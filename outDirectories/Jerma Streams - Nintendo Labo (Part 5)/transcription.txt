[1.14s -> 11.32s]  Bada! Hey guys, you can probably tell by the title. Labo VR.
[29.10s -> 37.03s]  Change the title? What do you mean? Cardboard VR? What's wrong with that?
[40.28s -> 52.94s]  Is Cardboard VR not a good title? No, not really. It's not. Why? Does it have to be funny?
[54.38s -> 71.75s]  Set your expectations real low, guys. This is a Labo stream. It's too funny. I don't know. How
[71.75s -> 84.98s]  about, like, how else would you describe what we're doing? This is Labo VR. It's Cardboard VR.
[85.70s -> 103.66s]  I'm to the point. Every time Jerma says Labo, drink. Labo, Labo, Labo, Labo, Labo, Labo, Labo,
[103.66s -> 118.44s]  Labo, Labo, Labo, Labo, Labo, Labo. Hope it's water. But there's nothing wrong with the title.
[122.25s -> 133.70s]  All right, we're keeping it. It's staying the way it is. Anyways, so we've got to talk about
[133.86s -> 138.58s]  Labo VR in particular, but I've got to, first of all, this is a special occasion.
[139.22s -> 147.34s]  We only do Labo VR. Well, we never do Labo VR. We've never done Labo VR. We only do Labo once.
[147.34s -> 160.73s]  Labo! Hey! We only do Labo, like, once a year. Three times a year. So I've got the finest
[160.73s -> 165.27s]  fucking grocery store wine you could possibly find. That actually looks kind of good.
[166.97s -> 170.95s]  Let's, I, I couldn't really, this is hard to get this open. So let's go ahead,
[171.67s -> 176.62s]  diaper bulge. Get out of here. We're going to do a little bit of a, I'm going to pop it,
[176.62s -> 188.46s]  and we're going to say, start the Labo! You ready? Start the Labo! That was the same audio
[188.46s -> 199.94s]  clip. Anyways, where's my glass? Right there. Let's see. This is, this is not going to be
[199.94s -> 204.34s]  good. No, I can't say shit like that. If I say shit like that, then I'm like, I don't
[204.34s -> 218.62s]  want to slander a company. It's probably good. Okay. Glass, hint of old Thai dishwasher soap,
[220.97s -> 227.64s]  hard water, and sediment. Oh, that sounds good. Okay, but I probably shouldn't do this
[227.64s -> 241.03s]  over the Labo. Where should I do this? This is dangerous. Did you hear that? It made the
[241.03s -> 251.45s]  pouring sound and nothing even came out. Listen to this. I can't even show you. Do you hear
[251.45s -> 266.82s]  that? Let it aerate. That's too, don't do a heavy pour. There you go. This is called
[266.82s -> 273.94s]  a copper thief. This was selected by the seller master select. It's probably going to be good.
[274.66s -> 278.84s]  All right, let me just move my diaper out of the way. I had to wear a diaper for this
[278.84s -> 282.44s]  stream just because I could just shit and piss in here. It's going to be a while.
[283.40s -> 288.44s]  You're also probably noticing, excuse me, Jeremy, what's going on with these? Are these
[288.44s -> 294.20s]  new? What is this? This doesn't look like yours. Well, I think my switch might be permanently dead.
[294.84s -> 306.34s]  This is italics's switch. So I didn't, I haven't turned on the switch in a long time.
[306.34s -> 312.44s]  It's been like at least like two or three months, three months. It hasn't even been
[312.44s -> 320.90s]  plugged in. It won't turn on. I think the lithium battery in it is permanently dead.
[321.70s -> 327.90s]  This wasn't $60 by the way. I'm moving this like over here. So now you fucking sickos can like
[327.90s -> 336.25s]  talk shit about my life. How did you break it? I didn't break it. It just, it won't turn on.
[337.29s -> 340.97s]  I can't, it won't charge. I can't even get it to the screen like the, hey, it's charging
[340.97s -> 352.71s]  screen to pop up. Whatever. Let's try this. What is in here? There's like pieces of wood in
[352.71s -> 366.62s]  here. Did I fuck this up already? That's sweet. There's some sweetness here. It looks
[366.62s -> 372.63s]  like a Jolly Rancher. What's this one called? This is a, okay, this is a bourbon red wine.
[372.63s -> 378.46s]  Bourbon red wine. Does that mean this is extra? All right, I gotta be careful. I need a,
[379.53s -> 382.81s]  whatever. This is a fuck you table. Who cares? Welcome to, this is Nintendo Labo if you don't
[382.81s -> 387.77s]  know. We're going to do the VR kit. The weird thing about the VR kit is the VR kit
[387.77s -> 397.00s]  for some reason decided to release in like three different packages. So this is the
[397.96s -> 406.25s]  Blaster and the headset. They sold out of the regular one. So I had to, I went around
[406.25s -> 412.58s]  looking all over the place for where I could get the other kits. This thing right here,
[413.06s -> 420.01s]  this like big camera elephant trunk, this shit's going to take about four hours to
[420.01s -> 430.36s]  build. This is the longest build in Labo history. This is going to take a long time.
[430.52s -> 434.28s]  So I'm actually kind of glad I only have the two here because it's going to be like a six
[434.28s -> 440.68s]  hour build just for these two. Plus I've already wasted like 12 minutes. So, you know,
[440.68s -> 446.28s]  that's what I do. I'll be ready for a long stream. And by the way, only drink alcohol
[446.28s -> 452.84s]  responsibly and only if it's legal in your city. You know, drink responsibly. Only
[452.84s -> 456.36s]  drink when you're going to build a Labo in the comfort of your home with wine. Don't do
[456.36s -> 465.35s]  it ever, ever again. All right, let's go. Let me get it on the screen. There it is.
[466.15s -> 470.07s]  You probably remember this setup here. It's going to take a week. No, it's not going to
[470.07s -> 482.49s]  take a week. What else we got? Get that out of here. It looks like I have a wicked
[482.49s -> 489.83s]  fat stomach. Do I? No, this ain't moving from here. This is like staying right fucking
[489.83s -> 495.21s]  here. I'm not taking this anywhere else. All right, so let's go. We're going to build
[495.21s -> 503.32s]  the headset first. We should have that good to go. I am ready. We're going to make the,
[503.32s -> 508.87s]  I think we're going to make the goggles first. No, I don't, do we have to practice?
[509.67s -> 521.91s]  I already know how to do this. Is this, okay, what a waste of paper. They put this in every
[521.91s -> 528.87s]  single Labo. It's this one right here. This is like the little french fry cup holder thing.
[530.81s -> 534.33s]  I don't need this right now. Move that out of the way. Actually, I don't need this whole
[534.33s -> 538.73s]  thing. Let's, okay, let's, let's go ahead and just do it. I know how to do this shit.
[538.73s -> 545.48s]  That's not my first ever time. All right, yeah, there it is. I, just to give you a rundown how
[545.48s -> 552.36s]  this works, you get a cardboard cut out here and you flip it over and it's grooves. And what
[552.36s -> 557.53s]  you do is you fold the grooves and you turn it into a little device. Put the wine on the
[557.53s -> 562.41s]  desk. It's going to be fine because I'm, this whole thing is going on the ground. I'm putting
[562.41s -> 565.85s]  on fucking pants. I'm going to go get like just jogging pants and put them on.
[566.73s -> 571.66s]  There's no way this strange happening like this. All right, that looks good over there.
[572.46s -> 582.42s]  You guys got me so fucking self-conscious every day. I can't wear, like I cannot wear these
[582.42s -> 591.19s]  pants. You guys are all immature. Grow up a little bit. All right, here we go. All right,
[591.19s -> 603.05s]  so we got this piece here. I can't even like see. Like this, I already know how to do,
[603.05s -> 608.87s]  I got to get a trash bag in here. It's going to be a long night. I already know how to do
[608.87s -> 618.34s]  this. I've done it like six times already. Don't grow up too much or you'll wind up like
[618.34s -> 624.14s]  Jerma985. Yeah, don't grow up too much. I can't wait to, I got a plan, by the way,
[624.14s -> 627.02s]  to how to get you, that's right, you sitting there right now. You're going to get to see
[627.02s -> 631.82s]  Nintendo Labo for yourself. Oh my god, it almost just happened within five minutes.
[633.86s -> 645.37s]  Okay, I'll listen to that guy. So it folds like this and then like that. Tab goes in here,
[647.24s -> 653.35s]  as you can see. Got the Nintendo Labo side. By the way, just want to make this real clear,
[653.35s -> 658.62s]  I am the only motherfucker on this whole website. On the whole website, and it slides in like that,
[658.62s -> 662.14s]  as you can see. I'm pretty much being nervous. I'm the only fucking person on the whole website
[662.14s -> 666.14s]  that does this. You're not going to find this anywhere else. You will never find somebody,
[666.14s -> 670.94s]  dude, what you see here building a Labo on the whole website. Find me another streamer.
[672.20s -> 679.50s]  Hasn't never happened. I'm the Labo guy. That's like the Jerma the Labo guy 985.
[680.65s -> 684.49s]  I can't wait till the Nintendo invites me to like the next Labo premiere event,
[685.38s -> 688.74s]  because I'm the only fucking person that's made any content of this goddamn game.
[692.58s -> 696.98s]  Oh, we're here at the Nintendo Labo event here with the exclusive streamers and YouTubers
[696.98s -> 700.66s]  that are really, really into the game and series. Look who's coming down the aisle.
[700.66s -> 705.46s]  Who's coming out of the limo? Oh, it's just Jerma985. He's the only fucking person.
[705.46s -> 714.41s]  I should just get on stage and do a fucking speech. He's coming down the aisle. That's a grocery
[714.41s -> 720.63s]  store. That's what the event is. It's not even like a cool theater. We're like the mayonnaise aisle.
[721.27s -> 732.65s]  All right, here we go. Don't swear. Stop swearing. I know I can rotate the camera
[732.65s -> 741.99s]  around with a little tool here. I never thought this was ever going to happen.
[743.61s -> 752.86s]  But this is actual, this is actual stomach sitting on table. That's not like clothes.
[753.58s -> 758.65s]  I don't, this is why I don't fucking ever turn on a camera. All right, I know what I'm doing.
[758.65s -> 773.77s]  Let's go. You tilt. You can zoom in by holding. Yeah, you go like this. I've got the boomer belly.
[778.07s -> 781.83s]  Reset the camera by pressing X. I've got a little toy. Can you see how good,
[781.83s -> 786.87s]  is it showing up well? Because this stream's about to go off the fucking rails. So
[787.83s -> 792.20s]  just wait till you get to play VR though. We're going to share it.
[792.92s -> 795.64s]  That, this camera right here is going in the headset. I was going to do two,
[796.28s -> 799.16s]  but it was impossible. There's no way it was going to fit in there.
[799.96s -> 803.46s]  Can you turn the music up a little louder? You want the music louder? The music sucks.
[804.26s -> 807.22s]  No, it doesn't. All right, that's, I already did this. Let's just skip it.
[808.18s -> 811.99s]  But these are cool. These are really cool. It takes a while to build.
[811.99s -> 822.20s]  You can get your friends over, grab a bottle of wine and do it. Do it. I just thought
[822.20s -> 825.96s]  about something right there. I'm going to go get into that. But we'll do that on the first
[825.96s -> 829.96s]  wine break. Just thought about it. You can just see the cogs turning in my brain.
[830.52s -> 839.43s]  They were just spinning. Box wine. This is actually bottle wine tonight, not box wine.
[840.89s -> 845.13s]  Write it down. I won't, no, I will not forget. Don't worry. Okay. Onto the real thing. Let's
[845.13s -> 860.71s]  build the headset. Oh, switch it. We're good. All right. So we're going to do the
[860.71s -> 888.84s]  pedal. What do you mean pedal? What? No, no, no, no, no, this is wrong. Hold on. I'll fix
[888.84s -> 914.73s]  this. Always keep a backup switch. Uh, yeah, it was in the other switch. That's right. This
[914.73s -> 921.82s]  like rich and I have to do the whole thing again. God damn it. They looked at how,
[921.82s -> 926.06s]  look, give me a break. You see how easy this is to fucking fuck this up. They're,
[926.06s -> 938.09s]  they're like this big. They're this big. Hold on. You can't read a microscope to read
[938.09s -> 952.07s]  the text on here. I'm not building that thing again. I already did it.
[956.46s -> 958.78s]  For a second, I thought they put it the wrong thing in the box. I was like, this is
[958.78s -> 965.96s]  no fucking way that somebody would do that. Right? There's no way. All right. Okay.
[967.16s -> 988.07s]  Everybody can relax. I'm ready. Okay. Your controllers have to be updated. All right.
[988.07s -> 994.74s]  Let's go. Should I not hold it? Is it like radiation coming in here? That like kind of
[994.74s -> 1003.45s]  freaks me out sometimes. Is it like electromagnetic fields like going, I feel like it's going to
[1003.45s -> 1007.93s]  interfere if I pick it up. You're going to get super powers if you just hold on to it.
[1007.93s -> 1021.37s]  Well, we'll start drinking. Oh, oh, oh, I can't fucking do that. These are not mine.
[1021.93s -> 1031.37s]  I just saw haha. You got like, you got like a hundred more of those to do it tonight.
[1031.37s -> 1040.42s]  Just going to tell you this is a fucking Nintendo labo stream. I guarantee you if
[1040.42s -> 1043.22s]  you've somebody keeps track of that, there'll be at least fucking each each one of you
[1043.22s -> 1050.79s]  will do that like fucking 30 times. Lick it. Why would this is not mine? I don't
[1050.79s -> 1058.18s]  lick things that are not mine. You're using up the supply that you get the idea.
[1059.06s -> 1072.94s]  You can tell me like cringy. I fucking dare you. What do you have? I would love to have
[1072.94s -> 1076.94s]  that one, Nintendo, but you only made like a certain amount of them and you can't buy
[1076.94s -> 1082.60s]  them anywhere. They were so scared that people didn't want to spend $80 on the whole
[1082.60s -> 1087.70s]  thing that they made half of those and half of these. I don't have this one. I have this
[1087.70s -> 1101.29s]  one. Lick the cartridge. It's not a rat tail. It's my hair coming down. Look,
[1103.26s -> 1109.32s]  restrict the use of VR mode for children six and under. VR mode is only suitable for
[1109.32s -> 1114.30s]  players age seven and above. Kids, please check with an adult. Do you want to allow
[1114.30s -> 1127.06s]  the use of VR mode? Six and under. All right, you're two. You can adjust your
[1127.06s -> 1131.70s]  VR mode settings here at any time. I don't have it yet. I need to make the VR headset.
[1133.11s -> 1145.67s]  No, I already did it. Isn't there a skip? Welcome to Nintendo Labo. Here, we're going
[1145.67s -> 1151.85s]  to show you how to make the fucking pencil holder. All right, I already did it. Just
[1151.85s -> 1160.76s]  skip. Wait, wait, what was that? What's that? What's that thing? What's the guy?
[1160.76s -> 1173.48s]  There's more? Oh shit, they never used A before completely. I know. I can't play
[1173.48s -> 1178.97s]  completely. Do this again. Put them wrong. Didn't lick the cartridge. I'm not going to
[1178.97s -> 1185.13s]  lick that cartridge. Guys, this thing said it was going to take like five hours to build it,
[1185.13s -> 1191.05s]  and it's been 20 fucking minutes and I've done the wrong cartridge. I'm going to be here all
[1191.05s -> 1199.34s]  night. Lick the cartridge. Why would you ever, what world would you want to live on to do that
[1200.70s -> 1208.50s]  about licking the cartridge? You, okay, you're doing this wrong. I really hate to
[1208.50s -> 1212.90s]  blow this up here, but I've had like three sips of wine and you're already asking me to
[1212.90s -> 1218.90s]  do weird fucked up shit. I know now that like future drunk Jeremy is not going to do that.
[1218.90s -> 1221.86s]  You've ruined it. You could have done that like in two hours and I would have done it.
[1222.50s -> 1237.50s]  Now I know. I mean, that's your fault, not mine. He's not going to do it. I already know.
[1237.50s -> 1244.06s]  I can hear. My internal monologue right now is locked in that I'm not going to lick that
[1244.06s -> 1247.90s]  cartridge. It's locked in and then nothing that can be done is not going to change. It's
[1247.90s -> 1256.60s]  not going to happen. It's already locked in. I can't believe I can't do all the other ones.
[1256.60s -> 1261.24s]  All right. This is going to take 30 to 60 minutes in Jeremy stream times. That's like two hours.
[1261.96s -> 1267.45s]  It's not going to take 30 minutes. We're going to make the actual goggles that go on your face.
[1268.17s -> 1281.14s]  Wait, is it actual glass? You actually put like a piece of glass in there.
[1285.30s -> 1292.49s]  Making the Toy-Con VR goggles. Four steps you need to complete. This is really actually
[1292.49s -> 1301.69s]  cool. VR lenses, VR goggles, the safety cap and then prepare to play. We don't need this anymore.
[1301.69s -> 1308.23s]  It's getting recycled. Don't worry. Everyone's like, oh, you can break it. It's getting
[1308.23s -> 1314.44s]  recycled. Don't worry. All right. So we need the VR lenses. Dip it in the wine. No, thanks.
[1315.08s -> 1322.79s]  The VR lenses are inside this box, but hold on a second. Don't go opening this box yet.
[1322.79s -> 1342.95s]  There are some warnings first. There's a snake in here. That's the warning. Oh,
[1342.95s -> 1356.33s]  Nintendo. You got me. Wait, what is the warning? Warning. Never use the VR lenses to look at the
[1356.33s -> 1368.39s]  sun or any other bright lights. You could damage your eyes. Should I try it? It's pretty
[1368.39s -> 1371.75s]  bright out right there. No, I'm not damaging my eyes for the sake of fucking comedy. No way.
[1373.40s -> 1377.48s]  Never place the VR lenses in direct sunlight or near a light source. Concentrated light can
[1377.48s -> 1388.97s]  burn nearby objects. What are they talking about? If these lenses are facing a certain
[1388.97s -> 1396.81s]  way, I can burn my house down? All right. What about warning three? No. All right. So let
[1396.81s -> 1406.46s]  me see. These are dangerous apparently. Don't look directly at the sun. All right. Look at
[1406.46s -> 1409.34s]  this. You got, I don't know. I know we're not doing this yet, but just look at this.
[1410.22s -> 1417.48s]  Look at this image on the left here. That looks like a superpower. That like looks cool
[1417.48s -> 1420.84s]  enough to, you know what I mean? That looks like somebody's shooting fire out of their eyes.
[1421.56s -> 1433.22s]  Is that really possible? All right. Well, there they are. Is that the only thing that's in
[1433.22s -> 1442.63s]  there? There's something else in here. I have to test it. Maybe. Maybe, but no, it's, it's,
[1442.63s -> 1446.63s]  the sun's gone. This, it's, it's not that, no, I don't have, I don't have a direct sunlight here.
[1447.59s -> 1452.70s]  Try to like do it like over here and like beam over here. It's too bad it's not like
[1452.70s -> 1459.45s]  noon. I don't think this is not for anything. All right. So what do we need? We need a sheet
[1459.45s -> 1467.24s]  A. I'm going to move this out of the way now. There's nothing else in the box. I'm
[1467.24s -> 1470.68s]  going to put it back in here though just to keep it safe because it's dangerous.
[1471.64s -> 1484.01s]  I remember the sun. No, I mean the sun's not at its peak right now. It is currently, it's 4 30,
[1484.97s -> 1492.25s]  4 30 p.m. Pacific daylight time. So it means the sun is no longer, it's going down. The sun
[1492.25s -> 1501.61s]  doesn't hit this side anyways. All right. Here's A. A. No, not that one. It's another, it's,
[1501.61s -> 1507.02s]  it's A2. So it's this one. All right. I'm going to move this shit out of the way.
[1507.74s -> 1520.94s]  Get the blind out of here before I cause a fucking huge problem. Lick the cardboard. You guys,
[1521.66s -> 1529.37s]  I ain't doing any of that shit. So here is the main piece here. So we're going to move
[1529.37s -> 1538.66s]  this big piece here. This big one, the yellow one. Punch it out. I know you guys, I know
[1538.66s -> 1545.16s]  you guys missed those satisfying noises like this one. I know you guys missed those satisfying
[1545.16s -> 1553.38s]  noises. All right. It's a great big yellow one and then I'm assuming we're just going to
[1553.38s -> 1559.14s]  punch it around other pieces of the sheet later. Okay. Don't forget, if you have any trouble,
[1559.14s -> 1563.75s]  you can use the back button. Yep. All right. These goggles will be your window into a whole
[1563.75s -> 1567.99s]  new world. They're pretty important. So let's make sure to make them right. Don't screw it
[1567.99s -> 1572.55s]  up. Be careful not to mix up the front and the back. Pay attention to the screen so that
[1572.55s -> 1579.99s]  you always have the correct side up like that. That's correct. No mistakes allowed. I don't
[1579.99s -> 1583.19s]  make mistakes when I play this. Make sure you have plenty of space when working on big
[1583.19s -> 1588.82s]  pieces. It might help to put away any pieces you don't need for now. Yeah, I'm good.
[1591.40s -> 1597.99s]  I got this. I got this completely. All right. Flip it over. Before we start folding,
[1597.99s -> 1602.31s]  take a good look at where the fold lines are. Right. Okay. They're all over the place here.
[1603.45s -> 1609.37s]  Yeah. When making fold lines, try to crease the whole length firmly with both hands. I know.
[1610.33s -> 1616.38s]  This is our first fold. Okay. Both hands. Crease it right here. Ready? First fold of the
[1616.38s -> 1629.19s]  evening. Hey, I want to, nevermind. That's good. That's creased. I didn't even do the
[1629.19s -> 1632.07s]  right one. I didn't even do the right one. Not paying attention. It's this one.
[1634.98s -> 1640.26s]  Already did it wrong. You already did the wrong fold. Don't make any mistakes, kids.
[1641.58s -> 1652.41s]  Just make a mistake on the first fold. Looks good. Good job. Yeah. That's nice and creased.
[1654.52s -> 1659.94s]  Now for the two sides. Both these come up. I think all of them. I'm just going to do
[1659.94s -> 1668.90s]  them all this way. I'm going to punch out this shit too. All right. Nice and tight.
[1669.62s -> 1675.66s]  I got to fucking don't do that. I'm going to make, every time I start to make a room of mess,
[1675.66s -> 1679.42s]  it just stays a mess forever. And I always talk about how I'm going to clean it and I never,
[1679.42s -> 1686.14s]  ever do. Ever. What do you mean ruin it? What did I do? What are you talking about?
[1686.14s -> 1692.94s]  I had to punch the holes out. What do you mean ruin it? The long use ball. Okay. That
[1692.94s -> 1700.17s]  one and then the, yeah, right here. I didn't, how did I fuck it up? What are you talking
[1700.17s -> 1718.34s]  about? How is it fucked up? I didn't do anything wrong. These both fold in and then the tabs go.
[1719.38s -> 1725.30s]  And then I believe this is going to, ooh, this is where it gets tricky. Oh, ruined. Oh,
[1725.30s -> 1740.46s]  it's ruining it. Looks good. This looks good too. This fucking shiatsu. So that, then these tabs
[1741.10s -> 1751.83s]  go down like that. Push that out. Destroying it. You guys have never built a fucking labo
[1751.83s -> 1759.50s]  before. You have no idea. How many of you have built a labo before? Show of hands. None of you.
[1761.53s -> 1769.77s]  You know how they say, oh man, yeah, I, streamer, influencer. Yeah, I played labo and I,
[1769.77s -> 1772.89s]  I mean, like a lot of people really thought it was cool and they bought it. Like a bunch of
[1772.89s -> 1779.13s]  you guys bought it. I don't think any of you bought it. I've done this like fucking five
[1779.13s -> 1785.19s]  times. You probably, maybe three of you have bought one. Like it doesn't do anything.
[1791.53s -> 1797.70s]  Paid off. Wait, did I not do this one? These tabs fold, right? Am I doing the folds wrong? I
[1797.70s -> 1803.08s]  better not be. Did I ever broke it? It's over. All right. If one piece breaks, I quit.
[1807.19s -> 1820.20s]  These come up. Those ones fold over. Now we have to get the glass in here. Okay.
[1821.16s -> 1825.08s]  So then that comes over here. Get that out of direct sunlight. Don't touch that.
[1825.98s -> 1833.61s]  Here we go again. I need to know. I need to know. I'm going to look at a light
[1835.66s -> 1846.98s]  just quickly. Are you in there, lenses? Come on out. Sup. Hi there. We're the VR lenses. Good to
[1846.98s -> 1853.82s]  meet you. Sorry for all the warnings. Please don't peel off the film on the lenses.
[1855.14s -> 1863.45s]  Sorry for all the warnings. You are real. Try to avoid touching the round lenses themselves.
[1863.45s -> 1874.57s]  They need to be nice and clean. I think I already touched them a bunch. Okay. Behold
[1874.57s -> 1879.43s]  the VR lenses. Time to attach these guys to the big piece we creased before.
[1880.31s -> 1901.85s]  All right. Hold on. Where did they go? So don't, but don't take this off. All right. So don't
[1901.85s -> 1911.83s]  peel that off. So this is going over here. Bring it over to the side with the tabs we let standing
[1911.83s -> 1930.89s]  up and slot it in from below. What? Like this? Okay. So those tabs are up, right? I did that,
[1930.89s -> 1941.11s]  right? I'm not touching the lenses. I have not touched the lenses one time. Now let's make
[1941.11s -> 1955.70s]  a quick check. Does everything look the same on the screen? Yeah. Yeah. It does. I'm gonna
[1955.70s -> 1959.86s]  have to lick those lenses clean. Remove. Oh God. Remove these two pieces from sheet B.
[1959.86s -> 1980.26s]  Already going to B. Which ones? The two canisters? Lick them. You guys are fucked.
[1980.26s -> 1983.86s]  All right. Take out the middle. Let's punch them in your view so you can see how cool
[1983.86s -> 1999.27s]  it looks. All right. Good. So these are both, these are identical. So then these go on
[1999.27s -> 2008.39s]  sides like this. Hey, we want action too. Use these on the round holes as guides
[2010.95s -> 2020.84s]  here to line everything up perfectly. The black side should be facing up like this. Okay.
[2023.93s -> 2028.62s]  The stream's over. Oh, because I ripped a little bit. It doesn't matter. You're not
[2028.62s -> 2032.70s]  going to fucking see this. It's going to be on my head. I'm going to let they fold.
[2033.66s -> 2040.74s]  Oh fuck. Get out the bag with the special parts. Are we going to rubber band this? No.
[2041.62s -> 2047.43s]  Here's the special bag. Don't look. Don't look this directly in the sun.
[2047.43s -> 2050.55s]  Do not put this up to your eye. It'll fucking burn your house down. Don't do it.
[2052.90s -> 2069.02s]  All right. Two of the gray washers. There's a lot of gray washes in here. Just two of them.
[2069.58s -> 2087.70s]  There's a bag within a bag. Only Nintendo. And Lego. And every other company that makes
[2087.70s -> 2095.10s]  the small, loseable parts. Okay. Two washers. Got them. Now what? I gotta put the seat
[2095.10s -> 2104.71s]  down. This is killing me. I'm already sweating. It's fucking hot. I'm going to go like turn the AC
[2104.71s -> 2116.86s]  on. All right. Two of the gray washers. Punch it through here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
[2116.86s -> 2120.38s]  One after the slip the holes in the pieces of the sticky Audi bits. Wait.
[2122.15s -> 2127.43s]  Slip the holes in the pieces over the sticky Audi bits on the sides of the VR lenses.
[2128.23s -> 2146.95s]  Like this. Okay. And then a washer over it. This is where the washer come in. Here goes
[2146.95s -> 2156.74s]  nothing. The washer should snap on like this. Like that. I'm not touching the lens. Don't worry.
[2156.74s -> 2176.25s]  Don't freak out. I'm not touching the lens. God damn it. Get on there. All right. I did
[2176.25s -> 2192.28s]  touch the lens this time. I'm touching all over the lens. I swear to God. I can't.
[2193.70s -> 2201.38s]  Oh no. Oh my God. Why is this so fucking hard to do? That's the right side.
[2201.38s -> 2235.77s]  You don't understand. It's not working. Oh, they really went down in quality, didn't they?
[2235.77s -> 2249.51s]  Says the vehicle. I don't understand. Guys, it's supposed to just snap on. It's supposed to snap
[2249.51s -> 2281.61s]  on. It's not on. It's not on. I'm not too weak. It's just, it's not cut. I got it. It's
[2281.61s -> 2286.42s]  not cut right. It's not cut right. I got a defect. You want me to prove that? Look at that.
[2286.98s -> 2290.74s]  You want to prove my defect? Look at, look at, look at the defect that I have.
[2292.86s -> 2310.04s]  I am defective, as you can see. It's warped. Same thing on the other side. Great. Go back.
[2310.04s -> 2318.44s]  I did it. No, I didn't do it wrong any time. No, that's correct. Same thing on the other side.
[2319.00s -> 2328.58s]  And that snaps in. So he's going to lock it in. See if it's as difficult to do this one.
[2328.58s -> 2336.31s]  This one doesn't look warped. Done. In one, in one second. This one not warped.
[2336.31s -> 2344.49s]  Let's make sure it's on there. Good. Not even warped. All right, so that's in there now. That's
[2344.49s -> 2353.30s]  done. I've got like sediment on my face. What are we doing down here? All right. Looks good.
[2353.30s -> 2358.97s]  We're going to fold it over. The VR lenses are fully attached. This piece is taking up a lot
[2358.97s -> 2374.28s]  of space. Let's fold it up a bit to be more compact. So this comes up. So we go like that
[2376.44s -> 2387.34s]  and then like this. And that comes down here like that. Okay, we're making a McDonald's
[2387.34s -> 2392.66s]  Happy Meal. Tuck the cardboard underneath the plastic right here. You'll need to do
[2392.66s -> 2405.96s]  this again later, so remember it well. Like that. Okay, it's in. And with that,
[2406.84s -> 2414.39s]  the VR lenses are ready. They are? Phew, that was quite the complex piece to start with,
[2414.39s -> 2419.74s]  but we're not done yet. Maybe we ought to take a quick break. You got it. So how does this go?
[2419.74s -> 2443.90s]  Like this? All right, so that's that. Let's go two out of four. Windrate. Yeah, I gotta windrate
[2443.90s -> 2448.68s]  real quick. All right, so if I can move this out of the way. Let's get this in a spot
[2448.68s -> 2455.75s]  where I know where it is. Right over here. I was gonna throw that, but that would be
[2455.75s -> 2462.90s]  better to do. All right, so let's get B, sheet B again. And we do the big piece.
[2463.86s -> 2482.81s]  Whole thing. Can you get into my car? I don't know what that means. All right,
[2482.81s -> 2491.77s]  is this the only one we need? Just B. This is gonna be a pretty complex shape,
[2494.46s -> 2501.94s]  apparently. So I gotta punch out a lot of this crap. Hold on. So this is nothing. This is
[2501.94s -> 2515.27s]  just a big three. Three. And then the middle stays in. Now this stays in. This pops out.
[2518.78s -> 2524.84s]  He said ear. Oh, sorry. My eyes aren't that good. It's hard for me to see all the way over
[2524.84s -> 2542.17s]  there. Here comes the counting joke. We all think it's so funny to count. One, two, three,
[2542.17s -> 2548.17s]  four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. It's my favorite. I love it.
[2548.81s -> 2557.10s]  So we've got this is good. Everything's done. Okay, this will form the slot into
[2557.10s -> 2562.79s]  which we insert the console itself. Lay it out printed side up and look at these fold lines
[2562.79s -> 2573.19s]  in the middle. I see them. So this goes across this. Is this is this foldable? This
[2573.19s -> 2597.59s]  doesn't look like it folds. I guess it does. Okay, then is volume too low? Yeah,
[2597.59s -> 2604.34s]  that's better, right? Is that like a little better? No, not really. It's fine. I'll turn
[2604.34s -> 2609.14s]  it down later. Don't worry. I'll panic go back and forth, lowering and increasing the volume over
[2609.14s -> 2614.74s]  the next four hours. All right, then this one comes up this way. This is a tricky one.
[2615.54s -> 2628.07s]  This is tricky, guys. All right, so that's done. And that's done. So we got these two
[2628.07s -> 2650.33s]  folded up. We should do these flaps at the ends too. Both flaps? Yeah. You're in the
[2650.33s -> 2655.64s]  midst of dealing with finals. Well, good luck. Hopefully you ace them. Hopefully you get
[2655.64s -> 2667.62s]  at least a B minus. These come up? Yeah, the whole thing does. My eyes are getting so bad.
[2668.26s -> 2681.43s]  Hope these tabs go up. Of course they do. Two? That should be it. Now we're going to use the
[2681.43s -> 2692.94s]  sponge stickers from the bag. Sponge stickers? Ah, this thing here. I dropped something.
[2692.94s -> 2697.50s]  That's the core. Fuck, there's wine on it. Oh, I can't like get over there. Hold on.
[2698.22s -> 2708.20s]  There's no way to get this reliably without causing a problem. There's three different
[2708.20s -> 2714.12s]  problems here. There's like my ass in this camera. There's like fall over table.
[2741.26s -> 2748.41s]  Okay. Why do you wear short shorts? These are not short shorts. They're regular shorts.
[2748.41s -> 2757.06s]  I'm just sitting down like a normal human. They're just shorts and I'm sitting. Sorry,
[2757.06s -> 2762.65s]  I don't have like shorts that go down to my ankles. A bunch of fucking prankers
[2763.90s -> 2775.18s]  pranking me all the time. All right, that is what I need. So then I get to tear these off.
[2775.18s -> 2778.38s]  These stickers are going to stop the console from slipping around. It doesn't matter if they're
[2778.38s -> 2787.27s]  a little wonky. Put all these on here. There are eight spots to place the stickers and they're
[2787.27s -> 2791.91s]  very, they're helpfully numbered. Pay close attention to the markers as we place them.
[2793.75s -> 2797.27s]  So just put smoothing the piece out to make sure it's nice and flat will help the
[2797.27s -> 2800.31s]  stickers sit properly. Right? Well, you just made me fold the whole fucking thing. So
[2801.27s -> 2810.74s]  that's not going to happen. First up are the smaller stickers. There's smaller ones.
[2811.86s -> 2820.54s]  Start with the spot. Oh, I can't see. So I have to tear this off. Do what? Is it tear
[2820.54s -> 2829.61s]  off nice and clean? It does. Okay. All right. So we just align these up. So it goes like
[2829.61s -> 2840.86s]  that, like this. Oh, I'm going to fuck this whole thing up. So it goes like halfway on.
[2840.86s -> 2844.46s]  All right. Here we go. Can't screw it up. I only got one. There are no extras in here.
[2845.42s -> 2870.74s]  It's like this. Right? Right? Yeah. That looks good. Yeah. Now that's, that's perfectly fine.
[2872.18s -> 2878.42s]  That's perfect. You couldn't ask for a better, but the sticky stuff on the edge of that,
[2878.42s -> 2883.86s]  though. Okay. Yeah. So you're going to fold it over. Fold over the sticky sides like that.
[2883.86s -> 2891.02s]  I was going to say that wouldn't make any sense. Yeah. They were kidding when they
[2891.02s -> 2898.33s]  said this is going to take a while. That's going to do that with, I'm assuming one, two, three,
[2898.33s -> 2909.32s]  four. Let's just see. One, two, three, right? Three and four together here. Okay. So one,
[2909.32s -> 2918.38s]  two, three, four. Let's just get this done nice and quick. Not too quick though,
[2918.38s -> 2923.66s]  because I don't want to ruin it. Somebody's gave community subs like an hour ago.
[2925.43s -> 2935.51s]  Uh, Dr. Steen. Thanks for the five community subs. 20 minutes ago. It's hard for me to see.
[2940.49s -> 2948.55s]  Oh God. Good DZ. No. Those are from last night. No, they're not. That's like 18 minutes ago.
[2948.55s -> 2957.30s]  I've been streaming for like, I've been streaming for like 30 minutes. I can't wait
[2957.30s -> 2961.64s]  till you guys get to see this. We're going to experience this together. It's going to be so
[2961.64s -> 2967.78s]  much fucking fun. I cannot wait. I didn't even sleep last night because I knew how much fun
[2967.78s -> 2971.70s]  this is going to be. It's like Christmas. You're waiting for Santa. You're waiting for Santa.
[2971.70s -> 2978.82s]  Santa's not here yet, but he will be, he will be in like six hours. I can't get this off.
[2985.30s -> 3004.30s]  I can't get this one off. I probably looked like so ugly right there. All right. So I'm
[3004.30s -> 3007.34s]  doing this right, right? So this goes here and this hit, wait, but has it fold over?
[3007.34s -> 3020.18s]  Or it just doesn't? Huh? How is this? Oh, holy shit. I almost just messed it up.
[3020.18s -> 3024.34s]  I was going to put it over here. It's supposed to go like there. I almost just blew that.
[3024.34s -> 3041.80s]  That would have been really bad. It's Nintendo Labo. So guys, I gotta tell you something.
[3043.78s -> 3048.66s]  I went back to the dentist, right? I had another dentist appointment today. I was there
[3048.66s -> 3053.86s]  earlier and you have no fucking idea how fucked up this was. So I'm in the chair,
[3053.86s -> 3063.64s]  right? I don't want to mess this up. Where does this one go? No, it's not that. Put it over here.
[3063.64s -> 3077.83s]  They both go side by side. Three, four. Yep. Okay. Three. And let's get this other one. Four.
[3077.83s -> 3091.80s]  Then these, these pieces of, these ones are bigger somehow. Oh, 15 turtles. They make
[3091.80s -> 3102.87s]  these things so hard to fucking remove. I think that looks good, right? Both these fold over,
[3103.67s -> 3117.42s]  I hope. All right. Then what do I do with the big ones? So these are longer and they go
[3118.06s -> 3129.06s]  just across the whole thing. All right. What are you saying? Seinfeld? What was the dentist
[3129.06s -> 3133.74s]  story? Oh, you can't believe it. So how about the chair? No, that's a joke because I've had,
[3133.74s -> 3140.06s]  I've had three dentist stories in the last two weeks. Tell the rest of the dentist story.
[3142.22s -> 3151.08s]  So how about the dentist? All right. That's correct, right? Yeah. Too long one. Then here
[3151.08s -> 3159.54s]  and here. How the fuck did that go? I have no idea. And? No, there is no and. I've already
[3159.54s -> 3166.55s]  told it. I told it two days ago. The joke is I have a third dentist story. But you know,
[3166.55s -> 3170.31s]  that's, that's just the punch line. There is no punch line. Oh, here's another dentist story
[3170.31s -> 3180.76s]  incoming. There is no punch line. I wasn't even making a joke. I was making a reference
[3180.76s -> 3192.50s]  to me having problems with the dentist every day. I need closure. There is, why do you need
[3192.50s -> 3203.29s]  closure on a non-existent story that didn't happen? All right. Speed it up. These go
[3203.29s -> 3212.62s]  across here and then here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Yes. I've got bad teeth.
[3213.96s -> 3222.66s]  What did you say? Have you seen these? I can bite. I can take a Jolly Rancher guys and
[3222.66s -> 3230.81s]  go like this and I can bite right through it. I was that guy in middle school and high school
[3230.81s -> 3236.73s]  that had the fucking steel teeth. You guys remember now and laters? I used to just put
[3236.73s -> 3239.77s]  them in and just stop chewing and people would fucking gasp and freak out and like my teeth are
[3239.77s -> 3255.93s]  gonna get ripped out. Nope. We'll be done with the tedious part here in a second.
[3256.65s -> 3263.19s]  That explains a lot actually. Does it though? What does that explain?
[3264.78s -> 3269.22s]  I'm, I feel like that doesn't explain a whole lot. I feel like there's way more to
[3269.22s -> 3283.38s]  that story. Where's the other one? I'm missing one. Where'd it go? Where's eight? Where did
[3283.38s -> 3320.12s]  eight go? Check the table crease? No. Where is it? One, two, three, four, five. Check the
[3320.12s -> 3333.62s]  VOD. No. There's one more. What the fuck did I do with it? Christ. I bent it too.
[3335.61s -> 3344.02s]  They look exactly the same. Give me a break. All right. Now I have to like move this back
[3344.02s -> 3350.26s]  because the table is now out of the view. I need to go back here. There we go. No,
[3350.26s -> 3361.42s]  I'll get a little closer to you guys. Hey. He doesn't know. I don't know very much. You're
[3361.42s -> 3368.73s]  right. See you have this, you have this like periscope right now. You can like see everything.
[3368.73s -> 3372.73s]  You can like zoom in and be like, what's that stain? I don't know there's a stain on my
[3372.73s -> 3379.37s]  shirt. I have no idea. Did I eat like a hot dog with mustard on it earlier? Yes, I did.
[3379.37s -> 3395.26s]  I don't know. I may have dropped something. I don't care. I don't know. All right. So now
[3395.26s -> 3401.56s]  these turn over and fold in. All right. We can finally be done with this tedious sticker game.
[3404.89s -> 3413.70s]  That and then like this. Come on. All right. Done. Finally. That took a million years.
[3415.59s -> 3425.50s]  The whole thing's done. Fold it over. So is a hot dog a sandwich? No, I would call it a sub.
[3426.22s -> 3430.46s]  I mean a sub would. Is a sub a sandwich? Sub sandwich, right? I guess it is a sandwich.
[3434.38s -> 3438.22s]  But a lot of people tell you it's not a sandwich, that it's a hoagie or it's a grinder.
[3438.78s -> 3445.18s]  It's not a sandwich. It's a hoagie. It's a grinder, right? Hot dog is not. Well, hot dog is.
[3446.54s -> 3466.46s]  It is. What happens here now? Well, I played Zelda VR. Well, this is not my switch. So I
[3466.46s -> 3473.40s]  don't. My switch is dead. Like permanently dead. Unless I did something wrong, which I
[3473.40s -> 3479.80s]  know I didn't. All right. So this folds all the way over and then attaches together like this.
[3480.44s -> 3489.51s]  I'm assuming that the arrows line up and line up the markings and push it in firmly.
[3490.47s -> 3500.25s]  Once it slides in like this, how the fuck does that go in? I guess like that.
[3501.53s -> 3509.93s]  Are taco sandwiches? I mean they could be. If you want to break it down by it just it's
[3509.93s -> 3522.92s]  very definition. That one's in. All right. That's good. So that's done. Is everything
[3522.92s -> 3530.58s]  lined up perfectly like this? Make sure your piece matches up. Yeah, I think so. Right.
[3530.58s -> 3538.68s]  What do you guys think? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Flour tortilla. Flour. I mean, I don't know.
[3538.68s -> 3544.70s]  I'm not going to. I'm not going to get in a fight over this. So give the slot a check
[3544.70s -> 3552.97s]  from the side too. If it looks a little at all wonky, just straighten it up. I mean,
[3552.97s -> 3560.86s]  it's a little wonky. A little bit. This looks like I'm about to put a hard drive in here.
[3564.12s -> 3571.35s]  Here's my new keyless hard drive bay. Toolless hard drive. All right. This is wonky, but it'll
[3571.35s -> 3580.50s]  do. Does it really matter? I got a fucking Vive set up. Do you think I'd give a shit about
[3580.50s -> 3593.11s]  this being wonky by like 5%? I got a Vive right here. All right. That's good. Stand it
[3593.11s -> 3601.94s]  back up. And with that, how does this connect to here? Let's see if your console slot does
[3601.94s -> 3606.26s]  its job. Now is also a good time to straighten your slot out if it's gotten crooked at all.
[3609.27s -> 3639.03s]  So I have to slide that into here and make sure it fits. Ow. And it does. That fits pretty
[3639.03s -> 3650.68s]  good. Snug. Fits in there. So it can come out nice and easy too. That's a perfect fit.
[3651.86s -> 3661.43s]  Nice. Let's stick that back in. All right. It should come back on the screen here in a second.
[3661.43s -> 3677.14s]  All right. Let's go. Not on my screen though. Shit's too loud. That's better. All right. So
[3677.14s -> 3698.92s]  that works. Now, where do I put this from here? This is just porn music. This is not porn
[3698.92s -> 3713.83s]  music. What are you talking about? This is like arcade claw machine music. This is not
[3713.83s -> 3721.56s]  pornography music. This is the song you hear playing over and over again inside of every
[3721.56s -> 3726.54s]  Dave and Buster's you've ever been inside ever in your life. But that's not true. They play
[3726.54s -> 3732.44s]  like, they play the hits. They play the hits. I'm wrong. I'm sorry. All right. What
[3732.44s -> 3739.64s]  are you B? Yeah. What the fuck are you watching? What are you talking about?
[3746.62s -> 3759.64s]  That's porn music. What does this one do? Dude, I'm starting to feel like a little
[3759.64s -> 3763.32s]  drunk right now. Maybe I should like lick something that's a small cartridge related
[3763.32s -> 3774.14s]  thing. Oh, that'd be like fucking funny. All right. So let's go. What's this piece for?
[3774.14s -> 3778.38s]  Your nose, of course. Leave the printed side facing up as you crease these fools.
[3778.38s -> 3793.74s]  Okay. All right. Crease this up there. Any other piece? I wish I had a nose.
[3794.46s -> 3800.47s]  So this is going to like slip on like this. I think my nose is too big for this.
[3802.26s -> 3806.02s]  Yeah. I've got like a schnoz. So I don't know if this is going to work.
[3809.26s -> 3819.91s]  We'll see. We will find out very shortly. So that goes up like this. Okay. Look,
[3819.91s -> 3823.51s]  you want to see how disgusting of a human I really am? I just like put this on my
[3823.51s -> 3836.07s]  nose for a second. Who's that? Who's that villain? There's a villain. There's a bad guy
[3836.07s -> 3844.09s]  in like comic books that's always covered in like grease. What's his name? There's like a
[3844.09s -> 3864.84s]  greasy villain. I don't know. The Silver Surfer? The Silver Surfer is like kind of just covered
[3864.84s -> 3874.76s]  in oil, right? Yeah, I would be the Silver Surfer. He's fucking cool too, man. He like
[3874.76s -> 3882.12s]  skis around and blows up planets, right? That's like his MO, right? That's what he does.
[3888.06s -> 3898.10s]  No, no, no. That's Iceman. What does the Silver Surfer do? What is the Silver Surfer? What's
[3898.10s -> 3907.03s]  the difference between Silver Surfer and Iceman? They're the same. I don't, I can't. If you
[3907.03s -> 3912.63s]  had like a crime lineup and you told me to pick out the Silver Surfer and you had Iceman,
[3912.63s -> 3917.03s]  you had Flame Guy and you had like Colossus, I don't know if I'd be able to pick him out.
[3917.03s -> 3934.18s]  It would be hard. Iceman, I mean, what? He's like chrome. Yeah. What does he do?
[3934.98s -> 3949.62s]  He's silver and he surfs. Isn't he a fantastic four villain? No wonder those movies have been
[3949.62s -> 3958.95s]  so bad. What a cursed franchise. Wait, okay. What the hell's going on? It goes this way
[3958.95s -> 3979.38s]  and then you do it the other way. So it's that and then that side. Yep. Fantastic four.
[3983.24s -> 3986.60s]  We got, okay, what is this? Let's get the smooths. No more stickers. I don't want to
[3986.60s -> 3993.51s]  put more stickers on here. We only need one sticker for now. Thank God. Was this,
[3993.51s -> 4005.86s]  is this to like determine where you are in the room? Wait, don't do this yet.
[4005.86s -> 4015.02s]  First fold the piece firmly in half like that. So that's that. This,
[4015.90s -> 4021.69s]  they're, yes, they are lined up perfectly. This part needs to be neatly lined up. It's easy
[4021.69s -> 4031.99s]  to get it wrong. Be careful. That's in there. That's perfect. Now using the star symbol as a
[4031.99s -> 4038.63s]  guide, apply the first half of the sticker and then it wraps around. You kind of like
[4038.63s -> 4047.16s]  an adhesive tape. All right, I guess, is that what this is for? To be adhesive tape?
[4047.88s -> 4058.34s]  These are thin too. Oh boy, this is really thin. Make sure you guys can see.
[4060.06s -> 4069.77s]  Fuck. Damn it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Got it. And then fold it over the other side.
[4073.08s -> 4084.76s]  No air bubbles. Good. Yeah, so it is just like adhesive tape. Everybody calm down. Stream
[4084.76s -> 4097.08s]  over, folks. Time to go home. What? Why are you going home? Don't go home. We've got,
[4097.16s -> 4101.24s]  we've got a whole bottle of wine here. Are you going to go home? No, you stay
[4104.22s -> 4115.85s]  or go to a different channel that you enjoy. See you later. Don't leave me. Don't leave me here.
[4115.85s -> 4119.93s]  If you leave, I'm just a guy folding cardboard drinking wine. You can't leave.
[4121.72s -> 4129.56s]  Don't leave me here. I'm just like a sicko if you all leave. All right, flip the piece
[4129.56s -> 4137.50s]  over and show it on screen and lift this part up. Okay. Like the second you guys all leave,
[4137.50s -> 4150.12s]  I just become the weirdo. What'd you do on a Saturday night? I just drank and played with
[4150.12s -> 4159.58s]  a kid's cardboard toy for six hours. Oh, you didn't like, you did? Yeah. Yeah. Don't
[4159.58s -> 4173.19s]  you have a girlfriend? Yeah. Where was she? I don't know. You know, I can't, no, this
[4173.19s -> 4182.62s]  can't be like that. All right. So we just slide this into here. This is kind of an
[4182.62s -> 4193.30s]  awkward way to do that. That looks good. Check the closet. No, I already did that before the
[4193.30s -> 4198.26s]  stream starts. She's not in there. Stand it straight. Time to stand the whole piece up
[4198.26s -> 4207.08s]  nice and sprayed. That's the way. Okay. So it does stand on its own. I'm gonna get it straight
[4207.08s -> 4215.67s]  like this. There you go. Okay. The nose piece is complete. So how does my nose go in here?
[4215.67s -> 4241.61s]  Like this? This hurts. I'm just a rooster. I guess it's supposed to be like that. The
[4241.61s -> 4246.17s]  bridge of my nose is so fucked up. Those are gonna be painful. All right. Fit the nose into
[4246.17s -> 4252.68s]  the main lens frame. Open up the top and lay it out flat. All right. We gotta do some surgery
[4252.68s -> 4260.17s]  here. Excuse me. Make sure you get that line over there. I don't want that to go down.
[4260.89s -> 4268.02s]  So then this, how does this open? So this goes like this. So you pop it out here
[4268.90s -> 4279.43s]  and then lay it out like that. Now move the nose piece into position, into position,
[4280.07s -> 4288.31s]  into position, into position. Why was I saying that so weird? Like that. Oh, there's a little
[4288.31s -> 4292.39s]  slot there. But now for this part, it'll be easiest if you hold the lens piece as shown.
[4294.78s -> 4299.66s]  Yeah. Slide the red tab with the smooth sticker right into the slot in between the lenses.
[4303.18s -> 4307.10s]  Let's check from the other side too. Just look firmly inserted. So it just goes in here.
[4308.62s -> 4328.14s]  That goes like this. And that's it. It's in. That's in. No, it's not. Fuck. How do I keep
[4328.14s -> 4336.39s]  it in there? Let's check from the other side too. Just look for, it's not firmly inserted.
[4338.33s -> 4346.97s]  Show auto. No, no. I'm building a VR headset. No, we're not going to show auto. No auto.
[4347.69s -> 4354.38s]  I'm not showing auto. Show auto. Yeah. Where are we going to put him? Where's he going to go?
[4354.94s -> 4360.76s]  There's no room for him in here. No, I'm not showing. I'm not. All right. I'll show auto in
[4360.76s -> 4371.13s]  like two hours. Okay. How does this go in? Let's add the console slot. So this is, it
[4371.13s -> 4384.81s]  goes like this and then spins this way. Just like that. Down here. This is ridiculous.
[4384.81s -> 4392.65s]  How am I going to see this? It's two little feet should slide neatly into place in here.
[4393.69s -> 4412.54s]  Is this the wrong way? All right. It's two little feet are in there now. In. Come on,
[4412.54s -> 4424.65s]  get in there. Is it in? It's two little feet go in and then now lift the middle flap and
[4424.65s -> 4429.21s]  join it to this slot at the top of the nose piece. It might be tough, but push it all the
[4429.21s -> 4442.28s]  way in. Okay. So is this even in there? So this, I can't even tell if it's even in.
[4442.28s -> 4445.96s]  I think it is. All right. So then this piece comes up. I didn't fold this fucking piece. I
[4445.96s -> 4452.39s]  didn't fold this piece backwards. Why didn't somebody tell me I didn't do that? Nobody
[4452.39s -> 4477.26s]  told me I didn't fold it. Is it in? Oh, okay. Now it's in. Is that good? Oh,
[4478.97s -> 4493.38s]  no. God damn it. The whole thing came apart. A bunch of trained engineers to put this shit
[4493.38s -> 4519.72s]  together with one hand. Get back in there. And this feet go in there. All right. All
[4519.72s -> 4521.72s]  right. All right. All right. All right. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[4523.67s -> 4534.44s]  It's in. It's in. Done. That's it. That's it. And hey, Otto can fix it. Otto's not coming up
[4534.44s -> 4540.22s]  here. Can you see the little, can you see the console slots, little feet poking out the side?
[4550.41s -> 4563.08s]  Yes. Yes, I can. Yes. See? And on the other side. Yes, I can see the little thing popping
[4563.08s -> 4570.68s]  out. Oh, and the bottom of the slot is still properly connected, right? Always best to make
[4570.68s -> 4583.93s]  sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Great. Then let's finish this thing up. First, roll the lens piece over
[4583.93s -> 4601.34s]  onto its front. Okay. If it lines up perfectly with this fold here, the next part should be
[4601.34s -> 4609.27s]  a piece of cake. It does. I would call that, I would call that perfect. If I were going to
[4609.27s -> 4614.86s]  get a ruler out here. Lift up the great big top flap and tuck it under the plastic here
[4614.86s -> 4634.30s]  like we did before. Okay. So then tuck that in like that. So that's in and secure. Now
[4634.30s -> 4640.90s]  secure the sides. So slide it down and tab it. Do the same thing on the other side, right?
[4642.46s -> 4675.29s]  This happened here. Tab it. All right. Same thing on this side. Slide it in. Get that
[4675.29s -> 4689.26s]  tab in there. Beautiful. Accomplishments. We're making them. We're making them.
[4689.26s -> 4693.18s]  Now before we make sure that the whole flap is still neatly tucked into place.
[4693.18s -> 4702.44s]  It is. That's, that's good to go. Close that other side. And are these corners tucked into
[4702.44s -> 4716.82s]  place too? Yes. Yes, they are. Is this slot still a neat rectangle? Yeah. I think so.
[4720.79s -> 4723.99s]  Now stand up our goggles. Here's a little tip you want to remember.
[4726.07s -> 4737.98s]  Why is there water on this? It's not okay. Freaked out. Master hand. What is it? Do you
[4737.98s -> 4762.63s]  see this symbol on the top right? Yes. Try giving it a little tap. Okay. Is this supposed
[4762.63s -> 4771.32s]  to do something? I don't think that does anything. I think, I think I'm just doing
[4771.32s -> 4778.25s]  that for no reason. The VR goggles are complete. You guys get, you guys get the
[4778.25s -> 4782.01s]  fuck in there. Hope you know that. We're going to, you're getting the fuck in here.
[4784.30s -> 4789.22s]  You can experience VR for the first time. That's the bulk of the work done. Nice job. All
[4789.22s -> 4795.82s]  I need to know is build an important little accessory, which is what? Three to four. You
[4795.82s -> 4800.54s]  mean three more pieces. Make it a safety cap. Oh great. Do I need this? What if I just don't
[4800.54s -> 4808.81s]  build this? Who cares? Remove this one piece from A. Like what if I just don't give a shit
[4808.81s -> 4830.34s]  about safety right here? Just that one? That's it? That's it, right? Punch this out.
[4831.30s -> 4841.22s]  Safety cap. I wonder what this is for. I wonder. That's that. Punch this shit out.
[4841.86s -> 4854.55s]  Push this side. These are both out, right? Yep. All right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[4855.43s -> 4859.59s]  It's going to be a hell of a vacuum job in here later. All right. That's good. Move
[4859.59s -> 4863.19s]  this out of the way. I don't think I need these anymore, but I'll put it here and
[4863.19s -> 4870.95s]  definitely need this. Don't want to lose this one. I am stuffing my legs underneath this
[4870.95s -> 4876.44s]  table right now because I have to put this all the way down. I need a different chair.
[4877.00s -> 4891.32s]  I need a specific Nintendo Labo seat. Put on real pants. These are J. Crew shorts. They're
[4891.32s -> 4897.74s]  very nice and they were extraordinarily expensive. They were more than like 80 bucks.
[4898.46s -> 4902.06s]  These are fantastic pants. They can do anything. They can go anywhere.
[4902.06s -> 4913.40s]  You can wear these wherever the fuck you want. It's all made up. None of that was real.
[4914.36s -> 4919.98s]  God, these are fucking Walmart. They were on the clearance rack for like four bucks.
[4921.83s -> 4930.30s]  All right. Let's go. J. Crew CEO in the chat. I'm getting wine, love. That's how you know
[4930.30s -> 4933.66s]  it's really starting to kick off here. All right. Time to put together the safety cap.
[4933.66s -> 4937.42s]  This accessory will make sure the console doesn't fall out while you're in the...
[4937.42s -> 4941.50s]  Okay. I wasn't going to make this. Oh yeah. Who cares your shit? I don't need
[4941.50s -> 4952.76s]  a safety cap. I thought it meant like my safety. All right. Rich streamer.
[4956.42s -> 4962.41s]  Like that. I'm going to take this outside and just try to like
[4962.41s -> 4966.41s]  burn something. I'm going to like burn some grass. Just like I'm going to take
[4966.41s -> 4970.41s]  one blade of grass to see what I can do. Don't do that at home. Don't do that because
[4970.41s -> 4982.98s]  I said to do it. Fold this. Do I have to start putting a disclaimer on every stream
[4982.98s -> 4989.69s]  that says just don't listen to a word I say. Jerma lied about Ace Attorney. Thank you for
[4989.69s -> 4995.70s]  the 10 community subs. Jerma lied about Ace Attorney. That's 10 subs. Thank you so much
[4995.70s -> 4999.62s]  for the 10 subs. I didn't lie about Ace Attorney. I told you the truth actually.
[5000.76s -> 5010.30s]  I told you the truth about Ace Attorney. How is that a lie? I said that's not a lie. Oh my
[5010.30s -> 5016.34s]  God. Somebody asked me about what happened to Ace Attorney and I very truthfully, very
[5016.34s -> 5022.31s]  transparently told them and everybody like three times. Ace Attorney is not I don't even
[5022.31s -> 5029.08s]  know why am I explaining this a third time. Ace Attorney is a series that I did not think
[5029.08s -> 5032.84s]  I thought it was a different kind of game. And I said I was going to play it off stream
[5032.84s -> 5037.48s]  and see if I wanted to stream it and then we'll see. But I kind of hung it up a
[5037.48s -> 5042.28s]  little bit though. It's not happening. So that's not lying. That's me telling the
[5042.28s -> 5050.10s]  truth. That's just the truth. That's me telling you a truthful statement. A lie would be I'm going
[5050.10s -> 5053.86s]  to play Ace Attorney tomorrow and I don't play Ace Attorney at all. And you say where's Ace
[5053.86s -> 5065.54s]  Attorney? And I go I didn't say I was going to play Ace Attorney. That's a lie. The text
[5065.54s -> 5072.79s]  game Resident Sleeper. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing. Guys,
[5072.79s -> 5077.43s]  I don't know what I'm doing any day. Okay. If you think I got a plan. I plan out very
[5077.43s -> 5084.49s]  specific stream. But like drink wine and play Labo. Kind of just happened like six days ago.
[5084.49s -> 5088.65s]  It's like oh yeah let's just do that. We'll do that on like fucking Saturday. I don't even
[5088.65s -> 5093.45s]  think I got a plan. The dunk tank is a plan. That's going to happen. That takes a while.
[5094.49s -> 5097.05s]  Day-to-day basis. I don't even know what fucking I'm eating for breakfast.
[5098.01s -> 5104.31s]  All right. All these are done. And then we're going to fold the whole thing up.
[5104.31s -> 5127.61s]  So like this. Connect this and this. Weird man. This is weird. Really. Don't embarrass
[5127.61s -> 5131.56s]  me here. Come on. Get in there. Don't embarrass me. Don't embarrass me please.
[5132.28s -> 5136.22s]  Come on. They make fun of me every time I stream. Don't let them make fun of this.
[5136.22s -> 5141.40s]  Come on. Jerma you're bad at that game. Jerma you suck. I died again. Come on. Don't let
[5141.40s -> 5147.93s]  them do this. Come on. Come on. They make fun of me every time I play a game. Not this
[5147.93s -> 5169.67s]  time. Thank god. Pointing and laughing at you this time. That's not what you said.
[5171.02s -> 5177.70s]  Pointing and laughing at you this time. I don't know where that came from. This time.
[5182.28s -> 5185.24s]  All right. Safety cap's done. Let's practice putting on the safety cap.
[5186.04s -> 5201.94s]  So the safety cap just slides down on top of here. Like that. All right. My mom has
[5201.94s -> 5217.14s]  a shirt like that. Okay. What? Anything else? Is there anything else I need to know?
[5217.70s -> 5237.11s]  My mom has a shirt like that. Okay. It's a purple shirt. The whole website you're on
[5237.11s -> 5252.47s]  right now is a purple t-shirt. Okay. Don't think it. Don't be fooled. It looks great.
[5254.89s -> 5262.79s]  Take the safety cap off. And put it over there for now. Okay. Looks good.
[5262.79s -> 5266.39s]  When you're playing with the VR goggles alone, always make sure to put the safety cap on.
[5268.44s -> 5271.74s]  Okay. Goggles and safety cap are ready. There's one more. What's the last piece here?
[5272.38s -> 5277.98s]  We're going to add the console and the Joy-Con. Oh, this is where we're going to get to play.
[5278.54s -> 5285.22s]  Oh my god. I'm fucking, I cannot wait. You won't be able to use TV mode for this part.
[5285.22s -> 5290.54s]  Take the console out of the dock. All right. Hold on. This cannot be played in TV mode.
[5291.67s -> 5309.54s]  Let me experience it first. Hold on. So you, I'm going to do it first and then you guys
[5309.54s -> 5316.17s]  can do it after. This is going to be fucking awesome. How do you capture without the dock?
[5316.17s -> 5323.69s]  I point it into the lens over there and I walk around with you guys. That's hot.
[5323.69s -> 5327.46s]  That's the only way. All right. Let me, hold on. I got to put the screen on so I don't
[5327.46s -> 5353.42s]  fucking embarrass myself somehow. All right. Hold on. Is that here? Okay. All right. So
[5354.38s -> 5362.71s]  without further ado. Never mind. All right. So then how does this work?
[5365.06s -> 5373.19s]  So now make sure you have the both Joy-Cons. Sorry. Hold on. I'll get this back on here.
[5373.19s -> 5379.11s]  Camera. Okay. Sorry. Just wanted to make sure nobody could say anything bad about me.
[5379.11s -> 5386.10s]  All right. So here I have the left and the right controller. Let's turn the volume up
[5386.10s -> 5392.73s]  so you can at least hear it. Maybe it's just a song. So who cares? All right.
[5393.61s -> 5399.54s]  I think I have to attach these. The time has come to remove the final seal. Done, done,
[5399.54s -> 5407.66s]  done. Oh, I'm taking up. I'm taking this off. Okay. Go ahead. Peel off the film.
[5418.17s -> 5429.86s]  Yeah. Wow. Whoa. That's weird. That's really weird. That's strange. I can't even describe
[5429.86s -> 5438.09s]  what that looks like. All right. That's off. I'll let you guys see it in a minute.
[5439.24s -> 5446.94s]  It's my turn with the VR. Okay. Let's fill in on how to hold the VR goggles while using them.
[5451.67s -> 5455.19s]  Always grip them firmly with both hands like this and of course you'll want to make sure
[5455.19s -> 5463.00s]  you're holding them the right way. Okay. Finally let's practice looking through the
[5463.00s -> 5472.02s]  VR goggles. I don't need to practice that. Okay. Let's slip it in there. Let's try it.
[5472.02s -> 5478.34s]  Come on. And with that we can finally say the VR goggles are ready to roll. Let's go.
[5479.61s -> 5494.04s]  Whole new virtual world awaits. All right. Let's get it in there. I get to do it first.
[5494.60s -> 5503.98s]  Okay. Here we go. Wow. That's so cool. All right. Hold on. Let me move this.
[5504.86s -> 5514.12s]  I gotta pick something. Hold on. I gotta pick. This actually hurts my head.
[5515.46s -> 5523.40s]  All right. What do you guys think? Dinosaur Safari sounds fucking awesome to me.
[5526.71s -> 5538.20s]  There's Mario Brothers. Mario Paint. I think Dinosaur Safari. Put on the safety. All right.
[5538.20s -> 5546.25s]  Safety goggles are on. Dinosaur Adventure. Okay. Are you guys good? I'm going to do it first.
[5552.71s -> 5560.71s]  What the fuck? Holy shit. What the fuck? That's a T-Rex. Oh my god.
[5563.58s -> 5572.97s]  That's a doctor. Oh my god. This is more realistic than Vive. Whoa. Oh my god. He's
[5572.97s -> 5583.70s]  right here. He's literally right in front of me. Hey. You guys gotta see this shit. Seriously.
[5589.29s -> 5598.52s]  Wow. No, no, no, no, no. Drive. Drive the car. Drive, drive, drive.
[5599.16s -> 5604.82s]  Drive the car. Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive. He's behind us.
[5608.31s -> 5635.53s]  Whoa. Holy fuck. Now this is Stegosaurus. Stegosaurus and then the T-Rex. This is
[5635.53s -> 5656.70s]  called Fight of the Century. Jesus. He's so cute. Who's that? It's hard to tell. I can't see.
[5657.66s -> 5659.18s]  There we go. No, no. I was blurred out for a little bit.
[5667.45s -> 5681.54s]  All right. How about that? I had to quit on. I got disconnected. Oh, wait. Oh, what's this one?
[5682.18s -> 5691.88s]  This is called Dino Adventure. They have like at least two or three dinosaur related games.
[5692.68s -> 5711.51s]  This is so cool. This is a good person here. Oh, I can see it. It's up there.
[5712.55s -> 5729.11s]  That's a Pterodactyl. Oh my god. The Pterodactyl is huge. Who's that? Oh, it's a Triceratops.
[5730.15s -> 5735.90s]  I didn't know they eat it. I didn't know they eat plants. Holy fuck. That's amazing.
[5737.02s -> 5757.96s]  I thought that they ate meat. You guys getting this? Watch the turtle.
[5784.86s -> 5793.50s]  I'm not going to. I'm not going to put on like the turtles having sex. I mean, I was going to
[5793.50s -> 5799.18s]  fucking be in there and watch like the turtles having sex thing. But like, come on. I'd like to
[5799.18s -> 5820.14s]  keep my Twitch TV channel. All right. So here's the real question though. Don't make me. Hold on.
[5820.78s -> 5830.98s]  What is it? What's it called? What is it actually called? It's called like life,
[5830.98s -> 5837.99s]  life source or something. Life scenes. What was the actual name of the television show?
[5839.78s -> 5860.10s]  I'm not going to type into Google turtle sex. Are you out of your mind? This might be worth
[5860.10s -> 5883.94s]  doing it. I need to like be able to hear it. In nature, it's rare to form such a life long.
[5890.70s -> 5894.70s]  What's this called? This is called nature. Oh, a nature documentary.
[5899.64s -> 5912.34s]  List of circling. Oh, turtles. Before she accepts his advances.
[5914.25s -> 5919.61s]  Oh, wow. Is there a whale over there? Can you guys see the fishes?
[5921.85s -> 5928.33s]  Their first breath together is the beginning of several hours of mating.
[5929.93s -> 5934.01s]  Several hours. Oh, well, I don't have to hold on as tight as he can
[5934.01s -> 5944.98s]  to keep her all to himself. Interesting. Unfortunately, they have company.
[5944.98s -> 5951.30s]  What's that? Another male. What's another thing he can to separate the pair and mate
[5951.30s -> 5955.06s]  with the female himself. There he goes. He's he's coming up to the behind the other guy.
[5957.06s -> 5959.78s]  What? That's the soft vulnerable parts.
[5968.57s -> 5971.77s]  He's punching him in the head. He's like punching him in the face over and over again.
[5972.57s -> 5981.14s]  Out of his rival.
[5983.46s -> 5994.49s]  Wait, what? What's going on over here? The female is struggling now with the extra weight on her
[5994.49s -> 6000.89s]  back. She will need to surface to take a breath. There's a turtle over here. There's
[6000.89s -> 6009.48s]  two more turtles that way. Another male. He's over here. What's he doing?
[6017.27s -> 6025.11s]  This is fucking crazy. More competition. What? There's like three. Whoa. And here's another.
[6028.42s -> 6031.54s]  All right, I don't want to. I want to get out. I want to get back to Super Mario Brothers.
[6032.50s -> 6038.74s]  Out. I want to get out. I want to get out. I don't want to see this anymore. This is like
[6038.74s -> 6043.06s]  three that fight each other. Now the female has they're like fighting each other locked on
[6043.06s -> 6072.01s]  her back and it's twice as hard for her. Now we're done with that bit. It's over. He wasn't
[6072.01s -> 6077.37s]  wearing the safety cap. I'm just imagining like if somebody was actually in VR and like just
[6077.37s -> 6085.86s]  watching that. It's like I say that. I say that. But aren't there like specific VR apps
[6086.58s -> 6096.50s]  where you just like watch people? Like oh I'm just gonna sit here and just like stare at
[6096.50s -> 6110.36s]  people. That's so weird. Like I don't know. Like I can't. VR porn. No man like that's too
[6110.36s -> 6114.52s]  fucking much. I don't know. That's too weird for me. And I'll tell you a couple of reasons why.
[6114.52s -> 6118.36s]  Listen to me. This is important. Story time. This is not a story. This is not like it
[6118.36s -> 6125.00s]  really happened. But just listen. If you're 18 plus conversation coming up here. Okay so
[6125.00s -> 6128.92s]  if you're not like you're not of the age fucking 18 then close. Just get out of here.
[6128.92s -> 6139.45s]  Leave. Just leave. Come back in like 20 minutes. If you have a VR helmet on your head and you're
[6139.45s -> 6145.77s]  going to watch pornography and you're going to have the VR helmet headphones and your hands
[6145.77s -> 6153.56s]  out here with like the controllers and you're gonna be like you know you'd better be alone
[6153.56s -> 6160.81s]  in the fucking house. Better be. You better live alone or you better be certain that your
[6160.81s -> 6168.50s]  roommates or your parents are not going to come home. That scares the absolute shit out of me.
[6168.50s -> 6174.10s]  And I mean I don't I haven't done that in VR. I haven't. All right let's move on from that.
[6176.81s -> 6184.70s]  That's too scary. What if like you're just sitting there enjoying adult material and you're
[6184.70s -> 6187.50s]  locked. I've been locked in. I've had people come in this room and I didn't even know they
[6187.50s -> 6192.66s]  were here. Imagine how fucking awful that would be and the embarrassment that would entail.
[6193.22s -> 6198.02s]  If you did not know somebody opened the door and there is no like whoa hey man knock once knock
[6198.02s -> 6201.78s]  for once in your life. No no no no no you're just immersed. You don't even know that they're
[6201.78s -> 6213.06s]  there. They could walk in and you're just whoa. Okay I would never in a million years
[6213.06s -> 6219.94s]  in a million fucking years. Never. If you're gonna do that and you're gonna enjoy adult
[6219.94s -> 6226.68s]  material and you're like you know an adult you're an adult. Before you before you start
[6226.68s -> 6232.12s]  just go peek outside and make sure there's no cars in the driveway. Please for your own sake.
[6239.80s -> 6253.10s]  I'm just saying. Anyways let's see what's in here. I don't think I was supposed to put it
[6253.10s -> 6264.34s]  in yet. And I don't know have like a security camera pointed at that because okay if you're
[6265.06s -> 6270.76s]  if you're in if you're doing something in particular that certain thing in particular
[6270.76s -> 6276.10s]  we're not going to name anything. This could be anything. If you're in the headset you're
[6276.10s -> 6280.52s]  in VR you're fucking sitting in your chair. I don't even know where the hell you'd be.
[6280.52s -> 6287.96s]  You need to be you need to be able to get out quick. How do you why does that even exist?
[6289.16s -> 6296.90s]  How is that even possible? You get you gotta have if you're gonna do that not only check
[6296.90s -> 6301.94s]  that there's no cars in the driveway you're gonna get a nest cam and every like six minutes
[6302.58s -> 6314.66s]  like have it pointed at the driveway like okay nobody here no okay you can't lock your door
[6314.66s -> 6317.30s]  either because if you lock your door people are gonna be like what's he doing what are they
[6317.30s -> 6338.63s]  doing in there? You lock your door it's even worse. Why did that bring it into the bathroom?
[6343.19s -> 6347.67s]  Hey what are you doing man? You're bringing your whole computer into the bathroom.
[6348.31s -> 6356.18s]  Yeah yeah yeah. But why is that? I didn't do my taxes yet. I'm gonna do my test
[6356.18s -> 6360.90s]  and I'm gonna be in there for like two hours. Oh you do your taxes in the bathroom? Yeah
[6360.90s -> 6364.90s]  yeah I do my taxes in the bathroom and now I'm gonna take a shower too. I'm gonna
[6365.86s -> 6387.00s]  I'm gonna be in the shower too. Jesus Christ look at this. I used to do that. Guys okay not not
[6387.00s -> 6393.29s]  just no no no anytime I wanted to hide something in the I was doing in the bathroom I would turn
[6393.29s -> 6399.85s]  the shower on and turn on the like the water too for like 10 but no no listen listen listen
[6400.41s -> 6408.12s]  it was only for like no no no not wasting water listen to me I would turn it on so
[6408.12s -> 6414.55s]  people thought I was going in the shower but I was really I was going to the bathroom I was like
[6414.55s -> 6418.63s]  actually going to the bathroom and people I don't know I don't know but it's like when you know

[6424.58s -> 6431.29s]  the bathroom I'm like taking a shit so like I'm just going to the shower and then you
[6431.29s -> 6435.29s]  would go to the bathroom as fast as you can like in eight seconds and then like turn the
[6435.29s -> 6460.71s]  shower off oh you guys gotta see this let me do it first for real this works weirdly enough
[6465.26s -> 6468.78s]  line up the cursor and tap I wish you get you know we're gonna do this together

[7479.45s -> 7490.73s]  close to you a good bopping yep these two come up and flip it around well those are hard
[7490.81s -> 7512.55s]  these are really really tight not bad could be better did we get community subs trin trin art

[7545.27s -> 7551.42s]  folds so then wait this has to go back and around the other side too
[7552.22s -> 7580.07s]  wait what why is mine not the same color oh no it's all right the whole thing goes across
[7584.94s -> 7591.34s]  is he okay it's the same thing i'm fine is he okay i see that okay often when i look over
[7591.34s -> 7598.38s]  the chat i'll look over and somebody be like no is he okay yeah i'm doing great are you

[7621.67s -> 7624.71s]  that's what you're talking about that's exactly what you're referring to i know that because
[7624.71s -> 7630.73s]  i did that like two weeks ago i just wanted to make sure i could prove that that was not real
[7636.02s -> 7644.84s]  see hey is he okay all right i need to pay attention stop talking about my
[7645.48s -> 7663.50s]  penis and puking you have anything else to talk about leave me alone this comes across like this
[7666.17s -> 7674.30s]  that's tricky that's a really weird fold but no thank you so much uh to turn off for the
[7674.30s -> 7678.95s]  10 community subs always appreciated thank you so much that's incredibly generous of you
[7679.67s -> 7690.28s]  and then fold fold fold just fold them all i got it i got it the doorknob is shaking

[7724.94s -> 7734.25s]  one's done okay and then the whole thing has to come over right like this and then it's up
[7734.25s -> 7752.89s]  like that this comes up the whole thing yeah okay and this piece comes down like this into here
[7754.38s -> 7768.92s]  that right did that right yeah okay and then flip the whole thing over and then this comes up
[7771.74s -> 7779.82s]  so elaborate down and in and this is the core this is the core of gun piece
[7780.54s -> 7791.96s]  so that's in and that looks good let's that looks perfect right the holder for the joycon
[7791.96s -> 7800.54s]  r is done work with this piece next it'll be the blaster make satisfying sounds pretty
[7800.54s -> 7808.15s]  wanted that as well wear pants next time you know you can't tell me what i can and cannot do
[7809.43s -> 7821.16s]  if i want to wear bike shorts no like i don't think i can do that yeah you see lots of
[7821.16s -> 7829.66s]  creases everywhere the whole thing right stop flexing i'm not flexing on camera i did it
[7829.66s -> 7836.65s]  once for a lol moment okay it's literally every single crease start at the top here
[7842.38s -> 7864.57s]  damn people are laughing i don't know why but they are laughing oh there you go there's like
[7864.57s -> 7872.65s]  there's like haha number 40 not very many more to get to 100 come on guys we can do it if we
[7872.65s -> 7887.30s]  put our power together we can do that right every little tab looks good i got them all
[7888.36s -> 7895.82s]  okay put all that boop into good use and start building fold piece up long thin box
[7895.82s -> 7905.96s]  so this comes up this i'm assuming wraps all the way around yeah uh yeah it comes across and
[7905.96s -> 7923.50s]  this probably goes down into here damn it it's tight fold this in and then that piece slides
[7923.50s -> 7936.31s]  over okay next part it just makes a little cylinder okay that's easy enough there there
[7936.31s -> 7947.90s]  you go now where does that go just get a job at a box factory and stream it that's not
[7947.90s -> 7957.30s]  the same i keep pulling the table further and further in here and it's going to be out a box
[7957.30s -> 7965.99s]  what does it what does that mean box factory two full lines crease both the lines and then
[7965.99s -> 7983.50s]  it's going to come okay up one two all right and this goes like that the tabs on each end of
[7983.50s -> 7990.52s]  the cookie will fit nicely into the slots fold the cookie up like so what the cookie
[7991.08s -> 8002.89s]  all right so this goes in like that it's the same on both sides right stick it in both tabs in
[8003.85s -> 8016.94s]  that's it on that side clicked beautiful jerma give us your end game review we don't talk about

[9355.30s -> 9367.22s]  okay yep look at how this is turning out to be something really really weird look at this
[9367.94s -> 9378.49s]  that's weird huh that's wild that's weird weird stuff weird wild stuff okay this goes
[9378.49s -> 9396.52s]  this goes down okay so then what how does it slips in so this is kind of needs to be bent
[9396.52s -> 9401.08s]  a little more because this goes in here like that and then these tabs come out and go in
[9401.08s -> 9403.38s]  in this
[9414.98s -> 9427.45s]  right am i doing that right oh shit this is gonna be oh okay so what is the tab that i
[9427.45s -> 9442.38s]  fucked it up i didn't stick that tab in i'm so angry right now you can't even begin to
[9442.38s -> 9452.46s]  understand my rage what's the point of even having the tabs on here i don't get it maybe
[9452.46s -> 9461.98s]  one day i will he's mad because bad say it again mad because bad mad because bad
[9462.54s -> 9471.50s]  and then this part flips over this way this tab goes down and the koala bear comes forth
[9471.50s -> 9486.18s]  no shit all right so then this comes over here this goes up like that and through here
[9489.43s -> 9496.44s]  this controller mark should be up it is and then this will slide all the way in
[9497.40s -> 9503.19s]  ready insert the holder as far as it will go
[9504.39s -> 9528.60s]  oh shit no no it's tearing uh that's in that's in look at that look at all these pieces
[9528.60s -> 9534.14s]  coming together this is gonna be a rocket launcher eventually eat the labo what if i
[9534.14s -> 9542.70s]  just fucking started tearing the thing apart what a waste and these ears fold in and this
[9542.78s -> 9549.61s]  thing all the whole thing goes down here's fold in and this whole thing goes down here
[9549.61s -> 9560.26s]  like that holy shit that's cool nice you'll want to do an important check here if you
[9560.26s -> 9563.70s]  pull on the end of the holder does it move a little bit without coming free
[9567.96s -> 9591.69s]  it does should that not be happening what the fuck no kind of right no it is here we go
[9591.69s -> 9597.70s]  just a gentle tug don't tug too hard or the holder might pull free why is it doing that
[9606.47s -> 9613.08s]  i mean it's it's not even in there secure i'm look at how gently i'm doing this guys
[9622.15s -> 9631.21s]  that's all right it's fine put the stopper into the little gap you can see around the
[9631.21s -> 9636.90s]  bottom of the holder it's going to go on the l mark okay let's look at some folds here
[9639.37s -> 9651.13s]  fold in half and then fold this one over and the tab beautiful little thing folds in half
[9651.13s -> 9661.64s]  get this little guy here doesn't have opposable thumbs yes i do i'm a human ah this i see this
[9661.64s -> 9686.84s]  keeps it in place here wait what so this this is the right way right all the way all the way
[9687.48s -> 9700.33s]  that's in there that's in there correctly and the other side too right oh this folds down
[9700.33s -> 9715.05s]  and into the little tab this thing is intricate for being looks pretty good did i get black

[10127.08s -> 10147.61s]  thing sorry it's power never mind even the little ones in the little frayed ones all right
[10147.61s -> 10153.94s]  but let me ask you this right so like uh you know i'm an influencer you know i'm a dot com
[10153.94s -> 10160.89s]  millennial influencer how many of you guys be honest with me here if you don't what am i
[10160.89s -> 10164.25s]  what am i doing what the fuck are you doing dumb stupid idiot no one should listen to a
[10164.25s -> 10168.49s]  goddamn thing i ever say so i'm an influencer you know i tell you things and you and you
[10168.49s -> 10186.30s]  listen to me um has anybody bought a labo because they've watched it on stream that's a
[10186.30s -> 10192.70s]  lot of nose but what if i ever what okay so if somebody comes up with hey man like we want
[10192.70s -> 10198.86s]  to sponsor your channel any analytics you can give us yeah yeah i'm mr nintendo labo
[10200.28s -> 10203.56s]  i haven't sold any copies i sold three copies of the nintendo labo
[10204.73s -> 10211.37s]  really yeah yeah yeah like four oh okay how many viewers do you have i don't know like
[10211.37s -> 10223.72s]  four thousand we'll call you back we'll call you back man thanks thanks for calling okay
[10227.06s -> 10234.09s]  all right what's next i bought wine i sell more bottles of wine than i do the video game
[10237.08s -> 10247.72s]  all right rubber bands small we need one of the smaller ones oh viewers are dropping fast
[10248.92s -> 10253.16s]  it's all right it's always yeah having a lot of viewers is cool
[10254.74s -> 10258.42s]  but it's all right you know it's not about the viewers not how many viewers you have
[10259.06s -> 10262.98s]  it's about how many units you can push a nintendo labo and then tell somebody that comes
[10262.98s -> 10266.66s]  you at like a twitch party how many units you sold and then maybe they'll give you like like
[10266.66s -> 10280.79s]  30 grand to do it again that's you know that's what matters so this goes in here all the way
[10281.59s -> 10288.66s]  will that fit in there got a box of wine cooking wine sponsorship no no one ever
[10288.66s -> 10292.26s]  sponsored me it just doesn't happen no one ever sponsored me i'm too much of a rebel
[10292.26s -> 10299.30s]  is a rubber band safely in the notches it should look yeah it is it is right yeah that's
[10299.30s -> 10315.62s]  in there uh it's time to attach the piece the rest of the core i'm no sir like i'll be real i'm
[10315.62s -> 10319.30s]  one of those people that will accept like i never have but if i accept a sponsorship let's
[10319.30s -> 10322.26s]  say it's for like a certain drink for like a wine company or something oh you should get
[10322.26s -> 10326.02s]  sponsored by a wine company oh that'd be funny but i'm the type of fucking asshole like
[10326.02s -> 10332.42s]  weirdo where if i will take a sip of it and go oh that's gross and just be kidding around
[10332.42s -> 10338.90s]  and then they'll cut the contract of half so i did this never gonna happen i turn the
[10338.90s -> 10346.38s]  core piece over so let me make sure both pieces facing the same direction okay like this
[10351.78s -> 10363.00s]  somebody say same yeah same oh they said save okay why am i holding the joy con
[10363.72s -> 10375.27s]  because i have to fast forward this is intricate i have to go forward that goes all the way in
[10375.27s -> 10391.05s]  here like this that like a little ship kind of lift the cover piece up and slide it on
[10391.05s -> 10395.70s]  check that your work to make sure everything lines up like it should i mean that's what's
[10395.70s -> 10400.10s]  snapping into place though that's kind of just sitting here is it supposed to just sit there
[10405.35s -> 10408.87s]  this doesn't feel like it's all this is not right why is this just flopping around
[10409.83s -> 10415.38s]  like it maybe it's just supposed to be like that yes and then the sides go in
[10416.26s -> 10434.02s]  okay put it around like that i'm gonna put the brightness up a little bit you guys can't see
[10434.02s -> 10461.90s]  i'm gonna put the brightness up that's better it's getting a little darker better you guys
[10461.90s -> 10474.17s]  can like actually see better right actually yeah i mean just like make it a little bit brighter so
[10474.17s -> 10483.29s]  you can see what's going on all right so what's next the rubber band now has to come up remove
[10483.29s -> 10490.73s]  your makeup all right now that's it make sure the rubber band doesn't hasn't come out from
[10490.73s -> 10499.43s]  the under the tabs no it's still there still in there right that's it there's the core the
[10499.43s -> 10503.91s]  whole core is done why does this feel frame rating on the other camera what is up with
[10503.91s -> 10550.22s]  this bullshit this is frame rating for what better that's better worse that's better is it
[10550.22s -> 10578.38s]  washed out how bright is this this is as bright as it can go watch out that's bright right
[10578.38s -> 10591.21s]  that looks good i think that's good you got to see my knee oh heavens to betsy we saw his knee
[10591.21s -> 10605.03s]  all right now this can go in here we're getting the scan lines though what the
[10605.03s -> 10621.50s]  fuck cameras suck all right that's gonna have to do one last check let's try inserting the
[10621.50s -> 10626.34s]  joy con that's the one with the plus button yeah i know what it is so this goes in here like
[10626.34s -> 10641.50s]  that like that so that goes in and this is going to be a little like right something like that
[10641.50s -> 10654.57s]  right why did somebody give me a minus two i just made a sound it doesn't well i'm not
[10654.57s -> 10668.94s]  making a joke everything doesn't be a joke i can't get it out now what is it what does
[10668.94s -> 10676.66s]  it say in the instructions about not being able to remove it from the thing i actually
[10676.74s -> 10697.43s]  i really can't get this out no what the fuck come on i can't get it out it's in there for good
[10703.02s -> 10706.54s]  cut it out i'm not gonna cut it out i just i don't know why it's in there so tight
[10709.37s -> 10713.93s]  they usually don't come out like this it's not this hard to get them out this is so
[10713.93s -> 10721.51s]  deeply in there it's unbelievable you can hear that right like that shouldn't be doing that
[10721.51s -> 10741.83s]  i seriously don't get it i don't know what it's stuck on jesus don't break it all right
[10741.83s -> 10764.92s]  that's it that's it i did it there's a tab on the bottom like that reference to the taco
[10764.92s -> 10768.92s]  belt thing you said that you got a big order and it was completely wrong you complained
[10768.92s -> 10781.94s]  and the manager just broke down crying what the hell are you talking about this didn't happen
[10782.50s -> 10792.78s]  this did this is something that you made this up what are you what they got my order wrong
[10792.78s -> 10798.41s]  and i complained and the manager cried that is a made-up story this did not happen
[10798.89s -> 10807.54s]  that was my cousin well you can tell your cousin i'm sorry to hear that but it wasn't me
[10808.44s -> 10810.52s]  all right now i'm making the actual rocket launcher 2
[10811.48s -> 10815.72s]  i can probably move this core out of the way let's check this and let's do a wine check
[10815.72s -> 10834.30s]  here i didn't do anything this is d d is right here throw it you guys want yeah it's so so

[11571.46s -> 11589.67s]  better jesus all right finally finally all right what are we doing next auto plus king's landing
[11589.67s -> 11603.70s]  it's gonna fall on me let's go tenfold you guys can ride all you want i'm not going to
[11603.70s -> 11609.86s]  go wake my dog up and put him in front of a camera that would be a bad pet owner he's to be
[11609.86s -> 11614.26s]  relaxed and hanging out and doing what he wants to do i'm not going to force him to do something
[11614.26s -> 11618.34s]  i'm not going to just pick him up and stuff him in a camera pick him up and stuff him in the
[11618.34s -> 11630.50s]  camera no not gonna happen sorry good owner no i'm not gonna why would i do that he's just
[11630.50s -> 11637.08s]  relaxing why would i want to just go disrupt his day he's just being a dog somewhere you
[11637.08s -> 11643.10s]  know no get up and i want you to come out for content get over here quick
[11643.98s -> 11650.73s]  oh he's fine just look up a picture of just type in auto germa and you'll get a good picture
[11651.29s -> 11655.14s]  you know what he looks like same thing with the other one right i'm assuming
[11655.78s -> 11672.94s]  pull the whole thing in half maybe looks like this is coming across all the way around
[11674.14s -> 11688.71s]  that goes into there that go get midas i'm not going to take my roommate's dog out of his
[11688.71s -> 11703.03s]  room to show on camera you guys have lost your minds there it is arrows pointing the right
[11703.03s -> 11710.25s]  way take a moment to check that none of the teeth have gotten folded it doesn't look like
[11710.25s -> 11719.02s]  it right teeth look like they're straight up now we're going to work with this pot what are
[11719.02s -> 11724.57s]  we doing with this pot already got it in the right spot and though i don't spin it
[11726.81s -> 11737.77s]  i'm gonna smash this whole desk i almost just did no dog on stream we need a dog
[11740.30s -> 11744.65s]  you don't need a dog you're fine listen you don't need a dog you don't know what
[11744.65s -> 11749.85s]  responsibility wise it's really hard work you gotta feed it you're gonna take it outside you
[11749.85s -> 11754.09s]  have to take care of it you don't know what it's worth you don't know what it's like
[11764.25s -> 11770.14s]  minus 100 bits that actually looks kind of funny all right uh crease crease crease crease
[11770.78s -> 11786.68s]  crease of all am i a dog no i would have been like a bee or something in a past life
[11787.32s -> 11797.58s]  i would have been like a honeybee like an ant dude in my past life i was definitely a
[11797.58s -> 11803.82s]  cheetah no you weren't you were probably like a bug statistically speaking you were a bug
[11804.46s -> 11815.18s]  i think in my past life i was probably a cat or a wolf no no you're a beetle or one of the
[11815.18s -> 11823.06s]  one of the five trillion different ant colonies in the world let's just be realistic about it
[11823.06s -> 11834.06s]  right all right this closes i'm assuming right i mean it's not cool to think about that
[11834.06s -> 11839.42s]  it's really cool to be a jaguar you weren't a jaguar in your past life unless you hit
[11839.42s -> 11853.72s]  the lottery there we go this folds into here so this goes up like that make sure they're
[11853.72s -> 11861.83s]  facing the right direction pay careful attention to these semi-circles these semi okay so yeah i
[11861.83s -> 11871.83s]  got it the right way right yeah that's correct so face it this way and then stick it through
[11871.83s -> 11877.27s]  here i'm assuming through here let me see if i'm right no i'm not right through the middle
[11879.13s -> 11894.41s]  weirdly enough this just goes in the middle like this that dude what dude all the way
[11895.80s -> 11905.14s]  insert the hexagon into the opening like this it might be a tight fit i mean it's not even going
[11905.14s -> 11910.90s]  in it's not going in what do i do i don't know i don't know what to do it's not going in what
[11910.90s -> 11928.95s]  do i do seriously man like just get in there i mean it's kind of in there kind of not really
[11928.95s -> 11937.18s]  though it's like all fucked up is that what it's supposed to look like no it goes all
[11937.18s -> 11947.51s]  the way in what this is a really tight fit i'm gonna feel like i'm gonna break it
[11961.62s -> 11970.63s]  all the way huh the teeth i did it it's i mean it's there it's all the way through oh
[11979.22s -> 11987.35s]  uh-oh that's not good that really isn't good am i going to actually break a labo for the
[11987.35s -> 11996.63s]  first time i'm supposed to be a labo streamer no it's okay not great but not okay that's
[11996.63s -> 12016.18s]  okay all right close it up that and then this comes across and in close it close it
[12016.74s -> 12022.60s]  close it same thing on this side this is the i guess this is the first part of the cannon
[12024.47s -> 12029.19s]  dude i'm gonna display this this is going right next to king's landing
[12029.75s -> 12035.02s]  as you didn't think i fucking was capable of doing that sponsored labo streamer nope
[12036.74s -> 12043.91s]  nintendo's gonna sponsor this channel drinking alcohol on stream they wouldn't want this they
[12043.91s -> 12057.34s]  wouldn't allow that it would be a huge problem that's good i think that's the whole thing
[12057.34s -> 12067.11s]  right and then the tab goes down and sticks in the corner here it's a little notch there
[12068.07s -> 12080.98s]  it's in there now okay it's in now what the last thing to do for this piece is to talk the
[12080.98s -> 12086.22s]  flap the little tooth should slot right into the opening okay there's no there's not
[12086.22s -> 12105.82s]  any music what did i do he already did i miss big bits where i didn't there's no big bits
[12105.82s -> 12118.12s]  what are you talking about germa stocks are soaring i'd i'd get in if i were you all right
[12118.12s -> 12130.17s]  remove these three sheets c and e i heard analysts were talking about this stream in particular
[12130.89s -> 12136.50s]  was going to be the most booming streams of 2019 and 2020 there's a twitch.tv analyst told
[12136.50s -> 12144.44s]  me that well it didn't tell me that i saw it e and c so this huge piece is coming out
[12144.52s -> 12157.08s]  let's see let's see one of these old ones here this one here insider trading
[12157.80s -> 12164.36s]  and analysts told me that they said new stream is pretty cool i was like nice thanks for that
[12164.36s -> 12178.52s]  man dude how many people even own germa such a such a hidden gem and then you wake up tomorrow
[12178.52s -> 12185.48s]  when it's fucking down 85 percent you were like but but you like drank on stream and
[12185.48s -> 12193.72s]  i talked a bunch of shit about nintendo and talked about how unsponsorable he is
[12195.30s -> 12210.97s]  and bad of a streamer he is oh fuck oh no how did i not see this coming and then i like
[12211.53s -> 12216.33s]  i think make my way over to the bank and take out the fucking atm deposit you know what i'm
[12216.33s -> 12249.77s]  saying is done what i lose that popped up big you're actually in a huge downward trend
[12249.77s -> 12258.31s]  right now in your stocks i just took a week off though does that matter what doesn't matter
[12258.31s -> 12274.17s]  whatever dow stocks twitch stocks who cares twitch stocks your stocks are down i mean are
[12274.17s -> 12291.05s]  they though so i put a call option out on tesla a few weeks ago sure about that are
[12291.05s -> 12306.92s]  you sure about that i'm talking about my stocks stop flexing i did not do that i'm just pretending
[12306.92s -> 12326.68s]  to call options on tesla lol i know you say that now but if you had done that a week ago
[12327.80s -> 12341.27s]  talking stocks here you know i know what i know about stocks investment advice from twitch chat
[12341.83s -> 12345.59s]  didn't somebody have a twitch account with twitch chat like told them what to buy for
[12345.59s -> 12364.82s]  stocks and all that that's so funny that's such a fun idea so we got this sounds like an easy
[12364.82s -> 12370.02s]  way to lose money i don't know i don't know how well or how bad that uh channel's account
[12370.02s -> 12376.18s]  did i know that they he was doing it somebody was doing it it's a really fun idea really cool
[12376.18s -> 12384.34s]  piece of content all right um so what we got punch it all up a full okay i need a big space
[12387.46s -> 12401.99s]  show auto labo is a resident sleeper every labo that comes out i have to do
[12402.87s -> 12419.40s]  i signed a contract with myself no one else was involved labo streamer i fucking hear it in my
[12419.40s -> 12425.75s]  sleep that's a fold all so this has to be like this all right i gotta get this out of the way
[12431.64s -> 12438.60s]  germa is his own demon lick the cartridge oh man that sounds kind of fun i've had a few
[12438.68s -> 12444.14s]  drinks man that sounds like a fun idea maybe i'll do it he's not gonna do it
[12444.70s -> 12458.86s]  let's fold this tab out do it do it link what do you mean link tab up
[12486.90s -> 12494.60s]  this one how many more of this one too so many creases and folds and doodads and
[12495.24s -> 12512.28s]  noodles and qrst uv this two fold lines here is there no it's not oh there is shit
[12519.06s -> 12527.06s]  what a fucking disaster you know i woke up the next day and i was so embarrassed i was like
[12527.06s -> 12532.82s]  what the fuck happened i knew what happened but i'm never gonna live that one down
[12532.82s -> 12549.22s]  it's impossible i need this back here top five streams if you say so
[12549.94s -> 12557.26s]  so this one goes across between the holes down here right yeah two holes
[12558.06s -> 12561.16s]  i think i don't know i don't know i don't know i hope it's right
[12569.56s -> 12575.30s]  it's kind of a weird place for a sticker to five streams
[12575.94s -> 12585.83s]  to top up i missed it somebody said the top five streams that was the wrong place no it wasn't
[12586.55s -> 12598.44s]  no that's correct is it yeah no it is that's right so only one
[12599.24s -> 12610.95s]  i just got here and you're already drunk i i am i'm not but thanks for asking okay uh
[12611.83s -> 12614.65s]  firmly with both hands all right the whole thing has to come up in half
[12615.61s -> 12627.75s]  somebody said kappa you never see kappa anymore this is a tough one kappa really fell out of favor
[12627.75s -> 12644.78s]  didn't it people now do like omega lol no people don't do it anymore 100 000 bits damn
[12644.78s -> 12662.73s]  thanks man it's a lot that pulls the crease there omega b w l b w l jerma how do i get

[12784.65s -> 12804.23s]  i tried all right so let's keep going bale grim uh john wade's an interesting impression
[12804.23s -> 12808.23s]  because if you can't do john wane you just sound awful trying to do john wane
[12808.23s -> 12811.75s]  and if you can do john wane you sound great there's really no in between
[12812.63s -> 12819.03s]  you sound terrible and really bad and not good at all if you try to do it if you can do it
[12820.18s -> 12831.75s]  you sound great what's the worst possible voice you can do like most grating i don't know i
[12831.75s -> 12848.33s]  don't think i have anything like that i'm gonna get this last one i mean maybe like
[12848.33s -> 12854.39s]  air coming out of a horn maybe like an air horn that is barely running out of air
[12854.39s -> 12872.70s]  might be close that's that's as close as i could probably get something like that probably
[12879.67s -> 12898.73s]  kim is sleeping okay no more of that uh shit all right i'm being quiet this is look at how
[12898.73s -> 12909.03s]  hard this one is look at this do you understand how fucking impossible this one is look at this
[12909.03s -> 12927.70s]  shit how are you supposed to do this wow god damn doesn't want to do it that wine's not
[12927.70s -> 12940.04s]  going to spill i got a good eye on it god damn all right that's all of them right one two three
[12940.04s -> 12947.67s]  four yep so this is going to be the uh the blaster portion right take care of these triangle
[12947.67s -> 12963.38s]  teeth huh fold them up so tiny can we get a sweat check yeah what's that oh we're good
[12963.94s -> 12974.34s]  we're we are completely clean didn't expect that did you you did not expect that neither did i
[12975.22s -> 12995.78s]  all right now this is it's down here so this piece goes where the hell does this go
[12999.16s -> 13006.52s]  many important bits come together to make a space station after all this is a gun flip it over
[13007.16s -> 13021.29s]  fold it all up every little crease okay i got it we got bits what are you talking about
[13021.29s -> 13038.30s]  what's that he got you again well it's really easy to get you it's not that difficult to
[13038.30s -> 13050.17s]  get you he's hungry for bits wait bitch see a bit how much how many this one's actually
[13050.17s -> 13056.09s]  not that bad i didn't like it at first it's too fruity it was like really sweet and sugary but
[13056.09s -> 13067.14s]  it's it's growing on me a little bit this is uh cooper cooper and thief for those of you
[13067.14s -> 13076.39s]  that want to pretend this is a sponsored stream go ahead and pretend i did all that
[13077.11s -> 13098.41s]  oh shit uh we need eyelet we need one of these and one of the washers washer and
[13099.13s -> 13110.41s]  eye something that's going to go through there oh shit do you see the tracks go this way
[13111.37s -> 13143.62s]  and then oh shit that and then this on top of that like this snap that piece on ready to go
[13147.90s -> 13159.32s]  sit in there kind of all right snapped in like that step three is fold the whole thing over
[13160.76s -> 13169.53s]  weird okay so this what is this for oh must be an ammo box of course i have no idea what that
[13169.53s -> 13177.72s]  is how do you skip forward to its completion well it's pretty easy you go to bed so go
[13177.72s -> 13182.60s]  to sleep right now when you wake up in the morning come back to germany85twitch.tv
[13183.40s -> 13190.04s]  and open this content and skip forward like four and a half hours from right now you just have to
[13190.04s -> 13201.98s]  go to sleep and then just and wake up you'll be able to get it that's the only way minus 120
[13201.98s -> 13209.90s]  thousand bits for being a poop with head thanks all right that was fast now it's time for this
[13209.90s -> 13220.90s]  piece why does this fit my face so perfectly this was made for my chin and face to go in
[13221.46s -> 13249.77s]  is my chin really that skinny what well so let's fold everything from this side up
[13261.34s -> 13269.46s]  someone measure it measure my chin what is that going to do here come all the follow lines do it
[13269.46s -> 13281.02s]  all okay this one a compact chin kind of have a big chin it's skinny but it's long
[13283.83s -> 13292.18s]  i've got a long skinny chin it's all right though i don't that don't mind it i think it was okay
[13292.90s -> 13297.88s]  you know as long as you're okay with the way you look who gives a fuck what anybody else has
[13297.88s -> 13318.33s]  to say you know what i mean all right folded everybody says you are handsome though who
[13318.33s -> 13322.01s]  cares what everybody has to say you know what i mean like people people can be mean and
[13322.01s -> 13326.17s]  oh you're handsome people can be cruel you look great today yeah you know don't worry
[13326.17s -> 13333.03s]  what will people have to say about you you know it's not a big deal where's this going
[13345.19s -> 13350.23s]  again flipping around what i keep flipping it around oh oh shit this is going to go over here
[13350.23s -> 13362.68s]  huh where line up the control panel what what in the name of god is this doing i need two
[13362.68s -> 13384.98s]  grommets i'm not sure if this stream sucks or not it sucks pretty bad if you're new to
[13384.98s -> 13395.40s]  the channel we do every labo every single one every labo is done on this stream so if you don't
[13395.40s -> 13420.76s]  like it there's a door right there you probably have one too that means everybody leave no that
[13420.76s -> 13426.04s]  means if you like it stay if you don't then i'll see you soon you don't have to love the
[13426.04s -> 13446.20s]  labo streams i do and that's all that matters right it's not like that jerma i'm outside
[13446.20s -> 13453.85s]  well what are you doing still on twitch oh shit he's hemorrhaging viewers who cares

[13530.71s -> 13553.94s]  i was pretending to lick it jesus christ man this stream sucks hey don't say that about my stream
[13555.14s -> 13567.40s]  i work real hard on these where did it go it's right there no don't yes i'm wearing two
[13567.40s -> 13575.08s]  different socks and you have to fucking deal with it all right work real hard on this shit
[13575.64s -> 13593.90s]  all right what do i need to do so it goes underneath it goes like under here this
[13594.54s -> 13605.70s]  lines up like that okay all right then it goes through thanks for catching that by the way
[13605.70s -> 13616.98s]  somebody caught that i would have been miserable if i didn't know look we do whatever on this
[13616.98s -> 13625.14s]  string look have you figured that out yet some of you some of you long-time subscribers
[13625.14s -> 13632.82s]  are still like wait what's he doing today we do whatever though we want come on man

[13653.99s -> 13665.90s]  near future oh god we're getting real intricate here okay so then this moves here and then
[13667.75s -> 13682.95s]  this comes over now what does this go this all right that's really weird remember the
[13682.95s -> 13689.59s]  corbit it actually goes inside the lss2 go ahead and get it ready check the direction
[13690.15s -> 13694.55s]  of the eyelet house if the side where you insert the tab is on the inside then you're all good to
[13694.55s -> 13706.44s]  go it is slide the core along until it comes to rest against the eyelet's house what the fuck
[13706.44s -> 13717.42s]  okay so like this what's a bourbon wine i have no idea kind of tastes good though the rubber
[13717.42s -> 13723.54s]  band hasn't been come loose check quickly to make sure and fix it no it's not oh dear we
[13723.62s -> 13728.98s]  have to fold the whole thing around this like a sandwich i don't look like a piece of sushi
[13733.18s -> 13766.66s]  roll up the sides around the whole thing this goodness this goes under here and go like that
[13766.66s -> 13775.34s]  i'm not supposed to close this up like this there it is there it is there it is there it
[13776.06s -> 13789.66s]  will go back this comes up first slide it there this comes up all the way like that
[13791.34s -> 13807.26s]  and then this side comes up here which leaves this here like that okay and this closes down
[13807.26s -> 13824.25s]  there oh my god all right so how do i connect this together hold them in one place until we
[13824.25s -> 13838.90s]  can secure them see this little flap over here flap yeah fold it up it'll help keep everything in
[13838.90s -> 13846.84s]  place for now really well i just hold it that really did work okay it actually worked
[13847.40s -> 13852.89s]  and then the rubber band comes up and goes over and around the whole thing
[13855.80s -> 13879.59s]  that's it this up and around i think that's good looks like it's all right i don't know
[13883.35s -> 13893.53s]  yeah no it's in there and then we fold this shit up we'll fold up the control pan on x
[13893.53s -> 13906.26s]  first raise up the skinny arms my god this is elaborate and then bring them connect the arms
[13906.26s -> 13926.36s]  by sliding the notch so i'm connecting these like that yeah once that's done lift up the sides
[13929.82s -> 13940.74s]  this holy shit this is crazy it comes up and this folds down and this comes across here
[13941.94s -> 13951.70s]  this is looking like a rocket launcher that's for sure so we have to do more building on
[13951.70s -> 13965.85s]  that then that's over here get this where does this go rubber band should be on the
[13965.85s -> 13972.17s]  other side of the tab isn't it though looks like it is that's not on the other side looks like
[13972.17s -> 13981.75s]  it is that's in the right spot right this thing looks cool yeah lavos are cool they really are
[13984.14s -> 13990.90s]  tabs here it's cool to see it come together regardless of how the game is it's cool to
[13990.90s -> 13998.76s]  make a little device that's cool to make a king's landing it's in front it goes in the front
[14002.55s -> 14016.84s]  all right i got it i got it thank you everybody for giving me the tips that i need that's in the
[14016.84s -> 14023.80s]  front that's good to go right in front so then what does this do it's probably this next bit
[14023.80s -> 14032.57s]  might surprise you lift up the whole thing and align it like so was the arrow arrow
[14033.21s -> 14044.92s]  and it goes in the mark on the end should be the line it is like that and then it goes down
[14052.07s -> 14075.86s]  all the way in god come on come on and oh i see look at that here's the tube this is cool
[14076.89s -> 14086.79s]  nice all right let's stick it up here these tabs go back inside weirdly enough they kind
[14086.79s -> 14095.40s]  of fold back in on themselves this is one and the other one's on this other side
[14095.40s -> 14114.49s]  i can't really get it though there we go done cool now what pull it to the right when you
[14114.49s -> 14134.39s]  let go does it snap back into place that's pretty cool so it's like total shock huh
[14136.66s -> 14153.56s]  how they think of this shit i have no idea the lss is ready for launch all right next part
[14153.56s -> 14157.00s]  well that's the second step complete the front of the toy is now all done why not take a break
[14157.80s -> 14172.38s]  i don't think i need a break making the clacker so we need c and f c and f where's the home
[14172.38s -> 14181.75s]  stretch maybe like another hour and a half maybe like another two hours we need this thing in
[14181.75s -> 14200.65s]  the middle what is a clacker what does that mean clacker let's see do an auto break no
[14200.65s -> 14205.21s]  we're good we're good we're good i want to get this done because once this is done and i play with
[14205.21s -> 14210.97s]  it for five seconds we'll just hang out in the chat for a little while another glass of wine
[14210.97s -> 14219.50s]  we'll go on our merry way you know all right looks good i'm going to move this out of the
[14219.50s -> 14229.16s]  way because i don't think i need it right this second all right a little spaceship here
[14229.16s -> 14246.36s]  let's punch out the necessary things needs to be like that hang out jupiter yeah we'll just
[14246.36s -> 14251.61s]  hang out for a while because i don't have the other they don't sell them together they're all

[14260.52s -> 14266.86s]  shit you have to buy this on the nintendo official website shop it's not on amazon
[14266.86s -> 14272.36s]  either you can't get the whole kit on amazon right now it's all uh locked out you could
[14272.36s -> 14278.33s]  spend like 110 bucks to get it from some third party but i apparently bought it too late
[14279.05s -> 14293.62s]  but i should end up doing that take that sheet of marker stickers this thing okay
[14297.85s -> 14307.59s]  bend the sheet no i can see it i can see it just fine so the stickers on this part of the
[14307.59s -> 14313.61s]  sheet it's the right in the middle all right i see you can't see but i can that's all the
[14313.61s -> 14328.57s]  matters is that i can see so right here i'm trying to see so hard it's the wrong piece
[14329.53s -> 14347.35s]  i can't see help i'm gonna do some punching you know i need i need like a little pen to just go
[14347.35s -> 14362.81s]  like it's so much easier than my finger it's a little too late now though use your teeth no
[14362.81s -> 14382.22s]  i can't bite into this shit it'd be bad news come here come here okay so now right here
[14382.22s -> 14391.21s]  needs to be this big sticker right here the big one large one the biggest one on the sheet
[14391.21s -> 14405.14s]  don't pull them all off that goes right on top of it like this right oh no come on it sticks so
[14405.14s -> 14420.90s]  much good good i was going to lick the cartridge yet yeah i did against my better judgment yes i
[14420.90s -> 14454.65s]  did i fold it all it was on accident though to be fair fold it okay every little piece
[14454.65s -> 14487.46s]  needs to be turned oh nintendo fold fold fold it crease it again crease fold fold fold fold go
[14487.46s -> 14511.10s]  go go how did you look at accidentally with prior judgment because i pretended to lick it
[14511.10s -> 14516.06s]  but i went too far i pretended to lick it for the joke and my tongue touched it
[14516.94s -> 14531.67s]  unfortunately it's the truth it went too far not good with depth perception have you seen me
[14532.39s -> 14540.20s]  slap myself in the face before i have done that this folds in these ones go out
[14541.16s -> 14546.12s]  out and out and these come in all the way does it push it does it do the whole thing
[14546.76s -> 14555.16s]  like this i think so lick the table no i'm sorry that's not gonna happen that actually
[14555.16s -> 14562.47s]  will not happen there's like jokey lick the cartridge and then there is embarrassing

[17224.71s -> 17238.54s]  somebody like starting their car because they're going to work i think we're all
[17238.54s -> 17255.03s]  folded it's just a fan all right a fan you're just scared of getting a job

[17285.50s -> 17304.52s]  connect that bottom part oh this is a weird piece okay like that how long was that
[17304.52s -> 17320.38s]  rumor part of the stream i can't tell i can't see from here hefty amount like 20 minutes
[17320.94s -> 17327.37s]  ah i'm sorry spent longer time one more dumb shit it's okay as long as it wasn't like 40
[17328.17s -> 17338.52s]  it's an interesting looking piece this folds all the way and really really i don't believe
[17338.52s -> 17359.85s]  you i don't wait what hold this down this comes down and then this comes up roll it over
[17362.95s -> 17372.01s]  jesus all right this these two come down i'm getting sleepy stop being so boring
[17372.73s -> 17381.78s]  i was just screaming for like 10 straight minutes i was just i was just making loud
[17381.78s -> 17395.16s]  fucking noises for like 15 straight minutes i was screaming and yelling loud equals funny
[17395.16s -> 17400.02s]  no i wasn't trying to be funny i was trying to make a point it's all right i can't win
[17400.74s -> 17427.78s]  can't win what's next loud equals i'm right got it no that was the culmination of like six
[17427.78s -> 17435.38s]  months of being roomed on and off stream no loud doesn't equal right loud is not funny
[17436.02s -> 17450.76s]  damn it don't think of me like that actually think of everyone what is this what this is
[17450.76s -> 17458.84s]  a tight piece what are the squares on my door uh they are noise dampening devices
[17461.77s -> 17468.50s]  it is noise foam makes it so there's no echo in the room as you notice when i go like hey hey
[17468.58s -> 17474.60s]  hey hey hey uh there's no echo there's a bunch of panels over here there's a couple of bass
[17474.60s -> 17484.95s]  traps in the corners a couple of bass traps in the what's gonna say sink closet it dampens
[17484.95s -> 17489.59s]  the sound in the room so without a bunch of furniture you cannot have a bunch of echo
[17493.24s -> 17497.64s]  don't resident sleeper come on it's what it's it's easy nine ten eleven it's like 12 a.m of
[17497.64s -> 17503.22s]  course you're gonna resident sleeper it's time for bed in like 10 minutes but i'm not
[17503.22s -> 17517.34s]  stopping the stream that's it right looks good that little piece here all right next is this big
[17517.34s -> 17525.11s]  one got a tab here i'm going to bed in a few yeah do you think you know do do whatever you
[17525.11s -> 17532.18s]  want do do you think hope you have a good rest have a great sleep hope you have the best
[17532.18s -> 17538.01s]  dreams possible define good have a good i don't know have a good restful six to eight
[17538.01s -> 17546.36s]  hours of sleep i'll give a good restful like eight hours of sleep you wake up refreshed and
[17546.36s -> 17553.69s]  ready to take on the world you know unless you've been drinking wine all night in that case and
[17553.69s -> 17572.94s]  sleep in a little hold all this stuff 13 hours maybe you've been up to 13 hours or
[17573.82s -> 17590.07s]  it's not that long tell a bedtime story um i don't really have a bedtime story you're
[17590.07s -> 17602.62s]  better off just kind of making one up yourself 13 hours stream i don't that's not gonna happen
[17603.26s -> 17613.54s]  this has been about five hours feels a lot shorter than that this will be uh like seven
[17613.54s -> 17626.78s]  six to eight i'm not doing a 13 hour stream all right that's all folded good to go all right
[17626.78s -> 17641.58s]  now what what do i do with this read the whole rat movie script i i made it i don't need
[17641.58s -> 17651.86s]  to read it i already know all the lines okay this whole thing rolls up on this side thing rolls
[17651.86s -> 17667.62s]  over that and then it comes across the whole thing it snaps in give us a good night kiss
[17670.22s -> 17689.42s]  um how about a good night soft dude you know hey good night soft dude it's good
[17690.38s -> 17699.16s]  close it now if you take it off you go to bed and we'll see you again soon
[17700.06s -> 17706.04s]  thanks for coming up blaster is nearing completion it's pretty interesting it's got like a little
[17706.04s -> 17711.80s]  in the middle so that's cool and this tab folds out and what does the tab do
[17713.22s -> 17722.82s]  hidden opening and stick it in it's that simple apparently all right then this piece
[17723.46s -> 17732.73s]  which is right and left it's got a couple of lines here to fold lick us or you'll never
[17732.73s -> 17738.47s]  see us again that's not true you tell me if i don't lick the camera then you guys won't come
[17738.47s -> 17744.66s]  back i have trouble believing that so all right let's put it all together
[17746.70s -> 17759.50s]  ooh yellow two of them these are thicker than the other ones getting almost to the end of
[17759.50s -> 17774.68s]  the grommets so we're combining these two so this is r and r each bit has a hole in it
[17774.68s -> 17778.52s]  and we want to line those up first make sure that the r mark on each piece is facing
[17778.52s -> 17798.62s]  upward so all it is now r and r right so r and r like that i think i don't know
[17803.43s -> 17817.24s]  that i mean that's correct and then the yellow grommet goes in the middle here

[20107.03s -> 20110.39s]  slide the bottom of the grip between the bits of the tube we just opened up
[20115.53s -> 20119.21s]  see ah see the angled slots on either side of the hook part of the grip
[20120.18s -> 20133.02s]  lower them right down over the sticky outy bits on the tube oh jesus so this goes through

[27638.49s -> 27645.13s]  and see if i can get that actually to work am i gonna go to evo i will probably go to evo
[27645.13s -> 27650.89s]  because it's in vegas so why wouldn't i right it's kind of it's like fucking right down the
[27650.89s -> 27663.14s]  street go to evo like that shit is right down the street so why would i not go it would be
[27663.14s -> 27672.79s]  kind of it would be stupid if i didn't because it's really interesting stuff but we

[27708.71s -> 27714.92s]  250 i was thinking about tf2 again germa it's a crying shame what valves do into that game
[27715.72s -> 27723.83s]  the last good thing added was naming the scout after you uh i don't know if that's real though
[27723.83s -> 27728.95s]  i mean i think that's that might just be just be a coincidence if it's not then like i said
[27728.95s -> 27734.71s]  i've made a statement about it before that's incredibly fucking wonderful that i could even
[27734.71s -> 27741.29s]  imagine anyone would ever do that it's probably just a coincidence but that community is
[27743.78s -> 27750.57s]  unfucking believable so uh but what are you gonna say the last good thing added was
[27750.57s -> 27754.57s]  naming the scout after you i know everyone compares you to the scout but what class is
[27754.57s -> 27760.22s]  your favorite in terms of personality regardless of gameplay the spy i got tf2 after seeing your
[27760.22s -> 27765.82s]  fat guy enji vid it's the first vid i saw of yours garf's been a fan for over four years

[27772.98s -> 27781.27s]  phil lord is in it garf goo i don't think i want to be in shrek 2 uh the spy is my
[27781.27s -> 27785.59s]  favorite character in that game just personality wise i think he's really fun and interesting
[27786.22s -> 27796.79s]  and who who couldn't love the heavy the heavy is just a lovable amazing character so uh but
[27796.79s -> 27807.38s]  yeah i mean that tf2 is would i be sitting here right now talking to you guys if i didn't play
[27807.38s -> 27814.73s]  team fortress and make all those videos no probably not so team fortress was a very real
[27814.73s -> 27821.75s]  start of everything i was doing so i i mean i played that game for years it was one of
[27821.75s -> 27829.06s]  it was like the biggest part of it was a huge part of my life so i owe a lot to that community
[27829.06s -> 27834.44s]  i know i owe a lot to team fortress and valve for even making the game in the first place so
[27837.29s -> 27844.95s]  i owe a lot to that community they propped me up really fucking high they did so i have
[27844.95s -> 27855.54s]  nothing but love for that community at all nothing at all but love and finally we have
