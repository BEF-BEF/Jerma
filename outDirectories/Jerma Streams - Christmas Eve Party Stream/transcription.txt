[1.14s -> 13.50s]  Well hello. Welcome to Christmas Eve, god darn it. Oh yeah, that was an ordeal. Taleks and I have been
[14.22s -> 20.54s]  painstakingly trying to get this ready for the last probably about three and a half hours.
[21.34s -> 27.34s]  We had some issues, but the issues have been fixed, I think. I hope so. And we're ready to
[27.34s -> 36.18s]  have a Christmas Eve party. Happy Christmas Eve everybody. And how the heck are ya? Hope you're
[36.18s -> 43.14s]  having a great day. Conductor drummer is on the case, as you see. I've got my costume on. I've got
[43.14s -> 48.58s]  my... I forget about the branding on that thing. I was going to cover it up before the stream
[48.58s -> 53.78s]  started, but I did it somehow. I got a nice tree. I've got my nice brick backdrop here.
[54.74s -> 61.13s]  Put on any presents under the tree here that was picked by you guys in the mods too.
[62.09s -> 67.22s]  Welcome to Christmas Eve. Yeah, sure, I started like an hour and a half late.
[68.68s -> 74.44s]  Typically, I would love to have started an hour ago, but camera broke. We had some lighting
[74.44s -> 78.68s]  issues. I had some fucking OBS issues, but you know, whatever. It's Christmas Eve. Merry
[78.68s -> 83.24s]  Christmas. Happy holidays. How are ya? So let's break down what we're going to do.
[84.57s -> 87.45s]  Over here, let's... You're probably wondering why the fuck there's a printer here.
[88.25s -> 95.21s]  This is the extreme magic fax machine. So anytime that you want to send me a message or want to
[95.21s -> 100.09s]  talk to me, you're going to use your magical fucking computer and I'll get it somehow through
[100.09s -> 107.77s]  a bit donation. Hopefully it works. I hope it's hooked up correctly because there should be
[107.77s -> 111.53s]  messages from the fucking people coming out here. And if there's not, then you know,
[111.53s -> 116.01s]  we'll have to fucking unplug and plug it back in. Presents over here, tree over here.
[116.09s -> 120.65s]  I got a train set ready to build. Oh, Jeremy, you look like a fucking dickhead.
[120.65s -> 126.41s]  Well, you know what? Sometimes you look like a dickhead. Oh my God.
[132.42s -> 139.22s]  Okay. So my fucking fly was undone in the very beginning. That's a fantastic start.
[140.26s -> 142.98s]  Why don't we move over to the train set? Because I'm in the conductor round,
[142.98s -> 146.18s]  couldn't might as well do it here. Welcome frame, everybody.
[146.18s -> 161.38s]  So I got, I can't fucking believe my fly. Did you see my fly undone? Hey,
[161.38s -> 164.34s]  you tell us. Was my fly, did you see my fly undone?
[166.50s -> 170.63s]  Was my fly actually undone? Why did you like tell me that?
[172.86s -> 177.34s]  He's fucking over there being a director. All right. So hey,
[177.34s -> 182.06s]  Choo Choo, what do you say here? We got our train set here. I figured it'd be a fun start.
[182.70s -> 186.06s]  The first part of the stream should be about building and creating.
[187.10s -> 191.54s]  So I have, this is going to be fucking ridiculous.
[194.18s -> 199.06s]  Here is the train that I have. We're going to build a train set on the frame.
[200.50s -> 205.46s]  And this is kind of going to be a present that I'm going to give to
[206.98s -> 211.43s]  probably a local library, I would assume. I'm going to probably donate this to a library
[212.07s -> 215.59s]  because what the fuck am I going to do with this after the streams over? I have no idea.
[215.59s -> 223.19s]  So let's get started here. It's called the South Pacific train. It looks like you keep and score.
[225.03s -> 228.79s]  Can you see the shit? Does this look good? So I got pieces here.
[230.39s -> 234.07s]  I got straights, I got curves, and I kind of don't know what to do.
[235.19s -> 242.20s]  I'm thinking like a figure eight. This shit, this, this moves by the way. If you're like,
[242.20s -> 246.76s]  oh, Jeremy, it doesn't move. How can it move the fucking mic?
[249.74s -> 257.48s]  Hold on. This looks getting good.
[258.94s -> 268.84s]  Good. Can you hear me? It's my fucking flyer. Jesus Christ. Okay. Hey,
[268.84s -> 271.64s]  Merry Christmas, by the way, everybody. How the heck are you?
[272.60s -> 283.70s]  So within 10 seconds of the fucking stream, my fly. All right.
[283.70s -> 288.82s]  I'm going to say if we start, because this is a real train. Like I said, it's going to move
[288.82s -> 297.18s]  in various directions. I need the plug to go in here though. The plug has to go in here.
[297.18s -> 301.42s]  This is a real fucking train, ladies and gentlemen. So we have to start.
[301.42s -> 309.32s]  I don't want to break this. This is going to a library. God damn it.
[309.32s -> 324.10s]  Just get the fuck over here. Right here. I'm going to plug it in. Am I going to get electrocuted
[324.10s -> 339.86s]  if I do this? Okay. I did not get electrocuted. Train there. Okay. So I have to start here.
[340.58s -> 349.45s]  Is that an error message? I don't know if that's an error message.
[350.65s -> 361.43s]  All right. Shut the fuck up. All right. You got to match the fucking lines up here,
[361.43s -> 372.76s]  folks. I got to get like a bird's eye view because I'm thinking straight.
[373.96s -> 378.12s]  And what a goddamn train this is. Straight and then around
[378.76s -> 387.27s]  and then maybe straight and around again. Yes, I'm aware that I look like a total
[387.27s -> 404.31s]  fucking dickhead. I'm aware. So like, here we go right here. So these trains.
[407.37s -> 412.10s]  Let me show them. I don't know why I'm so afraid of electricity right now.
[414.41s -> 422.94s]  Ah, here we go. Okay, that's in. So should I do like some tricks?
[426.63s -> 432.97s]  I'm thinking like at least two loops. Let's block it out. So if I go like that,
[433.85s -> 444.31s]  that's a huge you. But I got to make sure I can actually get off of me.
[444.31s -> 451.03s]  I got to make sure I can actually connect it. No, that can't go there.
[452.42s -> 458.58s]  I'll be amazed if this actually works. I can one loop around and then maybe straight
[458.58s -> 468.44s]  and then around again. That looks better. I hope you're enjoying your holiday here.
[477.59s -> 490.25s]  There. I got this little piece. Like, what is this for? This looks like it can go
[491.21s -> 498.73s]  across and then through this way too, right? But that's sort of figure eight.
[502.55s -> 508.42s]  Close enough. Maybe I should have wrote this down. Because right now it's going to be
[508.42s -> 521.08s]  like a loop and then another. Hold on. How can I get a loop? I don't think I can get
[521.08s -> 527.62s]  it to work because if I go like that, I guess maybe it could go around in another
[527.62s -> 549.21s]  circle and then through here. It looks like one more. Oh, that's going to look actually
[549.21s -> 577.50s]  really cool. One or will this work? That's not going to work. What if I go like
[578.38s -> 587.06s]  so through here and then this, how am I supposed to get this to go this way?
[593.35s -> 595.99s]  You know what I'm saying? Like how am I supposed to get this to go all the way around?
[596.55s -> 611.16s]  Is it even possible? This segment was supposed to be about 20 minutes. Don't think that's going
[611.16s -> 631.03s]  to be the case anymore. Get it like this. All right. I'm going to build out from here.
[631.03s -> 641.08s]  That's what I'm going to do. If I go out from here, don't worry. The train will,
[641.08s -> 646.06s]  you'll ride on the train in a second. Look at it to work. I'm going to say like this
[646.06s -> 651.50s]  and then like that. I don't care that much about how cool it looks. You know what I mean?
[651.50s -> 654.70s]  I care about it working. That's all I give a shit about.
[660.98s -> 669.27s]  So then we're going to fuck this whole thing up. Get in here. Plastic on it.
[676.94s -> 691.75s]  Don't break it. Don't break it. I'm going to break it. I don't want to. That's the problem
[691.75s -> 699.91s]  here. Get in there. Come on. Come on. I got a stream to run.
[712.17s -> 719.86s]  Somebody is probably telling me, Jeremy, you should probably put some jump in there and
[720.42s -> 724.95s]  put some obstacles in there. Yeah. I can't even get the whole thing built before that.
[725.51s -> 730.94s]  I was going to have like trees and shit to go around. Why is this going in?
[731.82s -> 747.06s]  What have I done that's wrong? All right. It's in. Got it. All right. Finally. Oh,
[747.06s -> 756.70s]  God. All right. Connect this. It's supposed to be easy assembly in my ass. Much easier
[756.70s -> 764.76s]  than the other one. All right. So here we go. Starting here, right around. This thing makes
[764.76s -> 778.65s]  noise and shit too, guys. So then let's get a straight track ahead. I'm going to lap my
[778.65s -> 786.26s]  ass off. I built this whole thing and it just doesn't work at all. I spend all the time doing
[786.26s -> 793.69s]  this and then turn it on and it just fucking sits still. Oh, get your fucking frog champs.
[793.69s -> 800.38s]  Oh, what the fuck? Ow. Seriously, that fucking hurt. This is designed for like 11 year olds.
[800.38s -> 814.70s]  How did I just hurt myself? Get in there. No, that's not in there, right? Get in there.
[815.42s -> 830.66s]  This thing's bent. How did I bend it already? Oh, you motherfucker.
[834.63s -> 844.68s]  On the side. So when I was looking at the box, this thing looks actually really fucking cool.
[846.04s -> 857.18s]  It makes noise. It has smoke that I'm not going to use. What am I doing? All right. No,
[857.18s -> 871.02s]  no, no, no, no. That's good. That's good. That's fine. Let's go this way. Yes. All right.
[871.74s -> 880.79s]  Do it again. I'll be fucking surprised. Okay. That's good. How does it look so far?
[881.51s -> 896.47s]  What are they saying? Anything bad? Hold on. He just went, he just went like this.
[897.69s -> 906.49s]  He just went like this. Well, you don't like this? You don't think this is cool?
[909.59s -> 920.44s]  I got a train set. God damn it. He just goes like this. All right. Fine. Let's build a
[920.44s -> 926.71s]  fucking train. Just wait till I turn this thing on. And that was a horrible voice crack,
[926.71s -> 935.58s]  but Dutch does it. So it's okay. Dutch made the voice crack cool again. Like made it like,
[935.58s -> 945.11s]  okay to do it. I hate it. I hated the train segment. That was the worst part of the
[945.11s -> 953.62s]  cryptocurrency stream. Like fuck that whole segment. What? He built a train on stream?
[953.62s -> 963.99s]  I hope he fucking pees his pants. Oh, don't. This is nice. Okay. Hold on. Let me tell
[963.99s -> 978.63s]  you. This is just part one of the night. Okay. So just relax around the circle and
[978.63s -> 997.42s]  then it's got to go this way. How the fuck am I going to get it to go that way? This? All
[997.42s -> 1005.94s]  right. I gotta check this out. Watch this. Ready? Bang. What if this is the whole stream?
[1005.94s -> 1013.51s]  I just baited you guys so hard. It's just me building a fucking train set in front of
[1013.51s -> 1025.59s]  fucking 40,000 people. All right. So is that going to work? Oh my God. It's not going to
[1025.59s -> 1037.80s]  work. No, this is not going to do anything. Plug it in. Let me see. So I want to see.
[1037.88s -> 1066.28s]  I just want to make sure the thing works. Okay. Here we go. Ready?
[1073.22s -> 1105.98s]  Wait. Oh, this is stupid, Jeremy. God damn it. I need to see if it goes. Whoa, whoa,
[1105.98s -> 1131.22s]  whoa, whoa. Oh yeah. Plug chip. Oh, this is bad. I need to get like a closed loop.
[1144.07s -> 1149.67s]  I can't even get it closed. I screwed the whole thing up. I mean, no, because this
[1149.67s -> 1182.44s]  has to come off. That. Oh, baby boy. He figured it out. Take a look at this shit. Oh, Jeremy,
[1182.44s -> 1185.80s]  this is the worst thing you've ever done on stream. Oh yeah. Has it? You didn't
[1185.80s -> 1201.83s]  fucking watch this part. Oh, look at that. Okay. Close. Get this connected again.
[1201.83s -> 1214.63s]  Oh man, this is going to be good. We're real good. We got starting here,
[1215.59s -> 1223.85s]  around, through, and then around. Stomp it. Stomp it. Jeremy, stomp the train. No, I'm not.
[1223.85s -> 1240.73s]  Why? Please give it a rest. Every little bit. Okay. All right. Then around this way.
[1241.69s -> 1251.75s]  Come on. Yeah, I know you can do it.
[1254.74s -> 1259.66s]  Round and then close it. And then if we can get a full loop, I'll be happy.
[1260.62s -> 1265.82s]  This thing is fucking cool. I might just be saying that because everyone's probably fucking
[1265.82s -> 1272.06s]  talking about how this is the worst thing ever. No, they're not. But I can't see. You know
[1272.06s -> 1288.20s]  what I mean? Right here. All right, that's good. As long as these things are actually
[1288.28s -> 1298.42s]  connected well. And they are. So I need to connect it here. And that's a full loop and
[1298.42s -> 1305.05s]  we're going full blast. I'm going to play the fucking noises. I'm going to play the
[1305.05s -> 1314.57s]  fucking sound effects. It's going to be so awesome. Just edit that part out, dude.
[1315.53s -> 1333.64s]  I know you're watching. Look, this is good. Some library is going to get this. A local
[1333.64s -> 1336.76s]  library. And they're going to make some cool display and it's going to be fucking awesome.
[1337.72s -> 1348.46s]  I'm just testing the goddamn thing, okay? Once you see it go around the whole track,
[1348.46s -> 1362.02s]  I think your mind will change. Good. All right. Kind of making a reverse squid.
[1362.90s -> 1368.71s]  Am I going to have enough track to do this? I don't think I have enough track
[1368.79s -> 1388.41s]  to do it. This is bad. Right there. Don't break anything.
[1395.00s -> 1405.66s]  I don't have enough pieces to complete this. Really? One, two. Oh, fucking hell. Come on,
[1405.66s -> 1426.60s]  really? How do I not have enough pieces to do this? Shit. I guess I could.
[1427.72s -> 1431.22s]  What can I do about this? I don't know. Take from here?
[1453.75s -> 1455.19s]  Let me just see what happens when I do this.
[1455.35s -> 1461.45s]  I need a complete circuit before we move on. Don't you understand? That's one
[1461.45s -> 1469.98s]  that goes up here and around and then... Shit. Let me test it. Is that good? What
[1469.98s -> 1488.17s]  happened? What happened? What? What's the fucking problem?
[1557.24s -> 1573.11s]  I think that's good enough. I think that's great. That looked really fun.
[1579.72s -> 1585.93s]  Wait, were you playing Thomas the Tank?
[1593.22s -> 1606.41s]  Are you fucking kidding me? Oh, my God. I need a complete loop. Just get this. I
[1606.41s -> 1611.13s]  fucked the whole thing up. I made a pretzel. I was supposed to make a figure eight.
[1618.90s -> 1627.96s]  I needed to go around the circle once. Just wait. Hold on. Get rid of this fucking
[1627.96s -> 1662.42s]  piece. I got it. I figured it out. Just wait. Speed run. Here we go. Watch this shit. Here
[1662.42s -> 1678.01s]  we go. Get it on there. I'm the best. I'm the greatest. Don't break this. This is going to
[1678.01s -> 1732.95s]  a library. How am I supposed to do this? Close. I just want... I need this piece.
[1732.95s -> 1735.67s]  I need the fucking piece that has power. Get out of here for a second.
[1741.85s -> 1752.23s]  Almost. Do I not understand basic physics? How the fuck am I supposed to connect this?
[1752.23s -> 1761.61s]  I just want a circle. I need like this here. Wait a minute. Hold on. I'll get it.
[1762.41s -> 1778.09s]  It's a merry fucking Christmas. Got it. Got it. Where's the electric piece right here?
[1778.09s -> 1796.97s]  I bent it. I think so. Oh, fuck. Yeah. We've got a complete loop.
[1802.38s -> 1814.14s]  Oh, baby. Would you look at that? Get it on here. Where's the plug? I just need a circle
[1818.58s -> 1830.70s]  Okay. It's on there, right? Try to do something fancy and you fuck it all up.
[1831.10s -> 1836.81s]  I think that's good. Get out of the way. I want a good view of this.
[1837.37s -> 1871.05s]  Okay. You ready for the complete loop? Here we go. Here we go.
[1901.50s -> 1907.58s]  Thanks for coming to the stream, everybody. That's it. No, you know what? Let's get on
[1907.58s -> 1912.14s]  this thing. You want to get on this train? It's a complete loop. Let's get on the
[1912.14s -> 1919.59s]  fucking train. See? Let's get on it. Let me get in. Let me get on that train.
[2088.92s -> 2095.56s]  Oh, my goodness. Oh, what's it? Oh, what's it? Oh, what's it? Oh, what's it?
[2116.78s -> 2126.42s]  Welcome. Happy Halloween, you fucking idiots. Welcome to, my magic book sometimes is a little
[2126.42s -> 2139.32s]  on the weird side. Welcome to an edition. A special holiday edition. A scary story
[2140.20s -> 2145.96s]  with me, B.F. Mugler Baron. Oh, and is it going to be a great one today? I'll tell you.
[2145.96s -> 2152.68s]  Yes, it will. I've got my fucking magic book. I wish it would stay open. That would be
[2152.68s -> 2168.65s]  fantastic. Sometimes you've got to turn off the batteries. Staying open, please.
[2169.45s -> 2173.64s]  The witches sometimes take over on their own.
[2183.30s -> 2202.38s]  Okay. So first, I have a selection of stories from my dark magic book. It'll be very,
[2202.38s -> 2210.12s]  very fond of with one of my favorites. Oh, it's Christmas time, though,
[2210.12s -> 2218.18s]  you'll be very... What kind of Christmas stories will we be getting? The first tale is called
[2218.34s -> 2231.88s]  Carol Singers. A collection of horrible fucking deeds. Carol Singers is a scary story for
[2231.88s -> 2240.65s]  Christmas about a kid whose father and grandfather go from door to door begging for money.
[2240.65s -> 2255.43s]  It is based on an old horror story by Bernard Kurtz. The vanity. You know,
[2255.43s -> 2263.18s]  my grandfather was a drunk and my father was a drunk, but I never touched drunk.
[2263.18s -> 2269.98s]  There's a reason for that. When I was young, times were hard and I grew up poor.
[2271.22s -> 2275.94s]  My grandfather and my father never did an honest day's work in their lives.
[2277.69s -> 2286.76s]  Granddad wasn't good for much, but he played the clarinet like an artist. He taught my
[2286.76s -> 2298.81s]  father how to play the accordion. This is upside down. It did cause a little bit of an issue.
[2315.19s -> 2319.90s]  They would gather a group of friends and go door to door,
[2320.70s -> 2325.10s]  playing Christmas music, singing Christmas carols and begging for money.
[2326.42s -> 2330.82s]  Afterwards, they would all go down to the pub and spend it on alcohol.
[2331.78s -> 2342.39s]  No! Don't do that! On Christmas Eve, they brought me with them. I was too young to play an instrument,
[2342.39s -> 2346.87s]  so they handed me a triangle and told me to strike it every now and then.
[2346.87s -> 2358.22s]  I was dark. The snow was falling and cold December wind cut through us like a knife.
[2358.94s -> 2367.03s]  We kept our heads down and trudged through the snow and sleet. Eventually,
[2367.03s -> 2371.27s]  my grandfather stopped and said, this looks like a pretty good place as any.
[2372.55s -> 2377.03s]  We were outside a big mansion decorated with Christmas lights.
[2379.64s -> 2388.81s]  My grandfather knocked on the front door and began to play some old Christmas carols.
[2388.81s -> 2397.72s]  The door of the house swung open and in the dim light I saw a young woman standing there.
[2398.44s -> 2401.32s]  She was holding a tray of glasses in her hand.
[2404.92s -> 2419.35s]  With a smile, she picked up a glass and held it out, inviting one of the men to drink.
[2420.81s -> 2425.05s]  My granddad rubbed his hands together with glee.
[2432.94s -> 2439.08s]  Just then I looked up and in the window above I saw a face peering up.
[2439.08s -> 2448.54s]  A face that was hideous beyond words. I looked back at the woman at the doorway
[2449.18s -> 2455.29s]  and her face was hideous too. Before I could stop her,
[2456.38s -> 2461.66s]  my grandfather put a glass to his lips and knocked it back with one big gulp.
[2463.86s -> 2470.26s]  Oh dear, said the woman in an eerie childish voice. Oh, you've drunk blood, sir.
[2470.98s -> 2484.07s]  With that, the door slammed shut. My grandfather stumbled backwards and the grass fell from his hand.
[2485.85s -> 2500.10s]  It's so sad that the deafening crash and he collapsed. I don't remember much after that.
[2501.69s -> 2507.85s]  All I recall is waking up in the lights of dawn and finding myself lying in the snow.
[2508.81s -> 2515.50s]  The other men were lying all around me, just waking up themselves.
[2516.38s -> 2519.54s]  My father got to his feet and rubbed his head.
[2521.62s -> 2525.30s]  The woman had disappeared and the house was boarded up and abandoned.
[2526.02s -> 2533.88s]  All that was left was a dark red stain in the snow with a glass that broke.
[2536.33s -> 2541.85s]  My grandfather lay there in the snow beside it, his face purple and swollen.
[2549.42s -> 2557.91s]  We hurried home that morning and called the police.
[2558.86s -> 2563.26s]  They picked up my grandfather's body and brought it to the mortuary.
[2564.06s -> 2568.78s]  My father told them what had happened, but they didn't believe a word of his tale.
[2570.10s -> 2574.50s]  They said the house had been vacant for a hundred years.
[2576.09s -> 2577.13s]  One hundred!
[2580.62s -> 2584.39s]  After that night, my father was never the same again.
[2585.03s -> 2594.63s]  He never let another drop of alcohol touch his lips and made sure I didn't die.
[2594.63s -> 2595.75s]  That is the story.
[2603.50s -> 2604.54s]  Two points!
[2604.54s -> 2611.72s]  This next tale is, say, one.
[2611.72s -> 2617.14s]  This next tale is called Vickalritha.
[2617.14s -> 2627.06s]  Those of you wondering, I didn't get my Halloween stream.
[2627.06s -> 2630.04s]  So of course I'm going to show up here.
[2631.88s -> 2639.59s]  Three months went by and get what I was supposed to get, which is a stream for Halloween.
[2641.35s -> 2642.95s]  Oh, but it's Christmas time!
[2642.95s -> 2643.99s]  It's Christmas time!
[2645.03s -> 2646.71s]  That's all I hear is that.
[2646.71s -> 2649.59s]  Vickritha.
[2649.59s -> 2653.54s]  I like this one because it has a lot of voices.
[2653.54s -> 2656.25s]  I love doing those.
[2656.25s -> 2657.67s]  They're a lot of fun.
[2658.23s -> 2665.85s]  Vickritha is a scary story about a legendary monster who lives in the icy
[2665.85s -> 2667.13s]  wastes of the North Pole.
[2668.09s -> 2672.86s]  Bah!
[2702.01s -> 2706.73s]  It was Christmas Eve and the family were gathered in the living room.
[2723.48s -> 2739.91s]  The family was gathered in the living room.
[2739.91s -> 2743.35s]  The father was reading the newspaper and the mother was knitting a sweater.
[2745.72s -> 2750.52s]  The children, Jimbo and Steffa, were stretched out on the floor with their crayons
[2750.52s -> 2751.72s]  and their coloring books.
[2753.48s -> 2756.44s]  Tell us a story, Steffa demanded.
[2757.24s -> 2762.71s]  A scary one, Jimbo insisted.
[2764.47s -> 2767.19s]  All right, all right, said their father.
[2767.99s -> 2770.87s]  I'm going to tell you about the fearsome, dangerous,
[2770.87s -> 2772.87s]  and appalling creature in the world.
[2772.87s -> 2776.12s]  It's called Vickritha.
[2776.12s -> 2781.83s]  Oh, now you've done it, said the mother.
[2782.47s -> 2785.99s]  You've said his name out loud.
[2785.99s -> 2787.88s]  Voldemort.
[2787.88s -> 2791.06s]  Where is he?
[2791.06s -> 2792.34s]  Said Jimbo.
[2792.79s -> 2794.87s]  He's the most awful thing in the world.
[2795.51s -> 2798.07s]  He lives in a cave in the North Pole.
[2798.07s -> 2802.39s]  The coldest, wettest place on earth is where Vickritha makes his home.
[2803.56s -> 2809.64s]  He sleeps in the rep of a ship that somehow got squeezed into the mouth of a cave.
[2809.64s -> 2812.92s]  He doesn't mind the cold and doesn't mind the wet.
[2813.56s -> 2816.66s]  But I think he hates the most.
[2817.30s -> 2821.93s]  Here someone say his name.
[2825.18s -> 2828.86s]  He was very good and he has very good ears.
[2829.82s -> 2837.53s]  And they get bigger every time his name is spoken anywhere on earth.
[2838.68s -> 2842.76s]  Sometimes his ears get so big he can use them to fly.
[2842.76s -> 2845.24s]  He can fly away with his ears.
[2845.24s -> 2850.60s]  I don't like this story, Steffa whined.
[2852.60s -> 2854.44s]  Play now, her mother said.
[2855.98s -> 2859.82s]  If we finish the story before he gets here, everything will be fine.
[2859.82s -> 2862.70s]  Do you know why the grither is called the grither?
[2865.93s -> 2866.65s]  Why?
[2866.65s -> 2867.45s]  Said the children.
[2868.63s -> 2874.79s]  Because he has fists as big as basketballs and his arms as long as ball constrictors.
[2875.51s -> 2878.95s]  Whenever he finds the people who have been speaking his name,
[2878.95s -> 2883.83s]  he opens up his fists, reaches out his arms and grithers them.
[2890.62s -> 2896.46s]  He squeezes them by the head and squeezes their head until it pumps.
[2898.63s -> 2899.83s]  Guess Michael Balloon.
[2900.31s -> 2904.66s]  Ah ah ah ah ah.
[2904.66s -> 2912.01s]  Give all that.
[2912.01s -> 2915.40s]  No, said his father.
[2915.40s -> 2919.96s]  He's not like Bigfoot and he's not like the abominable snowman either.
[2921.91s -> 2924.07s]  Nobody knows what he looks like for sure.
[2924.07s -> 2930.23s]  The only people who have ever seen the grither are the people the grither has eaten.
[2931.27s -> 2933.19s]  Gonna be you.
[2937.42s -> 2942.62s]  He's as tall as a tree and can bend all the way over and touch the ground.
[2944.07s -> 2947.91s]  His skin looks like a road map because it's transparent
[2947.91s -> 2951.59s]  and all the blue and red veins show through.
[2951.59s -> 2961.05s]  The blue is for the fear, the red is for the rage.
[2964.36s -> 2968.76s]  And hurry up and finish the story before he gets here, Stiffle cried.
[2971.11s -> 2993.61s]  Well, the grither was born on a sailing ship, said her father.
[2993.61s -> 2998.33s]  It was blown off course by a storm and got lost in the Arctic sea.
[2999.62s -> 3005.06s]  They drifted around for weeks and never saw anything but glaciers and icebergs.
[3006.78s -> 3010.14s]  Some of the passengers drowned, some froze to death,
[3010.14s -> 3014.38s]  some starved and the rest committed suicide.
[3014.38s -> 3020.07s]  The grither was born out of the fear and rage of all those people.
[3022.01s -> 3024.89s]  But why does he kill people, Kimball asked.
[3025.99s -> 3026.71s]  Nobody knows.
[3028.30s -> 3030.78s]  Nobody knows, said his father.
[3030.78s -> 3034.38s]  He just doesn't like anyone telling his story.
[3035.86s -> 3037.86s]  Is that all, Stiffle asked?
[3037.86s -> 3039.30s]  Is that the end of the story?
[3040.66s -> 3042.26s]  Well, not quite.
[3043.54s -> 3044.98s]  Not quite, said her father.
[3046.34s -> 3050.18s]  There's only one way to protect yourself from the grither.
[3050.18s -> 3051.22s]  Only one way.
[3055.59s -> 3058.95s]  Maybe you should stop, said the mother and interrupted.
[3060.62s -> 3064.78s]  I don't, I think, I think you've scared them enough for tonight.
[3065.42s -> 3071.99s]  You don't actually believe this story, said the father.
[3073.32s -> 3075.85s]  No, the children lied.
[3075.85s -> 3079.05s]  Well, you shouldn't because I made it all up.
[3082.01s -> 3085.21s]  I made the whole story up, said the father.
[3085.21s -> 3087.53s]  There's no such thing as the grither.
[3087.53s -> 3088.49s]  It's not real.
[3090.01s -> 3092.81s]  Oh, why didn't you finish the story, said Stiffle.
[3094.01s -> 3097.13s]  All of the sudden, the front door blew open
[3097.13s -> 3100.41s]  and the room was enveloped in an icy blast of wind.
[3100.41s -> 3103.37s]  There was a crash and the sound of breaking glass.
[3103.37s -> 3108.49s]  Then the two huge, gnarled arms reached in through the windows
[3108.49s -> 3110.89s]  and grasped their parents by the head.
[3110.89s -> 3117.21s]  As the children watched in horror, the hands squeezed
[3118.15s -> 3123.99s]  and squeezed their parents' fucking heads until they exploded.
[3169.69s -> 3171.93s]  Sometimes when a story is so good.
[3181.83s -> 3183.91s]  One of our final tales of the evening.
[3187.30s -> 3190.78s]  Could I use your printer?
[3195.70s -> 3198.42s]  This isn't printed out really the way that I want it to.
[3199.14s -> 3201.32s]  You print me out another copy.
[3201.32s -> 3202.52s]  I don't know if this is here for.
[3203.08s -> 3208.47s]  Doesn't work. Made by HP.
[3208.47s -> 3210.31s]  Are you sure I can't just, I need to,
[3210.31s -> 3212.47s]  if I could just get this printed again.
[3213.35s -> 3219.38s]  It's okay.
[3225.00s -> 3227.40s]  And just tell Jeremy that after the show,
[3230.78s -> 3232.78s]  $40 for my usual fee.
[3233.50s -> 3237.67s]  I can't use that.
[3245.19s -> 3245.99s]  Is this how it works?
[3249.40s -> 3252.20s]  Print me out another one that I have a file
[3252.20s -> 3253.88s]  or that I put on his computer.
[3254.76s -> 3258.95s]  I don't know if he has it or not.
[3261.29s -> 3267.35s]  This next tale is, I think I got it from Reddit.
[3267.35s -> 3270.36s]  A terrifying tale.
[3270.36s -> 3272.65s]  A horror tale.
[3272.65s -> 3283.72s]  A few years back, I went to my dad's house for Christmas.
[3284.95s -> 3289.27s]  My parents are divorced and I rarely go,
[3289.27s -> 3291.99s]  but my siblings put a lot of pressure on me
[3292.71s -> 3293.51s]  so I went.
[3294.81s -> 3298.01s]  It took about 15 minutes before the stress got to me.
[3302.26s -> 3304.98s]  So we all sit down to open presents.
[3304.98s -> 3307.78s]  Dad, his new wife, my sibling,
[3307.78s -> 3309.86s]  Prezian and my grandmother.
[3309.86s -> 3311.80s]  We make it around the circle,
[3311.80s -> 3314.04s]  opening presents for about two rounds
[3314.04s -> 3318.12s]  before my grandmother gets up and leaves the room.
[3319.85s -> 3321.69s]  My father starts fiddling around
[3321.69s -> 3324.09s]  waiting for my grandmother to come back
[3324.09s -> 3326.01s]  and spot something on the floor.
[3326.97s -> 3328.57s]  It appears to be cat puke.
[3331.18s -> 3337.10s]  He asks his wife if it is indeed cat puke.
[3338.74s -> 3341.78s]  She had gotten up and followed my grandmother around
[3341.78s -> 3342.82s]  and knew the truth.
[3343.94s -> 3345.38s]  It was not cat puke.
[3346.02s -> 3348.10s]  It was my grandmother's shit.
[3349.22s -> 3352.44s]  And the lady had shit all over the couch.
[3353.32s -> 3356.87s]  It doesn't take long before we can smell the shit
[3357.59s -> 3360.39s]  and no amount of air freshener was fixing that.
[3361.27s -> 3365.10s]  Grandma comes back into the room now
[3365.10s -> 3367.98s]  wearing nothing but a blanket around her lower half.
[3368.78s -> 3371.42s]  The couch is covered with plastic and towels.
[3372.22s -> 3377.45s]  My little sister is forced to sit next to my grandmother
[3377.45s -> 3380.01s]  and we are all expected to sit nicely
[3380.01s -> 3381.93s]  and open more presents
[3382.49s -> 3384.73s]  while pretending that my grandmother
[3384.73s -> 3386.73s]  had not just shit all over the couch.
[3387.29s -> 3392.95s]  Also the following day my tooth exploded.
[3393.59s -> 3396.09s]  Apparently I had an abscess,
[3396.73s -> 3399.22s]  but I never felt a thing until it exploded.
[3400.58s -> 3401.54s]  TLDR.
[3403.61s -> 3404.89s]  Grandma shit on the couch.
[3406.42s -> 3408.10s]  What a horrifying story.
[3408.66s -> 3410.18s]  What a terrifying tale.
[3410.82s -> 3428.12s]  I have one more tale.
[3431.70s -> 3436.82s]  A tale of a very recent one that came up.
[3437.62s -> 3456.36s]  The final tale is a recent tale
[3456.36s -> 3458.76s]  that I came across in my travels
[3458.76s -> 3461.32s]  and I found it to be so bone-chilling,
[3461.32s -> 3465.16s]  so absolutely disgraceful and horrible.
[3466.58s -> 3468.42s]  For warning to you all watching,
[3469.38s -> 3476.10s]  this last tale will chill you to your very soul.
[3480.46s -> 3486.98s]  This tale is called The Sins of Yesteryear.
[3507.62s -> 3509.54s]  The Sins of Yesteryear.
[3510.50s -> 3514.15s]  The winds blow cold this time of year.
[3514.95s -> 3518.39s]  The true of the snowy icy-filled days
[3518.39s -> 3520.15s]  are heartened to blame
[3520.15s -> 3522.73s]  and seeing your hot breath
[3522.73s -> 3525.45s]  turn to condensed clouds of cold silk.
[3526.09s -> 3528.81s]  Now your toes turn to numb rubbers
[3528.81s -> 3532.33s]  not under the oars,
[3532.33s -> 3534.55s]  not the sun-chilling breeze.
[3535.75s -> 3536.71s]  I would say.
[3536.71s -> 3545.83s]  The breezy before-christening job
[3545.83s -> 3547.03s]  around the neighborhood
[3547.03s -> 3550.60s]  to do track and field in high school.
[3551.96s -> 3553.72s]  And like stand active.
[3554.36s -> 3557.32s]  So I was usually running or walking everywhere.
[3558.04s -> 3560.52s]  The route I would typically lead
[3560.52s -> 3563.16s]  simply through a few side streets in the neighborhood.
[3571.64s -> 3572.92s]  Am I supposed to read these?
[3573.56s -> 3574.04s]  What is this?
[3580.58s -> 3582.18s]  When I was like 11,
[3582.18s -> 3584.42s]  I really wanted to be an iPod
[3584.42s -> 3585.30s]  for Halloween.
[3585.94s -> 3589.46s]  So my dad made me a foam rubber iPod costume
[3590.50s -> 3592.26s]  complete with speaker mounts
[3593.80s -> 3598.44s]  so I could play music while I trick or treat it.
[3602.28s -> 3605.24s]  No one wants to be an iPod anymore.
[3607.74s -> 3609.42s]  Oh, how dastardly.
[3610.38s -> 3619.80s]  I don't retake.
[3625.61s -> 3626.81s]  Ah, scary.
[3626.81s -> 3632.74s]  Let me go back to what I was saying.
[3632.74s -> 3645.85s]  That was a little humorous, I will say.
[3647.93s -> 3650.73s]  On a breezy before Christmas day,
[3650.73s -> 3653.21s]  you know the story was cold
[3653.21s -> 3654.57s]  and he got jogging.
[3654.57s -> 3655.93s]  He's a jogger.
[3655.93s -> 3657.21s]  He likes to run.
[3657.21s -> 3658.81s]  He likes to move around.
[3660.81s -> 3661.45s]  Okay, sorry.
[3666.49s -> 3669.05s]  I'm a major creature of habit.
[3669.05s -> 3673.88s]  Some very odd reason.
[3678.23s -> 3682.41s]  I strayed away from my normal routine
[3683.37s -> 3688.55s]  and it will haunt me until my final day.
[3689.75s -> 3693.83s]  I had always heard stories about this person
[3693.83s -> 3695.51s]  called the loud man.
[3696.71s -> 3699.27s]  It was an urban legend in our city
[3699.27s -> 3702.55s]  and the story is told differently from person to person.
[3703.27s -> 3706.87s]  It became a sort of running joke among all of us.
[3707.83s -> 3713.40s]  Loud laughing, noises, and sometimes faint screams
[3714.36s -> 3715.96s]  coming from a certain house
[3717.32s -> 3720.46s]  which is what made it so strange.
[3721.66s -> 3724.94s]  What were these noises and who was making them?
[3726.76s -> 3729.64s]  I was never afraid of urban legends
[3729.64s -> 3732.84s]  and always scoffed at the idea of a boogeyman
[3732.84s -> 3735.40s]  or a bigfoot among us
[3735.40s -> 3737.48s]  who were hiding in plain sight
[3737.48s -> 3740.76s]  waiting for the right time to drain us of our souls.
[3742.65s -> 3745.05s]  Oh no, he took me away to another dimension.
[3746.01s -> 3747.37s]  I didn't believe any of it.
[3749.30s -> 3753.30s]  The idea seems silly until the loud man.
[3755.22s -> 3758.90s]  You see, sometimes I take quick breaks during a job.
[3760.50s -> 3763.88s]  I check my pulse, make sure my shoes are tied,
[3763.88s -> 3765.88s]  nice and tight, catch my breath.
[3765.88s -> 3766.92s]  You know, do this thing,
[3767.64s -> 3770.04s]  do this thing, or whatever the fuck that is.
[3772.18s -> 3774.50s]  As I reach down to tighten my shoes
[3775.62s -> 3777.14s]  is when I heard the sound.
[3778.10s -> 3786.10s]  Quick, loud, distinguished, a swift thunk, a thunk.
[3786.90s -> 3789.16s]  The feeling was immediate.
[3789.96s -> 3794.22s]  Breaking bone, bending cold.
[3794.22s -> 3797.58s]  I thought possibly it may have been a reaction from the jog.
[3797.58s -> 3799.42s]  Was I moving too fast?
[3799.42s -> 3801.42s]  Did I push myself too hard?
[3802.46s -> 3803.34s]  No way.
[3804.06s -> 3806.70s]  It felt as if something entered my body
[3806.70s -> 3808.78s]  and froze it to its very core.
[3809.58s -> 3813.34s]  I went to one knee and let the chill dissipate.
[3813.98s -> 3816.22s]  The sky opened up at that moment
[3816.22s -> 3819.10s]  and for the first time in nearly a decade
[3820.70s -> 3823.58s]  rain started to fall in December.
[3825.00s -> 3828.20s]  I quickly brought myself up and checked my surroundings,
[3828.20s -> 3831.56s]  my body still aching from the frost in my chest.
[3831.56s -> 3834.12s]  Finding the rain back as I tried to move,
[3834.68s -> 3837.08s]  each step more deliberate than the last.
[3838.22s -> 3841.90s]  Finally, in the pouring rain, I spotted a figure.
[3843.56s -> 3848.04s]  A figure exiting from the loud man's house.
[3851.54s -> 3853.54s]  This was just a urban legend.
[3854.34s -> 3858.10s]  No one had ever seen anyone come out of that house
[3858.10s -> 3859.38s]  or near that house.
[3859.38s -> 3861.38s]  It was supposed to be abandoned.
[3862.10s -> 3872.10s]  And then a hunch over small, rail man emerged through the dark.
[3878.34s -> 3880.50s]  It was hard to make out through the rain,
[3880.50s -> 3885.30s]  but he was dragging something or possibly someone.
[3888.55s -> 3892.39s]  The faint jingle of bells could be heard
[3892.39s -> 3899.19s]  with each pull of the oversized sack and the gurgling awful grunts
[3899.19s -> 3901.27s]  coming from the loud man's mouth
[3901.27s -> 3905.19s]  sounded like they were grating through the very gates of hell.
[3908.01s -> 3912.49s]  I felt I had to do something, but I was frozen in place.
[3914.17s -> 3916.49s]  A statue of a man did I turn into.
[3916.49s -> 3917.37s]  Should I run?
[3917.37s -> 3918.41s]  Should I walk?
[3918.41s -> 3919.29s]  Should I scream?
[3920.01s -> 3921.53s]  Nothing seemed normal.
[3921.53s -> 3922.97s]  Everything seemed out of place.
[3924.17s -> 3926.49s]  What felt like an eternity had passed.
[3926.49s -> 3927.69s]  I needed to make a move.
[3928.57s -> 3939.64s]  I put one foot in front of the other and slowly.
[3955.86s -> 3958.66s]  Just checking in to make sure your printer works now.
[3959.62s -> 3962.82s]  We are watching the stream and saw you had difficulties.
[3963.78s -> 3966.98s]  Thanks for installing our easy print software.
[3967.78s -> 3970.26s]  Thanks to our monitoring agreement,
[3970.26s -> 3973.30s]  we will be able to fix it remotely from our end.
[3974.26s -> 3977.54s]  Thank you, Jerma985, for choosing DeskJet.
[3980.68s -> 4000.26s]  Fine, that helped me.
[4000.26s -> 4001.30s]  I don't know.
[4001.30s -> 4009.62s]  The loud man stopped dead in his tracks
[4009.78s -> 4014.92s]  as I put one foot in front of the other.
[4014.92s -> 4017.00s]  He stopped and dropped his bag.
[4019.08s -> 4022.60s]  His crooked head ripped sideways,
[4022.60s -> 4025.24s]  tilting over 180 degrees in a second.
[4025.24s -> 4031.24s]  His eyes lit up red like blood with piercing light skewing through my very being.
[4033.45s -> 4037.13s]  His jaws started to unhinge
[4038.01s -> 4042.33s]  and his mouth opened nearly a foot across.
[4043.21s -> 4051.16s]  The most unnerving sound I will ever hear.
[4059.06s -> 4060.18s]  I bolted away.
[4061.14s -> 4064.10s]  Far out matching any competition I had ever been in.
[4064.10s -> 4065.78s]  Street to street, sign to sign.
[4066.82s -> 4068.50s]  I ran as far as I could.
[4068.50s -> 4070.02s]  I ran within ten minutes.
[4070.90s -> 4074.02s]  Here in the distant worlds of the loud man's cries,
[4074.02s -> 4076.90s]  I ran until the rain dissipated
[4078.42s -> 4079.94s]  and the clouds let up
[4080.90s -> 4087.18s]  and the world seemed at unease.
[4088.06s -> 4101.05s]  It was very quickly I heard the news.
[4103.05s -> 4105.13s]  Santa had disappeared.
[4107.53s -> 4111.29s]  It was on every radio station, every TV channel.
[4111.29s -> 4114.33s]  You couldn't pass a group of people on the street
[4114.33s -> 4117.93s]  without some form of conversation playing out
[4118.25s -> 4120.97s]  about the recent event of his disappearance.
[4123.85s -> 4124.81s]  Oh, why?
[4126.89s -> 4128.81s]  That was one year ago today.
[4131.00s -> 4132.84s]  No one believed my tale.
[4134.15s -> 4137.85s]  I was seen as a liar, a fraud.
[4141.06s -> 4143.30s]  The debate rang out across the globe
[4144.02s -> 4148.90s]  on whether or not Santa was even actually real or not.
[4149.86s -> 4151.54s]  Nations in conflict.
[4152.18s -> 4156.18s]  Twitter ablaze with confrontations.
[4160.52s -> 4164.60s]  And to this day, we're still not so sure.
[4167.50s -> 4169.90s]  I've tried to live a normal life
[4171.18s -> 4173.26s]  questioning my own sanity
[4175.99s -> 4178.71s]  and the reality each passing month.
[4179.51s -> 4181.75s]  But hear me now.
[4182.71s -> 4185.94s]  I still feel those eyes.
[4186.90s -> 4191.06s]  I still see those shark-fanged teeth.
[4191.78s -> 4193.62s]  I still hear his scream
[4193.62s -> 4196.98s]  and the cold icy touch deep within my bowels.
[4198.98s -> 4201.54s]  It has not left me since last year.
[4203.86s -> 4214.70s]  Signed it hard.
[4214.70s -> 4216.14s]  Absolutely devilish.
[4216.86s -> 4220.70s]  I gotta eat this one.
[4220.70s -> 4222.38s]  I think I gotta eat this one.
[4222.38s -> 4223.34s]  That was a good one.
[4224.42s -> 4226.18s]  Found that one real recently.
[4227.14s -> 4233.18s]  Oh, yeah.
[4233.18s -> 4238.63s]  Good for joining me on
[4238.63s -> 4247.62s]  I gotta get my time here.
[4247.62s -> 4251.30s]  I'm told by Jeremy
[4251.30s -> 4252.94s]  that we are going to,
[4252.94s -> 4255.18s]  before the present opening ceremony,
[4255.98s -> 4257.26s]  we are going to go over
[4258.22s -> 4260.38s]  some of his favorite clips
[4260.38s -> 4262.30s]  from the past year or three
[4262.30s -> 4264.94s]  because it's been a full year.
[4264.94s -> 4266.94s]  I know it's crazy to think about that.
[4267.74s -> 4270.78s]  But I'll see you dastardly fucking dickhead
[4271.50s -> 4272.81s]  later.
[4272.81s -> 4277.80s]  Enjoy the fucking past year.
[4277.80s -> 4279.88s]  So it's all my fucking fault then?
[4279.88s -> 4280.68s]  You fucking...
[4281.72s -> 4282.60s]  Carol, you fucking...
[4282.60s -> 4283.64s]  You're gonna throw me the fucking water?
[4283.64s -> 4285.00s]  You're gonna throw me the fucking...
[4285.00s -> 4286.68s]  You know I didn't have a goddamn choice.
[4286.68s -> 4287.64s]  You know I fucking...
[4287.64s -> 4288.20s]  Fuck.
[4288.20s -> 4288.68s]  Fuck you.
[4289.40s -> 4290.47s]  I did what I had to.
[4290.47s -> 4291.19s]  I fucking...
[4292.50s -> 4294.34s]  You can't fucking blame me for that.
[4294.34s -> 4295.30s]  Fucking bullshit.
[4295.30s -> 4296.74s]  Tell it again, tell it again.
[4296.74s -> 4298.82s]  Listen, I've told the story like four times.
[4299.38s -> 4302.42s]  Just please, let me be the example for this, okay?
[4303.62s -> 4305.38s]  Stay the fuck away from yard tools.
[4305.94s -> 4307.22s]  Don't touch anything dangerous.
[4307.22s -> 4308.42s]  Don't like rake your leaves.
[4308.42s -> 4309.30s]  You're gonna like, duh!
[4309.30s -> 4310.66s]  And then all of a sudden you got
[4310.66s -> 4312.66s]  $1,400 worth of dentistry wear.
[4312.66s -> 4313.62s]  Actually can't beat him.
[4314.98s -> 4316.34s]  He swings way too weirdly.
[4317.70s -> 4320.50s]  And I can't even get the correct controls right.
[4320.50s -> 4321.70s]  Shouldn't do R2 twice.
[4321.70s -> 4323.14s]  Don't even think about it.
[4324.18s -> 4324.98s]  All right.
[4324.98s -> 4325.78s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[4326.66s -> 4327.06s]  Come on.
[4328.58s -> 4329.46s]  No, no, no, back up!
[4331.13s -> 4332.01s]  No!
[4332.01s -> 4332.51s]  Oh!
[4336.02s -> 4336.58s]  What the fuck?
[4337.14s -> 4337.78s]  Yikes!
[4338.50s -> 4340.26s]  Oh, okay, it's a big guy.
[4340.26s -> 4342.79s]  Uh, I don't know what to do.
[4342.79s -> 4343.43s]  Holy shit.
[4344.39s -> 4345.24s]  This guy.
[4345.88s -> 4346.52s]  I gotta jump.
[4347.08s -> 4349.10s]  And listen to this music that's playing.
[4349.90s -> 4350.70s]  Oh my god.
[4350.70s -> 4353.18s]  Sir, you seem to be having a trouble with your car here.
[4353.82s -> 4356.46s]  Well, let me fix that for you with a yellow...
[4357.58s -> 4358.94s]  Oh, and I farted!
[4358.94s -> 4359.74s]  And I farted!
[4361.42s -> 4362.86s]  I don't see how people think that's weird.
[4363.50s -> 4364.89s]  Why do you think that's weird?
[4364.89s -> 4365.93s]  You think that's weird that I've never
[4365.93s -> 4367.37s]  eaten pepperoni on my pizza before?
[4368.09s -> 4369.80s]  I'll get pepperoni for you here.
[4371.08s -> 4385.32s]  So it's all my fucking fault then?
[4385.32s -> 4385.64s]  I didn't mean it.
[4385.64s -> 4386.44s]  You fucking...
[4387.40s -> 4387.88s]  Oh, you fucking...
[4387.88s -> 4389.32s]  You're gonna throw me to the fucking wall too?
[4389.32s -> 4390.68s]  You're gonna fucking throw me to the fucking...
[4390.68s -> 4392.44s]  You know I didn't have a goddamn choice.
[4392.44s -> 4393.24s]  You know I fucking...
[4393.24s -> 4393.96s]  What the fuck?
[4393.96s -> 4394.36s]  Fuck you.
[4395.48s -> 4396.20s]  I did what I had to!
[4396.20s -> 4396.92s]  I fucking...
[4398.30s -> 4400.14s]  You can't fucking blame me for that.
[4400.14s -> 4401.10s]  Fucking bullshit!
[4401.10s -> 4402.54s]  Tell it again, tell it again, tell it...
[4402.54s -> 4404.54s]  Listen, I've told the story like four times.
[4405.10s -> 4408.22s]  Just please, let me be the example for this, okay?
[4409.42s -> 4411.66s]  Stay the fuck away from yard tools.
[4411.66s -> 4412.94s]  Don't touch anything dangerous.
[4412.94s -> 4414.14s]  Don't like break your leaves.
[4414.14s -> 4415.02s]  You're gonna like...
[4415.02s -> 4416.38s]  And then all of a sudden you got
[4416.38s -> 4418.46s]  1400 dollars worth of dentistry work.
[4418.46s -> 4419.34s]  Actually can't beat him.
[4420.70s -> 4422.06s]  He swings way too weirdly.
[4423.42s -> 4426.22s]  And I can't even get the correct controls right.
[4426.22s -> 4427.42s]  Shouldn't do R2 twice.
[4427.42s -> 4428.86s]  Don't even think about it.
[4429.98s -> 4430.70s]  All right.
[4430.70s -> 4431.50s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[4432.38s -> 4432.78s]  Come on.
[4434.30s -> 4434.78s]  No, no, no!
[4434.78s -> 4435.28s]  Back up!
[4441.75s -> 4442.31s]  What the fuck?
[4442.87s -> 4443.51s]  Yikes!
[4444.23s -> 4445.75s]  Oh, okay, it's big guy.
[4445.99s -> 4448.58s]  Uh, I don't know what to do.
[4448.58s -> 4449.22s]  Holy shit.
[4450.55s -> 4451.03s]  This guy.
[4451.67s -> 4452.23s]  I gotta jump.
[4452.87s -> 4454.82s]  And listen to this music that's playing.
[4455.64s -> 4456.44s]  Oh my go-
[4456.44s -> 4458.92s]  Sir, you seem to be having a trouble with your car here.
[4459.64s -> 4462.20s]  Well, let me fix that for you with a yellow.
[4463.40s -> 4464.68s]  Oh, and I farted!
[4464.68s -> 4465.48s]  And I farted!
[4466.28s -> 4468.60s]  I don't see how people think that's weird.
[4469.75s -> 4470.71s]  Why do you think that's weird?
[4470.71s -> 4471.67s]  You think that's weird that I've never
[4471.67s -> 4473.11s]  eaten pepperoni on my pizza before?
[4474.31s -> 4475.59s]  I'll get pepperoni for you here.
[4476.47s -> 4519.66s]  Let me grab some.
[4520.54s -> 4521.98s]  Let me put the mic over here closer.
[4523.45s -> 4524.33s]  Hold on a second.
[4525.37s -> 4527.35s]  There we are.
[4530.95s -> 4531.91s]  There we go.
[4531.91s -> 4532.87s]  That's a little bit better.
[4533.51s -> 4534.23s]  Okay.
[4534.23s -> 4537.34s]  So we've got to the present opening portion of the stream.
[4538.30s -> 4539.66s]  And if you're curious what the hell this is,
[4541.74s -> 4545.10s]  a while back the chat talked about how,
[4545.74s -> 4547.66s]  you know, oh, let's buy them Pikachu and
[4548.54s -> 4551.02s]  Pokemon plushies on the internet.
[4551.02s -> 4552.22s]  And I thought it was funny.
[4552.22s -> 4554.70s]  So I said, okay, well, what if we just gave
[4554.70s -> 4557.82s]  chat a budget to just buy some presents for Christmas?
[4558.70s -> 4560.38s]  And it was a decent idea, I guess.
[4560.38s -> 4561.18s]  People thought it was fun.
[4561.74s -> 4563.02s]  And that's exactly what happened.
[4563.02s -> 4566.46s]  I just put up about $400 or so dollars
[4567.02s -> 4569.74s]  for chat to suggest presents.
[4569.74s -> 4572.06s]  And the mods also suggested presents as well.
[4572.62s -> 4574.46s]  I don't know what any of these are.
[4574.46s -> 4576.38s]  I have absolutely no idea.
[4576.38s -> 4579.82s]  And by the way, don't believe any things
[4579.82s -> 4582.70s]  you hear from internet scary stories
[4582.70s -> 4584.14s]  because they're just, none of them are real.
[4584.78s -> 4586.30s]  And if you think the demons are real,
[4586.30s -> 4588.38s]  then you just, I mean, they're made up by,
[4589.02s -> 4590.86s]  like, you think the Ghostbusters are real,
[4590.86s -> 4591.58s]  but they're not.
[4591.58s -> 4594.30s]  The Ghostbusters are made up by a handful of guys
[4594.30s -> 4596.70s]  who thought it was funny to make ghost stories and shit.
[4596.70s -> 4599.18s]  But he's gone.
[4600.30s -> 4603.34s]  I made sure he got paid and he's gone.
[4603.34s -> 4605.50s]  So just don't believe anything you hear on the internet
[4605.50s -> 4606.94s]  because the internet's obviously fucked up.
[4606.94s -> 4609.26s]  They don't really fucking believe anything on the internet.
[4609.26s -> 4611.10s]  So I don't know what any of these are.
[4611.10s -> 4614.54s]  I have Kim Raptum and Italics,
[4615.26s -> 4617.18s]  my wonderful tech director here,
[4617.18s -> 4620.30s]  has bought them under my Amazon.
[4620.30s -> 4621.50s]  So I have no idea what they are.
[4622.22s -> 4623.50s]  And we also, by the way,
[4624.38s -> 4628.46s]  we have the Christmas Magical Facts Machine.
[4628.46s -> 4630.22s]  So if you do have something to say,
[4630.94s -> 4632.38s]  it's going to be printed out here.
[4632.38s -> 4634.06s]  If you give a bit donation,
[4634.06s -> 4635.42s]  it's going to be printed out here.
[4638.20s -> 4639.56s]  Probably. Maybe.
[4639.56s -> 4641.24s]  I don't know if it fucking works.
[4642.04s -> 4643.16s]  But let's get started.
[4643.72s -> 4647.64s]  So there are, I think, 20-something gifts.
[4647.64s -> 4649.32s]  And I want to make this very clear
[4649.32s -> 4651.08s]  because I think maybe some people don't know
[4651.08s -> 4652.28s]  what's going to happen at the end of this.
[4653.32s -> 4655.40s]  If there are things in here that I'm not going to use
[4656.04s -> 4659.56s]  or if there are things that I think are not worth
[4659.56s -> 4661.32s]  maybe me keeping long term,
[4661.32s -> 4663.00s]  if there's some things that might,
[4663.00s -> 4664.92s]  maybe some of the family or some of the person
[4664.92s -> 4669.08s]  might get better use of a toy or something,
[4669.08s -> 4671.08s]  then that with the train as well
[4671.08s -> 4673.72s]  is going to go to a donation circle.
[4673.72s -> 4675.24s]  So we'll see.
[4675.24s -> 4677.24s]  I might just keep some of this shit.
[4677.24s -> 4677.88s]  We'll find out.
[4677.88s -> 4678.92s]  So the first one we're going to open,
[4679.88s -> 4682.04s]  and this is not like a bit, by the way,
[4682.04s -> 4683.48s]  like the last couple things with bits.
[4684.36s -> 4686.20s]  But, you know, this is not a joke.
[4686.20s -> 4687.32s]  I don't know what the fuck is in here.
[4687.96s -> 4689.16s]  So let's go and open this one.
[4689.16s -> 4690.52s]  This is the first present we're going to open.
[4691.64s -> 4692.86s]  I don't know what it is.
[4693.02s -> 4694.46s]  And it's like, we're like, oh, yeah,
[4694.46s -> 4696.06s]  there's like a few hundred dollars
[4696.06s -> 4698.86s]  to like buy me presents from my own stream.
[4698.86s -> 4699.90s]  It's like a little weird,
[4699.90s -> 4702.46s]  but it's just an unboxing kind of thing.
[4702.46s -> 4703.42s]  I thought it was fun.
[4704.06s -> 4709.38s]  And this is called, this is the nut button.
[4709.38s -> 4710.18s]  Okay.
[4710.18s -> 4713.67s]  I already can't wait to know what this is.
[4715.11s -> 4716.07s]  This is the first thing I open
[4716.07s -> 4724.10s]  and this is this fucking stupid thing.
[4724.10s -> 4729.69s]  What the hell am I going to, I can't donate this.
[4729.69s -> 4731.69s]  What am I going to do with this?
[4732.65s -> 4738.02s]  There is no use for this item.
[4738.90s -> 4741.66s]  It doesn't serve any purpose, not one.
[4745.29s -> 4747.05s]  Can I melt this plastic down
[4748.01s -> 4750.65s]  and turn it into like fucking water bottles?
[4752.33s -> 4753.13s]  That's all it does.
[4756.54s -> 4756.94s]  Oh yeah.
[4756.94s -> 4758.22s]  Oh, by the way, guys,
[4758.22s -> 4760.78s]  I'm going to donate most of the items here
[4760.78s -> 4762.38s]  to families in the, oh yeah.
[4763.43s -> 4764.07s]  Yeah. Let me dump.
[4765.80s -> 4767.48s]  I don't know what I'm going to do with this.
[4767.48s -> 4769.85s]  There's the nut button.
[4769.85s -> 4771.13s]  That's the first item.
[4771.13s -> 4772.49s]  Okay. We're going to go small for now.
[4772.49s -> 4773.61s]  I knocked it over.
[4773.61s -> 4774.41s]  Let's go with this one.
[4778.04s -> 4779.08s]  It's a Garfield costume.
[4779.08s -> 4780.28s]  I know what this is already.
[4781.90s -> 4783.26s]  This is a fucking Garfield.
[4783.26s -> 4785.10s]  I know it's a Garfield costume
[4785.10s -> 4786.30s]  and I'm just going to open it
[4786.30s -> 4787.50s]  because I know exactly what it is.
[4798.86s -> 4799.58s]  Captain Morgan,
[4799.58s -> 4801.66s]  I want to see the Grifters basketballs.
[4806.74s -> 4808.42s]  I don't have time for that.
[4808.42s -> 4810.42s]  What? Captain Morgan says,
[4810.42s -> 4812.10s]  I want to see the Grifters basketballs.
[4814.12s -> 4815.24s]  Frodingweapon says,
[4815.24s -> 4817.72s]  can you tell Ninja to stream on Christmas?
[4823.10s -> 4824.38s]  I don't know Ninja.
[4824.38s -> 4825.34s]  I don't talk to him.
[4825.34s -> 4825.84s]  What?
[4826.87s -> 4828.39s]  Thank you, Cobra Cat, by the way.
[4828.39s -> 4829.59s]  Best Christmas to be honest.
[4829.59s -> 4830.39s]  Hashtag charity.
[4830.39s -> 4831.51s]  Thanks for the charity, by the way.
[4832.63s -> 4834.23s]  There's the Christmas fucking fax machine
[4834.23s -> 4835.51s]  coming out here with some weird shit.
[4836.07s -> 4837.11s]  Here's the Garfield.
[4837.11s -> 4838.63s]  Oh, put it on.
[4838.63s -> 4839.75s]  Is everybody saying put it on?
[4840.71s -> 4841.93s]  Is that what they're saying?
[4842.49s -> 4843.77s]  I fucking knew what it was
[4843.77s -> 4844.73s]  when I saw it in the back.
[4846.14s -> 4846.78s]  What are they saying?
[4848.01s -> 4849.21s]  Yeah. Put it on.
[4849.21s -> 4859.27s]  I don't want to do that.
[4859.27s -> 4860.39s]  Like, I can't,
[4860.39s -> 4862.31s]  how am I going to donate the shit?
[4864.18s -> 4865.22s]  Hey, by the way,
[4865.22s -> 4866.82s]  you want a Garfield costume?
[4866.82s -> 4868.82s]  No, I'm not putting this on.
[4868.82s -> 4869.32s]  Okay?
[4911.26s -> 4919.50s]  If that was fun, let's get it off.
[4923.75s -> 4924.71s]  I'm sorry, Mom.
[4926.39s -> 4927.43s]  I'm sorry, Mom.
[4928.15s -> 4929.67s]  Mom is like watching the stream
[4929.67s -> 4930.39s]  and she's probably like,
[4930.39s -> 4931.91s]  what the fuck is my son doing?
[4933.50s -> 4935.35s]  So this is gift number three.
[4936.63s -> 4938.82s]  Again, I don't know what these are
[4938.82s -> 4941.03s]  and we'll find out.
[4946.55s -> 4948.23s]  Oh, you got to be fucking kidding me.
[4948.23s -> 4949.67s]  I talked about this like the other,
[4949.67s -> 4951.27s]  like not even two weeks ago.
[4952.23s -> 4954.10s]  This is an Airzooka.
[4954.10s -> 4955.30s]  You got to shoot me in the fucking face
[4955.30s -> 4955.78s]  with this thing.
[4956.92s -> 4957.48s]  I'm serious.
[4963.86s -> 4964.82s]  Airzooka.
[4969.29s -> 4970.49s]  These things are so awesome.
[4970.49s -> 4971.77s]  You can, like from a mile away,
[4971.77s -> 4972.81s]  you can hit somebody right in the face.
[4973.53s -> 4974.33s]  You'll see the air.
[4975.90s -> 4977.58s]  Oh, I can't, I can't wait
[4977.58s -> 4979.10s]  to like donate this.
[4979.10s -> 4980.14s]  Someone's going to have so much
[4980.14s -> 4981.02s]  fucking fun with this thing.
[4981.02s -> 4981.52s]  Seriously.
[4990.70s -> 4993.18s]  HowToPrinters is the great Canadian
[4993.18s -> 4993.90s]  with $50.
[4997.50s -> 4998.06s]  That's how.
[5000.89s -> 5001.39s]  Fuck.
[5004.15s -> 5006.39s]  Thank you from zero two for the $10.
[5006.39s -> 5007.99s]  Hey, Jerma, my name is Lucy
[5007.99s -> 5009.59s]  and your streams make me smile so much.
[5009.59s -> 5012.31s]  I made Jerma remix 10 for green screen night
[5012.31s -> 5013.75s]  and I felt so proud when it was shown.
[5013.75s -> 5014.79s]  This community is so great.
[5014.79s -> 5015.43s]  Thanks for the laughs.
[5015.43s -> 5016.15s]  Happy holidays.
[5016.87s -> 5017.91s]  Happy fucking day.
[5017.91s -> 5019.75s]  Edgemont, thanks for the $50.
[5019.75s -> 5021.19s]  Your fax machine is broken.
[5021.19s -> 5023.51s]  The thing is this thing sucks, okay?
[5024.07s -> 5025.11s]  You want to know why the stream
[5025.11s -> 5026.55s]  was like an hour late?
[5026.55s -> 5027.91s]  Because we were trying to figure out
[5027.91s -> 5028.95s]  so desperately how to get,
[5028.95s -> 5030.95s]  how to get this fucking thing to work.
[5030.95s -> 5033.43s]  It is a basic HP printer
[5033.51s -> 5036.38s]  that's plugged in with USB.
[5036.38s -> 5037.50s]  Oh my goodness.
[5037.50s -> 5038.78s]  Was it a fucking pain in the ass?
[5040.49s -> 5043.10s]  But help, I'm trapped in the printer.
[5043.10s -> 5044.86s]  It says Spartan cat.
[5044.86s -> 5045.98s]  Well, you're out here now.
[5045.98s -> 5047.43s]  You're out now.
[5048.39s -> 5051.58s]  And Airzooka, if you don't know,
[5051.58s -> 5053.40s]  is a device.
[5053.40s -> 5056.78s]  I don't have to read the rules.
[5056.78s -> 5058.62s]  So you pull on one end.
[5058.62s -> 5059.42s]  I'm going to shoot it out.
[5059.42s -> 5059.98s]  It's right in the face.
[5059.98s -> 5060.48s]  Watch this.
[5062.39s -> 5063.67s]  Make sure I box this up nice
[5063.67s -> 5065.19s]  because this is fucking awesome.
[5065.19s -> 5065.67s]  Awesome.
[5065.67s -> 5071.62s]  Whoa, this piece is here.
[5071.62s -> 5072.10s]  Yep.
[5072.10s -> 5073.54s]  So you pull back on this
[5073.54s -> 5074.82s]  and it gives a bunch of air pressure
[5074.82s -> 5075.22s]  forward.
[5075.94s -> 5086.42s]  So, hey, you're going to tell me
[5086.42s -> 5087.46s]  if this hits you like right in the face.
[5088.02s -> 5089.77s]  I used to be really good at this shit.
[5090.73s -> 5095.70s]  Can I take the Garfield costume off?
[5095.70s -> 5098.30s]  Like, can I?
[5098.30s -> 5099.42s]  That's like, that's funny, right?
[5099.42s -> 5100.22s]  If it's off.
[5100.22s -> 5102.15s]  It has to stay on.
[5102.15s -> 5102.95s]  It has to stay on.
[5104.47s -> 5104.95s]  I really-
[5104.95s -> 5107.53s]  You're going to lose viewers.
[5107.53s -> 5108.65s]  Is it weird that I don't care?
[5109.69s -> 5115.00s]  I want to get the Garfield fucking costume
[5115.00s -> 5115.88s]  off of my body.
[5116.44s -> 5120.55s]  You're going to lose viewers.
[5121.35s -> 5122.79s]  But the Garfield costume
[5122.79s -> 5123.91s]  gets to come off.
[5123.91s -> 5125.19s]  So that's like a plus.
[5125.35s -> 5126.79s]  So here's this part.
[5126.79s -> 5133.21s]  I could snipe people away from so far.
[5133.21s -> 5133.93s]  All right, hold on.
[5133.93s -> 5135.37s]  Let me get this connected here.
[5135.37s -> 5136.33s]  How the fuck is this?
[5136.33s -> 5137.77s]  Is there instructions with this?
[5147.75s -> 5148.63s]  Okay, here's the button.
[5148.63s -> 5149.59s]  I got to plug it in here.
[5149.59s -> 5149.99s]  Okay.
[5150.79s -> 5151.75s]  Dude, check this out.
[5152.55s -> 5153.03s]  I want-
[5153.03s -> 5153.99s]  I'm serious, dude.
[5153.99s -> 5155.03s]  I want you to stand across
[5155.03s -> 5155.83s]  the whole entire studio
[5155.83s -> 5156.71s]  and I want you to shoot me
[5156.71s -> 5157.83s]  in the fucking face with this.
[5158.87s -> 5159.99s]  People think this is a joke,
[5159.99s -> 5163.54s]  but this is the real deal.
[5164.26s -> 5165.22s]  Does that connect like that?
[5165.22s -> 5168.87s]  Do I actually need these fucking instructions?
[5182.17s -> 5183.21s]  Did I put it on wrong?
[5183.69s -> 5189.83s]  Did I put it on wrong?
[5190.39s -> 5195.83s]  I think I put it on wrong.
[5195.83s -> 5198.04s]  All right.
[5198.04s -> 5199.24s]  Hey, can you like figure this out?
[5200.60s -> 5202.20s]  Can you like fucking-
[5202.20s -> 5204.68s]  Well, because it's like too hard.
[5204.68s -> 5206.92s]  It's too hard for my fucking tiny brain.
[5206.92s -> 5208.52s]  Just read the instructions
[5210.36s -> 5212.28s]  and figure out how to shoot.
[5212.28s -> 5214.20s]  I have the trigger on the wrong way.
[5214.20s -> 5214.52s]  All right.
[5214.52s -> 5215.64s]  Airzooka.
[5215.64s -> 5216.76s]  That's a lot of fun.
[5216.76s -> 5219.00s]  I can't wait to get fucking in the face.
[5219.64s -> 5221.42s]  Remember that one?
[5222.06s -> 5231.34s]  Pile over there.
[5231.34s -> 5231.66s]  All right.
[5231.66s -> 5232.14s]  Next one.
[5233.66s -> 5234.30s]  I'm sorry.
[5235.34s -> 5235.58s]  Damn.
[5236.38s -> 5236.62s]  All right.
[5236.62s -> 5237.26s]  Here's another one.
[5239.05s -> 5240.57s]  So again, this is just an-
[5240.57s -> 5241.05s]  I already-
[5241.05s -> 5242.49s]  I explained it like four times.
[5251.43s -> 5252.31s]  What is this?
[5260.20s -> 5263.98s]  Five pound box of assorted misprint
[5264.70s -> 5266.94s]  rackable office big bulk lot.
[5270.14s -> 5271.18s]  What the fuck does that even mean?
[5272.94s -> 5273.90s]  I don't know what that means.
[5277.24s -> 5278.68s]  That's a long sentence.
[5285.51s -> 5286.23s]  What am I gonna-
[5286.87s -> 5289.59s]  What am I gonna do with this many fucking-
[5290.47s -> 5291.11s]  It's pens.
[5291.83s -> 5292.07s]  Why?
[5292.71s -> 5293.67s]  Oh my god.
[5293.67s -> 5293.99s]  Okay.
[5294.71s -> 5300.58s]  Is this-
[5301.22s -> 5305.00s]  These are pretty-
[5305.00s -> 5306.20s]  Actually pretty cool.
[5306.20s -> 5306.52s]  All right.
[5306.52s -> 5306.92s]  Hold on.
[5307.80s -> 5310.44s]  Liberty Tools from the Bronx.
[5310.44s -> 5314.73s]  It's like 500 pens.
[5321.19s -> 5323.75s]  I'm gonna take like three of these and store them.
[5324.63s -> 5325.67s]  And I gotta like-
[5325.67s -> 5326.79s]  What am I gonna fucking do with these?
[5326.79s -> 5328.79s]  I'm gonna have to donate them or send them somewhere.
[5330.47s -> 5331.35s]  Jesus Christ.
[5331.35s -> 5333.11s]  Well, that's really funny.
[5337.91s -> 5338.63s]  What is this?
[5339.35s -> 5342.78s]  This is from Nationwide Insurance.
[5345.98s -> 5347.58s]  Who packaged this shit?
[5348.22s -> 5349.26s]  That's what I want to know.
[5350.31s -> 5353.59s]  Somebody had to put these all into a box.
[5356.82s -> 5358.82s]  What like weird pen company are you?
[5359.70s -> 5361.26s]  This is like a misprint.
[5362.14s -> 5362.86s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[5362.86s -> 5363.58s]  I'm gonna like-
[5363.58s -> 5365.58s]  I'm gonna take a trip to like a bunch of law offices
[5365.58s -> 5365.90s]  and be like,
[5365.90s -> 5367.02s]  I want some fucking pens.
[5368.30s -> 5369.85s]  Well, thank you for the pens,
[5369.85s -> 5370.97s]  whoever suggested that.
[5371.69s -> 5372.49s]  That's good stuff.
[5373.61s -> 5374.62s]  Get this one.
[5375.34s -> 5377.54s]  You still trying to figure out the air, Zuka?
[5379.70s -> 5381.34s]  Get this off.
[5381.34s -> 5383.98s]  You're gonna have to like hire some more help for this one.
[5384.62s -> 5387.59s]  Is my hair all fucked up?
[5388.63s -> 5393.32s]  What is in here?
[5393.32s -> 5406.06s]  It's the Bitcoin Inner Gnome.
[5408.28s -> 5410.44s]  11 inches high gnome statue.
[5411.24s -> 5413.24s]  Exclusively designed by Joystick.
[5413.24s -> 5415.72s]  Hand painted with exquisite details.
[5415.72s -> 5417.88s]  Funny Bitcoin good luck charm.
[5417.88s -> 5419.48s]  Great for indoor and outdoor use.
[5423.08s -> 5424.36s]  This is gonna have to go on my desk.
[5424.36s -> 5425.16s]  It's not gonna happen.
[5427.16s -> 5428.12s]  Oh, God.
[5430.52s -> 5432.84s]  I have to see what it looks like.
[5432.84s -> 5433.88s]  I need to know what it looks like.
[5437.19s -> 5443.18s]  Fucking Bitcoin.
[5443.82s -> 5447.14s]  I haven't talked about Bitcoin in like seven months.
[5465.99s -> 5467.51s]  This thing sucks.
[5468.47s -> 5469.75s]  This sucks, okay?
[5470.55s -> 5471.05s]  I-
[5471.67s -> 5478.41s]  There you go.
[5484.38s -> 5485.66s]  This doesn't go in your-
[5485.66s -> 5486.94s]  Do you put this in your front lawn?
[5486.94s -> 5488.06s]  Is that what it's designed for?
[5491.22s -> 5492.90s]  I have no idea where this goes.
[5492.90s -> 5494.50s]  Do you put this like on your kitchen counter?
[5495.61s -> 5497.29s]  Why would you own this?
[5497.29s -> 5501.05s]  Hey, remember that thing I bought that dropped 75% in value?
[5503.21s -> 5506.41s]  This must have been a product that was sold like 11 months ago
[5506.41s -> 5507.29s]  and people thought it was cool.
[5509.78s -> 5510.82s]  Well, I'm gonna have to-
[5510.82s -> 5512.18s]  I'll just put it on my mantle.
[5516.78s -> 5517.66s]  All right, what's next?
[5518.46s -> 5519.98s]  I got some fucking trash.
[5521.18s -> 5523.66s]  Can you grab like a trash box?
[5526.10s -> 5526.82s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[5527.70s -> 5528.68s]  This one's heavy.
[5540.10s -> 5550.22s]  This is the walkeroo stilts.
[5554.14s -> 5556.86s]  Easy walking handheld stilts.
[5556.86s -> 5561.46s]  That's really, really funny.
[5568.09s -> 5568.57s]  Oh, great.
[5569.80s -> 5572.92s]  Yeah, let me like put these on and pretend I'm fucking 6'4".
[5575.42s -> 5576.14s]  I can't even.
[5578.52s -> 5580.52s]  Why do they have to have like children on here?
[5580.52s -> 5582.28s]  That just makes it so much worse.
[5582.28s -> 5583.56s]  Yeah, I'll just throw it in there.
[5585.62s -> 5586.26s]  Walkeroo.
[5590.22s -> 5592.22s]  I'm not even gonna be able to reach these.
[5592.22s -> 5594.86s]  We're gonna have to cut to the other camera while I-
[5596.22s -> 5599.35s]  Are you still figuring out the bazooka?
[5599.35s -> 5601.59s]  It's got four pages of instruction.
[5603.27s -> 5606.78s]  Who would have thought that it would be that hard?
[5607.88s -> 5608.76s]  Oh, my God.
[5610.09s -> 5612.65s]  Hey, Merry fucking Christmas and happy holidays to you.
[5613.37s -> 5614.65s]  How bad is my hair look?
[5615.93s -> 5616.89s]  Be honest with me, dude.
[5616.89s -> 5617.61s]  Like be real.
[5617.61s -> 5618.49s]  I want you to be honest.
[5619.53s -> 5622.01s]  Like, should I put like something on?
[5622.01s -> 5623.05s]  Should I put the hat back on?
[5623.69s -> 5625.21s]  The car feels like a bad one.
[5625.21s -> 5626.89s]  But I'd rather look terrible.
[5631.10s -> 5631.74s]  Look, I can't.
[5631.74s -> 5632.78s]  I'll open that later.
[5633.58s -> 5634.62s]  Look at all this shit.
[5635.82s -> 5640.10s]  What am I gonna do with the pens?
[5643.56s -> 5645.24s]  I'll do this later at the end of the stream.
[5648.44s -> 5649.64s]  All right, oh, we got some more.
[5650.20s -> 5655.62s]  There's a stocking here.
[5655.62s -> 5656.82s]  Let's go ahead and open the stocking.
[5656.82s -> 5667.14s]  Why not?
[5667.14s -> 5669.22s]  There's a single earbud.
[5669.22s -> 5677.06s]  Is this because-
[5679.54s -> 5680.98s]  So I get this one.
[5680.98s -> 5681.86s]  I actually do get it.
[5682.82s -> 5684.90s]  A single earbud.
[5684.90s -> 5687.30s]  That was my favorite one.
[5687.30s -> 5693.54s]  Because, I mean, it's pretty comfortable.
[5704.38s -> 5706.94s]  Okay, for those of you that have no fucking idea what this is,
[5708.14s -> 5712.46s]  I can't wear two headphones because I'm fucking strange.
[5713.26s -> 5714.94s]  And when I have two headphones in,
[5714.94s -> 5717.58s]  it causes me all kinds of distraction and stress.
[5718.22s -> 5720.70s]  And it closes me off in the whole world and I feel weird.
[5721.66s -> 5723.66s]  So thanks for the one earbud.
[5724.70s -> 5726.58s]  Do I get stereo from here?
[5726.58s -> 5727.94s]  Can I get stereo sound from this?
[5735.03s -> 5736.79s]  I'm actually gonna use that.
[5736.79s -> 5737.99s]  I'm actually gonna use that one.
[5739.19s -> 5742.82s]  Hey, how's that Airzooka doing over there?
[5743.62s -> 5745.37s]  What else is in the stocking?
[5755.32s -> 5756.44s]  I don't know what this is.
[5756.44s -> 5757.42s]  What is this?
[5766.12s -> 5767.48s]  This is black gloves?
[5770.38s -> 5771.10s]  What's the joke?
[5771.82s -> 5772.54s]  I don't understand.
[5773.90s -> 5775.90s]  Why, I don't, why, what's the joke here?
[5776.94s -> 5779.18s]  It's just long black leather gloves.
[5781.27s -> 5785.03s]  I feel care instructions.
[5785.03s -> 5787.83s]  Hand wash, do not wring, do not tumble dry.
[5788.71s -> 5789.98s]  Is this a sex thing?
[5791.51s -> 5793.11s]  Hey, is this a sex thing?
[5793.11s -> 5793.43s]  You know?
[5795.96s -> 5798.10s]  I said no sex things.
[5798.82s -> 5800.74s]  I don't think I can answer that question.
[5800.74s -> 5805.26s]  I can't even fit my fucking hands in here.
[5805.26s -> 5805.58s]  What?
[5806.46s -> 5811.06s]  Is this handle long?
[5811.06s -> 5811.62s]  Yes.
[5811.62s -> 5813.64s]  That's why I can't figure it out.
[5813.64s -> 5815.32s]  What is fucking going on here?
[5816.04s -> 5817.16s]  Oh, those are for your feet.
[5820.34s -> 5821.30s]  Are you sure?
[5821.30s -> 5822.50s]  Oh yeah, they're for your feet.
[5824.23s -> 5824.87s]  No, they're not.
[5824.87s -> 5825.51s]  They're gloves.
[5825.51s -> 5826.47s]  Those are for your feet.
[5827.11s -> 5828.31s]  No, there's a hand.
[5829.51s -> 5832.79s]  I'm not taking my fucking socks off.
[5833.59s -> 5834.87s]  You can't see your feet right now.
[5837.03s -> 5838.87s]  Are you sure these aren't just weird gloves?
[5840.47s -> 5841.99s]  They're gloves for your feet.
[5842.23s -> 5844.39s]  Why would somebody wear these?
[5847.93s -> 5849.29s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[5849.85s -> 5857.08s]  Don't look at me.
[5858.02s -> 5859.14s]  Don't put your feet up there.
[5861.80s -> 5864.28s]  Are you talking shit or is this for real?
[5865.00s -> 5865.80s]  I'm serious.
[5865.80s -> 5867.24s]  I put this on my feet.
[5867.24s -> 5871.10s]  Yeah, that's what the gift is.
[5872.20s -> 5874.12s]  It's foot leather gloves.
[5874.12s -> 5875.48s]  Amazon Prime, baby.
[5876.28s -> 5877.32s]  Foot leather gloves.
[5881.16s -> 5882.92s]  I just don't, I don't understand it.
[5885.91s -> 5886.41s]  Okay.
[5891.08s -> 5894.57s]  You weren't supposed to put the handle on.
[5895.37s -> 5897.13s]  This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[5898.97s -> 5901.21s]  I've seen a lot of dumb shit in my whole life.
[5902.25s -> 5904.89s]  And honestly, I went to fireworks one time.
[5904.89s -> 5907.37s]  I went to the fireworks show when I was probably 14.
[5908.25s -> 5911.13s]  And they did like four fireworks and it ended the show.
[5911.13s -> 5911.93s]  And I said to myself,
[5911.93s -> 5913.45s]  I'll never see anything stupider than this.
[5913.45s -> 5914.17s]  Never in my life.
[5915.13s -> 5915.85s]  I have now.
[5917.05s -> 5919.37s]  This is the worst thing I've ever put on my body.
[5919.37s -> 5920.97s]  It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[5923.03s -> 5924.23s]  You did the Airzooka.
[5924.23s -> 5925.35s]  You broke it.
[5925.35s -> 5926.31s]  I broke the Airzooka.
[5926.31s -> 5929.03s]  You weren't supposed to put the handle on here.
[5929.03s -> 5930.15s]  Take the handle off.
[5930.15s -> 5932.71s]  You take the handle off with your feet or something.
[5932.71s -> 5934.39s]  You've got good grip down there.
[5935.43s -> 5939.67s]  I don't, who would ever put these on?
[5939.67s -> 5941.51s]  I gotta move on because I can't handle this.
[5942.55s -> 5944.15s]  Don't, you're gonna, don't throw it to me.
[5947.02s -> 5948.62s]  All right, here, this is another gift.
[5952.63s -> 5953.91s]  Wow, that was explosive.
[5958.14s -> 5961.72s]  Maybe there's like feet in here.
[5962.28s -> 5977.40s]  Banana award.
[5977.40s -> 5985.26s]  All that's in here is this top banana award.
[5985.26s -> 5988.65s]  How much was this, do you know?
[5991.11s -> 5992.79s]  I know this is like 30.
[5992.79s -> 5994.39s]  There's at least 10 in here.
[5994.39s -> 5997.99s]  I don't even show them all.
[6005.96s -> 6008.52s]  How many top bananas can there possibly be?
[6009.91s -> 6011.91s]  Isn't there only one top banana?
[6012.71s -> 6013.83s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[6014.63s -> 6023.54s]  I'll keep one because I'm the top banana.
[6023.54s -> 6024.66s]  I got the top banana.
[6025.38s -> 6040.44s]  That sounded wrong, but what else is in the stocking?
[6040.44s -> 6041.24s]  Let's find out.
[6041.24s -> 6042.68s]  Okay, oh, look at this.
[6042.68s -> 6044.04s]  It's blue and what's in it?
[6044.04s -> 6046.04s]  Ooh, a sex thing.
[6046.76s -> 6048.04s]  This is called the Ubing.
[6049.08s -> 6050.04s]  Enjoy shopping.
[6050.04s -> 6052.20s]  This has got a kind of a fucked up,
[6052.20s -> 6055.24s]  like grayed out, blacked out kind of case.
[6056.95s -> 6057.83s]  This is a sex thing.
[6057.83s -> 6067.86s]  I know it.
[6067.86s -> 6068.90s]  No, this is cool.
[6068.90s -> 6069.86s]  I would actually wear this.
[6070.58s -> 6071.38s]  This is actually kind of cool.
[6073.48s -> 6074.12s]  I'll wear this.
[6075.37s -> 6076.49s]  You guys think it's a joke.
[6076.49s -> 6079.53s]  I'm going to actually wear this like on a daily basis.
[6080.25s -> 6081.85s]  It's got aeration.
[6081.85s -> 6082.89s]  It's got plenty of air.
[6083.45s -> 6087.83s]  I don't like what a daily basis.
[6088.63s -> 6089.80s]  What's wrong with that?
[6090.94s -> 6093.40s]  It's got breatheable.
[6093.40s -> 6096.65s]  It's I actually kind of like this.
[6097.85s -> 6099.05s]  This is sex thing.
[6099.05s -> 6099.77s]  Let's find out.
[6106.01s -> 6107.45s]  It's just a nice tank top.
[6107.45s -> 6112.33s]  You got to go full Garfield or full no Garfield?
[6114.15s -> 6114.71s]  Not working.
[6115.43s -> 6116.15s]  Says who though?
[6134.90s -> 6135.30s]  Hold on.
[6135.30s -> 6137.30s]  Let me use my like my like foot grip.
[6141.98s -> 6143.10s]  I knew this was going to happen.
[6143.10s -> 6143.82s]  Didn't I tell you that?
[6143.82s -> 6144.94s]  Didn't I tell you that one of the things
[6144.94s -> 6146.62s]  was going to be a Garfield costume?
[6146.62s -> 6147.58s]  I was certain.
[6147.58s -> 6151.40s]  It's funny that that was a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[6151.40s -> 6152.28s]  Are you sure?
[6152.28s -> 6154.84s]  Yeah, I didn't make the original list.
[6158.17s -> 6160.09s]  Yeah, but I just knew that there was going
[6160.09s -> 6161.85s]  to be a Garfield costume in here.
[6161.85s -> 6164.09s]  But if you hadn't have told me that
[6164.09s -> 6165.77s]  there wasn't going to be one.
[6165.77s -> 6166.81s]  No, but there was.
[6166.81s -> 6167.85s]  There always will be.
[6168.73s -> 6168.97s]  All right.
[6168.97s -> 6170.17s]  Has that does that look like I'm going?
[6171.45s -> 6174.26s]  Dude, my fly was down in the first
[6174.26s -> 6175.54s]  fucking 10 seconds of the stream.
[6176.74s -> 6178.58s]  I'm talking that was like a triple fly.
[6179.22s -> 6182.74s]  That conductor outfit had a like quad fly.
[6182.74s -> 6184.42s]  It was like from here to here.
[6185.58s -> 6187.82s]  So can I be embarrassed anymore on the stream?
[6187.82s -> 6188.46s]  I don't think so.
[6189.34s -> 6190.38s]  Thanks for the sex thing.
[6191.02s -> 6192.22s]  Whoever suggested that.
[6193.02s -> 6193.83s]  All right.
[6193.83s -> 6194.55s]  What else is in here?
[6195.27s -> 6197.91s]  This feels like clay.
[6198.63s -> 6211.02s]  Is this like a dick?
[6211.02s -> 6212.78s]  This is like a hairy dick.
[6212.78s -> 6214.78s]  I thought I said no like dicks.
[6216.14s -> 6217.82s]  This is not a hairy dick.
[6217.82s -> 6218.14s]  No.
[6218.14s -> 6219.10s]  Are you sure?
[6219.10s -> 6219.50s]  Yeah.
[6219.50s -> 6220.70s]  If I open this on streaming,
[6220.70s -> 6222.06s]  this is like a big hairy cock.
[6222.06s -> 6223.42s]  I'm going to be fucking really mad.
[6224.14s -> 6225.18s]  It's a fanny pack.
[6230.20s -> 6231.56s]  No, that's a big dick.
[6232.44s -> 6233.88s]  That's not a fanny pack.
[6233.88s -> 6235.16s]  Horizontal.
[6235.16s -> 6242.04s]  I hate this.
[6242.04s -> 6247.56s]  This is like a fucking hairy cock.
[6247.64s -> 6252.62s]  I swear to God.
[6252.62s -> 6255.13s]  I'm not going to win.
[6259.24s -> 6259.80s]  Oh yeah.
[6259.80s -> 6260.44s]  Top banana.
[6260.44s -> 6261.56s]  That's fucking great.
[6261.56s -> 6264.84s]  Oh, by the way, all these gifts are going to charity.
[6265.85s -> 6268.41s]  Can't wait to send top banana.
[6268.41s -> 6268.89s]  I can't.
[6270.38s -> 6270.78s]  Oh yeah.
[6270.78s -> 6271.02s]  What?
[6271.02s -> 6272.86s]  Like you want like a dad dick?
[6272.86s -> 6273.34s]  Yeah.
[6273.90s -> 6276.22s]  Give me a break.
[6276.22s -> 6281.40s]  Whatever.
[6281.40s -> 6282.12s]  I'm just going to wear it.
[6282.68s -> 6286.30s]  I thought it was going to be like toys.
[6287.54s -> 6288.26s]  All right.
[6288.26s -> 6288.98s]  Let's keep going.
[6288.98s -> 6290.42s]  What else is in the sack?
[6290.42s -> 6293.70s]  No.
[6293.70s -> 6295.62s]  There's nothing in the sack, Jeremy.
[6296.34s -> 6298.58s]  Just some Christmas spirit.
[6298.58s -> 6299.22s]  Here's my voice.
[6299.22s -> 6300.42s]  It's still like something high.
[6300.42s -> 6307.18s]  Is there anything else in there, Mr. Saka?
[6309.74s -> 6310.70s]  No, Jeremy.
[6310.70s -> 6313.11s]  Take a hear his Christmas spirit.
[6316.07s -> 6316.95s]  No, don't kiss him.
[6319.35s -> 6321.93s]  A bag gift.
[6322.65s -> 6324.50s]  A bag present.
[6327.90s -> 6328.54s]  What?
[6328.54s -> 6331.19s]  Why are you laughing so hard over there?
[6332.49s -> 6332.81s]  What?
[6334.82s -> 6336.90s]  He's laughing really hard.
[6336.98s -> 6340.28s]  I don't know why.
[6340.28s -> 6341.64s]  He's fucking cracking up.
[6342.28s -> 6344.92s]  And I can't figure it out for the life of me.
[6344.92s -> 6345.24s]  All right.
[6345.24s -> 6346.28s]  What do we got here?
[6346.28s -> 6348.52s]  Oh, hey, there's a turkey.
[6348.52s -> 6349.48s]  Oh, it's a seagull.
[6349.48s -> 6350.68s]  That's actually really nice.
[6350.68s -> 6351.72s]  Nice job, everybody.
[6351.72s -> 6356.60s]  Nice work.
[6356.60s -> 6357.16s]  Why?
[6357.16s -> 6358.44s]  Why is this so funny?
[6360.39s -> 6361.27s]  You can't hide it.
[6362.20s -> 6362.76s]  I will.
[6362.76s -> 6363.40s]  This is great.
[6363.40s -> 6364.12s]  I actually like this.
[6364.12s -> 6364.84s]  This is auto.
[6364.84s -> 6365.56s]  We'll play with this.
[6366.68s -> 6367.80s]  It's a nice seagull.
[6367.80s -> 6368.36s]  We've saved up.
[6368.36s -> 6368.60s]  You know what?
[6368.60s -> 6369.96s]  We saved up with 50,000 seagulls.
[6369.96s -> 6370.36s]  You know that?
[6371.24s -> 6372.62s]  He doesn't give a shit.
[6372.62s -> 6373.42s]  He's like laughing at it.
[6373.74s -> 6375.66s]  He put on a fucked up filter on my voice.
[6378.62s -> 6379.18s]  I guarantee you.
[6379.18s -> 6379.90s]  That's what happened, right?
[6396.47s -> 6397.03s]  What is this?
[6398.47s -> 6399.35s]  Is this for a baby?
[6401.86s -> 6402.74s]  Oh, I know.
[6402.74s -> 6404.26s]  I think this is a dog costume.
[6405.38s -> 6406.58s]  Is this a dog costume?
[6408.10s -> 6410.89s]  This is a Pepe the Frog dog costume.
[6412.73s -> 6414.09s]  Auto is not going to fit in this.
[6414.09s -> 6415.05s]  He's way too big.
[6416.33s -> 6417.77s]  Yeah, there's no way he's going to fit.
[6417.77s -> 6419.05s]  Maybe your dog can fit in this.
[6419.05s -> 6419.85s]  Hey, Merry Christmas.
[6419.85s -> 6420.73s]  I got you a gift for you.
[6421.61s -> 6424.17s]  Hey, you want a sex thing too?
[6425.13s -> 6425.77s]  Hey, heads up.
[6429.37s -> 6432.01s]  Okay, which one's the sex thing?
[6432.01s -> 6433.45s]  No, the frog is not here.
[6434.98s -> 6437.54s]  Hey, I just don't want to fuck up the computer.
[6437.54s -> 6439.38s]  All right, sex thing.
[6439.38s -> 6439.78s]  Never mind.
[6441.78s -> 6442.50s]  Anybody in there?
[6444.02s -> 6447.40s]  You know how much I'm a pain in the ass.
[6447.40s -> 6449.40s]  Let's try to get this fucking thing to work.
[6449.40s -> 6451.24s]  Oh, I went about to just put my hand through it.
[6455.11s -> 6456.79s]  This is officially licensed stuff.
[6456.79s -> 6457.29s]  Okay.
[6457.99s -> 6460.66s]  I thought this was some knockoff.
[6473.27s -> 6474.39s]  Oh, lunch meal.
[6474.39s -> 6475.27s]  Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[6475.27s -> 6478.07s]  Hey, man, I was originally going to write some dumb chat meme here,
[6478.07s -> 6479.11s]  but in the spirit of Christmas,
[6479.11s -> 6482.31s]  I'd be more incisive to say that you have the funniest guy on this platform
[6482.31s -> 6483.99s]  and that's all that's there.
[6483.99s -> 6487.75s]  Guess who got cut off by this fantastic HP computer.
[6488.71s -> 6490.81s]  Oh, let me get there with my...
[6492.25s -> 6494.97s]  Okay, you know like in Breaking Bad?
[6494.97s -> 6496.41s]  No, what's the Adam Sandlin movie?
[6497.05s -> 6499.11s]  Where the guy is like the fucking foot.
[6502.92s -> 6504.79s]  Funniest guy on the platform.
[6504.79s -> 6506.79s]  I'm sure half the times I've ever laughed my whole life
[6506.79s -> 6507.99s]  has been because of you.
[6507.99s -> 6509.19s]  You deserve all the support you get.
[6509.19s -> 6510.15s]  Man, cheers and happy holidays.

[6529.43s -> 6530.07s]  since high school.
[6530.07s -> 6531.43s]  Keep me an amazing hashtag charity.

[6549.99s -> 6550.71s]  I don't want to open that.
[6550.71s -> 6551.43s]  I'm not opening that one.
[6551.43s -> 6552.15s]  You can open that one.
[6552.95s -> 6556.07s]  I saw like a fucking bug, a scorpion, and I'm not touching it.
[6556.87s -> 6558.47s]  There's like a bug in that one.
[6558.47s -> 6559.67s]  I said no bugs.
[6559.67s -> 6561.35s]  I said no fucking live animals.
[6561.35s -> 6565.59s]  I said no fucking, I'm not, I saw the scorpion and I don't want to touch it.
[6566.23s -> 6567.27s]  Is there a scorpion in there?
[6572.31s -> 6573.91s]  You got to be, I don't want to fucking touch this.
[6573.91s -> 6579.83s]  Is there a fucking scorpion in here?
[6579.83s -> 6580.63s]  Glow in the dark.
[6581.43s -> 6583.67s]  Genuine giant wasp hornet.
[6584.55s -> 6590.84s]  I can't, I don't think I can fucking do it.
[6591.48s -> 6592.44s]  I'm not even kidding.
[6595.08s -> 6596.12s]  Is that coming up on screen?
[6597.88s -> 6598.84s]  Is this a real thing?
[6599.66s -> 6600.30s]  Is this for real?
[6601.98s -> 6603.64s]  Oh my fucking God.
[6603.64s -> 6604.60s]  I can't do it.
[6604.68s -> 6613.16s]  I, you do it.
[6617.96s -> 6619.00s]  I can't do it.
[6621.08s -> 6621.88s]  I can't do it.
[6622.52s -> 6623.16s]  Is that real?
[6626.20s -> 6627.64s]  Is that a real fucking thing?
[6630.47s -> 6633.11s]  Oh God, why would somebody want that in their house?
[6634.31s -> 6635.67s]  How are you, how are you touching that?
[6637.83s -> 6639.59s]  Don't open it, don't actually open it.
[6645.88s -> 6648.68s]  Hold on, it's an Angelina Jolie blood pendant?
[6649.56s -> 6650.20s]  Is it really?
[6655.85s -> 6664.39s]  It's a Billy Bob Thornton blood pendant thing.
[6669.51s -> 6676.84s]  Jesus Christ, how could you fucking, it's touching my face.
[6676.84s -> 6679.64s]  Hold on, wait, how do I put this on my neck?
[6680.28s -> 6685.59s]  Did they get like a, get a good view of that?
[6688.09s -> 6688.73s]  Fucked up.
[6693.98s -> 6694.54s]  That's real.
[6696.30s -> 6697.98s]  In you want it, it's genuine.
[6709.11s -> 6710.15s]  That's fucked up.
[6710.15s -> 6711.19s]  I can't fucking handle that.
[6712.71s -> 6714.31s]  I think breaks it, it's gonna get out.
[6714.31s -> 6715.59s]  It's gonna kill everybody.
[6718.65s -> 6719.61s]  That's it for the stocking.
[6720.25s -> 6721.53s]  I thought it was a scorpion.
[6727.00s -> 6727.64s]  All right, here we go.
[6727.64s -> 6728.12s]  What's this?
[6728.76s -> 6730.49s]  Thank you.
[6731.37s -> 6732.89s]  I was gonna buy these anyways.
[6732.89s -> 6734.81s]  These are Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
[6734.81s -> 6737.29s]  insulated hard spout cups.
[6738.09s -> 6739.05s]  These are sippy cups
[6739.85s -> 6741.45s]  because I spill things all the time
[6741.45s -> 6742.89s]  and it's not embarrassing.
[6744.58s -> 6745.54s]  Look, there's two here.
[6745.54s -> 6746.26s]  You can have one of these.
[6747.14s -> 6748.10s]  You know how many times you've,
[6748.10s -> 6750.34s]  how many times have you dropped like a coffee
[6751.14s -> 6751.78s]  on your desk?
[6752.82s -> 6753.14s]  Never.
[6758.33s -> 6758.81s]  Well, I have.
[6759.86s -> 6762.10s]  And this is, this prevents spills.
[6762.66s -> 6764.98s]  This stops bullshit from coming out of your glass.
[6765.54s -> 6767.46s]  You're not gonna, I will actually use these.
[6768.26s -> 6769.22s]  This is another one of those.
[6769.22s -> 6769.86s]  I'm not even kidding.
[6769.86s -> 6770.66s]  I gotta get out of here.
[6770.66s -> 6771.38s]  I gotta go.
[6771.38s -> 6772.50s]  This is one of those scenarios.
[6772.50s -> 6773.54s]  I'm gonna actually use these.
[6774.34s -> 6776.50s]  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sippy cups.
[6778.02s -> 6779.46s]  I put coffee in these.
[6779.46s -> 6780.10s]  Like, fuck it.
[6781.46s -> 6782.26s]  I'm keeping those.
[6783.38s -> 6784.26s]  All right, we got some more.
[6785.54s -> 6789.14s]  This is, oh, I hope it's supermodel.
[6789.22s -> 6801.61s]  Mario 64 is an exfoliating foot peel mask.
[6801.61s -> 6803.21s]  What's with you guys and like the feet?
[6803.77s -> 6805.45s]  There's like three feet gifts here.
[6806.17s -> 6808.90s]  I'm gonna give these to Kim.
[6808.90s -> 6810.42s]  Don't tell her because like this,
[6810.42s -> 6811.30s]  I'm gonna give this to her.
[6812.74s -> 6815.46s]  For soft, healthy feet, natural ingredients
[6815.46s -> 6816.74s]  and botanical extracts.
[6819.35s -> 6820.47s]  Get this off.
[6820.47s -> 6823.03s]  Seriously, I'm getting uncomfortable with that on.
[6824.95s -> 6827.03s]  But here's the, this is like a funny joke
[6827.03s -> 6827.75s]  to like some of you guys,
[6827.75s -> 6829.75s]  but Kim isn't gonna go nuts for this shit.
[6830.47s -> 6832.39s]  She is gonna be so happy that I have these.
[6833.43s -> 6836.79s]  Oh, that's great.
[6836.79s -> 6837.29s]  Hey.
[6837.91s -> 6838.55s]  Oh, Kim.
[6839.83s -> 6843.50s]  Hey, Merry Christmas.
[6843.50s -> 6844.30s]  I got you a gift.
[6846.86s -> 6847.36s]  Hey.
[6849.86s -> 6850.66s]  What's in this one?
[6851.38s -> 6853.14s]  This one makes noise.
[6865.16s -> 6866.20s]  Bean Boozled.
[6867.00s -> 6868.60s]  Naughty or Nice Jelly Beans.
[6870.55s -> 6872.31s]  No, I don't want to do a thing where like,
[6872.31s -> 6873.51s]  oh, he's a YouTuber.
[6873.51s -> 6874.95s]  He's gonna eat the fucking jelly beans
[6874.95s -> 6877.03s]  and they puke because it tastes like earwax.
[6877.83s -> 6882.68s]  Fine, I'll eat one.
[6882.68s -> 6883.88s]  These are gross jelly beans.
[6883.88s -> 6885.08s]  You spin a wheel and oh,
[6885.08s -> 6886.36s]  what kind of gross jelly beans
[6886.36s -> 6887.24s]  are you gonna eat tonight?
[6887.24s -> 6888.12s]  Fucking dude.
[6889.08s -> 6892.95s]  I'm just gonna pick one.
[6893.99s -> 6894.39s]  This one.
[6894.39s -> 6895.35s]  I don't even know what it is.
[6895.35s -> 6896.39s]  This is just kind of yellow.
[6900.78s -> 6902.74s]  Nope, I'm not gonna eat that.
[6903.70s -> 6904.34s]  Not gonna happen.
[6905.30s -> 6907.22s]  That tasted like somebody peed in my mouth.
[6907.22s -> 6908.74s]  So I'm not gonna eat it.
[6908.74s -> 6909.54s]  I'm gonna put it right here.
[6910.58s -> 6912.02s]  Hey, thanks for the funny thing.
[6912.02s -> 6912.58s]  What's this one?
[6912.58s -> 6913.86s]  This one's a little white with some yellow.
[6915.22s -> 6919.54s]  I think it's spoiled milk.
[6920.34s -> 6921.46s]  It sure does taste like it.
[6922.26s -> 6925.10s]  Or it might be rotten egg.
[6926.06s -> 6929.54s]  Whoa, what's this one?
[6929.54s -> 6930.42s]  This is dead fish.
[6930.42s -> 6932.18s]  If this is dead fish, I'll throw up ice cream.
[6932.18s -> 6932.74s]  You're gonna have to cut.
[6934.26s -> 6936.18s]  I know you're busy doing something,
[6936.18s -> 6937.70s]  but if this is rotten fish,
[6939.54s -> 6942.66s]  go to the last funny clips thing from last year.
[6949.82s -> 6950.78s]  Not that one either.
[6950.78s -> 6951.74s]  No, thanks for the gift.
[6952.54s -> 6954.52s]  Thank you for that.
[6954.52s -> 6957.64s]  Thanks for suggesting that I get that.
[6959.94s -> 6960.58s]  That was just like,
[6960.58s -> 6962.10s]  I just smelt sardines in my nose
[6962.10s -> 6963.14s]  and I couldn't fucking handle it.
[6964.26s -> 6965.54s]  No, that's it.
[6965.54s -> 6970.36s]  My, that's it.
[6970.36s -> 6974.50s]  Who would make money with this gift?
[6974.50s -> 6978.78s]  I put it on a stand.
[6978.78s -> 6980.06s]  Can you imagine selling a product?
[6987.11s -> 6988.07s]  I mean, I get it, right?
[6989.51s -> 6991.51s]  It's supposed to be fucking disgusting,
[6992.23s -> 6995.11s]  but why would you ever say,
[6995.11s -> 6996.47s]  oh, hey, yeah.
[6996.47s -> 6997.99s]  Just buy these dead fish
[6997.99s -> 7000.15s]  and battery acid jelly beans.
[7000.15s -> 7001.11s]  They're fucking delicious.
[7001.11s -> 7001.67s]  It's so funny.
[7001.67s -> 7003.35s]  You prank your friends, okay?
[7004.31s -> 7005.75s]  My friends don't think it's funny.
[7005.75s -> 7006.47s]  That's not funny.
[7007.67s -> 7009.43s]  It's just, it's just gross.
[7009.43s -> 7010.39s]  Oh, I'll spin the wheel.
[7010.39s -> 7011.11s]  Fine. One more time.
[7012.07s -> 7012.71s]  Everyone's probably like,
[7012.71s -> 7014.55s]  spin the wheel, you fucking wanker.
[7014.55s -> 7015.59s]  And I'm just like, fucking mate,

[7041.18s -> 7043.58s]  So this is supposed to be a booger.
[7043.58s -> 7044.94s]  Oh, I get it.
[7045.50s -> 7047.10s]  So each one of these could be
[7047.10s -> 7049.18s]  either a juicy pear or booger.
[7049.18s -> 7050.14s]  Let's see if this is booger.
[7052.30s -> 7056.63s]  I mean, pears kind of taste like boogers, so.
[7059.78s -> 7060.98s]  I eat boogers all the time.
[7060.98s -> 7061.78s]  So I know what it tastes like.
[7061.78s -> 7062.58s]  It tastes like kind of like,
[7062.58s -> 7063.86s]  sour and rotten pear.

[7471.38s -> 7471.88s]  Whatever.
[7473.06s -> 7475.14s]  Some library is gonna get that, okay?
[7475.14s -> 7476.82s]  Well, a local Las Vegas library.
[7476.82s -> 7478.58s]  I'm gonna donate that to a library.

[7525.24s -> 7527.72s]  and the first time in my life I wasn't excited for Christmas.
[7528.44s -> 7529.72s]  I want to thank you so much for the stream.
[7529.72s -> 7532.68s]  It made me excited and happy at Christmas again.

[7561.50s -> 7563.82s]  Hey, you want to eat a booger jolly bean?
[7566.26s -> 7567.86s]  You want to eat a booger jolly bean?
[7568.74s -> 7570.52s]  You want to puke on stream?
[7570.52s -> 7571.32s]  What do you think?
[7571.32s -> 7572.60s]  Why don't we both eat one?
[7572.60s -> 7573.10s]  Okay.
[7573.48s -> 7581.69s]  Come on, get over here, son.
[7582.49s -> 7587.42s]  All right, if you puke, your channel has to get banned
[7587.42s -> 7589.74s]  if Twitch staff is here.
[7590.30s -> 7592.46s]  That's twitch.tv slash Alex.
[7592.46s -> 7594.06s]  Ban him if he throws up on my stream.
[7594.86s -> 7597.58s]  All right, so this is birthday cake or dirty dishwasher.

[7619.90s -> 7620.84s]  Yeah, that was gross.
[7620.84s -> 7621.88s]  I'm out of here.
[7621.88s -> 7623.16s]  They're both dirty dishwasher.
[7623.16s -> 7623.66s]  Are they?
[7624.70s -> 7627.58s]  This is bad.
[7627.58s -> 7628.06s]  Is this okay?
[7628.06s -> 7629.26s]  It's like illegal to eat this.
[7630.52s -> 7631.72s]  Is it illegal to eat these?
[7643.00s -> 7644.36s]  No, I had some good ones.
[7653.02s -> 7653.58s]  Easy joke.
[7655.88s -> 7658.92s]  But seriously, but like really though,

[7665.88s -> 7668.28s]  What do you possibly put, where do you put that?
[7668.28s -> 7668.78s]  Sub sound.
[7669.48s -> 7670.98s]  That's not going to be, no,
[7670.98s -> 7672.50s]  I'm turning off sub sounds forever.
[7673.77s -> 7675.29s]  Is it like a funny joke version?
[7675.29s -> 7676.17s]  No, it's just nut.
[7680.30s -> 7681.42s]  Some things are worth a nut.
[7681.42s -> 7683.26s]  Here, you like these, have some.

[7698.33s -> 7698.81s]  Pacing?
[7698.81s -> 7700.09s]  We have to pace this production.
[7701.21s -> 7701.85s]  Why?
[7701.85s -> 7703.53s]  Because it's time for a little change.
[7705.69s -> 7718.82s]  Oh, it's the Lord of the Rings.
[7720.50s -> 7722.18s]  It's a Gandalf costume.
[7724.26s -> 7728.92s]  Hey, look at me.
[7730.28s -> 7735.82s]  All right, so thank you by the way.
[7741.94s -> 7743.86s]  Get this fucking Garfield thing off.
[7744.98s -> 7746.50s]  Do I have to wear the whole costume?
[7747.30s -> 7749.72s]  I have to put the entire Garfield costume on.
[7749.72s -> 7753.85s]  I mean, you know what?
[7753.85s -> 7755.85s]  This is actually, for all the shit I talked,
[7755.85s -> 7756.73s]  this is pretty comfortable.
[7757.93s -> 7759.85s]  I could see no one wearing this
[7759.85s -> 7761.77s]  and Jim Davis having a terrible creation
[7761.77s -> 7763.29s]  and the thing's not even funny.
[7763.29s -> 7765.21s]  And like after 1996,
[7765.21s -> 7766.81s]  they should have canceled the entire series
[7767.45s -> 7770.41s]  and there should never have been another book ever made.
[7770.41s -> 7772.17s]  And I don't know why it's an American icon.
[7772.49s -> 7775.53s]  But it's comfortable outerwear, I think.
[7778.17s -> 7779.29s]  All right, here's the frog soap.
[7779.29s -> 7781.29s]  Can't wait to fucking on that.
[7781.29s -> 7781.79s]  No.
[7783.69s -> 7789.26s]  Hey, Gandalf.
[7797.32s -> 7798.44s]  Define this one.
[7802.44s -> 7804.12s]  All right, do I have to put the whole thing on?
[7805.06s -> 7806.10s]  I shouldn't have to, right?
[7807.59s -> 7809.43s]  It's probably one piece.
[7810.23s -> 7812.23s]  Is it one gigantic piece?
[7812.23s -> 7814.63s]  How complicated do you think Gandalf's costume is?
[7815.03s -> 7819.19s]  I mean, it really is just like a big gray tablecloth.
[7819.99s -> 7821.03s]  Is this the beard?
[7821.03s -> 7821.99s]  Holy fuck.
[7821.99s -> 7823.35s]  Look at this terrible hat.
[7825.03s -> 7825.53s]  Wow.
[7828.31s -> 7829.75s]  Holy shit.
[7829.75s -> 7830.79s]  Is it inside out?
[7830.79s -> 7831.67s]  I feel like it is.
[7832.47s -> 7834.70s]  Did it come with a beard?
[7836.30s -> 7839.74s]  How am I supposed to put this on?
[7840.46s -> 7845.56s]  I'm like stepping in it.
[7845.56s -> 7847.00s]  I guess I'm gonna put it on like this.
[7850.71s -> 7851.83s]  Why Gandalf?
[7852.63s -> 7855.19s]  How many times have I ever talked about Gandalf on the stream?
[7855.91s -> 7857.75s]  Like maybe three times ever?
[7859.91s -> 7861.75s]  I'm surprised there's no hobbit costume.
[7861.75s -> 7864.15s]  Because like, oh LOL, he's got like his fucking feet.
[7864.15s -> 7865.11s]  He's got his small.
[7865.11s -> 7866.23s]  He's like five seven.
[7866.79s -> 7868.39s]  But you give me the Gandalf costume?
[7868.39s -> 7869.67s]  All right, that's fine.
[7869.67s -> 7872.07s]  That's the Gandalf costume from the hobbit.
[7873.11s -> 7877.18s]  Well, here's like the weird cigar that is his beard.
[7878.14s -> 7890.46s]  This is the beard.
[7890.46s -> 7893.11s]  It's like a fucking what?
[7893.11s -> 7894.87s]  It's like a lunch lady hair in it.
[7894.87s -> 7895.91s]  It's like a snake.
[7895.91s -> 7897.11s]  How is this a beard?
[7897.83s -> 7898.63s]  This is a beard.
[7899.19s -> 7900.07s]  This is the beard?
[7901.78s -> 7902.10s]  What?
[7903.56s -> 7908.25s]  Oh, it's a beard.
[7908.25s -> 7909.45s]  Where's the beard?
[7910.09s -> 7911.53s]  I don't understand where the beard is.
[7912.49s -> 7919.82s]  All right, when I say this, you gotta put on like a cool voice.
[7920.62s -> 7921.98s]  But wait till I get the whole thing on.
[7924.06s -> 7926.34s]  Okay, so where's the beard?
[7929.21s -> 7930.73s]  This costume didn't come with a beard.
[7931.37s -> 7933.00s]  Seriously.
[7933.64s -> 7934.52s]  Where's the fucking beard?
[7937.44s -> 7941.20s]  There's clearly a beard on that thumbnail thing.
[7942.88s -> 7945.28s]  Where's the beard?
[7945.28s -> 7950.97s]  Where's the fucking beard?
[7951.77s -> 7952.49s]  There's no beard.
[7953.53s -> 7958.33s]  What a scam.
[7958.33s -> 7958.97s]  There's no beard.
[7962.73s -> 7964.97s]  Was I supposed to buy a beard separately?
[7966.33s -> 7970.84s]  All right, put me on.
[7978.62s -> 7979.50s]  I gotta be honest with you.
[7979.50s -> 7981.82s]  You shall not pass, you fucking dingus.
[7983.18s -> 7985.02s]  Tell me when you're ready.
[7985.02s -> 7986.86s]  So I'm gonna say you.
[7986.86s -> 7988.14s]  You need to point at me when it's ready.
[7990.64s -> 7992.64s]  I still taste dishwasher soap.
[7993.76s -> 7994.08s]  Ready?
[7995.12s -> 7995.36s]  Okay.
[7996.72s -> 8000.96s]  You shall not pass.
[8000.96s -> 8012.91s]  Okay, there's no beard.
[8012.91s -> 8014.11s]  What a shitty costume.
[8015.45s -> 8017.45s]  That's the worst fucking costume I've ever seen.
[8019.05s -> 8019.85s]  Fuck that company.
[8019.85s -> 8021.05s]  Fuck the company that made this.
[8021.05s -> 8021.93s]  Fuck that whole company.
[8022.97s -> 8023.93s]  There's no beard.
[8023.93s -> 8027.05s]  Okay, this is just like dirty guy with a funny hat on.
[8027.85s -> 8028.57s]  There's no beard.
[8030.49s -> 8033.87s]  What's in here?
[8033.87s -> 8041.42s]  A piece of timer.
[8049.44s -> 8050.64s]  This is not a gift.
[8056.17s -> 8063.28s]  This is, this was supposed to be LED candles.
[8064.08s -> 8070.24s]  For when Bugleberry did his little thing.
[8071.45s -> 8072.33s]  It's a prop.
[8073.45s -> 8075.53s]  It's a prop that was supposed to,
[8075.53s -> 8079.05s]  and I was wondering where these were.
[8079.05s -> 8080.49s]  Remember I asked you specifically,
[8080.49s -> 8083.13s]  I was like, I think I'm missing a fucking package.
[8083.13s -> 8085.05s]  So was your two presents.
[8086.81s -> 8087.69s]  That's one.
[8087.69s -> 8089.77s]  These were supposed to be scattered around
[8089.77s -> 8091.29s]  and I didn't know where they were
[8091.29s -> 8093.13s]  and I think Kim accidentally may have
[8093.93s -> 8094.73s]  packaged them up.
[8097.69s -> 8099.37s]  And there's like somebody's card in here.
[8100.89s -> 8103.45s]  Okay, because I was wondering where the fuck these went.
[8103.45s -> 8104.81s]  All right, well, that's great.
[8104.81s -> 8108.01s]  Thank you, me, for buying a prop that never got used
[8108.65s -> 8110.65s]  and was accidentally wrapped up, apparently.
[8112.33s -> 8118.27s]  Hey, there's another one.
[8118.27s -> 8119.71s]  Who is this from?
[8119.71s -> 8120.27s]  The Mods?
[8121.55s -> 8122.05s]  Chat?
[8122.67s -> 8128.94s]  Are we sure there's another beard lying around here somewhere?
[8130.22s -> 8131.31s]  Give me yours.
[8131.31s -> 8132.27s]  Just like cut yours off.
[8133.47s -> 8135.45s]  All right, what's in this one?
[8135.45s -> 8136.01s]  Let's see.
[8137.77s -> 8147.18s]  It's more, it's more bananas.
[8147.18s -> 8148.62s]  It's more you're the top banana.
[8150.11s -> 8151.07s]  How did this get through?
[8151.71s -> 8152.83s]  A second gift.
[8152.83s -> 8156.03s]  A second you're the top banana.
[8160.01s -> 8161.37s]  That's not even funny.
[8161.37s -> 8163.61s]  I think he went two boxes
[8163.61s -> 8165.53s]  and she just wrapped them separately.
[8166.33s -> 8168.01s]  It's the same gift.
[8168.01s -> 8170.09s]  So we're missing three gifts.
[8171.05s -> 8171.93s]  Where did they go?
[8172.65s -> 8173.21s]  I don't know.
[8174.01s -> 8178.65s]  So these are supposed to be in one, in one package.
[8180.17s -> 8182.57s]  And she wrapped them in, okay.
[8184.57s -> 8185.77s]  It was the same order.
[8185.77s -> 8186.73s]  It's the same order.
[8188.17s -> 8189.37s]  Well, there's like 50.
[8189.37s -> 8192.09s]  They sell them in multiple boxes.
[8192.09s -> 8192.57s]  Let me, let me, oh.
[8193.77s -> 8198.80s]  Did they do anything?
[8198.80s -> 8199.84s]  Did these do anything?
[8200.40s -> 8201.28s]  Did they do anything?
[8201.28s -> 8203.12s]  They're just plastic bananas.
[8203.12s -> 8204.32s]  What a waste of time.
[8204.56s -> 8205.44s]  The smiley face.
[8206.48s -> 8207.44s]  Look at that face.
[8207.44s -> 8208.08s]  You could, okay.
[8208.08s -> 8210.40s]  You could seriously like give these to people on the street
[8210.40s -> 8211.60s]  and be like, hey, let me tell you something.
[8212.24s -> 8213.52s]  You're the top banana.
[8213.52s -> 8214.56s]  I got so many of these.
[8215.52s -> 8220.20s]  What am I going to do with this shit?
[8220.20s -> 8220.84s]  What a joke.
[8221.56s -> 8223.64s]  All right, well more top bananas.
[8223.64s -> 8225.56s]  I'm not sure how that happened.
[8225.56s -> 8233.66s]  I thought I had the dad dick on still.
[8234.30s -> 8235.34s]  What's this even for?
[8235.34s -> 8235.84s]  I thought.
[8244.51s -> 8249.93s]  Got it.
[8249.93s -> 8257.95s]  Oh, this is a magic science for wizards only.
[8257.95s -> 8259.55s]  I think I fit that category now.
[8259.55s -> 8261.79s]  Magic science for wizards only.
[8264.27s -> 8264.83s]  Nice.
[8264.83s -> 8265.33s]  Okay.
[8266.59s -> 8268.51s]  Cast color changing spells.
[8272.59s -> 8274.88s]  Is it, can I, can I try one?
[8275.52s -> 8276.24s]  Is it elaborate?
[8276.24s -> 8277.84s]  If it's elaborate, I'm going to donate it.
[8279.18s -> 8281.58s]  It goes into donation if it's like elaborate and fun.
[8283.13s -> 8286.81s]  If it's a Gandalf costume with no beard, it stays on my body.
[8287.85s -> 8294.68s]  That looks pretty fucking elaborate.
[8296.28s -> 8297.16s]  Have fun with that.
[8297.96s -> 8298.46s]  Son.
[8299.80s -> 8300.30s]  Okay.
[8301.16s -> 8302.20s]  Magic science.
[8304.46s -> 8307.82s]  It's like sorbitol and food coloring.
[8314.89s -> 8315.53s]  What's that for?
[8317.69s -> 8318.25s]  I'm not sure.
[8319.29s -> 8320.01s]  That's it.
[8320.01s -> 8320.57s]  This is cool.
[8320.57s -> 8321.61s]  Magic science kit.
[8325.26s -> 8326.70s]  Have fun with that.
[8326.70s -> 8327.66s]  Somebody's going to get that.
[8327.66s -> 8329.18s]  They're going to have a fucking blast.
[8329.74s -> 8330.46s]  They're going to make like.
[8331.10s -> 8335.42s]  I just kind of spit on it though.
[8335.42s -> 8336.14s]  Like I'm sorry.
[8336.78s -> 8338.14s]  And I fucking packaged it wrong.
[8338.14s -> 8338.70s]  I'll fix it.
[8338.70s -> 8339.20s]  Don't worry.
[8339.98s -> 8343.90s]  I can't use that right now because I'll be in big fucking trouble.
[8343.90s -> 8348.38s]  Thank you for the magic science kit to make potions and brain fluids.
[8350.35s -> 8351.15s]  Sounds fucking cool.
[8352.99s -> 8353.87s]  Just put these around.
[8353.87s -> 8354.27s]  Why not?
[8354.91s -> 8357.15s]  I was actually fucking looking for these too.
[8357.15s -> 8358.11s]  Like that's so stupid.
[8359.31s -> 8359.63s]  All right.
[8359.63s -> 8361.31s]  We got like seven or eight more.
[8374.40s -> 8379.28s]  One size fits most of those battery operated fan inflates costume.
[8380.08s -> 8382.33s]  This is an inflatable costume.
[8385.93s -> 8387.69s]  It's an inflatable frog.
[8387.69s -> 8388.49s]  All right.
[8388.49s -> 8390.57s]  Hey Gandalf go fuck yourself.
[8390.57s -> 8392.25s]  Your last three movies weren't even good.
[8395.84s -> 8396.72s]  They were good.
[8397.28s -> 8398.16s]  Did you like the Hobbit?
[8401.12s -> 8403.36s]  I mean the Hobbit was all right but like it wasn't as good as
[8404.00s -> 8407.68s]  Gandalf which is the number two one.
[8408.96s -> 8410.83s]  All right.
[8410.83s -> 8413.07s]  Let's put on the frog inflatable and then you have to.
[8413.07s -> 8414.11s]  I'm going to body slam me.
[8417.07s -> 8419.08s]  You have to fight me in the frog costume.
[8420.36s -> 8421.80s]  I'm going to one punch man you.
[8421.80s -> 8422.92s]  Remember that fucking anime?
[8425.64s -> 8429.66s]  I got batteries though.

[8431.42s -> 8433.15s]  This instructions.
[8433.95s -> 8435.39s]  Oh Jesus Christ.
[8435.39s -> 8437.95s]  Body socks fancy dress.
[8437.95s -> 8439.48s]  All right.
[8439.48s -> 8440.28s]  What are the instructions?
[8441.48s -> 8442.28s]  They're in Chinese.
[8446.86s -> 8447.26s]  Wait.
[8447.26s -> 8447.66s]  All right.
[8447.66s -> 8448.06s]  Wait.

[8467.52s -> 8473.18s]  How do I get in here?
[8475.08s -> 8475.96s]  How do I get in here?
[8476.76s -> 8483.32s]  How am I supposed to get inside of this like a zipper?
[8490.01s -> 8490.33s]  All right.
[8490.33s -> 8492.33s]  I need where's the battery?
[8492.89s -> 8494.17s]  I got like double A batteries.

[8520.11s -> 8533.76s]  So it's all my fucking fault then.
[8534.48s -> 8657.18s]  I feel like they're over here.
[8665.66s -> 8667.10s]  Where did I put the batteries?
[8673.93s -> 8675.77s]  Where are the batteries?
[8675.77s -> 8683.39s]  I brought so many batteries and they're gone forever.
[8683.39s -> 8685.63s]  I got plenty of banana fucking toys.
[8693.53s -> 8693.93s]  They go.
[8694.57s -> 8697.63s]  Oh you're gonna knock the tree over.
[8706.33s -> 8707.45s]  Do you have any idea where the batteries are?
[8712.99s -> 8713.31s]  Where?
[8718.49s -> 8719.53s]  Where are they?
[8719.53s -> 8720.49s]  I don't know.
[8720.49s -> 8722.25s]  Oh I thought you just said you knew where they were.
[8730.32s -> 8731.04s]  God.
[8731.04s -> 8732.62s]  Stay over there.

[8826.48s -> 8828.08s]  Where the fuck are those batteries?
[8828.72s -> 8830.88s]  So it's all my fucking fault then.
[8830.88s -> 8831.68s]  You fucking.
[8832.64s -> 8833.60s]  Oh you fucking.

[8834.56s -> 8835.92s]  You're gonna throw me to fucking.
[8835.92s -> 8837.68s]  You know I didn't have a goddamn choice.

[8845.39s -> 8846.35s]  Fucking bullshit.
[8846.35s -> 8846.91s]  Tell it again.
[8846.91s -> 8847.55s]  Tell it again.
[8847.55s -> 8847.79s]  Tell it.
[8847.79s -> 8848.11s]  Listen.
[8848.11s -> 8849.87s]  I've told the story like four times.
[8850.43s -> 8853.47s]  Just please let me be the example for this okay?
[8854.67s -> 8856.91s]  Stay the fuck away from yard tools.
[8856.91s -> 8858.19s]  Don't touch anything dangerous.
[8858.19s -> 8859.39s]  Don't like rake your leaves.
[8859.39s -> 8860.27s]  You're gonna like.
[8860.27s -> 8863.71s]  And then all of a sudden you got $1400 worth of dentistry work.
[8863.71s -> 8864.67s]  Actually can't beat him.
[8866.03s -> 8867.39s]  He swings way too weirdly.
[8868.75s -> 8871.55s]  And I can't even get the correct controls right.
[8871.55s -> 8872.75s]  Shouldn't do r2 twice.
[8872.75s -> 8874.11s]  Don't even think about it.
[8875.23s -> 8876.03s]  All right.
[8876.03s -> 8876.83s]  No no no no no.

[8900.01s -> 8901.23s]  I got it.

[8911.55s -> 8912.59s]  It's fucking what a waste of time.
[8912.59s -> 8913.15s]  He's a double.
[8913.15s -> 8914.27s]  Triple a and I need double a.
[8916.30s -> 8917.74s]  Bring like a whole box of that.
[8917.74s -> 8919.34s]  I brought a box of them.
[8919.50s -> 8921.10s]  And I don't know what the fuck they are.
[8924.30s -> 8925.50s]  What is it here?
[8925.50s -> 8927.36s]  It's a triple a.
[8927.36s -> 8928.88s]  It's a nothing.
[8928.88s -> 8929.84s]  Where are the batteries?
[8932.25s -> 8933.13s]  They're in this bag.
[8950.78s -> 8954.09s]  Oh god.
[8964.76s -> 8970.25s]  Are they over here?
[8970.25s -> 8972.51s]  What's over here?
[8972.51s -> 8975.85s]  Oh for the love of god.
[8977.21s -> 8977.53s]  Fuck.
[8982.41s -> 8984.09s]  Where are these batteries?
[8984.81s -> 8986.17s]  I'm going to lose my mind.
[8994.88s -> 8995.12s]  Shit.
[8999.13s -> 9000.57s]  They're in a ziplock bag.
[9001.93s -> 9009.05s]  Does anybody see these fucking things?
[9012.14s -> 9012.94s]  God damn it.
[9013.74s -> 9016.75s]  Like there's so much shit over here.
[9016.75s -> 9035.60s]  If I don't know where they are.
[9035.60s -> 9036.40s]  They're gone.
[9036.40s -> 9037.68s]  They're just apparently they're gone.
[9048.24s -> 9049.84s]  All right I'll put I'll put it on later.
[9049.84s -> 9050.72s]  I'll try to find it later.
[9050.72s -> 9051.36s]  Next present.
[9051.36s -> 9053.04s]  Thank you for the next gift by the way.
[9054.41s -> 9063.88s]  Thank you for uh this is this giant home.
[9069.42s -> 9071.42s]  An Ottoman alone.
[9071.42s -> 9074.46s]  What on earth?
[9075.79s -> 9077.15s]  I mean this is cool but
[9082.56s -> 9084.32s]  I've actually seen videos of this thing I think.
[9085.04s -> 9091.79s]  This is actually really fucking awesome.
[9091.79s -> 9092.75s]  All right hold on.
[9092.75s -> 9110.96s]  Where is in that one?
[9110.96s -> 9124.84s]  I don't see anything.
[9125.96s -> 9127.16s]  Next to your left leg.
[9130.09s -> 9131.21s]  I see a spider.
[9131.21s -> 9134.60s]  Your left thigh.
[9134.60s -> 9136.36s]  I need to open this with a screwdriver.
[9140.30s -> 9141.90s]  Fucking screwdriver man.
[9141.90s -> 9147.02s]  I bought like a pack of triple A's and a pack of double A's for this exact.
[9149.40s -> 9150.04s]  I see three.
[9150.84s -> 9153.79s]  Can you find me one double A battery?
[9153.79s -> 9154.67s]  Find it for me.
[9154.67s -> 9155.63s]  Double or triple?
[9155.63s -> 9156.83s]  Find me a double A battery.
[9159.96s -> 9161.72s]  I can't fucking open this thing with this.
[9162.99s -> 9164.03s]  Where the hell am I real?
[9164.67s -> 9180.68s]  Oh damn it.
[9182.52s -> 9183.56s]  Screws.
[9183.56s -> 9187.05s]  Why does everyone have to have a bunch of screws?
[9192.76s -> 9193.48s]  Fuck.
[9193.48s -> 9194.76s]  I need to turn the lights on.
[9194.76s -> 9250.60s]  You want them on either of them.
[9250.60s -> 9252.44s]  Series where I play Minecraft.
[9252.44s -> 9255.16s]  This is going to be a single player let's play.
[9255.16s -> 9261.40s]  And when I say let's play I use that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game.
[9261.40s -> 9262.60s]  You're going to see lots of fails.
[9262.60s -> 9264.60s]  You're going to see lots of triumphs.
[9264.60s -> 9265.80s]  At least I'm hoping.
[9265.88s -> 9268.12s]  So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee.
[9268.12s -> 9269.40s]  Hot cup of cocoa.
[9269.40s -> 9271.48s]  I got apple cider right here freshly brewed.
[9271.48s -> 9273.76s]  Let me take a sip.
[9273.76s -> 9275.12s]  Ah that's good cider.
[9276.67s -> 9279.23s]  All right so let's get this started.
[9279.23s -> 9280.35s]  Create new world.
[9281.39s -> 9285.74s]  World name is going to be Germacraft.
[9286.38s -> 9287.76s]  Sounds about right.
[9287.76s -> 9289.10s]  Yeah okay.
[9289.10s -> 9291.98s]  Game mode is going to be Survival.
[9291.98s -> 9293.26s]  That's the most interesting I think.
[9294.14s -> 9295.26s]  More world options.
[9295.26s -> 9296.38s]  Seed for world generator.
[9296.38s -> 9297.42s]  Okay this is important.
[9298.06s -> 9301.34s]  I got to name this something crazy to get cool.
[9304.62s -> 9307.52s]  It's not Germacraft unless you have something crazy happen.
[9307.52s -> 9309.44s]  So I'm going to go fight this asshole over here.
[9310.24s -> 9312.59s]  Look at this cows too.
[9312.59s -> 9314.51s]  Do I have I don't have a sword.
[9315.31s -> 9316.59s]  This is going to be interesting.
[9317.88s -> 9319.00s]  I should have just made one.
[9319.00s -> 9320.28s]  I should have just made a sword.
[9320.28s -> 9321.48s]  What am I doing?
[9321.48s -> 9322.84s]  Why am I doing this?
[9322.84s -> 9325.48s]  Why am I going after this guy right now?
[9325.48s -> 9326.60s]  What does the matter with me?
[9328.04s -> 9329.24s]  Actually play this game.
[9330.78s -> 9333.34s]  I just I'm just using my walls.
[9334.30s -> 9336.56s]  Oh yeah that's fine.
[9336.56s -> 9339.28s]  I'm just going to tear down my own walls to get wood.
[9340.24s -> 9343.04s]  That's right.
[9343.04s -> 9345.85s]  Yeah let there be light.
[9345.85s -> 9349.52s]  Aim up.
[9349.52s -> 9353.05s]  Always cut down the whole tree or else it won't disappear.
[9354.09s -> 9356.11s]  That's what grandpa told me.
[9357.55s -> 9360.70s]  Look at that beautiful moon.
[9360.70s -> 9361.34s]  So elegant.
[9364.25s -> 9365.69s]  Okay so I got that wood.
[9365.69s -> 9366.57s]  Let's do something with it.
[9368.33s -> 9371.31s]  Make it into a bunch of things.
[9373.50s -> 9374.06s]  Shift click.
[9375.55s -> 9379.55s]  I promise this is not going to be this much of a mess through the whole series.
[9381.55s -> 9384.67s]  And if it is then whoops.
[9393.53s -> 9396.33s]  Welcome to another episode of JermaCraft.
[9397.29s -> 9399.45s]  And as you can see I'm doing a little bit of renovating.
[9400.01s -> 9404.00s]  Doing some renovations on the house if you could tell.
[9405.36s -> 9406.56s]  Because this thing is a mess.
[9406.56s -> 9407.84s]  Just trying to clean it up a little bit.
[9408.40s -> 9411.28s]  And oh my god no this has happened before.
[9412.16s -> 9412.72s]  Don't worry.
[9413.60s -> 9415.20s]  Keep going below with the coal.
[9417.12s -> 9417.84s]  Mine is steel.
[9419.68s -> 9420.40s]  Mine is steel.
[9422.30s -> 9425.34s]  We got a man at steel and man at cobblestone.
[9427.13s -> 9428.65s]  Where the hell am I even going?
[9429.29s -> 9432.01s]  All right let's go.
[9432.01s -> 9435.37s]  I will find something before this pick breaks.
[9436.01s -> 9437.92s]  Or it was it'll kill me.
[9440.25s -> 9453.92s]  Oh yeah aimlessly digging around.
[9454.96s -> 9456.24s]  Best part about Minecraft.
[9458.83s -> 9459.23s]  Torch.
[9465.66s -> 9466.94s]  Oh we found a little bit of coal.
[9496.22s -> 9506.80s]  Did I get the wrong way?
[9507.36s -> 9533.23s]  All right you gotta come zip me.
[9533.23s -> 9542.51s]  You gotta zip me.
[9542.51s -> 9547.85s]  Does this go inside?
[9548.41s -> 9554.56s]  All right zip it up.
[9554.56s -> 9556.91s]  Is it doing it?
[9556.91s -> 9559.95s]  It's all the way from the track.
[9559.95s -> 9560.67s]  You gotta start.
[9577.24s -> 9577.88s]  It's caught.
[9577.88s -> 9578.68s]  You have to do it.
[9580.43s -> 9580.99s]  It's caught.
[9594.80s -> 9595.92s]  It is caught.
[9595.92s -> 9596.48s]  It's caught.
[9597.12s -> 9599.16s]  You got it?
[9599.16s -> 9601.71s]  No the zipper's stuck.
[9602.43s -> 9635.80s]  Okay what's left?
[9635.80s -> 9649.47s]  Oh thanks man.
[9650.11s -> 9652.11s]  Thanks for the iPhone charger.
[9652.83s -> 9653.31s]  Sick.
[9653.95s -> 9664.94s]  I thought this was a friend.
[9664.94s -> 9665.82s]  Oh no.
[9668.70s -> 9671.98s]  I can't see in this fucking mask.
[9673.18s -> 9674.30s]  You don't even have to head off.
[9675.66s -> 9681.28s]  This is very disorienting.
[9681.28s -> 9681.92s]  What?
[9681.92s -> 9683.04s]  What are you gonna have?
[9683.04s -> 9683.44s]  Hold on.
[9683.44s -> 9685.36s]  I'm gonna have to pull against your neck.
[9685.36s -> 9686.00s]  All right do it.
[9688.00s -> 9692.38s]  Eat your own hand up.
[9692.38s -> 9693.34s]  I don't want these.
[9694.14s -> 9695.10s]  Don't drop them.
[9695.10s -> 9696.30s]  Pull that thing over your head.
[9696.86s -> 9697.50s]  It's in the back.
[9698.06s -> 9698.78s]  All the way at the back.
[9701.55s -> 9701.87s]  What?
[9701.87s -> 9702.75s]  No no no.
[9702.75s -> 9702.99s]  Here.

[9705.15s -> 9705.79s]  Grab here.
[9706.99s -> 9708.91s]  Right there and pull that thing over your head.
[9709.55s -> 9711.60s]  No no no it doesn't work like that.
[9711.60s -> 9712.48s]  It's like a double.
[9713.60s -> 9715.20s]  There's like frog eyes up there.
[9716.24s -> 9717.92s]  I can't see anything with this.
[9717.92s -> 9719.28s]  This is bouncy balls.
[9719.28s -> 9719.92s]  Uh cool.
[9721.20s -> 9722.24s]  I'm gonna donate these.
[9723.20s -> 9728.48s]  I can't fucking believe these all fell out.
[9729.04s -> 9730.24s]  Oh god damn it.
[9734.35s -> 9741.40s]  Stilts have screws.
[9741.40s -> 9744.41s]  This is the last part of them.
[9749.52s -> 9751.20s]  This is vibrating my ass.
[9752.08s -> 9753.98s]  This is the last one.
[9757.45s -> 9760.49s]  Oh and it is the best one by far.
[9762.72s -> 9764.08s]  Absolutely best one by far.
[9764.08s -> 9765.36s]  This is shot water tapping.
[9766.00s -> 9772.78s]  This is like the only thing I wanted for Christmas.
[9772.78s -> 9773.58s]  Seriously.
[9773.58s -> 9775.66s]  This is the only thing that I wanted.
[9780.76s -> 9781.00s]  What?
[9781.88s -> 9791.92s]  Does that work?
[9791.92s -> 9794.68s]  It looks like you've put something up.
[9794.68s -> 9799.80s]  This is the this is the best gift to do last year.
[9799.80s -> 9802.28s]  You look like scuffed Yoshi.
[9803.72s -> 9804.22s]  Yoshi!
[9805.16s -> 9805.66s]  Brrring!
[9806.12s -> 9806.86s]  Brrring!
[9821.24s -> 9825.15s]  Is that it?
[9825.15s -> 9830.48s]  I can't open this because I don't have the thing.
[9830.48s -> 9832.32s]  I don't have the I don't have a screwdriver.
[9838.52s -> 9839.08s]  Is that it?
[9839.64s -> 9840.28s]  Is that right?
[9841.60s -> 9842.40s]  Thanks for the tip.
[9843.20s -> 9854.04s]  Why would anybody fucking wear this for more than five seconds?
[9855.56s -> 9857.48s]  I I actually can't get out of here.
[9858.28s -> 9862.73s]  Listen the stilts have screws, Jack.

[9896.04s -> 9898.84s]  Uh wait I forgot the Pepe the Frog fucking gloves.
[9899.80s -> 9904.67s]  The pens were uh we'll never have to buy another pen forever in the rest of our lives.
[9906.19s -> 9907.79s]  What do these go on your hands?
[9907.79s -> 9913.08s]  Oh right the gloves like this.
[9916.56s -> 9917.06s]  What?
[9918.83s -> 9919.87s]  This is fucking stupid.
