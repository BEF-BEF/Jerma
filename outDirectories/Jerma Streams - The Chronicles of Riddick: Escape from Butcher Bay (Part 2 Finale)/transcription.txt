[1.78s -> 5.22s]  I hadn't even been in 10 sec, people are already punching me. Did you see that?
[5.22s -> 12.42s]  I turn the stream on, I just see, get him, and people punching.
[12.42s -> 17.72s]  How you doing guys? Welcome back. Welcome to part two
[17.72s -> 24.81s]  of the Chronicles of Riddick Escape from Butcher's Bay.
[24.81s -> 29.18s]  This is a two-part series. I plan on finishing this tonight. I think we're
[29.18s -> 33.58s]  fairly close to... somebody said I'm more than halfway
[33.58s -> 37.43s]  through the game. Uh, probably like 60% of the way through
[37.43s -> 42.65s]  the game. Probably have another three or four hours. Freddy Dread coming in
[42.65s -> 47.86s]  with 50 community subs. Just, he just throws rocks full of money.
[47.86s -> 53.80s]  He just throws eggs filled with money, not egg yolk, at the stream.
[53.80s -> 59.27s]  It's a lot. Freddy, you continue to fucking... Freddy,
[59.27s -> 64.95s]  Freddy sometimes comes to Vegas. Like, Freddy, if we go out somewhere,
[64.95s -> 69.45s]  if like we hang out, if you come to Vegas eventually, like,
[69.45s -> 78.04s]  like, don't, you ain't buying shit, okay? Like, if we go to... I'm not, and I'll
[78.04s -> 81.51s]  tell you this, I will take you to Denny's and out,
[81.51s -> 86.15s]  you can get anything you want on the Denny's menu, I promise you that.
[86.15s -> 89.51s]  At least twice. We'll go to Denny's twice, and you can get anything on the whole
[89.51s -> 96.22s]  menu. He's already paid for it all. You already
[96.22s -> 99.98s]  paid for it all a hundred times. He could, he could probably
[99.98s -> 108.94s]  own the franchise of this Denny's that I'm talking about.
[108.94s -> 113.74s]  No, but seriously, dude, you, you, you've gone above and beyond what anyone would
[113.74s -> 118.50s]  ever be expected to give a single person on the internet any amount of money.
[118.50s -> 126.39s]  Like, times of million. So, thanks. And if you ever come to Vegas,
[126.39s -> 131.51s]  that offer stands.
[131.51s -> 137.98s]  You're my, I shaved my head. All right, well, it's hot out. That's not a bad idea.
[137.98s -> 148.50s]  Get him. Uh, Grove Coaster just gave a hundred and forty-five dollars.
[148.50s -> 154.66s]  Not, not for Freddy to be, to be a hundred and forty-five dollars in bits.
[154.66s -> 159.46s]  What are you doing? That's a lot of money. That's too much money.
[159.46s -> 162.50s]  And they, they just said, I defended my master thesis
[162.50s -> 168.25s]  fifteen minutes ago. Thanks for being here. Like, like a debate?
[168.25s -> 174.38s]  Holy shit. That's a lot of money. Thank you. Did I change my microphone?
[174.38s -> 179.34s]  No, I sound weird. I shouldn't. Unless I fucked something up.
[179.34s -> 184.74s]  The microphone's closer to my mouth. So, I mean, do I sound like I'm too close to
[184.74s -> 187.74s]  you? Do I sound like I'm way too close to you?
[187.74s -> 196.46s]  Should I back up a little? Did you get the standing desk? No, I
[196.46s -> 201.11s]  didn't. I did not. Here's my problem with the
[201.11s -> 205.32s]  standing desk. So, last year or like a year and a half
[205.32s -> 209.48s]  ago, I got this really nice, you've seen it, the, my
[209.48s -> 214.98s]  like nice walnut desk. And this thing was kind of expensive
[214.98s -> 218.81s]  and I want to use it, but so it just sucks where it's like, oh,
[218.81s -> 223.24s]  well, shit, what do I do with this? What can I put this somewhere else? I have to
[223.24s -> 233.53s]  get like a whole new desk now. Yeah, let's get it as a second desk. So,
[233.53s -> 236.01s]  the idea is, me and Kim were talking about it and I'm
[236.01s -> 241.77s]  probably gonna move this one out in a space where she could kind of
[241.77s -> 245.05s]  use it as a little, like, area where she can do some work
[245.13s -> 248.09s]  and stuff. So, that's probably the plan and I'm gonna get a standing desk.
[248.09s -> 255.14s]  You don't need a standing desk, just get up occasionally. Yeah, but I, you know me.
[255.14s -> 258.42s]  I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna be sitting here just fucking screaming at a
[258.42s -> 262.98s]  2004, like, 10-year-old video game. I'm not, I'm not gonna remember to, like,
[262.98s -> 266.10s]  stand up every 15 minutes and I don't want to, like, just
[266.10s -> 269.70s]  have that in the back of my mind. Stand up every 20 minutes, stand up every 20
[269.70s -> 271.30s]  minutes, I won't, it's just gonna fuck me up.
[271.30s -> 277.32s]  So, I might as well just stand the whole time. 2004 was 16 years ago.
[277.32s -> 280.68s]  I don't even, let me say these things. It's,
[280.68s -> 287.05s]  I know. All right, does anybody here feel like,
[287.05s -> 293.88s]  that every year has been, like, 2015? Like, it's just 20, like, it's just 2013
[293.88s -> 300.68s]  every year, right? I just feel like it's 2013.
[300.68s -> 305.62s]  This, we've not gone past it. The world is passing me by
[305.62s -> 316.57s]  and I'm just in 2013. Like, I just uploaded, like, Dramarumble 3. No, that was
[316.57s -> 327.13s]  fucking seven years ago. That's so much time.
[327.13s -> 330.57s]  How many, that's how, that so much time has passed
[330.57s -> 335.14s]  in seven years. What happened, what have I been doing? Have I, have I, okay, let me
[335.14s -> 337.70s]  ask you this. Have I, like, have I done anything in seven
[337.70s -> 346.20s]  years? I think I have. I feel like I've done a lot of things.
[346.20s -> 351.99s]  Yeah, I think I have, maybe. A little. I did the carnival.
[351.99s -> 361.85s]  Well, yeah, that was cool. Oh, yeah. Also, this is going to be an
[361.85s -> 364.57s]  interesting stream because I just realized something.
[364.57s -> 367.77s]  So, I woke up a little bit tight this morning and
[367.77s -> 372.89s]  I, I did, I took a, I took a little bit of tips of pain reducing potentials
[372.89s -> 378.02s]  CBD and this might be a CBD stream. I just want to make that very clear so
[378.02s -> 380.26s]  people don't yell at me when I can't open the door
[380.26s -> 385.13s]  for, like, the third time in a row. I was, I didn't want to cancel the stream
[385.13s -> 387.69s]  because I want to obviously finish this and I want to play and I want to stream
[387.69s -> 391.29s]  so I, you know, it's legal in the, in the United
[391.29s -> 395.93s]  States of Las Vegas where I am here and in this, in this area and I
[395.93s -> 401.00s]  am all right. Didn't, I took just a little bit so
[401.00s -> 405.61s]  I took, I take it for pain. Those of you that don't know.
[405.61s -> 414.01s]  Washed up drug streamer. Like, like, three milligrams of CBD and THC
[414.01s -> 420.47s]  for pain. I do not put that in that category, okay?
[420.47s -> 424.89s]  Anyways, we're gonna play This is Butcher's Bay. He's got wicked low
[424.89s -> 435.67s]  weed tolerance. By the way, why is that a bad thing?
[435.67s -> 438.79s]  You, you do realize that being able to, like, feel
[438.79s -> 445.14s]  better and feel good at, like, three to four milligrams?
[445.14s -> 449.38s]  I know some people that, like, are, like, they, they're, like, fucking doing, like,
[449.38s -> 453.11s]  20, 15 and they built up such a tolerance. That,
[453.11s -> 456.63s]  that's an expensive tolerance. Low tolerance, inexpensive is what you meant
[456.63s -> 464.73s]  to say. Remember, the gateway from CBD is to CBT.
[464.73s -> 468.46s]  Read that one out loud. Good. Pick them, pick that one
[468.46s -> 480.14s]  to read. It's only been eight minutes. Joe Rogan. No, I,
[480.14s -> 482.78s]  all right, I shouldn't have even said anything, but, like, I, it's almost like I
[482.78s -> 485.98s]  have to, like, preliminarily defend myself
[485.98s -> 488.94s]  when I, like, make a bunch of mistakes in the game. But, like, that doesn't matter
[488.94s -> 492.30s]  because I do that anyways. So, it's, it's just gonna be a regular
[492.30s -> 495.34s]  ass Jeremy stream, right? Like, I'm not gonna be able to remember
[495.34s -> 499.02s]  where the door is and I'm trying to, like, give, like, a thing to blame.
[499.02s -> 503.42s]  So, like, you know that now, so you can blame that. But I did that yesterday.
[503.42s -> 511.48s]  All right, let's go. You ready? Right where we left off,
[511.48s -> 517.14s]  uh, we had this dude here. We had to go get a bomb for this guy.
[517.14s -> 520.10s]  And just in case somebody missed it yesterday, I'll show you. I'll just
[520.10s -> 523.06s]  welcome, I'll show you. No, I'm not gonna do that. I was gonna punch him in the
[523.06s -> 525.14s]  face. I'm gonna punch him in the face. Just
[525.14s -> 529.22s]  the new audience can tell. Like that, like, you can do that.
[529.22s -> 535.46s]  Okay. How do I turn, all right. So, those of you that are wondering about this game,
[535.54s -> 540.17s]  um, you can see in the dark. Although, seeing in the dark just looks like
[540.17s -> 544.15s]  you're looking through a really expensive vase.
[544.15s -> 549.66s]  So, like, I have a piece of quartz up to my eye. All right.
[549.66s -> 557.75s]  I have to go back, right? Let me see. He wants me to go
[557.75s -> 563.03s]  get bomb. Go to tower 19 and get a bomb. To get to tower 19, head back from the
[563.03s -> 565.51s]  mining core up to the mine entrance, then use
[565.51s -> 568.47s]  Jagger's code to activate the elevator. All right, we have to go back to that
[568.47s -> 578.38s]  original elevator. I almost pressed that. What do I have?
[578.38s -> 584.34s]  Oh yeah, I have weapons. Don't adjust your monitor. Do not adjust
[584.34s -> 586.90s]  your screen. You're probably messing with the tent and
[586.90s -> 589.83s]  shit. Don't do that. The game is very ugly.
[589.83s -> 596.06s]  I promise it's not your screen. It's mine. Wait. Yes.
[596.06s -> 603.06s]  Yes. No. Yes. I was fucking with the tent, dad.
[603.06s -> 615.96s]  I just told you not to do that. It's not your screen. It's mine.
[615.96s -> 622.46s]  Uh, the game's kind of loud. I'm gonna turn the game down.
[622.46s -> 636.12s]  Fix my screen? Oh, no. That's you. You're making a joke. Okay.
[636.12s -> 638.68s]  Uh, all right. I gotta go back up. We're gonna go in the elevator. We're gonna
[638.68s -> 643.10s]  get a bomb from tower. I remember tower 19. It's where the it's in the
[643.10s -> 649.29s]  oops. Why does it look like sewer sludge is covering the screen?
[649.29s -> 653.74s]  Because this game is very, very, very ugly.
[653.74s -> 660.31s]  Now, I didn't say this is a bad game. This game is actually pretty fun, but it's
[660.31s -> 671.88s]  incredibly ugly. It's not ugly at all, to be honest. Well,
[671.88s -> 676.52s]  you'll see. This is only like a third of the game is
[676.52s -> 690.44s]  walking around with lights on. Most of the game looks like this. Oh,
[690.44s -> 699.66s]  we got two clubs here. Boom. Boomer. Wrong way. I think he's high.
[699.66s -> 703.80s]  Stop. Why did I even say that? And by the way, for those of you that's
[703.80s -> 709.08s]  saying, why is he like use this little like fucking black and decker nail gun?
[709.08s -> 712.87s]  No, I can't pick up, uh, I can't pick up weapons.
[712.87s -> 717.03s]  I'm unauthorized. I, everyone was very, very upset about that last time.
[717.03s -> 725.22s]  All right. I need to get out to the main area, which is
[725.22s -> 737.88s]  I go in the right way. Is this the right way? Yeah, this is right, right?
[737.88s -> 748.76s]  Mr. Rat. Get the rat. You missed the rat. Was there a rat on the ground?
[748.76s -> 763.72s]  Where's the rat? Rat list? Where is it? Are you? Dude, was it on the ground?
[763.72s -> 769.29s]  Oh, okay. There it is. List of rats. All right. I got it. I thought you're talking
[769.29s -> 771.77s]  about like, like there was a rat on the ground.
[771.77s -> 778.25s]  It's like you missed the rats. You missed the rats. Like, I thought like, oh, there's
[778.25s -> 785.10s]  like a rat on the ground. All right. Let's go. I just have to make
[785.10s -> 790.60s]  my way back to the elevator, which who knows how where that is.
[790.60s -> 797.32s]  It's been more than 24 hours. It's, it's gone from my mind.
[797.32s -> 803.50s]  Just jump. Oh, yeah. There's no fall damage. You're right. Can I use this?
[803.50s -> 807.56s]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Do I want to go in here though?
[807.56s -> 816.20s]  Where is it going to take me? Well, this is going to take me back up or down.
[816.20s -> 828.47s]  It's going to take you back up. That's, is that what that's what I want, right?
[828.47s -> 841.70s]  Try it out. Yeah. Don't press the red button.
[841.70s -> 850.76s]  Of course they would make a game where you have to backtrack again and then the
[850.76s -> 853.64s]  whole. Oh, no, no, no. This is it. This is it. This is it.
[853.64s -> 861.78s]  No, it's not. This is not it. This is not it.
[861.78s -> 868.28s]  Uh, I just went down. Somebody said I was going to go
[868.28s -> 873.29s]  up and then I went down. All right. Hey, welcome to the stream. Let's go.
[873.29s -> 898.81s]  Here we go again. Let's go up. This is brain.
[898.81s -> 902.86s]  Okay. So what what's the actual way to go?
[902.86s -> 906.44s]  Oh, God damn it. Are you telling me that I just could have walked through this?
[906.44s -> 915.90s]  So I went this way. No, I didn't. Wait.
[915.90s -> 921.18s]  Upper mines. Yeah, this is where I want. This is where I want to be. I hate
[921.18s -> 924.62s]  backtracking. I'm so glad it was deleted from every video game.
[924.62s -> 934.70s]  All right. So right or left though. What's like the actual how do I get like
[934.70s -> 956.47s]  back to where I want to go? He's on DMT. No, this way.
[956.47s -> 965.22s]  Imagine trying to stream on DMT. That would be impossible. If somebody
[965.22s -> 973.10s]  could do that in no fucking way. Not a chance in hell.
[973.18s -> 980.33s]  Where the hell do I even want to go though? Like I'm trying to just get back
[980.33s -> 999.14s]  to the beginning. This is a safe point. Okay. I gotta sneak
[999.14s -> 1009.75s]  through here. He's done it. Did I though? Like I have no idea
[1009.75s -> 1022.01s]  where the fuck I am. Climb those boxes. This is just bringing
[1022.01s -> 1036.97s]  me back this way. Through here? Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is to
[1036.97s -> 1047.29s]  security checkpoint. Right. This is this. I'm going the right way.
[1047.29s -> 1060.23s]  Game is now very, very quiet. I got you. Why is this so new? This is new. I haven't
[1060.23s -> 1068.73s]  seen this. Oh my god. This is the this is the beginning.
[1068.73s -> 1078.04s]  This is the beginning. Okay. I found it. Just check your map. Well, the problem
[1078.04s -> 1080.60s]  with the map is it literally just looks. I don't even
[1080.60s -> 1083.24s]  know where I am. I don't know which one of these rooms I'm in.
[1083.24s -> 1092.41s]  I made it. This is the beginning. I just don't die.
[1096.50s -> 1099.70s]  There's no fucking way I'm going to be able to get through this.
[1099.70s -> 1102.82s]  Not a chance. I'm not going to be able to. Can I electrocute him? Could I like
[1102.82s -> 1106.98s]  lure him out here and push him into the electricity? You shouldn't have eaten a
[1107.06s -> 1107.62s]  BLT.
[1113.16s -> 1121.75s]  Where's the light? Turn it off. You've had too much mayonnaise on that BLT, dude.
[1124.90s -> 1150.87s]  All right. Now you're in my world. Does he have to be?
[1151.67s -> 1154.15s]  Well, I'm never going to be able to get by this guy.
[1158.92s -> 1171.94s]  He's just standing in the doorway. I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.
[1176.55s -> 1179.59s]  I might as well just run. I think I'm going to have to just run.
[1187.03s -> 1192.07s]  Use the bat? This doesn't work. I already did this.
[1192.63s -> 1204.57s]  All right. Ready? One, two, three, go. I can't see anything.
[1223.45s -> 1229.94s]  Now that's what we call a. Okay. This is what I need to do, right?
[1232.41s -> 1238.14s]  What? I just got a new code. Oh, fuck this. I'm out. I'm done.
[1246.71s -> 1249.85s]  We actually just take this back. All right. Here we go.
[1253.08s -> 1256.28s]  Get the rifle. You can't pick up rifles. You can't pick up rifles. You can't.
[1256.92s -> 1259.72s]  Oh, yeah. I tried to tape this. It doesn't matter.
[1260.81s -> 1267.53s]  I ripped the tape off in rage. It didn't work. All right. Perfect.
[1268.25s -> 1274.49s]  Now it's going to go back to tower 19. Why is all this activated?
[1277.24s -> 1287.26s]  Can this open? This is all messed up. The vent to get in.
[1291.02s -> 1300.14s]  I just broke my chair. I'm sorry to hear that. What's the point of this vent?
[1307.29s -> 1317.88s]  Wait, why can I even open this? Oh, it's the cigarettes.
[1317.88s -> 1327.83s]  All right. Well, hold on a jump up here and climb. Get those ciggy butts.
[1327.83s -> 1342.28s]  What the hell am I doing? I feel like I'm cheating right now.
[1343.32s -> 1345.32s]  All right. Where am I? Cargo transport.
[1345.32s -> 1349.80s]  I need to go back to like tower 17 and like the feed ward. Where the fuck am I?
[1349.80s -> 1355.46s]  Security checkpoint. I climb and I hang.
[1363.35s -> 1366.07s]  I guess this is not going to. Why am I doing this?
[1367.03s -> 1378.78s]  What am I doing this for? I can't sneak attack him.
[1385.86s -> 1388.89s]  Can I break? Should I break? That door is not going to open.
[1389.61s -> 1392.54s]  That door doesn't open. I think I have to break the glass and go in.
[1408.63s -> 1410.87s]  Stealth kill. I don't think you can.
[1416.09s -> 1419.21s]  I'm right up his ass. If he moves, he's going to know I'm here.
[1419.21s -> 1427.70s]  Is this motherfucker even active?
[1431.18s -> 1434.30s]  Holy shit. I thought he was inactive. I thought he didn't do anything.
[1434.30s -> 1437.10s]  I thought he was inactive. I was bumping into him and stuff.
[1437.10s -> 1444.52s]  I thought he was not activated. I thought he was not moving around and shit.
[1444.52s -> 1449.83s]  OK, so what the fuck? So that's not the way to go.
[1450.63s -> 1455.93s]  So I need to go back down here.
[1458.95s -> 1468.20s]  I have to go and like climb into the vents and shit, don't I?
[1468.20s -> 1477.94s]  This is the wrong way. Am I getting a cut scene?
[1478.58s -> 1490.28s]  Wait, hold on. Hold on.
[1490.92s -> 1508.81s]  Do I just need to give me the lights? Turn the lights on.
[1509.37s -> 1528.66s]  And then we go backwards, right? Yeah.
[1528.66s -> 1541.24s]  No, we don't go backwards here. Stop using the club.
[1542.94s -> 1547.34s]  Well, that's not my main concern. My main concern is what's the one stupid way
[1547.34s -> 1552.30s]  to go back and go back, backtracking, backtracking, backtrack.
[1552.94s -> 1573.80s]  I have to go beyond the bridge? Stop the car.
[1573.80s -> 1575.88s]  I'm just going to watch a fucking YouTube video on how to get back here.
[1575.88s -> 1604.33s]  Hold on. That's cheating. That's fine.
[1604.33s -> 1606.89s]  He's doing the... He needs a video guide.
[1606.89s -> 1611.14s]  Why would you have it like climb through? I don't... I don't...
[1611.14s -> 1613.22s]  I'm not even going to... Look, I'm not even going to...
[1613.22s -> 1615.30s]  What do you want me to say? I'm not even going to say what you think I'm going to say.
[1615.94s -> 1621.00s]  All right, I've made it to another fucking gray room.
[1621.64s -> 1639.66s]  All right, now it's up... Do I go up here and then all the way around?
[1639.66s -> 1656.68s]  This is the mines again. You need to go back to the elevator.
[1657.32s -> 1660.09s]  What? The elevator just took me to a place I couldn't go.
[1661.21s -> 1665.38s]  Is this shit it? Did I make it?
[1674.07s -> 1677.83s]  Dude, you took the whole bottle. This is it, right?
[1677.83s -> 1679.91s]  No, because this just brings me... Wait, what?
[1680.63s -> 1684.78s]  This is the fan, which then brings you back to the original area, which then...
[1685.42s -> 1700.26s]  This is a mess. Don't turn the service panel back on, dude.
[1701.06s -> 1713.98s]  Okay, so this is the beginning. I should be able just to go in that elevator and take me down.
[1722.07s -> 1725.19s]  I remember this shit. Do you remember this? This is the very beginning.
[1728.17s -> 1730.33s]  This is how I got down here in the first place.
[1731.85s -> 1735.37s]  Remember? I was like, oh, I can't do this yet. Why is this elevator not the way out?
[1735.37s -> 1747.62s]  This is how we came in. Take this elevator.
[1747.62s -> 1750.10s]  Didn't I try that already? They took me to a weird fucked up place.
[1751.43s -> 1764.63s]  No, go up the ladder in this elevator. Wait, this is a different...
[1765.83s -> 1768.15s]  Wait, this is the same thing. You're fucking with me.
[1768.15s -> 1776.57s]  We're in the same spot. Use the elevator?
[1776.57s -> 1781.21s]  Didn't I do that already? It took me up to that weird spot where the guy was blocking the door.
[1781.21s -> 1783.45s]  Use the elevator first and then go up the vent.
[1787.19s -> 1790.87s]  Why? Why can't I just leave? Why can't I just leave?
[1802.63s -> 1805.75s]  He's never going to find the cheese. Why can't I just leave?
[1807.61s -> 1810.41s]  Oh, okay. So take elevator up. Don't go out elevator door.
[1810.41s -> 1812.41s]  Go up elevator fucking ladder into the dark vents.
[1812.41s -> 1814.81s]  Go through vents up. There's two different vents, by the way.
[1814.81s -> 1819.16s]  There's two elevators with two different vents. They both look the same.
[1824.22s -> 1829.50s]  What the fuck is this? What is this like being John Malkovich hole that I have to find?
[1830.06s -> 1833.03s]  Which, by the way, that's a pretty good movie if you haven't seen it.
[1833.59s -> 1843.27s]  All right. We found it. We did it.
[1843.27s -> 1846.71s]  All right. Good. Now I can finally just turn off the...
[1847.35s -> 1855.38s]  Wait, no, I didn't. Did I find it?
[1858.62s -> 1863.05s]  Oh, healing station. Oh, that's it. I don't want to do the vent thing again.
[1863.05s -> 1869.27s]  Oh, my God. I don't want to do the vent thing again.
[1871.30s -> 1873.22s]  Hey, by the way, guys, we hadn't even hit yet.
[1873.78s -> 1875.62s]  I just wanted to make that's going to be very clear.
[1876.26s -> 1885.74s]  Are we up or are we down? Where are we?
[1892.55s -> 1894.07s]  It's going to... Oh, it's going to get worse from here.
[1894.07s -> 1896.63s]  No, it's not because we're not going to have to do any more like vent climbing.
[1899.54s -> 1902.02s]  You'll know when you'll know because I'm just going to go...
[1903.48s -> 1912.20s]  Hey, I have to go that way. I have to go over here.
[1912.20s -> 1915.77s]  Right now, you hear me? This is... I'm completely with it.
[1916.71s -> 1921.59s]  Oh, maybe not completely, but as with it as I am without being on any type of substances.
[1924.57s -> 1927.37s]  He ate the whole... He took the whole... He ate the whole brownie.
[1929.82s -> 1934.68s]  It's going to be... That was what we call a little...
[1935.56s -> 1941.56s]  Oh, I thought I could... Never mind. All right. Give me the health.
[1941.56s -> 1943.00s]  He ate the whole plate.
[1953.69s -> 1957.29s]  How do you eat a whole plate of brownies in a regular circumstance?
[1957.29s -> 1958.09s]  That's what I want to know.
[1958.81s -> 1962.25s]  Oh, wow. He ate the whole plate.
[1962.25s -> 1964.41s]  Why would you eat a whole plate of brownies normally?
[1965.05s -> 1968.65s]  If this happens again, I'm going to eat the batteries that are in it.
[1968.65s -> 1971.98s]  Hope that doesn't happen again.
[1971.98s -> 1982.94s]  I feel like if I ate more than two brownies, it would be like cement in my stomach.
[1983.50s -> 1990.46s]  Did I fuck something up?
[1992.38s -> 1993.74s]  Why could I not do this? What's going on?
[1994.63s -> 1996.23s]  Oh, thank God. It's another vent.
[1996.23s -> 1997.51s]  Wait, there's two vents now.
[1998.23s -> 2000.36s]  There are three vents.
[2001.08s -> 2002.46s]  What's the right vent?
[2002.46s -> 2003.66s]  Oh, I can't even go in that one.
[2011.78s -> 2012.74s]  Am I doing this right?
[2013.22s -> 2023.91s]  I really hope I never have to do this again because this sucks.
[2023.91s -> 2025.51s]  I don't want to be in vents.
[2026.15s -> 2040.89s]  I don't want to just do vents while I be in a dark room
[2040.89s -> 2047.90s]  and then immediately go to a light room the whole day.
[2055.42s -> 2057.26s]  Like, I don't think I've even been here.
[2057.26s -> 2064.09s]  Oh, cigarettes. What is this?
[2064.09s -> 2064.73s]  Can I climb that?
[2087.94s -> 2090.02s]  My character's just like on DMT.
[2090.82s -> 2093.70s]  Oh, shit. The lights are so bright.
[2093.70s -> 2094.58s]  Turn the lights up.
[2096.73s -> 2097.45s]  Where am I?
[2104.25s -> 2105.53s]  No, don't make any jokes. I don't want to lose.
[2115.24s -> 2117.08s]  I'm sorry, dude. I'm on fucking DMT.
[2118.22s -> 2119.34s]  I don't even know who you are.
[2119.98s -> 2130.49s]  Is this thing alive?
[2130.49s -> 2143.90s]  That thing's going to come out and attack me, isn't it?
[2143.90s -> 2144.78s]  Am I going crazy?
[2144.78s -> 2146.78s]  Was I just supposed to go back to tower 19?
[2147.90s -> 2149.42s]  What is all this shit?
[2149.42s -> 2152.90s]  Was I not supposed to kill him?
[2154.60s -> 2156.04s]  Wait, do I need a screwdriver?
[2160.76s -> 2163.24s]  Was it an NPC? Did I ruin everything?
[2163.24s -> 2169.40s]  What's over here?
[2169.40s -> 2170.28s]  Oh, I can go down there.
[2170.28s -> 2178.58s]  This is where I was before.
[2178.58s -> 2179.38s]  Did I miss something?
[2180.02s -> 2183.96s]  I didn't soft lock the game, right?
[2183.96s -> 2193.98s]  No. No, I didn't.
[2193.98s -> 2199.37s]  Hold on. Wait, did I DMT lock the game?
[2199.37s -> 2204.86s]  I hope that's not the running thing
[2204.86s -> 2206.86s]  we continue to reference this stream.
[2206.86s -> 2209.82s]  I'm sure it will be, but I don't want it to be that.
[2209.82s -> 2210.30s]  What's this?
[2220.12s -> 2221.48s]  No, there's nothing down here.
[2222.04s -> 2223.80s]  I have to do something with that robot in there.
[2224.44s -> 2243.70s]  No doors or anything.
[2246.41s -> 2253.13s]  Guys, I think I may have soft locked myself.
[2262.58s -> 2265.14s]  No, there's a ladder.
[2271.00s -> 2271.80s]  Is it alive?
[2271.80s -> 2274.12s]  What? Hold on, what?
[2274.12s -> 2275.16s]  I get to be in the suit?
[2275.88s -> 2283.10s]  Oh, shit!
[2283.66s -> 2289.70s]  I don't know where I am.
[2293.59s -> 2294.55s]  How many balls do I have?
[2296.60s -> 2298.28s]  Wait, why can I walk through walls?
[2308.55s -> 2309.83s]  I had the thing on.
[2309.83s -> 2310.55s]  I had the thing on.
[2312.55s -> 2313.91s]  But this doesn't help me.
[2313.91s -> 2315.19s]  This just makes me more dangerous.
[2315.19s -> 2316.23s]  I still don't know where to go.
[2324.49s -> 2327.13s]  Oh, I'm opening the doors with my little T-Rex hand.
[2331.00s -> 2332.28s]  I'm going to the briefing room.
[2340.44s -> 2341.64s]  All right, nice work.
[2347.14s -> 2355.78s]  Oh, okay.
[2355.78s -> 2356.58s]  Okay, I don't.
[2357.54s -> 2362.15s]  Is he dead?
[2362.15s -> 2363.35s]  Wait, can I get in his suit?
[2363.99s -> 2365.91s]  I want to get in his suit.
[2366.71s -> 2372.71s]  Wait, why are there two?
[2373.35s -> 2374.62s]  There were two?
[2375.18s -> 2376.22s]  How are there two of them?
[2378.52s -> 2379.48s]  Oh no, look at him.
[2379.48s -> 2381.32s]  He's sad.
[2381.32s -> 2382.20s]  Look at what he did.
[2383.00s -> 2390.39s]  He made me kill.
[2391.35s -> 2398.60s]  Two of my reverent monstrosities.
[2398.60s -> 2400.60s]  I never want to be in this place again.
[2402.71s -> 2408.82s]  Jerry, take me from here once and for all.
[2408.82s -> 2409.70s]  Okay, man.
[2409.70s -> 2410.82s]  Let's get out of here.
[2410.82s -> 2419.32s]  And Jerry, if you would please give me some of that DMT.
[2421.06s -> 2422.34s]  Oh, you want some DMT, dude?
[2422.34s -> 2423.06s]  All right, you got it.
[2424.54s -> 2425.58s]  I'll take some right now.
[2426.76s -> 2427.56s]  Right now?
[2427.56s -> 2428.52s]  Right now?
[2428.52s -> 2428.76s]  Yes.
[2431.85s -> 2432.49s]  Hold on, man.
[2432.49s -> 2440.28s]  I'm not sure you're ready for this.
[2440.28s -> 2441.08s]  I am ready.
[2441.08s -> 2443.48s]  I'm starting to consider this whole witty thing a major-
[2443.48s -> 2443.96s]  All right, man.
[2443.96s -> 2444.52s]  Here you go.
[2444.52s -> 2445.80s]  I'm going to give it to you right now.
[2445.80s -> 2447.40s]  Just lift your tongue up.
[2454.42s -> 2455.06s]  Holy shit.
[2456.74s -> 2457.38s]  Holy shit.
[2458.18s -> 2460.31s]  I can see the machine alien.
[2461.11s -> 2466.36s]  Perons have been here for 10,000 years.
[2466.92s -> 2467.72s]  Not 10 billion.
[2468.52s -> 2485.08s]  I think the clerk at my local Walmart is actually Jesus reborn.
[2486.20s -> 2488.12s]  And here are 200 reasons why.
[2491.42s -> 2491.98s]  Hey, whoa, man.
[2491.98s -> 2492.38s]  Whoa, man.
[2492.38s -> 2494.22s]  You got to settle down on a DMT.
[2497.45s -> 2501.32s]  Oh, that was wonderful.
[2502.04s -> 2504.25s]  Thank you for that experience.
[2505.53s -> 2506.25s]  Yeah, man.
[2506.25s -> 2508.01s]  I really wanted to DMT you.
[2508.01s -> 2509.69s]  Just hit me up any time of the week.
[2517.02s -> 2517.74s]  Get out of here.
[2528.95s -> 2529.51s]  Get out.
[2530.31s -> 2532.71s]  I need to get out of the robot to see.
[2533.59s -> 2537.98s]  Anybody know where I'm going?
[2542.30s -> 2543.26s]  Read the screen.
[2548.86s -> 2551.26s]  It's just Matrix glitter.
[2551.26s -> 2552.30s]  I can't read that.
[2556.12s -> 2560.01s]  Did I just go back the other way?
[2560.01s -> 2577.29s]  Oh, no.
[2577.29s -> 2577.85s]  Shit.
[2577.85s -> 2579.69s]  Somebody just said this guy is dumb.
[2580.09s -> 2580.97s]  No, dude, I'm not.
[2581.53s -> 2582.01s]  I'll get it.
[2582.57s -> 2583.53s]  Don't leave.
[2583.53s -> 2584.33s]  Just hold on.
[2584.33s -> 2603.78s]  All right.
[2603.78s -> 2605.46s]  I got rid of the noise.
[2605.46s -> 2611.03s]  Wait, that was a big problem for me,
[2611.03s -> 2612.71s]  but that wasn't the actual problem.
[2612.71s -> 2624.98s]  I can't go through any of these.
[2624.98s -> 2631.37s]  Maybe I'm really just not supposed to go this way
[2631.37s -> 2635.00s]  unless there's an event.
[2635.00s -> 2637.11s]  Wait, I have to...
[2637.11s -> 2639.43s]  No, I have to leave DMT robot.
[2639.43s -> 2639.91s]  No, I don't.
[2639.91s -> 2640.79s]  He can get up here.
[2640.79s -> 2658.15s]  Oh, no.
[2658.15s -> 2661.62s]  That's too bad.
[2667.16s -> 2668.36s]  Oh, that's it.
[2668.36s -> 2676.38s]  Well, see you later, DMT robot.
[2676.38s -> 2681.67s]  It's been a lot of fun.
[2681.67s -> 2682.55s]  Thank you, Jerry.
[2683.35s -> 2685.70s]  You have given me more experiences
[2685.70s -> 2687.70s]  than I could possibly ask for in a human.
[2688.42s -> 2693.06s]  Have a wonderful rest of your game.
[2695.08s -> 2700.26s]  Powering Joe.
[2700.26s -> 2700.76s]  Bye.
[2701.30s -> 2702.02s]  Bye.
[2702.02s -> 2702.90s]  It's nice to meet you.
[2702.90s -> 2703.54s]  Bye.
[2703.54s -> 2711.42s]  Turn off the filter.
[2715.19s -> 2715.67s]  Where'd he go?
[2720.07s -> 2740.94s]  The real DMT was the friends we made along the way.
[2740.94s -> 2744.63s]  This elevator sucks.
[2744.63s -> 2745.51s]  Why is it not moving?
[2745.51s -> 2754.12s]  It's because it's not an elevator.
[2754.12s -> 2755.77s]  Shit.
[2755.77s -> 2756.49s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[2759.03s -> 2765.34s]  All right.
[2765.34s -> 2766.70s]  DMT robot, power on.
[2769.66s -> 2772.14s]  We're going to have a bunch more fun, man.
[2772.14s -> 2773.26s]  We're going to take DMT
[2773.26s -> 2774.54s]  and we're going to do all this fun shit.
[2775.42s -> 2776.38s]  I cannot wait.
[2776.38s -> 2777.50s]  Please climb inside of me.
[2778.30s -> 2779.10s]  No.
[2779.10s -> 2792.94s]  Oh, no.
[2793.82s -> 2797.77s]  That's the origin story for DMT robot becoming a villain.
[2797.77s -> 2798.97s]  Why am I climbing this?
[2799.77s -> 2802.58s]  Why would he do that?
[2802.58s -> 2803.30s]  I didn't do that.
[2810.70s -> 2811.90s]  I didn't climb that.
[2811.90s -> 2813.34s]  I wanted just to walk down here.
[2823.29s -> 2823.61s]  Okay.
[2824.84s -> 2825.40s]  I'm...
[2825.40s -> 2827.72s]  It's hard to aim at the guy.
[2829.48s -> 2831.80s]  It's very, very difficult.
[2831.80s -> 2833.24s]  It's a difficult experience.
[2833.24s -> 2834.44s]  That's a difficult game.
[2834.44s -> 2835.00s]  It's hard.
[2835.00s -> 2836.28s]  It's a difficult game.
[2843.86s -> 2850.06s]  Why is he shooting at me?
[2850.70s -> 2851.10s]  No.
[2851.10s -> 2851.98s]  DMT robot.
[2851.98s -> 2852.54s]  What are you doing?
[2853.78s -> 2856.38s]  Oh, that was another robot.
[2864.87s -> 2865.91s]  What the fuck happened here?
[2874.39s -> 2875.19s]  Okay.
[2875.19s -> 2875.59s]  All right.
[2876.47s -> 2877.59s]  How do I get you to move?
[2878.71s -> 2879.43s]  Oh, no.
[2880.39s -> 2886.09s]  Oh, no.
[2886.09s -> 2888.65s]  It's CVT robot.
[2888.65s -> 2891.85s]  No, that can't be who that canonically is in this universe.
[2891.85s -> 2892.33s]  I'm sorry.
[2895.83s -> 2896.47s]  Just get in.
[2897.03s -> 2899.26s]  Let's go.
[2908.02s -> 2911.30s]  I only died before I could do the joke part of what I was going to do.
[2913.86s -> 2917.38s]  It is too bad that one of my friends had to perish.
[2919.77s -> 2920.57s]  What happened?
[2920.57s -> 2921.69s]  What happened to the audio?
[2921.69s -> 2929.80s]  Did I fuck it up?
[2936.06s -> 2936.46s]  All right.
[2936.46s -> 2938.54s]  Well, that's where that arc ends.
[2938.54s -> 2939.90s]  I was going to do a thing where
[2939.90s -> 2943.42s]  this was going to be his dad mad that he was taking DMT.
[2943.42s -> 2945.50s]  He was going to be like, I'm adventuring, dad.
[2945.50s -> 2946.06s]  Leave me alone.
[2946.06s -> 2947.10s]  And they're going to be the big fight.
[2947.10s -> 2949.58s]  And it's like his dad dies because they're fighting.
[2949.58s -> 2950.94s]  You know, that's going to do that whole thing.
[2951.82s -> 2954.02s]  Let's just pretend I did that.
[2954.02s -> 2954.26s]  All right.
[2954.26s -> 2954.74s]  That was fun.
[2955.46s -> 2973.99s]  I did not expect that I was actually going to get into one of these though.
[2973.99s -> 2977.26s]  The whole game, they tease you about how scary they are.
[2978.46s -> 2991.93s]  It's going to be really sad when he actually dies.
[2991.93s -> 2995.66s]  I'm out of his aggro range.
[2995.66s -> 2995.98s]  It's fine.
[2996.78s -> 3004.54s]  Grenade.
[3009.69s -> 3010.17s]  Oh, no.
[3010.17s -> 3010.97s]  He's going to die.
[3014.50s -> 3015.70s]  Is there a healing thing I can do?
[3019.38s -> 3020.50s]  These people are friendly.
[3022.84s -> 3024.44s]  These people are not friendly.
[3024.44s -> 3024.68s]  Okay.
[3026.39s -> 3026.71s]  Okay.
[3026.71s -> 3027.27s]  That's it.
[3027.27s -> 3028.79s]  Someone's sitting in the flamingos.
[3035.14s -> 3036.02s]  I took a lot of hits.
[3037.94s -> 3038.66s]  Flamingos?
[3038.66s -> 3038.82s]  Yeah.
[3038.82s -> 3039.54s]  What does that mean?
[3040.18s -> 3049.27s]  I'm almost dead.
[3055.80s -> 3059.96s]  I feel like this is what the dinosaur fossils of an AT-ST would look like.
[3059.96s -> 3060.60s]  He's dead.
[3060.60s -> 3062.10s]  Does it mean I'm dead?
[3062.10s -> 3082.18s]  I got to be careful here.
[3082.18s -> 3083.70s]  Out of like health.
[3083.70s -> 3089.46s]  Prepare the robot.
[3089.46s -> 3089.78s]  I don't know.
[3090.58s -> 3091.38s]  I don't know how to do that.
[3101.48s -> 3102.44s]  No, you can't.
[3103.48s -> 3104.76s]  I have the screwdriver on.
[3104.76s -> 3105.24s]  It doesn't work.
[3106.04s -> 3111.59s]  I just have to not take any hits.
[3112.23s -> 3118.39s]  It's kind of hard to do that, though.
[3118.95s -> 3124.74s]  It's regenerating health.
[3125.30s -> 3126.95s]  Is it?
[3128.06s -> 3128.46s]  Okay.
[3128.46s -> 3130.14s]  They expect me to walk through immediately.
[3130.14s -> 3130.54s]  I didn't.
[3130.54s -> 3131.26s]  They blew everything up.
[3139.66s -> 3140.38s]  Stand still.
[3141.02s -> 3143.59s]  All right.
[3143.59s -> 3145.27s]  I'm going to stand still after this and see if I heal.
[3154.55s -> 3154.71s]  Okay.
[3154.71s -> 3155.03s]  Here we go.
[3155.03s -> 3155.27s]  Ready?
[3155.27s -> 3157.91s]  Let's, for God's sake, hope they can do their job.
[3158.47s -> 3161.24s]  Shut it off.
[3161.88s -> 3162.12s]  Yep.
[3166.39s -> 3167.43s]  I don't think that it works.
[3169.29s -> 3170.57s]  I think we have to ditch.
[3170.57s -> 3172.81s]  Somebody said R2DMT2.
[3173.53s -> 3174.25s]  I think that's two.
[3174.25s -> 3175.13s]  I don't know about that.
[3175.13s -> 3176.73s]  I'm not sure I'm going to sign off on that one.
[3177.53s -> 3179.08s]  No, there's no deal.
[3185.67s -> 3187.67s]  I just have to not die to the flamingos.
[3187.67s -> 3190.89s]  That was my joke.
[3191.61s -> 3196.58s]  Yeah, so I said somebody said that.
[3198.44s -> 3198.84s]  Okay.
[3198.84s -> 3199.72s]  This is important.
[3209.53s -> 3209.77s]  Shit.
[3213.66s -> 3214.86s]  God, he's dying.
[3215.74s -> 3216.30s]  I'm sorry.
[3216.30s -> 3216.86s]  I got to get out.
[3217.42s -> 3217.82s]  Get out.
[3217.82s -> 3218.14s]  Get out.
[3218.14s -> 3218.54s]  Get out.
[3226.09s -> 3234.41s]  Duck.
[3234.41s -> 3234.65s]  No.
[3235.05s -> 3235.29s]  Wait.
[3235.29s -> 3235.93s]  I'm just looking at...
[3235.93s -> 3236.57s]  They're killing him.
[3238.92s -> 3250.20s]  I'm stuck in here.
[3250.76s -> 3253.43s]  I'm actually stuck in here.
[3253.43s -> 3253.91s]  I can't move.
[3254.79s -> 3255.51s]  How did I get in here?
[3262.44s -> 3263.08s]  Wait.
[3263.08s -> 3266.25s]  I can smoke.
[3266.25s -> 3269.53s]  Can I keep going up?
[3270.25s -> 3276.98s]  How the hell am I going to do this without the robot?
[3277.70s -> 3279.30s]  Wait.
[3279.30s -> 3280.02s]  What about up there?
[3280.66s -> 3284.70s]  Ow.
[3285.42s -> 3288.63s]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[3288.63s -> 3289.13s]  Ah.
[3289.91s -> 3291.80s]  I would have...
[3291.80s -> 3293.08s]  I could have shot the lights.
[3293.08s -> 3293.88s]  Fuck, you're right.
[3293.88s -> 3295.16s]  Oh, I'm so stupid.
[3295.72s -> 3304.18s]  I'm not fucking around anymore.
[3304.18s -> 3304.58s]  Let's go.
[3313.50s -> 3314.14s]  Yeah, that's right.
[3314.14s -> 3314.62s]  I took the...
[3314.62s -> 3315.90s]  I got the last punch.
[3315.90s -> 3321.64s]  Did not mean to exit.
[3332.30s -> 3334.46s]  Send in the flamingos.
[3334.86s -> 3348.04s]  Did, did, did, did, did, did, did.
[3348.04s -> 3351.67s]  This dude says, ow, and he gets hit in the video game.
[3351.67s -> 3352.15s]  LOL.
[3352.15s -> 3352.31s]  Yeah.
[3352.31s -> 3352.79s]  Okay.

[3356.71s -> 3358.23s]  I ordered the fucking vest thing
[3358.23s -> 3360.23s]  that vibrates when you take damage in a game.

[3369.05s -> 3370.09s]  Okay, fine, dude.

[5228.50s -> 5235.62s]  vin diesel's voice is so low that he sounds like you know when any demon character is on screen
[5236.34s -> 5242.84s]  they always speak like whenever they i want to hear a demon talk in a normal speaking voice
[5242.84s -> 5252.12s]  it's vin diesel that's how they would actually sound every single demon on earth just is always
[5252.12s -> 5260.28s]  yelling loudly why do they make them do that in games the only way that you can tell that i'm
[5260.28s -> 5272.66s]  powerful is if i fucking scream every piece of my dialogue human just have vin diesel say what i
[5272.66s -> 5281.42s]  just said in a normal speaking voice you know what i find uh most uncomfortable about you ready
[5281.42s -> 5291.86s]  comfortable you are here in butcher bay i mean caged inside this so this is scripted i played
[5291.86s -> 5298.17s]  the hand that was dumb and then i cheat Thanos doesn't yell but he's not a big demon with a big
[5298.17s -> 5312.81s]  axe oh i killed him in one punch holy shit i killed him in one punch oh no oh real voice
[5316.66s -> 5324.78s]  that was brutal but what the hell is going on okay you telling me that from both angles here
[5328.39s -> 5340.38s]  from both angles there's a is there a vent it's gonna be the toilet jump off at the right time
[5344.95s -> 5360.26s]  oh like on to that guys i don't think i'm gonna be able to get that i gotta count i have to count
[5360.26s -> 5367.72s]  it's the only way i'm gonna be able to do this reliably okay it's here it is so it's down let's
[5367.72s -> 5395.86s]  go now right i got killed by the blade but you know what i find uh most uncomfortable about you
[5395.86s -> 5411.67s]  Riddick i played the hand not a bad philosophy this is for you so it's just all right stop stop
[5411.67s -> 5418.47s]  stop wait okay i have to wait till it goes up watch that light on the left one two what that
[5418.47s -> 5429.91s]  went very fast what wait i'm going am i going down am i going up well i'm not supposed to ride
[5429.91s -> 5433.83s]  like the brake glass elevator like in Willy Wonka i thought that's what this was
[5434.63s -> 5475.86s]  so hold on why didn't i not get the cut scene before oh i stood up didn't kill me
[5480.78s -> 5493.54s]  i just scraped the top of my head across the 200 feet of cement when that train falls in
[5494.26s -> 5522.78s]  it's down to my bottom jaw scraped down get up listen what did you say listen

[5927.82s -> 5943.40s]  i don't know any of the codes oh listen to that a ladder vents and ladders don't hey don't go in
[5943.40s -> 5948.34s]  the vents you'll go all the way back to the beginning climb a ladder up you'll progress
[5948.34s -> 5977.90s]  10 fucking minutes all right there's a button that's alarm
[5986.25s -> 5998.63s]  i can't give up you killed me what's fuck you okay i have one oh what are they called

[6048.12s -> 6066.38s]  maybe i shouldn't go in the grate yet i just oh i want to have quick reaction times i can have
[6067.34s -> 6071.35s]  activate no turn it off rail defense deactivated
[6079.21s -> 6115.18s]  turn it it's off okay that was a random worker that was way health thank you so what is this
[6118.34s -> 6151.37s]  rail track computer right that rails finished need to find another i do that wrong what it's
[6151.37s -> 6166.62s]  because the alarm wasn't on where do i go then wait what's this thing wait where's this taking
[6166.62s -> 6211.62s]  me okay who's coming behind me he didn't notice shit for all this guy knows i could have been

[6379.45s -> 6410.82s]  stop dying on purpose for more donations i'm taking a look the vent up there they're going
[6410.82s -> 6431.00s]  the vent you think yeah all right i gotta destroy this i know i'll run into it later all right let's
[6431.00s -> 6452.94s]  go in the vent so i think this guy's below average iq no i don't i don't incredibly fucking smart my
[6452.94s -> 6463.78s]  mother told me every day just how smart i was she was like you're so smart i'm just i'm gonna
[6463.78s -> 6470.12s]  give you smart boost i'm like oh cool smart boosting and she that she would do the my homework
[6470.12s -> 6478.92s]  with me i was sitting at the table and i would be stuck on a very difficult question you know like
[6480.66s -> 6486.42s]  six times 12 and shit that's i'd be like mom i need a smart boost she'd be like and she'd fly in
[6487.78s -> 6493.94s]  with a little cape on smart booster to the rescue and then when i graduated college
[6494.50s -> 6514.01s]  didn't think i really needed it anymore so just skipped a bunch of shit how many guys are down
[6514.01s -> 6519.56s]  there all right no no no i got jumped down and killed i just broke my ankle that was a shattered
[6519.56s -> 6559.99s]  leg i don't think he's gonna have a weapon what the fuck no please turn the backup generator
[6559.99s -> 6565.91s]  go find me a new car go find me a generator go find me this go find me that go take care of that
[6565.91s -> 6608.36s]  oh thank god there's a mom came in with a smart booster where's the other like i don't know i need
[6608.36s -> 6622.82s]  to be able to see through walls so i can see where the things are remember she gave you a placebo to
[6622.82s -> 6627.86s]  make you feel better about your learning difficulties what do you mean placebo she
[6627.86s -> 6645.19s]  wasn't walking in the door with like pills in her hand oh she didn't go oh here are smart boosters
[6645.19s -> 6665.46s]  and then like hand me like three pills wait wait what do you mean whippets what are you talking
[6665.46s -> 6671.86s]  about like wait you're saying that my mother did whippets and then like flew into the room with
[6671.86s -> 6695.99s]  like a cape on like do being like the smart booster i can't i honestly like i can't even
[6695.99s -> 6700.39s]  like address that that's too fucking outrageous for me to think about my mother doing that
[6703.86s -> 6708.34s]  oh somebody said dream thank god you said it i had a dream i had a dream last night that was very
[6708.34s -> 6718.84s]  strange it involves all of you i had a dream last night that i was sleeping in bed i was asleep all
[6718.84s -> 6724.34s]  the lights were off and i got out of bed or this is probably around one or two o'clock in the morning
[6724.34s -> 6731.29s]  like this i actually got out of bed to go to the bathroom but i was dreaming at the same time it
[6731.29s -> 6738.25s]  was really weird like i in my dream went up to go to the bathroom but i know that i woke up and i
[6738.25s -> 6746.06s]  went to the bathroom that's what i was doing so i went to go into the i went to pee into the toilet
[6746.06s -> 6752.90s]  and and i saw chat saying just like clockwork just like clockwork there he is right on time
[6752.90s -> 6759.54s]  right on time like you i sleep on stream and at 1 a.m like it's a thing that i get up and pee every
[6759.54s -> 6769.80s]  time i guess oh here it is like it's 1 a.m it's just like clockwork like omega lull that's the
[6769.80s -> 6789.67s]  whole dream and then i went back to sleep i was the generator i don't touch these and this was a
[6789.67s -> 6798.07s]  very very popular stream too it was there were tens of thousands of people here like i was the
[6798.07s -> 6804.15s]  sleeping on stream guy and everybody at 1 a.m it was like a thing that they were like emotes and
[6804.15s -> 6809.58s]  shit about it like just like right on time but i was just fucking sleeping and like going i was

[6815.56s -> 6844.65s]  all right powers back on now i just gotta go back up and turn that shit on third ladder here i have
[6844.65s -> 6864.17s]  to get grabbed by that thing yeah just like clockwork all right back up and then this way
[6864.17s -> 6877.27s]  how do you feel about brain fluids hostile takeover of smart boosters you know what there really are
[6877.27s -> 6888.10s]  so many random what i just do oh fuck i didn't want to do that um there are so many random
[6888.10s -> 6895.75s]  supplements that do that that say that stuff smart and they always for some reason they always have
[6895.75s -> 6902.09s]  two or three big letters at the end i've never been able to figure out why that happens smart
[6902.09s -> 6915.11s]  booster qa z smart booster xr what the fuck is that for it's they're called smart boosters why
[6915.11s -> 6925.14s]  they called smart boosters like xr smart booster x3 why can't why can't just be smart boosters
[6927.56s -> 6940.02s]  it is a link here hold on what is it you wouldn't understand what is this why are you showing me
[6940.02s -> 6958.46s]  this wait okay hold on is this this is a picture of what i believe is me eating um some type of

[7044.79s -> 7064.17s]  on that did i what happened did i walk in a circle no no now we go up just like clockwork
[7074.46s -> 7080.90s]  yeah where's that there was that little hallway that i could go and open backtrack and fucking
[7080.90s -> 7095.83s]  bury man i'm safe back to yeah i'm trying to find that real thing that needed power
[7095.83s -> 7105.72s]  i don't know i don't remember where it is from where is the germa shit stream um i've read that
[7105.72s -> 7110.68s]  in a bunch of different i thought you were saying when when when is like the good stream germa this
[7110.68s -> 7123.37s]  is shit i thought i don't know why that's what i've read okay um help me out here where was that area
[7124.23s -> 7133.75s]  in the vent or down here or down or over i don't really remember backtrack and i can't do it
[7133.75s -> 7147.59s]  you went past it not an event it's just in here down in the x door again here but i'm like what's
[7147.59s -> 7163.16s]  that power source bro down the ladder bro bro bro all right remember i said what is this thing
[7163.16s -> 7190.74s]  i gotta go on the lift right and yeah right no then wait no this is where i pressed the original
[7190.74s -> 7200.62s]  button is it there was a button that i pressed that i went oh and the thing crashed oh shit yeah
[7200.62s -> 7247.54s]  this is where that one is the edibles kicked in okay down the ladder bro this is not right
[7247.54s -> 7254.49s]  this is so wrong isn't it this is not even right everyone's so preoccupied with saying bro that
[7254.49s -> 7262.52s]  that okay saying bro is trumps saying like he's an idiot he's a stupid fucking idiot
[7262.52s -> 7286.79s]  he's never gonna find it the invention of like blips on mini maps oh man whoever invented that
[7286.79s -> 7301.66s]  i hope you patented it what am i doing down here this is wrong we're not gonna talk about
[7301.66s -> 7315.67s]  what i just said what are you talking about i said the same bro trumps saying like i'm lost

[7379.03s -> 7409.54s]  hell i'm going okay what does it say back up generator what what no no no no what what this
[7413.37s -> 7440.26s]  bro oh bro bro okay so now i do i have to go all the way back to the other spot
[7440.98s -> 7457.91s]  for the original activator so that's all the way back here all right i want people to correct me
[7457.91s -> 7474.23s]  if i'm going the wrong way bro please i don't i'm just gonna jump over these okay that other
[7474.23s -> 7481.53s]  spot let's see the rail track is fully functional you can now ride a cell further down to the mining
[7481.53s -> 7503.69s]  core all right okay oh where the backup generator is all right i'm telling you something if you
[7503.69s -> 7523.70s]  ride in all capitals and you just say do monkey noises they're funny oh but i didn't it isn't
[7524.50s -> 7529.46s]  isn't um isn't vin diesel like a wicked good dude by the way like i just like i was going
[7529.46s -> 7545.13s]  to talk about that yesterday no yes he is i heard it i thought he was like like a wicked nice guy
[7546.41s -> 7563.35s]  he's weird oh oh he's not i i i stopped saying wicked why can i not say that
[7564.07s -> 7575.66s]  wasn't he like a like a gamer wouldn't he like really like into like supporting game stuff
[7577.78s -> 7594.55s]  my brain of vin diesel is like 12 years ago i don't remember he eats boiled chicken whoa okay
[7594.55s -> 7609.34s]  never mind i my opinion on him just changed very drastically oh fuck vin diesel once played dnd
[7609.34s -> 7625.13s]  with trump that's naughty that's what you made that up like you made that up i can't think of
[7625.13s -> 7631.64s]  something that was more made up than what you just said wait and i don't like activate it
[7633.78s -> 7648.82s]  wait hold on what back to the backup generator back to the generator i was just there i thought
[7648.82s -> 7661.90s]  that i already turned it on like i would believe aliens landed on earth and like we're all going
[7661.90s -> 7668.46s]  to be like they're gonna just like enslave like all everybody like we're like aliens come and
[7668.46s -> 7675.59s]  we're now they like just take over i would believe that more than news than vin diesel
[7675.59s -> 7701.37s]  and donald trump played dnd together it's real this is not that this is toy fair performances
[7702.17s -> 7708.89s]  he sends the competition to a watery grave this is not donald trump playing dnd it's the hammerhead
[7712.68s -> 7722.92s]  uh i okay never mind what what what is this twitter you're doing what are you linking me
[7726.39s -> 7730.79s]  vin diesel hey nice stream real mature impressions you mogul now get electrocuted

[7736.55s -> 7743.30s]  prank you got that you have to space that out more like more than a couple of months i think
[7744.12s -> 7755.34s]  that you just did this two days ago i don't think that works right now okay back to the backup
[7755.34s -> 7778.04s]  generator which god where am i backup generator i can't this map is filled in this is gonna go up
[7778.04s -> 7783.53s]  there's an elevator right oh my god i don't know what the fuck is going on

[7849.30s -> 7855.56s]  we did it back up generator ladies and gentlemen let's go here we go
[7855.56s -> 7906.92s]  what where was the cut scene where vin diesel grabs the thing and we why is he playing the
[7906.92s -> 7911.80s]  shittiest game ever i wouldn't say that all right hold on that's this is not the shittiest game ever
[7919.14s -> 7934.17s]  no links no links no links what is it i'm not gonna i'm not gonna show that on stream i don't
[7934.17s -> 7939.90s]  know i'm not i'm not i clicked it it was funny i don't know like they could is like i don't know
[7939.90s -> 7943.10s]  if there's a guy that there's like a dick in there i don't know i can't i have no idea
[7943.74s -> 7960.47s]  where am i what's the goal now plant the bomb in the gas filled room the creatures in there
[7960.47s -> 7972.78s]  will cause a lot of mayhem the gas filled room wait like the room that's all the way over here
[7973.42s -> 7986.46s]  who's this you must be ready jager told me to wait for you jager's gonna try to reach the space
[7986.46s -> 7993.27s]  port redick should put that package from jupiter in the cave when hell breaks loose
[7993.27s -> 8002.58s]  we dig heads for the space port yeah that's what he said john hey look it's john basket uh look at
[8002.58s -> 8038.10s]  me i hate john basket so much why i don't have to chill man okay we have to go into the room with
[8038.10s -> 8059.05s]  the gas and plant the bomb and i think i'm going the right way here we go plant the bomb
[8062.20s -> 8083.43s]  this is so bright all right where am i going get in what's hell i don't know why i'm thinking
[8083.43s -> 8089.35s]  about this but that this just looks like um every movie with a budget of under 200 000
[8089.35s -> 8094.47s]  dollars when they need to be in a space like this like a ton of indy movies look like this they make

[12870.55s -> 12887.30s]  why is the cryo jail easier than the mines yeah i don't know why was the mines the most horrible
[12887.30s -> 12902.39s]  thing ever everything else was so much fun and then it was just it just ruined everything
[12902.39s -> 12929.10s]  where is he you can't shoot through that glass done holy shit dude your aim i'm fine it's tricky

[13051.62s -> 13057.94s]  i fought gigantic robots that took way less effort than shooting a regular guy with a pistol
[13065.66s -> 13071.18s]  you shouldn't stream on cbd this is bad is atrocious this is every single stream you may

[13144.34s -> 13147.70s]  probably people people that come into this stream and think that i'm using a mouse and i'm playing
[13147.70s -> 13163.24s]  like this it's gotta be at least some people probably think that right i mean if i knew this

[13633.34s -> 13647.80s]  what i i don't think it is actually i think that's a is it i can't tell is that just the
[13647.80s -> 13655.29s]  background i'm looking at it was only rockets for robots oh it is okay let's just hang on
[13655.29s -> 13674.07s]  nightbot banned me i'll make a low well you shouldn't be acting up then you should be

[13769.30s -> 13780.04s]  the area it's annoying i just it's it just distracts me i won't you think i have attention problems
[13780.04s -> 13797.42s]  in games now imagine with tts i would do tts maybe once or twice if it made sense and it was
[13797.42s -> 13823.10s]  something that was a major part of the stream okay so if you're a part of the group that he was
[13823.10s -> 13829.86s]  just with do you continue to walk this way or do you go holy shit and well it looks like
[13830.90s -> 13861.80s]  sure oh you wouldn't where do i go do one tts stream but do a children's puzzle i mean that
[13861.80s -> 13888.23s]  might be funny that might be fun can you press buttons do you say exit immediately why is he
[13888.23s -> 13916.62s]  kicking me out he's literally kicking me out that's not cool i can't take him with me okay

[13972.81s -> 13984.57s]  guy i even stepped the bastard on the med fees i thought this was a bad guy wait i did he think
[13984.57s -> 13990.97s]  he was going to take me to another prison he was haphazardly pointing the gun behind him
[13991.69s -> 13995.46s]  like he was looking in the backseat to like talk to kids in the backseat
[13996.10s -> 14012.79s]  he that wasn't was he good was it a turn i don't get it why wouldn't you just leave retic
[14014.57s -> 14024.22s]  why he come back here i guess you want to just shoot a missile into the window and leave
[14025.18s -> 14033.56s]  you'll probably you'll get him just hold a middle finger like right out the front window and shoot
[14033.72s -> 14034.36s]  make sure he sees
[14056.71s -> 14063.42s]  what the fuck is that device that chair doesn't make any sense that doesn't make that chair
[14063.42s -> 14066.94s]  i'm that's that's the most bizarre piece of architecture i've ever seen in a house
[14068.73s -> 14083.08s]  what is it what's the point of that why would you not go okay well here's the shotgun
[14085.02s -> 14088.14s]  i got a shotgun and i'm fighting his most intense unit
[14098.41s -> 14104.79s]  maximum security gamer room is what somebody just said and i cannot think of a more stupid
[14104.79s -> 14113.35s]  way to describe what we just watched maximum security gamer room i've got my two my two
[14113.35s -> 14130.41s]  gamer defense robots wasn't he just right here he can teleport thanks for for the last encounter
[14130.41s -> 14147.56s]  of the game showing me that things can disappear and teleport all right retic how do we get rid
[14147.56s -> 14232.98s]  of the sun my they can just see me now so you know hold the button down it overheats what
[14232.98s -> 14251.14s]  where's my what is it almost at the end of chapter one fog i find a pillar they teleport
[14251.14s -> 14317.75s]  should i just use the shotgun instead yeah okay that's just that's really cool where the hell is
[14327.02s -> 14351.18s]  uh god fucking damn it that one of them sucks one of them really really sucks so i can just
[14351.18s -> 14364.50s]  give it a one that really really really sucks first this one this guy's an idiot but it's so
[14364.50s -> 14384.47s]  easy that was so easy it should have been that easy i was holding i was holding the minigun down
[14384.47s -> 14394.46s]  what must be something wait there's no way to leave so he was just in there enclosed in this
[14394.46s -> 14402.81s]  little sphere oh shit hopefully they get him you wouldn't have a little back door
[14406.02s -> 14432.30s]  can you walk john i think so maybe how's your eyesight but now we're under arrest we're no we're
[14432.30s -> 14460.42s]  gonna know we're pretending to be arrested okay when they realize this who do you think blames
[14460.42s -> 14470.86s]  who for that one what do these guys just get on the next plane and leave just thinking that was
[14477.37s -> 14485.18s]  the guys clearly you have flashlights he's clearly tied to a chair with like a gag in his mouth
[14493.80s -> 14505.00s]  he wasn't bald well that's the end i won i only got medium
[14516.49s -> 14523.80s]  that's funny now do the sequel i'm not doing the whole sequel we'll check it out how about that
[14523.80s -> 14530.12s]  i'll check out the sequel i'm not i'm not doing it all i will i'll go into dark athena and i'll
[14530.12s -> 14563.22s]  look around i can't skip and i oh we just jumped right in what's how do i rate uh escape from well
[14563.22s -> 14576.98s]  here's the thing so dark athena is just essentially like a long dlc campaign just a remade which is
[14582.02s -> 14594.84s]  no one said that i said that because i did my research so it turns out we didn't make it out
[14600.34s -> 14617.11s]  no more of this i just want to look around all right if i can swim we'll play if i cannot swim
[14617.11s -> 14627.56s]  we won't play okay i have a feeling they added swimming to this one all right i'll see you later
[14645.02s -> 14648.54s]  red light on the door yeah i already know this i've this i played this
[14649.50s -> 14656.60s]  first x to go into stealth and crouch i just want to i want to kill one person
[14657.32s -> 14668.63s]  it's called eye shine i need to watch these movies i feel like i've been so lost
[14679.50s -> 14690.10s]  gemma gemma wait did he say kill me please or don't kill me please
[14690.82s -> 14706.39s]  i feel like that's really important what what first word is there he said play fall guys no
[14706.95s -> 14716.47s]  no he did not and even if he did i'm not sure i would do it oh oh i just want to look at the
[14716.55s -> 14717.19s]  extra content
[14748.39s -> 14761.99s]  wait when your palms what was that a new move in um i think i missed it it was just counter oh
[14761.99s -> 14773.64s]  okay making sure well this was fun i had fun playing uh britic i knew the game was worth
[14773.64s -> 14777.80s]  playing and it was worth playing i think it was fun i think i had a really good time playing it
[14778.52s -> 14792.68s]  you know what's funny though i there's not been one opportunity where i really
[14793.40s -> 14799.69s]  really needed to use the stealth like not the stealth the uh the drag the drag body thing
[14800.41s -> 14826.02s]  i'm supposed to go over here uh what let's play sonic adventure 2 on the dreamcast i didn't know
[14826.02s -> 14849.66s]  i already played sonic hold this great off okay while in stealth mode blue wait i had to wait
[14850.46s -> 14866.15s]  i had to wait this whole time oh this is wait whose gun is this am i holding this dude
[14866.87s -> 14895.56s]  i've got this dude hostage all right you're coming with me let's go hostage wow why was
[14895.56s -> 14929.98s]  this not in the first game this dude's dead what the guy is the gun that's that's actually pretty
[14929.98s -> 14946.09s]  cool i can't walk forward with him though that's kind of annoying uh it's a health kit i don't have
[14946.09s -> 14962.92s]  any you know that's a different mechanism i feel like that's probably more comfortable than the
[14962.92s -> 14986.54s]  last one stuff them in your inventory play fall guys i think that's a code they stay right there
[14986.54s -> 15007.30s]  hold on just stay right there for a minute hey you guys really want to see fall guys really
