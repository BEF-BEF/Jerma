[5.11s -> 9.59s]  So I just recently beat Firewatch, and I came across a feature that I haven't really seen
[9.59s -> 14.65s]  very many people talk about. There's a disposable camera in this game that allows you to take
[14.65s -> 18.82s]  pictures. You can take a picture of whatever you want. It never leaves your inventory,
[18.82s -> 24.38s]  and you have it throughout the whole game. But the cool feature is they actually ask you if you want
[24.38s -> 30.41s]  to develop those photos, and they will mail them to you. And that's exactly what I did. They got
[30.41s -> 33.77s]  here today, and I kind of want to just go through them with you guys, like I thought it'd be a really
[33.77s -> 40.60s]  neat idea to look at them together and see what I took pictures of. Now, it has been a while,
[40.60s -> 46.76s]  so I don't actually know or remember what's on these. Hey, your memories have arrived, huh?
[46.76s -> 53.35s]  That's real cute. Photo dome. Look at that. Okay, let's open them up. Let's see what we got.
[54.55s -> 68.10s]  First one is the sky. Skies can be cool sometimes, I guess. That's a rock. A pretty interesting
[68.10s -> 74.54s]  growth of a rock. The way that it was growing out of the ground was pretty cool. I think that's the
[74.54s -> 86.02s]  inside of a bush. Yeah, that's the inside of a bush. I think I was trying to take a picture of a...
[90.98s -> 102.62s]  These are fucking terrible. Seriously. What? Did I take these? What even is this? Is that a thumb
[102.62s -> 108.47s]  print? Oh, there we go. There's a little selfie there, you know, selfie action. Sometimes you
[108.47s -> 120.79s]  gotta take one. Okay, that's a private one. That's gonna go in a different pile. It's gonna go in
[120.79s -> 128.60s]  the privacy pile. Hey, a fence. Take a look at that. Interesting, right? It's a... What am I even
[128.60s -> 136.25s]  taking a picture of here? Hey, here you go. I got a picture of the toilet, you know. Oh, this one's
[136.25s -> 139.61s]  great. I like this one. This one's like, there was a rock on a stump, and I thought like, whoa, that's
[139.61s -> 144.09s]  such an interesting rock. Like, that's so odd. Why would there be a rock on a stump like that?
[144.73s -> 157.88s]  Uh, I don't know why. There is a box up there, I guess. Ooh, here we go. Here we go. I remember
[157.88s -> 162.52s]  this tree. I remember saying to myself, man, it's got such interesting moss growing on the side. I
[162.52s -> 180.71s]  gotta get a picture with it. So there you go. There it is. Privacy pile. Damn it. What the fuck?
[182.98s -> 196.01s]  Who am I? I don't know who the fuck this is. I have no idea. I've never met this person before
[196.01s -> 207.03s]  in my entire life. Another rock. Good one. Oh, look, another rock. Oh, cool. And it's a sunset
[207.03s -> 213.99s]  that you could have taken a picture of too. Oh, good rock in the way. Come on. Come on. You know
[213.99s -> 231.30s]  what? I apologize for this. Oh, my God. That's somebody's asshole. I hope it's not mine. No,
[231.30s -> 238.06s]  that's mine. That's mine. Do something cool. Oh, look at that. I did something cool, guys.
[239.66s -> 252.46s]  Hey, Ma. Don't look in the trash.
