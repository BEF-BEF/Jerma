[1.46s -> 47.88s]  Hi guys, welcome back. Those of you that joined us yesterday, we're going to be continuing. Sit down, sit down. Someone's standing on their desk back there. Get sit down. Calling your fucking mom to tell her about all the things you do wrong here in this room. I'm going to do item shop again. Reset here. Receipt here. Part two. I'm having a lot of fun. We are our newest hurdle we have to climb up here is
[47.88s -> 152.15s]  $200,000. I don't know. I almost didn't do the last one. $80,000 seems very difficult to go over. I'm going to do my best to try to get past $200,000. But anyways, relax, stretch your legs out. Stretch your back out. We'll be going very shortly. See you in two seconds. Mouse off screen. I already know. So here I freaked out. And this is a day. Imagine you can do this to shit in real life.
[152.15s -> 198.79s]  Wait, my bills are due. My bills are due on the 21st. Hold on. Let me go through the whole day and try to make as much money and try to like sell stuff as fast as I possibly can. And then did I do it tomorrow? If only that were possible. IRL or in the game? Well, I mean like IRL. You could do that in real life. Well, the idea is you try to pay your bills on time and not have a fantasy of freezing time to be able to pay your bills in one day.
[198.79s -> 245.25s]  Anyways, procrastination. That's not that that's really bad procrastination. I understand like not brushing your teeth for a day and like waiting until 730 p.m. before you like fuck. I probably should brush my teeth. That's procrastination. Waiting until 1159 the day before your bills are due. That's irresponsibility. Let's just come on. Let's just call it. Come on. Anyway, here's our shop.
[245.25s -> 290.67s]  You see on the 29th, we owe $200,000. We got a long way to go. So what the hell? What was the last thing I did? Let's see. Yes. And those look, we have a whole new slew of people that are going to come to the stream. And we I know it is an animated Japanese style television game. But just give it a minute. Because I know you just heard that. You heard that sound and you were just like, I'm out of here. But just wait. This game is very fun. Just give it a minute.
[290.67s -> 339.71s]  We gave it a few minutes yesterday. We gave it actually seven and a half hours yesterday. It was worth it. Turn the voice off. I'm gonna get shit for this. But I turned. I turned the voice down since yesterday. I didn't think anybody was gonna notice and you probably wouldn't have noticed except for somebody said that they could hear it. That's all right. That's a decent level. Oh, god damn it. There. That's better. All right. See, you're fine. Anyways, we're
[339.71s -> 388.85s]  the whole point of this game. If you weren't here yesterday is you got to buy high sell low. You got to bind items. You got to put them in your store and then people buy them and you got to haggle with them. So what's what was the last thing that happened here? We just got the new day here. I'm gonna put the wooden chess piece here. Wait, wait, I just I just didn't get a really expensive fucking item. I did right here. $15,000. There was other things. All right, all this shit. I want to hear the voices. I did. They're fine. I turned it back up.
[388.85s -> 435.50s]  Necklace. All right, I think I'm ready to I can't I couldn't I can't craft anything else. All right, I'm gonna hold on to this shit. Here we go. Time to open the store. Oh, charm. Welcome. Hey, girl. Heaven. Are you ever not bright and happy? Nope. A bright and happy welcome is a key to sales. Good products is a key to sales. I got a present for you. Oh, shit. We just got a new fucking hero card. Wait, there's a 60 second slow mode on right now.
[435.50s -> 488.74s]  That's pretty slow. Hold on. Wait, let me fix it. How about uh, how about uh, 15? 20? What did I just do? Oh shit. I did something wrong. I think I just broke it. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh.
[488.74s -> 538.18s]  Uh oh. There is now no slow mode. And we got 10 seconds slow mode. We got it. I think. Yeah, I think I like turned it off. All right, we're good. We're good. We got a card. I was wondering why I didn't see any POG champs over here. We got a fucking R2D2 card and I looked over and I didn't see any POG champs. I was like, what's going on here? There's gonna be like 2000 of them. Damn straight. If you ever need the help of a professional Burke such as myself, give me a look. Going to negative slow mode. You can't do that.
[538.18s -> 583.63s]  So are we, are we dumping uh, this dude in here right now? What's his name? Louie? Do a six hour slow mode. You know, I thought about doing a stream before of having a permanent slow mode, like 12 hours or something. So you get to say one thing in chat and you better make it come. Do it. Do it. No, that has to be something that's planned. Not during recetteer and item shops. Actually, that's a pretty great time to do it. No, it's not. I want to get. No, no. I want real feedback of stuff.
[583.63s -> 635.55s]  I'm selling and buying. Well, receipts been good to me. Consider it my way of paying guys back. All right, we got a new card. By the way, for those of you that weren't here yesterday, when you get a card from somebody, it means that they had to buy them for everybody in the class because so everybody gets a valentine in the class. So you have like 20 cards and you have to hand them out to everybody. Even if you might not want to hand them out to everybody, your mother still tells you to do that. And you're like, ah, I guess come on.
[635.55s -> 676.74s]  I didn't get one. I only wanted to get my valentine to like my two friends in the class so we could like make jokes on the cards. I couldn't make jokes. Are you really just some random dispassionate loan shark? You should have undid slow mode to max out the minus twos. Yeah, hold on a minute. That's bullshit.
[676.74s -> 698.94s]  10 seconds slow mode. Usually it's like 20 to 30 seconds slow mode. I'm getting dumped here. This is fucking market manipulation at its finest. Anyways, let's go.
[698.94s -> 709.12s]  I've been wondering if all you're really after is getting that loan repaid. Wouldn't it not be a lot easier to steal the house and cash out? Nothing's stopping you after all except for one thing, the law.
[709.12s -> 721.75s]  That is not it at all. As an agent of Terme, I take a little bit of friendly advice. The harder you try to spin some elaborate tale, the worse it ends up being when the web comes apart at the end.
[721.75s -> 742.56s]  Not that I have any room to lecture on anyone on that front. So sticking to your guns just a loan shark then? Unbelievable! Did you give her your card just to ask me that? Maybe I did. Guess I've been a bit of a busybody, eh?
[742.56s -> 765.31s]  Everyone who comes through that door is like that. That girl. Something about her inspires people to care. I suppose she does that. Are you going to buy something or what? Well then let me know if you need my help. Hey, thanks again.
[765.31s -> 790.16s]  So thank you for all that. I appreciate the card. Now let's sell something. What can I help you with? I want some food. I got plenty of food. Ooh, holy shit, I got honey. No, no, no, no. This girl's cheap. She won't spend $2,300 on that.
[790.16s -> 822.18s]  Let's go the, let's go the egg toast. $600. That's too much, right? You don't pay over it for anything. She never pays more than like 99% over. She's back again. Alright, I want the fish too. No, no, no. She wants to sell this to me.
[822.18s -> 868.02s]  45% of base, take it or lose. Yes, I'm not going anywhere. Avocado toast. Stop letting her do this. Alright, Miss Capitalist, in two days I want you to get two scarves for me. I don't know if I can do that. I have to buy them. No, there we go.
[868.02s -> 908.30s]  I put an order for, uh oh. Probably should have checked that before we started. Should I reload? Yeah, but then we have to do that whole scene again. I would have done, but hold on, this guy's, are we going to get this, this guy's about to drop 15 grand. Should I reset it?
[908.30s -> 944.33s]  No, that's my own fault. I fucked that up. I need to be a better store owner. Um, this is a big sale here though. We have like 20, 20,000? No, he's not going to pay 200% for this. I'm going to start at 21. Alright, I got to go down.
[944.33s -> 988.48s]  Shit, uh, 19, 19.5? No, no, it's got to be like 18. Got it. There it goes. Uh, I sold it. Could use a treasure. Do I have any treasure? Eh. I mean, could I just, this is technically a treasure, isn't it? Could I be like, what can I interest you in one of these?
[989.66s -> 1034.00s]  I guess you have to get a statue. 128. It's not under the treasure tab. It's not a treasure. I see, I see. Makes sense. You have a bracelet. I do. I have a really good bracelet actually, don't I? You're not going to, no. She's not going to pay 2600 bucks for this.
[1034.00s -> 1077.78s]  28. Ah, why did I even try to sell it to you? 25, 26. She does, she doesn't, she never buys anything. Alright, I need to, I got to take some stock here. Hold on. What do we have for orders? So tomorrow, I need two weapons and two foodstuffs by tomorrow.
[1077.78s -> 1126.43s]  What do I, I need weapons. Alright, let's go get some weapons. If I was an item in this game, I'd be under the treasure tab. Oh, what? That was so cute. Thank you. Alright, hold on. Let's go to fusion. I need a staff. Alright, bat wings. Backscratcher and impetition staff. I don't have any free honey. I only have one. Can't do that anymore. What else have we got here?
[1126.43s -> 1162.42s]  Ooh, the price is currently down on this, but I do have a charred lizard. I have a shell necklace. I could get a shell necklace right now. It's from the other store, right? Let's do it. Wait, wait, wait. I need, no, no, no. I need, no, you're right. I need this for the dude. Fuck. It's alright. I need two weapons then.
[1162.42s -> 1191.08s]  I'm going to say, um, let's go with the expensive shit. Let's go with the thief's knife and steel sword. I'm going to make cash tonight. And then I need two foodstuffs. I think I already have it. Let's go to the pub. Sit down and find out what we need to do.
[1191.08s -> 1211.77s]  Ah, she's drunk. Ah, silly fairy. You can't schtick a person in a cup. Maybe I could stuff you into one though. Hee-tee-hee. You aren't shumadish. Are you drunk or are you doing a Sean Connery impression? I don't understand.
[1213.78s -> 1221.51s]  I believe I shall pass. Oh, well, you're lost then. You're schtick in the mud. Maybe Rosetta wants shum.
[1224.93s -> 1233.30s]  What is this? Stop clinging to her for heaven's sake. I swear for professional Burke. You could not hold your liquor at all.
[1235.75s -> 1237.75s]  What, you again? I told you no.
[1240.02s -> 1241.02s]  What is?
[1241.02s -> 1245.66s]  Come on, can't a guy get a break? Cut me just a little slack here.
[1245.66s -> 1255.94s]  Not just no, but hell no. Do you have any idea how long your tab already is? You'll drink me out of a business at this rate.
[1255.94s -> 1261.94s]  A son of a... All right, all right. I can take a hint. I'll call it for the day.
[1261.94s -> 1266.08s]  Who's that guy? Oh, what an argument.
[1266.08s -> 1277.44s]  Oh, him? That happens all the time. That guy keeps putting stuff on his tab and doesn't pay up, so he keeps getting chased out.
[1279.38s -> 1289.63s]  I think he even has Louis beat when he comes to be... What? Oh, okay, hold on. I think he even has Louis beat when it comes to being poor.
[1289.63s -> 1295.03s]  Well, either way, why don't worry too much about it.
[1295.03s -> 1300.40s]  The unwise use of money is the human trade, which I find the most perplexing by far.
[1300.40s -> 1311.14s]  Unwise-ish of... Well, anyway, come on, Rosetta. Your big sis wants to introduce you to a man named Jack.
[1311.14s -> 1314.15s]  Oh, absolutely not.
[1314.15s -> 1330.94s]  The plaza in the evening feels kind of lonely. It makes you think it's really time to go home now.
[1330.94s -> 1335.99s]  You really think it has that effect? I don't feel... Oh, it does.
[1335.99s -> 1340.99s]  Oh, the smell of the evening... I thought that said piss. It makes it even lonelier.
[1340.99s -> 1346.00s]  Well, as a fairy, I cannot pretend to understand how smell could make you lonely.
[1346.00s -> 1353.02s]  But our dinner tonight is going to be salted porridge. It certainly will not be pie.
[1353.02s -> 1359.67s]  Salted porridge? That's like the default gross food, isn't it?
[1359.67s -> 1364.62s]  That's the stuff that comes out of an ice cream scoop in every movie.
[1364.62s -> 1369.21s]  Oh, man, now I really feel lonely for some reason.
[1369.21s -> 1384.61s]  College life dinner. No, they don't serve that in college dining halls.
[1384.61s -> 1392.45s]  You don't line up and have them hand out your tray and somebody dumps porridge onto the tray.
[1392.45s -> 1397.54s]  That's not a school I don't think I want to be at.
[1397.54s -> 1418.26s]  What? What school did you go to where they did a line of porridge? Like Oliver Twist?
[1419.26s -> 1446.29s]  All right, let's go. I need to make some money here.
[1446.29s -> 1449.74s]  So I need... What do they want?
[1449.74s -> 1453.74s]  I needed two weapons, which I have, and then two foodstuffs, right?
[1453.74s -> 1459.34s]  I think I already have that. I do. I have two pieces of food, don't I? Yeah, I do.
[1459.34s -> 1465.03s]  Not even 9%. Scaves? What's a scave? Scarves.
[1465.03s -> 1469.03s]  Sca... How do you say scarves? Scarves? I thought scarves.
[1469.03s -> 1485.01s]  It's got staff and stave. That's what screws me up. Why? Staff, stave.
[1485.01s -> 1502.31s]  Scarf, scaves. I could just do two shitty ones. Yeah, let's get the expensive one.
[1502.31s -> 1509.85s]  All right, I'm ready. Am I enjoying the game? I think the game's great.
[1509.85s -> 1522.46s]  I want... Let's put the helm out there. I have enough food, right? Yeah, I do.
[1522.46s -> 1538.07s]  Oh, hey, welcome. Hey, Rosette, listen to this. Why do you... Are you still, like, drunk?
[1538.07s -> 1543.57s]  It's been, like, fucking 12 hours. What is it? And are you okay? You seem a little different.
[1543.57s -> 1548.26s]  So, I got a message from the guild today.
[1548.26s -> 1553.43s]  They totally found a new dungeon with Shumshishish.
[1553.43s -> 1559.74s]  Nobody does that when they're drunk. I don't know why everybody decided to take
[1559.74s -> 1565.29s]  that one old Looney Tunes cartoon of the mouse, going like...
[1565.29s -> 1574.82s]  Everybody just copied it. That doesn't happen. Really, really super, really.
[1574.82s -> 1579.96s]  Everyone is calling it the Amber Garden.
[1579.96s -> 1584.76s]  Boy, I hope it's that kind of amber.
[1597.48s -> 1602.48s]  There's a line here I'm crossing where I'm starting to turn into Little Nicky.
[1603.78s -> 1611.67s]  Oh, what was I talking about? Oh, yeah, so if you get the chance, we should totally go.
[1611.67s -> 1619.80s]  I mean, who knows what kind of items we could find. Yeah, items. Yeah, that's true.
[1619.80s -> 1626.50s]  Well, then, back to the pub with me. Fwoosh. Oh, the Joker.
[1626.50s -> 1636.52s]  Yeah, that could be the Joker, too. A new dungeon, huh?
[1636.52s -> 1640.52s]  Ooh, unlocked. Start buying shit.
[1641.52s -> 1656.18s]  Candy Apple. 2000. Back. You want the helm.
[1656.18s -> 1660.94s]  Now that, I'm sorry, but that's 2300. Make it a little cheaper.
[1660.94s -> 1666.56s]  That's a very rare item. It's a warrior's helm. Thank you.
[1666.56s -> 1676.42s]  Yeah, I sold the warrior's helm. Looking for something?
[1676.42s -> 1682.72s]  Oh, the more I look at this, the more I just need to have it. What's your toll in filthy...
[1682.72s -> 1687.60s]  Do you buy stuff or are you cheap or what?
[1687.60s -> 1691.97s]  A little less. 720.
[1691.97s -> 1701.48s]  Oh, fuck off. Egg. Pick this one. What do you mean egg?
[1701.48s -> 1705.87s]  This guy's getting ready to fight. All right, well, hold on.
[1705.87s -> 1709.94s]  He's either getting ready to fight or play a game of hockey.
[1709.94s -> 1712.94s]  These items could be used for hockey as well. That makes sense.
[1712.94s -> 1727.51s]  All right, let's do 1000. Same thing.
[1727.51s -> 1732.39s]  Two food stuffs. Oh, wait. Yes, I can do two food stuffs in two days.
[1732.39s -> 1744.34s]  Here's the end of the day. He's ready to go fight Grandma's ghost.
[1744.34s -> 1755.13s]  Hey, can you turn her voice off and also the game, please?
[1755.13s -> 1757.56s]  That's just not going to happen.
[1757.56s -> 1763.34s]  News! The price of daggers has increased. Ooh.
[1763.34s -> 1776.49s]  The price of daggers has increased. And I got two. This is going to be insane.
[1776.49s -> 1781.75s]  Hold on. I need to... I'm going to sell these on the floor.
[1781.75s -> 1791.65s]  Somebody wants... Hold on. I'm buying some stupid shitty item.
[1791.65s -> 1792.82s]  Wait, what?
[1792.82s -> 1796.64s]  I have a little problem, but I need your help where...
[1796.64s -> 1799.64s]  We automatically refuse to place horse heads in anyone's bed.
[1799.64s -> 1805.10s]  I would like a fucking, like, nine-year-old know what that is.
[1805.10s -> 1811.46s]  Oh, no, nothing like that. Actually, I have a package that needs to be delivered to the orphanage near the town square.
[1811.46s -> 1814.46s]  You've seen it, right? I'm a bit busy right now, so...
[1814.46s -> 1816.46s]  Oh, yeah, sure. We can do that.
[1816.46s -> 1818.46s]  Thanks, girls. This will help me out.
[1818.46s -> 1821.70s]  All right, then. Package acquired. Charge forth.
[1821.70s -> 1823.70s]  Indeed, not a bad idea.
[1823.70s -> 1831.35s]  The merchant's guilt has been generous to us in the past, so getting them into our pocket now will only help us down the road.
[1831.35s -> 1834.59s]  In you are now. Wait. Wait a minute.
[1834.59s -> 1837.58s]  For the orphans. Let's go!
[1837.58s -> 1839.58s]  Now hold on a second here, girls.
[1839.58s -> 1845.66s]  Thank you. I hope everyone enjoys the package.
[1845.66s -> 1848.66s]  Delivery successful. Forward to Janus.
[1848.66s -> 1850.66s]  Now hold on a minute here, girls.
[1850.66s -> 1853.97s]  Well, I'm glad we were able to... By the way, yeah, I did read that out loud.
[1853.97s -> 1857.85s]  Well, I am glad we were able to get that done with quickly.
[1857.85s -> 1860.66s]  I'll say, everyone seemed to like the package.
[1860.66s -> 1866.97s]  Although, what do you think they'll do with, I mean, just the...
[1866.97s -> 1871.17s]  Honestly, I would rather not think of it. What's in the package?
[1871.17s -> 1874.17s]  Blasted Guild Master, I think I would have preferred the horse head.
[1874.17s -> 1878.24s]  Well, either way, we pulled it off. Back to the shop.
[1878.24s -> 1881.99s]  Is the shop gonna be, like, on fire or something? I don't understand.
[1881.99s -> 1883.68s]  What's up?
[1883.68s -> 1889.06s]  It may be nothing. Over there, however, is that not...
[1889.06s -> 1892.62s]  It's the man with the huge bar bill, isn't it?
[1892.62s -> 1896.56s]  Yes, but why on earth is he hiding behind a wall?
[1896.56s -> 1901.51s]  Hey, yeah, that's suspicious.
[1901.51s -> 1904.51s]  The four...
[1904.51s -> 1905.51s]  Yay!
[1905.51s -> 1908.29s]  Wait, receipt!
[1908.29s -> 1916.99s]  Hold it! You there!
[1916.99s -> 1918.99s]  Seize whatever vaguely sneaky thing you're doing at once!
[1918.99s -> 1921.32s]  Whoa!
[1921.32s -> 1926.01s]  This is an orphanage. What are you doing here, appearing at it like that?
[1926.01s -> 1928.89s]  What? Mind telling me who you are?
[1928.89s -> 1932.58s]  My name is Receit. I run the item shop, Receit, on the hill.
[1932.58s -> 1936.58s]  I was on my way home from delivering a package, and I saw you being off-neeking!
[1936.58s -> 1939.01s]  Oh, you're the one who runs that whole...
[1939.01s -> 1941.44s]  Pretty impressive at your age.
[1941.44s -> 1944.64s]  We seem to have gotten off to a bad start.
[1944.64s -> 1946.64s]  Name's Elan.
[1946.64s -> 1950.20s]  In the strictest terms, I guess you could call me an adventurer.
[1950.20s -> 1953.89s]  I kind of owe something to this orphanage, so I stop by Elan.
[1953.89s -> 1958.41s]  Why all the sneakification and peering then?
[1958.41s -> 1962.10s]  I wasn't peering, really. I was more gazing at...
[1962.10s -> 1964.10s]  I guess with guilt.
[1964.10s -> 1967.17s]  What? What are you...?
[1967.17s -> 1970.34s]  Times have been a little hard lately. You know how it can be.
[1970.34s -> 1973.71s]  I can't afford to buy the kids who live their traits anymore.
[1973.71s -> 1978.14s]  So I think to myself, it'd just be better if I didn't show up at all.
[1978.14s -> 1979.45s]  But still...
[1979.45s -> 1982.33s]  Oh, I see. I'm sorry I was angry at you, but...
[1982.33s -> 1987.96s]  Hey! Oh, it's Elan! Elan's here! He's got treats!
[1987.96s -> 1991.52s]  Oh, shit! Oh, hell's bells!
[1991.52s -> 1996.59s]  Now they've seen me. Let me... little girl... Do you have any treats?
[1996.59s -> 1998.59s]  Gotta let them down and go in empty-handed, I guess.
[2000.73s -> 2001.73s]  It'll be okay.
[2001.73s -> 2003.72s]  Huh?
[2003.72s -> 2006.90s]  Look at them. The kids appreciate you, not the gifts.
[2006.90s -> 2012.93s]  Yeah, kind of weird for a merchant to say you don't need gifts, I guess.
[2012.93s -> 2017.13s]  But it's true, really. Go on, they're waiting.
[2017.13s -> 2020.29s]  Little miss.
[2020.29s -> 2025.73s]  Come play with us, Elan. I'm gonna be the guard, okay? You're the thief.
[2025.73s -> 2028.06s]  Aye.
[2028.06s -> 2031.49s]  You're fans await, Mr. Elan. Good luck.
[2031.49s -> 2034.49s]  Oh, maybe you should go easy on the alcohol, too.
[2034.49s -> 2035.49s]  For their sake.
[2038.39s -> 2039.39s]  She sure told me!
[2039.39s -> 2043.68s]  Reset of Resetti!
[2043.68s -> 2045.24s]  Huh.
[2045.24s -> 2050.19s]  Go easy on the alcohol.
[2050.19s -> 2056.19s]  Was it my imagination, or was that a fairy giving me a hell of an evil eye just now?
[2056.19s -> 2060.14s]  That's not the correct voice for that guy. It's gotta be lighter.
[2060.14s -> 2063.30s]  I guess that's the wrong voice.
[2063.30s -> 2076.39s]  Hi, are you okay, miss? You look kinda down.
[2076.39s -> 2081.82s]  Oh, Resett, I'm tired for some reason. I wonder if I'm starting to get old and slow.
[2081.82s -> 2085.51s]  If you're tired, it can help to eat something sweet.
[2085.51s -> 2087.51s]  Don't do that.
[2087.51s -> 2093.46s]  Sugar stimulates your parasympathetic nervous system and energizes you.
[2093.46s -> 2099.70s]  That sounds like big company propaganda is what that sounds like, little miss.
[2099.70s -> 2101.70s]  I don't know where you got that bullshit from.
[2101.70s -> 2109.61s]  Anyway, you should go eat something sweet. Like, for example, candy or canned peaches.
[2109.61s -> 2115.58s]  We have a lot of sweet stuff to choose from.
[2115.58s -> 2120.58s]  That does sound good. Maybe I'll have some chocolate cake.
[2120.58s -> 2127.30s]  Thanks for the advice, you two.
[2127.30s -> 2145.48s]  Oh, cake. Now I'm jealous. Business opportunity.
[2145.48s -> 2147.48s]  Imagine going to the doctor and being like, yeah, something's wrong.
[2147.48s -> 2149.48s]  I'm really fucking tired all the time.
[2149.48s -> 2155.91s]  I kinda feel like shit. I'm sleepy in the morning. I don't have really any energy.
[2155.91s -> 2157.91s]  I'm a little bit down.
[2157.91s -> 2159.91s]  Oh, well, you should eat just a cake.
[2159.91s -> 2162.74s]  What?
[2162.74s -> 2172.27s]  Yeah, just eat a cake. See you in a few months when you come back for something else.
[2172.27s -> 2174.27s]  You don't think I should probably start exercising?
[2174.27s -> 2176.27s]  No, just eat candy out of a jar.
[2176.27s -> 2184.87s]  That's the kind of scenario where all of a sudden they've done comedy routines where then that doctor is arrested.
[2184.87s -> 2186.87s]  And it's like, holy shit, that guy's pretending to be the doctor.
[2186.87s -> 2191.06s]  And the real doctor is in the back, tied up or something.
[2191.06s -> 2198.35s]  They've done that before, right?
[2198.35s -> 2200.35s]  Alright, let me see. What do I have to do today?
[2200.35s -> 2207.37s]  Today is two weapons, two food stuffs.
[2207.37s -> 2212.02s]  I have the scarves. I have all the food. I have everything I need.
[2212.02s -> 2213.02s]  I got everything I need.
[2213.02s -> 2218.90s]  Oh, but wait, wait, wait. Not quite true, though. Hold on.
[2218.90s -> 2223.90s]  I want to put these out on the floor because I can sell them for way, way more than they're worth.
[2223.90s -> 2230.70s]  And then I'm going to get two shitty weapons and then overprice the fuck out of them when they come in to buy them.
[2230.70s -> 2236.82s]  Or should I overprice the fuck out of these in the order?
[2236.82s -> 2247.82s]  I wonder. Alright, I'll put them in the order.
[2247.82s -> 2251.25s]  Let's get the necklace out there. What else do I got?
[2251.25s -> 2254.45s]  Nobody buys the rings.
[2254.45s -> 2257.29s]  Alright, that seems good.
[2257.29s -> 2260.29s]  Let me just make sure I got plenty of food.
[2260.29s -> 2262.29s]  I got the two weapons. I'm ready to go.
[2262.29s -> 2268.18s]  Let's get an orange up there, too.
[2268.18s -> 2270.18s]  Here we go.
[2270.18s -> 2275.27s]  Oh, hello there, receipt. Still manning the store, as always, I see.
[2275.27s -> 2278.27s]  Hi, Aluette. You look like you're in a good...
[2278.27s -> 2280.27s]  That was fucking loud.
[2280.27s -> 2283.27s]  I don't know why. That just scared the shit out of me.
[2283.27s -> 2286.51s]  But anyways, thank you.
[2286.51s -> 2288.51s]  I thought that was in the game.
[2288.51s -> 2291.07s]  That was fifty dollars.
[2291.07s -> 2294.02s]  And that was...
[2294.02s -> 2297.02s]  Iniuria Palace.
[2297.02s -> 2300.58s]  Iniuria Palace.
[2300.58s -> 2301.58s]  For fifty bucks.
[2301.58s -> 2305.16s]  Thank you so much.
[2305.16s -> 2307.16s]  They say, hey, Jerma, love you a lot.
[2307.16s -> 2310.16s]  Thank you for all the years of helping me get through tough shit with laughter.
[2310.16s -> 2314.98s]  Show love a thousand five times.
[2314.98s -> 2321.38s]  Thank you so much for the fifty dollars.
[2321.38s -> 2323.38s]  Much love to you. That's fucking a lot of money. Thank you.
[2323.38s -> 2328.48s]  And not to derail this, but somebody just said they went to...
[2328.48s -> 2329.48s]  I'm not even going to say it.
[2329.48s -> 2333.62s]  Because that's going to derail the whole stream for like the rest of the night.
[2333.62s -> 2337.62s]  I am. Father and I are going on an excursion to eat foie gras in a bit.
[2337.62s -> 2346.30s]  What's a foie gras?
[2346.30s -> 2348.98s]  It sounds kind of mean.
[2348.98s -> 2350.98s]  What? You don't know what foie gras is?
[2350.98s -> 2352.98s]  Poverty is a curse.
[2352.98s -> 2355.42s]  Auteer, help me out over here.
[2355.42s -> 2360.62s]  Yes, very well.
[2360.62s -> 2367.57s]  Foie gras is a food made from goose liver and is generally considered to be a high class dish,
[2367.57s -> 2369.57s]  due in part to what is involved in creating it.
[2369.57s -> 2374.57s]  By overfeeding the geese, excess fat accumulates in the liver, significantly changing the taste.
[2374.57s -> 2379.57s]  The process is lengthy, naturally, as a dish that is typically sauteed and then eaten.
[2379.57s -> 2383.73s]  Okay, is it yummy though?
[2383.73s -> 2386.73s]  Naturally, it's a delicacy of the upper crust after all.
[2386.73s -> 2390.29s]  It utterly lacks any texture.
[2390.29s -> 2392.29s]  It's strangely meaty and oily.
[2392.29s -> 2394.29s]  It's truly the ultimate in rare tastes.
[2394.29s -> 2396.78s]  But it's yummy, right?
[2396.78s -> 2400.86s]  Of course it is. Silly plebeian.
[2400.86s -> 2405.53s]  Why can't we just eat shit?
[2405.53s -> 2417.60s]  We're going to find all these fucked up ways to make food.
[2417.60s -> 2420.97s]  How bored are we as a society?
[2420.97s -> 2425.47s]  Oh, hi, welcome.
[2425.47s -> 2427.47s]  Do you have a hat?
[2427.47s -> 2431.14s]  I actually don't have any hats.
[2437.70s -> 2438.70s]  Society.
[2438.70s -> 2444.70s]  No, I'm sorry the word society has taken on this like meme terminology now.
[2444.70s -> 2447.70s]  If you say the word society, it's like, oh, he said society.
[2447.70s -> 2448.70s]  He said society.
[2448.70s -> 2451.96s]  He said it.
[2451.96s -> 2457.42s]  I don't have any hats.
[2457.42s -> 2458.42s]  I'm sorry.
[2458.42s -> 2463.95s]  No, it's okay.
[2463.95s -> 2465.95s]  If you don't have any, you don't.
[2465.95s -> 2472.25s]  Hi there.
[2472.25s -> 2476.22s]  Oh, do you want to sell you this bread?
[2476.22s -> 2478.22s]  31 cents.
[2478.22s -> 2479.22s]  It's bread.
[2479.22s -> 2489.65s]  I don't want to buy you bread.
[2489.65s -> 2493.74s]  Oh, here we go.
[2493.74s -> 2494.92s]  Okay.
[2494.92s -> 2496.92s]  So we got an opportunity to make 10 grand.
[2496.92s -> 2505.28s]  150, 15,000.
[2505.28s -> 2507.10s]  50K.
[2507.10s -> 2509.10s]  That's not going to fly.
[2509.10s -> 2517.99s]  No, that no way.
[2517.99s -> 2521.17s]  I'll start at 150.
[2521.17s -> 2522.17s]  Whoops.
[2522.17s -> 2523.17s]  No, not one, two, three, four.
[2523.17s -> 2526.17s]  How about one, two, three, four, five?
[2526.17s -> 2536.52s]  I think I could do 150.
[2536.52s -> 2537.52s]  That's a, come on.
[2537.52s -> 2539.52s]  That's 150 percent.
[2539.52s -> 2543.17s]  She will back out immediately if it's too high.
[2543.17s -> 2544.17s]  That's right.
[2544.17s -> 2549.67s]  That's a really good price for that ring.
[2549.67s -> 2551.67s]  I got that ring for like six grand.
[2551.67s -> 2557.50s]  Hey, do you have my food stuff?
[2557.50s -> 2558.50s]  I do.
[2558.50s -> 2560.57s]  Let's see.
[2560.57s -> 2562.57s]  How can I get the maximum amount of money from you?
[2562.57s -> 2566.57s]  I'm going to hold on to the honey because I feel like I'm going to need it in some recipe
[2566.57s -> 2567.57s]  somewhere.
[2567.57s -> 2572.34s]  Candy, apple, and then a beef brain.
[2572.34s -> 2573.34s]  Perfect.
[2573.34s -> 2576.16s]  That'll be 6,000.
[2576.16s -> 2589.37s]  I wonder if you'll do it.
[2589.37s -> 2596.36s]  Slightly, I want a slightly better deal.
[2596.36s -> 2601.74s]  54, 5,000.
[2601.74s -> 2606.30s]  Yes.
[2606.30s -> 2609.57s]  Inching close to 200k.
[2609.57s -> 2614.33s]  We have another delivery.
[2614.33s -> 2616.33s]  It's the weapons, right?
[2616.33s -> 2619.53s]  Do you want a yam?
[2619.53s -> 2623.77s]  I will take that yam for like 600 bucks.
[2623.77s -> 2625.77s]  No, that's insulting.
[2625.77s -> 2626.77s]  700.
[2626.77s -> 2631.70s]  I'm getting, you're getting scammed.
[2631.70s -> 2633.70s]  I'm not getting scammed.
[2636.83s -> 2639.80s]  All right.
[2639.80s -> 2642.19s]  Weapons.
[2642.19s -> 2644.19s]  Thief's knife and craft is knife.
[2644.19s -> 2652.46s]  And this is where we get, this is where we get to be a really bad person because
[2652.46s -> 2655.46s]  these things are in hot demand right now and it's an order.
[2655.46s -> 2659.46s]  So I'm thinking like, I'm thinking like 15,000 dollars.
[2659.46s -> 2668.46s]  14,000, I think.
[2668.46s -> 2676.36s]  All right.
[2676.36s -> 2677.36s]  Okay.
[2677.36s -> 2678.36s]  All right.
[2678.36s -> 2682.16s]  All right.
[2682.16s -> 2684.62s]  All right.
[2684.62s -> 2685.62s]  All right.
[2685.62s -> 2686.62s]  12,000.
[2686.62s -> 2689.90s]  Fuck.
[2689.90s -> 2690.90s]  No.
[2690.90s -> 2704.09s]  Those items are in fucking hot demand.
[2704.09s -> 2707.09s]  In your palace gave another 50 bucks.
[2707.09s -> 2712.17s]  You butchered my name.
[2712.17s -> 2715.17s]  So here's money to go back to school.
[2715.17s -> 2718.60s]  I am so bad with names.
[2718.60s -> 2721.60s]  Thank you for the hundred dollars though, dude, for real.
[2721.60s -> 2728.66s]  That's a shitload of money.
[2728.66s -> 2729.66s]  Thank you.
[2729.66s -> 2731.74s]  I want a hat.
[2731.74s -> 2732.74s]  I don't have hats.
[2732.74s -> 2739.97s]  What's that robots deal?
[2739.97s -> 2742.40s]  He's usually 250 to 300.
[2742.40s -> 2744.77s]  Oh, that's not good.
[2744.77s -> 2746.77s]  Get him off.
[2746.77s -> 2752.90s]  Usually 250 to 300 is percent works when it's a red item.
[2752.90s -> 2755.34s]  Looks like I'm just going to sell them.
[2755.34s -> 2758.50s]  Accessories are down.
[2758.50s -> 2760.50s]  Get that shit out of here.
[2760.50s -> 2772.68s]  Out here.
[2772.68s -> 2776.68s]  I got somebody wanted scarves today, right?
[2776.68s -> 2780.01s]  Shoes out here.
[2780.01s -> 2785.64s]  I need to go on an adventure.
[2785.64s -> 2786.82s]  Yeah.
[2786.82s -> 2787.82s]  Let me fill that order.
[2787.82s -> 2789.82s]  Let me hold on.
[2789.82s -> 2795.34s]  Let's get some powerful antioxidants out here or whatever this is.
[2795.34s -> 2797.34s]  Keep the bat wings.
[2797.34s -> 2798.71s]  Bake DM up there.
[2798.71s -> 2799.71s]  No, no, no.
[2799.71s -> 2802.71s]  Get the bake DM and get the fish up there too.
[2802.71s -> 2811.52s]  Let's be like a, let's be a grocery store for a little while.
[2811.52s -> 2815.64s]  Sword out there.
[2815.64s -> 2816.64s]  Yeah.
[2816.64s -> 2817.64s]  Get the sword out there too.
[2817.64s -> 2822.46s]  Who gives a shit?
[2822.46s -> 2823.46s]  Who cares?
[2823.46s -> 2824.46s]  All right.
[2824.46s -> 2825.46s]  I'm going to go after this.
[2825.46s -> 2826.46s]  After today, I'm going to the dungeon.
[2826.46s -> 2837.65s]  I can do the new carpet now.
[2837.65s -> 2838.89s]  Let's go.
[2838.89s -> 2843.65s]  Can I help you?
[2843.65s -> 2845.65s]  I'd like to buy some food.
[2845.65s -> 2848.66s]  I got you.
[2848.66s -> 2849.66s]  I got you.
[2849.66s -> 2854.46s]  I got a bake DM right there.
[2854.46s -> 2855.46s]  2,600.
[2855.46s -> 2857.89s]  That's too expensive.
[2857.89s -> 2865.72s]  2,400.
[2865.72s -> 2867.72s]  Jerma's Grocery and Swords.
[2867.72s -> 2869.66s]  Yeah.
[2869.66s -> 2881.79s]  When she died, my grandmother told me to sell this if I ever got into trouble.
[2881.79s -> 2886.12s]  Oh, I just insulted your entire family.
[2886.12s -> 2890.12s]  Oh, I was looking for one of these.
[2890.12s -> 2891.12s]  Where are you now?
[2891.12s -> 2904.14s]  I think I can get away with like 200 and 200 percent, two or five.
[2904.14s -> 2906.14s]  He's broke, but I think it'll work.
[2906.14s -> 2909.34s]  75 maybe.
[2909.34s -> 2910.34s]  72.
[2910.34s -> 2911.34s]  No, 7,000.
[2911.34s -> 2914.37s]  Got it.
[2914.37s -> 2922.52s]  What can I get you?
[2922.52s -> 2928.18s]  Can I get you to buy this?
[2928.18s -> 2931.21s]  100 bucks.
[2931.21s -> 2933.21s]  Just scamming the elderly.
[2933.21s -> 2944.78s]  Here we go.
[2944.78s -> 2947.27s]  That price isn't right.
[2947.27s -> 2948.58s]  1,200.
[2948.58s -> 2949.58s]  Take it or leave it.
[2949.58s -> 2954.50s]  Give it to the Twix kids.
[2954.50s -> 2958.22s]  Oh, here we go.
[2958.22s -> 2961.54s]  It pains me to part with this.
[2961.54s -> 2964.23s]  It's just a piece of candy.
[2964.23s -> 2968.62s]  The price is wrong.
[2968.62s -> 2972.81s]  Ooh.

[3018.51s -> 3020.01s]  All right.
[3020.01s -> 3024.85s]  I need to go kill the slime like a bunch of times.
[3024.85s -> 3026.85s]  Two scarves, two food stuffs.
[3026.85s -> 3031.70s]  What else can I put out here?
[3031.70s -> 3033.70s]  I'm going to put the shark fin out here.

[3045.93s -> 3047.93s]  I'm not going to use them, am I?
[3047.93s -> 3053.73s]  I don't want to get rid of any of these materials unless it's for this.
[3053.73s -> 3057.08s]  You know what I mean?
[3057.08s -> 3073.82s]  I have a bunch of them, but I feel like I'm going to need them to be out there or whatever.

[3087.58s -> 3089.27s]  That's fine.
[3089.27s -> 3091.96s]  Looking is free.
[3091.96s -> 3094.96s]  You're all right, Reset.

[3166.35s -> 3168.68s]  It's all right.

[3169.68s -> 3170.68s]  You understand?
[3170.68s -> 3175.43s]  There are some actors and some voice over artists that you can not emulate.
[3175.43s -> 3176.43s]  They'll know.
[3176.43s -> 3178.43s]  They'll never be another one that can do that way.
[3178.43s -> 3187.26s]  You at least got to try to laugh.
[3198.66s -> 3207.14s]  You have to admit that there are some things that you can't do.
[3207.14s -> 3208.51s]  Right.
[3208.51s -> 3212.44s]  There are some things you just cannot do.

[3436.42s -> 3437.42s]  No support.
[3437.42s -> 3442.88s]  What?
[3442.88s -> 3445.88s]  Where was Benjamin Franklin on like the political alignment chart?
[3445.88s -> 3450.55s]  That's where I want to be.
[3450.55s -> 3465.66s]  He was a chaotic neutral.
[3465.66s -> 3479.35s]  Franklin was chaotic.
[3479.35s -> 3480.35s]  Good.
[3480.35s -> 3481.35s]  It's important.
[3481.35s -> 3486.75s]  Let me see this.
[3486.75s -> 3487.75s]  What's my alignment?

[3588.65s -> 3589.65s]  I'm a disciplined emotional.
[3589.65s -> 3590.65s]  That is what I am.
[3590.65s -> 3591.65s]  We've already that we came to the term determination of that long time ago.

[3675.70s -> 3678.92s]  Now don't move.
[3678.92s -> 3679.92s]  Just a couple of quick questions.
[3679.92s -> 3683.35s]  Where do you sit on the political alignment chart?
[3683.35s -> 3684.35s]  Well, I sit...
[3684.35s -> 3685.35s]  Oh.

[3686.35s -> 3687.35s]  Can I move yet?
[3687.35s -> 3688.35s]  Not yet.
[3688.35s -> 3694.65s]  Give me just a few more minutes.
[3694.65s -> 3695.65s]  OK.

[3712.58s -> 3713.58s]  OK.
[3713.58s -> 3714.58s]  Really?
[3714.58s -> 3715.58s]  Can I move yet?
[3715.58s -> 3722.32s]  Just a little bit more.
[3722.32s -> 3723.32s]  And...
[3723.32s -> 3725.52s]  Done.
[3725.52s -> 3726.52s]  Phew.
[3726.52s -> 3727.52s]  Being a model is hard.
[3727.52s -> 3729.52s]  My legs feel like tent poles.
[3729.52s -> 3730.52s]  So let's see it.
[3730.52s -> 3731.52s]  Come on.
[3731.52s -> 3732.52s]  Here you go.
[3732.52s -> 3736.13s]  This is me.

[3739.13s -> 3741.13s]  Oh, where am I in this picture?
[3741.13s -> 3744.39s]  Oh, you're right here, Ms. Fairy.
[3744.39s -> 3746.46s]  But that is...
[3746.46s -> 3748.46s]  Is that not a dragonfly?
[3748.46s -> 3750.79s]  Hee-hee.
[3750.79s -> 3751.79s]  You're really good.
[3751.79s -> 3752.79s]  Hee-hee-hee.
[3752.79s -> 3753.79s]  Hee-hee-hee.
[3753.79s -> 3755.10s]  That was an ee-hee.
[3755.10s -> 3757.27s]  I haven't seen that in a long time.
[3757.27s -> 3759.28s]  I really think...
[3759.28s -> 3760.28s]  I really like this.
[3760.28s -> 3761.52s]  Thank you.
[3761.52s -> 3762.52s]  Thanks, Mr. Reset.
[3762.52s -> 3763.89s]  Bye-bye.
[3763.89s -> 3769.75s]  Do I really look that much like a dragonfly?
[3769.75s -> 3770.75s]  Oh.
[3770.75s -> 3772.75s]  I can't believe it.
[3772.75s -> 3774.25s]  OK.
[3774.25s -> 3775.25s]  Let's go.
[3775.25s -> 3776.25s]  I want to buy some shit.
[3776.25s -> 3780.88s]  I need to sell this.
[3780.88s -> 3782.88s]  I have to start making money.
[3782.88s -> 3786.08s]  I'm going to buy parade armor.
[3786.08s -> 3791.78s]  And let's get the spiked armband.
[3791.78s -> 3795.70s]  Popular.
[3795.70s -> 3796.70s]  Let's get some charms.
[3796.70s -> 3797.70s]  No, no.
[3797.70s -> 3798.70s]  These things suck.
[3798.70s -> 3802.38s]  Composite bow.
[3802.38s -> 3805.09s]  Practice lands.
[3805.09s -> 3808.09s]  I need high-paying items.
[3808.09s -> 3826.86s]  I...
[3826.86s -> 3830.09s]  I can do that.
[3830.09s -> 3831.09s]  I need to get into that dungeon.
[3831.09s -> 3832.71s]  All right.
[3832.71s -> 3834.71s]  No matter what, tomorrow I'm getting a dungeon.
[3834.71s -> 3839.17s]  Let's get these products up here.
[3839.17s -> 3841.17s]  I need to make money.
[3841.17s -> 3842.17s]  Forty-two hundred.
[3842.17s -> 3843.17s]  That's worth so much.
[3843.17s -> 3845.17s]  I just have to keep doing that.
[3845.17s -> 3850.03s]  Foodstuff is today.
[3850.03s -> 3851.03s]  All right.
[3851.03s -> 3852.03s]  All right.
[3852.03s -> 3853.03s]  OK.
[3853.03s -> 3854.03s]  All right.
[3854.03s -> 3860.97s]  Open the damn store.
[3860.97s -> 3863.34s]  And came by to sell this.
[3863.34s -> 3867.02s]  There's something I've noticed about the citizens in this game.
[3867.02s -> 3874.71s]  All they have, they just come in with random food they find in their house on the ground.
[3874.71s -> 3877.95s]  Nobody ever comes in here with a necklace that's worth any money.
[3877.95s -> 3881.95s]  They just come in with fucking yams and apples and bread.
[3881.95s -> 3885.09s]  I would be more inclined to be happy about this if they was...
[3885.09s -> 3886.09s]  Hey, I found this.
[3886.09s -> 3889.09s]  Oh, I was in my grandmother's closet today.
[3889.09s -> 3893.09s]  And after she died and we found some parade armor.
[3893.09s -> 3895.03s]  I would buy that.
[3895.03s -> 3898.03s]  I'd be happy to do a decent price.
[3898.03s -> 3900.81s]  OK.
[3900.81s -> 3901.81s]  Well, that's a...
[3901.81s -> 3906.08s]  Let's do forty-seven hundred.
[3906.08s -> 3907.08s]  These guys just...
[3907.08s -> 3910.08s]  I'm having a collection of expensive items.
[3910.08s -> 3917.42s]  I do have the foodstuff that you asked for.
[3917.42s -> 3921.10s]  Just stay right there, sir.
[3921.10s -> 3923.86s]  I got baked E.M.
[3923.86s -> 3925.86s]  And...
[3925.86s -> 3926.86s]  Fish.
[3926.86s -> 3934.15s]  Let's do one twenty.
[3934.15s -> 3943.20s]  Thank you.
[3943.20s -> 3944.20s]  Somebody buy the parade armor.
[3944.20s -> 3946.20s]  Oh, here comes the rich girl.
[3946.20s -> 3949.02s]  Oh, the scarves, right.
[3949.02s -> 3954.05s]  Three thousand and fifty.
[3954.05s -> 3959.94s]  Overcharge.
[3959.94s -> 3962.24s]  Let's do one forty...
[3962.24s -> 3963.24s]  Forty-five hundred?
[3963.24s -> 3965.24s]  That's a hundred and forty-seven percent.
[3965.24s -> 3971.18s]  Forty-six?
[3971.18s -> 3973.18s]  Do two hundred percent.
[3973.18s -> 3974.18s]  Really?
[3974.18s -> 3975.18s]  I don't know if that's gonna happen.
[3975.18s -> 3978.70s]  That's ridiculous.
[3978.70s -> 3979.70s]  She's not...
[3979.70s -> 3980.70s]  She's gonna walk out.
[3980.70s -> 3991.82s]  I'm gonna say forty-six hundred.
[3991.82s -> 3992.82s]  She didn't like that.
[3992.82s -> 3994.82s]  She hated that, by the way.
[3994.82s -> 3996.82s]  You guys want me to start at two hundred percent?
[3996.82s -> 3998.82s]  She hated that.
[3998.82s -> 4000.82s]  I have to do like forty-two hundred now.
[4000.82s -> 4007.98s]  I have to sell it.
[4007.98s -> 4014.83s]  I'm up against the clock.
[4014.83s -> 4015.83s]  Somebody buy the parade armor.
[4015.83s -> 4018.78s]  I'd like some food.
[4018.78s -> 4030.83s]  Fuck.
[4030.83s -> 4034.86s]  Oh, come on, man.
[4034.86s -> 4036.86s]  Did you spend all your money?
[4036.86s -> 4038.86s]  What did you spend your money on?
[4038.86s -> 4048.68s]  Somebody buy the parade armor.
[4048.68s -> 4052.30s]  Help a poor lost Burke find a weapon.
[4052.30s -> 4053.30s]  I can do that.
[4053.30s -> 4056.74s]  And it's gonna be really expensive.
[4056.74s -> 4074.23s]  Ah!
[4074.23s -> 4093.29s]  Fuck you!
[4093.29s -> 4094.29s]  That wasn't even fucking...
[4094.29s -> 4095.29s]  Come on!
[4095.29s -> 4099.41s]  Are you serious?
[4099.41s -> 4105.13s]  That was so...
[4105.13s -> 4108.13s]  That was reasonable for a high-demand item.
[4108.13s -> 4121.89s]  Curse at your customers?
[4121.89s -> 4123.13s]  Why not?
[4123.13s -> 4130.94s]  I'm up against the clock again.
[4130.94s -> 4132.94s]  It's happening again.
[4132.94s -> 4146.66s]  Let's go to the pub.
[4146.66s -> 4152.29s]  Oh, charm hello again.
[4152.29s -> 4153.29s]  Here we go again.
[4153.29s -> 4154.29s]  Oh, hello.
[4154.29s -> 4156.29s]  Hello, receipt.
[4159.19s -> 4161.62s]  Tears here, too.
[4161.62s -> 4164.62s]  Well, you have my deepest apologies for my continued existence.
[4164.62s -> 4168.62s]  Oh, I can't take receipt home with me if you're here.
[4168.62s -> 4173.83s]  What?
[4185.95s -> 4187.95s]  I cannot let you do anything of that.
[4187.95s -> 4188.95s]  So I'm kidding.
[4188.95s -> 4189.95s]  Yeesh.
[4189.95s -> 4191.95s]  Guys, this is serious.
[4191.95s -> 4193.95s]  Somebody call the police.
[4193.95s -> 4204.69s]  Especially when you...
[4205.69s -> 4209.21s]  I kind of wish I didn't go into the fucking pub
[4209.21s -> 4211.21s]  because with that, I don't...
[4211.21s -> 4223.33s]  Okay.
[4223.33s -> 4227.32s]  Well, first of all, let's go back to the store.
[4227.32s -> 4234.42s]  I'm just gonna sell what I have
[4234.42s -> 4235.42s]  and hopefully somebody buys it.
[4235.42s -> 4237.42s]  And then tomorrow we go...
[4238.42s -> 4239.98s]  to you-know-where.
[4239.98s -> 4244.23s]  Murph!
[4244.23s -> 4246.92s]  Oh, shit.
[4246.92s -> 4249.29s]  Have you completed my order yet?
[4249.29s -> 4251.59s]  Well, no, no, I don't have it.
[4251.59s -> 4253.59s]  I don't have it, I don't have it, I don't have it.
[4253.59s -> 4256.56s]  Well, nothing for it.
[4256.56s -> 4259.56s]  And to be fair, some of those items are a bear.
[4259.56s -> 4262.56s]  The slime livers from normal slimes are too small for starters.
[4262.56s -> 4265.56s]  I need something from one that's bigger.
[4265.56s -> 4268.56s]  Batwing shouldn't be too hard if you've hunt the eyeball bats, though.
[4268.56s -> 4272.56s]  I've also heard that it knows a giant meister found of charred lizards.
[4272.56s -> 4274.56s]  All right, I did this already.
[4274.56s -> 4275.56s]  Get out of here.
[4276.93s -> 4278.36s]  There it is.
[4278.36s -> 4280.11s]  There it is.
[4280.11s -> 4282.11s]  All right, here we go.
[4282.11s -> 4284.95s]  I'm gonna say...
[4284.95s -> 4285.95s]  Let's do 68.
[4290.33s -> 4293.14s]  65, come on.
[4293.14s -> 4295.14s]  All right, 62.
[4295.14s -> 4305.79s]  And then there's a bow.
[4306.79s -> 4309.82s]  35.
[4309.82s -> 4310.82s]  A bow.
[4312.13s -> 4316.50s]  I need a hundred and fucking 30,000 more dollars.
[4316.50s -> 4318.50s]  I gotta get into that new dungeon.
[4322.68s -> 4323.68s]  No, I don't...
[4323.68s -> 4328.70s]  I guess a 24.
[4329.94s -> 4330.94s]  25.
[4330.94s -> 4337.78s]  The dungeon's gonna save me, isn't it?
[4337.78s -> 4343.12s]  Hey.
[4343.12s -> 4344.12s]  Hey, it's me again.
[4344.12s -> 4349.12s]  I decided to come by and sell you another yam that I come by and try to sell you every day.
[4349.12s -> 4377.94s]  Candy apples.
[4378.94s -> 4379.94s]  I love candy apples.
[4379.94s -> 4381.94s]  All right, time for the dungeon.
[4386.26s -> 4388.26s]  That's $17,000 a day.
[4391.56s -> 4392.56s]  All right, here we go.
[4392.56s -> 4395.56s]  The price of metal items has increased.
[4395.56s -> 4398.56s]  The price of daggers has normalized.
[4398.56s -> 4403.10s]  Do I have anything like that?
[4403.10s -> 4404.92s]  No.
[4404.92s -> 4405.92s]  All right.
[4405.92s -> 4406.92s]  Let's...
[4406.92s -> 4407.92s]  I need to go into the new dungeon.
[4407.92s -> 4408.92s]  We gotta get some new stuff.
[4408.92s -> 4417.47s]  So by tomorrow, I need two food stuffs.
[4417.47s -> 4419.10s]  I gotta...
[4419.10s -> 4420.10s]  Fuck.
[4420.10s -> 4434.67s]  I need a big item.
[4434.67s -> 4436.67s]  All right, we got a level eight.
[4436.67s -> 4439.91s]  I'm gonna stay with tried and true here.
[4439.91s -> 4440.91s]  We're going with Louis.
[4440.91s -> 4447.95s]  Let's get a couple of pieces of bread.
[4447.95s -> 4455.91s]  This is uncharted territory here.
[4455.91s -> 4456.91s]  Here we go.
[4456.91s -> 4457.91s]  Amber Garden.
[4457.91s -> 4461.65s]  You want...
[4461.65s -> 4462.65s]  We demand charm.
[4462.65s -> 4465.65s]  Not when I need $140,000.
[4465.65s -> 4471.15s]  Take charm.
[4471.15s -> 4472.65s]  I need...
[4472.65s -> 4473.65s]  She's level eight.
[4473.65s -> 4475.65s]  She's got a rusty dagger.
[4475.65s -> 4487.87s]  Buy a better one.
[4487.87s -> 4495.64s]  No.
[4495.64s -> 4496.64s]  Will she use...
[4496.64s -> 4499.26s]  This is gonna be a mistake, ain't it?
[4499.26s -> 4504.65s]  No.
[4504.65s -> 4505.65s]  I'm sorry, guys.
[4505.65s -> 4514.82s]  I'm taking Louis.
[4514.82s -> 4519.78s]  No.
[4519.78s -> 4525.78s]  I will take charm when it's not absolutely necessary that I have to clear this.
[4525.78s -> 4526.78s]  I don't...
[4526.78s -> 4533.42s]  I don't even know what...
[4533.42s -> 4534.42s]  Okay, I need these guys.
[4534.42s -> 4539.73s]  By the way, she said, are you okay?
[4539.73s -> 4554.82s]  I can speak Japanese.
[4554.82s -> 4557.99s]  You learned that yesterday.
[4557.99s -> 4558.99s]  So?
[4558.99s -> 4569.53s]  If I learned a language yesterday, would that be a problem?
[4569.53s -> 4570.90s]  What is that?
[4570.90s -> 4573.84s]  That's like a new enemy.
[4573.84s -> 4575.21s]  Ow.
[4575.21s -> 4576.21s]  Ooh, hat.
[4576.21s -> 4580.26s]  It's a cloth hat.
[4580.26s -> 4581.26s]  Come on.
[4581.26s -> 4589.94s]  Oh, some kind of new enemy.
[4589.94s -> 4590.94s]  Ow.
[4590.94s -> 4596.74s]  Fun fact, the items in the dungeon suck.
[4596.74s -> 4602.56s]  But I need to get the materials to be able to make cool items.
[4602.56s -> 4603.56s]  These guys are supposed to drop them.
[4603.56s -> 4611.71s]  Those are the gnolls, right?
[4611.71s -> 4627.98s]  Nothing over there?
[4627.98s -> 4629.98s]  Same old enemies in new dungeon.
[4629.98s -> 4635.54s]  B, W, L.
[4635.54s -> 4636.54s]  Shit.
[4636.54s -> 4640.30s]  Are you alright?
[4640.30s -> 4643.06s]  What does that mean?
[4643.06s -> 4645.06s]  That means, are you...
[4645.06s -> 4647.06s]  Are you good?
[4647.06s -> 4648.06s]  Is are you alright?
[4648.06s -> 4649.06s]  And then she goes, are you good?
[4649.06s -> 4654.71s]  Are you hurt?
[4654.71s -> 4655.71s]  Nice battling.
[4655.71s -> 4663.56s]  I think I have as many of those as I need.
[4663.56s -> 4668.64s]  Wait.
[4668.64s -> 4669.64s]  Say W again.
[4669.64s -> 4671.14s]  That's really nice.
[4671.14s -> 4676.47s]  W.
[4676.47s -> 4681.90s]  Watch out for the hand.
[4681.90s -> 4684.90s]  Ooh, what's that, gunpowder?
[4684.90s -> 4689.86s]  I probably can use that in something.
[4689.86s -> 4690.86s]  New item.
[4690.86s -> 4701.62s]  Is the next room going to be in JST instead of PST?
[4701.62s -> 4706.18s]  Oh, is that supposed to be Japanese Standard Time?
[4706.18s -> 4709.00s]  Is that what it's actually called?
[4709.00s -> 4713.39s]  It's not Japanese Standard Time, is it?
[4713.39s -> 4730.10s]  Movement speed increased for everyone.
[4730.10s -> 4732.42s]  What?
[4732.42s -> 4736.37s]  I actually, can I keep this on permanently?
[4736.37s -> 4740.70s]  Hey, I want this on forever.
[4740.70s -> 4741.70s]  That's not a detriment to what I'm doing.
[4741.70s -> 4747.30s]  That's a positive.
[4747.30s -> 4757.34s]  I definitely have five bad ones.
[4757.34s -> 4765.20s]  Mystery item.
[4765.20s -> 4767.20s]  Come here.
[4767.20s -> 4771.28s]  No, I'm not alright.
[4771.28s -> 4782.46s]  I just had a bomb explode in my face.
[4782.46s -> 4786.42s]  These, they drop the bread.
[4786.42s -> 4787.42s]  I don't even want it.
[4787.42s -> 4792.42s]  Yeah, I'm just going to eat it right now.
[4792.42s -> 4793.42s]  Say, what's that one?
[4793.42s -> 4795.42s]  Daijou B.
[4795.42s -> 4796.42s]  What's B?
[4796.42s -> 4799.56s]  Are you alright?
[4799.56s -> 4812.06s]  Ooh, an apple.
[4812.06s -> 4815.43s]  First time I've seen that.
[4815.43s -> 4818.66s]  It's an accent.
[4818.66s -> 4820.66s]  Oh, okay.
[4820.66s -> 4821.66s]  Hey, that's good to know.
[4821.66s -> 4826.46s]  Alright, cool.
[4826.46s -> 4834.67s]  Hitchy eye, hold on.
[4834.67s -> 4840.35s]  Shit.
[4840.35s -> 4843.87s]  Toothpicks?
[4843.87s -> 4849.08s]  What the fuck am I going to do with these?
[4849.08s -> 4859.81s]  One last spot I didn't see down here.
[4859.81s -> 4862.30s]  Something good.
[4862.30s -> 4863.30s]  That's wood.
[4863.30s -> 4867.82s]  That's wood.
[4867.82s -> 4869.82s]  Get those George Washington teeth out of here.
[4869.82s -> 4875.94s]  I don't even want them.
[4875.94s -> 4886.85s]  What are we on?
[4886.85s -> 4892.06s]  Second floor Amber Garden?
[4892.06s -> 4897.18s]  We could just skip to the latino.
[4897.18s -> 4904.71s]  And then I have to do the slime thing.
[4904.71s -> 4906.71s]  Is that going to waste so much time?
[4906.71s -> 4908.71s]  I can't even get that guy's order.
[4908.71s -> 4910.71s]  It's going to be so...
[4910.71s -> 4925.56s]  It's going to take forever.
[4925.56s -> 4931.45s]  Forget about the slime liver.
[4931.45s -> 4937.10s]  Like, I need it though.
[4937.10s -> 4938.10s]  I'm going to do some fusion.
[4938.10s -> 4939.10s]  I'm going to do some fusion.
[4939.10s -> 4942.85s]  I'm going to make some money.
[4942.85s -> 4944.09s]  How much?
[4944.09s -> 4945.09s]  I have 70,000.
[4945.09s -> 4947.46s]  I need 200.
[4947.46s -> 4953.40s]  I don't think it will take too long.
[4953.40s -> 4962.74s]  Let's get rid of the bread.
[4962.74s -> 4963.74s]  Bread is worthless.
[4963.74s -> 4965.24s]  Alright, here we go.
[4965.24s -> 4969.50s]  Did these guys drop new stuff?
[4969.50s -> 4970.50s]  Gunpowder.
[4970.50s -> 4971.81s]  Dammit.
[4971.81s -> 4982.86s]  I don't think the null has dropped.
[4982.86s -> 4985.86s]  One of the items that I need from the null.
[4985.86s -> 4988.86s]  Has it?
[4988.86s -> 4999.05s]  All they drop is chestnuts.
[4999.05s -> 5006.20s]  Magical Staff?
[5006.20s -> 5007.20s]  It's the charred lizard.
[5007.20s -> 5008.20s]  I only have one.
[5008.20s -> 5017.06s]  Watch out.
[5017.06s -> 5029.77s]  He's going to explode.
[5029.77s -> 5033.76s]  Don't blow up.
[5033.76s -> 5034.76s]  Don't blow up.
[5034.76s -> 5045.17s]  These levels are bigger.
[5045.17s -> 5046.17s]  One chain.
[5046.17s -> 5052.17s]  So, somebody was saying, if I kill the same enemy in a row, just ignore everything else
[5052.17s -> 5055.17s]  and just kill the enemy that I need to kill, there's a higher chance that it will drop
[5055.17s -> 5057.98s]  the thing that I want it to drop?
[5057.98s -> 5060.98s]  So, just run around and only kill the nulls.
[5060.98s -> 5062.98s]  Well, except.
[5062.98s -> 5063.98s]  Apparently.
[5063.98s -> 5064.98s]  So it seems.
[5064.98s -> 5065.98s]  Huh.
[5065.98s -> 5071.26s]  Alright.
[5071.26s -> 5077.36s]  News.
[5077.36s -> 5079.36s]  Adventurer attack power doubled.
[5079.36s -> 5084.65s]  Well, that's pretty convenient.
[5084.65s -> 5089.00s]  Maybe I shouldn't leave.
[5089.00s -> 5090.00s]  What's that?
[5090.00s -> 5091.00s]  Rusty?
[5091.00s -> 5092.00s]  Okay.
[5092.00s -> 5093.62s]  Inkwell.
[5093.62s -> 5098.62s]  That's a part of a recipe.
[5098.62s -> 5102.57s]  Don't ever leave.
[5102.57s -> 5103.57s]  Yeah.
[5103.57s -> 5106.81s]  I'm just going to keep going down.
[5106.81s -> 5115.68s]  Why would I leave?
[5115.68s -> 5118.56s]  That felt pretty good.
[5118.56s -> 5119.56s]  Watch this.
[5119.56s -> 5120.56s]  Ready?
[5120.56s -> 5121.99s]  Three, four.
[5121.99s -> 5124.77s]  Two chain.
[5124.77s -> 5130.53s]  I can see the shadows.
[5130.53s -> 5131.53s]  Ow.
[5131.53s -> 5132.90s]  No.
[5132.90s -> 5133.90s]  Don't.
[5133.90s -> 5134.90s]  Come on.
[5134.90s -> 5135.90s]  What's that?
[5135.90s -> 5136.90s]  A jacket?
[5136.90s -> 5137.90s]  I love a windbreaker.
[5137.90s -> 5141.33s]  The windbreaker is stupid.
[5141.33s -> 5142.33s]  Everything's stupid.
[5142.33s -> 5143.33s]  You're stupid.
[5143.33s -> 5145.40s]  I'm not stupid.
[5145.40s -> 5146.40s]  This is level 18.
[5146.40s -> 5156.66s]  Ah.
[5156.66s -> 5157.66s]  Honey.
[5157.66s -> 5162.25s]  I think I need three honeys, right?
[5162.25s -> 5182.44s]  This is where it gets fucked up.
[5182.44s -> 5183.44s]  Alright.
[5183.44s -> 5184.44s]  I need three honeys.
[5184.44s -> 5190.61s]  Let's eat the cherry.
[5190.61s -> 5194.23s]  I'm almost going to have enough to make a bunch of stuff.
[5194.23s -> 5196.82s]  Snow.
[5196.82s -> 5198.50s]  Come on.
[5198.50s -> 5208.14s]  This is the cherry, but I need a big of bags.
[5208.14s -> 5222.02s]  I can just get rid of the bread.
[5222.02s -> 5226.02s]  I'm at that point where I have to start eliminating the least expensive thing here.
[5226.02s -> 5232.72s]  God damn it.
[5232.72s -> 5234.72s]  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
[5234.72s -> 5235.72s]  It's a bad thing.
[5235.72s -> 5242.50s]  Does the candy restore its SP?
[5242.50s -> 5260.14s]  I'm curious to see how close I am to two or three cubes.
[5260.14s -> 5263.14s]  I'm going to miss this double damage when it's gone on the next floor.
[5263.14s -> 5266.38s]  It even does lead.
[5266.38s -> 5273.92s]  Can I dash by double tapping?
[5273.92s -> 5274.92s]  No.
[5274.92s -> 5280.25s]  You're on a fixed speed.
[5280.25s -> 5281.87s]  Chest.
[5281.87s -> 5282.87s]  Whoa.
[5282.87s -> 5283.87s]  Gunpowder.
[5283.87s -> 5284.87s]  Good.
[5284.87s -> 5289.69s]  Can you make a gun or explosives or something?
[5289.69s -> 5299.06s]  I'm almost level 19, so I'm going to get, mm, 1200.
[5299.06s -> 5300.06s]  That's pretty good.
[5300.06s -> 5303.49s]  This thing's a piece of crap, but I can sell it for something stupid.
[5303.49s -> 5304.49s]  How much is the windbreaker?
[5304.49s -> 5305.49s]  500.
[5305.49s -> 5312.62s]  Let's get rid of the chest nut.
[5312.62s -> 5318.66s]  What is this game?
[5318.66s -> 5328.32s]  This is called Risseteer and Item Shops Tale.
[5328.32s -> 5330.32s]  I could be saying that wrong.
[5330.32s -> 5335.32s]  I've probably been risk pronouncing this the whole entire game, so it wouldn't surprise me.
[5335.32s -> 5339.03s]  Is it on sale for $5?
[5339.03s -> 5341.46s]  I'll go get it.
[5341.46s -> 5342.46s]  This is what, is it $4.99?
[5342.46s -> 5343.46s]  Just go buy it.
[5343.46s -> 5352.14s]  Why would you not?
[5352.14s -> 5362.70s]  I mean, you have to gauge.
[5362.70s -> 5363.70s]  All right.
[5363.70s -> 5364.70s]  What is the boss?
[5364.70s -> 5368.70s]  Sometimes you have to gauge the value of something based on if it's more money for you to go
[5368.70s -> 5371.70s]  get like a double cheeseburger from McDonald's.
[5371.70s -> 5372.70s]  Oh, shit.
[5372.70s -> 5380.19s]  This guy's kind of.
[5380.19s -> 5382.84s]  Uh-oh.
[5382.84s -> 5383.84s]  Uh-oh.
[5383.84s -> 5385.59s]  Oh, shit.
[5385.59s -> 5407.67s]  I got to eat food and eat the apple.
[5407.67s -> 5412.38s]  Don't do it.
[5412.38s -> 5416.31s]  Shit.
[5416.31s -> 5417.31s]  Shit.
[5417.31s -> 5418.68s]  Shit.
[5418.68s -> 5419.68s]  Do I know what can't?
[5419.68s -> 5420.68s]  All right.
[5420.68s -> 5433.82s]  Calm down.
[5433.82s -> 5437.75s]  Shit.
[5437.75s -> 5438.75s]  Oh, God.
[5438.75s -> 5439.75s]  Oh, God.
[5439.75s -> 5440.75s]  Oh, God.
[5440.75s -> 5454.47s]  Oh, God.
[5454.47s -> 5459.42s]  Oh, God.
[5459.42s -> 5460.42s]  Oh, my God.
[5460.42s -> 5466.59s]  Oh, my God.
[5466.59s -> 5467.59s]  Oh, my God.
[5467.59s -> 5468.59s]  Oh, my God.
[5468.59s -> 5471.56s]  Oh, my God.
[5471.56s -> 5472.56s]  Oh, my God.
[5472.56s -> 5473.56s]  Oh, my God.
[5473.56s -> 5474.56s]  I freaked out.
[5474.56s -> 5475.56s]  No chest or anything.
[5475.56s -> 5476.74s]  Should I just keep going?
[5476.74s -> 5477.74s]  No.
[5477.74s -> 5483.90s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[5483.90s -> 5484.90s]  I'm not going.
[5484.90s -> 5485.90s]  I can't.
[5485.90s -> 5486.90s]  I have to sell stuff.
[5486.90s -> 5489.55s]  I need money.
[5489.55s -> 5490.55s]  I'm not going.
[5492.18s -> 5493.61s]  Fusions.
[5493.61s -> 5495.21s]  Rank one staff.
[5495.21s -> 5497.89s]  I need a back scratcher.
[5497.89s -> 5498.89s]  Where the hell can I get a back scratcher?
[5498.89s -> 5499.89s]  Didn't I have one?
[5499.89s -> 5507.98s]  Hat?
[5507.98s -> 5510.18s]  I need some.
[5510.18s -> 5512.50s]  Okay.
[5512.50s -> 5513.50s]  Can I craft a back?
[5513.50s -> 5514.50s]  Okay.
[5514.50s -> 5515.50s]  I can make one.
[5515.50s -> 5519.62s]  I can make another one of these.
[5519.62s -> 5523.17s]  Toothpicks.
[5523.17s -> 5525.66s]  This is like $15,000 to $16,000.
[5525.66s -> 5531.90s]  So, but I can't because I need to give that to the dude.
[5531.90s -> 5535.83s]  All right.
[5535.83s -> 5537.03s]  So, I need fur balls.
[5537.03s -> 5538.03s]  I can get the...
[5538.03s -> 5539.03s]  So, can I...
[5539.03s -> 5541.78s]  Can I buy a back scratcher?
[5541.82s -> 5546.78s]  This is probably going to be worth a lot of money.
[5546.78s -> 5547.78s]  Back scratcher.
[5547.78s -> 5557.82s]  Where am I going to get a back scratcher?
[5557.82s -> 5571.86s]  Well, there's the...
[5571.86s -> 5574.86s]  Yeah, I can get this, but I still need the fur.
[5574.86s -> 5579.68s]  So, I can go back and go get like the fur from the first few floors.
[5579.68s -> 5583.26s]  Floors 11 to 15?
[5583.26s -> 5585.85s]  Yeah.
[5585.85s -> 5595.02s]  So, let me get this.
[5595.02s -> 5602.02s]  I need a back scratcher and I need three fur balls.
[5602.02s -> 5608.44s]  All right.
[5608.44s -> 5617.74s]  I can't do this today, but might as well just do this event because it's flashing.
[5617.78s -> 5620.49s]  Fur balls are easy.
[5620.49s -> 5624.03s]  Yeah.
[5624.03s -> 5628.03s]  I heard there's a girl here who's been handing out advice to people lately.
[5628.03s -> 5629.03s]  Advice?
[5629.03s -> 5632.03s]  Well, that would not be very surprising for a fortune teller as such, but here in the
[5632.03s -> 5636.03s]  pub, apparently she can clear up any problem you have in seconds.
[5636.03s -> 5637.03s]  Kind of wonder who it is.
[5637.03s -> 5639.62s]  Oh, it's me.
[5639.62s -> 5640.62s]  Haha.
[5640.62s -> 5641.62s]  I wish I got...
[5641.62s -> 5642.62s]  I wish I got...
[5642.62s -> 5643.62s]  Why this...
[5643.62s -> 5644.62s]  It was happening.
[5644.62s -> 5646.37s]  All right.
[5646.37s -> 5647.37s]  All right.
[5647.37s -> 5651.37s]  Slow down World of Warcraft filter when you take three drinks.
[5651.37s -> 5654.40s]  Oh, excuse me.
[5654.40s -> 5655.40s]  Yeah.
[5655.44s -> 5656.44s]  You have to be...
[5656.44s -> 5658.26s]  Will you hear me out?
[5658.26s -> 5659.26s]  Oh, yes.
[5659.26s -> 5660.26s]  I'll listen.
[5660.26s -> 5662.39s]  Go ahead.
[5662.39s -> 5665.43s]  My wife terrifies me so much at this point that I can't even look at alcohol without
[5665.43s -> 5666.43s]  feeling guilty.
[5666.43s -> 5667.99s]  Help.
[5667.99s -> 5668.99s]  Ah, women are easy to handle.
[5668.99s -> 5671.62s]  I should know, right?
[5671.62s -> 5673.82s]  Just do little things that keep her happy.
[5673.82s -> 5674.82s]  They'll solve your problems.
[5674.82s -> 5675.82s]  Yeah.
[5675.82s -> 5676.82s]  Aha.
[5676.82s -> 5677.82s]  Oh, that makes sense.
[5677.82s -> 5678.82s]  I'll try that out.
[5678.82s -> 5682.04s]  Thanks.
[5682.04s -> 5683.04s]  I mean, a lot of people like that lately.
[5683.04s -> 5684.04s]  Wonder why.
[5684.04s -> 5689.61s]  I didn't lose a slice for that one.
[5689.61s -> 5692.26s]  Did I?
[5692.26s -> 5693.26s]  All right.
[5693.26s -> 5694.26s]  What do I got?
[5694.54s -> 5695.54s]  One fucking 30,000.
[5695.54s -> 5710.12s]  I feel like I still have a lot of stuff on sale.
[5710.12s -> 5714.37s]  Didn't I?
[5714.37s -> 5715.37s]  No.
[5715.37s -> 5719.17s]  Somebody already bought this.
[5719.17s -> 5720.17s]  All right.
[5720.17s -> 5724.86s]  Let's do it.
[5724.86s -> 5727.38s]  Get the sword up there.
[5727.38s -> 5728.38s]  Let's get...
[5728.38s -> 5732.12s]  Oh, I need all this.
[5732.12s -> 5733.12s]  I gotta...
[5733.12s -> 5735.34s]  I have to start to sell these rings.
[5735.34s -> 5738.66s]  The same shit happened last time.
[5738.66s -> 5739.98s]  I have to sell them.
[5739.98s -> 5760.58s]  Oh, I am in a lot of trouble.
[5760.58s -> 5761.58s]  I'm not going to save over that.
[5761.58s -> 5762.58s]  I'm saving down here.
[5762.58s -> 5766.86s]  Just in case there's a disaster.
[5766.90s -> 5769.78s]  I'm gonna...
[5769.78s -> 5771.02s]  I gotta put them out.
[5771.02s -> 5789.58s]  I have to make some money here.
[5789.58s -> 5790.58s]  Don't sell the rings.
[5790.58s -> 5791.95s]  They're not...
[5791.95s -> 5795.08s]  No, they're not half price.
[5795.08s -> 5796.08s]  Sell the honey?
[5796.08s -> 5798.45s]  No, I need the honey for a fusion.
[5798.45s -> 5801.61s]  And then I gotta go back and get fur and then I gotta get a back scratcher.
[5801.61s -> 5805.60s]  They're not...
[5805.60s -> 5806.60s]  The half price.
[5806.60s -> 5812.66s]  Yeah, but I got them for like 5,000.
[5812.66s -> 5813.66s]  I can only really afford this.
[5813.66s -> 5824.96s]  I can afford to do this for like one more day.
[5824.96s -> 5828.46s]  I need the batlings for the fusion.
[5828.50s -> 5830.50s]  I could put like anti-venom out here.
[5830.50s -> 5836.42s]  You have to hold and have faith.
[5836.42s -> 5838.98s]  Toothpicks of worth, nothing, gunpowder is part of...
[5838.98s -> 5839.98s]  No, I can't.
[5839.98s -> 5840.98s]  Who's coming in today?
[5840.98s -> 5844.06s]  Anybody coming in at the end of the day?
[5844.06s -> 5845.54s]  Tomorrow, two food steps.
[5845.54s -> 5855.30s]  Okay.
[5855.30s -> 5856.30s]  No, I need all this shit.
[5856.30s -> 5863.30s]  I can put the armband up here.
[5863.30s -> 5865.57s]  Buy more rings?
[5865.57s -> 5867.37s]  Do not give me ideas like that.
[5867.37s -> 5888.06s]  There's a lot of good memories tied to this.
[5888.06s -> 5891.74s]  Is there a way I can put like a sign on the door that says, I don't want your stuff?
[5895.38s -> 5899.64s]  There's a lot of good memories tied to this cherry.
[5899.64s -> 5900.64s]  Okay, so...
[5900.64s -> 5913.50s]  This sells for 400.
[5913.50s -> 5918.30s]  When she died, my grandmother told me to sell this if I ever got into trouble.
[5918.30s -> 5930.26s]  I'm sorry.
[5930.26s -> 5931.70s]  Now I actually am getting scammed.
[5931.70s -> 5936.18s]  There we go.
[5936.18s -> 5938.70s]  140.
[5938.70s -> 5940.90s]  It is that much.
[5940.90s -> 5948.70s]  Once I get these diffusions, I'll have a ton of money.
[5948.70s -> 5951.71s]  All right, I want the windbreaker.
[5951.71s -> 5953.72s]  120.
[5953.72s -> 5962.00s]  I just need the right fusion.
[5962.78s -> 5964.58s]  I really, really need two hats.
[5964.58s -> 5965.58s]  I need them in two days.
[5965.58s -> 5971.14s]  I can do that.
[5971.14s -> 5972.14s]  Accept defeat.
[5972.14s -> 5974.47s]  No, I'm not going to accept defeat.
[5974.47s -> 5978.59s]  I have two or three fusions and those items are going to be worth like 20 to 30 thousand
[5978.59s -> 5981.35s]  dollars each.
[5981.35s -> 5982.35s]  I'm not going to...
[5982.35s -> 5987.26s]  I'll be fine.
[5987.26s -> 5989.06s]  The chilly season is here.
[5989.06s -> 5992.42s]  Those sensitive to cold should bundle up.
[5992.42s -> 5994.90s]  The price of accessories has normalized.
[5994.90s -> 5996.50s]  All right.
[5996.50s -> 6000.36s]  You know what that means, right?
[6000.40s -> 6002.56s]  That means it's time to sell the...
[6002.56s -> 6004.68s]  See, they were 50% off.
[6004.68s -> 6017.38s]  Let's get that bracelet up here.
[6017.38s -> 6021.76s]  All right.
[6021.76s -> 6030.33s]  Let's get some of these necklaces.
[6030.33s -> 6032.13s]  Make the fusion cape with the inkwell.
[6032.13s -> 6036.09s]  Well, if I do that, then I lose out on this dude's order.
[6036.09s -> 6038.53s]  But all right, I have to adventure.
[6038.53s -> 6040.49s]  Let me see exactly what I need.
[6040.49s -> 6053.44s]  There.
[6053.44s -> 6057.80s]  Just the good shit.
[6057.80s -> 6061.62s]  So I need to do...
[6061.62s -> 6064.22s]  I could just open the store now or should I go...
[6064.22s -> 6065.22s]  Let me see.
[6065.22s -> 6067.06s]  If I lose a slice of time.
[6067.06s -> 6071.02s]  How many days do I have?
[6071.02s -> 6075.57s]  It's like three days.
[6075.57s -> 6076.57s]  I'm going to lose.
[6076.57s -> 6089.26s]  I'm going to lose.
[6089.26s -> 6090.26s]  It's you again.
[6090.26s -> 6091.34s]  I don't have your order.
[6091.34s -> 6096.02s]  I'm sorry.
[6096.02s -> 6099.74s]  Bingo.
[6099.74s -> 6103.58s]  I'm going 3,400.
[6103.58s -> 6105.14s]  Just a little bit less.
[6105.14s -> 6106.46s]  3,300.
[6106.46s -> 6113.08s]  Take it.
[6113.08s -> 6114.08s]  Treasures.
[6114.08s -> 6115.08s]  Buy them.
[6115.08s -> 6116.08s]  Don't want...
[6116.08s -> 6120.65s]  I hope you don't want something in the window.
[6120.65s -> 6121.65s]  Go away.
[6121.73s -> 6140.56s]  I don't want to buy anymore stuff from you.
[6140.56s -> 6141.56s]  Please.
[6141.56s -> 6142.56s]  It's 600.
[6142.56s -> 6143.56s]  That's it.
[6143.56s -> 6144.56s]  Mommy would get mad.
[6144.56s -> 6151.58s]  I've come to get my food stuffs.
[6151.58s -> 6154.65s]  Oh shit.
[6154.65s -> 6155.65s]  I got it.
[6155.65s -> 6158.10s]  Okay.
[6158.10s -> 6161.10s]  Baked yam and a cherry.
[6161.10s -> 6170.98s]  130.
[6170.98s -> 6171.98s]  130%.
[6171.98s -> 6175.12s]  A little bit less.
[6175.12s -> 6176.12s]  One...
[6176.12s -> 6177.12s]  All right.
[6177.12s -> 6185.72s]  3,600.
[6185.72s -> 6186.72s]  Somebody buy the rings.
[6186.72s -> 6191.43s]  What can I get you?
[6191.43s -> 6196.43s]  The adventurer is coming in to get the chocolate.
[6196.43s -> 6205.46s]  I don't know what this guy's deal is.
[6205.46s -> 6209.46s]  Somebody buy a ring.
[6209.46s -> 6216.98s]  I can always rely on you to come in here and just be an absolute moron.
[6216.98s -> 6219.62s]  6,000.
[6219.62s -> 6220.62s]  7,000.
[6220.62s -> 6227.94s]  6,200.
[6227.94s -> 6228.94s]  All right.
[6228.94s -> 6236.26s]  Ah.
[6236.26s -> 6242.43s]  Ah.
[6242.43s -> 6243.43s]  Dammit.
[6243.43s -> 6251.57s]  I'm in a lot of trouble here.
[6251.57s -> 6252.57s]  Okay.
[6252.57s -> 6253.57s]  I can't afford to...
[6253.57s -> 6254.77s]  I have to do the adventuring.
[6254.77s -> 6259.54s]  I need to go find these items.
[6259.54s -> 6262.50s]  So let me see what I gotta do here.
[6262.50s -> 6266.18s]  Merchant skill fusion.
[6266.18s -> 6267.18s]  I need...
[6267.18s -> 6269.33s]  What do I need?
[6269.33s -> 6274.58s]  A backscratcher.
[6274.58s -> 6275.58s]  Three fur balls.
[6275.58s -> 6276.58s]  Okay.
[6276.58s -> 6277.58s]  Three fur balls.
[6277.58s -> 6281.10s]  Should I just make this stupid thing?
[6281.10s -> 6282.10s]  And that guy will...
[6282.10s -> 6283.10s]  That guy will forever.
[6283.10s -> 6288.49s]  He's gonna just keep coming to the store.
[6288.49s -> 6289.49s]  I can get another...
[6289.49s -> 6290.49s]  I can get another...
[6290.49s -> 6293.33s]  Was it?
[6293.33s -> 6294.33s]  Just do it.
[6294.33s -> 6295.63s]  Fuck the Redditor.
[6295.63s -> 6300.08s]  What do you mean the Redditor?
[6300.08s -> 6301.77s]  I'm doing it.
[6301.77s -> 6302.77s]  I have to.
[6302.77s -> 6303.77s]  I'm gonna lose.
[6303.77s -> 6308.52s]  I need to make money.
[6308.52s -> 6311.96s]  Three fur balls.
[6311.96s -> 6312.96s]  One cloth cape.
[6312.96s -> 6332.37s]  Let me get the cloth cape.
[6332.37s -> 6333.37s]  I'm gonna do...
[6333.37s -> 6338.61s]  I'm gonna pull this out of my ass.
[6338.61s -> 6345.86s]  10,000.
[6345.86s -> 6347.78s]  I'm not gonna be able to make this one, unfortunately.
[6347.78s -> 6349.56s]  Not yet.
[6349.56s -> 6352.42s]  But I will be able to do this one.
[6352.42s -> 6353.42s]  Three fur balls.
[6353.42s -> 6354.42s]  Now where am I...
[6354.42s -> 6360.51s]  What's the absolute best way to get those?
[6360.51s -> 6364.02s]  Or one more honey.
[6364.02s -> 6365.26s]  One honey.
[6365.26s -> 6367.48s]  One backscratcher.
[6367.48s -> 6372.63s]  The rabbits.
[6372.67s -> 6373.67s]  Three fur balls.
[6373.67s -> 6374.67s]  One backscratcher.
[6374.67s -> 6376.42s]  One honey.
[6376.42s -> 6384.70s]  I'm going for it.
[6384.70s -> 6385.70s]  Jade Way.
[6385.70s -> 6386.70s]  And it was...
[6386.70s -> 6388.20s]  What?
[6388.20s -> 6389.20s]  Floral, like, 6-10?
[6389.20s -> 6390.20s]  Floral, 11-15?
[6390.20s -> 6398.91s]  The rabbits were in the very beginning, weren't they?
[6398.91s -> 6404.89s]  Just do them all.
[6404.89s -> 6406.37s]  I'm gonna have to do a full tour.
[6406.37s -> 6408.95s]  Yeah.
[6408.95s -> 6409.95s]  I'm going.
[6409.95s -> 6411.23s]  Let's start at the very beginning.
[6411.23s -> 6412.23s]  Welcome to hell.
[6412.23s -> 6425.82s]  I need rabbits.
[6425.82s -> 6430.55s]  Oh, there's this person again.
[6430.55s -> 6441.23s]  Can you accidentally drop 50,000 dollars?
[6441.23s -> 6444.01s]  Hi again.
[6444.01s -> 6445.01s]  Oh my, hello.
[6445.01s -> 6446.01s]  Have we met somewhere?
[6446.01s -> 6447.01s]  Uh, yeah.
[6447.45s -> 6450.65s]  In a way, that's given me a whole lot of deja vu.
[6450.65s -> 6451.65s]  Is that right?
[6451.65s -> 6452.65s]  I'm sorry that I don't remember.
[6452.65s -> 6458.34s]  I take it you are again here by mistake while attempting to get home.
[6458.34s -> 6459.34s]  I'm not quite sure I...
[6459.34s -> 6460.34s]  Wait, am I...
[6460.34s -> 6468.41s]  I'm somewhat not surprised that you did not realize where you were.
[6468.41s -> 6470.93s]  I was just heading home from the market with dinner.
[6470.93s -> 6473.94s]  See, I even have my scallions with me.
[6473.94s -> 6476.74s]  Scallions, I think I could use those.
[6476.74s -> 6479.02s]  Those look great, so perfectly green and tasty.
[6479.02s -> 6483.62s]  Ah, it was quite a good purchase.
[6483.62s -> 6485.10s]  Thank you for buying those for us.
[6485.10s -> 6489.46s]  Wait, I was buying them for you?
[6489.46s -> 6490.46s]  Yes, you were.
[6490.46s -> 6491.46s]  Of course you were.
[6491.46s -> 6495.42s]  I think something more than your sense of direction is off.
[6495.42s -> 6498.93s]  I think I'll have sukiyaki for dinner tonight.
[6498.93s -> 6500.55s]  Sukiyaki?
[6500.55s -> 6503.70s]  I don't know what that is, but it sounds good.
[6503.70s -> 6508.46s]  Can we fix sukiyami for dinner tonight?
[6508.46s -> 6509.46s]  Grain porridge.
[6509.46s -> 6510.46s]  Ever.
[6510.46s -> 6511.46s]  And.
[6511.46s -> 6512.46s]  And on.
[6512.46s -> 6513.95s]  Aww.
[6513.95s -> 6515.98s]  I enjoy your company, you two.
[6515.98s -> 6517.18s]  I must get home, however.
[6517.18s -> 6518.18s]  Stay safe.
[6518.18s -> 6526.58s]  Raincoat.
[6527.22s -> 6528.86s]  I'm not picking up any of this shit.
[6528.86s -> 6530.98s]  I gotta find rabbits and chain them together.
[6530.98s -> 6532.50s]  Alright, where are the rabbits?
[6532.50s -> 6533.50s]  Only kill rabbits.
[6533.50s -> 6534.50s]  Rabbit!
[6534.50s -> 6542.45s]  Only kill rabbits.
[6542.45s -> 6543.45s]  More rabbits!
[6543.45s -> 6546.35s]  Where are they?
[6546.35s -> 6553.91s]  I know there's more rabbits.
[6553.91s -> 6555.60s]  Come on.
[6555.60s -> 6559.80s]  If I sell all these items that I make right now, that's like 45-50 thousand dollars.
[6559.80s -> 6561.94s]  I'll...
[6561.94s -> 6564.34s]  It'll be close, but I'll get there.
[6564.34s -> 6566.56s]  No more rabbits up here?
[6566.64s -> 6574.02s]  Oh, give me a break.
[6581.02s -> 6583.58s]  It's wabbit season.
[6583.58s -> 6594.53s]  No, no more of these coats.
[6594.53s -> 6595.53s]  Duck season.
[6595.53s -> 6596.90s]  Wabbit season.
[6596.90s -> 6597.90s]  Duck season.
[6602.90s -> 6608.54s]  What a classic cartoon comedy.
[6608.54s -> 6609.54s]  Debt season.
[6609.54s -> 6611.10s]  No.
[6611.10s -> 6612.10s]  No.
[6612.10s -> 6613.10s]  I'm not gonna leave.
[6613.10s -> 6615.10s]  Because, look, they just respawn.
[6615.10s -> 6616.10s]  I'm just gonna just...
[6616.70s -> 6617.70s]  I'm just gonna game this completely.
[6617.70s -> 6621.86s]  I'm just gonna walk around the circle until I chain like 30 of them together.
[6621.86s -> 6633.62s]  This is gonna be one rider.
[6633.62s -> 6638.18s]  Dammit.
[6638.18s -> 6639.18s]  I need...
[6639.18s -> 6640.18s]  I still need 120 thousand.
[6640.18s -> 6641.18s]  I could...
[6641.18s -> 6646.72s]  Look, if I liquidate my entire inventory, I'll be able to do it.
[6646.72s -> 6647.72s]  That strategy's not gonna work.
[6647.72s -> 6648.72s]  Let's go.
[6648.72s -> 6651.37s]  Rabbits.
[6651.37s -> 6652.37s]  Oh, a lot of them.
[6652.37s -> 6653.37s]  Come on.
[6653.37s -> 6654.37s]  Yes!
[6654.37s -> 6655.37s]  Alright.
[6655.37s -> 6659.04s]  I need two more of these.
[6659.04s -> 6660.76s]  I do have 15 floors to work with.
[6660.76s -> 6665.46s]  That's true.
[6665.46s -> 6667.46s]  Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit.
[6667.82s -> 6671.77s]  Hey, did you guys know that if you wake up on the first day of spring and say rabbit,
[6671.77s -> 6683.01s]  rabbit, it gives you good luck forever?
[6683.01s -> 6684.01s]  That's not bullshit.
[6684.01s -> 6686.21s]  Like, that's an actual, like, folk tale thing.
[6686.21s -> 6687.70s]  That's not...
[6687.70s -> 6688.70s]  That wasn't a joke.
[6688.70s -> 6689.70s]  I was actually saying that.
[6689.70s -> 6690.70s]  Like, that's a...
[6690.70s -> 6693.70s]  Just a perception of something that was told.
[6693.70s -> 6697.06s]  Alright, well, I'm out of...
[6697.06s -> 6699.06s]  I'm out of things to hit.
[6700.06s -> 6707.08s]  Let me try to get some more items.
[6712.69s -> 6713.69s]  Was that on your Facebook page?
[6713.77s -> 6718.33s]  No, actually, it was on, like, Nickelodeon one time.
[6718.33s -> 6724.33s]  It was one of the in-between advertisements for, like, Doug to Ren and Stimpy.
[6724.33s -> 6730.94s]  I actually think, like, Stick Stickly said it.
[6745.73s -> 6746.73s]  Ooh, gimme...
[6746.73s -> 6748.10s]  Ready?
[6750.10s -> 6751.10s]  How is that not a chain?
[6759.20s -> 6760.20s]  Alright.
[6760.28s -> 6770.07s]  I want more, and I can make it.
[6776.79s -> 6777.79s]  A lot of gnolls.
[6780.10s -> 6781.10s]  Nobody dropped anything.
[6781.10s -> 6784.77s]  Dammit.
[6785.77s -> 6787.77s]  If you crit, it should be a guaranteed item.
[6796.82s -> 6799.44s]  I think I came back up here.
[6802.44s -> 6804.26s]  Done.
[6804.26s -> 6807.06s]  But that doesn't mean we are done, because I still need a backscratcher and I still need
[6807.06s -> 6813.89s]  honey.
[6813.89s -> 6818.15s]  Not even chaining Omega Lol, and I still did it.
[6819.03s -> 6825.26s]  Slime liver.
[6826.26s -> 6827.26s]  Wait, any more of these guys?
[6834.78s -> 6836.66s]  Just a pendant.
[6837.66s -> 6844.01s]  Looks like the backscratcher are from chests or the rat boss.
[6846.85s -> 6848.85s]  That doesn't leave me with very many options, does it?
[6848.85s -> 6854.10s]  You can still get higher grade furball, yeah.
[6860.01s -> 6863.31s]  What were the other items that I needed from, um...
[6866.58s -> 6867.58s]  Furball.
[6871.82s -> 6875.70s]  The honey drops from another lizard, too, yeah.
[6881.62s -> 6883.62s]  Thanks for the boost, I'll take it.
[6885.89s -> 6887.89s]  Honey drops from the bees, I'm assuming, right?
[6895.73s -> 6899.27s]  Lizards.
[6903.88s -> 6904.88s]  Backscratcher in here, come on.
[6916.72s -> 6920.72s]  The honey is really, really expensive, too, so whatever I get out of it, it better be
[6920.72s -> 6923.50s]  good.
[6923.50s -> 6924.50s]  Whatever the crafting is.
[6928.68s -> 6929.68s]  Backscratcher.
[6929.68s -> 6930.68s]  What?
[6930.68s -> 6932.62s]  Is it corn?
[6932.62s -> 6933.62s]  Is it corn on the cob?
[6934.50s -> 6945.47s]  I'm gonna wrap it down here.
[6945.47s -> 6946.47s]  That's what's killed us.
[6949.46s -> 6951.46s]  Alright, let's see if I can get the big slime.
[6958.92s -> 6959.92s]  Drop it.
[6959.92s -> 6960.92s]  Drop it.
[6972.36s -> 6973.36s]  What?
[6973.36s -> 6974.36s]  What was that hitbox?
[6975.36s -> 6976.36s]  Give it to me.
[6976.36s -> 6977.36s]  Is that it?
[6977.36s -> 6978.36s]  I think that's it.
[6979.93s -> 6980.93s]  Is that...
[6980.93s -> 6981.93s]  Slime Lover!
[6981.93s -> 6982.93s]  I got it!
[6982.93s -> 6983.93s]  Okay, okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[6983.93s -> 6995.64s]  I wonder how much that sells for, just normally.
[7007.34s -> 7009.34s]  I'm so happy that I got that.
[7017.18s -> 7023.35s]  You are a winner, so far.
[7026.35s -> 7028.35s]  I'm trying to go too fast.
[7028.35s -> 7035.03s]  Save it for the Redditor.
[7035.03s -> 7038.03s]  Why do you guys keep calling that guy a Redditor?
[7038.91s -> 7040.91s]  Is that just going way over my head?
[7040.91s -> 7047.42s]  Why is he a Redditor?
[7047.42s -> 7058.06s]  He feels like a Redditor.
[7058.06s -> 7060.06s]  I don't know what that means.
[7060.06s -> 7062.06s]  He feels like a Redditor.
[7062.06s -> 7064.06s]  This is worth 6,300 bucks.
[7064.06s -> 7079.30s]  I didn't know that you could classify somebody like that.
[7079.30s -> 7080.86s]  That's not a bad...
[7080.86s -> 7081.86s]  That's a long go.
[7081.86s -> 7084.86s]  I'm getting some good items down here.
[7084.86s -> 7088.48s]  I don't want that.
[7088.48s -> 7089.48s]  Backscratcher.
[7090.73s -> 7091.73s]  Damn it.
[7091.73s -> 7101.71s]  That's because you don't identify as a Redditor.
[7101.71s -> 7102.71s]  You don't understand.
[7105.87s -> 7106.87s]  No, I don't.
[7106.87s -> 7107.87s]  I don't understand.
[7108.87s -> 7109.87s]  Bingo!
[7112.33s -> 7124.19s]  And you didn't think I was going to get to 200,000.
[7124.19s -> 7125.19s]  I still don't.
[7125.19s -> 7128.19s]  But anyways, what I was trying to say is...
[7128.19s -> 7129.19s]  How does...
[7129.19s -> 7134.19s]  I don't know how you identify yourself as reading the news from a website.
[7136.62s -> 7147.76s]  I don't understand.
[7147.76s -> 7148.76s]  News.
[7149.64s -> 7154.12s]  He only reads the news.
[7154.12s -> 7155.12s]  I don't know.
[7155.12s -> 7157.74s]  What do you do on Reddit?
[7157.74s -> 7159.74s]  Besides read the news.
[7168.42s -> 7169.42s]  Boots!
[7172.96s -> 7176.82s]  Any more rabbits?
[7177.82s -> 7178.82s]  Who the fuck?
[7178.82s -> 7184.16s]  What are you guys doing down here?
[7184.16s -> 7185.16s]  Oh, receipt!
[7185.16s -> 7190.98s]  What a coincidence meeting you here.
[7190.98s -> 7193.98s]  I identify as a Wall Street Journaler.
[7193.98s -> 7199.10s]  How are you, Alouette?
[7199.10s -> 7201.10s]  Oh, you're dungeon crawling as well, I see.
[7201.10s -> 7205.18s]  And with such a seedy-looking adventurer.
[7206.06s -> 7211.92s]  My adventurer friend isn't seedy-looking, and we did this joke already.
[7211.92s -> 7212.92s]  Self-aware.
[7212.92s -> 7214.29s]  I like it.
[7214.29s -> 7217.29s]  I suppose a seedy adventurer is appropriate for a seedy merchant.
[7217.29s -> 7222.34s]  Anyone else feel like that was backwards?
[7222.34s -> 7225.78s]  That if you play that in reverse, it'll sound like a regular laugh?
[7225.78s -> 7232.88s]  That's how they do that, right?
[7232.88s -> 7233.88s]  Well, come on, everyone.
[7233.88s -> 7235.88s]  Don't bother picking up the inexpensive garbage.
[7235.88s -> 7236.88s]  Only the best for us.
[7236.88s -> 7247.75s]  It would be so funny if this thing just grabbed her and punched her in the face.
[7248.75s -> 7252.82s]  You have like four adventurers!
[7253.70s -> 7254.70s]  That's stupid.
[7254.70s -> 7267.78s]  That's not fair.
[7267.78s -> 7279.46s]  Damn it!
[7279.46s -> 7280.46s]  He knew.
[7280.46s -> 7294.39s]  Well, any more of those gnolls?
[7294.39s -> 7295.39s]  No.
[7295.39s -> 7297.39s]  Might as well get a double.
[7297.39s -> 7301.74s]  You'll never understand the struggles of a Redditor.
[7301.74s -> 7303.74s]  Go back to 4chan.
[7318.58s -> 7320.46s]  Floor 8.
[7320.46s -> 7321.46s]  Let's go.
[7321.46s -> 7326.02s]  What'd she say?
[7326.02s -> 7331.02s]  I need my, like, I need my, like, Redditors to translate that.
[7331.02s -> 7334.02s]  Ooh, a sack of gold!
[7334.02s -> 7335.02s]  Nut mix.
[7343.49s -> 7352.81s]  Did I invest in Bitcoin?
[7352.81s -> 7356.90s]  I don't, I don't even know what that is.
[7356.90s -> 7365.12s]  I've heard of that before.
[7369.02s -> 7374.70s]  Just get out of my way, thing.
[7374.70s -> 7387.07s]  I do like this little item run, though.
[7387.07s -> 7393.94s]  I know that it was, it was like, it was like a scam, right?
[7393.94s -> 7399.12s]  That's all I, all I remember.
[7399.12s -> 7401.12s]  It was like a scam or something, right?
[7401.12s -> 7406.62s]  That's what somebody in the office told me.
[7409.92s -> 7421.02s]  I need to get rid of something.
[7421.02s -> 7422.02s]  What do I get rid of?
[7422.02s -> 7423.02s]  Everything I have?
[7423.02s -> 7424.02s]  The raincoats?
[7424.02s -> 7425.02s]  The raincoats are shitty.
[7425.02s -> 7431.80s]  I have, I need the fur balls.
[7431.80s -> 7434.87s]  The insect traps.
[7434.87s -> 7435.87s]  The nut mix is a thousand.
[7435.87s -> 7441.80s]  I'm just gonna eat the chocolate.
[7441.80s -> 7442.80s]  Backscratcher.
[7442.80s -> 7445.04s]  I mean, that's still pretty good.
[7445.04s -> 7458.50s]  I have one extra, but what if I need it?
[7458.50s -> 7464.50s]  Why is Dermis such a Redditor?
[7464.50s -> 7465.50s]  It's freaking me out.
[7465.50s -> 7472.94s]  I don't even know what you're talking about!
[7473.88s -> 7489.54s]  This is so over my head, it's freaking me out.
[7489.54s -> 7503.94s]  Why do you eat like a Redditor?
[7503.94s -> 7504.94s]  No, I don't want this.
[7504.94s -> 7514.66s]  I have one extra fur ball, but I'm probably gonna need it if I wanted to ever do this
[7514.66s -> 7516.15s]  again.
[7516.15s -> 7517.15s]  Should I?
[7517.15s -> 7522.50s]  Get rid of this charm.
[7522.50s -> 7523.94s]  Backscratcher.
[7523.94s -> 7524.94s]  Fuck.
[7524.94s -> 7531.38s]  Please do the nice girl laugh.
[7531.38s -> 7538.84s]  Get rid of the shitty fur ball, but I might need it.
[7538.84s -> 7555.58s]  If I get enough of those fur balls, I can make two.
[7556.22s -> 7557.72s]  Count them.
[7557.72s -> 7558.72s]  Two!
[7558.72s -> 7562.97s]  Two!
[7562.97s -> 7563.97s]  Two!
[7563.97s -> 7565.46s]  Triple kill.
[7565.46s -> 7568.83s]  I need a lizard too.
[7568.83s -> 7569.83s]  Lizard.
[7569.83s -> 7570.83s]  Lizard.
[7570.83s -> 7571.83s]  No lizard.
[7571.83s -> 7573.26s]  Bullshit.
[7573.26s -> 7579.26s]  I don't want the cherry.
[7579.26s -> 7589.20s]  Maybe I'll get it from the rat.
[7589.20s -> 7590.20s]  Can't carry anymore.
[7590.20s -> 7591.20s]  Wooden shield.
[7591.20s -> 7592.20s]  Garbage.
[7592.20s -> 7593.20s]  Raincoat.
[7593.20s -> 7597.19s]  Garbage.
[7597.19s -> 7598.19s]  Bra.
[7598.19s -> 7599.19s]  I don't need a bra.
[7599.19s -> 7600.19s]  I'm gonna throw it away.
[7604.02s -> 7607.46s]  Alright, I'll get rid of one fur ball.
[7607.46s -> 7610.11s]  And the bra.
[7610.11s -> 7611.37s]  It's 800 bucks though.
[7611.37s -> 7626.50s]  I can't.
[7626.50s -> 7628.50s]  I can't.
[7628.50s -> 7629.50s]  I can't.
[7629.50s -> 7634.33s]  I need...
[7634.33s -> 7636.85s]  Here we go.
[7636.85s -> 7637.85s]  Backscratcher from the rat.
[7637.85s -> 7653.30s]  Here comes Ratwheel.
[7653.30s -> 7656.30s]  Oops, I forgot you could do that.
[7656.30s -> 7657.30s]  Eat.
[7657.30s -> 7658.30s]  Eat.
[7658.30s -> 7660.37s]  Eat.
[7660.37s -> 7666.67s]  Oh, that is a heal.
[7666.67s -> 7680.81s]  I'm not sure I contemplated if that was gonna be a heal.
[7680.81s -> 7681.81s]  Eat one.
[7681.81s -> 7686.49s]  Eat it.
[7686.49s -> 7694.61s]  Stop making me contemplate.
[7694.61s -> 7708.42s]  Alright, backscratcher do it.
[7708.42s -> 7709.42s]  Come on please.
[7709.42s -> 7710.70s]  I need this.
[7710.70s -> 7715.02s]  I need this.
[7715.02s -> 7716.02s]  Well, I got...
[7716.02s -> 7717.51s]  Okay.
[7718.39s -> 7721.74s]  I need to get another child.
[7721.74s -> 7733.10s]  So, what was the last thing I needed for that stupid order?
[7733.10s -> 7735.32s]  I needed the lizard.
[7735.32s -> 7737.04s]  I needed the batwing.
[7737.04s -> 7739.62s]  I got it.
[7739.62s -> 7744.83s]  It's probably gonna be a shitload of money, isn't it?
[7744.83s -> 7748.89s]  Okay, it may be time to call it a day here.
[7748.89s -> 7760.41s]  Because I'm running out of room.
[7760.41s -> 7761.97s]  Yeah, it's time to go.
[7761.97s -> 7764.17s]  No, not the stream.
[7764.17s -> 7765.17s]  I'm talking about the run.
[7765.17s -> 7769.75s]  Yeah, I gotta go back.
[7769.75s -> 7770.75s]  I gotta...
[7770.75s -> 7771.75s]  Here.
[7771.75s -> 7772.75s]  I gotta...
[7773.61s -> 7778.43s]  You know what I'm saying?
[7778.43s -> 7792.89s]  This is my last shot these next couple days.
[7792.89s -> 7795.85s]  Alright, news.
[7795.85s -> 7798.85s]  The price of food has decreased.
[7798.85s -> 7800.85s]  The price of swords has normalized.
[7800.85s -> 7804.72s]  Whatever.
[7804.72s -> 7810.14s]  So, fusion time.
[7810.14s -> 7814.26s]  I have 48 hours.
[7814.26s -> 7815.88s]  Time for fusion.
[7815.88s -> 7822.56s]  First of all, the dude's gonna come back.
[7822.56s -> 7824.56s]  I have it all.
[7824.56s -> 7827.00s]  And then I need two hats for today as well.
[7827.00s -> 7832.74s]  Here we go.
[7832.74s -> 7834.81s]  Fusion.
[7834.81s -> 7836.59s]  Rank 1 staff.
[7836.59s -> 7839.59s]  I don't have the back scratcher required, but I have the other stuff.
[7839.59s -> 7841.07s]  I need a sturdy glove.
[7841.07s -> 7849.24s]  So, that's one there.
[7849.24s -> 7850.24s]  Okay.
[7850.24s -> 7852.31s]  Ready?
[7852.31s -> 7862.63s]  This took a long time to make.
[7862.63s -> 7867.27s]  It's a, like, Fourth of July hat, and it's 3,800 bucks.
[7867.27s -> 7878.36s]  Wonderful.
[7878.36s -> 7879.36s]  Okay.
[7879.36s -> 7880.36s]  That...
[7880.36s -> 7881.36s]  I need a sturdy glove.
[7881.36s -> 7888.28s]  Shit, better be worth it.
[7894.59s -> 7899.07s]  Like, 15, at least.
[7899.07s -> 7900.07s]  No.
[7900.07s -> 7901.07s]  3850.
[7901.07s -> 7902.07s]  That's nothing.
[7902.07s -> 7906.83s]  Shit.
[7906.83s -> 7921.45s]  I'm in trouble now.
[7921.45s -> 7951.98s]  I could have just sold the three honey for, like, 8,060.
[7951.98s -> 7960.37s]  It's gonna be close.
[7960.37s -> 7963.91s]  Just put the most, just put only expensive shit up here.
[7963.91s -> 7980.12s]  Nothing else.
[7980.12s -> 7982.20s]  But what if he comes back?
[7982.20s -> 7983.20s]  Okay.
[7983.20s -> 7987.15s]  If he comes back, what if he gives me a ton of money?
[7987.15s -> 7989.15s]  What if he's, like, a trillionaire or something?
[7989.15s -> 7997.52s]  Alright, here we go.
[7997.52s -> 8007.97s]  I only have the expensive shit up.
[8008.41s -> 8012.73s]  I need, I need these two hats, because I'm gonna, this is gonna be an extremely expensive
[8012.73s -> 8013.73s]  two hats for that lady.
[8013.73s -> 8015.41s]  I don't want to put them out.
[8015.41s -> 8020.61s]  There's a lady coming in today that wants two hats.
[8020.61s -> 8035.04s]  Let's go.
[8035.04s -> 8043.44s]  Welcome to...
[8043.44s -> 8044.44s]  Oh, right.
[8044.44s -> 8045.44s]  There is!
[8045.44s -> 8046.44s]  Okay.
[8046.44s -> 8048.64s]  Like, 50 grand.
[8048.64s -> 8049.84s]  Did you finally manage to get my order?
[8049.84s -> 8051.85s]  I did.
[8051.85s -> 8054.09s]  Is your last supposed to creep out the customers?
[8054.09s -> 8055.09s]  Or is that just money?
[8055.09s -> 8056.09s]  Give me some money.
[8056.09s -> 8057.09s]  Look, and you got, like, a prince cape on.
[8057.09s -> 8058.09s]  You have, like, an outfit on.
[8058.09s -> 8059.09s]  You have a big collar.
[8059.21s -> 8062.85s]  You're like Dracula or you're a prince that has a lot of money.
[8062.85s -> 8063.85s]  Either one.
[8063.85s -> 8068.01s]  Dracula also probably has a lot of money.
[8068.01s -> 8069.01s]  What are the name of...
[8069.01s -> 8070.01s]  Duh-duh-duh.
[8070.01s -> 8071.01s]  Have you no shame?
[8071.01s -> 8073.21s]  You're not happy?
[8073.21s -> 8075.97s]  Given how long I had to wait for this.
[8075.97s -> 8078.56s]  Well, whatever.
[8078.56s -> 8080.28s]  I did put in the order.
[8080.28s -> 8082.34s]  And I, sorry.
[8082.34s -> 8084.18s]  And I do still need these.
[8084.18s -> 8085.74s]  So I'll go ahead and take them now.
[8085.74s -> 8086.74s]  Here's the fee.
[8086.74s -> 8089.74s]  Thank the owner for me.
[8089.74s -> 8091.58s]  Despite the delay, I do appreciate the help.
[8091.58s -> 8093.61s]  How much money is it?
[8093.61s -> 8095.89s]  I told you I am the owner.
[8095.89s -> 8096.89s]  I don't care how much money.
[8096.89s -> 8100.80s]  You really don't know when to give up on a prank, do you?
[8100.80s -> 8103.84s]  In any event, you do need to learn to deal with customers better.
[8103.84s -> 8108.36s]  I'll be coming in here more often from now on, so expect good service.
[8108.36s -> 8110.63s]  What's the fee?
[8110.63s -> 8112.51s]  I can deal with normal customers just fine.
[8112.51s -> 8115.86s]  Thank you.
[8115.86s -> 8116.86s]  What was it?
[8116.86s -> 8117.86s]  That was it?
[8117.86s -> 8118.86s]  3,800.
[8118.86s -> 8119.86s]  That's it?
[8119.86s -> 8121.68s]  That's it.
[8121.68s -> 8122.68s]  It's over.
[8122.68s -> 8123.68s]  I lose.
[8123.68s -> 8128.95s]  I was really riding on that being at least 20.
[8128.95s -> 8131.08s]  Okay.
[8131.08s -> 8132.56s]  34,000.
[8132.56s -> 8133.56s]  It's in high demand.
[8133.56s -> 8140.88s]  It's a hot item.
[8141.72s -> 8151.20s]  I can't charge $120,000.
[8151.20s -> 8153.40s]  I have to sell it.
[8153.40s -> 8154.40s]  2,900.
[8154.40s -> 8161.08s]  2,800.
[8161.08s -> 8168.30s]  I need to sell things.
[8168.30s -> 8171.75s]  Somebody buy one of the 15, $20,000 items.
[8171.75s -> 8172.75s]  Can I get a book?
[8172.75s -> 8175.32s]  I don't have any books.
[8175.32s -> 8176.32s]  Go home.
[8176.32s -> 8182.49s]  Grandpa.
[8182.49s -> 8185.66s]  Grandpa wants to buy a treasure.
[8185.66s -> 8191.38s]  No, this one on the table.
[8191.38s -> 8194.99s]  This one on the table.
[8194.99s -> 8199.71s]  This one's sitting right over there.
[8199.71s -> 8201.71s]  Can I just use a ring?
[8201.71s -> 8208.16s]  I think this is what you're looking for.
[8208.16s -> 8214.47s]  Not what I wanted.
[8214.47s -> 8215.47s]  The hats.
[8215.47s -> 8234.62s]  I'm so fucked.
[8234.62s -> 8238.55s]  It's not going to happen.
[8238.55s -> 8239.55s]  13,000.
[8239.55s -> 8240.55s]  14,000.
[8240.55s -> 8242.94s]  13.
[8242.94s -> 8248.34s]  Fuck.
[8248.34s -> 8268.22s]  I'm only $100,000 away.
[8268.22s -> 8287.12s]  God damn it.
[8287.12s -> 8290.54s]  Somebody buy this shit.
[8290.54s -> 8293.59s]  Somebody buy it now.
[8293.79s -> 8296.06s]  I have expensive items.
[8296.06s -> 8298.00s]  Okay.
[8298.00s -> 8302.20s]  I can do that.
[8302.20s -> 8303.20s]  7,500.
[8303.20s -> 8310.16s]  That's 220.
[8310.16s -> 8312.40s]  Higher than 220?
[8312.40s -> 8317.05s]  8,000?
[8317.05s -> 8318.05s]  I can do it.
[8318.05s -> 8319.05s]  I can do it.
[8319.05s -> 8322.28s]  I can do this.
[8322.28s -> 8324.67s]  Come on.
[8324.67s -> 8325.67s]  Piece of armor.
[8325.67s -> 8332.27s]  I mean, that's technically armor, isn't it?
[8332.27s -> 8337.48s]  The power glove is armor.
[8337.48s -> 8342.41s]  This is armor.
[8342.41s -> 8343.41s]  The cape is armor.
[8343.41s -> 8349.90s]  $15,000.
[8349.90s -> 8355.88s]  It's armor.
[8355.88s -> 8358.08s]  It's not armor.
[8358.08s -> 8359.08s]  You guys lied.
[8362.83s -> 8369.95s]  I don't want to spend fucking $1,000.
[8369.95s -> 8370.95s]  Go home.
[8370.95s -> 8374.16s]  I need to open this door again.
[8374.16s -> 8376.16s]  Somebody just take a ring or the power glove.
[8376.16s -> 8377.16s]  Wait a minute.
[8377.16s -> 8378.16s]  It's the prince.
[8378.16s -> 8381.65s]  Hey, it came by to sell this to you.
[8381.65s -> 8388.44s]  No, not you two.
[8388.44s -> 8392.48s]  Somebody poisoned you out there and now you're part of like the yam.
[8392.48s -> 8393.48s]  The scams.
[8393.48s -> 8402.08s]  Here we go.
[8402.08s -> 8406.62s]  This is the day where everyone's going to die.
[8407.58s -> 8408.58s]  I don't want this.
[8408.58s -> 8409.58s]  Please.
[8409.58s -> 8411.26s]  Just somebody buy something.
[8411.26s -> 8413.78s]  I don't want to buy your things.
[8413.78s -> 8415.06s]  I want you to buy my things.
[8415.06s -> 8430.46s]  I have to open the store again.
[8430.46s -> 8431.46s]  Put out food.
[8431.46s -> 8434.87s]  Put the cape out.
[8434.87s -> 8436.27s]  All this shit is already here.
[8436.27s -> 8452.25s]  No, the food is...
[8452.25s -> 8453.93s]  I'm going to put the boots out.
[8453.93s -> 8455.37s]  I'll put the chest out.
[8455.37s -> 8464.55s]  Let's go.
[8464.55s -> 8470.35s]  Here are the boots.
[8470.35s -> 8474.48s]  I'll do 120.
[8474.48s -> 8476.49s]  Cape.
[8476.49s -> 8480.55s]  All right.
[8480.55s -> 8483.58s]  All right.
[8484.42s -> 8496.65s]  We got a big sale here, except it's this cheap lady, 18,000.
[8496.65s -> 8497.65s]  She's not going to buy it.
[8497.65s -> 8498.65s]  She's going to walk out.
[8498.65s -> 8501.52s]  I cannot afford this lady to walk out right now.
[8501.52s -> 8506.91s]  I'm going to say 18,5 or 20.
[8506.91s -> 8507.91s]  No, no, no, no.
[8507.91s -> 8508.91s]  That's too high.
[8508.91s -> 8509.91s]  She'll...
[8509.91s -> 8511.47s]  She always says no.
[8511.47s -> 8516.23s]  She's going to say no.
[8516.23s -> 8517.51s]  She's not going to back down.
[8517.51s -> 8518.51s]  I have to do 18.
[8518.51s -> 8519.51s]  Otherwise I lose.
[8519.51s -> 8531.77s]  In fact, we're doing 17,9 or 17, like five.
[8531.77s -> 8532.95s]  Yeah.
[8532.95s -> 8533.95s]  I can't afford to lose this.
[8534.15s -> 8541.68s]  So I have to sell this.
[8541.68s -> 8542.68s]  Come on.
[8542.68s -> 8543.84s]  I can do this.
[8543.84s -> 8544.84s]  I can do this.
[8544.84s -> 8545.84s]  I have one more day.
[8545.84s -> 8546.84s]  I just have to make a little bit more money and I'm done.
[8546.84s -> 8557.87s]  I just have to make like 60,000.
[8557.87s -> 8567.03s]  The price of precious metals has decreased.
[8567.03s -> 8568.03s]  Get the staff up here.
[8568.03s -> 8577.16s]  There's no way I'm going to have 75,000 in one day, but there is a way, and that is I
[8577.16s -> 8582.62s]  liquidate everything I own at the store downstream.
[8582.62s -> 8583.62s]  It might happen.
[8583.62s -> 8589.08s]  It's today.
[8589.08s -> 8602.77s]  It's at the end of the day today.
[8603.25s -> 8607.25s]  I have three save files that are all like 30 minutes apart.
[8607.25s -> 8614.66s]  This is like an hour apart from this.
[8614.66s -> 8615.66s]  Let's hold on.
[8615.66s -> 8616.94s]  Let's just see what happens here.
[8616.94s -> 8626.11s]  I'm okay with liquidating stuff if it means to stay alive.
[8626.11s -> 8636.01s]  I think if I liquidate everything, I'll be able to stay alive.
[8636.01s -> 8645.27s]  I'm going to try it.
[8645.27s -> 8646.27s]  Fill the counters.
[8646.27s -> 8647.27s]  I'm going to...
[8647.27s -> 8651.39s]  What do I have here?
[8651.39s -> 8652.39s]  I don't want to sell the foods.
[8652.39s -> 8654.39s]  No, we'll put a baked yam out there.
[8654.39s -> 8657.68s]  All right.
[8657.68s -> 8658.68s]  Let's go.
[8658.68s -> 8665.55s]  All right.
[8665.55s -> 8669.60s]  Grandpa wants the boots.
[8669.68s -> 8670.68s]  Bring it down a little bit.
[8670.68s -> 8671.68s]  I can do that for you.
[8671.68s -> 8676.25s]  2,000.
[8676.25s -> 8677.25s]  Come on.
[8677.25s -> 8681.35s]  Big item up top.
[8681.35s -> 8684.49s]  This is a present from my brother.
[8684.49s -> 8685.49s]  You ne...
[8685.49s -> 8686.49s]  Okay.
[8686.49s -> 8687.49s]  You never buy.
[8687.49s -> 8692.06s]  1,850.
[8692.06s -> 8693.06s]  Hot items.
[8693.06s -> 8694.06s]  Hot items.
[8694.06s -> 8695.06s]  Hot.
[8695.06s -> 8696.06s]  All right.
[8696.06s -> 8697.06s]  He's going to get a hot item.
[8697.06s -> 8698.06s]  Oh, no.
[8698.06s -> 8719.58s]  Stop selling me food.
[8719.58s -> 8721.94s]  Of course, the girl that doesn't want to pay more than 110%.
[8721.94s -> 8730.41s]  Come on.
[8730.41s -> 8731.41s]  He always...
[8731.41s -> 8732.41s]  This guy is so dumb.
[8732.41s -> 8734.41s]  He always buys the most expensive shit in the store.
[8735.84s -> 8744.88s]  I need two cold weather clothes in two days.
[8744.88s -> 8745.88s]  Come on.
[8745.88s -> 8747.89s]  No.
[8747.89s -> 8748.89s]  No.
[8748.89s -> 8764.08s]  Come on, old man.
[8764.08s -> 8765.08s]  No.
[8765.08s -> 8767.08s]  You want us to buy some candy?
[8767.08s -> 8816.36s]  We're going to have to do some liquidation.
[8816.36s -> 8834.60s]  Put the rings in the window.
[8834.60s -> 8836.60s]  I've got these awesome things in the window already.
[8836.60s -> 8837.60s]  You know, and only...
[8837.60s -> 8840.04s]  People only buy candy.
[8840.04s -> 8846.12s]  No, I don't want to put on a bunch of cheap shit.
[8846.12s -> 8847.12s]  I'm going to go...
[8847.12s -> 8854.24s]  We're going with this.
[8854.24s -> 8855.24s]  There we go.
[8855.24s -> 8856.24s]  All right.
[8860.75s -> 8861.75s]  7500.
[8861.75s -> 8864.44s]  It's that much.
[8864.44s -> 8866.44s]  You can't bring it down at all.
[8866.44s -> 8869.36s]  I can do 7200.
[8869.36s -> 8870.36s]  No.
[8870.36s -> 8878.20s]  7000.
[8878.20s -> 8897.87s]  Come on.
[8897.87s -> 8898.87s]  Buy the cloak.
[8898.87s -> 8902.00s]  Oh, I was looking for this.
[8902.00s -> 8913.18s]  I don't want some fucking...
[8913.18s -> 8914.18s]  No.
[8914.18s -> 8922.24s]  I don't want it.
[8922.24s -> 8924.67s]  I don't want it.
[8924.67s -> 8931.45s]  I don't want it.
[8931.45s -> 8933.45s]  Oh, it was so cheap.
[8933.45s -> 8937.84s]  Somebody buy an expensive thing.
[8937.84s -> 8939.02s]  Looking for a treasure.
[8939.02s -> 8942.02s]  I don't have treasures here.
[8942.02s -> 8944.02s]  Here, have an unthankful statue.
[8944.02s -> 8962.45s]  At least I'll be able to sell it.
[8962.45s -> 8967.96s]  Mommy told me to buy this.
[8967.96s -> 8968.96s]  This girl.
[8968.96s -> 8971.96s]  I have to get it off the counter.
[8971.96s -> 8972.96s]  You've got to be kidding me.
[8972.96s -> 8974.96s]  You've got to be kidding me.
[8974.96s -> 8976.96s]  This is a racket right now.
[8976.96s -> 8977.96s]  Unbelievable.
[8977.96s -> 8981.09s]  It is getting dumb.
[8981.09s -> 8984.04s]  I'm in so much trouble.
[8984.04s -> 8987.60s]  The price of a heavy armor has decreased.
[8987.60s -> 9006.86s]  Flee the country.
[9006.86s -> 9009.68s]  Just get on a plane.
[9009.68s -> 9010.68s]  It's still possible.
[9010.68s -> 9011.68s]  It is.
[9011.68s -> 9019.36s]  I have to sell this stuff.
[9019.36s -> 9020.36s]  Get the...
[9020.36s -> 9022.36s]  Put the ring up here.
[9022.36s -> 9024.36s]  Where's my expensive ring?
[9024.36s -> 9025.66s]  7000.
[9025.66s -> 9033.98s]  How much is this one?
[9033.98s -> 9041.34s]  Get the food off the shelves.
[9041.34s -> 9050.08s]  Is it possible that I just only have the stuff in the window?
[9050.08s -> 9052.08s]  This is what's in here.
[9052.08s -> 9056.76s]  And then I can liquidate some stuff.
[9056.76s -> 9061.90s]  Sell everything in the market.
[9061.90s -> 9063.90s]  That's why I have that save point.
[9063.90s -> 9070.94s]  I'll have some of these out.
[9070.94s -> 9076.06s]  I have to make the money.
[9076.06s -> 9078.24s]  Let's have a little candy counter here.
[9078.24s -> 9084.83s]  Food counter.
[9084.83s -> 9086.83s]  Let's just go.
[9086.83s -> 9087.83s]  Open.
[9087.83s -> 9093.33s]  You actually want the ring.
[9093.33s -> 9095.02s]  Holy shit.
[9095.02s -> 9096.02s]  Okay.
[9096.02s -> 9098.02s]  She's not going to buy...
[9098.02s -> 9099.02s]  I have to start at base.
[9099.02s -> 9100.02s]  She's not...
[9100.02s -> 9101.02s]  Alright.
[9101.02s -> 9111.48s]  Come on.
[9111.48s -> 9113.48s]  Come on.
[9113.48s -> 9115.48s]  I can still do it.
[9115.48s -> 9126.70s]  Come on.
[9126.70s -> 9128.70s]  Somebody buy that cape.
[9128.70s -> 9141.82s]  Rich girl.
[9141.82s -> 9144.64s]  Rich girl wants to sell me an apple.
[9144.64s -> 9146.64s]  Doesn't ever want to buy anything.
[9146.64s -> 9157.48s]  Come on.
[9157.48s -> 9159.87s]  Can I get a book?
[9159.87s -> 9160.87s]  I don't have any books.
[9160.87s -> 9164.87s]  I just need like a few more sales and I will be able to get there.
[9164.87s -> 9165.87s]  Come on.
[9165.87s -> 9169.09s]  Prints.
[9169.09s -> 9172.09s]  Two weapons and I want them in three days.
[9172.09s -> 9173.09s]  Sure.
[9173.09s -> 9174.09s]  Oh fuck.
[9174.09s -> 9176.09s]  I forgot about the guy that wanted stuff in two days.
[9176.09s -> 9177.09s]  What did he want?
[9177.09s -> 9186.08s]  Okay.
[9186.08s -> 9187.08s]  In two days.
[9187.08s -> 9190.94s]  Too cold weather.
[9190.94s -> 9193.65s]  This is it.
[9193.65s -> 9194.65s]  This is how possible I was.
[9194.65s -> 9210.29s]  I might as well just accept my fate right now.
[9210.29s -> 9211.29s]  But hold on.
[9211.29s -> 9212.29s]  We don't even know what happens.
[9212.29s -> 9223.04s]  We don't even know what happens.
[9223.04s -> 9226.20s]  What happens?
[9226.20s -> 9245.04s]  What now?
[9245.04s -> 9250.08s]  I'm afraid this amount of money is insufficient.
[9250.08s -> 9254.08s]  I'm sorry, but as an agent of Termi Finance, I must now seize this house in order to repay
[9254.08s -> 9255.08s]  the outstanding debt.
[9255.08s -> 9274.33s]  And so the cute, courageous little heroine was crushed by the cruel bitterness of reality.
[9274.33s -> 9275.33s]  Wow.
[9275.33s -> 9278.92s]  Why did it have to end in a box?
[9278.92s -> 9291.32s]  This is a dream, right?
[9291.32s -> 9292.32s]  This must be a joke.
[9292.32s -> 9296.39s]  If I did not know any better, I'd say you were in a coma.
[9296.39s -> 9297.39s]  Huh?
[9297.39s -> 9298.39s]  I'm asleep.
[9298.39s -> 9299.39s]  Hmm.
[9299.39s -> 9300.39s]  Tira was just a dream, I guess.
[9300.39s -> 9301.39s]  That dream seems so real, though.
[9301.39s -> 9304.59s]  I thought, I mean, I liked, uh...
[9304.59s -> 9305.59s]  Hmm.
[9305.59s -> 9307.79s]  Pillow.
[9307.79s -> 9308.79s]  Would you wake up, please?
[9308.79s -> 9315.40s]  I didn't shoot the sheriff, I swear.
[9315.40s -> 9316.40s]  Oh, Tira.
[9316.40s -> 9317.40s]  Morning.
[9317.40s -> 9319.71s]  You're still half asleep, I suspect.
[9319.71s -> 9321.71s]  Reset, you are the proprietor of an item shop.
[9321.71s -> 9324.71s]  Now, you must learn to be responsible and not sleep the day away.
[9324.71s -> 9325.71s]  You're right.
[9325.71s -> 9326.71s]  I...
[9326.71s -> 9327.71s]  I don't remember.
[9327.71s -> 9331.40s]  You can't seemingly be awake and asleep at the same time.
[9331.40s -> 9334.40s]  It'd be a wonder if it did not fill me with blind, hopeless terror.
[9334.40s -> 9338.70s]  Yesterday, we paid our respects at the Merchants Guild and then briefly opened shop.
[9338.70s -> 9339.70s]  Have you already forgotten?
[9339.70s -> 9340.70s]  What do you mean, paid?
[9340.70s -> 9341.70s]  Is Lily dead?
[9341.70s -> 9345.16s]  From this day forth, we are now in business properly.
[9345.16s -> 9348.16s]  The way this is going, though, I fear for the future.
[9348.16s -> 9349.84s]  That's right.
[9349.84s -> 9350.84s]  We're in business.
[9350.84s -> 9353.34s]  By the name of heaven, are you smiling so much?
[9353.34s -> 9356.69s]  Oh, no reason.
[9356.69s -> 9358.69s]  I just think I saw something nice in my dreams.
[9358.69s -> 9361.12s]  Tira, let's give it our all.
[9361.12s -> 9365.30s]  Well, if you really are dedicated to making this work, wash yourself and meet me downstairs.
[9365.30s -> 9366.30s]  What day is it?
[9366.30s -> 9373.11s]  What?
[9373.11s -> 9385.23s]  You...
[9385.23s -> 9386.23s]  What?
[9386.23s -> 9393.24s]  So, I have an item shop and stuff and it's all cool and awesome.
[9393.24s -> 9395.24s]  So, what do I do now?
[9395.24s -> 9399.11s]  What?
[9399.11s -> 9403.76s]  Why am I getting this all over again?
[9403.76s -> 9413.16s]  Okay, we did this already.
[9413.16s -> 9420.80s]  You keep your levels and your stuff, but you don't keep money.
[9420.80s -> 9430.16s]  Oh, so you're supposed to lose.
[9430.16s -> 9444.21s]  Safe's coming, buy everything.
[9444.21s -> 9456.99s]  Did it go drop like $150,000?
[9456.99s -> 9463.94s]  Well, I'll at least be able to pay off the debt.
[9463.94s -> 9465.88s]  What about, like, event...
[9465.88s -> 9466.88s]  Hold on.
[9466.88s -> 9467.88s]  This is...
[9467.88s -> 9468.88s]  What about adventure guild shit?
[9468.88s -> 9473.71s]  Hold...
[9473.71s -> 9474.71s]  Wait a minute.
[9474.71s -> 9483.24s]  This is important.
[9483.24s -> 9484.24s]  Oh, shit.
[9484.24s -> 9486.44s]  I got to do this all over again?
[9486.44s -> 9487.44s]  Hold on.
[9487.44s -> 9499.05s]  Wait a minute.
[9499.05s -> 9500.05s]  I just want to see what happens.
[9500.05s -> 9501.05s]  Let me just see.
[9501.05s -> 9504.60s]  Let me check something here real quick.
[9504.60s -> 9511.72s]  I just want to see if this is possible.
[9511.72s -> 9515.40s]  Right here.
[9515.40s -> 9516.40s]  I just want to check something.
[9516.40s -> 9531.14s]  You keep everything but money.
[9531.14s -> 9532.14s]  I just...
[9532.14s -> 9533.14s]  I just want to see if this is possible.
[9533.14s -> 9539.50s]  Just out of curiosity.
[9539.50s -> 9591.94s]  No.
[9591.94s -> 9595.04s]  No, it's not even close.
[9595.04s -> 9599.16s]  Fuck.
[9599.16s -> 9600.65s]  Well, we're going to have to do it.
[9600.65s -> 9601.65s]  And I'm done.
[9601.65s -> 9602.65s]  I'm going to be ready this time.
[9602.65s -> 9606.26s]  God damn it.
[9606.26s -> 9607.26s]  $200,000.
[9607.26s -> 9608.26s]  I didn't even...
[9608.26s -> 9609.26s]  I couldn't even get it.
[9609.26s -> 9617.22s]  Open the store.
[9617.22s -> 9618.22s]  End the...
[9618.22s -> 9619.22s]  Let's go.
[9619.22s -> 9620.22s]  We're going to...
[9620.22s -> 9621.22s]  I'm not going to change the past.
[9621.22s -> 9628.96s]  Go back a few days?
[9628.96s -> 9630.78s]  Buy stuff?
[9630.78s -> 9631.78s]  Buy...
[9631.78s -> 9641.79s]  But that's cheating.
[9641.79s -> 9642.79s]  Who cares if it's cheating?
[9642.79s -> 9643.79s]  You want a bracelet?
[9643.79s -> 9645.60s]  Hold on.
[9645.60s -> 9648.91s]  I don't have any bracelets.
[9648.91s -> 9653.64s]  Am I above cheating?
[9653.64s -> 9657.78s]  I'll buy a few things, okay?
[9657.78s -> 9662.56s]  Watch me actually do it this time, somehow.
[9662.56s -> 9675.14s]  The interest rates on these loans are cheating.
[9675.14s -> 9676.14s]  Yeah, that's true.
[9676.14s -> 9684.74s]  I will buy...
[9684.74s -> 9685.74s]  How about this?
[9685.74s -> 9686.74s]  I'm going to go buy the most expensive weapons.
[9686.74s -> 9692.31s]  Oh, your mom told you to come sell this.
[9692.31s -> 9693.31s]  No, thanks.
[9693.31s -> 9696.76s]  Yeah, that is tactical gaming.
[9696.76s -> 9697.76s]  You're right.
[9697.76s -> 9714.75s]  Get out of here.
[9714.75s -> 9722.38s]  The game's designed to kick this shit out of you in your first run.
[9722.38s -> 9724.38s]  You're supposed to optimize for the second run.
[9724.38s -> 9725.38s]  Okay.
[9725.38s -> 9726.38s]  Okay.
[9726.38s -> 9729.58s]  The price of weapons has decreased.
[9729.58s -> 9730.58s]  And look at that, guys.
[9730.58s -> 9733.58s]  I waited a day and I'm going to nail it now.

[12280.72s -> 12290.16s]  off i say that all the fucking time you know kim will will be able to tell you a story of how
[12291.04s -> 12295.84s]  um i think i've already told this story but sometimes i just get on something i just don't
[12295.84s -> 12303.52s]  get off after we watched infinity war i was just doing Thanos quotes alone i was making like
[12303.52s -> 12308.16s]  sandwiches and just be just would just talk as Thanos and say the same like four lines over and
[12308.16s -> 12325.16s]  over again i would just do it i don't know why because it just i i don't know it's just something
[12325.16s -> 12331.56s]  that i do sometimes but the reason why i bring this up is because i i've said that on stream so
[12331.56s -> 12337.56s]  many times you could probably make like a four or five minute video compilation of me doing
[12338.52s -> 12353.85s]  that game of thrones guy you probably could i've said it so many times
[12362.60s -> 12365.32s]  look what i'm doing it again

[17385.31s -> 17386.19s]  take it so i can eat it
[17388.67s -> 17390.73s]  the pumpkins have a shitload of experience

[17406.60s -> 17423.23s]  it's a little time in the day attack power doubled for everybody that's bad
[17424.43s -> 17426.43s]  that means if i get hit like twice i die
[17433.07s -> 17442.68s]  i can't i don't that was off screen that's some off-screen bullshit all right this same
[17442.68s -> 17459.12s]  shit happened to me last time i'm not gonna let that happen again he's losing he's losing
[17459.12s -> 17470.80s]  it he's losing it no i'm good let me get to 14 what level is um

[17489.84s -> 17495.79s]  didn't get hit by it just eat the bread
[17495.79s -> 17514.04s]  70 damage that's pretty good uh i think i can get to 13 14 on the same floor

[17564.99s -> 17570.11s]  probably gonna see a boss uh do i just go down i wonder if i should just try to fight the boss
[17570.11s -> 17578.64s]  with the items that i have yeah this is gonna be hell was this a cube eternal ice i don't want
[17578.64s -> 17593.10s]  to lose that that seems like a really good item i just got like the tesseract i don't think i'm
[17593.10s -> 17610.57s]  gonna lose it although i probably might i might be able to get to 15
[17611.76s -> 17622.08s]  it's very i don't know it might not be worth the risk i'll try everything takes forever to kill
[17625.60s -> 17628.08s]  i don't think that means more experience that just means harder to kill
[17628.08s -> 17639.82s]  okay
[17645.18s -> 17664.83s]  nice oh all right not bad i think i'm just gonna go

[17671.40s -> 17674.20s]  i want to deal with the defense shit after these guys i'm gonna go through
[17675.32s -> 17684.76s]  let's see what it is uh no no no no no no no no get get the that's what i'm here for i'm here

[19744.64s -> 19751.31s]  the fountain attempting to sell overpriced items like what paintings and other objects
[19751.31s -> 19756.75s]  to art with hard to define value seemingly even then though the offer prices were apparently
[19756.75s -> 19762.59s]  absurd let there be a lesson always try to keep our prices realistic or people who begin to spread
[19762.59s -> 19767.95s]  rumors about us yeah art's tough to sell though indeed we should always be careful in stocking
[19767.95s -> 19776.86s]  paintings and the like new character hey you there uh can we help you you two look like you

[19805.40s -> 19811.45s]  something you'll just adore i don't know i don't know what's the asking price for one of these

[20137.92s -> 20141.74s]  this ain't a speed run this is a regular run
[20150.44s -> 20164.65s]  i want to try to get to 16 games done normally that's right
[20173.31s -> 20174.67s]  games done at your leisure

[20265.61s -> 20275.64s]  i'm fine just get me out of here 12
[20275.64s -> 20285.50s]  oh you can wrap that around them that's pretty cool a big swing radius
[20296.62s -> 20300.38s]  chat is so predictable are they what do they say i'm not looking at it right now
[20310.92s -> 20312.04s]  turn the lookout oh no
[20312.04s -> 20325.71s]  well that's a like ten thousand dollars right there
[20328.75s -> 20329.95s]  he's wearing earpods
[20338.56s -> 20352.59s]  that really is that i don't think that level would not be funny ow what's this water crystal

[20371.98s -> 20374.62s]  oh parade helm all right this is worth money
[20382.83s -> 20389.77s]  17 almost what's that i can work with it
[20389.77s -> 20402.20s]  the exp sound is driving me insane this is kind of grating isn't it
[20407.00s -> 20408.84s]  what is hitting me what the hell was that
[20421.31s -> 20423.63s]  so is there i'm gonna assume this probably only 15
[20434.80s -> 20440.94s]  total whoa that's what happens when you look at chat glad i only took
[20442.70s -> 20449.15s]  a small amount of damage because that would have been bad trying to go too fast i have a lot of
[20449.15s -> 20453.63s]  confidence right now which is bad you never want to feel confident in a game like this you always
[20453.63s -> 20460.09s]  want to be nervous fighting your nails and scared up around every single corner
[20464.49s -> 20475.69s]  fish cookie it'll be funny if he walked off the edge ha ha i would donate two thousand bits
[20475.69s -> 20484.33s]  you can't even walk off the edge i'm stuck here you can't walk off the edge it doesn't work like
[20484.33s -> 20497.55s]  that
[20507.04s -> 20510.94s]  what time is it right now we're getting to those late hours aren't we

[20546.14s -> 20548.70s]  i know i'm about to level up but i'm scared to get like double tap and die
[20558.43s -> 20560.33s]  i'll forget it
[20563.58s -> 20565.58s]  i'm gonna hydrate and eat i've already eaten tonight
[20565.98s -> 20571.26s]  so right before the stream started i ate a full meal so i'll be good for a little while
[20571.26s -> 20585.56s]  i'll be good for like another few hours
[20587.08s -> 20591.80s]  pretty good i'm just gonna go i'll try to get to the boss
[20595.69s -> 20596.41s]  that's the next floor

[20606.56s -> 20613.77s]  if i can progress that part of the game

[20649.68s -> 20652.84s]  i can probably get to 19 before fighting the boss
[20665.00s -> 20669.90s]  he's so addicted well yeah come on
[20671.90s -> 20678.44s]  it was last time i was addicted to a game and i wanted to do it for like more than a couple
[20678.44s -> 20692.60s]  streams
[20700.25s -> 20712.94s]  don't let him play animal crossing yeah but that's just as fun i am a sucker for games with
[20713.66s -> 20722.73s]  just slow drip trickling upgrades that's just does it doesn't fool me the gauntlet nobody here

[20868.97s -> 20875.45s]  no no i don't need the bat wings i don't know i don't need them but they might be worth more
[20875.45s -> 20881.16s]  than this shit that i have okay like a piece of candy is not worth it rusty dagger just throw it

[21307.53s -> 21324.99s]  specific tell him the durian no someone will buy that durian you weren't here the day i came to

[21386.72s -> 21414.28s]  12 000 price gouger combo come on 15 almost there one more sale run an errand
[21416.12s -> 21428.01s]  110 what do i get at 15 the vending machine do you have my food stuffs
[21428.65s -> 21438.76s]  i do welcome back let me get rid of these peach tins that i bought too many of during the boom
[21439.56s -> 21454.89s]  i'm 26 you'll do it nice all right now let's put the vending machine in a moment if you will
[21455.69s -> 21460.75s]  no quite well i simply thought it was time to explain how to place and use vending machines
[21461.71s -> 21466.41s]  vending machines allow you to sell a larger volume of items in a shorter amount of time
[21466.41s -> 21473.52s]  compared to handling each customer yourself okay to place a vending machine choose the vending
[21473.52s -> 21478.72s]  machine from the item placement menu at the counter as if it were a normal item the counter
[21478.72s -> 21485.00s]  will become that vending machine and after i put it down it just starts selling stuff
[21487.82s -> 21491.34s]  no you'll have to keep the machine stocked yourself there is a limit to how much you can
[21491.34s -> 21498.64s]  place in a vending machine as well so be mindful of what you put inside okay there's a downside
[21498.64s -> 21503.36s]  however because the vending machine is automatic the price of an item sold from a vending machine
[21503.36s -> 21514.44s]  can not be negotiated items will sell for their base price keep that in mind all right it is a
[21514.44s -> 21520.89s]  drawback the extra volume can often make up for the lower price however so far cheap items a
[21520.89s -> 21529.53s]  vending machine is helpful i'm just gonna get like four of them finally remember that we cannot sell
[21529.53s -> 21534.33s]  off the machines ourselves if you wish to dispose of a machine we must sell it back to the merchant
[21534.33s -> 21542.99s]  skilled or market at a steep loss keep that in mind if you decide to invest in one all right
[21542.99s -> 21549.36s]  well let's get it over here what should i put in it i think i think i want it like right here right
[21549.36s -> 21567.88s]  in the front door right there or right here right at the end i think right in the front door peach
[21567.88s -> 21582.78s]  tins yams uh i think i could probably just stock up on peach tin i'm gonna put it right here
[21584.14s -> 21612.89s]  where is it old vendor whoa it's the whole thing what uh okay is it two this is like the apple
[21612.89s -> 21628.17s]  machine and like chocolate and fish do cheap stuff cheap shit well what if it just automatically
[21628.17s -> 21643.29s]  sells these for me i think that's worth it for me peach tins won't sell in there what about like
[21643.29s -> 21656.84s]  raincoats this is for getting rid of just cheap shit all right well i don't really have that much
[21656.84s -> 21667.55s]  cheap shit i mean unthankful statue i got like slime fluids i got a bunch of shitty slime
[21670.92s -> 21689.61s]  and anti-venom toothpicks all right it's a toothpick machine this is dumb done stocking
[21690.17s -> 21713.71s]  who the hell is gonna buy that shit let's get i want to keep pure edge oh there's no booming
[21713.71s -> 21729.69s]  markets right now so yeah there's no booming markets markets are boring today i have so many

[22778.24s -> 22782.32s]  actually pretty popular so many people have speculated that the coup was orchestrated by
[22782.32s -> 22789.21s]  a rival kingdom and out the people now here's where it gets interesting that king had a daughter and
[22789.21s -> 22793.93s]  after the coup she just disappeared the nobility of that realm are searching for her in order to
[22793.93s -> 22798.89s]  raise her up as their new queen and seize control again it's me they're quite desperate that kingdom's
[22798.89s -> 22805.44s]  troubles are just starting mark my words is that so you really aren't interested in this at all are

[22836.19s -> 22840.59s]  in the long run therefore the best merchants make it to their job they get the job to gather from
[22840.59s -> 22845.39s]  across the news in the world they go to all the reddits every one of them they go to reddit news
[22845.39s -> 22852.65s]  they go to reddit interesting gifts they go to reddit earth they go to they get they get their

[24144.19s -> 24148.84s]  and then in the two day yeah this is going well i'm so happy about this

[24186.88s -> 24199.71s]  welcome to oh great good day you seem to be longing about as usual well that's not true
[24199.71s -> 24206.19s]  i'm really very very busy even if i do have my feet up on the counter right putting that aside
[24206.19s -> 24210.43s]  for a moment i assume you've heard about the recent issues concerning trade of items deemed
[24210.43s -> 24221.66s]  by the chapel masters to be magical typical i have heard about that the chapel masters have
[24221.66s -> 24225.98s]  been seizing items that they claim have a corrupting influence on man's immortal soul
[24226.70s -> 24234.97s]  i believe the claim was yeah spot on just that i'd expect to view madame fairy hey anyway it's all
[24234.97s -> 24241.95s]  a super bad califragilisticexpialidocious nonsense interestingly though the items that
[24241.95s -> 24246.27s]  the chapel gathers for a destruction a lot of them are turning up in the dungeons and i mean
[24246.27s -> 24256.17s]  a lot well why very good question the dungeons have always been packed with mysterious
[24257.21s -> 24263.23s]  mysteries however so it may not be worth thinking about too hard it does however present an
[24263.23s -> 24271.53s]  opportunity which leads me to a guild card oh you want us to give the items back to the chapel
[24271.53s -> 24281.37s]  masters how can you be so dense and still be capable of breathing dense uh like a chocolate
[24281.37s -> 24287.21s]  cake i want to make sure that these items return to general circulation the chapel masters are
[24287.21s -> 24292.89s]  standing astride curiosity and knowledge and i won't have it if you help me you can recover
[24292.89s -> 24299.95s]  some of these to sell while i lay hands on other things for study the chapel masters won't try to
[24299.95s -> 24307.63s]  seize property from a spec to a secular shop so you would have nothing to worry about of course
[24307.71s -> 24311.71s]  the merchants guild is a jurisdiction over the behavior of the city's merchants
[24311.71s -> 24320.00s]  and the guild master would never cede authority to anyone so so they can't touch us aren't city
[24320.00s -> 24326.60s]  politics wonderfully headache-inducing regardless madame fairy you provide the material support i
[24326.60s -> 24332.44s]  provide the quite literal firepower we go into a dungeon together and get what we need agreed
[24333.56s -> 24337.72s]  well we'll pay the adventure fee for sure but you'll have to buy what we find here
[24337.72s -> 24347.10s]  in the shop just like everybody else oh man you gotta be uh well yeah that's acceptable
[24347.74s -> 24350.86s]  i'm looking forward to seeing you in action i expect a lot mr magician
[24352.06s -> 24360.09s]  you hardly need to worry on that front miss counter jockey make sure you can identify everything
[24360.09s -> 24373.40s]  is fine okay this chat is a mess why i'd like a weapon oh would you like a weapon i got one for
[24373.40s -> 24382.11s]  you and it's the one that i want you to have so badly do you have the cash to give me this

[30370.20s -> 30379.50s]  a little slow but it's all right this is a lot different than just putting numbers in a window

[30656.56s -> 30669.82s]  don't nothing come on all right now i just need to level up
[30670.76s -> 30687.61s]  all right i i'm not gonna lie i just like hard blinked three times i can't give up i'm almost
[30687.61s -> 30700.19s]  there oh don't kill me please i always got a million dollars i just gotta spend the million
[30702.86s -> 30707.02s]  all right now this is where i'm gonna level up
[30722.17s -> 30741.20s]  yeah oh i'll take it 25 i'll be level 25 at floor 25
[30755.66s -> 30766.68s]  almost 23 24
[30766.68s -> 30769.56s]  or
[30771.40s -> 30772.36s]  i thought that was a ham
[30776.52s -> 30777.24s]  well i leveled up
[30781.56s -> 30791.34s]  now run eight and a half hours and we're still fine this ain't even close to my like all-time
[30791.34s -> 30800.88s]  high stream got a long way to go my longest stream was like 13 hours or something this is like eight
[30800.88s -> 30821.53s]  and a half yeah now typically i sit somewhere between like six and seven and a half not today
[30831.32s -> 30833.00s]  simpson's hitting around that was it wasn't that 11
[30835.64s -> 30840.76s]  how long was simpson hit was it was that actually i thought it was that um lifeline game
[30841.56s -> 30844.60s]  so
[30848.52s -> 30888.54s]  stop floors are so huge look at how big this is this is massive this is so big break the record i
[30888.54s -> 30896.08s]  don't think i would even if i did i'm gonna do i'm gonna beat the debt even if i did that that i'm
[30896.08s -> 30902.81s]  assuming like another probably 45 minutes to an hour we're not gonna come even close to the record
[30903.45s -> 30919.50s]  here we go i think i'm gonna try to level up one more time here
[30924.35s -> 30929.04s]  probably worth it considering this is probably one of the last boss areas
[30930.72s -> 30938.52s]  for the death storyline i could be wrong i'm not even gonna attack the fire guys just guaranteed
[30938.52s -> 30942.28s]  death
[30947.50s -> 30952.30s]  oh what's this cutlet bowl i love chicken cutlets
[30954.46s -> 30957.42s]  they knew there's like my favorite food on earth and they're just taunting me with it now
[30957.42s -> 30974.09s]  i like cold chicken cutlets
[30976.17s -> 30977.93s]  i'm not even i don't think that's even a weird thing to say
[30986.33s -> 30989.53s]  cooked um you cook them you bread them you cook them you fry them up
[30990.25s -> 30994.97s]  and then you put them in the fridge and eat them cold like a sandwich
[30995.93s -> 31002.97s]  a little bit of mayonnaise a little bit of uh like swiss cheese maybe and i knew i didn't
[31002.97s -> 31007.52s]  want to touch any chest and this is the number one reason why this is the reason you're looking at
[31007.52s -> 31026.32s]  right now that's why i didn't want to even touch one what am i gonna eat my options are gonna be
[31026.32s -> 31043.05s]  pretty limited in like an hour or so no fire guys right all right just kill the pumpkin and
[31043.05s -> 31052.25s]  i can level up level up all right this is it i need to pay attention here because
[31054.33s -> 31061.76s]  i'm only gonna get one shot at this so this is it for the night two fire guys just avoid them
[31062.72s -> 31071.34s]  what if it blocks is in here this is the last shot until i've erased the debt
[31078.73s -> 31102.22s]  uh too much go around of course all right here we go it's double slime double slime
[31102.38s -> 31111.44s]  so

[35211.96s -> 35218.48s]  quite a bit has happened despite the short amount of time i'll say i never thought i'd have to open
[35218.48s -> 35225.82s]  an item shop to help pay off one of my papa's bad loans when i arrived here i expected no i
[35225.82s -> 35231.34s]  deserved nothing but your scorn and hatred and you always trusted me from the day we met to
[35231.34s -> 35237.42s]  this very moment without questioning me once i do not understand it even now how are you capable
[35237.42s -> 35247.28s]  of such casual trust how can you be so ceaselessly positive about things um well um i don't know i
[35247.28s -> 35251.60s]  really understand i don't know anything but to tell you the truth when you told me that i had
[35251.60s -> 35255.76s]  to open an item store to pay off the debt all i could think was that sounds like a lot of fun
[35256.48s -> 35260.48s]  i met people i never could have dreamed of meeting when i was alone i got to run a shop i wanted
[35260.48s -> 35264.48s]  adventures i got to experience everything i never thought i'd see it was an exciting just
[35265.04s -> 35270.64s]  waking up in the morning wondering what happened more important than anything i got to meet you
[35271.44s -> 35280.86s]  tear i'm happier about that than i am about anything else you say such embarrassing things

[35687.72s -> 35702.06s]  mind you let's go back oh my god and so our days of running an item shop continue
[35709.45s -> 35715.84s]  oh i got the true card what that we're out what are we doing so you managed to pay off the loan
[35715.84s -> 35722.40s]  shark fairies debt have you well i suppose some congratulations are in order still i would expect
[35722.40s -> 35730.09s]  any common proletarian to have the holy basic skills needed to get this far and now for part
[35730.17s -> 35739.45s]  two the elegant graceful tale of alouette yeah like egs is interested in making that happen
[35741.12s -> 35744.80s]  what did you just say calm down they say you don't need to get this worked up over it more
[35744.80s -> 35751.77s]  importantly please just do the explanation right here's this one i don't see why of all the people
[35751.77s -> 35759.07s]  have to look here misters fine fine fine if i must okay well then without further ado allow me to
[35759.07s -> 35766.91s]  explain post game content or enjoying the game after beating it all right that's better to start
[35766.91s -> 35771.63s]  with if you load the game you're about to save you will begin endless mode where you can play
[35771.63s -> 35778.03s]  as long as you like without having to worry about any debts you may work as a common shopkeeper to
[35778.03s -> 35784.28s]  your heart's delight and you know there just might maybe possibly be some items and dungeons
[35784.28s -> 35789.00s]  and stuff that you haven't seen before in addition you have now unlocked new game plus and the
[35789.00s -> 35793.96s]  survival mode you start over again a new game plus but you choose a save and keep all the items
[35793.96s -> 35798.43s]  and levels from that save remember that you've got to pay off the debt from the beginning again
[35798.43s -> 35803.31s]  though survival mode is a nasty business where you keep paying back debt every single week until
[35803.31s -> 35810.19s]  it overwhelms you how long can you last against weeks of six digit payments i wonder especially
[35810.19s -> 35815.71s]  in that ridiculous survival hell mode you might have picked up a true card from an adventurer
[35816.35s -> 35820.35s]  you only get that from an adventurer you're really close to but if you have that you can hire them
[35820.35s -> 35827.61s]  from the start in these new modes anyway that should about do it really a proper player won't
[35827.61s -> 35832.33s]  be satisfied beating the game just once at the very least aim to fill out the entire item encyclopedia
[35833.45s -> 35845.36s]  pardon me see you guys enjoy the rest of the game okay let's go let's just make a new save
[35850.52s -> 35882.86s]  save okay how many do overwrite no how do i get out of this i made it okay well that's a lot
[35882.86s -> 35889.02s]  let me see items encyclopedia cool i got all swords all the daggers all the staves all the bows
