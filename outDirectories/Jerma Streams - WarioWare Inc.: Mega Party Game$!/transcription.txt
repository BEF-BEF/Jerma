[0.76s -> 7.00s]  Good afternoon. Hi, welcome back. Sorry, yesterday, but welcome.
[7.00s -> 17.77s]  Okay, good to see you again. Oh, MonkaS clown detected.
[17.77s -> 24.89s]  Today, we are going to play WarioWare for the Nintendo GameCube.
[24.89s -> 29.61s]  And you're probably wondering, Jeremy, you said that we're probably gonna be playing Casino Inc. today.
[30.89s -> 34.41s]  And I wouldn't even be saying that. That was last night Jeremy saying that.
[34.41s -> 35.21s]  It's a different person.
[36.68s -> 41.59s]  So, the reason is because I think that game's gonna take more than a few streams,
[41.59s -> 44.55s]  or maybe like more than one to two full streams to do.
[45.80s -> 49.53s]  And I'm not gonna be around tomorrow, or the next day, or the next day.
[50.47s -> 55.99s]  Over the next four plus days, I've got a lot of stuff going on in my personal life.
[55.99s -> 64.57s]  Those of you that don't know, I am moving, staying in Vegas, but moving over the next week or two.
[64.57s -> 71.42s]  And gotta get a lot of shit done. Gotta get a lot of stuff in order,
[71.42s -> 75.67s]  especially considering the circumstances as of right now.
[75.75s -> 80.78s]  All the stuff with the coronavirus. I gotta get my shit together.
[80.78s -> 90.78s]  So, he's moving to Vegas. That's right, I am.
[90.78s -> 95.93s]  But, so I didn't want to start Casino Inc. because I want to give it at least the necessary time,
[95.93s -> 98.49s]  because it looks like a really, really fun, interesting game.
[98.49s -> 105.43s]  So, I was like, what can we do today for a little while over the next X amount of hours?
[105.43s -> 109.75s]  And well, WarioWare is one of them. And obviously, Animal Crossing as well.
[109.75s -> 113.27s]  So, the plan is we're gonna play WarioWare until we have eaten our full.
[113.27s -> 118.54s]  And then we're gonna move on to Animal Crossing because I want to play it again.
[118.54s -> 123.26s]  We're on first party Nintendo mode today and yesterday.
[123.26s -> 132.42s]  Las Vegas, here we come. That's the plan.
[132.42s -> 142.44s]  He's gonna be demonetized. Where are you moving to?
[142.44s -> 153.10s]  Las Vegas. Staying in Las Vegas. Just a different place.
[153.10s -> 167.99s]  Yeah, but where? Oh, well, you guys have. You guys have.
[167.99s -> 171.53s]  Fuck. Anyways, let's play.
[171.53s -> 175.45s]  Let's play WarioWare. How many WarioWares are there?
[176.62s -> 179.34s]  How many games? This is the GameCube WarioWare, right?
[179.34s -> 184.01s]  Because they like renamed it. This is WarioWare Mega Party Games.
[184.81s -> 188.55s]  But the original game was called Mega Micro Games.
[188.55s -> 193.86s]  It was renamed or something for some reason. I don't know. It's weird.
[194.66s -> 200.90s]  But here you go. We have to do a test here because I don't know.
[202.02s -> 207.14s]  It looks like there is a full four or five second delay when this is coming through my capture device.
[207.86s -> 210.74s]  So we're going to do a test. I would like for you to all to participate in this test.
[211.70s -> 214.90s]  Are you ready? Because it might. I got to get this right before I play.
[216.87s -> 223.16s]  One. How off is that? I need to know. It's probably very off.
[225.72s -> 232.20s]  One, two, one, two. It's off by like, yeah, it's going to be off by like two full seconds.
[232.20s -> 237.24s]  When I move, let's say I hit left and I say, oh, I look over on my other screen.
[237.24s -> 239.16s]  It takes three or four full seconds to happen.
[239.80s -> 244.12s]  All right, here we go. Let's try this. Ready? Tell me how this sounds.
[247.05s -> 255.50s]  Do I actually have to delay my voice by two thousand milliseconds for this to work?
[255.50s -> 264.60s]  Holy shit. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Better?
[265.32s -> 274.30s]  Now that's too much. It's close. So I'm early.
[276.47s -> 283.69s]  So you hear my voice first, right? All right, here we go.
[283.69s -> 292.65s]  Time to go to twenty. I feel like I'm in the fucking like past.
[293.05s -> 300.15s]  I'm like I'm in like the future. One, two, one, two, one.
[303.16s -> 314.10s]  Hey, the video is early. How's this sound? Hey, what do you know about that?
[314.10s -> 322.95s]  What do you know? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[322.95s -> 326.86s]  I don't know. Nothing changed. It's worse.
[327.74s -> 331.58s]  Fuck. This whole thing is fucked up. I need to like hear this, but I can't.
[332.87s -> 361.72s]  All right, hold on. I was trying to get in my room. He was like, let me in.
[362.28s -> 370.33s]  OK, why is this such a huge delay? OK, here we go. Ready?
[372.52s -> 376.55s]  One. Two hours of fixing delay.
[376.55s -> 384.74s]  Why would it take like five full fucking seconds? It's close.
[385.90s -> 393.40s]  One, two, one, two. All right, what are you hearing?
[393.40s -> 398.92s]  Video first or audio first or me first? Voice is slightly early. OK, hold on.
[399.56s -> 403.83s]  I'll get it. This is this is this is it. This is the one you're at.
[410.52s -> 420.17s]  Hey, are you ready to go? Are you ready?
[421.58s -> 429.06s]  One, two, three, one. Now the game's further behind.
[429.06s -> 433.08s]  Now this is making me. No, that's way too much.
[436.15s -> 445.98s]  I just added so much more time. Hey, how are you?
[447.06s -> 462.25s]  Two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, four, five, five. Good. Yes.
[464.65s -> 476.10s]  Who are you? I'm me. Oh, God. It's not good. Should I do it a little more?
[476.10s -> 477.94s]  You tell me. Ready? I'll do the whole alphabet.
[479.05s -> 488.33s]  A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P.
[489.29s -> 499.56s]  It's good. OK, I stopped right at the far at the point everybody wanted me to do.
[506.06s -> 521.34s]  All right, P, Q, R, S. That's fine. All right, here we go.
[522.15s -> 524.95s]  Stage clear games. Beat all other games.
[525.59s -> 535.02s]  Why is it a Game Boy Advance up there? You owe us a QRS.
[540.09s -> 549.38s]  No, I'm not going to do it. Grab. How do I grab?
[550.84s -> 553.64s]  Well, I don't know. What do you mean? I just got that wrong.
[557.40s -> 562.84s]  Oh, OK. All right. All right. Where's the fucking storyline?
[562.84s -> 567.66s]  Isn't there like a storyline? Oh, this is the first one.
[569.16s -> 573.91s]  God. All right. You got it. The screen is cut off.
[574.55s -> 579.66s]  Wait, why is the screen cut off? This is fucked up.
[581.94s -> 585.53s]  That's happening to me, too. That's not just happening to you guys.
[585.53s -> 592.90s]  That's happening to me. Hold on. Yeah, that's happening to me, too.
[604.23s -> 606.31s]  Should have done the QRS. Oh, fuck. I got it.
[611.48s -> 616.28s]  Got it. How many of these do I have to do? Is there a boss?
[620.07s -> 621.51s]  Oh, fuck. I could put clothes on. I'm good.
[622.23s -> 643.91s]  That's what I look like right now. Oh, bar. Oh, shit.
[643.91s -> 646.39s]  OK, it swings all the way. How do I? OK, I got it.
[647.03s -> 651.19s]  Is he playing party game? No, they renamed this game.
[651.19s -> 659.35s]  This is the original one for the GameCube. All right, I got the one up. Let's go.
[659.99s -> 663.32s]  This is a face game game. Do I really have to go put on clothes?
[665.59s -> 685.21s]  What? Fuck, I'm going to lose. Should have clothes on.
[685.21s -> 688.25s]  No, I don't have to put on clothes. I don't have to wear clothes if I don't want to.
[688.25s -> 692.55s]  Easy. Done. I'm in my own room. I'm in my own house.
[696.90s -> 704.04s]  I'm not in your house. I'm in my house. Oh, fuck, I lost.
[704.68s -> 708.87s]  Do I actually have to? All right. How about this?
[708.87s -> 721.72s]  This is not my beautiful house. Holy fuck, there's a lot.
[722.36s -> 731.88s]  Wait, wait. Intro. Wait, it's supposed to be zoomed in.
[731.88s -> 735.64s]  Oh, all right. I get it. So, yeah, the game's not cut off.
[735.64s -> 744.62s]  It's supposed to look like this. I had everything was correct.
[744.62s -> 758.71s]  Now I have to redo that. I need to go get on naked.
[758.71s -> 762.07s]  All right, I promise I'll put a face cam on in like 40 minutes.
[762.07s -> 773.30s]  I can't. This is just an intro. There's a story. All right, speed up.
[776.78s -> 788.04s]  Fuck. Okay. Excellent. Hello, his voice.
[788.68s -> 794.39s]  He's going to turn into a clickbait face cam streamer.
[806.15s -> 809.51s]  Jeremy, you should get a mustache. You want me to get a fucking mustache?
[811.78s -> 815.46s]  No. You think you get like serial killer vibes from me now?
[816.10s -> 819.14s]  If I grow a mustache, I increase that by like 50%.
[828.47s -> 831.11s]  You don't have to look at fucking reddit threads and I get to see like,
[831.11s -> 832.71s]  all right, is this guy like a serial killer?
[833.51s -> 838.70s]  Now imagine me with a huge ass mustache instead of is this guy a serial killer?
[838.70s -> 841.02s]  It turns into this guy's a serial killer.
[844.81s -> 847.93s]  Balance. Oh, shit. Okay, I got it. Got the pieces.
[847.93s -> 856.70s]  Curl. What? Oh, shit. Damn it. I didn't understand what it meant.
[857.34s -> 868.98s]  Spike the ball. Jump. Oh, I love this character. Look at that guy.
[872.34s -> 889.42s]  Swim. What? Did I get it? Shoot. Yes. Got it.
[892.31s -> 895.03s]  The audio is bad. I'll try. I'll fix it in a minute.
[895.03s -> 901.94s]  This is for some reason this game in particular is like so fucked up when it got captured.
[902.26s -> 904.10s]  And I was trying to figure it out, but I couldn't figure it out.
[904.10s -> 912.95s]  Jump. Oh, fuck. I got a jumping. Did I get it?
[916.81s -> 919.05s]  Oh, fuck. I have to press up. Shit. All right.
[926.82s -> 930.49s]  Shoot. Shoot what? Oh, my God. I got it.
[934.17s -> 938.73s]  No. Fuck. I thought I was moving me. I thought I was moving the guy, not the trampoline.
[938.73s -> 940.57s]  Shit. All right. I'll put on clothes. I'll be back.
[1067.64s -> 1071.72s]  You know what's funny? Me turning on my face cam just made syncing this whole thing up
[1072.28s -> 1076.28s]  exponentially more difficult because now I have to sync the webcam too.
[1080.25s -> 1083.69s]  There's like three different things that need to be delayed. This is going to be,
[1083.69s -> 1088.76s]  well, this is going to be, well, we're here for a while. All right. If I turn the webcam on,
[1088.76s -> 1091.88s]  you're not going to see like a naked body, right? Because sometimes this fucking camera
[1091.88s -> 1097.16s]  takes the frame, the last frame that it saw, and it might be my naked body.
[1097.16s -> 1103.82s]  So I need to make sure that's not going to happen. Okay. I think we're good.
[1103.82s -> 1116.15s]  Let me make sure this is right. Nope. See what I mean? You see what I'm saying?
[1116.15s -> 1119.91s]  Did you see that? Like that, that could have been a naked person.
[1120.55s -> 1132.82s]  Are you guys ready for a like, look, I get it. Look, it's so weird. This is so delayed.
[1132.82s -> 1138.49s]  This is such a joke. I can't even monitor what I'm doing. I'm pointing and talking at you,
[1138.49s -> 1141.77s]  but the guy over here is doing the same thing like three seconds later.
[1143.40s -> 1149.75s]  It's fucking freaking me out. Okay. You ready? Here we go. Let's test it.
[1150.31s -> 1156.97s]  I need my audio. Holy shit. Look at, look at how many different
[1156.97s -> 1159.13s]  fucking mini game levels there are. This is going to be sick.
[1159.93s -> 1166.30s]  All right. Where's my fucking audio device? Half screen face cam. Well, it has to be that
[1166.30s -> 1172.36s]  so we can get this synced up. I got another thing to sync. Welcome to the sync stream.
[1173.32s -> 1184.68s]  Okay. Here we go. How bad was that? Why is his jacket zipped up all the way?
[1184.68s -> 1188.52s]  Well, I don't know. I wonder why is this jacket zipped up all the way?
[1188.52s -> 1191.56s]  It doesn't have anything to do with the fact that there's nothing else underneath this.
[1193.00s -> 1196.60s]  And I put it on out of desperation because there's nothing fucking, there's nothing under here.
[1199.72s -> 1210.52s]  It's just nudity under this zip up. I'm not going to stand up. I'm not standing up.
[1210.52s -> 1217.35s]  All right. We have a very specific task to do. Are you ready? I have to go back.
[1218.71s -> 1223.19s]  So when the door opens, I'm going to move myself over here.
[1225.38s -> 1237.21s]  Let's get this open. This is going to be so fucked up. Oh, fuck. I messed it up. Hold on.
[1237.21s -> 1245.61s]  Wait, this is going to help. Holy shit. This is going to help. I can see it over here. I
[1245.61s -> 1252.52s]  can see it like five seconds. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Ready? Okay. It's going to be longer.
[1252.52s -> 1282.31s]  Longer. Ready? Check. This section is going to help. I can get this right. Hold on. Wait.
[1282.31s -> 1333.75s]  No, I didn't press the button. Fuck. Close. Oh, it's close. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Here we go.
[1333.75s -> 1356.10s]  Ready? Do you have the time, sir? Get the fuck out of here. Let's go. Let's go. We're good.
[1356.10s -> 1384.18s]  Wait, I have to fix the, nevermind. I just realized I just was fucking like pointing.
[1384.18s -> 1390.87s]  Holy shit. There's a lot of people here that just watched me do that. There's a lot of people that
[1390.87s -> 1397.53s]  just watched that happen. Like I would do that on my own. I tried, but it was, why is your forehead
[1397.53s -> 1417.99s]  shining? I don't know. Cause I have an oily T-zone. Here, here's your gold star. It's your T-zone.
[1418.95s -> 1442.30s]  God. Here's that. Just take a shower. It doesn't, that's a plastic surgeon terminology. No,
[1442.30s -> 1448.74s]  it's a skincare terminology. Well, that's like, that's, that's what that is called.
[1449.70s -> 1455.69s]  Okay. And that's how you can tell. And those of you, you saw it in real time. You saw it in real time.
[1455.69s -> 1460.86s]  You watched it in real time. You watched me look at another monitor. So there was five community subs
[1460.86s -> 1465.26s]  came in and I looked over at the other monitor and there we go. I fell down and I got fucking hurt.
[1465.26s -> 1469.70s]  Saw it in real time. So those of you that just like, that asked the question all the time,
[1469.70s -> 1472.66s]  what the fuck did he miss that? It's because somebody, I just looked over here because
[1472.66s -> 1476.26s]  something happened over here. I looked over here. I was looking over there. I was looking over here.
[1477.66s -> 1483.34s]  See something. I should do face cave every day. Uh, germa sucks. Thanks to the five community subs.
[1483.34s -> 1511.69s]  All right, I'll get it here. God gave you two eyes for a reason.
[1512.92s -> 1516.68s]  What are you, are you implying that I need to frog eyes both monitors?
[1520.95s -> 1539.16s]  All right, here we go. Let's go. Jimmy T. Holy fuck. How do you defend? Got it. Catch. I don't
[1539.16s -> 1550.02s]  know. Okay. You can just like this. Got it. Hurdle. Just jump. Whoa. That was a lot quicker
[1550.02s -> 1570.12s]  than I thought it was going to be. Balance. Swim. Did I get it? Yeah. Jump. I love these fucking
[1570.12s -> 1585.05s]  micro games. Here comes QRS. I'll get this one this time. Bounce. Right. I'm not moving him.
[1585.05s -> 1587.93s]  I'm moving the trampoline. Got it. That's what the, that's where the hiccup was last time.
[1588.73s -> 1616.71s]  Good. Yeah. What are you talking about? I pressed A. Dead. Oh, fuck. Got it. Nice. All right. I only
[1616.71s -> 1637.53s]  have two lives. I don't want to fuck this up. Speed up. But got it. Ooh, got it. Got it. Got it.
[1653.66s -> 1679.22s]  Got it. Loser. Whoa, that's close. I almost didn't get it. All right. Finish. Got it. Welcome to the
[1679.22s -> 1683.78s]  commentary of this game. I have to pay attention so much that all I can say is what happened at
[1683.78s -> 1714.25s]  the end. Knockout. Get him. I did. I beat it. Chill, baby. Chill. Got it. Do we keep, do we keep
[1714.25s -> 1731.53s]  going? Sci-fi. Dribble and splits. Wait, I just have to keep going. Land the jump. Holy shit.
[1733.26s -> 1739.48s]  Frost. Oh, fuck. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. Got it. I got it. I said it a lot of times
[1739.48s -> 1756.98s]  there. Assemble. Holy fuck. Okay. This game is more serious and more speedy. What do you mean blast
[1756.98s -> 1769.91s]  off? I just did. I held, I held the A button down. I think I actually dodged it somehow.
[1775.98s -> 1787.43s]  Side step. Got it. Dodge. Who's that? I thought it was shooting me. Wait, who's shooting who?
[1788.23s -> 1800.82s]  Who's shooting who? Didn't got it. Oh, I see. We go from, we start it. Okay. Sci-fi. Here we go.
[1800.82s -> 1809.35s]  Started sci-fi. This, this one's much quicker than the last one. Well, the future one, right?
[1810.15s -> 1819.93s]  Twitch plays WarioWare. Dude, rare minigames. I know. This is the one, this is not, I know it's
[1819.93s -> 1822.25s]  not the original one, but this is the one, this is the one that came out of the GameCube.
[1824.12s -> 1834.87s]  And I've heard great things. Pretty rare. I am not looking forward to when it gets to like
[1834.87s -> 1840.07s]  times 10 speed. That's going to be kind of all over the place. Beam. Oh, you have to do it. It's
[1840.07s -> 1855.27s]  actually like Street Fighter. That's fun. This one sucks. No story. This is just pure gameplay.
[1855.99s -> 1869.91s]  This one is just pure hyper gameplay. Repeat, repel, repel. I don't know what,
[1869.91s -> 1891.11s]  do I have to push him, punch him? Chop. Fuck. Where the hell is my 40 minute unskippable?
[1891.83s -> 1899.83s]  I'm not going to read that one out loud. This dude fucking sucks at this game.
[1899.83s -> 1925.10s]  Strike. Strike who? Get five. Got five. Hit Mars. Red one. Shoot? Okay. Cool. Cross. Oh,
[1925.10s -> 1939.13s]  that was close. It's four. Are you even actually doing anything? I did it. Yeah,
[1939.13s -> 1957.83s]  pressing, just sitting here watching. 22. Shit. Okay, we're good. Dodge. Escape.
[1958.92s -> 1978.25s]  Oh, got it. Got it. Complete what? Oh, yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. I'm super good at games
[1978.25s -> 1986.49s]  like this. That's why I got the spreader. You always want to get the spreader in these games.
[1987.13s -> 2011.64s]  Do I go in that? I don't understand what I do. Go in this? Oh, now that's a real penis music.
[2031.86s -> 2054.01s]  Got it. Off duty time. We have to keep going. Oh, no. Here comes Mona. Got you. Got you.
[2054.01s -> 2074.01s]  Got it. Got it. I don't understand. Twirl the spaghetti. Twirl the spaghetti. Oh,
[2081.13s -> 2087.61s]  that was, that was, that was stupid. Sorry. I'm going to start right there at strange.
[2088.17s -> 2107.82s]  Strange. No story. Can't play hands. He's so bad at video games. Steer. Oh, my God. I didn't even
[2107.82s -> 2127.83s]  know what the fuck. Mark page 10. Shine. Post. Got it. Squirt. I thought I was supposed to do it
[2127.83s -> 2140.78s]  in the mouth. I thought, I thought it was like food. Look out. All right. No, no more mistakes.
[2153.50s -> 2159.02s]  There's the, there it is. There's the, that's the Wario wear that I know.
[2163.27s -> 2176.39s]  God, I love micro gaming. Come on. What, was he not supposed to cut all his hair off?
[2182.78s -> 2202.28s]  Catch the toast. Deploy. I say, oh, I got it. Sniff. Okay. It's a bad parking job, but I,
[2202.28s -> 2240.66s]  but I still got it. Oh, that was close. Oh, you little fuck. He didn't like come up high
[2240.66s -> 2257.10s]  enough for me to grab him. All right. I'll get it. I'll, I'll get it. This is literally pre-recorded.
[2258.65s -> 2272.22s]  I mean, it technically is because I've pre-recorded the sound. Almost missed it.
[2273.21s -> 2289.54s]  You guys can see, right? When I'm like with my big ugly mug in the way. Speed up. That's what,
[2289.54s -> 2293.62s]  that was really easy. You just have to press A. Well, you just have to press A on all of these.
[2295.24s -> 2333.35s]  Got it. Got it. Ooh, did I do it? No, I got it. No, I got it. Got it. Got it. All right. I gotta
[2333.35s -> 2354.39s]  get this one now. Brush those fucking teeth. I got it. Okay. Got it. Fucking YouTube thumbnail
[2354.39s -> 2378.57s]  face. I didn't mean to. You're so good at this. Thanks. I appreciate that. You think so? I can't
[2378.65s -> 2383.16s]  say that now. I can't say that I did something. Like I can't say the word got it now because I've
[2383.16s -> 2397.98s]  said it too many times and I've recorded it too many times. You're good at parking. Oh my God.
[2397.98s -> 2403.42s]  I got it again. I was like dropping fucking flavor drops in that person's mouth. I don't know what
[2403.42s -> 2417.37s]  the fuck I'm doing. Pound? Watch out for the hand. Hit the nail. Hit the nail. Hit the nail,
[2417.37s -> 2432.44s]  Jeremy. Hit the nail. All right. Good. One up. Next game. Nine volt coming up.
[2437.27s -> 2446.23s]  Everyone can do that. It's just level one Mario. Throw? Oh, he's all the way in the back.
[2446.23s -> 2462.63s]  I didn't know. Vacuum. Shoot. That's a pretty cool gun. Oh, he didn't know. Dodge.
[2467.02s -> 2488.66s]  I should play that and beat it on screen. Punch. Nine volt. Connect. I don't know how to play
[2488.66s -> 2494.41s]  Dr. Mario. I've never played it. I don't know how the game even works. I have fucking no idea.
[2494.41s -> 2498.65s]  You know what I know about Dr. Mario? It's his side B as he throws a pill in Smash Brothers. I've
[2498.65s -> 2508.46s]  never played the game. I don't even know what happens. It's Candy Crush, but it's different.
[2509.74s -> 2517.51s]  That's his new way. That's not even right. That's incorrect. That's how much I know
[2518.55s -> 2537.78s]  about Mario Dr. Mario MD. Here we go. I love balloon fight. I don't know if you just want to
[2537.78s -> 2556.38s]  play Mario Brothers 1. Oops, sorry. It just told me to shoot. It didn't say to shoot. Enter.
[2556.38s -> 2601.66s]  Was it star drop? I have forever a sour face after that one. I love Game Boy. He looks so
[2601.66s -> 2613.80s]  ugly in that E mode. Guys, you want to do something? Sure. You know how easy it is to make yourself
[2613.80s -> 2620.60s]  look ugly? You go like this. Wait, hold on. That's looking where that is. That's bullshit.
[2626.38s -> 2632.31s]  It's very easy to make yourself ugly. This is what I normally look like. Like this. This is a
[2632.31s -> 2640.04s]  fucking normal person. If you scrunch your face up and press your lips into your jaw and pull your
[2640.04s -> 2645.99s]  nose back and close your eyes and scrunch your head, you can make yourself look ugly. Look at
[2645.99s -> 2658.06s]  all these emotes of me doing. Look, I'll show you. Ready? This is normal. Then see what happens to
[2658.06s -> 2708.86s]  my nose. I don't know how to play Dr. Mario. Did I do it? Is it four or is it? I just spoiled all
[2708.86s -> 2724.63s]  the Metroid. I'm not going to play it anymore. 6,500 people have watched you do that. I had a full
[2724.63s -> 2730.57s]  diaper of fucking slime. You think anything is going to embarrass me at this point? Think about
[2730.57s -> 2738.49s]  that. I was in a fucking diaper on stream with slime in my ass. You think that me making a face
[2738.49s -> 2748.06s]  on camera is going to make me embarrassed that 6,500 people saw that? At this point, it's over.
[2748.70s -> 2758.92s]  You were wearing clothes. Oh, what's this? Got it. Got it. What's the matter, Otto? What do you want?
[2758.92s -> 2774.79s]  What's going on? What's the matter? What are you doing? He's giving me the look. Got him. Oh,
[2774.79s -> 2787.86s]  okay. I get to tap it really fast. Pretty good Atari game. Joe Dog. Hold on. I'm in the middle
[2787.86s -> 2803.45s]  of a fucking micro game. Is that game good? That's F-Zero, right? Joe Dog for best of 2020.
[2806.39s -> 2820.07s]  Let me beat this first. Look out. Oh, it's Mr. Game and Watch. Game. Type two. Type one? What?
[2820.79s -> 2833.42s]  I don't understand. Shoot it. What the fuck? I don't even know. All right. Hold on.
[2838.39s -> 2843.54s]  What's the matter? What do you need? You want to go out? He wants to do something. Hold on.
[2845.27s -> 2877.80s]  Give me Otto. Yeah, he wants to go out. You want to say hi first, Otto? Say hello. Otto! He's like,
[2877.80s -> 2913.80s]  get me out of this room. All right. I'll be right back. Let me take him out. He's going to come.
[2913.80s -> 2935.14s]  Kim's going to take care of it. Joe Kim. Hey, everybody get in here. Everybody get in my room.
[2940.17s -> 2965.22s]  That one's just thick. Wait, I failed it? I thought it said don't. Wasn't it just don't get hit?
[2965.22s -> 2973.82s]  My face game is fucking huge. It's shrinking. That's way too big. That's so big. That's
[2973.82s -> 2990.34s]  obnoxiously huge. I got to kind of focus. Hello? Microscopic. Make it bigger. No.
[2991.14s -> 3067.03s]  Put the game in your mouth. Don't. The things I fucking do. Can you see? Can you guys see?
[3067.03s -> 3106.52s]  Can you guys? I can't. It's hard for me to do this. You shouldn't be able to still hear it.
[3106.52s -> 3127.72s]  That was fun. Oh, sorry. Sorry. I can't play the game like that. It's impossible.
[3127.72s -> 3153.93s]  That's physically not possible. Smaller. No. Am I bad at that? What, bad at pretending to
[3153.93s -> 3175.10s]  put the video game in my mouth and play micro games that are on another screen? Stop whining.
[3175.10s -> 3197.58s]  That's all I do. You look more naked with this jacket on. That doesn't make any fucking sense
[3197.58s -> 3202.70s]  at all. It's got clothes on. If I had a t-shirt on, you know, I'm naked under the t-shirt.
[3203.94s -> 3208.02s]  You know, with a t-shirt on, I'm naked under the t-shirt. This is just a shirt.
[3208.02s -> 3219.86s]  How am I more naked with this with this zip up on? He's blushing. All right, here we go. Speed up.
[3219.86s -> 3223.94s]  I'm going to beat this one now. I don't want any more people making fun of me,
[3224.50s -> 3247.19s]  but they're going to get the band. Shoot it. Just shoot any of them. All right. Shoot it.
[3250.57s -> 3259.51s]  So you admit you're naked. No, you got three lives. I'm going to, I'm going to knock this
[3259.51s -> 3292.54s]  one out of the park. I fucking don't like it. Speed up again. Damn. This is hard. Hit six.
[3296.31s -> 3330.36s]  Oh, it's body. Where the fuck did that even go? You can't say the F word on the internet. You
[3330.36s -> 3340.14s]  can't say the fuck word on the internet. Yes, I can. P Q R S. What? Oh, I beat it. I love this guy.
[3341.90s -> 3348.07s]  Match. Okay. That took me a little while. I didn't know what I wanted to be doing.
[3351.91s -> 3367.98s]  Shoes. I don't care. Who cares about pressing the button? Decide. Decide what? What am I deciding on?
[3369.02s -> 3393.86s]  What am I deciding on? That was cute. That was really cute. Oh, right. Because they spin.
[3393.86s -> 3403.51s]  I thought it was going to like just press A. Oh, you're going to, okay. You press them.
[3405.27s -> 3428.18s]  Search. What am I looking for? I got it right there. I just found them. Remember. Right down.
[3429.54s -> 3439.06s]  Hey, what the hell was going on there? Three. That's it. Just only three. Yeah. I got it. Yeah.
[3439.86s -> 3452.71s]  It's a three. Oh, fuck. The extra hand, the extra finger there. I was why it was like this.
[3453.59s -> 3456.63s]  And it was like that. And I just, I, you know what I'm saying? It was like that.
[3456.63s -> 3467.38s]  And I just picked them up with a three. I Q. I clicked before the thing got heavier. This one,
[3468.78s -> 3497.70s]  it's bigger turtles, right? Three picks four. I know. I don't like that one. Most wins.
[3498.58s -> 3513.35s]  What do you mean most wins? Oh, I see. Okay. Whoever has more. Choo. Are you hiding poop line?
[3513.35s -> 3518.15s]  Yes. It's in a cup. It's not see through because I've got sick and tired of people making fun of my
[3518.15s -> 3533.00s]  fucking shit line. There's a teddy bear. That's just a regular cup now. Dribble is. Dribble is.
[3538.63s -> 3544.09s]  Inspect. I don't know what the fuck it was. I think it was the guy's face.
[3545.05s -> 3571.32s]  Oh, I'm deciding which one doesn't belong. I get it. Dribble is Dribble. Dribble is Dribble.
[3580.65s -> 3593.45s]  Okay. You just have to Dribble is phrase search or what? I don't know. What the hell was that even
[3593.45s -> 3615.00s]  asking me to do? Or leap forward while holding a press. That's it. Okay. I did it right. Watch out.
[3615.00s -> 3619.00s]  Oh, I was trying to stay there. I held it down for too long. I was trying to stay in that spot.
[3619.72s -> 3626.95s]  Match. All right. It's got to flip. It can only be this one. Hey, I did it a little too far. I
[3626.95s -> 3670.49s]  Super Mario panic jumped. Like he went over there. Count. Oh, inspect it. Q. What the fuck are you
[3670.49s -> 3678.04s]  talking about? Right left. Right left. Right left. What the fuck? I did right left. I did right.
[3678.04s -> 3689.42s]  Right was wrong apparently. What the fuck happened? Right left. That's what I did. All right. It's an
[3689.42s -> 3727.59s]  apple or a tomato. Either one. What was wrong with that one? Okay. There was like small little ice
[3727.59s -> 3759.16s]  cubes in there and it's freaking me out. Three. Stop squishing him. He'll be fine. She still has
[3759.16s -> 3768.30s]  the microphone attachment on. Why didn't why would I take it off? What if I need it? It's a piece of
[3768.30s -> 3778.55s]  plastic that just clicks on right down. I got it. You guys act like it's just like surgically
[3778.55s -> 3795.83s]  implanted on here. Look, it's off. It was very difficult to take off. Dude, it only works with
[3795.83s -> 3811.10s]  five games. I know. What a catastrophic failure that a Repro was. Save him. I don't understand.
[3813.74s -> 3850.76s]  God. Is it orange? Yep. I can do shapes. Thankfully, that one's very easy. Ah,
[3855.56s -> 3879.61s]  heavier. Widen the webcam. Why? Can we wide screen? What are we looking for? Which cat? Which cat?
[3879.61s -> 3883.38s]  Which cat? Where is it? Where? Where? Where? Where? All right. I almost got this one done.
[3883.94s -> 3906.01s]  Boss time. Speed up again. There's four. That one. The coffee bean. Praise. This game is cool. This
[3906.01s -> 3911.94s]  bat is cool. This game is cool. Oh, that dribble was a character's name. That's okay. I thought
[3911.94s -> 3922.04s]  dribble was a character. Out wit. Oh, it's Hungra. You can attack now. What will you do?
[3924.52s -> 3929.98s]  Left jab. That hurt it a bit. Hungra is attacking. What will you do?
[3931.34s -> 3945.54s]  Crouch. Try using magic. What will you use? Curse. Curse. Last chance. Time it and press A.
[3947.77s -> 3951.69s]  Okay, success. I almost just pressed A on failure. That would have been very bad.
[3952.79s -> 3966.62s]  You failed. Hungra. Get it. Want to dance? Nothing in there anymore. All right. Dr.
[3966.62s -> 3987.18s]  Prigor. Wait, do I have to press A when pinched? One. Okay. Cut. Eat. Oh, I want a T. How do I get a
[3987.18s -> 4013.19s]  T? What a strange game. All right. Let me get this one without even having to stop. Oh, look at this.
[4013.19s -> 4027.77s]  I love that. I'm going to do like the JPEG with the face and stuff. Eat. Pray. Now the little dog
[4027.77s -> 4040.65s]  ones. When they make the ears like a little animation. Fight. Build up. I don't. Okay.
[4040.65s -> 4049.64s]  Build up. Does this only play with one button? It's played with a couple. Like two. A. Up,
[4049.64s -> 4061.19s]  down, left, right. That's typically how it works. This one's called reality. Oh, fuck.
[4062.07s -> 4083.38s]  Can I restart? Connect. That was easy. I'm looking forward to the super insane
[4085.24s -> 4093.77s]  times 10 speed one. Pick a hand. Wait, is that assuming that the other one? Pick a hand?
[4094.73s -> 4119.29s]  Hunt. Probably A. Smash two. Eat. All right. This is where we have to pay attention. Get it.
[4128.12s -> 4134.46s]  Did I get it? Okay. Oh, just barely. It's okay. He's still edible.
[4135.34s -> 4161.70s]  Bidet. Level up. What does that mean? What does that mean I'm doing too good? Oh, it means I'm
[4161.70s -> 4175.85s]  doing good. Nice. Oh, got it. Repel. I don't even know what the fuck he's talking about. A, left,
[4175.85s -> 4186.78s]  right, move. I can't even. The day means doing good. Plate. All right. Almost there. Watch out.
[4187.58s -> 4214.82s]  There are only five buttons. A lot if you think about it. Yes. The devil. I only need to get one.
[4214.82s -> 4237.62s]  Okay. That's the one I had to get. Here we go. Boss fight. Defend. I'm a vase? Oh, shit. Holy fuck.
[4239.50s -> 4299.29s]  Don't move. I did it. Cell tower noise. Must. Take. Break. Cat and Ana. Wow, there's no video game
[4299.29s -> 4311.94s]  with the slug. Oh, the snail. I want that game. Cover. Press A during cutscene. Yeah, I want. Oh,
[4311.94s -> 4323.67s]  okay. He has to press a button when it comes up. Shoot. I want more picture games. Remember that
[4323.67s -> 4331.35s]  game Africa? It was so fun. That game was so much fun. Just taking photos and getting raided on them
[4331.35s -> 4346.97s]  and stuff. I so badly want to play another one of those. Borrow. Oh. Get in the water?
[4347.61s -> 4374.22s]  This one's not that bad. Scare him. Pokemon Snap. Yeah, we can do that. What does it want me to do?
[4374.22s -> 4386.39s]  Clear? Oh, like hit it in the wood? I'll play Pokemon Snap. It's not that fun. Oh, you gotta
[4388.62s -> 4411.62s]  hit it right in the center. Good day job, dude. Got it. Mad because bad. He's mad because bad.
[4411.62s -> 4436.39s]  Mad because bad. Mad because bad. Catch. Oh, what? He caught it. He caught it. I'm trying to. He's
[4436.39s -> 4469.46s]  the analog. No more analog. Bad because mad. Mad because analog. Analog. Analog. We're good. Nice.
[4475.90s -> 4488.06s]  Got it. He's molding. Why do you? How do you? Where do you get that idea?
[4489.54s -> 4522.36s]  I'd love that creature. I want it. That one was tricky. Speed up. Micro-malled.
[4525.88s -> 4551.93s]  Get off my fucking screen. Finish. Oh, there's another classic turbo web stream. Which one
[4551.93s -> 4562.09s]  I'm supposed to lick? Which one was I supposed to lick? I'll get it. I'll get it this time. This is
[4562.09s -> 4582.92s]  the one. This is the one. I thought the other one. I thought the one in the middle was going to move.
[4582.92s -> 4588.60s]  Why does it keep doing Game Boy Advance? Is this a port? No, it's not. This one came out for the
[4588.60s -> 4607.72s]  GameCube. Exclusively for the GameCube. It is. It is. It is literally a Game Boy Advance game.
[4610.42s -> 4630.04s]  Wasn't it literally made for every other console? The GBA version is better.
[4630.76s -> 4639.96s]  Well, we're playing this one. Catch Fruit. What does the bottom of the screen say? It says
[4640.84s -> 4649.21s]  Game Boy Advance. It says Game Boy Advance at the bottom. Yeah, but it's pretending to be a Game Boy
[4656.26s -> 4680.79s]  flying rat. I know. Stop pretending. I almost fucked that up. All right, I got it. No, fuck
[4680.79s -> 4728.47s]  ups. Here we go. Got to get a ball. Fight. Oh, that was risky, but I did it. Here we go. Jump.
[4744.30s -> 4785.82s]  I'm not going for more than one at a time. That's a mistake. All right. Don't call me a coward.
[4785.82s -> 4791.70s]  All right. Is this the end of the game here? Is this the final level? Am I about to beat the game?
[4792.34s -> 4803.93s]  I'm about to beat the game. Am I? Anything goes Wario. Anything goes Wario. Oh, okay.
[4803.93s -> 4831.88s]  People have nightmares about that shit. Catch. That's a broken fucking nose. Oh.
[4836.25s -> 4846.17s]  Wrestle. What? I don't know. I was supposed to go for it. Crush it. We're going to have to restart
[4846.17s -> 4886.81s]  this one. Never thumb wrestled. Anything goes. Compete. Munch. You're going to lost a pinball.
[4886.81s -> 4893.83s]  Of course I did. Create. All right. He's just going to throw a bunch of shit on his face.
[4895.27s -> 4929.48s]  Raze. All right. Speed up. Oh, he's a beetle. That's disgusting. Wrestle. Be nice to beetles.
[4930.04s -> 4933.40s]  I like beetles. They're cool. They're fine. What's wrong with beetles?
[4939.85s -> 4963.93s]  Hide. Oh, hide your fucking stomach. Level up. Oh, I thought I had to tap A to go faster or left or
[4963.93s -> 5000.20s]  I don't know. Dude. Did I get it? You got to get Wario's eyes. That's correct. I'm going to get 25
[5000.20s -> 5012.86s]  and then I'm doing the super 100. What? If you do it too much or fast his belly button shoots out.
[5013.74s -> 5059.32s]  I'm doing super 100 after this for sure. It's going a little too fast. Literally can't beat it.
[5059.88s -> 5096.95s]  Got him. Got him. Get all those cherries. You fucking idiot. What am I grabbing? I don't even
[5096.95s -> 5124.89s]  know what the fuck I'm supposed to grab. This is the one. You notice how pinball and pinwheel

[6076.12s -> 6089.29s]  I don't want to click. That one's freaking me out. You're freaking me out. How to make
[6089.29s -> 6129.74s]  yourself look ugly. There is no clip. You guys are a bunch of liars. All right.
[6134.97s -> 6146.31s]  I can't do those. Am I using the filter to make your eyes look more blue?
[6149.13s -> 6156.90s]  What? I'm not like a fucking psycho. I'm going to put a filter on today to make my eyes look
[6156.90s -> 6166.81s]  wicked fucking blue. What are you talking about? I got bullied into putting the cam on in the first
[6166.81s -> 6185.61s]  place. Perfect. Guys, this is not a purple twitch hoodie. This is a blue twitch hoodie.

[6272.86s -> 6278.18s]  This is not from this one. Those noises. I can, I can, I can, I can smell those noises.
[6278.66s -> 6292.09s]  I've heard them a million times before in like an NES game. Bubble Bobble? Yeah, maybe. Not Yoshi.
[6292.09s -> 6309.06s]  No, no, no, no, no. Bubble Bobble? Yeah, definitely. Pugs Bunny and Crazy Castle.

[6350.57s -> 6356.33s]  wants me to do. I know it's the ones, the ones that are spinning. And so when you do this,
[6356.33s -> 6359.85s]  what you're trying to do is you're trying to spread it up. Blue shadow will make it so
[6360.41s -> 6363.53s]  it'll accentuate your eyes. And then what you're going to do is you're going to take the blush
[6363.53s -> 6367.05s]  brush right here and you're going to add it to this part and you're going to give yourself a
[6367.05s -> 6378.70s]  nice little shine here. Fucking damn it. I want to beat this. Oh my fucking God. And
[6393.03s -> 6399.14s]  this is a celebrity meltdown. I'm not a celebrity. Where do you get this idea of a celebrity?
[6405.98s -> 6423.30s]  Celebrity? He's an E-celebrity. Just press every button. It doesn't matter. You're a top 10
[6423.30s -> 6433.05s]  Twitch streamer. Is that even accurate? You have 7,000 people watch you several times a week.
[6435.69s -> 6440.66s]  Well, I'm glad you think I'm a celebrity. Which way do I go?
[6442.87s -> 6446.79s]  There was no way to go. He's dead no matter what. He's just fucking dead.
[6447.59s -> 6465.16s]  Let me try hard. Don't inflate his ego. I have to get at least 25. Otherwise I
[6465.48s -> 6475.58s]  refuse to stop playing until I get to 25. I have to. If you're a celebrity, why did you ignore me?
[6475.58s -> 6478.38s]  Why didn't you ignore me at the grocery store? Wait, what are you talking about?
[6479.34s -> 6485.54s]  Is this this this this this this this thing again? All like you're doing now? Yeah. Right.

[6550.57s -> 6561.78s]  fucking outrageous. But I give that person like at least 10 minutes to think about what they've said.
[6561.78s -> 6569.45s]  Like you've got to think about what you've said there. I'd like for you to press like tab up
[6569.45s -> 6573.53s]  and see the last thing that you wrote. I'd like you to sit there in your 10 minutes of
[6573.53s -> 6581.35s]  silence and solitude here to say yeah I think this is this is worth other people reading this.
[6585.61s -> 6591.46s]  I want you to read. I want you to really sit there and process each word and then come back to us
[6591.46s -> 6599.56s]  with your assessment after we after you're back from the band. What did he say? Something. Something
[6599.56s -> 6605.72s]  fucking heinous. Just so disgusting and heinous that like they we have to they have to be you
[6605.72s -> 6617.43s]  have to be punished. Where did it go? What do you think about what you've done?
[6618.86s -> 6624.39s]  Nobody knows what you're talking about. Only one person needs to know and it's the person
[6624.39s -> 6640.42s]  that said the naughty thing. A perv abandon. What the fuck do you think is going to happen?
[6641.14s -> 6644.78s]  What do you think is going to happen? Hold on. I'm bad at these.
[6673.69s -> 6692.60s]  Slow mode. Slow mode. Slow mode. Help us. Slow mode. Help us. Did I lose? Hey Bowser. Get the
[6692.60s -> 6707.21s]  heck out of here. Perfect pixel. Nobody said slow mode. I did. Double finger in the nose.

[6747.42s -> 6750.94s]  guys. I'm eating. What are you eating? What do you want to say? I think you're eating a bacon,
[6750.94s -> 6761.59s]  lettuce, and fucking tomato sandwich. Hey look at you Lindsay. Look at me. This game is
[6764.15s -> 6776.47s]  intriguing. Can I just be very clear about something? The BLT is a dog shit sandwich.
[6777.19s -> 6783.03s]  It's just a condiment fucking sandwich. It's just where's the thing that goes underneath all that?
[6785.13s -> 6788.41s]  Lettuce, tomato, and bacon with bread. Where's the thing that goes underneath it?
[6789.21s -> 6797.82s]  That's what a scam of a sandwich. Like imagine if you went to like a sub shop and you paid eight
[6797.82s -> 6802.46s]  dollars for a large BLT and eight dollars for like a large chicken palm. You're getting way more
[6802.46s -> 6813.40s]  fucking food telecommunicated down into your esophagus. BLT. And then people do what? BMT is
[6813.40s -> 6818.97s]  what people do. This game is groovy. Bacon, meat, and tomato. It's like just call it a fucking
[6818.97s -> 6837.94s]  regular sandwich. Oh my god that's hard. If you put egg on there that's no that's a substantial
[6837.94s -> 6842.66s]  addition then but why would you know but lettuce, tomato, and on a lettuce on an egg sandwich.
[6843.48s -> 6857.59s]  I wouldn't eat a lettuce egg sandwich. I wouldn't eat lettuce eggs. An egg like a bacon, egg, and
[6857.59s -> 6872.84s]  cheese sandwich with lettuce on it. I'm not gonna eat a bacon, tomato, and lettuce, cheese, and egg
[6872.84s -> 6894.15s]  sandwich on like a croissant. Starbucks sandwich. Oh Starbucks sandwich. No Starbucks sandwich is
[6894.15s -> 6912.10s]  like an egg white tomato paste wrap with feta cheese, spinach, and avocado oil in it. What's
[6912.10s -> 6922.86s]  wrong with feta? Nothing. Spinach feta wrap is 10 out of 10. I'm not I don't understand the egg
[6922.86s -> 6929.26s]  white thing. I want I want I want the fucking I want the B vitamins and I want the I want the
[6930.30s -> 6948.26s]  fun part. Did I really not get it? High cholesterol. Yeah yeah yeah oh high cholesterol yeah you got
[6948.26s -> 6952.98s]  a high cholesterol. It's and that's in so many studies proving that the cholesterol in the egg
[6952.98s -> 6957.06s]  yolks is really not even a big fucking deal and all the vitamins and all the nutrients you get from
[6957.06s -> 6964.90s]  the egg yolk are are so much better than you deleting it from your life. You know you know
[6964.90s -> 6980.58s]  how many studies there have been to prove what I'm saying correct? Am I ever gonna get 25?
[7000.38s -> 7004.86s]  Return. Webcam is desynced. I'm sure it is.
[7009.43s -> 7026.15s]  I'm trying. One guy said that. I thought we synced it up alright well. Chat stop you are killing
[7026.15s -> 7049.51s]  Jerma. Quick stretch of webcam. I got eaten by the ground. What the fuck? Alright I'm gonna
[7049.51s -> 7055.32s]  do this three more times. This one doesn't count. This one doesn't count. This one doesn't count.
[7055.32s -> 7079.08s]  That didn't count. That one didn't count. Have I done anything on thrilling mode?
[7080.68s -> 7091.70s]  Um I think this isn't this is thrilling mode. Where we are now. Still on the pig level. Omega

[7280.30s -> 7286.54s]  it. I pressed up. It was up up down. I pressed up first. What the hell? I don't understand. I
[7286.54s -> 7304.54s]  pressed up. I pressed up. I did press up. I pressed it. Go back in the bottom. Look. I said I pressed
[7304.54s -> 7307.10s]  it. That means I pressed it. I said it. If you look at the bot I said it right after I did it.
[7307.90s -> 7318.49s]  He's still going. I'm trying. I'm interested. This is the hard. This is insane mode. This is
[7318.49s -> 7336.89s]  thrilling mode. I gotta get to at least 25. I have to. Streaming for 2,000 more years.

[7370.18s -> 7378.68s]  Oh. I thought he was gonna hurt me if I touched him. I thought he was gonna hurt me if I touched
[7378.68s -> 7386.63s]  him. I don't know. Okay. I'm choking. I know. But it's hard. Not a leaf. That's a butterfly.
[7393.43s -> 7429.82s]  Eight. Damn. That's fucking hard. Come on. That one's hard to determine. That one's hard to
[7429.82s -> 7454.41s]  determine. I did it right. You just have a whole wheelie. But I got the 19s the highest. Give me
[7454.41s -> 7478.52s]  some easy ones in a row. The poop. That guy's back. What'd he say? What'd they say? They came
[7478.52s -> 7494.74s]  back and just said poop. That's it? That's okay. Just don't fucking do that. Don't do that again.
[7511.05s -> 7520.04s]  He mocked you. You don't. All right. You don't want to come into the king's court with a stick
[7520.04s -> 7525.72s]  this big. It's this small. It's like a twig that you broke off fucking like a tree. You came before
[7525.72s -> 7530.12s]  into coming into my court and you're gonna be like hey I've got something to say to you and
[7530.12s -> 7535.96s]  you're talking about the king that has like a plus 200 damage like lightning enchanted great sword
[7535.96s -> 7542.49s]  that is as tall as the ceiling and it's as light as a small baseball bat and I just literally have
[7542.49s -> 7548.81s]  to go like this and I fucking cast lightning down like Legend of Zelda on you and and I don't think
[7548.81s -> 7554.23s]  you want to do that. I've got an incredibly powerful sword versus your less powerful twig.
[7555.19s -> 7576.07s]  He's what? He's a king? Ego maniac. What? What? That's overcompensating. How so? I got what?
[7576.07s -> 7582.47s]  Because I have this huge fucking gigantic sword that's bigger than everybody else's and I can
[7583.11s -> 7587.91s]  okay that might be all right so the sword is the sword is not as high as tall as the ceiling. The

[7593.27s -> 7596.79s]  wand. It's this big. It's small and it can fit in my hand. It's like a Harry Potter's wand. You
