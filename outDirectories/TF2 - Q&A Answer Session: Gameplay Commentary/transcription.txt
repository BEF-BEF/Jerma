[3.45s -> 14.09s]  Hey what's up everybody, it's Germa here with the answers portion of my Q&A.
[14.09s -> 23.33s]  Before I get into this, I want to just say that the background of all this is going to be the TF2 super crazy fun time event that I had last week at some point.
[23.33s -> 31.50s]  I think it was like three or four days ago. We did like Scout on Scout Melee only. We did Demoman only Demo Night versus Pyro.
[32.10s -> 37.10s]  We did a bunch of crazy, crazy crap so hopefully you'll enjoy it and it's kind of funny.
[37.10s -> 46.41s]  I couldn't really do a gameplay commentary on it because obviously it's just a bunch of like insanity so there's no way I could have done a gameplay commentary.
[46.41s -> 49.41s]  So I'm going to let it go in the background and if you want to pay attention to that, that's cool.
[49.41s -> 51.41s]  If you want to listen to my voice, that's cool too.
[51.41s -> 53.41s]  So here we go, time to answer your questions.
[53.41s -> 60.17s]  I'm going to start off with the basic questions first. A lot of people ask these so I'm just going to get right into it.
[60.77s -> 68.18s]  How old are you? I'm actually kind of old. I don't look that old but I'm a lot older than you might think.
[68.18s -> 74.18s]  I'm 25 years old so if some of you thought I was like 19 or 18 or something, you were so wrong.
[74.18s -> 76.74s]  I'm 25.
[76.74s -> 80.74s]  Where do you live? I think I've answered this before but just for the sake of it.
[80.74s -> 85.30s]  Boston, I live in Boston, not New Jersey, not New York. Boston.
[85.30s -> 87.30s]  What do you do for work?
[87.30s -> 91.48s]  This is kind of a difficult question because I do a few things.
[92.08s -> 95.08s]  For most of my money, I am a freelance videographer.
[95.08s -> 99.08s]  I have a big expensive HD camera and that's what I film.
[99.08s -> 103.32s]  I film weddings, I film events, promos, music videos. I do a lot of crap.
[103.32s -> 105.32s]  So that's kind of what I do for money.
[105.32s -> 111.32s]  And I used to before, recently, maybe like two or three months ago, I kind of stopped doing it.
[111.32s -> 114.56s]  But I was a substitute teacher at a middle school.
[114.56s -> 118.14s]  So there you go, that's what I do for work.
[118.14s -> 120.14s]  How did you meet Leptor?
[120.14s -> 124.02s]  Leptor, I met him by, I asked him a question.
[124.02s -> 127.02s]  I sent him a message because I was getting kind of big.
[127.02s -> 131.02s]  When I say kind of big, I mean like I was at like six or seven hundred subscribers.
[131.02s -> 136.20s]  And I was just looking for advice because the channel was growing so fast and so rapidly that
[136.20s -> 139.38s]  I was looking for somebody that had a big channel.
[139.38s -> 142.38s]  What to do about all the people and how to go about growing even more.
[142.38s -> 145.38s]  So I sent Leptor a message. I sent IRSnipeR.
[145.38s -> 148.74s]  I sent Shibya a message. I tried to talk to Star.
[148.74s -> 150.74s]  And I got a few replies back. I got one from Leptor.
[150.74s -> 152.74s]  Leptor most notably because Leptor said,
[152.74s -> 155.74s]  Hey, why don't you go on my channel? Your stuff is great.
[155.74s -> 157.74s]  I will put you on my channel because I like you.
[157.74s -> 159.74s]  And I said, well, you know what? I like you too.
[159.74s -> 162.05s]  So that's how we kind of became buddies.
[162.05s -> 165.05s]  And we, to this day now, we're still good internet buddies.
[165.05s -> 169.48s]  The next question is not really a question, but it's more of a request.
[169.48s -> 173.48s]  And it was from Leptor, actually, who we just talked about.
[173.48s -> 175.48s]  So I'm going to take his request into consideration.
[175.48s -> 179.72s]  And for the next two questions, I am going to fulfill Leptor's request.
[179.72s -> 182.72s]  If you knew what it was, then cool. If you don't, well, I'm sure you're going to find out.
[182.72s -> 186.11s]  Why don't you use the fast switch on TF2?
[186.11s -> 188.35s]  Oh, listen, okay, let me tell you something.
[188.35s -> 191.70s]  Fast switch on TF2, it's just a little hard. It's hard to do it.
[191.70s -> 194.70s]  You know, I can't do quick switching. It screws with my brain, you know.
[194.70s -> 196.70s]  It really, you know, makes me look like an idiot, you know what I'm talking about.
[196.70s -> 199.70s]  It makes me crazy. You know, it makes me a stupid fucking idiot
[199.70s -> 201.70s]  whenever I try to upload a video.
[201.70s -> 205.70s]  I'm getting tired of this. I'm getting tired of fucking doing this every day.
[205.70s -> 208.71s]  I didn't even answer the question. So anyways.
[208.71s -> 210.71s]  Why don't you use fast switch on TF2?
[210.71s -> 214.34s]  Fast switch on TF2, it's because whenever I hit one,
[214.34s -> 216.34s]  I'm always accidentally hitting buttons in this game.
[216.34s -> 219.34s]  So if I accidentally hit a button, it's going to switch my weapon.
[219.34s -> 223.34s]  So I like to accidentally hit a button and see, no shit, I didn't want to do that and go right back.
[223.34s -> 225.34s]  So that's why I don't use quick switch.
[225.34s -> 228.51s]  The next question is, what would you do for a Klondike bar?
[228.51s -> 230.51s]  I got this a lot. Too many people were asking about Klondike bars,
[230.51s -> 232.51s]  which, you know, Klondike bars suck.
[232.51s -> 234.51s]  I'd rather eat the heavy sandwich, to be honest, because he's a fat fuck.
[234.51s -> 235.51s]  You know what I'm talking about.
[235.51s -> 239.51s]  But anyways, I don't think I want to eat a Klondike bar because Klondike bars kind of suck.
[239.51s -> 242.07s]  They kind of, you know, they taste kind of like dog crap.
[242.07s -> 244.07s]  You know what I'm talking about? I'm not going to eat it.
[244.07s -> 248.50s]  No, I would not do anything for a Klondike bar because I don't really like Klondike bars.
[248.50s -> 250.50s]  They're too messy.
[255.37s -> 259.37s]  I mean, if that's your goal, if that's your goal in life is to be a pawn star.
[259.37s -> 261.37s]  I've been watching too much A&E lately, sorry.
[261.37s -> 267.67s]  A pawn star, if you think you can pull it off, then once you get old enough, I guess go for it.
[273.42s -> 276.73s]  And absolutely, brother, bring it on.
[276.73s -> 278.73s]  You bring the knives, I'll bring the beer.
[278.73s -> 282.17s]  Even though I don't really drink beer.
[286.17s -> 291.17s]  I know some classes and loadouts can be more useful depending on the map, but which is the most fun?
[291.17s -> 295.73s]  In my opinion, the most fun thing to play in Team Fortress 2 is a Huntsman Sniper.
[295.73s -> 301.73s]  Huntsman Sniper with the Jurati and the Bushwhacker, I think, is the most entertaining thing to play.
[302.73s -> 307.73s]  Because it's a lot of fun just aiming at people, shooting arrows, pretending like you're in Lord of the Rings and stuff like that.
[307.73s -> 312.73s]  It's just a really fun, interesting setup, so that's probably the most fun class to play.
[318.78s -> 321.82s]  Soon, soon.
[321.82s -> 328.13s]  When I say soon, that could mean like a couple months from now, but I'm going to try as hard as I can to get that sooner.
[328.13s -> 332.13s]  Me and Leptor were actually talking about buying a dedicated server together and splitting it,
[332.13s -> 337.13s]  so there might be a Germa Leptor server at some point in the near future, so look out for that.
[340.26s -> 345.41s]  No, I hate Jello. It is the worst.
[352.16s -> 358.16s]  Yes, before I started doing commentaries, believe it or not, I talked all the time on the mics in Team Fortress 2,
[358.16s -> 364.34s]  and now that I've kind of gotten a little bit of a following, I've shied away in public servers doing that,
[364.34s -> 370.34s]  because I don't want to give myself like a bad name, like, oh, dude, Nihal Medic, hit the Uber next time, you idiot.
[370.34s -> 375.34s]  Like, I feel like I could really get myself in a little bit of trouble now if I try and do that now.
[375.34s -> 379.58s]  But yes, a couple years ago, I used to do that quite frequently, so.
[379.58s -> 386.03s]  What kind of music do you like? I got a bunch of these, so I'm going to put these all in the same category.
[386.03s -> 390.03s]  What music do you like? What's your favorite band? What's your favorite song? I'm going to do them all right now.
[390.03s -> 396.40s]  My favorite band is the Gorillaz. I think that they are the only band you should be listening to right now,
[396.40s -> 401.40s]  because everything else is this, you know, pop dance floor crap that everyone seems to love now.
[401.40s -> 406.64s]  And if you love that, then that's your own opinion. I'm not going to say that it's a wrong opinion.
[406.64s -> 412.82s]  I just say that I don't like that crap. Let me reiterate that. I don't like that garbage.
[412.82s -> 419.06s]  I'm just kidding, obviously. But Gorillaz are my favorite band. My favorite song is Stylo from the Gorillaz.
[419.06s -> 425.06s]  If you've never heard Stylo, please, God, go listen to it right now. For the love of God, go play it.
[425.06s -> 431.49s]  And what's your favorite type of music? My favorite type of music is alternative, kind of like alternative rock,
[431.49s -> 436.49s]  alternative like trance. Not like techno, but like I said, the Gorillaz are my favorite band.
[436.49s -> 443.26s]  So that type of, you know, electro pop, electro alternative, that's my favorite type of music.
[443.26s -> 447.26s]  DMACDouble asks, what's your favorite thing about Tim Robbins?
[449.58s -> 458.78s]  My favorite thing about Tim Robbins is probably his incredible acting experience, his great demeanor on the stage and screen,
[458.78s -> 466.39s]  and how nice he is to people that are on set with him, because that's what I've heard.
[466.39s -> 472.21s]  How did you react when you saw that you had so many subscribers with so few videos?
[472.21s -> 479.50s]  Happy and shocked. I guess that's the only thing I can really say is I was really, really happy.
[479.50s -> 484.68s]  Here's a really quick story, actually, for you guys. I'm sure some of you would think this is actually kind of interesting.
[484.68s -> 493.54s]  When I first did my first Team Fortress 2 commentary a couple months ago, I did two in a row, and I uploaded them on the same night,
[493.54s -> 503.78s]  and the next morning I woke up and I said, I don't want to do this. No one's going to watch me. I'm too old for this. I can't do this.
[503.78s -> 507.27s]  So I deleted all the videos and I was going to delete the account.
[507.27s -> 513.82s]  Then I talked to a friend of mine who said, you know what? You might as well just go for it, and you might as well have fun with it,
[513.82s -> 519.82s]  because what are you going to lose? What are you going to lose? People are going to think you're a dork or something?
[519.82s -> 523.12s]  I already am a dork. I've been a dork my whole life.
[523.12s -> 528.42s]  So one of my buddies actually was the one that convinced me to continue doing it, and I brought the videos back.
[528.42s -> 535.29s]  So if it wasn't for my real-life friend, these videos would not exist, and I'm so glad that I did,
[535.29s -> 538.29s]  because you guys are all so awesome, and I've had so much fun so far.
[538.29s -> 542.29s]  So I look forward to a nice, real long-term relationship with a lot of you guys.
[542.29s -> 546.29s]  Hopefully you stick around in the months and years to come, because I'll be here.
[546.29s -> 549.87s]  So I hope we have some good times.
[553.87s -> 556.43s]  That's two questions. I kind of molded them together.
[556.43s -> 562.43s]  I have owned Team Fortress 2 since the very beginning, since it first came out. I played in the beta.
[562.43s -> 571.47s]  They did like a promo where if you bought the game, like a pre-order of the game, you could play for two or three weeks before the release.
[571.47s -> 575.47s]  That's when I bought the game. I played in October. It released at the end of October or something.
[575.47s -> 578.47s]  So I played like two or three weeks before everyone else did in the beta.
[578.47s -> 584.08s]  And it's been three, four, five years since the game came out, so that's how long I've been playing.
[584.08s -> 590.08s]  How many hours do I have? I have 600 hours played in the game, which is not that much compared to a lot of people,
[590.08s -> 596.08s]  but you got to remember I'm 25 years old and I have other obligations and I have other things I have to do every day.
[596.08s -> 600.64s]  So when I was in college, that's where a lot of those hours came from when I was in college.
[600.64s -> 606.52s]  Did you become friends with most of the other Team Fortress 2 subscri- I think he means to say commentators.
[606.52s -> 612.52s]  So did you become friends with most of the other Team Fortress 2 commentators before Leptor featured you or after?
[612.52s -> 615.52s]  Because it seems that recently everybody knows you.
[615.52s -> 621.19s]  Uh, no. Leptor is the only guy that I really have a speaking relationship with.
[621.19s -> 625.37s]  So before Leptor, it was just me. It was just me.
[625.37s -> 629.37s]  And then I think it's because the fact that I have almost 2,000 subscribers now
[629.37s -> 636.37s]  is the reason why people are kind of starting to pay attention to the channel and the channel is actually starting to get a little bit of legitimacy now
[636.37s -> 638.37s]  because you guys are all still coming.
[638.37s -> 641.61s]  So keep coming and this channel will get even more legit.
[641.61s -> 646.45s]  Have you ever kissed two girls at the same time?
[646.45s -> 650.39s]  No. Unfortunately I have not.
[650.39s -> 654.78s]  What is your favorite Engineer Melee weapon?
[654.78s -> 659.60s]  Definitely the Jag and I know the Jag is a gimmick weapon and some of you guys are going to say,
[659.60s -> 663.60s]  that's a gimmick weapon, come on, it's got to be like the Southern Hospitality or something.
[663.60s -> 667.84s]  No, I really like the Jag only because building up a dispenser,
[667.84s -> 671.84s]  saving that 1.3 seconds, whatever it is,
[671.84s -> 675.84s]  it really does help in some situations and it looks really cool.
[675.84s -> 680.36s]  I like the weapon and how it looks. So that's why it is.
[680.36s -> 686.39s]  Do you want to fish slap Star for pure randomness?
[686.39s -> 690.70s]  No, I don't because I don't have a speaking relationship with Star.
[690.70s -> 695.66s]  I've never had a conversation with him really so.
[695.66s -> 699.66s]  Do you own Killing Floor and if you do, would you be willing to record some gameplay of it?
[699.66s -> 702.16s]  I do not own Killing Floor.
[702.16s -> 705.16s]  It's a game that I thought when it first came out it was sort of a Left 4 Dead clone
[705.16s -> 708.16s]  and I already had Left 4 Dead so I didn't want to get it.
[708.16s -> 711.16s]  But if people want me to play it and if it's good enough,
[711.16s -> 714.16s]  then yeah, eventually here once I'm done with all these other games I'm doing,
[714.16s -> 716.16s]  then maybe yeah, I'll try doing a Let's Play of it.
[716.16s -> 721.34s]  Will my comment be in the video? Yes, it will.
[721.34s -> 726.34s]  Nerayuxa32, Nerayuxa32, of course it will.
[726.34s -> 728.97s]  Why did you start playing TF2?
[728.97s -> 733.96s]  I started playing TF2 because I played Team Fortress Classic
[733.96s -> 738.96s]  way long ago when a lot of you guys were too young to even play video games
[738.96s -> 740.96s]  or to even understand some of these games.
[740.96s -> 742.96s]  Team Fortress Classic is Team Fortress 1.
[742.96s -> 750.14s]  I believe it was like 1996 or 1997 when it came out and I was like 14 or 15
[750.14s -> 754.55s]  and so your Team Fortress 2 is my Team Fortress 1.
[754.55s -> 758.92s]  You know how some of you, a lot of you guys are 13, 14, 15, 16,
[758.92s -> 760.92s]  a lot of you guys are pretty young.
[760.92s -> 765.92s]  So I was your age when I was your age I was playing Team Fortress 1.
[765.92s -> 768.29s]  So that's a little bit of info for you.
[768.29s -> 770.29s]  But obviously when Team Fortress 2 came out, the sequel,
[770.29s -> 773.29s]  it's a much better game so that's why I started playing it.
[773.29s -> 777.23s]  Why do I always check to see if you uploaded a new video?
[777.23s -> 781.10s]  Because you're the man and you're a critical viewer
[781.10s -> 785.10s]  and I love people like you so that's not a bad thing.
[785.10s -> 790.04s]  What is your favorite class and what do you think about the new soldier weapons?
[790.04s -> 794.71s]  I combine these two because a lot of people ask both of these questions so
[794.71s -> 796.71s]  my favorite class has changed over the years.
[796.71s -> 800.71s]  At first when I first got Team Fortress 2 and in Team Fortress Classic it was the Spy.
[800.71s -> 803.89s]  The Spy is just a lot of fun to play.
[803.89s -> 805.89s]  More recently however though it's been the Engineer.
[805.89s -> 808.89s]  The Engineer is probably my favorite class as of right now.
[808.89s -> 812.58s]  So Spy, Engineer, definitely my two favorites.
[812.58s -> 815.58s]  What do you think about the new soldier weapons?
[815.58s -> 817.58s]  I think that they are stupid.
[817.58s -> 819.58s]  I think they're just complete gimmicks and I think Valve
[819.58s -> 822.58s]  should never have added them into the game but you know,
[822.58s -> 827.64s]  20-20 hindsight you can't look back and say that because it's already here.
[827.64s -> 828.64s]  Just deal with it.
[828.64s -> 831.64s]  And they're actually kind of, the items are kind of fun to play with
[831.64s -> 832.94s]  but that's all they are.
[832.94s -> 835.94s]  They're items just to play with for one round and never use them again.
[835.94s -> 841.21s]  Can you fake Chao your friend's babysitter's aunt?
[841.21s -> 845.41s]  I have no idea what that even means.
[845.41s -> 848.35s]  So I'm going to say yes, no.
[848.35s -> 853.94s]  Do you love Jamps? says Jamps96.
[853.94s -> 857.56s]  I don't know, does Jamps love me?
[857.56s -> 860.18s]  Should Pluto be considered a planet?
[860.18s -> 863.81s]  Of course it should because you know what?
[863.81s -> 866.11s]  I say screw you to the scientists.
[866.11s -> 868.11s]  They can't do that to my boy Pluto.
[868.11s -> 872.11s]  He's been a planet since I was a little kid and it was the coolest thing
[872.11s -> 875.11s]  knowing Pluto was like the smallest, coolest planet
[875.11s -> 877.11s]  and now they're going to take it away from him.
[877.11s -> 878.61s]  Give me a break.
[878.61s -> 881.87s]  How long did it take you to become so sexy?
[881.87s -> 885.87s]  And any tips on how to achieve your sexiness?
[885.87s -> 891.25s]  Okay, first of all, the first part of the question is DNA, I believe
[891.25s -> 897.38s]  is how I became so sexy and my parents, I guess by genes
[897.38s -> 901.07s]  and any tips on how to achieve your sexiness?
[901.07s -> 905.74s]  Yeah, be yourself and have some confidence.
[905.74s -> 909.76s]  Only two tips I can really give.
[909.76s -> 912.64s]  Boxers or briefs, somebody says.
[912.64s -> 914.64s]  Funny, boxer briefs is what I wear.
[914.64s -> 915.64s]  Boxer briefs.
[915.64s -> 919.16s]  What is your favorite food?
[919.16s -> 923.54s]  Oh God, dude, this question is going to take a while.
[923.54s -> 924.54s]  No, it's not.
[924.54s -> 929.49s]  My favorite food is probably.
[929.49s -> 932.05s]  Oh God, it's like two or three options.
[932.05s -> 936.36s]  I'm just going to say the two that I'm going to give you two.
[936.36s -> 939.36s]  One is General Gao's chicken, like the Chinese food.
[939.36s -> 941.36s]  I think that's it's unbelievable.
[941.36s -> 943.79s]  And the other one is chicken cutlets.
[943.79s -> 946.79s]  And I'm not talking just regular boring ass chicken cutlets.
[946.79s -> 952.27s]  I'm talking about the real thin pressed crispy fried chicken cutlet.
[952.27s -> 955.47s]  So those are my two favorite foods.
[955.47s -> 957.47s]  This question is just potatoes.
[957.47s -> 959.90s]  Potatoes?
[959.90s -> 963.64s]  No, no potatoes.
[963.64s -> 967.20s]  What do you do when you're not playing video games?
[967.20s -> 971.57s]  Oh, that's a good question because I do quite a few things.
[971.57s -> 974.57s]  First of all, I am in a men's softball league
[974.57s -> 978.57s]  and we're currently going into the playoffs next week, so wish us luck.
[978.57s -> 980.06s]  So I do that.
[980.06s -> 981.06s]  I play men's softball.
[981.06s -> 984.06s]  I used to play like baseball, softball, you know, when I was younger.
[984.06s -> 985.37s]  And that's just continuing now.
[985.37s -> 986.37s]  I love sports.
[986.37s -> 988.37s]  So that's the reason why.
[988.37s -> 990.18s]  What else do I do?
[990.18s -> 991.18s]  I do lifting.
[991.18s -> 992.18s]  Like I said before, I do a lot of workouts.
[992.18s -> 995.18s]  So, you know, three or four or five days a week, I'm in the gym.
[995.18s -> 998.55s]  So I do that when I'm not gaming and obviously just hanging out with friends,
[998.55s -> 1000.55s]  hanging out with family, you know, just doing the old thing.
[1000.55s -> 1004.46s]  Do you like Borderlands?
[1004.46s -> 1006.70s]  I got that question four or five times.
[1006.70s -> 1008.70s]  Yeah, I do like Borderlands.
[1008.70s -> 1012.70s]  And you'd probably know that if you watched my Borderlands Let's Play with Leptor.
[1012.70s -> 1017.94s]  So the answer is yes, I do like Borderlands and go check out Leptor's page right now
[1017.94s -> 1023.18s]  because it has like at least 14 or 15 episodes right now of us playing Borderlands.
[1023.18s -> 1028.70s]  The next question is how big?
[1028.70s -> 1031.46s]  This big.
[1031.46s -> 1036.46s]  What do you think of people that always say, mainly in tutorial videos, go Google it.
[1036.46s -> 1039.95s]  I don't have time to add links, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1039.95s -> 1044.32s]  Ah, I think that if you're going to make a video for people that's going to teach them something,
[1044.32s -> 1049.50s]  I think that you should have all the information in the video, not like go, go do this, go do that.
[1049.50s -> 1052.50s]  I think if you're going to do it, especially a tutorial video,
[1052.50s -> 1055.80s]  you need to be able to tell people exactly what you're doing, where to go, what the hell.
[1055.80s -> 1057.80s]  You know, you have to give everybody all the information.
[1057.80s -> 1060.10s]  So I think that I agree.
[1060.10s -> 1061.10s]  I think that's a dumb thing.
[1061.10s -> 1066.11s]  Why does Google Chrome spell check say that Google needs to have the first letter uppercased?
[1066.11s -> 1069.29s]  Well, because Google is a noun.
[1069.29s -> 1070.29s]  It's a company.
[1070.29s -> 1072.29s]  So Google is a company, which is a noun, like I said.
[1072.29s -> 1074.29s]  So it has to have an uppercase letter at the beginning.
[1074.29s -> 1079.81s]  What do you think of the VAC, the anti-cheat system?
[1079.81s -> 1085.24s]  The anti-cheat system, I think it's great because it allows people to be afraid of hacking.
[1085.24s -> 1089.54s]  A lot of games don't put that fear in people, you know, like, oh, I'm going to go play, you know,
[1089.54s -> 1092.54s]  this game and there's no punkbuster or there's no VAC.
[1092.54s -> 1094.54s]  It's just I can do whatever the hell I want online.
[1094.54s -> 1102.87s]  VAC might have its flaws, but at least it's that wall that makes people afraid to do anything.
[1102.87s -> 1105.87s]  How did you get to know Shibby and why is he always so drunk?
[1105.87s -> 1109.82s]  Well, the first part of the question is pretty easy.
[1109.82s -> 1114.82s]  Just like Leptor, I sent Shibby a message and he sent me a reply back,
[1114.82s -> 1117.82s]  giving me some advice for the channel and he was a nice guy about it.
[1117.82s -> 1122.06s]  And as the channel grew, he, I guess, started to notice that people were hanging out here
[1122.06s -> 1125.06s]  and he was like, oh, who the hell is, hey, hey, what's going on, dude?
[1125.06s -> 1129.79s]  So and then we started talking and we became buddies and that's kind of how that happened.
[1129.79s -> 1130.79s]  And why is he always drunk?
[1130.79s -> 1133.10s]  Because he likes to have a good time.
[1133.10s -> 1134.10s]  Nothing wrong with that.
[1134.10s -> 1136.10s]  I'm not going to tell anybody what they can and can't do.
[1136.10s -> 1139.10s]  If you want to be drunk, if you want to have fun, I mean, he's only 23.
[1139.10s -> 1142.10s]  That's like the prime age to be like going out, having a good time all the time.
[1142.10s -> 1144.34s]  So I'm down with that.
[1144.34s -> 1145.34s]  That's fine for me.
[1145.34s -> 1149.79s]  What's your favorite game type and map in Team Fortress 2?
[1149.79s -> 1154.16s]  My favorite game type is Payload and my favorite map is Badwater.
[1154.16s -> 1157.16s]  I know that's like so cookie cutter, but that's the truth.
[1157.16s -> 1162.94s]  When will Team Fortress 3 come out and will it be microtransactions again?
[1162.94s -> 1165.14s]  Hmm.
[1165.14s -> 1170.14s]  Well, because I work at Valve, I'm going to tell you all the development plans of Valve.
[1170.14s -> 1177.44s]  And Team Fortress 3 is on pace to be released on January 16th of 2017.
[1177.44s -> 1180.68s]  And it's going to be all microtransactions.
[1180.68s -> 1187.29s]  And we're adding 18 more classes for a total of 29 classes, I think.
[1187.29s -> 1188.29s]  No. Yeah. Yeah.
[1188.29s -> 1191.46s]  So we're going to have like 30 classes in Team Fortress 3.
[1191.46s -> 1195.46s]  And it's going to cost $455 for a hat in the Manco store.
[1195.46s -> 1201.05s]  iAnimeKid3 asks, can you give me a hat?
[1201.05s -> 1202.74s]  No.
[1202.74s -> 1205.74s]  Because if I give you a hat, then I have to give everybody else a hat.
[1205.74s -> 1212.91s]  So once I end up with like 12, 15, 16, 1700 hats, sure, I'll give everybody a damn hat.
[1212.91s -> 1215.66s]  What is your favorite weapon in Team Fortress 2?
[1215.66s -> 1218.29s]  The Frontier Justice.
[1218.29s -> 1221.29s]  The Frontier Justice is the best weapon in the game, in my opinion.
[1221.29s -> 1223.29s]  It's my favorite. I've named it.
[1223.29s -> 1226.29s]  So, you know, when you name something, it's like your favorite thing.
[1226.29s -> 1229.78s]  Either that or the Connivorous Kunai. Those are my two favorite items.
[1229.78s -> 1233.18s]  What other games will you be posting?
[1233.18s -> 1236.80s]  If you've been watching the channel so far, you see that I have The Witcher 2.
[1236.80s -> 1240.80s]  It's kind of a semi-serious let's play I'm going to start doing.
[1240.80s -> 1245.04s]  I'm going to do it maybe once every two weeks. Once every week I'll put a new video up.
[1245.04s -> 1247.28s]  Don't worry for those people that are freaking out.
[1247.28s -> 1249.28s]  It's not going to take over Team Fortress.
[1249.28s -> 1252.28s]  It's a secondary let's play. I'm going to say that again one more time to reiterate.
[1252.28s -> 1254.28s]  It's a secondary let's play.
[1254.28s -> 1257.42s]  Where did the name Jerma come from?
[1257.42s -> 1260.04s]  The name Jerma, it's pretty self-explanatory.
[1260.04s -> 1263.04s]  It's my first name, kind of changed a little bit.
[1263.04s -> 1265.28s]  My name is Jeremy.
[1265.28s -> 1268.28s]  So Jeremy, Jerma, it's kind of a nickname I had in high school.
[1268.28s -> 1270.65s]  So that's where it came from.
[1270.65s -> 1275.79s]  Do you play Minecraft and do you play on a server?
[1275.79s -> 1278.79s]  I play Minecraft very, very, very infrequently.
[1278.79s -> 1280.79s]  And no, I don't play on any particular server.
[1280.79s -> 1282.79s]  I kind of just jump around whenever I feel like it.
[1282.79s -> 1284.79s]  Haven't really played Minecraft in a few weeks.
[1284.79s -> 1288.79s]  The last time I played it was actually a couple days ago, but it was just for fun.
[1288.79s -> 1292.03s]  We were playing on the Hunting Wolves server.
[1292.03s -> 1294.03s]  And he was really cool about it.
[1294.03s -> 1297.03s]  And we were there with Shibby and Leon was there.
[1297.03s -> 1298.03s]  There was a bunch of dudes there.
[1298.03s -> 1300.03s]  So it was a fun time, but I don't really play Minecraft at all.
[1300.03s -> 1304.03s]  I only play it when, like I said, it's going to be just a goofy fun time.
[1304.03s -> 1307.74s]  Do you think Mars is a cool planet?
[1307.74s -> 1315.24s]  What did I tell you guys about asking about the stupid Mars question?
[1315.24s -> 1318.18s]  Oh no, Mars is actually kind of a cool planet.
[1318.18s -> 1319.18s]  Yeah, it is.
[1319.18s -> 1322.19s]  Katy Perry or Megan Fox?
[1322.19s -> 1324.50s]  Megan Fox all the way, definitely.
[1324.50s -> 1329.08s]  Do you live alone and do you have a girlfriend?
[1329.08s -> 1332.15s]  For the first one, I do not live alone.
[1332.15s -> 1335.15s]  I just graduated college about a year and a half, two years ago.
[1335.15s -> 1339.46s]  So got back to the home with the parents just hanging out here for now.
[1339.46s -> 1341.46s]  Trying to find my own place somewhere in the near future.
[1341.46s -> 1343.46s]  But I'm at my house still living at home.
[1343.46s -> 1345.02s]  Do you have a girlfriend?
[1345.02s -> 1347.02s]  No, I do not currently have a girlfriend.
[1347.02s -> 1353.19s]  But this does not mean I am going to accept inquiries of inquiries of people asking me,
[1353.19s -> 1355.19s]  Oh, hey, you don't have a girlfriend.
[1355.19s -> 1356.19s]  Like, let's chat.
[1356.19s -> 1358.19s]  Like, no.
[1358.19s -> 1361.19s]  So you can forget about that already if that was your plan.
[1361.19s -> 1365.52s]  What is your absolute favorite setup in the whole game?
[1365.52s -> 1368.08s]  Kind of hard because I have one or two,
[1368.08s -> 1372.08s]  but probably the one that I go to all the time is Engineer,
[1372.08s -> 1377.26s]  and it's the Frontier Justice, the Pistol, and the Mini-Sentry.
[1377.26s -> 1379.26s]  That is my absolute favorite setup in the game.
[1379.26s -> 1380.26s]  I love it so much.
[1380.26s -> 1381.26s]  I wish I could play it every day,
[1381.26s -> 1384.26s]  and I wish I could just do all Engineer gameplays.
[1384.26s -> 1385.50s]  But no, that's a joke.
[1385.50s -> 1387.50s]  But no, that's my favorite.
[1387.50s -> 1391.25s]  You are pretty funny, so I was wondering what makes you laugh.
[1391.25s -> 1395.25s]  Do you have a favorite comedian or a favorite movie or a joke?
[1395.25s -> 1397.38s]  I have a favorite comedian.
[1397.38s -> 1399.38s]  My favorite comedian is Bill Burr.
[1399.38s -> 1401.38s]  He is hysterical.
[1401.38s -> 1404.38s]  He's from Boston, too, which makes it even better.
[1404.38s -> 1405.38s]  He's hilarious.
[1405.38s -> 1407.38s]  If you have never heard of Bill Burr, you never watch Bill Burr.
[1407.38s -> 1411.38s]  He's kind of on the 17, 18-plus side,
[1411.38s -> 1414.82s]  so I'm not going to recommend that to anybody right now.
[1414.82s -> 1417.82s]  But if you are of age and you like funny comedians,
[1417.82s -> 1418.82s]  then go check out Bill Burr.
[1418.82s -> 1420.38s]  Favorite movie?
[1420.38s -> 1422.38s]  I don't really have a favorite movie.
[1422.38s -> 1424.38s]  I don't really watch movies, to be honest.
[1424.38s -> 1426.38s]  The last time I went to the movies was probably to see
[1426.38s -> 1429.45s]  one of the Harry Potter movies a while back,
[1429.45s -> 1432.01s]  so I don't really have a favorite movie.
[1432.01s -> 1438.10s]  Every gamer eventually noms on something during their hours of play.
[1438.10s -> 1440.10s]  What do you normally snack on?
[1440.10s -> 1443.54s]  That's a good question because I don't snack on anything.
[1443.54s -> 1445.54s]  I'm a drinker when I play games.
[1445.54s -> 1447.78s]  I'm not talking about alcoholic beverages.
[1447.78s -> 1451.78s]  I'm talking about like fruit punch or a soda or something.
[1451.78s -> 1454.78s]  I'm more of a drinker than an eater when I play games.
[1454.78s -> 1456.78s]  Do you like cheese?
[1456.78s -> 1458.78s]  And if you do, what's your favorite cheese?
[1458.78s -> 1461.15s]  I do love cheese. I love it a lot.
[1461.15s -> 1462.15s]  And my favorite cheese is Swiss.
[1462.15s -> 1463.15s]  Swiss cheese is amazing.
[1463.15s -> 1467.22s]  What's your favorite survival horror game of all time?
[1467.22s -> 1469.91s]  Probably Resident Evil 4.
[1469.91s -> 1472.15s]  That's one of the games I beat two or three times
[1472.15s -> 1475.15s]  and did all the other extra stuff, so probably Resident Evil 4.
[1475.15s -> 1480.91s]  What would you add or remove class-wise in TF2?
[1480.91s -> 1482.91s]  I would not remove a class and I would not add a class
[1482.91s -> 1486.91s]  only because the game is just so balanced around the nine classes.
[1486.91s -> 1489.91s]  If you took somebody away, it would just screw everything up.
[1489.91s -> 1493.91s]  Definitely it would ruin everything, so I wouldn't add or remove anybody.
[1493.91s -> 1496.79s]  What would you like to work as?
[1496.79s -> 1501.87s]  Huh, probably this, to be honest.
[1501.87s -> 1505.62s]  If I could somehow get to a position where I was doing this every day
[1505.62s -> 1508.62s]  and you guys were all involved and everyone was having a good time
[1508.62s -> 1510.99s]  and I could do this for a profession, it would be huge.
[1510.99s -> 1514.62s]  That would be huge for me because I'm getting kind of old
[1514.62s -> 1518.62s]  and it would be nice in the next couple years to have something where I could go,
[1518.62s -> 1519.62s]  you know what, this is a whole lot of fun.
[1519.62s -> 1522.86s]  I go to work every day with a smile on my face
[1522.86s -> 1525.16s]  and this is what I would love to do.
[1525.16s -> 1527.16s]  Now, the question is, will that actually happen?
[1527.16s -> 1528.40s]  I don't know.
[1528.40s -> 1530.83s]  That's solely up to the amount of people that come to the channel,
[1530.83s -> 1535.44s]  the amount of people that stick around, and that's all up to you guys.
[1535.44s -> 1537.87s]  So that's what I would love to do, though.
[1537.87s -> 1539.87s]  I'd love to, you know, be a machinima partner or something
[1539.87s -> 1541.87s]  and make money doing this. It would be amazing.
[1541.87s -> 1546.03s]  Can you do a backflip?
[1546.03s -> 1549.98s]  It's funny because yes, I can.
[1549.98s -> 1552.98s]  I can do a backflip without my hands in the air.
[1552.98s -> 1554.98s]  That's not a joke.
[1554.98s -> 1556.98s]  And if anyone wants to give me hate on that,
[1556.98s -> 1560.98s]  I will post a video of me backflipping in the air without my hands.
[1560.98s -> 1562.98s]  So yes, I can.
[1562.98s -> 1563.98s]  Kind of an odd question, but yes.
[1563.98s -> 1566.98s]  Digimon or Pokemon?
[1566.98s -> 1570.67s]  Uh, neither.
[1570.67s -> 1573.67s]  Not a fan of either of them, but if I'd have to pick one,
[1573.67s -> 1576.67s]  probably Pokemon because it's the original, it's the older one.
[1576.67s -> 1582.11s]  What is the best thing to ever come in a Team Fortress 2 update?
[1582.11s -> 1583.11s]  Definitely payload.
[1583.11s -> 1586.11s]  Out of all the weapons, out of all the items, all the hats,
[1586.11s -> 1589.54s]  absolutely, it's definitely the addition of the payload game type
[1589.54s -> 1591.54s]  because that changed everything
[1591.54s -> 1593.54s]  and it made the game so much more popular,
[1593.54s -> 1596.54s]  so much more interesting, so I definitely would say payload.
[1596.54s -> 1601.55s]  Do you read, and if you do, what is your favorite book?
[1601.55s -> 1604.24s]  I don't really read a whole lot.
[1604.24s -> 1605.24s]  I don't read as much as I should.
[1605.24s -> 1607.24s]  I know that you're supposed to read at least like
[1607.24s -> 1610.24s]  five to 12 paragraphs a day to keep your brain working or whatever,
[1610.24s -> 1613.24s]  but I guess I do kind of read these comments.
[1613.24s -> 1614.24s]  I read graphic novels.
[1614.24s -> 1616.24s]  I don't know if they count, but I count that
[1616.24s -> 1620.24s]  because it's plenty of words, and if you want my favorite book,
[1620.24s -> 1623.61s]  if you want my favorite series, I guess you could say,
[1623.61s -> 1625.61s]  go look up a guy named Doug Tenapel.
[1625.61s -> 1629.91s]  Doug, T-E-N-N-E-P-A-L, Doug Tenapel.
[1629.91s -> 1633.22s]  He is the guy that created Earthworm Jim,
[1633.22s -> 1636.22s]  and he has insanely funny, insanely interesting graphic novels,
[1636.22s -> 1639.22s]  so go check about if you have never heard of him already.
[1639.22s -> 1642.90s]  What is your most hated class in Team Fortress 2?
[1642.90s -> 1644.66s]  As of right now, none.
[1644.66s -> 1646.66s]  I think the game is very, very balanced,
[1646.66s -> 1649.66s]  but two, three, four years ago,
[1649.66s -> 1651.66s]  it was definitely the Demoman and the Soldier,
[1651.66s -> 1652.66s]  and I'll tell you why.
[1652.66s -> 1657.02s]  A lot of you guys don't know this, but way back long ago,
[1657.02s -> 1661.26s]  the Demoman and the Soldier used to have much more ammunition.
[1661.26s -> 1664.26s]  I think right now the amount of rockets you have is 20.
[1664.26s -> 1666.26s]  It used to be somewhere around 40.
[1666.26s -> 1667.26s]  Same thing with the Demoman.
[1667.26s -> 1670.26s]  It's 16 pills you get in the grenade launcher.
[1670.26s -> 1672.26s]  It used to be like 36 or something.
[1672.26s -> 1675.26s]  It used to be insane, and it was a huge nerf.
[1675.26s -> 1678.26s]  When they did that, it was an enormous nerf to those classes.
[1678.26s -> 1682.53s]  What is your favorite hat in Team Fortress 2?
[1682.53s -> 1686.39s]  Definitely the one I currently have on the Heavy right now.
[1686.39s -> 1688.39s]  The Luchador, the Lodge Luchador.
[1688.39s -> 1691.46s]  It's hysterical. It's the best thing ever.
[1691.46s -> 1692.46s]  Do you have any dogs or cats?
[1692.46s -> 1696.70s]  Yes, I do. I have two dogs and three cats.
[1696.70s -> 1699.01s]  Yeah, my family's really crazy about animals.
[1699.01s -> 1704.40s]  Who is your favorite Team Fortress 2 commentator besides yourself?
[1704.40s -> 1707.90s]  Uh, I think all of them.
[1707.90s -> 1710.90s]  I think every single one of the TF2 commentators right now
[1710.90s -> 1713.08s]  bring something to the table.
[1713.08s -> 1715.08s]  Guys like IRSnipeR, they're really skill-based.
[1715.08s -> 1717.08s]  They have really, really high-quality skill videos
[1717.08s -> 1719.38s]  where they kill a bunch of people.
[1719.38s -> 1721.38s]  Star is really relaxed. He's really easy to listen to.
[1721.38s -> 1723.38s]  He's really good on the ears.
[1723.38s -> 1725.62s]  Guys like Shibby are just hysterical. He's hilarious.
[1725.62s -> 1727.62s]  He's one of the funnier guys you could ever listen to.
[1727.62s -> 1729.62s]  Leptor is also in that category.
[1729.62s -> 1731.62s]  He's like funny, but he's skilled too,
[1731.62s -> 1733.99s]  so he's a good combination of both worlds.
[1733.99s -> 1735.99s]  And I really don't know what category I would fit into,
[1735.99s -> 1739.23s]  even if there is a category, but out of all those guys,
[1739.23s -> 1741.23s]  I think all of them bring something really, really good to the table.
[1741.23s -> 1743.23s]  And I think they're all good. I like them all.
[1743.23s -> 1747.37s]  How much meat do you eat with your hands?
[1747.37s -> 1750.82s]  Uh, none.
[1750.82s -> 1753.82s]  I don't really eat, like, bags of meat.
[1753.82s -> 1757.83s]  What is your favorite game of all time?
[1757.83s -> 1760.46s]  Easy question, easy answer.
[1760.46s -> 1762.63s]  Super Mario RPG.
[1762.63s -> 1764.81s]  Definitely the best game of all time, in my opinion.
[1764.81s -> 1766.81s]  Below that, it's probably Diablo 2.
[1766.81s -> 1769.81s]  Soon to be Diablo 3, I'm hoping.
[1769.81s -> 1773.29s]  And then below that, number 3 is probably...
[1773.29s -> 1775.66s]  You guys are gonna hate me.
[1775.66s -> 1777.90s]  World of Warcraft.
[1777.90s -> 1779.90s]  Wait, before you freak out,
[1779.90s -> 1784.07s]  the reason why World of Warcraft is in my top 3 favorite games of all time
[1784.07s -> 1787.07s]  is because the sheer amount of time I put into that game.
[1787.07s -> 1792.89s]  I put hundreds, thousands, thousands, and thousands of hours into World of Warcraft.
[1792.89s -> 1794.89s]  I don't play it anymore.
[1794.89s -> 1796.89s]  I haven't played World of Warcraft in probably a year.
[1796.89s -> 1799.06s]  And I'd never plan on going back.
[1799.06s -> 1801.06s]  I'm done with it. It's over.
[1801.06s -> 1805.06s]  But for a good six, five or six years, I was really, really into it.
[1805.06s -> 1807.06s]  Made a lot of friends on there.
[1807.06s -> 1809.06s]  Had a lot of good conversations, a lot of good raids.
[1809.06s -> 1811.50s]  It was a good time, so...
[1811.50s -> 1813.50s]  Do I think the game is the most fun, the most balanced, the most interesting?
[1813.50s -> 1817.50s]  No, but it's definitely the most social, and I had a lot of fun on it.
[1817.50s -> 1820.06s]  So that's probably why.
[1820.06s -> 1822.42s]  Where are you or your parents from?
[1822.42s -> 1824.42s]  I think that means... I think what he's asking is where...
[1824.42s -> 1826.79s]  What's your nationality? I think is what he's saying.
[1826.79s -> 1831.03s]  My nationality is half Irish, half Polish.
[1831.03s -> 1833.03s]  My father is from Ireland, and my...
[1833.03s -> 1835.03s]  No, he's not from Ireland, but...
[1835.03s -> 1839.58s]  My father is Irish, and my mother is Polish, so...
[1839.58s -> 1842.52s]  How many push-ups can you do?
[1842.52s -> 1846.95s]  I've never really tried to max out my push-ups, but...
[1846.95s -> 1853.19s]  Normally I do 60 in three sets, so I'll do one 20, 20, 20, and that's pretty much what I do for push-ups, so...
[1853.19s -> 1859.88s]  As the scout, do you have urges to smash relatives in the face with a metallic baseball bat?
[1859.88s -> 1861.88s]  And or drink hallucinogenic fizzy drinks?
[1861.88s -> 1864.44s]  All the time.
[1864.44s -> 1867.64s]  All the time.
[1867.64s -> 1869.64s]  Why make commentaries of Team Fortress 2?
[1869.64s -> 1877.34s]  Basically, Team Fortress 2 is one of the only games that I've been good enough at it,
[1877.34s -> 1879.34s]  where I could potentially join a competitive scene,
[1879.34s -> 1884.46s]  and I'm not really that good at most other games, I'm good at them,
[1884.46s -> 1888.46s]  but to the point where I could really be like a competitive, professional player,
[1888.46s -> 1890.70s]  I think Team Fortress 2 is the only game since...
[1890.70s -> 1896.00s]  I mean, there was a time in World of Warcraft where I played it for so long that I became very good at it,
[1896.00s -> 1902.54s]  but Team Fortress is definitely the only game where I have real professional competitive skills in,
[1902.54s -> 1904.54s]  and that's why I think it's my best game,
[1904.54s -> 1907.54s]  so I figured why not make commentaries on the game that you're good at, you know?
[1907.54s -> 1911.42s]  Time to wrap this up, guys, only one or two more questions, so...
[1911.42s -> 1915.42s]  Thank you all for putting your questions in, I'm sorry if I didn't answer your question,
[1915.42s -> 1921.42s]  just you gotta remember, you gotta realize there was about 150 questions that I had to answer or potentially answer,
[1921.42s -> 1926.42s]  and I didn't want this to go more than 30 or 40 minutes, cause people probably wouldn't even watch it, so...
[1926.42s -> 1930.42s]  I had to skim through, I had to cut the fat a little bit, so I'm sorry if your question did not get answered,
[1930.42s -> 1932.79s]  so let's wrap it up here.
[1932.79s -> 1936.44s]  Do you like Finnish people?
[1936.44s -> 1939.70s]  I don't have a problem with Finnish people, I...
[1939.70s -> 1943.70s]  They're just as good as anybody else, I think, there's nothing wrong with them.
[1943.70s -> 1949.86s]  What is your favorite element on the periodic table of elements?
[1949.86s -> 1952.30s]  Barium, baby, barium.
[1952.30s -> 1956.74s]  I don't even know what barium is or what it does, but barium.
[1956.74s -> 1962.17s]  That's gonna wrap it up, guys, thank you so much for inputting all your questions, it was a great time,
[1962.17s -> 1965.17s]  I'm so happy that you guys were that enthusiastic about it,
[1965.17s -> 1968.17s]  I didn't think I was gonna get more than maybe 30 or 40 questions,
[1968.17s -> 1971.17s]  because it is kinda tough to come up with a question for somebody,
[1971.17s -> 1974.17s]  so thank you all so much, there's a little bit of gameplay left,
[1974.17s -> 1978.17s]  some real funny stuff happens, I'm sorry that you guys couldn't see the whole event we had,
[1978.17s -> 1981.17s]  but like I said, it's just too long,
[1981.17s -> 1985.17s]  so enjoy the rest of it, and I'll see you guys next time, take care everybody.
[1985.17s -> 1988.86s]  No, throw it, throw your stupid jorati.
[1988.86s -> 1991.86s]  No, no, no, get this out of here, get that out of here.
[1991.86s -> 1994.16s]  Get the sentry out of here.
[1994.16s -> 1997.49s]  Alright, so ready?
[1997.49s -> 1999.49s]  Everyone line up, shoulder to shoulder.
[1999.49s -> 2002.50s]  Ready?
[2002.50s -> 2005.50s]  Three, two, one, let go!
[2010.90s -> 2015.90s]  Dude, I got killed before I could even throw my anything out there.
[2022.08s -> 2027.11s]  Hey, I'm some dude, can you pick people who aren't?
[2031.11s -> 2033.11s]  Alright, now this is free for all.
[2048.31s -> 2050.31s]  You just crushed him.
