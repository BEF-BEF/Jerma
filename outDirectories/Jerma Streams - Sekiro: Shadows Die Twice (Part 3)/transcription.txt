[1.53s -> 28.10s]  Hey, it's me, Jeffrey. Liar. What do you mean, liar? That scared me. Don't be scared. Hey,
[28.10s -> 39.40s]  Jeffrey. Jeffrey's the name of your cat. It's also the name of the Toys R Us giraffe.
[42.54s -> 46.06s]  Is the Toys R Us giraffe still in the commercials? Does Toys R Us still have commercials?
[46.78s -> 54.39s]  Or did they blow their entire advertising budget in like 96 and then just hope that
[54.39s -> 58.87s]  the 500 million dollars they spend every day on TV, people just remember who they are.
[67.35s -> 77.16s]  They're bankrupt. Well, looks like somebody had to grow up eventually. I don't want to grow up. I'm a
[77.16s -> 82.92s]  Toys R Us kid. Until the fucking tax man comes and the 400 franchises you have go under.
[83.56s -> 103.50s]  Gonna have to grow up. What's with all like the sad faces? You haven't even shopped there.
[103.50s -> 105.90s]  What was the last time you've been to Toys R Us? You haven't even probably seen the
[105.90s -> 117.59s]  inside of it. You probably never even google image searched Toys R Us. Makes me sad to
[117.59s -> 128.52s]  remember. Toy grocery store. I don't like this meme, Jeff. Bring back Jerma. All right.
[129.88s -> 153.62s]  All right, I'll be right back. Hey, guys. It's me, Jerma. I'm the friendly one.
[155.88s -> 168.22s]  That's a good coffee. Do a co-op stream with Jeffrey. Nah. We're gonna go back to Sekiro.
[168.78s -> 174.97s]  It took a couple days to get better. I was feeling, as you know from the last stream,
[174.97s -> 186.07s]  a little fucked up. A little under the weather. And I'm feeling a little better. So without further
[186.07s -> 191.66s]  ado, we're gonna pick up exactly where we left off. I haven't even opened the game,
[192.30s -> 204.74s]  which has been hard because I've really wanted to play. Kick the plebs out. What? Why? Oh,
[204.74s -> 214.50s]  you're talking about sub only. Do it. Wait. Easy. Hold on. Like we could wait a few minutes.
[216.31s -> 223.62s]  Doesn't have to be immediate sub only. He's gonna play terrible because it's been two
[223.62s -> 229.54s]  days. No, that's not true. I should do fairly well because I see it in real life. I picked up
[229.54s -> 235.86s]  a broom and I told Talix and Kim to both like throw shit at me and to both like come at me
[235.86s -> 239.14s]  with like all kinds of weapons and stuff. And I like was blocking them and parrying them.
[241.29s -> 246.39s]  So I've been in real life. I've been practicing. Yeah. Kim, like just pick up
[246.39s -> 250.58s]  that fucking phone and just throw it at me. I don't want it to just do it. I'm ready.
[251.58s -> 257.02s]  And then hit me right in the fucking mouth. Broke all my teeth. But you get good, right? I went
[257.02s -> 270.58s]  to the hospital. Got good. You know, got a $2,500 hospital bill. Got it. You know, let's go.
[275.30s -> 284.10s]  Sub only now. Not yet. Where even are we? So those of you that don't know, this is secure
[284.10s -> 290.47s]  row shadow stacked wise. Uh, we were going down through the sunken temple.
[291.11s -> 296.58s]  Let me just like remember the buttons. Hold on. Right trigger. Right trigger. Right trigger.
[297.22s -> 309.21s]  Oh yeah. Okay. Now I remember. I remember. So this is the sniper roost. Does this game have a
[309.21s -> 314.49s]  multiplayer? I don't know. It does not. There is no multiplayer in this game. No invasions. No.
[314.49s -> 323.02s]  Well, that's a lot of stuff over there. That's probably a trap though. Uh, let's just go get
[323.02s -> 331.18s]  it. Is it a trap? Oh, I can see that. Can I jump up there? No, no, no, no. Okay. Well,
[331.18s -> 333.82s]  now it's something we learned. We've, we've remembered that this forward momentum,
[335.43s -> 340.07s]  uh, this forward momentum in secure. All right. If I, if you jump, you kind of just jump forward.
[340.07s -> 345.32s]  That's not a death. Doesn't count. People are counting those. I want to make it very clear.
[345.32s -> 350.60s]  That's not a death. It takes away like 30%, 40% of your health bar. Not a death.
[353.80s -> 361.86s]  All right, let's just go. I hear something. I think I hear a goofball over here. Oh my God.
[361.86s -> 371.06s]  What the fuck is that? Okay. Well, it begins. That's like Wolverine. That's like they dug
[371.06s -> 378.41s]  up Wolverine a hundred years after he died. And this is probably a boss. Yep. Long arm centipede
[378.41s -> 395.69s]  giraffe. Okay. Nice to meet you. What is this name? What kind of name is this? Oh shit. It's
[395.69s -> 403.22s]  Jeffrey from Toys R Us. All right. So he's got one, two, three, four, two, three, four,
[403.22s -> 409.14s]  five, six. Is that all he does? Well, he's fucking relentless. That's for sure. All right.
[411.40s -> 427.45s]  So it's one, two, three, four. That face. Okay. I got it. That's a slash. I don't know.
[431.11s -> 434.63s]  So I got it. You just got to carry the fuck out of this guy. So we got a slash
[435.35s -> 442.84s]  and then we're just going to make it come in. One, two, three. See you later. One down.
[442.84s -> 454.49s]  No, I didn't get it. Okay. This one. What am I facing? What the fuck was that?
[454.57s -> 463.29s]  Why was I facing backwards? Oh my God. That was stupid. That was stupid. Why was my back turned?
[464.09s -> 491.53s]  I can get it right here. That was actually stupid. Again. Again. Dad, you're dead.
[492.17s -> 498.12s]  Okay. That was fucking dumb. I had my back to him. Like he was just hitting me right in the
[498.12s -> 512.22s]  ass. Anyways, he's dead. Yellow gunpowder. Sick. I gotta get that mouse off the screen.
[513.18s -> 523.85s]  Oh, he beat Jeffrey first try. Yeah. Back to the bankruptcy board with you, Jeffrey. That's,
[523.85s -> 529.58s]  I'm not saying that. That's like not nice. So this is a prosthetic tool upgrades. Prayer beads.
[537.16s -> 544.10s]  Nice. Oh, that was fun. He was fairly easy. Not, well, the easy is the wrong term. Fairly
[544.10s -> 557.19s]  predictably. Just the same kind of chain. Some scrap. Nice. A large fan. A large fan
[557.19s -> 563.18s]  made of dyed red Japanese Aralia leaves can be fit into the prosthetic tool. Fanning it creates
[563.18s -> 572.07s]  a large vortex of wind. Spiriting away those it catches. Okay. So it was like a little knockback
[572.07s -> 587.11s]  or something. That's probably a knockback. Can I look in here? Gun for shrine key. All right.
[587.11s -> 594.33s]  So that's just like a little mini boss in front of them. There was a place to go down
[594.33s -> 603.86s]  here. I don't want to start a new area until, there we go. Yellow gunpowder. More
[603.86s -> 614.49s]  upgrade materials. I still have a little bit of a cough, so you're going to hear it a few times.
[619.14s -> 624.06s]  All right. Well, there's no reason why I wouldn't just refill my shit, right?
[624.06s -> 646.20s]  He's not going to respawn. Okay. I got my recoveries back. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. All right.
[647.00s -> 660.82s]  Sunken Valley passage. We have nothing over here. Now everybody, now don't get too excited.
[660.82s -> 664.18s]  Don't get too excited, everybody. Because I saw the trailer for the game.
[664.82s -> 667.94s]  And unfortunately, if you see a trailer for a video game, you're spoiled at the fact that
[667.94s -> 672.33s]  the giant snake is going to come up here and attack me right now. I did see the trailer.
[672.33s -> 685.30s]  I told you. I saw the trailer. I saw the trailer in the game. Why did I watch the trailer?
[686.02s -> 709.22s]  How do I get out of here? I'm assuming this way. It was part of like the E3 presentation.
[709.22s -> 724.39s]  And like I, I knew what was going to happen. Fight this now? Boat kick for spoilers.
[725.19s -> 734.47s]  Is it a spoiler? If two years ago they showed that. Oh Jesus. He's right here.
[742.12s -> 746.63s]  All right. I'm sorry. Let me apologize because I'm realizing something right now.
[747.19s -> 752.87s]  Like I saw the movie. You got, some of you guys may not have seen the movie.
[752.87s -> 758.79s]  So we were both watching infinity war right there. And right before like the big climax,
[758.79s -> 763.06s]  I told you what happened. Hey, did I, I've seen this movie before? Have you seen this movie?
[763.06s -> 766.58s]  No, I haven't. Oh, well dude, uh, watch what happens when, uh, when he gets killed right here.
[767.54s -> 773.77s]  Oh, okay. Yeah, it was cool. Huh? Did you like it? Yeah, I guess I did.
[781.18s -> 783.90s]  Vote kick. You can't vote kick me on my own damn. All right. But there's something
[783.90s -> 791.03s]  going on here. What do I, can I like slash him through here? Can I kill this thing?
[792.82s -> 804.81s]  Uh, what's wrong with him? Can I jump up on his body?
[805.61s -> 818.47s]  I mean, that's very clearly making a bridge. All right. I gotta get to his
[818.55s -> 825.37s]  plant. Oh shit. He's staring at me. Is there anywhere I can grapple to over here?
[825.37s -> 836.52s]  Looking for a grapple point so I can at least make my way up on him
[837.16s -> 849.86s]  because I can't grab him. I wonder if he's going to attack me from here.
[851.67s -> 871.16s]  Okay. So he's just set up for me to walk on it. Well, I made it. Oh, hey, by the way,
[871.16s -> 874.92s]  I watched a walkthrough up here. Just wait till I split his whole body in half. I do
[874.92s -> 879.80s]  this thing where I jump and it's a really farm software really over did themselves here.
[879.80s -> 884.92s]  You jump and you hold the sword out through his mouth and you zipline down his whole body
[884.92s -> 888.68s]  to be able to traverse the gap there and you cut the whole body in half while you
[888.68s -> 909.66s]  zipline down through his whole body. I think we just go up, right? Item.
[909.66s -> 920.30s]  Adamantiaite scrap. You're a jerk. This is, this is the cool part right here.
[926.17s -> 947.90s]  What I remember for the trailer. Oh, oh, almost. Uh, any more like monkeys that jump
[947.90s -> 958.92s]  down. I guess I have to jump for, wait, somebody can see me. He doesn't, he can't get up here,
[958.92s -> 976.10s]  right? I highly doubt he can. Can he? I don't think it matters. He has a gun. Okay. Well,
[976.10s -> 989.16s]  that's great to know. Not going to happen. All right. So from here, I need to drop down
[989.16s -> 1002.42s]  there. Do a monkey voice. I don't have any monkey voices. There's an item over there.
[1002.50s -> 1035.19s]  I'm going to get that. Do it. I, no, I can't. You literally can. You happy? There's an item
[1035.19s -> 1044.46s]  down here, right? Where was that item? I saw it from far away. Uh-huh. Oh, YouTuber reactions.
[1046.01s -> 1059.64s]  Whoa. Whoa. Oh shoot, guys. Shoot. Well, I got more snap seeds. Probably going to need them.
[1059.64s -> 1070.49s]  Can you not swear? No, I'm a swearer. Sorry, guys. I say like poop.
[1072.71s -> 1096.58s]  Shit. No, I think he's starting to run out of content. Just the fuck up one. All right. Down
[1096.58s -> 1105.27s]  or up? Ooh, I don't, let's go down. There's actually a, can I get back up if I go down
[1105.27s -> 1126.34s]  here? Let's see. Oh shit. There's like three in here. I think. Yep. Oh boy. Oh, you do a
[1126.34s -> 1138.82s]  lot of damage too. Jesus. Oh Jesus. Get me out. Okay. Here comes one that actually,
[1142.90s -> 1157.13s]  this is a really bad place to fight anyone. God damn it. I have like firecrackers. What the
[1157.13s -> 1177.03s]  fuck am I doing? I just forget. Wow. That's the easiest way to get rid of them. Damn. All
[1177.03s -> 1195.16s]  right. What the fuck? Okay. This is the surprise level. Contact medicine, weak poison
[1195.16s -> 1226.74s]  status have been inflicted. Okay. Yeah. Where? Okay. Back it up. All right. Where are they? I
[1226.74s -> 1237.46s]  don't even know where they're all coming from. There is an item here though. I think.
[1238.26s -> 1253.82s]  Think. No, I think it was just the spirit emblems. I might be missing things.
[1254.70s -> 1283.16s]  Nope. It's right there. There's actually two. One down here. Sugar. I hear movement. That
[1283.16s -> 1292.02s]  better not be what I think it is. I see green. I got a story for you guys. By the way,
[1292.02s -> 1300.68s]  this is a true story. This happened last night. Do you want to hear something fucking insane?
[1301.24s -> 1306.87s]  So me and Kim have been sick, right? And the reason why I'm looking at down is because
[1306.87s -> 1310.63s]  it reminds me of ecto cooler. And if that, but let me just finish my last statement.
[1310.63s -> 1315.75s]  If that's a poison swamp, this is the worst game ever made. So let's just be clear on
[1315.75s -> 1322.44s]  that. Uh, but anyways, so last night, Kim and I were in bed and we're doing our usual
[1322.44s -> 1327.88s]  ritual where we just sit there and look on our iPads, iPhones, just watching random videos.
[1327.88s -> 1332.12s]  We kind of just like at a certain point, stop talking and just read and look at stuff,
[1332.12s -> 1340.63s]  right? Like good night. Good night. Okay. Yeah. So I was watching a video of this guy
[1340.63s -> 1343.43s]  because I don't know. I sometimes I get on a kick where I just want to see like things
[1343.43s -> 1348.87s]  from the eighties and old sixties commercials and well, ecto cooler. Let me read about
[1348.87s -> 1353.35s]  that. That sounds cool. And I got on a kick on the ecto cooler from high sea, which is the
[1353.35s -> 1359.19s]  ghost busters tie in, right? I just was looking at stuff about it. So there's a guy on YouTube
[1359.19s -> 1364.06s]  that had one from 30 years ago and he was going to drink it. He's like, Oh, I got a
[1364.06s -> 1369.50s]  found one. It was original packaging. It's been expired for 30 years. And he opens it up and
[1369.50s -> 1373.02s]  he starts talking about it. And the whole time I'm just paying attention to it. And Kim's
[1373.02s -> 1376.78s]  watching whatever she's watching, look, you know, looking the other way. So he eventually
[1376.78s -> 1384.04s]  gets it into a glass and he drinks it. And instantly, not even five seconds goes by,
[1384.12s -> 1388.92s]  he fucking pukes projectile throw up coming out of his mouth. And I was like, Oh, that's
[1388.92s -> 1394.97s]  fucked up. Kim looks over, sees the prop, the puke coming out of his mouth. First time
[1394.97s -> 1398.81s]  she's paid attention to anything I've been doing in probably two hours. She has an
[1398.81s -> 1404.49s]  immediate reflex. If Kim sees another person like throw up, she has an immediate throw up
[1404.49s -> 1411.13s]  reflex. So she fucking sprints to the bathroom, all puking like, and I'm laughing
[1411.13s -> 1414.41s]  my ass off. I can't fucking believe it. Like that, that's, that's the shit that she caught
[1414.41s -> 1418.97s]  me watching like an ecto cooler video. So I'm laughing. Remember, I have a cough. I
[1418.97s -> 1424.09s]  start coughing uncontrollably. I'm in pain, laughing hysterically while I hear her fucking
[1424.09s -> 1430.01s]  like puking in the toilet. I can't help it anymore. I am in a full coughing fit.
[1430.01s -> 1436.41s]  I get the fuck out of bed. I go over to the sink and I start fucking puking in the
[1436.41s -> 1443.61s]  sink. I'm not kidding. This is a real fucking story. And I was still laughing.
[1443.61s -> 1458.39s]  So it was like, this is a real story. This is 100% true. I thought italics was good. I think he
[1458.39s -> 1463.56s]  was still streaming at the time. This was at like two, three, four, like the clock in the
[1463.56s -> 1468.60s]  morning. He was still live. So he didn't hear us. I thought we were going to wake him up
[1468.60s -> 1475.43s]  and he was going to think we were fucking dying in here. I, that is fucking real.
[1478.30s -> 1482.70s]  I didn't puke that much though. It wasn't like a full puke. It was like
[1487.46s -> 1496.52s]  funny. It was the fucking funniest thing all year. I think Star made this comment before
[1497.78s -> 1504.18s]  and I adhere to it completely. He said, he said in the past, I wish if I could go back and have
[1504.18s -> 1511.21s]  like HD cameras record something in my life, I would want it to be X, right? If there was
[1511.21s -> 1515.61s]  like two or three cameras in the bathroom and like in the bedroom and stuff, I would love to
[1515.61s -> 1527.32s]  see that footage. The whole thing play up. That's so many. Oh my God.
[1533.45s -> 1537.45s]  You're not supposed to fight those. You're not supposed to fight those monkeys over here.
[1537.45s -> 1544.44s]  Nope. That's a joke how many there are. How am I supposed to get over there?
[1545.70s -> 1549.30s]  I have to climb. I have to go across this way. There's no way you're going to make that.
[1550.34s -> 1567.91s]  Oh Jesus. What the hell you were doing? Just firecracker them.
[1569.19s -> 1587.48s]  Oh, this is going to be a death here. God damn it. I'll try. I'll try. All right. I'm going in.
[1587.48s -> 1589.72s]  Not yet. Wait, wait, wait. Let me just get like the item that's over here.
[1593.90s -> 1597.42s]  There's like shit. Okay. This shit like over. No, there's not. I'm already good to go.
[1601.54s -> 1625.32s]  Three, two, one. I'm going to get so many points for this. I can't, I can't call you
[1625.32s -> 1663.11s]  right now. This is not even hard. This is not even fun. I don't even want to do this
[1663.11s -> 1686.52s]  anymore. All right. They're getting me close. Hey, in Sekiro. This is a from software game.
[1686.52s -> 1697.72s]  You either die or you don't die. I'm sorry. How much money was that? Wow. Nothing actually.
[1697.72s -> 1713.58s]  They get monkey booze. I got monkey booze. Okay. A bunch of community subs came in and
[1713.58s -> 1720.57s]  I missed them. My phone was ringing. Community subs came in and I had to fight like 15 monkeys.
[1720.57s -> 1724.04s]  More than that. How many community subs just came in? I didn't see.
[1724.76s -> 1736.87s]  It was like at least five to ten, right? Five, five. All right. Awesome.
[1737.43s -> 1740.92s]  This Jerma lied about Minecraft VR. Thank you so much, dude.
[1742.47s -> 1749.78s]  More community subs from Jerma lied about Minecraft VR. I kind of like this area.
[1749.78s -> 1753.22s]  Until I look, until that's a poison swamp. And if it is, then you know,
[1753.22s -> 1766.58s]  that's two fold letter grades down. If this game is at an A right now,
[1766.58s -> 1773.72s]  that makes it a C minus. Oh shit. Okay. There's an idol there,
[1777.35s -> 1790.07s]  but points can be added back up. You know what I mean? I'm going to get this first in case I
[1790.07s -> 1796.34s]  can't get back up. Well, that looks like a big, that's a mini boss probably.
[1808.63s -> 1815.08s]  I crashed your computer by killing the monkeys. No, I didn't. I'm still waiting for one more
[1815.08s -> 1820.47s]  to get this because that's a pretty big deal. I don't have enough of that. All right. Let me
[1820.47s -> 1834.66s]  go look and see what's down here. There's an item down this way. Balloon of soul. Yeah,
[1834.66s -> 1844.60s]  that's, that's a, that's a green swamp. All right. Let's try to fight this. See,
[1845.56s -> 1852.82s]  thankfully this run back is pretty easy. It's just right here. Let me just get that
[1852.82s -> 1878.58s]  little health back. All right. Here we go. Just checking. Just checking. He's huge. Well,
[1878.58s -> 1886.22s]  I'm already seeing that there's a lot of things to grab onto here. How did you even
[1886.22s -> 1906.98s]  see me? Jesus. You have to fly around here. He's trying to see what it does. What about this?
[1907.78s -> 1921.11s]  It's affected a lot by that. Sweep. It is. I'm assuming it's a lot of sweeps. Whoa, that hurts.
[1923.90s -> 1940.10s]  Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Here's a run in. Oh shit. Oh, that's
[1940.10s -> 1951.78s]  a blow. That's an instant kill. All right. Whoa. I don't even know. I don't think you
[1951.78s -> 1984.12s]  can dodge it. Do I have to deflect that shit? Maybe. Oh, he's shitting in his hand. All right.
[1985.05s -> 2011.29s]  That's what that is. It's hard to get that. It's all right. This thing where he spins around
[2011.85s -> 2020.52s]  and like whizzes around and shit. You can't go in, but he does that. Okay.
[2023.83s -> 2046.47s]  Can't follow that up. Oh, he comes out of that quick. I don't have any heal. Oh boy. Oh
[2046.47s -> 2052.23s]  boy. Where was he going? He's going to shit at me. Okay. You can, you can block it.
[2052.23s -> 2078.01s]  One down here. Oh, that's not it. That was a grab. Whoa. All right. He did like four sweeps
[2078.01s -> 2099.11s]  in a row and it went for a grab. Sounds about right. Let's go again. I'm going to get in there
[2099.11s -> 2123.38s]  quick. Try to get a couple hits on him now. Never mind. What does that wiggle look like?
[2123.38s -> 2132.78s]  Fuck. I didn't block it. Fuck. No, not already. I don't think I should be parrying him. He
[2132.86s -> 2156.01s]  does a ton of posture damage. Like almost unrelenting. Give me help. Oh fuck. It's okay.
[2157.13s -> 2172.98s]  I got to use these more wisely. That's like, that's the key here. Oh fuck. He's like
[2173.62s -> 2198.10s]  stunned. Damn. I got to block that poison thing. He's around. He comes again.
[2200.78s -> 2225.48s]  Comes to shit. I'm like waiting for it. That's what I wanted to do. All right. All
[2225.48s -> 2232.68s]  right. Easy. Easy. That's the grab. Oh, that sucks. It's so hard to determine. No.
[2233.48s -> 2251.67s]  Again. No, that was a sweep. Shitting. Oh, there it is again. My God. That's what that's
[2251.67s -> 2269.32s]  good for. He does like a little shimmy. Damn. Oh, that like symbol and into the moves. It's
[2269.32s -> 2278.31s]  like the hardest thing to get on in this game because your brain sees the symbol and then you
[2278.55s -> 2286.34s]  kind of just panic for a second and go, which one is it? Which one is it? I'll get him this time.
[2298.58s -> 2309.53s]  What? What the hell? I just wasted two somehow. I got to be closer to that.
[2310.25s -> 2354.71s]  I think I'm just going to jump every time. Wiggle. Wiggle. Wiggle. To cool down. Fuck.
[2367.00s -> 2405.34s]  Oh, that hurts. Oh God. What's he doing? Easy. Here comes the poop. Here comes the poop.
[2414.41s -> 2457.11s]  Fucking camera. Please don't do this to me, camera. This time. He hasn't done shit at all.
[2458.07s -> 2486.86s]  Eat it. Easy. Back it up. Don't get greedy. Damn it. Not close enough.
[2487.98s -> 2509.03s]  What am I? Oh, he shit on me. Oh no. This is bad. Hold on. What the fuck? What? What's
[2509.03s -> 2534.94s]  going on here? Use. I can't use this? That was weird. All right. Come on. Back it up. Back
[2534.94s -> 2595.08s]  it up. Too much. Back it up. What do you got? Oh, don't get greedy. Fuck. Here comes the shit.
[2601.32s -> 2605.59s]  Fuck. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. I got two resurrects here. I got it.
[2609.82s -> 2615.90s]  Oh my God. I thought that was going to stun him or something. Oh fuck. Oh my God. Oh,
[2615.90s -> 2618.86s]  why did I do that? I had, I've like, I thought it was going to like get hit.
[2623.75s -> 2629.03s]  Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. For some reason, I thought when you latch onto them,
[2629.03s -> 2635.93s]  you have like immunity or something. No, I don't have any pellets either. I gotta get this on the
[2635.93s -> 2645.75s]  bar. Fuck man. That was close. Yeah, I have no pellets. Get that on the bar. Damn it. That
[2645.75s -> 2662.95s]  was close. Anything else I need? Maybe it might be worth putting one of these on here.
[2663.67s -> 2685.27s]  I want posture. Posture. Fuck. So this is the poison one. Man, I'm so like riled up right
[2685.27s -> 2695.02s]  now too. Damn it. That was so close. I need to take like a sip. I'm like a lightning rod right
[2695.02s -> 2715.48s]  now. Damn it. I thought that was the one too. It's all right. Let's go. I'll tell you,
[2715.48s -> 2718.12s]  the first two firecrackers, remember how they didn't land for some reason?
[2719.22s -> 2724.18s]  I feel like that's a victory right there. That was, you know, but whatever. I can't be mad
[2724.18s -> 2743.56s]  about that. I really wish I could attach. Let's see. No, god damn it. That's bad. This is a bad
[2743.56s -> 2757.19s]  start. Really bad start. Yeah, this is an awful start. Kill me. I'm gonna do it. That was just
[2757.19s -> 2770.52s]  a bad start. Hey Magellan, thanks for the five community subs. Magellan, 36. Five subs. Thank
[2770.52s -> 2790.23s]  you. I gotta land all of them. I don't need to, I can just get a couple in here. I don't need
[2790.23s -> 2807.74s]  to do anything. Save the shit when I need it. Get away from that poison. Take the shit.
[2808.62s -> 2832.92s]  Okay, when he throws the shit, I got at least two hits there. I can do it. Here comes. Get away
[2832.92s -> 2889.45s]  from him. Oh baby. Oh baby. Come on. That's a grab. Uh oh. Bad. Bad. Bad. Very bad.
[2892.22s -> 2899.54s]  Oh that's what? That's a grab too? I thought that was a sweep. Oh no. Oh no.
[2902.38s -> 2910.10s]  That's, that sucks man. Like seriously. It's all right. That just wasted like three. That sucks.
[2911.22s -> 2917.21s]  It's so hard to tell what the fuck he's gonna do. Yeah, this is a really good start too.
[2917.21s -> 2944.94s]  That's unfortunate. I still can do it. Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle. Let's just get it. Let's get a
[2944.94s -> 2992.22s]  short thing. Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle. All right. Let's go. Don't do it. Don't
[2992.22s -> 3018.46s]  do it. I got, I got, I got it. This is it. This is it. It's done. Goodbye. Right in the heart.
[3031.72s -> 3040.33s]  All right. Damn. That was fun though. Oh no. Of course not. Yeah. Welcome to From Software.
[3050.62s -> 3058.02s]  Oh great. I got to learn a whole new fucking move set now. Well this is fucking fun.
[3058.82s -> 3070.28s]  I don't even know what that is. I can't even scare him. What? Is that a jump? Um.
[3075.21s -> 3091.94s]  Well this is interesting. I mean you spend the whole time trying to figure out. Now I
[3091.94s -> 3119.45s]  got to fight another boss. Oh this is great. Oh no. Someone's rotting. Well this um. Hey is
[3119.45s -> 3124.49s]  this a From Software game that was made after 2016? Every boss has two or three phases.
[3125.05s -> 3145.66s]  I should be aware of that now. Fuck. Okay. I wonder what the tactic is after he's dead.
[3146.38s -> 3219.82s]  You really can't take that much damage here then. What? Where are you going? Back up.
[3219.82s -> 3226.58s]  Oh god. Not the camera. Not the camera. Not the camera. Just use one of these now.
[3240.89s -> 3296.23s]  Damn it. No. That's bad. Not that bad though. The wiggle. Asshole. Come on. He's gonna throw.
[3328.71s -> 3333.66s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me. That was absolute dog shit. Like give me a break.
[3334.22s -> 3343.03s]  Are you serious? Really? Dodge grabs. Except when you can't. I did that. I timed that so
[3343.03s -> 3369.34s]  perfectly. I did. Give me a break. Now he's doing this every single time. His fucking move
[3369.34s -> 3405.13s]  set changed since the last time I fought him. I'm not locked on anymore for some reason. Why?
[3411.66s -> 3415.74s]  I'm gonna get the fuck away. You know what I mean? Like there's no reason to do that.
[3423.64s -> 3447.61s]  Fucking Jesus. How are you supposed to beat this second phase? Why? Can you do it? Why is
[3447.61s -> 3468.54s]  that not hitting him? What the fuck? Give me a break. What? I feel like I'm gonna be here
[3468.54s -> 3512.17s]  for a while. I'm trying to figure out if his ass is more horrible or his head.
[3512.17s -> 3541.38s]  I've been hitting his ass. He can stagger a little bit in the head. It seems his head is
[3541.38s -> 3579.58s]  staggered. Not so much his ass. Dodge frames. I can't. No. God damn it. I might stop drinking.
[3580.46s -> 3609.56s]  I'm still alive. This is insane. The fact that you gotta do this twice with a move
[3609.56s -> 3613.32s]  set I've only seen one time. I'll be here for the next three straight days.
[3614.12s -> 3639.75s]  What the hell happened there? You gotta get the free tap there. You have to on his head. You can
[3639.75s -> 3670.17s]  get it. That's what I'm doing. I'm trying to jump fast enough. No. I think it was just so
[3670.17s -> 3674.33s]  debilitating seeing that I had to fight. I like drained a bunch of energy and now I gotta
[3674.33s -> 3685.80s]  fight this. Oh fuck me. This is gonna be horrible. Whatever. I'll do it. Let me put
[3685.80s -> 3701.18s]  it on. Let me go into my inventory because I feel like this shit is worthless. So maybe like
[3702.34s -> 3716.79s]  fire the axe maybe? I wonder. When he goes down try to get a hit on his ass or his face maybe.
[3717.43s -> 3722.55s]  I could try to poison him too. We'll see. We'll try the fire.
[3737.48s -> 3759.32s]  Wait for the first wiggle and see what happens. The worst part about that is I can't do the
[3759.32s -> 3773.08s]  follow-up. He's apparently too big. Burning? How long is he on fire for? That's actually not too
[3773.08s -> 3780.49s]  bad. It really isn't. Just gotta hit it like a couple times after he just wiggle wiggle.
[3781.13s -> 3812.26s]  Like here. Ready? Then get it. There it is. Now that's it. It's actually very effective.
[3812.82s -> 3830.57s]  I gotta get out of the corner man. The camera's gonna possibly... I gotta stop
[3830.57s -> 3860.20s]  dodging that. It's impossible to dodge it. I have to walk into the jump. Come on. Let me
[3860.20s -> 3896.57s]  see it again. Like even me. Like really? Why is this still a problem?
[3901.61s -> 3930.58s]  Why does it have to still be an issue? Like after 15 years? Still. He's gonna throw shit.
[3931.70s -> 3964.09s]  Alright guys. We get to see the second phase again. Are you ready? I'm excited.
[3964.97s -> 3976.07s]  Can I still hurt him? Come on let me do like damage to him now.
[3976.79s -> 4013.43s]  I don't... Oh fuck. How do I get rid of terror? I'm gonna use that but hold on. What's the terror
[4013.43s -> 4034.98s]  one? This one right? Oh man. I don't know what the fuck he's doing. It was a sweep.
[4035.78s -> 4077.34s]  I don't fucking get it. I don't... I'm gonna try again. Man it's so awkward. Jesus.
[4078.22s -> 4094.97s]  What am I doing? What? That takes so long. That takes forever. That takes forever.
[4095.93s -> 4101.93s]  Why would you ever have that? That... oh I'm gonna do a little stance now and pray.
[4102.89s -> 4123.90s]  I don't have any healing. This is fucking insane. Holy shit. It's just... it's fighting just
[4123.90s -> 4127.66s]  two bosses back to back that are not completely different from each other.
[4128.46s -> 4134.73s]  You gotta fight the the ape and then you gotta fight the headless horseman with a sword.
[4137.48s -> 4145.59s]  My goodness this is fucking crazy. They're not fucking around. It took until like the Dark Souls
[4145.59s -> 4158.89s]  3 DLC before you got a boss like this. All right let's see. Oil, fire. I feel like I should...
[4158.89s -> 4166.22s]  I'm gonna like waste these here. This dude is a full-on wall. Uh well I need... I'm just gonna
[4166.22s -> 4169.58s]  go in the inventory and take these because the game pauses and having too much shit on my
[4169.58s -> 4194.42s]  bar always fucks me up. Let me see how this goes. Let me see how oil works on them.
[4195.14s -> 4201.29s]  There are hooks all around for the scream. Yeah but it happens so quickly that it's almost difficult
[4201.29s -> 4206.01s]  to kind of rip the camera and like find a tree. He knocks the trees down too doesn't he?
[4206.97s -> 4210.90s]  Just kind of have to turn and just do it. Man. All right here we go.
[4211.78s -> 4230.18s]  Fight over his head. Covered. Wiggle. I'm just gonna see if he's done anything.
[4231.22s -> 4246.31s]  Okay he's only gonna do it once. He's covered in oil. One thing I don't know about oil,
[4246.31s -> 4250.86s]  does oil have to be applied every time? Or is it just on him? That's unreliable.
[4252.62s -> 4284.41s]  Nah that's very unreliable. You gotta get like the perfect opportunity. Don't do it.
[4284.41s -> 4338.18s]  Oh that was enough. No don't do it. Is it enough? In the corner. Wiggle wiggle.
[4338.74s -> 4351.86s]  Burn him. Oh right let me do it twice. Shit. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good.
[4352.74s -> 4387.77s]  All right here comes the shit. Missed. All right five heals. Let's go. Come on.
[4388.65s -> 4395.86s]  Bring this fucking giant Donkey Kong asshole into the grave. All right here we go. Wait wait wait
[4395.86s -> 4399.46s]  wait wait wait wait wait. Let's make this quick. Let's let's get some shit like okay done.
[4399.46s -> 4406.58s]  Pacifying agent. And I think I'm gonna take like a cookie here. I don't know.
[4406.58s -> 4411.94s]  I think I'm just gonna. How long do these last? Attack power. Vitality damage.
[4411.94s -> 4431.64s]  What do these fucking things do? They last for like 15 seconds. It's not long enough.
[4433.78s -> 4439.16s]  I'll wait till he gets up and I'm gonna do. Ah fuck. Shit.
[4441.16s -> 4451.08s]  I gotta get a plan here. I'm gonna use a. Okay I don't know. I'm gonna use the.
[4451.08s -> 4463.85s]  I'm just going in hard. You ready? No. Vitality damage. No. No take it off. Take.
[4464.49s -> 4472.63s]  I'm already panicking. Okay I'm gonna take this one. This one. Attack sugar. Let's go.
[4473.51s -> 4494.38s]  Here we go. Go. Mistake. Mistake. Mistakes. What the fuck is that move?
[4502.02s -> 4513.40s]  What do I do? What do I do? Oh my god. I can't see the water is fucking me up.
[4514.28s -> 4566.04s]  No. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. All right. What happened? What the fuck is going on? I don't.
[4566.12s -> 4641.58s]  Ah fuck. Jesus. No. No. There's no. That fucking camera man. You see what I'm talking about?
[4641.58s -> 4647.75s]  Give me a break. That's so hard to do that. It's so difficult to find a little spot.
[4648.39s -> 4663.80s]  It really is. It's fucking ridiculous. See? Like where the fuck can I even grab from here?
[4664.52s -> 4672.22s]  I don't even want to get close to him. One more of those and I'm fucking dead.
[4673.02s -> 4696.84s]  I'm gonna stay near like a tree. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.
[4732.68s -> 4756.87s]  Fuck. Nah fuck. That was a different combo. Okay come on. I got this shit. Let's go. Oh no.
[4758.79s -> 4784.18s]  Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out.
[4814.09s -> 4832.71s]  Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Oh shit. I don't know where to go.
[4833.35s -> 4857.08s]  I have to take it. Damn it. This is insane. Oh no. This is so. I had it too. It's just so awkward.
[4857.08s -> 4869.18s]  And I got no more pacifying agents. Oh my god. He's incredibly fucking difficult.
[4870.47s -> 4878.26s]  God damn it. Oh I have no more. God damn it. You can hold run. I know it's just it's so.
[4878.26s -> 4884.04s]  I just. It's it's real easy to say. Oh you can just do this. You can just do that.
[4884.04s -> 4887.24s]  When you're in the fucking driver's seat. When you're in the. When you're piling the airplane.
[4887.96s -> 4900.12s]  It's a lot harder. A lot easier said than done. Do this shit again. I feel like I was
[4900.12s -> 4909.38s]  fighting him in that other phase for like fucking 45 minutes. Bad run already. Nah kill me. This
[4909.38s -> 4932.66s]  is bad already. Just kill me. I had it too. So close. You just gotta. You gotta parry that
[4932.66s -> 4938.74s]  string when he's in that second phase. Those weird awkward thrusting. And then he does the
[4938.74s -> 4944.42s]  big one overhead. And then you get the free hits. But fuck man. You gotta do that so many times.
[4944.42s -> 4953.32s]  I feel like I'm not even doing any damage to him. Out of pacifying agent. I'm gonna have to buy some.
[4959.77s -> 4972.50s]  I really think I might have to start drinking. It'll like loosen me up a little I think.
[4973.06s -> 4980.58s]  Because right now I'm like. I'm like fucking tilted right now. I'm not even angry. Just
[4980.58s -> 4995.99s]  like fuck man. Everything's gonna be so perfect. Nah yeah. I don't know guys.
[4996.95s -> 5001.67s]  I might have to take a second here. I've been here for like 45 straight minutes.
[5006.54s -> 5025.96s]  I feel like I have to beat him here though. Man oh man. Man oh man. Man okay. I gotta just be
[5025.96s -> 5039.13s]  clean. Alright if I die again I'm going. I'm popping the bottle of wine. And if I beat him
[5039.13s -> 5052.41s]  I'm popping the bottle of wine anyway. For victory. Alright just be easy. Play it smart.
[5052.41s -> 5083.78s]  I know all his moves at this point. And shake. You can hit him so many times with fire.
[5086.39s -> 5107.66s]  What apparently. Every single one of them. Like somewhere underneath.
[5108.38s -> 5136.68s]  Now hit him right like a sack. If I get there with at least like three or four.
[5137.72s -> 5144.41s]  And I got like the dodge frame. Why even have a dodge? Why even tell me to dodge grabs when
[5144.41s -> 5152.44s]  there's eye frames for dodging grabs is like there's none. Why even have that tutorial?
[5152.44s -> 5177.02s]  We'll be here for the next six hours. I feel weak. I feel like I should be doing more damage
[5177.02s -> 5182.38s]  to him or something. The second phase I was hitting so many times. I feel so fucking weak
[5182.38s -> 5227.91s]  right now. Should take a minute. Should. I didn't. Fuck you. That like 180 degree
[5227.91s -> 5241.21s]  insta turn into grab. I thought that leaf was a person. And I was like how did somebody get
[5241.21s -> 5258.97s]  down here? I got one healing potion left. This is gonna be bad. I just gotta parry everything
[5258.97s -> 5271.46s]  and then run away. No healing potions. No pacifying agents. Just parry everything and run.
[5272.82s -> 5285.93s]  I'm gonna try. Sugar. Sugar doesn't seem to last long enough to. Alright here we go. Oh no
[5285.93s -> 5290.49s]  I forgot. It's okay. I don't know why I didn't get hit by that. He stopped mid swinging. Did
[5290.49s -> 5296.71s]  you see that? That was really weird. He was doing his like animation here and just decided
[5296.71s -> 5332.87s]  to do something else. That's without the good view of that. It's hard dude. I gotta get out
[5332.87s -> 5346.18s]  of here. What the hell was that? Here comes a big sweep. I'm so afraid of this terror thing
[5346.18s -> 5353.93s]  at this point. I tried to hit. I tried to grapple it and you see how it happened.
[5353.93s -> 5361.64s]  Thing in the top right. I was gonna do it. Just act out of frame. You can hear me pressing
[5361.64s -> 5420.58s]  the buttons here. Trees down too. Oh I'm too scared to fucking do anything man.
[5421.62s -> 5469.06s]  I'll do it. I don't care if it takes me 30 minutes. What? I don't know. Oh shit.
[5476.62s -> 5511.93s]  Calm down. What the fuck. Okay that's it. It's all sweeps. If you missed the first one
[5511.93s -> 5516.25s]  that's such a weird little place to go. He does a little turn and if he missed the first
[5516.25s -> 5522.78s]  one you're fucked. You gotta be close before you get him. This just takes forever.
[5527.83s -> 5553.43s]  You can do four. You can do four. That's a bad. That's a mistake. Don't do it like that.
[5554.07s -> 5575.70s]  Coming up. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Whoa he stopped mid animation you asshole.
[5577.37s -> 5597.94s]  What a dick. Fucker that was so ridiculous. Sometimes he changes that combo in the middle.
[5599.16s -> 5601.80s]  I am gonna have to tell you guys something here right now okay.
[5602.68s -> 5651.45s]  I'm ready to take this. I'm ready to take this. In fact I'm ready to take this. Bring it up.
[5659.94s -> 5665.19s]  That's positioning. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.
[5665.99s -> 5735.35s]  Oh my god I fucked it up over here. It's time. It's time to take it. He doesn't.
[5767.14s -> 5772.31s]  Kill him. Kill him please. Take the worm out.
[5772.95s -> 5783.00s]  Don't get up again. He better not get up again. If he gets up again I'm quitting the game.
[5783.64s -> 5793.82s]  I heard the scream. Oh my god that was fucking ridiculous.
[5794.62s -> 5798.54s]  When they throw the second phase shit at you. You just. You gotta redo the whole. You gotta
[5798.54s -> 5811.10s]  relearn the whole fight twice. Hey I told you. Win or lose. How many attempts was that? That
[5811.10s -> 5825.66s]  was a lot of attempts. Slender finger. Empty the cupboards. It's time for a glass of wine.
[5827.48s -> 5831.56s]  So the slender finger of a young woman can be fitted to the prosthetic to create a prosthetic
[5831.56s -> 5838.76s]  tool. Found in the belly of the guardian ape it is partially digested. There's a shinobi
[5838.76s -> 5845.13s]  technique called the finger whistle that can drive beasts wild. The one he used it before
[5845.13s -> 5851.86s]  clearly used it for this purpose as evidenced by the finger's open hole. And let's read the.
[5851.86s -> 5861.27s]  Okay now I can do what I wanted to do. Oh man that shit is fucking. That's fucking crazy.
[5861.99s -> 5874.28s]  I want to read the uh thing that I just got. Where is it? There it is. The battle memory of
[5874.28s -> 5879.62s]  an extraordinary foe lingering in the mind of the wolf. Commune to the sculptors and confront
[5879.62s -> 5882.66s]  memories of battle to permanently increase attack power. The guardian ape was defeated
[5882.66s -> 5887.38s]  though its roar can still be heard. It is said that an infested body marks the undying.
[5889.94s -> 5905.62s]  Oh boy. Enhance attack power. Let's go. But such a long life would surely be quite
[5905.62s -> 5909.46s]  lonesome for even an ape. Perhaps the echoing roar of the guardian ape was in fact
[5909.46s -> 5923.67s]  a solicitation of sorts. Sweat check? I'm not wearing any clothes. I'll put a t-shirt on and
[5923.67s -> 5927.51s]  I'll get the bottle of wine though. I don't even. Do I have a blind opener? I don't think
[5927.51s -> 5938.47s]  I even do. I've not had a blind opener since moving to this place. All right there it is
[5938.47s -> 5954.02s]  finally. Recovers vitality upon performing a successful death blow. Uh yeah now we're in
[5954.02s -> 5964.98s]  business. I still do want this and I got these two. I think I want these as well.
[5965.78s -> 5973.66s]  Your face can't be on the entire time. All right hold on. I'll be right back.
[5973.66s -> 6195.21s]  Let me let me go see how hard this is going to be to do. Honest to god
[6195.21s -> 6200.09s]  I will never understand why I am the way that I am. You know I sometimes just think
[6200.09s -> 6206.33s]  about that. There are like four bottles of wine in this house. There's no way to open them.
[6207.50s -> 6214.68s]  I just keep adding to my collection. Oh that sounds good. They've corked. I can't open them.
[6214.68s -> 6225.77s]  I never get a wine opener. I just keep adding to my pantry of wines. I can't you can't use a
[6225.77s -> 6231.46s]  knife. I'll be able to fuck it up. But it's all right. We'll do the next best thing.
[6231.46s -> 6239.02s]  That's a cider. So here we go. Cheers everybody. Turn on the camera like 30 seconds.
[6239.10s -> 6257.08s]  But cameras aren't plugged. Who did this? I didn't do this.
[6257.08s -> 6271.22s]  Somebody came in here and did this. I didn't do it. Is this it?
[6280.70s -> 6288.46s]  What where did this magically disappear? Where's the USB plug for this? What the what?
[6290.26s -> 6308.63s]  It's just gone. I don't ever have a computer. Ever. Only read newspapers,
[6308.63s -> 6334.04s]  do crosswords, and use your phone. All right here we go. Hi guys. Cheers everybody.
[6334.04s -> 6351.00s]  This is cider. Ew. That was fucking insane. This game's crazy. Drinking at four o'clock
[6351.00s -> 6355.32s]  in the afternoon. It's five o'clock in the afternoon. Therefore it's legal. It's legal
[6355.32s -> 6369.29s]  now. I can do it now. I need a minute after that. I need to go on like a light jog
[6369.29s -> 6374.39s]  after that one. What's wrong with your sideburns? They're always fucked up. I have
[6374.39s -> 6387.90s]  like a misshapen face. So they're never gonna be correct. Sorry. It's pretty good. No wine
[6387.90s -> 6402.07s]  though. I can't have I can't have wine. I look lovely. Thank you. What's going on here?
[6402.79s -> 6410.09s]  What's going on here? Okay I thought hair just fell out but it was actually on the screen.
[6410.09s -> 6414.70s]  Why don't you do face cam? Always have face cam on. Dude you'll get like more viewers.
[6422.36s -> 6449.30s]  That's why we turned it off. All right back to the game. So who's my favorite boss so
[6449.30s -> 6454.22s]  far? Uh for those of you that have gotten this far and played this far probably uh
[6454.22s -> 6461.86s]  Genichiro. That one felt the most uh I felt that that one was the most involved for me.
[6462.58s -> 6473.06s]  A giant gorilla throwing shit at you and I mean this was cool. All right I'm thinking
[6473.06s -> 6483.66s]  ready. Typical typical Saul's camera right guys? Oh look at that. Sorry. Complain,
[6483.66s -> 6486.38s]  complain, complain. All right can I ask you guys how many of you guys have watched
[6487.18s -> 6498.07s]  other streamers play uh this game? Maybe a bunch of you? What what's percentage wise? Okay let's say
[6498.07s -> 6503.70s]  well not percentage but where do I fit in like the streamer complains about the video game
[6503.70s -> 6509.22s]  and is like angry at the video game? Where do I sit there? You know let's say one is
[6509.78s -> 6514.82s]  streamer didn't do it at all and ten is streamer is so obnoxious with how much they're
[6514.82s -> 6520.54s]  talking about how the game's not good and how it's the game is hard and it's too hard
[6521.10s -> 6525.26s]  and I hate this game it's stupid the mechanics are dumb. Like where do I sit there?
[6530.76s -> 6537.58s]  The four? About a four? All right I'm all right with the four.
[6543.46s -> 6549.78s]  Keep me honest though if I get over a five if we get to like six territory you guys got to
[6549.78s -> 6557.85s]  let me know. I don't want I don't want to get to six territory. Get it off the screen!
[6563.90s -> 6567.82s]  All right a white lotus flower found blooming in the depths of the sunken valley where
[6567.82s -> 6571.82s]  the fountain had waters pooled deeply. The flower's aroma attracts female apes.
[6572.38s -> 6576.30s]  Thus the guardian ape carefully tended it to it so as to offer it to his bride.
[6577.27s -> 6581.19s]  One of the incense ingredients sought by the divine air for immortal separates. That's kind
[6581.19s -> 6591.72s]  of sad. Well I have the lotus. I can now go talk to the kid and we can continue to progress.
[6592.44s -> 6601.19s]  Nothing up there right? How could you? Well I needed his soul. I needed increased attack power.
[6601.83s -> 6605.70s]  Look he is he was like suffering down here for like 4 000 years.
[6607.29s -> 6610.65s]  But wait don't ever just leave an area without checking.
[6611.29s -> 6628.47s]  You know there could be something over here. Nothing? Really?
[6634.86s -> 6655.11s]  What's wrong with some of you guys? Um let's just go back. Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.
[6656.47s -> 6671.22s]  Thank you for the five community subs. Again thank you. Coming in with the five subs.
[6671.22s -> 6676.17s]  All right so I got the flower now. I have to go put the flower.
[6678.52s -> 6682.76s]  Talk to the kid. He's in the library right? Is he still in here? I got the flower!
[6683.48s -> 6695.51s]  I procured the flower for the was it truly blooming in the sunken valley yeah deep within the
[6695.51s -> 6702.07s]  valley so that is where the fountain had waters pulled deeply he's done well to acquire this
[6702.07s -> 6709.45s]  wolf oh and actually i found something i discovered there's another scent we need another one what
[6709.45s -> 6716.17s]  is it the blood of the divine air of the dragon's heritage in other words my blood
[6717.61s -> 6718.65s]  what i gotta kill him
[6723.11s -> 6726.68s]  whoa i just like fucking went down in my seat however
[6726.68s -> 6733.46s]  in the world can you walk this thing i found a curious journal belonging to lord tecaru's page
[6733.46s -> 6739.94s]  and it appears there is a way for me to bleed for now i'd like to ask you to keep this for me
[6739.94s -> 6745.94s]  here we go page's diary an old diary entry written by tecaru's page lord tecaro held his
[6745.94s -> 6751.62s]  arm over the incense burner and attempted to cut it with a sword but incredibly his wound healed
[6751.62s -> 6758.60s]  instantly and not a drop of blood was shed lady tomo said without it your blood cannot be spilled
[6758.60s -> 6764.36s]  what could she be referring to i wonder now then we just need to figure out how to make
[6764.36s -> 6771.48s]  me bleed perhaps we should ask lady emma let me ask you this she should have much knowledge
[6771.48s -> 6789.80s]  do you bleed let me ask you this do you believe let me ask you this superman do you believe i gotta
[6789.80s -> 6809.34s]  get it right let me ask you something superman do you believe perfect emma emma emma there is
[6810.22s -> 6814.78s]  i'm reaching a six at last like what the sakura tree behind the castle
[6817.10s -> 6823.66s]  it is a sakura tree that lord tecaru brought from his homeland so it's a sakura tree from
[6823.66s -> 6831.50s]  the divine realm yes it's quite a mysterious one is that it was constantly in bloom even
[6831.50s -> 6842.73s]  outside of spring poison swamp town oh i can't wait why there was a person who cut off branch
[6842.81s -> 6859.21s]  and took flowers from he stole it without the everblossom there oh i have the monkey drink
[6859.21s -> 6871.59s]  right there was a dragon rod epidemic in ashina what every single person i see it was the title
[6871.59s -> 6883.77s]  of the stream i don't remember what it was i can't see it from here has alleviated this regret
[6883.77s -> 6893.88s]  oh right right right i mean that's kind of true all right so we're going to poison swamp
[6894.90s -> 6907.96s]  can't wait anything else i can do what do i have for uh lady emma about the sakura tree what
[6907.96s -> 6914.58s]  she said the tree is called an everblossom lord tecaru brought it here from the divine realm
[6914.58s -> 6919.78s]  but it has withered away i wonder if i should give the prosthetic guy the monkey booze however
[6919.78s -> 6926.55s]  it is said that someone plucked a branch from the everblossom and stole off with it who would
[6926.55s -> 6933.99s]  do such a thing some fucking loser what's lost is lost finding a stolen tree branch
[6934.71s -> 6941.35s]  we have no information to go on let us gather what we can for the aroma first as you wish
[6941.35s -> 6952.23s]  nice whatever you fucking lose oh why doesn't the souls team make like a boston guy for like
[6952.79s -> 6961.10s]  never mind i gotta dial the weird back a little bit uh okay well let's go back to where
[6961.10s -> 6977.98s]  we were so this is let's just go back to the watering hole and go up from there drunk off
[6977.98s -> 6986.26s]  of one cider i've had a sip and a half of cider logically speaking and scientifically speaking
[6986.82s -> 6998.50s]  what you are describing is not possible okay it's not physically possible can i get back
[6998.50s -> 7011.46s]  up it's this way right can't get up there we'll just go to the isn't there an idol

[7058.54s -> 7067.38s]  yeah it's a poison swamp they i don't know why they keep making these at this point it's
[7067.78s -> 7078.97s]  it's an inside joke right it's a joke this is them just making a joke there's no way that
[7078.97s -> 7093.83s]  they do this again this is specifically to make people like me angry why really we've done this
[7093.83s -> 7103.00s]  like six times the sludge you can't go that fast poison like they okay hold on it you then
[7103.00s -> 7110.94s]  they've done fire level lava level they've done ice level poison level too much why don't

[7423.62s -> 7429.53s]  saw me play through that any item that looks even remotely useful i can't use it because
[7429.53s -> 7442.06s]  it's so useful that i don't want it to use i don't want to use it it's too useful okay so
[7442.86s -> 7456.22s]  where do i go from here this way i guess we're gonna wrap around here it's not useful when you
[7456.22s -> 7460.78s]  don't do anything when it does nothing i know it's bad i agree with you completely
[7461.34s -> 7484.52s]  it looks like we're going that way give me up okay oh something over here npc maybe or

[7524.41s -> 7532.20s]  uh yellow gunpowder that i got green mossy gourd refills upon rest
[7533.45s -> 7538.17s]  it doesn't heal poison status it reduces poison build-up and increases poison resistance

[8257.67s -> 8285.19s]  i can go over here which doesn't look like it huh i guess i have to go to snake i thought
[8285.19s -> 8293.62s]  maybe there'd be a way to go down here i don't think there's any other way to go
[8299.56s -> 8308.04s]  no snake it is apparently or did i open i don't think i opened up in the area after the gorilla
[8315.19s -> 8318.81s]  um hold on oh no no no i don't want to fight this guy
[8322.28s -> 8355.91s]  so the snake but snake instantly kills me and then i'll reach this i'm just gonna bond

[8425.14s -> 8429.86s]  whistle's location by locking onto a target only the targeted enemy will hear the whistle
[8432.46s -> 8443.10s]  i can't be like enrages beasts making them unable to discern between friend and foe

[9623.78s -> 9637.61s]  required to pay money to me you know i say i say a lot but seriously that's a big posture break

[9938.58s -> 9954.50s]  missing because i can't go from here to there there was a wall behind the mini boss yeah but
[9954.50s -> 9961.18s]  it looked like it was a little too high for me to get over there am i crazy i guess not okay
[9961.82s -> 9972.44s]  i thought there was a wall to try to jump up okay well uh this definitely leads to
[9972.44s -> 9986.36s]  around the corner holy shit comedy chat man i gave another 50 dollars what if i said i won
[9986.36s -> 9998.76s]  this with max bet uh look so that hey that's on you to decide i'm not gonna tell you not

[10035.75s -> 10044.12s]  this they're not going to play that same card twice why would they do that that it
[10044.12s -> 10061.78s]  makes no sense i just need to prove to myself this is like a scripted moment i'm not gonna
[10061.78s -> 10064.50s]  jump down here and like the snake's gonna eat them or something or they're gonna get a fight

[10163.77s -> 10168.60s]  because you can just jump and run straight right i would assume this is probably the better one to
[10168.60s -> 10189.93s]  do because it is just just jump off because this is holy shit more money another 50 bucks

[14557.75s -> 14573.75s]  vent then we can go through to loaded umbrella magnet when spread open it will protect against
[14573.75s -> 14578.63s]  attacks from all directions hold it out while moving to protect from light attacks as a
[14578.71s -> 14583.75s]  tempered magnetic shaft that makes it nearly unbreakable enemy attack can be deflected by
[14583.75s -> 14595.06s]  spinning the open umbrella all right well here's the fucking super one if it's a short range flame
[14595.06s -> 14598.82s]  blast continuous fire damage will inflict the burn status it is able to maintain a continuous
[14598.82s -> 14604.62s]  stream of flames due to the smoldering resonance side of the tube mechanism so i
[14604.62s -> 14610.55s]  just need money and then a few more well let's see yeah i need money and then a few more
[14610.55s -> 14628.38s]  those so i got a better flame vent i just need money that seems stupid how much money do i have

[14653.10s -> 14661.90s]  is the better umbrella that we got the flame vent which goes to golden vortex
[14662.54s -> 14680.68s]  jesus what do you mean na math it's 600 i'm talking about so i need three more black gun powder
[14680.68s -> 14687.64s]  and then look at this shit golden vortex a large and with a golden fan gather illustrious
[14687.64s -> 14691.32s]  golden wind and release it to force enemies caught in the vortex to face the other way
[14692.12s -> 14697.99s]  can be performed twice in a row enemies that have been turned around drop items or money
[14697.99s -> 14705.34s]  considered to be donations and this is the new umbrella when spread open it will protect
[14705.34s -> 14710.86s]  against attacks from all directions the blessing of the vermilion bird prevents damage from fire
[14710.86s -> 14718.74s]  and also prevents burn sounds kind of good all right so i need some more black gun powder

[14753.02s -> 14759.82s]  that's why we went to the valley to run to jump to clash swords where one slip would mean
[14759.82s -> 14766.14s]  your doom that was how we trained we came to move exactly as monkeys did after a time

[16767.05s -> 16785.59s]  seconds so that means every pool of water can now be oh man don't do this to me now i gotta
[16785.59s -> 16796.66s]  go check every pool of water camera's not that bad no it's not but in a game like this that
[16796.66s -> 16804.79s]  requires such pinpoint focus something like that can ruin an attempt like the camera going
[16804.79s -> 16810.17s]  like like zooming straight into the front of your face and you can't see the animations
[16810.17s -> 16813.90s]  they're doing you could that could ruin an entire attempt and then i would just complain
[16813.90s -> 16826.04s]  about it and i blame the camera good thing i didn't have to do that how would you have the
[16826.04s -> 16832.28s]  camera behind you in a corner spin around and show it from bird's eye serious have it come up
[16832.28s -> 16839.27s]  and have it be a bird's eye like isometric camera for like two seconds and spin in circles
[16847.22s -> 16854.33s]  i'm fucking kidding it's hard to do that it's you have a game engine right that's not easy
[16854.33s -> 16858.76s]  to do i don't know it isn't that doesn't mean i'm not going to complain about it
[16858.76s -> 16872.23s]  sometimes make the obstacles transparent has been a staple for years yeah i mean i guess you
[16872.23s -> 16877.51s]  could do a thing where like for instance like this if when the camera the camera could essentially
[16877.51s -> 16883.18s]  just i don't know how you would do it but because this sucks right it's too close and
[16883.18s -> 16885.90s]  if the guy's in front of me he's taking up the whole screen and it's like oh shit
[16887.66s -> 16903.13s]  so i'm gonna figure it out in like 100 years anyways that's fun that was a really
[16903.13s -> 16908.07s]  fun fight it was just you just that was all about this timing the parries and the sweeps
[16908.79s -> 16916.57s]  they had a couple that was a couple of fun fights in a row all right we've gone for it's
[16916.57s -> 16933.96s]  like an 86 now it's the flower in here what's it like being a las vegan i don't know what that
[16933.96s -> 16950.92s]  means is this another boss there it is a stone found in an altar deep within the village
[16950.92s -> 16954.28s]  of the water dwellers stones will sometimes appear in the bodies of those who have long
[16954.28s -> 16960.76s]  drank from the waters step into the marital stone and offer the fragment as versus stone
[16960.76s -> 16973.06s]  one of the incense ingredients stopped by the divine air for immortal severance so i have the
[16973.06s -> 16984.41s]  other ingredient what happened in here i like this area i'm supposed to i could have fought
[16984.41s -> 17009.86s]  that guy in here just checking just checking ape incoming yeah wouldn't that be something
[17010.50s -> 17014.12s]  if i had to fight the headless ape again all right i can just go back
[17014.92s -> 17039.21s]  because this is part of storyline quest item shit i think that's all i can do here something that
[17039.21s -> 17044.17s]  this game does that all the other ones that they've ever made don't do is a lot of the
[17045.29s -> 17050.81s]  mini boss mini boss boss they don't really give you any time at all all right what do you
[17050.81s -> 17076.68s]  think you got a second nope there's another fight i actually i like it though all right uh
[17076.68s -> 17111.99s]  this looks wrong wake him oh it's just you wolf i'm sorry i was asleep i got the other ingredient
[17112.63s -> 17118.15s]  look i found something that may help us it's a stone a stone i found that stone look at this
[17119.43s -> 17126.39s]  a fragrant stone enshrined in a village within the depths of the chino one must throw oneself

[17163.08s -> 17168.36s]  fucking dump that's all i remember in that case where was the wedding procession headed
[17168.36s -> 17176.86s]  no way to know i guess sweetly scented lord kuro that place might be the gateway to the
[17176.86s -> 17192.74s]  divine realm this is a nice length of game too because how long have i been streaming so
[17192.82s -> 17200.87s]  far i see you've gathered some of the ingredients needed to create the aroma of the fountain head

[21470.28s -> 21477.27s]  oh at this point i kind of just got you got to just go i gotta go i just have to i have to
[21477.27s -> 21498.09s]  get out of here there's too many people here there are too many of you here uh there's a
[21498.09s -> 21517.16s]  but that's this guy's gonna see me maybe not the door
[21530.97s -> 21591.54s]  touch it oh what is this oh no what did i just do i activated something i teleported somewhere
[21591.54s -> 21632.76s]  monkeys panels is empty it's dunston a five-pronged bell made of h bronze can be used repeatedly
[21633.72s -> 21639.98s]  when rung monkeys and wolves alike are returned to their initial states however a monkey caught
[21639.98s -> 21649.99s]  on the folding screen will not escape whether the bell is rung or not folding screen monkeys
[21651.37s -> 21698.20s]  folding screen monkeys uh where where what is it did do i just have it and i just have to
[21698.20s -> 21707.46s]  ring the bell near things or something elusive hall bell okay so then let me put it down here
[21708.18s -> 21717.91s]  monkeys and wolves are like a return to their initial states however a monkey caught in
[21717.91s -> 21738.31s]  the folding screen will not escape okay i yet another i believe you are on a mission
[21738.87s -> 21745.94s]  you wish to leave this place yes then you must defeat the monkeys depicted on the panels at
[21745.94s -> 21752.22s]  the whole entrance once you have done so the divine child's voice
[21755.80s -> 21765.90s]  the monkey purple kimono is the seeing monkey he has excellent eyesight can see great distances
[21766.78s -> 21775.83s]  and is very attentive if he spots you he will rock this exceedingly purple one
[21776.39s -> 21779.51s]  this runs and can see from a great distance over the orange one
[21783.24s -> 21788.84s]  while he does not have particularly good eyesight or hearing he makes a big fuss when
[21788.84s -> 21797.11s]  he sees a threat causing all the other monkeys to run oh perhaps he merely enjoys toying with
[21797.99s -> 21799.83s]  so kill orange one first
[21804.34s -> 21809.46s]  he has excellent hearing can hear across great distance hearing
[21812.52s -> 21814.44s]  he will generally run away
[21817.30s -> 21820.18s]  making it hard he is exceedingly
[21821.14s -> 21830.02s]  i do not wish to be it is usually quiet here which means it is near to nirvana in its own way
[21830.97s -> 21840.06s]  at least that is how it feels to me oh yes there was once someone who like you
[21840.86s -> 21851.29s]  a mission i believe he chased the monkeys for a while but everything here i pray that you
[21851.37s -> 21877.86s]  succeed uh okay okay okay there's the orange one orange and green do i do have to kill them
[21877.86s -> 21926.54s]  or do i need to just ring the bell near them uh well i'm gonna is he above me well there's
[21926.54s -> 21932.06s]  a bell here this is read this bell is deafening ringing it recklessly will also make your ears
[21932.06s -> 21959.05s]  ring which is the one that had bad hearing what green what i need to like can i talk to him again
[21959.05s -> 21976.76s]  green was purple is seeing okay orange is speaking bad eyesight and hearing
[21978.12s -> 21982.60s]  so orange is seeing green is hearing so the green one you can fuck up with the audio
[21983.16s -> 21997.29s]  can hear a few ways all right so green audio wants someone i believe what does this mean
[22000.86s -> 22009.00s]  no one can hear anything else in here so i'm gonna lure somebody in here lure the green one
[22009.00s -> 22021.13s]  in here i don't know how anything else to read so there's the waterfall room there's the bell
[22021.13s -> 22031.14s]  and then there's whatever this is bear flame in the wind when it goes out the place becomes
[22031.14s -> 22059.62s]  dark uh so the seeing monkey has to be killed in here let's see so it's dark in here now orange
[22059.62s -> 22076.89s]  is what the hell does this say the bottom cannot be seen above his darkness nothing can be seen
[22076.89s -> 22117.10s]  so the seeing monkey can get like pushed in here well there's the green one where does it
[22117.10s -> 22137.46s]  go where's the bell i can hear the monkey chase like running around but it's still i

[23422.15s -> 23427.91s]  i wish to obtain the dragon tears from the divine realm to sever the ties of immortality
[23427.91s -> 23434.47s]  i see i have read about this i have read there is a way to sever the dragon's heritage
[23436.94s -> 23443.18s]  which means the divine heir begrudges the power of the dragon's heritage that's right
[23443.18s -> 23449.58s]  go kill tutorial guy that's so mean i am one of the children of the rejuvenating waters
[23449.58s -> 23456.62s]  created by those who would stop at nothing to achieve immortality my false dragon's blood
[23457.18s -> 23466.62s]  was created by man children so there are many of you i am the only one who survived the process
[23466.62s -> 23473.42s]  the others are laid to i know of another one here i see i do not know if it is right to
[23473.42s -> 23480.46s]  sever the ties of immortality but the dragon's heritage undeniably corrupts the lives of men

[24732.55s -> 24741.91s]  father to think you were still alive that was my but the same could be said for you
[24741.91s -> 24750.81s]  i was certain you died the power of the divine heir brought me back that's it what the divine
[24750.97s -> 24762.57s]  heir the dragon's blood father now you see it remember the first rule of the code

[24863.26s -> 24881.32s]  gonna stay loyal not do as you ask a shinobi showing the likes of passion i said it that was
[24881.32s -> 24895.77s]  the point of the first options i got i said i was gonna be loyal miserable display why why
[24895.77s -> 24914.71s]  can't be determined by the individual this is what i've decided i'm so glad we got to come

[25332.04s -> 25333.08s]  gotta be an opening somewhere
[25336.84s -> 25343.67s]  i think it's just dancing around until he does that move and then getting the actual health
[25343.67s -> 25349.16s]  damage on him that's what i that's what i would say if i were a video gamer
[25376.42s -> 25387.85s]  there we go as long as that he wins the race just like the turtle
[25388.57s -> 25425.03s]  the same idea what's wrong with me i have a status effect problem what is this effect

[25951.91s -> 25972.17s]  fight let's use it the great shinobi owl's unbridled ambition was to obtain the power of

[26069.64s -> 26078.78s]  sometime i'd love and hate this game at the same time i love this game more than i hate it
[26078.78s -> 26093.08s]  you know that what all right the one bar the guy down with the magic shit that you can't dodge

[26124.79s -> 26129.59s]  mario tennis that guy just because i hated those mechanics that was almost mario tennis
[26129.59s -> 26142.42s]  that was like a seven and i it wasn't even i didn't even die that many times i died like
[26142.42s -> 26147.70s]  three or four times i don't know something about that encounter is mario mario tennising

[26168.94s -> 26174.14s]  the headless magician guy that just stands in this weird tiny little area that you can't
[26174.22s -> 26180.58s]  dodge and you have to coat your sword in magic and he's really slow and he can teleport behind
[26180.58s -> 26195.53s]  you that was close to about a seven in anger for me anyways uh let's get to the bits thanks
[26195.53s -> 26199.61s]  everybody for sticking around it was a shit load of money earlier too you guys are fucking
[26199.61s -> 26215.24s]  spoiling me but this game's really really fun it's essentially you're you're at a hundred
[26215.24s -> 26228.39s]  the whole game let's go back to about seven hours ago let's get this on the screen that
[26228.39s -> 26234.12s]  i can actually see what was a ten on the anger scale i don't think i've ever been a ten on
[26234.12s -> 26240.28s]  the anger scale on stream i think like seven six to seven is the highest i think i've ever been
[26240.28s -> 26248.58s]  actually on camera i don't think i've never been like a nine or a ten on stream i feel
[26248.58s -> 26253.70s]  like a nine or a ten on stream would be like me turning the stream off being so angry at
[26253.70s -> 26264.66s]  something that i've gotten bleeding that's probably what a ten is tennis that's probably
[26264.66s -> 26265.46s]  what a ten is
[26272.38s -> 26281.85s]  oh my goodness anyways let's uh go through these i know it's getting a little late so

[26368.10s -> 26373.46s]  channel on youtube daily english tv i was met with only sadness as the channel has deleted
[26373.46s -> 26381.83s]  all of their videos no longer may we talk about a lazy boy or wait why why would they
[26381.83s -> 26394.73s]  delete every one of their videos that's strange what they had like hundreds of thousands of videos

[26413.42s -> 26423.50s]  sort of small the dark souls 3 swamp area is so huge it's just gigantic you can actually
[26423.50s -> 26427.02s]  jump out of the poison i don't think i even got poisoned once in there so really not a big deal

[26791.16s -> 26796.60s]  than i was last time you streamed also i'm taking a voice acting class with chuck huber
[26797.56s -> 26805.26s]  known as android 17 from dbz etc that's pretty fucking cool i'm pretty happy about that i just
[26805.26s -> 26809.58s]  want to overcome and get out of my comfort zone of being embarrassed by my voice but
[26809.58s -> 26814.22s]  99 percent of people are too so i have to keep that in mind i always hope you are doing
[26814.22s -> 26822.71s]  well have a good night germa and chat you've already got a lot of knowledge from that so

[26849.59s -> 26873.94s]  the i lost it here what was it for the anger link here what is this i don't get it what is
[26873.94s -> 26881.27s]  it is that from office what is that did i say something like this like a few hours ago
[26881.91s -> 26888.89s]  hey pugatron thanks for the 10 bucks don't be angry germa i tried to eat it i really did but
[26888.89s -> 26899.96s]  i wasted items that i was just so upset by it i was so angry just seething at that guy with
[26899.96s -> 26904.65s]  no head it's a good thing i got out of there when i did it's a good thing that i have to
[26904.65s -> 26908.57s]  use items to fight that guy because if i had to stay there and fight that guy for like
[26908.57s -> 26913.86s]  another two hours what was the part when i said i was gonna throw my beer bottle behind
[26913.86s -> 26919.74s]  me as hard as i could was that the was it that guy wait no that happened before didn't
[26920.38s -> 26926.73s]  what fight was that oh that was the ape
[26932.26s -> 26935.75s]  so i did get kind of irritated today but it's just the nature of the game
[26936.31s -> 26941.67s]  i really hope i don't come off as like an asshole or like an obnoxious dick because
[26941.67s -> 26948.17s]  like i i hate thinking that that's happening because there's like angry there's like upset
[26948.73s -> 26957.14s]  and then you like start to crawl into like annoying where you're mad about something and
[26957.14s -> 26960.82s]  you keep talking about how mad you are about something you keep talking shit and then you
[26960.82s -> 26968.92s]  kind of trek into annoying so i hope i didn't trek that far but this game is really it'll
[26968.92s -> 26984.62s]  do it to you it will it just has that effect apologize to green monkey
[26988.39s -> 26994.36s]  hey dr pepper thanks for the 10 dollars there's more where that came from if you do a feed
[26994.36s -> 26999.32s]  cam i will never do a feed cam that's not gonna happen thank you for the 10 bucks though
[26999.32s -> 27008.41s]  that's not ever gonna happen uh internet Jorge thanks for the 15 bucks i've been stressed but
[27008.41s -> 27014.38s]  laughing with your laughing with you kills all the stress they say show love thank you internet
[27014.38s -> 27025.42s]  Jorge thanks for the 15 dollars it depends if you're actually critical of the game design
[27029.26s -> 27036.60s]  trust no one's got a new video i'm gonna queue this up i'll queue that up we'll watch
[27036.60s -> 27043.13s]  it right at the very end um yeah i don't like to be too critical of game design and
[27043.13s -> 27049.69s]  because i know that is it's you just get it rubs people's just the wrong way but in that little
[27049.69s -> 27061.19s]  zone with the no dodging i don't know if it's critical or if it's uh if it's just disappointment
[27061.85s -> 27067.94s]  that i couldn't move i don't know anger is a funny thing frustration is a frustration is a
[27067.94s -> 27074.23s]  funny thing because no matter what happens you are always going to try to find a way to
[27074.39s -> 27081.88s]  a way to relieve your frustration and sometimes that's just like talking shit just out loud
[27087.43s -> 27094.68s]  it's just salt yeah salt just it just happens and like i said there's a way to hopefully not
[27094.68s -> 27102.97s]  cross that threshold of salt into all right dude relax you're fucking irritating i really
[27102.97s -> 27114.34s]  hope i don't ever get there and if i do sorry that i did it is that kind of game

[27687.11s -> 27697.35s]  that i mean unless you like okay if if you like i've got an idea for a new series on nbc

[27706.06s -> 27711.02s]  stream clips up on like nbc at like eight o'clock prime time or something then it would kind of be
[27711.02s -> 27725.24s]  like all right um that's me any chance of you going back to hollow knight no probably not
[27726.82s -> 27732.90s]  probably not i keep hearing the idea in my brain to go play it again but i just don't think
