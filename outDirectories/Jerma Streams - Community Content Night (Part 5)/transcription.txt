[2.10s -> 12.74s]  Start breathing. I can't, guys, I can't hear him breathing. Is he there? Can anybody hear him breathe?
[12.74s -> 26.33s]  Oh, shit. Imagine if I, could you guys hear me breathing before? Could you guys hear me breathe?
[26.33s -> 33.10s]  No, no, no, okay. Somebody's asking, where are the Winx? Well, it's disabled for now,
[33.10s -> 39.82s]  because we're going to give a specific place at a specific time today to do them.
[42.01s -> 49.26s]  Winx are going to be, we're gonna, we're gonna sit here for a little while. Winx are going to be
[50.46s -> 62.97s]  like 75% off. What were they, 75? They'll probably be like 10 or like 15,000. I'm just
[62.97s -> 69.26s]  going to sit there and listen to some music at the end of the stream today for like 20 minutes
[69.98s -> 79.02s]  or so and just fucking wink into the camera, like a hundred times, and then they ain't ever coming
[79.02s -> 85.05s]  back. They're going to be gone forever. I'm going to fuck up his eyes. No, no, no, no, no,
[85.05s -> 95.82s]  don't worry. I put eye drops in. I'll be all right. I'm going to set up like a Mario coin noise.
[98.30s -> 101.90s]  We'll just play a coin every time one comes in. You know, like a prding!
[102.86s -> 111.05s]  Frashing the wink economy. Well, the wink, here's the thing. You should have sold Winx
[111.93s -> 119.40s]  a week ago, right? You shouldn't be buying Winx now. You knew that the store was closing.
[119.96s -> 125.64s]  You didn't know that. Was this not going to be a wink bounce? There's not going to be a bounce
[125.64s -> 137.34s]  back in price. The store is closing. But anyways, welcome to community content night. This is for
[137.34s -> 146.02s]  the month of January. I think January into the first little bit of February. There is a lot of
[146.02s -> 153.91s]  stuff and I have to determine how I want to continue doing community content night going forward
[155.03s -> 161.11s]  because it seems like we're always 30, 40 days behind, even when we do hundreds of pieces of
[161.11s -> 170.97s]  artwork and dozens and dozens and dozens of videos every time. So there's always so much stuff. I am
[171.53s -> 178.42s]  flabbergasted at the amount of artwork and videos and music that people give
[178.42s -> 186.81s]  to this community and especially these streams. So I got to try to figure out a solution to make
[186.81s -> 198.23s]  it so we're not constantly like five weeks behind no matter what. Instead of doing it once a month,
[198.23s -> 204.86s]  I might try to do something like this more than that or we'll have to put a like maybe like a
[205.58s -> 209.66s]  filter on the submissions or something. I haven't figured out what I want to do.
[209.66s -> 214.86s]  It's either reduce the amount of things you show on stream or do it way more often. And I'm not
[214.86s -> 235.78s]  sure which one of those I want to do every other hour. But here we are. Just tell people to stop
[235.78s -> 243.51s]  making content. Hey everybody, don't make anything anymore. But we can get started.
[247.62s -> 252.66s]  Do it quicker. Well, that's the thing. I don't want to have it get to a point where I'm just like
[252.66s -> 256.58s]  fanning out fucking artwork cards. Just like that one, that one, that one, that one, that one,
[256.58s -> 260.02s]  that one, that one, that one, that one, that one, that one. Those are all cool, right? All right,
[260.02s -> 262.74s]  next. What we got next? This one, that one, that one, this way, that way, this way.
[264.76s -> 282.07s]  That kind of defeats the purpose. But here we go. Is my camera on? I'm going to play some music.
[282.81s -> 288.76s]  Can you hear the music? I'm already, I got, I got the, oh by the way, sorry, I'm like 40 minutes
[288.76s -> 295.64s]  late. Listen, the reason why I'm 40 minutes late is because fucking daylight savings time
[295.64s -> 300.26s]  kicked in last night and I didn't even know. This is shit that I don't even pay attention to.
[300.90s -> 307.38s]  I don't pay attention. Daylight fucking savings time. No, I had no idea. So I woke up this morning
[307.38s -> 314.10s]  and had some stuff I had to do that it was like 11 45 before I started my day. It's like, okay,
[314.10s -> 318.54s]  cool. Thanks. I got out of the shower and I'm just looking at my phone like, wait, what? It's
[318.54s -> 326.20s]  fucking noon? How's that possible? I said that what we should do is, hold on, let's look, take
[326.20s -> 340.39s]  a look at this. First of all, yeah, this is Celeste OST. Turn it down a little bit. But yeah,
[340.39s -> 347.75s]  daylight savings time just fucking killed me. It was like, everybody loves going back,
[347.75s -> 352.79s]  but nobody likes going forward. But when you go forward, you're just adding the time from when
[352.79s -> 358.25s]  you've lost it. It's just like, I hate the bouncing back and forth. I'd rather just like,
[358.25s -> 362.90s]  can we just do 30 minutes permanently forward? Like, do we have to go back an hour and then
[362.98s -> 366.84s]  forward an hour? Like, why can't we just do like a permanent, like 20 minutes forward?
[366.84s -> 373.48s]  Like, could it be 20 minutes and like 20 back? Does it have to be a full hour? Why does it have
[373.48s -> 380.02s]  to be a full hour? Make it like, I know it's the, I know it's like the farming and you're trying to
[380.02s -> 385.72s]  get as much daylight as possible. I, I, I, I know, I know the theory. I know, I know the reasons.
[385.72s -> 398.14s]  It's not even for farming. It's not, it doesn't, that doesn't even matter anymore. Does it not?
[398.14s -> 405.91s]  Does that not even, what's going on with my fucking like weird bug hair? Oh, we're good.
[405.91s -> 410.54s]  Anyways, daylight savings time. This should be like a fucking, it should be on the news.
[410.54s -> 419.06s]  I like the, the space cats though. This is very pretty. It's going a little more.
[419.06s -> 429.56s]  It was to save, what was it? It was to save resources during World War II. It's useless now.
[429.56s -> 436.60s]  It was to save resources during World War II? That's not, is that not even, is that, am I,
[436.60s -> 443.42s]  that's not even true. That's fake. Did I, was it, did I just get like a, like a Facebook fucking
[443.42s -> 451.88s]  reblog of something that's not even real? This is beautiful though. Look at this dude. He boogie.
[451.88s -> 459.18s]  If Jerma looks at this, please DM me a clip on Discord. Oh, there you go. Let's get a DM.
[461.70s -> 469.61s]  Well, hold on. No, not all of you. Not, not all of you. This guy's fucking mentions are
[469.61s -> 491.82s]  going to blow the fuck up. Thanks for the fireman. I like all of us. Oh man. I, I, whatever. What am
[491.82s -> 498.63s]  I supposed to do? Be like, Hey, don't, don't do that. I just like to think about what I want
[498.63s -> 506.31s]  to do with fireman too. Fireman needs something. Fireman needs like his own merchandise. Like
[506.31s -> 516.49s]  people love fireman so much. Fireman accounts for at least 10 to 20%, maybe even more, like
[516.49s -> 523.85s]  30% of every submission. Like everybody loves this guy. I've got, I've got to, I've got to have
[523.85s -> 532.09s]  something. It's like, it would be like, why, why don't I not have anything? He's cool. He's,
[532.09s -> 540.58s]  he's really fucking cool. He's wicked cool. The jackbox shit got taken down. Yeah. I have to figure
[540.58s -> 550.92s]  out what I want to do. This is a Murius. This is me controlling Murius. I love Murius so much.
[550.92s -> 559.50s]  Every time I see a cow, it makes me happy. You get the eyes right too. That's the best part.
[560.38s -> 574.39s]  Like frog eyes. That's not, that's not the cow's name. The audio is out of sync. Can we,
[574.39s -> 580.31s]  do we still have to keep this joke on that? Like my audio doesn't match up. How long are we going
[580.31s -> 589.98s]  to keep this going? Is this the new, your mic is muted? Is this, Hey, your mic's muted. My mic's
[589.98s -> 600.36s]  muted? Oh, fuck. Is that the new mic muted? It is slightly delayed. That's not even possible.
[601.00s -> 619.26s]  This shit's not even possible. It's like 10 milliseconds. It's not even, it's impossible.
[619.26s -> 645.58s]  All right. Anyways, it's not, clip me this. I want to see. Uh, but this is beautiful though.
[645.58s -> 653.75s]  It's not even delayed. These people have this shit internet. What? Why did nobody clip? I just,
[653.75s -> 660.79s]  I specifically demanded that somebody clip. I specifically asked that somebody clip that.
[660.79s -> 676.68s]  Nobody clipped it. You, uh, this is, I was trying to figure out when there's another thing of what
[676.68s -> 683.02s]  to do about, uh, photo shops. There's a lot of photo shops that get put into the community content,
[683.02s -> 691.00s]  uh, discord. I'm trying to think like, should it, should it, should photo shops be allowed anymore?
[691.00s -> 701.99s]  Cause like, there's like hundreds of photo shops. Keep them, ban them, no. But some photos, this is
[701.99s -> 705.91s]  the thing. It's like, this is why it's hard to determine what's like, what should be on screen.
[705.91s -> 710.71s]  Cause some photo shops are just like, somebody took the squish tool and like dragged it across
[710.71s -> 714.92s]  the screen. And it's like, all right, dude, you just, you like did the squish tool and you just
[714.92s -> 723.05s]  like dragged it across my eyes and my nose and you hit export. And then some of them are very,
[723.05s -> 734.25s]  very well made. It's still art. Yeah. But just remove the bad ones. Well, that's the thought.
[734.25s -> 739.94s]  That's the idea is like, just slowly try to cut off, uh, have a filter at least somewhere. So it's
[739.94s -> 746.50s]  not just like 100% of everything gets put on the screen. I'm trying to figure it out. This is only
[746.58s -> 757.35s]  community content. Number five. I love, I love shitposts. I love shitposts, but you, but we,
[757.35s -> 761.11s]  should we just have like a shit? But no, we can't have a shitpost category because shitposts,
[761.11s -> 767.14s]  that could be everything. That could be literally anything. And if you have a shitpost category,
[767.14s -> 772.73s]  holy fuck that. You think that there's, there's, there's like a thousand submissions a month. Now
[772.73s -> 778.98s]  it will be like 5,000 shitposts a month as physically not even possible to show on stream.
[778.98s -> 787.53s]  It would be like, that's like two weeks of streams. Oh no, that would, that'd be impossible.
[787.53s -> 798.26s]  Electric skin plus glass body. He said he loves it. Do a shitpost week. Yeah. I can't just like
[798.26s -> 808.38s]  stream myself looking at shitposts. Electric skin. This is from, um, what's that Kingsway?
[808.38s -> 825.90s]  Is this Kingsway? Show your armpits. No. Get out of here. Please play Danganronpa. Some, uh,
[825.98s -> 835.88s]  Jerma Rumble fan art. And we got the pencil. Let's get a good zoom in here. I like this. I like the,
[835.88s -> 847.53s]  I like the bug guys. Do not play Danganronpa. Don't, don't worry. I'm not going to. Don't worry.
[847.53s -> 856.66s]  I'm not, I'm not going to play Danganronpa. I, like, I'm just not, I'm not going to. I fucking
[856.66s -> 864.50s]  hate the pencil. So do I. And I made him. That was the biggest mistake of my whole entire career.
[864.50s -> 870.22s]  Biggest mistake of my entire career was creating this character. Because the second that that,
[870.22s -> 873.58s]  that I made him and the second that that video went up, I was like, no,
[875.66s -> 886.31s]  no, that was a mistake to make him. But, uh, I, I, I, I, I'm breaking my rules saying I'll never
[886.31s -> 892.62s]  play something. That's not true. I might never play it. There's some more, uh, art. What's this?
[892.62s -> 906.01s]  Uh, spy crab. Pick dastardly Richard, glue man. This is year of the rat. That's true. It's like
[906.01s -> 928.30s]  a fireman rat. So what is next year? What's next year? The year of you're the fish rat too.
[928.30s -> 945.27s]  All right. You're a year of the rat too. You're actually you're on the fish. Is it the ox? I,
[945.27s -> 949.58s]  this one's here because I wanted to go over this because this is wrong. This is incredibly
[949.58s -> 957.42s]  inaccurate. That's been corrected. Um, health is actually at one at this point. I have one bar in
[957.42s -> 965.77s]  hell. DPS is probably somewhere around like somewhere around a yellow. I definitely not
[965.77s -> 983.35s]  red. Definitely not speed. Speed is app is, is speed is that fucking red. Did you see how you
[983.35s -> 990.17s]  couldn't even see how fast that was. That was too fast. The camera didn't pick it up. What fell the
[990.17s -> 997.85s]  we sensor bar. It's okay. That's made it a fucking plastic. Uh, defense is probably like a yellow
[1000.09s -> 1005.85s]  range is like a green. I mean, I'm, I don't have that much like, I don't have that much range.
[1006.41s -> 1009.93s]  I mean, I'll be honest with you. I do have, actually I kind of have long arms though.
[1010.81s -> 1018.79s]  I have really long fucking arms. I have like a short body and long arms and a long torso.
[1019.67s -> 1023.93s]  The only reason why I'm like just about five eight is because I have like this big ass like
[1023.93s -> 1034.44s]  swimmer's torso. So I got, I don't have long legs, but I got a long torso. He's lanky Kong.
[1035.40s -> 1040.12s]  Yeah. Lanky Kong. If lanky Kong was like five inches shorter than how big he is.
[1040.92s -> 1046.81s]  And I kind of have big hands too. Remember we talked about this. Like I've got big hands.
[1047.77s -> 1056.20s]  He has no grace. Yeah. But that thing, this is, this is definitely way up here. Lanky Kong is
[1056.20s -> 1065.24s]  not a red on speed. Lanky Kong is like a zero for speed, isn't he? You're like an alien. Yes,
[1065.24s -> 1070.98s]  I have an alien body. That's correct. I've got really wide shoulders, like a small waist, long
[1070.98s -> 1084.36s]  torso, like big fucking eyes. No, I don't. The Bostonian psycho. It's me with a Shido.
[1085.00s -> 1095.91s]  He has no style. He has no grace. This guy's got a funny face. Yeah. That means that's,
[1096.79s -> 1102.20s]  what else does it say about lanky Kong? What are the other lanky Kong lyrics?
[1107.22s -> 1115.78s]  This Kong is a fucking disgrace. That's not the lyrics. That's not the lyrics. It does not say
[1115.78s -> 1124.12s]  that. It doesn't. No, it doesn't say that. It doesn't say why. They wouldn't put that in a
[1124.12s -> 1134.10s]  kid's game. I like this one though, with my trusted friend Shido. It does say that. It does not say
[1134.10s -> 1143.03s]  that. I like the background. I like the, Jerma is doing a thing where he talks about art again,
[1143.03s -> 1147.67s]  where he's like, I like the background. I like how squishy it is. Like, I don't know what the
[1147.67s -> 1154.97s]  fuck I'm talking about. It didn't say fucking. No, it didn't. Why would it do that? I hate some rat.
[1154.97s -> 1169.77s]  It's like a bunny. It's a bunny rat. You got the facial hair, right? That's like, that's pristine.
[1169.77s -> 1179.88s]  Correct. I do, I even, I have hairs that grow up here. I really do. Can I even show this? Like,
[1179.88s -> 1185.30s]  I have hairs that like grow up here. You see that? There's like hair up here. Like, why is
[1185.30s -> 1199.35s]  their hair growing here? Like, why is that happening? You get a zit? One. One in 10 years.
[1199.35s -> 1212.26s]  Sorry. One zit in 10 years. Sorry, guys. Now, this, this is the thumbnail for a video
[1213.27s -> 1221.02s]  called the Speedy Grinner. The video, I think, has been DMCA takedown by this point.
[1221.02s -> 1228.62s]  So, if you are the owner and operator of the Speedy Grinner video, you're gonna have to
[1228.62s -> 1237.24s]  probably re-upload it because this was not available when I tried to click it. Stay. Stay.
[1241.30s -> 1251.51s]  Imagine taking down a Jerma video. Wait, is it, it's back up? Is it? Hold on. Let me get this. Is
[1251.51s -> 1260.78s]  this it? Alright, let me, hold on. Let me just get this added. Is this actually it or is this a
[1260.78s -> 1269.00s]  fucking gnome or something? Please tell me you guys aren't doing this to me right now. Let me
[1269.00s -> 1279.16s]  just check it. Click on the crosswalk. Why, why, why, click on crosswalk. Why does it, why does it,
[1279.16s -> 1286.98s]  I'm not a robot. Why does YouTube think I'm a robot now? Oh, the Speedy Grinner. There it is.
[1286.98s -> 1293.88s]  Alright. Yeah, no, it's real. Alright, let me just put this in the queue here. Probably just start
[1293.88s -> 1306.25s]  with that. It's easy just to put it there. Alright, back to what we were doing. There we go. This is
[1306.25s -> 1314.07s]  just, you know, a scary image of the guy that I get referred to a lot as, which is unfortunate
[1314.07s -> 1319.35s]  because I don't think I am this person at all. I think that I'm more of, you already know.
[1320.31s -> 1335.72s]  You guys know who I think that I am. My Marvel fursona. It's the Riddler. You have to be smart
[1335.72s -> 1339.56s]  to be the Riddler. You gotta be fucking, you know how I'm smart enough. You gotta be fucking smart.
[1340.52s -> 1351.56s]  If you keep cunning, dangerous, and with it, and this is a Joker. I'm doing a Joker.
[1356.12s -> 1365.18s]  I'm the Riddler. That's my, that's my Marvel fursona. I'm the Riddler. Punch, punch, defend,
[1365.18s -> 1378.63s]  break his legs. What is this from? Punch, punch, defend, break his legs. Oh, it's from Black and
[1378.63s -> 1399.22s]  White, right. Murius. Punch, punch, break his legs. What a psycho. I'm the Riddler. The Riddler's a
[1399.22s -> 1404.10s]  psycho too. If you do like a psycho-analytical on the Riddler, he's a, he's a, he's a psycho,
[1404.10s -> 1410.23s]  so that's fine. Jeremy Albertson. A stupid fucking production of some kind of currency thing.
[1410.79s -> 1419.90s]  Oh, a stupid fucking production. Stupid fuck. Stupid fucking goddamn. No, I gotta do the face too.
[1421.98s -> 1434.54s]  Wanna see an actor? Stupid fucking goddamn fucking thing. Stupid fucking goddamn fucking
[1434.54s -> 1445.72s]  piece of fucking shit. Stupid fucking thing. Fucking ridiculous. I'm not really bad. I mean,
[1446.36s -> 1455.67s]  I'm an actor. But I do. Some kind of currency thing. Uh, I got too scared of these to finish
[1455.67s -> 1477.51s]  them. Sincerely snoozing copter. Uh, I'm scared of these too. Yeah, these freak me out. The one in
[1477.51s -> 1487.27s]  the back is, no, this one right here. It's like Bilbo grab the ring vibes. I make the Bilbo grab
[1487.27s -> 1494.63s]  the ring fucking face all the time, don't I? Like, I can't even, I do that all the time.
[1494.63s -> 1504.50s]  Not even on purpose. That one looks real. It's not real. Uh, this is Jerma the cute goblin.
[1514.98s -> 1523.91s]  Okay, I thought these, I thought I had a bunch of earrings. Is this hair? It's the same face.
[1524.47s -> 1539.90s]  It's close. These need to be a little higher. No, my hair's too long. You can't even see it.
[1540.46s -> 1551.69s]  Pretty cool. Teeth, my, my teeth goblin. Oh, tooth goblin. Uh, you are fooled to believe
[1552.65s -> 1570.84s]  that I can be contained. Uh, are you going to grow mutton chops? You know, it might be kind of funny
[1570.84s -> 1577.38s]  for me to do that, but, uh, if I just shaved everything else and let this grow disgustingly,
[1578.34s -> 1587.10s]  um, I, my, my girlfriend would no longer touch me. Like, I'm just going to be honest with you.
[1588.41s -> 1594.01s]  If I did that and it was, it was these gross, big, long hairs here and it would be all fucked up and
[1594.01s -> 1600.54s]  all gross and disgusting. I, I, I, you're, you're, you're literally making me delete
[1601.26s -> 1617.96s]  my entire intimate life that I have with my girlfriend. So that's Wolverine appeal. No,
[1617.96s -> 1626.55s]  the appeal of Wolverine is nice. It's, it's thick and it's, it's there. And no, that's not the appeal
[1626.55s -> 1631.51s]  of Wolverine. The appeal of Wolverine, Wolverine's got fucking scissors that come out of his hands.
[1631.51s -> 1640.39s]  What are you talking about? You get rid of the scissors on his hands and his healing capability
[1640.39s -> 1659.42s]  and he's just a guy on the subway. It's not, oh, Wolverine has that. He can do 600 sit-ups.
[1659.42s -> 1664.36s]  Yeah, because while he's doing the sit-ups, his body is, he's tearing his muscles up and their
[1664.36s -> 1670.87s]  body, they're healing instantly. Wolverine could spend a day, a full day at the gym and do every
[1670.87s -> 1677.99s]  single body group three times. Jealous. Check his hair. Check hair. What, what, like, what is it
[1677.99s -> 1681.35s]  going to be like fucking clean in here? Like, what do you think it was? Check your hair.
[1681.35s -> 1687.93s]  It's cool. I don't agree. I just took a shower fucking like three, four hours ago or something,
[1687.93s -> 1693.29s]  whatever it was at 11 45. I remember because I was pissed about daylight savings time. It's
[1693.29s -> 1708.86s]  done greasy lice. I had to include this one because it's fucking funny. Well, I don't even
[1708.86s -> 1716.94s]  remember what this is from, but I mean, it's, that's very, very, very fun. I remember that
[1716.94s -> 1722.28s]  somebody made this within 10 seconds. It's from rhythm heaven. Oh, that was a fucked up stream.
[1722.28s -> 1731.56s]  That was a weird one. It was like normal. Rhythm heaven was very normal and fun for about four and
[1731.56s -> 1740.41s]  a half hours. And then it turned into this shit. It was a ton. I had a bunch of fun, but like I,
[1740.41s -> 1754.02s]  I wasn't doing this in the first four or five hours. Uh, this is from the FTK stream King
[1754.02s -> 1758.50s]  Jermo, which by the way, people have been looking for an update on that. Uh, there's currently an
[1758.50s -> 1763.08s]  FTK part two that's in development right now. It is not even going to be remotely close to the way
[1763.08s -> 1769.93s]  that it was before. It's going to be very, very, very different, way different than what you,
[1769.93s -> 1777.05s]  what you experienced last time. We are changing it completely. We're going to try it. It's still
[1777.05s -> 1785.83s]  going to be a Minecraft, but the whole idea is going to be a lot more, um, planned and stuck to
[1785.83s -> 1797.58s]  do. So there will be at least one more of these scripted content. No, I mean, just planned,
[1797.58s -> 1803.10s]  like not just running around with a stone ax and fucking singing while people try to shoot arrows
[1803.10s -> 1810.31s]  at me and walking people in little cubes to fight each other. Like it's going to be like stuff to do
[1810.31s -> 1820.86s]  and not 5,000 people connecting at the same time. Look at this dude. I see this image a lot and I
[1820.86s -> 1836.46s]  don't really know what it is. This is, this is a Jojo thing. It has to be because of that, right?
[1836.46s -> 1843.90s]  J omega low J omega low. Uh, I don't know what it's referencing exactly, but people seem to
[1843.90s -> 1856.79s]  really like this exact scene. Uh, I think we've never seen this one before. We've seen stuff from
[1856.79s -> 1861.19s]  science before since, and I'm going to, I say it wrong every time and I will always say it wrong.
[1861.19s -> 1867.51s]  Hard for me to even remember my own friend's names. It's a lie. So like, don't like people like,
[1867.51s -> 1870.63s]  well, that's kind of concerning, dude. Like what are you fucking talking about? That's, I'm kidding.
[1870.63s -> 1880.65s]  It's a joke. Joe the werelord. The werelord has turned into a auto bed. Uh, it's been washed
[1880.65s -> 1887.05s]  and it's now autos like coy auto leg loves this thing. He sleeps on it. He plays with it.
[1887.29s -> 1905.93s]  It's like auto bed now. It's very cute. Tomato flan Leo's. I remember this. This is from the
[1907.62s -> 1921.86s]  last, I think. Yeah. Can we go over this breakfast for a second? Uh, more, this is important. So I
[1921.86s -> 1926.98s]  don't know who the fuck, there's gotta be some insider bullshit with like the breakfast industry
[1926.98s -> 1931.22s]  on how much food and how much shit you're supposed to have out during breakfast time.
[1931.22s -> 1939.90s]  Right. So when I eat breakfast, if I'm have a bowl of cereal, it's just a bowl of cereal.
[1940.14s -> 1946.57s]  Go back, go back. What do you mean go back? What, what, what, what happened? What? Oh, whoa, whoa,
[1946.57s -> 1961.43s]  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What? Oh, please. You've already seen that one. Anyways, anyways,
[1961.43s -> 1968.94s]  when I eat a bowl of cereal, I'm done. In fact, sometimes I pour a little too much cereal than I
[1968.94s -> 1973.90s]  think I can even eat. And you eat half the bowl of cereal and you look at the rest of the soggy mess
[1973.90s -> 1978.47s]  that you've made and you go, Oh, this is fucking, this is gross. I don't even want to eat this.
[1978.47s -> 1982.07s]  So you try to, what I try to do now is do a little bit of cereal, a little bit of milk,
[1982.07s -> 1985.83s]  eat that first, a little bit of cereal, a little bit of milk, eat that until I'm done.
[1985.83s -> 1990.62s]  Right. Instead of just dumping a five cups of cereal in a bowl this high.
[1990.62s -> 1996.60s]  This is what I don't understand. I don't know anyone that's ever done this in their entire life
[1996.60s -> 2002.60s]  is have a bowl of cereal, eggs, breakfast, whatever. And then have like a buffet of scones
[2002.60s -> 2013.05s]  and shit on the table. And sorry to sound strange here, but coffee and orange juice,
[2013.05s -> 2019.27s]  that doesn't mix together very well. What are you taking a sip of orange juice
[2019.27s -> 2024.26s]  and then taking a sip of your coffee? That's like brushing your teeth and then drinking
[2024.26s -> 2028.82s]  orange juice. If you know that combination, it's like a cilantro like instant puke reaction
[2028.82s -> 2035.21s]  for a lot of people. So what do you drink? You got to drink this first. No, you got this,
[2035.21s -> 2040.97s]  you got to drink this one first. It's hot and then drink this later. It's room temperature.
[2040.97s -> 2046.95s]  The whole like complete breakfast is always like three pieces of toast, four scones, three eggs,
[2046.95s -> 2055.67s]  two pieces of bacon, a full bowl of cereal and oatmeal. What the fuck are you talking about?
[2055.67s -> 2059.51s]  I eat one of these in the morning because I don't, in the morning I get like kind of,
[2059.51s -> 2063.27s]  I'm not hungry in the morning. I can only eat something light or small or something a little
[2063.27s -> 2069.29s]  bit. Who eats four danishes for breakfast in the morning and like a full orange juice and a bowl
[2069.29s -> 2078.02s]  of fucking tomatoes? Well, this is not, I mean, that's rude. Just like give me a cup of coffee
[2078.02s -> 2082.18s]  and like maybe some toast with a little bit of fucking jam on it. That's it. Or like a little
[2082.18s -> 2086.74s]  bit of cereal. Maybe even like some, just like a smoothie or something. Like this is ridiculous
[2086.74s -> 2092.73s]  and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of hearing about this. What are you going to do about it?
[2092.73s -> 2096.25s]  Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I'm just going to complain to you about it for like 10 minutes
[2096.25s -> 2100.57s]  and then forget I even was angry about it in the first place. And then a year will go by
[2101.21s -> 2103.69s]  and I'll see it again and it'll irritate me for five minutes again.
[2105.53s -> 2121.53s]  Take that fucking food industry. Moving on. I don't have to say sorry about that.
[2130.81s -> 2139.27s]  Hello, you know, small ass Megalop, tiny fuck. Now this is a good one. Half of you don't leave
[2139.27s -> 2159.67s]  because he's on screen. Literally unintelligible. The down arrows. I can't get over that. It's so
[2159.67s -> 2172.47s]  funny to me. I wake up laughing at this sometimes. I'm in the shower laughing about this. That was
[2172.47s -> 2177.88s]  like a big Halloween stream. It was like almost 10,000 fucking people watching that stream and
[2177.88s -> 2184.60s]  like five, like four fucking thousand people left. I can't even, I have to talk about it every time
[2184.60s -> 2196.58s]  because it's fucking hysterical to me. This is great though. This is fantastic. I even forgot,
[2196.58s -> 2205.22s]  I didn't at one point, wasn't I like eating bugs and stuff? Well, not me, but I saw it on the screen
[2205.22s -> 2213.22s]  over here. I saw it on, I was watching and I was like, what is he doing over there? What is he
[2213.22s -> 2222.17s]  crazy? Wasn't he eating, wasn't he eating bugs in like clay? There was a joke that was supposed to
[2222.17s -> 2229.05s]  be happening and it might have been too dark, but there were spiders. Little spiders. Look, look, I'm
[2230.78s -> 2241.46s]  spoiler alert. There were bugs. We had spiders that were on strings and one of the people that
[2241.46s -> 2246.74s]  were there, one of the crew was, was going to drag them across the table and I was going to
[2246.74s -> 2261.94s]  keep eating them and the strings all broke. So we, so I had to try to find ways to eat the spiders
[2266.73s -> 2276.01s]  and one of them was huge. One of them was this big and before we started, before the stream was live,
[2276.01s -> 2283.29s]  I remember the, the production manager was just like, are you, are you, are you, I don't think we
[2283.29s -> 2291.77s]  can do that. And I'm like, well, yeah, we can. We'll figure it out. We put them on the strings.
[2291.77s -> 2300.04s]  They were supposed to bounce across the table and like, give it out. Oh, and it didn't work at all.
[2300.04s -> 2307.75s]  Wait, that was you? I was in, I was a part of the production. I knew this is a person that I hired.
[2307.75s -> 2314.14s]  This wasn't me. Of course not. It's not fucking me. I will prove it to you guys. I'll prove it to you
[2314.14s -> 2319.67s]  guys. Don't worry. One day I'll prove this to you that we're not the same person. I will be in the
[2319.67s -> 2330.25s]  same room with bugleberry on camera. That's not the same person. Big wow chat is big brain chat.
[2330.25s -> 2344.44s]  Remember rum layout. Can't, oh, can't remember rum layout. Sorry. No scanner, no scanner. Tag me.
[2345.26s -> 2349.26s]  No, I'm shy. Please don't ask for tagging since some tag on purpose. Wait, tag me?
[2351.51s -> 2369.72s]  Is this me saying this? I like the, I like the, is that, that's supposed to be Kim? I wish I had these.
[2369.72s -> 2386.50s]  That'd be great. Leg muscles. Holy shit. Whoa. That's, that's some, that's some, that's some
[2386.50s -> 2400.18s]  turkey leg right there. That is like a full like Disney turkey leg. Jesus. All right. Nice.
[2400.18s -> 2415.13s]  Tricked you. Uh, what'd you trick us for? It's Egypt and we're both blog pyros. What is this done
[2415.13s -> 2428.23s]  with? It's very neat. It's like, it's almost like a crayon. It looks like crayon. Very well done
[2428.23s -> 2436.01s]  crayon. Crayon brush. That's cool. Don't you want to see this as a, hold on. I have to apply lip balm
[2436.01s -> 2445.66s]  before I turn into fucking dust. Don't you want to see like a cartoon like this? They already did.
[2445.66s -> 2452.94s]  What was it? What was it called? Um, uh, what the fuck was it? God. It was like, was it, you know,
[2452.94s -> 2458.06s]  a kid that could draw stuff. The Chalk Zone. Yeah, that's what it was. Good thing I wasn't on camera
[2458.06s -> 2471.67s]  for that embarrassing impression. Yeah, it was, it was Chalk Zone. They still making episodes of that
[2471.67s -> 2483.62s]  TV show or is it gone forever? What do they still make episodes of? What the fuck is on TV right
[2483.62s -> 2495.56s]  now? Teen Titans. Well, I could have told you that it was Teen Titans. Teen Titans has turned into
[2495.56s -> 2506.70s]  the infomercial of Cartoon Network. And what I mean by that is it's on like six straight hours.
[2506.70s -> 2509.90s]  You know, like when you, when you turn on TV at like one o'clock in the morning, it's infomercials
[2509.90s -> 2517.48s]  for like seven hours straight. Teen Titans is now the like, we don't know what to put on this block.
[2517.48s -> 2524.44s]  It's going to be four or five straight hours of Teen Titans. It's such, it's such a great thing
[2524.44s -> 2537.21s]  just to have there. It's got the music on here. I don't, that's not, I don't have anything bad to
[2537.21s -> 2543.85s]  say about Teen Titans. I don't even watch it. I'm just saying, I just, I'll have the TV on. This
[2543.85s -> 2549.37s]  actually happened very recently. It was like, I thought I was stuck in a fucking time warp
[2549.37s -> 2554.65s]  because I was drifting off and it was very, very late. I fell asleep and I, well, I put the TV on.
[2554.65s -> 2559.37s]  So the TV's turned on. It's on Cartoon Network. I was watching like Adult Swim before I fell
[2559.37s -> 2565.99s]  asleep or something like that. This is in a hotel room. And I remember hearing, okay, and coming up
[2565.99s -> 2572.79s]  next, we've got Teen Titans Go. Let's get it. Let's go, whatever they do, right? And it was like,
[2574.63s -> 2580.95s]  Nickelodeon splashes and stuff. And then, okay, I woke me up and I then went back to bed. And then
[2580.95s -> 2588.58s]  I woke it up by again. All right, Titans, it's time for Teen Titans Go. And I'm like, Teen Titans Go
[2588.58s -> 2597.61s]  happened again. And I fell back asleep. And this happened like three more times before it was like,
[2597.61s -> 2603.77s]  okay, Titan Goers, Teen Titans Go coming up next, only on Cartoon Network. And I like grabbed the
[2603.77s -> 2614.06s]  fucking remote and I was like, shut the fuck up. Turn it off. I thought I could just sleep with
[2614.06s -> 2638.41s]  this, but no, turn this shit off. What is this? What is it? What are you doing? Okay. So, um,
[2645.11s -> 2670.33s]  this is a schedule for Cartoon Network. Gumball, Teen Titans Go. This is, it doesn't, yeah, this
[2670.33s -> 2679.56s]  is real. There are three television shows. Okay, I love Gumball. If there's anything that I think
[2680.36s -> 2688.07s]  Gumball should have, Gumball should have a block here. Okay. But I mean, when your schedule
[2688.07s -> 2693.03s]  on your television network looks like somebody that needs a disc defragmentation,
[2693.75s -> 2705.35s]  nothing's probably wrong. I'm just saying. Look at the Christmas one. Hold on, there's a Christmas
[2705.35s -> 2719.70s]  one. What? Is this a joke? Or is this like somebody fucked this up and made this the way
[2720.82s -> 2749.13s]  Teen Titans? Oh, Steven Universe! Steven Universe! What time? Friday at 7 30. Whoa. Teen Titans Go
[2749.13s -> 2759.30s]  Island Adventure. Is that a movie? Cause this is, this is, no, this is, what is this? A movie?
[2759.30s -> 2777.54s]  It's a 30 minute episode. They made a movie too. Well, um, all right. That was the Cartoon Network
[2777.54s -> 2790.63s]  schedule. Let's get back to where we were, which I believe wasn't right here. Hey, was it this one?
[2790.63s -> 2810.04s]  Were we on this one last? Moving on. Jerma and his gamer son. This is from rewatching the Mario RPG
[2810.04s -> 2814.92s]  Vaude and thought something like this would make 12 year old Jerma pog his ass off.
[2820.52s -> 2835.72s]  Season 2. Fighter Pass 2. Fighter 1. Travis Touchdown. Fighter 2. Geno. Fighter 3. Beautiful
[2835.72s -> 2859.08s]  Joe. Fighter 4. Mew 2. Fighter 5. Fire Emblem Carrot. And I don't know which one,
[2859.90s -> 2892.74s]  cuz they're all the same. Get a load of this guy. That's not even a hot take. That's not even a
[2892.74s -> 2898.74s]  hot take. That's not even a hot take anymore. That was a hot take like five months ago,
[2898.74s -> 2903.72s]  or like a year ago. That's me just being like, hey, like, I'm gonna jump on that thing that
[2903.72s -> 2907.32s]  people say. Hey, you know that thing about like too many Fire Emblem characters and that they're
[2907.32s -> 2913.53s]  all like sword users? Hey, I'm gonna say that now. Aren't I like controversial? And it's like, dude,
[2913.53s -> 2919.75s]  come on. Somebody made that joke like fucking two years ago. But really though, I hope we don't,
[2919.75s -> 2922.95s]  I hope we don't see any more Fire Emblem characters. I hope we don't. I mean, that's
[2922.95s -> 2929.40s]  Siri. What a cool Siri. Just Super Mario. They don't need more people in it than Super Mario
[2929.40s -> 2935.46s]  Brothers. Super Mario Brothers character here, by the way. Super, I haven't seen a new
[2936.02s -> 2943.82s]  representer for the Mario series in, it's never, it's just Wario. Like Smash Brothers Brawl.
[2943.82s -> 2974.73s]  Piranha Plant. Fuck! Fuck! Here's Waterman. Delete your stream. Apology. This is cute. This is
[2974.73s -> 2981.64s]  kind of scary, but it's cute. At the same time, I mean, the rat is cute. Wait, why is it, wait,
[2981.64s -> 2991.96s]  no, is the rat like sad? What's, wait, what's going on here? What's wrong with me? Let him go,
[2991.96s -> 3000.47s]  let him go, let him go. Why, why do I have this impression on people? I do not like this painting,
[3000.47s -> 3022.76s]  chat. It's smug or mocks me. World War II. World War III. Wait, is that supposed to be just me?
[3023.32s -> 3049.10s]  I don't understand. I don't understand. Nice baseball. Yeah, unsettling. It's like that,
[3049.10s -> 3064.04s]  this, this is like my, I have such an evil presence. Why do I have such an evil fucking
[3064.04s -> 3081.50s]  presence in every picture? Every time, that Joel Vinesauce, he didn't, he didn't make this.
[3085.19s -> 3094.78s]  Why would he make this? Why would Joel draw a picture of me, like, very detailed picture of me
[3094.78s -> 3102.18s]  in a fucking baseball uniform? This is, there's no way this is Joel. He did not make this.
[3102.82s -> 3121.51s]  That's so odd. Like, that's so odd. Why would you put this here? This is like a really, like,
[3121.51s -> 3127.35s]  detailed picture. Joel didn't do this. No, I'm not saying that Joel, like, can't make detailed photos.
[3127.35s -> 3133.21s]  I'm saying, like, why would he do this? He, like, he doesn't have time for this. He's busy.
[3135.75s -> 3151.85s]  Call Joel. He's crying. Why not? He didn't draw this. He did not. I've seen Joel's drawings.
[3151.85s -> 3156.55s]  And by the way, one of them's on here. One of Joel's drawings is actually on here.
[3157.64s -> 3164.52s]  And it wasn't like me batting detailed. No, it's, it's like, he drew me with these big
[3164.60s -> 3169.32s]  stacked shoulders and these tiny legs. This is not a Joel photo. This is a fake photo.
[3170.04s -> 3181.16s]  He made two. I don't, I don't think he drew this. What if he did? I, that's, I know. What,
[3181.16s -> 3186.20s]  what if he really did? Somebody find out for me. Like, and I'll hear back. What a fake friend.
[3186.20s -> 3211.48s]  What? Oh, I love this. He said he did. Did he? Did he actually? Uh, is that true? Yes.
[3213.91s -> 3226.44s]  Whoa. You go, big guy. Uh, this is the rats. He'd be a rat and fireman. Everybody's lost.
[3226.44s -> 3233.38s]  Is that guy a triplet of a theme park? Think of how many great theme park characters exist
[3233.38s -> 3241.67s]  in this community. Can you imagine the rides that could be made over like the rats and fireman and
[3242.90s -> 3249.35s]  me? Did you like that little? I just did like a smug neck head.
[3251.70s -> 3262.65s]  I didn't do that on purpose. This is cute though. Uh, this is, you seem to be a short streamer. Do
[3262.65s -> 3271.26s]  you need help with that? Yes. Help me or no. This is, uh, from hypnospace, hypnospace outlaw.
[3271.98s -> 3282.79s]  I look to be in some, in some distraught BWL, right? Uh, get well soon. German from Jude
[3282.79s -> 3291.77s]  Minecraft. Has to be, gotta put a Garfield in there somewhere. It's cool. Cute. Of course,
[3291.77s -> 3300.92s]  there's a rat. Always a rat. Garfield. What was the last Garfield reference? Anybody know?
[3300.92s -> 3307.53s]  What was the actual last Garfield reference? Okay. I'm so sorry. Not right. No, no, no. I mean,
[3307.53s -> 3315.62s]  like a true Garfield is, has a significant time on stream. Um, I was rubbing my face and had an
[3315.62s -> 3330.58s]  itchy eye. But in like 2018, yeah. Uh, fireman, waterman, earthman, windman. Pretty cute. This
[3330.58s -> 3337.08s]  is element man. What element am I? Didn't I already do that? This is me eating my own arm.
[3337.80s -> 3345.32s]  But what was, what element was I? Wasn't I fire or air or something? I was air because I could,
[3345.32s -> 3348.76s]  I just like fucking fly around and like float around and I'm like, I'm like this way, that way,
[3348.76s -> 3358.28s]  this way, that way. Right. And I got like, I'm air, right? Yeah. I'm definitely an air spirit.
[3361.48s -> 3367.02s]  Yeah. That's my, my element for sauna is air for sure. Oh, by the way, I'm not even reacting
[3367.02s -> 3371.66s]  to this on stream. Yes. This is me eating my own arm. But I did this, I was angry at a game
[3372.38s -> 3388.82s]  and I bit my arm very, very gently. Is that from Mr. Mosquito? Toad lipstick. Somebody will, if you
[3388.82s -> 3396.30s]  don't, if you just link it, link the clip. We have little, uh, collectible icons. This grandpa.
[3396.94s -> 3407.56s]  That one just stuck out so much for me. Little like figurines. All right. Let me see if I get,
[3407.56s -> 3422.09s]  this is checks. Uh, egg with a bird and eye, sun, moon, chair. Everything is mining of Isaac,
[3422.09s -> 3425.77s]  by the way. Like these, I could, I could see me running into a room and picking all these up and
[3425.77s -> 3434.71s]  then giving like plus like two speed or like plus one damage or something. Oh, that's been on the
[3434.71s -> 3441.88s]  mind lately. Finding the Isaac's been on my brain every day now. You know what that means?
[3441.88s -> 3447.90s]  That means it's time to sit up to play it. I've made, when I start making references to shit,
[3447.90s -> 3452.70s]  that's how you know it's time. Although not World of Warcraft because I'm not going to play that
[3452.70s -> 3459.54s]  again. I don't see something gross. So this is, uh, this is what happens if you let a coffee sip.
[3459.54s -> 3465.06s]  There's a little bit of almond milk in here and it's turned into that where the coffee is on top
[3465.06s -> 3478.38s]  and the almond milk is now on the bottom, which now this is a gross drink and the ice has watered
[3478.38s -> 3503.66s]  it down. Just mix it with my finger. Ballast. Oh, Jeremy, you're not fucking good at anything.
[3503.66s -> 3508.38s]  Jeremy, you can't do anything. What do you have like two IQ? I almost just spilled it on myself
[3508.38s -> 3515.86s]  right there. Uh, this is great though. This is awesome. This is a, uh, re-imagining. I think
[3515.86s -> 3532.38s]  we've seen this before. This is the most interesting man in the world face. I don't even know why this
[3532.46s -> 3537.98s]  is here. It's, uh, it's me. I don't even know. I don't know. I guess. Look at that hair though.
[3537.98s -> 3549.40s]  That's long. It's long now, but that was very long. I look like Wes Anderson. Does he still look like
[3549.40s -> 3561.38s]  this? Fishy mint. This is a little fireman icons and, uh, chat. This is really cute. I love it.
[3561.38s -> 3576.76s]  Let's zoom in a little. It's great. Good shit. Here we go from that to this. Okay, if this is
[3576.76s -> 3593.02s]  like fireman, this is fireman's like evil grandma. Holy shit. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh those fucking toes.
[3594.65s -> 3605.24s]  Oh my God. That's fucking heinous. That is heinous. Oh, this is good though. This is very,
[3605.24s -> 3616.89s]  very, very good. Whoa. I know what it sounds like too. It's got like what it is like.
[3620.01s -> 3629.00s]  You think you can stop me? I don't think so. He's got like a, well, I like an Ursula voice. Just,
[3629.00s -> 3647.46s]  okay, make that talk with a line from Ursula. What do you think this sounds like? Have this lip sync
[3647.46s -> 3663.38s]  poor unfortunate souls while walking around and like going like this and like this. That's grandpa.
[3663.38s -> 3679.10s]  I can't do Ursula. Try. I just did. And apparently everybody fucking hated it. This is Zapman.
[3679.82s -> 3692.65s]  This is not a fireman, but like with a person's face. Oh, Murius. Always, always up vote Murius
[3692.65s -> 3703.53s]  under every circumstance. Very cute. Here's the poses that I did that I can never delete.
[3706.42s -> 3713.46s]  Little did I know. And I remember this stream of picking up a YouTube video
[3714.18s -> 3717.94s]  and like desperately trying to do these as accurate as possible and not even knowing
[3717.94s -> 3725.67s]  what I was doing when it's green screen stream too. I don't know. I don't know. I can't.
[3726.94s -> 3732.62s]  I don't know. I don't know. Once like I feel, I wish I could fucking tell you.
[3733.66s -> 3737.54s]  We'll talk about it in a second, but this is pixel art of bugleberry,
[3738.26s -> 3748.55s]  which is actually pretty good. I like it a lot. Actually it's an emo. It's a little too big for
[3748.55s -> 3753.03s]  an emo, but I think it specifically said it wasn't supposed to be an emo. They just like doing pixel
[3753.03s -> 3771.70s]  art. Let's see. I'd be a little too dark. No, maybe not. Like up here and like down here.
[3775.03s -> 3783.00s]  I can, I guess, you know, you can see it. It works. Put the candle. It's a discord emo. Oh,
[3783.00s -> 3792.65s]  okay. Well, that makes sense. You will be flashed. You know, I've thought about what I want to go
[3792.65s -> 3802.18s]  back to. I really want to go back to light gun stuff. I do, but just so hard to actually capture
[3802.18s -> 3808.18s]  that and get it right. If you, if you actually, I don't think it's possible without a CRT TV,
[3808.18s -> 3813.99s]  CRT TV. And that thing was such a pain in the ass. If that thing's gone forever. No, that,
[3813.99s -> 3823.78s]  I do not have that TV. That TV, that TV was such a pain in the ass. Seriously. You know how hard
[3823.78s -> 3828.36s]  that was to get that out of that fucking room? You know how hard it was to get it into the room?
[3829.08s -> 3843.99s]  Thing was 400 pounds. What song? This is the Celeste OST. No, it's just, I don't know exactly
[3843.99s -> 3851.26s]  what song it is. It's just on the OST. Very, very good OST. Very good music in this fucking game.
[3851.26s -> 3859.21s]  The game's really good too. I think it was fun. It's a fun game. Oh, here are the three,
[3861.13s -> 3868.70s]  Dick Dastley Richard and the other two that don't have names. This is the only one that had a name.
[3869.26s -> 3878.14s]  This is cool. I like the coin. Oh, is it? It's a bald coin. It's a bald coin. It's the gang. It's
[3878.14s -> 3900.87s]  the gang. The gang's here. Give them names now. I don't know. Fucking Button Up Barry and Dr.
[3900.87s -> 3914.01s]  Digestion. No, don't leave that. There's more of these. I think this is the, the same group.
[3914.01s -> 3919.48s]  Put these together. Too late. Too late. Already on the wiki. Too late. Too late. Too late.
[3920.28s -> 3933.21s]  You know, like the original shitty drawing that I did, that was the thumbnail for all the grandpa
[3933.21s -> 3941.03s]  videos in like 2011, 2012. That's the original. You drew a face in less than five seconds.
[3945.06s -> 3951.18s]  Making an emote. Why would I make this? It's not even relevant anymore. Grandpa is like not a
[3951.18s -> 3957.38s]  relevant character. He's been replaced by Bugle. And he's gone. Didn't you see the German Rumble
[3957.46s -> 3973.19s]  live? He's gone. He's, he's gone. No longer relevant. Snort. He's a demon. Hey, he's back in hell.
[3975.22s -> 3986.17s]  He got one opportunity to come through the portal and he fucked it up. He ain't dead. Well, I mean,
[3986.17s -> 3996.15s]  he's, he's where he is. He had a heart attack. How do you fuck that up? I don't know. He should
[3996.15s -> 4001.03s]  have been like, he should have been taking like an omega-3 supplement in hell. What am I supposed to
[4001.03s -> 4021.98s]  do? What is this? What character is this? Slime man? I love Pac-Man. Pac-Man, I'm starting to
[4021.98s -> 4031.80s]  realize something. Cheeto is kind of just a zoomer Pac-Man. I'm kind of realizing this.
[4032.44s -> 4048.84s]  They're both wicked cool. But yeah, wicked cool. What? I'm from fucking Boston, dude. Is that
[4048.84s -> 4062.06s]  how we fucking talk, dude? This is great though. A little sketch we have. Oh, if you give me that
[4062.06s -> 4067.50s]  pillow, I'll give you this toothbrush. Okay, just don't tell my dad. See, look, I told you,
[4067.50s -> 4075.27s]  this is now actually, this is now locked into canon. See, it's a werelord. That's a good trade.
[4075.27s -> 4085.48s]  That's not a bad trade. We have Cheeto on the playground with other, that's a J and then
[4085.48s -> 4096.81s]  a little slug. Oh, is that the snake? This is farmer man, I think is what it was. What the fuck
[4096.81s -> 4102.76s]  is going on? Hey, hey, how do I get rid of, how do I get rid of the magnifying glass?
[4104.07s -> 4107.19s]  I have the magnifying glass open right now. You can't see it on your screen. How do I get
[4107.19s -> 4141.29s]  rid of the escape? I pressed alt. Hold on, there it is. Okay, that was weird. This works so well.
[4141.29s -> 4158.52s]  It like, it's perfect. It's like, that's, it's just, it's perfect. What do I, what do you want
[4158.52s -> 4174.92s]  me to tell you? Here, hey, hey, cheers to that one. Oh sure, okay. A coffee from earlier this
[4174.92s -> 4178.60s]  morning and you got another cup because you're a fucking weirdo and didn't put ice and new
[4178.60s -> 4193.35s]  coffee in this cup. Sure. Cheers to that one. Of course we will. Joel and Jerma, Joel versus
[4193.35s -> 4205.06s]  Jerma from the Vine Wrestle. The coffee is fucking vile, dude. No, it's not. That's just coffee.
[4205.06s -> 4210.20s]  Fucking looks like a little bit of almond milk in it. That's just, that's just coffee. That's just,
[4210.20s -> 4217.00s]  that's black coffee with like almond milk and then no sugar, no bullshit, no sweetener, no sweetness.
[4217.96s -> 4238.44s]  Sure, vanilla? I'm gonna add. Although that would be a 10. Uh, here we go. Almond milk is disgusting.
[4238.44s -> 4253.72s]  Okay, what would I say? Hey, you wouldn't dumb. Don't, hey. That's like, okay, that's like saying
[4253.72s -> 4261.00s]  I don't like the color green. All right. Why do you have a green car? I don't like the color green.
[4262.34s -> 4279.98s]  Uh, is that your car? No. Whose car is it? It's your car. Right, right. Fuck yeah, I don't like
[4279.98s -> 4294.95s]  that color. That color sucks. Destroyed with facts. That was a bad analogy. No, it's not. It's if you
[4294.95s -> 4300.49s]  don't like the color green, I don't give a shit. I like the color green. It's not your car, motherfucker.
[4301.05s -> 4330.38s]  Stretch is squish. I love the stretch. It's just like happy rat lunar year. Oh my goodness. This is,
[4330.38s -> 4336.73s]  this is cool. This is cool. Right? You know what I'm saying? You know what I mean? You know what I'm
[4336.81s -> 4343.96s]  saying? Right? You know what I mean? Should learn words at the end of sentences. Oh, this is cool.
[4343.96s -> 4353.78s]  I like it. Uh, this is, this is the chat fursona apparently. Um, why, why do I, this is like,
[4355.86s -> 4363.45s]  this right here and this. Wouldn't it somewhere else? Chat rat. Chat's official fursona is here
[4363.45s -> 4370.25s]  at long last. Evil. Greasy. Something. All right. Where's bag to honor dick dastardly? And it's,
[4371.13s -> 4378.73s]  I don't, I hate this word. I hate that word. You know, there's some, like we, there's some words
[4378.73s -> 4382.97s]  that, that, that you, that you just hate the way they sound. You don't like even saying them or
[4382.97s -> 4390.84s]  hearing them. Like I can't even say it. I hate it. I hate the way it sounds. It's like, it's like,
[4390.84s -> 4399.16s]  I hate it. I can't say it. I can't say it. Stinky. Oh, I fucking hate that word. I hate that word.
[4399.88s -> 4411.18s]  Smelly is a little better, but, oh, that's the most unpleasant sounding word in the English
[4411.18s -> 4423.83s]  language. Stinky. Stinky. I'm done. This is a lot of stuff going on in here. There's the FTK stream.
[4424.39s -> 4433.29s]  It's moist. No, it's not moist. It's fine. Moist. You know why moist is perfectly fine? Because when
[4433.29s -> 4442.02s]  I think of the word moist, I think of, I think of a cake and I think of fork. I think, I see a
[4442.02s -> 4449.62s]  fork pressing down on a cake and the cake like smushing and getting coagulated into the fork
[4450.50s -> 4455.46s]  and then suddenly the fork going in and picking up the piece of cake. That's, that's what I see
[4455.46s -> 4460.10s]  when I hear the word moist. I think of a pound cake that you put in your mouth and it just like
[4460.74s -> 4468.44s]  smushes down in your gums and teeth and shit. When I think of the word stinky, I think of
[4472.22s -> 4487.75s]  like dirty laundry. Like, oh, like a diaper. Like, oh, stinky. Oh, no, like a diaper.
[4487.75s -> 4495.99s]  Go like cat litter. Yeah. Like, oh, let's stinky cat litter. Oh, fuck that word. That word sucks.
[4496.63s -> 4499.67s]  All right. Let's go. This is great though. Oh, wait, wait. I want to see what a
[4500.63s -> 4512.58s]  $75,000 for this. It's pretty cheap though, don't you think? Look, more, more evidence.
[4513.46s -> 4518.82s]  Look, I told you guys. I think that this, this probably, this probably a picture of this somewhere.
[4519.46s -> 4526.82s]  You're the rat. This is really, really good. This is like really, really detailed.
[4527.62s -> 4534.12s]  Really nice work. Show the picture. I don't have the picture available to me.
[4535.16s -> 4551.32s]  This is manga, anime, and then the Netflix adaptation. It's pretty good. Pretty good.
[4552.87s -> 4561.64s]  There it is. See, this is Joel. Joel Vinesauce drew this one. Not like the guy with the,
[4561.64s -> 4570.79s]  not the bat one. That's a different style. Is this supposed to be me or Joel? That's me, right? Of
[4570.79s -> 4581.69s]  course it is. I, that's my fucking body type. Here is a, just a rat. Or you're the rat. I like
[4581.69s -> 4592.63s]  this. You know, this is like my, one of my favorite colors. Of course it is. Of course it is.
[4596.33s -> 4606.76s]  I am exhibit A. I love this light sort of teal aqua green experiment kind of green,
[4606.76s -> 4614.12s]  like teal into spearmint. I could look at this all day. I know what this smells like. You know
[4614.20s -> 4621.32s]  what I mean? This has a smell. It's like a clean, fresh laundry smell. It's like a minty laundry
[4622.12s -> 4626.52s]  air, like opening up your window on a fucking cool afternoon in the fall.
[4627.88s -> 4636.07s]  No, not, not that word. I know this color has a smell and this color has a taste.
[4638.39s -> 4641.51s]  Look at this. Look at my, look at my shirt and imagine what it tastes like.
[4644.34s -> 4655.11s]  See? It's not mint. It's like a freshness. Like a pistachio ice cream kind of freshness.
[4668.17s -> 4677.86s]  So this is the, it's mint. It's not mint. There are other things that are light green that aren't
[4677.86s -> 4717.43s]  bubble gum. Like, like the green milkshake from Sonic. It's like the St. Patrick's Day milkshake
[4717.43s -> 4740.46s]  from Sonic. Eat that, food industry. It's mint. It's literally mint. No, it's, it's whatever.
[4740.46s -> 4745.66s]  Toothpaste, toothpaste, toothpaste. No, toothpaste is like toothpaste. It's like frozen. It's like
[4745.66s -> 4751.78s]  blue and no, no, and tooth, most toothpaste is just white. All right. I, I gotta talk about some
[4751.78s -> 4759.06s]  stuff. Moving on. This is the bet that we had between me and Joel when we did keep talking
[4759.06s -> 4767.14s]  and nobody explodes, which was, I had to eat like a quadruple bypass burger. I haven't, I haven't
[4767.14s -> 4772.12s]  done that yet. Oh no, I had to put it in my underwear. I didn't have to put one of these in
[4772.12s -> 4786.65s]  my underwear. I'm not going to do that. So like, that was like a joke that we did. Wait, didn't,
[4786.65s -> 4796.12s]  didn't he, did he eat like a bunch of raw eggs? Wait, it's not a scam unless, unless he did his
[4796.12s -> 4807.56s]  part. He actually ate a bunch of raw eggs. He did. That's not good. That's not okay. Don't do that.
[4808.52s -> 4817.45s]  You need to steam them first so you can get rid of the bacteria. Uh, I'll put a fucking hamburger
[4817.45s -> 4824.12s]  down my underwear in like, I don't know, like a couple years or something. Here's a rat. That's
[4824.12s -> 4838.34s]  me on the rat's nose because you know, this one's clever. This is the LGBT pose. I thought it was
[4838.34s -> 4853.96s]  clever. It's very clever. I get it. I get it. Yeah, it's like, it's clever. This shit's clever.
[4856.23s -> 4869.32s]  This is Batman. What is this? Is this, no, this is Joel. Oh, that's Joel. That's me and Joel. I
[4869.32s -> 4879.88s]  thought I was holding a, I thought, I didn't know what this was. All right. I, I was just sweating.
[4885.85s -> 4905.22s]  Clock. The omega symbol. Right, right, right. Hey, this is really good though. Thank you.
[4906.30s -> 4922.94s]  This one's fucked. Look at how fucked up this is. This is the janitor smashing your fucking head
[4923.58s -> 4952.97s]  with the, this is, this is insane. What? That's, that was really good. It's cute. Come on.
[4972.17s -> 4982.66s]  New emote. A new walking emote? Will it be Fireman walk? I feel like, I think we've seen this image
[4982.66s -> 4989.94s]  before, but it's still, this is, this is the like, you're the baby, right? This is like the,
[4989.94s -> 4994.74s]  you opened your eyes for the first time and like, like dads, you're the baby in my arms, right?
[4994.74s -> 4999.69s]  Did we do something weird? I don't remember any. I don't remember what we did two days ago.
[5000.25s -> 5012.02s]  Nice fucking neck. What you meant to say was, why does it look like my nose and right eye have been
[5012.66s -> 5030.73s]  photoshopped into this photo? Here is, uh, German Wars, The Rat Awakens. Which is pretty good.
[5034.62s -> 5039.34s]  I love lightsabers. Remind me, please, when I eventually do get in front of the green screen
[5039.34s -> 5044.86s]  again, I know I've been putting off for a long fucking time, but I, I know there's a whole thing
[5044.86s -> 5051.02s]  that's a suggestion, but please remind me that when we do it again, I want to get a fake lightsaber
[5051.02s -> 5057.74s]  thing and I want to do a full on like lightsaber actual like, and I want, I need it. I need it just
[5057.74s -> 5064.70s]  for me. I want a full lightsaber event that I'm going to do with like 20 lightsaber different
[5064.70s -> 5072.20s]  things. I want all lightsabers. Make sure the lights, the lightsabers green. Yeah. I want a
[5072.20s -> 5079.06s]  full on green lightsaber. Roll eats an egg. Hold on. I'll look at it in a second, but this is,
[5079.06s -> 5089.56s]  this is pretty cool. All the Jojo poses. Hey, look, it's a little rat. Not green at a blend in.
[5090.98s -> 5107.14s]  Have Bugleberry be on it and give him a Darth Maul lightsaber. Maybe.
[5109.08s -> 5117.83s]  Rep in the fireman shirt. This is good shit. Animal crossing. Oh yeah, that is cool. That's
[5117.83s -> 5127.19s]  like an animal crossing. This is cool. I didn't even realize that. Here is, I don't know,
[5128.07s -> 5134.63s]  but looks good. Am I going to play, I'll play the one on Switch when it comes out.
[5139.90s -> 5149.13s]  I love the hat. You got the carnival hat in here. Why is there a reason? Oh, because I said I was
[5149.13s -> 5158.86s]  going to play Odd Michael. Hey. Oh, not quite. A little too green. Good shit. Can't wait for you
[5158.86s -> 5163.82s]  to play it. This is, I zoomed in a little too much, but this is some pixel art of the J.
[5165.30s -> 5170.15s]  Yeah, I'll play the Switch one. When does it come out? I don't want to play the old ones,
[5170.15s -> 5177.62s]  but I want to play the new one. Comes out in 12 days. What? Holy shit. Yeah, let's go.
[5179.08s -> 5184.46s]  Look, I'll play the fuck out of that game. Comes out the same day as Doom Eternal.
[5185.10s -> 5211.70s]  Oh. Now I'll play an animal crossing first. We'll do Doom Eternal afterwards. I look like the villain
[5212.87s -> 5222.74s]  in two or three specific Goosebumps books. This is like what, this is what the bad kid turns into,
[5222.74s -> 5249.11s]  right? At what point did everyone agree in media that this was how a vampire was, you know what
[5249.11s -> 5260.33s]  I mean? Why are their hands curled like this? These long fingernails, they curve their arms.
[5261.70s -> 5272.62s]  It's just odd. A bat. Oh, right, because bats. Shit, that's right. How come in Twilight they
[5272.62s -> 5278.44s]  weren't walking around like, but I don't get, there's vampires. Why did we get rid of it?
[5282.30s -> 5289.02s]  Why didn't Robert Pattinson not have a big long mouth and shit?
[5291.99s -> 5312.06s]  There's a sex appeal. It's not supposed to be scary. Twilight isn't about vampires. Yes,
[5312.06s -> 5323.24s]  it is. It's about the eternal conflict between vampires and werewolves. No, that's Underworld.
[5326.18s -> 5329.38s]  What the fuck happens in Twilight? I don't know what it is. I've never seen it. I mean,
[5329.38s -> 5339.06s]  I know what it is, but what's the premise of Twilight? Okay, okay, Twilight. Spoiler alert
[5339.06s -> 5343.30s]  for Twilight, but who cares? If you're gonna, if you're not, do I really give a shit about
[5343.30s -> 5355.18s]  spoiling Twilight? All right, Twilight is, Robert Pattinson is a sparkly vampire and he bites,
[5357.02s -> 5366.90s]  he bites that girl and then she becomes vampire too. And then there's also that other guy who's
[5367.62s -> 5378.36s]  Taylor and he's a vampire. I know he's a werewolf, right? And they kind of like each other,
[5380.84s -> 5392.39s]  kind of, pretending to not know. I actually, I know I saw somebody say this and you're completely
[5392.39s -> 5398.87s]  accurate. I have to give credit to what creditors do. Somebody said this is like 2008, like 2010
[5398.87s -> 5404.39s]  tier, like jokey reference to something. Like dude, this is like something, like this is like a joke
[5404.39s -> 5410.87s]  from 10 fucking years ago. I know, but remember I'm late to everything. I played Super Mario
[5410.87s -> 5419.48s]  Sunshine for the first time ever four days ago. So, I mean, I'm late to literally everything.
[5421.59s -> 5435.24s]  So anyways, yeah, I've never seen it. I don't plan on seeing it. Anyways, vampire, T-O-D-W,
[5435.24s -> 5440.60s]  too long, didn't watch the whole stream. Vampires, they've got to go back to being fucking weird and
[5440.60s -> 5457.53s]  creepy and scary like this. Year of the 2020 rat Reddit streamer. Oh, look at this up in the
[5457.53s -> 5471.35s]  champagne and dancing. That's what they do best. This is so cute. Zoom in on that watermark. Who
[5471.35s -> 5493.59s]  is it? Wait, wait, did the I will never stop it song come up? I think it did. Hey, look at that.
[5494.71s -> 5508.15s]  Who's that? Close. Not quite. Oh, it is that song. It is the song, the best singing of 2019, right?
[5511.16s -> 5522.12s]  What a cute compact streamer. This is my face mixed with Jim Carrey's face.
[5522.92s -> 5528.95s]  The first thing I thought of was I thought it was one of those, this is not a real person,
[5529.75s -> 5545.16s]  AI generated people, but apparently this is me and Jim Carrey put together, which is odd because I
[5549.06s -> 5569.11s]  I'm not sure where I am. Up here and like into here, mouth and eyes. It's been blended together
[5569.11s -> 5580.14s]  and that's definitely forehead, right? Cause up here he is listening to farting and screaming.
[5589.69s -> 5601.96s]  No, no, no, no. This is good shit. Why does he have a cold? That's, that's me crying.
[5609.06s -> 5615.77s]  You got the one earbud accurate and the shirt's pretty accurate too. Oh, what a fucking nightmare
[5615.77s -> 5630.41s]  that was. Hey, fireman, look at this dude. Take a look. I like the hair on this one. This is like,
[5630.41s -> 5644.06s]  this is a fireman with gel. The fireman that styled the fire. He's going out tonight. Very
[5644.06s -> 5659.42s]  cute. There's another one. Gaze upon man. What is the, if not an eternal flame? It's like a
[5659.42s -> 5681.50s]  charcoaly. Uh, charcoal. What? I just said it was like charcoal kind of. Art words. Art words.
[5682.06s -> 5692.22s]  It's very good. Oh, here's an album. It's called E-Clown. Uh, we have a parental advisory on this.
[5692.94s -> 5699.74s]  Side A, we have Michael Berry Bush favorite breakfast material. Bonk, booze, bam.
[5700.62s -> 5708.23s]  Booze, bonk, bam. Acid base. On the other side is pirate spy, rat burger, giant enemy spider,
[5708.23s -> 5716.50s]  MLG grandpa, and free shit. I hope this was not more than $4. Uh, because some of these are just
[5716.50s -> 5722.17s]  like audio files of me saying two words. There were like three songs on this whole album,
[5722.81s -> 5732.54s]  one of which I stole from somebody else. TF2 radio, 2020. All rights of the produced and owner
[5732.54s -> 5737.98s]  of the work reproduced reserve. Unauthorized copying, hiring, lending. Public, I tricked you.
[5737.98s -> 5758.47s]  It's Egypt and we're both vlog pyros. Pretty good. Oh, no wait. He's confirmed. Too bad it's not
[5758.47s -> 5778.20s]  glue, man. This is adorable. I love it. Very, very clean. You know what I mean? The muscle work back
[5778.20s -> 5794.98s]  here. The muscle work here. Another fucking Jerma character shaking my head. That's fat. No, it's
[5794.98s -> 5802.10s]  not. That's back muscle. I have that same thing. It starts like here and goes like hump back and
[5802.10s -> 5814.01s]  there's like another hump. I have the same thing. It's fucking muscle. I don't even know why you
[5814.01s -> 5825.11s]  made this. Like what did all this is, is an embarrassment when somebody comes over that
[5825.11s -> 5833.90s]  doesn't know what this is. This is like a, oh, that's on your desk. And it's funny until somebody
[5833.90s -> 5838.46s]  like you make a new friend or like maybe like a love interest comes over. And it's like,
[5839.74s -> 5846.90s]  what the fuck is this thing? Are we going to rip it up? Like, oh, that's a joke. That's a streamer
[5846.90s -> 5855.37s]  that I, uh, uh. What do you say to this? No, I know, I know this little guy on the internet.
[5861.61s -> 5871.70s]  Love interest, omega low. Love interest, omega low. Love interest. What are you talking about?
[5879.56s -> 5895.98s]  The sun goes down. Actual psycho Disney villain. Yeah, this is the point in the Disney movie when
[5897.10s -> 5904.49s]  the handsome guy that was a villain, kind of in the first hour of the movie,
[5905.53s -> 5912.17s]  you're like, oh, he's kind of a bad guy. And then like the, this is the finale where there's a big
[5912.17s -> 5916.17s]  fight with like a knife or something. There's a weapon involved here and it's like, Holy shit.
[5916.17s -> 5921.77s]  This is, this is like a rotten evil fucking evil person. And they do that evil face and shit.
[5922.41s -> 5928.41s]  A knife. Yeah. Isn't there, Disney wouldn't allow, what are you talking about? There's knives.
[5929.05s -> 5936.86s]  There's a knife in Aladdin. There's a fucking knife. There's a, there's a knife threat in Aladdin.
[5936.86s -> 5943.90s]  So I don't know what you're talking about. Not only is there a knife, there's a, there's a, like,
[5943.90s -> 5950.06s]  I'm going to stab you in the head. It's a threat. Like I'm coming. I'm going to come down and stab
[5950.06s -> 5969.21s]  you in the fucking head. That happens in Aladdin. Your eternal reward. There you go. There you go.
[5970.09s -> 6002.81s]  This is fucking awesome. Real face. Oh, this is you without makeup on.
[6005.13s -> 6010.89s]  No, that's, that's like my skin's been taken off and draped over a mannequin head.
[6013.45s -> 6024.81s]  That's what this looks like. Link the actual, link the face. Somebody link an image of that.
[6024.81s -> 6029.74s]  So for people that don't know what the fuck this is. It's so fucking ridiculous.
[6042.01s -> 6048.49s]  This is 3d fireman mapped on a 3d plane in a 3d program.
[6054.49s -> 6059.77s]  How big is this though? This looks like it could be huge. Is it like a giant statue or is it little?
[6065.29s -> 6081.38s]  Very cool. This is huge. Okay. This is boomer, boomer germa. Fucking mega milk thing, man.
[6081.38s -> 6084.50s]  God, I got to like, I got to like delete, I got to like stop this out.
[6084.50s -> 6097.53s]  I can't have that be like connected to the community. Oh, fireman. The rats. Oh, that like,
[6097.53s -> 6104.17s]  oh, the thing face. Mega milk. Okay. At some point you've got to like, we've got to steer the
[6104.17s -> 6117.72s]  community in a different direction. Like at some point this has to change. Nice baseball.
[6119.06s -> 6132.62s]  Germa versus jump king. Wait, germa minus two, jump king plus two. Why is that, why is this,
[6132.62s -> 6142.15s]  why would it be plus two? Oh no, the base, the baseball has a, the baseball is sentient.
[6142.15s -> 6171.06s]  Is this fireman? Because you are minus two. This is sick though. Oh, sick! The entire fireman
[6171.94s -> 6194.14s]  family. Let's see who made it. The best part is they're all drawn out except this one is just
[6194.14s -> 6201.56s]  that face just pasted on here and smoothed in with bald head. One of these is not like the other.
[6203.59s -> 6220.68s]  No. And hey, there we are at the art segment here. We have about, now we have about 50 or 60 videos
[6220.68s -> 6229.94s]  to look at. Something like that. Perfect music. Well, the music isn't going to turn off. Good
[6229.94s -> 6238.26s]  shit. Thank you everybody for submitting artwork. You guys are fucking awesome. There's still a
[6238.26s -> 6241.94s]  shitload of stuff that's in that channel that we have to get through. So I've got to figure out
[6241.94s -> 6247.58s]  how we can do it smoothly. We are going to go to the video section, but I'm going to pee first,
[6247.58s -> 6252.06s]  so I'm going to take a minute or two break here and we'll come back with the videos.
[6252.87s -> 6501.03s]  I'll be right back. Okay. Let's turn this music off. Oops a daisy. All right. So let us begin
[6502.60s -> 6508.84s]  our, what is this? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
[6508.84s -> 6521.30s]  It's like, this is every single chat message. I'd never say this to his face, but he's a wonderful
[6521.30s -> 6532.50s]  person and a gifted streamer. It says lewd and rude. I would never say this to his face.
[6533.14s -> 6544.23s]  I would never say this to his face. That's so funny. That's fucking funny. I'd never tell him,
[6544.23s -> 6551.27s]  but well, thank you for that. We're going to start now. We're going to start with a video
[6551.99s -> 6558.97s]  that we talked about previously already is called the, the speedy Grinner. Get ready for the,
[6558.97s -> 6564.57s]  this section of the stream. We potentially be VOD watchers. Sorry, but some of these are probably
[6564.57s -> 6577.05s]  like movie clips and YouTube videos. So sorry, VOD watchers. Let's begin. The first video is,
[6577.05s -> 6592.41s]  like I said, the greedy, the speedy Grinner.
[6617.85s -> 6633.77s]  How the fuck is this a trailer for a show?
[6678.47s -> 6694.33s]  Oh, that was so loud. What the fuck was that? Oh, is this video over? Oh, what the fuck?
[6695.13s -> 6717.70s]  What is speedy Grinner 2? Is this even supposed to be me? No, this is spoilers. Spoilers. No,
[6717.70s -> 6729.05s]  this is spoilers. All right. I'm going to put it in a new tab. Hold on. Let me get this in a new tab.
[6729.05s -> 6746.42s]  Okay. Don't spoil the movie. All right. Is this one going to be as loud or we might as well just
[6746.42s -> 6755.08s]  play this one right now. All right. We're playing this one now. It's a speedy Grinner 2. What am I
[6755.08s -> 6760.04s]  going to do? Not play the fucking sequel immediately after the first one. Here we go.
[6778.55s -> 6781.59s]  Spoiler for the flash.
[6818.47s -> 6831.18s]  I'm
[6831.18s -> 6852.14s]  just squeaking.
[6881.45s -> 6907.22s]  This is like how the show ends. What the fuck? Holy shit. Hopefully nobody cares about that show.
[6910.97s -> 6914.41s]  All right. I got to make, I got an actual warning. We have to do this warning
[6914.41s -> 6919.77s]  every single time, every community content fucking night. Like if you ever have any plans
[6919.77s -> 6925.45s]  of watching any television for the next like six months, just, just leave now. Like, I mean,
[6925.45s -> 6935.94s]  like seriously, like this is, we spoil so many TV shows and so many movies. Just give you a

[7130.49s -> 7134.57s]  Are we ready? I don't know what we're ready for, Jeremy. Extreme filler for untrained,
[7134.57s -> 7140.41s]  unprofessional losers. You fucking wanker. Oh yeah, yeah. You're here with like your

[7182.87s -> 7187.51s]  Guys, I can't, I've said some, just, I don't know. How many, do you want me to explain that?
[7188.94s -> 7196.31s]  That was like from like a 2012 Huntsman video. I can't even tell you what that meant. It meant
[7196.31s -> 7200.71s]  like, I'm going to like, you're going to, you're, you're cooked. Like you're done. It's over.
[7200.71s -> 7214.65s]  You know what I mean? I have no idea. Oh, this one's called shoot him jump. The rhythm heaven.

[7324.60s -> 7334.63s]  All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I want to do this one again. How it feels to chew
[7334.63s -> 7362.54s]  five gum. Well, that was fucking awesome. This one's called, uh, Yugi summons Jerma. Remember,
[7362.54s -> 7366.06s]  if you've, if you ever plan on watching television for any series ever made,
[7366.86s -> 7369.34s]  you can't watch these streams. Okay.
[7379.90s -> 7409.22s]  Of course. Of course it was. Why would it be anything else? God, this is called a normal
[7409.22s -> 7429.18s]  windy night. Normal windy night. Oh, it's a scary one. I'm going to be in the woods and I'm going

[7505.91s -> 7513.14s]  Wait, the, the mirror of my arms, not lifting up. It's not even a mirror.
[7528.66s -> 7539.22s]  Oh no, it's raining outside. I hate this. I hate this. This is terrible.
[7562.49s -> 7572.71s]  Dude, people use, you know what I've noticed? Uh, so what, like two years ago, whatever it was,
[7572.71s -> 7578.18s]  like a year and a half ago, almost two years ago, that I went in front of the green screen.
[7579.98s -> 7588.31s]  This, this below your nose one is, it was like six hours of footage. This appears in so many
[7588.31s -> 7595.72s]  places. It was just a one-off, just a little throw away, 10 seconds and so funny. Just people
[7595.72s -> 7605.27s]  use this one thing everywhere. It makes me laugh every fucking time. And the puke one too. Yeah.
[7605.27s -> 7615.72s]  God, it's fucking funny. This next one is, is guaranteed that I'll like it because as you saw
[7615.72s -> 7622.84s]  last community content night, um, I, I mentioned the baseball video was my favorite green screen
[7622.84s -> 7630.22s]  thing. And what do you know? Here we are. Uh, JLB highlights Elbertson blasts a walk-off slam.
[7630.94s -> 7635.02s]  Every 20th for Janssen here in the ninth inning.
[7672.04s -> 7672.90s]  What is this?
[7672.98s -> 7673.54s]  Is this another,
[7694.42s -> 7695.86s]  nobody down there.
[7707.75s -> 7708.15s]  Hold on.
[7708.15s -> 7727.96s]  The 20th, I love the baseball one. There's so much. I love them. I just want to see this part
[7727.96s -> 7746.15s]  right here.
[7751.99s -> 7760.07s]  And imagine like a fucking, imagine we live in like a hundred years ago and like the,
[7760.07s -> 7767.58s]  there was no such thing as like green screen footage. Man, we truly live in the best time.
[7767.66s -> 7793.62s]  You know what I mean? This one's called DJ Jerma. Oh God. Wait, didn't we already see this?
[7797.42s -> 7814.28s]  I think we've already seen this one. Okay. Uh, this is a ha ha Jerma walk funny.
[7814.28s -> 7841.56s]  I got on the top rope. Why am I running a fucking moron? I don't walk like this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[7841.56s -> 7855.99s]  All right. Yeah. Nah, it's all right. This one's called Jerma, but it's half life sound effects.
[7855.99s -> 7874.12s]  Hey, step off buddy. Don't tick me off. Gordon. What? Oh shit. Major fracture detected.
[7878.52s -> 7896.90s]  Let's try this. Ah, Freeman. Who is responsible for this? Theoretically. Yes. As I expected.
[7897.86s -> 7899.78s]  Do you know who ate all the doughnuts?
[7907.16s -> 7910.04s]  Major fracture detected. No.
[7919.06s -> 7919.62s]  That was rude.
[7931.83s -> 7938.63s]  They'll all go and they'll sit down and be like, and then you have your attention. Oh my God.
[7942.15s -> 7948.74s]  That was really, that was very clever. I liked it. That was very good.
[7949.86s -> 7956.94s]  Clever use of sound effects. Here's a link to that. A lot of people looking for it.
[7956.94s -> 7964.71s]  There it is. That was very good. The thing with half life sound effects is probably fucking
[7964.71s -> 7974.79s]  ridiculous. All right. This is a, this is the, called the death of Jerma 985.
[7975.83s -> 7986.95s]  But as of the first frame you can see here, this is a, this is a Mr. Peanut joke. So yeah,
[7989.37s -> 7992.62s]  can't wait for this one. Here we go.
[8002.42s -> 8012.55s]  Oh, you let go. Hey, Mr. Peanut. No, you don't. Don't do it.
[8013.51s -> 8039.16s]  Holy shit, it worked. I feel fine. Maybe you'll be all right. Maybe not.
[8046.01s -> 8055.16s]  This is the next one. What the fuck? What the hell was that? What the fuck?
[8060.78s -> 8073.77s]  Spoilers, maybe. Uh, it's, we're getting political presidential candidates.
[8074.79s -> 8081.43s]  Political spoilers. Uh, this one's called the Jerma ball, the streak. Yes. More baseball. Yes.
[8081.43s -> 8087.35s]  I can't wait. This is, this one's long too. Holy shit. This one's long. This is called the streak.
[8095.19s -> 8098.95s]  We use the sample of your DNA to clone a bunch of players. Hey, where are you going?
[8107.58s -> 8111.02s]  It's off the scoreboard and they can't get it in time.
[8111.34s -> 8118.86s]  Two runs are in. The big rats are back. The rats have flick-shotted their way from last place to
[8118.86s -> 8126.68s]  first in the AL West. That's somebody's asshole. I hope it's not mine. No, that's mine.
[8127.88s -> 8133.24s]  Something strange is now happening in Las Vegas. Well, there ain't nothing in the rule book that
[8133.24s -> 8139.24s]  says you can't have a team full of clowns. They don't, yeah. Making a joke out of the American
[8139.24s -> 8146.84s]  league. When is there even a major league baseball team in Las Vegas anyway? 16 consecutive games,
[8146.84s -> 8156.17s]  fucking streak in baseball folks in 25 years are screaming and farting.
[8161.66s -> 8168.42s]  This team was written off. None of this makes any sense. Can't be how it happens.
[8168.50s -> 8174.90s]  Drew slugging fastballs. This team has cracked the case wide open on baseball.
[8175.86s -> 8183.90s]  Finishing Dark Souls three on stream was all time number 17. The Vegas Rathletics are now
[8183.90s -> 8191.18s]  two wins away from tying the American league record. 20 wins in a row doesn't seem so impossible
[8191.18s -> 8198.41s]  anymore. They're really going up the top rope here and the league can't take it. The age of
[8198.41s -> 8204.01s]  the Boston Float today. They're the biggest deal since Jerma Rumble live action. These guys are
[8204.01s -> 8210.95s]  laughing. Oh yeah, they could have cloned Reggie or Ricky or Giambi, but instead they chose this
[8210.95s -> 8218.97s]  weirdo from Boston. But hey, the results don't lie. This dude's fucked. Some teams are trolling
[8218.97s -> 8225.21s]  millions of dollars at players, but these guys are paying the same in bits. This isn't just some
[8225.21s -> 8231.53s]  kind of currency, you know? Not a big deal. Not a big deal at all. Because what I would say,
[8231.53s -> 8238.89s]  if what was occurring here made any sense at all, but it doesn't. The statistics don't work here.
[8238.89s -> 8250.50s]  This is bigger than us. Up the middle the rats have won 19 in a row. The 1906 White Sox and the 1947
[8250.58s -> 8267.37s]  Yankees have come. They're going to the road. That's making all of the rules. The giant enemy slider.
[8276.10s -> 8288.38s]  Wait, what happened? Why did we lose? What? The giant enemy slider. The giant enemy slider?
[8289.18s -> 8297.46s]  The Pittsburgh pinwheels.
[8300.10s -> 8307.05s]  I gotta say the best 10 seconds of this whole video is the birds and the fucking
[8307.05s -> 8313.85s]  the tomahawk swing not even in the right spot. I gotta see it again. But these guys are paying
[8313.85s -> 8319.54s]  the same in bits. This isn't just some kind of currency thing, you know? Not a big deal.
[8320.10s -> 8325.54s]  Not a big deal at all. Because what I would say, if what was occurring here made any sense...
[8326.74s -> 8330.74s]  This was fucked. I loved it. This is fucking perfect.
[8333.93s -> 8344.76s]  All the like the voice work. That was a fully scripted out voice. That was perfect.
[8344.76s -> 8358.52s]  Oh man. That was hamster pie. Hamster pie. You're here right now. I'm not sure. I mean this video,
[8358.76s -> 8367.66s]  we're about 30 days behind. So it fucking is hilarious. Oh my god. All right. Moving on.
[8367.66s -> 8376.41s]  Let's keep it rolling. We have... Oh yes. Oh man. Are we gonna have back-to-back fucking
[8377.45s -> 8382.17s]  baseball or Star Wars? You've got my attention. I know I should probably... It's just true. It's
[8382.17s -> 8387.53s]  real. Okay. You want me to not... It's real. This is Compact Jedi and Sidekick Ninja Turtle
[8387.53s -> 8400.66s]  take on Sith Lord. Star Wars Episode 3 spoilers. I love this shit, man. I love this shit.
[8450.28s -> 8503.24s]  Oh man. No hesitation. And it was the baseball swing. I can't wait to get back in front of this
[8503.24s -> 8508.12s]  fucking thing, man. I gotta like... This like rib cage problem. Gotta get the fuck out of here.
[8508.12s -> 8512.31s]  I want to do like another eight hours in front of this thing. You know what I mean? Like
[8512.63s -> 8516.95s]  this is so... This is... You guys are so creative and so... Where you use this shit,
[8516.95s -> 8520.15s]  it's fucking hysterical. I gotta get the fuck in front of this thing again.
[8520.79s -> 8529.96s]  It's been like a year and a half. Oh man. Good shit. Keep going. This is uh...
[8531.24s -> 8593.02s]  Jerma and the Wizard of Oz. Jesus Christ. That was all over the place. But it was good. It was
[8593.02s -> 8600.52s]  very, very good. This is Anthony Bantony exposed by hidden camera. And this is shocking.
[8621.99s -> 8638.34s]  What was this? What program was this made in? What was this? It was like... What animation
[8638.34s -> 8652.60s]  was political? That wasn't political. That wasn't political. This is called uh... This is just a D
[8652.60s -> 8661.51s]  face. Oh, you want to fight? You want to fucking fight me? Don't fucking come at me. Don't...
[8670.78s -> 8676.22s]  This next one is called... Streamer becomes psychotic barbarian in virtual reality.
[8677.10s -> 8683.51s]  I've made it to the zone, the play area, and I'm ready to fucking go nuts.
[8686.22s -> 8695.50s]  Excellent. Hello. Jeremy. I'm Genghis Khan. You go where I go. Defile what I defile. Eat who I eat.
[8695.50s -> 8716.50s]  I'm wild. I'm like a cave fucking beast. Eat this you fucking celery bitch.
[8736.31s -> 8758.57s]  This is what everybody does when they play. Let kids do this. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.
[8760.95s -> 8777.85s]  Oh, get it. Come here you son of a bitch. I'm not a psycho. This is a video. This is...
[8803.82s -> 8826.52s]  What's wrong? What? What? What? What? What's wrong with that? What the hell is going on?
[8831.58s -> 8863.27s]  This guy has love. Everybody, everybody that plays Blade and Sorcery, every single person,
[8864.39s -> 8869.91s]  you try to like cut people's fucking heads off and like stab them in the eye and shit,
[8869.91s -> 8876.23s]  and like throw them off cliffs, as everybody does. You tell me you didn't do that? You didn't like
[8876.23s -> 8880.63s]  throw a person into another person and then like stab them both through the chest with a
[8880.87s -> 8889.82s]  spear and then throw the skewered people off a cliff. But you're lying if you say no.
[8889.82s -> 8902.14s]  Oh, that was fucking crazy. This one's called... I feel like we have we seen this one? It's called
[8902.14s -> 8932.62s]  Jerma Maze. Have we seen this? Good thing I had it turned down. That's it. All right, that's
[8933.18s -> 8939.85s]  scary. I wouldn't want to play this game. This is Jerma Makes a TikTok.
[8940.81s -> 8947.58s]  God damn, man. Freddie, Freddie Dredd. Freddie just gave $400 of bits.
[8959.77s -> 8965.62s]  I don't, I don't, I don't know what that is. It's TikTok. I don't even know what TikTok is.
[8966.74s -> 8990.20s]  I mean, I'm lying, but it's, it's a, it's a clock app. No, I know, I know. I've done it before.
[8990.20s -> 8996.62s]  I don't even, did I even do it again? This, this thing, this thing. Should I do that again?
[8996.78s -> 9004.63s]  No, it's been recorded more than once. So like head move. Animated movement thing. Yeah. I,
[9004.63s -> 9016.38s]  it's, it's recorded somewhere. I won't do it again. This next one is called, uh, Jerma is Speed.
[9017.18s -> 9036.68s]  Jerma is Speed. Speed. Speed. You see, on this channel, I like to call myself Dr. Jekyll
[9036.68s -> 9042.12s]  and Mr. Jerma because I have two different sides. No, no, no. I have a very professional side where
[9042.12s -> 9051.56s]  I review content. I review packages. What? I don't review packages. You want to fight? You
[9051.56s -> 9061.32s]  want to fight? Don't fuck with that. So here's like, here's a cup. This cup is good. There's a whole
[9061.32s -> 9067.72s]  lot of stuff here though. I have my fun. I have my professional side. I mold them together into
[9067.72s -> 9073.48s]  sort of this lunacy that is Jerma985. So hopefully this little trailer will be able to give you an
[9073.48s -> 9078.04s]  explanation of Mr. Jerma and hopefully you subscribe. What? You have to use this. So please
[9078.04s -> 9088.52s]  subscribe, subscribe. Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready.
[9105.74s -> 9157.08s]  Oh, Honda Civic. Wait, what?
[9159.14s -> 9176.52s]  This didn't happen. I'm still in like 40th place. You understand?
[9236.34s -> 9238.10s]  Oh, pass him. Pass him.
[9258.10s -> 9262.34s]  This is just like the first, this is like the first 20 minutes of the movie.
[9262.98s -> 9265.38s]  But the last thing he expected was the full movie.
[9267.30s -> 9272.58s]  You know, I don't think anybody expected this. The rookie sensation came into the season unknown,
[9272.58s -> 9276.90s]  but everyone knows him now. Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup
[9276.90s -> 9283.22s]  and land down a co? The legend, the runner up and the rookie. Three cars, one champion.
[9283.86s -> 9290.38s]  The
[9290.38s -> 9325.46s]  rookie screamer. The full movie. What? Hey, that's just, he just like ripped the band-aid off.
[9326.97s -> 9337.54s]  You just tore the band-aid off. I want to know what happens. Should I just watch the movie?
[9338.58s -> 9368.57s]  Okay, this one's called Jerma985 reunites with Tim CJ Davidson. Turn it up. Turn it up.
[9370.81s -> 9378.65s]  Hey, big smoke. It's me, Carl. Chill, chill. Tim? Tim Davidson? What? Hey, man.
[9380.41s -> 9393.24s]  This is my house. Nah, man. It's my mom's, homie. Hey, mad dog. What you doing up there, fool?
[9394.74s -> 9404.20s]  Earth. Earth. Earth is on fire. I just shit my pants. I can't do it anymore. Motherfucker.
[9404.20s -> 9421.16s]  Get a grip. You still got it? You still gangsta? Some of these just end with just the most
[9421.16s -> 9440.23s]  abrupt fucking endings possible. This one's called Jerma Interacting with Chat, and this is going to
[9440.23s -> 9450.06s]  be really, really fucking weird. This is another one of those scary deep fakes. Here we go.
[9462.52s -> 9470.42s]  I'm standing here. You make the move. You make the move.
[9471.22s -> 9494.86s]  It's your move. I'm trying. You talking to me? You talking to me? You talking to me? Oh, it's
[9494.86s -> 9502.63s]  fucked up. Who the hell else are you talking to? You talking to me? Well, I'm the only one here.
[9502.63s -> 9512.79s]  Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? Oh, yeah? Okay.
[9512.79s -> 9528.31s]  Okay. It's just scary. It's just, you know, the worst thing about deep fakes
[9529.51s -> 9535.43s]  is if, if you sent this to, if you sent this to my grandmother,
[9538.14s -> 9544.81s]  she would think this was me standing here doing this. You'd be like, what is this? Why, why, why?
[9547.61s -> 9552.09s]  Why does he, why does he have a gun? That's not the grandson that I raised.
[9552.81s -> 9558.26s]  I don't think this is real. My grandmother would think this is real. That's where we're going.
[9558.26s -> 9569.42s]  Send it to your grandmother. What in the name of God would I send that to my grandmother for?
[9570.30s -> 9593.53s]  His mom's called, uh, Jerma is the newest Avenger. Half-life.
[9627.35s -> 9631.03s]  Quickest to a salad you ever made. Here we go. Slap it a couple of times. One, two, three.
[9631.67s -> 9636.31s]  Easy as pie. Just a thing, the thing to clean it. It opens up like a waterfall.
[9636.31s -> 9641.19s]  See? Take a look at that. See? It's easy. No, no, no mess. No bullshit. Throw it in the
[9641.19s -> 9649.64s]  fucking sink behind me. What? Slap it a couple of times. One, two, three.
[9649.64s -> 9653.88s]  What? What? Why? What was the point of that? Two, three.
[9653.88s -> 9661.37s]  Got to use the clip somehow. Oh, right. Yeah. I did. Did I, did I do this in front of the green
[9661.45s -> 9683.26s]  screen? I don't remember even saying that. I did. Uh, this is called a compact turnabout.
[9683.26s -> 9688.62s]  This is an Ace Attorney thing. This is not the same one we saw last time, right? Let's see.
[9716.44s -> 9717.80s]  A box or something. Yeah.
[9720.12s -> 9724.50s]  That's very short. He was even having trouble climbing to the box.
[9725.46s -> 9738.76s]  Hey, it's me, Jerma, from the downtown of Center Sports. I'm downtown. I'm a Tuber.
[9740.76s -> 9741.64s]  Sitting down.
[9747.64s -> 9755.62s]  What's that mean? What's that mean? What's that mean? What's that mean?
[9756.42s -> 9757.14s]  What's that mean?
[9757.14s -> 9802.41s]  I'm an influencer, not a Tuber. That's not all. It also says I, uh, performed at this conundrum.
[9810.14s -> 9819.91s]  Why is it a fucking Egypt? What? No, no, no, no. I like Egypt. Please, please.
[9821.27s -> 9823.91s]  That's a double. That's a double bullshit.
[9826.87s -> 9832.63s]  Nice. There's infinite options, huh? You can do whatever you want in this movie maker.
[9833.34s -> 9844.38s]  Yeah. That was, that was a double end the, end the video bullshit. I can't believe it. We,
[9844.38s -> 9849.43s]  we got the trick to you, flog pyro, and then explosion. And then you got Vinny at the end.
[9853.85s -> 9861.50s]  That was fucking crazy. It was a triple bullshit. You can do anything. React to his reaction.
[9862.06s -> 9874.47s]  Is that good? No. Oh, let's get it again. Nice. There's infinite options, huh? You can do
[9874.47s -> 9890.38s]  whatever you want in this movie maker. Right. Cool. I made a cover of a giant enemy spider
[9890.38s -> 9896.82s]  in a low effort pixel animation. React harder. I don't fucking know how to react. You guys,
[9896.82s -> 9899.30s]  don't you guys know that by now? I don't fucking know how to react to anything.
[9900.94s -> 9907.98s]  My reactions on these streams are this. Or I lean forward and laugh really hard. Or I go
[9913.53s -> 9922.76s]  react, react, react. I'm doing it again. All right. You said you were fast. I did say I was fast.
[9936.57s -> 9962.74s]  Okay. I can't do that again. Okay. I got like full of fucking muscle.
[9964.26s -> 9975.56s]  Holy fuck. Yeah. So you want to talk about how you don't, you don't think, you don't think I have
[9975.56s -> 9983.91s]  the fucking speed. Physical therapy down the drain. No, I did like a burst. That wasn't a turn.
[9983.91s -> 9990.60s]  I'm all right. I'm fine. Don't worry. Is this called, let's go to German. Let's just do a solid bop.
[10005.72s -> 10013.22s]  No, don't turn it off. It's a great song. Don't turn it off. It's a great song.
[10013.78s -> 10019.82s]  Oh shit. I was supposed to do that. A lot of people that are just trickling into this stream,
[10019.82s -> 10024.38s]  but I had just probably like, this is like, what is it? This is, it's an explanation I can't give
[10024.38s -> 10034.23s]  you. This is, uh, I think we've seen this one before, but this is germ of friends.
[10050.46s -> 10065.80s]  Why is this auto playing? This one's called small enemy spider. It looks like an animation.
[10065.96s -> 10071.45s]  Wait a minute. Holy shit. There's a small enemy spider.
[10083.78s -> 10110.98s]  I just die. That's videos. I just die.
[10114.06s -> 10115.69s]  Shit. Hold on.
[10137.40s -> 10153.90s]  This one's called Jerma's nightmare. Skipped a video. What are you talking about?
[10153.98s -> 10175.67s]  What are you talking about? When he skipped a video, he skipped a pixel. What? Are you sure?
[10175.67s -> 10193.69s]  Where? Pixel. When, when, when did I skip it? Three videos ago? Wait, what?
[10194.65s -> 10206.94s]  You were showing us your speed. Oh, and I just, we just didn't watch the video. Oh, okay. Wait.
[10206.94s -> 10211.98s]  I, so I just like skipped it. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Sorry. I'm trying to pick.
[10211.98s -> 10218.84s]  All right. Somebody link it right now. I thought you meant like I hit like the,
[10218.84s -> 10231.05s]  all right. I see what you're saying. I was too fast. Let me see this. Oh, okay. Right.
[10231.05s -> 10238.15s]  I'm sitting here going like, what are they talking about? My brain is so fucking small. Here we go.
[10257.80s -> 10260.20s]  What is this up here? That's not a spider, is it?
[10260.20s -> 10284.76s]  It is a spider. That's scary, dude. Dude. Fuck, dude. Dude. Oh, there you go. Sorry that I almost
[10284.76s -> 10292.66s]  fucking just did, just deleted it for my brain. That's how you can tell that I have an actual
[10292.66s -> 10301.70s]  goldfish memory. This is Jerma's nightmare. I had a dream last night that I was sponsored by this
[10301.70s -> 10306.58s]  company that makes this wallet. And I was nervously doing a presentation for it. And there
[10306.58s -> 10313.06s]  were like 30,000 people here for some reason. And it was just a wall, a spam of like, I'm
[10313.06s -> 10329.78s]  fucking out of here. I'm something you piece of shit. This opens store cards. It's a good wallet.
[10329.78s -> 10333.70s]  It is. And it looks like an SSD. There's all kinds of styles.
[10343.94s -> 10350.26s]  Really good. They're very good. They're secure. They fit into pants. You can actually put this
[10350.26s -> 10356.18s]  into like a jacket pocket. You put your essentials in here. It's light. It's got a nice click to it.
[10356.98s -> 10360.34s]  It's very sturdy. What is happening?
[10402.31s -> 10404.15s]  What the fuck is going on?
[10404.79s -> 10434.17s]  Who put that in there?
[10434.17s -> 10445.43s]  This is a crack video.
[10445.43s -> 10447.43s]  I'm gonna do it with two hands.
[10447.43s -> 10449.43s]  Everyone dies.
[10479.85s -> 10481.85s]  It's time for you to pay.
[10483.85s -> 10495.62s]  Is this a Jojo thing? Jojo?
[10496.26s -> 10498.57s]  Something that I care about. Something that I want to show.
[10498.57s -> 10501.26s]  That I haven't had the opportunity to do it until now.
[10501.26s -> 10506.76s]  That's me on my fishing trip.
[10506.76s -> 10508.76s]  Go through. Get out of here.
[10508.76s -> 10513.03s]  I'll see you Sunday.
[10513.03s -> 10523.02s]  Hey!
[10523.02s -> 10525.64s]  Jesus.
[10525.64s -> 10536.58s]  Meme vomit.
[10536.58s -> 10538.95s]  It's like this is another full minute.
[10538.95s -> 10540.95s]  Are you kidding me? That isn't what happened.
[10540.95s -> 10543.13s]  That is not what happened. That's exactly what happened.
[10543.13s -> 10545.13s]  What are you talking about? No it's not.
[10545.13s -> 10547.13s]  That was bullshit. This is what really happened.
[10547.77s -> 10556.47s]  Jojo.
[10556.47s -> 10560.89s]  What am I about? Wait.
[10560.89s -> 10562.89s]  When did I say this?
[10562.89s -> 10565.90s]  Alright. Spoilers for Jojo.
[10565.90s -> 10567.90s]  I mean we only got 20 seconds left, guy.
[10567.90s -> 10571.22s]  Alright. Spoilers for Jojo.
[10571.22s -> 10573.22s]  I said. At some point.
[10573.22s -> 10575.22s]  If you haven't seen it yet.
[10575.22s -> 10577.22s]  If you have.
[10577.22s -> 10579.22s]  Jojo.
[10579.22s -> 10581.22s]  Jojo.
[10581.22s -> 10583.22s]  Not one of you has not seen it.
[10583.22s -> 10585.22s]  But mute for the next 45 minutes.
[10585.86s -> 10587.86s]  What about me?
[10587.86s -> 10589.86s]  What about me? I haven't seen it.
[10589.86s -> 10591.86s]  What about me?
[10591.86s -> 10606.18s]  Should I mute?
[10606.18s -> 10609.26s]  Alright. I'm going to look away.
[10609.26s -> 10611.26s]  Those of you that have seen the show. You can keep watching.
[10611.26s -> 10613.26s]  Those of you that haven't seen the show.
[10613.26s -> 10615.26s]  Look away. And take out your earphones.
[10615.26s -> 10617.26s]  Ok. 3. 2. 1.
[10617.26s -> 10658.15s]  Go.
[10658.15s -> 10661.35s]  Alright.
[10661.35s -> 10663.35s]  We have this one.
[10663.35s -> 10665.35s]  This is another animated show.
[10665.35s -> 10667.35s]  If you haven't seen.
[10667.99s -> 10669.99s]  This is from Attack on Titan.
[10669.99s -> 10671.99s]  This is 30 seconds.
[10671.99s -> 10673.99s]  This is called German invades castle.
[10673.99s -> 10676.68s]  Just want to make sure.
[10676.68s -> 10678.68s]  If you have never seen it.
[10678.68s -> 10680.68s]  Just the words that I just said 5 seconds ago.
[10680.68s -> 10685.03s]  If you have never seen it. Who cares.
[10685.03s -> 10689.45s]  Here we go.
[10689.45s -> 10691.69s]  I deleted everything.
[10691.69s -> 10693.69s]  This is kind of it.
[10693.69s -> 10695.69s]  I just hit the backwards button.
[10695.69s -> 10697.69s]  With everything selected.
[10697.69s -> 10702.10s]  Sorry.
[10702.10s -> 10704.10s]  I don't want you to see my pores.
[10704.74s -> 10706.74s]  I know. I know.
[10706.74s -> 10708.74s]  Screen camera is going to shit.
[10717.51s -> 10719.51s]  This one was funny.
[10719.51s -> 10721.51s]  They've all been good.
[10721.51s -> 10735.40s]  This one was funny.
[10735.40s -> 10737.70s]  Coming up next.
[10737.70s -> 10739.70s]  We have a video called.
[10739.70s -> 10741.70s]  The impressive scale of our universe.
[10745.91s -> 10748.73s]  Let's see what our universe looks like.
[10748.73s -> 10755.58s]  I bet you anything.
[10755.58s -> 10757.58s]  I'm as small as the smallest atom.
[10759.82s -> 10761.82s]  I already know what it is.
[10761.82s -> 10763.82s]  I already see it. I've already seen this video.
[10763.82s -> 10769.19s]  I guarantee you that's what happens.
[10769.19s -> 10771.19s]  There's no way.
[10771.19s -> 10773.19s]  That we don't go into like.
[10773.19s -> 10775.19s]  0.00500th of a percent of a micron.
[10775.19s -> 10777.19s]  And not be standing there T posing.
[10777.19s -> 10796.63s]  Right? Has to be.
[10796.63s -> 10798.63s]  Wait for it. Yeah.
[10798.63s -> 10800.63s]  We're going to go through the whole thing.
[10800.63s -> 10802.63s]  This is how big everything fucking is.
[10802.63s -> 10828.62s]  Let's zoom way in.
[10828.62s -> 10830.62s]  Pay attention.
[10830.62s -> 10832.62s]  I know how the video ends.
[10833.26s -> 10893.78s]  Anticipation is killing me.
[10893.78s -> 10905.69s]  Almost there.
[10905.69s -> 10912.41s]  And T pose. Got it.
[10912.41s -> 10914.41s]  I'm tiny.
[10914.41s -> 10928.94s]  I'm fucking tiny.
[10928.94s -> 10930.94s]  I can smell that one from a fucking mile away.
[10930.94s -> 10936.82s]  You have appeased us goblin.
[10936.82s -> 10938.82s]  Thank you.
[10938.82s -> 10940.82s]  How long is that video? 2 minutes and 47 seconds.
[10940.82s -> 10944.33s]  Alright coming up next.
[10944.33s -> 10946.95s]  We are going to move on to music.
[10946.95s -> 10951.69s]  I'm going to hang out for a little bit.
[10951.69s -> 10956.81s]  Let's go to conclude the video section.
[10956.81s -> 10961.03s]  We had to fucking end on that one.
[10961.67s -> 10965.70s]  And now we get to do.
[10965.70s -> 10969.86s]  Something that I'm not looking forward to.
[10969.86s -> 10979.27s]  What's going to happen for the next few.
[10979.27s -> 10981.27s]  I want to do music first.
[10981.27s -> 10987.42s]  Because I'm about to do.
[10987.42s -> 10989.42s]  I'm about to turn on the winks.
[10989.42s -> 10991.42s]  They're going to be discounted.
[10991.42s -> 10993.42s]  I think it's going to be like.
[10993.42s -> 10995.42s]  10,000 or 20.
[10995.42s -> 10997.42s]  No. No. No. 20,000. 20,000.
[10997.42s -> 10999.42s]  20,000. 10,000.
[10999.42s -> 11005.69s]  Alright 10,000 for a wink.
[11005.69s -> 11007.69s]  We're going to listen to music.
[11007.69s -> 11009.69s]  And just fucking wink into the.
[11010.33s -> 11021.02s]  Embarrassing pain in the ass isn't it?
[11021.02s -> 11023.51s]  Okay. Hold on.
[11023.51s -> 11029.19s]  Hold on.
[11029.19s -> 11031.19s]  I am about to turn it on.
[11031.19s -> 11035.74s]  Don't use it yet.
[11035.74s -> 11051.53s]  I need to be able to keep track of this shit.
[11051.53s -> 11053.53s]  Alright. I'm going to listen to some music.
[11053.53s -> 11055.53s]  And just hang out.
[11055.53s -> 11058.86s]  And fuck this. A bunch of people here.
[11058.86s -> 11061.86s]  And these people are going to be like.
[11061.86s -> 11063.86s]  There's a lot of people here right now.
[11063.86s -> 11079.29s]  And I'm going to do this now?
[11079.29s -> 11105.72s]  Wait. Holy shit.
[11105.72s -> 11109.94s]  Should have made it 50.
[11110.82s -> 11113.06s]  Should have made it 50.
[11113.06s -> 11160.98s]  I turned it off.
[11160.98s -> 11164.44s]  I think there are.
[11164.44s -> 11168.71s]  Let's see.
[11168.71s -> 11170.71s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
[11170.71s -> 11172.71s]  10, 11, 12, 13,
[11172.71s -> 11174.71s]  14.
[11174.71s -> 11177.72s]  Are there any.
[11177.72s -> 11179.72s]  Mods.
[11179.72s -> 11181.96s]  That are in the channel right now.
[11181.96s -> 11183.96s]  That.
[11183.96s -> 11185.96s]  Anybody have any.
[11187.96s -> 11190.14s]  Data on how many that just was.
[11190.78s -> 11195.45s]  That was a lot.
[11195.45s -> 11206.07s]  It was probably
[11206.07s -> 11208.07s]  2 or 3. It was like 3 or 400.
[11208.07s -> 11211.08s]  It was 400.
[11211.08s -> 11213.08s]  Grump.
[11213.08s -> 11215.08s]  If you have any awareness or access
[11215.08s -> 11217.08s]  to how many times somebody just redeemed a link.
[11217.08s -> 11219.08s]  It was like
[11219.08s -> 11221.08s]  hundreds and hundreds of fucking times.
[11221.08s -> 11225.18s]  I think it was like 400 and something.
[11225.18s -> 11227.18s]  543.
[11227.18s -> 11229.18s]  543 times.
[11229.18s -> 11241.08s]  Okay.
[11241.08s -> 11255.35s]  I need like a counter.
[11258.22s -> 11260.22s]  I'm like practicing.
[11260.22s -> 11263.80s]  I'm like going to prepare for this.
[11263.80s -> 11275.62s]  Okay.
[11275.62s -> 11277.62s]  One blink counts as 2?
[11277.62s -> 11279.62s]  No, no, no, no. Does it? Yeah, it does.
[11279.62s -> 11287.75s]  No? What do you mean no?
[11287.75s -> 11289.75s]  Oh my fucking god. I can't believe that.
[11289.75s -> 11291.75s]  Am I? I'm not like the. I'm not like the top
[11291.75s -> 11293.75s]  row of just chatting right now.
[11293.75s -> 11298.17s]  And I'm going to wink count?
[11298.17s -> 11300.17s]  Hey, come on out of German. I hit 5.
[11300.17s -> 11302.17s]  Where I go like this. Click. Click.
[11302.17s -> 11305.05s]  543 fucking times.
[11305.05s -> 11308.12s]  Oh, I did this to myself.
[11308.76s -> 11314.97s]  I did this to myself.
[11314.97s -> 11327.50s]  Hold on. Hold on. Give us the winks.
[11327.50s -> 11329.50s]  Alright. Hold on. Wait. Wait. I gotta move.
[11329.50s -> 11335.83s]  I have to move something.
[11335.83s -> 11338.58s]  Because we still have music to do.
[11338.58s -> 11341.14s]  I still want to play the music.
[11341.14s -> 11343.32s]  I'm getting this over with right now.
[11343.32s -> 11362.39s]  And winks are dead forever. They're not coming back.
[11362.39s -> 11392.79s]  Oh man. Oh man. Oh man.
[11392.79s -> 11395.67s]  The music?
[11395.67s -> 11397.67s]  I'm almost halfway there. I'm fine.
[11397.67s -> 11399.67s]  What do you mean music? Oh, you want fucking music?
[11399.67s -> 11401.67s]  Fine. We'll play some fucking music.
[11401.67s -> 11438.26s]  Okay. I missed one.
[11438.26s -> 11451.05s]  What was that? Put on thunderstruck?
[11451.05s -> 11456.81s]  Was it like just a kid talking?
[11456.81s -> 11461.86s]  No. No. We're not at 21.
[11461.86s -> 11463.86s]  We're at 63.
[11463.86s -> 11465.86s]  You have to catch up.
[11465.86s -> 11467.86s]  Click on source.
[11467.86s -> 11469.86s]  You're watching in like 360p. You're like 4 minutes behind.
[11479.70s -> 11481.70s]  I'll make this go so much faster.
[11481.70s -> 11547.56s]  If I do this.
[11547.56s -> 11549.56s]  There's an intro before the intro.
[11549.56s -> 11551.56s]  I just want sound effects.
[11551.56s -> 11617.26s]  I'm close.
[11617.26s -> 11619.26s]  He's going crazy.
[11619.26s -> 11621.56s]  This is performance art?
[11621.56s -> 11625.59s]  No. This is called making a mistake.
[11625.59s -> 11627.59s]  This is called making a mistake.
[11627.59s -> 11629.59s]  Minus 400 viewers.
[11629.59s -> 11681.11s]  Oh fuck.
[11681.11s -> 11683.11s]  It's replaying them.
[11683.11s -> 11703.78s]  We need a better playlist.
[11703.78s -> 11708.71s]  Do thunderstruck?
[11708.71s -> 11711.46s]  Hey lady.
[11711.46s -> 11714.20s]  Nope. We're staying here.
[11714.20s -> 11718.02s]  Oh babe. I am.
[11718.02s -> 11726.14s]  Yeah baby.
[11726.14s -> 11728.14s]  Okay. We actually are moving on.
[11728.14s -> 11736.78s]  I'll get this all done in one
[11736.78s -> 11738.78s]  thunderstruck.
[11738.78s -> 11740.78s]  I'll get this done in one thunderstruck.
[11740.78s -> 11744.42s]  543?

[11751.85s -> 11753.85s]  Like can I like put water in my eyes
[11753.85s -> 11755.85s]  to like lubricate them?
[11755.85s -> 11761.86s]  That's okay right?
[11761.86s -> 11763.86s]  Okay. Don't do that.
[11763.86s -> 11768.02s]  At least let me lubricate something.
[11768.02s -> 11822.73s]  I gotta get ready for this.
[11822.73s -> 11824.73s]  Hold on.
[11824.73s -> 11826.73s]  These bleeding viewers.
[11826.73s -> 11828.73s]  Do you think people are going to want to stay?
[11828.73s -> 11908.46s]  TikTok!
[11908.46s -> 11919.40s]  What do you mean they don't count?
[11919.40s -> 11922.39s]  I'm getting sleepy.
[11922.39s -> 11924.39s]  Okay. It's itchy.
[11924.39s -> 11926.57s]  It's itchy right now.
[11926.57s -> 11928.57s]  My eyes are wicked itchy.
[11928.57s -> 11931.58s]  They're bleeding?
[11931.58s -> 11938.55s]  I'm not bleeding.
[11938.55s -> 11941.11s]  No. It's just itchy.
[11941.11s -> 11943.11s]  It's wicked itchy. Oh no. I know why.
[11943.11s -> 11945.11s]  Because I touched this.
[11945.11s -> 11947.48s]  I'm fine.
[11947.48s -> 11949.48s]  I'm getting an irritated eye from winking.
[11953.26s -> 11955.26s]  Imagine winking yourself into an allergy.
[11955.26s -> 11957.43s]  Holy shit man.
[11957.43s -> 11959.61s]  What the?
[11959.61s -> 11982.90s]  Alright when you do this like
[11982.90s -> 11984.90s]  400 fucking times.
[11984.90s -> 11986.90s]  It starts to blend together.
[11986.90s -> 11988.90s]  It starts to blend together like
[11988.90s -> 11990.90s]  an itchy eye. Hold on.
[11990.90s -> 11994.81s]  This is fucked up.
[11994.81s -> 11998.46s]  Hey.
[11998.46s -> 12000.82s]  Is it fucked up that I'm doing it?
[12000.82s -> 12003.64s]  Fucked up that you're here watching it.
[12003.64s -> 12005.88s]  Which one?
[12005.88s -> 12017.21s]  I gotta help myself here. Ready?
[12017.21s -> 12027.51s]  It's becoming hard to do.
[12027.51s -> 12034.68s]  I'm gonna end up with like
[12034.68s -> 12036.68s]  big eyebrow muscles.
[12036.68s -> 12038.68s]  I'm gonna have huge ass eyebrow
[12038.68s -> 12040.68s]  with like cheek muscles from this.
[12040.68s -> 12042.68s]  I'm like working out muscles up here
[12042.68s -> 12044.68s]  that I've never worked out in my life.
[12044.68s -> 12046.98s]  I'm gonna get like big
[12046.98s -> 12073.16s]  jacked under eyes.
[12073.16s -> 12075.16s]  This guy's an egomaniac.
[12075.16s -> 12079.70s]  No he's just an idiot.
[12079.70s -> 12082.39s]  That continues to fuck up stuff.
[12082.39s -> 12086.68s]  Super Saiyan 3.
[12086.68s -> 12092.06s]  Both?
[12092.06s -> 12095.06s]  He's normally just dumb.
[12095.06s -> 12102.23s]  We're almost there.
[12102.23s -> 12139.67s]  Play us out.
[12139.67s -> 12141.67s]  500. What was it?
[12141.67s -> 12143.67s]  Oh it was 543. Fuck.
[12143.67s -> 12188.79s]  555.
[12188.79s -> 12190.79s]  I did extra because some of those were blinks.
[12190.79s -> 12193.03s]  Alright now excuse me.
[12193.03s -> 12195.03s]  I'm going to go throw up.
[12195.03s -> 12209.99s]  I did it. Ding ding ding.
[12209.99s -> 12211.99s]  I won.
[12211.99s -> 12213.99s]  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
[12213.99s -> 12217.19s]  Winks by the way are gone.
[12217.19s -> 12225.64s]  They're not coming back.
[12225.64s -> 12227.64s]  Anyways we have some music to listen to.
[12227.64s -> 12231.67s]  I'm gonna be watching everybody.
[12231.67s -> 12236.54s]  I'm gonna come back to camera now.
[12236.54s -> 12240.06s]  We're just gonna chill and listen to some music.
[12240.06s -> 12243.83s]  While we do the bits.
[12243.83s -> 12245.83s]  That sounds like a good place to put it.
[12245.83s -> 12248.65s]  I'm gonna replace it with something more fun.
[12248.65s -> 12250.65s]  I'm replacing it with stuff like what we did yesterday.
[12250.65s -> 12252.89s]  If you were here yesterday
[12252.89s -> 12254.89s]  that is more
[12254.89s -> 12256.89s]  fun to me.
[12256.89s -> 12258.89s]  Than just dump like
[12258.89s -> 12260.89s]  20-30 thousand points
[12260.89s -> 12262.89s]  and like streamers said something.
[12262.89s -> 12265.26s]  Or winks into camera.
[12265.26s -> 12267.26s]  I actually have like little fun games.
[12267.26s -> 12272.76s]  You know what I mean?
[12272.76s -> 12276.97s]  The idea.
[12276.97s -> 12281.32s]  We're gonna do the, how many points for
[12281.32s -> 12286.38s]  Nancy Drew stream.
[12286.38s -> 12288.38s]  Please play Joel's movie in time.
[12288.38s -> 12290.62s]  Have you watched the 3D movie maker movie?
[12290.62s -> 12296.18s]  Oh I haven't no.
[12296.18s -> 12298.18s]  Alright well that's the last thing that we're gonna do.
[12298.18s -> 12301.06s]  We're gonna end the stream
[12301.06s -> 12303.06s]  with Joel's 3D movie maker movie.
[12303.06s -> 12312.02s]  But not now. Not yet.
[12312.02s -> 12317.02s]  Let's listen to some music first.
[12317.02s -> 12319.02s]  While we do the bits and stuff.
[12319.02s -> 12321.02s]  Actually no we should probably hold off.
[12321.02s -> 12323.02s]  Because it's gonna be like another 20-30 minutes right?
[12323.02s -> 12326.28s]  Yeah let's hold off.
[12326.28s -> 12331.51s]  Let's play some music.
[12331.51s -> 12333.51s]  This is some giant enemy spider music.
[12333.51s -> 12339.02s]  That we're gonna listen to right now.
[12339.02s -> 12341.02s]  Here's this first one.
[12341.02s -> 12352.39s]  This actually is pretty sick.
[12352.39s -> 12363.91s]  This is actually pretty good.
[12363.91s -> 12365.91s]  This is actually pretty good.
[12365.91s -> 12376.47s]  Right now Nintendo owns this.
[12376.47s -> 12379.61s]  I think they owned it before too.
[12379.61s -> 12402.46s]  Bopping.
[12402.46s -> 12404.46s]  Look at this. This sounds pretty good.
[12404.46s -> 12420.58s]  That's why I'm ice fine.
[12420.58s -> 12431.59s]  End of the stream.
[12431.59s -> 12433.59s]  Well I mean technically this is the end of the stream.
[12433.59s -> 12436.41s]  We're doing a bonus end.
[12436.41s -> 12438.71s]  We're gonna watch Joel's movie.
[12438.71s -> 12447.42s]  This next one is very very interesting.
[12447.42s -> 12449.98s]  This is called
[12449.98s -> 12457.14s]  Kids With Rats.
[12457.14s -> 12459.14s]  You know that thing how the rat song goes
[12459.14s -> 12461.14s]  literally with everything?
[12461.14s -> 12463.14s]  It's pretty cool actually.
[12463.14s -> 12465.14s]  It's pretty cool actually.
[12465.14s -> 12467.64s]  It's pretty cool actually.
[12467.64s -> 12471.66s]  It's pretty cool actually.
[12471.66s -> 12495.14s]  That's good shit.
[12495.14s -> 12498.79s]  Link, link, link, link, link, link.
[12498.79s -> 12501.61s]  Here's Link.
[12501.61s -> 12505.64s]  There you go. That was really good.
[12505.64s -> 12508.90s]  Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, Zelda.
[12508.90s -> 12510.90s]  This one's called Giant Enemy Spider 11.
[12510.90s -> 12513.72s]  The giant enemy spider.
[12513.72s -> 12515.72s]  The giant enemy spider.
[12515.72s -> 12524.36s]  Isn't this 11 seconds?
[12524.36s -> 12528.14s]  Hey, giant
[12528.14s -> 12530.31s]  enemy spider.
[12530.31s -> 12532.31s]  Wait, Jerma screams.
[12532.31s -> 12536.09s]  So handsome.
[12536.09s -> 12541.59s]  I'm the most handsome person you've ever met.
[12541.59s -> 12543.59s]  What the fuck is that guy?
[12543.59s -> 12546.02s]  They fucking scream.
[12546.02s -> 12548.02s]  I never
[12548.02s -> 12550.02s]  scream like that.
[12554.20s -> 12556.20s]  I'm a fan of that person.
[12556.20s -> 12564.06s]  God, shut up already.
[12564.06s -> 12566.06s]  What? I just turned it on.
[12566.06s -> 12568.06s]  What are you talking about?
[12568.06s -> 12570.62s]  Oh yeah, somebody did that recently.
[12570.62s -> 12572.62s]  I remember that. I turned the stream on
[12572.62s -> 12574.62s]  and I started talking about, like, they love doing the intro.
[12574.62s -> 12576.62s]  And somebody was like, dude, shut the fuck up already.
[12576.62s -> 12578.62s]  Dude, just shut up already.
[12578.62s -> 12580.62s]  I just turned on the stream.
[12580.62s -> 12582.62s]  I remember that.
[12582.62s -> 12585.69s]  It's like, I just turned on the
[12585.69s -> 12587.69s]  fucking broadcast.
[12587.69s -> 12589.69s]  You're going to be here for at least,
[12589.69s -> 12591.69s]  you're going to have to listen to me for at least four to eight
[12591.69s -> 12593.69s]  hours, depending on how I feel that day.
[12593.69s -> 12599.38s]  This next one's called Giant Enemy Spider
[12599.38s -> 12602.01s]  Remix.
[12602.01s -> 12604.01s]  The giant enemy spider.
[12604.01s -> 12606.01s]  Giant enemy spider
[12606.01s -> 12618.30s]  remix.
[12618.30s -> 12647.02s]  Seriously.
[12647.02s -> 12673.11s]  Link, I actually
[12673.11s -> 12675.11s]  don't have a link for this one because
[12675.11s -> 12677.11s]  it was embedded directly into Discord.
[12677.11s -> 12682.09s]  Let me see
[12682.09s -> 12684.09s]  if I can get it.
[12684.09s -> 12742.18s]  This is good.
[12742.18s -> 12755.94s]  What going on in this one?
[12755.94s -> 12772.52s]  Trying to find it. It's right here somewhere.
[12772.52s -> 12778.92s]  Hold on.
[12783.80s -> 12786.42s]  Oh, with the ending too, with the old
[12786.42s -> 12791.80s]  ending sound.
[12791.80s -> 12795.45s]  Yeah, even with, hold on.
[12795.45s -> 12797.45s]  Even with the, if I found it in Discord,
[12797.45s -> 12800.52s]  you'd have to go to the community
[12800.52s -> 12802.52s]  content section
[12802.52s -> 12806.79s]  and pull it from there.
[12806.79s -> 12808.79s]  Let me get the exact name of it though.
[12808.79s -> 12815.70s]  Somebody, oh, you got it, somebody has it right now?
[12815.70s -> 12818.97s]  You got it? Is that it?
[12818.97s -> 12827.10s]  Oh, they don't. Shit. Okay.
[12827.10s -> 12830.49s]  Yeah, because I had to save this and just
[12830.49s -> 12832.49s]  play it through the computer.
[12832.49s -> 12834.49s]  So, if we can get maybe somebody
[12834.49s -> 12836.49s]  one of the mods or something maybe
[12836.49s -> 12838.49s]  where somebody can find it.
[12838.49s -> 12840.79s]  Because I just tried to scroll through and couldn't see it.
[12840.79s -> 12843.35s]  Oh, there you go. Okay.
[12843.35s -> 12845.91s]  Yeah, it's in the
[12845.91s -> 12847.91s]  stream chat in stream related
[12847.91s -> 12851.11s]  category. Cool. There we go. That was really
[12851.11s -> 12858.73s]  fucking good. Now,
[12858.73s -> 12864.42s]  without further ado,
[12864.42s -> 12867.05s]  we're going to do,
[12867.05s -> 12871.32s]  we're going to watch Joel's
[12871.32s -> 12876.23s]  video.
[12876.23s -> 12878.23s]  Does somebody have a link to the 3D movie maker movie?
[12878.23s -> 12885.02s]  This is it. Link this.
[12885.02s -> 12887.32s]  Hurry. Why
[12887.32s -> 12892.12s]  are you in a hurry?
[12892.12s -> 12894.12s]  The giant enemy spider.
[12894.12s -> 12896.12s]  Spider on me like the Spider-Man.
[12896.12s -> 12898.12s]  This is not it.
[12898.12s -> 12900.12s]  Link this.
[12900.12s -> 12902.12s]  Hurry.
[12902.12s -> 12904.12s]  I do not want the cooties, man.
[12904.12s -> 12906.12s]  Spider on me like the Spider-Man.
[12906.12s -> 12908.12s]  I've been jumping higher than I head up on a single fan.
[12908.12s -> 12910.12s]  Quick, link it.
[12910.12s -> 12912.12s]  I don't want you
[12912.12s -> 12914.12s]  I do not want the cooties, man. I think we've heard
[12914.12s -> 12916.36s]  this already. It's pretty good.
[12916.36s -> 12920.26s]  Real link. Yeah,
[12920.26s -> 12922.26s]  we've heard that already.
[12922.26s -> 12929.30s]  You motherfucker.
[12929.30s -> 12937.94s]  Okay, here we go. Let's pull this back.
[12937.94s -> 12942.30s]  We're going to watch this movie.
[12942.30s -> 12950.17s]  I need to get like a snack or something.
[12950.17s -> 12952.17s]  Oh, do I need like a snack for this?
[12952.17s -> 12960.74s]  Just eat your nails.
[12960.74s -> 12962.74s]  Alright, I'll be right back. I'm going to
[12962.74s -> 12965.05s]  get like a water.
[12965.05s -> 12967.05s]  The stream is technically over.
[12967.05s -> 12969.22s]  Alright, technically. Cause we're just
[12969.22s -> 12971.22s]  watching Joel's movie and we're going to scroll through some other stuff
[12971.22s -> 12973.22s]  too. And do the bits and everything.
[12973.22s -> 12975.22s]  So I'll be right back.
[12975.22s -> 12977.22s]  In fact, I'm just going to go to the screen because
[12977.22s -> 12979.72s]  this is more accurate. I'll be right back.
[12979.72s -> 13101.19s]  Okay.
[13101.19s -> 13103.94s]  This is called the Blue
[13103.94s -> 13107.02s]  Shell Incident.
[13107.02s -> 13109.02s]  This is what this is called.
[13109.02s -> 13122.90s]  Hold on, let me get it in the right spot.
[13122.90s -> 13134.87s]  We need a React
[13134.87s -> 13137.82s]  Cam. Oh, you don't need a
[13137.82s -> 13147.86s]  React Cam, do you?
[13147.86s -> 13149.86s]  Alright, hold on. You want a React
[13149.86s -> 13153.00s]  Cam? Let me just fix my hair so
[13153.00s -> 13155.00s]  I look at least presentable
[13155.00s -> 13157.00s]  on your fucking big screen.
[13157.00s -> 13159.00s]  What's going on in the back of my head here?
[13159.00s -> 13170.50s]  Alright, here we go. This is
[13170.50s -> 13172.50s]  the Blue Shell Incident.
[13172.50s -> 13184.54s]  Just spaghetti on the rocks.
[13184.54s -> 13191.13s]  Don't you get these characters?
[13191.13s -> 13193.13s]  Hey, little bro. Or should I say

[13203.00s -> 13205.82s]  Ah, but that's where you're wrong, bro.
[13205.82s -> 13207.82s]  You see, Blue Shell Incident
[13207.82s -> 13210.25s]  was just a cover up.
[13210.25s -> 13217.80s]  Location,
[13217.80s -> 13219.80s]  Sansibar Island,
[13219.80s -> 13221.80s]  5 PM.
[13221.80s -> 13232.41s]  That was...
[13233.41s -> 13236.93s]  This is Lasagna
[13236.93s -> 13238.93s]  Ocelot, over.
[13238.93s -> 13240.93s]  Commencing Operation Blue
[13240.93s -> 13242.93s]  Shell Kill. How did you get Garfield?
[13242.93s -> 13245.23s]  When did you get a gun?
[13245.23s -> 13247.23s]  And the wood pipe was a Zybrows's ass all
[13247.23s -> 13249.23s]  along, Luigi!
[13249.23s -> 13251.23s]  Hey, uh, do you smell
[13251.23s -> 13253.23s]  Lasagna?
[13253.23s -> 13255.23s]  Hey, Luigi!
[13255.23s -> 13257.23s]  I was talking here!
[13257.23s -> 13266.70s]  What scene is this?
[13266.70s -> 13268.70s]  Well, Luigi, all I gotta say is
[13268.70s -> 13270.70s]  pasta la vista.
[13270.70s -> 13273.65s]  Lasagna doesn't smell Italian.
[13273.65s -> 13275.65s]  All I gotta say, Luigi,
[13275.65s -> 13277.65s]  you go to hell before you die!
[13277.65s -> 13281.49s]  D-d-d-d-d-die?
[13281.49s -> 13287.18s]  I didn't shoot Luigi, we don't kill Luigi,
[13287.18s -> 13289.18s]  do you? Holy fuck.
[13299.62s -> 13302.05s]  That's pretty good.
[13302.05s -> 13304.35s]  That was a pretty good Luigi.
[13311.44s -> 13314.24s]  Today just
[13314.24s -> 13316.24s]  had to be a Monday, huh?
[13316.24s -> 13320.66s]  Oh my god.
[13320.66s -> 13329.30s]  Oh no, it was Mario
[13329.30s -> 13331.30s]  that got shot, not Luigi.
[13347.60s -> 13349.60s]  Blow up the earth. Blow the earth up. Please blow the
[13349.60s -> 13352.35s]  earth up. I know you want to do it. Do it.
[13352.35s -> 13359.12s]  Do it!
[13359.12s -> 13363.09s]  Oh, god damn it.
[13363.09s -> 13368.59s]  I thought we were gonna get an earth explosion.
[13368.59s -> 13370.59s]  That's right, Luigi! It was me
[13370.59s -> 13372.59s]  all along! It's
[13372.59s -> 13374.59s]  me, Mario!
[13374.59s -> 13379.84s]  Yahoo!
[13379.84s -> 13382.21s]  Mario, that's impossible!
[13382.21s -> 13391.23s]  Well, if I can't
[13391.23s -> 13393.23s]  have had any better aim, you'd be dead
[13393.23s -> 13395.23s]  that Monday. I guess
[13395.23s -> 13397.23s]  you could call a Spaghetti up, Luigi!
[13397.23s -> 13399.23s]  But Mario,
[13399.23s -> 13401.23s]  what about the blood?
[13401.23s -> 13403.23s]  Look at my shitty degree.

[14442.05s -> 14450.54s]  brother of mine looking for me little bro Mario yeah say Luigi you ever
[14450.54s -> 14457.85s]  wondered about our memes memes you see Luigi being a plumber it's just a myth
[14457.89s -> 14463.13s]  everything is just a joke we're all pawns controlled by something greater
[14463.13s -> 14470.25s]  can metal gears metal gear so true souls they shape our will they are culture
[14470.25s -> 14475.37s]  they are everything we pass on Luigi I don't understand what you're talking
[14475.37s -> 14481.98s]  about Mario I knew you wouldn't Luigi ever since that day I'm Sam Sabar Luigi I
[14481.98s -> 14487.97s]  could never forgive you what are you talking about Mario when the blue shell
[14487.97s -> 14494.89s]  hit me and I came in last I was humiliated Luigi all because of that all
[14494.89s -> 14501.53s]  of this because of that Mario no true this I've always hated you bro we're
[14501.53s -> 14508.43s]  bros but we're not ordinary bros we're bros linked by cursed memes you you're
[14508.43s -> 14513.65s]  fine you got all the old man's dominant memes I got all the flawed recessive
[14513.65s -> 14521.93s]  memes old man you mean that's right Luigi but enough of that it's time your
[14521.93s -> 14534.98s]  memes end here who's gonna win who wins the battle at the end
[14534.98s -> 14553.96s]  liquid liquid Luigi we'll see about that next week you Luigi classic one
[14553.96s -> 14568.42s]  best of Luigi you know Luigi you make me laugh we're not so different you and I
[14568.42s -> 14574.46s]  were both plumbers we love spaghetti but you know what I like the most about you
[14575.02s -> 14582.48s]  brothers what the fact you never use cheat codes like me thank you so much for
[14582.48s -> 14594.94s]  playing my game and now Luigi you die mother ducker forgot to dig me a grave
[14594.94s -> 14601.25s]  huh look you're alive let's just say I borrowed a few power stores before I
[14601.25s -> 14608.05s]  went Luigi farewell you were the bro I never had I thought I was a Reese's car
[14608.05s -> 14611.81s]  for a second I was like holy shit Reese's
[14632.00s -> 14642.54s]  spaghetti on the rocks you know you remind me of someone mr. duck to ice cubes
[14643.38s -> 14669.34s]  my brother keep the change he said Bane laugh why cuz I had my name is Luigi oh
[14669.34s -> 14691.82s]  my god rather I'm a movie that took a year to make see something that a lot of
[14691.86s -> 14700.75s]  people need to understand this shit this each minute of this is this program is
[14700.75s -> 14709.26s]  not designed to do any of this shit any absolutely zero so trying to manipulate
[14709.26s -> 14715.44s]  this to do any of this it's so hard to do fuck you Windows 10 from was
[14715.44s -> 14734.12s]  destroying this yeah it is post-credit scene
[14734.12s -> 14744.28s]  what's the success no sir operation blue shell kill was indeed a success no sir
[14744.28s -> 14757.15s]  D for lore no yet that's Garfield
[14775.88s -> 14786.53s]  it is so fun to fuck around in this program I was insane even having that
[14786.57s -> 14791.85s]  many people like that many characters is sitting like in one place is just so
[14791.85s -> 14798.13s]  it's so annoying to manipulate stuff you're not subbed I thought I've logged
[14798.13s -> 14806.68s]  in I haven't been logged into my YouTube channel in fucking like a half decade
[14806.68s -> 14832.10s]  I'm not logged in that was fucking crazy though and I know my password I'm glad
[14832.14s -> 14842.65s]  I finally get to see it we spent was a 26 minute film we just saw and that's
[14842.65s -> 14850.93s]  gonna bring us to the actual the actual find down in the stream log in on the
[14850.93s -> 14863.46s]  stream why the fuck would I do that make rat movie 3 on stream it's is that
[14863.46s -> 14871.06s]  something that people would actually want me to do and watch the thing is it
[14871.10s -> 14879.39s]  3d movie maker is not like 30 movie it's not like the movies it's a lot more
[14879.39s -> 14884.39s]  like painful frame-by-frame animation than it is about like hey look at this
[14884.39s -> 14894.36s]  funny thing that happens right now but I would actually consider that because the
[14894.36s -> 14901.21s]  plan for rat movie 3 kind of just disappeared when I stopped making
[14901.21s -> 14909.23s]  YouTube videos so maybe I put it on the list it would I would have to be truly
[14909.43s -> 14914.47s]  dedicated to it though because I would need to dedicate real real real time to
[14914.47s -> 14923.95s]  it actual time to it so I don't know I don't know what I want to do with that
[14923.95s -> 14941.88s]  there is no list German we know oh yeah there is no list I've got a notepad right
[14941.88s -> 14947.84s]  here with every single stream thing idea that I got it's on a notepad there's
[14947.84s -> 14952.81s]  like 60 things on it why would I show you that it's a
[14952.81s -> 14957.48s]  spoilers for future streams you're a liar I'm not a liar I don't want to show
[14957.48s -> 14964.51s]  to you I can't show it I'm gonna put it on Google dot you're gonna leak every
[14964.51s -> 14970.74s]  stream idea that I've ever had that's how far I'd know how would I do that I

[16117.93s -> 16120.69s]  you've been a great help over the past few weeks as schools over here in South
[16120.69s -> 16125.81s]  Korea was shut down due to the corona virus with them opening back up in April
[16125.81s -> 16130.41s]  after spring break has been really frustrating being a senior in high
[16130.41s -> 16133.85s]  school makes things kind of important you've odds in the evening and streams
[16133.85s -> 16136.85s]  in the morning have been great for keeping me morale high in times like
[16136.85s -> 16142.01s]  these it's not as bad as a lot of the media report life isn't quite the same
[16142.01s -> 16148.62s]  hopefully that goes back to normal very soon I can imagine how frustrating that
[16148.62s -> 16155.72s]  is even now over here is new cases every day over here and it gets to a point
[16155.72s -> 16159.24s]  where it's like well all right how when how's this gonna play out you know how
[16159.24s -> 16163.68s]  is gonna happen oh I mean we've already started seeing
[16163.72s -> 16170.77s]  conventions and being closed and stuff canceled things being moved so it's
[16170.77s -> 16176.02s]  starting to happen over here too you just really hope that it doesn't get to
[16176.02s -> 16183.51s]  a point where everything has to shut off for an extended period of time so who
[16183.51s -> 16190.44s]  knows just try to stay safe as you can try to take care of yourself and let's
[16190.44s -> 16195.13s]  hope this whole thing kind of lays itself out with the right with the
[16195.13s -> 16201.18s]  proper proper health organization stepping forward and that's getting rid
[16201.18s -> 16212.46s]  of this shit that's all we can really do yeah I heard about the cases in in
[16212.46s -> 16218.74s]  Massachusetts to Vegas just had a one just pop up now to take yesterday the
