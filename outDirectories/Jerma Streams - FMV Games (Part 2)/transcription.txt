[1.08s -> 20.10s]  Hello, welcome. How are you? You doing good? So sorry for the abrupt ending last night.
[21.69s -> 28.62s]  We may get another one. I don't know. It's really kind of up in the air at this point.
[29.69s -> 36.58s]  So around like seven to eight o'clock, maybe earlier Pacific, we might just go,
[38.87s -> 45.45s]  I don't know. We're gonna do what we can. In the meantime, if you're wondering what we're doing
[45.45s -> 56.10s]  tonight, we're continuing the FMV game catalog. There are still plenty to go through. Some of
[56.10s -> 61.62s]  these are extra crusty, and by extra crusty I mean they might just stop working halfway through.
[65.26s -> 72.41s]  Some of these are so crunchy that we might not be able to see past the menu on some of them.
[73.78s -> 81.03s]  I don't know. I've tried to test as many of them as I could, but sometimes you get the
[82.23s -> 88.60s]  cheese stuffed crust. So not only is there crust, there's cheese in there too, which sometimes
[88.60s -> 95.22s]  that's a good thing. But we're gonna start with Ripper. Ripper is a game that has been
[96.18s -> 106.65s]  requested a few times. Christopher Walken is in this game. Am I gonna beat Dragon's Lair 2? I did.
[107.61s -> 114.25s]  I beat Dragon's Lair 2. The final image from last night's stream was me pointing at the screen
[115.64s -> 121.18s]  for about five seconds before the internet turned off. The game telling me, congratulations,
[121.18s -> 128.81s]  you made it to the end, but you failed because you didn't get any treasures. So I did complete it,
[128.81s -> 139.38s]  though. I ain't doing that shit again. And we have that Kingdom game has a sequel. I have that too.
[140.10s -> 155.54s]  I would put your seatbelt on for this one. Here we go. This is Ripper. Why don't we view the intro?
[157.69s -> 168.90s]  We already got a scream face. That's a good start. And you know what? No, fuck it. I'll be
[168.90s -> 172.58s]  right back. I'll be right back. Hold on. Just relax. I'll be right back. Everyone hold on.
[173.54s -> 178.74s]  BRB within four minutes of the stream. Be right back. Just hold on. Wait, no. Just watch this.
[178.74s -> 246.70s]  I'll be right back. Hold on. Fuck it. Hold on. You know how long it took me to get these fucking
[246.70s -> 257.16s]  games to work? I deserve it. I deserve a fresh core is light. Yeah. I don't even I fucking hate
[257.16s -> 272.98s]  beer. All right, here we go. Are you ready for the intro? Oh, all right. You good? We good?
[274.42s -> 287.75s]  You can hear it. Good. The vod's already deleted. Great. That's fantastic. The vod's already gone.
[288.39s -> 294.12s]  No, wait. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to. I'm not having the mod.
[294.12s -> 302.84s]  The mod mod get viewed. I'm not the John Rhys Davies. You know the song.
[303.40s -> 311.72s]  That's all that's happening. That's what's happening right now.
[328.49s -> 332.98s]  I see they can't they can't get me now.
[333.54s -> 361.11s]  All right, the vod is saved. No, I thought that was the end. All right.
[373.22s -> 374.18s]  Content ID can't get it.
[388.30s -> 395.37s]  My editor Ben Dodds called me at 3 a.m. to give me the news. It was a woman this time,
[395.45s -> 400.07s]  the third victim of all the reporters in the city. The ripper picked me to write to fix
[400.07s -> 404.79s]  the screen. Another mad letter to the city was soon to come and I would run it on the
[404.79s -> 411.19s]  front page of the virtual Herald. I would let the world know the ripper had killed again.
[411.19s -> 425.30s]  The Ripper Jack the Ripper. Oh, god damn it. Okay. Yeah, we got it. Oh, wait, that's right.
[425.30s -> 436.38s]  What's wrong with the screen? It's still 400 by 300 screens down because that's when I full
[436.38s -> 441.74s]  screen. Wait, what's it doing? Well, it's fixed because I went out of full screen. What's it
[441.74s -> 452.63s]  doing? Can we give you like an exact explanation of what's happening? It's cropping it. Hold on.
[452.63s -> 460.23s]  Let me see. Can I get a good look? I see what's happening. I see what's happening. Hold on. Okay,
[460.23s -> 469.37s]  hold on a second. I see what's happening here. Hold on. So I gotta move it up. I can look at it.
[469.37s -> 478.87s]  I can see it right now. Look at that. Okay, hold on. I got it. The game may have crashed,
[478.87s -> 488.01s]  but it's okay. This is gonna be this is gonna be close enough. I told you this is gonna be
[488.01s -> 493.86s]  fucking crunchy. Some of you didn't believe me. Like, what do you mean crunchy? What's that even
[493.86s -> 505.94s]  mean? I love like crunchy candy. No, you know, are you sure about that? All right, that's as good as
[505.94s -> 517.94s]  it's gonna get. Let's go. Here we go. Start a new game. That should fix it. We're good. We got it.
[517.94s -> 538.18s]  All right, start new game. Oh, for the love of fucking god. Can I skip this? It's louder this
[538.18s -> 548.46s]  time. What if I click? Hold on. I'm gonna click. No. What about here? It's space. I think I crashed
[548.46s -> 561.30s]  it. No, that's pause. Hold on. Hey, how you doing? I hope you haven't eaten yet, Quinlan. What?
[565.24s -> 569.72s]  Figured you'd get here sooner or later, Quinlan. You can't get enough of this story.
[570.76s -> 578.94s]  I think everyone's had enough of this story, Magnata. Okay, here we go. So there's been a
[578.94s -> 585.50s]  there's been a murder. There's Christopher Walken, right? Yeah, Christopher Walken's in this game.
[586.22s -> 599.27s]  Let's go ahead and go in here. This is a porn game. It is not. There is the man himself.
[600.07s -> 608.41s]  Let's get some dialogue. Don't go taking any souvenirs, Quinlan. Okay, ask about the modus
[608.41s -> 614.10s]  operandi. Ask about the victim. Ask if Magnata has any clues. What's his name? Magnata? Do you
[614.10s -> 619.46s]  have any clues? You have any clues? No sign of Force Sanfri. Nothing's disturbed. Two sets of
[619.46s -> 624.50s]  prints. Hers and a mother's. It's him. The only thing not where it should be is this woman's
[624.50s -> 628.50s]  insights. But what about witnesses? I mean, this guy must have been a bloody mess. Even if it's
[628.50s -> 632.10s]  three o'clock in the morning, it's Greenwich Village. Somebody must have seen him. As far
[632.10s -> 636.74s]  as I know, he left us with one witness and she's feeling a little fragmented at the moment.
[637.38s -> 645.35s]  This guy is unfucking believable. Who's the swears in this game? Wow. Okay, why is the computer
[645.35s -> 649.51s]  still on? Why is her computer on, Magnata? Well, it looks like she was in a public library node.
[650.23s -> 655.59s]  Well, let me ask you a question. You got any mail lately? Maybe a little something from your pen pal?
[656.31s -> 661.35s]  He writes after the fact, not before. You should know that, Magnata. I wouldn't hold out on you.
[661.35s -> 667.27s]  Of course not. Who's my pen pal? About sharing what you know with me and several million other
[667.27s -> 671.67s]  people. I should have busted you when you ran that first letter without letting us know about it.
[674.31s -> 681.35s]  What? Who's the letter? The murderer's letter? The game is a little quiet. I'll take care of that.
[681.35s -> 689.51s]  Just hold on. I'll take care of that. Hold on a second. If I alt tab, the whole thing goes
[689.51s -> 702.44s]  down, I think. Hold on. Hold on. All right, I got it up. Everybody relax. Are we good? I think we're
[702.44s -> 712.98s]  good. Excuse me? Thank you. Okay, what about the victim? Who's the victim? Name's Stein,
[712.98s -> 720.34s]  Rene Stein, age 43, book editor over at Knopf. Any connection to the other two? Oh, let's see.
[720.34s -> 726.18s]  Estevez was a programmer, Mandela a dry cleaner. It'll take me 48 hours to run it down, but there's
[726.18s -> 735.11s]  no connection here. This guy has my hair. All right, what about the modus operandi? No, he doesn't. Same
[735.11s -> 740.31s]  MO as the others? You got it. Look around you, asshole. If anything, this is more gruesome than
[740.31s -> 746.07s]  the other two. Hell of a lot more splatter. Look around you, asshole. All right, visiting
[746.07s -> 750.79s]  hours over. There's nothing here you haven't seen at the other murder sites except a few extra
[750.79s -> 754.23s]  gallons of body fluids. Well, you shouldn't be touching anything, should you, Magnata?
[757.34s -> 764.25s]  Hey. I guess this case has me rattled. Were you drinking out of the coffee cup?
[767.11s -> 773.91s]  Why would you drink out of that coffee cup? What if there's like blood in it? All right, what about
[773.91s -> 780.82s]  in the fridge? No, wait. All right, put it in the computer. Object scanned into database. Uh, that
[780.82s -> 787.03s]  don't look right. That didn't look right at all. That looked a little, a little, a little strange.
[787.59s -> 792.63s]  All right, uh, object has been scanned into the database. That's, uh, anything else I can do.
[793.43s -> 806.68s]  Should I take a look at the blood? Or the computer? Filter. Sharpen. File edit. Images?
[807.96s -> 819.45s]  Deck port interface. Tristec agerware installed. What other? Can I press any buttons? I guess not.
[820.86s -> 829.98s]  Oh, this, what's this guy doing? Oh, he's got a camcorder. I was like, what is this guy doing?
[830.70s -> 834.82s]  But I don't know why I thought that was a microscope. I have no idea. Don't ask me why.
[836.97s -> 852.89s]  Cold Carl Stasiak. We gotta stop eating like this. Carl. Sorry, Quinlan. What'd you say? Uh, any
[852.89s -> 856.81s]  difference between the murder and the previous two? Ask him if any frogs is invaded in the
[856.81s -> 862.15s]  investigation. If he has any idea what weapon, what kind of weapon is the ripper using? Any idea
[862.15s -> 867.83s]  what weapon he's using? Take a look at this mess. Has to be something big. Sword or machete or
[867.83s -> 873.11s]  something. Just can't cut through all that bone and muscle with a dagger. And the strength it
[873.11s -> 879.59s]  would take to make a cut like that. He must be an enormous man. You know, yeah, the pathologist
[879.59s -> 884.39s]  over at the metacock. You know, it's a lot more about murder weapons than I do. You should talk
[884.39s -> 889.83s]  to him and talk to the guy at the, uh, okay. What about the, the, any differences in the murders?
[889.83s -> 894.55s]  Is there any difference between this murder and the previous ones? It's identical. Absolutely
[894.55s -> 901.69s]  identical. It was a precision cut, a perfect line. The way he empties out the body cavity,
[901.69s -> 907.69s]  the way the organs are blown all around the room. So it's the same killer? Oh, for sure. I mean,
[907.69s -> 911.77s]  the organs completely cut the pieces. I never seen anything like this in my life. Just screams
[911.77s -> 919.05s]  wardrobe department. It's amazing. Any clues to how it's done? Don't ask me. You think I'd be used
[919.05s -> 929.26s]  to seeing things like this by now, but I'm not. Whoever did this is beyond madness. It's pure evil.
[929.34s -> 936.79s]  Pure evil. Okay. Any progress? Any other progress? Any progress? All of our mass effect dialogue
[936.79s -> 942.55s]  options. Who knows? Trying to get anything out of Magnata is next to impossible. Besides, if he does
[942.55s -> 948.07s]  have a lead, you sure as hell never share it. You might lose his bounty if he does that. Well, you've
[948.07s -> 951.99s]  been working with Magnata for years, Carl. What's your hunch? There's too many clues. Well, something's
[951.99s -> 957.67s]  bugging him. Who am I to talk? I'm having nightmares about this. The main character's doing a t-shirt
[957.67s -> 964.55s]  challenge. 22 years and nothing's ever got to me like this. Now I can't sleep. No, you just need a
[964.55s -> 970.63s]  vacation. That's all. Yeah. I hope you're right. Incoming whack transmission. Incoming whack
[970.63s -> 979.29s]  transmission. Quinlan here. Hey, Catherine. All right, whatever. Hey, Jake, how are things there?
[980.17s -> 985.85s]  Well, it's very... Oh, this shit is pretty whack. You're right. Just the name, Catherine. Listen,
[985.85s -> 989.85s]  Jake, something's come up here. Something about the ripper? Might be nothing. I don't know. It
[989.85s -> 993.45s]  could be something big. Just wait for me at the newsroom and I'll let you know as soon as I find
[993.45s -> 998.49s]  out. The newsroom? No, talk to me. What's going on? I have to go. Trust me. Who's in charge here?
[998.49s -> 1004.63s]  Well, after last night I say that I am. So all of a sudden you don't have to explain yourself to me?
[1005.35s -> 1008.79s]  Look, if you don't hear from me in an hour, just go to my apartment and wait for me there.
[1009.35s -> 1015.75s]  You can hang out with my crystals. Catherine. My crystals? Shit. Really hang out with your
[1015.75s -> 1031.02s]  crystals. Should I save the game? All right. Save game in this slot. Got it. Save. I will forget
[1031.02s -> 1037.19s]  that now. Fuck it up. All right. So let's go. So we're going to go hang out with the... Is that
[1037.19s -> 1050.18s]  another word for like cats or something? Newsroom. All right. Oh, here we go. What's going on, Ben?
[1050.74s -> 1054.98s]  Did Catherine get a break in the ripper story? I don't know, Jake. I thought you were the lead
[1054.98s -> 1060.02s]  reporter in the story. Well, so did I. Do you know what she's up to? This is chattel. Your assistant.
[1060.02s -> 1065.86s]  You tell me. She ran out of here like the place was on fire. Did another letter from the ripper
[1065.86s -> 1071.72s]  come in? No, you know he doesn't send them to anybody but you. Isn't you... I guess we're just
[1071.72s -> 1078.04s]  going to have to wait and see. Just tell me. Catherine and I met on the job. Despite reminding
[1078.04s -> 1083.32s]  myself that mixing love and work can get messy, it didn't take long for it to become more than a
[1083.32s -> 1087.64s]  professional relationship. I love all the fake stuff. You're not even typing on a real keyboard.
[1087.64s -> 1093.16s]  But she was beginning to act like it was her story. I only hope that whatever lead she had,
[1093.88s -> 1098.92s]  she wasn't in. That's how I type. That's the way I type. See? Incoming WAC transmission.
[1103.29s -> 1110.25s]  Dear boss, have you seen my work this morning yet? Your stories make the cop seem so confident.
[1111.05s -> 1117.45s]  None of you know how I do it. You never will. You shouldn't let your girlfriend do your work for you.
[1118.33s -> 1129.21s]  She is close to me and are not laughing. She's my next job. She gets it today.
[1129.93s -> 1139.37s]  The story's all yours. It was truly written. It's Bugleberry. Catherine. What was he looking at?
[1139.37s -> 1144.84s]  Where are you going? That was a cigarette holder. Usually it takes an hour to cross that part of
[1144.84s -> 1149.96s]  Manhattan. I did it in 20 minutes, propelled by kicking myself in the ass for letting Catherine
[1149.96s -> 1155.40s]  go out alone. I was scared as hell when I got there, but everything looked okay in her apartment
[1156.52s -> 1162.12s]  until Catherine showed up, that is. Catherine, what is going on here? This is her apartment?
[1162.12s -> 1169.08s]  Where is this? What's with this Dracula apartment? What is wrong? What happened? She's been stabbed.
[1170.04s -> 1176.04s]  What? No, no, no, Catherine. Catherine, no. Catherine, no. Catherine, please, Catherine.
[1176.84s -> 1187.19s]  Fuck! What? Hold on, wait, why is this so, why did we get another one? Good news was Catherine wasn't
[1187.19s -> 1193.00s]  dead. The bad news was that she was in a coma deeper than anyone thought possible. What happened?
[1193.00s -> 1197.96s]  The ever-helpful Detective Magnata had her brought to the Tribeca Center for Cyber Studies,
[1197.96s -> 1203.16s]  also known as the MEDICOG. Meanwhile, I stopped off at the police station to see a few sources
[1203.16s -> 1207.72s]  and try to retrieve Catherine's portable whack. She'll have left me a message.
[1212.47s -> 1216.87s]  All right, so we're gonna, she's in a coma. Yeah, but why, why did she go into a coma?
[1217.91s -> 1229.80s]  All right, we're looking for the portable whack device. Looks like we're gonna talk to this guy.
[1236.23s -> 1244.49s]  Finish this game or riot? Um, we'll see. We'll see, because once we get to like the second or
[1244.49s -> 1258.44s]  third disc change I have to do, good luck. I've got him. That shit's gonna work. Who's that?
[1260.30s -> 1267.19s]  Hey, Quinlan. The Ripper Strikes Again. I guess we'll be seeing your work on the front page again.
[1267.19s -> 1271.27s]  Another body and another byline. You know, if you just catch this- This guy also has other things.
[1271.27s -> 1276.68s]  I could go back to writing the police plotter on page 12. Sorry to hear about your partner.
[1276.68s -> 1282.04s]  What is that? She was a nice girl. I liked her when she came around here. She used to come down here?
[1282.84s -> 1287.85s]  Came down here all the time. She used to do your leg work. Right, right. I just-
[1289.13s -> 1295.37s]  Was it the same guy? I can't do everything, can I? All right, any clues? I need,
[1296.17s -> 1304.06s]  I need the whack device. What about Magnata? I'll tell you, Lou, Magnata wasn't all two together
[1304.06s -> 1310.62s]  at the murder site. It's lucky for you. No, I'm serious. There was this one strange thing.
[1311.50s -> 1317.98s]  Strange? Yeah, I mean, if I didn't know any better, I'd say that he intentionally
[1317.98s -> 1324.22s]  destroyed a piece of evidence. It won't be the first time. What? Well, he's done it before.
[1324.78s -> 1330.30s]  Yeah, he hides it, he destroys it, he withholds it, you name it. And this is common knowledge.
[1330.30s -> 1334.30s]  Yeah, he's like king shit at a bounty collecting and the chief gets a piece of it.
[1334.86s -> 1342.49s]  I mean, what are you gonna do? You know how this place works. Really? Okay. I think it's time
[1342.49s -> 1349.34s]  to clean up the department. Any, any clues from the library? What about the library?
[1349.34s -> 1355.74s]  That was the last place that I was seen alive. Standard operating procedures to copy all libraries.
[1356.94s -> 1363.80s]  C-space files, that kind of stuff. Well, how can I get my hands on what they found?
[1364.98s -> 1370.50s]  Hell, Quinlan, it's a public library. We just copied the files. Everything's still there. What?
[1370.50s -> 1377.98s]  What? Okay, we gotta go to the library. Forensics come up with anything yet?
[1379.02s -> 1383.90s]  Apparently, this pathologist over at the, the metacog, he's come up with this theory.
[1384.54s -> 1388.70s]  He thinks that the Ripper may have been using nanomachines to do it.
[1389.50s -> 1395.90s]  No, God. Not nanomachines. Yeah. Not nanomachines.
[1397.34s -> 1402.18s]  I think it's time I bribe a photographer. Where's Stasiak?
[1403.19s -> 1407.59s]  He's in Wyoming. Oh, come on, Brandon. He's the only guy I haven't really talked to.
[1407.59s -> 1411.27s]  You never know what he might have picked up on. Yeah, well, that's the problem. He picked up on
[1411.27s -> 1416.31s]  too much. I'm not kidding. He went to Wyoming. The case was too much for him, and he took a
[1416.31s -> 1423.19s]  leave of absence. Okay. Stasiak, cold Carl Stasiak. Yeah, get this. After the Stein murder, his wife
[1423.19s -> 1429.67s]  calls and says Carl needed a little vacation. Carl? No, that was it. He just got up, no goodbyes,
[1429.67s -> 1446.63s]  no nothing. He didn't even give me a call. Thanks for the info. Let's go. It's always weird when
[1446.63s -> 1455.19s]  they put the CG, and I use that term very loosely here, but when you're an actor in a world that is
[1455.19s -> 1461.67s]  created in 3D with old 3D technology, just it's so, it's weird. It's scary. Like this shit's creepy.
[1462.39s -> 1469.21s]  That old style of 3D mapping with the actors and shit. It's, it's fucking bizarre.
[1470.09s -> 1485.99s]  What's over here? Yeah, it's a, it's a mist. Detective Vincent, there it is. Okay, Magnato.
[1487.43s -> 1493.51s]  Why do we have offices like this? Where are we? What year is it supposed to be?
[1497.94s -> 1506.89s]  I don't, I don't get it. It's 2040. It said the year. Well, that's too busy fucking muting VODs.
[1506.89s -> 1518.17s]  Fucking hey, cigars. The man's got taste. I'll give him that. Can I take one? Anything else down
[1518.17s -> 1527.59s]  here? Oh, hold on. I can open it by my, my whack device. Object scanned into database.
[1529.27s -> 1537.99s]  What is it? Uh, arrest report. I can't read this. Violation of city penal code detective,
[1537.99s -> 1544.07s]  arresting officer detective Vincent Magnato. Corpus observed at 1 45 a.m. at the corner of
[1544.07s -> 1551.82s]  Washington. It was a discharging submitter, but I had a taser to disable two members of this
[1551.82s -> 1561.10s]  spreading zugs. A rage gang captain from 40 feet with a sleeper bullet and called for a cleanup.
[1562.30s -> 1572.92s]  All right. Well, I got it scanned, so let's see if it's bullshit. Can I go on his computer? I don't
[1572.92s -> 1579.99s]  think so. Let's get out of here. It's going to be standing right there, sitting on the couch.
[1580.87s -> 1604.63s]  Give me the fuck out of this. Wasn't I supposed to find her whack device? Can I go? Can I go
[1604.63s -> 1618.90s]  anywhere else? Wait, what about this way? What is down there? Over there? Please stop the bongos.
[1618.90s -> 1630.17s]  I can't. They can't be stopped. Go over here. I'm just spinning around. Uh, I want to go in this room.
[1631.05s -> 1635.75s]  Is this the evidence chamber? Fucking stop them. I can't stop them.
[1636.47s -> 1640.95s]  There I cannot deter. I can't turn the bongos off evidence room. Here we are.
[1645.21s -> 1652.50s]  Welcome to the evidence chamber. What can I help you with, buddy? Oh crap. What do you want?
[1652.50s -> 1656.34s]  Some respect, Spankowski. You know, you really shouldn't talk to me like that.
[1656.34s -> 1661.30s]  I shouldn't be talking to you at all, you goddamn leech. What do you want? Some of us got to work
[1661.30s -> 1668.55s]  for a living. Right. I want to see evidence from the Catherine Powell case, please. I need the
[1668.55s -> 1674.82s]  evidence in the Powell case. No way, Quinlan. That could be my job. All right, time to convince.
[1675.54s -> 1680.65s]  Bluff them. Tell them Magnata said it's all right to see the evidence. Let's go with the bluff.
[1680.65s -> 1684.33s]  Let's see, can I get him with my... do I have enough charisma to do this? I need the evidence
[1684.33s -> 1689.45s]  in the Powell case. Spankowski, what are you worried about? Magnata okayed it. Get the hell
[1689.45s -> 1693.37s]  out of here, Quinlan. Magnata would never let a civilian see evidence. He doesn't even like it
[1693.37s -> 1704.15s]  when they're in the building. Uh oh. Didn't work. Didn't work. Not good. Look, Quinlan. I told you
[1704.15s -> 1706.71s]  everything I know. Now will you get the hell out of here before you get me in trouble?
[1709.11s -> 1713.27s]  Look, Quinlan. I told you everything I know. Now will you get the hell out of here before you get
[1713.27s -> 1720.76s]  me in trouble? I still don't understand the thing around that necks. I obviously need to
[1720.76s -> 1730.94s]  find a way to convince him to give me the evidence. Let's go. Let's go. That's a police badge.
[1732.54s -> 1749.88s]  All right, let's see if I... did I unlock any new areas? What about that way? Turn the music off?
[1750.44s -> 1757.59s]  No, I'm not going to turn the music off. You'll be fine. There we go. Police station. Try pick a
[1757.59s -> 1766.07s]  center. All right. Catherine Powell's apartment newsroom. Let's go to... uh, I was supposed to
[1766.07s -> 1771.34s]  meet somebody at the newsroom, right? Let's go. Oh, shit!
[1788.41s -> 1801.38s]  Well, it looks like we're never going to go to... we're never going to go to the newsroom.
[1808.15s -> 1814.87s]  Metacog, uh-huh, hold on. Metacog, uh-huh, hold on. Metacog, hold on. Metacog, hold on.
[1814.87s -> 1819.43s]  I, like, brought all the footage. Oh, the... Did you pardon? I thought it was going to work.
[1819.43s -> 1826.17s]  I said, can I help you? What'd you think I said? Nothing. I... I'm looking for, uh,
[1826.17s -> 1830.41s]  whoever's taking care of my girlfriend, Catherine Powell. That would be Dr. Burton.
[1830.41s -> 1834.97s]  Take the elevator to the second floor and make a right. If she's not there, go to ICU down the
[1834.97s -> 1841.21s]  hall from there. Whatever you do, don't stand too close to her. Why's that? A little chilly.
[1842.18s -> 1859.30s]  What? Right. All right, let's just go up here. Elevator and to the right. That's a scary looking
[1859.30s -> 1884.46s]  place. Is this a scary game? It might be. That's... I don't know. It could be. I gotta go up.
[1885.34s -> 1899.08s]  Ward's Lobby Morgue. Let's go to the... Ward? What is going on? Oh, yeah.
[1902.28s -> 1908.89s]  Uh, that scared the shit out of me. That actually did. I thought it was, like, a scream.
[1910.81s -> 1929.82s]  And then to the right. Is this supposed to be scary? I don't know. I can't tell.
[1930.70s -> 1937.37s]  This might be a part where it's going to be scary. There's nothing even over there.
[1944.60s -> 1952.94s]  Oh, there she is. All right, so... What are you doing here? My name's Jay Quinlan. I'm a friend
[1952.94s -> 1961.19s]  of Catherine's. Quinlan? Yeah, okay. How is Catherine? Is she going to be all right?
[1961.19s -> 1966.79s]  It doesn't look good. Her consciousness is deeply withdrawn. Where is she withdrawn? What's that
[1966.79s -> 1973.19s]  mean? It means her mental processes, her memory, the basic building blocks of her personality are
[1973.19s -> 1978.95s]  inaccessible. You mean she's in there, but you can't reach her? That's a best case scenario.
[1978.95s -> 1994.78s]  We haven't yet diagnosed her psychic damage. How did the Ripper do this? It's hard to tell.
[1995.58s -> 2000.30s]  She had some minor contusions on her head. Nothing fatal, but you never know with head injuries.
[2000.30s -> 2004.54s]  We won't know anything until we can get a data angel in there to do some... A data angel? You
[2004.54s -> 2009.34s]  can get a data angel into the consciousness of someone in a coma? I'm not sending anyone in there
[2009.34s -> 2014.70s]  until I've had a chance to fully map her psychic damage. Let me get in there. Now, if you don't mind.
[2016.14s -> 2025.37s]  All right, well what are you doing for her? What are you doing for her? I'm not doing anything for
[2025.37s -> 2029.61s]  her as long as I'm standing here talking to you. Why don't you let me get back to work?
[2030.81s -> 2037.11s]  So I have to go in there on my own then? Will, is she going to be all right? It doesn't look good.
[2037.75s -> 2046.20s]  She's still in triage. We're going to just have to wait and see. Well, what do you do? Let me get in
[2046.20s -> 2052.36s]  there. Let me, can I at least see? Wait, there's another person here. You here to check on Miss
[2052.36s -> 2057.88s]  Powell? Miss Paul Giamani. She looks pretty bad. Is there anything you can do for her? She's in good
[2057.88s -> 2064.74s]  hands, and she'll be in even better hands once Dr. Burton allows us to treat her. Where's Dr.
[2064.74s -> 2083.30s]  Burtman? Let me in there. Is something I'm going to take? Is there anything else I can do in here?
[2086.58s -> 2094.86s]  I don't think I can do anything else in this room. No, all right, that doctor. I've got to go to the
[2094.86s -> 2104.14s]  doctor. Let's find the doctor's office. Insert disk two. I will. I'll try. I have to save the game. I'm
[2104.14s -> 2116.46s]  going to restart the game. Guys, I'm running this game through like four different virtual layers,
[2116.46s -> 2124.07s]  okay? I'm on my computer, and then from my computer to a virtual machine, from the virtual
[2124.07s -> 2133.18s]  machine to a DOS emulation, from an emulation through the disk. Sorry, I just bumped you.
[2138.44s -> 2151.40s]  And then through VPN. What is going on over here? Jump scare, jump scare, jump scare, jump scare. Do
[2151.40s -> 2164.50s]  it. Oh, it's a wet floor. I can't go over here. No, that's what these are here for. I can't go
[2164.50s -> 2176.81s]  this way. Wait. Locked. Damn. How am I supposed to open this? I don't know. Do you have like a,
[2177.37s -> 2192.34s]  what the fuck do you have? Remote control. I can turn the game down from in my inventory. Okay.
[2194.47s -> 2201.14s]  I don't want to press the power button. Oh, here we go. Cool. All right. How do I, I don't want to,
[2201.14s -> 2205.48s]  I don't want to, how do I turn? No, no, don't reset the game. Just turn this off.
[2207.18s -> 2220.92s]  Okay. Inventory. Use. Done. All right. Save game. Right here. Overwrite. Save it. Okay.
[2221.96s -> 2239.67s]  I'm gonna turn around. There's nothing else over here. The game, this game low key sucks.
[2245.26s -> 2258.15s]  Just wait a second. We need to go to the other place. This game's low key sucks. We're gonna
[2258.15s -> 2272.76s]  go to the morgue. I'm gonna try the other disc, but not yet. We don't have to do that yet.
[2279.96s -> 2289.93s]  There we are. All right. There's combat in this game. Guys, don't you want to at least see the
[2289.93s -> 2296.81s]  combat? Don't you want to see Kristen walking and go, well, at least one more time before we end this?
[2297.77s -> 2307.00s]  Don't you want to see that? Don't you want to know? I kind of need to know. I have to beat this game.
[2311.30s -> 2316.20s]  There's combat. What is going on? Is it just a pair of legs? What the fuck is that?
[2316.92s -> 2326.92s]  Is it Paul Giamatti again? Hey, Vic. What's for lunch? Hey, Quinlan. Oh, what the?
[2328.76s -> 2335.18s]  They work in your heart? Workin' me like crazy these days. Hey, is this Renee Stein?
[2335.82s -> 2341.90s]  You're kidding. You were at the crime scene. I saw her inside splattered everywhere. Yeah,
[2341.90s -> 2350.42s]  I guess I did. Yeah, this one was married to her, Ripper. Yeah, this was a businessman. We're on a
[2350.42s -> 2353.46s]  trip for three weeks. He gets paranoid that his partner's puttin' her in a car. Can you take the
[2353.46s -> 2356.82s]  cigarette out of your mouth before you talk to me, please? So he flies home early and shoots it at
[2356.82s -> 2375.37s]  that. I mean, stuff like that. That's why I never got married, you know? Low key TOS. Any luck
[2375.37s -> 2379.05s]  figuring out the Ripper's weapon yet? What's the weapon? I'm completely stumped. Nano machine.
[2379.05s -> 2383.69s]  I did every test on these STIPS. I mean, a computer cross-matched the wounds with every
[2383.69s -> 2389.13s]  kind of blade imaginable. Nothin'. I mean, it's like a cross between a Vegematic and a diamond cutter.
[2389.13s -> 2391.61s]  What's with the thing on his head? Something must have cut these people open.
[2391.61s -> 2394.33s]  Nothing these computers can find. What's with the miner's helmet on? Now, you don't believe me?
[2394.33s -> 2401.14s]  Look at those control panels by the STIPS. Doctors don't have those. What is that? He's got blood in
[2401.14s -> 2407.46s]  his hands and he's, like, putting it on his mouth. You hear about my partner? Who's that? Catherine
[2407.46s -> 2413.06s]  Powell. She was attacked by the Ripper. Somehow she got away. She's upstairs in a coma. Dr. Burton's
[2413.06s -> 2416.50s]  treating her. Oh. Oh, that's supposed to be the future. Right. Okay. Burton's a good doctor.
[2417.38s -> 2423.29s]  And if she gets stuck, she'll probably call in her secret weapon. What's that? A guy named
[2423.29s -> 2432.14s]  Joey Falconetti. Joey Falconetti. Joey Falconetti. Okay. Who's that? Who's Joey Falconetti?
[2432.14s -> 2437.50s]  Cyberspace expert that Burton uses on all the tough cases. Also known by his old C-space handle,
[2437.50s -> 2443.18s]  Falconetti. Get it? Crazy guy. Likes looking at the body. I'm surprised she hasn't called him in
[2443.18s -> 2448.70s]  yet to look at your friend. What do you mean? Oh, well, he keeps doing it. Stop doing that.
[2448.70s -> 2452.54s]  She usually calls him in on that kind of stuff. All right. Now, it would have been funny if they
[2452.54s -> 2457.82s]  had a take where he went and he put it up into his mouth and went like, and then just kept talking.
[2458.78s -> 2466.78s]  Where can I find this Falconetti? Difficult guy to find. Burton usually goes to a guy named Gamet
[2466.78s -> 2474.06s]  Nelson. He passes the time at the Café du Champ. Café du Champ. Okay. Du Champ. You can find him
[2474.06s -> 2482.25s]  there. All right. Let's see what disk that requires. We've got new locations. Let's see if I can like
[2482.25s -> 2490.39s]  boot the second disk and like load from there. If not, then well. I tapped the nerve memory of this
[2490.39s -> 2496.07s]  victim and fed it into the simulator so that I could reenact the attack. Million dollar piece
[2496.07s -> 2502.92s]  of hardware. And look what it gives me. Jesus. Looks like she swallowed a fucking grenade.
[2504.82s -> 2510.41s]  I, who's, who's mind are we looking at? Here's an isolation of just one of the organs from this
[2510.41s -> 2516.62s]  body. The lines indicate the many cuts made for this body. The sheer number of cuts isn't the
[2516.62s -> 2524.54s]  only amazing thing. Now watch this. All of those cuts happen simultaneously. Human hands can't move
[2525.18s -> 2528.62s]  so the river is like this for every four years. He's got like powers or something.
[2529.18s -> 2535.54s]  He's got technological powers. Notice the path of the cut. Not one centimeter offline. Like a seam
[2535.54s -> 2541.06s]  was unknown. Not the second disk. Because humans aren't strong enough. Does that work? Does that
[2541.06s -> 2547.70s]  can work? Will that work? No way this cut could be so neat. I'll tell you what else is weird.
[2547.70s -> 2556.14s]  There are no traces of fabric in the world. Oh, we're good. First layer. Peel back the
[2556.22s -> 2562.62s]  fucking onion skin. Second layer. That's where we are. That you are here. That's where the
[2562.62s -> 2568.65s]  DOS is being implemented into the virtual machine. Layer three is mounting the disk.
[2568.65s -> 2579.42s]  The disk is layer fucking four. I'm gonna try it. Did he lose disk two? Yeah, what you guys
[2579.42s -> 2583.34s]  don't understand is I, you know, I, I, I bought this game and it only came for the first disk.
[2583.98s -> 2587.45s]  I got scammed. I'm just, you know, I'm gonna be real with you.
[2588.01s -> 2600.60s]  Yeah. Nice Shrek metaphor. What the fuck is a Shrek metaphor mean?
[2601.72s -> 2608.70s]  All right. I'm going to try it. I gotta, I got my pathing correct.
[2610.54s -> 2620.31s]  The onions. Does he do an onion thing? I like an onion. Donkey. I like an onion.
[2621.43s -> 2626.87s]  Got this layer. Oh, he does do that. You're right. Fuck. Whatever. All right. So when I
[2626.87s -> 2633.51s]  ask for the disk, we mount the second disk and then we press enter and then I press okay.
[2634.15s -> 2645.26s]  Oh, it's going to be fucking amazing. Okay. Newsroom. Okay. Hold on here.
[2647.35s -> 2670.28s]  Let's get this correct. So newsroom. Insert disk two into drive D. I can't get back out there,
[2670.28s -> 2698.22s]  though. I can't get it. Eject it. Eject. Oh God. Hurry. Do that in this menu. Hold on. Wait,
[2698.22s -> 2704.18s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I gotta get a bigger screen here. Hold on. I'm
[2704.18s -> 2713.61s]  gonna stay here. Quick eject it. This is where we're going to, this is how I can tell if this
[2713.61s -> 2728.25s]  is going to work. Okay. Everybody relax. Don't, nobody move. Don't fucking move. Okay. Nobody
[2728.25s -> 2778.55s]  move. Don't move. Action. Okay. Here we go. Everybody relax. Where is it? Shit. Hold on.
[2778.55s -> 2840.74s]  All right. Come in. Fuck. I should have got an expert to help me. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,
[2840.74s -> 2847.22s]  we're coming back. Here we go. Bingo. You didn't think I fucking had it in me, did you?
[2847.78s -> 2854.60s]  You didn't think I fucking had it in me. We're on disk two. You didn't think I had it in me.
[2855.48s -> 2896.49s]  Move restore game or continue game? No. It's okay. It's okay. We're gonna.
[2900.92s -> 2913.83s]  Shit. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. When mounting multiple images, you still have a
[2913.83s -> 2917.03s]  good disk control. You can then switch between the amount of disk control and the amount of disk control
[2917.03s -> 2927.03s]  before. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second, guys. Guys. Mounting multiple images. Let's do it.
[2927.35s -> 2936.65s]  Let's go. That's not an Alt F4 joke. It's not. All right. Mounting multiple. How do I mount?
[2937.53s -> 2946.17s]  I need a DOS cool person to save me right now. This game has seven disks. It's got to be mounted
[2946.17s -> 2957.11s]  in the same drive. It is. We're good. How do I mount multiple? It's mount extra. It's on DOS box.
[2965.02s -> 2989.14s]  You can't. I can't. No. Delete C Windows System 32. I use Daemon tools. We'll go back to that
[2989.14s -> 3004.36s]  when I get a DOS person. It's okay because we're moving on. We're moving on to this one. Do a full
[3004.36s -> 3019.03s]  stream on Ripper. I'm gonna go back to Ripper. Let's open it up. We're gonna go from there.
[3019.03s -> 3031.22s]  We're gonna go on to Kingdom 2. Wait, somebody's got it. Is that correct? Like, is that correct?
[3031.86s -> 3037.59s]  Sawdust bunnies. Is that correct? Is that the correct way that I do this? Just mount them all
[3037.59s -> 3043.38s]  in the same place. Just mount them all. Just mount them all. Just type them. Just mount them all.
[3047.80s -> 3054.52s]  Just list them all in one command. And then it's Ctrl F4, right? Hold on. Stay right there.
[3055.08s -> 3076.94s]  I'm gonna try that. Don't accidentally press Alt F4. I tried to do this before, too. This is
[3076.94s -> 3084.25s]  not gonna end well. I have to move on. Just install Windows. I tried to run this through
[3084.25s -> 3095.94s]  Virtual Machine and I couldn't get it to work. All right. I gotta move on. I have to. This is
[3095.94s -> 3108.60s]  gonna take too long. I'm gonna try this one time and we'll see what happens. I gotta get this on
[3108.60s -> 3112.76s]  screen so people can tell me if I'm doing it right. This is the one time I'm gonna try this.
[3115.64s -> 3127.58s]  Tell me. This is a troubleshooting stream. You ready? So, all of the disks are in this folder
[3127.58s -> 3136.31s]  called FMV. Welcome to the stream. Hey, everybody. How are you? Okay. So, that's the drive that it's
[3136.31s -> 3147.51s]  in. Okay. They're all in there. RIP 1, RIP 2, RIP 3, RIP 4, RIP 5. I already screwed it up. It's
[3147.51s -> 3169.56s]  image mount. All right. So, that's that. That's that, right? I'm hacking with two fingers. I am.
[3169.56s -> 3177.77s]  You're right. I absolutely am. Okay. Is this correct? Somebody has an image of this. Somebody
[3177.85s -> 3187.03s]  has an image of this. Let me see. This is not gonna do anything.
[3191.06s -> 3200.34s]  This is not an image. Why did you link this? I need help. I need fucking help. I need not this.
[3200.34s -> 3217.69s]  I need help. All right. Somebody help me. If I do this for all of them and then I do dash t
[3218.33s -> 3227.80s]  dash iso. Is this gonna work? No. Stop laughing. Stop laughing. Everybody, I need people to stop
[3227.80s -> 3236.22s]  laughing. I need help. I'm gonna do it. So, is this correct? Just end it. Okay. Hold on.
[3244.94s -> 3263.29s]  Okay. Then there's four. Everyone stop laughing. I can't see the chat. Stop laughing. Stop laughing
[3263.29s -> 3281.58s]  at me. Okay. Here we go. And there's enough. There's six fucking disks. God damn it. I even
[3281.58s -> 3289.88s]  was gonna buy like an old Macintosh computer on eBay. But the description said that the screen
[3289.88s -> 3293.24s]  was broken and that I needed to bring it to a repair shop. It was gonna be like 1200 bucks.
[3293.88s -> 3315.13s]  So, I didn't do it. Okay. Here we go. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, is this gonna work? Will that do
[3315.13s -> 3320.47s]  it? And then I need to I need a computer programmer in the chat to tell me that's gonna work. Do you
[3320.47s -> 3335.26s]  have computer programming skills? No. That's not gonna work. I'm an IT major. It won't work. Look
[3335.26s -> 3338.86s]  at this link. Look at this link. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop. Stop laughing. Stop
[3338.86s -> 3348.65s]  writing text. It's possible to mount more than one image in a page. Imagesmount.com. Why is it
[3348.65s -> 3378.79s]  .com? .com? Why does it say Imagesmount.com? Like that. You put an extra. I'm a DOS major and I
[3378.79s -> 3385.67s]  guarantee it'll absolutely work. Trust me. Open the link. There's a typo. No, there's not. There's
[3385.67s -> 3396.25s]  no typo. There's an extra rip where. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Is it Imagesmount.com?
[3401.14s -> 3419.14s]  Oh, God damn it. Imagesmount.com. All right. Imagesmount.com. It is. I did it right. I did
[3419.14s -> 3424.90s]  it right the first time. I need a computer analyst to explain this to me. Imagesmount.com. D. E.
[3426.97s -> 3440.34s]  to the tutorial for you. And people are writing so much. That code will. That code is going to
[3440.34s -> 3450.47s]  break your computer. No. All right. So hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So I need someone
[3450.47s -> 3454.23s]  to tell me. I won't. I'm going to put it on emote only mode and then I'm going to pull.
[3458.87s -> 3468.74s]  If I. Okay. Now if I continue to do this, will it work? Did I have it right the first time?
[3468.74s -> 3478.70s]  I had it right the first time. Read the guide. Just look at doc box wiki. It's not .com.
[3479.58s -> 3493.30s]  So I had it right the first time. More than one image. Yes, I know. Okay. So yeah. D. Remember
[3493.30s -> 3500.26s]  E is my, what I have as my C drive. Right. So I just have to do everything that I did normally.
[3500.26s -> 3515.42s]  So Imagesmount. D. All the stuff. And then dash T. CDROM. Is that correct? That's correct? Oh,
[3515.42s -> 3536.07s]  let's go. Let's go. Let's go. How do you say let's go when you're doing shell command?
[3537.26s -> 3544.38s]  I don't understand how you. This is why you give programming to our
[3546.14s -> 3573.59s]  FMV slash rip one dot ISO. Then the next one. Right. Dude, let's go. I'm so stupid. Okay. Check
[3573.59s -> 3597.38s]  my work while I go, please. Okay. What's going on here? Why does this look so fucked up? What
[3597.38s -> 3599.06s]  happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What
[3599.06s -> 3601.14s]  happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What
[3601.14s -> 3619.64s]  happened? What happened? Why did it do that? I can't go back. What? I can only do one line?
[3623.56s -> 3637.11s]  No, it was, it was a different line. No, I have to go. I have to hold on. Oh,
[3640.39s -> 3655.24s]  everybody stop talking. Thank you. Appreciate it. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[3679.30s -> 3688.30s]  They can't. This is the programming humor subreddit where it's like, whoops, I get to
[3688.38s -> 3698.66s]  slash instead of a dash. I can't imagine this is why they get paid the big bucks.
[3698.66s -> 3712.82s]  D E. Okay. That's correct. I'm going to do this as we go. E rip to ISO space E FMV rip three
[3712.82s -> 3728.50s]  dot IS. Don't get it wrong. Okay. That's all correct. E FMV rip four dot ISO. Okay. That's
[3728.50s -> 3752.73s]  correct. So far space E FMV rip five dot ISO done space E slash FMV rip six dot ISO done dash
[3752.73s -> 3766.26s]  T ISO. Is this correct? Do I press enter? This will do it. This is going to work. I'm seeing a
[3766.26s -> 3785.88s]  lot of yeses. I'm seeing a lot of yeses. A lot of them. It worked. Did it work? Did it work? Did
[3785.88s -> 3796.54s]  it work? Is that it? Do I not touch anything? Did it work? I think it worked. Okay. Now we go.
[3797.34s -> 3852.70s]  We got it. Here we go. Don't touch anything. Okay. What happened? What happened? What happened?
[3852.70s -> 3876.71s]  Get this fucking thing off the screen. What do I do? Control F4, right? That puts me in another
[3876.71s -> 3903.93s]  disk. I have to be on disk one. Okay. Disk two of six is now active. Hold on. Fuck did I do?
[3903.93s -> 3913.74s]  I need disk one. Control F4. Disk three is now active. Disk four is now active.
[3913.74s -> 3926.68s]  Disk five. Disk six. Disk one is now active. Disk one is in. It's in there.
[3945.99s -> 3957.70s]  It works. But does it work? Combat medium. It worked. Everybody chill the fuck out.
[3957.70s -> 3967.35s]  Everybody's everybody. Wait, wait. Hold on. I think I got it. I think I got it. We're moving
[3967.35s -> 3975.64s]  around. This is disk one. This is important. Because if I can change the disk to and press
[3975.64s -> 3984.09s]  okay, then holy fuck. I am a goddamn genius. I just need to check to make sure this is going
[3984.09s -> 3991.06s]  to work. Oh yeah. Right. This has got to get off the screen. You're right. Okay. Here we go.
[3992.33s -> 3998.87s]  Newsroom. Insert disk two into the drive. Control F4. You're on disk two now.
[3998.87s -> 4039.08s]  I'm gonna relish in this one. I am gonna relish in this shit. You better believe it.
[4039.80s -> 4051.78s]  You didn't think I was smart enough to handle this. Nobody did. But I am. You didn't think I
[4051.78s -> 4059.88s]  was fucking smart enough to handle it. Oh, but you were wrong. You were all wrong. I knew about
[4059.88s -> 4065.90s]  the mounting. I knew about the images. I knew about the onion. Although it's hard to recalibrate
[4065.90s -> 4072.22s]  this. That's all right. It looks good. Let's go. I'm fucking on. I'm absolutely on cloud nine right
[4072.22s -> 4079.70s]  now. I'm like so happy. I did that under pressure too. That was a fucking end zone pass that I just
[4079.70s -> 4099.86s]  I it was an end zone pass. Can you guys see? How did I gain viewers doing that? That's I don't
[4099.86s -> 4119.50s]  know how that's possible. I'm supposed to meet somebody here, right? They expected a cool
[4119.58s -> 4135.16s]  programming stream. All right. Somebody in there. There's a brain. I think I think our
[4135.16s -> 4143.90s]  whack the machine is still going to be broken though. A computer with a deck port can never
[4143.90s -> 4168.14s]  have too many of those. Okay. Should I go in? Exit cyberspace. Why is this supposed to be
[4168.14s -> 4182.78s]  virtual reality? Berman incorporated. Virtual library. Virtual library. Sure. Let's open it up.
[4183.66s -> 4200.66s]  I hope it asks me to change this because I'm ready for it. Who's this? I can't see with it.
[4202.18s -> 4208.54s]  I know with some call numbers on it. Am I underwater? Could Renee Stein have left this here?
[4209.26s -> 4217.48s]  I could use some help here. You're a human presence I assume. Everyone at a service desk is. The
[4217.48s -> 4227.93s]  library doesn't use smart sprites for public interface. You don't read much do you? This
[4227.93s -> 4234.26s]  sucks. Go back to DOS box coding. Ask if she's seen Renee Stein. Did you see a woman named Renee
[4234.26s -> 4239.70s]  Stein recently? Records place her here but she didn't check anything out and I don't remember
[4239.70s -> 4247.42s]  seeing her. Okay what about the call number? Can you help me with this call number? I'm sorry this
[4247.42s -> 4253.50s]  is not a valid call number. It appears Stein altered the reference matrix but an unknown book
[4253.50s -> 4257.90s]  was distributed. If you could unscramble the call number I could help you.
[4257.90s -> 4264.52s]  Unscramble the call number. Prior period distribution list. Physical deletion
[4264.52s -> 4290.95s]  uncompleted. Okay address call number. Who am I doing this for? What? That's all I know.
[4290.95s -> 4309.80s]  Just tell me what it is. Just tell me what it is.
[4321.14s -> 4327.70s]  HC. I don't care. HC4. No is this correct? No I'm not writing that unless I know it's for real.
[4327.78s -> 4338.65s]  I don't know. I don't know if that. I'm not writing that. I don't know what that is. Can I get a mod
[4338.65s -> 4352.78s]  to look it up? I can look it up. The HC is on my screen. Alright so what was it? I thought you
[4352.78s -> 4364.06s]  guys were writing like he shit whatever. Like he wrote a thing he didn't think of as he was writing
[4364.78s -> 4397.74s]  but he did. Like he shit. HC what was it? 45. Say it again. Tell me what the code is. 73T.
[4399.50s -> 4415.34s]  I think the game crashed. You should really look into this Quinlan. It could mean something.
[4416.38s -> 4424.79s]  Did I get it? Can you help me with this call number? I'm sorry this is not a valid call number.
[4425.35s -> 4431.03s]  It appears Stein altered the reference matrix but an unknown book was distributed. If you
[4431.03s -> 4443.13s]  could unscramble the call number I could help you. What is it? HC is the actual number. HC.
[4445.42s -> 4458.49s]  No. Two. I looked it up. The four numbers are contained in the square brackets.
[4459.61s -> 4462.81s]  Didn't know how to figure it out. You need to make sense of the algebra. You can read the code like
[4462.81s -> 4473.83s]  this. So this one was it? What's the last one? Wait Quinlan that's a valid call number. I'll get
[4473.83s -> 4478.71s]  the book. People didn't think I was capable of doing it but I just continue to prove them wrong.
[4480.47s -> 4485.02s]  A book about the original Jack the Ripper. Can't be a coincidence.
[4485.66s -> 4491.26s]  Renee Stein must have used this but what does it mean? You read chat. I didn't read chat.
[4492.60s -> 4497.88s]  You talk to them. Have the cops talked to you? They asked questions but I couldn't tell them much.
[4497.88s -> 4502.28s]  They copied all the files from the Victorian route directory and ordered us not to alter the
[4502.28s -> 4506.52s]  file structures until the case is solved. I've been streaming for like six hours. The day Stein
[4506.52s -> 4514.84s]  was killed would still be here. Guess so. I sure didn't take them. All right well I got some new info.
[4514.84s -> 4526.86s]  I'm out. How do I leave? Oh you got a new info. How do I get the fuck out of here?
[4527.50s -> 4533.67s]  All I can do for you is recommend something to read Quinlan. How about Marchox the da Vinci
[4533.67s -> 4539.67s]  engine? It's a study that reveals how Leonardo theorized cyberspace back in the 17th century.
[4544.33s -> 4553.66s]  How do I leave? Oh you have to press escape. All right I got new info. I'm gonna it's midnight
[4553.66s -> 4562.18s]  always. Watch out for the skull. Dangerous. Watch out for the I don't know what that was. Sun. Moon.
[4563.29s -> 4590.20s]  I. Exit. Exit cyberspace. Yes. Okay whew whew. Jake if anything should happen to me
[4591.08s -> 4604.46s]  lose the crystals. Look to the crystals and let the light shine your way. All right where's like
[4604.46s -> 4623.59s]  the I want to fight. I think I gotta go talk to the chief. No not this way. Don't fight. It's okay.
[4624.31s -> 4633.74s]  There's an this is an adventure game. There is no fighting. It says there's combat in the game.
[4635.98s -> 4639.66s]  There is combat in the game and I'm gonna see it. There we are. I want to go in here.
[4644.68s -> 4655.13s]  No why are you leaving? Here we are. Here we go. Ben dogs. Give me a new area and we're gonna get
[4655.13s -> 4669.42s]  our first fist fight. Hey Ben. How's Catherine today? No change. Now his coat looks like it's
[4669.42s -> 4677.27s]  made out of licorice. I'm not gonna lie. This guy's the devil himself. Ben you know this cop
[4677.27s -> 4686.41s]  Magnata? Typical new breed cop. One of those guys started arresting people in volume when cops started
[4686.41s -> 4693.13s]  to select. Salami. He's uh been more aggressive than most. Yeah that's common knowledge but
[4693.13s -> 4698.89s]  what's his story? He's killed six people in the line of duty summoned to questionable circumstances.
[4699.53s -> 4708.23s]  He's bad news. I wouldn't mess with him Quentin. Do the funny voice which one is Ben? All right
[4708.23s -> 4715.11s]  where's uh what about Joey Falconetti? You ever hear of a Joey Falconetti Ben? No the name sounds
[4715.11s -> 4723.72s]  vaguely familiar but I can't quite place it. All right well let's go let's get out of here. I'm
[4723.72s -> 4734.90s]  going to see Joey. I can't wait to change disc because that I mean that was just hold on I got
[4734.90s -> 4746.39s]  a belch coming you don't like this song it's not gonna be over just relax guys we only have
[4746.39s -> 4757.30s]  like another four to five hours in this game so pull up a chair sit down because I've lied to
[4757.30s -> 4762.74s]  you this whole this whole evening this is all I got out of all the fmv games I try to get to work
[4762.74s -> 4768.42s]  and this is the only one that works so I mean I would do this is a good one I think how do I
[4768.50s -> 4782.95s]  leave the fucking building I want to leave the building and if you think that's legit
[4783.67s -> 4802.68s]  you're out of your mind okay leave the fucking building I want to leave the office stop
[4803.32s -> 4813.43s]  stop stop stop stop turn around oh my god and then I have to go here and then have to turn
[4813.43s -> 4822.34s]  it around from here my goodness all right what we got newsroom uh cafe du champ

[4831.58s -> 4838.70s]  profession's way lawyer reporter for the herald low end of the pay scale hey tell me about it
[4838.70s -> 4842.94s]  you should work for yourself there are thousands of ways to make money in the net believe me I know
[4843.58s -> 4854.06s]  the internet is he drinking out of a manila envelope or is it a candle he's drinking out
[4854.06s -> 4860.76s]  of a candle do you know joey falconetti joey falconetti I haven't done business with that

[4866.44s -> 4872.28s]  emoticon franchise you know one of those sea space emotional counter zones this was years ago
[4872.28s -> 4877.80s]  legitimate business why can't that just be a real mug eddie's a thief by nature robbed it blind
[4878.52s -> 4884.84s]  we had to sell out to some palestinians in new dallas I've worked with eddie since but I
[4884.84s -> 4889.88s]  I keep an eye on him so he doesn't pilfer any of my is this still the same game from before

[5108.90s -> 5113.38s]  decking with the global net since it went online present at the creation
[5115.21s -> 5118.89s]  that's why thugs like falcon eddie disappointment damn waste of talent
[5121.34s -> 5126.58s]  you want another one i can get you another one what about down here is this a computer game

[14834.52s -> 14848.25s]  that's all you can do especially when it comes to health problems we also had uh ten dollars come
[14848.25s -> 14860.50s]  in from uruhara thanks for the ten bucks no message just ten dollars a few of these back

[14873.54s -> 14882.06s]  years or so you're easily my favorite content creator on both platforms let's see if i can
[14882.06s -> 14916.76s]  keep that going i'm gonna try oh lord phylactery holy shit man how does he do it i don't know but
[14916.76s -> 14938.57s]  they continue to do that's 69 more community subs from phylactery religion that puts you
[14939.88s -> 14945.16s]  you are now responsible for a very large percentage of the people that have subscribed
[14945.16s -> 14965.38s]  to this channel now that's a pretty significant portion of people that are subbed so thank you
[14966.20s -> 14974.95s]  completely completely unnecessary at this point because that's so much money i hope you can afford
[14974.95s -> 14983.78s]  it if you can then fucking awesome i'm i'm glad you got a lot of money if you can't make sure
[14983.78s -> 14995.22s]  you're taking care of yourself first that's very important he owns you now i got too loud i'm not
[14995.22s -> 15001.85s]  supposed to be getting loud but phylactery that's an insane amount of subs sometimes this happens
[15001.85s -> 15007.45s]  somebody gives a shitload of money over the course of a month or two and it just floors me
[15007.45s -> 15013.21s]  so i can't believe it i'm shocked that somebody wouldn't want to give me this much money as one
[15013.21s -> 15025.45s]  single person so thank you i hope you can afford it thank you doctor and chat yeah and good luck
[15025.45s -> 15037.78s]  in with your with your patients because you're obviously a doctor and a scientist combined oh

[15050.12s -> 15053.88s]  switch to this because i i do have i'm gonna go take like a bath or something just so
[15053.88s -> 15063.26s]  i'm gonna like soak my head in water um probably not not now i don't want to say yeah maybe sure
[15063.26s -> 15068.12s]  maybe you'll see it so i don't want to do that because there's so much stuff going on over the
[15068.12s -> 15073.00s]  next few weeks that that this would end up being another one of those scenarios where
[15073.96s -> 15079.96s]  oh yeah maybe a few weeks on and then in end of october someone's gonna ask the same question
[15079.96s -> 15091.53s]  and i'm gonna be like oh yeah um maybe you know maybe a few weeks so i don't want to tell people
[15091.53s -> 15097.48s]  that i'm gonna be doing things and then just not do them when's the carnival it's the 21st
[15098.20s -> 15108.52s]  the carnival is next week next weekend september 21st i also want to say something about the
[15108.60s -> 15116.09s]  activity book stream so if you have not get a submission in for the activity book because

[15123.51s -> 15134.47s]  have been live for a long time so i think it's time to close them up so on friday uh probably
[15134.47s -> 15143.45s]  like i don't know midnight pacific we're going to be closing those up and then that stream
[15144.25s -> 15151.21s]  will be the last stream that i do before leaving to go and do the carnival stream so i'm going to
[15151.21s -> 15156.65s]  give you some dates here because it's pretty important because this next week is going to be

[15192.62s -> 15197.10s]  last stream until the 21st or the 17th i haven't decided yet depends on how much time i need to
[15197.10s -> 15203.51s]  get ready because the 17th is when yeah the 16th into the 17th is when i have to get out of here
[15206.65s -> 15215.06s]  he's quitting to become a clown maybe no not quitting make sure you pack your toothbrush
[15215.94s -> 15222.39s]  i will is there gonna be any behind the scenes stuff for the carnival i think andy mark is

[15230.84s -> 15237.58s]  but then twitchcon twitchcon is that next week so it's gonna be it's gonna be all over the place
[15242.30s -> 15246.94s]  streams are gonna be a little bit of a juggle after this week just because of twitchcon and
[15246.94s -> 15263.21s]  the carnival and everything i'm looking forward to it i can't wait but tentatively that activity
[15263.21s -> 15269.29s]  book stream will be probably on the 16th and it's just gonna be us hanging out no pressure
[15269.29s -> 15274.17s]  no nothing from anybody just fun little activities and jokes and stuff that people
[15274.17s -> 15280.33s]  wrote and submitted i'm gonna compile it all into a big pdf and i'm gonna do it all on stream
[15280.97s -> 15290.36s]  we're just gonna hang out it's gonna it'll be a nice hangout stream i can assure you what time is
[15290.36s -> 15300.86s]  the carnival going to be i have i do have a time for you september 21st at 12 pm eastern time is

[15313.75s -> 15323.93s]  12 ish but i think we got a pretty hard start for 12 eastern and that isn't a weekend too so
[15324.73s -> 15337.16s]  it's saturday you're on pacific i'm sorry but the stream will be on eastern time how long is it
[15337.16s -> 15347.58s]  gonna last the time frame has been blocked out for somewhere between four and six hours we're
[15347.58s -> 15359.18s]  shooting for somewhere around five five hours six hours or so there's a lot going on on this stream
[15359.98s -> 15372.82s]  let me tell you this ain't just this ain't just a little dunk tank a lot going on here with a bunch
[15372.82s -> 15378.58s]  of technical difficulties um i don't think so because there are a bunch of engineers working
[15378.58s -> 15384.02s]  on this and a full production company so there are two different companies that are doing this
[15384.02s -> 15392.02s]  and me so it's not just me and hey okay now let me turn them on it's it's probably about 10 to
[15392.82s -> 15397.94s]  there's probably about 10 to 15 people that are going to be like on site working on this at the
[15397.94s -> 15407.32s]  same time maybe a little bit more are you doing rehearsals yes we are that's why i'm not i am

[15421.50s -> 15427.82s]  real soon i just want to get over there you know what i mean you know when something's about to
[15427.82s -> 15433.64s]  happen and you know what it's going to be and you know what it it's probably going to look like
[15434.28s -> 15438.04s]  that's every night i just go to bed and i just i think about it it's gonna be fucking awesome
[15438.04s -> 15447.42s]  it's gonna be so fun i can't wait it's weird because it's actually made it's almost like when

[15493.13s -> 15498.33s]  and then be in like a bunch of fucking pain and shit and then it's like oh canceling the stream
[15498.33s -> 15507.56s]  tomorrow sorry guys i can't do it i don't want to do that what was the reason that cox died

[15630.31s -> 15635.19s]  well this company wanted to do that but i didn't want to do that i've been just i've been trying
[15635.19s -> 15642.17s]  to do more high production stuff for like two or three years and shit always just didn't work out
[15643.19s -> 15654.22s]  and it is now so as of september 21st start expecting stuff like that to happen way more

[16039.90s -> 16043.82s]  uh you also have recently said that spider-man far from home is your favorite marvel movie
[16043.82s -> 16050.82s]  it is also the first marvel movie to not have a stanley cameo it's an observation um well that's
[16051.70s -> 16057.51s]  here's the thing that i didn't i never said that i never said that i didn't like the stanley cameo
[16059.10s -> 16067.11s]  everybody loves the fucking stanley cameos okay all i said was i did not say that i didn't say that i
[16067.11s -> 16071.75s]  said that stanley cameos back you know this is a few years three four years ago whatever it was
[16072.39s -> 16077.91s]  or two years ago what does spider-man come up anyway so the spider-man the stanley cameos all
[16077.91s -> 16082.39s]  i said was it makes you very aware that you're watching a movie it makes you very aware that
[16082.39s -> 16086.87s]  you're playing a video game that was it i still like them i still think they're fun and interesting
[16086.95s -> 16103.34s]  of course i do of course i do when did spider-man come out well originally nobody cares you

[16248.60s -> 16253.22s]  he shows up to answer your question but far from home is the best spider-man movie there's there's
[16253.22s -> 16266.95s]  no debate there there isn't you want to debate me about this i'll open up the debate right now

[16299.11s -> 16307.58s]  the top four there it is homecoming better than far from home that's tough for me i don't know
[16307.58s -> 16317.88s]  about that far from home is an overrated movie now i am going to purge that i'm going to purge that

[16346.07s -> 16359.21s]  so i can actually go lie down because my brain right now is like working triple time so let's
[16359.21s -> 16368.01s]  go where are we where did we end up oh up here okay oh yeah because phylactery came with a
[16368.01s -> 16375.53s]  shitload of substance just knock down so many things so many messages got like just
[16377.03s -> 16389.56s]  pushed up because of it thank you to uh sin sin access stead for the five dollars thank you uh sin
[16390.12s -> 16394.41s]  hey jeremy thanks you for thank you for being epic and making me feel better when i need it love your
[16394.41s -> 16405.46s]  content love you more thank you for five dollars appreciate it thank you flug boy for the five
[16405.46s -> 16413.06s]  dollars i'm trying to fix my dumb mental state lately and i think uh and i'm always moved at
[16413.06s -> 16417.46s]  the fact that you can still manage to lift some sort of weight off of me when i can tune into a
[16417.46s -> 16421.54s]  stream i've been on a roller coaster ride of emotions and i will say you help slow it down
[16425.46s -> 16435.48s]  i wish you the best take it slow work on yourself however you know you can because you're the only
[16435.56s -> 16449.99s]  one that knows how to do that i am honored to lift some weight off of you and anybody else
[16456.81s -> 16463.21s]  i just want the streams to be fun i don't i don't care about anything else you know what i'm saying
[16463.85s -> 16468.73s]  i want you to have fun i want us to enjoy the streams together i want obviously i want to have
[16468.73s -> 16474.34s]  fun i want to enjoy what i'm doing i want us to collectively think everything is a fun time
[16476.10s -> 16483.86s]  nothing else nothing else matters it really doesn't so when people tell me that it's they're
[16483.86s -> 16499.82s]  having fun and it's like helping them and it's shit it's that means a lot i like how you don't
[16499.82s -> 16512.74s]  make it all about yourself that's pretty cool um well it isn't it can't be because you you're
[16512.74s -> 16519.40s]  the ones that have to be entertained you know what i mean as much as it's about me it is also about
[16519.40s -> 16526.15s]  you the reason why i try to do things that might be more fun or more entertaining sometimes
[16526.79s -> 16530.87s]  is because i want you to watch like for instance the carnival i i'm not doing the carnival
[16531.43s -> 16536.63s]  just because well you know either like let me just like piss away a bunch of money
[16537.43s -> 16541.99s]  and oh i can't wait this is gonna be great for me i'm gonna have a lot of fun here
[16543.70s -> 16547.62s]  you know what i'm not even gonna turn on the stream i think i'm just gonna not turn the stream
[16547.62s -> 16553.83s]  on and just have a carnival no it's because it's potentially a fun interesting thing that
[16553.83s -> 16558.15s]  you guys can participate in that i think and i that interests me that's why i only look
[16559.72s -> 16569.37s]  if something interests me i'm gonna do it it doesn't matter what it is it's gonna happen
[16571.08s -> 16578.17s]  i get so stuck and locked in on doing things that i think would be fun for the stream sometimes to
[16578.17s -> 16584.79s]  the detriment sometimes to my own detriment but then i think about oh but that would be fun
[16584.79s -> 16588.79s]  wouldn't it i think people would think that was fun i think that's fun maybe they would too
[16589.59s -> 16602.57s]  that's all i need to hear that's all i need to know that's why he spent five million dollars
[16602.57s -> 16625.19s]  on the carnival i mean i think you're pretty close not for real i i wouldn't be doing it
[16626.84s -> 16633.69s]  if i wasn't having a good time and it didn't interest me and if it wasn't interesting you
[16634.41s -> 16637.67s]  because i don't you know you know i don't want to have one of those i don't have like a stream
[16637.75s -> 16643.00s]  where it's just like every day it's just like hey i don't i don't like this at all
[16644.18s -> 16654.20s]  oh okay well i don't i don't want that i don't want you to do that now some streams will be
[16654.20s -> 16662.49s]  more exciting i think than others and i can't have something crazy fucking like i can't have
[16662.49s -> 16677.91s]  like a carnival stream every fucking stream that's impossible but it is on my mind all the time but
[16677.99s -> 16688.89s]  thank you why not now you are talking five million dollars that is that number is real
[16688.89s -> 16706.65s]  if that is the case but thank you flood boy thank you future gamer for the 250 what is the current
[16706.65s -> 16712.25s]  sub count at also how many emote slots has phylactery opened on their own uh we're currently
[16712.25s -> 16724.65s]  at 5,800 5,875 subs 74 subs we are currently down from the peak of about 7,000 which was just
[16724.65s -> 16736.52s]  fucking crazy if you remember that do you guys remember like four months ago when i had like
[16736.52s -> 16750.06s]  seven fucking thousands of that was fucking crazy so it's we've kind of evened out a little bit here
[16751.38s -> 16769.24s]  add another fucking crazy number when did it get so high this year it fluctuates though
[16769.88s -> 16777.26s]  so it'll go it's i can't give you like an exact i mean that's the current snapshot of subscribers
[16777.26s -> 16784.38s]  right now it's a month or two from now that might drop a couple thousand it might go up a couple
[16784.38s -> 16791.50s]  thousand i have no idea it's kind of all over the place when it comes to um just like exact numbers
[16791.50s -> 16800.28s]  it's kind of hard to tell but there are 5,874 right this second i haven't even begun to pick
[16801.67s -> 16807.03s]  followers per month is increasing too well cool good i hope you like the streams because that's
