[5.50s -> 36.12s]  Did it work? What the hell was that? I don't know why it reverted back to 720p for no reason.
[36.12s -> 45.93s]  Output, scaled resolution, 1536x864 selected. Done. No, I had to click on use custom resolution,
[46.81s -> 53.96s]  put in a custom one, hit apply and then hit done. But there's a drop down menu where I can select
[53.96s -> 59.90s]  it. I hate this program with a passion. It's like one of three programs that exist to stream on.
[59.90s -> 74.07s]  You have three choices. Curly, Moe, and Larry. Alright, anyways, hi guys. How's everybody doing?
[78.33s -> 87.18s]  Which one is this? I don't know. Now you're gonna ask me to go stream on like the NVIDIA
[87.18s -> 97.98s]  fucking shadowplay. I'm not gonna do that. That's not gonna happen. I was doing fine until I had
[97.98s -> 103.18s]  to restart my stream fucking and give notifications to people that it just dumped on a bunch of people
[103.18s -> 118.02s]  and they all saw no stream. Fucking real happy about that. YouTube streamings made- no, no
[118.02s -> 129.90s]  YouTube streaming. I bet Jaren's playing this on easy baby mode. I'm playing it on- listen to my voice.
[129.90s -> 136.76s]  I'm cured. Not 900p. You're not actually- you're not supposed to stream at 900p.
[137.48s -> 143.98s]  Did some research. It's actually kind of- it's actually a little worse.
[144.62s -> 148.54s]  Something to do with how like the pixels get broadcasted or something. I don't know.
[149.75s -> 155.02s]  Anyways, why does everything have to start with so- I swear to god. Like everything just starts so
[155.02s -> 171.29s]  negatively. Why doesn't shit just work? It's 964, not 864. Yeah, well whatever.
[171.93s -> 179.77s]  Did you remember to get the FOV mod? I didn't get the FOV mod because I've been playing the game
[179.77s -> 186.90s]  at 81 FOV the whole time and I've gotten used to it already. So I'm just gonna play the way
[186.90s -> 192.50s]  the developer is intended. The 20- never mind. I don't want to get into this. I don't- no,
[192.50s -> 197.38s]  we're not starting every stream with like- I'm angry. Okay, that can't happen. But just it
[197.38s -> 207.75s]  somehow happens that every time I start a stream something annoying happens. Every time. We're
[207.75s -> 216.44s]  gonna continue. No, don't blame me. Blame our annoying world we live in. It's not me,
[216.44s -> 239.83s]  it's our annoying world. It's- it's our society. Angry. Angsty. I'm not angsty. I'm fine. I'm like
[239.83s -> 250.06s]  a can of soda. Don't you understand? Like when you open up a can of soda like- a bunch of fucking
[250.06s -> 257.27s]  like rage- air comes out of it. And it tastes really really good for like 20 minutes. After
[257.27s -> 264.44s]  like an hour or two of the soda sitting there, it's gross. Don't shake me up either. Don't shake
[264.44s -> 284.73s]  me up! Though it does not imply to stop watching the stream after like 30 minutes. Don't do that.
[284.73s -> 306.84s]  Stay. Next game? What? No. I'm playing Resident Evil Village. See you after 30 minutes.
[307.40s -> 318.62s]  All right, so what do we leave off? Did I get a beard in one day? I think this was here yesterday,
[318.62s -> 326.62s]  it was dark. Planned your whole day around this stream? I didn't even tweet this stream was live.
[329.82s -> 343.13s]  Did I? No, I didn't. Did I? Did I? No, there's no tweet. Hope everyone's doing well. Hope you're
[343.13s -> 347.37s]  having a good day. I know we went for- I can't- no, I can't do that transition. It doesn't work like
[347.37s -> 360.06s]  that. Hey, how is everybody doing? Hope you're having a great day. Yeah, good to see you. You
[360.06s -> 372.82s]  can't start that angry and be like, oh hey, by the way, how's your day? Finishing RE Village.
[372.82s -> 385.77s]  Somebody said I have really boring tweets. I mean, I don't- I don't even use Twitter. Okay,
[385.77s -> 399.78s]  there we go. Boring tweets. What else do I have to tell you? So if I'm- okay, if I'm playing
[399.78s -> 406.22s]  Resident Evil Village today, like I'm playing Resident Evil Village right now, come on over
[406.22s -> 411.42s]  if you want to, right? Why do I have to have- I'll add like a bunch of like fucking like emojis and
[411.42s -> 417.34s]  shit. And like- I don't know, like dancing GIFs. Like I don't- that- I'm just- I'm live right now.
[417.34s -> 423.08s]  Come watch or- or don't. I'm sure- you know what? I'm sure- here, how about this, ready?
[423.08s -> 426.95s]  Let's do an experiment. Let's see how many more engagements I get. I want someone to clip
[426.95s -> 432.20s]  this and GIF it. You know what I mean? Like I gotta have like a cool like I'm going live tweet,
[432.20s -> 447.22s]  right? Like- and then like loop that and I'll use it tomorrow. Oh, not tomorrow, next week.
[447.22s -> 470.09s]  Going live! You gonna show up? That was terrible. Doesn't have to be good. Lazy comedy? No, it's
[470.09s -> 478.26s]  just like I- like I just tell you that I'm live. I don't have to do anything else. That's visible
[478.26s -> 485.91s]  regret. Not really. All right, so where we going? Uh, underwater. Those of you that didn't see the
[485.91s -> 493.51s]  stream yesterday, we got to a point. We got to, uh, three out of the four pieces of a thing. If
[493.51s -> 499.06s]  you haven't seen any of the game, this is a spoiler. If you don't want to get spoiled,
[499.06s -> 505.51s]  the Resident Evil Village and I suggest you close your ears. This is like my daughter's body, okay?
[506.57s -> 511.21s]  Uh, we need the- I'm on the third piece right now. We got it, but it's not the end. We have to
[511.21s -> 523.32s]  go through this weird puke guy that falls in the river. Double audio. Might have a- had a- might
[523.88s -> 530.78s]  have an audio problem? What happened? I don't have any drop frames. Looks good on my end.
[530.78s -> 539.58s]  Does something happen? I have zero drop frames for now. All right, so, uh, we- this is like the swamp
[539.58s -> 550.25s]  level. And I got a- I have a code here. This is the code. It's three red, one two three tic tac toe,
[551.42s -> 556.78s]  and then two blue, and then solid blue top right. So I'll represent- if somebody will screenshot
[556.78s -> 566.39s]  that and just give it to me later, that's good. You can hear the audio twice? It's echoing. The game
[566.39s -> 579.53s]  is echoing. The game audio is weird? Is it? The game audio. How would that be happening?
[584.86s -> 590.06s]  Oh, am I getting trolled? Why are you doing this to me? It's fine. Hold on, let me do a test.
[591.66s -> 602.28s]  We good? It's not one guy? It's fine. Okay, all right. Mod just said it's fine. I'm going
[603.88s -> 614.66s]  perfectly fine. It's fine. Okay, all right, all right, all right. Why is- why is everyone doing
[614.66s -> 623.42s]  this? All right, so I gotta go down. The exit's underwater. I gotta drain the water.
[624.22s -> 628.38s]  So the question is now go- oh, that way, because the chicken. Yep, okay. All right, all right,
[628.38s -> 632.98s]  I know what I'm going. I know what I'm doing. We like to do a little bit of trolling here in
[632.98s -> 642.20s]  this community. It's literally not fine. I cannot think of a reason why this would be happening,
[642.20s -> 671.77s]  though. It's actually definitely echoing. It's doubled? Hold on. It's not like playing my stream
[671.77s -> 682.94s]  in the background, right? No. Is your stream muted in the other window? Yeah, yeah, it should be fine.
[682.94s -> 686.86s]  I don't know why that would- that's really weird. It's the game audio doing it.
[688.89s -> 695.34s]  Let me see. It's not actually a troll. It sounds like the audio is going through a fan.
[695.90s -> 700.70s]  It's got a weird echo effect. It only sounds fine because it's a sound effect not spoken.
[700.70s -> 712.60s]  When Ethan spoke right at the beginning, it was noticeably weird. I'm so confused. Nothing
[712.60s -> 719.93s]  changed from yesterday besides talk to Duke to confirm it. All right, yeah, this is- that's
[719.93s -> 726.52s]  really strange. I don't know why this would be happening. Let me go- hold on.
[744.44s -> 775.54s]  How's that? It's there. It's kind of weird. Let me restart the game and see what happens.
[776.18s -> 783.94s]  It's like metallic? Yeah, let me just restart because I don't hear that, though.
[785.56s -> 790.02s]  It sounds normal to me. It sounds like he's talking inside of a pipe.
[790.74s -> 801.21s]  Oh, let me see. We deleted the links. Yeah, that sounds perfectly normal to me.
[801.21s -> 805.38s]  Let me just- let me restart the game. Hold on. Give me one sec. Give me one second.
[823.32s -> 830.79s]  Sounds cool. You should leave. This is very strange. Sounds like it's being piped into OBS
[830.79s -> 835.27s]  twice. Like we're getting desktop and also a separate input for the game, like a capture card.
[835.27s -> 837.75s]  Let me listen to it. Hold on. That's really weird.
[838.87s -> 843.26s]  As you wish.
[844.78s -> 856.79s]  What the fuck is going on? What? That's so weird. Why is that happening? Yeah, it's- it's playing
[856.79s -> 862.49s]  twice. The audio is playing twice, right next to each other, but nothing is doing that.
[863.05s -> 871.59s]  Hold on. Let me see. The only thing pulling audio is the GoXLR and the routing on the GoXLR is-
[875.48s -> 885.11s]  so now I'm pulling myself in here. Okay, so that shouldn't be happening. This is so weird. Okay,
[885.11s -> 890.82s]  um, I'm gonna try to pull it through one more time and see if it fixes it because this- I
[890.82s -> 898.22s]  cannot think of a solution as why this would be happening. Try it again. Hold on. The only thing
[898.22s -> 906.22s]  that changed is I changed it to- I moved my OBS settings to make it so it would stream at
[906.22s -> 915.34s]  864 and I made my CPU preset slower so it would look better. That's the only thing I did. Let me-
[915.34s -> 918.70s]  hold on. Let me just confirm something with you guys right now. I'm gonna like play a sound effect.
[919.42s -> 933.34s]  Tell me if it sounds weird. Ready? Did that sound weird? Was that echoed at all or anything?
[934.38s -> 939.51s]  That one sounds fine. So why would- so wouldn't- hold on. Maybe it was just a Resident Evil
[939.51s -> 944.58s]  problem. Try this again. Oh, I'm sorry. The technical fucking problem's Andy.
[945.22s -> 965.96s]  Choose a different sound effect. Let's try a different sound effect. Well, that one has
[965.96s -> 976.89s]  reverb on it. That doesn't help us. That one has reverb. That one has echo. How about just like,
[976.89s -> 993.22s]  I don't know, like man talking. Okay, how about- or just like punch sound. This would do it, right?
[993.78s -> 1023.70s]  How's that? It auto-played. Hold on. Hold on. Oh shit! All right, I got the problem. I know
[1023.70s -> 1028.02s]  the problem is I got it. Problem is done. Problem has been solved. I figured it out. We're okay.
[1028.02s -> 1032.50s]  Everybody's fine. We're gonna play Resident Evil Village now. Problem has been figured out.
[1032.50s -> 1040.42s]  I got it. I should got it. Let's see. There it is. Okay, we're good.
[1046.46s -> 1055.62s]  The problem was for some reason it was pulling my audio twice. I don't know why this shit happens.
[1055.62s -> 1066.78s]  I'm so- I'm as confused as you guys are. Trust me. That definitely- that absolutely fixed it.
[1066.78s -> 1081.43s]  No way. No chance that it didn't. Let's come back. Hello. Hi. We should be good to go.
[1082.07s -> 1088.30s]  I don't think I've ever- have I ever- have I ever had a normal fucking stream? Like, has a stream
[1088.30s -> 1094.82s]  ever started normally? Ever. Every stream it's always like something weird happens or like I'm
[1094.82s -> 1099.78s]  fucking mad at everything. There's never been a normal start to a stream. I have to get- I have
[1099.78s -> 1105.40s]  to get normal. I have to have a normal start to a stream. Like, hi guys. How's everybody doing?
[1105.40s -> 1116.86s]  Mm-hmm. Resident Evil Village part two incoming here. Here we are. We were at the gatehouse last
[1116.86s -> 1144.70s]  time because you're not normal. Yes, I am. I am. How dare you say that? Did it fix it? We're good,
[1144.70s -> 1154.34s]  I think. Yeah. Get to the game already. I'm trying, man. I'm sorry. All right, let's go.
[1156.02s -> 1165.22s]  It's been 20 fucking minutes. I hate my streamer ability. All right, let's go. No, wrong way.
[1165.38s -> 1173.72s]  He said the exit's under the water. Don't be normal. Well, sometimes I have to be. Like,
[1173.72s -> 1178.63s]  for instance, I got a job interview. I just wish that one stream would start where I don't like
[1178.63s -> 1186.71s]  curse out a company. I tell- you know what's wicked funny? Last night I was lying in bed
[1187.43s -> 1192.23s]  and I said to myself, I said, you know what? I'm from- I'm not gonna like curse any more companies
[1192.23s -> 1195.91s]  anymore. I'm just gonna like just, you know, if I'm annoyed, I'll just be annoyed. Cursed out a
[1195.91s -> 1200.15s]  company the first fucking five seconds of the stream. I actually cursed a company out and then
[1200.15s -> 1207.58s]  turned the stream off and came back. All right, I already have the crank. I think I do, right? Yeah.
[1207.58s -> 1213.66s]  Oh, no, no, no. I did not. I did this part after. All right, so I got the crank.
[1216.06s -> 1222.12s]  I broke the crank off. I said, well, that's annoying, right? So I had said get to the
[1222.12s -> 1226.57s]  second windmill. So we're going to try to get to the second windmill. We're normal. I'm normal
[1226.57s -> 1231.26s]  today. Somebody gave 10 community- thanks for the 10 community subs. Appreciate it. That was from
[1231.26s -> 1236.44s]  Void. Thanks for the 10 community subs. 10 of them. That's a lot of money. Thank you.
[1237.00s -> 1243.14s]  What part am I on? This is uh, I'm just gonna say- I'm gonna say Igor and then maybe you'll know
[1243.14s -> 1249.99s]  what that means. I got that and I had to find a way to the second windmill. I'm gonna be normal
[1249.99s -> 1256.81s]  today. No like fucking weird movements. No like screaming and shit. No cursing out Fortune 500
[1256.81s -> 1262.17s]  companies to take me off the guest list of every fucking exclusive party I could ever be invited
[1262.17s -> 1277.29s]  to. No more of that. I'm normal today. I'm gonna try to go inside, right? Go in and then down. All
[1277.29s -> 1285.10s]  right. Here we go. I'm normal today. Don't listen to them. Don't listen to all- like thank you Cat
[1285.10s -> 1298.62s]  Sum for the five community subs. Here comes a joke. No, I'm gonna be normal. I wanted to so badly do
[1298.62s -> 1308.34s]  like a beat to that, but that would not be normal. Now would it? All right, let's- I'm gonna- let's
[1308.34s -> 1312.74s]  make a little friendly bet here. Let's see how long I can be normal. Like just like just normal.
[1312.74s -> 1318.52s]  I'm gonna say- I'm gonna try to go for 10 minutes of just normal. No, nothing. Just be a normal- just
[1318.52s -> 1330.68s]  be a fucking normal person. Just sit here and play a game. 10 minutes starting now. Ooh, cool. Oh,
[1330.68s -> 1336.55s]  does it look better? That's another question I have. How much better does the stream look?
[1336.55s -> 1348.09s]  Does it look good? Better than yesterday? Looks about the same. Looks a little bit better. A bit
[1348.09s -> 1359.80s]  better. Same. Not as good as you. Thanks. Okay, let me keep walking. Ooh, we can break that.
[1359.80s -> 1395.50s]  Normal's boring. Let me just see if I- I lost! Holy shit! I died? That was it? I got really scared
[1395.50s -> 1399.66s]  and I looked into the camera and I realized that was being weird so I just made it- I- okay. I made
[1399.82s -> 1406.18s]  extra weird. I was like- I looked over, I turned, I saw like in the preview over here how weird I
[1406.18s -> 1418.15s]  looked, and then I was like I'll add some weirdness to it because I already lost.
[1418.15s -> 1422.95s]  Lost to normal wheel. All right, so just don't get eaten. That's easier said than done.
[1426.66s -> 1432.70s]  I'll rip and run! All right, is there a place I can hide? I don't know where to go. This way?
[1437.51s -> 1453.78s]  Where the- where am I? Where do I go? Ah! What does that do? Oh my god, he's gonna jump and kill me.
[1458.22s -> 1478.55s]  Ah! Can I go? Oh my god, what's- is there a ladder? What's happening? I don't understand
[1478.55s -> 1489.32s]  what's going on. Where's the ladder? I have to knock it down? Why is this not going down?
[1489.32s -> 1508.60s]  On the other side. What other side? Oh, fuck you game. There's 50 subs? I missed 50 subs. Well,
[1508.60s -> 1540.06s]  thank you. Tuber voice. No, that was a tuber face. All right, come on, let's go. Oh, I changed to E,
[1540.06s -> 1562.41s]  right? All right, get out of the way. Oh shit! I had to go the other way. Just restart. I thought
[1562.41s -> 1567.08s]  I could get there fast. I thought I could get there before he did it. Who gave the 50 subs?
[1567.08s -> 1570.89s]  I only gave 50 community subs. I need to know who it was. Don't go on the planks.
[1571.53s -> 1616.66s]  Okay, wait, he's gonna do a big jump. Okay, now he's gonna come this way and then run around.
[1617.46s -> 1626.50s]  What the fuck? Wait, he- I didn't- go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go

[5381.02s -> 5396.63s]  yesterday okay now i want to go down here this is where i got in trouble last time trying to
[5396.63s -> 5414.86s]  figure out how to get around here we go again rtx is not on and the only reason why it's not on
[5415.66s -> 5422.36s]  is because one of my fans stopped working in the front of the case and i'm i don't know i'm it's
[5423.32s -> 5427.80s]  in the 3090s run real hot i don't want it to run at like 110 celsius like for six hours
[5428.52s -> 5436.44s]  this way how do i get over here right like remember this remember this nonsense if i go
[5436.44s -> 5449.67s]  straight from here and i'll be able to go this way and then in here rtx will get you more viewers
[5450.47s -> 5465.64s]  at the chicken through the chicken pen ice no so what's gonna happen is i will stream
[5465.64s -> 5470.68s]  i whatever game comes up i can utilize it i will play games with rtx on and everything
[5471.00s -> 5489.46s]  all right where's this chicken i want to get a substantial cooling system for this thing
[5489.46s -> 5496.58s]  because this thing seriously runs hot hot hot hot hot like super hot like holy shit hot
[5500.41s -> 5504.17s]  i don't i can't get that through here the same problem that i had last time is trying to find
[5504.17s -> 5509.13s]  the one specific route to go around like three different circles to find your way around to like
[5509.13s -> 5519.90s]  down here so i have to go this way i have to get over here so if i go through here then i can go
[5519.90s -> 5529.56s]  straight and then wrap around this way so i need to get over here go through the shortcut window
[5529.56s -> 5555.45s]  super super overthinking andy um what do you mean oh there it is okay overthinking andy
[5556.62s -> 5569.19s]  locked due to missing homeowner all right let's get the whatever this is in here yeah i also think
[5569.19s -> 5575.59s]  i might want a solution for my cpu too because i have uh i have a ryzen 5700 or something it's
[5575.59s -> 5580.15s]  one of those eight core like 10 core or something could be and i i don't want like a stock fan on

[5587.69s -> 5597.72s]  i don't know maybe oh oh shit i don't have no i don't have a stock fan on it i say i don't
[5598.28s -> 5607.08s]  that's my point the 3090 just has a stock fan system and that's like i don't for 3090
[5607.08s -> 5611.91s]  i don't know it's like there's a car in my room i don't i kind of want something better than that

[7140.82s -> 7144.74s]  health kits i feel like i'm terrible at this game and terrible at video games in general

[7214.04s -> 7250.18s]  you go must go on take a break um not yet i think we'll get a break in soon though is he up on there
[7250.18s -> 7260.28s]  where is he that sounded like he was right next to me oh that's where all the wait those are not bad
[7260.28s -> 7292.92s]  i thought those were the big um like flying bat bad people things oh my nerve give me the money

[7362.34s -> 7389.29s]  why are you giving me this stuff get why are you giving me this you give me this for a reason
[7389.29s -> 7396.70s]  anytime you see like a highly explosive device in one of these games something horrible happens
[7430.25s -> 7452.65s]  oh you're climbing i'm almost at a handgun bullets i need handgun ammo i should really
[7452.65s -> 7457.62s]  craft some i told you i'm a i'm a big handgun guy i love using handguns in games it's what i
[7457.62s -> 7466.84s]  use the most the reason why i'm not good at counter-strike or any of those games that require
[7466.84s -> 7472.65s]  you to be like good at a video game is because i can't do like the crouch and hit people and
[7472.65s -> 7479.19s]  hit no but you give me the deagle and i'll go bump up i'll hit you i can win but like i always get
[7479.19s -> 7488.79s]  outplayed by the person that can like crouch shoot you a crowd let's get this door open how
[7488.79s -> 7501.48s]  do we do it is that what is back here there's a treasure over here somewhere like right here
[7501.48s -> 7526.06s]  doesn't hurt you right standing on top of it is that it right there no wait what there's gotta
[7526.06s -> 7533.66s]  be a way i think it's up read the name of the treasure treasure under the stronghold
[7534.86s -> 7559.86s]  it's not above me then all right a way up a way up way is shot it was made for those who are dead
[7560.50s -> 7569.16s]  this is peter jackson's least favorite part of the movie he wanted to delete this part he was so
[7569.16s -> 7573.32s]  desperate to remove this part from the movie because he's despised and he thought it was too

[8455.91s -> 8461.56s]  potentially the most powerful entity they can change the course of all history you know that
[8461.56s -> 8468.15s]  if you've been in this community for long enough what do you mean one guy who is a typewriter
[8482.23s -> 8498.07s]  not more of that shit is there what is in the water there was something in the water
[8509.32s -> 8513.64s]  i'm gonna break through the wall this is way too close for there not to be something smashed
[8513.64s -> 8552.14s]  through this this is like bloodborne my eyes are so watery i don't think i've blinked the king's
[8552.14s -> 8559.86s]  orders the kids stop israel free palestine just gave 10 community subs thanks for the community
[8559.86s -> 8578.28s]  subs thank you for those subs oh well the king's orders finally arrived withdraw it is most vexing
[8578.28s -> 8583.66s]  that we must abandon the border stronghold to those heretics if i had but a little more time i
[8583.66s -> 8588.81s]  know i might be able to turn the tides of this battle uh nay i should not put on air as it is
[8588.81s -> 8601.35s]  my curiosity that ties me to this place nice accent i'm not putting on an accent everybody
[8601.35s -> 8622.55s]  you just got political i know we gotta play resident evil so what rule number two that's
[8622.55s -> 8628.95s]  it's not it's just a lot of crazy shit going on in the world right now a lot of crazy shit going
[8628.95s -> 8642.30s]  on in the world right now so i don't know about you guys but i use this this place here as i can
[8642.30s -> 8653.30s]  escape from myself the world is fucking crazy right now this is my place to have fun and kind
[8653.30s -> 8662.41s]  of forget about it if i'm completely honest it's a it's a way to just kind of enjoy what's going
[8662.41s -> 8671.22s]  on here right now um and we don't really talk about very many things on this stream and that's
[8671.22s -> 8679.82s]  because i don't want to because what i want to do here is take myself away from that kind of stuff
[8680.70s -> 8691.08s]  i want to take myself away from it and enjoy this we make little jokes you've heard me do
[8691.08s -> 8696.60s]  like fucking trump impressions and we talked about like joe biden is gonna watch bionicle with you
[8696.60s -> 8702.84s]  but like i think that's just like little dumb shit that we do sometimes but this place is for
[8702.92s -> 8707.08s]  me just to come fuck around and forget about the wild fucking crazy world we actually live in
[8710.98s -> 8716.86s]  so if you want opinions of mine on things you're probably not going to get them here
[8719.54s -> 8728.07s]  81 fov was way more contentious than to you because that's this place here right now
[8736.44s -> 8743.06s]  i use streaming and just fucking around with you guys as a way to just kind of forget about
[8743.06s -> 8747.22s]  shit and escape from the goddamn crazy world we're in and i kind of want to keep it that way
[8748.50s -> 8763.13s]  so there you go 70 fov is too much with that we're going to continue and play resident evil
[8763.13s -> 8773.26s]  you don't got to explain yourself no but i mean so i mean sometimes i do because the world is so
[8773.26s -> 8781.58s]  crazy that you know it's it's stuff just shit look at the look at the last year it's hard to
[8781.58s -> 8790.25s]  ignore the last year of crazy shit we had like a we had a covet 19 coronavirus that like shut the
[8790.25s -> 8798.36s]  whole world down it's hard to like escape from that but you know i try you still owe us a left
[8798.36s -> 8814.38s]  for dead stream you lost one k of viewers while saying saying what oh what did i say you can be
[8814.38s -> 8825.06s]  emotionally taxing it can and i don't don't get me wrong do not twist the statements i'm gonna
[8825.06s -> 8830.42s]  that i've been making here i put a lot of private thought and a lot of personal thought into tons
[8830.42s -> 8837.85s]  of stuff going on in the world this is this is like my place to come escape and have fun
[8837.85s -> 8856.49s]  that's all i'm gonna say let's continue anyways here we go save the game did i get the fourth one
[8856.49s -> 8864.30s]  no you should try taking lsd why would i take lsd i don't you i don't want to take drugs
[8867.66s -> 8870.78s]  the way that i like see the world and the way that like my brain works up here
[8871.74s -> 8876.54s]  i think i would literally i would probably start to fly like i but maybe i would i would
[8876.78s -> 8883.83s]  i don't know i would go crazy i would freak out if i took hard drugs you want a tldr lore statement
[8883.83s -> 8889.94s]  here i've never taken hard drugs in my life ever not one time ever i've drank alcohol and i've
[8889.94s -> 8895.14s]  smoked weed and didn't consume marijuana products right okay right like your grandmother does that
[8895.14s -> 8899.54s]  shit too i've never had hard drugs before in my whole life and they terrify me because i don't
[8899.54s -> 8904.97s]  know what i would happen if i took them like if i ever like experimented with like a hard drug
[8905.78s -> 8911.30s]  i swear to god i would like i would like end up somewhere like i would end up like on another
[8911.30s -> 8932.89s]  planet or something and it would freak me out no way i can't do it all right engage oh it's this
[8932.89s -> 8953.74s]  guy from the very beginning of the game all right let's get some wait wait ready any mines all right

[9079.77s -> 9107.24s]  i swear to god i want the focus area to be up here wouldn't you think that this would be like
[9107.24s -> 9115.27s]  far away and this is like coming like well how come i can't get it but i'm trying to the other
[9115.27s -> 9122.41s]  way make it turn it down i'm trying to make the background blurry in his face it's not even like

[9614.89s -> 9632.01s]  my cheeks with air and then expelling it quickly babies babies i believe this is a shortcut of some
[9632.01s -> 9644.33s]  sort so it's cool that there is a shortcut system in this game but what the hell for what what is
[9644.33s -> 9660.68s]  this for like for what this doesn't really do anything because i mean i guess i could go sell
[9660.68s -> 9679.50s]  and craft again before continuing but do i really care to do that i guess they're gonna give it to
[9679.50s -> 9695.62s]  me might as well from here i need to go straight down i can't i missed a shiny you have about
[9695.62s -> 9710.04s]  three hours left it's exactly what i thought too where's the shiny it's precisely what i thought
[9710.04s -> 9720.34s]  too all right what's the fastest way for me to get i probably need to go this way yeah just go

[9775.32s -> 9783.90s]  i can't do it why is it doing that though it doesn't sound right this one's is yesterday
[9783.90s -> 9791.45s]  it was i did this and i did the same knob so i did this same knob yesterday and now it's a
[9791.45s -> 9799.70s]  different sound coming out of it i don't know why don't ask me why but the idea was i was gonna go

[13972.17s -> 13981.30s]  you spent 20 well i bro i spent like about maybe 12 hours at the first village part this is about
[13981.30s -> 13989.27s]  what 29 27 hours of game time i'm a completionist i do like 100 of every game essentially
[13990.50s -> 13995.94s]  um i'm kind of like people have called me uh the wizard from the wizard from vegas you know
[13995.94s -> 14001.62s]  because like i i get in i figure out everything and i i just figured out all the completion
[14001.62s -> 14007.42s]  routes and i try to get everything as fast as i can 100 they call me the game the game wizard
[14007.42s -> 14021.86s]  from las vegas is what i've been called before all the new people here oh god like if there's
[14021.86s -> 14034.52s]  something to figure out in the game you know i'll find it all right well that's a shortcut back to
[14034.52s -> 14060.41s]  there uh can we go can we jot that down for the uh for the vod the time stamp here because i want
[14060.41s -> 14065.70s]  to make sure i put that in the video like a thing that i found for the completion of stuff so this
[14065.70s -> 14109.56s]  is how you get to the mechanical part cylinder everybody just said shut up on me okay it's taking
[14109.56s -> 14123.86s]  a good mental picture of exactly the layout of this map so i can remember it 100 of it i really
[14123.86s -> 14138.44s]  don't want to okay here's this part remember this is so obscure everyone's gonna think you're a
[14138.44s -> 14149.62s]  fucking weirdo what are you talking about why would you say something so weird you're like scaring
[14149.62s -> 14155.06s]  people off fully grown male corpse used remove heart and implanted kadoo muscle stimulation
[14155.06s -> 14161.30s]  via electric shock was successful brain dead so no high cognitive ability only moves by destructive
[14161.30s -> 14169.30s]  instinct then stops attached headgear to the cranium electrodes confirm stable brain waves
[14170.26s -> 14178.17s]  everyone lichen fight was dismantled and eaten within three minutes mechanical soldier soul sold
[14178.17s -> 14183.77s]  that replace lower part of the arm with drill not enough output for effective movement need live
[14183.77s -> 14192.25s]  bodies perhaps implanted kadoo reactor into the chest output greatly increased lichen fight
[14192.25s -> 14197.86s]  destroy three lichens in one minute results with issues with reactive durability may stop
[14197.86s -> 14211.82s]  functioning reactors destroyed okay hog mold we have to make it back to the car all right we're
[14211.82s -> 14219.27s]  gonna go back to the cog room which that might be really really no how am i hurt i'm like very
[14219.27s -> 14238.79s]  injured right now hog mold all right where where was that where is there a mold somewhere casting
[14238.79s -> 14245.03s]  okay there's the casting machine and then here's the switch casting machine i'll just gotta go
[14245.03s -> 14252.36s]  straight through here comes up here they're gonna all wake up one two three go it's gonna go oh i
[14252.36s -> 14304.73s]  told you ah what that didn't hit why they're getting this close to him nice i just mortal
[14304.73s -> 14329.05s]  combat default beat that guy cog now where was there a cog is there some other door that i didn't
[14329.05s -> 14379.35s]  see there's a cog door somewhere i have no idea where hog door um kind of kind of lost did you
[14379.35s -> 14420.22s]  unlock the sigma dick door no not yet is it this thing no objective terminate jeremy who's that

[14442.42s -> 14476.98s]  gaming wizard yeah uh yeah i'm kind of lost those are gaming wizard strats yeah turning off those
[14476.98s -> 14504.25s]  things for no reason there's the map there's nothing on the only two things on the map this
[14504.25s -> 14520.86s]  is a switch right here and then there's the mold is it this way no i don't know use the mold
[14520.86s -> 14536.36s]  what no i already i got the large cog can we can we get a wizard diaper check please
[14536.36s -> 14553.86s]  um sure yeah i think it should be okay this is i don't have to take a break yet is it up here
[14553.86s -> 14575.99s]  i forget not in here is it where is this place i really don't know it's not this right this is a
[14575.99s -> 14583.11s]  switch but should i just go see if i can click a switch that's a reused bad joke that's a reused
[14583.11s -> 14614.84s]  really bad joke t on the map lift controls that's b3 mb3 mb4 i just don't know where to go
[14614.84s -> 14620.39s]  i don't remember the backup generator yeah but that that could have that honestly that could have
[14620.39s -> 14629.18s]  been like three or four years ago generator level okay i need to go b4 so where am i right now
[14629.82s -> 14642.46s]  i'm on mb4 i need to go to b4 it's in the dark room the drill guy came from i was just in there
[14642.46s -> 14672.90s]  wasn't i not enough power okay is it just like here somewhere dude just play among us down the
[14672.90s -> 14691.02s]  stairs in the second drill room is the backup generator next to the drill guys like the time
[14691.02s -> 14703.88s]  where they're all on the wall is your brain check the map is this why the person said this place
[14703.88s -> 14708.12s]  sucked they said i really hated this place but like i'll watch you play it this is why
[14717.22s -> 14721.30s]  where are those you said the guys that are on the wall i don't even care if you backseat
[14721.30s -> 14727.00s]  for this part i really don't i don't give you backseat a lot of time actually it's right there
[14727.00s -> 14733.78s]  yes probably near where that secret door you blow up with the pipe bomb i don't i don't even i have
[14733.78s -> 14740.46s]  no idea adjacent to the mold room i don't even know what that is generator sus guy lost another
[14740.54s -> 14748.46s]  concrete building back in the mold room through the door behind the table behind the table behind
[14748.46s -> 14767.83s]  the table behind the table engine room this is why like i hate when there's like three four five
[14767.83s -> 14774.84s]  levels like up and down it just confuses the absolute hell out of me i don't even like
[14774.84s -> 14781.96s]  understand like i did what where i need to go i did like so long ago in my brain i don't even
[14781.96s -> 14807.45s]  remember being there blue hallway top of foundry like here okay blue hallway they don't have this
[14807.45s -> 14825.08s]  key yeah i just ran past it what the hall with the hang drill guys take a right to the generator
[14825.08s -> 14846.20s]  and use the cog okay take a right and use the cog here's the guys with the fucking wall here
[14846.28s -> 14856.84s]  like through here cog jeremy the cog the vent left no left i can't go left i can't go left
[14860.97s -> 14871.98s]  stop moving for a second okay left at the clown this is your brain on drugs no this is your brain
[14871.98s -> 14877.18s]  on let's keep backtracking in all of our games because people remember how much they hated this
[14877.18s -> 14906.47s]  shit so let's do it a different way this time no in here in here down here the cog is an admin
[14906.47s -> 14920.86s]  i walked by it i'm getting i am getting fucked with even this goddamn factory map stop at the
[14920.86s -> 14929.93s]  mold door okay here's the the room you guys telling me to go to stop at the mold door
[14933.46s -> 14969.64s]  just before the stairs in the guy divot drill guy down here yeah this place sucks i don't like
[14969.64s -> 14974.60s]  this place you move back to like the big swamp where like i could see everything
[14975.61s -> 14981.82s]  such a disappointment i thought we could join forces against that
[14981.82s -> 14993.37s]  bitch miranda concrete rant yes it is disappointing like every wall looks like
[14993.37s -> 15026.65s]  i'm inside of a goddamn motherboard i can't even pay attention
[15026.89s -> 15039.30s]  me
[15059.00s -> 15063.80s]  i'm half paying attention to our conversation i don't even know what you just said but i'm going
[15063.80s -> 15073.70s]  to give some kind of reply to make it seem like you think i was listening wow holy shit

[15139.67s -> 15144.10s]  a little bit of inflection at the end if there's like a the voice raises a little bit
[15144.82s -> 15176.41s]  you say oh my god what else is in here oh i found you he's gonna go through the ground
[15177.05s -> 15195.08s]  no they got me in a pickle shit i just got caught in second base i'm still alive right fight each

[15295.88s -> 15317.69s]  completely out of ammo i'm gonna have to start sorry hit me with a knife all right i need to make
[15317.69s -> 15330.18s]  i need shocking ammo yep and you're not even halfway through the level oh that's not good
[15332.10s -> 15357.91s]  that sucks what's this why is this in here that guy's gonna wake up wait can i just shoot him in
[15357.91s -> 15387.58s]  the heart right now i don't know why i didn't think he could get through that there was no way
[15387.58s -> 15405.80s]  he could get through that in my brain i don't know why i was like i thought it was safe so now
[15406.52s -> 15424.97s]  get no ammo i gotta pee again too that's not good anything what's my actual goal right now
[15425.53s -> 15440.38s]  i mean like what's what's my goal escape the factory i guess but i guess where does that mean
[15441.85s -> 15475.98s]  this vibe okay what's that i go that way you're getting lost again yeah probably
[15476.70s -> 15488.68s]  i'm back in this room um i have to open this door by pressing some kind of button
[15489.40s -> 15501.37s]  germa germa germa please fart i mean there's definitely something i have to activate over
[15501.37s -> 15520.73s]  here i'll take it why did i go backwards i it this is a this is a really confusing area
[15521.53s -> 15529.61s]  i'm not trying to go backwards uh just every backwards is forwards in my brain
[15530.94s -> 15536.38s]  everything looks exactly the same it's more like the concrete like fucking concrete metal
[15536.38s -> 15541.62s]  fucking walls and shit a bunch of like machinery in the middle like every room is machinery in the
[15541.62s -> 15570.10s]  middle with concrete and steel all right i remember this did i go this way i mean i killed
[15570.10s -> 15593.27s]  everything here i'm gonna go back up the stairs and you notice it's like the spatial shit too
[15593.27s -> 15599.16s]  it's like everything's just this this i can't see anything it's just every this somebody said it
[15599.16s -> 15610.41s]  everything just looks exactly the same like put some fucking balloons and shit like what i put
[15610.41s -> 15617.40s]  some fucking statues or something so i can know oh i have this i remember the balloon room
[15617.96s -> 15639.50s]  this guy's got two wait he's not his heart's not showing why it's in his head is it in this

[15679.08s -> 15702.55s]  goodness trusty shotgun power use the map if you're getting lost my problem with the map is just it
[15703.19s -> 15709.27s]  it's just like tetris pieces like you know what i mean it's just like oh this is just
[15709.91s -> 15713.43s]  i guess that's just a hallway that doesn't show all the machinery and shit there's no balloons
[15714.07s -> 15732.02s]  he hates tetris and capcom yeah i'm only playing this game out of spite because every time we turn
[15732.02s -> 15737.88s]  the corner we're gonna make fun of it like oh scary this is what we do in this channel we pick
[15737.88s -> 15742.70s]  like the fucking games and companies we think is stupid and like oh yeah we were like pretend like
[15742.70s -> 15749.02s]  oh look at me i'm playing through this shitty game right it's wicked funny oh look out the guy with

[16336.70s -> 16343.35s]  you watch somebody play a game like this or if you want even like a friend of yours you there's
[16343.35s -> 16348.23s]  something about watching somebody playing a scary game and startling things versus actually doing
[16348.23s -> 16355.19s]  it yourself because like i've watched friends of mine play scary games and they they go they scream
[16355.19s -> 16358.71s]  and i'm just like i i'm sitting here watching you they why why are you so scared that wasn't
[16358.71s -> 16364.66s]  that scary that's really that was your reaction but when you're actually like locked into the
[16364.66s -> 16371.59s]  matrix it it's a lot different when it's you being attacked because this is an extension of me someone
[16371.59s -> 16375.99s]  just attacked me i sitting on the couch and watching somebody just get attacked it's not even
[16375.99s -> 16382.01s]  it's not me like you are you might have the first person perspective but you are watching me get
[16382.01s -> 16387.67s]  attacked you're like from a distance but like pretty much you're like 50 feet away that's why
[16387.67s -> 16411.45s]  is that true dude you get really immersed when you play it yourself yes and this is a circle this is
[16411.45s -> 16421.13s]  the square this is a rectangle look i mean it's basic all right whatever it's been all right that
[16421.13s -> 16446.78s]  was pretty basic but you know what i mean it that's true though yellow quartz large crystal
[16447.80s -> 16462.66s]  large crystal oh finally some money so low on ammo it's crazy more explosive rounds more
[16463.54s -> 16480.66s]  turn off your light nope more more more my favorite part of all the movies everybody thinks no just
[16480.66s -> 16485.54s]  when darth vader and luke like me no mine's more that's my favorite part of every single star wars

[18319.22s -> 18331.75s]  so if i increase this capacity i will get 14 shots worth doing ah it's fine all finished
[18331.75s -> 18348.30s]  our leave this to me i'm gonna do power to do power on this too for ammo capacity
[18354.12s -> 18363.48s]  this simple modification can be done in just a moment good day then
[18364.44s -> 18383.56s]  okay 14 all right i'm going to switch this to flash banks and use them
[18384.12s -> 18392.36s]  because why not our saves ammo it's better than capacity you know that is actually probably true
[18395.83s -> 18403.42s]  all right now we have to go up open that other door and i i'm assuming this is probably one of
[18403.42s -> 18419.85s]  the major fights of the whole game or damage you do less ammo you use that's right as long as i hit
[18419.85s -> 18434.50s]  my shots well i've got about 13 or 14 magnum shots to make let's hope i make them two heals

[19115.64s -> 19121.24s]  i was just lucky i had more affinity to the stuff than the other poor schmucks in the village so
[19121.24s -> 19126.52s]  she still calls me her son what a joke i'll never forgive what she did to me that crazy bitch has
[19126.60s -> 19131.24s]  never been right in the head she can't see a difference between experiment and family

[19137.34s -> 19143.42s]  never be my own still she may be crazy but she's also powerful she can turn into anyone using the
[19143.42s -> 19152.47s]  mega me site the trick is that brat rose if i could access her power then maybe speaking of
[19152.47s -> 19156.71s]  the kid's dad Ethan has a pretty interesting body himself maybe i could get him to help me out

[19429.74s -> 19439.96s]  it was miranda what she's a bio weapon she changed her appearance and pretended to be mia
[19439.96s -> 19442.92s]  seems she also survived new shots so now i'm here to finish the job
[19444.23s -> 19449.75s]  bullshit why don't you fucking tell me right away because i knew you would want to be involved
[19450.55s -> 19456.41s]  this job is hard enough without civilians getting in the way yeah which will get
[19457.05s -> 19460.73s]  chris files will you play like his side of the story what the hell is going on
[19460.73s -> 19491.13s]  dlc i guess i owe you an explanation hand me that wrench long story short miranda's fucking insane
[19492.09s -> 19496.25s]  this village all these monsters and freaks this is their life's work
[19497.21s -> 19507.32s]  some sort of crazy experiment with the mold like louisiana god damn it all this time
[19507.32s -> 19516.57s]  i thought i could save my family i can't escape from here i can't do anything that might not be
[19516.57s -> 19526.60s]  true take a look at this my men sent those pictures a few minutes ago miranda keep looking
[19529.66s -> 19534.46s]  don't go too far though don't go too far oh shit we gotta go relax my men are monitoring the
[19534.46s -> 19539.74s]  situation but they have my daughter and it looked good last saturday don't go more than five
[19542.38s -> 19549.74s]  that's the most nerve-wracking thing ever when somebody has your phone down here and finish
[19549.74s -> 19554.22s]  planting explosives you take that elevator i'll meet you topside when you say hey look at this
[19554.22s -> 19561.66s]  picture and they go oh cool yeah and they swipe and they swipe and i don't do that

[19565.88s -> 19570.60s]  photo you don't need to i don't want to show you anything else all right ethan you take this
[19571.48s -> 19583.21s]  and do me a favor try to stay under the radar why does he have like a wesker look-alike costume on
[19595.42s -> 19599.02s]  owned wolf squad the sweep of the factory is complete no proof of any connection with the
[19599.02s -> 19604.62s]  organization guess this was just wasn't our day uh i did manage to get my hands on a number of
[19604.62s -> 19607.90s]  documents disclosing some of miranda's experiments which support our previous theories
[19608.62s -> 19613.50s]  she seems to have infected herself with the muta mesite which grants her a number of abilities
[19613.50s -> 19619.29s]  including mimic mimicry she can control herself and transform herself to look like anyone or
[19619.29s -> 19625.43s]  anything so that could have just been her she disguised herself as mia and infiltrated the
[19625.43s -> 19631.22s]  winter's home her objective was to kidnap rose maybe she thought she could control rose easier
[19631.22s -> 19636.90s]  if she looked like her mom when we attacked it put a little damper on her plan so she
[19636.90s -> 19643.85s]  mimicked a corpse but is she the guy that's been lying around remember the guy that i keep saying
[19643.93s -> 19652.33s]  like hey this guy's like in every scene why is he lying down on the ground is that her she then
[19652.33s -> 19657.13s]  revived herself from the transport truck killed everyone on board and took off with rose things
[19657.13s -> 19660.49s]  didn't go the way she had originally planned but in the end she still got what she wanted
[19661.37s -> 19667.13s]  till now it's time to rendezvous and blow this place sky high this might turn into a fight with
[19667.13s -> 19673.85s]  heisenberg but i think i found something useful he left one of his little toys laying around and
[19673.85s -> 19679.21s]  it's even made from a metal polymer composite we can't control time to turn the tables
[19681.56s -> 19688.65s]  tank fight got ourselves a tank fight uh this shit in here i don't want to leave without it
[19694.66s -> 19712.25s]  maybe this will save me some ammo okay let's go save the game i have to hold this for this long
[19715.22s -> 19723.14s]  it was a really long hold metal polymer composite huh time to fight fire with fire

[20368.84s -> 20383.10s]  careless yesterday we took down the transformed miranda but we didn't kill her since miranda
[20383.10s -> 20391.69s]  could have infected ethan i forcefully took him and rose with us but the vehicle they were
[20391.69s -> 20399.82s]  riding in was attacked when i got to the wreck ethan and rose were gone that's not an ending
[20400.54s -> 20406.49s]  the last time i was able to contact ethan that's not the end of the game i heard miranda's voice

[21373.53s -> 21377.21s]  a moldy little bird told her maybe we can figure that out later
[21377.85s -> 21385.74s]  focus on the plan i found it it's the megamycete
[21387.96s -> 21404.55s]  crank turtles i killed this the best tigger impression i've located the megamycete
[21405.27s -> 21421.21s]  so now we can end this mess after all about damn time and two explosives armed there's enough

[21437.22s -> 21444.17s]  keep your distance do not move until i give the order i know it's too late now but we really
[21444.17s -> 21449.85s]  should have told ethan the plan there wasn't time we didn't expect miranda to act so soon
[21450.81s -> 21468.46s]  even so you should have told him yeah and two explosives i guess it was no time
[21468.46s -> 21471.82s]  yeah i think there was time when we were sitting in the garage working as buddies
[21472.54s -> 21494.39s]  on a father-son tractor project i feel like you had a little bit of time to tell me oh here we go
[21495.11s -> 21510.84s]  the final save point before the final boss i know it you know it we all know it this mermaid
[21513.11s -> 21522.81s]  got in it uh subject salvator moro has caused drastic changes to internal organs
[21523.37s -> 21528.39s]  transforming them into organs similar to fish like gills and a swim bladder another subject
[21528.39s -> 21532.39s]  with a regular cell division caused him to transform into giant fish subject is unable
[21532.39s -> 21547.14s]  to control this transformation too many defects an unfit vessel for eva alcenia dimitresu dimitresu
[21547.14s -> 21551.82s]  there it is most favorable brain function normal regeneration rate is incredibly fast
[21552.71s -> 21557.10s]  subject can heal any external wound within seconds and grow her nails into claws in
[21557.10s -> 21562.70s]  mere moments of rapid regeneration also means an increased body size due to hereditary blood
[21562.70s -> 21566.46s]  disease the subject must ingest human flesh and blood on a regular basis to maintain regeneration
[21566.46s -> 21571.02s]  properties i suspect that if the subject's regeneration is not properly balanced then
[21571.02s -> 21579.50s]  she may mutate uncontrollably okay well that's lady dimitresu and then we've got of course
[21581.06s -> 21586.97s]  karl heisenberg has electric organs similar to that of an electric ray

[21688.54s -> 21693.66s]  when i strayed stayed in your village i was inspired by your research to think one could
[21693.66s -> 21699.26s]  transform a human by infecting them with an organism positively visionary i know that with
[21699.26s -> 21703.34s]  that knowledge i could achieve my own vision for the next step in human evolution even after the
[21703.34s -> 21708.46s]  two world wars and humanity on the cusp of another than my conviction never way i stopped putting
[21708.46s -> 21714.57s]  this on i'm like just locked in like a train of thought too much on i realized however through
[21715.13s -> 21719.45s]  the many nights of intellectual talks you and i shared that your conviction differed from mine
[21719.45s -> 21725.26s]  you hope to bring back a single dead person while i aim to change the world your experiments on the
[21725.26s -> 21730.86s]  mold would not have aided me in my endeavor to achieve an exponential infection but a virus
[21730.86s -> 21736.38s]  would be more effective this is why my dear i had to leave you still regret never telling you goodbye

[23877.86s -> 23882.02s]  gonna be like three or four pixels forward or something but i'm not gonna throw up playing the
[23882.02s -> 23887.62s]  game i don't like i don't i it's i just want to play the fucking game and not want to throw up
[23888.34s -> 23904.46s]  it was an 8.7 it turned into 8.4 they do that because they they designed the game around
[23905.26s -> 23909.10s]  oh you we don't want you to see shit you're not supposed to see and it has the best experience
[23909.10s -> 23918.10s]  all the scares all the jump scares i i know but it was in the last fucking game in resident evil
[23918.10s -> 23922.34s]  seven though you could it was you could make 90 fov in resident evil seven what happened what's
[23922.34s -> 23929.21s]  the difference it's the same it's literally the sequel to the last game where where where
[23931.22s -> 23942.28s]  anyways now it was really good it was really really fun i like the kind of like treasures
[23942.28s -> 23948.20s]  that they put on the map i thought that was a huge um i thought that was a nice touch it's cool
[23948.20s -> 23950.68s]  they're like well wait what's over there i'm gonna go over there i'm gonna get that treasure
[23951.32s -> 23958.28s]  i did i missed a bunch of shit was it scary that was very scary i think this was scarier than seven
[23958.76s -> 23968.18s]  i buy a lot the first like two hours of seven was really scary really kind of intense but i
[23968.18s -> 23973.18s]  thought this one was like i the the weird baby chapter freaked me the fuck out it really did
[23974.81s -> 23980.28s]  i would say the first two to three hours of resident evil seven was scarier than a majority
[23980.28s -> 23985.40s]  of the shit in this game but i kind of just liked i would play it out in this one a little better
[23985.40s -> 23994.95s]  resident evil seven was like actually like a more creepy scary video game
[23995.58s -> 24004.86s]  resident evil eight is like just like jumpy very jumpy and i guess depending on how you decide
[24004.86s -> 24011.75s]  what you like more as a scary game i guess just more of like a fairy tale yeah i if i would
[24011.75s -> 24019.98s]  choose which game i liked more i don't know man like resident evil seven's last like four or five
[24019.98s -> 24028.62s]  hours i just it was a slog to me that boat sequence in resident evil seven was the ultimate slog and
[24028.62s -> 24038.89s]  it brought the whole fucking game down the whole game came down i did not have i was a little
[24038.89s -> 24044.33s]  irritated in some points in the game but no point in this game did i feel like that boat level
[24044.33s -> 24050.82s]  were you just like shooting machine guns into enemies i mean except for that chris ending
[24050.82s -> 24055.54s]  i think as a whole i think eight's a better game i think seven the first few hours is scarier and
[24055.54s -> 24072.28s]  more interesting but i think eight's probably a better game yeah seven's definitely seven setting
[24072.28s -> 24075.72s]  was probably a little more interesting i don't know just sound about like a weird scary family
[24075.72s -> 24080.06s]  chasing around a house and shit it's like weird and terrifying but then they got rid of that and
[24080.06s -> 24088.94s]  then they moved on to like the boat shit bone in or boneless wings well boneless because i'd like
[24088.94s -> 24098.57s]  to just dunk them in sauce and just drain them what about the heisenberg parking garage segment
[24100.79s -> 24106.38s]  yeah but once i started to feel kind of annoyed and frustrated in that area and how much of that
[24106.38s -> 24113.27s]  is my like adhd inability to pay attention to like certain environments um i still don't think i was
[24113.35s -> 24122.18s]  i really just thought the boat sequence was just terrible so they're both really good games they're
[24122.18s -> 24155.66s]  both like great okay let's see what happens here we have an ending sequence we do do you think the
[24155.66s -> 24161.34s]  little boy will be able to touch the moon nobody can touch the moon it's too far away wait what if
[24161.34s -> 24170.33s]  he has a rocket ship uh okay then you can touch your butt it'd be very very cool he's going to
