[0.31s -> 12.20s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Welcome back to Hitman Absolution.
[12.20s -> 15.70s]  If you're just joining us, if you've never seen an episode before, then hello.
[15.70s -> 22.20s]  Welcome to an episode of Hitman Absolution. I suggest you go back and watch the first four or five episodes.
[22.20s -> 26.70s]  I think there's four right now. But let's get started here, escaping the library.
[26.70s -> 33.55s]  Gotta get rid of all these coppers, or at least avoid these coppers. Let's see here.
[33.55s -> 39.55s]  I actually do remember this from the gameplay demo they did a long time ago.
[39.55s -> 43.55s]  But I don't remember exactly how to do this, so we'll see how this goes.
[43.55s -> 48.33s]  Okay, what am I doing here?
[48.33s -> 50.83s]  Get out! Why are these guys still standing here?
[50.83s -> 54.15s]  Going like a coffee break. Get the hell out of here.
[54.15s -> 57.65s]  I'm gonna drop a chandelier on your head.
[57.65s -> 61.11s]  Now they're starting to move. Good, good, good.
[61.11s -> 63.61s]  Should be able just to chill out somewhere.
[63.61s -> 66.12s]  Right here seems good.
[66.12s -> 68.43s]  Only one dude.
[68.43s -> 71.95s]  Two guys over there, though.
[71.95s -> 75.62s]  Scaring me.
[75.62s -> 77.86s]  Maybe I can just go now? Let's go now.
[77.86s -> 80.36s]  No, not now, not now. Wow.
[80.36s -> 85.98s]  Wow, I almost just got spotted right there.
[85.98s -> 89.50s]  How do I do? How am I supposed to just go?
[89.50s -> 93.88s]  Hey, go like on patrol somewhere. Get the hell out of here.
[93.88s -> 96.64s]  You prick, get away from me.
[96.64s -> 99.98s]  Here we go, he's leaving.
[99.98s -> 104.12s]  Yeah, turn your back for two seconds and I'm out of here.
[104.12s -> 108.08s]  Maybe not, he almost just saw me. What's that?
[108.08s -> 111.46s]  Check over there. I got it.
[111.46s -> 113.46s]  Uh, there's a point of interest over here.
[113.46s -> 119.34s]  Wow, don't move.
[119.84s -> 122.98s]  I'm gonna try and make my way over there.
[122.98s -> 127.46s]  I don't really feel like going over here.
[127.46s -> 129.46s]  Let's see, can I make it over here?
[129.46s -> 131.46s]  Without being spotted is the real question.
[131.46s -> 134.22s]  Kind of.
[134.22s -> 136.22s]  But I don't like being in this position.
[136.22s -> 138.72s]  I don't like being in this position at all.
[138.72s -> 141.67s]  These guys have to move.
[141.67s -> 144.94s]  These guys have to move right now.
[144.94s -> 148.80s]  Right now.
[148.80s -> 150.80s]  Oh, these... I don't know where to go.
[150.80s -> 152.80s]  Don't stand up, that would be a bad idea.
[152.80s -> 156.26s]  Let me just stand up real quick. Hi.
[156.26s -> 158.25s]  I wonder if I can still...
[158.25s -> 160.90s]  Now where's he going?
[160.90s -> 163.65s]  Go over there. Damn it.
[163.65s -> 169.08s]  Ah, maybe I can walk around this way?
[169.08s -> 171.58s]  Is there anybody over here? No, this is not okay.
[171.58s -> 175.93s]  Point shooting? I don't know how to do point shooting.
[175.93s -> 177.93s]  Ooh, release light rig.
[177.93s -> 182.41s]  Can I grab this without him seeing?
[182.41s -> 186.61s]  I don't know if I can. I'm gonna be spotted if I walk over here.
[186.61s -> 190.50s]  Do I have like a distraction thing? Like a bottle or something?
[190.50s -> 193.78s]  Maybe he won't see me.
[193.78s -> 197.62s]  Oh, he didn't see... Oh my god.
[197.62s -> 199.94s]  Oh my god.
[199.94s -> 202.72s]  Oh my word.
[202.72s -> 203.72s]  Where are they going?
[203.72s -> 208.50s]  This one guy's coming over here right now.
[208.50s -> 209.50s]  Does he have any idea what's...
[209.50s -> 211.24s]  Did I go behind him?
[211.24s -> 215.45s]  Holy crap.
[215.45s -> 219.43s]  Holy crap.
[219.43s -> 220.93s]  What's that guy just standing there for?
[220.93s -> 222.43s]  Get out of here, man. Don't just stand there.
[222.43s -> 225.12s]  Holy. Holy hell. Holy hell.
[225.12s -> 226.12s]  This guy's coming over here right now.
[226.12s -> 228.12s]  Holy hand grenade. Holy hell.
[228.12s -> 229.62s]  Don't see me.
[229.62s -> 234.48s]  Do you know what, man?
[234.48s -> 237.94s]  No, that's not what I wanted to do.
[240.20s -> 244.10s]  This is ridiculous.
[244.10s -> 249.58s]  How on earth is a hiding place right here?
[249.58s -> 260.87s]  Can I subdue this guy without this one seeing?
[260.87s -> 261.87s]  This guy's gotta move.
[261.87s -> 265.94s]  Okay, here we go.
[265.94s -> 266.94s]  Moment of truth.
[266.94s -> 267.94s]  Moment of truth.
[267.94s -> 269.30s]  Moment of truth.
[271.90s -> 273.27s]  Moment of truth.
[273.27s -> 275.44s]  Where we go, boys?
[275.44s -> 276.44s]  And or girls?
[276.44s -> 281.89s]  Come here.
[281.89s -> 282.89s]  Come here, you.
[282.89s -> 285.09s]  Get back here.
[285.09s -> 286.09s]  Get back here.
[286.09s -> 288.16s]  Get back here.
[288.16s -> 289.16s]  And nobody is the wiser.
[289.16s -> 292.04s]  Give me your police disguise.
[292.04s -> 295.42s]  And then you're going in here.
[295.42s -> 296.42s]  I'm sorry.
[296.42s -> 298.60s]  It was a necessary thing I had to do.
[298.60s -> 301.54s]  The lights are all on.
[304.32s -> 307.80s]  All right.
[307.80s -> 311.64s]  I should probably pick up his gun.
[311.64s -> 313.64s]  What's Johnson's gun doing on the ground?
[313.64s -> 319.97s]  I don't know. I have no idea.
[319.97s -> 321.97s]  Something tells me I don't want to just walk by this guy.
[321.97s -> 322.97s]  That would be a terrible idea.
[322.97s -> 323.97s]  Let's go back the other way.
[323.97s -> 325.21s]  Actually, you know what?
[325.21s -> 326.21s]  Can I go up top?
[326.21s -> 329.74s]  Would be probably a better decision.
[329.74s -> 333.24s]  The lights are all just blaring right now.
[333.24s -> 337.62s]  Probably should.
[337.62s -> 338.62s]  Holy crap.
[338.62s -> 343.75s]  That's another officer.
[343.75s -> 344.75s]  Why are you looking at the book?
[344.75s -> 347.50s]  Why are you looking at the bookcases?
[347.50s -> 350.50s]  This guy's looking for me in the bookcases.
[350.50s -> 352.74s]  Like he's looking at the books.
[352.74s -> 354.74s]  I wonder, he might be inside of the books.
[354.74s -> 355.74s]  He never can be too careful.
[355.74s -> 361.42s]  This guy keeps on looking over here.
[361.42s -> 362.42s]  And you know what?
[362.42s -> 363.42s]  I am going to go back down.
[363.42s -> 365.42s]  I'm going to go break those lights.
[365.42s -> 373.15s]  I remember seeing that one guy here.
[373.15s -> 377.94s]  I should be able to get behind him.
[377.94s -> 378.94s]  No, I don't even need to do that.
[378.94s -> 380.44s]  I can probably just, you know what?
[380.44s -> 384.88s]  I can probably just stand up and fake my way around.
[384.88s -> 385.88s]  Put the gun away though.
[385.88s -> 388.84s]  Yep.
[388.84s -> 391.34s]  Let's move back this way into the darkness.
[391.34s -> 395.63s]  I might even want to just get rid of this guy.
[395.63s -> 396.63s]  Seriously.
[396.63s -> 397.87s]  Oh crap.
[397.87s -> 404.77s]  Let's try this again.
[404.77s -> 407.27s]  This time let's be a little bit more sneaky about it, please.
[407.27s -> 410.81s]  And thank you.
[410.81s -> 411.81s]  Back is turned.
[411.81s -> 413.31s]  That guy's back is also turned.
[413.31s -> 414.31s]  Can I climb through here?
[414.31s -> 415.31s]  No, I can't.
[415.31s -> 417.58s]  I broke it.
[417.58s -> 427.71s]  There we go.
[427.71s -> 430.10s]  There we go.
[430.10s -> 431.41s]  There we go.
[431.41s -> 432.58s]  Oh boy.
[432.58s -> 437.69s]  This guy's coming back this way?
[437.69s -> 439.50s]  Damn it.
[439.50s -> 440.50s]  Just hang out over there, dude.
[440.50s -> 441.50s]  Just hang out over there.
[441.50s -> 442.74s]  Be cool.
[442.74s -> 444.94s]  We'll all be cool.
[444.94s -> 448.46s]  These guys have seen me now.
[448.46s -> 449.46s]  I might just be able to walk by.
[449.46s -> 450.46s]  Let's see if I can just...
[450.46s -> 453.09s]  No, I got to crouch back underneath here.
[453.09s -> 454.09s]  Wait for this guy to walk.
[454.09s -> 455.09s]  Is he walking out?
[455.09s -> 456.09s]  Go out.
[456.09s -> 457.65s]  Go out and talk to your friend.
[457.65s -> 461.32s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[461.32s -> 462.32s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[462.32s -> 466.38s]  Sabotage the lights.
[466.38s -> 467.38s]  Nobody see me.
[467.38s -> 468.62s]  Yes.
[468.62s -> 469.62s]  Yes.
[469.62s -> 470.62s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[470.62s -> 475.82s]  No, don't look at me.
[475.82s -> 476.82s]  Don't look at me.
[476.82s -> 480.18s]  I'm a cop too.
[480.18s -> 483.53s]  Don't look at me.
[483.53s -> 484.53s]  Good.
[484.53s -> 485.53s]  Good.
[485.53s -> 488.05s]  So far so good.
[488.05s -> 489.05s]  I'm going to go up the stairs now.
[489.05s -> 491.81s]  Both backs turned.
[491.81s -> 492.81s]  Yep.
[492.81s -> 495.26s]  Let's go up the stairs.
[495.26s -> 496.26s]  I'm a cop.
[496.26s -> 497.26s]  Don't worry.
[497.26s -> 498.26s]  I'm a police officer.
[498.26s -> 501.17s]  Just doing my job.
[501.17s -> 502.17s]  Looking up here.
[502.17s -> 504.37s]  Wow.
[504.37s -> 507.66s]  How is this other guy?
[507.66s -> 508.66s]  Still looking back there.
[508.66s -> 511.11s]  Man, I can't go out there.
[511.11s -> 514.21s]  I can't go anywhere.
[514.21s -> 519.10s]  You bastards.
[519.10s -> 522.10s]  I need to throw this guy off the balcony.
[522.10s -> 527.09s]  He's just annoying the hell out of me.
[527.09s -> 530.29s]  It looks like I could go over that way.
[530.29s -> 535.56s]  This guy's still...
[535.56s -> 536.56s]  Can I...
[536.56s -> 537.56s]  Maybe if I crouch I can...
[537.56s -> 538.93s]  Maybe he won't see me if I do this.
[538.93s -> 540.68s]  No, okay.
[540.68s -> 542.68s]  I can be sneaky about this.
[542.68s -> 545.65s]  See ya.
[545.65s -> 548.02s]  Wouldn't want to be ya.
[548.02s -> 551.54s]  Let's make our way.
[551.54s -> 552.54s]  Holy damn it.
[552.54s -> 559.70s]  You think you'd survive that drop?
[559.70s -> 560.70s]  Don't worry about it.
[560.70s -> 561.70s]  Just keep a lookout.
[561.70s -> 563.70s]  I really don't think you would survive that drop.
[563.70s -> 564.70s]  Just get away from the ledge.
[564.70s -> 566.78s]  Good slip and die.
[566.78s -> 568.59s]  Pull this out.
[568.59s -> 569.59s]  No one's going to die.
[569.59s -> 570.77s]  Just...
[570.77s -> 571.77s]  Just keep your eyes open.
[571.77s -> 572.77s]  You're good slip and die.
[572.77s -> 575.67s]  All right.
[575.67s -> 578.67s]  I definitely am supposed to go down this way and drop down.
[578.67s -> 585.44s]  Thanks for telling me what to do.
[585.44s -> 591.26s]  This guy turns his back.
[591.26s -> 592.26s]  Go look in that hole again.
[592.26s -> 593.26s]  Didn't it look like cool?
[593.26s -> 595.63s]  Wasn't it like weird looking?
[595.63s -> 596.63s]  Go like tell me how it looks.
[596.63s -> 599.73s]  Nope.
[599.73s -> 601.10s]  Not yet.
[601.10s -> 603.10s]  Man, they don't really know how to play tricks on you in this game.
[603.10s -> 605.10s]  I would have just dropped down there and gotten instantly murdered.
[605.10s -> 617.00s]  There's no way I'm going to take out that guy unless he turns around and this guy's not looking.
[617.00s -> 618.00s]  You know what?
[618.00s -> 626.73s]  Maybe I can push him in there.
[626.73s -> 627.73s]  He fell in the hole.
[627.73s -> 628.73s]  Nice.
[628.73s -> 629.73s]  Good.
[629.73s -> 630.73s]  Good.
[630.73s -> 632.48s]  Grand.
[632.48s -> 633.48s]  Great.
[633.48s -> 634.48s]  Grand.
[634.48s -> 635.48s]  Wonderful.
[636.91s -> 639.82s]  Give me the hammer.
[639.82s -> 640.82s]  Don't lose it here.
[640.82s -> 641.82s]  Don't like freak out.
[641.82s -> 649.86s]  I am nervous as hell right now, man.
[649.86s -> 650.86s]  What's down?
[650.86s -> 651.86s]  Holy crap.
[651.86s -> 652.86s]  Get in here.
[652.86s -> 656.21s]  Get in.
[656.21s -> 661.16s]  Hide.
[661.16s -> 662.16s]  Hide.
[662.16s -> 665.83s]  Hide.
[665.83s -> 666.83s]  Hide.
[666.83s -> 669.35s]  Holy hell.
[669.35s -> 670.35s]  I don't even know if I should get out right now.
[670.35s -> 671.35s]  I really don't know if I should get out because if I get out, he might just turn around.
[671.35s -> 676.69s]  Ways like the strategy guide when you need it.
[676.69s -> 680.70s]  Looks like he's going down here.
[680.70s -> 690.67s]  This might be the best time to go and see where he stops.
[690.67s -> 691.67s]  Keep your back turned.
[691.67s -> 692.67s]  Going out now.
[692.67s -> 695.58s]  Yep.
[695.58s -> 697.33s]  There we go.
[697.33s -> 701.26s]  Okay.
[701.26s -> 702.26s]  Damn.
[702.26s -> 707.53s]  Ooh.
[707.53s -> 711.33s]  Ooh.
[711.33s -> 714.42s]  Okay.
[714.42s -> 719.18s]  Change cover.
[719.18s -> 721.77s]  Go.
[721.77s -> 722.77s]  Um.
[722.77s -> 725.35s]  No.
[725.35s -> 726.35s]  What are you doing?
[726.35s -> 727.35s]  I want to like get out of cover.
[727.35s -> 728.35s]  Not like do that.
[728.35s -> 732.86s]  There we go.
[732.86s -> 736.46s]  It's space.
[736.46s -> 737.46s]  Through here.
[737.46s -> 740.56s]  Let's make it.
[740.56s -> 744.17s]  Can I climb through?
[744.17s -> 745.17s]  One guy.
[745.17s -> 746.17s]  There's the end.
[746.17s -> 753.17s]  Right there.
[753.17s -> 758.12s]  I'm almost done.
[758.12s -> 759.12s]  Yikes.
[759.12s -> 761.26s]  This is the only guy.
[761.26s -> 766.98s]  I'm going to go around this way.
[766.98s -> 767.98s]  Is his back turned?
[767.98s -> 768.98s]  His back.
[768.98s -> 771.11s]  This guy's back is turned.
[771.11s -> 772.11s]  Oh damn it.
[772.11s -> 773.11s]  Oh damn it.
[773.11s -> 774.11s]  Oh damn it.
[774.11s -> 779.90s]  Oh damn it.
[779.90s -> 780.90s]  Oh damn it.
[780.90s -> 781.90s]  There he goes.
[781.90s -> 782.90s]  His route looks like it goes all the way down.
[782.90s -> 784.71s]  Perfect.
[784.71s -> 791.10s]  Let's get out of here.
[791.10s -> 793.66s]  Seriously get me out of here.
[793.66s -> 794.66s]  This guy's looking this way.
[794.66s -> 795.66s]  Get me out of here.
[795.66s -> 797.92s]  Oh damn it.
[797.92s -> 801.40s]  Oh I don't know.
[801.40s -> 802.40s]  I don't know.
[802.40s -> 803.40s]  I don't know.
[803.40s -> 804.40s]  I don't know.
[804.40s -> 805.40s]  He's coming all the way back here.
[805.40s -> 806.40s]  He's coming all the way back here.
[806.40s -> 808.70s]  Yeah you do know me from somewhere.
[808.70s -> 814.02s]  Oh I got to go up here.
[814.02s -> 817.43s]  Okay.
[817.43s -> 818.43s]  Oh my word.
[818.43s -> 821.40s]  This is it.
[821.40s -> 822.40s]  Where's this guy coming?
[822.40s -> 824.38s]  I don't know this guy's route.
[824.38s -> 825.48s]  I don't know this guy's route.
[825.48s -> 827.64s]  I don't know this guy's freaking route.
[827.64s -> 830.35s]  Oh no.
[830.35s -> 831.35s]  Stop right there.
[831.35s -> 832.85s]  Yes.
[832.85s -> 840.04s]  So lucky.
[840.04s -> 846.11s]  I can't believe I just did that.
[846.11s -> 848.59s]  I cannot believe I just did that.
[848.59s -> 861.62s]  How did this guy not just see me right there dude?
[861.62s -> 866.45s]  Oh it's impossible.
[866.45s -> 869.71s]  It is impossible that I just did not get spotted.
[869.71s -> 875.05s]  Release this.
[875.05s -> 879.04s]  What just happened?
[879.04s -> 880.04s]  I don't know.
[880.04s -> 881.04s]  I have no idea what just happened.
[881.04s -> 883.00s]  But I need to go out that door.
[883.00s -> 895.89s]  I make it across here.
[895.89s -> 897.89s]  Oh come on man.
[897.89s -> 901.95s]  Are you serious?
[901.95s -> 909.62s]  If I drop down here where can I go?
[909.62s -> 911.86s]  It's just a question of whether or not I can get past these two guys.
[911.86s -> 915.35s]  I wish I had that hammer still.
[915.35s -> 918.04s]  It would make things a lot easier.
[918.04s -> 922.20s]  Let's just walk by.
[922.20s -> 929.92s]  And out this way.
[929.92s -> 932.18s]  I might be able just to tactically move around up there.
[932.18s -> 934.57s]  You know what?
[934.57s -> 938.18s]  Let's do this.
[938.18s -> 939.18s]  Sayonara sucker.
[939.18s -> 942.66s]  Nope.
[942.66s -> 943.66s]  Bad idea.
[945.95s -> 949.80s]  Is it like a book I can pick up?
[949.80s -> 953.87s]  These guys follow the same route it seems.
[953.87s -> 957.11s]  Just a question of out maneuvering these two butt heads.
[957.11s -> 962.10s]  One guy's here.
[962.10s -> 963.90s]  One guy's there.
[963.90s -> 964.90s]  Let's go.
[964.90s -> 965.90s]  Let's go.
[965.90s -> 966.90s]  I'm just going for it.
[966.90s -> 975.18s]  I'm going for it baby.
[975.18s -> 977.18s]  Oh dear.
[977.18s -> 979.00s]  I made it.
[979.00s -> 984.31s]  I made it out the door.
[984.31s -> 987.15s]  Now what?
[987.15s -> 989.14s]  Looks like I can go up top.
[989.14s -> 990.14s]  Nobody up here.
[990.14s -> 991.96s]  I can start running.
[991.96s -> 996.46s]  Whoa.
[996.46s -> 1005.61s]  This place is completely empty.
[1005.61s -> 1006.61s]  Nobody up here right?
[1006.61s -> 1011.18s]  I can like walk into someone.
[1011.18s -> 1012.18s]  So what do I do here?
[1012.18s -> 1013.18s]  I have to like.
[1013.18s -> 1014.84s]  What's this?
[1014.84s -> 1016.86s]  Release the chandelier.
[1016.86s -> 1018.54s]  Releasing this will likely cause fatalities.
[1018.54s -> 1022.43s]  Well don't I want like the silent assassin?
[1022.43s -> 1028.22s]  Oh I already like killed that guy.
[1028.22s -> 1029.38s]  What if I just like walk out the door?
[1029.38s -> 1031.70s]  What if I like to say no to killing these people?
[1031.70s -> 1033.26s]  Because they're just police officers.
[1033.26s -> 1034.26s]  They didn't do no harm.
[1034.26s -> 1037.16s]  Wait a minute.
[1037.16s -> 1039.70s]  Let's see if I can just go around this way.
[1039.70s -> 1040.70s]  I can't.
[1040.70s -> 1044.34s]  I have to drop that chandelier.
[1044.34s -> 1047.21s]  I don't want to like kill these people.
[1047.21s -> 1049.25s]  The game is making me kill these guys.
[1049.25s -> 1051.40s]  I don't want to.
[1051.40s -> 1052.60s]  Oh right.
[1052.60s -> 1054.85s]  I can just walk by it.
[1054.85s -> 1057.56s]  Right.
[1057.56s -> 1058.56s]  Bang baby.
[1058.56s -> 1060.57s]  Bang.
[1060.57s -> 1062.21s]  And that is going to wrap up the episode.
