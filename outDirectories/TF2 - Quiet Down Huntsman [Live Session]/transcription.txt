[4.92s -> 9.72s]  Banco cap, that's pretty cool, but we gotta go cooler than that.
[9.72s -> 15.51s]  Body hat, yep. Uh, little snaggletooth.
[15.51s -> 19.96s]  Look at it, so cute. Hi, Mr. Snaggletooth.
[19.96s -> 20.46s]  Wow!
[21.16s -> 25.96s]  Hey, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with an on-fire gameplay commentary.
[25.96s -> 28.04s]  No, there we go, here we go. This guy's gonna die.
[28.04s -> 29.08s]  Aye, aye, aye.
[30.20s -> 33.48s]  Uh, this is gonna be, like, before I can not breathe.
[34.20s -> 37.24s]  Uh, this is gonna be a live gameplay commentary.
[37.98s -> 41.61s]  Playing as the Huntsman Sniper.
[42.17s -> 46.31s]  And as you see here, I'm gonna shoot this Pyro in the face.
[46.87s -> 51.00s]  I wasn't really prepared to start this commentary, I just for some reason was like,
[51.00s -> 53.80s]  you know what, let's just do it. I'm gonna do it right now.
[53.80s -> 56.02s]  And that's what happens.
[56.02s -> 60.04s]  Follow the unusual, just like Froot Loops, follow your nose.
[60.04s -> 65.00s]  This is a bad place for both of us to be, but somehow you managed to do that and get rid of all of them.
[65.00s -> 67.35s]  So, good job, you did it.
[67.35s -> 70.31s]  You are death- a big sentry, big sentry.
[70.31s -> 72.15s]  I'm scared.
[72.15s -> 73.43s]  Soldier friend, what do we do?
[73.43s -> 76.10s]  What are we supposed to do here?
[76.10s -> 77.61s]  We're supposed to just chill?
[77.61s -> 80.73s]  Wait for the cavalry to come bail us out?
[80.73s -> 87.58s]  Oh god, that was so close to being a long, super long headshot, but I'm in trouble here.
[87.58s -> 88.46s]  That's gonna kill me!
[90.26s -> 92.34s]  Medic, medic, I'm real, I promise.
[92.34s -> 93.22s]  I am a real boy.
[94.02s -> 94.66s]  Pinocchio.
[97.02s -> 99.90s]  Oh god, I hate when I do that.
[100.78s -> 102.46s]  It's just barely off.
[102.46s -> 105.59s]  I'll get this guy though.
[105.59s -> 107.67s]  Ah, no spies behind me.
[107.67s -> 109.59s]  Just a question, can I melee this guy?
[109.59s -> 111.03s]  Or is that not a good idea?
[111.03s -> 113.86s]  No, we're gonna do something else, completely different.
[113.86s -> 117.51s]  We're just gonna taunt kill this guy, because we were totally able to.
[117.51s -> 119.78s]  And we'll get that guy too.
[119.78s -> 122.42s]  And what about his, like, his best friend that's about to open the door?
[126.60s -> 127.64s]  At least I got him, okay.
[129.56s -> 133.88s]  That would be the third time in a row where that did not work, and it almost did.
[137.35s -> 141.99s]  Cap it, cap it, we got him, we got him locked in.
[141.99s -> 145.27s]  God, that would have hit him too.
[145.27s -> 145.91s]  Gotcha!
[146.87s -> 148.15s]  Bullseye!
[148.15s -> 150.76s]  Here we go, last chance to get it.
[150.76s -> 152.84s]  And I didn't get it, but we still won.
[152.84s -> 154.04s]  That's okay.
[154.04s -> 155.86s]  Congratulations!
[156.90s -> 157.62s]  Red team?
[157.62s -> 158.34s]  No, blue team?
[158.34s -> 159.14s]  We won!
[159.14s -> 162.07s]  Oh yeah, backflip!
[162.07s -> 163.21s]  Who wants to do a backflip?
[163.21s -> 163.61s]  Let's go.
[167.61s -> 171.10s]  Eight minutes on upward, and we already got somebody right down here.
[171.10s -> 172.38s]  You fell into the abyss.
[173.53s -> 175.13s]  That's a terrible way to go.
[175.13s -> 181.05s]  Shot in the face with an arrow, and you fall down into like a pit of hell.
[181.05s -> 183.96s]  Scared to go up that way.
[184.04s -> 186.92s]  That is not what I want to do right now, but I'll do it.
[186.92s -> 189.08s]  If you really want to, we'll do that.
[189.08s -> 190.12s]  I know you're going to get the health.
[190.76s -> 194.26s]  Shit, if I had only timed that better.
[194.26s -> 197.30s]  There it is, okay.
[197.30s -> 200.90s]  Uber, Uber's gonna end, and he's gonna come right down the hall.
[200.90s -> 201.94s]  The Uber didn't end!
[201.94s -> 202.58s]  Why did the Uber not end?
[202.58s -> 205.62s]  I thought I could have sworn that Uber was ending.
[205.62s -> 207.05s]  I don't know where to go.
[207.05s -> 210.87s]  I'm in deep trouble, deep trouble, deep trouble, deep trouble.
[210.87s -> 211.59s]  Big trouble.
[214.09s -> 218.66s]  Can we, please, just, I need to go in here and get health.
[218.66s -> 220.98s]  Coming right out the front door.
[220.98s -> 225.37s]  Make sure they don't get it.
[225.37s -> 225.85s]  Perfect.
[225.85s -> 227.05s]  I see blue laser beams.
[227.05s -> 229.75s]  That means it's a heavy right there.
[229.75s -> 231.27s]  You show me like the laser light show.
[231.27s -> 234.39s]  I'm gonna turn around and just like, just smash ya.
[234.39s -> 237.16s]  Crits.
[237.16s -> 238.20s]  The tracers on him.
[238.20s -> 239.16s]  Who's up here?
[239.16s -> 241.83s]  Anybody have interest up here?
[241.83s -> 242.79s]  Yeah, there is.
[242.79s -> 245.29s]  All right, who else is up here?
[245.29s -> 246.01s]  You.
[246.01s -> 247.64s]  You are a pyro.
[247.64s -> 248.60s]  Don't stand still.
[248.60s -> 250.30s]  You stood still.
[250.30s -> 251.10s]  Be very careful.
[252.60s -> 256.36s]  That should have been a headshot, and we all, look at, where's that arrow?
[256.36s -> 258.34s]  Where's that arrow?
[258.34s -> 260.22s]  Is arrow in his gun?
[260.22s -> 261.18s]  What was up with that?
[263.21s -> 264.49s]  I want to look at that again.
[265.54s -> 269.70s]  Because that arrow went like directly into his face.
[269.70s -> 271.29s]  But you know, whatever.
[279.11s -> 281.45s]  Good old huntsman.
[281.45s -> 282.25s]  You're gonna back up.
[282.25s -> 283.37s]  You're gonna back up right now.
[283.93s -> 286.23s]  And I didn't get you in the head, but it's okay.
[286.23s -> 288.89s]  That guy will finish you off.
[288.89s -> 292.09s]  I really appreciate the help with that.
[292.09s -> 293.61s]  Is there a sentry over here?
[293.61s -> 294.97s]  Thank goodness there isn't.
[294.97s -> 299.05s]  Because I would have just gone, and gotten eaten alive by it.
[299.05s -> 299.53s]  But you know what?
[299.53s -> 301.40s]  I do want the health.
[301.40s -> 302.12s]  It's down here.
[303.45s -> 303.93s]  Good show.
[303.93s -> 305.21s]  All right, let's keep moving.
[305.21s -> 306.36s]  Let's try not to die.
[306.36s -> 309.51s]  Try not to die one time in this run.
[309.51s -> 312.31s]  Although I say that now, and I'm gonna turn the corner and just get insta-killed.
[312.31s -> 314.65s]  So whatever.
[314.65s -> 315.77s]  Whatever happens, happens.
[315.77s -> 321.21s]  This guy right here is, if I didn't just like jump the gun right there, I would have had that.
[321.21s -> 323.05s]  But his sentry, no, he's gonna go down.
[323.05s -> 323.77s]  No, he's not.
[323.77s -> 325.69s]  He's just barely moving out of the way.
[327.02s -> 327.98s]  Oh my goodness.
[328.86s -> 330.14s]  He's running over here.
[330.14s -> 332.62s]  What the hell are you doing?
[332.62s -> 333.12s]  What is?
[334.51s -> 347.93s]  What just happened right there?
[347.93s -> 356.24s]  So I've just been informed that the baby, my niece is currently in town.
[356.24s -> 358.00s]  And she's sleeping right now.
[358.00s -> 359.84s]  They just put her to bed in the room next to me.
[359.84s -> 362.88s]  So I gotta be like real quiet.
[362.88s -> 366.83s]  So I moved the microphone right up into my face.
[366.83s -> 371.71s]  And like, hopefully it's not, hopefully it doesn't sound like Bob Ross, the painter.
[371.71s -> 374.14s]  Like, oh, you're gonna paint those mountains.
[374.14s -> 377.50s]  And you're gonna get nice long brush strokes.
[377.50s -> 380.41s]  But that's probably what I sound like.
[380.41s -> 381.85s]  So I'm really sorry.
[381.85s -> 384.65s]  But this is how it's gonna be for the remainder of the video.
[384.65s -> 386.54s]  What have we got?
[386.54s -> 389.18s]  Just scouts and pyro.
[389.18s -> 391.02s]  I couldn't even say the words.
[391.02s -> 392.22s]  They weren't coming out of my mouth.
[392.22s -> 393.74s]  But this pyro is gonna die.
[393.74s -> 394.22s]  No, he's not.
[394.22s -> 394.70s]  I lied.
[394.70s -> 395.90s]  That was a complete lie.
[399.68s -> 402.88s]  He just, you see, I got him so bad that he got sucked into the earth.
[402.88s -> 403.52s]  Be quiet.
[403.52s -> 406.62s]  Okay, don't want to wake the baby.
[406.62s -> 407.98s]  Don't wake the baby.
[407.98s -> 411.50s]  That's really important even though you just got a sick kill.
[411.50s -> 412.20s]  It's all right.
[412.20s -> 413.69s]  Just pack it up.
[413.69s -> 415.21s]  Get in here.
[415.21s -> 417.85s]  Pick up the extra health and ammunition.
[417.85s -> 420.14s]  Then we're gonna turn here.
[420.14s -> 421.74s]  And I thought I was gonna...
[421.74s -> 423.10s]  Oh, boy, he noticed me.
[423.10s -> 423.42s]  I'm dead.
[423.42s -> 424.81s]  I'm dead here.
[424.81s -> 426.41s]  Holy shit in my pants.
[427.13s -> 430.24s]  Shit inside of my pants.
[430.24s -> 432.56s]  There is just shit filling my underwear right now.
[438.24s -> 442.78s]  Shit.
[442.78s -> 444.06s]  Ooh, spy.
[444.70s -> 447.07s]  Got the soldier.
[447.07s -> 447.71s]  Got the soldier.
[448.43s -> 450.91s]  Two scouts just back to back right now?
[451.55s -> 452.35s]  We have a sentry?
[452.99s -> 455.00s]  Oh, that would have hit him in the face.
[456.00s -> 456.56s]  Where is he?
[457.12s -> 458.48s]  No, you're not getting away.
[458.48s -> 460.27s]  You're not getting away.
[461.29s -> 464.25s]  I hit him right in like the neck with an arrow to that first shot.
[464.25s -> 471.68s]  I can always feel myself like exhaling after missing one of those.
[471.68s -> 473.60s]  The breath comes out swift.
[473.60s -> 475.58s]  Anyone behind me?
[475.58s -> 476.22s]  Anyone behind me?
[477.12s -> 477.68s]  Okay.
[477.68s -> 478.24s]  All right.
[478.24s -> 478.96s]  We're cool.
[478.96s -> 479.44s]  We cool?
[480.62s -> 481.58s]  No, we're not cool.
[481.58s -> 482.54s]  We're not cool.
[482.54s -> 486.33s]  We're not cool because I got shot right in the back of the head.
[486.33s -> 490.78s]  I'm just gonna bump into the microphone because it's so close to my face.
[490.78s -> 493.18s]  I can pretty much brush my teeth with it.
[493.18s -> 501.66s]  If I had a Colgate toothpaste, I could turn this into a toothbrush microphone.
[501.66s -> 502.86s]  Son of a bitch.
[502.86s -> 506.65s]  Oh, you had to jump.
[506.65s -> 507.93s]  You had to jump.
[507.93s -> 510.70s]  Dude, that guy's legs were missing.
[510.70s -> 514.32s]  That guy was just didn't have any legs.
[514.32s -> 517.10s]  That was very odd.
[517.10s -> 520.65s]  Can I make it across here?
[520.65s -> 525.90s]  I wonder if I can sneakily get over here and like taunt kill somebody.
[525.90s -> 527.42s]  Probably could have just got that guy.
[527.42s -> 528.81s]  Give me the health.
[528.81s -> 529.45s]  Come on.
[529.45s -> 531.39s]  Give me the health.
[531.39s -> 532.03s]  Please spawn.
[532.59s -> 533.79s]  Hello, everyone.
[533.79s -> 535.31s]  It's me, God.
[535.31s -> 538.51s]  Just wanted to say that health doesn't spawn here.
[538.51s -> 539.95s]  Jerma is an idiot.
[539.95s -> 541.36s]  Let's get back to the video.
[541.36s -> 543.80s]  I will now unfreeze time.
[543.80s -> 544.20s]  Spawn.
[545.24s -> 546.12s]  Health, please.
[547.02s -> 547.42s]  Health.
[547.98s -> 551.71s]  Where is the fucking health?
[554.22s -> 555.95s]  It's okay.
[555.95s -> 557.98s]  We won the game.
[557.98s -> 558.22s]  All right.
[558.22s -> 562.14s]  Well, I think that might be it because I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to
[562.14s -> 565.66s]  play like this leaned in, like brushing my teeth on the microphone.
[565.66s -> 568.38s]  So yeah, thanks everybody for watching.
[568.38s -> 569.10s]  Take care, everybody.
[569.10s -> 569.66s]  Goodbye.
