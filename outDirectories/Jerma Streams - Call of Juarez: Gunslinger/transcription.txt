[1.59s -> 15.10s]  Hey guys, what is with this LUL boy thing? I make a couple of typos and all of a sudden,
[15.10s -> 18.62s]  why would I watch German when I can watch late night TV? I mean, that's a question for you.
[19.42s -> 32.52s]  I don't get it because I'm not an LUL boy. Every time I write LUL, people laugh at me.
[33.66s -> 41.34s]  Okay, look, when I write this, right, back in my day, we didn't have emotes to show our
[41.34s -> 46.62s]  feelings. So if you thought something was really, really funny, you'd go like this.
[49.61s -> 52.73s]  But people make fun of me when I do that, so now I'm trying to be hip and be cool,
[53.69s -> 64.33s]  and when I do the new one, I'm not allowed to do that either. So what should I go back to do
[64.33s -> 80.44s]  it? Should I do this? Just don't express any of your emotions. Ah, that's a nice hot coffee.
[82.04s -> 86.06s]  But yeah, today we're gonna chill. The next couple days actually gonna be a little
[86.06s -> 92.41s]  more relaxed. I don't know why I keep saying that, but we've had some intense
[93.29s -> 100.78s]  stuff going on the last week or so. The VR last night went pretty late. It was all over the
[100.78s -> 109.21s]  place. So today we're gonna do something that I tried to do a couple years ago,
[110.89s -> 118.70s]  and that is play Call of Juarez Gunslinger. There was technical problems last time.
[118.70s -> 128.54s]  They shouldn't be there now. I tested it. Let's hope that even after testing
[130.28s -> 145.83s]  that we can actually do it. And then tomorrow is Chillstream 2.0. Tomorrow all bets are off for
[145.83s -> 151.38s]  whatever the hell is gonna be on the screen. We've got some videos we can watch. I might
[151.38s -> 157.51s]  just start to, I might just play the first episode of Sam and Max. Maybe we'll play Picross.
[157.51s -> 167.22s]  I don't know. But today we're gonna dial it back a little. And I'm just gonna play a game
[167.22s -> 171.62s]  that I've wanted to play for a couple years. And I forgot that I wanted to play it. Because
[171.62s -> 185.10s]  a couple years ago I was really into it. Labo stream. Here we go. Here comes the next
[185.10s -> 208.71s]  Labo. No. No, I gotta like dial it down. Let me make a tweet. Cooking stream with mom.
[208.71s -> 223.24s]  No. I think I've seen too many intense things over the last week. Let's just hang out and play
[223.24s -> 238.49s]  a cowboy game, right? And just chill. Cooking is intense. Yeah, have you ever cooked anything
[238.49s -> 245.21s]  before? It's a constant never-ending stress in your brain that you don't want to over or
[245.21s -> 248.57s]  under cook the thing that you're cooking. So you pace around. You like put your hand in
[248.57s -> 253.78s]  your mouth like, ah, okay, is it ready yet? No, it's not. Don't touch it. And then you
[253.78s -> 258.55s]  flip it and you're not supposed to flip it and you get mad at yourself. I can't cook.
[259.19s -> 262.55s]  I can only cook three meals and they're like 10 out of 10. So that's the only thing I can do.
[267.32s -> 275.94s]  So let me, let's get this on the screen here. You need to see to believe. Yeah,
[276.74s -> 283.50s]  you'll see one day. All right, let's get it up. All right, everybody cross your fingers.
[288.30s -> 295.70s]  I tested it already. But is this game going to actually work this time? I'm gonna turn
[295.70s -> 312.06s]  some of this down even more. That's better. All right, I'm ready. Here we go. Put the
[312.06s -> 319.69s]  subtitles in French. Why would I put the subtitles in French? Who here speaks French? Does anybody
[319.69s -> 331.93s]  here actually speak French? All right, story. New game. I told you I tested it so I want to do a
[331.93s -> 348.74s]  new game. This normal hard and true west. How hard is hard? I can't even select true west.
[348.74s -> 362.52s]  All right, is this, this is like 2010 hard. That could be very hard. Hard is normal.
[364.66s -> 378.38s]  I don't, uh, okay. Sticks. Sticks is the, uh, I'm doing normal. I'm not gonna do hard. This is
[378.38s -> 387.27s]  supposed to be a relaxing hangout stream today. Do you want me to like fucking clench my ass and
[387.27s -> 400.15s]  try as hard as I can? You picked the easiest. Why does it have to be easy? Why can't there be an
[400.15s -> 409.78s]  easy underneath that? You, sir? Be so? I haven't been here in many years. Named Silas
[409.78s -> 419.45s]  Greaves. Silas Greaves? The bounty hunter? Used to be. What are you doing here? Just passing
[419.45s -> 426.33s]  through. That's Ben 10's dad. Well, sir, it would be an honor if you would allow me to buy
[426.33s -> 433.77s]  you a beer. Hell, son, it would be my honor to drink it. I'm Molly. Howdy. I'm Dwight.
[433.77s -> 438.81s]  That's Jack and Steve. Ben's behind the bar. Oh, Ben. Ben 10. I bet you got some great
[438.81s -> 447.45s]  stories. A couple. Any of them true? Jack, be nice. A few. What about your shootout with
[447.45s -> 452.41s]  Henry Plummer's gang in Bannock Montana? Is that where you started as a bounty hunter?
[453.05s -> 458.23s]  That's what it says in this here dime novel. Don't believe everything you read in them dime
[458.23s -> 464.47s]  novels, boy. First man I hunted was back when I was riding with Billy the Kid.
[464.47s -> 471.11s]  You knew Billy the Kid? Damn right. L-U-L, boy. That scrawny son of a bitch had no fear.
[471.11s -> 475.91s]  Wouldn't back down for nobody. I heard he collected the ten stars off any crooked law
[475.91s -> 482.47s]  men who crossed him. It was a war, boy. The Lincoln County War. And Billy promised his
[482.47s -> 487.27s]  regulators would take the life of every bastard who helped bushwhack John Tunstall.
[488.71s -> 494.30s]  Kid had a big chip on his shoulder and a hair trigger temper. Made him dangerous as hell.
[495.90s -> 500.62s]  Is the game good? Is it? I know I've wanted to play it for a while, but is this a good game,
[500.62s -> 511.02s]  right? I remember, yeah, I remember I tried to play this like two years ago.
[514.09s -> 522.33s]  Fuck it, let's just play it. Who gives a shit, right? It was about 30 years ago.
[524.31s -> 531.45s]  Billy was hiding out in an abandoned farm near Stinking Springs. Well, property value
[531.45s -> 538.81s]  probably ain't high on that place. Stinking Springs. But before I tell you why I want
[538.89s -> 544.09s]  that son of a bitch dead, let me tell you what happened that day. I was heading back.
[544.09s -> 551.53s]  I think we're running fine. When suddenly I had this funny feeling. Funny ha ha? No, Steve.
[552.09s -> 556.09s]  The other kind of funny. Was that Joe Pesci? Why is Joe Pesci talking to me about
[556.09s -> 568.41s]  playing funny like a clown? Funny like ha ha funny? Uh, okay. Is there any like secrets?
[576.73s -> 582.79s]  Well, uh, guys, this is a plus. The game runs. Press O to see objectives.
[584.20s -> 586.36s]  Turn to the hideout. So it just puts it on the ground.
[589.96s -> 594.60s]  I knew those two morons would never let me through. I had no choice.
[600.36s -> 604.04s]  That was clean. You're inexperienced by killing enemies. You need it for leveling
[604.04s -> 614.25s]  up and gaining extra abilities. Okay. Was it Pat Garrett's posse? Oh yeah,
[614.25s -> 617.61s]  shift to sprint. Wait, I heard the shots and I knew I had to move fast.
[617.61s -> 622.58s]  Hold on. I know you want to move fast, but I need you to hold on a second. I need toggle on.
[625.54s -> 636.47s]  Is there toggle? Aiming vibration. Auto aim. Why is auto aim on? Oh, this is for controller.
[636.47s -> 664.65s]  Okay. Uh oh. Crouch toggle is on. Aim is okay. Melee. Melee is going to be this.
[665.53s -> 669.91s]  Quick throw dynamite is going to be this. Why can I not make it that?
[673.80s -> 684.36s]  No. No, fire is pee pee. Right? Right? Right, Twitch chat? Isn't that funny? Um,
[685.16s -> 691.34s]  I can't make my the mouse button. So there is no toggle aim, is there?
[692.62s -> 706.25s]  E-O-A-U. Next weapon. Wheel. One, two, three. Grab weapon. Move hand? There's a sprint toggle.
[706.25s -> 715.32s]  There's no aim toggle. My life is going to be hell in this game. Garrett and his army
[715.32s -> 721.05s]  of deputies has surrounded the entire homestead. So I'll use it as an excuse. I'll take care of it.
[729.51s -> 733.83s]  Actually doesn't feel that bad. I decided to help Billy and the boys out of it.
[733.83s -> 737.43s]  Gunning down enemies fills your concentration gauge. Press, okay, then you press Q.
[743.77s -> 748.02s]  All right. So this is, this is bullet storm, but in the old west.
[753.03s -> 765.74s]  Hey, crouch. That wasn't a headshot. Oh, these are my friends. No, they're not.
[765.74s -> 795.99s]  Let's move. Who's left? Who's it? Who are? Where are you? I knew that going through that front door
[795.99s -> 800.47s]  had been putting my butt in a shooting gallery. So I decided to get sneaky.
[803.77s -> 813.67s]  Is that a person doing a dog? Secret. Show nugget info. The Lincoln County War is often
[813.67s -> 819.45s]  considered one of the most famous examples of a range war in the history of the west.
[819.53s -> 822.65s]  Range wars were conflicts over the control of open range or rangeland
[823.61s -> 827.77s]  freely used for cattle grazing. The disputes were usually over grazing or water rights.
[828.57s -> 832.89s]  But in this case, the fight was over the control of dry goods trade in Lincoln County.
[833.53s -> 837.21s]  The quarrel rose around a conflict of interest between the Dolan Murphy faction
[837.21s -> 843.91s]  and a newly arrived Englishman, John Tunstall. At first, they tried to use the legal system
[843.91s -> 848.95s]  to resolve their dispute, but soon the fight evolved into a conflict between armed gangs.
[850.15s -> 855.19s]  Murphy and Dolan had ties to outlaws like John Kinney and his gang Jesse Evans,
[855.19s -> 861.03s]  whose outfit was known as the Boys. They were responsible for the death of Tunstall,
[861.03s -> 866.15s]  which became the central catalyst of the conflict. The other side had the regulators,
[866.15s -> 870.87s]  William Bonney, aka Billy the Kid, rode with them promising revenge on the men who
[870.87s -> 875.67s]  murdered Tunstall. Both sides were sworn in by different officers of the law, so technically
[875.67s -> 880.07s]  they were all acting within the law. After the regulators were defeated,
[880.07s -> 885.91s]  some of their members became fugitives and just like Billy the Kid, met untimely and violent ends.
[887.30s -> 894.73s]  This has been our Top 5 Coolest WTF Moments from Modern American History.
[907.08s -> 909.74s]  Stay Notified!
[962.30s -> 963.18s]  Easy target.
[966.78s -> 967.66s]  Minus two.
[969.34s -> 973.86s]  Can I look without doing it?
[973.86s -> 985.62s]  Yeah. Eagle Eye. Iron Sight slows down time. That's cool.
[986.34s -> 993.85s]  Do well revolvers. That's cool too.
[994.57s -> 1002.17s]  I'm a trapper. I don't think I want to do this.
[1005.19s -> 1007.99s]  Deep dynamite. Higher combos and concentration.
[1007.99s -> 1014.17s]  I think I'm gonna go with the Ranger. That sounds cool.
[1015.13s -> 1023.03s]  Iron Sight slows down time. You get a fraction of concentration like slowdown,
[1023.03s -> 1028.18s]  just enough to aim perfectly. Yeah, I'm gonna get it.
[1032.82s -> 1034.90s]  Rifle ammo capacity. I'm gonna do Rav Rifle.
[1035.62s -> 1039.96s]  So I don't get points available. So now let's see how that works.
[1049.34s -> 1053.90s]  Whoa! But you can avoid lethal shots only when your sense of death is charged.
[1055.82s -> 1058.94s]  Avoid the bullet using A to dodge left or D to dodge right.
[1059.90s -> 1065.16s]  Garrett's man was running around like a bunch of chickens with their hands turned up.
[1065.16s -> 1077.82s]  That's actually pretty cool. Anybody else? Yep.
[1078.46s -> 1084.02s]  All right. Anybody who's left alive?
[1088.10s -> 1092.50s]  Luckily these shooters Garrett hired weren't the sharpest tools in the ship.
[1092.50s -> 1097.86s]  Like this is cool. A lot of them were saddle triumphs or sodbusters or drunken drifters
[1097.86s -> 1099.22s]  looking to make a few bucks.
[1100.90s -> 1106.82s]  The shooting is actually really fun. Whoa! Who's next to me?
[1107.62s -> 1125.10s]  What's melee? Oh, okay.
[1125.82s -> 1132.06s]  This game could easily be a light gun game. I can see that.
[1140.71s -> 1142.71s]  Fight your way to the rear entrance of the farmhouse.
[1149.11s -> 1153.61s]  What? I thought he was holding like a baby or something. That was fucking weird.
[1154.89s -> 1159.38s]  Does this count your headshots?
[1167.22s -> 1167.78s]  Where is this dude?
[1178.14s -> 1182.86s]  This could easily be a crossover with Mr. Mosquito.
[1184.82s -> 1187.14s]  Wait, what about secrets? I'm not going to just blow through. Hold on.
[1187.94s -> 1191.67s]  How could this be a Mr. Mosquito crossover?
[1198.50s -> 1202.34s]  Sometimes people just write a sentence and then I read it for some reason.
[1209.35s -> 1214.33s]  Is there like a sneak?
[1214.33s -> 1237.85s]  Secret. Oh, there's three in here. Hold on. How many skills do I have?
[1245.54s -> 1250.70s]  God damn it. I really crack shot.
[1253.19s -> 1256.23s]  Smart as a whip. 21 killed by age 21.
[1267.53s -> 1271.69s]  Sort of. I keep doing these like weird Spider-Man introspectives.
[1286.33s -> 1287.05s]  Rifle's the best.
[1310.20s -> 1314.63s]  Action-liver rifle's the best. Yeah, this is the bolt. I can feel the bolt.
[1315.59s -> 1320.44s]  I can hear it. That lights a lot of pluses.
[1321.72s -> 1324.60s]  That barrel just told a really funny fucking joke. It should have hurt it.
[1325.08s -> 1351.69s]  No, get out of the way. We good? No, not yet. Where?
[1365.85s -> 1372.33s]  Whoa. S? What? What's going on? Wait, what?
[1374.33s -> 1387.67s]  I didn't have to. S? S. All right. S is shoot.
[1387.99s -> 1403.32s]  Is somebody in a Heinz helicopter? All right.
[1414.87s -> 1429.02s]  Dumbass. Oh, boy. Whoa. Bring the horses from the stable.
[1434.04s -> 1442.09s]  Where are those horses? What? Oh, over here.
[1446.76s -> 1454.68s]  Now where was that? That guy was just hiding behind you. He was the door.
[1454.68s -> 1468.38s]  You were heading. What? Oh, melee. I, right, right. I changed melee to my mouse button.
[1472.49s -> 1475.29s]  I at least got to hold the page in the Choose Your Own Adventure book.
[1476.09s -> 1500.74s]  Get the bomb. It's good. Sounds like Garrett hired a whole regiment of hired guns.
[1500.90s -> 1509.70s]  Oh, Jesus.
[1518.39s -> 1530.07s]  And here comes somebody, right? That guy was hiding in there. He had the pumpkin on his head.
[1542.71s -> 1546.71s]  All right. That was a fun level. That was a fun tutorial level.
[1555.38s -> 1561.70s]  Proud, handsome, and hand-handed. Pat Garrett. See you in the next German Rumble.
[1564.36s -> 1565.32s]  Right. You're gonna be there.
[1581.11s -> 1588.73s]  Okay. Focus. Keep your energy, keep your enemy in focus using the mouse. Press space. They're
[1588.73s -> 1601.42s]  gonna keep them in the, put the camera on them. It's a little slow. Focus. Where do I need to shoot
[1601.42s -> 1611.11s]  them? That's not what my intention was, but when your opponent reaches for their gun, press
[1611.67s -> 1613.91s]  to draw you up in an aim and then shoot.
[1622.70s -> 1629.02s]  In a fair fight. Is that what that penny dreadful says? No. Right there. That ain't what I meant
[1629.02s -> 1635.26s]  when I said I met Pat Garrett. So let me start again. What? We're gonna do this whole thing
[1635.26s -> 1649.26s]  again? It's hard to control that. Don't tell them about shooting the guy in the balls.
[1650.70s -> 1657.53s]  Last thing I heard was Garrett's voice. That's not totally not on purpose. I mean,
[1657.53s -> 1661.37s]  initially it wasn't, but the second half of that maybe wasn't.
[1672.26s -> 1682.86s]  68. 70% accuracy. Rifle. Award of choice. Headshot. Honorably killed. I only got two out of
[1682.86s -> 1687.16s]  three nuggets. All right. I get one point available. What's down here? Let's see.
[1688.04s -> 1696.55s]  Truth-seeking. Don't miss any important details. Additional sounds and hints will lead
[1696.55s -> 1703.54s]  you to the hidden nuggets of truth, provided you get close enough. That's not bad. Or
[1703.54s -> 1715.98s]  ammo capacity increased. What does that lead to? Additional zoom while aiming. Hold your
[1715.98s -> 1723.38s]  breath and be more precise. You'll be able to zoom even more. And this one is fast rifle
[1723.38s -> 1738.15s]  reload. Fast rifle reload on this one, interestingly enough. I think I'll do more
[1738.15s -> 1750.36s]  ammo. We'll go this way. Do you live on a racetrack? No, I live in Vegas. We'll get
[1750.36s -> 1760.65s]  more ammo. Seems like it was a bit easy after all. Would you like to switch to hard
[1760.73s -> 1773.03s]  difficulty? I can't. What am I going to on stream say no to that?
[1785.50s -> 1788.94s]  Hey, you did that pretty easily. I think your audience might start resident sleeper-ing if
[1788.94s -> 1791.18s]  you don't go to hard.
[1791.74s -> 1811.10s]  You'd like red steel for the Wii. Yeah, that game was really just
[1811.10s -> 1820.47s]  interesting and odd, wasn't it? All right. Fistful of hot lead.
[1829.91s -> 1834.47s]  Lincoln jail. April 28th, 1881. Four months after the arrest.
[1837.27s -> 1843.56s]  They were sworn enemies of Billy's regulator. Why were you after him? I owed that son of
[1843.56s -> 1850.07s]  a bitch a bullet for what he had done to me and mine. Instead, all I got for myself
[1850.07s -> 1857.13s]  was a goddamn death sentence. Prison break sequence? It was right around then that I
[1857.13s -> 1864.73s]  heard Billy make his move. This is on hard now. I gotta get up. I was lying on my back
[1864.73s -> 1868.49s]  this whole time. That's why I think I sounded a little weird earlier. Planted a pistol
[1868.49s -> 1874.55s]  for him in the privy. What the papers didn't say is that Billy helped me escape too.
[1878.94s -> 1893.69s]  What? Okay. My first order of business was finding a firearm. I gotta find a gun. Do
[1893.69s -> 1896.41s]  I have a melee? I don't think I can do anything. All right, I gotta be careful
[1896.41s -> 1912.78s]  because it's on hard now. Oh, William. I'm not gonna do that again. Cool. Let's
[1912.78s -> 1920.57s]  get the get you get little nuggets of info. These give experience, right? They
[1920.65s -> 1930.38s]  give a lot of experience. Jesus. Okay. Fast rifle reload. Reload your rifle in the
[1930.38s -> 1933.42s]  blink of an eye. Inserting the cartridges from the bottom of your rifle can cut
[1933.42s -> 1938.38s]  down the reload by 50 percent. Uh, yeah, I think so. Sounds pretty great.
[1939.18s -> 1950.36s]  Gun? Oh, there's a gun.
[1959.43s -> 1962.63s]  10 gauge. Loudest thunder.
[1964.39s -> 1976.97s]  A man clean in half. What does this look like? I forgot that's the title.
[1976.97s -> 1980.89s]  I should take to the rooftops to make my escape. So I did.
[1983.42s -> 1987.24s]  Exit the jail. It's on hard. Okay, I can't fucking run.
[1989.67s -> 1992.55s]  That scattered gun was like a double-barreled hell wizard.
[1993.82s -> 2001.18s]  Is there like a queue or can I? Thank God. Should have built this.
[2009.90s -> 2016.04s]  So it'll be good for you, Jerbo. Okay, use the roofs to escape.
[2016.04s -> 2018.36s]  I'm just gonna go this way. Any secrets? What secrets?
[2021.70s -> 2025.45s]  Shouldn't have shot from up here. What was that?
[2035.80s -> 2038.70s]  Why is it? I'm so confused.
[2042.06s -> 2057.78s]  We're gonna get through here. God. Down here. Okay. Good thing hard mode
[2057.78s -> 2059.78s]  still has the please go this direction.
[2064.26s -> 2068.18s]  Only a grievous harm, but I knew if I was ever going to find him,
[2068.18s -> 2070.66s]  I would need to get my ever loving ass out of there.
[2071.78s -> 2077.11s]  I tried to be stealthy and sneak my way past.
[2078.87s -> 2082.74s]  He's streaming right now. I don't need to say anything.
[2089.08s -> 2092.04s]  I'm gonna take this one stealthy. Good thing I don't need to reload this.
[2092.68s -> 2094.76s]  Can't really aim it that well, but doesn't matter, you know.
[2096.60s -> 2115.56s]  Okay, got ammo now. Do I have to buy the guns? No. Make your way through the town.
[2125.56s -> 2129.94s]  Tell us more. Apparently, some of them thought I was Billy.
[2133.30s -> 2149.93s]  Oh, that was good. See, me and the kid shared a certain similarity in build and coloring.
[2152.33s -> 2155.61s]  I was just glad I had Deputy Bob's mean ass gun.
[2155.61s -> 2170.02s]  Oh no! No! Okay, I'm fine. 30 FOV. Is it?
[2175.94s -> 2181.06s]  Is it that bad? It looks like it's somewhere around. How do I change it?
[2182.71s -> 2194.15s]  It's very low. Is it? Now that you say it, now that you mentioned that, it is a little low.
[2205.42s -> 2208.62s]  I don't think, yeah, can I not change it in the game? I might not be able to change it.
[2212.73s -> 2225.46s]  Unless it's a game of an eye and eye? You can do it in the config. All right, well then yeah.
[2226.26s -> 2237.64s]  Once we get to a checkpoint, I'll do it. I'm trying to get points.
[2242.97s -> 2246.09s]  Thank you, it's making me sick. All right, yeah, I don't want to make it be sick, you know.
[2250.57s -> 2270.47s]  You can disable the screen border. Yeah, maybe I'll do that too. What the hell was that?
[2271.11s -> 2286.81s]  Can I get through there? Oh, yeah, I'm up. I'll be at checkpoint in like a minute here.
[2287.53s -> 2295.77s]  Where was the kid while you were busy getting shot at?
[2295.77s -> 2301.48s]  Plan forth reload. Gone. And that's when it occurred to me why Billy set me free.
[2301.48s -> 2322.28s]  Wow. All right, I did it. Did I not get him? It's the guy that is a door guy here.
[2332.04s -> 2343.18s]  Oh my god, what's happening? What? Was that another door guy? I have no idea what that was.
[2347.03s -> 2350.55s]  Deputy Bob Olinger was organizing a posse to put me down.
[2352.01s -> 2357.37s]  He was already a mean son of a bitch, but he was doubly pissed that I stole his mean-ass shotgun.
[2358.81s -> 2364.25s]  Anyway, it was me or them, and the only way forward led me straight to perdition.
[2364.25s -> 2367.37s]  But the cards were dealt and I had no choice but to play them.
[2368.57s -> 2371.05s]  He's nice talking about when he went to the casino last week.
[2375.03s -> 2378.55s]  That's out of the stream last day. What I did last night.
[2380.30s -> 2385.43s]  Played some fucking cards and shit. Oh damn, I almost got hit by that one.
[2389.96s -> 2427.26s]  I don't want to talk over the streamer. Oh my god, die. I wish I had my rifle.
[2427.26s -> 2437.43s]  I built into rifles, not into pistols. I could get up there and shoot a shotgun.
[2443.42s -> 2448.89s]  Holy shit, there's a guy right here.
[2470.41s -> 2480.20s]  Oh, the stables on the edge of town.
[2490.02s -> 2493.78s]  Guess Billy saved your ass, taking out Bob Olinger the way he did.
[2493.78s -> 2498.18s]  Billy didn't kill Bob. Sure he did. He dispatched him right after he shot him.
[2498.18s -> 2500.10s]  Are we gonna rewind again? No, sir.
[2500.82s -> 2505.46s]  Because Bob came right up behind me angry as hell that Billy had lit out.
[2505.46s -> 2511.38s]  Hello Bob. I said, I think you better let me go.
[2511.38s -> 2514.34s]  He's in a Peter Griffin costume. I don't think so, boy.
[2515.06s -> 2521.88s]  Not with my shotgun. So we stood there in the middle of the street, eyeball to eyeball.
[2523.32s -> 2527.64s]  He intended to kill me and I knew I had no choice but to defend myself.
[2527.64s -> 2529.88s]  Just your hand position is aimed for faster draw.
[2535.30s -> 2539.46s]  Oh fuck, I gotta play the claw game and I have to keep this guy in focus?
[2540.18s -> 2547.74s]  When you hear the heartbeat, you can draw your gun first,
[2548.54s -> 2552.31s]  but this will be noted as dishonorable and scored accordingly.
[2558.95s -> 2563.46s]  Fuck. That was quick.
[2565.61s -> 2575.51s]  You were focused so that your hand speed was 42% and your reaction time was 0.6600 milliseconds.
[2576.23s -> 2579.32s]  I'm better than that. I'm like 200 milliseconds.
[2579.96s -> 2607.35s]  What? I didn't know I had to aim a second time.
[2608.07s -> 2610.23s]  I didn't know I had to aim a second time.
[2610.23s -> 2613.67s]  I thought he just shoot with the shot over his head.
[2615.51s -> 2616.87s]  0.3 seconds. That's better.
[2621.64s -> 2623.00s]  These are going to get so hard.
[2645.51s -> 2650.23s]  I killed him in a fair fight. Everybody saw I had no damn choice.
[2651.43s -> 2655.98s]  Well, Lincoln got a might depopulated that day.
[2655.98s -> 2659.99s]  That Garret gunned down Billy three months later.
[2659.99s -> 2662.71s]  So his escape was all for naught anyway.
[2666.42s -> 2668.39s]  New skills.
[2671.32s -> 2672.52s]  What is this one?
[2675.29s -> 2677.69s]  It's not just pretty, but an engineering masterpiece
[2678.57s -> 2679.93s]  and a very deadly fire round.
[2679.93s -> 2681.93s]  The simplified trigger mechanism and longer barrel.
[2682.73s -> 2684.74s]  Faster rate of fire and better handling.
[2685.46s -> 2688.60s]  And then ultimately we get the golden rifle.
[2690.89s -> 2691.53s]  Quick fingers.
[2692.33s -> 2698.36s]  Reload rate increased by smashing handle your bullets with care.
[2698.36s -> 2699.24s]  Wait, smashing?
[2699.80s -> 2704.44s]  Smash R like Loco during the reload sequence to insert rounds faster.
[2705.16s -> 2713.61s]  Okay. Legendary weapon unlocked.
[2714.17s -> 2716.49s]  I already got a legendary weapon.
[2718.97s -> 2719.45s]  Jesus.
[2721.74s -> 2722.94s]  Already a legendary.
[2723.96s -> 2727.24s]  Okay. So I want to let's just continue for a second.
[2727.24s -> 2728.60s]  Let me get the loading screen there.
[2728.60s -> 2730.20s]  Get the save point in the top, right?
[2730.20s -> 2731.16s]  And then I'm going to change the FOV.
[2731.16s -> 2732.76s]  So where'd you go after Lincoln?
[2733.82s -> 2734.46s]  Mexico.
[2735.10s -> 2738.47s]  Until I realized nobody was looking for me.
[2738.47s -> 2740.95s]  I ended up taking a job at the Rurales.
[2740.95s -> 2742.47s]  The Mexican Rurales?
[2743.43s -> 2746.63s]  I was hired to help them track down the cowboys.
[2747.83s -> 2753.69s]  Most vicious outlaw gang in Cochise County?
[2754.33s -> 2755.85s]  Curly Bill Brocious?
[2755.85s -> 2756.97s]  Johnny Ringo?
[2756.97s -> 2758.89s]  Led by old man Clint himself.
[2760.09s -> 2764.09s]  They must have paid you a pretty penny to take him on, Brazone.
[2764.09s -> 2765.56s]  Not really.
[2765.56s -> 2769.80s]  But truth be told, I had my own reasons for going after those boys.
[2771.24s -> 2774.68s]  So somebody said that this game only has like five levels.
[2775.88s -> 2777.80s]  Are you telling me I'm more than halfway through the whole game?
[2787.14s -> 2788.42s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[2788.42s -> 2790.10s]  This game's not 20 minutes long.
[2796.73s -> 2797.85s]  So was the bastard you were after-
[2797.85s -> 2801.05s]  All right, so I got new nuggets of truth.
[2801.69s -> 2802.49s]  I already saw them.
[2803.05s -> 2806.65s]  Let me just quit out and go to the INI.
[2807.45s -> 2808.41s]  Is it really that simple?
[2808.41s -> 2810.09s]  It's not a bunch of bullshit where I have to-
[2810.09s -> 2811.21s]  I can just do it in the INI, right?
[2823.82s -> 2824.30s]  Hopefully.
[2824.30s -> 2825.10s]  Yeah, the INI.
[2825.74s -> 2826.54s]  Yeah, it's in the INI.
[2826.54s -> 2827.04s]  Okay.
[2827.74s -> 2829.37s]  Give me a second.
[2831.21s -> 2834.41s]  I'm gonna put the BRB screen up just to have it up.
[2834.41s -> 2837.64s]  And put it on 90.
[2838.44s -> 2846.71s]  Oh, there's actually like a Steam discussion link that somebody put up.
[2847.35s -> 2851.11s]  Okay.
[2851.11s -> 2852.62s]  Let's see.
[2853.24s -> 2853.74s]  FOV.
[2855.22s -> 2857.78s]  Navigate to your settings.
[2857.78s -> 2861.78s]  Your drag video SCR onto Notepad to edit its contents.
[2861.78s -> 2863.54s]  Oh yeah, pretty self-explanatory.
[2867.19s -> 2869.03s]  360 degree FOV.
[2869.03s -> 2870.39s]  No, I can't do that.
[2870.39s -> 2874.12s]  Okay, so we're gonna go to users.
[2875.00s -> 2877.66s]  Mm-hmm.
[2878.36s -> 2882.86s]  Oh, you gotta go into the actual app data, huh?
[2883.42s -> 2884.86s]  Oh, that's annoying.
[2891.67s -> 2893.67s]  Let me open up like my app data then.
[2907.03s -> 2907.75s]  App data.
[2908.47s -> 2910.54s]  It's kind of hard to get there on Windows 10.
[2910.54s -> 2911.42s]  You have to search for it.
[2913.78s -> 2914.26s]  Local...
[2914.82s -> 2916.34s]  Wait, Techland made this game.
[2929.00s -> 2932.33s]  Shit, it might not be here.
[2932.33s -> 2935.13s]  No, this is like a Windows 7 like tutorial.
[2935.93s -> 2937.48s]  I'm gonna have to do that.
[2937.48s -> 2938.44s]  Local app data.
[2946.07s -> 2946.95s]  Local app data.
[2947.51s -> 2950.79s]  Is Techland in here?
[2952.25s -> 2953.21s]  Techland, there it is.
[2954.17s -> 2958.26s]  Gunslinger out settings.
[2958.26s -> 2959.30s]  Here we go, video.
[2963.13s -> 2964.65s]  All right, so let's hope this doesn't break the game.
[2965.37s -> 2972.07s]  So now we're gonna drag this onto Notepad.
[2972.07s -> 2973.43s]  Or just open it with Notepad.
[2981.19s -> 2982.71s]  I'm gonna feel like it's gonna turn off.
[2991.02s -> 2994.04s]  Put it on the desktop.
[2994.04s -> 2997.99s]  How do I drag this onto Notepad though?
[2998.71s -> 3001.54s]  Because like Notepad...
[3002.34s -> 3004.86s]  I can't like open this with Notepad for some reason.
[3007.37s -> 3008.49s]  Send to open.
[3008.49s -> 3009.37s]  I can't open it with...
[3011.85s -> 3013.93s]  Yeah, usually I just right click and then open with.
[3013.93s -> 3016.89s]  There is no open with on this because it's like an SCR file.
[3017.61s -> 3022.01s]  Oh, let's just...
[3022.01s -> 3022.73s]  Okay, Notepad.
[3025.70s -> 3026.74s]  New Notepad.
[3033.34s -> 3035.02s]  Yeah, pretty much every file you can do that.
[3035.02s -> 3035.50s]  It says...
[3035.50s -> 3041.24s]  So I got test, configure, install, share, give access to.
[3041.24s -> 3046.68s]  Like give access to is where open with.
[3046.68s -> 3048.73s]  It usually is.
[3049.45s -> 3056.92s]  What is test?
[3057.48s -> 3069.48s]  What if I just drag it into Notepad?
[3070.79s -> 3071.43s]  Like into that...
[3071.43s -> 3073.83s]  Okay, I thought I had to open it with Notepad.
[3073.83s -> 3075.83s]  I can just drag it into a new Notepad.
[3075.83s -> 3076.55s]  All right, I got it.
[3076.55s -> 3077.35s]  I'm good to go.
[3077.35s -> 3078.62s]  All right, so let's do...
[3079.42s -> 3085.03s]  So I gotta add forced horizontal FOV.
[3085.75s -> 3087.85s]  Force...
[3087.85s -> 3091.74s]  Make sure I spell this shit right.
[3093.14s -> 3099.78s]  Forced, hoars, forced hoars FOV.
[3100.42s -> 3105.03s]  Forced hoars FOV and then in brackets 90.
[3109.61s -> 3116.55s]  Okay, so now how do I get rid of some of the other dumb shit?
[3116.55s -> 3118.07s]  I'm only going to do this once.
[3118.07s -> 3122.10s]  How do I get rid of the stuff on the top and the bottom?
[3122.74s -> 3126.55s]  Forced hoars FOV, forced hoars FOV 90.
[3127.19s -> 3140.78s]  What?
[3140.78s -> 3141.82s]  What are we talking about?
[3141.82s -> 3150.26s]  Oh, unless there's like a...
[3150.26s -> 3151.30s]  Anyone's got an...
[3151.30s -> 3152.18s]  Yeah, phrasing.
[3155.32s -> 3157.24s]  All right, how do I remove the vignette?
[3157.24s -> 3159.37s]  Do I have to do that here too?
[3159.37s -> 3160.33s]  Because I don't see it here.
[3160.89s -> 3162.81s]  I mean, FX level.
[3163.91s -> 3165.43s]  Full dynamic shader path.
[3169.86s -> 3170.34s]  Filter.
[3170.34s -> 3171.30s]  I don't see it here.
[3173.30s -> 3174.02s]  Gamma float.
[3174.58s -> 3181.16s]  Disables.
[3181.16s -> 3181.80s]  There it is.
[3181.80s -> 3183.48s]  Okay, so disable screen board.
[3183.48s -> 3185.48s]  Disable the hand-painted comic boarder.
[3185.48s -> 3188.30s]  Do I have...
[3188.30s -> 3189.02s]  What do I do say?
[3190.06s -> 3190.86s]  Okay, here, look.
[3191.99s -> 3193.27s]  Do I put one in here?
[3200.52s -> 3201.88s]  In the brackets, do I put one?
[3202.60s -> 3224.14s]  Or do I just get rid of the exclamation point?
[3224.14s -> 3225.42s]  Delete the bars.
[3226.14s -> 3227.10s]  Just do what the guide...
[3227.10s -> 3228.54s]  Well, the guide doesn't say...
[3228.54s -> 3229.50s]  It doesn't say anything, does it?
[3230.14s -> 3235.61s]  You can delete this file and run the game to reset the default settings.
[3237.48s -> 3237.88s]  It doesn't...
[3237.88s -> 3238.28s]  It just says...
[3238.28s -> 3242.20s]  There's like I-S-F-I-S-F-I-S-F.
[3243.00s -> 3247.30s]  Delete the exclamation point.
[3247.30s -> 3248.74s]  It doesn't disable it otherwise, okay?
[3249.46s -> 3252.94s]  So, deleting that exclamation point.
[3256.30s -> 3256.86s]  Okay.
[3256.86s -> 3257.42s]  That should work.
[3258.06s -> 3261.77s]  Okay.
[3263.86s -> 3264.98s]  I'm going to save this now.
[3265.62s -> 3278.10s]  Let me make sure it actually saved it.
[3278.74s -> 3285.90s]  Okay.
[3285.90s -> 3287.27s]  Let's open it.
[3287.27s -> 3288.55s]  Let's hope it doesn't break it.
[3289.27s -> 3300.98s]  The joys of running old games on Windows 10.
[3300.98s -> 3301.30s]  Yeah.
[3301.86s -> 3304.20s]  That should be good though.
[3305.14s -> 3306.10s]  Thank you for your patience.
[3315.93s -> 3316.33s]  Coming back.
[3323.19s -> 3323.67s]  Jesus.
[3324.47s -> 3326.25s]  Why?
[3326.89s -> 3335.27s]  This is still a trend that no one seems to want to solve.
[3337.99s -> 3340.95s]  The default FOV was 82, by the way.
[3340.95s -> 3341.27s]  Okay.
[3341.99s -> 3344.58s]  Well, that makes sense.
[3345.22s -> 3348.54s]  Because it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either.
[3349.34s -> 3355.99s]  Okay.
[3355.99s -> 3356.47s]  Here we go.
[3357.34s -> 3357.82s]  Story.
[3359.48s -> 3359.96s]  Continue.
[3361.83s -> 3363.14s]  Did it work?
[3363.14s -> 3364.02s]  Are we good?
[3364.02s -> 3384.38s]  So, was the bastard you were after now riding with the cowboys?
[3384.38s -> 3387.50s]  Roscoe Bob Bryant was his name.
[3387.50s -> 3387.98s]  Oh.
[3387.98s -> 3389.48s]  But no.
[3389.48s -> 3391.88s]  This time it was a different bastard I was after.
[3392.44s -> 3394.68s]  He aforementioned Mr. Ringo.
[3394.68s -> 3397.24s]  And yes, he was working for Old Man Clown.
[3397.24s -> 3398.36s]  Is it read only?
[3402.36s -> 3403.96s]  Set the file to read only.
[3407.62s -> 3409.62s]  Did I add more screen border?
[3413.38s -> 3415.86s]  Did I add another layer to an extra border?
[3419.45s -> 3419.77s]  No.
[3419.77s -> 3420.89s]  I tried to just...
[3420.89s -> 3422.25s]  This is freaking me out now.
[3431.46s -> 3432.18s]  Oh, wait.
[3432.18s -> 3436.47s]  So the FOV may have changed.
[3436.47s -> 3438.23s]  And the border is now showing...
[3438.23s -> 3438.55s]  Okay.
[3440.25s -> 3440.89s]  God damn it.
[3440.89s -> 3441.13s]  All right.
[3442.01s -> 3449.16s]  Just make it nothing but border.
[3453.74s -> 3454.06s]  Whatever.
[3464.12s -> 3468.82s]  All right.
[3468.82s -> 3470.34s]  Still playing on hard, so I gotta remember that.
[3477.05s -> 3478.25s]  Just clip it in OBS.
[3478.25s -> 3480.73s]  Yeah, but that would make the FOV bad for you guys.
[3480.73s -> 3482.25s]  Because it would zoom you guys in.
[3483.21s -> 3485.05s]  So I would change the FOV to 90.
[3485.77s -> 3488.25s]  And then change it back to 80 something.
[3488.89s -> 3490.25s]  Because I have to zoom it in.
[3492.01s -> 3492.97s]  Oh, this is the new shooter.
[3492.97s -> 3493.21s]  Okay.
[3508.86s -> 3514.57s]  I need a rifle for this one.
[3521.10s -> 3522.38s]  And whatever else I had.
[3522.38s -> 3522.86s]  What?
[3522.86s -> 3523.42s]  What?
[3523.42s -> 3525.18s]  The FOV fucked up my video game.
[3525.18s -> 3526.22s]  Those were all headshots.
[3526.22s -> 3526.62s]  All of them.
[3526.62s -> 3527.83s]  Out of nowhere.
[3527.83s -> 3529.83s]  And there never seemed to be an end.
[3529.83s -> 3535.24s]  To the cowboys.
[3535.24s -> 3537.16s]  Did I say they were Apaches?
[3537.16s -> 3541.64s]  I said Clanton's cowboys attacked me Apache style.
[3541.64s -> 3543.00s]  I was in a pitched battle.
[3543.00s -> 3543.40s]  What?
[3543.40s -> 3545.08s]  But I was holding my own against an order.
[3545.08s -> 3545.40s]  Okay.
[3558.14s -> 3558.54s]  Look at that.
[3558.54s -> 3559.02s]  Look at that.
[3559.02s -> 3565.83s]  I was still pretty green.
[3565.83s -> 3566.31s]  Look at that.
[3566.31s -> 3569.27s]  Shooting at anything I could see up in those damn holes.
[3569.27s -> 3574.28s]  Didn't see Ringo.
[3574.28s -> 3574.84s]  I'm gonna die.
[3574.84s -> 3575.32s]  I'm gonna die.
[3575.32s -> 3575.96s]  I'm gonna die.
[3575.96s -> 3578.10s]  He and Roscoe barbed the train.
[3578.10s -> 3579.06s]  I'm gonna die.
[3579.06s -> 3582.33s]  Determined to have revenge.
[3582.33s -> 3593.77s]  But to get to Ringo, I knew I'd have to fast forward.
[3593.77s -> 3594.57s]  Oh.
[3594.57s -> 3596.26s]  Goddamn.
[3596.26s -> 3605.35s]  Unfortunately, I was running out of an example of my relative inexperience as a hundred of men.
[3605.35s -> 3605.99s]  Ammo's right here.
[3605.99s -> 3606.63s]  What are you talking about?
[3607.94s -> 3608.82s]  I got plenty of ammo.
[3609.78s -> 3614.14s]  Oh, no, no.
[3614.14s -> 3614.54s]  Pick up.
[3623.18s -> 3623.66s]  What is?
[3629.59s -> 3631.19s]  This is like too many people.
[3642.70s -> 3643.90s]  Finally, they did it.
[3645.90s -> 3647.10s]  This narration.
[3647.66s -> 3652.26s]  It's on hard mode.
[3652.26s -> 3652.74s]  It's all right.
[3653.46s -> 3653.94s]  I'll get good.
[3653.94s -> 3654.34s]  Don't worry.
[3660.14s -> 3660.46s]  Hold on.
[3660.46s -> 3661.66s]  He's resetting here?
[3664.54s -> 3666.94s]  Why would it zoom in over there?
[3666.94s -> 3667.98s]  I'm looking over here.
[3675.78s -> 3676.42s]  Finally.
[3678.28s -> 3680.12s]  Do you see how many fucking people are here, guys?
[3688.97s -> 3689.85s]  Holy shit.
[3692.76s -> 3693.26s]  What?
[3693.40s -> 3695.64s]  I suddenly spotted a way out of my predicament.
[3704.14s -> 3705.58s]  That was fucking perfect.
[3706.86s -> 3708.87s]  Was I supposed to find that?
[3712.34s -> 3712.82s]  Oh, my God.
[3712.82s -> 3713.46s]  I have no gun.
[3713.46s -> 3714.50s]  I have no gun.
[3714.50s -> 3715.38s]  I have one bullet.
[3741.80s -> 3743.32s]  Why would you turn?
[3744.52s -> 3746.20s]  I'm trying to run away.
[3746.20s -> 3749.24s]  And he like whips his head around and stares at the guy.
[3752.26s -> 3753.30s]  Oh, God damn it.
[3753.30s -> 3754.66s]  I need ammo first.
[3759.69s -> 3760.09s]  Whatever.
[3760.09s -> 3760.41s]  I got...
[3761.05s -> 3767.14s]  What's that shotgun?
[3767.14s -> 3769.46s]  Why do I have one fucking bullet in the shotgun?
[3793.13s -> 3793.85s]  Same guy.
[3793.85s -> 3794.17s]  Yeah.
[3794.17s -> 3794.97s]  Tried to get me again.
[3803.85s -> 3804.25s]  Thank you.
[3804.89s -> 3808.41s]  Billy the Kid's massive dong for the thousand dollars.
[3808.41s -> 3809.21s]  I appreciate it.
[3809.21s -> 3809.77s]  Holy shit.
[3809.77s -> 3811.05s]  That's a lot of money.
[3811.05s -> 3812.01s]  So I just kept running.
[3812.01s -> 3813.45s]  You know, I'm just gonna keep going this way.
[3816.04s -> 3816.54s]  What?
[3821.67s -> 3824.63s]  Was that supposed to just be there or was it supposed to fall down?
[3834.36s -> 3834.68s]  I don't...
[3835.32s -> 3837.45s]  Oh, I have ammo now.
[3840.31s -> 3841.51s]  Oh, it's a joke.
[3841.51s -> 3842.07s]  Oh, okay.
[3842.95s -> 3844.06s]  It's supposed to.
[3845.61s -> 3846.97s]  Unreliable narrator.
[3850.84s -> 3851.34s]  Yep.
[3860.58s -> 3860.90s]  I just...
[3860.90s -> 3862.90s]  I didn't know what it was like.
[3862.90s -> 3864.90s]  Now I'm chasing them with dynamite.
[3865.46s -> 3874.52s]  I got him.
[3874.52s -> 3875.02s]  Okay.
[3879.23s -> 3882.91s]  That was just an explosive New Vegas build.
[3882.91s -> 3883.55s]  That's true.
[3886.68s -> 3887.96s]  I'm just playing Fallout.
[3889.52s -> 3890.08s]  Oh, fuck.
[3904.54s -> 3909.72s]  I really want to get rid of this border.
[3912.30s -> 3912.80s]  Frankie.
[3915.04s -> 3915.84s]  Mean as hell.
[3915.84s -> 3916.48s]  Old man.
[3917.12s -> 3917.62s]  Clampin'.
[3932.44s -> 3934.12s]  Turns out that was a bad idea.
[3934.12s -> 3935.96s]  Because why would you ever announce your position
[3935.96s -> 3937.96s]  and have somebody shoot you with a fucking minigun?
[3952.84s -> 3956.33s]  All right.
[3956.33s -> 3957.05s]  I'm gonna get up there.
[3957.05s -> 3957.85s]  Do I have a rifle?
[3960.14s -> 3961.02s]  Where's the next place to go?
[3965.07s -> 3965.57s]  Over there.
[3978.46s -> 3978.96s]  No!
[3980.35s -> 3981.55s]  I was really, really greedy there.
[3981.55s -> 3982.05s]  It's okay.
[3985.48s -> 3985.88s]  Where...
[3985.88s -> 3986.44s]  Where is he?
[3986.44s -> 3986.94s]  He's up.
[3987.58s -> 3988.54s]  I'm gonna hit him right in the head.
[3988.54s -> 3988.94s]  Watch this.
[3988.94s -> 3989.44s]  Ready?
[4010.65s -> 4014.17s]  That's why you guys all play like Fortnite and Apex and shit like that.
[4014.17s -> 4014.73s]  I figured it out.
[4014.73s -> 4015.23s]  I know why.
[4017.29s -> 4020.65s]  You want to do that long range shot and have it go like bang!
[4021.77s -> 4030.16s]  My hands were off the...
[4030.16s -> 4031.84s]  I didn't have my hands on the keyboard or anything.
[4032.64s -> 4033.60s]  I was hit by...
[4033.60s -> 4034.10s]  Okay.
[4035.26s -> 4036.38s]  I got tanked off on.
[4036.38s -> 4036.88s]  I'm fine.
[4037.87s -> 4038.37s]  I...
[4039.07s -> 4040.19s]  I can't even turn my camera on.
[4040.19s -> 4043.39s]  I was putting my fingers up towards my mouth and talking and moving my hands.
[4044.11s -> 4050.27s]  It's all right.
[4050.27s -> 4050.77s]  I'm right here.
[4055.50s -> 4057.13s]  I don't even...
[4057.13s -> 4058.33s]  I don't know what the fuck that was.
[4059.05s -> 4065.16s]  Can I sneak up around to shoot him in the head?
[4097.56s -> 4098.76s]  I shot him in the head three times.
[4104.86s -> 4105.36s]  No.
[4105.90s -> 4106.46s]  I'm gonna get up there.
[4106.46s -> 4107.58s]  I'm gonna put two in his chest.
[4107.58s -> 4108.08s]  Ready?
[4108.70s -> 4122.80s]  He even pulled his knife out and the gun was still shooting.
[4122.80s -> 4136.24s]  This thing is a turret.
[4147.85s -> 4148.09s]  All right.
[4148.09s -> 4149.45s]  I was gonna do it this way.
[4154.25s -> 4155.53s]  Is he gonna shoot?
[4155.53s -> 4156.91s]  What's he doing?
[4159.31s -> 4160.59s]  What the fuck is he doing?
[4161.31s -> 4170.96s]  Is he being blocked by that one little thing in the middle?
[4187.64s -> 4188.92s]  He's head glitching.
[4195.08s -> 4197.16s]  Why do bullet holes appear on the screen when you get hit?
[4197.16s -> 4198.84s]  Because I'm in a car.
[4198.84s -> 4200.04s]  There's a windshield in front of me.
[4202.27s -> 4204.35s]  I got really, really thick gamer glasses on.
[4204.35s -> 4204.85s]  That's why.
[4224.97s -> 4231.77s]  Okay, headshot.
[4231.77s -> 4233.05s]  Didn't get any nuggets of truth.
[4234.01s -> 4234.51s]  Bad.
[4236.20s -> 4236.44s]  All right.
[4236.44s -> 4236.92s]  Well, hold on.
[4244.60s -> 4245.56s]  I should get some of these.
[4246.20s -> 4251.07s]  If I'm playing on hard mode, then close combat resistance.
[4251.07s -> 4253.07s]  You can't be bulletproof, but you can be more resistant.
[4254.73s -> 4255.45s]  Yeah.
[4255.45s -> 4260.60s]  What's this next one down here?
[4262.35s -> 4263.31s]  Pick your targets faster.
[4263.31s -> 4265.39s]  Your speed of aiming any weapon will be increased by 30%.
[4267.12s -> 4268.24s]  I want this though, too.
[4268.24s -> 4268.80s]  More zoom.
[4269.96s -> 4270.68s]  Yeah.
[4270.68s -> 4271.16s]  Fuck it, dude.
[4271.16s -> 4272.28s]  We're doing this whole game.
[4272.28s -> 4273.40s]  I'm gonna beat this whole game today.
[4274.12s -> 4274.92s]  This game's awesome.
[4275.56s -> 4277.80s]  I want the zoom.
[4283.42s -> 4284.54s]  Yeah, I want this.
[4302.33s -> 4303.93s]  Gonna be a 30-minute stream.
[4307.90s -> 4311.10s]  When I take my first pee break,
[4311.10s -> 4313.90s]  I'm gonna desperately try to remove this border.
[4313.90s -> 4317.23s]  I'm gonna go shove the piss out of me as fast as I can.
[4317.23s -> 4318.75s]  Get back here and try to delete that border.
[4319.61s -> 4320.09s]  Not yet, though.
[4320.09s -> 4320.81s]  I'm not gonna do that now.
[4321.68s -> 4322.18s]  Not yet.
[4333.63s -> 4340.43s]  Okay, only 10 shots?
[4341.55s -> 4343.53s]  What is that bullshit?
[4355.00s -> 4355.40s]  All right.
[4355.40s -> 4357.64s]  This is the point of the game where I stealth.
[4379.71s -> 4381.07s]  Oh, a nice dual-combing.
[4386.56s -> 4389.28s]  What happened there?
[4393.96s -> 4395.16s]  Runner plus 100.
[4408.33s -> 4409.45s]  Look at that reaction time.
[4410.75s -> 4411.79s]  It's fucking inhuman.
[4433.40s -> 4434.04s]  It was on him!
[4447.85s -> 4454.36s]  Oh, that was his death animation.
[4454.36s -> 4455.32s]  It's all right.
[4455.32s -> 4462.65s]  All right, don't use all these bullets.
[4474.36s -> 4474.76s]  Nice.
[4474.76s -> 4475.08s]  All right.
[4475.72s -> 4478.83s]  So what's the sound?
[4479.79s -> 4482.96s]  There's an indicator now that I have that level up.
[4483.52s -> 4489.74s]  Oh, God.
[4492.19s -> 4492.43s]  Was that a...
[4492.43s -> 4496.99s]  There were killers around every corner, all wearing red bandanas.
[4496.99s -> 4499.72s]  That's how the cowboys identified each other.
[4499.72s -> 4500.44s]  What did I fail?
[4500.44s -> 4502.92s]  And I was beginning to wish I had one myself.
[4502.92s -> 4503.32s]  Check this.
[4503.88s -> 4514.52s]  I wasn't about to let Ringo unscathed, and that's what drove me home.
[4514.52s -> 4519.61s]  Come on.
[4519.61s -> 4521.23s]  Come on.
[4521.23s -> 4532.08s]  You say that Ringo was infernal when you saw anyone faster, boy.
[4532.08s -> 4532.72s]  Ooh, ammo.
[4532.72s -> 4533.76s]  It's certainly not wild.
[4533.76s -> 4534.24s]  Whoa.
[4541.96s -> 4542.44s]  Drop it.
[4543.32s -> 4544.20s]  I can't drop that.
[4567.34s -> 4569.18s]  You need to aim at it.
[4569.18s -> 4569.58s]  I did.
[4574.16s -> 4574.88s]  Right in the rope.
[4574.88s -> 4575.36s]  That's all right.
[4580.17s -> 4595.32s]  All right.
[4595.32s -> 4596.60s]  When they get close, it scares me.
[4601.92s -> 4602.96s]  Take over the cowboys.
[4604.08s -> 4608.72s]  Because I, Clanton, was dumber than a box of rocks and a yellow billy to boot.
[4612.33s -> 4613.61s]  Oh, that's full rifle ammo.
[4617.93s -> 4618.57s]  Very cool.
[4618.57s -> 4620.01s]  Make your way through the saw mill.
[4625.24s -> 4627.32s]  Get to the lumber yard and find Curly Bill.
[4628.04s -> 4633.90s]  Was I?
[4633.90s -> 4637.47s]  Taking down the entire gang single-handed.
[4638.03s -> 4639.47s]  Indeed I was, Jack.
[4642.00s -> 4642.88s]  What do I need these for?
[4643.52s -> 4656.64s]  It wasn't easy, as those boys had good cover.
[4658.16s -> 4659.44s]  It actually was kind of easy.
[4662.32s -> 4663.20s]  It was pretty easy.
[4682.41s -> 4683.05s]  Nice.
[4683.05s -> 4694.38s]  All right, I'm gonna save the other ones.
[4694.38s -> 4697.39s]  Don't undermine the storyteller.
[4697.39s -> 4698.19s]  Yeah, I forget.
[4698.19s -> 4699.63s]  He's giving his tale.
[4699.63s -> 4702.20s]  He's telling his tall tale.
[4702.20s -> 4703.16s]  That's not even true.
[4705.31s -> 4707.71s]  He's embellishing on everything he's ever done or ever said.
[4712.25s -> 4712.97s]  Inflating.
[4712.97s -> 4714.33s]  This guy really is a streamer, isn't he?
[4715.05s -> 4723.60s]  All right, let's get up here.
[4729.24s -> 4729.64s]  Uh-oh.
[4738.57s -> 4740.09s]  That collective turnaround.
[4740.09s -> 4741.53s]  That like, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
[4743.36s -> 4743.92s]  Oh, it's fine.
[4762.84s -> 4763.80s]  I didn't get killed by it.
[4763.80s -> 4764.52s]  That's the good thing.
[4766.64s -> 4768.16s]  I accidentally avoided that.
[4768.80s -> 4776.60s]  Why would there be a big barn here?
[4777.24s -> 4777.64s]  Secret?
[4787.00s -> 4787.80s]  Secret?
[4787.80s -> 4792.08s]  I don't think there's any...
[4792.08s -> 4792.80s]  Wait.
[4792.80s -> 4794.24s]  That sounded like a secret.
[4794.24s -> 4804.27s]  I was Curly Bill.
[4804.27s -> 4805.55s]  Did you see him?
[4805.55s -> 4807.69s]  How'd you get to that, Ben?
[4807.69s -> 4808.17s]  Patience.
[4808.73s -> 4811.32s]  I'm painting a picture here.
[4811.96s -> 4817.90s]  It was this beautiful waterfall in a crystal clear stream that led to a verdant valley
[4817.90s -> 4819.10s]  that was truly...
[4819.10s -> 4820.94s]  Consider your picture painted.
[4820.94s -> 4822.06s]  What happened next?
[4822.06s -> 4825.90s]  Well, finally the bastards that were still alive made a last stand.
[4826.78s -> 4827.47s]  How does...
[4827.47s -> 4827.95s]  Let me see.
[4833.60s -> 4833.84s]  No.
[4844.09s -> 4844.33s]  No.
[4844.89s -> 4846.33s]  I'm gonna keep what I have.
[4847.05s -> 4849.05s]  All right.
[4849.05s -> 4850.25s]  Last stand incoming.
[4850.97s -> 4867.48s]  Curly Bill in here?
[4868.04s -> 4876.83s]  What the fuck?
[4876.83s -> 4877.07s]  Ow.
[4877.79s -> 4882.28s]  Wait, what am I doing?
[4883.00s -> 4884.52s]  Did I just go...
[4884.52s -> 4884.84s]  What?
[4884.84s -> 4885.80s]  Did I just ruin everything?
[4886.36s -> 4891.16s]  Curly Bill, Johnny Ringo, and his compadres took off into the lumber yard.
[4891.16s -> 4891.40s]  Okay.
[4891.40s -> 4896.44s]  I guess I was just supposed to...
[4896.44s -> 4897.88s]  No, here comes another one of these.
[4899.84s -> 4902.56s]  Takes a shot before he takes a swig.
[4903.20s -> 4909.40s]  Defeat Curly Bill.
[4916.54s -> 4918.06s]  Oh, that is Curly Bill right there.
[4921.98s -> 4923.53s]  Oh, Jesus.
[4924.33s -> 4933.02s]  There's a Metal Gear Solid boss that's just like this.
[4933.02s -> 4933.74s]  It's freaking me out.
[4934.54s -> 4951.44s]  I gotta...
[4966.78s -> 4967.10s]  Ow.
[4968.48s -> 4969.44s]  Oh, God.
[4969.44s -> 4970.24s]  What?
[4970.24s -> 4970.72s]  Which way?
[4975.47s -> 4976.83s]  This is fucking loony toons fight.
[4977.47s -> 4980.70s]  We're both aiming really close and missing.
[4985.28s -> 4985.60s]  Ow.
[5001.13s -> 5002.17s]  That scream.
[5003.29s -> 5004.89s]  He's like, no, please.
[5019.96s -> 5020.60s]  Where?
[5020.60s -> 5022.03s]  That wasn't even him.
[5024.27s -> 5024.59s]  Fuck.
[5028.27s -> 5028.59s]  Damn it.
[5035.53s -> 5035.69s]  Oh.
[5052.88s -> 5053.36s]  Got it.
[5070.27s -> 5070.75s]  Indeed.
[5071.47s -> 5075.55s]  Took me a few months before I finally tracked his ass to West Turkey Creek Canyon.
[5076.67s -> 5085.61s]  This whole story is being told out of order and incorrectly.
[5090.68s -> 5093.71s]  Next in line to take over.
[5095.05s -> 5095.85s]  Johnny Ringo.
[5096.41s -> 5106.09s]  That's incredible, sir.
[5106.09s -> 5107.95s]  I always thought that Doc Holliday was...
[5107.95s -> 5108.99s]  Shut the fuck up.
[5108.99s -> 5109.87s]  I'm trying to concentrate.
[5110.59s -> 5115.08s]  Get me killed, you fucking idiot.
[5115.64s -> 5121.87s]  We'll talk later.
[5140.84s -> 5141.92s]  All right.
[5141.92s -> 5142.96s]  Let me be real with you guys.
[5144.17s -> 5145.72s]  Back...
[5145.72s -> 5151.36s]  That's probably how all these duels ended.
[5151.36s -> 5151.92s]  Yeah, I know.
[5151.92s -> 5153.52s]  It's like, oh, the story.
[5153.52s -> 5154.00s]  Here it comes.
[5154.00s -> 5155.76s]  It pulls it out, shoots him.
[5156.48s -> 5158.35s]  Like, these guys probably got shot.
[5158.35s -> 5159.31s]  These bullets were small.
[5159.31s -> 5160.35s]  The guns were fucked up.
[5160.35s -> 5161.31s]  They jammed all the time.
[5161.31s -> 5163.77s]  They didn't work half the time.
[5163.77s -> 5165.21s]  These guys are probably lying on the ground,
[5165.21s -> 5168.25s]  just shooting back and forth with each other until one of them died.
[5168.25s -> 5172.76s]  Half the bullets didn't come out.
[5172.76s -> 5176.41s]  They're probably like, oh, fuck.
[5176.41s -> 5177.45s]  And the other guy just shot.
[5177.45s -> 5178.09s]  Hits the other guy.
[5178.09s -> 5178.89s]  They both fall down.
[5178.89s -> 5180.57s]  They crawl off of that gun, shooting at each other.
[5180.57s -> 5209.12s]  Well, sir, I always thought that Doc...
[5209.12s -> 5209.62s]  Damn it.
[5210.26s -> 5213.18s]  This is, you gotta...
[5213.18s -> 5214.62s]  You gotta keep the hand.
[5215.42s -> 5218.58s]  You gotta keep the hand.
[5220.02s -> 5221.54s]  It's fucking hard.
[5221.54s -> 5225.92s]  Because they both move at different speeds.
[5227.20s -> 5228.08s]  Stop talking!
[5238.77s -> 5239.27s]  Oh!
[5239.73s -> 5240.42s]  It's gonna...
[5240.42s -> 5241.14s]  I'm gonna fucking lose again.
[5246.05s -> 5247.49s]  This is fucking...
[5247.49s -> 5248.85s]  This is really difficult.
[5261.30s -> 5265.14s]  Sir, I always thought that Doc Holliday was the one that killed him.
[5265.14s -> 5280.60s]  Got you.
[5280.98s -> 5282.30s]  Sorry, Dad.
[5282.30s -> 5287.76s]  The legend ain't always true.
[5287.76s -> 5289.28s]  That didn't even happen at all.
[5289.28s -> 5290.08s]  Let's rewind.
[5290.88s -> 5299.57s]  No nuggets at her.
[5299.57s -> 5300.21s]  This is bad.
[5300.93s -> 5303.38s]  All right, I said I wanted this.
[5304.18s -> 5304.74s]  Steady aim.
[5304.74s -> 5306.50s]  Additional zoom while aiming.
[5306.50s -> 5310.46s]  Got it.
[5310.46s -> 5311.50s]  No nuggets at all either.
[5311.50s -> 5312.00s]  Yeah.
[5312.00s -> 5312.62s]  Dude, it's too bad.
[5317.31s -> 5318.83s]  That's incredible, sir!
[5318.83s -> 5319.63s]  Now, quiet, quiet.
[5319.63s -> 5320.75s]  I'm trying to remember.
[5321.47s -> 5325.60s]  Trying to remember how fun that was.
[5330.46s -> 5331.02s]  Good perk.
[5331.02s -> 5331.98s]  What would it mean?
[5331.98s -> 5335.42s]  I was paid a healthy bounty for Ringo and Curly Bill.
[5335.42s -> 5338.38s]  And realized it was real money to be made.
[5338.38s -> 5341.25s]  That's why I went after Henry Plummer.
[5341.25s -> 5344.48s]  There's water in that bottle, Grandpa.
[5344.48s -> 5346.40s]  You can stop pretending to be drunk.
[5346.40s -> 5353.26s]  Be the sheriff who augmented his income by shaking down miners and robbing gold shipments.
[5353.26s -> 5354.46s]  That's the one.
[5354.46s -> 5360.90s]  That gang has thieving outlaws called the Innocents.
[5360.90s -> 5363.14s]  So it's true that you went toe-to-toe with him?
[5363.86s -> 5365.70s]  Indeed I did, son.
[5365.70s -> 5366.66s]  Indeed I did.
[5368.54s -> 5369.34s]  Smoking inside.
[5370.54s -> 5372.99s]  It's illegal now.
[5373.95s -> 5385.17s]  Sounds like you're doing the voices.
[5386.37s -> 5387.81s]  Maybe in another lifetime.
[5388.37s -> 5394.26s]  I knew I needed resources if I was going to track down Roscoe Bob Bryant.
[5394.26s -> 5397.06s]  And hunting Plummer looked like a good way to get rich quick.
[5399.42s -> 5403.26s]  As the local vigilantes exposed him as leader of the bandit.
[5403.26s -> 5405.50s]  And put a generous price on his head.
[5406.78s -> 5412.74s]  Plummer rallied his gang to plunder one last gold mine before making their escape.
[5412.74s -> 5414.82s]  And that's where I thought I'd find him.
[5414.82s -> 5415.22s]  This way.
[5423.49s -> 5424.53s]  People are going to be upset about it.
[5424.53s -> 5426.45s]  I got points for it.
[5428.53s -> 5429.01s]  Hold on.
[5429.01s -> 5429.97s]  This is like secrets.
[5430.69s -> 5436.35s]  How far can I go?
[5447.84s -> 5449.28s]  You're leaving the story.
[5457.49s -> 5458.05s]  Look, okay.
[5458.05s -> 5461.04s]  Red Dead was really fun.
[5461.68s -> 5470.00s]  But I would love a current gen western shooter.
[5470.00s -> 5479.31s]  They don't really exist anymore.
[5479.87s -> 5488.42s]  Well, there's a nugget of somewhere nearby.
[5488.42s -> 5489.06s]  Take secret.
[5489.86s -> 5492.42s]  There's a bunch of shit in here too.
[5493.87s -> 5494.11s]  Cool.
[5495.50s -> 5496.54s]  A lot of weapons.
[5498.54s -> 5499.26s]  Shotgun.
[5499.26s -> 5499.90s]  What's that called?
[5499.90s -> 5500.46s]  A ranger.
[5500.46s -> 5502.46s]  I don't think I shouldn't take any of these.
[5503.42s -> 5506.99s]  Yeah, Red Dead is...
[5507.79s -> 5508.67s]  That's explosive.
[5510.35s -> 5511.15s]  Red Dead's great.
[5512.83s -> 5516.27s]  But I like being able to actually aim one-to-one shoot.
[5516.27s -> 5519.18s]  And, you know, because Red Dead in all...
[5519.18s -> 5521.34s]  I mean, Rockstar makes great video games.
[5521.34s -> 5526.48s]  But one thing that they don't really do that well is like the combat portion.
[5526.48s -> 5531.57s]  Because when you just hold down left trigger, you just...
[5532.53s -> 5536.53s]  And you just have to...
[5536.53s -> 5538.85s]  It just auto attaches to people.
[5540.05s -> 5542.85s]  I know you can turn it off, but it's kind of detrimental to your experience.
[5545.23s -> 5547.55s]  And you're like, yeah, well, what about PC?
[5547.55s -> 5548.19s]  That game...
[5548.19s -> 5549.95s]  Is that game ever going to even release on PC?
[5558.22s -> 5559.74s]  Yeah, and you can just turn it off.
[5559.74s -> 5560.54s]  But like the game...
[5561.26s -> 5563.63s]  The game's a kind of nature.
[5570.50s -> 5576.96s]  It's there, but it's not smooth.
[5578.40s -> 5580.00s]  Yeah, it exists.
[5580.96s -> 5581.84s]  It does exist.
[5582.64s -> 5583.20s]  What is it?
[5585.39s -> 5586.43s]  Where the fuck were you?
[5598.82s -> 5601.70s]  The game is clearly intended for auto-aim, so without it, it's even worse.
[5604.74s -> 5606.66s]  Yeah, to an extent.
[5609.34s -> 5612.30s]  It is like hard to turn that off and aim with a controller.
[5612.30s -> 5615.34s]  Especially with how some people's heads just kind of poke up and...
[5616.32s -> 5616.72s]  Can be...
[5616.72s -> 5617.60s]  It's not very smooth.
[5619.30s -> 5620.18s]  Secrets.
[5620.18s -> 5623.28s]  I gotta go that way.
[5623.28s -> 5623.92s]  What about over here?
[5631.30s -> 5631.94s]  I don't think so.
[5639.79s -> 5640.27s]  Secret?
[5662.21s -> 5662.45s]  Well...
[5662.45s -> 5664.61s]  I knew that dynamite wasn't mine.
[5664.61s -> 5667.01s]  So I decided the polite thing would be to return it.
[5676.80s -> 5679.44s]  I mean, this is the shitload of it, so why not just take a munch and play with it?
[5681.26s -> 5684.70s]  It was the biggest gold rush since Sutter's mill in 48.
[5685.50s -> 5689.26s]  Unfortunately, prospectors weren't the only ones drawn to those riches.
[5689.26s -> 5689.98s]  He's like, hey!
[5691.49s -> 5692.53s]  Fuck you, don't do that.
[5704.03s -> 5704.67s]  Anybody else?
[5705.31s -> 5707.17s]  Those that ran with Plumber.
[5707.17s -> 5711.23s]  They're folks I knew from town.
[5711.23s -> 5712.59s]  Greed and easy pickings.
[5715.95s -> 5716.99s]  Try shooting...
[5716.99s -> 5717.63s]  Oh god.
[5721.06s -> 5722.58s]  James, who worked in the stable.
[5723.22s -> 5729.04s]  I'm in Jeremiah Barber, the butcher's son.
[5729.04s -> 5730.40s]  These are people that you should follow.
[5730.40s -> 5732.24s]  He's giving you his list of like other streamer friends.
[5732.24s -> 5733.76s]  Four various citizens with a double life.
[5733.76s -> 5743.76s]  Of course, they're all in the bloody fields of Shiloh and Antietam.
[5746.88s -> 5747.44s]  Oh fuck.
[5748.72s -> 5749.20s]  Not good.
[5749.92s -> 5757.15s]  That son of a bitch pretended to be tough while stealing them blind with the hug.
[5757.15s -> 5761.39s]  He set up a defensive perimeter which I had no idea how to breach.
[5761.39s -> 5766.14s]  He was a desperate individual.
[5766.86s -> 5773.90s]  In way, I was damn stubborn and stupid to realize.
[5773.90s -> 5779.68s]  Panics for a second.
[5779.68s -> 5788.70s]  That's the kind of death we've seen as there were barrels of gunpowder.
[5788.70s -> 5789.50s]  What was that?
[5789.50s -> 5791.66s]  I thought I was some kind of hero.
[5791.66s -> 5797.20s]  Okay.
[5797.66s -> 5806.90s]  I finally made it past and headed on to meet my destiny.
[5809.34s -> 5813.01s]  All right, so is there a person over there?
[5813.01s -> 5813.51s]  No.
[5813.97s -> 5818.78s]  But first, I had something I needed to figure out.
[5819.50s -> 5820.00s]  Uh oh.
[5820.54s -> 5821.18s]  A puzzle.
[5821.82s -> 5824.70s]  I had a few ideas on how to get into that mine.
[5824.70s -> 5828.19s]  Once I made my decision, I knew there was no turning back.
[5829.07s -> 5832.03s]  So my first thought was to enter the nearest mine portal.
[5832.67s -> 5833.63s]  I saw an entrance.
[5836.67s -> 5839.07s]  I feel like he's telling the story, but he has a big whiteboard.
[5839.07s -> 5840.27s]  The quickest way in.
[5840.27s -> 5841.79s]  And he's drawing all this for them.
[5841.79s -> 5842.75s]  More dangerous.
[5842.75s -> 5845.23s]  And he races as he goes, actually over this way.
[5845.23s -> 5847.15s]  Enemy pickets posted along the way.
[5847.15s -> 5862.30s]  You can't beat the innocents.
[5862.30s -> 5871.52s]  All right, we got what's in here.
[5872.69s -> 5873.25s]  Ranger.
[5873.97s -> 5880.35s]  Did dead guy say that?
[5881.57s -> 5882.61s]  Should I get the shotgun?
[5884.85s -> 5887.33s]  I'm gonna take a shotgun.
[5887.97s -> 5892.40s]  And then is there a secret in here somewhere?
[5893.04s -> 5898.80s]  Who the fuck is shooting me?
[5900.56s -> 5901.06s]  Okay.
[5901.60s -> 5903.04s]  I didn't know there was a hole in the ceiling.
[5903.04s -> 5905.12s]  It's easy to get all turned around.
[5905.12s -> 5921.36s]  Do I take the ranger?
[5921.36s -> 5922.40s]  Is the ranger better than what I have?
[5933.95s -> 5935.07s]  How do you tell which one's better?
[5935.79s -> 5939.87s]  The inlets, the sick shooter has a star next to it.
[5941.89s -> 5943.01s]  That means it's better, right?
[5943.65s -> 5946.32s]  Just a powerful revolver.
[5949.63s -> 5951.07s]  Yeah, I'll stick with what I got.
[5951.15s -> 5962.53s]  That confusing maze of corridors wouldn't even be the worst of it.
[5966.24s -> 5966.74s]  Rifle.
[5967.68s -> 5970.62s]  Come on, no secret anywhere in here.
[5971.34s -> 5973.02s]  Give me the experience.
[5973.02s -> 5973.52s]  What the hell?
[5974.14s -> 5978.34s]  Hello?
[5981.58s -> 5983.42s]  They really want me to have that rifle, don't they?
[5984.54s -> 5985.82s]  But I'm not gonna take it.
[5992.61s -> 5993.41s]  Deepest hell.
[5993.41s -> 6000.82s]  A single stumble or misstep can easily end in a deadly plunge to oblivion.
[6002.18s -> 6002.82s]  Deadly pl-
[6002.82s -> 6003.46s]  So I gotta be careful.
[6003.46s -> 6004.74s]  They can't just, like, w-
[6004.74s -> 6005.46s]  E to climb.
[6009.09s -> 6009.73s]  Wait.
[6009.73s -> 6017.87s]  Okay, I gotta be careful.
[6019.28s -> 6020.88s]  Fall damage is pretty severe.
[6021.68s -> 6025.46s]  So we're gonna do something like Donkey Kong?
[6025.46s -> 6026.58s]  A nugget is somewhere nearby.
[6032.66s -> 6033.30s]  Well, where is it?
[6033.94s -> 6039.97s]  A nugget is nearby.
[6039.97s -> 6056.46s]  It's right there.
[6060.67s -> 6065.62s]  Got it.
[6065.62s -> 6068.40s]  Level up.
[6068.40s -> 6071.68s]  Okay, do I keep going through here or do I do a different tree?
[6071.68s -> 6072.96s]  I feel like I need to do a different-
[6072.96s -> 6075.20s]  Okay, this is dual-weld revolvers.
[6075.20s -> 6077.20s]  Grab two revolvers and give them hell.
[6077.20s -> 6079.95s]  Press a wheel up or three to dual-weld.
[6086.10s -> 6086.60s]  Yeah.
[6086.98s -> 6090.48s]  I mean, I kinda have to do that.
[6091.44s -> 6094.56s]  Can't play a game about cowboys and not dual-weld revolvers.
[6096.45s -> 6097.81s]  Well, I'll just take two of these.
[6098.69s -> 6104.67s]  Okay, so you just-
[6106.14s -> 6107.98s]  Bright mouse is still zoom.
[6109.33s -> 6109.89s]  All right, cool.
[6113.09s -> 6114.05s]  Let me get down here.
[6134.32s -> 6135.12s]  I pressed D-
[6135.12s -> 6136.32s]  I pressed A and it didn't-
[6136.32s -> 6136.82s]  I-
[6142.16s -> 6142.80s]  Oh, okay.
[6142.80s -> 6144.80s]  So that wasn't a quick time event where you had to-
[6144.80s -> 6145.76s]  I had to hold A.
[6149.42s -> 6152.62s]  I thought I had to just press, like, A and move out of the way.
[6152.62s -> 6153.18s]  I didn't know it was-
[6153.82s -> 6161.84s]  I thought it was a quick time event.
[6161.84s -> 6162.34s]  Nugget!
[6165.02s -> 6165.66s]  But where?
[6166.30s -> 6183.84s]  What the hell is this?
[6186.70s -> 6187.20s]  What?
[6191.17s -> 6191.67s]  No.
[6192.29s -> 6193.25s]  No, come on.
[6193.89s -> 6194.39s]  All right, good.
[6194.93s -> 6202.05s]  It's like I was inside of this wall.
[6202.77s -> 6205.18s]  Can I get up there?
[6234.03s -> 6235.31s]  Maybe- Is it down here?
[6244.38s -> 6245.98s]  That's- Why would you do that here?
[6245.98s -> 6246.78s]  Why would you do that here?
[6252.48s -> 6253.12s]  I thought-
[6254.08s -> 6256.48s]  We didn't even get to see the domino effect!
[6262.00s -> 6262.72s]  You were saying-
[6262.72s -> 6263.68s]  I- I'm saying-
[6264.78s -> 6266.94s]  I'm saying I didn't even get to see, like, the-
[6270.46s -> 6271.50s]  He's not gonna do shit.
[6275.62s -> 6276.18s]  Maybe you are.
[6277.22s -> 6280.50s]  It's gonna hit a barrel behind me.
[6282.18s -> 6283.94s]  Why are you standing on them?
[6283.94s -> 6285.22s]  You're just gonna kill us all.
[6285.94s -> 6290.19s]  Where the fuck did he go?
[6292.30s -> 6292.80s]  Okay.
[6293.50s -> 6297.25s]  Did he blend in camouflage with the game?
[6297.25s -> 6298.69s]  I- Did I not see him?
[6299.33s -> 6301.25s]  How did I- I- I- I'm fucking blind.
[6301.25s -> 6301.81s]  I have to be.
[6309.47s -> 6315.94s]  Murderer.
[6315.94s -> 6316.50s]  Eat shit.
[6317.22s -> 6317.72s]  Okay.
[6318.42s -> 6318.98s]  There it is.
[6318.98s -> 6319.46s]  It's in here.
[6330.80s -> 6331.12s]  Okay.
[6331.12s -> 6332.72s]  So now that I'm not out there, we can do it.
[6353.34s -> 6358.00s]  So you gotta- So you gotta run.
[6358.00s -> 6358.56s]  I get it.
[6359.36s -> 6370.74s]  Could've been secret.
[6371.46s -> 6374.64s]  Am I supposed to jump off?
[6375.62s -> 6376.50s]  What the fuck?
[6387.95s -> 6389.79s]  Wait, what happened?
[6389.79s -> 6391.07s]  What did I do wrong?
[6392.03s -> 6393.55s]  Oh, that's scripted.
[6393.55s -> 6394.35s]  Scripted.
[6394.35s -> 6394.83s]  Scripted.
[6398.40s -> 6398.96s]  Scripted.
[6399.60s -> 6400.40s]  That didn't happen.
[6402.13s -> 6405.81s]  For him to have just been, like, drinking fucking Nyquil again.
[6408.91s -> 6410.75s]  I was gonna say this, no way.
[6428.50s -> 6429.38s]  Why is he saying that?
[6437.04s -> 6452.69s]  I can't tell what's scripted and what's not scripted.
[6453.82s -> 6455.50s]  I just hit my face on that board.
[6457.17s -> 6459.01s]  My entire front row of teeth are gone.
[6476.21s -> 6478.05s]  Implying this guy had any front teeth.
[6489.10s -> 6490.46s]  When am I gonna change the FOV?
[6490.46s -> 6493.38s]  I tried to do it before and it didn't work.
[6493.38s -> 6495.94s]  So when I take my pee break here after this level,
[6495.94s -> 6497.20s]  I'm gonna try to do it again.
[6509.71s -> 6510.27s]  A choice.
[6513.63s -> 6518.59s]  Is this an elevator?
[6519.23s -> 6529.25s]  Nugget.
[6529.25s -> 6535.38s]  The elevator's boring.
[6537.92s -> 6539.44s]  No, the elevator's boring.
[6540.08s -> 6540.88s]  I'm climbing the ladder.
[6541.52s -> 6552.69s]  Do I have to race this thing?
[6552.69s -> 6554.77s]  There's the- I told you this was a good idea.
[6555.57s -> 6559.10s]  Do I have to beat this?
[6559.74s -> 6563.47s]  How is a ladder less boring?
[6564.11s -> 6565.31s]  I don't know, at least I don't have to-
[6565.31s -> 6566.03s]  Who's shooting me?
[6566.67s -> 6571.90s]  Do you see anybody here?
[6572.54s -> 6575.36s]  Oh, they're already up there.
[6575.36s -> 6576.64s]  They took the elevator, okay.
[6577.44s -> 6598.98s]  I just fucked up my accuracy for the whole level.
[6598.98s -> 6600.26s]  God damn it, but I had to do that.
[6606.10s -> 6608.26s]  All right, let's take the elevator back down.
[6608.26s -> 6612.03s]  That wasn't even a cool choice.
[6612.03s -> 6614.19s]  It was just walk or don't walk.
[6617.70s -> 6618.58s]  Ferris wheel, okay.
[6627.10s -> 6627.50s]  Uh oh.
[6628.22s -> 6635.39s]  I don't care about accuracy anymore.
[6637.70s -> 6638.82s]  I don't have my rifle.
[6645.84s -> 6646.56s]  Oh, Nevada?
[6647.28s -> 6648.24s]  Oh, Nevada?
[6650.37s -> 6651.25s]  I've been there before.
[6651.97s -> 6658.77s]  Okay, so find Henry Plummer.
[6658.77s -> 6660.77s]  Is that him?
[6661.33s -> 6675.07s]  Can I jump over this?
[6676.82s -> 6677.22s]  I guess.
[6678.34s -> 6680.37s]  There might be a secret down here.
[6686.74s -> 6687.38s]  Oh, shit.
[6687.94s -> 6695.26s]  So there's Mr. Plummer.
[6697.95s -> 6699.87s]  He's dynamite enthusiast.
[6700.51s -> 6707.65s]  I got four to four.
[6707.65s -> 6708.13s]  Oh, okay, cool.
[6726.64s -> 6727.20s]  What?
[6727.20s -> 6728.32s]  Did somebody stab me?
[6728.32s -> 6758.46s]  Did I step on a fucking bear trap?
[6758.46s -> 6759.34s]  What the fuck?
[6759.98s -> 6782.62s]  No, don't kill me, please.
[6787.42s -> 6788.14s]  It's gonna get him.
[6788.78s -> 6789.82s]  Where's the dynamite?
[6790.38s -> 6791.95s]  I threw dynamite.
[6807.18s -> 6807.90s]  Nice.
[6807.90s -> 6813.84s]  I can't see.
[6813.84s -> 6814.96s]  Oh, no.
[6814.96s -> 6815.52s]  Okay, don't.
[6816.80s -> 6818.08s]  I need that rifle.
[6818.08s -> 6818.96s]  I don't have the rifle.
[6819.52s -> 6824.22s]  I need that rifle.
[6825.30s -> 6827.97s]  No dual welding.
[6827.97s -> 6829.81s]  And no like fucking comedy throws.
[6830.53s -> 6832.24s]  Where is he?
[6832.24s -> 6837.92s]  Oh, shit.
[6837.92s -> 6838.56s]  No, this is the...
[6838.56s -> 6839.92s]  Okay, I'm starting at the second phase.
[6840.48s -> 6852.53s]  He's back.
[6852.53s -> 6856.83s]  Shit, there he is.
[6856.83s -> 6873.06s]  Oh my god, he's throwing my...
[6873.86s -> 6876.37s]  Jesus Christ.
[6876.37s -> 6876.61s]  What?
[6892.54s -> 6897.10s]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[6897.10s -> 6904.45s]  I'm trying to shoot them.
[6904.45s -> 6905.65s]  I'm trying to shoot them.
[6909.76s -> 6910.24s]  Where's the...
[6910.24s -> 6911.68s]  Is this another person shooting me?
[6912.40s -> 6937.22s]  No, no.
[6937.22s -> 6938.70s]  Which way is it going?
[6938.70s -> 6945.15s]  Oh, god.
[6945.15s -> 6946.03s]  Oh, god.
[6946.03s -> 6946.59s]  Oh, my god.
[6946.59s -> 6947.87s]  What's doing that?
[6947.87s -> 6948.75s]  Holy shit.
[6949.79s -> 6951.07s]  Is he throwing three at a time?
[6953.73s -> 6955.81s]  Who the fuck is shooting me?
[6956.77s -> 6957.97s]  I'm swear to god.
[6957.97s -> 6959.09s]  It's this guy.
[6959.09s -> 6959.65s]  Jesus.
[6962.59s -> 6963.47s]  Oh, this is it.
[6975.60s -> 6976.40s]  I didn't hit him.
[6976.40s -> 6976.72s]  Fuck.
[6977.73s -> 6984.27s]  Oh, why do I have the shotgun?
[6989.34s -> 6990.94s]  If I had my rifle, this would be...
[6992.06s -> 6992.78s]  Can I get you?
[6992.78s -> 6993.90s]  Oh, you're too far away.
[6994.62s -> 6996.77s]  Why do I even have this thing?
[6997.33s -> 7013.34s]  I said no to the rifle and took the shotgun.
[7013.34s -> 7015.98s]  I'm only going to use the rifle and the pistol.
[7018.85s -> 7020.37s]  I have one gun right now.
[7032.26s -> 7032.90s]  Look at this shit.
[7041.78s -> 7042.98s]  Don't let him collapse on me.
[7047.87s -> 7048.83s]  Where is he?
[7048.83s -> 7057.76s]  Where's the other guy?
[7057.76s -> 7062.02s]  There he is.
[7062.02s -> 7062.98s]  Oh, fuck.
[7062.98s -> 7063.46s]  Oh, my god.
[7065.06s -> 7076.91s]  Where the fuck did he go?
[7095.71s -> 7102.22s]  Oh, shit.
[7117.89s -> 7119.57s]  This is supposed to be a chill stream.
[7119.57s -> 7125.57s]  No, it still is.
[7125.57s -> 7126.93s]  Told you I fucked up the accuracy.
[7126.93s -> 7127.17s]  Bad.
[7129.50s -> 7129.82s]  All right.
[7129.82s -> 7130.22s]  One level.
[7130.22s -> 7130.70s]  Where we going?
[7130.70s -> 7131.50s]  We can go up here.
[7132.14s -> 7136.75s]  Revolver ammo capacity increased.
[7137.39s -> 7139.18s]  100% more ammo.
[7140.64s -> 7142.56s]  Don't stop your killing frenzy so soon.
[7142.56s -> 7145.28s]  Your combo meter will stay active for longer.
[7145.28s -> 7148.08s]  Better chaining and longer combos earn more experience.
[7149.89s -> 7150.21s]  Yeah.
[7153.49s -> 7154.53s]  Hydrate, hydrate.
[7154.53s -> 7154.93s]  I'm all right.
[7154.93s -> 7155.33s]  I'm good.
[7155.89s -> 7157.01s]  I've had a drink writer.
[7159.95s -> 7162.19s]  In before everybody says coffee doesn't count.
[7162.19s -> 7162.51s]  Okay.
[7163.23s -> 7165.84s]  But you suck at combos.
[7166.40s -> 7169.70s]  Don't ever say that again.
[7171.94s -> 7172.26s]  All right.
[7172.26s -> 7173.22s]  Here's what I'm going to go.
[7173.22s -> 7174.34s]  I'm going to go grab another water.
[7174.90s -> 7176.58s]  Even though there was never a water here.
[7176.58s -> 7177.14s]  It was coffee.
[7177.14s -> 7178.42s]  I'm going to grab a coffee and a water.
[7181.02s -> 7183.18s]  I'm going to try to fix the FOV thing again.
[7183.98s -> 7185.42s]  So we'll do our first little pee break.
[7186.06s -> 7187.74s]  So I'm going to try to go very fast
[7187.74s -> 7190.29s]  so I can sprint back up here
[7190.29s -> 7194.66s]  to be able to fix, to try to get this done.
[7195.92s -> 7199.20s]  I'm going to like flat foot run.
[7203.68s -> 7205.76s]  John Wesley Harden.
[7205.76s -> 7207.04s]  So that's where I went.
[7208.51s -> 7209.55s]  We're in Kansas.
[7210.11s -> 7211.15s]  This game's really fun though.
[7211.15s -> 7211.79s]  I like it a lot.
[7212.67s -> 7213.39s]  No reason.
[7214.03s -> 7216.19s]  Was Harden as fast as Ringo?
[7216.19s -> 7217.31s]  Ringo was fast.
[7217.87s -> 7221.23s]  But John Wesley was as fast as the devil himself.
[7227.46s -> 7227.70s]  Yeah.
[7227.70s -> 7231.30s]  I want my heel, my bottom,
[7231.30s -> 7233.22s]  and my toes to hit the ground at the same time.
[7233.78s -> 7234.26s]  So it's like.
[7239.38s -> 7252.30s]  So like, you know, I'll give you an example like
[7253.10s -> 7256.69s]  but times 50.
[7257.33s -> 7260.62s]  All right.
[7260.62s -> 7261.26s]  I'm going to get here.
[7261.26s -> 7262.86s]  I'm going to exit the game.
[7262.86s -> 7263.66s]  I'll be right back.
[7267.38s -> 7268.02s]  One second here.
[7278.90s -> 7279.14s]  All right.
[7279.14s -> 7280.34s]  I'll be right back.
[7280.34s -> 7286.74s]  Get some water
[7287.38s -> 7290.08s]  and I'm going to run as fast as I can back here.
[7294.32s -> 7294.88s]  Exit game.
[7295.52s -> 7295.92s]  All right.
[7296.48s -> 7297.44s]  Let me try this one more time.
[7298.32s -> 7299.84s]  Somebody was linking stuff.
[7302.46s -> 7303.18s]  What were you linking?
[7313.25s -> 7313.73s]  There it is.
[7317.41s -> 7317.81s]  Okay.
[7318.77s -> 7325.76s]  Go to the configuration file.
[7326.48s -> 7328.62s]  Would you look at that?
[7329.34s -> 7332.94s]  I might be able to do this for a second before I leave.
[7333.50s -> 7350.19s]  Local data.
[7350.19s -> 7353.30s]  How come I can't get into this folder now?
[7363.54s -> 7364.18s]  It's percent.
[7364.18s -> 7365.30s]  Local data percent, right?
[7365.86s -> 7367.62s]  What did I do?
[7367.62s -> 7373.20s]  What the fuck did I do?
[7373.76s -> 7376.16s]  Local app data, right?
[7382.40s -> 7382.96s]  Okay.
[7382.96s -> 7385.70s]  Go get yourself something to drink.
[7385.70s -> 7387.74s]  I'll be right back.
[7387.74s -> 7388.54s]  See you in.
[7388.54s -> 7390.37s]  I'm just going to sprint.
[7390.37s -> 7391.86s]  See you in a minute.
[7391.86s -> 7526.46s]  So quick question.
[7528.69s -> 7529.57s]  I'm still here.
[7529.57s -> 7530.37s]  Just getting this done.
[7531.09s -> 7536.16s]  So this video file, when I opened it again,
[7536.16s -> 7537.84s]  the changes I made were gone.
[7538.40s -> 7539.26s]  Okay.
[7541.10s -> 7545.26s]  So the things that I put in on opening after closing the game are gone.
[7547.78s -> 7549.38s]  Should I make this read only?
[7549.38s -> 7551.46s]  And yeah, I'm going to have to make the video file,
[7551.46s -> 7557.62s]  this file here actually read only, right?
[7557.62s -> 7559.14s]  Okay.
[7559.14s -> 7559.62s]  All right, cool.
[7560.18s -> 7562.29s]  Did you know?
[7562.29s -> 7562.93s]  No, I saved it.
[7562.93s -> 7563.97s]  I saved it like three times.
[7564.61s -> 7565.41s]  Just make sure it's...
[7566.37s -> 7567.41s]  Now this should work.
[7568.05s -> 7570.13s]  I did everything I should from the...
[7570.69s -> 7571.89s]  Post the fight to Twitter.
[7571.89s -> 7574.29s]  I will once the Pikachu socks come in.
[7575.76s -> 7576.56s]  Next week or something.
[7578.32s -> 7580.56s]  All right, let me just make sure it's read only.
[7580.56s -> 7587.26s]  It is FOB 90, disable screen border, render viewpoint.
[7594.27s -> 7595.95s]  So that's all activated now.
[7599.36s -> 7600.32s]  Should be all saved.
[7608.13s -> 7608.45s]  All right.
[7609.01s -> 7610.45s]  Now I'm actually going to go pee.
[7610.45s -> 7611.65s]  So I'll be right back.
[7782.46s -> 7782.78s]  All right.
[7784.22s -> 7785.10s]  Let's try this again.
[7797.50s -> 7798.06s]  Open that.
[7798.70s -> 7802.54s]  Okay.
[7802.54s -> 7804.30s]  All right, cross your fingers.
[7804.30s -> 7805.02s]  Let's hope this works.
[7805.66s -> 7807.39s]  It's going to be a little loud too.
[7807.39s -> 7808.19s]  I can't really change it
[7808.19s -> 7811.55s]  because there's no windowed full screen in this game.
[7812.27s -> 7814.91s]  So loud incoming, prepare your ears.
[7816.03s -> 7823.44s]  All right, come on.
[7824.66s -> 7825.54s]  Take off the FOB.
[7825.54s -> 7826.34s]  Take off the border.
[7836.08s -> 7836.48s]  Damn it.
[7841.22s -> 7841.54s]  Why?
[7842.18s -> 7856.66s]  Come on, this is just here, right?
[7856.66s -> 7860.19s]  It's just in the first menu.
[7860.19s -> 7861.15s]  I made it read only.
[7861.15s -> 7862.99s]  I added the three things to the bottom.
[7862.99s -> 7868.62s]  I saved it.
[7868.62s -> 7877.81s]  Come on, do it.
[7882.13s -> 7882.37s]  Yes.
[7885.42s -> 7887.10s]  Oh, I feel like I can breathe.
[7887.10s -> 7895.89s]  I'm dead.
[7895.89s -> 7896.21s]  All right.
[7896.21s -> 7900.46s]  I was wine in a can.
[7900.46s -> 7902.06s]  No, it's a pineapple juice.
[7902.62s -> 7910.53s]  Oh, it went the other way this time.
[7911.17s -> 7923.33s]  Didn't hit him.
[7923.33s -> 7924.05s]  Come on.
[7924.05s -> 7924.77s]  Do I have another gun?
[7925.89s -> 7926.77s]  Oh, I have a rifle.
[7935.63s -> 7936.43s]  Come on.
[7936.43s -> 7938.11s]  None of those hit anybody.
[7938.11s -> 7939.23s]  You got to be shitting me.
[7977.47s -> 7978.51s]  I'm not going to take it.
[7978.51s -> 7980.27s]  Why ever take anything besides these two guns?
[7980.91s -> 7982.69s]  You know what I'm saying?
[7982.69s -> 7983.41s]  Like these are the best.
[7983.41s -> 7984.85s]  This is the only two guns you should have.
[7989.54s -> 7989.94s]  Nugget?
[7994.56s -> 7995.84s]  On the wall?
[7995.84s -> 7996.56s]  No.
[7996.56s -> 7997.60s]  Oh, a hundred bucks.
[8004.06s -> 8005.34s]  Oh god, this is going to be another one.
[8014.30s -> 8014.86s]  Big bets.
[8020.99s -> 8021.79s]  Fine harden.
[8037.71s -> 8038.35s]  I didn't get the...
[8039.55s -> 8041.23s]  I'm annoyed that I didn't get the secret.
[8048.03s -> 8048.67s]  All right, let's see.
[8048.67s -> 8049.79s]  Let me get like a times five.
[8050.67s -> 8051.39s]  Stay out here.
[8051.39s -> 8052.99s]  Keep it watched like this.
[8052.99s -> 8053.71s]  No worries.
[8057.68s -> 8059.30s]  They didn't ask there.
[8060.18s -> 8060.90s]  Damn it.
[8060.90s -> 8061.38s]  They knew.
[8062.50s -> 8067.74s]  Most of them.
[8067.74s -> 8068.22s]  Anybody else?
[8068.22s -> 8069.18s]  I had to spill a lot of blood.
[8069.18s -> 8070.78s]  That was a colatin.
[8070.78s -> 8071.66s]  It wasn't in that can.
[8071.66s -> 8073.01s]  All right, what's in here?
[8073.01s -> 8075.57s]  He was carousing in town with his closest friend.
[8076.37s -> 8080.11s]  Arden's boys apparently didn't want me to reach the bull's head.
[8080.91s -> 8082.43s]  They keep trying to give me what's...
[8082.43s -> 8083.47s]  I don't want that stuff.
[8083.47s -> 8086.51s]  To inform their hefe of my unwelcomed presence.
[8086.51s -> 8087.39s]  I definitely want that.
[8088.51s -> 8095.52s]  All right.
[8095.52s -> 8096.32s]  That's my close range.
[8096.32s -> 8097.12s]  This is my long range.
[8097.76s -> 8107.57s]  Jerma, can you pretend this is 50 dollars?
[8107.57s -> 8108.13s]  Thanks, man.
[8108.77s -> 8110.98s]  Pretend this game is 50 dollars?
[8112.35s -> 8114.35s]  I think this game's like six bucks.
[8114.99s -> 8116.59s]  Why would I pretend it's more money?
[8117.31s -> 8117.71s]  Hello?
[8136.11s -> 8136.83s]  Where?
[8136.83s -> 8138.53s]  I don't think this was supposed to be up here.
[8144.77s -> 8145.65s]  Jerma, come on.
[8145.65s -> 8146.13s]  Wait, what?
[8150.43s -> 8150.99s]  Bits?
[8150.99s -> 8151.31s]  Was it...
[8151.31s -> 8151.79s]  Oh, bit...
[8151.79s -> 8152.11s]  Hold.
[8152.11s -> 8154.51s]  My streamlabs is not even updated.
[8154.51s -> 8154.91s]  Hold on.
[8155.47s -> 8160.74s]  Hold on a second.
[8161.30s -> 8168.70s]  Oh, gee.
[8168.70s -> 8170.22s]  Amscoots gave 50 bucks.
[8170.86s -> 8175.55s]  No, that was yesterday.
[8176.51s -> 8177.95s]  Okay, hold on.
[8177.95s -> 8179.31s]  All right, all right, all right, all right.
[8180.18s -> 8180.74s]  I get it.
[8180.74s -> 8181.94s]  I understand now.
[8181.94s -> 8185.07s]  Do you get...
[8185.79s -> 8188.42s]  I get it.
[8188.42s -> 8188.74s]  There's the...
[8188.74s -> 8189.78s]  Not the game.
[8189.78s -> 8190.66s]  The bits.
[8190.66s -> 8191.54s]  Pretend the bits...
[8191.54s -> 8193.30s]  Can you pretend this is 50 bucks?
[8193.86s -> 8194.90s]  I was saying...
[8194.90s -> 8195.22s]  Thank you.
[8195.22s -> 8197.06s]  Wait, what the fuck are you talking about?
[8211.98s -> 8214.06s]  That's double digit IQ.
[8214.06s -> 8215.58s]  No, it's called...
[8215.58s -> 8217.18s]  I'm paying attention to the game.
[8218.35s -> 8220.03s]  And I look over and I see...
[8220.03s -> 8221.47s]  Pretend this is 50 bucks.
[8223.63s -> 8225.39s]  I got a triple digit IQ.
[8225.39s -> 8226.43s]  I already told you what it was.
[8228.82s -> 8232.10s]  126 with a few deductions.
[8232.74s -> 8249.26s]  It was 126 and I got the 18 points deducted
[8249.26s -> 8250.78s]  because I ripped the page in half
[8251.42s -> 8256.45s]  and said, you can't.
[8256.45s -> 8257.33s]  I'm not doing it.
[8258.75s -> 8260.11s]  And then it was minus 10 points
[8260.75s -> 8262.70s]  because I fell asleep during the test.
[8263.34s -> 8265.94s]  And I steeled myself for the fight ahead
[8265.94s -> 8267.46s]  for as good as I was.
[8268.10s -> 8270.26s]  Deep down I wondered if John Wesley
[8270.26s -> 8274.05s]  wasn't just a little bit better.
[8274.05s -> 8275.41s]  And then I got plus 8 points
[8276.13s -> 8278.77s]  because I got one question right
[8278.77s -> 8280.21s]  that nobody else did.
[8280.21s -> 8281.25s]  So they were like, Jesus,
[8281.25s -> 8282.45s]  we've got to get some extra points here.
[8286.03s -> 8286.99s]  It was...
[8286.99s -> 8288.67s]  What was Abraham Lincoln's wife's name?
[8290.14s -> 8290.78s]  I don't know why.
[8290.78s -> 8292.06s]  I'm the only person, I guess,
[8292.06s -> 8293.50s]  in the country that knew what that was.
[8322.16s -> 8325.92s]  Minus 10 points for trying to stream the test.
[8326.48s -> 8327.60s]  Why are none of these hitting?
[8332.37s -> 8332.85s]  Okay.
[8332.85s -> 8334.05s]  I was in Q mode.
[8334.05s -> 8335.41s]  That's absolute bullshit.
[8336.13s -> 8338.27s]  It's not bad aim.
[8338.83s -> 8340.30s]  It's not bad aim.
[8340.30s -> 8341.02s]  Game is not even...
[8341.02s -> 8342.94s]  It's like fucking a bug in the game.
[8342.94s -> 8344.70s]  It's like a game bug problem, you know?
[8346.69s -> 8347.97s]  It's not my problem.
[8347.97s -> 8350.21s]  It's a game code bug fucking issue.
[8351.17s -> 8360.64s]  Like, what's with that code?
[8361.46s -> 8362.18s]  Watch this code.
[8362.90s -> 8363.46s]  Unbelievable.
[8364.02s -> 8370.67s]  Like, bracket stop.
[8370.67s -> 8371.95s]  Bracket close.
[8373.15s -> 8374.43s]  C, line one.
[8374.43s -> 8375.39s]  Like, fuck you.
[8375.39s -> 8376.27s]  You know what I mean?
[8376.27s -> 8376.75s]  Watch this.
[8377.47s -> 8379.02s]  What was that?
[8379.74s -> 8396.56s]  Oh, yeah.
[8396.56s -> 8397.44s]  Bracket if.
[8397.44s -> 8397.84s]  Stop.
[8397.84s -> 8398.80s]  Bracket close.
[8398.80s -> 8399.28s]  Hyphen.
[8400.16s -> 8400.88s]  Semicolon.
[8402.43s -> 8404.19s]  Then, entity A.
[8404.19s -> 8404.99s]  Bracket close.
[8404.99s -> 8405.31s]  Stop.
[8407.62s -> 8408.26s]  New bracket.
[8411.87s -> 8413.47s]  Thank God that was a code that worked.
[8416.67s -> 8417.15s]  Okay.
[8417.15s -> 8419.07s]  I've got to stop fucking around.
[8419.07s -> 8433.95s]  Does German know that IQ tests aren't written tests?
[8437.46s -> 8438.82s]  There's some written portions.
[8439.54s -> 8441.46s]  You've got to remember numbers sequences.
[8441.46s -> 8441.94s]  You have to...
[8442.90s -> 8448.10s]  Uh, you have to like move blocks around and create pictures with blocks.
[8448.98s -> 8449.70s]  I did one.
[8449.70s -> 8450.82s]  They take like six hours.
[8451.30s -> 8452.10s]  I've done it twice.
[8454.13s -> 8458.29s]  Guys, an IQ test is not as simple as going to like iqtest.com and it takes 30 minutes.
[8458.29s -> 8458.77s]  No, no, no.
[8458.77s -> 8461.15s]  It takes like fucking all day.
[8461.15s -> 8461.87s]  My God.
[8462.59s -> 8464.67s]  Like, just enlightened on another level I am.
[8467.60s -> 8467.92s]  See?
[8468.72s -> 8479.60s]  Let's see.
[8479.60s -> 8483.23s]  What have we got?
[8483.23s -> 8485.47s]  You did it twice so you can add the numbers together.
[8485.47s -> 8487.94s]  That's not how it works.
[8489.20s -> 8490.08s]  Uh, let's see.
[8490.88s -> 8492.80s]  Fast revolver reload.
[8493.44s -> 8497.81s]  Let's, let me look at the other one.
[8499.84s -> 8500.72s]  Fast aiming.
[8501.52s -> 8503.70s]  Throw, shoot the dynamite.
[8503.70s -> 8506.02s]  Create a nice fireworks display and do some damage as well.
[8506.66s -> 8510.02s]  After you throw a stick of dynamite, you can easily shoot it from the hip
[8510.02s -> 8512.10s]  as the crosshair of your gun will get sticky to it.
[8512.90s -> 8514.18s]  Huh, that's cool.
[8515.84s -> 8518.08s]  Dual-weld IQ tests.
[8518.08s -> 8519.76s]  Just hold them up in the air.
[8520.48s -> 8522.16s]  Look at how much smarter I am than you.
[8528.21s -> 8531.70s]  What's this one?
[8531.70s -> 8532.34s]  Headhunter.
[8532.34s -> 8533.94s]  More concentration for headshots.
[8538.08s -> 8539.84s]  Make some headshots to increase your focus.
[8541.58s -> 8542.70s]  Oh yeah, I want that.
[8543.58s -> 8544.38s]  I want this next.
[8545.02s -> 8560.74s]  You say you have high IQ, but you're a streamer.
[8564.61s -> 8569.15s]  What does, I, I don't know.
[8569.15s -> 8569.87s]  Okay.
[8569.87s -> 8573.71s]  Is it, is it like a sample size of streamers that are just like dopes or something?
[8573.71s -> 8574.91s]  I don't understand what that means.
[8575.55s -> 8582.05s]  How many channels alive right now?
[8582.69s -> 8591.14s]  Hey, it's real easy to take like the high ground.
[8592.26s -> 8592.98s]  I'm so smart.
[8592.98s -> 8593.62s]  I'm so smart.
[8593.62s -> 8595.73s]  I'm smarter than the streamer.
[8595.73s -> 8596.29s]  Are you though?
[8597.95s -> 8599.55s]  Are you telling?
[8600.19s -> 8602.11s]  How do you calculate that?
[8602.11s -> 8602.83s]  How do you know that?
[8612.34s -> 8616.10s]  Well, I know this because you didn't get a headshot on that guy behind you
[8616.66s -> 8617.54s]  and you died there.
[8617.54s -> 8620.02s]  That's why I know I'm just, I'm so much smarter than you.
[8649.71s -> 8650.11s]  What?
[8650.11s -> 8651.07s]  I don't know what's erection.
[8651.87s -> 8653.79s]  I couldn't see through the chain link fence.
[8655.87s -> 8662.43s]  Didn't you know that reaction times and hand-eye coordination is intelligence?
[8662.43s -> 8667.65s]  What are you talking about?
[8667.65s -> 8697.65s]  Dude, I, dude, it's like throwing fucking ketchup in my eyes.
[8702.99s -> 8704.03s]  I can't even see that.
[8704.03s -> 8706.03s]  Like squeezing blood in my face.
[8707.14s -> 8707.86s]  God damn.
[8724.67s -> 8725.71s]  I can't see shit.
[8729.70s -> 8732.98s]  If you get shot, all of a sudden the whole world goes blank
[8732.98s -> 8735.14s]  and there's 10 people in a circle around you.
[8744.00s -> 8744.64s]  What?
[8744.64s -> 8774.34s]  This shit, that shit's just not going to happen.
[8774.34s -> 8779.14s]  Like everything is made out of these fucking whole fences.
[8793.55s -> 8797.47s]  If you're so smart, what's a hundred times two?
[8802.19s -> 8803.63s]  I have no idea.
[8803.63s -> 8808.98s]  It's one times two, then you carry the two zeros.
[8808.98s -> 8809.38s]  I don't know.
[8812.88s -> 8814.48s]  Math does not equal intelligence.
[8815.28s -> 8818.70s]  How good you are with numbers and math is not intelligence.
[8818.70s -> 8821.02s]  It's being able to add things and subtract things together
[8821.02s -> 8821.82s]  and times them and shit.
[8829.55s -> 8833.07s]  I'd need my own if I was ever to defeat him.
[8833.07s -> 8834.03s]  Was he just stand there?
[8838.14s -> 8839.02s]  This is freaking me out.
[8839.02s -> 8840.22s]  Why is he just sitting there like this?
[8842.35s -> 8844.51s]  Am I fighting a cardboard cutout or is the guy behind me?
[8845.15s -> 8850.53s]  I'm sure of it.
[8864.85s -> 8867.73s]  Oh God, this is like a fucking wet sock.
[8872.70s -> 8879.74s]  Why would you put that in item?
[8906.42s -> 8908.02s]  No shit, I didn't want to do that.
[8908.74s -> 8918.66s]  I clicked it accidentally.
[8918.66s -> 8921.06s]  I actually clicked it accidentally.
[8921.14s -> 8953.10s]  I feel like I'm tied up right now.
[8953.10s -> 8953.34s]  What?
[8953.34s -> 8954.22s]  I tried dodge.
[8954.22s -> 8954.62s]  I'm done.
[8972.99s -> 8980.53s]  This is the one.
[8999.10s -> 9000.70s]  Did I get him?
[9004.62s -> 9005.34s]  It's scripted.
[9005.34s -> 9005.90s]  I can't kill.
[9006.62s -> 9012.46s]  Some restless Avenger took his life, shot him in the back, just like this one.
[9012.46s -> 9013.90s]  Anybody up for another beer?
[9016.62s -> 9024.37s]  That was supposed to have no skills.
[9031.82s -> 9032.46s]  Intelligence.
[9033.60s -> 9034.80s]  I get news for you.
[9034.80s -> 9036.16s]  Everyone's fucking dumb.
[9036.16s -> 9039.84s]  Some say revenge is a dish best served cold.
[9041.71s -> 9043.47s]  So whatever happened to that Bob guy?
[9043.47s -> 9048.51s]  Personally, I'd like to hear some of your other adventures.
[9048.51s -> 9051.20s]  Like, I don't know.
[9051.20s -> 9053.76s]  Do you ever go toe-to-toe with a red man?
[9053.76s -> 9058.02s]  There's only been like eight smart people to ever live.
[9061.52s -> 9062.88s]  They call it the enlightened eight.
[9063.68s -> 9068.62s]  I remember once I was after this renegade batchie.
[9068.62s -> 9072.86s]  Strangely enough, revenge was also his primary motivation.
[9082.26s -> 9082.90s]  Who are they?
[9101.07s -> 9103.71s]  I said, look, look, I'm reading the story.
[9103.71s -> 9104.43s]  Ben Franklin.
[9108.24s -> 9108.96s]  Ben Franklin.
[9110.29s -> 9112.37s]  Um, Stephen Hawking.
[9114.30s -> 9119.58s]  Gray Wolf was a Chiricahua Apache medicine man who had led a war party in revenge for
[9119.58s -> 9121.10s]  a massacre against his people.
[9121.10s -> 9121.90s]  Albert Einstein.
[9121.90s -> 9125.90s]  The U.S. Army had attacked his tribe during his daughter's sacred sunrise.
[9126.54s -> 9127.66s]  The Heinz ketchup lady.
[9127.66s -> 9129.50s]  The slaughter was unspeakable.
[9129.50s -> 9134.46s]  I understood his anger, as there's nothing more traumatic than seeing those...
[9134.46s -> 9136.06s]  Who's the guy that invented the washing machine?
[9136.06s -> 9137.58s]  ...cruel and painful death.
[9146.77s -> 9148.37s]  No, not Mr...
[9148.37s -> 9150.21s]  Not John Maytag.
[9153.76s -> 9154.64s]  All right, so you got...
[9163.68s -> 9164.72s]  That's, that's four.
[9164.72s -> 9165.76s]  That's enough.
[9165.76s -> 9169.10s]  I don't know.
[9169.10s -> 9170.22s]  Uh, Dr. Dre.
[9171.18s -> 9184.90s]  Uh, um, Dr. Ocher.
[9185.76s -> 9186.96s]  Two doctors on that list.
[9192.21s -> 9193.17s]  Dr. Pepper.
[9195.28s -> 9196.56s]  They all gotta be doctors.
[9197.20s -> 9201.04s]  Oh, fuck, I'm going the wrong way.
[9212.35s -> 9213.23s]  Dr. Doom.
[9213.23s -> 9215.47s]  Yeah, there's gotta be a fictional doctor on that list.
[9215.47s -> 9215.95s]  That's true.
[9216.51s -> 9226.83s]  Dr. Octopus Doll.
[9226.83s -> 9227.63s]  Dr. House.
[9228.27s -> 9230.08s]  All right, that's like 11.
[9230.08s -> 9230.96s]  That's enough, I think.
[9235.15s -> 9237.07s]  Are you implying that Dr. Pepper isn't real?
[9237.07s -> 9239.39s]  Dr. Pepper is 78 ingredients.
[9239.39s -> 9240.43s]  78 different people.
[9243.25s -> 9246.85s]  Guys, Dr. Pepper is like Satoshi Nakamoto.
[9247.81s -> 9251.17s]  It's like 30 people that made one product, one beverage.
[9251.17s -> 9252.78s]  It's like Shakespeare.
[9252.78s -> 9256.62s]  He led a band of young Apache warriors who wanted retribution.
[9256.62s -> 9271.30s]  That's a myth.
[9272.32s -> 9273.52s]  Well, you, we don't...
[9273.52s -> 9274.08s]  I don't know.
[9274.08s -> 9274.96s]  You don't know.
[9277.25s -> 9278.13s]  Oh, do you know?
[9278.85s -> 9279.92s]  You don't know?
[9280.56s -> 9293.02s]  Stop, stop.
[9293.02s -> 9294.54s]  I just, I'm just playing.
[9296.38s -> 9296.86s]  Stop it.
[9298.14s -> 9298.86s]  Who?
[9298.86s -> 9312.91s]  Did you say the turkeys were endangered?
[9322.26s -> 9324.08s]  What was that guy doing?
[9324.80s -> 9332.02s]  What?
[9332.02s -> 9339.78s]  Ooh, hey, what line of sight do you have?
[9340.94s -> 9341.66s]  Oh, I see.
[9342.62s -> 9343.42s]  The bullshit one.
[9344.06s -> 9350.46s]  Oh, he was busy.
[9350.46s -> 9351.66s]  He was inventing the what?
[9352.38s -> 9357.79s]  All right, I'm not gonna be one of those people
[9357.79s -> 9359.15s]  that just gets like really mad at like,
[9359.15s -> 9361.07s]  the fact that I didn't get any hit registration there.
[9375.81s -> 9376.31s]  Where?
[9387.65s -> 9390.88s]  Ah, all right.
[9390.88s -> 9392.32s]  Ah, I don't have to say anything.
[9392.32s -> 9393.28s]  I'll have to go is...
[9393.28s -> 9401.54s]  Ah, I already have that.
[9404.72s -> 9406.61s]  Where's it going?
[9407.25s -> 9418.75s]  Where is he?
[9418.75s -> 9434.37s]  Who's left?
[9434.37s -> 9434.85s]  Is that it?
[9435.41s -> 9439.26s]  I think that's it.
[9439.98s -> 9441.79s]  Any more game refueled?
[9448.00s -> 9448.72s]  All right.
[9448.72s -> 9453.95s]  It didn't work.
[9453.95s -> 9454.59s]  It didn't work.
[9454.59s -> 9455.15s]  It didn't work.
[9455.87s -> 9456.67s]  It's supposed to work.
[9458.82s -> 9459.46s]  Come on.
[9459.46s -> 9459.94s]  What?
[9459.94s -> 9460.44s]  No.
[9461.24s -> 9463.78s]  Will you tell me that drinking powdered sugar
[9463.78s -> 9466.90s]  and powdered vitamins like B2 and B12
[9466.90s -> 9468.58s]  is not going to give me superpowers?
[9469.22s -> 9471.54s]  With like orange creamsicle flavoring?
[9472.10s -> 9472.74s]  What?
[9472.74s -> 9473.24s]  No.
[9481.60s -> 9482.32s]  Okay, hold on.
[9482.88s -> 9494.29s]  Hold on.
[9494.29s -> 9496.85s]  You guys mean to tell me that glorified Kool-Aid
[9496.85s -> 9498.45s]  is not going to make me a better gamer?
[9499.56s -> 9500.06s]  What?
[9500.68s -> 9519.35s]  You need those acai berries.
[9519.67s -> 9526.28s]  A deep crevice that led to a...
[9526.28s -> 9527.32s]  Holy shit, that scared me.
[9527.32s -> 9535.06s]  Yeah, but it's not very so much cousin.
[9535.06s -> 9536.50s]  How do you feel about brain fluid?
[9537.14s -> 9539.92s]  I mean, it hurts if you drink it, but
[9540.56s -> 9543.20s]  I think that's because it's too acidic.
[9543.92s -> 9572.80s]  Why does he know that?
[9572.80s -> 9574.32s]  Okay, that scared the shit...
[9574.32s -> 9576.56s]  I thought the rock was fucking alive.
[9583.89s -> 9584.45s]  It was weird.
[9584.45s -> 9586.21s]  It was like glitching out and fucking coming at me.
[9598.36s -> 9599.80s]  Search the caves.
[9599.80s -> 9602.80s]  We got ourselves a search mission.
[9603.36s -> 9609.60s]  All right.
[9609.60s -> 9611.12s]  I want to get times like five here.
[9611.12s -> 9611.36s]  Ready?
[9611.36s -> 9612.24s]  One, two, three.
[9613.04s -> 9617.75s]  There it is.
[9618.29s -> 9619.35s]  Times four.
[9619.91s -> 9624.58s]  It didn't happen this time.
[9626.72s -> 9630.00s]  High IQ streamer scared by beehive.
[9630.00s -> 9631.36s]  That's what I thought that was for a second.
[9633.86s -> 9634.36s]  Really?
[9659.16s -> 9660.28s]  I thought they were going to come forward.
[9676.98s -> 9677.48s]  Damn.
[9681.94s -> 9682.98s]  I hope they get you.
[9683.70s -> 9688.12s]  Come on.
[9688.12s -> 9688.62s]  Really?
[9689.08s -> 9690.56s]  Be nicer to me.
[9691.20s -> 9698.32s]  Oh, secret.
[9701.57s -> 9702.45s]  No level up though.
[9703.09s -> 9704.48s]  That's pissing me off.
[9706.71s -> 9707.75s]  No level up.
[9707.75s -> 9709.51s]  It's like really fucking pissing me off now.
[9719.68s -> 9720.56s]  That wasn't a headshot.
[9720.56s -> 9722.64s]  It's like, you know, it's like fucking pissing me off now.
[9729.38s -> 9730.26s]  Played red steel too.
[9730.26s -> 9732.02s]  I know you have a Wii, you casual fuck.
[9732.02s -> 9732.98s]  That's like pissing me off.
[9734.42s -> 9735.06s]  Relax, man.
[9735.06s -> 9736.26s]  Like that's fucking pissing me off.
[9736.90s -> 9751.65s]  Just code happiness into the game.
[9752.88s -> 9754.00s]  Happiness is pissing me off.
[9754.00s -> 9755.28s]  Don't fucking be happy right now.
[9755.28s -> 9755.76s]  I don't want you.
[9755.76s -> 9756.48s]  I don't want you.
[9756.48s -> 9757.28s]  That's makes...
[9757.28s -> 9757.68s]  I don't know.
[9757.68s -> 9758.16s]  Whatever.
[9758.16s -> 9758.66s]  Let's just go.
[9758.66s -> 9760.74s]  He was haunted with dead Indian ghosts.
[9762.02s -> 9763.22s]  You're pissing me off.
[9766.41s -> 9769.69s]  Or concerned with the live ones than the dead ones.
[9772.62s -> 9773.42s]  Smiler?
[9778.39s -> 9778.89s]  What?
[9779.27s -> 9784.38s]  No, I got such a good hit rating going right now.
[9784.38s -> 9786.38s]  Don't fuck it up because you pressed the wrong button.
[9787.18s -> 9794.97s]  Keep the streak.
[9795.53s -> 9797.70s]  It's all about the streak right now.
[9797.70s -> 9798.20s]  Come on.
[9800.30s -> 9800.80s]  Five.
[9802.98s -> 9803.48s]  Six.
[9805.78s -> 9806.58s]  Oh, that's all that's here.
[9806.58s -> 9807.70s]  They were sisters.
[9807.70s -> 9810.84s]  Religion is traditional among the Mescalero.
[9810.84s -> 9811.64s]  So what happened?
[9811.64s -> 9813.11s]  I had to get out of there.
[9813.88s -> 9815.80s]  Those girls never shut up.
[9815.80s -> 9817.88s]  Both of them nagging at me all the time.
[9817.88s -> 9819.78s]  Drove me half crazy.
[9819.78s -> 9821.22s]  Haven't seen them since.
[9821.22s -> 9823.46s]  No, I mean what happened with Grey Wolf?
[9823.46s -> 9823.96s]  Oh.
[9825.54s -> 9837.58s]  I pursued him into a cave of death.
[9837.58s -> 9840.15s]  Secret.
[9840.15s -> 9840.95s]  Now I gotta level up.
[9840.95s -> 9841.45s]  Okay.
[9847.59s -> 9849.11s]  Streamer, you're grinding my gears.
[9851.67s -> 9852.17s]  It's okay.
[9855.77s -> 9856.81s]  I wanted to headhunter, right?
[9856.81s -> 9857.31s]  Yeah.
[9859.67s -> 9860.39s]  None can hide.
[9860.39s -> 9864.47s]  Hints about enemies behind you spot enemies even beyond your field of view
[9864.47s -> 9865.51s]  during concentration.
[9865.99s -> 9868.87s]  Marcus on the edge of the screen will point at every enemy nearby.
[9869.67s -> 9871.43s]  Every nearby enemy that you would not normally see.
[9872.15s -> 9874.20s]  And then we get the golden rifle.
[9874.20s -> 9874.60s]  I want that.
[9874.60s -> 9875.48s]  We're gonna go fast.
[9876.66s -> 9878.50s]  Full fast tech tree and golden rifle.
[9879.06s -> 9887.06s]  Can you get a talent to make it so that you can actually aim?
[9887.70s -> 9893.96s]  I mean, is that like supposed to be funny?
[9894.60s -> 9896.26s]  Was that supposed to be a funny joke?
[9907.90s -> 9909.02s]  I didn't think it was very funny.
[9909.02s -> 9911.18s]  Carry great darkness in your heart.
[9911.18s -> 9914.14s]  If you do not release it, it will claim your soul.
[9914.94s -> 9923.32s]  The sound of his voice put some kind of ancient Indian spell on me.
[9923.32s -> 9923.88s]  What's going on?
[9924.52s -> 9927.22s]  Has his story unfolded in my mind?
[9927.94s -> 9932.44s]  You will come to this place again and kill many more men.
[9932.44s -> 9935.56s]  And the darkness will grow until it consumes everything.
[9935.56s -> 9938.36s]  No, this is a good way to get to like plus 10 or 20.
[9939.40s -> 9945.85s]  He said I was a great warrior.
[9946.49s -> 9950.90s]  A pile of unequal will face warriors.
[9950.90s -> 9952.26s]  Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!
[9952.26s -> 9954.02s]  My combo, my combo, my combo!
[9954.02s -> 9967.08s]  Snakes will bite shadows.
[9967.08s -> 9968.12s]  Definitely snakes.
[9970.15s -> 9974.63s]  And indeed, his warrior surrounded me and attacked me like hungry wolves.
[9974.63s -> 9977.51s]  Well, that was, that was not cool.
[9979.75s -> 9993.51s]  All right, you just, you broke my concentration.
[9994.23s -> 9995.93s]  Anybody else?
[10001.78s -> 10002.18s]  Is that it?
[10005.64s -> 10007.00s]  Did I shoot him in the eyelash?
[10007.00s -> 10011.11s]  Anyway, out of this trap, but suddenly one just appeared.
[10011.83s -> 10013.06s]  Come here.
[10013.06s -> 10019.06s]  Well, I got to level up.
[10020.46s -> 10020.94s]  Right here.
[10023.26s -> 10024.06s]  Yeah, this is good.
[10024.06s -> 10025.34s]  Okay, then we get executioner.
[10028.36s -> 10030.60s]  So I can spot enemies even beyond my field of view.
[10033.67s -> 10035.27s]  It'll just show me where people are.
[10036.38s -> 10037.18s]  Oh, wow.
[10037.18s -> 10038.38s]  Cheating game is now easy.
[10038.94s -> 10042.84s]  There's nobody here.
[10045.02s -> 10046.46s]  Oh, no, nevermind.
[10046.46s -> 10057.00s]  I'll take the ammo, though.
[10059.16s -> 10060.20s]  Dermot, are you joking?
[10061.80s -> 10065.00s]  I mean, I saw the like, okay, I look, I just pressed the level up button and
[10065.00s -> 10067.88s]  all of a sudden I saw like two or three stars pop up.
[10080.92s -> 10081.88s]  He never jokes.
[10082.78s -> 10084.94s]  Very serious streamer.
[10087.34s -> 10088.62s]  I hit, I pressed the button.
[10089.34s -> 10091.42s]  What was wrong with that?
[10104.49s -> 10108.20s]  Oh, chase.
[10123.35s -> 10124.63s]  He can't reach it.
[10124.63s -> 10125.67s]  He can't reach it.
[10130.12s -> 10134.26s]  I hit every single one of those shots.
[10150.20s -> 10150.76s]  What?
[10150.76s -> 10155.67s]  Wait, where the hell were you?
[10158.97s -> 10159.53s]  What?
[10159.53s -> 10162.49s]  It's really pissing me off.
[10162.49s -> 10163.37s]  It's pissing me off.
[10164.01s -> 10169.74s]  Is that the one thing I'm going to repeat 100 times today?
[10169.74s -> 10170.22s]  Probably.
[10183.27s -> 10184.55s]  Where the fuck are you?
[10186.76s -> 10188.12s]  Where's this magic person?
[10208.47s -> 10210.87s]  Boss fight.
[10212.87s -> 10216.23s]  I, okay, I just put my head, I scratched my fucking face.
[10219.94s -> 10221.54s]  This is sometimes why I want the face cam.
[10222.26s -> 10224.44s]  So you guys can see like my proof.
[10240.10s -> 10241.38s]  I don't know, I don't know where he is.
[10241.38s -> 10242.82s]  I don't know where I, I don't.
[10244.02s -> 10271.69s]  Where are you?
[10272.82s -> 10273.94s]  What the fuck is you?
[10279.03s -> 10279.75s]  Jesus.
[10279.75s -> 10280.07s]  Okay.
[10326.76s -> 10327.24s]  Come on.
[10339.30s -> 10340.66s]  I'm getting deja vu.
[10341.30s -> 10344.39s]  Is he getting deja vu?
[10348.71s -> 10350.71s]  You have to, yeah, don't you have to like break the cycle?
[10352.44s -> 10354.60s]  So go, like go pee or something.
[10359.35s -> 10361.03s]  Go pee, pee and like shake your face a little bit
[10361.03s -> 10362.07s]  and then put some water in your face
[10362.07s -> 10363.59s]  and you'll like wake up in the real world.
[10369.13s -> 10371.86s]  Was I supposed to do something there?
[10372.50s -> 10380.63s]  Was I supposed to, I don't think I was supposed to do something.
[10381.43s -> 10387.29s]  No, throw some water in your face.
[10411.40s -> 10413.48s]  Do exactly what you do in the deja vu.
[10413.48s -> 10414.76s]  You can predict the future.
[10419.08s -> 10423.66s]  Have you ever played a first person shooter before?
[10427.98s -> 10429.74s]  I'm doing just fine, 63%.
[10429.74s -> 10430.86s]  You sound like all those headshots.
[10430.86s -> 10431.58s]  What are you talking about?
[10441.67s -> 10443.75s]  Why do you guys act like I'm from the 1800s?
[10443.75s -> 10445.11s]  This is the first time I've ever seen a movie.
[10461.88s -> 10462.92s]  You should play bullet storm.
[10464.34s -> 10465.54s]  Yeah, bullet storm looks really fun.
[10465.54s -> 10467.62s]  I played it for a little while, not very long.
[10477.14s -> 10483.46s]  Two banks at the same time?
[10484.98s -> 10489.14s]  Bullet storm is a great, it'll be a great stream.
[10490.76s -> 10494.52s]  Yeah, I like these cool stylish shooters.
[10499.43s -> 10500.87s]  What is this I see in front of me?
[10502.82s -> 10503.32s]  Magic?
[10504.74s -> 10506.90s]  I don't think it, I'm very comfortable here
[10506.90s -> 10509.30s]  seeing as the magic that's playing out in front of me.
[10509.30s -> 10510.34s]  I've never been here before.
[10510.34s -> 10511.86s]  I've never seen such a thing before.
[10511.86s -> 10512.90s]  Witchcraft, I say.
[10519.10s -> 10524.26s]  A moving picture that one can control.
[10525.50s -> 10526.38s]  No, no, no, no.
[10526.38s -> 10527.50s]  I've never heard of such a thing.
[10530.18s -> 10530.66s]  Burn it.
[10531.14s -> 10539.64s]  The brothers paid dearly for their stupidity,
[10540.20s -> 10543.85s]  but everybody knows they had it coming.
[10543.85s -> 10545.61s]  There's more to it than that.
[10545.61s -> 10548.34s]  I read all about it, so I know for a fact
[10548.34s -> 10550.18s]  that it went down very differently.
[10552.47s -> 10554.71s]  First of all, it was high noon.
[10554.71s -> 10557.91s]  A posse of U.S. deputy marshals were on the rooftop.
[10557.91s -> 10559.67s]  U.S. deputy marshals.
[10559.67s -> 10560.17s]  True thing.
[10562.07s -> 10563.26s]  Get into it.
[10564.04s -> 10566.28s]  Level up the hole in the daltons for the months.
[10566.28s -> 10568.68s]  Now they finally had them dead to rights.
[10568.76s -> 10574.86s]  Among them was a bounty hunter feared by marshals
[10574.86s -> 10576.30s]  trying to get the daltons to surrender.
[10580.71s -> 10583.27s]  This battle for the brothers was far too crowded.
[10583.27s -> 10587.48s]  Come on, somebody else come out.
[10588.28s -> 10588.78s]  Please.
[10590.25s -> 10591.77s]  No, sorry.
[10599.05s -> 10599.61s]  Back of the bank.
[10599.61s -> 10612.25s]  He saw a way to get an expect from behind.
[10612.81s -> 10614.09s]  In the back, behind the bank.
[10616.94s -> 10617.98s]  But they might be a secret.
[10625.86s -> 10626.50s]  No, no, no, no.
[10626.50s -> 10626.82s]  Really?
[10626.82s -> 10627.94s]  Come on, there's no secret here.
[10628.50s -> 10632.38s]  Oh well.
[10639.80s -> 10642.60s]  A steep ladder, laughing at danger as he did.
[10649.98s -> 10653.10s]  Bulletstorm is the most generic shooter ever created.
[10653.10s -> 10653.60s]  Jesus.
[10655.18s -> 10670.72s]  I made it.
[10681.76s -> 10682.24s]  More and more.
[10682.24s -> 10683.84s]  You know, a speedrun of this game would be really cool.
[10684.56s -> 10690.12s]  Just sprinting through and just racking up like times 20 or something.
[10690.76s -> 10694.20s]  Oh, I feel like I don't want any of these.
[10695.18s -> 10695.68s]  I don't.
[10696.22s -> 10703.60s]  I don't think I want any more.
[10710.04s -> 10710.68s]  Oh, he...
[10710.68s -> 10711.18s]  What?
[10727.04s -> 10729.20s]  That's not how you load those pistols.
[10729.20s -> 10729.70s]  Nugget?
[10731.23s -> 10732.11s]  In the...
[10732.11s -> 10737.02s]  I have level up, I'll do it afterwards.
[10737.58s -> 10744.47s]  Okay.
[10760.38s -> 10761.02s]  Any more?
[10761.02s -> 10761.52s]  That's it.
[10774.40s -> 10775.84s]  Keep telling the same story.
[10782.02s -> 10782.66s]  This game...
[10782.66s -> 10783.22s]  This is...
[10783.22s -> 10784.66s]  This game is so dumb, I love it.
[10788.45s -> 10789.65s]  No, that's not how it happened.
[10790.77s -> 10792.13s]  Let me tell you what did happen.
[10798.93s -> 10799.43s]  Go back.
[10799.81s -> 10803.76s]  It was Halloween.
[10804.48s -> 10807.62s]  And I was doing the fucked up shit that I usually do.
[10809.23s -> 10810.59s]  Smashing pumpkins.
[10810.59s -> 10811.09s]  What?
[10820.06s -> 10821.98s]  The leader, the lover, the loser.
[10821.98s -> 10823.42s]  Bob, Emmett, and Gratt.
[10828.29s -> 10829.81s]  I wasn't even out of the cutscene, I took a hit.
[10832.62s -> 10833.34s]  The shielder.
[10839.39s -> 10848.91s]  Well, his name was shielder.
[10848.91s -> 10849.95s]  He was the shielder.
[10851.28s -> 10851.78s]  What?
[10852.24s -> 10853.36s]  I thought he had a health bar.
[10867.34s -> 10868.62s]  Now I know what the hell is going on.
[10868.62s -> 10879.73s]  Don't let him get away.
[10879.73s -> 10894.80s]  Just run around and just backstab him.
[10894.80s -> 10911.90s]  Come on, come on, come on.
[10911.90s -> 10912.40s]  What?
[10925.38s -> 10926.10s]  Where are you?
[10929.02s -> 10929.74s]  Where are you?
[10932.64s -> 10933.14s]  Oh.
[10934.08s -> 10944.45s]  Dispatch the Dalton Brothers allies in here.
[10959.20s -> 10960.00s]  Secret up here, probably.
[10962.29s -> 10963.41s]  Oh, you better believe it.
[10963.41s -> 10964.21s]  It's in here, right?
[10964.21s -> 10964.71s]  Come on.
[10967.06s -> 10967.94s]  Where is it?
[10967.94s -> 10969.06s]  I keep touching it.
[10969.06s -> 10969.56s]  Secret?
[10970.18s -> 10972.24s]  God damn it, where is it?
[10973.97s -> 10975.33s]  Ah, in here?
[10976.29s -> 10984.75s]  Where the fuck is this thing?
[10984.75s -> 10991.01s]  It's downstairs?
[10991.73s -> 11004.02s]  Oh, it's right here.
[11004.66s -> 11005.91s]  Got it.
[11010.45s -> 11011.09s]  My god!
[11012.56s -> 11013.44s]  What the fuck?
[11014.16s -> 11019.57s]  Where is this guy?
[11020.13s -> 11026.38s]  My goodness.
[11027.10s -> 11027.60s]  Up here.
[11038.67s -> 11039.31s]  Is that gonna hit me?
[11041.95s -> 11044.35s]  Um, I can go underneath?
[11045.31s -> 11047.63s]  Wait, why did this turn into Donkey Kong?
[11048.67s -> 11052.72s]  I did it.
[11052.72s -> 11064.22s]  You can get up there.
[11064.22s -> 11064.78s]  I know you can.
[11073.63s -> 11074.51s]  Emmett Dalton.
[11075.39s -> 11085.47s]  Oh, why is he just walking over to me like the Terminator?
[11087.79s -> 11088.29s]  He just...
[11093.73s -> 11095.09s]  Why is he right here?
[11095.89s -> 11105.28s]  I thought maybe I could...
[11105.28s -> 11107.28s]  It gave me a cover system.
[11107.28s -> 11116.13s]  Is there another place I can run to?
[11116.77s -> 11117.82s]  Right over there.
[11119.82s -> 11120.32s]  Okay.
[11120.88s -> 11125.48s]  Itchy leg.
[11126.04s -> 11153.35s]  Ah, ow.
[11153.35s -> 11173.78s]  Go back this way.
[11173.78s -> 11174.66s]  Ow!
[11174.66s -> 11182.71s]  I just stopped...
[11182.71s -> 11183.27s]  Oh, fuck.
[11183.91s -> 11184.47s]  Oh, fuck.
[11185.03s -> 11185.67s]  Please don't kill me.
[11187.73s -> 11188.37s]  Come on!
[11196.71s -> 11197.21s]  Got it.
[11210.63s -> 11215.57s]  Then we're gonna do another retelling of the story from the other side.
[11216.61s -> 11221.19s]  I got them all.
[11223.49s -> 11223.99s]  All right.
[11224.47s -> 11231.61s]  Executioner, deal some headshots without even aiming.
[11232.17s -> 11235.77s]  Pressing and holding Q will eat up all of your concentration
[11236.66s -> 11241.30s]  in exchange for marking nearby enemies for execution with perfect headshots.
[11241.30s -> 11244.42s]  The more concentration you sacrifice, the more of them will die.
[11245.14s -> 11252.36s]  So this is actually the dead eye from every...
[11254.46s -> 11255.66s]  Why is this the case?
[11259.62s -> 11261.46s]  Is there some lore or something behind
[11262.26s -> 11264.74s]  why every Western game has to have a slow down,
[11265.38s -> 11266.89s]  target everybody, and then...
[11268.89s -> 11271.00s]  That's in every single one of these.
[11272.07s -> 11272.63s]  Because it's cool.
[11272.63s -> 11275.19s]  I mean, it is cool, but it's in every single Western game.
[11275.75s -> 11283.27s]  There's nothing else we could do here?
[11283.27s -> 11295.34s]  It's a trope from the movies.
[11297.29s -> 11297.79s]  Yeah.
[11298.33s -> 11305.64s]  Well, let's do it.
[11306.76s -> 11308.44s]  And then we can get the golden rifle.
[11309.90s -> 11310.40s]  I got it.
[11314.52s -> 11315.48s]  I don't really care about these.
[11315.48s -> 11316.76s]  I'm not gonna use them.
[11316.76s -> 11319.32s]  So I got the two weapons I want,
[11320.04s -> 11320.68s]  which leads us...
[11320.68s -> 11321.48s]  Let's see what's over here.
[11321.48s -> 11322.84s]  Fast revolver reload.
[11323.96s -> 11325.08s]  Oh, I don't know.
[11325.08s -> 11325.96s]  I need to get one of these.
[11327.74s -> 11328.62s]  Silver shotgun.
[11329.34s -> 11334.92s]  We'll take a look later.
[11334.92s -> 11345.46s]  That's how the Wild West worked in real life.
[11345.46s -> 11346.66s]  That's how Billy the Kid died.
[11346.66s -> 11349.46s]  The sheriff slowed down time and blew his brains out.
[11349.46s -> 11350.26s]  Oh my God.
[11368.57s -> 11369.05s]  There it is.
[11369.05s -> 11369.55s]  Golden rifle.
[11371.05s -> 11371.45s]  Oh my God.
[11371.45s -> 11371.95s]  I love it.
[11376.71s -> 11383.91s]  Dude, it's an Australian rifle.
[11384.55s -> 11386.47s]  It is kind of an Australian rifle, isn't it?
[11387.27s -> 11392.31s]  Does it make a different noise?
[11392.95s -> 11393.75s]  I mean, it looks cool.
[11397.64s -> 11398.60s]  I'm not gonna shoot this.
[11418.97s -> 11420.65s]  I gotta change the title of this stream.
[11420.65s -> 11422.25s]  That was funny for like 30 seconds.
[11424.25s -> 11426.09s]  It was tough to stay on a true course.
[11426.81s -> 11429.05s]  So we kept an eye out for landmarks.
[11429.05s -> 11432.58s]  Okay, gotta go towards the bandanas.
[11438.79s -> 11440.07s]  I don't know what the title is, though.
[11440.63s -> 11444.12s]  It was never funny.
[11444.12s -> 11444.84s]  I thought it was funny.
[11447.78s -> 11449.86s]  We can disagree on what we think is funny.
[11465.48s -> 11467.56s]  Just name it trope.
[11480.89s -> 11481.61s]  What the fuck?
[11487.64s -> 11489.32s]  Fog and swamps hinder orientation.
[11489.32s -> 11490.76s]  The waypoint indicator is disabled.
[11491.40s -> 11494.28s]  Great.
[11494.28s -> 11495.40s]  I got a waypoint right here.
[11498.36s -> 11501.00s]  I'm gonna get ambushed in a second.
[11503.72s -> 11504.28s]  This watch.
[11508.39s -> 11508.63s]  No.
[11509.35s -> 11512.14s]  I really thought they were gonna come out of the shadows.
[11512.78s -> 11517.78s]  I'll take a secret.
[11517.78s -> 11518.74s]  Oh, there we go.
[11518.74s -> 11519.06s]  All right.
[11520.97s -> 11522.81s]  Oh, what the hell do I want to do here?
[11522.81s -> 11528.70s]  Yeah, I guess we could go up and then here for more combos.
[11529.34s -> 11537.35s]  Plus, that's just...
[11537.35s -> 11538.31s]  I can take more hits.
[11540.87s -> 11541.94s]  We'll go up here.
[11549.38s -> 11549.86s]  I got it.
[11550.58s -> 11552.66s]  I already did it.
[11552.66s -> 11553.46s]  What?
[11553.46s -> 11556.78s]  That was weird.
[11556.94s -> 11559.37s]  Okay, I'll go this way.
[11564.10s -> 11566.18s]  I was looking a little...
[11566.90s -> 11568.90s]  You know, this game is more than any...
[11570.33s -> 11571.93s]  If I look over at my other monitor,
[11573.13s -> 11576.25s]  that chat or at like streamlabs for a second,
[11576.25s -> 11577.53s]  I always time it.
[11578.09s -> 11581.61s]  So somehow I'm looking over to a different monitor
[11581.61s -> 11584.09s]  when one of these guys pops up and wants me to press S.
[11599.78s -> 11610.71s]  Okay, that's ridiculous.
[11611.27s -> 11612.47s]  That is so insane.
[11612.87s -> 11613.43s]  I don't even...
[11613.43s -> 11614.95s]  You don't have to see anybody.
[11614.95s -> 11616.71s]  I don't even have to aim at anyone.
[11616.71s -> 11618.47s]  It does it in 180 degrees.
[11630.65s -> 11632.09s]  Why would I pick up any of these, really?
[11644.63s -> 11645.19s]  Shotgunner.
[11645.75s -> 11647.67s]  Why do these guys have beat-em-up names now?
[11648.47s -> 11652.33s]  Can I not?
[11652.33s -> 11652.65s]  What's...
[11652.65s -> 11653.05s]  What the hell?
[11653.05s -> 11653.93s]  Why can I not hit Q?
[11654.57s -> 11656.01s]  Do I have to be a full bar?
[11656.89s -> 11658.39s]  I can't just slow it down at all?
[11659.03s -> 11659.67s]  Oh, there we go.
[11659.67s -> 11660.31s]  That was weird.
[11678.92s -> 11680.44s]  Okay, and...
[11683.02s -> 11683.34s]  What?
[11683.34s -> 11684.70s]  Oh my god, he has extra health.
[11685.26s -> 11699.38s]  To be seen.
[11704.36s -> 11705.48s]  Where are they coming from?
[11706.12s -> 11708.94s]  Do you guys see this?
[11709.90s -> 11710.46s]  Oh, throw...
[11717.72s -> 11718.20s]  Down here.
[11719.08s -> 11719.88s]  Blow this shit up.
[11721.35s -> 11722.23s]  That guy's giant.
[11723.40s -> 11724.52s]  Look at how huge that guy is.
[11724.52s -> 11725.64s]  Oh no, no, no.
[11725.64s -> 11725.96s]  He is.
[11725.96s -> 11726.60s]  Is he huge?
[11727.32s -> 11728.58s]  He's as big as the house.
[11729.38s -> 11735.69s]  I wasn't crazy right there, right?
[11735.69s -> 11736.73s]  That guy was gigantic.
[11737.96s -> 11745.27s]  He was...
[11745.27s -> 11747.11s]  Oh, okay, that was really weird.
[11747.11s -> 11748.07s]  He looked very big.
[11748.71s -> 11759.91s]  Let's just get in there with actual weapons, please.
[11760.55s -> 11761.27s]  That would be nice.
[11765.85s -> 11767.45s]  Just ended up falling inside.
[11768.09s -> 11770.17s]  So, how did you get out?
[11770.17s -> 11771.77s]  The barn doors was open.
[11771.77s -> 11774.25s]  About right then, I saw some suspicious characters
[11774.25s -> 11775.69s]  running through the bushes.
[11775.69s -> 11778.23s]  Of course, I followed them.
[11778.23s -> 11779.75s]  Oh, I got one of them.
[11779.75s -> 11782.47s]  That goddamn swamp was like a goddamn maze
[11782.47s -> 11789.08s]  and pretty soon, I had no goddamn idea where I was.
[11789.08s -> 11789.40s]  Dave?
[11792.60s -> 11793.56s]  Chat, you still with me?
[11793.56s -> 11795.72s]  So I just started walking and pretty soon...
[11799.58s -> 11801.18s]  I think they're getting bored of the game.
[11804.15s -> 11804.79s]  Dave?
[11804.79s -> 11812.58s]  Steve?
[11812.58s -> 11815.22s]  Indians surrounded me from all sides.
[11817.22s -> 11817.62s]  Did they?
[11833.50s -> 11834.62s]  I want to play.
[11834.62s -> 11835.10s]  Stop it.
[11835.10s -> 11837.42s]  I just wanted to make sure Steve was paying attention.
[11838.30s -> 11839.66s]  Now, where was I?
[11839.66s -> 11842.04s]  You were following through a swamp?
[11843.26s -> 11844.14s]  That's right.
[11844.14s -> 11845.26s]  See, Steve?
[11845.26s -> 11846.78s]  Dwight's paying attention.
[11846.78s -> 11847.98s]  Oh, I'm listening.
[11847.98s -> 11850.54s]  I was just resting my eyes.
[11850.54s -> 11853.85s]  Oh, was I?
[11855.59s -> 11856.55s]  Right.
[11856.55s -> 11858.22s]  See, there's a reason...
[11858.22s -> 11859.90s]  Just a bunch of old men talking.
[11859.90s -> 11861.43s]  ...made up of brothers.
[11861.43s -> 11864.23s]  Being a brother is a very sacred thing.
[11864.23s -> 11865.99s]  It's a bond like no other.
[11868.39s -> 11874.25s]  So did you ever find the damn Daltons?
[11874.25s -> 11877.34s]  Not yet, but I did find a few of their cousins.
[11879.18s -> 11880.78s]  I swear to god, video games are not even good.
[11882.30s -> 11896.31s]  That guy's dynamite on his chest?
[11908.94s -> 11910.86s]  All right.
[11910.86s -> 11911.82s]  That's the way we're gonna go.
[11912.46s -> 11916.02s]  I thought I got two of them in a row.
[11916.02s -> 11917.30s]  I thought it went right through their ears.
[11918.10s -> 11923.53s]  Come on.
[11923.53s -> 11923.93s]  Quickly.
[11923.93s -> 11924.49s]  Anybody else?
[11926.63s -> 11927.67s]  Oh, shit.
[11927.67s -> 11929.03s]  That guy has a magic door.
[11929.83s -> 11931.72s]  Whoa, whoa.
[11931.72s -> 11932.44s]  Easy, easy, easy.
[11944.98s -> 11945.54s]  I got him.
[11945.54s -> 11946.18s]  I think I did it.
[11946.74s -> 11949.88s]  I wish I could grab the door.
[11950.60s -> 11951.16s]  That'd be fun.
[11951.72s -> 11962.36s]  This exact location is insecure.
[11962.92s -> 11967.75s]  There's a lady up here.
[11967.75s -> 11969.03s]  There's a guy lying down right there.
[11969.75s -> 11975.27s]  I just really...
[11975.83s -> 11977.51s]  Just talk about deja vu.
[11978.23s -> 11978.63s]  That is...
[11979.35s -> 11980.31s]  Okay, what is hitting me?
[11981.11s -> 11990.30s]  Uh-oh.
[11990.30s -> 11991.18s]  I shouldn't be up here.
[11997.72s -> 11998.84s]  I have full ammo with that gun.
[12003.64s -> 12004.12s]  That's it?
[12007.75s -> 12008.87s]  I guess I have full ammo.
[12009.51s -> 12019.38s]  I don't think I got him.
[12019.38s -> 12029.54s]  It's fun to do that, but it takes too many bullets.
[12029.54s -> 12035.32s]  Have I seen the new game about me on Steam?
[12036.28s -> 12037.88s]  Yeah, we played it on stream, actually.
[12039.66s -> 12040.70s]  We played it on stream.
[12044.30s -> 12045.74s]  Oh, fuck.
[12045.74s -> 12056.07s]  I'm dead.
[12056.07s -> 12059.03s]  Of course, the guy with the health pool is the one that I couldn't see.
[12059.03s -> 12062.39s]  He blended in with the bushes because he has like a fucking green coat on.
[12063.35s -> 12093.61s]  Where the fuck are these people?
[12093.61s -> 12094.57s]  Like, where the fuck are you?
[12095.37s -> 12096.17s]  Is this guy here?
[12104.33s -> 12104.89s]  Stop dying.
[12104.89s -> 12106.33s]  It's pissing me off.
[12106.33s -> 12114.86s]  Where's the shotgun guy?
[12114.86s -> 12116.14s]  He's like in there.
[12116.78s -> 12121.27s]  Where is he?
[12121.91s -> 12125.43s]  Look at that.
[12131.19s -> 12134.12s]  Together against anyone who would threaten him.
[12134.84s -> 12137.51s]  That was like inside of this tree.
[12143.51s -> 12145.35s]  Another boss fight, I think, coming up here.
[12145.35s -> 12149.50s]  Let's load the guns.
[12151.50s -> 12151.90s]  Oh, fuck.
[12151.90s -> 12152.94s]  I gotta change the title.
[12153.50s -> 12164.25s]  That's when I saw it.
[12164.25s -> 12166.68s]  A damn steamboat.
[12166.68s -> 12167.80s]  A steamboat?
[12167.80s -> 12169.40s]  In a swamp?
[12169.40s -> 12171.96s]  Yeah, Steve, but this wasn't much more than a wreck.
[12171.96s -> 12173.72s]  This looks like Borderlands.
[12173.72s -> 12174.28s]  That's not even...
[12174.28s -> 12176.20s]  Oh, my fucking god.
[12176.20s -> 12177.24s]  I didn't know what to do.
[12177.24s -> 12180.12s]  Yes, it floated over in the flood of 85.
[12180.12s -> 12180.60s]  Stretching.
[12181.40s -> 12184.76s]  Now, was it a stern wheeler or a sad wheeler?
[12184.76s -> 12188.26s]  What does that really make a difference, Steve?
[12188.26s -> 12193.03s]  It was a steamboat with a goddamn army on board.
[12193.03s -> 12194.87s]  It was in that a few salaud of bullets
[12194.87s -> 12198.04s]  come arraigning down small vigilantes
[12198.04s -> 12205.74s]  and cuffed those men that were shooting at me.
[12205.74s -> 12207.34s]  I saw some familiar faces.
[12208.98s -> 12209.48s]  That it?
[12210.74s -> 12211.86s]  There's probably a secret in here.
[12211.86s -> 12213.46s]  I would be shocked if there wasn't.
[12214.18s -> 12223.00s]  Where's it going?
[12223.56s -> 12224.20s]  That was odd.
[12225.37s -> 12226.33s]  Teleporting bullets.
[12226.97s -> 12230.82s]  Let's get up there.
[12231.38s -> 12245.69s]  Can I get in?
[12246.25s -> 12246.89s]  Climb?
[12247.61s -> 12249.61s]  A nugget.
[12254.70s -> 12255.42s]  Might be up top.
[12256.52s -> 12260.01s]  Yeah, it's probably on the edge.
[12268.52s -> 12269.00s]  Oh, my god.
[12269.00s -> 12269.80s]  That guy has a shotgun.
[12270.52s -> 12271.72s]  I set out to do so.
[12273.50s -> 12275.18s]  Surrender just ain't in my nature.
[12276.50s -> 12278.26s]  Plus, I'm stubborn as hell.
[12278.26s -> 12284.54s]  I mean, this is effective, too.
[12286.07s -> 12287.59s]  Don't always have to aim down sights.
[12288.31s -> 12289.54s]  You can just shoot them.
[12302.89s -> 12308.20s]  Gotta go that way.
[12314.46s -> 12316.38s]  That's why it's so goddamn fun.
[12318.76s -> 12319.56s]  It is very fun.
[12322.23s -> 12323.59s]  There are other game modes, too.
[12324.23s -> 12325.77s]  We gotta try those out.
[12326.33s -> 12328.36s]  There's dual mode.
[12328.36s -> 12329.40s]  There's arcade mode.
[12331.66s -> 12332.86s]  It's not just the story,
[12332.86s -> 12334.06s]  so there's a little bit more to see
[12334.94s -> 12335.90s]  once I complete the game.
[12338.50s -> 12340.18s]  Which I don't know exactly where I am
[12340.18s -> 12341.14s]  in the story right now, but
[12341.78s -> 12344.23s]  we'll find out, right?
[12354.90s -> 12355.40s]  Well.
[12368.81s -> 12370.73s]  After months of dogged pursuit.
[12372.70s -> 12373.26s]  Let's do it.
[12376.74s -> 12377.86s]  Oh, the double cross.
[12389.90s -> 12390.70s]  It's burning down.
[12390.70s -> 12391.66s]  I have to get out of the burning.
[12406.95s -> 12407.91s]  I'm going up.
[12407.91s -> 12409.43s]  I don't think I should be going up the stairs.
[12409.43s -> 12410.87s]  Am I gonna need to go down the stairs?
[12417.96s -> 12419.08s]  This is so dumb.
[12423.02s -> 12423.74s]  Oh, God.
[12436.42s -> 12436.98s]  I got up.
[12440.60s -> 12441.40s]  What the fuck?
[12452.84s -> 12453.24s]  All that.
[12453.24s -> 12455.24s]  We got a lot of information there very quickly.
[12455.96s -> 12461.00s]  I'm gonna get a lot of experience here.
[12469.03s -> 12474.22s]  19, 20, 22, 23.
[12475.26s -> 12477.10s]  Dude, these are like flaming hot Cheetos.
[12478.33s -> 12480.57s]  That's where I am in my combo right now.
[12481.21s -> 12484.90s]  I'm at flaming hot Cheeto level.
[12485.54s -> 12490.10s]  Come on, is that it?
[12490.66s -> 12491.30s]  33?
[12492.02s -> 12493.93s]  I think that's it.
[12495.27s -> 12496.31s]  No, this guy right here.
[12497.35s -> 12498.07s]  Oh, it's okay.
[12498.87s -> 12500.33s]  It's all right.
[12500.33s -> 12500.81s]  I got 33.
[12506.04s -> 12507.24s]  Oh, God.
[12511.98s -> 12513.18s]  How am I gonna do this?
[12513.18s -> 12514.06s]  The guy in the back?
[12523.37s -> 12524.17s]  No, no.
[12525.13s -> 12530.60s]  Did it.
[12533.19s -> 12533.69s]  Oh.
[12541.72s -> 12542.44s]  Who was the guy in the back?
[12542.44s -> 12542.92s]  I got it right.
[12552.74s -> 12555.22s]  So how do you dishonorably kill somebody?
[12555.22s -> 12558.02s]  You just shoot them without waiting for them to shoot first?
[12558.02s -> 12558.66s]  To pull first?
[12569.03s -> 12569.91s]  Yeah, okay, I see.
[12574.01s -> 12574.73s]  More combos.
[12575.37s -> 12576.50s]  I'm gonna do it again.
[12577.38s -> 12577.94s]  But hold on.
[12578.42s -> 12579.86s]  I want to see what's further down this tree.
[12585.08s -> 12586.28s]  Cold rage.
[12586.28s -> 12587.80s]  Damaging concentration.
[12593.08s -> 12594.36s]  Reload while sprinting.
[12594.36s -> 12595.48s]  That's actually really good.
[12599.53s -> 12601.37s]  Yeah, I think I want that.
[12601.37s -> 12602.17s]  I'm moving around a lot.
[12603.21s -> 12604.41s]  I'd run around all over the place.
[12605.05s -> 12606.84s]  This game looks super fun.
[12606.84s -> 12607.56s]  Is it a blast?
[12607.56s -> 12608.28s]  Yeah, it's fun.
[12611.80s -> 12614.14s]  I'm actually glad I get to play it.
[12614.14s -> 12615.98s]  Tried to play this like two years ago on stream
[12615.98s -> 12617.98s]  and then gave up on it because I couldn't get it to work.
[12618.54s -> 12619.77s]  And here we are now.
[12621.26s -> 12621.90s]  I want to get this.
[12622.54s -> 12623.90s]  So I'm gonna go down this way.
[12625.26s -> 12627.96s]  I don't want this sprinting reload.
[12627.96s -> 12636.95s]  Am I gonna change the stream title?
[12636.95s -> 12637.27s]  Yes.
[12637.91s -> 12639.59s]  After I get out of this.
[12645.08s -> 12645.80s]  Episode 7.
[12645.80s -> 12646.84s]  The Wild Bunch.
[12647.88s -> 12649.24s]  Juarez, 1868.
[12669.40s -> 12670.12s]  Couldn't lose.
[12670.68s -> 12674.52s]  I even want an old Spanish coin that had to be 100 years old.
[12674.52s -> 12676.68s]  We want ads later.
[12676.68s -> 12677.24s]  Not right now.
[12677.88s -> 12682.44s]  I was mighty pleased with myself the next morning as my brothers and I rode for Texas.
[12683.56s -> 12687.24s]  But before we crossed the border, those cowboys caught up with us.
[12688.20s -> 12692.92s]  It was Johnny Ringo, Roscoe Bob Bryant, and another asshole named Jim.
[12693.56s -> 12696.60s]  They wanted their money back and everything else we had.
[12697.24s -> 12701.74s]  Include maps, as those boys didn't want us coming for them later.
[12702.46s -> 12705.34s]  Bob put that old Spanish coin in my mouth and said,
[12706.22s -> 12709.34s]  I won't have it said that I left you with nothing, boy.
[12709.98s -> 12712.12s]  Am I gonna play Dreams with PS4?
[12713.32s -> 12713.56s]  Yeah.
[12714.68s -> 12716.20s]  I'm really excited for it, actually.
[12716.20s -> 12717.32s]  I've been looking forward to it.
[12717.32s -> 12720.36s]  The branch finally snapped under the weight of the three of us.
[12720.36s -> 12722.84s]  But being my older brothers was bigger and heavier.
[12723.48s -> 12724.60s]  They were already dead.
[12725.32s -> 12728.87s]  Right then I swore to myself that I would avenge them.
[12730.46s -> 12737.69s]  Ringo, you know, until I heard he was riding with the Wild Bunch.
[12747.32s -> 12750.76s]  I thought it was in like super, super early access.
[12753.78s -> 12756.18s]  Like you have to get invited to play it early access.
[12758.74s -> 12759.14s]  I don't know.
[12759.14s -> 12760.02s]  I thought that was the case.
[12760.02s -> 12761.38s]  I've been on their trail for months.
[12761.38s -> 12764.26s]  Ever since they left their hideout in the Bighorn Mountains.
[12766.01s -> 12766.89s]  All right.
[12766.89s -> 12768.01s]  So give me one second.
[12768.57s -> 12769.21s]  I'm going to...
[12770.09s -> 12770.65s]  I'm gonna pee.
[12771.69s -> 12774.01s]  Because I drank a bunch of fucking water.
[12775.24s -> 12776.84s]  And then I'm gonna finish this game.
[12776.84s -> 12778.76s]  It seems like I think we're almost at the end, right?
[12778.76s -> 12779.88s]  Another like three or four missions.
[12780.90s -> 12782.42s]  And then I'm gonna do the duels
[12782.42s -> 12784.26s]  and then the arcade mode play for a little while longer.
[12784.82s -> 12789.82s]  I'm gonna change the title of this stream to Juarez.
[12790.46s -> 12799.00s]  And that's the title.
[12801.93s -> 12804.73s]  Just Juarez and then like a dot.
[12805.37s -> 12808.17s]  I'm right back.
[12808.81s -> 13047.22s]  And I'm back.
[13047.22s -> 13047.78s]  Let's keep going.
[13055.64s -> 13058.82s]  I choked that up too much.
[13058.82s -> 13069.64s]  Fuck.
[13069.64s -> 13070.52s]  More beer.
[13071.88s -> 13073.16s]  It's not beer.
[13073.16s -> 13081.75s]  No, it's pineapple juice.
[13081.75s -> 13085.00s]  I'm a huge pineapple guy.
[13085.00s -> 13086.44s]  If you guys didn't know this.
[13086.44s -> 13090.01s]  Pineapple juice.
[13090.01s -> 13091.05s]  Pineapple slices.
[13091.05s -> 13092.33s]  Pineapple flavoring.
[13092.33s -> 13103.37s]  Except get that shit off pizza.
[13103.37s -> 13104.17s]  Yeah, I see you.
[13104.81s -> 13107.91s]  How are you?
[13107.91s -> 13110.15s]  Somebody heard that as they were driving by.
[13110.15s -> 13112.74s]  I think I'm really fucking mad.
[13112.74s -> 13120.55s]  I'm just kidding.
[13120.55s -> 13121.91s]  I love pineapple.
[13121.91s -> 13122.31s]  I just...
[13122.31s -> 13123.27s]  I love pineapple.
[13123.27s -> 13125.35s]  It's my favorite fruit ever.
[13125.35s -> 13126.47s]  It's better than apples.
[13126.47s -> 13127.35s]  It's better than pears.
[13127.35s -> 13128.39s]  Better than oranges.
[13128.39s -> 13130.50s]  I just don't like it on my pizza.
[13130.50s -> 13130.90s]  My...
[13130.90s -> 13132.26s]  I like pepperoni pizza.
[13132.26s -> 13133.06s]  That's it.
[13133.06s -> 13134.47s]  I don't like anything else.
[13135.19s -> 13137.03s]  I don't really, you know, meat lovers too much.
[13137.03s -> 13138.15s]  Just pepperoni.
[13138.15s -> 13140.15s]  With a flat crispy thin crust.
[13144.79s -> 13145.27s]  God damn it.
[13145.27s -> 13145.91s]  Now I want that.
[13151.03s -> 13152.63s]  You don't deserve pizza.
[13152.63s -> 13153.11s]  Jesus.
[13154.81s -> 13155.29s]  Why?
[13156.49s -> 13157.13s]  How do you...
[13157.13s -> 13158.89s]  How do you deserve pizza?
[13158.89s -> 13159.69s]  You just buy it.
[13166.06s -> 13169.42s]  Besides, I wanted Bryant all to myself.
[13170.38s -> 13172.81s]  I'd heard about a large shipment of gold
[13172.81s -> 13175.13s]  being transported to Wilcox, Wyoming
[13175.13s -> 13176.41s]  on the Overland Flyer.
[13177.66s -> 13179.58s]  I figured the Wild Bunch would likely
[13179.58s -> 13180.62s]  hit such a treasure.
[13180.62s -> 13182.46s]  And by God, I figured right.
[13183.10s -> 13184.46s]  Don't eat too much pineapple, though.
[13184.46s -> 13185.34s]  It has bromelain in it.
[13186.14s -> 13188.25s]  That's why your mouth hurts when you eat it.
[13188.89s -> 13206.41s]  No, that's real.
[13206.41s -> 13206.81s]  That's real.
[13206.81s -> 13208.09s]  They threw the bridge with the intention
[13208.09s -> 13209.53s]  of forcing the train to stop.
[13212.97s -> 13215.13s]  Well, I assume the Wild Bunch was likely
[13215.13s -> 13218.17s]  in the still intact part of the train high above.
[13218.17s -> 13220.17s]  So I had no choice but to make my way up.
[13220.17s -> 13220.97s]  This is a cool mission.
[13220.97s -> 13222.33s]  Your car is dangling down.
[13224.95s -> 13226.31s]  Pineapple eats you.
[13226.31s -> 13226.87s]  Yes, it does.
[13229.26s -> 13229.74s]  Oh, God.
[13234.18s -> 13236.34s]  Weirdly enough, yes, there's an enzyme
[13236.34s -> 13238.82s]  in pineapple that is a flesh-eating enzyme.
[13238.82s -> 13240.18s]  And it is eating your flesh
[13240.18s -> 13241.14s]  while you put it in your mouth
[13241.14s -> 13242.58s]  and in your body and stuff.
[13242.58s -> 13243.94s]  But it's actually kind of good for you.
[13243.94s -> 13244.82s]  Just don't eat too much.
[13261.61s -> 13262.25s]  Oh, okay.
[13262.25s -> 13264.33s]  So I knew I was headed in the right direction.
[13266.52s -> 13267.72s]  Did I miss a cool thing?
[13268.44s -> 13269.80s]  I just wasn't paying attention.
[13269.80s -> 13270.04s]  What?
[13271.16s -> 13272.76s]  Wait, rewind.
[13272.76s -> 13273.72s]  Tell the story again.
[13273.72s -> 13275.16s]  Somebody else tell a different version of it.
[13293.86s -> 13295.22s]  What the hell is what you say?
[13295.78s -> 13299.37s]  I had to negotiate an even more precarious route.
[13299.37s -> 13300.22s]  Oh, no.
[13300.22s -> 13301.34s]  I got shot in the head.
[13301.34s -> 13302.06s]  What the hell?
[13302.86s -> 13306.58s]  To get my ass out of there.
[13306.58s -> 13309.32s]  He's going to shoot the horse, calling it now.
[13310.12s -> 13310.44s]  Nope.
[13312.50s -> 13313.30s]  Not going to do that.
[13313.86s -> 13317.64s]  Thought I was going to do that, too.
[13322.62s -> 13325.74s]  Um, you think that's too easy for me to do that.
[13325.74s -> 13327.34s]  But like, oh, look at how crazy that is.
[13344.14s -> 13345.18s]  Are you happy?
[13345.18s -> 13345.74s]  Are you happy?
[13346.54s -> 13347.66s]  Like, I did the stupid thing.
[13368.92s -> 13370.04s]  Limited train robbers.
[13371.48s -> 13373.22s]  Let's try to get some points here.
[13387.03s -> 13387.35s]  No.
[13390.79s -> 13391.59s]  Oh, right here.
[13395.88s -> 13399.16s]  Too busy dodging bullets to worry about falling to my death.
[13399.72s -> 13405.54s]  Odds were I was likely to die that day anyway.
[13405.54s -> 13406.34s]  Oh, god damn it.
[13406.34s -> 13414.06s]  I was determined to take down as many of those bastards as I could.
[13414.06s -> 13414.94s]  It's a little ledge.
[13414.94s -> 13415.58s]  It's tiny.
[13415.58s -> 13416.46s]  Come on, give me a break.
[13424.14s -> 13424.46s]  Who?
[13437.99s -> 13438.63s]  That was a cool move.
[13438.63s -> 13439.27s]  I didn't even do that.
[13439.27s -> 13440.07s]  He did it on his own.
[13447.58s -> 13449.50s]  Uh, do I have to go back on the outside?
[13451.64s -> 13452.60s]  This doesn't open.
[13452.60s -> 13454.44s]  I guess I can go this way.
[13455.16s -> 13458.70s]  Like shooting ducks in a shooting gallery.
[13458.70s -> 13462.92s]  Only difference is he's damn duck shot back.
[13462.92s -> 13464.84s]  Okay, they were just in the way.
[13464.84s -> 13465.72s]  I didn't even do that.
[13465.72s -> 13468.52s]  Somebody else fell on top of it with a match in their hand.
[13476.55s -> 13485.56s]  Um, secret.
[13485.56s -> 13486.06s]  All right.
[13486.60s -> 13491.53s]  All right, back around the corner and go up.
[13519.29s -> 13520.49s]  Joe, Jeff, and Tim.
[13523.26s -> 13525.18s]  Grand Posse versus the Wild Bunch.
[13525.74s -> 13529.06s]  Here it comes.
[13529.06s -> 13529.86s]  You've been waiting for this.
[13533.29s -> 13539.03s]  I had to fight the Wild Bunch all bonesome, as usual.
[13539.03s -> 13541.05s]  Oh, well that's great.
[13542.57s -> 13543.37s]  Oh, one dead.
[13545.21s -> 13546.25s]  Okay, another Wild Boy.
[13547.45s -> 13548.57s]  All the Wild Boys dead.
[13549.21s -> 13550.09s]  Wouldn't even that hard.
[13550.09s -> 13551.13s]  It was actually pretty easy.
[13577.35s -> 13578.54s]  Nugget.
[13578.54s -> 13578.78s]  Where?
[13579.58s -> 13582.79s]  On the outside of the train maybe?
[13582.79s -> 13583.35s]  I don't know.
[13583.35s -> 13585.99s]  Outside, left, right, down, up.
[13586.63s -> 13604.20s]  Whoa, he's alive.
[13613.06s -> 13613.94s]  Right next to me.
[13613.94s -> 13614.98s]  It's inside the...
[13615.06s -> 13615.46s]  That was...
[13615.46s -> 13616.90s]  They made that really easy to find that.
[13617.62s -> 13622.59s]  What was that?
[13627.77s -> 13629.43s]  Chase the Wild Bunch.
[13629.43s -> 13630.07s]  Does that have money?
[13632.10s -> 13648.65s]  Points given to me.
[13649.21s -> 13650.18s]  I want more levels.
[13661.03s -> 13662.07s]  Um, was it...
[13662.07s -> 13662.55s]  They're in...
[13662.55s -> 13663.27s]  Okay, I can't...
[13664.07s -> 13664.79s]  Get off it, get off.
[13664.79s -> 13665.75s]  Just get off it and hide.
[13668.78s -> 13670.46s]  What a stupid fucking idea that was.
[13671.26s -> 13678.79s]  That was the dumbest idea I've ever had.
[13685.77s -> 13686.27s]  Duck?
[13692.17s -> 13694.89s]  Determined to finally have my justice.
[13694.89s -> 13699.21s]  But the only survivor who welcomed me was George Flatnose Curry.
[13699.21s -> 13699.85s]  Who was he?
[13700.89s -> 13702.73s]  The fastest gun in the gang.
[13702.73s -> 13703.53s]  Great.
[13703.53s -> 13704.97s]  Right after Sundance, I mean.
[13706.30s -> 13707.58s]  And Kid Curry.
[13707.58s -> 13708.78s]  And maybe Elsie Lay.
[13710.06s -> 13711.90s]  Though some folks might dispute that.
[13714.54s -> 13722.02s]  Uh, you gonna go for it?
[13722.02s -> 13722.82s]  Who's gonna go for it?
[13727.64s -> 13729.16s]  I shot that fucking ground.
[13742.01s -> 13743.29s]  He stops right here for a second
[13743.29s -> 13745.29s]  so I can get a good focus right here.
[13745.93s -> 13751.78s]  This is gonna be bad.
[13752.50s -> 13756.25s]  I've already fucked it up but I think I can still get it.
[13758.66s -> 13759.30s]  I shot him!
[13759.94s -> 13765.32s]  I shot him right in the...
[13765.32s -> 13767.56s]  Does he have a bulletproof vest on?
[13767.56s -> 13768.44s]  What the fuck was that?
[13769.24s -> 13778.82s]  This is gonna be it.
[13813.50s -> 13814.22s]  What happened there?
[13817.24s -> 13818.20s]  What happened there?
[13819.00s -> 13827.54s]  As long as I stay above 50%.
[13829.06s -> 13831.46s]  That means I had the majority of accuracy, right?
[13848.86s -> 13849.34s]  All right.
[13849.34s -> 13853.50s]  I tried to find Bob, Brian, but it was as if he'd disappeared.
[13853.50s -> 13857.00s]  Sometime later, I heard The Wild Back together.
[13857.00s -> 13860.68s]  Kid Curry escaped from jail and now he was running the whole shebang.
[13861.24s -> 13862.76s]  So I took to their trail.
[13862.76s -> 13863.96s]  I like how it still does the story.
[13863.96s -> 13867.72s]  I was still in pursuit of my brother's killer and hoped that he was back with him.
[13867.72s -> 13868.84s]  Now what did I want to do here?
[13869.64s -> 13870.60s]  What did I actually want to do?
[13871.32s -> 13872.12s]  It was over here, right?
[13872.84s -> 13873.56s]  Oh, there I am.
[13873.56s -> 13874.68s]  Sprinting reload.
[13876.12s -> 13893.74s]  Okay.
[13897.38s -> 13897.62s]  Got.
[13899.96s -> 13900.44s]  Reload.
[13916.58s -> 13917.14s]  How many other?
[13919.46s -> 13919.70s]  All right.
[13919.70s -> 13921.14s]  I'm gonna get one, two, three, four.
[13922.66s -> 13928.15s]  The barrel's not a person.
[13928.95s -> 13930.47s]  Just in case you were wondering.
[13945.11s -> 13950.23s]  At least I got...
[13950.23s -> 13952.23s]  Because there was might have been a guy hiding in the barrel.
[13952.95s -> 13955.21s]  That would be possible, right?
[13958.25s -> 13958.89s]  Kid Curry.
[13958.89s -> 13961.37s]  I could sense him close by, however.
[13961.37s -> 13963.40s]  Not in some nasty.
[13963.40s -> 13965.80s]  I just needed a clue as to their whereabouts.
[13972.60s -> 13973.16s]  Clues?
[13978.73s -> 13980.81s]  Find clues as to the whereabouts of the...
[13980.81s -> 13982.01s]  How about the map that they drew?
[13982.01s -> 13982.89s]  I found one.
[13982.89s -> 13989.10s]  This time they were fixing to blow up a train trestle.
[13989.74s -> 13991.34s]  Property of the Union Pacific.
[13992.14s -> 14003.30s]  Indicated how they were fixing to undermine several of the weakest wooden support.
[14003.30s -> 14004.18s]  This isn't another game.
[14004.90s -> 14016.68s]  This isn't another game.
[14016.68s -> 14017.56s]  What game is this in?
[14020.49s -> 14023.93s]  Kid Curry was considered the wild in the Wild Bunch.
[14023.93s -> 14027.77s]  It was said that he fathered 85 bastard children.
[14027.77s -> 14030.09s]  Though some say it was only five.
[14030.09s -> 14030.57s]  Gun.
[14030.57s -> 14030.89s]  Gun.
[14030.89s -> 14031.13s]  Right.
[14031.13s -> 14031.61s]  Okay.
[14031.61s -> 14031.85s]  Yeah.
[14032.89s -> 14035.02s]  What happened to my weapons?
[14035.02s -> 14035.98s]  Why did it take...
[14035.98s -> 14038.38s]  It took away my cool weapons and gave me shitty ones.
[14039.02s -> 14039.88s]  All right.
[14039.88s -> 14041.00s]  Prevent them from blowing it up.
[14041.80s -> 14042.76s]  I'll do my best.
[14043.48s -> 14046.95s]  Did I have a beep gun?
[14047.59s -> 14048.23s]  I don't remember.
[14050.63s -> 14051.03s]  Did I?
[14051.83s -> 14052.55s]  I don't think so.
[14060.31s -> 14062.07s]  Kid Curry had bragged to a whore
[14062.07s -> 14065.83s]  how he was going to rob a train heading to the U.S. Mint in Denver.
[14065.83s -> 14068.55s]  And that whore, Fat Sally, she told me.
[14072.06s -> 14074.22s]  The bridge was rigged with dynamite.
[14074.22s -> 14077.42s]  So I decided I best be careful confronting those bastards.
[14079.34s -> 14082.22s]  One misplaced shot and that could easily have happened.
[14084.10s -> 14085.62s]  That wasn't like for a joke or anything.
[14085.62s -> 14087.14s]  I just wanted to see if it actually did that.
[14088.10s -> 14090.74s]  I didn't know if that was just like a joke for like...
[14091.86s -> 14092.90s]  Okay, you can disarm them.
[14092.90s -> 14093.38s]  I didn't know.
[14093.38s -> 14094.74s]  I just was seeing if it actually did.
[14095.30s -> 14097.94s]  ...to remove any dynamite that I came across.
[14097.94s -> 14101.66s]  Or I saw a ladder that somehow had escaped my attention.
[14101.66s -> 14102.46s]  Don't you blow us up now.
[14102.46s -> 14103.58s]  Don't worry, I know...
[14120.58s -> 14121.86s]  No, don't do that.
[14123.06s -> 14124.50s]  It's going to take us all out.
[14124.50s -> 14125.54s]  Okay, I got to be careful.
[14139.82s -> 14141.02s]  Disarm, right?
[14141.02s -> 14141.50s]  Disarm.
[14142.30s -> 14143.42s]  Why can I not disarm?
[14153.13s -> 14155.37s]  That's what I'm saying is what I'm trying to do.
[14156.17s -> 14168.89s]  Once that was done, I figured I'd find...
[14168.89s -> 14170.17s]  Load, load, load, load, load, load.
[14175.42s -> 14176.46s]  Oh, right in the face.
[14177.34s -> 14185.69s]  Don't, don't blow up.
[14185.69s -> 14186.33s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[14186.33s -> 14187.37s]  Oh, God, did I blow it up?
[14188.41s -> 14189.21s]  Don't blow things up.
[14189.21s -> 14189.69s]  That's bad.
[14206.79s -> 14207.91s]  Armored shotgunner.
[14207.91s -> 14208.55s]  That's...
[14208.55s -> 14219.26s]  Did they get him?
[14224.18s -> 14231.14s]  That was scary.
[14236.25s -> 14236.97s]  Oh, God.
[14237.69s -> 14239.05s]  We have community subs just coming.
[14240.39s -> 14242.79s]  Jerma's average dong gave...
[14242.79s -> 14243.35s]  How was it?
[14243.35s -> 14244.15s]  10? 20?
[14244.15s -> 14244.55s]  How many?
[14244.55s -> 14245.11s]  I didn't see it.
[14246.07s -> 14247.91s]  Pixel Mike, five community subs.
[14247.91s -> 14248.95s]  Jerma's average dong.
[14249.85s -> 14250.73s]  Ten community subs.
[14251.37s -> 14252.01s]  Thank you, guys.
[14255.16s -> 14257.40s]  Thank you for the community subs.
[14257.40s -> 14258.12s]  You guys are awesome.
[14260.68s -> 14261.32s]  He said it.
[14262.58s -> 14264.02s]  Yes, he did.
[14264.74s -> 14266.97s]  Let's get me a new gun.
[14270.46s -> 14272.70s]  Increased range and piercing power.
[14272.70s -> 14275.02s]  It's now easier to hit what you're aiming at
[14275.58s -> 14278.47s]  and look good while you're doing it.
[14278.47s -> 14279.59s]  Be quick as greased lightning.
[14279.59s -> 14282.79s]  You'll be able to move and run 50% faster.
[14282.79s -> 14283.35s]  Let's get it.
[14284.23s -> 14286.22s]  So it's an engraved ranger.
[14286.78s -> 14289.50s]  So it's 25% range.
[14290.22s -> 14291.98s]  So it's better range, less recoil.
[14292.54s -> 14293.26s]  What's the other one?
[14294.46s -> 14297.10s]  This is faster fire rate and faster aim speed.
[14301.64s -> 14302.84s]  No, I don't have it.
[14302.84s -> 14311.93s]  Okay, well, let's shoot the rope.
[14325.51s -> 14326.71s]  No, I didn't get it all.
[14327.35s -> 14330.66s]  Oh, what?
[14330.66s -> 14337.03s]  That guy was just wood in my brain.
[14337.83s -> 14342.25s]  You should mention that.
[14342.25s -> 14346.63s]  Actually, there was a fourth charge impeding my progress.
[14347.67s -> 14353.83s]  Is that the last guy?
[14354.39s -> 14361.42s]  Once I removed it, my path was...
[14361.42s -> 14361.98s]  Ah, come on.
[14361.98s -> 14362.70s]  He was standing still.
[14364.14s -> 14364.86s]  What the fuck?
[14367.16s -> 14369.19s]  I thought I shot him twice.
[14377.54s -> 14378.82s]  I don't want these quick shooters.
[14378.82s -> 14379.38s]  They're terrible.
[14385.02s -> 14386.14s]  Don't blow those up.
[14387.02s -> 14388.22s]  Bad move, Jeremy.
[14388.22s -> 14389.18s]  Bad move.
[14390.06s -> 14398.97s]  Come on.
[14398.97s -> 14400.09s]  Come on, come on, come on.
[14400.09s -> 14400.59s]  Whoa.
[14412.01s -> 14414.17s]  The upgraded quick shooters are OP.
[14415.14s -> 14415.64s]  Are they?
[14421.16s -> 14423.64s]  Find an alternate path to reach the other part of the overpass.
[14427.38s -> 14427.88s]  Let's go.
[14431.40s -> 14432.20s]  Nugget.
[14432.20s -> 14435.53s]  Where the hell is it?
[14435.53s -> 14438.38s]  I think it's above me.
[14441.56s -> 14443.88s]  This place is cool, but I kind of want to get out of fucking Blighttown.
[14444.52s -> 14456.23s]  Where is it?
[14456.23s -> 14458.15s]  Is it down here?
[14458.87s -> 14465.51s]  Where's this thing?
[14470.12s -> 14470.76s]  It's right there.
[14471.40s -> 14474.20s]  Shit.
[14474.20s -> 14474.52s]  All right.
[14474.52s -> 14475.16s]  How do I get that?
[14475.72s -> 14478.54s]  It's right there.
[14478.54s -> 14478.78s]  All right.
[14478.78s -> 14480.38s]  I gotta go up and then down.
[14495.22s -> 14496.70s]  Good.
[14496.70s -> 14497.02s]  All right.
[14497.58s -> 14499.50s]  Find an alternate route.
[14501.86s -> 14503.14s]  So we gotta go that way.
[14504.09s -> 14505.37s]  So how do I get to there?
[14506.01s -> 14508.84s]  Can I just go down?
[14509.72s -> 14510.98s]  What happens if I go down?
[14511.62s -> 14514.26s]  Wait a minute.
[14514.26s -> 14517.26s]  I'm just gonna run over here.
[14517.98s -> 14523.82s]  I found a cave, and as I made my way back to the bridge,
[14523.82s -> 14524.62s]  I saw something that concerned me.
[14524.62s -> 14525.18s]  Oh, God.
[14526.14s -> 14528.71s]  Jerma's average size dong.
[14530.38s -> 14532.22s]  Five community subs.
[14532.86s -> 14533.34s]  Five?
[14535.82s -> 14537.58s]  It was too funny.
[14541.32s -> 14542.20s]  Five.
[14542.20s -> 14542.68s]  Five.
[14543.48s -> 14544.52s]  What's happening?
[14544.52s -> 14546.12s]  Chase and extinguish the fuse?
[14546.68s -> 14549.32s]  Thank you for the 20 community subs.
[14549.32s -> 14550.20s]  I really appreciate it.
[14551.08s -> 14552.42s]  Where's the fuse?
[14553.62s -> 14555.46s]  That just fucking scared the shit out of me.
[14562.65s -> 14563.69s]  But thank you.
[14563.69s -> 14565.37s]  For the 20 community subs.
[14568.01s -> 14568.57s]  Nugget?
[14568.57s -> 14568.97s]  Somewhere.
[14569.61s -> 14572.57s]  It's right there.
[14572.57s -> 14572.81s]  Okay.
[14573.53s -> 14575.42s]  Can I get up?
[14596.70s -> 14597.90s]  He's shooting the fuse.
[14597.90s -> 14609.82s]  I was trying to extinguish.
[14609.82s -> 14610.71s]  What?
[14610.71s -> 14611.11s]  Tell us!
[14611.83s -> 14612.23s]  Tell us!
[14613.54s -> 14614.02s]  Okay.
[14614.02s -> 14614.58s]  Thank you.
[14614.58s -> 14615.94s]  Of course, I was successful,
[14615.94s -> 14618.82s]  or clearly I wouldn't be talking to you folks here today.
[14618.82s -> 14621.56s]  Naturally, I removed the last-
[14621.56s -> 14630.34s]  It was a touchy reunion.
[14630.34s -> 14630.66s]  What?
[14631.22s -> 14635.14s]  Did somebody just cut off my story?
[14635.70s -> 14637.77s]  Did somebody come into the bar
[14637.77s -> 14639.05s]  and grab a glass and sit down
[14639.05s -> 14640.17s]  and start telling their side?
[14640.81s -> 14644.22s]  This time, I was thoroughly exhausted
[14644.22s -> 14645.42s]  and dragging my ass
[14645.42s -> 14648.50s]  as I was not a young man anymore.
[14648.50s -> 14650.10s]  I walked off accidentally.
[14650.10s -> 14651.14s]  I didn't press space.
[14651.14s -> 14652.58s]  Thank God the game knows I'm stupid.
[14665.78s -> 14666.50s]  Ah, that's right.
[14666.50s -> 14667.38s]  I forgot the nugget.
[14667.38s -> 14667.78s]  Oh, well.
[14668.34s -> 14668.82s]  It's okay.
[14670.46s -> 14671.02s]  It's all right.
[14671.02s -> 14673.16s]  Kill that idiot!
[14673.24s -> 14682.50s]  Or more precisely, they found me.
[14682.50s -> 14682.90s]  Oh, right.
[14692.81s -> 14694.65s]  My body was just moving around
[14694.65s -> 14696.01s]  in such weird directions.
[14699.48s -> 14699.72s]  All right.
[14699.72s -> 14700.76s]  Let me just chill for a sec.
[14706.18s -> 14706.42s]  What?
[14707.14s -> 14709.48s]  Why do those guys die?
[14710.12s -> 14721.93s]  He's not going for the 100% run.
[14721.93s -> 14723.85s]  No, I'm not going for the 100%.
[14723.85s -> 14725.53s]  Just when I thought things couldn't get worse.
[14725.53s -> 14726.41s]  I'm going for any percent.
[14726.41s -> 14727.45s]  When Kid Curry opened up,
[14727.45s -> 14731.67s]  it was hidden in this tunnel
[14731.67s -> 14732.95s]  and pretty well shielded.
[14736.82s -> 14737.06s]  Oh.
[14737.70s -> 14742.25s]  There's Kid Curry.
[14742.25s -> 14752.01s]  Well, he has a great line of sight.
[14767.16s -> 14767.72s]  Jeez.
[14767.72s -> 14768.04s]  All right.
[14768.04s -> 14768.52s]  There he is.
[14769.16s -> 14778.14s]  I'm trying to shoot through the hole.
[14778.94s -> 14779.82s]  I don't think that's going to work.
[14780.46s -> 14794.26s]  It's going to have to get close.
[14797.24s -> 14798.04s]  Shoot.
[14798.04s -> 14801.24s]  Right down there.
[14808.92s -> 14809.48s]  Dynamite.
[14813.18s -> 14813.90s]  There's apparently a...
[14814.46s -> 14816.06s]  There's a nugget somewhere over here.
[14816.06s -> 14816.78s]  Probably in the wagon.
[14825.67s -> 14826.87s]  Is that far enough?
[14826.87s -> 14828.71s]  That's not far enough.
[14828.71s -> 14829.11s]  I got to go...
[14829.11s -> 14829.91s]  I got to run in,
[14829.91s -> 14831.19s]  throw the ball and then run back.
[14831.75s -> 14839.30s]  That's all the damage that did.
[14839.30s -> 14844.89s]  It hurts.
[14851.54s -> 14869.98s]  Oh, no, no, no, no!
[14869.98s -> 14870.78s]  What?
[14870.78s -> 14873.11s]  I...
[14879.02s -> 14880.06s]  Is this guy real?
[14880.06s -> 14882.14s]  Oh, I'm so upset by that one.
[14882.14s -> 14884.20s]  Fuck you.
[14884.76s -> 14885.40s]  Get out of here.
[14908.14s -> 14914.82s]  Why would you set him up running straight at me?
[14914.82s -> 14915.62s]  Whoa, he fucking...
[14915.62s -> 14916.50s]  Jesus.
[14916.50s -> 14916.74s]  What?
[14918.47s -> 14919.27s]  Where'd he go?
[14919.27s -> 14920.23s]  What the fuck is it?
[14923.77s -> 14924.97s]  My fucking God.
[14928.07s -> 14929.11s]  Oh, come on.
[14929.11s -> 14929.43s]  Whatever.
[14929.43s -> 14929.67s]  I know.
[14957.00s -> 14958.60s]  Here comes the guy.
[14958.60s -> 14960.12s]  He's going to sprint over here.
[14960.12s -> 14966.86s]  Oh, God.
[14966.86s -> 14972.95s]  That's not good.
[14972.95s -> 14974.07s]  Is he still alive?
[14974.07s -> 14979.70s]  He's not still alive, right?
[14979.70s -> 14980.34s]  Okay.
[14980.34s -> 14981.00s]  Here we go.
[14996.89s -> 14997.39s]  Got him.
[14998.09s -> 15001.18s]  That's when I met Kid Curry himself.
[15001.18s -> 15001.66s]  Let's go.
[15001.66s -> 15001.98s]  Duel.
[15001.98s -> 15005.58s]  He decided to stop pussyfooting around and deal with me personally.
[15007.35s -> 15008.55s]  This is gonna hurt.
[15008.55s -> 15018.63s]  Get that speed up.
[15019.27s -> 15031.61s]  This guy's dead.
[15040.26s -> 15040.90s]  Shit.
[15040.90s -> 15064.34s]  Because he was.
[15065.22s -> 15067.30s]  I was just a bit faster.
[15070.52s -> 15075.16s]  And as he lay wounded, I demanded to know the whereabouts of Roscoe Bob Bryant.
[15076.06s -> 15077.50s]  He shouted at me.
[15077.50s -> 15078.30s]  He pointed the gun at me.
[15078.30s -> 15079.34s]  You know what this is about?
[15080.82s -> 15084.30s]  Bob went with Butch in Sundance in South America.
[15084.30s -> 15086.14s]  You ain't never finding him.
[15093.10s -> 15096.22s]  Good thing I was paying attention and not looking at chat.
[15098.06s -> 15099.50s]  Imagine letting that guy shoot you.
[15101.02s -> 15102.94s]  East down south.
[15102.94s -> 15103.82s]  You bastard.
[15105.43s -> 15106.63s]  You'll never find him.
[15107.64s -> 15108.44s]  Thanks for the info.
[15109.43s -> 15109.99s]  Headshot.
[15120.15s -> 15120.95s]  71 percent.
[15125.05s -> 15132.57s]  So, in South America.
[15132.57s -> 15135.05s]  Yeah, you kinda glossed over that one.
[15135.05s -> 15136.73s]  Well, I found Jim.
[15136.73s -> 15139.27s]  Not long after my showdown with Ringo.
[15139.27s -> 15142.63s]  At the time, he was riding with the James Younger gang.
[15142.63s -> 15145.69s]  This guy has a lot of stories.
[15145.69s -> 15154.63s]  Don't you have to think about stuff like this?
[15156.47s -> 15158.87s]  My life is not even 1 percent as interesting as this guy's.
[15164.82s -> 15168.90s]  The coolest story I have is one time I got two double cheeseburgers when I ordered one.
[15176.76s -> 15182.79s]  I'll tell you a story about the extra couple nuggets I got.
[15182.79s -> 15184.39s]  They just put like more fries in the bag.
[15206.28s -> 15208.44s]  Meanwhile, they forget my fries four times.
[15209.24s -> 15212.71s]  This is the new gun.
[15213.67s -> 15217.56s]  I didn't hit the guy right here.
[15220.60s -> 15221.32s]  This is the new one.
[15221.32s -> 15222.36s]  Yeah, engraved ranger.
[15226.50s -> 15227.54s]  Another train mission.
[15228.34s -> 15235.64s]  Oh god.
[15240.25s -> 15242.73s]  I just crouched and I took the shotgun right in the face.
[15249.16s -> 15250.92s]  Trying to duck from a shotgun.
[15250.92s -> 15251.72s]  That's not gonna happen.
[15252.68s -> 15263.37s]  I'm gonna get like 20 points here.
[15264.17s -> 15266.92s]  See if I can get it.
[15267.56s -> 15276.66s]  Damn it.
[15276.66s -> 15278.58s]  It's hard to string it together in these missions.
[15281.34s -> 15282.30s]  Jesse James.
[15291.24s -> 15296.73s]  There we go.
[15296.73s -> 15307.56s]  Legend was he could stop a train with his bare hands by staring it down.
[15307.56s -> 15308.28s]  Jesse James.
[15318.62s -> 15330.39s]  They're behind me?
[15331.59s -> 15335.35s]  Decimated after that little fiasco they had in Northfield, Minnesota.
[15336.23s -> 15341.54s]  So Jesse needed more men and took on the killer I was after along with a host of others.
[15341.54s -> 15342.10s]  I almost forgot.
[15342.98s -> 15343.86s]  Okay, this is done.
[15344.90s -> 15345.94s]  I can lead into here.
[15347.08s -> 15348.76s]  Improve damage and concentration.
[15348.76s -> 15351.48s]  Just focus to do even more damage.
[15351.48s -> 15352.92s]  All you bullet shot and concentration.
[15353.96s -> 15358.12s]  Yeah, but 50% more of the headshot is they're dead.
[15358.84s -> 15359.80s]  They already were dead.
[15360.68s -> 15361.72s]  All they do are headshots.
[15362.28s -> 15364.31s]  But it doesn't really matter.
[15366.66s -> 15368.10s]  More concentration in the bar.
[15368.10s -> 15368.90s]  That's actually good.
[15369.62s -> 15373.40s]  And then dynamite looting.
[15374.95s -> 15378.15s]  Nah, the explosive stuff really not really doing for me.
[15381.91s -> 15383.43s]  Extra damage on combos.
[15384.41s -> 15385.45s]  Yeah, let's go up this way.
[15394.41s -> 15395.13s]  Nugget somewhere.
[15409.19s -> 15411.59s]  No, they were the most famous outlaw gang ever.
[15411.59s -> 15414.31s]  And you took them all on by your lonesome.
[15414.31s -> 15418.31s]  Again, I'm finding this all a little hard to swallow.
[15419.51s -> 15422.15s]  Maybe you need to wash it down with some whiskey.
[15422.15s -> 15427.51s]  By the way, did I mention that that train was destroyed?
[15427.51s -> 15428.23s]  Come on, more.
[15430.81s -> 15431.13s]  Damn it.
[15441.13s -> 15441.77s]  Air burst.
[15448.52s -> 15449.40s]  Nugget.
[15449.40s -> 15453.06s]  Oh, God.
[15453.62s -> 15459.86s]  I thought I heard the nugget sound.
[15473.70s -> 15474.66s]  Am I going to go take a piss?
[15474.66s -> 15477.94s]  Certainly I have an urgent need to drain my one-eyed snake.
[15477.94s -> 15482.74s]  Well, I've had a few drinks and I've been sitting here for quite a spell.
[15485.38s -> 15486.58s]  Right through there.
[15486.58s -> 15487.30s]  Let me show you.
[15487.86s -> 15488.34s]  Again.
[15489.46s -> 15494.33s]  See, he pees just as much as I do.
[15494.33s -> 15497.03s]  I've never heard so much malarkey in my life.
[15497.03s -> 15499.35s]  You think he's bullshit enough?
[15499.35s -> 15501.27s]  You don't think he's Silas Greaves?
[15501.27s -> 15504.07s]  I think he's just some old drunk looking for some free liquor.
[15505.58s -> 15505.82s]  Up?
[15506.62s -> 15511.26s]  There are no enemies.
[15512.06s -> 15515.29s]  I have to tell the story so enemies can show up.
[15515.29s -> 15516.33s]  I'm just in a giant loop.
[15516.33s -> 15519.94s]  I think I met Jesse James.
[15519.94s -> 15521.54s]  Boy, you got to be kidding me.
[15521.54s -> 15523.46s]  That story makes no sense at all.
[15523.46s -> 15527.54s]  I mean, you got to be too brick short of a load to believe that story.
[15527.54s -> 15528.74s]  I don't agree.
[15528.74s -> 15530.02s]  Jack, lay off the ball.
[15530.02s -> 15534.87s]  You seriously think that tired old man went with Jesse James?
[15535.91s -> 15537.21s]  I have to break the cycle?
[15537.93s -> 15548.73s]  It was a rickety ride and quite precarious.
[15559.19s -> 15559.83s]  That worked.
[15564.62s -> 15565.50s]  I got a wisdom.
[15565.50s -> 15566.70s]  I have to pee line.
[15566.70s -> 15575.91s]  Heard so much malarkey in my life.
[15575.91s -> 15579.21s]  You think he's bullshit enough?
[15579.29s -> 15581.21s]  You don't think he's Silas Greaves?
[15581.21s -> 15584.01s]  I think he's just some old drunk looking for some free liquor.
[15587.96s -> 15590.52s]  But where is this story coming from?
[15598.25s -> 15599.53s]  I'm not telling this portion.
[15604.12s -> 15605.96s]  You don't think you met Jesse James?
[15605.96s -> 15607.56s]  Boy, you got to be kidding me.
[15607.56s -> 15609.00s]  That story makes no sense at all.
[15609.72s -> 15613.48s]  You got to be too brick short of a load to believe that cock and bull story.
[15613.48s -> 15614.20s]  I don't agree.
[15614.76s -> 15616.04s]  Jack, lay off the ball.
[15616.04s -> 15620.84s]  You seriously think that tired old man went toe to toe with Jesse James?
[15621.64s -> 15623.16s]  Well, that's better.
[15623.16s -> 15623.72s]  What?
[15623.72s -> 15627.64s]  Did I mention that this Jim was married to the infamous Bell Star?
[15627.64s -> 15630.36s]  Of course, I didn't learn that until anyway.
[15631.08s -> 15632.68s]  That went really, really fast.
[15636.50s -> 15637.70s]  He didn't even have a chance to come back.
[15637.70s -> 15639.22s]  He didn't pull his pants up.
[15639.22s -> 15642.82s]  He's sitting here with his pants around his ankles.
[15648.82s -> 15650.42s]  Hope I don't have to do the whole thing again.
[15650.42s -> 15650.90s]  Thank God.
[15654.86s -> 15661.42s]  It was definitely safer on the inside of the train.
[15661.42s -> 15662.38s]  I am on the...
[15662.38s -> 15663.10s]  I don't understand.
[15667.90s -> 15669.34s]  That wasn't the inside of the train?
[15670.62s -> 15671.42s]  Did I fall off?
[15671.42s -> 15672.70s]  I don't think that's weird.
[15680.34s -> 15681.46s]  I just got shot right in the face.
[15703.80s -> 15706.97s]  He's doing so many animations that I couldn't shoot him.
[15713.80s -> 15715.24s]  Can't believe what just happened.
[15715.88s -> 15722.94s]  I didn't even get outplayed.
[15724.36s -> 15725.48s]  Outplayed?
[15725.48s -> 15727.72s]  No, I think he shot me off the train.
[15728.44s -> 15732.78s]  Where the fuck am I right now?
[15742.34s -> 15743.14s]  What is happening?
[15750.41s -> 15751.21s]  Didn't have to go.
[15751.85s -> 15759.46s]  It wasn't like this before.
[15760.18s -> 15761.91s]  Was it?
[15761.91s -> 15762.79s]  Did this happen?
[15765.50s -> 15766.22s]  What did it just...
[15766.22s -> 15766.94s]  What did it put me?
[15766.94s -> 15768.14s]  This is not where the...
[15768.14s -> 15768.64s]  Okay.
[15770.87s -> 15771.75s]  Why did it put me there?
[15772.31s -> 15773.69s]  Did it like skip me ahead?
[15774.41s -> 15790.09s]  Yeah, it put me ahead.
[15797.00s -> 15797.64s]  That was weird.
[15798.20s -> 15801.35s]  It just like sat...
[15801.35s -> 15802.55s]  Hey, go this way.
[15802.55s -> 15803.75s]  Remember how you died twice?
[15817.22s -> 15819.14s]  Can you get like the mud off your face?
[15819.14s -> 15827.11s]  What the fuck is going on?
[15839.93s -> 15841.61s]  Where's this Gatling?
[15841.61s -> 15844.65s]  I was attacked by some asshole on a Gatling gun.
[15844.65s -> 15845.37s]  Another one of these.
[15849.51s -> 15850.15s]  Where's this nugget?
[15851.91s -> 15852.63s]  Can I climb up?
[15852.63s -> 15853.27s]  Yes, I did.
[15853.83s -> 15856.01s]  I took it out.
[15856.01s -> 15857.37s]  I don't think I can get that.
[15857.37s -> 15858.17s]  We're dynamite.
[15858.17s -> 15863.32s]  Does it really matter, Jack?
[15863.32s -> 15865.62s]  You're messing with the flow of the story here.
[15872.55s -> 15880.92s]  Got it.
[15880.92s -> 15881.80s]  Oh, Jesus.
[15882.68s -> 15892.78s]  I'm just gonna stay down.
[15893.42s -> 15902.38s]  That didn't hit him?
[15903.10s -> 15904.15s]  That looked like it hit him.
[15920.54s -> 15920.78s]  What?
[15922.23s -> 15922.95s]  Wasn't he done...
[15922.95s -> 15923.75s]  He was done shooting.
[15924.39s -> 15925.59s]  He was in the middle of...
[15929.53s -> 15930.17s]  What the fuck?
[15938.22s -> 15939.18s]  He was done shooting.
[15939.74s -> 15941.99s]  I just instantly died.
[15942.63s -> 15961.40s]  All right, you can stop any second now.
[15961.40s -> 15971.43s]  I'm gonna get up to there.
[15971.99s -> 15994.02s]  That was a lot.
[16000.10s -> 16001.22s]  No, I'm just gonna do it this way.
[16006.41s -> 16006.81s]  He's dead.
[16034.41s -> 16035.21s]  What the fuck?
[16036.25s -> 16036.49s]  Oh!
[16036.49s -> 16037.37s]  D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d!
[16039.64s -> 16040.20s]  I'm gonna...
[16042.20s -> 16043.16s]  Okay, move now.
[16043.16s -> 16043.88s]  D-d-d-d-d-d!
[16053.30s -> 16054.02s]  Will you fu...
[16054.02s -> 16055.14s]  Just stop shooting!
[16085.72s -> 16087.32s]  Why did that do so little damage?
[16087.88s -> 16089.54s]  I was gonna shoot him in the fucking head.
[16107.32s -> 16107.96s]  Dumbest thing.
[16108.52s -> 16116.07s]  Now it's my turn.
[16116.71s -> 16118.23s]  This is...
[16118.23s -> 16121.75s]  These are just like meat boy replays of me coming at that guy.
[16122.31s -> 16139.42s]  Remember when I did that?
[16139.42s -> 16140.30s]  Oh, that was crazy.
[16140.86s -> 16147.82s]  This is a hard level.
[16148.38s -> 16159.21s]  Is that it?
[16159.21s -> 16159.77s]  Oh, I got...
[16168.97s -> 16169.29s]  Jim!
[16170.01s -> 16170.33s]  Jim!
[16171.21s -> 16172.09s]  Jim, you on the train?
[16174.18s -> 16174.58s]  Jim!
[16175.54s -> 16184.90s]  This happened already.
[16185.70s -> 16188.01s]  Didn't we do this already?
[16188.81s -> 16192.65s]  The same exact scenario with the armored shotgun guy behind the veil...
[16193.77s -> 16194.41s]  And the nugget.
[16195.37s -> 16196.15s]  Uh...
[16197.38s -> 16197.94s]  Right?
[16197.94s -> 16198.82s]  This happened already.
[16199.38s -> 16215.59s]  Am I supposed to be doing something here?
[16217.18s -> 16217.42s]  What?
[16217.42s -> 16217.90s]  Wait.
[16217.90s -> 16219.18s]  It just took all my juice.
[16220.14s -> 16223.45s]  Jesse James!
[16223.45s -> 16223.85s]  Again?
[16224.97s -> 16225.61s]  Oh, right.
[16225.61s -> 16227.29s]  We rewound and did the whole thing again.
[16227.29s -> 16227.69s]  Actually, I...
[16227.69s -> 16228.17s]  Okay, okay.
[16228.17s -> 16228.73s]  Right, right, right.
[16250.04s -> 16251.00s]  Do I walk over here?
[16251.56s -> 16252.52s]  I have to walk through this?
[16254.41s -> 16254.81s]  No.
[16254.81s -> 16256.25s]  I almost just walked and died.
[16256.25s -> 16256.49s]  Good.
[16256.97s -> 16259.05s]  You had a showdown with Jesse James?
[16259.05s -> 16260.73s]  Of course he didn't.
[16260.73s -> 16263.93s]  Everybody knows that Jesse was killed by Bob Ford.
[16263.93s -> 16264.17s]  Yeah.
[16264.81s -> 16267.45s]  Jesse went out like John Wesley Harden,
[16267.45s -> 16269.37s]  but shot him in the back of the head.
[16269.93s -> 16272.89s]  Yes, it doesn't matter how far you run, does it, man?
[16272.89s -> 16275.67s]  Ast always catches up with you.
[16276.31s -> 16280.20s]  This shit's moving around all over the place.
[16285.43s -> 16286.55s]  Holy shit, you are awful.
[16286.55s -> 16288.46s]  Yeah, I killed Jesse James.
[16288.46s -> 16291.90s]  Just wounded him bad enough to convince him to hang up his guns.
[16291.90s -> 16293.58s]  What about that Jim fella?
[16293.58s -> 16294.38s]  What happened to him?
[16294.70s -> 16297.42s]  I figure he was up front with a gun in the engineer's head.
[16297.42s -> 16298.46s]  He was terrible.
[16299.02s -> 16300.86s]  That bastard slipped away again.
[16301.50s -> 16305.02s]  I'll tell you how I got him, but first I need to wet my whistle.
[16306.58s -> 16307.06s]  Not bad.
[16307.62s -> 16317.59s]  Then I was gonna come up here to more concentration bar
[16319.46s -> 16321.48s]  and then leading to extra damage.
[16324.62s -> 16325.10s]  Very cool.
[16337.02s -> 16339.18s]  How are the people here that never heard the phrase wet my whistle?
[16342.79s -> 16343.67s]  You never heard that before?
[16344.23s -> 16348.26s]  After my showdown with Jesse,
[16348.34s -> 16350.34s]  I continued to track his been around forever.
[16350.34s -> 16352.10s]  Frank and that son of a bitch Jim.
[16355.45s -> 16358.09s]  Get through the hostile territory and find Jim.
[16358.09s -> 16360.17s]  ...into the high mountains as they were going to ground.
[16360.17s -> 16364.41s]  Ozarks, I believe.
[16364.41s -> 16365.93s]  Just like broke all my bones.
[16365.93s -> 16368.25s]  Perfect place to hide out from the authorities.
[16368.25s -> 16373.42s]  What was that little ding there?
[16373.42s -> 16374.38s]  What was that little ding?
[16378.62s -> 16381.02s]  In fact, before I could find them,
[16381.02s -> 16385.69s]  some Indians who fled the race and were hiding the terrorists found me first.
[16385.69s -> 16387.91s]  They probably thought I was a cat scout
[16387.91s -> 16391.19s]  and didn't want me telling the military where they were.
[16392.15s -> 16394.71s]  They could have been Cheyenne, but...
[16394.71s -> 16396.71s]  I think we've already replayed this mission.
[16398.15s -> 16400.07s]  He's told the story so strangely so many times.
[16401.35s -> 16402.95s]  I remember this exact location.
[16403.83s -> 16409.43s]  Remember this?
[16409.99s -> 16412.87s]  Like I fell, but it was a good advantage.
[16413.51s -> 16433.67s]  I want to get a combo here.
[16437.22s -> 16438.74s]  No, no, no.
[16440.02s -> 16440.98s]  Don't slow it down.
[16441.78s -> 16445.94s]  I want it to go fast.
[16445.94s -> 16448.36s]  Now where were the Indians?
[16448.36s -> 16453.61s]  Do you like that time?
[16453.61s -> 16454.25s]  I don't.
[16454.25s -> 16455.93s]  Did I tell you about Grey Wolf?
[16455.93s -> 16456.65s]  Yes, sir.
[16456.65s -> 16457.77s]  You did.
[16457.77s -> 16458.33s]  Yeah, see?
[16459.45s -> 16460.17s]  I remember this.
[16469.88s -> 16470.68s]  Okay.
[16470.68s -> 16471.24s]  All right.
[16471.24s -> 16472.20s]  Somebody replay it.
[16472.20s -> 16474.84s]  Somebody replay that whole thing on the clip and look at it and slow it down.
[16475.80s -> 16477.66s]  Feel like I like fucking three times.
[16477.66s -> 16478.14s]  Play it again.
[16503.46s -> 16504.58s]  What's going on right now?
[16504.58s -> 16504.98s]  Why are we...
[16511.51s -> 16512.95s]  This guy's just running around.
[16513.59s -> 16514.39s]  No, hurry, hurry.
[16514.39s -> 16515.43s]  Come on.
[16515.43s -> 16521.62s]  I need ammo.
[16522.18s -> 16524.86s]  Yes.
[16524.86s -> 16527.45s]  Mr. Graves, are you all right?
[16527.45s -> 16527.95s]  Nice.
[16536.12s -> 16537.24s]  Pretty good voice, actually.
[16543.91s -> 16551.29s]  Won't you spare me your ears?
[16551.29s -> 16556.65s]  That I can't see with eyes cold hands.
[16557.61s -> 16562.86s]  They can hold me where I am.
[16562.86s -> 16568.46s]  None can excel the door.
[16568.46s -> 16576.10s]  We stand unshaken.
[16576.10s -> 16578.26s]  Oh, oh, oh, dead.
[16578.26s -> 16578.82s]  Oh, no.
[16578.82s -> 16583.56s]  Won't you spare me your ears?
[16583.56s -> 16587.08s]  And I stand unshaken.
[16593.78s -> 16594.50s]  I didn't ruin it.
[16594.50s -> 16594.98s]  He was done.
[16603.48s -> 16616.10s]  Could you wait to call me?
[16616.10s -> 16618.58s]  Uh, do I have to dodge these?
[16618.58s -> 16625.14s]  Won't you spare me your ears?
[16627.96s -> 16630.28s]  So are you going to answer the question?
[16630.28s -> 16631.72s]  What question is that?
[16631.72s -> 16632.60s]  Jim Reed.
[16633.32s -> 16634.28s]  Did you ever find it?
[16634.84s -> 16639.61s]  Reed was indeed that song that you certainly heard.
[16639.61s -> 16641.45s]  That's right, man.
[16641.45s -> 16643.96s]  A despicable character.
[16643.96s -> 16648.87s]  I remember him laughing at me and my brothers.
[16649.91s -> 16652.95s]  He was intent on avoiding my vengeance,
[16652.95s -> 16654.63s]  but nothing was going to stop me.
[16656.06s -> 16656.56s]  Nothing.
[16660.82s -> 16661.70s]  Now, here we are.
[16662.58s -> 16665.48s]  That's Frank James.
[16666.12s -> 16667.86s]  Frank James.
[16667.86s -> 16675.85s]  Get to the hilltop and avoid the sniper's bullets.
[16680.31s -> 16681.51s]  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16681.51s -> 16684.31s]  I need, this is extra damage during combos.
[16688.12s -> 16689.80s]  After fourth level combo,
[16689.80s -> 16691.80s]  your bullets will do a hundred percent more damage.
[16692.52s -> 16693.40s]  That actually kind of sucks.
[16694.04s -> 16705.91s]  I'm going to go with some of these.
[16706.47s -> 16708.34s]  These are all based on the shotgun.
[16708.34s -> 16708.90s]  Come closer.
[16708.90s -> 16710.50s]  More concentration for full blast.
[16710.50s -> 16711.46s]  Yeah, it's all shotgun.
[16720.07s -> 16721.03s]  Yeah, I guess we'll get it.
[16721.59s -> 16724.23s]  I'll end up with the quick shooter.
[16724.79s -> 16728.70s]  We'll go down here.
[16731.37s -> 16731.93s]  Frank James.
[16735.14s -> 16742.31s]  Jesus, don't give me a second, man.
[16742.31s -> 16742.81s]  Come on.
[16750.38s -> 16751.26s]  Whoa, where is he?
[16759.46s -> 16765.03s]  Um, I have the reaction time of a pineapple.
[16765.03s -> 16766.71s]  I was just looking at the menu.
[16769.35s -> 16771.59s]  I'm in the menu doing points
[16771.59s -> 16773.91s]  and I come out and die in a tenth of a second.
[16773.91s -> 16775.75s]  That's pineapple reactions?
[16776.63s -> 16785.91s]  Why did it not go through?
[16785.91s -> 16795.94s]  He's up there.
[16795.94s -> 16798.18s]  Um, if we go this way.
[16798.18s -> 16811.21s]  That doesn't even make any sense.
[16811.85s -> 16813.26s]  I shouldn't even laugh at that
[16813.26s -> 16815.42s]  so I don't enable that kind of behavior in chat.
[16816.14s -> 16820.18s]  I shouldn't even be laughing.
[16822.66s -> 16823.46s]  I should be, I should go.
[16825.66s -> 16826.78s]  Time that guy out quick.
[16826.78s -> 16827.28s]  Okay.
[16827.66s -> 16828.89s]  That's what I should have done.
[16829.53s -> 16835.69s]  I'm guessing Frank James believed I was responsible
[16835.69s -> 16837.69s]  for the demise of his brother, Jesse.
[16837.69s -> 16839.45s]  I couldn't really disagree with the man
[16839.45s -> 16841.61s]  as I thought Jesse was dead then as well.
[16844.54s -> 16845.58s]  Make your, what's it say?
[16845.58s -> 16846.62s]  Make your what?
[16846.62s -> 16847.74s]  Make your what?
[16847.74s -> 16848.62s]  It could be anything.
[16848.62s -> 16849.50s]  Make your bed.
[16850.38s -> 16851.26s]  Make your taxes.
[16852.22s -> 16853.26s]  Make your gun shoot.
[16853.26s -> 16853.90s]  What does it say?
[16853.90s -> 16854.54s]  Make your what?
[16857.03s -> 16858.15s]  It could have been anything.
[16858.79s -> 16863.77s]  But he's not there.
[16863.77s -> 16865.88s]  But he was still intent on-
[16865.88s -> 16866.60s]  Secret.
[16866.60s -> 16872.12s]  Pushed in on him again.
[16872.12s -> 16874.04s]  He backed up-
[16874.04s -> 16874.60s]  Told ya.
[16874.60s -> 16875.48s]  Confirmed your angle on me.
[16875.48s -> 16880.15s]  Is it a shotgun?
[16881.45s -> 16882.25s]  Uh, I'll take that.
[16883.13s -> 16893.77s]  Oh fuck, he's shooting again.
[16893.77s -> 16894.81s]  Oh my god, I don't know where he is.
[16895.45s -> 16898.57s]  What direction is he shooting from?
[16899.21s -> 16905.69s]  Alright, straight ahead.
[16908.15s -> 16909.27s]  Oh my god, he's right there.
[16909.27s -> 16910.07s]  Fuck, I just saw him.
[16910.07s -> 16910.57s]  Okay.
[16911.03s -> 16914.34s]  He's right there.
[16914.90s -> 16928.89s]  And fault Frank for wanting his revenges.
[16928.89s -> 16930.97s]  I was there for the same damn reason myself.
[16930.97s -> 16931.53s]  I don't know where to go.
[16931.53s -> 16933.13s]  At this point, I'm guessing you think
[16933.21s -> 16935.29s]  Silas Greaves is the worst murderer
[16935.29s -> 16937.05s]  than Jim Reid ever was.
[16937.05s -> 16938.10s]  No, sir.
[16938.10s -> 16939.94s]  A man who spent half his life
[16939.94s -> 16941.94s]  killing somebody's brothers,
[16941.94s -> 16943.94s]  fathers, sons.
[16943.94s -> 16946.34s]  I think you were just looking for justice, sir.
[16946.34s -> 16948.50s]  Is that what I was talking about in your life?
[16948.50s -> 16950.86s]  Is that what it was?
[16950.86s -> 16951.42s]  Justice.
[16952.14s -> 16953.14s]  I think he's right-
[16953.94s -> 16954.71s]  Is there-
[16954.71s -> 16955.11s]  I don't-
[16955.11s -> 16956.07s]  There's nothing I can hide behind.
[16956.07s -> 16956.79s]  This rock right here
[16956.79s -> 16957.75s]  is the only thing I can hide behind.
[16958.55s -> 16960.04s]  Do you see anything else?
[16962.42s -> 16963.06s]  Fuck.
[16963.06s -> 16963.62s]  Uh, is this-
[16965.67s -> 16966.17s]  What?
[16971.86s -> 16972.82s]  The sky is falling.
[16978.26s -> 16981.50s]  He hit me.
[16981.50s -> 16982.00s]  There he is.
[16990.28s -> 16990.78s]  These-
[17005.82s -> 17009.05s]  How?
[17012.06s -> 17012.86s]  Can he hit me from here?
[17023.74s -> 17024.46s]  Is that him?
[17031.11s -> 17032.23s]  Give me the dynamite.
[17033.82s -> 17035.66s]  That was throwing him off the cliff.
[17036.63s -> 17038.07s]  I was trying to aim, so-
[17038.63s -> 17039.51s]  Oh, whatever.
[17040.31s -> 17041.67s]  What a shitty hideout.
[17041.67s -> 17043.35s]  Fuck you for having such a bad hideout.
[17054.04s -> 17055.80s]  Yeah, go back to the three little pigs.
[17056.36s -> 17057.32s]  Your house sucks.
[17075.78s -> 17077.86s]  See, I grew wings and flew down there,
[17077.86s -> 17078.58s]  and now here he is.
[17098.38s -> 17098.88s]  Bastard.
[17104.22s -> 17105.34s]  Bullshit, is he gonna pull a gun?
[17105.34s -> 17106.38s]  We parted in peace,
[17106.38s -> 17108.62s]  as Frank pointed out the path to my prey
[17108.62s -> 17110.62s]  before making his way back down the hill.
[17123.46s -> 17123.96s]  That- that's-
[17124.74s -> 17126.42s]  He- I- I'm trying to preemptively.
[17126.42s -> 17127.46s]  He was gonna shoot me or something,
[17127.46s -> 17128.58s]  that's how it always happens.
[17129.38s -> 17133.70s]  Now he's stuck in a time paradox.
[17133.70s -> 17136.31s]  It's alright.
[17136.31s -> 17138.68s]  We'll get out of it together.
[17139.56s -> 17140.52s]  You and me.
[17140.52s -> 17141.16s]  Just you and me.
[17142.86s -> 17143.82s]  Yes, I'm talking to you.
[17144.78s -> 17145.98s]  There are a lot of people here,
[17145.98s -> 17147.50s]  but you're the one I'm talking to.
[17148.30s -> 17151.83s]  Forget about all these other people here,
[17151.83s -> 17152.33s]  you know?
[17179.56s -> 17180.20s]  Right in the leg.
[17199.64s -> 17200.14s]  Drama.
[17209.34s -> 17229.61s]  It was about that time, right?
[17229.61s -> 17230.25s]  Of course it was.
[17233.22s -> 17243.99s]  Fucked up the accuracy, but it's fine.
[17257.53s -> 17258.17s]  Shit.
[17258.17s -> 17258.65s]  Not good.
[17259.21s -> 17266.50s]  Can they shoot through this?
[17266.50s -> 17267.78s]  It's just wood, right?
[17267.78s -> 17272.52s]  No, I can too.
[17278.73s -> 17279.23s]  Ooh.
[17279.61s -> 17280.33s]  Ooh.
[17280.33s -> 17280.83s]  Whoa!
[17281.37s -> 17299.48s]  Ow, shit.
[17299.48s -> 17317.10s]  Come on, bring it on.
[17320.04s -> 17321.42s]  Here we go.
[17329.67s -> 17350.14s]  Lightning.
[17350.84s -> 17361.48s]  It's a lot easier to know you.
[17364.17s -> 17366.17s]  Oh well.
[17366.17s -> 17366.65s]  No points?
[17366.65s -> 17367.69s]  I got four to five secrets?
[17367.69s -> 17368.19s]  What?
[17385.50s -> 17387.54s]  Pineapple reaction.
[17387.54s -> 17389.54s]  He had pineapple reaction time.
[17394.14s -> 17395.42s]  Back to episode seven.
[17396.22s -> 17397.10s]  The wild bunch.
[17398.41s -> 17400.09s]  We're going back to the future again.
[17404.09s -> 17414.50s]  This is the worst mission in the game.
[17415.30s -> 17416.26s]  Oh well.
[17416.26s -> 17417.46s]  That's encouraging to hear.
[17420.95s -> 17421.45s]  We'll see.
[17422.07s -> 17427.03s]  The good, the bad, and the dead.
[17435.98s -> 17437.18s]  Have fun with this one.
[17438.94s -> 17439.98s]  He doesn't know.
[17446.31s -> 17452.36s]  How close am I to the last weapon that I want to unlock?
[17453.08s -> 17454.78s]  I'm pretty much there.
[17455.42s -> 17458.68s]  So then we'll get the ivory handled quick shooter.
[17460.10s -> 17461.78s]  More damage and faster aim speed.
[17462.58s -> 17463.96s]  I'm going to try it at least once.
[17464.76s -> 17475.35s]  Well, that's it.
[17475.35s -> 17476.16s]  There's no-
[17476.86s -> 17477.90s]  Why would it not get-
[17477.90s -> 17480.54s]  Usually you get to do like three or four of those.
[17480.54s -> 17482.46s]  I just get to quick time event the one guy?
[17484.17s -> 17484.67s]  All right.
[17485.69s -> 17488.25s]  Why is that guy doing a backflip?
[17514.42s -> 17514.92s]  Here we go.
[17515.70s -> 17517.02s]  There it is.
[17517.82s -> 17520.14s]  I've re-handled the quick shooter.
[17522.83s -> 17523.79s]  I can't wait to try him.
[17548.35s -> 17549.47s]  Bob Bryant.
[17560.08s -> 17561.92s]  Well, it's one way to do that.
[17566.17s -> 17566.67s]  Nugget.
[17576.73s -> 17577.37s]  Ooh, there it is.
[17577.37s -> 17577.87s]  Okay.
[17581.37s -> 17582.96s]  So these are the quick shooters.
[17586.27s -> 17587.07s]  Those are fast.
[17598.57s -> 17599.07s]  Very quick!
[17599.77s -> 17600.57s]  All right, nice.
[17600.57s -> 17601.07s]  I'll use them.
[17601.69s -> 17606.84s]  Let's head back down here.
[17607.56s -> 17610.72s]  And out the door.
[17610.72s -> 17615.63s]  No, I don't want any of those.
[17615.63s -> 17617.87s]  At this point in the game, why even have boxes like this?
[17619.13s -> 17621.21s]  I have upgraded better weapons.
[17621.93s -> 17623.21s]  Every version, essentially.
[17624.70s -> 17625.20s]  I gotta go-
[17630.35s -> 17631.39s]  Why does it want to go back up here?
[17632.11s -> 17655.23s]  Uh, hang over here?
[17669.47s -> 17669.97s]  Okay.
[17674.84s -> 17675.40s]  The stair-
[17675.40s -> 17676.44s]  The stairs going up?
[17676.44s -> 17679.80s]  Yeah, I mean it wanted me to go in that building and go up here.
[17679.80s -> 17682.12s]  But where the fuck was I supposed to go up to this?
[17684.99s -> 17686.03s]  Where are the stairs?
[17686.59s -> 17694.16s]  What the hell does it want me to do?
[17694.56s -> 17703.39s]  Is he actually blind?
[17703.39s -> 17703.89s]  No!
[17704.43s -> 17704.93s]  What?
[17705.39s -> 17715.15s]  I did it.
[17730.44s -> 17730.94s]  What?
[17730.94s -> 17731.44s]  Okay.
[17742.67s -> 17743.17s]  Secrets?
[17749.76s -> 17750.26s]  All right.
[17751.04s -> 17760.60s]  Again, just one guy.
[17760.60s -> 17769.05s]  All right, you in here?
[17769.05s -> 17785.08s]  What house are you in?
[17785.08s -> 17785.58s]  Fine.
[17785.58s -> 17787.16s]  Bush, Cassidy, and the Sundance Kid.
[17789.20s -> 17789.70s]  Yeah.
[17800.70s -> 17801.20s]  Okay.
[17809.32s -> 17816.13s]  Nugget?
[17820.51s -> 17821.01s]  Nugget?
[17824.99s -> 17825.95s]  What the fuck was that?
[17829.15s -> 17830.99s]  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[17830.99s -> 17831.87s]  I just want the-
[17831.87s -> 17832.37s]  There's the secret.
[17836.49s -> 17836.99s]  Now, every-
[17837.85s -> 17838.57s]  I'm just gonna get-
[17838.57s -> 17839.21s]  Collapse them.
[17839.85s -> 17847.08s]  Let's take the other guns.
[17847.80s -> 17849.56s]  I feel like this is going to be more useful.
[17850.20s -> 17866.59s]  Oh, he's up there.
[17869.36s -> 17870.00s]  Five points.
[17876.24s -> 17876.74s]  God.
[17887.02s -> 17887.52s]  Oh!
[17898.91s -> 17899.87s]  Oh, wait, I'm dead?
[17899.87s -> 17900.67s]  I'm supposed to be dead?
[17902.35s -> 17902.85s]  Totally.
[17918.11s -> 17919.23s]  Dead the whole time.
[17921.52s -> 17924.16s]  Find your way through ghost town.
[17928.12s -> 17929.24s]  Can I walk out here?
[17931.96s -> 17936.56s]  Nah, I don't want those.
[17937.28s -> 17946.68s]  Can't open the door?
[17962.36s -> 17962.86s]  Ghosts?
[17977.64s -> 17978.60s]  Um, so.
[17979.64s -> 17980.14s]  Hi.
[17981.05s -> 17984.57s]  Guy that just appeared on my screen and killed me instantly.
[17989.26s -> 17991.90s]  That old war horse had died two years before.
[17992.62s -> 17996.40s]  Maybe I was dead too and confronting the ghosts of my past.
[17996.96s -> 18001.76s]  Perhaps all my sins were coming back to haunt me and drag me down to perdition.
[18002.72s -> 18007.79s]  There's two Pat Garrett's.
[18017.28s -> 18018.16s]  Holy shit.
[18032.41s -> 18033.37s]  And where is he again?
[18033.93s -> 18034.97s]  He's throwing dynamite.
[18036.20s -> 18036.70s]  What?
[18037.16s -> 18040.66s]  I tried.
[18043.90s -> 18044.40s]  Jesus.
[18045.34s -> 18045.84s]  Hide.
[18049.66s -> 18050.78s]  You can't even see him.
[18051.50s -> 18059.04s]  I can barely see their ghost faces.
[18059.76s -> 18076.40s]  You need to have that concentration bar filled for this.
[18077.44s -> 18080.80s]  Oh, come on.
[18086.81s -> 18088.97s]  How many Henry Plumbers are there?
[18088.97s -> 18090.83s]  All right, just crouch.
[18091.47s -> 18097.14s]  Come on.
[18097.52s -> 18102.08s]  I'm going this way.
[18104.06s -> 18104.54s]  No, I'm not.
[18104.54s -> 18105.26s]  I can't go that way.
[18105.98s -> 18116.06s]  There he is.
[18120.86s -> 18121.36s]  Fuck!
[18121.66s -> 18122.16s]  Which way?
[18126.09s -> 18143.52s]  All right, nope.
[18143.52s -> 18144.32s]  That's not how you do it.
[18144.96s -> 18149.53s]  I thought maybe I could just run in there and just...
[18149.53s -> 18150.57s]  No, that's not gonna happen.
[18160.27s -> 18161.87s]  I gotta get cover somewhere here.
[18162.51s -> 18165.84s]  Watch out for the dynamite.
[18165.84s -> 18166.88s]  He's gonna throw dynamite at me.
[18167.52s -> 18172.40s]  All right, there's two down.
[18173.04s -> 18174.35s]  The other one's over here.
[18174.91s -> 18179.30s]  All right, that's it.
[18185.12s -> 18189.45s]  He's over here.
[18190.09s -> 18196.08s]  Ow!
[18196.38s -> 18205.26s]  I can see him a little bit.
[18206.06s -> 18216.04s]  Wait till I heal up.
[18216.04s -> 18217.56s]  All right, I'm good.
[18231.72s -> 18233.32s]  Any more people from your past?
[18233.32s -> 18235.32s]  Any more boss rush people to deal with?
[18235.32s -> 18243.85s]  I guess not.
[18243.85s -> 18244.73s]  Hold on.
[18244.73s -> 18248.67s]  There's a nugget here right there.
[18249.31s -> 18251.10s]  All right, got a wall.
[18251.66s -> 18258.67s]  Please tell me there's a checkpoint.
[18269.39s -> 18271.07s]  Holy shit, he really did appear.
[18273.26s -> 18274.46s]  God, he really did appear.
[18281.48s -> 18289.28s]  What's left?
[18290.16s -> 18290.88s]  Oh, God.
[18291.52s -> 18292.02s]  Okay.
[18305.44s -> 18305.94s]  Up there?
[18317.24s -> 18317.74s]  Fuck!
[18318.04s -> 18318.54s]  Fuck!
[18319.72s -> 18320.52s]  Up here still?
[18321.32s -> 18321.82s]  Over here.
[18324.10s -> 18324.98s]  Oh, God.
[18324.98s -> 18326.02s]  Tree, save me.
[18327.33s -> 18327.83s]  Jesus.
[18328.37s -> 18336.86s]  Where the fuck?
[18336.86s -> 18338.46s]  Oh, my goodness gracious.
[18348.78s -> 18349.50s]  All right, I gotta save.
[18351.54s -> 18367.84s]  All right, hide behind a tombstone or something.
[18369.34s -> 18370.62s]  I'm going away from the story.
[18370.62s -> 18371.12s]  How?
[18371.98s -> 18372.70s]  They're all down there.
[18374.48s -> 18374.98s]  Here we go.
[18380.59s -> 18381.09s]  Wow.
[18398.62s -> 18399.12s]  God!
[18405.97s -> 18407.01s]  God damn it!
[18407.01s -> 18407.89s]  He's still alive.
[18419.58s -> 18421.42s]  I gotta hide behind the house or something.
[18421.42s -> 18422.38s]  I can't go that way.
[18423.34s -> 18423.84s]  Fuck!
[18424.14s -> 18424.64s]  No!
[18435.18s -> 18435.90s]  Where are...
[18435.90s -> 18436.94s]  It's the last one!
[18446.43s -> 18448.11s]  You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[18449.07s -> 18464.66s]  I'm dead.
[18477.90s -> 18478.78s]  This is ins...
[18478.78s -> 18479.82s]  Oh, no.
[18479.82s -> 18480.32s]  I...
[18482.11s -> 18483.07s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[18489.74s -> 18492.14s]  And okay, here's another dumb thing.
[18493.81s -> 18498.05s]  If you walk too far, you restart the whole level.
[18498.69s -> 18502.46s]  How big is this area?
[18502.46s -> 18505.70s]  Oh, this sucks ass.
[18506.50s -> 18507.14s]  All right.
[18507.14s -> 18513.98s]  Well, how the fuck am I ever gonna beat this?
[18524.67s -> 18525.55s]  I'm not gonna use...
[18525.55s -> 18527.07s]  I'm gonna try to hold this.
[18527.07s -> 18531.92s]  I say that now.
[18531.92s -> 18533.92s]  They just spray a thousand bullets.
[18533.92s -> 18535.52s]  And look, I'm going too far up in the story.
[18535.52s -> 18536.64s]  Time to restart the level.
[18563.12s -> 18564.32s]  Fast shotgun reload.
[18564.32s -> 18565.36s]  No, what can help me here?
[18568.53s -> 18570.85s]  Faster revolver reload, maybe.
[18571.73s -> 18576.30s]  Probably the faster reload.
[18576.46s -> 18600.38s]  Somebody behind me too.
[18601.02s -> 18602.50s]  I have no idea.
[18603.14s -> 18603.46s]  They got...
[18603.46s -> 18603.78s]  The guys...
[18603.78s -> 18604.98s]  This guy is next to me.
[18606.22s -> 18607.74s]  Somehow this dude got next to me.
[18628.85s -> 18630.37s]  This gun's not good for this.
[18630.93s -> 18634.50s]  I think I gotta stay with the pistols.
[18635.14s -> 18637.28s]  This takes too long to kill anything.
[18637.28s -> 18638.08s]  Even with headshots.
[18643.26s -> 18643.98s]  They're all over here.
[18676.34s -> 18677.62s]  They're fucking everywhere!
[18687.92s -> 18688.64s]  My...
[18688.64s -> 18689.28s]  Come on!
[18707.84s -> 18708.08s]  What?
[18711.04s -> 18711.36s]  What?
[18716.16s -> 18717.28s]  Why do you have that much health?
[18718.32s -> 18719.36s]  Why do you have that much health?
[18719.92s -> 18721.31s]  I don't know what to do.
[18730.61s -> 18731.97s]  Oh my fucking god.
[18732.53s -> 18738.94s]  Where is he?
[18738.94s -> 18739.58s]  Which one?
[18739.58s -> 18740.22s]  Left or right?
[18752.54s -> 18754.46s]  Somebody said the Undertaker.
[18754.46s -> 18765.94s]  He just baited me so hard.
[18766.58s -> 18769.63s]  Holy fuck, man.
[18769.63s -> 18770.51s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[18790.30s -> 18791.18s]  No!
[18791.18s -> 18792.30s]  Tombstone save!
[18801.89s -> 18802.45s]  Don't do it.
[18808.05s -> 18809.33s]  Holy fuck, man.
[18813.31s -> 18813.95s]  No!
[18813.95s -> 18814.43s]  Which way?
[18847.41s -> 18848.13s]  Holy fuck.
[18848.13s -> 18849.49s]  Jesus Christ, that was insane.
[18849.49s -> 18857.02s]  That was fucking crazy.
[18857.02s -> 18858.06s]  I thought I did though.
[18858.06s -> 18859.26s]  I didn't think I was gonna beat that.
[18862.34s -> 18874.99s]  Butch Cassidy.
[18878.19s -> 18879.15s]  Sundance Kid.
[18880.83s -> 18882.67s]  The good, the bad, and the dead.
[18882.67s -> 18884.91s]  And Scylla's Grieves is...
[18884.91s -> 18890.51s]  But the kid wasn't quite deceased.
[18890.51s -> 18892.27s]  We gotta do a three-way duel?
[18892.27s -> 18900.58s]  Those two looked like they hadn't seen each other for quite a while.
[18900.58s -> 18902.62s]  Clearly they were no...
[18902.62s -> 18906.22s]  Thank god I had those improved guns.
[18908.22s -> 18909.98s]  I was hoping I wouldn't have to kill you.
[18909.98s -> 18917.79s]  I asked them about Bob Bryant.
[18917.79s -> 18920.91s]  But they were too busy with their own hated conversation.
[18921.55s -> 18925.44s]  Let me get this shit straight.
[18926.96s -> 18933.54s]  And the love of...
[18933.54s -> 18936.02s]  So is that tab party.
[18936.02s -> 18939.38s]  I didn't want to shoot anybody until I had an answer to my question.
[18940.02s -> 18942.42s]  But those boys didn't give me much of a choice.
[18943.14s -> 18943.78s]  Wait, what?
[18943.78s -> 18945.06s]  I'm gonna interfere in their game?
[18948.03s -> 18951.55s]  Use Q and E to switch your focus to the enemy who's looking at you.
[18954.03s -> 18954.91s]  Are you serious?
[18958.22s -> 18958.94s]  Wait, I have to...
[18958.94s -> 18960.22s]  Do I have to shoot them?
[18960.22s -> 18974.85s]  Who makes the move first move?
[19000.59s -> 19001.07s]  Damn.
[19001.07s -> 19011.14s]  All right, so he's looking at me now, right?
[19011.14s -> 19012.74s]  SCP Cassidy.
[19012.74s -> 19019.65s]  Whoops.
[19019.65s -> 19020.21s]  Bad speed.
[19020.21s -> 19021.41s]  This is gonna be fucking...
[19021.41s -> 19022.53s]  It's botched already.
[19022.53s -> 19025.15s]  Oh, this is looking all botched.
[19025.15s -> 19025.87s]  This is already...
[19026.43s -> 19027.71s]  I fucked this whole thing up.
[19027.71s -> 19028.19s]  I can't...
[19028.19s -> 19029.87s]  There's no way I'm gonna do this.
[19030.67s -> 19033.50s]  Is it gonna be a fucking Christmas miracle if this goes through?
[19034.61s -> 19035.41s]  8%!
[19036.13s -> 19047.86s]  Damn it.
[19047.86s -> 19051.89s]  Why was it my screen?
[19051.89s -> 19066.80s]  Look at me.
[19066.80s -> 19067.28s]  Look at me.
[19067.84s -> 19075.30s]  Look at me, please!
[19075.30s -> 19083.84s]  This is the one.
[19101.60s -> 19104.32s]  It was kind of anticlimactic, but it's all right.
[19110.74s -> 19111.62s]  I'll take it.
[19111.62s -> 19112.82s]  At least it's over 50%.
[19116.14s -> 19118.14s]  It is 50%, so I'm okay with that.
[19119.28s -> 19120.16s]  Never under 50.
[19120.80s -> 19139.95s]  At least no 49s, no 38s.
[19140.83s -> 19143.46s]  It's the finale.
[19151.66s -> 19152.70s]  But it ain't the truth.
[19153.58s -> 19155.98s]  So, you never found Bob?
[19155.98s -> 19157.58s]  There is no Bob.
[19157.58s -> 19160.30s]  This old sumbitch ain't even Silas Greaves.
[19161.98s -> 19163.50s]  Sir, is that true?
[19164.06s -> 19166.22s]  Have you been pulling our legs this whole time?
[19167.10s -> 19168.75s]  Not the whole time.
[19168.75s -> 19172.64s]  Man, I think you've worn out your welcome here.
[19172.64s -> 19173.76s]  Maybe you're right, Jack.
[19174.72s -> 19176.40s]  Maybe it's time to pay.
[19177.20s -> 19181.30s]  You see, Ben, or should I say Bob?
[19182.02s -> 19184.34s]  Your past always catches up with you.
[19186.51s -> 19191.36s]  I was a different man back then, crazy.
[19192.16s -> 19195.76s]  Drinking, I changed my ways, I swear to you.
[19196.32s -> 19197.36s]  If I could turn back...
[19197.36s -> 19197.86s]  Found him.
[19198.48s -> 19204.26s]  But you came, Bob.
[19204.26s -> 19205.54s]  Choose your destiny.
[19206.67s -> 19208.11s]  Revenge, redemption.
[19214.96s -> 19229.07s]  I think we got two different endings.
[19238.62s -> 19239.90s]  Revenge is kill.
[19239.90s -> 19241.50s]  Redemption is no kill.
[19254.54s -> 19255.58s]  I'm thinking redemption here.
[19265.79s -> 19267.55s]  But then there's also kill him.
[19269.65s -> 19271.17s]  You killed everyone in your path.
[19271.17s -> 19272.05s]  Why stop now?
[19272.05s -> 19274.77s]  Yeah, I get to the goal and I say, all right, I'm done.
[19282.37s -> 19285.79s]  Uh, one more?
[19285.79s -> 19287.79s]  Uh, I'm gonna...
[19287.79s -> 19301.58s]  Why'd you toy with me on those tales knowing I wanted to suss you out, Bob?
[19301.58s -> 19303.58s]  See what kind of man you turned out to be.
[19304.72s -> 19307.79s]  Maybe prod you into drawing on me.
[19307.79s -> 19312.35s]  See, all those years on your trail turned me into a killer.
[19312.35s -> 19318.19s]  Can't even remember who I was before you tried to murder me.
[19318.19s -> 19323.39s]  You, on the other hand, walked that very same path in exactly the opposite direction.
[19324.85s -> 19326.80s]  What do you mean by that?
[19326.80s -> 19329.36s]  You think your life is worth sparing, Bob?
[19331.39s -> 19334.61s]  We've been killing so much.
[19334.61s -> 19335.41s]  What's your name again?
[19335.41s -> 19336.21s]  We need to see what happened.
[19336.21s -> 19337.81s]  It's Eisenhower, sir.
[19337.81s -> 19338.69s]  Dwight Eisenhower.
[19338.69s -> 19339.65s]  Dwight Eisenhower.
[19339.65s -> 19342.64s]  What do you plan to do with him?
[19342.64s -> 19344.88s]  We got the Dwight Eisenhower reveal on redemption.
[19344.88s -> 19347.94s]  Tomorrow at West Point, sir.
[19347.94s -> 19348.44s]  So?
[19348.50s -> 19350.10s]  Didn't get that on revenge.
[19350.10s -> 19361.36s]  You do something decent with your life.
[19361.36s -> 19362.16s]  You hear me?
[19362.16s -> 19362.66s]  Sir?
[19363.28s -> 19363.78s]  Yes, sir.
[19364.26s -> 19371.76s]  Haven't said I left you with nothing.
[19372.64s -> 19415.27s]  Okay.
[19415.27s -> 19419.51s]  Now we can see the other ending.
[19419.51s -> 19442.24s]  All through the timeline, let's see how it ends the other way.
[19442.24s -> 19450.74s]  I knew it was gonna work as long as I didn't get to the loading screen.
[19450.74s -> 19453.62s]  See what happens with the revenge.
[19453.62s -> 19457.43s]  No, I chose redemption.
[19457.43s -> 19458.23s]  That's my choice.
[19458.23s -> 19459.27s]  That's my ending.
[19459.27s -> 19462.79s]  Let's see what happens on the other side.
[19462.79s -> 19464.61s]  This is my choice.
[19464.61s -> 19468.26s]  But we're peering into the eyes of other gamers, you know?
[19468.26s -> 19488.08s]  Don't have it said that I left you with nothing.
[19488.80s -> 19494.82s]  That's how you want it?
[19494.82s -> 19495.78s]  So be it.
[19501.33s -> 19501.83s]  Shit.
[19507.17s -> 19508.29s]  We actually get to play.
[19508.29s -> 19510.37s]  There's more gameplay with this ending.
[19510.37s -> 19517.56s]  There's no indicators either.
[19518.20s -> 19532.95s]  I'm not gonna blow it.
[19532.95s -> 19533.83s]  He's dead.
[19533.83s -> 19545.14s]  Did you know it was him all?
[19545.14s -> 19548.18s]  Cassidy told me Bob was in Abilene before he died.
[19548.18s -> 19554.40s]  I wasn't sure Ben was my man until he revealed how much he knew about Ringo and Reed.
[19554.40s -> 19555.92s]  The coin, of course.
[19556.64s -> 19560.79s]  That was the last nail in that particular coffin.
[19560.79s -> 19562.07s]  I better go get the sheriff.
[19562.71s -> 19563.59s]  You okay, boy?
[19564.15s -> 19565.43s]  You look a mite shook up.
[19565.43s -> 19567.35s]  Dwight, maybe you best go home.
[19567.35s -> 19568.71s]  See, we're never gonna know who he is.
[19570.31s -> 19570.81s]  Oh.
[19571.67s -> 19572.39s]  Never mind.
[19572.39s -> 19574.07s]  He shouldn't get caught up in something like this.
[19574.07s -> 19575.27s]  They tell you anyways.
[19575.27s -> 19578.07s]  I think I might head out myself at this juncture.
[19578.07s -> 19582.42s]  Unless you want to stop me, Jack.
[19582.42s -> 19583.14s]  Sir!
[19583.14s -> 19583.78s]  Mr. Greaves.
[19584.42s -> 19585.78s]  So where are you going now?
[19586.66s -> 19592.47s]  Now that you had your...
[19592.47s -> 19593.59s]  As I've sold my soul...
[19593.59s -> 19594.87s]  Yeah, I heard that.
[19594.87s -> 19596.23s]  And will never again walk.
[19596.87s -> 19599.06s]  There's a giant fucking gorilla.
[19599.86s -> 19601.35s]  That can talk.
[19601.35s -> 19603.11s]  You should get the whole team back together.
[19621.75s -> 19622.25s]  There it is.
[19636.88s -> 19639.28s]  That's a short little bite-sized game.
[19640.08s -> 19641.12s]  There are other game modes too.
[19641.12s -> 19642.16s]  We'll try them out.
[19642.16s -> 19647.57s]  That was fun.
[19649.28s -> 19649.84s]  Challenging.
[19651.17s -> 19653.25s]  Now I'm actually glad I played that on hard.
[19653.25s -> 19657.20s]  There's another difficulty after that.
[19661.22s -> 19662.42s]  Just a fun short little game.
[19667.68s -> 19669.84s]  I want to try the dual game mode and see how that's different.
[19670.40s -> 19673.30s]  What's my rating?
[19674.47s -> 19674.97s]  Uh...
[19678.71s -> 19680.23s]  Okay, it was like an 8...
[19680.23s -> 19681.83s]  It was like an 8-7.
[19681.83s -> 19683.59s]  It was like an 8-6, 8-7.
[19683.59s -> 19686.07s]  Until I got to that last encounter which made it like an 8-2.
[19686.79s -> 19696.68s]  It's always an 8-7.
[19696.68s -> 19697.24s]  Yeah, it is.
[19698.79s -> 19699.51s]  8-6.
[19700.07s -> 19701.59s]  That was an 8-6, 8-5.
[19713.94s -> 19714.82s]  No, it was good.
[19714.82s -> 19715.78s]  It was solid.
[19715.78s -> 19718.82s]  I don't think that was like the best video game I've ever played in my life.
[19718.82s -> 19719.70s]  But it was...
[19719.70s -> 19721.14s]  I would recommend you play it.
[19721.14s -> 19721.64s]  It was fun.
[19730.90s -> 19733.94s]  It's somewhere in that like 7 to 8, I'd say, out of 10.
[19733.94s -> 19734.90s]  Depending on who you are.
[19743.70s -> 19744.74s]  It doesn't need to be any higher.
[19744.74s -> 19749.20s]  It's just an arcade shooter with some fun mechanics.
[19755.33s -> 19757.17s]  I think I should be able just to go, right?
[19757.17s -> 19758.21s]  Nothing after the credits.
[19759.81s -> 19760.69s]  New modes are available.
[19760.69s -> 19762.29s]  A new game plus is now available.
[19762.29s -> 19764.77s]  Start a new story retaining all the unlocked skills and weapons.
[19765.41s -> 19767.25s]  True West difficulty is now available.
[19767.25s -> 19769.17s]  Try going through the story with minimal HUD.
[19769.73s -> 19774.00s]  And extra difficulty to get the real western experience.
[19775.83s -> 19776.63s]  All right, arcade.
[19776.63s -> 19777.35s]  What's arcade?
[19779.24s -> 19779.72s]  Position.
[19780.36s -> 19784.79s]  I guess you have like positions of people.
[19784.95s -> 19786.07s]  What's Lincoln County?
[19791.08s -> 19792.12s]  Arcade, Lincoln County.
[19792.68s -> 19800.56s]  So it's just score runs of the level.
[19801.67s -> 19802.95s]  Anything different in it or it's just...
[19805.01s -> 19806.93s]  Welcome to arcade mode.
[19806.93s -> 19807.89s]  It's all about the high scores.
[19807.89s -> 19809.41s]  You get points for kills and awards.
[19810.21s -> 19813.33s]  But the key to success is linking kills together into combos.
[19813.33s -> 19816.05s]  You have to finish the mission alive to keep your score.
[19816.05s -> 19816.93s]  Get it done quickly.
[19818.37s -> 19820.29s]  Gunslinger, Trapper, Ranger.
[19821.09s -> 19823.94s]  Okay.
[19825.36s -> 19826.08s]  Start game.
[19832.60s -> 19834.36s]  Each kill raises the combo by one.
[19835.32s -> 19839.57s]  All right.
[19839.57s -> 19840.77s]  Well, I can't hit anything.
[19840.77s -> 19842.05s]  Apparently, why can't I?
[19842.69s -> 19843.01s]  Bad.
[19843.65s -> 19845.43s]  Kill under the enemy.
[19845.43s -> 19846.71s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19846.71s -> 19854.10s]  This is not going to be a great score.
[19854.82s -> 19861.96s]  Like what?
[19861.96s -> 19862.44s]  Okay.
[19862.44s -> 19864.28s]  But did you see that?
[19864.92s -> 19866.20s]  Somebody has to look...
[19866.20s -> 19867.72s]  Did you see what just happened?
[19870.23s -> 19870.95s]  I did.
[19870.95s -> 19872.07s]  That's not me.
[19872.87s -> 19877.86s]  I did it three more times.
[19877.86s -> 19878.58s]  Did I shoot?
[19878.58s -> 19879.54s]  Restart.
[19879.54s -> 19927.00s]  Come on, somebody.
[19927.00s -> 19927.50s]  Anybody?
[19928.20s -> 19938.24s]  Ah, I didn't see over here.
[19938.24s -> 19938.96s]  It's been blocked.
[19939.68s -> 19962.80s]  Come on, somebody.
[19962.80s -> 19986.93s]  Damn it.
[19986.93s -> 19988.21s]  Oh, I'll take it.
[19988.21s -> 20003.44s]  Oh, no.
[20003.44s -> 20004.96s]  They shot Bill.
[20004.96s -> 20006.00s]  Poor Bill.
[20006.00s -> 20008.87s]  He was a good guy.
[20009.67s -> 20028.18s]  Oh, fuck.
[20028.18s -> 20029.06s]  Didn't even know he was there.
[20029.62s -> 20037.30s]  I can't believe he's still alive.
[20038.69s -> 20039.25s]  All right.
[20039.25s -> 20040.29s]  Clean it up here.
[20040.29s -> 20040.85s]  That was bad.
[20041.49s -> 20073.11s]  That's it.
[20073.11s -> 20077.72s]  That's it.
[20077.72s -> 20078.28s]  That's really fun.
[20078.28s -> 20082.39s]  If you can get the whole route down, it'd be kind of cool.
[20092.28s -> 20093.56s]  So to be able to get...
[20093.56s -> 20094.20s]  All right, I get it.
[20094.20s -> 20095.86s]  I understand.
[20095.86s -> 20100.68s]  So you really need to get a route down.
[20100.68s -> 20102.92s]  Unlock the skills and replay them.
[20104.87s -> 20105.43s]  One star.
[20105.43s -> 20107.51s]  Yeah, it's designed for you to get one star
[20107.51s -> 20109.59s]  and then you replay it like 50 times
[20109.59s -> 20111.27s]  and you do much better every time.
[20111.91s -> 20115.20s]  That's cool.
[20119.68s -> 20120.40s]  What about the duels?
[20120.40s -> 20121.28s]  Let me see what the duels do.
[20124.47s -> 20126.79s]  What a real pineapple response that was.
[20133.00s -> 20133.96s]  Duel challenge.
[20143.49s -> 20145.97s]  Win a series of showdowns honorably and quickly
[20145.97s -> 20147.57s]  to become a true legend of the Wild West.
[20147.57s -> 20149.49s]  You have five lives to try it again
[20149.49s -> 20151.49s]  just in case you get shot along the way.
[20151.49s -> 20173.76s]  I'm not very good at these, but I'll try.
[20182.58s -> 20183.38s]  2,000, right?
[20185.40s -> 20187.00s]  15 stages.
[20187.00s -> 20189.19s]  Oh, God.
[20190.98s -> 20193.22s]  You're going to do all 15 people in the story?
[20194.60s -> 20196.52s]  Remember the Peter Griffin joke I made?
[20196.52s -> 20197.16s]  Make it again.
[20197.16s -> 20198.04s]  Somebody in chat do it.
[20217.25s -> 20219.51s]  I'm going to lose at the last level probably.
[20227.41s -> 20228.68s]  Honorable.
[20228.68s -> 20229.32s]  Lives left.
[20230.18s -> 20230.90s]  Continue.
[20230.90s -> 20236.13s]  I remember this guy.
[20236.13s -> 20236.77s]  Oh, yeah, I do.
[20239.00s -> 20240.04s]  Old man Clanton.
[20249.80s -> 20250.84s]  Oh, shit.
[20250.84s -> 20251.88s]  You walking...
[20251.88s -> 20253.48s]  You're going way too far off camera here.
[20258.45s -> 20258.85s]  Fuck!
[20258.85s -> 20259.49s]  At the cross.
[20260.37s -> 20261.73s]  The crosshair was on him too.
[20261.73s -> 20262.77s]  Oh, damn it.
[20263.41s -> 20267.76s]  He took like so many steps to his left.
[20268.32s -> 20276.63s]  Somebody told me that this with a controller is like 30 times easier,
[20276.63s -> 20277.75s]  but I don't have one here.
[20278.39s -> 20278.87s]  Plugged in.
[20279.67s -> 20292.53s]  Got him.
[20292.53s -> 20293.17s]  All right.
[20293.17s -> 20300.04s]  Controller is scrubbed.
[20300.04s -> 20307.88s]  This is still fun though.
[20307.88s -> 20308.68s]  I wish...
[20308.68s -> 20310.28s]  Another one of my wishes.
[20310.28s -> 20311.48s]  Where's my gamer genie?
[20311.48s -> 20312.52s]  Where's my game genie?
[20313.16s -> 20314.60s]  For me to plug these things in.
[20317.25s -> 20318.69s]  So Red Dead came out, right?
[20318.69s -> 20319.73s]  Red Dead Redemption 2.
[20320.45s -> 20321.43s]  And there was...
[20322.15s -> 20323.43s]  The duels weren't...
[20324.95s -> 20325.91s]  They weren't that elaborate.
[20325.91s -> 20326.55s]  It was kind of just...
[20327.19s -> 20329.00s]  I want a game like this.
[20331.16s -> 20332.20s]  All right, I'm just like talking.
[20335.49s -> 20339.97s]  You know, a game where the intensity of a duel is there.
[20340.53s -> 20345.19s]  Different mechanics.
[20345.19s -> 20345.75s]  Breathing.
[20346.55s -> 20347.51s]  Reaction times.
[20351.49s -> 20352.05s]  Those old...
[20352.05s -> 20354.05s]  Even those games we played on the Wii.
[20354.05s -> 20356.21s]  Those old arcade cabinet games.
[20356.21s -> 20357.25s]  Mad Dog McCree and shit.
[20357.25s -> 20358.61s]  Like, I wish somebody would make one of those.
[20359.25s -> 20365.84s]  Just make the whole game about this.
[20365.84s -> 20366.88s]  And even do a multiplayer.
[20367.62s -> 20369.38s]  I mean, you'd have to have pretty good netcode,
[20369.38s -> 20382.00s]  but still it's too niche.
[20382.56s -> 20385.75s]  Yeah, but people have said that about other stuff before,
[20385.75s -> 20387.75s]  and they became fairly popular games, all right?
[20388.55s -> 20392.95s]  Why don't I just shoot the...
[20395.35s -> 20397.11s]  Why would I just shoot the barrel?
[20411.43s -> 20414.31s]  I'm just too busy focusing 100% of the barrel.
[20414.31s -> 20416.39s]  And there is a distraction.
[20417.03s -> 20418.15s]  It's just a distraction.
[20419.19s -> 20442.61s]  I dodged it.
[20443.25s -> 20448.90s]  Yeah, he's too fast.
[20458.16s -> 20459.60s]  John Harden.
[20459.60s -> 20469.83s]  Now I need that speed.
[20469.83s -> 20472.47s]  I want to almost press my eyeballs to the screen.
[20472.47s -> 20476.31s]  Can I push one eye on this left side?
[20476.31s -> 20477.19s]  I'm not going to be able to do it.
[20481.84s -> 20485.68s]  I have to go, like, frog-eyed.
[20485.68s -> 20487.36s]  I can't see them both at the same time.
[20487.92s -> 20516.21s]  Ever played Bushido Blade?
[20516.21s -> 20519.33s]  Um, that name's really familiar.
[20526.21s -> 20527.41s]  Bushido Blade.
[20527.41s -> 20528.77s]  Bushido Blade.
[20528.77s -> 20532.36s]  It's got a very familiar name.
[20532.36s -> 20545.32s]  I got this one.
[20545.32s -> 20550.31s]  It's an old PS1 game.
[20550.31s -> 20551.19s]  One hit and you die.
[20551.75s -> 20555.24s]  Is that the game with a bunch of different weapons?
[20555.88s -> 20558.52s]  It's almost like a 3D fighter.
[20558.52s -> 20560.28s]  Where you fight one person at a time.
[20560.92s -> 20567.14s]  Maybe...
[20567.14s -> 20568.18s]  Well, maybe we'll give it a try.
[20570.37s -> 20571.89s]  I vaguely remember playing that game.
[20572.61s -> 20581.28s]  Not good speed so far.
[20581.92s -> 20585.62s]  I might be able to still do it.
[20585.62s -> 20598.63s]  It's got a cool story mode where you have to fight honorably to get the best ending.
[20598.63s -> 20599.59s]  That's actually really awesome.
[20600.39s -> 20611.44s]  Just get Bushido Blade 2 if you do.
[20612.16s -> 20614.45s]  Is that one of those cases like Monster Rancher?
[20614.45s -> 20615.81s]  Where the second one is just better?
[20616.71s -> 20618.15s]  It's just a better version of the first one?
[20624.39s -> 20625.51s]  Yeah, okay.
[20625.51s -> 20655.68s]  Got them both.
[20655.68s -> 20657.20s]  You just get both for a decent price.
[20657.84s -> 20660.52s]  PlayStation 1 games are weird, though.
[20660.52s -> 20661.96s]  Some of these old games that you would think,
[20661.96s -> 20663.88s]  ah, it's probably like five bucks.
[20663.88s -> 20666.36s]  Some of them are like 50 to 100 dollars.
[20668.02s -> 20670.26s]  But if it's worth it, it's worth it, right?
[20670.90s -> 20672.18s]  I like playing on original hardware.
[20672.18s -> 20674.10s]  You know that's a meme on this channel, but it's true.
[20688.84s -> 20689.40s]  Oh, fuck!
[20689.96s -> 20691.56s]  No, no, no, no, no, no!
[20691.56s -> 20691.96s]  No!
[20691.96s -> 20692.92s]  I like my...
[20692.92s -> 20694.76s]  I have like a greasy hand right now.
[20695.40s -> 20698.79s]  I have like a fucking watery hand.
[20699.67s -> 20701.19s]  And it just like accidentally slipped.
[20709.43s -> 20710.39s]  I'll get close.
[20710.39s -> 20712.47s]  I don't know if I'll get all the way to the end, though.
[20712.47s -> 20713.59s]  This is already looking bad.
[20721.60s -> 20722.32s]  Damn it, man.
[20722.32s -> 20723.36s]  That's fucking fast.
[20726.31s -> 20727.03s]  Well, this is it.
[20757.12s -> 20758.40s]  100% speed.
[20758.40s -> 20767.94s]  I just have to do four more and not miss any shots.
[20767.94s -> 20769.56s]  Only four more.
[20769.56s -> 20802.15s]  That's it.
[20802.15s -> 20809.59s]  New high score.
[20810.23s -> 20812.39s]  Died on Jim Reid.
[20812.39s -> 20822.63s]  I could see getting addicted to that for at least a little while.
[20822.63s -> 20823.11s]  That's cool.
[20826.04s -> 20827.32s]  New game plus.
[20827.32s -> 20828.52s]  What does recollections mean?
[20831.88s -> 20832.60s]  Oh, I see.
[20832.60s -> 20834.98s]  It's the movies, the...
[20834.98s -> 20835.46s]  That's cool.
[20836.02s -> 20838.37s]  PvP would be neat.
[20838.37s -> 20838.93s]  Yeah, it would.
[20845.44s -> 20847.20s]  Wait, what am I saying?
[20848.76s -> 20849.56s]  Recollections?
[20849.56s -> 20851.08s]  The re-collections.
[20851.08s -> 20851.80s]  Recollections.
[20852.44s -> 20857.60s]  Like a 100,000 IQ streamer, right?
[20864.21s -> 20867.91s]  But I think that's a solid place to call it for tonight.
[20869.09s -> 20870.45s]  Just six hours.
[20871.09s -> 20872.85s]  I think that's a pretty decent place to call it.
[20873.49s -> 20875.91s]  I don't really want to get anything else started.
[20876.55s -> 20882.71s]  We'll do the bits.
[20882.71s -> 20883.51s]  We'll hang out for a little bit.
[20883.51s -> 20884.95s]  Should be probably like six, six and a half.
[20886.23s -> 20891.30s]  And then tomorrow, for those of you that, you know, you've been around,
[20891.30s -> 20894.66s]  you already know this, but the reason why I'm going four days in a row,
[20895.22s -> 20898.88s]  I don't typically do more than three or four days in a row,
[20899.76s -> 20903.51s]  but I'm not going to be around this next week.
[20906.37s -> 20907.33s]  My mother is coming up.
[20907.89s -> 20909.43s]  We're going to spend a bunch of time together.
[20910.07s -> 20915.67s]  I haven't seen her in a long time, so I'm going to take about five days off
[20915.67s -> 20918.47s]  because that's when she'll be here and I want to spend time with my mom.
[20918.47s -> 20919.75s]  So I'm taking a little vacation.
[20920.39s -> 20927.30s]  I'll be back because when she's gone,
[20927.30s -> 20930.98s]  I'm probably going to see her one more time.
[20933.08s -> 20936.32s]  And then I'm, you know, obviously not going to see her for like probably
[20936.32s -> 20938.72s]  another six months, a year, whenever we do something else together
[20938.72s -> 20939.84s]  as like a family, right?
[20940.56s -> 20942.53s]  So I do want to spend some time with my mother,
[20944.15s -> 20945.84s]  but I'll see you tomorrow.
[20945.84s -> 20949.30s]  Tomorrow we're going to do, we'll probably,
[20951.78s -> 20956.82s]  oh, by the way, tomorrow I'm starting at like six plus PM Pacific.
[20957.38s -> 20962.15s]  I have an appointment tomorrow, so I have to do, I'm going to the dentist.
[20962.79s -> 20965.24s]  So I got to do that in the early afternoon
[20965.24s -> 20967.80s]  and then we're just going to hang out for like a few hours
[20969.03s -> 20969.83s]  maybe a little bit more.
[20969.83s -> 20971.83s]  I might play the first episode of Sam and Max.
[20973.88s -> 20974.76s]  We'll hang out.
[20974.76s -> 20976.20s]  There's a couple of videos that I want to watch.
[20977.89s -> 20980.61s]  So tomorrow, there's no plan at all tomorrow.
[20980.61s -> 20983.78s]  I just wanted to go live again
[20983.78s -> 20985.70s]  because I'm not going to be live for a long time.
[20985.70s -> 20988.82s]  So I want to put the time in for you guys.
[20988.82s -> 20989.78s]  I want to see you guys.
[20989.78s -> 20991.22s]  I'm not going to see you for a while.
[20991.22s -> 20996.05s]  So we're just going in completely no plan tomorrow.
[20996.61s -> 21002.56s]  Should be fun.
[21002.56s -> 21003.60s]  I got good dental.
[21007.35s -> 21009.03s]  Please play more Telltale games.
[21009.03s -> 21009.83s]  We'll see.
[21009.83s -> 21012.47s]  Has my mom ever seen what I do for a living?
[21012.47s -> 21012.97s]  Yeah.
[21014.71s -> 21015.21s]  She knows.
[21016.20s -> 21017.08s]  Oh, yeah.
[21017.08s -> 21024.14s]  She's very well aware.
[21024.14s -> 21025.26s]  But thanks for watching tonight.
[21028.20s -> 21028.92s]  I hope you enjoyed.
[21029.48s -> 21033.53s]  I wanted just to kind of chill, relax, and play a game
[21033.53s -> 21035.90s]  that I've wanted to play for a while.
[21035.90s -> 21039.02s]  So we just kind of hung out and played Gunslinger
[21039.02s -> 21039.66s]  and it was great.
[21039.66s -> 21043.08s]  So it was a real comfy stream today.
[21043.08s -> 21043.64s]  I liked it.
[21046.81s -> 21050.25s]  Kind of needed this after the insanity of the last week or two.
[21056.76s -> 21058.20s]  But let's get to the bits.
[21058.84s -> 21059.88s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[21060.44s -> 21063.16s]  Late afternoon somewhere around like six o'clock Pacific.
[21063.88s -> 21064.44s]  Depending.
[21064.44s -> 21066.36s]  I don't really have like an exact time
[21066.36s -> 21068.68s]  because I don't know how long I'm going to be at this point before.
[21068.68s -> 21073.58s]  But regardless, I'll see you.
[21073.58s -> 21075.66s]  If you're going to come hang out tomorrow, we'll see you tomorrow.
[21075.66s -> 21080.17s]  Has my mother watched the streams?
[21080.17s -> 21080.67s]  No.
[21082.94s -> 21085.90s]  I think it's one of those cases where she's like,
[21085.90s -> 21088.87s]  I know what you do and it's great.
[21088.87s -> 21090.55s]  But she's not going to sit here and watch.
[21091.19s -> 21093.78s]  My mother's very supportive.
[21093.78s -> 21094.26s]  She's great.
[21095.14s -> 21095.78s]  She really is.
[21096.50s -> 21098.22s]  And I can't wait to see her.
[21098.22s -> 21099.50s]  So I'm excited.
[21099.50s -> 21100.30s]  She'll be here real soon.
[21100.86s -> 21106.14s]  But let's go back earlier this afternoon.
[21107.77s -> 21110.57s]  To Afro Ninja, thanks for the five dollars.
[21111.37s -> 21111.77s]  Thank you.
[21113.05s -> 21114.97s]  Thank you, Zorro Carlos for the 250.
[21114.97s -> 21117.53s]  The title of this game sounds like a Family Guy cutaway joke
[21117.53s -> 21120.97s]  about some Mexican Call of Duty knockoff.
[21125.46s -> 21127.46s]  Family Guy cutaway joke.
[21128.02s -> 21136.98s]  And I made a Family Guy reference that he did have the green pants,
[21136.98s -> 21139.62s]  the white button up, and he was like had a fat stomach.
[21141.05s -> 21142.49s]  That's just the Peter Griffin.
[21143.05s -> 21143.45s]  It is.
[21144.50s -> 21145.22s]  I'm sorry.
[21145.78s -> 21154.01s]  Thank you, some guy for the 15 dollars.
[21154.01s -> 21157.27s]  It's been a long time since I posted a meme video.
[21158.63s -> 21163.75s]  Hopefully, a meme video lasts and hopefully, and honestly, sorry,
[21164.47s -> 21167.21s]  I still don't have a good video to show you.
[21167.21s -> 21170.90s]  But anyway, here's Sharktail for three minutes.
[21173.85s -> 21175.53s]  I don't want to watch Sharktail.
[21179.32s -> 21182.52s]  This is Sharktail times 31 speed.
[21182.52s -> 21192.92s]  Somebody had to upload this.
[21198.26s -> 21200.34s]  Is this some weird fucked up way to get around the
[21201.86s -> 21203.94s]  YouTube algorithm to catch content ID?
[21204.58s -> 21210.18s]  Do you download this video and then undo the times 31 speed?
[21210.18s -> 21214.82s]  Is that how that works?
[21217.56s -> 21220.36s]  Do you slow it down until you can comprehend it?
[21223.11s -> 21225.75s]  Well, thank you for the 15 dollars, first of all, some guy.
[21225.75s -> 21228.47s]  And thanks for the whole entire Sharktail.
[21231.56s -> 21232.68s]  It's a three minute video.
[21233.56s -> 21235.00s]  It's the whole movie, I guess.
[21237.50s -> 21237.98s]  Thank you.
[21238.70s -> 21239.82s]  I appreciate it.
[21249.11s -> 21251.43s]  Thank you, Spicy Pepe's for five dollars.
[21252.07s -> 21253.77s]  Hey, Jeremiah, I hope you're doing well.
[21253.77s -> 21257.45s]  Just wanted to say that I really appreciate you and all that you do on these streams.
[21257.45s -> 21260.65s]  I've been watching you a couple of years now and every time I click on an old YouTube video,
[21260.65s -> 21262.01s]  I'll hop into one of your streams.
[21262.01s -> 21263.85s]  I know I'll be laughing throughout it all.
[21263.85s -> 21266.57s]  I think you're the most genuine and caring human on the planet.
[21266.57s -> 21267.29s]  And you're the best.
[21269.74s -> 21271.50s]  Thank you for the five dollars, Spicy Pepe's.
[21271.50s -> 21276.31s]  And thank you for an incredibly kind fucking message.
[21277.85s -> 21280.14s]  That's thank you.
[21280.78s -> 21292.84s]  Those are, there's a lot of things that I'm glad you think of this community in these streams.
[21292.84s -> 21294.36s]  So thank you so much.
[21294.36s -> 21295.24s]  I really appreciate it.
[21295.80s -> 21302.20s]  Thank you, Smelly Boy for the 250.
[21302.20s -> 21303.72s]  Johnny Test Whip Crack.
[21304.28s -> 21307.59s]  Is that a sound effect?
[21311.66s -> 21313.58s]  AtroLux Atrix, thanks for the three bucks.
[21313.58s -> 21315.50s]  Hey, Jeremiah, can you pretend this is a 50 dollars?
[21315.50s -> 21317.26s]  I remember that, that was from earlier.
[21317.26s -> 21318.14s]  That was AtroLux.
[21320.97s -> 21322.65s]  That really confused me so much.
[21323.29s -> 21326.36s]  And then AtroLux again gave 250.
[21326.36s -> 21327.72s]  All right, I didn't expect that.
[21327.72s -> 21328.28s]  Thanks, Jeremiah.
[21328.28s -> 21329.64s]  That was accidental comedy.
[21332.39s -> 21335.16s]  Can you pretend this is 50 dollars?
[21343.74s -> 21348.38s]  Thank you, CADBTV, resident game developer here.
[21349.10s -> 21350.06s]  Thanks for the 250.
[21350.06s -> 21352.06s]  Hey, Jeremiah, I've never played this game before.
[21352.06s -> 21353.82s]  Is the objective to shoot the buildings?
[21353.82s -> 21354.62s]  You're doing great.
[21359.50s -> 21361.58s]  50 plus percent every time.
[21362.30s -> 21365.85s]  Some of those levels were 75, 71 percent.
[21365.85s -> 21368.81s]  That means seven out of every 10 shots landed into somebody.
[21369.53s -> 21372.65s]  Come on, on hard mode too?
[21373.61s -> 21374.57s]  That's not bad.
[21374.57s -> 21375.61s]  That's fine.
[21375.61s -> 21376.65s]  What's wrong with that?
[21376.65s -> 21378.65s]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[21379.53s -> 21381.18s]  Why is that?
[21381.18s -> 21382.14s]  That's like good.
[21383.02s -> 21384.06s]  That's good.
[21384.06s -> 21384.46s]  It is.
[21385.98s -> 21387.26s]  I'm going to toot my horn here
[21387.26s -> 21388.46s]  because there is no horn to toot.
[21388.46s -> 21389.02s]  That's good.
[21390.63s -> 21393.27s]  60 to 70 percent accuracy on hard mode in the game.
[21393.27s -> 21393.67s]  That's okay.
[21393.67s -> 21394.15s]  That's fine.
[21395.03s -> 21395.51s]  That's fine.
[21395.51s -> 21396.63s]  You don't have to worry.
[21396.63s -> 21398.31s]  What do I have to worry about?
[21398.31s -> 21404.12s]  Give us closure on if you're going to play God Hand or not.
[21405.16s -> 21405.80s]  I don't know.
[21405.80s -> 21407.80s]  I don't know what I'm going to have for breakfast tomorrow.
[21408.52s -> 21414.39s]  Are you saying that you missed 25 percent of the buildings you were shooting at?
[21415.03s -> 21417.96s]  Let's just say yes, I guess.
[21427.96s -> 21428.76s]  You guys, man.
[21428.76s -> 21431.16s]  Sometimes you guys are fucking crazy.
[21433.08s -> 21433.56s]  I love it.
[21434.44s -> 21437.82s]  Thank you, an anonymous cheerer for the $10.
[21440.46s -> 21443.26s]  Sometimes words explode inside my brain and they run into each other.
[21443.98s -> 21445.98s]  1000 bits from an anonymous cheerer.
[21445.98s -> 21446.46s]  10 bucks.
[21448.84s -> 21450.36s]  Thank you, whoever you are.
[21451.00s -> 21453.88s]  Whoever you are.
[21453.88s -> 21455.66s]  And then we had a bunch of community subs.
[21455.66s -> 21457.50s]  Jerma's average dong gave a bunch.
[21457.50s -> 21458.70s]  Pixel Mike gave a bunch.
[21461.59s -> 21464.79s]  Lots and lots of community subs given a couple hours ago.
[21464.79s -> 21465.35s]  Thank you, guys.
[21466.84s -> 21468.28s]  Chunky baloney, thanks for the $5.
[21468.28s -> 21470.12s]  Buy yourself some double cheeseburgers on me.
[21470.76s -> 21475.19s]  I really want a crispy thin crust pepperoni pizza right now.
[21475.83s -> 21481.18s]  We'll be talking about it earlier.
[21481.98s -> 21483.90s]  I'm just super like, I'm relaxed.
[21484.54s -> 21489.77s]  Anybody else just totally relaxed right now?
[21490.33s -> 21494.09s]  I'm just going to eat some pizza
[21494.09s -> 21501.58s]  and just sit on the couch and just, I can't wait.
[21501.58s -> 21502.70s]  Quick, somebody stress him out.
[21502.70s -> 21503.18s]  Don't do that.
[21503.74s -> 21505.66s]  I'm in a great spot right now.
[21505.66s -> 21506.86s]  What do you mean stress him out?
[21508.66s -> 21509.78s]  I'm frustrated with you.
[21509.78s -> 21510.10s]  Why?
[21510.10s -> 21510.42s]  What?
[21510.42s -> 21510.74s]  Why?
[21511.46s -> 21512.18s]  What are you talking about?
[21512.18s -> 21513.94s]  Just, we're just having, we're just relaxing.
[21514.66s -> 21516.78s]  Everyone's starting to stress me out.
[21524.41s -> 21525.93s]  Don't mess with my vibe, dude.
[21536.22s -> 21537.74s]  Everybody thinks you're an idiot.
[21538.38s -> 21539.10s]  No, they don't.
[21541.00s -> 21541.64s]  That's a joke.
[21541.64s -> 21542.92s]  It's a meme on the channel.
[21542.92s -> 21544.28s]  I made it up, I said.
[21544.28s -> 21545.64s]  I went, oh, I'm dumb.
[21546.52s -> 21548.68s]  Like four years ago, and everybody just doesn't know.
[21549.32s -> 21550.76s]  It's a meme on the channel, it's a joke.
[21550.76s -> 21552.92s]  Every time anybody says it, it's a funny thing that we do.
[21559.48s -> 21561.48s]  Yeah, I made that up four years ago.
[21562.57s -> 21564.73s]  And I said, it's going to be wicked funny
[21564.73s -> 21566.41s]  because everyone's going to keep saying this.
[21566.41s -> 21569.21s]  And I want this to be a thing on the channel, like guys dumb.
[21570.97s -> 21571.93s]  And people still do it now.
[21571.93s -> 21572.49s]  I'm surprised.
[21572.49s -> 21577.05s]  It's cool to see that the like streamers dumb joke
[21577.05s -> 21579.29s]  that I made that I told you guys that was funny to do.
[21580.01s -> 21582.12s]  Um, you guys still do it.
[21582.12s -> 21582.60s]  It's great.
[21582.60s -> 21583.16s]  I think it's fun.
[21597.06s -> 21598.26s]  He's deflecting.
[21598.90s -> 21600.22s]  Yeah.
[21600.22s -> 21600.86s]  Oh, wouldn't you?
[21601.66s -> 21605.27s]  If a stranger walked up to you and said, hey, hey, dude, you're dumb.
[21606.73s -> 21607.37s]  What would you do?
[21609.78s -> 21613.88s]  But first of all, you were like trying to get into the sewer, right?
[21614.76s -> 21617.00s]  You were trying to like get into the sewer with your bare hands.
[21619.94s -> 21621.54s]  But still, like, let me do me, right?
[21621.54s -> 21624.10s]  Like, would you go up to that guy and be like, hey, dude, you're dumb.
[21624.10s -> 21625.86s]  No, he's just trying to get in the sewer, whatever.
[21626.50s -> 21631.64s]  Well, okay.
[21631.64s -> 21634.92s]  If I forgot, I was just like yelling about pop tarts or something on the sidewalk.
[21634.92s -> 21636.76s]  Would you walk up to him and go, hey, dude, you're stupid.
[21637.64s -> 21638.28s]  Hey, wouldn't you?
[21638.28s -> 21640.12s]  Would be like, oh, that guy's just kind of weird.
[21640.12s -> 21640.92s]  Let him do what he's going to do.
[21641.72s -> 21646.98s]  You wouldn't do that.
[21648.33s -> 21649.45s]  You wouldn't download a car.
[21652.07s -> 21652.39s]  Okay.
[21661.53s -> 21662.81s]  Uh, thank you too.
[21662.81s -> 21663.53s]  Where are we here?
[21663.53s -> 21664.65s]  Jerma's average dong.
[21666.38s -> 21667.10s]  No, that's Jerma's.
[21667.10s -> 21669.42s]  There's so many Jerma's name something.
[21669.42s -> 21670.78s]  Jerma lied about Minecraft.
[21670.78s -> 21671.50s]  Jerma's dick.
[21671.50s -> 21672.38s]  Jerma's dong.
[21672.38s -> 21674.46s]  Jerma lied about fruity loops.
[21684.10s -> 21688.42s]  Thank you, Jerma lied about Minecraft VR for the five community subs right now.
[21690.50s -> 21691.78s]  Maybe you should stop lying.
[21692.58s -> 21693.94s]  Half of these are not even about lying.
[21693.94s -> 21695.22s]  They're about my, like, penis.
[21696.02s -> 21696.98s]  What do you mean lying?
[21706.71s -> 21708.63s]  What does that have to do with me telling anything?
[21711.61s -> 21712.17s]  Liar.
[21712.73s -> 21713.69s]  Oh my God.
[21715.03s -> 21717.91s]  But thank you to smelly boy for the 250.
[21717.91s -> 21719.27s]  This game is so cool.
[21719.27s -> 21720.55s]  It was very cool.
[21720.55s -> 21721.11s]  I liked it.
[21723.35s -> 21724.07s]  Thank you.
[21724.07s -> 21725.43s]  Have gun for the 250.
[21725.43s -> 21725.91s]  Hey, Jerma.
[21725.91s -> 21729.11s]  Did you notice that all the level names are the names of western movies?
[21729.11s -> 21730.31s]  Just altered a little bit.
[21730.31s -> 21731.75s]  I didn't even pick that up.
[21731.75s -> 21732.23s]  That's cool.
[21732.95s -> 21740.76s]  I guess the good, the bad, and the yeah, I could see that.
[21740.76s -> 21745.08s]  That's very cool.
[21745.08s -> 21753.62s]  Uh, thank you castle.
[21753.62s -> 21756.74s]  Thank you castleon or castleion for the five dollars.
[21757.38s -> 21761.22s]  Just paying you back for spamming your chat with history facts about the guys you killed.
[21767.70s -> 21768.98s]  That's fucking funny.
[21768.98s -> 21774.06s]  I'm surprised you didn't get, like, timed out.
[21779.38s -> 21780.10s]  That's cool though.
[21784.71s -> 21786.07s]  Knowledge with our games, right?
[21793.42s -> 21794.46s]  Mods were nice to me.
[21794.46s -> 21795.10s]  Well, that's good.
[21795.74s -> 21801.24s]  But thank you for the five dollars and thanks for the, uh, history.
[21802.58s -> 21810.52s]  Thank you.
[21810.52s -> 21812.28s]  Thank you pretty support for the five dollars.
[21812.92s -> 21814.68s]  Sleep tight, streamer.
[21814.68s -> 21815.46s]  I'll try.
[21817.00s -> 21817.64s]  I will try.
[21818.36s -> 21831.21s]  Sleeping, I told you, my biggest, my biggest superpower that I wish I had was
[21832.39s -> 21833.91s]  being able to go like this and go to bed.
[21834.71s -> 21836.39s]  Although that would be not good because if anybody,
[21836.39s -> 21838.23s]  if you snapped for some reason, you'd just fall asleep.
[21844.87s -> 21846.71s]  Sometimes that would, it would be good, but it wouldn't.
[21846.71s -> 21847.99s]  It would have to be something very specific.
[21848.63s -> 21853.54s]  It'd have to be, like, snap three times in a row and then, like, say a series of words.
[21853.54s -> 21858.26s]  I remember reading, uh, there was a thing on Reddit before about what would your superpower be or,
[21858.82s -> 21862.02s]  or if you, if everybody had the same superpower or something,
[21862.82s -> 21867.11s]  whatever it was, somebody said that, like, the only way that it would make it so I could
[21867.11s -> 21871.27s]  fly or if everybody could have the same superpower, but you could add something to
[21871.27s -> 21876.15s]  it or something, and one of the, one of the comments said something like,
[21876.15s -> 21878.47s]  I would make it so everybody had the ability to fly,
[21879.74s -> 21886.79s]  but I only knew that it took this insane regimen of things to do before it worked.
[21886.79s -> 21888.55s]  So nobody, we know what I'm talking about.
[21889.27s -> 21898.31s]  Produce an infinite amount of spaghetti sauce.
[21898.31s -> 21903.34s]  I don't know, but infinite.
[21907.02s -> 21909.50s]  Nice joke that I wasn't, I'm not making a joke.
[21909.50s -> 21912.30s]  There was a thing with, I, I can't remember it.
[21912.30s -> 21914.70s]  I shouldn't have even started talking about it because I don't even remember it.
[21914.70s -> 21916.38s]  I remember it was something like that though where
[21916.94s -> 21919.34s]  you choose a superpower, but everybody gets to have it.
[21920.06s -> 21924.26s]  Just type in superpower, everybody gets to have it, reddit,
[21924.26s -> 21926.10s]  and you'll find the cool comment that that guy put.
[21931.46s -> 21933.14s]  But let me get the credits up.
[21933.14s -> 21934.90s]  We have a couple more bits left.
[21935.62s -> 21940.10s]  Let's see those community subs fly on by.
[21940.10s -> 21940.66s]  What do you say?
[21943.66s -> 21945.18s]  Thank you Devakitty for the three dollars.
[21946.89s -> 21952.65s]  I got to go on a six hour train ride twice in one day to get hormone treatment
[21952.65s -> 21956.01s]  because I made the journey here two weeks ago, but only when I got to the hospital
[21956.01s -> 21957.53s]  he told me my appointment was canceled.
[21958.33s -> 21962.81s]  So I returned home feeling very defeated and your streams helped me through a tough break.
[21963.61s -> 21964.89s]  Thank you for being such a good streamer.
[21965.53s -> 21966.73s]  They say transgender pride.
[21968.31s -> 21971.43s]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that that didn't go well.
[21974.33s -> 21975.45s]  Back and forth that sucks.
[21976.09s -> 21984.76s]  Thank you for being here.
[21990.02s -> 21994.38s]  Sorry that it's not, that didn't go well, but there's another day, right?
[21999.93s -> 22003.75s]  Glad to have a spot where people can just hang out and have fun.
[22004.39s -> 22008.12s]  It's the only thing I fucking care about, so.
[22011.21s -> 22012.01s]  Fun.
[22012.01s -> 22014.87s]  I'm glad people can have it here.
[22021.66s -> 22022.30s]  Whoa, whoops.
[22024.46s -> 22025.58s]  Feed me ads.
[22030.25s -> 22031.45s]  I'm gonna do two ads.
[22031.45s -> 22031.93s]  Just wait.
[22035.45s -> 22036.41s]  Cheer 500.
[22036.41s -> 22037.45s]  God damn it, I fucked it up.
[22037.45s -> 22038.41s]  Play oblivion again.
[22039.37s -> 22040.87s]  Why did that work?
[22042.82s -> 22043.54s]  It just, it did.
[22047.18s -> 22048.78s]  Hey, peek a banana, thanks for the 250.
[22049.42s -> 22051.05s]  That just saved your heart, thank you.
[22051.77s -> 22055.96s]  If you're gonna play Sam and Max tomorrow and you're starting with episode one,
[22055.96s -> 22056.84s]  don't get the wrong impression.
[22056.84s -> 22059.88s]  It starts off slow because there's six episodes and it gets way better.
[22060.76s -> 22063.58s]  Well, whatever.
[22063.58s -> 22064.06s]  That's fine.
[22064.70s -> 22069.34s]  I'm only gonna do, I'll do the first episode, right?
[22071.00s -> 22074.20s]  We'll have like four, probably like three to five hours to kill.
[22074.92s -> 22089.96s]  So we'll have plenty of time to do at least one.
[22089.96s -> 22095.21s]  Play all, there are three different games of Sam and Max.
[22098.60s -> 22100.20s]  Bingo sunshine, five dollars.
[22100.20s -> 22101.16s]  Good to my word.
[22101.16s -> 22102.44s]  Play oblivion though.
[22104.78s -> 22106.70s]  You didn't have to do that, it's all right.
[22106.70s -> 22107.34s]  Thank you, Phil.
[22108.06s -> 22113.85s]  Look at all these fucking subs rolling by.
[22114.81s -> 22116.17s]  Can you play every game ever?
[22116.97s -> 22118.65s]  Well, I will get in there.
[22119.37s -> 22128.60s]  I've played a lot of the old ones, but thank you all.
[22129.24s -> 22129.96s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[22130.60s -> 22135.27s]  We're gonna do, it's not, there is no plan.
[22137.74s -> 22140.22s]  I might just do like a little bit of Sam and Max.
[22140.22s -> 22147.26s]  I might watch a few videos and then we might just do fucking chat roulette.
[22147.26s -> 22147.82s]  You know what I mean?
[22148.62s -> 22150.54s]  Where, what game am I gonna play?
[22150.54s -> 22151.10s]  Whatever it is.
[22152.71s -> 22153.35s]  Try this one.
[22153.35s -> 22154.63s]  Okay, maybe we'll play for like an hour.
[22169.48s -> 22171.00s]  VR chat on open.
[22171.64s -> 22172.60s]  I don't know about that.
[22173.56s -> 22177.05s]  That doesn't mean what you think it means.
[22178.82s -> 22183.06s]  No, I mean like in chat, we're like just pick a random,
[22183.06s -> 22184.90s]  somebody said something and I pick it and we play it.
[22185.86s -> 22187.06s]  Oh god, okay.
[22187.78s -> 22190.94s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[22190.94s -> 22193.02s]  Probably around like six o'clock Pacific.
[22193.02s -> 22194.30s]  I'll set the sauce accordingly.
[22194.94s -> 22195.58s]  See you soon.
[22195.58s -> 22196.30s]  Thanks for hanging out.
[22197.58s -> 22201.18s]  I'm glad I actually got to play gunslinger because it was a very solid,
[22203.05s -> 22203.77s]  cool, fun game.
[22205.13s -> 22206.89s]  Thank you for experiencing it with me.
[22207.83s -> 22208.39s]  See you tomorrow.
[22209.19s -> 22209.99s]  Take care of yourselves.
[22212.55s -> 22213.99s]  9 p.m. Eastern stream.
[22213.99s -> 22216.95s]  Yeah, it's because I got a, I have a dentist appointment that I can't miss.
[22217.75s -> 22222.55s]  It's probably gonna be a while scheduled.
[22223.35s -> 22228.66s]  So I'm gonna be there for a little while.
[22228.66s -> 22231.46s]  I'll see you whenever I get, I'll probably turn it on at some point.
[22232.86s -> 22234.78s]  Up to before six, maybe a little after.
[22234.78s -> 22235.10s]  I don't know.
[22235.10s -> 22235.98s]  We're just gonna do whatever.
[22236.86s -> 22238.58s]  See you soon.
[22238.58s -> 22238.98s]  Take care.
[22241.48s -> 22242.60s]  And no, not good night.
[22243.32s -> 22243.96s]  Not good night.
[22243.96s -> 22246.01s]  I'm gonna run two ads.
[22246.01s -> 22250.01s]  Otherwise people are gonna scream at me the next time I turn my stream on.
[22251.46s -> 22255.96s]  So let's run a couple ads.
[22255.96s -> 22258.44s]  Here comes a 60 second ad break.
[22259.32s -> 22261.82s]  See you guys later.
[22264.23s -> 22264.71s]  Good night.
[22265.61s -> 22266.01s]  Goodbye.
[22267.83s -> 22278.55s]  Take care.
[22278.55s -> 22280.23s]  Turning off ad block for this one.
[22280.79s -> 22289.18s]  And we'll see, we'll see what they get.
[22289.18s -> 22289.98s]  What'd you get?
[22289.98s -> 22290.70s]  Samsung?
[22290.70s -> 22291.20s]  Nice.
[22292.14s -> 22298.62s]  Stream Legends.
[22299.18s -> 22305.80s]  Stream Legends unfortunately is not ready yet because I went very into the early
[22305.80s -> 22306.76s]  morning this morning.
[22308.04s -> 22315.03s]  So I did that at somewhere around 1 a.m. Pacific today.
[22316.86s -> 22319.82s]  So that's not this, I can't do that for a long time.
[22325.10s -> 22325.82s]  Didn't get an ad?
[22325.82s -> 22326.62s]  Well I ran them.
[22326.62s -> 22328.86s]  I'm telling you, they're ending in five seconds.
[22329.50s -> 22334.30s]  And there it is.
[22334.30s -> 22334.70s]  That's it.
[22335.50s -> 22337.54s]  I will see you guys real soon.
[22338.63s -> 22339.75s]  Take care of yourselves.
[22339.75s -> 22340.39s]  Have a good one.
[22341.90s -> 22342.30s]  Good night.
