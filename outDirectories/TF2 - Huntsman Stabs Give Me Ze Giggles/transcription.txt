[0.31s -> 44.11s]  Not on my watch. Not on my watch. I got him. What the what the hell just happened? What just happened? Why did he not die? What? What is going on right now, man? All right, time to make things interesting. Stipulation for this life is I got to get three headshots in a row. If I don't get three headshots in a row, then my fucking computer explodes. All right, guys?
[44.15s -> 80.52s]  Here we go. This one is one baby. We're gonna get two. No, it's all right. As long as I don't hit them. There's two. There's two. All right. Looking good. Looking good. Looking good. And there's three. No, no, no. Wait, wait. Double it up. Just be quiet about it. Don't let anybody know you're there. Holy shit. You just got knocked so far in the air, man. I'm up in their little base. I'm up in their area. Now it's just a matter of time.
[80.52s -> 122.89s]  Before I can catch somebody. Right? Peek around the corner. Nobody coming. I don't want this. I want a sniper to come. I don't want them to see me. Right? I need to be like, okay. Okay. Here's a sniper. He just saw me, but he's not gonna know I'm here. He didn't even get me. He didn't even. You saw. He didn't even get me. He hit the wall behind him. He hit the wall behind him. Same deal. This time. I'm getting this guy. I'll take you. What the hell are you doing?
[122.89s -> 161.05s]  What's this guy doing? Why is he? What is this guy doing? Did I just really do that? I didn't just really do that. Did I? Am I in a dream? Pinch me. Somebody wake me up. Okay. Well, I'll take it. I'm waiting for him. You see this guy. This guy's gonna get it. This guy's gonna get it. There he is again. It's the same pyro. Isn't it? Is it the same pyro? I don't know what the hell he's doing. He's just chilling out. Now he's gone. What is he?
[161.05s -> 215.42s]  What? Because remember, nobody besides a scout ever goes around this side. Just wrap around. See, it's all scouts and this one sniper. You know, it's all scouts. Accidental. Whoopsie. I didn't mean to. Let's move on. He fucked up. What? What is? You're gonna see a taunt kill like you've never seen before. This guy is a spy.
[215.42s -> 246.37s]  The spy has no idea that I know he's a spy. Are you kidding me? Please tell me I got him. Oh my god. Oh no. I love how he cloaked. He saw me coming and he realized I knew he was a spy and he was like, oh wait, no, you can't see me. He was still in the same spot though. Here he is again. My goodness. Oh my goodness.
[246.37s -> 248.50s]  This time, hopefully nothing screws up. Line it up for when this scout comes up the stairs. He is going to wish he was never born. I mistimed it. It's okay. It's all right. It's all right. We can hand the shit out of this guy. He doesn't want none. He wants none. Oh, he don't want none of that. He doesn't want none of that. Let's go. Sniper. Oblivious sniper. Oblivious. All right, guys, it's time to, uh, time to call my shots. Thank the good old babe. Babe Ruth.
[286.53s -> 320.24s]  No, no, we're not talking about the candy bar, not baby Ruth. We're talking about Babe Ruth, the legend, the master of the diamond cutter. Babe Ruth used to call his shots. See, I kept shooting the spy in the face, called it. What the fuck is the sentry doing out here on our side? You know the drill. Second those span doors open. It's time to rock it. You ready? Good. Make sure I get my ammo. Span doors are going to open. Span doors are now closing. It's time to turn it on, guys. You know how we do here. You know how we do it.
[320.24s -> 358.14s]  We're going to get at least five kills in a row right here. I ain't messing around. There's one. I told you. I told you right when those span doors closed. You ain't messing around with me now. I got really mad right there. Span door. That was a pretty good span shot. That's what we're talking about here, guys. That's two. Ready for this one? Yeah, I got you. I got you. It's three. No, no, I'm out of my pyros. Close the span door.
