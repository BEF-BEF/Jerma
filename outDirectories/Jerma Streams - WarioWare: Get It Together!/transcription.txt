[3.13s -> 7.70s]  I didn't mean to turn this on. I pressed enter on the streamlabs
[7.70s -> 13.70s]  thing. I have it enter as go live. Um, it's actually gonna like delay the stream to tomorrow. So,
[14.90s -> 18.42s]  uh, sorry about that. I, um, I, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[21.53s -> 32.07s]  Hey guys, how you doing? Welcome back. Psycho.
[33.11s -> 36.39s]  Gotta start. I'm excited. I'm ready to go. This is WarioWare.
[38.68s -> 41.40s]  This is the week of games that I've been waiting for for a decade.
[43.19s -> 48.46s]  Ever since Smooth Moves, I've been begging Nintendo to come up with a new one of these.
[49.18s -> 57.32s]  And I don't count game in Wario. That one doesn't count. This is a WarioWare game from scratch,
[58.04s -> 69.77s]  ready to go, on Switch, fully developed, fully ready. I heard it's short, but, you know, whatever.
[73.30s -> 81.35s]  We'll see how short. From what I have seen, it takes anywhere from three to four hours to
[81.35s -> 86.94s]  see everything. We'll see. But I'm really happy. I'm really, uh, I'm really into it.
[86.94s -> 91.74s]  I think it's gonna be fun. I don't know. I don't want to give any judgments until I play it.
[92.30s -> 101.29s]  The new system seems a little weird. Seems kind of weird. Yeah, I'm very early. I was just ready.
[101.93s -> 106.76s]  Sometimes I'm just ready. Not every time, obviously. Sometimes I'm just ready to go.
[107.80s -> 113.19s]  That is one of those times today. Hot dog, thanks for the five community subs. Appreciate it.
[113.19s -> 121.10s]  So the plan here today is we're gonna play WarioWare, and then after WarioWare,
[121.66s -> 126.89s]  it really depends on how long this game is. If this game, in like an hour or two,
[127.45s -> 130.92s]  I'm done with it. It's like, oh, that was cool, but I did everything, and I did everything I
[130.92s -> 135.90s]  wanted to do. I have to, I highly doubt that's gonna happen. And I'll just do No More Heroes 3
[135.90s -> 141.38s]  tonight. If not, if this game takes at least three or four hours, and I'm having a good time,
[141.38s -> 146.68s]  then we'll just do No More Heroes 3 tomorrow. So you're really gonna get two short streams
[146.68s -> 157.06s]  back-to-back, or one long stream tonight. We'll find out. Thank you, AStraightPube.
[159.50s -> 164.25s]  Are you allowed to have that name? Is that at least in that busy piece of cube?
[165.19s -> 177.86s]  Thanks for the 10 community subs, I appreciate it. Whatever. So yeah, I'm ready to go. I think,
[178.66s -> 194.04s]  should we delay any longer? We're just going emote only? What happened? We did. Hey, thanks,
[194.04s -> 201.96s]  Spigot. Thank you, K5. Five community subs. There's a bug with huge emojis some people are getting,
[201.96s -> 214.47s]  trying to sort it out. Wait, what? Huge emojis? Well, let's see what happens.
[214.47s -> 222.26s]  WarioWare, get it together. I'm ready. There's like a character selector in this one, too.
[222.90s -> 226.66s]  And yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I'm gonna do a face cam. Everybody just relax,
[227.38s -> 233.45s]  because I'm going to be going like this. So of course, you have to have a face cam
[233.45s -> 245.99s]  on for this shit. Hey Casper, thanks for the five community subs. You guys ready? All right,
[245.99s -> 256.63s]  so this is just, I unlock shit as we go. I can't see what they're saying. What are they saying
[256.63s -> 265.72s]  about me? Thank you, facade, facadecake for the five community subs, appreciate it. I'm ready to
[265.72s -> 277.45s]  go. How many players? One. All right, so he plays Wario. Wario intro games. Change the number of
[277.45s -> 285.27s]  plays. No, excuse me. You can play Metroid? Probably. No, that's a lie. I don't really play
[285.27s -> 290.73s]  the Metroid games as much as I like pretend to. Metroid is a series that I pretend that I know
[290.73s -> 296.33s]  anything about, because I think people would think I was cool if I knew about it. I made a tweet.
[297.05s -> 301.93s]  Here's a fun fact about my Twitter. I made a tweet like three or four years ago. I believe
[301.93s -> 307.80s]  it said something like this. It took Nintendo five years of making Yarn games to realize that
[307.80s -> 315.67s]  Metroid was a cool series. I've never played through any of the Metroid games, any of them,
[315.67s -> 321.83s]  not even the Super Nintendo one. None of them. So why am I making a comment like that?
[322.55s -> 330.71s]  I was, yeah, I was a poser. I was a fake fan. I was. I'm like, this is WarioWare. I'm ready.
[330.71s -> 336.10s]  That was a lie? Well, I didn't lie. I just, I didn't say, oh my god, I'm such a huge fan of
[336.10s -> 341.75s]  Metroid. I can't wait for the new one. I just made like a joke about how they made a bunch of
[341.75s -> 345.99s]  Yarn games, but I didn't play any of the Metroid games. You know, no, I went like this.
[348.06s -> 355.26s]  Come, come, come, come, come. In Metroid Prime, Wii, and then I never played it ever again. Oh,
[355.26s -> 361.50s]  and then I also rented from Blockbuster a copy of Metroid, Super Metroid. But it was like halfway
[361.50s -> 366.74s]  through the game and I jumped around in a circle a few times and I just returned it. All right,
[366.74s -> 375.51s]  let's go. It's time for Wadi. What's wrong with Yarn games? Nothing. I was just being like,
[375.51s -> 382.97s]  I'm just trying to be like, I haven't looked at my opinion. Oh, what's this? I can't do it like that.
[382.97s -> 390.49s]  I got to do it like this. No wonder I am flying. I am a fly. This is because I'm inside the game.
[391.05s -> 400.76s]  Ah, who cares? This is going to come. Hey, hey, hold on. Hey, let's walk out of here.
[400.76s -> 406.84s]  This video game maker loves treasure, money, and garlic. And money, what could go by? This is meat.
[406.84s -> 412.76s]  I'm kind of coming to the realization that me and Wario are on the same page.
[413.32s -> 425.91s]  This guy loves treasure. I love treasure. I love money. I love garlic. All right, Wario attacks in
[425.91s -> 443.00s]  whichever direction he's facing. Okay. It's like a dash. Move and attack. Break. Okay. Push. Push.
[443.00s -> 461.29s]  Jump. Wait, can I dash? I can only dash sideways? Yeah. Defeat. Okay, push. All right. Is this it?
[461.29s -> 465.46s]  Look, I'm not going to do the voice. I can't do the voice. I can't do any voices with a cam on.
[465.46s -> 472.54s]  You guys know that. Because look, I know how stupid and ridiculous I look with it on. But if it's off,
[472.62s -> 482.44s]  I turn the camera off. Now, all of a sudden, that's me, Wario. I can do Wario.
[482.44s -> 490.79s]  I'm not doing that with the camera on. It's like embarrassing to have you look at me do that.
[490.79s -> 496.90s]  Uh, this is the level I made. Oh, he made his own video game, right?
[497.54s -> 503.94s]  Okay. That thing and messed up everything it touched. I feel like I'm the voice actor
[503.94s -> 506.98s]  that replaced Wario and like I didn't care to do anything like the original.
[506.98s -> 524.18s]  This is bad. It's going to ruin my level. Wait. Oh, people would fucking freak up.
[524.18s -> 556.95s]  Cutscene. Oh my God. Just put a bag over your head. I do like the voices.
[558.39s -> 561.91s]  That actually might work. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. The games. I got to play the game.
[565.75s -> 568.47s]  I don't, I think I failed on the first level. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[568.47s -> 578.57s]  wait. That's a, that's a really good idea. Dislodge. I'm going to hide my head.
[579.85s -> 586.70s]  What a genius idea. Okay. Select all. I just punched the mic. All right. We're good.
[591.61s -> 602.49s]  I've been so long since I played this. I can't wait. Mr. Wario. That's what I just said.
[603.77s -> 612.76s]  Young cricket. This devoted student of the martial arts diligently trains under master Mantis.
[612.76s -> 621.08s]  He likes meat dumplings a lot. Jumping is cricket specialty. Hold down A to perform a high jump.
[622.28s -> 633.14s]  Okay. So everybody has like their own like powers. Push. How high can you go? You can jump really
[633.14s -> 641.54s]  high. Cool. Why are you in the game? I'm not. This is 18 volt. Check it. I'm here too.
[642.68s -> 645.96s]  Get this. I can throw this disc on my head as many times as I want.
[646.84s -> 650.98s]  I know what's even better. I don't have to move, but you don't move.
[654.57s -> 660.63s]  Okay. 18 volt throws his disc in whichever direction you tilt.
[663.10s -> 673.46s]  They can't move. Break them all. Okay. Oh shit. This is interesting. I feel like this is like
[673.46s -> 684.87s]  overpowered. This is completely overpowered. He said this art sucks. All right. People just
[684.87s -> 695.67s]  make it when they piss me off. I just fucking. He's fun. All right. So do I have to? All right.
[695.67s -> 703.16s]  Time to join forces is the only way. Come on. Let's tag team our foe. Oh shit. I switched like.
[705.18s -> 716.25s]  All right. Cool. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I got it. I'm a rise. You match it. Oh
[716.25s -> 737.18s]  shit. Like that. Okay. Yeah. What am I getting? I got them apparently. Oh shit. Okay. Got it.
[741.78s -> 747.88s]  Empty. This is weird. I switched between them. It freaks me out.
[749.16s -> 756.36s]  Tech. All right. When I got it, this game is insane. Does it get insane? I feel like it's
[756.36s -> 776.46s]  gonna be insane. All right. Boss stage. Let's go. I love that part. Oh, look. Golly.
[786.04s -> 796.95s]  Defeat. I don't have to. There's no timer here. I'm fine.
[810.97s -> 815.61s]  Holy shit. Are his spikes come out of his head? Oh my fucking idiot. What are you doing?
[826.41s -> 833.91s]  You lose to the first boss. I'm fine. Look, I'm just going to get in spring things. I've died.
[833.91s -> 839.00s]  This is different. This is different. This plays a lot differently than the other ones.
[839.64s -> 843.24s]  It's a complete evolution of the WarioWare formula.
[843.40s -> 866.04s]  Oh. Hi up. Hi up. It's a Nintendo game. It's three hits. All right. That was easy.
[868.57s -> 874.17s]  The emojis are fixed. I need to like, I need to put like a bag on my head and try to do voices.
[874.89s -> 880.70s]  That's really important. I need to like cover my head. If you guys can't see me,
[880.70s -> 889.70s]  I can do whatever I want. I can do voices. There you are. You can't hide from Wadi.
[891.83s -> 902.87s]  Whoa. The corruption is disappearing. I bet that was a game bug. They make games act all glitchy.
[902.87s -> 909.88s]  Do you turn the webcam off? Okay. Why did I read that? All right. So you got to get rid of all the
[909.88s -> 915.50s]  bugs in Wario's game. Sounds cool. Everything moved back to normal. Yeah. I'll do like the
[915.50s -> 921.77s]  best impressions you've heard all night. Let's smash some bugs. Frickin 18 volt. Join the crew.
[923.26s -> 932.46s]  You earned 1000 coins for completing a level. Oh, all right. Hold on. Give me one second. Let
[932.46s -> 936.14s]  me, I, I, well, I'll do this in a minute. Let me like get to the first like 20 minutes of the game.
[936.86s -> 947.78s]  You want to play your pedia. You're like missions through. All right. Nice. You sleep good last night.
[949.74s -> 959.70s]  Yep. The PNG of Wario over your webcam. No, not that's what. No. What year is this? Let's go level
[959.70s -> 967.75s]  two. I wonder if there's anything to begin to shake the Wemo. It'll load this place. The bugs
[967.75s -> 976.04s]  really did a number on it. Hey, hello Wario. Is that you? Oh, my scooter. It won't stop.
[978.09s -> 990.34s]  Wario Vtuber. You know that Charles Martinet did that 12 years ago. They set him up with a camera
[990.34s -> 996.10s]  that like recorded his face in real time and he would go to conventions and he did Vtuber Mario
[996.10s -> 1008.12s]  at conventions. That's like how it all started. The original Vtuber was Charles Martinet. The fart
[1008.12s -> 1016.31s]  music. It's Wario dude. That's not true and false. Look it up. All right. This is Mona. Work, school,
[1016.31s -> 1020.95s]  and pets keep this high school student busy. She's also a big fan of Wario. Why? Who can say?
[1020.95s -> 1026.94s]  Mona is always on the move so you have to steer her in the right direction. The boomerang
[1027.58s -> 1044.82s]  can be aimed the same way. You always are moving. I don't like this character. All right. This is
[1044.82s -> 1051.13s]  weird. Like I'm patting my head and rubbing my stomach at the same time. This is very weird.
[1051.13s -> 1060.34s]  This is strange. I get a raid. Oh, shit. Kit Boga raid. We got a Kit Boga raid this early.
[1060.34s -> 1070.50s]  What's going on? Thanks, Kit. What's going on? Welcome, everybody. Welcome to the stream. If
[1070.50s -> 1077.67s]  people are on my stream and you're not following Kit Boga by now, you've lost your goddamn mind.
[1077.67s -> 1081.27s]  Sing the raid song? No, I'm not going to sing a raid song. I'm going to do the impressions soon.
[1083.16s -> 1087.80s]  YouTuber raid voice. This is not a YouTuber raid voice. What are you talking about?
[1087.80s -> 1094.02s]  Look, when people hit the raid button, when you see the raid come in immediately,
[1096.34s -> 1103.10s]  I have to present myself in a way where I'm not a lunatic. Sing the raid song.
[1105.08s -> 1111.26s]  On almost just give 20 community subs. Thank you. Kit Boga is one of the funniest people on
[1111.26s -> 1118.49s]  Twitch. Go follow. How do you not know who this person is by now? They're on the dollhouse
[1118.49s -> 1130.65s]  stream. They've been got a thousand episodes. Thanks, Kit. Let's keep going. Find the bag for
[1130.65s -> 1139.66s]  your head. I will in a minute. I've been waiting for WarioWare for like the last fucking 25 years.
[1140.30s -> 1147.19s]  What a mess. My level looks awful. Bugs inside the game. Who did this? Unacceptable. Let's go.
[1148.07s -> 1154.54s]  Oh, wait, you actually pick your character. Oh, I don't want to be that. I don't want to be Mona.
[1154.54s -> 1157.26s]  I don't want to be that character. Who do I want to be? I think I'm going to be 18 volt.
[1160.38s -> 1172.52s]  Oh no, you pick your crew. I just, okay. I don't know. Why are you guys kind of hard? You can do
[1172.52s -> 1180.82s]  an auto. That's probably cheating, right? Here we go. You guys ready? Cut scene. Turn it off.
[1180.82s -> 1187.70s]  Remember, you look like a hotter version of Ryan Reynolds. Don't give me that. Don't stroke my
[1187.70s -> 1193.30s]  ego like that. That's completely false. That's 100% untrue. Why are you saying that? That's
[1193.30s -> 1210.78s]  unbelievably false. That's not even remotely accurate. See? If I had to do that with a cam on,
[1210.78s -> 1248.25s]  it's not going to happen. Next day. These people are just fucking up our house. All right, let's
[1248.25s -> 1262.81s]  do it. Peel. I just barely got it. All right. Aim and throw. Eight o'clock. Got it. Oh, look at
[1262.81s -> 1287.58s]  that. I love that little guy over there. Yeah. Ring. I get it. I got it, right? Ring the doorbell.
[1287.58s -> 1303.67s]  What? Hide. I rang the doorbell. Squeeze. He's so good. I just do it three times. Oh,
[1312.14s -> 1329.18s]  oh, that's hard. I got it. I got it. That's just one side. Okay. Good.
[1335.02s -> 1347.21s]  Thank God. Watch out for the teeth. Okay. I'm good. Yeah. I don't know why I thought I was
[1347.21s -> 1364.82s]  going to die. Oh shit. I got it. I didn't even know where I was. Good thing I was flying around.
[1370.66s -> 1386.98s]  Oh, this is, this is weird to do. Okay. Here we go. Air dryer. Mega Man jug. Boots. Backpack.
[1389.88s -> 1404.55s]  I need the Mega Man jug. I get it. Oh shit. I got time here. Missing backpack.
[1408.71s -> 1429.96s]  Bug. Oops. I tried to kill the bug. All right. I need two of these. I need two of these. I need
[1429.96s -> 1448.76s]  one of these and one of those. I want to kill this bug. I wouldn't even odd. Remember your hair looks
[1448.76s -> 1460.15s]  good today. Can I please see my family? I need like a bag. Not even a bag. Just like a, like a,
[1460.95s -> 1467.66s]  like a towel or something or like a blanket to hide. All tidied up. Good work everyone.
[1471.75s -> 1479.34s]  Thousand coins. All right. Hold on. Let me, I'll be right back. I'm not leaving. I just, I literally
[1479.34s -> 1585.91s]  just need one second. One second. Let's see. Let's test this. So if I was going to do Wario, right?
[1585.91s -> 1602.06s]  I don't like people looking at me. Hey, it's a me. Wario. I hate it. Hey, it's me. No, I don't like
[1602.06s -> 1614.54s]  people looking at me. Let's try this. Now you can't see me. So like I can do it. It's a me.
[1616.68s -> 1635.54s]  It's me. Wario. Oh, here I go. Here I go. That was pretty good until I freaked out.
[1637.53s -> 1644.50s]  How about Mr. Satan? I could do Mr. Satan too. It's me. No, I don't want to do it in front of you.
[1644.50s -> 1647.06s]  I'm going to do it. I'm going for it. Tell me which one's actually better.
[1647.46s -> 1653.34s]  Well, that's me, Mr. Satan. Hi, Goku.
[1653.34s -> 1657.26s]  Okay. Right. Now let's try this. Tell me which one's really actually better.
[1665.62s -> 1670.90s]  Well, that's how I do it, Goku. It's me, Mr. Satan. And I'm going to tell you something. You're not
[1670.90s -> 1679.18s]  going to destroy Earth until I kill you, Mr. Satan, Goku. It's constructing my blood vessels.
[1679.18s -> 1682.14s]  It's constructing my blood vessels a little bit. I can't do it that well.
[1682.70s -> 1686.63s]  All right. Here's the difference. It feels like somebody's like,
[1689.27s -> 1704.87s]  all right, do some voices. It's hard to do it with the mask on. The duck was,
[1704.87s -> 1719.10s]  was the duck better? That was just Alex Jones. Was the duck actually better? I don't think it
[1719.10s -> 1730.39s]  was because I was like constricted. All right. How about this? Ready? Now I'm not constricted.
[1733.16s -> 1739.64s]  Well, I'll tell you. It's me, Mr. Satan. And Goku has got himself in some trouble.
[1739.64s -> 1746.57s]  We got to go help him, Vegeta. Hey, it's me, Mr. Satan. We got to help that Goku out because
[1746.57s -> 1767.08s]  he's in big trouble. Which one was better? Okay. Exactly. Got him gained, please. Turn the camera
[1767.08s -> 1777.46s]  off. You know, that, why, why would I, why am I doing this? I'm not sure. Maybe you should try
[1777.46s -> 1788.07s]  the gimp mask again. Gimp mask. It's like a fucking turtle or whatever this thing is. It's,
[1788.07s -> 1792.15s]  I don't know what this is. It's like a duck or a chicken. What is this supposed to be?
[1793.19s -> 1806.47s]  What is this creature? What is this? Is it a chicken? It's a rubber ducky. Oh, right. Yeah.
[1807.91s -> 1827.35s]  It could be a turtle like this. All right. Stop pretending. All right. We've got all the weird
[1827.35s -> 1832.28s]  shit out of the way in this stream. We can go back to normal now. It's not so bad after all.
[1835.13s -> 1851.29s]  Oh, Wario. How could you say that? All right. Let's do it.
[1852.58s -> 1857.30s]  This taxi driving duo is happy to take you from your front door to the far reaches of space.
[1857.30s -> 1862.84s]  The fear is always fair. What's wrong with them today? I'm playing Wario Ware for the first time
[1862.84s -> 1871.42s]  in 10 years. I'm a little excitable. My Tribble always fires his bazooka to the right and Spitz
[1871.42s -> 1874.94s]  always fires to his left. What if I'm playing with one person?
[1878.63s -> 1893.35s]  I don't. How do I change? How do I switch person? I played this last year for the GameCube.
[1895.05s -> 1900.10s]  The game didn't come out last year for the GameCube. All right. We took a look around
[1900.10s -> 1906.87s]  and there are messes like this all over the place. Game bugs must have corrupted the entire game.
[1909.48s -> 1919.91s]  Let's go exterminate some bugs then. All right. I really like, I like 18 volt. I like cricket.
[1920.55s -> 1939.54s]  I think those are my two mains. Tribble and, oh. Did you forget you played smooth moves? Yeah,
[1939.54s -> 1944.26s]  but I, I played these games before. They came out 10 years ago. This is a new one that I've
[1944.26s -> 1970.20s]  never played before. I'm obviously going to be very excited. Here we go. Close. Holy shit. Okay.
[1970.20s -> 1980.23s]  Yeah. I didn't know if I had to shoot it. Spin it. Literally best character in the game.
[1981.03s -> 1999.21s]  Okay. Where the fuck am I? Made it. I got it, right? I can't even shoot that way. I got it.
[1999.21s -> 2011.27s]  Didn't I? Oh, I won. Okay. Cool. Put a jumpscare warning in the description when you're going to
[2011.27s -> 2038.60s]  turn on the webcam. Why is my webcam so dark? Oh, dodge. That's it. It's very easy.
[2042.54s -> 2047.75s]  How many? One, two, three, four, five, five. There are five. No, there are three. There are
[2047.75s -> 2078.46s]  two. There's one. Okay. High five. Oh shit. I'm going to lose. Stick together. Why am I going
[2078.46s -> 2085.29s]  like this? I'm like leaning back and free. Do you know what I'm doing? Like, why am I doing this?
[2085.29s -> 2093.22s]  Lean in. It's not like a scary horror game. Catch four. One, two, three, four. I'm an overachiever.
[2093.22s -> 2113.22s]  So, therefore, I get punished for it. I feel like it's going to be Wario and Cricket. All right.
[2113.22s -> 2134.33s]  Let's do it. Come on. Wario is actually pretty balanced. Oh, it's weird not being able to shoot
[2134.33s -> 2165.69s]  that way. Stop. This isn't Smash. I'm not playing Smash. I got it. Fight me in Smash. Okay.
[2180.87s -> 2202.98s]  Dodge. Oh, calm down. This game's easier to play standing up. I don't think so.
[2202.98s -> 2225.46s]  High five. Steal back. Steal back. Oh. Where the fuck was the raid song? This is difficult.
[2226.18s -> 2233.30s]  Okay, I got it. The raid song is from like 2019, guys. What do you want me to do? Oh shit. That's
[2233.30s -> 2255.35s]  bad. Catch four. One, two, three, four. It's from last year. It's from 2019. Protect. Protect this
[2255.35s -> 2274.38s]  little guy. Oh, what am I protecting? Unlock. Oh shit. Get it. You piece of shit. Let him go.
[2275.18s -> 2305.50s]  Unlock the fucking door. Get up there. Get up there. Oh my god. Let him go. That was tricky.
[2309.66s -> 2337.70s]  He only shot him 34 times. Ah, now that's more like it. What can I do with money? I have a full
[2337.70s -> 2357.27s]  drink here and I forgot it existed. Ah, that's good. Dr. Crygor? What's the drink? Um, it's tang.
[2358.15s -> 2371.18s]  I love tang. Am I swimming? Am I flying? Paddle, paddle, paddle. Look at my flippers go.
[2371.90s -> 2382.31s]  Hello, Dr. Crygor. Indeed, what the gallium is going on around here. Dr. Crygor, down here.
[2384.44s -> 2397.43s]  You literally live in the 90s. I don't. I have a tang over here. By the way, I do one
[2397.43s -> 2402.31s]  scoop. I don't do the recommended two or three tablespoons. I do one tablespoon just to get a
[2402.31s -> 2408.63s]  little flavor. I, it's barely anything in there. I just, I like it. It makes, it tastes good. It's
[2408.63s -> 2419.37s]  like a light little flavor. I don't recall my level looking like this at all. How many people
[2419.37s -> 2428.47s]  are in the game? Oh, you're here too. Extraordinary. Yeah, by the way, that shit will last like a year
[2428.47s -> 2434.63s]  if you do it like that. This genius scientist is so good at making mechanical marvels he made a
[2434.63s -> 2441.64s]  cyborg out of himself. Press or hold A to make Crygor swim through the air.
[2444.66s -> 2461.24s]  Weird, okay. So you just kind of steer around. Oh, yeah, this is weird. I don't hate it though.
[2461.80s -> 2475.43s]  By part of the game, something's gone awry. Do you know what it might be? Yes. Yes. Game bugs have
[2475.43s -> 2483.34s]  taken over. They're causing these glitches. Game bugs, glitches, wonderful. I shall be sure to
[2483.34s -> 2488.39s]  study them in my laboratory. I think this guy has some glitches of his own, if you know what I mean.
[2489.35s -> 2504.22s]  Okay, Wario and 18 volt. Let's begin. No, I'm not going to answer that question. It's weird.
[2504.78s -> 2575.42s]  Handball. Light. Oh, I like that one. That was fun. Are the emojis so large? I don't know what's
[2575.42s -> 2593.67s]  going on. Oh, I just get in frame. Escape. Oh, I escaped. No, you idiot. Fine, I got up.
[2594.15s -> 2608.71s]  Assemble. Assemble. Oh, Lord, I got it a little wrong, but I got it.
[2628.34s -> 2644.06s]  Shave your sides. Shave my sides. Like I haven't shaved in like a week. Oh, fuck. That was weird.
[2644.06s -> 2660.44s]  That's weird with him. I get it. I thought I was like, wait, am I going the wrong way?
[2663.40s -> 2685.94s]  Serve. I just spammed. I just, I smashed that fucking like button is what I did. What am I supposed to do?
[2688.12s -> 2702.52s]  Oh, that was easy. You contoured your beard. I didn't, I guess that's how my hair goes. I didn't
[2702.52s -> 2726.78s]  contour. That's funny though. Grab. Okay. Assemble. Another sushi. I almost picked up the
[2726.78s -> 2745.08s]  telephone. Okay. That was weird. It's toothpaste. It was very, that was simple. It's time for a full
[2745.08s -> 2749.48s]  melt downstream. I don't think so. I'm getting all the energy out in the beginning in the first like
[2749.48s -> 2754.62s]  40 minutes of the stream. I'm just blowing through all my energy like in an hour.
[2754.62s -> 2771.18s]  So don't worry. I'll go, I'll fall asleep in like 25 minutes. See, I am a genius. You earned a
[2771.18s -> 2782.12s]  thousand coins. Cool. All right. So I can only go here. Oh, Nintendo classics is my favorite stuff.
[2783.35s -> 2788.38s]  I love this shit. We're going to, we're going to get to see Super Mario 1. We're going to get,
[2788.38s -> 2794.78s]  hopefully we get to see Super Mario 2 and I hope we get to see Zelda and Metroid. This is the best
[2795.58s -> 2803.94s]  minigame. Waiting 10 years for these. All this pushing is good for my training, but can't you
[2803.94s -> 2824.28s]  just walk a little bit? Hell. Yikes. Nine volt. My skateboard. It's skating on its own. This
[2824.28s -> 2829.72s]  skateboarding school kid is obsessed with Nintendo games and has some serious DJing and yo-yo skills.
[2830.36s -> 2837.42s]  Nine volt skateboard keeps him rolling back and forth. Press A to stop and shoot his yo-yo
[2837.42s -> 2854.25s]  upwards. So you don't even move. It's just yo-yo. It's weird. I don't control it. This one's going
[2854.25s -> 2872.36s]  to be hard. Okay. I can turn around. Nine volt is the only person that can make Nintendo fan games
[2872.36s -> 2883.83s]  without getting a DMCA. That was, that was pretty good. That was pretty good. I like that one. What's
[2883.83s -> 2889.42s]  wrong with my level? Is it broken? Totally. There's these bugs in the game and they're chewing it all
[2889.42s -> 2898.47s]  up. Okay. Okay. And let's go get him. Nobody messes with my games. Nine volt. Okay. Nine volt,
[2898.47s -> 2920.70s]  18 volt. Let's take Dr. Kraigra. Why is he not doing silly voices? He missed the first 20 minutes
[2920.70s -> 2944.39s]  of the stream. That was pretty much the only thing we did. Nine volts house. I think augmented
[2944.39s -> 2978.81s]  reality game. I used to watch wrestling like that and I had this tiny little, I used to have
[2978.81s -> 2983.85s]  in my bedroom, this tiny little TV. It was like a, it was an old CRT TV. So it was big, right?
[2984.73s -> 2988.09s]  And I used to watch wrestling, like SmackDown would be, what am I doing?
[2990.81s -> 2994.89s]  Uh, so it was SmackDown and RAW. They would, it would be 10, 11, 12 o'clock.
[2995.05s -> 3001.85s]  And I would have to go to bed. But I had to, uh, I had to watch it on an old CRT TV. So I had plugged
[3001.85s -> 3005.85s]  it into bed. Like I plugged it into like the, oh, let me, let me pause this because my brain can only
[3005.85s -> 3010.81s]  do one thing at a time. So I had a little CRT TV. It was like a big queue. It was a big Minecraft
[3010.81s -> 3017.85s]  block. That's how I can describe it. So it's plugged in far away in my room. It's not right next to me.
[3017.85s -> 3021.45s]  But what I used to do is when I wanted to watch, watch wrestling late at night, I would plug the
[3021.45s -> 3026.97s]  TV in behind like the bed, like the outlet behind the bed. And the TV would be right on an end table
[3026.97s -> 3034.58s]  right next to the bed. Or I would be holding the TV in my bed, just like this with like fucking
[3034.58s -> 3040.90s]  Stone Cold Steve Austin on it and shit. And I would hear the like, here comes mom to check on you.
[3040.90s -> 3044.10s]  And there would be two things I would do it. I would like sometimes just like put it on the
[3044.10s -> 3050.26s]  fucking ground next to me and like pretend to be asleep or like put it under the covers and like,
[3050.26s -> 3056.07s]  go like this. But I had this gigantic like cube. Or I would try to turn with it like,
[3056.07s -> 3062.12s]  power off, turn it. It's like, I wonder how much my mother used to come in and be like,
[3062.12s -> 3068.36s]  you stop watching TV. I know what you're doing. The TV is normally like across the whole fucking
[3068.36s -> 3075.50s]  room. And you play, I'm like, no, I put it there before I went to bed. I turned it off at exactly
[3075.50s -> 3081.35s]  10 PM like I'm supposed to because I'm a good boy. It's like, oh no, you didn't. Did it ever work?
[3081.35s -> 3089.38s]  No, not once. I also, yeah, I think everybody that used to watch wrestling got in trouble
[3089.94s -> 3096.81s]  watching TV in bed. See, you don't know how lucky you motherfuckers have it now. Do you
[3096.81s -> 3104.12s]  understand me? Do you understand me? Do you know how hard it is? Do you know how easy it is for you
[3104.12s -> 3114.81s]  to go like this? It was a cube and it weighed 40 pounds and it was sitting on my chest. It was
[3114.81s -> 3122.60s]  over the neck. Do you understand how hard it was? You guys even have brightness settings.
[3122.60s -> 3126.60s]  You can go, oh, I'll turn the brightness down to zero so it makes like 10% illumination,
[3126.60s -> 3132.01s]  but I can still see. We didn't have that. You're lucky you didn't get your hands stuck in the VCR
[3132.01s -> 3159.10s]  part of these TVs. The combos. Game only? No! Okay, whatever. Sumers. Who won? Oh no, no, no,
[3159.18s -> 3165.56s]  you won. Wait, what happened? I am so confused. I just pick a side?
[3169.82s -> 3188.14s]  Oh, there's Donkey Kong. Mario? Remember, didn't have running water when he was a kid.
[3193.93s -> 3203.27s]  I'm just saying, you have, you have a TV, a game device. What am I doing? Oh wait, your phone is
[3203.27s -> 3222.07s]  everything. Yeah! I used to eat cement when he was a kid. I didn't eat cement. Spin it? Oh, that's so
[3222.07s -> 3243.94s]  hard with him. No! Spend a hundred coins to keep playing. What do you mean? No, yeah, what?
[3244.66s -> 3252.14s]  Oh, I can just start from there. No, start over. A hundred coins. No, I'm keeping it.
[3255.06s -> 3282.17s]  Eat cement. We used to play with old tires. We used to play with old, we used to play with old wood.
[3282.81s -> 3303.74s]  You guys don't understand. We actually had to use our tetanus shots, unlike you kids. You're
[3303.74s -> 3308.15s]  going to cut it off for the best part. Holy shit, that's one full letter grade below what I was
[3308.15s -> 3328.23s]  going to give it. I gotta be careful here. All right, what game is coming up next? This is Toad's
[3328.23s -> 3369.83s]  Treasure Trove. I remember that. I remember that one. The game is that one. Pikmin. I remember that
[3369.83s -> 3402.41s]  one. Hey! Oh. Which is greater. Three. What? This feels like a mod I don't want to be playing.
[3403.05s -> 3425.77s]  There's no jump. No! Wait. Okay. Ready? Go. Oh, do you like satisfying power washing video?
[3425.77s -> 3455.42s]  Oh, Newgrounds Mario Colonia. That was cool. I can't wait to do more of those.
[3455.50s -> 3478.94s]  It was a rant from what? What am I ranting about? Talk about KO. Thousand coins. Easy money.
[3481.59s -> 3493.11s]  And now what? New. This is, oh, it's a remix. First remix of the night.
[3496.70s -> 3502.15s]  Everybody just sat up in their seats. You've been waiting to eat your food because you know
[3502.15s -> 3505.27s]  that I'll be here for a little while. You're like, I'm waiting to get to the remix before I eat my
[3505.27s -> 3509.19s]  fucking chicken sandwich. I know he's going to be stuck here. I'm going to be laughing with my mouth
[3509.19s -> 3532.34s]  full of food. Minecart. Wait. Like the Donkey Kong minecarts? Be funny. Hurry up, my la la.
[3532.34s -> 3540.74s]  Be funny. My Burger King long chicken's getting cold. That's a funny joke. I know you're a liar
[3541.88s -> 3549.34s]  because they're always cold. Invented by Dr. Crygor, this karaoke robot has a great love
[3549.34s -> 3558.30s]  of singing. He does not have great skills at singing. Mike shoots notes upward from his mouth.
[3559.11s -> 3561.42s]  Can I fly around?
[3569.38s -> 3575.06s]  Oh, what a good observational comedy. I mean, I've had the long chicken like probably five times in
[3575.06s -> 3583.69s]  the last three or four years maybe. I'm not sure it's been warm once. It's very good. It's been
[3583.69s -> 3589.45s]  like kind of like sometimes lukewarm. I don't think I've had a hot long chicken in like five years.
[3590.09s -> 3597.11s]  I just don't think I have no memory of that. There's no such thing as a long chicken. Do
[3597.11s -> 3604.23s]  I have to link the video again? It's the Burger King long chicken. Just type it. Just type it
[3604.23s -> 3610.04s]  right now. Type in Burger King long chicken into Google. I want you to watch this. Look,
[3610.04s -> 3616.09s]  it's like the menu pops up. That's what it's called. They call it the Burger King original
[3616.09s -> 3624.33s]  chicken sandwich, right? Whatever it is. That's not what it's called. Long chicken. The original
[3624.33s -> 3631.22s]  BK chicken sandwich. That's like, all right. That's like when a company comes out with like
[3631.22s -> 3637.70s]  a cleaning solution and it's like a new, like, oh, new formula, original BK sandwich,
[3638.42s -> 3647.34s]  original formula. No, it's a fucking long chicken and I'll die on this hill. It's so, it's so like
[3647.34s -> 3654.84s]  just, oh, it's just like just safe. Like the original BK chicken sandwich. No, I don't want
[3654.84s -> 3661.66s]  to call it that. I'll take one long chicken, please. Oh, could I have a BK original chicken
[3661.66s -> 3680.50s]  sandwich? Yeah, there goes my solo career. We're going to play with Mike and I like 18 volts.
[3680.50s -> 3688.55s]  Nine volts. I don't like that. It's too hard to play. You just say chicken sandwich, weirdo.
[3688.55s -> 3693.35s]  Excuse me. I want that person timed up with one second. There are like seven different chicken
[3693.35s -> 3698.34s]  sandwiches at all these fast food restaurants now. The chicken sandwich is like the new thing. You
[3698.34s -> 3704.70s]  have to have like four of them or five of them. Oh, I'll take the deluxe chicken sandwich. I'll
[3704.70s -> 3709.34s]  take the crispy original chicken sandwich. Oh, could I have like the extra crispy double deluxe
[3709.34s -> 3714.86s]  chicken sandwich? McDonald's now has a, on the menu. I'm sorry, we're going to take a minute here.
[3716.14s -> 3720.54s]  It's, it used to be you would order like, oh, I'll take the chicken sandwich. Now there's like,
[3721.34s -> 3727.26s]  it's like, oh, number four. There's four A, four B, four C, and it's all a chicken sandwich.
[3731.64s -> 3735.77s]  Every restaurant has five different chicken sandwiches now. This one's spicy.
[3736.65s -> 3744.62s]  We're just going to have a fucking spicy chicken sandwich. I love these rants. It's not even a rant.
[3744.62s -> 3763.75s]  I'm just speaking factual information to you. Literally who cares? You're right. Stop.
[3765.11s -> 3782.60s]  This is a rant. Don't pretend it. No, it's really not. Oh my goodness. He's bad here.
[3792.95s -> 3800.31s]  Stream doesn't like choice. No, it's, it's about, look, you don't need a thousand menu items.
[3800.95s -> 3826.42s]  Make them good, not more. We did. No, I actually love like the late night menus because there's
[3826.42s -> 3854.57s]  like seven things on it. Can I do this? How am I supposed to? Okay. I got it right.
[3856.79s -> 3863.30s]  Nara has a mac and cheese sandwich. That's for you to say exactly what you just said for all
[3863.30s -> 3868.82s]  of us to be appalled by it. And then for somebody to go make a fucking like Instagram video about
[3868.82s -> 3882.44s]  it. Like that, that's what it's for. They've won because you just said that. Oh, I don't get
[3882.44s -> 3898.12s]  that one. Oh, this is impossible with this guy. Not possible. I died. All right. Okay. Let's go.
[3898.12s -> 3923.94s]  Focus. Oh, this is awesome. He's actually mad. Why would you think I'm mad right now?
[3924.66s -> 3949.00s]  There's no timer. Yeah, there is, but it's fine. I want all the coins because it probably gets
[3949.00s -> 3965.74s]  you something. Got all the coins. You're gonna be very prideful of your chicken sandwich knowledge.
[3967.56s -> 3983.64s]  Not really. And I'm kind of just foreshadowing over here, but why the fuck would it give you
[3983.64s -> 3993.16s]  something dumb ass? You're blatantly throwing. I just, I just beat it. What are you talking about,
[3993.16s -> 4029.67s]  man? Ooh, it's home to the island. This is Kat and Anna. Oh, this is Katana. Hey, we found you.
[4030.23s -> 4033.03s]  What's with all the bouncing? You look like a couple of tiny kangaroos.
[4034.07s -> 4041.59s]  We can't help it. Our legs won't stop jumping. It's probably just our super awesome ninja powers.
[4046.42s -> 4053.06s]  These kindergarteners are not only twins, they're ninjas too. That is a tiny bit older than Anna,
[4053.06s -> 4063.22s]  obviously. Kat and Anna jump non-stop. At always throws her shuriken to the right.
[4063.22s -> 4076.95s]  I don't like these constantly moving ones. Yeah, I don't like the constantly moving ones.
[4076.95s -> 4082.78s]  It's really weird jumping to our level. You can help us take it down if you're not too scared.
[4085.29s -> 4091.40s]  All right, let's pull out. Let's go Wario and we'll do, um, fine. I'll do nine volt.
[4092.28s -> 4100.73s]  Oh, there's another slot and cricket. That sounds good. We're not going to get a cut scene? Oh,
[4100.73s -> 4121.93s]  we are. This is the worst team. People just gave me shit by using the same three characters.
[4122.49s -> 4147.43s]  When are you going to play Mass Effect 2? The first one? I'm not going to play any of the mass
[4147.43s -> 4169.59s]  effects on the screen. Why not? I don't, I don't want to dedicate like a hundred hours to, never
[4169.59s -> 4178.04s]  mind. I'm going to get in trouble if I talk about this. Cover? Oh, this is a cat shit. Oh,
[4178.04s -> 4200.06s]  what the fuck? Speed. Come on. E1. That's classic. True The Flies Away. Classic WarioWare level.
[4206.62s -> 4229.02s]  What are your thoughts on? Well, hold on. First of all, we got a big chunk. Oh, no.
[4230.22s -> 4248.04s]  You didn't eat it all. Somebody wrote shut the fuck up. But it was in all capitals and they
[4248.04s -> 4280.02s]  misspelled up. It was so angry at that one. I was right at the wire. Is it? I got it right.
[4286.98s -> 4297.51s]  Ease. Okay. This is like a, this one's a lot of poop. That one's not hard. All right. Boss
[4297.51s -> 4307.16s]  battle. Are you going to be a dedicated Mass Effect 3 streamer? I cannot think of something
[4307.16s -> 4319.77s]  that seems more torturing to do than you want me to play Mass Effect 3 every stream. I mean,
[4319.77s -> 4326.98s]  how many times can you truly play through that game? Am I supposed to do something?
[4327.06s -> 4334.97s]  Question one. No. Who was there the most of? I don't, I don't know. I think it was the Flamingo.
[4338.98s -> 4342.42s]  Okay. If you're like speed running Mass Effect, then sure. You're going to do that.
[4343.06s -> 4354.31s]  Who was not there? He wasn't here. Just to simply be, I'm a Mass Effect 3 streamer. Question three.
[4354.31s -> 4361.18s]  No speed runs. No like new DLC or anything. Who was in pair? I don't know. I think it was this guy.
[4361.90s -> 4369.50s]  No. What are you doing? There are multiple endings. I could see like streaming Mass Effect 3 for like
[4369.50s -> 4374.14s]  a couple of weeks or something with like 100% of the game, right? But if I did Mass Effect 3
[4374.14s -> 4383.54s]  every day for like five years, I expect three, but I wasn't speed running it. Okay. We have Lion with
[4383.54s -> 4401.34s]  Meat, Jumping Elephant, and Sleeping Gorilla. Question one. Who was not there? No, there was
[4401.34s -> 4415.35s]  no, there was no giraffe. Stop looking at chat. Leave me alone. Question two. Who had food? Lion.
[4415.91s -> 4443.64s]  Question three. Who was jumping? Elephant. I won. Please. I said Mass Effect 3 multiplayer,
[4443.64s -> 4465.66s]  not the regular game. I misunderstood. We did it. Mission complete. I wonder what you actually buy
[4465.66s -> 4476.71s]  weapons. What do you spend money on? Oh, their names are Kat and Anna like Katana. Yeah. It helps.
[4476.71s -> 4490.92s]  They say it in the other game. Sports. Jimmy T. What's with this place? It's so dark and boring.
[4494.10s -> 4509.29s]  It's rather spoopy. Are you holding your little Joy-Cons? Thanks. Okay. Here we go. Sports. Hello.
[4509.29s -> 4521.77s]  Is anyone there? Grief. Why is there a story in the WarioWare game? There was a story in the other
[4521.77s -> 4535.26s]  ones. It was a storyline. All right, Jimmy. What do you got? Jimmy T. Whether he's hitting the dance
[4535.26s -> 4544.78s]  floor or the gym, the sports loving disco king has all the right moves. Okay. Tilt to choose the
[4544.78s -> 4555.54s]  direction of Jimmy's attack. This is kind of like Wario. This is Wario, but you can go in any
[4555.54s -> 4570.34s]  direction. Upgraded Wario. Why would I use Wario? We can fix it, but we got to take care of those
[4570.34s -> 4586.95s]  bugs. All right. I'm not going to pick Wario. Mike was good and I'll do Mona too. Why not?
[4588.07s -> 4589.91s]  And Dr. Crygor because I like them.
[4592.98s -> 4602.44s]  There's the cam. I turned the camera off for cutscenes so I get out of the way so you can pay
[4602.44s -> 4632.46s]  attention. This seems important. All right. There's something stuck in the fax machine.
[4633.10s -> 4636.06s]  There's something stuck in the fax machine.
[4638.54s -> 4656.57s]  It really is. That's just, it's Milton right there. It's the same outfit.
[4664.89s -> 4701.32s]  Hey, DJ. All right. Boomerang. Land. That was not easy. What the fuck?
[4711.02s -> 4714.30s]  Oh, he's to get it. You got it. Okay. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it.
[4714.30s -> 4728.15s]  Wrong direction, Andy. Uh, whatever. Nice. Reel it in.
[4745.66s -> 4748.78s]  Wow. Okay. I didn't, I didn't understand what was going on to the last second.
[4749.50s -> 4773.91s]  Shoot it. Oh God. Okay. Speed up. Number 10. Oh God. He was perfect for that. Audios. De-synced.
[4774.55s -> 4808.23s]  Which one? It's not de-synced. Let's do a test. Ready? Climb. Oh goodness.
[4812.15s -> 4842.66s]  Are his feet above his head? How is he doing that? Fuck this art. This is going to be awful
[4842.66s -> 4850.98s]  when it gets to an actual remix. That's hard. And that shows up and I have to do that in like
[4850.98s -> 4872.22s]  12 seconds. I'm going to lose every time. It's a boss level, not a normal level.
[4873.96s -> 4881.48s]  They get harder though. Can you, don't you go back and do that? I think you can,
[4881.48s -> 4884.20s]  you go back and you play these things again and they're like three times harder.
[4885.16s -> 4898.65s]  All right. Here's Ashley. This is the Ashley. We're going to get a song.
[4899.29s -> 4919.24s]  That's uh, let's just uh, but, but, but let's see. Kamehameha. What's it? Kameha. What's the
[4919.24s -> 4932.38s]  character's name? It's from Mario. The character from Mario, the wizard that has like the same
[4932.38s -> 4945.11s]  exact wand and the cubes. What's the character's name? Kamak. Yeah. That's a pretty cool reference.
[4950.25s -> 4955.69s]  Ashley. Ashley. Cute stuff. Doesn't like cute stuff. Expressing emotions. Unnecessary chit chat.
[4955.69s -> 4963.62s]  Likes casting spells. Food in her pal red. Ashley cast spells in whichever direction she's facing.
[4974.90s -> 4981.98s]  Again, just a better version of Mike. This is a better version of Mike.
[4981.98s -> 4988.04s]  Mike just shoots up and just stomps some game bugs and you, you're going to help us.
[4989.46s -> 4999.32s]  Why should I? Because I said so and because fine, we don't need you anyway. Of course you do. Of
[4999.32s -> 5032.30s]  course, my buddy. And we'll do dribble and spits because they're awful. Here we go. Here it comes.
[5033.02s -> 5045.08s]  She likes to eat her food and she has all kinds of moods. Her name is Ashley. You cast a spell on
[5045.72s -> 5094.41s]  you. Where is it? It didn't do what I said. Embarrassing yourself, Jeremy.
[5100.97s -> 5118.76s]  Holy. Okay. You got to get it. It's a thing that way a lot. Get out. Oh, get the ball out. Shit. I
[5118.76s -> 5146.89s]  got it. Get it in there. Oh, blend it up. I like that one. That's my favorite one I think so far.
[5146.89s -> 5174.30s]  That's my favorite minigame for the whole day. Oh shit. Tang. I didn't even pick up on that.
[5175.02s -> 5187.70s]  It was very easy. I can't protect with. Oh yeah.
[5187.70s -> 5195.83s]  I can.
[5199.43s -> 5210.73s]  All right, time for a boss battle. Oh, you're playing a kid's game.
[5212.97s -> 5225.21s]  Okay. Would you like me to stop? Should I stop playing? Juice. Juice. Don't spill. Oh,
[5225.85s -> 5241.64s]  I don't understand. I need to fill each one of these slots? Oh, I need to juice it. I actually
[5241.64s -> 5267.21s]  physically smash it. Okay. Why is that meter doing that? Oh, that's. I'm fine. That was easy.
[5272.74s -> 5282.39s]  Everybody's a kid at heart. Before you retire, Jeremy, please do a full beard.
[5283.61s -> 5294.42s]  I can't. It just looks like I have like wires hanging out of my face. The hairs are so
[5294.42s -> 5301.72s]  individually spaced out that it just looks strange. After another two weeks of this,
[5302.28s -> 5314.49s]  it looks bizarre. All right. I got 10 almost 10,000 bucks. Orbulon.
[5317.43s -> 5329.02s]  Strange beards are cool. I mean, maybe. I don't like the way it looks. What's that weird sound?
[5329.82s -> 5333.94s]  Yeah. Some people can pull off beards. Some people can just pull off like a strange looking beard.
[5334.58s -> 5351.59s]  I'm not one of them. Plus it's itchy and annoying. I hate it. I don't like the way a beard feels.
[5351.59s -> 5356.74s]  Let's try to turn the camera off. This alien insists he'll invade Earth one day.
[5356.74s -> 5363.35s]  He's lived here long enough to know a lot about our culture. Orbulon sucks up the things below
[5363.35s -> 5378.81s]  him by activating his beam. Okay, weird. Beam up. Whoa. I like this character a lot.
[5382.28s -> 5388.20s]  My beam of tractoring, it does not work on this glitchy yuck. Stuff won't go away until we take
[5388.20s -> 5398.06s]  out those mean old game bugs. See, then Orbulon will dispose of these bugs with style. We're
[5398.06s -> 5411.58s]  doing Ashley and Ashley, Jimmy. I did a mustache for the one stream and I couldn't do it again.
[5412.30s -> 5436.57s]  I already like this music the most. When are you going to play Mass Effect 3
[5436.57s -> 5447.13s]  Alternate Appearance Pack DLC 1? What a living hell. That's so stupid.
[5454.87s -> 5458.71s]  That would be my stream title too. Checking out the huge new update.
[5463.02s -> 5475.27s]  Commander Shepard has a green shirt this time. The developer studio t-shirt. Make it flow.
[5476.23s -> 5481.86s]  Commander Shepard with like the game studio t-shirt that you can put on.
[5481.94s -> 5489.10s]  I would lose my fucking mind. Match? I don't know what happened.
[5492.79s -> 5503.45s]  I can't even stream the same game like two or three times. It was a Christmas miracle
[5504.25s -> 5509.53s]  that I was able to stream and play and make videos of TF2 for as long as I did.
[5510.17s -> 5521.34s]  That's the only exception ever. Ice cream. Oh shit. Was there a spoon in it? No.
[5525.72s -> 5538.22s]  It just got burnt. What happened? Oh, whatever. I didn't get it for a second but now I do.
[5546.74s -> 5569.78s]  Ring the bell. Ring the bell. What the fuck? Oh, do it. God. What the fuck?
[5569.78s -> 5602.41s]  I love these ones. Come on. Get over there. I love when you mix the colors together.
[5604.65s -> 5609.59s]  Don't waste your money. What's the point? This team might not be very good either.
[5610.39s -> 5642.90s]  Shit. Okay. I got it. You're a sad little man. All right. Nice. I got it.
[5662.95s -> 5665.83s]  I'm going to steal your bread if you don't tell me your skin care routine.
[5667.35s -> 5675.58s]  Okay. It's called turn the shower on. Put your shampoo in your head and then go like this.
[5678.79s -> 5698.12s]  And like get it all over like everywhere. Make sure your eyes are closed. Your mouth is closed.
[5698.12s -> 5702.98s]  Oh, this one sucks. Okay. I got it. You just shampoo, shampoo, shampoo. Then you go after
[5702.98s -> 5708.34s]  the shampoo runs dry, right? When it runs out and it runs clear. Just hold your face up to the...
[5712.10s -> 5718.50s]  Hold your face up to the shower and just go like this. He distracted me and it caused a
[5718.50s -> 5737.21s]  problem. Do it. No, you just use like seed fill. You're fine. I'm kidding. Just use like a little
[5737.21s -> 5756.49s]  gentle cleanser like seed fill. That's all you have to do. 35 in one shampoo. 35 in one shampoo
[5756.49s -> 5760.81s]  would be you brush your teeth too. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. We got to talk about that.
[5760.81s -> 5769.46s]  Let him pass. Come on in. Imagine putting shampoo in your hair, letting it run down into your mouth
[5769.46s -> 5777.06s]  and brushing your teeth with it. And then it keeps going down and you put it under your armpits and
[5777.06s -> 5794.49s]  it's a deodorant. Let's kill somebody. What happened? What was that? Let him through. Let it pass.
[5811.74s -> 5834.60s]  Oh, okay. I get it. They were going to crash into each other. I got something in my nose.
[5836.20s -> 5851.72s]  Oh my god. There's like an animal in here. What do I do? But they're going to crash into each other.
[5852.44s -> 5868.78s]  It's like, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out. Why would it tell? Why would it
[5868.78s -> 5878.18s]  tell me that? There is a beam that's like caution, caution, caution, oncoming car, caution, caution,
[5878.18s -> 5892.71s]  caution. Why is there a caution? If I'm driving on one side of the road, I don't get a bunch of
[5892.71s -> 5902.33s]  caution signs. Let's say, watch out, another car is on the other side of the road. What's the caution
[5902.33s -> 5959.86s]  for? Get out of here. Get away from it. Last one. I'm not going to watch it. Get the animal out of
[5959.86s -> 5979.43s]  your nose. I will eventually. Go pee break? Yeah, I will in like 15 minutes. At the two-hour mark,
[5979.43s -> 5989.70s]  we'll do a first break. I'm fine. Conquer the game, bugs, then conquer the world. Thank you Segata
[5989.70s -> 5993.22s]  for the 10 community subs. I missed a bunch of other subs too. We were in the middle of ranting,
[5993.70s -> 6001.02s]  ranting and raving. But thanks. Thanks for the subs. Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[6002.22s -> 6017.94s]  I believe this is remix two. Two hours drink. I've got, I've got a drink right here. I'm good.
[6018.66s -> 6029.11s]  This is full of water and a little bit of tang. I'm hydrating. I'm good. Another mine cart. I'm
[6029.11s -> 6035.66s]  going to take Orbilion. I like them. Do you like the game so far? I do, but so far it's very easy.
[6037.30s -> 6040.66s]  I think I'm going to eat those words, but it's very simple so far. Very easy.
[6041.22s -> 6044.26s]  I'm really hoping that it gets much more challenging in the near future.
[6045.22s -> 6059.45s]  I remember smooth moves. Some of those remixes were insane. Yeah, I think it's going to be hard.
[6059.45s -> 6067.53s]  I know it is. Unacceptable. You know better than to wander off by yourself. It's not safe.
[6068.33s -> 6077.11s]  Oh my, getting upset makes me so sleepy. Like what's up with your mom and your other mom?
[6077.91s -> 6084.20s]  You have these out of body experiences, I guess. Your mom's got spooky moves. Hey, that's weird.
[6084.20s -> 6096.38s]  I dig it. Five volt. While there's nine volt, she's as sweet as can be until she gets mad.
[6096.38s -> 6103.64s]  Her out of body anger is positively shocking. Five volt warps to wherever her spirit takes her
[6103.64s -> 6118.15s]  and emits a powerful shock. She can't warp to certain areas. Okay, weird. Yeah, I think I'll
[6118.15s -> 6128.79s]  get used to it and then I'll probably end up liking it. We'll see. She can't move. There's
[6128.79s -> 6135.46s]  no jump or anything. Just teleport. All right, we're going to get the cutscene here.
[6138.52s -> 6142.30s]  I want to just use the overpowered characters. Let's go with Mike and Wario
[6143.10s -> 6152.58s]  and 18 volt. You can't just use the OP characters every time. Oh shit, there's no cutscene.
[6153.46s -> 6190.01s]  No cutscene. Did I fuck it up? I think I broke it. I got it. She's actually pretty good. Does that
[6190.01s -> 6200.60s]  count? How do you jump through when you have a teleport? What? I can't, there's no jump through.
[6210.58s -> 6224.06s]  I like not having to move. Shit, too much. Okay, we're good.
[6230.63s -> 6269.27s]  Why do I sound like Patrick? I sound like Patrick. All right, speed up. Oh, she's weird.
[6269.27s -> 6281.46s]  She's weird to use. It does sound like Patrick.
[6297.08s -> 6308.34s]  I'm a master. All right, here we go. What's her boss? I'm not more of this juicing, juicing
[6308.34s -> 6319.62s]  shit. I can't even talk. I don't want to do the juicing. This actually kind of sucks with her.
[6325.54s -> 6347.58s]  Jump with the B. I'm missing a lot. No. Oh, we're at critical levels. The shit's moving around.
[6348.46s -> 6371.75s]  And that's it, right? That's hard with her. It's weird. All right, come on. Let's go. Let's go.
[6378.92s -> 6395.40s]  I think I figured out the strat though. Yeah, I got it. He's gonna wait till there's two over.
[6395.40s -> 6437.78s]  Don't. Stop. No. Fuck. No. No. God damn it. My last try. Last attempt. I just watched your
[6437.78s -> 6444.41s]  Thanksgiving dinner stream. This was a while ago. That's like one of my favorite streams.
[6445.74s -> 6451.99s]  That polarized the community so much. That's some people's least favorite thing I've ever done and
[6451.99s -> 6458.65s]  some people's most favorite thing I've ever done. People genuinely hated that stream and they were
[6458.65s -> 6474.15s]  like, don't fucking do that shit. I hated it. It's like, all right, I would do it again too.
[6474.95s -> 6490.98s]  It's my last chance. Seriously. I got stung by the B. What? I didn't think that was even possible.
[6491.62s -> 6494.49s]  I'm spending 100 fucking coin packs and I'm going again.
[6529.72s -> 6557.82s]  Pop it. I'm not gonna scream. What am I fucking 10? Pop. That's it. Okay, game over. I win.
[6567.98s -> 6587.64s]  No, the meter is going so high. Game too hard? Game is not too hard. You haven't seen hard yet.
[6589.85s -> 6601.08s]  That's coming up pretty soon. How many more characters are they going to introduce in the
[6601.08s -> 6615.35s]  game? Let me see. Go back and play the old levels. I'm curious. Let's see. So if I go back to, let's say,
[6616.71s -> 6640.02s]  all right, like Dr. Crygore, right? What happens? Yeah, I've already seen this. So what happens if
[6640.02s -> 6665.88s]  I play this again? After this, you should play one of the other, make a match. Oh shit. Can I
[6665.88s -> 6672.38s]  grow back? What does it play? Rhythm Heaven. I played it. It's one of my favorite games. Look,
[6672.38s -> 6701.13s]  green, green, purple. Pop on. Huh? I was paying attention. All right, I'm good. I got to get at
[6701.13s -> 6728.34s]  least 20 to 30 on every level. I like that video. Heart to Zombe, that one. What? I thought it was
[6728.34s -> 6747.90s]  a spade. Wasn't it a spade? I'm confused. 11. I got to get to at least level 20 to 30 to 50.
[6766.71s -> 6780.81s]  Green? A pop-up ad? What was that? Oh, I'm at the boss stage. What the heck? Do we keep going
[6780.81s -> 6807.11s]  after this? This game looks fun. It is fun. Itchy. I think we keep going after this. Okay,
[6807.11s -> 6825.40s]  so does it keep going? Yep, it does. Bonus stage. Uh, wait. I haven't thought. Oh, it's just a
[6825.40s -> 6863.11s]  collect game? No, we keep going. That's right. I knew it. What did it explode? What did it explode
[6863.11s -> 6870.07s]  for? I lost. Now I'm paying some fucking in-game currency. I'm paying in-game currency. Oh, I can't.
[6874.01s -> 6890.90s]  All right, I'll go back to it. Wario. Now we're getting somewhere. This is the last level I made.
[6891.70s -> 6896.71s]  This is story mode, guys. There's like a ton of shit to do. There's much corruption here,
[6896.71s -> 6914.94s]  a great amount of much. What is that thing? It's taking over my game. We've got to stop it.
[6916.86s -> 6920.14s]  It's four more characters. Yeah, what are you guys doing? This is just like the little story mode.
[6920.14s -> 6930.07s]  They get you tutorial to get you going. All right, it's five people. Bobulon, Mike, Ashley,
[6931.03s -> 6981.70s]  18 volt and five volt for the wild card. He's like possessed. That's kind of scary.
[6995.08s -> 7020.98s]  Credit card. Where's the key? All right. What? What's happening? What the fuck? I had to pull it.
[7020.98s -> 7029.32s]  I was trying to pull the damn thing. This is an awful character to have. This character is not
[7029.32s -> 7041.43s]  good. That was a very bad character. Three, one, four. Is murder legal in the Mario universe?
[7055.40s -> 7107.29s]  Okay, I got it. I lost. My mouth keeps going like, she's good. She's really good, actually.
[7107.29s -> 7139.85s]  That's really good. Oh, all right. Get this out of here. This guy sucks. I can get rid of him.
[7139.85s -> 7152.62s]  The one thing he was good for is right there. Oh, fuck.
[7166.78s -> 7180.79s]  There we go. Which one travels in the ocean?
[7185.38s -> 7194.06s]  It's too much for my brain. No, I don't want this guy for the boss stage. Maybe I do.
[7196.41s -> 7245.72s]  Chase. What? What happened? Go. What? Oh, it's on a rock they can break. Can I do it?
[7260.34s -> 7270.41s]  Oh, I hate this guy. All right. There we go. Okay. All right. Finally.
[7271.13s -> 7282.82s]  It's going to be so much easier with this character. It's so much better.
[7283.38s -> 7289.72s]  This is simple. I can literally just go to the edge of the screen and press A.
[7297.88s -> 7310.70s]  Okay. That was much easier. Here we go. Just dodge it. Just watch out for the rocks.
[7315.72s -> 7334.18s]  Wind. Be careful. Capture. No, I don't want this guy right now.
[7337.86s -> 7348.46s]  Chase. It's just capture and then points at the thing. I thought I had to catch the damn thing.
[7349.02s -> 7407.35s]  I don't have to destroy them. I hate this. Let's go. Okay. Capture. Oh, that's it?
[7407.99s -> 7443.08s]  That's such a bait. I like the toilet character though. That was cool. Wario. Anything goes.
[7443.80s -> 7451.56s]  I just beat the tutorial. This is where it gets a little bit more tricky.
[7457.27s -> 7468.36s]  I have to get at least 25 on most of the levels of my choosing. By most, I mean three. And by three,
[7468.36s -> 7480.63s]  I mean one. And by one, I mean I'll see you tomorrow. I need to get at least 25 on the remixes.
[7480.71s -> 7502.98s]  At least 50 on one remix. I gotta get at least 50 on one remix. I am the supreme developer.
[7504.30s -> 7508.95s]  I watch over this game, you might say. I'm the one who brought you here. Yes, that was all me.
[7509.67s -> 7513.91s]  I'm supreme who? Come on. Everyone knows Wario's number one.
[7515.99s -> 7522.15s]  The game bugs arrived quite uninvited. Almost as uninvited as your parent doing Wario reading a
[7522.15s -> 7527.29s]  book with Wario in it to their three-year-old son or daughter. They knew not what to do,
[7527.29s -> 7533.24s]  so I brought you here to help. Thank you for tidying up their mess. Difficult work,
[7533.24s -> 7547.21s]  I'm sure. Now your home is right this way. I'm gonna shuffle on out of here. Come back and play
[7547.21s -> 7559.06s]  anytime. That's it. Oh, here's the ending cutscene. I'm not done. I'm not done. I want to get at least
[7559.06s -> 7566.76s]  like 30 or 40 or 50 on some of these. I want to dial it up. I want to get intense. That was the
[7566.76s -> 7600.28s]  tutorial. We make games, I make money. Wario programs with java script.
[7606.76s -> 7624.02s]  Someone's missing. Who's missing? Oh no. We must rescue them.
[7632.55s -> 7641.37s]  Not over. This was just the beginning. All right, thousand coins. Very cool.
[7644.81s -> 7648.97s]  You now can walk to the end anytime. You unlocked a variety pack in the main menu.
[7650.68s -> 7669.06s]  All right. New. Scary mode. Looks like it. All mixed up. All right, I'm gonna do this one and
[7669.06s -> 7680.06s]  then I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'm gonna blow my nose. You've returned and so soon welcome.
[7680.70s -> 7687.03s]  Seems some of our friends are still stuck inside the game. Three of our friends, you gotta help us.
[7687.83s -> 7693.75s]  Yes, of course. I shall check. Yes, strange. It appears they have been captured by something.
[7695.67s -> 7699.83s]  Oh, come on. I thought we took care of the game bugs. This is not the word of a game bug. Wait,
[7699.83s -> 7705.40s]  oh dear. One of you friends is nearby. All right, something tells me they're in this tower.
[7713.24s -> 7722.09s]  Someone, anyone help? Red, what have you done now? Actually, I knew you'd come to rescue a little
[7722.09s -> 7730.22s]  old me. Red, sometimes he seems to be more scaredy cat than demon. Still, Red takes good care of his
[7730.22s -> 7745.06s]  fave witch Ashley. Have bombs? That's a little weird. I kind of like it though. There's a delay.
[7745.78s -> 7755.27s]  There's a delay on them. Cool. Okay. You see where this big thing went.
[7756.15s -> 7765.51s]  Pretty sure it took this elevator up to floor 18. Do we have this more people to unlock? All right.
[7766.62s -> 7789.30s]  Obi-Lan, Mike, Ashleigh, okay. Let's go. We're himself not scared. Simple with this guy.
[7793.82s -> 7811.96s]  Oh, get out of the way. I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it,
[7812.52s -> 7814.28s]  I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it,
[7814.28s -> 7817.84s]  I don't get it. Oh, you know what? That was embarrassing. Oh
[7819.28s -> 7823.48s]  It's very embarrassing if I had to connect to the left side. I thought I had to connect it to the left side
[7824.12s -> 7826.12s]  It was embarrassing. It's fine. Take a peek
[7827.12s -> 7837.76s]  We got away frog walk. I love that guy. Why can't that be a warrior wear character? Oh
[7848.26s -> 7850.42s]  Was that technically a goal I don't think so
[7851.22s -> 7864.99s]  No get under the tongue get under the tongue
[7865.87s -> 7869.39s]  These are hard. It's uh, oh
[7872.53s -> 7874.53s]  I'm fine. This is gonna be hard
[7880.12s -> 7889.53s]  Cool car. Give me a fucking break
[7908.07s -> 7909.59s]  Five
[7909.59s -> 7912.75s]  I'm so proud of that. Five. I know that
[7913.79s -> 7936.66s]  That is it. Did I do it? I did it. All right time to pee
[7939.22s -> 7947.41s]  Don't pee right after this cutscene. What the heck that thing jumped out the window from floor 18
[7948.45s -> 7952.48s]  Drop something what's in there olden beehive
[7954.00s -> 7957.60s]  Treasure all right. We must not lose focus. I forgot I still had that emote
[7958.16s -> 7962.24s]  We must not lose focus time to rescue the other two
[7963.04s -> 7968.19s]  All right, I gotta be
[7968.19s -> 7969.71s]  I'll be right back
[7969.71s -> 8114.98s]  See you in a second. Okay. Hello
[8115.30s -> 8118.43s]  I'm trying to come back a little quieter nowadays
[8118.91s -> 8121.73s]  Is the compressor on my mic when I come back?
[8122.13s -> 8125.71s]  I'm just loud here. I am I feel like I scared the shit out of people
[8134.80s -> 8136.80s]  All right, we got a super hard
[8137.44s -> 8141.79s]  Super hard, I feel like this is gonna get impossible, but whatever
[8143.94s -> 8160.51s]  I'm doing a lot of like dancing today and like moving around. I feel like I have to do that when I play these games
[8161.23s -> 8163.95s]  whenever I have the two joy cons in both hands like this
[8164.75s -> 8167.47s]  I need to like be like
[8167.47s -> 8169.15s]  like moving
[8169.15s -> 8171.15s]  Because I feel like I'm not connected
[8172.00s -> 8173.52s]  This keeps me
[8173.52s -> 8175.04s]  like sane
[8175.04s -> 8176.80s]  Having to go like this
[8176.80s -> 8178.64s]  When you let me go like this
[8178.72s -> 8183.20s]  I'm just like I can move around I can do anything I want I I need to be like held down like this
[8184.83s -> 8186.59s]  Look at him. Look at him go
[8186.59s -> 8189.02s]  I'm tired of waiting and fell asleep
[8194.21s -> 8197.41s]  What do you got?
[8197.41s -> 8201.81s]  Uh mantis is a master jumper. He's so good. He can jump onto the ceiling and walk around up there
[8201.81s -> 8203.81s]  That's gonna be I don't want to use this guy
[8204.05s -> 8217.80s]  He's weird
[8217.80s -> 8222.06s]  Untethered
[8222.06s -> 8224.62s]  All right, super hard. Let's go. What how many do I need 18?
[8226.13s -> 8230.22s]  Or 10 that's it
[8230.38s -> 8232.38s]  only floor 10
[8237.66s -> 8249.81s]  It seems like it's gonna be simple. Nope. It's fast, but I wanted to 10
[8250.69s -> 8263.18s]  I can definitely get 30 or 40 at least on one of these
[8270.34s -> 8274.24s]  Oh take it out
[8279.90s -> 8281.90s]  Oh, okay seeks shelter

[8299.30s -> 8313.55s]  See I have the reverse problem when I play games
[8313.71s -> 8314.03s]  Okay
[8314.03s -> 8317.79s]  Instead of voice impressions if the camera's off I can do voice is better, right?
[8318.35s -> 8323.23s]  But when the camera's on I have this like obligation to overact. You know what I mean? Like
[8323.95s -> 8325.95s]  I don't do that when the camera's off
[8326.59s -> 8328.75s]  Like oh something crazy just happened. Whoa
[8329.47s -> 8330.75s]  Whoa
[8330.75s -> 8333.15s]  Stop, why am I doing that? I don't do that in real life

[8338.96s -> 8340.96s]  Okay toilet paper roll
[8341.76s -> 8348.54s]  Although actually some of it's real actually most of it's real

[8383.31s -> 8384.91s]  Fuck whoa
[8384.91s -> 8388.51s]  And I have to go harder because I like oh, that's not good enough. I gotta go harder than that
[8391.92s -> 8403.70s]  Real right block that part of the preview
[8404.62s -> 8406.70s]  It's so small. I can't even like see it

[8424.85s -> 8426.85s]  I can't help it. I just like oh what if what I would look like today

[8454.32s -> 8460.08s]  the narcissist in the pond
[8460.16s -> 8463.92s]  What's the narcissist in the pond? Is that like a story?

[15429.08s -> 15441.12s]  Oh, no, I didn't I changed the wrong one. There you go. Now that's better. Sorry about that. Sorry about that
[15443.64s -> 15450.56s]  At least like level 50 i'm not gonna get 50, but you know, okay
[15460.32s -> 15468.68s]  Still bad. What that should be good
[15470.15s -> 15477.01s]  I I didn't change this did I? That should be fixed
[15481.48s -> 15488.00s]  Okay, but I let me just restart
[15489.04s -> 15492.76s]  Go back to rocking
[15496.42s -> 15498.50s]  So tomorrow i'm not ending the stream don't worry
[15499.06s -> 15501.06s]  Uh tomorrow we're gonna finish normal heroes three
[15501.78s -> 15506.64s]  We want to check out the finale of that game. We have probably like two or three hours left on that game
[15507.60s -> 15510.61s]  That's the plan tomorrow
[15511.65s -> 15518.05s]  I'm getting kind of hungry though. I'll probably maybe like another 20 30 minutes five hours
[15527.14s -> 15529.14s]  Ooh, that was close
[15529.38s -> 15535.40s]  Okay, here's uh five just two there's four there's five there's three there's two there's two

[15564.28s -> 15566.84s]  Whoa, he's hard. Yeah, that's a bad character
[15596.63s -> 15608.28s]  You're not there you're

[15665.77s -> 15671.15s]  18 bolts and mike let's go
[15672.11s -> 15678.62s]  Let's dance

[15689.96s -> 15709.93s]  Or we launch the best. I really think so that one's easy for him
[15769.47s -> 15771.47s]  Oh scissors beats paper I did
[15780.03s -> 15803.71s]  Um one two one two three four
[15823.21s -> 15825.21s]  Oh my god
[15877.85s -> 15880.54s]  It's not how you build a snowman you put his head on the bottom
[15901.64s -> 15910.80s]  Come on
[15913.61s -> 15917.71s]  We do it we do it we do it we do it we do it we do it I got the 38
[15923.04s -> 15924.38s]  Mike

[15929.53s -> 15932.17s]  Jimmy was okay
[15932.17s -> 15940.67s]  Nine gold. Oh, I know why the usain is a desync. It's because of this
[15941.39s -> 15946.30s]  It's the my camera's fucked up. I can't fix it. I literally have to restart my computer
[15959.58s -> 15968.41s]  I gotta get the 10 without losing the light. It's really important. Yes, I thought it erased us
[15973.10s -> 15976.81s]  Why did I pick nine volt?
[15976.81s -> 15978.81s]  Maybe it's the wild card I need
[15982.09s -> 15984.09s]  Maybe it was pink poop. I don't know
[15985.05s -> 15997.68s]  Holy shit, it's so hard to do that. Uh, yeah
[16000.20s -> 16002.36s]  And how do you do that with this character by the way?
[16027.80s -> 16034.96s]  He's gotta go
[16034.96s -> 16037.52s]  You gotta go that guy that character has to go. No way
[16056.12s -> 16072.08s]  I'm not doing period. He's bad actually kind of like dog

[16366.20s -> 16378.70s]  Get in there do it. I thought I'd shoot him in his nose. I thought I should write his nose
[16423.92s -> 16425.92s]  Hmm
[16445.39s -> 16449.31s]  All right, I got to 41 I can do it. All right, only two or three more tries
[16479.36s -> 16483.76s]  I'm not looking over here anymore
[16524.01s -> 16534.51s]  Whoa

[16682.44s -> 16684.44s]  You don't have to like scream
[16684.44s -> 16687.40s]  It's fine. Just play with the characters you did it with before
[16688.44s -> 16691.60s]  And do it
[16691.60s -> 16694.73s]  There'll be consequences
[16708.60s -> 16710.60s]  Actually like
[16721.31s -> 16738.05s]  I'm gonna get 15 without getting hurt. I don't even know i've never seen that before

[16919.40s -> 16940.20s]  I'm leaning back. I'm just gonna lie back like this
[16940.84s -> 16970.03s]  Underwear stuck to my ass
[16989.16s -> 16992.46s]  God, it's gonna take a goddamn robot to get it off
[17180.46s -> 17182.46s]  Why doesn't the basket move
[17182.94s -> 17185.95s]  The basket don't move man
[17230.72s -> 17232.72s]  I hate that one
[17276.76s -> 17280.03s]  That's not a
[17283.98s -> 17285.98s]  God damn fucking close
[17286.78s -> 17290.81s]  That was so goddamn close
[17310.33s -> 17312.33s]  That's impossible with that character
[17339.60s -> 17341.60s]  The fucking ufo is over me
[17359.84s -> 17378.54s]  It's just you don't even give me a fucking goddamn moments notice 47. Oh my god, it's so close. It's killing me
[17379.50s -> 17382.83s]  Damn it 47
[17383.79s -> 17391.45s]  All right, let's go great
[17399.95s -> 17414.59s]  Goddamn gamer, let me show you my eyes are watering. I'm a gamer. Yeah
[17465.52s -> 17469.40s]  I'm a monster i'll show you a monster
[17469.40s -> 17471.90s]  Here
[17491.58s -> 17498.20s]  Tick tock he's emo. I thought if I pulled that out that would be great
[17499.40s -> 17501.88s]  All right, if it's I gotta I gotta go I gotta stop screaming. I'm done
[17502.52s -> 17507.16s]  I'm done. I'm done. I'm gonna play like the funny open at the ball game thing and then i'm done
[17551.48s -> 17553.76s]  He did ate it
[17567.21s -> 17571.50s]  Here
[17601.82s -> 17624.59s]  You only need one life to win just need one to win
[17666.99s -> 17668.99s]  What the fuck
[17670.43s -> 17682.96s]  I have so much money close your eyes. God damn
[17683.68s -> 17693.52s]  Touch no more mistakes
[17699.26s -> 17701.26s]  No more mistakes
[17706.97s -> 17708.97s]  No more mistakes
[17713.02s -> 17714.70s]  Read my lips
[17714.70s -> 17747.08s]  No new mistakes
[17747.16s -> 17749.16s]  I don't even know if they're fucked up
[17787.29s -> 17792.33s]  This happens so fast it's so hard to it happens so quickly that like you're just gonna get caught up
[17793.61s -> 17798.17s]  Like you're gonna get caught up going the wrong way. You know what I mean? Like i'm gonna get you're gonna get caught going the wrong fucking way
[17798.65s -> 17801.71s]  It's over
[17801.71s -> 17805.87s]  All right, this is my last attempt and then i'm done i'm not doing it again
[17832.52s -> 17856.73s]  You guys just burning money if you vote for me more like that, please you fucking come on
[17858.20s -> 17860.20s]  You're fucking kidding me
[17867.53s -> 17869.53s]  There's three
[17870.84s -> 17876.49s]  My god, it's not gonna happen man. This shit is impossible
[17877.66s -> 17879.42s]  This shit is impossible
[17879.42s -> 17894.78s]  It's the fact that you have to change character and I and I don't know what the half of these goddamn games are
[17895.66s -> 17905.47s]  I like some of them fly some of them don't fly some of them fucking move. Some of them don't move
[17905.47s -> 17907.47s]  Some of them have guns some of them don't have guns
[17910.08s -> 17914.43s]  One more I mean it and i'm gonna watch i'm gonna do it fucking backwards
[17966.81s -> 17986.49s]  It looks like it was the same color as the other one. I'm gonna okay. This is my okay. That's it. I'm out of gas i'm gone
[17987.45s -> 17992.73s]  I'm literally out of energy i'm done i'm toast i'm it's like i'm cooked my goose is cooked i'm done
[17997.48s -> 18001.56s]  Okay, when I got to 47 that was literally six months of my life that I just deleted
[18002.44s -> 18013.77s]  It's gonna happen. It's gonna happen right now
[18039.64s -> 18043.40s]  Three no, not four. I didn't want to hit it more than what I didn't want to hit it
[18043.40s -> 18065.55s]  What
[18122.40s -> 18127.50s]  That one doesn't count it actually doesn't that one actually does not count you're right
[18133.31s -> 18145.12s]  That one doesn't count that was just a warm-up
[18145.12s -> 18155.10s]  Please
[18176.58s -> 18181.04s]  What
[18181.04s -> 18183.04s]  I fucking hate it
[18183.04s -> 18235.07s]  Maybe you should try easy
[18235.07s -> 18252.11s]  Damn it. I've got people to feed here. You love helicopters. Take it
[18254.53s -> 18258.30s]  You go higher than president
[18258.30s -> 18259.82s]  presidential suite
[18259.82s -> 18263.15s]  Let's do like
[18263.15s -> 18267.52s]  You like cameras? No. No, you don't really like cameras that much
[18272.53s -> 18284.82s]  Uh
[18291.28s -> 18293.28s]  Wait, you're the 47th floor guy
[18294.08s -> 18308.45s]  Ooh headphones
[18308.45s -> 18315.23s]  What do you like?
[18315.23s -> 18318.11s]  How about a shower cap?
[18318.67s -> 18324.37s]  47 is good, but certainly not 50
[18327.17s -> 18328.37s]  Oh, yeah
[18328.37s -> 18337.18s]  That's what you think
[18337.18s -> 18345.76s]  Okay, that's what that's what you think
[18373.04s -> 18377.46s]  I don't understand that one
[18379.06s -> 18383.22s]  I'm done. I'm out of matter. I'm leaving
[18383.86s -> 18401.49s]  Okay, how about we just go with the fuck face team because it doesn't matter i'm not gonna win so let's do whatever
[18402.29s -> 18423.55s]  Here we go. Not bad. Oh, I get it now
[18433.82s -> 18443.92s]  No doggy
[18444.64s -> 18456.85s]  She's holding a what I thought I was talking about me
[18466.67s -> 18480.03s]  Okay, that's enough, um, that's enough i've had enough i've had enough one more
[18480.67s -> 18482.67s]  This is my final attempt
[18483.15s -> 18486.99s]  the last one if I don't get it here then I am going to
[18489.33s -> 18493.25s]  Walk out last one. This is the fuck. This is literally the last one if I do another one
[18493.25s -> 18499.27s]  I will literally okay if I do another one after this I will give a thousand community subs, okay?
[18613.66s -> 18615.66s]  I
[18620.30s -> 18622.30s]  Couldn't tell the difference
[18636.99s -> 18642.54s]  I have to stop
[18642.54s -> 18647.33s]  God damn it. God damn it. I want to do it so bad
[18678.78s -> 18679.98s]  Yes
[18679.98s -> 18686.02s]  All right, so i'm not gonna do that one right that but i'm not i'm not gonna do that one again
[18686.90s -> 18688.66s]  I can play the other one
[18688.66s -> 18691.42s]  I can do this one
[18691.42s -> 18698.26s]  It's for this one. It's not for the it's not for any of the other levels in the game
[18704.64s -> 18708.56s]  Double or nothing for five more attempts. No way, dude, that's five thousand sub
[18710.18s -> 18711.70s]  I'm not doing that
[18711.70s -> 18717.76s]  I'm not doing that
[18717.76s -> 18722.08s]  Okay, but does that count? I need I need to like a general consensus. Does that count?
[18722.96s -> 18724.96s]  If I were to do a different level
[18724.96s -> 18734.21s]  That doesn't count. It's only that crazy one that i'm trying to get 50 rounds on
[18735.74s -> 18737.74s]  No, i'm just gonna play
[18737.82s -> 18742.74s]  I'm done. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm gonna play no more heroes three tomorrow
[18743.63s -> 18748.91s]  And then when I beat no more heroes three tomorrow, it's only gonna take like a couple hours to get through that
[18749.07s -> 18751.07s]  I'm getting to 50 tomorrow
[18751.07s -> 18759.18s]  I'm getting to 50 tomorrow after no more heroes three
[18768.19s -> 18771.54s]  Well, what should I give this for a rating?
[18772.26s -> 18774.24s]  um
[18774.24s -> 18781.52s]  Okay, here we go. Is it so the rating of this game?
[18782.72s -> 18785.92s]  First of all, thanks to the subs everybody all the resubs all the new subs all of you
[18786.40s -> 18794.91s]  Some of you might be brand new some of you have been here for 10 years. Thanks guys. Really appreciate it
[18796.10s -> 18801.30s]  Maybe we'll see you tomorrow for no more heroes three finale and uh get to level 50 in super hard on wario wear
[18805.12s -> 18808.94s]  I'm gonna get some food. I've been okay. Well here you go. I've had a lot of fun with it
[18809.50s -> 18811.50s]  I still want to play so that's a good indicator
[18812.46s -> 18815.82s]  Uh, it was probably like a six and a half or a seven out of ten
[18816.86s -> 18823.66s]  until I realized that you could collect those coins and feed your
[18824.30s -> 18835.39s]  Crew I think that became a solid eight something after that like an 8.2 the actual video game. I think
[18836.27s -> 18840.99s]  It was a little short, but I think was the other one. I feel like the other one was longer
[18841.39s -> 18844.19s]  I feel like smooth moves was a longer game
[18844.83s -> 18851.07s]  Just with more mini games and stuff. Maybe i'm just completely wrong, but um, I think it's really good
[18860.86s -> 18862.46s]  I'm like i'm watching this cutscene
[18862.46s -> 18868.22s]  What am I talking about? I'm talking about warrior wear smooth moves being a longer game than this one
[18868.54s -> 18879.60s]  I remember playing it for a little longer. They have insanely short story, but tons of post game shit
[18879.84s -> 18882.64s]  Yeah, I think I'd have to play it a little bit more to figure that out
[18882.88s -> 18890.67s]  This one seems it has like daily challenges and stuff. That's really cool. Yeah, I think it's it's great
[18891.70s -> 18902.13s]  Way better than game in wario by a thousand times this game has about 20 more micro games than smooth moves
[18902.37s -> 18905.92s]  You know what? I think it is. I think that like the wiimote
[18906.77s -> 18910.13s]  Moving around the wiimote and doing stuff with the wiimote felt a little more involved
[18910.77s -> 18915.01s]  Than jumping with a 2d character to like turn a knob with your character on the screen
[18915.25s -> 18921.76s]  I think that's maybe what what i'm thinking of there when i'm seeing it like that
[18923.92s -> 18927.38s]  I I think the concept is great. It's actually a really really cool concept
[18927.38s -> 18938.29s]  It throws your brain off even more than the original games. Yeah, i'll see you tomorrow. Take care of yourselves. Goodbye
[18938.77s -> 18944.30s]  Tomorrow normal heroes 3 finale by the way, if you haven't seen normal heroes 3 and you want to play it yourself
[18944.78s -> 18949.98s]  Be careful on tomorrow's first couple hours of the stream because it's literally the last like two or three hours of the whole game
[18950.38s -> 18953.49s]  So we'll see you tomorrow. Good night. Goodbye
[18954.27s -> 18958.43s]  My voice is shot because i've been screaming it's literally been a scream stream. I hope you've been enjoying it
[18958.67s -> 18961.94s]  I hope you've been enjoying it. Yes. That's what I was trying to say
[18962.50s -> 18964.35s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow
[18964.35s -> 18966.98s]  Good night. Goodbye
[18966.98s -> 19006.59s]  See you later
