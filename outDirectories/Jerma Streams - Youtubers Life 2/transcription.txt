[849.54s -> 853.59s]  It's just is all right. Let me be really honest. Hold on a minute. Let me just clear my throat
[854.31s -> 857.69s]  Comes a boomer take it's too much work to hear like this

[923.92s -> 927.38s]  This is great though. Let's have huge headphones
[927.38s -> 933.82s]  I don't know why that became a thing you wear these things for more than an hour and you'll take them off and it's like
[934.50s -> 946.89s]  Ow and if you touch your hair touches your ears, it's like fuck that hurts. I don't understand these that's true

[976.93s -> 980.70s]  I would you don't wear that to like go get coffee at Starbucks
[980.78s -> 986.97s]  I wouldn't the amount of time it takes to button those four buttons is too much time for me to go get like a coffee
[987.17s -> 994.96s]  Now if I was if there was like a event I was going to or if it was like a work thing or something
[994.96s -> 1003.94s]  Yeah, that's just too much. It's too much time. Maybe I'm just a weirdo, which I mean, maybe I am
[1004.18s -> 1020.76s]  There we go. Not too much time. Just a jacket. It's a little weird. Just put the seashells on. No, that's that's too wacky
[1020.76s -> 1022.76s]  I don't want it. I don't that's way too wacky
[1023.16s -> 1034.53s]  They just have like a pac-man t-shirt with wicked stained underarms like stained yellow underarms with like just a white t-shirt with stained
[1034.53s -> 1059.05s]  Underarms, where is that? This will do. All right, and like like a bathing suit. I wear jeans
[1059.05s -> 1064.50s]  I do I wear jeans or shorts. That's pretty
[1065.42s -> 1076.81s]  That's almost too put together. You know, I mean like the white tee and the jeans is almost like you're doing that on purpose
[1076.81s -> 1094.52s]  It's too put together. There we go. All right, that looks good. What's wrong with nothing? Just put an X. Wait, what?
[1094.56s -> 1097.82s]  Oh my god, you can
[1097.86s -> 1107.25s]  Wait, you can't right? I mean, uh, why would you be I'm not gonna walk around like this

[1118.10s -> 1123.84s]  This is just how I live every day in my privacy of my own place
[1123.96s -> 1128.82s]  If I was to make a video on YouTube, but this would be my outfit
[1128.82s -> 1132.02s]  That's what that's what I would be wearing right now. I wouldn't wear the sneakers though
[1132.22s -> 1139.14s]  It'd be big big white tube socks like your dad wears I don't wear those either they cut off circulation in my legs
[1139.14s -> 1141.96s]  That's a lie. I don't believe that
[1141.96s -> 1147.58s]  Yeah, this is it. This is literally what I wear every day
[1149.34s -> 1151.72s]  I'm starting to become like more aware of this now
[1152.22s -> 1155.99s]  But yeah, like just flip-flops a pair of shorts and nothing
[1156.15s -> 1163.42s]  This is what I wear every day, but the sunglasses aren't accurate, but then we're doing that for fun

[1687.21s -> 1698.45s]  Okay, this is a normie germa. Well, you didn't say that you said normal beep beep nice acting David
[1698.53s -> 1710.46s]  I mean acting as well as it wasn't a vlog. We who's acting on a vlog first
[1710.46s -> 1712.46s]  We'll touch it up a bit by editing on your computer
[1712.46s -> 1721.56s]  What if I don't want this is not how this works
[1721.56s -> 1725.86s]  I have to make like 30 of these in a row before I decide which one I actually want to use
[1726.02s -> 1738.16s]  Okay vlog recording trends. Okay vlog this tool is the video editor
[1738.16s -> 1740.76s]  You can use it to edit your videos and finish giving them your personal touch
[1740.98s -> 1746.60s]  Okay, the goal is to get as many points as possible. Make sure the clips connect to each other
[1746.60s -> 1748.60s]  Well, I'm gonna fuck this whole thing up
[1748.60s -> 1750.98s]  If you manage to connect them from the start to the end of the video
[1750.98s -> 1756.76s]  You'll get a juicy bonus later when you have a better PC with more rendering points
[1756.80s -> 1764.79s]  You'll be able to buy video effects and use them in your clips to boost your edits even more and now I'll let the creative genius
[1764.79s -> 1774.19s]  Unleash his imagination. All right, I don't know what the context of these clips even is I like see this
[1774.19s -> 1781.74s]  Oh, they have like connecting points. This is so stupid
[1785.12s -> 1787.12s]  Okay, this is just like a puzzle. I
[1787.68s -> 1796.17s]  Need a connector here. I
[1796.21s -> 1806.73s]  Can't I editing videos is hard. What do I start with this one? It's the pipe game
[1806.73s -> 1821.35s]  I don't think I can even connect these can I I have enough pieces to do this
[1821.39s -> 1843.62s]  I don't think I have enough pieces to do this. Who cares just go in order. I don't care
[1843.62s -> 1855.12s]  I don't think you can do it choose the video's thumbnail. They're all the same. Everything's the same video bad video
[1855.50s -> 1883.90s]  She's clickbait phrase if this was accurate if this is accurate. This person has no idea what they're doing
[1885.71s -> 1891.58s]  Okay, that looks good dot web M. I
[1893.18s -> 1903.40s]  Can't I can't add anything to it. It's fine. I like this title. Why can I publish video? Yeah, let's go include the date stamp
[1903.40s -> 1915.62s]  Oh shit, that's right video posted final score. Oh, no, you're not famous yet. You did one video. What the fuck?
[1915.98s -> 1918.10s]  What the hell just what now?
[1918.10s -> 1918.98s]  It's not worth it
[1918.98s -> 1924.62s]  PP grab your phone and install the new tube app
[1924.90s -> 1931.29s]  Check the video you just post and see other youtubers ranking in the city your goal gain loads of subscribers
[1931.55s -> 1936.26s]  Okay, check out the new tube app. Yeah
[1936.70s -> 1949.90s]  Okay, my profile journal contacts new tube your latest videos my ranking one video published three likes
[1949.90s -> 1960.62s]  It was me at least one of those is me. You guys have to understand something when you're starting out
[1960.62s -> 1968.14s]  I remember like 10 plus years ago. I remember the proportion of likes to dislikes where
[1968.66s -> 1975.30s]  It's when you have three or four likes and even one or two dislikes. That's a potential 50%
[1975.82s -> 1982.18s]  Ratio one dislike here is world-changing. I remember when that used to happen
[1982.18s -> 1988.34s]  I would have a video go up and it would be like 30 40 likes and there would be like two or three dislikes and I'd be
[1988.58s -> 1990.98s]  That's fucking world-ending. That's such a huge percentage
[1991.70s -> 2002.98s]  Zero views where you see zero views. Oh shit. There's no views
[2003.46s -> 2013.19s]  Okay, let's go back. All right, so I have this my cats are trending
[2013.95s -> 2018.82s]  deity of war honey play studios one and adventure games
[2018.82s -> 2032.34s]  All right, we need to have a cat in the video. All right, did you know that I can also record it commentary scripts on the computer?
[2033.61s -> 2036.55s]  Scripts are a type of video. I don't know how to record without them
[2036.91s -> 2039.19s]  Xavier says there's a load of them hidden around the city
[2039.47s -> 2045.93s]  Have to go plagiarize people every time you record with a script you improve its quality and this is how you get better clips
[2045.93s -> 2051.64s]  And scores shall we try a commentary video to see if you get the first 30 subscribers to your channel
[2051.76s -> 2071.56s]  Okay, I just go around and like take steal scripts from trash cans. Let's go 30 subs. I can do it commentary. Let's go
[2074.07s -> 2076.05s]  Why am I like
[2076.05s -> 2078.05s]  Using mind like powers
[2078.37s -> 2080.55s]  To start the video
[2080.55s -> 2089.15s]  Shyly say hello poltergeist appears and a poltergeist appears where you have a laughing fit
[2089.15s -> 2094.85s]  that's what I would do you go on and on and then
[2095.49s -> 2107.20s]  Let's get into chill mode here again. I don't know if somebody likes this and it's over you asked for subscribers and it's over
[2107.20s -> 2114.36s]  All right. We're gonna have to sign off we go
[2114.76s -> 2121.72s]  All right, save
[2121.72s -> 2129.29s]  Remember that you need to edit and post the video on the computer. Here's a commentary. Oh fuck people gonna think I'm so stupid
[2130.65s -> 2139.66s]  I'm not supposed to go in order. Okay, so this one has the down down. I can't connect these
[2139.98s -> 2151.75s]  There's no way I can possibly connect all these just go in order. There's there's no what do you mean?
[2151.87s -> 2156.20s]  You're not supposed to connect all of them. Oh
[2156.80s -> 2158.81s]  Okay
[2158.81s -> 2166.13s]  Does that get double points get as many connections as possible and not just put them all on there?
[2166.13s -> 2172.53s]  Okay, hold on. Can I get more like this?
[2172.89s -> 2185.08s]  Now it has to start with this because it's red. All right, there you go
[2185.12s -> 2194.66s]  Well, how's this worse editing 1 2 3 4 this 1 1 1 2 there's no 1 2 3 4 it's 1 1 1 2
[2196.49s -> 2198.49s]  What do you see 1 2 3 4?
[2202.50s -> 2212.34s]  1 1 1 2. Oh, that's 14 14
[2212.80s -> 2217.48s]  You have to get to the 10-minute mark so you get the post roll
[2218.16s -> 2226.01s]  No, I had it right the first time see that's good. That's good enough. Oh, this is stupid
[2226.01s -> 2233.91s]  Video where I'm sitting naked just fucking saying hi to people. This one is 30 points
[2233.91s -> 2235.95s]  I try I connected the three and it was like 20
[2235.95s -> 2243.80s]  I can what best kept youtubers secret by adding effects to your clips
[2243.80s -> 2250.64s]  You can make your video to the stratosphere excuse render points, but you'll have to update the editor and buy them first
[2250.64s -> 2264.79s]  Oh, I only have a hundred render points. I can't do anything about this. Let me just see what happens if I do this
[2265.55s -> 2289.39s]  18 see the other one was better. See I know what I'm doing. You're a washed-up youtuber. You're never gonna hit it big
[2289.83s -> 2292.83s]  No
[2292.83s -> 2300.54s]  Probably not anymore. If I started those TF2 videos now people just think I was a fucking moron
[2300.54s -> 2310.48s]  I sure did luck out on that one. All right title. No what video?
[2310.88s -> 2317.52s]  Excuse me. I think my videos were very interesting and interesting topics. I don't get me wrong. I love all my videos
[2317.52s -> 2334.80s]  They're all my children. All right title who cares
[2335.42s -> 2342.47s]  This is how you make the best commentary with hashtag home. I play like the metadata
[2342.55s -> 2346.03s]  Should I put hashtag cats but that no this stuff never works
[2346.19s -> 2352.56s]  If you put hashtag cats in here and it's a trending topic people come to the channel and they say there's no cat here
[2352.58s -> 2367.67s]  This guy's a dick. I hate this guy as they make people hate you. I was like
[2367.67s -> 2371.35s]  Oh, man, you gotta make sure you're like tags are really like really pull viewers and shit
[2371.43s -> 2375.31s]  They'll just lie to people and everyone hates me after like a month
[2376.07s -> 2389.04s]  How would I do that? That was better than the last one. Thank you. I got subs
[2389.60s -> 2395.06s]  Holy shit 30 scripted video game subscribers that give them to you in the very beginning to go through the tutorial to make sure you
[2395.06s -> 2396.46s]  Get to over a hundred
[2396.46s -> 2401.60s]  Ring, it's already midnight. It's time to go to bed
[2402.04s -> 2405.24s]  Sleeping helps you get back your energy and progress to the next day
[2405.24s -> 2412.69s]  You can stay awake until 4 a.m. You won't be able to get all your energy back for the next day. Good night, David
[2412.85s -> 2418.49s]  I'll call you tomorrow morning to tell you something important. Don't call me anymore Xavier. In fact, I'm gonna change
[2418.49s -> 2422.71s]  I'm changing like literally I'm changing my name. I'm changing everything about my life
[2424.00s -> 2431.00s]  I don't like this guy. He's scary. Let's go to bed. Ooh
[2437.09s -> 2449.35s]  I thought I was in a bathtub for a second. Maybe they're sleeping with the sandals on. Yeah, that's weird
[2452.72s -> 2460.24s]  Seems today is gonna be a good day. Luck is on your side young youtuber. What am I a fucking padawan? Okay
[2460.24s -> 2470.04s]  I need to I need to do a video about armored nucleus. Hmm. Hmm
[2470.52s -> 2477.29s]  Hey David, I just saw the videos you uploaded to your channel. They're good, but you might have noticed that they haven't gotten many visits
[2477.45s -> 2480.21s]  That's because they aren't good. I'm lying to you
[2480.21s -> 2485.50s]  I'm a manager agent person that just roped you into this isn't scamming you and it's gonna take
[2485.66s -> 2491.43s]  40% of all of your money check the daily trends to record and upload a video on them
[2491.43s -> 2503.88s]  You'll get more visits and subs check the trends on my phone. All right, here's my quests
[2504.58s -> 2514.50s]  Pay attention to what's currently trending in the city. They're split according to popularity into unknown normal well-known very there
[2514.50s -> 2519.03s]  It's their loot its loot colors
[2519.31s -> 2529.19s]  So this is okay this high profile. Oh my god now the deity of war game is pretty popular
[2529.19s -> 2532.93s]  But when you see any high profile or trending topic, you've got to go for it
[2536.78s -> 2541.22s]  This type of mentality to me is just like the ambulance chaser of like the lawyer world
[2541.22s -> 2541.62s]  No
[2541.62s -> 2544.48s]  I don't just make videos on what you want to make videos on
[2544.62s -> 2551.33s]  Like if I wake up in the morning and I see that like cats are trending on fucking YouTube
[2551.55s -> 2554.11s]  I'm not gonna rip out of the covers
[2554.11s -> 2557.15s]  Scramble to get out of bed and freak out to make a cat's video
[2557.15s -> 2562.30s]  They just do what you feel like doing make the videos make this stuff that you'd like to do
[2562.30s -> 2563.50s]  I don't I don't like this
[2563.50s -> 2571.78s]  I don't that's not don't listen to this popular trends in your content is the key to your videos getting lots of views and subscribers
[2571.78s -> 2577.79s]  This is why you aren't successful
[2580.63s -> 2582.94s]  This guy this guy over
[2584.99s -> 2586.99s]  Okay, well
[2587.31s -> 2589.30s]  Hmm
[2589.30s -> 2596.45s]  Six or seven million subscribers across all the platforms. I mean, it's like seven or eight million subscribers followers
[2596.45s -> 2605.59s]  I mean not was excuse me. It's definitely like not even a million by the way
[2605.99s -> 2609.38s]  It's I think it's like two million total
[2612.38s -> 2621.66s]  Arrogant have you seen that highest trending videos are about video games to record these kinds of videos
[2621.66s -> 2624.22s]  You need to install a gaming corner in your home. Why?
[2627.47s -> 2631.95s]  Remember you're a shadowy elite
[2634.03s -> 2643.22s]  This person saying it read arrogant prick. Fuck you. We all hate you and watch you to make fun of you behind your back
[2643.86s -> 2659.22s]  Well, is it behind my back when you're all here doing it now? Oh, I'm aware. I need a gaming corner
[2659.34s -> 2667.07s]  Okay, add furniture add new workspace gaming corner
[2667.07s -> 2681.42s]  I wish I put this over here in the corner. I mean it says gaming corner
[2681.42s -> 2687.81s]  Oh, I feel like it'd have to be in a corner perfect
[2687.81s -> 2692.33s]  Now you've set up your gaming corner now all you need to do is game and a console and you be able to start recording gaming
[2692.33s -> 2693.33s]  videos
[2693.33s -> 2699.88s]  Alright many youtubers post gaming content try to find the most popular video games by the way
[2699.88s -> 2702.84s]  I've ordered you a game and a console so you can start go speak
[2702.84s -> 2706.92s]  Why did you buy me things go speak to Blair the girl in the player one video game store?
[2706.92s -> 2711.19s]  She'll give them to you. I think this actually is something
[2711.79s -> 2715.27s]  Playing the popular games on Twitch and YouTube is almost a guaranteed way to
[2715.67s -> 2724.90s]  Not get very much attention like if I would have start playing a game that's in like the top 10 right now
[2725.06s -> 2731.03s]  There's potentially thousands and thousands and thousands of people doing that too. It doesn't matter how much it's trending
[2732.95s -> 2742.68s]  It's hard to stand out when you play the most popular video games because if I were to start streaming right now
[2742.68s -> 2745.24s]  Let's say I don't know what's like a really popular game right now
[2745.24s -> 2747.91s]  I don't like League of Legends or something, right?
[2747.95s -> 2755.16s]  If I were to start doing that now, there are probably thousands of other people all in the same boat doing the same thing
[2755.16s -> 2761.21s]  It's it's harder to stand out when you play like the popular trending topics
[2761.21s -> 2776.66s]  Even nobody's looking for youtubers life to content. Hey, you figured me out. You figured out the secret recipe play shit that nobody likes
[2779.72s -> 2790.54s]  Check the map app if you don't want to get lost beep beep. All right, it's all I got I have to go talk to this
[2790.54s -> 2797.14s]  Person play dragon rompo. I don't know what that is people keep asking me to do that
[2797.14s -> 2808.76s]  All right, so I gotta go get the console. Okay, and that is oh my vlog got three coins
[2808.76s -> 2825.17s]  All right, the player one video game store. Where's that net flow these all aspiring youtubers? Can I talk restaurant?
[2829.22s -> 2840.81s]  Okay, do I have a map? All right, we need to go to player one. All right, so right there
[2840.81s -> 2847.54s]  There's my house was literally right across the goddamn Street. Okay. No, I'm kidding
[2847.54s -> 2849.14s]  I play the things I think are fun
[2849.14s -> 2852.70s]  You guys have seen me play popular games on this channel for like a decade
[2853.10s -> 2855.38s]  I'm listening to anything I say it's all horseshit
[2855.94s -> 2871.21s]  Player one. Did I play smite if you want to play it and you think it's fun?
[2871.53s -> 2877.11s]  All right, so I'm picking up my console that this weird guy that just flew me out here ordered for me
[2877.39s -> 2884.11s]  Okay, League of Stars
[2884.11s -> 2900.08s]  What do I pick it up? Talk to Blair. Is this Blair? Where's Blair this deity of war? It's Dixie behind the counter
[2900.26s -> 2905.98s]  Okay. Hi, I don't help you with something. I'm here on behalf of Xavier
[2906.46s -> 2910.55s]  Okay, you're the new youtuber in town. Well Xavier called me to give you this
[2910.75s -> 2916.06s]  You are the console honey play studios one in the game deity of war
[2916.06s -> 2924.94s]  I would not hold this like this. They're all stored in your bag bag has limited space
[2925.34s -> 2933.56s]  This is just how people that go to the midnight release for games that do this
[2933.72s -> 2938.94s]  They run out if you're the first in line you run out with the thing you hold it up and everyone fucking cheers
[2938.94s -> 2951.75s]  Everyone's like yeah. Hey David. Do you have the game and console yet? Yes, right now. Let's record your first gameplay
[2952.07s -> 2974.04s]  Our new wow expansion. Oh, dude wrath of the Lich King. Are you serious Nax is out?
[2975.10s -> 2981.67s]  All right, let's go make a gameplay video. Wow. I played wow for like 30 years
[2981.67s -> 2986.45s]  I'm gonna make a reference to it every now and then I have talked about this before but listen to this
[2986.45s -> 2994.02s]  I have been there's more Wow in my head than I believe
[2994.26s -> 2996.34s]  Potentially time that I was in college
[2996.82s -> 3003.01s]  You understand like the amount of time that I was sitting in a classroom in college
[3003.01s -> 3009.17s]  Probably is the amount of time also that I was in world of warcraft. It was hundreds of days
[3009.89s -> 3013.67s]  So, of course, it's gonna be up there
[3014.15s -> 3021.19s]  Head is empty
[3021.19s -> 3023.30s]  No, it's just it's no, you know
[3023.30s -> 3026.39s]  My head the head is too full
[3026.39s -> 3029.11s]  I would like to go in to my head and sort of
[3029.41s -> 3034.55s]  Defrag it and just sort of delete a bunch of old info that I don't even care about anymore to make room for more
[3034.55s -> 3046.93s]  Oh shit record a gameplay you first need to place the game and console in the gaming corner and select the game and get recording
[3047.33s -> 3054.13s]  Make me want to quit video. Wait, what do you say? You make me want to quit video games
[3054.13s -> 3060.95s]  So I don't end up like you what why?
[3061.99s -> 3071.43s]  What I'm not like screaming at you and what are you talking? I'm what does that mean? I'm kind of pretty normal
[3071.43s -> 3075.11s]  I'm just like hanging out. I said I what do you mean? I don't want to end up like you
[3075.59s -> 3092.95s]  I don't have any consoles. Oh, here we go console storage one. I put it on. Oh, here it is. Okay console and video game

[3105.18s -> 3107.76s]  tutorial first impressions speedrun

[3113.36s -> 3122.40s]  Okay, I have to have gameplay reactions. You start recording and say hello
[3122.56s -> 3128.61s]  Yeah, whatever you have to play the game you unlock a new map you ship
[3131.68s -> 3141.11s]  I unlocked a new map. I don't understand you play for giggles
[3142.93s -> 3149.81s]  Like you your health is at one percent, but you skip you skip you
[3150.29s -> 3160.69s]  No, but you skip you ship your health is at one percent. So you ship you skip you skip you ship
[3161.25s -> 3163.25s]  What am I what am I doing?
[3164.74s -> 3168.13s]  You ship and it's over

[3195.25s -> 3203.48s]  Like I have a board or just a map. I don't get it. All right, let's go edit
[3204.10s -> 3207.35s]  I'm edit and for everyone to hate me because I do this wrong every time
[3207.43s -> 3209.75s]  I'm gonna do this wrong every single time. Just want to make sure people are aware of that
[3209.83s -> 3217.11s]  I'm gonna do this wrong every single fucking time. I'm not kidding. All right, let's go with uh,
[3219.01s -> 3237.84s]  Double double. No, not that one that one that one. Here we go. Here we go. All right, here we go thumbnail
[3240.47s -> 3242.71s]  Uh this one
[3242.71s -> 3249.86s]  Become an expert in deity of war in 10 minutes 20 never before seen adventure tricks the deity of war revolution
[3252.12s -> 3267.25s]  They hate this though. Is that a good enough title?
[3267.73s -> 3283.49s]  So I just skip every cutscene and just ship every character part four
[3285.65s -> 3287.65s]  Oh, they like it. They like it
[3297.76s -> 3300.44s]  All right. I published a gameplay. I did it
[3306.36s -> 3307.64s]  My energy is low
[3307.64s -> 3311.03s]  What do I get?
[3311.03s -> 3314.50s]  Plain hamburger
[3314.50s -> 3320.68s]  There are people buried in my in my backyard. Hey david. I thought you might be hungry after a long session recording and editing videos
[3320.68s -> 3331.49s]  Here's a plain hamburger. You won't be able to record or edit videos if your energy runs out for plenty of energy
[3331.49s -> 3333.25s]  You eat something or go to sleep?
[3333.25s -> 3341.78s]  Bunker w eating a plain hamburger is like that's serial killer vibes for me plain hamburger with nothing on it
[3341.86s -> 3355.04s]  Nothing just bun and meat. That's it. I mean if there was ketchup on it or anything. It's weird, right?
[3355.44s -> 3360.72s]  Does any of you guys eat just a plain just one hamburger patty and just bun?
[3361.12s -> 3366.37s]  I feel like everybody adds something
[3366.37s -> 3372.77s]  Whether it's like a squeeze it i'm serious even like a squeeze of mustard like a tablespoon of mustard makes that not weird to me
[3373.09s -> 3381.65s]  Monka s chat full of serial killers
[3382.93s -> 3391.75s]  All right, luckily saviour just sent you some food. I'm not gonna eat food somebody sent in a box
[3394.26s -> 3405.27s]  Tablespoon is a lot of mustard. I've seen a lot of people put way more mustard than that. What do I eat big afk?
[3405.91s -> 3413.01s]  An irresistible hamburger with okay, it's fine. Although I would remove the tomato
[3415.88s -> 3419.24s]  I would remove the tomato and I would probably remove the ketchup as well
[3422.69s -> 3427.65s]  I'm not gonna do look. I don't have to do the tomato sucks rant every like two months
[3427.97s -> 3433.94s]  We should have a clip for it because I mean every time I talk about how I don't like tomato people go
[3434.02s -> 3436.90s]  What are you talking about? So should I just do a clip so people would take like, uh
[3437.38s -> 3447.12s]  Like exclamation point point like tomato. Okay, here we go
[3447.76s -> 3454.56s]  Just real quick i'm gonna get this out of the way tomato on sandwiches or burgers or anything if you put a slice of no
[3454.72s -> 3460.60s]  Don't get me wrong. I love tomatoes. I love the vegetable tomato. I love tomato sauce. I love
[3461.48s -> 3465.96s]  Roasted tomatoes roasted cherry tomatoes. I look like tomato if it's a tomato dish
[3466.04s -> 3473.60s]  I love it to make a slice of tomato on a hamburger or a sandwich is
[3474.38s -> 3479.17s]  disgusting to me because the tomato is usually wet and slimy and
[3479.49s -> 3481.46s]  If you take a bite
[3481.46s -> 3484.74s]  It turns to like this weird sludgy water in your mouth
[3484.82s -> 3491.86s]  And sometimes you pull the whole tomato out while you pull back a tomato does not necessarily belong on a sandwich for me
[3493.72s -> 3499.33s]  It makes whatever you're eating wetter. Let me ask you a question. You know, you wash lettuce
[3501.00s -> 3505.24s]  Imagine you took just wet lettuce you rinsed lettuce. You didn't even let it dry
[3505.24s -> 3506.28s]  You just washed it
[3506.28s -> 3510.60s]  It was soaking wet and you put it right on the bun and you it's gonna be watery watery lettuce and soggy
[3511.16s -> 3521.30s]  You really want that you got to let it dry wait for it dry it cools it down
[3521.88s -> 3523.08s]  How hot are you?
[3523.08s -> 3526.04s]  How are you eating your hamburgers? What temperature are you eating your meat at?
[3528.05s -> 3536.37s]  It cools the burger down. Okay, so clip that I love tomatoes. I do
[3536.69s -> 3542.66s]  I just don't like tomatoes sliced on a sandwich. It kind of messes it up for me
[3542.98s -> 3550.08s]  I feel the same way about some onions, right? I love onions on it
[3550.72s -> 3553.91s]  I love onions on a tomato, but I don't want it on
[3554.55s -> 3558.85s]  Somebody's ringing. What is it now? Why don't you relax a bit and explore the city?
[3560.63s -> 3564.71s]  You're new in town and you need to meet people having good friends, which will definitely help your youtuber career
[3565.03s -> 3570.37s]  There are certain celebrities and odd neighbors in new tube city. Why don't you go meet them?
[3570.61s -> 3575.00s]  Okay, let me close that out onions are good on a burger
[3575.72s -> 3581.48s]  But they have to be done. I don't like it when it's just the big circle onion ring without the bread on it
[3582.58s -> 3583.88s]  You know what i'm talking about?
[3583.88s -> 3585.75s]  Why do people do that?
[3585.75s -> 3590.15s]  You get like you bite it and you get like fucking onion skin and like the whole chunk comes off it
[3590.23s -> 3596.66s]  No, no, I don't get that chopped onions. Yes sliced onions. Yes, but that big
[3596.98s -> 3611.16s]  Onion ring onion. No, you're a nine-year-old. No, i'm just I don't like weird texture on my hamburgers
[3614.23s -> 3618.31s]  Do your teeth not work? It's just no, I don't like it. It's it's what are you talking about?
[3621.81s -> 3623.57s]  Do you like tobaccos?
[3623.57s -> 3629.72s]  What just order tomato on the side? It doesn't sog up the sandwich burger when you order to go
[3630.20s -> 3633.72s]  Yeah, but eventually i'm gonna be putting it on i'm just gonna eat the tomato like a potato chip
[3637.19s -> 3642.92s]  Can I have a slice of tomato on the side like just to go yes
[3645.97s -> 3649.91s]  That I don't really like tomatoes like that. Don't listen to them. You're right
[3649.91s -> 3657.19s]  I just don't like tomatoes like that because like the seed like the tomato like the insides. I don't know. It's just like
[3659.44s -> 3669.12s]  I don't like it. It's too mushy to be on a sandwich. What if they put tomato paste on a burger?
[3669.60s -> 3675.84s]  You're referring to ketchup, which I think is good. I like ketchup. I think that's fine
[3676.16s -> 3680.64s]  Dude, you know if they made like a hamburger
[3680.96s -> 3682.88s]  Uh
[3682.88s -> 3690.31s]  Tomato paste. All right. I'm gonna go out on a limb here if they made a burger that was
[3690.71s -> 3692.72s]  You know like a chicken palm sandwich
[3692.80s -> 3700.15s]  What if it was a burger palm and it was just a cheeseburger, but it had like marinara sauce and cheese on it
[3700.31s -> 3707.46s]  That might not be pretty good hamburger palm. There's your tomato paste hamburger
[3707.70s -> 3713.01s]  All right. I'm what am I supposed to be doing? You guys are distracting me
[3713.33s -> 3722.42s]  Okay spicy ren the best spicy dishes in newtube city. All right, so this is the restaurant
[3722.66s -> 3729.36s]  All right, we got trends here. Should I make another video? I was gonna make another video. Why not meet 10 neighbors?
[3729.44s -> 3739.27s]  All right. We're not i'm making another video. All right, we're gonna do a gameplay and can I talk about cats?
[3740.23s -> 3742.23s]  You start and I shyly say hello
[3744.18s -> 3753.09s]  Oh a mini boss appears and you make a technical comment. You explain the lore you skip the boss
[3754.71s -> 3761.59s]  Uh, oh all the gamers didn't like that. You sense a paranormal presence. You make a technical comment
[3764.34s -> 3771.17s]  You add you sign off and it's over should have talked about the lore
[3771.57s -> 3782.31s]  Do these have a description? I don't really know what these all mean. All right, let's go publish it
[3782.63s -> 3794.18s]  I should do a vlog too. Shouldn't I? All right, let's start with this one. I'm gonna go
[3798.36s -> 3801.60s]  This one this one this one
[3802.00s -> 3804.71s]  Sure, why not?
[3804.71s -> 3811.64s]  I don't care about what the title is. No, it doesn't matter. I just do one of these get the latest the biggest gameplay pro
[3812.04s -> 3829.51s]  How about the biggest gameplay pro of adventure when I skipped the boss? That's gonna piss off subscribers though my gameplay on home
[3831.03s -> 3833.03s]  I think that's probably the default
[3833.86s -> 3846.98s]  For if you save like a playstation 4 video on the ps4 action game play
[3848.21s -> 3855.51s]  Another game play the best game play gameplay. What about adventure another game play the best thing about deity of oar game play
[3856.21s -> 3862.92s]  Home game play gameplay. What about adventure? We're gonna talk about adventure game play. That's good
[3863.24s -> 3878.31s]  Do a two-minute fart prank video with eight-minute vlog about family stuff
[3881.59s -> 3885.09s]  What
[3885.09s -> 3901.97s]  A two-minute fart prank. I gotta go meet people but i'm tired. Hold on. Why would you read that?
[3904.34s -> 3909.65s]  My house is wait a minute. My home's value is increasing because
[3910.21s -> 3925.30s]  My subscribers are increasing. That's weird. That's how it works
[3927.03s -> 3947.04s]  You leave a bowl of candy out for trick-or-treaters you asshole. Excuse me. That's trespassing. No
[3949.01s -> 3949.81s]  Good morning, david
[3949.81s -> 3953.73s]  Did you know that the event all the youtubers are waiting for is coming to the city in the last week of spring?
[3960.76s -> 3965.89s]  Uh, I don't know what that is
[3965.89s -> 3969.33s]  It's the playcon gaming festival and it's celebrated once a year in newtube city
[3973.16s -> 3976.28s]  This festival will be full of influential people from the area conferences events
[3976.28s -> 3982.34s]  You can't miss the playcon if you want to make yourself known you're gonna get egged
[3986.74s -> 3988.74s]  You imagine I had like a note
[3989.38s -> 3992.42s]  Imagine you lived in a in a place and you put a note on your door
[3993.22s -> 3999.60s]  No halloween decorations nothing and it just said like the act of trick-or-treating is trespassing
[3999.76s -> 4004.96s]  I do not support this this this archaic old stupid lifestyle or something, right?
[4005.04s -> 4011.22s]  You have like a huge note on the door
[4011.22s -> 4014.90s]  That's the kind of person that I would assume would be the person that's complaining
[4015.68s -> 4019.92s]  If you had like an hoa or something about like your garbage cans being too far away from the curb
[4020.24s -> 4029.83s]  That's who that person I think is right
[4029.83s -> 4036.31s]  By the way use the fact that everyone is talking about the playcon festival to your advantage and post playcon content
[4039.44s -> 4045.65s]  Teepied or egged would you just wake up to like a completely mummified house?
[4049.99s -> 4065.92s]  I feel like that's you'd walk out the door turn around and your house would be just a completely mummified and then it rains
[4066.16s -> 4080.04s]  Oh god, what if it rained your house would just be taped paper mache
[4083.00s -> 4087.65s]  All right, let's go to the the convention. There's a huge promotional poster in the city
[4088.23s -> 4091.19s]  You know how you can post content almost instantly for your followers

[4141.32s -> 4146.39s]  Let's get serious do it because I want to

[4153.04s -> 4159.62s]  I feel like there's a shitload of pressure right now on a lot of people that are in the younger age brackets to constantly
[4160.26s -> 4167.84s]  Need to sort of make everybody aware of what they're doing. Just do it in moderation
[4168.72s -> 4175.01s]  Trust me. It feels like a lot of the younger crowd is in a constant competition with each other
[4175.25s -> 4189.03s]  You know what i'm saying? You're getting political. That's not political. That's just life
[4189.27s -> 4194.44s]  I'm so glad i'm not growing up with the social media stuff from today
[4194.44s -> 4200.88s]  I can't imagine how damaging that mindset is to little kids. Yeah, just be careful. Don't get too
[4201.44s -> 4206.40s]  Into it don't get too don't let it consume you because it can and I especially when you're really young too
[4206.40s -> 4209.12s]  Some of like the 10 11 12 13 year olds
[4209.36s -> 4214.85s]  I don't know. I just I feel like I i'd be like in this constant mindset of constant
[4215.88s -> 4218.28s]  You got a lot of shit to worry about too when you're like a teenager, right?
[4218.44s -> 4234.05s]  It's like another thing to have to be in a constant competition about it's limited. This stream is 18 plus. They're not here
[4234.53s -> 4245.49s]  Move on it's a social network app for you to share your photos with your followers instantly

[4258.26s -> 4264.37s]  They've done surveys that said that yeah, it's a lot to have to pay attention to like guys

[4541.92s -> 4546.20s]  Flatter yourself in front of the gym. I gotta get swole

[4703.11s -> 4709.12s]  Like across like the dating apps. It's like this is this is a really fucking person
[4714.15s -> 4716.15s]  Like is this even a real dude?

[4790.15s -> 4795.56s]  Have you noticed that the trend you just got has been captured?
[4796.64s -> 4800.40s]  There are trends that when you discover them remain captured and you can talk about them in another kind of script
[4802.40s -> 4807.28s]  See which script you can use it in and take the opportunity to record a video of it because only it only lasts one day
[4810.44s -> 4813.19s]  I record a video in front of this
[4813.19s -> 4815.19s]  post a gameplay with playcon

[9603.16s -> 9632.12s]  Okay. All right, you like it. I just got a bunch of subs for this
[9632.44s -> 9641.04s]  You know, I often get letters from admirers but today a super intense letter from someone called
[9642.85s -> 9650.28s]  To bercio arrived asking me to return to boxing. What's strange is that it has the elite fitness club scene on it
[9650.28s -> 9656.60s]  I think to bercio is the real name of that stuck-up guy who works here boosts or roots or something like that
[9657.32s -> 9663.27s]  All right. Well, I want to do push-ups. So what am I gonna how do I do that?
[9663.67s -> 9683.97s]  Where do you do push-ups on the ground on the floor? Yeah, but I couldn't do them
[9684.45s -> 9697.25s]  Can I do anything out here? All right. Well, I obviously can't so what what's the goal here?
[9704.32s -> 9705.76s]  Just do a stretch
[9705.76s -> 9716.26s]  I saw on insta-life that the fire serpent boxer might be coming back to fight that chick rocks
[9717.20s -> 9726.47s]  Fire serpent take a picture and then do a push-up. There's no push-up pose
[9727.11s -> 9740.36s]  Okay, who's this?
[9740.36s -> 9742.04s]  gg
[9742.04s -> 9744.92s]  I'm gg macaroon. Haven't you heard of me?
[9748.04s -> 9749.36s]  um
[9749.36s -> 9751.36s]  Not even your own grandmother knows who you are
[9752.16s -> 9756.37s]  Yes, uh, uh, yeah, I don't know whatever go away now shoe
[9758.31s -> 9787.33s]  The e-sports bar what can I do in here? Let's just start push-ups drink a coffee. I couldn't even get it refreshing
[9811.84s -> 9831.67s]  What do you got a burrito mom, which I can't buy any of this stuff. I need to save money
[9839.78s -> 9860.90s]  What is an e-sports bar? I don't know. All right. I need I need to whiz i'm looking for pewdiepie, right?
[9861.14s -> 9868.74s]  Isn't that what I'm supposed to be looking for pewdiepie. It's like find him downtown. Is this technically downtown?
[9869.06s -> 9888.31s]  It's a different city the pewdiepie there he is. Oh my god, it's pewdiepie and his little dog
[9888.79s -> 9896.96s]  Maya, is there something better to endorse your work? Is this voice acted? Oh, that would be funny
[9896.96s -> 9902.00s]  But what endorse a very suspicious guy was offering access to cyberware this morning
[9902.00s -> 9907.75s]  People are going nuts about this and it looks really bad. Has he offered it to you?
[9911.83s -> 9913.91s]  Yes, but I need the support of a super youtuber
[9914.55s -> 9920.34s]  Yes, but I need the endorsement to access it this one. I have an idea
[9921.46s -> 9926.02s]  Take a signed photo of me so he sees we know each other and gives you access to the game
[9927.65s -> 9932.37s]  Your drone will let me know when you have it. Let's go to your house. We'll record a video together
[9936.23s -> 9938.15s]  This is kind of just like
[9938.15s -> 9943.91s]  The dream I think of a lot of young people. I think that may have watched pewdiepie in the past maybe
[9944.63s -> 9945.67s]  where
[9945.67s -> 9951.33s]  Hey, let's make video at your house and your your camera and you play your game. This is kind of um
[9953.30s -> 9955.80s]  This is uh, well
[9955.88s -> 9958.04s]  This is a dream come true for a lot of people
[9961.56s -> 9962.52s]  Okay
[9962.52s -> 9966.84s]  Uh, Maya will take me to where you live. She's got an incredible sense of smell. What do you think your dog can?
[9967.80s -> 9972.60s]  Find my address by smelling
[9972.68s -> 9976.37s]  Imagine turning this down
[9976.37s -> 9979.17s]  No, no, no, no, no. Thanks. Not perhaps another time
[9980.95s -> 9984.07s]  Yes, come to open my place record the video great idea. We'll record at my house
[9991.22s -> 9995.54s]  I guess this is I guess we're doing this go and get the game. I'll be waiting for you at your house
[9996.10s -> 9999.35s]  It's not
[9999.35s -> 10001.35s]  This is all right. This is a weird picture
[10001.51s -> 10004.34s]  This is the picture that sits on like a gasket
[10005.96s -> 10008.84s]  What is this weird just framed photo with the thing in the back?
[10009.56s -> 10016.00s]  This is weird. I thought I was gonna get like a like a poster
[10016.64s -> 10022.28s]  I have to bring it to that guy
[10022.28s -> 10028.05s]  I don't even know where that guy was
[10028.05s -> 10043.32s]  He was in the other city, wasn't he? He's down at the port, right?
[10044.04s -> 10051.03s]  You have to take a picture with this. Oh my god
[10052.13s -> 10054.13s]  Oh, no, i'm just gonna stay up all night
[10054.21s -> 10059.72s]  Because I definitely have to take a picture with this. It looks like the portrait of a communist leader
[10060.52s -> 10080.20s]  I wonder how many youtubers are in this game or is it just pewdiepie?
[10080.28s -> 10085.83s]  You think they have is there a bunch of people in this game? I'm actually very curious. I'm very intrigued
[10086.23s -> 10099.33s]  Okay, look I have this take a look
[10100.58s -> 10101.54s]  See
[10101.54s -> 10106.04s]  Wow, what do you got there photo of pewdiepie himself? This really is an endorsement
[10108.13s -> 10110.13s]  It's is it really though
[10110.39s -> 10113.61s]  I mean you really deserve to try the game. Here's your cyberware
[10117.40s -> 10121.00s]  Searching for a famous youtuber completed. All right, cool. Did I get it?
[10121.80s -> 10124.42s]  I got it cyberware
[10124.50s -> 10137.25s]  Why is cyberware just watch cats? Is it the same game with a different? I don't get it. This is worth five thousand dollars
[10140.98s -> 10144.18s]  Run pewdiepie. Oh, I thought it was like pewdiepie is coming after me
[10145.41s -> 10147.41s]  Run pewdiepie is behind you
[10153.30s -> 10163.57s]  I this is good. I can't wait. This is gonna be so fun, but it's 10 o'clock. I don't have I don't think I can do it
[10168.10s -> 10182.26s]  Do not call pewdiepie at 5 a.m. Should that be the video we make but it's just he's actually just there
[10186.71s -> 10196.28s]  All right, I gotta go home quick. Is he just is he actually just gonna be in the house?
[10200.02s -> 10203.86s]  Oh my god, you got the game. I'm wondering what we'll find when we play let's record that video
[10205.72s -> 10206.52s]  All right
[10206.52s -> 10213.27s]  I feel like I would want to clean my whole house four times before he came over. You know what I mean? Like
[10219.20s -> 10223.49s]  Okay, record video
[10223.49s -> 10237.70s]  Watch cats. No, I don't have it. Oh, yeah, I do it is the same game. Okay cyberware
[10240.58s -> 10248.37s]  Is he gonna be in the video? I switched the camera to make sure that pewdiepie is in the frame running out of energy
[10248.69s -> 10270.45s]  All right, come on gameplay you start and is pewdiepie's watching me make this video you greet the channel
[10270.85s -> 10276.50s]  There's a lot of pressure here while the game loads you
[10277.22s -> 10284.18s]  You make a technical comment. Oh, there's a graphics glitch gotta laugh it up
[10287.88s -> 10289.40s]  to finish
[10289.40s -> 10293.40s]  You sign off. That's a five-star video and I did that in front of pewdiepie
[10299.01s -> 10304.45s]  All right. Now here's where the funny part of us would come in pewdiepie says thanks a lot
[10304.53s -> 10306.18s]  I'll invoice you
[10306.18s -> 10310.84s]  And there's an invoice in the mailbox in like a month or two. That's like five grand
[10315.28s -> 10318.88s]  Does pewdiepie help me edit it? This game is so boring. Is this the hit game?
[10318.88s -> 10326.93s]  Everyone's talking about it's so short and there's nothing to do. Oh, wait, you got a strange message on insta life
[10327.49s -> 10335.60s]  This is very shady. Pewdiepie is a whiz with videos. He'll know what we should do. Pewdiepie. What do we do?
[10336.32s -> 10341.35s]  Pewdiepie is a top video maker. He will know what to do. What do we do?
[10343.17s -> 10344.37s]  If you recorded the video yet
[10344.37s -> 10349.41s]  I haven't told you the most interesting bit about all this if you send a stream of messages to all your contacts
[10349.65s -> 10360.64s]  Praising this amazing game will give you a hundred coins. I don't have any contacts. So this is perfect. Yes, i'll do it
[10360.88s -> 10372.92s]  I don't have one person in my phone. Sure. Let's go. Thank i'll do it immediately. Your face looks full of questions
[10373.32s -> 10380.28s]  Shoot, how may I help the salesman asked us to spam? They'll give us a hundred coins if we spam our fans
[10381.75s -> 10385.67s]  I knew it. They want to promote a crappy product by using youtubers who take cheap bribes
[10385.99s -> 10391.03s]  You have to enter the message thread so that with your talent as a youtuber you can report the scam
[10392.26s -> 10395.46s]  First we have to catch this sales guy wherever he is. Do you know where to look?
[10395.70s -> 10406.07s]  It's probably in the port neighborhood almost but not quite. Maya has tracked down the salesman and he is downtown
[10406.39s -> 10412.60s]  Okay, we'll catch the scammer. You'll see I have to go and look for Maya first, but i'll see you there
[10412.92s -> 10426.23s]  Oh, I do. Wait, I added all these people in my phone
[10426.63s -> 10445.64s]  I don't remember getting all these people's numbers. All right. I want to see if there's any youtubers here. Come on
[10445.96s -> 10460.08s]  There are definitely other youtubers hidden in here. We have to find them. Okay, uh, it seems
[10461.78s -> 10470.12s]  Like Maya found the salesman in an alleyway with stairs. I have to go to sleep man. It's two o'clock in the morning
[10470.52s -> 10485.72s]  Did I not upload the video with pewdiepie? I didn't upload it
[10488.13s -> 10490.87s]  Oh Clara's trending
[10490.87s -> 10501.73s]  Suspected of being a werewolf. What's that? Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a new photo of my favorite favorite influencer
[10502.45s -> 10505.17s]  You have an internal monologue with doge
[10506.77s -> 10509.97s]  All right. Hold on. I need to I have that video man. It's gonna be worth a lot
[10510.53s -> 10526.55s]  Let's go out here. That's pretty good. Okay, so pewdiepie's here. He's blocked out
[10528.20s -> 10556.16s]  Why did he cut his face out? Is he not even in the video? I feel like that's enough, right? That's that's enough
[10556.48s -> 10574.07s]  I don't need anything else. All right, almost broke 100. What why is pewdiepie not on there? What's going on?
[10576.28s -> 10579.38s]  What he wasn't even in the video?
[10583.09s -> 10587.57s]  Wait, I swear he was in my house. I swear to god. He was in my house. He was in my living room
[10588.55s -> 10591.19s]  Okay. Yeah, pewdiepie came pew you tell you telling me
[10591.75s -> 10597.59s]  That pewdiepie met you on the street gave you a signed picture of his face to use as a currency to get a scam
[10597.67s -> 10601.99s]  Video game so he could come over your house and make a video and now you're on a detective adventure with him
[10601.99s -> 10603.89s]  Is that what you're saying to me?
[10603.89s -> 10605.00s]  Yes

[13450.61s -> 13457.27s]  All right, I still have a little bit of time to put that video up

[13472.00s -> 13473.96s]  Are you a developer?
[13473.96s -> 13478.76s]  Hi, i'm stewart lee the designer of spider bro. I'm presenting it two days before it goes on sale
[13480.00s -> 13482.56s]  If you want to try it out, you'll have to live stream it on the console
[13482.64s -> 13484.64s]  Do you know how to live stream? Of course I do
[13485.83s -> 13490.55s]  Well, I don't think your drone has the streaming function. So why don't you go over to the console and give it a try?
[13491.19s -> 13494.00s]  And i'll explain how you can install this function
[13495.09s -> 13496.63s]  streaming
[13496.63s -> 13499.91s]  Go over to the console and try it out and then i'll explain how you can install this function on your drone
[13500.55s -> 13506.26s]  Okay developer day spider bro

[13522.84s -> 13524.84s]  How is that? How many people is that actually?
[13529.99s -> 13554.20s]  That's insane
[13554.20s -> 13561.78s]  What the fuck is going on? Oh, okay. I'm good. Is this what it's like to stream?
[13563.54s -> 13566.10s]  um
[13566.10s -> 13568.10s]  Sometimes it can feel like that
[13568.42s -> 13575.25s]  I should just stream again
[13575.25s -> 13579.73s]  Yeah, that was 150. It's way better than new tube. Let's go
[13597.38s -> 13601.06s]  And I get access to the game early i'm gonna do this as many times as I can before I pass out
[13619.04s -> 13627.88s]  All right. Good. Hell. Yeah, 150 dollars save that one too. I'm gonna upload like five of these videos. They're super funny
[13630.88s -> 13642.50s]  Eat a bunch of takeout do it again. No space available
[13645.06s -> 13653.38s]  Okay, whatever. Can I get a selfie with you developer day?
[13677.83s -> 13702.82s]  All right, I got that now I gotta turn the videos in oh i'm running out of time seven hours what are your thoughts on um,
[13703.86s -> 13710.10s]  Even more. I don't know what that is. I refuse to even say it out loud talk to the dev I did. Oh shit
[13710.50s -> 13721.00s]  I just played the game and left that's rude. You're right, but they're closed now
[13722.56s -> 13727.36s]  They closed three hours ago and I was still in there exclusive. Come on. I'm a tuber. I get exclusive, uh access
[13727.68s -> 13749.09s]  I got three videos to make i'm gonna be pulling it all nighter on this one. All right edit video
[13750.87s -> 13765.65s]  I have the streams the vlog in front of the fountain. Let's get that one done now. Are you kidding me?
[13771.59s -> 13782.45s]  Are you serious? I don't care. This is like a sponsored video. Do I like this? This guy paid me to make this
[13782.45s -> 13814.98s]  I don't care. All right, they liked it. I'll take my I got 1200 bucks now. I could probably buy something
[13816.85s -> 13828.66s]  All right, let's go again. I still have a takeout pulling an all-nighter here. Come on. Let's go. This was a better
[13828.66s -> 13841.24s]  This was the best stream. This was the developer day. This is trending. This is huge. Um, none of these fit together
[13859.16s -> 13865.60s]  When is second david gonna come up? Whatever it's trending
[13865.84s -> 13908.12s]  Yeah, I gotta get my hands in there the biggest game stream pro of adventure. Come on more good
[13908.44s -> 13919.01s]  When is david craft someday soon? All right, I have two of those I put it together. Do I have enough energy?
[13921.36s -> 13930.29s]  Damn it. All right, let's go to bed wake up 1k 2k
[13931.43s -> 13939.72s]  2k 3k come on buy some better editing. That's not a bad idea. We'll try that now
[13939.88s -> 13951.67s]  Did one of those get copyright claimed you have to buy live streaming function in ertech
[13951.91s -> 13965.25s]  Okay, something you would have already solved if you'd gone streaming with steward lee yesterday, but who am I to judge didn't I what?
[13965.73s -> 13970.13s]  I did i'm editing the videos from those streams. What are you talking about?
[13970.71s -> 13988.48s]  Yeah, what install editor increase the score for the clip complete all output connections complete all input
[13988.56s -> 13999.99s]  Connections increase the editor that was a thou that was a thousand bucks. It's gone. Is it gone?
[14000.63s -> 14019.22s]  What's happening right now?
[14019.22s -> 14023.22s]  Okay, this is really confusing. All right, so put you can put it on each individual clip
[14023.30s -> 14033.51s]  You only have a certain amount of render points. I get it so I can do it to one we'll do to this one
[14037.57s -> 14038.37s]  Okay
[14038.37s -> 14051.24s]  Publish developer day secrets revealed fun. Honey play studios one the end will make you roll on the floor laughing. Sure
[14061.80s -> 14068.84s]  Now I will go buy a shirt, but I already okay. I guess we didn't do this
[14069.32s -> 14073.99s]  You're so epic and you're my best friend
[14075.80s -> 14076.68s]  um
[14076.68s -> 14091.84s]  I don't really know who you are, but thanks for watching. That was a bot. It was not a bot
[14098.55s -> 14100.55s]  That was not a bot talking
[14104.74s -> 14108.66s]  I told you we're we're all just a collective group of people hanging out having fun
[14109.22s -> 14117.14s]  Did you get it? That's how it works. I can't live stream here because the person's not here anymore
[14117.14s -> 14126.00s]  So how am I supposed to do this?
[14126.00s -> 14128.00s]  Find the er
[14137.68s -> 14138.80s]  Er
[14138.80s -> 14150.18s]  What this is not that much views I got like 3k yesterday. What's going on here? Where's that er tech place other side of town?
[14152.13s -> 14156.13s]  Yeah, all right. Let's go get some clothes at least a t-shirt
[14175.56s -> 14177.56s]  magic pixels t-shirt
[14179.94s -> 14196.53s]  Emoji shirt salamander sweatshirt. How about the emoji shirt? Yeah, put it on everybody put it on
[14196.93s -> 14203.94s]  What does this immortal snail I keep saying? Oh the immortal snail the immortal snail dude. I don't know
[14205.17s -> 14216.69s]  What's the immortal snail? It's a tick tock thing. Okay
[14217.25s -> 14242.26s]  Spider bro still a thing. How is that not a thing? All right, I need to go this way
[14247.62s -> 14251.46s]  Uh, you and a snail both get immortality and a million dollars
[14251.86s -> 14259.43s]  But the snail is always coming wait, but the snail is always coming towards you and if it touches you you die
[14262.92s -> 14264.68s]  I can't
[14264.68s -> 14269.35s]  I can't crush. I can't like just kill the snail. The snail is immortal
[14269.59s -> 14278.48s]  If I touch it with anything it kills me
[14278.48s -> 14285.76s]  Well what you would have to just kind of just hire a bunch of scientists to come up with how long it would actually take
[14285.76s -> 14288.00s]  the snail to
[14288.56s -> 14291.52s]  Go from one coast of the united states to the other coast
[14293.43s -> 14295.43s]  And I mean that that's a very simple question
[14296.42s -> 14299.22s]  to answer because what you would do
[14299.30s -> 14306.13s]  Is if you had a million dollars, right? I get a million bucks. I would just buy or rent two properties at the same time
[14306.77s -> 14307.96s]  one
[14307.96s -> 14313.64s]  in california and one in like florida or massachusetts or like maine or something, right?
[14314.28s -> 14317.00s]  And we would determine how long it took the snail to go back and forth
[14317.56s -> 14320.53s]  and let's say it was like
[14320.61s -> 14322.23s]  20 years
[14322.23s -> 14325.83s]  It's going to be like 10 to 20 years of the snail maybe more for the snail to do that
[14326.55s -> 14329.11s]  So you would just go live in your in your california house
[14329.75s -> 14331.19s]  For 10 years
[14331.19s -> 14335.51s]  And then once it became like eight and a half years just to make sure you got it right or make about nine years
[14335.91s -> 14340.84s]  You just go live in the other house for like two three years like 20 years. You would just keep going back and forth
[14348.00s -> 14349.12s]  That's easy
[14349.12s -> 14355.67s]  It would probably take a snail 30 plus years to go that far whenever you sleep
[14355.67s -> 14360.56s]  You don't dream you just see whatever the snail sees at that time. Well, that would be awful
[14365.01s -> 14369.41s]  One million is not enough for that
[14369.41s -> 14373.17s]  I wouldn't buy a house in california. Then I don't know somewhere cheaper
[14373.57s -> 14380.32s]  Just put it in a box. Well, it could get out of the box if I if you go across the whole country
[14380.64s -> 14382.80s]  There's no way a snail can find you that fast
[14383.44s -> 14390.13s]  What have you got on a plane?
[14390.13s -> 14395.49s]  Does the snail have intelligence or is this just a snail just walks in a straight line across the continent of the united states?
[14398.61s -> 14405.09s]  Does the snail have intelligence? It knows it knows to like get on a plane and go on somebody's luggage and get on the plane from
[14406.05s -> 14416.64s]  Boston to la does it have that intelligence it is. Yes. Okay, it's hyper intelligent. Um
[14417.28s -> 14424.23s]  Okay
[14424.23s -> 14426.23s]  And in that case, I would just probably
[14426.74s -> 14431.06s]  I don't know hire you can have a million dollars. So I would hire somebody to be at every entrance in my house
[14432.90s -> 14434.95s]  Or wherever it was
[14434.95s -> 14438.93s]  And just to stay there and if they see a snail it doesn't kill them, right?
[14439.09s -> 14442.10s]  So they would just pick it up and get on a plane
[14442.18s -> 14452.52s]  Why don't they just pick it up and put it like keep it as a pet or something pause the game?
[14452.52s -> 14455.49s]  Oh shit, whatever
[14455.49s -> 14458.53s]  Can you keep okay? What if you like get a box? That's a glass
[14459.17s -> 14460.56s]  box
[14460.56s -> 14462.56s]  and you put lettuce and
[14462.64s -> 14467.68s]  A little uh enclosure and it's nice and comfortable big enough where it's comfortable and you'll just keep the snail in there
[14470.68s -> 14479.38s]  That's why would that be hard?
[14479.38s -> 14483.81s]  Nine to nine shit. All right. Well now I can't do anything
[14484.37s -> 14493.35s]  Because I still said it's doing nothing put down a salt circle
[14495.59s -> 14514.37s]  Well that that no because it's it's an immortal snail. That's not gonna work cover the snail in concrete
[14517.62s -> 14522.34s]  Yeah, but you know, I don't know. I feel like you'd have to put it in concrete put it in the ground
[14522.82s -> 14527.35s]  All right. I'm just walking back and forth. I'm not doing anything. I need to go back to the house
[14527.99s -> 14539.99s]  Yeah, is it immortal or invincible? That's a good question. Where's my fucking house?
[14550.95s -> 14552.71s]  I don't think that would be hard to do
[14552.71s -> 14556.92s]  Especially considering that I would just set up motion detectors
[14558.42s -> 14561.73s]  In the house, right?
[14561.73s -> 14564.61s]  So it would sense any movement at all in any of the rooms
[14564.69s -> 14567.25s]  So I would be awoken by like an alarm sound
[14568.20s -> 14584.96s]  And if I see the snail just slowly coming towards me i'm i'm gonna the area is it's too slow to get noticed
[14593.00s -> 14603.40s]  Just do the tick tock video already. What does that mean? Does that mean?
[14604.37s -> 14612.00s]  Have the lady talk for the first five seconds. How would you deal with a snail coming at you?
[14614.13s -> 14615.89s]  Seems to be a huge threat in newtube city

[14629.60s -> 14631.36s]  Don't check your messages
[14631.36s -> 14639.97s]  Beware i'm near the fisherman and the tide has risen so high the pier is in danger

[14671.48s -> 14673.48s]  This hits the snail
[14673.48s -> 14675.88s]  What about craner? It's the most popular. What is craner?
[14678.34s -> 14682.44s]  All right. I need to go down

[14726.02s -> 14753.12s]  All right, the fisherman what the hell is going on down here tide is coming in. It doesn't look like it. I don't get it
[14764.31s -> 14766.31s]  You're doing a hurricane vlog

[14832.79s -> 14836.07s]  If you record a video with him, it might help him recover his memory this way
[14836.39s -> 14839.03s]  He will be able to tell us what happened to the tide this morning

[14862.45s -> 14864.76s]  Your phone rings you can't get any peace
[14866.37s -> 14867.97s]  I mean, I would say

[16981.40s -> 16995.83s]  Nope. Nope. It's probably in the I don't know. Is it easy vote for worst dream? I don't know. What are you talking about?
[16996.15s -> 17000.52s]  I just burped really hard down in my deep in my body. What are you?
[17003.24s -> 17006.36s]  And we already went over this
[17006.36s -> 17009.24s]  You can't know worst stream does not mean I don't like the game
[17014.77s -> 17025.25s]  Yeah, there I could name you probably three or four streams this year. That were way worse. I'm having fun
[17025.49s -> 17030.69s]  I'm having a good time having a blast. Actually, this is actually really fun. I'm having a ton of fun
[17031.17s -> 17033.41s]  How dare you by the way, how dare you?
[17038.95s -> 17040.95s]  All right. Where am I? Where am I going?
[17042.13s -> 17053.17s]  I have the console. I need to find a dancing competition. I would imagine that would be right in the middle of downtown
[17053.65s -> 17060.15s]  This is a dancing competition out here. This looks like dancing
[17061.38s -> 17063.46s]  It's not it doesn't look like a competition to me
[17064.18s -> 17073.27s]  Oh, I don't even care. I'm just gonna make the video
[17077.09s -> 17084.52s]  Dollhouse streams are worse than this
[17089.35s -> 17094.42s]  All right. I have the console. Let's do it. Take that down
[17095.43s -> 17104.58s]  One two, let's go. We're doing a gameplay video of silent the raccoon
[17104.98s -> 17121.28s]  See if we can get this trending let out a whoa find a bug make a technical comment about the bug
[17122.36s -> 17135.40s]  Why is this not filling up at all? This is literally a zero video one star video. Why is this filling so slowly?
[17138.36s -> 17191.22s]  Serious, it's too many cuts. This is gonna be demonetized. I just won't use that one. Whatever just click bait
[17191.30s -> 17202.64s]  Who cares if I ever okay 150 dislikes?
[17204.61s -> 17208.93s]  That's just that's that was all I thought that was really bad when I was making youtube videos
[17212.69s -> 17218.12s]  If a video had more than one to two hundred dislikes because there was always going to be
[17219.92s -> 17224.96s]  30 to 50 guaranteed dislikes no matter what it was nothing I could do about it
[17224.96s -> 17231.14s]  It was just guaranteed right but if a video had more than 150 dislikes 200 dislikes
[17232.16s -> 17238.69s]  That means that there were people that actually really did not like that video and whenever I would see that happen
[17238.69s -> 17242.29s]  I would have an internal crisis where I sit there and be like what the fuck did I do wrong?
[17242.53s -> 17245.44s]  What do I need? What do I do to fix this? That was was it bad?
[17247.04s -> 17258.47s]  Maybe i'll do another video tomorrow and make up for it. Thank god. You can't dislike a stream. Thank goodness
[17258.79s -> 17281.35s]  All right, the conventions today at 6k views though. Finally player one

[17292.24s -> 17296.80s]  And it was more fun than watching you do a gameplay buddy. The same person is just seriously like leave me alone
[17297.12s -> 17301.72s]  What did I do to you? Like what the hell it's the buddy

[17833.75s -> 17850.05s]  Wait, no, fuck doing an interview now. We're gonna go do a tutorial on
[17851.64s -> 17871.11s]  That trending game and that was 500 coins. It was way too expensive five hours
[17874.21s -> 17879.78s]  So the plan is don't let me let me get like the the plan going up here into halloween. So here's what we're gonna do
[17880.26s -> 17886.13s]  so tomorrow, uh italics night we're talking about playing that, uh
[17886.61s -> 17891.89s]  Manamadan game we were like this a couple things we were thinking about playing but that's one of them on the list
[17892.29s -> 17894.85s]  Either that or something else. We'll figure it out
[17894.93s -> 17896.93s]  Uh, there is one
[17897.68s -> 17903.08s]  Scenario where there might not be a stream tomorrow and i'm gonna give you it's like probably like a five percent chance
[17903.76s -> 17906.78s]  I'll tell you what it is. I just started taking an antibiotic
[17909.14s -> 17914.15s]  And I I don't know if it's gonna make me feel like shit. We'll find out but we'll see
[17915.28s -> 17917.73s]  so um
[17917.73s -> 17922.12s]  It hates streaming. It's a 100 chance. No
[17923.62s -> 17928.18s]  All right plan on there being no stream tomorrow because when there is I get to say there was one
[17928.26s -> 17933.59s]  Okay, do not mix it with avocados. I'm not eating avocados. What are you talking about?
[17935.59s -> 17944.10s]  But anyways darkest dungeon 2 comes out like in a couple days. I'm gonna play that on friday and then saturday
[17944.95s -> 17947.11s]  We're gonna do public domain movie night 2
[17948.87s -> 17957.44s]  Day before halloween. So there's probably gonna be a stream tomorrow me and italics gonna play something. We'll see again
[17957.76s -> 17963.27s]  I'm on an antibiotic last time I took an antibiotic. I had diarrhea and i'm just telling you let's be honest
[17963.27s -> 17979.56s]  I don't care how many people are here watching. I'm very honest incredibly honest person. How much longer you think I should scream?
[17979.56s -> 17983.65s]  I'm
[17983.65s -> 17988.29s]  Why am I asking you that why am I asking let me get to top 50 let me get to top 50
[17988.77s -> 18002.13s]  I don't know why I thought that was so funny
[18002.59s -> 18011.38s]  Nintendo next when I get to top 50 youtuber i'm done checking out insta life and seeing that you posted a new photo
[18011.38s -> 18017.40s]  Is the best you're too good 100. Hey, thanks. I got some footage to edit
[18017.96s -> 18031.73s]  No, just throw this one away
[18031.73s -> 18035.49s]  Just toss this video the smoke coming from your computer. This doesn't look good
[18036.53s -> 18053.89s]  You should change that part to continue using the computer what i'm done. See you guys probably tomorrow. See you guys tomorrow. Have a great night
[18062.10s -> 18064.45s]  30 90
[18064.45s -> 18070.12s]  No, actually, it's been pretty good so far. Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow
[18070.28s -> 18074.14s]  Look if there's an event where I have to not stream because i'm stupid antibiotic
[18074.68s -> 18077.64s]  And that's what's gonna happen, but it's planned for tomorrow. We're gonna do something tomorrow
[18078.12s -> 18088.00s]  Keep an eye on the sus tomorrow. I think that's pretty much all I want out of this game. It was fun. It means you're too weak
[18089.40s -> 18092.72s]  No, i'm not too weak. I had a good time. I thought that was actually really funny
[18095.22s -> 18105.52s]  Why are your streams not in 1080p? Well, that's a bit rate. Not enough. Yep twitch
[18106.39s -> 18121.54s]  Yep, that's why you should eat yogurt or take a probiotic to help with diarrhea
[18122.92s -> 18138.64s]  Uh, yeah, actually have a probiotic. That wasn't a sarcastic. Yeah, that was a yeah. I have a probiotic in right here
[18139.36s -> 18142.98s]  Not right here. That makes it sound like I made that up. There's a probiotic I have
[18143.70s -> 18148.68s]  Available to me that i'm taking are these old people problems?
[18151.20s -> 18157.25s]  Well, they're currently me problems right now because I don't know if you guys remember before the dollhouse stream
[18157.57s -> 18160.13s]  I want some streamer insight here before we go
[18161.12s -> 18162.58s]  um
[18162.58s -> 18167.36s]  the day before I had to get on the plane I
[18169.06s -> 18172.36s]  Had to get an MRI of my brain. It was incredibly stressful
[18172.92s -> 18174.42s]  because I had
[18174.42s -> 18175.62s]  this weird
[18175.62s -> 18177.44s]  pressure in my head
[18177.44s -> 18179.28s]  And I was really dizzy
[18179.28s -> 18181.28s]  I'm kind of like uneasy feeling
[18181.76s -> 18183.76s]  I talked about it a little bit when I came back
[18184.37s -> 18186.40s]  but
[18186.40s -> 18192.31s]  It was a really really awful thing to have happen right in the middle of that project
[18193.64s -> 18195.72s]  So that was a really really really
[18197.50s -> 18203.89s]  TLDR, but I don't want to get into it. Um, I have this problem with my sinuses. I have
[18204.61s -> 18206.21s]  cysts in my sinus
[18206.21s -> 18212.32s]  Yeah, I think they're in both of them. The max are we already talking about it, you know, so um
[18213.06s -> 18215.59s]  It looks like I have a little bit of an infection up there
[18215.59s -> 18219.35s]  So we're going to do an antibiotic for the infection and see if anything else has to happen
[18221.57s -> 18229.65s]  I am completely fine. By the way, like I'm fine. Don't worry. It's just an annoyance that happened a month or two ago
[18229.97s -> 18240.29s]  I'm good. Don't worry. I'm 100 fine and I'm not even sure if that's exactly what's going on
[18240.29s -> 18243.09s]  But that is what is being investigated now
[18244.61s -> 18249.41s]  So again, I'm completely fine. I'm 100 healthy right now
[18249.97s -> 18262.56s]  Don't worry. Thanks for the subs, by the way, that was a good time
[18263.34s -> 18265.04s]  youtubers life too
[18265.04s -> 18270.56s]  Currently on steam if you care we got to hang out with pewdiepie, which was that was pretty cool
[18271.36s -> 18279.68s]  Have a wonderful rest of your night. We'll see you probably tomorrow
[18280.32s -> 18369.41s]  Keep an eye on us
[18369.49s -> 18381.20s]  Right, it's monkey s didn't I run them. I thought yeah, I ran them. I did the credits
[18384.13s -> 18389.11s]  Yeah, I did
[18389.11s -> 18393.20s]  All right. This is part where I scream and then hit the end screen button. All right, let's try it
[18395.06s -> 18397.43s]  I really want to try to get cut off
[18397.43s -> 18399.43s]  If I can get cut off mid sentence or something
