[16.38s -> 21.21s]  I never left. I've been here for two fucking straight hours. Just listening.
[24.66s -> 38.28s]  I feel pretty good. Didn't move. Hey, welcome back everybody. Welcome back. Tell us the bad
[38.28s -> 42.12s]  news. What bad news? Did I tweet that under somebody? I always think I fucking do that,
[42.12s -> 60.20s]  I don't know why. I never left. How'd it go? It was good. It was good. He got brain fluid poisoning.
[60.20s -> 72.10s]  Yeah, we're gonna finish up this stream part two. I have probably an hour or two left of
[72.10s -> 76.90s]  Mega Man Legends and that's where we're gonna call it. I don't want to play this tomorrow.
[77.46s -> 83.24s]  Black and White 2 is tomorrow. Let's finish this today. Let's get this done. You know what I'm
[83.24s -> 95.24s]  saying? Why can I not connect to chat? I just had it. All right, hold on. Can I? Is everybody
[95.24s -> 112.10s]  else's chat messed? Everybody else's chat messed up? Can you see this? Well, I got you guys on
[112.10s -> 115.62s]  another monitor anyways. All right, I can see you guys now. I just can't see you in the window I
[115.62s -> 125.46s]  usually see you in. All right, so what we're doing, I had, I was doing, I got the final key
[126.58s -> 134.39s]  and then I saved it here. I beat the boss. Do the other games in the TV studio. I already aced the
[134.39s -> 138.71s]  other games in the TV studio. I got all the parts from it too. All right, what do I want to do?
[139.59s -> 143.86s]  Go get the red lipstick at the Apple market to give to the artist in Uptown.
[144.84s -> 162.17s]  You got it. That's, I need to go east and then south. Yeah, I didn't know if it was going to
[162.17s -> 168.89s]  take another hour or so, but it didn't. I'm back now. We can get this done now. All right,
[168.89s -> 177.90s]  I need to get to the Apple market. Now we go south. That's west. Was that north or west?
[178.70s -> 185.48s]  Yeah, I talked to the artist before. I said, I told the artist that they don't have any talent.
[185.48s -> 193.35s]  Is that bad? Does that lock me out? What about that, the pie, the race? All right, did it.
[193.91s -> 211.27s]  I aced it. You must have left early. I aced it. All right, who has red lipstick? You? Once this
[211.27s -> 218.36s]  is all up with, we'll give you a special deal. All the bread you can eat. Oh, there's a bakery.
[222.44s -> 240.12s]  Who has lipstick? Electric goods? Toy store? In here? Wait, why can't, get out of my way.
[240.76s -> 244.12s]  The grocer's wife still hasn't come back yet. I wonder if she's all right.
[248.54s -> 253.98s]  Sourdough lipstick. Mega Man, I'm frightened. Can you stay here and protect me? Oh, I know you've got
[253.98s -> 262.50s]  to protect everyone, not just me. You can see yourself in the mirror. Maybe not as handsome as
[262.50s -> 267.62s]  some, but it's a good looking face. You feel a little more confident after looking at yourself.
[268.18s -> 274.76s]  Plus two attack. Imagine. On second thought, I'll keep the clothes I got. I mean, after all,
[274.76s -> 278.44s]  they were present, right? I wouldn't want to hurt my boyfriend's feelings.
[283.61s -> 295.93s]  All right, nothing in here. Talk to the clerk. Stare into the mirror. Oh, Mega Man, I'm so
[295.93s -> 305.90s]  frightened. Where do I get the lipstick? In the electronics store. I see you got a VCR fridge.
[305.90s -> 320.30s]  How much is the lipstick? Right here? I'm praying to God and my dead husband to watch over you
[320.30s -> 340.49s]  and protect this island. It's supposed to be that cashier in hip bone. What the heck? I need to
[340.49s -> 344.01s]  talk to the painter. Didn't I already? Remember? I was like, you have no talent. Oh, I could really
[344.01s -> 357.03s]  use some red. And I was like, yeah, you could. Yeah, I did. I talked to the artist like two times.
[357.03s -> 375.42s]  Do it again. I guess we're doing it again. What are you saying? I have to try another. Okay.
[376.06s -> 400.97s]  He's actually back. Yeah. What do you think? I was lying. You think I wasn't going to come back?
[405.94s -> 410.50s]  Nah, guys. Hey, I'll be back in a couple hours, two or three hours. No, just I'm not coming back
[410.50s -> 414.82s]  and I'm not going to finish Mega Man Legends. It's going to go unfinished forever.
[423.29s -> 427.06s]  We already did this. Remember some talent, some red.
[439.13s -> 447.75s]  Now we go talk to cashier. What's my thoughts on PB&J sandwiches? Disgusting. Get rid of them.
[448.39s -> 452.71s]  Gross. Replace the jelly with fluff. And then you've got, now you've got a believer out of me.
[453.27s -> 475.02s]  PB&J. No, no, no, no, PB and fluff hog. Sorry. What? What is that? Really? I thought, I thought,
[475.02s -> 477.82s]  I thought jelly was, I thought people didn't like, I thought a jelly was a,
[481.03s -> 488.41s]  well, I actually, I did just say disgusting. Didn't I? Yeah. That's not fair. Hey, William,
[488.41s -> 494.09s]  thanks for the five community subs, William. I didn't rebuild. No, I haven't rebuilt anything.
[494.09s -> 501.64s]  I have. All right. Okay. I've got $76,000. Should I rebuild some stuff? I think it's time.
[502.36s -> 517.34s]  Where do I go to? City hall? Who rebuilds stuff? Rebuild the town. But that's money that I can't
[517.34s -> 524.25s]  spend on me. I know that sounds fucking horrible, but you know what I mean? I need to be able to,
[527.53s -> 537.10s]  artist is the museum lady. Oh, well, let's, first of all, let's go get the red lipstick.
[537.10s -> 567.19s]  That's priority number one. I will only gift to this stream. I will never subscribe myself
[567.19s -> 576.49s]  because your content is so far. What? Why would you pay more money to a stream that you don't like?
[577.13s -> 588.87s]  What? That was the most, that doesn't fit in any logic. It's a power play.
[590.07s -> 598.98s]  I don't really like this stream, but I'm going to pay extra money to it. Hi there, Mega Man. Are
[598.98s -> 604.02s]  you looking for something? Yes. Red chalk for drawing. I didn't know you were an artist.
[604.58s -> 614.02s]  We don't have any red chalk, but I've got some red lipstick. Yes, give it to me. I'll give you mine.
[615.22s -> 620.28s]  Hey, Super Bruce. Thanks for the five community subs. Thank you, Super Bruce.
[620.28s -> 630.47s]  Glad I can help you see you later. Okay, got lipstick. Let's go give lipstick to lady. Here
[630.47s -> 639.72s]  we go. That's right. Where's the hype train? I turned off hype train. They don't exist anymore.
[645.29s -> 665.91s]  I don't, they don't exist, but imagine subbing to Jerma. Can you imagine? What do I find? Downtown,
[665.91s -> 680.97s]  uptown, uptown is to the left. Downtown is to the right. Oh no, twist. Can you imagine giving this
[680.97s -> 690.12s]  guy any money? He's a fucking stupid fucking goddamn fucking idiot. All right. I got red
[690.12s -> 697.67s]  lipstick for you. I thought I was going to get hit by that car. No, if I got hit by a car,
[697.67s -> 710.34s]  I'd have to get 500,000 subs. Do you think I'm going to get hit by a car right now? Look what I
[710.34s -> 724.50s]  have. I feel like I'm watching something on TV that's designed for like a one-year-old.
[726.74s -> 731.70s]  The way that she's talking. That's exactly what it needed. Thank you so much.
[733.67s -> 740.90s]  Oh, would you look at the time? I better be going. Hey, don't get hit by the car.
[742.97s -> 755.54s]  Wait, what? What just happened? What did I do? I didn't, I didn't get anything for that. All
[755.54s -> 761.40s]  right. She's gone. So now go to the museum. The museum doesn't exist. I have to rebuild it.
[762.12s -> 775.77s]  So I have to go to city hall, right? So I got to go east, north. It's that building right here.
[776.58s -> 783.99s]  This one? Wait, this one right, right here? This is the museum? This is the museum. No, this is the
[783.99s -> 801.22s]  doctor's office. Come on with the green woof. Uh, sorry. That's, that's K-T-O-X-T-V. This one. Oh,
[801.22s -> 807.86s]  this is the one that was closed. Oh, so she works here now. Okay. So that's why she had to leave
[807.86s -> 814.28s]  because now she works here. Does this place have a door? I tried to go in here before and it was
[814.28s -> 826.90s]  like, sorry, we're closed. Good afternoon. Welcome to the catalogs art museum. The first floor has
[826.90s -> 836.36s]  our art gallery and the second floor is our exhibition hall. Please take your time and enjoy.
[842.17s -> 852.14s]  That painting was made almost 20 years ago. It's beautiful, isn't it? It's all right. It looks like
[852.14s -> 862.94s]  some thing out of an sci-fi movie, doesn't it? Yeah, it's all right. This painting was apparently
[862.94s -> 868.94s]  found in a ruin somewhere. It looks like a person wearing blue armor is fighting with a frightening
[868.94s -> 874.70s]  monster. I wonder what the thing that looks like an eye there is supposed to be symbolizing.
[878.66s -> 884.17s]  It's all right. What do you think about this? Doesn't it feel like this painting is trying
[884.17s -> 901.48s]  to tell us something? Is it a warning or a prediction? What is this? Fire in the streets?
[901.48s -> 908.47s]  This is a painting of the marketplace. Oh, I thought this was like lava destroying a town.
[911.43s -> 920.46s]  Oh, all right. That one, that's all right. I wonder what that is. I don't know for sure myself.
[921.10s -> 929.70s]  I don't know either. What is this? This is a, that's a picture of our home catalogs.
[929.70s -> 937.14s]  Island as seen from the air. Let's go upstairs. Do I have to pay for a ticket or can I just go
[937.14s -> 946.54s]  upstairs? You don't have to pay to go to a museum, do you? No. They're all free, aren't they?
[948.82s -> 962.15s]  Wait, hold on. Aren't all the museums and most of them are free? Yeah, depends. Oh, it's you.
[967.98s -> 969.10s]  You hanging it up downstairs?
[988.42s -> 990.18s]  Could you bring it here and show it to me?
[991.14s -> 993.86s]  Do I have anything interesting? If it's really good, I could display it here.
[994.90s -> 1002.49s]  You will? Great, thanks. I just got signed up. I just, all right, I just went to a gym on a trial
[1003.67s -> 1018.63s]  and now I go to this gym apparently. But there, it looks like a bone or something. Bone? Oh well,
[1018.63s -> 1024.63s]  a lot of the people who come here are into strange things like this. It doesn't look like much,
[1025.35s -> 1028.39s]  but is it a dinosaur bone? That's really cool. All right, I'll just play it.
[1031.03s -> 1036.07s]  You could call it a bone. How about you call it a, a bone from a living creature,
[1036.07s -> 1050.26s]  not ancient digging tool. I got more stuff.
[1060.42s -> 1061.46s]  No.
[1066.90s -> 1070.42s]  Maybe, hey, maybe you've seen some rich people. What do you think I got it?
[1071.90s -> 1079.40s]  If I have one of these, how come you don't put me in that category of rich person? I have one
[1079.40s -> 1083.16s]  in my pocket. Doesn't that mean I'm more rich that I'm carrying the fucking thing around?
[1084.12s -> 1089.56s]  Thank you so much. I bet there are a lot of people who'll come to see this.
[1093.24s -> 1101.80s]  Anything else? Oh, is that a crystal fossil? All right, you guys pay big bucks for this one.
[1102.52s -> 1106.84s]  Those are made when a weaver bot's body crystallizes over the centuries.
[1107.96s -> 1113.80s]  They're considered grade three national treasures. That's right. It would mean so much to me if you'd
[1113.80s -> 1123.99s]  let me display that here, please. Thank you so much. I bet there are a lot of people who'll
[1123.99s -> 1130.07s]  come to see this. I bet there are a lot of people. Okay, so do I have any more rare artifacts?
[1131.66s -> 1139.42s]  Where did you find that? That's an antique shield. Wait, is she taking all my stuff?
[1139.50s -> 1144.94s]  National treasures. Some weaver bot was probably using it to protect itself.
[1144.94s -> 1152.86s]  Is she taking my shields and shit? This is my equipment, isn't it? Is it? Thank you so much.
[1156.62s -> 1161.10s]  Oh, what's that you have on there? That blue armor looks really interesting. You found that.
[1161.10s -> 1169.34s]  Could I put it on display? You're a digger, right? If you find something interesting,
[1169.82s -> 1176.62s]  there are a lot of people. Bring it here and show me. I'll evaluate it for you and if it's
[1176.62s -> 1184.62s]  really nice, I'll put it on display here. This lady's talking into my soul. The way she's
[1184.62s -> 1198.18s]  talking is I can feel it. All right, what did I give? Don't you think this is just the loveliest
[1198.18s -> 1207.19s]  box? I really like these. Holy shit, you really were in desperate need of stuff. Look at this
[1207.19s -> 1214.79s]  cardboard box in the museum. Why is there a giant emerald? That's a beautiful diamond, isn't it?
[1214.79s -> 1226.82s]  It's one of my favorite displays. That's a diamond, yet you want me to pay for the town.
[1226.82s -> 1232.66s]  I have like $78,000. You have like $6 billion worth of diamond on the counter.
[1236.58s -> 1243.74s]  You can't like shave off a little bit of this. Ancient digging tool discovered in the
[1243.74s -> 1253.62s]  Cardan forest subgate. Appears to be made of animal bone. Cool. What about this? Giant horn,
[1253.62s -> 1258.42s]  believed to be the horn bang of an animal-shaped reaverbot, often found in rocky areas above ground.
[1260.65s -> 1264.57s]  Antique shield, grade two national treasure, apparently used by reaverbots for protection.
[1264.57s -> 1270.58s]  All right, this is my grade three. Grade three national treasure, fossilized remains of a dead
[1270.58s -> 1279.26s]  reaverbot. All right, what's this? That may look like any old rock, but it's really a rare and
[1279.26s -> 1290.26s]  valuable specimen. I'm missing some items? Oh well, we'll never get the end. Oh, that's cool.
[1294.49s -> 1305.74s]  Box and rock. Okay, so I got rid of some of those items. Now I need... why did I instinctively just
[1305.74s -> 1314.22s]  press triangle? Like I was going to get into the car. Third person, Grand Theft Auto, has just
[1314.22s -> 1322.41s]  changed everything. You see a car, you try to get in it with triangle. All right, so I need to rebuild
[1322.41s -> 1328.57s]  the town, so I gotta go to the town hall, right? City hall. Now, can you just drive me to city hall?
[1335.11s -> 1339.11s]  Mega Man gets into a car and drives to the grocery store ASMR.
[1343.70s -> 1362.81s]  Why ASMR? That's so stupid. All right, let's rebuild the town. I'll spend all my money. City hall.
[1363.53s -> 1381.80s]  Excuse me, I have an appointment. How much does it cost? Hello there, Mega Man. What can I do for you?
[1382.52s -> 1390.38s]  I'd like to make a donation. You will? Oh, thank you so much. I wonder where we should start. Well,
[1390.38s -> 1395.59s]  let's start with the residential houses. To complete the repairs to the residential houses,
[1395.59s -> 1405.10s]  we need an additional 18,000 zenny. How much do you want to donate? I'd like to give $18,000.
[1408.34s -> 1419.80s]  Thank you. This means so much to the island. I'd like to donate to bring back the condominium.
[1420.44s -> 1434.49s]  5,300 for the condominiums. What a weird number. 5,380. Oh no, I gave $20 like seven and a half
[1434.49s -> 1445.75s]  hours ago. I forgot. This means so much. All right, so how long does it take? Is that it? What can I
[1445.75s -> 1450.79s]  do for you? I'd like nothing, just came to see you. Oh my, why Mega Man? I'm happy to see you too.
[1451.43s -> 1466.70s]  I don't know quite what to say. Thank you. Okay, so did they do it? Does it take a while? Is this 20
[1466.70s -> 1482.89s]  year old video game logic? Are they just open? Let's go back to the market. I want to buy some
[1482.89s -> 1503.59s]  stuff. Do the poggers or the kappa face. I don't know what that one is, so I know how to do this one.
[1504.23s -> 1522.62s]  That's not kappa. How do you, what, somebody do it. What is it? I'm not doing it right. Somebody,
[1522.62s -> 1544.97s]  what is it? It's too small. I need to see it bigger. Is that right? It's kind of close.
[1550.07s -> 1557.48s]  Do the Jim Carrey Grinch face. I don't have like $40,000 of prosthetics on. I don't know what you
[1557.48s -> 1564.02s]  want from me. What are you talking about? All right, what do I need to do? I need to go to
[1564.02s -> 1579.11s]  the market. We're gonna buy a bunch of shit. Just hanging out with my 2,700 best friends
[1579.75s -> 1599.96s]  playing Mega Man Legends. We hate you. Parasocial relationship. What are you talking about? I'm here
[1599.96s -> 1619.38s]  with my best friends. Okay, defense. Extra pack. When does this max out? Shield repair. Repairs
[1619.38s -> 1631.74s]  damage life shield. Did I get another one? How many is this gonna have? Oh, buster unit, sniper
[1631.74s -> 1636.94s]  unit. All right, we're good. Now I have a ton of, let me make sure the canteen's refilled.
[1637.98s -> 1656.07s]  It's the Grinch face with no makeup. Holy shit. Oh my god. What the fuck? That's insane.
[1656.07s -> 1665.78s]  That's actually ridiculous. Oh my god. It's just his face. Is that, is he, all right, is that movie
[1665.78s -> 1683.50s]  any good? Show, I can't do that. Maybe I can. No, that's, that's like, I'm trying to like take a
[1683.50s -> 1697.42s]  shit in an airplane bathroom and I'm really anxious. That's what that was. Not even close.
[1697.82s -> 1737.45s]  I'm sorry. Who emoted? Hold on. I can't. That's just the, that's the bitter beer face from the
[1737.45s -> 1744.73s]  old beer commercials. Did you guys remember those commercials? The guy takes a sip out of the beer
[1744.73s -> 1750.41s]  and his face goes crazy. Just, all right, type in bitter beer face into YouTube and watch those
[1750.41s -> 1756.92s]  commercials. What, I don't even, I don't, okay, I know that joke, but I don't even know what beer it
[1756.92s -> 1769.46s]  was. No idea. Okay, let's pay attention for a second. I need to do, what is it, go to the
[1769.46s -> 1783.38s]  police station. Go to the police station and get a side quest. What's my favorite time zone?
[1785.21s -> 1797.74s]  The one that I currently live in because it's me existing in my own time. This one. I mean,
[1797.74s -> 1804.70s]  the one that I'm in. Why would I have a favorite time zone? Oh shit, I have to give 500,000 subs.
[1808.82s -> 1817.72s]  All right, let's go. Oh look, they're doing it. See, look, they're rebuilding everything. Look at
[1817.72s -> 1833.85s]  this. It's going to be a nice new town. You guys have to eat a Post-it note. No, I'm in the doctors
[1833.85s -> 1839.70s]  plenty enough. I'm not, I don't want to go in for anything else. All right, where's the police
[1839.70s -> 1858.30s]  station? Uptown? Is it Ikea houses? Where's the police? Where's the police? Where's the police?
[1858.30s -> 1866.12s]  Where's the police? Police. Hospital. Is it downtown? Did I miss it? Police. Police. Police.
[1867.37s -> 1884.33s]  Police. Downtown. Yeah, I gotta go back. And then north. That's two million dollars. That image is
[1884.33s -> 1889.69s]  not even, that image is just, I'm not even gonna put that on stream. That's just like, I bought an
[1889.69s -> 1895.37s]  iPad seven years ago and that's what I do with it every time I turn it on. That's what that image is.
[1896.09s -> 1931.74s]  Hounds rebuilding, yeah. All right, let's go. Police station. Oh, what the hell are you doing?
[1934.62s -> 1941.42s]  All right, I feel like, oh god, let's get the shit out of me. I feel like, I feel like sometimes
[1941.42s -> 1945.66s]  somebody will post an image in here and they just went into Photoshop and hit the random button
[1945.66s -> 1962.36s]  and then they just hit save in the paste as soon as possible. Is there a randomized button in
[1962.36s -> 1969.40s]  Photoshop? Why the hell wouldn't they have done that? They're losing out on a lot of potential
[1969.40s -> 1978.30s]  subscribers to Adobe Photoshop. Will it, you know, take care of all the weird stuff?
[1978.86s -> 1985.64s]  Give a job? I'm supposed to be out investigating everything that's been happening but I just can't
[1985.64s -> 1990.49s]  seem to get excited about work anymore. It's kind of, well, that's a little depressing, I guess.
[1991.21s -> 2001.83s]  Mega Man, isn't it? The inspector's inside. Go on in. All right, what do you got for me?
[2001.83s -> 2009.27s]  We kind of reached the end of our rope with this last disaster. Things haven't completely quieted
[2009.27s -> 2015.11s]  down yet, so we'll stay on alert status for a little while longer. When you have the time,
[2015.11s -> 2019.67s]  stop by and talk to us sometime. Never know when we might need your help again.
[2023.34s -> 2028.22s]  Oh, Mega Man, I was hoping you'd come by. There's something I'd like to ask your help with.
[2029.66s -> 2033.74s]  A little while ago, this little kid with a yellow face came up to me and told me that
[2034.30s -> 2040.06s]  he dropped something downtown. I didn't really understand what he said to me. He said he dropped
[2040.06s -> 2045.43s]  three things and that we'd all better run with something. I'm not sure what it all means,
[2045.99s -> 2050.07s]  but I've got a hunch something's not right. Could you go check things out for me? What?
[2050.95s -> 2064.74s]  Thanks and good luck. What the fuck are you talking about? Wait, say that again? Okay, so
[2065.78s -> 2078.71s]  this guy, he's planting, uh, all right. It's fucked up. All right, let's go. Yeah,
[2078.71s -> 2082.31s]  this kid just did a bomb threat. I didn't really get it though. Yeah, what the fuck is he talking
[2082.31s -> 2114.39s]  about? Uh, save before it's too late. I'm busy. What do you mean you're busy? What do you mean
[2114.39s -> 2159.11s]  you're busy? He's just shit faced. Yeah, that's just, that's a guy that's just really, really
[2159.11s -> 2167.74s]  drunk. It's too late to go back. Where are these are? Where are the bombs? I'm sorry. I was not
[2167.82s -> 2191.98s]  paying very much attention. I was like downtown. This is the bad end. Bad end. How much did you
[2191.98s -> 2195.90s]  pay for this copy of the game? Um, I don't think it was that expensive. I think it's pretty cheap
[2195.90s -> 2203.85s]  actually. A bomb. That must be what the inspector was talking about. You've got to find the other
[2203.85s -> 2215.16s]  two before they explode. Maybe if you can find someone who saw something. No. Did you see
[2215.16s -> 2221.03s]  something? What was that noise? It sounded like a bomb going off. Wait, that means that the thing I
[2221.03s -> 2229.46s]  saw over by the greenhouse must have been. Oh no. Okay, greenhouse. This is a greenhouse, right?
[2230.18s -> 2247.94s]  This is a greenhouse. Oh, this also is a greenhouse. Got it. You found a bomb. Mega Man,
[2247.94s -> 2256.74s]  here's the switch. There, now it's disarmed. Only one more. All right, we can find, excuse me,
[2256.74s -> 2271.61s]  anybody? Anybody? You. What do you see? You see something? Are you looking for something?
[2272.25s -> 2277.05s]  You know, I lost something myself recently. I was fixing a roof and I forgot my tools
[2277.05s -> 2283.13s]  on the roof of all places. Last place I thought of to look. Just goes to show you things are always
[2283.13s -> 2287.37s]  in the place you least expect to find them. Who knows? Maybe what you're looking for is on
[2287.37s -> 2291.05s]  somebody's roof. Is this the guy? Is this the, is this the person that put the bomb on the roof?
[2294.34s -> 2304.38s]  Why? That's very, very incredibly descriptive. All right, you get on the roof. But what roof?
[2304.94s -> 2328.42s]  There it is. Okay, it's on that roof. I see it. Okay, how do I get out? Can I jump? You. Is that it?
[2331.24s -> 2335.42s]  There's not, is there more than one? That's who? Didn't say there's one more. Is that it? Am I done?
[2336.14s -> 2352.84s]  The music's still going. There's three bombs and one blew up. So that's it, right? I can leave.
[2354.04s -> 2365.64s]  The music's still, I think that's good. All right, let's go back and talk to the inspector again.
[2376.89s -> 2385.16s]  I don't know, dude. I didn't play this game. Derma sucks at this game, though. Man, he sucks.
[2387.99s -> 2407.75s]  That's, why'd you have to say it twice? Just to make sure you saw. Just wait that way. Just wait
[2407.75s -> 2423.24s]  that way. Derma sucks. Thanks to the five community subs. I did what you asked. Oh, it's you,
[2423.24s -> 2428.52s]  Mega Man. I saw the report about the bombs. We're lucky you found them all. Before they went off,
[2428.52s -> 2439.67s]  you saved the city again. Thanks for helping us. We're counting on you. We're counting on you.
[2439.67s -> 2456.98s]  All right, done. You stink. I love that picture of him. Hey, Mega Man. I could use your help with
[2456.98s -> 2462.34s]  something. A man came to us saying he's lost the money he was going to use to build his house.
[2462.98s -> 2469.38s]  Poor fellow. I'd like you to see if you can find the bag this fellow dropped. The owner of the bag
[2469.38s -> 2485.72s]  is out there in the lobby. You should go talk to him. You drop a bag? Reverb bots in underground
[2485.72s -> 2494.10s]  cities? Oh, that's a little out of my league. Where are you? What'd you drop? Bustard man. Oh,
[2494.10s -> 2499.54s]  where could I have left it? I'm pretty sure I had it when I went to the electronic shop.
[2500.58s -> 2505.94s]  I've been saving for years so I could build my dream house too. Oh, what am I going to do?
[2506.74s -> 2536.86s]  Humans are animals. Yeah, that's true. Mammal to be exact. Yeah, we got a wink. I just saw it.
[2549.37s -> 2561.72s]  Give me a free soda. Do I have a beard? No, I just I can't grow a beard. This turns into weird,
[2561.72s -> 2570.60s]  gross strands of dark looking spaghetti on my face. All right, let's go to the
[2571.80s -> 2577.50s]  southern part. Why did I choose a wink as a thing? I don't know because
[2579.64s -> 2583.24s]  channel points came out and that day I was like, oh, it's just a wink. Who cares?
[2584.04s -> 2589.78s]  And now it's turned into the biggest mistake I've ever done on Twitch. This has to be the
[2589.78s -> 2599.64s]  biggest mistake I've done on YouTube and Twitch combined. All right, electronics. The junk shop.
[2609.45s -> 2619.08s]  Winx ruined his life. All right, what do you got? You left your bag here? Someone carrying a bag?
[2619.08s -> 2623.88s]  Yeah, I saw him. He said he had lots of money so I tried to get him to buy something but he didn't
[2623.88s -> 2629.16s]  buy anything. He said that it wasn't his money to spend. He left saying he wasn't going to get
[2629.96s -> 2651.22s]  something to eat. All right, so he went to the bakery. All right, he went to the bakery. Once
[2651.22s -> 2659.67s]  this is all over with, we'll give you a snow. All right, where did he go? Over here? There are tomatoes,
[2659.67s -> 2674.38s]  cucumbers, and other vegetables. That's a fake link. Is there another like a restaurant? Not a
[2674.38s -> 2683.19s]  real link. I can see them. So where did he get food? Over here at this meat shop? Welcome, huh?
[2683.19s -> 2688.07s]  Middle-aged man carrying a bag. Well, he bought some bread and then left saying he had something
[2688.07s -> 2693.75s]  to look up. I don't think a single piece of bread will be enough of a meal for a grown man.
[2694.47s -> 2711.54s]  Something he needed. Something he had to look up? Did he go to the library? Is there a library in
[2711.54s -> 2730.01s]  the game? Have I been in a library? What building is it? Downtown? I went to the museum. All right,
[2730.01s -> 2746.15s]  library. Is this a library? This looks like a library. All right, library. A man carrying a
[2746.15s -> 2750.87s]  bag. Yes, I saw him. He looked like he was having some kind of problem breathing. Like he had some
[2750.87s -> 2759.45s]  things stuck in his throat. Maybe he went looking for something to drink. What? Is there a bar?
[2760.25s -> 2780.81s]  Or should I... one of the vending machines? Check the vending machines. Okay, there's one here.
[2781.37s -> 2799.61s]  You got a soft drink. You just wasted your channel points? I'm sorry to hear that. Not that one.
[2800.57s -> 2827.69s]  He wanted a drink. He got a soft drink. You see anybody? A middle-aged man carrying a bag. Hmm.
[2828.33s -> 2834.98s]  Well, I did see a man who didn't look well buy some juice, but he didn't have a bag though. If
[2834.98s -> 2840.18s]  it's the same man, he must have lost it before coming here. Why don't you ask around? Don't you
[2840.18s -> 2845.70s]  watch detective stories? That's the first step of any investigation. Find suspects and question them.
[2856.09s -> 2864.31s]  So it was from the library to here. Boy, that old guy really made me angry. Get a license
[2864.31s -> 2872.38s]  and registration please. Saw him. He went running by real fast. Even ran into me. Kept on going
[2872.38s -> 2878.46s]  without even so much as a sorry. I was angry so I put the bag he dropped into a trash can.
[2878.46s -> 2891.46s]  Did he send you to look for it? Well, it's over there. Why don't you go get it? Bag. It's the killer.
[2893.82s -> 2896.30s]  All right, I got the bag. Back to the police station.
[2914.92s -> 2925.34s]  North. North. This song makes me want to pog. It's all good. That's a good thing.
[2927.85s -> 2931.75s]  How is it? Why is it a bad thing? Directionally challenged. Yes, I know.
[2933.02s -> 2940.44s]  I know. Blame the GPS system. Blame the invention of the GPS. We're all gonna be
[2940.44s -> 2949.61s]  fucked. Guys, even if I'm going down the street and I know exactly where I'm going, if I get in
[2949.61s -> 2958.14s]  my car... I know exactly where I'm going. GPS is just on. Just don't matter. It's just on.
[2958.14s -> 2972.46s]  All right, I got your bag. Where's the guy with the... I got a bag. Wait, why? I don't know.
[2972.46s -> 2989.22s]  What does he do? Why is he not in here? Oh, there you are. Wait, that bag. It looks like...
[2992.70s -> 2998.76s]  What? You found it? Oh, thank you so much. I was frightened to death thinking about what my wife
[2998.76s -> 3003.48s]  would do to me if she found out what had happened. As a reward, let me give you some of the money.
[3004.20s -> 3008.66s]  What did you say? You don't need any? Well, here, at least accept this as thanks from me.
[3010.31s -> 3019.18s]  Arm supporter. No, give... I'll take some money. I'm counting on you. All right, I did it. Arm
[3019.18s -> 3026.98s]  supporter. I got a lot of new items. Wait, did he say... Did he say, oh, here's some money? No, no,
[3026.98s -> 3033.42s]  wait. No, you actually... You don't need it. Or did I say, I don't need it? There's not much happening
[3033.42s -> 3050.79s]  right now. Okay. One more try. Not much happening. Is somebody sick in the hospital? Okay.
[3051.35s -> 3064.57s]  We'll go to the hospital. What's that? You say you don't need money? I'm going to use that at
[3064.57s -> 3080.78s]  the drive-through. And then the person will just very, very clearly say, sir, that'll be... That'll
[3080.78s -> 3091.26s]  be $8 and 20 cents. Please drive up. Sir, that'll be $8 and 20 cents. Please drive up. I thought I
[3091.26s -> 3105.21s]  had... I pressed the button. Yeah, you can't do omega lol minus two omega lol. Not counting.
[3105.21s -> 3120.63s]  You're laughing. I win. I win. All right, let's get the car. Now I'm quiet, am I? Not anymore.
[3121.03s -> 3138.36s]  Give me some development here. Plastic was used to make Power Blaster L versus your firing range,
[3138.36s -> 3148.78s]  but your firepower is well. The bomb was used to make Power Blaster R, heavy-duty combat,
[3149.50s -> 3160.28s]  versus both firepower and speed. Okay. That's it. One more development. Favorite fast food
[3160.28s -> 3168.25s]  restaurant. Oh, that's tricky. That's tricky. I don't know if I can answer that. All right.
[3169.13s -> 3178.04s]  Four attack. This is Omni Unit. Increases all abilities by one. Power Blaster R.
[3180.30s -> 3188.12s]  Now, these are not very good. Plus two, one, plus two, no. This shit I got is way better.
[3189.00s -> 3204.14s]  Plus three to both. What's my favorite fast food place? I mean, McDonald's is a really good...
[3204.78s -> 3212.47s]  McDonald's is a go-to. It's very, very... It's just, I know exactly what I like there.
[3214.86s -> 3219.10s]  I don't think McDonald's is the best fast food restaurant, but it's the one that it's pretty
[3219.10s -> 3240.84s]  easy to go to. I already did a tier list. Ash House or GoGo is not fast food. It's a sit-down
[3240.84s -> 3259.54s]  restaurant. Wendy's? No, I'll be honest. I got sick of Wendy's. I don't know. This is weird.
[3259.54s -> 3266.25s]  It's weird. I think Wendy's is a better... It's a better place than McDonald's. I think Wendy's is
[3266.25s -> 3271.85s]  better than McDonald's, but I got sick of Wendy's. I didn't get... Jesus, that scared the fucking shit
[3271.85s -> 3280.94s]  out of me. Stop! Who just ran me? Somebody just ran me over. I got kind of sick of Wendy's.
[3281.66s -> 3291.05s]  I don't know why, but I've not gotten sick of McDonald's. All right, let's go to the hospital.
[3291.05s -> 3309.29s]  Hospital's in uptown. I thought I could beat it. Uptown is west? Yes. No, it's south and then west.
[3310.01s -> 3338.20s]  All right, just drive. Just bring me there. I have access to a car. Is there a person on the roof?
[3338.84s -> 3344.57s]  Well, I don't know. Whatever. I'm going to the hospital. Somebody said there's a sick person
[3344.57s -> 3352.60s]  in the hospital. There's a side quest in here. That's where I'm going. How much longer of this
[3352.60s -> 3362.65s]  game? Until it's done and then I'm gonna be done streaming. This is the hospital. Okay, who's in
[3362.65s -> 3368.66s]  the hospital? You. We don't get many patients, actually. Everyone on the island's pretty healthy.
[3372.09s -> 3382.18s]  You. Am I? I actually don't know the answer to this question. Yeah.
[3407.98s -> 3417.03s]  All right, yeah. How do I do that? I feel like I've come down with a cold.
[3417.11s -> 3427.75s]  But I thought I'd have the doc take a look at me. All right, let's go. I gotta. Let's leave and come
[3427.75s -> 3452.76s]  back. In the hospital with a cold. Room 305. You know, I thought I would go to the hospital. I
[3452.76s -> 3467.86s]  have a stuffy nose. Am I? Did I make it? One of my patients is this darling little girl, but she's
[3467.86s -> 3472.98s]  very ill and has lost the ability to walk. If we just had some more modern equipment here, we could
[3472.98s -> 3478.50s]  probably cure her, but I just wish there was something I could do for her. I don't have any
[3478.50s -> 3494.63s]  equipment? Sure, but we don't have any equipment. Well, we're supposed to talk. I'm supposed to
[3494.63s -> 3525.45s]  tell her stories of my adventures. I don't have an item. I'm gonna go talk to the mayor. All right,
[3525.45s -> 3534.71s]  we'll go talk to the mayor. If only there was some person who could allocate funds to the city,
[3534.71s -> 3543.00s]  some sort of mayoral figure. I know, I just wanted to talk. I just wanted to talk for a sec.
[3544.50s -> 3551.29s]  All right, where's my special car? Take me to city hall. I'm gonna make this. I'm gonna make this
[3551.29s -> 3573.34s]  good. Kill the monkey. Why do you guys want me to kill the monkey? Can you use a funny voice changer
[3573.34s -> 3582.09s]  for the rest of the stream? I'll do this for you. I will pitch shift myself up one, one tab and see
[3582.09s -> 3590.36s]  if anybody realizes it as we play. Like this. Sorry, like this. Okay, so I'm pitch shifted up
[3590.36s -> 3600.14s]  one tiny bit and I'm gonna tell everybody I got a new microphone. Is this too noticeable?
[3601.35s -> 3613.75s]  Is it? Is this too noticeable? No, it's not. You can't hear it at all. Not at all. How about that?
[3615.59s -> 3620.07s]  You tell me when it gets to be too like, like absolutely he's fucking around and he's making
[3620.07s -> 3625.19s]  a joke. At that point, no. Like, oh wow, this is funny. He's like on a voice change run. Is
[3625.19s -> 3639.80s]  that way there now? Go back? Don't go so too far. Okay. So how's this? Is this better? Right here?
[3640.36s -> 3651.32s]  A little bit more. This is perfect. I'll actually heal him. What if I do this? How does this sound?
[3651.32s -> 3660.82s]  This is going to be a little bit different. Should I go more? Like over here? Or back? No,
[3660.82s -> 3666.47s]  I can't. I don't know what it sounds like. I have no idea what this sounds like. A little more? No,
[3666.47s -> 3681.59s]  lower? All right. How's that? Right here? Right there? That sounds all right, doesn't it? Right
[3681.59s -> 3688.25s]  here. Right here. Higher. Too low? No, no, no. I think it's all right. Is this any different from
[3688.25s -> 3696.68s]  the normal mic? All right. I'll show you what the difference is. Uh, A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
[3696.68s -> 3710.49s]  A, B, C, D, E, F, G. A, B, C, D, E, F, G. That sounds the same. That's the same. Exactly the same.
[3710.49s -> 3721.78s]  No way. A, B, C, D. A, B, C, D. People think the speakers are broken? How could there be no
[3721.78s -> 3733.29s]  difference? I don't understand how it could be. I don't really like get it. Usually I can get this
[3733.29s -> 3755.37s]  off pretty quickly. I have to do that like once a week. I'm sorry. Somebody, okay, person on the
[3755.37s -> 3763.78s]  roof. Who the fuck is on the roof? I don't see anybody on a roof. What are you talking about?
[3768.52s -> 3772.60s]  I mean, if you give me access to instant bugleberry, I'm going to use it like at least
[3772.60s -> 3783.06s]  once every couple of weeks. Somebody's on the roof of the hospital. What? Are you serious?
[3793.70s -> 3798.79s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Where is this person? This person on the roof of the city hall?
[3799.59s -> 3815.18s]  I don't see anybody up here. To the left of city hall. There is no left of city hall. That is city
[3815.18s -> 3835.82s]  hall, isn't it? There's nobody on a roof. What are you talking about? There ain't nobody on a roof.
[3864.41s -> 3872.70s]  Shit, I jumped. I thought you guys were bullshitting me. Why would I think there'd
[3872.70s -> 3878.86s]  be somebody walking around on a roof? I'd love to climb the main gate, but I'm sure the police
[3878.86s -> 3890.81s]  would stop me. Yeah, this was a real good quest. There's a wink. Worst fucking thing I've ever done
[3890.81s -> 3904.09s]  in my life is put that on. Okay. City, we've got a city hall. City hall. We got to go to city hall.
[3911.06s -> 3916.87s]  Remove it. No, I'm gonna, don't worry. I'm going to give you a date for when it's going to get
[3916.87s -> 3923.62s]  removed. Imagine paying 75,000 points and getting a half-assed wink. I know. It's,
[3924.42s -> 3935.56s]  I know. Trust me. I'm aware. I know. Imagine paying 75,000 points. Okay. About the hospital's
[3935.56s -> 3940.44s]  equipment. I've been wanting to upgrade the hospital's equipment with the latest models
[3941.00s -> 3947.94s]  for some time, but to do that we need $15,000. I can do it. You don't have enough money? What?
[3948.66s -> 3962.10s]  I don't have any money. I don't have enough money. All right. I'm going to go get,
[3962.10s -> 3973.21s]  I gotta get money. Imagine using points and not advertising Nancy Drew. All right. I'm going to
[3973.21s -> 3979.80s]  go grind. Uh, where's a good grind spot? Those, uh, it's a good spot to get like quick money.
[3980.52s -> 3995.78s]  That old, that old town place. Go to the card and forest dungeon. Um, on a pulse that I didn't make,
[3995.78s -> 4000.02s]  I don't mean anything. I just want to make sure to wear that. Replace German with Bugleberry for
[4000.02s -> 4014.70s]  rest of the stream. No. Why would I do that? In like title, the stream Bugleberry finishes
[4014.70s -> 4036.34s]  Mega Man. What are you guys trying to do to me? All right. The dungeon here. Vacuum for grinding.
[4049.94s -> 4061.85s]  Save the grocer's wife. Why is this a good grind spot?
[4061.85s -> 4069.42s]  Do you place it in that old city better? This is not the dungeon.
[4071.58s -> 4081.59s]  This is not a good spot. Yeah. The dead, the spots with the, um, yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[4092.22s -> 4099.66s]  Bring the drill into. Yeah. I'm going to, I'll equip the drill. Uh, let's go. Which one's this one
[4099.66s -> 4106.66s]  downtown? Let's go to the one. Let's go. I'm here. I'm ready. I just need like fucking to do it like
[4106.66s -> 4126.26s]  two or three times. How much do I donate for a full 60 seconds of Bugleberry? I really don't know
[4126.26s -> 4136.74s]  where I'm supposed to be going next. I think if it were me and it is me Bugleberry, I would say
[4136.74s -> 4151.35s]  I would need to go west. Oh, sure. It's scary for diabolical going west. I will tell you something
[4151.35s -> 4159.51s]  that I think is important. I have not picked up a controller in probably 30 years. I don't know
[4159.51s -> 4163.75s]  anything about video games. I don't know what buttons to press. Maybe you guys could help me,
[4163.75s -> 4171.72s]  but I thought it would be fantastic. Oh, that was, oh, I forgot to tell you the price. Uh,
[4171.72s -> 4181.51s]  it was five grand. A thousand, a hundred thousand channel points to get a high from Bugleberry. No,
[4181.51s -> 4186.55s]  that's the same thing as a wink. It's just more, it's a button I have to press and I have to derail
[4186.55s -> 4199.53s]  like, oh, hey, it's me Bugleberry. Hey, it's me Bugleberry. Hey, oh, oh, oh, it's me Bugleberry.
[4207.58s -> 4226.52s]  A million points. Oh, fuck. Exposed. It's not him. Go get the mask. No. No, I don't want to get the
[4226.52s -> 4231.32s]  mask and turn the lights down in the room and like do Bugleberry. No, he's not here.
[4237.05s -> 4240.01s]  What am I doing? I keep getting sidetracked. All right, I'm going to go up.
[4240.97s -> 4256.90s]  No, I, it's right here. There it is. Save the Grosher's wife.
[4258.15s -> 4260.39s]  They'll be all right for a little bit. I'll be good. I just need to get some money.
[4269.19s -> 4286.92s]  I'm gonna let Bugleberry scream. I'm gonna get killed. How much are these all worth? What's the,
[4286.92s -> 4310.81s]  what are the blue ones actually even worth? Oh, what the heck? Where? I haven't saved the fucking
[4310.81s -> 4313.53s]  game. I haven't saved the fucking game. I haven't saved the fucking game. I haven't saved the fucking
[4313.53s -> 4346.28s]  game. I gotta kill this guy first. Explode. There we go. All right, good. 75,000 for
[4346.28s -> 4358.12s]  Germakiss. I don't even know what that means. My cat's having a bad dream. Can you wish her well?
[4359.00s -> 4370.06s]  No, I wish you, I wish you not having a bad dream, cat. Did it help?
[4377.37s -> 4392.12s]  Pretty good grind spot. You're right. All right, do it again. How much money do I have? 33,000.
[4392.44s -> 4410.98s]  I'm gonna do this like five times. 19,000. I'll make it faster with the vacuum. Come pick me up.
[4411.62s -> 4417.94s]  Are you sure? This is like an eight dollar lift ride. You really want to go down the street?
[4417.94s -> 4440.94s]  Yeah, I guess. I don't want to walk. Where's my, not the drill, not the grenade. The vacuum. Okay.
[4441.74s -> 4466.34s]  Coke versus Pepsi. Coke is better. Coke is better than Pepsi. In fact, most of the Coke products
[4466.34s -> 4488.58s]  are better than the Pepsi products. For instance, like Sprite, way better. Sprite,
[4488.58s -> 4492.90s]  yes. Sprite's the best soda. Like just, if I could only have one soda for the rest of my life,
[4492.90s -> 4507.22s]  it would be Sprite. Okay, everyone asks for Coke and Sprite, but all you have is Sierra
[4507.22s -> 4513.50s]  Mist and Pepsi. I know. It's like, you know, frankly, it's bullshit. I'll be honest. Frankly,
[4513.50s -> 4518.94s]  it's bullshit. Can I get a Coke? We have Pepsi only. Yeah, they made a Super Bowl commercial on
[4518.94s -> 4531.40s]  it. Doesn't that mean that people like Coke more than Pepsi? Remember like the Steve Carell
[4531.40s -> 4537.16s]  commercial where it was like, is Pepsi okay? Is Pepsi okay? No, Pepsi's better and it's awesome
[4537.16s -> 4554.04s]  and of course it's okay. Well, I asked for Coke, but clearly it's not. They're both the same damn
[4554.04s -> 4560.28s]  thing. The only difference is Coke. Pepsi is like smoother than Coke. Coke is a little harsher.
[4560.28s -> 4598.41s]  I like it like that though. Joel bullies Germo. What? I don't have time for his shit right now.
[4599.37s -> 4616.42s]  Free money. Free money. Free money. Free money. Free money. Free money. Free money. Yep.
[4617.14s -> 4635.14s]  Coke in the glass is unbeatable. Yeah, I would say so. Where are you? How much for a Bugleberry
[4635.14s -> 4639.14s]  appearance? What if I just did like a one-man show and there was those, you remember those old like
[4639.14s -> 4644.98s]  infomercial kind of commercials? Imagine I advertised for it on TV. Like Bugleberry being
[4644.98s -> 4649.94s]  there would be like a selling point for one of the tickets. And don't forget, B.F. Bugleberry
[4649.94s -> 4656.15s]  will make his appearance doing his one-man take on the current horror movies. And it's just fucking
[4656.15s -> 4669.18s]  me in a mask like, for one night only. And who could forget Grandpa? And just me with a mustache
[4669.18s -> 4681.10s]  on like a hat on like, you know, you're ruining the illusion. But that would be me doing the
[4681.10s -> 4700.23s]  Bugleberry impression. I can't. I mean, these are real people. You don't think I have a real
[4700.23s -> 4729.51s]  grandfather? I, of course I do. And he's been on camera. All right, give me a room. This way,
[4729.51s -> 4736.02s]  that way, this way, that way, this way, that way. Ever since somebody said that with the auto face
[4736.02s -> 4758.10s]  is the only thing I can think of. Whoa, you came out of nowhere. You storm trooper for the next
[4758.10s -> 4765.38s]  five minutes. What does that mean? What are you talking about? Like,
[4769.94s -> 4805.06s]  that what you want? Pick up that cam. That it? Nope. That's that was on like Obama on a shitty
[4805.06s -> 4827.91s]  mic. Okay, the pitch is down. I get you. It's a combine. All right. Yeah, I see. What does it
[4827.91s -> 4868.76s]  sound like? You just called Obama on the phone. I didn't get the money. Do pick up that.
[4868.76s -> 4944.30s]  Yeah. I'm missing money. What? I have to pay attention to video games. Call Bernie Sanders.
[4945.02s -> 4951.02s]  This is not like the impression. The funny impression hour. Who cares? Yeah. Well, I
[4951.98s -> 4960.42s]  call Bernie. Oh, I've been called Bernie Sanders right now. Let's see what he's up to.
[4969.50s -> 4976.90s]  Actually, I know what he's up to. He's debating on stage down the street. That's where he is.
[4977.46s -> 4999.51s]  They're in Nevada right now. How much money do I have? All right. I got enough. I got enough.
[5000.07s -> 5009.40s]  We can go do all this stuff. Raid them with this. Wait, raid the Democratic primary debate.
[5010.28s -> 5018.47s]  It's not even that's not impossible. Can you imagine how stupid that would be?
[5019.19s -> 5028.92s]  All right. Imagine a world, right? Can you imagine? Yeah. And Elizabeth Warren, what do you
[5028.92s -> 5035.38s]  think about? Oh, hold on a second here. What's going on? Are we getting a raid? Yeah. It looks
[5035.38s -> 5042.10s]  like we're getting a raid from German 985. Gerber, Gerber. Hey, how are you, Gerber? It is great to
[5042.18s -> 5049.38s]  hear your voice. Oh, the rats. Here come the rats. Here they are. Oh, the rats. Here they are.
[5049.38s -> 5054.26s]  I love those rats. Hey, how stupid would that be? It would be fucking unbelievable.
[5054.26s -> 5062.97s]  People just keep raiding to get like this. Hey, thanks for the raid. It would be like calling
[5062.97s -> 5071.67s]  out people in chat. I just want to say, if we could put it in sub only mode, I'm seeing a lot
[5071.67s -> 5085.10s]  of bullshit over here. I don't, there's a lot of stuff that I don't like. No, no, no. You don't
[5085.26s -> 5087.34s]  actually have. No, I don't mean, that wasn't me.
[5098.87s -> 5102.79s]  Raiding the debate and they have to address it. And if they don't address it, it's like, yo,
[5102.79s -> 5109.61s]  whoa. I'm not going to like, not going to mention the raid. Okay. But if I follow any of you on
[5109.61s -> 5123.59s]  Twitter. All right. Let's go back to, uh, they do like an elaborate, like, like, oh, we got a raid
[5123.59s -> 5127.67s]  and they fucking start screaming and like talking about the raid. Like, look out, it's a raid.
[5128.63s -> 5134.47s]  Oh, the German, the rats. Everyone has their own, everyone gets like 10 seconds to respond.
[5141.21s -> 5149.74s]  Um, Mr. Steyer, how do you respond to the rat raid? I don't, I, I don't know who the fuck that
[5149.74s -> 5172.22s]  is. Can we go back to the issues, please? Steyer's not in the debate. Really? Are you sure? Because
[5172.22s -> 5191.19s]  he's the only commercial I see on TV. Are we certain about that? All right. Where am I going?
[5197.82s -> 5200.78s]  All right. Right. I get it. Okay. I got to go. Who watches TV?
[5203.83s -> 5208.07s]  Hospital. All right. We're going to go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up the city hall.
[5208.07s -> 5218.63s]  Just take me there. If you have enough, if you have enough Twitch followers, you get to be on
[5218.63s -> 5231.24s]  the debate stage. Yeah. The new, the new, uh, the new percentages you need to be on the stage at
[5231.24s -> 5237.40s]  the Nevada debate. Yeah. You need at least 10% of the national poll or a peak at over 10,000
[5237.40s -> 5244.63s]  concurrent viewers on Twitch. We've got quite a few people here actually from like the Twitch
[5244.63s -> 5276.39s]  side of things. Ninja versus Bernie debate. All right. Let's, let's get the fuck out of this.
[5288.71s -> 5307.53s]  Oh, we're talking politics. No, I'm not. We're talking, uh, I guess kind of. Tom Steyer paid
[5307.53s -> 5331.59s]  for a mariachi band and a taco truck at my caucus location in South Vegas. Hey for the equipment.
[5337.29s -> 5353.29s]  Yeah. The debates are in Vegas right now. I can pay for that. Did I do it? About the investigation.
[5354.38s -> 5359.26s]  The only room left unexplored is the main gate. Who knows what's inside and what will happen if
[5359.26s -> 5364.46s]  we tamper with it. I don't know if it hadn't been for you, Mega Man. I shudder to think what those
[5364.46s -> 5372.20s]  pirates would have done to the Island. I'll leave everything in your capable hands. All right. Let's
[5372.20s -> 5376.28s]  go back. The fate of our Island rests on your shoulders. Thanks for the pressure. God damn it.
[5376.28s -> 5389.29s]  You could have just said good luck. All right. Somebody just said fail politics with a cringe
[5389.29s -> 5404.28s]  country. What does that mean? Fail politics for a cringed country. That's fucking ridiculous.
[5411.67s -> 5418.81s]  I love it. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Dude, your country is kind of cringe.
[5420.79s -> 5429.45s]  I mean, this isn't, this isn't your dad singing happy birthday in loudly in a restaurant for
[5429.45s -> 5450.07s]  dinner. This is like an entire country. What? That's not inaccurate. Exactly. Oh, shit. Oh,
[5450.07s -> 5465.32s]  shit. Debate panel. Bernie, how would you like to respond to that? I just want to say that I think
[5465.96s -> 5478.33s]  that answer was cringe. Yeah. Oh, cringe, you fucker. You posted cringe and you shouldn't feel bad for
[5479.29s -> 5512.10s]  that. Get him, get him Bernie. You face cam for the entire stream. No, he's not talking about his
[5512.10s -> 5533.00s]  other people's low sub and follower count. I mean, I don't. All right. I got to play,
[5533.00s -> 5549.27s]  I have to play Mega Man Legends. Okay. Hold on. Did I save it? I did. Right. We got to go to the
[5549.27s -> 5568.97s]  hospital, which is in uptown. Do Obama reading bits from the phone? Bro, are we playing Mega
[5568.97s -> 5587.77s]  Man Legends or not? Fuck. Yes. Yes, we are. Yes, we are. Back to the hospital. This way, that way,
[5587.77s -> 5603.94s]  this way, that way. Oh, I can't get it out of my head. I love it. Okay. I'm here. You have to,
[5603.94s -> 5608.55s]  you can't go inside without checking in. I mean, can't you guys just put me on like a list? I'm
[5608.55s -> 5631.91s]  the guy in the blue suit. Oh, shit. The nurse told me that you bought them a machine that fixed my leg.
[5632.79s -> 5640.60s]  Thank you. This is for you. What is it? I found it when I was out for a walk.
[5640.60s -> 5660.41s]  Flower Pearl. Come back and see me again. Pearl. Come back and see me again. All right. A little
[5660.41s -> 5665.21s]  more rehabilitation and her leg will be as good as new. She can go home then. Thank you so much.
[5666.01s -> 5687.99s]  That's what I do. I'm Mega Man. Finally saved the grocer's wife. She's out in a field. I don't know
[5687.99s -> 5695.61s]  where that is. I have no idea. I have no idea. I don't know where that is. Let's see if I can do
[5695.61s -> 5715.46s]  anything with this. I wonder if I got the posse to do anything with this. Develop something. Let me.
[5718.60s -> 5724.20s]  Mega Man. Gatling part and Flower Pearl were used to make the Buster part Gatling gun.
[5725.24s -> 5751.34s]  Really? So, Kardon Forest. Can you tell me there's somebody right here? The one percent of
[5751.34s -> 5756.38s]  streamers, they got all the bits. That's cringe everyone. We need to wake up, wake up America.
[5756.38s -> 5769.13s]  We need to give big bits to the people. That's a cringe. God damn it. So, walk through the path
[5769.13s -> 5798.12s]  between the rocks at the flutter. The path between the rocks. These two rocks. Got it. I came out
[5798.12s -> 5805.03s]  here to get some fresh air and look at the scenery, but my stomach, oh it hurts. What do you do? Take
[5805.03s -> 5822.34s]  her to the hospital. See if she gets better. Anna, are you all right? Sorry, but you can't go inside
[5822.34s -> 5830.28s]  without. You just watched me come in and bring like a sick person. Have you come to visit Iron?
[5830.28s -> 5841.45s]  No. If you're worried about that woman who just came in, she's fine. Maybe you should come back
[5841.45s -> 5860.38s]  after she's calmed down a little. Outman. Use a JPG instead of a face cam? Nah. I'm back. My new
[5860.38s -> 5869.75s]  father seems really happy. Thanks for your help. You're welcome. Um, I did? Have you come to visit
[5869.75s -> 5878.94s]  Iron? I, no, I came to, is that it? That's it. You're the one who helped Anna, aren't you? Thank you
[5878.94s -> 5894.15s]  so much. Here, take this as a token of my thanks. You got a sunlight. All right. But did you just
[5894.15s -> 5927.83s]  like push me outside? Get some vitamin D, you little shit. Can I do anything with this? Nope. Okay.
[5929.24s -> 5937.77s]  All right. It's time. It's time to go to the main gate. It's time. I'm gonna put on the Gatling gun.
[5937.77s -> 5954.31s]  Put it here. Okay. Buster parts. Equip. The Gatling gun. So this is attack four. Gatling gun is
[5956.02s -> 5977.35s]  one, attack one range in four energy. No. I think what I had on was the best thing I can do.
[5977.99s -> 5997.66s]  It's just a ton of attack in a ton of, I can just spam with the max attack. The only thing I do,
[5997.66s -> 6005.05s]  I mean, I only have rapid. I'm surprised this is not rapid. Okay. How could it be Gatling gun?
[6005.05s -> 6019.21s]  If it's just, yeah, I'll keep what I had on. I have to put, I'm going to spend the rest of my money.
[6023.22s -> 6036.46s]  We have to go downtown first. We got to refill the canteen. Buy a couple more things and that's it.
[6036.46s -> 6059.18s]  Try it. Please try it. Try it. Try it. What? Is that north? I went to the museum. I'm still missing
[6059.18s -> 6066.14s]  a couple items though. Hope you have a wonderful day. See you later. Hope you have a wonderful day
[6066.14s -> 6086.12s]  too. Thanks. That's really nice of you. Say that. Refill canteen. All right. Buy. This Kevlar jacket
[6086.12s -> 6108.42s]  is 120. But fuck it. Blasted unit. Range. Turbo battery. Is there any rapid? No. Blasted unit omega.
[6109.06s -> 6126.84s]  Is that two and three? That's kind of okay. But is it maxed out? I'll get the, I'll get the
[6126.84s -> 6131.08s]  shield. The invincibility. I'm going to get the invulnerability shield and just get all these
[6131.08s -> 6137.74s]  things. I'll figure out what the fuck they do. All right. I'm going to sell some stuff. Sell.
[6141.21s -> 6163.35s]  Oh my God. No, I'm using all these. I don't think I'm going to use these ever. I really don't think
[6163.35s -> 6172.42s]  I'm going to put at least these. Maybe the Gatling gun. Maybe. I don't know. I have no idea. What about
[6172.42s -> 6180.23s]  items? Anything worth a lot of money? Can I get a hit of your jewel please?
[6200.63s -> 6211.64s]  All right. Time to save the game. Not yet. We do special weapons. Change weapon. I'm going to,
[6211.64s -> 6214.92s]  what should I put on for? Active buster. I think that's what I've upgraded the most.
[6215.80s -> 6219.96s]  Active buster. And we're going to enhance it. Do I have enough money to do anything with it?
[6219.96s -> 6233.46s]  I have 14,000. Nope. Blow. Blow. Please. Please. Blow. What? Please. Bro. Bro. Please. Please,
[6233.46s -> 6240.94s]  bro. Do a five second review of Overwatch. Um, the game was fun for six months and I never
[6240.94s -> 6277.98s]  played it again. That's it. Save again. Rick and Morty impressions. That's not going to happen.
[6277.98s -> 6284.87s]  Anybody know if the new episode came out yet? The new, like they were there, they're half season,
[6284.87s -> 6319.35s]  right? Oh, try Gatling gun. Try Gatling gun. Try Gatling gun. So let's go. Let's take off.
[6320.31s -> 6334.58s]  Auto battery and put on Gatling gun. You can see it's not doing very much. It was better having
[6335.72s -> 6351.27s]  the auto battery on, but I have max energy that I can just spam. I'm going to hold it down the
[6351.27s -> 6357.91s]  whole time. Move around. All right. Let's go to the room. Uh, I have to go to, it's all the way down.
[6358.71s -> 6373.24s]  Wish I had the Kevlar right now, but I don't. Oh, I'm so fucking nervous. Screen saver room
[6377.22s -> 6384.58s]  or, I mean, we've given this a couple of names. This also could be potential virus. Why? Why can
[6384.58s -> 6395.10s]  I say ours today? Potential virus. The joke is ruined. Potential virus shareware FPS game made
[6395.10s -> 6406.81s]  by one person in like 1996. If I said it correctly the first time, maybe it would have been humorous.
[6416.44s -> 6434.01s]  Shareware? What? What did I, I said shareware. Shareware. Shareware. And now I have, now my
[6434.01s -> 6452.89s]  shield's gone. What? He's devolving. Shareware. I have an accent sometimes. You know, everybody
[6452.89s -> 6462.23s]  doesn't talk the same way. There's different places that have different accents. Nobody talks
[6462.23s -> 6495.10s]  the same way. Build it. Build it. How do I activate that super shield? It's a good level
[6495.10s -> 6508.71s]  design. I know it's not. I'm sorry. I'm showing you this, that level design. Why is it so bright?
[6508.71s -> 6515.21s]  It's part of the way the game gets captured through this upscaler. All right. Here we go.
[6515.21s -> 6524.68s]  This is it, right? Huh? There's some writing. Watcher. What is that supposed to mean?
[6525.24s -> 6538.42s]  It's just labeled, Mega Man. The second door. What is this? It reads sleeper.
[6544.82s -> 6552.90s]  Third door. What does this one say? Dreamer? Well, it should be the last one.
[6562.01s -> 6569.96s]  Uh oh. Here comes the great, the big reveal of the game. What's happening to me? This is the first
[6569.96s -> 6576.52s]  time I've ever been here, but I feel like I've seen this before. Something is telling me there's
[6576.52s -> 6608.18s]  danger here, that it shouldn't be opened. Uh oh. It's a man? Person? Sephiroth? Was it you who
[6608.18s -> 6620.38s]  awoke me? It is somewhat earlier than I had, but no matter. Thank you for awakening me. Hmm. Have
[6620.38s -> 6627.48s]  we met before? Oh, please forgive me. You are a purifier model, assigned to the direct command
[6627.56s -> 6634.12s]  of Mother. Team Rocket? You are designated Mega Man Trigger. Please forgive me. I did not recognize
[6634.12s -> 6645.51s]  you in your current configuration. You, you know me? You don't remember? Ah, I see. You have
[6645.51s -> 6654.98s]  suffered memory loss, yes? Then for what purpose have you awakened me? I assume. I'm gonna kill you
[6654.98s -> 6660.74s]  myself, that's why. That your reason for coming here is to purge the carbons that have over
[6660.74s -> 6668.36s]  propagated during the time I was inactive. Carbons? Purge? What are you talking about?
[6669.24s -> 6674.60s]  According to Urban Military Security Ordinance A10, the number of carbon units is not allowed
[6674.60s -> 6680.28s]  to increase beyond the pre-specified limit. If this happens, they are to be purged immediately.
[6680.28s -> 6685.88s]  My observation, if left unattended, the carbons will reproduce indefinitely. Their numbers will
[6685.88s -> 6691.72s]  grow, polluting the surface world. They can be quite a nuisance. Carbons? Do you mean
[6692.44s -> 6698.44s]  the people on the island? The carbons fit mass population Model B. They are unstable,
[6699.16s -> 6705.48s]  very difficult to control. Perhaps it would be better to simply reinitialize. Reinitialize?
[6705.48s -> 6708.12s]  No, no, you don't understand. I haven't understood much of what you've been saying,
[6708.12s -> 6714.74s]  but when you say reinitialize, do you mean no? No, you don't. No, no, the universe is fine.
[6714.98s -> 6716.02s]  The universe is fine.
[6717.78s -> 6723.18s]  Teasel? This is quite reprehensible. It would be much simpler if I had the
[6723.18s -> 6728.30s]  assistance of a proficient unit such as yourself. It was horrible. Once my task is complete,
[6728.30s -> 6731.66s]  I shall inquire as to the presence of a backup of your memory on A1.
[6731.66s -> 6735.82s]  All right, can we get the stop? No more flashing, please? Yes, until then.
[6737.98s -> 6752.63s]  Oh, this hurts. I'm about to press a button. Did you hear that, Teasel? Yep,
[6752.63s -> 6761.62s]  something tells me he's not kidding either. It's the Tron bones. Teasel, we've got to do
[6761.62s -> 6768.94s]  something. We've got to stop him. That's easier said than done. Besides, do you think we could
[6768.94s -> 6779.53s]  beat him? The Tron bones. What about Mega Man? I don't like it, but I can't think of anything
[6779.53s -> 6790.55s]  better, so. Oh, here's a problem. Hey, Tron, how do you stop this thing?
[6791.67s -> 6804.81s]  Oh, this? Like this. Thank you. Mega Man. Oh shit, pirates. Thanks for your help.
[6804.81s -> 6818.38s]  Hurry up. He's getting away. Right. It's not over between you and me. I won't forgive you if you die
[6818.38s -> 6831.66s]  or anything stupid like that, so be careful in there, okay? Right. See you later. Don't worry,
[6831.66s -> 6839.32s]  Tron. If anyone can do it, he can. I know. Don't die, you stupid fucking idiot. I haven't even
[6839.32s -> 6867.66s]  got a chance to play. I'm going to get healed. Just relax. Ooh, Mega Man dies from the first
[6867.66s -> 6875.29s]  enemy. Power stream. He's still giving me items. Isn't this like the final portion of the whole
[6875.29s -> 6894.92s]  game? Oh shit, a golden crab. Is it a buster part? Oh fuck, it is. All right, laser is plus four
[6894.92s -> 6904.18s]  attack. Max is out attack. All right, hold on a second here. Maxed attack, maxed energy. That
[6904.18s -> 6915.82s]  means I don't need this anymore. Energy in rapid? No, no, I don't need any. I'm looking for range
[6915.82s -> 6926.04s]  in rapid. Do I have any range in rapid? No range, no rapid. Energy in range, attack in range,
[6928.86s -> 6938.28s]  attack, range, and energy. No, I don't need that. I have rapid two. Is rapid two better than range
[6938.28s -> 6961.61s]  in rapid one? Let's see. I lose range though. That's okay, that's pretty good. Gatling gun, laser.
[6961.61s -> 6977.14s]  No, there's nothing else down here. Damn, no range. Are we sure? Range, sniper scope. I mean,
[6977.14s -> 6986.47s]  that's just a, just, it's all range. Let me see what this does. Range and a little bit more range
[6986.47s -> 7002.26s]  and then I'll do this for now. No, you're right. I'm going to need the range. I'm going to need the
[7002.26s -> 7023.56s]  range. Might as well take it if it's for free. Final boss room is tiny. Well, appreciate the
[7023.56s -> 7035.56s]  spoiler because that means I can take this off. And what is this going to do rapid too? Or is it,
[7035.56s -> 7053.54s]  it was a rapid, what's it called? Rapid striker. But this range might be bad. Oh well. I have plus
[7053.54s -> 7066.07s]  three rapid? Did I? Is this the room? You can feel tremendous energy emanating from the refractor.
[7066.07s -> 7075.06s]  It's being held in place by some kind of powerful force. It appears as if the entire main gate
[7075.06s -> 7097.29s]  is under the control of Mega Man Juno. Who am I? Mega Man Volnut, right? Well, looks like we're
[7097.29s -> 7111.29s]  going this way. Mega Man Juno versus Mega Man Volnut. His name is much cooler than mine. This
[7111.29s -> 7141.22s]  is a bright area. I can't even see. Dentist hallway? Yeah, pretty much. Uh oh. What's the
[7141.22s -> 7148.39s]  point of this room? No, what's the point of this room? Like, why would you put that there? I'm
[7148.39s -> 7172.07s]  fucking pissed. Well, I haven't gone this way.
[7181.38s -> 7188.07s]  Well, I found the door. Well, we've come a long way, haven't we? It would have been nice if we
[7188.07s -> 7193.06s]  could have just kept on living in peace with Professor Enroll. But I guess we got to do what
[7193.06s -> 7228.89s]  we got to do, right? Mega Man Juno is waiting for you inside. A fucking cringed monkey. I'm not
[7228.89s -> 7247.32s]  done exploring. Tell me the lore? What lore do you want me to tell you? I'm not done exploring.
[7250.20s -> 7254.36s]  No, I'm not. I'm not done. Look at down there. There's probably a secret enemy.
[7255.16s -> 7284.70s]  There's not. No holes or anything? Well, what the fuck? All right, let's go. It's the end game. I
[7284.70s -> 7292.20s]  know, but I would think there'd be some fun. Didn't 100% the game? It's too bad, I know.
[7299.29s -> 7304.09s]  Tell me, what should I do now? Mega Man Juno is waiting for you inside. You can do it,
[7304.09s -> 7311.16s]  Mega Man. I believe in you. Is it going to be okay? Well, you may not know anything about Juno, but
[7311.16s -> 7317.06s]  judging from his model type, I'd say that your combat capabilities exceed his. Juno wasn't
[7317.06s -> 7321.86s]  designed for combat, but still, as master of the island, you shouldn't underestimate him.
[7321.86s -> 7328.18s]  Your relative levels of strength depend on how much you've developed your capabilities and weapons.
[7328.18s -> 7333.91s]  What am I? What's the matter, Mega Man? Oh, you're wondering about what Juno said, hey?
[7333.91s -> 7338.82s]  Does it matter? Whoever you are, you're still Mega Man, right? Come on,
[7338.82s -> 7343.48s]  Roll and everyone else are counting on you. This is the real villain. You can't give up now.
[7343.48s -> 7356.36s]  This is the real villain. I knew it was going to- I should have said it. I was thinking it,
[7356.36s -> 7359.32s]  but I didn't say it. I knew it was going to be a fucking organ, and I didn't say it,
[7359.32s -> 7364.36s]  and it would have been perfect. It appears I miscalculated the odds of your ability
[7364.36s -> 7368.68s]  to escape that trap. Shit. I was going to say it too, right when I opened the door.
[7368.68s -> 7378.07s]  However, too late. Eden was activated as soon as I entered this room. It cannot be deactivated as
[7378.07s -> 7386.26s]  long as I, the master key of this island, remain here in this controller. A lot of trash out in
[7386.26s -> 7392.26s]  space. All that remains now is to wait for Eden to enter transmission range and send the command
[7392.26s -> 7402.76s]  to execute the reinitialization of this island. Once that command is received, the 10,000 workers
[7402.76s -> 7408.34s]  aboard Eden will execute it immediately. My estimates indicate their work will be completed
[7408.34s -> 7413.67s]  in less than five minutes. I only said Trump voice. This doesn't sound like Trump at all.
[7414.31s -> 7455.51s]  Not even close. Uh, we stopped this, right? Now that Eden has been activated, any further
[7455.51s -> 7459.91s]  interference from you will remain on file, thus tarnishing my operating record. Now that Eden
[7459.91s -> 7464.15s]  has been activated- No, no, it's not. Fortunately, you are suffering from memory loss and fragmentation.
[7465.27s -> 7471.35s]  Therefore, as keeper of this island, I hereby exercise my prerogative of correctional dispensation.
[7471.99s -> 7480.20s]  Correctional? Allow me to rephrase. I will exercise my authority to terminate your program.
[7482.87s -> 7483.35s]  Begin!
[7501.99s -> 7521.35s]  Oh! Oh! Oh! Not a combat model yet. What the fuck are you talking about?
[7525.08s -> 7531.42s]  Don't I have like invincibility? How do I turn on invincibility mode?
[7532.06s -> 7556.60s]  How about this? Ready? How about this?
[7556.60s -> 7568.44s]  Oi! What the fuck is he? What the fuck?
[7575.70s -> 7583.13s]  Fucking L1R1 to turn the camera. It's just like, I may as well fucking put a blindfold on.
[7583.69s -> 7607.64s]  I'm killing him, don't worry. Yeah, I chose that setting because the other one was way worse.
[7607.64s -> 7613.56s]  The other one does- you can't strafe. Strafing doesn't exist if I turn the other one on,
[7613.56s -> 7661.00s]  which sucks. Oh, what a pain in the absolute ass this actually is.
[7667.05s -> 7679.93s]  It's just puke controlled. The whole world got- the quick turn like is hard to do because it's down
[7679.93s -> 7691.21s]  in circle and sometimes it doesn't do anything. By the time you turn around you have to- he's
[7691.21s -> 7702.17s]  already gone, so I have to hold R1 to like- and then walk forward. I can't increase the
[7702.17s -> 7704.73s]  sensitivity on that fucking R-E. It's not gonna happen.
[7704.73s -> 7738.63s]  What the fuck is happening?
[7801.90s -> 7810.15s]  Somebody said that in chat. I thought you were making fun of me, but it's what a line he says.
[7833.35s -> 7835.24s]  Ready?
[7838.60s -> 7842.89s]  Not good enough. Turn, turn around. Turn the fuck around.
[7844.89s -> 7861.67s]  What does that move? Heal. He's got a new attack this motherfucker.
[7861.67s -> 7861.99s]  Ready?
[7878.81s -> 7880.09s]  Oh, I forgot!
[7880.25s -> 7880.49s]  What?
[7888.42s -> 7890.90s]  What? I jumped over it.
[7932.25s -> 7947.35s]  The fuck is?
[7950.15s -> 7975.64s]  Hey, I'm ready for you to die. No choke. No choke. No choke. No choke. I can't even turn
[7975.64s -> 7977.48s]  the fucking camera. I can't even turn the camera. I can't even turn the camera.
[7997.83s -> 7998.47s]  Oh shit.
[8006.66s -> 8008.74s]  Really? It's- it's delayed.
[8014.86s -> 8016.22s]  He's gonna plug into a big thing.
[8018.22s -> 8023.30s]  He's plugging into the ceiling and he's gonna turn into a giant thing. He's gonna turn to a
[8023.30s -> 8026.74s]  key and unlock the door and behind the door is gonna be something huge.
[8028.10s -> 8030.34s]  Yeah, of course there is. Why wouldn't there be?
[8118.57s -> 8129.27s]  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Turn! What?
[8129.27s -> 8168.55s]  What is that move he's doing? What the fuck is this move? Shield repair.
[8170.10s -> 8183.70s]  Okay, now go invisible and recharge special weapon. All right, let's go.
[8183.70s -> 8214.49s]  He can't see shit. He doesn't know where I am. And then- oh my god.
[8217.46s -> 8229.35s]  I thought I had the shield fixed. I thought I've repaired the shield and I could take another hit.
[8229.35s -> 8244.36s]  I killed you even with that. All right. It's because I got hit twice?
[8244.36s -> 8261.58s]  I don't even have that Kevlar, you're right. Fuck. It's not good. All right, let me try it again.
[8305.19s -> 8319.61s]  Turn please. I'll get greedy.
[8326.42s -> 8335.64s]  Oh! This camera makes me want to throw up in my mouth. Turn the fucking camera game.
[8335.64s -> 8339.72s]  Oh, he's getting actually bad. Actually bad. Actually bad.
[8375.30s -> 8385.00s]  This moves around so quickly and I can't turn fast enough. Like, fuck you.
[8386.28s -> 8396.66s]  I might have to go get the vest. I do have a full heal but I don't want to use it yet.
[8423.29s -> 8438.33s]  Oh shit. Where is he? Piece of shit. Like, fuck that.
[8442.58s -> 8446.90s]  Get these fucking things off, by the way. Get the sca- no. Where's the jump? Get these off.
[8447.70s -> 8454.09s]  Get these- get them out of here. I like just moon shoes up into the air.
[8481.83s -> 8487.62s]  Don't skip. Uh oh! Put them back on. Put them back on. Put them back on. Put them back on. Put them
[8487.62s -> 8495.54s]  back on. Put these back on. They're very useful. Incredibly useful. Because now I- uh oh. Oh!
[8495.54s -> 8519.78s]  Are you ready? No, I'm not.
[8553.94s -> 8571.30s]  Don't jump at me. Alright, don't- jump now and then jump again. Here comes the lightning. Oh!
[8573.14s -> 8594.41s]  I'm getting geno flashed. Damn it, I'm trying to fucking- the goddamn camera. Fuck this camera.
[8612.26s -> 8625.42s]  Oh my god! It's so- you don't understand. Moving around sucks in this game. He's doing it again.
[8626.14s -> 8650.86s]  Don't kill me, please! Step on his head.
[8663.75s -> 8669.51s]  So, fuck you. Pick this guy up and penalty soccer ball throw him into space.
[8670.39s -> 8673.83s]  Just watch him, like, crystallize while you go back to home.
[8689.59s -> 8694.63s]  Requesting a reinitialization of this island's systems and a memory backup of its bureaucratic
[8694.63s -> 8701.91s]  systems. That wasn't fast enough? Stop! Stop it! If you wish to shoot me, please do not hesitate.
[8703.27s -> 8713.08s]  My program has already been backed up in Eden's central core.
[8713.32s -> 8723.11s]  I eagerly await my next activation.
[8731.42s -> 8732.86s]  That was fucking ridiculous.
[8748.33s -> 8749.93s]  Oh, it's- trombone!
[8751.93s -> 8752.43s]  What?
[8759.53s -> 8760.33s]  Voice reveal?
[8779.03s -> 8787.19s]  What just happened?
[8825.51s -> 8835.18s]  Do you know why I stopped the car again?
[8859.10s -> 8870.52s]  Mega Man Legends 2.
[8898.76s -> 8919.70s]  What am I doing in EE?
[8923.96s -> 8932.04s]  That's the- that's the hold R1 to turn sound. I knew this game was sentient.
[8955.82s -> 8962.30s]  So soon after all you've done for us please stay a while longer we haven't had the chance to thank
[8962.30s -> 8969.42s]  you properly well it's not that we don't want to stay it's just that we've got some unfinished

[9968.34s -> 9973.94s]  next island if we sell what we found we'll get back what we lost and then some we'll live like
[9973.94s -> 9984.81s]  kings so they got the crystal who would have thought there was such a huge refractor down there
[9984.81s -> 9989.45s]  and all we had to do was just wander in and pick it up i told you we'd have the last laugh

[10024.76s -> 10037.80s]  ocean wouldn't it just like everywhere on earth how does that make any sense to be it actually

[10202.94s -> 10208.22s]  seven out of ten and when i got to the hospital of pain i was in i was getting so pissy with the
[10208.22s -> 10213.10s]  doctors in my family and i'm like yelling to get rid of the pain i did a casket it turns out i have
[10213.10s -> 10221.08s]  kidney stones in both kidneys holy shit that's not good i gotta pass them soon i wish you luck

[10240.78s -> 10244.70s]  half the sodas you drink a day with water and maybe squeeze a little bit of lemon in there
[10244.70s -> 10250.62s]  you won't you if you i need you need that sweetness you need that sugar you need that tang
[10251.34s -> 10255.34s]  squeeze a little bit of lemon just a little bit and it's in the water and you trick your brain
[10255.34s -> 10266.58s]  and think you're drinking fucking fruity yummy drink lime water yes if that's what you need to
[10266.58s -> 10275.00s]  drink more water that's what you need to do just a little squeeze of lime that's it no not lemonade
[10275.00s -> 10281.72s]  not lemonade no squeeze the lime or you could just drink water that's also true but if people
[10281.72s -> 10290.44s]  some people don't like to drink water if you're one of those people then gotta find ways to do it
[10291.08s -> 10299.11s]  what about sugar-free lemonade no because that has all kinds of other like chemical
[10299.11s -> 10312.82s]  bullshit in it you well you don't want either sugar-free water sugar sugar-free lemonade has
[10312.82s -> 10318.26s]  like if it has to it's got like fucking xylitol in it or like aspartame and you just hey just

[10402.31s -> 10410.49s]  problem for at least somewhere about maybe 18 to 20 months something like that just under two years

[10422.74s -> 10427.77s]  inflammation in my rib cage i've been doing physical therapy for it and if that doesn't
[10427.77s -> 10434.17s]  work and if that is what it actually is and it's determined that's the only thing i can do then i
[10434.17s -> 10440.01s]  have to get an intercostal nerve block it's an injection into one of my nerves kind of sucks
[10440.01s -> 10457.02s]  but you know that we do what we have to do and it's not i'm i'm fine don't worry it's just an
[10457.02s -> 10467.94s]  annoying issue but we'll see if pt does it are you paying two thousand dollars for 15 minute

[10504.15s -> 10514.63s]  just don't want to ignore them uh bulbous swag thanks for the 500 bits hey gamer do you think
[10514.63s -> 10519.19s]  it's more economically sound to save my channel points for the next big wink channel points thing
[10519.19s -> 10524.87s]  or use my points now also i had a theory that you only introduce winks so you'd have to wear clothes
[10526.04s -> 10539.32s]  well i mean i i didn't mean to do that that's that's sort of a an issue is me needing to wear
[10539.32s -> 10546.28s]  clothes and have to turn the facecam on every stream i mean that's the big problem who is that

[11028.78s -> 11038.01s]  like a monster cpu so i can do a higher um quality instead of streaming because i stream at 720 60
[11038.57s -> 11047.50s]  i'd like to go to like 960 900p 1080 i still don't like the idea of doing 1080 i don't think it looks
[11047.50s -> 11055.06s]  good at the bit rate that twitch allows you to use and with a he but a thread ripper or something
[11055.06s -> 11059.62s]  i could probably drop my preset to make it look really good and make it at somewhere on 900p
[11060.66s -> 11076.12s]  because with 1080 twitch only allows 6 000 up to if you go more than that they actually don't like
[11076.12s -> 11083.69s]  it at all so anything more than 6 000 up if you have you have a 1080p stream and you're not
[11084.33s -> 11090.58s]  at somewhere or at like eight to ten thousand up for a bit rate it's just i it's not i don't
[11090.58s -> 11105.74s]  think it's worth doing so i would be somewhere probably around 900 i don't know this computer
[11105.74s -> 11112.20s]  talk what's happening we're just talking about uh computers and how fast they are you get a lot
[11112.20s -> 11116.92s]  of encoding crossed on action games yeah you could do like 1080 30 but i don't want to do 1080 30
[11117.72s -> 11133.05s]  i'd rather stay at 60 but um thank you everybody for stopping appreciate it i think we're so far
[11133.05s -> 11140.01s]  beyond 30 fps at this point as the internet has grows and progresses here and how we consume all
[11140.01s -> 11148.94s]  this media 30 fps i don't think is it's like well you're at 30 fps i think most people almost
[11148.94s -> 11159.62s]  everybody streams at 60 nowadays and this stream has been streaming 60 fps for three four plus
[11159.62s -> 11165.62s]  years so it'd be really weird to be like oh by the way i'm at 1080 but uh my i'm at 30 fps now
[11166.26s -> 11180.65s]  but anyways let's uh let's move this and go to the end so we're at the end i will see you all
[11181.21s -> 11187.98s]  tomorrow 2 p.m but we have 250 from c4g i hit legend in hearthstone for the first time yesterday
[11187.98s -> 11193.83s]  and i'm dedicating this victory to you the chicken league champion will never stream hearthstone
[11193.83s -> 11201.75s]  again it was fun while it lasted though erdemious thanks for the 250 hey i don't care what chat says
[11201.75s -> 11205.67s]  bugleberry is the greatest character to ever grace the stream i love all of his appearances
[11205.67s -> 11209.99s]  on the stream do you have any pointers on where i could find a mask that looks like him i really
[11209.99s -> 11219.35s]  want to cosplay him i actually don't i don't i uh that that mask is not readily available
[11221.29s -> 11227.62s]  because you're talking about somebody's face uh there's not a mask of bugleberry's face
[11229.54s -> 11234.26s]  why would there be a mask of that it's not like a president or something
[11235.06s -> 11250.52s]  what what do you munk a essay he's a pop culture icon no he's not is he
[11252.60s -> 11261.64s]  this fucking guy laughing my ass off hey digitron surfers thanks for thousand bits 10 bucks
[11262.82s -> 11280.26s]  thank you this is i you don't have to read this out loud okay hold on all right i see what you're
[11280.26s -> 11289.06s]  saying here okay all right uh i'm gonna tell you you know i'm kind of out of that game at this point
[11289.06s -> 11296.36s]  i'm out of that game i'm out of that game at this point it's not the codes anymore
[11297.00s -> 11306.58s]  it's it's it's a voice work thing um i don't really do it anymore it's not something that i
[11306.58s -> 11318.58s]  really do no more voice acting he hates it it's just something i i i would love to put time into
[11318.58s -> 11334.79s]  it but i'd rather put time into this but no not voicing sonic he's retired he does voice acting
[11334.79s -> 11341.35s]  in every game without real voice acting yeah are you available hey i'm not available
[11343.08s -> 11348.18s]  at all you can only do four voices anyway
[11353.27s -> 11356.87s]  but i appreciate the offer i just i don't really they don't really do it
[11357.91s -> 11365.02s]  not anymore but auto is yelling at me can you hear auto fucking yelling at me he's like hey what
[11365.02s -> 11376.10s]  does he want from me can you hear him he just went hey hey he's hungry you know he's probably
[11376.10s -> 11386.47s]  hungry all right i will see you guys tomorrow thank you for watching this weird double feature
[11386.47s -> 11391.43s]  here mega man legends was awesome got frustrated at one or two parts but it's a 20 year old game so
[11392.23s -> 11395.67s]  how am i how's that not gonna happen i think it holds up pretty well i loved it
[11395.67s -> 11403.56s]  we'll play the second one soon talk to you guys tomorrow black and white too have a nice night
