[1.27s -> 6.07s]  Hey, what is happening guys? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[6.07s -> 11.83s]  Doing it with the Scout tonight, Default Scattergun, the Mad Milk, and the Unarmed Combat,
[11.83s -> 18.14s]  the new Halloween unlockable new Halloween item. If you are wondering why the cart is almost
[18.14s -> 23.50s]  kept for the enemy team, I'll tell you it's because we were getting absolutely dominated
[23.50s -> 28.22s]  in this gameplay. I was playing as a medic for the most part, and we were just getting crushed.
[28.30s -> 32.54s]  There was nothing we could have done. We were getting absolutely owned. This only took like
[32.54s -> 37.10s]  five minutes for them to get this far. I figured we were just gonna lose, so I switched over to
[37.10s -> 41.58s]  Scout just to get some kills, just to have a little bit of fun. And it turned out to be quite
[41.58s -> 46.94s]  a good thing because we end up coming back with a victory in this gameplay. And in other news,
[46.94s -> 53.08s]  did you guys see the trailer for Grand Theft Auto V? Oh my god, I can't wait for that game to come
[53.08s -> 57.80s]  out now. Unbearable it's gonna be in my brain when they announce, oh that's coming out in,
[58.12s -> 64.76s]  June 6th 2015. Oh my god, going back to San Andreas, going back to Los Santos, that's gonna
[64.76s -> 71.08s]  be so much fun. I can't wait to play it. I have played every Grand Theft Auto back to Grand Theft
[71.08s -> 77.96s]  Auto I. I was one of those guys that owned Grand Theft Auto London. If any of you guys know what
[77.96s -> 84.28s]  that is, if any of you know what Grand Theft Auto London is, then you get props from me because
[84.28s -> 90.92s]  that's an old, really not that well known game. So if you know what that is, mad props to you.
[90.92s -> 95.19s]  So this is kind of a derp moment right here. I jumped down here. Instead of going for the medic,
[95.19s -> 101.03s]  I shoot the heavy multiple times. I figured, I figured that our team had enough people shooting
[101.03s -> 106.38s]  at him or somebody was backing me up that I could get two meat shots on him and he would die. But
[106.38s -> 112.62s]  that was not the case and I end up looking like a derp derpington, which it's okay. Sometimes it's
[112.62s -> 120.34s]  okay to be a derp derpington. So I digress. Let's get back into this here. Barn Blitz is a crazy map.
[120.34s -> 125.38s]  Takes a long time to play Barn Blitz. I don't have a problem with maps that take a long time. It's
[125.38s -> 132.65s]  just the fact that upwards a very long map, bad waters a very long map. Most of the popular payload
[132.65s -> 139.05s]  maps happen to be the long, long maps, with the exception of course of Gold Rush. I wish they
[139.13s -> 144.41s]  would implement more maps like Gold Rush. You know, one, two control point checkpoints,
[144.41s -> 150.10s]  just because things go a little bit quicker. Because it can take potentially like 30 or 40
[150.10s -> 155.14s]  minutes to play one of these maps from beginning to end if the teams are balanced. Hopefully somebody
[155.14s -> 159.06s]  comes out with a map that's kind of like a Gold Rush but a little bit better, a little bit more
[159.06s -> 164.02s]  sleek and well-designed. I know there are plenty of custom maps that are like this, but I'm talking
[164.02s -> 170.01s]  more about official Valve style maps. So if you're looking for some scout tips on Barn Blitz,
[170.01s -> 174.01s]  here are a couple. These are the most important ones, especially when you get to this choke
[174.01s -> 178.33s]  point near the end of the last control point. This little area back here with the health pack
[178.33s -> 183.93s]  and the ammo pack is your best friend. I take out this pyro. I'm on fire. Keep going up here over
[183.93s -> 188.82s]  and over again. Probably go up here five or six times looking for the health pack. Sometimes I
[188.82s -> 193.30s]  don't find it because other people have the same idea. Get the assist on that heavy coming up here
[193.30s -> 198.10s]  to look for one last health pack. I get it just before this scout comes after me. Jumping around
[198.10s -> 203.22s]  the corner here. This is a great idea. Do this. Do a double jump around the side. There's a sentry
[203.22s -> 207.72s]  over there. Don't want to get myself killed so I just jump down here, shoot this scout in the face,
[207.72s -> 212.20s]  ruin his birthday party. The clown had to go home too. It's actually unfortunate. So this next part
[212.20s -> 216.04s]  is actually pretty odd. You'll see what I'm talking about. See that sentry over there?
[216.04s -> 221.64s]  I shoot it a few times and this engineer, rather than repairing it, he just destroys it. See,
[221.64s -> 225.32s]  I don't get the kill for this. Look at the top right. Nobody got the kill for it. He just destroyed
[225.32s -> 230.18s]  it and I think he put a new one down too. Kind of weird but you know people have different strategies.
[230.18s -> 234.74s]  Who knows what he was thinking? Probably trying to do something different. That's not a bad thing so
[234.74s -> 238.98s]  let's move right along here. Coming up to get the health pack like I told you guys before.
[238.98s -> 243.70s]  Jumping down to shoot this sniper in his face. Nothing he can do about it because as we all know
[243.70s -> 248.34s]  the machina what he was using cannot shoot from the hip. So even if he wanted to kill me he would
[248.34s -> 254.26s]  have to zoom in in my face. Level 1 sentry is now built up over there on the right side. Nothing I
[254.26s -> 259.70s]  can do about it so I run backwards. I'm gonna try and patrol the back area now just to make sure
[259.70s -> 264.02s]  there's only a minute left. So I want to just make sure that nobody comes around the side or around
[264.02s -> 269.22s]  the back door because Barn Blitz, the last point, has a couple of different places where you can
[269.22s -> 273.78s]  just pop out on the enemy team. So if you have a couple people on the right side and the left side
[273.78s -> 278.98s]  you'll be able to secure the last point. Get the health pack. Dancing around like a freak show.
[278.98s -> 283.70s]  Coming out here seeing if I can find somebody. I see there's a sentry and I hear the sentry as well.
[283.70s -> 288.82s]  There it is straight ahead. Try to get the milk on that soldier. Does not go well. I see a spy
[288.82s -> 291.54s]  picking up this health pack. Don't know what I'm going to do because I don't know where he is.
[291.54s -> 296.42s]  Probably a dead ringer. This is going to be the end of the gameplay. I make a pretty dumb mistake.
[296.42s -> 301.56s]  I know the sentry is out there but I'd run into it anyways. I'm just stupid. So I kill a soldier,
[301.56s -> 306.68s]  kill a sniper, get into a small scuffle with another scout. He disappears. I'm kind of like,
[306.68s -> 312.26s]  I look around like where the hell did he go? So I just run outside and get plastered by that level
[312.26s -> 317.46s]  three sentry and that's going to be the end of the gameplay. We win this game. I top frag only
[317.46s -> 322.02s]  because I was playing as a medic before. So if you're wondering how the hell did you get 40 points
[322.02s -> 327.40s]  in five minutes like that as a scout, it's because I was playing medic before. Thank you guys so much
[327.40s -> 331.96s]  for watching. I really do appreciate it. If you like this video, throw me a like, shoot me a like,
[331.96s -> 335.08s]  thanks guys. I'll see you all next time. Take care everybody.
