[0.31s -> 15.05s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 Smithsmas 2012 update.
[15.05s -> 17.75s]  Now, this is not going to cover any of the man versus machine stuff.
[17.75s -> 22.95s]  Just want to talk about the new items, the new weapons that could put into play in Team Fortress 2 with this update.
[22.95s -> 26.65s]  And they are going to start as follows. I'm going to go through three of them. It was only three.
[26.65s -> 31.75s]  I know a lot of us are kind of like, oh, what the hell, man? I want like ten new items.
[32.15s -> 35.05s]  But these items are pretty substantial.
[35.05s -> 41.25s]  These are not just reskins of a weapon or just one little stat that was added to like, you know, a shovel or something like that.
[41.25s -> 44.15s]  These are very substantial, very interesting items in their own.
[44.15s -> 50.78s]  It's going to take a while to explain at least one of them, which is the first one we're going to talk about, and that is the Vaccinator.
[50.78s -> 56.08s]  So without confusing you guys, the text on the screen right now is probably going to be pretty confusing.
[56.08s -> 62.58s]  Now, let me, without reading a ton of the text and trying to, you know, read you the stats and all that, let me just say what this thing does.
[62.58s -> 66.88s]  This is a specific uber-charging medigun.
[66.88s -> 71.88s]  What that means is that it's going to protect people from specific types of damage.
[71.88s -> 77.78s]  So me healing this heavy right now, just without the uber, me and him take 10% less bullet damage.
[77.78s -> 80.68s]  That's stuff like the Scout Scouter Gun. That's the minigun.
[80.68s -> 85.41s]  Stuff that is actually classified as a bullet, we take 10% less of.
[85.41s -> 93.01s]  Now, I can change that. I can change it from bullet damage to blast damage or fire damage with the number 4.
[93.01s -> 96.91s]  I believe it defaults to number 4 is how you switch this.
[96.91s -> 98.51s]  So let's say I hit number 4 right now.
[98.51s -> 100.21s]  I'm going to switch over to blast damage.
[100.21s -> 103.01s]  If I hit 4 again, I'm going to switch over to fire damage.
[103.01s -> 105.71s]  10%, it never changes from 10%.
[105.71s -> 108.11s]  We both just take 10% less damage.
[108.11s -> 110.61s]  Now, let's talk about the uber-charge.
[110.61s -> 113.31s]  This is where it gets a little bit crazy and a little bit weird.
[113.31s -> 118.01s]  If you look in the lower right, there are four squares there, four different quadrants.
[118.01s -> 121.61s]  Each one of those is a two second uber.
[121.61s -> 123.81s]  You don't have to use the whole uber.
[123.81s -> 125.81s]  We've been waiting for something like this for a long time.
[125.81s -> 130.21s]  I remember people talking about in the comments, like a year ago on one of my minigun videos,
[130.21s -> 134.71s]  talking about how cool it would be to have an uber that you could use halfway through.
[134.71s -> 136.61s]  Like, oh, I filled my uber up to 20%.
[136.61s -> 138.51s]  I can use 20% of that uber.
[138.51s -> 140.61s]  They put that in the game now.
[140.61s -> 142.01s]  It's actually a thing.
[142.01s -> 144.81s]  So regardless of how many quadrants you have filled,
[144.81s -> 148.29s]  you can either use one of them, two of them, or all of them.
[148.29s -> 151.19s]  You can use all four by holding down the right click,
[151.19s -> 154.89s]  or you can just right click one time and just suck down one of those quadrants.
[154.89s -> 156.99s]  So here is what the uber-charge actually does.
[156.99s -> 159.39s]  When you uber-charge, you probably have seen it already on the screen.
[159.39s -> 161.79s]  It's going to put somebody in a little bubble.
[161.79s -> 163.49s]  They do not, it's not invincibility.
[163.49s -> 164.89s]  It is not invincibility.
[164.89s -> 167.39s]  What happens is, whatever you have selected,
[167.39s -> 170.79s]  whether that's bullet damage, fire damage, or blast damage,
[170.79s -> 176.19s]  you and that person are going to take 75%, not 10%,
[176.19s -> 181.89s]  75% less damage of that damage type until you're done ubering them
[181.89s -> 184.19s]  or you change to a different target.
[184.19s -> 187.89s]  Also, on top of this, while you are uber-charging somebody,
[187.89s -> 189.49s]  whatever you have selected for the resistance,
[189.49s -> 191.59s]  let's say you have the bullet damage selected.
[191.59s -> 193.69s]  If your target is taking bullet damage,
[193.69s -> 198.09s]  you get healed for 25% of that incoming bullet damage
[198.09s -> 199.87s]  while they are uber-charged.
[199.97s -> 201.57s]  And talking about just pure stats,
[201.57s -> 204.77s]  this thing has a 50% faster uber-charge rate,
[204.77s -> 206.87s]  which means you'll be getting charges more often.
[206.87s -> 210.27s]  But, and this is a pretty big deal because it's not the quick fix.
[210.27s -> 211.97s]  This is not the quick fix.
[211.97s -> 217.01s]  It can do overhealing, but it overheals 66% slower.
[217.01s -> 218.91s]  There's a lot going on with this gun.
[218.91s -> 220.61s]  There's a lot going on with this Medigun.
[220.61s -> 223.71s]  And hopefully, I could break it down a little bit for you there
[223.71s -> 225.41s]  and go play with it, go have fun with it, guys.
[225.41s -> 227.01s]  This thing is crazy.
[227.01s -> 228.61s]  But now, let's move on to the next thing.
[228.61s -> 232.80s]  Let's move on to the Demoman's new grenade launcher, the Loose Cannon.
[232.80s -> 234.90s]  So this thing is a primary slot replacement,
[234.90s -> 237.70s]  and I guess I can describe this in one way.
[237.70s -> 241.80s]  It's the baby of two items that are already in this game.
[241.80s -> 243.90s]  If you know the Detonator from the Pyro
[243.90s -> 246.10s]  and the Beggar's Bazooka from the Soldier,
[246.10s -> 247.60s]  they got together and had a kid.
[247.60s -> 250.20s]  It's this. This is the Beggar's Bazooka Detonator.
[250.20s -> 253.20s]  If that makes any sense at all, let me try to explain.
[253.20s -> 255.10s]  So the thing shoots cannonballs first off the bat.
[255.10s -> 256.90s]  Let's just say that. That's awesome.
[256.90s -> 258.40s]  And they roll around.
[258.40s -> 260.90s]  Now, if a cannonball hits the ground,
[260.90s -> 265.20s]  it's going to do 50% less damage than if it was not on the ground.
[265.20s -> 267.20s]  So anytime you hit a surface or you hit the ground,
[267.20s -> 268.70s]  it's going to do a lot less damage.
[268.70s -> 272.10s]  But if you hit somebody with the cannonball,
[272.10s -> 273.50s]  it can go through people.
[273.50s -> 276.40s]  You can actually hit people with the cannonball,
[276.40s -> 279.30s]  and it'll go through a line of people.
[279.30s -> 281.10s]  It also knocks people around,
[281.10s -> 283.60s]  and you can detonate this thing in the air.
[283.60s -> 285.90s]  That's what I talked about the Detonator and the Beggar's Bazooka.
[285.90s -> 287.70s]  Because you hold the button down,
[287.80s -> 289.80s]  and on the lower right, you're going to see a bar.
[289.80s -> 294.10s]  When that bar gets to be about 50% or 30% of the way you let go,
[294.10s -> 296.60s]  the thing is going to detonate somewhere in the air,
[296.60s -> 298.70s]  depending how long you held it down for.
[298.70s -> 301.00s]  Now, it can blow up in your face.
[301.00s -> 302.70s]  That's where the Beggar's Bazooka comes in.
[302.70s -> 304.40s]  If you hold it down too long,
[304.40s -> 306.70s]  it's just going to blow up in your face and you're going to take damage.
[306.70s -> 309.90s]  But it's very, very fun to try and knock people around with this thing,
[309.90s -> 312.40s]  and shoot this into a hallway with a bunch of people,
[312.40s -> 314.00s]  you're going to knock it into so many people
[314.00s -> 315.60s]  because the cannonball does damage.
[315.60s -> 318.90s]  So, I don't know right now how this weapon is going to, you know,
[318.90s -> 321.80s]  be on the list of are these things worth equipping,
[321.80s -> 322.70s]  but it's pretty fun.
[322.70s -> 326.09s]  I will tell you right now, it's very, very fun just to play around with.
[326.09s -> 329.39s]  So, let's move on to the third and last weapon of this update,
[329.39s -> 333.09s]  and it is the Rescue Ranger, probably my favorite one so far,
[333.09s -> 337.79s]  because it answers the prayers of a lot of big Sentry Engineer users,
[337.79s -> 341.69s]  and that is, I wish I could move away from my Sentry Nest
[341.69s -> 344.09s]  and not have to worry about everything exploding
[344.09s -> 346.49s]  and all my work being thrown down the toilet.
[346.49s -> 350.09s]  What this thing does, it's a ranged Sentry Healer.
[350.09s -> 354.39s]  Not only is it a projectile shotgun, but it's a ranged Sentry Healer.
[354.39s -> 356.59s]  It's going to heal your Sentry from any range,
[356.59s -> 359.99s]  you could be 5,000 feet down the road or right next to it,
[359.99s -> 361.89s]  you shoot it with the shotgun a couple times,
[361.89s -> 364.39s]  bada bing bada boom, your Sentry is healed.
[364.39s -> 366.99s]  Now, it's very, very, very important to say this,
[366.99s -> 371.69s]  this is not going to replenish ammo into your Sentry or rockets,
[371.69s -> 374.89s]  and this will not remove sappers.
[374.89s -> 375.99s]  That's a big deal.
[375.99s -> 380.69s]  So, this thing cannot remove sappers or replace ammo into your gun,
[380.69s -> 382.69s]  it can only heal the Sentry.
[382.69s -> 385.19s]  So, is this thing worth putting on?
[385.19s -> 388.69s]  I'm going to say absolutely yes, because I didn't even talk about the second
[388.69s -> 392.12s]  and probably the best feature of this item.
[392.12s -> 397.92s]  This allows you to pick up your Sentry gun from anywhere on the map,
[397.92s -> 401.32s]  as long as you can see the damn Sentry gun.
[401.32s -> 404.92s]  So, I can be standing all the way across Dust Bowl,
[404.92s -> 408.42s]  and right-click and teleport the Sentry into my hands.
[408.42s -> 411.42s]  Now, when you do that, you are going to be marked for death,
[411.42s -> 414.02s]  but it's a huge upside.
[414.02s -> 416.72s]  That's not even really a downside to me, in my opinion,
[416.72s -> 419.32s]  because you can get your Sentry gun out of so much trouble.
[419.32s -> 421.12s]  If you see somebody coming around the corner,
[421.12s -> 422.72s]  if you know the thing is going to die,
[422.72s -> 425.32s]  you can teleport it to you and run backwards back to the next point
[425.32s -> 427.72s]  or back to the next checkpoint for the payload cart.
[427.72s -> 429.32s]  It is unbelievable.
[429.32s -> 433.62s]  It does take 130 metal to do that, but my goodness gracious,
[433.62s -> 436.12s]  that is one of the coolest things I've ever seen in this game.
[436.12s -> 439.22s]  So, yes, I'm going to say absolutely go try this and go put it on.
[439.22s -> 442.12s]  And the downsides, the real downsides of this item
[442.12s -> 446.60s]  are lower clip size and lower maximum ammo capacity.
[446.60s -> 447.70s]  Like, who cares?
[447.70s -> 451.18s]  Like, this thing is ridiculous. Go put it on.
[451.18s -> 453.38s]  So, that is going to wrap up this video, guys.
[453.38s -> 455.88s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[455.88s -> 458.78s]  And stay tuned for the Man vs. Machine counterpart
[458.78s -> 461.98s]  of this update little series on Smith's Miss 2012
[461.98s -> 463.38s]  coming in the next couple of days.
[463.38s -> 464.68s]  So, I'll see you guys all soon.
[464.68s -> 466.68s]  And of course, take care everybody.
[466.68s -> 467.88s]  Have fun with the new weapons.
