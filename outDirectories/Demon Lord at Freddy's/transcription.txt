[7.03s -> 14.87s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? It's me Demon Lord Xaraxos here. You're probably wondering where's
[14.87s -> 19.99s]  Jerma? What happened to him? How come he's not doing this video? Well, it's because I have taken
[19.99s -> 27.27s]  over his soul, and I will only release it after playing around a Five Nights at Freddy's. Because
[27.27s -> 34.55s]  everyone wants to see Five Nights at Freddy's, and who better than me, the Lord of all Hells and
[34.55s -> 41.27s]  demons and hatred? I'm not scared of anything. What could I possibly be afraid of in this little
[41.27s -> 46.15s]  shit game? I don't know. We'll find out very shortly. Let's go ahead and play a new game.
[53.96s -> 62.47s]  This guy sounds kind of like an asshole. I'm gonna ignore him. Let's go camera 4B. That's what we're on.
[64.02s -> 78.79s]  Camera 5. Okay, 12 a.m. There's a bird. I don't like birds. Okay, camera 1A. Camera 7.
[85.29s -> 94.87s]  I can close the door. What the fuck was that? Okay, well that was a little weird. That was like a bird
[94.87s -> 100.23s]  in my face. I wasn't scared. I was not scared of that. I was just startled that it had jumped up
[100.23s -> 106.23s]  at me and scared me, so obviously that'll scare you. I don't think that I was scared, though,
[106.23s -> 110.71s]  because you were scared. I wasn't the one that was scared. It was you, actually.
[110.71s -> 120.38s]  And you look like there's a blinking light over there now. Freddy. Oh, Freddy. Where are you,
[120.38s -> 129.26s]  Freddy? You can't hide from demon lord Xaraxos. I will boil you. I will eat your flesh and tear
[129.26s -> 137.18s]  off the bones and use them as toothpicks in my stew. If you think I'm going to be scared of your...
[137.18s -> 143.34s]  One of them is missing. Okay, one of them is missing. Now, there was a rhinoceros that was
[143.34s -> 151.18s]  here before, and he just ain't here. This bear might have moved. I might have seen him somewhere.
[151.18s -> 156.30s]  I don't know. Pirate Cove is out of order. Let's just go back and make sure there's nobody
[157.02s -> 162.38s]  potentially trying to kill me, but I will kill them first. That's what you need to remember
[162.38s -> 168.44s]  from this whole thing. I will kill them first before they try to kill me. There is a guy standing
[168.44s -> 175.90s]  there. There is a guy in a funny little suit standing there now, and I don't really know what
[175.90s -> 185.13s]  to do. Should I... He's still there. Okay. I hear music. No, no, the night's almost over. I only have
[185.13s -> 190.25s]  3% power, so that means the cameras are all going to turn off, and we're going to all go to sleep,
[190.25s -> 200.34s]  and it's going to be a nice, fun day at Freddy's Pizza Place Pizzeria, right? What the hell's that?
[200.34s -> 207.67s]  What the hell's going on? What the hell's going on? It's time to open the store. The pizzas are
[207.67s -> 221.26s]  opening. Why would you work here? Who would work at an establishment where you could actually get
[221.26s -> 227.40s]  killed by the people, the participants in the suits? I don't know why you would ever do such a
[227.40s -> 233.85s]  thing. You come work for me. At least there's benefits down in hell. You know, you get a good
[233.85s -> 240.17s]  dental plan. No, no, it's pretty good. You know, we're going to continue. I'm going to get... I
[240.17s -> 247.03s]  don't even know what the goal here is. I do not see him anywhere. Where is he? He's in the kitchen.
[247.03s -> 254.58s]  He's in the kitchen. The son of a bitch is in the kitchen. That means... Is he coming out here?
[255.46s -> 261.21s]  Yeah, he's in the kitchen. No, he's in this one. Okay, now he's right here. He's going to be right
[261.21s -> 268.47s]  here. No, he's not right here. Where is he? Oh, he's right... Okay, he's right here. He's literally
[268.47s -> 275.58s]  staring at me. It's 4 a.m. Don't let them come in. Do not let them come in. Is the door locked?
[275.58s -> 283.62s]  Both the doors are closed. You stay where you are. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
[283.70s -> 295.61s]  hey. None of that. We're not gonna have any of that. Oh, boy. This is closed. We're at 4 a.m. now.
[295.61s -> 301.70s]  Just got to get through the night. No, no, I got through the night. I did it. I was staring... I got
[301.70s -> 308.49s]  through the night. This is... Come on, we won. I won the game. Did I not win the game? Are you telling
[308.49s -> 317.22s]  me I didn't win the game? I was staring at him. What the hell? Oh, boo, here he comes. He's gonna
[317.22s -> 333.26s]  come. Oh, oh, boy. Don't get scared. Oh, you know what? I'm just... I'm just gonna go play Super
[333.26s -> 341.48s]  Mario Brothers because that game... I don't want to play this anymore. Jerma, Jerma, your soul is now
[341.48s -> 350.02s]  free. I'm releasing you. Why? Whoa, where... What happened? Well, just calm down, calm down.
[350.02s -> 354.82s]  Everything's okay. Everything's all right. I have it under control. I stole your soul so I can come
[354.82s -> 359.78s]  to earth to play Five Nights at Freddy's. What?
