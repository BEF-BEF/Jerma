[0.31s -> 14.53s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jirban here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.53s -> 22.88s]  And tonight, I'm gonna be playing as the Soldier with the black box, the Conqueror, and the halfs of Taichi.
[22.88s -> 29.88s]  And tonight we're gonna talk about some stuff today, not really to do with the Soldier, or really to do with TF2 that much.
[29.88s -> 33.88s]  But we're gonna talk about it regardless. And before I even get started, I wanna make a couple of points here.
[33.88s -> 39.88s]  Number one, Happy New Year. Happy New Year, it's 2014, probably when you're watching this. I don't know when it's gonna get uploaded.
[39.88s -> 45.88s]  It'll probably get uploaded either a few hours before New Year's, or a day after New Year's Eve, or something.
[45.88s -> 50.88s]  I don't know, but regardless, Happy New Year, welcome to 2014. And we'll move on from that.
[50.88s -> 57.12s]  Hopefully you saw the ball drop. Hopefully my balls dropped. They already did. I did hit puberty already.
[57.12s -> 64.30s]  So secondly, if you happen to miss the Grandpa Christmas Story, which was an animation, it was a fully animated short,
[64.30s -> 70.30s]  that was animated by my buddy Blordow, I highly suggest you go check it out. There's gonna be a link in the description.
[70.30s -> 74.47s]  If you did happen to miss it, that's pretty much all I wanna say, because I wanna give that more attention.
[74.47s -> 78.47s]  I feel like a lot of people just kinda skipped over it, because it was like, oh, well, I don't even know what the fuck this is,
[78.47s -> 82.47s]  so I'm just not gonna watch it. But it's there in the description. Please go give it some love.
[82.47s -> 91.14s]  And now, we can talk about the actual point of this video. The whole reason why I decided to make this video has to do with money.
[91.14s -> 95.14s]  We're gonna talk about cash. We're gonna talk about paper in this video. We're gonna talk about that real cheddar cheese.
[95.14s -> 100.14s]  So sit back and relax, and open the discussion up in the comments section if you wanna add to this.
[100.14s -> 104.14s]  But it's gonna talk about gaming money. It's not like in-game currency.
[104.14s -> 113.14s]  It's gonna talk about gaming and the monetary value of games, and how it's really changed a lot in the last few years.
[113.14s -> 116.14s]  It has changed insanely in the last few years.
[116.14s -> 124.64s]  Hop in a time machine with me. Let's go inside Jerma's big fat hot tub time machine, and let's go back to a time in the mid to late 90s.
[124.64s -> 131.64s]  We're gonna go to like 1995 or 1996, when the cartridge consoles were kind of still relevant.
[131.64s -> 134.64s]  We're gonna talk about like Nintendo 64.
[134.64s -> 142.01s]  Those of us that are old enough to remember going into the stores and buying games or being young and having your parents buy.
[142.01s -> 144.01s]  Like, I want that one. Okay, honey. I love you.
[144.01s -> 152.16s]  You will remember Cartridge Games GoldenEye 007 was $79.
[152.16s -> 161.16s]  It was $80 fucking dollars off the shelf retail at a place like a GameStop or electronics boutique, I think is what it used to be called.
[161.16s -> 164.66s]  We were totally okay with paying that.
[164.66s -> 168.66s]  I never saw a complaint of anybody really talking about how that's not worth it.
[168.66s -> 175.66s]  Oh my god, $80. I'm gonna fight the system. No goddamn way I'm paying $80 for GoldenEye.
[175.66s -> 181.66s]  Everybody did it because that's just what it cost. That's what the games costed back then, especially if it was a cartridge.
[181.66s -> 189.01s]  Now, you can get out of my time machine. We can go back to like 2012, 2013, 14, whatever year you want to say it is.
[189.01s -> 198.79s]  And if a game was gonna cost $80 nowadays, that thing had better have some goddamn collector's edition shit inside of that box.
[198.79s -> 204.79s]  You better open that box and there's like a little figurine of Solid Snake and he has a button on his arm and you hit it and you go to Kung Fu Action.
[204.79s -> 210.79s]  Like, there better be that in that goddamn box or you're gonna be pissed off if the game is $80 at retail.
[210.79s -> 214.46s]  And I was thinking about this the other day. What happened?
[214.46s -> 219.70s]  Why did we just become not okay with paying that much money for a video game?
[219.70s -> 223.70s]  And now I'm not saying that that's that, oh man, I wish games were $80 still.
[223.70s -> 227.70s]  No, no. God, no, because that would suck because I spend so much money on games to begin with.
[227.70s -> 231.70s]  I'm glad that games are a lot cheaper now, especially if you're on PC.
[231.70s -> 237.70s]  If you're on console, you're still looking at about like $50 to $60 for every pretty much major retail release.
[237.70s -> 245.70s]  But on PC, we have the Steam sales, the Stales, we have the Steam sales, we have Amazon, we have get a good old games.
[245.70s -> 250.88s]  We have a lot of places that give us high discounts on games, but the point still stands.
[250.88s -> 255.88s]  Nobody is really willing to pay $80 anymore for a default standard game.
[255.88s -> 262.88s]  Now you can go to the manufacturing side of things and say, well, Jerma, the reason why they are not $80 anymore
[262.88s -> 267.88s]  is because cartridges were crazy expensive to make and discs are a lot cheaper.
[267.88s -> 269.88s]  Yeah, that makes a whole lot of sense. That does make sense.
[269.88s -> 278.92s]  But people are really, really hesitant nowadays to spend even like $15 to $20 on a game now that's new.
[278.92s -> 283.92s]  I'm guilty of doing this. I am guilty myself of doing this, and I'm trying to figure out why this is.
[283.92s -> 287.92s]  A game will come out on Steam that I know is supposed to be pretty good.
[287.92s -> 291.92s]  I've seen reviews on it. I've heard people talk about it, and it's like $25.
[291.92s -> 298.16s]  And I'm sitting there in my chair going, it's a little too, it's a little fucking expensive, ain't it?
[298.16s -> 302.16s]  And then I go back in time and I'm like, wait, I used to spend $80 on games.
[302.16s -> 305.16s]  What am I talking about? Why is that such a big deal?
[305.16s -> 315.16s]  Why is a game being like $17 or $16, $15, whatever your regional equivalent is, why is that such a big deal now?
[315.16s -> 316.16s]  I don't know.
[316.16s -> 322.66s]  And especially considering that graphical fidelity in games has gone really through the roof in the last 10 to 20 years.
[322.66s -> 326.66s]  You guys remember like Tomb Raider, remember old PlayStation 1 Tomb Raider
[326.66s -> 328.66s]  with like the triangle block boobs?
[328.66s -> 332.66s]  Like that's an iconic picture when you're talking about graphical fidelity.
[332.66s -> 339.09s]  But I know most of these games that come out nowadays are a little less graphical fidelity.
[339.09s -> 345.09s]  They're very retro. They're very stylized. They're not so much, hey, look at our crazy graphics engine as it is.
[345.09s -> 348.09s]  Hey, look at this fun gameplay that I created. I understand that.
[348.09s -> 351.46s]  But I'm just trying to piece the pieces together.
[351.46s -> 353.46s]  And if you guys have any ideas in the comments, please let me know.
[353.46s -> 359.46s]  But why are we okay with paying that much money back then but not okay with it now?
[359.46s -> 362.46s]  I guess that's the question of the video.
[362.46s -> 364.63s]  So that's going to wrap it up, guys. I hope you enjoyed.
[364.63s -> 366.63s]  I'll see you guys all next time.
[366.63s -> 367.63s]  Thank you so much for watching.
[367.63s -> 368.63s]  That's going to wrap up the video.
[368.63s -> 375.78s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
[375.78s -> 379.78s]  You probably expected a weird sound sometimes like I do at the end of my videos.
[379.78s -> 381.02s]  I don't know.
[381.02s -> 382.02s]  Kind of got old.
