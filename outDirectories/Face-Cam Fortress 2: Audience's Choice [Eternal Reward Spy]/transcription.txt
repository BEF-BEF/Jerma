[0.31s -> 14.34s]  Hey, yo, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, Monday's edition.
[14.34s -> 18.40s]  See if I can't hop over and kill this scout from behind to get my first disguise with
[18.40s -> 29.05s]  the Eternal Reward. Oh my god, I'm like burping and stabbing. Stab! Stab! Playing as the spy
[29.05s -> 33.17s]  as you can tell. With the, I'll show you the loadout because the loadout is actually pretty
[33.17s -> 39.22s]  important thing to talk about. The Diamondback, the Eternal Reward, and the Cloak in Dagger.
[39.22s -> 46.54s]  This was picked by the live stream last night during my choose your own adventure polling
[46.54s -> 50.78s]  live stream, which was actually pretty fun. I can't wait to do that again because there's
[50.78s -> 55.14s]  more interesting things that could be done. But let's get right into this here. Let's
[55.14s -> 64.51s]  see if we can't. Give me another one. Oh, what? He died before I could kill him. Here's the
[64.51s -> 71.50s]  good thing about the Cloak in Dagger. Ready? You can just sit here. I love it. I can make
[71.50s -> 77.99s]  a sandwich. I can drink some Dr. Pepper. I had an opportunity to kill that Pyro, but
[77.99s -> 83.68s]  you know what? Sometimes Dr. Pepper is more important. How come I didn't? Oh, that's right.
[83.68s -> 91.10s]  You can't run over ammo and get refilled. Yeah! Give me the health. Health. Health. Health.
[91.10s -> 94.49s]  Maybe the doctor can heal me. Thank you, doctor. Why did I pick up that health? That was a
[94.49s -> 99.94s]  bad move. So I want to talk about Dr. Pepper for a second because it's kind of a split.
[99.94s -> 105.15s]  There's a 50-50 split between people liking Dr. Pepper and people hating Dr. Pepper. Now
[105.15s -> 109.15s]  I'm one of those people that, as you can tell, absolutely loves the soft drink. And no,
[109.15s -> 114.09s]  I'm not being paid by them. I wish I was. That would be pretty cool if it was like,
[114.09s -> 118.57s]  hey, Jerma, we're Dr. Pepper. We know you love our drinks. We're going to give you a
[118.57s -> 124.98s]  thousand cases of Dr. Pepper. I'd be like, shine me up, dude. But that's probably never
[124.98s -> 129.54s]  going to happen. So that's wishful thinking. But if you think a couple of people in the
[129.54s -> 134.46s]  comments said, Jerma, I hate Dr. Pepper and I hope you don't hate me. No, no, no. I know
[134.46s -> 140.39s]  that it's a very, it's a very polarizing soda. And I've just been walking around in circles.
[140.39s -> 149.71s]  No, I'm real. Look, see, I'm real. Nice job, scout. Nice job. High five. If I had the high
[149.71s -> 155.83s]  fives on, I would just use it right there. But Dr. Pepper, best drink ever in my opinion. And
[155.83s -> 160.26s]  well, we're going to win this. They can't even get on the point. Damn. Maybe I should switch
[160.26s -> 170.34s]  teams. No, I'll stay here for now. That's just, I just knocked this guy off. Gotcha. Come on.
[170.34s -> 179.48s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Are you seeing this? Heavy, heavy, heavy. Face
[179.48s -> 188.02s]  stab. Diamondback is not a great option here because there's no engineers early on the other
[188.02s -> 196.54s]  team. I'll take that though. I'll take that. Let's try and hide somewhere. Whoa. Is that real? Did
[196.54s -> 201.30s]  I make it to my own spawn? I'm like, Oh, I'm at their spawn. I'm not even. Yeah, I made it to my
[201.30s -> 209.82s]  own spawn. Hey, look at that. My own spawn. Hey, spawn. Two, three. So let's do another round.
[210.10s -> 218.05s]  All right. So we change maps. We end up on nucleus. That's okay with me. I thought that guy was
[218.05s -> 224.50s]  going to jump down. I got him regardless. It's okay. No, no, I just got a disguise. Oh, button
[224.50s -> 231.66s]  buddy. Bonzi buddy. Does anybody remember Bonzi buddy? That's a very old internet term. I'm not
[231.66s -> 238.96s]  sure if any of you guys might remember that old school, like 56 K 28.8 K dial up users will know
[238.96s -> 247.84s]  who Bonzi buddy is. Oh, there's a mini century now. Eternal reward is going to be not so good.
[247.84s -> 259.80s]  But if I can come here, you got him. He had crits too. He's going to be really mad. That is
[259.80s -> 265.50s]  definitely a spy. I could probably guess. Now he probably thinks I'm a spy. Spies everywhere.
[265.50s -> 274.54s]  Spyception. All right. Got my gunslinger out. Let's do this boys. Gunslinger. Hey scout, come
[274.54s -> 280.81s]  back here. I want to talk to you for a sec. Hey scout, I want to talk to you too. Oh, okay. I was
[280.81s -> 290.44s]  going to say that made the stabbing noise. That guy. It's okay. Run. Everybody's chasing.
[290.44s -> 301.15s]  Everybody's chasing. Jeez. I have an opportunity here. No, it's okay. Now I have an opportunity.
[301.15s -> 310.78s]  Oh, this. No. Get the hells. Get the. All right. Both my fingers just almost went up my nose. I
[310.78s -> 317.02s]  almost just freaked out. I almost went. That would have been bad. That would have not made for a good
[317.02s -> 324.14s]  face cam video. Maybe it would have. You know, who knows? All right. We're going to get. That's a
[324.14s -> 336.27s]  spy. At least I got his disguise. Hey, how are you? How's the wife and kids? Now would be a pretty
[336.27s -> 343.98s]  good time to utilize the diamond back. Never. I will never get it. I will never get a stair stab.
[343.98s -> 357.53s]  I probably should have waited a little longer. Oh. The unwanted FX. The X edition. Let's go.
[357.57s -> 365.94s]  Let's respawn. I'm going to go down here this time because the left area is giving me a little bit
[365.94s -> 376.90s]  of trouble. Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody. A lot of people here. Here's the only chance I'm
[376.90s -> 382.15s]  going to get. I don't want him to put another sentry down. Wait till this pyro gets out of here.
[382.15s -> 389.98s]  I'm doing a whole lot of sitting still here. Here it is. Three in a row right here. One, two,
[389.98s -> 402.68s]  three. Now here's the question. Can I get. Oh, I thought that was a sticky from the other team.
[405.54s -> 411.41s]  Oh, I wanted to get that. Hi. How are you? I'm probably disguised as you. Totally. Yeah, I am.
[411.41s -> 418.01s]  No, there's nothing I can do. Nothing I can do. Try and make the jump. Make the jump. Oh. Did he
[418.01s -> 429.62s]  follow me? He did. He followed me. Oh, God. That was a lot of luck in that came into play. I need
[429.62s -> 441.99s]  the health now. Hoo. Boy, oh boy. That is a spy scout. If I've ever seen one in my life. No,
[443.03s -> 452.09s]  I thought he just jumped to his own death. Does he have the. He might have the. No, he's not real.
[456.12s -> 462.68s]  You know what? I will accept that death because I got killed by Marlon Brando 57. Marlon Brando. M
[462.68s -> 473.30s]  Brando. I love that name. Now here's the funny thing. His name might be like Matt Brandio,
[473.30s -> 482.46s]  not Marlon Brando, but that's what I saw. We better get him off of this. No, I can't go over
[482.46s -> 493.70s]  there. Minicentury. Curse you. Curse you, Minicentury. They're gonna get it. I do not approve of that.
[493.70s -> 511.56s]  Get the scout right here. No, get him. Gonna get a crit. I'll take a crit. Somebody come out of the
[511.56s -> 517.27s]  spawn. Let's end this. Oh, it's gonna end it right there. Might as well just use it up because I'm
[517.27s -> 526.12s]  gonna die anyways. And we got it anyways, right? Right? Right? Oh, yeah. All right. That's gonna
[526.12s -> 534.31s]  wrap it up. Thank you so much for watching, guys. I really appreciate it. And cheers. Cheers, mate.
[534.31s -> 537.35s]  See you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
