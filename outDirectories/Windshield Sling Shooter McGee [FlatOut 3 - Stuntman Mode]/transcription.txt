[0.31s -> 14.14s]  Some of these characters are so stupid.
[14.14s -> 16.57s]  I'll definitely be in this guy.
[16.57s -> 19.57s]  Oh my god, it's Zario.
[19.57s -> 24.00s]  I wonder why this guy's name is Zario.
[24.00s -> 26.43s]  Might have something to do with it. He looks like-
[26.43s -> 28.43s]  He even does a Super Mario jump!
[28.43s -> 29.43s]  Did you see that shit?
[29.43s -> 33.50s]  He just did the Super Mario jump!
[33.50s -> 35.50s]  I'm not sure if you're talking to me or talking to everyone else.
[35.50s -> 38.50s]  Watch out for the copyright infringed copyright strike.
[38.50s -> 42.26s]  The evil windmill.
[42.26s -> 43.26s]  Are you ready?
[43.26s -> 44.26s]  I'm gonna destroy you.
[44.26s -> 46.26s]  Is it my turn first? Who goes first? Me?
[46.26s -> 48.44s]  Uh, we're both here.
[48.44s -> 49.44s]  Oh, well I'm going.
[49.44s -> 51.32s]  What?
[54.84s -> 57.84s]  You didn't make it uphill. Okay, my turn.
[57.84s -> 59.84s]  You used your turn.
[62.84s -> 65.66s]  Wait, it says press the en-
[65.66s -> 67.66s]  Wait, what?
[73.39s -> 74.39s]  What?
[74.39s -> 80.47s]  What is the goal of this?
[80.47s -> 83.06s]  I don't know.
[83.06s -> 86.06s]  Get hit by the windmill a million times, probably?
[86.06s -> 92.08s]  Got it.
[92.08s -> 100.68s]  I can't believe that actually happened.
[100.68s -> 102.92s]  It's a me, Mario.
[102.92s -> 105.48s]  It's a me, Zario.
[105.48s -> 108.94s]  Industrial realism.
[108.94s -> 109.94s]  Highway.
[109.94s -> 113.14s]  Study each map for the goal.
[113.14s -> 116.31s]  Please tell me this car is just coming forward at all times.
[116.31s -> 120.38s]  Please. Please.
[120.38s -> 121.38s]  No.
[121.38s -> 123.38s]  Damn it, why is it called highway then?
[123.38s -> 127.55s]  Because we have to jump onto this freaking highway.
[127.55s -> 129.30s]  What?
[129.30s -> 131.70s]  What?
[131.70s -> 135.00s]  Yeah, again, you're supposed to eject before you hit it, I guess.
[135.00s -> 136.00s]  That's what I did.
[136.00s -> 138.00s]  I didn't.
[140.24s -> 141.24s]  It's a me!
[141.24s -> 145.76s]  What do you mean find the goal? We're just ejecting out of the cars.
[145.76s -> 148.38s]  What is this?
[148.38s -> 149.38s]  I have no idea.
[149.38s -> 152.29s]  I'm kind of-
[152.29s -> 155.29s]  Alright, wait, study the map, study the-
[155.29s -> 162.65s]  We were supposed to study the map.
[162.65s -> 164.65s]  I tried to study it.
[164.65s -> 169.40s]  Study the map and get the most out of your experience.
[169.40s -> 173.30s]  Well, I'm going to try and make this jump right now.
[173.30s -> 174.54s]  Alright, me too.
[182.16s -> 188.37s]  Why does this have a 23 on Medicare?
[188.37s -> 190.37s]  This is the best game I've ever played.
[190.37s -> 192.57s]  Hit him high.
[192.57s -> 196.15s]  I have a fucking headache, dude.
[196.15s -> 201.15s]  When we were tapping triangle, you know what cartridge tilting is?
[201.15s -> 202.52s]  Yeah.
[202.52s -> 203.52s]  That's what was happening.
[203.52s -> 207.52s]  My character was stretching and it was fucking horrific.
[207.52s -> 208.52s]  Look at them balls.
[208.52s -> 210.52s]  Oh man, this is going to be sick.
[210.52s -> 212.34s]  What do you even do?
[212.34s -> 213.34s]  Let's just go at the same time.
[213.34s -> 214.34s]  Speed up.
[214.34s -> 215.34s]  Don't, don't, don't.
[215.34s -> 217.34s]  We have to study and survey the area.
[217.34s -> 218.34s]  No.
[218.34s -> 219.34s]  Didn't you read?
[226.63s -> 228.63s]  What happened to all of my momentum?
[228.63s -> 230.63s]  It just went straight up.
[235.64s -> 236.64s]  I can't.
[236.64s -> 237.64s]  Still.
[237.64s -> 238.64s]  Dude, your car.
[238.64s -> 240.64s]  You should have seen your car.
[240.64s -> 245.50s]  You should have seen-
[245.50s -> 248.74s]  You should have seen what your car did.
[248.74s -> 255.70s]  Your car.
[255.70s -> 258.33s]  I'll make sure I get over this one.
[258.33s -> 260.33s]  This time I'm going to get four million points.
[260.33s -> 261.33s]  Yeah.
[261.33s -> 263.33s]  Come at me, bro.
[263.33s -> 265.33s]  I'm coming at the hill.
[265.33s -> 269.42s]  Get up there.
[269.42s -> 271.42s]  Oh, baby.
[271.42s -> 273.42s]  Oh, baby.
[273.42s -> 275.42s]  Oh, baby.
[275.42s -> 276.42s]  Oh, baby.
[276.42s -> 277.42s]  What?
[277.42s -> 279.79s]  This will be the last one.
[279.79s -> 283.79s]  I feel like, I feel like we've gotten the fly out of car thing out of our system.
[283.79s -> 286.70s]  Sort of.
[286.70s -> 287.70s]  Yeah.
[290.45s -> 291.75s]  Okay, four.
[291.75s -> 293.75s]  Score a thousand points.
[293.75s -> 296.70s]  One thousand points.
[296.70s -> 297.70s]  Four.
[297.70s -> 298.70s]  Four.
[298.70s -> 299.70s]  Four.
[299.70s -> 300.70s]  Four.
[300.70s -> 301.70s]  Four.
