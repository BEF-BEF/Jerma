[1.85s -> 7.30s]  What an awful name. All right, save her color. I want that to be green like Luke Skywalker.
[8.89s -> 10.89s]  All right, let's see if there's any weirder ones.
[11.69s -> 21.58s]  This guy's all ugly. I think it's gonna be that guy. What is this like photoshopped Darth Vader?
[24.44s -> 28.44s]  This guy looks like somebody photoshopped Darth Vader's face on like a cookie.
[40.70s -> 43.02s]  Where I don't- where are you? You're not even in here. Oh, there you are.
[47.42s -> 50.10s]  Yeah
[50.42s -> 53.96s]  Oh damn, how are you still alive?
[55.16s -> 59.32s]  That's not how this game works. This is fucking bullshit. Why are you still alive? That's not how this game works.
[59.40s -> 63.40s]  What do you mean? That's not how the game works. I was putting a lightsaber through your body and you would stand-
[65.05s -> 67.05s]  I just feel like we're both shit faced.
[70.60s -> 75.32s]  Did we both- did we both share a bottle of Jameson before we decided to play this? Like seriously.
[77.40s -> 79.88s]  All right, this is- this is stupid.
[81.67s -> 83.67s]  This is stupid.
[84.55s -> 87.27s]  All right, can we go into like an actual server now and no more- like
[91.34s -> 93.58s]  No, get out of here with that stupid move.
[97.42s -> 99.42s]  Do it
[105.24s -> 110.28s]  Oh, yeah, hey mace Windu is in this game. You better be careful. I think these are bots.
[111.72s -> 120.34s]  Probably. Who's playing this game? Emperor Palpatine, Bidu, Lieutenant Cable, Leia, Mace Windu. Yeah, these are fucking bots.
[120.90s -> 124.02s]  Okay. All right. Well, you ready to get your ass kicked by bots?
[124.58s -> 127.78s]  We're- yeah, we're the only people who readied up just there. Yeah. What?
[128.82s -> 129.86s]  What?
[129.86s -> 133.38s]  Why did this just turn into a first-person shooter? Because you have a gun now.
[135.61s -> 138.65s]  You don't start with a lightsaber. Why is it an FPS?
[139.77s -> 146.01s]  Who am I supposed to be shooting? Is it- are you guys shooting? No, we're leaving. This is- this is a bad server.
[148.15s -> 150.71s]  Is this me and you just like standing at the side watching this?
[151.27s -> 154.95s]  Can I get this thing off my screen? This like message for the day?
[155.91s -> 158.15s]  I wanna-
[158.39s -> 160.39s]  This is stupid.
[167.24s -> 169.24s]  Who's this lady in like the pajamas?
[171.18s -> 176.22s]  Is that like Princess Leia? Well, I don't remember playing Princess Leia wearing like a nightie.
[179.26s -> 181.66s]  How does this guy have negative one?
[183.74s -> 186.70s]  This is so stupid. This isn't how the game is supposed to work.
[187.66s -> 191.58s]  Oh.
[191.58s -> 193.66s]  It just spawned us all in this courtyard.
[193.66s -> 197.58s]  There are legitimate game modes where you can have like guns and fight people with lightsabers.
[197.90s -> 201.66s]  No, screw that. I want to play like the pajama pillow fight mode like this.
[205.83s -> 210.71s]  I'm fairly certain. This is not what a Jedi master fight looks like.
[211.91s -> 217.51s]  I don't think this is what it looks like when people become Jedi's and fight each other.
[218.71s -> 220.71s]  I don't.
[223.34s -> 225.34s]  What else can you say?
[225.42s -> 227.42s]  This is real, real dumb.
[232.31s -> 235.59s]  Are you just like standing back watching? Yeah, I don't even like want to get in there.
[236.31s -> 240.15s]  This guy with the green saber is freaking the fuck out.
[246.71s -> 252.47s]  I'm wondering why this isn't a one-shot kill. I thought maybe the shift was necessary. I'm curious if I can just walk through here.
[253.03s -> 268.07s]  This guy's like freaking. This guy wants to kill us so bad, but he can't kill us.
[283.02s -> 288.54s]  This is not right. This just shouldn't be a thing. All right, can somebody please win?
[293.42s -> 295.42s]  Ew.
[295.50s -> 298.46s]  Oh, you're gross. All right, well you want to get this guy?
[299.66s -> 302.58s]  Watch out for this guy.
[302.58s -> 304.54s]  Did you just see?
[304.54s -> 306.92s]  I don't.
[307.00s -> 309.00s]  What even just happened?
[309.64s -> 314.04s]  I've got pushed off somehow. So did I. We both got like thrown off.
[315.08s -> 316.68s]  I'm surprised
[316.68s -> 319.34s]  and appalled.
[319.34s -> 323.90s]  I gotta end it on the backstab technique. That's I have to end this video on the backstab technique. Have to.
[325.70s -> 327.70s]  You taught it to me. It has to be done.
[328.42s -> 336.20s]  Come on. I have to end the video on the backstab.
[339.64s -> 341.64s]  This guy's trying to do it too.
[346.68s -> 348.68s]  I just don't.
[350.52s -> 352.52s]  That's not happening.
[358.22s -> 360.22s]  Remember all that training we did guys?
[361.18s -> 365.10s]  Let's just freak the fuck out and swing around in circles at each other.
[366.62s -> 369.44s]  Jedis, we're Jedi masters.
