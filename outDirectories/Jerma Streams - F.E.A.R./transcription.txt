[1.27s -> 12.50s]  Hello, how you guys doing? Welcome back to the stream. The stream is currently bopping. I mean,
[13.06s -> 21.61s]  it's on. I wouldn't necessarily say the stream is bopping right now because, I mean, it's not
[21.61s -> 24.97s]  there's not, it's not like anything crazy is happening right now or anything cool.
[26.09s -> 31.62s]  I mean, I guess the planets are cool. Nobody dancing though. Well, I mean, the jay is kind
[31.62s -> 40.74s]  of dancing. That's me. It's bopping. I retract my statement. When I say nothing, I mean nothing like
[40.74s -> 47.86s]  cool on that. This is the starting card and it is cool, but I'm talking about like nothing's
[47.86s -> 56.95s]  nothing cool happened yet on camera and the pre-stream voice. That's yeah, that's it.
[58.76s -> 63.08s]  Moving on to the real thing now. No, hope you're doing well. Before we get going, I want to talk
[63.08s -> 67.56s]  about a couple of things because they're very important and it is going to affect the streams
[68.28s -> 75.82s]  and I want to keep you guys in the loop of things because you know, that's that's what we do here.
[77.13s -> 84.09s]  So I am currently on a couple of new medications for my stomach
[85.37s -> 93.02s]  and one of them is kind of hard to manage. We'll just put it that way.
[95.82s -> 105.38s]  So the streams over the next week, there are going to be more streams, but they are going
[105.38s -> 110.58s]  to be shorter. So instead of streaming a few times for six, seven, eight hours,
[111.78s -> 118.06s]  I'm going to stream more than a few times, like probably four or five times in a row here,
[119.24s -> 127.58s]  but only for like three or four hours at a time. So more days, less time because the medication
[127.58s -> 138.02s]  that I'm on is kind of makes it hard to sit here for more than a few hours at a time. It's sort of
[138.02s -> 146.70s]  difficult to do. So I figured that's probably a good way to do this. We actually like that. Well,
[146.70s -> 151.02s]  it's just for this week because I do like to stream for at least six hours or so.
[152.65s -> 156.97s]  And we're going to start with fear. We'll not start with, I mean, we did horror stuff last week. So
[157.77s -> 164.33s]  what you can expect over the next week, the original fear is what's going to happen now
[165.42s -> 169.58s]  and then into tomorrow and the next day or whatever, you know, how we do this,
[170.38s -> 175.42s]  how long it takes to beat fear. I am not going to move on to fear two and I'm not going to move
[175.42s -> 183.74s]  on to fear three, at least not now. I've been told that fear two and fear three are not very good.
[184.54s -> 193.66s]  I've heard that fear one is great, but then the other two are really not even close. I'm not saying
[193.66s -> 203.08s]  I will not play them on stream. They're just not a priority. I also have the thing on PC. If you
[203.08s -> 211.53s]  don't know the thing, it's supposed to be the sequel to the movie, I guess. It looks like it's
[211.53s -> 218.71s]  going to be crazy. I've never played the thing. I've heard it's wild. There's also a couple of
[218.71s -> 226.58s]  PlayStation two horror games that I have, which we will try and mess around with. And then there's
[226.58s -> 233.38s]  a bunch of rhythm games and then it's Halloween. So that's kind of what you're looking at for the
[233.38s -> 243.00s]  next couple of weeks. But without further ado, let's get started because I don't want to sit
[243.00s -> 251.64s]  here for more than a few minutes because I'm kind of up against the clock. I will not go into the
[251.64s -> 259.80s]  gritty details on this, but we got to go. You know what I mean? We've got to start. So here we go.
[260.60s -> 271.21s]  I think there's a camera on. It's not. Why is the camera not on? Well, you can see that.
[274.34s -> 280.38s]  What the F? What the F? I really don't want to start saying F words. Like,
[280.38s -> 288.74s]  fuck. Did you guys know? I didn't even know this. I didn't know that you could say the F word on TV.
[289.46s -> 296.46s]  Did you guys know that? I thought I thought it was just shit. And, uh, and I didn't think you could
[296.46s -> 305.66s]  say that for it on TV. You could do it once once over a whole season or just once in an episode.
[306.22s -> 317.54s]  Do you have to pick the one place you get to use it once per episode? When are they going to get
[317.54s -> 328.54s]  rid of that? I'm just thinking about this right now. Like shit, dick, fuck, asshole. Who cares?
[332.66s -> 341.11s]  You're like seven-year-old kids and not watching The Sopranos. So why? The demographic for these
[341.11s -> 355.21s]  TV shows are for adults. We just pretend that adults don't say swears. I don't get it. The rule
[355.85s -> 362.09s]  is with the boomers. Yeah, but what about what your kids might hear? Okay, so if I have a DVD
[362.09s -> 367.21s]  player and I put an R rated movie in my DVD player and I press play and I watch it really loud in my
[367.21s -> 374.38s]  man cave, they're going to hear that too. What's the difference? It's like it's my house. I decide
[374.38s -> 382.02s]  the swears that come through my speakers. You know what I mean? Like, sure. Like, oh, this is
[382.10s -> 386.10s]  mature content in it, right? That people do that. Why can't I determine the kind of square words
[386.10s -> 397.11s]  that I have in my house? I'm just realizing this right now. That's fucking weird. Don't say shit on
[397.11s -> 406.23s]  TV. What? Why? Oh, fucking the world. You know what I mean? I'm supposed to go. Dude, my mom is
[406.23s -> 417.86s]  watching. Your mom probably says the word fuck a hundred times a day. You're just not in the room.
[418.10s -> 425.67s]  You're at school. Your mother like probably like stubs her toe and it's just like, fuck,
[426.23s -> 441.24s]  fuck, fuck. And then you walk in there like, honey, how was school today? I know this because I
[441.24s -> 450.63s]  caught my mother swearing. She was like making up. She was doing like a, she was making something
[450.63s -> 454.31s]  like a, she was baking something. And I just heard, she didn't know I was in the room.
[455.03s -> 459.91s]  This is when I was like, I don't know, I was like 17, 18. And I just hear like, she didn't know I
[459.91s -> 464.15s]  came in and I just hear like this fucking recipe is so fucking stupid. What the fuck is with this
[464.15s -> 472.23s]  fucking fucking recipe is fucking stupid. And I was like, Holy shit. Wow. And then she turned,
[472.23s -> 481.05s]  it was like, Oh, and she was like, sometimes when people get at, I gotta go. All right. What am I?
[482.17s -> 493.70s]  Low difficulty, not low, but made fun of. Not extreme. No. This guy, this guy, this game is
[493.78s -> 499.70s]  like 15 years old. Extreme difficulty means it's impossible to beat. You die in like one bullet.
[499.70s -> 507.38s]  I'm not doing that. I'm not doing extreme. No, we're going to do moderate. We're going to do,
[507.38s -> 511.54s]  we're going to do somewhere high increase enemy action. We're going to do weapons image
[512.18s -> 516.97s]  recommended for veteran players looking for a challenge. Moderate default enemy actually
[516.97s -> 524.63s]  weapon damage recommended for experienced players. Novice and casual. I ain't one of those. I'm an
[524.63s -> 531.75s]  experienced player. It's too late. There's no confirmation. I'm an experienced player.
[534.71s -> 538.79s]  I would do high. Well, we can change it on the fly. I think. Okay. Situational high level alert
[538.79s -> 543.59s]  has been issued. Mission fear teams to report for emergency briefing on the situation. You've
[543.59s -> 547.51s]  just been transferred to the unit as a point man. This will be your first assignment with fear.
[549.66s -> 557.70s]  He's going with two today. In 2002, the U S army formed a secret unit dedicated to
[557.70s -> 565.46s]  combating paranormal threats to national security. The unit was named first encounter assault recon.
[568.84s -> 574.12s]  Oh, for short, an iPad strategy game that just came out on the app store last week.
[575.08s -> 581.40s]  Sierra entertainment. That's an old one. Ma Monolith made this. That's right.
[582.12s -> 595.58s]  This is way too low. I can't even hear this. Hopefully you can. Nope. Oh, they're the ones
[595.58s -> 607.90s]  that made shadow of war, by the way. It's a great studio. That is so small. It's an eye exam.
[608.70s -> 624.41s]  Hope you guys like the subtitles. Pretty good movies. Sound clip too. We're going to be
[624.41s -> 640.76s]  criticizing this whole time. I hope you understand. Grant good Eve grant. Wait, the TF2 engineer is in
[640.76s -> 646.70s]  this game already plus five letter grades. Who's the, who's the, who's grant good Eve?
[646.70s -> 664.54s]  What the fuck did I do that for? What's that guy? Is he going to do it to you?
[665.58s -> 679.78s]  Oh, that's, that's the ATC of alcohol, tobacco and cheaters. Like it's cheating in video games,
[679.78s -> 701.48s]  the ATC. I know that one. I have to like not laugh today. Currently got a lot going on down here.
[716.68s -> 726.36s]  We can still resolve this discreetly, but we have to move. I don't think so. We got to find,
[726.36s -> 734.89s]  we got to find grant good Eve. This wacko's name is Paxton Fettle. He's the key. If we contain him,
[734.89s -> 740.49s]  we contain the situation. Fucker's got an appetite. I think he has an agenda. It's not just
[740.89s -> 746.09s]  you got to turn on VSync. Essential vitamins and nutrients. It's not looking good. What's his story?
[746.81s -> 751.61s]  Property of Armicam technology corporation. They're working on a military contract to develop
[751.61s -> 757.05s]  an army of clones that respond to a psychic commander. Top secret, of course. Fettle is one
[757.05s -> 761.69s]  of the commanders. You gotta be fucking kidding me. This is why nobody takes us seriously.
[763.45s -> 769.05s]  A full battalion of them, highly trained, heavily armed, full battalion. What are we supposed to do
[769.05s -> 773.61s]  against a thousand super soldiers? Like I said, we put Fettle down and it's over.
[773.61s -> 777.29s]  Fortunately, the whole point of the program is to give commanders firsthand knowledge of the
[777.29s -> 782.01s]  battlefield. That's not Boston. What are you talking about? Knowledge of the commander without
[782.01s -> 787.05s]  having to wade through all those soldiers. That's like Wisconsin, Boston. Planted a transmitter in
[787.05s -> 791.61s]  his head. Should lead us right to him. That's awfully convenient. Assuming it does what it's
[791.61s -> 796.49s]  supposed to. What about you buddy? Ready to go to work? You're putting him in the field?
[797.45s -> 805.21s]  Are you crazy? He just transferred in a week ago. Of course. His reflexes are totally off the charts.
[805.21s -> 809.69s]  I think he can handle himself. Whatever man, it's your call. Goddamn right it is.
[810.97s -> 814.73s]  Why do I feel like that's the kind of hat like a guy at the gym is going to have on?
[835.75s -> 844.66s]  Okay, car plus one letter grade. No sign of enemy activity on the satellite, but don't take any
[844.74s -> 849.22s]  chances. Jenkowski, you in position? Just say the word. All right, move it out.
[850.87s -> 857.19s]  Situation. F.E.A.R. mission coordinator Rowdy Betters has tracked enemy commander Paxton Fettle
[857.19s -> 863.75s]  to an abandoned building in Auburn District. Hannibal III spy satellite in Geo Synchronous
[863.75s -> 869.46s]  orbit shows no signs of replica soldiers in vicinity. F.E.A.R. combat operatives will
[869.46s -> 874.90s]  infiltrate target site from two separate entry points and attempt to neutralize Fettle. According
[874.90s -> 881.38s]  to Armachem, technical advisor, once Fettle is contained, replica soldiers will become inactive
[881.38s -> 886.90s]  and can be rounded up without incident. Investigate area for signs of Paxton Fettle. I could have just
[886.90s -> 904.89s]  read that part. Let's turn the volume up a little. Let's make it a little louder. I came in here
[904.89s -> 911.05s]  earlier. I'm trying to make it like a nice level for you guys. I don't want you to have your ears
[911.05s -> 924.22s]  hurt. And yes, I did get the I got the 90 FOV changer. So this should be at a good FOV. All
[924.22s -> 929.34s]  right. Do I have a map? What do I got a gun? That's very loud. That's like so loud that I may have
[929.34s -> 941.21s]  just scared the shit out of a lot of you. And I'm going to change that now. That's an explosion.
[943.59s -> 948.31s]  That that to me is the hearing that and how scary that was and how fucking abrupt it was.
[949.19s -> 952.15s]  That's like, what did you put in the microwave that exploded?
[953.10s -> 956.70s]  Like how long did you leave the bag of popcorn in there for? All right, well, how do I crouch?
[961.50s -> 968.62s]  Okay, made it. C. C and then it's, I guess you could shoot it too. Do you have infinity ammo?
[971.24s -> 973.80s]  Yeah, you just sprint normally. All right, so let's go. We gotta get in here.
[974.60s -> 986.97s]  Okay, no, we go this way. Thank God I could put toggle on. I did that before we started.
[987.77s -> 992.68s]  Press use to open doors or activate objects. All right, so use.
[995.37s -> 998.97s]  Really? Okay, I thought I was just I was about to make a joke about me being on fire,
[998.97s -> 1005.61s]  but you can catch fire. Good to know. Tutorial. Wait, anything over?
[1011.50s -> 1019.29s]  Fuck. What the fuck are you doing? Wait, is it back for like vengeance?
[1029.98s -> 1039.88s]  How do I have flashlight, right? Plus V to use flashlight. I have a battery in the flashlight.
[1039.96s -> 1042.76s]  That's great. Please help us keep this room clean.
[1055.19s -> 1057.83s]  Why did you punch the glass out? Try to find a way around.
[1059.38s -> 1069.03s]  Rendezvous with Jan Kowski. All right, find a way around. Hey, bro. What a trash in here.
[1069.67s -> 1102.90s]  Come here, you little fuck. Wait, I can slide? Holy shit, he exploded. Oh, man, that was terrible.
[1102.90s -> 1107.21s]  I, okay. I just need to, it's a tutorial. I need to test, see if I can do that stuff.
[1107.93s -> 1120.14s]  Pick up a hammer. Wait. Oh, what? No, I thought it was pick up hammer. I can't use hammer. Oh,
[1124.15s -> 1127.35s]  that's a permanent health upgrade. I'm assuming it's like half life.
[1127.91s -> 1155.43s]  Come on, open for space to jump. Wait, open it. I can't. I can't open this. Touch door,
[1155.43s -> 1166.74s]  Easter egg. I can't like fit through that. I don't have an okay. The print is so small.
[1167.38s -> 1195.74s]  I cannot, I don't see. It's like I've 71 in that. What? All right. My accuracy rating.
[1199.03s -> 1203.72s]  Oh shit, I can knock him down. That's wasting ammo. Right. All right. Right. Right. All right.
[1203.72s -> 1208.01s]  Okay. I'm not going to waste ammo. Why'd you bring me here? Why'd you bring me back?
[1208.57s -> 1232.26s]  That was a delayed reaction there. All right. When were we supposed to just go around to find
[1232.26s -> 1238.95s]  that guy? Jan Kowski. Is it ammo anywhere that I should be? All right. That just,
[1238.95s -> 1244.79s]  I thought that was somebody coming to get me. Shoot the padlock. Sure thing. First try. Ready?
[1246.52s -> 1262.87s]  Shoot the padlock. Holy fuck. My God. All right. Where's Macaulay Culkin?
[1264.54s -> 1267.98s]  Hey, you would have had me. You would have killed, you would have killed me right there, Macaulay.
[1269.58s -> 1287.54s]  Didn't saw that one. Thin enough. Hold on a second. I was just, I just crashed the game.
[1287.54s -> 1297.62s]  You ready? Find a neutralized pack of Fettel. Go. And what's going on? What's, what happened to you?
[1301.62s -> 1307.50s]  Uh oh. Uh oh. I think that might have just been an Infinity Wars,
[1307.98s -> 1316.54s]  uh, an end game Marvel universe happening in the world here. If you have, it's, it's a spoiler
[1316.54s -> 1326.10s]  for Infinity. This is not even Marvel. Forget it. Jin, we need you up here. Looks like we're too
[1326.10s -> 1335.62s]  late, boss. Just leftovers. Gotta be around there somewhere. I'll wait here for Jin. You take a look
[1335.62s -> 1341.22s]  around. You guys are fucking hilarious. Infinity. No, I'm not going to make that. That's legit. Get
[1341.22s -> 1347.08s]  going. I'm talking to somebody in my earpiece right now. For all you know, I could be getting
[1347.08s -> 1359.70s]  some extremely important info. Dude, take a look around. Am I going to hit him in the face?
[1360.50s -> 1368.52s]  What are you, chicken shit or something? Look, you're the FNG. So you do as I say. What? Since
[1368.52s -> 1381.34s]  when? All right, let's go. If somebody here, we're outside. Let's turn the flashlight off.
[1382.55s -> 1392.81s]  I'm trying to prove that I can shoot in video games and they're giving me all these
[1392.81s -> 1424.81s]  fucking stupid little opportunities to show you. Give me a light gun. I would have had that. Okay.
[1424.81s -> 1436.42s]  What about up? Maybe up. That looks, can I get in the window? That would hurt so bad. No,
[1436.42s -> 1445.70s]  I want to jump and hit the window. Okay. I don't know what I knocked. I know. Well,
[1445.70s -> 1456.68s]  I can't get back up there ever again. Oh well. These things boarded out. I'm making a mountain
[1456.68s -> 1471.61s]  out of a molehill here. I killed him. I would have killed him. I got him like four times in the chest.
[1472.25s -> 1494.87s]  Makes no difference. He deserved to die. They all deserve to die. Come in. Over. What's going on?
[1495.03s -> 1502.36s]  Last pedal signal. Rejoin the team. Tom cast? What kind of situation?
[1509.10s -> 1515.56s]  Let's head back down. We'll be ready. What was the whole, what was the point of me going up here?
[1516.68s -> 1533.99s]  Just to look at the roof. By the way, I have 47 bullets left. I have shot like 30 and there has
[1533.99s -> 1540.23s]  not been a single enemy on the screen. So I might need to restart the game and just run through this.
[1541.19s -> 1549.46s]  Hey, back already? See anything? You guys about done up there? Our day's just getting started.
[1549.46s -> 1559.45s]  You boys run along. I'll be busy here for a while. Why? Because the guy's dead. Breathe.
[1559.45s -> 1573.22s]  I've tried to forget. I've tried so hard to forget.
[1583.54s -> 1589.06s]  Okay. These men are from fear. There are special attachments to our unit for the duration of this
[1589.14s -> 1594.10s]  up. They will be on point. Their mission is to assess the nature of the threat.
[1594.10s -> 1599.86s]  Our job is to keep them alive. Do not engage the enemy. Remember that we are not dealing with
[1599.86s -> 1605.86s]  ordinary bad guys. Team one will move in from the southwest. Team two will approach from the north.
[1605.86s -> 1609.38s]  Once our recon is complete, we will rendezvous and wait for further orders.
[1610.50s -> 1618.12s]  Okay. Let's saddle up. What if you're not on any, any team? Do I just stay in the helicopter?
[1619.88s -> 1627.88s]  Oh, right. Yeah. James, right. You, you go ahead and you open up your iPad and find us a good
[1627.88s -> 1652.12s]  place to eat after. Really important job. Okay. I guess. Yes, sir. Open up Google maps and just
[1652.12s -> 1656.63s]  type in food. That is actually pretty good.
[1656.63s -> 1665.50s]  Oh, yeah. This is little bird. We're on the ground. Let's go.
[1667.67s -> 1671.67s]  You're on point. See if you can get this kid open. Okay. I'd send one of my boys,
[1671.67s -> 1679.11s]  but I think we need a specialist for this one. Yeah. Stupid. Yeah. Since we got a Tweedledee
[1679.11s -> 1690.90s]  and Tweedledum over here, I think I can do, I'm going for it. Yes, sir. These two idiots. All
[1690.90s -> 1709.54s]  right. Uh, I think it might be over in here. What was it? A price scanner? Reflex booster.
[1710.42s -> 1735.91s]  Reflex is permanently boosted. Okay. Anything up here? No. Hey, I didn't, I didn't find that. I
[1735.91s -> 1765.94s]  found a reflex booster though, dude. Cool. It's not over here. You know, it'd be good if we all
[1765.94s -> 1779.27s]  looked instead of just telling me to do this. It doesn't work. Shoot the, shooting the gate doesn't
[1779.27s -> 1789.94s]  do anything. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why would anybody do that? Did I miss it over here? Maybe
[1789.94s -> 1813.08s]  it's, yeah, I can keep going. I think there we go. Okay. Can I use this? Does it explode? Yep.
[1813.72s -> 1820.17s]  They just hear, they hear that downstairs over there. They hear a fucking explosion.
[1823.13s -> 1834.09s]  Dude, you just have to press a button. What are you doing up there? Okay. Hey, I found the button.
[1834.81s -> 1869.80s]  It's up here. It's going to be, yep. Coming. They're all skeletons.
[1870.84s -> 1892.38s]  If you look at her, you die. You turn it. That's like super Medusa. Medusa just turns you to stone.
[1892.38s -> 1900.34s]  This peels all your skin and muscles off and melts you. That's kind of fucked up. Status unknown.
[1900.34s -> 1904.50s]  Both teams have gone silent and fear teams. Life signs monitors are offline. Interference
[1904.50s -> 1910.02s]  is preventing satellite reconnaissance. Surviving operatives should attempt to rendezvous in an
[1910.02s -> 1914.02s]  exfiltrate mission area until reinforcements arrive rendezvous with Jan Kowski's team.
[1914.98s -> 1944.82s]  All right. Um, that's an interesting, how do they, okay. Warning. These premises are monitored.
[1944.82s -> 1961.72s]  Trespassers will be prosecuted. I probably just got pressing a button. Yeah. Don't have to worry
[1961.72s -> 1988.25s]  about. I know what that's like. The kill command activated. Okay. Yeah. Is there any stuff in this
[1988.25s -> 1994.82s]  game? I like this game already because it's not stuff to pick up. I have problems with games with
[1994.82s -> 2025.21s]  when you have stuff to pick up these people. I thought we were not. Oh, these bad. Okay.
[2025.21s -> 2041.37s]  Okay. Wait, what? What happened? Hold on. Did I lose? Did I lose the game?
[2044.78s -> 2054.60s]  All right. Okay. For a second, I thought we, I was rendezvousing and I stood there and exploding.
[2054.60s -> 2058.38s]  There was explosion that way. All right. I get it. Let's go.
[2059.10s -> 2060.06s]  I just started.
[2063.26s -> 2100.33s]  Do it. Good. Here we go. All right. Good. Ammo. Please listen closely as our menu options have
[2100.33s -> 2106.47s]  changed. It's been like that for fucking seven years. I think people know by now.
[2106.47s -> 2138.06s]  I don't know what's in here. All right. He's dead. I should be peeking way more often than I do.
[2138.06s -> 2148.60s]  All right. Wait, hold on. Everybody up there. Health kits, health bleach. I don't know. I'm
[2148.60s -> 2173.54s]  going to go up. It seriously is fucking home alone. What's in here? Oh, med kit to use med
[2173.54s -> 2178.18s]  kit T to restore some of your health. You can carry up to 10. Okay. Well, that's good to know.
[2178.74s -> 2184.44s]  I think I've got a med kit. I want to upgrade the flashlight. I ain't going that way yet.
[2184.44s -> 2203.53s]  There's another place to go down here. Is it fall damage? Nope. Best game ever. Okay. Nothing
[2203.53s -> 2213.45s]  out here. Can I not break through this? I can't just turn sideways and slide through there.
[2214.25s -> 2233.00s]  Oh, well, I guess not. I'm too, I'm too fat apparently. Yeah. That's all good. All right.
[2233.00s -> 2246.01s]  I got everything I needed. Uh, let's keep going. T is health kit, right? Uh, I didn't really mean to
[2246.01s -> 2259.13s]  do that, but it's okay. No, don't. Oh, wait, no, I want to go that way. Okay. That's how you get it.
[2260.74s -> 2280.97s]  Why am I sliding on this? Oh, that's how you get out. Very cool. Let's go. Checkpoint. That's not it.
[2283.43s -> 2319.98s]  Mouse three is mouse three is different because I changed it. Oh, I can't, I can't laugh that hard.
[2324.71s -> 2342.23s]  Oh shit. He was smart. What happened to that guy? What was that explosion? All right. I'm good.
[2342.23s -> 2358.70s]  The gun play is actually pretty fun. All right. I got a pistol. That's a, that's a double pistol.
[2359.42s -> 2381.94s]  We've got health 95. Any, uh, potions. It's fun. That's fun to shoot.
[2389.99s -> 2407.30s]  Right in the head. All right. I gotta be careful. I need armor. I gotta take flashlight off of V by
[2407.30s -> 2411.22s]  the way. It's getting in the way. It's me. I'm hitting C accidentally because I don't know
[2411.22s -> 2435.69s]  where the CV and X are on the keyboard and I'll laugh it up. It's fine. I don't see anybody. No,
[2435.69s -> 2481.64s]  don't break it. Hello. We all right. We good. Okay. Pacific rim. He's just like tripped. Check
[2481.64s -> 2504.22s]  it out and go see what happened. All right. We're good. Do you get a shotgun in this game?
[2504.78s -> 2523.61s]  Cause damn, that would be fun. Yep. Oh, good. Good. Good. Good. Fizzy Cola. Dice. Dicked. Squish.
[2523.61s -> 2533.34s]  I feel like the, the, that's like what you guys write in donation messages.
[2535.58s -> 2550.17s]  What? Oh, that's a grenade. How long did you hold that for? The timing on that was incredible.
[2551.62s -> 2596.28s]  What is mouse for? I have to heal. They have these insane grenades. I have them too, but
[2596.28s -> 2604.90s]  they blow up really fast. They are cooking these things for a full seven or eight seconds. Use the
[2604.90s -> 2617.75s]  slow mo. Oh, the camera's in a bad spot. Hold on. On the next save point. I'll move it. The game
[2617.75s -> 2636.60s]  hasn't, the game hasn't taught me to use the slow mo yet though. What's that? So I need to be true
[2636.60s -> 2661.86s]  to the video game. I can, I don't want to break that though. Oh, fuck. That's like super slow mo
[2661.86s -> 2667.78s]  videos. That guy's head rocked in a circle like five. That's how, you know, I hit him really hard.
[2668.58s -> 2671.64s]  That's like when you punch somebody in the face, like slow motion, it's like,
[2673.48s -> 2679.56s]  your face like turns to fucking yellow and you can see their eyes and skull pulsate and rock back
[2679.56s -> 2693.32s]  and forth. That's so bad. Okay. That's a good strategy though is slow mo punching face.
[2694.12s -> 2709.35s]  Anybody else in here? Oh shit. Pick up. What is that? It's an assault rifle
[2711.03s -> 2717.70s]  and another pistol. How loud is this? It's actually pretty quiet. It's like underwater.
[2717.70s -> 2727.21s]  Cool. All right. I'm not going to use it yet. We'll stick with the default. Is this a new pistol
[2727.21s -> 2739.99s]  or is this just two of these? Tri-wheeled. Hold the other one in your mouth, just like with your
[2739.99s -> 2755.43s]  teeth. They hit you with like feet. Pop on one foot and like, that'd be so funny. Why hasn't a
[2755.43s -> 2760.33s]  video game done that? Like laugh out loud kind of humor. You got three pistols. Oh, here comes like
[2760.33s -> 2765.37s]  a foot on camera up there. What a fucking hilarious moment that would be for all these streamers and
[2765.37s -> 2771.08s]  YouTubers. If you could see, if you could see, what did it say? If you can see the blinking,
[2771.08s -> 2794.47s]  it means what? That it can be activated. Okay. Loud noises. Anything else? What if he's like
[2794.47s -> 2805.90s]  blocking something? Nope. You know, there could be something under there. Like it could be any
[2805.90s -> 2810.90s]  situation where, oh, there's a grenade under there because you did that. All right. Let's go.
[2812.02s -> 2821.21s]  I, it's, I can't do this. It's a puzzle. I don't, I didn't think this was a puzzle game. I don't
[2821.21s -> 2850.34s]  want to do it anymore. I think I'm done. What? That's so much better than me. That projectiles.
[2856.90s -> 2883.80s]  Oh fuck. Okay. Don't fuck it up again. God damn it. This is far. Okay. Med kid. I didn't,
[2883.80s -> 2902.49s]  they all just kind of spawned and came at me. Are you, why is it on pulse fire now?
[2905.93s -> 2925.88s]  They were not this many before. Did it add enemies? All right. Let's go. Fuck. Okay. Is there,
[2926.52s -> 2939.69s]  oh, there is a save. Okay. I didn't know. Is it, was it F5? Quick saving. All right. Well,
[2939.69s -> 2984.07s]  now, well now I know. Whoa. See ya. All right. Where are those grenades? Quick save.
[2984.63s -> 2994.78s]  There's grenades in here. I know there is. Okay. Got that. Where are the grenades?
[3002.39s -> 3011.50s]  Come on. That can go off. There's nothing behind there or anything. Really? Okay. Fine. Whatever.
[3012.14s -> 3023.61s]  All right. Got that. There's no grenade. There they are. That's kind of cool. I'm going to do
[3023.61s -> 3038.12s]  that to somebody in slow mo. Quick save. Here we are. I made it. Wait, wait, that's got armor too.
[3038.76s -> 3043.24s]  They drop armor. That's, that's pretty sick. All right. All right. Here we go.
[3055.06s -> 3061.46s]  That guy, that guy like threw it like this. Why did he go like this? Usually you throw, you go,
[3061.46s -> 3069.27s]  all right, man, let's like throw it. No, he went like this. Here we go. Like he said, oh, I'm going
[3069.27s -> 3086.65s]  to windmill. He threw it right into the ground. He reversed softball pitch that good back upstairs.
[3086.65s -> 3098.01s]  Here we go. So he baseball pitched it. No, no, no, you don't pitch like that in baseball.
[3099.06s -> 3104.98s]  Nobody does. Nobody goes spin, spin up here and let's go up here. Nobody does that.
[3107.18s -> 3114.92s]  You do that under and you let go for softball. You don't do that in baseball. I know this.
[3115.80s -> 3145.37s]  I can't climb through that. All right. Let's jump kick. Wait, I think I got him.
[3146.01s -> 3158.62s]  I think I did it. Did he say, oh, slow mo. He didn't say that. Right. Am I just injecting that in?
[3160.92s -> 3169.59s]  Ah, why did my motherboard come out of the fucking monitor? What? Oh, he was so psyched.
[3170.63s -> 3185.13s]  Oh, shit, no way, dude. Slow mo. That's so cool. Okay. Here we go. Listen to the message.
[3185.77s -> 3201.02s]  This is it. They come out of the door. Get it ready. Ready? Hold on. Check this out.
[3201.82s -> 3207.82s]  They come through that door, right? Watch this. This is gonna be cool. It's gonna be cool. I think.
[3225.26s -> 3227.74s]  That was pretty cool. I mean, it was pretty cool.
[3236.38s -> 3244.71s]  Hey, dude. Look at it. When did this game come out? This actually is pretty good. This is like
[3244.71s -> 3254.23s]  pretty advanced shit for a game that had a future being 2002. When did this game come out? Like 1999?
[3254.23s -> 3258.15s]  The year is 2002. Like that's supposed to be the future, right? When does it come out?
[3263.50s -> 3267.66s]  2005. Okay. Yeah. I mean, that's still, that's more than 10 plus years ago. All right. Hold on.
[3267.66s -> 3301.06s]  Did I miss anything? It said 2005. Well, sorry. It's in six point font. Gun, armor. Nice. I'm here.
[3321.37s -> 3333.86s]  Did he say Pog? I'm telling you, you guys have ruined me. Grenade of Pog. Okay. Let's keep going.
[3333.86s -> 3338.66s]  Did I miss anything? I want to make sure I don't miss anything. No, it's just some boxes.
[3344.23s -> 3354.25s]  Rifle, rifle, rifle, rifle. Yeah. That guy's got a rifle. I'll get it. What?
[3355.88s -> 3362.92s]  It's got a shot in the head. Oh, a bullet in the head. What the fuck was that? Did a fly just fly
[3362.92s -> 3393.46s]  into my visor? What is it? Damn it. How many healed? All right. Assault rifle. Upgrades.
[3394.02s -> 3401.21s]  Games with upgrades. I love them. When does the game get scary? It kind of already has been,
[3401.21s -> 3411.38s]  don't you think? There's been like a few weird, scary. I mean, this, this is doing the scary
[3411.38s -> 3420.46s]  little girl thing back when that was in the height of its scariness. That looks like an exit.
[3420.46s -> 3430.39s]  I want to get this stuff. Nothing else. And telephone that's not off the hook.
[3431.03s -> 3445.75s]  And then, but they still, they're still doing the scary little girl thing. They just turned it into
[3445.75s -> 3462.02s]  a doll. It's evolved. Your height and reflexes will give you an edge against enemies. Press
[3462.02s -> 3465.54s]  slow mo to enter slow motion. See, I told you, they didn't give me a tutorial for it yet. And
[3465.54s -> 3511.64s]  you guys are trying to get me to do it. I didn't know what happens. Oh, the recoil. All right.
[3511.64s -> 3528.30s]  Let's end this guy with a kick. Damn it. Where the hell are you? Where's this guy? Did he die?
[3530.23s -> 3545.53s]  No, there's somebody still over here. No, he's dead. Good. Checkpoint. Save. Let's keep going.
[3548.86s -> 3568.34s]  Do a side kick. Ooh, what's that? Same thing I had? Yeah. Crouch and melee. A slide kick.
[3568.90s -> 3597.19s]  Do I have to be running for a certain amount? All right. Free slow mo. I could use it. Fucking
[3597.19s -> 3604.90s]  idiot. I just had to do it. It's like my attention problems. I thought I was far enough away.
[3605.46s -> 3627.61s]  Let's keep going. All right. Hold on. Um, doesn't look like you have anything.
[3630.57s -> 3636.76s]  No, dude, turn your own stream off. What are you fucking an amateur?
[3637.72s -> 3657.98s]  They don't have any stuff. This looks safe. I would highly doubt that, but you know, it's all good.
[3661.61s -> 3676.68s]  So slide kick, huh? Do I have to hold crouch? How do you do a slide? Double tap. We've got to be
[3676.68s -> 3699.34s]  sprinting first. Am I not sprinting already? Oh, I probably should run. I thought it was a cut scene.
[3700.86s -> 3705.34s]  I thought it was, okay, I thought it was a, I thought it was like a thing that we were watching.
[3706.46s -> 3716.46s]  It was playing music. It was like, I thought it was one of these kind of scenarios.
[3716.46s -> 3729.98s]  Someone, someone, there is nothing here. Just get to the turnaround and didn't do it first
[3729.98s -> 3748.73s]  try. That means we don't do it at all. All right. Part two, quick save often. You're supposed to die
[3748.73s -> 3753.77s]  there. So then the game can tell you, Hey, I mean, just want to let you know, you probably should
[3753.77s -> 3758.09s]  save all the time. You see, I wouldn't have done that unless you guys told me to. So you know what
[3758.09s -> 3779.94s]  I'm saying? Okay, here we go. Did I make it? I was trying to go through the door, but I got,
[3780.66s -> 3799.75s]  I jumped out. Okay. Cool. He's alive. He doesn't appear to be injured, although I don't know how
[3799.75s -> 3801.75s]  we survive. Injury level three escalation.
[3811.19s -> 3813.19s]  You can't send him in alone. That's crazy.
[3816.73s -> 3822.66s]  When we're just, I was just in there doing the go, I could go back in. All right. I'm going back in.
[3824.57s -> 3830.92s]  Can we trade your standing out here? You better get going. You're not in any immediate danger.
[3830.92s -> 3835.64s]  You're sending me in to go kill this guy. I want the better gun. You don't have to give me your
[3835.64s -> 3845.32s]  helmet too. It's the same gun. No, it's not. His is bigger. Let's compare guns. Well, whatever. I
[3845.32s -> 3858.50s]  want your ammo. Just take your clip out. Wait, what about, where does it want me to go? What was
[3858.50s -> 3880.18s]  that? Oh, okay. Dead guy. Okay. No, this is our choice. Not our choice. This is our chance.
[3881.62s -> 3919.27s]  What's this? Fuck. That's such a, I want that so bad. Bad guys. Now I see three tubes. That's an
[3919.27s -> 3929.03s]  explosion. Wouldn't happen, right? Or are they punching bags? Okay. Don't fuck around there.
[3936.46s -> 3944.86s]  One shot. Come on. Why am I getting flashbacks of a different game? What game did this happen in?
[3945.42s -> 3957.67s]  This happened in a game, right? I'm not insane. Am I? I remember being like on that exact bridge.
[3958.31s -> 3976.92s]  All right. Listen to the message. This turn on. Did I turn the alarm on? No. All right. This
[3976.92s -> 3986.49s]  changes this to go this way. Wait, what about down here? Any guns or weapons or hidden secrets or
[3986.49s -> 4002.84s]  something? Probably not, but I'm just going to do it. It doesn't look like it. Nope. Wear the shot.
[4004.50s -> 4013.74s]  Why not just build two bridges? Yeah. It seems very, very stupid. Why do you need an entire
[4013.74s -> 4019.86s]  electronic mechanism to spin this around when you could just have it cross in the middle? Slide
[4019.86s -> 4035.38s]  kick. How do you? All right. Let me get the slide kick down. Let's walk. I am running. I missed an
[4035.38s -> 4045.29s]  upgrade. What? Back to the boxes. Check the controls. All right. So controls. Configure
[4045.29s -> 4055.74s]  controls. Toggle walk. Movement. Step right, turn, lift side, walk, jump, crouch. Toggle walk.
[4061.16s -> 4068.17s]  Interaction. Flashlight, slow-mo, aim, reload, throw grenade. Look down, center view, inventory.
[4069.13s -> 4072.34s]  Fear one doesn't have a sprint. Yeah. So how do you do the slide kick?
[4073.30s -> 4083.18s]  All right. Let me step back to the boxes because I missed something. Did I? It's forward crouch
[4083.18s -> 4097.99s]  melee. Holy shit. Oh, nice. Reflex is permanently boosted. So you got to go like that. Okay. Can
[4097.99s -> 4112.23s]  you do it in the air? Sort of. Ow. That's a broken ankle. All right. So I moved to the thing, right?
[4112.79s -> 4120.71s]  We're going to go this way. Save it. All right. Turn the flashlight off. We don't need it right
[4120.71s -> 4136.92s]  now. Okay. Down into the sewer. I don't think fall damage exists. It does not. It's been confirmed.
[4136.92s -> 4156.18s]  You can jump anywhere you want. Literally anywhere. God. Okay. Narrow tunnels. Great.
[4156.90s -> 4167.59s]  I don't have any grenades. Otherwise I just would have thrown one down this hole.
[4168.31s -> 4201.43s]  Fresh blood on the ceiling. Ooh. Health booster. What? What? What? Why is my heart beating? 110.
[4201.43s -> 4227.46s]  Nice. All right. Um, caution. I thought that was a person. I go in this building. No admittance. Oh,
[4227.46s -> 4249.43s]  well. Peak. All right. There's health over there. There's a guy right there. Okay. Here it comes.
[4249.43s -> 4268.95s]  Okay. Slide. Ready? Here it comes. Did you hear that? Oh, what happened out here? Oh, Frank was
[4268.95s -> 4277.53s]  practicing back flips again. This time that's, he ain't going to be practicing anymore. Imagine
[4278.41s -> 4283.45s]  exploding because you did try to do a back flip and you grazed your head on the ground.
[4296.87s -> 4304.26s]  Holy shit. Holy shit. I wonder what that looks like. You know, we always get to see from the
[4304.26s -> 4308.58s]  perspective of the person playing the game, what slow motion looks like, but we never get to see
[4308.58s -> 4313.56s]  what it looks like on the other side. I want to see what that looks like on the other side.
[4314.52s -> 4334.62s]  Are you just really fast? You're just super fast. Okay. Ooh. Grenade. What's that? Nothing.
[4335.26s -> 4342.23s]  That's not what that sounds like. Okay. Let's keep going. What about the lockers?
[4342.95s -> 4355.82s]  When am I going to move my camera? That's, I know. All right. I'll do it right now. Where should I
[4355.82s -> 4375.85s]  put it? Is there a good place for this to go? Top right? That's okay. All right. That's better.
[4376.49s -> 4381.11s]  I'm not going to put it in the center of the screen. There you go. Now you can see
[4382.30s -> 4389.70s]  there. Put it right in the middle. I'm not going to put it right in the middle.
[4390.58s -> 4398.87s]  No. You know how many times I've done that? Doing that. Put webcam in middle, make it three times
[4398.87s -> 4412.79s]  bigger. All right. Let's slide. Uh, another person. How would you know I was coming?
[4413.43s -> 4417.94s]  We're going to slide tackle the first person that comes down the hall. One, two,
[4417.94s -> 4457.86s]  two, three. Shit. Who's left? Ooh. New gun. Slide tackle this guy. Where is he? Isn't he right
[4457.86s -> 4482.31s]  there? Oh, no, they're dead. Okay. But is this a new gun? Stuff. Is it stuff? Why is there a
[4482.31s -> 4498.46s]  ladder here? Oh, all right. I just, this is just the way to go. Oh, come on. Really free stuff,
[4498.46s -> 4506.63s]  secret stuff. No, I didn't get, no, there's nothing there. Go get it. There's something there.
[4521.30s -> 4556.79s]  I'm just not trying to make as much noise as possible. How many? One, two. Wait, why am I
[4556.79s -> 4599.35s]  going so slow? Oh, got him. No, that hurts more than a bullet. Turn the light off. I don't have
[4599.35s -> 4608.20s]  any more grenades left. Bad. Should I switch to the other gun? No. What's the point of switching
[4608.20s -> 4621.53s]  to another gun when you have the good one? Slow down. Is there anybody to jump kick? I want to
[4621.53s -> 4632.81s]  jump kick somebody through a window. Is that possible? Nothing in any of this shit. Come on.
[4632.81s -> 4647.45s]  Really? Am I blind? No. One of these times, one of these days, someone's going to just be standing
[4647.45s -> 4654.81s]  around the corner and it's going to be awesome. Well, um, here comes a boss fight or something.
[4654.81s -> 4670.78s]  Why would this all be here? Is there, are there bosses in this game? Yeah, this is a boss. Look
[4670.78s -> 4699.80s]  at this boss room. What? Oh shit. I froze up there. Holy shit. He got in. I can't see. Okay,
[4699.80s -> 4739.10s]  done. That's another person. There's one more. Where is he? Is he dead? He's dead. Okay. Healing.
[4739.10s -> 4754.04s]  Good. Anything else? Grenades. Copy machine. I did it. I did it. I did the thing. Guaranteed
[4754.04s -> 4773.45s]  fucking comedy points. I did it. I'm going to go up and around. Got it. Okay. Keep going. Save it.
[4773.45s -> 4784.33s]  I love quick save. Seriously. It's so useful in every video game. Well, that's convenient.
[4784.97s -> 4793.64s]  I wonder what I'm supposed to do with these. Can I pick them up? I can't. But wait a minute,
[4793.64s -> 4803.67s]  we got assault rifle, more of this. First aid, seven health packs. Should I? Okay. Should I
[4803.67s -> 4808.55s]  restart? Cause I, how much health do I have? I just took, no, I'm good. I didn't mean to do that.
[4808.55s -> 4819.98s]  That's fine. All right. I'm ready. Certain laptops contain useful information. Activate the laptop
[4819.98s -> 4843.06s]  to retrieve data stored on it. Why are there green tanks on the ground? If someone's not going to
[4843.06s -> 4864.34s]  like scream and sprint down this hall. Okay. Good to know. Why are there green tanks on the wall?
[4864.90s -> 4875.08s]  I'm not on the wall. Only, you know what I mean? And there's this shit. Okay.
[4876.44s -> 4903.75s]  Look at all this prep. 80 armor. How's that? Save it. This is the door. Can I move this out of the
[4903.75s -> 4917.45s]  way and make like a shortcut? All right. Here we go. Whatever it is, it is. Turn up the difficulty.
[4919.26s -> 4933.26s]  No, no. Absolute zero. No. I have to like, we'll see after like another four hours. I can't,
[4933.26s -> 4941.53s]  I can't even turn the, look at it. Where can I do that? Game. Yeah. I know it. difficult HUD.
[4941.53s -> 4978.30s]  Okay. I'll put the difficulty to the HUD up at harder. Where's the grenade? Nice. What should,
[4978.30s -> 4997.05s]  what should I do? No, this is, this is like playing the division. Now everybody has like 5,000 HP.
[4997.05s -> 5029.94s]  It's like I can throw a grenade in here. No, don't you gonna get a shotgun? Too bad. Where's all
[5029.94s -> 5034.38s]  their ammo? I think I have full ammo in this gun. Let's use it for a little while. This thing's
[5034.38s -> 5056.26s]  pretty sick. So save it. I can't, what the fuck was that? Now get me in here. Grenade. Nope. Just
[5056.26s -> 5063.94s]  a can of soda. They so badly want me to be ready. I have eight health packs. Is that what it is?
[5063.94s -> 5068.50s]  Is that why the difficulty had to be increased? Cause I have eight health packs and I'm only
[5068.50s -> 5072.98s]  supposed to have two or something. And oh yeah, you're so lucky. You can heal whenever you want.
[5072.98s -> 5077.22s]  Right. That's what it is. And yeah, I knew it. I knew it. I'm playing the game very, very, very
[5077.22s -> 5080.66s]  well. And all of a sudden it's like, you don't, you're playing too well. You have too many health
[5080.66s -> 5095.35s]  packs. Turn it up. Fine. How do I turn damage numbers on? Cause I might as well use that too.
[5109.85s -> 5121.38s]  Alligator or something. Let's give something in the water. In my opinion, this is just me,
[5121.38s -> 5126.12s]  but in my opinion, if there's like somebody waiting for you or stalking you here, there's like the
[5126.12s -> 5130.52s]  enemies. This is what I would do in this scenario for real. Instead of where the fuck are they?
[5130.52s -> 5135.54s]  Can they see me? I would just start fucking screaming and firing. And then they'd be like,
[5135.54s -> 5144.98s]  they'd be like, what the fuck? Wait, is he in here? See it worked. See that fucked him up
[5144.98s -> 5149.14s]  because they thought they were with it. When we go in the water and we sneak around and we say,
[5149.14s -> 5167.19s]  we'll be careful. No, that ain't me. Hey, when he gets to 10 health packs, we should put it on
[5167.19s -> 5174.54s]  extreme difficulty. That is never going to happen. If you want to see a blind play through of extreme
[5174.54s -> 5198.82s]  difficulty, you are watching the wrong video game live stream. All right, we're in.
[5213.21s -> 5228.52s]  Cool. Did I die? No, I thought that was, all right, good. It's just blood. Hey! That was,
[5228.52s -> 5235.18s]  all right, that was kind of scary. It was. That was a little scary. Just a little.
[5248.54s -> 5251.10s]  Wait, you think you're having a better journey than me? Think I'm having a cool, oh, I found
[5251.10s -> 5256.54s]  some. Oh yeah. Well, I found a, I know I found human remains too. And a fucking monster in the
[5256.54s -> 5260.22s]  water was trying to kill me. I killed it though. I mean, but like, tell me more about how awesome
[5260.22s -> 5307.10s]  your trip is. Am I underwater? There it is. It's huge though. It's unexpected that I still survived.
[5307.82s -> 5313.10s]  Hey, it's all right. I've got a, I got 11 health pack. I can't even pick him up. I'm doing so well.
[5319.66s -> 5332.25s]  Extreme, extreme. No, that's not. Okay. We're good. I have to, I need to lure somebody over
[5332.25s -> 5347.08s]  here to do this to them. She's afraid of you. Oh, wait. It's, this is like a new checkpoint.
[5347.08s -> 5363.96s]  Hold on. What's over here? I've already been here. It's like that game, you know, that game
[5363.96s -> 5368.12s]  where you, where you've hit the ice down, the little squares and the penguin falls through the
[5368.12s -> 5381.19s]  middle. God, I've loved that game. Here we go. Where's the, where's it? Oh, right here.
[5382.07s -> 5396.23s]  Somebody just crashed a car. I want to use this. Can I roll it? This doesn't hurt me, right? Okay.
[5396.23s -> 5412.82s]  I think I can do this. Is it on the ground? I don't think I can do it unless I can hit it right
[5412.82s -> 5421.34s]  here. Get it out of the, okay. Now, what the, how the fuck does that physics make any sense? I'm
[5421.34s -> 5433.11s]  trying to roll this way. Keep going. All right. If you hit it in the front, it rolls backwards.
[5435.94s -> 5463.08s]  Fuck it. All right. I did not expect them to be standing right here. They do this thing where
[5463.08s -> 5467.08s]  it's almost like they're auto targeted on you and they're strafing around you. So their hand goes
[5467.08s -> 5472.52s]  like aiming at like different directions behind them and to the right and left of them.
[5483.40s -> 5515.56s]  This is my opportunity. He just kicked me in the face and killed me. How far away am I?
[5516.68s -> 5528.07s]  What the fuck? Why did I not save it? No, I did. I did. Okay. I'm, you know, I'm,
[5528.07s -> 5533.59s]  I just need to make a macro in this game or just like a script that runs in the background that
[5533.59s -> 5552.26s]  presses F5 every 10 minutes. That's not illegal. Oh shit. We both did the same thing. Where is this
[5552.26s -> 5584.57s]  person? Don't die again. I'm stuck in the, my DPI just, why? What is happening? I'm using health
[5584.57s -> 5599.85s]  potions. He's using this spin bot. Okay. There it is. HP. Was that an arm? Okay.
[5604.20s -> 5624.49s]  No, this is not that, this is not that far. Yep. I don't, why do I not remember this?
[5625.21s -> 5640.30s]  Anybody else not remember this? The game icebreaker right in the middle. I missed him. It
[5640.30s -> 5650.49s]  doesn't matter. I don't remember this at all. Did I go a different way? I think I went a different way.
[5662.73s -> 5707.08s]  Shit. I got one. All right. Who's left? Anybody? Still left. Got it. Open the valve. Not yet. All
[5707.08s -> 5717.42s]  right. Lots of ammo over here though. Gimme, gimme, gimme. That's all. I have too much of this. It's
[5717.42s -> 5726.84s]  all right. I like to use, this thing's better, stronger, faster, less recoil. All right. Let's
[5726.84s -> 5733.18s]  go. You're playing, I'm playing daft punk. What do you mean daft punk?
[5757.62s -> 5803.78s]  Get him. One grenade. Got it. It's like the, got it. Got reflex booster. Got it. I want to go this
[5803.78s -> 5812.28s]  way. Shoot the grenade in midair. Oh, absolutely. We're doing that next. Second, I get an
[5812.28s -> 5827.67s]  opportunity to. I'm doing that. I got one chance. What is this? Buoy? Looks like we're going down.
[5828.23s -> 5842.54s]  What the fuck did I just do? I'm throwing my, that's a G. Throws your gun on the ground. Okay.
[5843.26s -> 5855.19s]  Why would you ever do that? F and G being that close to each other is going to be very, very bad.
[5858.06s -> 5874.55s]  I don't think I want those two bound. Throw all your guns on the ground. All melee run.
[5875.19s -> 5905.46s]  Oh, sour please. Here we go. What does that do? Raises the water level or I don't know. It does
[5905.46s -> 5912.52s]  something to the water. What does it say? Caution. Operate shouldn't buy certified operators only.
[5913.40s -> 5936.30s]  Okay. Ooh, it's full now and that can go over that way. All right. I don't trust this. What do
[5936.30s -> 5958.06s]  you think? Grenade in there. Okay. That scared the shit out of me. Okay. I don't know. For some
[5958.06s -> 5965.67s]  reason, I thought I had to use that. How is it already broken? Impossible. What? Oh, this is
[5965.67s -> 5971.10s]  where I came from. Right. Thank God. That's, you guys wonder why I'm doing that. Why does he keep
[5971.10s -> 5988.47s]  breaking those? Well, because it's a breadcrumb trip and I know where I've been. Oh baby.
[5990.07s -> 6013.05s]  They're all alive. Dead. I thought he dropped the grenade on the ground. I was going to say, dude,
[6013.13s -> 6025.21s]  what the hell is the matter with you? Great commentary. Dude, what the hell is the matter
[6025.21s -> 6034.25s]  with you? Paying attention and focusing on where I'm going. Words coming out of my mouth to fill
[6034.25s -> 6043.94s]  dead air. Dude. Okay. Is this now? That's what I'm talking about. I'm never going to have another
[6043.94s -> 6067.78s]  gun ever. I love, I love a shoddy. You know what I mean? Ooh, what are those mines? There's nothing
[6067.78s -> 6103.46s]  in there. There's nothing in there. Oh, I don't, I can't. I mean, that was cool, but I thought he
[6103.46s -> 6119.86s]  was dead. Why haven't I been, are you serious? It bounced off the ceiling. It bounced off the
[6119.86s -> 6141.00s]  ceiling, but it's okay. I still got it. Garlic bacon burger. That's a lot of fun to do, but I can
[6141.00s -> 6149.19s]  stop doing that. That's pretty dang fun to do, but not going to do that anymore. Here we go.
[6149.19s -> 6155.27s]  Shotgun save the game. Here we go. I'm not messing around anymore. Watch this one. Just going for it.
[6158.33s -> 6162.81s]  Mine. Just pick it up. Let's get a couple of these. Proximity. Press five to switch
[6162.81s -> 6202.60s]  proximity. Okay. I'm telling you, they're not throwing them right. What's that? Okay.
[6208.18s -> 6216.23s]  Through the middle. Oh shit. It spins. No, I thought it was a gray. It wasn't a gray.
[6220.50s -> 6231.24s]  What the fuck did you come from the ceiling? What? That guy fell from the ceiling.
[6234.94s -> 6251.70s]  Why are you crawling over here? Oh, this game is fucking ridiculous. I love it. Okay. Oh, what?
[6251.70s -> 6265.37s]  I hear auto. Oh shit. The wrong button. Ah, let me explain. Let me explain. Let me explain.
[6266.62s -> 6273.02s]  This is melee. This is grenade. I got to stop putting these so close to each other.
[6279.27s -> 6310.97s]  Grenade. Where is he? Up there. Come on. Fall. That sucks. Okay. Got some stuff. Back to the
[6310.97s -> 6333.43s]  shotgun. Move, move, move, move. Get up. What are you doing? What the fuck am I? What? Okay.
[6333.43s -> 6354.17s]  That doesn't work. I need explosions. Oh, we really would be great if I had, you know,
[6354.17s -> 6359.85s]  a couple of land mines would be fantastic right now, but I don't have them. I don't have any.
[6370.87s -> 6404.68s]  Where is he? It didn't do anything. Why did he just turn off? Why was it so loud? What is this
[6404.68s -> 6416.55s]  thing? Oh shit. It's like a rail gun. All right. Save it. All right. Hold on. I think I got to go
[6416.55s -> 6546.84s]  let auto outside. Give me a second. I'll be right back. I got to go see auto. Okay. He is taken care
[6546.84s -> 6553.64s]  of. And while there's a lot of people here, I do want to talk about this because I brought
[6553.64s -> 6559.27s]  it up in the beginning of the stream, but there weren't a whole lot of people here at the very
[6559.27s -> 6567.51s]  beginning. So this week I'm on a couple of new medications for my stomach and they're kind of
[6567.51s -> 6574.63s]  like fucking me up a little. So what we're going to do is instead of streaming like six or seven
[6574.63s -> 6580.55s]  hours a few times, we're going to do like four or five hours, like five times. You know what
[6580.55s -> 6591.64s]  I mean? So there's going to be more streams, but less time on each stream. So just want to make
[6591.64s -> 6597.72s]  sure people are aware of that because there is very specific reason why I will not go into the
[6597.72s -> 6603.00s]  details, but more streams, less time instead of the typical, what you used to is like six to eight
[6603.00s -> 6619.10s]  hours, like six, seven. I got a little nervous about that comment. Let's go. Oh, there I am.
[6619.10s -> 6628.58s]  So that was big guy. Wait, what am I doing? I need two headphones. It's so much better to play
[6628.58s -> 6633.77s]  games with headphones in. I've been missing a lot for the last like two straight decades. Damn.
[6634.41s -> 6642.81s]  Okay. Do I, I want to keep this going for now. Get the shotgun. I want to try this weird laser
[6642.81s -> 6671.98s]  pointer. Yes. Yes. I'm so happy it did that. Pulling out. Are they afraid of me?
[6672.70s -> 6678.58s]  Do I have them in a full retreat? What did I just do? I just put, I didn't pick up anything.
[6679.22s -> 6687.00s]  Why did it just took a health push? I didn't press anything. I did not press the button to
[6687.00s -> 6700.36s]  do that. Ooh, found the secret permanent health boost. I'll take it. 115. Nice. I love upgrades.
[6701.24s -> 6705.96s]  How much almond milk do I have in my fridge right now? Zero. Cause it's gone.
[6706.60s -> 6730.41s]  Let's go back. I want to see how this gun works. Is it a one hit kill? Is that guy streaming?
[6730.41s -> 6745.82s]  Where's he aiming? I want to see how he's aiming this gun. It's important to me.
[6748.14s -> 6769.02s]  Nevermind. Oh, this thing is insane. Okay. That's crazy. It's wow. I like this thing.
[6769.02s -> 6787.93s]  Is that gas? Yep. No, it's not. What's going on? Is this room filled with gas? I have no idea.
[6788.89s -> 6801.48s]  Oh, you can get that open, please. Oh, I don't know. Oh shit. What is going on here? Cool, dude.
[6801.48s -> 6824.49s]  How do I get it? Oh, turn the gas off. Yep. Or rise the water. That works too. I got a checkpoint
[6824.49s -> 6841.69s]  here. Hammer. Check the room first. Cause I can now go in here. I thought that was a person
[6841.77s -> 6847.03s]  crouched. Ooh, all right. Shotgun, but how loud is it going to be? Be careful.
[6851.72s -> 6855.48s]  I want this thing. This thing is awesome. One headshot and it just stuck to a wall.
[6855.48s -> 6864.14s]  It's beautiful. I love it. Swap the way. Oh, you can just take any three weapons you want.
[6865.10s -> 6873.64s]  That is very interesting. I'm glad you told me. Interesting stuff. Okay. I thought that one was
[6873.64s -> 6879.64s]  light weapons. Two was medium and three was heavy or something. I don't know. How am I supposed to
[6879.64s -> 6899.90s]  know? Save it right here. What is that? I hear something. Turn the flashlight off. This is a
[6899.90s -> 6909.98s]  place to hide. I'm going to have to hide back here. I know it. Where is Alma? I don't know what you're
[6909.98s -> 6923.34s]  talking about. Some secrets get buried deeper than others. But I know, Mr. Moody, the time for talk
[6923.34s -> 6934.22s]  is done. Please. No. All right. This is the guy. That's the guy we got to get rid of.
[6935.26s -> 6945.03s]  It's a real bad guy. Okay. But wait a minute. Didn't, wasn't there someone else? No, it wasn't. Okay.
[6945.03s -> 6963.45s]  Hey, hey, a crawl, a crawling horror movie trailer girl. Of course. How could I have ever thought it
[6963.45s -> 6968.98s]  was going to be something else? Then on all fours here, I'm running at the camera and then I just
[6968.98s -> 6974.34s]  have to get sucked. I have to land on my stomach and get sucked backwards and then smash into a
[6974.34s -> 7013.21s]  mirror. So, okay. Mission three is pretty much done. No, it's not. Just make it down. Make it
[7013.21s -> 7033.16s]  down. Make it down. Deserve to die. They all deserve to die. I wouldn't be scared. I just
[7033.16s -> 7040.04s]  didn't expect you to be there. No one can look cool when someone startles them. Guys, when Dwayne
[7040.04s -> 7045.40s]  the Rock Johnson is standing there and he's like flexing in a mirror, just like looking huge and
[7045.40s -> 7049.88s]  fucking awesome and somebody comes up behind him and like grabs him, he's going to go,
[7051.64s -> 7085.32s]  you can't, nobody looks cool that way. I'm trying to take out the cameras. What the fuck am I doing?
[7086.44s -> 7105.30s]  All right. Here comes a little scary thing. I'm wasting ammo in this gun. Am I going to stream
[7105.30s -> 7123.19s]  with the rock? No, I don't, I don't think that's going to happen. I'm sorry. What this shit, what
[7123.27s -> 7157.77s]  is it? All right, we got the info we needed. Get out of here. Wait, keep this room clean.
[7157.77s -> 7174.17s]  Something's going to jump out of here. Did I just grab onto it? I can't do anything about it.
[7174.97s -> 7187.22s]  There's nothing I can do, right? I don't think so. Maybe I should go down.
[7187.94s -> 7218.63s]  Clean it. This is not visceral cleanup detail. Oh shit. Okay. It's mine. Get out of here. How do I
[7218.63s -> 7235.88s]  get down there? Got to go like around and down. Okay. I know like, like official, right? People
[7235.88s -> 7243.32s]  are writing like, oh, official Dwayne the Rock Johnson, official the rock. If it were you,
[7244.63s -> 7250.79s]  would you like my, my name is not official German 985. It's just German 985. Why does everybody
[7250.79s -> 7255.67s]  think that that's a way to make it seem like it's legit? No, you would just be the rock.
[7256.31s -> 7275.75s]  Official the rock. What? This guy's stunning. Something in the water. Something in the water.
[7276.31s -> 7298.89s]  They've been putting, they've been putting chlorine. I'm going to be completely honest
[7298.89s -> 7306.17s]  with you guys. Um, I looked over at you guys at chat and, uh, came back and turned my eyes
[7306.17s -> 7311.61s]  on the doors in front of me. And it was more startling than if I actually saw what happened.
[7340.20s -> 7349.29s]  Holy shit. What the hell was that? What was that? What was that floating person?
[7351.21s -> 7371.67s]  What was that? That was fucking weird. All right. I made it. Hey, stop. Why are you getting all scary
[7371.67s -> 7375.35s]  now? Where's the guys? Where's the funny slide tackle the enemies and watch their heads hit the
[7375.35s -> 7451.99s]  ground. You can't be scared of what you can't see. Told you in person. Where is she? Oh, fuck.
[7466.22s -> 7486.87s]  Why did it bounce off of him? What's going on? Do the thing.
[7488.92s -> 7508.20s]  Oh, my. That'll find, sir. Origin. Origin. I knew it. Hit the lights. What do you mean hit the
[7508.20s -> 7521.88s]  lights? You just turned them off and now they're back on. What? Boom. Right in the head. Still
[7521.88s -> 7549.22s]  alive? Right here. Do it. DPI. Fucking DPI. I'm not, I'm underneath you.
[7557.32s -> 7580.17s]  What the fuck is happening? No, wrong button. DPI. Why do you do this to me?
[7581.05s -> 7625.06s]  Did he just say that we're good? I think so. All right. Investigate time.
[7644.31s -> 7650.41s]  Holy fuck. Okay. I don't have any health packs left.
[7650.41s -> 7713.43s]  Why are there so many people in here? You didn't have to do that. You did not have to do that.
[7718.70s -> 7730.81s]  Oh, yeah. Okay. Save it here. I actually could have just had them burned by running down the
[7730.81s -> 7789.18s]  hall. Should I go up here? Save it. Okay. Cool. I got armor. Jesus Christ. Where is this guy?
[7793.67s -> 7827.38s]  Fucking hammer. Where? That is a lot of fun. Where the fuck is he?
[7833.10s -> 7857.62s]  What the fuck was that? Dude, I don't even know where I'm going right now. What's the mission?
[7858.87s -> 7884.76s]  Find packs and fetal. I have no rail gun ammo. Oh, now I do. I'm not going to use it for a little
[7884.76s -> 7909.94s]  bit though. Give me a shotgun. Good ammo. I don't know. I don't know. I know. I know. Saving. Okay.
[7909.94s -> 7913.94s]  Just save it again. Just double save. Just in case your computer crashes when your hard drive is
[7913.94s -> 7917.53s]  broken. That's saving on a different hard drive. You didn't think I thought about that?
[7918.41s -> 7937.83s]  How would you explode from that far away?
[7941.85s -> 7992.10s]  Dammit. No. No, no, no, no, no. Wait. All right. I was going to go backwards.
[8022.58s -> 8043.06s]  Is this guy Canadian? No. I think he's Wisconsin. What the fuck was that? He's putting down mines.
[8045.19s -> 8063.78s]  All right. Mines. So the goal is to get him to walk over his own mines. Sounds like plan B.
[8064.50s -> 8073.14s]  See you guys 45 or so minutes from now when we actually get that to happen.
[8073.70s -> 8106.02s]  Oh, more rail gun to save. Hit the bell. I guess not. Wait, there might be others.
[8113.05s -> 8123.56s]  Grenade. Nothing else I need. All right. I can break that. How close can I get to these proximity?
[8123.56s -> 8127.85s]  So then, I mean, obviously I cannot go over there. What's the distance though? I just need to see.
[8128.95s -> 8135.70s]  Is it one square or is it more than one? All right. That's not bad. I could just shoot it too.
[8135.70s -> 8141.53s]  You're out of the way.
[8150.28s -> 8152.92s]  Once they've got the fire under control, we can check the rubble.
[8155.48s -> 8184.12s]  Not yet. Save it. I've gone. I've been saving. Rats. Can I get through this? No. It's a wall.
[8193.67s -> 8198.62s]  All right. Scary guy just jumps in the water. That means I have to jump in the water too. Or do I?
[8199.58s -> 8205.45s]  I do not have to jump in the water. I get to bypass that whole segment.
[8207.00s -> 8231.91s]  Let's spawn him anyways though. Never mind. Right. Okay. Three shots. One, two, three in the head.
[8231.91s -> 8256.25s]  Here we go. He's going to get stuck to the ceiling. You motherfucker. I swear to God.
[8257.05s -> 8279.03s]  I think that's it. Give me some more rail gun. Nice. All right. I ain't going to just sprint
[8279.03s -> 8285.75s]  over here because if there's one, there's two. If there's two, there's three. And if there's three,
[8285.75s -> 8306.68s]  there's 10. Kind of how this game has been working so far. All right. Is this in the
[8306.68s -> 8324.34s]  source engine? I don't think so. No, it's not. I don't know what this is in. It's probably like
[8324.34s -> 8353.03s]  Unreal or something. One of the old Unreal's. Flashlight off. It's the boomer engine. Health
[8353.03s -> 8369.62s]  upgrade. Good. 120 max HP and a new health. All right. Cool. Damn it. I can't open that.
[8369.62s -> 8384.49s]  Come on. Got to go down here into the water. Fine. This way. This does remind me of Half-Life.
[8386.41s -> 8399.37s]  Even just the sound effects too. That alarm sound. The going through the water sound. It has guns.
[8399.37s -> 8403.85s]  Yeah. That's right. I didn't even think about that. Yeah. I didn't even think about that. It
[8403.85s -> 8413.29s]  has guns. You're right. It's weird. It's got health glued to the wall. Wait. I ended up.
[8415.24s -> 8423.96s]  All right. Fuck it. I don't care. Does that mean I can't go that way?
[8424.60s -> 8450.31s]  Why do I feel like this is going to kill me? Shit. How did I go all the way back around?
[8451.98s -> 8459.00s]  There is fall damage. What? Just run fast. Run fast.
[8488.90s -> 8492.82s]  My body is exploding. It's disintegrating. So no, that's not how this works.
[8493.46s -> 8499.93s]  Just use a health kit. Guys, I'm spamming T. It's not going to work. I'm out. I'm going that way.
[8500.65s -> 8509.70s]  I will pick this up though. Shit. I went the wrong way.
[8514.81s -> 8525.13s]  Back down here. Where did I go wrong? One of these big rooms back here.
[8528.12s -> 8539.24s]  I shot the mines. Yeah. Yeah. I did. I didn't know it was going to cause electricity
[8539.24s -> 8545.58s]  all over the place. Use a grenade and boost yourself. I don't think that's going to work.
[8551.35s -> 8556.73s]  This is where I remember this up. Should I go up here or should I go down there?
[8557.69s -> 8577.48s]  I'm going to go up that way. I actually almost just made it. I almost just made it.
[8581.70s -> 8586.82s]  Okay. So there's a bottom there that there's no water underneath. It just goes all the way down.
[8586.82s -> 8593.06s]  That's good to know. So you don't shortcut jump that just go around and go up. Very good to know.
[8600.62s -> 8603.18s]  I'm not going to bunny hop through it. I'm going to go the right way.
[8604.46s -> 8616.71s]  There's no bunny hopping in this game anyways. Why am I even trying? I know it doesn't exist.
[8616.71s -> 8627.27s]  Why would I try it? See, I thought there was water here. Here we go. Ladder up this way.
[8627.27s -> 8640.17s]  I didn't go up here. Maybe I did. Let's try it. Okay. And then is that the? Oh, here it is.
[8640.97s -> 8651.93s]  I haven't. Okay. This is the electric. That's the electric. Oh no. The health kit. Oh, here we go.
[8653.70s -> 8673.32s]  Solved it. Nice. All right. Let's keep going. 35 armor. Feels pumpkin man.
[8673.32s -> 8678.07s]  Feels pumpkin man. What's feels pumpkin man? I can't see it.
[8685.56s -> 8701.98s]  Okay. Mine's. Yeah, I do have a BTTV. The thing is though, I'm your chat right now is coming
[8701.98s -> 8709.34s]  through Streamlabs. The Streamlabs OBS. So I don't know if I can have BTTV through Streamlabs.
[8710.90s -> 8715.99s]  That's a new gun and there's more health. All right. New gun. What is this?
[8717.13s -> 8727.24s]  ASP rifle. Oh, that's pretty great. Actually. I love that noise too. Perfect. All right. I don't
[8727.24s -> 8737.27s]  need the assault rifle. I want this. How many bullets? 30, 15. Okay. Remote bomb. Remote bombs
[8737.27s -> 8741.27s]  stick to almost any surface, including enemies and can be manually detonated, making them ideal
[8741.27s -> 8748.09s]  for traps. Oh, don't do this to me. Don't give me this kind of shit. You don't want me to have this.
[8751.19s -> 8756.30s]  You sincerely do not want me to have this, but you gave it to me anyways. So
[8758.30s -> 8771.99s]  I'm just going to use it immediately. Over here. Wait. I was already over here.
[8774.70s -> 8789.64s]  Is there a straight? Straight through here. I came up that way. So, huh. We're just downstairs.
[8792.36s -> 8797.24s]  Here comes the blew myself up joke. No, I'm not. I'm it's blow the other guy up joke.
[8797.24s -> 8815.91s]  We've lost contact with the search team. How would you even see me?
[8817.75s -> 8832.82s]  Is it playing the game that you don't throw with like that? That's just the detonator, but
[8836.12s -> 8851.24s]  okay. I get it. I understand. I didn't. I thought you'd be like threw it with that or like,
[8851.24s -> 8862.70s]  I get it. It's okay. Nice placement. Can I break this window without them freaking out about this?
[8863.42s -> 8872.63s]  I didn't do what? Let me check it out. You heard the wind.
[8892.20s -> 8896.36s]  It's not satisfied. I was not satisfying enough. I don't. That's a lot of people in there.
[8897.48s -> 8924.97s]  That's pretty cool. Works pretty well. Pretty cool. So we get regular grenades. We have,
[8924.97s -> 8936.07s]  okay. Do I have one regular grenade? Okay. Storm troopers. Their aim is sort of as bad as storm
[8936.07s -> 8941.24s]  trooper. I want to try the sniper rifle. I'm going to snipe somebody. Who can I snipe? Right
[8941.24s -> 8969.05s]  here. Nice. Should I go down? Ooh, there's more of this. Okay. So we need. I mean, I have.
[8969.61s -> 8981.69s]  That's what I currently have. More ammo for that thing. Pretty nice. Pretty nice. I wish it was
[8981.69s -> 8989.59s]  only a one shot. I don't want the first. I only need is one bullet, not four, because it goes,
[8989.67s -> 8994.71s]  did it in, did it in, right? Did it in. What are they? What are they? What are they?
[8997.74s -> 9008.26s]  Something like that. Let's see. What are they? That helicopter is huge.
[9019.61s -> 9026.63s]  You only dropped two. Why didn't like 10 people come out of there?
[9027.27s -> 9051.00s]  No, don't waste them. I'm up. I'm up close now. Get the shotgun hazard. I didn't even use the
[9051.00s -> 9093.91s]  hazard really. Nope. Nothing. How do you hear me? Where are they? Where is he?
[9094.31s -> 9106.65s]  Are they upstairs in the room? Movement. Who threw that?
[9112.33s -> 9183.48s]  Is he dead? I am fucking around. Let's go. I'm no more screwing around. Wait for my signal. Yeah.
[9183.48s -> 9214.26s]  It's called. You're dead. It was me. Oh, he fucking missed. Fail.
[9215.06s -> 9282.41s]  Who the fuck are you? Oh, I got it. Come on. Did I get him? I couldn't even think about it.
[9282.41s -> 9311.72s]  Where is he? It's right there. All right. Those guys are tricky. Those guys are hard.
[9311.72s -> 9320.02s]  What else you got? Submachine gun. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What do I got? 25 shots.
[9321.82s -> 9327.90s]  Bad. All right. I got three health packs. It's good. Not terrible. Not great. Not good either,
[9327.90s -> 9339.26s]  though. That's where he came from. Very nice. Okay. You missed a health pack. Did I miss a health
[9339.26s -> 9360.73s]  pack? Where do you see that? Oh, oh, you got baited. Baited. I don't think I did. I think I'm
[9360.73s -> 9380.47s]  doing just fine. All right. Straight through. My point man's current position.
[9381.51s -> 9391.10s]  Problem is there's an enemy gunship sitting there at the moment. Oh shit. Thanks. Nice. Okay. Turn
[9391.10s -> 9399.26s]  the light off. 70. Ooh. That's exactly what I want. Got 45 in this now. I'm going to use the
[9399.26s -> 9406.12s]  shotgun. Yeah. Shotguns. Look at those ammo. That's way too much ammo. Comcast. Yeah. That's right.
[9406.12s -> 9419.08s]  Sounds like they're saying. All right. Uh, good. We're good. We're good. Save it. Someone's going
[9419.08s -> 9437.72s]  to pop around the corner. I'm not going to shoot him right in the face. Or not. This is going to
[9437.72s -> 9458.47s]  alert people. Just don't just walk. You can make it in there. You seriously can. You really can. I
[9458.47s -> 9478.44s]  know you can get in there. You can fit inside of that. You are not as big as this. I don't want
[9478.44s -> 9496.04s]  that though. No, I like what I have right now. Helicopter battle. Looks like it. I'll put you
[9496.04s -> 9525.85s]  can go through that. Right. You can go through that. Uh, nine shots in this. Hey, what? Nice aim.
[9525.85s -> 9591.24s]  Idiot. Oh no. Not another one. Okay. I need. Is that a person? No. Run away. NA aim. NA aim.
[9591.24s -> 9624.20s]  Explosives. I have one of these. Okay. I'm going to use this one first. Did I not throw it far
[9624.20s -> 9634.71s]  enough? Why do you have so much HP? It's just not even fair to us that don't have those suits.
[9650.44s -> 9672.54s]  Oh, I just panicked and had to try. Okay. I have to replace something. Maybe not. Did I do it?
[9672.54s -> 9689.59s]  This is the, oh, that's the evac point. Interval four.
[9697.19s -> 9702.47s]  How do I like the game so far? It's good. It's fun just to shoot and there's some weird stuff going on.
[9704.07s -> 9721.98s]  Look at that water. It is pretty beautiful. Drop the scope gun. Ammo forward is too scarce
[9721.98s -> 9726.94s]  for it to be viable. Yeah. I guess, you know, that's probably true considering
[9728.62s -> 9731.90s]  when you, it's not like it's that big of a difference.
[9733.66s -> 9741.38s]  Really guys. Really? What? Okay. That was a little.
[9741.38s -> 9769.05s]  That guy has three in his head. He has three in his head. Why are you still alive?
[9771.93s -> 9794.60s]  Holy shit. You are a maniac. This is the kind of shit that happens to people in BR,
[9794.60s -> 9798.60s]  like in Fortnite and shit. You're just jumping around trying to get that and,
[9798.60s -> 9807.08s]  oh, I just got fortnighted. I got like, what? How did I insta fucking die?
[9807.08s -> 9826.70s]  Why? That guy's not dead. Can we be clear about that? He was still alive.
[9854.63s -> 9860.42s]  I thought it was going to bounce back. I had this, I was just being a cameraman. I'm sorry.
[9860.98s -> 9879.93s]  He's got it out. Instantly killing me.
[9880.89s -> 9896.97s]  Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Okay. I need to pay. Okay. This is,
[9897.69s -> 9903.06s]  I'm going to run. I'm going. Here's the plan. You ready? Watch this.
[9908.81s -> 9917.53s]  Oh, this is not the shotgun. Oh shit.
[9917.53s -> 10020.66s]  Where is he? Fuck. Where'd he go? Whoa. He fell off the edge. Oh shit. I got him. Okay.
[10020.66s -> 10028.65s]  Um, I need to tap a new gun or something. What's this? Oh, that's a nice one. No,
[10028.65s -> 10049.35s]  it's one I just threw over here. Okay. I'm going to save it here. I have no health.
[10049.35s -> 10071.27s]  Is he going to do it? What do you think? No, he's not. We need 20 more. Oh shit.
[10071.27s -> 10080.57s]  I don't think we need more than those. Pre-recorded. What'd it say? Pre-recorded.
[10080.57s -> 10140.58s]  Bleach. Oh, no. All right. I don't want to make noise and stay down. Health. Nice. 130.
[10140.58s -> 10164.34s]  I feel like you were waiting for me. 200 is max. That makes sense. Watch out for that gas.
[10176.76s -> 10203.30s]  What did he just throw? Check it. All right. What, what did you, did you pre-fire me? Okay.
[10203.30s -> 10221.29s]  Guys, I, he's, he's pre, just kill me. I'll do it again. Where should I go? I love it. He's just
[10221.29s -> 10227.21s]  holding down the trigger on me, screaming, where should I go? I'm so scared. This guy's
[10227.21s -> 10232.68s]  fucking terrifying. If the grenade throw, if the grenade pops up here, I'm going to be very mad.
[10235.96s -> 10283.90s]  All right. There's no grenade. Oh shit. That's so funny. This bitch jumps at like, like 10%.
[10283.90s -> 10300.86s]  Dude, dude pulls out a shotgun. Oh shit. He gets his fucking face blown off. The guy next to him.
[10300.86s -> 10311.80s]  Oh shit. Oh, this game's fucking awesome. Oh, that's fucking real. That's just really stupid.
[10312.90s -> 10348.06s]  That's really stupid. Oh, okay. Hold on. I have to compose myself here. Let's get this together.
[10354.33s -> 10364.28s]  I was hoping he was going to say, oh shit. Oh shit.
[10370.22s -> 10393.29s]  I don't know why it's making me laugh so bad right now. What is he aiming at?
[10394.01s -> 10413.37s]  I just got, I get stuck on something and I can't, I can't get away from it.
[10433.99s -> 10452.39s]  Why wouldn't you do anything? Protect yourself. Okay. He was scared.
[10465.96s -> 10491.91s]  Whoa. I held the button for too long. You guys are played, uh, smash TV.
[10493.03s -> 10523.90s]  He's not going to use the stairs. It reminds me of the, no way. No way. That game is so good.
[10523.90s -> 10551.03s]  I should play that game on stream. I'm starting to kind of lose it. It's too ridiculous sometimes.
[10551.27s -> 10566.46s]  You got mortal combated. Yeah. He did like a high punch, mid kick, high punch, mid kick. He was
[10566.46s -> 10571.61s]  trying to do a combo. So yeah, it's all right. It's okay. Sometimes you mess up the, mess up the
[10571.61s -> 10599.50s]  button combos. He was trying to do like the sub zero freeze. I don't. That's true. You do have that
[10600.38s -> 10622.70s]  right. Okay. Let's, oh, save it. All right. I'm good. Two health packs. What's with this?
[10622.70s -> 10638.50s]  Here comes the music. What's with the, here comes the music. A lot of people out there.
[10667.32s -> 10679.32s]  Good. Can somebody, can I watch that clip? Can somebody cut the, oh shit. Oh shit. It's,
[10679.40s -> 10685.61s]  it won't get out of my head. I just, I need to see it again. I don't care about anything
[10685.61s -> 10695.18s]  else right now. I just want to see it again. Like you get, you can watch it like on your own time.
[10695.18s -> 10735.35s]  I just, I need to see it again. It's funny. Okay. I just want to remind myself if it's funny or not.
[10741.06s -> 10748.47s]  All right. I just needed to, sometimes you need to be reminded if it was funny. Okay. So
[10749.43s -> 10758.63s]  I'm going to go up this way. Darn it. Darn it. Healing sticks.
[10764.47s -> 10773.34s]  Wait a minute. Oh, through the glass. I need to jump through the glass.
[10778.34s -> 10824.66s]  I did this already. How did I, I hold up the sign that says, uh-oh. And then I fall. Locate
[10824.66s -> 10832.10s]  and reset the network. I'll try. I need healing. I need healing very, very badly.
[10832.82s -> 10842.38s]  Oops. Now no one will ever get into the network. Okay. You got to wedge it with something.
[10843.10s -> 10847.96s]  Just stick something in there. I got to wedge something in there. First of all,
[10847.96s -> 10859.34s]  let's get some refreshments. I don't think there is any refreshments. No, there is not.
[10859.98s -> 10879.50s]  Somebody in here watching this. Okay. That's pretty, that's pretty funny. That's pretty great.
[10879.50s -> 10891.18s]  It actually moves the projector around too. That's, I love it. That's great.
[10891.90s -> 10915.18s]  This is, that's highly detailed for 2004. Hey, open this. No, not, not if I can be open until
[10915.18s -> 10936.68s]  the network's back online. Anything in here? Health pack. Nothing. When there are horror
[10936.68s -> 10974.81s]  game like this, we walked around in the office. Oh shit. Stay out of my way. What is up above here?
[10974.81s -> 10981.78s]  Oh, computer. The data is uploading now. There's a reference of something called Icarus. It says
[10981.78s -> 10986.98s]  here that it was a bioengineering program that started in 1973. Something about health issues
[10986.98s -> 10991.46s]  related to microgravity, loss of muscle mass, bone density, shit like that.
[10992.50s -> 11003.38s]  Well, it's shit. Okay. Oh, I mean, it's the other side. Okay.
[11005.50s -> 11013.42s]  Assault rifle. I was, I've talked a lot of shit about how much health I had and how many health
[11013.42s -> 11019.74s]  packs I had. And now that I switched over to hard mode, I've not had as many health packs. They,
[11020.22s -> 11041.80s]  spawn less. Enemies take more damage. It's a lot harder. Nope. I was going to say it's going to
[11041.80s -> 11054.52s]  open up and scream. I knew it. I fucking knew. I told you, I knew that shit was going to happen.
[11055.40s -> 11064.38s]  Fucking Venetian blinds. I'm telling you, they're the worst invention in history.
[11065.90s -> 11074.07s]  I will never have Venetian blinds in my house. I don't understand why you want these huge,
[11074.87s -> 11078.95s]  obnoxious pillars that get in the way of everything you do when you open a door.
[11079.94s -> 11087.29s]  Why are they still putting these in houses? Why? Everybody hates them. Every single person hates
[11087.29s -> 11094.94s]  these things. Ask anybody that has them. Oh, yeah. They suck ass. Oh, okay. Why are they in your
[11094.94s -> 11108.01s]  house? I don't know. Get a curtain. No, I don't want to get a curtain. That means I have to
[11108.73s -> 11113.69s]  go to the Home Depot and get a curtain and put it up. I'll just deal with the,
[11114.25s -> 11117.69s]  like the swinging pendulums of death every time I open my slider.
[11125.82s -> 11161.10s]  How do you leave a voicemail on a public phone? Later. The glossy TV. You should get a matte TV.
[11161.10s -> 11167.10s]  Never buy a glossy TV. And if anyone wants to argue with glossy screen versus matte screen,
[11167.90s -> 11173.10s]  I'm sorry, but you're going to lose every time. I will win that argument every single time.
[11173.74s -> 11192.98s]  Oh, it's a satellite. Okay. How many, what do I have? Three. Okay. I have four. I have three grenades
[11192.98s -> 11210.04s]  and let's get the shotgun out. Comes a jumpscare. No, no jumpscare in here. That's strange. I would
[11210.04s -> 11228.20s]  have thought it would be. What's that? All right. I thought that was this gun. Hello? I'm walking.
[11228.20s -> 11252.70s]  Stop walking. I'm freaking out right now. Okay. Just don't kill me. Kill me. That was bullshit.
[11252.70s -> 11281.42s]  I'll do it. That was terrifying. I'll be ready this time. That's like, what?
[11283.02s -> 11290.97s]  This is unbelievable. There's no way I'm visible. Well, they're in the game now. That's great. I
[11290.97s -> 11319.86s]  can't wait to deal with that. Look for the little wiggly lines. Dead. Place to go up there. Can I
[11319.86s -> 11365.24s]  jump up that? No, I can't. Got him. If you only knew how to defeat me. Chuck Hamburger?
[11440.44s -> 11452.97s]  So we've got, nice. Good. We've got a, I've got to go up somehow.
[11453.77s -> 11462.42s]  I have to go up that shaft over here. How am I going to do that? Is there another way to get up
[11462.42s -> 11479.18s]  there? Can I, I guess I could just go through here. All right. Be ready because I'm trying to
[11479.18s -> 11484.78s]  put the nail in the guy's head. I see electricity. That's what, I know what that means. There's
[11484.78s -> 11514.44s]  electricity. He's running above me. I don't know why that scared me. I don't know. I was ready for
[11514.44s -> 11544.04s]  it, but it still did it. I don't know why. Why is this opening? Oh, look, look. It's an, it's office
[11544.04s -> 11558.41s]  space. TPS report. Red stapler. What's this say? November. Oh me. That's an office space
[11558.41s -> 11564.25s]  reference. That's a pretty good movie too. Never seen office space. Go watch it. Right now. Just
[11564.25s -> 11615.99s]  go get it. What? I think grenades. Don't touch that dial. We're just getting started. Thanks.
[11615.99s -> 11639.10s]  Appreciate the feedback. What the fuck was that? What's wrong with me? Why is everything all spooky?
[11643.11s -> 11658.98s]  Show yourself. That's all it took is right in the stomach. All right.
[11660.34s -> 11679.10s]  Shotgun is way better for these guys. You just plant one right in the face. I thought that was a
[11679.10s -> 11697.54s]  mine. Computer. Ooh. All right. He's uploading. Looks like the Icarus program got shut down in
[11697.54s -> 11702.82s]  favor of something called Perseus, which from what I can tell is funded by DMZ. I'm guessing that's
[11702.82s -> 11735.08s]  where Fettel had been sold. Server room. I can't go in server room. Guy live. Hello. That's silent
[11735.08s -> 11758.46s]  in here. Why? Oh you piece of shit. Where are you? Bye. Where's he? Don't shoot. It's Norton
[11758.46s -> 11781.59s]  Mapes. I'm an engineer. What? Give him a comm link. Hello. This is a human Garfield. I'm having a
[11781.59s -> 11791.10s]  hell of a time. He said you're an engineer. Tell you what. You disable the local security system
[11791.10s -> 11796.38s]  and I'll see what I can do about the server. I can disable it remotely once I'm locked in.
[11796.38s -> 11810.55s]  No, you can't. It's on a separate network. To bring down the security system anyway.
[11813.62s -> 11819.94s]  It's happened. You want my help? That's the price. What's going on? He's eating the grenades.
[11827.58s -> 11844.06s]  What else does he eat? Will you eat anything else? Whoa. Wait, hold on. Just wait here.
[11845.02s -> 11861.35s]  Okay. Back up. That's the price. Okay. That's it. We're good. Just wait here.
[11864.71s -> 11877.45s]  He's just an NPC. Whoops. Restart it. Restart it. Restart it. Restart it. Restart it.
[11879.13s -> 11898.26s]  Uh oh. Human. I can't believe human Garfield. That's sad. You want my help? That's the price.
[11898.90s -> 11914.68s]  Okay. What does he want? Just wait here. What's he eating? Those are Cheetos. He's actually eating
[11914.68s -> 11921.54s]  Cheetos. That's fantastic. That's the best character. I wish I could play as that character.
[11922.95s -> 11941.08s]  I feel so much more at home. Human Garfield. That's so funny. Scary. Dark hallway. Don't want
[11941.08s -> 11957.43s]  to go down there yet. Don't do that. Okay. This is his desk. Oh god. Look at this, like,
[11957.43s -> 11965.43s]  gamer chair. Look at this gamer setup. They don't even make Cheetos bags this big.
[11966.07s -> 11974.74s]  That's bigger than the monitor. This is like a 24 inch size Cheetos bag. They don't even make
[11974.74s -> 12015.29s]  these. Well, let's listen to the message. I just want to shatter his computer so he freaks out.
[12018.09s -> 12020.33s]  You know he's had that monitor for like 15 years.
[12035.32s -> 12042.42s]  All right. Let's do some sneaking around and actually stealth kill people.
[12044.02s -> 12084.17s]  I wish I had a little map with a radar. Okay. So far so good. This is it. Let's try to get a clean...
[12084.81s -> 12107.91s]  I mean. I wish I had a silenced gun. Who's down? Am I down here? I mean,
[12107.91s -> 12139.72s]  how did you know I was up there in the first place? Holy shit. What was that?
[12139.72s -> 12156.54s]  What's that?
[12156.54s -> 12159.80s]  You see him?
[12159.80s -> 12161.80s]  Yup, yup, yup, yup.
[12186.18s -> 12190.90s]  What? Bullshit.
[12190.90s -> 12194.79s]  Bullshit.
[12194.79s -> 12196.79s]  Alright, that's it.
[12196.79s -> 12198.79s]  I've had just about enough of this shit.
[12198.79s -> 12200.79s]  I've had just about enough of this.
[12200.79s -> 12205.78s]  Wrong button.
[12205.78s -> 12209.24s]  Whatever, just die.
[12209.24s -> 12211.24s]  Are you really throwing a grenade?
[12211.24s -> 12216.28s]  I thought he was
[12216.28s -> 12218.28s]  Like, I'm gonna do it.
[12218.28s -> 12230.06s]  I'm getting ready.
[12230.06s -> 12233.64s]  There, right there.
[12233.64s -> 12235.64s]  Right there, right there.
[12235.64s -> 12253.29s]  What was that? Did he fall?
[12253.29s -> 12255.29s]  Who's fucking tripping around?
[12274.15s -> 12278.82s]  Clean. Clean.
[12278.82s -> 12280.82s]  Very clean.
[12280.82s -> 12290.49s]  Okay, healing.
[12290.49s -> 12293.56s]  What else we got? Nothing else here.
[12293.56s -> 12297.46s]  I'll take the
[12297.46s -> 12299.46s]  I'll take the shotgun and the shells.
[12299.46s -> 12301.96s]  We good, we good.
[12301.96s -> 12310.92s]  Armor.
[12310.92s -> 12316.74s]  Nice.
[12316.74s -> 12318.74s]  117 shots in this thing.
[12318.74s -> 12321.88s]  That's pretty good.
[12321.88s -> 12323.88s]  Oh damn, alright.
[12323.88s -> 12330.47s]  Decision time.
[12330.47s -> 12338.09s]  Wait, what the? Grenades?
[12338.09s -> 12340.39s]  Shotgun.
[12340.39s -> 12342.39s]  And then I have
[12342.39s -> 12344.39s]  Do I have full ammo with this?
[12344.39s -> 12347.21s]  I think so.
[12347.21s -> 12350.09s]  Actually, it wasn't really that cool.
[12350.09s -> 12354.12s]  Oh well.
[12354.12s -> 12356.12s]  I have full ammo for everything.
[12356.12s -> 12359.19s]  Good. What's that?
[12359.19s -> 12364.74s]  Activate.
[12364.74s -> 12366.74s]  Got it.
[12377.14s -> 12379.64s]  Locate and reset the network hub.
[12379.64s -> 12381.64s]  I will try.
[12381.64s -> 12384.07s]  Server room is down here.
[12384.07s -> 12386.82s]  Right?
[12386.82s -> 12393.93s]  Where was it?
[12393.93s -> 12395.93s]  Where was the server room?
[12395.93s -> 12403.78s]  Back here?
[12403.78s -> 12405.78s]  There's a label. Server room.
[12405.78s -> 12409.05s]  Come on in.
[12409.05s -> 12414.55s]  Back at the beginning?
[12414.55s -> 12429.06s]  Target.
[12429.06s -> 12431.06s]  Target.
[12431.06s -> 12434.84s]  Get that open.
[12451.16s -> 12459.80s]  What?
[12461.80s -> 12467.24s]  I'm not using this gun.
[12467.24s -> 12478.76s]  I'm using a shotgun from down the hall.
[12481.58s -> 12487.85s]  Server room. There we go.
[12487.85s -> 12489.85s]  Alright, save it. Now...
[12496.33s -> 12498.33s]  Wait, hold on.
[12498.33s -> 12507.35s]  Let me go in here first.
[12507.35s -> 12514.84s]  Alright, that hurt.
[12514.84s -> 12518.23s]  Reboot the network.
[12518.23s -> 12521.75s]  One, two, three, go!
[12527.88s -> 12529.88s]  Did Jerma find the fat guy?
[12529.88s -> 12548.38s]  He did it!
[12548.38s -> 12557.91s]  He set it!
[12557.91s -> 12559.91s]  Okay. I gotta find the status of this person?
[12559.91s -> 12562.66s]  I guess.
[12562.66s -> 12567.72s]  There's seven shots in this thing.
[12567.72s -> 12569.72s]  That's not gonna cut it.
[12569.72s -> 12577.34s]  Make that a sub sound.
[12577.34s -> 12583.75s]  I can plan under the camera feed, but I don't have any direct access to the system.
[12583.75s -> 12587.59s]  Shoot.
[12587.59s -> 12589.90s]  Wait.
[12589.90s -> 12594.49s]  There's no sub sound?
[12594.49s -> 12596.49s]  Yeah, I kind of muted it.
[12596.49s -> 12598.49s]  After a while.
[12598.49s -> 12608.34s]  Scary!
[12614.81s -> 12616.81s]  It's a really fun thing.
[12616.81s -> 12619.11s]  It's a really cool thing.
[12619.11s -> 12621.61s]  Sometimes if you think about it...
[12621.61s -> 12623.61s]  Let's say there's a bunch of subs.
[12623.61s -> 12627.61s]  Let's say there's a ton of community subs and a bunch of subs.
[12627.61s -> 12629.61s]  It's almost like you constantly have...
[12629.61s -> 12631.61s]  every like...
[12631.61s -> 12633.61s]  two minutes or every one minute...
[12633.61s -> 12635.61s]  just a noise that's just like...
[12635.61s -> 12638.42s]  Hey, keep a track of my head!
[12638.42s -> 12640.60s]  Boink!
[12640.60s -> 12642.60s]  Hey, keep a track of my head!
[12642.60s -> 12644.60s]  Boink!
[12644.60s -> 12646.60s]  Hey, keep a track of my head!
[12646.60s -> 12648.60s]  Boink!
[12648.60s -> 12650.60s]  And that shit happens for fucking seven straight hours.
[12650.60s -> 12652.60s]  And that shit happens for fucking seven straight hours.
[12652.60s -> 12654.60s]  You know how easily distracted I am?
[12654.60s -> 12656.60s]  You know how easily distracted I am?
[12656.60s -> 12658.97s]  It's very, very easy.
[12658.97s -> 12660.97s]  Hold on, this is...
[12660.97s -> 12662.97s]  Hold on, this is Laura going around right now.
[12662.97s -> 12669.48s]  Full health.
[12669.48s -> 12675.11s]  Don't do noise, just the banner?
[12675.11s -> 12677.11s]  The banner should be on.
[12677.11s -> 12679.29s]  It's not because of this. Hold on.
[12679.29s -> 12681.29s]  The banner should actually...
[12681.29s -> 12683.78s]  The banner should still be there.
[12683.78s -> 12686.15s]  But it's because I had to capture this strangely.
[12686.15s -> 12690.70s]  It should be there.
[12690.70s -> 12705.10s]  It should be there now.
[12705.10s -> 12720.20s]  Unknown origin.
[12720.20s -> 12725.06s]  This room's on fire.
[12725.06s -> 12727.82s]  I don't...
[12727.82s -> 12739.85s]  Why are you running at me?
[12739.85s -> 12751.56s]  I'm fine.
[12751.56s -> 12753.56s]  Something is right next to me.
[12753.56s -> 12755.56s]  Something is right next to me.
[12762.70s -> 12764.94s]  I'm here!
[12764.94s -> 12786.74s]  Hey, I'm here!
[12786.74s -> 12790.14s]  Hey, guys.
[12790.14s -> 12792.14s]  There was a lot of anger in this room.
[12792.14s -> 12794.87s]  Great. Better to be useful.
[12794.87s -> 12797.88s]  I don't see any bullet holes.
[12797.88s -> 12799.88s]  There's no brass lying around either.
[12799.88s -> 12801.88s]  These guys didn't fire a shot.
[12801.88s -> 12803.88s]  Then what killed them?
[12803.88s -> 12806.42s]  I don't know.
[12806.42s -> 12808.42s]  Figure it out.
[12808.42s -> 12810.42s]  Alright, buddy, get moving. Fettel's gotta be close.
[12810.42s -> 12812.42s]  I'm not even sure where to start.
[12812.42s -> 12814.42s]  Continue the search for Paxton Fettel.
[12814.42s -> 12817.18s]  Almost complete liquefaction.
[12817.18s -> 12819.35s]  Liquefaction?
[12819.35s -> 12822.30s]  Maybe a chemical agent?
[12822.30s -> 12825.37s]  Hmm.
[12825.37s -> 12827.37s]  It could be a grenade.
[12827.37s -> 12833.26s]  This is going to take some time.
[12833.26s -> 12835.26s]  Did you take photos of the ground?
[12835.26s -> 12844.02s]  What are you doing?
[12844.02s -> 12848.06s]  You're going to delete a lot of those.
[12848.06s -> 12850.06s]  That's why I don't...
[12850.06s -> 12852.06s]  Guys, people ask me.
[12852.06s -> 12854.06s]  Dude, you don't take any pictures of your phone.
[12854.06s -> 12856.06s]  Why don't you take photos?
[12856.06s -> 12858.06s]  I take one photo when I know I want to take a photo.
[12858.06s -> 12860.06s]  When I know I need to take a photo.
[12860.06s -> 12862.06s]  I do not take
[12862.06s -> 12864.06s]  15 or 20 pictures of the same thing.
[12864.06s -> 12866.06s]  I get it right the first time.
[12866.06s -> 12868.36s]  Because then when you...
[12868.36s -> 12870.36s]  If you take like 20 pictures of something you think is interesting.
[12870.36s -> 12872.36s]  You end up...
[12872.36s -> 12874.36s]  You don't even think about it.
[12874.36s -> 12876.36s]  You don't go back and look at those pictures.
[12876.36s -> 12878.36s]  Maybe for potentially months and months and months.
[12878.36s -> 12880.36s]  You'll go to like...
[12880.36s -> 12882.36s]  The Smithsonian.
[12882.36s -> 12884.36s]  And you'll take a picture of like a space shuttle.
[12884.36s -> 12886.36s]  Oh wow, that's so cool.
[12886.36s -> 12888.36s]  The space shuttle, that's awesome.
[12888.36s -> 12890.36s]  That's really fucking interesting.
[12890.36s -> 12892.36s]  And then two years goes by.
[12892.36s -> 12894.36s]  And you have like 16 different
[12894.36s -> 12896.36s]  stupid angles of
[12896.36s -> 12898.36s]  the same space shuttle in the Smithsonian.
[12898.36s -> 12900.36s]  And your phone is at like
[12900.36s -> 12902.36s]  99% capacity.
[12902.36s -> 12904.36s]  And you go, fuck, let's just go back.
[12904.36s -> 12906.36s]  And that's like 1600 photos.
[12906.36s -> 12908.36s]  I guess I'm going to go back and delete all these.
[12908.36s -> 12910.36s]  Take one.
[12910.36s -> 12913.48s]  Just one.
[12913.48s -> 12915.48s]  Get a good one.
[12915.48s -> 12917.48s]  One that you remember.
[12917.48s -> 12919.66s]  You don't have to go like...
[12919.66s -> 12922.02s]  Hold on.
[12922.02s -> 12924.97s]  I want to also do...
[12924.97s -> 12945.24s]  Should I? Oh.
[12945.24s -> 12948.57s]  It's not my hand.
[12948.57s -> 12950.57s]  Just a bug.
[12950.57s -> 12954.60s]  Damn it, my fucking stupid ass thing
[12954.60s -> 12957.16s]  didn't work.
[12957.16s -> 12959.16s]  Come on. Really?
[12959.16s -> 12965.43s]  Do these not break? It would have been fucking funny
[12965.43s -> 12971.64s]  if I did it the first time.
[12971.64s -> 12973.94s]  It's one of those things. Where is it though?
[12973.94s -> 12995.94s]  Full health.
[12995.94s -> 12998.31s]  Let's go. Watch out.
[12998.31s -> 13000.31s]  They're going to spawn.
[13000.31s -> 13002.31s]  They're just throwing...
[13002.31s -> 13004.31s]  There's a health pack in every single room.
[13004.31s -> 13006.31s]  In this level.
[13032.36s -> 13041.06s]  Come on.
[13041.06s -> 13047.53s]  Holy shit, that's too many people.
[13047.53s -> 13049.53s]  Okay, there's a lot of people in there. We gotta change tactics.
[13049.53s -> 13052.73s]  I gotta pick them off one by one.
[13052.73s -> 13054.73s]  Sniping style.
[13064.26s -> 13066.26s]  You walked in front of them.
[13066.26s -> 13068.26s]  And said, oh shit.
[13071.85s -> 13073.85s]  Like, seriously.
[13073.85s -> 13075.85s]  You've got a guy fight. Imagine there's a guy
[13075.85s -> 13077.85s]  right here shooting.
[13077.85s -> 13079.85s]  This guy just goes like this.
[13079.85s -> 13081.85s]  Like the chair is fighting you.
[13086.01s -> 13092.41s]  Oh shit.
[13092.41s -> 13094.41s]  How does he know he's
[13094.41s -> 13096.84s]  in your crosshairs?
[13096.84s -> 13098.84s]  Oh shit. I'm going to get like
[13098.84s -> 13100.84s]  right inside of your...
[13100.84s -> 13103.02s]  aim down sights.
[13103.02s -> 13105.02s]  I know he's looking at me now. I shouldn't have walked
[13105.02s -> 13107.02s]  in front of my colleague who's also
[13107.02s -> 13109.02s]  shooting. I made so many
[13109.02s -> 13111.02s]  mistakes in a row.
[13111.02s -> 13114.66s]  Wait, I can't hear.
[13114.66s -> 13136.47s]  Say it.
[13136.47s -> 13150.94s]  Say it. Say the line.
[13150.94s -> 13152.94s]  Say the line.
[13152.94s -> 13155.43s]  Alright, it's time to stop fucking around.
[13155.43s -> 13157.43s]  Watch this one. Activate.
[13207.46s -> 13212.97s]  Okay, we're good.
[13212.97s -> 13230.10s]  I'm going to use shitties?
[13230.10s -> 13240.47s]  I just frogged that computer.
[13240.47s -> 13301.58s]  Alright, I got plenty of ammo. Shotgun?
[13301.58s -> 13303.88s]  Is that a different shotgun? I don't think so.
[13362.10s -> 13365.24s]  No, you can't apparently.
[13376.25s -> 13378.25s]  Hell!
[13378.25s -> 13380.25s]  What's up?
[13380.25s -> 13382.25s]  I'm trying, man.
[13391.46s -> 13396.70s]  Here.
[13400.70s -> 13402.70s]  Sauer Tower?
[13402.70s -> 13425.91s]  Bye.
[13425.91s -> 13428.79s]  Do what? Okay, go to the elevators.
[13428.79s -> 13435.90s]  I'm really trying to put on
[13435.90s -> 13437.90s]  a good display of video gaming skill.
[13437.90s -> 13439.90s]  I had to just blink my eyes a few times.
[13439.90s -> 13446.17s]  I'm still in it too.
[13446.17s -> 13448.17s]  I'm still in that zone. It's going to happen.
[13448.17s -> 13456.04s]  Elevators.
[13458.04s -> 13460.04s]  Are they?
[13460.04s -> 13462.04s]  Oh, it feels bad for them.
[13462.04s -> 13468.70s]  It feels bad for them.
[13470.70s -> 13476.52s]  Oh, boy. Your head.
[13487.51s -> 13489.51s]  It's no fair.
[13491.69s -> 13493.69s]  They didn't get...
[13493.69s -> 13506.36s]  No!
[13506.36s -> 13508.36s]  We had an opportunity!
[13508.36s -> 13510.36s]  We had an oh shit opportunity!
[13510.36s -> 13512.36s]  It's over!
[13512.36s -> 13528.30s]  I just burped.
[13534.95s -> 13538.79s]  Oh, boy.
[13538.79s -> 13540.79s]  He just got compressed in the elevator.
[13550.14s -> 13552.14s]  I'm not supposed to...
[13552.14s -> 13554.14s]  I'm trying to stifle laughter because I'm like...
[13559.45s -> 13561.45s]  I'm on like medication right now.
[13563.45s -> 13565.45s]  From my stomach.
[13565.45s -> 13567.45s]  And it's like making me very, very tender.
[13567.45s -> 13569.45s]  And sensitive.
[13569.45s -> 13571.45s]  And sore and shit.
[13571.45s -> 13573.62s]  And I...
[13573.62s -> 13576.44s]  I didn't think this game was going to be...
[13579.58s -> 13591.93s]  What?
[13591.93s -> 13595.90s]  You guys didn't think I could pick up a free one?
[13595.90s -> 13602.17s]  What? Ooh.
[13602.17s -> 13604.17s]  Oh, shit!
[13604.17s -> 13608.84s]  Where is the hostage?
[13608.84s -> 13613.26s]  Oh, right. He's down here.
[13613.26s -> 13615.26s]  Where is he? I don't remember. He's over here somewhere.
[13615.26s -> 13619.03s]  Can somebody turn this on?
[13619.03s -> 13621.03s]  I don't know how to get over there.
[13621.03s -> 13626.34s]  Just... There.
[13626.34s -> 13634.22s]  Through the wall that we explored.
[13634.22s -> 13637.35s]  These guys are both dead, by the way.
[13637.35s -> 13639.35s]  This is going to be a...
[13639.35s -> 13642.04s]  Scenario.
[13642.04s -> 13647.48s]  That's all I need to tell you.
[13647.48s -> 13657.66s]  Really?
[13663.96s -> 13665.96s]  Get this shit off me!
[13670.33s -> 13672.33s]  You just...
[13672.33s -> 13675.51s]  You should just...
[13675.51s -> 13685.67s]  You shouldn't just pet it for a while.
[13685.67s -> 13687.67s]  Whatever you're doing.
[13687.67s -> 13689.67s]  Here we go. You and me, let's go!
[13689.67s -> 13691.98s]  Forward!
[13691.98s -> 13695.18s]  Good call. Let's do it. Emergency.
[13695.18s -> 13697.18s]  You and me.
[13697.18s -> 13701.38s]  Yeah, that means you have to go too.
[13701.38s -> 13705.86s]  Yes, I know.
[13705.86s -> 13707.86s]  You're not going to come with me.
[13707.86s -> 13710.30s]  You're just telling me whatever.
[13710.30s -> 13712.47s]  They were taking hostages.
[13712.47s -> 13723.08s]  They were asking about Harlan Wade.
[13723.08s -> 13725.08s]  What happened to human Garfields?
[13725.08s -> 13732.87s]  Our office is in the...
[13732.87s -> 13734.87s]  Oh, nice.
[13734.87s -> 13752.86s]  Health permanent at 9135.
[13752.86s -> 13764.25s]  Up we go.
[13764.25s -> 13766.25s]  Shit just comes back in my head.
[13766.25s -> 13768.25s]  I can't stop it from coming back.
[13768.25s -> 13772.66s]  I feel like I've been hearing this alarm
[13772.66s -> 13776.95s]  for two straight hours.
[13776.95s -> 13786.62s]  Hey, I'll be seeing your mail back.
[13786.62s -> 13788.62s]  Oh, mega lol.
[13788.62s -> 13790.62s]  Shit.
[13790.62s -> 13811.80s]  Alright, turn it off.
[13811.80s -> 13814.17s]  There's been just a constant
[13814.17s -> 13816.17s]  morning alarm going.
[13816.17s -> 13818.17s]  This whole time I've been here.
[13818.17s -> 13821.94s]  It's like, yes, I know. I need to wake up for work.
[13821.94s -> 13826.74s]  Sure.
[13826.74s -> 13828.74s]  150 pounds. I was like, wait, what?
[13828.74s -> 13835.46s]  That's not a lot.
[13835.46s -> 13838.47s]  Alright, get it off. Thank you.
[13838.47s -> 13841.35s]  Did I need those?
[13841.35s -> 13868.47s]  Is there something behind me here?
[13868.47s -> 13870.47s]  I'm just trying to scare... I'm just trying to see if, you know,
[13870.47s -> 13872.47s]  if it's flinched or something.
[13872.47s -> 13878.66s]  Where's my flashlight?
[13878.66s -> 13881.99s]  I don't have a flashlight anymore.
[13881.99s -> 13894.73s]  Well, that's not good.
[13896.73s -> 13898.73s]  No.
[13898.73s -> 13902.82s]  Well, I thought you said...
[13902.82s -> 13911.66s]  I thought you said this didn't work.
[13911.66s -> 13914.34s]  Uh-oh, this is the part that...
[13914.34s -> 13920.17s]  I did it. I made it.
[13920.17s -> 13922.17s]  For a second I was very confused why I could not go this way.
[13922.17s -> 13929.78s]  Biak.
[13929.78s -> 13931.78s]  Biak.
[13931.78s -> 13933.78s]  Biak.
[13933.78s -> 13935.78s]  Head biak. Biak.
[13935.78s -> 13939.50s]  Oh, I can't go through.
[13939.50s -> 13941.50s]  I actually can't do this. I have to do it another way.
[13941.50s -> 13947.38s]  Shit. Really?
[13947.38s -> 13949.82s]  Can I climb anything?
[13949.82s -> 13955.38s]  Yes, I can.
[13955.38s -> 13968.23s]  Why is this...
[13968.23s -> 13970.23s]  This looks like it should be right, but it doesn't
[13970.23s -> 13973.88s]  look like it is.
[13973.88s -> 13988.52s]  Oh, right there.
[13988.52s -> 13994.02s]  Get out that way.
[13994.02s -> 13997.35s]  Anything else here?
[13997.35s -> 13999.35s]  I can stand up right there.
[13999.35s -> 14001.91s]  But I don't think it does anything.
[14001.91s -> 14003.91s]  This is just the beginning of GoldenEye, the facility level.
[14003.91s -> 14006.22s]  Which is the best level.
[14006.22s -> 14008.22s]  Can I tell you guys something?
[14008.22s -> 14010.22s]  When I used to play GoldenEye,
[14010.22s -> 14012.22s]  I actually do not really know
[14012.22s -> 14014.22s]  what the last
[14014.22s -> 14016.22s]  six or seven GoldenEye levels look like.
[14016.22s -> 14018.22s]  Because when I was younger,
[14018.22s -> 14020.22s]  I would just go to the facility.
[14020.22s -> 14022.22s]  That was one of the first games
[14022.22s -> 14024.22s]  where you could kind of just do anything.
[14024.22s -> 14026.22s]  You could just do whatever you wanted.
[14026.22s -> 14028.22s]  There was a mission, but you could just kind of
[14028.22s -> 14030.22s]  go anywhere you really wanted to.
[14030.22s -> 14032.22s]  So what I would do,
[14032.22s -> 14034.22s]  I'm actually...
[14034.22s -> 14036.22s]  Something's fucking wrong with me.
[14036.22s -> 14038.22s]  I'm realizing this right now.
[14038.22s -> 14040.22s]  So I would just go to the facility level
[14040.22s -> 14042.22s]  and find interesting ways to shoot the guy
[14042.22s -> 14044.22s]  that was in the bathroom stall.
[14044.22s -> 14050.17s]  There was a guy in the bathroom
[14050.17s -> 14052.17s]  and you...
[14052.17s -> 14054.17s]  I wanted to try to just, okay,
[14054.17s -> 14056.17s]  get him and then hide and just watch everybody,
[14056.17s -> 14058.17s]  watch the alarms go off and stuff.
[14058.17s -> 14060.17s]  Throw a grenade down there
[14060.17s -> 14062.17s]  and just wait for the alarm to go off
[14062.17s -> 14064.17s]  and then hang out and be like,
[14064.17s -> 14067.50s]  I'm just in the vent, nobody knows!
[14067.50s -> 14070.50s]  If I have...
[14070.50s -> 14072.50s]  Let's say I probably realistically have
[14072.50s -> 14074.50s]  200 to 300 hours in GoldenEye.
[14074.50s -> 14076.50s]  At least 100 of them were
[14076.50s -> 14078.50s]  in the vent in the facility.
[14078.50s -> 14088.41s]  It has to be.
[14088.41s -> 14090.84s]  Seriously.
[14090.84s -> 14096.20s]  Where is it?
[14096.20s -> 14106.49s]  Is that Garfield?
[14106.49s -> 14109.82s]  Oh, okay.
[14109.82s -> 14111.82s]  Looks like somebody already did
[14111.82s -> 14118.73s]  the thing that I was about to do.
[14118.73s -> 14120.73s]  I'm not going to make that same reference.
[14120.73s -> 14122.97s]  They all did it already.
[14122.97s -> 14126.42s]  The data's uploading.
[14126.42s -> 14128.42s]  Well, this confirms the point of Perseus
[14128.42s -> 14130.42s]  was to train telepathic commanders to work with cloned soldiers.
[14130.42s -> 14135.35s]  Why would that kill you?
[14135.35s -> 14140.73s]  Wouldn't you be cushioned by
[14140.73s -> 14142.73s]  all the, like, people?
[14142.73s -> 14144.73s]  This is not that far of a fall.
[14144.73s -> 14157.38s]  And it's just dead.
[14157.38s -> 14161.86s]  Okay. You had some other issues,
[14161.86s -> 14163.86s]  I think, besides just falling down.
[14163.86s -> 14166.55s]  The data's uploading.
[14166.55s -> 14169.11s]  Slide, kick him in.
[14169.11s -> 14171.11s]  Well, this confirms the point of Perseus
[14171.11s -> 14173.11s]  was to train telepathic commanders to work with cloned soldiers.
[14173.11s -> 14175.11s]  Although it looks like Jackson and Fettel
[14175.11s -> 14177.11s]  were the only commanders in the program.
[14177.11s -> 14179.11s]  The weird thing is, they were further invented
[14179.11s -> 14181.11s]  after the drone attack.
[14181.11s -> 14183.42s]  I can't think that's funny.
[14183.42s -> 14185.42s]  I slide in.
[14185.42s -> 14191.80s]  Nope. Okay, we're good.
[14191.80s -> 14193.80s]  All right, thanks for whatever I just did.
[14193.80s -> 14204.55s]  Okay, let's go.
[14204.55s -> 14206.55s]  Open fucking world. You wouldn't do it.
[14206.55s -> 14208.55s]  You wouldn't, like, break this.
[14208.55s -> 14210.55s]  It's a two window there.
[14210.55s -> 14251.30s]  Open fucking world.
[14251.30s -> 14253.80s]  Got it!
[14253.80s -> 14282.78s]  I saw you!
[14282.78s -> 14330.63s]  Here we go!
[14330.63s -> 14332.63s]  Kind of messy, but, you know, I'll take it.
[14332.63s -> 14354.90s]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!
[14354.90s -> 14360.47s]  Sorry, that was fucking sloppy, anyways.
[14360.47s -> 14406.54s]  Go, one, two, three.
[14406.54s -> 14408.54s]  All right, we're good. One, two, three.
[14408.54s -> 14427.42s]  This is a silent fucking gameplay.
[14427.42s -> 14431.38s]  You're gonna try
[14431.38s -> 14433.38s]  to move the thing that's see-through
[14433.38s -> 14446.89s]  in the way so I don't shoot you.
[14446.89s -> 14451.11s]  Bring it on. I see light, I see
[14451.11s -> 14453.11s]  light, I see light.
[14453.11s -> 14463.54s]  Okay, come on, come on, come on, come on. This is the one, this is the one.
[14463.54s -> 14467.32s]  This is right in front of me.
[14467.32s -> 14469.32s]  It's right in front of me. Why did I do that?
[14469.32s -> 14500.28s]  Pick it back up.
[14500.28s -> 14502.28s]  He was waiting for me.
[14502.28s -> 14504.58s]  He wanted to shoot the barrel.
[14504.58s -> 14506.58s]  That's great, I love it.
[14506.58s -> 14508.58s]  He was like, I'm gonna shoot that barrel, I'm gonna shoot that barrel.
[14508.58s -> 14510.58s]  What?
[14510.58s -> 14518.97s]  There's no way you-
[14518.97s -> 14542.70s]  Why were they over there?
[14542.70s -> 14547.37s]  Not this time.
[14547.37s -> 14564.58s]  You idiot. Why are we giving up?
[14566.58s -> 14571.45s]  I'm not giving up on anybody,
[14571.45s -> 14578.74s]  what are we talking about?
[14578.74s -> 14581.74s]  Where?
[14583.74s -> 14590.71s]  It's when I activate it.
[14590.71s -> 14592.71s]  How do they know-
[14592.71s -> 14594.71s]  If I stand still and I activate the slow mo,
[14594.71s -> 14597.08s]  they don't- how do they know?
[14597.08s -> 14599.08s]  They just go, oh no.
[14599.08s -> 14601.08s]  Do I start shaking?
[14601.08s -> 14622.38s]  I thought he was alive.
[14622.38s -> 14624.55s]  Hold on, I'll see-
[14624.55s -> 14626.55s]  Wait.
[14626.55s -> 14632.81s]  My-
[14632.81s -> 14641.83s]  He was trying to kick me.
[14641.83s -> 14651.50s]  This stream is not live. What are you talking about?
[14657.37s -> 14659.37s]  No, we had the same idea!
[14665.13s -> 14667.13s]  What the fuck is that?
[14697.74s -> 14699.74s]  What are you talking about?
[14699.74s -> 14701.74s]  What do you guys mean?
[14701.74s -> 14706.79s]  Look at the funny image, hold on.
[14706.79s -> 14713.83s]  What is it?
[14713.83s -> 14716.33s]  I'm looking, I'm looking.
[14717.33s -> 14720.08s]  It's a very flattering smile.
[14720.08s -> 14722.08s]  Oh my god.
[14722.08s -> 14733.71s]  Is that real though?
[14733.71s -> 14735.71s]  That's real?
[14735.71s -> 14750.56s]  Why do I look like that?
[14750.56s -> 14761.31s]  I don't really look like that though.
[14761.31s -> 14763.87s]  You're getting old.
[14763.87s -> 14775.44s]  Yeah, I know.
[14775.44s -> 14791.17s]  Is he still alive? Where is he?
[14791.17s -> 14795.70s]  Okay, we're good.
[14795.70s -> 14800.61s]  Save it. Bring this up.
[14800.61s -> 14802.61s]  Smile and optimism.
[14807.30s -> 14818.06s]  Three.
[14826.84s -> 14828.84s]  I'm gonna go up ten.
[14828.84s -> 14830.84s]  Full health, super save.
[14830.84s -> 14836.22s]  Oh, okay.
[14836.22s -> 14842.04s]  Shit.
[14865.40s -> 14867.40s]  Nice Waluigi impression.
[14867.40s -> 14870.28s]  Little too much grit though.
[14870.28s -> 14875.40s]  You gotta bring it down a little bit more.
[14875.40s -> 14885.32s]  That was a bad quick save spot.
[14885.32s -> 14903.29s]  It's okay.
[14903.29s -> 14905.29s]  Where is it?
[14905.29s -> 14916.15s]  Alright, I'm going in.
[14916.15s -> 14922.17s]  Fuck it, here we go.
[14922.17s -> 14930.42s]  One, two, three, go!
[14930.42s -> 14932.42s]  Oh, I bounced him.
[14932.42s -> 14938.31s]  Okay, so far so good.
[14938.31s -> 14951.11s]  Flash warning!
[14951.11s -> 14959.35s]  Screams.
[14959.35s -> 14972.92s]  Fuck, wrong way.
[14972.92s -> 14989.35s]  Never mind.
[14989.35s -> 14991.35s]  I'm gonna try something.
[14991.35s -> 14995.50s]  You pick it up with F.
[14995.50s -> 15015.53s]  That was like so...
[15015.53s -> 15017.53s]  It had to have been fake, right?
[15017.53s -> 15021.05s]  Had to have been.
[15021.05s -> 15023.05s]  And I agree with you.
[15023.05s -> 15034.50s]  It had to have been.
[15034.50s -> 15038.90s]  Is it saved? Yeah.
[15038.90s -> 15043.64s]  Get off there!
[15043.64s -> 15046.20s]  Who's...
[15046.20s -> 15049.85s]  He's throwing a grenade?
[15049.85s -> 15055.67s]  What the...
[15055.67s -> 15057.98s]  Why would you throw?
[15057.98s -> 15060.60s]  Whoa!
[15060.60s -> 15062.60s]  I think I shot his gun and it fired and hit me in the face.
[15062.60s -> 15072.26s]  Un-fucking-believable.
[15072.26s -> 15078.79s]  Wrong button.
[15078.79s -> 15080.79s]  Playing with fire, playing with fire!
[15080.79s -> 15091.61s]  I'm trying to do fucking cool moves.
[15091.61s -> 15093.61s]  Alright, I'm done.
[15093.61s -> 15116.57s]  Fuck, that hurt.
[15116.57s -> 15136.58s]  We good?
[15136.58s -> 15144.50s]  I think so.
[15144.50s -> 15149.37s]  Good.
[15149.37s -> 15151.37s]  Somebody asked how long I've been streaming tonight.
[15151.37s -> 15157.37s]  So, for the next week or so, I'm gonna do a thing where I only stream for four amounts of time.
[15157.37s -> 15159.37s]  Beep.
[15159.37s -> 15161.74s]  Is that guy on the other side of the building?
[15161.74s -> 15166.34s]  Did I drop a grenade in the ground?
[15166.34s -> 15180.49s]  What an idiot.
[15180.49s -> 15193.10s]  It's never not gonna be funny.
[15197.88s -> 15200.44s]  Okay, he's gone.
[15200.44s -> 15203.83s]  But anyways,
[15203.83s -> 15206.14s]  I'm trying to spread out the streams this week.
[15206.14s -> 15212.14s]  To do more streams, but less time on the streams.
[15212.14s -> 15214.14s]  If that makes any sense.
[15214.14s -> 15224.36s]  It should.
[15224.36s -> 15226.36s]  Like five hours?
[15226.36s -> 15228.36s]  Yes, it really depends.
[15228.36s -> 15234.36s]  Because, for anyone that wasn't here an hour or two ago, or the couple when I started talking about it in the first place,
[15234.36s -> 15238.36s]  I'm on a couple of new medications for my stomach that...
[15238.36s -> 15244.70s]  Hold on, this is important.
[15244.70s -> 15246.70s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[15271.50s -> 15273.50s]  I mean, I could be...
[15273.50s -> 15275.50s]  Whatever, I could just tell you.
[15275.50s -> 15277.86s]  It's not like I'm embarrassed by it.
[15277.86s -> 15281.64s]  Who cares?
[15281.64s -> 15284.58s]  Oh, hold on.
[15284.58s -> 15286.58s]  He hasn't told us.
[15286.58s -> 15289.91s]  No, I haven't.
[15289.91s -> 15293.75s]  I have not. You're right, I haven't.
[15293.75s -> 15296.95s]  What is it?
[15296.95s -> 15298.95s]  Well, I'll let you deduce that for yourselves.
[15298.95s -> 15301.58s]  What would I be on that would...
[15301.58s -> 15304.71s]  Oh, hold on.
[15304.71s -> 15306.71s]  I don't know, I want...
[15306.71s -> 15308.71s]  Ah, the sniper rifle's fun though.
[15308.71s -> 15312.71s]  I'm on a certain medication that requires me to do something.
[15312.71s -> 15316.71s]  A few times a day.
[15316.71s -> 15320.71s]  And it's a strong medication that has a specific purpose.
[15320.71s -> 15330.60s]  And it's just causing me some stomach upset, discomfort, and...
[15330.60s -> 15336.03s]  I can't really be in the same place for more than four or five hours, really.
[15336.03s -> 15338.34s]  No, I'm not doing cocaine.
[15338.34s -> 15346.91s]  But I'm on two new medications.
[15346.91s -> 15348.91s]  That's one of them.
[15348.91s -> 15353.41s]  And the other one is kind of working together with it.
[15353.41s -> 15357.71s]  So, there will be more streams, but not as long.
[15357.71s -> 15361.66s]  This week.
[15361.66s -> 15363.97s]  Cocaine is one of them.
[15363.97s -> 15365.97s]  So you can't clip it.
[15365.97s -> 15369.42s]  Whatever, who cares?
[15369.42s -> 15372.11s]  Where am I supposed to go? Rejoin?
[15372.11s -> 15378.51s]  The Holiday Bishop on the roof.
[15378.51s -> 15382.74s]  Isn't that where we are?
[15382.74s -> 15390.10s]  I'm on the roof, let's go!
[15390.10s -> 15399.57s]  The other roof.
[15399.57s -> 15401.57s]  There is no other roof, there's only one roof.
[15401.57s -> 15404.90s]  I mean, I guess I have to go through here?
[15404.90s -> 15407.76s]  Did I just miss a door?
[15407.76s -> 15420.75s]  Yeah, it looks like I did.
[15420.75s -> 15424.98s]  I just wrapped around.
[15424.98s -> 15428.50s]  Nope.
[15428.50s -> 15431.57s]  Fuck.
[15431.57s -> 15433.57s]  Okay, I killed it.
[15433.57s -> 15435.57s]  I killed it, I'm sorry.
[15435.57s -> 15437.57s]  He died instantly.
[15437.57s -> 15439.57s]  I really am so sorry.
[15439.57s -> 15442.19s]  He's just trying to tell the news.
[15442.19s -> 15453.57s]  We're good.
[15453.57s -> 15455.57s]  I'm going to pick up, I'm taking the sniper rifle.
[15455.57s -> 15458.06s]  I feel like why would they keep showing it to me?
[15458.06s -> 15463.31s]  You're leaving without me.
[15463.31s -> 15465.31s]  You're leaving without me!
[15465.31s -> 15467.31s]  Say it!
[15467.31s -> 15475.12s]  Oh, he's gone.
[15475.12s -> 15478.83s]  That was quick, alright.
[15478.83s -> 15499.23s]  What's going on with this guy's body?
[15499.23s -> 15501.23s]  I mean, he was being a little strange.
[15501.23s -> 15505.01s]  He was being a little strange.
[15511.94s -> 15514.94s]  I thought it was him!
[15514.94s -> 15516.94s]  I thought it was the guy flying off the...
[15516.94s -> 15543.68s]  I thought it was the guy flying off the...
[15543.68s -> 15545.68s]  I thought it was the guy flying off the...
[15545.68s -> 15548.30s]  I thought it was the guy flying off the...
[15548.30s -> 15550.30s]  They had the same kind of
[15550.30s -> 15552.30s]  cadence and tone.
[15552.30s -> 15557.36s]  Ugh.
[15557.36s -> 15559.36s]  Okay, again.
[15559.36s -> 15561.36s]  That's a lot of money though.
[15561.36s -> 15564.56s]  Hold on.
[15564.56s -> 15572.99s]  Goodbye.
[15572.99s -> 15574.99s]  Somebody give a hundred dollars.
[15574.99s -> 15576.99s]  Ten thousand bits, hold on.
[15576.99s -> 15578.99s]  He didn't feel very friendly to me.
[15578.99s -> 15580.99s]  I think that they were deliberately targeting me.
[15580.99s -> 15584.06s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[15584.06s -> 15595.46s]  He's like
[15595.46s -> 15597.46s]  flying in a circle.
[15597.46s -> 15599.46s]  Ugh.
[15599.46s -> 15601.46s]  One of his colleagues.
[15601.46s -> 15604.02s]  What the fuck are we doing?
[15604.02s -> 15606.02s]  Who is this? This is the shoulder guy.
[15606.02s -> 15612.21s]  Ugh.
[15612.21s -> 15614.21s]  This game is really, really fun.
[15614.21s -> 15618.48s]  This has been
[15618.48s -> 15628.85s]  just very fun.
[15628.85s -> 15632.05s]  He's over here!
[15632.05s -> 15634.74s]  What the fuck?
[15634.74s -> 15636.74s]  How did you get me that quickly?
[15636.74s -> 15638.74s]  PumpkinSmasher68
[15638.74s -> 15640.74s]  gave ten thousand bits.
[15640.74s -> 15642.74s]  That's one hundred bucks in bits. That's a shitload of money.
[15642.74s -> 15644.74s]  Thank you, Pumpkin.
[15644.74s -> 15646.74s]  I hope this makes your day better.
[15649.36s -> 15651.36s]  It's a hundred dollars.
[15651.36s -> 15653.36s]  That's a shitload of money.
[15653.36s -> 15655.36s]  I mean, thank you.
[15655.36s -> 15659.46s]  Why are they not shooting me?
[15659.46s -> 15669.50s]  He's over here!
[15669.50s -> 15671.87s]  What the fuck is ATC doing?
[15671.87s -> 15673.87s]  Thanks a lot, PumpkinSmasher.
[15673.87s -> 15675.87s]  Seriously.
[15675.87s -> 15677.87s]  You made my day really good.
[15677.87s -> 15679.87s]  Thank you.
[15679.87s -> 15681.87s]  I'm gonna buy a fucking large
[15681.87s -> 15683.87s]  pizza with that. Why would this guy die?
[15683.87s -> 15688.22s]  Feels pumpkin, man.
[15688.22s -> 15691.02s]  Thank you.
[15691.02s -> 15693.39s]  It's quiet. This is my opportunity.
[15693.39s -> 15695.39s]  This is my chance. Okay, they come
[15695.39s -> 15700.19s]  through this door.
[15700.19s -> 15703.46s]  That's as far as you can throw that.
[15703.46s -> 15705.46s]  That's unbelievably pathetic.
[15705.46s -> 15714.78s]  That's ridiculous. I could
[15714.78s -> 15724.96s]  throw that shit over that roof.
[15728.96s -> 15743.30s]  Where's the other one?
[15743.30s -> 15745.60s]  Where's the other one?
[15745.60s -> 15748.54s]  Wasn't there two?
[15748.54s -> 15750.54s]  Wasn't there a second person?
[15750.54s -> 15781.01s]  I can't!
[15781.01s -> 15783.01s]  Okay, I need to pay attention.
[15783.01s -> 15785.01s]  It's too fun to just...
[15785.01s -> 15789.79s]  Okay.
[15814.02s -> 15816.26s]  No!
[15816.26s -> 15836.74s]  Just do it!
[15836.74s -> 15845.63s]  You don't have to get close!
[15845.63s -> 15847.63s]  I'm getting too close!
[15847.63s -> 15849.63s]  I don't know why I'm doing that!
[15849.63s -> 15851.63s]  Why am I getting so close to everybody?
[15851.63s -> 15853.63s]  I was doing fine!
[15853.63s -> 15855.63s]  I wanted to get over there
[15855.63s -> 15857.63s]  and I don't know what I was thinking.
[15857.63s -> 15873.10s]  Okay, I'm done.
[15873.10s -> 15875.10s]  I'm ready.
[15898.36s -> 15960.49s]  Out of here!
[15960.49s -> 15962.92s]  I wanted to watch him go!
[15962.92s -> 15970.34s]  Okay, that wasn't on fucking purpose.
[15970.34s -> 15972.34s]  Fuck. Everyone's going to think that I did that on
[15972.34s -> 15974.34s]  fucking purpose and I did, but I didn't.
[15974.34s -> 15976.58s]  I did, but I didn't.
[15976.58s -> 15978.58s]  You understand? I did, but I didn't.
[15978.58s -> 15980.58s]  I wanted to do a final look to...
[15980.58s -> 15982.58s]  I did, but I didn't. And that was not...
[15982.58s -> 15990.78s]  It was, but it wasn't. You understand?
[15990.78s -> 15992.78s]  I swear I've not tried to do this
[15992.78s -> 15994.78s]  this many times.
[16013.28s -> 16018.40s]  Who the fuck are you?
[16018.40s -> 16027.60s]  He's here!
[16027.60s -> 16031.49s]  How close are you?
[16031.49s -> 16033.49s]  He's trying to flank!
[16033.49s -> 16035.49s]  What? No, I'm not! I'm trying to...
[16035.49s -> 16043.17s]  Where is this person? Oh, right there.
[16043.17s -> 16052.50s]  Are they dead? Oh, fuck.
[16052.50s -> 16059.28s]  I thought that was a face.
[16059.28s -> 16081.79s]  You're not alive!
[16081.79s -> 16083.79s]  Has been neutralized. Flashlight!
[16083.79s -> 16087.82s]  Good work! He's over here!
[16091.41s -> 16096.59s]  These guys...
[16096.59s -> 16098.59s]  It's so dangerous. This shit is
[16098.59s -> 16101.15s]  so powerful. I have no more healing.
[16113.10s -> 16132.62s]  Good. That's what I want.
[16132.62s -> 16135.95s]  He's over here!
[16137.95s -> 16143.71s]  Close the fucking door!
[16143.71s -> 16165.09s]  Alright, give me that. Give me that shit.
[16165.09s -> 16173.26s]  Go down. Why can I not go over here?
[16173.26s -> 16182.14s]  How the hell do I get out?
[16182.14s -> 16190.70s]  Uh oh. I'm good. Okay, let's go.
[16190.70s -> 16192.70s]  There's no Half-Life crouch jump?
[16192.70s -> 16194.70s]  I know what the fuck is going on there.
[16194.70s -> 16197.65s]  One health pack.
[16197.65s -> 16200.02s]  This is around the corner here. Alright.
[16200.02s -> 16221.90s]  I can go the other way.
[16221.90s -> 16224.14s]  Good health. Nice.
[16224.14s -> 16226.14s]  They do put it everywhere though, so that's good.
[16226.14s -> 16236.50s]  We're up here.
[16236.50s -> 16238.50s]  Snipers. That's why, because they had sniper rifles.
[16238.50s -> 16241.44s]  Damn. Okay.
[16241.44s -> 16244.64s]  I got ammo for it.
[16244.64s -> 16246.64s]  Might as well use it.
[16246.64s -> 16257.84s]  Watch out! Grenade!
[16257.84s -> 16265.25s]  How would you see that?
[16265.25s -> 16268.90s]  I don't think they got out. How would you know
[16268.90s -> 16271.20s]  that was a grenade? You just, you wouldn't.
[16271.20s -> 16284.13s]  Oh, music. What does that mean?
[16284.13s -> 16291.10s]  Alright, refilling all the health. That's good.
[16291.10s -> 16293.10s]  Flashlight. What?
[16293.10s -> 16300.32s]  Get down!
[16300.32s -> 16302.32s]  The fuck just happened?
[16302.32s -> 16304.32s]  It went like anti-gravity.
[16304.32s -> 16307.07s]  What? What happened?
[16307.07s -> 16326.19s]  What the fuck?
[16326.19s -> 16328.19s]  Okay, I'm fine.
[16328.19s -> 16330.19s]  Oh, what the, what the fuck?
[16330.19s -> 16343.31s]  What the fuck?
[16343.31s -> 16345.31s]  Find a way back up to the main building. Oh, you bastard.
[16345.31s -> 16347.55s]  Really?
[16347.55s -> 16369.70s]  You gonna do this shit to me right now?
[16369.70s -> 16378.13s]  Uh, okay.
[16378.13s -> 16380.13s]  I guess I'm going over, oh.
[16380.13s -> 16382.62s]  Ooh. Alright.
[16382.62s -> 16386.21s]  I'll take it. Thank you.
[16386.21s -> 16389.60s]  Now we gotta go, uh,
[16389.60s -> 16394.08s]  up there,
[16394.08s -> 16396.96s]  somehow.
[16396.96s -> 16398.96s]  Or under. Wait, there we go.
[16398.96s -> 16402.85s]  Alright, what's, what's going on here?
[16402.85s -> 16404.85s]  There's like a giant animal in there.
[16404.85s -> 16407.66s]  Shotgun time. Mine's screwing around here.
[16407.66s -> 16410.35s]  What is that?
[16410.35s -> 16413.87s]  I thought that was a,
[16413.87s -> 16423.14s]  it's alright.
[16423.14s -> 16425.14s]  Uh, I need to get that health back.
[16425.14s -> 16427.89s]  Can I reach the wall?
[16427.89s -> 16444.72s]  Let me, let me exploit this.
[16444.72s -> 16448.18s]  I can't get up there.
[16448.18s -> 16450.18s]  What is going on right now? Why is the,
[16450.18s -> 16466.11s]  why is the world shaking?
[16466.11s -> 16470.27s]  I knew it was gonna fall.
[16470.27s -> 16474.24s]  I knew it.
[16474.24s -> 16476.24s]  And there ain't any other way to go, so I have to go around.
[16476.24s -> 16478.48s]  Can't make that jump.
[16478.48s -> 16487.44s]  So that leaves,
[16487.44s -> 16495.95s]  uh, over here.
[16495.95s -> 16501.01s]  I guess we're gonna try over here.
[16501.01s -> 16503.18s]  No, this is where I came in, so.
[16503.18s -> 16505.49s]  If I go this way,
[16505.49s -> 16507.49s]  that way is, okay,
[16507.49s -> 16509.49s]  over here. No, I, can I get up
[16509.49s -> 16540.06s]  that? Huh.
[16540.06s -> 16543.52s]  Can I do anything with that?
[16543.52s -> 16545.76s]  Just go forward?
[16545.76s -> 16548.64s]  I, I guess,
[16548.64s -> 16564.45s]  but I can't really go over here.
[16564.45s -> 16569.55s]  Wait, can I go?
[16569.55s -> 16572.43s]  Alright, I guess I'm going this way.
[16572.43s -> 16599.81s]  Oh shit, okay.
[16599.81s -> 16606.34s]  No, I can't go that way either.
[16606.34s -> 16615.02s]  Let's try over here.
[16615.02s -> 16626.10s]  He hates gaming. That may have just ended the stream.
[16626.10s -> 16642.99s]  I'm not gonna,
[16642.99s -> 16646.96s]  no, he didn't poop.
[16646.96s -> 16650.67s]  I'm starting to get, um,
[16650.67s -> 16653.62s]  a little queasy.
[16653.62s -> 16655.62s]  There's nothing to do with the game. It has to do with what's going on in my life right now.
[16655.62s -> 16657.62s]  So, um,
[16657.62s -> 16659.62s]  yeah,
[16659.62s -> 16663.52s]  on the next stopping point, I think I'll call it.
[16663.52s -> 16669.09s]  They left her in darkness.
[16669.09s -> 16671.09s]  That'll be just exactly where I wanted to stop anyways.
[16671.09s -> 16673.09s]  In about, like, five hours.
[16673.09s -> 16687.42s]  Yeah, I just got a good
[16687.42s -> 16689.42s]  checkpoint.
[16689.42s -> 16693.14s]  I don't wanna push it. Yeah, that's good.
[16693.14s -> 16696.00s]  That'll be good. We'll keep going tomorrow.
[16696.00s -> 16698.00s]  So again, for the next, like, four or five days,
[16698.00s -> 16700.00s]  we're gonna do
[16700.00s -> 16702.00s]  more days, but shorter streams.
[16702.00s -> 16704.69s]  Uh, plus I actually
[16704.69s -> 16707.06s]  have to go take
[16707.06s -> 16709.06s]  some of this medicine now.
[16709.06s -> 16712.00s]  And it's not gonna be fun.
[16712.00s -> 16714.00s]  But, I will see you guys tomorrow.
[16714.00s -> 16716.37s]  We'll call it there.
[16716.37s -> 16719.68s]  Oh, okay.
[16719.68s -> 16723.20s]  This is a lot of fun.
[16723.20s -> 16725.70s]  This was a blast. This game's great.
[16725.70s -> 16727.70s]  Anybody know how much is left?
[16727.70s -> 16730.13s]  What time tomorrow?
[16730.13s -> 16732.13s]  It's regular time, around one or two.
[16732.13s -> 16736.80s]  It's been about four and a half hours.
[16736.80s -> 16738.80s]  Four hours and forty minutes. Keep a couple hours.
[16738.80s -> 16742.19s]  Okay. This is about
[16742.19s -> 16745.58s]  three hours, four hours.
[16745.58s -> 16747.58s]  Forty-six hours. Alright, then that might be
[16747.58s -> 16751.10s]  a perfect time tomorrow. There's a lot
[16751.10s -> 16754.05s]  to play. We're just gonna spread it out.
[16754.05s -> 16756.05s]  So, thanks for coming. I'll see you guys
[16756.05s -> 16758.35s]  tomorrow. Let's get to the bits
[16758.35s -> 16760.35s]  and everything. We're gonna call it right there.
[16760.35s -> 16762.35s]  I'll just manually save it just in case.
[16762.35s -> 16767.60s]  And we'll see you tomorrow.
[16767.60s -> 16769.60s]  Oh, look. Top subgifter.
[16769.60s -> 16771.60s]  I wonder if they fixed this, cause Streamlabs
[16771.60s -> 16775.44s]  had an update. Let's check and see if they did.
[16775.44s -> 16786.82s]  Uh, let's
[16786.82s -> 16791.55s]  save game.
[16793.55s -> 16798.29s]  Oh, let me see.
[16798.29s -> 16800.29s]  Top subgifter, come on.
[16800.29s -> 16803.49s]  Session.
[16803.49s -> 16805.49s]  They just had an update.
[16805.49s -> 16807.49s]  Tell me they fixed it.
[16807.49s -> 16811.07s]  No!
[16811.07s -> 16817.14s]  Come on. It's not
[16817.14s -> 16819.14s]  me. This is the session.
[16819.14s -> 16821.14s]  I didn't do anything this session.
[16821.14s -> 16828.50s]  Session.
[16828.50s -> 16830.50s]  Let's put on a follower train.
[16830.50s -> 16839.89s]  But, see you tomorrow.
[16839.89s -> 16842.64s]  Oh, fuck.
[16842.64s -> 16845.76s]  I'm getting a little drained.
[16845.76s -> 16847.76s]  But I knew that was gonna happen. That's alright.
[16847.76s -> 16849.94s]  Anyhow,
[16849.94s -> 16851.94s]  let's go back.
[16851.94s -> 16859.98s]  About four hours ago.
[16859.98s -> 16862.61s]  It's rigged. Well, it's rigged to
[16862.61s -> 16866.45s]  reset.
[16866.45s -> 16868.45s]  But thank you Sturdy Bread for the 250. Hey, here's
[16868.45s -> 16870.45s]  some bits. I don't know what to put in these messages.
[16870.45s -> 16873.14s]  Thanks for being the best streamer around.
[16873.14s -> 16879.39s]  Thanks a lot. Glad you had fun.
[16879.39s -> 16881.39s]  Also, thank you Yes Is Online
[16881.39s -> 16884.59s]  for the 250.
[16884.59s -> 16886.59s]  They say, I wish I could fully watch the stream
[16886.59s -> 16888.59s]  today, but my glasses got absolutely destroyed
[16888.59s -> 16890.59s]  at the JPEG
[16890.59s -> 16892.59s]  Mafia show last night and I have to spend my
[16892.59s -> 16897.20s]  entire day blind.
[16897.20s -> 16899.20s]  Inside this Lenscrafters.
[16899.20s -> 16902.78s]  They say, good luck.
[16902.78s -> 16911.34s]  Thank you.
[16911.34s -> 16913.34s]  Thank you Jules for the 250.
[16913.34s -> 16915.34s]  Hey, Jerma, have you experienced anything paranormal
[16915.34s -> 16917.34s]  in your life? If not, will you be
[16917.34s -> 16919.34s]  visiting any haunted places in Vegas
[16919.34s -> 16921.34s]  this month? Does paranormal interest you?
[16921.34s -> 16923.34s]  Um, not at all.
[16923.34s -> 16926.22s]  We had a conversation
[16926.22s -> 16928.22s]  like a week or two ago about ghosts
[16928.22s -> 16930.22s]  and stuff and I don't really believe in the
[16930.22s -> 16932.22s]  term ghost in a
[16932.22s -> 16936.19s]  traditional sense.
[16936.19s -> 16938.19s]  Talked about how your great great great great great great
[16938.19s -> 16940.19s]  grandfather is like watching down and
[16940.19s -> 16942.19s]  walking around your house and eating
[16942.19s -> 16944.37s]  food out of your fridge.
[16944.37s -> 16946.37s]  It was a whole ordeal.
[16946.37s -> 16950.72s]  But I don't really believe in ghosts.
[16950.72s -> 16953.09s]  In the like,
[16953.09s -> 16955.46s]  I'm here
[16955.46s -> 16957.46s]  because
[16957.46s -> 16959.46s]  I have unfinished business
[16959.46s -> 16961.46s]  with you.
[16961.46s -> 16963.70s]  You screwed me out of the deal
[16963.70s -> 16965.70s]  and they literally won't leave your house like
[16965.70s -> 16967.70s]  Beetlejuice style. No, I don't I don't
[16967.70s -> 16977.23s]  think that's real.
[16977.23s -> 16979.23s]  Say Beetlejuice three times.
[16979.23s -> 16984.29s]  I will never do that.
[16984.29s -> 16987.68s]  That's what a ghost would say.
[16987.68s -> 16989.68s]  Look, but I can't prove that they don't exist
[16989.68s -> 16991.98s]  either, right?
[16991.98s -> 16993.98s]  I can't tell you guys.
[16993.98s -> 16995.98s]  We see a certain
[16995.98s -> 16998.74s]  spectrum of colors.
[16998.74s -> 17000.74s]  Who knows? There might be a whole other spectrum of light
[17000.74s -> 17002.74s]  that we can't see.
[17002.74s -> 17004.74s]  That's not like infrared. It might be something completely
[17004.74s -> 17006.74s]  different. There might be a whole world underneath
[17006.74s -> 17008.74s]  our world. I don't know. You can't see it.
[17008.74s -> 17019.42s]  I have no idea. Do I believe in aliens?
[17019.42s -> 17023.50s]  Um,
[17023.50s -> 17026.06s]  yeah, probably.
[17026.06s -> 17029.26s]  If there's 500 billion galaxies,
[17029.26s -> 17031.26s]  one of them is going to have a Starbucks
[17031.26s -> 17033.63s]  somewhere. There'll be something.
[17033.63s -> 17035.87s]  I mean, I don't think we'll ever, ever,
[17035.87s -> 17037.87s]  ever, ever talk to them.
[17037.87s -> 17051.36s]  We'll never see them, ever.
[17051.36s -> 17055.97s]  I don't know. Do you understand how
[17055.97s -> 17057.97s]  fucked up this whole world is? Like, the giraffe exists.
[17057.97s -> 17061.04s]  Nobody can
[17061.04s -> 17063.04s]  tell you anything. Nobody can explain
[17063.04s -> 17074.30s]  shit. You have
[17074.30s -> 17076.86s]  a series of tubes in your body
[17076.86s -> 17078.86s]  that carry a
[17078.86s -> 17080.86s]  substance around your whole body
[17080.86s -> 17085.60s]  to make sure you stay alive.
[17085.60s -> 17094.48s]  Huh? Electricity
[17094.48s -> 17096.48s]  is a thing. Like lightning strikes
[17096.48s -> 17099.68s]  from the sky. We're just
[17099.68s -> 17101.68s]  making our best guesses, guys.
[17101.68s -> 17103.68s]  It don't matter who you are.
[17103.68s -> 17108.35s]  Can you imagine trying to fucking
[17108.35s -> 17110.78s]  explain what the hell that is?
[17110.78s -> 17112.78s]  Boom! Lightning!
[17112.78s -> 17114.78s]  I have no
[17114.78s -> 17116.78s]  fucking idea what that was.
[17116.78s -> 17118.78s]  I guess we'll try to think what it
[17118.78s -> 17120.78s]  could... We'll figure it out, I guess.
[17120.78s -> 17125.26s]  Science can prove how it works, but science
[17125.26s -> 17127.26s]  can't prove, like,
[17127.26s -> 17129.44s]  why it doesn't... Why?
[17129.44s -> 17131.74s]  Why is it lightning?
[17131.74s -> 17133.74s]  Why do we have veins? Like, why did this happen?
[17133.74s -> 17135.74s]  What the fuck was this for?
[17135.74s -> 17145.09s]  It's called electric... I know what
[17145.09s -> 17147.58s]  electricity is, I'm just saying.
[17147.58s -> 17150.59s]  What? What? What?
[17150.59s -> 17152.59s]  You put gasoline in your car and you can drive
[17152.59s -> 17154.59s]  down the road. That... Why?
[17154.59s -> 17156.59s]  How did we get that far? You have a
[17156.59s -> 17160.43s]  flat-screen TV in your house. You're telling me
[17160.43s -> 17162.43s]  two to three hundred years ago, people would
[17162.43s -> 17164.43s]  fucking ride around in horse and
[17164.43s -> 17166.67s]  buggies? And you have an iPhone
[17166.67s -> 17174.86s]  in your pocket now? Maybe I do believe
[17174.86s -> 17176.86s]  in aliens. They fucking landed and they gave us
[17176.86s -> 17181.41s]  all the goddamn technology.
[17181.41s -> 17183.41s]  Imagine not knowing what thermodynamics
[17183.41s -> 17185.41s]  works. How... Thermodynamics
[17185.41s -> 17187.41s]  was a word that was made up to explain
[17187.41s -> 17194.77s]  what thermodynamics is.
[17194.77s -> 17200.46s]  It's all language.
[17200.46s -> 17211.65s]  But an eye-opening
[17211.65s -> 17221.44s]  string. Time isn't
[17221.44s -> 17224.32s]  real. Yeah, I guess
[17224.32s -> 17226.32s]  time is a concept that
[17226.32s -> 17228.32s]  we created to try to explain
[17228.32s -> 17230.32s]  why the sun goes up and down.
[17230.32s -> 17234.22s]  Two hundred IQ?
[17234.22s -> 17238.83s]  I tell you, sometimes it's
[17238.83s -> 17250.42s]  too easy. Can I tell you,
[17250.42s -> 17253.10s]  one of my favorite things
[17253.10s -> 17255.10s]  is verbal shitposting at the beginning
[17255.10s -> 17257.10s]  and the end of my streams.
[17257.10s -> 17259.10s]  It's so fun.
[17259.10s -> 17261.10s]  Now I get it. I know why you guys do it.
[17261.10s -> 17266.42s]  That's one of my favorite things in the world.
[17266.42s -> 17279.20s]  He understands.
[17279.20s -> 17281.20s]  You're always doing that. I don't
[17281.20s -> 17283.20s]  know. It's fun. It's fun just to
[17283.20s -> 17287.74s]  talk about random things.
[17287.74s -> 17293.95s]  Dad gets me. Mouth
[17293.95s -> 17301.89s]  diarrhea. Yeah.
[17301.89s -> 17303.89s]  Who's your favorite?
[17303.89s -> 17317.26s]  What's your favorite pantheon?
[17317.26s -> 17319.44s]  Norse. Norse. Greek.
[17319.44s -> 17322.13s]  Greek. Roman.
[17322.13s -> 17334.72s]  Are we going to get a smite stream? I'm
[17334.72s -> 17336.72s]  dumb and don't know what you mean.
[17336.72s -> 17341.01s]  Gods. Gods. Yeah, you do. They're all cool.
[17341.01s -> 17343.89s]  That's how people
[17343.89s -> 17346.90s]  explain the world.
[17346.90s -> 17348.90s]  Can you imagine if in
[17348.90s -> 17350.90s]  a thousand years they're looking back at us
[17350.90s -> 17352.90s]  talking about string theory and they're
[17352.90s -> 17354.90s]  laughing because it's as ridiculous
[17354.90s -> 17364.69s]  as Zeus?
[17364.69s -> 17371.22s]  They didn't know.
[17371.22s -> 17373.65s]  It's funny now.
[17373.65s -> 17375.65s]  All right. Hold on.
[17375.65s -> 17378.34s]  I don't want to turn a end of
[17378.34s -> 17380.34s]  the stream shitpost into a let's debate
[17380.34s -> 17385.71s]  science for real.
[17385.71s -> 17387.71s]  Anyways, I don't know how it got there. Somebody
[17387.71s -> 17392.45s]  said something. But anyways,
[17392.45s -> 17397.38s]  let's go. Let's do it for real.
[17397.38s -> 17399.38s]  Lizard Amiibo, thanks
[17399.38s -> 17401.38s]  for the 500 bits. Hey, Jerma, I just started my
[17401.38s -> 17403.38s]  first year of college and so far it's been pretty
[17403.38s -> 17405.38s]  rough. The streams and videos are
[17405.38s -> 17407.38s]  one of the things that have been able to make me smile.
[17407.38s -> 17409.38s]  The time, effort,
[17409.38s -> 17411.38s]  and why is this cut off?
[17411.38s -> 17417.06s]  Streamlabs, I'm telling
[17417.06s -> 17419.06s]  you. You got, you made
[17419.06s -> 17421.06s]  this new update.
[17421.06s -> 17423.55s]  But
[17423.55s -> 17426.43s]  you're cutting off everything now.
[17426.43s -> 17428.43s]  Why are you cutting everything off?
[17428.43s -> 17430.93s]  This is this new
[17430.93s -> 17433.23s]  mini feed.
[17433.23s -> 17435.23s]  Not good. I'm not happy with this.
[17435.23s -> 17439.57s]  Huh. Mini feed
[17439.57s -> 17441.57s]  cuts off everything. How do I just make it the regular
[17441.57s -> 17444.00s]  feed? What have we done?
[17444.00s -> 17452.18s]  Hold on. I
[17452.18s -> 17455.12s]  think, I think, I think
[17455.12s -> 17457.12s]  I think I'm going to dump Streamlabs
[17457.12s -> 17460.32s]  OBS. Yeah,
[17460.32s -> 17462.32s]  not, not doing
[17462.32s -> 17467.44s]  it for me. Not doing
[17467.44s -> 17469.44s]  it for me at all actually.
[17469.44s -> 17479.14s]  Go here. Good.
[17479.14s -> 17481.14s]  It's a bunch of great, interesting
[17481.14s -> 17483.14s]  ideas that all of them just kind of don't
[17483.14s -> 17485.14s]  work at the same time together.
[17485.14s -> 17490.13s]  I'm going to, I'm just going to go back to the regular
[17490.13s -> 17492.13s]  Streamlabs. Not Streamlabs, regular OBS.
[17492.13s -> 17494.69s]  Apparently it's some really
[17494.69s -> 17496.69s]  cool features that they added.
[17496.69s -> 17509.23s]  OBS vanilla flavor, yes.
[17509.23s -> 17515.70s]  Logitech bought Streamlabs.
[17515.70s -> 17520.82s]  That's kind
[17520.82s -> 17524.14s]  of interesting I guess, yeah.
[17524.14s -> 17529.97s]  That's kind of interesting. That explains
[17529.97s -> 17533.49s]  a lot, does it? They're just trying
[17533.49s -> 17535.49s]  to load too much in the same place and then
[17535.49s -> 17537.73s]  I don't know. I could
[17537.73s -> 17539.73s]  talk about how I don't like it but it's
[17539.73s -> 17541.73s]  fine. Just don't use it.
[17541.73s -> 17543.73s]  It's that simple. Anyways, alright,
[17543.73s -> 17546.16s]  let's go back to what we were doing.
[17546.16s -> 17548.16s]  We had, we had five community
[17548.16s -> 17550.16s]  subs from Snooze and Copter at the very beginning
[17550.16s -> 17557.07s]  of the stream. We also had
[17557.07s -> 17559.07s]  Cyclops Parker
[17559.07s -> 17564.06s]  gave ten community subs
[17564.06s -> 17566.06s]  three, four hours ago here. Thanks to the ten community
[17566.06s -> 17570.86s]  subs. Also Zake,
[17570.86s -> 17572.86s]  this is where we left off here. Zake, thanks for the 250. Hey
[17572.86s -> 17574.86s]  man, thanks for providing a nice distraction from student
[17574.86s -> 17576.86s]  stress. How are you? Are you enjoying
[17576.86s -> 17578.86s]  streaming? Cheers from
[17578.86s -> 17580.86s]  5,390 miles away.
[17580.86s -> 17584.19s]  I love streaming. Streaming's like one of my
[17584.19s -> 17588.80s]  favorite things ever. I would say
[17588.80s -> 17595.33s]  streaming is, it's
[17595.33s -> 17597.33s]  one of my main focuses of my
[17597.33s -> 17603.47s]  whole life. So greetings from
[17603.47s -> 17605.47s]  5,400 miles away.
[17605.47s -> 17607.47s]  That's really far, I wonder
[17607.47s -> 17612.27s]  where is that? I missed two hundred dollars
[17612.27s -> 17614.45s]  right now? Oh
[17614.45s -> 17616.45s]  earlier, okay, yeah. It was from
[17616.45s -> 17618.45s]  Vilemi. Two hundred dollars
[17618.45s -> 17620.45s]  twenty thousand bits
[17620.45s -> 17623.01s]  from about
[17623.01s -> 17625.18s]  five minutes ago or so
[17625.18s -> 17627.81s]  we were talking about like
[17627.81s -> 17629.81s]  the blood vessels in your body and how that means
[17629.81s -> 17631.81s]  that like aliens landed. I don't know.
[17631.81s -> 17633.81s]  A bunch of people left and probably thought I was like actually
[17633.81s -> 17636.43s]  a fucking weirdo. Oh, whatever.
[17636.43s -> 17638.67s]  That's okay. Thanks
[17638.67s -> 17640.67s]  for the 200 bucks though. That's a lot of money, Vilemi.
[17640.67s -> 17642.67s]  It's a shitload of money.
[17642.67s -> 17645.87s]  At the same time, just to dump
[17645.87s -> 17647.87s]  two hundred twenty thousand bits.
[17647.87s -> 17650.69s]  True.
[17650.69s -> 17656.64s]  But Vilemi, fuck yeah, that's a lot of
[17656.64s -> 17659.01s]  money. And they say germ
[17659.01s -> 17661.50s]  A-W-O-O
[17661.50s -> 17663.50s]  Germ-O-Woo
[17663.50s -> 17665.81s]  I'm re- I'm reading it!
[17665.81s -> 17671.89s]  Tell us when the next carnival's gonna be. There's not gonna be
[17671.89s -> 17673.89s]  a carnival with it but you stream on the 31st
[17673.89s -> 17675.89s]  or at least on the 30th or 31st.
[17675.89s -> 17678.13s]  Doing a Halloween stream
[17678.13s -> 17680.13s]  that's gonna have a lot of intricate details to it so
[17680.13s -> 17682.13s]  go check out the Discord. There's a couple
[17682.13s -> 17684.50s]  channels there. Go read the pin messages
[17684.50s -> 17688.53s]  and you'll know what's gonna happen.
[17688.53s -> 17691.86s]  But thanks a lot, Vilemi. That brings us back
[17691.86s -> 17697.74s]  down. Let's go back down to
[17697.74s -> 17704.34s]  right down here. But Lizard Amiibo,
[17704.34s -> 17706.34s]  thank you. Sorry to hear that your first
[17706.34s -> 17708.34s]  year of college is rough.
[17708.34s -> 17710.34s]  It can happen like that though.
[17710.34s -> 17713.02s]  The first year or so
[17713.02s -> 17715.02s]  is very nerve wracking for everybody.
[17715.02s -> 17717.39s]  So you kind of just need to
[17717.39s -> 17719.39s]  keep going, try to
[17719.39s -> 17721.39s]  make some friends, and try to make
[17721.39s -> 17723.39s]  the best of your college experience.
[17723.39s -> 17729.90s]  It can be a lot of fun. Just make sure you
[17729.90s -> 17731.90s]  are taking care of your work, taking care of your
[17731.90s -> 17733.90s]  life. It can be a good time.
[17733.90s -> 17737.23s]  But the first year always is
[17737.23s -> 17739.54s]  a big kind of
[17739.54s -> 17741.54s]  shock for a lot of people.
[17741.54s -> 17745.12s]  But you'll shake off the cobwebs.
[17745.12s -> 17750.67s]  I wish you the best of luck. Thank you
[17750.67s -> 17752.67s]  Snooze for the 250. Hey Germ, I just want to say that your streams
[17752.67s -> 17754.67s]  have always cheered me up and made me laugh.
[17754.67s -> 17756.67s]  You are genuinely kind and humble.
[17756.67s -> 17758.85s]  It inspires me to be the same way.
[17758.85s -> 17760.85s]  Anyways, enough being cheesy, I made some
[17760.85s -> 17762.85s]  fan art for you recently. I can't wait for the next
[17762.85s -> 17764.85s]  Community Content Night so you can
[17764.85s -> 17767.98s]  see it. Goodnight. Yeah?
[17767.98s -> 17771.36s]  Toss it in there.
[17771.36s -> 17773.36s]  The next time we do it, I'm sure it'll be there.
[17773.36s -> 17777.71s]  I appreciate the incredibly kind messages
[17777.71s -> 17785.25s]  though. Thank you Snooze.
[17785.25s -> 17787.25s]  And speaking of Community Content Night, I'm going to be
[17787.25s -> 17790.19s]  adding much more
[17790.19s -> 17792.19s]  material to pull from for you guys
[17792.19s -> 17795.90s]  that make videos. I will say it again,
[17795.90s -> 17797.90s]  I've said it the last few streams in a row.
[17797.90s -> 17799.90s]  I'm going back in front of the green
[17799.90s -> 17801.90s]  screen for a whole stream.
[17801.90s -> 17803.90s]  We're going to do a whole other thing where
[17803.90s -> 17805.90s]  we pull a ton of suggestions
[17805.90s -> 17807.90s]  and we do green screen DLC
[17807.90s -> 17809.90s]  for free.
[17809.90s -> 17811.90s]  That's the title of the stream. I've got it
[17811.90s -> 17813.90s]  already like a month and a half in advance.
[17813.90s -> 17820.82s]  I already know that's what the title is.
[17820.82s -> 17822.82s]  Hey Lude Sheep, thanks for the 300 bits. Hey
[17822.82s -> 17824.82s]  Germ, we just want to say hello from all of us at the Sprio
[17824.82s -> 17827.63s]  Discord channel. Hello from
[17827.63s -> 17829.63s]  there. Nice to see you.
[17829.63s -> 17831.87s]  They say, oh and
[17831.87s -> 17833.87s]  Postposs says
[17833.87s -> 17836.30s]  hey as well. Postposs
[17836.30s -> 17842.38s]  one. Hi guys.
[17842.38s -> 17844.38s]  Thank you Lude Sheep. And hello
[17844.38s -> 17846.38s]  everybody at that Discord. Whoever you are.
[17846.38s -> 17849.78s]  Wherever you are. Thank you.
[17849.78s -> 17853.17s]  Sir Canine, thanks for the 250. Louis Anderson
[17853.17s -> 17855.17s]  Human Garfield is probably one of the most terrifying
[17855.17s -> 17859.07s]  creations in human history.
[17859.07s -> 17861.07s]  What happened to that guy? That guy just kind of disappeared.
[17861.07s -> 17865.23s]  I wanted more of the
[17865.23s -> 17867.23s]  Grenade Eater. But we're not going to
[17867.23s -> 17872.74s]  get it. Hey Shiggy, thanks for the
[17872.74s -> 17877.66s]  250.
[17877.66s -> 17879.66s]  Hey Germ, I wonder if you consider yourself a
[17879.66s -> 17882.67s]  what is this? What is this word?
[17882.67s -> 17886.70s]  What do you have to say about the fans
[17886.70s -> 17889.07s]  proclaiming you are a model
[17889.07s -> 17897.65s]  H? What is this?
[17897.65s -> 17899.65s]  Yeah, what is that? What does it
[17899.65s -> 17913.98s]  mean? It means
[17913.98s -> 17917.38s]  stupid but handsome.
[17917.38s -> 17919.38s]  Well those people are the ones that stuck around for
[17919.38s -> 17921.38s]  the post stream.
[17921.38s -> 17923.38s]  There are tubes in your body. Rant.
[17923.38s -> 17925.38s]  And then they left.
[17925.38s -> 17927.38s]  And that's the only piece of the content they watched. They missed the part
[17927.38s -> 17930.45s]  when I talked about the
[17930.45s -> 17941.01s]  Well, whatever.
[17941.01s -> 17943.63s]  Himbo.
[17943.63s -> 17945.63s]  Okay, I don't
[17945.63s -> 17949.09s]  What do I have to say about that?
[17949.09s -> 17956.00s]  I got a degree. I went to engineering
[17956.00s -> 17965.66s]  school. I was a waiter
[17965.66s -> 17967.66s]  for three years.
[17967.66s -> 17971.89s]  What are the more made up
[17971.89s -> 17973.89s]  things around the wiki page?
[17973.89s -> 17982.14s]  I wonder. Why don't you look at chat during
[17982.14s -> 17984.90s]  the stream? I look at chat
[17984.90s -> 17986.90s]  so much during the stream that it makes me step in bear traps.
[17986.90s -> 17988.90s]  500 times.
[17988.90s -> 18001.18s]  I'm just speaking in reality.
[18001.18s -> 18006.62s]  That's a nice excuse.
[18006.62s -> 18008.62s]  It is a pretty good excuse.
[18008.62s -> 18010.62s]  I mean it's surely, absolutely
[18010.62s -> 18012.62s]  an excuse but it's a pretty good one.
[18012.62s -> 18016.78s]  Hey Warm Like Biscuits, thanks for the
[18016.78s -> 18018.78s]  500 bits.
[18018.78s -> 18020.78s]  I've been watching you since your early YouTube days.
[18020.78s -> 18022.78s]  Thank you for all the laughs. You've pulled me out of some
[18022.78s -> 18024.78s]  dark places. Here's a little bit of gratitude
[18024.78s -> 18027.86s]  so thank you. Thank you
[18027.86s -> 18029.86s]  Warm Like Biscuits.
[18029.86s -> 18038.99s]  I'm glad you can laugh.
[18038.99s -> 18040.99s]  I love laughing. It's one of my favorite things in the world.
[18040.99s -> 18043.94s]  Hey guess what?
[18043.94s -> 18046.56s]  Laughing at shit has
[18046.56s -> 18048.56s]  pulled me out of some places that I never
[18048.56s -> 18051.38s]  really wanted to be in over the
[18051.38s -> 18054.83s]  course of my life. I think it's so
[18054.83s -> 18056.83s]  important. I think
[18056.83s -> 18058.83s]  laughing and having a good time.
[18058.83s -> 18060.83s]  Jokes. I think comedy
[18060.83s -> 18062.83s]  is one of the most important things.
[18062.83s -> 18065.26s]  If you can pull comedy out of any
[18065.26s -> 18067.26s]  situation or situations
[18067.26s -> 18070.64s]  and everybody can laugh
[18070.64s -> 18076.98s]  I think it's incredibly important.
[18076.98s -> 18079.66s]  It's the best medicine. Well it's a good
[18079.66s -> 18082.54s]  supplement. It's a good supplement to medicine.
[18082.54s -> 18085.87s]  I'd probably say that's more accurate.
[18085.87s -> 18094.06s]  We're talking comedy here.
[18094.06s -> 18097.84s]  Yeah I think it's
[18097.84s -> 18099.84s]  a very important thing so
[18099.84s -> 18101.84s]  if anybody gets that out of this stream then that makes me
[18101.84s -> 18103.84s]  really happy because that's obviously
[18103.84s -> 18105.84s]  I find that to be something that I care so much about
[18105.84s -> 18108.34s]  in my life. So I'm
[18108.34s -> 18110.34s]  glad it translates to a lot of you.
[18110.34s -> 18112.51s]  That makes me really happy.
[18112.51s -> 18119.22s]  Thanks a lot. Hey Sad Vega
[18119.22s -> 18121.22s]  thanks for the 250.
[18121.22s -> 18123.22s]  Question about the slime night.
[18123.22s -> 18125.22s]  Okay. That's going to be the 31st
[18125.22s -> 18127.22s]  right? Also how are you handling
[18127.22s -> 18129.22s]  the slime? Because I'd expect it's going to create a mess
[18129.22s -> 18131.22s]  on your gear and your headphones.
[18131.22s -> 18133.22s]  Are you saran wrapping your home room?
[18133.22s -> 18135.22s]  Doing it in a studio I cannot imagine how
[18135.22s -> 18137.22s]  awful getting the slime out of the equipment be.
[18137.22s -> 18139.89s]  You'll see.
[18139.89s -> 18142.45s]  It's not going to
[18142.45s -> 18144.88s]  be in my room.
[18144.88s -> 18146.88s]  So don't worry. That's not
[18146.88s -> 18151.55s]  going to happen. There is
[18151.55s -> 18153.55s]  a whole
[18153.55s -> 18155.55s]  the last week and a half
[18155.55s -> 18157.55s]  or so since I first started talking about it
[18157.55s -> 18159.55s]  has been complete and total planning.
[18159.55s -> 18161.55s]  Every day that I'm not on stream essentially.
[18161.55s -> 18164.11s]  And it's almost
[18164.11s -> 18166.11s]  ready to go completely. So
[18166.11s -> 18168.29s]  don't worry. That is completely
[18168.29s -> 18172.06s]  and totally taken care of.
[18172.06s -> 18174.06s]  He's going to do it on his bed. No that's
[18174.06s -> 18176.43s]  not where this is going to be. But
[18176.43s -> 18178.61s]  yes it's supposed to be
[18178.61s -> 18180.61s]  on Halloween. Halloween
[18180.61s -> 18183.36s]  day. I know a lot of people
[18183.36s -> 18185.36s]  have things to do on Halloween night usually.
[18185.36s -> 18187.54s]  So it's going to be Halloween
[18187.54s -> 18189.54s]  afternoon into
[18189.54s -> 18191.54s]  Halloween evening.
[18191.54s -> 18198.32s]  Should be fun. And it's not just
[18198.32s -> 18200.32s]  going to be a slime stream. Let me make that
[18200.32s -> 18202.32s]  really clear. There's at least two or three
[18202.32s -> 18204.69s]  segments on that stream that are
[18204.69s -> 18206.69s]  not sliming. There are other things
[18206.69s -> 18208.69s]  that could be Halloween related.
[18208.69s -> 18211.50s]  Slime is just the main event.
[18211.50s -> 18217.06s]  You know how we do it. Mind my halo
[18217.06s -> 18219.06s]  thanks for the ten dollars thousand
[18219.06s -> 18221.06s]  bits. There's no message but
[18221.06s -> 18223.06s]  just thank you for the ten dollar
[18223.06s -> 18229.65s]  drop. Thank you shitty viewbot
[18229.65s -> 18231.65s]  for the five hundred bits. Last time you mentioned
[18231.65s -> 18233.65s]  Scream Fortress you said ask me again.
[18233.65s -> 18235.65s]  Well I'm asking you again. Is there any chance for
[18235.65s -> 18237.65s]  a TF2 Scream Fortress stream?
[18237.65s -> 18241.66s]  No. I will
[18241.66s -> 18243.66s]  probably not stream
[18243.66s -> 18245.97s]  Team Fortress 2 ever again.
[18245.97s -> 18252.22s]  I don't think so.
[18252.22s -> 18254.22s]  Like I said before there would need to
[18254.22s -> 18256.22s]  be a
[18256.22s -> 18258.22s]  significant major
[18258.22s -> 18260.22s]  change to the game for me to get
[18260.22s -> 18262.22s]  interested in it again. Because let's be
[18262.22s -> 18264.22s]  completely and totally honest here.
[18264.22s -> 18266.22s]  Scream Fortress is just
[18266.22s -> 18268.40s]  it's the Halloween update.
[18268.40s -> 18270.40s]  It's not like a major
[18270.40s -> 18272.40s]  change to the game. It's a
[18272.40s -> 18274.40s]  few cool maps and some cosmetics
[18274.40s -> 18276.40s]  and stuff. It's not
[18276.40s -> 18278.77s]  it's not anything that's like a big big
[18278.77s -> 18280.77s]  big major change.
[18280.77s -> 18284.74s]  And even when sometimes they've done
[18284.74s -> 18286.74s]  updates that have brought a couple
[18286.74s -> 18288.74s]  of new items and a couple of new scenarios
[18288.74s -> 18290.74s]  it's what it kind of
[18290.74s -> 18293.10s]  wasn't enough. You have to
[18293.10s -> 18295.10s]  remember I put
[18295.10s -> 18297.10s]  almost
[18297.10s -> 18299.10s]  six seven straight years
[18299.10s -> 18301.10s]  into that game.
[18301.10s -> 18304.50s]  And I sort of closed the book on it.
[18304.50s -> 18306.50s]  There are other things that I'd like to do
[18306.50s -> 18313.98s]  that are not that
[18313.98s -> 18317.95s]  he hates it.
[18317.95s -> 18319.95s]  No but it's kind of it's one of those scenarios
[18319.95s -> 18321.95s]  where I like to look back
[18321.95s -> 18323.95s]  at how awesome that community was
[18323.95s -> 18326.58s]  and how amazing those
[18326.58s -> 18328.58s]  five plus straight years of my life were.
[18328.58s -> 18331.46s]  I put a lot
[18331.46s -> 18333.46s]  I was playing TF2 before
[18333.46s -> 18335.46s]  Steam even counted the hours.
[18335.46s -> 18337.46s]  And that's when I spent the most time in it.
[18337.46s -> 18342.58s]  But I don't think there would be a scenario
[18342.58s -> 18344.58s]  where it'd be like hey here's like a
[18344.58s -> 18346.58s]  TF2 livestream.
[18346.58s -> 18349.01s]  I don't really have any
[18349.01s -> 18351.01s]  that's not like doing it for me.
[18351.01s -> 18353.18s]  Like it could have maybe
[18353.18s -> 18355.62s]  used to years ago.
[18355.62s -> 18367.46s]  You want to see TF2 get the love it deserves
[18367.46s -> 18370.78s]  from Valve?
[18370.78s -> 18372.78s]  Yeah but that would mean Valve would
[18372.78s -> 18374.78s]  Valve has not been very game
[18374.78s -> 18376.78s]  centric over the last
[18376.78s -> 18378.78s]  five years.
[18378.78s -> 18380.78s]  They've been more hardware and business centric.
[18380.78s -> 18382.78s]  And it's done
[18382.78s -> 18385.09s]  really well for them.
[18385.09s -> 18387.09s]  Everybody wants Valve to make games
[18387.09s -> 18389.09s]  but Valve has done
[18389.09s -> 18391.09s]  has changed
[18391.09s -> 18393.09s]  they're just incredibly lucrative
[18393.09s -> 18395.09s]  when they focused on Steam
[18395.09s -> 18397.84s]  and the VR stuff.
[18397.84s -> 18400.02s]  If they ever actually
[18400.02s -> 18402.02s]  and they're supposed to be
[18402.02s -> 18404.02s]  they're supposed to be developing something for VR.
[18404.02s -> 18411.89s]  That's what everyone says right?
[18411.89s -> 18413.89s]  Half Life 3 VR. I know that's
[18413.89s -> 18415.89s]  the thing that everyone says now.
[18415.89s -> 18418.45s]  And even if it's not
[18418.45s -> 18420.88s]  they're doing something.
[18420.88s -> 18422.88s]  But it would take something significant.
[18422.88s -> 18424.88s]  Valve would have to really decide
[18424.88s -> 18426.88s]  that something like Team Fortress was
[18426.88s -> 18429.25s]  alright we're going to go back
[18429.25s -> 18431.25s]  to TF2 and we're going to develop
[18431.25s -> 18433.25s]  like six new official maps.
[18433.25s -> 18435.25s]  We're going to make a new game mode
[18435.25s -> 18437.25s]  and it's going to be 12 new items
[18437.25s -> 18439.25s]  and we're going to rebalance a bunch more stuff.
[18439.25s -> 18442.19s]  But it's almost it's hard for that to
[18442.19s -> 18444.19s]  even happen because at what point
[18444.19s -> 18446.19s]  is it they've added so
[18446.19s -> 18448.19s]  much stuff to TF2.
[18448.19s -> 18450.19s]  They've done they've added
[18450.19s -> 18452.19s]  so many items
[18452.19s -> 18454.19s]  and weapons and game modes
[18454.19s -> 18456.19s]  and maps and at what
[18456.19s -> 18458.19s]  point do they not have very much
[18458.19s -> 18465.23s]  else to do.
[18465.23s -> 18467.54s]  They've added whole class
[18467.54s -> 18469.54s]  whole new class worth
[18469.54s -> 18476.77s]  of items dozens of times.
[18476.77s -> 18478.77s]  So it's almost like I know everyone's oh man
[18478.77s -> 18480.77s]  I wish Valve would make like 25
[18480.77s -> 18482.77s]  new weapons and items
[18482.77s -> 18485.20s]  but they've already come up with so many
[18485.20s -> 18487.20s]  and in the scheme the grand scheme of what
[18487.20s -> 18490.34s]  that game is it's not
[18490.34s -> 18492.70s]  that you're limited it's that
[18492.70s -> 18494.70s]  they've done probably so much
[18494.70s -> 18496.70s]  stuff that they can't really probably come up
[18496.70s -> 18498.70s]  with what the hell are we going to give
[18498.70s -> 18501.78s]  like the fucking spy.
[18501.78s -> 18503.78s]  He's got like 12 15 different
[18503.78s -> 18510.62s]  knives and guns and
[18510.62s -> 18516.58s]  give him a fire knife a
[18516.58s -> 18519.07s]  knife gun yeah
[18519.07s -> 18522.59s]  and that's the thing though that when they come up with this many
[18522.59s -> 18524.59s]  things they come up with so many items and weapons
[18524.59s -> 18526.59s]  he's got like a bunch of revolvers and people only use
[18526.59s -> 18535.42s]  one or two of them.
[18535.42s -> 18537.42s]  I think the era of TF2
[18537.42s -> 18539.42s]  and here's the thing about
[18539.42s -> 18543.07s]  TF2 TF2
[18543.07s -> 18545.07s]  everybody wants to emulate how
[18545.07s -> 18547.07s]  fun that game is and how much
[18547.07s -> 18549.07s]  awesome it was and how everybody
[18549.07s -> 18551.07s]  cared about it. You see
[18551.07s -> 18553.07s]  so many games pop up now that are just
[18553.07s -> 18555.07s]  desperately trying to tap that
[18555.07s -> 18557.07s]  fun interesting
[18557.07s -> 18559.07s]  funny community
[18559.07s -> 18561.07s]  game and it's almost impossible.
[18561.07s -> 18571.44s]  There was a string
[18571.44s -> 18573.44s]  of at least a few years in a row
[18573.44s -> 18575.44s]  back in like 2013
[18575.44s -> 18577.44s]  14 15 into like 2016
[18577.44s -> 18579.44s]  where everyone wanted to be
[18579.44s -> 18581.44s]  everyone wanted to make that next awesome
[18581.44s -> 18583.44s]  Team Fortress style game that
[18583.44s -> 18585.44s]  everyone cared about but
[18585.44s -> 18587.74s]  yeah somebody just said it's a timeless
[18587.74s -> 18589.74s]  masterpiece it is.
[18589.74s -> 18591.74s]  So that's why it's hard to do another
[18591.74s -> 18593.74s]  one and I think that's why they're afraid to do
[18593.74s -> 18595.74s]  another one maybe not afraid it's the wrong word
[18595.74s -> 18598.18s]  but when you make something that's so
[18598.18s -> 18600.18s]  good that from its
[18600.18s -> 18602.18s]  when it was from release
[18602.18s -> 18604.18s]  to all through all these updates
[18604.18s -> 18606.18s]  and it is a actual
[18606.18s -> 18608.18s]  like first person shooter
[18608.18s -> 18610.18s]  solidified in history as
[18610.18s -> 18612.18s]  one of the best that has been ever made
[18612.18s -> 18614.18s]  so you have to make another one
[18614.18s -> 18616.18s]  and you have to make it as good or better than
[18616.18s -> 18619.25s]  that one. It's a
[18619.25s -> 18621.62s]  lot of pressure and a lot
[18621.62s -> 18623.62s]  of work to try to stand on
[18623.62s -> 18627.78s]  your own shoulders but we'll
[18627.78s -> 18635.39s]  see what they do and people will if
[18635.39s -> 18637.39s]  Team Fortress 3 gets announced
[18637.39s -> 18640.08s]  can you imagine how
[18640.08s -> 18642.08s]  everybody will everyone will be so
[18642.08s -> 18644.08s]  excited for it oh this is gonna be
[18644.08s -> 18646.08s]  the best game ever made it's a new
[18646.08s -> 18648.08s]  engine they're doing source 3 it's gonna
[18648.08s -> 18650.08s]  launch source 3 they've got like
[18650.08s -> 18652.08s]  two new classes and look
[18652.08s -> 18654.08s]  at all these new maps and there's like a whole
[18654.08s -> 18656.08s]  MVM new single player it's gonna be so good
[18656.08s -> 18658.08s]  if that game is not the
[18658.08s -> 18660.08s]  best game you've ever played
[18660.08s -> 18663.73s]  if it has to hit that expectation
[18663.73s -> 18665.73s]  otherwise it's just ah
[18665.73s -> 18667.73s]  fuck it wasn't really
[18667.73s -> 18670.10s]  that good I wish they didn't
[18670.10s -> 18672.10s]  do it in the first place then you think look at Diablo 3
[18672.10s -> 18675.36s]  do you know how long
[18675.36s -> 18677.36s]  I've wanted Diablo 3 for
[18677.36s -> 18679.54s]  Diablo 3
[18679.54s -> 18681.54s]  Diablo 2 is one of my favorite games ever made it's one of
[18681.54s -> 18683.54s]  my favorite fucking games I love it
[18683.54s -> 18686.22s]  so much and every
[18686.22s -> 18688.22s]  day I prayed for a Diablo
[18688.22s -> 18690.22s]  3 I thought about all the new
[18690.22s -> 18692.22s]  items they would be making a new
[18692.22s -> 18694.22s]  engine oh it would be so great
[18694.22s -> 18696.22s]  there would be endless content
[18696.22s -> 18698.22s]  there would be so much awesome shit you could do
[18698.22s -> 18700.22s]  just give us Diablo 3 please
[18700.22s -> 18702.22s]  and it's almost like
[18702.22s -> 18704.22s]  the monkey's paw right
[18704.22s -> 18707.23s]  like you got it
[18707.23s -> 18709.23s]  and it really wasn't
[18709.23s -> 18711.60s]  what I wanted
[18711.60s -> 18713.60s]  Diablo 3 was fun
[18713.60s -> 18716.03s]  but it was not the thing that I
[18716.03s -> 18723.14s]  wanted at what cost
[18723.14s -> 18725.14s]  they made it they tried
[18725.14s -> 18727.14s]  to do the whole money auction house thing and
[18727.14s -> 18729.14s]  you could look over that for a little while but
[18729.14s -> 18731.38s]  items didn't drop the problem with
[18731.38s -> 18733.38s]  D3 the very beginning of the game the game was like
[18733.38s -> 18735.62s]  a month old
[18735.62s -> 18737.62s]  the unique the legendaries the unique items
[18737.62s -> 18740.37s]  that's what we call them
[18740.37s -> 18742.37s]  they didn't drop and they were just random
[18742.37s -> 18744.37s]  stats and shit it was just
[18744.37s -> 18746.37s]  dog shit it was dog shit
[18746.37s -> 18751.10s]  Reaper's Souls came out and
[18751.10s -> 18753.10s]  they actually did a lot of good
[18753.10s -> 18755.10s]  they fixed a lot of stuff
[18755.10s -> 18757.10s]  what's the
[18757.10s -> 18759.10s]  the lead dev of
[18759.10s -> 18761.10s]  Reaper's Souls
[18761.10s -> 18763.92s]  he tried to do his best
[18763.92s -> 18765.92s]  and I don't think that guy works for the company anymore
[18765.92s -> 18767.92s]  he like fixed Reaper
[18767.92s -> 18769.92s]  he fixed Diablo 3
[18769.92s -> 18771.92s]  and I think they got rid
[18771.92s -> 18775.57s]  of him did that happen am I remembering
[18775.57s -> 18781.58s]  this correctly yeah he left
[18781.58s -> 18790.70s]  yes why
[18790.70s -> 18792.70s]  why wouldn't you make sure that
[18792.70s -> 18795.46s]  that person was
[18795.46s -> 18797.46s]  responsible for your next Diablo
[18797.46s -> 18800.02s]  iteration that's
[18800.02s -> 18802.02s]  it's like almost
[18802.02s -> 18804.02s]  he
[18804.02s -> 18806.64s]  yeah
[18806.64s -> 18808.64s]  his name is Josh Martens
[18808.64s -> 18813.36s]  this dude and
[18813.36s -> 18815.36s]  obviously some of the other talented people that worked with him
[18815.36s -> 18817.36s]  and underneath him right
[18817.36s -> 18819.36s]  but this dude at all these
[18819.36s -> 18821.36s]  they took that game and they made it
[18821.36s -> 18826.10s]  actually like fun
[18826.10s -> 18828.10s]  alright well you want to do
[18828.10s -> 18830.66s]  Diablo 4 it'd be great
[18830.66s -> 18832.66s]  if you did it because from the ground up
[18832.66s -> 18834.66s]  you probably would have some better ideas
[18834.66s -> 18841.25s]  like what the fuck happened
[18841.25s -> 18846.24s]  like what
[18846.24s -> 18848.24s]  if they okay if Blizzard announces
[18848.24s -> 18850.24s]  forget about like all the other
[18850.24s -> 18852.24s]  controversy that Blizzard is seeing
[18852.24s -> 18854.24s]  right now if Diablo 4 is announced
[18854.24s -> 18856.24s]  I don't what the fuck is this game even going to be
[18856.24s -> 18866.35s]  who even made this game
[18866.35s -> 18868.35s]  Josh Mascara not
[18868.35s -> 18870.35s]  Martens okay yeah I want to make sure I get that right
[18870.35s -> 18876.62s]  Josh Mascara and Kevin Martens
[18876.62s -> 18878.62s]  were the directors of Reaper's Souls
[18878.62s -> 18881.57s]  and after everybody said
[18881.57s -> 18883.57s]  all the critics all the fans
[18883.57s -> 18885.57s]  were like wow
[18885.57s -> 18887.57s]  I mean Diablo 3 still isn't that
[18887.57s -> 18889.57s]  good it's still like not what I wanted
[18889.57s -> 18891.57s]  but this is actually
[18891.57s -> 18893.57s]  really good they like took what they
[18893.57s -> 18895.57s]  took all the broken systems
[18895.57s -> 18897.57s]  and they made them all work and then they made the game
[18897.57s -> 18904.16s]  fun you don't have
[18904.16s -> 18906.16s]  those people stick around
[18906.16s -> 18912.50s]  it's like it's just counter
[18912.50s -> 18925.74s]  productive I bought D3
[18925.74s -> 18927.74s]  on release and regret it deeply all my friends accounts
[18927.74s -> 18929.74s]  got stolen within the first oh jeez
[18929.74s -> 18935.82s]  that's not good
[18935.82s -> 18937.82s]  he like Diablo
[18937.82s -> 18939.82s]  me click on enemy push number
[18939.82s -> 18941.82s]  keys once every hour
[18941.82s -> 18945.34s]  right but you're
[18945.34s -> 18947.34s]  that you're referencing Diablo
[18947.34s -> 18949.52s]  3 Diablo 2
[18949.52s -> 18951.52s]  was a dangerous fucking game if you
[18951.52s -> 18953.52s]  okay look there's let me be
[18953.52s -> 18956.08s]  if you played Diablo 2
[18956.08s -> 18958.08s]  and you did like the exploity kind of
[18958.08s -> 18960.08s]  ways to just mow through everything
[18960.08s -> 18962.08s]  once you play on like when you get to Nightmare in Hell
[18962.08s -> 18964.08s]  in Diablo 2 it was a dangerous game
[18964.08s -> 18970.86s]  you were at
[18970.86s -> 18973.17s]  risk of dying in every
[18973.17s -> 18975.17s]  room in Diablo 2
[18975.17s -> 18977.17s]  especially when you got past like level 20
[18977.17s -> 18982.66s]  Diablo 3
[18982.66s -> 18984.66s]  was just a nut it
[18984.66s -> 18987.15s]  was an idle game
[18987.15s -> 18989.15s]  at it's very very core once you got
[18989.15s -> 18991.15s]  once it got to complete late game it was an idle game
[18991.15s -> 18994.22s]  and you just waited
[18994.22s -> 18996.59s]  until this thing
[18996.59s -> 18998.59s]  dropped letters on the ground
[18998.59s -> 19000.59s]  that you walked over and did you get
[19000.59s -> 19002.59s]  just open it
[19002.59s -> 19004.59s]  and what is it okay no it's not better than what I have
[19004.59s -> 19006.59s]  we're gonna just watch the numbers again
[19006.59s -> 19015.10s]  the ever changing difficulty slider in
[19015.10s -> 19017.10s]  Diablo 3 was a bad idea bad design
[19017.10s -> 19021.97s]  maybe but
[19021.97s -> 19023.97s]  I think there's probably ways to do
[19023.97s -> 19027.94s]  that there's ways to do like
[19027.94s -> 19029.94s]  a never ending difficulty slider
[19029.94s -> 19032.37s]  without it being
[19032.37s -> 19034.61s]  well I mean never ending is the wrong
[19034.61s -> 19036.61s]  word there really should only be like
[19036.61s -> 19039.87s]  five difficulties
[19039.87s -> 19041.87s]  the regular game cause there was like even
[19041.87s -> 19044.18s]  you would put that slider
[19044.18s -> 19046.18s]  on hard
[19046.18s -> 19048.18s]  or very hard and it was just
[19048.18s -> 19050.67s]  the normal game the issue
[19050.67s -> 19052.67s]  with Diablo 3 in the end
[19052.67s -> 19054.67s]  was the normal game
[19054.67s -> 19056.67s]  was absolutely
[19056.67s -> 19058.67s]  just brainless
[19058.67s -> 19060.67s]  you couldn't even
[19060.67s -> 19063.17s]  lose you could just walk into
[19063.17s -> 19065.17s]  rooms and things it wasn't even hard
[19065.17s -> 19067.17s]  the game was not even it was so easy
[19067.17s -> 19070.69s]  so on it's lowest kind of end
[19070.69s -> 19072.69s]  like the first three difficulties were just
[19072.69s -> 19074.69s]  why would you even do them there's too easy
[19074.69s -> 19076.69s]  and the last three difficulties
[19076.69s -> 19078.69s]  were not even possible
[19078.69s -> 19081.95s]  it's just such a
[19081.95s -> 19084.45s]  scale was just off have
[19084.45s -> 19086.45s]  a normal base game that's challenging and fun
[19086.45s -> 19088.45s]  have a difficulty after that
[19088.45s -> 19090.82s]  that's harder have a difficulty
[19090.82s -> 19092.82s]  after that that's really fucking hard
[19092.82s -> 19094.82s]  like a normal nightmare
[19094.82s -> 19096.82s]  hell you want to have inferno
[19096.82s -> 19098.82s]  have it be sure have
[19098.82s -> 19100.82s]  inferno have inferno be stupid
[19100.82s -> 19103.70s]  and like impossible
[19103.70s -> 19105.70s]  but that's like the plus that's like the
[19105.70s -> 19107.70s]  game plus mode
[19107.70s -> 19113.50s]  you don't have to do that there's like
[19113.50s -> 19115.50s]  how many there were like twelve difficulties
[19115.50s -> 19124.59s]  in Diablo 3
[19124.59s -> 19127.92s]  there's a lot fifteen
[19127.92s -> 19133.68s]  that's even more than I thought
[19133.68s -> 19136.75s]  there are nineteen now
[19136.75s -> 19138.75s]  why even have difficulties then
[19138.75s -> 19140.75s]  why not just have prestige
[19140.75s -> 19143.25s]  what's the point of having
[19143.25s -> 19145.25s]  difficulties why don't you just prestige
[19145.25s -> 19147.25s]  give up all your shit and then start at level one
[19147.25s -> 19149.25s]  and the game's harder
[19149.25s -> 19160.45s]  what's the point of having a slider
[19160.45s -> 19162.45s]  and if you don't want to prestige you just don't
[19162.45s -> 19165.97s]  just uncheck a box
[19165.97s -> 19167.97s]  that's what seasons is
[19167.97s -> 19169.97s]  seasons doesn't change the difficulty
[19169.97s -> 19172.91s]  seasons is just the
[19172.91s -> 19175.60s]  that's not a difficulty thing right
[19175.60s -> 19177.60s]  should you play Diablo 2 it really depends
[19177.60s -> 19181.18s]  because Diablo 2
[19181.18s -> 19183.81s]  is old and a lot of
[19183.81s -> 19185.81s]  people can't get over that
[19185.81s -> 19187.81s]  old school video game feel
[19187.81s -> 19190.50s]  there's a lot of things in Diablo 2
[19190.50s -> 19192.50s]  that are stupid
[19192.50s -> 19194.50s]  that really suck that you have to get over
[19194.50s -> 19198.72s]  it's just an old old
[19198.72s -> 19200.72s]  game that never got
[19200.72s -> 19202.96s]  the remaster treatment
[19202.96s -> 19204.96s]  never got the remake treatment
[19204.96s -> 19206.96s]  it's just an old ass game that's really really good
[19206.96s -> 19209.78s]  stupid
[19209.78s -> 19211.78s]  equals bad
[19211.78s -> 19221.12s]  greater than bad yeah
[19221.12s -> 19223.12s]  you gonna play the weird minecraft Diablo clone
[19223.12s -> 19225.12s]  I don't know
[19225.12s -> 19228.51s]  it depends on if it's any good
[19228.51s -> 19230.51s]  but we went from scream fortress
[19230.51s -> 19232.51s]  to talk about I don't know Diablo somehow
[19232.51s -> 19234.82s]  yeah the whole Diablo thing
[19234.82s -> 19237.06s]  really it's
[19237.06s -> 19239.06s]  that's close to my chest cause
[19239.06s -> 19241.55s]  it's literally one of my favorite
[19241.55s -> 19245.14s]  things ever and that's why
[19245.14s -> 19247.14s]  stuff like Diablo immortal Diablo
[19247.14s -> 19249.57s]  4 I
[19249.57s -> 19251.57s]  can't I'm not gonna get excited for those games
[19251.57s -> 19253.87s]  and there's no I don't
[19253.87s -> 19257.01s]  have a reason to because
[19257.01s -> 19259.01s]  everybody that ever was really involved in
[19259.01s -> 19261.01s]  any of the original stuff just didn't there anymore
[19261.01s -> 19263.38s]  it's like they have all these
[19263.38s -> 19265.38s]  assets randomly that have been canned over
[19265.38s -> 19268.06s]  the years who knows
[19268.06s -> 19270.06s]  like the Diablo 4 might have
[19270.06s -> 19272.06s]  Titan assets
[19272.06s -> 19275.52s]  remember that that a lot of that turned
[19275.52s -> 19286.21s]  into Overwatch who knows
[19286.21s -> 19288.21s]  there's not a good demand for those games anymore
[19288.21s -> 19291.02s]  and that's another thing too yeah
[19291.02s -> 19293.02s]  people just top
[19293.02s -> 19295.26s]  down ARPGs
[19295.26s -> 19297.26s]  at least in the realm of like Diablo and like
[19297.26s -> 19299.26s]  loot collecting and stuff people would rather
[19299.26s -> 19301.26s]  loot collection is still very much alive
[19301.26s -> 19303.26s]  but people would rather
[19303.26s -> 19305.26s]  get their loot from
[19305.26s -> 19307.26s]  first person shooters or out of a box
[19307.26s -> 19311.49s]  they took
[19311.49s -> 19313.49s]  that Diablo formula
[19313.49s -> 19315.49s]  was transformed into a box you
[19315.49s -> 19329.95s]  pay two dollars for
[19329.95s -> 19331.95s]  Path of Exile you hit enemies with a rubber sword
[19331.95s -> 19333.95s]  yeah Path of Exile is awesome
[19333.95s -> 19336.19s]  I just don't like the camera
[19336.19s -> 19338.88s]  it's something that's it's kind of
[19338.88s -> 19351.55s]  hard for me to get over
[19351.55s -> 19353.55s]  uncensored what's the name what
[19353.55s -> 19358.16s]  that's an interesting problem what's the problem with
[19358.16s -> 19360.59s]  the camera it's I
[19360.59s -> 19362.59s]  think it's it's too close
[19362.59s -> 19367.33s]  I wish I could pull the camera
[19367.33s -> 19369.33s]  out like 20%
[19369.33s -> 19371.33s]  more in Path of Exile
[19371.33s -> 19373.33s]  and I wish it
[19373.33s -> 19375.50s]  was angled a
[19375.50s -> 19377.50s]  little bit more
[19377.50s -> 19379.50s]  like a few like five degrees
[19379.50s -> 19381.50s]  ten degrees more than it is right now
[19381.50s -> 19391.10s]  but that's the only reason why
[19391.10s -> 19393.47s]  and that's a very
[19393.47s -> 19395.47s]  very very just personal thing
[19395.47s -> 19397.47s]  as to why I can't play it
[19397.47s -> 19400.99s]  there are actually some
[19400.99s -> 19402.99s]  I think you can get mods for it or you can
[19402.99s -> 19404.99s]  get like window changers for
[19404.99s -> 19406.99s]  it but it's really not the same
[19406.99s -> 19408.99s]  if you run Path of Exile
[19408.99s -> 19410.99s]  in a window and you resize the window in really
[19410.99s -> 19412.99s]  strange ways you can kind of get more
[19412.99s -> 19414.99s]  viewing angle and but
[19414.99s -> 19417.23s]  it's not
[19417.23s -> 19428.69s]  ideal and I know that
[19428.69s -> 19430.69s]  problem that's not a problem
[19430.69s -> 19432.69s]  that anybody really
[19432.69s -> 19434.69s]  that's not an
[19434.69s -> 19436.69s]  issue to patch the game over
[19436.69s -> 19438.86s]  when a
[19438.86s -> 19440.86s]  handful of people just don't really like the camera
[19440.86s -> 19443.23s]  right like every
[19443.23s -> 19445.23s]  there are millions of people that have
[19445.23s -> 19447.23s]  played Path of Exile and loved every second of it
[19447.23s -> 19449.23s]  that don't care that doesn't bother them at all
[19449.23s -> 19451.23s]  so I really I do not
[19451.23s -> 19453.23s]  I never expected nor do I ever
[19453.23s -> 19455.23s]  expect them to be like oh like one guy
[19455.23s -> 19457.23s]  said he didn't like the camera so let's
[19457.23s -> 19459.23s]  spend a bunch of development
[19459.23s -> 19461.23s]  time making it so you can pull the camera out
[19461.23s -> 19463.23s]  by 20%
[19463.23s -> 19465.47s]  no I completely understand
[19465.47s -> 19472.37s]  but yeah
[19472.37s -> 19476.46s]  we can move on. Goad conversation
[19476.46s -> 19479.47s]  all interesting stuff
[19479.47s -> 19486.19s]  ACDC freak thanks

[19488.19s -> 19490.19s]  money on you than my Tinder profile

[19521.07s -> 19523.07s]  is so good I love monolith
[19523.07s -> 19525.07s]  they make such great games
[19525.07s -> 19527.07s]  how have I never played their original
[19527.07s -> 19529.07s]  FPS franchise
[19536.86s -> 19538.86s]  I'm gonna be in bed
[19538.86s -> 19540.86s]  Kim is gonna think I'm insane
[19540.86s -> 19542.86s]  I'm gonna be in bed lying there
[19542.86s -> 19544.86s]  just on my iPad just hanging out
[19544.86s -> 19546.86s]  after eating some dinner
[19546.86s -> 19548.86s]  and I was gonna think of oh shit
[19548.86s -> 19550.86s]  and it's gonna make me
[19550.86s -> 19552.86s]  laugh and there's gonna be no context
[19552.86s -> 19559.71s]  but thank you ACDC freak
[19559.71s -> 19561.71s]  thank you for giving
[19561.71s -> 19563.71s]  me ten dollars instead
[19563.71s -> 19565.71s]  of Tinder I guess
[19565.71s -> 19570.32s]  thank you also thank you
[19570.32s -> 19572.32s]  to Freudian Weapon for the 250 happy Wednesday
[19572.32s -> 19574.50s]  hope you feel better
[19574.50s -> 19576.50s]  try not to overdo it on another note
[19576.50s -> 19578.50s]  do you plan on dressing up for Halloween this year
[19578.50s -> 19580.50s]  I plan on
[19580.50s -> 19582.50s]  being in some sort of costume on stream
[19582.50s -> 19584.50s]  we'll see what it is I have not figured
[19584.50s -> 19590.19s]  it out yet but yeah I
[19590.19s -> 19592.19s]  am I'm not overdoing it I mean
[19592.19s -> 19594.19s]  this stream is only about I mean we've spent
[19594.19s -> 19596.19s]  a little bit more extra time here because we're getting into
[19596.19s -> 19598.19s]  some conversations but
[19598.19s -> 19600.19s]  I stopped at about five hours
[19600.19s -> 19602.19s]  four hours and like 45 minutes that's probably what it'll
[19602.19s -> 19604.19s]  be like tomorrow somewhere around like four
[19604.19s -> 19606.19s]  four four and a half five
[19606.19s -> 19609.97s]  I'm trying just to
[19609.97s -> 19611.97s]  be easy but
[19611.97s -> 19613.97s]  over the in the long term
[19613.97s -> 19615.97s]  it won't be less time on stream
[19615.97s -> 19617.97s]  it'll just be spread over more days
[19617.97s -> 19619.97s]  so that'll be should be fine
[19619.97s -> 19624.83s]  but thank you I appreciate the concern
[19624.83s -> 19627.26s]  Siroc thanks for the 250
[19627.26s -> 19629.26s]  they say B E E T
[19629.26s -> 19631.26s]  L E J U I
[19631.26s -> 19633.26s]  I S E C E
[19633.26s -> 19636.08s]  I can't say that a third time
[19636.08s -> 19638.08s]  or I will get sucked into into hell
[19638.08s -> 19642.16s]  thank you thank you the thrill
[19642.16s -> 19644.16s]  for the 500 bits I remember playing
[19644.16s -> 19646.16s]  this game years ago and my god the sounds
[19646.16s -> 19648.16s]  and ragdoll physics is still insanely funny
[19648.16s -> 19650.16s]  the game in series really does hold
[19650.16s -> 19652.16s]  up well today which is pretty cool
[19652.16s -> 19654.16s]  hope your poops aren't spooky
[19654.16s -> 19658.64s]  yeah it does
[19658.64s -> 19660.64s]  I'm surprised this game is this
[19660.64s -> 19663.01s]  old when games are this old
[19663.01s -> 19665.38s]  they are not that good
[19665.38s -> 19667.38s]  they might be funny but they're not
[19667.38s -> 19669.38s]  fun to play this game is actually fun
[19669.38s -> 19676.03s]  to play too
[19676.03s -> 19678.03s]  the rest of the franchise is really not that good
[19678.03s -> 19680.03s]  yeah maybe I'll do
[19680.03s -> 19682.03s]  them eventually I know that I just wanted to do this
[19682.03s -> 19684.03s]  one because I just heard
[19684.03s -> 19686.03s]  so many good things about it and I never put any
[19686.03s -> 19688.59s]  time into it but here we are
[19688.59s -> 19692.82s]  no uh Freudian thanks for the 250
[19692.82s -> 19694.82s]  my last bit message got messed up tried
[19694.82s -> 19696.82s]  to put a germa heart emote so have
[19696.82s -> 19701.47s]  another thank you
[19701.47s -> 19703.47s]  uh Jason thanks for the 250 what was your
[19703.47s -> 19705.47s]  most embarrassing moment on stream
[19705.47s -> 19707.90s]  uh pick one of these two either
[19707.90s -> 19709.90s]  slapping myself in the face or
[19709.90s -> 19711.90s]  crying to a
[19711.90s -> 19713.90s]  farting and screaming
[19713.90s -> 19716.91s]  compilation both pretty
[19716.91s -> 19718.91s]  embarrassing I'm not sure
[19718.91s -> 19725.31s]  which one is worse one of those
[19725.31s -> 19729.41s]  uh thank you
[19729.41s -> 19731.41s]  Zeon WASD for the 500
[19731.41s -> 19735.06s]  bits bro where the
[19735.06s -> 19737.06s]  literal teeny parts of the universe
[19737.06s -> 19739.06s]  who invented the idea of things
[19739.06s -> 19741.06s]  meaning things so
[19741.06s -> 19743.06s]  things just mean whatever they
[19743.06s -> 19745.06s]  we say they do where are the
[19745.06s -> 19747.06s]  arbiters also I'm sorry for
[19747.06s -> 19749.06s]  saying fuck you that one time
[19749.06s -> 19751.06s]  so Resident Evil 2 Claire
[19751.06s -> 19753.06s]  campaign fuck you
[19753.06s -> 19759.20s]  that's what I'm saying yeah that's
[19759.20s -> 19761.20s]  what I said I said like we have made
[19761.20s -> 19763.20s]  up that idea of giving things
[19763.20s -> 19765.20s]  meaning by things that we say
[19765.20s -> 19770.58s]  but hey I appreciate the fuck you
[19770.58s -> 19776.21s]  thank you Gondrelaine thanks for the
[19776.21s -> 19778.21s]  250 since it's been a while since you did some DOS
[19778.21s -> 19780.21s]  the archive just added over 2500
[19780.21s -> 19782.21s]  hundred new DOS games
[19782.21s -> 19784.77s]  I did see that
[19784.77s -> 19786.77s]  that seems insane I know you stop
[19786.77s -> 19788.77s]  the streams because you were digging too deep into the vault
[19788.77s -> 19790.77s]  and the games were getting worse
[19790.77s -> 19792.77s]  but the new games should add new stuff
[19792.77s -> 19795.14s]  or a new stream also a good
[19795.14s -> 19797.14s]  idea would be a horror DOS game stream if you want
[19797.14s -> 19800.02s]  I love you Jerma
[19800.02s -> 19802.02s]  more DOS games playable yeah we'll go back to it
[19802.02s -> 19804.90s]  we'll check them out see if there's any
[19804.90s -> 19813.09s]  better ones any new good ones that's
[19813.09s -> 19815.52s]  the thing when you have a list of
[19815.52s -> 19817.52s]  like 5000 games that are on a
[19817.52s -> 19819.82s]  page you just go wow
[19819.82s -> 19821.82s]  how are we going to do this
[19821.82s -> 19824.51s]  how are we going to do this reliably
[19824.51s -> 19829.25s]  but those streams some of the most fun
[19829.25s -> 19831.25s]  I've had on stream this last year has been
[19831.25s -> 19833.25s]  on some of those DOS streams
[19833.25s -> 19835.25s]  so I definitely would like to do it again
[19835.25s -> 19837.25s]  but I want it to be the whole stream
[19837.25s -> 19839.94s]  because it seems like it's kind of in one of those scenarios
[19839.94s -> 19841.94s]  where it's oh we're going to do
[19841.94s -> 19843.94s]  this and that's going to be like four or five hours
[19843.94s -> 19845.94s]  and I guess we'll do DOS too but you would really
[19845.94s -> 19847.94s]  you have to focus a full
[19847.94s -> 19850.24s]  day on that
[19850.24s -> 19852.24s]  you need to give some of those games the
[19852.24s -> 19854.24s]  hour or two plus that they deserve
[19854.24s -> 19856.99s]  at least some of them
[19856.99s -> 19861.47s]  so yeah I agree we should go back and do it
[19861.47s -> 19864.16s]  thank you Jason
[19864.16s -> 19866.16s]  for the 250 please watch this I'm crying
[19866.16s -> 19869.68s]  my ass off
[19869.68s -> 19872.82s]  man what is this this is a
[19872.82s -> 19874.82s]  Twitter account

[20067.76s -> 20070.58s]  chunky IMAX
[20070.58s -> 20072.58s]  do you remember those things that were in the computer lab
[20072.58s -> 20074.58s]  they were different colors
[20074.58s -> 20081.10s]  they were red, blue,
[20081.10s -> 20084.24s]  green, orange
[20084.24s -> 20086.24s]  they were junk but I loved them
[20086.24s -> 20089.12s]  they were cool
[20089.12s -> 20091.30s]  it was just this
[20091.30s -> 20093.30s]  little shell that had everything
[20093.30s -> 20095.30s]  right there it was a little computer
[20095.30s -> 20097.30s]  this is insane
[20097.30s -> 20099.30s]  I remember what that room smells like
[20099.30s -> 20101.30s]  I remember what that computer smells like
[20101.30s -> 20103.79s]  that room had that IMAX
[20103.79s -> 20105.79s]  smell there was an IMAX room
[20105.79s -> 20108.22s]  smell it was

[20110.22s -> 20119.63s]  lab smell so every time I
[20119.63s -> 20121.63s]  think of an IMAX
[20121.63s -> 20123.63s]  I smell the computer lab
[20123.63s -> 20132.53s]  I can never explain what
[20132.53s -> 20134.53s]  that smell is I just know that
[20134.53s -> 20140.74s]  it exists it was great

[20200.94s -> 20202.94s]  that's good stuff
[20202.94s -> 20207.55s]  am I just starting or am I just ending

[20224.26s -> 20229.38s]  thank you we have a few more to get through
[20229.38s -> 20231.38s]  in the bits category here
[20231.38s -> 20234.58s]  modus pons
[20234.58s -> 20236.58s]  says there better be bugleberry on Halloween
[20236.58s -> 20238.58s]  don't give in to the haters
[20238.58s -> 20240.58s]  thanks for the 250
[20240.58s -> 20242.88s]  what makes you think I'm gonna give in to
[20242.88s -> 20244.88s]  people that hate that character
[20244.88s -> 20246.88s]  don't you think that's more of a reason why they would show up
[20246.88s -> 20255.07s]  I'm just saying if they were too
[20255.07s -> 20258.78s]  I'm not gonna say anything
[20258.78s -> 20260.78s]  I don't I mean I don't know what his schedule

[20262.78s -> 20275.14s]  thank you zion
[20275.14s -> 20277.14s]  WASD for the 500 bits
[20277.14s -> 20279.14s]  I'm actually sorry for saying fuck you though
[20279.14s -> 20281.14s]  I don't know how to express love dog
[20281.14s -> 20283.14s]  real question
[20283.14s -> 20285.14s]  are you ever gonna do stand up comedy on stage
[20285.14s -> 20287.14s]  and in person you're more funny while improvising
[20287.14s -> 20289.14s]  like most netflix comedians are with their super
[20289.14s -> 20291.14s]  well prepared specials
[20291.14s -> 20293.14s]  and your premeditated skits are even funnier
[20293.14s -> 20295.14s]  also any plans on voice acting
[20295.14s -> 20297.14s]  and anything you got some cords
[20297.14s -> 20300.91s]  uh no
[20300.91s -> 20303.34s]  I don't think I'll ever do it
[20303.34s -> 20306.03s]  unless it was for a specific
[20306.03s -> 20308.03s]  stream
[20308.03s -> 20310.03s]  where the point was I was gonna try
[20310.03s -> 20312.03s]  to do open mic night
[20312.03s -> 20314.03s]  I thought about that before
[20314.03s -> 20316.03s]  where I try to come up with
[20316.03s -> 20318.03s]  some material
[20318.03s -> 20320.03s]  to do a seven minute set
[20320.03s -> 20322.03s]  in open mic night
[20322.03s -> 20324.34s]  but that's the thing every time
[20324.34s -> 20326.34s]  I've come into this oh
[20326.34s -> 20328.34s]  should I do that would be fun I think that might be funny
[20328.34s -> 20330.34s]  I always hit the same wall
[20330.34s -> 20332.58s]  that's a ten minute
[20332.58s -> 20335.90s]  stream
[20335.90s -> 20337.90s]  that's it
[20337.90s -> 20345.65s]  there's nothing else there
[20345.65s -> 20347.65s]  I mean maybe if I want to do it one day and just turn it on
[20347.65s -> 20349.65s]  and just who cares I'm gonna do like a
[20349.65s -> 20354.32s]  fourteen minute stream
[20354.32s -> 20356.32s]  we'll see but I don't have really any plans
[20356.32s -> 20358.32s]  for it there are plans for other streams
[20358.32s -> 20360.32s]  coming up over the next few months
[20360.32s -> 20362.32s]  but that is not currently one of them
[20362.32s -> 20367.70s]  but thank you so much
[20367.70s -> 20371.73s]  I like what's going on here
[20371.73s -> 20374.54s]  you know this is where my focus is
[20374.54s -> 20377.94s]  completely so I don't think I could
[20377.94s -> 20379.94s]  I couldn't spread myself out if I really
[20379.94s -> 20381.94s]  wanted to like pursue a stand up comedy career
[20381.94s -> 20384.18s]  that's time that's a lot
[20384.18s -> 20386.18s]  of dedication it's a lot of work
[20386.18s -> 20388.18s]  I wouldn't want to split myself
[20388.18s -> 20392.78s]  up it takes a lot
[20392.78s -> 20396.69s]  to do that
[20396.69s -> 20398.69s]  thanks for the 250 thanks for playing fear Jerma
[20398.69s -> 20400.69s]  my big brother bought this game
[20400.69s -> 20402.69s]  and I was too young in a wuss to play
[20402.69s -> 20404.69s]  single player so I played only multiplayer
[20404.69s -> 20406.69s]  so I wouldn't get scared
[20406.69s -> 20408.69s]  it's great I love it
[20408.69s -> 20415.22s]  that's so cute
[20415.22s -> 20419.57s]  thank you though thanks for the 250
[20419.57s -> 20422.19s]  lizard and meatball thanks for the 500
[20422.19s -> 20424.19s]  bits it's me again
[20424.19s -> 20426.19s]  I have some more bits just wanted to make sure you know how much we
[20426.19s -> 20428.19s]  appreciate the creativity and effort you put into
[20428.19s -> 20430.19s]  your streams cause you really don't see
[20430.19s -> 20432.19s]  that every day anyway I hope things
[20432.19s -> 20434.19s]  get better with your illness soon have a great night
[20434.19s -> 20436.19s]  yeah we're just trying to figure out what's going on
[20436.19s -> 20438.94s]  the doctor right now is just kind of throwing
[20438.94s -> 20440.94s]  darts and we're gonna see if any
[20440.94s -> 20443.70s]  of them land so
[20443.70s -> 20447.90s]  good to go but yeah
[20447.90s -> 20449.90s]  I can reiterate one more time
[20449.90s -> 20451.90s]  as I say a lot
[20451.90s -> 20454.46s]  but I have to stay interested
[20454.46s -> 20456.46s]  or else I can't do this
[20456.46s -> 20460.75s]  if I am not interested if I'm
[20460.75s -> 20462.75s]  not having a good time and I'm not
[20462.75s -> 20464.75s]  focused and care about each stream
[20464.75s -> 20466.75s]  I can't stream
[20466.75s -> 20477.49s]  so he hates streaming
[20477.49s -> 20483.57s]  end of career
[20483.57s -> 20487.28s]  nah that's just the way
[20487.28s -> 20489.28s]  it is I can't change
[20489.28s -> 20493.12s]  that so as long
[20493.12s -> 20495.12s]  as I stay interested then I'm still
[20495.12s -> 20497.12s]  interested and I want to keep doing stuff and
[20497.12s -> 20499.12s]  keep doing keep streaming keep having fun that's
[20499.12s -> 20506.48s]  gonna keep happening but thank you

[20639.71s -> 20645.22s]  am I you gonna stay in Vegas
[20645.22s -> 20647.97s]  yes that's at least the immediate

[20650.21s -> 20656.42s]  stay here stay in Las Vegas
[20656.42s -> 20660.13s]  and I don't know
[20660.13s -> 20662.13s]  as I get older
[20662.13s -> 20664.37s]  there are a few things that may
[20664.37s -> 20666.37s]  or may not happen in my life
[20666.37s -> 20669.76s]  that I have to start to think about
[20669.76s -> 20671.76s]  you know there's a lot of things to think about
[20671.76s -> 20681.87s]  as you get a little older
[20681.87s -> 20691.41s]  kids
[20691.41s -> 20693.41s]  no but you understand
[20693.41s -> 20697.12s]  I we have a lot of

[20707.12s -> 20709.49s]  I am getting a little older
[20709.49s -> 20711.49s]  and you need to start you gotta think about what you
[20711.49s -> 20713.86s]  do when you get a little older
[20713.86s -> 20715.86s]  I don't know I have no
[20715.86s -> 20720.02s]  idea no more poo poo jokes
[20720.02s -> 20732.11s]  that's right well actually

[20796.22s -> 20798.22s]  to make I wanna make sure that I make the right
[20798.22s -> 20800.40s]  ones as I continue

[20816.37s -> 20818.37s]  for 250 just a random question do you plan
[20818.37s -> 20820.37s]  on checking out Meat Fortress
[20820.37s -> 20822.86s]  I don't have any plans to do

[20835.18s -> 20837.18s]  go back to kind of a normal
[20837.18s -> 20839.18s]  stream stuff

[20842.00s -> 20844.00s]  creepy scary stuff this month
[20844.00s -> 20846.00s]  and I've never done that before
[20846.00s -> 20848.56s]  by the way this is the
[20848.56s -> 20850.56s]  first time that I've spent significant time
[20850.56s -> 20852.99s]  back to back to back
[20852.99s -> 20854.99s]  to back doing scary horror
[20854.99s -> 20856.99s]  horror games
