[0.31s -> 14.79s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,
[14.79s -> 20.23s]  Otto in the background again, making all kinds of weird noises. But anyways, gonna be playing
[20.23s -> 27.19s]  as the spy tonight, using the strange dead ringer, the Letronger and the Big Earner.
[27.19s -> 32.47s]  And in the title somewhere, it probably says, the live forever setup or something like that.
[32.47s -> 36.95s]  Let me just briefly explain what I mean by that. So the Big Earner, if you don't know,
[36.95s -> 40.83s]  when you backstab somebody, you get cloak. Same thing with the Letronger, if you shoot
[40.83s -> 46.21s]  somebody you get cloak, and the dead ringer lets you fake your death. So what happens,
[46.21s -> 50.51s]  what ends up happening in most of the gameplays you use this with, you will get a backstab,
[50.51s -> 53.71s]  fill up your cloak, be able to pull the dead ringer out, you're alive. You get out of
[53.71s -> 57.63s]  the dead ringer, somebody sees you, you can't backstab them, shoot them two or three times,
[57.63s -> 63.51s]  let the dead ringer rinse and repeat. Now this may or may not be total overkill, but
[63.51s -> 67.27s]  I like to use weird setups sometimes, like to mess around with the loadouts. And this
[67.27s -> 71.56s]  actually does work pretty well, because as a spy, I used to be a really good spy back
[71.56s -> 76.28s]  in the old days, back in like 2007. And then once all the loadout options came out, all
[76.28s -> 81.72s]  the variables came out, I started to lose my spy deal, I started to not really do as
[81.72s -> 86.96s]  well as I used to. So stuff like this, any way that I can help myself play spy better,
[87.04s -> 92.55s]  I'm going to try it out. I guess the real downside to using this setup is of course
[92.55s -> 97.19s]  if you have full cloak and you backstab somebody, you're not going to get any cloak added to
[97.19s -> 103.58s]  your bar there because there's no over cloak. Oh my god, I just thought of like a new item.
[103.58s -> 107.64s]  What if there was an item that gave you over cloak, like an over heel, like if you got
[107.64s -> 112.52s]  over heeled, you got over cloaked. Oh, maybe I'm just going off on a weird tangent there.
[112.52s -> 117.68s]  But anyways, playing on King of the Hill Harvest right now, and I got to tell you, playing
[117.68s -> 122.36s]  on King of the Hill maps, they're like really the only places I can play spy anymore. I
[122.36s -> 127.12s]  can't play on payload anymore, I can't play on control point, I seem to die instantly.
[127.12s -> 131.60s]  Right when I kill somebody, I always just die. I'll get one backstab die, get one backstab
[131.60s -> 138.33s]  die. But back in the day, back when this game was in its real infancy stages, I was really,
[138.33s -> 142.59s]  really good at the spy. And I think I know what's happening. What's happened is a lot
[142.59s -> 145.95s]  of the players that have played this game for a long time, and even some of the free
[146.51s -> 152.27s]  new players, everybody's just getting better at this game. So it is definitely, definitely
[152.27s -> 157.43s]  getting harder to fool people. Because it's the whole adage, fool me once, shame on me.
[157.43s -> 163.28s]  Fool me twice, shame on you. I said that wrong. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice,
[163.28s -> 168.64s]  shame on me. There we go. I got it. But it's that old adage. It's, you know, you fool somebody
[168.64s -> 171.96s]  enough times, they're not going to get fooled anymore. And I think that's what's happening
[171.96s -> 176.44s]  in Team Fortress is, at least when I play spy, I feel like everybody knows exactly where
[176.44s -> 181.60s]  I am, where I'm going, and that sort of thing. And like I said, this can be totally attributed
[181.60s -> 186.40s]  to people just getting better at the game. And I love to see that, guys. I love to see
[186.40s -> 190.76s]  people getting really good at Team Fortress, because that means people are playing it.
[190.76s -> 194.80s]  You got to remember, to be able to be good at something, you have to really put time
[194.80s -> 199.24s]  into it. So to see these people all doing very, very well in a lot of the servers I
[199.24s -> 203.69s]  play on, it's great because it means Team Fortress is still alive and still running
[204.33s -> 207.37s]  And then they're going to tell their friends, once they're good enough, and once they know
[207.37s -> 210.29s]  how awesome the game is, they're going to tell their friends, their friends are going
[210.29s -> 215.96s]  to tell their friends, and Team Fortress hopefully will stay strong forever. And it's actually
[215.96s -> 220.50s]  getting a lot more attention than you'd think. A lot of the big YouTubers now, a lot of the
[220.50s -> 224.86s]  big commentators are starting to play Team Fortress. They're starting to get into it,
[224.86s -> 228.62s]  and they're starting to say, holy crap, this game is really fun. And they're going to start
[228.62s -> 232.86s]  making content on that. So stay tuned, but you're probably going to see a lot more Team
[232.90s -> 240.78s]  Fortress pop up in the YouTube scene in the very near future. That's my German prediction.
[240.78s -> 243.54s]  So I got to tell you one more thing before this video. There's only like another minute
[243.54s -> 249.61s]  or two in this video. Can I tell you my addiction lately? I mean, really, I've been so addicted
[249.61s -> 254.99s]  to a television show, the last week or so, I've watched every single episode and I can't
[254.99s -> 260.39s]  wait to see the movie now. In my Q&A a long time ago, I talked about Fullmetal Alchemist
[260.39s -> 265.43s]  and how I watched it. Not really a big anime person, but I did get into it and I did love
[265.43s -> 271.47s]  it. So I found out recently that they made a new one. They made a new Fullmetal Alchemist
[271.47s -> 275.83s]  Brotherhood. And I couldn't believe it. I was like, oh my God. And I actually remember
[275.83s -> 281.15s]  reading some comments on that Q&A video of people saying, you should watch the new FMA.
[281.15s -> 284.63s]  You should watch the new FMA. And I was like, what are you talking about? I remember looking
[284.63s -> 288.65s]  up stuff on it. And it looked like it was the same thing. I was like, did they just
[288.65s -> 295.65s]  remake this? But no, no, my God, it's a totally different story. It totally follows the comments
[295.85s -> 300.17s]  or the manga, I think is what it's called. And it is amazing. I got to tell you, if you
[300.17s -> 305.13s]  are an anime fan or you like anime at all, go watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.
[305.13s -> 311.67s]  It is really, really good. And when I say I, I mean we, me and Burger Boy have watched
[311.67s -> 317.27s]  every single episode. And we've also trying to get tickets to go to the movie in Boston.
[317.27s -> 321.27s]  I think it opens April 12th or something like that. So that should be fun. And that's just
[321.43s -> 326.79s]  I've been totally addicted to lately. The characters, the story, everything is so good.
[326.79s -> 330.71s]  I think it's better than the first one. If you were a fan of the first one, watch the
[330.71s -> 334.66s]  second one and then tell me you don't like the second one more. And I guess a follow
[334.66s -> 338.82s]  up to this would be in the comment section, if you know any other animes that are really
[338.82s -> 343.30s]  good that I would enjoy, if I like Fullmetal Alchemist, leave me a comment of a different
[343.30s -> 348.80s]  anime I would like. And I'll tell you to preface that, to preface that, I'm not big into anime
[348.80s -> 354.80s]  and I don't really like the goofy type anime where everyone's always like screaming and
[354.80s -> 359.12s]  yelling and like laughing and stuff like that. I like the serious type of anime where, you know,
[359.12s -> 364.72s]  there's like blood and fight scenes and characters and stuff. I'm not a big fan of the, let's just
[364.72s -> 370.94s]  say like the Sailor Moon type anime. But yeah, that's going to wrap up this video guys. Thank
[370.94s -> 375.18s]  you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And I will check you guys all next time.
[375.18s -> 377.98s]  So take care, everybody.
