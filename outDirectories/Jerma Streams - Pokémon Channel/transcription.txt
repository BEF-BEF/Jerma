[2437.35s -> 2445.12s]  Lot of money I don't have that much money. Sorry Pikachu. No, I can't afford it
[2464.76s -> 2486.79s]  What happens when you watch every TV channel, I don't have any money I need money but ring girl is gonna get you
[2487.55s -> 2497.71s]  quizzes, okay
[2501.10s -> 2506.73s]  Oh, it's a guy from a special way. No, it's not
[2508.41s -> 2512.15s]  This is the character that looks like that
[2513.87s -> 2521.69s]  Lucario is what he looks like. He's got the same scheme as the wrestler of Pokemon in sinner in sinner
[2530.25s -> 2540.42s]  All right, now we're gonna watch the quiz show quiz channel and we're gonna do quizzes for money
[2540.50s -> 2549.56s]  How do we play though do I get you can I like call do I have to like put my face up to it

[2575.32s -> 2580.58s]  Commander is in the lead. I'm sorry. No, never mind
[2589.01s -> 2595.10s]  Pokemon like a piece of chocolate who will take the chance?
[2595.10s -> 2603.02s]  Oh
[2605.47s -> 2609.99s]  It's underneath it I thought that was like a hook or or like a bottom
[2615.92s -> 2622.39s]  Peek-a-boo quiz. How do we even answer these correctly? Oh, so I see it now

[2634.93s -> 2646.72s]  How do we how do I go on this show? That's the one from smash probably
[2649.16s -> 2659.46s]  There's no winner. I want to get on this show. Maybe I can get
[2664.65s -> 2672.72s]  Bulbasaur Bulbasaur
[2674.72s -> 2691.83s]  We did it, okay now it's time for no more TV that we watched every show
[2694.59s -> 2697.19s]  Pikachu we watched every show that we have and
[2698.39s -> 2700.39s]  Sadly enough. We only have
[2700.87s -> 2703.51s]  seven full television shows available to us
[2704.23s -> 2738.73s]  It wants to watch anime part one. What anime part one and we already saw this I'm dumb going
[2739.29s -> 2741.37s]  You really are like a fucking five-year-old
[2741.97s -> 2743.69s]  You guys don't know
[2743.69s -> 2749.98s]  Kids love watching the same episode. They've seen of a TV show a thousand times like if you DVR
[2750.60s -> 2752.60s]  the same episode of
[2752.60s -> 2754.16s]  Mickey Mouse Clubhouse
[2754.16s -> 2758.33s]  Little kids will want to watch the same one every fucking day. So this does not surprise me at all
[2759.05s -> 2763.33s]  And eventually it gets to the point where you can you can say every line of the whole show
[2763.85s -> 2765.83s]  for instance
[2765.83s -> 2767.83s]  the episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse
[2767.91s -> 2774.05s]  Where Goofy doesn't know how to bake a cake. I know every line I could recite the whole thing
[2777.61s -> 2781.71s]  Yeah, I don't want to watch this
[2796.38s -> 2799.00s]  We don't watch the whole thing though
[2800.00s -> 2804.24s]  He's sad about this. All right, that was fun
[2808.43s -> 2810.43s]  He's gonna want to watch this every day
[2819.31s -> 2822.79s]  This is just babysitting well, let me make it more accurate
[2830.83s -> 2835.07s]  Sometimes fight and that's when they turn the whole world upside down
[2836.15s -> 2853.23s]  Bros like these can't stay mad for long in no time. They're back
[2855.99s -> 2857.99s]  It's Pichu and Pichu
[2860.93s -> 2862.93s]  See one without the other
[2863.73s -> 2869.21s]  Perfect pal stick brother to brother side by side. It's Pichu and Pichu
[2869.21s -> 2875.57s]  Well, it seems like the Pichu brothers and their friends are ready for another day of fun at their Pokemon Clubhouse
[2882.40s -> 2883.32s]  Oh
[2883.32s -> 2885.32s]  Sounds like smoochums got a problem
[2887.12s -> 2893.20s]  Smoochums all excited Pokemon are carrying little cards and they're shaped like a crescent moon
[2899.92s -> 2901.92s]  Oh
[2908.88s -> 2922.05s]  This sounds very interesting so the other Pokemon want to see for themselves
[2967.19s -> 2970.15s]  Honey honey, honey, don't put that in your mouth. Don't put that in your mouth
[2981.64s -> 2984.01s]  Oh

[3047.36s -> 3056.47s]  It's a lot of work. Shout out to all the fucking moms and dads out there. Oh, but we got it
[3056.47s -> 3058.47s]  We got to get you off fucking TV. I
[3063.76s -> 3065.92s]  Had the mic unmuted when I first came in

[3090.20s -> 3093.96s]  No, no more no more no more of that here, okay
[3095.59s -> 3108.46s]  Phineas and Ferb we just watched this whole thing

[3145.22s -> 3148.54s]  one of these watch TV and report back things
[3149.22s -> 3152.22s]  They literally make you wear a device in your house
[3152.86s -> 3157.20s]  like like an ankle bracelet if you were on like house arrest and
[3157.36s -> 3162.73s]  It kid fucking keeps you on there and attracts everything that you've ever do
[3163.37s -> 3171.73s]  It's like we want to be able to catch what like network you're on at any second and you have to wear it you have
[3171.73s -> 3173.17s]  To have it on at all times
[3173.17s -> 3178.22s]  How do I know this?

[3187.69s -> 3192.69s]  Decided maybe we would try this that sounds interesting and once we found out what we had to do
[3192.81s -> 3197.85s]  And we found that we were gonna have to wear these like weird fucking devices. It was like I
[3198.41s -> 3201.29s]  Don't think we want to do this anymore

[10520.59s -> 10523.54s]  Like that get the egg right

[10552.94s -> 10570.16s]  I mean, I missed it. I plagiarized this. Oh, oh, it's just he has Garfield
[10570.60s -> 10575.50s]  Pokemons this section is pretty cool
[10576.26s -> 10578.83s]  It's all
[10578.83s -> 10579.99s]  Pokemon
[10579.99s -> 10587.11s]  This is really really really this is very interesting
[10587.71s -> 10596.12s]  Same one that I drew with the lightsabers and everything. No, I don't see anything
[10596.80s -> 10614.32s]  Wait, where is this? I'm trying to find it with like the cigarette coming out of the mouth and the lightsabers
[10614.72s -> 10634.19s]  Well, you got it there is I want to see this is that's fucking hilarious. Okay, I'm not clicking on any more links
[10634.55s -> 10659.67s]  I'm not clicking on any more links. I was like that was that's gonna fuck me up for life. Check the art channel
[10659.67s -> 10672.74s]  What are you talking about? You ruined it? Oh, okay. I thought you talked about like the art channel on the website
[10673.14s -> 10702.32s]  Yeah, you guys got some fucked up images. I'm not I'm not there's nothing gonna be here. Wait a minute. What I didn't sell this
[10702.62s -> 10711.96s]  But even everybody I'm your host smuggle
[10715.91s -> 10725.02s]  Where are you getting this definite
[10726.50s -> 10727.70s]  Quiet
[10727.70s -> 10731.22s]  the decisiveness is
[10732.42s -> 10738.70s]  Losing with originality the artist demonstrates an original creative vision unseen in others. See it's an original character
[10738.70s -> 10744.22s]  It's not anything related to Disney or or Jim Davis. Neither one of those original
[10747.46s -> 10748.66s]  OC
[10748.66s -> 10773.50s]  This is a repost. What the fuck mods? I can't believe you like I like the fuck you one
[10774.86s -> 10780.81s]  All right, I think I'm done. I think I'm done. I think I'm done. I think I'm out of here
[10780.81s -> 10788.54s]  I think this is I think this is where I have this day as be done. I can't I don't think I can handle this anymore
[10789.26s -> 10803.11s]  Save the game. I'll save it. He hates this what I mean, I don't didn't say that. I don't hate this we talking about
[10803.67s -> 10818.62s]  He's never gonna watch TV with Pikachu ever again to find a rating on this game
[10818.62s -> 10823.10s]  I mean the video game is a tube
[10823.62s -> 10828.34s]  But like it's like the interesting the fun factor is like an eight
[10829.02s -> 10832.68s]  so I mean
[10832.68s -> 10842.08s]  It's fun. It's like funny and it's it's a wholesome. It's just watching TV with Pikachu
[10842.08s -> 10849.34s]  I give it as I give it up. I get a seven. I give it a seven for
[10850.02s -> 10878.82s]  On the moon. Who is it? I wouldn't pay attention. What are you gonna do? What am I playing switch?
[10878.82s -> 10880.82s]  I'm gonna play Animal Crossing when it comes out
[10880.98s -> 10884.37s]  All right, just turn it off
[10884.41s -> 10894.79s]  Thank you. Turn it off. Let me just like spell this one more time. Okay, I'm gonna save it
[10894.79s -> 10900.10s]  I'm fucking gonna get some food. Somebody said pizza like an hour and a half ago. It's their fault
[10902.66s -> 10913.99s]  Somebody said pizza like an hour an hour and a half ago and now it's your fault. Toxic paint cube
[10918.18s -> 10921.56s]  The new programs are scheduled to begin at uh today at 5 a.m
[10921.96s -> 10937.98s]  Because I can't report I can't skip ahead. I'm soft-walled. I have to go back and then go forward
[10938.86s -> 10950.41s]  Everyone you spent like two hours on one level of pinball game. I don't like to remember
[10955.37s -> 10959.83s]  How'd she get up there
[10960.11s -> 10965.66s]  He's saying
[10973.93s -> 10975.01s]  Nintendo
[10975.01s -> 10985.96s]  You said you'd eat the disk. I'm not gonna eat this. All right, I'll see you guys later
[10986.64s -> 10991.48s]  So plan is tomorrow on tomorrow. I'm probably gonna
[10992.48s -> 10999.23s]  Do tomorrow well, I want to you're gonna hate this you're gonna hate this but um, I
[11001.75s -> 11013.90s]  Know you a lot of you guys don't hate this. I want to uh, I'm I want to play Binding of Isaac again
[11013.90s -> 11018.04s]  You're gonna hate this
[11018.04s -> 11025.31s]  Again, I'm like addicted to it. I want to like play it so bad. I so badly want to play it
[11025.31s -> 11031.74s]  I'm like it. I've scratched the itch and now it's like I want to play I'm gonna play Binding of Isaac again tomorrow
[11031.98s -> 11046.28s]  He's addicted either that or
[11048.20s -> 11050.72s]  There's one other thing that I might do as well
[11051.36s -> 11054.42s]  It depends on what uh, it depends on how I feel
[11055.02s -> 11071.48s]  Not Nancy Drew. Oh you fucking liar
[11072.12s -> 11078.15s]  We'll see. I'm not sure yet, but I do want to play at least at least
[11078.95s -> 11082.79s]  Like two to four hours of Binding of Isaac tomorrow
[11082.83s -> 11088.35s]  We'll do something else but I want at least four hours of Binding of Isaac tomorrow or two hours at least at least
[11088.55s -> 11102.48s]  Two hours, you understand? I'm compromising with you. That's a whole screen. That's not two hours
[11102.94s -> 11116.94s]  It's like 20% of a stream like 30% of one stream two hour
[11116.94s -> 11125.42s]  But my average stream time is like six to eight hours two to three hours is like 20 to 40 percent like 30%
[11126.06s -> 11128.55s]  I'm playing it. That's all there is to it
[11133.24s -> 11135.24s]  You said four to six
[11135.24s -> 11143.58s]  I said two to four but play purple place look at like what you can't even play that game
[11143.58s -> 11156.67s]  That's like that games undown loadable. Yes, you can I don't think you guys want me to play purple place
[11156.87s -> 11164.04s]  That's funny for five seconds and then oh, no, he's playing fucking purple place. I'm gonna leave
[11164.04s -> 11178.27s]  I'll go do something else for like an hour. All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow. We'll do a couple things tomorrow. Let's say
[11179.15s -> 11186.13s]  When it's German crap
[11188.46s -> 11198.33s]  Within the next hundred years I'm not gonna destroy this he's like fun in cute games are like collectibles
[11198.33s -> 11202.25s]  I don't care if I didn't like the game not this one the one before it
[11202.25s -> 11205.17s]  I actually like the one before it but I was gonna eat the disc in my anger
[11206.51s -> 11211.03s]  He's a cool that nicely the collect. Look at like eat of this. I'm not gonna break anything
[11214.93s -> 11216.93s]  Wendy's Wendy's I
[11220.73s -> 11223.73s]  Don't I don't get this what what does that have to do with anything?
[11224.01s -> 11234.10s]  What does this Wendy's image have to do with anything? It's because I hit the mic. Oh
[11236.54s -> 11240.92s]  God damn it. Okay, let's go back to a little bit earlier today
[11242.19s -> 11246.87s]  Almost just about six and a half hours ago. We had dark soul 250 from dark soul
[11247.51s -> 11250.75s]  Here's some sober bits last night was something anyway
[11250.75s -> 11252.75s]  I do like whiskey a lot not more than vodka
[11252.91s -> 11256.19s]  But Jamison equals good Johnny Walker equals cigars and assholes
[11256.43s -> 11262.26s]  Let's think about opinions everyone's got just like how
[11262.86s -> 11272.13s]  You have one too. We should do 50 lm man. Thanks for the five dollars
[11272.65s -> 11283.94s]  Sound the call to war Shogun German and some opinions are wrong say every say assholes
[11284.86s -> 11295.26s]  You thought that's the thing. You thought I was gonna say that next part. Nope. Thanks with the five dollars lm, man
[11295.54s -> 11304.21s]  Hey yen when thanks for the 250. It is my birthday today. Happy birthday yen when
[11305.84s -> 11309.12s]  I'm almost as old as you but younger by a few years
[11309.40s -> 11312.38s]  So you're in the post you're in the post 30, you know
[11312.38s -> 11316.76s]  It's like started drawing this in hopes that I would finish before my birthday, but I ran out of time
[11317.32s -> 11318.90s]  ran out of time
[11318.90s -> 11323.78s]  Hope that I could use this as a bribe in order to receive an exclusive rats birthday song
[11324.06s -> 11340.60s]  This is the sandwich. Is this like the dirty sandwich? Let's see. Yeah, it is
[11340.90s -> 11349.92s]  This is the dirty sandwich. I'm just show it on screen
[11350.52s -> 11354.31s]  Well dirty as an old as an old
[11354.95s -> 11376.02s]  Get it on here almost done. This is fucking really good
[11376.54s -> 11385.49s]  Yeah, that's the that's the turkey sandwich that sat in the car for like six and a half hours or in a day or something
[11385.81s -> 11401.14s]  The oblivion sandwich. Yeah, that's fucking incredible though. It's so good. It's so fucking good
[11401.68s -> 11408.18s]  Thank you for this and happy birthday and you want to spell you want to rats?
[11408.98s -> 11418.77s]  Let's see if I can get it here we go. Hey, happy birthday. Have a birthday again when
[11419.29s -> 11421.98s]  I'm the match me
[11422.26s -> 11437.08s]  Just found one. It is we just ran by it was pretty wild. That's kind of a problem
[11437.08s -> 11447.43s]  Where they coming in from but thank you again. Thanks for the insanely talented artwork. You got you got some skill here real skill
[11447.93s -> 11458.93s]  Happy birthday. Hope it's a good one. Oh shit. I lost my fucking I lost my stream. I lost my stream
[11459.57s -> 11464.47s]  There it is. Hey LM, man another five dolls from LM, man
[11466.88s -> 11470.76s]  Jerma sama with this legendary skill in leading an army of
[11471.52s -> 11476.16s]  Conscripted as she garu. Have you ever considered playing the total war Shogun games?
[11476.16s -> 11485.59s]  My brain is way too small for those. I'm capable of throwing a pinball against the wall and getting angry
[11485.59s -> 11490.78s]  I I do not have the patience to play any of those games like that
[11490.78s -> 11494.66s]  I've seen a lot of people say dude, you should play civilization. It would be so much fun
[11495.14s -> 11497.14s]  Man, you should check out
[11498.15s -> 11504.35s]  Europa, whatever it's called. Do you know what's it called your Europe? What's it called? What's that one called?
[11504.43s -> 11516.32s]  Is this like three of them, right? Yeah, Europa universe sales. Yeah, I've heard that I've heard
[11517.26s -> 11522.80s]  What's the other one? There's another one. That's really popular. What the hell is it called?
[11525.94s -> 11530.14s]  Crusader Kings that there it is. Yeah, those games take
[11530.60s -> 11534.80s]  Like dozens of hours to even understand how to play them correctly
[11535.08s -> 11540.80s]  I would get annoyed and bored and frustrated in the first four hours and it would be I
[11542.13s -> 11546.45s]  Couldn't I would just lose my mind. I just don't have the brain patience for games like that
[11547.01s -> 11552.67s]  Even on my own time something like that is like hey, you wanna play Crusader Kings. I'd be like no
[11553.41s -> 11560.29s]  No, not in a million years. Like I wouldn't even do that on my own time even like it before streaming
[11560.53s -> 11573.12s]  That's something I just wouldn't play. I need to throw rocks at people. I mean
[11573.40s -> 11580.94s]  I gotta roll a pinball rock into a guy. That's that's pretty much what you saw today was the extent of most of the
[11581.56s -> 11587.99s]  Strategy games you'll see me play on this channel. What about stronghold 2?
[11588.51s -> 11597.31s]  Total war Warhammer total Warhammer 2 is easy to learn maybe but we're talking about me
[11597.73s -> 11601.23s]  We are talking about me
[11601.23s -> 11609.62s]  But probably not you'll you'll probably never see a game like that on this channel and that's when I could be really certain of
[11613.09s -> 11618.49s]  Wembley TTV, thanks for the 250 if you want to play a better voice-activated military game find a copy of Tom Clancy and war
[11618.49s -> 11624.01s]  I don't think the PC steam version is voice-activated though. So find a ps3 or Xbox free
[11624.65s -> 11631.66s]  Xbox version if you want to try it. I love microphone games. They're fun
[11635.73s -> 11640.05s]  General ours. Thanks for the fourteen dollars fourteen hundred bits from general ours, Germany
[11640.05s -> 11648.56s]  Where did you get that flint water? What do you mean flint water? Is that what they have on the shelves are you talking about?
[11649.00s -> 11668.08s]  I'm drinking coffee. I'm drinking coffee. It's coffee. It's not it's not
[11669.20s -> 11684.42s]  It's coffee. It's good. I like it. No, but they're nothing on the shelves anymore. That's why I've got I got that
[11684.42s -> 11692.76s]  Hey, I bought some of this Fiji water cuz it's the only thing that fucking was existed people go buy all the
[11693.20s -> 11701.91s]  Regular bottled water and they just and they leave the Fiji like a shit like I gotta buy like a case of Fiji
[11702.09s -> 11716.29s]  There's nobody's gonna buy the case of Fiji. It's good though. I mean, I love this stuff. It's great
[11716.41s -> 11724.60s]  It's really good, but I don't don't really want to buy cases of it. Anyways
[11725.76s -> 11729.40s]  Desoids Dutch capture, but thanks for the thousand bits new drinking game
[11729.40s -> 11734.72s]  Take a shot every time German says press forward. I would advise against doing that
[11735.68s -> 11744.88s]  Definitely, but it's not a good idea would advise against doing that
[11746.77s -> 11751.43s]  Sir linkerton, thanks with five dollars. Hey German glad to make it to a stream usually watch on YouTube
[11751.75s -> 11755.71s]  Thanks for giving us all a distraction from the scary times. The world is in right now
[11756.03s -> 11760.90s]  Would there be another keep talking stream with Joel? Oh, probably not
[11761.10s -> 11763.70s]  We'll probably move on to something else if we ever play something again
[11764.02s -> 11768.98s]  If we ever ever monkey ash German Pluto if we ever why do you say that ever does that mean?
[11768.98s -> 11773.74s]  He means he's never gonna play with him again. He must hate Joel. I think he hates Joel. I think he hates Joel
[11773.98s -> 11776.22s]  He said ever
[11776.22s -> 11779.32s]  Yeah, so we'll probably when we ever do something again
[11780.24s -> 11785.62s]  I'll probably do something else new games come out. They're worth playing
[11791.34s -> 11803.53s]  He punched Joel I did not do that I didn't do that you're a liar and you're making that up new games aren't coming out
[11803.53s -> 11806.65s]  Yes, they are. It was like three or four new games coming out over the next
[11807.29s -> 11819.46s]  Few months a furry. Oh, I missed this. This is a lot of money Freudian weapon. Thanks for the $40
[11820.48s -> 11826.64s]  4,000 bits from Freudian weapon. That's that's just shy of fucking $50, dude. Thank you
[11827.12s -> 11833.96s]  Doom and Resident Evil 3 got delayed off. Really? It's unfortunate
[11834.32s -> 11836.26s]  They say hey Jerma
[11836.26s -> 11840.02s]  I just want to say that I appreciate you streaming things are getting kind of scary in the world as you know
[11840.34s -> 11845.22s]  The fact that I can still tune into your streams with some laughs definitely helps bring so much needed comfort. Thanks so much
[11845.90s -> 11853.09s]  Love you in chat. Yes, wash your hands everyone. Yes
[11853.69s -> 11858.50s]  Take some precautions when you do anything when you go anywhere
[11859.02s -> 11863.79s]  Try to limit the amount that you go out
[11864.19s -> 11870.16s]  To especially the places that have a lot of people in them, especially if you're in an area that you know, I've seen
[11871.41s -> 11876.29s]  Cases there's some countries that are in lockdown right now. Just be careful and be smart
[11876.57s -> 11887.38s]  Yeah, well, like I said the other day and yesterday too. Hopefully this blows over pretty soon
[11887.66s -> 11890.02s]  hopefully we can get ahead of this because
[11891.56s -> 11896.95s]  It's been a while since something like this has happened, right?
[11896.95s -> 11905.68s]  What was the last the last big kind of scary pandemic was but h1 h1 n1 stars or something
[11905.80s -> 11915.38s]  But not this big. Yeah, 2003 Ebola, but I don't think Ebola was this
[11916.93s -> 11922.03s]  Widespread around what was I don't think I don't remember it being like that. Was it not that I remember
[11922.03s -> 11926.05s]  I mean like Disney World is closed. That's
[11926.65s -> 11930.44s]  Not that's not even close to what how scary, you know
[11930.82s -> 11935.88s]  Well that not even what I mean not even close like they're they closed Disney World
[11936.24s -> 11943.80s]  Disney World has never been closed ever in the history of it ever being opened except for only think I think two or three days
[11943.92s -> 11950.71s]  So this is I guess enough to have to warrant doing something like that
[11951.03s -> 11955.11s]  Last time Disney World was closed was on 9-eleven
[11955.11s -> 11974.14s]  I mean that you don't just close it just I mean the whole park is you can't even go but like
[11974.96s -> 11978.84s]  Hopefully this is all over soon and we can kind of get back to normal over the next few months
[11979.04s -> 11984.12s]  When summertime kind of really rolls around here, especially in the US hopefully
[11984.97s -> 11997.29s]  Cases die down and it can you know, we can move on. Hope so, but be careful Saints got robbed
[11997.33s -> 12002.96s]  Thanks for the five dollars just five dollars. Thank you Saints got robbed all the list goes
[12002.96s -> 12008.68s]  Thanks for the three dollars and watching your constant since 2011
[12008.72s -> 12014.11s]  Your streams have helped me get through a lot of rough patches, especially recently also your now
[12014.55s -> 12020.23s]  Withered muscles helped encourage me to get fucking huge while I'm still somewhat young though lately
[12020.23s -> 12025.75s]  I've been eating a tahini paste and doing bicep curls for YouTube sub celebrations and I never felt better about myself
[12026.62s -> 12030.62s]  Thank you for the near decade of content and for always striving to be the best gamer
[12030.74s -> 12036.80s]  You can be much love. Good luck to you. I never condoned that I never told you to anybody to do that
[12036.80s -> 12040.52s]  Do not do that. Are you doing that on your own? Good luck. Thank you

[12127.65s -> 12132.29s]  Luke used Anakin's blue saber and he made his own saber, which was green shaking my head

[12226.92s -> 12228.38s]  No, okay
[12228.38s -> 12235.55s]  It's that is a nice cold brew that coffee that I'm drinking is a is a cold brew that you keep in the fridge
[12236.51s -> 12242.23s]  The reason why I look so gross is because I put almond milk in it and I sit here and I drink it and I sip
[12242.23s -> 12248.58s]  On it for an hour and what happens is the almond milk separates from the coffee and looks like shit
[12248.70s -> 12253.24s]  It's not the coffee. It's the almond milk. I'm putting in it, but I like almond milk
[12253.24s -> 12260.68s]  I like putting on the milk in my coffee. Oh, that's why it looks like that. It's a nice cold brew
[12260.68s -> 12273.38s]  What you're seeing why not mix it with a spoon because I don't have a spoon up in my office in fucking quotes
[12273.86s -> 12277.92s]  I don't have a spoon up here. I mean I got what kind of have us
[12277.92s -> 12287.84s]  What am I gonna put what I'm gonna do with it? I'm not gonna put my finger in it. No, that's gross
[12288.12s -> 12294.52s]  Hey frozen Thor 516. Thanks for the 250. Hey German. Thanks for the stream as usual
[12294.52s -> 12296.52s]  You said you never played any of the Pokemon games before
[12297.12s -> 12302.46s]  What if you consider playing them perhaps the new one that came out for the switch with silly rules such as chat picks
[12302.46s -> 12310.30s]  What Pokemon you can use something like that again? Thanks for the stream and keep being awesome. I will try
[12310.74s -> 12320.08s]  Glad you think that right to drive better I can be better and always be better right? Um, I don't I home
[12320.08s -> 12322.08s]  I don't really want to play Pokemon
[12323.02s -> 12324.38s]  Pokemon is
[12324.38s -> 12330.06s]  It's cool. I respect the franchise, but I don't have in any interest in it at all
[12330.06s -> 12337.11s]  I really don't zero like unless it's a TV game or like take pictures with Pikachu
[12337.11s -> 12344.29s]  I don't actually really care at all about the main line Pokemon game
[12344.29s -> 12353.12s]  I just never have and I never do and I never will it's just the way it is. Sorry. It's the way it is
[12353.12s -> 12363.64s]  But thank you for the suggestion silent serenity. Thanks for the 250 as others have said, I'm glad you chill here with
[12364.16s -> 12369.08s]  I'm glad to chill here with you guys while we're quarantined video games are a great time killer
[12369.08s -> 12373.88s]  I've been playing the city skylines over the past couple of days and I definitely recommend it for wasting time
[12373.88s -> 12376.32s]  I actually planned on streaming city skylines
[12376.36s -> 12386.44s]  Should I we talked about that a few weeks ago like a month or two ago, right that be fun
[12386.44s -> 12391.29s]  Could I can I handle that I want to be very clear about this
[12391.53s -> 12398.76s]  Can I handle that like can I handle that one? Absolutely not. Yes, do it tomorrow
[12399.04s -> 12404.82s]  Can I fucking handle that? Is that like a I get to sit there and learn the whole game for like 12 hours
[12404.82s -> 12417.44s]  It's easier than sim City doesn't take that long. It's good. There's some systems kind of need to learn
[12417.44s -> 12430.32s]  It's 30 minutes to learn for it's easy to pick up. It's easy. It's super simple. Okay. Okay, we'll do it tomorrow
[12430.52s -> 12442.44s]  All right, we'll do it tomorrow. We'll play city skylines tomorrow, but I'm getting my I'm getting my fucking couple hours of binding of eyes again
[12445.44s -> 12454.12s]  We'll do that tomorrow. And that's the end. Thanks for watching. We'll see you tomorrow. Same time around
[12454.64s -> 12458.41s]  3 4 p.m. Pacific and
[12458.89s -> 12462.89s]  Goodbye and good night
[12462.89s -> 12467.91s]  Sergio but right at the end 250 got back from work to see you still stream and I had a co-worker act totally normal
[12467.91s -> 12473.71s]  I'll shift and start violently coughing into the trash can next to him. Jesus. I told him. Hey, I love you
[12473.71s -> 12480.21s]  But please don't cough on the line. We had to decontaminate the entire kitchen mid shift. That's shit scary
[12480.35s -> 12483.99s]  Glad I could share a laugh after today today. That's not good
[12484.35s -> 12490.91s]  It's gotta be careful. I mean at that here's the thing though
[12491.27s -> 12500.80s]  There's there's there's there's like coughing and sneezing and there's like normal stuff and it's like is that what's what's wrong with that person?
[12500.80s -> 12503.16s]  You don't want to get too
[12503.48s -> 12509.20s]  Too into it and to like hysteria, you know, I mean that that's how it's somebody just sneezed in this in this place
[12509.20s -> 12513.28s]  I am I gotta get the fuck out of here. You know what I mean? You just gotta be careful
[12513.28s -> 12517.76s]  We it's it's a like the web jacket just said it's allergy season 2
[12518.08s -> 12520.00s]  so
[12520.00s -> 12524.20s]  There is enough to be concerned about for sure
[12524.48s -> 12532.40s]  But we just we got to be careful with I know it's scary and it's it's not a fun time for really anybody
[12532.60s -> 12540.96s]  But we don't also want to feed into the like the absolute hysteria, but you never know
[12540.96s -> 12546.84s]  I know but I know but still but it's the same reason you got people buying 30 fucking
[12547.08s -> 12552.27s]  rolls of toilet paper like they like I've seen the images of people that got like a
[12552.55s -> 12561.87s]  Full a full closet of like 5,000 rolls of toilet paper. It's like that's that's all that's a lot. That's a lot
[12562.51s -> 12570.42s]  People buy like 10 gallons of milk like milk goes bad in like not even 12 days, right?
[12570.46s -> 12573.36s]  Like what are you buying 10 gallons of milk?
[12573.88s -> 12580.87s]  Who's gonna drink all that milk in the next like week or two? Just freeze it
[12580.87s -> 12585.96s]  But what people people are freezing milk?
[12588.49s -> 12590.45s]  If I ever put milk in my freezer
[12590.45s -> 12601.62s]  I'm gonna freeze nine gallons of milk and you got like the people that are buying all this shit
[12601.62s -> 12606.65s]  And then they're selling it on like the internet for like fucking a thousand percent more
[12606.65s -> 12611.29s]  It's like God if people are just trying to get like a one stack of toilet paper
[12611.29s -> 12614.53s]  Now you're talking about they might have to it's not there because everyone's been
[12614.69s -> 12619.33s]  Panicking and buying it all and you got these guys that have going in there and buying it to sell it to those people that
[12619.33s -> 12621.33s]  Didn't get there in time at like a
[12621.85s -> 12626.37s]  20,000 percent premium it's like Jesus
[12626.37s -> 12629.77s]  I always end up in like a pandemic aren't we supposed to like help each other
[12630.25s -> 12634.65s]  You know I'm saying like that's that that seems a little strange
[12639.82s -> 12645.66s]  No, I feel the same. Okay
[12646.22s -> 12651.54s]  When there was like a baseball game or something and it's like, oh, maybe like three or four of us will go to the game
[12651.54s -> 12657.26s]  Oh, okay. Yeah, how about your tickets? Oh, there are none left. Oh, there are no more tickets left
[12657.30s -> 12660.54s]  Oh looks like we're gonna walk out to the front of fucking Fenway Park
[12661.14s -> 12665.23s]  Hey, I got tickets for you 200 bucks for the fucking nosebleeds
[12665.75s -> 12677.90s]  Okay, thanks cool. But what's that again? Those those are like those are like forty one dollar seats
[12683.57s -> 12684.97s]  boomer ball
[12684.97s -> 12691.43s]  You're with a communist
[12691.43s -> 12695.72s]  What that's what that does not communist?
[12697.38s -> 12699.38s]  seeing people but

[12711.78s -> 12713.18s]  Hey
[12713.18s -> 12715.38s]  Sorry, excuse me ma'am and sir
[12715.38s -> 12721.48s]  I'm a communist and I don't agree with the fact you have your whole entire fucking Subaru outback full of toilet paper
[12722.06s -> 12728.02s]  That's not that's not the one it is
[12738.74s -> 12744.62s]  He's going on a socialist rant. No, I have not that's not what that is not even close
[12745.10s -> 12752.70s]  No, don't twist it. Don't twist it on me. Don't twist it. Don't twist it on me. Don't twist it
[12752.70s -> 12760.18s]  I don't want to hear from any of you starting to twist. What's happening to me? What's going on?
[12761.18s -> 12764.52s]  Don't twist don't I don't want anybody to twist this on what's happening?
[12770.06s -> 12775.81s]  Sorry, I had something all right, I don't want you don't twist it on me. That's not what I was saying
[12776.21s -> 12783.63s]  Anyways, have a great day. Have a great rest of your night
[12785.81s -> 12791.92s]  Go very juice. Thanks for 250 right at the buzzer here. No, like for real German. It's okay. You can admit that you farted
[12798.69s -> 12803.05s]  We all do it there's no reason to be embarrassed about it
[12803.05s -> 12808.37s]  I mean not all of us part live on stream in front of thousands of people a small percentage of which may be
[12809.17s -> 12815.25s]  Into farts. I mean that would be fucking embarrassing, but you know, it's okay if you do. Why did I read that out loud?
[12817.28s -> 12818.78s]  Okay
[12818.78s -> 12823.08s]  Goodbye. Good night. See you tomorrow. Have a fucking wonderful rest of your evening
