[1.14s -> 12.42s]  Hi guys. Let's talk about this. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. I'm flustered already.
[13.24s -> 18.60s]  And I haven't even started anything. A little ill. I've been feeling ill. I've been watching TV.
[20.38s -> 25.10s]  But listen, I just found the dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen on a computer. And it's on
[25.10s -> 33.08s]  my computer. I own a computer and I found the worst thing ever. All the shit that I talk about. Oh,
[33.08s -> 36.76s]  I can't believe this. This person has this. Can't believe this company. I have the worst
[36.76s -> 46.07s]  computer case. I just found out why. Just in a moment, you'll find out. I'm gonna tweet that.
[46.07s -> 94.63s]  One second. All right. So I, as you guys know, I'm just your average Joe. I'm not a computer
[94.63s -> 100.86s]  scientist. I dabble in it sometimes. I think it's fun to build them. But here's the issue. I got a
[100.86s -> 108.06s]  USB cable. I have the USB front panel right on the top of my computer on the case is USBs. Four of
[108.06s -> 113.50s]  them. And then next to that is this thing called the power button, where you press it and your
[113.50s -> 118.94s]  computer turns on. Or if you hold it, you can force shut off. Everybody has power button. Okay.
[119.98s -> 126.70s]  If for some reason, directly next to the left of the power button is a reset button,
[127.66s -> 136.89s]  and it is touch sensitive. I didn't, I just found this out. I'm trying to plug in my USB from my
[136.97s -> 144.44s]  fucking Xbox controller. And I like slightly grazed this other little button right to the
[144.44s -> 151.40s]  right of that slot. And my computer reset. What is the, what does that, what function is that?
[152.95s -> 162.38s]  Why would you have a fucking Nintendo reset button on a PC? Is this a fucking Super Nintendo? Why is
[162.38s -> 174.87s]  that here? To reset the computer. No, it's a restart, not like a reset. That fucking thing.
[174.87s -> 180.63s]  No bullshit. Here's what that thing should be. Okay. Shouldn't be a button that you can just
[180.63s -> 186.63s]  like slightly graze and then it's a meme audio. You're trying to turn on the fucking Nintendo.
[186.63s -> 193.03s]  No, no, no. Have that be a hole where you can stick a fucking pin in like a actual reset button.
[194.62s -> 197.58s]  I can't fucking believe it. I turned my computer off. I was about to turn the stream on.
[198.52s -> 203.32s]  My computer restarted and I had to set everything back up again. Oh, I was fucking flustered.
[204.20s -> 218.90s]  Just don't press the button. What, but what, but why is it there? Fucking computer cases, man.
[219.54s -> 224.47s]  The things that just goddamn plastic and steel. That's what people want. Don't, you don't have to
[224.47s -> 229.75s]  add any frills. Just give me the good face plate and things made it a goddamn plastic and glass.
[230.55s -> 234.07s]  It's all right. You don't have to do that. Some fun buttons. How about this one is like the help
[234.07s -> 239.59s]  button. My keyboard. You got a keyboard. Look down right now at your keyboard. Does it have a help
[239.59s -> 253.00s]  button? Pry it off with pliers. Tonight we're going to play Celeste. As you can see on the
[253.00s -> 265.14s]  screen right now. There it is. Jeremy, are you okay right now? Yeah, I just, I couldn't believe it. I
[265.14s -> 269.46s]  couldn't believe that I accidentally restarted my computer because I tried to plug a USB in.
[270.18s -> 278.42s]  I hope you guys had a good few days. I haven't seen you guys in a little while.
[283.56s -> 292.73s]  Was not supposed to be off yesterday, but I was feeling fucking shitty physically.
[293.69s -> 298.41s]  And I really didn't think I was going to be able to sit here for, you know, three, four, five plus
[298.41s -> 305.21s]  hours. So, but I thought I should be okay today. I should be okay today. I mean, okay right now.
[305.21s -> 315.85s]  Yeah. You can always tell my level of health by the old person rant that I do at the beginning of
[315.85s -> 323.54s]  the stream and how many swear words were in it. So I don't know. I have no idea what this game is
[323.54s -> 332.01s]  about. I know that it's a game about climbing up a mountain and I know it's a platformer.
[332.33s -> 337.70s]  I don't know. It's kind of like in the realm of Super Meat Boy. Am I wrong? Is this completely,
[337.70s -> 352.57s]  is this not even the right way to describe this game? Is this like Super Meat Boy? Kind of. Well,
[352.57s -> 357.54s]  let's find out. What do you say? I have been told, Jeremy, you have to turn the music up.
[357.54s -> 362.90s]  Otherwise I'm leaving. So we're going to turn it down a couple of notches and let's get the
[362.90s -> 371.19s]  sound in a good spot. Sounds about right. Ah, all right. Fine. We'll get it to five,
[371.99s -> 379.50s]  six and a five for the general average rating. This stream is probably going to get by the end
[379.50s -> 389.05s]  of the stream from the audience itself. Now let's climb. Did I choose, choose character?
[391.34s -> 397.83s]  Assist mode. Should I, what should I do about that? Should I keep the assist mode off? Rename.
[399.99s -> 419.85s]  Uh, keep it off. How about a series of numbers? Jax. Should it be Jax? I don't know. I've been
[419.85s -> 423.61s]  feeling kind of ill the last couple of days. I'm not sure Jax is going to make an appearance.
[423.61s -> 432.12s]  Jax is down in my like lower intestine right now, hiding. Is there like a, okay, is there a
[432.12s -> 442.71s]  mid-level Jax that we can try to figure out here? Cause Jax is like Super God. Jonks? Does that work?
[443.35s -> 468.36s]  How about just Jon? All right. Jonks. Jon. Just J-O-N. Jonks. Now I think it has to be Jon.
[474.68s -> 481.32s]  This Jerma, this Jax, and then his Jon. You guys don't want Jon. Let me just tell you.
[481.32s -> 500.20s]  If today's going to be a Jon day, this is it. Jon. Oh man. I can already tell I'm going to have
[500.20s -> 519.61s]  problems. Just breathe. Okay. I'll listen. Should I breathe out? Okay. What's wrong with my computer?
[520.25s -> 528.20s]  What is wrong? What's my computer doing? What's wrong with my computer? Whoa. What the fuck?
[533.69s -> 552.54s]  I got a virus. There must be a virus. All right. So press A to jump. Press B to jump. Press A to
[552.54s -> 565.98s]  jump. Press C to jump. Press B to jump. Oh, okay. This is not, how do I read? Is there a fast run?
[568.41s -> 579.99s]  If I hold down Super Meat Boy Y, hold LT to climb and then press up. Okay. That's not,
[580.55s -> 587.26s]  that's not bad. I will say I'm okay. Does right trigger do the same thing? It does. I would rather
[587.26s -> 597.37s]  do right trigger. He's asking a question in the tutorial. What? Just, just relax. Okay. Did you
[597.37s -> 605.13s]  breathe? Excuse me, ma'am. Do you want me to do, do you want me to do voice acting here?
[606.89s -> 611.50s]  The sign is busted. This, is this mountain, is this the mountain trail?
[614.26s -> 619.38s]  You're almost there. It's across the bridge.
[627.02s -> 635.46s]  Tell us about your driveway. The bridge collapsed and I nearly died.
[643.13s -> 648.28s]  My driveway almost did you in. The mountain might be a bit much for you.
[652.26s -> 656.10s]  Is Jerma doing the beeps? I don't know what, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[656.10s -> 657.78s]  My computer's making weird noises though.
[671.21s -> 675.93s]  Well, if I'm an old bat, like you can survive out here. Like I think you'll be, there's no likes.
[681.61s -> 686.25s]  Like if I'm an old bat and like, why am I doing that? But you should know Celeste mountain is a
[686.25s -> 699.51s]  strange place. You might see things, things you ain't ready to see. Uh, you should seek help lady.
[704.47s -> 721.99s]  That lady just did the Super Mario fucking theme song. She's still laughing at me.
[721.99s -> 746.04s]  Is the bridge going to collapse? Of course it should. Dash. Ah, there's a dash. Okay.
[747.00s -> 760.31s]  So X is dash. You can do this. I know. I mean, I know I can. You're talking to her.
[761.11s -> 769.93s]  You're talking to John. So there's a level select. Chapter one forsaken city. Climate.
[770.97s -> 776.73s]  Click save and quit from the pause menu at any time to take a break.
[777.45s -> 780.89s]  You resume from the same screen and you won't lose any progress. You know
[782.02s -> 790.17s]  when a video game gives you the we-mote take a break sun warning that you're probably going to
[790.17s -> 804.18s]  have to at some point cause it's going to be hard. Okay. Oh, I got to change that one because I'm
[804.18s -> 811.78s]  used to holding down that X or square button for a fast run. It's just the platform of blood that
[811.78s -> 818.10s]  runs through my veins. All of you know what I'm talking about. Holding down X, holding down Y
[818.10s -> 840.68s]  to just the run. Oh man. I'm good. I can go up or down. Jump. So what is that? A thousand points.
[841.56s -> 850.01s]  I don't know. Wait, I'm not done. Okay. I only got one. I'm like, ah, I only got one dash.
[850.73s -> 854.33s]  And when you're okay, when your hair is blue, you've used your dash. That's a really good
[854.33s -> 859.93s]  fucking high quality indicator to know that you did it. Can it go down? No, that's not down. All
[859.93s -> 868.95s]  right. Here we go. All right. I, I figured it out. You, there are Yakwas in this one.
[869.83s -> 889.59s]  There are Yakwas. Hmm. So I can go, uh, so is it just each stage is a different
[889.59s -> 901.05s]  Mega Man screen? Is that what I'm understanding? Straight up. Yes. Basically. Okay. That's cool.
[903.08s -> 907.14s]  What about down there? Is there a secret? Are there secrets in this game that I need to know about?
[908.10s -> 912.26s]  I already figured out the Yakwas. Okay. But I needed to know if there's other secrets.
[913.22s -> 926.42s]  Whoa, whoa, what happened? What's going on? You can only hold on for so long. Okay. I get it.
[927.61s -> 942.68s]  How long can you hold on long here? All right. I see nothing up in that little crevice.
[943.48s -> 955.21s]  Well, I guess we're just going to go. I just got baited. So these things, I can get those.
[956.33s -> 964.31s]  This is no jumping and this is no dashing. Not allowed. Oh, or it goes away. I get it.
[971.69s -> 979.43s]  Okay. You're going to give me a challenge here. Don't speak so soon. Don't speak so soon streamer.
[980.15s -> 1008.89s]  He doesn't even know. Just wait till he gets to the world too. Okay. Let's get the fruit. Oh,
[1011.32s -> 1016.60s]  carefully crafted. All right. So no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I got, I have a dash still.
[1016.60s -> 1021.03s]  Just don't use it until right now. So what do you, what do I get for the, uh,
[1021.91s -> 1039.02s]  the stroke, the snowberries? Is there like an upgrade feature? It's an ending. Don't tell me
[1039.02s -> 1045.40s]  the ending. I don't want to know the ending. Oh, here's the ending by the way. Oh my God.
[1046.20s -> 1058.12s]  What have you done? Uh, anonymous gifter anonymous just gave 20 community subs. Well, whoever you
[1058.12s -> 1070.06s]  are. Uh, thank you. Really appreciate it. That's a lot. That's fucking so much money. Thank you.
[1070.86s -> 1074.06s]  And congratulations to all the people that got a community sub. You can now put
[1074.06s -> 1079.58s]  emotes in the chat and not affected by slow mode and you don't get any ads and I don't play ads
[1079.58s -> 1085.24s]  on the stream anyways, but you know, all right, let's see. Can I look or should I just look around,
[1085.24s -> 1103.94s]  just explore? That's a death, right? Oh, there's a strawberry over there. Pay to win chat. Uh oh.
[1104.66s -> 1111.61s]  I'll figure it out. My brain is bigger than anyone's on earth. I can figure this out.
[1116.06s -> 1133.88s]  Uh, I think I need to go the other way. Oh shit. Okay. So you can actually, there's, there's physical
[1134.52s -> 1141.93s]  fitness movement in this. Okay. I get it. So you can actually use that stuff. Cool.
[1148.65s -> 1165.61s]  So that's a different little globe. Hmm. There's two of them as big as this gets. He's in one of
[1165.61s -> 1179.56s]  his moods, isn't he? The hell does that mean? Oh my God. Don't die again. No, don't. Oh my God.
[1179.56s -> 1201.06s]  I died again. I'm getting so angry at this game. Oh, does it count? No, I've got to complete the
[1201.06s -> 1212.01s]  level. Okay. He's happy now, but he won't be in a couple hours. Well then we're just going to have
[1212.01s -> 1225.61s]  to play GeoGuessr. Uh, the way I can get this. I have to go down and around. Look, this is a,
[1225.61s -> 1238.02s]  this is a Metroidvania. I'm going to unlock another ability. Maybe not. Hold on. I got it.
[1238.10s -> 1251.94s]  Another 10 community subs. 10 community subs from FergBernandes. Thank you. What?
[1252.66s -> 1269.37s]  Did I not get it? Huh? That's a speed run feature, isn't it? I got to get them both
[1270.17s -> 1273.43s]  in like five seconds. Whatever. This guy will tell me what to do.
[1281.50s -> 1283.34s]  No, you've heard it already. I'm not going to do it again.
[1285.34s -> 1290.42s]  What a killer night for a hike. I guess so.
[1290.42s -> 1301.22s]  Read chat. Read chat. Read chat. No. All right. Fine. This place is so crazy. I kind of can't,
[1301.22s -> 1304.02s]  really is the same noise though. I mean, you got to give me credit for even fucking,
[1304.02s -> 1307.78s]  give me some credit here. I didn't fucking know that this was going to happen.
[1309.30s -> 1314.55s]  I had no fucking idea. I just, you can ask anybody in this house. I just said,
[1314.55s -> 1320.95s]  I'm going to use this on stream today. And, but I mean, it's my computer making that noise. So
[1320.95s -> 1327.91s]  I mean, I'm going to use my computer on stream. Not the easiest climb, is it? But I guess that's
[1327.91s -> 1337.64s]  what I was looking for. Well, that sounds pretty serious. I'm just happy to see another human in
[1337.64s -> 1342.92s]  such a lonely place. It's the same fucking sound. I can't get over it. I'm not going to be able to
[1342.92s -> 1355.66s]  the whole time. Theo, by the way, an adventure from a far off land. It's not much of a talker,
[1355.66s -> 1361.42s]  are you? Serious lone wolf type. I get it. I just imagined some dark backstory for you.
[1362.70s -> 1367.96s]  This is where I bring my souls and I'm thinking, I'm thinking like a Dex build,
[1367.96s -> 1372.04s]  maybe a little bit of endurance, some vitality, and then stack resistance.
[1380.34s -> 1386.74s]  Dex, look, there's a fire here and there's an NPC in this little camp over there. Give me a break.
[1387.62s -> 1390.66s]  Well, John, I'd say you've come to the right place. I'm freezing my toes off,
[1390.66s -> 1392.98s]  but I can't imagine a better place for some quiet reflection.
[1394.50s -> 1400.66s]  Maybe you're right. Wait, what far off land do you hail from? Well, my inquisitive compatriot,
[1400.66s -> 1405.38s]  I don't hail from the mystical. It's going to be like Ohio or something. The mystical exotic kingdom
[1405.38s -> 1416.36s]  of Seattle. Got you. I wrote this. No, I did. No, I did. I did. No, I did. No, I did. Sounds like a
[1416.36s -> 1426.25s]  special place. Hey, okay. Anything else? Why would an entire city be abandoned?
[1427.53s -> 1431.53s]  I read that some mega corporations started building it, but then no one wanted to live here.
[1432.49s -> 1439.29s]  I wonder why. My money's on a government cover-up. What a waste to build all this for no reason.
[1441.13s -> 1449.51s]  At least we get to enjoy the leftovers. All right, thanks for the war.
[1449.91s -> 1459.78s]  Oh, my meat boy instincts are making me just jump off walls, and it's annoying me. This is blocked.
[1464.52s -> 1471.16s]  Keep talking. Are you here to explore this city? Yeah, I have a thing for abandoned places,
[1471.16s -> 1477.56s]  and I like to think of myself as a budding photographer. Oh, really? Cool. Do you have a
[1477.56s -> 1489.51s]  vlog or something? A vlog? John, everyone uses Instapix now. I'm Theo Understars. Look me up.
[1493.03s -> 1497.70s]  Instapix. This terrain's pretty tricky. Are you turning back soon?
[1498.66s -> 1502.34s]  Nope, I'm heading for the summit. I can really see the determination in your eyes.
[1502.90s -> 1508.34s]  It's inspiring. You say so. I bet you can make it to the summit too.
[1508.98s -> 1518.58s]  Maybe. I don't really care about reaching the top TBH. Oh, but I heard there are some legit old
[1518.58s -> 1525.46s]  ruins up beyond the city. Like 1800s legit. I know it's risky, but I have to see them for myself.
[1526.74s -> 1532.89s]  I'm gonna do this one more time. What's that thing you say right before you do something
[1532.89s -> 1547.62s]  irresponsible? You're okay. Let's whatever. I don't know. It's YOLO. I know it's YOLO.
[1548.66s -> 1552.58s]  Throw caution to the wind. Ah, no, that's not it. I'm thinking of.
[1575.62s -> 1593.54s]  This game loses a foe letter grade. Wait, but I gotta collect the gems.
[1594.26s -> 1611.26s]  I gotta figure out how this works. Wait, hold on. Oh, that's all that does? Well, what's the other
[1611.34s -> 1624.76s]  side do? All right, so now let's go get it. Let's go to the right. This is open. There's a lot of
[1624.76s -> 1639.37s]  ways to go. I missed a secret. Oh, I'm gonna miss them all. Don't worry. I did it. I did it,
[1639.37s -> 1656.17s]  but I didn't do it. Secret. I don't see a secret over here. How is he supposed to know that it is
[1656.17s -> 1669.05s]  a secret? I don't know. How would I know that? I can see this. I could go that way. No, we're
[1669.05s -> 1674.49s]  looking for just game completion. I can load this up later and YOLO into the secret. It's all I want.
[1675.29s -> 1689.13s]  It's not just a watch. It's a symbol. Stop saying that.
[1699.59s -> 1725.56s]  Are you beach ready? Oh, no. Super Meat Boy. Stop making me do things. No idea where I am.
[1725.56s -> 1749.00s]  I hope I'm going the right way. Secret over there, right? I found it. See? Ah, I think I got them.
[1749.96s -> 1785.34s]  No, I need that. Oh, shit. I didn't need to do the dash. Maybe I did. Yes, I did. I've got seven.
[1785.98s -> 1801.90s]  I'm not gonna do it. Okay, so I get to go. I guess I gotta do it faster. I gotta do it faster.
[1802.62s -> 1810.66s]  Meat Boy, stop fucking up my video game. Oh, Super Meat Boy. You made my muscle memory into Meat Boy.
[1810.66s -> 1833.32s]  Fuck. I gotta go faster. I gotta let go. Switch to commander video. I'm trying to do a double jump.
[1833.32s -> 1852.38s]  Oh, boy. I had it too. I got it. That counts, right? No, it doesn't. They give you these Pac-Man
[1852.38s -> 1865.99s]  fruits and I'm expected to get them all. You can't be expected to get them all. Maybe one. So what
[1865.99s -> 1869.91s]  does this do? Okay, here we go. I figured it out already. What first try? Guaranteed. No, no,
[1869.91s -> 1895.21s]  I'm just kidding. What have been? Oops. Damn it. All right, got it. So I'm gonna say at nine
[1896.41s -> 1912.57s]  bandages that I'm not gonna get anymore because I don't need them. Oh, I can't. Oh, shit. Did I get
[1912.57s -> 1929.35s]  it? Does it count? It counts. Fuck. Oops. I just was out of here. No, hold on. Okay, so we can go
[1929.35s -> 1945.27s]  up. There's a paid in-game currency right here. I was wrong. Did it wrong. Did it wrong again.
[1945.91s -> 1956.73s]  Okay, I'm gonna say up, over, left. Meat Boy. Don't, Meat Boy. Side, lift up, boing, boing.
[1956.73s -> 1967.51s]  Clown car joke incoming. I'm sorry to severely disappoint you, but I do not have a clown car
[1968.82s -> 1992.12s]  ready to go. Not right now. Yet. All right, where are we at? Can I go down? I might want to fix that then.
[1993.08s -> 2007.43s]  What, the clown? Clown car? It's probably in the closet already. Oh, shit. I get it. No, I don't. I
[2007.43s -> 2013.59s]  could just go around this way. Wait for a charge up and then I want to see down. Oh, come on. I landed
[2013.59s -> 2019.61s]  on the fucking shark teeth already. I was gonna say just do this. Oh, fuck. That was it. I had to
[2019.61s -> 2037.14s]  just wait for the charge. Derma, don't touch the spikes. Are you sure? Give me a, come on. It's
[2037.14s -> 2048.17s]  not gonna work, is it? Oh, fuck. Uh-oh. Yeah, I can't. It's wrong. It's wrong. You have to land for
[2048.17s -> 2066.33s]  the recharge to even happen. All right, so then I gotta go dash and what do I have to grab here then?
[2069.26s -> 2089.80s]  Oh, hmm. Oops. Can I knock this down? Ah, I can knock this down. Ah, I can knock that down.
[2090.52s -> 2108.25s]  But there's spikes on it. Grab the side? Apparently. What? I have to, all right, I gotta grab the side
[2108.25s -> 2125.99s]  of that and fall down with it and then jump off of it. You know I'm a fucking meat boy. I gotta get back over
[2125.99s -> 2150.23s]  there first. Holy shit, I'm just spamming. What are you spamming? Ow, my head. Just hold on. Hold on,
[2150.23s -> 2168.22s]  it'll do it again. First boss. I have to jump on his head three times. This memorial is dedicated
[2168.22s -> 2181.05s]  to those who perished on the climb. Okay, so I've made it. Here's the top of the mountain. I plant a
[2181.05s -> 2198.98s]  seed in there when a tree grows. I'm exhausted. But see, it's an orange tree. I'm not going to
[2198.98s -> 2211.77s]  use the automaton. This might have been a mistake. Ow, damn it. God, I thought that just said game
[2211.77s -> 2217.59s]  over. I was looking over here to my left and I turn and I'm just like game over. Oh, okay.
[2218.39s -> 2237.40s]  Ten. Ten out of twenty. What? There's so many more places. I have to go. Only ten berries. Yeah,
[2237.40s -> 2248.12s]  because there's a million places to go. There's so many places to go. This is chapter two old site.
[2251.94s -> 2258.60s]  Nice automaton, dude. Thanks. I really appreciate that. All right, give me a song. I'll do it right
[2258.60s -> 2306.02s]  off the bat. I will first try it. First song I see in the chat. All-star. And all that glitters is
[2306.02s -> 2331.11s]  gold. Oh, I have to press A. It's so annoying. Shut up. How dare you. I'm kidding. Don't shut up.
[2331.11s -> 2334.47s]  Some things are all weird now. Is there a secret message here?
[2337.24s -> 2352.04s]  This mirror dedicated to those... it's just backwards. That's not how you do it.
[2352.84s -> 2375.48s]  This is a really pretty land. I can get up there. Look, it's probably a berry up there. Move on,
[2375.48s -> 2390.62s]  John. I like this place. I knew it. I knew it. I knew that eventually they condition your brain
[2390.62s -> 2405.59s]  into thinking that falling down is bad. Falling down is good sometimes. I'm gonna get this. That's
[2405.59s -> 2419.10s]  the one I can see, so I'm gonna get this one. I thought I was supposed to be climbing a mountain.
[2420.14s -> 2436.26s]  What the fuck did I just do? What? I obviously have to go like this. Oh, all right. I figured
[2436.26s -> 2447.96s]  it out. I got it. There's even more of this. I went completely opposite direction of where I
[2447.96s -> 2460.52s]  may have supposed to be going. Oh, fuck. Okay. There's a secret down there. How do I get back
[2460.52s -> 2471.74s]  down there? How do I get... look. I think there's a secret right there. No. How do I restart? The
[2471.74s -> 2502.86s]  reset button. I need to go down here, land on this, and then... secret berry. Nice. That was cool.
[2504.39s -> 2515.69s]  Ooh. This is... a door. All right. Can I open the door? There's no way to open that door. How do I
[2515.69s -> 2533.66s]  get out of here? Like that. Is it a mirror? Whoa. Can I talk to the mirror?
[2539.58s -> 2545.19s]  All right. Well, I'm not going to react to that, apparently.
[2552.74s -> 2558.18s]  Whoa. Hold on. But I wasn't even ready. I needed to see what this was. I needed to...
[2559.62s -> 2568.10s]  I'm so overwhelmed. That was... okay. What is going on? I can hold on to this thing and look down.
[2569.06s -> 2573.75s]  Let's see. The game... I already knew there was a secret down here, and the game gave me binoculars
[2573.75s -> 2590.41s]  to see. But the thing is, though, guys, what the heck is in that cube? Epic just dropped it one day,
[2590.41s -> 2602.58s]  and we're all trying to figure it out. Does it give items? Does it hurt you? Can I go up through
[2602.58s -> 2618.65s]  this? Ah. You go up. So you go all the way through. That's really cool. So no matter what trajectory
[2618.65s -> 2624.33s]  you go, you can always pass all the way through it. It's good to know. It's right there. I have to
[2624.33s -> 2638.14s]  do it again. Cool. Is this fall? Secret? Hey, thanks, Fortnite Street. There's so many directions to go.
[2641.75s -> 2649.30s]  Oh, it turned... it turned him into jelly. I get it. It Christmas caked everything that was
[2649.30s -> 2659.35s]  impassable before. Cool. Where am I going? There's a secret... extra secret tape over there. I don't
[2659.35s -> 2673.59s]  know what that does. Fuck. I just pancaked myself, okay? So wait, I gotta go through now, then.
[2674.47s -> 2688.14s]  So we gotta go like this now. I can't see. I can't see. Oh, shit. Oh, don't...
[2690.22s -> 2696.73s]  What... what... what the heck is even inside that cube? I don't know. Maybe I should make
[2696.73s -> 2730.84s]  10 videos about it. B-side unlocked. Music track? All right, I'm gonna give... let's give the... I'm
[2730.84s -> 2735.32s]  gonna give this game a couple of extra points for one reason. You ready for the extra point reason?
[2737.94s -> 2742.10s]  Like, right now, you are... we're playing American football, and I'm going for the extra point, and
[2742.10s -> 2747.46s]  like, the knowledge I'm about to give you right now is the ball, and you're leaning down right
[2747.46s -> 2752.18s]  in front of it, like as on the opposing team. And I'm gonna... I'm gonna kick this ball, like you're
[2752.18s -> 2756.34s]  like a foot away from the ball, and I'm kicking it right into your face. That's the knowledge.
[2757.14s -> 2775.86s]  There's a lot of ways to go. How do I get that one? John... John... I get to go around and then drop
[2775.86s -> 2802.18s]  down to get that one, don't I? Damn it. Go up and then down. But where? But where? Wait, this one right
[2802.18s -> 2826.66s]  here. Wait a minute. How do I do this? And they said it couldn't be done. But I want to get that
[2826.66s -> 2841.93s]  other one too. How far? Oh, this is too much. Did everything do this? Uh, no. I feel like that's the
[2841.93s -> 2864.22s]  progression route. Hold on. What is this way? Nothing. Is there anything? Can I go out? I'm just
[2864.22s -> 2887.93s]  curious. I just need to know. Up there. Wait a second here. Hold on. One gosh darn second. Can I
[2887.93s -> 2913.85s]  get through? Can I get up there like this? Wow. Oh, I can. You gotta go up. Okay, I get it. And then
[2913.85s -> 2922.09s]  you have to go down. Straight up. Straight up again. No, and then down this way. And then across.
[2928.84s -> 2937.64s]  John, darling, slow down. Who said that? This is, this is progression. Ah, fuck it is.
[2941.93s -> 2951.86s]  Boom. I'm simply a concerned observer. You can tell the reason because I have red eyes. Are you
[2951.86s -> 2965.11s]  me? I'm a part of you. Why would part of me look so creepy? It's just what I look like, okay?
[2966.97s -> 2975.58s]  Deal with it. Sorry, I didn't. Forget about it. I can't tell you what a relief it is to finally get
[2975.58s -> 2982.71s]  out of here. But look, I'm worried about it. We need a hobby, but this. I know it sounds crazy,
[2982.71s -> 2989.06s]  but I need to climb this mountain. You are many things, darling, but you're not a mountain climber.
[2989.70s -> 2997.08s]  Not in a fucking million years. Who says I can't be? I know it's not your strong suit,
[2997.08s -> 3002.04s]  but be reasonable for once, you fucking idiot. You have no idea what you're getting into.
[3002.76s -> 3007.80s]  You can't even handle it. This is exactly why I need to do this. Okay, I'm done doing this.
[3007.80s -> 3019.08s]  Are you the weak part of me or the lazy part? I'm the pragmatic body. And I'm trying to be
[3019.08s -> 3036.94s]  diplomatic here. Let's go home together. Well, not anymore. Do I have to run away? Can I attack?
[3037.74s -> 3043.32s]  Dashing doesn't do anything. I can't. Okay, I just tried to goomba. Goomba doesn't work. What about
[3043.32s -> 3063.98s]  skeleton? Oh shit, I'm running out of energy. Wait, I need that. Shit. I can get it. I got it
[3063.98s -> 3086.57s]  already. Good. How do I get it? How do you get this? Can I break the wall? Oh, fuck. How do I get
[3086.57s -> 3095.77s]  over there? I can't get that. That's some secret. I'll have to figure it out like on a third playthrough.
[3097.98s -> 3110.23s]  Go in the door? I can't go in a door? Door. That's not gonna work. Can't open that?
[3112.76s -> 3128.87s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. What the heck? I thought I had to touch it again.
[3134.36s -> 3141.22s]  I don't. Okay, hold on. I can do twice. I can do two dashings. I didn't know I could go for
[3141.22s -> 3144.74s]  the spikes. All right. All right. All right. I thought I was gonna die hitting the spikes there.
[3154.86s -> 3171.62s]  Dummy. I had it the first time. Oh my god. Do you know what I wish I could see
[3171.62s -> 3181.67s]  with this game? Definitely a speed run. Okay. I fucking shut up and play. I'm doing so bad.
[3189.37s -> 3208.20s]  No, fuck. I gotta get that one first. Oh, fuck. Oh my god. All right. Hold on. I need a sip of
[3208.20s -> 3222.68s]  coffee. You have to bait and then dash. You don't get it all in one go. I gotta dash this fucking
[3222.68s -> 3237.43s]  thing. I'm literally just outplaying myself. I really am. You idiot! What do I do? Holy shit,
[3237.43s -> 3242.79s]  I'm so stupid. What's happening? Slow down. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?
[3243.67s -> 3269.53s]  What's wrong with me? Why is it three? You gotta go real fast to get this one.
[3277.85s -> 3292.36s]  You know what I would love to see with this game? No, I have to get it. I have to.
[3295.19s -> 3326.84s]  Wait a minute. Hold on. Oh, so they're not chasing me. Now I am unbeatable.
[3327.72s -> 3332.38s]  You stay here for a second and then... I already got it. What the fuck am I doing? I already have
[3332.38s -> 3363.02s]  it. All right. Everyone just stand still. I just stared into the microphone. Yeah. Please, God.
[3363.99s -> 3399.74s]  What? Go, go! Come on. I don't know what to do. Fall? Holy shit. Oh, I had it. Oh, fuck. All right.
[3399.74s -> 3428.12s]  Get ready. Get up. I'm trying to do a double jump. Fall. Fall. Fall. Fall. Go. Oh, you stupid.
[3428.20s -> 3449.00s]  Idiot. You deserve to be punched. Oh, you don't. You missed it. You missed it. But it's okay. You
[3449.00s -> 3478.20s]  can miss it. Oh, my God. Again, I'm shaking. I'm not shaking. I'm fine. Up. Go around. There's four
[3478.20s -> 3484.28s]  of them. What? I thought there was only three. Three. What's inside that cube? I don't think
[3484.28s -> 3518.95s]  we're ever going to find out. We gotta wait for them all to go by. You idiot. Let's do it. Oh,
[3518.95s -> 3532.44s]  fuck me. All right. This time, wait till they all go underneath. Holy shit. What have I done? No,
[3532.44s -> 3559.35s]  no. You gotta just... How did I do that? What do I grab? Go back. Is there anything over here?
[3559.35s -> 3585.50s]  Wait. Should I go up? No other secrets or anything? No, no. No more ways to go. There is
[3585.50s -> 3602.01s]  another way to go. There's a secret over here. There's so many ways to go. Uh oh. Now I'm in
[3602.01s -> 3618.34s]  trouble. There's so much to do. I'm so dumb. You gotta go diagonal. Should have went through.
[3618.98s -> 3639.00s]  Like that. All right. Give me the berry. No other secrets? Not that I can see. So much to do. So
[3639.00s -> 3643.94s]  much to see. What's wrong with taking the back seat, you know? Sometimes you have to.
[3647.34s -> 3660.31s]  Nothing. What about over here? This looks breakable. All right. We have a coin center.
[3661.03s -> 3672.55s]  Answer the phone. Why am I doing this to you? What are you talking about? I'm just checking for
[3672.55s -> 3679.86s]  secrets. What? I'm not allowed to check for secrets? John, are you calling from a payphone?
[3681.30s -> 3689.77s]  Yep. No, wait. You called me. What are you talking about? It doesn't matter. I'm in trouble.
[3689.77s -> 3696.50s]  I'm being chased by someone. I don't really understand what's going on, but I know I'm in
[3696.50s -> 3703.45s]  danger. I can feel it. John, you only call me when you're panicking in the middle of the night.
[3704.33s -> 3706.89s]  You don't have to make up some ridiculous story just to get my attention.
[3710.01s -> 3717.85s]  Not making it up. You always do this. It's all right. Calm down. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Talk to me.
[3722.73s -> 3726.73s]  I'm climbing Celeste Mountain. I found this old mirror and it shattered, but part of me escaped.
[3728.38s -> 3737.70s]  And I'm dreaming, aren't I? John, of course you're dreaming. I haven't spoken to you in months.
[3738.58s -> 3743.50s]  Why would I start now? Why am I even climbing this stupid mountain?
[3750.71s -> 3753.99s]  I'm wondering the same thing. It's time to give up and go home.
[3756.98s -> 3775.67s]  First boss. Thanks for playing. Wait, I didn't even do it? Wait, I have to do this?
[3775.67s -> 3796.81s]  Now I do the real level? I have to do it again? Is it fall damage? No. Interesting though. Look,
[3797.13s -> 3805.75s]  can I go over here? I can. Okay. I don't even remember his name. If you paid me a thousand
[3805.75s -> 3809.11s]  dollars right now and told me to save this guy's name and you get a thousand dollars in cash,
[3809.11s -> 3826.89s]  I wouldn't be able to do it. Thane? Is it Thane? Hey John, you made it. Climbing up here was tough,
[3829.43s -> 3839.46s]  but totally worth it. Just look at those ruins. I took so many great picks. Want to see?
[3840.42s -> 3846.84s]  Thane. Is that why I'm thinking that? Because somebody said Thane last night? Last night? It's
[3846.84s -> 3856.26s]  been like four days. I don't- my brain sometimes has problems remembering things. Oh sure. Last
[3856.26s -> 3865.02s]  night. I was sick, okay? I'm sick right now. Theo. There it was. Thane. I have two letters.
[3865.02s -> 3871.70s]  And no, three letters actually. The T, the H, and the E. Maybe I'll finally hit a thousand
[3871.70s -> 3880.66s]  followers with these. But we need to formally commemorate this occasion. Take a selfie with me.
[3880.66s -> 3886.26s]  I don't take selfies. I hate them. I hate pictures. I don't like pictures. I don't like selfies.
[3890.20s -> 3899.24s]  Guys, a selfie is just a permanent looking in the mirror. You might- I don't want that. Every
[3899.24s -> 3906.89s]  selfie is just the way that you look at yourself in the mirror. You want like four hundred thousand
[3906.89s -> 3913.75s]  of those on your phone? I don't know if that's such a good idea.
[3917.27s -> 3933.54s]  Come on, it's easy. Like this. See? What's a regular picture of you then? A photo?
[3937.05s -> 3941.46s]  No, everybody does the same thing when they take a selfie. I'll show you.
[3942.62s -> 3949.38s]  So anyways, forget about how fucking bad this hair is today. And yes, I've got a Death Star
[3949.38s -> 3960.12s]  t-shirt on. The Death Star. People have made jokes before about how my whole wardrobe is Star Wars
[3960.12s -> 3967.22s]  related. I've just- over the years, I've just- I have probably 12 to 15 Star Wars shirts.
[3967.94s -> 3975.24s]  It's bad. They're just so easy. Look, Disney bought Star Wars. So at this point,
[3976.65s -> 3981.37s]  it's everywhere. You can't get away from Star Wars. So there's like a 10% chance that 10%
[3981.37s -> 3986.50s]  of your clothing has to be Star Wars related. Is it? Is 10% of your guys clothes Star Wars related?
[3988.87s -> 4002.39s]  Are you sure? Go into your t-shirts. Are we certain about this? Anyways, what's your
[4002.39s -> 4010.90s]  guys name? Thane? What was I just doing? Why did I turn the camera on? Oh, right, right, right.
[4010.90s -> 4018.15s]  Selfie. Okay. So when you take a photo, you are locking away a memory, right? Because you want to
[4018.15s -> 4021.11s]  take a photo and you want to make sure you preserve it and remember it. So, you know,
[4021.11s -> 4027.54s]  you're like, oh, it's me and some friends. Like, okay, like, cool. Okay, nice. You got it? Nice.
[4027.54s -> 4031.06s]  Hey, remember that time we went to, uh, Las Vegas? Yeah, here's a photo.
[4031.78s -> 4035.14s]  A selfie is just the way you look at yourself in the mirror. You go like this.
[4037.61s -> 4040.89s]  Ready? You tell me how this is any different than any selfie you've ever fucking seen in your life.
[4050.97s -> 4059.35s]  It's fucking stupid. Don't take him anymore. You need to smile. No, nobody does that. Look.
[4060.15s -> 4073.96s]  Yes, they do. No, they don't. Okay. If somebody links me one photo of a selfie of somebody smiling,
[4074.52s -> 4079.88s]  I will eat a thousand dollars. All right. Let's fucking go. Sorry about that. Don't worry. I
[4079.88s -> 4095.27s]  won't post that one. No, it's all right. You can post it. It was a joke. It was a fucking bit.
[4099.40s -> 4104.36s]  No, no, stop. That was, I'm kidding. No one links. No, I, I banned, I'm, links are banned.
[4109.80s -> 4114.36s]  Also, one other thing before we move on. I know people are probably like, oh, go back to fucking
[4114.36s -> 4122.39s]  Celeste. But listen, why is it? Every picture I ever take when I'm trying to smile, it's like pain.
[4122.39s -> 4127.27s]  I can't do it. I can't fucking smile in a photo because it takes too long. I'm right now like,
[4127.27s -> 4131.03s]  I'm like, we're like having some fun. We're like smiling and laughing and stuff. This is like fun.
[4131.03s -> 4136.47s]  We're having a good time, right? Well, I'm smiling. If I take a photo of me smiling, it always looks
[4136.47s -> 4145.70s]  like this every single fucking time, no matter what I do. I don't fucking understand. Why does
[4145.70s -> 4154.23s]  this happen? And even when I think it looks good in my mind, I'm like, oh, all right. Like,
[4154.23s -> 4160.87s]  hey, this is fun. We're having a good time. And I look at the photo and I zoom. Everybody does this.
[4160.87s -> 4165.43s]  You zoom in. Hey, can I see that for a second? Let me see. Like you took a photo. You took like
[4165.43s -> 4171.53s]  a group photo. Let me see. Let me see how it looks. Let me see my fucking face. God damn it.
[4176.38s -> 4185.30s]  Don't be so hard on yourself. Okay. Fine. I won't. No one looks good without a filter.
[4185.94s -> 4197.13s]  It's true. Show the automaton. Me on the right. Yeah.
[4200.49s -> 4205.64s]  Casual yet refined. Any more things this guy needs to tell me? What made you want to try
[4205.64s -> 4211.32s]  photography? My grandpa was really into it. Apparently. Do it again. I wasn't looking.
[4211.32s -> 4216.04s]  You lost your opportunity. Rewind 15 seconds. Apparently he was semi-famous in the photography
[4216.04s -> 4222.82s]  world. I don't know if I'll ever be that good. But it's nice to feel close to him. So you're
[4222.82s -> 4230.01s]  determined to climb the entire mountain. Yeah, I told myself I would. I'm done breaking promises
[4230.01s -> 4236.65s]  to myself. And the stream. I've told you Dreamcast is coming for like six months.
[4236.65s -> 4239.61s]  And I keep telling you, oh, we're going to do that like next weekend. I keep breaking it.
[4239.61s -> 4245.29s]  I gotta stop doing that. Life goals. I dig it. I doubt I'll make it to the top like you,
[4245.29s -> 4250.86s]  but I'm not ready to turn back just yet. Are you getting any data up here?
[4251.82s -> 4253.26s]  I don't have a smartphone.
[4255.03s -> 4265.56s]  John, I don't even know how to respond to that. All right. Bye. How do I like jump and like karate
[4265.56s -> 4275.80s]  kick the support of this 10 and heavenly? Nevermind. That's mean. Well, let's go. I'm
[4275.80s -> 4283.46s]  going to go to the left. I'm going to go underneath. I'm going to go up through and drill under.
[4285.88s -> 4288.92s]  All right. That didn't do anything. It was just there for fun. So let's just go.
[4289.64s -> 4309.56s]  This is not a secret unless no, you know, sometimes I have complaints about controls.
[4310.94s -> 4316.09s]  Like, I don't know if I got to tell you when I press B and I don't move it, I pressed it very
[4316.09s -> 4328.65s]  tight. I've not had one real complaint about the controls of the game, but I am going to
[4328.65s -> 4331.93s]  continue to accidentally meet boy. It's going to happen for the rest of the entire stream.
[4332.49s -> 4351.93s]  Secret. Oh yeah. Where's the joystick? Got you. Not allowed to dash, but you sure can. If you
[4351.93s -> 4363.14s]  grab it, are we ever going to find out what's in the cube? Oh, are you, you want to know what's
[4363.14s -> 4376.15s]  in the cube? Oh, okay. All right. So what I'm thinking is I think Epic is now, do I actually
[4376.15s -> 4397.42s]  make a phone call? It says mom. Hi mom. John, what a nice surprise. How does your trip? It's okay.
[4397.42s -> 4402.70s]  I'm just kind of overwhelmed. Oh no. Are you having another panic attack? Focus on your breathing,
[4402.70s -> 4420.23s]  honey. I'm here. What's going on? I picked up the phone. But what if inside the cube is another
[4420.23s -> 4431.08s]  cube? Well, then Peter Molyneux is going to have a lot of explaining to do. Six out of 18. I did.
[4432.36s -> 4444.89s]  Oh wait, hold on. I want to go look at that. What is this? B side. Old site, black moonrise mix, music.
[4449.83s -> 4454.47s]  So it's you. So it's just a different, oh boy, hold on. This is different.
[4457.54s -> 4473.05s]  Ow. This is just a secondary fun mode. Figured it out in 10 seconds. That's all I needed.
[4479.16s -> 4486.18s]  That's all I needed. I'll get it. I'll get it. I just might control it.
[4486.18s -> 4506.07s]  Control. Something about the control. Jump. Yeah. What do you mean jump? Why is it going to jump?
[4506.07s -> 4510.87s]  Jump. That's what I'm doing, isn't it? Just jump.
[4511.83s -> 4539.94s]  Hmm. Oh, shit. Well, okay. Come on. Do it. Oh, shit. I gotta go faster than that.
[4546.44s -> 4570.98s]  Ooh. All right. All right. All right. Okay. I had it. Had it. I'm gonna go straight up to this one.
[4583.26s -> 4601.83s]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Oh, that's it. No, no. You blew it again. I can't. I got it. I just regular jump.
[4602.79s -> 4624.66s]  Fuck. I'm gonna do it straight up. There's the question though is how in the heck you gotta
[4624.66s -> 4631.80s]  just grab a B. I get it. You gotta grab and don't dash. You need to jump around. How the fuck am I
[4631.80s -> 4645.45s]  gonna do that? Because you gotta go like this. I'm so annoyed at that. Not the game myself.
[4650.14s -> 4656.06s]  I mean, I'm pressing A. Pretty clear. Shut up and play. Okay. Who am I talking to?
[4659.74s -> 4675.50s]  All right. I'm losing it here. I'm hitting the ceiling. I'm not doing it fast enough in there.
[4677.18s -> 4687.11s]  I'm so dumb. I can get it. It's fine. Come on. Recharge. Recharge. Whoa. Whoa. Wait. Okay. Hold
[4687.11s -> 4697.19s]  on. Oh, fuck. What do we got? Oh, no. Not one of these. Not one of these. I don't want to do this.
[4698.23s -> 4706.28s]  So, we gotta go through up. Oh, man. I gotta block this out. Maybe jump up here first
[4707.08s -> 4719.43s]  and then hold on. Oh, maybe. Cookie CRM with 10 community subs. Thank you, Cookie.
[4720.15s -> 4736.95s]  How do I get up there? The real question actually. Oh, come on. Really?
[4737.59s -> 4750.50s]  You do have to get that one first. It's the yeah. Do I have the extension turned on or is this part
[4750.50s -> 4764.33s]  of the game? Shit. I gotta go at an angle down that way. I actually should probably get this one
[4764.33s -> 4777.86s]  first and then go to the middle. No, go from left to right. This one straight up and then into the
[4777.86s -> 4787.75s]  corner. Into the corner. Get out. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Now what? Oh, fuck. Straight up.
[4788.55s -> 4804.54s]  Looks like it. Whoa. Yep. Oh, this is gonna be tough. You gotta hit that while you're going in.
[4805.18s -> 4816.76s]  I don't know where to go from there, though. What? Hold on. How does this end?
[4817.56s -> 4828.55s]  And then back up. I am so confused. Hold on. Through the whole thing? Okay. All right. All right.
[4835.51s -> 4839.83s]  Oh, it did. I angled it wrong. I didn't mean to angle it. Sometimes it just angles.
[4840.63s -> 4871.34s]  That's it. There's a lot to this. All right. At least the clone is gone.
[4872.06s -> 4892.06s]  Left. Left jump up. You idiot. I had it. Again, I didn't mean to do that.
[4895.82s -> 4899.98s]  I didn't mean to do that either. Fucking Meat Boy. I should have never played Meat Boy.
[4900.86s -> 4936.62s]  More. Up. Up and then up and down to the bottom right and then walk. I don't know. We're gonna
[4936.62s -> 4961.37s]  have to just do it. Go down maybe. Oh, fuck me. Whoa. Okay. Hold on. So I gotta get that one last.
[4962.79s -> 4979.70s]  All right. Go up. What are you doing? I really think you have to get this one last. For some
[4979.70s -> 4989.62s]  reason, I'm a moron and I'm getting it. Shit. I'm doing this in the wrong order.
[4990.58s -> 5013.19s]  Like that. That much is absolutely certain. I fucked it up again. Why? You have to go. I have
[5013.19s -> 5020.20s]  to go from the top left to the bottom right. So get the top left one last. I mean, I guess it
[5020.20s -> 5063.34s]  doesn't really matter, does it? Shit. That's not the right one. I gotta get up there. Trying to
[5063.34s -> 5071.85s]  bait them. No. Sometimes the controller really does make me go the direction I don't want to go.
[5072.81s -> 5086.65s]  What are you doing? Shit. That was it. I had it. I just didn't do it fucking far enough.
[5113.51s -> 5124.15s]  Oh my god. Give me a break. Why? I had it again. At least I have a pattern down that I can reliably
[5124.15s -> 5170.12s]  do. Got it. So somebody just said, if this is end game content, what am I doing this for?
[5176.06s -> 5191.18s]  I just have to hold it. Because you're a troll. Is this like bonus end game kind of shit?
[5199.88s -> 5212.52s]  Fuck. So what you're saying is I'm going to get like this stuff out of the way. Come on,
[5212.52s -> 5219.35s]  you can do it. And effectively I'm doing some of the harder mission. Okay, that's cool.
[5220.47s -> 5238.58s]  It's really fun. Down and now what? If I go, I guess I did it like that. But
[5239.38s -> 5245.16s]  what's the up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. I had it. What am I doing?
[5246.28s -> 5266.71s]  I forgot about the spikes. Stupid. I don't know why I'm trying to go left there.
[5275.98s -> 5297.66s]  No, there's more. How much more is there? I just like, what's going on here? Down,
[5297.66s -> 5335.77s]  diagonal, diagonal. Hold on. I got caught there. Hold on. I'm literally pressing up.
[5337.83s -> 5343.19s]  All right. Okay. So I can dash right at the last second before I hit these spikes.
[5354.46s -> 5373.22s]  Holy shit. Okay. I got to grab the wall. Shit. Oh man. All right. So it's hold the wall,
[5373.22s -> 5400.97s]  go, dash, upright, bottom right, up, left, and then grab the wall. Damn. Shit. I don't have any more.
[5401.93s -> 5421.91s]  Oh no. So I, I got to jump out of this one, right? Really? What's that? You saw me dash? I
[5421.91s -> 5450.02s]  dashed off into it. Meat boy, quit fucking me. That came out. Meat boy. No. I wonder.
[5450.02s -> 5461.27s]  Can you straight up? Yep. Straight up. And then what? That's the real question.
[5463.66s -> 5472.18s]  Holy shit. I didn't even get to see that part. So hold on. Up, up, up,
[5474.02s -> 5487.03s]  top left, top right. Just play the main game. Yeah. I kind of just accidentally clicked on this,
[5487.03s -> 5497.13s]  didn't I? He's going to finish this and he's going to breeze through the campaign.
[5502.41s -> 5507.46s]  I am. Maybe I shouldn't be like muscle memory learning how to do all this.
[5508.10s -> 5525.08s]  There are no checkpoints on B-side. Really? Jesus. Wait a minute. My goodness. Um,
[5525.96s -> 5530.86s]  at least I can see that now. I already passed the checkpoint. I did.
[5541.19s -> 5552.04s]  Now I'm trying to rush it. I'm trying to rush it. I'm not even trying to rush it. If you
[5552.04s -> 5559.61s]  quit a chapter, you lose all. How close am I to finishing this? How many more are after this?
[5561.03s -> 5569.70s]  How is that not working? I probably should start using the D-pad. That's going to happen
[5569.70s -> 5573.54s]  over and over again. Now I'm using the D-pad and it's still working. It's still happening.
[5574.18s -> 5603.78s]  Okay. Both very close. No, I would agree with you, but I am using an Xbox one controller,
[5604.42s -> 5608.82s]  which as you know, the D-pad is one giant button. It's the worst D-pad of any controller.
[5611.42s -> 5616.30s]  If you press up on an Xbox one control, you're pressing like all of the top of the whole
[5616.30s -> 5628.42s]  control. You might as well be pressing every face button, dude. All right. Come on. I can do this.
[5637.75s -> 5646.30s]  Arrow keys. Yeah, but you can. So irritating. Uh, arrow keys. Sure. But then you actually,
[5646.30s -> 5649.98s]  you have to play with the keyboard, which is, uh, I can't. It's un-variable for me.
[5654.26s -> 5663.93s]  Dammit. What the hell do I do when I get there? Do I have to go grab on to the, okay,
[5664.73s -> 5674.42s]  through top left, grab the ledge and then drew top right. Let's try it. I can get there.
[5681.48s -> 5687.00s]  Oh, I got to go through there. Oh, I had it. Oh, that sucks. No.
[5693.21s -> 5695.85s]  Shit. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it.
[5696.49s -> 5704.14s]  I'm not going to fall through that damn thing. What the hell am I going to do about that?
[5704.78s -> 5721.61s]  I tried to jump out of it. Just didn't do it. Why is it not jumping out?
[5722.33s -> 5731.27s]  Is there a reason why that's not happening? I keep trying to jump out of there.
[5747.27s -> 5751.64s]  Holy shit. All right. Come on. That's it, right? This is it. This has to be it.
[5752.04s -> 5760.12s]  I'm on level one. I'm on level two of the actual campaign. All right. What do I need to do?
[5761.42s -> 5774.92s]  Why did I open this? I guess we're going to go straight up.
[5775.96s -> 5793.62s]  Get that one. The left. I got to just do it. I can't just peek. Holy shit. What the hell
[5793.62s -> 5816.90s]  did I just do to myself? I didn't jump. Um, well, hold on. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[5816.90s -> 5821.54s]  So then we're going to jump over, fall through. Hold on. Hold on now.
[5822.58s -> 5828.90s]  Through. Hold it. Hold on now. What do I do now? What happened? No, I had to, what does it,
[5828.90s -> 5835.77s]  where does it go? What the fuck was that? It makes a wall. So I gotta, I gotta go from there
[5835.77s -> 5853.67s]  and diagonal up to the right. Shit. All right. I had it. Got it. Now let's just make sure I get
[5853.67s -> 5873.13s]  this correct. Let's do it. Let's finish this damn thing. That's high. Um, uh, so I'm going to get
[5873.13s -> 5880.15s]  a start on the right screen. Left. I think we just have to go back and forward. Grab that one. You
[5880.15s -> 5900.09s]  get a dash again. I got to get that jump down. I wonder, can you just queue it up inside? No,
[5900.09s -> 5912.97s]  it has to be right on the left, doesn't it? Damn. I guess I'm going to do it that way.
[5913.93s -> 5921.99s]  Maybe not. Can I just go, I can just go up. I mean, maybe that's going to be tough.
[5931.34s -> 5941.51s]  No, no way. I mean, maybe, maybe. Hold on. If I just jump up the normal way. Okay. No, I can do
[5941.51s -> 5949.78s]  that. I have to jump out of that, which is the biggest pain in the ass for me is trying to get
[5949.78s -> 5970.49s]  the jump. Okay. Where does that go? Oh, come on. What, where does it go? Give me the stupid
[5970.49s -> 5981.80s]  fucking skull thing. What does it drop? It drops down there. What's the point of this?
[5981.80s -> 5986.82s]  I don't know. What's the point of this? Why don't I just leave? Can I just leave?
[5990.47s -> 6015.24s]  What does that do for me? Can jump. So unreliable for me. And so that makes spikes all the way down.
[6016.28s -> 6036.70s]  Come on. I don't get what, what's the point of putting it down? Jesus.
[6036.70s -> 6050.41s]  I guess maybe I'll just grab onto it. Why is the jump so unreliable?
[6053.50s -> 6076.15s]  I'm doing it at the same time, every time. Oh my God. What am I doing? What the fuck?
[6076.15s -> 6103.82s]  I'm so confused. So straight through and then up, up. Yeah. And then I got to go back down
[6103.82s -> 6134.06s]  and around the whole damn thing. I guess maybe not curious of how the hell this plays out.
[6136.26s -> 6147.85s]  I can only look at it again because it seems like that's not the right thing to do. So I grab onto
[6147.85s -> 6158.22s]  the, it comes down and I grab onto it. I have to go to the top left or maybe I could just go back.
[6158.22s -> 6160.46s]  Why would I go back to the, yeah. So I got to go top left.
[6166.12s -> 6174.33s]  Okay. All right. All right. Straight right. I feel you. Now I'm just rushing because my brain
[6174.89s -> 6204.17s]  is scrambled eggs. All right. Here we go. Oh, fuck. Um, um, oh, I dodged. No, fuck. Oh, hi.
[6205.85s -> 6218.65s]  That was it. I got it. I'm sorry. I had, I didn't, I thought I hit the wall. That's why I freaked out
[6218.65s -> 6233.59s]  because I didn't, I didn't have control. I like, I took my, I'm brushing again. I got it. It's over.
[6233.59s -> 6239.99s]  I beat it. I mean, it's a fucking pain in the ass, but I did. All right. Would you slow down?
[6239.99s -> 6276.57s]  You did it. You know what to do. Just finish it. Bingo. Anything else? I guess we just gotta
[6276.57s -> 6323.48s]  go straight up. Just get, just pick it up. Black moon ride. What does that mean? What do I get
[6323.48s -> 6348.81s]  for doing that? Side complete. So what does that do? Times. I get 199. I hate that. I wish I died
[6348.81s -> 6365.05s]  one more time. Go back and die again. Okay. Well that was cool. I like that because that was,
[6365.05s -> 6370.65s]  okay. So that was challenging, but it wasn't impossible. It was just challenging and fun.
[6376.92s -> 6383.18s]  He's so early in the game. I know. I, I don't know why I did it. It was fun.
[6383.18s -> 6396.23s]  Celestial resort. Chapter three. It wasn't dog shit impossible. Yeah. Sometimes games like this
[6396.23s -> 6405.51s]  just make it dog shit impossible for you. Be proud of your death count. The more you die,
[6405.51s -> 6416.87s]  the more you're learning. Keep going. Yeah, that's true. Hey, welcome back to the regular game.
[6417.67s -> 6428.54s]  It all feels so easy now. Look, I just have to walk. That's great. Look at how easy it is to avoid
[6430.42s -> 6442.68s]  mold. Wait, can I get on the roof? You're going to die more times here than the last level.
[6442.68s -> 6461.72s]  Just saying. Really? Got a berry. Don't I die. It's okay. Let's just start here. I'm going to,
[6461.72s -> 6468.22s]  yeah, I'm probably going to go up here. Why not? I guess I do have to get up there somehow.
[6469.18s -> 6501.24s]  Hmm. Oh, fuck. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, look at that. I cheated.
[6501.88s -> 6510.44s]  I'm still cheating by the way. The dash just resets upon exiting. And yeah, that's cool.
[6511.24s -> 6531.62s]  Picking up berries. Any more? 17. Ooh, a key. Oh, that's not that exciting. It opens this door.
[6532.82s -> 6553.74s]  I was going to say, cool secret. What else is up here? Berry. Well, I probably have to go
[6553.74s -> 6560.65s]  inside and then left for this one. I got the secret fucking key. That's right. And I said the F word.
[6560.65s -> 6569.14s]  I'm sorry. This is kind of like the last level in DuckTales. The last boss room when you fight
[6569.14s -> 6577.72s]  Dracula. Oddly specific, I know. I'm sorry. That's just the way it is. Please ring for service.
[6589.64s -> 6595.32s]  I'm wasting the battery on my automaton. Welcome. May I help you? Are you a ghost?
[6596.60s -> 6600.84s]  Ghost? Don't be silly. I am the concierge of this fine establishment.
[6602.60s -> 6612.26s]  Welcome to the world-renowned Celestial Resort Hotel. Mr. Oshiro at your service.
[6615.22s -> 6620.15s]  Two guests in one day. This is finally picking up. How long will you be staying with us?
[6621.30s -> 6625.22s]  Oh, I'm just passing through. I'm climbing the mountain. Do you have a back exit?
[6626.98s -> 6636.52s]  A back exit. Just passing through. This will not do. You know, I can still hear you. Right.
[6638.44s -> 6644.22s]  In any case, our rear service door is reserved for hotel staff only. However, our top floor
[6644.22s -> 6649.58s]  presidential suite features a wide class view of the peak. Yes, you'll be quite comfortable up there.
[6650.46s -> 6660.46s]  Why am I hearing phone signal sounds? I don't know. I'm not hearing those.
[6663.14s -> 6665.70s]  Maybe I could get on the roof from there and climb down the back.
[6666.66s -> 6670.90s]  Presidential suite. Marvelous idea, Oshiro. What is your name for our records?
[6672.18s -> 6675.14s]  I'm John. But again, I'm really not interested in staying.
[6677.05s -> 6689.99s]  Right this way. Ms. John. I can ring it again. What's this? Very old dusty guest book. Many of
[6689.99s -> 6697.29s]  the pages are damaged or missing. The comments, however, are glowing. We'll never forget our time
[6697.29s -> 6711.10s]  here. I've never felt more at peace. Thank you. Okay. Does it come back? Nope. All right. Get it
[6711.10s -> 6730.28s]  easy for me. Yeah. Yep. This ball. I don't think it does. So Barry, I'm going to, I can jump down.
[6731.00s -> 6748.49s]  Bradbury dash left. Okay. That would hurt. I need like take a break.
[6749.77s -> 6753.53s]  That hurt. It really did. Some weight is involved in this one.
[6754.89s -> 6759.93s]  Okay. This was curious how it worked. I can put extra weight on it. They could go faster.
[6761.85s -> 6766.97s]  Didn't even need the other dash. Did I get too good at the game to not need that dash?
[6767.13s -> 6780.86s]  Is there such a thing? Secret. Oh, wait, what's down here? This is going to go all the way to the left,
[6780.86s -> 6789.56s]  right and out the door. Did I just skip everything? No. Don't, don't get a big head about this.
[6790.36s -> 6797.03s]  So that's just the way back. Okay. I didn't even know that was there.
[6798.71s -> 6822.07s]  Too lazy. More community subs. Why did I end up here? It's just a great Canadian thing.
[6823.48s -> 6827.88s]  A great Canadian fuck club. Thanks for the 10 community subs. There's been a shit load
[6827.88s -> 6839.72s]  tonight. There's been like 50 or 60 community subs tonight, hasn't there? Thanks a lot guys.
[6839.72s -> 6862.10s]  Seriously. Did I miss a secret? So much mold. Oh, okay. Well, let's check a, let's check a look
[6862.10s -> 6871.00s]  over here. Another tape. I ain't doing that one. I'll do that one. I'll do that one like next week.
[6871.96s -> 6882.66s]  How do I even attempt to do this? Do it now. I can't, I can't even go that way.
[6884.34s -> 6888.82s]  I'm going to pee my pants. All right. Just all right. Let me pee my pants and then we'll get
[6888.82s -> 6897.35s]  going. It's always after two hours. It's two hours on the mark every time. Right before I leave,
[6897.35s -> 6905.61s]  DEDO, DEDO, thanks for the 10 community subs. Thank you for your like 75 community subs in the
[6905.61s -> 6914.87s]  first hour and a half of the stream. Two hours. You guys are too generous. I'll be right back. I'm
[6914.87s -> 7094.04s]  just going to pee. Hi there. How you doing? Grab some water too, because you need to hydrate when
[7094.04s -> 7102.12s]  you're playing video games. How's the audio too? Am I too soft, too loud? I feel like I might need
[7102.12s -> 7120.18s]  to drop the audio a little bit in the game. Maybe like, maybe like by 2%. How's that? Better?
[7120.82s -> 7129.26s]  That's probably a little better. Yeah. I'm, I'm never loud enough for some crazy reason. I don't
[7129.26s -> 7153.48s]  know why. All right. We're good. Okay. There's a little spot to fall down there. Ah, it's going
[7153.48s -> 7157.96s]  to take me all, all the way to the left. It's going to be the thing that I need to get guaranteed.
[7158.84s -> 7173.37s]  Oh, I didn't see that meatball there. There it is. BRB, my McAfee antivirus needs to update.
[7174.17s -> 7188.62s]  Why do you have McAfee? Is it, is that, is that like an all the way to the left best buy computer?
[7189.34s -> 7204.33s]  Cause they all have McAfee on them. Oh, he's getting political. So that takes us to the key.
[7204.33s -> 7220.26s]  Then we got to go down. Oh, I stepped on it. Cool. Got the two berries in there.
[7223.53s -> 7234.28s]  I tried to rush it and that's what happened. The music is changing. Oh, what about,
[7234.28s -> 7239.77s]  can I hold these? Oh, no, I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I see. Did they ever go back down?
[7240.65s -> 7247.50s]  I don't think they do, but it's okay. I don't even need them.
[7248.38s -> 7270.36s]  Well, I might, I actually might need them. Oh, what am I doing? Same deal. Got to go across.
[7273.00s -> 7279.62s]  All right. Oh, I wait, I can go up there. I want to go up there. I think I want to go up there.
[7280.34s -> 7307.29s]  So I need the dash. So how am I going to do that to not dash? I just waited a little too long.
[7307.45s -> 7324.52s]  Oof. Ah, that was it too. Shit. Grab on the edge and just climb and jump. Got it. All right.
[7324.52s -> 7342.12s]  What's up here? Berry. I didn't even see the thing at the top. Didn't even look. Well, I have to have
[7342.12s -> 7358.10s]  a dash. So you have to fall in dash. Got it. No shit. You got to grab the edge. Jeremy, Jeremy.
[7359.06s -> 7373.56s]  Okay. Go. Any more dialogue for me? Please follow me closely, Miss John. The elevator is just down
[7373.56s -> 7382.07s]  the hall. The hotel's pretty rough shape. Is it really open for business? Of course we're open.
[7382.07s -> 7385.67s]  The Celestial Resort Hotel would never close during prime tourism season.
[7388.81s -> 7400.49s]  This water is a little, I think it might be time for a filter change on that water.
[7401.21s -> 7402.81s]  Uh, my bag? No, thanks. I'll keep it.
[7405.48s -> 7417.08s]  Very well. What a peculiar guest. Don't do that. I'm sorry. I forgot. That was a mouth noise.
[7418.20s -> 7439.96s]  What are you thinking? What are you thinking? I'm thinking this.
[7442.87s -> 7455.72s]  I didn't get that. Do I even need to jump? Probably, yeah. I gotta wait. Oh my god.
[7456.68s -> 7464.50s]  How can I not do this? Oh my god. What's wrong with me?
[7466.70s -> 7487.00s]  This is the moment you have to wait. I don't like waiting. Just wait. The diamond. There has to be
[7487.00s -> 7491.24s]  some reason why I did not see that. I don't know why. It was just right in front of me the whole
[7491.24s -> 7524.79s]  time. I don't know. I didn't even see it. Locked door. I don't even need the diamonds. Can you
[7524.79s -> 7534.57s]  get me my reader setting? I got an idea.
[7551.93s -> 7558.86s]  So I obviously have to push that all the way to the bottom and then dash back onto it.
[7559.50s -> 7566.14s]  If I were a gamer, that's what I would be doing right now, but I'm not doing it right now.
[7566.86s -> 7580.33s]  I'm just, shouldn't have played the B sites. Shouldn't have played the B sites. I'm not to
[7580.33s -> 7584.01s]  go slow. And I was so used to just like, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[7584.81s -> 7602.02s]  That might be enough. Stupid idiot. What's wrong with you? Got it. Get it. Collect it. Collect it.
[7602.02s -> 7618.70s]  Thank you. Well, guys, look at this gamer. I played one before. I played a game before. One.
[7620.81s -> 7624.49s]  Well, that was really stupid because that's exactly what I had to do. But I used my dash.
[7625.93s -> 7645.88s]  Did it again. Fuck. You gotta grab onto the side and jump. I'm so dumb.
[7651.93s -> 7676.58s]  Oh shit. Shit. Well, now I get it. You got to skip that one. What the hell am I doing?
[7676.58s -> 7686.09s]  Look top left. Look top left. What are you guys doing? What about it? You want to go up there?
[7698.78s -> 7704.22s]  Boomer vision. I don't have boomer vision. I just, so this is where you get the super secret one.
[7704.22s -> 7721.21s]  All right. Hold on. It's one of your powers. There is, all right. There actually is a lot,
[7722.01s -> 7741.27s]  there are a lot of ways to go. You gotta go diagonal. Maybe fall this way and then,
[7741.27s -> 7753.27s]  okay. Ooh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Just fall in and dash up. It's that easy. Collect it.
[7753.27s -> 7759.96s]  I don't want to do this again. Collect it. You're going to make me do this whole thing
[7760.68s -> 7770.92s]  to prove that I, I mean, ah, I'm not capable. My fucking dirty hair just got in the way.
[7770.92s -> 7799.83s]  Why don't I just go this way? Well, oh, okay. I'm fine. Fun game. So I did it.
[7800.47s -> 7827.93s]  Let's just go. Secret down here. Yes, there is. Okay. Wait, I gotta get that key.
[7828.65s -> 7838.98s]  Will you get up there? Why is this harder than me doing the thing? Not even hard. I mean,
[7838.98s -> 7851.58s]  it was a little hard. I mean, that's where the meat boy powers come in and all. Okay. For a second,
[7851.58s -> 7854.86s]  I thought I could stand on the piano and then my brain immediately corrected itself.
[7855.82s -> 7874.28s]  I don't know what the hell I'm doing. I can slow down. There's no reason to go that fast.
[7875.16s -> 7901.59s]  See, just slow down. There's no reason to go that crazy. Key. Got it. I could go left though.
[7902.95s -> 7916.10s]  No, this is the key to the door, right? Oops. It's all right. I can get it again. No, fall.
[7916.98s -> 7923.58s]  No. All right. I saw the meatball on the left. I thought I was going to do something for me.
[7924.30s -> 7940.09s]  I gotta go from the other side. Up top. Wait, but what about down there? That looks really,
[7940.09s -> 7948.25s]  it looks like I'm supposed to go through that. Doesn't it? There's a lot of secrets in this game.
[7950.63s -> 7954.63s]  Ms. Joan, I'm really the most employee to keep up. I'm running a world-class establishment here.
[7954.63s -> 7962.01s]  I don't have time to wait around for meandering guests. You really don't have to wait for me.
[7962.01s -> 7968.31s]  I'm just looking for a way through this place. Oshiro, you idiot. The customer's always right.
[7969.11s -> 7971.43s]  Business is finally picking up and you lose your temper.
[7973.86s -> 7979.70s]  Of course, Ms. Joan. My sincere apologies. I was out of line. Please feel free to explore
[7979.70s -> 7998.30s]  at your leisure. And I will. Right through. I don't like the Tetris room. This is just
[7998.30s -> 8015.06s]  failed Tetris. This is what it looks like when I play. I don't like it. I obviously need a key.
[8015.70s -> 8024.63s]  Where do I go? Ah, I gotta go down? Down? Down again? Down more?
[8025.59s -> 8040.55s]  Uh, can't break it. This must turn into something. This must, this is probably a dream level up here,
[8040.55s -> 8060.23s]  I would assume. Goddamn maze. Yeah, this is gonna open up. Hello, sir. This clutter is out of control.
[8061.67s -> 8070.22s]  When did this happen? I don't even know where to begin. Do you run this place by yourself?
[8071.18s -> 8077.70s]  You're right, Ms. Joan. I'll never sort this mess out alone. It's hopeless. It's not what I meant.
[8078.50s -> 8083.54s]  Just breathe. Mr. Ushiro, breathe. It's just a little spring cleaning. Well, more than a little,
[8083.54s -> 8093.18s]  but I can now. No. It's a lost cause. I gotta fix this. I gotta fix the Tetris room.
[8093.90s -> 8106.89s]  How long you been running the hotel? Quite some time now. Business has been slow. You must really
[8106.89s -> 8121.08s]  love your work. Oh yes. In the hotel business, our passion is perfecting the delicate art of hospitality.
[8121.08s -> 8125.88s]  A truly great hotel lives eternally in the cherished memories of its satisfied guests.
[8127.08s -> 8140.26s]  That's the spirit. Now let's get started on this mess. I'm going this way, so we're gonna go this
[8140.26s -> 8151.40s]  way. Oh, Thane! What's up, man? YOLO! Remember YOLO! Are you a guest here, too? John, I'm so happy to
[8151.40s -> 8158.81s]  see you right now. I'm all about spooky mysteries, but this is getting too real.
[8159.61s -> 8162.97s]  Have you talked to Mr. Ushiro? I think he could really use some help.
[8164.41s -> 8171.70s]  You think? He's a creepy old weirdo. I bet he's cleaning out a nook to hide our bodies as we speak.
[8173.06s -> 8176.02s]  I'm gonna crawl through this vent. It's blowing cold air in from outside.
[8178.89s -> 8183.69s]  Come on! I was gonna just scream of Captain Falcon, but then I thought I don't think I
[8183.69s -> 8188.49s]  can do a Captain Falcon, so I stopped myself halfway through, and that's how it turned out.
[8190.65s -> 8195.37s]  Mr. Ushiro's troubled, but I don't think he wants to hurt us. He just needs to clean up this mess.
[8196.17s -> 8205.48s]  I want to help him. John, that's very sweet, but this is dangerous. We need to get out of here and
[8205.48s -> 8210.78s]  call an expert on creepy old dudes. We aren't prepared for this. I think I can get through to
[8210.78s -> 8217.13s]  him. Well, I mean, you gotta deal with the caramel that's in the dryer right now. Somebody's fucking
[8218.09s -> 8222.09s]  doing something weird in there. That's not how you make candy. Actually, I guess you could.
[8222.97s -> 8230.81s]  I'll catch up with you later. Man, you're more stubborn than my sister. I thought that was
[8230.81s -> 8240.46s]  impossible. Take care of it. You can make candy in a dryer in a controlled environment, and don't
[8240.46s -> 8261.10s]  try this at home. Thanks, Thane. I'll see you outside. Wait, there's a spot right here? Yes,
[8261.10s -> 8271.90s]  there is, but what? I need to get rid of the purple candy. Oh, I get it. I figured out what's
[8271.90s -> 8276.30s]  going on here. That all the red, that's all soap. That's like all dirty soap and shit from the dryer
[8276.54s -> 8281.50s]  the washing machine that flaps. This is like laundry. I get it. It's like a laundry soap level.
[8281.50s -> 8309.82s]  Okay, I understand now. Remember that's there because I won't. Am I going the right way? I
[8309.82s -> 8318.09s]  think so. How do I get that? I can't jump. I can't dash. How am I supposed to go through that?
[8325.34s -> 8333.93s]  Oh shit. Okay, hold on. I fell off. I didn't even press the button. I just tripped,
[8340.95s -> 8351.82s]  but I gotta grab onto the edge. No, no, no. I gotta grab the other edge. That's how you do it,
[8351.82s -> 8366.12s]  but come on, man. Stop doing that. You're getting me in trouble. Why just jump over?
[8366.12s -> 8385.34s]  What am I doing? Meat Boy has ruined my brain. I'm going to assume there's probably a few buttons
[8385.34s -> 8390.46s]  that I have to press and eventually it's going to take away all the purple, all the green,
[8390.46s -> 8398.15s]  all the right. It's going to be like that. I know it is. If anybody says I'm wrong,
[8398.23s -> 8407.75s]  dip band. And I'm talking forever. Not like five minutes and no until Twitch TV turns its servers
[8407.75s -> 8427.70s]  off. There it is. Yep. Folded all the laundry, sorted the laundry. Everybody thought that I
[8427.70s -> 8432.66s]  saw a shitload of question marks and a bunch of like a boomer brain and shit like that,
[8432.66s -> 8437.78s]  but that actually was laundry. This is water. It got folded and put away. So
[8438.66s -> 8473.99s]  I thought, really? My goodness. Cuter. I mean, this is a secret, but is this a secret just showing
[8473.99s -> 8527.54s]  me that there's another secret? What are you doing? I don't know. Purple. All right. See,
[8527.54s -> 8529.78s]  look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[8529.78s -> 8547.91s]  Ooh, scattered and lost. Okay. Cool. What is it? Do I, is that a track of a music track?
[8548.87s -> 8554.65s]  Holy shit. There's another secret. No, that's just an easy way to get back. Okay.
[8558.97s -> 8564.57s]  No, wait, wait, wait. Oh boy. Okay. Well, I lost the opportunity to get the berry that was over there.
[8565.29s -> 8574.97s]  A secret level is unlocked after four hearts. So I have two of them, right?
[8575.77s -> 8588.44s]  Can you die in the water? You can always just replay levels. Yeah, that's true.
[8592.23s -> 8601.66s]  Ah, right, right, right. Here's the other secret it was showing me. Computer. All right. The Pico
[8601.66s -> 8618.31s]  8. Celeste. Oh no, it's a commander video machine from meat boy. It's, it's a meat boy
[8618.31s -> 8642.49s]  commander video machine. Hey, I got a strawberry. Does that count? Or is this a joke? Everything is
[8642.49s -> 8673.54s]  meat boy. Can I go to the bottom right? All right. Okay. I can't, I get a, I can't dash.
[8685.72s -> 8740.18s]  Come here. I can't climb in this one. I can't climb up. 5,000. What? Got it. Oh,
[8741.14s -> 8746.20s]  no, I'm not going to do it. Here's the question. I guess I go like this.
[8746.84s -> 8755.00s]  I had it. You did it, but you just didn't do it. I had it again, but you just didn't do it again.
[8755.72s -> 8763.13s]  Is there a reason why you're doing that? Is this, there's gotta be a reason why he's doing that,
[8763.13s -> 8785.72s]  right? So I don't know. Maybe if you look up why he keeps doing that balloons. Okay. That's balloons
[8785.72s -> 8815.56s]  are the dash thing. Jump on the frog or the clouds. Yep. What the hell? Just dash and get it. Dash
[8815.56s -> 8836.38s]  and get it. All right. Now how much is left in this little mini game here? This is probably it,
[8836.38s -> 8851.30s]  right? A thousand. I got to hold onto that. This is the rest of the game. I get it. I get it. I get
[8851.30s -> 8863.91s]  it. I get it. I get it. And up here, diagonal thing, though I did it. No, I don't, do I get
[8863.91s -> 8875.26s]  something for doing this? Is this like a thing that I'm going to get? I got to get the, you don't get
[8875.26s -> 8887.43s]  anything. You don't get anything. It's just a side thing. It's just fun. Oh, okay. It's just the
[8887.43s -> 8896.50s]  original game that they made in a game jam. Oh, all right. That's cool. That's why it's all in
[8896.50s -> 8910.94s]  one of these little computers. Old side. All right. I beat the game. This is it. I win. I beat it.
[8911.50s -> 8927.34s]  Yeah, I win. Not playable from the main menu. All right. That's cool. Interesting stuff. Finish
[8927.34s -> 8931.82s]  this or you get your gamer license revoked. No, that's not the real game. I mean, it's the
[8931.82s -> 8938.17s]  original. An old paper sticks out from a clutter. Attention, hotel staff. It is my sad duty to
[8938.17s -> 8942.65s]  inform you that the Celestial Resort Hotel will close indefinitely following this season due to
[8942.65s -> 8948.81s]  circumstances beyond our control. It was an honor to have served alongside you all as we work
[8948.81s -> 8953.45s]  tirelessly to ensure that our guests enjoy the most hospitable and memorable experience possible.
[8954.17s -> 8960.25s]  I write this with a heavy heart. This hotel has become my home. It's staff and patrons,
[8960.25s -> 8971.67s]  my family. I miss you all dearly. He's a ghost. He's a ghost. All right. Well, that's all we can do
[8971.67s -> 8986.60s]  here. No shit. What do you mean no shit? He could have been like a ghoul. He might have been a ghost.
[8986.60s -> 9000.68s]  He could have, I guess he is very clearly a ghost. I gotta get rid of the green. But he might have
[9000.68s -> 9013.02s]  just been a guy. No, he wasn't a guy. Is there another way up here? Blocked, blocked, blocked,
[9013.02s -> 9027.62s]  blocked, blocked, blocked. We have new dialogue. I'm begun cleaning and already I feel a renewed
[9027.62s -> 9033.38s]  lightness of spirit. That's the power of positive thinking. Actually, I cleared out some of the
[9033.38s -> 9040.76s]  clutter for you. Oh yes, thank you. Please relax and let the hotel staff handle it. You fool. You're
[9040.76s -> 9049.96s]  losing her. Guests don't want to spend their time cleaning. Are you okay? Yeah. This is the finest
[9049.96s -> 9056.94s]  hotel you're ever going to visit. How could I let my problems pile up like this? And there's how we
[9056.94s -> 9067.21s]  go. One, two, I'll go down. Goodbye. We're looking for green. If I can remove the green, then we
[9067.21s -> 9078.70s]  should be fine. That's a chest. I'll try to get it. Wait, are you sure this is a ghost? Maybe he can
[9078.70s -> 9107.50s]  just float. Okay. I have to squish myself. I'm just going to grab a hold of this. It's very lucky.
[9107.50s -> 9122.58s]  And I got a hole. Ah, you got to go slow. Sometimes the levels are slow. What's that?
[9124.34s -> 9137.69s]  Oh, when you slow me down, that's when I have a problem. When you take it, when you take me down
[9137.69s -> 9150.65s]  a notch and I have to go very slowly. Look at how much of a problem this causes. And I tried to dash
[9150.65s -> 9172.38s]  off the screen. I guess, should I have gone down? Nope, it's a secret. Well, gotta get back. So, um,
[9173.66s -> 9199.88s]  fuck. I think I have to go all the way around. I don't, why am I doing that? What are you guys doing?
[9204.95s -> 9229.54s]  Why? Why? What are you doing? What are you doing? That doesn't make any sense. That doesn't make any
[9229.54s -> 9254.82s]  sense. Who came up with that? You guys are throwing me off. God damn it. I can't jump on those.
[9256.02s -> 9275.83s]  Stop jumping on them. You threw me off. So hardcore. Don't blame us. Well, when I look over
[9275.83s -> 9280.95s]  in my chat and all I see is people talking about how they're fucking farting and shit. Like,
[9281.51s -> 9292.76s]  it's going to throw me off a little. It's going to fuck me up a little bit. Just don't touch
[9292.76s -> 9299.06s]  anything on the ground and then grab this dash, get over here. What the fuck just happened? What?
[9299.86s -> 9319.34s]  You guys are fucking kidding me. Pat's fault. Chat's fault. I mean, come on. I mean, look,
[9319.34s -> 9344.98s]  it's not chat's fault. It just is. I definitely did not do that correctly at all. I'll take it
[9344.98s -> 9395.42s]  though. What are you doing? Oh my God. You guys really going to do this shit? I made it. Left.
[9395.42s -> 9415.06s]  Buried. Well, I think I have to. Come on, move. I didn't even press X. I didn't, I swear.
[9417.74s -> 9429.42s]  Whatever. Let's just see if I can time this right. Nope. This is like one of the easiest rooms and
[9429.42s -> 9435.75s]  for some reason I just, I can't do it. I'm so desperately trying to go as fast as I can and
[9435.75s -> 9439.51s]  I got meat boy syndrome, which remember, if you don't know what meat boy syndrome is,
[9440.07s -> 9445.35s]  it's instead of climbing up, you just launch off the wall. So I have this meat boy syndrome
[9445.35s -> 9505.37s]  that I can't get rid of. Dick. No. Fuck. That's it. I had it. Damn. There it is. The Cheshire
[9505.37s -> 9525.11s]  Trest. So that gets rid of all those. The Graham one to go. Wasn't there a blockage over here
[9525.11s -> 9543.32s]  somewhere? I know there was. All right. For the new viewers that are coming in, you guys really
[9543.32s -> 9552.15s]  want this to be the chat experience? Do you want the chat experience? Oh, this is this channel
[9552.15s -> 9559.67s]  I've never heard of. Oh, Jerma985. Let me click on his channel and see what he's doing. Celeste.
[9559.67s -> 9566.07s]  Okay. Cool. So how's he doing in Celeste? Nope. I almost missed that one. You try to get that one
[9566.07s -> 9576.25s]  again. He's farting. I'm farting. I love to fart. Okay. Well, bye. They're going to think you guys
[9576.25s -> 9594.73s]  are bots. Do you guys really want to be bots? Like, I barely enjoyed the luxuries that our
[9594.73s -> 9610.86s]  hotel has to offer. I don't know, man. Viewers are going up. No, they're not. No, they're not.
[9610.86s -> 9628.57s]  They've been the same. You've lost 600. No, I haven't. Have what? Seriously. Seriously. I don't
[9628.57s -> 9637.94s]  know what to say. I missed dialogue. One person wrote that and then everybody decided to jump on
[9637.94s -> 9645.54s]  and just start grabbing it. She hates you. I don't. I'm sorry. Wait, I thought I couldn't hear that.
[9647.35s -> 9651.75s]  Well, I guess because he's a ghost, you can see right through his brain so I can see his words.
[9652.63s -> 9666.63s]  I understand. Well, let me take a look. There is this place that just got open.
[9667.43s -> 9695.56s]  Didn't I already do this one? No. Stop me for it. Hmm. Ferry. Can I get it without dying?
[9697.00s -> 9719.14s]  No. That's dash across. Very clear. Very clear. Gonna fall, grab, dash across. Watch. I ran a dash.
[9719.86s -> 9742.63s]  See? Fall, dash across, grab. I watched you since Scary Face Cam Fridays. Oh yeah, I remember those.
[9743.43s -> 9756.94s]  I do. Shit. Too bad. Scary Face Cam Fridays. I need to pay attention.
[9773.70s -> 9785.99s]  Now what? Bring him back. Guys, there's no such thing as Scary Face Cam Fridays.
[9786.47s -> 9813.21s]  You know why? Because I'm just... shit. What am I doing? I did it on Saturday. Yeah,
[9813.21s -> 9829.93s]  that person's not a true viewer. All right, I'm doing this wrong. No, I fucked it up. Maybe not.
[9830.65s -> 9860.15s]  Holy fuck me. I did it. Holy shit. I hate you. I'm so in love. I'm so in love. You know what I mean?
[9860.15s -> 9876.71s]  I've rented a fucking juice. I missed the thing that I needed and I rented a juice again.
[9877.51s -> 9904.46s]  Fucking ceiling again. Stop hitting the ceiling before I call your parents. I'm calling your
[9904.46s -> 9938.58s]  fucking parents. I'm calling both of your parents at the same time on different cell phones. Oh my
[9938.58s -> 9948.58s]  god. And then I'm going to get them both on the phone and I'm going to put them both on speaker
[9948.58s -> 9960.22s]  and they're going to talk to each other. I'm going to hold one end to the other. I got the game kit.
[9960.54s -> 9981.05s]  Whatever. Cleaned up the house. Good for me. What's going on here? Oh, this is just a clean room.
[9981.77s -> 9998.86s]  They're at work. I'm going to call them. There you are. You certainly have a knack for wandering off.
[9999.74s -> 10006.71s]  It was tough, but I sorted everything out for you. The Celestial Resort Hotel extends its
[10006.71s -> 10012.15s]  gratitude for your assistance. Of course, the staff had the mess under control, Ms. John.
[10013.11s -> 10016.97s]  Oh, sure. Yeah. How humiliating.
[10018.97s -> 10023.85s]  Your pants are unzipped. Actually, thanks for telling me that. Thank you. I'll zip them up.
[10024.49s -> 10037.83s]  It's just up the elevator down the hall. Sure. What the heck. Show me the presidential suite.
[10038.87s -> 10056.39s]  Sounds lovely. Don't lose her now. I hate it. I hate it. I hate this. This is worse than anything
[10056.47s -> 10077.74s]  else. I hate this thing you guys are doing. Man, it's amazing here. How's it going with El Creepo?
[10079.18s -> 10083.42s]  I helped him clean up that huge mess, but he was kind of a jerk. He still thinks he can convince
[10083.42s -> 10091.03s]  me to stay. It's gone seriously. My bad idea radar is off the charts on this one. You should get out
[10091.03s -> 10096.95s]  of here. Emote only mode has been activated. If I disappear now, Mr. Oshiro could have a meltdown
[10096.95s -> 10104.07s]  and maybe I can actually do something good for once. Forget your karma, dude. I think that guy
[10104.07s -> 10109.93s]  is going to melt down no matter what. You have to think about your safety. Theo, I'll be okay.
[10111.08s -> 10114.52s]  Yeah. Yeah. I didn't expect you to listen. See you on the outside. Jail bird.
[10124.50s -> 10145.77s]  Up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. First try guaranteed. No. Holy fuck. First try guaranteed.
[10145.77s -> 10149.77s]  Nope, not first try. I gotta get. I hate it. I hate the thing you guys are doing right now.
[10153.77s -> 10173.45s]  I've lost entirely. I had it too. I just forgot. My brain didn't turn it on. I'm doing this so
[10173.45s -> 10181.86s]  incorrect. No, I wanted to go up, not diagonal. You piece of shit Xbox controller. Why are you
[10181.86s -> 10189.54s]  the worst controller? And why are you the only one that works on fucking Steam? The PS4 controller
[10189.54s -> 10224.70s]  doesn't like to work and you have to unplug it and get like this fucking software. Okay, I know
[10224.70s -> 10228.97s]  what I gotta do. I know what I gotta do. I know what I gotta do. Wait, wait, wait. Don't grab onto
[10228.97s -> 10242.42s]  this. Grab onto the edge here and you can't, you gotta go back down. Why is everybody putting the
[10242.42s -> 10250.89s]  cheese? Should I even ask that question? No, that's it. That's what it is. You gotta dash,
[10250.89s -> 10264.54s]  win right on the edge. This, right on the edge. Got it. Bingo. Oh shit. Oh my God. I didn't even
[10264.54s -> 10283.83s]  see what was at the end of this level. Stupid Xbox controller. Hey, are you sure you don't want to
[10283.83s -> 10291.75s]  go? Hey, when you press and press left on d-pad and sometimes just press, press all 180 degrees
[10291.75s -> 10303.42s]  left down up and every, the whole side, do the whole thing. Did you not want to do that? Did you
[10303.42s -> 10332.50s]  want, you didn't want to do that. Sorry. That'll be $80 per controller please. I didn't do that.
[10332.50s -> 10353.21s]  I didn't do that. Why do you, didn't, I pressed left. Doesn't even, yes, no.
[10354.36s -> 10374.94s]  Give me that strawberry. By the way, listen to these. You know how annoying it is to play a game
[10374.94s -> 10407.32s]  that requires you to press R1 or L1 more than once every few seconds? Fucking Xbox. Cool Xbox. See,
[10407.48s -> 10435.06s]  like 2030 when crackdown comes up. I'm being, I'm being mean to Xbox right now.
[10435.78s -> 10451.35s]  Why are you being so mean to Xbox? Big bits. We got big bits. Big bits. Pugatron. Give $30.
[10454.34s -> 10457.86s]  Thank you so much for the 30 bucks. Hey, love you, German. Thanks for being such a great
[10457.86s -> 10461.70s]  entertainer. Thank you. Thanks for hanging out. We're just having fun. That's all we do.
[10462.34s -> 10475.59s]  This is your last chance, Oshiro, but thank you so much for the $30. You already ruined it,
[10475.59s -> 10481.35s]  making a guest clean up your mess. I don't hate the Xbox. I don't hate the Xbox. I just hate the
[10481.35s -> 10487.43s]  console. I hate the controller. I hate the games and I hate the internet connection and I hate the
[10487.43s -> 10505.37s]  UI. Something I don't hate the Xbox. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. You're already
[10505.37s -> 10511.80s]  making a guest clean up your mess. She'll never stay. She's still here. There's still a chance.
[10512.76s -> 10521.38s]  Did I just get banned for making a fart joke? That's a banned word now.
[10522.87s -> 10529.03s]  Presidential Suite is the key. It will surely impress her. Get it together, Oshiro. Wait,
[10531.40s -> 10551.03s]  but he's doing this. There you are. Follow me quickly. We're almost there. I have a confession
[10551.03s -> 10561.72s]  to make. I actually like the layout of the Xbox controller. I prefer the layout to the PS4.
[10562.52s -> 10580.31s]  It's true. That actually is true. This guy keeps smashing me. I literally got banned for saying
[10580.31s -> 10594.55s]  fart peepee. Well, maybe you shouldn't be saying fart peepee. Well, you guys just let me enjoy my
[10594.55s -> 10617.69s]  pizza. Shit. That's what you have to do though. And I fucking blew it. I blew it so bad. I gotta
[10617.69s -> 10628.17s]  leave the last couple of pixels. I gotta get. I am going to get angry. No, I'm not. Why? This
[10628.17s -> 10649.00s]  game's fun. I'm not actually getting angry at anything in this game. Come on. Come on.
[10649.96s -> 10658.04s]  Stand still. Got it. Wait, sub only? Sometimes we have to go to sub only because people write fart.
[10658.04s -> 10663.08s]  Farts are like I'm farting. It's the only thing that I get to see in chat and we're gonna. We're
[10663.08s -> 10680.84s]  gonna sour. I don't. You gotta stop bringing it up. When people are asking why am I getting like
[10680.84s -> 10706.30s]  timed out and they write the thing. I have to answer it. I have to tell them why. Berry up there.
[10706.30s -> 10723.53s]  Two berries, really? Have and then climb. Very fast. No, no. Have it right the first time.
[10724.25s -> 10738.01s]  To climb over and then dash and then jump around dash again and land over here. There's two berries
[10738.01s -> 10771.43s]  right now. I can't just not get them. Just land. Just land and you'll get it. Co-op juke. Nice.
[10786.55s -> 10801.90s]  Baby gate. What's the baby gate? Open the baby gate. I just itched the back of my head really fast.
[10801.90s -> 10809.54s]  That's how you know that things are starting to heat up. Big time. I just ruined everything. I have
[10809.54s -> 10816.60s]  to dash across. I can't use this dash. You slow stupid idiot. Like you fucking. Look at how slow
[10816.60s -> 10853.58s]  that guy is in comparison to the other one. I think that's all I can do down here. I gotta go back up.
[10854.68s -> 10867.93s]  Yes. This way and I came from this way. I gotta get a key. Let's go over here and get the key.
[10868.89s -> 10881.00s]  Madder than Hotline Miami. That is that is so far from the truth. I'm having a visit rate.
[10881.88s -> 10902.44s]  Well I have to dash through. It's my own fault. Key that there's a secret and there's something
[10902.44s -> 10916.02s]  over here. Do I keep this key forever? God I hope so. I do. I gotta time that to jump when it comes up.
[10918.10s -> 10927.29s]  Oh shit. I get it. I get it. Oh my god. I had it right there. That was done.
[10928.25s -> 10962.01s]  I get it. I get it. I get it. And I just pressed A for no reason. For no reason. There wasn't any
[10962.01s -> 10970.15s]  reason to press A. You just slide down. I itched my fucking nose. I have like birds up there. I
[10970.15s -> 10984.76s]  don't know what's in there. Why is my nose so itchy right now? Why is my nose so itchy? Yeah.
[10985.72s -> 10994.28s]  I okay does anybody else get like this? When you play a game that requires your
[10995.00s -> 11002.52s]  complete immediate 100% focus do you go into a spell of where a place on your body starts to itch
[11003.58s -> 11014.34s]  and you can't it doesn't stop. I don't know why. What's it for? Why does that mean? Does that mean
[11014.34s -> 11023.83s]  like somebody's talking about you? You know you sneeze and people say oh that means somebody just
[11023.83s -> 11036.47s]  talked shit about you. Gotta b-side. 3000 people are talking about you. Well stop because my nose
[11036.47s -> 11045.19s]  is itchy. Mr. Oshiro's diary. The final entry appears to be decades old. As of today the hotel
[11045.19s -> 11050.39s]  is officially closed. Charlotte organized the staff for a farewell hike up the mountain. Most
[11050.39s -> 11055.19s]  of us have never seen the summit. It seemed like a fitting goodbye but when the time came I couldn't
[11055.19s -> 11066.46s]  bear to leave without looking around one last time. I told them to go on without me. I will
[11066.46s -> 11070.78s]  catch up with them soon after I double check that everything is in order. I can't believe my time
[11070.78s -> 11077.35s]  here is over. What am I gonna do now? Perhaps I'll stay one last night so that the hotel and I can
[11077.35s -> 11100.68s]  have a proper goodbye. All right what what is going on in this chat today? What's going on here?
[11104.71s -> 11109.43s]  Somebody like sawed open chat's head and like threw up into their brain and then closed it.

[12266.07s -> 12275.19s]  doesn't consume stamina oh that's pretty good idea fluffy clouds looks like it's a jumping
[12275.19s -> 12292.82s]  mechanic new mechanic introduced into shito i mean celeste what about down there's an orb
[12296.86s -> 12308.44s]  oh bubble mechanic oops so you can aim it so you have to aim it in a direction so if i jump in
[12309.77s -> 12318.02s]  i come out with a dash can i jump out of this i wonder if i can jump out doesn't look like it
[12318.02s -> 12354.17s]  but i still have a dash when i'm outside okay good to know that's pretty cool come on i'm
[12354.17s -> 12361.13s]  making a reference to mario 3 any other boomers in this chat get it you probably do you probably
[12361.13s -> 12375.30s]  went oh all right yeah i remember that little tune oh yeah it's me oh well well i didn't expect to
[12375.30s -> 12381.62s]  see you up here i'm glad you're still in one piece so you made it to the hotel did you meet
[12381.62s -> 12388.42s]  mr ashura i did oh well i met him all right he chased me out of there after i cleaned up a bunch
[12388.42s -> 12402.12s]  of junk that sounds like a fun morning he's a lost soul dear that place is much more than just a hotel
[12402.12s -> 12408.63s]  to him don't make him your project you know what i think i think this mountain drove both of you
[12408.63s -> 12418.46s]  crazy you know you're not the first person to say that maybe you're right how would i
[12418.46s -> 12424.30s]  know if i were crazy the way i see it the mountain can't bring out anything that isn't already in you
[12426.76s -> 12431.24s]  but you gotta be a few crows short of a murder to live up here in the first place right
[12434.25s -> 12440.17s]  what are you even talking about oh i'm just rambling like the old bad i am ready to give
[12440.17s -> 12451.06s]  up i know shortcut back to your car back off lady i'm heading for the summit sometimes it's
[12451.06s -> 12456.02s]  hard to tell the difference between stubbornness and determination isn't it you remind me of myself
[12456.02s -> 12467.02s]  when i was young good luck and mind the wind you don't get many visitors up here do you
[12467.98s -> 12472.78s]  no i can't say that i do i don't mind the solitude though sometimes i think i should
[12472.78s -> 12478.22s]  live in solitude too i really tried to get through to mr ashura i wanted to help him
[12479.58s -> 12483.74s]  sure needs to move on from that hotel but it's not going to happen on your schedule
[12484.30s -> 12489.90s]  and doesn't help that you've got something to prove i'm talking very strangely i don't know why
[12489.90s -> 12492.54s]  i'm doing this i don't know you know what am i doing this why am i saying it like this why am i
[12492.54s -> 12507.78s]  doing this why am i doing that arrow pointing up you've got an arrow that's pointing look at
[12507.78s -> 12523.45s]  that arrow right there pointing up for what it's very clearly an arrow right there look see
[12524.17s -> 12533.77s]  where my head is hitting don't you get lonely in that little cabin i have friends dear i may be
[12533.77s -> 12540.49s]  crazy but i'm not a hermit sorry i didn't mean to assume when i was younger i couldn't imagine
[12540.49s -> 12545.37s]  staying in one place for this long but then i found this mountain i knew right away that it
[12545.37s -> 12552.01s]  would be my home what's so special about it the mountain shows you who you really are
[12553.05s -> 12564.57s]  whether you're ready for it or not it keeps me honest isn't that interesting that just
[12564.57s -> 12582.06s]  interesting too much wind no i don't like this those are spikes i thought they were just frozen
[12582.06s -> 12611.02s]  cactuses but i'm wrong there are no cactuses in canada wait can i go okay these can be broken
[12611.98s -> 12627.66s]  donkey kong barrels nice nothing else i can do about this little secrets
[12631.67s -> 12637.50s]  oh that's does it come back oops a daisy
[12647.77s -> 12658.10s]  more wind more wind you know this game uh it's like dark souls in a way with uh
[12658.98s -> 12677.03s]  i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm just being annoying oh actually i don't have a dash stop right now
[12678.23s -> 12680.87s]  yeah i don't know about the way that the uh you know you die
[12681.99s -> 12691.40s]  and it's you're supposed to lose a bunch of times it's kind of it makes sense oh man you gotta go
[12691.40s -> 12736.46s]  faster than that to get this really really really i didn't even point and grab the ledge
[12747.45s -> 12760.70s]  easiest barrier the whole game right there official death counter five out of 75 575 deaths
[12761.50s -> 12777.14s]  that's not bad for a playthrough one is it not bad that's not bad something down here we got we

[12861.51s -> 12866.15s]  great goddamn channel over there please link it one of the mods link that channel
[12868.82s -> 12873.51s]  by the way i need to figure out what the hell i'm doing here do i have a time limit on when i can
[12873.51s -> 12895.94s]  order it up to a certain order i don't think i'm getting this maybe it does have to be in a
[12895.94s -> 12898.98s]  certain order or if they go fast enough or they can't but they don't touch me
[12901.66s -> 12910.12s]  joel got timed out how what yeah i have to go fast they can't touch me he posted the link and
[12910.12s -> 12928.23s]  got banned no he didn't oh god let's start at the top left here where's the sounds he did because
[12928.23s -> 12933.75s]  he's not a sub i'm sorry i didn't mean to time i didn't mean for the automatic bot to time you up
[12934.47s -> 12951.85s]  wait still here you were supposed to learn this in chapter two but you skipped it like a dumb ass
[12952.73s -> 12957.18s]  what do you mean like what do you hold on what do you mean like a dumb ass
[12957.18s -> 12977.82s]  because i went a different way what uh so i can't touch the ground exactly that does not count as
[12977.82s -> 12999.37s]  the floor so i probably start up here then the thing is you got yeah the grip thing is really
[12999.37s -> 13011.21s]  gonna fuck me over here because i can't have to touch the ground so i gotta wait till the wind
[13011.77s -> 13016.65s]  that's how you do this i bet does this count as the ground this doesn't count as the ground it
[13016.65s -> 13039.02s]  does it well i wasn't not collecting this wind is killing me here so how the hell am i gonna get
[13039.02s -> 13071.11s]  this one dash through well i think that's what i have to do i was on the right track here maybe
[13071.11s -> 13079.67s]  this is this one's uh i feel like i have to dash to get this one dashing with the wind or get it
[13079.67s -> 13101.45s]  absolutely last let's try it again okay yeah i gotta get this one and then this one last i
[13101.45s -> 13120.57s]  shouldn't be dashing at all except for to get this one fuck i'm gonna get it it's possible ah
[13121.37s -> 13140.84s]  if i had a dash it was impossible all right let me take a look so
[13142.28s -> 13167.27s]  maybe if i drop down i shouldn't be dashing ran in the dash again this is celeste if you're
[13167.27s -> 13188.94s]  wondering if you're curious what the game is what if i get this one first that may have just done it
[13189.50s -> 13202.15s]  because i can reset it every time over here all right that should be it right
[13203.03s -> 13216.78s]  as long as i can get over here got it i thought i was gonna run out of grips all right that was
[13216.78s -> 13221.51s]  fun interesting so you gotta get them all before touching the ground cool it just took me a little
[13221.51s -> 13236.25s]  while step two oh god welcome to hell this is gonna take a long no it's not i'll get it first try
[13236.25s -> 13259.66s]  guaranteed where i'll delete my twitch channel right now it's still the first track thank god
[13259.66s -> 13270.70s]  i don't have to delete my twitch channel another b-side tape very cool can i go anywhere else
[13273.96s -> 13283.80s]  looks like i can go up but can i really though jeal nine thanks for the 10 community subs jeal
[13283.80s -> 13299.75s]  nine you guys have given so many community subs tonight jeal thank you nothing up here anyways
[13302.81s -> 13323.22s]  jeal all right fight the wind i got my berry i got the tape i just have to guess where it is
[13324.68s -> 13332.44s]  just guess correctly this time oh my god what are you thinking why can i not do this
[13333.98s -> 13349.35s]  what the fuck am i doing almost soiled it there but i got it all right berry right there don't do it
[13349.35s -> 13356.20s]  like that there's no reason to do it like that all right climb probably have to time this to when it's
[13356.20s -> 13369.90s]  not snowing i mean windy you know what i mean if i go the other way no that was it i had it
[13370.30s -> 13392.18s]  oh i think i have to hold on and not do the dash maybe not i gotta wait for the
[13392.18s -> 13398.89s]  wind has to blow me back that way okay i get it so we how much let's count it ready one
[13399.61s -> 13415.22s]  two three one two three one two three one one two three oh my god you gotta go when the wind is
[13415.22s -> 13432.31s]  blowing right when it starts get it come on blow it's close never really i really had it there too
[13435.90s -> 13447.88s]  i'll get it i know it's right i have it just fucking xbox controller
[13458.68s -> 13480.02s]  do it i didn't even need the wind didn't even need it bite controller no no biting spikes
[13480.82s -> 13502.79s]  very two berries okay i would assume that's probably correct it is correct if i could just
[13502.79s -> 13525.86s]  do it there's one and that's not how you get that one how do you get that let me see hold on
[13526.42s -> 13546.87s]  is there a way to go up from here well this is blocked off now let's try this way it's different
[13552.54s -> 13553.34s]  oh shit
[13570.07s -> 13582.74s]  um okay well you this can be controlled with my mind to break that
[13584.25s -> 13591.86s]  maybe not i have to go all the way up and then all the way down
[13594.14s -> 13625.30s]  apparently i guess maybe i do have to break it no i don't oh i have to control this too shit
[13627.51s -> 13663.54s]  come with me i forgot to press the button this is it this right holy shit okay just let go man
[13663.54s -> 13685.48s]  just let go i didn't even hold i didn't hold right trigger i'm so angry just do it man i really am
[13685.48s -> 13710.44s]  just trying to jeremy i'm not gonna ask you to do this again it's really that wasn't that hard you
[13710.44s -> 13722.49s]  just had to do it all right got all the berries that's it you're grounded jeremy you're grounded
[13728.38s -> 13743.38s]  any other ways to go there is what we're looking at there's a way to go to the top right this is
[13743.38s -> 13763.06s]  gonna be a pain in the ass i can already tell oh my god holy shit there's a spike so nothing
[13763.06s -> 13772.25s]  not it's a that's a level is done good good for you got it what there is how do i get up there
[13772.25s -> 13787.94s]  there's gonna be a way right jump on here and then fall maybe no because i don't think i can
[13787.94s -> 13813.46s]  reach no i can't reach oh fuck how do i can i get that to move nice all right so this is the water
[13814.26s -> 13830.02s]  why do i always play a game a year after release i mean do i do that i just i play games and i don't
[13830.02s -> 13836.06s]  have to play a game at all here's this is a i guarantee it as a reference here what the
[13836.06s -> 13859.43s]  fuck did i tell you i knew it so what do i do with this yep everybody talked shit when i made
[13859.43s -> 13873.98s]  the flute noise and there's the reference right there and i got it first try your boomer brain
[13873.98s -> 13884.74s]  helped uh this is gonna be interesting okay i gotta go and then jump on this before it crashes in
[13884.74s -> 13906.57s]  maybe i have to do that first can is that even possible holy shit man got it so that's another
[13907.21s -> 13927.82s]  cool i didn't go up though interesting ow i never played super mario 3 so it took me 20 minutes to
[13927.82s -> 13935.50s]  figure that out if you have that's just a white block why would you ever know what to do if you
[13935.50s -> 13952.06s]  never even heard of it oh this is on track i can't move it oh shit i just have to go the other way i
[13952.06s -> 13972.81s]  had it whoops that's gonna screw the whole thing up isn't it jex it what is jex it
[13981.03s -> 14031.54s]  don't act like i don't know shit no the wind really is tough why did i scream in your ears i'm
[14031.54s -> 14041.19s]  sorry because i'm an awful streamer and i forget the how loud noises hurt all right this is an
[14041.19s -> 14049.75s]  interesting scenario here i jump fall down dash up that i knew i figured the wind would have carried
[14049.75s -> 14076.49s]  me there that's what you gotta do it's close i'll get it patience myself patience i'm giving it some
[14076.49s -> 14089.94s]  pretty decent patience here all right so then it's just fall grab hi we love you no matter how loud
[14089.94s -> 14105.61s]  you scream maybe i should just get the bubble no are you calmly mad or just mad i'm just calm
[14106.49s -> 14128.30s]  i'm just enjoying the video game got it yikes okay that was got it nothing else just fall
[14128.86s -> 14142.46s]  hold on oh no oh no go up to the top quick up this game is surprisingly calm and cozy
[14143.18s -> 14187.62s]  despite how tough it is yeah it is up maybe anything no ice cactus again i did it again
[14188.10s -> 14214.34s]  okay shit now i got it wind is going the other direction now yeah typically i would play a game
[14214.34s -> 14221.05s]  like this for only a few hours at a time because they can really just get inside your brain
[14222.25s -> 14238.47s]  gotta go up but i'm still this is still i like it oops from here uh ride the platform with a
[14238.47s -> 14257.35s]  bubble and then bubble up i just freaked out because oh shit what i thought i was gonna need
[14257.35s -> 14268.09s]  to jump it's gonna put me right here perfect that's what you gotta do you gotta just that's
[14268.09s -> 14285.77s]  what you gotta do oh what all right i'm gonna pantomime something and i want you to know i want
[14285.77s -> 14319.90s]  you to guess what it is okay no i'm not it was the xbox controller surprise i don't have that's not
[14319.90s -> 14332.46s]  what pantomime means yeah well i was gonna do it but i decided against it did i ruin it
[14334.90s -> 14364.94s]  no i'd rather i would rather die than have to do that an xbox uh looks like i'm going this way
[14365.58s -> 14392.84s]  because i have to let's think this through let me see what happens when i touch this
[14392.84s -> 14397.80s]  right okay right right okay we gotta catch it on the way back
[14397.80s -> 14406.42s]  okay
[14411.21s -> 14420.63s]  no right right right right right right what you gotta do and i'm just not getting i that's what
[14420.63s -> 14441.46s]  you gotta do you gotta do it quick bingo one you gotta that's not what you gotta do you have to
[14441.46s -> 14473.32s]  grab the edge i gotta grab the edge you fucking got it idiot come in oh it's not possible without
[14473.32s -> 14502.63s]  thing yes it is don't ever tell me that's not possible it's not possible oh go down this
[14503.67s -> 14529.78s]  okay go ahead i gotta go ahead right i would have had it bring it up good very good very good very
[14529.78s -> 14560.25s]  good so pretty this is a very pretty game isn't it i agree probably should hold on secret no wait
[14560.25s -> 14572.86s]  can i go up gotta check for secrets it's possible this one's up here i don't know
[14573.90s -> 14598.30s]  you gotta check down down right in video game controllers man i swear
[14601.29s -> 14628.17s]  there's a huge it's a it's a big conspiracy i think what the fuck are you what's happening
[14628.17s -> 14663.21s]  to the controller i swear to god oh man i did it and no fruit there's a hole right here though
[14663.77s -> 14694.06s]  just take a look this looks like hell sure let's do it have you tried turning on the controller
[14694.78s -> 14709.53s]  it's one thing i actually haven't tried is turning it on i'm using my teeth like all right very
[14709.53s -> 14746.50s]  clearly i have to jump off and you also have to pull it and i jumped over it running out of gas
[14746.50s -> 14777.40s]  here running out of gas i'm gonna be on the other side just covered in fucking water just sweating
[14777.40s -> 14790.06s]  my ass off my hands are sweating i'm like a dog you know a dog doesn't sweat the only sweats
[14790.06s -> 14795.72s]  take through his mouth i don't i didn't even know i didn't even know and i would have known if i
[14795.72s -> 14804.36s]  known i would have known i i i'm sweating through my hands right now it's the only part that's
[14804.36s -> 14825.77s]  sweating can i get it oh i'm so happy drink from your hands i'm not sure that's a good idea
[14832.36s -> 14849.67s]  very you probably have to just dash only because jumping is not gonna help i don't think
[14854.12s -> 14876.23s]  shit you gotta get to the very edge try hitting jump and that i didn't know you could do this
[14877.11s -> 14895.00s]  you just you can ask this actual dash jumping new mechanic and i didn't even learn it somebody told
[14895.00s -> 14913.53s]  me about it just do it oh just do it hold on sorry guys i have to get the the layer of oil off my
[14913.53s -> 14941.38s]  hands how's that for a gamer challenge my hands are covered in like oil hold on no no i turned
[14941.38s -> 14949.51s]  on the camera and it stopped that's gonna haunt me for three days now i'm not gonna be able to
[14949.51s -> 14983.29s]  sneeze for three days fuck why did i do that wind wind no it's not enough why is it not letting me
[14983.29s -> 15006.41s]  jump up is this because the wind i don't think i can do this from right now i can holy shit you
[15006.41s -> 15025.93s]  got it oh boy you gotta go fast my hands are falling off the controller god face the snowball
[15026.65s -> 15040.06s]  this sucks i hate this wind i hate the wind i don't like the wind i'm playing tug of war with the
[15040.06s -> 15067.05s]  video game right now oh fuck itchy face stop it just go what am i doing that's all right i got
[15067.05s -> 15094.58s]  the berry oh i didn't have a jump didn't have a jump i thought i had one still all right something
[15094.58s -> 15100.62s]  i gotta remember that uses a dash maybe that it's not just like a fancy jump it's actually dashing
[15101.58s -> 15129.00s]  i almost died i think it didn't this is the guy that beat dark souls on stream yep one of the only
[15129.00s -> 15177.72s]  ones i have to jump on them this is such extreme when oh no oh i had it was so close
[15178.60s -> 15214.10s]  this is the hardest level in the whole game they fall to oh i've overshot it that would have been
[15214.10s -> 15241.03s]  it too i had it thank god i don't have a face cam on right now you can see what i'm doing
[15241.03s -> 15273.94s]  this is the longest i've spent on leveling it's probably this is probably one of the easiest
[15274.58s -> 15287.54s]  slides in the whole game and i'm still here my fucking god
[15294.57s -> 15307.42s]  all right did it i just beat the easiest slide in the game don't do diagonal uh blame phil spencer
[15308.06s -> 15314.66s]  it's his fault because he owns these controllers and they're his all of them he sells them out of
[15314.66s -> 15333.08s]  his fucking truck in his house he makes them in his spare time oh did the truck no no no no
[15333.24s -> 15349.99s]  oh my god oh it's too much i feel like i'm getting the wind blowing on me in real life
[15357.45s -> 15403.48s]  do it i was doing now i'm going real fast i jumped over how did i jump over i can't believe i had
[15412.57s -> 15434.14s]  oh i just to go underneath it what the fuck not i think i'm just doing it wrong let me sit here
[15434.14s -> 15463.70s]  okay got it i win john wait up what i nailed it this is the most comical character
[15464.42s -> 15478.54s]  theo you all right yeah just give me a second a gondola i've always wanted to ride one of these
[15479.58s -> 15483.34s]  it looks pretty old but maybe it still works i don't see any other way to cross this
[15484.22s -> 15486.92s]  chasm let's do it
[15491.27s -> 15502.57s]  this lever looks important easy every time i was probably going to go to the operator in a past
[15502.57s -> 15512.14s]  life do you think this is safe i'm sure it's fine how to check out with oshiro
[15514.70s -> 15518.06s]  i shouldn't have tried to help him because i told you so but
[15518.70s -> 15524.38s]  i should have listened they didn't get hurt and that's what matters
[15528.07s -> 15538.90s]  local boomer can't beat children's platformer i can barely breathe that's bullshit that you know
[15538.90s -> 15548.15s]  that it's not even like that what okay if we don't get a selfie on this thing we're going to regret it
[15549.83s -> 15555.45s]  i can't even see the ground through the mist this is not a children's platformer i know and
[15555.45s -> 15563.18s]  you're gonna have to explain that to i don't even know who said it i just read it how high up are we
[15564.54s -> 15580.81s]  less panicking more posing looks like we stalled out this guy's always taking selfies
[15582.95s -> 15588.58s]  maybe if i you broke it
[15594.74s -> 15608.74s]  dark world oh this really isn't good you cool oh no i'm not cool i can't breathe
[15609.78s -> 15614.02s]  you're having a panic attack why would you think it's a good idea to ride this stupid thing
[15614.82s -> 15620.38s]  don't take it out on me stay with me my grandpa taught me a trick for this close your eyes
[15623.06s -> 15630.79s]  picture a feather floating in front of you see it okay your breathing keeps that feather floating
[15632.41s -> 15656.58s]  just breathe slow and steady in and out am i supposed to do this oh it's x a i have to match
[15656.58s -> 15672.09s]  this i don't know i i don't know how to calm down okay i'm trying i know i have to keep it
[15672.09s -> 15703.29s]  in the box but there we go nice and easy did i win i mean i'm not really breathing very well here
[15703.29s -> 15732.20s]  look at i'm going like i should be going see easy feeling any better i think so thanks for helping
[15732.20s -> 15737.77s]  me calm down how did you know we were gonna start moving again
[15739.37s -> 15749.34s]  oh i totally thought we were done for but there is no there's a raid up here
[15750.58s -> 15755.51s]  uh there's a rare charizard and i gotta get the gym up here i'm sorry what were you saying
[15757.67s -> 15782.47s]  lol lol whoa that's a crazy selfie technically so who took this picture is what i want to know
[15785.34s -> 15806.97s]  scary right we don't ever find out who that is shit almost looks like we're almost at the
[15806.97s -> 15823.21s]  summit right we got maybe a couple more worlds mirror temple chapter five not close
[15829.29s -> 15842.60s]  not even close to it said there are seven total chapters plus one bonus okay i wonder if i should
[15842.60s -> 15848.14s]  break this into two streams what do you think tomorrow two go for like another all right so
[15848.14s -> 15855.80s]  if i go for like another hour right so would that be like two like five to six two like six
[15855.80s -> 15860.92s]  hour streams two five hour streams back to back that makes sense right the end worlds are really
[15860.92s -> 15881.80s]  long okay so after this chapter call it and finish it tomorrow and do the tapes too bonus
[15881.80s -> 15888.94s]  worlds and b-sides okay we'll see where we're at in like another hour so we'll just take a look
[15888.94s -> 15896.70s]  oh man look at this place feeling adventurous i don't know you're not going to do the tapes in
[15896.70s -> 15903.74s]  one stream well i mean i don't plan i plan on trying to do some of them looks pretty dark in
[15903.74s -> 15909.74s]  there more like a nightmare than an adventure i'll just take a quick i thought he was gonna say
[15909.74s -> 15914.62s]  selfie oh he that is what he said he is gonna take some pictures this place must be ancient
[15915.90s -> 15926.50s]  the oh wait my insta pics followers are gonna eat this up you won't do the tapes in one stream
[15929.30s -> 15934.36s]  i mean i don't really have an intention to i would try to do a one or two of them or three
[15934.36s -> 15940.60s]  of them or all of them in like 45 minutes it takes about two minutes per level two minutes per level
[15941.40s -> 15945.72s]  five levels per side two four six eight ten twelve yeah i'll beat it in probably like 14 minutes
[15950.25s -> 15965.66s]  secrets no this place is interesting looking i like the foot sounds that kind of glass sound sounds
[15965.66s -> 15981.30s]  good uh i don't have a there okay so there's a mechanic i can just squish that that like
[15985.10s -> 15999.67s]  whoa so they activate when i activate boy interesting stuff mirror oh this is tio's
[15999.67s -> 16006.73s]  phone don't panic john maybe it just fell out of his pocket i'll give it back to him when i find him
[16006.73s -> 16019.26s]  that's a cool mechanic i like it secret right here new bubble is red is that okay it does
[16019.26s -> 16028.01s]  mean something let's say up oh boy left
[16033.29s -> 16050.98s]  shit nope that ain't gonna work shit i can get it i gotta just jump from left right i got this
[16054.01s -> 16059.78s]  now what do i go how do i get out of here shit can't get out of here i have to have a dash
[16060.74s -> 16093.80s]  so what's the progress route here what are those crystals doing that blue crystal just lit up when
[16093.80s -> 16109.48s]  i touched it i have to light them all up because look see i definitely have to light these all up
[16109.48s -> 16126.84s]  there's no way i don't that one i think that's all of them no not on this side i got them right
[16127.64s -> 16142.04s]  is that just for show those just actually don't do anything you don't have to light them up okay
[16145.50s -> 16146.06s]  whoa
[16153.32s -> 16170.87s]  shit all right i figure i got it i got it i got it i don't know what to do sit up i'm it's this
[16170.87s -> 16183.30s]  it's the dash it's screwing my face up oh my god jeremy you're gonna drive me crazy
[16183.78s -> 16196.57s]  oh
[16201.51s -> 16215.99s]  jeremy is what he named his xbox controller
[16229.03s -> 16231.27s]  it is trust me it is i know what it's watching
[16233.67s -> 16235.74s]  this one's so easy just watch
[16237.82s -> 16265.78s]  now for this one there's enough spring on it all right so what are you doing
[16266.98s -> 16267.86s]  shit i had it
[16270.63s -> 16300.12s]  oh i didn't even need to do that real talk strawberries are the best berries
[16300.12s -> 16305.19s]  you know i might actually i might agree with that but i don't think so
[16310.38s -> 16333.35s]  well that's how you think okay it's that easy apparently this is my first time watching this
[16333.35s -> 16355.96s]  stream i won't be coming back oh well i'm sorry sorry i told you guys to behave we didn't do
[16355.96s -> 16377.10s]  anything it must have been the smell same deal this way can i make it over here
[16382.38s -> 16383.86s]  oh geez okay
[16387.26s -> 16387.76s]  i get it
[16391.93s -> 16392.43s]  no i don't
[16400.36s -> 16415.82s]  both sides are open more berries i get it i get a jump though i know you can do it
[16416.38s -> 16423.38s]  i'm certain i know you can do this you know you can do it
[16425.64s -> 16468.81s]  i know i just figured it out i give them just slowing down
[16471.29s -> 16490.62s]  i'm just slowing down remember this is the gamer fatigue
[16492.22s -> 16496.38s]  gamer fatigue sets in and you start to kind of just make the fucking dumb mistake
[16497.50s -> 16509.21s]  why am i going anywhere that didn't go because i went left i went right can't go down
[16509.77s -> 16533.16s]  up go the other side down here i already did this one down i think i got everything here didn't i
[16536.28s -> 16542.68s]  dude gamer fatigue sets in and then you start to make dumb mistakes and you need to go eat like a
[16542.68s -> 16567.02s]  snack i'm just gonna leave so how do i leave that's a great question because this is the
[16567.02s -> 16584.60s]  point straight up isn't that just called regular fatigue no no no it's different
[16590.31s -> 16599.13s]  come on i can grab the edge
[16605.62s -> 16621.88s]  come on i didn't jump slowing down gamer fatigue sets in oh fuck sorry i got
[16625.53s -> 16637.56s]  that one nothing else over there right uh-huh i'm gonna have to get in a bubble to go through
[16637.56s -> 16643.11s]  that one i think bubble from the other side there's gonna be a bubble on the all the way
[16643.11s -> 16653.42s]  to the edge i'm gonna bubble my way over there oops i see uh can i get through that is it a
[16653.42s -> 16668.01s]  secret it's not oops you know you could just duck jerry bane that is a possibility all right so
[16668.97s -> 16677.35s]  i'm gonna take that out so that one goes straight out let me get the cherry here first though
[16678.23s -> 16683.59s]  back
[16696.02s -> 16703.93s]  i was trying to donkey kong it probably still can i i i know i can do it trust me
[16712.02s -> 16727.59s]  all the way through go go go go go up so introducing blades there's the key
[16732.20s -> 16736.12s]  and a secret but not really because i didn't get the thing that was necessary
[16737.00s -> 16748.23s]  i didn't hit another button somehow shit i got a great question for all you guys watching
[16748.23s -> 16765.40s]  where in the name of god is the door that this key goes to i forget can i get that
[16778.52s -> 16785.16s]  oh i see i see that okay i don't think i can i get reliably back in there that's gonna be
[16785.16s -> 16810.82s]  paying the ass to get back in there i see exactly where it is though see right there i see it
[16811.54s -> 16832.63s]  okay bingo that's the other door so now let's finish this and there's a way to go through here
[16833.27s -> 16840.94s]  oh shit i need a bubble don't i so i got to take bubble from here all the way through
[16847.96s -> 16848.68s]  damn all right
[16864.76s -> 16865.56s]  oops oops
[16873.19s -> 16874.31s]  no stop it just
[16887.51s -> 16904.63s]  i got the super secret berry nice now we can get the hell out of here for god's
[16904.63s -> 16910.15s]  sakes the strawberries i just i mean i said berry didn't i i said berry i said berry right
[16911.43s -> 16931.90s]  berry a berry is a strawberry is a berry i'll be honest with you no idea no idea what that door is
[16932.54s -> 16934.90s]  how did i even get in here
[16944.76s -> 16957.43s]  oh this is new oh found the door excellent yes they know
[16960.07s -> 16971.37s]  they oh where are you hey uh why are you inside a mirror i'm pretty sure you're the one in the
[16971.37s -> 16978.81s]  mirror what happened well i was taking a nonchalant mirror selfie you know it's your boy
[16979.37s -> 16986.07s]  in this ancient temple no big deal hashtag i refuse to say it next thing i know i wake
[16986.07s -> 16992.87s]  up lying on the ground what does it look like over there how can i find you it's uh it's really
[16992.87s -> 16998.95s]  dark and weird there's wait something's coming i'm feeling a strong inclination to run away
[16998.95s -> 17014.50s]  be careful okay it's very dark in here here let's see if we can get in there yes we can
[17014.50s -> 17030.42s]  yeah secrets i think i see what looks like a secret entrance it is oh it's one of those
[17035.00s -> 17041.51s]  ah there are lanterns now that makes sense so i gotta go over here anything else
[17044.79s -> 17076.41s]  i get i did it okay yeah need more of those lanterns lit up i just stay hiding things from me
[17077.05s -> 17093.66s]  you know what i mean need to check every single wall that's it you either beat it or you die
[17094.54s -> 17125.35s]  let's light this room up though forget about progression light it up oops uh
[17132.46s -> 17147.51s]  can you pause yeah sure i'll pause you need to pee you have five seconds one okay that should
[17147.51s -> 17159.67s]  give you enough time can i get on the other side probably not just drag me over no no you
[17159.67s -> 17175.51s]  no don't drag me over i just went up it was too dark for me to realize that out there this place
[17175.51s -> 17195.38s]  is huge oh my goodness this place is gigantic all right what do you want me to do with this
[17197.59s -> 17230.15s]  oh yeah it's so big wrong balloon secrets no what see what's on the other side another one
[17230.15s -> 17237.48s]  that looks pretty to me it's not so we gotta go right then jump off the wall
[17239.54s -> 17272.26s]  or die either one oh that little space i saw it right the last second come on really oh give me
[17272.26s -> 17303.56s]  a break oh my fucking god i'm gonna i'm gonna return this controller i bought it four years ago
[17304.52s -> 17323.11s]  so definitely above the eye yeah oh yeah oh yeah i mean of course there is there's a key up there
[17328.01s -> 17347.16s]  nice a warranty so somehow there's a there's a bubble that goes all the way up if the controller
[17347.16s -> 17358.10s]  has a nice d-pad yeah the xbox d-pad i think is really bad though i mean let's be real it's okay
[17359.06s -> 17362.38s]  it's got a four-year warranty
[17374.33s -> 17387.98s]  here swish pro controller has a god tier d-pad yeah it does it really does
[17389.10s -> 17415.30s]  it's got separate buttons right for each d-pad how hurry let's try
[17425.06s -> 17439.30s]  oh i got a button shit i touched the candy crystals and i died oh
[17440.26s -> 17457.13s]  is there a secret that's probably a secret right there
[17468.44s -> 17482.70s]  that's it down here i can go back to this huge open area do have a key though is there a door over
[17482.70s -> 17496.84s]  here from the door but i'm not done though not i don't want to go there yet hold on
[17499.91s -> 17511.48s]  yeah that's okay that's where the door is there's so much more it's all the way to the right
[17512.36s -> 17532.84s]  giant eyeball monster all the way to the right but there's so much more to see look at this
[17532.84s -> 17539.11s]  look at all this bullshit and i don't i don't mean bullshit isn't bad i mean just stuff
[17557.40s -> 17560.52s]  no i thought i did this last time i jumped up fast

[17899.40s -> 17902.84s]  use the keyboard i can't do a platform with a keyboard i don't know how anyone humanly
[17902.84s -> 17913.22s]  possibly does that platform with keyboard is off it's no way how did i not do that come on
[17913.22s -> 17926.20s]  some of you guys like i said are fucking super humans why not because something about like
[17926.20s -> 17934.20s]  putting your my hand down on keys like this and having to use my index finger my ring finger
[17934.20s -> 17942.26s]  to move around or my um it just doesn't doesn't translate to me it's not like wasd
[17953.98s -> 17965.03s]  anything else i missed up here i don't think so now i'm of the opinion that a controller is
[17965.03s -> 17980.54s]  is better in at least a very specific few scenarios all right don't touch the ground
[17981.74s -> 18002.52s]  i have the i'll get this one first i think a lot of third-person games just feel better
[18003.56s -> 18022.74s]  platform must feel better with the controller for me another cassette currently unlocking
[18022.74s -> 18030.42s]  content for tomorrow let's see i i mean you're just gonna have to go at some point
[18032.90s -> 18035.62s]  right can i get the whole thing in one go i might be able to
[18050.58s -> 18054.58s]  oh my god i gotta get through that it's gotta be right when it switches
[18055.30s -> 18063.80s]  so it's gotta be one two uh here we go no i had it i don't know why i just freaked out
[18064.44s -> 18083.62s]  oh shit okay now what about this one looks like i could uh bounce off the sides here
[18085.70s -> 18097.69s]  okay roo and then hold on because i can't make that jump so i have to hold on to that
[18097.69s -> 18104.58s]  like this okay well you fucking xboxed me thanks a lot just got xboxed
[18105.30s -> 18107.94s]  ready

[18146.22s -> 18161.08s]  and now it's here down and then uh i get everything that i wanted to get i think so
[18165.27s -> 18191.82s]  i think it's time to leave i'm gonna go open the door now that's the gamer fatigue i got the
[18191.82s -> 18202.04s]  cassette the door wait what is this here to go back i'm just curious is there any reason to
[18202.04s -> 18226.71s]  go up or left or down or i don't think so here we go no reason to use the dash until now
[18237.40s -> 18249.14s]  i don't want to start this whole thing over again i'm gonna say down why no reason to go now
[18249.86s -> 18275.03s]  oh my god a couple different directions here well that's i just stretched i felt so far
[18280.36s -> 18298.07s]  i've got to take the i'm not gonna do that yet i'm gonna go right i guess that's the only way to go
[18298.71s -> 18299.27s]  no it's not
[18303.91s -> 18316.06s]  me to kick yes it is this is the game with the flying strawberries it is this is the game with
[18316.06s -> 18322.15s]  the flying strawberries you got it you nailed it completely i think we're just gonna go up
[18324.86s -> 18328.38s]  hold on a minute here though wait a second there's gonna be something on the side i know it
[18329.88s -> 18333.72s]  that you you wouldn't shoot that fast through the whole thing unless there's something to do here
[18334.76s -> 18353.27s]  i mean too late now this is gonna be a giant mirror i'm gonna assume that what a huge mirror
[18364.50s -> 18369.88s]  final boss i think we have at least four or five hours to go
[18382.60s -> 18388.22s]  it's gonna chase me the whole level isn't it i'm gonna have to fucking flappy bird through this
[18388.22s -> 18399.96s]  whole thing and oh it is me what am i supposed to do okay i can break and smash my head into stuff
[18399.96s -> 18411.14s]  and break stuff strawberries does the monster really even give a shit about strawberries i
[18411.14s -> 18419.26s]  would assume probably not there's no harm in checking what do these do can't go through them
[18426.31s -> 18433.94s]  why did chat slow down so much um i think it's starting to get a little later and people may
[18433.94s -> 18441.22s]  have left yeah there's probably people took off people had fun for a little while and then kind
[18441.22s -> 18454.87s]  of dwindled down a little just chilling out nothing else i feel like i'm gonna miss secrets
[18454.87s -> 18478.46s]  and i don't like making well did i just lose no now i am the monster i thought i could maybe
[18478.46s -> 18498.04s]  get up there the game forces you to go to the middle wait now it looks breakable let me go hey

[19173.45s -> 19188.22s]  i wonder if i can let me think about this for a second maybe i don't have to do that

[19486.33s -> 19491.61s]  what do you mean you didn't trap me in the crystal sure those monsters are coming from you but the
[19491.61s -> 19497.37s]  temple is shaping itself around me too i can feel it these eyes are staring at me and the
[19497.37s -> 19502.33s]  crystal is coming from me i know it i hate to ask but i really need your help right now
[19504.95s -> 19510.31s]  okay i've got your back i'll bust you out of that thing and then we'll escape together

[19556.63s -> 19563.90s]  it's possible i gotta go up from there more shit that we haven't seen yet

[19584.86s -> 19599.59s]  i'm kind of amazed out here um where was this door where's my map i need my map in the top right

[19642.01s -> 19668.68s]  the bubble here okay no stay alive what time what time is it yeah sometimes you get a bump
[19669.32s -> 19677.29s]  we should be fine okay i need another key for that door did i miss anything up here
[19683.96s -> 19693.13s]  jeez well yeah that'll probably happen a couple more times
[19694.65s -> 19698.89s]  shit i just gotta move out of the way don't even touch it
[19702.20s -> 19716.36s]  ah that guy's freaking me out losing internet again
[19722.30s -> 19729.82s]  well now that's what i'm paying attention to so in fact let me just pause it for a second to make
[19729.82s -> 19756.86s]  sure there's nothing actually going on no it's just being annoying no ah he's right there
[19757.99s -> 19759.83s]  oh my god he's gonna fuck this whole thing up
[19763.11s -> 19775.77s]  still has comcast i i do not have comcast i have a different company but i got some
[19777.03s -> 19788.39s]  news for everybody here they're all bad all the question is let me see hold on
[19800.06s -> 19818.92s]  although i don't really have any reason to be over here this is locked hit it oh it'll be like
[19818.92s -> 19835.83s]  something hidden there's a berry in here or something i'm killing me there's a thing to jump

[19905.06s -> 19911.48s]  really coming from inside me that's a valid question i'll be happy to discuss how the
[19911.48s -> 19915.08s]  monsters relate to your inner self but right now my inner self is real sick of being stuck in the
[19915.08s -> 19931.08s]  crystal oh right this crystal is like an expression of my negative psychic energy or whatever
[19932.52s -> 19939.14s]  yeah but how do we break it if i knew why i trapped myself in this thing maybe i could bust out
[19939.14s -> 19943.14s]  but i don't and i don't think i can get at the bottom of it while we're stuck in this nightmare
[19943.14s -> 19952.49s]  dimension you might have to carry me oh what no i would have been like carry me i don't wait that

[23376.38s -> 23385.34s]  but i don't leave it on webcam facecam to me all the time just feels like there's a security camera

[23391.30s -> 23395.14s]  somewhere you're out somewhere you're in a place where you know you are on fucking the security
[23395.14s -> 23400.98s]  camera and you just are like oh okay i'm just on that camera right now i guess it's like staring

[23784.09s -> 23789.38s]  bunch of games and do a shitty we stream i think i already did that didn't i didn't i i had you know
[23789.38s -> 23800.78s]  i did a lot of wee stuff a year or two ago but do i have any advice again for bullies um
[23805.03s -> 23811.58s]  i mean the thing the thing about getting picked on and bullies and shit honestly you kind of have to
[23811.58s -> 23822.65s]  like there there's a thing no don't bully him back no no no no i'm not sure what your friend
[23822.65s -> 23829.98s]  situation is but if you can make a few friends and you can kind of be around them and hang out
[23829.98s -> 23836.41s]  with them and it kind of makes it a lot harder for someone to kind of come up to you and be like
[23836.41s -> 23839.45s]  oh hey fuck you it's like well i got two buddies here like you fuck you actually
[23841.35s -> 23847.98s]  there's like strength in numbers and what a lot of times a bully will kind of pick out and so
[23847.98s -> 23865.45s]  single out somebody and it's really really unfortunate shit you have to learn to laugh
[23865.45s -> 23878.14s]  it off and invalidate them yeah but it's it's really hard to do that really it sits on hopefully
[23878.46s -> 23882.86s]  in the school system wherever you are you know people are looking out for that watching out
[23882.86s -> 23888.46s]  for that i feel like in the current year that we're in now the current generation
[23888.46s -> 23891.58s]  i feel like people are starting to really pay attention to it now or try to
[23905.45s -> 23912.30s]  just ignore them advice doesn't work no i don't know why people are just so fucking mean sometimes
[23912.30s -> 23924.58s]  it really i don't get it i wish i had a perfect answer i really do you know what even tries
[23924.58s -> 23942.38s]  everyone just tries to look like they care yeah in my experience confronting a bully always kind
[23942.38s -> 23945.90s]  of scares them off one way or another not saying physically but bullies bully people because they
[23945.90s -> 23955.05s]  think they are weak yeah there's a whole lot of complex things going on when it comes to
[23955.77s -> 23962.09s]  bullies trying to make their friends laugh trying to you know impress somebody trying to look
[23962.09s -> 23974.26s]  strong tough there's so much going on there it's just laughing it off can help if it's just
[23974.26s -> 23980.92s]  trash talking yeah but if it gets to a point where there's actual real you know physical
[23980.92s -> 23985.80s]  consequences then somebody somebody has to be told about it you know somebody you can't live
[23985.80s -> 24004.46s]  your life just getting fucking picked on and shit that's just not fun it's not cool wish
[24004.46s -> 24011.30s]  people just wouldn't be assholes but i guess that's too much to ask yeah there's a whole
[24012.26s -> 24016.70s]  like i just said there's a whole lot of complex shit going on as to how it even starts
[24017.34s -> 24023.99s]  so i wish i had the perfect answer but i don't i'm not necessarily qualified to have like a
[24023.99s -> 24036.26s]  perfect answer but i wish you luck hopefully you can find a way to make you know alleviate it or
[24037.62s -> 24057.67s]  you know get the school involved at that point let somebody know that that shit's going on but
[24057.67s -> 24065.02s]  thank you best of luck to you thank you door cube for the one dollar by the way if you ever get to
[24065.02s -> 24069.98s]  be get to a part of the game you just can't be especially in the b sides there's invincibility
[24069.98s -> 24076.06s]  and infinite dash cheats in the options menu they help less than expert players see all the game
[24076.06s -> 24083.74s]  has to offer they help less than expert players well i haven't done them yet i did the first b
[24083.74s -> 24098.26s]  sides without a problem we'll see hold on to that thought there because i haven't done it yet
[24098.82s -> 24108.47s]  but thank you ever scar for the three dollars here since you have a we and the other systems
[24108.47s -> 24115.86s]  what else to what a couple consoles do i own i don't have any of the consoles at the moment

[24230.84s -> 24234.76s]  because there really are a ton of games that you can't play anywhere else besides on a dreamcast
[24239.98s -> 24247.30s]  depends how much you value uh oddities that you've never seen before what if germa doesn't
