[5.05s -> 11.45s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight
[11.45s -> 15.53s]  I'm gonna be playing as the Soldier and a couple other things. It's just random clips of TF2 in the
[15.53s -> 21.05s]  background. Playing TF2 again. Yep, it's been a couple months, and then before that it was a
[21.05s -> 25.77s]  couple months, and then before that it was a couple months, but I got back into the game recently
[25.77s -> 29.85s]  because of this most recent update, the Gunmetal update, and that's what we're going to talk about
[29.85s -> 34.15s]  in this video. We're also going to talk about some other stuff too in the end, so this might be a
[34.15s -> 38.87s]  little bit longer of a commentary than I typically do, but let's talk about Gunmetal. It just came
[38.87s -> 43.02s]  out, brand new update yesterday. I think it's really awesome. There's a lot of great things
[43.02s -> 48.30s]  about it. I do have like one or two little reserves. Well, not reserves, but there are
[48.30s -> 52.84s]  just some things I wish they did differently. First of all, four new maps. That is something
[52.84s -> 59.69s]  we are not used to, especially one map that Valve made that's not in a beta. Why is this map not in
[59.69s -> 65.77s]  beta? And why are the other two maps still in beta? You know what I mean? Like the Cactus Canyon
[65.77s -> 71.00s]  still in beta. Who made this? Something's going on there. I don't know. I'm not going to pretend
[71.00s -> 76.12s]  to know the inside and outside of it, but it's a finished done Valve made map. It's called Power
[76.12s -> 80.44s]  House, and it's three control points. The first time they've ever really done that, so that's pretty
[80.44s -> 86.52s]  cool, and also there's a new map for each popular game mode, right? You've got a new King of the
[86.52s -> 92.28s]  Hill map, a new payload map, and a new control point map. Snowplow? They came up with Snowplow
[92.28s -> 98.12s]  too, out of left field. They just decided to release this? That's so odd. Like I thought they
[98.12s -> 103.08s]  didn't want to put Snowplow in this game. There's a lot of questions. There's a lot of questions
[103.08s -> 109.08s]  to ask about this update and why they did certain things, because if Snowplow is now an official
[109.08s -> 114.28s]  supported Valve map, why didn't they just make end of the line the Smithsmas update? Why didn't they
[114.28s -> 118.44s]  make those two coincide? If they were just going to put it in the game anyways, they probably could
[118.44s -> 123.32s]  have saved a lot of face by doing that, and I don't know what the reasoning behind putting it in the
[123.32s -> 129.32s]  game now is. It just seems like, oh, by the way, I guess it's not so complicated after all. You can
[129.32s -> 136.04s]  play it. Okay. Thanks. Whatever, though. It's in the game now, and it's fun. Snowplow is fun.
[136.04s -> 141.40s]  It might be different. It might be totally weird, but it's fun. It's a gigantic map. It's a huge open
[141.40s -> 145.08s]  playing field. Whatever. You might hate it. You might love it. It's in the game now, and it's
[145.08s -> 149.08s]  official. So there we go. We can move on from the maps. We can talk about the items. Well, not the
[149.08s -> 155.98s]  items per se, the item skins and how I feel about the contracts. I really like the contracts. The
[155.98s -> 159.98s]  contracts are probably the coolest part of this entire update. Really. I love the contracts. One
[159.98s -> 165.54s]  problem, though, after you do your two contracts, there's not a whole lot left to do for the update
[165.54s -> 172.10s]  because we only get two contracts a week, and each one of these contracts takes like 25 minutes
[172.10s -> 176.42s]  to do each one. So you end up doing all your contracts. Oh, I can't wait. Gonna play Spy.
[176.42s -> 183.29s]  Contract. Let's let it take. I just did it. It's over. I got my item. Okay. See you in seven days.
[183.29s -> 190.41s]  Now you contrast that to when Man vs. Machine came out. Imagine if Valve only let us do one tour a
[190.41s -> 195.35s]  week. I would have lost my fucking mind because when Man vs. Machine first came out, that's like
[195.35s -> 200.79s]  all I wanted to do. I just wanted to do tour after tour after tour. Good. Valve, take my fucking money.
[200.79s -> 204.31s]  Take my one dollar ticket. I don't give a shit. I want to play. I want to do the update. I want
[204.31s -> 210.09s]  to get involved and I want to do it. You can't really do that in this update. You spend six bucks
[210.09s -> 215.22s]  and it's just dragged out over the next three months, which that's cool. But in my personal
[215.22s -> 220.97s]  opinion, if you're going to have two contracts a week, those contracts should probably take a
[220.97s -> 225.78s]  little bit more time to complete. And even if they don't want you to keep getting items, maybe they
[225.78s -> 230.74s]  want to limit the amount of items people can get, then at least let us still be able to do contracts
[230.74s -> 236.42s]  and level up that coin after we get our first two items. I don't know. We'll see. This is very early.
[236.42s -> 240.90s]  It's a pretty interesting concept. I just really want to see more of it. That's I was starving to
[240.90s -> 247.45s]  do more, not less. And we're going to move on. They did a bunch of balance changes in this update,
[247.45s -> 251.29s]  a ton of them, and they're getting ready for competitive. It's pretty obvious based around
[251.29s -> 255.13s]  some of the changes they have. And there are a bunch, there are a million changes. So I really
[255.13s -> 258.41s]  don't want to go over them all because that would take another like 15 straight minutes for me to
[258.41s -> 264.01s]  talk about it. But I will bring up two things in particular. One, the big earner change. There are
[264.01s -> 268.17s]  now spy scouts that are going to be all over the place. I don't even want to know what some of you
[268.17s -> 273.29s]  comp level guys that play spy are going to do with that item now. And the other thing is what they
[273.29s -> 279.69s]  did to heavy. They made the Natasha and the brass beast have a 20% damage mitigation while you have
[279.69s -> 286.01s]  the gun spun down. So you can no longer insta kill headshot a heavy that's overhealed anymore. You
[286.09s -> 290.25s]  can't, you're gonna have to shoot the dude twice. That's a huge deal that change that I used to
[290.25s -> 295.69s]  hate playing heavy, because you turn the corner and be a fucking sandbag and insta die. Now,
[295.69s -> 299.93s]  as long as you have the overheal, you can at least react when you get that crit in the face,
[299.93s -> 302.89s]  you can try to move or get into cover or something. You're not just going to be
[303.45s -> 307.82s]  target practice for every sniper on the other team. But besides those two things,
[308.46s -> 313.02s]  I mean, everything else is really awesome and cool. I just it's so overwhelming when they do
[313.02s -> 318.79s]  valve likes to do this thing, right? Where instead of giving one or two balance changes every couple
[318.79s -> 323.11s]  weeks or something like that, or every week, they do like a tweak, they give us this giant
[323.11s -> 330.23s]  dump list of fucking like 500 changes. And it's like, all right, here you go. Here's every change
[330.23s -> 335.27s]  we've wanted to make to Team Fortress two over the last like three years. Okay, guys, take it and go
[335.27s -> 339.99s]  tell us what you think. It's a little overwhelming sometimes. So I'm doing it. I'm taking it as much
[339.99s -> 344.15s]  as everybody else is. And I'm trying to get as much information as I can to myself. So when
[344.15s -> 349.43s]  competitive rolls around, maybe I'll start playing competitive matchmaking. Of course I will. I've
[349.43s -> 354.70s]  been looking for reasons to get back into this game. And with competitive looming, and the recent
[354.70s -> 360.70s]  contract stuff, I have reasons to play. That's been the big deal for me in Team Fortress two.
[360.70s -> 365.56s]  I haven't had reasons to want to play. I don't know how they're going to flesh out. We'll just
[365.56s -> 370.20s]  have to wait and see. But that's going to wrap up the update portion of the video and my thoughts
[370.20s -> 375.80s]  and all that jazz. Now we're going to talk about a life update. So the next like two or three minutes
[375.80s -> 380.97s]  is going to be me talking about a life update. How exciting. So what's this big life update?
[380.97s -> 384.65s]  What's happening here? What do you mean? Oh, there's a life update. Would you stub your toe again?
[384.65s -> 390.47s]  No, I bought a place and I'm moving. In the last couple of months, at least the last like two or
[390.47s -> 396.23s]  three months has been extremely hectic. Trying to juggle everything that's going on, getting
[396.23s -> 402.31s]  financing for this place, finding it in the first place, and moving everything in because it's empty.
[402.31s -> 407.27s]  And it's been taking a wreck on my brain. It hasn't been all that smooth of an experience,
[407.27s -> 413.19s]  but it really never is, is it? Anytime you move out of a place, you buy something new. It's just
[413.19s -> 417.19s]  all the shit you have in your old house, all the stuff you have to bring to the new one. Are you
[417.19s -> 420.79s]  going to get new furniture? Are you going to buy a new fridge? Are you tearing up a couple floors?
[420.87s -> 428.41s]  Are you painting walls? Is the place on fire right now? Is the place on fire right now? I don't know.
[428.41s -> 434.65s]  I'm not there. There is no discernible way for me to say or not say the place is or is not on fire
[434.65s -> 440.87s]  right now. These are the things that go through my head when I'm sitting here, not at the place
[440.87s -> 445.27s]  because I obviously haven't moved in yet, but you just stress out over random shit that you don't
[445.27s -> 449.43s]  need to stress out over. You just got to take it slow. Everybody I've talked to said anytime
[449.43s -> 455.43s]  you buy a place, do one thing at a time. You don't got to go bring a cot in and live there
[455.43s -> 462.50s]  immediately. You just get things situated, get ready, and then live, baby. Live. And we transition
[462.50s -> 469.86s]  talking about how I'm moving into the fact that now I want to stream pretty much every single day.
[469.86s -> 476.60s]  Once I actually get all moved in somewhere in the middle of August, I want to stream at least four
[476.60s -> 481.42s]  or five times a week. This is something that I've wanted to do for a long time, but I've never been
[481.42s -> 486.70s]  able to get my ducks in a row in my brain and my body in the right position to be able to do this
[486.70s -> 491.98s]  thing. I love the idea of streaming. I love just hanging out and playing games with whoever shows
[491.98s -> 495.90s]  up, whatever game I happen to be playing. It's something that I really want to do, and I'm going
[495.90s -> 502.78s]  to try it at my fullest ability the second that I moved into this place and everything's ready to go.
[502.78s -> 508.65s]  So this is like update video and hey I'm moving and stream announcement video all in one. So
[508.65s -> 513.05s]  that's going to wrap it up. Take care everybody. See you all soon. Enjoy the new Team Fortress 2
[513.05s -> 516.41s]  update. It's going to be so much fun. I can't wait. Now here this is this is the part of the video
[516.41s -> 517.45s]  where it goes BOO!
