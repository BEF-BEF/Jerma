[3.45s -> 14.57s]  What is going on everybody? Jerma here again. This time I am gonna be doing a
[14.57s -> 19.45s]  duel commentary. It's somebody very special in my life. Gonna be doing a
[19.45s -> 24.01s]  duel com with my grandfather. Yes he is. So grandpa, if you'd like to introduce
[24.01s -> 28.53s]  yourself right now is a pretty good time. Okay. Go ahead. Hi, I'm Jerma's
[28.53s -> 33.85s]  grandfather. This is Milford Dougal. He is my grandpa of 87 years. That's right. He's
[33.85s -> 38.39s]  been here a long time and he loves to game which is ridiculous. I love it. It's
[38.39s -> 41.99s]  my favorite thing. It's my... video games are the best thing in the world, especially
[41.99s -> 48.03s]  Super Mario 3. Naturally, yeah. Yes, that's the best game I've ever played, probably
[48.03s -> 54.49s]  in my life. And today I'm gonna play some... Steve, Team Fortress... what are we
[54.49s -> 58.39s]  playing today? We are playing Team Fortress 2, grandpa. This is the game I was
[58.39s -> 61.19s]  telling you about. The one I'm doing online and stuff like that, you know, I
[61.19s -> 64.59s]  was telling you about it earlier. Yep, I remember. So anyways, you're gonna be
[64.59s -> 69.67s]  playing what? What? As what class? I mean, sorry. I'm playing as the
[69.67s -> 73.91s]  soldier with the rocket launcher. It's a fucking huge... I told you you couldn't swear. Oh shit.
[73.91s -> 77.91s]  Okay. It's okay. You can't swear. I'm sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean to talk like
[77.91s -> 84.15s]  that. I'm not a sailor. It's alright. I'm not a sailor by any means. Let me get into the game here.
[84.15s -> 90.47s]  What is this? You gotta click on join. Yeah, okay. He's got it. Give him a second.
[90.47s -> 95.43s]  He's got it. It might take me a second or two, but once I figure it out... I almost
[95.43s -> 98.95s]  swore right there again for like the fourth time. Almost. But it takes me a
[98.95s -> 104.83s]  second. But once I get in the zone, I really start to kill people. And if you
[104.83s -> 109.71s]  saw my last video, I used to do videos for Insane Aquarium on my old
[109.71s -> 115.83s]  channel. The channel was youtube.com slash grandpa dickhead, but I can't use
[115.83s -> 119.69s]  that name anymore because I'm not allowed to use that name. I told you easy. But now
[120.17s -> 124.73s]  I'm on Jerma's channel for good now. I'm gonna do commentaries with him every
[124.73s -> 130.77s]  single day. So hopefully... I don't know about that. Maybe soon. Well, when we can, when we can
[130.77s -> 134.97s]  do commentaries together, I'll make sure to bring my A game. Well good. Hopefully
[134.97s -> 137.89s]  you brought your A game today because you're gonna need it. Because this game's
[137.89s -> 141.49s]  not that easy when you first start out. You've seen me play before. You
[141.49s -> 145.85s]  know what I'm talking about. You're talking to somebody that beat Donkey Kong
[145.85s -> 151.53s]  in five minutes, okay? Don't even try and tell me that I'm some kind of noob at this game.
[151.53s -> 155.41s]  You're noob. I bet you I can beat you in a duel, one on one. I know what duels are. I
[155.41s -> 158.77s]  looked up. I did my research. You did. You were on the computer for like three hours.
[158.77s -> 164.09s]  Come out of the spawn here. And this guy... What is this guy doing? That's a heavy.
[164.09s -> 167.85s]  I want to be that guy. I'm gonna be that guy, right? I changed my mind. I want to be
[167.85s -> 172.05s]  this guy. Okay, well go in the spawn and there you go. Okay, this guy looks like
[172.21s -> 176.73s]  he's the biggest guy on the game, the game. So I'm gonna play with him. He's
[176.73s -> 180.77s]  slow though. He's pretty slow. So tell me what should I play? How do I play this
[180.77s -> 184.49s]  guy? Should I be like a superhero and just jump at people and attack them? Yeah,
[184.49s -> 193.29s]  that's the heavy. I'm gonna go this way. No, don't. Listen. This is a tactical way. I'm telling you. This is the way you go if you want to be tactical.
[193.29s -> 198.33s]  Listen, grandpa. If you go that, that's the wrong way. You have to turn around. If you
[198.33s -> 201.25s]  stand still any longer, you're gonna get back to that by spy. I'm just telling you.
[201.45s -> 206.49s]  What the fuck is a spy? There's a spy. Okay, I have to explain to you the game
[206.49s -> 210.45s]  before you do anything stupid. Well, do it. You're playing under my name right now. I
[210.45s -> 213.89s]  don't want you to... I don't want people to think that this is some idiot like
[213.89s -> 217.45s]  who took over Jerma's account or something. Listen. If you listen to me,
[217.45s -> 220.73s]  you'll be fine. Oh, listen. Tell me what you want me to tell me, you know. I'm
[220.73s -> 224.81s]  sitting here. Okay, all right. So this is Dust Bowl. Okay. This is probably like the
[224.81s -> 228.81s]  easiest map to learn because there's only like one way people can go. Turn
[228.81s -> 232.77s]  around, walk straight, and you got to follow your teammates. Just follow where
[232.77s -> 236.49s]  they're going. This guy. You'll get to the enemy team. You're on red. Okay, don't
[236.49s -> 241.13s]  shoot him. Don't shoot at people on red. You're on red. I'm gonna shoot this guy. So get out
[241.13s -> 246.41s]  here. There you go. All right, fine. And then just, yeah. Okay, yeah. Oh, it's the blue team.
[246.41s -> 255.18s]  Oh my god. Oh, get old, you motherfucker. You're dead. You are dead, you shithead. I
[255.38s -> 262.52s]  No, no, no, no, no. Don't go up the stairs. I'll go up these stairs if I want to. I'm gonna punch this
[262.52s -> 268.40s]  fucking guy. All right, stop swearing, please. You're gonna get me in trouble. I'm sorry. I can't
[268.40s -> 273.68s]  help it. I grew up in LA. All right, well, just come down the stairs. There you go.
[273.68s -> 278.60s]  Who's that guy? Get that guy. Get him. I'm trying to shoot him. He's running away. Get him.
[278.60s -> 284.48s]  Yeah. He's dead. I did that. You didn't do it. Okay. So should I walk to this, well,
[284.72s -> 289.80s]  platformer. Take out your sandwich and eat it. If you go hit two. I'm gonna die. Two is your
[289.80s -> 294.16s]  secondary and that's, okay. Right now it's, there's a bunch of different items, but I'm not even
[294.16s -> 298.84s]  gonna pretend I'm, like, I can explain that to you. So just hit two and then eat the sandwich. What's the best
[298.84s -> 303.64s]  item in the game? Yeah, make sure you're in a spot that's, like, safe, though. Don't just stand still. Yeah,
[303.64s -> 309.28s]  but what's the best item in the game? I kind of want to know, because maybe I want it. All right,
[309.28s -> 315.44s]  fine. I'll eat it. As you guys can tell, it's really hard to play with him. Oh, yeah. Yeah,
[315.44s -> 320.52s]  okay. Says you, the hardest person to play with. No, it's hard to play with you. Any game. No,
[320.52s -> 325.88s]  it's not. I mean, it's easy. Especially a game like this, like, especially. Well, no matter why
[325.88s -> 331.00s]  am I playing then, maybe I should just quit and go back to writing my book. No. The title is not
[331.00s -> 336.68s]  written yet, so don't even ask. Okay. But I, oh, watch out for this guy right here. He looks like
[336.68s -> 340.60s]  he's pretty mad. You're good. You're good. You're good. So what's the best, I want to talk about what
[340.60s -> 345.16s]  the best item in the entire game is. What is it? Well, what do you think the best item in the game
[345.32s -> 351.72s]  is? There is none, to be honest. I think it's the Razorback. That thing looks really cool. No. All
[351.72s -> 356.28s]  right. Well, you couldn't be any more wrong. I don't think so. It really does. All the items are
[356.28s -> 361.90s]  good. I mean, I say the Razorback is not, but no, whatever. If you like the item, use it. It's all
[361.90s -> 364.78s]  about preference. You say a lot of dumb things. Well, I don't even have to, you're not going to
[364.78s -> 369.26s]  play this game ever again. So it doesn't, I don't have to tell you any of this. So just keep playing
[369.26s -> 372.62s]  and just, I don't have to explain this to you because you're going to forget in like five
[372.62s -> 379.10s]  minutes. I am not going to forget this in five minutes. I already forgot what you told me five
[379.10s -> 381.98s]  minutes ago, but it doesn't mean I'm going to forget what you just said five minutes from now.
[381.98s -> 385.98s]  What do you think this is? Some kind of game, even though we are playing a game. I'm telling
[385.98s -> 392.94s]  you right now, I won't forget any of this. I'm going to come on Team Fortress tomorrow and I'm
[392.94s -> 398.14s]  going to play and I'm going to be the best damn sorcerer anyone's ever seen. And if you don't
[398.22s -> 404.44s]  think that's true, then you can, you can stuff it brother. Oh, all right. That's fine. Yeah.
[404.44s -> 408.04s]  Just, you know, you can play on your own now. I'll let you play on your own since you don't
[408.04s -> 411.96s]  need my help and you don't think anything I say is worthwhile anyways. So I don't need your help.
[411.96s -> 416.36s]  I'm going to leave and hopefully you can figure it out on your own because I'm not going to sit
[416.36s -> 419.80s]  here and baby you anymore. Cause obviously you don't need that, right? You're a baby, not me.
[419.80s -> 424.76s]  So anyways, uh, take care guys. I'll see you at the live stream Saturday. Big birthday party.
[424.76s -> 427.48s]  Hell yeah. Let's do it. I'm going to be there. No, you're not going to be there.
[427.72s -> 431.90s]  What? No, why would you be there? Because it's you're going to be at grandma's anyways. You're
[431.90s -> 438.46s]  going to be at, at, at Jones. Oh, okay. Yeah. So, but dinner sucks over there. You're doing family
[438.46s -> 443.50s]  dinner there. Yeah, but dinner sucks over there. I want to eat with you tomorrow. I don't want to
[443.50s -> 448.78s]  be over there. That place sucks. Well, I mean, if, if you want to come to the live stream for like
[448.78s -> 453.34s]  a few minutes or something, okay, by all means you can come, but you can't hang out all night.
[453.34s -> 458.07s]  Cause why, why the hell not? You just can't be over. You can't hang out all night. That's it.
[458.07s -> 463.91s]  All right. Fine. So bye guys. I'll see you all tomorrow at the live stream. Peace. Okay. See
[463.91s -> 469.93s]  you later. And, um, I'll see you later. Yeah. Hey, just make check. Wait, how do I make a pitch?
[470.97s -> 474.33s]  Shut the computer down when you're done. Cause I'm not going to come back in here. What?
[475.45s -> 480.57s]  Shut the computer down when you're done. Oh, okay. I'll shut the computer off. All right.
[480.57s -> 488.60s]  See you later. I love you son or grandson. Oh God, I'm going to puke. So anyways,

[496.04s -> 502.63s]  going to be the title or not, but it should be. Okay. Salute United States of America.
