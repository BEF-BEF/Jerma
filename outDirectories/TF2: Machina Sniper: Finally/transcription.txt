[0.82s -> 7.82s]  Yo, what's happening guys? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary!
[7.82s -> 11.00s]  Playing as the sniper tonight with the Machina.
[11.00s -> 16.00s]  Never done a Machina gameplay, a lot of you guys asked me for this, and I finally have done it.
[16.00s -> 21.00s]  So it's the Machina, the Darwin's Danger Shield, and the Tribalman's Shiv, I believe.
[21.00s -> 29.00s]  I die once or twice in the beginning here, and after that, I just start mowing people down like crazy, headshot after headshot, it's pretty awesome.
[29.00s -> 34.24s]  So why I never use the Machina and why I've never done a Machina gameplay?
[34.24s -> 38.24s]  Everybody always tells me, Jerma, the Machina is the best sniper rifle in the game.
[38.24s -> 42.42s]  Hands down, why wouldn't you use it? Just equip it for crying out loud.
[42.42s -> 48.42s]  And the reason why I never use it, guys, is because I can't handle the line that comes out of the gun.
[48.42s -> 53.78s]  That might sound weird, but it has nothing to do with giving away my position.
[53.78s -> 58.02s]  What bothers me about it is the fact that I can't really see that well.
[58.02s -> 70.20s]  It sort of messes with my aim, because I'll shoot somebody, and if I miss, this big bright line comes right in my face, and my ADHD kicks in, and I just focus on that, and then I get shot, I just can't recuperate.
[70.20s -> 74.20s]  So I can't use this gun mainly because of that line.
[74.20s -> 78.20s]  The second reason why I can't use this weapon is the no hip fire.
[78.20s -> 87.44s]  I can't take it, because I'm one of those people that if a spy is around, I'm much more satisfied and much safer shooting him from the hip rather than going in and getting face stabbed.
[87.44s -> 91.62s]  So not being able to hip fire really, really sucks.
[91.62s -> 97.79s]  And I know a lot of you guys are going to tell me, well, Jerma, equip the machine gun, the SMG, that's the perfect combination.
[97.79s -> 101.03s]  It's just the SMG has such weird hit detection.
[101.03s -> 107.03s]  It seems like when you use the SMG and you shoot somebody, half the time the bullets don't even register landing on the person.
[107.03s -> 112.03s]  It's just really odd. I don't like the hit detection on that weapon, so I don't like to use it.
[112.03s -> 117.40s]  But all in all, this gun is very, very good for killing people who are over-healed.
[117.40s -> 121.88s]  This is the over-healer killer. Kind of a mouthful, I know.
[121.88s -> 127.06s]  You can kill people that are over-healed with a body shot with this gun.
[127.06s -> 138.06s]  Any of the smaller classes, a scout, a sniper, spy, even a medic, you can still body shot them and potentially kill them with a fully charged body shot, which that was not the case with the older sniper rifle.
[138.06s -> 145.36s]  So one of the only tips I can really give you with this gun, because honestly I don't really use it that often, is you have to be patient.
[145.36s -> 151.36s]  This is the patient man's sniper rifle. You can't just go shooting like a Texas Longhorn.
[151.36s -> 154.36s]  I don't even know what that is. But you can't just shoot all over the place.
[154.36s -> 159.36s]  You need to really time your shots, because guys, you're giving away your position every time you shoot the gun.
[159.36s -> 166.36s]  And to touch upon that for a second, if you stay in the same position for long enough, you are going to get found out.
[166.36s -> 169.36s]  People are going to start to shoot at you. People are going to start coming after you.
[170.36s -> 175.36s]  So move around a lot, guys. Don't stand in the same position for more than 20 or 30 seconds.
[175.36s -> 181.36s]  And I know I don't do that at all in this gameplay. I'm standing in the same spot, but that's because this is on Gold Rush.
[181.36s -> 187.36s]  And Gold Rush really only has like two or three places a sniper can even stand in the first place.
[187.36s -> 192.36s]  But on a big map like Upward or Badwater or something like that, you really need to move around.
[192.36s -> 195.36s]  So there you go. There's my rant on the Makina.
[195.36s -> 200.36s]  I'm going to talk about the gameplay, what's going on on the screen now, while there's still time.
[200.36s -> 205.73s]  So I just walk out the back door here, go pick up this health. I love this health pack.
[205.73s -> 211.73s]  This is the best health pack in the game. Just because it's a full health pack, it's right there, right around that choke point.
[211.73s -> 215.90s]  I love it so much. Coming back to this window here, bad idea.
[215.90s -> 221.90s]  Almost get myself killed for a second time. And you would think I learned my lesson right here, but I do not.
[221.90s -> 227.90s]  Get some health, come back over to that same window. I want to get that Demoman, whether it kills me or not.
[227.90s -> 232.08s]  I don't care. I want to get him. There he is right there. I don't get the shot on him.
[232.08s -> 238.08s]  He's too well protected by that wall. Sniper just dies. I don't know whether he had a heart attack, I think.
[238.08s -> 242.08s]  So look at this. Nobody's coming out. The heavy medic pair is up there doing work.
[242.08s -> 245.08s]  There they are. I figured time to get out of this window.
[245.08s -> 249.26s]  Jumping down, I get right next to the car because nobody's on it right now.
[249.26s -> 252.26s]  This is a great opportunity to push the cart and nobody's on it.
[252.26s -> 258.43s]  The plan is to stand next to the cart while you're zoomed in so you still get the cap points.
[258.43s -> 264.43s]  Gets a little too dangerous to continue to do that, so I sit back here, try to get some spawn trap headshots.
[264.43s -> 270.43s]  I think I get maybe one or two and I end up going around the left side because action kind of dies down right here.
[270.43s -> 273.43s]  Don't see anybody really coming out. I'm missing a lot of shots.
[273.43s -> 278.43s]  So I take a left-handed turn over here, go around the left side, try to flank him a little bit.
[278.43s -> 281.67s]  Ends up working out much, much better than this is right now.
[281.67s -> 286.67s]  I take the turn in about five seconds here, go around the left side. I get a bunch of headshots after this.
[286.67s -> 290.67s]  I get one shot in particular that I just couldn't believe I got it.
[290.67s -> 293.67s]  I was like, wow, how the hell did I get that?
[293.67s -> 298.67s]  It's an engineer coming up right here. Get this soldier. I believe I get this pyro as well. There he is.
[298.67s -> 302.67s]  So it's an engineer that I end up getting. I missed this scout right here, but watch this.
[302.67s -> 307.67s]  When I get this engineer, I like perfectly track his head, almost like I'm hacking or something,
[307.67s -> 311.67s]  but I promise you I'm not hacking. I end up just getting it somehow.
[311.67s -> 316.91s]  There it is right there, perfectly tracked headshot on an engineer jumping around a corner.
[316.91s -> 320.91s]  Germa hack version 1.6. That is going to be the end of the gameplay.
[320.91s -> 323.91s]  I get this last heavy. He's kind of just standing here.
[323.91s -> 327.91s]  I missed the headshot right there, but I get him twice, one and two right there.
[327.91s -> 330.91s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[330.91s -> 333.91s]  I top frag in this gameplay, which is always fun, always cool.
[333.91s -> 338.91s]  So if you like this video, go ahead and throw me a like, and I will see you guys all next time.
[338.91s -> 340.91s]  Take care, everybody.
