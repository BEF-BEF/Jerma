[0.95s -> 16.89s]  Yeah, I know I said I'd be here at around noon, but I'm here now. I'm here. It's possible that Jeremy's gonna quit streaming one day.
[16.89s -> 28.46s]  What do you mean possible? It's absolute. You know, it's very possible that one day Jeremy's not gonna stream anymore.
[28.46s -> 35.22s]  What do you mean by- that's absolutely going to happen one day. I can't- I don't- I can't live forever.
[35.22s -> 52.45s]  Or possible that one day he won't stream again.
[52.45s -> 63.47s]  Possible. We found all the Horcruxes. Yeah, okay. You think so.
[63.47s -> 68.47s]  You see, that- that- that- Voldemort, what a dummy.
[68.47s -> 75.85s]  Why would you make it all those fucking objects? Why would you make it stuff like that?
[75.85s -> 82.48s]  You- you made it the most, like, popular things, you know? Why would you do that?
[82.48s -> 94.59s]  No. If I had ten Horcruxes, five of them are gonna be surgically attached to my body.
[94.59s -> 100.02s]  Oh, no, one of them. Not five of them, because then if you, like, fucking shoot at it and stuff, then it's gone.
[100.02s -> 117.21s]  I'm sewing one of my Horcruxes into my bed. Why would you just put it in a vault? No, it's gotta be with you, around you at all times.
[117.21s -> 122.79s]  Why would you keep them on you? That defeats the purpose. No, because then you gotta come through me.
[122.79s -> 125.79s]  I want one on me. I want one to be my baseball hat.
[125.79s -> 134.06s]  You know what a great Horcrux would be, guys? Shit that you wouldn't even give a shit about.
[134.06s -> 139.93s]  Why wouldn't he have made one of his Horcruxes his showerhead? Who the fuck is going to do that?
[139.93s -> 145.17s]  Who would ever go into Voldemort's shower and say, this is definitely one of them? No.
[145.17s -> 161.75s]  The handle, the little flapper of your toilet. I'm not gonna make it some elaborate, mystical device or being, no.
[161.75s -> 176.13s]  It's gonna be an old book that I didn't care about reading. Or a toilet seat. Or one mug.
[176.13s -> 186.98s]  Anyways, hi. What was the joke? Oh yeah, people are just kinda coming in and just catching it halfway.
[186.98s -> 190.98s]  Just go watch the beginning of the stream. It's only been like three minutes, so you can catch up.
[190.98s -> 201.03s]  What if it accidentally gets destroyed?
[201.03s -> 215.30s]  Um, I don't think I'm gonna be taking a shower and cast the Iviticus spell into the wall near the showerhead.
[215.30s -> 224.87s]  Magical spells would be banned in my bathroom. It just wouldn't be allowed.
[224.87s -> 227.87s]  Like, now fuck that. You wouldn't be allowed to cast spells in my house.
[227.87s -> 230.87s]  You know how people have the rule of take your shoes off before you enter the house?
[230.87s -> 237.42s]  Put your wand of no spells in this house. None.
[237.42s -> 241.42s]  We're gonna do the Olympics today. 2012 London Olympics.
[241.42s -> 249.24s]  Not Mario and Sonic at the London Olympic Games. No, we're just doing...
[249.24s -> 253.24s]  This apparently is the one that has the most of games to play.
[253.24s -> 257.38s]  I think it has 35 events.
[257.38s -> 266.72s]  I also have the Beijing one. 2008. For some reason. I don't know why. I own it.
[266.72s -> 276.04s]  It was not that expensive. Don't worry. This sucks. Just go play God Hand.
[276.04s -> 280.34s]  I mean, that's an option if I don't like it. I don't think that's gonna be possible, though.
[280.34s -> 288.03s]  I saw a little bit of the preview of what this... I'm gonna try to get gold medals. Silver medals, at least.
[288.03s -> 297.90s]  You ready? I am. Here it is.
[297.90s -> 304.76s]  I've had to hear this in my ears since the stream started, by the way.
[304.76s -> 309.13s]  Six straight, seven straight minutes. This doesn't change.
[309.13s -> 318.40s]  All right. Olympic Games. Take on the world at the London 2012 Olympic Games.
[318.40s -> 330.43s]  This is almost ten years ago, yes. I'm gonna... I'm doing it. I'm gonna try to win as many as I can.
[330.43s -> 335.74s]  How do streamers even read chat? We have s... s... We don't. We don't.
[335.74s -> 339.74s]  We don't. We just pick out one thing that somebody said every ten minutes.
[339.74s -> 344.32s]  And hope that it's fucking relevant to the conversation.
[344.32s -> 348.32s]  I'm just kidding. Face Camo Riot. See? No, I can read that one.
[348.32s -> 356.86s]  Select how challenging the CPU will be. Well, we can't even do hard, so don't even tell me to select it. I can't do it.
[356.86s -> 367.22s]  Play tw... Well, hold on. Play 12 events. Play 20 events.
[367.22s -> 373.30s]  Is this like Mario Party? Am I only selecting just the amount of turns we're gonna have?
[373.30s -> 377.66s]  How funny would that be if this just opened up on a game board with the dice and shit?
[377.66s -> 381.90s]  What? No no no no no no no no no! Don't... Oh, a six.
[381.90s -> 386.87s]  That'd actually be awesome. I kind of wish it was like that.
[386.87s -> 395.93s]  That was kind of funny I guess. I was... that was just what it sounds like when you play Mario Party with the dice.
[395.93s -> 397.93s]  Like, that's just... I mean that was a fact. Not a joke.
[397.93s -> 399.93s]  All right. Who am I playing as?
[400.23s -> 403.28s]  Okay, we have
[403.28s -> 407.19s]  Australia
[407.19s -> 411.71s]  Hmm. I have to be the United States right like I'm from the United States. Is this locked?
[412.39s -> 414.30s]  What?
[414.30s -> 427.95s]  Why is the United States locked? What's no, it's definitely not locked. Oh shit. Okay. I am
[427.95s -> 429.95s]  American
[440.79s -> 443.15s]  Somebody made this joke, but I'm gonna make it too. I
[444.35s -> 448.79s]  Had a plan to make this as well. I hope it's like an hour and 40 minute long cut
[457.95s -> 461.83s]  Splendid glowing like a beacon here in London's East End
[469.47s -> 475.95s]  So many nations represented here already to compete alright, so do I have to be part of the opening ceremony

[1647.73s -> 1652.40s]  How many times do I have to do this?
[1652.56s -> 1654.86s]  I'm just embarrassing myself

[1797.41s -> 1799.65s]  It's so pressure sensitive and so fucked up
[1801.01s -> 1803.01s]  All right, let's do it. I'm ready
[1804.11s -> 1806.11s]  Pop four doping dan get in there
[1807.65s -> 1809.65s]  When do I go just comes down to perform?
[1810.45s -> 1821.44s]  Hold on
[1826.08s -> 1828.08s]  Come on drugs you motherfuckers
[1828.96s -> 1832.40s]  You'll never beat me. I'm gonna catch up to this little brick
[1845.60s -> 1847.60s]  Second place third place
[1859.57s -> 1865.59s]  When it came down to the finish on the line good strength to go through the tape another good performance
[1865.59s -> 1868.47s]  Oh
[1888.20s -> 1898.72s]  Okay, this is it this is the real one this is for the olympic gold medal
[1909.67s -> 1922.47s]  I gotta get a gold with doping dan. Come on. He's psyched up for this. Here we go
[1923.60s -> 1925.60s]  Okay, i'm ready. I'll be ready
[1927.20s -> 1930.08s]  Certainly middle of the pack in terms of best times this year
[1930.48s -> 1936.64s]  However, there's no doubting the ability deep inside that body. The question mark though has been over the desire
[1937.36s -> 1944.39s]  Has to work harder at this stage 50 meters gone and already in stride
[1945.27s -> 1948.71s]  Well, this race really starting to take shape as they approach halfway
[1949.59s -> 1951.59s]  Leading the way it's island
[1951.99s -> 1955.12s]  Into what's the line here?
[1963.89s -> 1965.89s]  That's the gold medal
[1967.89s -> 1973.27s]  I want to see that. I want to see that
[1974.31s -> 1983.20s]  See how small that bar got at the very end. That's the gold medal. That's one
[1983.76s -> 1990.92s]  Don't worry. I'll get a shitload more
[1990.92s -> 2000.52s]  Wait, do I have a medal ceremony?
[2000.68s -> 2004.52s]  Is this a league game? No, so smooth from start to finish
[2005.08s -> 2008.04s]  Straight into the stride and then once in rhythm
[2012.48s -> 2014.80s]  What a performance amazing
[2017.52s -> 2021.84s]  I think I lost final check on the standings. Then what's an event? This has been
[2022.56s -> 2027.30s]  Confirmed now a gold medal for the usa. Holy shit 21.71
[2028.48s -> 2030.48s]  21.72
[2035.91s -> 2047.41s]  Zero point one. This is the moment where finally the athlete is crowned the new
[2047.73s -> 2049.73s]  Olympic champion
[2049.79s -> 2058.61s]  Emotions running high no doubt as they step onto the podium. I did it big smiles as the chris's one for the national anthem
[2060.31s -> 2062.31s]  There'll be tears flowing
[2063.27s -> 2070.69s]  Wait, that's not that's not the whole thing
[2073.57s -> 2075.57s]  condensed national
[2077.97s -> 2079.97s]  Take a commercial break
[2080.45s -> 2088.16s]  These are memories that will live long for these oh say can you see a medal from an olympic games
[2088.24s -> 2090.24s]  is
[2092.16s -> 2097.36s]  What so we'll be back let's have a look I actually forgot the national anthem had to stop I had to just get out of that
[2098.24s -> 2103.68s]  Well, that's it from the olympic stadium for now from seth bennett. We'll see you next time
[2104.56s -> 2107.89s]  I had to get out
[2107.89s -> 2109.89s]  All right. I got a gold medal. Yeah
[2111.70s -> 2114.18s]  You've had a mr. Dan couldn't jump
[2123.59s -> 2127.03s]  I got a retry token. Well, you get currency if you do well
[2127.83s -> 2133.09s]  I got three medal points. Ooh. All right day one
[2136.47s -> 2138.87s]  Campaign summary either results in the events
[2139.59s -> 2142.66s]  But did not qualify. Okay
[2142.90s -> 2144.90s]  Medal tally, let's take a look
[2147.49s -> 2149.73s]  United states one gold medal
[2150.45s -> 2152.13s]  Poland's right underneath
[2152.13s -> 2161.03s]  Important link is it find out? Yeah, that's pretty important
[2161.67s -> 2165.40s]  That mouth
[2165.40s -> 2177.41s]  Why does it have such a scary mouth?
[2178.37s -> 2193.51s]  Okay, we got women's archery under breaststroke trampoline
[2194.80s -> 2198.08s]  Rapid fire pistol. Oh, how many can I do too? That's it
[2198.96s -> 2201.70s]  I need to do all right. I want to I want to rapid fire pistol
[2203.65s -> 2205.65s]  And then I want to archery too, though
[2206.61s -> 2212.77s]  Trampoline I wish you could do more than two
[2213.41s -> 2217.96s]  Okay, men's trampoline. Here we go
[2227.84s -> 2229.84s]  Rampel how do you do?
[2230.32s -> 2232.48s]  What are you doing a trampoline lips and shit?
[2233.28s -> 2241.99s]  All right, let's do some backflip. This is me. This is me. I gotta do well these athletes equally matched
[2242.92s -> 2244.92s]  All right, select the routine
[2245.00s -> 2250.87s]  Select the tutorial routine and proceed to the next phase when selecting routine look at the difficulty and tariff before making a decision
[2250.95s -> 2252.95s]  What's the meaning tariff?
[2253.11s -> 2255.11s]  Pay taxes on my routine
[2255.72s -> 2260.52s]  The athlete will automatically build momentum. The routine moves are shown in the upper left area of the screen
[2261.64s -> 2262.92s]  Okay
[2262.92s -> 2266.00s]  So it's like circle
[2266.08s -> 2269.20s]  Square
[2269.20s -> 2271.68s]  press circle to start a tucked somersault
[2273.80s -> 2277.48s]  Press square to perform a pike shape at the start of the second somersault
[2279.20s -> 2281.60s]  New button prompts appear when you must perform each element
[2283.92s -> 2286.64s]  First down as the somersault completes to exit
[2287.20s -> 2295.38s]  You only have 70 seconds to complete all eight skills any missed skills will award zero difficulty points and occur a heavy execution penalty
[2295.70s -> 2297.70s]  And try to time your inputs
[2300.63s -> 2303.35s]  Okay, here we go
[2303.35s -> 2305.83s]  I'm gonna do like fucking five backflips
[2313.44s -> 2319.76s]  Do people like shut up in the stands like golf you would need that right they do right in 2000 in sydney
[2320.08s -> 2323.36s]  Trampolining is now very much part of the fixtures and fittings
[2323.84s -> 2327.76s]  Three times men have competed in this event and there's been three different winners
[2328.32s -> 2330.13s]  beginner
[2330.13s -> 2332.93s]  Oh, but what are they no room for error?
[2333.17s -> 2338.77s]  They only get one chance in this event so selection of the routine is germa germa germa. What what?
[2340.72s -> 2342.72s]  expert two no
[2343.12s -> 2351.84s]  Well, they only get one chance on the trampoline and they've gone for a big routine now
[2352.24s -> 2354.24s]  This will be their chance to shine
[2354.88s -> 2376.42s]  Fencing up and down just not good enough. It's the tricks that'll get in the points
[2377.22s -> 2381.86s]  I'm doing them. How do I do other skills? I know one move. How do I do other moves?
[2381.94s -> 2387.72s]  Just jumping up and down isn't going to score him any points here. Oh shit. There it is really executes that beautifully
[2388.82s -> 2392.40s]  Oh fantastic
[2393.11s -> 2399.01s]  And he really needs to get the tricks in now great work with the routine there shit
[2402.00s -> 2407.28s]  That was a triple. I just did a triple skill level out there ideally
[2407.36s -> 2410.88s]  He needs to finish that routine on his feet not his front
[2411.76s -> 2414.56s]  Come on. We really need to see the routine now. Come on
[2415.44s -> 2420.05s]  Oh showing great technique there
[2421.09s -> 2425.41s]  He's not gonna get far in this competition. Just jumping up and down i'm doing it
[2426.13s -> 2439.51s]  I'm gonna recap on that one now. Here's the replay
[2440.47s -> 2447.01s]  Oh, that was sick. These are incredible moves. Oh
[2449.36s -> 2453.12s]  Oh, I can't I get it. I was doing the same move over and over again
[2475.17s -> 2492.02s]  Finally there's the other move it's that same spin. Okay. All right. All right what I get six
[2492.58s -> 2494.58s]  Intrigued to know what the judges think
[2495.38s -> 2504.08s]  Oh showing frustration more than anything. They know that performance just wasn't up to scratch today
[2505.91s -> 2511.19s]  Well, that's all the action we have for you now from this event time now to hand back over to Seth bennett
[2511.91s -> 2514.25s]  That's your commentator alison kerbishly
[2517.83s -> 2528.07s]  I looked over the chat somebody just said fucking loser. How does this work?
[2530.12s -> 2533.80s]  To the world artillery barracks here in the artillery barracks
[2534.28s -> 2538.04s]  This should be a great venue for the shooting events. I feel like throw grenades
[2540.36s -> 2542.36s]  rapid fire pistol
[2543.51s -> 2548.87s]  Until 1984 men and women regularly competed against one another in the shooting event
[2549.96s -> 2552.90s]  What is this?
[2554.84s -> 2561.68s]  Is that that is a grenade i'm holding a grenade. What's a grenade in my hand? Oh, no, it's not. Oh, dear
[2563.54s -> 2565.94s]  R2 r2 to shoot
[2574.80s -> 2577.12s]  Kind of good
[2577.12s -> 2581.92s]  Time limit per round reduces across the event the final two rounds last for only four seconds
[2582.48s -> 2589.22s]  For the best results aim the pistol in one continuous motion to shoot all the targets as quickly as possible
[2590.10s -> 2603.00s]  To say these athletes can afford to make a mistake today any slip ups and then they won't I came right from the trampoline
[2603.72s -> 2607.75s]  Okay, here we go. You gotta be quick
[2610.32s -> 2615.84s]  Can I just shoot the same target in five different places eight seconds to hit five targets
[2616.48s -> 2618.48s]  We go three two one
[2619.12s -> 2631.60s]  Oh, I got it. Okay. All right. All right. All right. We got I got six out of there. I got a six. It's okay
[2632.24s -> 2634.88s]  Always good to get on the leaderboard in the first round
[2637.83s -> 2638.87s]  Round two
[2638.87s -> 2646.63s]  Let's get I only have four seconds to do this at the end. Okay six seconds
[2656.93s -> 2667.75s]  The results on the scoreboard aren't good
[2668.39s -> 2670.39s]  And some way behind the leaders
[2672.52s -> 2674.52s]  It's nerve-racking, okay
[2674.76s -> 2678.69s]  I'll get it this time
[2678.69s -> 2681.41s]  Thanks up round three. Let's go six seconds
[2690.82s -> 2691.94s]  Okay
[2691.94s -> 2700.32s]  All right, I brought it back
[2701.68s -> 2703.68s]  Let's go i'll pull this back
[2708.07s -> 2710.71s]  Okay, do I have a red dot four seconds
[2719.44s -> 2722.55s]  Oh
[2722.55s -> 2729.27s]  That's hard as hell
[2729.27s -> 2732.79s]  I gotta get into fourth place fourth place is placing right place
[2734.08s -> 2737.68s]  No, wait, this isn't mario kart. It's not like bronze two
[2738.24s -> 2740.37s]  I need to get third
[2740.37s -> 2748.02s]  Number five this gets really tough as the scoring rings tighten
[2752.66s -> 2753.62s]  shit
[2753.62s -> 2766.28s]  That's it. I gotta pull the other four. All right, let's go team usa in one more round. I gotta nail this one
[2767.00s -> 2780.31s]  Number six then final round to make this one count
[2780.87s -> 2788.63s]  The fuck out of here. I'll take second place right now. Let's pull it back up through a silver medal
[2793.76s -> 2796.20s]  fourth place
[2797.56s -> 2799.56s]  At least i'm mario kart placed
[2819.12s -> 2822.64s]  I'm using a retry token
[2828.52s -> 2837.20s]  Wait that was wait that wasn't wait what hold on a second that was wait, hold on
[2838.00s -> 2840.96s]  That was just for the qualifying that was not for the medal
[2845.64s -> 2849.34s]  I just retried a qualifier with a retry token
[2852.29s -> 2856.85s]  Oh, well, he looked so upset. Did you see him? He was holding his head. He's like i lost I didn't know
[2857.33s -> 2859.33s]  You'd be qualified what?
[2860.88s -> 2867.97s]  If you qualified you'd be happy. Why would he be so upset on the screen? It's all right. It gives me practice
[2876.34s -> 2878.42s]  Six seconds to hit five targets
[2878.90s -> 2891.59s]  Pressures on i'm gonna take the second place to qualifying four seconds then to hit the five targets. This is a good practice
[2893.03s -> 2899.36s]  Yeah, i'm gonna nail it now. I've got the rhythm
[2905.99s -> 2907.43s]  Second place
[2907.43s -> 2918.71s]  Here's round five then five targets four seconds to hit them. I'll take first place at the real actual medal event
[2919.35s -> 2925.65s]  Team usa so far and the scoreboard confirms it there in first place
[2926.29s -> 2932.29s]  Here we go round six then the final round has to shoot well here and he did
[2935.41s -> 2937.73s]  First place then now he's happy. I needed to be happy
[2943.09s -> 2947.97s]  To produce your best at the olympic games is all anyone why do they need a replay for this?
[2949.01s -> 2952.68s]  Well, let's take a check on the final standings in the top three. All right
[2953.40s -> 2959.89s]  In this one men's 20, it's rapid fire pistol. This is the one that counts I have one
[2960.93s -> 2971.56s]  return token
[2976.96s -> 2980.90s]  All right, come on me go i gotta be clean
[2983.46s -> 2987.30s]  Round one, let's do it. Eight seconds to hit the five targets
[2988.18s -> 2990.18s]  plenty of time
[2992.36s -> 2994.60s]  All right, it's okay. All right. That's all right. That's the second
[2995.24s -> 3001.09s]  It's really tight at the top of that scoreboard at the end of that round
[3001.81s -> 3006.77s]  And with this show just how good competition this is at this stage first shot was fucked up. Yeah it was
[3008.02s -> 3010.82s]  Here we go round two then two seconds off the clock
[3011.54s -> 3013.38s]  Same number of targets
[3013.38s -> 3021.19s]  That's all right. That's good. Good. Keep it locked in first place
[3028.10s -> 3037.04s]  94 94 tied what happens if it is tight round three
[3037.92s -> 3046.08s]  Here we go
[3046.08s -> 3049.36s]  Oh, there was like a loud sound outside. It didn't fuck me up
[3052.79s -> 3054.79s]  First place
[3058.79s -> 3061.77s]  All right, I can lose it really quickly here don't get overconfident
[3064.04s -> 3071.20s]  This is the four seconds
[3073.60s -> 3083.56s]  What happened why did it fire twice oh my fucking god, why did it go pop pop
[3083.96s -> 3087.88s]  Decent performance the pressure sensitive bullshit of the biggie
[3088.68s -> 3096.13s]  Needs to remain accurate here. Come the fuck on
[3099.60s -> 3102.24s]  You gotta be kidding me, dude. Are you serious?
[3106.04s -> 3108.76s]  I don't think I can even do that double tap again if I wanted to
[3109.40s -> 3114.64s]  On the sixth round five targets four seconds can't make a mistake here in the final round
[3119.94s -> 3124.90s]  I'm thinking if somebody did that they missed twice and they went like oh my god
[3128.28s -> 3133.40s]  What happened did I win here's the replay of that I got a bronze medal
[3133.96s -> 3144.12s]  And can you take gold in this event a real performance from this athlete?
[3145.08s -> 3149.73s]  Plenty of smiles in the hungarian campus this athlete takes home a silver medal
[3152.79s -> 3166.02s]  This is a proud moment for this athlete retry. No, I can't I need to save it. Have fun with your bronze medal
[3166.58s -> 3171.08s]  A bronze is fine
[3171.08s -> 3182.15s]  No, i'm not gonna retry it
[3188.10s -> 3194.66s]  Traditionally at the olympic games it runs one gold another fantastic achievement
[3205.70s -> 3207.70s]  Why is it so sad to look at that screen?
[3211.20s -> 3216.02s]  Okay, I want to do the archery. I'm gonna do archery. What's
[3216.74s -> 3219.12s]  K-ring
[3219.12s -> 3224.42s]  Oh, this is discus throw. I'm gonna do k-ring. I don't know what that means
[3224.98s -> 3232.77s]  I'm gonna do it
[3232.77s -> 3235.09s]  Wait, do we is this gonna we get gold medal glenn here?
[3246.48s -> 3248.16s]  Okay, here we go. This is
[3248.16s -> 3251.33s]  archery
[3251.33s -> 3255.36s]  Come on glenn where's the bow?
[3258.13s -> 3264.53s]  The boy this is gonna run around like stab stuff. It was so important in the 14th century. It was compulsory. Oh, okay
[3265.91s -> 3266.79s]  hold
[3266.79s -> 3272.10s]  Hard to draw the bow
[3272.18s -> 3275.94s]  Use l to aim release r quickly to fire the arrow
[3279.17s -> 3280.05s]  All right
[3280.05s -> 3283.86s]  Flight's affected by the wind be sure to compensate for wind strength
[3285.30s -> 3286.58s]  Is drop?
[3286.58s -> 3290.40s]  Okay, 20 seconds before the shots forward you got it
[3294.40s -> 3296.40s]  All right, come on christin reed
[3301.48s -> 3308.47s]  Kristen reed's going for the gold number one two megabits per second up to the top left
[3331.28s -> 3334.10s]  That's not a bullseye
[3337.84s -> 3339.84s]  Two miles per hour that way that's
[3344.80s -> 3347.28s]  It doesn't think two miles per hour was gonna be that big of a deal
[3348.24s -> 3359.92s]  That's a qualify that's pretty sick let's have a look at the leaderboard then yeah that I did great after the first end
[3361.28s -> 3363.12s]  meters per second
[3363.12s -> 3365.12s]  So that's actually like six
[3366.13s -> 3368.50s]  Seven miles per hour
[3368.50s -> 3371.14s]  Why are we doing um dumb dumb from the united states boy?
[3371.22s -> 3375.78s]  Why come they don't do how come they don't convert every single thing for the one country on earth?
[3375.78s -> 3379.94s]  That doesn't care to do the metric system. Why couldn't do why don't you do that for me?
[3380.42s -> 3390.08s]  I expect you to do everything twice. So I understand it. This is it
[3392.61s -> 3398.32s]  This is heavy wind up. Thank you
[3405.75s -> 3415.46s]  Thank you
[3420.79s -> 3423.03s]  This is actually fun
[3423.19s -> 3424.55s]  I like this
[3424.55s -> 3436.18s]  There's a flat earth competition at the olympics. I don't know what that means. Let's have a look at the scoreboard
[3436.58s -> 3439.06s]  Is that like just bring a bunch of beer and yell at each other?
[3439.22s -> 3442.18s]  And they've done an argue about it. What do you what do you do? I don't know what that means
[3442.26s -> 3445.62s]  This certainly isn't theirs to be taking for granted at this stage
[3446.50s -> 3454.95s]  What do you have a competition?
[3454.95s -> 3460.63s]  Uh, I think I think you're looking for debate and the competitors will shoot towards the magnificent media center
[3460.63s -> 3463.67s]  You compare the planets to see what one is the flattest
[3469.36s -> 3473.68s]  This is arrow number two for this athlete I need a bullseye right here. You gotta do it quick
[3479.54s -> 3487.11s]  Almost hit the other one
[3487.11s -> 3490.56s]  That's a qualification right there
[3496.04s -> 3498.04s]  Yeah, if I just play like that i'll be fine
[3499.56s -> 3510.15s]  This is the final end let's try to hit the other target
[3513.52s -> 3519.54s]  This is the final end only two hours to go. I mean two hours to go
[3520.98s -> 3531.99s]  It seems like a long time
[3531.99s -> 3534.65s]  Damn, I can't get in that middle. It's magnetized
[3537.72s -> 3539.72s]  two arrows, oh
[3543.09s -> 3549.03s]  two hours
[3549.03s -> 3551.03s]  I thought I thought he said hours
[3555.54s -> 3559.62s]  All right, here comes. Okay, quality finally. Will this be can I finally qualify for two events?
[3562.77s -> 3571.97s]  Men's hiring finish cycling. Oh boy, this is gonna be interesting
[3572.61s -> 3583.43s]  This has been described as a
[3583.99s -> 3586.15s]  Is doug dopamine here? What his name is?
[3587.43s -> 3593.96s]  And dope six of the world's best trying to make it through to this olympic final. There's what is the name dope?
[3594.44s -> 3601.56s]  Doping doping. Yeah hasn't been a good event for team usa never once finishing on the podium in the three occasions. How does this work?
[3606.80s -> 3608.70s]  Oh, I can't go that way
[3608.70s -> 3610.48s]  repeatedly tap
[3610.48s -> 3612.48s]  Oh, yeah, you're gonna see
[3617.09s -> 3619.09s]  Hold down x to cruise
[3620.55s -> 3624.04s]  Oh, I see you use the stamina push
[3624.84s -> 3626.68s]  And hold to move
[3626.68s -> 3636.56s]  How many people are on the track when we do this?
[3639.94s -> 3651.22s]  Okay, I know how to steer
[3651.22s -> 3659.30s]  Sprinting uses stamina cruising regain stamina slipstream behind opponents to quickly regain stamina. All right
[3665.76s -> 3679.12s]  Am I all the way at the end just like bullying everybody
[3687.68s -> 3694.98s]  You ain't fucking passing me
[3694.98s -> 3697.94s]  This is what it sucks. That's why it sucks to be cold versus koopa
[3708.12s -> 3721.08s]  You ain't getting by me. You're getting by me. Good luck. I thought it was putting his hand throw punch
[3721.72s -> 3729.17s]  Performance is no denying that as we take another look at the isn't what i'm doing illegal
[3731.72s -> 3733.16s]  You can't do that
[3733.16s -> 3746.36s]  Let's take a check on the official results then following that race like I can get this
[3747.00s -> 3749.00s]  All right. This is this is where it counts
[3749.00s -> 3752.20s]  It's called blocking. It's illegal
[3754.90s -> 3756.90s]  Can I get two goals back to back?
[3761.70s -> 3763.70s]  They don't care
[3765.25s -> 3767.25s]  All right christen, let's go
[3767.73s -> 3769.73s]  I'm ready
[3771.33s -> 3786.04s]  Wait, what I can pump the crowd up. All right now I can't just whip it
[3794.42s -> 3803.81s]  Having seen the first arrow what adjustments will this athlete make here we go. All right
[3804.93s -> 3808.77s]  Good shot required to finish end one on the high
[3813.41s -> 3816.37s]  That's not wait. That's the exact same spot
[3817.01s -> 3819.44s]  That was the same arrow
[3823.68s -> 3827.40s]  It replaced the other one. Holy shit
[3828.52s -> 3832.44s]  Expected the united states make a strong start to this. Okay, I gotta be better
[3833.08s -> 3835.40s]  25 26. I gotta get that gold medal
[3838.74s -> 3841.22s]  I'm gonna pump the crowd up again. How do I do that square?
[3843.30s -> 3845.38s]  Still on a breathless day at lords
[3846.02s -> 3851.08s]  There it is
[3867.44s -> 3875.00s]  No wind
[3875.00s -> 3877.00s]  Yep
[3883.67s -> 3888.87s]  Hold back the points from the seven not bad. Let's see if we're good first place
[3891.59s -> 3894.79s]  Two more chances I can overtake it. I know I can
[3907.49s -> 3911.86s]  That's a ten that cream that top number
[3919.27s -> 3921.86s]  Oh, yeah
[3921.86s -> 3931.97s]  Let's get 30. I'll fall into first place. I'll get that gold medal. I can smell it. Oh, that's all right
[3931.97s -> 3933.97s]  More to the total for that
[3941.27s -> 3945.97s]  29 it's good. That's a good score
[3949.57s -> 3962.74s]  Three points ahead on the scoreboard do it again every wind here
[3973.01s -> 3976.37s]  That could have been that wind changed on me right when I was about to let go did you see that
[3983.65s -> 3984.37s]  Oh
[3984.37s -> 3996.64s]  It was seven did it change to seven? Oh man. That was a huge amount of fucking wind
[3997.28s -> 4006.07s]  Britain's gonna fuck it up
[4006.07s -> 4010.95s]  No, they're gonna have just as much trouble. I'm gonna be in first place still where we go first place. I told you gold medal
[4012.47s -> 4015.19s]  Those double tens back to back last round really saved it
[4018.92s -> 4022.63s]  Told you close
[4024.37s -> 4026.37s]  Close
[4033.89s -> 4039.01s]  Here we go here comes
[4040.85s -> 4043.43s]  Nice work kristen second gold medal
[4046.08s -> 4048.64s]  And
[4093.32s -> 4096.20s]  I completely forgot about the happy birthday shit
[4097.51s -> 4099.51s]  from the green screen day
[4099.51s -> 4115.70s]  Can you get a minus two permanently?
[4116.10s -> 4118.05s]  No
[4118.05s -> 4124.37s]  That's not you can't do that. It's the final of the men's care. All right. Remember the tactic here is fully
[4128.20s -> 4130.04s]  The goal here is
[4130.04s -> 4136.60s]  Square in the circle peg hole thing just get it in there futuristic approach to this like a baby toy
[4136.92s -> 4142.20s]  Specifically designed get the square just it's not supposed to fit but you're gonna get the square into the circle
[4142.36s -> 4147.41s]  It's in the shape of their lives and there's no reason why they can't go
[4147.49s -> 4156.84s]  To win a medal here
[4172.39s -> 4192.69s]  Am I getting booed just don't let him go by you wait, why is he taller? Why is he flying?
[4192.77s -> 4194.21s]  Do you see he's flying?
[4194.21s -> 4206.26s]  Did you see that? He like grew two times in size and was floating
[4206.90s -> 4213.80s]  It's another gold medal
[4214.52s -> 4229.73s]  Plenty of heart plenty of energy plenty of passion and most of all plenty of power. He almost came inside world
[4233.19s -> 4235.19s]  There we go, here it comes
[4235.27s -> 4240.61s]  Well, this is the moment where we can enjoy success and certainly they'll be doing that on the podium
[4241.25s -> 4243.33s]  Time for the national anthems to celebrate
[4243.97s -> 4250.71s]  Let's take a quick check on the overall medal tally three golds one bronze
[4251.43s -> 4257.73s]  That concludes things for the day no more events remaining in this session so from seth bennett and all the team
[4258.13s -> 4261.97s]  Will bid you a fond farewell skip skip skip you skipped
[4264.02s -> 4265.78s]  No, that's just
[4265.78s -> 4267.86s]  That's abbreviated
[4267.86s -> 4273.22s]  They look they abbreviated it already. So i'm just like I didn't I pressed x. I didn't know I was gonna skip it completely
[4277.11s -> 4279.11s]  I unlocked spain's outfit
[4279.75s -> 4288.82s]  cool, I guess
[4291.72s -> 4293.72s]  All right, what's next two events
[4295.30s -> 4298.18s]  Press stroke disc throw and weightlifting. Yeah
[4302.37s -> 4304.37s]  We need to do disc throw
[4304.45s -> 4313.04s]  Is there wrestling? I don't know. There's a lot
[4314.40s -> 4318.32s]  there is
[4318.32s -> 4322.12s]  45 different events and I think some of those are
[4323.08s -> 4327.56s]  25 meter 50 meter 100 meter, right? It's supposed to be 40 events
[4330.18s -> 4333.40s]  This throw i'm ready
[4333.40s -> 4338.92s]  Put it in 3d is one of the oldest events to feature in the olympic games. How does this work?
[4339.56s -> 4341.64s]  Push and hold r don't release the stick
[4343.75s -> 4348.71s]  When the ring appears push and hold r this way don't release r until all three
[4349.75s -> 4355.97s]  what
[4355.97s -> 4360.13s]  When the ring appears push don't really what the fuck are you trying to get me to do?
[4361.38s -> 4363.68s]  Okay, let's try that again
[4363.68s -> 4365.12s]  push this way
[4365.12s -> 4368.37s]  Okay, when the ring appears push the other way
[4373.35s -> 4375.35s]  Don't release it now. Okay, push this way
[4376.32s -> 4378.34s]  push this way
[4378.34s -> 4383.57s]  Push that way again push when the ring appears release r
[4389.09s -> 4392.45s]  Best throw flick when the yellow line is in the middle of the blue zone
[4396.55s -> 4406.47s]  Okay
[4409.27s -> 4414.63s]  Here we go certainly put the pressure on with germany lithuania and estonia all taking medals
[4415.67s -> 4419.25s]  That's all right. That's pretty good power and then
[4423.22s -> 4431.64s]  So it's a foul but here's the scoreboard and that tells its own story
[4436.07s -> 4438.07s]  This is qualifying i'll get it
[4439.35s -> 4443.36s]  round two
[4443.36s -> 4445.36s]  power lock flick it
[4456.13s -> 4458.45s]  I'm not gonna qualify i'm not gonna qualify
[4468.82s -> 4474.76s]  It's good
[4480.87s -> 4483.03s]  I have to really clean this up right now
[4483.11s -> 4485.11s]  Eighth place
[4485.11s -> 4493.89s]  I'm gonna do a high angle
[4493.89s -> 4495.89s]  That's what we call it's going out of the stadium
[4496.53s -> 4499.17s]  I just broke a record
[4499.17s -> 4505.32s]  That'll bring me back to like fourth place
[4505.88s -> 4507.88s]  That put me in first place
[4507.88s -> 4517.70s]  That apparently was so good that I went from eighth to first
[4519.30s -> 4521.30s]  I can't laugh
[4523.62s -> 4525.62s]  Don't laugh
[4538.37s -> 4540.37s]  All right, I qualify I qualify
[4542.04s -> 4548.00s]  The u.s.a
[4548.00s -> 4563.56s]  Power new
[4563.56s -> 4567.40s]  When I broke the olympic record in the qualifying round
[4574.36s -> 4577.00s]  Why can't I do that during the actual competition? Does it?
[4589.76s -> 4594.79s]  Shit
[4594.79s -> 4597.41s]  Hey, but I gotta make it count
[4597.41s -> 4599.41s]  You can hit 500 home runs
[4600.13s -> 4603.65s]  In the exhibition games, but in the playoffs if you go 0 for 10
[4604.93s -> 4606.69s]  That's what people remember
[4612.52s -> 4623.04s]  It's true. All right, here comes weightlifting
[4624.60s -> 4627.02s]  Over 155 kilograms
[4633.22s -> 4640.71s]  Here we go original one and two handlers at the first two olympic games
[4645.64s -> 4648.77s]  How does weightlifting work
[4648.77s -> 4651.09s]  Tap x you must build power above the indicator
[4655.09s -> 4657.41s]  Pull l and r down simultaneously
[4658.13s -> 4661.49s]  Push l and r up simultaneously not pushing straight loses power
[4666.21s -> 4668.05s]  All right
[4668.05s -> 4671.49s]  Tap x until the judges turn wild turn white what?
[4672.21s -> 4678.15s]  Oh the light, right?
[4678.15s -> 4689.65s]  Okay, you can only attempt three lifts. So make each one count
[4690.29s -> 4693.75s]  Try to lift as straight as possible for maximum power
[4694.23s -> 4697.19s]  The athlete will start to tremble when he's about to drop the bar
[4698.15s -> 4701.22s]  Okay, let's do it
[4701.22s -> 4710.10s]  Competing in qualifying in the weightlifting. It's the first round and this athlete has to choose what weight they want to come in on
[4711.51s -> 4713.11s]  Rack the whole thing
[4713.11s -> 4716.23s]  If he doesn't get this right, he'll be very disappointed
[4717.03s -> 4726.23s]  Couldn't get them to budge what strange effort that I was tapping x
[4729.38s -> 4738.68s]  What happened? You're gonna get a good idea as to exactly how this lifter feels tap x right successful with the first attempt
[4739.64s -> 4742.52s]  But will he throw more weight on the bar for round two?
[4744.85s -> 4749.25s]  What well doesn't manage to lift anything here do I have a timer of like two seconds
[4750.13s -> 4757.43s]  I want to lower the weight down
[4757.51s -> 4761.08s]  I don't okay. I'm trying to adjust the weight. It won't let me
[4761.64s -> 4770.71s]  Well, this is the final attempt for this athlete
[4771.27s -> 4775.84s]  Obviously the nerves are at an absolute premium here
[4776.80s -> 4783.03s]  Well, you can see the athlete very frustrated with that. You make it all the way to the olympics
[4783.97s -> 4788.53s]  And you say hey put put on like 500 pounds dude
[4790.53s -> 4792.53s]  Take it off an inch off the ground
[4792.69s -> 4796.13s]  Holy shit, that's so embarrassing. I want to should I redo it?
[4797.99s -> 4799.99s]  I couldn't even take any off
[4804.69s -> 4807.01s]  Retry token. No, no, no
[4807.81s -> 4810.50s]  It's all right. I got the disc throw
[4811.16s -> 4813.16s]  I was just tapping x why couldn't I
[4813.72s -> 4816.84s]  I wasn't doing anything else
[4816.84s -> 4821.56s]  It was like tap x to you till you get to the power and then you press down with both and up with both
[4821.56s -> 4823.56s]  I didn't get a chance to press down
[4823.56s -> 4828.61s]  Welcome to this beautiful
[4831.17s -> 4837.01s]  All right, here comes the guy with the world records what a value this is are you ready for this world record
[4838.20s -> 4840.20s]  Pump them up
[4840.52s -> 4850.56s]  The athlete will spin around as fast as possible before releasing the discus all two kilograms of it
[4854.40s -> 4856.40s]  Get that out of here. That's a perfect throw
[4856.72s -> 4864.36s]  Full power. I just broke I broke the world. That's a world record. I went I don't have to do anything else game over
[4865.32s -> 4874.63s]  Can I just leave
[4874.63s -> 4875.19s]  Can they okay?
[4875.19s -> 4878.23s]  Can we just stop the event just give me the gold medal I could watch the rest of the event
[4878.55s -> 4900.47s]  All right. Now I have to beat the world record that I just made nerves should be gone by now. This guy's a fucking maniac
[4902.45s -> 4904.05s]  Oh damn it
[4904.05s -> 4906.05s]  That world record
[4914.07s -> 4917.91s]  Nobody can do anything to catch this athlete now, I need 75
[4918.71s -> 4924.28s]  Can you imagine being in the olympics?
[4924.92s -> 4929.72s]  You train for 10 years to get here and the first guy that gets up for the first heat
[4930.60s -> 4932.52s]  Breaks the world record
[4932.52s -> 4944.49s]  You want to talk about just completely demoralizing?
[4958.90s -> 4960.90s]  I don't think i'll ever get past 70 for six
[4967.32s -> 4973.68s]  Justice is back full power break the record
[4976.50s -> 4979.72s]  oops
[4979.72s -> 4981.72s]  Sorry, it's still in play
[4988.72s -> 4990.72s]  Doesn't matter
[4991.20s -> 4993.92s]  I just i'm not gonna be able to do it. I'm just throwing it into the ground
[4994.40s -> 5012.37s]  Should I bm this is round number five then i'm trying to let it go. I'm just trying to drop it
[5027.60s -> 5029.60s]  All right, i'm going for it again
[5030.64s -> 5032.64s]  They're in first place
[5032.96s -> 5040.36s]  Y'all fuck off. Whatever. I got the record who cares
[5060.63s -> 5064.21s]  We just did olympic records
[5064.85s -> 5068.13s]  Let's have a look at the replay he's not even human
[5069.25s -> 5072.21s]  The approach really the release point great
[5072.85s -> 5078.82s]  And it just came down to the distance fantastic. Holy shit. That cameraman really is messing up
[5079.94s -> 5084.92s]  Like I took pictures two or three seconds after it landed. It's horrible
[5094.05s -> 5097.03s]  That's like two or three thousand milliseconds lag
[5103.54s -> 5105.54s]  Training
[5120.53s -> 5127.09s]  Next song celebrations will begin. Um, well, that's the end of the day plays if you win plenty more action to come
[5127.49s -> 5129.49s]  Okay, we got four gold medals
[5130.29s -> 5135.67s]  I want to take a look at the standard metal tally. Let's see
[5136.39s -> 5139.01s]  Oh, i'm just i'm killing
[5140.44s -> 5142.29s]  four
[5142.29s -> 5150.42s]  four golds
[5150.42s -> 5152.76s]  Javelin throw you got it. Absolutely
[5156.99s -> 5158.99s]  freestyle of swimming
[5160.61s -> 5163.43s]  kayaking
[5163.43s -> 5164.31s]  Okay
[5164.31s -> 5166.55s]  kayaking iking and javelin throw
[5167.35s -> 5171.88s]  Wait, do we get to use?
[5171.88s -> 5173.88s]  uh the record holder
[5173.88s -> 5176.69s]  I feel like if he if he could throw a disc that will
[5177.41s -> 5180.74s]  Just give him a javelin teach him that too
[5185.11s -> 5189.67s]  Yeah, any object that you just have to throw hard. It's really fun. Just teach him everything
[5190.23s -> 5196.24s]  Olympic games always has a strong dan. Okay
[5198.20s -> 5200.45s]  Oh boy
[5200.45s -> 5202.21s]  Have to begin running
[5202.21s -> 5207.73s]  Have to fill the bar
[5207.73s -> 5208.77s]  pull
[5208.77s -> 5211.00s]  push
[5211.00s -> 5216.24s]  The perfect angle is 35 degrees
[5218.37s -> 5220.93s]  Okay, I didn't have very much time to process that. Okay
[5226.20s -> 5228.20s]  Don't get that much time to do this
[5228.52s -> 5246.26s]  Starts the run now. What where's the foul line? What because I stepped over it after throwing this one
[5246.90s -> 5256.58s]  There's no point measuring it that throw won't because it's a foul if he goes in round number two
[5261.24s -> 5266.74s]  Get out of here. Come on
[5269.09s -> 5273.03s]  68 confirmation on the standings. I want to beat another world record
[5273.67s -> 5277.19s]  I can never reach that high again and it sucks. I want to do it
[5288.42s -> 5292.44s]  Beat the olympic record. Oh just personal best
[5304.40s -> 5306.56s]  Should be no nerves now in round number four
[5314.34s -> 5316.34s]  I fucked it up
[5318.34s -> 5320.34s]  Sorry, I'm still on the first place
[5325.19s -> 5331.80s]  Here we go again then in round five of the javelin I get it. All right, it's gonna get more speed
[5339.11s -> 5339.75s]  Okay
[5339.75s -> 5345.11s]  If you had to stand out there and just stand with your arms to your sides and stand straight up and not move at all
[5346.28s -> 5349.64s]  And this dude got three attempts to throw the javelin at you
[5350.63s -> 5354.02s]  Would you do that for a hundred grand?
[5354.02s -> 5360.96s]  Do you think he would be that accurate to get you? I don't know. I feel like it'd be hard to be that accurate
[5361.36s -> 5377.86s]  It's a lot of money. Yeah, yeah, because yo you have to stand still. Yeah
[5378.50s -> 5385.86s]  And there's there's like an operation style device that's on your body that if you move it goes
[5386.74s -> 5393.67s]  And then just did the 100 grand is removed disqualified. So we're gonna come down to this the delivery
[5398.28s -> 5414.72s]  36 degrees
[5415.68s -> 5421.67s]  Washed up don't throw so early. It's freaking me out because I stepped over the line once good technique
[5423.09s -> 5425.09s]  absolutely rock solid technique
[5426.05s -> 5430.08s]  I just gotta get one or two good ones. That'll be good
[5432.96s -> 5435.36s]  All right, here comes kayaking this one's gonna be interesting
[5436.80s -> 5445.10s]  If he gets too close, i'll just move. Yeah, you can just be like, all right, whatever i'm gonna take
[5448.16s -> 5456.67s]  This looks pretty cool
[5461.12s -> 5463.60s]  Wait, did more than one person do this event at the same time?
[5465.60s -> 5469.31s]  Isn't that kind of dangerous? Why is this like a mario kart level?
[5470.59s -> 5472.58s]  Is it like this?
[5472.58s -> 5480.67s]  Until the final big drop big man. Let's have a look at everybody. I didn't even do the tutorial. Oh, yeah, I did
[5481.15s -> 5483.71s]  Okay l is used to propel and turn
[5486.21s -> 5488.05s]  hold while turning
[5488.05s -> 5490.35s]  Hold x and boost forward
[5490.91s -> 5495.98s]  Paddle downstream through the green and white holes to successfully complete
[5501.42s -> 5506.86s]  Hold well to paddle past the red and white holes uptrend gates must be completed while moving back to the course
[5509.46s -> 5511.46s]  Hold r2 to plant the paddle
[5511.70s -> 5513.22s]  quickly turn
[5513.30s -> 5517.58s]  Right towards the gate
[5517.58s -> 5520.06s]  Turn and paddle upstream between the red and white bulls
[5528.60s -> 5530.60s]  struggling a little later
[5532.30s -> 5537.36s]  Leave the athlete
[5537.44s -> 5547.97s]  Uh, there's eight people here. It's gonna be a mess
[5553.22s -> 5556.58s]  Wait, am I cheating what happened? Why do I have a 10 second head start?
[5558.18s -> 5564.06s]  What hold on am I gonna get a penalty for that?
[5565.82s -> 5568.54s]  It's a tricky approach into ben nevis here
[5569.26s -> 5571.26s]  Have to slow down to get through that gate
[5575.94s -> 5577.94s]  What is just me
[5577.94s -> 5582.10s]  Is to stay dry through this upstream gate
[5582.82s -> 5587.90s]  While this gate proved to be a little problematic, but now what are you talking about?
[5589.74s -> 5593.74s]  Completely missed altogether great great comes this athlete
[5602.19s -> 5609.25s]  Did I duck under it I'm sorry, it doesn't matter what game it is
[5609.49s -> 5610.69s]  Is
[5610.69s -> 5615.57s]  It's just all I think of is connect whenever I see a kayak or any water sport for that matter
[5615.81s -> 5621.49s]  Just just connect this is microsoft connect presents minigame. That's all I think of is just minigame microsoft connect. That's it
[5622.77s -> 5626.37s]  And it sucks because this is a really difficult thing to do. This is really hard
[5627.17s -> 5629.41s]  This is like a really just grueling sport
[5631.07s -> 5633.07s]  And it has been dropped in my brain too
[5633.47s -> 5635.47s]  Funny connect game
[5637.31s -> 5648.75s]  That's all right, I did all right
[5649.95s -> 5651.23s]  Brilliant
[5651.23s -> 5658.99s]  Does not look brilliant does not look like a guy that knows that he's doing this looks like you just took a guy
[5658.99s -> 5660.99s]  From the audience and put him in here
[5661.55s -> 5666.75s]  Oh pretty good time for somebody that we just pulled from the subway
[5667.63s -> 5670.96s]  We gave him 50 dollars
[5671.04s -> 5678.72s]  He said go for it
[5680.94s -> 5686.99s]  Well, this is the final scoreboard holy shit, I did really really well
[5689.49s -> 5691.97s]  Well team USA with this is the important one here
[5696.05s -> 5698.77s]  Am I is this olympic little league?
[5699.33s -> 5701.41s]  Am I in competition with like 13 year olds?
[5710.56s -> 5717.36s]  Everybody literally sucks at kayaking. It doesn't matter how good you actually are does it athletes all come through the qualifying rounds
[5718.80s -> 5720.80s]  All right, I gotta get a good one
[5721.28s -> 5728.88s]  This is for the medal attempt number one that good speed
[5731.46s -> 5734.18s]  Good angle and that's a snapshot moment
[5739.92s -> 5747.86s]  Right underneath the olympic record damn
[5750.02s -> 5752.42s]  Comes to a close a little too early
[5753.78s -> 5755.78s]  A huge lead in this one
[5756.58s -> 5768.13s]  This is the second round. Why is that so slow? This looks very good
[5769.01s -> 5775.57s]  Well, that's going to be a foul needs to stop before the line
[5776.77s -> 5778.61s]  Why did I fall down?
[5778.61s -> 5784.13s]  A wonderful performance so far and the results on the scoreboard are just as electrifying
[5784.61s -> 5789.01s]  They know it's a terrific terrific lead that this athlete takes from here
[5789.97s -> 5793.94s]  Third round of the javelin now
[5796.62s -> 5798.62s]  I fell down. Is it a foul if you fall?
[5799.26s -> 5808.34s]  But he just looks stupid
[5808.34s -> 5811.94s]  Midway through this event and the USA are in first place
[5813.38s -> 5816.06s]  Throw it straight i'm trying
[5817.18s -> 5819.26s]  Fourth attempt this two more remain
[5820.22s -> 5822.22s]  Oh, this is bad
[5822.62s -> 5825.42s]  Who cares just throw it on whatever that was a horrible one, but
[5826.38s -> 5832.51s]  You won't get close to his personal best with 50 community subs from who suck mick jones
[5835.76s -> 5837.76s]  Thanks for the 50 subs
[5838.96s -> 5841.68s]  That's insane on the scoreboard 50 community sub
[5842.56s -> 5845.95s]  One's for you. You ready?
[5845.95s -> 5849.23s]  This one's for the 50 subs. I'm going to break the fucking world record right here
[5852.37s -> 5857.58s]  Next one goes up. It's high and it's long
[5858.30s -> 5860.30s]  Not quite the right trajectory though
[5860.78s -> 5863.18s]  Not a great throw. We only need one to win
[5864.46s -> 5867.02s]  Okay, this is it. I'm gonna break it at least their olympic record later
[5870.58s -> 5872.82s]  Six and final round then for this athlete
[5877.38s -> 5879.94s]  Nope, it wasn't going fast enough shit. Sorry
[5883.73s -> 5886.10s]  He's in 50 subs
[5888.70s -> 5890.70s]  That's still gold medal I still win
[5894.19s -> 5896.88s]  Here is the replay
[5897.04s -> 5904.21s]  Let's take a look at that big one again. Yeah right below the olympic record
[5906.16s -> 5908.16s]  That line right there. Damn it
[5918.59s -> 5920.59s]  This works strong damn
[5924.03s -> 5926.03s]  Nice work
[5928.91s -> 5931.14s]  Well
[5931.14s -> 5935.86s]  I just I didn't mean to skip it. I pressed x way too early and I skipped it accidentally
[5937.23s -> 5939.23s]  Time for the gold medal and kayaking
[5939.47s -> 5947.74s]  Don't worry, we're gonna hear it right here because i'm gonna get the goddamn gold medal
[5952.19s -> 5954.88s]  All right, come on kevin
[5954.88s -> 5966.78s]  Come on kevin, let's go
[5973.86s -> 5980.58s]  Well, that shows the control of the kayak the way this athlete's leaning leaning very hard to one side here
[5981.30s -> 5983.46s]  Moving nicely through the first time check
[5984.66s -> 5987.38s]  Well, the next gate is against the current it's upstream
[5989.14s -> 5998.03s]  Made hard work of that gate
[5998.43s -> 6006.58s]  Completely and utterly missed that gate. All right, we're good through two sections
[6007.54s -> 6009.54s]  Clean through that last gate
[6009.54s -> 6012.42s]  Well, this is all about timing through the oval
[6014.02s -> 6018.88s]  Come on needs to keep on top of the white water through this upstream gate
[6021.78s -> 6023.78s]  Did well to get through that gate
[6024.18s -> 6035.18s]  There will be some disappointment because this athlete has picked up a few penalties here
[6035.90s -> 6040.22s]  Maybe this athlete can take some consolation out of a good final section
[6040.70s -> 6042.86s]  Needs to improve on the performance so far
[6043.66s -> 6046.70s]  This is the last big drop of the course. It's a big bet
[6047.26s -> 6051.58s]  Well, it took an awful lot of hard working effort, but eventually got through that. Yeah, that's a finish
[6054.03s -> 6056.03s]  That's gotta be decent
[6058.25s -> 6064.33s]  9199
[6064.43s -> 6071.33s]  Well, it's a good start to this one very very smooth going down the road
[6072.91s -> 6075.09s]  Negotiating some of the hazards very well here
[6076.77s -> 6079.25s]  Looks good looks very good at this stage
[6080.82s -> 6084.42s]  Not at all time to paddle powerfully not even close
[6085.46s -> 6087.46s]  This is good. What's bad?
[6093.82s -> 6096.46s]  Oh the smoothness is just absolutely smooth
[6097.26s -> 6114.30s]  Any medal is a good medal when you come to the olympic games and the celebrations of this athlete will tell you exactly that
[6114.70s -> 6116.70s]  Oh bronze medal
[6122.48s -> 6124.48s]  What was it? What was your score?
[6125.18s -> 6127.26s]  What was the score? Why didn't see what was the score?
[6133.76s -> 6138.88s]  What was the score I want to I want to see the score I want to see the actual score
[6139.52s -> 6144.82s]  What brings to a close another fantastic day of competition here at the lee valley whitewater center
[6145.06s -> 6147.96s]  I hope you've enjoyed it as much as me from seth bennett
[6153.63s -> 6155.07s]  God damn it
[6155.07s -> 6158.56s]  I wanted to see how much time they had against me
[6159.28s -> 6163.46s]  Let's take a look here. We got
[6163.46s -> 6165.54s]  The united states china's got two gold medals now
[6167.26s -> 6169.39s]  two bronze medals
[6169.39s -> 6179.57s]  Bronze are gonna mad up in the end
[6179.57s -> 6182.19s]  100 women's skeet
[6184.40s -> 6186.00s]  And i'm gonna do the breaststroke
[6186.00s -> 6193.87s]  This is definitely just tap as fast as possible
[6194.35s -> 6195.95s]  But no way it's not
[6195.95s -> 6207.14s]  That's all you need to know
[6213.15s -> 6215.55s]  I don't know why I was like looking at the other monitor over here for a second
[6215.55s -> 6219.23s]  I thought they were all naked like actual just completely butt naked. I was like what the hell
[6220.03s -> 6222.03s]  And then all right. Yeah, they're with a little underwear
[6222.51s -> 6231.18s]  How does this work?
[6231.18s -> 6232.22s]  go
[6232.22s -> 6234.72s]  die
[6234.80s -> 6236.80s]  Tap x repeatedly while underwater
[6239.71s -> 6241.39s]  Hold down to swim
[6241.39s -> 6272.21s]  Square press the correct button the final boost press x at the end of the race to lunge for the wall
[6273.62s -> 6277.22s]  Time each stroke to when both arms are fully extended to build the most speed
[6281.36s -> 6283.36s]  All right
[6283.76s -> 6285.76s]  Go lance
[6289.20s -> 6294.80s]  Press x a knowledgeable push descends. No, what if you lunge hard and slam into the wall?
[6296.64s -> 6303.62s]  What oh
[6318.62s -> 6320.62s]  Focus there's the l and r up here
[6362.82s -> 6366.34s]  This just reminds me of those old shows where you know talk about the
[6366.66s -> 6368.90s]  You got the hot dog eating contest the guy with the bear
[6369.54s -> 6371.92s]  This is like this is like the man versus the otter
[6373.34s -> 6377.98s]  And we make sure we give the otter. Well, let's take a final look five seconds before
[6379.02s -> 6383.66s]  I got five second head start on the otter. I was the otter out of the olympic games in this event
[6383.90s -> 6385.90s]  Not good. I'm afraid for team usa
[6396.32s -> 6401.28s]  Bears shouldn't eat hot dogs. No, they really shouldn't tell that to like late 90s television
[6402.64s -> 6404.64s]  They thought they sure thought it was real funny
[6405.60s -> 6419.65s]  All right, i'm gonna do this well
[6419.65s -> 6422.18s]  Oh shit
[6422.18s -> 6423.94s]  I'm gonna do so well here
[6423.94s -> 6430.94s]  The reticule will shrink when the targeting to hit track the targets move before shooting for the best result
[6430.94s -> 6432.94s]  I'll always shoot the yellow target first
[6433.58s -> 6445.26s]  Okay petition these athletes equally match not much between them
[6448.70s -> 6451.66s]  Well, here we are on station one first up the single
[6457.41s -> 6461.06s]  Almost blew that one
[6461.54s -> 6471.89s]  Here comes a double let's have a look on the double whatever
[6472.13s -> 6481.01s]  Locked in the shooting. Come on. I gotta do this. Well only one
[6485.12s -> 6488.26s]  Fuck I missed out with that last shot
[6491.34s -> 6498.96s]  Looking for the double hit
[6499.04s -> 6502.24s]  That's tricky
[6508.80s -> 6514.46s]  Just a single right what happened it
[6516.80s -> 6521.44s]  Just didn't react fast enough to that first target I think it's the r2 is messed up. I really mean that
[6522.24s -> 6534.08s]  It's a good round and there's no doubt now
[6534.16s -> 6538.24s]  That this competitor can have the confidence that they can keep up with the leaders here
[6539.36s -> 6545.01s]  I feel like that's a weird way to hold a gun. It's like let it rest on your shoulder
[6548.67s -> 6554.26s]  Ah, it's a bit disappointing that's open like that from the high house
[6556.11s -> 6562.43s]  Well station number four asks a lot of the shooters first a high single then a low single followed by
[6565.63s -> 6568.35s]  That's how you hold a rifle you have it like open like that over your shoulder
[6572.83s -> 6583.41s]  Yeah, I can't say i've ever held a rifle before in my life, but what the hell did I know this is the double
[6584.05s -> 6596.98s]  I think I got the hang of it
[6600.02s -> 6612.82s]  Just got to wait stay in the middle and see where it goes two more targets still to hit
[6613.86s -> 6617.70s]  It came out fast very fast
[6621.81s -> 6623.81s]  You're saying hog
[6632.82s -> 6644.66s]  There's another one
[6645.62s -> 6656.18s]  First close i'll give it to you
[6658.42s -> 6661.62s]  If you close your eyes block your ears and yell really loud I guess it's pretty close
[6663.30s -> 6681.58s]  The person in last place only hit one target did they
[6682.30s -> 6689.60s]  Yeah, they did
[6689.60s -> 6691.60s]  What's the excuse there? Do you think?
[6694.24s -> 6698.24s]  I think the next day you fake an illness right the next day after the olympics you go like god turns out
[6698.32s -> 6700.88s]  Yeah, I got I had like fucking wicked bad diarrhea
[6702.53s -> 6705.81s]  Yeah, I was like I had like I was like wicked fucking sick with diarrhea and shit
[6706.45s -> 6712.91s]  Like this that's that's what I would do like I tried my best right?
[6713.47s -> 6718.85s]  But I mean I was feeling terrible
[6732.82s -> 6736.42s]  If you say wicked again, I will sub for real that'd be wicked cool if you did
[6736.90s -> 6739.46s]  And i'll stop station number eight
[6740.18s -> 6742.18s]  Nope
[6751.38s -> 6763.08s]  All right now let's make it really happen give a solution to any social issue just saying he has diarrhea
[6763.30s -> 6765.38s]  That's an incredibly easy to understand thing
[6766.34s -> 6769.02s]  There's no nuance there. It's just
[6769.82s -> 6771.82s]  I have diarrhea
[6772.94s -> 6778.54s]  You don't have to explain that you don't have to tell anybody anything. It is no beginning. There's no middle. There's no end. There's only
[6779.58s -> 6781.95s]  Diarrhea everybody understands it
[6784.30s -> 6786.38s]  And it's a thing that nobody wants to question either
[6786.86s -> 6803.86s]  First up station number one, although be careful using it that often next up. It's the double high house first
[6804.58s -> 6810.19s]  Oh, I thought I missed it
[6818.38s -> 6830.03s]  That's good, I like it
[6830.03s -> 6831.55s]  Or if you hit one, you know
[6831.55s -> 6834.59s]  I mean if back in the day when there wasn't really any cameras here
[6834.91s -> 6841.34s]  I would just say I tried to do with my eyes closed. Oh, all right. Damn. Holy shit. Yeah, I tried
[6842.06s -> 6844.62s]  I got one that's impressive
[6855.14s -> 6863.65s]  Put him on the screen
[6864.05s -> 6869.57s]  Putting the pressure on at the top of the scoreboard, but there are two or three others that are very close by
[6870.40s -> 6872.70s]  Yeah, this uh
[6872.70s -> 6875.07s]  Anna and it's really close
[6883.81s -> 6886.70s]  Oh, I dropped it. Well, that was close
[6890.38s -> 6897.73s]  Station three at the double. All right, we're good. You can miss one. It's okay
[6904.69s -> 6906.69s]  Good execution on that round
[6907.73s -> 6909.17s]  Re three three
[6909.17s -> 6911.17s]  She's been perfect. All right, I gotta be perfect here
[6911.73s -> 6924.02s]  I want that gold medal
[6924.02s -> 6926.18s]  Well, this is a biggie station number four
[6926.82s -> 6929.06s]  six targets in total to aim for
[6929.70s -> 6934.64s]  Take the board down omega lul losing omega lul losing you're losing to norway
[6935.68s -> 6937.68s]  Oh looking for the double on station four
[6943.81s -> 6948.85s]  I'm gonna don't i'm gonna delete those channel points if you keep using them
[6949.97s -> 6961.07s]  This is the double don't do it. Have you guys even seen the new emotes yet?
[6961.71s -> 6967.68s]  This place at the midway point for team usa and things definitely going to plan
[6968.70s -> 6978.10s]  Can we see the new emotes please? I want to do the diving competition
[6978.80s -> 6982.26s]  I feel like I would be really good at that one. What can she do on this double?
[6983.06s -> 6993.26s]  That was good. That was clean
[6993.26s -> 6995.90s]  I I really I ran away with it here 17 to 13
[6996.54s -> 7002.67s]  I can relax
[7002.67s -> 7006.00s]  Yeah, it's all right. I can miss
[7006.72s -> 7012.40s]  German punching or why are you doing the punching shit? This is the double low house first
[7021.41s -> 7023.84s]  This looks like a lot of fun
[7023.84s -> 7030.16s]  It's the end of the round now on the scoreboard has a really but is it weird that I don't want a rifle
[7030.24s -> 7032.24s]  I want a plate shooter
[7033.23s -> 7036.03s]  I want to shoot the clay plates with clay plates
[7047.39s -> 7049.39s]  Like tribes. Yeah
[7049.47s -> 7052.35s]  I just I want to try to play this shooter gun
[7053.23s -> 7058.43s]  Try to hit the other that'd be awesome. Well, it's been a good performance for the usa. That'd be so hard
[7059.23s -> 7062.91s]  And this is a shotgun. Yeah, but I I don't I want a plate gun
[7073.14s -> 7075.86s]  Somebody that knows explain it to me. I thought shotguns were
[7076.90s -> 7078.90s]  really low range
[7078.90s -> 7085.86s]  There are two targets here on offer that can be hit. Will it be enough though to win a medal? This is station number eight
[7087.74s -> 7091.02s]  It's just a big spread don't they just the pellets all spread out like all over the place
[7091.10s -> 7093.10s]  I guess that's kind of the point
[7095.57s -> 7097.57s]  That's just video game logic
[7099.82s -> 7101.34s]  Really?
[7101.34s -> 7105.98s]  I thought that you shot like this like
[7106.86s -> 7108.86s]  Bird shot
[7111.34s -> 7113.58s]  It blows up out of the gun and it just goes
[7114.62s -> 7119.17s]  Oh, that's cool. It's called bird shop because they shoot birds in the air
[7119.97s -> 7124.16s]  How can I live in america and not know anything about guns?
[7129.06s -> 7131.06s]  I don't know. I don't I don't like use them
[7138.43s -> 7140.67s]  Just because just because you're in america doesn't mean that
[7142.35s -> 7144.35s]  I have like four shotguns
[7144.91s -> 7151.31s]  And these moments will be captured and will be on the front pages of the papers in the morning I got six gold
[7152.19s -> 7154.19s]  terrific performance
[7156.78s -> 7158.78s]  I've kicked a gun before
[7160.74s -> 7162.74s]  That seems like a bad idea
[7162.74s -> 7168.98s]  I'm, not sure that's smart. We got high jump
[7171.98s -> 7175.74s]  Table tennis. Oh, yeah, this is gonna be great. I can't wait
[7176.62s -> 7189.15s]  And it's really high jump. How does high jump work? You just jump as high as you can somebody measures it
[7189.87s -> 7192.51s]  I don't think i've ever seen this
[7192.51s -> 7196.43s]  Wait, is this thing where they jump they arch their back and they like slime their legs around the bar
[7197.31s -> 7199.31s]  This thing's insane if this is what I think it is
[7201.87s -> 7205.14s]  Yep, this is yep. This is it
[7205.14s -> 7206.26s]  Fill the bar
[7206.26s -> 7216.06s]  Those these ones are so hard to do flick when the athlete reaches the white marker
[7216.70s -> 7220.34s]  Press x to kick your legs and avoid the bar
[7224.24s -> 7227.18s]  60 degrees is perfect jump
[7227.18s -> 7235.63s]  Right
[7246.66s -> 7254.00s]  Nobody can jump over that nobody can jump over this. This is like 15 feet high. How big is this?
[7284.29s -> 7286.29s]  Who the fuck was able to do that
[7286.93s -> 7299.97s]  Having under the bar only gets you onto the outtakes of this olympic games
[7302.82s -> 7304.90s]  Here's the replay
[7304.90s -> 7308.82s]  Well, here we go attempt number three looking for better things. I can't lower it
[7318.74s -> 7324.05s]  What the fuck?
[7324.05s -> 7330.16s]  Welcome huge disappointment for team usa
[7333.23s -> 7340.91s]  This is the olympic stadium welcome one of the most sustainable ever built the low ball is set into the existing landscape
[7341.07s -> 7343.07s]  Well, wait, the world record is 209
[7344.90s -> 7349.94s]  Why did I think I could jump over 2.6 if the world record?
[7350.50s -> 7352.50s]  Is 209
[7356.58s -> 7358.74s]  Why are you even allowed to put it this high?
[7366.74s -> 7369.14s]  You got to be kidding me. All right, i'm coming down
[7370.35s -> 7376.16s]  to
[7376.16s -> 7380.00s]  171 80
[7388.14s -> 7390.14s]  There it is
[7398.30s -> 7402.94s]  That was close I could have gone a little higher which country you want to win the gold medal in this event
[7403.34s -> 7407.58s]  You've got to respect the stuff that athletes made to this competition 190. Let's go
[7408.86s -> 7411.50s]  Is this the poker event in the olympics? Let's go
[7418.66s -> 7426.85s]  Oh, I got it
[7428.05s -> 7430.05s]  I'm going i'm going for 210
[7435.14s -> 7441.70s]  First place a stunning start to this competition really laying down the benchmark for everyone else to follow
[7447.71s -> 7460.88s]  Oh shit, what happened? I didn't even see a replay
[7481.90s -> 7484.14s]  Nice approach why can I not lower it?
[7509.46s -> 7513.70s]  After three rounds not they're not gonna give me any fanfare for that. I just beat the I just did the world record
[7514.10s -> 7528.45s]  I can't lower it. Wait, once I beat the world record everyone's like no, no, no, no, you gotta go higher
[7529.01s -> 7534.08s]  No one's gonna be able to do this
[7534.08s -> 7539.92s]  Anybody else has street of this sport until five minutes ago record attempt
[7544.70s -> 7552.32s]  Is a good take we gotta go higher than that. Come on man
[7563.18s -> 7565.74s]  A stutter in the run-up will have cost this athlete
[7566.70s -> 7571.14s]  No chance of going clear when you hit the bar that hard
[7571.78s -> 7577.41s]  This is a limbo, you know, you have to go over rather than under the bar
[7578.05s -> 7582.21s]  Here's the replay. I just imagine like
[7583.09s -> 7585.09s]  You head off the side of the bar
[7587.17s -> 7589.65s]  Again, this is world record in the qualifiers, right?
[7590.69s -> 7594.06s]  I didn't win anything
[7594.06s -> 7604.29s]  All right, as long as I continuously clear two
[7605.78s -> 7607.78s]  I'm gonna start at one
[7607.86s -> 7619.73s]  They've moved on nicely through to the olympic tennis event i'm intrigued by this one
[7620.45s -> 7629.06s]  This is the excel london and next up the semi-finals of the men's table tennis
[7631.47s -> 7635.15s]  I love ping pong. It's I love it. I'm terrible at it
[7636.11s -> 7643.31s]  I consider going back and forth three times a victory before somebody goes. Oh too hard goes into the ceiling
[7643.31s -> 7645.31s]  Whoops, just get it again, man. We'll do it again
[7646.05s -> 7649.94s]  Going one two three. Oh, that was fun. I don't know how people do it that hard
[7649.94s -> 7651.94s]  I don't know if the star does this shit
[7652.10s -> 7656.67s]  Just like the didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't I can't even I can't see that fast
[7656.83s -> 7659.97s]  I can't even see that fast. It's impossible
[7660.45s -> 7664.42s]  Push it for a straight top spin
[7664.58s -> 7670.66s]  Aim to the left. So it's just timing
[7672.45s -> 7673.97s]  Aim to the right
[7673.97s -> 7676.19s]  It's for backspin
[7676.19s -> 7689.70s]  Oh, you can move press r quickly rotate towards r to add right spin
[7690.50s -> 7699.87s]  Okay, I need to read seven points with a two-point lead
[7706.80s -> 7719.36s]  Usa versus france peter ko. Oh peter ko. Okay, I made this name for a second
[7725.55s -> 7736.80s]  It's a great reception here for our two competitors slows the rally down with a side spin
[7741.55s -> 7743.55s]  Oh what happened
[7752.80s -> 7761.04s]  Come on this is so awkward. Okay
[7770.69s -> 7772.85s]  Starting to build
[7772.85s -> 7774.85s]  Fantastic backhand I get it
[7775.09s -> 7777.33s]  Hit the corner of the table. They hit the corner of the table. I got the corner
[7777.89s -> 7795.36s]  Let's be taking a battering. It's another point lost. This is the resident evil tank controls
[7796.16s -> 7799.10s]  They're like killing me
[7799.10s -> 7817.34s]  It's right across the table with a forehand. Just don't get yourself into trouble got a one by two. Remember that's important to remember
[7824.90s -> 7835.90s]  So the rally's starting to take shape
[7835.90s -> 7841.74s]  Fantastic rally kept alive. Why are we both treating this like it's a bug flying around the room you're getting away from me
[7843.02s -> 7859.39s]  Shit by my face
[7859.39s -> 7861.39s]  Yeah, we're paying 10. Got him
[7865.28s -> 7870.88s]  Does anybody else feel like the table should be raised like a full foot we're really hunching down here
[7882.32s -> 7884.32s]  beautifully on the backhand side
[7885.31s -> 7891.87s]  Places the ball with the backhand. Oh, did you see that curve to win the point at this?
[7892.67s -> 7896.13s]  Wait, how did I get that correct?
[7898.40s -> 7918.70s]  Oh, yes, oh did he get it on the edge you mother fucker. No, we did not
[7928.10s -> 7930.53s]  Help he cannot you gotta win by two points
[7932.61s -> 7934.61s]  Oh shit the camera thing
[7935.34s -> 7945.55s]  Fuck i'm sorry
[7945.55s -> 7947.55s]  So the rally really starting to take shape
[7963.94s -> 7967.78s]  But he really needs to focus now. Here we go with the first serve of the second game
[7969.81s -> 7973.65s]  All right, let's say all right this i'm talking about look at how high the guy on the right's chair is
[7974.35s -> 7979.07s]  Why don't they just put a couple of books underneath the table to make it be like four or five inches higher
[7979.07s -> 7982.78s]  We're all like leaning down here. Is it why does it have to be this low?
[8002.86s -> 8004.86s]  That's not good
[8007.50s -> 8011.58s]  Yeah, I yeah, I know I said it first that means I I can say it's fine I can say it first
[8022.64s -> 8024.64s]  Why am I acting like this
[8029.31s -> 8031.47s]  Look at the way that i'm volleying this back and forth
[8033.09s -> 8035.33s]  I don't get it. So i'm trying
[8038.00s -> 8042.08s]  It's too weird. It's too weird. It's fucking weird. It's weird. All right, it's weird
[8046.90s -> 8048.34s]  Yeah, let me explain this
[8048.34s -> 8053.17s]  Okay, imagine this is a gta 5 mini game that you can pull up to right?
[8053.25s -> 8058.16s]  That's how this feels like to play it feels like this is a gta 5 game. You know, let's put golf in
[8058.24s -> 8061.52s]  Let's put like this in yeah, this was this was like, yep. Yep. Yep
[8062.08s -> 8068.85s]  Take all blame away from me
[8074.88s -> 8086.46s]  And this is where we come back
[8086.46s -> 8095.15s]  What a shame he's trailing here and the difference between the two players is getting bigger
[8100.03s -> 8104.43s]  How do you miss that why are you just like swatting at it for some answers?
[8107.22s -> 8112.02s]  Why that was so just violent and just incorrect the serve is crucial
[8112.66s -> 8121.98s]  Pressure on they take the point. Where can they go from here point now? Can they get that place moved back?
[8122.54s -> 8142.43s]  The olympic action from here for the moment seth benet will now wrap up the results
[8143.87s -> 8147.49s]  You only get so many world records for the day, okay
[8156.30s -> 8158.10s]  Okay
[8158.10s -> 8160.82s]  We need I have the I currently have the world record
[8164.18s -> 8168.10s]  My world it's 210. Why does nobody care that the record's 210?
[8168.66s -> 8170.66s]  We're starting at one nine. We're starting at two
[8171.30s -> 8182.61s]  Looking for a solid effort here and go no one's ever gonna do that. I'm the only one on earth that can do that
[8188.24s -> 8190.67s]  Now I have
[8190.83s -> 8192.54s]  at least
[8192.54s -> 8195.66s]  Four or five attempts to break my world record
[8203.68s -> 8208.78s]  This is the current record while this bar is getting ever so high now
[8210.26s -> 8215.14s]  This would require a great lead you stupid asshole to get this world record
[8217.06s -> 8220.66s]  I have the world record. What do you mean get the world record? I currently have it
[8229.39s -> 8231.39s]  Yeah
[8238.72s -> 8240.72s]  The heel
[8240.96s -> 8271.46s]  Who cares kicking any point at the world record I got the world record last time why nobody care about this
[8311.57s -> 8316.37s]  All right, I got seven medals i'm doing very good men's table tennis
[8316.69s -> 8317.89s]  I
[8317.89s -> 8321.58s]  Am I in the finals for the men's table tennis? I just got beat
[8322.76s -> 8324.76s]  absolutely horrible
[8325.18s -> 8326.94s]  Why am I in the final?
[8326.94s -> 8328.94s]  I still qualified
[8340.45s -> 8342.45s]  I'm done
[8342.69s -> 8348.05s]  Why did I qualify well take advantage of it take advantage just like the fucked up rules just let's try to win
[8350.70s -> 8352.70s]  Take that it shouldn't be it should be legal
[8353.98s -> 8371.10s]  Shouldn't like the white should not it shouldn't be painted white. I don't know to keep the rally going
[8373.92s -> 8376.24s]  Wow, that backhand what a joy to watch
[8378.10s -> 8380.98s]  It's a real mess of that back. All right, that was like a wiffle ball
[8382.35s -> 8384.35s]  Forehand back across the net
[8384.59s -> 8386.90s]  Backhand will test his opponent
[8387.54s -> 8391.36s]  Oh, he's gonna be disappointed with that forehand
[8392.61s -> 8396.61s]  He seemed a long way out of position there. There was just no way he was gonna return it
[8396.61s -> 8399.30s]  It
[8400.34s -> 8410.72s]  A little shimmy. Oh, okay rally starting to build
[8411.68s -> 8413.68s]  It's the forehand back over the net
[8414.91s -> 8416.91s]  Forehand keeps the rally. Yeah
[8427.34s -> 8432.30s]  Damn it. Well, his opponent was just simply too good for him there and he'll lose the point
[8435.90s -> 8439.98s]  There we go. All right, I got I can I can beat this enjoying it as much as the crowd are
[8440.38s -> 8442.70s]  But he will take the confidence from that point
[8450.54s -> 8452.54s]  Nope, nope, nope, it's tagging
[8453.10s -> 8456.46s]  First x for a special. I don't think I have spent one. It's not real
[8457.42s -> 8468.50s]  Starting to get into the game as the rally starts building there is definitely no argument there at all
[8468.74s -> 8471.14s]  He wins the point with that fantastic play
[8472.02s -> 8475.34s]  I don't know why I keep going for but you have to
[8475.66s -> 8484.46s]  This rally really starting to take shape now
[8485.26s -> 8489.02s]  Using his backhand spike it a fantastic forehand there
[8492.14s -> 8494.14s]  Loses the point there with that play
[8495.57s -> 8498.29s]  Oh the stupid plastic ball in on the other idiot's side
[8498.85s -> 8500.85s]  Good job. What are you saying?
[8504.80s -> 8520.75s]  Wait, is this just like a complete just you just tearing ping pong apart. Yeah spike it plays the forehand there
[8521.70s -> 8523.70s]  Forehand keeps the game in play
[8523.70s -> 8526.38s]  I'll be disappointed with that forehand
[8527.50s -> 8529.02s]  All right spike it
[8529.02s -> 8547.82s]  I need one more point and I win and he start to really build a significant lead now got it. Yes
[8551.04s -> 8554.24s]  Wait, is this just going to be a straight how many games do I have to play?
[8555.20s -> 8558.72s]  How many games of table tennis do I have to play?
[8564.93s -> 8570.13s]  That's the three but it but who is this are we the two best in the world or is this just for like seventh place?
[8570.61s -> 8578.99s]  How does this work looking to force the errors? Is this for bronze?
[8579.87s -> 8589.58s]  I'll get it
[8589.58s -> 8594.62s]  This rally really starting to take shape now. There it is. Good. He's got to be pleased with that the point is
[8595.58s -> 8598.86s]  Does this look like the work of the best in the world? No, it does not
[8599.34s -> 8607.20s]  I did really well there to force his opponent sara. He'll take the point with that
[8607.92s -> 8613.54s]  Can I take the bronze medal and then just say i'm done?
[8614.10s -> 8618.58s]  I don't even want the gold one. You just gives this. I don't even want to attempt. It's gonna go in the stands into play
[8619.86s -> 8622.42s]  Asking the questions with a backhand
[8622.82s -> 8631.68s]  What an incredible rally the crowd are really loving this to see he wins the point there with some fantastic approach play
[8635.41s -> 8636.77s]  That was awesome
[8636.77s -> 8639.89s]  How did I do that with my backhand? I did it with the other side of the panel
[8641.25s -> 8653.46s]  I really is starting to play to the crowd now and they are responding. What a fantastic point one
[8657.74s -> 8658.86s]  Ah
[8658.86s -> 8662.38s]  Thought it was going out of bounds. He just couldn't return it successfully
[8671.26s -> 8673.50s]  No speed lost on the ball there with the backhand
[8674.38s -> 8680.77s]  What a fantastic point here we go then serving for that. This is it. Can he take it? I will take it
[8681.65s -> 8685.92s]  I didn't get to the head
[8685.92s -> 8689.31s]  And he'll lose that point
[8689.31s -> 8691.31s]  This is waving to somebody in the crowd. What was that?
[8696.00s -> 8698.00s]  So the rally really starting to take shape
[8700.24s -> 8702.96s]  Really can't afford to lose any focus now with this rally
[8703.76s -> 8706.72s]  This is the point going to come from in this rally
[8707.68s -> 8709.68s]  What about this is the point of all of this?
[8715.22s -> 8726.32s]  Shit come on i'm starting to get into the game as the rally starts building
[8727.12s -> 8729.76s]  Both players really matching each other now with this rally
[8730.40s -> 8733.86s]  Give me that bronze
[8733.86s -> 8735.54s]  Give me the bronze
[8735.54s -> 8739.95s]  Give me the bronze
[8755.74s -> 8757.74s]  Is it
[8759.47s -> 8761.95s]  I came in first I came in third place
[8767.07s -> 8769.07s]  Bronze medal
[8769.47s -> 8777.79s]  Appreciate how hard they've worked. I'm just realizing the name of the stream is called silver medals and I don't have any
[8779.55s -> 8782.85s]  I have three bronze medals like six gold medals
[8784.03s -> 8791.39s]  Well, this place is rocking
[8791.63s -> 8793.63s]  And quite rightly so
[8794.13s -> 8797.09s]  The sheer joy and ecstasy on his face
[8797.65s -> 8800.77s]  Tells you everything you need to know about how much winning
[8803.46s -> 8805.22s]  All right, let's go
[8805.22s -> 8807.22s]  Let's take a look at the tallies here
[8808.05s -> 8809.25s]  China
[8809.25s -> 8811.25s]  18 the dude getting a lot of silvers
[8811.89s -> 8823.41s]  I gotta start to be ready here
[8823.41s -> 8826.27s]  women's
[8826.27s -> 8828.93s]  springboard
[8828.93s -> 8831.01s]  men's 100 men's 400
[8832.90s -> 8834.66s]  no, uh
[8834.66s -> 8835.86s]  butterfly
[8835.86s -> 8839.62s]  100 100 sprint. Yeah, we'll do the 100 sprint and this is the diving. I can't wait
[8850.78s -> 8853.90s]  You own two of the 23 possible world records
[8859.82s -> 8861.82s]  I'm ready
[8861.98s -> 8865.28s]  I want to do the high this is not the high dive though, is it? No
[8865.68s -> 8870.38s]  I'm in three meters springboard. Here comes gold medal gwen. We gotta get the gold medal
[8871.34s -> 8875.89s]  That's x to begin the dive
[8875.97s -> 8885.52s]  Let's circle to enter a tough somersault
[8887.87s -> 8889.23s]  And then hit it again
[8889.23s -> 8891.36s]  Then hit down
[8891.36s -> 8894.18s]  I wish eleanor to rotate the athlete
[8894.50s -> 8898.85s]  To get the perfect splash
[8900.14s -> 8908.14s]  Okay
[8912.46s -> 8914.46s]  Yeah, it's all about the splash
[8917.33s -> 8918.77s]  We're square down
[8918.77s -> 8921.41s]  Well, this is quite hard not the most difficult
[8922.21s -> 8933.94s]  I help but wonder whether this diver has been affected by nerves. It is always a big thing to compete in olympic games
[8935.71s -> 8939.87s]  Almost a full-on belly flop. Take a look at the replay, but i'm sure the diver won't want to
[8940.75s -> 8950.30s]  They know just how badly wrong they got it low marks difficulty taken out of the equation because of the incorrect dive
[8954.74s -> 8956.74s]  All right, we're gonna do
[8958.82s -> 8966.69s]  Oh shit, okay square is it square immediately needs to compose herself. What the fuck is going on?
[8967.41s -> 8980.30s]  That one quickly get it straight out of her mind and move on
[8981.86s -> 8983.86s]  It hurts so bad
[8984.02s -> 8985.86s]  Here's the replay
[8985.86s -> 8987.86s]  The twist was good. But after that
[8988.98s -> 8996.18s]  Everything else just went wrong a massive splash of water and that's one of the telltale signs that the dive didn't quite go to
[8996.18s -> 8998.18s]  Japan
[9000.82s -> 9002.82s]  You would be feeling that for months
[9003.70s -> 9005.70s]  Okay, let me try this one more time
[9005.78s -> 9007.78s]  We're just gonna do the easy one
[9008.18s -> 9011.18s]  I have to qualify
[9011.18s -> 9018.86s]  circle down
[9031.20s -> 9033.20s]  I don't i'm not
[9036.40s -> 9038.29s]  Look
[9038.29s -> 9043.49s]  There's no way i'm gonna have enough to qualify. This has got to be fucking incredible. Here we go
[9045.01s -> 9049.35s]  Square square. Well, this is quite risky one of the tougher dives in the competition
[9052.43s -> 9060.75s]  Oh, yeah, i'm screaming
[9065.62s -> 9067.62s]  No splash that's gonna be tens
[9077.09s -> 9079.17s]  All right, do another really difficult one
[9081.01s -> 9082.29s]  Here we go
[9082.29s -> 9084.29s]  This thing is impossible
[9094.43s -> 9097.87s]  A few errors in there and there will be points that are lost here
[9100.99s -> 9105.15s]  It's so funny. It's not even that funny, but it just is for some reason i'm trying
[9110.40s -> 9116.13s]  Okay, wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute that was fucking awesome
[9118.61s -> 9120.90s]  That was incredible
[9120.90s -> 9123.80s]  I don't get extra points for doing something a human can't do
[9130.94s -> 9131.98s]  Okay
[9131.98s -> 9133.98s]  These are the final standings
[9134.14s -> 9139.98s]  It's an unlikely defeat for team usa. I'm sure the athlete will be extremely disappointed with the performance
[9141.26s -> 9143.12s]  Well
[9143.12s -> 9146.40s]  No, I can't retry. I can't I gotta tag swallow the loss
[9148.88s -> 9152.42s]  Those retries are for Olympic level competition
[9153.38s -> 9162.07s]  The old metal gwen doesn't qualify. Oh, you're gonna have to go get that name changed
[9166.84s -> 9177.59s]  So this is just run as fast as you can yeah, I think yeah, I did this already
[9188.16s -> 9195.72s]  Yep, I'll I got this
[9195.72s -> 9205.83s]  What do you think should I do a two three second head start five second head start be a total asshole?
[9206.69s -> 9209.41s]  These athletes are so close in their ability
[9210.68s -> 9215.60s]  run backwards
[9217.20s -> 9220.64s]  Try and get an early win in this I see later you fucking toads
[9221.44s -> 9237.49s]  Wait, doesn't doping dan already have the gold medal in the 100
[9238.45s -> 9240.45s]  Are we doing this again?
[9241.73s -> 9249.65s]  Does everything so well here look so smooth quickly into stride and then it's a case of 200. Oh
[9252.50s -> 9254.50s]  Nobody can even
[9259.14s -> 9261.22s]  I'm gonna go what's the world record i'm going for it
[9273.64s -> 9275.64s]  nine point two six
[9276.36s -> 9278.98s]  nine point five
[9278.98s -> 9280.98s]  Nine point five eight
[9281.70s -> 9283.70s]  Let's get it right now
[9285.06s -> 9288.58s]  Nine point five eight whole of these games are we gonna see a world record?
[9289.62s -> 9296.40s]  Yep, you are
[9296.96s -> 9299.36s]  Who still wants it with 50 meters to go
[9319.35s -> 9323.85s]  And this really has been bought to life the jewel of the olympic crown
[9324.81s -> 9330.71s]  These are out of their blocks in the 100 meters final
[9348.04s -> 9351.72s]  No lunging just run just forest gump style running forward
[9353.48s -> 9355.48s]  Just don't even stop just keep going
[9355.64s -> 9366.28s]  Let's have another look at this then a brilliant performance from start to finish just look great
[9366.60s -> 9368.60s]  Through every phase of this race
[9368.68s -> 9376.04s]  So strong with every stride and then when it came down to winning it made sure that he was high schoolers have better personal best
[9377.48s -> 9384.84s]  And 9.94 the world record is 9.58. You say me tell me high school track and field goes to france with a hard
[9385.16s -> 9391.75s]  Competers are the world records all the way. I just based this on myself
[9392.31s -> 9395.03s]  I did the mile in 16 minutes
[9395.75s -> 9404.01s]  And I just kind of walked back in high school when they timed it
[9405.74s -> 9407.98s]  I think I actually one year. I really did try
[9409.03s -> 9412.42s]  I really got ready for it
[9412.42s -> 9416.90s]  Oh, I got put like in a wheelchair and like threw up behind a tree. I remember this have I told the story
[9421.22s -> 9423.22s]  I did the
[9423.22s -> 9425.46s]  You remember when you high school used to kind of track?
[9426.68s -> 9428.12s]  They did like the
[9428.12s -> 9430.12s]  Everybody's school had the different track and field
[9430.76s -> 9434.52s]  It was like a presidential and there were two different tiers of your health
[9435.40s -> 9438.20s]  And it was how far can you reach how many times can you do a pull-up?
[9438.28s -> 9440.28s]  How many push-ups can you do you guys know this?
[9443.78s -> 9448.50s]  Right, so it was during that it was anything under I believe eight minutes the mile
[9449.38s -> 9452.42s]  Anything under eight or nine minutes, I believe was eight was considered really good
[9454.74s -> 9456.90s]  One year, I really truly wanted to do it. Well
[9458.10s -> 9460.58s]  And I got ready every day. I was
[9461.14s -> 9463.78s]  Just trying to eat better and I wanted to try to stay loose
[9464.42s -> 9466.42s]  And if finally the day came that we were going to do it
[9466.82s -> 9468.82s]  And I really gave it my all
[9469.74s -> 9472.94s]  I was running the whole time. I tried to get it under seven minutes
[9473.26s -> 9476.86s]  I believe I got of somewhere around seven minutes the mile
[9478.36s -> 9483.88s]  And then after I was so winded and so fucked up that I I everyone was going back was gym class. Everyone was leaving
[9484.84s -> 9486.84s]  And I was the world started closing in
[9487.86s -> 9491.86s]  I just kind of sat down for a second. There was the bleachers there at the time where my high school was
[9492.42s -> 9494.42s]  just kind of sat and hung out there and the
[9494.66s -> 9496.74s]  Physical education teacher came over
[9496.74s -> 9500.66s]  And she said are you all right? You're doing okay. You're doing all right. I'm just like yeah fine
[9500.66s -> 9501.86s]  I'm fine. I'm fine
[9501.86s -> 9504.50s]  And I ended up getting up a little bit and I ended up puking behind a tree
[9504.66s -> 9505.54s]  I was like, hold on a second
[9505.54s -> 9508.34s]  I put my hand on a tree and I just went behind it and I puked behind it
[9508.90s -> 9510.90s]  And she saw it and she was like, oh shit
[9511.14s -> 9513.14s]  I didn't say shit, but you know, i'm just paraphrasing
[9513.30s -> 9514.26s]  and
[9514.26s -> 9517.86s]  She said where you can you move or can you walk and I had to sit down
[9518.58s -> 9523.06s]  Maybe four or five feet away from where I just threw up with my back against another tree
[9524.02s -> 9527.78s]  And it's just like I I got it I can't I gotta sit here for a few minutes
[9528.34s -> 9530.82s]  So they went and got a wheelchair and put me in the wheelchair
[9531.46s -> 9533.46s]  And she wheeled me through the high school
[9535.51s -> 9538.31s]  And i'm just like i'm fine. I'm fine everybody. I'm all right. I'm okay. I'm okay
[9539.19s -> 9545.13s]  And then finally like I got some water but just going down the hallway like with her pushing me in a wheelchair
[9545.13s -> 9547.13s]  It must have been just so strange to see me doing that
[9547.93s -> 9550.73s]  and then
[9550.73s -> 9552.73s]  I got some water and I went to
[9552.97s -> 9555.45s]  Math class with a little note that just said hey this dude
[9555.69s -> 9560.41s]  I don't know what it said probably two teachers talking to each other probably just like dude this dude just fucking puked behind a tree
[9562.17s -> 9564.17s]  It's okay that he's like eight minutes late
[9564.57s -> 9569.85s]  Like dash like holy shit talk to you at lunch and they probably talked a lot of they probably talked shit about me and stuff
[9569.85s -> 9571.53s]  I bet they did
[9571.53s -> 9582.95s]  He's got a golden what?
[9582.95s -> 9587.24s]  china
[9587.24s -> 9589.40s]  I got um, it's getting close
[9592.26s -> 9595.30s]  All right, we're gonna do the 400 meter. We're gonna do the 100 meter butterfly
[9611.11s -> 9613.11s]  Wait, we said last time
[9613.27s -> 9618.31s]  You said you did it because that last time you had to run a mile you couldn't because your nutsack was all fucked up
[9618.39s -> 9619.67s]  Yeah, that's true
[9619.67s -> 9623.21s]  That's actually true
[9623.21s -> 9625.21s]  I had I had
[9625.53s -> 9628.65s]  It's true. I did I told you that what did I tell you that?
[9630.09s -> 9632.09s]  I told you guys about like my like
[9632.81s -> 9634.81s]  What did I told you about that?
[9634.81s -> 9640.87s]  I went to the doctor and like I was I was I thought I had they thought they had so I had some called like a
[9641.51s -> 9643.27s]  testic appendix
[9643.27s -> 9645.27s]  And like my balls hurt all the time
[9647.18s -> 9650.86s]  I when did I tell you that did I actually tell i've been around for way too long
[9651.66s -> 9668.95s]  All right. I got this
[9668.95s -> 9677.37s]  It's your doctor. He screams now. He told us well, that'd be really weird if my doctor when I was like 15 was screaming right now
[9685.27s -> 9687.43s]  All right, I gotta really do well
[9688.39s -> 9690.39s]  Do well
[9691.11s -> 9698.41s]  He tried finding other words right onto the line really as now the athletes take to their blocks
[9703.66s -> 9706.62s]  As they emerge from the water, we see the early leaders
[9707.10s -> 9710.54s]  All eight athletes very very close through 25 meters
[9713.83s -> 9716.87s]  And now can they lead from gun to the final touch
[9722.44s -> 9726.76s]  Tumble turn and a strong kick off the wall. I gotta be doing really well here
[9728.44s -> 9760.04s]  The record record olympic record
[9766.60s -> 9768.60s]  I can do better than that
[9773.43s -> 9779.40s]  Who cares guys I have to have something to brag about for the next three months
[9780.20s -> 9785.61s]  I'm going to play the game. They go like 10 gold medals and they did like three four world records
[9787.13s -> 9790.26s]  I need this
[9790.26s -> 9802.66s]  Here we go ready state of the arts 80,000 in capacity and beautiful on the eye
[9809.19s -> 9817.60s]  Is a good performance running strongly approaching the end of the first hundred meters
[9818.32s -> 9829.36s]  This is not even i'm not even winded I just had a bad day i'm thinking about something really sad
[9833.88s -> 9839.00s]  Do I have to finish?
[9839.00s -> 9850.52s]  Am I gonna get past do they have to wait for me to finish?
[9851.60s -> 9875.85s]  I hope so
[9876.01s -> 9878.57s]  I have to go few behind a tree
[9881.93s -> 9883.93s]  Is the ground really hot?
[9883.93s -> 9889.31s]  Am I walking around in bare feet?
[9891.45s -> 9897.07s]  Hey quick somebody get the wheelchair for him. He went way too hard in the first 10 seconds
[9907.24s -> 9909.24s]  It's silent
[9929.66s -> 9936.51s]  Yes
[9936.51s -> 9939.23s]  Watch the replay. I don't know if I want to watch the whole replay
[9939.87s -> 9947.55s]  Why are they playing? What's this music?
[9947.79s -> 9973.69s]  Does that break the game?
[9984.73s -> 9986.73s]  They won't even show me
[9992.40s -> 9997.58s]  It was loading the replay, oh jeez
[10001.47s -> 10004.67s]  I almost want to do that whole thing and not even come off the
[10006.59s -> 10008.59s]  Just don't even start
[10008.67s -> 10011.55s]  And just see how long the timer will count
[10013.85s -> 10017.61s]  Do you think it'll count do you think the game was ever programmed to be like, oh is somebody going to sit here for 10 minutes?
[10017.93s -> 10023.85s]  Has seen periods of dominance for the usa in germany australia. Let's go for the world record double defending champions
[10024.65s -> 10026.33s]  56
[10026.33s -> 10031.05s]  Two lengths and about 50 seconds separates this athlete from olympic glory
[10037.79s -> 10040.43s]  From the water and the early leaders show their heads
[10041.31s -> 10046.19s]  Still some distance to go but at 25 meters the early leaders in control
[10049.47s -> 10052.11s]  Stroke for stroke she's striving for glory
[10056.06s -> 10064.46s]  Strong king in the top usa in second is china in third place canada
[10065.42s -> 10069.39s]  Three quarters of the race come as we enter the closing stages
[10078.69s -> 10088.75s]  World record 56 56
[10090.11s -> 10092.11s]  What is it? Oh
[10097.23s -> 10101.81s]  In this one who was gonna win utter domination from start to finish
[10107.17s -> 10121.38s]  It's one second ahead of that, uh, I got the olympic record already in the qualifier
[10122.02s -> 10141.81s]  Enjoy that nine gold medals
[10143.09s -> 10145.84s]  I think this is the last day
[10146.00s -> 10149.64s]  Did we even see all the events? I don't think we even saw the events
[10150.60s -> 10152.74s]  This is not good
[10152.74s -> 10158.92s]  I've got to this last day. I've got to get two medals or i'm gonna lose first place
[10161.28s -> 10165.84s]  Women's freestyle and women's 100 freestyle. Oh shit. Yeah, I gotta make these good
[10166.72s -> 10179.30s]  China's in second place. I've got to keep it that way
[10180.02s -> 10186.93s]  Well, there's so much at stake here and only a tiny amount of time for these athletes to show exactly what they can do
[10187.01s -> 10191.65s]  Wait, this is just is on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. Let's go. Let's get a qualify
[10191.73s -> 10193.81s]  Look to the middle lanes for the fastest swimmers
[10195.62s -> 10207.96s]  Great start
[10209.64s -> 10211.64s]  I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it
[10212.44s -> 10220.36s]  All right
[10220.36s -> 10223.56s]  I was just doing the thing where you play any game with anybody under the age of five
[10227.33s -> 10229.81s]  You let them win and then you kind of catch up and then you wait I lost
[10230.29s -> 10252.24s]  Braces, this is bad. No china didn't win. Not yet
[10253.84s -> 10255.84s]  Here it comes
[10256.48s -> 10258.48s]  Old medals right now
[10259.78s -> 10261.78s]  Here we go. Then the athletes are ready
[10270.21s -> 10276.45s]  Starting to take shape as we reach the quarter point now starting to stroke well at the quarter point
[10279.46s -> 10281.46s]  Not strong enough here
[10285.30s -> 10296.42s]  What are you doing at the timing on the kick that was required but still just about hanging off in second place
[10300.55s -> 10303.75s]  Start to hurt as we enter the final 25 meters
[10305.83s -> 10330.37s]  The moment for the united states seems to be drowning pretty much did go wrong technique just falling apart
[10331.01s -> 10336.85s]  Breathing patterns nowhere near didn't quite come up to the performance level we expected
[10337.65s -> 10345.59s]  These the final standings though
[10345.99s -> 10351.03s]  Well disappointment for the usa a surprising result as they don't qualify for the final with that
[10361.80s -> 10365.04s]  Yes, we still in first place
[10370.80s -> 10372.87s]  Yes
[10372.87s -> 10375.75s]  We still get why do we get first if we're tied with the same amount of points?
[10385.38s -> 10391.78s]  Continues to burn here at the olympic stadium in london, but it has been a quite terrific games
[10392.10s -> 10399.54s]  The performances have been every bit what you'd expect from the biggest show in the world of sport
[10400.50s -> 10406.66s]  So many iconic landmarks that have just become part and parcel. I want to do the other events. There's a bunch of other events
[10407.22s -> 10413.78s]  Really brought to the table the flags wave in celebration after so many good performances
[10414.42s -> 10416.42s]  Old takes priority
[10418.34s -> 10423.22s]  The nations coming together as one for the last time at the 2012 games
[10425.14s -> 10434.02s]  The city has hosted this magnificently and this closing ceremony really does signify how the whole of the world has come together here
[10434.98s -> 10439.88s]  This is on medium hard has been unlocked
[10449.46s -> 10456.74s]  What is that structure i've seen in the background a bunch of times that what's that what's that structure the heart and soul of these games
[10458.16s -> 10465.20s]  the red one
[10466.61s -> 10468.61s]  That thing right there
[10471.27s -> 10473.51s]  We kept it kept on like showing that from different angles
[10473.59s -> 10477.43s]  And go deep into the london night, I thought that was a roller coaster
[10479.83s -> 10481.11s]  Thank you for joining us
[10481.11s -> 10483.99s]  I was in the distance. I was like, wait, what is that? I thought it was a roller coaster
[10484.79s -> 10487.83s]  Oh, it was like, oh, there's like a park over here. There's like wherever the stadium in london is
[10488.79s -> 10491.40s]  It's not big ben
[10491.40s -> 10497.41s]  All right. Hold on. Let's say events play
[10497.89s -> 10499.49s]  Here we go
[10499.49s -> 10502.40s]  diving
[10502.40s -> 10504.48s]  men's three meter men's 10 meter
[10505.91s -> 10507.91s]  men's synchronized
[10507.91s -> 10509.91s]  What is that? What do you mean synchronized?
[10511.49s -> 10512.53s]  field
[10512.53s -> 10514.53s]  Long jump. We didn't do shot put
[10516.13s -> 10518.13s]  Crack we didn't do hurdles either
[10520.20s -> 10523.52s]  All right. I want to do hurdles
[10523.52s -> 10527.04s]  hurdles
[10527.04s -> 10527.84s]  uh
[10527.84s -> 10529.84s]  Triple jump and shot put yeah
[10535.00s -> 10537.48s]  Let's see. What else do back backstroke?
[10538.04s -> 10540.68s]  I think i'm pretty good at that. Uh, what else is there in here?
[10541.40s -> 10544.85s]  Okay, I want three meter
[10545.44s -> 10548.52s]  10 meter
[10548.52s -> 10550.12s]  three meter
[10550.12s -> 10551.24s]  10 meter
[10551.24s -> 10554.37s]  And then we'll okay. That's what that's okay. Let's go
[10555.01s -> 10557.00s]  on hard
[10557.00s -> 10561.16s]  Pair as individuals or pair up into national teams
[10562.82s -> 10573.30s]  What either two or four players must join?
[10573.86s -> 10578.72s]  Why can I do individual?
[10578.72s -> 10582.16s]  Oh, because it's okay. Okay, right because it's a synchronized
[10582.72s -> 10585.41s]  This is the synchronized shit can't be in here
[10596.00s -> 10601.27s]  Take them off
[10601.27s -> 10603.27s]  Okay, no synchronized
[10603.27s -> 10608.52s]  I'm now what diving that's diving shooting rapid fire ski
[10609.08s -> 10611.08s]  I already did those archery
[10611.24s -> 10615.24s]  All right, you know already did gymnastics men's trampoline men's vault
[10616.74s -> 10619.17s]  other sports
[10619.17s -> 10620.61s]  skulls
[10620.61s -> 10623.62s]  I have no idea what skulls is
[10623.78s -> 10638.24s]  Do weightlifting again? I will
[10638.40s -> 10648.98s]  Let's do these ones first. I already beat the game. I don't have to do it again. We're doing just the extra stuff
[10649.78s -> 10651.78s]  Hurdles, I actually want to do some of my theories
[10655.76s -> 10659.60s]  Okay, so how a doping dan obviously he's got two or three gold medals, so how does this work?
[10660.24s -> 10668.28s]  Okay, press x
[10668.28s -> 10670.28s]  You tap same way you do all the other ones
[10671.24s -> 10673.60s]  Press as you approach the hurdle
[10685.78s -> 10693.54s]  Body bounce off of it. I get it. See if I can beat them all let me say you're gonna play fall guys. Yes
[10694.10s -> 10696.71s]  Just not today
[10696.71s -> 10698.71s]  We'll do that probably next we'll do that probably on monday
[10703.80s -> 10706.44s]  Plan on monday afternoon fall guys
[10712.98s -> 10718.08s]  Well, here we go then a great ovation for all eight athletes, but now so
[10718.88s -> 10723.16s]  Good start to this and that's vital in the field of this standard
[10723.80s -> 10729.68s]  50 meters to go
[10733.52s -> 10735.52s]  This is much harder than it looks
[10745.35s -> 10747.35s]  So much to analyze
[10747.43s -> 10750.15s]  The stride was choppy. It wasn't smooth
[10750.47s -> 10755.91s]  They didn't really get into rhythm and come the final few meters were nowhere really to be seen
[10757.11s -> 10762.23s]  How far he's his legs are just spreading there. What the hell has a cool car. All right, whatever
[10763.43s -> 10765.48s]  Next event
[10765.48s -> 10770.76s]  Usually three steps then jump the timing is half the battle. Yeah, I probably feel like it'd be very difficult
[10771.64s -> 10776.55s]  What's his next one? I don't remember
[10777.11s -> 10783.67s]  Well, the conditions triple jump right for some long distance jumping here. It's the triple. What the hell does this work?
[10784.39s -> 10793.14s]  Mm-hmm. So then you go
[10794.61s -> 10801.80s]  run
[10801.80s -> 10804.84s]  Wait, oh this is oh, this is uh, this is a mario thing you get to go like what?
[10806.20s -> 10809.44s]  Right, I get it
[10824.58s -> 10828.71s]  That wasn't bad gonna call me on fault
[10835.57s -> 10837.75s]  Not terrible not awful
[10840.45s -> 10842.45s]  Yeah, thanks for saying everything I said
[10852.37s -> 10854.37s]  He's too hard
[10865.25s -> 10867.25s]  This meter makes no sense
[10873.62s -> 10876.76s]  Thirdly through this competition
[10887.17s -> 10891.57s]  Needs to do well here, it's all right. I did that was like something
[10909.49s -> 10911.49s]  This is not even it's impossible
[10914.05s -> 10916.85s]  Probably gave away too much distance early on
[10917.81s -> 10923.25s]  The seventh after that round and the scoreboard confirms there's still plenty of work to do early
[10923.89s -> 10926.13s]  Well, this is the final attempt for this athlete
[10933.70s -> 10935.70s]  That's got to be at least worthy of anything
[10936.42s -> 10938.42s]  That's worthy of something
[10938.42s -> 10951.09s]  Thanks a stunning jump
[10953.38s -> 10955.38s]  Not doing so well to start
[10955.78s -> 10968.12s]  That was dumb. I don't want to do that one anymore shot. Now. This is what i'm talking about. I'm ready for this
[10968.68s -> 10978.47s]  This is where I make my money
[10978.47s -> 10983.09s]  rapidly tap x
[10983.09s -> 10991.54s]  Push not throwing straight loses power push up perfect throwing it was 35 degrees
[10992.26s -> 10995.78s]  All right
[10996.58s -> 10998.58s]  Can you fall over
[11018.28s -> 11020.28s]  What happened there
[11025.40s -> 11032.23s]  The leaderboard says it all seven trying to get it just great
[11039.65s -> 11041.65s]  I got four more chances. Come on
[11043.41s -> 11048.37s]  Don't make me laugh don't make me fucking laugh
[11061.36s -> 11063.36s]  All right, I gotta I can't look at chat
[11063.36s -> 11068.66s]  Performance is reflected on the scoreboard with a low showing accordion
[11112.74s -> 11116.34s]  Wait for the angle i'm i'm trying to i'm I know i'm waiting
[11118.90s -> 11128.50s]  When it comes down
[11163.03s -> 11166.01s]  35 right i'll get it
[11172.07s -> 11174.07s]  35 is a perfect angle
[11189.46s -> 11191.46s]  Oh
[11236.96s -> 11238.96s]  It looks like he's on the phone
[11251.99s -> 11255.61s]  Last chance to get world record. I already got the olympic record. I gotta get the world
[11271.27s -> 11282.12s]  To go new olympic record
[11288.28s -> 11295.16s]  See it quick across the circle and then explosive as the shot went flying high into the air
[11296.44s -> 11298.60s]  Great how much of those little shot putt balls away?
[11299.48s -> 11304.37s]  On final check on the standings then what an event this has been have to be really heavy
[11306.21s -> 11308.21s]  They're 16 pounds
[11310.96s -> 11312.88s]  Wow
[11312.88s -> 11314.32s]  That's dense
[11314.32s -> 11322.26s]  That's insane. There's plenty of tension in our 100 meter backstroke
[11331.03s -> 11333.93s]  Well, here we go this athlete's one of the favorites in this competition
[11335.19s -> 11337.19s]  You start in the water
[11342.64s -> 11348.64s]  Into the stroke now as they emerge from the water pulling hard through the water at 25 meters
[11351.68s -> 11355.04s]  So nearly halfway and it could be better for this athlete
[11356.40s -> 11368.23s]  That's a strong push as the athletes come towards the surface. It's very close at the front
[11368.87s -> 11370.47s]  in first place
[11370.47s -> 11372.47s]  come on
[11396.82s -> 11407.00s]  I didn't choke. It was I got to the end. I realized I was in third fourth place and I just gave up here
[11407.00s -> 11415.19s]  We go finally we get to see me the real me
[11430.24s -> 11433.28s]  I was wrong will the big splash on entry have cost him dearly
[11434.32s -> 11437.92s]  The entry was poor. Let's take a look at the replay. He's dead
[11438.64s -> 11440.64s]  Good elevation nice tuck
[11441.36s -> 11443.73s]  But when it came to stretching out
[11444.37s -> 11451.41s]  Big splash is the body doesn't go in quite on the straight and again that will be reflected in the scores
[11452.61s -> 11461.49s]  Ambitious is he gonna be with this attempt? I got it. This is backwards. Well, this is the toughest guy that he could possibly have chosen
[11466.23s -> 11468.55s]  Certainly can improve on that second round performance
[11471.81s -> 11476.29s]  I keep thinking of the accordion. It's fucking messing me up. I could just see the tiny little errors
[11477.25s -> 11482.61s]  No doubt there are a few nerves as the scores start to come in god damn it. All right, come on
[11483.65s -> 11488.80s]  Team usa needs to pick this one up. They've not been very good so far. They're back in seventh
[11489.76s -> 11495.59s]  Well, it's pulled out of that dive
[11496.55s -> 11498.07s]  Excuse me
[11498.07s -> 11501.19s]  There will be another opportunity needs to compose himself here
[11507.91s -> 11509.19s]  Well, not bad
[11509.19s -> 11510.47s]  I don't
[11510.47s -> 11516.44s]  Let's take a look at the replay a degree of difficulty and well executed
[11517.62s -> 11524.02s]  That was not bad. What about the judges? What's their view on seven seven seven eight eight? Yeah, that was good
[11524.42s -> 11529.06s]  So after that round six places what this athlete's looking at is not ideal
[11529.06s -> 11531.40s]  But at least it's two places above the bottom
[11534.36s -> 11543.49s]  This is a big moment a really really tough arcadum five community subs. What's going on arcadum? Thanks to the five subs
[11544.13s -> 11552.18s]  You guys don't know arcadum. I could do not know arcadum. It would be nice. That was a really fucking goddamn
[11552.98s -> 11554.98s]  Dungeon master i've ever seen in my life
[11556.50s -> 11560.66s]  Go check them out. That's the kind of performance. Thanks for the five subs dude if you're doing well
[11561.30s -> 11565.22s]  Is over to the judges to get their view on this
[11565.86s -> 11574.28s]  The dnd god himself. That's true. Let's have a look at the leaderboard and team usa are in fourth place
[11575.16s -> 11576.84s]  Does it get 10?
[11576.84s -> 11582.29s]  Wait, I got a 10. No way. Wait, can I can I get somebody clip that? I want to watch it
[11582.53s -> 11584.53s]  I didn't even see it. What happened?
[11585.00s -> 11587.00s]  I got tens across the board
[11588.98s -> 11593.22s]  Holy shit taking those more difficult dives as this competition goes on
[11596.58s -> 11602.52s]  Well, this is an ambitious bold and brave choice can this athlete do it? Oh seriously, thanks arcadum
[11603.30s -> 11604.90s]  we're playing uh
[11604.90s -> 11607.33s]  We're playing olympic games
[11607.80s -> 11610.32s]  And I beat everything
[11610.32s -> 11612.32s]  I don't know what just happened, but that was fucking 10
[11612.80s -> 11616.64s]  That was 10 had to be this that was unbelievable. That was the best thing i've ever done
[11616.72s -> 11623.91s]  Of a belly flop i'm afraid to say check this shit up took the big risk and it didn't come off on this occasion
[11624.79s -> 11626.79s]  Not a good gamble as we look at the replay
[11629.56s -> 11631.56s]  Well, the judges will have their say now
[11634.12s -> 11637.08s]  Here's the scoreboard team usa have to adjust
[11639.80s -> 11641.80s]  I'm trying it's left and right on the d-pad, right?
[11642.44s -> 11651.52s]  But just a shame the end didn't quite match the start with that dive
[11652.40s -> 11656.85s]  Whatever. Let's have a look how the judges rated it
[11660.31s -> 11663.35s]  That's fine. We didn't I who gives a shit about the three meter i'm with a 10 meter
[11669.57s -> 11673.97s]  He's a pc gamer. He doesn't know what his stick is. I it's I know this is the one I wanted to do
[11677.64s -> 11679.64s]  Here's the huge one, this is the high dive
[11685.28s -> 11687.28s]  Wait, how do you do this?
[11693.76s -> 11697.78s]  What's a frustration I think in the end a shake of the head
[11698.74s -> 11701.94s]  I
[11704.34s -> 11706.34s]  Just had like a party in college
[11707.38s -> 11709.38s]  Check this shit out
[11711.27s -> 11714.63s]  No, no, no bob. Don't do it. I'm gonna do a big one
[11716.23s -> 11720.84s]  I'm going off the roof
[11720.92s -> 11724.20s]  Get him off the fucking roof. Don't I don't want him on my fucking my roof
[11725.16s -> 11728.30s]  They're currently sitting last place. That was a 10 difficulty
[11733.03s -> 11736.31s]  Only this athlete knows i'm gonna give you a few minutes
[11737.11s -> 11739.27s]  It's gonna take you a long time to get over this image. I think
[11750.15s -> 11753.67s]  Didn't like that at all and pulled out just in time
[11755.27s -> 11762.90s]  I'm afraid to say that was nowhere near the best from the diver from the usa
[11764.40s -> 11766.77s]  God damn it
[11767.33s -> 11776.37s]  Not enough asian not enough strength also seem a little bit out of sync the entry into the water will cost some valuable points
[11777.73s -> 11784.05s]  I'm trying to down the timing of that dive a shake of the head in frustration and understandably so
[11785.01s -> 11787.01s]  Just do i'm hurting him
[11787.01s -> 11789.01s]  Didn't achieve what he set out to there
[11789.57s -> 11791.81s]  I'm just doing the easy one
[11791.81s -> 11794.37s]  Fourth dive must select a good one here
[11795.33s -> 11806.04s]  To cram all of that into the routine but not quite why is this guy in the olympics as he would have wanted
[11806.84s -> 11809.80s]  I don't know. It's like it's like the commission his son is the replay
[11810.36s -> 11812.36s]  This one of the more simple dives
[11812.68s -> 11816.04s]  And this athlete really had to execute on this
[11817.24s -> 11819.88s]  Let's take another look at the scoreboard. I want to try something
[11821.16s -> 11832.09s]  Massively difficult this dive forgettable. That was a forgettable performance
[11832.81s -> 11836.97s]  What was wrong with that
[11836.97s -> 11840.17s]  Here's the replay and this diver may want to look away now
[11844.41s -> 11848.65s]  That was just like dropping an action figure that will cost dearly off your tree house
[11849.96s -> 11854.76s]  It is the pool
[11855.50s -> 11857.66s]  Team usa are in last place
[11858.46s -> 11864.31s]  Went to the final round then to get what the hell
[11867.67s -> 11870.55s]  This diver is gonna have to take the biggest risk possible
[11870.95s -> 11874.12s]  I
[11874.12s -> 11877.22s]  Dive that
[11877.22s -> 11878.90s]  Here's the replay
[11878.90s -> 11881.94s]  It was an ambitious dive but just not executed at all
[11883.61s -> 11885.21s]  All right, that was fun
[11885.21s -> 11888.52s]  I'm doing the next one
[11888.52s -> 11892.28s]  I'm not done until we do the actual scientific hypothetical theory thing
[11899.21s -> 11901.77s]  Oh, this is the vault. Okay. I'm looking forward to this
[11904.84s -> 11906.62s]  Tuck with it. Wait
[11906.62s -> 11908.62s]  Oh, this is not a pole vault
[11909.18s -> 11911.18s]  I thought this was the pole vault
[11916.04s -> 11918.04s]  Press into your somersault
[11919.45s -> 11921.94s]  0.5 twist
[11921.94s -> 11924.33s]  And then hit down
[11924.33s -> 11930.86s]  It looks like it hurt
[11933.26s -> 11935.62s]  All right, we're just gonna do tuck
[11945.02s -> 11947.66s]  Concentration there just didn't perform the selected vault
[11948.54s -> 11954.28s]  Oh, that's just simply disappointing. They're not gonna be happy with that
[11958.09s -> 11961.37s]  Oh, so let's indulge and have another look at this. Here's the replay
[11965.14s -> 11968.18s]  Why did gravity turn up times five when I got halfway there
[11969.06s -> 11971.06s]  So here come the judges scores
[11971.94s -> 11975.62s]  Quick look at the scores at the end of that round and as you'll see
[11975.78s -> 11981.14s]  Do I have a backpack with magnets on me and there's a negatively charged ion plate underneath me
[11982.50s -> 11984.50s]  Straight i'll get this one be hard
[11984.66s -> 11992.26s]  Well, this is really interesting stuff now a medium difficulty selection could really turn out to be a good choice for this gymnast
[11997.24s -> 11999.24s]  Yep, i'm okay
[12001.00s -> 12003.80s]  You don't die that just made it a taffy i'm gonna be fine
[12006.63s -> 12009.51s]  Well, let's have a quick look at the highlights of that performance then
[12012.74s -> 12019.98s]  Well in come the scores now, but I honestly can't see this gymnast getting high points for that vault
[12020.38s -> 12024.30s]  All right. What am I doing wrong here? I'm trying to stick it with with the uh left on the analog
[12025.34s -> 12027.26s]  That's too late
[12027.26s -> 12041.29s]  I want to do that one again. This is eason dawney. Welcome to the final of the men's single scores
[12042.25s -> 12044.47s]  What is skulls?
[12044.47s -> 12047.75s]  Wait, wait, it's a it's a rowboat competition
[12048.47s -> 12053.21s]  Let's take a look at the line up
[12054.14s -> 12056.57s]  tutorial
[12063.32s -> 12065.40s]  Press and hold the triggers to begin rowing
[12066.95s -> 12069.35s]  Release l2 to return the oars and do it again
[12081.18s -> 12089.43s]  double tap to boost
[12089.51s -> 12104.25s]  Hey, i'm going to show you everybody at the gym that uses this fucking thing. It's the only specters cross the finish line backwards
[12111.48s -> 12113.48s]  And like you want to correct them
[12113.48s -> 12115.48s]  But like when you see somebody at the gym going like this
[12117.27s -> 12120.39s]  It's like, oh no, he's just kind of gonna keep he's gonna do his thing
[12121.19s -> 12124.76s]  Okay
[12124.76s -> 12133.27s]  I'm gonna go all the way
[12141.91s -> 12143.91s]  Saves gum
[12148.71s -> 12154.47s]  Why am I getting destroyed
[12158.66s -> 12160.66s]  Why is there so many people on bikes over there
[12162.02s -> 12164.02s]  Are there two events going on at the same time?
[12194.14s -> 12198.00s]  Just losing to the bikes i'm i'm not racing the bikes
[12205.80s -> 12211.80s]  Sites and situated not far away from winza castle. This is one of the more pit to rest venues
[12213.99s -> 12216.34s]  Go
[12216.34s -> 12219.06s]  All six rowers pull away from the blocks then here
[12224.39s -> 12228.71s]  Well, this has been a decent performance so far but needs to up the stroke rate here
[12230.45s -> 12233.01s]  breathless day
[12233.11s -> 12235.11s]  Terrific conditions to rowing
[12235.51s -> 12244.73s]  Britain the front runner. This is an impressive performance
[12245.61s -> 12251.93s]  Good pace this from china have a real chance of winning belgium are doing well here in third place
[12252.81s -> 12256.01s]  Just to piss off the pace team usa they're back in sixth
[12256.97s -> 12270.62s]  Through 500 meters. That's the halfway point
[12274.04s -> 12276.04s]  Go faster. I can't
[12291.76s -> 12299.10s]  What's wrong with me what's wrong with my guy what's why is he quitting what's wrong with my guys
[12316.57s -> 12321.05s]  All right, if there were 10 people on this i'm the one guy pretending to row and not doing any work
[12342.28s -> 12360.00s]  Hurts my arms and i'm not even doing it just pulling in leaning back to chill him
[12360.16s -> 12368.78s]  See again not a particularly good performance
[12368.94s -> 12373.55s]  Right early on was down and then when he needed to pull through it didn't quite happen
[12373.95s -> 12377.79s]  The middle section just letting him down and then coming down the home straight
[12378.19s -> 12380.67s]  We're really expecting more from this athlete
[12380.67s -> 12385.15s]  But on this occasion, he just couldn't quite put in the performance we were hoping for
[12386.27s -> 12387.95s]  All right, I want to do some stuff
[12387.95s -> 12396.84s]  I want to do some things
[12396.84s -> 12400.30s]  All right, each folly ball weight lifting
[12403.53s -> 12407.29s]  Karen what did I did that right kayak single of karen? Wasn't that the
[12408.49s -> 12415.64s]  Isn't karen the same thing?
[12415.64s -> 12426.70s]  Did I do both?
[12426.70s -> 12429.58s]  All right. I want to do
[12429.58s -> 12433.74s]  What's the last thing? I don't think I really yeah, let's just do these I want to do I want my theory to play out
[12435.63s -> 12437.63s]  Oh karen's the bike, right? Okay
[12440.04s -> 12451.96s]  I want to say something
[12451.96s -> 12453.96s]  You wanted to do the vault again?
[12454.76s -> 12456.76s]  All right, i'll do that before I go
[12457.36s -> 12459.36s]  my too late flop
[12462.80s -> 12464.16s]  No
[12464.16s -> 12469.82s]  Oh, I would do 3d mode, too. Yeah, there's still more to do. Hold on. All right, here we go men's 100 meter
[12475.32s -> 12477.47s]  Here we go
[12477.47s -> 12498.54s]  They must get off the blocks quickly ready. Oh, it doesn't automatically it doesn't I can't do it. I wish I could
[12499.02s -> 12508.25s]  Injury
[12508.25s -> 12511.61s]  Seemed to struggle with this one from the start. I don't know what was wrong
[12511.69s -> 12517.61s]  But maybe there was an injury or something else just didn't look as smooth and the result very much reflects that
[12524.75s -> 12526.75s]  And it's gold for jamaica
[12526.99s -> 12528.51s]  Okay
[12528.51s -> 12530.19s]  Let's check out the other one
[12530.19s -> 12532.43s]  Because I didn't do this one coming up. Yeah, I didn't do volleyball
[12537.85s -> 12541.77s]  I feel like I want to put in the beijing one and play the other events that aren't in this game
[12543.69s -> 12545.69s]  We're gonna do that i'm putting in beijing one
[12546.33s -> 12551.69s]  With the sam that's arrived for the 2012 games. There's other events. I think on this game that aren't out here
[12552.57s -> 12554.57s]  I'm gonna i'm gonna just play them
[12557.31s -> 12559.95s]  All right, serve bar, but this is an actual game of volleyball
[12560.75s -> 12577.05s]  Okay, then press x press x before the target begins flashing
[12580.06s -> 12582.06s]  Use l hold l
[12593.69s -> 12595.69s]  I get it. I know how to play volleyball
[12601.45s -> 12615.60s]  All right, let's go i'm putting in beijing wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no I want to do
[12616.48s -> 12619.66s]  Stop putting in beijing
[12620.14s -> 12625.58s]  I'm gonna take a piss and go i'm putting beijing. Oh, yeah, 3d mode. Yeah, right, right, right, right
[12626.22s -> 12642.25s]  It's probably gonna fuck up the tv. Is this gonna fuck up the tv? How is this 3d?
[12644.11s -> 12654.78s]  You just see it twice
[12654.78s -> 12658.75s]  You have to cross your eyes
[12658.75s -> 12660.99s]  Oh, you need the glasses. Okay, but hold on a minute
[12661.71s -> 12663.87s]  What the hell would 3d glasses do for this?
[12668.94s -> 12672.27s]  But what would it do?
[12672.27s -> 12674.27s]  Do I need my individual eyes?
[12674.91s -> 12678.17s]  You need to type be a 3d monitor
[12681.50s -> 12689.12s]  Oh, okay. All right beer back. I'm gonna put in beijing and i'm gonna go uh, take a quick break up beer back
[12689.60s -> 12922.52s]  Okay. Hi, um, why is this taking so long to make a save profile?
[12926.64s -> 12928.64s]  Saving please do not switch the power off
[12928.80s -> 12930.80s]  Didn't just take one second
[12933.02s -> 12935.58s]  Why is it saving 10 gigs of space I don't understand
[12939.90s -> 12948.20s]  Why is it taking so long
[12950.36s -> 12953.64s]  What do you want us to tell you make me I don't know make me feel better say I don't know
[12953.64s -> 12956.01s]  Do your ps3 is just working hard
[12963.92s -> 12970.51s]  I can hear it. Can you guys hear the weird little like switch it off switch it off switch it off. What do you mean?
[12971.15s -> 12973.05s]  It's fine
[12973.05s -> 12975.05s]  It's just a old ps3
[12980.22s -> 12982.78s]  Yeah, so this is 2008. So if we're probably gonna
[12983.50s -> 12986.22s]  Lose some physics and some graphics on the way back
[12996.03s -> 12998.67s]  The worrying of the hard drive. Yeah, okay. I think we're good. I'll be
[13002.06s -> 13004.06s]  Sega I think we're good
[13006.99s -> 13013.18s]  I probably need to change the title, huh powered by games by that's very old
[13016.16s -> 13018.16s]  2008
[13021.76s -> 13023.76s]  The official olympic games
[13025.07s -> 13029.72s]  2008 already looks a little crusty
[13032.65s -> 13041.29s]  Can you already do this?
[13041.29s -> 13043.29s]  Some games no, I don't care
[13044.70s -> 13046.38s]  All right competition
[13046.38s -> 13051.79s]  Some features of competition only available sign. I don't care
[13053.60s -> 13055.60s]  Play on this system
[13060.11s -> 13065.40s]  track, okay
[13065.40s -> 13068.20s]  Field. Yeah. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a minute. There's
[13068.92s -> 13070.28s]  hammer throw
[13070.28s -> 13074.32s]  Let's do 100 100 meter
[13077.21s -> 13081.24s]  Hammer throw
[13081.24s -> 13083.24s]  This does look like a racing game. You're right. It does
[13085.61s -> 13086.97s]  diving
[13086.97s -> 13091.56s]  Let's do diving
[13091.56s -> 13092.89s]  uh
[13092.89s -> 13097.77s]  Parallel bars rings floor exercise beam uneven bars. Yeah
[13100.41s -> 13102.41s]  shotgun air pistol
[13103.10s -> 13105.10s]  We did these let's do air pistol
[13106.83s -> 13109.84s]  archery weight lifting
[13109.84s -> 13112.27s]  judo
[13115.93s -> 13117.93s]  Combined events to cap one
[13118.33s -> 13120.99s]  Okay
[13120.99s -> 13122.75s]  I'm ready. Let's do it
[13122.75s -> 13140.99s]  I'm looking forward to judo
[13140.99s -> 13143.31s]  Hey, i'm back from the playstation stream. It sucked
[13143.87s -> 13148.38s]  Wait, like an official ps playstation stream is well, what are they doing? What are they talking about?
[13150.09s -> 13157.79s]  Anything interesting?
[13157.79s -> 13159.79s]  This feels like an old sega game
[13160.20s -> 13162.92s]  I hold l2 and r2 to build power
[13165.18s -> 13168.22s]  Once the power bar hits the red zone, you'll launch from the blocks
[13171.92s -> 13176.56s]  Press x and o alternately or toggle l and r to build up speed
[13177.28s -> 13180.92s]  This is way more complicated than 2012
[13181.72s -> 13184.48s]  Press r2 to showboat
[13184.64s -> 13191.21s]  All right, let's go
[13191.21s -> 13197.55s]  Where am I?
[13197.55s -> 13199.55s]  Just showboat the whole time
[13199.55s -> 13213.10s]  Well, that's me
[13213.10s -> 13221.42s]  All right, hold l2 and r2
[13224.33s -> 13228.54s]  Okay, here we go
[13228.54s -> 13260.57s]  What who the fuck is that guy? What's that guy doing? Is there a waiter here? Oh, no, that's official. Okay
[13267.84s -> 13273.93s]  All right, I lost that one's way more complicated than the first than the I said first game
[13273.93s -> 13280.97s]  But it's the second game first game of the night. I can't wait to do hammer throw
[13281.77s -> 13285.05s]  If I knew that hammer throw was an olympic sport, I probably would have tried to do it
[13285.53s -> 13287.93s]  That sounds like fun. Just whipping a hammer as hard as you can
[13290.83s -> 13292.83s]  I get why people do this shit. That's fun
[13298.03s -> 13312.67s]  Throw a hammer as hard as you can you got it. Oh, it's this
[13316.28s -> 13324.17s]  It's the back the fuck away from me or I cannot control if you die or not event
[13325.64s -> 13327.64s]  Holy shit, this is gonna be impossible
[13331.20s -> 13333.20s]  I don't hold on. I can we do that again?
[13333.68s -> 13343.13s]  Okay, so you start spinning
[13344.52s -> 13346.12s]  rotate l
[13346.12s -> 13348.12s]  To match the marker
[13350.11s -> 13352.59s]  Press l2 or r2 to release the hammer
[13353.39s -> 13376.89s]  What direction should I throw the damn thing? He's gonna wreck somebody in the crowd
[13377.61s -> 13382.84s]  Now that's what the fence is for
[13382.84s -> 13386.92s]  The long shot is a very long close-up of this guy's face
[13391.90s -> 13394.06s]  I mean, is it skip or is it continue?
[13394.62s -> 13401.32s]  What'd you say?
[13401.32s -> 13410.44s]  I skip it
[13410.44s -> 13423.98s]  No, do not skip you're skipping don't skip. No skip. Don't skip. Yes
[13427.53s -> 13428.97s]  All right, let's go
[13428.97s -> 13433.07s]  Okay, just gonna match the
[13434.38s -> 13448.57s]  Match it with the meter surrounding him. Wait, i'm not the ball. I thought I was the ball
[13448.65s -> 13451.69s]  I thought I was the ball. I didn't I thought the ball was my movement and not
[13452.65s -> 13459.50s]  Okay, I get it
[13459.50s -> 13484.04s]  Why wouldn't I be him turning and not what i'm i'm the meter turning? Come on. Okay, i'll get it this time
[13485.00s -> 13515.79s]  Pick up not bad. That's all right
[13517.79s -> 13523.48s]  He's just not producing his best today
[13524.12s -> 13528.04s]  Yeah, you can see as he walks off. He knows he needs to do better than that
[13528.60s -> 13531.88s]  Bit of a lackluster effort there needs to improve on that
[13532.52s -> 13539.00s]  Yeah, but in this event all it takes is that one big throw two ai's talking to each other. That's what it sounds like
[13549.92s -> 13552.48s]  Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. Well, i'm you know what I mean though
[13573.10s -> 13575.82s]  Oh foul you didn't take that long to tell me it was a foul
[13576.62s -> 13599.44s]  You could have done it immediately. That's pretty good
[13615.82s -> 13626.67s]  Damn it. I can do it again. I can be better with the ball. That's hard to do. I'll get it
[13638.41s -> 13640.41s]  That's gonna be a fucking world record right there
[13640.57s -> 13648.72s]  Right measure that shit. That's above the world record
[13650.62s -> 13656.72s]  Yep
[13656.72s -> 13671.96s]  Did it that's he's doing the hulk hogan. That's what I would do. That's a great celebration
[13679.52s -> 13681.52s]  three fouls and world record
[13683.10s -> 13692.38s]  All it takes is one man
[13707.18s -> 13712.09s]  Nice all right. Let's hear it. It's time for the music
[13712.73s -> 13739.63s]  Please stand for the national anthem of the united states of america. I'll be right
[13745.50s -> 13747.50s]  I don't think you can get dmca'd
[13748.06s -> 13761.05s]  With the national anthem
[13761.13s -> 13764.84s]  You're gonna get sued
[13765.48s -> 13769.88s]  What was next there was a lot of shit on this list i'm looking forward some of them were crazy
[13777.02s -> 13779.84s]  Disney owns it. I think the day that happens
[13780.40s -> 13782.00s]  That's the turning point
[13782.00s -> 13785.54s]  But for society just to collapse like absolutely collapse
[13792.27s -> 13798.99s]  Like if disney copyrights the national anthem you're gonna be eating your food out of an old can that's in your basement like there's no way
[13799.87s -> 13805.87s]  Oh, here we go. This is a big one
[13818.20s -> 13823.08s]  Anybody understand this rotate l to match the green marker and r to match the red marker
[13824.24s -> 13833.39s]  Oh, I don't think you're gonna pick my dive
[13834.03s -> 13866.17s]  Oh, here we go
[13866.17s -> 13873.98s]  Wait, where are the balls? Oh, I get it. Okay. I get it. You have to
[13874.91s -> 13881.31s]  I thought I was the balls again
[13881.31s -> 13883.31s]  This is fucking horrible
[13898.81s -> 13910.33s]  I get it
[13910.33s -> 13927.05s]  Yeah, that's hard to do. It's like scratching your belly and patting your head at the same time. Why is it off to be in slow motion?
[13954.89s -> 13956.89s]  That was pretty damn good
[13958.48s -> 13960.48s]  That would have been at least eight or nine
[13961.36s -> 13967.77s]  This was when I was flashy as the other one. Let's see what happens if you just completely fuck the whole thing up
[13968.57s -> 13983.87s]  I'm gonna try to not get any points
[13983.87s -> 14000.57s]  What's with the harry potter whispering thing?
[14004.32s -> 14007.76s]  Actively pretending. Yeah, I I guess you just do the move but
[14008.56s -> 14010.99s]  depending on how long they were in the
[14014.72s -> 14019.20s]  I better get a zero, right?
[14020.88s -> 14025.18s]  Okay
[14025.18s -> 14030.38s]  Uh, I don't want I don't do that again. How do I speed time up?
[14043.98s -> 14052.04s]  This game is way worse. Yeah, it is way worse. Well, we haven't gotten to judo yet. So hold on hold that thought
[14072.19s -> 14074.41s]  All right, that's it, right?
[14074.41s -> 14095.21s]  That's it. You have to dive 10 times
[14096.88s -> 14098.19s]  What?
[14098.19s -> 14099.55s]  No, I don't
[14099.55s -> 14114.27s]  I don't know how you make the high dive not fun in a video game
[14114.99s -> 14128.32s]  Is that even possible?
[14128.32s -> 14137.80s]  All right. Cool. Good saw waiting room. I don't even know what that disc is. It might even be gone
[14138.20s -> 14141.47s]  I have no idea where the saw disc is
[14147.45s -> 14149.45s]  You
[14150.41s -> 14153.53s]  This is giving me so much anxiety, holy shit boy why
[14159.39s -> 14164.51s]  To skip to saw 2 I have to buy saw 2 I don't own it i'm gonna play it though
[14165.93s -> 14168.65s]  Here we go. Now it's time to fucking plug
[14178.46s -> 14181.18s]  Parallel bars i'm gonna do all kinds of crazy shit up here
[14181.82s -> 14187.66s]  There's l2 and r2 to until vertical to achieve a good lift
[14188.46s -> 14192.65s]  So you go bang bang bang bang bang bang bang, okay, then how do you trick
[14193.45s -> 14198.60s]  The l and r left or right to position the arrows beneath the hands
[14199.48s -> 14204.49s]  Okay
[14204.49s -> 14207.77s]  Press the displayed buttons in order for the perfect dismount
[14208.49s -> 14211.93s]  Okay, let's go
[14211.93s -> 14230.38s]  Sounds like wario. We're gonna jump up or no. How do you approach this?
[14231.02s -> 14246.04s]  Oh like that good. Here we go
[14250.64s -> 14259.56s]  I'm doing that. I guess
[14259.56s -> 14269.63s]  Pretty good. Wait, what's this?
[14269.63s -> 14274.35s]  This is just like lining up mini game line thing just not even doing anything
[14274.35s -> 14289.90s]  It's just placed weird circle underneath where he is. I'll tell you if you ever have it wait
[14299.10s -> 14311.84s]  Games quiet. Oh shit lost
[14314.11s -> 14320.11s]  Game sucks. The london one's better. I know I know but I we gotta see the events that I didn't play in london
[14320.67s -> 14332.72s]  Turn it back down. That was one guy. Okay, play the 2016 one
[14333.20s -> 14338.94s]  What is it for is it a ps4 and xbox one?
[14346.68s -> 14350.76s]  I was under the impression that after 2012 the games would really just awful
[14352.28s -> 14356.04s]  Keep the fucking arrows. I'm not I want to keep the arrows. How do I skip this?
[14356.92s -> 14385.13s]  These little mini games. I'm not even controlling anybody just fall off just fall off
[14386.96s -> 14390.22s]  Don't hold it. Just fall down
[14390.22s -> 14392.51s]  fall down
[14392.51s -> 14404.27s]  Fall it's just gonna play the animation. No matter what it's just based on how many that's sad
[14405.15s -> 14406.27s]  Dad
[14406.27s -> 14416.38s]  Yeah, this 2012 was way better
[14416.86s -> 14425.68s]  Thank god we're out of that. I need to get to judo first and there's a shooting one
[14426.24s -> 14434.32s]  Huge disc is throw but throw the disc in real life
[14439.26s -> 14448.46s]  I wonder how far I could throw a disc frisbee style. What do you think? I could probably get it
[14451.45s -> 14453.45s]  It doesn't weigh that much. I'm gonna say
[14455.20s -> 14464.24s]  25 feet 30 feet. Is that really under shooting it there 40 feet? I could do more than 40 feet
[14464.56s -> 14473.20s]  I could probably get please don't have please let me walk around. Please please let me walk around
[14473.92s -> 14477.24s]  Please not have it be a mini game. Let me walk around and do moves, please
[14487.90s -> 14498.48s]  That's it. That's it. I can't walk around with the analog and jump and stuff. Come on
[14501.63s -> 14504.74s]  None of this matters i'm gonna hit i'm just gonna hit every button randomly
[14517.53s -> 14520.60s]  David cage game
[14521.00s -> 14525.16s]  The only difference is there's a story there
[14525.64s -> 14534.28s]  No story here. Look at me
[14539.36s -> 14542.16s]  What do you think my floor exercise would be
[14542.96s -> 14546.70s]  Dude, what if I did like a germa olympics?
[14547.18s -> 14554.51s]  Has this got a bunch of like my drunk friends to come and do like random things
[14555.31s -> 14557.31s]  The floor exercises and stuff
[14560.86s -> 14566.54s]  And then you guys would have to vote on who wins. I kind of like this idea
[14572.84s -> 14574.78s]  I need that
[14574.78s -> 14576.78s]  I wonder how the other one would actually take
[14583.74s -> 14587.74s]  Last time you did a floor exercise you left for two months. Well, I wouldn't participate in that
[14587.90s -> 14590.35s]  Six
[14590.35s -> 14595.39s]  I could do a floor exercise. I don't have to move around that much. I can just fucking pantomime and move my hands and
[14596.75s -> 14598.75s]  Like magic tricks and stuff
[14599.07s -> 14608.96s]  That's awful. This game is awful
[14608.96s -> 14615.24s]  It's truly awful
[14615.24s -> 14617.56s]  One of these has to pop out and make us
[14618.84s -> 14632.97s]  Happy, right? One of something's got to pop out here to do mario and sonic. There is a new one, isn't there?
[14637.37s -> 14640.81s]  No, I don't even want to do I know what it's gonna be. I already know what it's gonna be
[14640.97s -> 14642.81s]  I don't want to even see it
[14642.81s -> 14647.12s]  I already know what's gonna happen. It's gonna be just stand still. Why just press x once
[14647.92s -> 14664.64s]  That doesn't matter. It's tony hawke grinding
[14671.28s -> 14675.69s]  You can actually fall
[14675.69s -> 14677.69s]  By the way, I always saw this
[14677.93s -> 14680.57s]  As the most difficult thing that a human being could do
[14682.51s -> 14684.67s]  In any doesn't matter what no matter what it is
[14685.82s -> 14688.54s]  This he doing a backflip and landing on this
[14689.26s -> 14693.34s]  And not shattering every bone in your body is insane that you can do a backflip and land on here
[14694.59s -> 14696.99s]  Do like a backflip and spin four times in the air
[14697.71s -> 14700.20s]  It's a cartoon. It's not even possible
[14701.24s -> 14717.20s]  I named something harder than this. What what is harder than this doing surgery on somebody?
[14719.82s -> 14723.79s]  uh
[14723.79s -> 14724.83s]  I mean that's that's hard
[14724.83s -> 14730.19s]  But is it hard is it as hard as doing a backflip on a one inch beam and staying up and like doing all kinds of like
[14730.19s -> 14732.19s]  Look at me using all that
[14733.93s -> 14743.79s]  Shattering your bones. Do you know what they're made out of?
[14745.21s -> 14746.65s]  wood
[14746.65s -> 14750.73s]  This is like a block of hard like foam wood shit. I don't even know what that I don't know what it is
[14757.63s -> 14761.07s]  No, that wooden bones the actual banister thing what is it made out of?
[14775.71s -> 14778.19s]  Guys if your hand if your body was made out of wood
[14779.44s -> 14782.88s]  Opening and closing your car door would just hurt you every day
[14787.95s -> 14789.95s]  Walking up the stairs would be hell
[14790.83s -> 14793.15s]  Oh my god, I thought this is gonna be so much fun
[14793.79s -> 14798.51s]  I thought it was gonna be so fun with all these different gymnastics events and they got rid of them in 2012 because they realized that
[14798.51s -> 14800.51s]  They couldn't figure out a way to make it fun
[14802.14s -> 14818.59s]  That's why none of them are here
[14818.67s -> 14820.67s]  They could they just didn't that's true
[14822.09s -> 14825.55s]  Thank god. It was quick judo better not be like this
[14825.55s -> 14828.99s]  I better be able to hit circle to punch and x to kick or i'm gonna be really mad
[14835.47s -> 14837.71s]  If judo is a rhythm game, i'm gonna pull the disc out
[14841.34s -> 14846.22s]  You heard it if judo is a rhythm game. I'm i'm pressing the release disc button
[14846.78s -> 14872.09s]  I'm gonna snap the disc. It's dangerous. I don't do dangerous things on stream anymore. You don't kick in judo
[14875.98s -> 14879.82s]  Here we are finally now we can actually get some goddamn action
[14880.62s -> 14890.56s]  I didn't do the tutorial
[14890.56s -> 14899.02s]  You just shoot why am I setting up a math problem?
[14908.92s -> 14910.68s]  What's the point of the first one?
[14910.68s -> 14915.60s]  What's the point of of using graph paper?
[14916.32s -> 14928.80s]  It's pulling me down
[14928.80s -> 14944.48s]  It's the hand getting tired
[14944.48s -> 14951.32s]  Why can I not set that every time?
[14953.24s -> 14955.24s]  They by the way, do they shoot bullets?
[14955.96s -> 14960.99s]  Or is this like pellets or something? By the way, what's going on here?
[14961.63s -> 14971.76s]  It's just hold on six. Okay. I was I thought I was gonna keep shooting the same spot where eight was
[14972.48s -> 14985.60s]  Yeah, what is going on with these glasses?
[14989.15s -> 14992.68s]  What are those? Is one of them a magnifier and the other one?
[14993.32s -> 14996.52s]  Is this a jeweler? Is he working on diamonds? I don't know. What is this for?
[15000.16s -> 15002.16s]  Looks like a warcraft gnome
[15006.35s -> 15008.75s]  This is crazy. Well, i'm i'm what is it for?
[15009.31s -> 15015.02s]  I kind of want to try these on
[15015.02s -> 15022.38s]  Just close one eye and just look through kind of the magnified one
[15023.10s -> 15025.53s]  I think I would like these in real life
[15025.85s -> 15029.12s]  If I was able to switch those down
[15042.43s -> 15058.48s]  Plus two perception. Yeah, that'd be awesome. I'm not even trying i'm just kind of hitting things
[15065.69s -> 15069.60s]  Grandma, look at me. Hey, look at you
[15073.98s -> 15075.98s]  I'm not trying but at least I get to play
[15079.40s -> 15082.52s]  10.7 is not just 10.0. There's higher than 10
[15093.32s -> 15101.64s]  Get extra in the middle
[15101.64s -> 15103.64s]  You can get in the middle of the middle
[15111.87s -> 15114.22s]  Yeah, I guess I lost
[15114.22s -> 15116.59s]  didn't even place
[15116.59s -> 15118.59s]  archery, okay
[15120.03s -> 15122.03s]  This one should be fun
[15122.11s -> 15127.23s]  I thought the controller was on her head. I thought it was like what's with all these weird apparatus?
[15127.39s -> 15129.39s]  I thought that was something on her head
[15129.63s -> 15137.02s]  Okay, wait
[15137.02s -> 15152.92s]  Whatever let's go seven. Oh
[15154.52s -> 15164.30s]  You think they're ever gonna make a game that uses the huntsman style bow and arrow mechanics in an actual video game
[15165.56s -> 15169.92s]  I want it so bad
[15170.56s -> 15179.45s]  TF2 has that yeah, it's been like 12 years
[15182.04s -> 15184.44s]  I'm not talking. Hey, i'm i'm not saying
[15185.08s -> 15190.35s]  Hey, give me a game. That was give me a game eight years ago. That came up with this. I want one now
[15191.15s -> 15193.64s]  And I want it to be like a single player game
[15193.64s -> 15197.08s]  I don't want to be online because people are way better than me online and they'll just shoot me the barn
[15197.08s -> 15200.92s]  I run the head first before I can shoot them. So I want to do it at my own pace with my own single player time
[15202.68s -> 15205.80s]  No, not in minecraft. I'm talking where the whole game is based around like awesome
[15206.36s -> 15208.20s]  perfect incredible
[15208.20s -> 15211.28s]  archery mechanics six
[15211.28s -> 15216.00s]  Just bow and arrow just perfect like they spend three years perfect making it perfect
[15223.32s -> 15226.91s]  seven horizon
[15226.91s -> 15231.47s]  No, it's not no, it's gotta be first person. It's gotta be first person
[15232.11s -> 15243.61s]  I thought it was actually gonna hit still just make it yourself
[15245.63s -> 15247.95s]  I don't I don't know shit about making video games
[15255.85s -> 15257.85s]  forehead
[15262.91s -> 15264.91s]  Crisis three, is it good?
[15273.36s -> 15279.04s]  Crisis is a weird game. I feel like i've never played crisis before but I know i've played it but it sits in this weird place
[15279.04s -> 15282.24s]  In my memory where I may as well have never even opened it once
[15282.88s -> 15293.16s]  I don't remember anything to me crisis and far cry
[15293.72s -> 15296.04s]  Just blend together into the same video game in my head
[15301.90s -> 15313.50s]  Ten and they're very different. Yeah, I I don't know why it's just that's the case
[15314.30s -> 15318.59s]  You know what? I think it probably is nine
[15320.11s -> 15324.75s]  There's like seven bar cries and like four crises. It's like they they just feel like they're all
[15325.23s -> 15327.23s]  There's a lot of them
[15327.23s -> 15332.92s]  How many crises are there?
[15333.00s -> 15337.47s]  Nine three four, right?
[15346.32s -> 15354.11s]  It's 2020 bro. Every day. There's a new one. Is that guy wearing flowers as a watch?
[15354.19s -> 15369.28s]  I skipped it way too quickly. It looked like it it come our judo. Here comes the judo dream
[15370.08s -> 15374.11s]  No, it's weightlifting
[15374.11s -> 15375.15s]  rotate
[15375.15s -> 15377.47s]  Eleanor opposite directions to increase power
[15382.12s -> 15385.48s]  Slowly rotate eleanor outwards from the bottom. This sucks
[15399.24s -> 15438.06s]  472 pounds
[15438.06s -> 15445.82s]  I can't even all right. It's you rotate different directions. That's so hard to do with i'm gonna do it. I'm gonna try two hands
[15446.99s -> 15449.79s]  My fingers bump into each other because it's a fucking playstation
[15450.75s -> 15457.66s]  Why would you make why would you do that?
[15458.49s -> 15464.25s]  If you put both your thumbs on the analogs and you rotate opposite directions your thumbs hit each other in the middle
[15466.72s -> 15468.88s]  That's the most bogus fucking thing in the world
[15477.16s -> 15479.16s]  Pick up a playstation 3 controller right now
[15479.78s -> 15485.24s]  Rotate it in opposite directions and come in and meet in the middle and you tell me that your thumbs don't touch
[15485.72s -> 15487.72s]  Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope
[15495.84s -> 15497.84s]  Your fat thumbs I don't
[15498.00s -> 15525.24s]  I'm having a look
[15526.62s -> 15530.67s]  Does it feel like you have like a company meeting like
[15532.25s -> 15536.65s]  Everybody, okay. Let's talk about this. All right. Yes, uh, let's go over the day here
[15537.13s -> 15542.88s]  Uh, so we've uh, that's done. It's all right. The game's done. It's ready to ship
[15543.68s -> 15546.40s]  It's not fun at all. It's like the opposite of fun
[15547.29s -> 15551.05s]  Uh, I don't know what may have I don't know. Wait, wait, hold on. I'm lifting
[15554.65s -> 15557.68s]  Turn your arms out
[15557.68s -> 15585.45s]  What?
[15585.45s -> 15587.53s]  Do it turn it up, man
[15589.63s -> 15600.32s]  You're right
[15600.32s -> 15602.99s]  Do it
[15602.99s -> 15606.99s]  He did I did I lifted it. What do you mean? No lift he put it over his head
[15608.68s -> 15610.68s]  He put it over his head
[15619.74s -> 15628.92s]  Let's see if he let's see if he lifts it. I don't think he lifted it. I don't think he did
[15629.56s -> 15635.87s]  What was I saying?
[15635.87s -> 15654.11s]  It doesn't matter. Come on. You can do it
[15654.19s -> 15666.16s]  Come on, you can do it
[15666.16s -> 15674.76s]  balance
[15674.76s -> 15676.76s]  That's the world. That's personal best. That's the world record
[15679.06s -> 15681.88s]  230 kilograms
[15681.88s -> 15686.75s]  Wait, what's 474?
[15687.79s -> 15692.14s]  I couldn't make it that high
[15692.14s -> 15710.81s]  Wait, that's the lowest the minimum weight. That's so funny. That's the minimum
[15711.13s -> 15733.68s]  Is it this is the only reason why I stuck around for this long in this game is for judo only
[15734.08s -> 15738.75s]  You understand i'm gonna get punch kick throw
[15739.80s -> 15740.68s]  Jump
[15740.68s -> 15743.50s]  It's not good. Yep. Okay
[15744.78s -> 15746.94s]  Match the arrows to gain an advantage
[15747.50s -> 15751.40s]  once you have the advantage press a combination of
[15751.96s -> 15754.92s]  This just punch punch punch punch kick punch fight
[15755.40s -> 15762.12s]  The throne reduced okay
[15762.12s -> 15765.64s]  When in or performing a hold or a pin press r2 l2
[15772.60s -> 15775.16s]  I don't I kind of don't I didn't I don't get any of that, but it's all right. Let's go
[15775.72s -> 15782.16s]  Here we go 81 to 90 kilograms
[15791.42s -> 15793.42s]  Destroy this isn't a rhythm game
[15808.62s -> 15811.45s]  Nah, you didn't get me
[15811.45s -> 15820.67s]  Oh shit, what happened? Is this judo? Are we trying to take the tags off of each other's shirts?
[15821.84s -> 15830.30s]  escape
[15830.30s -> 15853.71s]  Wait, who won?
[15856.16s -> 15857.84s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait
[15857.84s -> 15877.40s]  I didn't read the rule. I I I didn't read the rules. It said move move move
[15877.88s -> 15882.44s]  L2 r2 r2 r2 r2 r2 and then mash the face buttons
[15894.41s -> 15896.89s]  Okay, i'm ready
[15896.89s -> 15902.14s]  Let's go throne
[15909.77s -> 15913.72s]  Nope, what is this?
[15914.68s -> 15916.89s]  What's wrong with me?
[15916.89s -> 15920.01s]  What is it? Was he doing the mandible claw? What just happened?
[15930.51s -> 15947.92s]  Why did I just fall down?
[15947.92s -> 15950.48s]  All right. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm done
[15951.04s -> 15961.04s]  I'm done
[15961.04s -> 15966.00s]  Why would you play the judo one if you don't know what judo is? I know judo is an event. It's a martial art
[15966.00s -> 15968.00s]  We throw people in
[15968.86s -> 15970.86s]  If you get pinned you'll lose
[15979.52s -> 15982.08s]  That end of the stream voice
[15982.16s -> 15983.36s]  Yeah
[15983.36s -> 15985.12s]  Yeah, it probably is
[15985.12s -> 15991.29s]  It probably is
[15991.29s -> 15992.89s]  It probably is
[15992.89s -> 15999.20s]  That is accurate
[15999.20s -> 16001.04s]  Actually, I didn't do disc throw
[16001.04s -> 16006.20s]  Which is I want to do that
[16006.20s -> 16010.33s]  Not like it's gonna be any fun
[16010.33s -> 16020.96s]  But I plan on playing fall guys is what we're doing next to play that throw the disc out the window
[16021.68s -> 16022.88s]  no
[16022.88s -> 16025.20s]  Guys, i'm gonna put this back on ebay for a dollar five
[16025.76s -> 16028.80s]  I think that's what it was. It was like a dollar. It was a dollar and 10 cents
[16029.60s -> 16032.08s]  It was not more than a dollar. I know it wasn't it wasn't more than two
[16033.32s -> 16036.70s]  If it was then that's sad
[16036.70s -> 16039.66s]  When is movie night for real? I'll give you that I would give that to you right now
[16041.13s -> 16043.13s]  So the dlc, yeah
[16043.61s -> 16046.11s]  That came up on me out of nowhere
[16046.11s -> 16048.54s]  Uh dlc movie night
[16048.62s -> 16050.62s]  Uh at least like part one
[16051.88s -> 16053.40s]  is going to be
[16053.40s -> 16054.90s]  on
[16054.90s -> 16056.70s]  saturday
[16056.70s -> 16058.70s]  saturday the 29th
[16058.70s -> 16064.03s]  I think that gives me and some of the mods a lot of time to really get
[16064.75s -> 16069.88s]  a good playlist
[16069.88s -> 16073.96s]  They don't want to do it just like in the next week because I feel like there's a lot there's hundreds of them
[16074.60s -> 16077.68s]  So I really want to be able to go through those
[16078.33s -> 16080.83s]  So saturday the 29th
[16080.83s -> 16082.83s]  I'll get on your calendar. That's dlc movie night
[16086.80s -> 16090.24s]  So long from now, it's gonna go by real quick. I promise
[16091.28s -> 16108.81s]  I don't get it. I don't know how it works
[16109.69s -> 16111.77s]  But I will see you guys again. This is the
[16112.57s -> 16114.73s]  First time i've done two streams in a row since coming back
[16116.94s -> 16118.78s]  I have some stuff to do
[16118.78s -> 16120.22s]  Over this weekend
[16120.22s -> 16124.83s]  I'm gonna go do it. I'm gonna take care of it
[16125.39s -> 16128.08s]  And i'll see you guys on monday
[16128.08s -> 16130.80s]  Still continuing to ease back into live streaming
[16133.16s -> 16135.40s]  And I feel okay. I actually feel okay. I feel pretty good
[16137.48s -> 16139.64s]  but I don't want to
[16139.64s -> 16140.60s]  Push it
[16140.60s -> 16142.84s]  So I don't really want to do three days in a row
[16142.84s -> 16146.17s]  I really want to get up and move around
[16147.08s -> 16154.60s]  But I will see you guys on monday. I think that's a good place to start. We'll probably do
[16157.53s -> 16159.53s]  monday tuesday
[16159.69s -> 16163.69s]  Probably monday tuesday thursday if I would say next week
[16164.25s -> 16166.28s]  I think that makes a lot of sense
[16166.28s -> 16171.92s]  Because those of you that might be out of the loop. I just I know I say this at the end of every stream the last
[16173.50s -> 16175.50s]  Three or four streams since I come back
[16175.90s -> 16177.90s]  But i'm going backwards
[16178.78s -> 16179.58s]  to
[16179.58s -> 16184.70s]  Streaming less sort of how long I streamed and times I streamed before moving to vegas
[16186.11s -> 16188.11s]  I streamed probably three days a week
[16188.51s -> 16191.39s]  Back when I was in massachusetts for about four to six hours
[16191.95s -> 16193.79s]  So we're going back to that
[16193.79s -> 16201.68s]  This medical stuff is still ongoing. So i'm gonna keep it that way. I'm gonna keep it like it was a few years ago
[16204.75s -> 16205.71s]  so
[16205.71s -> 16208.75s]  I've had a lot of fun though sponge bob was a lot of fun these games
[16208.75s -> 16212.51s]  Well, then this one not so much, but 2012 was actually great. I had a lot of fun
[16213.15s -> 16220.03s]  Hope you enjoyed it. We'll see you maybe again on monday. Have a great weekend everybody. Let's see if I fixed the credits
[16220.03s -> 16221.87s]  I tried again today
[16221.87s -> 16225.24s]  I really did. Let's see if it worked
[16225.80s -> 16227.80s]  Here come all the subs maybe
[16228.54s -> 16230.54s]  Hey, I finally got it to work
[16230.86s -> 16232.62s]  This is not in the right spot
[16232.62s -> 16244.96s]  And the font is weird. Why is the font so weird? I'll fix that
[16246.75s -> 16249.50s]  But thanks everybody for subbing
[16249.50s -> 16254.40s]  We had some community subs. We had a lot 50 community subs today from suck mcjones
[16255.74s -> 16259.32s]  Thank you. That's a huge amount of money
[16259.32s -> 16265.47s]  Do a different font to every stream
[16266.35s -> 16271.82s]  Do I need to teach you how to use obs? No, i'm telling you i've done this correct
[16272.30s -> 16277.24s]  Every time I didn't change anything. Why did it change two months after me streaming? It doesn't make any sense
[16277.24s -> 16279.80s]  I didn't change anything. I don't like when things change around me
[16280.36s -> 16289.15s]  There's no music. What the hell am I doing? There's still no music sneak up on this sniper
[16290.62s -> 16295.61s]  Wait, why what was that?
[16295.61s -> 16297.61s]  Why was that so loud? What was that?
[16305.23s -> 16307.24s]  um
[16307.24s -> 16309.15s]  This is bizarre
[16309.15s -> 16311.15s]  Why is this right now?
[16312.28s -> 16314.28s]  on my browser source
[16318.89s -> 16320.89s]  Wait a minute this this needs to be explored
[16325.04s -> 16326.40s]  vlog
[16326.40s -> 16329.58s]  overwatch
[16329.58s -> 16331.82s]  Is this a muselk video?
[16336.22s -> 16338.94s]  Why is this here?
[16338.94s -> 16341.95s]  I didn't do this
[16342.43s -> 16346.75s]  Out of the water. I mean, I didn't do this. I didn't put this here
[16346.91s -> 16350.11s]  You know like will the game I swear to god, I don't know why this is here
[16350.59s -> 16355.31s]  You go in and it's just like can you click on people and that decides whether or not you're gonna win the game or not
[16355.39s -> 16360.35s]  Is this like part of a playlist of a video that we watched yesterday? So addictive so fun. It has to be right
[16360.43s -> 16363.55s]  I mean like i'm like trembling right now. It was just it was insane
[16363.55s -> 16366.59s]  It was just awesome and I can't wait to get a chance to play it again
[16366.99s -> 16370.43s]  Uh, there was this one thing I have no way. Well, there's muselk. I don't know why this is here
[16378.35s -> 16380.99s]  I have no explanation for that. I can't even tell you why that may have happened
[16381.55s -> 16384.35s]  Is this a setup for a joke? No, I have no idea why that happened
[16384.35s -> 16388.11s]  It was just my I went over to the my ending scene. I turned my audio on
[16388.67s -> 16390.67s]  And it was in the middle of a video
[16391.56s -> 16393.64s]  Probably a second or third or fourth video
[16394.36s -> 16398.20s]  Or maybe even like a 100th video that just was playing recommended over and over again all stream
[16398.76s -> 16401.84s]  I had my I don't know that could have been happening
[16405.48s -> 16412.09s]  It's very possible that this browser source was just playing videos in the background. Whatever
[16412.57s -> 16418.30s]  All right. I will see you guys on monday. You want who should we raid? Let's raid somebody who's available right now
[16418.86s -> 16421.39s]  Who's available and what are they doing? It's very important
[16426.36s -> 16428.36s]  Star's playing heart stone
[16433.20s -> 16436.08s]  Yeah, let's go say hi to star we actually were just talking the other day
[16438.32s -> 16442.16s]  Great star
[16442.16s -> 16446.64s]  It's very rare that I actually catch him streaming. He's probably gonna be he's probably gonna be like mad
[16447.20s -> 16448.96s]  And they just can't
[16448.96s -> 16450.56s]  All right, be nice
[16450.56s -> 16455.55s]  We're done. We'll do
[16455.55s -> 16457.55s]  I'll see you guys on monday. Have a great weekend
[16457.95s -> 16464.38s]  The bio you were talking about streaming together. Yeah, we we were talking about these games to play
[16467.24s -> 16469.24s]  I'll see you guys on monday
[16471.68s -> 16479.10s]  Please criticize every move he does in hearthstone tonight end
