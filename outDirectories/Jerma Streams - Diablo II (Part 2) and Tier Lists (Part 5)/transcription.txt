[1.59s -> 7.14s]  Yeah, I'm addicted to Diablo 2. I know. I said last night, I'm like, I don't think I'm gonna be
[7.14s -> 13.43s]  doing Diablo tomorrow. Maybe just 10 hours and like, yeah, maybe we'll do something. Well,
[13.43s -> 20.22s]  no, I'm addicted to Diablo 2. This is hardcore still. I talked to Joel. We've decided we're gonna
[20.22s -> 29.70s]  talk about tomorrow is the day for bomb defusal. Just one more, I can stop. Yeah, when it turned
[29.70s -> 33.78s]  out that tomorrow was gonna be the day, I was like, all right, fine. We'll just do Diablo again.
[34.50s -> 41.62s]  But it's been tomorrow for two weeks. Yes, it has. It's been tomorrow since January
[42.58s -> 48.34s]  third. It's all good. It's okay. It's probably gonna happen tomorrow. Will it? I don't know.
[48.34s -> 56.15s]  Something happens. Shit happens. It's okay. But since I stayed alive last night, I was thinking
[56.15s -> 62.23s]  about it. Like, yeah, it's whatever. But those of you that are like, I'm not really into Diablo.
[62.23s -> 67.99s]  That's all right. That's okay. You don't have to be into everything we do here. But every five
[67.99s -> 78.36s]  levels, I'm going to do a tier list. I have 14 of them. Tier lists we have not done. So every
[78.36s -> 85.13s]  probably every like 30 or every like 30 minutes or so, there's gonna be another tier list. All
[85.13s -> 94.20s]  right. Well, then looks like I'm gonna have to watch if you're gonna do tier lists. We're going
[94.20s -> 99.64s]  full on double variety stream today. Every stream is a variety stream here.
[103.22s -> 111.29s]  Do one to start things off. All right, I could I could we could start one off with an easy one.
[111.29s -> 123.50s]  We're targeting all audiences with this one here. I hate variety. But yeah, the plan is tomorrow to
[123.50s -> 129.16s]  do keep talking and nobody explodes. That'd be funny if we've been doing this for this long and
[129.16s -> 133.86s]  saying, Hey, we'll do it again. We'll do it again. And we just play a different game. We just do a
[133.86s -> 146.63s]  different co-op game tomorrow. Am I going to play Temtem? I don't think so. I don't think I'm
[146.63s -> 163.03s]  gonna play Temtem. Oh, Freddy. Freddy. Freddy Dread. Yeah, it didn't even show up on the screen
[163.03s -> 168.87s]  because I'm on my intro screen. But that was $200 from Freddy. 20,000 bits from Freddy Dread.
[170.38s -> 179.05s]  Welcome back again, Freddy. Thanks for your insane contributions. And yes, this is Freddy Dread. Yes,
[179.61s -> 188.47s]  this is this is the real Freddy Dread. Some of you guys like it. No. Oh, yes, it is a real one.
[189.03s -> 199.69s]  They say, German, I'm in Vegas for my first time in five days. Oh, hey, dude, I've been in Vegas for
[199.69s -> 204.41s]  the first time since last week. I'm in Vegas for the first time for five days. Please suggest
[204.41s -> 214.66s]  something I should do or see. Well, do I've got something for you to do. I have a very, very
[214.66s -> 222.34s]  special place that you should go to. It is a restaurant. It is... Finish the sentence, guys.
[223.06s -> 235.19s]  It's in the... Where is it? You guys all know. Where is it? It's in the... Do you guys not know?
[236.39s -> 241.83s]  No, it's not in the link. Thank you. It's in the link. It's a restaurant. It's my favorite restaurant
[241.83s -> 249.90s]  in Vegas. It is Hash House at GoGo. Go to the one in the link. Oh, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[249.90s -> 257.98s]  whoa, whoa. Not the link in the description, the link on the strip. And if you like blue cheese,
[257.98s -> 263.58s]  get the blue cheese burger. It's right up there on their favorites on the menu. It's a huge burger,
[263.58s -> 269.98s]  double patty, thin, delicious, juicy patties. You've got to go to Hash House at GoGo and tell
[269.98s -> 276.06s]  them German985 sent you. The four of you that have done that so far. And when you say that,
[276.06s -> 279.66s]  they're not going to know who the fuck I am or what you're talking about. They're just going
[279.66s -> 290.68s]  to think you're a strange person and you're going to get charged extra. No, but for real,
[290.68s -> 300.47s]  Freddie, thanks for the... What are you doing in Vegas? What are you doing in Vegas? The German
[300.47s -> 324.39s]  fan tax. He's in Vegas doing his best. They will be like that guy who was eating tuna from a can
[324.39s -> 335.06s]  with his bare hands. Probably performing. That's pretty sick. You're here for five days? I might
[335.06s -> 344.58s]  have to... I tried to read it. Any news on keep talking? Yep. Tomorrow. It's always tomorrow.
[344.58s -> 352.63s]  It's always tomorrow until it doesn't happen, right? But that's a shitload of money to start
[352.63s -> 357.82s]  the stream off. Thanks a lot, Freddie. Have fun in Vegas. Besides eating, oh my God, I did another...
[358.46s -> 364.66s]  I knocked the same battery over on my desk every time. I have this exact same pattern where I go
[364.66s -> 372.34s]  like this with my hands. When I talk... So when I talk... You guys can't even see this. Nevermind.
[374.34s -> 384.09s]  Actually, yeah, you can. So when I talk, I use my hands. If you're standing in a vicinity around me,
[385.13s -> 389.61s]  just watch out because I go fucking all over the place. I'm like, let me tell you this.
[390.89s -> 397.21s]  The thing is... And people just think I'm nuts. But anyways, I do the same motion. I go out and
[397.21s -> 403.85s]  I go to the left. So I go to talk that way and then bang into the left. I do that forward and
[403.85s -> 410.36s]  left and I knock down stuff on my desk all the time. And you can do... Your hair looks weird today.
[411.32s -> 416.55s]  You know, I told myself that I was going to stop reading out one negative comment that I see in
[416.55s -> 425.19s]  my chat rooms. I'm supposed to be doing that anymore. Anyways, yeah, I talk with my hands a
[425.19s -> 430.71s]  lot. So just... Now I'm realizing why people stand so far away from me when I'm talking.
[431.83s -> 434.87s]  I'm just figuring this out. No, this is... When I talk to somebody, they usually
[435.43s -> 438.79s]  like at least seven feet away from me and they keep going like this. What does this mean?
[439.83s -> 466.22s]  What's that mean? Why are they doing that? Because you're a spit talker. Yeah, no, I'm not.
[467.18s -> 470.14s]  Anyways, so we're going to start... You want to do a tier list first?
[470.78s -> 478.41s]  Is that what you guys want to do? Is that the plan? We start off with a tier list? All right,
[478.41s -> 486.63s]  we'll get one out of the way. All right, the first one I'm going to do is... Let me move this over
[486.63s -> 495.21s]  here. First tier list is a lot here. All right, we're going to do... We'll do pet reptiles for
[495.21s -> 505.74s]  the first one. That sounds pretty good. Pet reptiles. I'm going to be a little smaller
[506.70s -> 518.82s]  so you can see all the reptiles. Okay, pet reptiles. Tier lists. Well, can I even do... Can
[518.82s -> 523.14s]  I do this tier list if I've never had a pet reptile before? It comes in my eye. Can you see it? What
[523.14s -> 532.63s]  is it? In this eye right here. It's wicked blurry. What's in it? That was weird. All my vision was
[532.63s -> 537.75s]  just blocked by like a floating thing. All right, a pimple in your eye. No. All right, can I do a
[537.75s -> 545.21s]  reptile tier list if I've never had a reptile before? Can I do this? Well, how about this is
[545.21s -> 553.37s]  just like what I would want as a reptile owner? No, I can't. No, no. So hold on. If I've never...
[553.37s -> 559.22s]  That doesn't make any sense. No, I'm doing it. I don't care. All right, turtles. For pets or...
[559.22s -> 566.39s]  I'm going to use this as like what I think is coolest or what I'd want. Unfortunately,
[566.39s -> 575.34s]  turtles are cool, but I don't know if I'd really want one. What is this thing? I don't know what
[575.34s -> 594.47s]  that is. These are all snakes. Where's the huge dragon? There we go. But that's a... Okay,
[595.11s -> 603.34s]  wait, that's a giant tortoise. That's kind of cool actually. I don't want a snake. They're cool,
[603.34s -> 608.10s]  but I don't want one. Bearded dragon? That's what I want. I want a bearded dragon probably the most
[608.66s -> 621.45s]  or a huge lizard that eats its own room. Yeah, I know the names. I've watched the reptile guy
[621.45s -> 627.54s]  and I know what these are. They're like the best geckos. Crested skull geckos. What are they called?
[628.70s -> 632.22s]  Crested geckos? Crested geckos? I knew. See, I knew it. I knew what I was talking about.
[633.70s -> 643.91s]  These are supposed to be the best geckos. Is this a chameleon? Chameleons seem kind of fragile to
[643.91s -> 648.07s]  me. I don't think I'd want one as a pet. They're really interesting animals, but they feel fragile.
[648.07s -> 651.19s]  I feel like I would hurt it or something. You know what I mean? Like they just have these little
[651.19s -> 657.83s]  arms and I feel I wouldn't want to handle... I would want to just have them to enjoy viewing.
[659.22s -> 663.78s]  They're pretty fragile. Yeah, I just don't... I wouldn't want to potentially do any harm.
[664.42s -> 676.94s]  Um, we got a snake. What's with the turtles? There's too many turtles and too many snakes
[676.94s -> 685.70s]  on this list. What is that? This is skateboard. That's not even... That's not... That shouldn't
[685.70s -> 697.88s]  be on the list. I don't know what this is either. This is a leopard gecko. Those are pretty cool.
[697.88s -> 715.93s]  I like them. All right, let me refine this. Big tortoise is cool, but I feel like they take big
[715.93s -> 720.71s]  dumps. I don't know if that would want one. Oh, this thing takes big dumps too.
[729.21s -> 745.24s]  Okay, that's all right. Would I rather have a snake or a turtle? Where's the ball python? Right
[745.24s -> 751.61s]  here, right? This is a ball python, isn't it? Or is it this? Ball python? No, which one's a ball
[751.61s -> 761.75s]  python? This brown one here? I mean, I really don't... I don't know. Is this an iguana or
[761.75s -> 769.35s]  something? I don't know what these are. Turtles are a pain to take care of. I've never had one.
[769.91s -> 774.94s]  I don't know what these are though. I feel like if I don't know what it is, it shouldn't be this
[774.94s -> 786.09s]  high up on a list. I'd probably... But no, but if you have a snake, you have to feed a snake
[787.46s -> 801.14s]  mice, don't you? Remember, what's with the title and category? What? This is Diablo 2. We're playing
[801.14s -> 809.13s]  Diablo 2. Diablo 2 looking... Yeah, this is just starting the stream. Diablo 2. See, look at the
[809.13s -> 819.30s]  background. It's coming up. All right, I think this is accurate. What's with the quality of the start
[819.30s -> 837.94s]  of this stream? You mean high quality? That's what they meant. Cool. Big ass cup here. Look at
[837.94s -> 850.65s]  this thing. Isn't this too big? There's like 16 ounces of liquid in here. Why do they make them
[850.65s -> 860.33s]  like this? It's such a thick outside and they make it huge. All right, sick. That's a normal size cup.
[860.33s -> 875.74s]  Yeah, I think this is accurate. Why did you buy it? Because it fucking looked neat to me. I didn't
[875.74s -> 892.20s]  buy it. I'm drinking out of Kim's cup today. You're a thief. Yeah. All right. All right,
[892.20s -> 900.44s]  that's it. Bearded dragon. I want a big tegu, is that called? Or I don't... Tegu's the best
[900.44s -> 906.81s]  big monitor style lizards, right? Yeah, crested gecko. This is an accurate list.
[907.53s -> 914.68s]  He's awesome and I don't want a skateboard. Cool. Hey, you know what time it is now? Diablo 2.
[930.98s -> 941.18s]  Let's go. Dude, how the fuck are you guys? Welcome to Act 3. Where are the bone friends? By the way,
[941.18s -> 950.10s]  take a look at this. I did some work. I've been working. I made this much easier for you guys.
[950.98s -> 956.18s]  If you take a look at what happens, take a look at this shit. Ready? Bingo. Now look at not only
[956.18s -> 961.46s]  do we have accurate stats and everything, you can see how many points are in it and you don't have
[961.46s -> 966.58s]  to pick the category. You can just click on the one you want. For instance, like here we are
[966.58s -> 972.31s]  banging. Now there's two. I can take that away. Look at that. We don't have to spend so much time
[972.31s -> 984.33s]  doing this anymore and check it. We come right back here. Bingo. Done. What the hell does that
[984.33s -> 995.26s]  even mean? I missed. Oh, you missed the last stream. Oh yeah. Okay. So how this works? No,
[995.26s -> 1003.29s]  everyone knows. Let's get our spaghetti. Um, eat some monster here. What was the last thing I did?
[1003.85s -> 1007.69s]  Didn't want to kill on Dario again. I'm so addicted to this. I wanted to play it so bad after
[1007.69s -> 1012.84s]  streaming that I went to bed immediately because I knew I wanted to wake up early to play it again.
[1012.84s -> 1016.33s]  Where are the skeletons? Well, I have to kill something to get a skeleton. We need to win
[1016.33s -> 1024.94s]  admission first. They don't know. All right. How does it work? Let me explain. So, uh, you level
[1024.94s -> 1030.17s]  up in this game with an experience bar. What do you fucking do? Okay. So you level up with an
[1030.17s -> 1035.75s]  experience bar. When we level up, we're going to get five stat points to put into these. And
[1035.75s -> 1043.67s]  I have 50 strength as a necromancer, which is, it's a little odd this early. 75 vitality. The
[1043.67s -> 1048.76s]  chat has been picking these. These are skill points, right? So the images that you're seeing
[1048.76s -> 1055.58s]  here are all laid out across here. Before yesterday, we were picking categories first,
[1055.58s -> 1059.54s]  and that was sort of a pain in the ass. So I figured just dump the whole thing out,
[1059.54s -> 1064.07s]  stop blaming chat. And this is what chat has selected so far. Uh, they, they really like
[1064.07s -> 1070.76s]  skeleton friends, but they don't like giving me any offensive abilities. So I'm forced,
[1070.76s -> 1077.48s]  unfortunately, to walk around with an axe and swing at it with a bunch of strength.
[1077.48s -> 1082.36s]  So, and not only that, they've been incredibly indecisive at what they want to do here
[1082.36s -> 1087.48s]  because look, we have points in skeleton, we have points in skeletal mage, skeleton mastery,
[1087.48s -> 1093.10s]  but also we're going multiple points down here into golems and golem mastery. They're not really
[1093.10s -> 1102.90s]  sure what they want to do. He's mad about this. No, I think it's fun. What are the skeleton's names?
[1102.90s -> 1121.26s]  Okay. So there's seven. So it's Laffy, Daffy, Sleepy, Snoozy, um, Grumpy, Hungry, and Ed,
[1121.26s -> 1141.82s]  whatever they are. Got Donkey? That's Shrek. All right. Well, let's get some skeletons.
[1141.82s -> 1152.01s]  Hungry? Really? What's wrong with Hungry? You missed the dark wanderer. No, I didn't. I knew
[1152.01s -> 1157.86s]  he turns into the slugs. All right. We didn't even get that. No, no, we got to talk to, um,
[1157.86s -> 1165.10s]  no, we don't. You act free sucks. Let's just be real. How long is the stream going to be today?
[1165.10s -> 1176.94s]  As long as until I'm satisfied. So he's very long. Yesterday. I was not satisfied for a long
[1176.94s -> 1191.00s]  time. Here we go. Here's our friends. Oh yeah. So actually it's 10 people both fight in Dariel
[1191.00s -> 1195.32s]  till you get a unique, but I got to make some progress first because act three really is such
[1195.32s -> 1198.84s]  a pain in the ass. And then we get to do act four, which is the best act in the game.
[1200.92s -> 1210.04s]  You started catching your streams live playing Minecraft. It's the dream. Well, welcome.
[1211.00s -> 1218.18s]  Oh, don't you have to find the weapon? Yeah, you got, I got to find a weapon out here.
[1218.18s -> 1228.20s]  The random event. How many players? Uh, five setting the players to five. You can say I'm
[1228.20s -> 1232.68s]  in single player because it doesn't have one yesterday. I got my account up and, um, I don't
[1232.68s -> 1239.16s]  know why it did. So, uh, I have a band fucking battle net account and I have to play in single
[1239.16s -> 1242.12s]  player. This is hardcore. If I die, it's over and I can't get this character back.
[1243.08s -> 1251.88s]  Uh, but when I do players, I can set the game to be harder. So the game thinks there's five
[1251.88s -> 1267.53s]  people in the game right now. So everything's hard. I think I already found it. Oh, how would I?
[1269.45s -> 1273.93s]  Oh yes. And by the way, every, uh, every 30 or 40 minutes, we're going to do another tier list.
[1275.05s -> 1290.68s]  We're doing a double here. What did I say? Every, every like, every like five levels,
[1291.40s -> 1301.96s]  there's so much poison in acts two and three. Yeah, there is. He's going to forget. No, what
[1301.96s -> 1309.75s]  the stream has been live for 20 minutes. So at minute number, let's see. So when did I,
[1309.75s -> 1319.13s]  what 10 minutes ago did I start? When did I run out here? All right. We need to find the spider.
[1320.33s -> 1325.05s]  The thing about act three is you have to find member of the cube and the staff and all that
[1325.05s -> 1330.65s]  bullshit in act two. Well, they decided that they wanted to do that, but make it add like three more
[1330.65s -> 1337.19s]  items to find. So we have to find the heart, the brain, the guts, the blood that we've got to find
[1337.19s -> 1343.56s]  so much shit and make this giant flail, which then lets us go to Mephisto's lair. We never played
[1343.56s -> 1360.81s]  this before and there's nothing over here. That's a spoiler. That's okay. Imagine explaining that all
[1360.81s -> 1366.89s]  to a boomer. Well, if you were, if you're a boomer, you may have played this game already.
[1368.97s -> 1374.73s]  Something that a boomer might know more than you guys right now is the necromancer skill tree.
[1374.73s -> 1390.18s]  All right. We can, we're not going over there. Oh fuck. I forgot about this. Damn it. It upgrades
[1390.18s -> 1398.52s]  the gem that's in your inventory. God damn it. I've ruined it. That gem shrine. If you bring any gem,
[1398.52s -> 1402.12s]  it upgrades it immediately. If it's in your inventory to the next higher quality,
[1402.12s -> 1407.85s]  I could have just made like a flawless. I'm just going to, I think I've probably restarted the whole
[1407.85s -> 1416.84s]  thing. Yeah. I'll restart from scratch. All right. Well, where do I, where the hell am I going?
[1416.84s -> 1426.95s]  Looking for the spider cavern. Ooh. Oh, that wasn't even a good one. You're saved scumming.
[1430.01s -> 1439.85s]  I'm not saved scumming. That was a stunted room. Here we go. There's a well up here. Thank God.
[1444.31s -> 1453.54s]  Ah, that's some good sight here. Make the top corner of all different face cams of you.
[1454.98s -> 1459.86s]  If people wanted me to do that yesterday, but that's, I feel like that's going to get old real
[1459.86s -> 1495.82s]  quick. That's, you know, that's going to get old very quickly. Do it. All right. Um, it's going to
[1495.82s -> 1524.79s]  take a long time. I got to go in a place that's safe. Okay. There we go. I'm safe here, right?
[1525.59s -> 1558.57s]  This is going to fucking break my computer and I'm going to delay them too. So when I move around,
[1559.53s -> 1588.41s]  this actually might fuck up the computer though. That's not, why is that not working?
[1594.50s -> 1600.66s]  No, I can't. It can only be one source. It can only be one source. It can't happen.
[1601.38s -> 1606.02s]  Just, I, I get, I'm going to have to like invert the colors and move them around. I can't delay them.
[1606.02s -> 1611.45s]  It has to be different cameras because these are, these are technically a copy
[1612.41s -> 1627.27s]  because now it's going to do it all of them. Yeah. Watch this. Ready? I can't. It's still connected.
[1628.23s -> 1645.11s]  Sorry guys. We tried. I need like six cameras. Worth a shot. Yeah. I can't do them individually.
[1646.15s -> 1669.64s]  Go get, go get six cameras. What did I do? I just became the green goblin.
[1670.52s -> 1699.98s]  Which one of these is real? All right. Get rid of this one. I'm still alive, right? No,
[1700.06s -> 1714.25s]  no, I'm playing Diablo 2 now. That's weird. You look sick. I look like I'm about to puke.
[1716.84s -> 1737.34s]  Cartoon. Hold on. Oh, wait. Hold on. Wait. We need that music.
[1738.14s -> 1740.70s]  Wait, wait, wait. We need, hold on. We need that music to play.
[1741.66s -> 1765.67s]  Someone that's like, what was it called? No, no, no. It's longer than this. Isn't it?
[1765.67s -> 1779.66s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. How old is this?
[1780.54s -> 1783.72s]  It's a little, two days maybe.
[1801.46s -> 1825.38s]  Can I play Diablo 2 now, please? I don't, I, I don't know what to tell you. I don't understand.
[1825.38s -> 1832.10s]  I don't, okay. I'm playing the game now. I'm going to play the game. That was not, not even close.
[1832.10s -> 1843.62s]  Wait, I want to see that. Show it to me. Show it to me. I need to see what I, I need to see what
[1843.62s -> 1868.17s]  I've done. I need to see that. Please show me. Please. Don't show them. Show me. It wasn't that
[1868.17s -> 1874.30s]  bad. It was, it was kind of humorous. No one clipped it because no one thought it was funny.
[1875.24s -> 1879.21s]  Oh, really? Nobody thought it was funny?
[1886.07s -> 1918.49s]  If I die right now in hardcore, if I can trap somewhere. God damn it. All right, here we go.
[1919.29s -> 1928.94s]  A necromancer. What am I looking for? Stony field or something? I think my girlfriend's cheating on
[1928.94s -> 1935.74s]  her husband. What do I do? Um, I don't think it's going to, I don't think it's going to work out.
[1936.70s -> 1950.79s]  Um, why did I read that? Because it was the first thing that my brain looked at.
[1951.59s -> 1960.50s]  All right, come on. We need spider caverns. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it.
[1961.78s -> 1981.72s]  Why are we all spread out? Everyone join together. Wait, I need the, uh, the permanent stat point.
[1982.65s -> 1996.26s]  Do another joke, E-clown. How about you sit down? You've been standing this whole time.
[2004.58s -> 2009.06s]  You were waiting for an opportunity to point and scream during a lull in the, uh, in the,
[2009.06s -> 2009.94s]  in the performance here.
[2022.54s -> 2028.86s]  You bring a potion to this guy and he gives you stat increases. Stop reading chat messages. A
[2028.86s -> 2058.12s]  red spy is in the base. What? I had to breathe halfway through that because I went right into
[2058.12s -> 2064.20s]  it. So that's why it stopped when it went that fast. I had to breathe. All right, get in here.
[2064.20s -> 2072.46s]  Let's go. Big fight. Big fight. Can't just drop a track like that without warning.
[2073.26s -> 2080.79s]  I was about to turn the fucking cam on. He puked green and played sound again.
[2081.51s -> 2088.78s]  After every fucking bad thing that happens, I'm going to do that.
[2088.78s -> 2094.12s]  And I'm going to see how long it takes for a thousand people to leave. Found it.
[2101.80s -> 2104.36s]  If more people leave from Bugleberry than they do from that,
[2105.78s -> 2108.26s]  then Bugleberry really might need to retire as a hero.
[2109.86s -> 2120.54s]  Oh shit, need mages. I'm kidding. Why would I ever retire Bugleberry? The best character ever.
[2121.50s -> 2131.82s]  Is there a unique here? All right, we're looking for the eyes or the brain? What's in the cavern?
[2139.40s -> 2143.48s]  I forgot to look at all these potions. This is a joke.
[2147.88s -> 2150.17s]  13 to life. They're getting rid of these.
[2158.36s -> 2165.80s]  Still keep that. That's good. Add. Add. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Only big
[2165.80s -> 2181.80s]  potions. Uh, I wish I had a bigger belt. What keys do I have? Get rid of that. Get rid of, uh,
[2181.80s -> 2187.72s]  all right. Put these here. I'm sorry for backups. Get rid of that. Okay. Oh, I got six. One.
[2189.08s -> 2192.62s]  He's still... Why is he playing a normie build?
[2197.06s -> 2205.50s]  Is the title of my stream working? Is the title of the stream working? Hello? Hello? Is the title
[2205.50s -> 2223.00s]  working? I didn't pick any of this. Why did he pick a normie build? Hello? Are you calling Bugleberry
[2223.00s -> 2234.14s]  a bad character? No. Now he's mad. No, he's not. He's fucking glad. Bugleberry emote? Yeah, and
[2234.14s -> 2239.98s]  it's going to be 12 slots. I'm going to ruin my chat. All right, let's go get that side.
[2240.54s -> 2248.22s]  And it's going to be a screen cap of when he goes...
[2249.99s -> 2272.54s]  Oh! It's going to be like Bugleberry 01 through 12. Oh, he's got something there. H22. Yep.
[2288.23s -> 2294.71s]  Yeah. All right. How many slots do I have? Well, there goes... There's your April Fool's joke,
[2294.71s -> 2311.88s]  guys. It's going to be like 35 slots or like 38 slots. Oh, I don't know about that. I'm going to
[2311.88s -> 2321.51s]  have to get rid of it immediately though, because that would be a disaster because people would be
[2321.51s -> 2326.63s]  doing that and other people's streams and shit. And nobody wants like a 50 slot emote destroying
[2326.63s -> 2343.50s]  their whole chat room. I'm not going to... I don't want to be responsible for that one. Unleash the
[2343.50s -> 2351.10s]  plague. No. It's so bad. Hey, you want to know the quickest way to make a bunch of people hate
[2351.10s -> 2360.66s]  your guts? Ruin their stream with a 50 slot emote that people spam. What's this guy with
[2360.66s -> 2370.22s]  the mask on in the chat? What's this? Can we fucking take care of that? That's it. And now do
[2370.22s -> 2383.46s]  that across 5,000 channels. What the fuck is that? Jerma? Fucking stupid, man. That's it. That's it.
[2383.46s -> 2391.24s]  It's not going to be like, oh, that was funny. Fucking Jerma. Who the fuck's that?
[2392.63s -> 2410.63s]  Fucking dick. Holy shit. That was a big chest. Flawed diamond. Always pick up the diamonds.
[2410.63s -> 2423.02s]  Anything else? And then that person then goes into their Discord and gets in a group with a
[2423.02s -> 2428.97s]  couple of friends, other streamers or something. You guys see this like Jerma, bugleberry emote
[2428.97s -> 2435.21s]  thing? Yeah. Yeah. Who's this fucking guy? I think he is. That's funny, dude. You could like
[2435.21s -> 2441.06s]  take over a whole channel with that. That's funny. Imagine the fucking, imagine the fucking
[2441.06s -> 2455.35s]  what kind of person you got to be to do that. That's so funny, dude. Yeah. And I got it. And
[2455.35s -> 2460.47s]  by the way, that happened. No, no, no. Seriously, that's such fucking bullshit. I just got an ace
[2460.47s -> 2465.51s]  in CSGO when it happened too. And that's in the dead people where I just ruined everything.
[2467.91s -> 2471.99s]  I had to turn away from the computer, take the middle of it and ban a bunch of people and shit,
[2471.99s -> 2483.27s]  man. Who should fucking do something about that? I can't believe I still haven't found this thing.
[2491.51s -> 2497.59s]  Why do all the streamers sound like the E3 actual gameplay fake voice chat?
[2507.42s -> 2525.32s]  I don't know. That's pretty good. Come on, give me some, give me some unique.
[2531.13s -> 2543.82s]  F-rude. Are we missing anybody? I'm, I'm, I don't even, I'm missing like six people. I wish I had a
[2543.82s -> 2551.10s]  move instead of just D. This is guys. If you come to a Diablo two stream and you see the arrow
[2551.10s -> 2562.90s]  pointing down here on the left mouse click some, Hey dude, somebody help this guy. Omega low. Look
[2562.90s -> 2580.33s]  omega low, omega low. What is it? Halo and the Nancy Drew game were among the most popular
[2580.41s -> 2600.47s]  Steam games in December. No way. There's no way. No fucking way. What? I can't believe it. How?
[2601.03s -> 2623.80s]  Do we have a source on this? Hold on a second. This is PC gamer. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[2624.60s -> 2646.82s]  Okay. Hold on. I have to read this. I don't fucking believe this. I really don't. No, wrong thing.
[2646.82s -> 2676.01s]  Where is it? Why can I capture this? Horn tabs. Yeah. No. Okay. Here we go.
[2681.59s -> 2706.10s]  Halo. I can't fucking believe this. This is going to be fucked up for a second. We need to read this.
[2707.30s -> 2722.70s]  Okay. This has to be a joke. No, it's not. Red Dead. Okay. Valve has posted a list of the most
[2722.70s -> 2727.18s]  successful Steam releases in December. And as usual, it's a mix of the expected. Halo,
[2727.18s -> 2734.49s]  Red Dead Redemption 2 and surprising Nancy Drew Midnight in Salem. VR Paradise Gentleman's Club.
[2734.49s -> 2738.49s]  The list isn't ordered. So we don't know which among these sold best, but it's testament to
[2738.49s -> 2744.30s]  the wide range of games available on the platform. The list is determined by the amount of revenue
[2744.30s -> 2757.21s]  generated during the first fortnight of each game's launch. No, no, this is not this. This
[2757.21s -> 2774.28s]  is not us. This is a popular franchise. This has nothing to do with us. Even the screenshot though
[2774.28s -> 2785.03s]  is no, there's no way. It's probably just really popular. I don't, I have no fucking idea, man.
[2793.34s -> 2804.76s]  Don't ask me. All right. Anyways, weird shit today. Huh? Weird shit today.
[2805.64s -> 2815.98s]  I guess I'm real weird shit going on. Nobody else even streams that game, but don't people
[2815.98s -> 2827.02s]  buy that game? Is the Drew crew really that large? It can't be. I talked a lot of shit too. I said
[2827.02s -> 2832.30s]  there wasn't enough people on the Drew crew to even make a whole baseball team and it was the
[2832.30s -> 2840.42s]  second most revenue generating game on steam. Uh, reverse it. They're the ones in the stadium.
[2845.24s -> 2857.05s]  They weren't ordered. So you're telling me that VR Gentleman's Club could be more popular. Is this
[2857.05s -> 2862.97s]  even the right place to get the item? It's not. No, it's not. I'm not, I'm in the wrong place.
[2863.77s -> 2876.44s]  Yeah, I'm in the wrong place. It's the spider cavern, not the arachnid lair.
[2878.15s -> 2884.66s]  Jeremy, how many copies did I buy? I mean, I bought like 20 Nancy Drew games or something.
[2885.54s -> 2903.77s]  It's guaranteed top 20. Spider cavern, spider cavern. Oh, here's the waypoint. Literally just
[2903.77s -> 2917.74s]  you. You made it make millions of dollars. That would be something, wouldn't it? Not in the right
[2917.74s -> 2933.58s]  place. Apologize. What's this link? Nancy Drew midnight in Salem. All time peak 800.
[2934.46s -> 2947.91s]  How much is, how much is midnight in Salem? How much is midnight in Salem?
[2948.71s -> 2974.76s]  $20 was 800 times 20, about $1,600. That's not 1600. It's like, it's like 20 grand.
[2977.21s -> 2979.29s]  A lot of y'all getting that wrong.
[2982.01s -> 2987.37s]  And people, what people make fun of my math. A lot of y'all getting that wrong.
[2987.61s -> 2993.59s]  That's my favorite comment in the chat. All right, so let's just assume that 800 people bought it.
[2994.31s -> 3001.86s]  There's no way 800 of you guys bought that game during that, during those streams. No way.
[3003.54s -> 3015.11s]  I would assume maybe like six of you. Not a thousand. We all bought it. Teenagers play
[3015.11s -> 3034.90s]  video games too. That's what I'm saying. I think this is just a weird coincidence.
[3035.62s -> 3039.22s]  I don't think this means anything. It's very odd, but I don't think it means anything.
[3039.22s -> 3062.71s]  All right. Well, the next time I get approached by a brand and they say, Hey, Mr. Albertson,
[3062.71s -> 3066.31s]  we just want to know we're just so we can be confident that you could potentially help us
[3066.31s -> 3072.78s]  out with talking about our product. Do you have any, any kind of experience? And I'll just link
[3072.78s -> 3080.42s]  them this article and go fucking Nancy Drew was top 20 on steam. Nancy Drew was, and they'll go,
[3080.50s -> 3112.46s]  Holy shit. If this guy can sell Nancy Drew, he can sell any. You're a Scientologist.
[3114.10s -> 3131.93s]  What the hell are you talking about? Look at how big this forest is. Missing a mage. We need to
[3131.93s -> 3146.39s]  have a full stack of friends. Otherwise it's not worth it. Ring sucks. Charm. I'm sorry. Now it's
[3146.39s -> 3153.02s]  stuck. Somebody, uh, no, I'm not, I'm not going to influence chat. Somebody, somebody said,
[3153.18s -> 3157.10s]  we're doing this all wrong and I'm not going to influence chat, but we're doing it all wrong.
[3157.10s -> 3162.22s]  Just want to make sure everyone's aware of that. All wrong. All of it. Wrong. All wrong.
[3166.07s -> 3183.85s]  Now what? Nancy Drew is now the most played game in history of steam. And it's all
[3185.05s -> 3193.14s]  thanks to this wacky streamer. Yeah. I, I, you can, I can inspect and edit too.
[3202.82s -> 3209.64s]  Now this is all messed up. What happened to my skill tree? The Drew crew strikes again.
[3210.52s -> 3217.51s]  We go. Now I can see what the hell I'm doing. All right, let's go. He hates the joke. He can
[3217.51s -> 3235.90s]  inspect. He can edit. I'll get back to town as that only works on your parents. You know, you,
[3235.90s -> 3243.48s]  you could, you could edit a page that says that you were nominated for best actor in a supporting
[3243.48s -> 3248.84s]  role and send it to your mom. And she'd be like, what's going, what's going on? What? I didn't know
[3248.84s -> 3255.83s]  you, you were an, wait, what? You're an actor. Who did this? I know because I did it one time.
[3258.33s -> 3271.40s]  She was like, what the heck? I'm just kidding. And then she got real sad. She was like, oh,
[3272.68s -> 3296.52s]  you asshole. Not doing it. Everyone has expected it. Didn't do it. Didn't do it.
[3296.52s -> 3303.88s]  Now everyone's pissed because I didn't do it. All right. Oh, what's this rune?
[3303.88s -> 3310.60s]  Do I already have one? No, I can, I can select every single rune, even Zed or Zod.
[3311.16s -> 3318.58s]  The hardest rune to find in the game. Zod. That shit used to go for like 30 SOJ. It was the most
[3318.58s -> 3326.38s]  expensive thing in the whole game. It was insane. It was impossible to find. It was part of so many
[3326.38s -> 3334.89s]  rune words. Some of the best rune words in the whole game were because of Zod. What was, what
[3334.89s -> 3355.46s]  was Enigma? What was the actual rune word? Listen to this nerd. Oh, that brings back memories.
[3358.46s -> 3371.46s]  Almost a level up. How many people did you scam? With Zod? I didn't. I never had a Zod. Some runes
[3371.46s -> 3381.69s]  you can't get outside a ladder. That's right. It's not fair. I can't get them. How's that fair?
[3381.69s -> 3386.09s]  You, you, you reserve some of the coolest stuff in the game for like the best players and the ones
[3386.09s -> 3401.32s]  that come on. It's not fair. Blizzard doesn't care. Why isn't the Harajuku in the inventory?
[3402.22s -> 3405.82s]  Because I don't, I don't like it. I don't like it being in my inventory because I like it to
[3405.82s -> 3413.61s]  be a clean inventory. I like having structure. I know. Yes, there's been 20 potions. That's
[3413.61s -> 3420.63s]  because my belt sucks and I need a better belt. Just stay tuned. It's about to get way cooler,
[3420.63s -> 3425.32s]  but it's a cube. I know. Uh, what do I, what do I want to do? I want to gamble. All right. What
[3425.32s -> 3430.81s]  do I have? What's the worst thing I have? Boots. I need better boots. It's boots or ring. Should
[3430.81s -> 3443.06s]  I buy a ring? I'm going for it. I'm going all in. I'm just going to buy a ring. Here we go.
[3443.06s -> 3447.38s]  Level one telekinesis. Too bad. That's not teleport. I thought it was teleport and I almost
[3447.38s -> 3485.05s]  shit my pants. Get a belt. My belt's okay. I need boots. Well, I'm out of money. So we just said
[3485.05s -> 3490.33s]  your belt was shit. Well, I mean, we're holding stuff. There's only two slots. You can have up
[3490.33s -> 3506.55s]  to, I believe five slots in some of the big belts, big heavy belts. I didn't do that though. So that's
[3506.55s -> 3521.90s]  false. You know what that means? It's time for some chat interaction.
[3535.22s -> 3546.79s]  Chat fix everything. Plate mail. Let me stop this blunt junk. We're about to go into the
[3546.79s -> 3559.40s]  marsh I think. Still in the forest. Somehow. Somehow we're still in the forest. I don't know how.
[3559.64s -> 3575.66s]  Player jungle. Yeah, I gotta go back. Unless if the waypoint's right here, that's good.
[3582.52s -> 3585.00s]  This is probably as close to a pacifist run as you can get in this game.
[3589.24s -> 3604.15s]  Second unique in the game. And it's probably going to go right to Vic. Yeah, unique, unique,
[3604.15s -> 3608.79s]  unique. I used to do this thing where I would, I'm kind of a psycho about this,
[3609.75s -> 3615.03s]  but I would hold on to uniques as long as I could and then do just a mass unveiling of what it was.
[3615.67s -> 3621.19s]  This is back when I didn't really know the game very well. It was so much fun. Especially with
[3621.19s -> 3624.71s]  rings. If you got like four or five rings and you're like, all right, which ring is it? Because the
[3624.71s -> 3641.42s]  ring could be, it's only, you know, there's so much variety. Let's go. Oh, that's, that's,
[3641.90s -> 3651.93s]  ah, it's good though. 10 strength, 35% chance to open wound. 10% HP per hit. This is going to
[3651.93s -> 3672.60s]  the Vic. 10% health stone per hit. He's never going to die. This guy's never going to die.
[3672.60s -> 3682.07s]  That's 10% HP. Kyle would have used it. Kyle can't even equip it. So no, he wouldn't have.
[3687.16s -> 3702.97s]  Got to fight the monster here. Champion rat man. Oh, I must just fucking, I thought it was another
[3702.97s -> 3717.22s]  one. We got the, uh, the good bin though. This is a quest at a lack. I get this shit out of here.
[3717.22s -> 3728.76s]  I have so much crap. My inventory is loaded with free up. Um, I can get them later. Put them down.
[3734.63s -> 3743.83s]  How big is this? Actually kind of normal attack. That's kind of good.
[3750.12s -> 3757.83s]  Come back for it. All right. Uh, return to the good bin to Ormus.
[3765.22s -> 3770.78s]  Ormus congratulates you. Old spirits of Skatsim will watch over you for returning.
[3770.78s -> 3779.42s]  Bro, why do you, you have a big what? Ormus will now once again use his powers to protect the
[3779.42s -> 3795.05s]  innocent from the shadow. Yes. Tearless now? Nope. This magic ring does me no good. Here, wear it
[3795.05s -> 3803.66s]  proudly. Okay. What is it? Well, thank you Ormus. That's not bad. Oh, but a hunter to
[3803.66s -> 3810.97s]  attack rating. Holy shit. That's really good actually. Hold resist, poison resist, dexterity.
[3811.53s -> 3813.69s]  Oh, we're going to get rid of, what are we getting? Yeah. Let's get rid of this.
[3814.65s -> 3829.30s]  333. That's a good number. That's a weird 33% number. All right. Let's, uh, let's, let's try out
[3829.30s -> 3843.90s]  our new technique to get the skills. Huh? What do you say? 16 to 37. Yeah. It's time to get rid of
[3843.90s -> 3853.08s]  this. How much strength do I need? Don't I have that? Wait. Oh, it's 54 strength. Why do I care
[3853.08s -> 3860.18s]  about strength? I don't, I don't want you to do 54 strength, whatever. All right. Uh, so first of all,
[3860.18s -> 3874.17s]  when you do this, you could do me a favor and, um, click on a stat that you want. If you click
[3874.17s -> 3877.53s]  on the screen, if you, if you have extensions enabled, you can click on the screen. If you
[3878.33s -> 3886.34s]  so inclined, which stat do I want to do? Did derma stay up all night? Yeah, dude. Yep.
[3886.34s -> 3912.20s]  How come I can't see it? That's why it looks like you guys want strength, strength, the gang.
[3919.78s -> 3935.50s]  Equally as important. Let's, um, whoops. Uh, would that go equally as important?
[3935.50s -> 3941.91s]  I'm going to actually put this, where am I going to put this fucking thing? All right. So as you see,
[3943.05s -> 3953.03s]  uh, here are what we have for points right now. Skeletal mage. You get left is summoning,
[3953.03s -> 3961.11s]  middle is bone, right is curse. Don't have to pick a, don't have to pick a category anymore.
[3961.11s -> 3976.97s]  Just what do you want me to do? What do you want the point to go? Interesting. Very interesting.
[3977.69s -> 4003.30s]  Interesting. Let me give this about two seconds. Iron golem it is. Thanks for voting.
[4007.96s -> 4015.19s]  And we're going to go like this and iron golem now has one point in it. And just in case you
[4015.19s -> 4027.22s]  needed to know, needed to see it over here. Here we go. Iron golem iron golem. You have to transform
[4027.22s -> 4034.62s]  a metal object. So you need something, a weapon or armor and, uh, takes on the properties of that
[4034.62s -> 4043.40s]  item. And then also it has thorns. So 150% of all damage it takes, it returns it back to the attacker.
[4047.50s -> 4062.90s]  So, um, so the axe now, what do I lose? I'll turn, I'll turn him, I'll make him from this.
[4063.54s -> 4074.76s]  Just hope he doesn't die. Oh no, this is not, it's no, no, no, I can't wear this. This is two-handed.
[4074.76s -> 4088.57s]  I lose two to gray skeleton. Nope. I thought it was one-handed. This is not made out of metal.
[4088.57s -> 4109.80s]  I mean, it's, it's, yes it is. This ring. Watch this. Ready? Check this out. Uh, does that work
[4109.80s -> 4124.70s]  on rings? I thought it worked on rings. There he is. And he's made out of a rare. So he's
[4124.70s -> 4135.75s]  fucking awesome. He gets all the properties from what we just did. Good luck taking this down.
[4135.75s -> 4145.94s]  Just don't exit the game for a while and don't get him killed. All right. Well, there's that quest.
[4145.94s -> 4157.03s]  Now we need to talk to Asherah. I think it's down here and then believe. No, that's probably, uh,
[4157.03s -> 4172.36s]  where's it? It will carry over when you leave the game. Pretty sick. Our armor. All right. The act
[4172.36s -> 4179.16s]  three, the act three mercenaries are awesome, but I don't want to lose, uh,
[4179.16s -> 4194.87s]  Vic. How many golems can you have? Only one. But the more points you put into golems, the more
[4195.91s -> 4201.16s]  powerful that that single one becomes to the point where it becomes its own character
[4201.24s -> 4212.79s]  that is unstoppable. All right. So now I can hire, I can hire, but I'm not going to get rid of Vic
[4212.79s -> 4229.05s]  because it's good. I like the aura. Okay. Quest completed. Now we just have to find this stupid
[4229.05s -> 4237.56s]  thing in the spider cavern. I'm going back to the waypoint. Spider forest, spider cavern. That's a
[4237.56s -> 4254.23s]  ractid lair, not the correct one. What are you shooting at? Do the gold birdie thing? Yeah,
[4254.23s -> 4259.24s]  but isn't that, that's a random drop though. The gold birdie quest is a random drop outside,
[4259.24s -> 4272.25s]  right? From a champion. Where the hell can I go this way to the left here? List waiting room.
[4274.20s -> 4281.29s]  I wish I had a ding, ding, ding ready. Like you're the first person to say that we were waiting for
[4281.29s -> 4300.44s]  somebody. So you won. You won. What was the name? What do they win? Many people have said that.
[4302.07s -> 4305.61s]  Well, that's the first one that I've noticed from, I thought it was another one.
[4306.92s -> 4317.88s]  Raul or Tao. I'm giving you your first rune word. Raul or Tao. Remember that one?
[4337.13s -> 4343.26s]  Now we're in the great marsh. Where is the spider cavern? That's my lightning resist. Pretty bad.
[4343.90s -> 4359.83s]  He kind of looks like a skeleton too, the waypoint. No, I don't want to be here.
[4360.47s -> 4372.17s]  I need to go into, I need to find the spider cavern. Can you get a McChicken? I don't know,
[4372.17s -> 4379.42s]  that depends. How far away is the McDonald's from where you live? You have a car. You have Uber Eats
[4379.42s -> 4389.66s]  available or one of those other apps. And you walk. I mean, are you in an area where I can just take
[4389.66s -> 4395.99s]  a walk, the sidewalk so I can get there. And you can figure it out. I can't help you there. I can't
[4395.99s -> 4410.25s]  be the one. I can't help you. There's not much more that I can do. Google.com. You live at
[4410.25s -> 4415.94s]  McDonald's. How do you guys say McDonald's? Do you guys say McDonald's or do you guys say like
[4415.94s -> 4427.94s]  McDonald's? McDonald's. McDonald's. Which one? You guys say McDonald's. McDonald's. McDonald's.
[4430.73s -> 4458.60s]  All right. I think I'm going crazy. Where is the spider cavern? This has to be this way. It has to
[4458.60s -> 4496.01s]  be right down here. This is it, right? This is it right here. This is it. Oh, it's not it. Act three
[4496.01s -> 4517.10s]  Pepe laugh. Yeah. He's missing chests like this. I'm fine. Okay. I'm okay. Mages dying so quickly.
[4517.82s -> 4536.23s]  Spider cavern. I'm running out of stamina. It was really entertaining for a second when you asked
[4536.23s -> 4541.91s]  us how to pronounce McDonald's. Thanks. That was a cool conversation. You're right.
[4547.29s -> 4551.13s]  Terraria stream 2.0. You're walking around letting your minions do everything.
[4560.78s -> 4565.58s]  Is this what it feels like if somebody comes in to like the store you work at and complains
[4565.58s -> 4573.16s]  about something that you don't have control over? So I came in yesterday and there was,
[4573.88s -> 4577.96s]  I was going to buy this book. Why do you not have more than two of those books in your inventory?
[4579.69s -> 4587.37s]  I don't, I don't, we, I don't fucking know. I don't know. Well, why don't you? What are you idiot?
[4588.25s -> 4591.93s]  No, I don't, I have nothing to do with what kind of inventory we get. I just work here.
[4592.89s -> 4604.38s]  We just don't, somebody bought them. Somebody picked skeleton mages. Why did you do that? I
[4604.38s -> 4628.10s]  didn't, but you did though. Get me the manager. No, they've been so, that's been, that's been a
[4628.10s -> 4632.58s]  buzz kill. The rumors are really, that was going to be a huge one. And then they went,
[4632.58s -> 4646.94s]  no, no, no, no, no. I look forward to them now somehow. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. I didn't,
[4646.94s -> 4655.37s]  I didn't pick that. Uh, chat did. Why do you associate with them? Um, because they're here.
[4656.09s -> 4662.92s]  Well, why are you letting them in? It's part of what I, what is it what I do? That's what I'm
[4662.92s -> 4671.80s]  doing. We're in the flier jungle again. All right. Have I lost my fucking mind? It's been a while
[4671.80s -> 4679.83s]  since I played. Oh my God. I forgot about those guys. Normie build. Oh my God. Okay. Seriously.
[4679.83s -> 4686.74s]  I can't die to this. I will die. Yeah. I just, I was in here yesterday and it looks like you're
[4686.74s -> 4704.66s]  doing a normie build. I'd like to make a return on, on the bits that I gave because you're doing a
[4704.66s -> 4714.07s]  normie build. And then this drops. Oops. Well, I actually just did break something. It drops like
[4714.07s -> 4720.70s]  a big container. It's like shattered glass in it. Uh, man, did you drop this down the stairs?
[4721.34s -> 4744.54s]  Why does it matter? I have my receipt and no, it was an elevator shaft. Oh, are you all right?
[4744.54s -> 4764.68s]  How have I not found this? I'm going to lose my mind. It's not, how have I not found the spider
[4764.68s -> 4790.65s]  cavern? Dude, the golem's dead. He's dead. It always takes forever. I know. But how have I,
[4790.65s -> 4800.36s]  I look at all the, I've covered so much ground. Uh, he's not dead. He's alive and he doesn't get
[4800.36s -> 4817.53s]  to be as cool. All right. I'm going to say maybe closer to town. Let's go downtown. He's a washed
[4817.53s -> 4836.58s]  up Diablo bro. Yeah. I know. Down this way. It's not the one. It's not our favorite one.
[4837.22s -> 4844.42s]  All right. What about that way down here? Cause this is the arachnid layer. It has to be close
[4844.42s -> 4854.26s]  to this. Below it maybe. Cause that's the arachnid layer, not the spider cavern. There's no other way
[4854.26s -> 4872.50s]  to go that way. So it has to be over here. Down this way. Maybe over there. You need to look up
[4872.50s -> 4876.66s]  a walk through. No, walk through this. It's randomly generated. There's no walk through will help me.
[4877.62s -> 4912.23s]  Over here. There's some, yeah. Right here. I see us. Oh, this is a great marsh. Hold on. Let me
[4912.23s -> 4934.98s]  look at the full map. Is it down here? Cause the, the, wait, it might've, it might be down here.
[4935.86s -> 4955.69s]  Did I just miss it or something down this way? Oh, don't tell me it's right here. I've walked
[4955.69s -> 4962.66s]  past it. No, that was the arachnid layer. It's not the same one. Hold on. Let me stand still.
[4965.24s -> 4968.92s]  All right. It's probably right here. I probably just didn't see it like in the corner.
[4977.99s -> 5000.58s]  No, no, it would be purple. What a pain in the ass. Yes, I know. Search for his eye in the spider
[5000.66s -> 5021.78s]  cavern. I wish you could tell me where it was. All right. I'm going to walk out the front door
[5021.78s -> 5032.38s]  again. No, give me stamina potions. Be connected to the flayer jungle. Yeah. That's what I thought
[5032.38s -> 5048.22s]  too. Act three. It's great. You don't even sell stamina potions. Do I ever like to go through
[5048.22s -> 5075.46s]  another act to get them? Jesus Christ. All right. Let's go. Hey, what the hell do you want?
[5076.42s -> 5090.78s]  What are you doing here? Daryl's dead. Fuck off already. All right. What we got? Not here.
[5090.78s -> 5112.81s]  It would be over here. Nope. It would be right here. Nope. We do the left that way. I think it
[5112.81s -> 5120.38s]  might be somewhere. Me too. That's the great. No, that's the great marsh over there. Dermot,
[5120.38s -> 5125.10s]  you were already there. No, that was the arachnid layer. That was not the spider cavern. I already
[5125.10s -> 5140.70s]  went inside the arachnid layer. It's two different dungeons. Look, look what I found. Just a sliver
[5140.70s -> 5159.42s]  on the side and it's guaranteed to be right here. Spider cavern. What do you mean rude?
[5161.05s -> 5165.37s]  Wait, how was me saying fucking what the fuck? You fucking dumb. How is that rude?
[5167.18s -> 5171.34s]  I'm just making like a point. I'm saying like stupid fucking goddamn fucking comment.
[5171.34s -> 5174.98s]  But is that rude? Just trying to be like agreeable, you know.
[5174.98s -> 5199.24s]  You're being a bully. Oh, nope. You should put on a mature content filter. Look at all this crap I
[5199.24s -> 5208.81s]  have. I have so many stamina. I thought it was going to take so much longer too. If we can get
[5208.81s -> 5221.22s]  the eye. What's the deal with airline food? It's actually kind of good now. Snacks are pretty top
[5221.22s -> 5231.61s]  tier. I've had like those like eat up boxes from JetBlue. They're pretty great actually. They're
[5231.61s -> 5236.81s]  really good. It's like you can get like six bucks or something. You can get a like this like sausage
[5236.81s -> 5241.77s]  jerky cheese like crackers and they're like they're like nice brands too. It's actually kind of good
[5241.77s -> 5262.09s]  now. No seriously. When was the last time you guys had uh I mean obviously depends on what airline
[5262.09s -> 5275.08s]  you're on but by JetBlue you got a plenty of options. Oh did I mention more non-stop flights
[5275.08s -> 5297.18s]  than any airline in the country? Something like that. How's iron doing? Good. Rich streamer eats
[5297.18s -> 5304.07s]  airline food for lunch every day. That would probably not. I wouldn't want that. I wouldn't
[5304.07s -> 5323.74s]  want to eat airplane food every day. I feel like something bad might happen. Skeleton mages keep
[5323.74s -> 5338.54s]  dying. They're almost getting to the point where they're unsummonable. My airplane food is for
[5338.54s -> 5374.01s]  airplanes. Gasoline. I'm trying to lose health too. I can't just be an idiot. No wrong. Oh a scepter.
[5374.65s -> 5378.89s]  I'm not playing as paladin though. Unfortunately not a paladin.
[5384.81s -> 5391.05s]  Balanced. There's all knives should be. Give that person. Give that person a raise.
[5402.82s -> 5407.38s]  Lightning? No just wrong. Oh don't get hit. Don't get hit. Don't get hit. I have amplify damage on
[5407.38s -> 5414.97s]  me. It means I can die in one hit. There's a jade figurine. That's a good one to have.
[5417.03s -> 5426.70s]  There's the random quest. Man that guy just won the internet.
[5430.94s -> 5443.29s]  That guy just won the internet. Dude. All right we have the figurine now. Let's get out of here.
[5449.27s -> 5455.75s]  Meshef told me he had a fondness for jade figurines. On his trading voyages he could
[5455.75s -> 5462.58s]  put a strange little figurine into such small statues. Show him the ashes of Guile that
[5462.58s -> 5470.68s]  mixed with you a potion. Only it can reveal the true path to Mephisto. Is the game quiet?
[5470.68s -> 5477.08s]  Face the eye in the Herodric Cube along with Kaleem's other relics. The heart, the brain,
[5477.08s -> 5491.18s]  and the flail. I don't know. It is. All right search for Kaleem's brain in the flayer dungeon.
[5491.74s -> 5495.90s]  Now we go to Meshef. Say hey Meshef. What do you think about this?
[5503.69s -> 5515.18s]  Well it's still holy. I wish I'd never returned to this accursed place. Praise you. That jade
[5515.18s -> 5520.86s]  figurine will complete the set I was collecting here. I've had the statuette of a golden bird
[5520.86s -> 5535.38s]  for years but I consider it a fair exchange. I low sell high. Ask Cain about the bird. Oh
[5535.38s -> 5541.05s]  that's worth way more than what you came with. You should try to sell that to somebody for a profit
[5542.01s -> 5548.22s]  even though it might not be even worth a tenth of what you're getting for it. I've read legends
[5548.22s -> 5556.54s]  about a sage named Cuile who studied the mysteries of life beyond death. If I remember correctly
[5557.26s -> 5564.12s]  his ashes were ensconced within a golden statuette. It was a very strange tale.
[5566.17s -> 5575.72s]  Give the golden bird to Alcor. This is where you get something awesome. This is where you get
[5575.72s -> 5584.41s]  a cool item. The golden bird of Cuile? Thank you my friend. Busy yourself when I experiment with
[5584.41s -> 5590.82s]  the ashes within it. Then return and see what I've made for you. Return to Alcor.
[5591.30s -> 5597.54s]  And okay. What do you got? From the ashes of Cuile I have mixed for you a potion.
[5599.22s -> 5622.01s]  Got it. That potion is permanently increased 20 to your health. What?
[5622.89s -> 5633.85s]  Come on. I think I'm that dumb. 286? All right we're on the right track now. That's actually
[5633.85s -> 5639.53s]  kind of annoying to do these two in a row. You have to find the Gidvan which kind of sucks
[5639.53s -> 5644.79s]  and then this randomly drops from a champion or higher monster. So got them both knocked out of
[5644.79s -> 5649.82s]  the park right away. Now you've got to go to the Flare Dungeon get Gleam's brain. That does not
[5649.82s -> 5654.78s]  pick the loot. No. Otherwise I actually would probably not be able to even complete a single
[5654.78s -> 5675.88s]  mission in the game. All right you can pick a couple of these. All right Gleam's Eye. Rao?
[5676.98s -> 5680.10s]  We have a nice little rune collection here. Oh I already have a Rao.
[5682.38s -> 5704.81s]  I flood the market with Rao's and then dump it. Raar. Get out of here. Why? What's the point?
[5708.01s -> 5712.49s]  You know I look over and I envy some. I like want to be that person that just says like
[5712.49s -> 5719.46s]  Raar XD and some stream. You know what I mean? That's like that's just so you can do. You can
[5719.46s -> 5727.00s]  say anything. It doesn't even matter. Like I want to be and yes I have I've made plenty of
[5727.00s -> 5731.88s]  alt accounts in my on Twitch. You've seen some of them already like binary man zero one zero zero
[5731.88s -> 5739.35s]  one one one zero right? But I just want to be the guy in the chat that just writes like
[5739.35s -> 5743.59s]  laughing my ass off. When when do you get Gleam's poo poo right? Somebody said that. I didn't react
[5743.59s -> 5758.23s]  to it but like imagine being that person. Sometimes I envy you being up being able to do that. That's
[5758.23s -> 5764.15s]  the dream. That's the dream. Someone did say that. Yes they did and I looked over and I was like
[5764.15s -> 5771.16s]  mother fucker. But I was you know that could have been me. All right we're going to clear uh
[5771.16s -> 5783.98s]  where is it? It's closer. Uh what's stopping you? Um I don't know the respect of my peers
[5785.21s -> 5815.14s]  or something. He thinks he has respect. aircraft lost all respect.
[5816.74s -> 5822.78s]  So you're saying that you lost all your respect for me in 2012? What are you still doing here?
[5823.50s -> 5838.38s]  I'm here being angry. Why are you hate watching me right now? Am I being hate watched? Is that
[5838.38s -> 5847.98s]  what's going on? I look for the uh flare dungeon. There it is. Now look at how easy that was compared
[5847.98s -> 5881.06s]  to the other one. All right get in there. I'm not killing you. Take a look. 10 to 26. Uh he has a
[5881.06s -> 5885.38s]  unique on right now right? And this thing's much better. Notice how he has not been in any trouble
[5885.38s -> 5892.89s]  at all. He's healing 10% of his health per hit. This guy's this is going to be a perfect boss
[5892.89s -> 5915.74s]  friend. Four mages now and five still. What? Careful that the fire can melt you instantly
[5916.78s -> 5929.80s]  as you've seen. Very very dangerous. Sometimes I feel like we're all just the people who slow
[5929.80s -> 5954.38s]  down to look at the car accident. Um that's an interesting thought but no it's inaccurate.
[5955.70s -> 5963.19s]  This would be like you seeing car accident pulling over getting out of the car sitting
[5963.19s -> 5967.75s]  on the curb and watching the rest of the accident and everything play out and like the police report
[5967.75s -> 5986.60s]  and stuff. And it takes like six hours or so and you fall asleep on the curb. You just sleep in
[5986.60s -> 5994.31s]  there. Eventually cop comes over and he's like hey um you good? Oh yeah yeah yeah it was just like
[5995.11s -> 5999.75s]  glad to see that. I was oh yeah I'm going to bed. I'm going I'm going to bed. Bye Jerma.
[6000.39s -> 6040.41s]  Wait what are you talking about? While mocking the accident. Wait you wait you you know it looks
[6040.41s -> 6051.05s]  just a fender bender. Why did you not see that car? Look at his look at his bumper. You you broke
[6051.05s -> 6061.94s]  that bumper. And then you over here the cop. Sir I'm gonna have to ask you to step out of the car.
[6061.94s -> 6085.51s]  Oh oh mama s. All right I could die in here. I need friends. I know I have to I can't not I
[6085.51s -> 6092.33s]  can't just start talking random shit in hardcore. I know I have a bunch of people playing the game
[6092.33s -> 6107.19s]  for me. Okay okay. Okay okay I have to stop fucking around. This is I don't if I lose it I
[6107.19s -> 6132.47s]  can't just respawn. Mom said it was my turn. Well your mom is not my mom. Well I don't have
[6132.47s -> 6149.72s]  to listen to your mom. My mom said it was okay. Watch out for traps. All right it's down here.
[6176.98s -> 6179.54s]  Guys are dead. These guys are dead.
[6189.56s -> 6197.29s]  Watch out Jerma the the soul the killers the flares are coming.
[6198.17s -> 6222.50s]  Come on give me a unique ring. I think it's all worth it. Unique ring. That was I'm gonna put that
[6222.50s -> 6230.86s]  on if that was plus three to uh skeletons. A lot of death in there. That's a scary room.
[6231.66s -> 6244.01s]  Oh if. Cool yeah I don't know why but for a long time when I was younger I thought it was
[6244.01s -> 6269.78s]  re-enjuvenation potion. Level two here we go. Oh you were a stupid kid.
[6269.78s -> 6295.67s]  Paladin only. You know I can't I want to write that. I hate paladins. What about you?
[6296.63s -> 6300.15s]  Paladins are fun to play because you feel like you're contributing.
[6301.51s -> 6308.39s]  When you used to walk into a lobby and people would say like oh paladin yeah what kind of paladin
[6308.39s -> 6315.19s]  would you like? Oh all defensive defensive paladin. I don't even have any moves. I just
[6315.19s -> 6321.35s]  had 20 points 25 plus points is some of the best defensive or you just walk next to people and just
[6321.35s -> 6346.95s]  chatted. You're just a walking buff. Wow kind of like how you're doing this now. Kind of.
[6352.20s -> 6367.99s]  So take a rating. No I'm participating. I'm making them take a hundred percent more damage.
[6368.55s -> 6387.59s]  That's participation. Are you guys the skeletons? Yeah. Watch out guys.
[6388.55s -> 6402.63s]  We got a raid. Watch out. Here comes a raid from a channel. We did it. We defended.
[6418.42s -> 6424.89s]  Yeah I think you know what I figured it out. I figured it out. That is me chatting in a random
[6424.89s -> 6430.98s]  fucking stream. What I just did right there. I do that all the time. I do shit like that all the
[6430.98s -> 6454.20s]  fucking time. Though I do get to participate in that. No they all left. They away from the fire.
[6454.84s -> 6456.12s]  Look at he killed all the skeletons.
[6463.94s -> 6471.16s]  What streamers do you watch? That's a pretty cool question.
[6472.04s -> 6476.60s]  Uh I open up my own VODs and watch them back every night. I really like that guy.
[6488.87s -> 6522.44s]  Level three. Here it is. Out here somewhere. It's an ego. Um is it? Stop stepping on shit.
[6523.08s -> 6525.48s]  You're stepping on it. Oh these guys are running over all the traps.
[6526.20s -> 6533.06s]  Fuck. That just saved my life whatever it was. I don't know what it was but it saved my life
[6533.06s -> 6541.58s]  freezing because they all stopped. Oh my god I have to leave. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.
[6541.58s -> 6545.42s]  I have to leave because these guys are going to come. No I'm kidding. Alright everyone get in.
[6545.42s -> 6552.81s]  Get in here please. Everybody get in. Jeez they all started standing outside.
[6555.00s -> 6565.72s]  If those two guys with fire came over I may have died. That was kind of terrifying. I have no way
[6565.72s -> 6587.00s]  to defend myself. I just have skeletons. I just have friends and death is permanent so I can't
[6587.00s -> 6620.62s]  walk around. It's called mess. What a mess. What a mess. What a mess. Wait doesn't it say hardcore
[6620.62s -> 6628.41s]  on the top right when you're in hardcore mode? What are you talking about? Well you watched me
[6628.41s -> 6646.65s]  select it right? Yeah you guys you guys watched me check the box. Does it? Oh got him. Okay don't
[6646.65s -> 6651.51s]  scare me like that. Not like it matters. If this character dies I could just delete him. Like if
[6651.99s -> 6665.05s]  it's not like that changes very much. I'm very paranoid in this room though because of these
[6665.05s -> 6686.14s]  things. These guys are a pain in the ass. Fire zero. Hey you should do a killed by enemy joke.
[6687.34s -> 6703.53s]  It'd be kind of funny actually. It'd be really funny. Come on where is it? Come on.
[6703.53s -> 6717.14s]  Come on. Come on. Explored almost the whole thing. Where's the chest? Over here. Bang on the left.
[6719.64s -> 6726.36s]  And don't go too far because wait for everyone to get here. This corner. There it is. All right.
[6726.36s -> 6732.26s]  There's a champion there and there's lightning and shit in here. Yeah I ain't going in.
[6733.40s -> 6746.74s]  Fuck that. You guys do it for me. Oh yep immune to fire. Just kill them. I don't want nothing
[6746.74s -> 6761.98s]  to do with that. Good. Nice work. That's another unique. All right. Hold on. Yeah. Is this shield?
[6769.48s -> 6776.44s]  Oh no. It's it's ethereal. It can't be repaired. It can. I can only use this until it breaks.
[6784.31s -> 6802.74s]  50% chance to block. 50% chance of open wounds. Tart it into a golem. Yeah probably.
[6802.74s -> 6817.72s]  I can't carry anymore. All right. Let me just put this. Damn it. That would be a pretty cool.
[6818.44s -> 6827.13s]  That'd be 50% chance to bleed. That would be cool actually. Let me make a ruby.
[6831.18s -> 6839.30s]  Time to clean up this inventory. Pissing me off. Okay. Time to clean my room. All right.
[6839.30s -> 6844.47s]  I'm cleaning my room. F. How many F's do I have? Um yeah. Time to clean the room.
[6846.57s -> 6870.14s]  If uh-oh guys. I can't make mules. I can't make more than one character to store things.
[6870.94s -> 6884.20s]  That's a problem. I love collecting items. Open bnet. I can't even use open bnet. Apparently I
[6884.20s -> 6895.99s]  did something so awful. So rotten and terrible that I'm banned from open battle net as well.
[6896.07s -> 6904.47s]  Even open bnet. Yes. Where hacking is legal. Hacking is legal on open bnet.
[6916.25s -> 6933.29s]  I ring scammed too many people. No. I don't understand. Let me clean my room. Let's sell
[6933.29s -> 6954.73s]  this ship. Cloud skull banned from open bnet as well. There are people that like speed hack
[6954.73s -> 6960.07s]  and teleport around in open bnet. There are people that have modded characters running around with
[6960.07s -> 6967.48s]  five million of every stat in open bnet. What the hell did I do to not be allowed in that?
[6967.48s -> 6991.00s]  Wait. Let me sell. I think it's time to. Yeah. Let's clean my room. Time to clean the room.
[6993.38s -> 7027.67s]  What are we doing on diamonds? We're good. All right. Keep writing. All right. Guys.
[7028.31s -> 7041.77s]  Let's take a look at the skills. We got a skill point to use. Please. Use it. You need some
[7041.77s -> 7047.94s]  reminders. Of course this is the summoning tree again. This is blood golem. This is iron golem.
[7048.82s -> 7052.28s]  This is fire golem. But I don't think we can't do that yet. I don't think.
[7053.00s -> 7062.23s]  This is just to make sure you can see. All right. You can see. Where's the skill point going?
[7064.38s -> 7090.10s]  Vote. No. Dim vision gang. Curses are important but we're neglecting them.
[7090.82s -> 7105.59s]  When I say we but I mean you. When I say you. I mean you. 212 of you that clicked on teeth.
[7106.47s -> 7119.35s]  I don't even know what you're clicking on over here. Make sure you try to differentiate so
[7119.35s -> 7138.26s]  the blob doesn't go together. Which one do you want me to do? I can't even do the guys.
[7138.26s -> 7148.76s]  Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Look. I can't do the fire one. That's level 30. I am currently level 26.
[7149.56s -> 7162.23s]  I can't do that yet. Fire golems not available. Fire golem receives but you got to figure out.
[7162.23s -> 7170.28s]  You guys. I think you guys are lost. What do you want? Figure it out. Skeletons. Powerful golems.
[7170.28s -> 7174.68s]  Do you want me to you know what I mean? This hit by the way revive is a thing in the game as well.
[7174.68s -> 7183.72s]  It revives any monster in the whole game. They fight for you instead. Fire golem. Iron golem.
[7183.72s -> 7197.93s]  They all get benefits from each other. Golem mastery. Okay. We've seen it. Also this is what's
[7197.93s -> 7205.91s]  available in poison and bone. This is what's available in curses. Iron maiden. Weaken. There's
[7205.91s -> 7210.47s]  also decrepify. Curses a group of enemies to make them slow, weak, and take amplified damage.
[7212.87s -> 7220.04s]  Lower resist. These seem kind of cool. These are cool too. All right. What do you want?
[7220.04s -> 7222.60s]  Pick it again. This time know that I can't go doing things in the bottom.
[7223.48s -> 7241.06s]  And make sure you're clicking in the correct spot to differentiate your vote from manipulating us.
[7251.93s -> 7263.21s]  Well. Still clicking on the fire golem. And revive. 20% of the people that have clicked so far
[7264.17s -> 7281.85s]  still don't get it. We are going to click on iron golem. Okay. Bone wall.
[7282.65s -> 7290.39s]  Another point in iron. Let's see what it does. Here we go. Just, you know, so you can see to make
[7290.39s -> 7299.66s]  sure that I'm doing, I'm actually clicking these. Remembering them. So this is going to bring,
[7300.30s -> 7310.81s]  it's going to bring the thorns up to 165%. Almost double the defense. What's the attack turn into?
[7310.81s -> 7324.71s]  Seven to nine. Let's see. Yeah. Huge defense increase and more thorns. All right. Stat points.
[7324.71s -> 7331.02s]  You know what to do. You guys are smart. You know what to do. By the way, if you don't know,
[7331.02s -> 7336.94s]  strength is melee damage and wearing heavy equipment. Dexterity is how often you hit
[7336.94s -> 7343.83s]  enemies in your defense. How often you obviously don't get hit. Vitality, health and stamina.
[7343.83s -> 7381.77s]  Energy is just mana pool. More mana. Getting close to a tier list. What is the right choice?
[7382.65s -> 7391.27s]  Um, if you're talking about a super duper min max build. No, why would I even tell you?
[7401.62s -> 7416.71s]  Vitality. Vitality. At least you guys are doing that. If you guys actually did put every point
[7416.71s -> 7423.64s]  to strength. Remember when I took that fire damage down to here without this extra 150,
[7423.64s -> 7431.45s]  whatever, a hundred plus health. I'm dead. Cleaned my room a little bit.
[7434.22s -> 7441.98s]  Stored some gold just in case I die. And then, you know, my heirs don't get it. All right. We
[7441.98s -> 7452.30s]  need to get the heart. Not the heart. The brain, right? Kaleem's brain. How many sloths are in
[7452.30s -> 7462.90s]  here? Three. Five to fifteen. Hold on. This is most fortunate. Kaleem's brain knows Mephisto's
[7462.90s -> 7469.86s]  weakness. Place it in the Herodric Cube along with Kaleem's other relics. The eye, the heart,
[7469.86s -> 7485.70s]  and the flail. The eye, the heart, the brain, and the flail. I don't wonder
[7485.86s -> 7509.32s]  what Wizard of Oz character wanted that. This guy's still alive. Wow. Yes, I'm doing fine.
[7509.96s -> 7524.09s]  All right. If I do, we do fire and ice. Fire, ice, and poison. All in one. All right. Yeah,
[7524.09s -> 7529.85s]  I'm going to do, let's go, let's go to the fountain drink thing and just get like Coke, Diet Coke,
[7529.85s -> 7545.96s]  Sprite, Pepsi, the high C. Let's just do it all. This is eight to twelve fire damage. The five
[7545.96s -> 7554.18s]  percent life per hit is not going to do it for me. Let's go. Look, later on in the game,
[7554.18s -> 7571.26s]  these are going to drop all the time anyways. Oh, shit. Five to thirty fire damage. That's
[7571.26s -> 7576.98s]  pretty good. Oh, shit. I got two of these. I got two of these. No, we're just going Diet Coke.
[7576.98s -> 7588.12s]  We're just going to go Diet Coke. All right. Eighteen to seventy-two fire damage. And I got,
[7588.12s -> 7598.94s]  all right, let's see. Oh, fuck. Yeah, let's go. Thirty-five to a hundred and three damage.
[7598.94s -> 7610.34s]  It's just raw, raw. What class are we again? We are summoning Necromancer, but Chad is doing this
[7610.34s -> 7618.15s]  laugh out loud scenario where they put most of my points into strength. So if I'm going to have
[7618.15s -> 7622.97s]  more than sixty to a hundred strength, then I might as well swing a weapon at somebody
[7622.97s -> 7629.13s]  because they have not given me any offensive move. I have a shield and a bunch of skeleton friends.
[7629.13s -> 7649.46s]  That's it. This is just what's happening. Look at this thing. See, like the red, the red. All
[7649.46s -> 7660.94s]  right. Colleen's heart is in the sewers under the Curest Bazaar. This guy's complaining even
[7660.94s -> 7668.63s]  though he's got one tooth. Yeah. No, right. I do have an offensive ability. Let's see how much
[7668.63s -> 7688.76s]  damage it does. Teeth. Yeah. Okay. Right. Okay. So that's that's comparable. All right. Wait,
[7688.76s -> 7697.69s]  wait, wait, wait. I got to go back. We got to go back up to the Flare Jungle. Not me. I want you
[7697.69s -> 7705.51s]  to succeed. That's why I'm clicking on Constitution every time. Thanks. Dentist build. You can do a
[7705.51s -> 7712.04s]  dentist build. You just put all your points in the teeth and then all your points into bone
[7712.04s -> 7721.40s]  sphere and shit. You can have like 50 teeth come up. Dude, I'm going to destroy everybody with this
[7721.40s -> 7736.87s]  build. I'm doing a lot of damage. It's not even without this is without amplify on. Am I really
[7736.87s -> 7746.26s]  out of stamina? Tier list stream. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. All right. Next level
[7746.26s -> 7766.65s]  up. I'm going to do the next tier list. We're going to keep going up to the Curest Bazaar.
[7767.29s -> 7804.12s]  I believe it's this way. This way. Poison. Uh-huh. That was the Gitvin. Hang on. Right.
[7805.08s -> 7821.46s]  Let's get to the Bazaar. I thought they were on the other team for a second.
[7822.18s -> 7833.64s]  Uh, no. Keep going up. We can't. Where are the trees? The weird tree enemies are scary.
[7835.08s -> 7851.78s]  Oh, I missed three times. Bone Master needs bone abilities.
[7851.78s -> 7877.78s]  This is the heart maybe. See the fire when I hit people. It's so cool. It's that little
[7877.78s -> 7900.33s]  explosion. It goes, why are you killing? This is a, this is a war for good. This is a war for good
[7900.33s -> 7924.98s]  and evil, man. Hell's demons versus the rest of us. Easy. This is demons versus me and you.
[7924.98s -> 7947.16s]  Everyone's still alive. This is pretty great. You're with the demons. How could you?
[7949.70s -> 7961.18s]  Traitor. Oh, Iron Golem's dead. I mean, there was too much overwhelming. Overwhelming.
[7963.02s -> 7983.27s]  You got to close the game. What? It's hardcore for my minions too. Oh, fuck. That was bad.
[7985.03s -> 8008.71s]  That could have been. How long until Fire Golem friend, people heaven.
[8010.30s -> 8017.11s]  Uh, we need four more levels. I'm assuming before we finished act three, you'll see, uh,
[8017.11s -> 8021.51s]  Fire Golem maybe ends. And if your fellow chat members also would like to see that
[8023.74s -> 8042.14s]  fight indecisive recently, we spread out. I don't like being spread out. Uh, Vic leveled up.
[8043.58s -> 8058.01s]  I was, you know, I forgot if I'm going to hold things in my inventory, I might as well just
[8058.01s -> 8080.33s]  see what they are on the way to Bazzar. I don't use Kane to identify things because on the fly,
[8080.65s -> 8083.83s]  I might want it. Plus there's not that much money.
[8087.05s -> 8089.93s]  This might be better than what I have on right now. I don't want to go home for this.
[8091.21s -> 8096.44s]  I mean, it's not, but it could have been, but yeah, it is. No, it's not. That's actually good
[8096.44s -> 8106.20s]  too. 5% chance to cast Frost Nova. That's where that's coming from. You're impatient.
[8106.92s -> 8113.18s]  That's what the point of the book is for. So I can trash it that I don't want. I'm going to
[8113.18s -> 8134.02s]  keep going back to town. That's too, it's too far. The F rune ring. All right. Do I have enough
[8134.02s -> 8140.02s]  for just even a shitty rune word? I know there's dozens and dozens and dozens of them in the game,
[8140.02s -> 8152.47s]  but do I have any of the crappy ones? Uh, two or three slot armor? How F? What about three?
[8153.59s -> 8165.99s]  How F, huh? It's called stealth. I might want to look that up.
[8165.99s -> 8176.60s]  Here. Stealth would be pretty good.
[8182.76s -> 8191.10s]  That's not even a real thing. What are you trying to get me to say? Okay. I'm trying to figure out
[8191.10s -> 8206.81s]  what you're, what are you trying to get me to say? Here's my heart. Heart. Okay, but wouldn't it be
[8206.81s -> 8223.58s]  just, uh, that's come on. I hope I don't miss anything. I still only have level one bone armor.
[8231.64s -> 8235.48s]  Yo, that's right. Mr. Peanut fucking died. We talked about it in the pre-stream chat.
[8239.22s -> 8243.94s]  We went over this for like 40 minutes, but imagine nobody caring about peanuts.
[8244.66s -> 8255.45s]  Go point where you have to kill one of the most iconic food brand mascots and not just like,
[8255.45s -> 8259.85s]  oh, we're discontinuing the use of Mr. Peanut. No, we're going, we're, we were going to kill him.
[8270.04s -> 8283.69s]  Super bold marketing shit. We have to go back around. Wait, really? Yes, really. Yes. We've
[8283.69s -> 8301.06s]  gone full, full kill somebody for memes. And I brought this up too. It's a really important
[8301.06s -> 8308.54s]  point. I'm surprised none of the other serial characters have died. Like doesn't Sonny the
[8308.54s -> 8312.46s]  Cocoa Puff Bird do crazy shit and like jump out of planes without parachutes and like
[8313.02s -> 8335.90s]  crash his car into stuff? How is he still alive? Like the Trix Rabbit stalks children
[8336.71s -> 8343.51s]  and steals from them. Should we be in prison by now? Okay. That was fucking close.
[8355.06s -> 8369.46s]  That fire move is so deadly. That's the run killer. I need fire resistance. I don't even
[8369.46s -> 8388.28s]  care if I put it on just even if I take something good off. That's it. All right, here we go. Player
[8388.28s -> 8393.82s]  jungle, finally. And from here, we're going to go to the lower cuirass and then cuirass bazaar.
[8396.23s -> 8412.18s]  Mr. Peanut Wiki. Yes, some of the other masked food mascots live so much more dangerous lives
[8412.18s -> 8422.47s]  than Mr. Peanut. How often did Captain Crunch get raided by other pirates? They had like swords
[8422.47s -> 8442.54s]  and guns and stuff. Tony the Tiger played soccer. He could have taken a football, a soccer ball
[8442.54s -> 8451.83s]  right in the mouth and like broke his face and shit. Mr. Peanut just dances. He just dances.
[8451.83s -> 8456.47s]  He just dances around. He's like, oh, Mr. Peanut, my PB crisps. It's not like he's
[8456.47s -> 8471.78s]  doing anything dangerous. Speaking of PB crisps, can they sacrifice Mr. Peanut to bring back PB
[8471.78s -> 8478.44s]  crisps? Is that what this whole thing is for? This is going to... All right, here's my prediction.
[8478.44s -> 8484.36s]  Super Bowl ad PB crisps is coming back and this was just a big thing for him to reveal that PB
[8484.36s -> 8490.12s]  crisps are returning is not really dead. This is a big marketing ploy to bring back PB crisps,
[8490.12s -> 8500.23s]  the only product that anyone buys from planters that ever did buy. And I have a theory that the
[8500.23s -> 8503.99s]  reason why they discontinued him and they're like, oh, maybe one day we'll bring him back.
[8503.99s -> 8510.81s]  No, they were delicious. What were they made out of? What's the big secret as to why everyone
[8510.81s -> 8517.96s]  wants them? Everyone loves those things. Why'd they get rid of them? Yeah, everyone loves PB
[8517.96s -> 8527.90s]  crisps. Yummy peanut cream in the middle. What chemical was in there? I'm saying like, what?
[8527.90s -> 8531.82s]  Why won't they bring them back? Ah, shit, we can't bring back the original recipe.
[8532.70s -> 8550.68s]  They were good though. These things are so awesome. I used to, in my mouth, I would separate the outer
[8550.68s -> 8556.04s]  shell of the crisp and separate the inside peanut butter, eat the shell first, and then I would eat
[8556.04s -> 8559.56s]  the peanut butter in the middle afterwards. You all did it and it was the best thing you've ever done.
[8560.52s -> 8570.49s]  Or I would peel the shell around it, eat it, and then take that solid creamy peanut butter
[8570.49s -> 8588.60s]  and put it in, eat it. I actually have to go. So you're fucked up. No, that these are coming
[8588.60s -> 8592.92s]  from the people that told me that they eat Reese's. They like stick their tongue through the middle,
[8593.64s -> 8598.60s]  push up, smear out the peanut butter, and then put it into their hand and eat it and then break
[8598.60s -> 8602.60s]  the ring in half. I told you guys that I eat Reese's just normally, and it was like, what?
[8603.32s -> 8612.98s]  But you're a serial killer. Like I, in Oreos, I talked about Oreos. I eat Oreos just normally.
[8612.98s -> 8618.18s]  I dunk them in milk and I just eat them. But you don't twist them and like rub your feet on them
[8618.18s -> 8638.78s]  and then sit on them and then blow your nose on it and then eat it? No, I don't. I thought you said
[8638.78s -> 8649.51s]  you dunked Reese's in milk. No, I dunked cookies in milk. I have another, uh, just sell it, whatever.
[8649.51s -> 8660.38s]  I'm gonna gamble. I know it's pronounced Reese's, but Reese's is how I say it. Reese's
[8661.02s -> 8666.14s]  with different countries, different dialects, you know, like Reese's. That's how we say it here.
[8667.66s -> 8683.35s]  A flawed skull in here. I have these greater health potions. All right, I'm just gonna sell it. I
[8683.35s -> 8692.70s]  don't want it. I haven't repaired in a long time. I want sweets so bad right now. I don't blame you.
[8692.70s -> 8718.25s]  They're really delicious. I don't blame you. Bagged milk, yes or no? Um, I don't, I don't know.
[8718.25s -> 8735.88s]  All right, here we go. You know what I'm about to do with this. Buy and be reborn. I can't,
[8735.88s -> 8751.82s]  it's not made out of milk. I'll figure out what to do with it. How do I speed up a stream? Um,
[8752.78s -> 8757.90s]  you leave the stream, you go to sleep, go take like a two-hour nap and come back to your chair.
[8758.70s -> 8774.34s]  That should do it. You need to go faster. You can't, there is no such thing as going
[8774.42s -> 8783.27s]  faster in an ARPG. You got to take it slow and steady. We're not trying to win any race,
[8784.54s -> 8794.98s]  just trying to continue. Wait, that was the right way, wasn't it? I'll get a pizza instead.
[8795.54s -> 8807.94s]  Isn't it up this way? God damn it, I need potions. Go back, go back, go back, go back, go back. I'm
[8807.94s -> 8824.30s]  going to buy stamina potions. Oh, cat, I'm not going to answer that question.
[8825.42s -> 8841.96s]  I'm going to just, I'm going to damn you. Did I, I thought I was there? Apparently not.
[8842.84s -> 8860.79s]  I need to know if I beat your record. Um, no, we, I, I used to bring the computer into the bathroom.
[8865.56s -> 8871.16s]  I used to bring either a laptop, I would bring my whole computer into the bathroom. A lot of
[8871.16s -> 8877.32s]  long-term viewers know this. When I was younger, I, I wanted to play so bad and just chill and
[8877.32s -> 8882.60s]  relax. So I would bring my entire computer into the bathroom, plug it in and shit and sit on the
[8882.60s -> 8889.00s]  toilet and have a little desk, a little card table. And I would sit there for like two hours.
[8889.96s -> 8911.80s]  There we go. And it would be so irritating because after I was done, I had to take it all apart and
[8911.88s -> 8924.52s]  put it all back where it was supposed to be. And it was the biggest pain in the ass. Can you imagine
[8924.52s -> 8931.42s]  being my parents? As I didn't have headphones, I had like little speakers. Can you imagine being
[8931.42s -> 8942.63s]  my parents and knowing that your son was in the bathroom and you hear a battle scenario? This is
[8942.63s -> 8954.71s]  what you listen to. What you're hearing right now. Can you come back every 20 minutes and still hear
[8954.71s -> 8970.23s]  this? Like, what is he doing? I need the, uh, curious, the sewers under the curious as are.
[8971.03s -> 8988.54s]  There's also a skill book here or a stat book. He must have eaten something funny.
[8992.18s -> 9004.65s]  Well, I don't know. My, you cooked it. Now imagine if I had the opportunity to be playing online
[9005.61s -> 9015.22s]  with a mic in there. You just hear that toilet flush sound. You couldn't mute microphones back
[9015.22s -> 9027.18s]  then. And people still don't even mute their mics anymore. I, you think that's some kind of issue.
[9027.18s -> 9040.50s]  How many times have you heard somebody's ceiling fan? Somebody comes into a lobby with their
[9040.50s -> 9042.34s]  gain up to a hundred percent. And it's just like,
[9058.94s -> 9065.82s]  it's a huge, just ear piercing, blow out the microphone a hundred percent and gain
[9065.82s -> 9071.51s]  cough into the microphone. And it's like, Oh, and you rip the headset off. It's like,
[9071.51s -> 9117.53s]  it sounds like they're just walking over shattered glass in your ears. I think it's
[9117.53s -> 9143.00s]  up here. Taco bell has potato chips. Taco bell has nachos. Ooh. I mean, they have corn chips,
[9143.00s -> 9157.53s]  right? I'm gonna be mad at me for not opening chests. I'm doing it for that guy.
[9159.18s -> 9166.71s]  All right. Here we go. The bazaar. I need to find the last piece of the puzzle here.
[9168.28s -> 9170.44s]  All right. Yeah. And then after this level up, we're going to do a tier list.
[9179.83s -> 9187.45s]  We're looking for the sewers, sewers. Aren't there like six of these? Why am I saying it
[9187.45s -> 9197.45s]  like this with all the S's? Sewers. It's in the sewers. It's inside the sewers. Fuck. Now
[9197.45s -> 9213.72s]  that sounds weird. This used to be a tier, this used to be a tier list stream. The S's are,
[9214.52s -> 9226.94s]  I don't like the letter S anymore. All right. What's it like being the number one Diablo
[9226.94s -> 9233.74s]  2 streamer on Twitch? Well, real easy when you play games that nobody plays.
[9243.06s -> 9262.73s]  It's real easy to be number one when the closest number next to you is zero. Wacky,
[9262.73s -> 9283.19s]  wacky comedy stream. Is this sewers? You should stream more Hearthstone. No, this is not the sewer.
[9286.12s -> 9298.14s]  No, no, no, no. Not the sewer. Look at all this crap. Yeah. And what have a patch they last did,
[9298.14s -> 9304.46s]  like two years, three years ago to this game, whatever it was, they had, they upped the potion
[9304.46s -> 9309.99s]  drops. It was holy shit. I've never seen this before. Even with the max players and shit.
[9310.87s -> 9319.62s]  I used to do lobbies with eight people. There are other Diablo 2 streamers. I thought you said I
[9319.62s -> 9336.34s]  was the only one. Never. No, I've never played hardcore before. Doors. I said you were number
[9336.34s -> 9350.17s]  one. Oh, I thought you said that I was the only one. Like I'm the only one. Hey sewers, you got it.
[9355.94s -> 9362.76s]  Look at the ego on this guy. Level two. Playing barbarian here was really fun because they had
[9362.76s -> 9366.50s]  leap. You could just jump over around and everything. It's cool. One of the first
[9366.50s -> 9371.85s]  experiences I ever had with this game was a childhood friend of mine was in the sewers part
[9371.85s -> 9374.89s]  here and they would just do leap as barbarian. I thought it was the coolest thing I've ever seen.
[9376.09s -> 9386.60s]  Hey, new viewer here. Are you the shpee guy?
[9389.24s -> 9401.54s]  Weird to be a new viewer when Jerma is in your name. Hey dude, new viewer. I've like been on
[9401.54s -> 9425.59s]  Twitch just like browsing around and your name is in my name. Coincidence. It's weird. Also Jerma.
[9425.59s -> 9446.02s]  Maybe. It'd be weird. So are you the shpee guy or no? No. I gave that up a long time ago.
[9458.94s -> 9484.39s]  Mace. Stay healthy. Stay healthy. Stay healthy. Is this a hardcore thing? Is that what it is?
[9489.16s -> 9511.80s]  Yes. Level two. Is this some kind of hardcore thing? I mean.
[9534.06s -> 9554.31s]  There's a head jump. I'm killed. I think I got Vic here. Resident sleeper. Where's the commentary?
[9555.27s -> 9565.88s]  People are fucking trying to sleep. Oh green green green green. I think it's the same one I have.
[9566.52s -> 9572.55s]  Berserkers. Oh do I have any Berserkers?
[9575.51s -> 9589.67s]  Not a skeleton. Why are people trying to sleep? What am I saying? People are trying to fucking sleep.
[9590.79s -> 9600.25s]  Um this is kind of better. That's fire resist though. I know who would wear this. No Berserkers
[9600.25s -> 9609.98s]  again. He's got 75 fire resistance. That guy's ready to go. Nancy Drew napping room.
[9618.78s -> 9635.62s]  Key filter waiting room. Not that way. I just want to get off work. I'm playing uh
[9636.42s -> 9647.67s]  Necro dude. It's really fucking odd. What are you gonna do? A bathtub stream.
[9649.91s -> 9653.34s]  Let's turn my camera on right now until it's time to go to the bathroom.
[9653.34s -> 9668.58s]  We get some hogs in the chat to wake up these these I was gonna say I was gonna say idiots
[9668.58s -> 9684.81s]  but if you're you know if you're tired you're not an idiot you're just tired almost time for
[9684.81s -> 9689.93s]  a level up which means almost time for a tier list a tier list you said it all right I'm getting up

[9723.02s -> 9730.46s]  after this before I go to Mephisto I think I have to do a couple of endarial runs I mean
[9730.46s -> 9740.89s]  I'm kind of getting beat up if I get hit once it's like ow remember you promised me she's
[9740.89s -> 9767.82s]  impossible this bed lied about I remember that video a wink you got a wink oh yeah I'm green

[9826.22s -> 9847.66s]  squishy teeth disgusting
[9862.79s -> 9869.42s]  sewers are so huge don't run that far without I don't have anything to do
[9870.38s -> 9877.26s]  I keep forgetting that I have I'm 100% useless I am nothing without a group of people with me
[9878.22s -> 9881.66s]  I can't run forward without everybody I don't even have any moves
[9882.78s -> 9892.82s]  I don't have any spells or abilities why would I run forward I run forward to run back
[9904.73s -> 9918.81s]  what's the next tier list I wonder take a look I think we got a Jim Carrey movie

[10375.16s -> 10390.68s]  Leem's heart it's a gem shrine a gem shrine just automatically upgrades any gem in your inventory
[10390.68s -> 10395.00s]  to the next tier so I could have brought a regular gem here and it would have been
[10395.00s -> 10404.36s]  upgraded to a flawless gem and that's when I cry what we got first for Kaleem's flail and
[10404.36s -> 10416.86s]  in provincial beware of the high council Leem's heart and it still bears the courage to face
[10416.86s -> 10424.30s]  Mephisto place it in the horodric cube along with Kaleem's other relics the eye the brain

[10525.56s -> 10536.60s]  poison and bone teeth bone armor what synergies help fire golem all the golem ones so
[10537.16s -> 10542.84s]  summon resist golem mastery clay blood and iron all give a bonus to fire just as fire gives a
[10542.84s -> 10553.24s]  bonus to all the other ones as well every point that is put into blood golem gives it plus five
[10553.24s -> 10562.62s]  percent health per level to every other golem same thing with clay every point that's in clay
[10563.88s -> 10573.14s]  gives plus 20 attack rating to every other golem purses I feel like you guys want to look at these
[10573.14s -> 10580.71s]  for a second because just just bear with me life tap think about this just for a moment you will
[10580.71s -> 10588.20s]  just I'm not influencing you um anybody that's cursed by this becomes a 50 life leech to anybody

[10601.05s -> 10608.20s]  attract it's just a taunt on somebody that didn't taunt the crapify causes a group of enemies to
[10608.20s -> 10625.86s]  make them slow weak take more damage iron maiden is 200 thorns at level one and we're getting

[11161.69s -> 11164.89s]  derma rumble come on that's like some of the that's like one of some of the most fun I've ever had
[11168.33s -> 11175.72s]  that was when they announced that they were working on uh elder scroll six

[11244.25s -> 11259.06s]  doctored why this is not even my faces these are doctored images this is just me playing a game
[11259.70s -> 11282.12s]  on facecam that's the worst one this is the worst one I hate this fucking image when I go out to
[11282.12s -> 11286.52s]  places and people ask what do you do or they people people find out that I stream right
[11287.24s -> 11293.82s]  hey oh you you stream oh nice now what's your channel name I fucking hate telling them because
[11293.82s -> 11297.98s]  that's the image that pops up if you type in derma into google that's just what pops up
[11298.86s -> 11307.58s]  so it's just so ugly and gross and just I look like unkempt and unwell it's just such a bad picture
[11308.87s -> 11318.47s]  that it's so bad and it has to be everywhere it has to be the number one image search
[11318.47s -> 11323.54s]  it has to be the number one thing that's like on every wiki like why can't it be I'd rather
[11323.54s -> 11328.81s]  be this one I mean at least this one's like a joke this is me scary looking into a camera
[11329.45s -> 11334.25s]  like I'm like I'm I'm coming and I'm fucking mad I this one's a joke you know what I mean
[11338.49s -> 11349.86s]  this is deranged this is humor and I disqualify this one's not even a face
[11350.58s -> 11359.48s]  this is just me oh this is bright because I wasn't this is me naked this is gonna take some
[11359.48s -> 11377.99s]  refinement this is up pretty high for me that's up pretty high for me so is this one this one sucks
[11377.99s -> 11395.72s]  this one's just a worse version of this one he can be the best of the worst it's not even my face
[11396.36s -> 11408.02s]  there's a lot of d faces here mustache hair has to be up kind of high
[11410.92s -> 11416.90s]  uh like a twitter picture I took one time this one's all right I'll just do some refinement
[11416.90s -> 11423.05s]  this one sucks this one's just like a stretched out image of my face all right what's the best
[11423.05s -> 11462.81s]  face it's it's it's my favorite image could be could be accurate it's accurate okay it's real
[11462.81s -> 11471.13s]  um just that there's a story behind this one there's a story behind all of these this one I
[11471.13s -> 11478.50s]  think has there's so much going on in this one because the circumstance all right let's get down
[11478.50s -> 11491.80s]  here um it's I like it but it's old you know these are these are new what even what's this
[11491.80s -> 11499.53s]  even from what is this this looks like it's not taken from here this is taken from some
[11499.53s -> 11514.90s]  other place from where is it the green screen the awards ah okay the awards all right it's
[11514.90s -> 11532.84s]  pretty good this one's so stupid is the clown better than all these though you don't even
[11532.84s -> 11538.66s]  look at itchy ear like inside your ear and I can't reach that far I want to take like
[11538.66s -> 11548.70s]  a little device and go in and just like scratch but that's so bad for you it's like no you don't
[11548.70s -> 11552.60s]  you're not supposed you're not supposed to put q-tips in your ears you're really not well
[11552.60s -> 11557.00s]  everybody does it's funny we all say that to each other now I don't put q-tips in your ears
[11557.00s -> 11564.22s]  yes everyone every single person does it everyone says don't do it but all of us do it why why why
[11564.22s -> 11573.40s]  can't we just come clean about that no don't fucking do that not good for you did it this
[11573.40s -> 11619.98s]  morning I'm working on it I'm working what's the worst the worst possible face is probably this one
[11619.98s -> 11635.53s]  it's just not it's just me these two no it's this one yeah what's the best all right this
[11635.53s -> 11644.14s]  one's really bad too so is this one so is this one so is this one it's probably these are probably
[11644.14s -> 11661.29s]  the best so is this one now these belong together because they're just like screen there's just
[11661.29s -> 11668.55s]  screen caps from a youtube video I wasn't making any faces here I wasn't trying to be funny or do
[11668.55s -> 11677.96s]  a joke this is just you took a screen cap from two different videos from like 2012 oh yeah that's
[11677.96s -> 11712.73s]  bad put these two together I could you could say the same thing it's funny when you can tell when
[11712.89s -> 11730.79s]  from the same stream was it this bad one day was it this fucked up one day what was going on on
[11730.79s -> 11746.84s]  this stream these could all be the same day all right that's accurate this is yeah this is accurate
[11746.84s -> 11758.49s]  because you have four shirts that way this green one all the time is it is the green one in any
[11758.49s -> 11772.34s]  of these thank god there you go there's there's me raiding my own face not a narcissist by the
[11772.34s -> 11788.57s]  way not an egomaniac by the way the joker face is too low are you sure the joker face is better
[11788.57s -> 11803.48s]  than mustache hair or scrunched mcchicken face yeah actually yeah actually it is actually it is
[11803.48s -> 11810.50s]  it is this one's not even that good all right you're right this is should be lower too no this is
[11811.22s -> 11830.65s]  this one should be way lower again this is the same stream you can tell look at the hair there's
[11830.65s -> 11844.23s]  no coal miner here that's unfortunate you're right it's been so long since I've seen this original
[11844.23s -> 11859.62s]  image what was going on why was the light blue you were doing the storytelling stream oh right
[11859.62s -> 11870.31s]  right right okay there you go there's your there's a second tier list it only took three hours to do
[11870.31s -> 11877.90s]  the second one we do one more we'll do one more we'll do one more uh whatever this next one is
[11877.90s -> 11892.22s]  there's your list what's this one uh okay this is water this is drinking water these different
[11892.22s -> 11907.70s]  waters this is water to drink what is this what is that supposed to be this looks like car this
[11907.70s -> 11916.52s]  is like car antifreeze fluid ice water but but that who cares what's the water inside of it
[11916.52s -> 11934.73s]  where'd it come from and that would oh this this is the sparkling water right water from the sink
[11934.73s -> 11942.15s]  gross water from the toilet water from the bathtub is this this is but if i don't drink it i love i'm
[11942.71s -> 11951.13s]  i take i'm a bath hobbyist we talked about my hobbies i'm taking baths as a hobby can i put
[11951.13s -> 11962.81s]  that up here i take i take a bath like three times a week i'm not making that up i swear to god
[11964.28s -> 11990.15s]  i love it and then i go like under the water and i just go not bad true gamer all right what this
[11990.15s -> 11997.86s]  is from a river no you're gonna get like a tapeworm it's probably safer to drink toilet water than it
[11997.86s -> 12011.00s]  is to drink water right out of a river you're gonna get like this is i don't know i know that's
[12011.00s -> 12017.02s]  actually true if you you could there's like all kinds of bacteria and contaminated this is
[12017.02s -> 12024.23s]  regulated i mean as long as nobody's shipping it yeah i would probably i don't know that's tricky
[12024.23s -> 12032.81s]  where's smart water i don't know it's not on here what happened to diablo we're going back to it
[12032.81s -> 12039.69s]  we got caught up what is domino diamond water not even close to being fiji i don't even know
[12039.69s -> 12045.67s]  what it is all right let's put the antifreeze over here all right what's safer drinking antifreeze
[12045.67s -> 12064.07s]  or drinking water out of a river river water is safer than of course it is i don't even know
[12064.07s -> 12068.47s]  what these are i don't i'm just gonna put them over on d d is like i don't d is don't care
[12068.47s -> 12076.89s]  d is don't care because i've never had it drinking water from a pool but all right hold on drinking
[12076.89s -> 12089.58s]  water tier list you don't drink water from a pool there's two things going on here all right
[12089.58s -> 12103.74s]  drinking water from a pool versus drinking water from a toilet the it the toilet's probably safer
[12103.74s -> 12112.63s]  uh is this a pool that is this a pool that just got shocked or chlorinated all right yeah so it's
[12112.63s -> 12116.73s]  it's safer to drink out of a toilet than out of a pool and we're not talking about oh you got a
[12116.73s -> 12119.61s]  little bit up your nose or you got a little bit in your mouth you know we're talking about like a
[12119.61s -> 12125.70s]  we got like a full 16 ounce glass of water right drinking like a full like 24 ounce glass like
[12125.70s -> 12131.43s]  downing it on the pool right so that's i would i don't know if i would do that but i would you
[12131.43s -> 12135.03s]  know what i'd probably do that before drinking water over a toilet this is just too much to bear
[12135.03s -> 12142.07s]  i would do a full like 16 ounce glass of water from a pool then i would have 16 ounces from a
[12142.07s -> 12146.71s]  toilet but i would do toilet before i did like a random river that could have like e coli in it
[12146.71s -> 12152.74s]  and i would do river after before doing drinking any freeze so okay out of the ocean you don't
[12152.74s -> 12157.46s]  want to do that either out of a lake you don't want to do that either and then i don't know
[12157.46s -> 12169.93s]  what this is drink water from this is much safer than than this drinking water out of a lake is
[12169.93s -> 12178.63s]  probably wouldn't because the salt water salt water versus freshwater they're both bad river
[12178.63s -> 12190.36s]  yeah what no no no standing water that's even worse i would drink a full glass out of a sea
[12190.36s -> 12196.44s]  then a full glass out of a pool then a full glass out of a toilet then a full glass out of a river
[12197.18s -> 12201.61s]  running water it's moving standing water is mosquitoes and i don't want to drink mosquito
[12201.61s -> 12213.61s]  eggs and then any freeze you would die if i drank 16 ounces of salt water i'm gonna die
[12213.61s -> 12220.39s]  uh sorry guys i i used to drink gatorade out of the just for no reason the same thing i would die
[12220.39s -> 12227.02s]  if i drank 16 ounces what is this the only water i get to have ever why is this the only water i
[12227.02s -> 12241.21s]  get to drink why is if i drink 16 ounces of water you're not gonna hydrate but it's going to kill
[12241.21s -> 12261.05s]  you if you if i drink 16 ounce glass of water from the ocean i die i'm going to die but what
[12261.05s -> 12270.12s]  if i drank 16 ounces of ocean water and then a fucking full like disani right what happens
[12270.12s -> 12285.40s]  they will negate each other but this is like what are the circumstances we didn't go over the
[12285.40s -> 12292.28s]  circumstances we didn't go over the rules am i like trapped on an island am i the only person
[12292.28s -> 12298.55s]  at the pool am i the only one using the toilet am i what there are no ground rules here we haven't
[12298.55s -> 12310.70s]  made them i'm not drinking salt water to hydrate i just is it safer to drink 16 ounces of salt water
[12310.70s -> 12318.50s]  or 16 ounces of water from a chlorinated shocked fucking pool they're both dangerous but which one
[12318.98s -> 12335.53s]  which one is worse pool is safer you know how much pool water i've gotten in my eyes and in my nose
[12335.53s -> 12348.92s]  and in my mouth i've drank probably four or five glasses of this water before and i'm all right no
[12348.92s -> 12357.54s]  i don't believe it this is the worst thing you can drink because there's mosquito eggs in like this
[12357.54s -> 12364.71s]  standing water standing lake water you just that's you could actually actually die this you're saying
[12364.71s -> 12369.99s]  it just it dehydrates you but if i'm not stranded on an island i would be safer drinking this and
[12370.07s -> 12377.53s]  then just drinking a glass of water and maybe like eating some bread or something the salt water
[12377.53s -> 12403.00s]  kills all the germs all right all right any that's done it's over it's over arrowhead arrowheads are
[12403.00s -> 12409.22s]  not better than evian and evian's not better than fiji and i love taking baths so that's this is
[12409.22s -> 12425.43s]  accurate i'm not drinking this you guys really gonna make me do this fine it's safer to drink
[12425.43s -> 12431.78s]  water out of your bathtub than any of these other things because who cares it's just a bathtub
[12431.78s -> 12437.22s]  there's nobody shits in their bathtub nobody pisses in their bathtub i like taking baths
[12437.22s -> 12459.29s]  it's not fair everyone pees in their bathtub so let's get this straight when i tell you that
[12459.29s -> 12464.47s]  i've peed in the shower before which to pee directly into a drain and you don't have to sit
[12464.47s -> 12470.26s]  in it that's weird but all of you guys are saying that you've pissed in your bathtub before where
[12470.26s -> 12480.49s]  you have to sit in your fucking bathtub and be surrounded by urine but you're not weird you're
[12480.49s -> 12498.74s]  you're not weird i'm weird if you pee directly into the drain if you pee directly into the drain
[12498.74s -> 12514.95s]  what's the difference yeah i just i need i want to know the difference what's the difference
[12514.95s -> 12519.45s]  after you take the bath you pee you're just sitting in a bath what are you talking about
[12519.45s -> 12544.38s]  this is done accurate you stand up and do it i'm never going to your house you put like the two or
[12544.38s -> 12547.34s]  three towels out for me and you put it on the bathtub and you just hang them over there and
[12547.34s -> 12557.13s]  you're like yeah you got a bathtub i'm not i'm not going in that bathtub bathtub is kind of just a
[12557.13s -> 12576.22s]  big urinal though i guess i get it i get it what's the next one i already did this one before i'm
[12576.22s -> 12599.38s]  gonna do it real quick who gets the coffee from all these places all right so this is what's your
[12599.38s -> 12623.29s]  favorite coffee just kidding where do you like what's your favorite fast food restaurant is
[12623.29s -> 12632.26s]  influencing all right that was fun what's this one all right i want i want to do this one i want to
[12632.26s -> 12641.93s]  do this one and then we're going back to diablo this is jim carrey movie the mask number one
[12641.93s -> 12652.89s]  all right jim carrey movies we've got ace ventura get up there where ace ventura uh two wait no no
[12652.89s -> 12660.89s]  where's ace ventura two ace ventura two is way better than one liar liar is all right let's go
[12660.89s -> 12664.95s]  dumb and dumber is really good i have not seen this i'm gonna put it down here
[12666.15s -> 12674.36s]  i didn't see this either all right he was in this it was all right didn't oh the number 23
[12674.36s -> 12683.88s]  here it is whatever ace ventura two when nature calls there it is bruce almighty is bruce almighty
[12683.88s -> 12696.50s]  was good what's this oh dumb and dumber two no uh kick-ass two does it count if i've never watched
[12696.50s -> 12713.34s]  kick-ass two i only watched jim carrey's scenes in the movie does it count no yeah mr poppin's
[12713.34s -> 12724.38s]  penguins didn't see it me myself and irene i mean it's a classic cable guy it's classic the majestic
[12724.38s -> 12737.32s]  the one with the other movie the movie theater one yes man the dumb and dumbers are backwards
[12739.03s -> 12753.42s]  oh yeah you're right batman forever s uh i didn't see this one i didn't see this one i didn't see
[12753.50s -> 12759.85s]  this one i didn't see this one christmas carol it's all right sonic the hedgehog movie we nobody's
[12759.85s -> 12770.25s]  seen it yet i haven't seen this one i don't know vermin show get up there man of the moon get up
[12770.25s -> 12781.29s]  there grinch it's all right i don't know oh no this uh fun with uh i didn't see it i didn't see
[12781.29s -> 12788.58s]  this one i don't even know what this one is i don't know this one is uh i don't know this one is uh
[12788.58s -> 12796.23s]  oh this is okay i don't know this one is i don't know this one is i don't know what this one is
[12796.23s -> 12803.90s]  all right let's get this right oh wait that was eternal sunshine where's where's eternal
[12803.90s -> 12820.55s]  where's eternal sunshine which one is it this one okay that's an accurate s tier
[12820.55s -> 12835.53s]  for jim carrey movies why would i put eternal sunshine next to the mask that's that's so far
[12835.53s -> 12841.96s]  below it that's better that's i mean that's that's inaccurate the mask is the best movie
[12841.96s -> 12859.94s]  that he's ever done it was incredible that everything we're gonna have to bump something
[12859.94s -> 12873.00s]  off i think no liar liar was good but i don't know if it was cable guy good the grinch goes
[12873.00s -> 12877.59s]  up no the grinch was like two hours too long you shaved like three and a half hours off that movie
[12877.59s -> 12909.26s]  and i would i would agree uh i like bruce almighty more than eternal sunshine what's the worst jim
[12909.26s -> 12930.44s]  carrey movie that i've seen i mean they're both not very good the grinch feels like it was a day
[12930.44s -> 12935.48s]  long yes that's what happens when you take an old fun children's story that was 12 minutes long and
[12935.48s -> 12954.10s]  you make it like a four and a half hour long movie remember that these are i just haven't seen these
[12954.10s -> 12961.14s]  so if you're like oh dark dark crimes that's great i just haven't seen it the upload two is in the
[12961.14s -> 12975.37s]  background it is that movie's an hour and 32 minutes thanks for proving my point that we all
[12975.37s -> 12979.99s]  of us thought we all thought it was like three and a half hours long again it was like three
[12979.99s -> 12995.42s]  hours too long great performance though it goes up fantastic performance by jim carrey preemptively
[12995.42s -> 13002.22s]  rate sonic s tier that's a safe bet i'm not sure that's a safe bet i would probably assume that
[13002.22s -> 13013.14s]  this is going to be up here somewhere though is is his dr egg man performance going to be as good
[13013.14s -> 13024.89s]  as his yes man performance that's to be seen yes man sucked well why do you think it's right
[13024.89s -> 13039.00s]  next to burt wonderstone i don't know maybe we'll see we'll see if it's a fun it's a fun
[13039.00s -> 13049.77s]  movie it could be fun it's one of the first jim carrey comedy kind of he's going back to comedy
[13049.77s -> 13053.85s]  it's been a while well dumb and dumber two was the last time he did he was in like a comedy movie
[13053.93s -> 13068.42s]  right in like three or four years and before that it was a while too six years remember the bad
[13068.42s -> 13074.66s]  taste in movies joke is getting old if you think that this belongs somewhere else besides s if you
[13074.66s -> 13082.14s]  think these three belong somewhere else i'm not sure what i don't know how to how to explain to
[13082.14s -> 13094.06s]  you these things this is like the required reading for jim carrey movies a s and a tier is required
[13094.06s -> 13104.86s]  jim carrey reading he almost got a academy award for this he got like a golden globe for man on
[13104.86s -> 13117.88s]  the moon it was great ace pentura is overrated i don't know i mean like the second one's the
[13117.88s -> 13128.73s]  first one is i like the second one better than the first one and eternal sunshine was i mean
[13128.73s -> 13133.77s]  whatever it's all right it's good he doesn't mean a bad movie he just means it's not it's not the
[13133.77s -> 13154.02s]  truman show there's your list and now let's do adam sam you don't mess with the zohan
[13154.74s -> 13167.59s]  happy gilmore s tier i saw this movie in the theaters me and burger boy saw this because we
[13167.59s -> 13171.59s]  were like oh this has to be like the worst movie ever and we it was hard for us to not get up and
[13171.59s -> 13177.53s]  leave we were just like let's go fucking watch this shitty movie and it was hard to say stay
[13177.53s -> 13184.90s]  and watch the whole thing the the only good part about that movie is the al pacino duncacino song
[13185.91s -> 13190.98s]  that's it so i don't go don't go don't i mean that's the only thing that was worth watching in the
[13190.98s -> 13196.46s]  whole movie the ad and it was just giant product placement i don't even care it was it was so
[13196.46s -> 13206.90s]  stupid don caccino is the only reason why that movie was even tolerable oh the gobbler no the
[13206.90s -> 13215.08s]  cobbler haven't seen it d is haven't seen it f is just like why if the first dates didn't see it i
[13215.08s -> 13222.36s]  didn't have a reason to see it oh this is this is a boston movie someone was like fucking talking
[13222.36s -> 13226.04s]  like fucking this all the fucking time this is a boston movie so it has to be at sea for me
[13229.26s -> 13240.63s]  um wedding singer was all right but i'm i really did i'm not like a huge wedding singer fan why is
[13240.63s -> 13264.31s]  hotel transylvania on here but not with eight crazy nights where is it all right i think this
[13264.31s -> 13284.14s]  is good big daddy better than uh yeah there we go that's accurate no uncut gems that movie just
[13284.14s -> 13295.99s]  came out like three months ago i didn't see this it's supposed to be kind of good i didn't see it
[13298.30s -> 13305.10s]  nothing comes close to happy gilmore no nothing does i would say the difference between the this
[13305.10s -> 13321.08s]  s tier and this a tier is probably it's probably like 60 feet probably like 70 feet actually that's
[13321.08s -> 13347.21s]  no that's great that's better zohan is beyond s tier all right let's go back to diablo 2
[13348.60s -> 13358.65s]  they're your tier list tier list hotel is not f tier no i hotel okay wait wait i didn't see that
[13358.81s -> 13364.49s]  okay i didn't see hotel transylvania i got upset that it was the only animated one on here um i
[13364.49s -> 13375.85s]  didn't i didn't see this i didn't you want me to put pixels anywhere besides f all right let's go
[13375.85s -> 13655.80s]  that's fun now i gotta pee so let's take the first break i'll be right back okay they're returned
[13655.80s -> 13679.70s]  i'm back what was the last thing we were doing in diablo i need to change the volume back to where
[13679.70s -> 13701.02s]  it was you can hear the game diablo tier list uh what all right i have the i gotta go to
[13701.02s -> 13710.78s]  provincial there's a little bit further up we gotta go to cuirass i didn't get the waypoint
[13711.58s -> 13727.05s]  i have to go up from the sewers yep anymore chests that's my favorite soap can you have a
[13727.05s -> 13748.28s]  favorite soap yes you can why uh i mean i guess there's so but there's so many that body of a
[13748.28s -> 13770.30s]  favorite soap like brand or flavor all right i need the tp here or the waypoint whatever all
[13770.30s -> 13788.44s]  right my favorite my favorite soap is probably uh i mean i i like i like lush's shampoo it's hard
[13788.44s -> 13817.22s]  to find i think my favorite actual so i don't know whatever whatever's on the rack at walmart
[13820.25s -> 13836.78s]  whatever i can just slime on my body and then shower it off irish spring i actually love irish
[13836.78s -> 13845.96s]  spring but kim hates it so anytime that i would want to use it kim is like no no do not
[13845.96s -> 13863.42s]  oh i don't use it anymore all right my weapon is broken it's all right i don't need to go back
[13864.14s -> 13866.44s]  it smells like chemicals
[13877.59s -> 13886.79s]  it does have a sort of a chemical smell it has a green chemical smell all right i need to get the
[13886.79s -> 13892.44s]  flail and prevention i gotta move actually i have this as long as i use it
[13895.70s -> 13898.34s]  don't go that fast don't go that fast it's seriously i don't have a weapon
[13898.34s -> 13908.33s]  and i'm in hardcore i forget that sometimes no i get off everything is made out of chemicals
[13909.83s -> 13918.25s]  yeah who repairs an act three it's still after yes we're getting to the end of act three
[13918.25s -> 13923.61s]  greeting we'll be at the end of act three after i get the flail we'll then be going to the durance
[13923.61s -> 13934.49s]  of hate and then be doing the most farmable thing in the game it used to be pinwheel not what's his
[13934.49s -> 13939.93s]  what's his name they nerfed him because it was so easy and what was it what was his name what's his
[13939.93s -> 13953.00s]  name his name is pendle or something right greetings here good day indel skin yeah you
[13953.00s -> 13961.08s]  used to be able to uh so there was this little mini boss in diablo 2 it was pendle skin uh he
[13961.08s -> 13967.42s]  was right next to the waypoint and you could kill him in one hit and he dropped in an amazing
[13967.42s -> 13972.70s]  drop table he had the same drop table as bosses so you would just remake a game kill him in one
[13972.70s -> 13976.30s]  second loot remake the game kill him in one second loot over and over again hundreds and hundreds of
[13976.30s -> 13990.30s]  times and then they nerfed it because it was way too easy to get anything and then i think that
[13990.30s -> 14006.82s]  they also nerfed mephisto too didn't they a long time ago they nerfed an easy to kill character
[14006.82s -> 14010.26s]  well they'd nerfed his loot table they made it so you didn't drop this thing
[14012.66s -> 14016.18s]  because i mean at some point people are just making in your battle net lobbies
[14016.18s -> 14024.10s]  a new game every five seconds or every 12 like 10 seconds to kill the same enemy and that's what
[14024.10s -> 14029.22s]  every single person is doing that's logged in at some point you look at that and go uh this is
[14029.22s -> 14038.60s]  kind of that's probably dumb we should probably do something about that do i eat mcdonald's it's
[14038.60s -> 14046.14s]  like one of my favorite places yes in fact i may even eat mcdonald's later because he just said
[14046.14s -> 14056.70s]  that you've influenced me influencer how would i know didn't you get banned oh what the fuck's
[14056.70s -> 14070.30s]  what happened that was weird what has happened huh yeah i lost chat too for like a second
[14071.18s -> 14077.14s]  it was like one tenth of a second almost hit travencel
[14086.54s -> 14098.50s]  yeah it was dead for a second this part is always such a pain in the ass but having
[14099.06s -> 14108.60s]  necromancer with summon is it's pretty great actually um do i like bath bombs yes i do but
[14108.60s -> 14116.60s]  one time probably two three months ago uh i did a bath bomb and i thought i had jaundice and i
[14116.60s -> 14124.49s]  freaked out and almost canceled the stream i was seconds away from canceling i think i actually did
[14124.49s -> 14128.33s]  cancel the stream i was like guys this is i gotta do something i gotta go i have to go to like the
[14128.33s -> 14154.95s]  doctor and i did like a mustard colored bath bomb and it stained my skin oh yeah almost went
[14154.95s -> 14160.25s]  to yeah we talked about it on the screen because we talked about if i had gone to the doctor
[14160.89s -> 14164.81s]  how horrible would that have been he would have been like what's wrong yeah i got i've got i've
[14164.81s -> 14168.57s]  got jaundice i'm not sure because we were talking about i've had i had like a liver scan and they
[14168.57s -> 14173.69s]  because remember when all these medical things were going on i had a liver scan so i'm sitting
[14173.69s -> 14181.45s]  there going uh-oh this is it this is it's my liver right as i go into the doctor and he takes
[14181.45s -> 14183.53s]  a napkin and just kind of wipes your skin
[14186.57s -> 14200.95s]  garamy what are you doing here uh the council can auto kill like you can automatically kill
[14203.29s -> 14208.33s]  have to be ready they sprint really fast and one of them has an insanely deadly move
[14210.17s -> 14222.68s]  you've got to be ready you're a hypochondriac yeah i that's what i'm saying it would have been
[14222.68s -> 14226.68s]  really really weird it would have been so hard to describe too it would have been like oh well
[14226.68s -> 14234.98s]  i have a liver scan coming up and i thought i had jaundice and i i don't i i should go
[14234.98s -> 14244.97s]  oh thanks all right we need to do a turban to waypoint usually pretty close usually
[14245.53s -> 14254.39s]  i'm gonna use that term pretty loosely because i am bad at this game you can see lots of fails
[14254.39s -> 14270.94s]  you're gonna see lots of triumph the council might get them no i don't think so if we come this far
[14271.58s -> 14279.61s]  i think it's gonna be something in act four that truly kills me if we've come so far i'm not sure
[14279.61s -> 14293.21s]  it's gonna be actually that doesn't act the ancients will get them yeah because i can't
[14293.21s -> 14299.45s]  leave that area i don't know it's going to be tricky i would be happy if i completed all the
[14299.45s -> 14309.21s]  normal on hardcore just because i've never done it before not that waypoint did i get it wait i
[14309.21s -> 14317.88s]  did get it didn't i it's right there any ftk news yes actually just had a meeting with the people
[14317.88s -> 14326.41s]  that are making it uh we are going to it's it's still being developed and it's going to be a lot
[14326.41s -> 14334.34s]  more we took all the feedback from everybody so it's gonna be a lot more it's not just gonna
[14334.34s -> 14340.02s]  be kind of random like hey leg let's go and i if you kill me kill me we're gonna be doing
[14340.02s -> 14348.70s]  lots of interesting things so it's not just gonna be a mess they just actually started working out
[14348.70s -> 14359.90s]  it again like as of tomorrow or like as of today and it's going to bleed into that server
[14360.95s -> 14365.43s]  after the next stream we're gonna do a couple of uh funds we're gonna do a couple of fun things
[14365.43s -> 14372.98s]  on stream and then that's going to turn into a 24 7 minecraft server at least for a little while
[14375.61s -> 14382.38s]  just for you guys to play on whoever wants to participate in that and i'm scared of doing
[14387.77s -> 14392.73s]  i cannot promise that that server will be available forever but i can tell you that
[14392.73s -> 14400.76s]  it will be available at least or i would assume a majority of 2020 all right here we go this is
[14400.76s -> 14406.04s]  the bad that these kill all right where are they where are they the hydra is the worst
[14406.04s -> 14410.28s]  i forgot about the hydras all right we gotta we gotta bait out some of the council members
[14413.45s -> 14422.01s]  all right stay back stay back stay back i with my i'm keeping my with this i'm not going in yet
[14425.78s -> 14450.36s]  i need a little mage did he explode where is it what's his body come on all right here they come

[14536.63s -> 14554.46s]  fresh bacon my favorite scent ah these things do so much damage you have no idea
[14555.26s -> 14562.44s]  we gotta pull another one out oh look at all that fire all right we got two we got two
[14563.16s -> 14573.54s]  there he is flame ringer come on vic look at vic doing work his colleagues play up
[14576.41s -> 14580.82s]  got it nothing from the council i think there's one more in here
[14581.46s -> 14594.68s]  holy fuck okay there's another named one in there uh my favorite smell odd questions tonight
[14599.43s -> 14604.94s]  she's right in front of me all right get it we need to get in here somebody's to kill him
[14605.74s -> 14619.98s]  they're doing it there's another one in here how many more people are in here
[14620.87s -> 14630.39s]  an am room it's not too rare but it's still pretty good who else is in here oh there's another one
[14635.19s -> 14641.83s]  this on hell or night and night and nightmare temple's dark power is broken is horrendous
[14644.31s -> 14653.51s]  all right i got the flail combine everything together come back break this and then we're
[14653.51s -> 14658.87s]  going to be almost a third act boss and then act four is actually very short once properly
[14658.87s -> 14666.90s]  imbued him's flail can destroy the compelling orb and reveal the way to mefisto place it
[14666.90s -> 14672.66s]  into the favorite scent okay it's gonna sound weird his heart is when you drive around the
[14672.66s -> 14681.40s]  back of a burger king then transmute them to carry out kalim's will ridding kurost of the council
[14681.40s -> 14692.12s]  of zakka room was essential that burger king exhaust is what i'm gonna call it
[14706.60s -> 14713.40s]  brands mute everything make kalim's will are spoilers that was called the eye brain the heart
[14713.40s -> 14722.39s]  in the flail kalim's will he can only use this the only thing that works to break
[14723.11s -> 14738.49s]  the orb to bring you to mefisto so we're making our way to the durance of hate let's sell some
[14738.49s -> 14747.16s]  shit diablo and bale have surely found the temple city by now they seek to free their brother
[14747.16s -> 14753.32s]  mefisto who was imprisoned by the haradrim in the temple my brothers will not die in vain
[14754.28s -> 14759.00s]  sorry i can do that better and prevent them from releasing hatred upon the world
[14763.78s -> 14787.74s]  my brothers will not die in vain one of my favorite lines bash the orb dude was that
[14787.74s -> 14802.09s]  what was that was was that was stuff speaking can we get a bugleberry emote uh the idea is
[14802.09s -> 14812.42s]  maybe to have like a 50 slot bugleberry yeah we're all out of here who's with me
[14813.22s -> 14829.13s]  oh me me me me all right let's go birds of hate level one search for mefisto in the durance of
[14829.13s -> 14844.49s]  hate when we find two i've got to find the uh waypoint mefisto right hopefully i don't
[14844.49s -> 14867.35s]  get instantly killed accidentally somehow is he gonna kill mefisto i don't know let's get lucky
[14867.35s -> 14873.29s]  and have it pop up right here that'd be great earns of hate level two come on it's been a while
[14873.29s -> 14880.31s]  since i've been in here so you know these memories are coming back this door runs for better gear
[14880.87s -> 14893.11s]  yeah what was the orange thing was a rune socket runes and if you do let's say you have a three
[14893.11s -> 14898.79s]  four five or six socket piece of gear there are words you can spell with the runes that make a
[14898.79s -> 14906.98s]  unique item something that they did not have in diablo 3 i don't i don't really know why
[14907.54s -> 14911.38s]  because people really liked it people thought it was one of the best parts about this game was
[14911.38s -> 14917.30s]  collecting runes and making rune words i don't know why they got rid of it and we got fucking
[14917.30s -> 14945.45s]  lucky hey otto what are you doing the oh diablo mega low three yeah i i'm not a i'm not a major
[14945.53s -> 14947.53s]  gigantic fan of diablo 3
[14949.99s -> 14957.75s]  i did think diablo 3 was fun to play but i didn't think it was fun to continue to play
[14964.14s -> 14974.34s]  the part the original is diablo 3 was eh it was good it was okay
[14974.82s -> 14982.71s]  okay they had like the most uninspiring shitty item system the abilities were fun to use
[14984.70s -> 14991.18s]  combat was fun although it was sort of a little it was a little uh the word i'm gonna use here
[14991.18s -> 14998.39s]  is like nose bleeding you know what i mean i'm gonna get that it was just like you just kind
[14998.39s -> 15005.03s]  of sit back and just get noses bleeding while you just click the same button and just stand
[15005.03s -> 15009.32s]  into a hallway and go a thousand boring
[15015.03s -> 15035.42s]  you mean brains yeah it's a little nose bleeding all right be careful i could die here fire protect
[15035.42s -> 15051.11s]  me at all costs losing people the iron golem is still pretty good though it wasn't all right
[15051.83s -> 15063.32s]  there were like three enemies in all of act one it's just i'm an item person i like collecting
[15063.32s -> 15074.22s]  items there was no reason to do that in diablo 3 every legendary was the same like it just had
[15074.22s -> 15082.25s]  hundreds of stats up it was just that was it and i also would and i know when they greet
[15082.25s -> 15087.82s]  yourselves came out they approved that game a lot but there's only so many band-aids you can put on
[15087.82s -> 15095.85s]  something before um you know you have to go to the hospital one of the things i really didn't
[15095.85s -> 15107.22s]  like about diablo 3 was grinding for legendaries and then rerolling stats it added that rng on top
[15107.22s -> 15118.54s]  of rng on top of rng it just was it was just a madness you had to roll you to get the item
[15118.54s -> 15123.74s]  and see what it rolled and then you had to reroll something on that item to be better for what you
[15123.74s -> 15128.86s]  wanted it for and then after that roll there was another roll to see what it rolled as
[15130.54s -> 15134.46s]  it was roll roll roll roll roll roll did you get what did you get max now you didn't it
[15134.46s -> 15143.94s]  was a shitty roll on that roll oh sorry you were looking for a plus 15 to uh to to fireball you
[15143.94s -> 15152.20s]  got eight you got 11 i have to do it again i'm being like what the fuck am i doing this for
[15157.24s -> 15183.67s]  i'm good looking for that weight thing you only have one point and summon resist
[15184.47s -> 15209.91s]  hey we're okay this way i also like putting points in too i know that some of the argument
[15209.91s -> 15215.59s]  against okay you have to you could put 20 skill points in that but it doesn't matter because if
[15215.59s -> 15220.15s]  it just was based on your level anyways you'd see it grow you don't have to put it but i like
[15220.23s -> 15229.00s]  putting points in it's fun for me it's scratches and itch for me every single move you have in
[15229.00s -> 15233.72s]  this game can have 20 skill points put into it by you something about it is i like it well here
[15233.72s -> 15242.68s]  we go but i need the waypoint am i gonna play diablo 4 i don't know a diablo 4 really does seem
[15242.68s -> 15250.09s]  like they weren't really ready at all for it they saw all the backlash that diablo immortal had
[15250.09s -> 15253.45s]  and they may have been developing it but then they're just like all right dude we gotta fucking do
[15253.45s -> 15260.94s]  something because this is not even close like hey we're gonna announce diablo 3 it's not even
[15260.94s -> 15266.84s]  close you maybe you'll see it eventually over the next few like three or four years i don't even
[15266.84s -> 15285.66s]  know who knows it might have happened for five years and it looked like diablo 3 to me just looked
[15285.66s -> 15292.28s]  like diablo 3 but they put it on another engine kind of let's put it this way i don't have very
[15292.28s -> 15298.60s]  much confidence that diablo 4 will be a very good game now would i like to be pleasantly surprised
[15298.68s -> 15313.18s]  yes but judging by the fact that in that first itemization preview it was red light green light
[15314.26s -> 15320.60s]  attack defense and they're going back to what why people didn't like diablo 3 in the first place
[15324.09s -> 15331.24s]  and it was i i want to make dumb choices i want to have i want to be able to put 20 fucking points
[15331.24s -> 15340.12s]  i want to have like a bunch of crazy uh fixes you know what i mean i was thinking something
[15340.12s -> 15345.72s]  i didn't like about diablo 3 was everything was tied to weapon damage like no i don't want to
[15345.72s -> 15354.55s]  just have it be uh like 800 weapon damage 1200 weapon damage 375 weapon damage
[15355.51s -> 15362.31s]  just made it too it just yeah it's too samey not only that when you make a character in
[15362.31s -> 15366.95s]  diablo 3 you don't have to make another one ever again if you make a barbarian in diablo 3 that's
[15366.95s -> 15370.95s]  the only character that's the only barbarian you're ever gonna make if you can just be anything you
[15370.95s -> 15378.87s]  just do anything am i ranting am i ranting right now i feel like i am like i'm ranting this is kind
[15378.87s -> 15395.45s]  of ranty but then you have to think back too right so this is like also important is a very
[15395.45s -> 15403.13s]  important part of this conversation the people that made this game none of them are even gonna
[15403.13s -> 15407.77s]  work on it you know what i mean it's this game was made by completely different fucking people
[15408.57s -> 15420.68s]  but 100 different dev team 100 so it's well i really wish we'd get like a true sequel to
[15420.68s -> 15424.92s]  diablo 2 the reason why we're never gonna get a true chrono trigger sequel because
[15424.92s -> 15437.82s]  none they're not they're never gonna be together again where is this waypoint it's like yeah but
[15437.82s -> 15445.19s]  like dozens of three done how did you know i was gonna say dozens of different companies and three
[15445.19s -> 15457.53s]  employees but i corrected myself and then i freaked out that's kind of the nature of
[15458.50s -> 15464.74s]  game development it's kind of a kind of like a sad annoying reality of the whole thing is a lot of
[15464.74s -> 15470.50s]  times when a game comes out there's a lot of just layoffs and changing and you go down all right
[15470.50s -> 15474.10s]  thanks for making that game uh 30 of you no longer work here and you're going to go to different
[15474.10s -> 15481.00s]  companies and we'll never be on the same team again like all of blizzard north was gone after
[15481.00s -> 15487.80s]  diablo 2 gone i don't nobody knows really what happened or why it's like blizzard north did not
[15487.80s -> 15493.32s]  exist anymore after this game may we even working i think on a prototype for diablo 3 and then it
[15493.32s -> 15499.54s]  was like no you're all gone there you go all right you're never gonna get that same it's like the
[15499.54s -> 15512.12s]  series is not even the same series it'd be like if i made a youtube video right let's say let's
[15512.12s -> 15518.20s]  say like tomorrow i upload a youtube video i'm like okay guys here's my next video it's been
[15518.20s -> 15524.92s]  it's been like four years since my latest youtube video check it out and it's another person
[15527.61s -> 15533.21s]  and they're going like hey man what's up it's germa985 here and i'm playing uh i'm playing
[15533.21s -> 15548.60s]  apex legends i feel like this is not even the same person i didn't make that video
[15549.32s -> 15562.02s]  there's even my video still this is even my channel still that's where it gets weird
[15562.66s -> 15569.38s]  because we're led to believe that all these things are sequels but it's like it's not even the same
[15569.38s -> 15580.14s]  people and eventually there it is because eventually i'll find this fucking waypoint
[15580.78s -> 15583.40s]  do miss piggy's shirt
[15605.43s -> 15609.45s]  all right are you guys ready to take on bathisto and maybe die
[15611.45s -> 15620.50s]  86 000 i should probably level up one more time before doing this
[15625.34s -> 15628.22s]  anything that's not a greater healing potion is getting sold
[15628.22s -> 15655.35s]  and even some of the greater hand just sell them once we get to nightmare you're gonna realize that
[15655.35s -> 15669.26s]  this was all not even worth doing but it's okay all right let's go did i redeem a wink
[15671.00s -> 15687.21s]  nah nah save it trust me save it nah save it save it save it save it you want to save it
[15688.33s -> 15701.67s]  we have to find another council by the way which sucks this one's arguably worse than the last one
[15702.31s -> 15718.54s]  you redeem it no you don't be so right about diablo you make me mad kill bathisto
[15719.34s -> 15726.31s]  i need to what's my lightning resistance not very good i have lots of cold but no lightning
[15727.19s -> 15736.09s]  lightning is so important here all right let's be careful here comes another council

[15788.39s -> 15794.39s]  even mafisto either this is gonna suck hopefully he drops the button oh ah the nerves are starting
[15794.39s -> 15829.70s]  to come up because this might this might be the end would be the end how is it no wink ray missed

[17718.97s -> 17723.85s]  but diablo has made his way to hell and it is likely that bale followed him there
[17723.85s -> 17727.21s]  diablo

[17978.87s -> 17986.18s]  this chest to open all the way in the back why you always carry keys because some of these
[17986.18s -> 17990.10s]  chest backs here that you see locked that's why you should have a key every time you do this
[17991.43s -> 18007.43s]  it would be something good in there very possible all right that's it pretty cool
[18008.31s -> 18014.33s]  hey i love these chill laid back streams lately yeah it's good to take a little bit of a

[18313.14s -> 18321.40s]  of thousands of champions of the light yourself now the final battle against the prime evils
[18321.40s -> 18329.19s]  draws near to face it alone i have been forbidden to aid you directly well it's actually gonna be

[18497.58s -> 18501.98s]  want him to die i am gonna gamble though let's do like a weapon or something anything because
[18501.98s -> 18507.43s]  right i mean this is not i'm in hell this is not going to do anything half the people

[18514.20s -> 18530.79s]  like i don't know these by heart let me take a look double two rune words cheating that was a
[18530.79s -> 18539.18s]  knot how does the epic game store come up when you type in diablo two rune words that makes no sense
[18540.14s -> 18560.10s]  all right rune words we need okay three socket shield no scepter weapon three socket sword
[18561.74s -> 18568.62s]  to make this king's grace three socket sword or scepter is am ral and ful i don't have ful yet
[18568.62s -> 18584.46s]  though but that's a lot it's a lot of cool shit there's also leaf two sockets stave two socket
[18584.46s -> 18598.65s]  helm is orton soul those are kind of rare two socket helm nef and tier rhyme is shale and f but
[18598.65s -> 18607.18s]  shale is actually is not easy to find i don't have shale it's pretty good what about uh stealth
[18607.18s -> 18615.61s]  yeah talon f two socket body armor that's good but let's poison resist though
[18616.57s -> 18622.36s]  dexterity and poison resist and then a bunch of running and fat you run like really fast
[18623.32s -> 18642.34s]  that's not like not for me tier and l wouldn't be bad am and tier is called strength all right well
[18642.34s -> 18649.66s]  first of all i need to get something that has a socket in it two socket wand dull and low i don't
[18649.66s -> 18662.98s]  have those did you remember any advice um yeah i would probably i would probably try to tell

[18689.03s -> 18718.22s]  let's try to find a uh a two socket two sockets holy shit these are so bad sockets don't buy low
[18718.22s -> 18731.14s]  level garbage well i need something i could go kill uh i could go kill leg on dariel again
[18733.05s -> 18749.38s]  it needs to be white for room words well it has to be gray that's sockets all right let's just take
[18749.38s -> 18773.64s]  a walk outside try to just have anything drop we're not five forward now so oh boy all right

[18889.37s -> 18900.28s]  rare and that will make this a sixth of dexterity plus 15 max stamina 30 percent poison resist
[18901.64s -> 18910.62s]  regenerate 15 man a 25 percent faster run 25 faster hit recovery do a countess run
[18916.50s -> 18940.23s]  damn it that was like opening a present holy shit okay tal f here we go al f all right nice
[18941.32s -> 18968.23s]  stealth i run very fast now uh yeah i do 25 faster run very cool all right now what about a weapon
[18968.23s -> 18981.00s]  we're looking for a two or three socket weapon three socket weapon is venom but i don't have it
[18981.72s -> 18995.53s]  i think that's the easiest thing i can make uh if i find if i'm gonna do malice i need if lf

[19055.70s -> 19065.50s]  insane king's grace okay let's move still no fire resistance fantastic i'm in hell
[19066.06s -> 19076.94s]  yeah you just have to explore he knows all the voice lines but doesn't know how socketing works
[19076.94s -> 19082.46s]  well i didn't i know how socketing works i don't i didn't memorize every rune word in diablo 2
[19083.42s -> 19111.13s]  shit is gonna take a while little sorry pick three two data here only oh you get two skill points
[19111.13s -> 19149.80s]  for killing his wall by the way very useful he's an eye for socketed weapons i do move so fast
[19149.80s -> 19167.98s]  all right this is where i get the first test here oh he's gonna die where is he he's fighting
[19167.98s -> 19186.30s]  by himself where is he he's over here but he's alive he's alive okay where oh i'm all right
[19198.41s -> 19202.25s]  what's that fire still have no fire
[19206.25s -> 19209.45s]  the one place i really need it is where we are standing right now

[19258.47s -> 19274.09s]  bone walls are just to troll people in pvp lobbies let's see sort of accurate
[19279.22s -> 19292.07s]  this really is a big game his weapon he's just doing so what's he doing 53 to 99
[19293.11s -> 19297.59s]  and look at his resistances they're all maxed out wait do you have fire resistance on any of
[19297.59s -> 19307.94s]  shit no you just have it because you're better than me oh i'm also not sure why i keep casting
[19307.94s -> 19329.46s]  bone shield considering there's one point in it begged us for bone shield i did beg you for bone
[19329.46s -> 19375.59s]  shield and you only gave me one skill point i can't even get two stop crying frame oh it's
[19375.59s -> 19385.86s]  because they're oops i just trapped my goal and killed them champions in here that's why
[19385.86s -> 19396.94s]  oh
[19402.44s -> 19405.14s]  nothing a lot of nothing
[19413.98s -> 19424.41s]  stand in front of that is well it's pretty close after you go right down
[19425.13s -> 19429.74s]  yeah you go to plains of despair it's the next level down and he's usually just right there
[19429.74s -> 19448.02s]  three two skill points we're gonna need to use them wisely regular skull nice
[19448.74s -> 19462.54s]  so yeah it's at this point i need to start to really pay attention we're going focus
[19462.54s -> 19487.21s]  mode for a little bit until we get close still everybody right yeah thankfully i can hurt you
[19487.21s -> 19492.22s]  guys because they're not fire resistant well so the people are here though
[19505.48s -> 19514.60s]  i am definitely going to do this though a couple of times try to farm out some uh

[19613.11s -> 19624.89s]  already he already is i need strength let's hold on to this until i can find it oh you don't it's

[19834.52s -> 19839.22s]  oh it could be a little confusing just based on the fact that i'm running around with
[19839.22s -> 19857.74s]  10 random people this amplified damage has such a low radius that i have to cast it five times
[19858.78s -> 19873.08s]  it's like two yards found it all right all right as well give me those two skill points
[19879.58s -> 19899.51s]  dude imagine he sneezed two nights these guys suck too playing through this bear

[20892.10s -> 20899.32s]  against them now the stones powers are combined powers of the soul stones under their control
[20899.32s -> 20902.76s]  don't know i know the first line of every single one of these will be able to turn the mortal
[20902.76s -> 20910.09s]  because i've played this game hundreds of hundreds and hundreds of times
[20910.09s -> 20919.77s]  and most of the time the dialogue goes like this long ago i swore i don't know the rest of it
[20919.77s -> 20926.50s]  i just know the first line and i've heard that first line from every character
[20927.22s -> 20941.90s]  probably 2000 times all right this thing sucks one to 54 no junk two skill points bow

[20991.06s -> 20995.59s]  all right we have two points to spend in fact i'm gonna hold off on this
[20995.59s -> 20999.43s]  because we're gonna have three points to spend so we're gonna do that first
[21000.07s -> 21019.78s]  i'm gonna keep moving uh where was that was down here right i found the other place to go

[23011.50s -> 23022.18s]  awful it's just how is it with um bubble tape well i thought for a second i was like why isn't
[23022.18s -> 23029.27s]  this a bubble tape on it i'm only doing this because juicy fruit only lasts like eight
[23029.27s -> 23049.24s]  seconds that's the best tasting gum why is this on here oh you know i i think nicorette gum
[23049.24s -> 23080.34s]  belongs in s tier this is nicotine gum supplement orbits too basic the double bubble jug plus they
[23080.34s -> 23088.38s]  try too hard with their commercials gum doesn't clean your mouth so people like oh it's like
[23088.38s -> 23098.34s]  brushing your fucking teeth it's not it's like xylitol right whatever the sugar is
[23099.22s -> 23118.25s]  winter fresh i don't like the peppermint kind of gums i don't know what these are i don't know
[23118.25s -> 23123.61s]  what this is air breath i don't know what these are and then this is just gumballs gumballs
[23123.61s -> 23133.29s]  are pretty good actually can you do how it feels to five gum impression yeah sure
[23133.29s -> 23158.84s]  i think that's accurate wait now it is i'm not i don't i'm not a big mint gum person very cool
[23158.84s -> 23169.78s]  here it is big league chew is the best bubble tape juicy fruit double bubble gumballs from
[23169.78s -> 23176.71s]  the gum bubble machine 5g gum and then the rest of this we're pretending that we clean your teeth
[23176.71s -> 23186.31s]  and please stop smoking cigarettes i already got that one this one here the way that my my this is
[23186.79s -> 23196.25s]  the way that my my this is who would win in a who would win a fight food mascot combat prowess
[23203.53s -> 23219.34s]  they're all cartoon characters they don't they can't what do you mean wrong one well he's well
[23219.34s -> 23232.90s]  he's already dead so he doesn't make it he's already dead right sonny's sonny's cuckoo you
[23232.90s -> 23242.44s]  always got to watch out the guy that's willing to do whatever you just stomp on this
[23244.44s -> 23256.18s]  and it would just insta die all right it would just be a big tire mark footprint on this same
[23256.18s -> 23260.58s]  through this fucking glove we'll put out get let's okay let's go all the glove based
[23263.35s -> 23274.38s]  did you they're done you just rip them in half same with this like this is you're you're just a
[23274.38s -> 23282.20s]  piece of cereal you're gonna get stepped on in the fight this is the son i don't know who else
[23282.20s -> 23292.34s]  compares to that this is a baby i think the baby actually might be a baby would actually be able
[23292.34s -> 23301.88s]  to take on the gloves because the gloves can't do anything all right now let's let's do let's do
[23301.88s -> 23309.48s]  humans just like just humans okay is the king supposed to be a human chef boyard he's a human
[23310.04s -> 23319.58s]  is that all right this is a human oh that's not a human that's not a human i thought it was i
[23319.58s -> 23325.88s]  don't know why i thought that okay we didn't get this dog could be classified as a human
[23325.88s -> 23344.12s]  we need real all right this is a human this is a human this is a human in a costume small human
[23345.19s -> 23360.65s]  also small human green huge green human okay okay also human human except this this one has a gun
[23363.72s -> 23379.99s]  right this is supposed to be like a revolutionary guy but it doesn't look like a musket he doesn't
[23379.99s -> 23391.62s]  have like this guy's a musket right all right Ronald McDonald's a human all humans have to be
[23391.62s -> 23399.82s]  on the same tier because there's no they would Wendy's a human this is also cute there's a furry
[23399.82s -> 23409.24s]  right that's a human there's an anthropomorphic human uh no that's no no no no no no i just saw
[23409.24s -> 23420.98s]  the pants and shit this is also a dog okay dog cookie okay baby eats cookie
[23422.90s -> 23450.87s]  cookie stains gloves that's Julius Caesar i don't know who this is but it looks like a person is
[23450.87s -> 23458.86s]  it a person i think that's a human Count Dracula is a fucking creep but he's a human
[23462.44s -> 23477.38s]  and he's like Dracula's cousin so he goes over here all right now we do now it's animals no no
[23478.34s -> 23493.02s]  humans dog bigger dog obviously goes in front this is a cheetah so she's deadly
[23494.06s -> 23501.51s]  all right now we've got Pillsbury Doughboy would just get rolled over someone would step on him
[23502.55s -> 23517.27s]  these guys are supposed to be little right this is a bee but a bee would would just be able to get
[23517.27s -> 23528.81s]  just hit and knocked out by any human polar bear who know hold on we're just gonna get this right
[23528.89s -> 23537.82s]  frog would be down here this is like a wolf or something all right frog versus baby would a
[23537.82s -> 23542.06s]  baby accidentally kill a frog right if there was like a fight going on the baby would just like
[23544.55s -> 23558.71s]  and like roll over in the frog all right fragile but made out of glass so it's got to go higher
[23558.71s -> 23564.31s]  and this is yeah this would this would take this is taking somebody with him
[23565.03s -> 23570.18s]  what do you mean yes he's fragile he's made out of glass this is a big glass pitcher
[23572.09s -> 23576.33s]  all the all the Quaker Oats guy has to do is use the butt of his rifle and
[23577.77s -> 23591.30s]  and shatter him it's fragile he's made of glass he breaks through walls he literally runs through
[23591.30s -> 23609.37s]  walls it's just an owl little dog eats owl no actually owls owls are vicious this is just
[23609.37s -> 23615.85s]  a rabbit I don't be this would be if this would be a tough fight a chihuahua versus a bunny rabbit
[23615.85s -> 23635.91s]  would be that would I don't know bunny no I don't know chihuahuas don't chihuahuas
[23635.91s -> 23664.38s]  just kind of go like this what is this Captain Crunch is canonically microscopic well let's
[23664.38s -> 23669.67s]  let me just this is a big one let me get over this first what is this what is that an animal
[23669.67s -> 23680.06s]  it's a dinosaur I don't recognize a dinosaur all right it goes up here the bear another rabbit
[23681.02s -> 23711.96s]  they're both even doing the same move the Trix rabbit's a predator but okay okay hold on I
[23711.96s -> 23716.68s]  think that I think the Nesquik bunny would would beat the shit out of the Trix rabbit
[23720.31s -> 23725.99s]  they both do the same moves though it's hard they both do like when when the Nesquik rabbit
[23725.99s -> 23731.83s]  sucks up the Nesquik his ears go in a circle around and then when he eats the Trix it goes
[23733.13s -> 23736.09s]  and they wrap it they both do the same move they both move said it's a mirror match
[23736.65s -> 23751.54s]  that's too tricky I don't know this is a rooster I don't know probably down here somewhere this is
[23751.54s -> 23760.73s]  a regular dog all right wait wait wait okay Keebler elf would get stung by the bee and be and it would
[23760.73s -> 23765.21s]  spear him through his chest so he would die it would spear him directly through his heart
[23766.17s -> 23776.52s]  same with these three and a baby a baby okay the baby's leveling up
[23777.32s -> 23792.73s]  but the baby might accidentally eat the bee though okay also these guys tiny right
[23796.55s -> 23810.82s]  snap crackle they like this big yeah bee also kills these three this is a stork all right the
[23810.82s -> 23825.32s]  birds over here the M&Ms all right uh Tony the tiger tiger versus cheetah now that's tricky
[23825.96s -> 23839.64s]  this is just okay this is an apple this is an apple and a cinnamon stick at least the glove can
[23839.64s -> 23856.46s]  grab and squish and crush what am I thinking yeah the glove the hamburger helper could like wrap
[23856.46s -> 23862.14s]  around his neck and just start squeezing all right same here this would be tough because he has teeth
[23868.68s -> 23884.95s]  I think they lose to the frog though the frog destroys him but also he's made out of he's made
[23884.95s -> 23893.08s]  out of he's made out of like polyester the green giant is 55 feet tall we'll get to it
[23893.08s -> 23902.34s]  we're gonna get to it I don't know eat more chicken is this supposed to be just a cow
[23902.34s -> 23916.54s]  it's a cow right and these are just M&Ms but they're kind of big though they're bigger than
[23916.54s -> 23931.34s]  the rabbits and bigger than the chihuahuas human size they're like this big they're like two or
[23931.34s -> 23938.57s]  three feet tall all right let's think about this some nothing can compete with the sun
[23939.45s -> 23948.23s]  is that this is a dinosaur all right green giant you said he's 55 feet tall
[23949.27s -> 23966.95s]  that's just pure size no one can compare oh shit sorry yeah nobody can compare if you're 55 feet
[23966.95s -> 23977.70s]  tall the dinosaur would be tricky but this is like a friendly happy dinosaur this is not like a t-rex
[23977.70s -> 23985.88s]  right but this is also this this is the jolly green giant I don't know that's they're the same
[23986.84s -> 24012.86s]  remember the dinosaur is the size of a macaroni noodle oh it's the craft dinosaur all right you
[24012.86s -> 24019.75s]  actually these two actually can't do anything they just sit there they can't even move you guys are
[24019.75s -> 24027.10s]  all the way down here with this with the shit that is inanimate this would be a hard fight
[24032.70s -> 24047.02s]  please caesar has a massive army at his disposal out in 2020 well if we're judging if we're going
[24047.02s -> 24060.60s]  by that then these two are dead then these two are dead this is no no no no no by the way this
[24060.60s -> 24075.58s]  is little caesar he's like a foot tall I forgot he does have he does have a weapon though little
[24075.58s -> 24090.04s]  caesar is like a foot tall and he has a weapon he might not this the stork might beat him I'm
[24090.04s -> 24112.15s]  not sure little caesar can go up his dog or the bigger birds all right hold on let's get this
[24112.15s -> 24118.86s]  right you don't belong up here although you do crash through build it you like he like breaks
[24118.86s -> 24134.62s]  through like building walls and shit nobody else does that I think he actually might be stronger
[24146.49s -> 24156.12s]  tiger or cheetah probably tiger polar bear or cheetah polar bear sunny the cuckoo bird
[24156.76s -> 24171.37s]  or cheetah tuna fish or cheetah bear bear wolf wolf owl they're both fucked but I don't know
[24171.37s -> 24186.36s]  tuna versus cheetah you know no but okay wait but if we I don't let's I don't know
[24187.24s -> 24194.39s]  no tuna versus bear the tuna is huge they weigh like two thousand they weigh like three thousand
[24194.39s -> 24201.66s]  pounds if a tuna just swims really fast it's like it's like a mack truck running into you
[24202.62s -> 24213.96s]  no they're not well it's a blue whale whatever he's blue tuna's not fucking blue I don't wear
[24213.96s -> 24226.31s]  glasses either bear versus cheetah bear polar bear versus just regular bear this is a grizzly bear
[24226.31s -> 24240.70s]  what kind of bear is he no polar bear polar bear or tiger it's probably tiger the tigers are huge
[24240.70s -> 24251.67s]  and they're deadly tuna versus wolf all right this is where it gets I don't know if a wolf would
[24251.75s -> 24276.34s]  kill a tuna that had to be done it's just too powerful it's too many powers okay this is uh
[24276.34s -> 24284.62s]  let's get to the humans also two feet tall he is and he like two feet no no he's not he's just
[24284.62s -> 24292.47s]  kind of like he's just kind of a regular dude how I think most people could probably beat up a cow
[24293.51s -> 24303.83s]  in fact he's super old yeah he is old what I don't know what this guy is what is this thing
[24314.57s -> 24325.16s]  wario what is that that's john what a burger right what is he superhero is he just a guy in
[24325.16s -> 24348.50s]  a suit I don't get it what is he he's a superhero I'm not sure he well superhero but what are his
[24348.50s -> 24356.31s]  powers eating a shitload of calories like what do you how are you a hamburger how are you a hamburger
[24356.31s -> 24363.59s]  superhero ronald mcdonald is a hamburger character but he's not a superhero what does that even mean
[24376.58s -> 24380.18s]  yeah he can fly and he has super strength what do we know that though
[24381.30s -> 24393.06s]  or is this just somebody is this just a cosplay yes it's canon so then he has to be up here
[24393.86s -> 24403.02s]  if you're a superhero then you're up here if you can fly and super strength like obviously
[24403.02s -> 24408.52s]  you're going to be next to the guy that can crash through walls I still don't think he would win
[24409.08s -> 24417.26s]  maybe he would but I don't I'm not going to give it to him all right the king
[24418.22s -> 24433.46s]  just a guy these are all just humans wendy I think wrong okay this guy's got a gun so he's
[24433.46s -> 24447.16s]  always up at the top in fact he might be above the birds oh shit he might actually be above
[24447.16s -> 24466.20s]  tony the tiger he's got his revolutionary musket he would just shoot these people
[24468.02s -> 24484.38s]  what quaker a member of the religious society of friends that's a real name
[24486.28s -> 24492.98s]  religious society of friends a christian movement founded by george fox devoted to
[24492.98s -> 24498.42s]  peaceful principles central to the quaker's belief is the doctrine of the inner light
[24499.30s -> 24526.31s]  they're past the pacifists the fucking pacifist well then you're gonna get you're gonna get
[24527.35s -> 24536.97s]  bit to death by the apple good for you in this battle of all wits and skills the glove is
[24536.97s -> 24545.11s]  gonna just like suffocate you whatever the peanut would choke him peanuts dead he died he died
[24546.07s -> 24567.77s]  today he died this afternoon the rest of this is just like who got the first point I mean this
[24567.77s -> 24571.69s]  is this is this guy's all the way to the bottom is it you know how hard it is to be in one of
[24571.69s -> 24583.54s]  these suits it's hard for Mickey Mouse to even lean down and give you a hug in this he'd get
[24583.78s -> 24603.51s]  get mauled by the rooster maybe uh you lose to a dog you would he said he said captain crunches
[24603.51s -> 24610.04s]  is like it's like this no he's not there's like children in those commercials this would be a
[24610.04s -> 24639.22s]  fight no there's no way you lose you lose uh king this is just another person in a costume
[24640.18s -> 24655.75s]  why is wendy so strong if she pushed you just you push an old man down he's gonna die
[24656.79s -> 24675.91s]  he's all old men and these people are two feet tall how big is what is a king to a god a vampire
[24675.91s -> 24689.82s]  can't die i feel like this owl would just shred him up he's just still a person wait he can turn
[24689.82s -> 24707.67s]  to a bat yeah that's fine you're old you're old you're old ronald mcdonald though
[24716.31s -> 24721.43s]  how old is how old is wendy is when he's supposed to be like 12 or like 15 or something how old is
[24721.43s -> 24754.97s]  wendy just like 50 no i mean like now everybody's gonna throw haymakers i don't know if you're
[24756.01s -> 24760.09s]  fighting an owl though i feel like you you you'd probably win but you'd get
[24760.09s -> 24785.08s]  fucked up these are all the people that would lose to the to a vicious owl i mean if you were
[24785.08s -> 24804.18s]  big enough it how big is wendy is she like five four feet tall all right this is more accurate
[24804.18s -> 24808.90s]  the elderly would not you think chef boyardee is going to get attacked by a fucking owl
[24810.63s -> 24849.38s]  he's these guys they're they're toast donald sanders makes chicken for a living he kills
[24849.38s -> 24856.82s]  all birds but if he were face to face with a giant bird he's going to lose
[24857.94s -> 24871.19s]  he also walks around with a cane if you think that a giant fucking bird is not going to beat
[24871.19s -> 24883.50s]  colonel sanders this is just going to can open his head it's a hidden weapon cane that's not
[24883.50s -> 24904.02s]  part of any lore that's not true that's not part of any lore i think this is legit
[24904.66s -> 24937.26s]  hmm the dog might just okay wait the dog we're leveling dog up and cow little caesar has a spear
[24937.26s -> 24948.01s]  why is he so low because he's this big he's this big that spear is the equivalent of you getting
[24948.01s -> 24962.62s]  stabbed from the end of a straw and how much weight do you think he can put behind that spear
[24963.58s -> 24973.99s]  this guy weighs like 14 pounds you think he's going to be able to skewer you with a spear this
[24973.99s -> 24994.47s]  big and he's 14 pounds and he's eating he's currently eating always and his eyes are closed
[24998.60s -> 25007.56s]  you're going to be scared of that guy everybody else here has their eyes open he's the only one
[25007.56s -> 25038.44s]  that's not prepared also the only one currently eating quicker has god to back him up but he can
[25038.44s -> 25045.50s]  open his eyes he's eating a pizza every time you've ever seen little caesar ever he's been
[25045.50s -> 25050.46s]  consuming a pizza he's what he thinks he's going to lose that during a fight no this is that's his
[25050.46s -> 25060.12s]  lore that's what he does he's going to be eating a pizza why is quaker all the way quaker is a
[25060.20s -> 25071.96s]  pacifist i've got yelled at for this he might be able to he might be able to kill the rats all
[25071.96s -> 25084.26s]  right fine quaker has old man strength all right he would accidentally fucking step on some of
[25084.26s -> 25091.66s]  these things yeah okay they can eat right like of course they could they can eat he can eat
[25091.66s -> 25097.42s]  cookies he can eat bread he could eat apples all right he would eat he can eat he would eat these
[25097.42s -> 25102.78s]  guys if he like if he maybe he wouldn't know they were people and he ate them i don't know
[25108.54s -> 25112.71s]  what about the glove this glove can't do anything it doesn't have fingers all this thing can do is
[25112.71s -> 25122.52s]  scream at least these other things have arms or legs it's in a series of armless legless
[25123.24s -> 25128.14s]  faces that will just scream they're all in a row they're all in the same level
[25128.14s -> 25148.60s]  oh this thing might be punching and kicking and punching but the glove kills him the glove
[25148.60s -> 25166.20s]  just wraps around his neck don't underestimate the cinnamon toast crunch guys yeah that's true
[25167.00s -> 25172.57s]  that's yeah this he can't do anything they would just stick their fingers in his eyes over and over
[25172.57s -> 25187.62s]  again until he passed out or something i don't know still on diavolo 2 yeah we're probably
[25187.62s -> 25200.02s]  gonna call it here in a little bit turkey fried chicken presents the kernel of two worlds volume
[25200.02s -> 25211.35s]  one one and mr peanut's already dead please remember there's a literal baby above eat here
[25211.35s -> 25222.31s]  okay now explain to me how a a baby would not be able to defeat somebody that is an inch tall
[25225.30s -> 25280.50s]  or a single bee or a frog so the glove is gonna be taco bell dog but yeah but okay so but
[25282.89s -> 25289.69s]  but the the quaker guy here's the wall this is the problem the baby is the wall because
[25290.49s -> 25299.53s]  anything below baby needs to be able to be killed or defeated by being rolled over accidentally
[25299.53s -> 25314.26s]  everything else on this list it could the quaker guy does not that doesn't fit that category all
[25314.26s -> 25335.70s]  right quaker beats baby glove chokes quaker bunny rabbit eats glove done glove would just no it
[25335.70s -> 25343.59s]  wouldn't no no but it wouldn't though it wouldn't no it wouldn't no it wouldn't no it wouldn't
[25343.59s -> 25375.75s]  it wouldn't it just this is a pacifist no no i can't have that quakers used to hunt
[25375.75s -> 25382.54s]  so they have a gun thank you very much so he goes back to where he was before
[25383.18s -> 25401.22s]  but they don't shoot people but what's the all right so they hunt but they don't hunt
[25401.22s -> 25408.12s]  they're a pacifist but they they they shoot stuff they don't if chef boyardee sprinting at the
[25408.12s -> 25420.44s]  quaker in a full fucking sprint with a hatchet in his hand is he going to shoot him is the answer
[25420.44s -> 25454.44s]  no that would go against the ideology the answer is no and he's he's getting strangled by the glove
[25476.78s -> 25489.96s]  the quaker wouldn't kill the quaker wouldn't kill any the quaker oh he won't kill anything else he
[25489.96s -> 25515.21s]  won't attack but he'll attack a baby like that's not accurate the baby baby baby attacks quaker
[25516.09s -> 25531.14s]  yes defeats quaker glove defeats baby be yeah a quaker would like oops
[25532.18s -> 25545.64s]  how does baby kill quaker do you understand this is a paradox how does baby kill quaker how does
[25545.64s -> 25561.48s]  quaker kill baby paradox he wouldn't fight so he would die he wouldn't fight so he wouldn't kill
[25562.20s -> 25583.10s]  you understand the paradox here he'd be outlived all right that's fair all right let's go let's
[25583.10s -> 25604.70s]  it i'm done quaker in his own tier no he's just a guy baby starves to death no baby eats bee baby
[25604.70s -> 25610.76s]  eats keibler elf no no this has nothing to do with eating people this is fighting right this
[25610.76s -> 25619.43s]  is nothing to do with eating anybody all right that's it all right what no no no there it is
[25619.99s -> 25646.30s]  there's your there's your tier list for mascot combat prowess lower the tuna you think you
[25646.30s -> 25653.66s]  hold you think a tuna a huge ass tuna is not going to be stronger than just a person if you
[25653.66s -> 25667.30s]  are in the water with a fucking tuna you're in trouble what are you gonna do what do you mean
[25667.30s -> 25714.44s]  google i know what a tuna is i eat it all the time are they fishing or are they just fighting
[25714.44s -> 25728.71s]  and where's the what where what's the arena is this wendy home turf or is this star kiss tuna
[25728.71s -> 25736.90s]  guy home turf because it's wildly different either way is this on land he walks on land
[25737.62s -> 25779.08s]  how big is he average tuna length 15 feet fucking tall get out of here guys give me a break
[25779.96s -> 25800.14s]  this guy's 15 feet tall the average length of a tuna is 15 feet huge that's not an eel that's the
[25800.22s -> 25809.69s]  star kissed tuna guy he loses to a wolf no he doesn't he's 15 feet tall
[25811.38s -> 25828.46s]  how he he doesn't lose account count draculis still kills him though no he doesn't okay that's
[25828.46s -> 25853.13s]  good i'm done all right let's go beat diablo he's small in the commercials no that's it i'm good
[25853.13s -> 25874.71s]  that's that's the one we're good that was a good one river of flame this is the where the game is
[25874.71s -> 25889.22s]  gonna start to cross into the last part of act four the hell is that we're gonna have to break
[25889.22s -> 25911.59s]  the soul stone i have it with me right yep hurry up and die i want more clear lists
[25913.83s -> 25922.28s]  we're actually probably gonna end it here pretty soon i might not get to diablo tonight
[25922.28s -> 25927.50s]  we'll probably can it for tonight soon after yeah yeah yeah let we're not gonna do another
[25927.50s -> 25936.70s]  10 plus hour screen today well we'll can it after uh we do the soul stone that'll bring

[26004.70s -> 26008.70s]  something else too we are officially i believe
[26029.32s -> 26040.33s]  one socket terrible terrible all right don't get trapped here
[26044.41s -> 26053.45s]  all right would you guys get mad at me if i like didn't the pistol like five times off stream

[26223.59s -> 26225.19s]  and tell him germa said
[26225.19s -> 26235.43s]  that's right let's break this and see if we get very good

[26383.69s -> 26407.70s]  gonna do it until this character dies whatever that is all right i've got uh too much shit too
[26407.70s -> 26431.14s]  many gems how many ruins all right guys we are probably about an hour and a half but we're
[26431.54s -> 26439.13s]  depending on probably like an hour or so away from diablo and i am i have second thoughts on
[26439.13s -> 26447.91s]  if it's going to be possible so we're going to try again move the skull before you leave
[26448.63s -> 26464.57s]  pretty good but i actually i am kind of hungry and i do uh want to get some sleep last night
[26464.57s -> 26469.37s]  we did it for about 10 plus hours but i don't really want to do a 10 hour stream right this
[26469.37s -> 26475.13s]  moment i want to eat i haven't really eaten that much today i want to get food and then it's about
[26475.13s -> 26483.26s]  10 11 o'clock coming on 10 o'clock pacific it's a good time to end it let's all go to taco bell

[26511.91s -> 26520.86s]  some other co-op stuff who knows we made pretty good progress two more difficulties that's true
[26520.86s -> 26531.29s]  but when you get to i should have decent items what about bail oh yeah i'm gonna if this character
[26531.29s -> 26550.57s]  stays alive it stays alive what if joel doesn't do it again then it's diablo week no no tommy

[26747.06s -> 26750.98s]  not carrying the cube on you for extra inventory space it takes up four slots but can hold more
[26750.98s -> 26755.94s]  than the space it takes up i know it's just an aesthetic thing it's just i don't like the way
[26755.94s -> 26765.27s]  it looks in the inventory clutter like having 16 mana potions and 12 healing potions five different
[26765.27s -> 26773.06s]  keys i know it's a hypocritical thing i know ask name thanks for the 1500 bits has been

[26813.45s -> 26818.73s]  rarely able to watch your streams as a european your stream times are late at night i especially
[26818.73s -> 26822.65s]  regret missing the simpsons stream blah blah blah i don't care about this message
[26823.37s -> 26837.77s]  that's so stupid i know i and i see it i read it and it's just i know no no no no no i do
[26840.06s -> 26848.01s]  i don't don't ever apologize for not coming to a stream it lasts a long time but ever since moving
[26848.01s -> 26857.06s]  to the west coast yes the eu that's why i brought the stream back to two three fourish p.m in the
[26857.06s -> 26866.65s]  afternoon because when i was in boston i started 7 p.m my time and i was late all the time so it
[26866.65s -> 26879.27s]  really turned out to be like 7 30 7 45 my time pm so i had i had to pull back my time to be able to
[26879.27s -> 26886.94s]  make it so there was no change your time you know what i mean i pulled the stream back about four
[26887.02s -> 26893.93s]  hours just to make it so it didn't start eu time like four o'clock in the morning or something
[26896.86s -> 26903.99s]  but i can't go much earlier than that i really can't i am not at my most energetic until at
[26903.99s -> 26911.72s]  least somewhere in the middle of the afternoon and streaming at like 10 11 12 i'm just not i'm not
[26911.72s -> 26921.50s]  i'm not gonna be able to do it so unfortunately most people in eu are between eight and ten plus
[26921.50s -> 26932.31s]  hours ahead of me there's nothing i can do about it i'm sorry that you're missing streams we live
[26932.31s -> 26951.06s]  in this big world it's 7 a.m here now it's a big world but if whenever you have time to catch it
[26951.06s -> 26962.15s]  then welcome good to see you thank you for the 500 bits uh lucas thanks for the 500 bits
[26962.87s -> 26970.39s]  remember your streams make working through my millions of scholarship applications a lot less
[26970.39s -> 26975.35s]  tedious thanks for everything you do by the way it's pronounced lucas got it right first try
[26976.55s -> 26994.87s]  well hope you get one of those scholarships good luck noon to 3 p.m eastern will be perfect for eu
[26994.87s -> 27002.14s]  and est viewers there's a nine that's nine o'clock in the morning i'm not i'm not gonna be able to
[27002.14s -> 27013.98s]  get up at like eight it's not gonna happen you don't want 8 a.m germa on this stream you don't
[27016.57s -> 27043.85s]  i am certain that e3 every day do it once do you see how groggy and irritable i am during
[27043.85s -> 27061.99s]  those e3 streams we had some community subs come in lord repta five community subs
[27061.99s -> 27072.89s]  prilla d five community subs thanks both of you now if you guys think that i can't reliably turn
[27072.97s -> 27081.54s]  a stream on between you know one to two p.m or like two to three p.m you know how exponentially
[27081.54s -> 27088.26s]  more unreliable i get every hour you go back you are talking about scenarios where i will sleep
[27088.26s -> 27095.18s]  through an entire stream oh hey i'm streaming it tomorrow at 8 a.m between like seven and eight
[27095.18s -> 27103.99s]  a.m pacific i'm gonna wake up at like 11 30 and it's gonna be like oh shit no no no i'm supposed
[27103.99s -> 27109.03s]  to stream and i'm gonna fucking rip out of bed and throw water in my face i'm gonna no that's
[27109.03s -> 27128.74s]  not happening i'm gonna sleep through every alarm i think this the sweet spot for me somewhere
[27128.74s -> 27138.02s]  between 1 30 p.m and like 3 30 p.m between like one and four is where almost every single stream
[27138.02s -> 27142.02s]  is going to start depending on the day and who i'm playing with and what i'm doing do i have
[27142.02s -> 27161.30s]  anything to do during the day or at night that's the sweet spot for me stream at 1 a.m
[27163.88s -> 27172.01s]  i it's weird no my my i'm no i can't because then i'll that's just i'll fuck up my sleep schedule
[27172.01s -> 27180.33s]  forever if i turn a stream on at like 11 to 12 p.m like 11 to 12 a.m like 11 p.m to 12 or 1 a.m
[27180.33s -> 27188.81s]  right i'm gonna be going to bed at like seven o'clock in the morning and then i'm just toast
[27189.61s -> 27196.89s]  you just reversed forever i've been on that schedule before and i hated it i did not like
[27196.89s -> 27206.76s]  it at all it kind of fucks with you you start to feel just strange after three or four weeks of
[27206.76s -> 27213.08s]  being on a schedule where you're going to sleep when the sun comes up and waking up when the sun
[27213.08s -> 27219.34s]  goes down it's just oh i have to do it for like i did it for like four or five months just total
[27220.06s -> 27223.26s]  maybe like three months in a row and it was just like holy shit i feel
[27224.14s -> 27238.22s]  just odd if you are able to do a true night shift then seriously more power to you because
[27238.78s -> 27250.18s]  i could never do it it's nice for a little it is nice for a little while because the world kind
[27250.18s -> 27257.06s]  of turns off and i hear something inherently nice and relaxing and almost it's like your own person
[27257.06s -> 27263.38s]  a little world because there's nothing is not there's no cars really going around
[27264.52s -> 27269.08s]  there's nobody calling you there's you don't have like an errand to do at 3 30 in the morning
[27269.88s -> 27278.68s]  four in the morning you get to live in your own personal little world but once that overstays
[27279.56s -> 27299.74s]  you can get bad for some people they love it and i hope you do but anyway a cream corn
[27300.70s -> 27305.99s]  thanks for the 250 250 bits from a longtime viewer here never knew that you'd love this
[27305.99s -> 27323.78s]  game so dearly do you think you've played it more than tf2 i don't know probably not because
[27327.22s -> 27333.70s]  i had time constraints when i used to play this at at its peak about three to four hours a night
[27334.42s -> 27340.10s]  i played it every day for years i played d2 every single day probably two or three years straight
[27341.90s -> 27349.27s]  but i was under time constraints because i was still in high school so i couldn't stay up i
[27349.27s -> 27356.70s]  could only really play for a few hours a night team fortress 2 was when i was in college and
[27356.70s -> 27366.46s]  then after college when i had every single day besides going to classes so instead of three to
[27366.54s -> 27384.02s]  four hours a day i could play tf2 for like eight to ten so he didn't study a six hour session
[27384.02s -> 27391.00s]  in tf2 was like ah that was that was awesome so just based on that alone that i don't didn't
[27391.00s -> 27397.35s]  have as many time constraints as i did when i was a teenager i would say yes tf2 probably at least
[27397.35s -> 27408.60s]  30 more uh doug mendio thanks again for 500 bits what would be your advice for motivation for a
[27408.60s -> 27413.46s]  project i have albums worth of music and my girlfriend really wants to see me finish the
[27413.46s -> 27423.77s]  record but sometimes i feel a bit scared to finish it just do it finish it because you don't know
[27423.77s -> 27429.86s]  what the end product is until it's done and i know we're getting the foreheads here right just do it
[27429.86s -> 27443.34s]  forehead but you have to take shots there's no such thing as a hypothetical shot you have to take it
[27443.34s -> 27454.57s]  you have to there's no hypothetical shot that's the way in gretzky quote it's true you miss

[28354.90s -> 28360.02s]  i'm a huge night owl and a few summers ago i got completely nocturnal i went to bed at 6 a.m and
[28360.02s -> 28365.22s]  woke up at 5 p.m every day it's honestly really fun at first but after a while you just start to
[28365.22s -> 28377.30s]  feel like garbage yeah it happens and then it takes you so long to fix because even if you stay up
[28377.30s -> 28381.94s]  i'm gonna stay up all day and all night and then i'm gonna fix it and i'm gonna bet it doesn't work
[28382.66s -> 28387.22s]  you end up sleeping the same amount of time in different random time you'll wake up after four
[28387.22s -> 28405.48s]  hours stay up and then sleep for six hours it sucks how do you fix it you want to know the
[28405.48s -> 28410.36s]  real way to fix your sleep schedule and i mean this this is no bullshit this is true this is
[28410.36s -> 28424.92s]  actually real it's with food you have to eat at normal times if you do not wait till you are
[28424.92s -> 28431.96s]  hungry to eat at four or five o'clock in the morning your body will start to regulate itself
[28431.96s -> 28444.20s]  around your clock of eating food so if you just try to keep your meals out of like the wild zone
[28447.77s -> 28459.51s]  it actually can help am i serious no i i'm serious you look it up it actually like eating
[28459.51s -> 28465.40s]  at like normal times like keeps you regular no this ain't fake no it's not i promise
[28475.70s -> 28484.17s]  yeah how to fix your sleep schedule a late dinner can delay sleep so eat your last meal two to three
[28484.17s -> 28489.69s]  hours before you go to bed this will give your body enough time to digest the meal eating dinner
[28489.69s -> 28496.09s]  around the same time each day will also get your body used to into a routine yeah you want to try
[28496.09s -> 28502.41s]  to eat at the same time and eat but you want to eat early no it's real you can help reset your
[28502.41s -> 28512.38s]  body clock by doing it with food yeah i know it's real it helps i remember i did it and it actually
[28512.38s -> 28522.58s]  does help a little bit but uh peaceful hailey finally thank you at the end for a 250 here's
