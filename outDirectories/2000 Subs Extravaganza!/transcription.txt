[3.38s -> 16.97s]  What's happening guys? Jerma here for the 2,000 subscriber extraordinaire. Thank
[16.97s -> 20.77s]  you all so, so much for subscribing to the channel. I can't even... it's been two
[20.77s -> 25.25s]  months. It's been two months and already there's 2,000 people. That's a thousand
[25.25s -> 28.65s]  people a month. That's insane. You understand how insane that is? Look at
[28.65s -> 35.05s]  this cake. 2,000 subscriber cake. Thank you all so much everybody. You are all
[35.05s -> 38.73s]  awesome. I love every single one of you for real. I dressed up as the Scout just
[38.73s -> 41.79s]  for you guys because I know you guys like that shit so. Got a couple of cakes
[41.79s -> 50.78s]  here. Got one cake here, one cake... You want to cut that out? We're trying to film a segment over here.
[50.78s -> 98.54s]  Hey, Dorian. What's your name? What do you say we take care of that engineer right now? Boy! You thought
[98.54s -> 101.66s]  that was it? You thought we were done with this fool? He's still... I got him
[101.66s -> 115.46s]  from a long range. He's still dazed. He's lagging out right now guys. He's lagging
[115.46s -> 119.83s]  out. I only got like another 30 seconds until his connection comes back.
[121.42s -> 129.87s]  Get out of there! Oh my god, this is like sludge.
[134.43s -> 142.10s]  Alright, this is barbecue sauce. Get me a barbecue. I have sweet and sour in the McDonald's bag.
[142.10s -> 148.10s]  I can't do it. Somebody else has to do it. Alright, never mind. That's good enough.
[148.10s -> 153.10s]  Thank you all so much again. I really appreciate it. And as this channel grows, I hope to see more of you people.
[153.10s -> 157.10s]  Hope to see more people come in. It's gonna be a lot of fun. So, thank you all again.
[157.10s -> 159.00s]  Take care. I'll see you all next time.
