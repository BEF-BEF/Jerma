[1.91s -> 7.27s]  Oh, where does he live again? God damn it. I just never remember where he lives.
[7.27s -> 12.63s]  I think it's this one up here. Gotta pick up my colleague. There he is.
[12.63s -> 14.07s]  Hey, Pinkerton!
[14.07s -> 14.95s]  Come on, get in!
[14.95s -> 19.06s]  I'm getting in, I'm getting in. You gotta pull up to the sidewalk.
[19.06s -> 22.82s]  Listen, Moby, Moby, we're gonna be late to work. If you just shut up for a minute,
[22.82s -> 24.98s]  I gotta talk to you about something really important.
[24.98s -> 28.89s]  All right, what is it about those reports again? I told you I had the reports in.
[28.89s -> 31.05s]  Is it this right? Is it straight or right?
[31.05s -> 32.09s]  It's no, you go straight.
[32.09s -> 38.09s]  Okay, straight. You live in such a weird area, I just never know where to actually go. Straight still?
[38.09s -> 38.89s]  Yes, keep going straight.
[38.89s -> 40.01s]  Am I going straight?
[40.01s -> 41.93s]  Yes, you're going straight.
[41.93s -> 55.40s]  I swear we've hit every single red light in Liberty City.
[58.02s -> 60.98s]  Just go. No one will notice. There's no cops around. Just go.
[60.98s -> 62.50s]  Do you really think we can get out of here?
[62.50s -> 66.90s]  Just make a quick right. Just go. Burn out. You don't buy a car. It's expensive.
[66.90s -> 68.90s]  And then you sassy Susan this stuff.
[68.90s -> 72.42s]  Okay, I got through the red light. What is with you and sassy Susan, by the way?
[72.42s -> 90.04s]  I don't know. Get out the car. I have a knife.
[100.95s -> 102.31s]  Look at my face close up.
[106.31s -> 108.23s]  Get like a rifle and zoom onto this face.
[121.46s -> 123.30s]  What are you doing?
[136.79s -> 150.97s]  My face hurts.
[157.78s -> 170.87s]  How do you do that? How do you do that? Everything about this is so broken.
[174.55s -> 179.19s]  Can you believe that there's a road swamp? It's unbelievable. I've got water all over me.
[179.19s -> 182.55s]  I haven't seen a road swamp this bad since Brazil.
[182.55s -> 185.43s]  I haven't seen a road swamp that bad in a long time, but anyways.
[186.15s -> 193.38s]  Yeah, hello, Geico. Yes, I need one of those automatic repairs of my car.
[194.02s -> 196.50s]  Yeah, you're honestly using Geico.
[197.46s -> 202.26s]  I'm on the phone. Be quiet. I need to get one of those automatic repairs.
[202.26s -> 205.62s]  I'm a million dollar businessman. I do. Thank you.
[206.58s -> 217.11s]  Yes. Yes. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay. Yes. Sure. Yes.
[217.75s -> 221.59s]  I don't know. I'm not sure. Yes. I'm pretty positive, but it's not. Yes.
[222.23s -> 227.78s]  To be honest with you, I think it could be. Yes. Maybe a different thing. Maybe something else.
[227.78s -> 236.28s]  Yes. Yeah, I guess you could be right. Yes. Could you be wrong? Yes. No. Yes.
[240.22s -> 242.22s]  Nick, stop running so fast.
[243.82s -> 247.61s]  My legs. Look at this cute little hippo.
[247.61s -> 250.50s]  Where's the hippo? I don't even see a hippo.
[250.50s -> 251.30s]  To the right.
[251.54s -> 259.24s]  What? Oh my goodness. This little hippo is so beautiful. I wish I had one just like it.
[259.24s -> 263.54s]  All right. Come on. Don't throw the fingers at me like that. Like you do that sometimes.
[266.42s -> 268.42s]  All right. We need to cross the street. Be careful.
[269.54s -> 274.34s]  Be careful. There could be a car coming. Look both ways. Left and right. Good job.
[274.34s -> 280.15s]  Hold on. It's completely. It was never even
[280.15s -> 282.63s]  opened and never used and it's already ruined.
[286.09s -> 295.42s]  This guy's like clone just came over here. Can I make these two fat guys fight each other?
[295.42s -> 302.82s]  Oh my God. I think I can. Come on. Hey, you fat guy. Fight this fat guy.
[302.82s -> 311.62s]  Oh no. I have like the fat shit Mario brothers like attacking me. Here we go. Come on. Punch
[311.62s -> 318.97s]  him. There it is. Okay. Here we go. Place your bets, everybody. All right. I got the fat guy in
[318.97s -> 326.09s]  the blue jacket. Oh, salty bets.com. Come on. Do you actually know what that is? Come on,
[326.09s -> 331.85s]  dude. Will you please? I got a lot of money on you. Wow. You are terrible. There you go.
[331.85s -> 339.54s]  Give him a left hook. Place your bets. Wow. You suck, dude. Stop like throwing the long
[339.54s -> 348.82s]  haymaker. That's like your downfall. No, I lost. Every day we do the same trip to work and you
[348.82s -> 354.10s]  always tell me I'm the fun guy. I'm the fun guy. It's not about being the fun guy. It's about being
[354.10s -> 358.18s]  the hard worker like me that gets a job done. I mean, I can't believe this. That you would be
[358.82s -> 363.62s]  stupid about everything. And you know, every time you're in the office, you always get too much
[363.62s -> 367.38s]  water. You take too many breaks. You're going to make my blood pressure go through the roof.
[367.38s -> 370.82s]  What do you think about that? Well, you know, as a salesman, it's not entirely about getting work
[370.82s -> 374.34s]  done. It's the people interaction, the people you're selling. You got to be the fun guy.
[374.34s -> 385.94s]  Uh, no, nothing about this should be, should be a thing. No, this is, I'm just going to move on.
[387.48s -> 395.80s]  Make the right turn. No, I know a better way to go. We have to go right anyway, eventually.
[395.80s -> 400.92s]  No, listen, I know where I'm going. I've worked in this building for more than 30 years. What are
[400.92s -> 408.20s]  you a second year? Yeah, but I've been earning more than you weekly, monthly and yearly. This
[408.20s -> 417.08s]  right, you go down the street and then it's going to be on our left. We're going to get a ticket.
[417.08s -> 422.44s]  I don't care. I'm so sorry. It's a green light. No, it's yellow. It's yellow and that turns red,
[422.44s -> 427.32s]  which means you cannot go any further. We had a chance to go. You want me to go? Yeah, go.
[427.32s -> 431.00s]  You want me to go through this red light? No, no, no, no, no. You want me to go?
[431.00s -> 434.44s]  Is that what you wanted? Is this what you wanted? You wanted me to go?
[436.01s -> 440.01s]  Okay, we're at work. Okay, we're at work. Thank you. Yeah, that was a good trip.
