[0.31s -> 29.64s]  What? What? What on earth just happened? I just got fucking headshot through the gate.
[29.64s -> 40.26s]  No, seriously, what? That's impossible. Not anymore. You sound like terrified. I am. Because
[40.26s -> 45.06s]  that was legitimate. You're not upset. You sound scared. It's not as safe as we once
[45.06s -> 63.53s]  thought. Go to like the top left area. Yeah. By that exit. There's a tiny slit on the wall
[64.25s -> 70.66s]  right in front of the, before the gate. So like to the right of the gate. Yeah. It's like on the
[70.66s -> 85.61s]  wall. It's not parallel with the gate. Oh, I see it. I see it. So I have to be like here. Oh my god.
[85.61s -> 90.01s]  Dude, how the hell, this is like so difficult to like do this. You pretty much have to wait for
[90.01s -> 95.53s]  someone to walk in like two precise spots. Yeah. Like on top of a rock out there and just maybe in
[95.53s -> 109.19s]  the hill in front of it. Yeah. Oh, this is the guy. This is the guy. Oh, oh my god. Oh my god,
[109.19s -> 113.91s]  I got him. Dude, what people don't realize. This is what people don't realize. When you're watching
[113.91s -> 119.03s]  this video right now, this is like this video was taken like a week apart from the last one. Like
[119.03s -> 125.51s]  this is unbelievable that I got that guy revenge on that guy like a week or two later. I can't,
[128.23s -> 137.83s]  I can't believe the same guy is here. Was it incentive phase? Yes. The exact same scenario
[137.83s -> 139.83s]  except reverse it. I got him.
