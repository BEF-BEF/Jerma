[0.31s -> 13.16s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[13.16s -> 16.16s]  And what is going on on the screen right now?
[16.16s -> 22.34s]  This is Randomizer. If you don't know what Randomizer is, this is a crazy mod for Team Fortress 2.
[22.34s -> 28.34s]  And what it does is it makes you spawn with a random class and a random loadout.
[28.34s -> 33.34s]  And I don't mean a random loadout like as in you spawn as the heavy and you get a random heavy loadout.
[33.34s -> 38.34s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. You spawn as the heavy with a flamethrower and like the Jarate.
[38.34s -> 44.34s]  It's crazy. I suggest you try and find a server. Sometimes it's hard to find a Randomizer server.
[44.34s -> 49.34s]  But if you can get in one, my god, this is like the funniest goddamn thing I've ever done in this game.
[49.34s -> 53.77s]  And the reason why it's so funny is because everything just gets so broken.
[53.77s -> 57.77s]  You'll see coming up later, I play as the soldier with a Tomislav.
[57.77s -> 62.77s]  And whenever you shoot the thing, your Tomislav goes up and down a hundred miles per hour.
[62.77s -> 66.77s]  It is insane. It almost made me want to, I had, I got a headache.
[66.77s -> 69.77s]  I had to stop doing it. I was like, okay, I want to die with this class.
[69.77s -> 73.94s]  Screw this. And really this last, I'd say last three or four days,
[73.94s -> 77.94s]  I've just been going into Team Fortress and playing these crazy mods.
[77.94s -> 81.94s]  One of the mods, one of the favorite ones, my goodness, Balloon Race.
[81.94s -> 85.94s]  I've only found one or two servers that actually play Balloon Race.
[85.94s -> 89.94s]  And I want to play them all day now. I got to get some more guys into there.
[89.94s -> 93.94s]  Got to get more awareness to Balloon Race because it is so much fun.
[93.94s -> 95.94s]  And also all crit servers, I've been doing that too.
[95.94s -> 98.94s]  So I've been being a real weirdo on Team Fortress lately.
[98.94s -> 101.94s]  Expect some videos on some of these crazy mods.
[101.94s -> 104.94s]  I'll probably do a Saxton Hale mod, probably do Prop Hunt.
[104.94s -> 106.94s]  So expect those at some point in the future.
[106.94s -> 108.94s]  It's just something I've been having a lot of fun doing.
[108.94s -> 112.70s]  So now I want to go on a different track.
[112.70s -> 115.70s]  And I want to talk about a certain bet that I made with you guys.
[115.70s -> 119.70s]  Probably a week or two ago when I did the face cam video.
[119.70s -> 122.70s]  All I've been seeing is comments telling me I got to eat the egg.
[122.70s -> 125.70s]  Where's the egg? I got to eat that damn egg.
[125.70s -> 130.00s]  So if you missed the video or to refresh your memory, this is what I said.
[149.39s -> 154.95s]  So judging by what happened in the video, I have to eat an egg.
[154.95s -> 157.95s]  And I did say in that video, I did say to eat a raw egg.
[157.95s -> 159.95s]  I was going to eat a raw egg.
[159.95s -> 162.95s]  But guys, you can't eat raw eggs.
[162.95s -> 165.95s]  If you eat a raw egg, I mean, it's not terrible.
[165.95s -> 168.95s]  But there's a chance you can contract Salmonella.
[168.95s -> 172.95s]  And I don't want to have that looming over my head when I eat it.
[172.95s -> 174.95s]  So this is what I'm proposing to you guys.
[174.95s -> 179.95s]  This is what I'm going to do this weekend, this Saturday during my live stream.
[179.95s -> 181.95s]  It's going to be the egg stream.
[181.95s -> 183.95s]  And what do I mean by egg stream?
[183.95s -> 188.13s]  I'm going to cook up 12 or 24 hard-boiled eggs.
[188.13s -> 193.56s]  And every time I'm going to play Team Fortress 2, every single time I die,
[193.56s -> 198.56s]  I'm going to eat one of the hard-boiled eggs until they're all gone.
[198.56s -> 201.56s]  So if I'm having a really bad night on TF2,
[201.56s -> 203.56s]  I'm going to eat a dozen eggs or even more than that.
[203.56s -> 206.56s]  Maybe two dozen eggs if I'm doing really bad.
[206.56s -> 208.86s]  So I suggest you try and show up to that.
[208.86s -> 210.86s]  It's going to be pretty entertaining for you.
[210.86s -> 212.86s]  Awful for me potentially.
[212.86s -> 215.86s]  I like eggs. I mean, don't get me wrong. I like eggs.
[215.86s -> 217.86s]  I just don't like eating 50 eggs.
[217.86s -> 219.86s]  You know, it's going to be interesting.
[219.86s -> 224.42s]  So now that that is out of the way, I'll talk about Randomizer for a little bit
[224.42s -> 225.42s]  and what's going on right now.
[225.42s -> 228.42s]  I happened to bonk that heavy, but he ended up getting the kill on me.
[228.42s -> 231.42s]  Actually, somebody shot me with... I don't even know what the hell...
[231.42s -> 233.42s]  What gun is that? I've never seen that before.
[233.42s -> 237.42s]  Well, anyways, this is the part what I was talking about before with the...
[237.42s -> 243.82s]  I feel like I'm in a blender when I watch this. Oh my God.
[243.82s -> 248.82s]  This is exactly what I was talking about when I said things just become broken.
[248.82s -> 251.82s]  As you can see, that's not normal. That is not normal.
[251.82s -> 256.82s]  You are absolutely not supposed to get electrocuted when you shoot the Tommy Slop.
[256.82s -> 260.21s]  That's not supposed to happen.
[260.21s -> 262.21s]  And I found from playing this for a little bit,
[262.21s -> 267.21s]  the best thing you could possibly get is probably the scout with the minigun.
[267.21s -> 271.21s]  Or second best would probably be heavy with the medigun.
[271.21s -> 275.21s]  So you can be a healer with 300 health. It's just mind-boggling.
[275.21s -> 280.64s]  And the worst loadout you can get is anything to do with a soldier banner.
[280.64s -> 281.64s]  Because I don't think they even work.
[281.64s -> 285.64s]  I tried to blow the horn. I had the buff banner at one point when I was playing earlier.
[285.64s -> 289.64s]  And I got like 9 million damage and it didn't even matter.
[289.64s -> 292.64s]  I tried to blow the horn. Nothing happened. It just kind of was broken in my hand.
[292.64s -> 295.82s]  And I'm pretty sure there's a lot of other stuff that's broken as well.
[295.82s -> 299.82s]  I can't really think on the top of my head right now, but I'm pretty sure engineer buildings.
[299.82s -> 301.82s]  I don't think you can do them as other classes.
[301.82s -> 305.82s]  Or the spy disguises or the spy watches.
[305.82s -> 307.06s]  I'm pretty sure they don't work.
[307.06s -> 309.06s]  And how funny would that be though?
[309.06s -> 315.06s]  How hysterical would that be if you could see a heavy kind of crouching in the corner with the disguise mask on his face?
[315.06s -> 317.06s]  Just sitting there with like the cloak and dagger or something.
[317.06s -> 319.49s]  Now that would be so awesome.
[319.49s -> 321.49s]  But this is going to be the end of the gameplay guys.
[321.49s -> 324.49s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[324.49s -> 327.49s]  And come to that livestream this weekend.
[327.49s -> 330.49s]  6 p.m. Eastern time if you don't know, if you've never been there before.
[330.49s -> 335.49s]  If you are a long time stream goer, should be a great time, should be crazy.
[335.49s -> 338.49s]  I wonder how many eggs I'm going to be able to eat.
[338.49s -> 340.98s]  That's the real question.
[340.98s -> 342.98s]  Question of the video. Here it goes. Ready?
[342.98s -> 343.98s]  Here's the question.
[343.98s -> 348.22s]  How many eggs do you think I'm going to eat in that livestream?
[348.22s -> 351.22s]  So I look forward to your responses and I'll see you guys all soon.
[351.22s -> 353.22s]  Take care everybody.
