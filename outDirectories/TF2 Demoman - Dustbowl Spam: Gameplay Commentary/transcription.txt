[3.45s -> 13.67s]  What is going on, everybody? Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[13.67s -> 19.67s]  This time we are the Demoman, the default stock Demoman. There's no unlockables here, folks.
[19.67s -> 26.67s]  Only the default vanilla 2007 Team Fortress 2 setup, sticky bomb launcher, grenade launcher, and the bottle.
[26.67s -> 32.67s]  I kind of just felt like doing a gameplay where I just did the default stock, because a lot of you guys don't really have any of the new items.
[33.17s -> 37.17s]  And I figured why not just do a complete stock gameplay, playing on Dust Bowl.
[37.17s -> 40.67s]  And I gotta tell you guys, this is a very, very, very good gameplay.
[40.67s -> 48.47s]  I think I only died two times and I killed like 700 people. That's a lie, but you get the idea. I do very well.
[48.47s -> 53.60s]  So here are some Demoman tips, especially on this part of Dust Bowl, the first part of Dust Bowl.
[53.60s -> 56.60s]  You want to stick around up top on this little building up here.
[56.60s -> 61.60s]  Heavy Medic comes around the corner, but I get lucky crit right there and I just barely get the kill.
[61.60s -> 68.10s]  This little house is fantastic, because look at underneath inside. There is two full health packs and ammo.
[68.10s -> 72.10s]  You do not even need a Medic to hang out with you up here. You don't need a Dispenser, nothing.
[72.10s -> 78.60s]  If you get hit, just drop down the little middle there and get yourself some more health and ammo. It's a fantastic place to stay.
[78.60s -> 84.10s]  I would say same thing for Soldier too. If you're Soldier or Demoman, I would suggest sitting in this spot right here.
[84.10s -> 89.46s]  Prime example right here. Take a look, I get lit on fire, but it's as if it didn't even happen at all.
[89.46s -> 96.46s]  Full health, full ammo. Let's keep going. Sir, spam a lot now. Accidentally kill a disguised Cloak Spy.
[96.46s -> 100.46s]  I hate when that happens, but you know how this game is. You give and you take, right?
[100.46s -> 103.46s]  Anyways, here's a good tip for you guys with the Sticky Launcher. Watch what happens.
[103.46s -> 110.46s]  My Medic gets lit on fire and you have to place your Sticky Bombs five to ten feet in front of somebody when they're running after you.
[110.46s -> 113.46s]  Otherwise, they're just not going to get hit by any of the blast radius.
[113.46s -> 119.46s]  This is especially important for Pyros because as a Demoman, you don't really have any close-range combat abilities.
[119.46s -> 125.46s]  Except for, of course, your melee weapon, but who wants to bring out a melee weapon for a Pyro? That's pretty much a death sentence.
[125.46s -> 130.64s]  Get Ubered by the Quick Fix and as you saw, took out pretty much the entire left-hand side right there.
[130.64s -> 135.64s]  Big deal because if they had gotten up there, they probably would have gotten on the point and capped it.
[135.64s -> 138.64s]  I'm glad I could get over there. Good Quick Fix Uber by that Medic.
[138.64s -> 144.64s]  And now I'm back up on my Dragon Perch, just shooting and spamming into their spawn area.
[144.64s -> 147.64s]  A nice little pop-up right here on this Demoman. I get the kill.
[147.64s -> 150.64s]  Back on my house, hanging out in my little shack over here.
[150.64s -> 154.64s]  Got to move away from it now though because it looks like they're coming out the right-hand side.
[154.64s -> 160.94s]  And I get sniped by Sitting Duck, who gets me with a nice body shot coming around the side there.
[160.94s -> 165.25s]  That's pretty much what you want to do, especially on this map on Dust Bowl.
[166.25s -> 170.25s]  Demoman at this point is an incredibly powerful class.
[170.25s -> 174.25s]  Spy I saw out of the corner of my eye and there he is. Boom, he gets blown up.
[174.25s -> 179.25s]  Now kind of on the right side over here, trying to do some work, just putting pills out everywhere.
[179.25s -> 184.25s]  Century Gun now is going up on the point and look at where I end up.
[184.25s -> 189.25s]  Take a look at where I am right now. Back on the Perch with this Soldier.
[189.25s -> 194.25s]  This is incredibly dominating now because if you have more than one Power Class up here
[194.25s -> 197.25s]  shooting into the spawn area, it's very difficult for anyone to get out.
[197.25s -> 201.25s]  And even an Ubert Heavy is going to have trouble killing anyone
[201.25s -> 205.25s]  because we can just jump backwards behind the house and kind of ring around the Rosie with him.
[205.25s -> 208.25s]  So I kind of get embarrassed right here, guys.
[208.25s -> 212.25s]  I jump down here, see this sniper, try and kill him, and then a Demo Knight comes over here.
[212.25s -> 216.25s]  And rather than just pulling out my bottle and going toe-to-toe,
[216.25s -> 220.25s]  I didn't really have enough brain power to do that, so I just get murdered by him.
[220.25s -> 223.49s]  That's the only other time I die. I think I actually...
[223.49s -> 228.49s]  I'll take that back because you'll see, this is a pretty crazy gameplay, how this ends.
[228.49s -> 233.49s]  It's one of the most ridiculous things ever, so I'm not going to spoil it for you what happens,
[233.49s -> 236.49s]  but you'll see, it's pretty insane what happens at the end of this gameplay.
[236.49s -> 240.92s]  And let me take this time just briefly to talk about my livestream
[240.92s -> 243.92s]  and how thankful I am for all the people that showed up to it.
[243.92s -> 249.92s]  It was a success, an absolute success. I think I peaked out around 150 viewers at one time
[249.92s -> 253.92s]  for maybe 45 minutes there was 150 people watching or something like that.
[253.92s -> 258.92s]  Really, really cool, really awesome. I'm really sorry that I couldn't get Deus Ex to work,
[258.92s -> 263.92s]  but apparently you have to go through like a dog and pony show to get the thing to load into windowed mode,
[263.92s -> 268.10s]  and obviously I can't do it in full screen mode because you can't really stream anything in full screen,
[268.10s -> 275.34s]  but my plan, guys, is for every Monday and Friday, or maybe every Tuesday and Friday,
[275.34s -> 277.34s]  is to do a livestream twice a week.
[277.34s -> 280.34s]  Hopefully I see a lot of you guys there, a lot of new people.
[280.34s -> 284.34s]  I'll put it in the description, the link to my Twitch account, so hopefully you guys show up.
[284.34s -> 287.34s]  It should be a great time. Probably going to do one tonight too.
[287.34s -> 290.34s]  Tuesday and Friday probably is when I'm going to do it.
[290.34s -> 294.34s]  So let's get back into the gameplay now. No more talking about my dumb livestream.
[294.34s -> 301.77s]  So as you can probably tell, it's becoming painfully obvious that this team can't even get out of the spawn doors.
[301.77s -> 304.77s]  They're getting up here instantly dying. They can't even get close.
[304.77s -> 307.77s]  They can't even get remotely close to the point.
[307.77s -> 312.77s]  So I'm just kind of hanging back here thinking to myself, should I do something about this?
[312.77s -> 315.77s]  Should I switch teams or something and make something happen?
[315.77s -> 319.77s]  And you'll see my conscience really takes hold of me after about another minute or so.
[319.77s -> 324.77s]  You'll see what happens. And ultimately you'll see how this ends.
[324.77s -> 329.01s]  So anyways, shooting more spam, getting more random kills, going to fill my ammo up.
[329.01s -> 333.01s]  I get Ubered right here in about two or three seconds. I think it's right here.
[333.01s -> 338.01s]  Yep, I get Ubered. We come down to the spawn, start spawn camping, just being real jerks.
[338.01s -> 343.01s]  I hate when people do this and every time I find myself doing this I always go,
[343.01s -> 347.18s]  Okay, let's turn around. I don't want to do this anymore. This is not fun.
[347.18s -> 350.42s]  Because it's dumb. It really is dumb doing this.
[350.42s -> 357.97s]  So you'll see after about another five or ten seconds we get back down into their spawn area and I just kill myself.
[357.97s -> 362.46s]  I just go right in front of their spawn door. I drop three stickies.
[362.46s -> 365.46s]  I kill myself and then I switch teams.
[365.46s -> 369.70s]  And after the team switch you'll see what happens. It's insane.
[369.70s -> 373.70s]  I can't even begin to describe how insane this is after I kill myself.
[373.70s -> 378.01s]  So let's just turn around here, spam a few more times, maybe get one more kill.
[378.01s -> 381.01s]  I think I get one more kill here. Yep, it's one. Here it is.
[381.01s -> 386.01s]  One last kill. Here we go. Going back down to their spawn there's a heavy and a sniper.
[386.01s -> 389.01s]  I get the kill on the heavy and then here we go.
[389.01s -> 391.01s]  Boom, see you later heavy.
[391.01s -> 394.18s]  Okay, time to kill the spawn, right?
[394.18s -> 399.18s]  Let's load this door up with stickies and then walk into it and kill myself.
[399.18s -> 404.90s]  So now I'm on blue team. I just switched to blue team.
[404.90s -> 408.25s]  Take a look at the time. Three minutes and 47 seconds.
[408.25s -> 411.25s]  Come out here just spamming like crazy. Get a couple kills.
[411.25s -> 417.25s]  I want to make something happen. It was a goal of mine, guys, to be able to win this game now.
[417.25s -> 419.55s]  Medic Pyro coming up towards the spawn.
[420.55s -> 425.55s]  Get the kill on me, but my teammates are so fed up at this point, I believe,
[425.55s -> 428.55s]  that they just started to push really, really hard.
[428.55s -> 432.55s]  This Medic-Soldier pair really do a lot of work and they really help the team out a lot.
[432.55s -> 435.79s]  Too much suppression, too much domination.
[435.79s -> 438.79s]  Kill the Sentry and the Engineer making it and now we're...
[438.79s -> 442.79s]  Look at the movement. Look at how fast everyone is just jumping up here to get on the point.
[442.79s -> 445.79s]  Now this wasn't all me, guys.
[445.79s -> 449.79s]  It's kind of coincidental that I switched and now all of a sudden we're winning,
[449.79s -> 452.79s]  but really I think this team was just getting sick of being in the spawn
[452.79s -> 455.03s]  and they really started to make a push.
[455.03s -> 457.03s]  Now look at the time. I want you to take a look at the time.
[457.03s -> 459.03s]  Seven minutes and 28 seconds.
[459.03s -> 463.03s]  Let's count down to see when the game ends, okay?
[463.03s -> 466.03s]  Watch this. Get out here. There's nobody really here, by the way.
[466.03s -> 470.21s]  There's one Soldier who kind of gets dominated by that group that was right there.
[470.21s -> 474.21s]  Engineer is trying to build a Sentry on the point and I think I distracted him enough
[474.21s -> 478.21s]  that he decided I was going to be his top priority and not build up a Sentry
[478.21s -> 481.21s]  and it ends up being the downfall of the team.
[481.21s -> 484.21s]  Take a look now. Everybody is starting to get on the point.
[484.21s -> 489.21s]  We're going to cap it now. We win the game in less than two minutes
[489.21s -> 492.21s]  after switching to the blue team. We won.
[492.21s -> 495.21s]  Unbelievable. I can't believe it. I was speechless when it happened.
[495.21s -> 499.45s]  I said, holy crap. Talk about a gameplay that's a keeper right there.
[499.45s -> 502.45s]  Anyways, thank you all so much for watching. I really appreciate it.
[502.45s -> 507.45s]  Show up at my livestream Fridays and Tuesdays probably around 7 to 8 o'clock Eastern Standard Time
[507.45s -> 509.62s]  is when I'm going to do them.
[509.62s -> 511.62s]  Take care, everybody. I'll see you all soon.
