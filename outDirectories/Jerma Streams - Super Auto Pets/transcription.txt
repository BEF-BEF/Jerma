[3.51s -> 9.64s]  Hey, sorry everybody. My cat rolled all over my Twitch computer.
[10.84s -> 15.93s]  And my cat, I have a piano that's over here that's hooked up to the screen,
[15.93s -> 21.32s]  and my computer cat walked over the piano. I didn't mean to turn the stream on.
[23.38s -> 34.68s]  Good morning, how are you? So yeah, it's early. I'm, I was up late last night,
[36.46s -> 41.58s]  uh, preparing for this exact moment. Um, I know a lot of you probably really
[42.54s -> 47.56s]  confused as to why there's a stream right now. Uh, I'm participating in Ludwig's
[48.52s -> 56.23s]  Super Auto Pets Tournament. That's right. In a game that I have a collective
[58.89s -> 64.42s]  hour and 12 minutes in the game. I'm gonna get fucking annihilated.
[65.38s -> 80.86s]  I was cramming for an exam. Yeah, I was up late last night because it's like,
[80.86s -> 84.38s]  oh man, that game looks really cute and really fun. It's what a cool looking game.
[85.10s -> 92.38s]  I saw Ludwig play it and I saw other people playing it too. Uh, and then late last night,
[92.38s -> 99.46s]  I found myself saying, you know what? Yeah, I think it's time to cram for that exam that I
[99.46s -> 106.63s]  told Ludwig I would be in like a week ago. So I watched the Northern Lion Tier List.
[107.67s -> 118.66s]  You know, just trying to get an idea. I played for a little while. I actually,
[118.66s -> 123.30s]  this is not a joke. I'm making the, this is not me making something up. This is for real.
[123.94s -> 131.46s]  I fell asleep last night with Northern Lion telling me how good and bad things were
[132.34s -> 142.46s]  the different animals while I was sleeping with the iPad on my chest. I was just sitting there
[142.46s -> 148.22s]  with iPad on chest listening to him. My eyes are closed and I open it up. I think the videos,
[148.22s -> 154.94s]  it's like a two and a half hour video. I started the video. It was just like, fuck, I'm tired.
[154.94s -> 159.74s]  This, I gotta, I gotta know though. I need to know. And I closed my eyes and I kind of woke up.
[160.38s -> 163.98s]  It was, I think like an hour had gone by and he was still going through the list.
[164.86s -> 177.99s]  Well, I think I absorbed some info, but yeah, I'm very prepared to just be the,
[178.71s -> 187.96s]  the first enemy of level one for all the people playing in the tournament today.
[188.68s -> 198.90s]  His voice sounds so sleepy. Well, it's because I woke up 20 minutes ago. I literally rolled out
[198.90s -> 210.50s]  and got out here. I told you I was up all night studying. The reason why I'm live like 20 minutes
[210.50s -> 215.96s]  early is because I want to play around and everyone's, I look, I don't even care how bad
[215.96s -> 219.90s]  it from what he thinks I'm playing. I'm not, I can't even look at the chat because people are
[219.90s -> 226.04s]  going to be like, holy shit dude, you suck. You got, how fucking dumb are you? I think I just
[226.04s -> 238.10s]  barely learned what the, what the alligator did. That was about 15 minutes ago. Let me tweet this.
[238.66s -> 249.50s]  Okay. Yeah, this is, this is, and this stream is only going to be as long as the tournament is.
[249.50s -> 254.97s]  You know, I actually kind of like the voice. I like having this voice. You know, you know,
[255.05s -> 258.33s]  you know how you wonder how does the guy on the radio sound like this?
[259.13s -> 265.13s]  Well, it's because the guy on the radio is, it's about seven or eight AM and they, they have wake
[265.13s -> 276.84s]  up voice and they use wake up voice to their advantage. See by noon, 12 o'clock Eastern,
[276.84s -> 287.54s]  by the way, this is gone. And those guys talk normally for the rest of the day. Sonic is the
[287.54s -> 292.42s]  funniest movie of the year. That's funny. That's like my favorite joke of 20 of 2020
[293.14s -> 300.52s]  and nobody even voted for it. A nice hot voice, Andy.
[305.93s -> 312.49s]  Howard Stern hates me. Howard Stern. No, it's, it's, it's just being really close to a microphone
[312.49s -> 319.03s]  with a deep voice in a compressor. When you get really close to a microphone and you have a
[319.03s -> 324.79s]  compressor on, what it does is it, it takes your voice in it and it just transports it into
[324.79s -> 329.59s]  everybody's minds. It's crazy what radio's done. You know, what's the next question? Uh, Phil.
[335.14s -> 346.49s]  All right. No, I don't, no, I don't want to run a virus scan. I have to warm up. I'm not,
[346.49s -> 348.81s]  I actually don't even know how this is going to work, but we'll figure it out.
[354.60s -> 359.34s]  What is this exactly? All right. Let me show you what this is. It's a game we're going to learn
[359.34s -> 371.90s]  together before the tournament. Why is my chat not even in dark mode? What? Okay. Here we go.
[371.90s -> 384.36s]  I don't know. It's not, it's not back of me. I should, maybe I should. All right. Here we go.
[386.89s -> 394.76s]  So this is super autopets. Yeah. Yes. You can see, you can see my name. My name. I know at this,
[394.76s -> 406.07s]  I'm not going to be able to play on this fucking account ever again, probably. Yeah. My name is
[406.07s -> 416.73s]  Bert Ernie. Bert Ernie. This over here. All right. So this is, it's okay. You don't, uh,
[416.73s -> 422.62s]  you ever play like auto chess? I haven't, but I played battlegrounds. Uh, Hearthstone
[422.62s -> 429.24s]  Battlegrounds is apparently very similar to this. And it is very similar, which if Hearthstone
[429.24s -> 440.58s]  Battlegrounds is just, uh, uh, team fight tactics, whatever it is, that how it works. You get in the
[440.58s -> 447.29s]  game, you started with them. And by the way, I've got, I've got hats on his hats. It's gotta,
[447.29s -> 452.15s]  I gotta just make sure I keep an eye on this discord over here because I don't want to miss
[452.15s -> 458.79s]  the call time. It's very cute. And it's okay. It's just like Hearthstone Battlegrounds, just like
[458.79s -> 466.20s]  probably team fight tactics. I saw, I was, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm like a reviewer. I check out,
[466.20s -> 471.94s]  you know, games that have come out that are new. And by that, I mean, I watched Ludwig play this
[471.94s -> 474.34s]  and then I said, wow, that looks cool. And he said, Hey, do you want to play in a tournament?
[474.34s -> 480.95s]  And I was like, sure. And then I realized that it was today. Okay. Uh, so it's just like,
[480.95s -> 486.28s]  this is the attack. This is the heart of health. What did you study? I told you I fell asleep with
[486.28s -> 511.80s]  Northern lions tier list. I was on my own, my chest. No, I wasn't on my chest. Okay. All right.
[511.80s -> 521.46s]  I'm going to try. I just spilled coffee all over me. I'm not even fucking ready. Oh, all right.
[521.54s -> 530.20s]  All right. Um, no, I'm not. I'm tired. I just woke up. Everybody relax. I'm laughing. I'm very
[530.20s -> 534.44s]  disheveled right now because I just dropped the hot coffee on my chest and I don't have any clothes
[534.44s -> 545.96s]  on. I don't have clothes on. So I just burnt my chest. Okay. So you really want to get like a,
[546.68s -> 552.31s]  the pig sucks from what I hear, but they fight on their own. It's automatically right. So I'm
[552.31s -> 557.11s]  going to let's just go with cricket. Everything costs three gold. That includes the food, which
[557.11s -> 562.63s]  is the sometimes give permanent buffs. Sometimes it gives something temporary. It's sometimes it
[562.63s -> 570.71s]  might give, uh, health and I'm saying mana, but health and attack. So we've got a cricket, uh,
[570.71s -> 576.65s]  and rolling. You can roll is what she gets you other ones to choose from using the pay to lose
[576.65s -> 588.31s]  pack. Why? I didn't know what the rules were. So I just got to get, you got to get stuff up there
[588.31s -> 595.99s]  as, as, I mean, as Northern lion says, forget about being the big brain tech guy and go for wins.
[595.99s -> 599.51s]  Like, you don't, you don't tech into something, right? Like this is what I've been taught
[599.51s -> 607.14s]  by the best, by the way. All right. So let's, uh, beaver's good beavers. All right. It's two, two.
[607.14s -> 611.86s]  Let's get another, uh, well, I've mosquitoes. Pretty good. Mosquito throws a mosquito dust at
[611.86s -> 623.50s]  somebody to start and you'll see how this works. Are you ready? Here we go. Uh, name your team. The
[624.62s -> 631.06s]  fishy lawnmowers. That's fine. No face cam. No way. So then I don't, I don't, I don't know how
[631.06s -> 637.27s]  this works. I don't, I don't understand how the matchmaking works, but there's no time limit
[637.27s -> 643.64s]  like there is in Hearthstone. I killed that guy, got the hit there. That summons another cricket
[643.64s -> 651.19s]  and then there you go. Automatically does it. And there's your first win. There's no audio.
[651.19s -> 664.49s]  Oh, okay. Well, this should be no audio is broken. I got it. I got it. Okay. So you, if you lose,
[664.49s -> 670.86s]  you lose a heart and after turn three, if you lose, you lose three hearts. And I know what
[670.86s -> 675.02s]  you're thinking. I know what you look over time, over the course of like a few days, you get,
[675.10s -> 684.09s]  you get these back. Um, you can all, I'm just kidding. So the cool part about this is the reason
[684.09s -> 690.49s]  why I think it's cool. I like it. No, that's, it's just, that was a lie. Don't believe that.
[690.49s -> 696.42s]  That's literally that this game does not have, could not connect to server, but it's all right.
[696.42s -> 704.46s]  Are you sick? Yeah. Let's just say yes. So if I have a cricket, I can upgrade this cricket by,
[704.46s -> 733.98s]  oh, um, what happened? Did I get like banned? Oh, there we go. All right. Sick. Yeah. All right. So
[733.98s -> 743.82s]  I got a beaver. So, okay. So everybody has a certain thing that can happen, right? So when I
[743.82s -> 749.35s]  sell beaver, I do sound like fucked right now. So if I sell the beaver, he's going to give two
[749.35s -> 759.24s]  random people one health, but permanently, which is a big deal. Servers are bad. That's all right.
[759.24s -> 765.77s]  So I'm going to go, I, you know, I'm just going to fish. Win early, win early, win early, win early.
[765.77s -> 774.86s]  That's what I've been told. Win early. I'm going to upgrade the beaver because if you do two,
[774.86s -> 780.07s]  if you take a copy, put it on top of what you have there twice, bang, level it up.
[785.50s -> 789.64s]  Sell the beaver right now? Um, I don't know. And I'm going to lose the tournament. So don't
[789.64s -> 798.57s]  worry. But this is really fun. The game's actually really fun. Um, I feel like that's a waste.
[798.57s -> 809.35s]  Oops. Well, it did it anyways, I guess. Okay. Uh, let's roll. Should I buy the food? No,
[809.35s -> 820.70s]  we're just going to fish. Going fish at the back. I can combine this after. Oh, you can free stuff
[820.70s -> 833.56s]  too. I probably should have froze the ant. Yeah. I have maybe an hour or two in this game
[834.68s -> 841.34s]  and I'm going, I'm going up against like literally like the Galileo's of this game.
[845.66s -> 863.67s]  No, it's not a drill. Oh, well you studied though. Yeah, I did. All right. So some of these are
[863.67s -> 871.02s]  really, really cool. Like peacock, right? When a peacock gets hurt, it gets to attack. With
[871.02s -> 878.50s]  porcupine dies, it does two damage to everybody. And the, uh, the dromedary.
[888.38s -> 894.95s]  What am I doing here? What am I doing here? What am I doing here? I can't be in this. I
[894.95s -> 900.15s]  can't do this. I'm going to get fucking beat the first round and I'm going to like burp at somebody.
[904.54s -> 912.31s]  Okay. So, uh, stay calm, stay calm. All right. I'm going to stay calm. I'm relaxed. Yeah,
[912.31s -> 925.37s]  I'm relaxing. I'm fine. I'm, I got confidence. I should be just fine. Okay. I think we're about
[925.37s -> 941.02s]  to start. Oh no. I thought I was going to have at least like 20 minutes. Oh shit. They said, hey,
[941.02s -> 946.79s]  jump in the, jump in the general. Oh, okay. All right. I got to pretend like I'm not freaking out
[946.79s -> 953.10s]  about this. You know what I mean? Like the battleship tournament was, I knew what I was doing.
[953.10s -> 957.10s]  I know the game very well. It was like, oh, German, look, we're going to do a battleship thing.
[957.10s -> 960.22s]  I have no idea what's going on right now. And I like have to, I have to put out the air
[960.78s -> 981.30s]  that I, that I'm, I got it completely together here. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
[985.53s -> 1001.45s]  I'm so tired. When are we starting? What are you? Lud said we can be 10 minutes late. So I'm assuming
[1001.45s -> 1008.31s]  we're starting in 10 minutes. Okay. Cool. That's a freaking out. I just muted and deafened. I'm
[1008.31s -> 1025.96s]  freaking out. All right. All right. Um, let's go. I got to finish at least this thing here. Everybody,
[1025.96s -> 1041.77s]  everybody is stoned. Okay. Let's go back to what I was doing. No more fucking around. All right. So
[1041.77s -> 1047.99s]  when you combine, when you get to fish level two, they give everybody one, one, which is pretty good.
[1047.99s -> 1058.18s]  So, um, but I don't know if I want to do that right now. This will kill. Well, the word is faint,
[1058.18s -> 1066.71s]  right? You don't mute it. Just say it. Sell the beaver now. Yeah, that's actually a good idea.
[1066.71s -> 1075.72s]  But I, I can't get a over 10 gold, right? My mic is not, I, my mic is muted. Okay. I can see it
[1075.72s -> 1091.14s]  over here. No, not muted to you guys. Muted to everybody else. It's in that call. Okay. Uh,
[1092.73s -> 1107.18s]  can I, what if I do this? Hear me out. So let's combine the fish and then do I want peacock?
[1107.18s -> 1123.64s]  I would anyone ever not put the hedgehog first because that hurts everybody. They're talking
[1123.64s -> 1131.67s]  about me. No, they're not. Ludwig is literally muted in here. I can see people. Should I pull
[1131.67s -> 1137.48s]  the head? You want to try it? Um, I don't even know what I'm looking for here. What do I want
[1137.48s -> 1144.87s]  to even try to do? Let's go peacock. When the peacock gets hurt, then you get, it's like a frenzy
[1144.87s -> 1153.32s]  mode. All right. So let's keep the peacock back here. Unless I can get some food, which let's
[1153.32s -> 1171.46s]  roll for it. Hmm. Should I give her the cricket? Spider, spider is good. I think spider is just a
[1171.46s -> 1183.77s]  better cricket at this point. All right. So do I get, okay, do I get two spiders? Sell the beaver
[1183.77s -> 1199.46s]  or should I just level up the spider or should I, uh, cupcake the, uh, peacock?
[1199.46s -> 1207.08s]  Sell the otter. Yeah, I'm going to, I'll do that. Let's do that. That's what I wanted.
[1207.08s -> 1214.30s]  All right. We get two spiders. I don't want the shrimp. I do want this though,
[1214.30s -> 1220.70s]  because this just adds, this is a, one of the buffs. Okay. It looks like every people are
[1220.70s -> 1232.78s]  trickling in. Ludwig's watching you. Yeah. But I mean, uh, honey. Okay. I want the honey as well.
[1232.78s -> 1237.27s]  Having honey at the last person, the first like five rounds is incredibly important.
[1237.27s -> 1246.92s]  Spider only, that's not how it works. Why do they have little hats on? I put them on.
[1246.92s -> 1259.22s]  Called me profoundly new, but no, you have no idea. I was up all night last night preparing
[1259.22s -> 1270.14s]  for this. I'm going, I'm going peacock, whale, cheetah. And it's going to, it's going to,
[1270.14s -> 1285.50s]  everyone's going to be in a lot of trouble. I just want a game. Oh, I like this one. Okay.
[1285.50s -> 1292.57s]  Bat is S tier. I know that for a fact. I know it for a fact. So I got, I got to, okay. I need
[1292.57s -> 1304.63s]  to roll for a fish. I want bat. I want bat, but I want spider to have this because it's just five
[1304.63s -> 1309.91s]  more damage just permanently. And let's, it's taken off of course. All right. Let's give this
[1309.91s -> 1314.50s]  to you because that's just a win. Now what are we looking for? Excuse me. What are we looking for?
[1315.06s -> 1329.16s]  I actually don't remember, but we're going to combine the spider. So now at the start of battle,
[1329.16s -> 1334.26s]  this makes somebody weak and all week is, it took me a while. It took me about a couple hours to
[1334.26s -> 1340.30s]  figure this out. So weak is just a, like an equipment slot. You see on the right, it's a
[1340.30s -> 1346.15s]  bone attack, attack for five more damage. Honey bee, summon a one, one bee after fainting, right?
[1346.15s -> 1353.19s]  It replaces that on anybody that it hits. They're starting. That's literally last night entry.
[1353.91s -> 1360.73s]  Jerma, why are people coming in my chat saying he's blazed? Who's saying that? I'm having like
[1360.73s -> 1364.57s]  people come in here talking about how you have ancient peyote that the lions used.
[1365.37s -> 1370.55s]  Can I get some of that? I do not. I do not. I've just.
[1372.97s -> 1380.31s]  That was very convincing. Well, look, the game, we have some beginners. Can you explain the rules,
[1380.31s -> 1383.35s]  please? Like, I don't even know how the game works. I just installed it 15 minutes ago.
[1384.28s -> 1391.26s]  So the game, very simply, is an auto battler. You form a team of five, the best team you possibly
[1391.26s -> 1397.10s]  can. And the team will battle against a random person. So we're going to enter a 16 person lobby.
[1397.10s -> 1402.33s]  Everybody in this call will be playing. And then the top eight people from that,
[1402.33s -> 1406.73s]  from that giant group will go to a single elimination bracket. Just the sweaty people,
[1406.73s -> 1413.59s]  just the stans of the worlds. Okay. Let's relax. Let's relax. I'm here to have fun.
[1413.59s -> 1418.39s]  We'll go to a different bracket. All right. A less sweaty one, the me youngs. Okay.
[1419.19s -> 1422.23s]  Aren't so good at games. I want to get rolled. I have a chance.
[1422.23s -> 1428.30s]  Why is that called that? Everybody gets. So the winner of each one will get their own award.
[1429.18s -> 1434.78s]  If you win the champion bracket, you get your own custom hat in game. It's a trophy hat.
[1434.78s -> 1437.90s]  So you're the only person in the world who has it. If you win the losers bracket,
[1437.90s -> 1445.85s]  you get a joker hat. And then also four K for winner of champion two K for winner of losers.
[1448.12s -> 1457.58s]  Is that all? That's pretty cool. What? I just want a hat. I just wanted a hat.
[1459.42s -> 1464.71s]  Yeah. The hat sounds amazing. So that's, that's pretty much it. That's pretty much it. This is
[1464.71s -> 1468.71s]  not sponsored by the people keep saying I'm sponsored because I keep playing this game.
[1468.71s -> 1472.31s]  It's mostly because there's this bald guy on Twitch that I've watched a decent amount lately.
[1472.87s -> 1479.11s]  Hello. Oh, northern lion. Oh, I fell asleep to him last night.
[1482.41s -> 1487.05s]  To help out, by the way, I have a discord channel for all of you
[1487.05s -> 1490.92s]  because it doesn't make a lot of sense for all 16 of us to talk on a discord.
[1490.92s -> 1495.08s]  Uh, wait, that sounds fucking mean. That's not what I mean. Like, oh, hey,
[1495.08s -> 1498.76s]  I fall asleep to you all the time, dude. No, no, no, no. I mean, like I was,
[1498.76s -> 1501.64s]  I got to fucking correct that. I got to correct the record like right now,
[1501.64s -> 1506.12s]  but I can't like interrupt, right? Uh, and I, I predict if you win this,
[1506.12s -> 1512.44s]  it'll go max like three, four hours. And if you lose right away, it'll go like 90 minutes to two
[1512.44s -> 1517.24s]  hours. How do I jump in and correct this? I didn't know I did. That was not like a,
[1517.24s -> 1521.08s]  Hey dude, like I fall asleep. I fell asleep to your stream last night. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[1521.08s -> 1548.98s]  no. God, how do I, it's, it's too much time has passed. Nobody's talking. Uh, I caught the,
[1548.98s -> 1557.42s]  I didn't catch the last part. Uh, I said, okay, I didn't, this is going to be like a fun stream,
[1557.42s -> 1561.78s]  but I'm like having a great time right now. Like I thought this is going to be like a game or
[1561.78s -> 1566.74s]  stream where like, I got to focus. I got to really pay attention and no, no fun right now. I'm going
[1566.74s -> 1574.47s]  to, I'm trying to win. Point. Yeah. I should have, I should have clarified. I did forget about that
[1574.47s -> 1583.91s]  fact. Um, hold up, actually let me abandon this. Uh, so for this one, uh, everyone use the free pack
[1583.91s -> 1590.07s]  just for the large group. That makes sense. Whatever you want. If you duckstrap your lame,
[1590.07s -> 1597.99s]  just calling it out right now. I'm not going to do it. This is good. Call it duckstrap.
[1597.99s -> 1604.39s]  Do it. Don't do it. That's the duckstrap. My ducks for five turns and don't really use the DLC.
[1604.39s -> 1611.38s]  Don't leak my strats, bro. Well, I think, you know, there's no gift in the ducks. I've never
[1611.38s -> 1615.30s]  played this game and I'm probably going to get rolled because I don't even know what I'm looking
[1615.30s -> 1625.08s]  at here. Is there like a tutorial that I can look at? I just, I just picked the cutest ones.
[1625.08s -> 1630.52s]  Guys, I have no idea what I'm looking at here, man. I need like a tutorial or like a breakdown
[1630.52s -> 1639.27s]  video. Kind of a little too late for that. Northern lion as we time to have a three hour long tutorial
[1639.27s -> 1645.82s]  video. If you watch it on like 15 X, you might be able to digest it. Just go to Northern lion
[1645.82s -> 1651.10s]  tierless super autopets, go to the very end and then just look at that and then buy the S tier.
[1651.10s -> 1658.87s]  That's what I started. That's what I fell asleep to last night. I was lying there with the iPad
[1658.87s -> 1663.83s]  on my chest just trying to cram for the exam and I got, I got to the, I was on the Northern lion
[1663.83s -> 1672.65s]  video. I was like three, four o'clock in the morning. I put the playlist on and tried to
[1672.65s -> 1678.09s]  absorb it while I slept. I don't, by the way, I think scientifically that doesn't work, Dan.
[1678.89s -> 1682.89s]  Well, it looks like you're going to try again tonight and I'll put some more mid rolls in that.
[1683.61s -> 1693.35s]  Good for the next week. See if it works. Oh, the lobby's up. All right. No, do lobby. Oh,
[1694.95s -> 1699.26s]  yeah. I'm adding. Was there any rules that I needed to know when I missed or
[1699.98s -> 1705.90s]  go for it? No, you're good. All right. Just pack one. Yeah. Flat pack one for the first round.
[1705.90s -> 1713.21s]  So pack. So we all jump. We're just doing the same. Yeah. Everybody can just kind of hop in.
[1713.21s -> 1723.32s]  Wait, how do I join? So you go to a private game join and then you type in the code I put in chat.
[1724.87s -> 1730.07s]  It's because I didn't start at me. I kind of, I kind of reject. Make sure you don't leak. It's
[1730.07s -> 1738.39s]  very easy to do it. Is it easy to leak? Yeah. Yeah. Join private and enter game name. Okay.
[1738.39s -> 1744.15s]  Me young wins. She gets pretty good subs. Yeah. Don't say that. It's a rule. Okay.
[1745.78s -> 1751.78s]  Should I join or am I just going to like capture your stream or like screen share or? Yeah. My idea
[1751.78s -> 1757.64s]  was everyone will enter their own call and then screen share. So you can easily bounce around
[1757.64s -> 1768.14s]  watching POVs. Makes sense. Let me see how many people are in this. Ray is not streaming. I'm
[1768.14s -> 1772.15s]  going to get there in a second. He's like a spectator. Why is there 17? Oh, wow. This really
[1772.15s -> 1778.95s]  is super easy to leak. Yeah. It just shows that it's just there until it starts. So just say,
[1778.95s -> 1790.97s]  no, I did not leak. No, I did not 14. All right. So I think we're just missing
[1790.97s -> 1800.49s]  Saikuno and mango and then we're set. Uh, and I think one person in this call hasn't joined.
[1800.49s -> 1812.17s]  Is that right? Um, I haven't joined, but one extra person in addition to you. Okay. Okay.
[1815.16s -> 1818.84s]  You know, there's a chance Northern line. I don't know how much you want to risk it.
[1818.84s -> 1826.07s]  I don't think it'll go that long if you want to hop in and play. Here's the thing. Okay. I'm
[1826.71s -> 1831.43s]  there's two things. One is I already have a one of one hat in the game, so I wouldn't want to take
[1831.43s -> 1839.13s]  both of the one of ones. That's rude. And then the other one is I think my chat really has high
[1839.13s -> 1843.53s]  expectations. They expect me to win. And that's a lot of pressure because there's a lot of good
[1844.25s -> 1849.29s]  players, a lot of good analytical thinkers here. So I would rather just sidestep the entire
[1850.41s -> 1855.21s]  issue there and just commentate instead and act superior from an ivory tower. And then you
[1855.21s -> 1862.09s]  won the champion, like in the end of Pokemon elite four. Hey, that could work. Whoever wins
[1862.09s -> 1867.13s]  plays Northern line at the very end. That would be, it's like Pokemon. If every time that someone
[1867.13s -> 1872.81s]  loses, you just say, Oh, they should have watched my tier list. I actually, the tier list is out
[1872.81s -> 1879.77s]  of date with the new patch. Uh, I need to do a retcon, but I digress. Uh, Saikuno code is in
[1879.77s -> 1885.22s]  general. Yep. I'm already in it. Does, does this code leak after the lobby? Is there some way to
[1885.22s -> 1888.42s]  hide on the screen? Once you go into the game, you're good. Once we're live, I think we're good.
[1888.42s -> 1907.34s]  Yep. Uh, I think, is this everyone? I'm missing three people. Unless I'm terrible at math. I
[1907.34s -> 1915.78s]  feel like everybody in this call, if they joined, we would be at 16. I heard a distant whisper from
[1915.78s -> 1926.10s]  five up. I did not know what he said though. I can mute. What are you saying? Wicked rude.
[1926.10s -> 1932.66s]  What? Who me? I haven't even talked. Why am I wicked rude? I think I need another, I need
[1932.66s -> 1940.10s]  another coffee though, for sure. Yeah. The best part about like having, being a streamer that's
[1940.10s -> 1945.75s]  in a call with a bunch of other streamers is like, I, I can just leave. I'll be back in like two,
[1945.75s -> 1952.66s]  three minutes. I think he was in the bathroom. I think he's going there. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.
[1952.66s -> 1957.78s]  I grabbed it. Do I have time to grab a copy? Yeah, go for it. Anthony, you're in. Uh, yes, sir.
[1958.50s -> 1966.73s]  Yeah. Perfect. All right. Love that. Are you Alex? You're in. Yes, I am. Wonderful Buddha. Oh,
[1966.73s -> 1977.29s]  there's 16. Oh, it was the pooping man. Uh, can you just join and then, um, do the old, uh,
[1977.29s -> 1983.69s]  just drop from it. Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah. No problem. Then it'll, it'll start when he joins.
[1983.69s -> 1987.85s]  I guess we should wait a moment. Uh, so after it starts, just hop in your own discord and then
[1987.85s -> 1993.29s]  just discord screen share. You can just mute or deafen. I'm sure. Oh, discord screen share.
[1993.29s -> 1998.49s]  And then that's just an easier way to spectate. Oh, I might've boned Jerma right there. All right.
[1998.49s -> 2005.61s]  We're in. Oh, yeah. Let's get it. Do we restart? We might need a class restart because I did tell
[2005.61s -> 2012.09s]  them to go get coffee and then I forgot it. Yeah, I didn't even. Yeah, back out. Yeah, back out.
[2012.09s -> 2020.73s]  Yeah. More chances for ducks. Good thing I got bad RNG. I had three ducks, man. I had three.
[2021.78s -> 2025.85s]  I'm actually not playing ducks because I hate them. We were abandoning, right?
[2025.85s -> 2030.81s]  It's on principle. Yep. I respect that. Everyone's on the standard. Plus I get three.
[2030.81s -> 2037.45s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're leaving, right? Same. Good. Good. Wait, are we leaving? I love that.
[2037.45s -> 2041.72s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because Jerma's going to get coffee, right? Okay. Are we going to do some code?
[2041.72s -> 2045.56s]  It's going to do same code, but everyone can't join at once because if it starts again,
[2045.56s -> 2049.02s]  we'll have the same problem. Right. So everybody's got to leave first.
[2049.02s -> 2060.89s]  It's not letting me join the same code. Well, let's see. Well, yeah, I can't join either.
[2060.89s -> 2073.62s]  No, we're just we're just waiting, I think. Yeah, you're good. So I've never played this before.
[2073.62s -> 2080.10s]  Am I allowed to get help from chat or like, or is that like a no go? No, no, absolutely. Please do.
[2080.10s -> 2085.75s]  Okay. All right, cool. Yeah, because I'm going to this blind man. I have no idea what I'm looking
[2085.75s -> 2090.47s]  at. I think a few people are going in blind and I think that's why we have the bottom bracket.
[2090.47s -> 2094.55s]  So it's going to be it's going to be hilarious. It's going to be funny. It'll be good content.
[2094.55s -> 2098.87s]  I know we're going into you guys and it's going to be fine. We're going to get absolutely rolled
[2098.87s -> 2103.19s]  by the pros, but that's okay. All right. New lobby code. Normal line. I don't need to join this one.
[2103.19s -> 2111.14s]  We'll commentate together and hop through. Understood. All right. So 11 a.m. is early.
[2111.14s -> 2117.46s]  Is this what I'm understanding? Yes. It's late for me. It's late for you.
[2117.46s -> 2121.98s]  No, it's a joke, but I do wake up at like 9 a.m. right now.
[2121.98s -> 2123.98s]  Well, this guy's up at 4 a.m. in Japan.
[2126.58s -> 2131.70s]  Just know that after last night and he's like, what time is it? I was like 11 hours from now.
[2131.70s -> 2138.09s]  He's like, yeah, I'll just stay up. No, actually, I went to sleep for like four hours. Yeah, I had
[2138.09s -> 2142.73s]  to. Wendy and I were awake at 7 a.m. and we're like, we shouldn't go to sleep. We're not going
[2142.73s -> 2148.62s]  to wake up. Dude, I got two. I woke up to two flake messages from me, Young and Mango, both going
[2148.62s -> 2154.38s]  like, hey, don't hate me, but I might not be there. I'm back. Sorry. I feel like I'm holding
[2154.38s -> 2161.70s]  everybody up. I gave you my word. I didn't cook for the house to be here. I appreciate that.
[2162.58s -> 2166.04s]  It's a nice afternoon here in New York. That's all I'm saying.
[2166.04s -> 2172.39s]  Okay. Bad news. I think me on stream. Oh, she's back. Oh, I already lost a match.
[2172.39s -> 2176.15s]  Maybe your internet. No, no, no. We had to we backed out for you so you can back out.
[2176.15s -> 2181.56s]  Oh, okay. New code. It's in general. We have three more people who need to join. We're good.
[2181.72s -> 2188.68s]  Okay. Apparently Mango, because he's not on the call, was playing against bots.
[2191.30s -> 2194.50s]  He's like, wow, dude, so good. He literally said I was on a run.
[2198.07s -> 2209.16s]  So this is what happens when you win. Hello. Hello. Well, all right. I think we almost have
[2209.16s -> 2214.50s]  everyone. We just need two more. Yeah. What's the win condition? Is it collecting a bunch of
[2214.50s -> 2222.62s]  trophies like all the trophies? I think it's me young one and I don't know if there's mango
[2222.62s -> 2232.66s]  for sure. So if you get all the trophies, that's like a win condition. Like what would you consider
[2232.66s -> 2243.54s]  a win? So the way trophies in versus is it's lives and you will die and run out of lives.
[2243.54s -> 2251.51s]  So you just need to live longer than the other people in this call. Okay, I see. I don't know
[2251.51s -> 2255.19s]  exactly how they calculate how many lives you get because I feel like it varies sometimes
[2255.19s -> 2261.77s]  in the regular game mode. Would you guys consider up around one part, seven rounds to be good,
[2261.77s -> 2266.20s]  like eight crowns to be good. What's, what's like, all right, that was a good, that was a good run.
[2266.20s -> 2273.34s]  Yeah. Seven. It's good. Yeah. Seven. It's great. Yeah. So when I get like four under 10 personally,
[2273.34s -> 2278.06s]  but I can appreciate seven. What about, what about between like three and five? Is that considered
[2278.06s -> 2282.94s]  okay? Well, I should get at least five. I'm sorry. Did you hit it with a higher number
[2282.94s -> 2289.85s]  and then count where you're at? I think one to four is the only bad ones because you should just
[2289.85s -> 2294.95s]  play for, you should swing for the fences, right? Zero is better than four. So do you guys just
[2294.95s -> 2298.39s]  leave game? Like do you just abandon game if you have? No, no, because then you get a dunce hat
[2298.39s -> 2303.51s]  nowadays. They patch it. Oh. Yeah. The game makes fun of you if you abandon. So you have to play it
[2303.51s -> 2311.46s]  out like a hero. Wait, do I get a dunce hat if I already abandon them? No, if you abandon a bunch,
[2312.42s -> 2319.58s]  only pubs or something. All right. Yeah. The arena resetting for that perfect to triple fish.
[2319.58s -> 2325.90s]  Damn, so knowledgeable. I think it's just me young. I think she's having some audio
[2325.90s -> 2331.96s]  and stream problems. It just F. Yeah. I'm also just downloading steam. So I need to say, yeah.
[2331.96s -> 2348.78s]  I just said at least we know he has friends. Yeah. You're already wearing a dunce hat. I've
[2348.78s -> 2363.59s]  been wearing a dunce hat since at least 10 years ago. Okay. She played, see if they'll play among
[2363.59s -> 2372.02s]  us after this. Absolutely not. Only play Super Auto Pets on team. No, you can play on browser.
[2372.02s -> 2378.01s]  Right. It's better to play on browser in my opinion. There's a browser. Yeah, there's a
[2378.01s -> 2384.90s]  browser version. If you go to Teamwood games or whatever. The browser version. Hell yeah.
[2384.90s -> 2390.57s]  Where is that? I think it's teamwoodgames.com or just Google Super Auto Pets. Oh hell. They said,
[2390.57s -> 2410.52s]  I don't know. Wait, what? Among us, among us. No. Play Farmville. Ask Ludwig to the winter formal.
[2410.52s -> 2424.14s]  I can't tell if they're ignoring you. No, no, I'm muted. I'm unmuting when I have to ask
[2424.14s -> 2436.41s]  somebody something. I'm not just talking over everybody right now. Will, is it just you at
[2436.41s -> 2443.02s]  this moment? I have it. How do I join the game? Versus and then there's a code that Ludwig posted.
[2443.02s -> 2449.70s]  Yeah. In Discord. Versus and then join private. Okay, got it. Yeah. And then just the name.
[2449.78s -> 2454.58s]  Oh, yeah. Don't say it out loud because people can just snipe it. Yeah. I'm definitely leaked.
[2456.47s -> 2459.91s]  Go, Will. Go. It should be fine as long as Will joins in the next 13 seconds.
[2459.91s -> 2465.83s]  Oh, are you in? Is that you, Will? I'm in. Okay, that's us. Perfect. All right. Everybody off to
[2465.83s -> 2470.97s]  your own Discords. Okay. Own Discords. And then go live on Discord showing your perspective.
[2470.97s -> 2475.37s]  Yo, good luck, guys. Good luck. Oh, you might have to pull me from my stream. You guys are
[2475.37s -> 2479.93s]  going to need it, man. You're going to need it. Because they're about to get smacked, man. Okay.
[2479.93s -> 2488.01s]  I can't do that. I'm on my phone. You're good. I'm not sure I can do that. And I have, like,
[2488.01s -> 2494.41s]  program authority problems doing that for some reason. All right. Here we go. I'm ready. Are
[2494.41s -> 2498.18s]  you guys ready? We're not on, like, a time limit or anything, but I don't want to be slow. So,
[2498.18s -> 2510.52s]  hold on. Let me turn this up. All right. So, turn one. I, uh, all right. There is a timer.
[2510.52s -> 2513.88s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you see? Don't say that. Stop lying to me.
[2514.36s -> 2531.11s]  Oh, did I do it? I didn't know there was a timer. What the fuck? This looks, I look so stupid.
[2532.07s -> 2536.23s]  This is somebody that's never installed the game once. I can't fucking believe it.
[2537.75s -> 2547.10s]  I didn't know there was a timer. Oh, God damn it. That's, uh, it's oh, it's over. Like, I've,
[2547.10s -> 2553.77s]  I've fucked up everything. This is bad. This is really bad. Okay. Um, I didn't have a chance.
[2555.51s -> 2559.11s]  Okay, sell. Give two random friends one health. All right. I have to have at least two people for
[2559.11s -> 2570.71s]  this. Let's do bird again. And, um, beaver. Fuck. I'm so, I'm so thrown off. It's over.
[2570.71s -> 2581.77s]  I'm on the wrong pack. Oh, Jesus. Oh, no. How am I able to play in the game?
[2581.77s -> 2597.67s]  Okay. Why I have the wrong pack. This is, oh my God. I thought once we got into the game,
[2597.67s -> 2609.61s]  it would be all right, but like I'm in the wrong pack. I may as well just fucking lose and just
[2609.61s -> 2623.34s]  watch YouTube videos. Okay. So I don't know how I'm going to salvage this. I thought I was going
[2623.34s -> 2629.83s]  to do okay, but this whole thing started like as such a disaster. All right, here we go. Um,
[2630.54s -> 2633.98s]  I mean, does this really matter anymore? This is the worst team that's ever been put ever.
[2633.98s -> 2644.18s]  What do I want? All right. We have, I have to at least go. I have to get something on somebody
[2649.06s -> 2662.07s]  now. He's going to do seven damage. Uh, not the cat spider. I take so long to do these decisions.
[2662.07s -> 2675.58s]  That's why I'm not used to the timer. Did you lose? Oh, absolutely. Like literally the first two,
[2675.58s -> 2683.11s]  three turns. Like this is turn three and I live on discord. I don't think I can
[2683.11s -> 2705.32s]  the way that, uh, after through OBS, it always screws up. Let me see if I can get it to work.
[2705.32s -> 2723.53s]  Is this going to work? Oh, not the webcam. Yeah. I can't, I can't get it to do my video.
[2725.34s -> 2729.16s]  I've tried, I've tried this before. I'm going to be the first to be eliminated after this.
[2729.88s -> 2735.24s]  I just have to take this loss completely. Why am I throwing? I'm really not even trying to.
[2735.24s -> 2744.46s]  I just like have the wrong pack and the missed the first two rounds. All right, here we go.
[2744.46s -> 2754.97s]  I need another. No, I don't think I can do the rat right now. Let me do this.
[2759.10s -> 2777.30s]  So I get two peacocks. I think so. Okay. Well, this fish freeze fish and I got to move this.
[2777.30s -> 2785.83s]  So this is all right that I needed to be here. What do I want to have that attack you? Okay.
[2785.83s -> 2793.91s]  All right. Let me see. Share my, let me try to, let me see if I can get it to work.
[2793.91s -> 2812.57s]  Bind the fish. Yeah, I got a freezer mill. That first round just,
[2812.57s -> 2819.03s]  Oh, that's actually really good. That's really good. That might be the save right there. No,
[2819.03s -> 2844.54s]  definitely not. Unless I don't think so. No, too bad. I'm, I'm guaranteed to be the first person
[2844.54s -> 2861.32s]  up. All right. Can I salvage this somehow? I'm sitting there talking like a dickhead and I'm,
[2861.32s -> 2871.82s]  I wouldn't, I wouldn't pay any attention to this. Oh, should I give? Okay. If I, okay. If I find
[2871.82s -> 2884.95s]  another fish, then this is potentially salvaged. I'm going to give this to the peacock because
[2885.51s -> 2892.90s]  garlic on the peacock is great because you want the peacock to get hit. All right. Give me fish.
[2892.90s -> 2896.82s]  This is good though. This, this is, this is really good. I'm going to, I have to get rid of somebody.
[2896.82s -> 2901.54s]  I have to get rid of somebody, the spider, I think. I don't, I gotta get rid of the spider
[2901.54s -> 2929.03s]  and I have to put this on behind the peacock. Well, the bird, the bird has the meat. Okay. All
[2929.03s -> 2947.90s]  right. Come on. I got to pull this back. I'm gonna, I'm dead. It's not enough. That turn one, turn one
[2947.90s -> 2956.76s]  just killed me so bad. I can't. Well, okay. Now we're doing another one. We're doing more than one.
[2956.76s -> 2959.72s]  This is like, I'm going to fail the first one, obviously. All right. Here we go. Finally. All
[2959.72s -> 2966.89s]  right. All right. This is important. I want to freeze you. I want to give the meat to somebody.
[2966.89s -> 2972.84s]  All right. This is going to give one, one to everyone here. I'm going to, I gotta roll. I
[2972.84s -> 2986.62s]  gotta roll for something, for another peacock. Okay. Okay. All right. Look at that llama. If you
[2986.62s -> 2994.73s]  have four or less pets, that's not going to work, but we're going to do this. Oh shit. Okay. I,
[2994.73s -> 3000.12s]  I gotta get rid of somebody. Who do I get rid of? Probably the, the fish at this point needs to go
[3000.12s -> 3006.50s]  and I'll replace fish with rooster. I think that's a play. And I'm going to give rooster the meat
[3006.50s -> 3021.29s]  bone. Oh, okay. Or the chicken, maybe. Chick behind the rooster. I, all right. I, I, who do I sell
[3021.29s -> 3025.54s]  though? Who do I sell? Who do I sell the fish? Probably. Fuck. I don't have enough time to think
[3025.54s -> 3033.40s]  about this. I have to sell the fish, put the rooster up, and then I don't want to save any
[3033.40s -> 3038.44s]  of these people. Okay. All right. All right. Hold on. Freeze you. And then, oh God. Oh my God. Oh
[3038.44s -> 3043.53s]  my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Where do I go? Here. Here. Like that. Okay. Cause this, yep. All
[3043.53s -> 3052.15s]  right. We're good. Everything's fine. Cause he gets the buff from the bird. All right. All right.
[3052.15s -> 3058.46s]  Come on, Gwen. Let's go. He's got the garlic armor. Garlic armor means take two less damage.
[3059.10s -> 3066.10s]  This is going to be a win. No, it's not. That was so much overconfidence, but nothing.
[3066.66s -> 3079.67s]  I actually think I'm okay. Well, I didn't lose. Oh, that's right. He, he summons the chick. Okay.
[3082.38s -> 3105.21s]  Wowee. Ho wowee. Let's do this. This sucks. If you buy a tier one pet, give current and future pets
[3105.21s -> 3113.83s]  one, one. I don't. Bison is, seems pretty good if you have a level three. I like this game,
[3113.83s -> 3121.37s]  but I'm not very good. All right. I need to figure this out. Um, I don't want any of these.
[3126.87s -> 3134.44s]  The dog might be all right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, he's not. No. Uh, let's just feed
[3134.44s -> 3153.94s]  some people cause he gets buff from food and, um, uh, worm is actually kind of good. I don't
[3153.94s -> 3177.34s]  know if I want to keep the worm over the potential, uh, okay. All right. I just need
[3177.34s -> 3185.91s]  to warm up round. That's fine. That's that, that shark is going to be a big problem though.
[3185.91s -> 3191.83s]  This is a problem, but I, if the, I can last a pretty long time here with that garlic armor.
[3191.83s -> 3198.42s]  That's fun to say when you've been fucking lost it, isn't it? That's all right. I can handle it.
[3200.71s -> 3212.07s]  God damn it. What is this? All right. If you're watching my perspective, I didn't play the first
[3212.07s -> 3215.19s]  two rounds. I didn't know there was a timer. I was talking to Chad about pancakes and waffles
[3215.19s -> 3218.55s]  and shit. I didn't know there was a timer and I'm using the wrong pack anyway, so I'm disqualified.
[3218.55s -> 3233.82s]  So I'm, I'm out. Is anybody else out? Oh, okay. Other people were out. It wasn't just me. I wasn't
[3233.82s -> 3248.12s]  the first one out. All right. Let me get in there with the right pack, with the right mindset,
[3248.12s -> 3254.38s]  with the right everything. You know what I mean? Let me get back in there. Oh my God. He gave 35
[3254.38s -> 3269.85s]  subs Tommy B. Thanks a lot. I'm going to come back. Yeah. Lower bracket legend. Well, I, I'm
[3272.22s -> 3290.84s]  finished the tier list. Yeah. I have to go here. All right. This game is really fun, but
[3291.64s -> 3299.22s]  all right, we need to change the hat. Let's put the flower hat on. Okay. I'm ready now.
[3299.78s -> 3310.01s]  He cheated and he lost. I feel like people are just like clapping for me because I'm the old guy.
[3310.65s -> 3316.06s]  You know what I mean? Like, oh, German. Yeah. Come on. Come on over to the,
[3316.06s -> 3322.38s]  to the tournament we're going to do. Oh yeah. There you are. Hi. Yep. Your seat's right there.
[3322.38s -> 3329.34s]  Grandpa. Right at the end of the table. I clicked a click to use a different pack
[3329.34s -> 3337.27s]  that everybody else is using. Yep. Grandpa. Hi. I don't even play the first three rounds.
[3338.39s -> 3343.51s]  Oh, do you see grandpa just took just, just, I have to pay $2. I landed on park place for grandpa.
[3344.15s -> 3345.98s]  What time is dinner?
[3363.16s -> 3373.94s]  You're not. I know. I'm just kidding. I was kidding. Don't worry. Uh, so who's, who's actually
[3373.94s -> 3379.51s]  winning? I just watched one of the other perspectives or should I just do some practice
[3380.39s -> 3393.46s]  practice? Well, uh, good luck and congratulations to all the winners.
[3394.18s -> 3400.12s]  Let's do some practice. All right. And if I had a second, you know what I mean? Like I would have
[3400.12s -> 3407.27s]  already done this shit, like horses, bottom tier, absolute zero. And there you are. And there it is.
[3407.27s -> 3415.93s]  And there it is. That's a great starter. We're going to be the shy. We're going to be the shy
[3415.93s -> 3440.66s]  feet. The frigid legs. I like that one too. Yeah. I like this one. So now we got a team, right?
[3440.66s -> 3458.97s]  Rigid legs. Okay. It's fine. Mosquito is good. All right. Now this is important. We're going to
[3458.97s -> 3465.88s]  give this to, who do I want to give this to? We'll get a beaver and maybe a mosquito just to round
[3465.88s -> 3474.84s]  it out. And then we're going to give the, let's roll. Okay. This is good. This is really good.
[3474.84s -> 3485.14s]  I do this now though, or should I wait as technically you get tier two and then you can
[3485.14s -> 3492.17s]  go to tier three, right? Cause when you, when you get to three of the same, right? As if you,
[3492.17s -> 3496.33s]  when you see me combine stuff, when it's a leveling up the creature, when you do that,
[3496.33s -> 3503.27s]  it gives you the next tier. It pulls from the next tier of animals for you to play with. So
[3503.27s -> 3511.11s]  shouldn't I wait for that to happen for us to go to tier two? So then I can just get a tier three
[3511.11s -> 3518.49s]  kind of next turn. Yeah. From my understanding. So then I'm going to freeze you and give this just
[3518.49s -> 3524.44s]  to the person in the back, which is by the way, a guaranteed win early on. If you honey the back
[3524.44s -> 3539.88s]  line here, this person here, it's pretty much a guaranteed win. Cause nobody does that. This
[3539.88s -> 3547.53s]  should be a pretty, this should be it. I think it's going to be all right. Everybody does that. I
[3547.53s -> 3570.09s]  know they're all going to lose. Okay. So now I have tier two. This is where combine this. I want
[3570.09s -> 3582.95s]  somebody else up here though. And I don't want it to be a cricket or start summoning. I don't have
[3582.95s -> 3590.89s]  anything that is synergy synergizes. I don't have anything that synergizes with the dog is the worst
[3590.89s -> 3598.84s]  stream of the year. Well, yeah. Right. I actually, I don't think so. I don't know. I feel like this
[3598.84s -> 3607.34s]  is going to get good buying the fish. Yeah. But I want another person to get the one one. Hmm. Okay.
[3607.34s -> 3623.30s]  Well, I know I'm doing this because it's just so good early. Maybe beaver. Hmm. Copy health from
[3623.30s -> 3633.62s]  friend ahead. Uh, every time he attacks, he hurts the person behind him. So you need somebody that
[3633.62s -> 3639.29s]  takes like a hurt does this. Hmm. It's really funny watching you fail. It's probably why you
[3639.29s -> 3650.30s]  got invited. Hey, now I can't afford the fish. Oh, shit in my pants. You're right. I'll do it next
[3650.30s -> 3680.92s]  turn. Hmm. Spider, I guess I should be upfront too. This is annoying. And then this will kill.
[3680.92s -> 3693.83s]  And then, yeah, that's fine. Remember you suck at this game. Yeah. Well, you know,
[3695.67s -> 3714.09s]  that's fine. I think this is a win. Hey, I still, I still think I got this. Wow. Um, nevermind.
[3714.09s -> 3723.85s]  No, no, I do. Yeah, I got it. Why does he only read from the room chats? Because I have, uh,
[3723.85s -> 3730.62s]  I have this, uh, third party app that just shows only specific keyword, uh, users and stuff. So,
[3730.62s -> 3743.75s]  um, loser, stupid, idiot, dumb, um, slow, uh, hurry up, too slow, speed, uh, brain. Brain's a big one
[3743.75s -> 3762.41s]  that I look for. Yeah. I take my time. Sorry. I take my fucking time. Holy shit. Okay. So let's
[3762.41s -> 3769.86s]  go with, I want the swan. The swan is very good. So I'm going to get rid of the mosquito
[3769.86s -> 3781.37s]  before I do that. This is no, no, I'm going to do a big brain play. If I kill this, it'll give
[3781.37s -> 3789.10s]  it's two, one to you. Put up the goose, do the level up. And then here we go. One, one. There's
[3789.10s -> 3800.81s]  the giraffe. End turn. Give friend a head. One, one. Ooh. Uh, is that better? Should I get rid
[3800.81s -> 3818.38s]  of the beaver now? I think so. Nice. Okay. Let's put the giraffe up. Fuck it. Why did it say that?
[3818.38s -> 3836.73s]  That's the only time it's ever said the name of any animal. Oh, that's good. The dodo bird.
[3836.73s -> 3849.38s]  I like the dodo bird. Um, okay. New germa frog. Cause you can call a germa a dumb ass. Yeah,
[3849.38s -> 3855.64s]  that's fine. The giraffe to spider. So this, the spider is going to start to get a little bit,
[3855.64s -> 3863.75s]  a little beefed up. Oh, maybe not. We'll see what happens next turn. I want this though,
[3863.75s -> 3882.38s]  cause I want it for the spider. All right. Let's go. I got like frozen halfway through that one.
[3882.46s -> 3893.22s]  It's too early. Too bad. It's the giraffe that's going to get the melon armor,
[3893.22s -> 3905.51s]  which you get one hit for free. And he's going to just buff up this guy. Um, just barely,
[3905.51s -> 3923.80s]  just barely. We get to have a draw. Badger when it dies, deal attack damage to adjacent pets.
[3923.80s -> 3948.02s]  That kind of sucks though, doesn't it? Shit. Ooh. The ox is good too. I'm keeping the ox.
[3948.02s -> 3961.13s]  And should I replace, um, who should I replace with this? I'm freezing everything in a peacock.
[3961.13s -> 3968.79s]  Don't want the peacock. All right. This should be good next round. Yeah. I'll get rid of the
[3968.79s -> 3980.92s]  mosquito. I, the spider will start to carry this when the spider starts to carry, that's where it's
[3980.92s -> 3984.68s]  going to get good. Right? So I can get over, I'll get rid of three of his first three characters.
[3984.68s -> 3996.50s]  I have enough to kill his Dodo. Oh God. I, it's going to be, yeah, I do. I went,
[3996.50s -> 4010.52s]  that's why you always put the B in the back. Give something to the giraffe. Yeah. I think
[4011.08s -> 4020.07s]  mosquito goes away. All right. Who am I going to give the garlic to? Swan. I think Swan gets
[4020.07s -> 4033.27s]  the garlic. He's got the most health besides spider. I'm going to sell the mosquito. I'm going
[4033.27s -> 4046.41s]  to buy the ox. So now the ox, when this thing dies, it summons something, which when that dies,
[4046.41s -> 4050.41s]  he, so he's going to get this twice and melon armor and he's going to get hit with one ones.
[4050.41s -> 4059.78s]  So he's going to be buffing the ox. The ox now needs the garlic armor. And then we round it out
[4059.78s -> 4067.78s]  with, uh, leveling up the spider. I think, I think that's all right. Let's see what happens.
[4078.01s -> 4084.18s]  So the tournament, I think it's, I think they're still doing it. They have players here that are
[4084.18s -> 4090.20s]  real. Oh my God. That was 30 damage. So it just ended. All right. Well, we'll get into it.
[4090.20s -> 4096.12s]  See what's happening here. Every time somebody dies in front of him, he gets to get two more
[4096.12s -> 4106.66s]  health. I mean, two more damage that worked out, but I, I think this is a win. This is,
[4106.66s -> 4127.08s]  Oh no, it's not. Damn it. They're waiting for you. Let me find out. Hey, you think, well,
[4128.04s -> 4133.88s]  it's unfortunate you did make it through because you slightly cheated there by using the payday.
[4136.49s -> 4141.93s]  Listen, I was told I could use whatever pack I wanted to. I did the same thing. You were told
[4141.93s -> 4156.57s]  that yes. Uh, this was the common conception among the pro circuit. I'm glad I wasn't the only one
[4156.57s -> 4162.74s]  I got. I'm sweating. I was, I was here and prepared like yesterday too. And it's like,
[4162.74s -> 4169.43s]  Oh yeah, I don't even know what I did. What did I do? You used the pay to win pack and I said it
[4169.43s -> 4174.63s]  was free to, uh, free to win only for this one. And then I said, uh, the main lobby, my bad. I
[4174.63s -> 4180.07s]  didn't even know I was using a browser version. Yeah. You know, I think we'll, we'll, we'll let
[4180.07s -> 4184.39s]  it slide. I honestly don't think it's like, um, a big difference maker. I mean, if you don't expect
[4184.39s -> 4188.79s]  that it can be a little weird, but I don't think pay to win is better than free to win even.
[4191.10s -> 4200.55s]  Uh, I have no idea which bracket I'm in. Was I the only one who didn't buy pets on the first round?
[4200.55s -> 4209.99s]  No, I didn't. I'm sitting there. I'm sitting there. I'm not knowing like what I'm looking at,
[4209.99s -> 4215.27s]  right? I'm thinking I'm looking at the fucking starting screen, which I was I go into battle.
[4215.27s -> 4219.35s]  My chat's like, you didn't buy any pets. I'm like, what do you mean? I literally get rolled.
[4219.35s -> 4222.63s]  And then the second round, I finally have pets. And then the people have more pets than me.
[4223.03s -> 4230.26s]  It's got to absolutely demolish. I just, I just didn't know that I didn't know there was a timer.
[4230.26s -> 4235.30s]  I said it to the normal pets. Now I was quite confused. You can play whatever you want. Now
[4235.30s -> 4238.49s]  I was against the lady bug. And then the second round, there was a person with one pet.
[4240.74s -> 4245.06s]  You can play any deck in the second will might be in a one V one against me though,
[4245.06s -> 4250.58s]  for the eighth spot. So, oh, well, no, no, I believe you guys are both, uh, in top eight.
[4250.58s -> 4256.10s]  You guys didn't draw, but you drew. So I think it's logic stands five up Abe,
[4256.10s -> 4263.90s]  Yeti, Ray, Dan, and Will. Uh, and then the other bracket is, uh, Wendy,
[4263.90s -> 4272.98s]  Jerma, Saikuno, Mango, Buddha, Anthony, Otto, Alex. Very cool. Uh, I believe is the seating for each
[4272.98s -> 4278.81s]  or not the seating with the people on each. Um, and then give me just like a couple of minutes.
[4278.81s -> 4281.69s]  I'll get the seating up and then we'll start the tournament and everyone can just play one
[4281.69s -> 4289.08s]  V one at once. Sounds good. Let's do it. All right. Did you say any pack this time? Does it matter
[4289.08s -> 4293.32s]  on this any pack? Yeah. Any pack's fine. Any pack. I would just recommend buying.
[4293.32s -> 4303.54s]  I'm going to play Anthony in the first round, please. Just don't buy pets again, please.
[4303.54s -> 4308.44s]  No problem. You know what, man? I got, I got a nasty little strat.
[4308.44s -> 4314.90s]  It's a lot. You can go ahead and see that one. We've agreed to it is really fun. It is a great
[4314.90s -> 4329.30s]  game. I've been so addicted to him. Oh, he played it so bad. I feel all right. I'm muted over there.
[4329.30s -> 4331.86s]  All right. So let me, let me see if I can play this out because I feel like this is going to get
[4331.86s -> 4338.78s]  all right. So the shark is one versus one. I'm around for the other brackets or is it just like
[4338.78s -> 4342.70s]  the rest of it is all white. I believe so. Yeah. I think I get rid of the night. No one from the
[4342.70s -> 4347.34s]  winter black bracket plays somewhere to the draft bracket. No, no, it's two groups of eight.
[4347.82s -> 4354.44s]  That would be so important. Number eight winner that and then it goes up to the end.
[4354.44s -> 4359.88s]  Oh, simultaneous matches, right? Yeah. I feel like I need to replace somebody, probably the fish.
[4359.88s -> 4367.13s]  So it's like first and eight seeds or some shit. I would assume so. I don't know how they roll me.
[4367.13s -> 4371.96s]  Is that what's going on? It's way better if they randomize it though. Yeah, they should randomize
[4371.96s -> 4380.52s]  it. Well, I just have a stream. He had the bracket two, seven, one, eight. Oh, no. I mean,
[4380.52s -> 4387.82s]  will and logic means I don't know. Me versus Aiden. Do I have time to use the bathroom?
[4390.97s -> 4401.58s]  All right. I think we've got like a minute or two here. What? He killed it. What? What happened?
[4401.58s -> 4409.38s]  How did he kill that? Oh, that's that's actually pretty good. I'm happy about this.
[4409.38s -> 4420.57s]  Did we all take a few hits? Come on. Well, that sucks. The whole reason I bought the
[4420.57s -> 4432.22s]  shark and he died instantly. They should better at this game than Mario Kart.
[4432.30s -> 4442.76s]  Now, that's the first round. I really I swear to God it was I just wasn't prepared. I was.
[4442.76s -> 4446.20s]  But you know what I mean? Like it just I was all fucked up. I missed the first two rounds.
[4446.20s -> 4449.96s]  And then it was like at that point I was just buying. I just bought the first three random
[4449.96s -> 4459.43s]  things I could find. This one will be better. I promise. Skunk is good. Oh, OK. Wait,
[4459.43s -> 4467.72s]  I need stuff that dies and comes back. Spiders like let's get the I need stuff that like dies
[4467.72s -> 4474.22s]  and comes back like another spider, I guess. Another giraffe. This is good.
[4486.06s -> 4496.52s]  All right. All right. All right. Check back and make sure what should just played better.
[4498.98s -> 4503.80s]  Predict the bet. Yeah, that's my fault. I should I chose the wrong pack. I think we're good.
[4503.80s -> 4509.58s]  I'm still got time. All right. We want that spider. I want this pair. And now this if I get this to
[4509.58s -> 4514.39s]  a two, that means he'll give something in front of him to two, which is huge. All right, let's go.
[4514.39s -> 4521.77s]  This time, don't die. Can you say hello? Hello to my friend, Ben Dover.
[4521.77s -> 4534.92s]  Come on, Ben. Hope the Dover family is doing well. Oh, there we go. All right.
[4534.92s -> 4544.28s]  Feed the hell out of that shark. Stop that. This might be a victory.
[4544.28s -> 4551.83s]  No, maybe not. Do I have enough to get through both of them? I think I do.
[4554.60s -> 4563.43s]  No, it's going to be. Yeah, I do. No, you probably have some friendly banter.
[4563.43s -> 4567.19s]  I don't see a problem. You could have friendly banter. There's no problem with that. It's more
[4567.19s -> 4574.46s]  so for me to spectate and chat when you when you join. Yeah, we'll just meet up. Yeah. Yeah.
[4574.46s -> 4577.00s]  We'll just hop in. I guess if we're not in there, it's totally fine,
[4577.00s -> 4581.40s]  because most people we won't be in there for. That's not perfect entertainment for our own
[4581.40s -> 4587.93s]  stream. Yeah. How do we know who we're going to get? It's in the bracket. OK. OK. OK.
[4593.42s -> 4600.14s]  Do we make the games now? Yeah, we'll just you're going to hop in the call. Yeah, make the game
[4600.14s -> 4605.64s]  against each other to make the game, by the way, if you guys don't know, all you need to do is to
[4606.20s -> 4612.46s]  create private game, hit Max players to make the name and then just put it in general chat and at
[4612.46s -> 4618.87s]  the person. All right. So who are we out here? Well, I should be good makers. All right, logic.
[4618.87s -> 4624.95s]  I'll jump in your little thingamabob in discord. Sounds good. By the way, this is a best of one.
[4624.95s -> 4631.43s]  You can use any pack. OK. And we get eliminated. You're out. Should we be in the same
[4631.51s -> 4639.21s]  call as our opponent? Yes. OK. And then are we streaming our perspective on discord? Yeah. I
[4639.21s -> 4643.61s]  mean, only one you really know. I guess it'd be a bit cool. Both of you did. Yeah. It is stream your
[4643.61s -> 4649.21s]  POV. OK. Yeah. Something about the way that my stuff hooks in through OBS, it like it always shuts
[4649.21s -> 4654.90s]  off. Yeah, I know you're shit. Fucked. That's good. You're good. Sorry about that. And also,
[4654.90s -> 4661.34s]  if you don't start round two is the only other thing. Oh, OK. So wait until everyone's done.
[4661.34s -> 4667.59s]  Yeah. All right. We we good. Can we just kind of just stand and go off? Go off. Go off. All right.
[4667.59s -> 4675.98s]  Just enter your group or just enter wherever. Good luck, everybody. Where am I going? What's
[4675.98s -> 4688.18s]  up with all the licks in your chat? I don't I don't know. I mean, they like licking. How did you have
[4688.18s -> 4694.60s]  my chat open? I am streaming your stream and then putting my face over your face so people don't
[4694.60s -> 4702.79s]  notice that there's an audio to video delay. Appreciate you telling me. All right. Where am
[4702.79s -> 4711.62s]  I going? Round one, group four. Jerma, you are up against Wendy. Wendy. Yeah. So just any call
[4711.62s -> 4718.49s]  of Wendy. You can enter. Yeah. You know, people didn't really, you know, heed to the to the group
[4718.49s -> 4723.72s]  location. I see. I see. They're going to pick a random one of these rooms. You could just pick
[4723.72s -> 4734.38s]  any room. OK. How about round one, group one? That sounds good. Oh, there was another round
[4734.38s -> 4739.19s]  one group one. Oh, is there two of them? Yeah, there's a constellation, which is the one where
[4740.30s -> 4744.70s]  well, I did not do very well last round. Good. I'll be very honest. I made the pass already. It's
[4744.70s -> 4751.85s]  a woohoo yay. If you check the general channel, I added you. Oh, is that the name of the game?
[4751.85s -> 4763.32s]  Because I think that I may have just screamed you saying that when we get in. It's so easy.
[4763.32s -> 4782.57s]  OK, so versus mode, join private. That is the new pass for us. Very cool. All right. I don't
[4782.57s -> 4790.39s]  want to leak it. Don't think I should be in. All right. So this is don't do don't do around
[4790.39s -> 4798.58s]  two. We're just doing this once. Yeah. All right. Well, good luck. So how much how much experience
[4798.58s -> 4806.74s]  you have with the game? I play like a decent amount, but I'm not that good at it. OK. Yeah,
[4806.74s -> 4816.62s]  because I've been playing for about an hour or two, maybe. I'm going to try though. Yeah.
[4819.62s -> 4825.27s]  There's a timer, right? Timer. Illegal sausages. That's me. I need a name, too.
[4829.66s -> 4834.76s]  Did that in the wrong order. But, you know, get everything correct every time.
[4843.29s -> 4848.02s]  I need a team name, too. It took so long.
[4851.37s -> 4859.32s]  The talkative piggies. How does that sound? Well, I've got some piggies on my team. OK,
[4859.32s -> 4870.30s]  you don't got any on yours. No, I think I'm going otter strat. Otter strat.
[4872.12s -> 4876.71s]  Fifteen health. Oh, wow. This is going to be interesting. This will get interesting.
[4876.71s -> 4890.15s]  So I can't we can't really talk strategy because you're right here. That's right. We can't.
[4894.47s -> 4903.14s]  Well, I got the mute button. All right. What do I do? Why this game? This game has a way of
[4903.14s -> 4910.89s]  doing weird things. Yeah, it's the servers get kind of hammered, don't they?
[4911.61s -> 4923.24s]  All right. I think I ran out of time. I'm muted. Don't worry. God damn it.
[4936.79s -> 4949.61s]  Nice. Very nice. I'm definitely going to go. I guess I'm going to switch it up a little. Let's
[4949.61s -> 4968.63s]  see. Does the buff work? I don't know. I'm very I'm very curious. We'll find out.
[4968.63s -> 4998.60s]  Timer gets me like every time. Yeah, I actually didn't know there was a timer in the first in
[4998.60s -> 5002.76s]  the seating. So I like totally messed up one of my rounds and I was like, no.
[5004.18s -> 5009.46s]  Yeah, I didn't play pets on the first two rounds, I don't think, because I was just talking. Oh,
[5009.46s -> 5027.67s]  my God. I know I was so distracted. I'm just so distractible. Oh, yeah. I got to try to try
[5027.67s -> 5056.92s]  to beef that dodo up. Oh, it's gonna be close. Guys, I think it's time for ant. Do you think so?
[5057.80s -> 5066.02s]  Get rid of cricket. Go for ant. No, wait, get rid of cricket. Go for ant. That's I just said
[5066.02s -> 5089.43s]  the exact same thing. Nothing that I said changed. OK, is that it? The dodo needs. Oh,
[5089.43s -> 5105.21s]  shit. Thirty seconds. The dodo needs the buff. Hmm. OK. Oh, I realize we should be streaming
[5105.21s -> 5111.88s]  our stuff. Yeah. For some reason, when I try to hook through to do both, it doesn't capture
[5111.88s -> 5115.32s]  one of them. And usually the one it doesn't capture is the stream I'm streaming to.
[5116.68s -> 5146.39s]  I don't know why. I think I got a big play next turn. I'll see. Crab. What does the crab do?
[5146.39s -> 5195.29s]  Poppies. Dodo is so good. Oh, no. I do that wrong. I may have just done that completely wrong. Oh,
[5195.29s -> 5286.09s]  well, that's a beefed up pig. Oh, OK. All right. All right. All right. OK. I got a minute. I'm
[5286.09s -> 5293.51s]  sitting there freaking out. I thought I had like 10 seconds left. I'm also trying to think about
[5293.51s -> 5359.22s]  my life choices over here, man. Yeah. Hmm. OK. OK. I don't think it's going to be enough
[5359.22s -> 5396.78s]  until maybe next round. Oh, that crab, that crab getting beefy. I'm not throwing. I'm not throwing.
[5396.78s -> 5401.45s]  I have to mute. I don't want to sound like a weirdo, like like I'm screaming at people.
[5401.45s -> 5408.73s]  I'm not throwing. He sucks. You know, I'm not going to say you. I'm going to say no.
[5409.29s -> 5414.81s]  Leave me alone. OK. The play is give the meat to the deer because the deer is going to do five,
[5414.81s -> 5420.18s]  six damage and it's going to do five damage to splash damage. And then the play after that is
[5420.18s -> 5432.39s]  going to be mosquito. No, sell. I'm going to sell the mosquito and put the kangaroo in and then put
[5432.39s -> 5444.49s]  the kangaroo behind here. I don't know. Who am I selling here? Oh, my God. I have 20 seconds. Oh,
[5444.49s -> 5473.06s]  my God. OK. Play. I usually like take forever to think. So this timer is freaking me out. Yeah.
[5474.65s -> 5477.45s]  The only experience I have with the game is with no time or just sitting there,
[5477.45s -> 5492.62s]  just going, hmm, no, I wonder what that would do. Yeah. Well, I think I'm in trouble here.
[5492.62s -> 5507.24s]  I think that's what one or two more or no, two, three more. And then that's it. If you win.
[5508.62s -> 5523.53s]  How much else do you have? I have five. I think like two more. And it looks good.
[5523.53s -> 5550.17s]  He was saying, why do I still have the otter? It's cute. He's got a cute hat on.
[5550.17s -> 5570.81s]  Oh, you have hats. Oh, I have little bear hats. That's a lot of damage.
[5570.81s -> 5594.66s]  Oh, the monkey monkey's amazing. All right. Well, see what happens. This is my last attempt here.
[5596.14s -> 5609.72s]  See if I can pull through. Hmm. Your dual core CPU brain is overheating.
[5611.67s -> 5629.75s]  I have at least a Pentium three. OK. Oh, shit. That's they just gave me like every
[5629.75s -> 5684.28s]  big top tiered pet in the whole game right now. OK, pivot angle. Hmm. Oh, oh, you got the turkey
[5684.28s -> 5688.28s]  and the cow. Yeah, I think it might be it might be too little too late, though.
[5688.28s -> 5716.66s]  That is a GG. I wish you luck in the remainder of the tournament. Thanks. It's going to take for
[5717.54s -> 5723.35s]  to go through the winners finish and then the losers bracket. And then I have a feeling it's
[5723.35s -> 5728.63s]  going to go back and forth a lot in those higher. I'm like curious as how it's going to play out.
[5728.63s -> 5739.56s]  I need some more practice. Yeah, me too. Isn't that why we're here?
[5740.20s -> 5743.88s]  Yeah, well, Ludwig was like, hey, you want to play in the tournament?
[5743.88s -> 5749.03s]  I'm doing super autopets tournament and I'm like, sure, I'll give it a whirl.
[5749.75s -> 5755.35s]  It's really fun. It's actually like a really fun game. It is really fun. It's also really
[5755.35s -> 5772.66s]  infuriating. Mm hmm. Tournament loser speed run. Did I lose? Did I lose the fastest?
[5772.66s -> 5787.96s]  I have no idea. I think we have to report the winner or loser, right?
[5788.78s -> 5795.46s]  Uh, yeah, we just put it in general. I would assume so.
[5796.02s -> 5814.02s]  Okay. Have you played the DLC pack? I have, yeah. Do you like it more or?
[5814.02s -> 5823.18s]  I really can't even tell because I like the bugs. The bugs are cool. But besides the bugs,
[5824.06s -> 5830.07s]  it kind of gets messy. Let me wait. Let me take a look. Yeah, the Beatles are cool.
[5831.22s -> 5838.23s]  The what else we got? Is it bad in the main game? Because that's incredible.
[5838.23s -> 5846.39s]  Sorry, what did you say? Is the bad in the base game? Oh, sure. Because that's probably one of
[5846.39s -> 5854.76s]  the best abilities in the game to give somebody weak. I don't think it's in the base game.
[5854.76s -> 5860.04s]  Yeah, the bat replaces whatever you have for a buff with weakness. Oh, okay. Yeah,
[5860.04s -> 5870.20s]  it's not in the base game. Yeah, that character is insane. What else is in here? It's happy cats
[5870.20s -> 5878.63s]  new too. I mean, everything is kind of new to still people in the base game. I have no idea
[5878.63s -> 5886.50s]  how to play with a lobster poodle. Yeah, I haven't played with any of them.
[5892.60s -> 5900.23s]  Talk about you being the sus guy. What are you talking about? What are you doing? I'm hey,
[5900.23s -> 5905.69s]  I'll buy the link. It's just case you do not. I'm the sus guy. I think that would be like a okay,
[5905.69s -> 5913.94s]  like who cares? What are you talking about? Well, I lost the tournament, but I'm the sus guy. I get
[5913.94s -> 5929.93s]  to keep that. That's what I get to keep with me. That's like a double loss. Do you get points?
[5929.93s -> 5937.58s]  It's 5000 points to buy a new background. Yeah, I think so. Let me see. Or you can just purchase
[5937.58s -> 5943.21s]  it around. Oh, yeah, I guess so. Oh, actually, no, there's some with like 500 points and like
[5943.21s -> 5947.72s]  1000 points or something. I don't really care about the background. So I feel like the hats
[5947.72s -> 5956.47s]  are way better. Oh, yeah. I would definitely spend that money here. There's a lot of hats too.
[5956.47s -> 5963.93s]  A lot of cute hats. Yeah. I love how the 5000 point one is a golden poop as if that's the thing
[5964.01s -> 5970.95s]  that like shows that you're a true winner. How long does it take to get to 5000 points?
[5970.95s -> 5983.08s]  I don't know. I feel like it comes pretty quickly. Hey, what's up? Oh, wait, he's just,
[5983.08s -> 5994.84s]  I guess was spying on us and then left. Yep. I think people made new channels. Yeah,
[5994.84s -> 5999.40s]  I think people to move into the general, I think temporarily or new stuff. Let's see.
[5999.40s -> 6014.28s]  I need a sus hat. I don't need a sus hat. Why would I have a sus hat? I thought I was muted
[6014.28s -> 6023.11s]  when I just said that. Thanks a lot. That just, that makes it sound like that's all I talk about.
[6023.11s -> 6050.87s]  Oh no, Chad, there's no sus hat for me. Golden poop. Yeah. Early adopter hat too. This one looks
[6050.87s -> 6063.93s]  kind of cool. Only five bucks, right? For the expansion. The game's free. Yes. It's very,
[6063.93s -> 6068.79s]  very, very affordable for the kind of the word you get to play. Yeah. And you can also play it
[6068.79s -> 6075.38s]  on your phone if you have Android. Are you serious? Yeah. Oh, playing it on my phone. Oh my god.
[6075.94s -> 6084.02s]  I want, I have, I have iPhone, which sucks. Oh, you have an iPhone. Yeah. I want to play it.
[6086.98s -> 6096.39s]  I was going to switch to Android, but I just know Apple too. It's all I've used,
[6096.39s -> 6102.14s]  even though I don't like it. Yeah. I've also only used like Android, mostly except for like,
[6102.14s -> 6109.99s]  I don't know, like iPods and stuff. Yeah, iPad. It's funny because I was so against the Mac
[6109.99s -> 6116.63s]  computers. I was like, I'm never going to buy one of those overpriced pieces of shit. And then I
[6116.63s -> 6127.91s]  just bought all their other products. Okay. It says we can move to general. Okay. Okay. I want
[6127.91s -> 6150.94s]  to move over to general. Yeah. Good to do. GG's. GG. Good luck. I play among us on iOS. You guys
[6150.94s -> 6174.70s]  have fucking, okay. Yeah. Good luck. She, she was good. You're awkward. We're just have fucking
[6175.34s -> 6186.02s]  what are you talking about? You guys need to relax. Sounds good to me. All right. Uh, let's
[6186.02s -> 6192.44s]  get it started. You can just join semi-groups one. That's Psycho. No, I'm trying to think. No,
[6192.44s -> 6199.53s]  no. Excuse me. That's auto mango. No, it's Dan Ray. I'm looking reefer Dan Ray, your auto,
[6199.53s -> 6205.32s]  your group one, and then auto mango, your group two and auto, you just set it up and put the code
[6205.32s -> 6210.28s]  in general. Mango will join. Let me, let me just make sure I'm very clear. If I lost that last game,
[6210.28s -> 6215.06s]  that means I'm out of the tournament. It is single limb. Yeah. You're out from here. Okay.
[6215.06s -> 6219.86s]  Well, thanks for playing Jerma. I actually had a great time. It was like, actually it was like
[6219.86s -> 6227.70s]  really fun. It feels like a bit of a Jerma game. It's a great game. I love it. Some people have
[6227.70s -> 6234.86s]  called it the next battleship. I mean, I don't know if I'd go that far, but it's so addicting
[6234.86s -> 6239.34s]  to it's good battleship was pretty fun. It was really fun. Good gun here. Northern line. I mean,
[6239.34s -> 6245.16s]  it's not that big. All right, let's get it started. If you guys are, want to spectate,
[6245.16s -> 6251.08s]  or if you're like waiting, you can hop in just like mute. Okay. And so where, where do I go?
[6251.08s -> 6255.56s]  I go to Sammy's group one or number two. We're going to hold your match because we're just doing
[6255.56s -> 6259.08s]  two right now. I'll play for a little bit longer. I'm not going to end the screen. And then auto
[6259.08s -> 6264.92s]  mango. Oh, so I watch Ray's game. You just watch Ray's game. Yeah. Okay. Thanks for having me by
[6264.92s -> 6269.32s]  the way. Thanks Alex so much for playing brother. Yeah. I'll, I'll see you guys later. Bye guys.
[6269.32s -> 6277.13s]  Good luck to everybody else. All right, hop in, get it started. You two for you four. Uh,
[6277.13s -> 6282.55s]  and we're going to occasionally hop. Hmm. Yeah. Have a great time. Everybody. I wish everybody
[6282.55s -> 6286.39s]  really good luck on all the rest of the games for the rest of the day. And I will see you later.
[6286.39s -> 6308.02s]  It was a lot of fun. I was muted. Don't worry. I'm not a fucking weirdo. Yeah. The stream was
[6308.02s -> 6317.21s]  going to be small. That was fun. I look, I'm just, it was fun. What time is it? Yeah. This is going
[6317.53s -> 6323.98s]  to be a short stream. I'll play a couple of rounds. I am the sus guy by the way. No, I did. I did.
[6323.98s -> 6328.86s]  Okay. My biggest mistake with making like, um, just kind of like talk to small talk with it,
[6328.86s -> 6334.79s]  but just anybody is if I do like the funny voice, that's when it's like, okay, I gotta,
[6334.79s -> 6337.99s]  I gotta slow down. This is not like, this is not small talk anymore. I'm like, I'm,
[6337.99s -> 6344.87s]  I'm being like a funny guy. You know what I mean? Like, oh, the Mac, ah, piece of shit Macintosh.
[6344.87s -> 6360.42s]  Like I, that's slow down. That bit was so bad. I'm not even, it wasn't even making a bit. It was
[6360.42s -> 6380.47s]  just, you were so normal. I've told you guys this million times before. Okay. Like I, I,
[6380.47s -> 6386.95s]  we can be a weirdo in our own house, right? But we'll go to somebody else's house. If you get
[6386.95s -> 6393.82s]  invited to somebody else's house, you don't just grab a microphone in their home and just walk
[6393.82s -> 6399.70s]  around and just yell stuff. They're not prepared for that. They're not, they don't want to hear
[6399.70s -> 6406.47s]  that. You know what I mean? That's the quickest way to get disinvited to anything else in the
[6406.47s -> 6412.92s]  future is being in that general chat with like 15 people and being like, hey, once I picked
[6412.92s -> 6418.36s]  the beaver and, oh, that's kind of the, the beaver goes and makes that sound and then he goes na na na
[6418.36s -> 6422.84s]  na na na naas on the corn. And then I put the horse in there and they'd be like, all right,
[6422.84s -> 6426.52s]  Jeremy, we get fucking can you stop? Like, can you leave the call? Like, stop, we're trying to like
[6426.52s -> 6439.22s]  set this up. You can't be a weirdo in somebody. You could be a weirdo in your own home. Right.
[6439.22s -> 6454.82s]  You held that all in. I heard duck is bad, but that was fun though, that was really cool. You
[6454.82s -> 6458.57s]  You held, you were holding that in the whole time.
[6458.57s -> 6460.99s]  Host your own tournament where you're in charge.
[6460.99s -> 6462.25s]  Yeah, but that's the thing.
[6462.25s -> 6466.42s]  I could host a tournament and be in charge, but guess what?
[6466.42s -> 6467.94s]  When I send those invites out,
[6467.94s -> 6470.46s]  people are gonna know that I'm the one in charge,
[6470.46s -> 6471.30s]  and they're gonna be like,
[6471.30s -> 6478.13s]  I don't know if I wanna hear this dude nay like 20 times.
[6478.13s -> 6480.21s]  I might get, okay, I might get two people
[6480.21s -> 6481.41s]  to come to that party,
[6481.41s -> 6483.93s]  but it's people I don't necessarily want to be there.
[6483.93s -> 6486.13s]  You know what I'm saying?
[6486.13s -> 6488.45s]  Like, if you know like the weird guys having the party,
[6488.45s -> 6491.77s]  you might attract like the weird other guy,
[6491.77s -> 6495.14s]  and then you have to out weird that person.
[6495.14s -> 6507.06s]  It then becomes a competition between who's weirder.
[6507.06s -> 6510.74s]  No, all jokes aside, I wish them everybody else luck.
[6510.74s -> 6514.83s]  It was fun, I'm glad to have been invited.
[6514.83s -> 6516.70s]  It was very entertaining.
[6516.70s -> 6520.30s]  So now what's gonna happen is I'm gonna go pee,
[6520.30s -> 6521.46s]  and I'll be right back.
[6521.46s -> 6522.86s]  I'll play a couple more rounds,
[6522.86s -> 6524.02s]  and then I'm probably gonna stop
[6524.02s -> 6530.88s]  after like another 30 minutes, so I'll be right back.
[6530.88s -> 6871.40s]  We'll just chill.
[6871.40s -> 6872.24s]  All right, I'm back.
[6872.24s -> 6876.33s]  Sorry about that.
[6876.33s -> 6883.95s]  That was one of those really, really weird pees.
[6886.09s -> 6891.39s]  I was peeing, and it like felt like I still had to go.
[6891.39s -> 6895.07s]  Like I hadn't even gone yet, mid-pee.
[6895.07s -> 6900.67s]  You know what I'm saying?
[6900.67s -> 6902.77s]  Like after like a full 20 seconds,
[6902.77s -> 6907.46s]  it was like I still hadn't gone pee yet.
[6907.46s -> 6909.08s]  It was like, what's going on?
[6909.08s -> 6911.37s]  It was like at the brim for some reason.
[6911.37s -> 6914.08s]  No, I don't have a UTI.
[6914.08s -> 6918.90s]  And then it felt like it was going.
[6918.90s -> 6922.52s]  Okay, all right, let's do this a little bit.
[6922.52s -> 6924.31s]  We can take our time.
[6924.31s -> 6926.30s]  This game is actually pretty fun.
[6926.30s -> 6927.70s]  I don't think I'm gonna stream this again,
[6927.70s -> 6930.69s]  but I mean, I did say this is a short stream,
[6930.69s -> 6932.69s]  but I think two hours is too short,
[6932.69s -> 6937.30s]  and four hours is too long to be a short stream.
[6937.30s -> 6942.49s]  So let's see if we can round it out in the next 30 minutes.
[6942.49s -> 6945.26s]  Okay, the horse is, I don't like the horse very much.
[6945.26s -> 6947.00s]  I'm not joking, that's a UTI.
[6951.41s -> 6952.57s]  I'll be all right.
[6952.57s -> 6957.11s]  I don't have a UTI, okay?
[6957.11s -> 6962.15s]  A beaver is just good, early.
[6962.15s -> 6964.01s]  I keep hearing about this duck meta,
[6964.01s -> 6967.57s]  and I don't really wanna listen to it,
[6967.57s -> 6970.73s]  but I feel like give shop pets one-one.
[6970.73s -> 6975.93s]  Is that permanent?
[6975.93s -> 6978.94s]  Or is it only the pets that are down here in the shop?
[6978.94s -> 6984.42s]  Or is it a permanent thing to everybody?
[6984.42s -> 6986.89s]  Just those, huh.
[6986.89s -> 6989.90s]  I feel like that's not that good.
[6989.90s -> 6994.46s]  Maybe like really early, you just sell them immediately.
[6994.46s -> 6997.62s]  Like next round, just sell it.
[6997.62s -> 7003.02s]  I'll try it.
[7003.02s -> 7007.59s]  I don't want the horse though.
[7007.59s -> 7010.99s]  Here we go, okay.
[7010.99s -> 7018.50s]  I could do two beavers, and just buff somebody up.
[7018.50s -> 7021.78s]  Or fish is just a good, it's a two-three.
[7021.78s -> 7028.13s]  I'll go with fish.
[7028.13s -> 7032.93s]  All right, the confused teabags, the full scouts,
[7032.93s -> 7037.34s]  precious teabags, the precious bikers.
[7037.34s -> 7046.90s]  What about the precious teabags?
[7046.90s -> 7050.02s]  About buying bees?
[7050.06s -> 7051.90s]  I feel like early, the bees are really good.
[7051.90s -> 7053.32s]  And I wouldn't listen to anything I say,
[7053.32s -> 7057.89s]  because obviously I came in last place in the tournament.
[7057.89s -> 7068.27s]  But they just, they seem really useful.
[7068.27s -> 7071.76s]  Bee is ass most of the time.
[7071.76s -> 7079.20s]  Well, this is good, okay.
[7079.20s -> 7080.68s]  I feel like I know people are gonna,
[7080.68s -> 7082.06s]  people are telling me don't do bee,
[7082.06s -> 7083.76s]  but I'm gonna do the bee.
[7083.76s -> 7091.29s]  It's my strategy.
[7091.29s -> 7092.85s]  All right, do I just want a second two-three,
[7092.85s -> 7094.09s]  or should I get a cricket?
[7094.09s -> 7097.36s]  So that would be a one-one, maybe a second fish,
[7097.36s -> 7103.57s]  and I can combine them later.
[7103.57s -> 7108.04s]  That looks good.
[7108.04s -> 7111.14s]  Didn't I just buy?
[7111.14s -> 7112.94s]  You have a random friend, one-one.
[7112.94s -> 7121.62s]  That didn't happen.
[7121.62s -> 7126.86s]  Did it happen?
[7126.86s -> 7128.62s]  Happens when you buy the otter.
[7128.62s -> 7129.62s]  Only the otter?
[7129.62s -> 7133.21s]  Oh, I thought it was when you buy, oh, buy any, oh, okay.
[7133.21s -> 7139.30s]  Well, shit, all right, that's fine.
[7139.30s -> 7144.75s]  I think this is a winning team right now.
[7144.75s -> 7156.82s]  This looks like a win.
[7156.82s -> 7161.03s]  I'm convinced that you're me from another universe.
[7161.03s -> 7173.48s]  Not even a win, it's just a draw.
[7173.48s -> 7176.99s]  Only three-man, a one-one value is terrible.
[7176.99s -> 7185.39s]  Yeah, you're probably right.
[7185.39s -> 7190.42s]  No rat.
[7190.42s -> 7191.44s]  Ant is really good.
[7191.44s -> 7206.08s]  I think we combine fish and get ant.
[7206.08s -> 7211.32s]  I think you Leon for the 10 community subs, community subs.
[7211.32s -> 7212.32s]  Can we have a face cam?
[7212.32s -> 7213.92s]  No, I'm not kidding.
[7214.56s -> 7216.93s]  I don't have a t-shirt on.
[7216.93s -> 7219.05s]  I rolled out of bed and turned on the stream
[7219.05s -> 7221.12s]  like 30 minutes later.
[7221.12s -> 7225.83s]  I was up all night studying.
[7225.83s -> 7231.84s]  Do I just buff this guy up like crazy to make sure I win?
[7231.84s -> 7241.48s]  Well, that's easy.
[7241.48s -> 7244.56s]  I think I sell the duck next turn.
[7244.56s -> 7252.95s]  If there's a fish, I sell duck.
[7252.95s -> 7254.27s]  You sound tired.
[7254.27s -> 7256.07s]  Well, this is okay, so for everybody that's asking,
[7256.07s -> 7258.19s]  how come, dude, come on, how come you don't start
[7258.19s -> 7260.39s]  at like 10, 11 o'clock in the morning?
[7260.39s -> 7261.95s]  More people would be able to watch your streams.
[7261.95s -> 7264.24s]  What about EU?
[7264.24s -> 7265.92s]  I cannot function before noon.
[7265.92s -> 7267.04s]  I can't.
[7267.04s -> 7268.80s]  Even if I wake up at eight o'clock in the morning,
[7268.84s -> 7269.68s]  doesn't matter.
[7269.68s -> 7274.54s]  I don't function until at least one, two or three p.m.
[7274.54s -> 7275.58s]  Doesn't matter when I go to sleep.
[7275.58s -> 7278.88s]  Doesn't matter when I wake up.
[7278.88s -> 7281.00s]  So reliably getting up in the morning
[7281.00s -> 7284.58s]  and doing a live stream at 10 o'clock,
[7284.58s -> 7287.73s]  11 o'clock in the morning, which means that, okay,
[7287.73s -> 7291.63s]  so that means I have to get up around eight or nine, right?
[7291.63s -> 7294.15s]  So get up at eight a.m. and I'm just not a morning person.
[7294.15s -> 7296.95s]  I've tried a million times.
[7296.95s -> 7299.85s]  It's not gonna happen.
[7299.85s -> 7302.57s]  All right, well, let's do this.
[7302.57s -> 7305.70s]  Hold on.
[7305.70s -> 7311.08s]  I don't want to do this to the duck.
[7311.12s -> 7313.53s]  Oh, God damn it.
[7313.53s -> 7322.82s]  Can I do a second, should I do level two duck?
[7322.82s -> 7324.66s]  Is duck bad?
[7324.66s -> 7327.13s]  Should I just not do duck?
[7327.13s -> 7329.95s]  Oh, what else we got?
[7329.95s -> 7330.79s]  I like swan.
[7330.79s -> 7334.32s]  All right, I'm selling duck and I'm getting swan.
[7334.32s -> 7338.79s]  Here we go.
[7338.79s -> 7339.87s]  Nice.
[7339.87s -> 7345.92s]  Here comes the swan and then here comes otter.
[7345.92s -> 7347.64s]  Not bad.
[7347.64s -> 7349.79s]  Shrimp.
[7349.79s -> 7354.51s]  When you sell a friend, give somebody random one health.
[7354.51s -> 7360.11s]  This is the only other thing I'd be selling.
[7360.11s -> 7364.17s]  Although I could just, okay,
[7364.17s -> 7366.45s]  I could kill the ant, give the buff to somebody
[7366.45s -> 7368.63s]  and put the shrimp up there.
[7368.63s -> 7373.78s]  Because then I'm gonna end up selling the beaver.
[7376.99s -> 7378.75s]  I think that's not a bad idea.
[7378.75s -> 7379.59s]  Because if I kill the ant,
[7379.59s -> 7382.87s]  he'll give the two one to somebody back here
[7382.87s -> 7383.93s]  and then I can put the shrimp up.
[7383.93s -> 7386.24s]  It's the same stats.
[7386.24s -> 7388.60s]  And then eventually I'll get the one health
[7388.60s -> 7390.84s]  for selling the beaver.
[7390.84s -> 7395.41s]  Shrimp sucks though.
[7395.41s -> 7399.70s]  I'm gonna go for it, okay?
[7399.70s -> 7402.60s]  I mean, this is gonna be the beefy guy.
[7402.60s -> 7403.81s]  What?
[7403.81s -> 7405.01s]  Oh, it doesn't sell it.
[7405.01s -> 7406.53s]  It just deletes it.
[7406.53s -> 7407.87s]  Oh, no.
[7407.87s -> 7408.71s]  Oh, no.
[7408.71s -> 7409.83s]  It just deletes it.
[7409.83s -> 7412.26s]  I thought it sold it too.
[7412.26s -> 7417.03s]  Oh, okay.
[7417.03s -> 7421.17s]  I thought I was gonna get one gold.
[7421.17s -> 7422.01s]  Shit.
[7422.01s -> 7423.29s]  No, well, that plan is gone.
[7423.29s -> 7426.62s]  No, what's the reason to just roll the shrimp?
[7426.62s -> 7429.81s]  Oh, fuck.
[7429.81s -> 7430.93s]  And you can control Z?
[7430.93s -> 7440.08s]  No, you can't.
[7440.08s -> 7443.20s]  Copy the health from the friend in front.
[7443.20s -> 7444.04s]  Damn it.
[7444.04s -> 7448.75s]  Oh, that's not good.
[7448.75s -> 7449.99s]  I like the peacock.
[7449.99s -> 7453.48s]  Maybe I'll hold onto the peacock.
[7453.48s -> 7455.24s]  Shit.
[7455.24s -> 7463.55s]  Well, did you get a spider?
[7463.55s -> 7467.68s]  I actually might not lose this.
[7467.68s -> 7469.16s]  I only have four as well.
[7469.16s -> 7472.40s]  I might actually win this.
[7472.40s -> 7478.70s]  Yeah, okay.
[7478.70s -> 7479.54s]  Is this a bot?
[7479.54s -> 7482.45s]  No.
[7482.45s -> 7485.77s]  Please make a joke or do a bit.
[7485.77s -> 7486.81s]  I don't think I need to do that
[7486.81s -> 7488.55s]  considering the first two hours of the stream
[7488.55s -> 7491.81s]  was like a joke.
[7492.81s -> 7495.49s]  Honestly, that whole tournament really did feel
[7495.49s -> 7500.53s]  like I was in a Mr. Bean movie, just in a video game.
[7500.53s -> 7502.57s]  I just was sitting there.
[7502.57s -> 7504.05s]  I made every single mistake.
[7504.05s -> 7505.47s]  I didn't know there was a timer.
[7505.47s -> 7511.13s]  I fucked up the first like three turns.
[7511.13s -> 7514.39s]  I'm playing checkers while somebody else is playing chess.
[7514.39s -> 7517.27s]  I'm trying to stay in the lines in the coloring book
[7517.27s -> 7521.53s]  and they're playing with chess.
[7521.53s -> 7524.29s]  I was not, I got thrown off so bad.
[7524.29s -> 7526.05s]  Sheep is really good.
[7526.05s -> 7529.02s]  We're gonna do sheep.
[7529.02s -> 7531.71s]  Wait, hold on.
[7531.71s -> 7533.43s]  Sell, give two friends one one.
[7533.43s -> 7535.75s]  All right, we're gonna buy the sheep.
[7535.75s -> 7541.25s]  We're gonna do the fish.
[7541.25s -> 7543.64s]  This would be really good.
[7543.64s -> 7548.45s]  Squirrel, buy, clear and fill.
[7548.45s -> 7551.72s]  She clears everything and fills the shop with food.
[7551.72s -> 7556.53s]  Interesting, okay.
[7556.53s -> 7560.16s]  All right, so now that I have a second,
[7560.16s -> 7562.12s]  like I can barely kind of explain to people
[7562.12s -> 7564.88s]  like what is even going on, I have no idea.
[7564.88s -> 7568.08s]  So this game is kind of like auto chess
[7568.08s -> 7569.78s]  or like Hearthstone Battlegrounds
[7569.78s -> 7572.61s]  or whatever other auto battler.
[7572.61s -> 7575.03s]  You have a set of 10 gold at the end
[7575.03s -> 7577.27s]  of the beginning of every round,
[7577.27s -> 7580.05s]  which everything costs three gold.
[7581.01s -> 7583.37s]  It's three gold for me to buy this.
[7583.37s -> 7588.96s]  I get 10 gold every round and your goal is to try to,
[7588.96s -> 7591.92s]  they all have little things, they're like little perks
[7591.92s -> 7593.76s]  and little, if this, then why?
[7593.76s -> 7595.87s]  If X, then why?
[7595.87s -> 7597.95s]  And you have to try to build up a team eventually
[7597.95s -> 7602.38s]  that's strong enough to take you to the end.
[7602.38s -> 7604.92s]  They fight on their own just by in order,
[7604.92s -> 7606.18s]  one, two, three, four, five.
[7606.18s -> 7608.94s]  You can only have five and there's no undo
[7608.94s -> 7611.50s]  and you're playing against other players.
[7611.50s -> 7613.74s]  Is this like team fight tactics?
[7613.74s -> 7615.16s]  I've never played team fight tactics,
[7615.16s -> 7618.88s]  but I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes.
[7618.88s -> 7621.19s]  It's like a StarCraft custom map.
[7621.19s -> 7623.45s]  Yes, but I don't know if I should buy the squirrel.
[7623.45s -> 7626.44s]  Is it time to buy squirrel and just feed somebody?
[7626.44s -> 7628.65s]  I don't think so.
[7628.65s -> 7635.89s]  What about the peacock?
[7635.89s -> 7636.73s]  Hope you're doing great.
[7636.73s -> 7640.67s]  I'm doing pretty good, I am.
[7640.67s -> 7648.06s]  I think I just re-roll the whole thing.
[7648.06s -> 7650.96s]  All right, now we're talking.
[7650.96s -> 7653.76s]  Now we're talking, now we've got some synergy.
[7653.76s -> 7657.55s]  So the whale swallows something at the beginning of battle,
[7657.55s -> 7659.84s]  which is technically killing it.
[7659.84s -> 7663.08s]  And then after the whale dies, it spits it out
[7663.08s -> 7664.80s]  and it gets to come back as a level one.
[7664.80s -> 7667.24s]  So look at that, we have a sheep.
[7667.24s -> 7670.74s]  It's going to eat the sheep and summon two rams.
[7670.74s -> 7673.92s]  And then when the whale dies, it gets to happen again.
[7673.92s -> 7676.67s]  Now we need somebody, we need the dog.
[7676.67s -> 7680.40s]  All right, this whole thing has to be redone,
[7680.40s -> 7682.89s]  this whole thing.
[7682.89s -> 7686.97s]  So I need to get rid of this, everybody pretty much.
[7686.97s -> 7689.07s]  Let's get rid of the beaver.
[7689.07s -> 7692.54s]  I get it in the right order.
[7692.54s -> 7696.14s]  Oh, fish can go, fish, can I buy everybody with the,
[7696.14s -> 7698.08s]  let's see, this is two gold, four, five, six.
[7698.08s -> 7706.08s]  Okay, I can afford both.
[7706.08s -> 7710.59s]  I think the fish, if the fish goes,
[7710.59s -> 7713.49s]  which then allows me to get the,
[7713.53s -> 7715.52s]  all right, I have to buy the dog first.
[7715.52s -> 7730.80s]  So maybe the swan, replace the swan or replace the otter.
[7730.80s -> 7736.07s]  Cause the beaver, I mean, five, five versus six, six,
[7736.07s -> 7738.40s]  get rid of the otter first.
[7738.40s -> 7739.88s]  Yeah, cause then I'm going to do,
[7739.88s -> 7742.89s]  okay, we'll get rid of otter.
[7742.89s -> 7746.83s]  Now the dog goes up.
[7746.83s -> 7748.89s]  Okay, and now the whale comes up,
[7748.89s -> 7753.21s]  which will get a benefit from the dog.
[7753.21s -> 7758.42s]  There we go.
[7758.42s -> 7759.94s]  So I have to make sure this is going to,
[7759.94s -> 7763.69s]  so I have to do this, right?
[7763.69s -> 7766.09s]  Cause technically you can only have five people up.
[7766.09s -> 7771.09s]  So I don't want to have to just be wasted.
[7771.09s -> 7772.73s]  Oh, wait a minute, fuck.
[7775.38s -> 7779.31s]  Oh wait, this is wrong.
[7779.31s -> 7781.04s]  This is wrong.
[7781.04s -> 7783.49s]  He does it at the start of the fight.
[7783.49s -> 7789.04s]  So he's going to just spit out a two, two ram.
[7789.04s -> 7792.73s]  Oh, oh well.
[7792.73s -> 7795.76s]  I think it's still going to be all right.
[7795.76s -> 7798.01s]  Okay, well we'll do it like this.
[7798.01s -> 7806.92s]  Dog is going to start getting buffed.
[7811.21s -> 7814.91s]  Okay, well we'll see how it goes.
[7814.91s -> 7817.44s]  Still greater in the numbers game, that's true.
[7817.44s -> 7818.28s]  This game's really fun.
[7818.28s -> 7819.90s]  I'm probably not going to play this that much on stream,
[7819.90s -> 7822.82s]  but when I saw Liberty play this,
[7822.82s -> 7827.12s]  I was like, that looks cute.
[7827.12s -> 7827.96s]  All right, so there it is.
[7827.96s -> 7828.88s]  Is he going to get the buff?
[7828.88s -> 7838.35s]  Yep.
[7838.35s -> 7839.17s]  Where's my second?
[7839.17s -> 7840.01s]  Oh, okay, I was like, what?
[7843.24s -> 7845.40s]  The dog is just a huge pain in the ass if you have summons,
[7845.40s -> 7851.20s]  but I didn't make it.
[7851.20s -> 7852.16s]  You know, he can speed it up.
[7852.16s -> 7857.54s]  Yeah, but I like to watch.
[7857.54s -> 7861.92s]  Another swan.
[7861.92s -> 7863.52s]  I could put this guy behind.
[7863.52s -> 7878.94s]  Hmm, money on the dog.
[7878.94s -> 7884.03s]  Might be time to sell a beaver.
[7884.03s -> 7886.92s]  All right, I think I'm going to sell beaver,
[7886.92s -> 7893.42s]  upgrade swan, sneeze directly into the microphone.
[7893.42s -> 7894.26s]  Ah!
[7898.72s -> 7906.98s]  After that, probably, did I even freeze the turtle?
[7906.98s -> 7908.34s]  Well, I know I'm doing this,
[7908.34s -> 7910.25s]  but I don't want to, hold on.
[7910.25s -> 7913.52s]  Let's do this first.
[7913.52s -> 7914.78s]  The dog gets a benefit from this,
[7914.78s -> 7925.94s]  so it has to be on the swan, maybe.
[7925.94s -> 7928.17s]  Okay, good.
[7928.17s -> 7934.93s]  Now, this can really start to stack up,
[7934.93s -> 7938.08s]  especially behind here or behind him.
[7938.08s -> 7940.24s]  Ox behind whale,
[7940.24s -> 7942.08s]  because anytime somebody ahead of the ox dies,
[7942.08s -> 7948.54s]  he gets a divine shield and two attack.
[7948.54s -> 7952.25s]  I feel like that's really good.
[7952.25s -> 7957.82s]  Or should I not do that and try to find more summons?
[7957.82s -> 7960.14s]  It only applies to the person directly in front of them.
[7960.14s -> 7966.05s]  Oh, that's right.
[7966.05s -> 7976.49s]  Swan will, I think behind here.
[7976.49s -> 7977.41s]  I'm going to, let me, hold on.
[7977.41s -> 7978.37s]  Let me see if there's anything else.
[7978.37s -> 7982.48s]  I know I'm doing this.
[7982.48s -> 7983.68s]  Just a constant stream of money,
[7983.68s -> 7987.56s]  especially if it's too gold around, that's a big deal.
[7987.56s -> 7988.76s]  Let me freeze this.
[7988.76s -> 7993.71s]  Let's just go for something else.
[7993.71s -> 7998.83s]  I don't know if I even want the turtle.
[7998.83s -> 7999.83s]  Ox and salad.
[7999.83s -> 8011.95s]  Yeah, it's too late.
[8011.95s -> 8017.57s]  Let's try this.
[8017.57s -> 8020.19s]  Let's see if this works.
[8020.19s -> 8023.86s]  Herman hates Elden Ring.
[8023.86s -> 8024.88s]  I was going to just go off
[8024.88s -> 8026.24s]  and I'm going to fake elaborate story
[8026.24s -> 8027.64s]  of why I think it's the worst souls game,
[8027.64s -> 8040.72s]  but why would I do that?
[8040.72s -> 8042.26s]  Okay, here we go.
[8042.26s -> 8044.71s]  This is where this makes sense here.
[8044.71s -> 8048.42s]  He dies, so he's going to get the buff.
[8048.42s -> 8051.32s]  This sheep dies, two sheep come out.
[8051.32s -> 8054.66s]  Perfect.
[8054.66s -> 8055.54s]  Yeah, all right.
[8055.54s -> 8056.36s]  This is going to work out,
[8056.36s -> 8060.63s]  as long as I level them up and beef them up a little bit.
[8060.67s -> 8066.03s]  I think he might have better stuff though.
[8066.03s -> 8068.05s]  I'll kill the first two.
[8068.05s -> 8069.50s]  No, this is a win.
[8069.50s -> 8070.56s]  Shit, no, it's not.
[8070.56s -> 8072.68s]  Damn it, come on.
[8072.68s -> 8074.24s]  He had garlic armor on.
[8074.24s -> 8087.68s]  Ah, no, it's still, it's a draw.
[8087.68s -> 8094.05s]  Ooh, monkey is so good.
[8094.05s -> 8096.97s]  Give the rightmost friend two, two every time you,
[8096.97s -> 8103.62s]  and every time you like go to a battle.
[8103.62s -> 8112.32s]  I think it's time to get rid of the, I don't know.
[8112.32s -> 8113.16s]  Who does this replace?
[8113.16s -> 8115.52s]  The dog?
[8115.52s -> 8124.12s]  The dog's kind of fallen off, or the swan maybe.
[8124.12s -> 8124.96s]  What does the one for do?
[8124.96s -> 8126.48s]  So every time some,
[8126.48s -> 8129.52s]  the character directly in front of the ox,
[8129.52s -> 8134.60s]  when it dies, he gets plus two attack and melon armor,
[8134.60s -> 8137.52s]  which means you can take at least 20 damage one time.
[8137.52s -> 8144.72s]  It's like a shield, like divine shield.
[8144.72s -> 8146.51s]  We need to buff this guy.
[8146.51s -> 8147.35s]  All right, let's see.
[8147.35s -> 8150.80s]  Okay, we're going to make a decision based on this.
[8150.80s -> 8151.64s]  All right, nice.
[8151.64s -> 8155.06s]  That's exactly what I wanted.
[8155.06s -> 8163.52s]  I think it's time to get rid of this one.
[8163.52s -> 8167.09s]  Yeah.
[8176.30s -> 8187.47s]  Okay, now I need garlic armor or something.
[8187.47s -> 8189.22s]  Ooh, ooh, here we go.
[8189.22s -> 8191.58s]  Okay.
[8191.58s -> 8193.28s]  The hippo is actually really good.
[8193.28s -> 8194.50s]  When you, if you kill somebody with the hippo,
[8194.50s -> 8195.34s]  you just get two, two.
[8195.34s -> 8196.50s]  You just keep doing over and over and over
[8196.50s -> 8202.16s]  and over and over again.
[8202.16s -> 8206.44s]  Monkey buff's going to get wasted on the sheep.
[8206.44s -> 8215.80s]  Should I have the monkey just give it to himself?
[8215.80s -> 8225.34s]  Cause I want the hippo eventually to be here.
[8225.34s -> 8227.26s]  I think we, I think I'm actually just probably
[8227.26s -> 8238.26s]  going to get rid of the sheep and the dog maybe.
[8238.26s -> 8242.10s]  Well, let's just roll.
[8242.10s -> 8245.70s]  Yeah, I mean, the dog is good.
[8245.70s -> 8247.02s]  It's the ox for the hippo.
[8247.02s -> 8249.37s]  Yeah, that's probably the play.
[8249.37s -> 8260.70s]  We'll do that next time.
[8260.70s -> 8262.22s]  Cause I want the monkey to buff the hippo.
[8262.22s -> 8264.59s]  Oh my God, I'm going to lose.
[8264.59s -> 8265.55s]  Holy fucking shit.
[8265.55s -> 8277.13s]  Are you kidding me?
[8277.13s -> 8287.02s]  This is a disaster.
[8287.02s -> 8290.90s]  What episode of the let's play is this?
[8290.90s -> 8299.14s]  I don't know, 200?
[8299.14s -> 8301.73s]  What's the title mean?
[8302.57s -> 8303.41s]  What does it say?
[8303.41s -> 8305.45s]  Oh, free space bingo perspective.
[8305.45s -> 8307.37s]  Yeah, but that means I'm the free space.
[8307.37s -> 8309.57s]  Whoever is playing against me in the tournament,
[8309.57s -> 8311.43s]  I'm the free space.
[8311.43s -> 8315.34s]  Like you're just pretty much guaranteed to win.
[8315.34s -> 8316.18s]  All right, let me get this right.
[8316.18s -> 8318.89s]  We're going dog.
[8318.89s -> 8320.09s]  I'm keeping the dog.
[8320.09s -> 8324.10s]  Getting rid of the ox, right?
[8324.10s -> 8325.22s]  Yes, yes.
[8325.22s -> 8327.82s]  Get rid of the ox.
[8327.82s -> 8332.11s]  Hippo going in front.
[8332.11s -> 8340.63s]  And then we're going to garlic the hippo.
[8340.63s -> 8346.74s]  And then we're going to go like this.
[8346.74s -> 8348.50s]  And that's a leveled up dog.
[8348.50s -> 8349.89s]  Next round.
[8349.93s -> 8351.42s]  Oh wait, I have to live.
[8351.42s -> 8355.09s]  I actually have to survive otherwise.
[8355.09s -> 8362.16s]  Why are you commentating like it's a grand strategy?
[8362.16s -> 8363.77s]  You know what?
[8363.77s -> 8366.10s]  I'm a nice guy.
[8366.10s -> 8368.74s]  I'm a nice person.
[8368.74s -> 8370.95s]  But when somebody comes in here
[8370.95s -> 8372.39s]  and I'm a good guy, right?
[8372.39s -> 8374.18s]  I'm a nice guy.
[8374.18s -> 8377.37s]  But if you come in and just kind of talk shit to me,
[8377.37s -> 8378.93s]  nice guy drops.
[8378.93s -> 8381.41s]  And then you will watch out, here comes the mad guy.
[8381.41s -> 8382.85s]  Here comes, you know what I mean?
[8382.85s -> 8395.04s]  Like I'm a good guy, I'm a nice guy.
[8395.04s -> 8395.88s]  Do I want to say anything else?
[8395.88s -> 8398.92s]  No, roll.
[8398.92s -> 8400.60s]  All right, come on, please survive this round.
[8400.60s -> 8405.62s]  Come on Hippo, please survive.
[8405.62s -> 8406.90s]  I don't think the hippo is going to survive.
[8406.90s -> 8408.90s]  Maybe because of the two, two.
[8408.90s -> 8416.81s]  Look, this is going to take off if I live the next round.
[8416.81s -> 8424.46s]  Okay, come on, let's go.
[8424.46s -> 8426.10s]  Don't get on my bad side.
[8426.10s -> 8427.46s]  Yeah, look, chat.
[8427.46s -> 8429.49s]  I'm a nice guy.
[8429.49s -> 8431.29s]  But don't like, you know, you get me riled up
[8431.29s -> 8432.25s]  and you get me pissed off.
[8432.25s -> 8434.45s]  Like, you know, don't get me fucking mad and everything.
[8434.45s -> 8435.29s]  You know what I mean?
[8435.29s -> 8436.28s]  I'm a nice guy.
[8436.28s -> 8437.12s]  I'm nice to people.
[8437.12s -> 8437.96s]  I'm not a fucking dick.
[8437.96s -> 8438.78s]  I'm not a bad guy.
[8438.78s -> 8441.34s]  I'm a nice person.
[8441.34s -> 8445.68s]  I actually might survive.
[8445.68s -> 8451.33s]  Oh, no, come on.
[8451.33s -> 8456.41s]  No, I don't live.
[8456.41s -> 8458.45s]  He's got a 21, 16 dog.
[8459.13s -> 8460.05s]  Dog's level two.
[8460.05s -> 8463.49s]  God damn it.
[8463.49s -> 8473.40s]  Oh well.
[8473.40s -> 8474.92s]  No, I'm a nice person.
[8474.92s -> 8475.76s]  Okay.
[8475.76s -> 8487.62s]  I do nice things for people.
[8487.62s -> 8489.31s]  It's like, okay.
[8489.31s -> 8490.13s]  All right.
[8490.13s -> 8491.90s]  So what's your point?
[8491.90s -> 8502.62s]  What are you talking about?
[8502.62s -> 8504.06s]  You're doing an extended bit here.
[8504.06s -> 8509.81s]  This is not a bit.
[8509.81s -> 8511.09s]  All right, parasocial Andy.
[8511.09s -> 8512.77s]  Don't let it get under your skin.
[8512.77s -> 8514.68s]  How dare you?
[8514.68s -> 8519.03s]  How dare you say something like that to me?
[8519.03s -> 8522.25s]  You're lucky I'm a fucking nice guy, okay.
[8522.25s -> 8523.97s]  I, how did I lose the first round?
[8523.97s -> 8538.55s]  What?
[8543.66s -> 8544.80s]  Oh, God damn it.
[8544.80s -> 8548.32s]  I need to, okay.
[8548.32s -> 8555.79s]  I'm just gonna, I'm being a weirdo.
[8555.79s -> 8561.26s]  This should work.
[8561.26s -> 8564.46s]  Do I level up one of these two or do I just feed someone?
[8564.46s -> 8585.59s]  Probably just level up the beaver.
[8585.59s -> 8587.07s]  Come on.
[8587.07s -> 8599.12s]  No, I think I still, yeah, I still got it.
[8599.12s -> 8599.96s]  Are you this bad?
[8599.96s -> 8607.46s]  I just won the match.
[8607.46s -> 8609.22s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[8609.22s -> 8614.26s]  No, I don't want the dog.
[8614.26s -> 8616.74s]  Do I kill ant?
[8616.74s -> 8622.51s]  Maybe.
[8622.51s -> 8624.52s]  Oh God, okay.
[8624.52s -> 8630.02s]  So the play here is I'm gonna make a level three ant,
[8630.02s -> 8635.88s]  sell this ant, like just get the,
[8635.88s -> 8639.92s]  okay, let's combine the ant, one of them,
[8639.92s -> 8643.82s]  get another one.
[8643.82s -> 8645.78s]  Ooh, yeah, all right.
[8645.78s -> 8648.87s]  That's really good.
[8648.87s -> 8652.21s]  Play kangaroo, kill ant,
[8652.21s -> 8655.06s]  or play kangaroo, kill ant next turn
[8655.06s -> 8674.28s]  and give food to kangaroo.
[8674.28s -> 8678.42s]  Yeah, I'll do it next turn.
[8678.42s -> 8681.72s]  No, I, no, whoa.
[8681.72s -> 8683.54s]  No, I wanted to move him.
[8683.54s -> 8685.94s]  I wanted to move him to the front.
[8685.94s -> 8688.20s]  I wanted to move him to the front.
[8688.20s -> 8693.06s]  Oh, yeah.
[8693.06s -> 8694.52s]  I want, whatever.
[8694.52s -> 8695.40s]  Come on.
[8695.76s -> 8701.65s]  I was trying to move him.
[8701.65s -> 8708.45s]  I think I'm all right.
[8708.45s -> 8720.58s]  That's a crock of shit right there if I've ever seen one.
[8720.58s -> 8725.09s]  Oh my God, he got melon armor.
[8725.09s -> 8729.69s]  That just made you win unironically.
[8729.69s -> 8730.85s]  Oh, look, it doesn't even matter
[8730.85s -> 8734.26s]  because I can just buy this and kill it.
[8734.26s -> 8741.30s]  We're not doing that right now though, hold on.
[8741.30s -> 8746.92s]  Ah, interesting.
[8746.92s -> 8748.60s]  Come on, the worst one,
[8748.60s -> 8752.10s]  the worst tier three pet that you could have given me.
[8752.10s -> 8754.31s]  The worst one.
[8754.31s -> 8757.51s]  All right, I'm a nice guy.
[8757.51s -> 8759.67s]  But when I see shit like this that I don't like,
[8759.67s -> 8762.11s]  it really, it gets me fucking a little pissed off
[8762.47s -> 8764.89s]  and it makes me, I'll talk about it for a little while.
[8764.89s -> 8766.17s]  I hate to say this kind of shit
[8766.17s -> 8767.45s]  to somebody that like, I like to call myself
[8767.45s -> 8783.28s]  like a good person, but everybody hates me.
[8783.28s -> 8784.79s]  No, these suck.
[8784.79s -> 8794.16s]  I can't use the dog right now.
[8794.16s -> 8796.88s]  Oh, listen, he's a nice guy.
[8796.88s -> 8801.64s]  There we go, dodo, freeze.
[8801.64s -> 8809.20s]  Nice guys can get pissed off too, relax.
[8809.20s -> 8811.80s]  Because of boomer rant?
[8811.80s -> 8814.70s]  What do you, what?
[8814.70s -> 8817.90s]  Dodo, guys, I'm gonna sell the beaver
[8817.90s -> 8821.70s]  and the dodo is gonna get extra points.
[8821.70s -> 8823.81s]  That's a swan meadow, look at that.
[8823.81s -> 8830.16s]  Wow, I didn't even know how you did this.
[8830.20s -> 8838.38s]  Like how?
[8838.38s -> 8840.26s]  I think that's a win it is.
[8852.96s -> 8855.65s]  Okay, if I sell, oh shit.
[8855.65s -> 8859.21s]  Okay, it's random friends up here.
[8859.21s -> 8861.45s]  All right, this is where we do the thing that I wanted to do.
[8861.45s -> 8865.14s]  We're gonna sell, we're gonna kill the ant.
[8865.14s -> 8866.14s]  Give it to the kangaroo.
[8876.05s -> 8877.25s]  Mosquito is worthless now too.
[8877.25s -> 8879.48s]  All right, who do I replace?
[8879.48s -> 8880.88s]  I know I got to buff up the dodo.
[8880.88s -> 8883.92s]  So we're definitely gonna buy the dodo.
[8883.92s -> 8886.17s]  And I'm just gonna do this too.
[8886.17s -> 8888.65s]  Wait, no, hold on.
[8888.65s -> 8896.94s]  Get rid of the mosquito for maybe even the beaver.
[8896.94s -> 8898.42s]  The giraffe will buff the dodo.
[8899.26s -> 8904.76s]  Okay, let's do that.
[8904.76s -> 8905.60s]  The giraffe is gonna buff the dodo
[8905.60s -> 8908.55s]  who in turn is gonna buff the kangaroo
[8908.55s -> 8914.70s]  who in turn is going to, all right, that's fine.
[8914.70s -> 8920.67s]  I think everyone needs to move up a little bit though.
[8920.67s -> 8926.92s]  In turn, give one start of battle, give it to, okay.
[8926.92s -> 8930.74s]  And I'm gonna do this.
[8930.74s -> 8932.00s]  That's what I would like to call a pogchamp.
[8932.00s -> 8933.76s]  But if I don't see at least 500 pogchamps
[8933.76s -> 8936.66s]  in the chat right now, I'm gonna scream.
[8936.66s -> 8939.50s]  This is loud as I fucking can.
[8939.50s -> 8940.58s]  Sell the fucking beaver.
[8940.58s -> 8955.40s]  Next round, boom, boom.
[8955.40s -> 8956.52s]  Oh, this person has a background.
[8956.52s -> 8965.07s]  I know what they're doing.
[8965.07s -> 8968.32s]  All right, come on.
[8968.32s -> 8969.32s]  Not bad so far.
[8969.32s -> 8972.06s]  This dog is really scary.
[8972.06s -> 8975.37s]  I'll make it to the dog.
[8975.37s -> 8983.67s]  All right, we're good.
[8983.67s -> 8985.65s]  Very nice.
[8985.65s -> 8986.85s]  Okay, I gotta do this in the right order.
[8986.85s -> 8990.68s]  Sell the beaver.
[8990.68s -> 8991.64s]  Don't sell the beaver yet
[8991.64s -> 8998.44s]  because I need to give garlic to the kangaroo.
[8998.44s -> 9005.12s]  And that means now I can sell the beaver,
[9005.12s -> 9006.72s]  which will give two health to two people.
[9006.72s -> 9014.64s]  I'm really hoping it hits the kangaroo.
[9014.64s -> 9015.46s]  That's perfect.
[9015.46s -> 9018.75s]  That's almost precisely what I wanted.
[9018.75s -> 9021.75s]  Rabbit now, if a friend eats a shop food,
[9021.75s -> 9027.70s]  they get plus one health.
[9027.70s -> 9033.11s]  I wonder, that's probably good.
[9033.11s -> 9034.59s]  I need to feed somebody something.
[9034.59s -> 9036.03s]  I'm gonna feed the dodo the garlic
[9036.03s -> 9040.22s]  and that should be plus one health as well.
[9040.22s -> 9046.26s]  Let me try to get some.
[9046.26s -> 9047.62s]  All right, I have to do this
[9047.62s -> 9054.15s]  because it's a sure thing.
[9054.15s -> 9055.03s]  Okay, good.
[9055.03s -> 9059.13s]  Freeze that.
[9059.13s -> 9061.49s]  Get another roll.
[9061.49s -> 9062.73s]  That's another bunny.
[9062.73s -> 9064.01s]  And I'm gonna freeze the snail too
[9064.01s -> 9067.02s]  because if I lose the next battle,
[9067.02s -> 9068.54s]  then I just have to put him up there
[9068.54s -> 9069.90s]  and he gives two, one to everybody
[9069.90s -> 9071.64s]  and then you just sell them.
[9071.64s -> 9074.58s]  All right, this is looking good.
[9074.58s -> 9075.40s]  All right, let's go.
[9075.40s -> 9081.22s]  I think this should be all right.
[9081.22s -> 9086.96s]  Is this the guy that wore the snuggie?
[9086.96s -> 9090.21s]  This is a loss probably, we'll see.
[9090.21s -> 9096.42s]  Garlic armor is on the crabs.
[9096.42s -> 9099.10s]  Although I think the kangaroo is gonna carry.
[9099.10s -> 9100.90s]  Yep, that's a kangaroo carry right there.
[9100.90s -> 9103.00s]  Bingo.
[9103.00s -> 9105.10s]  Do I have enough to kill the next two?
[9105.10s -> 9108.62s]  Yeah.
[9108.62s -> 9109.48s]  Oh shit.
[9109.48s -> 9120.93s]  That was actually closer than it could, wow.
[9120.93s -> 9121.77s]  I won that.
[9121.77s -> 9131.72s]  So unfortunately, I'm gonna hold on to the snail though.
[9131.72s -> 9134.27s]  Give me another bunny.
[9134.27s -> 9136.51s]  Okay, so if somebody eats food, they get plus one.
[9136.51s -> 9139.43s]  So this is just gonna give them two people plus one plus one.
[9139.43s -> 9143.30s]  So it's gonna be just doubled up on the health.
[9143.30s -> 9145.46s]  Oh, oh my God, couldn't have been better than that.
[9145.46s -> 9150.48s]  You could not have even given me a better one.
[9150.56s -> 9151.40s]  What do you think?
[9151.40s -> 9154.05s]  Should I just get the ant, level up the ant?
[9154.05s -> 9154.93s]  What's my favorite soda?
[9154.93s -> 9163.86s]  It varies, seven up.
[9163.86s -> 9168.10s]  And then roll it.
[9168.10s -> 9170.54s]  All right, so in case I lose, I have an opportunity here.
[9170.54s -> 9176.16s]  So I think this is gonna start to stack.
[9176.16s -> 9181.28s]  Kill the dodo, why would I do that?
[9181.28s -> 9193.89s]  That's a level three ant, which is awesome.
[9193.89s -> 9195.05s]  Watching any new shows?
[9195.05s -> 9203.40s]  Not really, not really.
[9203.40s -> 9204.92s]  Give it to the kangaroo.
[9204.92s -> 9211.03s]  Ah, it's all right, spread it out a little bit.
[9211.03s -> 9218.44s]  That's a loss.
[9218.44s -> 9221.63s]  That's okay, that's fine.
[9221.63s -> 9224.99s]  I got a big, oh yeah, this is a big play here.
[9224.99s -> 9228.97s]  So I lost, let me think this through.
[9228.97s -> 9230.81s]  Okay, hear me out for a second.
[9230.81s -> 9236.84s]  What if I get the ant to level three, kill the ant,
[9236.84s -> 9245.35s]  do the snail, and then give food to kangaroo?
[9245.35s -> 9246.88s]  What do you think?
[9246.88s -> 9251.10s]  Sell the giraffe first?
[9251.10s -> 9258.90s]  Do not do the snail, sell the giraffe.
[9258.90s -> 9259.90s]  All right, well, I know for a fact
[9259.90s -> 9267.35s]  I'm gonna do this at least, like this is a fact.
[9267.35s -> 9271.00s]  I want him to have more health.
[9271.00s -> 9280.82s]  So now sell the giraffe, I sell giraffe,
[9280.82s -> 9290.06s]  then the ant up here, then put the snail up there.
[9290.06s -> 9293.53s]  Well, let's see what we get for the triple.
[9293.53s -> 9295.76s]  That's a fucking Thanksgiving turkey.
[9295.76s -> 9299.90s]  That's too bad that I don't have anything to summon.
[9299.90s -> 9302.06s]  Otherwise, cause this is one of the best,
[9302.06s -> 9303.42s]  this is one of the best cards in the game.
[9303.42s -> 9304.98s]  And I say that cause all I play is Hearthstone,
[9304.98s -> 9308.65s]  it's the only thing I know.
[9308.65s -> 9310.47s]  Summon, there's one here I know,
[9310.47s -> 9312.21s]  but like I'd have to throw away this whole party
[9312.21s -> 9317.68s]  and I like what's going on right now.
[9317.68s -> 9319.63s]  So what's more valuable?
[9319.63s -> 9322.91s]  Giving everybody right now on this whole team to one,
[9322.91s -> 9327.36s]  everyone, or throw away the rabbit,
[9327.36s -> 9334.98s]  get the turkey and the sheep.
[9334.98s -> 9345.47s]  I think snail is, I think it's snail.
[9345.47s -> 9353.32s]  And then I can sell the snail and put the sheep up.
[9353.32s -> 9366.99s]  Or should I do the deer, put the turkey up?
[9366.99s -> 9370.88s]  I think I like that.
[9370.88s -> 9372.10s]  Yeah, cause the bus has splash damage.
[9372.10s -> 9379.62s]  All right, so now the ant go first
[9379.62s -> 9385.27s]  cause the ant could give the six, three to the deer.
[9385.27s -> 9388.28s]  No, all right.
[9388.28s -> 9389.96s]  Now this is a big deal
[9389.96s -> 9391.56s]  cause he's going to give him seven attack.
[9391.56s -> 9392.52s]  This is huge.
[9392.52s -> 9397.07s]  The Dodo is huge.
[9397.07s -> 9399.76s]  All right, what's it going to go?
[9399.76s -> 9401.12s]  I freeze these both.
[9401.12s -> 9402.12s]  Hmm, I don't even,
[9402.12s -> 9406.77s]  I don't think I'm doing the summon thing right now.
[9406.77s -> 9410.80s]  I'll think about it.
[9410.80s -> 9412.00s]  Is this game actually fun?
[9412.00s -> 9413.72s]  Yeah, this is not like sponsored or anything.
[9413.72s -> 9415.43s]  Ludwig just said,
[9415.43s -> 9418.10s]  he was wondering if I wanted just to play in the tournament.
[9418.10s -> 9420.32s]  I was like, sure, why not?
[9420.32s -> 9423.11s]  This is a big deal cause he's going to knock this armor off.
[9423.11s -> 9425.79s]  This is huge.
[9425.79s -> 9431.37s]  That's a huge deal.
[9431.37s -> 9440.53s]  Now we need the kangaroo to carry.
[9440.53s -> 9448.04s]  All right, this is a win.
[9448.04s -> 9452.07s]  You ever going to play this again after this stream?
[9452.07s -> 9457.16s]  I mean, I don't know.
[9457.16s -> 9458.00s]  Oh shit.
[9458.00s -> 9460.91s]  All right, it's decision time.
[9460.91s -> 9463.37s]  Is it time to sell the ant,
[9463.37s -> 9465.69s]  give somebody a six, three permanently,
[9465.69s -> 9473.18s]  hopefully not the bunny.
[9473.18s -> 9478.81s]  Okay, do I sell bunny first, put turkey up,
[9478.81s -> 9485.85s]  get rid of ant.
[9485.85s -> 9490.34s]  But unfortunately I can't go over 10 gold, can I?
[9490.34s -> 9491.82s]  Oh, you can go over 10.
[9491.82s -> 9496.23s]  I thought you couldn't go over 10 unless, okay.
[9496.23s -> 9500.98s]  All right, turkey goes up, build the ant.
[9500.98s -> 9502.18s]  All right, I need something good here.
[9502.18s -> 9507.00s]  I want this to go on the kangaroo so bad.
[9507.00s -> 9508.92s]  Oh, right.
[9508.92s -> 9511.06s]  I did that in wrong order, you're right.
[9511.06s -> 9511.90s]  Oh no, okay.
[9511.90s -> 9513.10s]  Well, it's still a one out of three.
[9513.10s -> 9513.94s]  It was a 50, 50.
[9513.94s -> 9516.62s]  Fuck, it's all right.
[9516.62s -> 9522.52s]  Shit, it's all right.
[9522.52s -> 9524.01s]  Yeah.
[9524.01s -> 9528.21s]  Now we put the sheep up here.
[9528.21s -> 9529.41s]  Now we're in business.
[9529.41s -> 9536.26s]  We are in big business now.
[9536.26s -> 9537.90s]  Because this is gonna give, to anything summoned,
[9537.90s -> 9542.19s]  that includes the car.
[9542.19s -> 9545.56s]  So anybody that's summoned gets three, three.
[9545.56s -> 9547.64s]  This is gonna be okay.
[9547.64s -> 9549.11s]  I still have money.
[9549.11s -> 9550.57s]  What do I wanna do with my last bit of money?
[9550.57s -> 9554.56s]  Let's see, let's roll.
[9554.56s -> 9557.22s]  All right, this is, okay.
[9557.22s -> 9559.56s]  Really, really good.
[9559.56s -> 9561.25s]  Very good for me.
[9561.25s -> 9564.40s]  I'm gonna freeze.
[9564.40s -> 9572.53s]  Do I just use the dodo now or use the food?
[9572.53s -> 9578.54s]  Yeah, buy the dodo now.
[9578.54s -> 9579.90s]  I'm gonna hold onto these
[9579.90s -> 9582.54s]  because I wanna give it to, I don't know, maybe somebody.
[9582.54s -> 9585.59s]  All right, nice.
[9585.59s -> 9586.61s]  Level the deer up.
[9586.61s -> 9594.42s]  I don't think I'm doing the turtle.
[9594.42s -> 9595.26s]  What does freezing do?
[9595.26s -> 9596.30s]  Freezing means that you're guaranteeing
[9596.30s -> 9598.88s]  that that will show up next turn.
[9598.88s -> 9599.72s]  So it doesn't go away.
[9599.72s -> 9605.34s]  It doesn't get rolled out.
[9605.34s -> 9609.10s]  That is a monster back there, that kangaroo.
[9609.10s -> 9611.85s]  Beautiful, beautiful.
[9611.85s -> 9613.90s]  More splash damage, beautiful.
[9613.90s -> 9620.43s]  Four, beautiful.
[9620.43s -> 9624.03s]  Oh shit, but this thing is murdering people.
[9624.03s -> 9628.07s]  What was going on there?
[9628.07s -> 9629.15s]  I still win.
[9629.15s -> 9630.39s]  What the hell?
[9630.39s -> 9631.87s]  That thing was doing so much damage.
[9631.87s -> 9641.80s]  Is it gonna unhurt?
[9641.80s -> 9642.92s]  Can't do that.
[9642.92s -> 9645.46s]  I guess I could.
[9645.46s -> 9647.40s]  Is it time to get rid of the dodo?
[9647.40s -> 9656.84s]  No.
[9656.84s -> 9658.26s]  I'm really looking for another deer
[9658.30s -> 9671.54s]  or another dodo.
[9672.94s -> 9677.90s]  The sheep or the rooster?
[9677.90s -> 9685.94s]  That's actually a pretty good play.
[9685.94s -> 9694.18s]  Now we just use, let me roll because I can do it.
[9694.18s -> 9697.34s]  Copy ability from pet ahead as a level one until the best.
[9697.34s -> 9703.33s]  So this copies whatever the person in front does.
[9703.33s -> 9706.52s]  Parrot could copy dodo.
[9706.52s -> 9707.84s]  So would that mean that the parrot
[9707.84s -> 9709.44s]  would give the dodo three attack?
[9709.44s -> 9713.53s]  Yeah.
[9713.53s -> 9715.41s]  Does the parrot copy the bus?
[9715.41s -> 9719.88s]  The parrot would, yeah, the parrot would copy the deer.
[9719.88s -> 9721.54s]  Parrot is trash.
[9721.54s -> 9723.59s]  Well, I don't know.
[9723.59s -> 9726.27s]  Copy the turkey.
[9726.27s -> 9728.35s]  Oh shit.
[9728.35s -> 9730.41s]  Copy the turkey so then anything they could summon
[9730.41s -> 9734.12s]  gets a six, six.
[9734.12s -> 9735.77s]  That's not bad.
[9735.77s -> 9739.52s]  That's kind of cool.
[9739.52s -> 9742.48s]  But what would I get rid of?
[9742.48s -> 9745.04s]  Like everyone up here is way too important right now.
[9745.04s -> 9749.77s]  It would be an 11, 11 bus.
[9749.77s -> 9750.69s]  I don't have space for it.
[9750.69s -> 9761.05s]  I don't.
[9761.05s -> 9763.53s]  Eat shop food, give two random friends one, one.
[9771.79s -> 9772.63s]  Good.
[9772.63s -> 9775.53s]  That's really good.
[9775.53s -> 9776.65s]  I'm not gonna give that to anybody else.
[9776.65s -> 9777.49s]  All right, come on.
[9777.49s -> 9783.12s]  Let's go.
[9783.12s -> 9785.97s]  How many vitamin gummies can you eat in one sitting?
[9785.97s -> 9787.45s]  Why would you eat that many vitamin gummies?
[9787.45s -> 9790.88s]  That's like bad for you.
[9790.88s -> 9793.08s]  This is an instant kill.
[9793.08s -> 9795.64s]  Thankfully, he's not gonna be able to go through it.
[9795.64s -> 9796.48s]  It's gonna kill.
[9797.00s -> 9800.90s]  Thank God.
[9800.90s -> 9803.78s]  This motherfucker though.
[9803.78s -> 9804.62s]  Die.
[9804.62s -> 9806.02s]  Damn it.
[9806.02s -> 9806.84s]  Oh yes.
[9806.84s -> 9809.79s]  The turkey saved it.
[9809.79s -> 9810.63s]  Oh shit.
[9810.63s -> 9813.12s]  This is gonna be rough.
[9813.12s -> 9814.88s]  No.
[9814.88s -> 9821.11s]  No, he's had so much.
[9821.11s -> 9825.71s]  Damn it.
[9825.71s -> 9826.53s]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9826.53s -> 9827.37s]  This is where it gets weird.
[9827.37s -> 9828.21s]  All right.
[9828.21s -> 9830.83s]  Gorilla, when it gets hurt, gains a coconut shield.
[9830.83s -> 9833.14s]  Works one time per turn.
[9833.14s -> 9836.29s]  It ignores all damage once.
[9836.29s -> 9837.13s]  This is a snake.
[9837.13s -> 9840.68s]  Okay, so friend, when the person ahead of you attacks,
[9840.68s -> 9851.58s]  deal five damage to a random person.
[9851.58s -> 9853.20s]  These two seem like a no-brainer,
[9854.58s -> 9860.81s]  but I don't know which one's better.
[9860.81s -> 9866.05s]  Behind the, I feel like it would be better behind somebody
[9866.05s -> 9868.22s]  that can, probably the kangaroo, right?
[9868.22s -> 9869.58s]  Because the kangaroo is gonna be able to swing
[9869.58s -> 9878.61s]  the most amount of times.
[9878.61s -> 9881.04s]  Put the dodo on the rooster now.
[9881.04s -> 9886.36s]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[9888.70s -> 9891.06s]  Or I could use the deer, but ah.
[9891.06s -> 9891.90s]  All right, hold on.
[9891.90s -> 9892.96s]  Let's do this.
[9892.96s -> 9897.48s]  If I find chocolate, then the deer is gonna stay.
[9897.48s -> 9908.56s]  I need to try it real once.
[9908.56s -> 9909.60s]  Fuck that splash damage.
[9909.60s -> 9910.94s]  That's good.
[9915.96s -> 9920.15s]  I feel like somebody should have this.
[9920.15s -> 9922.45s]  Food with health and attack effects
[9922.45s -> 9927.27s]  are doubled.
[9927.27s -> 9929.41s]  Splash on the kangaroo, that's probably the play,
[9929.41s -> 9936.28s]  but that would get rid of the garlic armor.
[9936.28s -> 9942.82s]  I'm gonna roll one more time.
[9942.82s -> 9945.70s]  Give it to the deer.
[9945.70s -> 9948.10s]  Yeah, because it's always five damage,
[9948.10s -> 9950.34s]  so it's gonna do five splash regardless.
[9950.34s -> 9952.06s]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[9952.06s -> 9958.49s]  Let's do another roll.
[9958.49s -> 9959.97s]  Fly, when a friend faints,
[9959.97s -> 9967.10s]  summon a two-two fly in its place?
[9967.10s -> 9975.65s]  I feel like that would be better than the turkey.
[9975.65s -> 9981.83s]  No, I see the tier six and I go better.
[9981.83s -> 9984.04s]  Turkey and the fly.
[9984.04s -> 9994.04s]  So is it time to get rid of the dodo or the rooster?
[9994.08s -> 9998.95s]  Turkey and fly is big, big, big.
[9998.95s -> 9999.79s]  Dodo sucks.
[9999.79s -> 10002.27s]  Dodo or kangaroo, but this is the only reason
[10002.27s -> 10005.90s]  why it can even hurt anything right at this stage.
[10005.90s -> 10007.74s]  I think sell dodo, but that's a hard call.
[10007.74s -> 10011.59s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[10011.59s -> 10012.69s]  Yeah, all right.
[10012.69s -> 10022.18s]  We're gonna replace dodo with the fly.
[10022.18s -> 10027.33s]  And then, hold on.
[10027.33s -> 10030.80s]  I have another rooster.
[10030.80s -> 10033.57s]  Fly, rooster.
[10033.57s -> 10037.93s]  When a summon a two-two fly in its place.
[10037.93s -> 10046.48s]  Okay, I ruined it, how?
[10046.48s -> 10055.27s]  Okay, so I'm gonna do, yeah, okay.
[10055.27s -> 10057.99s]  But now, but there's not enough room.
[10057.99s -> 10066.27s]  Does the kangaroo need to go first?
[10066.27s -> 10072.02s]  Because this is gonna summon a bus
[10072.02s -> 10075.11s]  and it's not gonna be able to summon the two-two fly.
[10075.11s -> 10076.99s]  So I feel like this needs to be first
[10076.99s -> 10079.25s]  because this has to die,
[10079.25s -> 10082.98s]  then there's enough room for all the summons.
[10082.98s -> 10087.96s]  Is that wrong?
[10087.96s -> 10090.12s]  No?
[10090.12s -> 10094.53s]  Yeah, isn't that correct?
[10094.53s -> 10098.73s]  It's fine, you just miss one fly.
[10098.73s -> 10103.68s]  Turkey won't buff it.
[10103.68s -> 10107.65s]  Don't put kangaroo first, it will not use its ability.
[10107.65s -> 10109.25s]  Let's, yeah, okay, that's true.
[10109.25s -> 10115.42s]  Well, let's just see how this goes.
[10115.42s -> 10118.34s]  Maybe like this?
[10118.34s -> 10125.60s]  I think that's the fly.
[10125.60s -> 10130.50s]  All right, yeah, let's go.
[10130.50s -> 10135.61s]  Because I'm just imagining it won't summon all the flies.
[10135.65s -> 10137.44s]  Well, we lost anyways.
[10137.44s -> 10144.06s]  I don't think we're getting through this one.
[10144.06s -> 10151.87s]  Maybe, that's so good, but it's too late.
[10151.87s -> 10155.97s]  It's too late.
[10155.97s -> 10157.01s]  Is it too late?
[10157.01s -> 10161.03s]  Maybe, no, maybe not.
[10161.03s -> 10162.63s]  I think this might be, no, it's not.
[10162.63s -> 10165.76s]  This might be a win.
[10165.76s -> 10166.60s]  Is it?
[10166.60s -> 10168.88s]  I can't tell.
[10168.88s -> 10173.27s]  21, 10, this is a win.
[10173.27s -> 10181.63s]  Holy shit.
[10181.63s -> 10187.24s]  All right, well, that's really good.
[10187.24s -> 10189.30s]  I need to level up one of these guys,
[10189.30s -> 10194.30s]  especially the fly or the turkey.
[10194.30s -> 10196.10s]  Scorpion's so good though, it's an instant kill.
[10196.10s -> 10200.99s]  It kills anything one hit.
[10200.99s -> 10203.39s]  Do I stick with the plan and just keep this team going
[10203.39s -> 10207.26s]  and try to buff this team?
[10207.26s -> 10211.62s]  Or do I replace somebody with the instant kill Scorpion?
[10211.62s -> 10213.42s]  Just stick with it?
[10213.42s -> 10214.30s]  What about the food?
[10214.30s -> 10218.94s]  The canned food is usually really good, right?
[10218.94s -> 10220.14s]  Or are we just skipping everything
[10220.14s -> 10229.02s]  and just trying to buff these guys only?
[10229.02s -> 10231.42s]  Buff, buff, buff, just only roll for food
[10231.42s -> 10234.34s]  and buff this team, food.
[10234.34s -> 10235.50s]  Buff only the current team.
[10235.50s -> 10240.94s]  All right, let's go.
[10240.94s -> 10243.18s]  Oh, that's cheese pizza.
[10243.18s -> 10245.86s]  Okay, if the cheese pizza goes to,
[10245.86s -> 10252.08s]  oh, that's a cheese pizza.
[10252.08s -> 10256.78s]  Bingo, exactly who I wanted it on.
[10256.82s -> 10259.58s]  Give me another rooster or another deer, come on.
[10259.58s -> 10271.21s]  Or two turkeys, I want two turkeys.
[10271.21s -> 10273.61s]  Give other level two and three friends one, one.
[10273.61s -> 10276.22s]  I don't have any.
[10276.22s -> 10281.24s]  I guess I could just do this on the kangaroo.
[10281.24s -> 10285.33s]  Let's hold that for a second.
[10285.33s -> 10289.75s]  I can't sell anybody, we gotta run this to the end.
[10289.75s -> 10292.51s]  Back for 20 more damage once.
[10292.51s -> 10295.23s]  Oh, the shark, friend faints two, one.
[10295.23s -> 10297.53s]  That's a lot of fainting.
[10297.53s -> 10303.63s]  That's a lot of fainting.
[10303.63s -> 10312.23s]  But the stake on the deer, is the shark a trap?
[10312.23s -> 10313.43s]  Fly is better.
[10313.43s -> 10317.86s]  Yeah, the fly I think might be actually better.
[10317.86s -> 10319.76s]  Freeze the shark at least, okay.
[10319.76s -> 10331.44s]  Well, if I can't lose, if I lose it's over.
[10331.44s -> 10332.96s]  Put the stake on the deer,
[10332.96s -> 10336.69s]  because it's a guaranteed more than 20 damage.
[10336.69s -> 10338.62s]  I'm either gonna do that
[10338.62s -> 10342.55s]  or I'm gonna do the three, three on the kangaroo.
[10342.55s -> 10345.60s]  I can roll again, but do I,
[10345.60s -> 10349.97s]  I think I need to save the stake.
[10349.97s -> 10353.48s]  Let's roll.
[10353.48s -> 10357.52s]  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
[10357.52s -> 10360.46s]  Why can this not be like a turn ago?
[10360.46s -> 10365.82s]  Oh my God, this would be insane.
[10365.82s -> 10371.25s]  Because that means he would be doing four, four.
[10371.25s -> 10373.03s]  Stake on the deer, freeze everybody,
[10373.85s -> 10374.69s]  because the cow is crazy too,
[10374.69s -> 10383.55s]  but I can't replace anybody.
[10383.55s -> 10386.49s]  All right, we'll go and stake in the front.
[10386.49s -> 10389.22s]  This is, I have to play for the win, right?
[10389.22s -> 10390.86s]  He'll kill the first thing.
[10390.86s -> 10395.98s]  Next round we get a level, okay, here we go.
[10395.98s -> 10398.10s]  I should freeze the cow, because then I could sell,
[10398.10s -> 10404.22s]  mm, shark better than kangaroo.
[10404.22s -> 10405.88s]  I don't know, not at this stage.
[10405.88s -> 10411.34s]  Especially if I can get him to like a 30, 30.
[10411.34s -> 10413.26s]  Yeah, no, no, I'm sticking with the plan.
[10413.26s -> 10414.94s]  If we live, we live.
[10414.94s -> 10422.30s]  I'm going, let's go.
[10422.30s -> 10425.84s]  Because there's nobody I can really replace.
[10425.84s -> 10429.20s]  The dog is terrifying, but I think, oh, yeah.
[10430.04s -> 10432.34s]  Oh man, okay, hold on.
[10432.34s -> 10435.70s]  All right, what we got?
[10435.70s -> 10438.54s]  That dog is terrifying, but I should be all right.
[10438.54s -> 10443.34s]  I think I'm going to be okay.
[10443.34s -> 10452.78s]  21, two, 18.
[10452.78s -> 10455.48s]  All right, come on, come on.
[10455.48s -> 10461.30s]  No, damn it, no.
[10461.30s -> 10464.50s]  He was just too strong.
[10464.50s -> 10467.73s]  He's just had too much attack and too much health.
[10467.73s -> 10473.66s]  Not well, double monkey.
[10473.66s -> 10478.08s]  I'm not sure I was going to get over that one.
[10478.08s -> 10480.44s]  Damn it, it's that kangaroo pole
[10480.44s -> 10488.01s]  couldn't happen last turn.
[10488.05s -> 10494.69s]  Oh well, that's fun, this game's fun.
[10494.69s -> 10501.19s]  All right, we're going beaver, cricket.
[10501.19s -> 10505.53s]  I mean, the horse sucks, but I can just sell him.
[10505.53s -> 10510.63s]  I should just roll.
[10510.63s -> 10516.00s]  Cricket sucks too, the horse is worse.
[10516.00s -> 10531.50s]  Just to go for the stats, mosquito.
[10531.50s -> 10534.06s]  Try to get ant, yeah.
[10534.06s -> 10543.38s]  I think ant's the best tier one person.
[10543.38s -> 10546.33s]  This is just a trade, so it's, oh no, it's not.
[10546.33s -> 10547.41s]  Oh no, this is a loss.
[10552.60s -> 10553.88s]  Remember the timer, it's been two hours
[10553.88s -> 10556.42s]  since you said 30 minutes.
[10556.42s -> 10557.50s]  Yeah, but what else am I doing right now?
[10557.50s -> 10563.54s]  I'm fine.
[10563.54s -> 10575.17s]  Fuck it, has more stats right now,
[10575.17s -> 10578.04s]  but it summons the one, one rap of the other team.
[10578.72s -> 10585.37s]  You know, yeah, let's just go for it.
[10585.37s -> 10592.89s]  Cricket first, oh no, he should probably be first.
[10592.89s -> 10594.99s]  Didn't you say this is going to be like 30 more minutes?
[10594.99s -> 10608.77s]  Yeah, I'm having fun though, but the rat last.
[10608.77s -> 10616.19s]  Nice, why last?
[10616.19s -> 10618.43s]  I don't know, because he has the most health,
[10618.43s -> 10623.56s]  but I kind of want him to tank.
[10623.56s -> 10629.78s]  Turns out it didn't matter.
[10629.78s -> 10633.06s]  Well, that cricket upgrade seemed like now a good idea,
[10633.06s -> 10635.81s]  although this is going to be tricky.
[10635.81s -> 10641.58s]  No, this is a loss.
[10641.58s -> 10642.62s]  Do I have to give this homework?
[10642.62s -> 10644.26s]  Don't remind him, oh, they're reminding me
[10644.26s -> 10647.74s]  to turn the stream off.
[10647.74s -> 10650.06s]  Well, I'll be back on Sunday.
[10650.06s -> 10651.06s]  This is just going to be a little thing
[10651.06s -> 10653.80s]  just to kind of jump in and play around with them.
[10653.80s -> 10667.22s]  The tournament, that looks good.
[10667.22s -> 10668.66s]  That looks good too.
[10668.66s -> 10669.98s]  I like the swan.
[10669.98s -> 10672.98s]  I like the spider as well.
[10672.98s -> 10674.98s]  Do a bug tier list.
[10674.98s -> 10679.94s]  Every single bug at F, honey bees at S,
[10679.94s -> 10687.70s]  praying mantis at S, a big stag beetle at A,
[10695.58s -> 10705.30s]  and that's it.
[10705.30s -> 10707.42s]  What about butterfly?
[10707.42s -> 10709.98s]  Ah, B, A, not A.
[10709.98s -> 10710.82s]  What about a worm?
[10710.82s -> 10720.91s]  A worm's not a bug.
[10720.91s -> 10727.14s]  A worm is a bug?
[10727.14s -> 10730.78s]  Worm is, no, that doesn't classify as an insecto,
[10730.78s -> 10733.06s]  whatever they're called.
[10733.10s -> 10734.06s]  A worm is a bug?
[10734.06s -> 10739.06s]  I thought a worm was something else.
[10739.06s -> 10740.06s]  It's not an insect.
[10740.06s -> 10744.94s]  Yeah, I thought that's not an insect.
[10744.94s -> 10750.17s]  Is it, okay, worm, bug?
[10750.17s -> 10753.68s]  Isn't it like a nematode or something?
[10753.68s -> 10754.80s]  No, worms are not insects.
[10754.80s -> 10756.32s]  Both worms and insects are classified
[10756.32s -> 10759.98s]  under the kingdom animalia?
[10759.98s -> 10762.38s]  Vertebrae, animals with a backbone,
[10762.38s -> 10764.22s]  and invertebrae, animals without a backbone.
[10764.22s -> 10766.06s]  Are worms insects or animals?
[10766.06s -> 10773.21s]  Are worms considered a bug?
[10773.21s -> 10780.30s]  What is an, no, it's not a bug.
[10780.30s -> 10789.58s]  It's like an invertebrate worm thing.
[10789.58s -> 10799.77s]  They're like nematodes or something.
[10800.01s -> 10804.26s]  Okay, although they are indeed invertebrate insects,
[10804.26s -> 10806.30s]  worms definitely are not insects.
[10806.30s -> 10810.58s]  Even segmented worms are not classified as an insect.
[10810.58s -> 10816.76s]  They're just called an invertebrate worm.
[10816.76s -> 10821.26s]  Okay, well, there's a post on MMO Champion
[10821.26s -> 10822.98s]  from like 10 years ago.
[10822.98s -> 10824.54s]  Somebody please settle a debate with me.
[10824.54s -> 10828.75s]  Are worms bugs?
[10828.75s -> 10835.22s]  It looks like this has been a battle for a century.
[10835.22s -> 10838.16s]  I disagree, I don't think that worms are bugs.
[10838.16s -> 10841.06s]  They're like an inanimate, not inanimate object.
[10841.06s -> 10842.98s]  They're an invertebrate object.
[10842.98s -> 10843.82s]  Whoa.
[10845.60s -> 10854.91s]  Okay, I'm gonna sell the beaver.
[10854.91s -> 10856.87s]  They didn't want it to go on either one of these two.
[10856.87s -> 10871.16s]  Not really, but you know, we kinda have to do this now.
[10877.47s -> 10883.24s]  All right, what does a level two rat do?
[10883.24s -> 10892.58s]  Does it just get rid of the dirty one, one rat?
[10892.58s -> 10893.84s]  I don't think I really want the spider.
[10893.84s -> 10895.68s]  Let's just get something else.
[10895.68s -> 10897.83s]  Oh boy, oh boy.
[10897.83s -> 10908.76s]  Well, okay, I'm gonna kill that next turn.
[10908.76s -> 10919.55s]  Forget about the dog.
[10919.55s -> 10924.02s]  Why isn't the rat last?
[10924.02s -> 10926.40s]  So it summons a one, one for your opponent
[10926.40s -> 10927.60s]  that betrays them.
[10927.60s -> 10932.02s]  What does that even mean?
[10932.02s -> 10933.08s]  Friend to head deal.
[10933.08s -> 10939.60s]  So you deal one damage to the friend to head?
[10939.60s -> 10946.37s]  What?
[10946.37s -> 10960.28s]  What the fuck?
[10960.28s -> 10966.28s]  Well, let's do this.
[10966.28s -> 10969.24s]  Okay, all right.
[10969.24s -> 10978.06s]  It's time to get rid of the ant and the mosquito.
[10978.06s -> 10981.58s]  Or should I roll for a level two ant?
[10981.58s -> 10985.06s]  Let's get rid of the mosquito.
[10985.06s -> 10990.49s]  Put up the penguin.
[10990.49s -> 10992.56s]  Wait, let me get this in the right order.
[10992.56s -> 10997.12s]  Put up the penguin, sell the ant.
[10997.12s -> 11001.51s]  Sell the ant now probably,
[11001.51s -> 11008.44s]  because I don't really want it to go on the penguin, do I?
[11008.48s -> 11010.20s]  I'd rather it go on somebody else.
[11010.20s -> 11012.82s]  Okay, that's fine.
[11012.82s -> 11016.80s]  Get you up there, upgrade the rat.
[11016.80s -> 11017.84s]  No, not yet, hold on.
[11017.84s -> 11025.85s]  Let's do another roll.
[11030.02s -> 11031.26s]  I just do two rats.
[11031.26s -> 11034.68s]  Don't upgrade, just have two rats.
[11034.68s -> 11039.67s]  It's gonna, I think, screw me over later.
[11039.67s -> 11043.25s]  I can roll one more time.
[11043.25s -> 11044.78s]  Get the sheep.
[11067.76s -> 11079.36s]  I think I'm just gonna do the rat.
[11080.85s -> 11085.65s]  He's gonna give one, one to everybody here.
[11085.65s -> 11087.15s]  Worm is a worm.
[11087.15s -> 11091.04s]  All right, this is kind of a shitty team, but whatever.
[11091.04s -> 11096.73s]  The rat is the worst unit in the game.
[11097.57s -> 11101.66s]  Well, sorry.
[11101.66s -> 11102.98s]  You want me to read that so bad.
[11102.98s -> 11106.98s]  I've seen you write that twice, at least.
[11106.98s -> 11108.74s]  You want me to say that so bad.
[11108.74s -> 11111.96s]  I've seen you write that more than two times.
[11111.96s -> 11115.81s]  I'm not gonna read it.
[11115.81s -> 11117.21s]  You wrote it 10 times.
[11117.21s -> 11119.30s]  Okay, well, whatever.
[11119.30s -> 11124.48s]  Let's go.
[11124.48s -> 11128.93s]  I feel like this is not that bad.
[11128.93s -> 11130.41s]  I should be able to get through the first two
[11130.41s -> 11134.64s]  with the cricket.
[11134.64s -> 11136.12s]  Yeah, the first three with the cricket, actually.
[11136.12s -> 11139.44s]  This is good, because the cricket's a two-two,
[11139.44s -> 11145.69s]  because he's, oh, nevermind.
[11145.69s -> 11158.11s]  Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[11158.11s -> 11159.87s]  No, they're gonna win.
[11159.87s -> 11170.19s]  The rat's the worst unit in the game.
[11170.19s -> 11172.91s]  But I'm kind of stuck with the rat.
[11201.37s -> 11207.70s]  Look at his roll.
[11207.70s -> 11210.64s]  It's good, but not really.
[11210.64s -> 11212.16s]  Rab, copy the health.
[11218.39s -> 11220.03s]  Whale, rat, why would I do that?
[11220.03s -> 11239.72s]  Oh, I mean, I could do rabbit salad bowl.
[11239.72s -> 11245.20s]  Kill the rat, the whale behind the rat.
[11245.20s -> 11248.58s]  Why would I do that?
[11248.58s -> 11253.53s]  Ox and otter.
[11253.53s -> 11260.92s]  I'm going rabbit salad,
[11260.92s -> 11261.96s]  just in case I get something good.
[11261.96s -> 11272.70s]  Hold on, not really.
[11272.70s -> 11285.45s]  Actually really good that it hit those two.
[11285.49s -> 11290.20s]  I'll hold on to the dodo, maybe.
[11290.20s -> 11293.89s]  No, actually, it's probably too late for the dodo.
[11293.89s -> 11304.99s]  Yeah, let's just go.
[11304.99s -> 11307.07s]  Hailing the rat would just give me a one-one.
[11307.07s -> 11312.86s]  I don't know how that even works.
[11312.86s -> 11318.38s]  That's a wash, but he comes back.
[11319.70s -> 11324.93s]  This is gonna be tough.
[11324.93s -> 11327.00s]  Yeah, I'm in trouble.
[11327.00s -> 11340.03s]  I just didn't scale that well.
[11340.03s -> 11345.27s]  That's not bad.
[11345.27s -> 11347.11s]  That's actually really pretty good.
[11347.11s -> 11357.39s]  Deal five damage to the lowest enemy with the lowest health.
[11357.39s -> 11365.61s]  I think it's dolphin in the back, or even in the front.
[11365.61s -> 11366.65s]  Wait, snail first.
[11366.65s -> 11369.85s]  Wait, I think I want the dolphin
[11369.85s -> 11373.04s]  to get the buff from the snail.
[11373.04s -> 11374.49s]  Can I get rid of the rabbit?
[11374.49s -> 11375.69s]  Oh, what happened?
[11375.69s -> 11376.53s]  No!
[11380.22s -> 11381.06s]  I was trying.
[11386.00s -> 11395.40s]  I apparently had this selected, and I clicked what?
[11395.40s -> 11396.44s]  Oh, fuck.
[11396.44s -> 11400.21s]  Okay, well, whatever, goodbye.
[11400.21s -> 11428.76s]  That kinda sucks.
[11428.76s -> 11436.36s]  Put him first, because he only does that once.
[11436.36s -> 11437.60s]  Elephant would be good if I don't have anybody
[11437.60s -> 11445.50s]  that can benefit.
[11445.50s -> 11451.94s]  Yeah, we'll put him first, or rat first.
[11451.94s -> 11459.79s]  This game free, this game is free.
[11459.79s -> 11464.87s]  I believe this is $5 to buy the extra animals.
[11464.87s -> 11467.98s]  So, I believe this is free.
[11467.98s -> 11474.43s]  That rat sucks, but I think I win this.
[11474.43s -> 11476.03s]  It's not that good, actually.
[11476.03s -> 11478.30s]  That kind of is really bad.
[11478.30s -> 11480.83s]  That's not good.
[11480.83s -> 11486.43s]  I just gave him free buffs to everybody.
[11486.43s -> 11497.27s]  I think I still might win this, though.
[11497.27s -> 11505.33s]  Only one win, oh my God.
[11507.40s -> 11510.64s]  I know, I gotta get rid of the bunny.
[11510.64s -> 11511.60s]  Maybe the penguin, too.
[11511.60s -> 11522.20s]  Penguin's not doing anything right now.
[11522.20s -> 11527.73s]  Crab behind rat is not bad.
[11527.73s -> 11530.73s]  Then just feed the crab.
[11530.73s -> 11538.52s]  Hippo is amazing as well.
[11538.52s -> 11540.32s]  Think it's time to get rid of the penguin,
[11540.32s -> 11546.52s]  because the rabbit, I can feed the hippo,
[11546.56s -> 11552.32s]  and he'll get extra health from that.
[11552.32s -> 11564.22s]  I think that's what I'm doing.
[11564.22s -> 11569.42s]  Very good, roll again.
[11569.42s -> 11571.26s]  Really wanted something else besides this.
[11571.26s -> 11575.56s]  These two, it could have been anything else.
[11575.56s -> 11579.58s]  It could have been anything else but these two.
[11579.58s -> 11581.46s]  But, I mean, I have to use it,
[11581.46s -> 11598.26s]  because he's gonna get the health.
[11598.26s -> 11599.58s]  I feel like I should put him behind,
[11599.58s -> 11600.74s]  still put him behind.
[11600.74s -> 11605.03s]  I don't think he has enough damage to kill anything.
[11605.03s -> 11610.20s]  Well, I'm dead anyways, so let's go.
[11610.20s -> 11614.75s]  This is a dead rat run.
[11614.75s -> 11621.00s]  Oh, hold on, hold on.
[11621.00s -> 11624.30s]  Ooh, that's good.
[11624.30s -> 11627.15s]  What'd he just kill?
[11627.15s -> 11632.98s]  This is okay.
[11633.02s -> 11634.88s]  I think this is all right.
[11634.88s -> 11636.40s]  It is.
[11636.40s -> 11638.70s]  We live another day.
[11638.70s -> 11642.23s]  The bunny, yeah.
[11642.23s -> 11656.92s]  14 damage, holy shit.
[11656.92s -> 11664.89s]  Splash damage on, these are all good,
[11664.89s -> 11666.65s]  but it's almost like I can't even do it.
[11666.65s -> 11669.50s]  It's too late.
[11669.50s -> 11671.86s]  The shark with all the bees, yeah.
[11671.86s -> 11674.44s]  It's, okay, I gotta get rid of the rabbit,
[11674.44s -> 11675.40s]  and we're gonna do shark,
[11675.40s -> 11682.83s]  and we're gonna do bee on everybody.
[11682.83s -> 11694.73s]  Yeah, I'm gonna put bee on the dolphin.
[11694.73s -> 11702.78s]  Bee on dolphin or bee on, okay.
[11702.78s -> 11708.03s]  Splash damage for, oh, let's roll.
[11708.03s -> 11714.70s]  This emote is vile, I don't even know what I'm looking at.
[11714.74s -> 11719.85s]  Couldn't give me anything that could work with me here.
[11719.85s -> 11729.56s]  I could just do, roll again.
[11729.56s -> 11734.50s]  Heal seven damage to the last enemy?
[11734.50s -> 11737.50s]  I could just be the cricket.
[11737.50s -> 11743.13s]  Yeah, this is really like kind of a last ditch ever here.
[11743.13s -> 11748.76s]  Let's just try to, let's just smoke this guy up.
[11748.76s -> 11750.38s]  That's the best thing I got.
[11750.38s -> 11752.89s]  Let's hope I don't lose.
[11752.89s -> 11754.96s]  Are you streaming on a Tuesday?
[11754.96s -> 11757.05s]  I wasn't planning on streaming,
[11757.05s -> 11759.72s]  but I was like, you know what, let's go,
[11759.72s -> 11763.81s]  because I was playing in the Ludwig's Auto Pets Tournament,
[11763.81s -> 11765.69s]  which I did okay.
[11765.69s -> 11766.53s]  I did all right.
[11766.53s -> 11767.77s]  I came in last place.
[11767.89s -> 11770.16s]  I lost every game I played in a row,
[11770.16s -> 11773.57s]  and I forgot the rules the first three matches,
[11773.57s -> 11774.61s]  but it was not, it wasn't bad.
[11774.61s -> 11778.06s]  It was okay.
[11778.06s -> 11779.46s]  I think this actually might work out.
[11779.46s -> 11782.22s]  The shark's gonna get just so fed.
[11782.22s -> 11786.77s]  It really depends on what happens here.
[11786.77s -> 11789.80s]  I think this is a win.
[11789.80s -> 11794.64s]  Yeah, he's gonna be too fed.
[11794.64s -> 11801.04s]  Bee shark strategy seems to be pretty good,
[11801.04s -> 11801.88s]  because here we go.
[11801.88s -> 11804.92s]  All right, he's got 11.
[11804.92s -> 11807.60s]  He'll have, how much will he have?
[11807.60s -> 11810.40s]  13, oh, fuck no.
[11810.40s -> 11813.15s]  Nevermind, it's over.
[11813.15s -> 11820.72s]  Oh well, that was never great.
[11820.72s -> 11822.60s]  All right, I have to pee again.
[11822.60s -> 11824.29s]  What's wrong with me?
[11824.97s -> 11825.81s]  Is he not in the tournament anymore?
[11825.81s -> 11827.66s]  No, I lost.
[11827.66s -> 11828.50s]  I'll play another one.
[11828.50s -> 11829.54s]  I'll play one more, maybe.
[11829.54s -> 11830.68s]  We'll do one more.
[11830.68s -> 11831.60s]  But I have to pee again,
[11831.60s -> 11832.44s]  because I don't know, my body,
[11832.44s -> 11834.61s]  I don't know what's wrong with me.
[11834.61s -> 12021.01s]  I'll be right back.
[12021.01s -> 12030.85s]  One more.
[12030.85s -> 12032.81s]  Oh, it's Jebaited, but it's a turkey.
[12032.81s -> 12038.06s]  Okay, I get it.
[12038.06s -> 12042.24s]  I was trying, I thought it was a flying skull.
[12042.24s -> 12044.45s]  Flames behind it.
[12044.45s -> 12050.78s]  He was going really fast, I don't know.
[12050.78s -> 12063.86s]  Hey, let's go back, okay.
[12063.86s -> 12066.22s]  Very nice.
[12066.22s -> 12070.41s]  It's just time to continue.
[12070.41s -> 12071.49s]  All right, last one.
[12071.49s -> 12079.13s]  All right off the bat, this is a great one.
[12079.13s -> 12082.13s]  Already, right off the bat.
[12082.13s -> 12085.71s]  Beautiful.
[12085.71s -> 12090.68s]  Oh, yuck.
[12091.44s -> 12097.12s]  Oh, it's, ah, I didn't want to do that.
[12099.47s -> 12101.31s]  I wanted to move him.
[12101.31s -> 12103.55s]  Fuck, come on.
[12103.55s -> 12106.40s]  Okay, it's, oh, listen to me.
[12106.40s -> 12109.90s]  It's right, you hold right click to move.
[12109.90s -> 12111.18s]  You don't hold left click to move.
[12111.18s -> 12117.02s]  Don't make the mistake I keep making.
[12117.02s -> 12135.57s]  Shit, it's right click.
[12135.57s -> 12139.08s]  It's okay, I think this is still a win.
[12139.08s -> 12139.92s]  Or it's a draw?
[12139.92s -> 12149.55s]  No, it's a win.
[12149.55s -> 12150.49s]  Because my brain just wants to move,
[12150.49s -> 12151.65s]  like move you this way, move you that way,
[12151.65s -> 12153.17s]  but I got to burn that in my brain.
[12153.17s -> 12157.28s]  It's right click, right click, right click.
[12158.12s -> 12162.93s]  I like the fish on low levels.
[12162.93s -> 12177.08s]  Ooh, okay, nice.
[12177.08s -> 12180.55s]  I like it, looks good.
[12180.55s -> 12181.39s]  You have to pee?
[12181.39s -> 12194.69s]  We just went pee.
[12194.69s -> 12197.16s]  Go to the fish behind you, nice, perfect.
[12197.16s -> 12207.53s]  I'll just clean the rest of this up.
[12207.53s -> 12209.64s]  I have mine, why are you saying we?
[12209.64s -> 12211.68s]  Well, we as in collectively,
[12211.68s -> 12216.39s]  we all went to the bathroom five minutes ago.
[12216.39s -> 12217.75s]  Oh, beautiful.
[12217.75s -> 12219.51s]  It's like the game wants me to win.
[12219.51s -> 12227.36s]  It actually really wants me to win.
[12227.36s -> 12236.52s]  I mean, it's just good for now.
[12236.52s -> 12238.28s]  How come, does it just say giraffe?
[12238.28s -> 12239.48s]  How come it doesn't say that for anybody else?
[12239.48s -> 12242.70s]  That's the only person that says that.
[12242.74s -> 12243.74s]  Did I bring that up earlier?
[12243.74s -> 12254.10s]  That's weird.
[12254.10s -> 12262.24s]  Nice, nice, oh, nice.
[12262.24s -> 12265.38s]  All right, I think I'm gonna hold that sheep.
[12265.38s -> 12267.57s]  I'm gonna hold the meat.
[12267.57s -> 12269.25s]  I'm gonna give this to you
[12269.25s -> 12272.82s]  because I want you to have more health.
[12272.82s -> 12274.93s]  Yeah, well, they don't make noise.
[12274.93s -> 12286.10s]  Oh, okay, that's cute.
[12286.10s -> 12287.79s]  Hold the sheep, hold the meat.
[12287.79s -> 12288.91s]  I think so.
[12288.91s -> 12300.55s]  I get another fish, then the whole thing changes.
[12300.55s -> 12302.35s]  Whoa, he did way more than I thought he was gonna do.
[12302.35s -> 12305.64s]  What was up with that?
[12305.64s -> 12310.27s]  He just did so much damage.
[12310.27s -> 12312.53s]  Oh, why did he do that much damage?
[12312.53s -> 12316.76s]  Oh, because he has meat on, shit, okay.
[12316.92s -> 12323.97s]  Well, first loss, that's the plan.
[12323.97s -> 12331.77s]  Go in, all right, I'm combining fish
[12331.77s -> 12339.24s]  and I'm going to go with sheep and dog.
[12339.24s -> 12354.82s]  Or do I go sheep, tell the otter, that dog now,
[12354.82s -> 12358.14s]  then sheep instead of,
[12358.14s -> 12362.50s]  I feel like the otter, this two, two is so good though.
[12362.50s -> 12379.73s]  Maybe the giraffe, maybe, only when you buy otters.
[12379.73s -> 12382.27s]  That's true, but giving somebody a two, two permanently
[12382.27s -> 12388.56s]  right now is a pretty big deal.
[12388.56s -> 12392.78s]  Well, let's put the meat bone on the dog
[12392.78s -> 12411.21s]  or meat bone on the fish or ant.
[12411.21s -> 12415.84s]  I like that, cause that's 10 damage right up front.
[12415.84s -> 12417.84s]  Let's roll, I got some more rolls to do it.
[12417.84s -> 12419.12s]  Let's see exactly what I'm talking about.
[12419.12s -> 12421.66s]  That's why I held onto him.
[12421.66s -> 12428.56s]  Cause this is, I mean, that's, I can't do it twice.
[12428.56s -> 12433.62s]  I can put the sheep out there and I'm gonna freeze the otter.
[12433.62s -> 12449.04s]  We'll put out the sheep and we'll roll.
[12449.04s -> 12455.74s]  All right, whatever, let's go.
[12455.74s -> 12462.36s]  Correct order, dog champ, please say dog
[12462.36s -> 12467.97s]  with a Boston accent, dog, dog, dog.
[12467.97s -> 12473.40s]  I don't know what you mean.
[12473.40s -> 12475.24s]  Now we're gonna play the otter
[12475.24s -> 12476.68s]  and then we can just probably sell the otter
[12476.68s -> 12478.12s]  after that maybe, it depends.
[12478.12s -> 12483.76s]  If I get another otter, that's a big deal.
[12483.76s -> 12486.72s]  That's annoying.
[12486.72s -> 12499.46s]  Say with a British accent, dog.
[12499.46s -> 12503.12s]  I needed fish too, fish would be a big deal as well.
[12503.12s -> 12506.69s]  All right, let's roll.
[12506.69s -> 12507.85s]  I like the dog probably.
[12507.85s -> 12508.85s]  I don't want the bone anymore.
[12508.85s -> 12517.05s]  Maybe get the bone to the fish.
[12517.05s -> 12523.20s]  I want fish, fish or dog again.
[12526.03s -> 12529.34s]  I'll take the sheep maybe.
[12529.34s -> 12535.44s]  Yeah, do this now, fuck.
[12535.44s -> 12553.56s]  Okay, say with a shpee accent, dog, dog.
[12554.28s -> 12555.96s]  If I can last a little bit longer,
[12555.96s -> 12563.12s]  I can level up a bunch of stuff.
[12563.12s -> 12567.92s]  Now let's go.
[12567.92s -> 12570.11s]  You have to have summons for the dog.
[12570.11s -> 12573.01s]  Yeah, but that fish gives one, one to everybody.
[12573.01s -> 12574.69s]  I really wanna, and he's nine, 10.
[12574.69s -> 12575.53s]  That's like the only thing
[12575.53s -> 12578.26s]  that's hurting anything right now.
[12578.26s -> 12582.23s]  Oh, come on now, really?
[12582.23s -> 12593.48s]  That actually just happened.
[12593.48s -> 12596.28s]  I'm gonna be close, but I've still got it.
[12596.28s -> 12597.28s]  Do I though?
[12597.28s -> 12599.31s]  I don't.
[12599.31s -> 12600.23s]  Shit, no, I do.
[12600.23s -> 12605.45s]  All right, I was gonna be really upset about that one.
[12605.45s -> 12609.26s]  No, no, accents.
[12609.26s -> 12613.00s]  I'm not doing any more accents.
[12613.00s -> 12618.20s]  I could pill ant,
[12618.20s -> 12620.54s]  and then I need some more summon stuff.
[12620.54s -> 12625.53s]  Cricket is a summon, but meh.
[12625.53s -> 12629.88s]  All right, all right, all right.
[12629.88s -> 12634.34s]  Now we're talking a little bit here.
[12634.34s -> 12640.15s]  Okay, okay, if I get a level two dog,
[12640.15s -> 12645.23s]  then this thing's gonna get fed and it's gonna be amazing.
[12645.23s -> 12657.31s]  I know I'm gonna do that, so just do it.
[12657.31s -> 12662.42s]  Do I just do this now?
[12662.42s -> 12677.13s]  Roll for another dog.
[12677.13s -> 12681.43s]  Yes, bingo, bingo.
[12681.43s -> 12685.04s]  Absolute bingo right here.
[12685.04s -> 12688.43s]  Hell yeah, all right.
[12688.43s -> 12694.14s]  Now, this is good too.
[12694.14s -> 12698.32s]  I'm gonna hold onto this.
[12698.32s -> 12701.94s]  Next round, we're gonna make a bunch of moves.
[12701.94s -> 12705.26s]  Okay, next round is a bunch of moves.
[12705.26s -> 12707.66s]  Dog is gonna get two two for every single person
[12707.66s -> 12711.07s]  that is summoned, which should be all right.
[12711.07s -> 12712.96s]  That should probably take us through
[12712.96s -> 12715.36s]  at least the next round or two.
[12715.36s -> 12718.41s]  Say that what you just said in a Brooklyn accent.
[12718.41s -> 12722.66s]  So I got the dog, I got a dog at level two,
[12722.66s -> 12727.39s]  and when the penguin comes up here,
[12727.39s -> 12728.43s]  I'll be drinking my coffee
[12728.43s -> 12730.61s]  and the penguin will fucking just annihilate everybody.
[12730.61s -> 12732.13s]  That's in a row, you know what I mean?
[12732.13s -> 12735.34s]  They can take people out in a row, it's pretty good.
[12735.34s -> 12740.45s]  I've only had two coffees, so I don't know.
[12740.45s -> 12746.82s]  Probably gonna have to have a third.
[12746.82s -> 12748.38s]  Say that again, but in a dog accent.
[12748.38s -> 12767.52s]  Okay, I think I lose.
[12767.52s -> 12770.36s]  Oh, it depends how, if I can get past this fish,
[12770.36s -> 12772.24s]  then it's over.
[12772.24s -> 12779.86s]  Nine, fuck, no.
[12779.86s -> 12784.80s]  Does Jerma do literally everything Chat asks him to?
[12784.80s -> 12786.88s]  Not everything, just a majority.
[12786.88s -> 12791.56s]  Okay, now I gotta sit here for a second
[12791.56s -> 12796.36s]  because this gives everybody one one.
[12796.36s -> 12797.96s]  I wanna make sure the right people are up there.
[12797.96s -> 12800.43s]  This is gonna give somebody a two two.
[12800.43s -> 12804.11s]  This one I sell, it gives somebody a four two.
[12804.11s -> 12808.25s]  So I need, what do I do first?
[12808.25s -> 12812.19s]  Because I'm selling you, so I'm gonna have to do that first.
[12812.19s -> 12820.05s]  Let's do that, because I know I'm doing that.
[12820.05s -> 12823.29s]  That's the best person it could have just happened to.
[12823.29s -> 12830.02s]  Now we bring the otter in, right?
[12830.02s -> 12831.48s]  Otter is in.
[12831.48s -> 12836.18s]  Oh my, you, okay, come on.
[12836.18s -> 12846.08s]  Keep this fish, do I keep the penguin?
[12846.08s -> 12850.00s]  I don't know if I keep the penguin, I need more summons.
[12850.04s -> 12860.36s]  I need some bees and shit.
[12860.36s -> 12865.16s]  Or do I just do fish and then put the penguin up?
[12865.16s -> 12869.24s]  Because everybody, I have three level twos.
[12869.24s -> 12871.31s]  All right, I'm gonna go for it.
[12871.31s -> 12880.68s]  Let's do penguin first, and then let's go with the fish.
[12880.68s -> 12890.51s]  Stupid ass parrot, really.
[12890.51s -> 12893.67s]  Everyone's gonna get one one, except for the sheep,
[12893.67s -> 12897.00s]  but that's okay.
[12897.00s -> 12902.07s]  Dog needs to go last, right?
[12902.07s -> 12907.16s]  Well, all right, I have another chance after this.
[12907.16s -> 12913.40s]  That's too bad, a level tier five, that sucks.
[12913.40s -> 12921.03s]  Parrot and dog maybe, wait, I'll try it.
[12921.03s -> 12934.74s]  Sheep can't be in the front, that looks good.
[12934.74s -> 12942.80s]  I think I'm okay, looks okay.
[12942.80s -> 12959.47s]  He's a lot of buffs, I need more summons, bad.
[12959.47s -> 12967.00s]  Otherwise that dog is not gonna, shit, this is bad.
[12967.00s -> 12977.21s]  Very bad, very bad, I need more summons.
[12977.21s -> 12982.07s]  Damn it, this like turned out, this started so well.
[12982.07s -> 12987.72s]  I gotta get rid of the otter and the penguin probably.
[12987.72s -> 12994.95s]  No, I need somebody that summons shit.
[12994.95s -> 13003.88s]  Parrot the sheep, could parrot the sheep,
[13003.88s -> 13007.00s]  but let's do, I mean, this is just a no-brainer.
[13007.00s -> 13012.80s]  Let's roll for another sheep, and we got it.
[13012.80s -> 13014.32s]  And okay, this is good, this is perfect.
[13014.32s -> 13017.55s]  We're gonna parrot the sheep,
[13017.55s -> 13023.97s]  unless something crazy comes up.
[13023.97s -> 13027.88s]  That's not crazy, so here we go.
[13027.88s -> 13029.06s]  Let's get rid of the otter.
[13029.06s -> 13031.99s]  Should I get rid of the otter or the penguin?
[13031.99s -> 13046.08s]  Probably the otter, okay.
[13046.08s -> 13048.24s]  So now I get double the summons, it's gonna be two, four,
[13048.24s -> 13052.07s]  four rams, I'm gonna hold onto this food.
[13052.07s -> 13053.33s]  Hold onto both foods actually,
[13053.33s -> 13054.79s]  and see if I can get something good for the next round.
[13054.79s -> 13059.80s]  I have to survive this round.
[13059.80s -> 13065.53s]  No, I can't, why would I freeze that if I die, it's over.
[13065.53s -> 13071.23s]  Okay, well, this is it.
[13071.23s -> 13075.86s]  I think everyone's in the place that it possibly can be in.
[13075.86s -> 13076.70s]  We just hope that, I have to hope
[13076.70s -> 13081.57s]  that the dog can get buffed up.
[13081.57s -> 13083.09s]  There won't be enough room for the rams.
[13083.09s -> 13087.52s]  Should I move them back, like this?
[13087.52s -> 13096.50s]  I think that's the play, otherwise, yeah, I won't fit.
[13096.50s -> 13115.12s]  Okay, good luck, cute, darkest dungeon.
[13115.12s -> 13121.60s]  This is a victory, I get to go another time.
[13121.60s -> 13127.99s]  Oof, yes, I can, I think, unless that ox causes a problem,
[13130.18s -> 13140.19s]  which I think I'm fine, because here it comes again.
[13140.19s -> 13149.28s]  Nice, okay, we're good.
[13149.28s -> 13165.52s]  Darkest dungeon for kids.
[13165.52s -> 13175.62s]  I think I just throw this whole thing away.
[13175.62s -> 13189.66s]  I think it's, who am I gonna replace, the penguin?
[13189.66s -> 13192.68s]  It's too late, yeah, it's way too late.
[13192.68s -> 13196.23s]  Okay, the penguin gives three people one-one.
[13196.23s -> 13199.65s]  This is him giving himself one-one if he eats food.
[13199.65s -> 13201.57s]  It's just spread out more.
[13201.57s -> 13207.57s]  No, I gotta throw the whole thing away.
[13211.02s -> 13219.99s]  The whale could eat the parrot after he copies this, right?
[13219.99s -> 13224.74s]  So then we'd get, okay, whale the parrot,
[13224.74s -> 13226.66s]  because the parrot copies this.
[13226.66s -> 13236.42s]  This is gonna happen first.
[13236.42s -> 13238.28s]  Yeah, this is start of battle, swallow friend.
[13238.28s -> 13240.20s]  This is end turn, so he does this first.
[13240.20s -> 13244.02s]  Parrot does it first.
[13244.02s -> 13251.70s]  Use the can first, yeah, absolutely.
[13251.70s -> 13256.76s]  So if I get rid of the penguin, will this actually work?
[13256.76s -> 13267.64s]  I'm kinda curious, let's find out.
[13267.64s -> 13270.06s]  Because you're gonna copy your moves.
[13270.06s -> 13271.44s]  You're gonna die, become two.
[13271.44s -> 13272.72s]  You're gonna die, become two.
[13272.72s -> 13286.96s]  He's gonna spit you out, you're gonna die and become two.
[13286.96s -> 13289.80s]  Wait, the whale goes first.
[13289.80s -> 13295.14s]  Oh, wait a minute, yeah.
[13295.14s -> 13296.62s]  That's at the start of the battle,
[13296.62s -> 13298.70s]  so he's gonna eat him, he's gonna turn.
[13298.70s -> 13303.07s]  I think it still is more.
[13303.07s -> 13307.52s]  Okay, well, let's just go.
[13307.52s -> 13323.10s]  Jesus, am I actually gonna, I have to survive.
[13323.14s -> 13334.59s]  I think we just do sushi and just hope for the best.
[13334.59s -> 13337.95s]  Oh, I could put parrot in too.
[13337.95s -> 13339.59s]  Sushi gives three one ones.
[13339.59s -> 13342.21s]  This will give the parrot up to what?
[13342.21s -> 13345.26s]  Like a seven something, eight something?
[13345.26s -> 13348.35s]  I think that's actually better, yeah.
[13348.35s -> 13350.71s]  Eight seven's better.
[13350.71s -> 13351.63s]  We can save this next turn.
[13351.63s -> 13352.67s]  All right, if I survive,
[13352.67s -> 13362.26s]  then this is gonna be a pretty good turn.
[13362.26s -> 13366.94s]  Oh, hold on, I could've got rid of the whale.
[13366.94s -> 13369.44s]  The parrot copies the other parrot.
[13370.44s -> 13373.82s]  Does that work?
[13373.82s -> 13377.29s]  If I had put the parrot here, a second parrot,
[13377.29s -> 13380.61s]  would that have been he copies this person
[13381.61s -> 13383.80s]  or would he copy nothing?
[13383.80s -> 13385.00s]  Would the parrot copy nothing
[13385.00s -> 13388.54s]  and then this parrot copy something?
[13388.54s -> 13396.31s]  Oh well, let's just go.
[13396.31s -> 13397.43s]  It actually does work, oh,
[13397.43s -> 13402.46s]  because it goes right to left.
[13402.46s -> 13409.58s]  This might not be a loss.
[13409.58s -> 13421.58s]  I think I still win, possible.
[13421.58s -> 13428.15s]  Yeah, I definitely win.
[13428.15s -> 13430.23s]  Although this elephant's gotta fucking die right now
[13430.23s -> 13432.82s]  because he's puffing these things up like crazy.
[13432.82s -> 13445.25s]  Kill this thing.
[13445.25s -> 13447.69s]  Come on, there it is.
[13447.69s -> 13452.51s]  All right, here it comes, the two.
[13452.51s -> 13454.05s]  Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[13454.05s -> 13456.54s]  Wait just a second.
[13456.54s -> 13462.71s]  Wait just a second, what's going on here?
[13462.71s -> 13466.25s]  Why did he copy, why did that happen for?
[13467.25s -> 13470.44s]  It turns it into a normal parrot?
[13470.44s -> 13472.00s]  So when he eats something,
[13472.00s -> 13478.09s]  he just removes anything that was on it before?
[13478.09s -> 13485.09s]  Oh man, it makes an entirely new animal.
[13485.09s -> 13489.67s]  So it's all, okay, it's death was triggered,
[13489.67s -> 13491.75s]  which means it's a new parrot that comes out
[13491.75s -> 13498.33s]  that did not copy anything, please.
[13498.33s -> 13502.48s]  All right, last one, one more, I'm done.
[13502.48s -> 13513.92s]  Last one, this is it, this game's fun.
[13513.92s -> 13517.02s]  And you know what the best part about this game is?
[13517.02s -> 13519.58s]  I know that like, okay, Hearthstone Battlegrounds I love.
[13519.58s -> 13522.09s]  I used to play it all the time.
[13522.09s -> 13525.22s]  Obviously I haven't really played it recently at all.
[13525.22s -> 13526.70s]  But I like the fact that,
[13526.70s -> 13529.47s]  I don't know how this matchmaking works,
[13529.47s -> 13534.84s]  but the fact that I can just sit here for an hour
[13534.84s -> 13540.31s]  and not even do anything.
[13540.31s -> 13546.45s]  I don't understand how the matchmaking works.
[13546.45s -> 13551.80s]  All right, well, I think we're just gonna pick this team.
[13551.80s -> 13559.09s]  Skeeto's fine early.
[13559.09s -> 13568.15s]  I think I'm gonna roll, good thing I did.
[13568.15s -> 13572.57s]  How about the obese posers, the obese feet,
[13572.57s -> 13579.26s]  the skilled feet, the skilled posers,
[13579.26s -> 13585.46s]  obese posers, that's so stupid.
[13585.46s -> 13595.45s]  The fussy piggies, you already buffed that, how?
[13595.45s -> 13612.32s]  Ooh, that's huge, that's bad.
[13612.32s -> 13613.78s]  Game's results are predetermined from the start.
[13613.78s -> 13616.93s]  You just watch it unfold before your eyes.
[13616.93s -> 13619.81s]  How is it matchmaking people?
[13619.81s -> 13621.73s]  Is it just based on how many trophies
[13621.73s -> 13622.65s]  and how many hearts you have
[13622.65s -> 13624.09s]  and it just finds somebody else
[13624.09s -> 13632.04s]  that has that amount of hearts and trophies?
[13632.04s -> 13638.10s]  That's a really cool way to do this.
[13638.10s -> 13642.69s]  It's by turn, if you're on the same turn.
[13642.69s -> 13647.66s]  That's kind of cool,
[13647.66s -> 13650.02s]  because it really doesn't even matter
[13650.02s -> 13655.81s]  when you press the button.
[13655.81s -> 13657.75s]  These are old teams from the past that are saved.
[13657.75s -> 13664.21s]  These aren't live, really?
[13664.21s -> 13672.44s]  So they're ghosts of other teams
[13672.44s -> 13674.80s]  that would explain the lack of timer.
[13674.80s -> 13683.60s]  That's really, really actually, that's really cool.
[13683.60s -> 13687.51s]  There's always like a saved team somewhere.
[13687.51s -> 13689.31s]  Someone is losing to you right now
[13689.31s -> 13697.56s]  or beating you from like yesterday or like an hour ago.
[13697.56s -> 13704.32s]  That's some pretty big brain game development right there.
[13704.32s -> 13705.52s]  What do I wanna do?
[13705.52s -> 13715.12s]  I think I'm throwing this whole hand away, good.
[13716.24s -> 13719.85s]  Excuse me, hold on a second.
[13719.85s -> 13723.20s]  I've right-clicked and dragged.
[13723.20s -> 13727.76s]  I swear to God, I swear on everything.
[13727.76s -> 13731.20s]  You even saw me hesitate.
[13731.20s -> 13732.20s]  I hesitated and I was like,
[13732.20s -> 13733.68s]  wait, I wanna make sure I'm right-clicking
[13733.68s -> 13735.68s]  and I right-clicked and dragged.
[13735.68s -> 13739.94s]  It's not, it doesn't matter.
[13739.94s -> 13747.74s]  Oh yeah, okay, well, let's, now I have to buy a beaver.
[13747.74s -> 13750.68s]  I need, I need stats.
[13750.68s -> 13752.04s]  I just, I have to buy the duck too.
[13752.04s -> 13762.84s]  Like I need stats now, I'm screwed.
[13762.84s -> 13763.96s]  Single click and move them
[13763.96s -> 13770.18s]  if you're worried about them mixing.
[13770.18s -> 13771.06s]  This team is awful.
[13771.06s -> 13772.26s]  Well, it's about to be pretty good
[13772.26s -> 13789.17s]  because I'm gonna sell the duck immediately.
[13789.17s -> 13796.86s]  God damn it, I think I still would have lost.
[13796.86s -> 13803.49s]  We're doing that for sure, because I want the peacock.
[13803.49s -> 13808.54s]  Peacock, I'm gonna combine the beaver, I think,
[13808.54s -> 13820.10s]  or just sell, see what I get.
[13820.10s -> 13825.54s]  Very nice, all is not lost.
[13825.54s -> 13835.84s]  Yes, it is.
[13835.84s -> 13838.20s]  Heal attack damage to adjacent pets.
[13838.20s -> 13848.32s]  That sucks, it needs to be last.
[13848.32s -> 13851.00s]  The badger in the back?
[13851.00s -> 13871.00s]  Combine the beavers, put the badger in the back.
[13874.48s -> 13879.48s]  No, did you fart?
[13889.15s -> 13891.13s]  Worst voice.
[13891.13s -> 13895.24s]  Speaking of worst voice, the nominees are gonna open up
[13895.24s -> 13899.57s]  probably in like a week or two, maybe like two weeks.
[13899.57s -> 13902.73s]  For you to nominate things for worst and best of the year,
[13902.73s -> 13905.64s]  you'll have some categories to look through.
[13905.64s -> 13908.52s]  Categories will be known in advance.
[13908.52s -> 13919.50s]  I'm hoping for the first week of December.
[13919.50s -> 13932.63s]  Finally, victory, crying out loud.
[13932.63s -> 13936.19s]  I didn't see the last part, apparently.
[13936.19s -> 13941.63s]  Kill the ant, hopefully it goes to, all right.
[13941.63s -> 13945.60s]  I'm gonna sell the mosquito.
[13945.60s -> 13946.44s]  Let me roll.
[13946.44s -> 13950.03s]  Sell the mosquito, kill the ant,
[13950.03s -> 13954.54s]  hope it lands on the peacock.
[13954.54s -> 13957.08s]  Sell the mosquito, sell the beaver.
[13957.08s -> 13963.64s]  But then I'm killing everybody.
[13963.64s -> 13966.55s]  All right, I know I'm selling the mosquito.
[13966.55s -> 13969.73s]  I sell the beaver, hopefully it gives it the health to him.
[13969.73s -> 13973.02s]  Sell your kidneys.
[13973.02s -> 13976.93s]  This sucks, but I kinda have to do it.
[13976.93s -> 13983.00s]  Shit, no more crabs.
[13983.00s -> 13985.59s]  Oh, the elephant, shit, you're right.
[13985.59s -> 13987.07s]  All right, we're good.
[13987.07s -> 13991.31s]  Okay, sell the beaver.
[13991.31s -> 13994.24s]  That sucks, but whatever.
[13994.24s -> 13998.82s]  Okay, now, I'm gonna have to pick, oh shit, okay.
[13998.82s -> 14008.72s]  Is this stupid, what I'm doing?
[14008.72s -> 14013.12s]  Do I just buy the swan?
[14013.12s -> 14015.75s]  Or should I roll for something better?
[14015.75s -> 14023.21s]  Crab on the peacock, swan it up.
[14023.21s -> 14025.38s]  It would be an eight health crab.
[14025.38s -> 14030.05s]  Yeah, that's probably better for right now.
[14030.05s -> 14031.96s]  I am gonna, no I'm not.
[14042.99s -> 14055.64s]  I could just, okay, I got an idea.
[14055.64s -> 14059.02s]  Why do I have a sus command?
[14059.02s -> 14064.12s]  Because I've, okay, I've been around,
[14064.12s -> 14065.48s]  it's not Among Us.
[14065.48s -> 14069.60s]  Before Among Us, I did a thing like five years ago.
[14069.60s -> 14072.67s]  I don't even know how to explain this.
[14072.67s -> 14074.75s]  It's part of a game, it's part of a game called Sorcery.
[14074.75s -> 14102.42s]  Steve, okay, well, it's, I have not lost or won anything.
[14102.42s -> 14104.91s]  What do we got?
[14104.91s -> 14106.87s]  I know that's gonna happen.
[14106.87s -> 14112.44s]  Wait, okay, so if I give this to the peacock,
[14112.44s -> 14115.44s]  if he doesn't actually take the damage,
[14115.44s -> 14120.23s]  that means he doesn't get the buff, right?
[14120.23s -> 14122.65s]  If I garlic the peacock,
[14122.65s -> 14126.59s]  it's not technically gonna get hurt.
[14126.59s -> 14127.71s]  Needs to be hurt, right?
[14127.71s -> 14129.03s]  So wouldn't it go to zero,
[14129.03s -> 14132.48s]  because he does one damage.
[14132.48s -> 14138.48s]  It doesn't any hurt, it has to be a minimum of one damage.
[14138.48s -> 14142.10s]  Garlic blocks to a minimum of one damage, not to zero.
[14142.94s -> 14145.53s]  That's not what it says.
[14145.53s -> 14148.17s]  Will always do at least one, even with garlic.
[14148.17s -> 14157.81s]  Okay, now the question is,
[14157.81s -> 14161.24s]  I don't really want the rabbit.
[14161.24s -> 14162.72s]  Do I want the food?
[14162.72s -> 14169.95s]  All right, let's see what happens.
[14169.95s -> 14188.44s]  Okay, I need another unit though, don't I?
[14188.44s -> 14192.10s]  That will make him a eight.
[14192.10s -> 14214.84s]  It doesn't, makes him an eight, eight.
[14214.84s -> 14218.54s]  I think I got this one.
[14218.54s -> 14222.05s]  That's wonderful, actually, what just happened.
[14222.05s -> 14231.76s]  That was unbelievable what just happened.
[14231.76s -> 14234.02s]  All right, well, he's gonna die regardless,
[14234.02s -> 14241.20s]  but at least he'll kill the whale.
[14241.20s -> 14246.83s]  Shit, it's okay though.
[14247.79s -> 14251.70s]  Turns out the crab was a great, oh, that's bad.
[14251.70s -> 14260.55s]  Ooh, oh, that's actually pretty good,
[14260.55s -> 14262.23s]  because it does its attack damage to,
[14262.23s -> 14264.19s]  now it makes sense as to why you use this.
[14264.19s -> 14269.37s]  I thought this thing was terrible.
[14269.37s -> 14278.76s]  All right, puffer fish.
[14278.76s -> 14280.88s]  Okay, if this guy gets to level two,
[14280.88s -> 14285.11s]  he does one damage to two things behind him.
[14285.11s -> 14286.79s]  So the puffer fish would make sense,
[14286.79s -> 14300.23s]  but I need another elephant to be on the badger.
[14300.23s -> 14308.81s]  I'm gonna stop freezing this guy.
[14308.81s -> 14315.44s]  I need an elephant or a honey, but I'm out of money.
[14315.44s -> 14322.82s]  So I think I'm just gonna have to, I'm not sure.
[14323.14s -> 14338.48s]  Should I just feed the badger and put the puffer up?
[14338.48s -> 14341.35s]  But he's only gonna hit one behind,
[14341.35s -> 14345.29s]  and the crab needs to copy the peacock.
[14345.29s -> 14347.09s]  The peacock is the one that gets the most benefit
[14347.09s -> 14350.30s]  from getting hit by this.
[14350.30s -> 14351.94s]  Okay, if I do this, I just have to really hope
[14351.94s -> 14354.56s]  that I get a second elephant.
[14354.56s -> 14366.60s]  That's what this whole thing is based around.
[14366.60s -> 14368.84s]  All right, well, I'm gonna feed the badger,
[14368.84s -> 14374.19s]  because that's six damage,
[14374.19s -> 14376.74s]  and I'm just gonna have to see if this works.
[14376.74s -> 14379.71s]  Put the puffer in the front.
[14379.71s -> 14384.79s]  I feel like he's just gonna die instantly,
[14384.79s -> 14386.87s]  because you have to get hurt and stay alive.
[14386.87s -> 14392.62s]  If you die, you don't get to do it.
[14392.62s -> 14401.82s]  Yeah, it has to be like this.
[14401.82s -> 14403.70s]  All right, well, hopefully I get a,
[14403.70s -> 14406.57s]  I have nine health.
[14406.57s -> 14410.47s]  I just have to hope that I get another elephant.
[14410.47s -> 14412.47s]  Another elephant, this is much better.
[14412.47s -> 14425.14s]  It looks really good, actually.
[14425.14s -> 14432.04s]  Well, at least that dies.
[14432.04s -> 14436.83s]  Very good, very good.
[14436.83s -> 14438.89s]  But is it good enough?
[14438.89s -> 14439.71s]  Is it good enough?
[14439.71s -> 14452.50s]  It is.
[14452.50s -> 14456.61s]  Give me an elephant, give me another elephant.
[14456.61s -> 14465.84s]  Give me another elephant or another puffer.
[14465.84s -> 14477.11s]  I should garlic the puffer.
[14477.11s -> 14480.50s]  Elephant, elephant.
[14480.50s -> 14482.78s]  Shit, damn it.
[14482.78s -> 14487.21s]  No, crab?
[14487.25s -> 14489.45s]  Would this potentially triple?
[14489.45s -> 14491.05s]  What happens if this does not upgrade
[14491.05s -> 14499.46s]  when leveling, nevermind, okay.
[14499.46s -> 14516.87s]  I think it's just be the badger,
[14516.87s -> 14518.51s]  because that's gonna do seven damage.
[14518.51s -> 14521.25s]  I'm just trying to win attrition here.
[14521.25s -> 14523.26s]  I'm trying just to stay alive,
[14523.26s -> 14526.20s]  so I can really level up the elephant.
[14526.20s -> 14527.08s]  So if everything dies,
[14527.08s -> 14529.60s]  but at least it kills the last thing,
[14529.60s -> 14533.40s]  I wanna make sure it can.
[14533.40s -> 14536.42s]  Well, kill that monkey in the back, come on.
[14536.42s -> 14544.13s]  Again, shit, sorry.
[14544.13s -> 14546.21s]  Brutal, that's bad, but it's okay.
[14546.21s -> 14550.86s]  I think it's still, yep, I'm good.
[14550.86s -> 14560.37s]  Badger stays alive.
[14560.37s -> 14563.26s]  Nice, very nice.
[14563.26s -> 14565.20s]  Finally, elephant.
[14565.20s -> 14571.31s]  Then he'll be doing damage to two people behind him.
[14571.31s -> 14572.71s]  Turkey, I don't have anything.
[14572.71s -> 14576.88s]  I just don't have anything that's good enough for it.
[14576.88s -> 14586.95s]  All right, I have no summons really.
[14586.95s -> 14595.20s]  I'll take it.
[14595.20s -> 14596.52s]  Place the crab with the turkey.
[14596.52s -> 14599.12s]  I don't think so, nothing's summoned.
[14599.12s -> 14608.09s]  I don't have any summons.
[14608.09s -> 14610.93s]  Oh, there's honey for the badger, right?
[14610.93s -> 14612.03s]  Do I wanna do that?
[14612.03s -> 14619.97s]  I think that's what I wanna do,
[14619.97s -> 14626.88s]  because then, ooh, I want that too.
[14626.88s -> 14632.01s]  Who do I replace?
[14632.01s -> 14636.78s]  I don't think I can even take the monkey.
[14636.78s -> 14641.29s]  I like this team.
[14641.29s -> 14646.71s]  Well, we'll find out.
[14646.71s -> 14650.58s]  Now this is gonna get very interesting.
[14650.58s -> 14651.42s]  I need to start scaling.
[14651.42s -> 14665.04s]  Yeah, that's true, nice.
[14665.04s -> 14675.80s]  At least you gotta do it once, bad.
[14675.80s -> 14677.16s]  Crab has been carrying.
[14677.16s -> 14680.12s]  Look at what the crab's been doing here.
[14680.12s -> 14683.40s]  Oh, come on.
[14683.40s -> 14686.76s]  No, shit, it hit the wrong person.
[14686.76s -> 14691.28s]  Oh no.
[14691.28s -> 14703.72s]  Oh well.
[14703.72s -> 14706.99s]  I think I have to replace the badger.
[14706.99s -> 14708.91s]  Crab has been doing so well.
[14708.91s -> 14723.36s]  He's a nine, 10.
[14723.36s -> 14727.63s]  Crab's gonna start to fall off.
[14727.63s -> 14731.04s]  It's the badger and crab for the monkey and the elephant.
[14731.04s -> 14738.05s]  Really start growing your front three.
[14738.81s -> 14740.25s]  Maybe it is time to get rid of the crab
[14740.25s -> 14743.10s]  and just put the monkey out.
[14743.10s -> 14745.15s]  Yeah, it's probably the play.
[14750.16s -> 14761.25s]  So then he'll be constantly giving the elephant tutu.
[14761.25s -> 14762.17s]  Keep you in the back.
[14762.17s -> 14763.39s]  All right, let's feed the elephant.
[14763.39s -> 14764.65s]  No, actually, not yet.
[14764.65s -> 14771.68s]  They might be better food.
[14771.68s -> 14777.80s]  I, okay.
[14777.80s -> 14781.08s]  I don't know if I wanna do this right now,
[14781.08s -> 14784.65s]  because I think I wanna give the cupcake to the elephant.
[14784.65s -> 14801.72s]  I don't wanna lose.
[14801.72s -> 14802.88s]  The elephant has to survive
[14802.88s -> 14809.00s]  with the peacock upgrade to even matter.
[14809.00s -> 14814.04s]  Camel might be a good replacement with the...
[14814.08s -> 14818.66s]  All right, wait a minute.
[14818.66s -> 14819.54s]  Camel gets hit.
[14819.54s -> 14822.68s]  It gives one, two to the person behind,
[14822.68s -> 14826.31s]  which is the peacock, which gets two.
[14826.31s -> 14830.69s]  So it would be giving every time the elephant attacks,
[14830.69s -> 14834.34s]  the peacock would be getting three, two
[14834.34s -> 14839.00s]  every time the elephant attacks,
[14839.00s -> 14845.15s]  which that's kind of insane.
[14845.15s -> 14860.70s]  I'm gonna go for it.
[14860.70s -> 14862.53s]  Two gold.
[14862.53s -> 14867.49s]  Do I freeze the cupcake?
[14867.49s -> 14870.97s]  All right, we got something else to hold on to.
[14870.97s -> 14875.64s]  Really?
[14875.64s -> 14880.23s]  Oh, it's too late for the scorpion,
[14880.23s -> 14884.44s]  unless I wanna get rid of the monkey.
[14884.56s -> 14885.52s]  The cupcake is temporary,
[14885.52s -> 14892.49s]  but at this stage, I probably need it to scale.
[14892.49s -> 14895.96s]  Actually, the salad does kind of suck right now.
[14895.96s -> 14897.46s]  It's never too late for the scorpion.
[14897.46s -> 14898.70s]  Yeah, but who do I replace?
[14898.70s -> 14900.54s]  The monkey?
[14900.54s -> 14902.02s]  I feel like the monkey needs to be here for a few turns
[14902.02s -> 14911.06s]  for him to be worth even buying in the first place.
[14911.06s -> 14913.40s]  Yeah, I don't think I even care about this.
[14913.40s -> 14915.56s]  It's too late now.
[14915.56s -> 14923.36s]  I'm going with this as this meta here.
[14923.36s -> 14929.65s]  I have to hope that the peacock just goes absolutely crazy.
[14929.65s -> 14931.20s]  All right, there we go.
[14931.20s -> 14936.81s]  It should see at least a few hits.
[14936.81s -> 14938.50s]  Here it is.
[14938.50s -> 14941.27s]  Boom, boom.
[14941.27s -> 14942.91s]  It's gonna kill the...
[14942.95s -> 14945.10s]  All right, nice, perfect.
[14945.10s -> 14947.12s]  That counts though, cause it was alive.
[14947.12s -> 14947.96s]  Does it not count?
[14947.96s -> 14950.64s]  It was alive when it happened though, right?
[14950.64s -> 14954.83s]  Does it not count?
[14954.83s -> 14956.98s]  Oh, this is perfect.
[14956.98s -> 14961.22s]  Am I gonna be able to kill the dog because of this?
[14961.22s -> 14963.30s]  Oh, come on, no.
[14963.30s -> 14964.92s]  Damn it.
[14964.92s -> 14966.81s]  Get that shit out of here.
[14971.90s -> 14983.00s]  Oh well, I think I still lost anyways.
[14983.00s -> 14987.79s]  Well, I can't die again.
[14987.79s -> 14989.24s]  Aye, aye, aye.
[14989.24s -> 14995.57s]  Oh, this is a certain play here.
[14995.57s -> 14999.52s]  Gain four attack.
[14999.52s -> 15009.51s]  Why a tier one pet give all friends one one?
[15009.51s -> 15019.98s]  Elephant, elephant.
[15020.02s -> 15025.19s]  Maybe get rid of the badger.
[15025.19s -> 15026.23s]  Freeze the dragon maybe.
[15026.23s -> 15030.35s]  All right, elephant, cupcake on elephant.
[15030.35s -> 15038.20s]  Do double elephant?
[15038.20s -> 15040.44s]  Get rid of a badger.
[15040.44s -> 15045.66s]  Go with just double elephant.
[15045.66s -> 15048.80s]  I think so.
[15048.80s -> 15051.85s]  Go for a camel upgrade.
[15051.85s -> 15055.40s]  Wait, wouldn't double elephant not make any sense?
[15055.40s -> 15057.69s]  Because it has to attack.
[15057.69s -> 15061.52s]  So wouldn't I just be hitting my own elephant?
[15061.52s -> 15065.65s]  I don't think that's a good idea.
[15065.65s -> 15069.23s]  I mean, I could upgrade the elephant again.
[15069.23s -> 15074.40s]  That uses all my money.
[15074.40s -> 15088.29s]  I don't know, I almost kind of want to look for the camel.
[15088.29s -> 15090.39s]  I wonder if I should try to upgrade the elephant
[15090.39s -> 15095.88s]  or should I just roll everything and look for the camel?
[15095.88s -> 15097.00s]  Where is it to level the elephant?
[15097.00s -> 15100.76s]  I have to survive though.
[15100.76s -> 15108.95s]  Whatever.
[15108.95s -> 15111.59s]  Okay, all right.
[15111.59s -> 15116.74s]  All right, we're going to do this
[15116.74s -> 15129.84s]  and just hope for the best.
[15129.84s -> 15138.67s]  Is it enough?
[15138.67s -> 15149.29s]  Hey, it's at least enough to do it twice and go.
[15149.29s -> 15152.24s]  Come on, get that shit out of here.
[15152.24s -> 15155.75s]  Do I lose?
[15155.75s -> 15160.07s]  I think it's still, let's see, seven, seven times.
[15166.95s -> 15167.79s]  Damn it.
[15167.79s -> 15172.02s]  No, I only had two wins.
[15172.02s -> 15172.94s]  All right, one more.
[15172.94s -> 15175.28s]  This is actually the last one, I promise.
[15175.28s -> 15193.06s]  Last one.
[15193.06s -> 15196.70s]  I'm going with this.
[15196.70s -> 15202.38s]  The leaking soup, the inedible bush.
[15202.38s -> 15208.38s]  Inedible bushes, inedible soup.
[15208.38s -> 15218.10s]  Leaking package, leaking packages.
[15218.10s -> 15231.20s]  That's okay.
[15231.20s -> 15233.79s]  Let chat play.
[15233.79s -> 15241.34s]  It's a games free, you can play right now.
[15241.34s -> 15242.66s]  I was going to say if I didn't win this,
[15242.66s -> 15245.42s]  or if I didn't turn this into a draw,
[15245.42s -> 15263.00s]  this is going to, I don't know, I'm not happy.
[15263.00s -> 15265.68s]  Here we go.
[15265.68s -> 15277.92s]  Okay, hold on a minute here.
[15277.92s -> 15280.67s]  Remember, stop losing.
[15280.67s -> 15294.42s]  I'm still learning.
[15294.42s -> 15295.98s]  Why do you have a four, five duck?
[15295.98s -> 15298.98s]  What happened?
[15299.02s -> 15333.50s]  You have a four, five duck?
[15333.50s -> 15342.04s]  Okay, and then maybe a spider.
[15342.04s -> 15347.32s]  Spider in front, probably of the kangaroo.
[15347.32s -> 15353.24s]  And I can't wait to get rid of this duck.
[15353.24s -> 15358.57s]  Okay, good, let's go.
[15358.57s -> 15364.07s]  Nice, very nice.
[15364.07s -> 15365.95s]  Don't talk with food in your mouth.
[15365.95s -> 15369.36s]  All right, can't wait for the next six
[15369.36s -> 15373.86s]  super auto pet streams.
[15373.86s -> 15378.83s]  I mean, this game is just, passes time very, very easily.
[15378.83s -> 15384.45s]  It takes 15 seconds to open this and get in a game.
[15384.45s -> 15386.15s]  It's not like I wouldn't ever play it again,
[15386.15s -> 15388.07s]  but I don't know.
[15388.07s -> 15394.08s]  I think it's fun.
[15394.08s -> 15404.35s]  Very good.
[15405.03s -> 15408.75s]  Let's go ahead and get this out of the way.
[15408.75s -> 15411.34s]  All right, turtle is, okay.
[15411.34s -> 15418.44s]  Sell the duck, turtle going up.
[15418.44s -> 15421.38s]  And I want turtle to go in front of the kangaroo.
[15421.38s -> 15422.22s]  No, I don't.
[15422.22s -> 15431.22s]  Who do I want the turtle to go in front of?
[15431.22s -> 15434.14s]  I think I want to do, okay, hold on.
[15434.14s -> 15445.37s]  In front of the spider, but I think I need to, I don't know.
[15445.37s -> 15451.70s]  Sell the cricket or, and crab.
[15451.70s -> 15456.15s]  Yeah, but he has the five damage on him though.
[15456.15s -> 15457.15s]  Is he even being funny?
[15457.15s -> 15459.19s]  Dude, yeah, the reason why I'm so tired is I just,
[15459.19s -> 15464.19s]  I did a, I just did a three hour nonstop standup routine.
[15464.19s -> 15466.33s]  Just like kind of chilling now.
[15466.37s -> 15478.16s]  I'm exhausted.
[15482.45s -> 15485.78s]  Kangaroo has to see somebody in front of him attack.
[15485.78s -> 15487.86s]  Turtle, when it dies,
[15487.86s -> 15491.45s]  it gives melon armor to the person behind it.
[15491.45s -> 15495.86s]  I guess it'd have to be here.
[15495.86s -> 15498.71s]  And then I want to do this.
[15498.71s -> 15517.13s]  This is stupid, probably, but maybe.
[15517.13s -> 15521.25s]  This is stupid, but whatever.
[15521.25s -> 15523.07s]  Melon, oh, that's right.
[15523.07s -> 15527.79s]  Melon armor, it cancels because it's its own thing.
[15535.54s -> 15537.28s]  Well, I'm kind of screwed now.
[15537.28s -> 15543.85s]  I think I have to do this or do this.
[15543.85s -> 15545.25s]  Then the kangaroo doesn't give very much benefit.
[15545.49s -> 15553.76s]  Yeah, I messed this up a little bit.
[15553.76s -> 15554.76s]  Okay, so then he can hit.
[15554.76s -> 15557.30s]  Yeah, that makes more sense.
[15557.30s -> 15560.75s]  All right, let's go.
[15560.75s -> 15562.47s]  The spider will get to hit at least,
[15562.47s -> 15563.71s]  I'm going to lose the bee,
[15563.71s -> 15574.43s]  but it's being replaced by swinging at least twice.
[15574.43s -> 15576.03s]  I've been streaming for four and a half hours.
[15576.03s -> 15577.39s]  What the fuck is going on here?
[15577.39s -> 15593.56s]  I was supposed to be live for like 45 minutes.
[15593.56s -> 15602.74s]  Yeah, that's, that's good.
[15602.74s -> 15607.91s]  All right, that's two wins.
[15607.91s -> 15613.86s]  Okay, thinking about, let's upgrade the spider,
[15613.86s -> 15624.72s]  sell the ant, sell the ant, upgrade spider.
[15624.72s -> 15626.28s]  I don't think anyone's leaving right now,
[15626.28s -> 15629.16s]  although hold on.
[15630.16s -> 15635.21s]  Let me just make sure no one else is leaving.
[15635.21s -> 15637.21s]  Or I could pill the turtle
[15637.21s -> 15653.12s]  and then they get permanent melon armor.
[15653.12s -> 15656.74s]  That's not bad.
[15656.74s -> 15657.58s]  That works, right?
[15657.58s -> 15662.14s]  And then the spider will have a melon armor forever.
[15662.14s -> 15668.80s]  I can pill the ant later, the pill will show up again.
[15668.80s -> 15671.36s]  You'll sell the spider in not too long from now though.
[15671.36s -> 15680.02s]  Will I, even if I upgrade them,
[15680.02s -> 15684.24s]  pill the turtle on the kangaroo?
[15684.24s -> 15690.93s]  That's not a bad idea.
[15690.93s -> 15698.29s]  I like that idea.
[15698.29s -> 15701.64s]  Want to do this or do I?
[15701.64s -> 15711.23s]  Let's roll.
[15711.23s -> 15712.67s]  Hold on to this in case I lose.
[15712.67s -> 15717.50s]  What do I want to do here?
[15717.50s -> 15740.80s]  Swan, I could do Swan and level up.
[15740.84s -> 15748.43s]  Interesting, nice.
[15748.43s -> 15749.35s]  Very, very nice.
[15749.35s -> 15750.47s]  I'm really happy about that.
[15750.47s -> 15766.59s]  All right, let's go.
[15766.59s -> 15767.43s]  This is going to be bad.
[15767.43s -> 15782.44s]  I should have had the cricket go first.
[15782.44s -> 15786.83s]  Hey, very nice.
[15786.83s -> 15789.63s]  It's not going to be enough, I don't think.
[15789.63s -> 15803.10s]  Let's see, it is not.
[15803.10s -> 15808.16s]  Okay, so I'm going to pill the ant,
[15808.16s -> 15813.57s]  play the snail, sell the snail.
[15813.57s -> 15819.90s]  Go ahead and do that.
[15819.90s -> 15826.10s]  Pill the ant.
[15826.10s -> 15828.26s]  I didn't want you to get that, but whatever.
[15828.26s -> 15844.88s]  Snail, sell the snail, meet the swan.
[15844.88s -> 15852.38s]  I mean, maybe the badger.
[15857.27s -> 15865.47s]  I think that's the play.
[15865.47s -> 15871.71s]  I roll the whole thing in case,
[15871.71s -> 15873.91s]  because I'm going to sell something next turn anyways.
[15873.91s -> 15875.51s]  These are not good right now.
[15875.51s -> 15878.83s]  All right.
[15878.83s -> 15896.65s]  I think this is okay to me.
[15896.65s -> 15909.13s]  I really need splash damage.
[15909.13s -> 15915.49s]  I think this is okay.
[15915.49s -> 15930.30s]  That dog's not going to be a problem.
[15930.30s -> 15933.17s]  Yeah.
[15933.17s -> 15936.14s]  When are you going to play Destiny 2 PVP?
[15936.14s -> 15938.77s]  I already did.
[15938.77s -> 15943.83s]  I just deleted the VOD because I was embarrassed about it.
[15943.83s -> 15946.79s]  I just turned off notifications to subs and stuff
[15946.79s -> 15950.10s]  and followers and I just played like three or four hours
[15950.10s -> 15951.62s]  of it and I was just like, I'm not into this.
[15951.62s -> 15953.49s]  I mean, it's all right.
[15953.49s -> 15954.57s]  I just deleted the VOD and shit
[15954.57s -> 15957.29s]  because I don't want anyone to see it.
[15957.29s -> 15958.13s]  I remember that.
[15958.13s -> 15959.91s]  Yeah.
[15959.91s -> 15961.94s]  It was like fucking, yeah.
[15961.94s -> 15962.78s]  Well, I won.
[15962.78s -> 15967.69s]  So we're going to keep the snail frozen.
[15967.69s -> 15969.71s]  Oh, honey on the badger.
[15969.71s -> 15971.63s]  Honey on the badger.
[15971.63s -> 15973.40s]  What am I doing?
[15973.40s -> 15974.64s]  Oh, that stream was so bad.
[15974.64s -> 15976.70s]  It was so sad.
[15976.70s -> 15980.14s]  I know.
[15980.14s -> 15988.79s]  Honey on the badger.
[15988.79s -> 15989.63s]  All right.
[15989.63s -> 15998.74s]  I really, really want a spider or kangaroo upgrade.
[15998.74s -> 15999.98s]  No, no.
[15999.98s -> 16000.82s]  Okay.
[16000.82s -> 16001.64s]  We'll do meat.
[16001.64s -> 16011.04s]  No, we won't.
[16011.04s -> 16015.54s]  The swan.
[16015.54s -> 16019.28s]  Yeah, that's the only thing I can really do.
[16019.28s -> 16020.94s]  Okay.
[16020.98s -> 16031.86s]  Probably going to lose, but I'll get a good next turn.
[16031.86s -> 16032.70s]  It's a phone game.
[16032.70s -> 16040.62s]  It's not a phone game.
[16040.62s -> 16048.16s]  It looks pretty safe.
[16048.16s -> 16051.10s]  Literally a phone game.
[16051.10s -> 16054.15s]  This game is on Steam right now.
[16054.15s -> 16056.99s]  Is Clash of Clans on Steam?
[16056.99s -> 16060.25s]  No.
[16060.25s -> 16073.38s]  That's a phone game.
[16073.38s -> 16074.22s]  I won again.
[16074.22s -> 16077.28s]  Okay.
[16077.28s -> 16085.16s]  Well, we need to roll for some upgrades.
[16085.16s -> 16096.86s]  No.
[16096.86s -> 16103.38s]  This has to replace somebody with who?
[16103.38s -> 16106.93s]  I feel like I need both of these.
[16106.93s -> 16116.62s]  He has, and the rooster has to go in the front.
[16116.62s -> 16118.34s]  I get rid of the cricket.
[16118.34s -> 16123.03s]  I think the, or the spider.
[16123.03s -> 16125.39s]  What gets me more value here?
[16125.39s -> 16129.13s]  The spider, I think.
[16129.13s -> 16130.77s]  Cricket currently does more damage than the spider,
[16130.77s -> 16134.49s]  but the spider makes the kangaroo better.
[16134.49s -> 16140.56s]  And I'm almost about to level them up.
[16140.56s -> 16141.40s]  All right.
[16141.40s -> 16149.02s]  This is bad, but we have to do it.
[16159.56s -> 16164.94s]  Cause then this will get really, really good.
[16164.94s -> 16168.44s]  I wonder if I can, should I move the?
[16168.44s -> 16169.54s]  No, I think it stays there.
[16169.54s -> 16173.73s]  But the swan might move.
[16173.73s -> 16174.57s]  Hold on.
[16174.57s -> 16175.97s]  Let's just see what we get here.
[16175.97s -> 16176.98s]  Right?
[16176.98s -> 16181.78s]  I have a roll and I'm not going to buy any of these.
[16181.78s -> 16182.94s]  So let's say, you know what I mean?
[16182.94s -> 16183.78s]  Let's just roll.
[16183.78s -> 16191.44s]  Let's see if we get something good.
[16191.44s -> 16192.28s]  All right.
[16192.28s -> 16196.46s]  That's, this is going here.
[16196.46s -> 16198.25s]  Okay.
[16198.25s -> 16209.18s]  This is big.
[16209.82s -> 16210.66s]  Okay.
[16210.66s -> 16211.74s]  Take a look at this shit.
[16211.74s -> 16214.66s]  Perfect.
[16214.66s -> 16215.50s]  Roll again.
[16215.50s -> 16216.96s]  Okay.
[16216.96s -> 16217.78s]  All right.
[16217.78s -> 16218.62s]  Okay.
[16218.62s -> 16219.46s]  I just have to survive to another turn.
[16219.46s -> 16220.28s]  And this is big.
[16220.28s -> 16223.35s]  This is bingo.
[16223.35s -> 16224.77s]  Even if I lose, I can't sell anything.
[16224.77s -> 16227.46s]  I don't think this snow might have to go.
[16227.46s -> 16243.75s]  Find out.
[16243.75s -> 16248.30s]  At least get rid of the elephant.
[16248.30s -> 16251.72s]  That hippo is really dangerous.
[16251.72s -> 16261.77s]  Swan should kill not both of them, but it's all right.
[16261.77s -> 16266.95s]  Ooh.
[16266.95s -> 16269.37s]  Scary.
[16269.37s -> 16270.47s]  I think I had the melon armor.
[16270.47s -> 16271.79s]  That would have been very scary.
[16271.79s -> 16272.63s]  Oh!
[16272.63s -> 16274.48s]  What happened?
[16274.48s -> 16277.72s]  What?
[16277.72s -> 16280.19s]  What the hell?
[16280.23s -> 16281.07s]  Oh man.
[16281.07s -> 16281.91s]  That sucked.
[16281.91s -> 16283.78s]  Oh, come on.
[16283.78s -> 16285.78s]  Oh, but look at what it gave me.
[16285.78s -> 16287.43s]  It gave me triple.
[16287.43s -> 16288.25s]  All right.
[16288.25s -> 16291.06s]  Oh shit.
[16291.06s -> 16296.78s]  So I think the play is sell the swan,
[16296.78s -> 16301.14s]  get rid of the swan, upgrade the monkey,
[16301.14s -> 16305.18s]  put the snail up, sell the snail for the sheep.
[16305.18s -> 16313.69s]  Maybe.
[16313.69s -> 16315.07s]  Well, I know I'm doing this.
[16315.07s -> 16317.23s]  This is certain.
[16317.23s -> 16320.61s]  Like this is just certainty.
[16320.61s -> 16326.56s]  So just do it.
[16326.56s -> 16327.66s]  Four, four.
[16327.66s -> 16328.64s]  Gorilla in front.
[16328.64s -> 16329.48s]  Four, four.
[16329.48s -> 16344.40s]  Get rid of the swan.
[16344.40s -> 16345.24s]  Okay.
[16346.51s -> 16351.22s]  Gorilla's going in the front, but not yet.
[16351.22s -> 16356.52s]  Come on.
[16356.52s -> 16361.68s]  Okay.
[16361.68s -> 16369.93s]  Let's go.
[16369.93s -> 16376.88s]  This should be a winning hand.
[16376.88s -> 16385.36s]  Would have been awesome to get another gorilla.
[16385.36s -> 16386.84s]  I like the way this is set up.
[16386.84s -> 16393.75s]  Hopefully it works out.
[16393.75s -> 16396.99s]  12, 12 gorilla with the coconut shield.
[16396.99s -> 16399.95s]  It has to activate it though, which is scary.
[16399.95s -> 16400.79s]  Okay.
[16400.79s -> 16407.31s]  I will.
[16407.31s -> 16408.13s]  Took off the melon armor.
[16408.13s -> 16414.12s]  Oh, you son of a gun.
[16414.12s -> 16426.36s]  Oh, you son of a gun.
[16426.36s -> 16427.42s]  We recorded stream.
[16427.42s -> 16437.78s]  Sag.
[16437.78s -> 16440.20s]  Okay.
[16440.20s -> 16442.22s]  Oh!
[16445.41s -> 16456.49s]  But wait.
[16456.53s -> 16460.56s]  I don't know what to do at this point.
[16460.56s -> 16471.65s]  I can upgrade gorilla and then feed gorilla.
[16471.65s -> 16475.67s]  The spider sucks.
[16475.67s -> 16476.83s]  Put in two.
[16476.83s -> 16480.90s]  Okay.
[16480.90s -> 16484.58s]  Is it time to get rid of the kangaroo or the spider?
[16484.58s -> 16486.44s]  Because the kangaroo is really awful
[16486.44s -> 16494.90s]  without the spider in front of them.
[16494.90s -> 16496.22s]  Kangaroo is better with the spider.
[16496.22s -> 16497.06s]  Okay.
[16497.06s -> 16498.78s]  So what's better though,
[16498.78s -> 16504.52s]  is this is just a free 22 damage, right?
[16504.52s -> 16510.04s]  But the rooster in front of the kangaroo.
[16510.04s -> 16511.72s]  So that works still.
[16511.72s -> 16515.80s]  Sell the spider, upgrade the gorilla
[16515.80s -> 16522.88s]  and have double monkey.
[16522.88s -> 16525.12s]  Like you're talking two slots, right?
[16525.12s -> 16529.66s]  So the gorilla gets a six, six.
[16529.66s -> 16531.06s]  All right, we're going for it.
[16531.06s -> 16534.89s]  That's cool.
[16534.89s -> 16536.31s]  So this is gonna go here
[16538.60s -> 16547.27s]  and then upgrade the gorilla and then feed the gorilla.
[16547.27s -> 16548.47s]  All right, let's go.
[16548.47s -> 16553.72s]  This is gonna be a huge deal.
[16553.72s -> 16558.44s]  All right, let's do it.
[16558.44s -> 16562.90s]  21, 21.
[16562.90s -> 16565.39s]  That's a big boy.
[16565.39s -> 16567.71s]  Oh, but that's an even, that's a bigger one.
[16567.71s -> 16569.80s]  That one's bigger though.
[16569.80s -> 16573.81s]  Oh God, that's not good.
[16573.81s -> 16576.97s]  I think I still do it though.
[16576.97s -> 16582.92s]  Cause this is the strongest thing he has.
[16582.92s -> 16585.19s]  Is it okay?
[16585.19s -> 16586.61s]  No, it's not.
[16586.61s -> 16590.19s]  Aye.
[16590.19s -> 16592.14s]  It's all right.
[16592.14s -> 16593.22s]  No, it's not all right.
[16593.22s -> 16594.04s]  That's loud.
[16594.04s -> 16613.16s]  I wanted to get an upgraded gorilla so bad.
[16613.16s -> 16614.80s]  I don't want the fever.
[16614.80s -> 16622.66s]  Thank you.
[16622.66s -> 16627.15s]  How about the flooded ears?
[16627.15s -> 16628.29s]  This is it.
[16628.29s -> 16630.25s]  Yo, I'm streaming again on Sunday.
[16630.25s -> 16633.25s]  I'll be back.
[16633.25s -> 16654.27s]  This is too fun.
[16654.27s -> 16656.74s]  What about Friday?
[16656.74s -> 16658.72s]  Oh yeah, maybe it is Friday.
[16658.72s -> 16666.69s]  I'll figure it out.
[16666.69s -> 16668.47s]  I gotta talk to italics cause we're gonna play,
[16668.47s -> 16670.18s]  we're gonna play Resident Evil 6.
[16670.18s -> 16672.02s]  So it's either gonna be Friday or Sunday.
[16672.02s -> 16695.60s]  But we'll look out for Sunday.
[16695.60s -> 16701.35s]  All right, next turn, selling both ducks.
[16702.07s -> 16717.91s]  And I'm gonna try to replace the two ducks.
[16717.91s -> 16719.13s]  Is this a win?
[16719.13s -> 16731.10s]  Five, three.
[16731.10s -> 16732.42s]  I've ever played six before?
[16732.42s -> 16737.30s]  For about 30 minutes.
[16749.26s -> 16751.66s]  Okay, here's the, oh no, this sucks.
[16751.66s -> 16759.24s]  I screwed, okay, I need to do,
[16759.24s -> 16765.19s]  should I just do a weirdo porcupine build?
[16765.19s -> 16766.90s]  Yeah, let's go.
[16766.90s -> 16768.82s]  Watch this.
[16768.82s -> 16779.68s]  Okay, sell, give shop pets one, one.
[16779.68s -> 16791.64s]  Okay, all right.
[16791.64s -> 16796.60s]  Then I'm gonna roll.
[16796.60s -> 16800.30s]  Oh hell yeah.
[16800.30s -> 16812.29s]  All right, sell the beaver
[16812.29s -> 16832.19s]  and then put another hedgehog up here.
[16833.11s -> 16837.77s]  And then combine the fish.
[16837.77s -> 16839.91s]  Take a look at that.
[16839.91s -> 16842.64s]  Wowee.
[16842.64s -> 16852.15s]  I want that turtle.
[16852.15s -> 16864.67s]  Oh wait, they have to die.
[16864.67s -> 16875.09s]  So they have to die for that to trigger.
[16875.09s -> 16879.88s]  This is a win because this is guaranteed.
[16879.88s -> 16885.18s]  I'm guaranteed to win.
[16885.18s -> 16888.05s]  Cause even if they die, they will kill.
[16888.05s -> 16892.53s]  All right, interesting.
[16892.53s -> 16906.65s]  Maybe I should combine them.
[16906.65s -> 16913.21s]  Yeah, this has to be in the front cause that will die.
[16913.21s -> 16921.53s]  And then do I, I could just make one
[16921.53s -> 16931.91s]  that does four damage to everybody.
[16931.91s -> 16934.11s]  DLC pack, yeah, I switched it to the normal pack
[16934.11s -> 16937.36s]  because we were playing on the normal pack
[16937.96s -> 16939.08s]  and I accidentally switched the expansion one
[16939.08s -> 16942.54s]  and I didn't, I never switched back.
[16942.54s -> 16945.16s]  They're just gonna kill the fish.
[16945.16s -> 16947.33s]  That's true.
[16947.33s -> 16952.85s]  So why don't we do this?
[16952.85s -> 16975.33s]  And then this will just play out.
[16975.33s -> 16985.14s]  All right, what if Peacock the hedgehog?
[16985.14s -> 16986.26s]  They do too much damage.
[16986.26s -> 16993.17s]  They'll just kill it.
[16993.17s -> 16995.25s]  It does two damage, Peacock has five, right?
[16995.25s -> 17002.09s]  They'll just kill it.
[17002.09s -> 17003.17s]  All right, how bad is this gonna go?
[17003.17s -> 17006.66s]  We'll find out.
[17006.66s -> 17011.28s]  Okay, ow, shit.
[17011.28s -> 17028.40s]  Hey, it's not a loss.
[17028.40s -> 17033.76s]  Okay, this is give everybody two, two.
[17033.76s -> 17035.12s]  Do I just build for that?
[17035.12s -> 17051.97s]  Yeah, let's do it, who cares?
[17051.97s -> 17055.74s]  What's wrong?
[17055.74s -> 17060.08s]  Move the turtle?
[17060.08s -> 17076.84s]  Well, this is a disaster for this guy.
[17076.84s -> 17078.88s]  Here we go.
[17078.88s -> 17083.42s]  Oh, kill it all.
[17083.42s -> 17087.00s]  Okay, oh, hell yeah.
[17087.00s -> 17100.20s]  Everybody loses.
[17100.20s -> 17104.02s]  So I guess you have to, you garlic the hedgehogs.
[17104.02s -> 17117.84s]  That sounds like a shitty new Sonic character
[17117.84s -> 17129.99s]  because they'll only take one damage now from this.
[17129.99s -> 17136.53s]  I want a fish, bad, really bad, please.
[17136.53s -> 17139.80s]  No, oh, shit.
[17139.80s -> 17159.91s]  No, fish, move the turtle?
[17159.91s -> 17164.44s]  I like the fact that this does damage with the,
[17164.44s -> 17165.92s]  oh no, you're right, you're right,
[17165.92s -> 17167.52s]  because you can only have one buff at a time.
[17167.52s -> 17171.28s]  You're right, you're right, okay.
[17171.28s -> 17175.77s]  It'll work out though, it's fine.
[17175.77s -> 17182.24s]  Now it's over, check this out.
[17182.24s -> 17192.89s]  Yep, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
[17192.89s -> 17222.46s]  Nobody gets to win, draws only, oh no.
[17222.46s -> 17229.29s]  God damn it, okay, well, what does this do now?
[17229.29s -> 17234.92s]  Just four damage to everybody?
[17234.92s -> 17242.09s]  How am I gonna, this is gonna be fucking horrible.
[17242.09s -> 17249.50s]  I'm just gonna lose.
[17250.50s -> 17253.69s]  Why the front one?
[17253.69s -> 17254.84s]  This one needs to go all the way to the back.
[17254.84s -> 17261.64s]  Do not do that, how do I move this to the back?
[17261.64s -> 17275.32s]  How do I move this without it combining?
[17275.32s -> 17288.61s]  Very good, so I'm gonna do this, that makes sense.
[17288.61s -> 17302.94s]  I don't have any money for garlic.
[17302.94s -> 17305.22s]  This is a huge pain in the ass for anybody that fights me
[17305.22s -> 17310.24s]  even though it's not that great.
[17310.24s -> 17319.60s]  This is a huge pain in the ass.
[17319.60s -> 17327.85s]  Okay, that's fine, all right, again.
[17327.85s -> 17330.96s]  Oh shit, come on, turtle, turtle, I need the turtle.
[17330.96s -> 17353.52s]  Nice, very good, okay, oh, come on.
[17353.52s -> 17361.32s]  Wait, before I do anything stupid,
[17361.32s -> 17381.23s]  level two turtle will give two armors.
[17381.23s -> 17384.13s]  That doesn't really help me in this stupid build.
[17384.13s -> 17386.19s]  All right, here's what I'm gonna do.
[17386.19s -> 17389.80s]  I think I'm gonna combine hedgehogs
[17389.80s -> 17401.26s]  and have two level two hedgehogs
[17401.26s -> 17405.30s]  because that's probably better.
[17405.30s -> 17412.36s]  Don't do it yet, do it in one more turn.
[17415.58s -> 17419.13s]  They'll kill you, you need honey.
[17419.13s -> 17420.73s]  I actually do need honey, you're right,
[17420.73s -> 17425.94s]  because they're gonna kill everybody.
[17425.94s -> 17427.04s]  I need to roll for honey.
[17427.04s -> 17432.68s]  The monkey's cool, but not for this build.
[17432.68s -> 17437.71s]  Oh, wait a second, wait a second.
[17437.71s -> 17449.83s]  Excuse me, that's a big deal.
[17449.99s -> 17463.60s]  Oh shit, okay, are we ready?
[17463.60s -> 17466.31s]  I think we're ready.
[17466.31s -> 17469.49s]  Oh, should the turtle go in the front to hit?
[17469.49s -> 17475.30s]  Who should the turtle give it to?
[17475.30s -> 17480.40s]  Ellen will cancel the garlic, so I need to give it to you.
[17480.40s -> 17487.62s]  I want the fish to be in the back.
[17487.62s -> 17501.15s]  The fish is gonna die, I think that's all right.
[17501.15s -> 17510.47s]  All right, let's go.
[17510.47s -> 17514.20s]  Can you do the Elmo voice?
[17514.20s -> 17517.60s]  Hello, hi Mr. Noodle.
[17517.60s -> 17527.48s]  I woke up too early, I can't do it.
[17527.48s -> 17532.68s]  Kill this guy in the front.
[17532.68s -> 17542.53s]  I hit Melanon, oh, it's 20 damage, no.
[17542.53s -> 17551.46s]  It only blocks 20, that's right.
[17551.50s -> 17553.02s]  All right, this shithead build
[17553.02s -> 17561.12s]  is not working out very well.
[17561.12s -> 17575.78s]  I could just do two level two hedgehogs.
[17575.78s -> 17581.02s]  What is that?
[17581.02s -> 17590.47s]  Oh, Douglas, it's me, Mr. Dink.
[17590.49s -> 17601.83s]  That's definitely going on, one of these guys.
[17613.92s -> 17618.95s]  End the stream now, no.
[17618.95s -> 17620.79s]  This is just so stupid, it's gonna do eight damage
[17620.79s -> 17621.79s]  and kill everybody, who cares?
[17621.79s -> 17633.91s]  It's funny, this is the last one anyways.
[17633.91s -> 17638.20s]  It should be like this.
[17638.20s -> 17644.98s]  I do have a reroll, that's right.
[17644.98s -> 17646.70s]  Not enough to do anything interesting.
[17646.70s -> 17651.72s]  I'm gonna garlic, who do I do?
[17651.76s -> 17655.18s]  Maybe just health on the turtle or something.
[17655.18s -> 17658.16s]  Health on the tiger so he stays alive long enough
[17658.16s -> 17664.12s]  to at least have this happen once.
[17664.12s -> 17672.08s]  Or garlic on the tiger, otherwise he'll just die.
[17672.08s -> 17675.77s]  But then he'll take two from that, all right.
[17675.77s -> 17678.07s]  Well, this is gonna be stupid.
[17678.07s -> 17682.15s]  I get to do this one more time.
[17682.15s -> 17698.82s]  Wap the hedgehogs, all right, let's go.
[17698.82s -> 17705.76s]  No, the German tiger will die.
[17705.76s -> 17707.36s]  Can you combine it for a level three?
[17707.36s -> 17709.97s]  Do two level twos turn into a level three?
[17709.97s -> 17714.86s]  I don't know, I'm unaware of how that works.
[17714.86s -> 17718.92s]  I mean, if it goes off, it kills everybody.
[17718.92s -> 17729.48s]  Literally everybody dies.
[17729.48s -> 17732.34s]  Oh man, it's gonna happen.
[17732.34s -> 17736.33s]  Yeah, that's it.
[17736.33s -> 17743.09s]  No, stupid boss, oh shit.
[17743.09s -> 17746.17s]  All right, okay, please confirm with me.
[17746.17s -> 17748.65s]  If I combine these two, does it make a level three?
[17748.65s -> 17750.69s]  Because doing six damage,
[17750.69s -> 17759.18s]  doing 12 damage to everyone is kind of funny.
[17759.18s -> 17768.70s]  I didn't get a, oh, this is gonna do six damage to everybody.
[17768.70s -> 17784.76s]  I have to keep the tiger alive.
[17784.76s -> 17788.33s]  12 with tiger, yeah, this is gonna be insane.
[17788.33s -> 17789.17s]  Do another one?
[17789.17s -> 17793.12s]  No, I don't think I want to.
[17793.12s -> 17794.48s]  All right, I gotta roll for like a melon
[17794.48s -> 17796.49s]  or something for the tiger, yeah.
[17796.85s -> 17807.33s]  I need something else just to stand in the way.
[17807.33s -> 17810.19s]  This has to hit two people.
[17810.19s -> 17816.60s]  Put the turtle in front of the hog
[17816.60s -> 17820.39s]  so it'll protect the both of them, I guess, I don't know.
[17820.39s -> 17828.65s]  Puffer fish could be interesting, really late for it.
[17828.65s -> 17832.15s]  It's just too late for it.
[17832.15s -> 17841.65s]  Hog two is dumb, all right.
[17841.65s -> 17851.11s]  I mean, it's just, I could buff up the tiger.
[17851.11s -> 17855.84s]  Do the rooster, they just die.
[17855.84s -> 17860.78s]  And rooster in the back.
[17860.78s -> 17863.18s]  I don't think the rooster's gonna survive.
[17863.18s -> 17866.25s]  It's 12 damage, guys.
[17866.25s -> 17872.83s]  If this thing goes, everyone goes.
[17873.55s -> 17874.39s]  Oh, we're hoping for worries.
[17874.39s -> 17876.55s]  It kills everything and then the chick pops up.
[17876.55s -> 17879.41s]  Okay, right, that makes sense.
[17879.41s -> 17883.61s]  Well, how is this for placement?
[17883.61s -> 17884.65s]  I think that's as good as it's gonna get.
[17884.65s -> 17890.68s]  This is stupid.
[17890.68s -> 17893.04s]  Is this stupid enough to just ruin everybody's game
[17893.04s -> 17898.18s]  and have me win games?
[17898.18s -> 17905.02s]  Make sure the rooster's in front of the turtle.
[17905.02s -> 17909.09s]  I know, I want him to die after this.
[17909.09s -> 17910.17s]  We'll see.
[17910.17s -> 17914.97s]  No, I think this is fine like this.
[17914.97s -> 17917.39s]  Rooster needs to be last, yeah.
[17917.39s -> 17920.52s]  This is fine.
[17920.52s -> 17926.73s]  Here we go, good luck.
[17926.73s -> 17932.79s]  Let's see how this works.
[17932.83s -> 17939.51s]  Okay, well, this is gonna be an interesting scenario.
[17939.51s -> 17945.66s]  Okay, fine, 12 damage.
[17945.66s -> 17948.09s]  Oh no, come on.
[17948.09s -> 17953.36s]  Oh shit, oh shit.
[17953.36s -> 17957.15s]  Did I win?
[17957.15s -> 17958.55s]  Oh, you have a dumb ass porcupine.
[17958.55s -> 17974.88s]  Okay, we're good.
[17974.88s -> 17975.72s]  What's the deal here?
[17975.72s -> 17986.64s]  Do I just keep giving food to the rooster?
[17986.64s -> 17996.67s]  Just keep buffing the chicken like crazy?
[17996.67s -> 17998.97s]  Rooster needs honey.
[17998.97s -> 18010.06s]  Yeah, yeah, we need to roll for either another rooster.
[18010.06s -> 18013.17s]  Cat is better than the fish.
[18013.17s -> 18016.89s]  It is, okay.
[18016.93s -> 18020.84s]  The fish just has garlic on it.
[18020.84s -> 18022.96s]  So we can put cat instead of fish
[18022.96s -> 18025.20s]  and then feed the cat a bunch.
[18025.20s -> 18027.49s]  Does the cat get the benefit from this?
[18027.49s -> 18029.65s]  We have all current and future shop heads too too.
[18029.65s -> 18036.63s]  Does that mean he's a 4-4?
[18036.63s -> 18038.99s]  And before cat, you can feed anything.
[18038.99s -> 18044.32s]  Okay, so that should be 4-4 added.
[18044.32s -> 18045.68s]  Well, that was wrong apparently
[18045.68s -> 18051.81s]  because that's only a 10-11.
[18051.81s -> 18053.21s]  It has to be purchased first.
[18053.21s -> 18059.02s]  Well, we know we're doing this.
[18059.02s -> 18061.64s]  That's so cute.
[18061.64s -> 18068.58s]  Steak, all right, it's like this is six-six.
[18068.58s -> 18075.56s]  Do this and make the cat a 16-17?
[18075.56s -> 18082.58s]  Or do I cupcake the rooster instead
[18082.58s -> 18087.97s]  to make sure that there'll be at least 11 or 12 damage?
[18087.97s -> 18091.60s]  Do the cow instead of who?
[18091.60s -> 18095.16s]  Who do I get rid of?
[18095.16s -> 18096.52s]  I mean, freeze the cow is a good idea,
[18096.52s -> 18100.96s]  but remember, this is over if I die.
[18100.96s -> 18105.45s]  Get rid of the turtle at this point
[18105.45s -> 18107.61s]  and just buy the food from the cow
[18107.61s -> 18109.68s]  and just give it to the cat twice.
[18109.68s -> 18121.60s]  So it'll be like a 20-20.
[18121.60s -> 18124.69s]  Ludwig is stealing your strats.
[18124.69s -> 18129.63s]  I think we feed, yeah, I think we get rid of the turtle.
[18129.63s -> 18133.08s]  We either give it to the cat
[18133.08s -> 18139.81s]  or just stuff the rooster full of milk.
[18139.81s -> 18141.26s]  Well, let's do it.
[18141.26s -> 18143.17s]  Let's go for it.
[18143.17s -> 18150.28s]  Okay, cow coming in.
[18150.28s -> 18152.00s]  Cupcake, wait, cupcake.
[18152.00s -> 18153.96s]  Cupcake to rooster?
[18153.96s -> 18155.10s]  No, what do I do?
[18155.10s -> 18158.06s]  Cupcake to cat and then all milk to cat.
[18158.06s -> 18163.18s]  This would be like a 30-30
[18163.18s -> 18166.82s]  because it clears the items.
[18166.82s -> 18170.15s]  Cupcake to cat, that means 16-17.
[18170.15s -> 18172.47s]  Two milks is eight-eight.
[18172.47s -> 18175.51s]  17 plus eight is like 25 or something.
[18175.51s -> 18178.50s]  And it's not gonna be like, that's gonna be like 25-25.
[18178.50s -> 18180.66s]  It's free, the milk is free.
[18180.66s -> 18181.50s]  I don't have enough money.
[18181.50s -> 18185.36s]  Oh, okay.
[18185.36s -> 18187.95s]  All right, so what I'm doing is I'm putting the cow up.
[18187.95s -> 18192.25s]  Cow's gonna get the milk.
[18192.25s -> 18194.25s]  Milk is going to the cat or to the rooster?
[18194.25s -> 18196.74s]  Probably the rooster, right?
[18196.74s -> 18197.90s]  And then the cow is just gonna die.
[18197.90s -> 18202.14s]  Everyone's gonna die, who cares?
[18202.14s -> 18202.98s]  Cat or rooster?
[18202.98s -> 18204.70s]  I think the safe play is rooster
[18204.70s -> 18206.26s]  because then he'll come back with another,
[18206.26s -> 18208.44s]  be able to kill it.
[18208.44s -> 18210.04s]  I mean, we'll have a really beefy cat,
[18210.04s -> 18215.31s]  but I don't know if that's good enough.
[18215.31s -> 18216.55s]  Boost the rooster.
[18216.55s -> 18220.57s]  That'd be four-four or eight-eight to the cat.
[18220.57s -> 18227.66s]  I don't know, I kind of want to see it to the cat.
[18227.66s -> 18229.85s]  But hold on, here's the thing.
[18229.89s -> 18231.71s]  If I give it to the rooster,
[18231.71s -> 18235.61s]  the rooster will survive the apocalypse
[18235.61s -> 18240.14s]  because this is 12 damage.
[18240.14s -> 18245.27s]  I think it has to be the rooster.
[18245.27s -> 18249.23s]  Yeah, it has to be.
[18249.23s -> 18257.84s]  The rooster now survives the apocalypse.
[18257.84s -> 18262.60s]  In fact, I'm doing it again.
[18262.60s -> 18264.70s]  Here we go.
[18264.70s -> 18267.44s]  Last chance, let's just roll.
[18267.44s -> 18269.40s]  Oh, and you're gonna show me your chocolate right now?
[18269.40s -> 18278.52s]  Is that what you're gonna do, really?
[18278.52s -> 18283.66s]  Well, fuck it, here we go.
[18283.66s -> 18290.50s]  Curious.
[18290.50s -> 18292.02s]  Look at all these, oh, you got a level,
[18292.02s -> 18297.31s]  17, 19 damage, 19 health, that's fine.
[18297.31s -> 18301.11s]  No one's surviving the apocalypse.
[18301.11s -> 18304.64s]  Oh, fuck, this is not good.
[18304.64s -> 18307.06s]  It is good, I win.
[18307.06s -> 18310.54s]  Do I win or is it a draw?
[18310.54s -> 18315.92s]  Oh, it's a draw.
[18315.92s -> 18319.32s]  Oh, well, this looks so bad, but this is fun.
[18319.32s -> 18326.60s]  Okay, damn it.
[18326.60s -> 18330.02s]  This is, I win every game now.
[18330.02s -> 18331.26s]  I win every game.
[18331.26s -> 18334.69s]  There's no way I lose another game after this.
[18334.69s -> 18336.73s]  Mushroom on the rooster is,
[18336.73s -> 18339.29s]  I've guaranteed to win every single game
[18339.29s -> 18347.86s]  no matter what happens.
[18347.86s -> 18350.90s]  Wait a minute, should it be on the hedgehog?
[18350.90s -> 18351.86s]  Because then the hedgehog would come back
[18351.86s -> 18358.36s]  and do 12, six damage again?
[18358.36s -> 18359.72s]  Does it come back as a level one?
[18359.72s -> 18362.08s]  No, it just comes back as a one, one.
[18362.08s -> 18369.11s]  Okay, so that would be bad.
[18369.11s -> 18371.25s]  Chocolate the cat.
[18371.25s -> 18373.47s]  One up the hedgehog.
[18373.47s -> 18374.59s]  It would still be level three,
[18374.59s -> 18377.86s]  so nobody will ever win.
[18377.86s -> 18379.64s]  This would be horrible.
[18379.64s -> 18383.91s]  Just do it for the nuke build.
[18383.91s -> 18390.87s]  That's 18 damage.
[18392.15s -> 18399.54s]  Somebody said feed the chocolate to the cat, okay?
[18399.54s -> 18400.54s]  Do it to the rooster.
[18400.54s -> 18405.77s]  Do it with, yeah, I need to make sure there's no survivors.
[18405.77s -> 18407.45s]  Chocolate the rooster.
[18407.45s -> 18410.05s]  Wait, so this is not just for the cat,
[18410.05s -> 18411.65s]  this is for everybody up here.
[18411.65s -> 18413.65s]  So if I give it to the rooster,
[18413.65s -> 18415.52s]  it'll be level two, rooster.
[18415.52s -> 18417.88s]  And the rooster will make two.
[18417.88s -> 18420.79s]  Oh my God.
[18420.79s -> 18423.28s]  Oh my God, that's good.
[18423.28s -> 18425.99s]  That's, no one will ever win.
[18425.99s -> 18428.40s]  I win every game.
[18428.40s -> 18429.22s]  Don't do it?
[18429.22s -> 18430.06s]  No, no, no, don't do it.
[18430.06s -> 18431.60s]  Only works for one?
[18431.60s -> 18434.66s]  It doesn't affect chocolate?
[18434.66s -> 18436.26s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[18436.26s -> 18437.08s]  Roll first.
[18437.08s -> 18437.92s]  Wait, what do you mean?
[18437.92s -> 18438.74s]  It doesn't work?
[18438.74s -> 18441.52s]  It's health and attack only.
[18441.52s -> 18444.48s]  Oh.
[18444.48s -> 18447.00s]  All right, well, I'm giving the mushroom to the hedgehog
[18447.00s -> 18449.75s]  because who cares?
[18449.75s -> 18451.58s]  It's over.
[18451.58s -> 18456.26s]  Who gives a shit?
[18456.26s -> 18465.28s]  So now I'm looking for another cow.
[18465.28s -> 18466.40s]  Does fly help me?
[18466.40s -> 18467.60s]  I don't think so.
[18467.60s -> 18470.77s]  Not at this stage.
[18470.77s -> 18478.97s]  Unless I put him behind the rooster.
[18478.97s -> 18479.93s]  Sushi's not bad here.
[18479.93s -> 18487.84s]  No, just use the sushi.
[18487.84s -> 18488.76s]  Fly is just gonna die.
[18488.76s -> 18494.12s]  That's true.
[18494.12s -> 18501.49s]  I would love another cow.
[18501.49s -> 18506.56s]  Sell cow and get the bison.
[18506.56s -> 18509.48s]  Yeah, that's not a bad idea either.
[18509.48s -> 18516.56s]  Do two every time.
[18516.56s -> 18517.52s]  All right, I'm gonna roll once.
[18517.52s -> 18518.44s]  I'm gonna freeze this guy
[18518.44s -> 18519.28s]  because I think that's a good idea.
[18519.28s -> 18524.64s]  So we get one roll and we can sell.
[18524.64s -> 18539.78s]  Let's see what happens.
[18539.78s -> 18542.12s]  Okay, so this is level three.
[18542.12s -> 18548.15s]  I really need, there's no defense back here.
[18548.15s -> 18549.07s]  All right, let's do it.
[18549.07s -> 18561.50s]  This time, this is gonna be stupid.
[18561.54s -> 18565.44s]  Defense is unnecessary because of the nuke, yeah.
[18565.44s -> 18566.64s]  Well, I can tell you right now,
[18566.64s -> 18568.40s]  this could be really bad.
[18576.91s -> 18582.33s]  Okay, here we go.
[18582.33s -> 18587.13s]  Okay, do it again.
[18587.13s -> 18589.43s]  That's a win.
[18589.43s -> 18595.24s]  When am I gonna lose another game again?
[18595.24s -> 18596.68s]  You just have to lose every time
[18596.68s -> 18602.85s]  until you get level three hedgehog and a mushroom.
[18602.85s -> 18610.95s]  The goal now is to try to get these upgraded.
[18610.95s -> 18618.77s]  Okay, so I could do cupcake on the cat,
[18618.77s -> 18621.82s]  broccoli on the tiger, that doesn't do anything.
[18621.82s -> 18623.42s]  Upgrade the rooster, fuck the tiger.
[18623.94s -> 18628.56s]  Upgrades don't do anything on the tiger.
[18628.56s -> 18634.44s]  We're looking for a rooster.
[18634.44s -> 18636.20s]  So I'm gonna use chocolate on the rooster
[18636.20s -> 18640.81s]  and then we need to find a rooster.
[18640.81s -> 18643.05s]  It's so important to find a rooster right now.
[18643.05s -> 18648.11s]  I'm just gonna roll till I find one.
[18648.11s -> 18650.37s]  It's not a rooster.
[18650.37s -> 18653.73s]  It is a bison though.
[18653.73s -> 18656.34s]  Shit, can I do this twice?
[18656.34s -> 18660.01s]  Wait, hold on.
[18660.01s -> 18669.66s]  What if I mushroomed the tiger?
[18669.66s -> 18677.36s]  So then it would be 12 damage again.
[18677.36s -> 18687.35s]  This is literally impossible to beat.
[18687.35s -> 18690.43s]  I don't think there's a meta in this game
[18690.43s -> 18693.31s]  that could beat level three hedgehog,
[18693.31s -> 18697.15s]  mushroomed, mushroomed tiger.
[18697.15s -> 18701.78s]  I will always at least have one character left
[18701.78s -> 18705.11s]  unless they have something in the back.
[18705.11s -> 18712.01s]  It won't work, why not?
[18712.01s -> 18713.76s]  It will be dead.
[18713.76s -> 18715.48s]  Well, this blows up, this does 12 damage.
[18715.48s -> 18722.72s]  It comes back and then it does it again
[18722.72s -> 18725.25s]  because it has to die, because this has to die.
[18725.25s -> 18727.49s]  So when it comes back, it'll die
[18727.49s -> 18729.45s]  and then this will come back and then do it.
[18729.45s -> 18731.01s]  It, yeah, this should work.
[18731.01s -> 18735.40s]  Let's just do it, who cares?
[18735.40s -> 18747.08s]  And then we're gonna give splash damage to the bison.
[18747.08s -> 18754.89s]  Okay, good luck.
[18754.89s -> 18756.01s]  I have no idea what's gonna happen,
[18756.01s -> 18760.36s]  but it might be funny.
[18760.88s -> 18762.92s]  You're gonna get wiped out, buddy.
[18762.92s -> 18764.16s]  You're gonna get wiped out.
[18764.16s -> 18769.00s]  You have no idea, you're gonna get wiped out.
[18769.00s -> 18770.60s]  Oh, oh no, what happened?
[18770.60s -> 18777.20s]  What am I gonna do now?
[18777.20s -> 18780.22s]  It's gonna work, it's gonna work.
[18780.22s -> 18786.48s]  Oh God, wait, it didn't work?
[18786.48s -> 18793.12s]  Wait, why did that not work?
[18793.12s -> 18795.80s]  Why not?
[18795.80s -> 18798.03s]  Come on, are you kidding me?
[18798.03s -> 18804.40s]  Oh, rooster.
[18804.40s -> 18807.31s]  I win, oh my God.
[18807.31s -> 18817.68s]  No, that's what I didn't, don't relax, it's fine.
[18817.68s -> 18821.49s]  So I think it's just pizza.
[18821.49s -> 18824.50s]  Tiger doesn't really do anything.
[18824.50s -> 18830.89s]  B and pizza, B on the rooster?
[18830.89s -> 18835.79s]  Rooster, honey?
[18835.79s -> 18837.43s]  Rooster, honey, yeah, because then it would be,
[18837.43s -> 18840.23s]  yeah, it's over.
[18840.23s -> 18843.35s]  Honey on the rooster for sure.
[18843.35s -> 18846.36s]  Then we get a pizza.
[18846.36s -> 18848.12s]  Oh man, oh man, it's over.
[18848.12s -> 18851.08s]  I am, I'm gonna come back from the dead here.
[18851.08s -> 18852.64s]  I was at one heart.
[18852.64s -> 18861.68s]  I'm gonna win all eight of these games in a row.
[18861.68s -> 18862.80s]  I don't think there's anything else I do.
[18862.80s -> 18863.80s]  I think there's real for food,
[18863.80s -> 18873.60s]  which that's a pretty good, that's pretty good.
[18873.60s -> 18880.62s]  I'll keep this one.
[18880.62s -> 18881.78s]  This is just crazy enough, I think,
[18881.78s -> 18883.51s]  to carry us the whole way.
[18883.51s -> 18886.45s]  As long as I can keep that rooster alive.
[18886.49s -> 18888.13s]  Oh boy, that's very bad.
[18888.13s -> 18890.39s]  I don't think this is gonna play out.
[18890.39s -> 18892.80s]  Now I'm actually kind of scared.
[18892.80s -> 18894.08s]  It's not enough.
[18894.08s -> 18896.54s]  Is it not enough?
[18896.54s -> 18903.33s]  Shit, it's not enough.
[18903.33s -> 18905.05s]  Oh, it's just not enough.
[18905.05s -> 18907.13s]  He's gonna kill everybody.
[18907.13s -> 18909.65s]  No.
[18909.65s -> 18912.87s]  Oh, what the hell?
[18912.87s -> 18914.39s]  That was fun.
[18914.39s -> 18920.80s]  Now it's over.
[18920.80s -> 18922.64s]  How do you get a 50-50 goose?
[18922.64s -> 18923.48s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[18923.48s -> 18926.99s]  How do you get a 50-50 goose?
[18926.99s -> 18933.94s]  How does that happen?
[18933.94s -> 18935.26s]  All right, no, that's it, that's it.
[18935.26s -> 18936.54s]  This is only supposed to be like a stream
[18936.54s -> 18938.86s]  that was like an hour long.
[18938.86s -> 18941.27s]  I'll see you guys this weekend.
[18941.27s -> 18942.19s]  It was fun playing into it.
[18942.71s -> 18943.91s]  If anything, this tournament,
[18943.91s -> 18945.35s]  even though I lost like every game
[18945.35s -> 18948.69s]  and I didn't know what the hell I was doing,
[18948.69s -> 18949.51s]  this is really fun.
[18949.51s -> 18952.70s]  I like this a lot.
[18952.70s -> 18956.98s]  Thanks Ludwig for the invite.
[18956.98s -> 18961.10s]  I'll do better next time.
[18961.10s -> 18961.94s]  I'll see you guys this weekend,
[18961.94s -> 18964.71s]  either Friday or Sunday.
[18964.71s -> 18968.18s]  Let's see what Alex is up to.
[18968.18s -> 18971.48s]  See what day probably works better.
[18971.48s -> 18975.09s]  So I'll see you soon.
[18975.09s -> 18977.34s]  That was super AutoPets.
[18977.34s -> 18980.30s]  And that was a lot of fun.
[18980.30s -> 18983.36s]  Take care of yourselves.
[18983.36s -> 18985.15s]  We can run the credits though.
[18985.15s -> 18985.99s]  How long?
[18985.99s -> 18991.37s]  This stream is way longer than I thought it was.
[18991.37s -> 18995.09s]  Is Ludwig still streaming?
[18995.09s -> 19002.24s]  Like what the fuck just happened?
[19002.24s -> 19004.28s]  Let me see.
[19004.28s -> 19007.08s]  Yeah, we'll go raid Ludwig.
[19007.08s -> 19008.81s]  Playing AutoPets, right?
[19008.81s -> 19010.10s]  Go say hello.
[19010.10s -> 19014.20s]  Say thanks for the invite.
[19014.20s -> 19018.08s]  And I will see you guys later.
[19018.08s -> 19019.48s]  Thanks for coming.
[19019.48s -> 19021.18s]  Thanks to all the subs.
[19021.18s -> 19023.36s]  See you guys this weekend.
[19023.36s -> 19028.87s]  We can start the raid.
[19028.87s -> 19031.04s]  Raid.
[19031.04s -> 19032.12s]  I don't even know how many people are here.
[19032.12s -> 19036.77s]  I haven't even looked the whole time.
[19036.77s -> 19037.61s]  Was that fun to watch?
[19037.61s -> 19044.98s]  Cause it was like fun to play.
[19044.98s -> 19046.02s]  All right, I'll see you guys later.
[19046.02s -> 19055.91s]  Take care.
[19055.91s -> 19057.81s]  By the way, the game is free.
[19057.81s -> 19061.51s]  It's $5 to get the like DLC pets,
[19061.51s -> 19063.73s]  which I mean like really,
[19063.73s -> 19068.53s]  it's like $4.99 or something.
[19068.53s -> 19069.35s]  Take care of yourselves.
[19069.35s -> 19070.82s]  See you guys soon.
[19070.82s -> 19077.11s]  Have a great rest of your night and goodbye.
