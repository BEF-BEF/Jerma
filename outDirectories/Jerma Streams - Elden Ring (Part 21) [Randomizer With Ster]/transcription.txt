[21.24s -> 28.14s]  Hello everybody. We're a little late, but it's all right.
[28.14s -> 33.26s]  We were trying to get um, Ster, you could go ahead and give a small explanation
[33.26s -> 40.25s]  if you want. Um, it's really hard to make Elden Ring mods work with other Elden
[40.25s -> 43.77s]  Ring mods without doing a lot of shenanigans to
[43.77s -> 46.73s]  merge things properly and have them load in the right
[46.73s -> 50.49s]  order. And I had everything perfectly working,
[50.49s -> 54.54s]  but our greed to have it all working really kept us going.
[54.54s -> 59.37s]  What's the downfall? Me. Well, no, that's it.
[59.37s -> 65.45s]  So we, everything seems to be working as intended. We have the Diablo 2 loot mod.
[65.45s -> 70.09s]  We have Diablo, we have, I almost said Diablo 2 reforged.
[70.09s -> 75.29s]  We have Elden Ring reforged and a new randomizer seed with new
[75.29s -> 80.82s]  randomizations. The problem is Elden Ring reforged
[80.82s -> 84.90s]  probably doesn't work. One part of it doesn't work.
[84.90s -> 88.50s]  Okay. It's a really big mod to be clear. There's a lot of stuff in it
[88.50s -> 92.10s]  and we don't know what doesn't work in it, but the options when you sit down in
[92.10s -> 96.02s]  a bonfire, a tree kills us when we select them.
[96.02s -> 99.86s]  Yes, so we cannot explain that. We are instantly killed
[99.86s -> 103.22s]  when we, and we don't know what it says. There's no text string. It just
[103.22s -> 107.40s]  says like text goes here and we don't know what we're selecting.
[107.40s -> 112.86s]  So maybe. And then you say yes and a tree kills you. A tree kills you when you say yes.
[112.86s -> 118.70s]  And then randomizer works, but the item randomizer does not work.
[118.70s -> 122.70s]  So only enemies are randomized, but Diablo items
[122.70s -> 129.86s]  are randomized. So here we go. So we're good.
[129.86s -> 132.42s]  All right, are you through the tutorial? We're gonna do, let's just get through
[132.42s -> 135.48s]  the tutorial first. Just so we can get in there. Wait, did you make a
[135.48s -> 139.16s]  character? No, I was looking at the, what, my starting characters. Oh, okay.
[139.16s -> 144.02s]  All right, so I made somebody. So I'll just, I'll just do that part first.
[144.02s -> 147.54s]  Did you, did you choose based on like? I choose, I choose
[147.54s -> 150.82s]  based on the starting stats because I've been,
[150.82s -> 155.40s]  and plus I got, I'm all right. Oh, I was gonna look through and see like the
[155.40s -> 158.68s]  starting items because we have for some reason very weird starting
[158.68s -> 166.01s]  items and this one character for me looks like very OP. Interesting.
[166.01s -> 170.55s]  Oh, grab it. I might, I might. This is the character that I have.
[170.55s -> 175.78s]  Because I see what I want to do if I can. I want to do
[175.86s -> 179.14s]  like frenzied flame shit. My character's name is
[179.14s -> 183.98s]  My Eyes with an exclamation point. Because your eyes hurt.
[183.98s -> 186.94s]  Well, because it's like, the fire comes out of their eyes.
[186.94s -> 197.64s]  Oh, the three fingers, dude. Yeah. All right, so hopefully we,
[197.64s -> 209.54s]  everything went fine. I don't know. Yeah, I think I gotta pick my warrior.
[209.54s -> 213.66s]  I'm not gonna be able to use my starting weapons for like hours.
[213.66s -> 216.62s]  What is, what is your, what's your starting weapon?
[216.62s -> 222.66s]  The meteorite beast's greatsword is dual wielding them.
[222.66s -> 225.94s]  So how are you gonna be able to play with, you're gonna have to wait like
[225.94s -> 233.05s]  two days to play it. Yeah, I think it's worth the wait.
[233.05s -> 239.66s]  Excuse me, dual welding. Get it right. Say it correctly.
[239.66s -> 246.14s]  All right, I'm going up. I, so I'm gonna show everybody what we're talking about.
[246.14s -> 251.90s]  Does anybody know, I wanted to play the warlock character.
[251.90s -> 256.30s]  Yeah, so Elden Ring Reforged has classes that you get to choose immediately when
[256.30s -> 260.34s]  you sit down in a bonfire. You can buy an item to activate a class,
[260.34s -> 263.96s]  but the tree kills us if we try and do it, so I don't think we can do any of
[263.96s -> 269.86s]  that. There's three other classes that are like dropped somewhere, so we'll be
[269.86s -> 272.02s]  able to find those, and I don't know what they do because it
[272.02s -> 274.66s]  doesn't tell you, and I don't think you can get the classes
[274.66s -> 279.32s]  anywhere else. Yeah, because I don't, I don't know what any of this stuff does.
[279.32s -> 283.26s]  I don't think it matters what you want to do. So what, so if I want to do that,
[283.26s -> 288.25s]  the like warlock class from Elden Ring Reforged. I think you're
[288.33s -> 291.29s]  out of luck because it will kill you. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Somebody said,
[291.29s -> 295.18s]  no, the tree, hold on. The tree, it kills you because you changed the difficulty
[295.18s -> 298.63s]  setting in Reforged settings, but the text is broken due to compatibility.
[298.63s -> 302.92s]  Make sure your config files are everything in the right order.
[302.92s -> 311.02s]  That makes sense. So this is not where you pick a class,
[311.02s -> 315.98s]  or? It is. From one of those option menus, it eventually gets you to a
[315.98s -> 320.87s]  class choice. Okay, well, did anybody know which one?
[320.87s -> 325.75s]  If I want to do warlock, does anybody know where that is in here?
[325.75s -> 341.91s]  Because I don't know. First, third, fifth, wait, what happened?
[342.79s -> 347.37s]  That's just hilarious that someone, I don't believe, how can they actually know?
[347.37s -> 356.87s]  Three, two, four. Okay, one, three. There's no two here. I want to do warlock.
[356.87s -> 361.51s]  Go outside the first door to the right of Vary under the cliff.
[361.51s -> 368.12s]  There is something I need as a fortune item to change classes.
[368.12s -> 375.11s]  Is that for real? All right, let me get out of here first, but the Diablo loot
[375.11s -> 379.54s]  should be working, which it is because I picked up this.
[379.54s -> 384.60s]  I have an uncommon club on. I have an ancestral holy giant seal of the
[384.60s -> 392.26s]  God Slayer. Is that like, is that like a really good fucking item?
[392.26s -> 406.47s]  It's ancestral. I feel like that's like, did I get like a god item rolled at the
[406.47s -> 410.01s]  very beginning? I don't know. I don't know what's going
[410.01s -> 414.15s]  on, man. Well, we're going to figure it out.
[414.15s -> 418.86s]  Oh, also there's one secret mod in the pack. There is?
[418.86s -> 427.53s]  Yeah. What do you mean? And it only affects Ronnie.
[427.53s -> 431.22s]  You, you, you, you didn't, you didn't put it up. You didn't know.
[431.22s -> 438.04s]  There's no way you did that, although I did just,
[438.04s -> 441.00s]  hey, dude, take a bunch of these files and put them in your folder.
[441.00s -> 445.35s]  And I was like, yeah, sure. That makes sense. So you could have probably put
[445.35s -> 451.91s]  anything you wanted in here. Oh, I'm glad that you trust me, um,
[451.91s -> 456.28s]  but not enough to be like a mod on your channel. Ah, that's too much for you.
[456.28s -> 460.98s]  That's too much power for you. I agree completely. All right, I am,
[460.98s -> 464.82s]  I'm like ready to get in your game. You're at, you're at the church,
[464.90s -> 471.42s]  I assume. Well, no, I mean, I will be. I'm running to the church and then I'm
[471.42s -> 476.68s]  going to open my world. What do you think of the halftime show?
[476.68s -> 484.09s]  Um, it was kind of like, it was good. I don't even, I, I have no, I didn't,
[484.09s -> 486.17s]  guys, I didn't even, I forgot the Super Bowls today.
[486.17s -> 492.95s]  Same. I forgot the Super Bowl was literally today.
[492.95s -> 502.38s]  I thought they stopped doing sports. Okay, I am at the church.
[502.38s -> 505.82s]  Now, there's been a lot going on. There's been a lot going on, right?
[505.82s -> 509.10s]  Like I, I, my brain, I just, I would have normally probably watched it.
[510.34s -> 514.34s]  Okay. Strengthen, strengthen arm in or event to talk, whatever.
[516.02s -> 525.29s]  Common sleeps, Erd tree seal. Okay. What does that mean? Causes sleep buildup?
[527.08s -> 532.84s]  What? I'm very confused by how this works. Okay.
[533.56s -> 537.24s]  Oh yeah. Like, uh, all of the, uh, status effects I believe got changed.
[537.24s -> 541.16s]  So like sleep functions a little bit differently, like poisons a little bit different.
[542.04s -> 545.24s]  Like reforge did a lot of stuff. I don't know what any of it is.
[545.24s -> 549.08s]  Okay. All right. So I can burn my, all right. I'm ready to join your game.
[549.08s -> 550.76s]  Are we ready? It's open.
[550.76s -> 562.22s]  Let's go to the Red Sox one, the Super Bowl.
[562.95s -> 566.55s]  I can't believe the Red Sox one again, dude, if I sell both of my starting swords
[567.91s -> 572.39s]  and they are Diablo a fight, mythical burning, falling star beasts
[572.39s -> 578.15s]  of piety requires 60 strength and 54 in and 32 decks.
[578.23s -> 583.51s]  I am never equipping these. Okay.
[585.03s -> 588.79s]  We need to get like item. Well, we didn't, well, we have items
[588.79s -> 592.62s]  because items have random stats on them too. Rare.
[592.62s -> 598.12s]  Does it have, do the items have like stats? Okay. This is mind plus one.
[598.68s -> 605.40s]  All right. So gear has actual stats on it. Increases stamina regen by 8%.
[606.52s -> 611.75s]  Okay. Yeah. You look ridiculous.
[613.35s -> 616.95s]  Yeah. And I believe they have random ashes of war because it's just scream.
[616.95s -> 623.88s]  Can you even, can you swing them? All right. So what, what's, what's
[624.52s -> 628.36s]  plan number one is, do we look up screenshots of how to pick a class?
[629.56s -> 631.48s]  I don't know that there's any. All right. All right.
[632.28s -> 633.96s]  Is anybody, can somebody please help us?
[636.26s -> 640.50s]  It was working, but it's not working in the specific mod load order,
[641.59s -> 646.15s]  but we kind of had to stop, you know? Yeah. We had to, we had to turn the stream on.
[646.15s -> 648.47s]  So, all right. If I want to play warlock.
[651.48s -> 654.28s]  Well, I know that they all cost a hundred souls.
[654.28s -> 658.52s]  Okay. So we should at least, you should at the very least sell something and have a hundred.
[659.16s -> 663.43s]  What is it? So that you can potentially accidentally buy.
[663.43s -> 665.35s]  I already don't worry about anything.
[666.47s -> 670.95s]  Both of these swords are worth 15,000. I ain't selling.
[671.99s -> 680.65s]  Okay. So I have enough to, to pick a class. I want the warlock. I, because I want to,
[680.65s -> 688.62s]  I want the frenzy flame shit to be more powerful. So which one of these is pick class?
[689.61s -> 694.57s]  First one, the third one, second one, first, third, second one.
[696.57s -> 698.41s]  How would you, your chat's just going to guess.
[698.41s -> 702.41s]  Stop saying no elf. Stop that act. We need help.
[702.41s -> 704.73s]  And here's the problem. If you do choose the,
[704.73s -> 707.69s]  apparently the branch that kills you, that those are difficulty options.
[707.69s -> 711.13s]  So you may accidentally change the game difficulty to like hardcore.
[713.61s -> 728.02s]  Okay. Wait, wait, one, somebody said one, two, one, two, one, one, wait, one, two, one.
[728.02s -> 735.80s]  Good luck dog. One, this gotta be a way to fucking know this.
[735.80s -> 747.13s]  One, two, yeah, we need an Oracle effigy.
[747.13s -> 747.85s]  All right. Yeah. That's what,
[747.85s -> 751.53s]  that's what you buy from this. Normally there would be a shop here to buy them.
[751.53s -> 755.96s]  So, but there's no shop. I mean,
[758.07s -> 763.18s]  that is too silly. Sorry, bud. We can't help you.
[763.18s -> 769.43s]  Well, they changed it. This is an older version of reforged
[769.43s -> 776.65s]  so that it could work with Diablo loot. Well, look, let's just go. Let's just go.
[778.25s -> 783.29s]  Somebody will figure it out. I don't think, I don't think anyone's
[783.29s -> 787.29s]  going to figure it out. Well, we, we, we have gear right now.
[787.29s -> 790.33s]  We can go at least go kill like Margaret or something.
[791.58s -> 805.46s]  Yeah. Man. Oh man. What a, what a nice day out in Limgrave.
[807.06s -> 812.62s]  You want to go to the, where are you going? I'm just, I was just going to walk into like
[812.62s -> 816.86s]  one of these random directions. Oh, well we need the horse millennia
[817.99s -> 827.53s]  Melinda. So anything can drop Diablo loot or everything.
[827.53s -> 832.34s]  There is no more regular items in this game. There are regular items.
[832.34s -> 841.67s]  And then there's also Diablo items. There's a lot of things.
[850.34s -> 856.44s]  This does pretty good damage. I don't have nearly the stats for this.
[856.44s -> 871.82s]  And I one-shot that enemy. So pretty good. It's like a phantom.
[871.82s -> 874.54s]  Yeah. And apparently I'm like stealing their souls.
[875.10s -> 876.54s]  What? I don't know.
[877.98s -> 880.62s]  Are we classes that we don't know what they are?
[883.66s -> 887.82s]  Do we accidentally pick classes by killing ourselves with the thing a few times?
[888.38s -> 891.90s]  Our starting equipment has mods on it from Diablo mod.
[892.46s -> 894.30s]  Oh, right. Right. Right.
[895.86s -> 900.02s]  Okay. Yeah. My armor strengthens golden order incantations by 10%.
[900.66s -> 908.38s]  And I probably have something that is healing me.
[909.10s -> 915.54s]  Oh my God. This weapon. No, don't please. Don't kill me.
[915.54s -> 917.78s]  Yeah. My helmet restores health on kill.
[918.74s -> 920.74s]  It seems like it works. Even if you kill something.
[925.10s -> 938.74s]  Ooh, I did some damage. Oh my God. I'm dead.
[938.74s -> 950.68s]  What happens when I die? Oh God. What did you die to?
[950.76s -> 956.73s]  No, but I'm poisoned. I mean, it's coming close.
[956.73s -> 958.73s]  Can I respawn here? I'm getting the bonfire.
[967.94s -> 969.86s]  Whoa. I think my game crashed.
[970.58s -> 973.94s]  Oh, I rested the bonfire and it's the Molina cut scene.
[973.94s -> 976.50s]  So maybe your game did crash. Oh, it just pulled me to you.
[976.50s -> 984.36s]  No, you're not. Give me one second.
[985.00s -> 986.60s]  Just talking to me about feet. I don't.
[988.09s -> 992.17s]  I do see the subs, but what I want to tell you is that's way too much.
[993.42s -> 997.99s]  I really appreciate it. But one of the reasons why I don't like to address subs
[997.99s -> 1001.03s]  is I feel like it encourages it. And that's a lot of money.
[1001.03s -> 1005.91s]  That's way too much money. That's way too much money to be giving
[1005.91s -> 1011.56s]  an individual streamer like me. So I do appreciate anybody supporting this stream,
[1011.56s -> 1016.42s]  but that's way too much. Thank you so much.
[1016.42s -> 1019.69s]  But that is, I would say that is enough. That's a lot.
[1022.15s -> 1026.15s]  That is far too much to give one individual person, especially me.
[1026.95s -> 1029.91s]  Especially me. So please just be careful.
[1029.99s -> 1034.71s]  Do not put yourself in financial burden. Do not give this stream money,
[1034.71s -> 1037.59s]  because you think even if you think, even if you think I deserve it,
[1040.73s -> 1042.41s]  you guys take such good care of me already.
[1042.97s -> 1048.41s]  No one individual has to give like hundreds or thousands of subs.
[1048.41s -> 1054.26s]  I really appreciate it, but I don't think that worked.
[1057.53s -> 1062.33s]  But one of the reasons why I don't address subs is because I don't want to encourage people
[1062.33s -> 1065.69s]  to get into this loop where they give so many.
[1065.69s -> 1069.11s]  It's something I don't like to encourage,
[1069.11s -> 1071.45s]  because I don't want it to be something that people think that they should do too.
[1072.01s -> 1076.33s]  So that's all I'm going to say about it. I appreciate anything that anybody does
[1076.33s -> 1078.65s]  to this channel. Please take care of yourself.
[1078.65s -> 1081.74s]  Don't give me that much money. Give me five bucks a month.
[1082.86s -> 1085.82s]  That's your decision if you want to pay five bucks a month to this channel.
[1085.82s -> 1094.74s]  You absolutely do not have to, but I don't like to encourage subs, if that makes any sense.
[1094.74s -> 1098.42s]  I would rather you spend that money on something in your life.
[1098.42s -> 1100.50s]  Maybe on some other smaller streamers.
[1100.50s -> 1104.22s]  Not me. Do not give me a thousand subs individually.
[1104.22s -> 1107.85s]  I'm just going to tell you.
[1107.85s -> 1110.42s]  Thank you so much, everybody.
[1110.42s -> 1111.30s]  Now we game.
[1111.30s -> 1114.60s]  Did Elden ring mods?
[1115.16s -> 1117.69s]  Yeah, I turned on an option.
[1118.65s -> 1120.84s]  Can you rest of the bonfire again?
[1120.84s -> 1129.77s]  What'd you do?
[1129.77s -> 1130.41s]  Hold on.
[1130.41s -> 1131.21s]  Okay.
[1131.21s -> 1135.90s]  I turned on the option that always to spectate you after dying.
[1136.38s -> 1143.16s]  I have seen these menus before and I realized that I stumbled onto the correct option,
[1143.16s -> 1146.49s]  but I don't know if we both need to turn that option on.
[1146.49s -> 1150.97s]  So for me, when I die, I will not respawn ever until you touch a bonfire.
[1153.80s -> 1156.52s]  I can guide you if we both have to have it.
[1156.52s -> 1161.00s]  So where do I go from here?
[1161.00s -> 1162.84s]  The bottom event text for talk.
[1166.02s -> 1169.06s]  Wait, was this? I don't remember.
[1169.06s -> 1170.34s]  I don't want to touch anything.
[1170.90s -> 1172.26s]  Let me just get my horse.
[1173.53s -> 1176.09s]  Well, we'll see how I think I know which one it is.
[1178.30s -> 1179.98s]  Three, two, one, two, three, three.
[1179.98s -> 1181.75s]  Stop saying numbers.
[1181.75s -> 1183.11s]  Three, two, three, three, three.
[1193.08s -> 1194.84s]  Okay, I've got torrent.
[1202.44s -> 1203.16s]  You level up.
[1204.71s -> 1208.79s]  I died, so I don't have any I don't have any crunchies.
[1213.94s -> 1214.74s]  No crunchies.
[1215.69s -> 1216.19s]  Okay.
[1216.65s -> 1219.21s]  I mean, you want to grab the items from around here.
[1220.65s -> 1222.49s]  I think that's probably let me wait.
[1222.49s -> 1223.37s]  Let me get this on the bar.
[1224.17s -> 1230.30s]  Wait, how come?
[1230.30s -> 1231.14s]  There it is.
[1231.14s -> 1237.91s]  Okay, move that switch.
[1237.91s -> 1239.77s]  Okay, there it is.
[1241.18s -> 1244.54s]  All right, I don't have any crunchies, so you can level up.
[1244.54s -> 1245.18s]  Okay, wait, wait.
[1245.18s -> 1246.38s]  No, come to the bonfire.
[1246.38s -> 1247.10s]  I know which one it is.
[1251.98s -> 1253.82s]  The bottom event text for talk.
[1255.48s -> 1256.28s]  Okay.
[1256.28s -> 1259.96s]  And then the second from the bottom event text for talk.
[1259.96s -> 1260.46s]  Okay.
[1260.92s -> 1261.80s]  And then yes.
[1261.80s -> 1262.84s]  And what is this doing?
[1263.48s -> 1266.36s]  That is whenever you die, you are forced into spectator mode.
[1267.00s -> 1267.50s]  Okay.
[1269.16s -> 1269.64s]  Nice.
[1269.64s -> 1270.36s]  I activated it.
[1270.36s -> 1271.66s]  I didn't die.
[1271.66s -> 1272.16s]  Yeah.
[1274.50s -> 1278.58s]  And the one below that is when either of us dies, we both die.
[1278.58s -> 1280.10s]  So don't touch that one.
[1282.07s -> 1284.07s]  Unless you want us to be soul linked.
[1284.07s -> 1285.35s]  I don't think that's a good thing.
[1285.35s -> 1286.79s]  That's probably a bad idea.
[1288.15s -> 1289.27s]  I mean, I would.
[1289.27s -> 1290.39s]  All right, we ready?
[1290.39s -> 1292.15s]  Pay a lot of money to be soul linked.
[1292.15s -> 1292.95s]  All right, let's go.
[1300.07s -> 1300.57s]  Help me.
[1304.70s -> 1305.98s]  What does it look like I'm doing?
[1306.78s -> 1307.82s]  Missing every swing.
[1308.54s -> 1314.01s]  Okay.
[1314.79s -> 1317.59s]  Oh, yeah, the items are not going to be randomized.
[1317.59s -> 1320.95s]  It's just I don't know where Diablo items spawn.
[1320.95s -> 1323.11s]  Like that was a talisman of fury.
[1323.11s -> 1323.67s]  I don't.
[1323.67s -> 1325.83s]  Do you know what would have been so cool?
[1325.83s -> 1328.39s]  If if when I joined the game, a little.
[1329.19s -> 1332.71s]  And this is just like funny things that they could have added on the bottom.
[1332.71s -> 1336.71s]  Like a little text pop up that says so and so has joined your game.
[1336.71s -> 1338.79s]  Diablo's minions grow stronger.
[1343.40s -> 1344.60s]  Did you even get that item?
[1345.16s -> 1345.48s]  What?
[1345.48s -> 1347.56s]  You just you're just running in a random direction again.
[1347.56s -> 1348.36s]  Wait, what happened?
[1348.36s -> 1349.24s]  It was a where where?
[1350.04s -> 1351.00s]  Well, like you.
[1351.00s -> 1352.52s]  Oh, yeah, right, right, right, right, right.
[1352.52s -> 1353.40s]  You can loot this.
[1353.40s -> 1356.92s]  We can we can go down and get the thing that lets you apply ashes of wars.
[1356.92s -> 1358.28s]  And it's a really important item.
[1358.28s -> 1362.44s]  If the items aren't randomized, we should probably get that frost long sword.
[1363.32s -> 1366.84s]  Oh, yeah, then our Diablo loot is different because I got a talisman from there.
[1366.84s -> 1368.04s]  Well, all right, take a look.
[1368.04s -> 1371.64s]  Hey, hey, take a look at this then, because you were a magic.
[1372.52s -> 1374.20s]  I don't know how to drop it.
[1374.20s -> 1375.24s]  Where is it?
[1375.24s -> 1376.28s]  It's dead.
[1376.28s -> 1377.08s]  Don't delete it.
[1377.80s -> 1379.85s]  Watch out, bird.
[1385.06s -> 1387.78s]  So the difference between this one and the last time we played this.
[1388.42s -> 1389.62s]  OK, it's leaving.
[1389.62s -> 1390.34s]  All right, well, whatever.
[1391.29s -> 1396.98s]  So this is a new seed and it's the best enemy in the game.
[1399.19s -> 1400.15s]  My jumping higher.
[1402.49s -> 1406.25s]  Maybe there's a lot of there's a lot of very small changes.
[1406.25s -> 1411.16s]  You might notice like sitting at the the bonfire.
[1411.80s -> 1414.12s]  The animation is quicker in reforged.
[1414.12s -> 1414.68s]  It is.
[1414.68s -> 1415.00s]  All right.
[1415.00s -> 1416.84s]  So let me let me level up.
[1416.84s -> 1419.48s]  And I believe your jump animation starts sooner.
[1420.79s -> 1423.05s]  So there's a lot of tiny things.
[1423.05s -> 1423.93s]  Well, I definitely need this.
[1423.93s -> 1425.21s]  So I'm going to put it in there.
[1425.21s -> 1430.47s]  So are we just trying to get to let's do one of the little dungeons over here.
[1430.47s -> 1432.07s]  Let's like, yeah, let's go for it.
[1432.07s -> 1433.27s]  Yeah, let's respawn the enemies again.
[1433.99s -> 1436.39s]  Let's like kill one enemy and then like let's respawn them again.
[1436.39s -> 1437.19s]  Well, I had to level up.
[1437.19s -> 1437.99s]  You told me to level up.
[1438.71s -> 1440.55s]  OK, well, I had to not level up.
[1440.55s -> 1443.03s]  OK, so let's kill let's kill the crab again.
[1443.75s -> 1446.23s]  No, just get on your horse and let's go to the place we need to go.
[1446.23s -> 1447.59s]  Well, no, there's the done.
[1447.59s -> 1449.19s]  Come back right now.
[1449.75s -> 1451.11s]  Get back here right now.
[1451.11s -> 1452.55s]  There's the catacomb in this area.
[1452.55s -> 1455.43s]  Oh, there is sword that you need to use ashes of war.
[1463.53s -> 1465.37s]  We have to have like the big enemies spawn here.
[1466.17s -> 1471.53s]  Yes, this this this ant is a boss.
[1471.53s -> 1472.33s]  Where even am I?
[1473.82s -> 1477.19s]  Whoa, valid questions.
[1478.94s -> 1481.70s]  Whoa, I'm going to die.
[1481.70s -> 1483.54s]  Bro, you're getting three fingered.
[1484.70s -> 1486.70s]  You can't use that until I actually have the power.
[1487.34s -> 1487.74s]  OK.
[1490.33s -> 1492.49s]  Oh, you just got to Claude.
[1497.16s -> 1498.92s]  Wait, why can I do this?
[1499.98s -> 1503.50s]  Your sword's ashes of war is going to be randomized with the album.
[1503.50s -> 1504.46s]  What the fuck?
[1505.26s -> 1507.18s]  Yeah, so this one is the stab myself.
[1509.05s -> 1511.13s]  I got the kill yourself poison sword.
[1512.09s -> 1519.24s]  Jesus treasured furious.
[1523.27s -> 1523.91s]  Holy shit.
[1523.91s -> 1524.47s]  OK, hold on.
[1525.11s -> 1530.15s]  Plus one holy damage percent plus one extra magic damage taken.
[1531.59s -> 1533.35s]  I said that so badly.
[1534.15s -> 1536.47s]  One extra damage.
[1536.47s -> 1537.83s]  It's like a two year old.
[1538.81s -> 1542.41s]  I take extra magic damage.
[1542.41s -> 1544.74s]  Look, look, daddy.
[1545.46s -> 1546.82s]  Look, daddy, magic damage.
[1547.54s -> 1548.94s]  Daddy, look.
[1549.90s -> 1551.34s]  And then the dad never looks.
[1552.68s -> 1553.96s]  Bro, come on.
[1554.92s -> 1561.58s]  Oh, also, another thing I know is it's easier to to deplete poison enemies
[1561.58s -> 1563.34s]  because they don't regenerate it as quickly.
[1564.06s -> 1566.71s]  Give me one sec.
[1566.71s -> 1570.55s]  Move this out of the way, move this out of the way, move this out of the way.
[1573.77s -> 1575.77s]  Oh, fuck, please don't kill me.
[1575.77s -> 1576.66s]  I'm hyping.
[1577.46s -> 1581.53s]  I mean, you you you stop moving in the middle of Main Street.
[1582.41s -> 1584.81s]  For some reason, I think there was going to be anything over here.
[1585.53s -> 1587.51s]  I thought like we killed it all.
[1588.15s -> 1601.56s]  That thing is so bad.
[1602.79s -> 1604.63s]  Dude, stop swinging.
[1604.63s -> 1605.19s]  Can you help me?
[1605.75s -> 1606.55s]  I'm going to die.
[1606.55s -> 1607.51s]  No, I am.
[1607.51s -> 1608.63s]  I probably am going to die, too.
[1609.27s -> 1610.58s]  Let's just reset it.
[1610.58s -> 1611.62s]  Let's just come back here.
[1611.62s -> 1613.46s]  No, we killed everything.
[1621.22s -> 1622.82s]  Please, please don't do it.
[1624.10s -> 1624.58s]  I'm helping.
[1624.58s -> 1624.98s]  I'm coming.
[1624.98s -> 1626.18s]  This thing's going to kill you.
[1626.18s -> 1628.34s]  He's the last thing we got to kill.
[1628.34s -> 1629.30s]  Well, let's ignore him then.
[1629.30s -> 1629.78s]  Come over here.
[1629.78s -> 1631.06s]  We just got to go in the basement.
[1633.94s -> 1634.26s]  Fuck.
[1634.26s -> 1635.54s]  I thought I could keep him staggered.
[1635.54s -> 1635.86s]  I'm dead.
[1637.72s -> 1638.68s]  I said ignore him.
[1638.68s -> 1641.16s]  I know, but you're going to die in the basement over there.
[1641.16s -> 1642.76s]  There's no enemy in here.
[1642.76s -> 1643.72s]  That's just a chest.
[1648.09s -> 1648.89s]  Well, whatever.
[1648.89s -> 1650.30s]  It doesn't matter.
[1650.30s -> 1652.86s]  It really kind of does.
[1652.86s -> 1653.98s]  You shouldn't downplay.
[1653.98s -> 1659.32s]  It matters that you're dead.
[1659.32s -> 1659.56s]  All right.
[1659.56s -> 1660.60s]  I got to get a lot of people.
[1660.60s -> 1662.44s]  I got to get I got to get into the swing of things here.
[1663.00s -> 1678.92s]  OK, you respond.
[1681.29s -> 1681.77s]  I'm back.
[1686.73s -> 1687.29s]  Don't die.
[1688.09s -> 1696.15s]  OK, let's fight the crab.
[1698.57s -> 1699.93s]  No, we're going up.
[1699.93s -> 1700.65s]  Let's do what you said.
[1700.65s -> 1702.41s]  Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid.
[1703.56s -> 1714.90s]  But yeah.
[1715.90s -> 1720.22s]  I'm avoiding that should.
[1720.22s -> 1722.71s]  I don't even know how that hit me straight from here.
[1722.71s -> 1723.19s]  Follow me.
[1725.32s -> 1725.72s]  Cave.
[1726.73s -> 1732.50s]  Yeah, in in going in cave in cave.
[1737.98s -> 1739.90s]  OK, the whetstone knife.
[1740.54s -> 1741.70s]  Perfect.
[1742.26s -> 1744.18s]  Pretty good piece of equipment there.
[1747.61s -> 1749.53s]  Uncommon magic moon veil.
[1750.33s -> 1752.07s]  So what are the rarities?
[1752.07s -> 1753.67s]  Is it is a common uncommon?
[1753.67s -> 1755.43s]  I have like an ancestral.
[1755.43s -> 1756.31s]  It's Diablo.
[1756.31s -> 1759.11s]  So I imagine it's Diablo.
[1760.76s -> 1762.20s]  But also, I don't know.
[1762.20s -> 1763.40s]  I actually think they were kind of weird.
[1763.40s -> 1765.32s]  There's like a like above legendary.
[1765.32s -> 1767.00s]  There's like epic super ultra mythic.
[1768.12s -> 1771.37s]  And then there's a beyond good and evil.
[1774.65s -> 1775.61s]  That can never come out.
[1776.33s -> 1778.90s]  No, it didn't.
[1781.59s -> 1783.59s]  The second one was like really supposed to be coming out, right?
[1784.79s -> 1785.11s]  Yeah.
[1785.11s -> 1788.31s]  But then they started trying to outsource their game to random people to make.
[1788.87s -> 1790.71s]  And then I haven't heard anything about it since then.
[1791.99s -> 1792.94s]  All right.
[1792.94s -> 1793.58s]  So we're good.
[1794.14s -> 1795.18s]  We got what we needed from here.
[1795.90s -> 1798.17s]  Ready to rock and roll?
[1799.77s -> 1800.97s]  Rock and roll in which direction?
[1802.49s -> 1804.01s]  My what we should do.
[1804.01s -> 1805.13s]  Here's what I'm going to propose.
[1806.54s -> 1807.18s]  Summer jail.
[1807.74s -> 1809.22s]  Summer jail.
[1809.22s -> 1810.50s]  Storm but not summer.
[1812.10s -> 1813.14s]  Today is a lizard.
[1813.14s -> 1813.86s]  Just a little off.
[1816.10s -> 1817.78s]  It's that's I read the S.
[1819.14s -> 1819.46s]  Jail.
[1822.25s -> 1824.33s]  I'm very confused on where we're going.
[1824.97s -> 1826.81s]  I want to go to the ever jail.
[1827.45s -> 1827.85s]  Hold on.
[1828.65s -> 1828.97s]  Okay.
[1835.90s -> 1836.22s]  Okay.
[1837.38s -> 1839.62s]  Storm Hill ever jail.
[1839.62s -> 1841.30s]  Not summer jail.
[1843.00s -> 1843.88s]  It's behind us.
[1847.03s -> 1847.75s]  Can we go up?
[1847.75s -> 1849.51s]  Oh, no, we have to go through Stormville Castle.
[1849.51s -> 1849.75s]  Okay.
[1856.65s -> 1860.17s]  So you would go up that hill and then you turn around and hook left.
[1860.17s -> 1867.83s]  Yeah, we could just go game progress or we could try to wrap around there.
[1869.88s -> 1871.64s]  I mean, remember, we're like level zero.
[1873.16s -> 1877.80s]  I know that you got spoiled last run and you got like five remembrances by this point.
[1877.80s -> 1878.04s]  Right.
[1878.04s -> 1879.96s]  But you're actually very low level right now.
[1879.96s -> 1880.76s]  Did you jump off?
[1881.96s -> 1882.52s]  I went down here.
[1883.32s -> 1886.46s]  I mean, we really you know what it is.
[1886.46s -> 1888.78s]  The map is revealed and it's like freaking me out.
[1888.78s -> 1890.94s]  Like being able to see literally every single thing in the game.
[1891.82s -> 1894.02s]  Like, I don't know what I don't know where to go
[1894.02s -> 1896.26s]  because my brain's like look at every single thing is here.
[1897.38s -> 1901.78s]  Would you like to be to mode it?
[1902.94s -> 1904.30s]  I think we just go up here.
[1905.18s -> 1905.58s]  Okay.
[1906.14s -> 1914.92s]  What a mess.
[1920.44s -> 1921.64s]  Oh, my God.
[1921.64s -> 1922.68s]  What the fuck is that?
[1923.24s -> 1932.82s]  Okay.
[1932.90s -> 1935.02s]  Did I birdie good?
[1936.22s -> 1936.54s]  Yeah.
[1936.54s -> 1938.06s]  So we could let's try to fight whatever this is.
[1938.94s -> 1940.30s]  There's got to be a bonfire right here, right?
[1941.80s -> 1942.04s]  No.
[1942.04s -> 1944.68s]  But if you die in here, it just puts you here, doesn't it?
[1945.40s -> 1947.08s]  As long as we say the statue.
[1948.12s -> 1948.36s]  Yeah.
[1949.00s -> 1949.24s]  Yeah.
[1949.24s -> 1950.12s]  Statue right there.
[1955.02s -> 1956.22s]  Let's go into the summer jail.
[1958.52s -> 1967.14s]  It was the storm hill ever jail storm jail some real jail.
[1967.14s -> 1968.50s]  The words just mixed together.
[1969.74s -> 1970.94s]  Well, that should be easy.
[1971.66s -> 1975.74s]  Listen, this is a good fight to do to fear like I load it into the game.
[1975.74s -> 1976.22s]  Let's go.
[1977.26s -> 1979.82s]  We're so dead.
[1980.38s -> 1986.26s]  Is there a phase two as well?
[1987.56s -> 1988.12s]  Probably.
[1988.76s -> 1994.94s]  Okay.
[1994.94s -> 1995.34s]  Good luck.
[2003.96s -> 2004.44s]  Where are they?
[2005.24s -> 2014.60s]  Are they?
[2014.60s -> 2015.24s]  Where'd he go?
[2016.20s -> 2016.92s]  Where did who go?
[2019.74s -> 2021.10s]  Wait, are you coming back in?
[2022.15s -> 2023.35s]  No, I died.
[2023.91s -> 2025.91s]  I just died too, but it's not.
[2026.47s -> 2026.71s]  Okay.
[2027.11s -> 2042.04s]  I'm not going to touch a bonfire.
[2042.04s -> 2042.28s]  Yeah.
[2046.73s -> 2048.41s]  You feeling okay?
[2052.92s -> 2056.12s]  I mean, if you saw my screen, you'd be pretty confused.
[2058.70s -> 2064.68s]  I got a bike's war sphere, which is well, probably it won't have the same ash of war
[2065.94s -> 2067.14s]  on my screen right now.
[2067.14s -> 2075.69s]  You are in the ever jail still and summer in the summer summer hill.
[2075.69s -> 2077.77s]  I think I was going to say summer hill jail.
[2078.41s -> 2082.47s]  I don't know why this is the S blended into the other word.
[2085.34s -> 2086.54s]  I touched a bonfire.
[2086.54s -> 2087.26s]  Are you okay?
[2088.22s -> 2089.26s]  I am back alive.
[2096.23s -> 2097.99s]  Did you respond at the stake?
[2097.99s -> 2099.83s]  I respond at the stake near the jail.
[2100.47s -> 2103.11s]  I would recommend coming up here to the bonfire
[2103.11s -> 2105.35s]  because there's a charge to your flask along the way.
[2106.47s -> 2112.30s]  Um, and I don't think that we should be picking fights like spawning into the game
[2112.30s -> 2116.30s]  and then fighting Godfrey Godford fry in the summer jails.
[2116.30s -> 2116.54s]  No.
[2118.30s -> 2118.54s]  Okay.
[2119.10s -> 2121.50s]  So let me get my souls.
[2122.30s -> 2126.42s]  Did I even have any souls?
[2127.82s -> 2128.70s]  Probably not.
[2132.68s -> 2133.40s]  I had 2000.
[2133.96s -> 2134.20s]  All right.
[2134.20s -> 2134.76s]  I'm coming to you.
[2137.13s -> 2140.25s]  I mean, there also is always the chance that we go to fight Morgoth.
[2140.25s -> 2144.41s]  And it like really now because the randomizer is a little bit more random.
[2145.21s -> 2146.65s]  We could be getting that mad soldier.
[2147.61s -> 2150.58s]  Oh, I would love that.
[2151.96s -> 2158.79s]  Or or or whoa.
[2158.79s -> 2159.27s]  Wait a minute.
[2159.91s -> 2163.16s]  I just got like I got like a legendary thing.
[2163.16s -> 2163.48s]  Hold on.
[2165.78s -> 2171.86s]  Rare bolt charge dragon communion seal of the something.
[2172.66s -> 2174.81s]  Okay.
[2175.53s -> 2179.06s]  What the hell?
[2179.06s -> 2180.90s]  I got like a rare legendary helmet.
[2182.36s -> 2184.84s]  Night sorceries by 30% strengthen them.
[2184.84s -> 2185.40s]  Holy shit.
[2187.30s -> 2188.34s]  Are you going to use sorcerers at all?
[2189.34s -> 2190.46s]  I have no idea what I'm doing.
[2191.38s -> 2197.32s]  I kind of had a plan, but then, uh, we die if we try and do anything.
[2197.32s -> 2197.64s]  All right.
[2198.92s -> 2199.80s]  With this, what happened?
[2200.92s -> 2205.37s]  I thought you touched another thing.
[2205.37s -> 2205.61s]  Okay.
[2206.41s -> 2208.89s]  You know, it's the complexity of these mods can creasing.
[2209.61s -> 2213.80s]  Okay.
[2213.80s -> 2214.52s]  There you go.
[2214.52s -> 2225.19s]  I feel like this is probably not even as good as it's not.
[2228.01s -> 2228.41s]  All right.
[2229.80s -> 2232.36s]  So we have a million options.
[2232.36s -> 2235.64s]  Option number one is to just go fight whoever's up there.
[2235.64s -> 2239.64s]  Like you said, option number two is to go check out, you know, one of the shacks.
[2240.20s -> 2246.60s]  I think we should do some of the easier catacombs and get some more random mythic items and level
[2246.60s -> 2249.96s]  up because it requires 60 strength to use my weapons that I currently have.
[2249.96s -> 2252.84s]  I basically have nothing.
[2252.84s -> 2254.68s]  So then let's go do one of the catacombs.
[2255.24s -> 2257.00s]  Yeah, we don't have any smithing stones.
[2257.80s -> 2259.64s]  We don't have anything.
[2259.64s -> 2263.16s]  Remember we played this recently and we were pretty strong.
[2263.16s -> 2265.40s]  Uh, we're not, we don't have anything.
[2265.96s -> 2266.20s]  Yeah.
[2266.20s -> 2269.16s]  I think it could, because we just did randomizer and we just did this.
[2269.16s -> 2272.04s]  My brain's almost like, oh, oh wait, we're new characters.
[2272.04s -> 2276.84s]  You're blaming a lot of this on your brain, but I feel like you are the one in control
[2276.84s -> 2277.40s]  of your brain.
[2280.71s -> 2281.35s]  You ate meat.
[2281.35s -> 2282.31s]  That was over 16 hours.
[2282.31s -> 2283.03s]  You don't get to say anything.
[2286.07s -> 2289.61s]  And I lived and I was fine.
[2293.99s -> 2295.75s]  Isn't there a merchant man in here?
[2295.75s -> 2296.31s]  I think so.
[2297.13s -> 2297.93s]  And then up the road.
[2297.93s -> 2299.21s]  Some ways there's a catacomb.
[2307.50s -> 2307.74s]  All right.
[2307.74s -> 2308.86s]  Where did, okay.
[2308.86s -> 2309.66s]  Bernard.
[2309.66s -> 2310.54s]  What should we say to Bernard?
[2311.26s -> 2312.18s]  What do you mean?
[2313.78s -> 2315.22s]  Should we say my faith holds firm?
[2315.78s -> 2316.26s]  Yeah, sure.
[2316.26s -> 2317.46s]  My faith is firm.
[2317.46s -> 2318.98s]  I'm pretty fucking firm right now.
[2324.79s -> 2325.91s]  Ash of War.
[2325.91s -> 2326.63s]  No skill.
[2328.95s -> 2332.30s]  Um, yeah, I know a lot of this stuff too.
[2332.30s -> 2336.94s]  I know like the kick got buffed, like a lot of stuff that would normally be kind of bad
[2336.94s -> 2338.54s]  got buffed with reforged.
[2339.42s -> 2340.22s]  Hmm.
[2340.22s -> 2344.73s]  So I'm going to buy kick and use that instead of stab myself.
[2345.45s -> 2346.65s]  I have fire on mine.
[2348.65s -> 2349.29s]  Actually on this.
[2350.90s -> 2351.54s]  That's kind of cool.
[2360.78s -> 2361.58s]  Huh.
[2361.58s -> 2365.05s]  It won't let me change anything.
[2365.69s -> 2367.62s]  What do you mean?
[2368.26s -> 2369.19s]  I don't know.
[2369.19s -> 2371.67s]  None of my weapons are showing up in the ashes of war.
[2372.39s -> 2375.35s]  So maybe Diablo items are like hard set.
[2375.35s -> 2376.87s]  You might find them.
[2376.87s -> 2378.79s]  Is it possible you can change them out at the blacksmith?
[2380.81s -> 2382.41s]  Uh, I don't know.
[2382.41s -> 2384.41s]  It should be the same exact mechanic.
[2385.29s -> 2391.83s]  You need an item to change them.
[2391.83s -> 2392.31s]  Okay.
[2392.31s -> 2393.27s]  We have to have an item.
[2393.27s -> 2394.63s]  That's what we got in that basement.
[2394.63s -> 2396.23s]  I thought was the whetstone blade.
[2397.43s -> 2399.11s]  Don't you have to have a blacksmith do it anyways, though?
[2399.75s -> 2401.35s]  I don't think so.
[2402.07s -> 2410.71s]  Yeah, the whetblade.
[2410.71s -> 2411.19s]  We got it.
[2411.75s -> 2415.91s]  Anyway, let's, uh, let's go this way.
[2416.47s -> 2417.99s]  Yeah, we need to level up.
[2417.99s -> 2419.67s]  My health bar is so, how much health?
[2419.67s -> 2420.79s]  How much bigger do you have?
[2422.14s -> 2422.94s]  Like 14.
[2423.58s -> 2425.42s]  Diablo does not let you change them.
[2425.42s -> 2427.74s]  You can only level weapons up twice.
[2429.66s -> 2431.90s]  What do you mean when you say level weapons up?
[2431.90s -> 2433.34s]  Uh, that's I'm screening from chat.
[2433.34s -> 2434.62s]  I'm not sure what it means.
[2434.62s -> 2435.58s]  Yeah, I'm asking them.
[2436.46s -> 2437.62s]  What do they mean?
[2438.42s -> 2447.78s]  Okay.
[2447.78s -> 2450.97s]  I mean, we could see what's in Margaret's room.
[2450.97s -> 2452.81s]  Wait, like you said, what if it's a mad soldier?
[2453.45s -> 2455.21s]  There's a catacombs right up here, man.
[2456.34s -> 2458.18s]  You keep saying you don't know what you want to do.
[2458.18s -> 2459.46s]  And then we go do something.
[2459.46s -> 2461.94s]  And then you say we could go do the thing that we're not doing.
[2462.50s -> 2463.54s]  Well, we just did something.
[2464.26s -> 2469.29s]  Just calling it as I'm seeing it.
[2474.09s -> 2475.29s]  And there's a chest in here.
[2475.29s -> 2476.25s]  Do you want to open the chest?
[2476.25s -> 2480.95s]  Or you want to just immediately abandon and go to Margo?
[2482.70s -> 2489.77s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2489.77s -> 2491.05s]  Chest on table.
[2491.05s -> 2495.05s]  You left some gold in a rift in just a common side.
[2495.93s -> 2496.81s]  Look, claws.
[2497.61s -> 2499.93s]  This thing's still better.
[2500.49s -> 2507.51s]  Okay.
[2508.07s -> 2510.14s]  Did you get something good?
[2512.50s -> 2515.98s]  Uh, I got a weird war pick.
[2515.98s -> 2518.78s]  It says inflicts damage when rolling into enemies.
[2523.53s -> 2525.53s]  Oh, and these claws have vacuum slice.
[2526.55s -> 2529.27s]  These items are pretty weird.
[2530.74s -> 2532.50s]  What vacuum slice?
[2532.50s -> 2535.78s]  It's a magic hammer that deals damage when I roll on things.
[2537.14s -> 2541.38s]  Vacuum slice is the gargoyle attack that shoots like the air blast in a line.
[2542.26s -> 2547.64s]  I think that I that's what I got.
[2547.64s -> 2548.76s]  I got that air blast thing too.
[2549.48s -> 2554.78s]  Yeah, right down this road, there should be a cave.
[2556.57s -> 2557.21s]  And I'm sorry.
[2557.21s -> 2557.69s]  I'm sorry.
[2557.69s -> 2558.97s]  Like, I'm really pushing us to do it.
[2558.97s -> 2561.05s]  I know that I'm being a bit of a I don't want to do a cave.
[2561.05s -> 2561.53s]  I don't want to do.
[2561.53s -> 2564.01s]  I want to do market the whole time.
[2564.01s -> 2565.29s]  We did the last run.
[2565.29s -> 2566.57s]  I want to fight market.
[2566.57s -> 2568.81s]  We should really do some of these starting caves.
[2569.13s -> 2570.01s]  I'm just I'm kidding.
[2570.01s -> 2570.65s]  I'm kidding.
[2570.65s -> 2572.17s]  I'm I want to do the cave.
[2580.09s -> 2581.13s]  I wanted to do market.
[2581.13s -> 2582.17s]  I wanted to go to Wendy's.
[2585.94s -> 2587.14s]  Actually, let me level up first.
[2589.40s -> 2591.48s]  Is Wendy's your your fast food of choice?
[2591.48s -> 2593.40s]  When you want a chicken sandwich, where are you going?
[2593.40s -> 2593.96s]  McDonald's.
[2595.48s -> 2597.24s]  Wait, hold on.
[2598.04s -> 2600.92s]  The original McChicken from McDonald's.
[2600.92s -> 2602.60s]  Not this new spicy bullshit.
[2602.60s -> 2603.48s]  Let me be honest with you.
[2605.50s -> 2608.86s]  The original McChicken sandwich from McDonald's.
[2609.18s -> 2610.46s]  I like it a lot.
[2610.46s -> 2613.18s]  But this this new spicy McChicken that they put everywhere
[2613.18s -> 2616.06s]  and they want you so badly to order that and not the original one.
[2616.06s -> 2617.27s]  Come on.
[2617.27s -> 2618.79s]  I want the original McChicken.
[2618.79s -> 2620.87s]  I don't want the spicy powder all over it.
[2621.67s -> 2624.14s]  Do you feel me?
[2624.78s -> 2625.90s]  I I got to be honest.
[2625.90s -> 2627.58s]  I I don't really know.
[2627.58s -> 2628.70s]  I don't know much about.
[2628.70s -> 2631.26s]  I didn't even know McDonald's had chicken.
[2632.78s -> 2633.50s]  You do.
[2633.50s -> 2634.38s]  Come on.
[2634.38s -> 2635.42s]  I've never had one.
[2636.22s -> 2639.34s]  But you knew that McDonald's had chicken on the menu.
[2640.14s -> 2641.50s]  I know that they have chicken nuggets.
[2643.66s -> 2644.86s]  Well, that I mean, that counts.
[2645.90s -> 2652.36s]  I didn't know that McDonald's had chicken.
[2653.08s -> 2655.78s]  That's like saying I didn't know that Campbell's had soup.
[2657.21s -> 2657.93s]  Hold on.
[2657.93s -> 2658.81s]  Hold on a second.
[2659.61s -> 2660.09s]  One guy.
[2664.10s -> 2665.70s]  OK, never mind.
[2665.70s -> 2666.74s]  It's a weird comment.
[2666.74s -> 2670.02s]  And it was just stir healthy and based.
[2670.02s -> 2673.94s]  He doesn't know McDonald's has chicken, therefore healthy and based.
[2676.15s -> 2676.79s]  I like that.
[2680.86s -> 2681.34s]  I don't know.
[2681.34s -> 2685.26s]  Like, there's so many places now that like specifically would call themselves
[2685.26s -> 2686.94s]  like we're chicken places.
[2686.94s -> 2690.14s]  So for you to pick McDonald's to be the best chicken sandwiches.
[2690.14s -> 2690.54s]  I don't know.
[2690.54s -> 2691.10s]  It surprised me.
[2691.10s -> 2693.82s]  I didn't even know that they did it because I haven't been in a McDonald's in a long time.
[2693.82s -> 2695.42s]  The thing is, I went to a McDonald's.
[2695.42s -> 2700.22s]  It was the only ones I've really went to are like New York, like in the subway.
[2700.22s -> 2701.58s]  This guy's really hard, by the way.
[2704.78s -> 2705.82s]  He's going to kill you in one hit.
[2711.51s -> 2713.48s]  Healthy and based.
[2713.48s -> 2717.29s]  Well, I didn't say here's the thing.
[2717.29s -> 2718.57s]  Oh, my God, my game crashed.
[2719.94s -> 2721.06s]  That's not fair.
[2721.06s -> 2721.94s]  It's not fair.
[2721.94s -> 2724.42s]  I didn't say that it's not the best.
[2724.42s -> 2728.10s]  I don't think it's the best chicken sandwich, but it hits pretty well.
[2729.38s -> 2730.74s]  That was the question, though.
[2730.74s -> 2734.58s]  Yeah, but it kind of is the best for me, even though it's not quality wise.
[2734.58s -> 2736.02s]  It's not the best sandwich.
[2736.02s -> 2738.90s]  I would say for me, I prefer.
[2739.70s -> 2745.24s]  Oh, that's not good.
[2745.24s -> 2745.96s]  What's not good?
[2747.54s -> 2748.66s]  It didn't open three times.
[2748.66s -> 2749.06s]  Hold on.
[2752.90s -> 2755.70s]  Is this you just acting out that you don't want to do this cave?
[2758.30s -> 2764.52s]  That would be actually pretty funny.
[2764.52s -> 2768.94s]  But no, the issue is McDonald's.
[2768.94s -> 2771.54s]  You know exactly what you're getting every time.
[2771.54s -> 2773.32s]  It's incredibly consistent.
[2773.32s -> 2775.72s]  A McChicken from McDonald's is the same McChicken
[2776.44s -> 2778.12s]  that has been to the last 10 years.
[2778.12s -> 2779.96s]  But unfortunately, now they added the spicy shit on it.
[2780.60s -> 2782.84s]  So it's not consistent.
[2782.84s -> 2784.28s]  Unfortunately, it's not consistent.
[2787.83s -> 2791.11s]  Well, I mean, in a way, that backs up your argument
[2791.11s -> 2795.40s]  that they changed something one time and it upset you
[2795.40s -> 2797.16s]  that they should have been consistent.
[2797.16s -> 2798.94s]  They should have been.
[2798.94s -> 2799.18s]  All right.
[2799.18s -> 2801.42s]  Normally, they are back.
[2801.42s -> 2802.30s]  Did you kill that thing?
[2802.86s -> 2803.26s]  I did.
[2803.98s -> 2804.78s]  Can you put your thing down?
[2807.29s -> 2808.57s]  My thing should be down.
[2808.57s -> 2810.81s]  Well, I wonder if I spawn in a weird place.
[2811.53s -> 2813.45s]  I'm going to separation, miss.
[2813.45s -> 2814.25s]  Did you join me?
[2814.25s -> 2815.37s]  Did you try and join me?
[2815.37s -> 2817.34s]  I just did.
[2817.34s -> 2819.14s]  I was separating.
[2819.14s -> 2820.10s]  I'm now alone.
[2820.66s -> 2821.94s]  I'm wandering.
[2821.94s -> 2825.93s]  I'm looking for you.
[2825.93s -> 2826.89s]  I have appeared.
[2829.22s -> 2834.46s]  Well, kind of.
[2834.46s -> 2842.98s]  OK, the quality of your Diablo weapon is what material you need.
[2842.98s -> 2845.54s]  And then all Diablo items can only be plus two.
[2845.54s -> 2848.98s]  OK, so you are you still?
[2848.98s -> 2851.14s]  I'm still in that catacomb.
[2851.14s -> 2852.97s]  I don't know if it put me in your game.
[2853.61s -> 2858.81s]  I don't see you on the mini map on the compass.
[2859.37s -> 2862.25s]  I never said you joined my world.
[2863.61s -> 2865.88s]  That's interesting.
[2866.52s -> 2870.33s]  Maybe I can't do it down here.
[2873.13s -> 2879.16s]  Maybe because the catacombs make you like you can't fast travel to and from them.
[2880.50s -> 2882.71s]  Says I'm going to know.
[2882.71s -> 2885.42s]  OK, let me go back to the bonfire.
[2885.42s -> 2887.10s]  Wait, no, it does say you were in my game.
[2887.10s -> 2889.08s]  OK, you joined.
[2889.08s -> 2893.21s]  Hey, that was weird.
[2893.21s -> 2893.61s]  There you are.
[2893.61s -> 2894.73s]  Yeah, it must just bugged up.
[2896.62s -> 2902.68s]  Yeah, McChickens for me were just like, oh, yeah, of course, I like my chickens.
[2902.68s -> 2903.48s]  I'm going to order a chicken.
[2903.48s -> 2905.38s]  Of course, I will.
[2905.38s -> 2909.99s]  A lot of other places that I've been to, it was not that consistent.
[2909.99s -> 2912.63s]  And I know it's just like a patty, right?
[2912.63s -> 2913.91s]  That's why it was consistent for me.
[2916.63s -> 2920.02s]  Have you gone to the McDonald's in Japan?
[2920.02s -> 2921.46s]  No, I heard it's good, though.
[2921.46s -> 2923.46s]  Well, you're saying they're consistent everywhere.
[2923.46s -> 2926.95s]  But have you been everywhere?
[2926.95s -> 2927.27s]  I did.
[2927.27s -> 2929.59s]  I've not been outside outside of North America.
[2930.23s -> 2938.82s]  Well, then is the McDonald's consistent outside of your limited small bubble worldview?
[2938.82s -> 2939.22s]  I guess.
[2939.22s -> 2945.80s]  I don't know.
[2945.80s -> 2946.44s]  Whoa.
[2946.44s -> 2948.84s]  OK, you were you were just fighting nothing on my screen.
[2948.84s -> 2950.44s]  And it just poured it in and I can't hurt it.
[2952.17s -> 2952.73s]  Can it hurt me?
[2960.01s -> 2960.57s]  I don't know.
[2961.61s -> 2963.05s]  I don't know what's happening.
[2963.61s -> 2964.41s]  I'm poisoned.
[2965.05s -> 2965.61s]  It hurts.
[2965.61s -> 2966.73s]  Oh, he's poisoned.
[2967.86s -> 2968.74s]  I'm going to die.
[2968.74s -> 2969.54s]  I'm running back.
[2969.54s -> 2970.50s]  I have a lot of souls.
[2971.22s -> 2975.16s]  All right.
[2975.16s -> 2977.40s]  What's your favorite chicken sandwich?
[2979.46s -> 2980.50s]  Oh, boy.
[2981.30s -> 2984.94s]  Yeah, I have infinite stamina, too.
[2985.75s -> 2987.27s]  Yeah, that's part of a reforged.
[2987.27s -> 2989.59s]  I'm going to die like right as I touch this.
[2989.59s -> 2990.23s]  Oh, lucky.
[2992.07s -> 2996.89s]  I don't like there was that big craze a while ago where every person in America was literally
[2996.89s -> 3000.25s]  murdering people for like the Popeye's chicken sandwich, right?
[3000.25s -> 3003.13s]  That's why I thought like you were going to have some like exclusive.
[3003.13s -> 3004.89s]  Like I killed a guy for the sandwich.
[3006.39s -> 3007.83s]  I don't like a lot of places.
[3007.83s -> 3009.75s]  But I don't really care that much.
[3010.71s -> 3012.71s]  It seemed like the kind of thing you would care about.
[3012.71s -> 3013.35s]  No.
[3013.35s -> 3016.63s]  Oh, I got to eat every chicken sandwich from every.
[3016.63s -> 3018.95s]  Why do you think I care that much about chicken sandwiches?
[3020.34s -> 3027.03s]  It like falls under the category of like fast food or cereal, which is like one of your biggest.
[3027.03s -> 3031.91s]  Dude, the last bowl of cereal I ate was honey bunches of oats with strawberry.
[3031.91s -> 3033.99s]  Back in fucking 2019.
[3033.99s -> 3039.18s]  You talk about cereal mascots so often that it just seems like.
[3039.18s -> 3040.38s]  Oh, I can't be a fan.
[3040.38s -> 3041.74s]  I can't be a fan of cereal.
[3041.74s -> 3043.18s]  I have to like eat every cereal.
[3043.18s -> 3044.14s]  I can't just like cereal.
[3044.14s -> 3045.50s]  I can't just like watching the cereal.
[3045.50s -> 3047.18s]  I can't like enjoy watching like the characters.
[3047.18s -> 3048.54s]  Do they do commercials?
[3048.54s -> 3050.15s]  Oh, I gotta go level up.
[3050.15s -> 3050.71s]  What?
[3050.71s -> 3051.99s]  I got distracted.
[3051.99s -> 3054.39s]  Hey, I was the one that was supposed to be dumb today.
[3054.39s -> 3055.67s]  I got 4k souls.
[3055.67s -> 3056.87s]  OK, we're just starting.
[3056.87s -> 3058.65s]  I got a level.
[3058.65s -> 3063.85s]  Yeah, like watching the cereal like mascots, you know, do their fucking vlogs that they do.
[3063.85s -> 3064.09s]  What?
[3064.65s -> 3067.29s]  You watch you watch the cereal mascots do their vlogs.
[3067.29s -> 3070.89s]  You're following them on Insta when they do like their makeup tutorials.
[3070.89s -> 3073.93s]  And Captain Crunch is like, oh, you want to look like a pirate?
[3073.93s -> 3079.14s]  Are you telling me that if Captain Crunch had a YouTube channel where he was like,
[3079.14s -> 3084.84s]  oh, hey, Crunchtastic Cruncheteers, me, Captain Crunch, you wouldn't watch every single one?
[3084.84s -> 3087.72s]  I don't even watch the Gorillaz YouTube channel.
[3087.72s -> 3089.00s]  And that's basically what that is.
[3091.53s -> 3092.17s]  No, no, no, no.
[3092.17s -> 3095.29s]  We're talking like Captain Crunch is doing what Chuck E. Cheese did.
[3095.29s -> 3096.57s]  He's like streaming Elden Ring.
[3098.34s -> 3099.14s]  You wouldn't watch that?
[3099.86s -> 3102.66s]  Captain Crunch is streaming Elden Ring.
[3102.66s -> 3104.02s]  I will take a look.
[3104.02s -> 3105.46s]  Yes, you of course you would.
[3106.68s -> 3109.24s]  I probably would not stay longer than like a minute.
[3109.96s -> 3111.00s]  I would have to look.
[3111.88s -> 3118.55s]  He's got a rare.
[3119.93s -> 3120.81s]  Oh, nice rare.
[3125.53s -> 3134.20s]  Poison plus three and yeah, we saw how streaming worked for the mascots.
[3134.20s -> 3135.40s]  Yeah, but here's the thing.
[3135.40s -> 3136.76s]  Chuck E. Cheese didn't talk.
[3138.17s -> 3141.13s]  The Chuck E. Cheese that streamed didn't talk at all.
[3141.69s -> 3143.86s]  Oh, watch out for this guy.
[3143.86s -> 3144.26s]  This guy.
[3146.66s -> 3150.66s]  Captain Crunch was screaming on Twitch and he was like, oh, my Captain Crunch cereal.
[3150.66s -> 3152.34s]  He said that before every single sentence.
[3152.34s -> 3153.78s]  People would fucking go crazy for it.
[3156.07s -> 3156.71s]  Get wrecked.
[3156.71s -> 3157.67s]  The Chappy Challenge.
[3167.59s -> 3168.31s]  It would suck.
[3168.31s -> 3168.87s]  No, it wouldn't.
[3168.87s -> 3169.35s]  It'd be fun.
[3170.63s -> 3171.19s]  For a minute.
[3176.63s -> 3177.35s]  Oh, this guy again.
[3181.13s -> 3182.57s]  I think that never mind.
[3183.29s -> 3190.47s]  He like leaves them like the camera on or something.
[3190.47s -> 3191.91s]  He like leaves like hot mic on.
[3193.91s -> 3195.19s]  Oh, that's kind of funny.
[3196.15s -> 3201.78s]  I had you all see when Captain Crunch hot mic'd.
[3205.99s -> 3206.39s]  You know what?
[3206.39s -> 3209.19s]  I'll see you in a moment for some more Kevin Crunch gameplay.
[3209.19s -> 3210.23s]  And it's like you hear shuffling.
[3210.23s -> 3213.16s]  You hear like fucking hate this fucking game.
[3214.30s -> 3217.02s]  I just fucking hell in the ring millennia.
[3217.02s -> 3219.51s]  I've just bought millennia.
[3219.51s -> 3220.87s]  Piece of fucking garbage.
[3223.18s -> 3225.34s]  I feel like we're not far off from a future.
[3225.34s -> 3229.82s]  Like it always takes the corporations like five years to catch on to trends.
[3229.82s -> 3235.82s]  Five years from now, Captain Crunch AI generated stream down here.
[3235.82s -> 3237.10s]  Jeremy, it's going to happen.
[3237.10s -> 3240.54s]  And I think we go in this secret tunnel door.
[3240.54s -> 3240.86s]  Okay.
[3241.74s -> 3242.54s]  Is it gone?
[3243.18s -> 3249.74s]  Okay.
[3255.21s -> 3261.40s]  Oh, oh, did you just got crunchetized?
[3264.34s -> 3264.74s]  I would know.
[3264.74s -> 3267.22s]  I would want Captain Crunch to play a street fighter or something.
[3267.22s -> 3267.54s]  Right.
[3267.54s -> 3271.54s]  Are you uncomfortable when the kids in the commercial are like crunchetize me, Captain?
[3271.54s -> 3272.82s]  And he's like an old man.
[3272.82s -> 3277.06s]  And like all these kids are super excited to like get on his boat alone with him.
[3277.06s -> 3278.74s]  Well, I always thought the tricks rabbit was weird.
[3279.70s -> 3282.10s]  Like, oh, silly rabbit tricks for kids.
[3282.10s -> 3283.86s]  And he's just like, oh, give me that box.
[3284.58s -> 3286.18s]  It's like what you can't just.
[3286.18s -> 3288.50s]  Why do you have to like, why can't you just buy one?
[3289.22s -> 3291.29s]  I don't know.
[3291.29s -> 3292.25s]  I got a dragon.
[3292.25s -> 3292.89s]  Hold on a minute.
[3292.89s -> 3293.29s]  They would wait.
[3293.29s -> 3294.01s]  They were taking it.
[3294.01s -> 3295.29s]  They were taking it from him.
[3295.29s -> 3296.25s]  I got it the wrong way around.
[3296.25s -> 3297.45s]  The kids are stealing it from him.
[3298.09s -> 3298.33s]  Yeah.
[3299.13s -> 3306.28s]  Why silly rabbit tricks are for kids.
[3306.28s -> 3308.12s]  Like he wasn't allowed to eat them.
[3308.92s -> 3309.16s]  Yeah.
[3310.10s -> 3311.78s]  And then the rabbit would starve.
[3313.70s -> 3314.74s]  I think there was a different one.
[3314.74s -> 3316.50s]  Like the the cookie crisps.
[3316.50s -> 3317.78s]  That was the wolf.
[3317.78s -> 3319.30s]  I think that was trying to steal.
[3320.79s -> 3321.35s]  Watch out.
[3322.15s -> 3322.63s]  Grandma.
[3325.37s -> 3326.09s]  Corner grandma.
[3326.73s -> 3329.21s]  When he said America is so stupid.
[3329.21s -> 3337.05s]  Come on now.
[3337.05s -> 3341.21s]  America is so stupid because what we have because we have Captain Crunch.
[3343.08s -> 3344.28s]  Captain Crunch is a legend.
[3351.85s -> 3355.69s]  Oh, it's the Elden Lord.
[3356.57s -> 3357.54s]  Who is it?
[3358.73s -> 3359.45s]  It's you.
[3359.45s -> 3359.93s]  Oh, it's.
[3360.73s -> 3361.37s]  Oh, we'll go.
[3362.09s -> 3362.97s]  Oh, my God.
[3362.97s -> 3363.53s]  What the heck?
[3367.93s -> 3368.41s]  Take this.
[3368.41s -> 3371.21s]  My Captain Crunch cereal will knock you out of your park.
[3372.84s -> 3373.32s]  Take that.
[3374.54s -> 3374.86s]  Sir.
[3376.22s -> 3377.42s]  Got to protect the captain here.
[3378.55s -> 3379.59s]  I could fucking do it.
[3381.27s -> 3392.57s]  Can you imagine Captain Crunch just becomes like a huge streamer.
[3394.10s -> 3396.26s]  The number one streamer is Captain Crunch.
[3397.06s -> 3398.62s]  I wouldn't even care.
[3401.32s -> 3402.76s]  I mean, do you care who it is now?
[3404.12s -> 3405.80s]  I mean, I don't even who is like.
[3406.98s -> 3408.82s]  I would care more if it was Captain Crunch.
[3410.22s -> 3411.58s]  That'd be kind of a wild.
[3411.58s -> 3414.30s]  Hey, VM.
[3421.29s -> 3424.01s]  All the cereal mascots have like huge channels.
[3424.89s -> 3430.71s]  That would be so fucked up.
[3432.25s -> 3436.50s]  Oh, OK.
[3436.50s -> 3437.78s]  We need to actually look at this stuff.
[3439.40s -> 3443.24s]  Ancestral star scourges, profit trousers of grit.
[3444.57s -> 3446.65s]  These names are definitely Diablo item names.
[3447.21s -> 3450.66s]  OK.
[3450.66s -> 3453.96s]  And there's a chest over here.
[3453.96s -> 3456.84s]  I don't think I can really even put these on.
[3459.46s -> 3463.74s]  This is strength scaling off of intelligence.
[3463.74s -> 3467.03s]  OK, strengthens death sorceries by 10 percent.
[3467.83s -> 3469.59s]  Poison moth flight.
[3469.59s -> 3480.25s]  OK, that's kind of cool.
[3480.25s -> 3489.18s]  Mind triggers every 2.8 seconds plus one HP every three seconds.
[3489.18s -> 3494.54s]  What the hecky dude strengthens gravity sorceries by 30 percent.
[3494.54s -> 3496.30s]  Yeah, they get they get kind of wacky, don't they?
[3496.30s -> 3500.65s]  An arc plus three on the same item.
[3500.65s -> 3501.61s]  They do.
[3501.61s -> 3504.25s]  They do for sure get kind of wacky with it.
[3504.33s -> 3506.01s]  OK, not that any.
[3506.01s -> 3508.92s]  Well, I guess some of the gravity spells are pretty strong.
[3508.92s -> 3509.96s]  I don't want to be fat rolling.
[3509.96s -> 3511.69s]  I can't wear this.
[3511.69s -> 3512.33s]  All right.
[3512.33s -> 3520.62s]  Why do we start a new run?
[3521.83s -> 3531.06s]  Because we have two new mods on and we're just trying to see how fun it is.
[3531.06s -> 3535.61s]  We have the Diablo to loot and then.
[3537.13s -> 3540.97s]  Elden ring reforged and randomizer and seamless co-op.
[3540.97s -> 3545.83s]  Fire damage dealt and I have fire.
[3545.83s -> 3547.43s]  I guess I'll use it, I guess.
[3547.43s -> 3560.94s]  Returning to entrance and you were trying to go faith magic.
[3560.94s -> 3563.69s]  I want to do faith arcane if we can.
[3563.69s -> 3576.95s]  If I can actually figure out how to turn on the warlock class subclass, whatever it is.
[3576.95s -> 3579.11s]  OK, I'm really not sure we're going to be able to do that.
[3579.11s -> 3580.74s]  Well, it's all right.
[3580.74s -> 3585.74s]  All right.
[3585.74s -> 3587.59s]  15 vigor.
[3587.59s -> 3590.18s]  That's better than 10.
[3590.18s -> 3595.26s]  Still fat rolling.
[3595.26s -> 3601.42s]  Oh, my God.
[3601.42s -> 3602.70s]  I don't know why I thought friendly fire was on.
[3606.30s -> 3609.98s]  That was an enjoyable adventure amongst traveling companions.
[3609.98s -> 3612.06s]  It was enjoyable.
[3612.06s -> 3616.58s]  But now we actually have stuff.
[3616.58s -> 3622.17s]  Read the lore on some of the items.
[3622.17s -> 3627.13s]  When every single misbegotten revealed every single misbegotten's greatest falsehood,
[3627.13s -> 3630.65s]  they wore this legendary restorative foot soldier cap of the Mad Tongue
[3630.65s -> 3633.94s]  to show their love for dominula.
[3633.94s -> 3634.66s]  All right.
[3634.66s -> 3636.26s]  Are they randomized?
[3636.26s -> 3637.64s]  I might be.
[3637.64s -> 3639.88s]  When Margit attacked the fire giants,
[3639.88s -> 3645.08s]  they wore this legendary knight's dialios mask, flaunting their allegiance to Hieta.
[3645.08s -> 3649.64s]  What about this uncommon club?
[3650.28s -> 3654.71s]  When a commander, when a commander stole a shard of destined death,
[3654.71s -> 3660.55s]  they swung this uncommon club so that the knight of the black knives would never reoccur.
[3660.55s -> 3660.87s]  Okay.
[3661.51s -> 3667.43s]  Yeah, they used this ancestral bolt charge club to win the hand of Merchant Kale.
[3672.10s -> 3677.70s]  When Zorias forged the Elden Ring, they struck their enemies with this
[3677.70s -> 3680.74s]  common duelist greataxe of the novice mage,
[3680.74s -> 3683.78s]  but it was not enough to save their trusted friend Margit.
[3684.34s -> 3689.86s]  Pretty good.
[3690.95s -> 3691.75s]  Oh, what the?
[3696.18s -> 3696.66s]  Not bad.
[3696.66s -> 3697.14s]  Pretty good.
[3698.36s -> 3698.84s]  All right.
[3698.84s -> 3699.16s]  Cool.
[3699.88s -> 3702.89s]  Say, where do you want to go?
[3710.14s -> 3711.58s]  Far away from that enemy.
[3711.58s -> 3715.58s]  Isn't there usually like an item back here that's relevant?
[3716.47s -> 3717.59s]  We can go do Margit.
[3718.23s -> 3718.95s]  That was kind of your thing.
[3718.95s -> 3719.67s]  We did my thing.
[3719.67s -> 3720.47s]  We can do your thing.
[3720.47s -> 3722.55s]  We can do trade-offs, you know?
[3723.35s -> 3724.25s]  That sounds fun.
[3725.29s -> 3727.85s]  I want to get some spells.
[3728.89s -> 3730.25s]  The lance talisman.
[3734.22s -> 3735.98s]  That was a lance talisman for me too.
[3735.98s -> 3736.54s]  What does that do?
[3743.34s -> 3745.43s]  Okay.
[3747.66s -> 3750.46s]  To Margit, who is going to be like millennia.
[3754.79s -> 3755.75s]  That would be very sad.
[3756.39s -> 3766.44s]  Go to the foot of the urn tree and become Elden Lord now.
[3767.16s -> 3772.04s]  I mean, is there anything else to do?
[3772.60s -> 3784.34s]  I thought that was Kenneth height.
[3785.74s -> 3788.14s]  That's a pot boy on the hill.
[3788.86s -> 3789.74s]  Anyone else there?
[3790.46s -> 3797.70s]  I'm kind of leading you in a direction that is the opposite direction of Margit.
[3797.78s -> 3799.46s]  I know that I'm doing that.
[3799.46s -> 3801.14s]  No, I'm aware, but we don't have to.
[3801.14s -> 3802.18s]  We can just do whatever.
[3802.74s -> 3804.10s]  I was kidding when I said we had to do Margit.
[3804.10s -> 3804.34s]  Jump.
[3806.86s -> 3807.50s]  My goodness.
[3807.50s -> 3808.14s]  I didn't make it.
[3809.96s -> 3810.60s]  And we go this way.
[3810.60s -> 3811.24s]  There's another cave.
[3811.24s -> 3812.36s]  You want to do another cave?
[3812.36s -> 3812.60s]  Yeah.
[3816.06s -> 3819.50s]  This is my ancestral great club charged with bolts.
[3820.06s -> 3823.18s]  And it's going to make merchant Kayle want to marry me.
[3823.98s -> 3826.89s]  Where the heck are you going?
[3827.77s -> 3828.97s]  I think you got to go up this.
[3839.16s -> 3839.80s]  Right?
[3839.80s -> 3841.16s]  I know there's one here.
[3841.16s -> 3842.76s]  It's probably down here.
[3842.76s -> 3851.08s]  Turtle meat.
[3854.26s -> 3854.74s]  Right here.
[3856.54s -> 3857.66s]  Oh, shoot.
[3857.66s -> 3861.48s]  We don't got any torches looking like a dark one.
[3863.37s -> 3866.42s]  I wrote a cave and it could be darker.
[3867.06s -> 3871.46s]  I heard you love that game.
[3872.26s -> 3873.86s]  I love dark and darker.
[3873.86s -> 3874.66s]  Oh, man.
[3874.66s -> 3876.02s]  I've been addicted, man.
[3876.02s -> 3878.42s]  Like, I really just love when I get the item.
[3878.42s -> 3879.38s]  I think you're just a hater.
[3880.26s -> 3880.82s]  I know.
[3880.82s -> 3881.22s]  I know.
[3882.66s -> 3883.54s]  That's what they all think.
[3884.18s -> 3885.85s]  That's what they're all thinking.
[3886.57s -> 3894.63s]  You feel any more new or two?
[3896.36s -> 3898.12s]  Yeah, I got to like near the end of it.
[3898.12s -> 3900.76s]  They're still getting the game is very long.
[3900.76s -> 3901.56s]  Are you enjoying it?
[3902.52s -> 3902.84s]  What?
[3906.18s -> 3907.62s]  He grabbed me from such a weird angle.
[3912.55s -> 3913.27s]  Yeah, I was liking it.
[3913.27s -> 3915.75s]  I was just getting a little exhausted.
[3916.47s -> 3917.35s]  I played a lot.
[3917.35s -> 3918.63s]  I had like 60 hours in it.
[3918.63s -> 3921.83s]  I was like, I'm doing pretty good on that.
[3923.29s -> 3925.53s]  I'm still pressing some Neo buttons while we're playing, but.
[3926.17s -> 3926.65s]  It happens.
[3927.37s -> 3928.49s]  I don't know what happens.
[3929.05s -> 3932.57s]  Hey, you want to go down and there's a giant vacuous tunnel.
[3934.12s -> 3935.64s]  Only if we go together.
[3937.30s -> 3938.66s]  Just you, me.
[3938.66s -> 3939.30s]  Grab my hand.
[3939.86s -> 3947.05s]  Captain Crunch, the Cocoa Puffs bird, Tony the Tiger, all of us in our party.
[3951.90s -> 3955.42s]  You would collab with, I mean, that's a ton of eyeballs.
[3957.72s -> 3958.68s]  A ton of eyeballs.
[3958.68s -> 3960.92s]  All the Tony the Tiger fans tuning in.
[3960.92s -> 3962.68s]  How many boxes of Frosted Flakes have you ever eaten?
[3963.48s -> 3965.40s]  These are way more famous than anybody on here.
[3967.46s -> 3969.54s]  How much money would you value?
[3970.79s -> 3972.79s]  You, specifically you getting.
[3974.79s -> 3976.71s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[3976.71s -> 3978.63s]  There was an explosion person here.
[3979.51s -> 3981.03s]  I just kind of watched.
[3981.03s -> 3982.23s]  So you want to spectate or?
[3982.87s -> 3983.83s]  I mean, I guess you have to.
[3983.83s -> 3985.19s]  I can't touch the bonfire.
[3987.11s -> 3988.47s]  You got to hold the L.
[3988.47s -> 3991.35s]  I mean, I respond, but.
[3991.35s -> 3992.23s]  Oh, did you?
[3992.23s -> 3995.83s]  Yeah, it's very dark down.
[3995.83s -> 3996.47s]  I can't see.
[3996.47s -> 3997.91s]  It's so dark and darker.
[3997.91s -> 3999.91s]  It's like someone's been turning all the lights off.
[3999.91s -> 4002.92s]  I'm just going to come down there.
[4004.41s -> 4005.99s]  Help, help.
[4005.99s -> 4007.11s]  I'm going back.
[4007.11s -> 4007.67s]  I'm scared.
[4010.31s -> 4012.63s]  How much would you value Frosted Flakes for life?
[4012.63s -> 4014.33s]  Like monetary value?
[4014.33s -> 4014.65s]  OK.
[4015.29s -> 4019.05s]  You're like I can pay right now to unlock all of the gods and smite,
[4019.05s -> 4022.76s]  but it's actually Frosted Flakes for life.
[4022.76s -> 4023.88s]  I don't really.
[4023.88s -> 4025.02s]  I mean, I don't.
[4025.02s -> 4028.86s]  When you open your cabinet, there will be a fresh box of Frosted Flakes there.
[4028.86s -> 4029.58s]  Whenever you want.
[4029.58s -> 4032.22s]  Did you go down the second fall?
[4032.22s -> 4035.99s]  Like in the hole?
[4035.99s -> 4036.87s]  I don't know where you are.
[4036.87s -> 4039.29s]  Did you go down the second drop down?
[4039.29s -> 4040.73s]  I'm where you died.
[4040.73s -> 4042.25s]  There's multiple drop downs.
[4042.25s -> 4043.45s]  I destroyed the fire.
[4043.45s -> 4045.53s]  I'm there's a single candle.
[4045.53s -> 4049.90s]  I died right here.
[4049.90s -> 4050.30s]  Here.
[4050.30s -> 4051.26s]  Here we are.
[4051.26s -> 4051.58s]  All right.
[4051.58s -> 4052.14s]  OK.
[4052.14s -> 4056.76s]  Now to the left, you can clearly see that there's a tunnel.
[4056.76s -> 4057.32s]  Yeah.
[4057.32s -> 4062.02s]  But what you're saying, what's the monetary value for that be worth it to me?
[4062.58s -> 4063.14s]  Yeah.
[4063.14s -> 4067.27s]  When I open this cabinet, it's filled with it every time.
[4067.27s -> 4073.03s]  Humble bundle, choose your own price, but be fair of what the value is.
[4073.03s -> 4074.79s]  Well, then I don't care.
[4074.79s -> 4078.15s]  Like so I open up my cabinet and it's like I get to decide
[4078.15s -> 4080.95s]  what I pay for a box of Frosted Flakes today.
[4080.95s -> 4081.51s]  Is that what you're saying?
[4081.51s -> 4082.23s]  No, no, no.
[4082.23s -> 4083.67s]  You pay up front.
[4083.67s -> 4083.91s]  OK.
[4083.91s -> 4086.47s]  You pay like a hundred dollars now if you think that's fair.
[4086.47s -> 4088.55s]  And then you get Frosted Flakes for life.
[4089.11s -> 4089.59s]  OK.
[4089.59s -> 4091.35s]  But can I give this to other people?
[4092.07s -> 4092.63s]  No.
[4092.63s -> 4095.19s]  This is why I said specifically for you.
[4095.19s -> 4096.71s]  So I can't like open up this cabinet.
[4096.71s -> 4099.91s]  Scarlet rotting us in a cave where we can't see.
[4099.91s -> 4101.43s]  Well, you wanted to come down here.
[4102.71s -> 4103.51s]  No, forget.
[4103.51s -> 4105.03s]  Don't forget who wanted to come down here.
[4105.91s -> 4109.37s]  I'm just saying we're having this conversation while we're dodging them
[4109.37s -> 4112.09s]  and not actually fighting them or trying to leave.
[4112.09s -> 4112.97s]  OK, so here we go.
[4114.01s -> 4117.85s]  If I could give it to people, I would just keep opening the cabinet
[4117.85s -> 4121.29s]  and just putting boxes and boxes into like a storage facility
[4121.29s -> 4122.81s]  and then people can just take it.
[4122.81s -> 4126.25s]  Like it would be like a never ending supply of food, right?
[4126.25s -> 4127.21s]  You cannot do that.
[4127.21s -> 4127.53s]  Stop.
[4127.53s -> 4128.09s]  You're cheating.
[4129.13s -> 4131.10s]  OK.
[4131.10s -> 4134.84s]  Well, then so well, then who cares about I don't like,
[4135.48s -> 4137.00s]  I can just go get it to the grocery store.
[4142.33s -> 4144.82s]  Oh, three HP a second.
[4145.46s -> 4147.19s]  I put it on.
[4147.83s -> 4149.30s]  Holy shit.
[4149.30s -> 4150.10s]  This thing's cool looking.
[4152.78s -> 4155.10s]  I had some HP per second pants or something.
[4155.82s -> 4163.19s]  I also have some pants that regenerate F.P.
[4164.84s -> 4165.24s]  F.P.
[4166.46s -> 4167.42s]  Oh, the pants.
[4167.42s -> 4168.14s]  I have a pretty good.
[4168.94s -> 4171.42s]  It's got bleed.
[4171.42s -> 4172.54s]  I don't think I can really use it.
[4172.54s -> 4173.42s]  I need more strength.
[4173.98s -> 4175.82s]  OK, make sure you don't die.
[4178.14s -> 4178.62s]  Noob.
[4178.62s -> 4183.10s]  What's the most you would consider paying for one normal size box of frosted flakes?
[4184.42s -> 4188.50s]  Yeah, and then multiply that times your life expectancy of like three weeks.
[4189.54s -> 4195.66s]  I don't I I don't eat that much cereal.
[4195.66s -> 4197.58s]  Dude, I'm getting so many items.
[4197.58s -> 4200.38s]  I know I'm getting like an overwhelming amount of things to look at.
[4200.38s -> 4202.46s]  Oh, but there's a big boy.
[4210.82s -> 4216.71s]  I also I swear one of us killed themselves and put it on easy mode.
[4217.83s -> 4219.03s]  I don't think that happened.
[4219.59s -> 4221.19s]  I do think that happened.
[4221.19s -> 4224.79s]  Well, it had to have been you because you're the one that coached me through pressing the buttons.
[4225.51s -> 4229.43s]  Oh, this thing is a taunt.
[4229.43s -> 4234.31s]  I don't want this either that or like we are getting like mythic God weapon
[4234.31s -> 4235.99s]  and they're just dealing a shit ton of damage.
[4236.55s -> 4238.23s]  I think that's probably more accurate.
[4242.30s -> 4243.34s]  Where do you drop here?
[4243.34s -> 4244.38s]  You just drop right here.
[4246.65s -> 4248.25s]  I believe you.
[4248.25s -> 4248.49s]  Yes.
[4251.51s -> 4252.55s]  Oh, can you make this jump?
[4253.43s -> 4253.91s]  I hope so.
[4260.58s -> 4260.90s]  Nope.
[4260.90s -> 4263.22s]  Oh, damn it.
[4263.22s -> 4264.26s]  Fucking God damn it.
[4264.26s -> 4266.82s]  This game is absolutely fucking broken.
[4267.46s -> 4269.30s]  How could anybody want to play a game like this?
[4269.30s -> 4269.62s]  Stir.
[4269.62s -> 4272.52s]  It's really great collabing with you.
[4272.52s -> 4275.72s]  Make sure to check out my Kevin Crunch new all Crunch Berry cereal.
[4276.44s -> 4277.16s]  God damn it.
[4281.53s -> 4285.85s]  Ah, I couldn't make the jump.
[4285.85s -> 4286.49s]  I wait.
[4286.49s -> 4287.05s]  I'm up here.
[4287.77s -> 4290.62s]  I'll make it.
[4294.36s -> 4295.08s]  No, this is fine.
[4295.08s -> 4297.72s]  I thought I was going to get knocked down like away from everything.
[4304.06s -> 4305.18s]  Good save.
[4305.18s -> 4305.50s]  Thanks.
[4306.22s -> 4306.94s]  Yeah, good save.
[4307.58s -> 4311.66s]  What was that?
[4312.30s -> 4313.72s]  Stop doing that.
[4315.83s -> 4316.87s]  He's going to keep doing that.
[4317.51s -> 4321.66s]  Okay.
[4325.70s -> 4326.98s]  You don't like frosted flakes.
[4328.58s -> 4329.22s]  But too long.
[4329.22s -> 4329.70s]  Didn't read.
[4330.74s -> 4332.34s]  I don't eat that much cereal.
[4332.34s -> 4333.46s]  You're okay.
[4333.46s -> 4334.02s]  What do you eat?
[4335.70s -> 4337.14s]  If you don't eat cereal, what?
[4337.14s -> 4338.42s]  Oh, what that?
[4338.98s -> 4339.77s]  I don't know.
[4343.98s -> 4346.22s]  Oh, I thought I thought that was one of those things
[4346.22s -> 4347.98s]  that like shoot you from the ceiling.
[4347.98s -> 4349.42s]  Oh, no, it's an albinoeric.
[4354.98s -> 4356.98s]  There's supposed to be something going on in here.
[4357.54s -> 4361.30s]  There's usually a giganto octa in here.
[4364.33s -> 4365.85s]  Oh, nice teamwork.
[4368.60s -> 4368.92s]  Nice.
[4369.64s -> 4374.78s]  I can't believe you wanted to come in here
[4374.78s -> 4375.90s]  without even getting the lantern.
[4377.22s -> 4379.30s]  Well, how hard would it be to talk to you
[4379.30s -> 4380.82s]  to tell you that I want to go by the lantern
[4380.82s -> 4383.14s]  from the specific lantern spot before you got distracted?
[4383.86s -> 4387.56s]  Two minutes.
[4387.56s -> 4393.05s]  Are we going to drop here?
[4393.85s -> 4397.16s]  Look if this is the right.
[4397.16s -> 4398.44s]  Yes, this is the right way.
[4400.31s -> 4402.63s]  Oh, this is the right way.
[4405.69s -> 4406.57s]  To top yourself off.
[4407.37s -> 4408.17s]  Don't be an idiot.
[4408.89s -> 4411.90s]  You can mean top myself off.
[4412.46s -> 4412.78s]  Heals.
[4413.58s -> 4414.79s]  Don't be an idiot.
[4414.79s -> 4415.67s]  I'm full HP.
[4417.03s -> 4417.27s]  Okay.
[4417.27s -> 4417.67s]  You ready?
[4420.10s -> 4421.30s]  Are we both using club?
[4422.20s -> 4423.88s]  Yeah, because the only thing we can both use.
[4425.62s -> 4426.90s]  Okay.
[4426.90s -> 4427.78s]  We need stats.
[4430.07s -> 4432.31s]  Guardian Gary Garris.
[4432.31s -> 4433.59s]  Oh, no, it's Gary.
[4435.03s -> 4436.07s]  Of course, Gary.
[4436.07s -> 4436.71s]  Who could forget?
[4438.58s -> 4441.14s]  Wait, it's Gary and a bunch of other.
[4441.14s -> 4441.70s]  What?
[4441.70s -> 4442.98s]  I don't know what these are.
[4442.98s -> 4444.26s]  It's motorbike snails.
[4447.06s -> 4447.46s]  Gary.
[4448.34s -> 4450.23s]  All right.
[4450.23s -> 4451.43s]  These things are actually kind of dangerous.
[4454.30s -> 4456.46s]  This is definitely uneasy for me.
[4457.50s -> 4458.70s]  What do you mean uneasy?
[4459.74s -> 4463.90s]  Reborn has like a difficulty setting and I must have picked one.
[4464.86s -> 4465.58s]  I don't know.
[4466.70s -> 4468.98s]  What is that?
[4476.60s -> 4477.88s]  Oh, fuck off, Gary.
[4483.58s -> 4485.42s]  Oh, don't call me Guardian Garris.
[4485.42s -> 4486.94s]  My friends call me Gary.
[4487.74s -> 4490.86s]  Okay.
[4491.66s -> 4495.00s]  I got a bunch of shit.
[4499.29s -> 4499.61s]  Okay.
[4499.61s -> 4500.97s]  This is more sorceries.
[4504.17s -> 4505.03s]  Okay.
[4505.03s -> 4505.83s]  What about this shit?
[4507.26s -> 4509.02s]  Golden order incantations.
[4509.02s -> 4510.78s]  Stamina regen by 8%.
[4510.78s -> 4515.10s]  That's actually kind of good, but no.
[4519.54s -> 4520.90s]  I've got the planets.
[4529.03s -> 4530.23s]  I love that weapon.
[4530.23s -> 4533.35s]  Do you want this baby rattle that is also the moon veil?
[4534.55s -> 4536.63s]  Or no, this is just a regular katana attack.
[4539.06s -> 4540.50s]  I use that in my regular playthrough.
[4542.84s -> 4543.32s]  Pretty fun.
[4544.50s -> 4546.42s]  I don't think I wanted to act like a katana, though.
[4546.42s -> 4548.18s]  That seems really kind of bad.
[4548.98s -> 4549.46s]  Okay.
[4549.46s -> 4550.18s]  Well, you're bad.
[4550.18s -> 4551.38s]  We got to go to a bonfire.
[4551.62s -> 4553.06s]  Make sure it's not on easy mode.
[4553.78s -> 4561.62s]  I'm starting to understand it.
[4562.18s -> 4564.31s]  I get it.
[4566.90s -> 4569.46s]  We just need stats first so we can actually put some of this stuff on.
[4570.10s -> 4573.62s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4573.62s -> 4575.85s]  This is physical damage.
[4576.41s -> 4579.66s]  Physical damage.
[4579.66s -> 4580.54s]  We got to teleport.
[4581.34s -> 4581.98s]  Has to happen.
[4584.47s -> 4585.59s]  Okay, hold on.
[4585.59s -> 4589.30s]  All right, let's go.
[4589.30s -> 4592.98s]  I posted pictures of the mod's menu trees in the Discord.
[4592.98s -> 4594.18s]  What?
[4594.18s -> 4594.66s]  A hero?
[4595.86s -> 4600.07s]  A hero is the right word.
[4600.07s -> 4604.95s]  Oh, they're fully labeled with red lines on what they lead to.
[4604.95s -> 4605.27s]  Really?
[4606.28s -> 4606.92s]  Jesus.
[4606.92s -> 4608.04s]  Wow, that's actually amazing.
[4613.77s -> 4614.81s]  This has the stomp.
[4617.88s -> 4618.92s]  Isn't this thing insane?
[4619.64s -> 4621.16s]  Sir, this thing's broken, right?
[4623.53s -> 4625.53s]  They nerfed it a lot, but it is very strong.
[4625.53s -> 4628.28s]  Okay, I'll take it.
[4631.82s -> 4633.10s]  Oh, hold up.
[4634.17s -> 4635.85s]  That's why I was confused earlier.
[4636.65s -> 4636.89s]  Yeah.
[4640.23s -> 4647.05s]  We don't have a fortunes menu that we're supposed to have.
[4647.94s -> 4650.42s]  I don't know what enables that to exist.
[4650.42s -> 4652.10s]  I thought you had it from the beginning in Reforge,
[4652.10s -> 4655.06s]  but underneath flasks it's supposed to be fortunes and we don't have it.
[4655.62s -> 4655.86s]  Okay.
[4657.34s -> 4658.46s]  And I don't know why not.
[4658.46s -> 4660.14s]  I think we need an item, somebody said.
[4667.34s -> 4670.06s]  You need an item and you buy it from Kayle.
[4672.63s -> 4674.15s]  Okay, let's go warp to Kayle.
[4674.15s -> 4674.39s]  Okay.
[4680.87s -> 4683.11s]  Oracle's Effigy is what we need.
[4683.83s -> 4688.79s]  Trying to go there.
[4688.79s -> 4689.91s]  It's doing that thing.
[4689.91s -> 4691.27s]  I can't go.
[4691.27s -> 4692.07s]  We'll have to try it again.
[4692.95s -> 4700.55s]  Wait, is it earlier than Kayle?
[4700.55s -> 4704.55s]  An item you pick up at the first bonfire after you go up the elevator.
[4704.55s -> 4706.31s]  Yeah, we just ran right past that.
[4706.31s -> 4709.19s]  Oh, so like the graveyard or like the first step?
[4709.67s -> 4710.39s]  The first step.
[4711.11s -> 4720.01s]  Okay.
[4720.01s -> 4726.41s]  Oh, oh, I don't know.
[4726.41s -> 4727.85s]  I thought there was an item down there usually.
[4730.73s -> 4731.78s]  I'm starting to understand it.
[4731.78s -> 4732.34s]  I'm starting to get it.
[4733.70s -> 4738.58s]  It was a lot of overwhelming items and stuff and I think I'm getting it.
[4738.58s -> 4743.77s]  It's supposed to be that first stake.
[4743.77s -> 4747.69s]  We might have gotten it somewhere else then.
[4747.69s -> 4748.57s]  Okay.
[4748.57s -> 4753.66s]  I think somebody tried to give me directions very early on saying.
[4753.66s -> 4754.78s]  Is there an item there for you?
[4756.14s -> 4760.95s]  There was, but I think it was just the pick it up just absentmindedly.
[4763.91s -> 4767.83s]  I know that the item that is usually there we picked up like in that dungeon
[4767.83s -> 4770.07s]  because it's usually like a furled finger or something.
[4770.79s -> 4774.36s]  I don't see anything new.
[4774.92s -> 4777.99s]  You buy it from Kayle on the patch you're currently on.
[4777.99s -> 4779.75s]  It's there on the newer patches.
[4779.75s -> 4780.31s]  Okay.
[4780.31s -> 4780.71s]  Okay.
[4780.71s -> 4780.87s]  Yeah.
[4780.87s -> 4785.53s]  We're on an old patch so that it works with Diablo items.
[4785.53s -> 4786.17s]  Okay.
[4786.17s -> 4788.30s]  So now let's just get over there then.
[4797.58s -> 4799.82s]  My mom brought me fish sticks and garlic bread.
[4799.82s -> 4800.62s]  This rules.
[4800.62s -> 4801.74s]  That sounds pretty good actually.
[4803.48s -> 4806.12s]  He's not selling anything particularly interesting.
[4806.68s -> 4806.92s]  No.
[4814.26s -> 4819.13s]  No, not really.
[4819.13s -> 4819.29s]  Yeah.
[4819.29s -> 4822.81s]  We had to do a bunch of goofy shit to get these to even run together.
[4822.81s -> 4824.25s]  So maybe we just can't do it.
[4826.42s -> 4827.22s]  It's all right.
[4827.22s -> 4830.68s]  You buy a torch though.
[4831.24s -> 4837.70s]  I do want to level up.
[4846.17s -> 4847.77s]  Hmm.
[4847.77s -> 4854.58s]  I want to do faith and arcane but I'm kind of scared that my endurance is literally eight.
[4855.30s -> 4856.58s]  So I'm going to fix that.
[4857.22s -> 4883.13s]  Okay.
[4883.13s -> 4884.89s]  Follow sit down for a second.
[4884.89s -> 4892.09s]  Reforge is not really compatible with randomizer plus DSL just with okay.
[4893.88s -> 4894.28s]  Okay.
[4894.28s -> 4896.68s]  Do event text for talk the top one.
[4896.68s -> 4896.92s]  Okay.
[4898.55s -> 4901.21s]  Then do the top one.
[4901.21s -> 4901.53s]  Okay.
[4904.02s -> 4908.84s]  Then three down.
[4909.90s -> 4911.90s]  So you mean like one, two, three.
[4911.90s -> 4912.54s]  Fourth one.
[4912.54s -> 4912.86s]  Yeah.
[4912.86s -> 4913.98s]  The fourth one, three down.
[4913.98s -> 4914.38s]  Okay.
[4914.38s -> 4914.86s]  Say yes.
[4915.42s -> 4916.14s]  Then say yes.
[4916.78s -> 4917.66s]  What the fuck?
[4917.66s -> 4917.90s]  Ow.
[4920.15s -> 4920.71s]  What did you do?
[4921.83s -> 4924.63s]  That you have to die but that's to change the difficulty.
[4924.63s -> 4927.83s]  The difficulty changing kills you so you don't like carry over souls
[4927.83s -> 4932.55s]  or I don't know what their rules are but that made sure that we're both like on actual.
[4932.55s -> 4933.83s]  There's a normal difficulty.
[4933.83s -> 4935.35s]  We're on adept mode.
[4935.35s -> 4935.77s]  Okay.
[4935.77s -> 4936.97s]  We're co-oping like why not?
[4936.97s -> 4939.77s]  Oh, don't look at Ronnie when you respawn.
[4939.77s -> 4941.29s]  Are you actually being serious?
[4941.29s -> 4948.62s]  You're not being serious, right?
[4949.10s -> 4950.14s]  No, I'm not being serious.
[4954.14s -> 4955.58s]  You're such a joker.
[4959.29s -> 4960.89s]  One too many mods.
[4960.89s -> 4964.58s]  I forgot I left that one in for my personal archives.
[4966.02s -> 4966.98s]  Will you shut the fuck up?
[4967.54s -> 4970.36s]  Okay.
[4970.36s -> 4974.46s]  Bell's over there.
[4975.02s -> 4979.02s]  Ring my bell.
[4980.15s -> 4982.26s]  So I got this new item.
[4982.26s -> 4983.62s]  Things got that frost stomp.
[4983.62s -> 4985.78s]  I think we'd be able to stomp through the castle.
[4986.42s -> 4988.89s]  It goes a little bit like a wha-bam.
[4988.89s -> 4990.17s]  It goes a little bit like a wha-bam.
[4990.17s -> 4991.53s]  It goes a little bit like a wha-bam.
[4992.98s -> 4993.54s]  Damn.
[4993.54s -> 4995.30s]  You look like a bro.
[4995.30s -> 4995.62s]  Thanks.
[4996.44s -> 4999.16s]  You were scaling intelligence and arcane, you said?
[4999.16s -> 5001.88s]  I'm doing arcane and faith.
[5001.88s -> 5006.74s]  I want to do frenzied fire with three fingers.
[5006.74s -> 5010.68s]  So if I had like a faith arcane weapon.
[5011.86s -> 5022.57s]  I would probably use it if you had it.
[5022.57s -> 5022.89s]  Okay.
[5023.93s -> 5025.61s]  He would probably use it.
[5028.92s -> 5031.88s]  How about we go kill Margo?
[5032.44s -> 5035.43s]  I think we could at this stage.
[5035.43s -> 5043.80s]  What did that do?
[5044.36s -> 5045.51s]  It's a bow.
[5046.07s -> 5046.31s]  Okay.
[5049.06s -> 5052.02s]  I have a strengthens night sorceries by 30%.
[5053.38s -> 5054.42s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[5054.42s -> 5055.30s]  I just got a lot of...
[5056.02s -> 5057.46s]  I didn't look at one or two things
[5057.46s -> 5060.02s]  because they're throwing a million items at us.
[5066.76s -> 5067.08s]  Okay.
[5068.17s -> 5068.89s]  All right.
[5068.89s -> 5070.81s]  Let me buy some arrows.
[5070.81s -> 5071.85s]  I'm going to keep the strength one on.
[5075.26s -> 5075.90s]  I'm poor.
[5075.90s -> 5076.38s]  Never mind.
[5076.38s -> 5077.34s]  I bought one arrow.
[5078.38s -> 5079.02s]  Okay.
[5079.02s -> 5081.02s]  Let's teleport to storm hill shack.
[5081.66s -> 5082.30s]  Yeah.
[5082.30s -> 5084.26s]  And let's go fight Margaret.
[5084.98s -> 5085.46s]  Why not?
[5092.66s -> 5093.06s]  Yeah.
[5093.06s -> 5093.70s]  Why not?
[5093.70s -> 5095.46s]  I can't wait to open up Margaret
[5095.46s -> 5096.50s]  and it's going to be Shrek.
[5098.04s -> 5100.60s]  Is our warp like not working again?
[5101.16s -> 5101.88s]  It does it sometimes.
[5102.68s -> 5103.16s]  Do it again.
[5103.80s -> 5109.99s]  Hey, how about we go down here to this cave?
[5110.55s -> 5112.07s]  We could do that too.
[5112.63s -> 5113.45s]  Hey, follow me.
[5114.89s -> 5117.13s]  The universe was telling me through its bizarre powers.
[5117.13s -> 5119.05s]  You need the dingleberry drinker mod
[5119.05s -> 5119.85s]  if you want to drink.
[5119.85s -> 5120.09s]  Yeah.
[5120.65s -> 5124.90s]  I'm sad the classes thing is so goofed.
[5131.14s -> 5131.38s]  Yeah.
[5131.38s -> 5134.18s]  The new gimmick for this stream here.
[5134.74s -> 5137.54s]  We have the Diablo 2 Ludon, a new randomizer seed,
[5137.54s -> 5140.18s]  and then Elden Ring reforged,
[5140.18s -> 5142.90s]  which we probably can't use some of the stuff with it,
[5142.90s -> 5145.22s]  but we're just trying to we're just checking it out, you know?
[5145.94s -> 5146.58s]  Yeah.
[5146.58s -> 5147.86s]  It's pretty big overhaul.
[5147.86s -> 5148.50s]  We're checking it out.
[5148.50s -> 5149.06s]  Mechanics.
[5149.78s -> 5159.82s]  We're just seeing what happens.
[5163.56s -> 5165.64s]  I mean, anything could happen at any moment.
[5171.18s -> 5171.98s]  Even right now.
[5173.06s -> 5175.46s]  Something could be happening that we don't know about.
[5178.23s -> 5180.07s]  Well, I this weapon is probably way better.
[5180.71s -> 5182.98s]  I'm going to be doing that frost stomp.
[5182.98s -> 5184.02s]  It's going to be so insane.
[5185.16s -> 5186.20s]  You don't even have any idea.
[5187.51s -> 5189.27s]  Frenzy flame doesn't scale with arcane.
[5190.39s -> 5191.83s]  The oh, wait.
[5191.83s -> 5194.55s]  OK, so the warlock class that I can't choose
[5195.58s -> 5198.70s]  scales frenzied flame with it changes things.
[5198.70s -> 5199.66s]  So but I can't do that.
[5199.66s -> 5201.18s]  So all right, I need to figure out what to do.
[5202.12s -> 5204.14s]  Um, shit.
[5204.14s -> 5204.78s]  Hold on.
[5204.78s -> 5209.18s]  I don't want you can't drop it from the equipment on you, right?
[5209.98s -> 5211.34s]  I think it has to be in your inventory.
[5215.74s -> 5216.46s]  It's just faith.
[5216.46s -> 5217.34s]  OK, cool.
[5217.34s -> 5223.54s]  It's still decent.
[5225.26s -> 5227.58s]  Well, it lights up the hallway, so that's helpful.
[5228.46s -> 5229.66s]  I'm curious if this is good for you.
[5229.66s -> 5230.54s]  I dropped a weapon here.
[5231.26s -> 5239.48s]  Ancestral tempered lightning likes war spear.
[5239.48s -> 5249.91s]  OK, three in three arcane stamina minus 18 percent.
[5251.38s -> 5254.42s]  I need I don't have the stats for it, but I'll definitely keep it on.
[5255.06s -> 5257.21s]  OK, cool.
[5257.77s -> 5262.02s]  Oh, yeah, I'll use it eventually.
[5265.69s -> 5267.13s]  All right, let's let's explore this cave.
[5267.85s -> 5269.37s]  Oh, I have another faith one.
[5269.37s -> 5271.69s]  Actually, this one might also be cool.
[5271.69s -> 5272.41s]  I'm just going to drop it.
[5272.41s -> 5273.13s]  You can look at it later.
[5274.06s -> 5275.42s]  It just I know I didn't drop it.
[5275.42s -> 5275.98s]  Never mind.
[5275.98s -> 5277.42s]  Let's just let's just go.
[5277.42s -> 5278.78s]  Let's just let's just let's just game.
[5280.06s -> 5283.10s]  Game on.
[5283.82s -> 5285.26s]  Oh, I have F.P. Regen.
[5289.24s -> 5291.56s]  I mean, this is like kind of all right, I think.
[5293.32s -> 5295.56s]  I mean, you killed shit that was not on the screen.
[5295.56s -> 5299.46s]  I can't I'll be torch guy.
[5303.99s -> 5307.03s]  It's not really helping, but it's kind of doing stuff.
[5307.03s -> 5308.15s]  It's like staggering people.
[5309.03s -> 5314.94s]  It's OK.
[5315.66s -> 5316.16s]  It's not bad.
[5316.86s -> 5322.82s]  This is the ancient ancestral dragon's torch of light seeing.
[5323.30s -> 5325.37s]  Is that what it actually is called?
[5325.37s -> 5326.49s]  No, I made that one up.
[5327.86s -> 5329.38s]  Demi human chief soldier.
[5330.02s -> 5331.34s]  Watch out.
[5337.98s -> 5339.50s]  Are you sure it's not you put it on easy?
[5344.18s -> 5349.22s]  OK, rare, rare lightning night rider flail of shadow walking.
[5350.58s -> 5352.42s]  Treasured talisman of restoration,
[5352.42s -> 5354.74s]  treasured minor invigorating bloodhound.
[5356.26s -> 5358.66s]  I dropped like his whole house.
[5360.02s -> 5361.14s]  This guy was moving.
[5362.74s -> 5365.38s]  You had a you haul in this frickin little room.
[5365.38s -> 5366.66s]  OK, hold on a minute.
[5367.99s -> 5369.11s]  Oh, look at that.
[5369.11s -> 5371.53s]  Look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[5371.53s -> 5374.57s]  Strengthens frenzied flame incantations by 10 percent.
[5377.88s -> 5380.04s]  Where do you usually get your first frenzied flame?
[5380.04s -> 5382.04s]  Because like the item that's not random,
[5382.04s -> 5383.16s]  we can go get that for you.
[5383.16s -> 5384.12s]  I just want them all.
[5384.76s -> 5386.86s]  That's what I mean.
[5386.86s -> 5387.98s]  We can we can go get them.
[5388.70s -> 5390.46s]  I've never done it, so I don't really know where they are.
[5392.58s -> 5394.74s]  Well, I'm sure someone in your chat will make a fully
[5394.74s -> 5405.82s]  fleshed out diagram labeled which one of these is more efficient 3fp every 2.5
[5405.82s -> 5413.56s]  before fp every 3.5 which one mathematically it gets you more and you
[5413.56s -> 5418.58s]  don't want to play path of exile no you're gonna ask that question and you
[5418.58s -> 5430.86s]  don't want to play okay but yeah we just got in a lot of stuff or HP fire damage
[5430.86s -> 5434.10s]  I'm gonna keep that one on all right cool oh this is fun I like this this
[5434.10s -> 5440.62s]  is actually really cool yeah I didn't expect that like this much to get thrown
[5440.62s -> 5445.62s]  at us I think it was very easy to get very confused and overwhelmed in the
[5445.62s -> 5449.14s]  first like 45 minutes to an hour so I think we're good did you go back to the
[5449.14s -> 5453.34s]  word you go through I ran up to the dragon communion area and that's all
[5453.34s -> 5458.91s]  like all that's all the same so we can go warp to the shack now do the shack let
[5458.91s -> 5465.03s]  me just yeah because if you have it then I should have it too then right the
[5465.59s -> 5475.03s]  I love this shack you got a shadow walk-in weapon okay I wonder what that
[5475.03s -> 5482.94s]  does if these mods are funny this this armor strengthens bestial incantations
[5482.94s -> 5492.33s]  by 10% strengthens bestial incantations by 10% neat it just does them both but
[5492.33s -> 5498.15s]  they're the same when the frenzied flame left grandsacks behind they presented
[5498.15s -> 5502.91s]  this rare madman skeletal mask of the fire Giants to hide among the peasants
[5502.91s -> 5517.42s]  fleeing limb grave that's pretty crazy lore let me level up I'm gonna just dump
[5517.42s -> 5526.36s]  it into let's get bigger up to 20 or make any decisions okay all right market
[5526.36s -> 5532.56s]  hold on sit back down sit back down are we doing another we are we're doing
[5532.56s -> 5538.96s]  another kill ourselves difficulty change yes okay because there is a co-op
[5538.96s -> 5544.73s]  difficulties and I feel like that might be overriding though it doesn't have an
[5544.73s -> 5549.77s]  easy it only has normal and hard and master it like that should be fine okay
[5549.77s -> 5583.70s]  hold on frenzied flame frenzied flame read more descriptions when Hayatah
[5583.70s -> 5587.66s]  joined the militia protecting Farramazula they domed this treasured
[5587.66s -> 5591.96s]  emboldened talisman of restoration as they liked how it looked that's it
[5591.96s -> 5598.26s]  that's all the war nights on horseback are deadly foes they see all below from
[5598.30s -> 5602.58s]  their lofty position meeting little meaningful resistance as they charge
[5602.58s -> 5625.86s]  ahead it's accurate yeah they liked it they like the way it looked you'll get
[5625.86s -> 5646.77s]  that come on I got it nice watch out it's the perfect human all right
[5646.77s -> 5664.52s]  market what do you got I deleted them I killed him all right who's in here but
[5664.52s -> 5675.12s]  your foolish ambitions to waste skip we already know the oh Leo Leo nine
[5675.12s -> 5686.62s]  misbegotten the fellow man I I was like I was mashing role and I never rolled
[5686.62s -> 5723.01s]  you got this whoa how come I didn't roll excuse me excuse me no I'm fine what
[5723.01s -> 5727.73s]  though no no really though no no no really though no no really though what
[5727.73s -> 5734.09s]  I didn't dodge through that no no like really though huh really though I dodged
[5734.09s -> 5739.24s]  right into it like there was no iframe you saw do you literally saw that that
[5739.24s -> 5742.64s]  freeze-frame that that has me very concerned because I saw a lot of people
[5742.64s -> 5749.56s]  on the reforge saying that their dodge rolls had no iframes the mod you're
[5749.56s -> 5757.06s]  using removes iframes no it does not does it I know that you can stand still
[5757.06s -> 5760.66s]  and roll and you do this move and that definitely has iframes wait hold on
[5760.66s -> 5766.72s]  there's a different dodge I know that dodges but I think I thought dodges still
[5766.72s -> 5776.85s]  could dodge the iframes are different in the mod yeah should we try this when you
[5776.85s -> 5782.65s]  change difficulties like hard changes the amount of iframes you have what let
[5782.65s -> 5807.14s]  me try the new one but that didn't really help but it didn't work good luck
[5807.14s -> 5821.43s]  like I just got lucky on that that was too early no how do you play a from
[5821.43s -> 5830.57s]  software game without iframes that seems like oh mega difficult we have to parry
[5830.57s -> 5845.60s]  everything my game crashed there probably is iframes but it's probably
[5845.60s -> 5850.97s]  somebody just said in chat and this is true yeah I don't want to do this I
[5850.97s -> 5853.65s]  would like to remove that because we're going to change our muscle memory
[5853.65s -> 5860.03s]  completely and it's gonna ruin every single other game you ever play wait
[5860.03s -> 5863.55s]  what's gonna ruin your muscle memory changing if there are iframes if there
[5863.55s -> 5867.11s]  and we have to learn where they are then we're never gonna be able to play Elden
[5867.11s -> 5872.16s]  Ring ever again normally they're supposed to be the same on normal I did
[5872.16s -> 5876.84s]  have us choose adept so maybe the iframes are like slightly changed and
[5876.84s -> 5884.65s]  we should just switch back to normal mode if that were the case but I did see
[5884.65s -> 5891.89s]  a lot of people in the mod comments being like hey my dodge doesn't work hmm
[5891.89s -> 5897.24s]  and I was kind of praying like that won't happen to us I'm opening my world
[5897.24s -> 5903.76s]  to you and I'm gonna walk you through choosing normal mode okay was it's way
[5903.76s -> 5909.61s]  harder it was way harder this way it'll be easier to play the regular game it's
[5909.61s -> 5915.17s]  just tighter iframes wouldn't that just make you better at the game no I don't
[5915.17s -> 5920.92s]  think so because it then you lose opportunity to dodge with more iframes
[5920.92s -> 5924.48s]  and I think would actually make you play worse because the there's only there's
[5924.48s -> 5928.72s]  only one way to dodge and getting that perfect iframe then when you play
[5928.72s -> 5932.04s]  normally it's like you're gonna get hit because you did it wrong you know what I
[5932.04s -> 5943.26s]  mean you get it why is she here once we actually I have to oh I'm
[5943.26s -> 5967.64s]  table Melina can you go away no she's fine you're just touching me all right
[5967.64s -> 5984.16s]  what incantations do you have okay lame ones for losers lame sling lame
[5984.16s -> 5990.71s]  fortification eel I don't want to heal I just want like the frenzied flame
[5990.71s -> 6014.99s]  catch flame and flame sling catch flame is godlike okay um we need to exhaust
[6014.99s -> 6032.26s]  some dialogue here right so we have we both of the smithing stone change but we
[6032.26s -> 6042.58s]  only need one so that's good yeah yeah although I don't really have enough
[6042.58s -> 6053.78s]  money sell random items could yeah I guess I'll just upgrade the hell out of
[6053.78s -> 6059.99s]  this thing and again the Diablo items only need to be upgraded twice and
[6060.47s -> 6067.10s]  that's their max okay but upgrading a mythic or whatever is better than
[6067.10s -> 6074.44s]  upgrading a common and they require bigger stones so it's like a life steal
[6074.44s -> 6084.68s]  with lightning damage dex weapon and just get rid of it I want it strength
[6084.68s -> 6097.24s]  plus two poison moth light Frank holy shit this thing I'm gonna hold on to
[6097.24s -> 6117.78s]  this cuz cuz it's kind of crazy so I got a plus two yeah I'm ready to go
[6117.78s -> 6122.32s]  yeah I'm ready to although I do want wait I don't want to buy this other
[6122.32s -> 6148.24s]  thing be quiet I want to get this catch flame you feel this is good I've never
[6148.24s -> 6156.56s]  done any of this before I don't know is it any good a lot of it again with
[6156.56s -> 6168.24s]  reforged history is balanced differently sparks flame from hand okay I'll try it
[6168.72s -> 6179.22s]  I'm ready to go back to market we have better weapons now I mean you do oh wait
[6179.22s -> 6183.98s]  the actual is lit the shop what if there's anything there it's not random
[6183.98s -> 6201.92s]  so no it's not random okay um okay and then when you get here we're gonna sit
[6201.92s -> 6207.64s]  back down and we're gonna normal mode and hope that it has something to do
[6207.64s -> 6215.25s]  with the dodge frames that's what we can hope I feel like I've dodged things I
[6215.25s -> 6228.13s]  don't know at what point what happened um event text the top one okay the top
[6228.13s -> 6239.49s]  one mm-hmm down to yes okay hitting yes what did you do what did you do what did
[6239.49s -> 6250.50s]  you do oh my god what did you do I messed up you fucking idiot god wrong
[6250.54s -> 6270.05s]  one I hope we can dodge making making me so angry all right because I don't buy
[6270.05s -> 6274.45s]  that there's like oh there's a smaller amount of dodge frames cuz I was it
[6274.45s -> 6277.69s]  didn't even look like I was rolling the way I was getting hit like I must have
[6277.69s -> 6288.42s]  been hitting them pretty early to not even roll at all go test it I have I
[6288.42s -> 6311.34s]  frames again oh yeah I look looks yeah I do as well maybe ish well it's enough
[6311.34s -> 6335.74s]  for us to kill him yes enough yes we got it
[6335.74s -> 6361.98s]  ooh spell blade gloves talisman talisman carrying sword sorceries Santa
[6361.98s -> 6369.85s]  Frutata dude wild strike I forgot is like you can't stop you so is magic damage
[6369.85s -> 6373.01s]  fire damage or is it fire damage because I guess I should put this on it's fire
[6373.01s -> 6384.27s]  damage all right well now I can level up now the question becomes this I'm not
[6384.31s -> 6389.86s]  gonna blow up my character again I'm trying to do frenzied flame so that is
[6389.86s -> 6395.14s]  that just only faith I want to be like the the eyes you know burning and
[6395.14s -> 6401.23s]  everything like that I believe that would only be faith so I should do faith
[6401.23s -> 6408.65s]  and then enough strength index to put whatever item I want and then just
[6408.65s -> 6417.68s]  vigor and endurance vigor is a pretty good ability that people like vigor you
[6417.68s -> 6421.08s]  should look at extra life like a normal person I don't think you know what we
[6421.08s -> 6437.85s]  have activated every item is completely random could be anything magic damage
[6437.85s -> 6440.89s]  isn't fire bro I don't think you I don't think you understand what's going on
[6440.89s -> 6448.00s]  right now guys I don't think you understand the type of danger that
[6448.00s -> 6452.52s]  you're in I don't think you get it I think I'm just gonna go let's just do
[6452.52s -> 6457.27s]  bigger and endurance like I gotta get these out of the way your mom so low
[6457.27s -> 6460.47s]  walks in the room opens the door behind you and looks at your computer and sees

[6541.93s -> 6551.74s]  tell them to open it because it would be very helpful if it was open it's not
[6551.74s -> 6558.91s]  open and it won't be and won't ever will be okay what did I do wrong I just
[6558.91s -> 6575.14s]  steal 30% of your rooms okay so I want to get more arcane I think no no no no
[6575.14s -> 6582.75s]  no no no but on Fextral life where do you get your first frenzied ability I
[6582.75s -> 6591.47s]  could just look it up I guess but like a normal person it won't be there will it
[6591.51s -> 6596.19s]  it will it's not items are not random I just got common frenzied flame seal of
[6596.19s -> 6608.91s]  the frenzied fire it just was right here do it you won't you don't have the ball

[6706.93s -> 6711.77s]  that it did not hit things from I was very close that that's like closer than
[6711.77s -> 6715.97s]  some melee weapons yeah this thing stinks doesn't it it's does good damage
[6715.97s -> 6721.17s]  but it you do have to be very close oh my god that is a lot and you can uh you
[6721.17s -> 6728.92s]  can like chain cast it multiple times this is dramatically just fall off it's
[6728.92s -> 6734.36s]  really good though there is one that's like identical that's like greater flame

[6858.01s -> 6866.44s]  kill this guy man I love it when you blow little kisses at your enemies isn't
[6866.44s -> 6871.86s]  there's an item over here you don't want it I mean it feels like everything's
[6871.86s -> 6877.46s]  gonna be hard to compete with Diablo I guess these were Diablo I didn't you
[6877.46s -> 6883.66s]  got me there man that rare talisman of emboldening stamina regen 8% um yeah
[6883.66s -> 6909.94s]  good thing I picked that up sorry okay let's go pretty good all right I'm just
[6909.94s -> 6921.08s]  gonna stack faith now cuz this thing will just kill things oh what a mod chat
[6921.08s -> 6929.16s]  is like what are you talking about okay so what is the buff criteria for
[6929.16s -> 6933.94s]  frenzied flame stuff somebody put a big paragraph in the chat and I couldn't
[6933.94s -> 6939.04s]  read it I don't even know what the phrase buff criteria is like what in
[6939.04s -> 6942.98s]  Kent this day this is apparently specific buff criteria to make frenzied
[6942.98s -> 6953.26s]  flame do more damage it was spam oh no idea what you're talking about my are
[6953.26s -> 6958.22s]  talking about I understand there's there's no buff criteria the seal that
[6958.22s -> 6964.22s]  I use is frenzied flame get buffed does it get buffed from you know fire giant
[6964.42s -> 6973.86s]  oh that's a weird-looking wall use the frenzy seal and level faith you're gonna
[6973.86s -> 6983.96s]  do the German skip yeah the original German skip I made this up patented it
[6983.96s -> 7020.96s]  patented edited okay let's go electric flame grant me strength buffs fire damage
[7020.96s -> 7029.23s]  and the fire damage is Zeke tear okay frenzied flame seal buffs frenzied flame
[7029.23s -> 7034.54s]  incantations think it's fairly obvious well but that's that's not what it says
[7034.54s -> 7042.56s]  because this is the Diablo 2 loot version of it does that the base seal
[7042.56s -> 7047.60s]  itself is still the same okay so the the stuff that it says on it are additional
[7047.60s -> 7051.72s]  modifiers that it has besides the fact that it is the frenzied flame scaling
[7051.72s -> 7055.28s]  talisman okay so that was my question it has been answered completely and I am
[7055.28s -> 7062.47s]  very satisfied with my new grab of gear okay he jumped don't take any fall
[7062.47s -> 7068.24s]  damage in this mod really I don't really I'm just gonna say that because I hope
[7068.24s -> 7072.64s]  it's true I didn't I didn't take any either I feel like I should have I am
[7072.64s -> 7096.68s]  the frenzied club yeah am I wearing like yeah that I got fire and ice you're like
[7096.68s -> 7111.25s]  an anime character I took off the regen gloves stupid of me common acts of
[7111.25s -> 7120.79s]  Godfrey what okay cool 45 now I'm not going strength oh yeah common common
[7120.79s -> 7132.24s]  acts of Godfrey he goes to the grocery store does a bathroom minus two you make
[7132.24s -> 7137.52s]  chicken nuggets or a tuna sandwich I'm gonna go with tuna I would go with you
[7137.52s -> 7143.52s]  know you don't think people that like tuna are freaks no and you know I'm
[7143.56s -> 7148.80s]  really kind of sick of this weird this weird bullshit where if you like tuna
[7148.80s -> 7152.56s]  fish sandwiches you're something's wrong with you but that I've seen are you one
[7152.56s -> 7157.72s]  of those people I am one of those people because like fishes this is kind of
[7157.72s -> 7165.66s]  gross and then you mush it up you're like a mushed up fish how do you think
[7165.66s -> 7174.42s]  they make like a chicken patty you got me there actually and crab cakes are
[7174.42s -> 7177.62s]  pretty solid you got you got me what about like a how do you eat hot dogs
[7177.62s -> 7188.73s]  yeah I mean I I I take this L and I accept that I've been exposed good good
[7188.73s -> 7204.95s]  I think it's freaking me out it's flying weird I don't think my bow works or
[7204.95s -> 7216.58s]  maybe like an arrows don't work the way I think they are sleep Kane oh my
[7216.58s -> 7231.72s]  goodness there's so many things I think it's a once we get to a bonfire it's a
[7231.72s -> 7235.84s]  look at what I have you for gear situation yeah how do we normally you
[7235.88s -> 7244.08s]  gotta come in here to open this right stir humbly accepting an L is actually a
[7244.08s -> 7252.00s]  W I mean I still think that tuna fish is disgusting but I I see how my specific
[7252.00s -> 7256.64s]  line of thought to why it was disgusting is misguided but the thing is I feel
[7256.64s -> 7263.40s]  like people that say tuna is disgusting had a gross tuna at one point a great
[7263.40s -> 7267.20s]  childhood and a great understanding of like what food really is and they
[7267.20s -> 7274.17s]  weren't fed like mush's children because you know this day okay there's
[7274.17s -> 7280.65s]  like chunk light tuna is light tuna this solid tuna and there this is a
[7280.65s -> 7284.92s]  tier system with tuna fish off in the shelf at the grocery store chunk light
[7284.92s -> 7292.10s]  tuna is I do not like it it's it's kind of disgusting I actually don't like it
[7292.10s -> 7299.50s]  at all I think to describe it as chunk light has already got me pretty chunk
[7299.50s -> 7306.49s]  light tuna is it's not I don't not like it it's way too it's just it's not good
[7306.49s -> 7316.21s]  it's pretty bad do a poll and like what's the what's the good one solid
[7316.21s -> 7323.55s]  albacore tuna is like just call it solid white albacore tuna like actual fish
[7323.55s -> 7329.07s]  not like mush chunk light tuna I don't know what the scale is but it's not it's
[7329.07s -> 7334.51s]  a lower quality I don't know the words you're using it's it's just to determine
[7334.51s -> 7338.31s]  like the quality and the scale of the ingredients I don't know it's just
[7338.31s -> 7343.39s]  chunk light tuna it just means it like really is that a real term or no no
[7343.39s -> 7346.83s]  that's a real term that's that is actually on could light yes I don't know
[7346.83s -> 7350.11s]  why I don't know why it's called that but that's like isn't this all just
[7350.11s -> 7359.93s]  really disgusting sounding no yeah who the fuck is this person in the lobby I
[7359.93s -> 7371.42s]  don't think you could describe any food as chunk light and have it sound
[7371.42s -> 7382.50s]  appetizing just just protect me for a second chunk light tuna chunk light
[7382.50s -> 7387.74s]  tuna typically consists of skipjack but also may include yellowfin or big eye
[7387.74s -> 7392.70s]  tuna it features a softer texture and it tends to be darker in color with smaller
[7392.70s -> 7398.83s]  pieces and a stronger flavor that's why I don't like it there you go that's what
[7398.83s -> 7403.87s]  chunk light tuna is what it means and the kind you like is called solid
[7403.87s -> 7414.80s]  albacore well like I'm still like wouldn't just be easier to not eat tuna
[7414.80s -> 7422.17s]  but I like solid white albacore tuna I like the way they taste I like it it
[7422.17s -> 7427.82s]  tastes good with pretzels but wouldn't it be easier to not like it I don't know
[7427.82s -> 7433.31s]  what are some foods that you like that I don't like that green ketchup that green
[7433.31s -> 7439.03s]  and purple ketchup that's like fucking weird you like that stop implying that I
[7439.03s -> 7443.35s]  like that no one likes that oh you know I do not watch that on my permanent
[7443.35s -> 7451.94s]  record you can't do that to someone I'll never work again yeah it's kind of
[7451.94s -> 7458.20s]  gross when you know it's over at your very place and open up the fridge you're
[7458.20s -> 7461.32s]  like yeah grab a snack I'm like alright and I see you got that purple ketchup in
[7461.32s -> 7465.60s]  there and I was like no fucking way does a human have this you you go over like
[7465.60s -> 7468.44s]  to someone's house and they're like oh we're having burgers for dinner if you
[7468.44s -> 7470.92s]  want to stay in here like oh absolutely I would love that but like they
[7470.92s -> 7476.44s]  hand you a burger and like under your bun is purple ketchup you politely gonna
[7476.44s -> 7482.99s]  you just gonna politely eat that you're gonna not mention it I'll eat it but do
[7482.99s -> 7492.74s]  you mention it no okay then you take a bite and it really tastes like it's I
[7492.74s -> 7497.86s]  get it's sickening it's sickening to me yeah yes you want to like gag and like
[7497.86s -> 7505.51s]  oh shit I went mad yeah that can happen to people too much
[7505.71s -> 7518.81s]  too much her pulled ketchup I feel like you're the kind of guy that would eat
[7518.81s -> 7522.13s]  the eat the hamburger with a straight face and a smile and say no I actually
[7522.13s -> 7525.41s]  really like this no guys trust me I don't hate this no I actually were like
[7525.41s -> 7532.19s]  really actually like this but I say it that many times yes I think that that
[7532.19s -> 7537.32s]  was the most accurate thing of what you said of all of the whole thing you just
[7537.32s -> 7540.72s]  did the amount of times I say it is what's actually accurate here
[7540.76s -> 7574.95s]  what's up actually hurt a lot just burn ancestral stir-w randomly generated I
[7574.95s -> 7584.46s]  don't like tuna fish therefore you're gross come on what is this what is this
[7584.46s -> 7609.31s]  bullshit there's a lot of enemies out here be fine how did I not lock on well
[7609.31s -> 7613.90s]  I just mean like if you go to the store to buy food like you still do that right
[7613.90s -> 7620.11s]  and then yeah like there's tuna and then there's chicken next to it then you
[7620.11s -> 7625.96s]  willingly chew you're choosing tuna over something is there something wrong with
[7625.96s -> 7634.60s]  having options to eat why I don't want to honestly I believe that one day like
[7634.60s -> 7638.92s]  people talk about you know the rapture coming and it's soon and that one day
[7638.92s -> 7641.16s]  like the government's gonna take over and we're all gonna have to eat the
[7641.16s -> 7644.64s]  little pellets that they give us but like I would love to just eat pellets
[7644.64s -> 7652.96s]  every day I knew you were gonna say that no like our dog eats the same exact
[7652.96s -> 7658.12s]  pellets every single day every day of its life four years and it's good for
[7658.12s -> 7670.96s]  it and that's all it needs there's going through his dog food arc I see you just
[7670.96s -> 7674.64s]  never on my side we're just gonna they're just not on my side you know what
[7674.64s -> 7678.36s]  I I will agree with you on a couple small things here what that there's a
[7678.36s -> 7684.92s]  lot of stuff in there holy shit oh my god okay we need to take a look but
[7684.92s -> 7691.48s]  there's bonfire up here and we can do like we have 700 items to loot okay your
[7691.48s -> 7704.18s]  your issue here with with this is let me let me level up this is the this is the
[7704.18s -> 7707.78s]  strategy you hit him with a deranged argument and then you let him look at
[7707.78s -> 7716.72s]  his items there's no time to rebuttal I win free faith is pretty good I want the
[7716.76s -> 7725.35s]  fire damage one I have a really good helmet for you I see it oh I'm getting
[7725.35s -> 7730.96s]  ready to drop okay so what's what's going on again say it again say it again
[7730.96s -> 7734.44s]  no I think I'm good no no I wanted I do I had a rebuttal and I want to give it to
[7734.44s -> 7740.58s]  you and say your point again I want to eat pebbles okay I understand because
[7740.58s -> 7745.32s]  sometimes I think everyone's probably like this sometimes when you're really
[7745.32s -> 7749.76s]  busy there's a lot going on there's a lot of things happening it's like eating
[7749.76s -> 7755.20s]  food can sometimes kind of be a pain in the ass sometimes always right and unless
[7755.20s -> 7758.40s]  you're like I'm out at a restaurant and this this is like really good it was
[7758.40s -> 7761.72s]  prepared for me it's like a whole environment but if it's like day to day
[7761.72s -> 7767.44s]  if I had the senzu beans I'd just be chomping them I would I think I would use
[7767.44s -> 7771.16s]  it only for purposes of hey I know tomorrow is gonna be a really busy day I
[7771.16s -> 7774.80s]  don't have to worry about food cuz I'm gonna take the weird pellet that's like
[7774.80s -> 7779.93s]  700 calories and it's every nutrient I need I'll be alright I wouldn't want to
[7779.93s -> 7783.59s]  do that for every meal I feel like that you're kind of deleting an entire
[7783.59s -> 7791.03s]  purpose to be like alive as a human is like to enjoy food right like we enjoying
[7791.03s -> 7797.27s]  consuming food is like a huge deal what is the meaning of life eat that food
[7797.27s -> 7799.79s]  I'm serious I'm telling you it's probably pretty it's pretty high up
[7799.79s -> 7806.87s]  there I think humans getting enjoyment from food is way up there on the list
[7806.87s -> 7811.67s]  for you know our existence and if we weren't eating food then we might as
[7811.71s -> 7817.14s]  well just fucking die is what you're saying no I'm just saying that like like
[7817.14s -> 7823.31s]  think about it food social togetherness conversation around a table at a
[7823.31s -> 7826.63s]  restaurant you know what I mean like I don't think we're gonna not gonna go to
[7826.63s -> 7830.11s]  a restaurant and we're gonna pick the pill off the menu no fuck that I want I
[7830.11s -> 7833.79s]  want to take a bite of my broccolini and go oh there's garlic on here and hey
[7833.79s -> 7836.99s]  stir what do you think you want to try by the way how was that ball game last
[7836.99s -> 7842.58s]  night right I don't want to lose that my Twitter handle is stir loves food
[7842.70s -> 7850.48s]  that's what I'm saying somewhat I I'm aware but like I I wish there was a
[7850.48s -> 7853.72s]  pebble I would eat the pebble but I wouldn't want to eat the pebble for
[7853.72s -> 7856.84s]  every meal and you are going down a path of the pet like we're eating the weird
[7856.84s -> 7862.53s]  like ground up whatever bugs or something pebbles I don't want to eat
[7862.53s -> 7867.45s]  that for every meal stir who do you think made the first sauce and I mean
[7867.45s -> 7881.16s]  that what what and you expect me to have I don't know hold on let's let him work
[7881.20s -> 7891.58s]  through it who made the first sauce is there a clue in that sentence it's just
[7891.58s -> 7896.30s]  a question it's just a philosophical question who made the first sauce
[7896.30s -> 7901.32s]  philosophically who made the first sauce someone who thought their food was
[7901.32s -> 7905.78s]  boring but why but who what do you mean boring food was you need to eat food
[7905.78s -> 7908.90s]  for fuel back in like the caveman days what are you talking about why would
[7908.90s -> 7914.53s]  you make a sauce I'm gonna make a marinara sauce why you need food
[7914.69s -> 7918.57s]  tastes good it's enjoyable but your food is scarce you can't you know you can't
[7918.57s -> 7921.17s]  make like you get but you know you're not gonna make a sauce who made the
[7921.17s -> 7927.07s]  first sauce hey let me throw a counter argument back at you if all you eat is
[7927.07s -> 7934.95s]  pebbles what if you put those pebbles in like milk that'll be disgusting okay
[7934.95s -> 7941.26s]  what if you had a lifetime supply of these pebbles all right we can we can
[7941.26s -> 7948.55s]  we can walk and talk we can walk and talk okay what if these pebbles were a
[7948.71s -> 7957.53s]  little bit fruity or even chocolate who made the first sauce is all I'm saying
[7957.53s -> 7967.09s]  and I think like whoever made the first sauce is Jesus Christ no no no no no
[7967.09s -> 7978.60s]  follow him no but why I know you cannot doubt it I understand the argument of
[7978.60s -> 7982.10s]  and look this whole argument is fucking stupid I'm aware of that it's just I
[7982.10s -> 7991.43s]  was I was I was having a fun time I'm I just wished like sometimes I'm sick of
[7991.43s -> 7996.03s]  eating you agreed and I also want to say that if you like you're like you would
[7996.03s -> 7999.91s]  don't eat very healthy and you're like oh man I like vegetables are so lame
[7999.91s -> 8003.79s]  you start eating healthier you get more used to that food and you start to like
[8003.79s -> 8007.39s]  dude I dude I could really go from us for some asparagus right now you know
[8007.39s -> 8010.15s]  how like you're a child you all you want is chicken nuggets and then you grow up
[8010.15s -> 8012.31s]  and you're like you know actually asparagus you know I could go from
[8012.35s -> 8016.75s]  asparagus right now yeah so eventually the pebbles would grow on you to the
[8016.75s -> 8020.79s]  point they're like dude I could really hit a bowl of pebbles why but these
[8020.79s -> 8025.54s]  pebbles have a flavor to them you didn't say that do they taste a certain way
[8025.54s -> 8029.73s]  they don't have to also you're gonna want to pick this up you ran past like
[8029.73s -> 8038.38s]  the golden seed tree of deliciousness yeah the ancestral beast champion armor
[8038.38s -> 8041.82s]  of the succubus I think I think the issue that I'm having as well as
[8041.82s -> 8044.74s]  everybody else not just me everyone else in chat is asking the same question
[8044.74s -> 8051.63s]  yeah you okay so you're eating multiple yeah a bowl of these so I thought it was
[8051.63s -> 8054.87s]  like eat one and it was all of your nutrition for the whole day like a bowl
[8054.87s -> 8058.63s]  of pet like you're an adult you have to eat more than one pebble you can't go to
[8058.63s -> 8063.07s]  wait and dot and get one dot why would you want this why do you want to eat a
[8063.07s -> 8068.15s]  bowl of pebbles you're good it's just like I'm being realistic I don't want to
[8068.15s -> 8071.99s]  have to if I could eat one Senzu bean and be done I would love that but
[8071.99s -> 8076.19s]  realistically I'm gonna have to eat a bowl full of pebbles cuz I'm like a big
[8076.19s -> 8079.79s]  person get it on a whiteboard so I can look at it and I'll give I have one
[8079.79s -> 8091.61s]  final argument okay eats bowl of pebbles for nutrients okay I thought that was
[8091.61s -> 8094.53s]  part of the mod for a second and I was actually scared that something bad was
[8094.53s -> 8100.59s]  going on I don't what does that mean that's my final argument I don't I don't
[8100.59s -> 8107.03s]  know what that means that's your problem is that your favorite song or something
[8107.07s -> 8114.08s]  I don't get it how does it actually didn't know this eat the geese how am I
[8114.08s -> 8124.92s]  the most a zoomer there's no way I don't get it just forget it he doesn't know oh
[8124.92s -> 8134.40s]  it's the giga Chad song yeah yeah I only know giga Chad is the face that kind of
[8134.40s -> 8142.97s]  appears and leans in on my face has a song I did not know that so I win is
[8142.97s -> 8148.34s]  what you're saying I don't want I don't want to eat pebbles I would like the
[8148.34s -> 8152.78s]  option to eat one pebble to have all full nutrition but that's it oh you want
[8152.78s -> 8161.82s]  another argument actually sure what is our Elden ring character eating lots of
[8161.82s -> 8166.62s]  different shit actually runes runes we're not eating the runes make us
[8166.62s -> 8170.82s]  stronger all we need are runes we're not eating there's nothing else that we need
[8170.82s -> 8174.38s]  we're not eating them we're like absorbing them it's a but they're in the
[8174.38s -> 8179.04s]  air it's like a gas we're not eating runes we're eating runes all right can
[8179.04s -> 8187.54s]  we fight this boss or are you gonna keep weirding everybody out am I like
[8187.54s -> 8193.30s]  chats on my side no they're not no way okay let's beat this boss first try
[8193.30s -> 8198.48s]  you're gonna do a poll too late and I couldn't see what it was I think that
[8198.48s -> 8210.14s]  actually is a Maleketh what yes Maleketh man wait why are we getting another
[8210.14s -> 8217.24s]  mimic here cuz that's the way it be I but why we already pop all it's all
[8217.28s -> 8236.02s]  mimicked here now I'm not even casting I'm just cheering you on
[8236.02s -> 8246.75s]  well is it another mimic dear there's something wrong no it's not everything's
[8246.75s -> 8262.96s]  great yes I got a remembrance and I got a great rune I got a lot oh yeah cuz
[8262.96s -> 8271.58s]  it's not it's not randomized we actually I keep forgetting wait play that play
[8271.90s -> 8292.07s]  that song again okay you ready mm-hmm go why do you have that ready for that
[8292.07s -> 8302.54s]  moment that moment right there you play that when we die to the boss yeah how
[8302.54s -> 8311.14s]  do you not know anything about comedy keep it in mind okay go with let's go
[8311.14s -> 8324.64s]  25 faith let's go with yeah I also got a remembrance what is it it's uh the
[8324.68s -> 8330.73s]  grafted do we care about this or do I just take this and level up some of the
[8330.73s -> 8338.44s]  stuff do we care about what the remembrances do they actually work or
[8338.44s -> 8343.32s]  would they be yabla it's it's it's all every item that would normally appear in
[8343.32s -> 8347.04s]  the game is not randomized and is not a Diablo item the Diablo items are extra
[8347.04s -> 8351.16s]  okay so remembrance would just be the default remembrance stuff which would
[8351.16s -> 8355.52s]  be really really stupid because why would we want a remembrance item yeah
[8355.52s -> 8359.52s]  okay then they're not ancestral weapons so like they're not the cool ones
[8359.56s -> 8365.57s]  okay now I don't want to ruin this character because I could oh I have a
[8365.57s -> 8370.65s]  faith of bow a frost build-up faith of bow rare if you're interested in that
[8370.65s -> 8376.42s]  should I what should I get strength index do if I'm gonna be almost if I'm
[8376.42s -> 8380.39s]  gonna be almost a pure caster do I need to even put any points into any of this
[8380.39s -> 8392.74s]  if my plane eventually I think that's it right yeah here check this item out
[8392.74s -> 8405.24s]  hold on hold on he's holding I'm holding holding holding item I am oh what the
[8405.24s -> 8409.23s]  heck all right it's time to look through all of our items I'll see you in
[8409.23s -> 8414.90s]  like 30 minutes I'm looking through we got a lot of little gunk I'm gonna keep
[8414.90s -> 8427.74s]  this on thorns mind bestial incantations it's got a lot of sickles this thing is
[8427.74s -> 8449.68s]  actually amazing I'm gonna use this for now free HP ooh mm-hmm I'll keep the
[8449.68s -> 8467.69s]  three HP on or FP that's pretty good this one's better ooh this one's good
[8467.69s -> 8479.03s]  too yeah it's one two vigor and two HP every three seconds mmm that sounds
[8479.03s -> 8488.98s]  delicious this is frenzy flame though all right don't let me forget I have
[8488.98s -> 8509.75s]  this because I want it eventually okay I think I'm all right for now actually
[8509.75s -> 8514.27s]  let me hold oh I'm gonna look up the Diablo loot mod and figure out what is
[8514.27s -> 8527.98s]  actually the higher tier it goes common uncommon rare treasured ancestral
[8527.98s -> 8539.36s]  legendary mythical god-slaying that's a lot of tears there's a lot of tears yeah
[8539.36s -> 8551.69s]  frost damage okay so the friend how much the frenzied flame seal is how much base
[8551.69s -> 8558.23s]  just for existing how much damage did anybody know because this is ten percent
[8558.23s -> 8569.26s]  frenzied flame but this doesn't matter seven that's 20% bro that's Giants flame
[8569.26s -> 8585.68s]  incantations is be faith scaling right now this is C but incantation scaling so
[8585.68s -> 8609.88s]  this is 152 this one's like better for now I guess 20% normally all right what
[8609.88s -> 8624.41s]  about my weapons still better Lee mind I need some more strength to put this on
[8624.45s -> 8631.71s]  if I want to put on that lightning spear thing okay do you have any like plus
[8631.71s -> 8642.53s]  strength talismans I just got another slot I think I think so if faith one
[8642.53s -> 8648.95s]  there's a lot of numbers on the screen right now
[8648.95s -> 8664.38s]  great he every 5.8 seconds this is better kind of I guess all right let's
[8664.38s -> 8681.54s]  just go I think I know what I'm doing did you go in here did you even sit on
[8681.58s -> 8689.14s]  throne I started running through you didn't even do the funny sit on the
[8689.14s -> 8694.39s]  throne thing with me in the room oh well you were like looking at your items
[8694.39s -> 8736.34s]  fuck dude okay I got on everything I think is worth having on oh so I do have
[8736.34s -> 8741.63s]  a big question though what is going on with the that was two mimic tears in a
[8741.63s -> 8751.97s]  row why did that happen I don't know I think because we loosened up the the
[8751.97s -> 8757.73s]  overall pool of potential things it can be drawing from because we would like
[8757.73s -> 8763.14s]  widen to the important areas thing you know I mean there are no oh there are
[8763.14s -> 8766.38s]  two in the base game okay are there actually because I was trying to think
[8766.38s -> 8777.93s]  like I don't there shouldn't be two mimic tears pops as the regular stuff I
[8777.93s -> 8784.46s]  don't need it I don't want it oh it's one in a dungeon and one of the little
[8784.46s -> 8803.29s]  mini-dungeons okay that makes sense sounds good to me hot throne items
[8803.29s -> 8815.71s]  damage increase I don't all right so and where to now that was cool when I just
[8815.71s -> 8822.72s]  go on the left and do the the jail you love evergales just a boss right there
[8822.72s -> 8829.18s]  okay all right I mean just boss it's just a boss like it's just the boss bro
[8829.18s -> 8838.53s]  let's just get some runes Academy scroll where did you go oh you went down I see
[8838.69s -> 8868.19s]  how did you you really went all over here or whatever here we go coming I was
[8868.19s -> 8886.97s]  looking at stuff should be a chest in here somewhere I thought there was a
[8886.97s -> 8893.29s]  chest in here that's not that's you okay what the hell I'm just I'm making it so
[8893.29s -> 8901.10s]  it's easy to see everything all right let's do the average ill let's go to
[8901.10s -> 8905.70s]  summer jail yeah it's like not actually that close you got to go like all the
[8905.78s -> 8910.41s]  way around oh shit that's I think you're right but there should be it's not it's
[8910.41s -> 8913.21s]  not that you know what you're gonna give up when I say something's a little hard
[8913.21s -> 8918.53s]  let's stick to our guns here what are you guys doing over here wrong with you
[8918.53s -> 8941.66s]  guys I got a sacred tear hold on oh yeah me too definitely use it what's your
[8941.66s -> 8947.05s]  coolest item probably the axe that I have right now oh no probably the catch
[8947.05s -> 8964.94s]  flame it's the only thing doing damage it is right here yeah but you had to go
[8964.94s -> 8974.64s]  down further for that jump all right something very hard nothing can stop me
[8974.64s -> 8980.61s]  once I start swinging I've already won the fight I hope is a dragon bulls the
[8980.61s -> 9022.94s]  thief of fire nice my god oh my god flame of the fell God yes that thing's
[9022.94s -> 9040.36s]  probably pretty good that's not a frenzy spell better than what I have trash

[9101.87s -> 9107.19s]  to pick something else besides flavorless nutrients back it up you you
[9107.19s -> 9113.91s]  do come over and you open the fridge and it is like 20 tubs without labels all
[9113.91s -> 9119.38s]  filled with the same white paste mm-hmm well but what's in it though there's no
[9119.38s -> 9132.42s]  labels on it is a tuna fish it's not no it's it is like oh dude it's tuna this

[9164.00s -> 9168.72s]  answer because you want to make fun of my favorite food no no I'm sure it's
[9168.72s -> 9177.71s]  delicious just what is it I honest to goodness let's play yes I was just on a
[9177.71s -> 9181.47s]  rant about how I'm sick of eating and I wish I could have flavorless pebbles
[9181.47s -> 9187.03s]  like that means you don't have a food you like to eat I like a lot of foods
[9187.03s -> 9191.35s]  but I really am at the point where I'm transcending the human form and just
[9191.35s -> 9196.24s]  want to be a ball of energy can somebody else answer this question I just want to
[9196.24s -> 9209.39s]  bring up a point hey what's your favorite food my favorite foods tuna he
[9209.39s -> 9217.16s]  just wrote huh I think that's an item for you that's like oh that is a fire

[9240.78s -> 9245.14s]  emails that are burgers but I've been typecast I ate a burger one time and the
[9245.14s -> 9248.77s]  Wall Street Journal will not leave me alone about it I think it's all that I
[9248.77s -> 9256.67s]  eat okay all right okay chili verde burritos are pretty good I had one
[9256.67s -> 9261.32s]  earlier all right thanks Josh so Josh I have a question for you if you opened up
[9261.32s -> 9266.36s]  the fridge and there was a chili verde burrito made by a professional chef and
[9266.92s -> 9272.72s]  it's like it's arguably the best quality you've ever seen in your entire life but
[9272.72s -> 9279.82s]  it is surrounded on all sides by tuna fish sandwiches in the fridge will you
[9279.82s -> 9283.94s]  is it are you so rude is it so disgusting to you will you reach in and
[9283.94s -> 9290.14s]  will you grab that burrito mom my food touch the ketchup I don't like the ketchup
[9290.14s -> 9293.46s]  or my mashed potatoes touch my pee no no they're all the same plate and they're
[9293.46s -> 9302.41s]  all wrapped under the same saran wrap like they're on the same plate wrapped
[9302.45s -> 9310.79s]  under the same saran wrap gross throw it away they're up there all under this
[9310.79s -> 9315.03s]  yeah I throw it away that's disgusting what whatever is under the saran wrap
[9315.03s -> 9318.59s]  in like a plate of tuna and you have like a burger in the middle it's gonna
[9318.59s -> 9322.19s]  taste like tuna okay I just was I was curious if that was like if it being in
[9322.19s -> 9326.11s]  like the same place was disgusting to you well they're gonna taste the same
[9326.11s -> 9331.82s]  nothing not I mean you can like burgers and you can like tuna but would you
[9331.82s -> 9336.34s]  like a burger that had like the scent and fragrance of like it's been sitting
[9336.38s -> 9344.98s]  in a saran wrapped tuna thing I'm just trying to get you to say you would you
[9344.98s -> 9349.82s]  would like eat or you I don't know I'm just trying to get you to talk to me I'm
[9349.82s -> 9358.67s]  talking to you but I just feel like I'm not saying what you want me to say it
[9358.67s -> 9364.38s]  means you didn't wrap it good enough I got some cool stuff and I want to look
[9364.38s -> 9370.55s]  at it let's get up to this bonfire up here we can also do this area and then
[9370.55s -> 9375.99s]  maybe get some some larval tears up here watch out there's a large doggy and not
[9376.03s -> 9394.09s]  the good kind I think it's a lot of help you know you fell off I fell I'm fine
[9394.09s -> 9402.04s]  remember why is your only talking point food why am I getting blamed for this
[9402.04s -> 9407.61s]  you're the one that brought up the nutrient pellets it's a pretty common
[9407.61s -> 9414.64s]  talking point for you haven't you done like it's here lists of like every kind
[9414.64s -> 9432.22s]  of food in existence I mean I've done some of that stuff you've done like the
[9432.22s -> 9437.24s]  cereal tier list and the fast food tearless Avenue I've done tearless on
[9437.28s -> 9448.60s]  things I like yes yeah yes would you be would you do the waifu tier list waifu
[9448.60s -> 9453.88s]  war to figure out who your waifu is waifu war yeah it's it's one of those
[9453.88s -> 9457.06s]  things where you choose there it gives you two images and you got to pick one
[9457.06s -> 9461.12s]  and it goes all the way down to the end round of 256 to figure out who your
[9461.12s -> 9470.74s]  waifu is I've just been 200 rounds on this yeah that's the only way to know
[9470.74s -> 9481.33s]  for sure oh what did you get I ended up having to pick the hell-taker main
[9481.33s -> 9487.30s]  character and Satan all right can I just say Ursula and we can move on Ursula
[9487.30s -> 9498.71s]  Ursula wasn't on my list it's a good pick I can't hit on Ursula unless she is
[9498.71s -> 9519.11s]  inside a Saran wrap of tuna big laugh by the way shut up wait has even faking
[9519.11s -> 9529.04s]  it this whole time I'm gonna I'm gonna push you all right make sure you get
[9529.04s -> 9575.92s]  your seal fucking speechless why it's my favorite NPC in the game German if I
[9575.96s -> 9580.60s]  ever came to like does it to visit you yeah and you were that old the legs
[9580.60s -> 9584.48s]  didn't work you're hiding in a bush pretending to be a pot I'd do the same
[9584.48s -> 9602.20s]  to you no no I fell I fake laughed again whatever I don't care coming wait am I
[9602.20s -> 9606.25s]  jumping off too I mean what else is up there besides I mean we could do the
[9606.25s -> 9611.75s]  little boss up there maybe I mean there is a little boss up there there is a
[9611.75s -> 9614.59s]  little boss but I'd have to go all the way around wouldn't okay yeah no it's
[9614.59s -> 9622.84s]  too late now yeah yeah we got bigger fish to fry doing it is pretty good on
[9622.84s -> 9630.10s]  the stove right watch out dragon I would say I pretty much recommend that there
[9630.10s -> 9643.72s]  goes talking about the food again you just killed that in one hit yeah all
[9643.72s -> 9652.60s]  right so where's our destination would you like anything in particular you
[9652.60s -> 9657.40s]  want to do I I'm feeling very strong I feel like we're following the same path
[9657.40s -> 9662.80s]  we did the first time though yeah like this would just take us back to the
[9662.80s -> 9667.40s]  glint stone Academy we do like like what's like a different way that we
[9667.40s -> 9672.08s]  didn't go last time we didn't really do anything underground last time really we
[9672.08s -> 9676.44s]  didn't do like knock wrong we didn't do the we did we also just kind of ran
[9676.44s -> 9679.56s]  through Caelan I feel like we could handle Caelan we could probably handle
[9679.56s -> 9683.24s]  as early as things are I feel like you know what let's like go back get a
[9683.24s -> 9687.40s]  bonfire take the road up to Caelan there's a church along the way I think
[9687.40s -> 9693.40s]  there's a reforged boss in that church really like not usually there but it
[9693.40s -> 9720.96s]  might be randomized shit out of me okay I was expecting more goofy mods um I
[9720.96s -> 9725.68s]  don't think they really exist for Elden Ring there aren't a lot first of all
[9725.68s -> 9730.84s]  there aren't a lot I was looking into some goofy mods and then um they're hard
[9730.84s -> 9736.98s]  to merge together yeah it's like the effort versus goofy reward and then it's
[9736.98s -> 9740.82s]  like one armor piece in the game is like that one's like Batman's armor then
[9740.82s -> 9744.66s]  we're randomized and we'll never find it and never even know it was there I mean
[9744.66s -> 9748.58s]  that would be kind of funny to be in like a Batman costume I thought it would
[9748.58s -> 9751.86s]  be funny you know you go to the roundtable hold and like the main guy
[9751.86s -> 9756.50s]  there is Batman like that'd be funny yeah but I already said Donald Duck that'd
[9756.50s -> 9774.27s]  be kind of funny um let's let's find closest bonfire oh that's actually
[9774.51s -> 9783.59s]  amazing that's one of the things that gets buffed if well we can't really do
[9783.59s -> 9788.19s]  it but I think that's one of the schools of magic that's buffed with warlock if
[9788.19s -> 9807.23s]  you play the actual reforged for real dragon at the dragon spot unless that's
[9807.23s -> 9815.00s]  a distant I remember it being fake is this one fake
[9815.00s -> 9842.74s]  seems wiki wheel well seems like it's going to die a lot of health I'm doing a
[9842.74s -> 9856.67s]  sneeze build right now yes sneeze on this guy I'm too short

[11110.70s -> 11123.40s]  not have died to that but then they spawned on me okay so he fills the whole
[11123.40s -> 11127.06s]  area with scarlet rot it's actually not that bad because we have all the items
[11127.06s -> 11141.83s]  that give like HP regeneration are countering a bit of the scarlet rot okay

[11207.46s -> 11222.04s]  dies only 2400 or what is what that's it who the hell's this who actually is this

[11316.62s -> 11324.39s]  also be a way to go down I think you are correct I think you're right I
[11324.39s -> 11335.52s]  remember this one might have been one of the weird ones where there's like all
[11335.52s -> 11339.60s]  the way to go on like down like a weird hidden floor yeah is it that way is it
[11339.60s -> 11355.24s]  this one that's what I'm asking I don't know we need to find out stir you can
[11355.24s -> 11358.72s]  have fun with that dog you need help I think you know what I'm on it you know I

[11367.94s -> 11380.75s]  a way down um let's ago I think it's higher up on the hill hey dude have you
[11380.75s -> 11386.52s]  ever slipped a disc yes right here um there was a while where I thought that
[11386.52s -> 11390.92s]  the chest pain brought but I thought that was a disk problem but turns out it
[11390.92s -> 11398.87s]  probably isn't oh yeah there you go there you go never did but he thought he
[11398.87s -> 11414.78s]  did interesting room not this one not this one they had it coming
[11414.78s -> 11427.19s]  ooh that's kind of good turtle talisman I guess maybe not when it comes to the
[11427.19s -> 11432.34s]  random shit you can get in the Diablo 2 mod I'm sure that's something we have
[11432.34s -> 11445.78s]  on some way better potentially potentially all right we could go do the
[11445.78s -> 11451.44s]  bird tree the one that's in Caleb over here we should go to the church the
[11451.44s -> 11460.82s]  smoldering church go to the earth tree and then go to the Caleb ruins I think
[11460.82s -> 11470.06s]  that's the plan what do you think yeah no okay I'm with you you watch it mister
[11470.06s -> 11480.56s]  you watch it buster hey listen listen buster I'm gonna be putting up with this

[12114.65s -> 12123.54s]  scaling with arcane I believe Diablo Mon does that oh I need 40 faith to use it
[12123.54s -> 12127.46s]  but it scales off of arcane it does not scale off of faith that kind of sucks oh
[12127.46s -> 12145.84s]  that's sad well cool weapon why are you going faith because I want to do the
[12145.84s -> 12155.16s]  frenzied fingers spells like we'll even get that far wait wait wait wait wait

[12275.57s -> 12283.17s]  here the frenzy spell I think they're all along that right route there's the
[12283.17s -> 12294.58s]  one tower that gives you the grab one cut them out this is the wrong way we're
[12294.62s -> 12306.04s]  on the wrong way dude yeah yeah we have to actually go up this little thing up
[12306.04s -> 12336.40s]  here the first somber smithing stone they go fun don yeah we do have the
[12336.40s -> 12346.45s]  Academy keys well dong hey also right around here is the the smithing stone
[12346.45s -> 12353.81s]  mine I'd be down for that we could go we could go fill up on stones yeah I'm
[12353.81s -> 12359.40s]  gonna stone up we haven't done a stone up run ever I want to get stoned in here
[12359.40s -> 12362.68s]  let's go there a bonfire this is a bonfire down here isn't there yeah yeah

[12401.95s -> 12405.31s]  of feel you on that but I think this thing that I'm using is really not that
[12405.31s -> 12431.05s]  great so I still have room to go crystals that's crack I had a lot of
[12431.09s -> 12449.64s]  help now let's just like zoom zoom like in out grab the Duffy keep going got
[12449.64s -> 12463.68s]  him got him watch out bear when they group up like that the fire does a lot
[12463.68s -> 12498.85s]  now common sacred celebrants rib break okay strength lightning is this this
[12498.85s -> 12504.08s]  scales with faith but is this better than what I have right now I don't know
[12504.08s -> 12522.89s]  I'm gonna have to sit down and look at all this oh not right now later look at
[12522.89s -> 12527.17s]  all these there's so many of these talismans and they all kind of say the
[12527.17s -> 12541.94s]  same words yeah we need to like sell them all they're by worth a lot yeah
[12541.94s -> 12564.38s]  aren't she's on the mall it's made about a waste to come down here I didn't
[12564.38s -> 12568.10s]  realize it was like I love this area is higher level than smithing stone two and
[12568.10s -> 12579.66s]  three still not bad to have yes I want to fight the boss button that's all
[12579.66s -> 12593.72s]  right uncommon sacred battle hammer of the glint blade I saw how I heard sacred
[12594.77s -> 12602.74s]  30 strength come on strengthens glint blade sorceries by fit what a wacky item
[12602.74s -> 12621.00s]  it's just like I don't even need to I just that's wacky so that's a faith
[12621.00s -> 12627.48s]  weapon that boosts sorceries and is a big heavy blunt weapon interesting common
[12627.48s -> 12641.30s]  sacred iron cleaver same deal this one though be scaling I think it's not super
[12641.30s -> 12645.81s]  worth looking at anything that is a common rarity really because I think
[12645.81s -> 12650.85s]  this is like better than what I have common rarity for a weapon does 0.9
[12650.85s -> 12657.73s]  percent damage a mythical weapon does 2.4 times damage so they just
[12657.73s -> 12666.61s]  exponentially scale I see unless the mods are on a common or like insane I
[12666.61s -> 12687.73s]  guess and care like you know we need that good loot for the guild god did you
[12687.77s -> 12711.69s]  give me rot Wow that's a lot good yeah this is all going in guild stash don't
[12711.69s -> 12717.12s]  be able to upgrade every single weapon to plus three or four at least was five
[12717.12s -> 12727.14s]  plus ten the drama yeah the Diablo weapons go to plus two all of them like
[12727.14s -> 12732.50s]  every song oh okay all of you have like a mythical weapon then it requires high
[12732.50s -> 12737.26s]  level smithing stones to get to upgrade it but they're all okay I thought it was
[12737.86s -> 12749.94s]  and that is a plus two that's why I'm saying it's a little bit of a waste to
[12749.94s -> 12753.18s]  be getting these smithing stones because you'd want to upgrade a mythic ideally
[12753.18s -> 12756.94s]  and then you aren't really ever gonna use these here let me get them let me get
[12756.94s -> 12767.30s]  them let me get this guy okay I heard him once I don't want you to get all the
[12767.30s -> 12772.26s]  credit I'm gonna die why did I let you do that why did I let you do that
[12772.26s -> 12780.30s]  because I don't have I don't have any healing I had to commit oh come on you
[12780.30s -> 12798.50s]  can beat him I still feel like the dodge is off I really do I promise you the
[12798.50s -> 12806.78s]  dodge is still wrong I know the dodges is actually slightly different I think
[12806.78s -> 12810.78s]  they removed there is a like input delay normally an Elden Ring that they
[12810.78s -> 12818.89s]  removed so as such your dodge timings may actually be a little off from
[12819.77s -> 12825.54s]  normal Elden Ring this a serious yeah I am I'm not I wouldn't joke with you man
[12825.54s -> 12846.90s]  what I joke about that yeah something does still feel strange when I hit the
[12846.90s -> 12851.90s]  dodge button now whether that's I'm getting hit in the middle of dodging or
[12851.90s -> 12855.66s]  is it happening earlier yeah my brain is having trouble with it
[12855.74s -> 12890.77s]  hi bear god dude I can't go I'm stuck all right I'm good okay we're good that
[12890.77s -> 12900.10s]  is terrifying me it is very scary oh I know where they other the other frenzy
[12900.10s -> 12906.30s]  flame thing is in that small village up in the on the top of that one hill where
[12906.30s -> 12915.12s]  all the like frenzied rats are yeah oh yeah is the whole village there's a
[12915.12s -> 12920.04s]  whole like frenzied village mm-hmm and they're all insane and their heretics
[12920.04s -> 12927.65s]  and we need to kill them all and then continue their traditions I think we're
[12927.65s -> 12947.38s]  being chased okay round two wild strikes I'm just gonna keep going what if it
[12947.38s -> 12951.98s]  kills you again though we need your expertise you better help because it's
[12951.98s -> 12996.46s]  wild strike time okay what the fuck I'm really good no I'm telling you I think
[12996.46s -> 13002.90s]  the dodge is fucked I'm telling you it's not I sure I'm sure I'm sure that I
[13002.90s -> 13009.42s]  watched that happen did it to myself nearly on purpose and I'm very sad that
[13009.42s -> 13017.26s]  I did because it really what I don't want to be dead well we got it I got all
[13017.26s -> 13033.60s]  the items anyway I got a legendary something they're getting new I need to
[13033.60s -> 13037.20s]  like sit down you know what we need to sell all this crap I'm gonna confuse
[13037.20s -> 13043.28s]  myself let's go back to brother kale because in my brain like literally every
[13043.28s -> 13046.96s]  single one of these is like the same because I have to hit X to look at what
[13046.96s -> 13050.84s]  it actually does yeah yeah but in my brain I'm dead right now I can't do
[13050.84s -> 13064.45s]  anything so let's go to kale okay I know it's the gloves but it's just like we're
[13064.45s -> 13068.53s]  picking up so many things that I've just random stats on them that everything's
[13068.57s -> 13079.06s]  kind of gets lost okay um zero bonfire here somewhere isn't one right there's
[13079.06s -> 13082.86s]  one down the elevator and you should be you should be able to teleport without
[13082.86s -> 13093.08s]  going down there don't you have to vote for it yeah you're right he's right
[13093.08s -> 13106.25s]  again I mean when you have like 30 of these in your inventory it gets kind of
[13106.25s -> 13110.84s]  hard to differentiate between which one is what we definitely have to go sell
[13110.84s -> 13140.12s]  all these or most of them coming back mmm maybe some no I'll get endurance
[13140.28s -> 13173.50s]  sort by time picked up item type order of acquisition god okay we we fail in a
[13173.50s -> 13178.88s]  vote I'm just I'm just testing that out to see what it looks like we we failing
[13178.88s -> 13198.56s]  okay so who would you say is winning right now neither one of us I think
[13198.56s -> 13211.16s]  you're winning you know he's truly winning God and his servants what are
[13211.16s -> 13218.60s]  you buying here I'm selling that's what you wanted to sell things what do you
[13218.76s -> 13226.03s]  I've heard my weapons that I'm not gonna be using all right I'm gonna dump all
[13226.03s -> 13233.92s]  these talismans all right let's 2fp every I mean I don't I don't know if it's
[13233.92s -> 13251.67s]  worth holding on to some of these but whatever that's 1.7 fire damage dealt I'm
[13251.67s -> 13254.99s]  gonna just get rid of the ones that don't have three things on them right
[13254.99s -> 13264.51s]  let's holy damage or 3hp to one lightning damage one 3fp for three years
[13264.51s -> 13284.24s]  six is eight if forced it huh or seven's kind of good extra lightning
[13284.24s -> 13289.96s]  damage taken I think I'm just gonna get rid of anything that doesn't not
[13289.96s -> 13294.20s]  whatever I'm just gonna go for it I'll keep that just selling any basically
[13294.20s -> 13299.68s]  anything that's not equipped and I don't want to equip is gone unless it seems
[13299.68s -> 13310.04s]  really interesting we're a specific ask but these are only worth a hundred they
[13310.08s -> 13334.60s]  are but they're kind of just clogging up the inventory yeah keep that on 1.3.2
[13334.60s -> 13354.02s]  I'm not gonna put this on probably this one's kind of good I think all right
[13354.02s -> 13391.52s]  oh my god that's a lot of money I don't have enough god damn it it was 86 all
[13391.52s -> 13405.66s]  right 15 endurance is fine I'll keep that for now oh hey well then I came
[13405.66s -> 13412.88s]  plus to 3hp oh my god those are good holy shit 5fp every three and a half
[13412.88s -> 13423.45s]  seconds 3.2 seconds yeah we never even went south and crossed that bridge do
[13423.45s -> 13428.95s]  you still want to go back into a lid we should go south to the ailing village to
[13428.95s -> 13435.27s]  get you your frenzy fire yeah we kind of we kind of went that way and then we
[13435.27s -> 13439.71s]  decided to do something else and now we're I guess we're mm-hmm is that what
[13439.71s -> 13442.71s]  we're doing is that the plan yeah so let's go to gate front we got a long
[13442.71s -> 13447.69s]  yeah so I'm gonna need you to bring up a very engaging topic for the for the
[13447.69s -> 13457.39s]  journey okay dig down into your bag of tricks I am pressing it but it will not
[13457.39s -> 13477.23s]  go aw shucks aw shucks I don't think we can go we can cut across here I think
[13477.23s -> 13488.20s]  actually I think we can let's just go from here okay yeah you can I just
[13488.20s -> 13492.84s]  assume everywhere in Elden Ring is like a gigantic cave that will prevent you
[13492.84s -> 13500.24s]  from going anywhere or not cave cliff cliff a big valley yes it does end up
[13500.24s -> 13518.50s]  that way a lot of the places though oh I got a rare power bottoms Greaves ooh
[13518.50s -> 13543.87s]  let's just check on the map you know making sure we're good where are where
[13543.87s -> 13552.61s]  are we going here for the who's fighting who here oh it's a bear a bear

[14572.03s -> 14577.04s]  is the part of the game where it started to be like cliff hell this place is
[14577.04s -> 14581.88s]  cliff hell every time I'm like oh I have to like go down to that like Western
[14581.88s -> 14588.00s]  area down here in the the island place and then I how do you get to that bridge

[14806.88s -> 14809.96s]  like there's there's two of the worst bosses in the game there's like an
[14809.96s -> 14818.71s]  invisible necromancer and then something just as bad and also it's very very dark
[14818.71s -> 14824.08s]  are we scaly I don't know we didn't buy any lanterns or anything that was
[14824.08s -> 14828.85s]  probably pretty pretty bad idea I've got a torch yeah torches on a lathe to
[14828.85s -> 14837.17s]  equip it like yeah that's like that's way more like immersive annoying watch out

[15155.42s -> 15160.70s]  really wouldn't mind but I don't think that they would initiate that

[15168.75s -> 15176.01s]  don't I don't think so there's a weird jumpy there's a weird jumpy over here

[15184.04s -> 15202.28s]  cave down here oh there's usually a good there's like every once in a while the
[15202.28s -> 15205.96s]  Diablo loot overrides what would normally be like a cool item that's
[15205.96s -> 15213.22s]  funny there's like a it's like a spike punch shield okay and I think it's neat
[15213.26s -> 15228.22s]  okay we said sir you're just saying words a lot of them that form a sentence

[15376.80s -> 15388.42s]  whole pebbles conversation you think ooh presser trotteries Queens this too many
[15388.42s -> 15392.78s]  words there there just is you know and you know what I'm talking about that's
[15392.78s -> 15398.12s]  the thing right I do know what you're talking about or you're like streamed a
[15398.12s -> 15404.52s]  while and your words become like like I don't know ten out of ten drunk but it's
[15404.52s -> 15407.80s]  like we can't say a sentence but it's not just a sentence it's like it's like
[15407.80s -> 15412.76s]  ten it's like six to seven words in a string that have no real connection to
[15412.76s -> 15420.20s]  each other he fell in oh so you yeah we got to keep going down that's why I like
[15420.68s -> 15424.04s]  type racer stuff is harder because you know the words like they don't flow
[15424.04s -> 15427.40s]  together like what it what is what is it yeah me gods restorative traveling
[15427.40s -> 15433.08s]  maiden gloves it's like it's a lot of random words I'm right there with you
[15433.08s -> 15456.11s]  can you frenzy flame this thing yep it's like the text for the items here are
[15456.11s -> 15461.11s]  tongue twisters all of them they are they're really long they really don't
[15461.11s -> 15478.30s]  make any sense there's no way to speak the English language I've tried I wonder
[15478.30s -> 15499.02s]  what attack you're gonna do that one I wonder what I'm gonna do such a boring
[15499.02s -> 15505.14s]  playthrough this is just you and I are both gonna do the same one move oh my
[15505.14s -> 15541.73s]  god oh damn oh shit what's that oh treasured mad tongues chain leggings of
[15541.73s -> 15559.61s]  fury holy damage but you can roll into enemies and hurt them yeah I've seen a
[15559.61s -> 15577.82s]  couple items with that pretty sick I'm gonna try it sounds funny I've got my
[15577.82s -> 15584.49s]  second moon veil very cool not gonna use it trying to do some strength stuff can
[15584.49s -> 15588.55s]  only find this club all right do you want to go to very Lucario do you want
[15588.55s -> 15593.01s]  to do a lid what's what um there's the other tower where you can get the
[15593.01s -> 15598.98s]  madness grab let's set you up man you want to set me up you you deserve it
[15599.02s -> 15608.22s]  you're one of the good ones thank you I guess these hoes ain't loyal all right
[15608.22s -> 15614.79s]  where we gone back to the where we were trying to go before frenzy I'm trying
[15614.79s -> 15622.66s]  tower to remember frenzied flame village up here I don't know if you see my
[15622.66s -> 15630.72s]  markers I know where it is yeah it's like part of this whole tower and and we
[15630.72s -> 15634.16s]  have the crystal tunnel there but I think we have to go all the way from
[15634.16s -> 15639.48s]  back here you can go up the middle of like from the lake but we haven't got
[15639.48s -> 15645.16s]  any good waypoints from we were trying to cross the whole lake earlier here
[15645.16s -> 15649.28s]  here here here here we here I know I know we're going it's just a long trek
[15649.28s -> 15679.85s]  all right remember my game takes slightly longer than newest to load yeah
[15679.85s -> 15686.52s]  I know I wait for you every single time with my overflowing vessel of great
[15686.76s -> 15692.48s]  patience of the fourth born can you say that five times fast I don't even
[15692.48s -> 15699.70s]  remember what I just said I really am just saying words they all they're right
[15699.70s -> 15708.28s]  about me and I'm also gonna stop saying hey there's a thing we can go in right
[15708.28s -> 15715.62s]  here I'm just we're just gonna go you know um we can't get to it from this way
[15715.62s -> 15719.54s]  we got to go into the lake again trust yeah you have to go through the middle
[15719.54s -> 15724.40s]  right yeah cuz then there's one of those uh there's one of those cliffs that you
[15724.40s -> 15739.16s]  know just just the world hey you got to go from the middle don't you think the
[15739.16s -> 15745.24s]  earth would be better off if it was perfectly flat oh and I'm not saying
[15745.24s -> 15748.80s]  like flatter a theory I'm saying like it's a round planet still but it is it
[15748.80s -> 15755.52s]  is perfectly flat no mountains no hills no rivers well gravity exists so it
[15755.52s -> 15763.23s]  doesn't really matter so I mean like you know wait you mean like every dome you
[15763.27s -> 15769.08s]  mean literal flat like the whole thing is flat everything yeah yeah so you just
[15769.08s -> 15776.43s]  want like the Great Plains across the entire world yes yes um so you're
[15776.43s -> 15781.59s]  talking about you want the roller coaster tycoon default grass yes all
[15781.59s -> 15788.76s]  right um I want I want default grass map from the tutorial level of like that
[15789.32s -> 15797.34s]  game just no just everything is exactly just green I I feel like this probably
[15797.34s -> 15804.14s]  reasons why it would be bad but but here's the trade-off it's like a dwarven
[15804.14s -> 15808.34s]  ecosystem underground where these massive caverns and these oars we've
[15808.34s -> 15811.62s]  never heard of that can let the elves live forever but we won't let them have
[15811.62s -> 15827.53s]  them but they get them the world above is flat but because that's all flat we
[15827.53s -> 15831.17s]  can't have rivers so obviously we wouldn't have water to like anything I
[15831.17s -> 15835.58s]  feel like I just skipped ten minutes forward in a YouTube video like you're
[15835.58s -> 15849.52s]  just something else completely going on all right uh let's do it what was he
[15849.52s -> 15854.04s]  cooking the great question
[15854.52s -> 15863.43s]  could have just said no the end like a valid answer was just no I don't think
[15863.43s -> 15871.29s]  that would be better but no one wants to like speak up conflict-averse how windy
[15871.29s -> 15879.05s]  would it get I feel like if it was all just roller coaster tycoon grass wouldn't
[15879.05s -> 15883.93s]  it be I don't know question would it we would change the dynamic of all of our
[15883.93s -> 15893.83s]  meteor a lot of wind come from like the the melting of the ocean I feel like
[15893.83s -> 15897.79s]  you know ocean melts into the clouds and if there was no water on the surface
[15897.79s -> 15917.34s]  because it's all flat then the ocean wouldn't be melting so true yeah I've
[15917.34s -> 15921.70s]  been a lot of question marks okay so if ice melts into water and then water can
[15921.70s -> 15927.75s]  change into gas behind you call that melting why can't water melt into gas
[15928.19s -> 15935.56s]  um water blame the flame cleans me in there if you care you probably don't
[15935.56s -> 15960.10s]  care oh that hurt well I thought that was you hitting me from behind me all
[15960.10s -> 15964.78s]  right stop please I get this guy has been in the same animation the whole time
[15964.78s -> 15970.39s]  and he's just wild striking I don't know he's just doing wild strike whatever he
[15970.39s -> 15980.36s]  was doing this thing's one hit can you just like fucking go crazy oh thank God
[15981.24s -> 15988.79s]  it evaporates like vapor doesn't freeze into water it condenses there you go
[15988.79s -> 15994.88s]  there's your answer it condenses and that guy's not like you're not no one's
[15994.88s -> 16002.15s]  doing question marks to that guy well that's baked with real science not
[16002.15s -> 16008.43s]  nutrient pellet science that you're using when's the last time you open like
[16008.43s -> 16014.70s]  a science book don't you think just like feeling from your gut like how the heart
[16014.70s -> 16021.07s]  feels is enough do you really even need to know like oh I need to like read a
[16021.11s -> 16024.75s]  biology book to understand how my body were you just kind of like you sit on
[16024.75s -> 16029.07s]  the toilet shit happens you don't need to know the mechanics of the world to
[16029.07s -> 16040.36s]  understand that water can melt well okay water can evaporate okay and then why
[16040.36s -> 16046.86s]  why does the word melt it turns into here because melting implies melting
[16046.86s -> 16050.30s]  implies okay correct me if I'm wrong melting implies a heat source does it
[16050.30s -> 16059.23s]  not well if it gets hot enough out the water melts like melting doesn't that
[16059.23s -> 16068.84s]  mean like it needs to melt there is heat involved early melting is from solid to
[16068.84s -> 16083.20s]  liquid melting implies liquidification does it imply that or are you like
[16083.20s -> 16089.12s]  expecting that it can only mean that I think you're fighting semantics right
[16089.12s -> 16103.78s]  now in education guys don't blame any I'm a dropout I dropped out of high
[16103.78s -> 16118.58s]  school this is not an ace ball do my brain is melting listening to you oh but
[16118.58s -> 16125.66s]  he can say that and I can't say water melts just hurt the turtle I jumped on
[16125.66s -> 16130.38s]  him and it turns the turn on him I just tried to stand on him I stir if there's
[16130.38s -> 16133.62s]  one person I have ever heard of that would ever hit the turtle it's you I
[16133.62s -> 16139.36s]  didn't hit him I tried to be on his back yep like imagine you're a small child
[16139.40s -> 16153.74s]  didn't you ever want to like ride a big dog I'm busy yeah stir the type of guy
[16153.74s -> 16161.10s]  to r1 r1 r1 the turtle and then be like actually wild strike is just hold l2 for
[16161.10s -> 16168.15s]  me it's a lot simpler than r1 r1 r1 I can't handle that many button presses
[16168.15s -> 16178.10s]  stir the type of guy to hold l2 on the turtle okay you didn't even talk to the
[16178.10s -> 16186.22s]  turtles I I don't need sorceries alright let's go fight something let's
[16186.26s -> 16190.26s]  go fight let's go fight like regular karya or you know what we're doing right
[16190.26s -> 16193.94s]  now and why we're doing it yes I but I know we're doing the frenzied flame
[16193.94s -> 16198.06s]  village do you know how close we are and how far we traveled to get here for you
[16198.06s -> 16202.08s]  but you keep pausing and talking about sauce I'm not we've been traveling the
[16202.08s -> 16214.96s]  whole time you've been saucing I just need to look at the map and you're
[16214.96s -> 16241.38s]  fighting all these guys there's the item here got violet okay any any any map
[16241.82s -> 16253.10s]  I would like to look oh that's sad that dog has a collar okay so yeah it's the
[16253.10s -> 16259.38s]  tower there's a village we got to go down this hill I don't know who came up
[16259.38s -> 16270.40s]  this hill the melting conversation you had is why America isn't top 10 in stem
[16270.40s -> 16288.51s]  I haven't been in a classroom in like 15 years wait top 10 in stem there's like
[16288.55s -> 16298.46s]  not even there's barely more than 10 countries guys when you get to be over
[16298.46s -> 16303.02s]  30 you stop giving a shit about what melting versus condensation you give a
[16303.02s -> 16310.35s]  shit about fucking taxes all right got a fucking lawn to take care of shit I
[16310.35s -> 16317.82s]  think my game crashed oh true no way dude every time you turn on the news

[16321.94s -> 16340.85s]  three countries something something in the fucking water today something in the
[16340.85s -> 16353.94s]  sauce today what name another one Canada Mexico I mean come on all right
[16353.94s -> 16362.28s]  Finland um Switzerland Sweden and a little like a show-off scholar here you
[16362.28s -> 16373.03s]  want to play GeoGuessr again wait I'm not done Germany France England who should
[16373.03s -> 16377.05s]  I you want you want more should I go shake it gone unless you want to play
[16377.05s -> 16392.86s]  GeoGuessr again Ecuador my world is open to wanderers Egypt what ranking is
[16392.86s -> 16422.50s]  Egypt in stem no they were talking about stem cells right where I can like
[16422.50s -> 16432.28s]  like how many years before I can have gills sir I gotta tell you I know this
[16432.28s -> 16435.24s]  has been like a jokey conversation we were just like pretending that we don't
[16435.24s -> 16438.16s]  actually know this stuff but you have to understand that there are chatters that
[16438.16s -> 16441.40s]  are going to hear you say that and they're gonna they're gonna think even
[16441.40s -> 16449.79s]  less of us oh I'm well aware I am totally and completely aware and I you
[16449.79s -> 16457.30s]  know I had an awakening I shouldn't even say more you know what I shouldn't
[16457.30s -> 16471.86s]  say more I don't know if I want to hear about the awakening I'm not sure about
[16471.86s -> 16485.03s]  that I don't know if I want to hear about the awakening tell us all I'll
[16485.03s -> 16489.15s]  say about the awakening is and that some people are the I don't hear about the
[16489.15s -> 16493.35s]  awakening I don't want to hear about the awakening I think it's too much eyes
[16493.35s -> 16500.59s]  too much I feel like this is the kind of shit you're gonna start talking about
[16500.59s -> 16504.47s]  fucking like crystals and gems and you're gonna start talking about like
[16504.47s -> 16508.97s]  fucking earth being flat your alarms are going off because you're like
[16508.97s -> 16514.75s]  something this motherfucker won't even say I don't want to hear about the
[16514.75s -> 16527.76s]  awakening all right fair enough all right how about this you DM me what like
[16527.76s -> 16532.40s]  one sentence of what the awakening is it's not that bad if I like leave out
[16532.40s -> 16541.38s]  the important parts all right tell me like we could have we can talk about it
[16541.38s -> 16551.01s]  later but like to it wouldn't make sense the full context is required of which
[16551.01s -> 16559.29s]  you would not have there is awakening I went like down I was concerned about
[16559.29s -> 16562.97s]  your awakening so I went down here it's I don't know why we called it an
[16562.97s -> 16568.63s]  awakening it's not an awakening I forgot it's hard to even relate to what the
[16568.63s -> 16573.14s]  original conversation was because I can't remember what we were talking about
[16573.14s -> 16579.02s]  talking about how many countries you can name no like after that um about all
[16579.02s -> 16582.74s]  people thinking that we're thinking we're done right like oh they're dumb
[16582.90s -> 16586.58s]  they don't know anything about condensation yeah that that was where we
[16586.58s -> 16589.54s]  left that and then you said I had an awakening and I don't know if I can
[16589.54s -> 16595.32s]  even say it on stream the short version is which is fine is that when I stream
[16595.32s -> 16601.36s]  with you huh I never get Twitter DMs but when I stream with you afterwards
[16601.36s -> 16609.43s]  sometimes I get a few that are like can you not talk about that ever again wait
[16609.43s -> 16613.63s]  for like from people you know or from like no no no no like random people
[16613.63s -> 16619.68s]  that I like long messages about like why what I said was actually like there
[16619.68s -> 16623.24s]  did you know like I could imagine getting one like it was kind of really
[16623.24s -> 16627.12s]  saddening to hear you say there was only ten countries because actually I'm from
[16627.12s -> 16631.80s]  one that isn't one of those ten and I really felt like I was personally so so
[16631.80s -> 16637.40s]  you're so your concern is you're here on like on like a comedy stream and you're
[16637.40s -> 16640.72s]  afraid that you're gonna get DMs where people think that you're actually mean
[16640.72s -> 16643.68s]  the thing you say on the comedy stream well it's kind of what you were saying
[16643.68s -> 16650.97s]  is that people will think we're that dumb and I don't know why also I don't
[16650.97s -> 16655.89s]  know why I called that an awakening yeah that to me you were talking okay you
[16655.89s -> 16661.49s]  let's let's go over some very factual information we you first of all you were
[16661.49s -> 16665.05s]  like I don't even know if I want to talk about this on stream and that was like
[16665.05s -> 16671.85s]  transitioning out of like like yeah wouldn't be better if the earth was flat
[16671.85s -> 16676.53s]  you know like you don't have any turbo and I'm just like yeah what do you mean
[16676.53s -> 16679.61s]  but and then you know what I had an awakening recently let me tell you all
[16679.61s -> 16691.05s]  about it what was it there's a longer there's a longer awakening I just you
[16691.05s -> 16700.89s]  know that's but too long didn't read that's all you need to know okay and
[16700.89s -> 16709.19s]  first of all I what is why do you have Twitter DMS open open what why don't you
[16709.19s -> 16715.03s]  why would you have Twitter DMS open for any Twitter user to just DM your ass
[16715.03s -> 16722.46s]  why not stir I I'm telling you right now you just told like tens of thousands of
[16722.46s -> 16726.22s]  people that you have open DMS on Twitter like what like what is the worst thing
[16726.86s -> 16735.83s]  please do not I fucking go oh my god man like do you just not interact with your
[16735.83s -> 16750.95s]  fans no okay I thought there would be more new watch out for the big hand big
[16750.95s -> 16755.27s]  hand it's up on that hill up here but I don't think you can actually get up on
[16755.27s -> 16759.36s]  that hill unless you come from the other direction because this is where it's
[16759.36s -> 16764.30s]  hill hill cliff hell when you look at the map so yeah where were you want to
[16764.30s -> 16780.74s]  go to Caleb yes now I don't really use Twitter don't use discord because here's
[16780.74s -> 16784.34s]  the thing let's do you want to let's just be real you want to be real for a
[16784.34s -> 16789.58s]  second if you have if I have Twitter DMS open and somebody DMS me and I just don't
[16789.58s -> 16793.42s]  if I just ignore it because I mean like look let's be realistic it's possible
[16793.42s -> 16797.82s]  that and that I was thinking the stand angle thousands of them could come in in
[16797.86s -> 16801.30s]  a week or a month period I'm telling you right now I'm not gonna read them I'm
[16801.30s -> 16804.46s]  not gonna read them all I'm just not going to and if somebody sends like a
[16804.46s -> 16808.46s]  bunch of text to something right you let's say you brought like two or three
[16808.46s -> 16811.74s]  paragraphs like a Twitter DM and I just don't even open it because it's just
[16811.74s -> 16815.98s]  overwhelming this too much then you spent the time to write to me and I just
[16815.98s -> 16823.19s]  didn't even respond there you go okay I don't want to I don't want to interact I
[16823.19s -> 16827.63s]  mean how many people just wrote to you in your chat that you didn't respond to
[16827.67s -> 16831.51s]  just now while you were saying that that's difference there's a character
[16831.51s -> 16839.22s]  limit is there you can write some pretty long I guess remove I guess remove my
[16839.22s -> 16852.06s]  nightbot TLDR it can be pretty overwhelming and I I prefer to not do it
[16852.06s -> 16861.72s]  TLDR mm-hmm why did you open this I don't know we were just up here and we
[16861.72s -> 16867.50s]  can't really get to where we were trying to go to so I think we probably do need
[16867.50s -> 16877.14s]  to like leave unless we you are you are with time you are just going on my
[16877.14s -> 16882.82s]  screen I oh I'm sitting in place that happens a lot around these altars
[16882.82s -> 16888.59s]  actually is where we've had a lot of the desync it does seem to happen here okay
[16888.59s -> 16896.10s]  do you want to just pick a place to reset us um yep we are going into the
[16896.10s -> 16904.90s]  moldering church do not touch this bonfire let's do you get random DMS
[16904.90s -> 16909.43s]  from random strangers I don't to me that's just like oh hey let me open up
[16909.43s -> 16914.03s]  my Twitter DMS oh that's a picture of somebody giving a double my finger and
[16914.03s -> 16918.75s]  their asshole okay that's cool I don't think people consciously thinking of
[16918.75s -> 16923.11s]  stir and being like you know what I'm gonna interact with stir that has never
[16923.11s -> 16927.96s]  been a problem and I don't think like maybe they're like oh because I said
[16927.96s -> 16931.08s]  like oh I saw them stream like for one day it'll be a problem then it will go
[16931.08s -> 16935.32s]  back to like you know I'm just like alone in my basement lights off
[16935.32s -> 16949.86s]  boundaries Bob yeah you got I accept them before with you guys come on don't
[16949.86s -> 16964.62s]  act like we haven't whoo it's putrid theodoric's not keep going through cave
[16964.62s -> 16975.50s]  yeah keep going cuz that didn't even hurt I mean my weapon is still I didn't
[16975.50s -> 16980.86s]  never gave it plus levels I think like we starting we were starting to hit
[16980.86s -> 16986.78s]  some things that oh my god scale on us yeah we probably should upgrade after
[16986.78s -> 16994.04s]  this you don't want to interact with random people no I really don't that
[16994.04s -> 17004.71s]  make me a bad person no it makes me somebody that is set hold on counter to
[17004.71s -> 17010.70s]  that mm-hmm you used to do like like packs East meetup I can't I can't do a
[17010.70s -> 17017.62s]  meetup that's different though or the very opposite ends of the spectrum
[17017.62s -> 17022.14s]  there I think that's different though I mean we're all there for that purpose of
[17022.14s -> 17025.58s]  like kind of being in the same place bunch of gamers bunch of streamers are
[17025.58s -> 17029.65s]  there a bunch of youtubers bunch of people that to me that's different like
[17029.65s -> 17034.45s]  I'm going to like a twitchcon or a packs East to go that I can all hang out and
[17034.45s -> 17040.46s]  talk to everybody that's like the point you know let these let these flames fly
[17040.46s -> 17056.25s]  frenzy these fucks pretty good I'll cover you it's just running by me that's
[17056.29s -> 17067.22s]  oh my god this whole hallways full why is there a wild time were you just
[17067.22s -> 17071.18s]  surprised at what type of enemy was in this total randomizer where every enemy
[17071.18s -> 17074.86s]  is random you said is that a bear like you were shocked I feel like we've seen
[17074.86s -> 17088.38s]  a lot of bears we have seen we've seen a few bears is that dead is brought yeah
[17088.38s -> 17103.08s]  this is building oh cuz I've rolled I'm an idiot I keep forgetting that do I
[17103.08s -> 17109.42s]  even have any of those things no why would we have one of those okay where we
[17109.46s -> 17119.69s]  go from here we've can I touch the thing I have rock yeah yeah I don't know where
[17119.69s -> 17124.68s]  you go from there they're like one of these walls must be was different
[17124.68s -> 17127.76s]  you want well asking what's the difference between randomizers this
[17127.76s -> 17132.44s]  randomizer is like kind of doubly weirdly randomized because we have
[17132.44s -> 17138.20s]  Diablo 2 loot and it's a lot of it and then we have this is all it's all
[17138.24s -> 17143.17s]  different we're more likely to get weirder bosses and in boss rooms and
[17143.17s -> 17151.49s]  the items have a lot of bonus extra weird stats coming back I am for you I
[17151.49s -> 17157.79s]  touched the thing because I was brought in but I like here oh well you go
[17157.79s -> 17164.28s]  underneath this someone shoot me you let this go up come off you go under so it's
[17164.28s -> 17167.60s]  not different at all I just we have Diablo 2 random loot what do you mean
[17167.60s -> 17174.88s]  like look at all this shit this is all like random shit and we have Elden Ring
[17174.88s -> 17184.66s]  reforged but we can't do this the actual classes so that's unfortunate I brought
[17184.66s -> 17203.47s]  us here to the scarlet rock cave all good hold on this at this Caleb trip has
[17203.47s -> 17211.14s]  been really I fucking did the dodge again we did like six circles to get to
[17211.14s -> 17217.28s]  Caleb by now we're in Caleb I'm not the place that I want to be in Caleb now we
[17217.40s -> 17221.80s]  got this the lever where do you want to be in Caleb I want to be in the place
[17221.80s -> 17236.10s]  where we can get some cool items whereas this one I have no idea uh can you just
[17236.10s -> 17247.15s]  go find it okay can you start a conversation sure so what was last time
[17247.15s -> 17259.76s]  you had it hmm does your jaw does your jaw click when you open it yes it does
[17259.76s -> 17267.42s]  how how far open does your mouth have to be before it clicks like mine's about
[17267.46s -> 17276.20s]  30 40 percent pretty much um I don't know I'm doing it now I don't know
[17276.20s -> 17280.22s]  happens it like weird spots sometimes it feels like it does it more than others I
[17280.22s -> 17284.29s]  remember I had like a long conversation with someone about this at one point
[17284.29s -> 17289.36s]  because Ashley sister is a dental surgeon and then I don't know I can't
[17289.36s -> 17298.38s]  remember what I learned that conversation started and stopped
[17298.38s -> 17303.26s]  instantly you know I know somebody that's a dental surgeon and I don't
[17303.26s -> 17306.10s]  remember anything I'm sorry I don't remember the whole thing like I feel
[17306.10s -> 17309.26s]  like I should be able to have more input on this conversation but honestly I
[17309.26s -> 17314.90s]  don't that just well you know what respect to you for acknowledging that
[17314.90s -> 17319.38s]  you don't know and not just kind of making up something you might half know
[17319.38s -> 17339.52s]  right I don't do that I could just talk just out here playing the game looking
[17339.52s -> 17343.24s]  for the lever for my I said I want to get the rod I had it I was already
[17343.24s -> 17352.10s]  built up he went on my website and bought a carry I'm looking like yeah
[17352.10s -> 17355.94s]  fine I'll do another carry for you on your Elden ring streams I'm looking I
[17355.94s -> 17368.62s]  found it I found it you didn't even find it I found it did you maybe oh and that
[17368.62s -> 17423.38s]  giant pile of enemies I ignored them oh god cool you found it cool um you find
[17423.38s -> 17432.95s]  it I was just giving you shit but then yeah I came up here and I didn't see it
[17432.95s -> 17440.33s]  up here and then that drops back down to where we were and it's like man what was
[17440.33s -> 17447.19s]  the point isn't something like in a weird spot I think so I think maybe you
[17447.19s -> 17451.27s]  can also go up on that I don't dude I don't know I remember hating this cave
[17451.27s -> 17454.35s]  because scarlet rot and they just need to make you hate yourself when you come
[17454.35s -> 17469.82s]  in here I thought you were ending your stream I thought you said I I thought
[17469.82s -> 17480.50s]  you said I gotta sleep I gotta sleep it's like oh my god I'm gonna be up at
[17480.50s -> 17486.63s]  4 a.m. tomorrow off something incredibly important I gotta sleep oh shit all
[17486.63s -> 17493.18s]  right then God you yeah take care he's gone he didn't say goodbye he just left
[17493.18s -> 17496.90s]  like if you miss this appointment tomorrow at 4 in the morning with three
[17497.10s -> 17506.69s]  gotta be up 4 a.m. yeah the doctors off it at 4 a.m. we're we're all booked up
[17506.69s -> 17514.78s]  but if you can come in at 4 a.m. still waiting for this door to open dude I
[17514.78s -> 17529.65s]  have no idea wait wait wait wait wait wait wait I'm remembering I thought you
[17529.65s -> 17539.04s]  played this game haven't you beaten this game before why don't you know this
[17539.04s -> 17544.84s]  doesn't come back down so we do we do have to do a loop oh oh oh oh I'm gonna
[17544.84s -> 17555.10s]  get scarlet rot you can just go wait at that door I'm just already following you
[17555.10s -> 17568.10s]  we got some marinara sauce on our boots some pesh penny pesto I don't know um I
[17568.10s -> 17577.82s]  think this is a like the Satanists at from software made this one and I think
[17577.82s -> 17589.59s]  there's an like an invisible wall right at the beginning the Satanists yeah like
[17589.59s -> 17594.03s]  every single time like a gamer gets aggravated and you like fuck millennia
[17594.03s -> 17598.55s]  fucking fucking a millennia like that energy exits your soul goes through the
[17598.55s -> 17602.71s]  game through the cords of the internet goes into Miyazaki they're all plugged
[17602.71s -> 17609.56s]  into him and he's like in his chamber oh yes oh yeah but it is like they breathe
[17609.60s -> 17624.30s]  it out of like a cone or something yeah like it's like that drop under the
[17624.30s -> 17628.22s]  elevator people are saying I think that's correct we did that we did do
[17628.22s -> 17634.86s]  that oh hey I found it you didn't see this it's right here there's no enemies
[17634.86s -> 17638.38s]  here there's no we haven't been here haven't seen that how did you not see
[17638.38s -> 17642.96s]  that bro I walked in here and I saw it immediately how did you I don't know
[17642.96s -> 17652.98s]  how you didn't see them Satanists well that's how they get you oh you Satan was
[17653.02s -> 17660.85s]  an angel himself and then you're in and they got you then we have to drop down
[17660.85s -> 17685.30s]  to get back to the door yeah did you drop yeah making sure all right you
[17685.30s -> 17688.50s]  ready to kill this boss in ten seconds ready I'm ready to kill this boss with
[17688.50s -> 17715.68s]  wild strike while you go should be fun how is this already dead I don't like
[17715.68s -> 17740.96s]  that tone that you had nice okay that is a lot legendary graven witches
[17740.96s -> 17745.52s]  clean-rod helm of what well I got the same one as you like exactly
[17745.52s -> 17752.59s]  intelligence are dying that's a lot of stats it's a lot but I don't really want
[17752.59s -> 17755.96s]  it we need it that's what I'm saying like a lot of stuff I'm getting is in
[17755.96s -> 17764.67s]  arc mind all this stuff that I don't want like where's the big boy smasher
[17764.67s -> 17780.66s]  all right we could keep going to the the thing at the archery was insane we
[17780.66s -> 17787.91s]  should probably upgrade our stuff don't you think I don't know what we need to
[17787.95s -> 17793.63s]  upgrade you want to run to I would like to run to the blacksmith guy again I
[17793.63s -> 17797.39s]  would like to upgrade the frenzy flame thing like it's pretty much the thing
[17797.39s -> 17811.67s]  I'm using warpo or we got to get to EG didn't work okay then we got to go fight
[17811.67s -> 17822.83s]  this giant salamander that takes no damage I vigor damn yeah you actually
[17822.83s -> 17829.18s]  want to fight this well I mean otherwise otherwise I just hear you I'm dead
[17829.18s -> 17832.38s]  already nevermind okay this thing has like a million health I don't think that
[17832.38s -> 17863.98s]  yeah we're not gonna kill us yeah no way I got you actually I'm gonna level up
[17863.98s -> 17874.70s]  yeah fire is bad on it yeah I can't level up because I died I got it sorry
[17874.70s -> 17892.47s]  don't we I you want to go get some ice cream let's do um we could just run to
[17892.51s -> 17904.12s]  the southern part EG to upgrade you wanted to upgrade I do yeah Ray LaCarr is
[17904.12s -> 17920.80s]  the the way to go but we don't have to do that I play five nights at Freddy's
[17920.80s -> 17928.06s]  to stir have you ever played five minutes of Freddy's no can we do a
[17928.06s -> 17932.46s]  stream where I just watch you I just stream you playing five minutes at
[17932.46s -> 17938.59s]  Freddy's we just kind of hang out sure all right cool it's an odd request but I
[17938.67s -> 17945.73s]  do it like I just get a bunch of snacks and shit and like and you just play and
[17945.73s -> 17949.73s]  we just watch you play I have never watched anyone play I like don't get it
[17949.73s -> 17955.05s]  I 100% don't understand five nights at Freddy's or like so I guess it'd be like
[17955.05s -> 17963.14s]  the raw the raw deal yeah is there a preference for like what's the good one
[17963.14s -> 17968.11s]  is there a VR ones good the VR one actually was pretty fun and what I played
[17968.11s -> 17977.65s]  of it but five nights at Freddy's 2 I think is probably the staple that's I
[17977.65s -> 17990.09s]  think the the apex of the series for a lot of people raw and then I'll just be
[17990.09s -> 17993.73s]  chatting I was laughing you and you get jump what's what's the dumbest game
[17993.73s -> 17997.69s]  you've ever gotten like scared while playing like the most scared you've been
[17997.69s -> 18007.12s]  but also like you really shouldn't have been scorned there was like there was
[18007.16s -> 18012.50s]  like three or four okay so in scorn this weapon container comes out of the ground
[18012.50s -> 18022.50s]  and I was not prepared for it and I screamed and it hurt my whole body I did
[18022.50s -> 18032.15s]  not expect it to be so recent or yeah now mine is a quake 4 hmm the quake 4
[18032.15s -> 18036.55s]  single-player there's a really dark area and I it it took me about an hour to
[18036.55s -> 18042.43s]  walk through slowly at the end of this level and if you like know the layout of
[18042.43s -> 18047.79s]  what you're doing it's it should take you about 30 seconds I'm kind of a jumpy
[18047.79s -> 18055.03s]  person though like I would say so even things that aren't supposed to jump scare
[18055.03s -> 18072.39s]  me they kind of do if they're quick I mean when quake 4 came out I was like 13
[18072.39s -> 18092.76s]  years old all right can I upgrade this who he sells cool stuff there we go all
[18092.80s -> 18105.22s]  right boom boom what did that do 172 scaling now on this thing nice do you
[18105.22s -> 18116.78s]  have a smithing stone 5 regular I do not I only have 4 yeah that's what my club
[18116.78s -> 18141.38s]  needs well I am gonna level up yeah plus 2 is the max on the mod yep can I turn
[18141.42s -> 18170.05s]  him off for a second me I'm gonna can I sit at the grace yeah 10,400 yet yet can
[18170.05s -> 18179.78s]  I have a do any crunchies I need 400 I feel like this happens a lot to you
[18179.78s -> 18186.03s]  they're constantly taking my crunchies well if you have extra crunchies then
[18186.03s -> 18202.09s]  you should be sharing them I need a level so I can equip some stuff all right now
[18202.09s -> 18211.75s]  I'm gonna be doing disgusting damage please don't accidentally shoot him you
[18211.75s -> 18231.90s]  take just a quick look some of the stuff I think might scale with faith whoa it's
[18231.90s -> 18249.54s]  to faith a faith scaling 35 strength but the only thing I have that scales us
[18249.54s -> 18266.54s]  eight yeah this is a one-hander though right no is it not anything can be a
[18266.54s -> 18284.10s]  one-hander it's true I think that's the only good thing I have for faith I think
[18284.30s -> 18292.13s]  the strength that's pretty damn good like I said a one-hander but well okay
[18292.13s -> 18299.52s]  well our last playthrough I did a big slow two-hander under that again yeah
[18299.52s -> 18303.04s]  but you weren't casting magic yeah but I wanted to be like I want to be a
[18303.04s -> 18323.89s]  predominantly spell caster oh follow me this is exciting we split that where
[18323.89s -> 18328.69s]  you're going we split that really well I mean we're going to carry a manner no
[18328.69s -> 18334.24s]  wait actually exciting I don't know where I'm going and you're gonna leave
[18334.24s -> 18368.94s]  the way yep it could be literally anywhere this whole wide open world yeah
[18368.94s -> 18402.72s]  can you frenzy this sure can easy that frost dump where are you taking me on a
[18402.72s -> 18421.16s]  date where are we going somewhere special I need to look at the map and
[18421.16s -> 18429.12s]  they won't let me look at the map I think it's this way hmm it's Applebee's
[18429.16s -> 18439.42s]  oh I love the riblets I know this should lead us to the the frenzied village where
[18439.42s -> 18455.42s]  you can get your your frenzy on I think I'm wrong no no no no I'm not it's a
[18455.42s -> 18465.48s]  long annoying path this is correct though I don't remember the last time I've
[18465.48s -> 18475.78s]  eaten an Applebee's like it's been a very very long time it's been a long
[18475.78s -> 18483.36s]  time yeah been a long time for me I think we go up here to the right then we
[18483.36s -> 18488.68s]  wrap around then we're up on the high ground it's just bears that just bears
[18488.68s -> 18493.28s]  everywhere Wow but bear seed Wow another bear are you serious there's more bears
[18493.28s -> 18500.67s]  there are a lot what is the staple at Applebee's what is the actual Applebee's
[18500.67s -> 18508.31s]  staple oh my fucking god don't please oh my god I got fucking killed by the bear
[18508.31s -> 18517.21s]  apparently enough enough bears dude just the stake of America I think it's
[18517.21s -> 18532.15s]  probably closer I don't know I don't know probably kind of forgetting I won't
[18532.15s -> 18553.33s]  let me look at the map so what's okay Applebee's Chili's Fridays what's
[18553.33s -> 18560.60s]  another that that tier of sit-down restaurant what's the best what's the
[18560.60s -> 18570.38s]  best what's the best one of those definitively which one is the best
[18570.42s -> 18577.65s]  Chili's whichever one's closest true they're all about the same I just remember
[18577.65s -> 18583.41s]  I remember being in a Friday's like one time not like I mean Fridays are all
[18583.41s -> 18591.21s]  right but I'd rather it be a Saturday the Olive Garden is the Olive Garden on
[18591.21s -> 18599.06s]  that tier it is right yeah for sure I would probably say Olive Garden gonna
[18599.06s -> 18605.51s]  say like red lobster and all that I don't remember this item actually is in
[18605.51s -> 18611.08s]  here this is a place well we'll find it eventually much over the gigantic axe
[18611.08s -> 18630.25s]  oh my face I just did a German scream I just I wanted to get this item because
[18630.25s -> 18638.51s]  it might be the frenzy fire all right I got the frenzy cookbook this crab I miss
[18638.51s -> 18646.68s]  I miss having wild strike already in God why do you have to be here I just want
[18646.68s -> 18684.10s]  to get the mask leave me alone why nothing to do with you such carnage okay
[18684.10s -> 18688.30s]  there is a giant over his still and I want to find the other frenzy spell I
[18688.30s -> 18702.15s]  think it's uh I think there is more up this hill there's like a chest yeah
[18702.15s -> 18708.63s]  Olive Garden I feel like Olive Garden is kind of a meme and people shit on it oh
[18708.63s -> 18712.99s]  Olive Garden oh yeah of course Olive Garden no don't forget the breadsticks
[18713.03s -> 18716.43s]  no but seriously don't they're good that's a that's a great thing to do soup
[18716.43s -> 18723.10s]  salad breadsticks actually is fucking pretty legit you're not gonna hear me
[18723.10s -> 18736.29s]  talking shit about soup salad breadsticks you're just not there there
[18736.29s -> 18746.36s]  balanced based even now the last time I ate at the Olive Garden it's been an
[18746.36s -> 18752.78s]  uncountable amount of years I don't I don't remember I am doesn't mean I
[18752.78s -> 18755.90s]  wouldn't because it's the closest there's a there's a Chili's near here I
[18755.94s -> 18759.78s]  mean I'm on team Chili's just again whatever's the closest what just
[18759.78s -> 18769.64s]  happened to me wait you died oh there was there was an invader here I died in
[18769.64s -> 18779.80s]  one hit yeah he's definitely is something off with the fucking roll I'm
[18779.80s -> 18787.68s]  telling you I'm not crazy yeah that was funny though cuz you went yeah it was
[18787.68s -> 18792.32s]  almost a song yeah like like normally in between those you'd be able to roll
[18792.36s -> 18799.45s]  that those are not like perfect roll catching doomsday swing I I just yeah
[18799.45s -> 18809.27s]  um there's something wrong it's been wrong the whole game I think it lets
[18809.27s -> 18812.51s]  you roll a little bit earlier out of hitstun because it buffers it differently
[18812.51s -> 18818.31s]  yeah but then actually you rolling earlier is like I do I don't know
[18818.31s -> 18822.39s]  something there I would do remember reading the change lock yeah it's not my
[18822.39s -> 18827.59s]  fault it's Jerma's fault I yeah yeah that's what your character did and then
[18827.59s -> 18833.36s]  you died I we need to work up there I don't know what where you are I'm
[18833.36s -> 18838.80s]  standing right on top of it oh I it respawned me somewhere else because I
[18838.80s -> 18856.87s]  don't know why oh I need to warp I can everyone's talking about vibes because
[18856.87s -> 18871.23s]  they're just all messed up right now you got a problem with the vibes do I do
[18871.23s -> 18878.80s]  something it's me isn't it are you where are you I'm traveling down from the
[18878.80s -> 18893.16s]  church and we just tell on vibes a funky right now inquisitor whatever that
[18893.16s -> 18896.32s]  inquisitor is here we need to kill we have to kill this inquisitor yeah I'm
[18896.32s -> 18913.35s]  with you oh we're good vibes are back vibes are good I need to sit down at the
[18913.55s -> 18940.41s]  bonfire because I have like I have no HP okay let's continue so what did you get
[18940.41s -> 18945.78s]  from the town I didn't finish looting it I got a frenzied cookbook but there's
[18945.78s -> 18950.21s]  more stuff down there that I think I want to get I think to our left over
[18950.21s -> 18954.37s]  here hold up before we go back down yeah this is the tower this is I know this
[18954.37s -> 18958.17s]  something at the top of the tower and it makes you go the top of the tower is the
[18958.17s -> 18966.98s]  grab let's get it I think you might have to come yeah do not oh okay I don't know
[18966.98s -> 18970.70s]  what I was doing I don't know what I was thinking I just like saw it and I
[18970.70s -> 18973.50s]  thought I don't know you've been jumping around all game and I was like oh you
[18973.50s -> 18976.06s]  wouldn't probably jump I don't know you've been jumping around all game
[18976.06s -> 18983.12s]  then I'm like oh he probably is gonna jump with me I don't know nobody saw
[18983.12s -> 18988.40s]  that from Vinny's stream that's fair and valid that I made you do it because I'm
[18988.40s -> 18994.55s]  smarter than you welcome everybody from vine sauce what's up playing some Eldon
[18994.55s -> 19002.83s]  ring co-op randomizer with Diablo 2 loot and some of reforged it's a little
[19002.83s -> 19011.28s]  messy but we are getting through it I mean what's a bowl of spaghetti if it's
[19011.28s -> 19021.22s]  not all over your shirt okay we I almost died again you're following me don't we
[19021.22s -> 19026.98s]  want to go up to the top of the tower no I mean no you're following me I am
[19027.30s -> 19040.06s]  you choose where to go it's off a cliff but thanks to the raid welcome everybody
[19040.06s -> 19062.36s]  vibes are back vibes restored okay get on your horsey this is not affecting me
[19062.36s -> 19068.26s]  at all it will when you get closer why do I feel like when I played before it
[19068.26s -> 19074.90s]  was very very far away it was just line of sight that's okay so that's weird I
[19074.90s -> 19082.77s]  remember being much much much I think there's a way worse angle you can come
[19082.77s -> 19115.06s]  at it from okay you climb I look at ancestral loot excuse me there's somebody
[19115.06s -> 19134.97s]  coming down the ladder what I'm coming somebody coming down the ladder all
[19134.97s -> 19147.96s]  right me me I'm ladder you missed the chest I'm killing these things first
[19147.96s -> 19159.66s]  god damn it no yeah I forgot it's it's not just an easy enemy it's like this
[19159.66s -> 19165.70s]  fucking thing up whatever the hell it's like rats and bugs all right I I thought
[19165.70s -> 19169.14s]  it was gonna be like the default shitty enemies but it's like a bunch of rats
[19169.14s -> 19175.82s]  and it's a huge flower these vibes are are way off I was like oh yeah these
[19175.82s -> 19179.06s]  guys die in one hit they're so easy wait that's right it randomized everything
[19179.06s -> 19210.75s]  there's a giant flower up there are you dead no close it's still alive it's got
[19210.79s -> 19222.49s]  a lot of hell what's going on up here what's going on up here damn it shoot
[19222.49s -> 19253.26s]  him oh god the vibes are a bit off but we have a message saying that they're
[19253.26s -> 19260.07s]  explaining something here Elden reforge changes the combat system so attacks
[19260.07s -> 19265.07s]  that you can jump over or duck under with the new duck are not I framed by
[19265.07s -> 19269.27s]  dodges there should have been a tutorial at the beginning of the game for this
[19269.27s -> 19275.58s]  but I don't think it worked because of the randomizer what how do you even how
[19275.58s -> 19281.74s]  would you even know what those attacks are I don't know basically any attack
[19281.74s -> 19291.74s]  you can duck or jump do not have iframes I don't even wonder which ones are the
[19292.22s -> 19309.33s]  did these vibes fucking stay these vibes smell they're rotting to buy a health
[19309.33s -> 19337.20s]  bar is I'm like a level two right now good all right all right where is it one
[19337.20s -> 19344.14s]  floor down you didn't have to come up here and told you there's a chest nice
[19344.14s -> 19362.09s]  yep yep yep yep yep yep vibes vibes vibes vibes vibes vibes I forgot what
[19362.09s -> 19376.65s]  that hold castle is over there check it out these a bonfire oh I bet you could
[19376.65s -> 19393.38s]  oh this must be a memory slot thing oh you do the thing we don't have it we
[19393.38s -> 19401.04s]  don't have the emote oh no emote bunch of losers showed up without the emote
[19401.08s -> 19411.57s]  okay so all right I got some cool spells I got some shoot whatever it is let me
[19411.57s -> 19426.54s]  see that helmet though what was it did they pick it up oh it's a talisman yeah
[19426.54s -> 19439.76s]  never mind there's another spell is it in that they're in the town somewhere
[19439.76s -> 19442.92s]  there should be another one I think a giant was just kind of a fit in the ass
[19442.92s -> 19455.58s]  I'm just maybe just run around and grab stuff I'll meet you back in the town you
[19455.58s -> 19467.41s]  got it where were you jumping to I don't know see the vibes that something's
[19467.41s -> 19471.05s]  going on tonight something with that you could I couldn't I frame on the jump I
[19471.05s -> 19491.38s]  can just normal Elden ring that's you can do that that's fine no vibe frames
[19491.38s -> 19504.58s]  it's true okay I actually have a health bar now did you eat pizza tonight well
[19504.58s -> 19510.02s]  that depends did you have pizza last night if the answer is yes is that pizza
[19510.02s -> 19514.34s]  leftovers that answer is yes then by all means he'd eat the leftovers make sure
[19514.34s -> 19517.98s]  you don't waste any of that you know it's still good if you've eaten to a
[19517.98s -> 19521.30s]  pizza yesterday there's no leftovers and you're ordering another pizza today I
[19521.30s -> 19535.09s]  would say probably I would say probably not I have a question about that you
[19535.09s -> 19538.77s]  could put any toppings you want on a pizza yeah like what a pizza is can
[19538.77s -> 19544.26s]  really vary can we kill this I ordered a pizza yesterday but the pizza you're
[19544.30s -> 19549.97s]  ordering today is vastly different the fuck that we need to we need to figure
[19549.97s -> 19553.49s]  out the dude we got to figure out the dodge thing because I can't dodge any
[19553.49s -> 19563.38s]  moves I have not been having that issue you just got hit five times we just
[19563.38s -> 19577.96s]  watched it I wasn't dodging though like okay give me he's gonna smack and see
[19578.52s -> 19590.37s]  see I uh you got hit he's gonna smack yep you got hit your vibes stink right
[19590.37s -> 19603.10s]  now your vibes are your vibes are awful right now all right we need to try
[19603.10s -> 19613.30s]  blocking all right doc can you are we gonna figure this out or what how the
[19613.30s -> 19625.18s]  dodge works in this game I guess how do we figure that out we have to find a
[19625.18s -> 19630.53s]  default enemy and just try to swing like dodge through stuff okay okay this crab
[19630.57s -> 19634.91s]  does like a really you'll do like the the slam this thing is awful to test
[19634.91s -> 19643.26s]  this on no huh become slam you dodged didn't dodge that you should have dodged
[19643.26s -> 19662.02s]  you okay hold on he sucks this guy sucks I'm asleep I've dude I've never seen
[19662.02s -> 19672.21s]  that status effect all right let's test it yeah we got to figure this out dude
[19672.21s -> 19676.14s]  there's no such thing as a dodge role in this game well does the other can we
[19676.18s -> 19685.69s]  do the other dodge where you just like the crouch weird dodge right no you you
[19685.69s -> 19699.00s]  should have that come on do this the thing you just did do it another move
[19699.00s -> 19707.83s]  all right you try it all right you die you duck under that but I couldn't duck
[19707.83s -> 19730.65s]  under it I I think I was just lucky cuz I did it if that's the timing all right
[19730.69s -> 19735.89s]  so wait a minute you mean to tell me if a five hours and 30 minutes we have not
[19735.89s -> 19739.37s]  been able to have i-frames when we thought we fixed a setting we just
[19739.37s -> 19755.26s]  haven't yeah yeah this is undodgeable I thought we fixed it oh I was everything
[19755.26s -> 19759.64s]  just felt so wrong everything is felt so off the whole time and it's because we
[19759.64s -> 19766.18s]  don't have a touch roll anymore we have to jump it all right we'll try that but
[19766.30s -> 19775.36s]  I know that there was something in this mod and it might I hate dude what that
[19775.36s -> 19781.42s]  might be it I remember that I think the classes have their own ways of dodging
[19781.42s -> 19791.29s]  oh did I get all the items I don't remember we don't have a class there's
[19791.29s -> 19804.95s]  one more spell here right isn't there one more spell I know I'm gonna look it
[19804.95s -> 19815.58s]  up you run around and vibe I think if you go up and then you go onto those
[19815.58s -> 19819.58s]  castle ramparts yeah you like jump on the castle then like bike invades you
[19819.58s -> 19836.04s]  and you can get something oh yeah I think it's because we have randomizer we
[19836.04s -> 19840.22s]  randomized the person in the tutorial right like we should have gotten
[19840.22s -> 19847.56s]  somebody that we also kind of have an issue with a d2 loot was overriding I'm
[19847.56s -> 19862.64s]  just all messed up oh yeah there is no bike that was the Giza guy that spell
[19862.68s -> 19874.09s]  isn't a dung beetle no it's not them it's not the mods fault it's we have
[19874.09s -> 19876.81s]  just a lot of shit turned on and I guess we didn't realize that we were
[19876.81s -> 19883.33s]  overriding stuff with other stuff that is really funny though that we've been
[19883.33s -> 19901.02s]  operating essentially without a dodge roll this whole time I mean there are a
[19901.02s -> 19905.94s]  lot of people saying that in the post that there's no iframes they're not
[19905.94s -> 19910.44s]  running any other mods and they don't know what the problem is but also we're
[19910.44s -> 19917.07s]  on an older version of the mod and I don't know that's it's alright it's fine
[19917.07s -> 19940.38s]  we're having fun oh no our modded sky room why the older version because the
[19940.38s -> 19946.18s]  older version stir correct me if I'm wrong but was compatible with d2 yeah
[19946.18s -> 19950.42s]  the d2 items have a compatibility patch and it only works with an older version
[19950.42s -> 19957.70s]  of reforged like these posts on the forum that are saying there's issues
[19957.70s -> 19964.11s]  with the iframes are from like very recently so I don't know I don't know if
[19964.11s -> 19970.08s]  we missed something in the the classes or but we kill things in two seconds
[19970.08s -> 19975.73s]  anyways it's like yeah it's not been that big of a problem surprisingly to
[19975.73s -> 19983.16s]  not have dodge roll I think we just have I expected it's been confusing a big
[19983.16s -> 19987.84s]  thing that the mod also does is it changes a lot of hitboxes on attacks so
[19988.32s -> 19993.36s]  the hitbox is exactly where the weapon is so it might feel like dodge rolls are
[19993.36s -> 19996.32s]  working because your character model is getting smaller and moving out of the
[19996.32s -> 20000.32s]  way of it hmm like what when a giant does like giant overhead slam on the
[20000.32s -> 20005.84s]  ground it's like a much smaller hitbox and your role is moving you so like
[20005.84s -> 20014.08s]  sometimes it's working which is why we probably haven't noticed it where's this
[20014.08s -> 20017.32s]  this one more spell somebody said it's outside there's like a pack of rats
[20017.32s -> 20027.91s]  not further away honestly if you want to play reforge just play reforge it
[20027.91s -> 20032.48s]  doesn't mix well with other mods stuff breaks you should do randomizer plus DSL
[20032.48s -> 20038.55s]  only if you want to play reforge do that on its own pretty balanced take on it I
[20038.55s -> 20042.71s]  think yeah we were really close to doing one or the other before the stream
[20042.71s -> 20047.32s]  started and then someone had some advice to get them to work a bit better and it
[20047.32s -> 20051.34s]  seemed to be working pretty well they were just like we'd already spent a lot
[20051.34s -> 20061.89s]  of time on it okay let me remember I gotta find this where is this pack you
[20061.89s -> 20066.51s]  know what this says with this pack of rats is uphill the hill towards the
[20066.51s -> 20074.77s]  chapel but turn left and then find the dung beetle you mean like over here like
[20074.77s -> 20084.97s]  up this way up the hill like up here what's the item another frenzy spell
[20084.97s -> 20099.34s]  apparently like up here off this way okay well it was a fun attempt I mean
[20099.34s -> 20105.10s]  can't get everything to work perfectly every time I really haven't even been
[20105.10s -> 20110.30s]  rolling I've just been wild striking okay
[20110.30s -> 20129.15s]  wheezing through attacks so where is this other spell up here looking for a
[20129.15s -> 20137.08s]  pack of it's not gonna be rats it'll be something else in that little forest I
[20137.08s -> 20187.81s]  go over here is this supposed to be them I guess there's a lot of shit here oh my
[20187.81s -> 20196.51s]  god will you leave me the fuck alone Miyazaki grows in power where is the
[20196.79s -> 20205.22s]  it's like the little dung beetle there was there was one like up the path just
[20205.22s -> 20209.70s]  fucking tell if I swear to God it's the worst enemy in the whole game it just
[20209.70s -> 20221.36s]  teleports okay we're looking for a dung beetle wait you mean that I wish I
[20221.36s -> 20226.00s]  could even look over here I wish I could walk over here and attack but I can't
[20226.00s -> 20232.95s]  you need a hand I'm the kind of looking but you're you're having some issues
[20232.95s -> 20236.19s]  it's hard people saying look look it's hard to look where there's a million
[20236.19s -> 20239.99s]  fucking things shooting and fighting and teleporting on you look at this guy
[20239.99s -> 20246.54s]  teleporting this instant transmission it's d-spawn good I don't even care
[20246.54s -> 20254.69s]  just dot just I frame dodge it just oh my god are you you're not joking I told
[20254.69s -> 20261.09s]  you you can't dodge it and you can't get away from them you can wild strike it
[20261.09s -> 20274.36s]  refuse to get off the horse yeah I don't want to get off the horse because there's
[20274.36s -> 20287.54s]  no I freight there's no dodging I think what it killed me in two seconds I don't
[20287.58s -> 20301.63s]  have wild strikes like he does I think the thing despawned what thing I was
[20301.63s -> 20304.79s]  looking for a dung beetle is apparently something over there yeah I think there
[20304.79s -> 20320.34s]  were dung beetles and then we startled with them yes the beetle ran away when
[20320.34s -> 20334.54s]  you started getting attacked why it's hard to run after it we'll never know
[20334.54s -> 20338.54s]  alright so what do you want to do do you want to do you want to keep playing this
[20338.54s -> 20341.70s]  or do you want to like fix this and try it again some other time or what do you
[20341.90s -> 20348.64s]  what do you what do you want to do I would rather play it correctly I don't
[20348.64s -> 20352.56s]  want to have no I don't want to have no dodge roll the whole time we play this
[20352.56s -> 20362.54s]  then in that case I mean at that point when we have to make new characters
[20362.54s -> 20369.89s]  completely oh shit to like start the game with the proper stuff we were
[20369.89s -> 20377.26s]  supposed to have and then I think at that point like we probably have to ditch
[20377.26s -> 20386.34s]  I guess we'd just be ditching randomizer and then Diablo 2 loot would stay so we
[20386.34s -> 20393.74s]  wouldn't have to restart we would just have to turn off randomizer well how
[20393.74s -> 20398.10s]  about this how about we let's restore the vibes let's go kill something fun and
[20398.10s -> 20404.89s]  then we will maybe we'll try to get another time okay we have to restore the
[20404.89s -> 20408.17s]  vibes though we have to kill have to restore the vibes they have to be
[20408.17s -> 20418.10s]  restored where is the most convenient to fight major boss that we have not done
[20418.10s -> 20430.07s]  I mean we could just we do but we did Godric could run through the castle of
[20430.07s -> 20436.97s]  Lucaria I just sprint through the castle is it easier to sprint oh carry a
[20436.97s -> 20441.26s]  manner if we just ran to where Laura it is yeah let's do that let's get the
[20441.26s -> 20466.77s]  vibes back we have to get them back I tried to click it didn't work reforged
[20466.77s -> 20483.74s]  adds secure style timed blocks it does stirs you know that no here let me read
[20483.78s -> 20489.00s]  you a couple of important things we're playing this we're playing this
[20489.00s -> 20494.24s]  completely wrong for almost six hours removed the instant input buffer for
[20494.24s -> 20500.27s]  roles on most player stagger animations that's why we're like I think it was
[20500.27s -> 20520.06s]  more that the rules don't have I frames where I'm looking at the defects are a
[20520.06s -> 20525.72s]  powerful time blocks they give more skill and power to blocking holy shit
[20526.00s -> 20531.27s]  all right we got to restore these vibes man I'm there hanging by a thread right
[20531.27s -> 20550.67s]  now I need him restored didn't read well I didn't hold up hold up hold up I got
[20550.67s -> 20554.39s]  it I'm telling you I've read a lot of it I didn't read very specifically dodge
[20554.39s -> 20559.19s]  roll the whole mechanic of all souls games we thought like we could do it
[20559.19s -> 20568.14s]  better the hubris blocking updated let me find the important bits we're gonna
[20568.26s -> 20578.30s]  get these vibes back man we're gonna kill something you recover from block
[20578.30s -> 20581.42s]  animations a lot quicker so you can act more quickly out of them deflect
[20581.42s -> 20584.82s]  blocking an enemy attack within the first few frames of a weapons block
[20584.82s -> 20594.21s]  animation will perform a deflect is this walking in are we just drinking though
[20594.21s -> 20598.65s]  the copium or are we just bad like is there actually no I frames or are we
[20598.65s -> 20602.97s]  just awful like I don't think we're bad because we I need to haven't we haven't
[20602.97s -> 20616.91s]  been I need to know we've been doing fine yeah this page doesn't say anything
[20616.91s -> 20621.51s]  about dodge rolls it just says there is a there is a timed block mechanic and
[20621.51s -> 20629.06s]  then everything else all right well we're gonna restore the vibes we're
[20629.06s -> 20634.02s]  gonna kill a boss we're gonna say nice and then maybe we'll figure it out we'll
[20634.02s -> 20638.26s]  come back and try it again with the vibes restored which I don't I mean I
[20638.26s -> 20658.06s]  don't know we'll see we'll see okay teleporting to where let's do oh we're
[20658.06s -> 20669.31s]  gonna do carry a manner yes we didn't delete the right files for randomizer
[20669.31s -> 20679.14s]  compatibility hey sometimes you try to do a bunch of mods and it goes great
[20679.14s -> 20686.10s]  sometimes you do a bunch of mods and you can no longer I frame hey that's just
[20686.10s -> 20695.93s]  the way it is let me try one thing real quick we want to give me a second I got
[20695.93s -> 20701.56s]  to get my like cheat sheet open of what the menus do again I don't know where
[20701.56s -> 20719.01s]  they went I sit here at bonfire are we gonna change like a setting yeah top one
[20719.01s -> 20726.89s]  event text huh so one was saying this earlier actually this might be what it
[20726.89s -> 20731.25s]  was normal mode is supposed to have normal dodge rolls but I crashed earlier
[20731.25s -> 20737.42s]  and when I came back there's a possibility that it reverted so we did
[20737.42s -> 20743.59s]  the top one down to down to you know no no no wait okay reset Reese I lost my
[20743.59s -> 20751.82s]  train of thought go way back to the beginning okay top one top one okay two
[20751.82s -> 20769.09s]  down yeah that's such a jump scare so what did that what did that do that set
[20769.09s -> 20776.17s]  it to normal Elden ring difficulty which does by default normal difficulty mode
[20776.17s -> 20780.94s]  is enabled this difficulty mode well I don't the other difficulties like the
[20780.94s -> 20784.06s]  higher and weirder difficulties start changing how many I frames you have on
[20784.06s -> 20793.37s]  dodges all right well let's go kill a boss and I might have accidentally turned
[20793.37s -> 20807.75s]  one of them on earlier and game crashing might have brought it back okay how you
[20807.75s -> 20813.23s]  doing I have one more thing I wanted to get to the bottom this before the stream
[20813.23s -> 20820.79s]  ends there do you want to go or do you want it all right exit let's go I'm
[20820.79s -> 20830.20s]  sorry sit in the theme I'm sitting down I'm getting the picture picture yeah I'm
[20830.24s -> 20838.44s]  getting the picture because we definitely accidentally goofed around
[20838.44s -> 20842.48s]  with these and killed ourselves a few times which many did we activate it
[20842.48s -> 20871.71s]  something we shouldn't know god damn it you good I'm sorry I'm transcribing top
[20871.71s -> 20881.42s]  one bottom one okay for every single one of these yeah open them and then choose
[20881.42s -> 20889.00s]  no choose no yeah it's turning all of the special weirdo options off if any of
[20889.00s -> 20896.68s]  them were accidentally on because some of these there's like a sure a mode and
[20896.68s -> 20902.89s]  it's like hey this decreases I frames by like half and it's hard mode okay so
[20902.89s -> 20910.27s]  like some of them might have been on oh shit okay okay let's go
[20910.27s -> 20920.16s]  you're all showing up like that for chat because of how many mods are enabled

[21910.54s -> 21916.84s]  and but I can look over at the OBS preview and see you fighting well you
[21917.24s -> 21934.26s]  say how do you dodge fire is what they say it's all right there was worth an
[21934.26s -> 21943.21s]  attempt worth it was look I had fun I had fun hey when you install a bunch of
[21943.21s -> 21946.61s]  random mods and you get in and sometimes sometimes it don't work well together
[21946.61s -> 21950.25s]  sometimes they get screwed up sometimes there's no tutorial because we broke it
[21950.25s -> 21956.14s]  by deleting the tutorial by having something happen in the randomizer and
[21956.14s -> 21960.58s]  then we just you know the vibes get a little fucked up start sometimes
[21960.58s -> 21974.32s]  sometimes sometimes I've got this don't even worry about it five and a half
[21974.32s -> 21978.34s]  hours went by and you didn't notice oh no we did I just think that we but I
[21978.34s -> 21985.73s]  think we both thought it was so used to being gaslit that like I brought it up
[21985.73s -> 21989.09s]  at least a dozen times and we were just like no wait maybe I just like stink at
[21989.09s -> 22008.83s]  this game yeah I just honestly I had fun it was fun it was worth doing I think
[22008.83s -> 22015.52s]  it was worth it yeah we got to the point where I think
[22015.52s -> 22019.63s]  once you get past early game you need to start being able to dodge things well
[22019.63s -> 22028.56s]  I'm sorry it's all good it was definitely worth doing hey seamless co-op mod
[22028.56s -> 22035.30s]  works pretty flawlessly didn't yeah vibes and toilet vibes but you know
[22035.30s -> 22038.42s]  whatever it's all right they all you look sometimes you get toilet vibes but
[22038.42s -> 22044.71s]  we're good everything's are you good how do you feel you feel I'm good yeah we're
[22044.71s -> 22055.02s]  good everything's fine I mean we had just played like it was definitely worth
[22055.02s -> 22058.58s]  how many hours of Elden ring though the week prior I just want more Elden ring
[22058.58s -> 22063.38s]  well we but like we already did so much you know so we did some new stuff and I
[22063.38s -> 22066.78s]  like I had fun because I wanted to play more Elden ring I don't think there's a
[22066.78s -> 22070.97s]  problem with that there's no problem with that but it's bedtime it's like
[22070.97s -> 22076.19s]  almost 2 a.m. here so it is either way thanks sir thanks for playing good to see you
[22076.19s -> 22079.43s]  yep I'm sure I'll see you again soon have a great night thank you for hanging
[22079.43s -> 22086.74s]  out take care see you soon dude yeah yeah yeah that was stir and that was Elden
[22086.74s -> 22106.14s]  ring and that was mods seamless co-op for Skyrim would be phenomenal maybe hey
[22106.14s -> 22110.49s]  we were just checking it out we did have okay we're coming off you're gonna
[22110.49s -> 22115.97s]  remember we're coming off like the ultimate high of last week playing and
[22115.97s -> 22119.87s]  becoming Elden Lord that's just like you know let's just put some more stuff on
[22119.87s -> 22123.94s]  and see what happens the vibes got a little fucked up that we know whatever
[22123.94s -> 22135.24s]  that's all good is your PC okay yeah I can change scenes it's just Elden ring
[22135.24s -> 22145.31s]  is just not on my monitor just like not here I can change scenes in OBS maybe
[22145.31s -> 22151.02s]  try something like randomizer and double bosses or something hmm you're making it
[22151.02s -> 22157.83s]  you're making it sound bad no no no no no no I had a good time all that matters
[22157.83s -> 22167.23s]  is me and start talking about like fucking bugs and stuff who cares thanks
[22167.23s -> 22175.42s]  for sticking around regardless the next time you see me will be on Wednesday and
[22175.42s -> 22189.18s]  Wednesday we are going to do hmm wouldn't you like to know we'll see I'll
[22189.18s -> 22196.54s]  figure out a game maybe maybe the hitman stuff kind of wanted to do it maybe the
[22196.54s -> 22205.79s]  hitman stuff if not that then we'll see that'll be a decision for Tuesday night
[22211.02s -> 22215.41s]  oh let me say this too I said that worst dream of the year is not going to be a
[22215.41s -> 22220.74s]  category this year I said that specifically because it's kind of to
[22220.74s -> 22225.04s]  prevent because I know I told you guys that a lot of the streams this year are
[22225.04s -> 22230.12s]  gonna be more chill slowed down a lot and it's kind of a way to prevent people
[22230.12s -> 22234.32s]  to come into like a chill stream and go oh this is boring worst dream of the
[22234.32s -> 22239.64s]  year 2023 right because I feel like that's definitely possible because if
[22239.64s -> 22244.44s]  if I'm gonna be doing more just chill kind of slower streams then I think it
[22244.48s -> 22251.78s]  kind of takes takes that out of the equation because otherwise it would be
[22251.78s -> 22256.30s]  like looking over here at the pit cross again got a lot of fucking nominations
[22256.30s -> 22265.04s]  for that category this year so I don't think I think I'd rather just not have
[22265.04s -> 22278.42s]  it be there otherwise it might be a large category yeah thanks for watching
[22278.42s -> 22286.26s]  Ellen ring with stir stir is awesome give it up for stir take care of
[22286.26s -> 22295.86s]  yourselves have a great night see you Wednesday Wednesday you know the time 6
[22295.86s -> 22312.32s]  p.m. Pacific you have an email you if you if anybody needs to wants to contact
[22312.32s -> 22317.28s]  me for any it's for business purposes I don't believe yeah it's the evolved one
[22317.28s -> 22328.72s]  the evolved email that's on my Twitter is but that's for business stuff though
[22328.72s -> 22334.00s]  if you like send a message of this it's probably not gonna get um about my get
[22334.00s -> 22338.80s]  filtered or something it's mostly for business stuff but I don't really do
