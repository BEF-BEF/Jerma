[1.59s -> 7.75s]  Ooh, Deltarune. I got my Deltarune hat on, my Deltarune shirt on, my Deltarune clothes on, my Deltarune everything.
[10.55s -> 25.42s]  I've got my Deltarune plushies back here. I'm wearing a Star Wars t-shirt. Uh, never mind. I got a tweet. I'll be right back.
[25.66s -> 71.48s]  How you doing? See you in a minute. Okay. So I want to make this really clear.
[71.56s -> 77.86s]  This is going to be, uh, for those of you that haven't played Deltarune chapter one, uh, this is gonna be a spoiler free playthrough.
[78.58s -> 82.34s]  I can respect the people that haven't done it yet. All names will be censored.
[83.30s -> 89.74s]  All text will be censored. And anytime there's a major, major event on the screen, I'm going to cut to, uh, to auto.
[91.26s -> 93.42s]  So I'm just, I want to, you know, make sure you guys understand.
[97.46s -> 101.34s]  Now I'm ready to go. I did run up here though. I'm a little winded.
[104.54s -> 108.62s]  I always open up. So I'm on my phone. I'll just take a look at the, uh,
[109.98s -> 111.90s]  the clock app.
[111.90s -> 114.52s]  And the second hand is on the six.
[115.16s -> 117.16s]  And it's just going around and I know that it's almost two.
[118.18s -> 120.34s]  And I go, oh fuck, I got to get up in that room.
[121.85s -> 126.97s]  And turn the stream on before the second hand hits the 12 up there.
[128.50s -> 132.28s]  I almost made it.
[132.28s -> 133.40s]  Very close.
[133.40s -> 142.36s]  You know, your house has two floors.
[142.44s -> 143.40s]  Five.
[143.40s -> 153.10s]  What are you talking about? It takes me about four minutes to run up and down the stairs.
[157.45s -> 161.45s]  No, I don't live in a five story house. I would never want to live in a five story house.
[163.48s -> 169.08s]  Have I talked about my like anxiety with living in a big house or a bigger place? It's scary. I hate it.
[170.95s -> 173.05s]  The bigger your house is,
[173.37s -> 178.41s]  the more places for a murderer to come in and like hide in your eighth bedroom
[179.05s -> 181.05s]  while you're brushing your teeth in bedroom two.
[181.45s -> 184.57s]  And you might not even fucking hear them come in. Nope. No, thanks.
[186.30s -> 188.54s]  I want to be able to be completely aware
[189.62s -> 192.74s]  of every single space in my place of residence.
[194.20s -> 196.20s]  If somebody's scratching at the door
[197.62s -> 199.78s]  20 feet away, I want to be able to fucking hear it.
[201.24s -> 203.64s]  I'm not going to be in living room four
[205.21s -> 207.21s]  and not know what's going on in living room two.
[216.02s -> 219.19s]  Paranoid. That's fine. That's all right.
[224.50s -> 226.50s]  Just set up baby monitors everywhere.
[226.74s -> 231.10s]  I don't know. I don't want to play five nights at Freddy's in my own house.
[232.26s -> 236.36s]  No, I don't want to do that.
[236.36s -> 241.08s]  That's when fucking chicken's gonna jump out of my face. I don't want to do that.
[244.42s -> 247.94s]  No, I want to be very aware of my surroundings at all times.
[251.70s -> 253.70s]  Live in a four by four house.
[255.99s -> 257.99s]  Aren't you scared of ovens too?
[258.84s -> 260.84s]  I'm not scared of ovens.
[260.84s -> 262.84s]  I'm scared of how ovens operate.
[264.50s -> 266.02s]  It's weird.
[266.02s -> 268.02s]  Something about it just freaks me out. I don't know why.
[271.45s -> 273.45s]  The fact that there is a box in your house
[274.46s -> 276.54s]  that heats up to hundreds of degrees
[277.50s -> 279.98s]  with gas.
[279.98s -> 283.66s]  It's just I don't know if something about it irrationally is uncomfortable to me.
[285.06s -> 286.34s]  I don't know why.
[286.34s -> 294.52s]  That's a recycled bit.
[294.52s -> 296.52s]  No, no, these are not recycled bits.
[296.60s -> 298.60s]  Hey, I can recycle a bit
[299.00s -> 303.16s]  when there's way more people that are here than last time I talked about the oven routine, okay?
[305.14s -> 307.54s]  Two years ago when I talked about my fear of ovens
[308.42s -> 311.62s]  like 4000 of you weren't here. So I get to do it again.
[312.66s -> 316.90s]  Every additional viewer that's added to this stream I get to redo a joke because that person hasn't heard it yet.
[317.62s -> 324.97s]  That was a few months ago.
[325.13s -> 326.41s]  Never mind.
[326.41s -> 330.58s]  Oops.
[330.58s -> 333.06s]  You're environmentally conscious with your jokes.
[334.15s -> 339.38s]  I gotta I gotta keep my joke carbon footprint down.
[340.02s -> 347.90s]  That was definitely more than a few months ago. I don't know. I have no idea.
[350.33s -> 353.21s]  I wonder how many words I've said on stream and on YouTube.
[353.77s -> 357.18s]  How many actually single words have I spoken?
[358.62s -> 363.18s]  You have to be talking about like tens of millions hundreds of millions of words that have been spoken into a microphone.
[365.45s -> 367.77s]  I can't keep track of them all of everything I've ever said.
[368.49s -> 370.10s]  How am I supposed to do that?
[370.10s -> 372.10s]  The oven routine is a recycled bit.
[372.18s -> 374.18s]  Yeah, since the oven routine I have said
[375.68s -> 377.94s]  745 million words.
[379.00s -> 381.05s]  Think about that.
[381.05s -> 383.05s]  Really think think about that for a second.
[383.37s -> 387.32s]  Important.
[387.32s -> 393.75s]  Somebody has to count it. I don't I hope nobody does do that. That's way that's way too much work for something.
[393.83s -> 395.83s]  So that is not important at all.
[399.38s -> 401.38s]  You see half of your words are filler.
[402.87s -> 406.07s]  Yeah, because I have so much to say that I need my brain has to catch up for a second.
[408.07s -> 410.79s]  My left hemisphere and my right hemisphere are the tortoise and the hare.
[411.43s -> 416.23s]  And they're both they're both competing at the same time.
[416.55s -> 419.83s]  Like one of them runs real fast and the other one takes like 20 minutes to get there.
[420.47s -> 426.42s]  Play the game. It's been seven minutes. We'll just I'm
[427.22s -> 432.70s]  Get out of here.
[432.70s -> 436.54s]  Play the game. I'm gonna play the game. I'm I'm excited about this one.
[441.14s -> 443.14s]  Impatient Andy.
[443.14s -> 445.14s]  Yeah, just we'll just chill. We're just hanging out.
[448.47s -> 451.50s]  Vod watchers skip.
[451.50s -> 455.58s]  Well, that's the that's the privilege of being a Vod watcher versus a live viewer.
[456.22s -> 460.65s]  A Vod watcher right now was able to go like this.
[461.53s -> 464.09s]  I put oven pipe.
[465.61s -> 468.17s]  Okay, so we're gonna play Deltarune now. Uh, we're gonna start the game now.
[468.89s -> 470.90s]  But you guys are here live.
[470.90s -> 473.22s]  You have to you have to put up with me in real time.
[475.21s -> 477.91s]  So I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.
[478.55s -> 490.98s]  I've been waiting for this. Yeah, I've I'm excited. I did my refresher course.
[493.22s -> 495.22s]  I remember everything pretty much.
[496.92s -> 499.16s]  I've seen everything I need to see.
[499.16s -> 502.44s]  I am refreshed for Deltarune chapter two, by the way, this is chapter two.
[502.44s -> 507.11s]  So if you don't know what this is, I don't know if you want to be here, but maybe you do.
[511.58s -> 513.64s]  You say wait, what is it?
[513.64s -> 516.60s]  You say one to seven words per second.
[517.08s -> 519.88s]  So that's six thousand one hundred and twenty words per hour.
[521.99s -> 523.42s]  Okay.
[523.42s -> 526.14s]  So for six hundred so six thousand one hundred and twenty words an hour.
[527.02s -> 528.30s]  times
[528.30s -> 532.66s]  like five hours.
[532.66s -> 536.02s]  Talking about like what? Thirty to forty thousand words, uh said.
[537.06s -> 540.02s]  On stream per stream times one thousand.
[540.74s -> 547.08s]  Is like three hundred and fifty million words or something. I don't know. Somebody will figure it out.
[548.66s -> 552.58s]  I say way more than one or two set. No way. I say way more than that.
[553.14s -> 557.69s]  All right, you guys ready for Deltarune chapter two?
[562.36s -> 566.68s]  You know, i'm fucked up now. Now i'm going to try to say more words a second to like bump my
[567.56s -> 568.76s]  score.
[568.76s -> 577.32s]  Where's my audio? Where's my audio?
[577.64s -> 581.58s]  All right, so I played this on different computers. So I on my
[582.30s -> 585.18s]  streaming setup is not I don't have the old files.
[585.66s -> 587.66s]  I'll just pretend like it's the same file.
[587.82s -> 591.26s]  But I heard I've I've everything I said you don't have to be playing in the same file. It's fine.
[591.90s -> 597.32s]  He's muted.
[597.32s -> 603.43s]  How does this work? Where's my audio? Oh shit. That's why.
[608.76s -> 610.20s]  He didn't kill.
[610.20s -> 614.36s]  Wait, hold on. Make sure everyone who cares? You're episode two. I can say it. Okay.
[615.80s -> 617.80s]  Why am I so concerned about saying this?
[620.50s -> 622.50s]  This is you're here at episode two.
[623.75s -> 627.59s]  I have to imply that you've seen episode one or played episode one, right?
[627.67s -> 629.91s]  Like what am I talking about? And this has been out for a week.
[630.31s -> 633.75s]  I'm always the last person on Twitch to play these games. The new ones that come out.
[634.15s -> 637.56s]  So I didn't play I didn't beat Jevil on this save file.
[641.40s -> 642.28s]  Oh, well.
[642.28s -> 652.49s]  I mean I if you didn't if you don't know I'm I'm one of I think of of six people on Twitch.
[653.05s -> 655.29s]  Or maybe six people in the world
[655.29s -> 661.85s]  that beat Jevil on their first try. First try. No bullshit. Did it first try with nothing. No bullshit.
[662.01s -> 664.49s]  I'm one of six people on in I think in North America.
[665.13s -> 668.02s]  From my understanding.
[668.02s -> 676.10s]  Stream is ruined.
[676.10s -> 677.94s]  No spoilers.
[677.94s -> 679.94s]  All right, let's go. Let's go. I'm ready.

[696.28s -> 699.45s]  I made this was my name.
[699.45s -> 701.85s]  That's such an old joke though. That's so old.

[972.18s -> 992.36s]  Is this a unreleased game fortnight? There's no time to read books just generally. Yeah
[993.69s -> 995.69s]  That's like really that's a good point
[996.46s -> 1001.06s]  How to draw dragons is at the bottom of the drawer the purple character on the cover is dressed

[1169.80s -> 1171.80s]  Times are pretty good times are pretty bad
[1172.60s -> 1179.36s]  Mediocre times iffy times so so times listening to this your eyes begin to close automatically

[1238.48s -> 1245.04s]  You're an e-clown and you have three voices when you come in for a checkup at the doctor's appointment
[1245.72s -> 1252.28s]  I don't stick the thing up your nose and then tell you to leave and then say you have nose hairs
[1252.99s -> 1262.54s]  I got i've got like 10 things I can diagnose on you. Actually they do
[1264.43s -> 1267.07s]  Wait, i'm supposed to be the reverse. Fuck. I fucked it up
[1267.71s -> 1272.51s]  Specialists are doctors that like there's a nose doctor, right? And all he does is look at your nose
[1272.83s -> 1277.28s]  I said it completely backwards. It was completely backwards. I meant it the other way. I've ruined everything
[1277.44s -> 1283.32s]  I actually meant to say it the other way if there's a nose doctor that looks only at your nose
[1283.40s -> 1286.84s]  So if the if you only do the nose doctor routine, it's fine
[1288.00s -> 1293.28s]  So if I can do one two three voices really good, that's fine because I can do them really good

[1754.69s -> 1759.20s]  Right all like the dumb things that I say is the hair running as fast as he can
[1759.68s -> 1766.02s]  The tortoise needs like extra time to even process what's happening on the screen. They're constantly in
[1766.82s -> 1772.85s]  Conflict with each other. They got the junk off the floor or doesn't do a giant dusty ball
[1773.25s -> 1783.04s]  What's in here managed to cram everything into the closet even the rug
[1786.46s -> 1790.98s]  Rockboard door is locked. What am I talking about? Well, you weren't here
[1791.22s -> 1791.46s]  Okay

[1838.82s -> 1840.51s]  gone
[1840.51s -> 1844.35s]  Right when chris sealed the fountain that dark world disappeared
[1845.15s -> 1847.15s]  And turned back into a normal classroom
[1849.15s -> 1851.58s]  Where's lancer gonna live now?
[1851.58s -> 1853.10s]  Don't worry, susie

[1864.21s -> 1866.77s]  ralsleys
[1867.49s -> 1870.69s]  As you bring dark world denizens back here
[1871.41s -> 1874.53s]  Power of our fountain will transform this town more and more
[1876.24s -> 1878.24s]  From now on the enemies we spare
[1878.80s -> 1880.80s]  Will be recruited to our town
[1881.28s -> 1884.80s]  So let's keep sparing enemies. Okay?
[1884.96s -> 1887.71s]  Anyhow, why don't we all have a look around
[1888.19s -> 1891.71s]  We can head north towards the castle. I have a special surprise to show you there
[1893.87s -> 1895.87s]  Not if I surprised myself first
[1896.51s -> 1898.51s]  Last one there is a fresh and fragrant egg
[1899.23s -> 1904.54s]  Come on chris. You're gonna let him beat us
[1910.34s -> 1912.96s]  Beat us. I thought you were racing
[1913.84s -> 1915.84s]  Yeah, I want to be the egg

[1944.06s -> 1946.06s]  Recruits will appear in your town
[1946.14s -> 1952.08s]  Wonder what happens if you get them all you can check the area's recruit status at save points certain bosses are excluded
[1952.40s -> 1960.26s]  Okay, interesting. Can I go on the cafe?
[1966.30s -> 1970.78s]  Mama amoeba I wanted to run the bakery but someone is already working there
[1971.42s -> 1973.66s]  A cafe that serves pastries. What a disgrace
[1974.30s -> 1976.70s]  What sort of humiliating thing will happen next
[1978.61s -> 1994.27s]  Check recruits a real dust bunny known to play dirty, but loves to play clean dislikes vacuums likes dusty places

[3826.88s -> 3835.09s]  I heard a dog was doing donuts so I sped over here
[3835.33s -> 3839.70s]  But I just learned donuts is actually the name of a special attack for cars
[3840.10s -> 3847.97s]  Is my life stuck in a loop of doughy disappointment graphics moving at a snail's pace?
[3848.45s -> 3865.55s]  I love snails today get any better looks like a car looks like a car. Well, I can't go anywhere. All right, we're here

[3895.84s -> 3898.29s]  huh
[3898.29s -> 3904.22s]  It's like the inside of the closet chris. You don't think this could be
[3908.16s -> 3913.28s]  Another dark world. Well
[3913.84s -> 3915.84s]  I guess this means we can't start our project
[3917.58s -> 3921.42s]  Unless you know chris if there's a dark fountain in there
[3921.98s -> 3923.73s]  You can seal it
[3923.73s -> 3925.73s]  It'll turn back into the computer lab, right?
[3927.31s -> 3929.31s]  So what's it gonna be chris?
[3930.66s -> 3933.86s]  Let's go. Let's go. We can just use the computer in my house

[3980.18s -> 3982.18s]  Our last adventure was great, right?
[3982.26s -> 3988.53s]  I couldn't stop thinking about having another
[3988.77s -> 3993.06s]  I don't know what's in there, but
[3993.71s -> 3995.95s]  Can't live if we don't find out right?
[3996.83s -> 4005.57s]  Come on chris
[4005.57s -> 4008.13s]  So is this gonna be the same place or is it gonna be like a different?

[4159.74s -> 4162.06s]  Well, look queen. We're not children

[4192.42s -> 4194.67s]  Why the capturing?
[4194.67s -> 4197.23s]  So that she may become my willing peon
[4198.45s -> 4200.45s]  In my quest for world domination
[4201.31s -> 4205.15s]  Also, maybe I will make her face into a robot one. I who knows I could
[4206.53s -> 4208.32s]  Wait, why?
[4208.32s -> 4211.01s]  Seems cool
[4211.01s -> 4212.61s]  Well, forget it, dude
[4212.61s -> 4215.26s]  Nobody's turning anyone's face into a robot
[4216.59s -> 4219.81s]  Could that be a statement of animus dissension?
[4220.77s -> 4222.29s]  Huh?

[4877.34s -> 4879.66s]  Lost enemies can't become recruits ever again
[4880.38s -> 4883.14s]  The bonds you break may make you stronger

[5054.56s -> 5057.68s]  Recently something called internet is having an outage
[5058.70s -> 5061.18s]  Some say it was the secret to queen's know-how

[7549.54s -> 7553.62s]  Right, that's way too long. I did it for like two or three straight minutes
[7559.54s -> 7565.17s]  That's I got my I got my laugh track ready
[7565.89s -> 7569.97s]  No, hold on. It's got to be better. Like you guys got to get if we got this is gonna be accurate
[7570.53s -> 7572.53s]  So we got two that are fine, right?
[7577.17s -> 7579.17s]  All right, so that that one's a good one
[7579.25s -> 7581.49s]  So we'll we have to have a really really like
[7582.21s -> 7584.38s]  a really like angry one
[7595.87s -> 7598.83s]  That's good and this one now that's bad this one is good
[7600.83s -> 7605.09s]  No, no, no, I got better this is good
[7611.76s -> 7616.54s]  So now if I see a bunch of minus twos, I know what to press and I see a lot of plus twos
[7616.54s -> 7618.54s]  I know what to press
[7619.34s -> 7622.88s]  And this is if you don't like if you don't think it's funny
[7626.82s -> 7637.04s]  Okay, play the game. All right. Yeah. Yeah, we got okay. All right, right, right. It's monkey friday. That's enough
[7637.76s -> 7639.36s]  Okay, let's go
[7639.36s -> 7644.22s]  Okay about yourselves
[7644.22s -> 7647.26s]  I'm sweet. The ladies call me captain kk
[7651.73s -> 7653.73s]  We used to work the sound in this town
[7654.13s -> 7656.26s]  Until queen came around
[7656.26s -> 7660.54s]  Kk is short for cakes
[7660.62s -> 7664.22s]  She made music against the law unless you make a song she likes
[7665.18s -> 7673.42s]  But the only junk she enjoys are reverse disc tracks where the vocalist puts themselves down and praises the queen
[7678.38s -> 7680.38s]  Or noise music
[7680.38s -> 7683.49s]  But even if queenie tries to put a limiter on us
[7684.29s -> 7686.29s]  You can't stop the music
[7686.61s -> 7689.73s]  Hear that we'll just go underground crash boom bang
[7690.53s -> 7694.93s]  That's why we made this junk shop. We'll fund our musical rebellion
[7695.41s -> 7697.41s]  Can we make noise music too?
[7697.89s -> 7703.90s]  Okay performance you want to see what we got?
[7704.70s -> 7707.02s]  Can you handle this hold on to your antennas?
[7711.50s -> 7713.50s]  How is that how is that?
[7717.74s -> 7723.01s]  That was good all our songs are only four seconds long
[7725.60s -> 7731.33s]  Okay, a queen wasn't always so harsh
[7732.21s -> 7734.93s]  No, she was she just got worse somehow
[7735.57s -> 7739.87s]  It wasn't until that dark fountain showed up she started going into overdrive
[7742.58s -> 7744.58s]  Night this night that fountain that
[7745.14s -> 7749.38s]  Like what does that night even have going for it that I can't that I don't come on gwen
[7752.05s -> 7754.05s]  zoomer tiktok musicians
[7754.69s -> 7763.30s]  But like I said, she wasn't always so bad. She used to give me sweets for being so sweet
[7764.18s -> 7765.94s]  Oh, I never got candy
[7765.94s -> 7770.80s]  He kept calling her a hot mama cap
[7771.84s -> 7774.72s]  Yeah, is that wrong? She looks like a mom and tends to overheat
[7776.21s -> 7778.85s]  KK help me out here. Oh, what do you think me?
[7779.81s -> 7781.49s]  I like candy
[7781.49s -> 7785.17s]  Yeah, you're right. KK. We got to focus on what's important if the band fights we'll get out of tune
[7785.89s -> 7787.89s]  And we have any lemon drops
[7787.97s -> 7795.06s]  Junk work our main gig is making scrap into machines. Our clients are sometimes a bit off key though
[7795.62s -> 7797.62s]  They smell off key, too
[7797.86s -> 7799.86s]  Like some little weird guy
[7800.02s -> 7802.02s]  He wanted us to sneak into queen's mansion
[7802.90s -> 7804.90s]  We're just rebels. We don't want to get in trouble
[7806.66s -> 7808.66s]  Recently, we got a real high class client
[7809.06s -> 7812.82s]  A man of taste he had a way with words. I couldn't even understand him
[7812.82s -> 7815.14s]  I blew my voice out doing the fucking chimpanzee shit
[7816.34s -> 7818.34s]  Like I it's gone
[7818.34s -> 7821.57s]  I'm only two hours in
[7821.57s -> 7825.33s]  Now all we got to do is follow the blueprints, right? It'll be our big time break
[7826.37s -> 7828.45s]  Yeah, haha. It's gonna break apart big time

[7855.17s -> 7858.29s]  Did I even buy the weapons? Is there even a reason to buy them?
[7859.17s -> 7861.47s]  If I don't plan on swinging the sword once
[7861.95s -> 7864.96s]  There's no point, right?
[7865.36s -> 7869.87s]  Okay, well I

[8544.90s -> 8549.01s]  Is gross
[8549.01s -> 8555.59s]  That's what we say ambrosia is what is it's like chunks of marshmallow and like potato salad

[8612.37s -> 8614.37s]  I'll take that whipped cream out of the can
[8616.00s -> 8618.00s]  Mini marshmallows and fruits
[8619.48s -> 8621.08s]  It's as if

[8897.42s -> 8898.86s]  a plus
[8898.86s -> 8903.59s]  What the fuck is going on in this game?
[8904.23s -> 8906.31s]  Are they talking about studying in class that we're in?

[9012.76s -> 9014.76s]  This roller coaster
[9015.64s -> 9017.72s]  It's not actually finished yet
[9018.68s -> 9020.60s]  What does that mean?
[9020.60s -> 9022.60s]  a pain
[9037.24s -> 9042.62s]  Looks like this trash saved us
[9043.98s -> 9051.88s]  Come on. Oh who's king of the trash pile now?
[9056.78s -> 9060.32s]  Good reflexes there good reflexes very good reflexes
[9062.46s -> 9065.64s]  Susie are you all right?
[9066.44s -> 9069.26s]  It's nothing I just
[9069.98s -> 9073.30s]  Oh, ow
[9073.38s -> 9075.62s]  Sure, you don't want me to look

[9084.44s -> 9089.75s]  What are you doing feel better
[9090.79s -> 9095.11s]  Feel better after you just came up and I acting the acting
[9095.83s -> 9106.47s]  Um, it doesn't feel worse, I guess how do you do that anyway?
[9108.39s -> 9110.39s]  And healing thingy
[9110.79s -> 9112.79s]  Oh healing magic. It's simple. Uh
[9113.19s -> 9117.98s]  Susie anyone can do it. I could even teach you if you're interested
[9119.74s -> 9122.38s]  Ask me again when it's like blood explosion magic
[9126.86s -> 9132.54s]  But if you wanted I guess I could learn it and you wouldn't you know have to annoy me with it anymore
[9133.18s -> 9134.38s]  uh
[9134.38s -> 9135.98s]  Sure susie
[9135.98s -> 9137.98s]  Next time we have a break
[9138.78s -> 9143.38s]  Just go already chris
[9143.38s -> 9145.40s]  There's like an oscar the grouch in here
[9145.40s -> 9149.96s]  You dug through the trash and found a dark candy our candy was added to your items. Nice
[9150.52s -> 9157.56s]  It's a trash bag that looks like an eggplant. I was gonna say cash register
[9158.12s -> 9172.28s]  Okay
[9172.28s -> 9174.92s]  Oh, i'm trying to figure out got it
[9176.98s -> 9178.98s]  Oh boy. Oh boy. I'm trashy
[9179.78s -> 9181.94s]  Is it all about adjusting your inventory?
[9182.95s -> 9185.43s]  Trash cans like me can hold all sorts of things
[9186.58s -> 9189.78s]  Just like your storage if you get more than 12 items
[9193.26s -> 9195.26s]  Uh, yeah, not now, dude
[9196.20s -> 9199.02s]  It's sort of an emotional moment
[9199.10s -> 9201.10s]  Oh, oh, that's okay
[9203.29s -> 9205.45s]  Oh hell is that newbert over there?
[9209.14s -> 9211.46s]  Oh newbert's here. Sorry trash can guy
[9212.50s -> 9222.18s]  This is an eggplant. I'm newbert. Everybody loves me. That's why I live in this trash
[9231.96s -> 9233.56s]  No time for this guy
[9233.56s -> 9235.16s]  All right, so should I go up?
[9235.16s -> 9238.33s]  It's a lone door frame, but for some reason you can't see through it
[9243.42s -> 9245.74s]  That's my man. That's my man newbert
[9246.30s -> 9252.14s]  By the way chris, I just remembered although you can only carry 12 items around
[9252.62s -> 9255.42s]  Your storage will hold any extra items you pick up. Yeah
[9256.14s -> 9258.14s]  You can access it where you check recruits
[9258.78s -> 9261.34s]  Enemies you spare get recruited to our town remember
[9262.22s -> 9266.04s]  It's a pretty useful information
[9266.12s -> 9276.17s]  It is there's a fork in the path chris it seems like it might be advantageous
[9277.35s -> 9278.87s]  If we split up
[9278.87s -> 9282.49s]  Who do you want to go with?
[9282.49s -> 9284.97s]  Uh, well rousy has the heel so i'm gonna go with rousy
[9288.38s -> 9290.38s]  that's i'm just
[9290.54s -> 9292.54s]  Basing this on how I feel
[9293.02s -> 9297.50s]  With i'm i'm gonna go with rousy because I suzy does not have a heel right now
[9298.22s -> 9302.06s]  And i'm going with rousy. That's my decision. That's what i've decided
[9302.78s -> 9305.82s]  If anybody wants to call me cringe like I just saw five people said cringe
[9306.54s -> 9307.74s]  That's fine
[9307.74s -> 9315.06s]  I'm apparently i'm cringe. I'm going with rousy. Hey, why does chris get to choose all the time?
[9316.30s -> 9318.73s]  Rousy you're going with me
[9318.73s -> 9327.77s]  Uh crap
[9327.77s -> 9332.38s]  Okay, i'm gonna explain the joke. I didn't do the joke. I'm gonna explain it though
[9335.48s -> 9337.48s]  Sit down sit down sit down not yet
[9337.64s -> 9338.70s]  um
[9338.70s -> 9340.94s]  I was gonna just do like a fart sound like
[9342.22s -> 9344.41s]  And then go man
[9344.41s -> 9346.65s]  I've been holding that in for like three hours. Thank god i'm alone
[9346.65s -> 9356.63s]  I
[9360.55s -> 9362.87s]  Somebody liked it somebody liked that somebody thought that was funny
[9364.09s -> 9366.09s]  I'm clearing that we're not doing that again the rest of stream
[9366.65s -> 9369.62s]  I just cleared it
[9369.62s -> 9371.62s]  I that that voice is not happening anymore. We're done
[9373.70s -> 9375.70s]  I cleared it. I cleared it from the xlr
[9376.34s -> 9392.04s]  All right, hold on. What can I do anything else? Oh shit. I can go this way. What's that?
[9392.60s -> 9405.62s]  somebody's trash house
[9405.62s -> 9409.93s]  The door is locked
[9409.93s -> 9437.69s]  Is that just is that trashy's house? I would assume probably is don't look sad
[9437.93s -> 9440.23s]  You're never alone. You got new bird
[9444.23s -> 9449.67s]  You can hold a lot more in your storage, you know, oh, but you won't be able to use it during battle
[9450.39s -> 9452.39s]  Check it and make sure you have what you need
[9453.77s -> 9476.41s]  It's what I wanted to see what I already said. Why are you saying shush? Don't shush me. Welcome to
[9477.45s -> 9478.65s]  the
[9478.65s -> 9479.69s]  City
[9479.69s -> 9486.10s]  I just thought they were just back there. You have neither fluffy boys nor mean girls with you now
[9486.72s -> 9490.10s]  Reluctantly you are filled with the power from the cat sign
[9502.25s -> 9510.92s]  I heard the roller coasters are undergoing maintenance. That's a pain because it's our only form of public transit
[9514.14s -> 9518.22s]  Welcome to cyber city pedestrians need to press the switch to cross traffic
[9518.94s -> 9529.46s]  About how mad would you be?
[9529.46s -> 9531.94s]  You're in a car and you still sort of like just press the button
[9532.92s -> 9537.16s]  And the the walk sign happened everybody stopped and they just don't move and then they press it again
[9539.42s -> 9541.50s]  By the way, can somebody correct me here? I need to know this
[9542.22s -> 9545.82s]  I've been told like three different things about how that system works
[9547.40s -> 9553.00s]  Does that actually do anything? I've been told that when you press the the button it actually is just a placebo
[9553.00s -> 9555.00s]  It doesn't actually do anything
[9555.00s -> 9559.22s]  Is that accurate?
[9559.22s -> 9560.58s]  Some of them do
[9560.58s -> 9563.90s]  Some of them some do nothing
[9563.90s -> 9566.33s]  It depends depends on the city
[9566.33s -> 9567.93s]  So I have it
[9567.93s -> 9574.71s]  Just to give the pedestrian something to do to make it feel like they're doing something. It's a placebo effect
[9576.26s -> 9578.58s]  It depends on where but most actually do something
[9581.32s -> 9583.32s]  I've heard conflicting information over the years
[9589.27s -> 9591.27s]  Oh god, this is um
[9591.27s -> 9593.11s]  donkey kong country
[9593.11s -> 9596.47s]  The donkey don't come country. We have to jump and hit the lights and keep the lights on
[9598.04s -> 9602.78s]  Whatever it is the stop thing
[9602.86s -> 9606.26s]  Oh
[9606.26s -> 9614.25s]  Oh nice
[9614.25s -> 9618.84s]  That level was brutal. It really was it was horrible
[9619.48s -> 9623.32s]  What are we cleaning up for you ask?
[9623.72s -> 9625.72s]  We don't know a parade perhaps
[9625.96s -> 9627.24s]  possibly
[9627.24s -> 9632.28s]  Hey, how bad am I peas?
[9632.44s -> 9634.44s]  I have to switch out this thing. I think
[9634.92s -> 9636.92s]  When I say like oh like a peter
[9636.92s -> 9640.12s]  A peter piper picked a pick of pickled peppers, right?
[9641.00s -> 9643.00s]  It's it kind of sucks, right?
[9643.78s -> 9645.78s]  You get are you getting the uh the pops?
[9645.94s -> 9652.17s]  Because I feel like sometimes it happens. Is it good?
[9654.86s -> 9657.66s]  I swear to god. I feel like it happens a lot. I think I have to get a new pop filter
[9658.22s -> 9665.70s]  A large event is going to happen in the streets later. We were told to make room for something big
[9666.42s -> 9672.71s]  We're trashed
[9672.71s -> 9674.23s]  dug through the trash
[9674.23s -> 9675.91s]  Found twenty dollars
[9675.91s -> 9678.23s]  Only dark dollars was added to your money hole
[9683.85s -> 9685.85s]  They're making room for your ass
[9687.32s -> 9691.86s]  Good one. Whoa pop-ups popped up
[9692.42s -> 9695.75s]  I kind of want to kill the pop-ups
[9695.75s -> 9700.15s]  All right pop-up, uh click or block click. I'm gonna click the pop-up
[9700.87s -> 9705.37s]  You unconsciously clicked on an ad for a video about making knives out of spaghetti
[9708.38s -> 9712.36s]  That made another one click here click here click click
[9713.16s -> 9718.98s]  Oh, that sucks
[9718.98s -> 9721.54s]  Up up is preening its weird rubbery flesh
[9723.21s -> 9724.41s]  All right block
[9724.41s -> 9726.58s]  It's why repeatedly block the ads
[9730.15s -> 9732.15s]  Walk 10 ads happy
[9734.30s -> 9735.66s]  Oh now I can see
[9735.66s -> 9740.42s]  Okay
[9740.42s -> 9741.62s]  It's there
[9741.62s -> 9751.11s]  It's easy with no ads
[9751.11s -> 9755.85s]  Now click it again. No
[9756.01s -> 9765.46s]  I don't want to click the ad again. I clicked it once
[9770.54s -> 9780.52s]  cd bagel nice
[9780.52s -> 9783.78s]  Okay, what are you doing here?
[9783.86s -> 9787.74s]  Who are you and what are you doing here? Chris? What are you?
[9788.78s -> 9790.78s]  Oh, no. Hell, sweetie
[9792.60s -> 9794.04s]  Don't let her find me
[9794.04s -> 9798.01s]  No, well, sweetie darling, honey. Where are you?
[9799.13s -> 9801.13s]  We're a team now remember
[9801.37s -> 9803.37s]  You still have to be my willing minion
[9805.02s -> 9806.28s]  Chris
[9806.28s -> 9807.64s]  It appears
[9807.64s -> 9810.52s]  Our comrades have pressed the escape key on us
[9812.15s -> 9814.07s]  So it has come to this
[9814.07s -> 9820.60s]  In order to find our teams
[9821.32s -> 9823.32s]  We must form an uneasy truce
[9826.82s -> 9829.14s]  Queen my splendid queen. Where are you?
[9830.31s -> 9832.31s]  Oh, no, don't let him fight me
[9836.63s -> 9839.59s]  Ah chris not the life form I was looking for
[9841.40s -> 9843.88s]  Hmm, where's the rest of the c plus squad?
[9845.11s -> 9847.11s]  Don't tell me you've got abandoned
[9847.67s -> 9851.69s]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha that's what you get for trusting susie

[9856.09s -> 9857.38s]  fiend
[9857.38s -> 9858.58s]  They're just
[9858.58s -> 9860.58s]  They're just busy retro gaming somewhere
[9861.50s -> 9863.90s]  I bet they're waiting for me on the player select screen
[9865.14s -> 9867.14s]  Listening to strangely groovy music
[9870.31s -> 9873.45s]  Uh, so it's come to this
[9874.78s -> 9876.78s]  In order to find our respective teams
[9877.66s -> 9881.04s]  It appears we must form an uneasy truce
[9881.68s -> 9886.92s]  He said you could double truces
[9888.89s -> 9890.89s]  Huh? Did you hear something?
[9894.30s -> 9896.30s]  No, it's just the sounds of the city
[9898.28s -> 9900.27s]  Oh, okay
[9900.27s -> 9902.91s]  Well, i'll be ahead don't be late
[9903.55s -> 9911.55s]  First as part of our truce better one keep distracting birdly and find a well
[9912.59s -> 9914.96s]  Oh, you see
[9915.52s -> 9917.69s]  Birdly he's
[9918.25s -> 9921.48s]  Okay, there's nothing wrong with him. He's just annoying
[9922.44s -> 9929.47s]  Toodles yes, I um if it's okay
[9930.68s -> 9933.61s]  Don't even refer another truce

[10432.62s -> 10433.82s]  Oh

[10437.10s -> 10440.06s]  But I interest you in some brand new dating shoes
[10441.18s -> 10445.52s]  Huh? No, you've got it. Totally wrong chris and I are just um friends
[10446.48s -> 10452.44s]  This has been my neighbor forever. We've been through so much. Sometimes it feels like we know each other better than anyone
[10453.47s -> 10455.95s]  It's somehow it's hard to say. We're exactly friends
[10458.88s -> 10459.76s]  I
[10459.76s -> 10461.48s]  I mean
[10461.48s -> 10463.42s]  we're

[10500.67s -> 10503.71s]  Any way to deal with crushing existential dread?
[10504.67s -> 10506.19s]  Asking for a friend
[10506.19s -> 10509.31s]  Friend that looks and sounds exactly like me
[10510.76s -> 10518.64s]  You're talking about me
[10523.61s -> 10533.26s]  All right, that's best that's best joke of the game so far without a doubt that was definitely the best routine so far
[10539.50s -> 10541.18s]  No, leave me alone

[10572.03s -> 10580.04s]  The game lost in the craftsmanship of the boxes
[10588.96s -> 10590.96s]  Oh, it's the queen. She's right over there
[10591.28s -> 10595.10s]  Can you distract her somehow?
[10595.74s -> 10599.72s]  Oh

[10619.84s -> 10621.76s]  Look chris
[10621.76s -> 10623.88s]  crisscross applesauce
[10623.88s -> 10626.92s]  Now that we are truces. I feel like we are on the same
[10628.26s -> 10630.57s]  mathematical wavelength
[10631.23s -> 10633.00s]  And you get me chris
[10633.00s -> 10635.00s]  You do not do
[10635.16s -> 10639.80s]  You do not do crazy things like have opinions or scream when I capture you
[10640.44s -> 10643.61s]  Or tell me horrible plans for smart boy theme park
[10644.49s -> 10646.33s]  I just cannot compute it
[10646.33s -> 10648.33s]  Why everyone else is so ungrateful?
[10650.73s -> 10655.15s]  I learned that from master shake. Whoops. That was my extra dangerous glass

[10670.51s -> 10671.71s]  It's okay
[10671.71s -> 10676.86s]  You do not have to answer
[10676.86s -> 10678.14s]  You would be wrong
[10678.14s -> 10680.14s]  But chris while we're still truces
[10680.54s -> 10682.54s]  Maybe we could make the most of it
[10682.94s -> 10687.08s]  We could play that game again. Wasn't that fun chris?
[10688.91s -> 10690.67s]  Just you and me
[10690.67s -> 10692.67s]  Having a good time

[10771.36s -> 10777.05s]  Wow cool face

[10789.10s -> 10791.10s]  It's silly looking but it beats hiding
[10794.16s -> 10800.56s]  Let's get going chris. Look, it's you. Oh
[10801.90s -> 10803.18s]  oh

[10808.96s -> 10814.67s]  Okay, let's go for a reel this time. What is this?
[10816.27s -> 10818.27s]  That's a big laugh. That's like a fuck
[10819.80s -> 10823.90s]  You chris, can you stop looking at this?
[10824.54s -> 10832.48s]  You became lost in the craftsmanship
[10832.88s -> 10834.88s]  Why do we have to look at it twice?
[10835.04s -> 10839.58s]  Because there's so much to look at here
[10839.58s -> 10841.98s]  chris
[10841.98s -> 10844.25s]  It's a work of art
[10844.25s -> 10846.59s]  What part are you looking at?
[10846.59s -> 10850.14s]  If I say I like it, will you stop looking at it?
[10851.87s -> 10854.24s]  Isn't this thing just the best?
[10854.32s -> 10856.32s]  The statue seems to suck bad
[10857.39s -> 10858.43s]  chris
[10858.43s -> 10860.78s]  There's no reason to look at this
[10860.78s -> 10863.47s]  There's no reason to look at this anymore. There's no reason
[10868.91s -> 10872.89s]  Oh, it's our friends
[10872.89s -> 10874.97s]  Energetic music wafts from the boxes
[10875.85s -> 10877.85s]  Filled with the power of musical bagels
[10878.41s -> 10885.10s]  What'll it be chief?
[10885.18s -> 10886.54s]  Oh, I hope you didn't hear that
[10886.54s -> 10889.42s]  I think the music was covering it but like a frog sound came out of my mouth because I
[10889.74s -> 10891.74s]  You know what I mean? I internally burped
[10892.38s -> 10894.54s]  What'll it be chief? I got cd bagels 80 dollars pop
[10897.66s -> 10898.94s]  Uh, let's just talk
[10898.94s -> 10902.30s]  Who is that? Uh mademoiselle leave her alone cap
[10903.02s -> 10905.74s]  Nice radio antenna you got there. Those are antlers cap
[10906.83s -> 10908.19s]  Huh? I oh
[10908.19s -> 10911.20s]  Let's play her a song
[10924.99s -> 10926.27s]  I was waiting
[10926.27s -> 10928.99s]  How's it hanging? We're making some extra money by selling in the city
[10929.63s -> 10931.63s]  We gotta make those bucks somehow
[10931.63s -> 10934.51s]  Gotta buy new gear gotta get new kicks. I want to be a car
[10935.55s -> 10939.07s]  Good thinking kk gotta have a way to get around honk honk
[10940.03s -> 10945.45s]  You like the big statue building it sucked took a lot of scrap
[10946.01s -> 10948.17s]  The other job we did was way better. It was big
[10948.81s -> 10951.18s]  It's gonna blow your mind. It was big
[10951.90s -> 10958.00s]  I don't think I need any items, but that's all I have is bagels
[10958.72s -> 10963.20s]  Okay, i'm gonna buy
[10963.20s -> 10966.01s]  I'm gonna buy two bagels
[10966.09s -> 10974.84s]  Because I don't think I have a heel right? I feel like there's probably a boss coming on here
[10976.54s -> 10983.58s]  Yeah, what kind of bagels do you like?
[10984.38s -> 10986.38s]  Uh, I like everything bagels
[10987.08s -> 10990.92s]  One problem with everything bagels though is you are going to have to clean your counter
[10991.40s -> 10994.36s]  Doesn't matter how careful you are doesn't matter what you use for a plate or a thing to hold it
[10995.08s -> 10996.80s]  um
[10996.80s -> 10998.08s]  little like
[10998.08s -> 11001.68s]  Bird seed is gonna be all over your entire counter and it's a pain absolute ass
[11004.43s -> 11006.43s]  You take a bite out of an everything bagel
[11006.83s -> 11009.63s]  It's like being at the beach like sand just gets in your underwear
[11010.84s -> 11013.20s]  It's worth it
[11013.28s -> 11016.64s]  Welcome to cyber shoes too free samples. Would you like one?

[13735.41s -> 13736.77s]  Why her?
[13736.77s -> 13743.25s]  Wait, let me guess is it because she's weak enough to make it and you can make me and make the person into a peon
[13744.61s -> 13747.36s]  No, just the opposite
[13747.84s -> 13751.98s]  It's because she's strong. What? Huh?
[13753.26s -> 13758.00s]  Let's stop the car. What's wrong with it?
[13759.04s -> 13761.04s]  um
[13761.60s -> 13764.72s]  I was just concerned because it hadn't exploded yet
[13766.45s -> 13768.45s]  Looks like we'll have to split up on foot
[13771.02s -> 13772.30s]  She's such a
[13772.30s -> 13773.98s]  weirdo
[13773.98s -> 13780.48s]  Chris if you see noel tell her my knowledge of her preferences is absolute and if she needs proof
[13781.04s -> 13784.61s]  Use this queen's mixtape was thrown into your key items
[13785.97s -> 13796.26s]  Toodles for you somehow. I feel like we're almost out of here
[13796.90s -> 13811.98s]  Let's go chris check on lancer. Hey, thanks for the tape. I was hungry push my tummy to hear a cool song. That's it
[13833.66s -> 13839.81s]  Nice gosh, that was close. Wasn't it chris?
[13840.69s -> 13849.04s]  This strange world this big city. It's so wild. It kind of makes my head spin looks like another puzzle
[13850.00s -> 13852.00s]  Maybe if I go down here
[13852.16s -> 13854.93s]  okay
[13854.93s -> 13862.74s]  e e
[13864.46s -> 13871.04s]  E e I said the city makes my head spin
[13871.92s -> 13873.92s]  I didn't mean in a bad way, you know
[13874.08s -> 13876.08s]  I was wanting to go someplace new, you know
[13877.68s -> 13880.64s]  E e c and des always told me she'd take me
[13881.36s -> 13883.79s]  Somewhere like this
[13883.87s -> 13887.63s]  Somewhere with shining lights e e c
[13890.53s -> 13892.53s]  e
[13892.53s -> 13896.54s]  C why don't you miss exploring chris back when the four of us were kids?
[13897.34s -> 13906.66s]  Gosh, remember that night. We explored the forest behind the graveyard. He's
[13908.26s -> 13909.86s]  December
[13909.86s -> 13914.50s]  I know we never found anything interesting back there. I mostly remember crying because I was scared
[13921.92s -> 13924.54s]  december
[13928.37s -> 13930.53s]  For some reason I feel nostalgic thinking about it
[13931.98s -> 13933.25s]  Yes
[13933.25s -> 13936.61s]  Yes wiping away my tears with the warm sleeves that smell like cinnamon
[13937.09s -> 13941.73s]  I guess I didn't mind being scared if it meant someone would comfort me
[13942.69s -> 13956.11s]  December chris is the only one who knows how weird I am. It's not fair. You know
[13956.75s -> 13959.12s]  Everyone knows how weird you are
[13963.26s -> 13973.01s]  December we got deals the ball throwing game prizes are seated under the counter
[13976.35s -> 13982.43s]  Ball throwing game prizes are seated under the counter. It's a ball throwing game prizes are seated under the counter, right?
[13983.23s -> 13984.67s]  bottom
[13984.67s -> 13986.67s]  All throwing games. Does this matter?
[13986.91s -> 13991.02s]  Does placement of this stuff matter? I feel like it kind of I feel like it does why?
[13995.06s -> 13997.06s]  Oh, no, she's coming back
[13997.30s -> 14004.18s]  I'll hide in that stall
[14004.18s -> 14007.57s]  Hey, check this out
[14011.14s -> 14012.42s]  Sweet right
[14012.42s -> 14016.08s]  Where's my prize?

[14018.00s -> 14021.02s]  here
[14021.02s -> 14024.21s]  Nice
[14024.21s -> 14026.21s]  Wait, I actually don't want this
[14028.34s -> 14031.34s]  Nobody does
[14032.46s -> 14034.46s]  How was that
[14034.46s -> 14037.98s]  Uh suzy, you're not supposed to attack people with it
[14038.86s -> 14043.58s]  Oh, yeah, watch me chris. There you are
[14044.30s -> 14051.49s]  Chris check out my new attack plus two healing you felt slightly healed
[14052.53s -> 14054.93s]  How's that meet the new healing master chris?
[14056.29s -> 14058.69s]  Oh, yes, she is a real master at it chris
[14060.29s -> 14062.29s]  God teaching you sarcasm was a mistake
[14063.84s -> 14065.84s]  Hey
[14066.08s -> 14069.44s]  Oh chris, what's that you have there? Is that a gift for someone?

[14081.50s -> 14086.93s]  I think I want to give this to birdly chris. Have you seen?
[14088.85s -> 14098.58s]  Chris we took a break from trucing for one second and you're already back with suzy should have expected this
[14100.30s -> 14102.86s]  You couldn't keep up with my puzzle solving skills
[14106.37s -> 14110.34s]  Uh-huh
[14110.34s -> 14112.66s]  plush of
[14112.66s -> 14115.39s]  me with nipples
[14116.96s -> 14125.87s]  Um, I guess i'll forgive you for now. See you chris. All right. Why the hell did you give it to birdly?
[14125.87s -> 14128.27s]  Why did you give it to birdly? What unexpected kindness?
[14129.55s -> 14133.57s]  Let's just get the hell out of here. Wait
[14134.29s -> 14139.06s]  noelle

[14146.48s -> 14148.08s]  Glad you're okay though
[14148.08s -> 14157.25s]  Since that stupid queen took you I was kind of worried. Yeah, I don't thump thump. That's the foot tap. Wait
[14157.81s -> 14159.81s]  Aren't you on their side?
[14159.81s -> 14160.69s]  Huh?

[14172.11s -> 14174.06s]  That's right. We have a truce
[14174.06s -> 14176.06s]  Chris said I could be on your team
[14177.02s -> 14179.02s]  Oh really?
[14179.26s -> 14182.85s]  Well, if chris said so I guess didn't really want to kill you anyway
[14186.67s -> 14196.48s]  So get in line already. Oh, okay chris also said I should be behind suzy
[14197.84s -> 14199.84s]  Uh, well chris said so

[14212.50s -> 14226.58s]  Our party is complete. That's funny. Oh save point. Um, I should probably go pee
[14228.45s -> 14230.45s]  Yeah, let's go. All right. Let me take a break
[14230.53s -> 14232.26s]  I'm gonna get some water

[14541.50s -> 14544.38s]  That's the best gamer snack. It's quick
[14544.94s -> 14548.85s]  You don't need to eat very many of them
[14548.85s -> 14550.85s]  peanuts too, but especially almonds
[14551.01s -> 14552.91s]  They're calorie dense
[14552.91s -> 14556.19s]  They're nutrient dense
[14556.19s -> 14558.59s]  Very crunchy. They're very crunchy as you can tell
[14559.23s -> 14563.90s]  That was larry. I was just doing larry david

[14602.51s -> 14606.03s]  Until I've received the completion of chapter two's completion
[14606.75s -> 14611.78s]  Okay
[14611.78s -> 14615.79s]  About two to three hours at this pace about three or four hours. Okay
[14616.67s -> 14618.27s]  Okay
[14618.27s -> 14620.75s]  Okay, you're exactly halfway through
[14621.90s -> 14624.70s]  Really?
[14624.70s -> 14626.54s]  About two or three. Okay
[14626.54s -> 14631.49s]  Okay
[14631.49s -> 14632.37s]  so
[14632.37s -> 14634.37s]  Well, here's what's probably gonna happen
[14634.37s -> 14639.94s]  We're gonna go for a little longer
[14639.94s -> 14641.94s]  Probably like another hour i'd say
[14644.67s -> 14646.67s]  and then tomorrow
[14646.99s -> 14650.83s]  We're gonna open with this i'm gonna complete it and then we'll move on to the umbrella game

[14654.93s -> 14660.19s]  You know what I mean? I don't want to just like
[14660.19s -> 14663.87s]  Do a seven hour stream and like eight hour stream blow throughs and just forget it tomorrow
[14664.51s -> 14667.97s]  You also have to do the secret boss i'll try
[14671.17s -> 14673.41s]  All right, so we'll go for like another hour. Let's go
[14674.13s -> 14703.36s]  I take the stairs of the teacups. What's the point of that? Wait, I know. Um to turn up that force field
[14705.23s -> 14707.23s]  Just stay standing on this switch

[14716.00s -> 14726.96s]  The treasure of air where three are one place one to three
[14727.68s -> 14731.39s]  Perhaps it means we all have to enter one teacup
[14732.88s -> 14735.12s]  I don't like doing it but it works
[14735.12s -> 14747.86s]  Okay, you're eating a tuna melt
[14750.00s -> 14751.12s]  I wish
[14751.12s -> 14752.72s]  For a split second
[14752.72s -> 14758.00s]  And I mean like one full second I could snap my fingers and just be you for one second
[14759.15s -> 14760.75s]  Right when you take a bite
[14760.75s -> 14765.55s]  Like you bite down. I mean i'm you now i'm not you. I just I you know what I mean god
[14766.27s -> 14768.66s]  I just want to be you for one second
[14768.66s -> 14770.98s]  It's like I want to eat that delicious fucking tuna milk

[14797.57s -> 14799.81s]  Well, do we have tuna haters in the chat right here?
[14800.37s -> 14802.80s]  Like a tuna fish a tuna fish sandwich
[14805.71s -> 14807.07s]  We don't right?
[14807.07s -> 14815.30s]  There's nothing in here
[14815.30s -> 14822.98s]  All for nothing. Tuna is good. Just don't take too long. Okay, wait
[14823.62s -> 14828.56s]  Do more silence
[14828.56s -> 14834.93s]  Tuna is amazing
[14834.93s -> 14837.17s]  Well, let me rephrase that I like tuna
[14838.05s -> 14840.37s]  I hold on. Sorry. Let me redo that
[14841.25s -> 14842.45s]  I like
[14842.45s -> 14844.02s]  tuna
[14844.02s -> 14845.14s]  but
[14845.14s -> 14849.38s]  It has to be cooked all the way through i'm talking tuna from the can
[14849.94s -> 14857.66s]  Let me show you my ultimate healing move
[14857.66s -> 14859.10s]  Get hit
[14859.10s -> 14860.38s]  avoid
[14860.38s -> 14882.43s]  Lucy told you to avoid getting hit by the ambulances. Okay. I smell like ice proful
[14883.05s -> 14884.91s]  isopropyl alcohol
[14884.91s -> 14892.32s]  It was amazing from the can
[14892.32s -> 14894.96s]  Yeah, that's how I like it like that. You take it out of the can
[14895.52s -> 14897.28s]  You mush it up with a fork
[14897.28s -> 14900.64s]  You get it to I don't know this might sound gross, but it's not
[14901.60s -> 14908.08s]  You get it to a paste consistency slightly chunky. Don't go too crazy. So it's not like like baby puke. You know what I mean?
[14915.73s -> 14917.73s]  Hat food. Yeah, what's okay? Sure
[14921.06s -> 14923.22s]  So, um, why are you all writing a teacup together?
[14931.02s -> 14934.67s]  Nuclear bunker andy
[14934.75s -> 14936.83s]  No, you have no idea going to school
[14937.71s -> 14940.30s]  opening up my lunch
[14940.30s -> 14942.22s]  and I had
[14942.22s -> 14944.46s]  Tuna sandwich in there. That was a big deal
[14945.26s -> 14949.97s]  It's like wait mom. What's in there? What's the sandwich?
[14950.77s -> 14955.73s]  Usually it would be just like bologna and american cheese, right? Oh man. What if it was tuna fish?
[14955.81s -> 14957.81s]  We were eating that day
[14957.97s -> 14959.97s]  It was amazing if that was in there
[14965.54s -> 14967.54s]  I would eat it so fast
[14971.52s -> 14973.14s]  too fast
[14973.14s -> 14975.14s]  We were eating fast that day
[14984.27s -> 14988.03s]  Wait, where'd they all go? Oh, wait, isn't the hacker do this?
[15001.14s -> 15002.90s]  You're being invaded
[15002.90s -> 15006.85s]  Wait, I don't want to pop the balloons
[15006.85s -> 15009.58s]  No, I want to keep the balloons

[15080.45s -> 15082.45s]  You're gonna be freaking out
[15082.45s -> 15087.26s]  And you're gonna go to the bottom to see what you won and it's gonna be two dollars for each slot

[15194.16s -> 15197.52s]  Oh, it tricked me. I don't like this one. I'm very hard at this one
[15198.24s -> 15211.89s]  She ate the cheese. This is the time that you played halo on impossible difficulty and hated it. Yes
[15212.69s -> 15216.78s]  The only time i've ever played halo in my life
[15217.50s -> 15219.42s]  We played it on impossible
[15219.42s -> 15221.42s]  And we didn't even make it out of the tutorial
[15222.03s -> 15224.19s]  And I never played it again and I hate the series
[15225.07s -> 15226.99s]  That's so fucked up
[15226.99s -> 15231.78s]  Oh, wait a second. Where's noelle?
[15231.78s -> 15234.50s]  Sorry, I just never seen fireworks up close before
[15236.06s -> 15238.06s]  Fuck you for that. What?
[15239.41s -> 15241.41s]  Those bullets what you scared?
[15241.97s -> 15245.25s]  Uh, um, I guess so. Maybe that's uh, why I couldn't stop watching
[15246.45s -> 15259.82s]  Fuck you for doing that zero to catch mice
[15262.75s -> 15267.76s]  Okay, so how do we you put the mice in the hole?
[15269.50s -> 15271.50s]  Ah, okay. I get it
[15271.50s -> 15275.68s]  Wait, I need a mouse
[15275.68s -> 15281.70s]  Where do I get a mouse?
[15281.70s -> 15283.70s]  Oh, okay. You have to let him go
[15284.10s -> 15294.54s]  What do I think about the final smash dlc fighter? I don't even know who it is
[15294.94s -> 15305.26s]  Wait, I don't think they even announced it yet. Are they announcing it like next week 20 more?
[15307.52s -> 15310.48s]  Maybe if we um split up the world. I wonder who it's gonna be obviously honestly
[15311.04s -> 15314.06s]  because
[15314.06s -> 15316.62s]  This is the last smash character ever right?
[15317.98s -> 15321.02s]  I don't know. Are they gonna make another smash brothers? They kind of can't
[15323.55s -> 15327.47s]  If they make another smash brothers, they can't who they're gonna add for characters like mr clean
[15328.11s -> 15339.70s]  How are they gonna do this again make a prediction? I'm gonna make a prediction. Um, yeah
[15340.02s -> 15345.78s]  Unless they start adding serial mascots. There's no way there's gonna be another smash brothers. I'm gonna say because okay
[15346.50s -> 15350.10s]  They're either gonna do one of two things. The first thing they're gonna do is they're gonna do some
[15350.90s -> 15354.83s]  Incredibly iconic video game character that is not there yet
[15355.79s -> 15358.85s]  Like I don't know
[15359.17s -> 15362.90s]  Like the doom guy, right?
[15362.90s -> 15368.74s]  I saw that floating around before and that would make a little bit sense like oh doom like gaming history, right?
[15369.14s -> 15375.25s]  but what they probably are gonna do it's probably gonna be crash bandicoot because
[15376.05s -> 15378.05s]  That would be the ultimate
[15378.62s -> 15379.80s]  nintendo
[15379.80s -> 15381.34s]  microsoft
[15381.34s -> 15385.98s]  Collaboration between every third party. It's probably gonna be crash bandicoot. It probably will
[15388.46s -> 15390.46s]  It's like playstation sony sega
[15391.22s -> 15397.90s]  Microsoft i'll tell you. Oh, all right. All right. Here's a prediction. I'll make that will make me really upset
[15398.38s -> 15401.87s]  It better not be a fire emblem character, right?
[15402.91s -> 15410.94s]  That would be like you can't do that for the final character if it wasn't gonna be crash bandicoot or so. I don't know
[15413.33s -> 15414.13s]  I
[15414.13s -> 15415.73s]  Shinkuro Miyamoto
[15415.73s -> 15426.94s]  Can I say like that? I don't know that might that would be actually that could happen. It's not gonna be waluigi
[15427.02s -> 15442.75s]  No that that that unless it was it april 1st. Hope they put mario in phoenix, right?
[15442.75s -> 15444.75s]  I don't know if phoenix right is gonna be the last character
[15444.75s -> 15454.51s]  I'm trying to think of anybody else that I think would actually be in the final slot
[15454.99s -> 15462.46s]  I know i'm sorry. I'll play the game play again. I'll give me one more second crash bandicoot doom guy
[15462.62s -> 15464.24s]  Shigeru Miyamoto
[15464.24s -> 15466.24s]  Or i'll give you one like the top four
[15469.07s -> 15474.37s]  um
[15474.37s -> 15476.21s]  Fucking ronald mcdonald
[15476.21s -> 15478.96s]  I don't know. That'd be awesome
[15479.20s -> 15483.79s]  I would okay. Let me ask you would you be upset?
[15484.35s -> 15494.35s]  If ronald mcdonald was the last character. No, you'd be you'd be so happy everybody would go crazy
[15499.23s -> 15502.91s]  I've said this before but I tell you where they really messed up is not putting scrooge mcduck in the game because that was
[15502.91s -> 15508.11s]  A classic nintendo game. He has a move set that makes perfect sense. He's got the pogo. He's got the gems
[15508.11s -> 15509.63s]  He's got the golf swing
[15509.63s -> 15513.07s]  It was a mistake to not put him in there and you already have disney bullshit in the game with the
[15514.19s -> 15524.67s]  Wait, do they have disney bullshit in the game? Is there disney bullshit in the game? Fuck. It's gonna be sora
[15525.76s -> 15528.88s]  No, it's not nobody cares about kingdom hearts right now. That should have been like a year ago
[15528.96s -> 15539.84s]  No, it's not gonna be sora now. Okay. I would have agreed with sora if this was like
[15540.38s -> 15541.60s]  2019
[15541.60s -> 15547.63s]  Like early 2020. Nope too late rayman would be cool
[15547.95s -> 15551.15s]  All right, i'll release the mice susie will break the balloons when they reach the top
[15551.47s -> 15558.88s]  Chrono from chrono trigger. No, oh, they don't give a shit about that franchise
[15562.98s -> 15566.34s]  Susie will break the balloons when they reach the top and chris you catch them
[15566.82s -> 15573.20s]  Okay, they picked the characters in november 2019. Oh, that's you know, that's right
[15574.61s -> 15576.77s]  That's actually correct. It really might be sora
[15577.65s -> 15579.65s]  But don't you think you would do that?
[15580.32s -> 15582.32s]  Not as the last character
[15584.40s -> 15585.92s]  All right, hold on
[15585.92s -> 15588.72s]  Because honestly if you had okay the final character
[15589.36s -> 15590.88s]  Of the dlc
[15590.88s -> 15592.88s]  Should be banjo kazooie
[15592.88s -> 15596.58s]  Right unless you got somebody better than that. Think about it
[15598.53s -> 15602.69s]  Who have they put in the game so far that has like a huge impact on all of video games?
[15603.17s -> 15605.44s]  Is that i'm very bad at this
[15605.44s -> 15609.34s]  I'm saying like who could it be possibly that's that's more
[15610.14s -> 15616.96s]  Ridiculous than banjo minecraft steve. Yeah
[15618.14s -> 15620.86s]  But then who would the final person be it's not gonna be sora
[15623.76s -> 15628.64s]  If it was gonna be sora sora would have been announced where banjo was announced and banjo would be the last character
[15628.72s -> 15630.16s]  You see what i'm saying?
[15630.16s -> 15634.00s]  Because kingdom hearts 3 was relevant back then not now
[15638.21s -> 15649.07s]  Master chief, I don't know about that. Oh, yeah, take that you stupid mice. I'm seeing you enjoy puzzles susie
[15650.69s -> 15652.69s]  They aren't awful if you do them like that
[15653.41s -> 15662.03s]  Not bad. Well, that was kind of smart. Maybe a tetris block. Yeah
[15662.91s -> 15665.73s]  I mean nobody really thought that piranha plant was gonna be in the game
[15665.97s -> 15673.79s]  But that kind of just came out of nowhere. Can I?
[15674.51s -> 15679.57s]  Okay, let's i gotta pay attention to the game, but you have my thoughts crash bandicoot doom guy. Shigeru Miyamoto
[15680.27s -> 15681.39s]  uh
[15681.39s -> 15684.59s]  a regular nintendo nes where the controllers are your arms
[15685.63s -> 15687.31s]  and like two
[15687.31s -> 15690.83s]  Nes light guns are your legs. There's also I don't know maybe a possibility
[15700.80s -> 15708.53s]  Need one
[15708.53s -> 15710.53s]  He's so high
[15712.34s -> 15714.26s]  Oh
[15714.26s -> 15716.43s]  Look, we're finally close to the fountain
[15716.51s -> 15718.51s]  It's queen's mansion
[15718.59s -> 15721.15s]  Oh, what why did we come here?
[15724.45s -> 15726.61s]  Chris you brought noelle right to me
[15727.33s -> 15729.33s]  I knew our truce was the best
[15729.49s -> 15733.09s]  But unfortunately, that means truces are over
[15733.97s -> 15736.34s]  Noelle get over here
[15736.34s -> 15737.94s]  but I
[15737.94s -> 15740.88s]  Noelle I will only say it one time
[15741.98s -> 15745.76s]  Infinitely get over here. Get over here. Get over here. Get over here. Get over here. Get over here. Get over here
[15747.02s -> 15749.66s]  I noelle are you hesitating?
[15750.69s -> 15753.01s]  Let me if then this for you
[15753.57s -> 15755.76s]  how about if
[15755.76s -> 15760.72s]  You don't listen then a certain bird might take a ride in the acid river
[15762.22s -> 15763.50s]  birdly
[15763.50s -> 15767.09s]  That's right. He was just with us
[15767.09s -> 15769.25s]  We must have captured him and we weren't looking
[15769.89s -> 15776.61s]  I'm sorry chris suzy. I
[15776.93s -> 15778.93s]  I wish I could have stayed with you longer
[15779.41s -> 15782.16s]  I can't let birdly get hurt, you know
[15782.24s -> 15787.73s]  Don't be sad noelle, honey
[15787.81s -> 15789.81s]  All that remains is the final step

[15814.50s -> 15817.78s]  I see now her will must be unleashed by force
[15818.34s -> 15821.14s]  Perhaps if I make her face into a robot one
[15823.42s -> 15825.42s]  You said you wouldn't do that if I
[15826.40s -> 15833.79s]  Variable lying set to true we were going to be smart together. That's not fair understood
[15834.67s -> 15837.98s]  fairness activated
[15837.98s -> 15844.64s]  Hey, the thing I calibrated those cages. You said I could trust you

[15850.88s -> 15853.84s]  Birdly I only play mobile games
[15856.91s -> 15858.91s]  One of you is going to help me with my plan
[15859.73s -> 15861.73s]  And it's going to be noelle
[15863.06s -> 15865.14s]  The rest of you go to your rooms

[15881.22s -> 15883.84s]  I literally don't know
[15890.06s -> 15892.06s]  How do you like your new room units

[16301.18s -> 16309.39s]  Accidental smash on the keyboard. Susie's talktube thing looks a bit bigger for her larger head an egg
[16310.34s -> 16312.27s]  Painted egg. It's warm
[16312.27s -> 16314.91s]  from can harboil eggs hatch
[16317.36s -> 16334.64s]  Vacuum powered book from search query losers. This library sucks. Can I go in any of the rooms?
[16335.04s -> 16346.83s]  You respected the gamer's code. No screen peeking. You can smell the glittery cat food from here. Anyways
[16350.32s -> 16351.84s]  Uh, let's know
[16351.84s -> 16353.84s]  You feel like noelle would enjoy this more
[16357.25s -> 16359.25s]  Asriel's room peek inside. Yes
[16359.81s -> 16375.60s]  You opened the door with your eyes closed. You saw nothing for the feeling. You wouldn't learn anything. It was like a puzzle
[16376.80s -> 16378.00s]  think uh
[16378.00s -> 16380.00s]  Think you can do it chris
[16382.18s -> 16386.98s]  On your skinless boneless thighs everyone. I'll think of a solution
[16388.16s -> 16391.12s]  Chris just ignore him. I'll just be over here where I can't hear you
[16392.86s -> 16396.30s]  Now be here away from your iq debuffing aura
[16396.86s -> 16404.82s]  These dark bulbs will cast a bright shadow on the ground
[16406.62s -> 16411.18s]  Why are you doing a castle griffin state voice? I don't know because he's like i'm a hero. I'm a champion
[16411.74s -> 16413.98s]  He's like larping. So that's why
[16414.38s -> 16419.06s]  Fill in the space with dark to unlock the way
[16423.39s -> 16427.94s]  All right. See you tomorrow. Oh fuck. I can't leave
[16429.78s -> 16434.90s]  Ah chris still stumped by this simple diversion. That'll put your neurons back in the crayon box chris
[16435.30s -> 16438.10s]  I can already feel the solution welling up in my brain cavity
[16439.70s -> 16441.70s]  That's what I will say now go
[16443.63s -> 16446.59s]  Uh, I saved it back there
[16446.59s -> 16450.03s]  Yeah, all right if this is a good stopping point then this is a good stopping point i'm gonna i'm streaming tomorrow
[16451.14s -> 16467.55s]  But I would we're doing two days this weekend. So don't worry. This is a good point. Yeah, this is all right
[16468.11s -> 16471.50s]  So tomorrow might be a little longer than
[16472.00s -> 16475.50s]  Maybe because if this is only like another two hours, maybe
[16476.06s -> 16478.40s]  three hours
[16478.40s -> 16480.37s]  less
[16480.37s -> 16484.77s]  Than the umbrella game. Yeah, I think that makes sense
[16485.17s -> 16488.94s]  Because I think there's like two is there's like two or three hours in the umbrella game left
[16489.58s -> 16491.58s]  And there's like two hours left in this
[16493.38s -> 16494.98s]  So that's a
[16494.98s -> 16497.15s]  Should be like a five to six hour stream tomorrow
[16503.82s -> 16507.90s]  You have about two hours to completion if you do the secret area. Yeah, then that that makes sense then
[16508.46s -> 16512.64s]  Because I want time tomorrow to be able to well not time tomorrow. I want
[16513.36s -> 16518.05s]  Um, I want to have enough content tomorrow because I don't know if the umbrella game has more than an hour or two
[16528.34s -> 16534.67s]  Two hours pepe left for like three hours to be honest
[16535.55s -> 16537.55s]  Yeah, but I think we'll be okay
[16540.11s -> 16542.11s]  Depends on how long you take on some of the bosses. Yeah
[16545.20s -> 16547.92s]  And look tomorrow we can go a little long tomorrow. It's fine
[16548.93s -> 16552.29s]  I wanted to make sure I started it and got to a point where we could do it again tomorrow
[16559.65s -> 16566.54s]  Okay, and look I look if we if the next if it takes four or five hours to do tomorrow
[16567.34s -> 16573.30s]  Then whatever i'll play that that'll be it. I don't want to rush through this. That's the problem
[16573.38s -> 16575.38s]  I want to like take a time to like
[16576.56s -> 16581.97s]  Actually take in the information and stuff because before I don't know if you guys remember
[16582.61s -> 16587.17s]  If a game was like seven to eight hours before like seven ish hours
[16587.33s -> 16589.73s]  I would just blow through the whole thing in one stream sometimes
[16590.29s -> 16593.17s]  And then just be done with it and then just like okay, that's it. See you later
[16593.89s -> 16596.13s]  Um, I really want to like process this shit
[16596.69s -> 16598.69s]  It's like i've been waiting for this game to come out for a while
[16599.17s -> 16605.23s]  I don't just want to like just inhale like eight hours of a gamer session and just forget the whole game
[16605.63s -> 16608.93s]  I need my turtle half to process the game
[16611.58s -> 16614.62s]  Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow. Uh start at the same time two o'clock pacific
[16616.43s -> 16626.06s]  We'll finish this and if there's time we'll finish the umbrella game. Have a great rest of your evening
[16632.42s -> 16644.56s]  We're not done yet because i'm gonna go like this. Thanks for the subs. Appreciate it everybody. Thank you
[16647.86s -> 16658.53s]  Very much appreciated a little shorter than usual, but you know these days I don't really have a timer
[16661.07s -> 16666.53s]  But I do want each stream to be at least four to five hours. Maybe we go a little long tomorrow
[16671.79s -> 16678.74s]  Any grotto beast thing when grotto beast we will be talking very very deeply about grotto beasts
[16680.67s -> 16689.06s]  I'm hoping very deeply and I mean very deeply about a month from now. You'll be hearing a lot about it. I would say
[16692.43s -> 16699.26s]  Because I really want to make sure that it's possible to get it out for this year's like holiday season
[16700.59s -> 16711.82s]  What we're trying to do see if we hit that target grotto beast tournament prize pool
[16720.59s -> 16723.75s]  Philosophical grotto beast discussion with professor germa
[16728.67s -> 16732.75s]  Wait, what is grotto beast? You don't even need to know until I tell you
[16733.39s -> 16738.90s]  Probably three or four weeks from now
[16742.37s -> 16746.32s]  But I think before that you'll probably hear about a few things
[16746.96s -> 16753.66s]  Especially considering well, you know, why don't we just yeah, you know, maybe tomorrow or the night, you know
[16753.74s -> 16757.50s]  No, no, no, I I don't want to let me talk to people today and tonight and tomorrow
[16758.14s -> 16760.14s]  And make sure I get you some correct information
[16761.55s -> 16769.84s]  So maybe we'll talk about some stuff tomorrow. So now that you said that it's going to be another three months
[16774.75s -> 16778.75s]  Well, I mean technically it might probably is going to be three months before you can see it
[16779.55s -> 16781.95s]  Because that's what I want to have it you be able to get it
[16789.82s -> 16793.18s]  I don't have a release date for it. All I know is I want to be able to have it
[16794.04s -> 16802.05s]  Accessible before the end of december. That's what I want if it's possible. We'll see if not, then it'll come probably shortly after that
[16804.22s -> 16805.26s]  hope
[16805.26s -> 16815.07s]  Oh
[16815.07s -> 16816.83s]  Oh, that's a tip of the hats
[16816.83s -> 16818.77s]  So if you didn't know
[16818.77s -> 16822.29s]  Uh, actually a lot of people that probably are new to the channel don't really know that much about
[16823.17s -> 16824.77s]  me maybe
[16824.77s -> 16826.77s]  more than the last few years
[16826.85s -> 16829.65s]  Uh, but there was the team fortress 2 community
[16830.53s -> 16833.57s]  Did a charity event every year well tip of the hats
[16834.37s -> 16835.17s]  and
[16835.17s -> 16837.17s]  Uh, I would participate in it
[16837.49s -> 16839.49s]  As of probably i'd say like a few years ago
[16841.86s -> 16843.86s]  And I think they're doing their final one
[16845.31s -> 16846.11s]  this
[16846.11s -> 16849.86s]  The next couple of days, I think
[16849.86s -> 16851.86s]  So go, uh, definitely go support them
[16852.42s -> 16854.91s]  All the the old tf2 guys
[16855.23s -> 16858.50s]  I think they've moved on too. I think they're doing like valorant stuff now and
[16859.30s -> 16862.00s]  Um, they're all really really good people. So
[16862.88s -> 16864.32s]  Uh, we're gonna raid them
[16864.32s -> 16868.51s]  But this is the final one go support it go say hello
[16869.31s -> 16872.18s]  And I will see you guys tomorrow
[16872.18s -> 16877.70s]  Well, they're ending right now. All right, hold this for tomorrow. Hold this for tomorrow. It just ended. Oh shit
[16878.74s -> 16880.02s]  shit
[16880.02s -> 16883.14s]  All right, I think they're going tomorrow. They'll be back tomorrow. All right
[16883.70s -> 16888.75s]  We'll get them tomorrow
[16888.75s -> 16890.75s]  Hold hold till tomorrow
[16891.07s -> 16893.07s]  We're going there tomorrow
[16893.15s -> 16895.15s]  bad timing andy
[16895.39s -> 16899.07s]  But honestly like okay, so tomorrow before I go live they're gonna be live before I am
[16899.86s -> 16902.50s]  I'm certain of it probably around like 11 a.m. Um
[16903.30s -> 16906.24s]  I think they're gonna be live tomorrow somewhere around 11 to 12
[16908.48s -> 16910.00s]  Central time maybe
[16910.00s -> 16913.28s]  So they'll be live before I am so go support them before you you know
[16913.92s -> 16916.78s]  Do you want to stay then stay there?
[16916.78s -> 16924.50s]  So now all right, but we'll see if we can catch them tomorrow. Well now I got where we're gonna go
[16925.14s -> 16929.81s]  Who's streaming right now?
[16929.81s -> 16956.45s]  Uh, who's live?
[16956.45s -> 16958.61s]  Oh shit, I just broke my chair
[16960.85s -> 16963.17s]  Hold on. I was like leaning too far

[16983.10s -> 16990.78s]  I haven't really um
[16991.94s -> 16994.88s]  How do I fuck this up?
[16994.88s -> 16996.88s]  No, we're not delaying tomorrow because of that
[16997.68s -> 16999.92s]  Uh go say hi to kraken if you don't know kraken was
