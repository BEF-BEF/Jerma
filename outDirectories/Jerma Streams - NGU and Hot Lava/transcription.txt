[0.76s -> 19.77s]  Hello, how are you? Good afternoon. Stream will be idling soon. Maybe, possibly. We do have a few
[19.77s -> 30.47s]  options. I just saw this come out on Steam and needed to play it. I just want to see what's in
[30.47s -> 39.82s]  it. I have a pretty addictive personality and if something's fun, sometimes I want to do it more
[39.82s -> 51.19s]  than once, more than twice. The game we're going to play today is called NGU Idle. It's called
[51.19s -> 58.57s]  Numbers Go Up. And the whole point of the game is for numbers to increase in value. That's it.
[58.57s -> 66.81s]  There's nothing else in this game. So I have a backup in case this is not fun. All right,
[66.81s -> 72.17s]  there's two things that will happen. The stream's been live for a minute and a half. Here we go.
[73.62s -> 86.71s]  We will either play this for 30 minutes or 16 straight hours. We may also play this for
[86.71s -> 98.58s]  30 minutes and then move on to the floor is lava game. I don't know. I have no plan today. Don't
[98.58s -> 105.43s]  do it. I just made that up. I pretended like somebody said don't do it. What's the... No,
[105.43s -> 112.50s]  no. It's actually the floor is lava. The name of the game is called like Lava Floor. Right? What's
[112.50s -> 119.08s]  it called? What's the name of the game? What is the name of that game? A Hot Lava is the name of
[119.08s -> 128.42s]  the game actually. It's a parkour game where you can't touch the floor because of course the floor
[128.42s -> 138.65s]  is made out of lava. But we aren't going to do that yet. I've got a number game to get addicted
[138.65s -> 150.46s]  to first. Is this pre-recorded? Why would this be a pre-recorded stream? I would pick the numbers
[150.46s -> 155.42s]  go upstream to be pre-recorded. I mean, I guess that would make some sense now that I think about
[155.42s -> 162.15s]  it. It is just going to be us watching a screen with numbers going up in succession. But there's
[162.15s -> 171.74s]  RPG elements in this game. I guess. I've tried it. I opened it to just so I... I didn't want to be
[171.74s -> 176.38s]  the idiot that has no idea what he's doing. And yes, whoa, it's easy. You just watch numbers go
[176.38s -> 182.12s]  up. This is way more involved, I believe. I'll show it to you right now just so you can see.
[183.58s -> 195.29s]  Just so you completely understand. But there apparently there's like a jackass disclaimer.
[195.77s -> 200.76s]  I'm gonna assume this says like take a break every seven hours or something, right?
[201.32s -> 211.27s]  It has to be. It's gonna be like a Wiimote take a break thing. Somebody just give $50.
[211.27s -> 222.86s]  That's 5,000 bits from Phylactery Lich. Phylactery is back with another 5,000 bits. Can't wait to
[222.86s -> 229.21s]  watch my favorite streamers numbers go up. Now give me some box steps. The two completely different
[229.21s -> 235.64s]  streams the last... Yesterday we did a bunch of crazy shit in Hitman. Today, if you got a book
[235.72s -> 240.76s]  report to do, you know, just just to have it in the background. If you've got some work to do,
[242.17s -> 246.17s]  we can all just pretend we're playing this together because you could like go to sleep
[246.17s -> 252.95s]  if you want to. I know that like business management 101, I would get grabbed and like
[252.95s -> 256.39s]  an earpiece would be in my ear or something that says don't fucking tell your audience just to like
[256.39s -> 265.22s]  leave or sleep on stream. Well, I didn't tell you to leave. I told you to stay and study
[265.22s -> 268.98s]  because you have a book report due tomorrow. I saw somebody in the pre-stream chat.
[268.98s -> 273.67s]  They need it. They were like, I got this paper that's almost done. Do it now. Look what right now
[273.67s -> 281.38s]  with us. Well, I'm not going to do your paper for you, but do it now. It's a babysitting stream.
[282.10s -> 290.07s]  All right. If you've got... No, that's not right. Nevermind. Stop reminding me. All right. Let's
[290.07s -> 296.26s]  read this. It says whoomph. As you come to the first thing you notice the taste of copper in
[296.26s -> 304.78s]  your mouth. Why is it always that? Even a game like Portal had that. Remember when you walk through
[304.78s -> 308.78s]  the first thing, it's like, oh, the taste of iron and copper in your mouth is normal. It's always
[308.78s -> 317.82s]  like some metal that's in your mouth. The second being the stench of raw sewage all around you.
[317.82s -> 325.96s]  You get up nursing your busted lip and rubbing your head, which feels like it was lovingly caressed
[325.96s -> 332.97s]  by a concrete block. You try to remember how you got to, well, whatever this place is. You realize
[332.97s -> 337.96s]  with a surprising lack of panic that you've forgotten who you are. Based on the state you're
[337.96s -> 345.40s]  in right now, you're thinking they must have been an asshole. I love the writing in this.
[348.74s -> 355.21s]  That's such a great sentence. Tossed in a gross pit of sewage. At least for the short term,
[355.21s -> 360.25s]  you have an objective. Finding a way out of here. It kind of feels like the right thing to do. You
[360.25s -> 364.82s]  try to stand up, but your knees are weak. They shake, they buckle, and you fall back down.
[364.82s -> 369.86s]  It's only now that you feel the weakness in your body. Not any normal sort of weakness,
[369.86s -> 373.46s]  like when you stand up too quickly and get lightheaded or have your arm ripped off in
[373.46s -> 379.45s]  an industrial accident. No, you feel like something has sapped away the majority of your strength.
[379.45s -> 383.29s]  Well, there's nothing to do but to try to regain some of that strength and to get out of here.
[383.29s -> 394.76s]  Maybe hitting a big white button named play will let you do something fun.
[394.76s -> 408.71s]  All right, here we go. Fun is relative, I believe. But this is, uh, wait, has this been,
[408.71s -> 418.57s]  have this, this has just been on for an hour and 23 minutes because I was sitting at that screen.
[418.57s -> 422.94s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is, this is not right. This is incorrect. This is incorrect.
[422.94s -> 430.57s]  I have to restart it. We should do a new game. That new game. It was sitting at that press play
[430.57s -> 441.11s]  screen for an hour and 23 minutes, apparently. All right, whatever. We're good. I'll start a new game.
[441.11s -> 450.70s]  So I was ready for a total time played one hour and 23 minutes. No, this is, I was like eating
[450.70s -> 455.91s]  food and like getting the stream ready and like taking a shit. This is how long it takes for me
[455.91s -> 460.90s]  to start a stream, guys. That's an hour and 23 minutes. So I got everything ready and I was like,
[460.90s -> 464.58s]  all right, I've got to take shit. All right, that's 25 minutes. I got to take a shower. That's like
[464.58s -> 469.22s]  15, 20 minutes. I got to eat food. That's like 30 foot. Yeah. That's how long this is exactly how
[469.22s -> 477.82s]  long it takes for me to start a live stream after like getting up in the morning. 25 minutes. Shit.
[477.82s -> 485.26s]  Yeah. What are you talking about? I don't buy this for a second that some of you guys take.
[486.06s -> 491.91s]  I'm not 20 minutes, 15 minutes. I don't know. 10 minutes, 15 minutes. It depends on what I'm
[491.91s -> 496.36s]  reading on my iPhone. Look, if there's like a big thing on Twitter that I'm looking at,
[496.36s -> 503.21s]  I'm going to be there. It takes two minutes to take a shit. Holy fuck. What are you talking about?
[503.21s -> 507.96s]  How long does it take you to wipe your ass? It takes five minutes to wipe your ass.
[507.96s -> 515.83s]  Two minutes? You are a liar if you think that you can tell me right now that you wipe your
[515.83s -> 520.15s]  ass in less than five minutes. Nope. I don't believe you. And if you do that and that's
[520.15s -> 529.37s]  actually true, I don't know if that's totally, I don't know if it's totally clean or not.
[529.37s -> 533.21s]  Like a three minute ass wiping. All right. So first of all, that's all I need to say.
[540.42s -> 543.70s]  That's funny though. That actually is funny. That's how long it takes. Okay. Start a new game.
[544.95s -> 559.59s]  Oh, you come too. This guy has swamp ass. No, I want a clean body. Completely void of all filth.
[560.23s -> 566.98s]  All right. We're done. It took me two minutes to say that. Did it take me two minutes to do that?
[566.98s -> 574.81s]  No, it didn't. How long has Stream been live for? 10 minutes. What? We've been live for like three.
[574.81s -> 582.87s]  Oh God. All right. Hey there, whoever you are. Glad you decided to check out NGU. I'm something
[582.87s -> 587.59s]  of a game developer myself. The guy who made this game. People call me 4G for short. That's all
[587.59s -> 591.59s]  right. That's cool. I see the something. And then we had a ton more money just came in. What's
[591.59s -> 602.39s]  going on? Why are you guys giving so much money right now? Uh, La Crona gave 5,000 bits twice.
[602.39s -> 609.98s]  They gave, uh, 10,000 bits. Derma step up your shitting game, spread your ass cheeks. I don't
[609.98s -> 620.20s]  think I can read this. Your asshole. No, no, everybody has their own way to do that.
[622.79s -> 626.79s]  Everyone. If you talk to anybody and I am going to get a little gross. Okay.
[629.10s -> 633.29s]  No, I'm not. This is going to be, we're going to be PG for this one. They write books for kids
[633.29s -> 641.18s]  on this shit guys. Don't worry when you, but two different, two different people don't go to the
[641.18s -> 651.64s]  bathroom. Same way. Everybody has their own bathroom ritual. All of us. It's like built into
[651.64s -> 660.79s]  the DNA of humans. Some people, you know, they, they prep, they prep for like five minutes. They
[660.79s -> 666.73s]  just sit there. They prep. They did the prep work. Some people need to drink a coffee in the morning
[666.73s -> 671.13s]  to get themselves or water to get themselves going. That's prep work. That's included in the
[671.13s -> 684.70s]  ship time. There's also post work too. I stretch after I go to the second one because I want to
[684.70s -> 688.38s]  make sure everything's all, you know, the urine testings need to be kind of nice and moved around
[689.02s -> 697.16s]  jog in place for a minute, shake around. I stretch after I, what are you talking about?
[697.16s -> 717.86s]  What do you mean stop? What are you talking about? I'm talking about like I get up and like do like
[717.86s -> 731.14s]  touch my toes. I'm not doing these exercises in the bathroom. What is, what are you just talking
[731.14s -> 740.47s]  about? Somebody's gave another $5,000, but they say pee pee poo poo. That was bala koala for
[740.47s -> 749.34s]  5,000 bits. Wait, I hold on. Let me, I want to make this really, really, really completely
[749.34s -> 756.82s]  totally clear. I can't talk about my post shit activity, but I can get messages spammed here in
[756.82s -> 762.46s]  this chat room that says pee pee poo poo like he pooped his pants. There's a, I think there's a,
[762.46s -> 770.82s]  that's an issue. I think a bit. We put an image on screen yesterday of everybody laughing their
[770.82s -> 776.68s]  asses off it. A fake of me pissing my pants, but this is weird for me to talk about how I stretch
[776.68s -> 792.09s]  after I go to the bathroom. I gotta, I gotta restart. Do I have to restart? Debunk. No. All
[792.09s -> 795.93s]  right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This, this, I have like a, I'm flying like an airplane right
[795.93s -> 801.98s]  now. Like, hold on. What the fuck do I do? I love how that's like a message. All right. Well,
[801.98s -> 808.68s]  I'm just going to go. I got five, this is energy. Okay. You need energy. Fuck the tutorial gives
[808.68s -> 820.30s]  a shit. I know what to do. So we've got 500 energy with this. This increases each moment.
[820.30s -> 825.67s]  You can fight people. We have to, we have a thousand HP, a hundred attack, a hundred defense.
[826.23s -> 829.35s]  And we, uh, current rebirth time is six minutes and 26 seconds.
[830.41s -> 834.41s]  Auto save in seven seconds to make sure just in case something happens, you know, in case
[834.41s -> 838.57s]  you sit in there for too long and you got to get up and do some prep work before you use the bathroom
[838.57s -> 844.76s]  and then obviously do some stretching afterwards, get out of here. So basic training, we have idle
[844.76s -> 849.85s]  attack and idle block. We can't do these ones yet. And I mean, what do you say we turn on a little
[849.85s -> 853.69s]  bit of an OST here? My favorite OST in the world. We're talking about the turtles and time soundtrack.
[854.49s -> 867.30s]  Let's get it going. I have 250 energy. Let's just spam attack. Look at my attack going out.
[867.30s -> 876.78s]  That's a number rising increasingly. That's the whole thing. There's no other songs.
[880.63s -> 887.85s]  Numbers go up. This is going to get much more interesting. Maybe, maybe I have not figured that
[887.85s -> 893.72s]  out yet. I was going to play it, but what do I, I can't just go all attack. I gotta go defense too.
[893.72s -> 899.08s]  This is HP. There we go. Look at that 1200, 1300, 1415. Let's just put all 500 in here.
[899.08s -> 907.27s]  So I have a 500 cap of energy. By the way, for every resident sleeper that I see in the chat,
[907.27s -> 923.74s]  it adds one minute to how long we're going to play this. I'm tracking them too. That's at least 280
[923.74s -> 927.22s]  minutes. The shit, this is the best song. This is the best song in the whole, the best song
[927.22s -> 942.71s]  of the whole soundtrack. Levels gained to this defense skill will decrease the amount of energy
[942.71s -> 947.27s]  needed to cap leveling speed upon rebirth. So rebirth is you, you prestige like Call of Duty.
[947.27s -> 959.70s]  Call of Duty stole everything they know from NGU. All right, I almost have a million HP. All right,
[959.70s -> 966.58s]  I have 626 block points. Look at the millions of HP. All right, we're going to do 250, 250.
[967.64s -> 977.42s]  Fight the boss. Here we go. Why am I hurt? Why am I already injured? How much HP do I have?
[978.06s -> 990.74s]  How did I get hurt? Why am I getting hurt? What's hurting me? Wait, I need to read this. You
[990.74s -> 995.38s]  shakily get to your feet, leaning against the wall for support. You have to build up your strength
[995.38s -> 999.62s]  somehow. From the corner of your eye, you spot a small piece of fluff. This will be your first and
[999.62s -> 1006.18s]  most intense battle of your life. 50,000 attack. I got a million. I got a million. Get out of here.
[1007.38s -> 1011.14s]  Oh, you squished the fluff. In more important news, that's a fantastic sandwich.
[1011.14s -> 1014.50s]  Smoked ham and turkey with swiss cheese and honey dijon. That's a pretty good sandwich.
[1015.38s -> 1020.10s]  Oh, hey, cool. You squished the fluff. In more important news, this is a fantastic sandwich.
[1021.06s -> 1024.82s]  Smoked ham and turkey with swiss cheese and honey dijon sauce on a ciabatta bun.
[1026.55s -> 1032.41s]  That's really fucking good. I'm actually kind of jealous about that. All right.
[1033.13s -> 1036.78s]  Uh, cool. Killing bosses brings a few important rewards. First off, you gain...
[1039.24s -> 1045.00s]  I'm getting vroomed by the LST. First of all, you gain experience. Experience points.
[1047.19s -> 1052.71s]  Turn that down for just a second. Just turn it down a little. Okay, you gain experience points
[1053.35s -> 1057.59s]  for downing bosses. EXP is used to buy permanent powers in the spend EXP menu,
[1057.59s -> 1061.35s]  which also you just unlocked. You should see a fancy yellow button in the bottom left.
[1062.58s -> 1068.50s]  Right there. Okay. Uh, all right. Uh, there's a lot of stuff you can buy with the EXP,
[1068.50s -> 1072.74s]  but don't get overwhelmed. My pro tip to you would be to buy the special offers to increase
[1072.74s -> 1080.46s]  the energy... I'm gonna burp. My pro tip to you would be to buy the special offers to increase
[1080.46s -> 1085.98s]  the speed the energy bar fills. I did specifically code them for newbies like you to buy, but no
[1085.98s -> 1090.62s]  pressure. Defeat the next couple bosses and I'll bug you again. 4G over and up. You got it.
[1091.91s -> 1101.86s]  Oh lord. All right. Total energy speed. Buying this will make the energy bar fill up faster,
[1101.86s -> 1112.71s]  which is this. Max speed is one bar fill per tick or 50 fills a second. Note, the bar fills
[1112.71s -> 1121.69s]  at a rate of 50 divided by energy speed. Ticks per fill rounded up. Later on, you'll want to
[1121.69s -> 1129.74s]  buy this upgrade in chunks such as 25 equals is greater than 50 speed in order to gain any effect.
[1129.74s -> 1132.78s]  All right. Newbie offers. That's what I'm looking for. What I got? Two experience
[1135.82s -> 1146.20s]  plus 0.3 for two experience points. Let's do it. Look at that. Max energy on... Max energy
[1146.20s -> 1156.62s]  on this rebirth is capped at 500. On rebirth, you will have 529 energy. All righty. Look
[1156.62s -> 1162.33s]  at how much fucking HP I have. Okay. I'm going to breeze through the newbie zones. All right.
[1162.33s -> 1166.41s]  Your current energy speed is 1.3, meaning the bar fills every 39 ticks. Next speed increases at
[1166.41s -> 1172.15s]  1.3 energy speed. Tap R to reclaim energy for a moment. Okay. Let's go. Oh yeah. Look at this.
[1172.15s -> 1177.93s]  I'm just completely allocating. Let's go kick some ass. Boss fight. Floating piece of shit.
[1177.93s -> 1183.99s]  You're sure that it's a fluff could... If the fluff could it... If the fluff could, comma,
[1183.99s -> 1188.30s]  it would give a dramatic death speech, but alas, you kick it off to the side.
[1188.30s -> 1193.13s]  More confident in your strength. What other inanimate objects are there to murder? A piece
[1193.13s -> 1200.12s]  of sewage as if my cube begins floating down the water right in front of you. Get fucking
[1200.12s -> 1212.34s]  instakilled. Boss fight. A stick. The sewage retreats from your onslaught of attacks. Either
[1212.34s -> 1216.02s]  that or it kept floating by. Probably your attacks though. You feel like you can manage
[1216.02s -> 1221.21s]  to make your way out of here now, but a weapon would be handy. Oh hey, is that a stick coming
[1221.21s -> 1232.01s]  down the water? Instakill it please. Oh, wait a minute. All right. A small mouse. As you turn
[1232.09s -> 1237.02s]  to head, as you turn to head to this room's exit, you notice a brown little mouse. In a
[1237.02s -> 1247.14s]  shrill voice, it squeaks. Welcome to NGU Idol. I'm Tippy. If you're all right, Ed. Eddie. If
[1247.14s -> 1252.70s]  you're all right, Ed. Oh, I don't think we can do that, Eddie. Turning out this annoying mouse's
[1252.70s -> 1259.64s]  intro, you're hit with a jolt of memory. I need to defeat every foe in your path. No matter what.
[1259.64s -> 1264.60s]  You can start with this mouse right here. What's he got? 11 million HP. I got 25 million. You got
[1264.60s -> 1276.74s]  nothing on me. Attack 1.1 million. Defense 3.1. Let's go. See you later. Oh, hi. Hello. It's 4G
[1276.74s -> 1281.40s]  again. So you killed the mouse. I guess that means it's time to add some rockin' new gameplay your
[1281.40s -> 1288.22s]  way. First off, you unlocked Adventure. Think crappy RPG within the game. You'll fight stuff
[1288.22s -> 1293.93s]  and loot other stuff. The training skills you unlock become moves you can use in Adventure to
[1293.93s -> 1299.85s]  defeat enemies. Oh, shit. What do you know about that? Enemies will spawn randomly every few
[1299.85s -> 1304.01s]  seconds when you move out of the safe zone. Fighting enemies in Adventure will drop gear,
[1304.01s -> 1307.83s]  which you can equip in the snazzy new... By the way, this game's free. I need to make that very
[1307.83s -> 1314.01s]  clear. You can just go get it right now on Steam. Or play it on a congregate, I believe. You just
[1314.01s -> 1320.33s]  play it. Fucking free. Who knows if they make you buy stuff. I don't know. Somebody just said
[1320.33s -> 1334.09s]  It Better Be. What? Come on. This is fucking... This is a classic. This is a classic game,
[1334.65s -> 1340.14s]  and I am offended that you just said that. This game's been around for like five years.
[1340.14s -> 1345.45s]  It's back before you even... That's back before you even were born. You were in diapers when this
[1345.45s -> 1350.49s]  guy 4G was making this shit. Like 15 years ago when he rode it on the back of a napkin.
[1351.05s -> 1360.68s]  This is vintage. All hand-drawn. All right. Enemies... They drop gear. There's gear in this
[1360.68s -> 1366.95s]  game. There's hats in this game. That just made everybody like it. All right. You have a new...
[1366.95s -> 1371.48s]  It's an inventory slot now. You don't have shit we're gonna have to take care of. Equipment can
[1372.44s -> 1376.76s]  boost your stats in Adventure and your main attack defense stats and later provide special
[1376.76s -> 1382.04s]  awesome bonuses. You only have the training zone unlocked. Defeating higher numbered bosses will
[1382.04s -> 1387.08s]  eventually unlock new Adventure zones to play in and get better gear to slap on. Also, boss enemies
[1387.08s -> 1391.88s]  in Adventure have a chance to drop experience. Experience is good. You've also unlocked rebirths,
[1391.88s -> 1397.42s]  which needs some explanation. I already know what this does because I sat there for an hour and a
[1397.42s -> 1407.13s]  half. Streamer in chat. Eventually you're going to hit a point... By the way, I'm sorry. I want to
[1407.13s -> 1413.74s]  count how many resident sleepers there were. There were exactly 1412. So that's 1412 minutes
[1413.74s -> 1423.24s]  added to the stream. Divided by 40. So it was like 30 minutes. Eventually you're going to hit a point
[1423.24s -> 1426.92s]  where it takes forever to grow stronger. If you rebirth, you'll reset most of your progress in
[1426.92s -> 1433.26s]  each menu and the bosses will reset. However, in return your number will grow. Number is, well,
[1433.26s -> 1440.14s]  it's a number. Your attack and defense get multiplied by number and your number can get
[1440.14s -> 1448.70s]  ridiculously big. Like stupid big. Like past your mama jokes big. So anytime progress feels slow,
[1448.70s -> 1452.30s]  it's probably time to rebirth and reset some progress to get your number up. You can try
[1452.30s -> 1457.42s]  rebirthing now if you want, but if you wait longer, your number will even grow even bigger.
[1457.42s -> 1463.67s]  Rebirth time is a big factor to decide the size of your number up until 60 minutes. I should have
[1463.67s -> 1467.59s]  just rebirthed at the very beginning. You can check how long your rebirth has been going on in the
[1467.59s -> 1473.82s]  stats menu. Cool. When you rebirth, bosses also respond with a higher number. With a high enough
[1473.82s -> 1478.06s]  number, you can defeat the high numbered bosses, which will reward experience every time they
[1478.06s -> 1487.21s]  defeat. Get to boss 17 and you'll unlock another thing. See you. All right. 65 million HP, 4 million.
[1487.21s -> 1493.19s]  What do you got for defense? Let's, uh oh. Wiping the mouse guts from between your fingers,
[1493.19s -> 1496.07s]  you head off down the sewers and make your escape. Barely rounding the second corner,
[1496.07s -> 1505.50s]  you face your next major foe, a slightly bigger mouse. You know what to do. What do I got for attack?
[1505.50s -> 1514.44s]  Uh, I think, I think I'm going to win. I should still win. I'm not going to run.
[1514.44s -> 1518.84s]  Nuke. No, I don't nuke. Click this button to blast through all those scrub bosses that you can
[1518.84s -> 1524.55s]  annihilate with a flick of your fingers. Your wrist will thank me later. I don't want to do that.
[1524.55s -> 1530.44s]  What do you mean I can't win? I just, I just destroyed it. How much experience do I have?
[1530.44s -> 1543.08s]  No, my defense is going up by the million. Uh oh. You start feeling lost in the identical looking
[1543.08s -> 1550.28s]  passageways, dripping with all sorts of goopy brown waste. This is just a shit stream. This
[1550.28s -> 1555.08s]  is a poo stream, I guess. You're worrying that you'll never escape these sewers and that every
[1555.08s -> 1559.32s]  bossy face is just going to be some variation of a rat. Cutting off your nose is starting to
[1559.32s -> 1569.51s]  seem like a good idea too. The stink. 325 million HP, 32 million attack. Okay, don't die. That was
[1569.51s -> 1583.56s]  close. Uh, what do I have to inventory? Oh god. Item list. This has like the same amount of items
[1583.56s -> 1593.61s]  as Binding of Isaac does. All right, basic training. I only have 500. Okay, I have to go back. I think
[1593.61s -> 1607.78s]  I have to rebirth. I have 20 experience points to spend. No, I can't do it. Adventure. Okay,
[1607.78s -> 1617.30s]  safe zone. Awakening. I only have, all I can do is block. Blocks 50% of incoming damage for the next
[1617.30s -> 1634.10s]  three seconds. I don't even have an attack. All right, let's go. Tutorial zone. Idle mode. Click
[1634.10s -> 1638.10s]  to toggle idle mode on and off. When on, a stick has attacked. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1639.62s -> 1644.42s]  Automatically attacks every one second while on health regen. All right, let's turn it on.
[1645.14s -> 1654.26s]  Where's my actual, I can't attack? All right, I'm gonna beat the stick. HP rag up. One eight, one,
[1654.26s -> 1659.14s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. When on, automatically attacks every one second. You get
[1659.14s -> 1664.10s]  20% health regen. Cannot use any other moves. Damage multiplier of 1.2. Fighting a stick again.
[1664.82s -> 1669.83s]  I don't have any manual attacks yet. Oh, okay. What happens if I get to zero HP? Does the game end?
[1673.24s -> 1685.90s]  Uh oh. Uh, I don't think I'm gonna do this. I think I'm gonna lose. I'm gonna die. He's doing
[1685.90s -> 1692.31s]  too much damage. I need like a health potion. I'm dead. A small mouse has defeated you. I lost.
[1695.59s -> 1703.38s]  Well, all right, I got, hold on. This is a different game mode entirely. What do I have? 65
[1703.38s -> 1720.31s]  million? Requires 5,000 levels in attack to level this up. Equipment, okay. Use the boost you find
[1720.31s -> 1727.51s]  to improve. This is 4G's merge and boost tutorial cube. Level 4 accessory. Use the boost you find
[1727.51s -> 1732.47s]  to improve this item's stats. Find additional cubes and drag onto this item to merge and
[1732.47s -> 1743.38s]  increase stat caps by 1% per level rounded down. One. Oh, shit. There it is. I hope to God it really
[1743.38s -> 1749.43s]  is just a stick. A level 10 weapon. Merge extra copies of the stick onto this item to raise its
[1749.43s -> 1755.03s]  level. Each level increases an equipment's max stats by 1% rounded down, up to double the original
[1755.03s -> 1767.78s]  stats at level 100. You can do this a fucking hundred times? Oh, shit. So what does this do?
[1767.78s -> 1776.20s]  Power boost? Drag this item onto any equipment. Wait. To raise its stat by 1. Raising equipment's
[1776.20s -> 1782.55s]  current stat to its cap to really toughness boost. Oh, shit. I can put this on a stick.
[1782.55s -> 1788.52s]  Don't waste it. Don't waste it. Should I not waste it? Oh, it's on max power. All right, yeah.
[1788.52s -> 1794.07s]  Fuck it. I'm not gonna waste these. All right, cool. Let's go back to adventure and see what
[1794.07s -> 1801.27s]  happens. Let's see if we can fight that motherfucker again. Now I got a stick. 13 power. Let's go.
[1801.59s -> 1815.94s]  There it is. Yeah, you ain't gonna win. I got it. I got this one. This is the train level,
[1815.94s -> 1827.02s]  if you didn't ever play this. Drop 952 gold. Drop the cloth hat. Oh, yes. Wait, what? Hold on.
[1827.02s -> 1839.93s]  I'm gonna lose. Hold on a second. Regular cloth hat worn out and tattered, but at least it feels
[1839.93s -> 1847.91s]  soft. Merge extra copies so I get one toughness and some health regen. Stats breakdown. Oh,
[1847.91s -> 1855.69s]  look at all this shit. To satify all the stats nerds. I have so much. I gotta wait. Hold on.
[1855.69s -> 1864.74s]  Should I um, all right. Adventure. Wait, is this at three to three? One on one. Fight boss. Can I
[1864.74s -> 1870.90s]  do anything about this yet? No. This is the wall right now. Click on the special prize. Special
[1870.90s -> 1876.73s]  prize. Special prize. Hold on. I got a lot of experience. Should I? Is this gonna reset if I
[1876.73s -> 1889.00s]  rebirth? You're playing an accounting game. Yeah. Oh, fuck. This is going to fire. All right. Wait,
[1889.00s -> 1896.47s]  wait, wait. 16. Total energy power. Let's do that one. Bang. 1.1. Energy power. It means
[1896.47s -> 1900.95s]  things do better. I have numbers to go up. That's all I need to know. Wait, wait. There's adventure
[1900.95s -> 1913.69s]  stats. Oh, shit. Adventure special. More inventory spaces. Fuck. Levels gained in... Wait a minute.
[1913.69s -> 1917.35s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Levels gained in this attack skill would decrease the
[1917.35s -> 1922.47s]  amount of energy needed to cap leveling speed upon rebirth. Base attack received per level is a
[1922.47s -> 1931.96s]  thousand. Oh, let's get this fucking thing leveled up then. You're going to get this game? Yeah,
[1931.96s -> 1938.89s]  dude. If you like numbers going up, then you might as well get it. Look, this is very clear
[1938.89s -> 1946.76s]  what this stream is. Title even says it. Let's split this. I need some more. Hold on. Let's
[1947.96s -> 1956.38s]  do like increments of a hundred. Let's do like a hundred, a hundred, like three hundred.
[1956.38s -> 1963.93s]  Because I need more defense and HP. Is this a clicker? This is not really. It's more of a
[1963.93s -> 1973.74s]  management game. No, I can't fight this thing. I think I should rebirth. I'm going to do it.
[1974.38s -> 1983.29s]  Let's go back to adventure. All right, so now I should have... Let me try this one more time.
[1986.07s -> 2001.66s]  Idle mode. Floating sewage. I feel like I've given up on you. What, because I'm playing an idle game?
[2007.10s -> 2012.30s]  What the fuck does that mean? There was just a carnival last weekend.
[2013.66s -> 2030.82s]  Huh? What the fuck? You just increased the amount of time I'm going to play this game by 30 minutes.
[2031.54s -> 2066.36s]  You or yourself? We're stuck here forever. Quick, quick call the game boring so he adds time. That's
[2066.36s -> 2078.25s]  the fucking 500 IQ play. All right, what do we got? Boss battle. Boss battle. I can't do it.
[2085.16s -> 2094.54s]  I'm going to rebirth here in a second. All right, hold on. I got some stuff. Oh, fuck. There's like
[2094.54s -> 2099.59s]  four sausages now. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. If I drag these on top of each other,
[2099.59s -> 2113.10s]  this has been merged. Does that do anything? Oh, he's playing a clicker game. Does he even
[2113.10s -> 2146.44s]  care anymore? Yeah, he does. Oh, shit. Okay. Three out of four power. Guys, I think he hates us all
[2146.44s -> 2167.78s]  on a personal level. I'm personally offending all 3,700 of you. We just did a carnival stream
[2167.78s -> 2172.90s]  like a week and a half ago. I think I'm entitled to one cookie clicker stream.
[2173.86s -> 2199.61s]  Uh, thank you Hurricane Turtle for the 10 community subs. Appreciate it. Put on the stick.
[2199.61s -> 2205.67s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Level 65 weapon. Wait, wait, wait. I didn't even look at
[2205.67s -> 2212.95s]  this shit. All right, you just add in another hour. Uh, there's no bottom zone. These are all worn
[2212.95s -> 2223.75s]  out. Kind of ruins the purpose of these boots, doesn't it? Toughness one. Toughness one. I'm just
[2223.75s -> 2246.89s]  the dirty guy that fell in the sewer. Holy shit, I'm doing great. I'm going to move 69. Uh, can I go
[2246.97s -> 2254.66s]  to- I want to go to a different zone. How do I open up a new zone? Cloth shirt. Oh, fuck,
[2254.66s -> 2262.74s]  I can merge these. I think I have to- I have to beat this. I'm not going to be able to do this.
[2273.56s -> 2278.01s]  All right, it's time to rebirth. Here we go. I'm doing it. It's been 30 minutes.
[2278.01s -> 2282.73s]  We're at the- all right, we're at the time. We're at the time here where I have to decide
[2282.73s -> 2294.63s]  if I'm going to play this for a while. And the answer is yes. Anything to do before rebirth.
[2295.43s -> 2311.16s]  Let's go. All right, we're back to zero. It's been 25 minutes. It's time to get off the toilet.
[2311.80s -> 2332.82s]  Give me a break. You just added an hour to the game. All right, 48,000 attack.
[2334.79s -> 2352.47s]  I only have a thousand HP. 500,000 HP? What? I need more. How much HP do I have?
[2352.47s -> 2358.81s]  All right, so I've rebirthed, which means I get way more per- I get more stats per point now,
[2358.81s -> 2368.02s]  and I have a higher energy cap. What if this was my first 24-hour stream? What if I did that?
[2368.82s -> 2384.02s]  Big mistake. What do you mean? What am I talking about? Look at this. Look at how fast that's going
[2384.02s -> 2389.85s]  up because- wait, I want to see the info. Where's the actual stats? That's going up so much faster.
[2395.35s -> 2405.67s]  Do it. Do it. Coward. Coward. Coward. Coward. All right, I got- uh, let's do it. Let's split it
[2405.67s -> 2412.44s]  evenly. 100, 100. I want more HP. All right, now let's just- let's just murder this guy.
[2413.24s -> 2438.42s]  Bring on the next one. Floating piece of shit. What you guys don't know is I have been on the
[2438.42s -> 2446.10s]  toilet this whole time. I'm in the bathroom. My whole setup is here. All right, 275. Let's do more
[2446.10s -> 2455.32s]  attack. I want this over like 5 million. Did you guys ever make magic potions? I think we already
[2455.32s -> 2472.63s]  talked about magic potions, right? No, I'm saying like in the sink. Did you guys have five- what,
[2472.63s -> 2479.93s]  65 million HP? I need some more. We're gonna- what do I got? Pretty dirty. I need more- uh,
[2479.93s -> 2486.41s]  I need more help. You guys ever did magic potions in the sink? You take like a- like a small squeeze
[2486.41s -> 2493.38s]  of shampoo, a little bit of toothpaste, some conditioner, a little bit of like spray deodorant
[2493.38s -> 2500.02s]  and- and mix it up and maybe made magic potions. If you say you didn't do that, I don't- I don't
[2500.02s -> 2507.61s]  believe you and you know what? You've just added 40 minutes to the spring. You see the goddamn
[2507.61s -> 2534.97s]  carnival I did two weeks ago? Add a timer. I don't have a timer. All right, I think I can do this.
[2536.10s -> 2548.23s]  Not yet. Can we get a BRB? How long has it been? We've been going for 43 minutes. By the way,
[2548.23s -> 2553.27s]  Turtles in Time has a long ass soundtrack. I didn't think it was this long. I thought it was like eight
[2553.27s -> 2563.96s]  minutes. It's been 28 minutes of this. 65 million. All right, I gotta get more. What do I got? What's
[2563.96s -> 2573.16s]  my new cap? You will hit your energy cap in one minute and 52 seconds. I need more HP or something.
[2573.16s -> 2588.70s]  What the fuck do I need? Attack. No, I want- I want like- I want 50 million HP and then we're
[2588.70s -> 2592.54s]  gonna go for an attack. What do I have for experience? Three experience points. I want to-
[2592.54s -> 2597.98s]  you know what? Let's make it better for adventure mode. I want more base power. Bingo. 14. That
[2597.98s -> 2610.68s]  should make it very easy. All right, 34 million. What's he got for defense? 3.5. I got a lot of
[2610.68s -> 2627.51s]  attack though. What do you think? Think I'm gonna do it? I think I'm gonna do it. All right, here we go.
[2627.51s -> 2641.18s]  This was the wall last time. Drain it of its lifeblood. That's what the plan is. Back to basic
[2641.26s -> 2648.30s]  training. Uh, get it all in attack actually. All of it. 615 cap. I went up by five. I went by 115.
[2648.86s -> 2654.55s]  Look at that. What's this guy got for defense? 17 million. Let's get to like 20 million attack
[2654.55s -> 2665.10s]  and I'm gonna put HP up. Experience? I don't have any EXP. I need to make the cap higher.
[2665.66s -> 2671.61s]  Once you have 100,000 max energy, you can- you'll find you can't gain anymore just by
[2671.61s -> 2679.67s]  generating energy. Why? Because I made it that way. All right, let's do adventure mode. Uh,
[2679.67s -> 2692.15s]  tutorial zone. How do we get out of the tutorial? Do you get experience every time you kill
[2692.15s -> 2696.62s]  something? I think so. All right, small mouse boss. So how do I get to the out of the zone?
[2698.98s -> 2704.90s]  He's still in the tutorial. Laugh out loud, MonkaS. Um, I need to tell you guys something very
[2704.90s -> 2713.22s]  important. This, uh, this game, some people have been continuously playing this game for three years.
[2714.18s -> 2725.29s]  So, uh, whoa. All right, any, uh, inventory? What do I got? Wait, I get to keep my stuff?
[2726.09s -> 2730.26s]  Oh shit, I'm getting like all these- hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna get overwhelmed
[2730.26s -> 2738.09s]  here. Sausage. Three out of five. All right, drag this onto any equipment to boost its special by
[2738.09s -> 2749.50s]  one. Should I boost this by one? Wait, is this by two? What'd I just do? I just boosted the one to a
[2749.58s -> 2762.90s]  one. What have I done? Uh, equip the cube. Oh fuck, I didn't know I could put this on. Wait,
[2762.90s -> 2768.46s]  so can I- should I put this all in the cube? I'm still picking up dirty socks.
[2772.39s -> 2785.19s]  All right, uh, hurricane turtle gave 20 community subs. I'm almost there. Level 87. I need to boost
[2785.19s -> 2794.79s]  this. Oh, I ran out of music. We might as well move on to Super Mario World OST from Super Nintendo.
[2794.79s -> 2816.78s]  We're in a Super Nintendo mood today. All right, uh, I got a level 100 weapon now. Three to six.
[2816.78s -> 2823.10s]  I can boost it if I wanted to. 100. All right, now- wait, I have 48 million attack. It's time to do
[2823.10s -> 2829.91s]  some, uh, I gotta get out. I gotta get over this. Basic training, get this out. Cap it. Let's go.
[2829.91s -> 2840.14s]  Spam that. Put every single point in this. I just want- I need like 300 million HP. How do I get more-
[2840.14s -> 2847.30s]  wait, I need to kill stuff. Adventure. Let's go. No, we're still in the tutorial. I get- I'm
[2847.30s -> 2859.78s]  getting out of the tutorial zone. At least he's dropping stuff. Where's my money? Cloth boots.
[2859.78s -> 2866.62s]  All right, you need to defeat boss seven in- wait, what? You need to defeat boss seven in the fight
[2866.62s -> 2878.34s]  boss menu. Oh, shit. I have to kill this. Holy fuck, I didn't realize how much attack I had.
[2878.34s -> 2890.57s]  I think it's gonna happen. He makes all the rooms. Well, he's dead. Brown slime. Boss seven. 162
[2890.57s -> 2895.78s]  million attack. That's- that's not good. Finally, you begin to feel a cool breeze from one path
[2895.78s -> 2901.70s]  and heading down it, you see a light at the end. Just before the exit, a large menacing brown blob
[2901.70s -> 2906.42s]  seeps out of the nearby walls, ready to fight. Well, it's as menacing as a blob of poo can get it.
[2906.42s -> 2913.56s]  That's poo. Okay, so what do you have for defense? I'm not gonna be able to kill this. I need to get
[2913.56s -> 2925.54s]  what I have to. Uh, more socks. I feel like I should- no. I'm stuck in this- I'm stuck here forever.
[2925.54s -> 2937.43s]  I'm just gonna grind gold. This- that- this is 1.6 billion HP. What do I have for defense? 37 million.
[2937.43s -> 2947.78s]  This is gonna kill me instantly. Yeah, like, this is impossible. This is not possible. Where's my-
[2947.78s -> 2962.71s]  do I have to rebirth again? Wait, experience. 3 exp. I- I'm gonna rebirth. All right, we're gonna
[2962.71s -> 2972.07s]  start over. What do I get for- I have 11 minutes of- of rebirth here. It's not possible, guys.
[2972.07s -> 2988.39s]  162 million attack. I only have- he'll- he kills me in two seconds. Or like three seconds. Is that
[2989.03s -> 3006.23s]  locked? Give the cube food. 9 out of 18 max health. This is for white boss. German the cube. German
[3006.23s -> 3017.91s]  the cube. The cube. The cube. Use the boosts you find to improve this item's stats and find additional
[3017.91s -> 3033.93s]  cubes and drag onto this item to merge and increase stack caps by 1% per level. Uh, how many times can
[3033.93s -> 3040.90s]  you- it's level 100. So how do I just throw stuff in the trash? Right here. Use numbers on cube.
[3040.90s -> 3054.60s]  Is that- should I do that? Everyone's gonna scream at me now. Special. Energy speed. 6 out of 15.
[3057.14s -> 3076.25s]  7%. 8%. Is this waste? 9% extra speed and 1 power. Toughness. Can this thing be merged with another
[3076.25s -> 3091.56s]  cube? Pants. Everyone screams. Pants. So I can do cube and another cube. All right, well I used it
[3091.56s -> 3098.01s]  all. So, let's see. I- I still have to beat this boss though. 500 million HP. Why is this not going
[3098.01s -> 3111.91s]  up? Oh, because I have- I'm only doing attack right now. Wait, what? Why am I capped out at HP?
[3111.91s -> 3131.90s]  Why am I capped out at HP? Wait, what the hell is this? Now it's going up. Why is it going up?
[3131.90s -> 3147.32s]  Attack is HP. What? All right, what do I have? 56 million. I can't even come close. Block scales up
[3147.32s -> 3166.20s]  regen. Is that all it does? Well, fuck. I didn't know that. How am I gonna ever hit through this?
[3166.20s -> 3173.82s]  Three experience. Let's do energy power. I need 15. Adventure stats. Adventure special. No,
[3173.82s -> 3185.75s]  this don't matter until I get- I have to beat the seven blocks. What's the cube got? 6 out of 21
[3185.75s -> 3197.06s]  max health. 5k per block. Why do I say power like that? Power? Power? Play adventure. I can't. You
[3197.06s -> 3201.70s]  need to defeat boss seven and the fight boss to move on. I can't leave the tutorial until I beat
[3201.70s -> 3218.25s]  this guy. I'm gonna have to rebirth. Power. What's wrong with saying power? How do you say it? Auto
[3218.25s -> 3229.83s]  merge, auto boost. Well, not yet. I want to see. Combined stick. It's not gonna do anything though.
[3229.83s -> 3246.12s]  Little 65 chest. Hurry the fuck up! Hurry the fuck up! Hurry the fuck up! All right, I'm good. 86
[3246.12s -> 3255.90s]  million. I need to get to defense. 87 million. Now I can- at least now I can hurt it. Kind of.
[3255.90s -> 3265.48s]  I'm gonna stay for the Mario music. Thanks for watching the stream. Appreciate it. You just added
[3265.48s -> 3283.77s]  15 more minutes. No, I can't. I don't have enough attack. Play a second idle game by playing this
[3283.77s -> 3295.38s]  one. No, I don't have the kind of brain power for that. I think I have to rebirth. After killing this
[3295.38s -> 3299.85s]  thing is the last thing I'm gonna do. And then I'm gonna rebirth and we're gonna do it again.
[3302.15s -> 3309.50s]  You just have to AFK. You don't need brain power. Says you. I need all the brain power I can get.
[3311.98s -> 3315.24s]  Regular attack. Oh, nice. Hold on.
[3328.84s -> 3339.46s]  What's base attack on this one? Base attack received per levels 150. Oh, well, uh, yeah.
[3340.34s -> 3354.92s]  I need to get- oh, defense. Right. I have to get to 5,000 defense. You're right. What do I got?
[3355.40s -> 3367.53s]  113 million. Ah, it's not there yet. It's almost there. Hurry up. You're invincible. I'm not
[3367.53s -> 3376.39s]  invincible. I'm very killable. Auto merge. Auto boost. Need to unlock auto boost. I can't even
[3376.39s -> 3387.45s]  toggle these. Need to buy auto merge in the EXP menu. I can't do this. I'm not allowed to auto
[3387.45s -> 3404.20s]  merge. I have to do it by hand. 115 million attack. Come on. Let's go. Damn it. I just need to kill
[3404.20s -> 3418.30s]  this guy. Stick can't go over a hundred. Yeah. What does the nuke button do? I believe the nuke
[3418.30s -> 3422.34s]  button- now somebody correct me if this is incorrect. I believe the nuke button means you
[3422.34s -> 3435.93s]  can skip whatever you're capable of killing. Right? Wrong. This is just wrong. Wrong. Incorrect. Nuke
[3435.93s -> 3445.67s]  just autocompletes easy bosses. That's exactly what I said. You're impatient in an idle game.
[3448.66s -> 3454.31s]  It skips to the next game. If I put on the face cam will you guys relax? I just want you guys to
[3454.31s -> 3463.69s]  relax. That's what this is. We're just relaxing. You guys just- you guys need to relax with me.
[3463.69s -> 3488.14s]  We're gonna get to 1.6 billion. Show auto. The numbers are getting too big.
[3489.40s -> 3497.26s]  A hundred million is not that big when it comes to space. There's space levels of numbers in this
[3497.26s -> 3510.09s]  game. All right. Here's what we're gonna do. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna keep playing this,
[3510.09s -> 3520.52s]  but I'm gonna play the lava game too. I'm gonna play them both at the same time. In between
[3520.52s -> 3533.45s]  levels I'm gonna switch because I want to do this. How much defense do I have? Unfortunately,
[3533.45s -> 3542.70s]  the music has to stop though. Uh-oh. Defensive buff. Base defense received isn't- ooh.
[3548.76s -> 3555.45s]  Shit. I want that- I want to spam that. Thousand per- thousand base defense. How much do I have
[3555.45s -> 3561.99s]  right now? Let me just kill this fucking thing. 162 million. All right. Let's go. It's gonna be
[3561.99s -> 3578.28s]  close. I'm gonna lose. Fuck. I need a little bit more. Almost- just a little bit more. I need more
[3578.28s -> 3586.15s]  attack. Defense is all right. I need more attack. Just only attack. Just get it up there. Come on.
[3586.15s -> 3603.22s]  Hurry up. Attack in HP. Is it? 107 defense. All right. Now let's only do defense. I'm just going
[3603.22s -> 3611.50s]  all in. You just- sometimes you have to go all in completely. You lied about face cam. No, I- I'm
[3611.50s -> 3627.22s]  moving to, um, hot lava. You regen faster. Oh shit. Holy shit, you're right. So you lied about face cam.
[3627.78s -> 3644.57s]  You really want me to put on face cam? Is that what you want? Let me kill this. Come on. Who's
[3644.57s -> 3651.48s]  going down faster? Who's counting down faster? Is it me or them? Oh, it's even. Completely.
[3652.20s -> 3673.59s]  Hurry up. How much is he regenning? All right. If I- I gotta regen over what you're regenning
[3673.59s -> 3697.85s]  and then go again. Put your face as the boss. Hold on. I'm- I'll- I'm- it's- I'm getting addicted.
[3698.49s -> 3717.78s]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Here it is. I did it. He's dead. We don't need to play another game.
[3717.78s -> 3722.74s]  I did it. You defeated brown slime. You've unlocked a new adventure zone, the sewers. Go to adventure
[3722.74s -> 3727.21s]  feature and check it out. I'm addicted. We don't need to play any other game. You finally escape,
[3727.21s -> 3731.45s]  gasping your first breaths of fresh air. And who knows how long. You shield your eyes for a moment
[3731.45s -> 3738.02s]  in the bright sun. Once your eyes adapt to the light, you see a gorgeous green field stretched out
[3738.58s -> 3743.72s]  before you, leading up to a forest. You can feel the gloom seeping into every branch. As you approach
[3743.72s -> 3748.12s]  the path leading to the forest, a spooky skeleton emerges from the ground, armed with a trumpet.
[3748.76s -> 3753.08s]  You try not to get distracted by its jazzy tunes while you smash it to dust. This thing is not
[3753.08s -> 3763.11s]  going to be killable now. But I did unlock an adventure zone. Oh my god. My inventory is a
[3763.11s -> 3772.38s]  mess. This is the same inventory that I have when I play Minecraft. I keep so much useless shit and
[3772.38s -> 3789.78s]  I have to merge all this. I don't even want these sticks anymore. I have to- no, I'm gonna- that's
[3789.78s -> 3796.02s]  the first thing I'm gonna buy. I'm gonna buy- oh. I'm gonna buy auto-merge immediately upon rebirth.
[3796.02s -> 3804.52s]  Are we almost maxed out? Four. All right, hold on. Adventure. Let's just- let's go to the sewers.
[3805.16s -> 3814.82s]  Let's check it out. I'm just sweeping. I'm absolutely stomping right now. 1800 gold. All
[3814.82s -> 3820.66s]  right. Hold on. I'll put on the face game in like a couple hours. I don't even know how to turn it on.
[3820.66s -> 3822.58s]  I'm using a new streamlabs. I have no idea.
[3829.90s -> 3843.48s]  Uh-oh, brown slime. We're gonna get some good gear from this one. All right, you guys get to pick.
[3843.48s -> 3853.62s]  We either play hot lava or you get a face cam. Which one do you want? 2900 gold. Nice. Big rat.
[3855.38s -> 3860.14s]  Both. Well, I'll end up doing both eventually here. This is- we're just doing the pre-stream.
[3860.86s -> 3867.90s]  Yeah, I think we're just doing the pre- stream. Guys, I just got off the plane from TwitchCon like
[3867.90s -> 3879.75s]  four days ago. I need- like I need- I need some time. I'm dead. Ooh, a new dirty shirt. Put it on.
[3880.31s -> 3886.82s]  Guys, I just got off the plane from San Diego like five days ago. Like, I'm fucking- I just need some
[3886.82s -> 3903.74s]  time. We just- we need to play an idle game for a little bit. All right, I lost. It's time to rebirth.
[3905.77s -> 3914.01s]  I think so. I'm doing it. Fuck it. I'm doing it. Uh, boss power bonus is going from two to the
[3914.01s -> 3919.93s]  seventh power, 128. Boss power bonus, last rebirth, two to the fifth power, 35. Current number number
[3919.93s -> 3927.98s]  on rebirth, 120. Time factor, training level factor. Nothing to need to do. Go ahead and rebirth.
[3931.21s -> 3939.77s]  Okay, I'm gonna have 121 times. Let's go. Difficulty normal. I ain't doing that. Rebirth. Bang. Did it.
[3939.77s -> 3947.69s]  Good. Nice. Nice. All right, I'll get you- do you deserve a face cam for that?
[3949.29s -> 3951.21s]  You do. It's gonna be real.
[3951.21s -> 3963.69s]  No. You deserve it. I'll give it to you. For like- for- all right, for every resident sleeper that
[3963.69s -> 3977.54s]  I see in the chat, I remove a minute from the face cam. What are you gonna do now? All right,
[3977.54s -> 3989.42s]  get this out of here. Let's just change categories into just chatting now and just
[3989.42s -> 3996.71s]  do an ask me anything. Right? Like, how big- okay, I can be like this big. Oh shit, I could be- I
[3996.71s -> 4010.74s]  could be- I could be this big right now on stream. That's a good track. All right, what's next? I
[4010.90s -> 4015.70s]  rebirthed. So we're gonna do basic training. I got my- let's go back to the live view.
[4020.39s -> 4035.83s]  Star Wars! All right, the cap. I'll have to redo this again. No, don't. I'll knock something off.
[4035.83s -> 4041.77s]  I'll break something. Do I fucking love Star Wars? This is not gonna go the way that you think.
[4042.49s -> 4052.06s]  This is like the best song in the whole entire fucking Mario catalog of songs.
[4055.26s -> 4060.86s]  All right, 10 million attack. Need gold. Get loads of gold to unlock this. More unlockables!
[4064.89s -> 4073.93s]  Let's just, uh, fight boss. Should I just nuke? I mean, I'm at 18 million attack. Should we just
[4073.93s -> 4081.05s]  snap all these guys out of here? Oh shit, I can't be this big. I can't be this big. You
[4081.05s -> 4097.66s]  can't see the health bar. Gotta have to shrink it. I can't be here either. I can't know, because
[4097.66s -> 4101.02s]  the- look at what- look what happens if I do that. That fucks this whole thing up.
[4101.82s -> 4115.78s]  That fucks up the whole thing. God damn it. I can't. I can't do it. This- I- it's too much-
[4117.82s -> 4120.94s]  Nope, I can't do it. I was gonna get hurt and have that song play right now.
[4121.98s -> 4126.34s]  This thing. I was trying- I was like, what is over here that I could get hurt with?
[4127.06s -> 4134.62s]  I don't even know where it is. Here it is. This guy- I was gonna have like something fall and
[4134.62s -> 4139.91s]  like drop and hit me in the head, like lean on and be like, oh no. What happened? Oh shit!
[4139.91s -> 4155.96s]  Oh, he- he got hurt! And he died! He took a hurt. Yeah, it was made out of fucking Play-Doh.
[4155.96s -> 4165.46s]  All right, let's go back to the song. All right, what was I doing? Good idea, poor execution.
[4165.46s -> 4167.94s]  You sometimes you think of something that you want to do, and then like,
[4170.30s -> 4176.36s]  I think 15 seconds go by and you're like, wait a minute. I want to do that. And then you don't.
[4176.36s -> 4185.46s]  That's not right. Nuke everybody. I only have 20,000 HP. Oh, fuck. Wait, why is this so low?
[4187.48s -> 4201.08s]  But it's- it's really low for me. What did I do? Oh, that's why. Because my headphones got like
[4201.08s -> 4212.25s]  unplugged. Okay, now that's better. All right, I need to go- I need to exp- oh wait, back to
[4212.25s -> 4224.38s]  training. What's 570's cap? Let's get it at 317. There we go. Now you can't hear it. Yeah, you can.
[4224.38s -> 4234.70s]  That's fine. You can hear that. What does sour please mean? It means dance. It's like a I'm dancing
[4234.70s -> 4248.79s]  thing. I don't know. I just learned about that like two or three months ago, so. You can't lie,
[4248.79s -> 4254.97s]  this idle game has a really good soundtrack. I mean, it does. It does. It's a pretty good soundtrack.
[4254.97s -> 4260.98s]  Nuke this guy. All right, that's pretty cool that you can do that. Uh, I have to fight the mouse,
[4260.98s -> 4273.22s]  though. Six- we're over the cap right now. That's good. Put this over. Fix the face cam location.
[4278.10s -> 4282.42s]  Isn't that- isn't this way- you wanted it? I thought it was supposed to be right here.
[4282.98s -> 4292.09s]  Is it- it's not fine there? It should be. I mean, you can't see how much energy is being
[4292.73s -> 4301.91s]  allocated. Put it over here. What about- there's nowhere for it to go. Come on, let me show you.
[4301.91s -> 4311.90s]  What if it was down here? That's not a bad place for it. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. You- I
[4311.90s -> 4315.72s]  want to see the artwork. Did you guys want to see- it's not gonna be my face for every single boss.
[4316.52s -> 4330.66s]  I'm sorry. Come on. Okay, I have- let's get rid of- okay, that was instant. I don't want to hurt my
[4330.66s -> 4340.86s]  eyes. Gone. All right, this is why you rebirth. How much experience do I have? 10. I want energy
[4340.86s -> 4345.90s]  power. This upgrade improves the effectiveness of your allocated energy. This means faster progress
[4345.90s -> 4362.41s]  on features while using less energy. I don't- I have enough. I love this game. I'm playing it right
[4362.41s -> 4378.68s]  now. Thanks. Why'd I say thanks? Like, oh, thanks. Yeah, I like this too. Thanks. I don't know. I
[4378.68s -> 4385.80s]  have no idea. I'm gonna do that. Should I do more base energy speed? I don't think that's- that's
[4385.80s -> 4397.26s]  not doing- hmm. You know what? We're going all in on attack for now. Pull this all out. Cap the whole
[4397.26s -> 4407.86s]  thing. 778 points. Fight the boss. Boom. Just- you know how long this took last time? This was such
[4407.86s -> 4416.30s]  a fucking pain in the ass last time, and now we're at the skeleton trumpet. Although I have to wait
[4416.30s -> 4425.91s]  for this one. Time for adventure mode. What do I have for inventory? Okay, this is unchanged.
[4426.79s -> 4438.73s]  Adventure. Sewers. Let's go. Put on the Doom Eternal OST. The actual dev is here.
[4440.89s -> 4447.72s]  Actual dev in chat. This game's fucking fun. I'm already addicted. I- I didn't know if I- you know,
[4447.72s -> 4450.60s]  I- I crossed a path where I didn't think I was gonna get addicted. I wasn't sure.
[4451.85s -> 4465.70s]  And everyone here is addicted too. So that's what- this is what we're doing. Let's get some
[4465.70s -> 4475.50s]  Skyrim OST on here. I think that fits. Uh, do I have any inventory? Ooh, what's this? Crappy
[4475.50s -> 4483.35s]  helmet level four. One out of five. And better health regen. Oh, get this out of here. That's
[4483.35s -> 4487.11s]  much better. Throw it away. Wait, should I throw this away? I'm gonna hold on to it. Throw it away.
[4487.83s -> 4501.53s]  All right, we got 2.5- uh, 800 million attack. Basic training. Let's go back here. Oh, I'm just
[4501.53s -> 4517.13s]  stomping in here. That's fine. Level every item to 100. I'll- I'll give it a try. I do want more- I
[4517.13s -> 4522.50s]  need more defense. I'm gonna get- let me get this to 5,000 first. And then I'm gonna put 100 points.
[4522.50s -> 4534.02s]  Wait, listen. 100 points are gonna go here. And then 670 are gonna go down here. I think that's
[4534.02s -> 4541.94s]  a good idea. Once an item gets to level 100, you need to start putting the boosts into them.
[4544.12s -> 4563.72s]  Fuck, okay. German. Okay, um, why is the block not going up? Because I don't have any energy in it.
[4563.72s -> 4567.48s]  I'm just trying to spam this until I get to a point where I'm gonna bring it down. Because one
[4569.19s -> 4577.13s]  level of idle attack is worth 150. One level of regular attack is worth a thousand.
[4577.77s -> 4581.82s]  So that's how you play the math there. Let's spam this one now.
[4582.86s -> 4589.54s]  678. Spam it. Wait, cap. So that's the high- that's as fast as it can possibly go.
[4590.87s -> 4602.81s]  So 549 is as fast as I can do it. I think I broke it. Did I break it? Because when I do- all right,
[4602.81s -> 4608.74s]  for instance, ready? Like, cap. Like, cap seems to be different. Like, why is it different?
[4612.58s -> 4615.94s]  Cap just puts all your idle energy into it. All right, well let's do this for a little bit. I got
[4615.94s -> 4623.38s]  1.2 billion attack. Fight the boss. He's got 8.1 billion HP. He's got 4.37.500 million.
[4624.02s -> 4630.36s]  He's dead. I think I can ride it out. I think I can ride it out. Skeleton's about to go down.
[4632.14s -> 4635.66s]  Boys and girls, Skeleton's about to go down. Can I get you some hype in the chat, please?
[4635.66s -> 4650.46s]  I need to fucking think about it. Goblin. Seek out the wizard further on. You hear sighing from the
[4650.46s -> 4657.02s]  pulverized bone dust. Now swept away by the wind you venture past. Thankful for the advice. Though
[4657.02s -> 4663.10s]  unsure where to go other than deeper into this rather sinister looking forest. Before long you
[4663.10s -> 4668.38s]  sense something above you and dart out of the way just before a tiny hawk marked figure falls
[4668.38s -> 4675.02s]  onto the ground where you were. Uh-oh. Droop's in trouble. The goblin shrieks in a gross nasally
[4675.02s -> 4686.95s]  voice. The face game needs to be moved back. I can read that to you. It's okay. So he's got 4.- 4
[4686.95s -> 4701.06s]  billion. 2- 40 billion HP. 40 billion HP. Okay. I love how that's just a what the fuck do I do
[4701.06s -> 4709.10s]  button. I need to get more shit in the adventure mode. Back to the sewers. Let's go. Idle mode.
[4709.74s -> 4719.46s]  Activate it. Small mouse. Face game would be better in the bottom right. This is the bottom
[4719.46s -> 4731.51s]  right. All right. Bronze slime. He's got poison. Two poison damage. No, bottom left. I need- I want
[4731.51s -> 4744.18s]  some more coffee. Should I go get some more coffee? Ooh, I got a cracked amulet. Wait. Cracked
[4744.18s -> 4751.98s]  amulet. I need to see what that does. This one isn't covered in poo. This is a bunch of poo,
[4751.98s -> 4758.66s]  but it's brown anyways. Feels like the useful in combat. That's pretty good. That's actually
[4758.66s -> 4768.54s]  really good. What am I doing in my training here? Yeah, that's good. Just keep that. You know what?
[4768.54s -> 4775.03s]  Do this. Just to keep this kind of even here. I ignored subs. I didn't see them. Where are they?
[4780.23s -> 4786.42s]  What is this game actually called? It's called N-G-U-Idle. It's on Steam. It's free to play.
[4787.30s -> 4800.54s]  Did I miss subs? Did I? I- I don't see them. How many? How many were there? Because they're not
[4800.54s -> 4811.67s]  here. The dev gifted subs. It was 10? Why is this not here? Parag- Paraguay just gave 10 community
[4811.67s -> 4819.99s]  subs. That was 10 from- that was 10 from before too. That's 20. So that's the dev of this game.
[4820.63s -> 4832.31s]  I need that confirmed by- by somebody. I need that to be confirmed. Yes. What's going on?
[4834.49s -> 4841.38s]  That's all I have to say. Hey, what's up? Cool game. But thank you for the 20 community subs.
[4841.38s -> 4850.86s]  That means a lot. It's an interesting concept. It's a fun game. I'm liking it. Let's keep this
[4850.86s -> 4859.61s]  down here now. And then right after that, DemonsB gave 5,500 bits and they said,
[4860.78s -> 4864.94s]  I have chronic pain and watching your streams helps take my mind off of it.
[4864.94s -> 4870.38s]  I was enjoying part two of your recetteer VOD when about now I was in you leaned into the mic
[4870.38s -> 4875.58s]  and loudly said, wake up if you're sleeping, wake up and turn off the stream. You then loudly yelled
[4875.58s -> 4880.62s]  over some silly little bullshit in the anime game. Why? What the heck dude? Love you anyways.
[4881.98s -> 4887.56s]  I think you're really talented. But I'm really sorry to hear about the first part here. This-
[4887.56s -> 4891.08s]  the chronic pain. I can't imagine how much that must suck.
[4891.80s -> 4900.34s]  As somebody that also deals with chronic illness, it's not fun. So I know what that's like. Thank
[4900.34s -> 4906.68s]  you for the 5,500 fucking bits. And sorry for waking you up, but sometimes you gotta wake people
[4906.68s -> 4912.31s]  up. Like for instance, right now, we've been streaming for an hour and 25 minutes. And I know
[4912.31s -> 4915.67s]  for a fact that there's, let's say there's 40, almost 4,500 people there. I know at least a
[4915.67s -> 4921.37s]  thousand people fell asleep. So I have to wake them up and in probably the best possible way,
[4921.37s -> 4929.67s]  I think. Dude, what the fuck? No fucking way. No fucking way. It's free money coming through
[4929.67s -> 4934.90s]  right now. The screen. You just have to click the screen. It says it's free money there. No way.
[4934.90s -> 4947.80s]  No fucking way. I just got a hundred dollars. I just got $200. You gotta be kidding me. Welcome
[4947.80s -> 4956.23s]  back. What's this? What's this message today? Hey, Jeremiah, I just had a weird dream that like you
[4956.31s -> 4963.32s]  screaming in the mic about free money and stuff. That's weird. Welcome back though. If you were
[4963.32s -> 4975.11s]  sleeping. That's weird. Free? Like free? What do you mean free money? That's odd. I hope you had a
[4975.11s -> 4989.27s]  good nap, I guess. So what do we got? Let's go fight boss. 40 billion, 13 billion. What do you
[4989.27s -> 4994.39s]  got for attack? 1.3 billion. Defense, 2 billion. This ain't gonna work out. We're gonna go to
[4994.39s -> 4998.71s]  adventure mode. What do I got for my inventory? Not gonna work out. I need more gold. How much
[4998.71s -> 5008.23s]  gold do I have? That's not gonna work out either. Time to rebirth. I need something. There's nothing
[5008.23s -> 5022.46s]  in this. There is nothing in this container. Hello? Nobody in there. I need to refill that.
[5022.46s -> 5037.67s]  Wait. Also drop 4G's merge and boost tutorial cube. All right. So if I put these together,
[5037.67s -> 5060.63s]  what happens? Uh oh. That was a mistake. All right. Let's go. Sewers. More loot. More idle
[5060.63s -> 5067.40s]  equipment. You've ruined it. Reset. I can rebirth in like 15 minutes. Increases the cap of all the
[5067.40s -> 5074.31s]  skills. That's, that's all right. That's cool. Got 1800 gold. How much gold do I need? Do I need
[5075.34s -> 5092.12s]  change the fucking music? Hold on. Hey, we'll put on, how about like peaceful piano music?
[5237.10s -> 5242.22s]  I just had a fucking craze. Colonel Sanders was just chasing me in a fucking pool with a chainsaw.
[5242.22s -> 5250.02s]  I was trying to swim the fuck away. He was behind me with a fucking chainsaw.
[5250.74s -> 5264.98s]  It like stuck it through my chest. Well, did I make it? It's been seven, seven and a half hours.
[5264.98s -> 5296.17s]  Did I do it? I did it. No, not quite. Not quite there yet. Not there. Another 45 minutes. He's
[5296.17s -> 5314.36s]  wearing lipstick. Why did this happen? This is fucking scary. He's got, he's got white walker eyes.
[5319.18s -> 5375.00s]  Hold on a second. It's trying to correct it, is what it's doing. It's on auto and it's correcting
[5375.00s -> 5392.26s]  it. It's like patient zero. This is like the part of the movie where they like, I was an actor in
[5392.26s -> 5397.77s]  the movie, right? And over the course of maybe like 30, 40 minutes, I'm like, I'm like the funny guy
[5397.77s -> 5402.57s]  and the funny character that's in the zombie apocalypse movie. And I start getting sick.
[5404.46s -> 5410.22s]  And after, you know, I go, I go get quarantined in like the fucking shop behind us.
[5411.02s -> 5418.06s]  And this, I'm the first person to turn. And it's like, oh no, not the funny guy. Not the guy that
[5418.06s -> 5424.18s]  was making all those funny jokes during the whole movie. And I'm not funny anymore. Oh no, no, no,
[5424.18s -> 5443.74s]  no. Now I'm out for fucking blood. I fucked this whole camera, but I don't even know what to do now.
[5444.30s -> 5453.64s]  This fucking music's been playing the whole time in the background.
[5456.71s -> 5477.22s]  I don't know. I can't fix it. No, I'm not doing the sleep thing again. I need to fix the webcam.
[5477.94s -> 5496.95s]  Hey, there we go. Hi. I look better than I did before. Don't have a wink. How much XP did I get?
[5503.77s -> 5517.77s]  Funny. The funny guy. I got my eye on you. I'm noticing how triangular his face is.
[5517.77s -> 5526.30s]  I got my eye on you. All right, let's go back to what we were doing.
[5530.22s -> 5541.98s]  Uh, have I just been, oh shit, wait, put on Kirby? Sure. What do you want? Kirby's,
[5543.77s -> 5548.09s]  we got Kirby's Adventure, Kirby's Epic Yarn, Kirby's Dream Land, Kirby's Epic Yarn,
[5548.09s -> 5552.17s]  OST, Kirby's Dream Course, Kirby's Adventure, OST, Kirby's Dream Land 3, Kirby's Dream Land 3, OST,
[5552.17s -> 5566.10s]  Kirby's Dream Superstar, Air Ride. There's a lot here. Kirby's Air Ride, OST. Cool. All right.
[5566.58s -> 5589.96s]  All right. Cool. Nice. Is this what you want? This is what you wanted, right? All right. Okay.
[5590.76s -> 5598.30s]  Uh, gross ring level four. Wait, what is this one? Combine them. Zero out of one, zero to three,
[5598.30s -> 5610.54s]  toughness zero to one, health regen. One, three, one. That's good. What about this one? This is
[5610.54s -> 5616.30s]  one out of five. That just kind of scared me. One out of five, three, 15, level four,
[5616.30s -> 5623.90s]  it's now level nine. Get it up there again. I've got the new cube still on. That's good.
[5624.70s -> 5631.30s]  So in this, have I really capped out here? What am I putting my points into?
[5636.98s -> 5646.66s]  Really? Only three and a half billion? That's kind of bullshit. Oh, that's a baseline I can
[5646.66s -> 5655.22s]  get behind. All right. Okay. What is this? Let's see. No. I think I have to rebirth.
[5656.10s -> 5669.16s]  That's, that's meaty. Yeah, that's a meaty base. 20, 18. Let's shoot this one down easily.
[5674.30s -> 5681.99s]  Poison. That's all right. No enemies. All right. You got the tutorial cube. Sewers. Big rat.
[5682.79s -> 5688.42s]  Kill it. You can't see it. I have to make it smaller. I know you can't see it. I know.
[5689.78s -> 5705.58s]  I'm trying. I know. Am I gonna? Bronze lion boss. Die. Got it. 2900 gold. Cracked amulet.
[5706.30s -> 5721.00s]  Small mouse. Kill it. How much more gold do I need? Slightly bigger mouse. Move my camera
[5721.00s -> 5727.37s]  into the bottom left and flip it. I see what you're saying. Try it. See what it looks.
[5728.01s -> 5746.65s]  That like seems strange though. I'm like flipped the wrong way. I'm wearing a rat's t-shirt now.
[5747.45s -> 5755.46s]  All right. I'm low money. Need gold. Get loads of gold. I don't know how much I have.
[5756.10s -> 5767.54s]  How much gold do I even own? I don't know. I don't fucking know.
[5770.49s -> 5777.67s]  Rat wars. Rats wars. Ben Folds. People could be giving a lot of money today.
[5779.90s -> 5784.46s]  Every start of the Kirby's soundtrack startles me. I don't know if I want to listen to it anymore.
[5786.60s -> 5795.03s]  But Ben Folds gave 10,000 bits. They say Jerma's holding my bits hostage until I give him more
[5795.03s -> 5802.63s]  money. Not true. But thank you for the $100. It's 10,000 bits. Jerma, I think you didn't
[5802.63s -> 5807.43s]  see my last bits but just want to say that you're my favorite streamer and you've got me through a
[5807.43s -> 5813.98s]  lot of rough patches. I can always count on you right in my day. Jerma Heart. Jerma Heart right
[5813.98s -> 5821.62s]  back at you. Thank you for the 10,000 bits. That's a shitload of money. Thank you. I'm just kicking
[5821.62s -> 5827.14s]  ass in here. I got to beat boss 17 to advance to the next level. Are you kidding me? How am I going
[5827.14s -> 5836.12s]  to do that? But thank you. Seriously. Also Lunch Meat just gave five community subs. Thanks a lot
[5836.12s -> 5847.37s]  Lunch Meat. Welcome to the stream. Anybody that's just joining us. 2700 gold. All right it's time.
[5848.25s -> 5872.95s]  We're rebirthing here. We are rebirthing. Too bald to work. Money Pit. Is this Kingdom Hearts
[5872.95s -> 5879.51s]  or what is this? Money Pit. Bottomless pit. Just throw all your heart and gold into it. What?
[5879.51s -> 5890.36s]  The pit is hungry. Click it to feed it all your gold. This is a daily spin. So it doesn't actually
[5890.44s -> 5899.59s]  spin but it's random. Tier 0 daily spin reward table. 500 arbitrary points. Let's spin the wheel.
[5909.53s -> 5920.65s]  100? What? That's it? All right that's it. Wait time until next spin. Check the timer. Your daily
[5920.65s -> 5928.01s]  spin is not active yet. Feed me. Do you want to toss all of your hard-earned gold into the pit?
[5928.01s -> 5934.09s]  Yeah. You feel slightly more powerful. Plus one to power to be exact. How much money do I have?
[5934.97s -> 5942.30s]  Oh. All right. Fight the boss. What have I got? 16 billion. 40 billion. 1.6 billion. 4 billion.
[5943.74s -> 5948.86s]  I have. My defense is not terrible but his defense is higher than mine. We have to do something else
[5948.86s -> 5954.06s]  here. We gotta. Oh excuse me. No thank you. Put all of the points into here. We need to build this up
[5954.06s -> 5971.29s]  a little bit. Oh this is a good OST. Nice choice. Not a bad OST. I have more than twice as much
[5971.29s -> 5981.13s]  defense. Well he's got four billion attack so realistically he's got like 695 million wiggle
[5981.13s -> 5988.15s]  room there to hurt me and I believe this is you know this you know you know I'm saying like if
[5988.15s -> 5992.95s]  this is higher than this then it's gonna hurt you but if the same it leaves itself up. I don't know
[5992.95s -> 6001.43s]  how it works. I'm not a mathematician. I just fucking watch the numbers. Is this fighting right
[6001.43s -> 6013.48s]  now? I can't tell if we're fighting. That's exactly what I was telling you. See? We're almost perfect.
[6013.48s -> 6021.29s]  Nobody can get hurt. I have 1.8 attack. I can't even hurt him. Okay. He has four billion attack
[6021.29s -> 6036.22s]  so he can kind of hurt me a little bit. Oh shit. I have lots. Wait a minute. Okay. Um. I got one
[6036.22s -> 6045.46s]  of these cubes again and this necklace. Level 9 accessory. 14. So that's one. Uh. Crappy chest
[6045.46s -> 6051.45s]  plate. Three toughness. That's better than this. I'm gonna hold on to that though. What about these
[6051.45s -> 6057.61s]  crappy leggings? Three out of three. One out of one. All right. Um. Maybe I should keep these?
[6058.41s -> 6066.55s]  What can I my cube hold? More power. I'm at max power now and max health. What about toughness?
[6069.35s -> 6073.99s]  All right. I'm at four to seven. What about special? I can do this three more times. I want
[6073.99s -> 6080.07s]  the noob cube to be completely upgraded. Merge the cube. Last time I did that everybody laughed
[6080.07s -> 6101.91s]  at me. I got laughed completely out of town here. Is that worth it? Okay. Level 9 chest. I think
[6101.91s -> 6111.08s]  that's good for now. 20 billion health. 40 billion. I still need more attack. Attack tube. I'm never
[6111.08s -> 6120.17s]  gonna get there. Energy power. Let's do this one. 0.1. That was not even worth it I don't think.
[6120.17s -> 6138.22s]  Wait did I? It instantly went up. That was a mistake. Okay. Inventory is four out of four
[6138.22s -> 6147.61s]  power. It's already better. And it's level four. So I am now able to move on but I can't because I
[6147.61s -> 6157.26s]  have to beat the 17th boss here. I'm only boss nine. This is boss number nine. Why does you
[6157.26s -> 6169.14s]  already have a bathroom cam? Just in case. I don't know. I don't want to get up. Fight. Wait a minute.
[6173.30s -> 6187.14s]  I can kill it. That means I can nuke it right? See you later. No. I can't. Nope. I have to fight it.
[6187.14s -> 6201.93s]  We have to watch this go down. Nuke is only when you can instantly win. I see. What are you guys
[6201.93s -> 6205.93s]  what are you guys linking images for? What's on these images? So I think it's something that's
[6205.93s -> 6239.58s]  gonna embarrass me. No it's just you traced my face. I know exactly what you did here. Actually
[6239.58s -> 6247.58s]  how did you how did you do this? Did you just take a screenshot and then trace it? I don't even know
[6247.58s -> 6257.30s]  what the fuck it is. Where did it just go? Save it. Save the desktop. It's there. What the fuck?
[6261.35s -> 6286.47s]  I have so much dog shit on my desktop. It's unbelievable. I didn't mean to do that. Bring
[6286.47s -> 6300.52s]  it back. You're not leaving yet. There it is. Looks pretty good. I look very I look very sad
[6300.52s -> 6308.60s]  and tired. Whoa. I won? I didn't even get a chance to see my victory. That was like an hour and a
[6308.60s -> 6315.69s]  half in the making. God damn it. What did I get for that? Holy shit. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[6315.69s -> 6325.99s]  Money. Experience. This guy's got 200 billion HP. 10 versus three. No we have to revert this one.
[6325.99s -> 6335.05s]  No way I'm doing this shit. Uh-uh. Wait whoa whoa whoa whoa. Money pit. Throw it in there. Whatever.
[6336.14s -> 6338.94s]  Oh I can't. I have to wait an hour and a half. I have to wait two hours to do this.
[6340.63s -> 6346.98s]  Buy energy speed. You're killing me. I already have been. I got two points for energy speed.
[6348.49s -> 6352.49s]  What song is this? I feel like I'm going crazy not remembering this. This is from curvy's air ride
[6353.29s -> 6358.73s]  uh ost and I don't know what the name of the song is but it's the full soundtrack
[6360.12s -> 6366.04s]  just in the background while we just hang out and fucking play the game that everybody was
[6367.50s -> 6375.64s]  very happy and excited to play. I was. All right let's do uh I got three. I'll do it again. Fine.
[6375.64s -> 6387.61s]  Energy speed. Cool. All right back to the uh this is a 40 minute rebirth time. What do you think?
[6391.91s -> 6396.46s]  2,500. This is how the number that we have just exponentially increased.
[6397.10s -> 6410.01s]  Let's do it. Boom. Inventory. Let's let's make this. This is a mess.
[6411.42s -> 6416.50s]  Toughness. I can still do a few more toughness in here. What's my what are my stats out here?
[6416.50s -> 6424.62s]  Plus 15 plus 12. Special energy bonus. Cracked amulet is at 14. I'm gonna have to start putting
[6424.62s -> 6432.22s]  points into these too aren't I? 4 to 20. 4 to 21. This stick is just kind of taking up space.
[6433.26s -> 6445.99s]  The mouse is broken. What do you mean? I can still see it. What's my uh energy cap now?
[6450.89s -> 6459.88s]  Already at five million. Fight boss. It took one second. Every time you rebirth the longer
[6459.88s -> 6468.28s]  you do it and the more you just you get exponentially more. I can just click it. Oh he killed me.
[6469.42s -> 6484.54s]  Right. Oops. All right that's fine. I'm in the millions now. Dubai. Four million. Nothing. 11
[6484.54s -> 6496.26s]  million. Nothing. 65 million HP. Mouse. You're out. Large rat. 325 million HP. Let's keep let's
[6496.26s -> 6504.41s]  keep that going up. 28 million. Now I know why that person said get the speed man. That's what
[6504.49s -> 6509.42s]  I'm going for it. I'll try to get a couple. I should do just one. Two. Four. Six. Eight. Ten.
[6509.42s -> 6517.96s]  Twelve. Four. Six. Eight. Twenty. I guess it is the same. Drugs are bad. What are you implying
[6517.96s -> 6529.32s]  that I'm on drugs? Why are you implying I'm on drugs? All right. How much attack? Oh you keep.
[6529.32s -> 6538.90s]  See you later. What do you got for defense? 87 million. You're dead. 437 million defense.
[6539.70s -> 6550.22s]  He killed me. All right. I'm dead. Don't matter. I'll just restart. Cap that out. I want more
[6550.22s -> 6562.31s]  defense. I want one billion defense and it's all going into idle attack. The adventure zone. I will
[6562.31s -> 6573.46s]  in just a second. All right. Almost there. Let's see what we got now. One billion. Your attack. I
[6573.46s -> 6579.06s]  need your. I need to have a little bit higher defense than this. We are. We're already at the
[6579.06s -> 6588.31s]  wall. Fuck. We are already at the wall already. Adventure. All right. Let's go back to the sewers
[6588.95s -> 6601.67s]  and just farm. Farm money. Has it been 30? 40? I'm sucked in. Pretty good Beetlejuice song. Not bad.
[6615.82s -> 6623.72s]  Play the Beetlejuice OST. I don't think anybody wants to hear that. There it is. All right. He's
[6623.72s -> 6632.73s]  out. What was the last thing that I got to? Wasn't the goblin. This is 40 billion. I need some time
[6632.73s -> 6651.21s]  here. Need HP and need attack. What's my cap right now? Probably 800. 1,045 energy is what I can have.
[6653.64s -> 6662.02s]  Sounds pretty good to me. What I got to experience. 2 EXP. Energy speed. Keep going. Money pit. 47
[6662.02s -> 6674.25s]  minutes. Don't say it again. All right. I already made that joke. I think I've done that joke twice.
[6675.05s -> 6685.98s]  All right. Kirby's Air Ride was pretty cool, but let's do another one. How about do WarioWare?
[6686.54s -> 6701.34s]  That's pretty good. I like that one. Wario Wario WarioWare OST. Smooth moves. Yeah. That's the one.
[6702.62s -> 6712.49s]  That's track one. Here comes track two. I'm not sure why there's a track specifically for him
[6712.49s -> 6723.72s]  doing the voice line. All right. What do we got? 12 billion? 5 billion. I think I can do it now.
[6723.72s -> 6742.92s]  Yeah. This is the intro. This is a classic game. All right. Here comes the wall. 20 billion. 10
[6742.92s -> 6751.77s]  billion. I can get over that, but I need this to be higher. Holy shit. I need more. This is hurting
[6751.77s -> 6755.78s]  my eyes looking at this. I can't look at this for more than five seconds. It actually hurts my head.
[6756.42s -> 6767.21s]  Oh shit. More of this. Helmet. Just drag the helmets together and then on top. Level 19 head.
[6771.59s -> 6778.06s]  Ring. I'm going to keep just combining the rings until they're better. I think I'm going to start
[6778.06s -> 6784.79s]  boosting up. Okay. Here we go. I'm going to do power on sword. Is there a special on the sword?
[6784.79s -> 6796.28s]  There's not. Energy speed. Oh, there's special up here. 2% more energy speed. I'm all right with that.
[6803.00s -> 6815.24s]  All right. 11 billion attack. I can now hurt him, but he's doing way more to me. I think I'm just
[6815.24s -> 6820.34s]  going to dump every point into one thing. Yeah. To do auto merge, I have to do the unlock. There's an
[6820.34s -> 6842.54s]  unlock I have to actually do. It's just something for me to do at this point. Money pit. 44 minutes.
[6842.54s -> 6851.96s]  That's counting slower. That's counting slower now. All right. 11 idle. Let's just put it up here.
[6853.54s -> 6858.74s]  16 billion. Look, that's going up quick though. You know what? No. All of it goes in here. Put
[6858.74s -> 6865.02s]  every single thing in here. I want that. I want to see this number jump. There we go. All right.
[6865.99s -> 6874.73s]  I'm almost going to be doing double what you have in defense. You lied about hot lava.
[6875.99s -> 6888.47s]  Not necessarily. I got addicted to this game. He just put on this OST. Give it some time.
[6889.11s -> 6897.98s]  Yeah. I just put it on. The WarioWare for the Wii had a great soundtrack. So yeah, this will be on
[6897.98s -> 6905.46s]  for a little while. That's fine. All right. Almost going to be two times, three times what he has.
[6913.13s -> 6916.46s]  I haven't had a single clue what's going on this whole time. Let me fill you in.
[6918.94s -> 6925.93s]  Up here, you have a bar that is constantly producing energy. When you get energy,
[6926.57s -> 6932.57s]  you can use your energy. It's one point. See over here. One point will generate.
[6933.45s -> 6941.94s]  I don't know how it works either. It generates a level. One point of energy makes a level,
[6942.74s -> 6954.95s]  which increases this bar to increase your HP and your attack. And so now I'm using, I have 1045
[6954.95s -> 6962.20s]  energy. I'm using all of it right now to do like to supercharge this. And now that I've done 5,000
[6962.20s -> 6969.91s]  of these, I can do this now, which is just a better idea because this gives you more points
[6970.55s -> 6977.02s]  per energy level. And then once you get to a certain, I have a thousand points in here.
[6978.55s -> 6983.83s]  This is the defense section. So right now I don't have any, I don't have any,
[6985.34s -> 6990.15s]  the mouse is out of sync. That is weird. Why is that happening?
[6990.15s -> 6996.34s]  Okay. Right now my mouse is down in the lower lower right hand side of the screen.
[6996.34s -> 7012.04s]  That's weird. I don't know why it's doing that. Jeremy, help my dog. It'll be all right. All
[7012.04s -> 7017.30s]  right. So I'm just in the time that we've been talking, just in the time that we've been hanging
[7017.30s -> 7027.53s]  out here, I've gotten 37 billion. This is the one. So then you take what you have done. You
[7027.53s -> 7034.31s]  take the upgrades that you've done to your counting mechanism and you go over to the
[7034.31s -> 7039.99s]  fighting screen. And then you, I've built up enough attack and HP where I now I'm stronger
[7039.99s -> 7045.43s]  than this orc. And then you hit the fight button. And as you see, I call, I need to explain it better.
[7045.43s -> 7050.31s]  I have 40 billion. Let's just say, I'm going to say round numbers. I have 40 attack. He has 10
[7050.31s -> 7057.75s]  defense. Therefore I'm doing 30 attack to this orc per quadra second. Okay. That's how it works.
[7057.75s -> 7066.07s]  I have seven defense and he has 20 offense. I am taking 14 worth of points per quadra second
[7066.07s -> 7070.47s]  of damage. That's what you, that's how it works. So I'm trying to kill him faster than he can kill
[7070.47s -> 7078.39s]  me. He can still kill me faster. I'm going to hold on to my points. My inventory is getting,
[7084.71s -> 7091.11s]  okay. I can, it's the music's fucking me up because I feel like I want to press start.
[7091.11s -> 7095.42s]  Like I feel like I'm just press start already. Get, move on to the next menu.
[7095.98s -> 7103.94s]  Toughness is okay. I, by the way, if you choose, I, I, if you combine items, for instance, these
[7104.50s -> 7113.88s]  chest plates, they, do you see the number here? Um, when you, when you combine these, for instance,
[7113.88s -> 7118.04s]  when I drag this over here, the smelly chest, whatever it's called, it's splattered with some
[7118.04s -> 7123.88s]  smelly. Yes. So you can combine them. I just did. And now this makes it a little bit better.
[7128.28s -> 7144.14s]  Yeah. Why is this doing that? I'm so confused. I need power. Toughness. Yeah. I can do one more
[7144.14s -> 7151.02s]  because I just upgraded the cube. That's it. This is maxed out. Time to move on to other products.
[7151.82s -> 7158.89s]  Let's put it in here. Put the hat in. Power up the sword. All right. That's, that's all adventure.
[7158.89s -> 7173.30s]  That's all I can do. I need to get this boss 17. Go. Got it. Got it. All right. Now I need to do
[7173.30s -> 7185.53s]  this. I need way, I need to cap this out. We need more of this beat boss 10. This is pushing
[7185.53s -> 7188.41s]  your way through. You encounter a small clearing in the forest to try to dash through, but barely
[7188.41s -> 7192.57s]  make it halfway before rotting corpses begin clawing their way out of the earth. One week
[7193.21s -> 7198.25s]  shuffling zombie inches towards you might as well have some fun. Okay. He's got a hundred billion
[7198.25s -> 7204.68s]  attack. This one ain't going to go so well. Money pit 38 minutes. This is counting slow.
[7205.16s -> 7217.74s]  I'm going to adventure. I need to get to 17. That ain't going to happen. It's been a week.
[7218.84s -> 7232.39s]  It's wake up. It's been a week. I got to refill that. I wanted a coffee. Trying to Google this
[7232.39s -> 7243.64s]  game. Trying to Google this name. Uh, it's on steam. It's N G U space idle. Get it on steam
[7249.91s -> 7259.35s]  six out of 22 more special weight. No, that's it. No, I can do it. Ooh, I finally got boots.
[7259.35s -> 7264.55s]  Now I'm in, I'm in full leather Minecraft gear. Still have a wooden sword though. That's not good.
[7265.19s -> 7271.00s]  This has to be trashed. So do these get these things out of here. Should I? Yeah. What am I?
[7271.00s -> 7283.37s]  I don't need these 34 accessory. Let's see power zero. It's all zero. All right. 50 billion attack
[7283.37s -> 7290.20s]  almost there. I can almost hurt this guy. My defense needs to be much better. I have six
[7290.20s -> 7305.90s]  points. All right. Why have I not been saving for this plus 10,000, 10,000. I thought it was 10.
[7310.92s -> 7320.54s]  Oh my goodness. That opens up everything that makes it. Oh my God. All right. But it's too hard.
[7320.54s -> 7334.44s]  Okay. Six. I need to get that higher 50 billion attack. Almost. What do you get for defense?
[7335.08s -> 7346.79s]  It needs to be higher. It needs to be much higher. All right. Pull this back. We're going to do 50,
[7346.79s -> 7351.99s]  50 split here. I got a thousand. We're going to do a thousand, 500, 500, 45. Let it work.
[7352.79s -> 7362.01s]  Well, I do a Fortnite dance to Mario. Where's OST? Just kidding. What happened to the lava game?
[7362.01s -> 7373.70s]  It's still available. What did the dev say? You can't buy the energy cap upgrades until
[7373.70s -> 7395.05s]  you max out energy from rebirthing. Oh shit. I like that. I have to fill this before I lose
[7395.05s -> 7401.64s]  my mind. You know, the tooth prick, that whole joke with the convention. The reason why that
[7401.64s -> 7409.40s]  existed guys is because if I don't have something in my hands or in my mouth or something to hold,
[7410.04s -> 7430.90s]  I go nuts. It's like, it like pacifies me. Otherwise I'd be like, I need it. You're having
[7430.90s -> 7440.30s]  a fidget helps me too. I fidget a lot. That's why I'm like, I'm, you know what it is? I have,
[7440.30s -> 7447.88s]  I have like NPC coded random actions that I just pull out for no reason. You know,
[7447.88s -> 7451.08s]  when you go up to an NPC and like GTA and they're drinking out of a cup and it's empty and you're
[7451.08s -> 7458.12s]  like, oh my God, what the fuck is that guy doing? You are watching somebody do that right now.
[7459.90s -> 7472.57s]  This has been empty for an hour. I've got like GTA pedestrian wired brain up here.
[7473.37s -> 7479.80s]  Go get a refill. I can't right now. I'm too busy. All right. Let's do some power. No, in the sword.
[7482.06s -> 7495.93s]  I'm getting powerful this way. Toughness. You got it. What do we got? All right. Uh, money pit.
[7495.93s -> 7508.44s]  33 minutes. I think it's ready. What do I got? 60 to 54, 42 to 100. Not quite max HP too much.
[7509.66s -> 7520.71s]  No, I can't, I can't do it. Eight experience. I'm going to do energy power. I need 15 because
[7520.71s -> 7539.59s]  that just makes everything better. I can do another rebirth coming up. What do I need? I need defense.
[7539.59s -> 7545.22s]  I have enough attack to kill it. Training. Pull out of this. Put it all in defense. I just need
[7545.22s -> 7595.06s]  more defense. Way more. 745, 300. Sounds good. What's the name of the game? I keep winning in
[7596.10s -> 7609.24s]  Wario Kart and it's freaking me out. What color should I do? Just put it in the title. The title
[7609.24s -> 7654.78s]  of the stream. His numbers go up. He's fuming. What does stream name stand for? I don't know.
[7655.42s -> 7660.46s]  Fight boss. All right. Here we go. All right. Why are you where it's sick?
[7663.88s -> 7671.21s]  This OST has a lot of tracks that are sort of just you completed a mini game and we're going
[7671.21s -> 7676.25s]  to load a whole new soundtrack for it. Unreal tournament OST. Now that's too intense for me
[7676.25s -> 7687.78s]  right now. All right. 60, 60 billion defense. We're almost ready. Katamari. Everybody loves
[7687.78s -> 7693.88s]  Katamari. It always pops up during one of these streams. How are you guys doing today? You guys
[7693.88s -> 7709.99s]  doing good? How are things? Things going good? No? Yeah? Yeah? Katamari OST. This is Katamari
[7709.99s -> 7720.71s]  forever OST. I mean they're all good. You can kind of just pick whatever one you want. A little
[7720.71s -> 7732.97s]  louder. This is the wrong one. It's the wrong one. All right. I need to do training here. We've got
[7732.97s -> 7743.91s]  defenses. Good. It's time to only put it in the super strength one and I'm looking for enough
[7743.91s -> 7751.46s]  attack. I'm looking for about a hundred. Because if I get a hundred billion attack that I can kill
[7751.46s -> 7768.20s]  it and then we can rebirth. I might just rebirth now. Ten experience. Let's do, oh what a mess.
[7768.84s -> 7779.16s]  Okay this orange is power. That's very important to know. I can do this in here. Special is still
[7779.16s -> 7787.98s]  one more that can go in the cube and that is energy speed. Good. Special is, hold on, sword.
[7787.98s -> 7795.96s]  Let's just combine them all. This is level 19 now. Cube. Into the cube. Right? Yeah. Cube into
[7795.96s -> 7802.44s]  the cube. Special into the cube. Cube into the cube. Cube into the cube. Necklace onto the necklace.
[7802.44s -> 7807.18s]  Boots onto the boots. I can do power in there again. All right. I'm looking pretty good.
[7817.27s -> 7831.66s]  Shit. Cube into the cube. Cube into the cube. Yeah. This is a new thing. We unlock it.
[7832.38s -> 7848.70s]  Break in the lake. I need more. What's rebirth gonna look like here? That's another huge increase.
[7849.58s -> 7856.12s]  I love that there's a time factor as well to make sure you don't just spam it over and over again.
[7857.08s -> 7867.93s]  I'm gonna wait till this gets to like 25,000. I think that's a good idea. If I were to say.
[7870.38s -> 7879.27s]  Exponential increasing. I should rebirth. That number is huge. Oh yeah. I want to kill this guy
[7879.27s -> 7884.94s]  first. I'm so close to being able to take this guy out. In fact I might be able to do it now.
[7885.82s -> 7897.06s]  850. 60 to 100. It's gonna be close. He's winning. Stop. Stop. Stop. Not playing unsadistic.
[7906.44s -> 7914.31s]  What a great game. I should play this. I already did. I should play all of them.
[7914.31s -> 7921.56s]  Didn't I play two of them? I did. I should play the other ones. I'll do that next week.
[7922.12s -> 7926.42s]  I'll play the other one. I'm gonna play like two or three or something. I'll do it next week.
[7926.98s -> 7937.80s]  These games are phenomenal. Played reroll. Yeah, I did rerolled a few months ago actually, right?
[7938.52s -> 7944.63s]  All right. This is it. Here we go. Come on. This is why we were sitting here for so long.
[7944.63s -> 7951.99s]  Bring him down. Six. Six. Five. Five. Come on. Do it. Four. Bring him down to four.
[7953.64s -> 7958.38s]  And then I rebirth. It's gonna do it. It's gonna do it. It's gonna do it. I'm almost ahead of him.
[7959.02s -> 7978.74s]  Stick with it. Yes. Got it. Oh, and look at that rebirth. I wanted 25,000. We beat that boss.
[7979.54s -> 8000.52s]  Sword. Sword up to 40k. Look at that. This guy's at five trillion health. Wait, I can do
[8000.52s -> 8005.24s]  toughness and... Yeah, I can do it all in the cube. Just make that cube insane.
[8009.62s -> 8024.55s]  This is boss 12. I'm... But look at all these points. Am I streaming tomorrow? Yeah,
[8024.55s -> 8030.31s]  I'm streaming tomorrow. I was thinking about doing the community event tomorrow. Thinking
[8030.31s -> 8035.83s]  about it. I was gonna... After the stream today, I was gonna go in and pull stuff out and see if
[8035.83s -> 8042.92s]  there's enough there. If there's not enough for the community night tomorrow, then we're gonna play
[8042.92s -> 8048.90s]  just... We'll play something else. What's the gold for? For right now, it's to throw into a hole.
[8050.94s -> 8066.12s]  Maybe eventually I unlock something that's not just a money pit. I don't know. No, I'm not
[8066.12s -> 8075.11s]  playing this tomorrow. I just wanted to check this out because I like watching numbers go up.
[8076.18s -> 8080.34s]  I'm not gonna play this tomorrow. I'm not gonna... This is not gonna be the thing that I do for the
[8080.34s -> 8098.14s]  next, like, six days. Just leave it on overnight. I still wanna play Hot Lava. After I rebirth,
[8098.14s -> 8101.26s]  like, two or three more times, we're gonna play Hot Lava, and I'm gonna leave this on in the
[8101.26s -> 8120.28s]  background. 42,000. It's going up so fast. You're the number one idol gamer on Twitch.
[8122.54s -> 8126.89s]  I don't really want to be that person. I don't want to... I don't want to be that.
[8127.69s -> 8137.78s]  It's like, one day, I'm just playing this idol game. It's just chatting with some extra steps
[8141.00s -> 8150.18s]  and music. Wait for 30 minutes. All right. All right. All right. All right. I'm gonna go refill.
[8151.06s -> 8156.20s]  I'm gonna go refill. I'm just leaving it on, like, but there's no reason...
[8156.84s -> 8169.03s]  Why do I need to go to the BRB screen? I'm gonna fill this up. I'm not gonna pause this. Now,
[8169.03s -> 8175.82s]  you guys are idling. Yeah. He's never gonna play. I'm going to play Hot Lava before the stream ends
[8175.82s -> 8182.34s]  tonight. I've only been streaming for, like, two and a half hours. You got plenty of time. Don't
[8182.34s -> 8187.80s]  worry. All right. I'll be right back. I'm gonna refill. Just enjoy the music and enjoy the, uh,
[8187.80s -> 8192.60s]  number going up for a little while. Wait. Hold on. Before I leave. I need to do this first.
[8193.32s -> 8200.86s]  Rebirth. 44,000. 30 minutes. Let's see what happens as we get that time increase.
[8201.74s -> 8230.06s]  1,283 energy. How much experience? 13. I'm gonna wait for this. Basic, uh, basic training.
[8230.78s -> 8238.12s]  Let's just get... cap that out. Attack. Let's see. Holy shit. Look at each... each point. Each level
[8238.12s -> 8251.19s]  is... is, like, 50 million? 40 million? Attack? Wow. Wow. All right. See you in, like, fucking five
[8251.19s -> 8256.79s]  minutes. No. I'll be back in, like, two minutes. I'm just gonna get a refill. And then we're gonna
[8256.79s -> 8262.89s]  play Hot Lava. I don't wanna... I don't wanna check games out, man. I'm just checking it out.
[8263.53s -> 8279.32s]  We're just... I'm just checking it out. I'll be... Let me do one more thing, though. Hold on. One
[8279.32s -> 8320.02s]  more thing. Before I leave. I gotta split this up. I gotta wait till it's, like, 150, 150. All right.
[8405.66s -> 8450.10s]  What did I miss? What happened? What happened? What did I miss? Did I go up? Did I go up or
[8450.10s -> 8460.58s]  down? How much? How many points do I have? 71 billion? Did I miss anything? Perfect. 75. 75.
[8460.58s -> 8472.20s]  This is perfect. Money came out of the screen. I missed the fucking money? I hate that. I hate
[8472.20s -> 8475.96s]  when you miss, like, the click on the screen for the free money. They used to do that shit. You
[8475.96s -> 8485.72s]  guys remember that? How many of you guys remember the old 19, like, 99, 2000 year pop-up windows
[8485.72s -> 8493.34s]  that tried to get you to claim checks that didn't exist? Click here. You have unclaimed money.
[8494.73s -> 8500.60s]  Unclaimed money? Really? And you'd click it. And they would just fucking steal all your identity.
[8501.24s -> 8509.85s]  You could... Do you remember the pop-ups would just launch at the screen? There was no pop-up
[8509.85s -> 8515.77s]  blockers. There was no ad block. You got bombarded. You would have a window open here,
[8516.33s -> 8520.41s]  right in front of you. And then behind that window, after one session of browsing,
[8521.13s -> 8530.02s]  there would be 40 to 50 other windows that you didn't know were open. And yes, somebody just said
[8530.02s -> 8537.14s]  it. A bunch of them were porn ads. They just, just, no shame at all. Just porn. They would
[8537.14s -> 8545.30s]  just have open. Can you imagine browsing fucking the internet? It'd be, uh, mail and rebate, mail
[8545.30s -> 8550.10s]  and rebate, mail and rebate. Claim your check. Claim your money. You have free money. Money,
[8550.10s -> 8555.38s]  money, money. Porn, porn, porn, porn. That naked person on the screen. Two naked people on the
[8555.38s -> 8563.59s]  screen. Holy shit. Okay. How did anybody even browse back then? I don't even remember. I don't have a
[8563.59s -> 8568.71s]  memory of... I think it was just like normal. And you sat there going like this at the end of your
[8568.71s -> 8577.43s]  browsing session. X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X. And they'd play sound too. So it would be
[8577.43s -> 8584.17s]  like, yip, up, zip, yip, kip, hup, kip, hup, kip, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup. They were
[8584.17s -> 8596.06s]  fucking horrible. What do I got? 145 billion. Let's do it. Should I just nuke? No, I don't want to.
[8596.06s -> 8606.95s]  I don't like nuke. I like being able to see my progress. Goblin. Instantly. Orc. Done. Slow zombie.
[8608.63s -> 8613.66s]  Remember how long and painful this was? Oh fuck, I have a ton of idle energy.
[8621.03s -> 8633.75s]  There we go. Computers were just RuneScape machines. RuneScape machines. Faster. I'm
[8633.75s -> 8645.48s]  trying to go faster. No, here's the wall. Okay. Experience. 19. We're going to do energy power
[8645.48s -> 8651.98s]  here. Take a look up here. We got 237 billion. Approves the effectiveness of your allocated
[8651.98s -> 8661.88s]  energy. This means faster progress on features while using less energy. Energy cap. I don't have...
[8663.40s -> 8668.38s]  I think I have to hit... Once you have 100,000 max energy. I can't do it yet.
[8669.10s -> 8681.19s]  Yeah, I can't do it yet. I need 100,000. Yeah, I can't do it. Play the deadly premonition OST.
[8685.08s -> 8696.66s]  Didn't I play deadly premonition for like an hour? There's something in there now.
[8697.38s -> 8705.75s]  It freaks me out for a second. Base energy cap. So, should I just wait? I'm just gonna wait.
[8706.55s -> 8713.40s]  Can I kill you yet? Almost. What have I got? Basic training. More. In fact, no, no, no, no.
[8713.96s -> 8727.05s]  Get it all in here. All 1200. Just until this gets to 5k. You didn't think this was gonna be the most
[8727.05s -> 8754.25s]  fucking upbeat stream you've seen in a week. We're just bopping. What a cool streamer. I know the
[8754.25s -> 8762.22s]  joke that if this is your first stream of mine, then you're gonna be like every stream. We just...
[8762.22s -> 8770.90s]  I don't know. And you'll be fine. Hi, this is my first stream. What's up? Welcome to the channel.
[8775.61s -> 8788.49s]  I was voted fourth most energetic Twitch streamer with under 500,000 followers.
[8801.82s -> 8815.51s]  Why did you win that? Because I did. It's a pity award. It's not a pity award.
[8816.62s -> 8830.12s]  It's an award. Weird flex, but okay. No, the weird part about that weird flex is it's a fake
[8830.12s -> 8839.61s]  weird flex. Yeah, I was voted like 16th most energetic streamer on Twitch with
[8839.61s -> 8849.05s]  followers between 200 and 51,000 and 251,000 and 14. I was voted number 14 on that list.
[8851.53s -> 8862.07s]  Pretty good if you ask me. What? Why am I lying? I have a very important question for everybody
[8862.07s -> 8871.82s]  watching right now. Important. When does a lie become a lie? Because if you say something that's
[8871.82s -> 8880.14s]  not true and immediately it's corrected, is that a lie? I think a lie has to sit as if it were fact
[8880.14s -> 8888.30s]  for at least one day. I think that's not a lie because I'm not trying to push it off as real.
[8889.02s -> 8897.78s]  What is it 15 minutes? If I tell you that hey I won an award at TwitchCon for top 40
[8898.98s -> 8906.10s]  funny faces and I didn't correct it and like four days went by, that's a lie. But if I told you,
[8906.98s -> 8914.10s]  I bet you, no that's a bet. If I told you that I won that award and then 10 seconds later I said
[8914.10s -> 8918.26s]  that's not real it's a fucking joke. When is a lie a joke and when is a joke a lie?
[8919.72s -> 8936.49s]  No, a lie has to sit for 24 hours before it's a lie. I will stand by that. Untruth. Wait,
[8936.49s -> 8941.45s]  hold on. I'm facing an ent. You haul ass and make it past the clearing managing to shake off most
[8941.45s -> 8945.77s]  of those fast charging type zombies. After putting some more distance between you and them,
[8945.77s -> 8949.69s]  you take a breather against a tree until it starts moving under you. God damn it.
[8950.57s -> 8960.63s]  Yeah, I only lie for 23 hours at a time. I'm trying to think, have I ever told you guys like
[8960.63s -> 8969.56s]  a true lie? Like a real one? One that sat for 24 hours that was me lying to you about something.
[8970.44s -> 8975.96s]  You lied about Sam and Max. I didn't lie about Sam and Max. I played season three and didn't like
[8975.96s -> 8986.60s]  it. I played something and didn't like it. That's a lie. You lied about Ace Attorney. Now I told you
[8986.60s -> 8989.00s]  that I played Ace Attorney for a little bit off stream and I didn't think it was going to be a
[8989.00s -> 8992.28s]  stream I wanted to stream. A game I wanted to stream. That's not a lie. That's me coming to
[8992.28s -> 9002.41s]  a conclusion and I told you that. You lied about Wailord. What'd you say? What did you say? I heard
[9002.41s -> 9011.59s]  you. What are you saying? I still haven't watched that by the way. You took more than 24 hours to
[9011.59s -> 9022.10s]  correct it. Wait, I gotta do stuff. Oh, fuck. I didn't take more than 24 hours to correct that.
[9022.90s -> 9034.44s]  Wait, this is power. Max power. I'm gonna go over my inventory here and see what's better. Okay,
[9034.52s -> 9039.80s]  three. This is good. Three. This accessory's not going anywhere. It's the noob cube. I'm not
[9039.80s -> 9049.11s]  taking it off. Money. Eight minutes. Where's my gold? Oh, fuck. It's because I reset. All right,
[9049.11s -> 9055.53s]  hold on. Training here. I need to do this. Hold this out. We gotta get this 5,000 as fast as
[9055.53s -> 9064.97s]  possible. You lied about Monster Rancher 4. Did I though? Did I lie about Monster Rancher 4?
[9067.85s -> 9072.81s]  Somebody just gave five community subs thanks to whoever did that. That was anonymous. Thanks to
[9072.81s -> 9084.71s]  the five community subs. Just anonymous. Thanks a lot whoever you are. You lied about the definition
[9084.71s -> 9096.97s]  of lying. What are you guys on about? What an incredible soundtrack to this video game.
[9100.68s -> 9110.14s]  I wanted to stop playing this game an hour ago and move on to hot lava, but I can't because I
[9110.14s -> 9124.68s]  have to see. I need to know. We'll do a long one tonight. How is that a lie? No, a lie is not a
[9124.68s -> 9130.68s]  lie until it is something that you specifically are trying to push forward as a truth that sits
[9130.68s -> 9141.03s]  in everybody's bellies for 24 hours. What's this game called? It's called. Look it up. It's on
[9141.03s -> 9160.90s]  Steam. It's a lie. It's only a lie if you believe it. What? No, a lie. A lie is something that,
[9160.90s -> 9167.30s]  a statement that you are making to try to push forward as a real thing or a truth that you want
[9167.30s -> 9173.86s]  people to think is real that sits in their bellies for 24 hours and you continue to try to push the
[9173.86s -> 9182.09s]  fact that it is real when it never was in the first place. Now I make mistakes, okay? Ace Attorney,
[9182.09s -> 9186.33s]  me saying I was going to play Ace Attorney was a mistake. That's not a lie. It's a mistake.
[9187.05s -> 9202.84s]  I make mistakes. I don't lie. All right, I'm almost there. I just want to play hot lava,
[9202.84s -> 9209.34s]  but I fucking can't. I cannot. I can't do it. That means I have to hit the X here, but like I can't.
[9209.34s -> 9221.35s]  My body won't do it. 25 trillion defense. All right, getting there. What do I got for rebirth here?
[9223.37s -> 9230.65s]  150,000. I need 15 more minutes and that doubles. Switch monitors. I can't do that.
[9231.29s -> 9241.80s]  No, I can't do that. No, I cannot. I can't. Watch the video of lies compiled. Nobody's made it.
[9241.80s -> 9246.97s]  I said to make that a long time ago and nobody made it. I was like, if you want to call me out,
[9246.97s -> 9252.33s]  I want a Jerma has lied video and a compilation of everything I've ever said that was a lie.
[9252.33s -> 9264.06s]  I made that challenge and what do you know? I haven't seen it yet. There are too many.
[9265.02s -> 9282.06s]  It's still uploading. It's very long. Okay. What even is this game?
[9290.02s -> 9298.55s]  It's an ever-growing video. Did you ever do that Stardew co-op stream? No, because Stardew...
[9299.83s -> 9304.54s]  All right, I have to play. I have to focus and get busy.
[9305.34s -> 9311.26s]  22 experience. Almost getting close to 40. Go to my inventory. I'm not even on an adventure.
[9312.22s -> 9326.26s]  Hurry them up. Wait, I'm going to say two. Two versus 1.3. Two versus... I need more defense.
[9326.26s -> 9334.84s]  Let's get it up. Boys and girls, I need defense. Get it up. Come on. I need 10,000 in this to this.
[9334.84s -> 9343.80s]  Never going to happen. Changing the subject. What do you mean? Make sure to unlock popping gamer.
[9346.73s -> 9354.94s]  I already was gotten by that one, so you're not going to get me again. What track is this?
[9355.50s -> 9359.26s]  I don't know. It's just the whole two and a half hour long OST.
[9362.01s -> 9368.87s]  You lied about peeking your mic. I peeked my mic yesterday by screaming about a flashbang.
[9369.59s -> 9381.67s]  Is it actually sick music? Yes, it is. Two minutes until I can throw money in there.
[9382.31s -> 9398.81s]  All right, I'm going for it. Not going to be fast enough, but I need it. No, it's not going to happen.
[9398.81s -> 9416.76s]  Stop. I need a little more attack. All right, enough. A little more attack. Cap it. Let's go.
[9420.15s -> 9426.42s]  Just enough to give myself the edge here. You said two or three more rebirths before the
[9426.42s -> 9440.23s]  lava game. I did one. Upcoming here is two, and then after that will be three. Bingo. What do we
[9440.23s -> 9455.99s]  got? 179,000. Oh, and in 10 minutes, that's doubles. Double. What's it going to be at? 181.
[9457.03s -> 9463.80s]  Boom. See you later. Giant. Entering this forest is feeling more and more like a bad idea. Even
[9463.80s -> 9469.08s]  the air is starting to taste sort of odd, like copper and iron. You strained to keep an eye on
[9469.08s -> 9472.92s]  the forest path with the haze thickening around you. You managed to keep on the path, but somehow
[9472.92s -> 9484.82s]  also managed to bump right into a giant in front of you. Enjoy the fight. Who's Bob? He's got 12
[9484.82s -> 9491.22s]  trillion attacks. That ain't going to work out. 375,000. We're just going to last another 10
[9491.22s -> 9502.31s]  minutes. You lied about Flora's Lava. You haven't waited 24 hours yet. You haven't waited, because
[9502.31s -> 9520.52s]  in like an hour, that's not going to be a lie. Oh, this is hot. I like this one. This is a hot
[9520.52s -> 9541.61s]  track. Little did you guys think that fucking idle number counting stream is going to be the most
[9541.61s -> 9554.30s]  lit stream you've been at all day. It's not a lie. It hasn't been 24 hours yet. You can go to like
[9554.30s -> 9570.49s]  a music stream in about 45 minutes and it's not a lie. Please don't say lit. Say whatever I want.
[9571.13s -> 9589.03s]  Lit is as bad as epic. I know epic is a whole nother tier. I think you can still say lit
[9589.03s -> 9594.23s]  ironically as a joke and it's okay. Epic is like completely out of completely out of bounds now.
[9603.00s -> 9613.38s]  Epic is in a category on its own. All right, one more rebirth and I'm going to play hot lava
[9613.94s -> 9616.98s]  and I'm going to keep this running in the background and we're going to check in on it
[9616.98s -> 9629.03s]  every now and then. Seven and a half minutes countdown until floor is lava. Chat complaining
[9629.03s -> 9633.43s]  about youth culture. You guys are the real boomers, but you guys are youth culture.
[9634.23s -> 9640.52s]  I can see in my my analytics. You guys are youth culture. This is you.
[9641.48s -> 9654.52s]  Not me anymore. I bet you still have cookie clicker running. I'm out of that category now
[9654.52s -> 9664.20s]  as of my 34th birthday. Everyone here is in their 30s. What are you talking about?
[9665.53s -> 9672.42s]  I, you know, I would assume there's probably a few 30 year olds here. How many people are here? Like
[9672.42s -> 9683.46s]  4,400, 4,400 people. Maybe 2,500 30 year olds. All right, six minutes until I could rebirth and
[9683.46s -> 9690.90s]  this is getting minimized and opening hot lava and I can stop getting just the outpour of fucking
[9690.90s -> 9698.79s]  hate mail that's coming in through my PO box over here. The stack this high of letters telling me to
[9698.79s -> 9719.75s]  change game. They just keep coming in using letters. Do not stop playing this game. I'm
[9719.75s -> 9727.24s]  not going to stop playing this game. Just because I'm moving on to another game doesn't mean that
[9727.24s -> 9738.36s]  this game stops because I've got news for you. Once I'm done playing, you don't speak during
[9738.36s -> 9779.11s]  this track, by the way. I forget what I was going to say. I don't remember what it was. It was
[9779.11s -> 9783.99s]  something important. Oh yeah, the game's going to be playing in the background while we play hot lava
[9783.99s -> 9790.36s]  and then everyone that wants to see a different game today will do that and then we're coming
[9790.36s -> 9797.98s]  back to this. This game might get closed. Still can't even fight this guy. What we got? Rebirth. We
[9797.98s -> 9806.23s]  have four minutes. We're going to hit a million. One million. One million. One million. Money pit.
[9806.95s -> 9836.42s]  Not yet. After I killed the giant. No. This is a bitcoin mining scam. This is a
[9837.38s -> 9846.87s]  idle game that has a very passionate developer who has made tons of content in here. How dare you
[9848.12s -> 9860.01s]  say something that much of a lie in 23 hours and 59 minutes? I demand an apology.
[9860.81s -> 9876.06s]  Here comes a call out post. I'm never going to be able to do this. Hold on. Here it comes.
[9877.03s -> 9883.21s]  And then after this, I just want to see what a million number points looks like. Why am I
[9883.29s -> 9893.05s]  holding this? Have I showed you the book of our lord? Sir, if you have just one moment.
[9904.10s -> 9924.47s]  Two minutes. Two minutes until we can play another game. Read the fucking book. This
[9924.47s -> 9929.16s]  webcam is mirrored. Yeah, because if I wasn't mirrored I'd be looking over this way. No,
[9929.16s -> 9933.08s]  I have to point the wrong way. So I have to point this way because it's mirrored. I'd be looking
[9933.08s -> 9938.62s]  this way and I'd be looking at the video game screen with my board game. Look at all these
[9938.62s -> 9951.08s]  things to unlock. All right. I'm going to take a look. Power. One, two, three. Money pit. Not yet.
[9951.08s -> 9992.25s]  Here we go. This is going to be it. One minute. He's stalling. There's a countdown on the screen.
[9992.25s -> 10000.17s]  It's not a stall. There's a 30, I have to burn 30 seconds here. The game is a stall.
[10001.86s -> 10005.78s]  All right. Okay. Now I see what you're doing with this one. All right.
[10007.98s -> 10017.34s]  Oh, one million coming up. One fucking million. Biggest number you've ever seen. I've ever seen
[10017.34s -> 10032.38s]  my whole life. Okay. Now I just want to, I just want to know what it looks like. Somebody right
[10032.38s -> 10039.00s]  now is in their chair just going like, get out of this fucking game. And I'm just sitting there
[10039.00s -> 10051.48s]  going, hey, I like this one. So you're like strapped to the chair. Get me out of this chair.
[10052.52s -> 10058.74s]  I got this like tape and God, why do you look like Leon from Resident Evil? Cause I was the
[10058.74s -> 10077.96s]  fucking face map for that game. All right. But we, I don't want to turn the music. This music is,
[10077.96s -> 10084.42s]  I don't want to, I don't want to turn the music off. We can't wait, wait until the whole OST
[10084.42s -> 10091.38s]  is done. In two hours. Wait till the OST is done in two hours and we'll play hot lava. That's a good
[10091.38s -> 10102.73s]  enough, that's a good compromise. I think it's all about compromise. Kidding. But we do have to turn
[10102.73s -> 10108.18s]  the music off. But I, hold on. Important. Let me get, let me clean this up first and then I'm
[10108.18s -> 10112.50s]  going to let it run in the background while I jump from device to device and try to not land on the
[10112.50s -> 10130.30s]  ground. Toughness. Special. Special. Toughness. Special. Toughness. Look, 27 points. Here comes
[10130.30s -> 10141.53s]  the rebirth at 1.1 million. Do it. Go. I just want to see what it looks like. I forgot about the money.
[10142.09s -> 10154.95s]  You have been immensely distracting me. It's okay. So I just need to know. Where's the cap now?
[10154.95s -> 10164.23s]  1500 energy points. Nice. All right. I just want to see. How much is one point is worth? Two billion,
[10164.23s -> 10178.42s]  three billion, four billion. We're already at billions? Holy shit. My head hurts. Take a couple
[10178.42s -> 10182.86s]  aspirin. Or like acetaminophen. If you're sensitive to aspirin, take acetaminophen.
[10183.58s -> 10190.15s]  Sensitive to that. Maybe grab like an aspirin or something. And take a break off the computer.
[10190.15s -> 10193.69s]  You know, just take a break from the computer. If you're on the computer for too long,
[10194.33s -> 10200.81s]  it irritates your skin. You know what I mean? You have to put on sunscreen. See what the problem I
[10200.81s -> 10205.13s]  think is, is your screen brightness is so high, you're not wearing sunscreen. Like, come on.
[10206.54s -> 10214.04s]  All right. Let's just go. I want to just clip through these. One, two, three, four, five, six,
[10214.04s -> 10220.20s]  seven, eight, nine, ten. Without even doing anything. I just want to see. Trillion. Bring
[10220.20s -> 10234.46s]  it down. This guy was a pain in the ass. What about if my nose hurts? Should I take a break
[10234.46s -> 10256.17s]  from breathing? You should breathe. Why am I not doing well? I just want to see. Uh oh. Right now.
[10256.17s -> 10274.33s]  Like, right now. Right now. When I just didn't go immediately to hot lava. The person that was
[10274.33s -> 10286.55s]  mad that I was still here. Like, the alarm sounded in their room. Hold on. It's like, wait, he's
[10286.55s -> 10294.06s]  still, he's still in the game. What's he still doing in the game? Why is he still in here?
[10296.07s -> 10321.40s]  What are you doing in here? Okay. So what happened there? Um, I went a little too hard.
[10321.40s -> 10335.61s]  I went, I went a little too hard. I kind of like made myself a little dizzy. I went too hard. I
[10335.61s -> 10345.24s]  was like bracing and pushing blood into my head. And what the fuck was that? He pooped his pants.
[10347.54s -> 10364.38s]  That would be a real alarm that I would have to leave if that happened. Hold on. I'm good.
[10378.76s -> 10393.32s]  Only 295 rebirth points? What? Oh, I'm supposed to leave. Right. I'm supposed to leave. All right.
[10393.32s -> 10401.88s]  Let me just get, I need to get to my cap. Okay. That's important. Let me get to the cap. Let me,
[10401.88s -> 10409.16s]  I just, let me get to the cap. I just need to get to the cap. Calm down. Turn it off. Don't worry.
[10409.16s -> 10420.30s]  You're gonna get your lava video game. Oh fuck. Adventure. Right. Idle it. I'm, I'm going, I'm good.
[10421.10s -> 10429.69s]  In the sewers. I want lava. I want lava. I want lava. You'll get it. Why do I have an artifacting
[10429.69s -> 10436.25s]  on my webcam? Why does my webcam look, it's like underwater. That's weird. Lava video game now.
[10436.25s -> 10446.57s]  Lava video game now. Lava video game now. Just wait. I need to get my cap so I can be running
[10446.57s -> 10452.73s]  in the background. You know how many rebirth is the continuation multipliers are going to exist
[10452.73s -> 10468.76s]  after like playing the lava game for 20 minutes? We want numbers. Shit. Hold on. All right. I got
[10468.76s -> 10484.78s]  to, let me, I need to get to 12 or 1500. I am very close to doing a 10k. Let me slow you down a
[10484.78s -> 10496.92s]  little. Let me just like even you up. Let's see. We're gonna melt faster than the lava. What can
[10496.92s -> 10507.10s]  he say? The guy likes numbers going up. Thank you. To that person. You get it. You get it. I just,
[10507.10s -> 10523.19s]  I like it. You get it. Tree dead. Giant. Let me just be the giant and we'll go and I'm actually
[10523.19s -> 10527.91s]  going to minimize it. You can, you watch me. I'm going to click the minimize and I'm going to open
[10527.91s -> 10554.57s]  hot lava. I'm going to laugh my ass off if hot lava is a bad game. At least it's a game. What's
[10554.57s -> 10562.98s]  this then? You can make a game out of anything. Guys, I could make a game out of sit like 10 or
[10563.62s -> 10566.98s]  do you go to like preschool? You can make, who can count to 10 the fastest?
[10568.46s -> 10574.28s]  That's a game. I'm going to throw this cup in the air and catch it. I'm going to make up a game
[10574.28s -> 10584.18s]  called throw the cup in the air and catch the cup. I just played a game. I mean, you can make a game
[10584.18s -> 10590.20s]  than anything. How about leak all photos? That's a game. Leak all photos, personal photos to my
[10590.20s -> 10615.40s]  Twitter. I mean, that's a game. Wait. All right. We're almost there. I got it. I'm eating spit.
[10617.50s -> 10624.17s]  There we go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, more of this. I just got to get to a point where I can
[10624.17s -> 10632.92s]  beat it. All right. Cap that up. All right. We are going. What? I have to beat the giant. The giant
[10632.92s -> 10641.11s]  is boss 14. Thank you. Quack. Thank you. Quack up for the five community subs. Thank you. Quack.
[10641.11s -> 10652.47s]  We're good. But thank you. Quack. I have to beat this guy. Just give me a minute. Rebirth 20,000.
[10652.55s -> 10661.40s]  Not bad. Not good. Not great. Pull this down. More into here. Just dump every point. I'm at
[10661.40s -> 10671.11s]  almost the cap. 15, 15. What does he have for? Oh, my inventory. Fuck. Cubes. How many cubes
[10671.11s -> 10678.82s]  are there? How many times can I merge the cube? 69 accessory. LOL. Oh, huh. What's this at? 64,
[10683.75s -> 10699.77s]  69. Yeah. This is special. I mean, energy speed is important. 35. I have 16. His defense is
[10699.77s -> 10706.47s]  not good. I just need to have some more. Um, I have to have more defense. That'll help. Equip
[10706.47s -> 10718.47s]  the poop. If I hear the word poop one more time, I am going to be very, very, very angry. Here it
[10718.47s -> 10723.35s]  comes. Now we're all going to write it. Right? That's, that's the joke, right? Streamer says the
[10723.35s -> 10729.43s]  thing. Don't do this. Oh, if I hear that again. You guys do this one more time and then everybody
[10729.43s -> 10744.36s]  does it. You won't be hearing anything because the chat is audio. Is it not audio? Here we go. Uh,
[10744.36s -> 10751.51s]  I should be able to do it now. Come on. Drain, drain, drain, drain, drain, drain, drain, drain.
[10751.51s -> 10765.42s]  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. Almost there. Get this up. All right. I'm at the cap. We're almost going to
[10765.42s -> 10772.57s]  minimize this game. We're going to minimize this and right behind it is going to be Doki Doki Literature
[10772.57s -> 10799.91s]  Club. Look at this shit eating grid. Done. Okay. I got it. Now all we have to do is allocate our
[10799.91s -> 10813.42s]  points correctly. I have 1550. I want like, fuck, 700, 800 here. I want like 800, 750 here. Good.
[10813.42s -> 10818.22s]  We're going to let this run in the background. I'm going to kill this guy. He's now going to be dead.
[10818.22s -> 10826.14s]  The giant has been vanquished. Rat of unusual size is the next boss. Okay. How many rebirth
[10826.14s -> 10834.23s]  points did that get me? Not very many, but enough. Now we wait. We sit. I clean up my inventory
[10835.40s -> 10841.35s]  and then we upgrade everything. This is at full toughness. Not anymore. Now I can do another one.
[10843.18s -> 10852.94s]  Go into here. All right. Let it run in the background. See, I'm a man of my word. We're
[10852.94s -> 10864.50s]  going to play hot lava. All right. Hold on. Just give me one sec. I need to like not capture this.
[10865.14s -> 10872.36s]  Okay. It might be loud. I'm just going to warn you because I can't turn it off right now.
[10873.26s -> 10877.66s]  And this music is also going to be turned off as well because there's music in hot lava.
[10877.66s -> 10883.86s]  I have to change the name of the title of the game to hot lava. Wait, this is on steam. Can I
[10883.86s -> 10894.41s]  not, can I run two games on steam at the same time? Wait, you can. I thought, wait, can you,
[10894.41s -> 10899.69s]  I thought maybe back. Let's try. See what happens. It's going to be loud. It's going to be loud. It's
[10899.69s -> 10971.26s]  going to be loud. Hold on. I'll turn it off. Right. Okay. Oh fuck. I'm sorry. There. Should I even move
[10971.26s -> 10978.70s]  the camera? Whatever. I'm already in that same spot. All right. Let's go. This is hot lava. It's
[10978.70s -> 11032.17s]  a game about parkouring. This just looks like I'm like a stock trader and I'm so obsessed with
[11032.17s -> 11036.33s]  keeping up to date on like the tickers and the, and the ups and downs that I have to have it on
[11036.33s -> 11045.53s]  the screen. I can't miss anything. I am a forex trader. What if it goes down by 0.2 cents and I
[11045.53s -> 11060.55s]  don't fucking sell it. All right. Let's do it. You have no friends. Gym class. I don't know how any
[11060.55s -> 11077.58s]  of this works. I can't hear. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got to hold on. I got to turn
[11077.58s -> 11092.44s]  the, uh, that, uh, okay. That's all right. That's not terrible. No, no, no, no, no. Don't discard.
[11093.24s -> 11107.86s]  Okay. Uh, how do I, okay. So WASD. Am I crouching? How many milliseconds? Milliseconds?
[11108.58s -> 11113.61s]  Somebody just got killed. What do you mean somebody got killed? There's no lava yet.
[11113.61s -> 11134.14s]  Is there a sprint? No. Uh, what do I need to do? Is this teaching me how to play? I think this is
[11134.94s -> 11141.21s]  a, all right. Trampoline trouble. Oh, it's like Mario. It's like Super Mario when you
[11141.21s -> 11154.73s]  go through the painting. All right. What's this one? Gym Jam. Make your way to the gym and we'll
[11154.73s -> 11168.89s]  run through some basics of the game. All right. Let's go. All right. Monka S. How do I play?
[11170.34s -> 11177.02s]  Don't touch the lava. Who are you? Wait, this is a multiplayer game.
[11177.74s -> 11193.85s]  Press action to skip. I went into the lava. There are people in this game.
[11196.26s -> 11207.02s]  Swing like Indy. I know you wanna. Jump to grab ropes and pipes. All right. That's cool.
[11207.66s -> 11217.53s]  What's next? That person, that person's hacking. Oh, there's a pipe. Crouch or jump to get off of
[11217.53s -> 11228.07s]  a pipe. Hold forward when jumping to launch forward. Easy. I still have, wait what? Swing
[11228.07s -> 11254.84s]  on the bars. Swing with forward and back. So I can go like this. Jump at the correct time
[11254.84s -> 11260.23s]  on the trampolines to go hot. When you jump on the, jump on the trampoline at the correct time.
[11260.23s -> 11269.37s]  What do you mean the correct time? Oh, I see. Like you just have to jump on it like that and like
[11269.37s -> 11280.60s]  that. Moss. Putty is sticky. Use it to jump off walls. Oh, keep looking straight ahead to keep
[11280.60s -> 11286.95s]  your momentum so it's like a surf. Oh, all right. That's cool. You can slide a short distance when
[11287.03s -> 11304.26s]  stuck to a wall. Sick. How are these people in my game? Oh, is this a checkpoint or something?
[11305.06s -> 11319.94s]  They're just ghosts. What do you mean ghosts? Should I go this way? Whoa, the hell? I got the
[11319.94s -> 11328.97s]  golden pin. I got the golden pin. I found a golden pin. So this is a slider. Oh shit. Okay. Is that
[11328.97s -> 11368.66s]  speed? What's on the bottom? Oh, this way. Okay. Got it. I'm going too far. Oh shit. Got it. This
[11368.66s -> 11376.76s]  is actually pretty fun. Rank two. New character available. New world available. Playground.
[11377.32s -> 11387.91s]  Playful Nya Nya. Watermelon. Nature's candy. Slow clap. Bravo. A martial artist. Must have
[11387.91s -> 11399.53s]  one for taking down the bad guys. I did it. He's trying so hard. Me?
[11404.86s -> 11429.16s]  Okay. I unlocked trampoline trouble. That's 3.2 million coming up. All right. For a second,
[11429.16s -> 11442.04s]  I thought it was still on the screen. Okay. So let's go to the next one over here. He's addicted
[11442.04s -> 11447.85s]  to the idle game for today. I'll never play it ever again after today. All right. Trampoline
[11447.85s -> 11460.76s]  trouble. This is the first real test. And that was pathetic. That was just pathetic. You can throw it
[11460.76s -> 11465.88s]  further than that. Seriously. All right. Does it, does it count if it's not a basketball?
[11466.52s -> 11477.72s]  I don't need the achievement. I don't care. Oh, this is count. Time is counting right now.
[11483.46s -> 11505.51s]  Up. Up. Well, no, there's no players in here anymore. Turn off the piano. You want to turn
[11505.51s -> 11528.39s]  the music off. I don't know where the fuck it is. Where'd it go? That way? Uh, what was that? Oops.
[11530.63s -> 11539.11s]  Trampolines. One. Two. Switch the screens. One? Are we talking about switch? One?
[11539.91s -> 11545.08s]  What do you mean switch? What are you saying? What are you going to switch my screen?
[11546.42s -> 11552.74s]  How is this worse than the number game? I told you. I told you that this was going to happen.
[11565.83s -> 11587.19s]  I told you. I can play this game in the corner. I, just give me like 20 minutes.
[11588.47s -> 11608.98s]  Just split screen it. Do a, like an old co-op game. Who's playing the piano? I don't know.
[11608.98s -> 11634.97s]  Complete it in under a minute. I'll try it. Go. One minute. Gah! What the fuck? Oh, right.
[11635.69s -> 11688.90s]  Cross. Second trampoline. Watch this. It's a tricky jump. There it is. Turn it across. Bingo.
[11688.90s -> 11717.88s]  Last one. Did it. What? What are you showing me here? It keeps doing the face. This is a new
[11717.88s -> 11750.26s]  emotion. My fucking God. I did not look like that. Do I look like this? Holy shit. I'm being like,
[11750.26s -> 11761.54s]  sucked into a tube. I'm being sucked into a fucking, like, tunnel. Oh, all you need is to
[11761.54s -> 11780.15s]  have like, air sounds. Like, look at this photo and listen to this shit. What the fuck, man?
[11780.71s -> 11786.23s]  This is why I don't have face cam turned on. Ever. Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. And I mean,
[11786.23s -> 11806.62s]  ever. Because I just look like a fucking sicko. All right, what was I doing? Right, over here.
[11807.58s -> 11813.34s]  I don't know. I looked over at my OBS and I saw that huge yellow and orange explosion. I thought
[11813.34s -> 11818.46s]  that was a huge bit thing. I thought that was like 10,000 bits. I was about to thank somebody.
[11819.42s -> 11839.13s]  All right. Let me add this. This is the noise that I hear when I see this image.
[11847.27s -> 11867.48s]  No! No, please no! I don't want to get sucked up! Thanks for that image. I won. Over here. What
[11867.48s -> 11880.22s]  I got for rebirth? 8.6 fucking million. Holy shit, my neck. I, I know, man. I know.
[11881.02s -> 11885.96s]  Wait, let me just make sure this is all good. Okay, not good yet. This gives more training.
[11887.02s -> 11895.48s]  Okay, spend experience. 44, 10k. Guys, I need to make this bigger so you can see,
[11895.48s -> 11905.35s]  because it's important to me. This is important to me. Important to me. Why is it still taking
[11905.35s -> 11926.60s]  over my computer? What the fuck are you talking about? I'm about to do 10,000 energy. Just kidding.
[11927.24s -> 11933.98s]  What do I do? I have 44 experience. What do I do? Put both games in the corner. No,
[11934.70s -> 11957.40s]  I'm going to do base energy. Energy speed. Good. All right, back to what I was doing.
[11961.88s -> 11967.50s]  Keep it like that. No, I'm not going to keep it like that. Let's go. I got the sculpted
[11967.50s -> 11975.58s]  plastic construction means no mustache wax required item. All right, so that was good.
[11978.58s -> 11991.59s]  Missing, where's the music? Okay, save those changes. All right, I want to, I want to,
[11991.59s -> 11995.83s]  want to, want to, want to, what do I want to do? Open gym, do whatever you want. Run, jump, swing.
[11996.63s -> 12003.27s]  Completed in under two minutes and 10 seconds. Don't die. Let's five star this shit.
[12004.79s -> 12016.04s]  No dying. Off the ladder. That's going to happen again. I need to like, I need to control my face.
[12017.00s -> 12037.91s]  I know it's going to happen again. Got to be slow. This one. Two minutes, right? I can do that.
[12037.91s -> 12054.12s]  That's easy. What the fuck I was grabbing onto it. Last try. What's this game called?
[12058.09s -> 12077.13s]  That person just fucked me up. That person just screwed me up. I can do this. Just do it simple.
[12077.13s -> 12085.82s]  Two minutes is a long time. This is like the mousepads coming off of the goddamn thing.
[12091.06s -> 12174.81s]  I know, get off the screen. My momentum is gone. Skip. I was right here too. God, come on. New
[12174.81s -> 12190.10s]  unlock. What are these? What do they do? These unlocks? I'm using a default avatar.
[12190.98s -> 12197.69s]  Yeah, I'm not, I don't, I'm not paying for it. Just don't die. I don't just beat it at any time.
[12197.69s -> 12224.58s]  Just don't die. Do it slow. Hair is getting in my face. How am I making it worse? Who the fuck is
[12224.58s -> 12257.00s]  this? Wait, is that me? I got to beat this motherfucker. Got it. Oh, he got confused over
[12257.00s -> 12280.17s]  there. No deaths. No deaths and beat the time. How are we doing on the idle game? That was me.
[12280.17s -> 12298.04s]  I got a thumbtack. 120. Now start strafing and bhopping. I think you're asking a little much.
[12299.58s -> 12312.10s]  Wait, 43 million. Another 10 minutes here. All right, that's good. Fight the boss. Fight it.
[12312.10s -> 12317.98s]  I can't fight it yet. Keep it going. Keep it going. What about inventory? Oh, not good. Hold on. Just
[12317.98s -> 12326.30s]  combine everything really quickly. Hat. Hat. Into here. Here. Here. Sword. Boots. Cube.
[12327.74s -> 12338.79s]  Toughness. Cube. Ring. Ring. 64. Combine. I got to combine the swords up here. One. Toughness.
[12338.79s -> 12343.03s]  No, that's special. I can do this once more. Special is already, is there any more specials
[12343.03s -> 12353.48s]  I can do? Yep. The hat. Speed bonus. Looking good. Pants. Cube. Keep it going. We're done. I'm ready.
[12358.52s -> 12367.50s]  Prank caller. Is somebody prank calling me? What do you mean? Do a third game in another window.
[12369.80s -> 12372.76s]  I can't. No, I'm not going to be able to do that. All right. I got to go over here and
[12372.76s -> 12379.80s]  get five stars on this one. I'm pretty good at this game, I think. I don't even know. I don't
[12379.80s -> 12384.76s]  know what the... What are the... Don't perform any swings. Don't die and grab the golden pin.
[12386.81s -> 12400.36s]  No swinging. What the fuck am I supposed to do that? No swinging? And don't die. My profile picture.
[12400.36s -> 12407.50s]  Yeah, my profile picture is an awesome way to hide online. Golden pin is probably the home line.
[12407.50s -> 12428.66s]  Because that... That's a default Team Fortress 2 avatar. Oh, I can't land on that. I have to do
[12428.66s -> 12454.78s]  like that. Oh, wrong. Just don't swing. Don't swing. Okay. I didn't swing. I'm just trying
[12454.78s -> 12492.30s]  to get one of them. No swings. Didn't say anything about bouncing, right? New world school.
[12493.93s -> 12506.38s]  Okay, I'm gonna go to my avatar and do some stuff. It's the same image. You just stretch
[12506.38s -> 12519.21s]  the sides of my mouth. I have to rebirth this in... When this gets to 60 minutes, I'm doing rebirth.
[12519.21s -> 12524.01s]  And then I'm changing over here. We're gonna do the same thing. We just... Now this one will be
[12524.01s -> 12533.91s]  in the corner. This one will be bigger. Not now yet. Not yet. Not now. You've got so many emotes.
[12533.91s -> 12539.27s]  I don't even know what I would call that. What would you... What would that emote even be called?
[12539.27s -> 12562.26s]  Dermatube? Dermassuction? Dermassour? I can't like... I like... Dermassour is the best one.
[12564.31s -> 12571.05s]  All right. I'm gonna... It's gonna be there tomorrow. I have 24 hours to do that. All right.
[12571.05s -> 12576.20s]  Back to the boss. Okay. I don't... You guys don't even... You don't need to see this shit.
[12577.08s -> 12581.96s]  It's taken away. You can see... I want you to go... This was the time. All right. New zone. Wait. I
[12581.96s -> 12605.14s]  want to go to the... Menu? Yeah. Toy shelf. Lex Flora. All right. We're doing the seagull head.
[12605.78s -> 12617.03s]  Moustache pin. Thumbs down. Blue laser. I don't have it. Watermelon in the background. Sounds good.
[12621.51s -> 12627.88s]  Let's go! Playground. Gym class. There's a lot of fucking stuff in this game, huh?
[12631.18s -> 12653.10s]  Damn. That's been debunked. Why is the camera mirrored? Because we were playing a different
[12653.10s -> 12657.42s]  game before and it had to be mirrored as I was looking in the right spot. All right. New place
[12657.42s -> 12669.51s]  unlocked. Where is it? I got five in there. Not gonna get five up there. This way? Which is the
[12669.51s -> 12683.13s]  level? Didn't I unlock it down here? There we go. What's the yellow bar at the bottom? I don't know.
[12683.85s -> 12695.53s]  I don't know. Balance? Maybe it's balance. Jump timing? Wait. You mean like...
[12696.49s -> 12715.88s]  You actually do bunny hop. Well, that's advanced techniques you're not gonna get on this screen.
[12715.88s -> 12742.36s]  Sorry. Almost. I think you gotta do that though. From here to here? And then twice?
[12743.00s -> 12753.24s]  No. All the way across. Yeah. Okay. I guess that is advanced technique. Wait. Is there something
[12753.24s -> 12769.26s]  over here? Did I skip the whole thing? I think I skipped the whole level. Just win. I'm trying.
[12769.98s -> 12797.66s]  I'm trying to just win. This used to be a numbers going upstream. Feels bad, man.
[12799.19s -> 12809.16s]  Yeah. Fist bump. It's still going on in the background. We'll be checking in on it soon.
[12812.47s -> 12821.85s]  God. I missed that game. Grab the golden pin. I can't do that. So a new session over here.
[12822.65s -> 12828.12s]  What do I do to get this? Requirement beads. Surfing surfaces. Oh, this one's gonna be held.
[12828.76s -> 12858.42s]  Pogo? Pogo stick? So it's not just jumping. There's items too. Wait. Shit. This is weird.
[12864.62s -> 12883.05s]  Whoa. That was fun. Easy mode. Celebrate your minor victory. So I'm assuming I need to use that
[12883.05s -> 12891.08s]  somewhere else. So this is a sliding level. Use the sliding surfaces. I keep seeing that picture
[12891.08s -> 12904.71s]  over here and it's freaking me the fuck out. Oh, fuck. Landing on surf objects from higher
[12904.71s -> 12915.21s]  makes you go faster. Right? What? Oh, I'm bunny hopping now. He figured it out, folks.
[12919.94s -> 12933.06s]  Damn. That was crazy. Flick away from objects to disconnect and keep your speed.
[12933.94s -> 12961.86s]  Flick away from objects. Flick away. Flick it in your hand. There we go.
[12961.86s -> 12978.49s]  People are going to get really good at something like this. Wholesale.
[12979.21s -> 12995.50s]  Clown shoes. Better put those on immediately. Hole bulb. What else is over here? This opened up.
[12996.22s -> 13007.69s]  Oh, what's this? Tiny toy trial. Get to the finish line. Tiny toy. If you're good at something,
[13007.69s -> 13021.80s]  they would do it for free. I agree. We're in third person? That was a battery. Oh, I get speed.
[13022.60s -> 13065.88s]  Do I have to do this in a certain amount of time? No. The music is playing based on my speed. That
[13065.88s -> 13102.55s]  is cool. I need to go faster though. No. I got to start back here. Got it. Was this the don't
[13102.55s -> 13115.34s]  starve devs? Really? That's kind of interesting. That's cool. Whoa. Did you see? He went so fast.
[13116.22s -> 13124.38s]  Do that again. Do that again every day. Five times a day. All right. Pole ball.
[13124.38s -> 13151.82s]  So here are the poles. And how do I? Oh, shit. What? How do I just stand on top?
[13164.60s -> 13199.61s]  And he's been drinking. I haven't. I've been drinking coffee. This is why I can't have a
[13199.61s -> 13210.06s]  face cam on. I'm too strange. I can feel how strange I'm being. But before I wouldn't care
[13210.06s -> 13230.74s]  because I wouldn't be on camera. Becoming odd. I'm unlocking worlds. I'm doing a whole lot of good
[13230.74s -> 13249.02s]  here. Cowboy hat. Knapsack. Dragon horns. Chase your sister. I can do that in a minute and 10
[13249.02s -> 13335.78s]  seconds. Break through. No deaths either. What the fuck is in my way? Did I do it? I didn't lose to
[13335.78s -> 13383.75s]  the ghost. I didn't get it. Minute and 10 seconds. Get the fuck in there. Restart. Trying to go too
[13383.75s -> 13458.01s]  fast. Get it! Okay. God damn it. I fucking hit my face. I got a minute and 10. Three seconds to spare.
[13460.82s -> 13467.78s]  All right. I got three out of that one. What's chasing my sister down here? All right. This
[13467.78s -> 13472.18s]  one's called chase your sister. This is called intermediate difficulty. Okay. Try to catch me.
[13472.74s -> 13499.30s]  This one's hard. Go for the hard one. When do we start? I had it too. I was doing pretty well.
[13499.62s -> 13505.96s]  Come on. Up. Over. I gotta land these bunny hops better too.
[13507.10s -> 13532.65s]  Fucking idiot. I'm so mad. Did he have a meltdown already? No. No meltdowns tonight.
[13546.31s -> 13549.43s]  All right. All right. Stop paying attention to the fucking bunny hop. You're never gonna get it.
[13549.43s -> 13647.40s]  Fuck it. Just go. She was waiting for me to taunt me. Cry. Cry. Cry. Cry. Cry. Oh, I think he's gonna
[13647.40s -> 13668.25s]  fucking cry. What the fuck am I doing? You're like half the bunny hop otherwise you can't make that
[13668.25s -> 13719.21s]  jump. Go back to the numbers game. Fuck. It's counting in the background. It's gotta focus
[13719.21s -> 13808.02s]  completely. No talking. No streaming. Just do it. Damn it. All right. If I try to bunny hop one more
[13808.02s -> 13837.90s]  time I am just just go. Just do it. I'm not going. No. Just do it. It probably on camera looks like
[13837.90s -> 13846.30s]  I'm trying to get a piece of popcorn out of my fucking teeth at the movie theater. Like I'm making
[13846.30s -> 13890.68s]  fucking jokes. This is the one right here. Flashy. Itchy nose. Inside of my nose is itching like
[13890.68s -> 13932.57s]  crazy. I just snorted itching powder. Somebody said who the fuck are you? Oh no. Now I can't lose
[13932.57s -> 13957.58s]  because this person's gonna show me up. Look at that. Great head. They fell. They fell. They fell.
[13957.58s -> 13974.63s]  Okay. Now I don't feel bad. It was that easy. That was not even that hard. I made that way harder
[13974.63s -> 13992.15s]  on myself. He was literally pretending. Did you see the other guy fall? Pretending. The guy in
[13992.15s -> 14014.78s]  front of me too. Guy went like this. Okay. What's in here? No. All right. There it is. New session.
[14014.78s -> 14021.48s]  New little mini game here. All course marathon. No. I know what this is and I don't want to do it.
[14022.42s -> 14085.93s]  Difficulty impossible. This is impossible. How is this impossible? That's why I'm not doing it.
[14085.93s -> 14093.11s]  All right. What's up Adidas? What's over here? I see a door hit this way. What's in the what's
[14093.11s -> 14109.21s]  in the computer lab? I don't know. I've been down here, right? What's left in here? I think I've
[14109.21s -> 14115.64s]  seen everything. Play the numbers. No, no, no. We're just going to keep that one counting.
[14118.34s -> 14139.42s]  Maybe one, maybe one little peek. Maybe just a little peek, you know? How are we doing? All
[14139.42s -> 14149.59s]  right. I got two quadrillion. Ooh, hold on. Rebirth. 145 fucking million for rebirth. Okay.
[14150.70s -> 14157.16s]  Experience. 10 exp. We're going to do energy speed and we're going to do it again. We're going to do
[14157.16s -> 14166.54s]  a few times. I'm going to go back over here to fight boss. What do we need? 317 versus 148.
[14167.10s -> 14173.45s]  273. I need a little, I mean, I need more defense. This is going to be close, but I need defense.
[14173.45s -> 14180.01s]  So I'm going to go into here. Basic training. Pull this out. Put it in here. Just we got to
[14180.01s -> 14185.72s]  get a little bit more defense. Money pit. A million bucks is going in the money pit. Dump.
[14186.36s -> 14192.20s]  You gain plus a zero one health regen. Okay. I can have two hours from now. I have to come back
[14192.20s -> 14203.35s]  and do this again. That looks all right. Fight boss. 15. Let's see what happens.
[14206.17s -> 14216.39s]  No, stop, stop, stop. That's not worth it. I have a hundred more than he does. And then my defense
[14216.39s -> 14227.50s]  is 160 less. So we need to wait till I get this a little higher, but I got a strong attack now.
[14228.54s -> 14233.46s]  What does this one do? Base attack received is 2000 instead of a thousand.
[14235.43s -> 14252.98s]  Holy shit. Yeah. Yeah. Let's dump it into that. We can't see. Re. Yes, you can. Look. All right.
[14253.70s -> 14264.65s]  Uh, that's all right. I think that's fine. Fight boss. I'll have enough here. 300. I'll have enough.
[14266.04s -> 14271.56s]  I might have enough now. No, I'm going down faster. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. We'll,
[14271.56s -> 14275.66s]  we'll come back to it. Oh, you better believe we're going to be doing it again,
[14277.26s -> 14286.87s]  but never again after today. I mean, like actually never again after today. All right.
[14288.52s -> 14306.97s]  Oh, to the next world, wherever that is. Can I just put the menu? Okay.
[14308.79s -> 14319.70s]  Play the playground. Ooh, this one looks cool. Really? I get to slide on the slide.
[14320.58s -> 14332.04s]  You ready to play with the big kids? Don't embarrass me. Okay. Let's go. Ooh, chess.
[14332.76s -> 14358.15s]  That one. This one's called recess. It does take like a backpack. Fuck. Okay. You got to
[14358.15s -> 14368.57s]  jump around across the person. Got my way. I'm going to wait because me and this guy are on the
[14368.57s -> 14391.69s]  exact same. We're doing it at the same time. I'm going to go around the card. Did I not get it?
[14391.69s -> 14414.01s]  What the fuck did I not get that? I don't, where was, where was the thing to grab? Oh, I missed it.
[14414.01s -> 14432.62s]  It was right here. Whoa. I used to get the cards. How the fuck does this work? Climb it. Climb it.
[14433.26s -> 14452.02s]  Down the slide or riot. Down the slide or riot. I can hear you. Holy shit actually is down the slide.
[14452.74s -> 14469.56s]  Where's the, over there. I don't even have to go this way. I have to go to the tires. I'm dead.
[14469.56s -> 14518.01s]  Fall damage. I died. There we go. I just broke. My neck just like broke. Ah, it's so painful.
[14522.58s -> 14540.58s]  Learn to bunny hop or get the fuck out. Right? Card. Learn to scrape or get the fuck out.
[14546.39s -> 14549.59s]  What's the purpose of bunny hopping? I think it just keeps your momentum and you just keep
[14549.59s -> 14561.80s]  going faster and faster and faster and faster and faster. I think you unlock the big kids slide.
[14561.80s -> 14584.78s]  That sounds like fun one. Wait, let me do this. I can get at least one cool thing.
[14587.32s -> 14594.36s]  Oh, which one did I unlock? Where'd it go? Big kids slide. I think it's the big kids slide.
[14600.82s -> 14610.94s]  Apple. Forget about books. Give me the apple. What the hell is this place over here?
[14611.90s -> 14624.52s]  Always pick up an apple. Always. So if I just run on the ground. I'm getting momentum just
[14624.52s -> 14656.14s]  by running. Wait a second. Okay. So you have to be running a certain amount of speed first.
[14662.14s -> 14668.95s]  Admin, he's doing it sideways. Am I not supposed to be doing that? I always thought bunny hopping
[14668.95s -> 14673.67s]  was you have to like move your camera around. Like you have to flick your face around to like
[14673.75s -> 14682.12s]  get momentum to like throw yourself. Is that correct? You do. You do. You do. Okay.
[14699.98s -> 14702.70s]  I could see how people would get obsessed with this game.
[14703.90s -> 14718.12s]  Just trying to get every single damn thing. Where are we even going?
[14718.12s -> 14727.83s]  It's like you've become so obsessed with trying to. Oh man. There are probably people that are
[14727.83s -> 14733.83s]  going to be just bunny hopping with like times 10 speed and just drape up this thing. It ain't
[14733.83s -> 14760.34s]  going to be me. I will never do that. Not down. Slide down slide. Slide down. This really is
[14760.34s -> 14785.98s]  just kind of an open playing field. All right. Did you hear that? Somebody had to have heard
[14785.98s -> 14820.62s]  that. That was like a snapped neck. Back this way. Sorry. I did the same thing. These levels,
[14820.62s -> 14824.94s]  this one was weird. It's like Tony Hawk level. You kind of can just go anywhere you want.
[14826.12s -> 14842.06s]  But there's one goal. Checkpoint 15 of 19. Enough momentum. That's fucking hard to do.
[14855.53s -> 14883.14s]  Get on the trash can. I can't grab that pole. What? I thought it was a grabble pole. Just play
[14883.14s -> 14893.16s]  Tony Hawk instead. I could play Tony Hawk, but I don't think I can right now. I'm currently
[14893.16s -> 14907.78s]  playing hot lava. How the fuck do you get up there? Wait a minute. Just start from there.
[14907.78s -> 14929.40s]  Bounce bounce bounce. I guess this way. No. What? I gotta see that. I'm getting the Mario music.
[14929.40s -> 14951.10s]  The Mario like hurry up music. That's what I just landed on. Numbers go up waiting room. Yeah. Cool
[14951.10s -> 14957.86s]  stream. Can I have your Xbox? Like you mean you actually physically want my Xbox? Why would I
[14957.86s -> 14971.08s]  give you my Xbox? He's another pogo level. You don't want this thing. All right. This is a
[14971.08s -> 15006.25s]  checkpoint with pogo stick. Let's do it. Just trying to keep up speed. This is like an exact
[15006.25s -> 15051.54s]  route you take too with this shit. I gotta go. We're all nauseating. My head. What's going on?
[15052.26s -> 15078.33s]  Why is this doing this? He's like a dog's asshole. Where did it open?
[15078.97s -> 15092.62s]  Anybody see it? Can you guys, can you tell me what the next step thing is?
[15092.62s -> 15113.06s]  They can't hear me right? Is it over here? Chase the big kid. All right. This is freaking me out.
[15113.06s -> 15128.36s]  Quit the menu. Toy shop. Let's put on some new stuff. I'll stick with the bandana guy. Horns.
[15128.36s -> 15141.77s]  Hat. I like the hat. Staff. Backpack. Keyboard. This is rare. Keyboard. What's this? Sneakers.
[15142.49s -> 15150.02s]  Yeah. Cool. Sneakers. Fist pump. And I want the easy button behind me. Nice.
[15153.93s -> 15164.28s]  Let's go to school. Sounds like a fun time to me. I also have to piss again.
[15170.12s -> 15188.89s]  You look like Woody from Toy Story. ABC's one two threes. All right. Let's do it. I'm
[15188.89s -> 15206.55s]  starting to get like a dungeon. By the way, this is the first song you learn on any guitar.
[15206.55s -> 15212.39s]  It's the first like four chords. Chords. Chords. Chords. It's the first four chords you learn.
[15213.35s -> 15256.26s]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, come on. Thank God. It just helps you.
[15256.98s -> 15277.51s]  You gotta get up top. Oh, I'm getting, I'm getting actually upset right now.
[15277.51s -> 15306.15s]  This used to be a fucking counting screen. Bounce from where do you want to bounce to?
[15307.11s -> 15355.74s]  No, we bolted the same exact thing at the same exact fucking time. Okay. He's waiting for me.
[15356.30s -> 15400.95s]  I went the wrong way. Fuck you. Chair. Is that lava there? I'm so confused. So I understand the
[15400.95s -> 15406.33s]  whole like the floor is lava gimmick. Does the floor actually have to be lava in this game?
[15406.97s -> 15425.24s]  Why can't it just be don't touch the floor? Hey. Throw shit. Why can't it just be don't touch the
[15425.32s -> 15437.27s]  red floor? I know it fucks up the whole thing. Otherwise, it would just be a Counter-Strike map.
[15437.91s -> 15455.14s]  It would just be a Garry's Mod custom game. I need momentum to get up there. Wait, guys. Wait for
[15455.14s -> 15485.64s]  me. Don't leave without me. Wait for me. Wait. Don't leave. Wait for me. I got it. I didn't
[15485.64s -> 15507.37s]  touch it. What? How did I not touch this? I need to put on my own music. This music is just like,
[15508.23s -> 15513.75s]  I feel like this is like a car commercial on the radio. Hold on. I got to get my own
[15513.75s -> 15526.57s]  fucking music in here. What do I want? What do I want from music? The piano. The piano is better
[15526.57s -> 15538.31s]  than music. No, not Minecraft. It's something that's going to pump me up. How about, no,
[15538.31s -> 15552.62s]  not Tony Hawk. That's how you get the whole stream turned off. Sonic? What's that song? Who's the
[15552.62s -> 15557.02s]  band that does all the Sonic songs? There's one band that's been doing every single theme song
[15557.02s -> 15560.86s]  for like 10 years. What's that band called? Anybody know the name of that band? What's that
[15560.86s -> 15577.29s]  band's name? By Crush 40. All right. Is this going to make the whole stream going to turn off?
[15587.78s -> 15596.12s]  Will it? Whatever. It's hot lava. I'm not like composing Mozart on this stream today.
[15614.12s -> 15619.02s]  Why does it feel like it's playing twice? I think I'm losing my mind.
[15619.98s -> 15641.22s]  Why will you truly follow your peace and pain
[15643.46s -> 15647.70s]  when you can't help but swallow?
[15649.22s -> 15651.54s]  If it's right that way, you can.
[15651.70s -> 15681.85s]  It's. Sing it. I need to go up that way. Something, something, whatever it is.
[15683.14s -> 15686.58s]  Do Twitch sings. I don't, I don't, I don't, I have no idea how to do that.
[15687.62s -> 15731.16s]  Plus that's an embarrassment strings. And this is not. Has it done how to bunny hop? Is that,
[15731.16s -> 15751.43s]  is that the jab there? And you see how many millions I have here? Hey, is this embarrassing?
[15751.43s -> 15759.32s]  378 trillion attack power. Is that an embarrassment? Speaking of.
[15773.62s -> 15791.58s]  Done. 443 million. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's coming up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[15794.22s -> 15804.79s]  Oh no, it's a long. Yeah. All right. Let's keep going. Money pit. I got an hour and 30
[15804.79s -> 15808.47s]  before I can do the money put again. What about this? No, I can't even attempt
[15809.19s -> 15812.55s]  10 experience. Let's go with I'm going to wait for 15.
[15817.72s -> 15825.83s]  I should rebirth now. Look at that. So fucking huge. That's it. Exponentially increased. My
[15825.83s -> 15836.25s]  inventory is fucking messed up. And what about special? I can do one more of these.
[15838.04s -> 15841.48s]  No special in any of the other ones. Any power in the sword,
[15842.04s -> 15849.30s]  toughness in the pants, combined boots, combined chest, pants, pants, pants, put it on
[15850.62s -> 15859.74s]  toughness, three out of seven, combine the cube, special, get in there, boots, helmet, sword.
[15860.70s -> 15868.26s]  Now let's take a little bit of an inventory here. We need toughness, toughness, special,
[15870.98s -> 15876.70s]  sword, special. We're going to put this. I don't think I can put this anywhere.
[15877.50s -> 15887.38s]  No, I can. We're good. This is now impossible. I've done my points. I wait. Not yet.
[15888.18s -> 15896.39s]  That was it. Somebody tell me. I thought I was wrong.
[15898.46s -> 15911.50s]  Yeah, there it is right there. All right. Let's get going. I'll come back in another 20 minutes.
[15914.25s -> 15921.70s]  And then I want to play this. I want to play. I want to play this game.
[15942.73s -> 15950.86s]  Wasn't it? Oh yeah. Escape from the city. That's the one, right? What's it called?
[15955.46s -> 15967.45s]  Escape the city. And this is the one that goes rolling around at the speed of sound, right?
[15967.45s -> 16002.23s]  Something like that. Let's go.
[16033.30s -> 16046.94s]  Do I do there?
[16067.50s -> 16086.01s]  Mobile viewers posting lyrics too late. I'm going to watch you. How are you doing this?
[16086.01s -> 16127.98s]  I see. I'm trying to follow them. Something going to autoplay.
[16141.96s -> 16145.48s]  Stop throwing shit at me. I've got it. It's tough enough as it is for me.
[16154.81s -> 16158.73s]  I bounced backwards. I need more Sonic the Hedgehog theme music for me to be able to do this.
[16159.37s -> 16199.35s]  This one has seven million views. What is this one? Seven fucking million. Oh, I know.
[16233.40s -> 16246.60s]  Louder vessel. It's not helping. The beat's wrong on this one for me.
[16247.42s -> 16264.06s]  It's not helping. The other one was. My turn. Get off of that. How do I do that? All right. Up on top.
[16264.94s -> 16272.20s]  I fell off. I'm just like slippery shit. It's a slippery fucking thing.
[16279.34s -> 16295.67s]  What the fuck are you in the way for? Worst Sonic song by far. Like if there's a top five,
[16295.67s -> 16320.10s]  this is five. What's this? What's this? Fist bump. Fist bump. Sonic Forces. There was a Sonic Forces
[16320.82s -> 16397.88s]  fist bump. One second. Sorry. I have a VPN. It takes me 10 seconds to load anything. Same song.
[16398.90s -> 16413.94s]  We'll listen to the real one. I listen to this way too much. I'm not even like that. I'm not
[16413.94s -> 16428.92s]  even that big of an Undertale fan, but I listened to... Didn't help. I don't even know where the
[16428.92s -> 16479.19s]  fuck I'm supposed to go. I have to go down? I have to go over there. From here. God. What the hell?
[16480.07s -> 16486.36s]  Here this way. Let's go. So let's jump this way. Down here. Across over there. Onto the loo.
[16487.32s -> 16495.66s]  Nice. Got it. Onto the wood. Oh, I fell down. Oh, that's unfortunate. Oh well. Try it again.
[16496.62s -> 16505.06s]  Oh, so wing it. Oh, nice try. Nice try. Excellent work. Oh, almost made three points.
[16505.94s -> 16537.77s]  I just have to go over there. Bounce. I jumped over the fucking thing. How many of these did I
[16537.85s -> 16615.24s]  jump over? Why is this playing again? Why is this playing again? Boom. Look at that pace.
[16616.71s -> 16628.41s]  Don't look at that pace. Oh, it's megalovania for one hour. Now I know why. Oops. Oh, got a new
[16628.41s -> 16641.40s]  session. Middle school. Was that middle school mischief? That one was difficult. Do it, coward.
[16643.10s -> 16653.78s]  Coward. What do you mean coward? Tape your face into a neutral position. Tape your face
[16654.10s -> 16683.50s]  into a neutral position. I get what? And my eyes? Do it and I'll sub. Really? Really? You'll sub
[16683.50s -> 16692.89s]  if I do the tape on the face thing. Or I'm gonna get acne. No. What if I just stay neutral? Like
[16692.89s -> 16702.90s]  the tape residue is gonna get in my pores and I'm gonna get zits. Go get it. Get tape or no sub.
[16703.54s -> 16713.06s]  Tape. What do you mean? Why? Why do I need to tape my face into it? It clears your pores. Tape
[16713.78s -> 16721.27s]  blocks your pores because it's tape. Do it. Don't sell out. All right. So one guy just said don't
[16721.27s -> 16732.78s]  sell out. Okay. Yeah. I will not make a reaction. I will put, I put artificial tape here. No reaction.
[16732.78s -> 16740.52s]  If I do any reaction. No, I tried this before and it was fucking bad. Do you guys remember
[16740.52s -> 16749.16s]  the don't make and don't laugh at all for like 10 straight minutes? That was horrible.
[16750.81s -> 16759.34s]  All right. No. All right. I'll try it. No emotions for 10 straight minutes or I do a hundred gifted
[16759.34s -> 16779.93s]  subs. When does it start? I already fucking can't do it. Every funny thing I've ever heard in my
[16779.93s -> 16784.81s]  whole life. Every fucking awful thing that's ever happened to me. They're all flowing to the front
[16784.81s -> 16790.09s]  of my cerebral cortex right now. And they're just like, I'm ready. I'm ready. Remember the time when
[16790.09s -> 16793.85s]  you did this? Remember that funny thing? Remember the movie you watched when you really laughed?
[16793.85s -> 16800.62s]  They're all getting in here. They're all getting to the front row. That was funny, but it's not.
[16800.62s -> 16809.19s]  Okay. No music's going to make me fucking laugh too. 10 minutes straight. I need, I need to look
[16809.19s -> 16814.79s]  over. Where's my timer? Four hours and 41 minutes in the stream. I got to pee first too. This is,
[16814.79s -> 16837.19s]  I'm going all in. I'll be right back. Hey, it's Jeremy again. I'm back. I have an idea for the
[16837.19s -> 16845.10s]  only reason why I would ever do media share. A stream where I have to stay completely,
[16845.10s -> 16859.13s]  completely emotionless while you guys do media share. And you have to try to break me. Interesting
[16859.13s -> 16978.23s]  scenario. Think about that. I'll sleep on that one. I'll be right back. Okay. I'm back. Let's
[16978.23s -> 16989.72s]  give this a try. Uh, I get three strikes by the way. 10 minutes, three strikes. Yes, I do. Yes,
[16989.72s -> 16997.30s]  I do. I make the rules. Okay. I make the rules. Three strikes, 10 minutes. Cause I know it's
[16997.30s -> 17005.91s]  going to happen. Three strikes. Uh, I make the rules. You guys get to pick the music,
[17008.58s -> 17022.23s]  come to a consensus on something. How the fuck are you going to do that in five seconds? Uh,
[17023.64s -> 17032.79s]  no, not okay. What, what, what is, people keep writing this shit. What is this? Pumpkin Hill?
[17032.79s -> 17045.77s]  Pumpkin Hill, Sonic Adventure 2 music.
[17052.09s -> 17059.77s]  Okay. Pumpkin Hill. Why do I remember this song?
[17060.49s -> 17064.57s]  Cause I have no fear. This probably seems crazy, crazy. Graveyard theory.
[17068.57s -> 17072.09s]  Why is Chad's thinking the worst song? It's not me picking it.
[17076.09s -> 17089.03s]  Let's go. We're not starting yet. I'll give you a big face cam just so you guys can really,
[17089.03s -> 17089.51s]  really take a look.
[17102.04s -> 17109.37s]  I'm not allowed to. Okay. Okay. Emotionless doesn't mean I can't move my entire facial muscles.
[17110.97s -> 17121.46s]  This is going to be hard. No, emotionless means like no laughing, no getting angry, no what the
[17121.46s -> 17133.02s]  fuck? No. Oh, that was funny. Nothing. Just blank. But I can like go like this. Like I can like touch
[17133.02s -> 17146.54s]  my face and stuff. You can't smile. I won't smile. I'm a fucking four year old. You can't do that.
[17146.54s -> 17166.23s]  Now I want to do that. This thing is this, this guy sucks. This guy sucks. That's an emotion,
[17166.23s -> 17176.63s]  but it's not time. I'm waiting till the end of the song because this is cheating for you guys.
[17179.75s -> 17183.91s]  Cause it needs to be at the beginning of a new song.
[17198.54s -> 17208.78s]  It hasn't started yet. It hasn't started yet.
[17211.10s -> 17228.47s]  Fuck. No, that's not one. Let me beat this level first. Oh, I need momentum. I have to stay
[17228.47s -> 17233.75s]  completely. I gotta stay completely fucking still too. Well, that's not going to happen
[17233.75s -> 17235.19s]  because I'm a fidgeter.
[17235.67s -> 17241.38s]  I ain't going to let it get to me. I'm just going to creep down the park.
[17241.38s -> 17243.38s]  I got it. Holy shit, there's more.
[17243.38s -> 17245.86s]  I know that it's here. Rocking, sensing it in my feet.
[17245.86s -> 17251.27s]  The gray emeralds be the fear. See a thing, but it's around somewhere.
[17251.27s -> 17256.63s]  I'm gonna hold my head and fear. This prophecy turns gray. A gray dark theory.
[17256.63s -> 17264.44s]  I coast trying, but he ain't got a theory. Now that it's still a second, I'm walking to the
[17264.52s -> 17278.33s]  fuck. They look like emerald shards. Oh, I'm going to hang on to that one now.
[17278.33s -> 17283.45s]  Fuck. I need you to start it because you guys have thrown shit out there that is
[17283.45s -> 17284.97s]  it's going to, it's going to fuck with me.
[17299.88s -> 17305.32s]  Okay. I get three strikes starting. Okay. No emotion, no anger,
[17305.32s -> 17318.90s]  no frustration, no laughing like this. This, I can't fucking do this.
[17318.90s -> 17321.30s]  I can't do it. I might as well just give everybody a hundred subs right now.
[17322.26s -> 17331.05s]  It's impossible for me. There's no way I, there is confetti that's getting stuffed down here
[17332.17s -> 17335.21s]  and somebody is just going to pull the string down here and just boom.
[17335.85s -> 17338.65s]  It just builds and builds and builds and builds until like it has to come out.
[17340.70s -> 17356.70s]  Brick by brick Lego Island. OST. Is this a funny song? Okay. Starting off three strikes.
[17357.58s -> 17367.70s]  Here we go. I'm going to watch the timer here. We're 450.
[17368.50s -> 17378.52s]  I almost laughed because I had this on the screen. Just sitting here huge in front of me right now.
[17379.40s -> 17390.06s]  Here we go. In 10 seconds at 451 and then at four at 501 stream time.
[17391.16s -> 17393.64s]  I got it right here. Here we go. Starting now.
[17417.46s -> 17420.50s]  You can paint a jet ski yellow like that.
[17437.27s -> 17445.38s]  That's still part of one. That's still part of one. That's still part of one.
[17448.36s -> 17452.78s]  Alright. Why did I do this to myself?
[17453.34s -> 17471.67s]  Lego seed. When you're behind the tent. If you do it brick by brick.
[17478.71s -> 17485.16s]  Fuck. I just picture like a big fucking southern family on stage. They're like a
[17485.16s -> 17513.13s]  bang. They're like a huge cello. It's like a hunt. There's like 12 of them. They're all in the same family.
[17513.13s -> 17518.33s]  There's something you should know. When you block the road. You're going to get towed.
[17518.33s -> 17532.46s]  Brick by brick. I told Nick. You can build a brick by brick.
[17532.46s -> 17566.17s]  Machine ready yellow SD by slacks. All around the island right here. No matter. You can move a man. You can move a mountain. If you do it brick by brick.
[17743.14s -> 17769.30s]  There's somebody in fucking chat. Somebody in chat said this streamer doesn't talk. Why? Like what the fuck?
[17770.10s -> 17777.11s]  The music and just the part that I like. He's just sitting there playing like fucking shit.
[17777.91s -> 17784.65s]  I don't know why the fuck I looked at chat. I needed two and two and a half more minutes.
[17790.47s -> 17803.42s]  Hold on a second. Just keep the music playing. Double or nothing? No. I ain't playing that game anymore.
[17808.82s -> 17823.46s]  It's this music too. Like what the fuck even is this music? I'll have to do it from here. How the
[17823.46s -> 17834.07s]  fuck do I? I don't know how to do this every time. How do I even give community subs? Here we go.
[17834.07s -> 17851.96s]  I don't know why I play these fucking dangerous games with myself. I continue to play play dumb
[17851.96s -> 17898.41s]  games. You play stupid games. Gift us. Here it is. Okay. Here we go. Congratulations.
[17911.02s -> 17918.87s]  Dodged it. You dodged it. That's a free shit. I didn't get one. Do it again.
[17926.66s -> 17940.98s]  That was not a lie. No. All right. Let's keep going. I'm already subscribed. What happened to
[17940.98s -> 17954.49s]  the Lego Island music? That's a vacuum cleaner. What time is it? Five hours? How many? We got two
[17954.49s -> 17974.01s]  hours in. I gotta rebirth this. Who even gives a shit about hot lava anymore? It's good. It's a
[17974.01s -> 17988.41s]  good game. It's good. But my mind is only on numbers going up in a sequence at the moment.
[17988.41s -> 18003.21s]  Let me get to the end of this. Thanks. You got one? Thanks for the sub. Yeah. There it is.
[18003.21s -> 18013.67s]  Listen to one. Listen to one hour of vacuum without laughing. I'll do. Okay. Why is that on
[18013.67s -> 18019.85s]  screen? All right. No, not double enough. And I just did it. I'll do, I'll do two straight minutes
[18020.65s -> 18027.16s]  of vacuum cleaner sound without flinching. And if I don't do it, I'll dab on stream.
[18028.28s -> 18035.40s]  That's much better than a hundred community subs. Oh, who even gives a shit about hot? All right.
[18035.40s -> 18040.36s]  It's a great game. It's fun. It was fun for a while. It was cool. I don't care anymore. Oh,
[18040.36s -> 18065.45s]  I care about listening to vacuum cleaners. Ready? Two minutes. I need to change this to something
[18065.45s -> 18069.21s]  else. Because if you're looking for hot lava gameplay and you come in here and it's a guy
[18069.21s -> 18074.78s]  listening to a vacuum cleaner, you're going to probably sort of annoyed by that. And I don't
[18074.78s -> 18097.85s]  blame you. I don't. Let's change the title. Where's my shit? There it is. All right. I can keep the
[18097.85s -> 18111.02s]  title at numbers go up. It's been like that the whole time, even with the lava one. Okay. All right.
[18111.18s -> 18121.62s]  Let's do it. Are you ready? So people, just so people can know, I need to put a text on the
[18121.62s -> 18149.75s]  screen just so people know. Cause if you come in here, you need to be curious, right? All right.
[18149.75s -> 18159.96s]  No, what the fuck is, get back here. Okay. I'm ready. I'm going to try. It's going to be loud.
[18159.96s -> 18179.30s]  Just to make sure everyone's aware of that. Both earphones. I'm not going to cheat. Two minutes.
[18179.38s -> 18183.46s]  I see it on the clock. I'm ready. Three, two, one.
[18231.99s -> 18241.42s]  There's two things going on here. Somebody said, dude, use push to talk. You fucking asshole.
[18241.42s -> 18246.38s]  And the second thing is you can, you're going to hear the vacuum cleaner going over a rug.
[18246.38s -> 18258.63s]  It goes like, going back and forth. There you go. I can do it. I've done that so many times now.
[18259.43s -> 18311.98s]  Three, two, one. God damn it. One, two, three, go.
[18394.09s -> 18401.24s]  Fix your mic. I have the gain turned up all the fucking way.
[18406.41s -> 18412.66s]  Hey guys, what's going on? Yeah. Hi guys. Just my microphone can't pick me up. So I
[18412.66s -> 18427.58s]  got to turn the gain all the way up. He's weak to mic. No, it's just like,
[18428.54s -> 18431.58s]  I just imagine somebody fucking needing to turn their mic all the way to,
[18432.78s -> 18457.18s]  how many minutes was that? It was less than two. I don't want to. I never told you they were going
[18457.18s -> 18460.95s]  to be any good. How the hell am I going to do this? Okay. I need something that's,
[18463.59s -> 18466.97s]  I need something else that's on a vacuum cleaner. Cause you guys,
[18466.97s -> 18474.74s]  I need something that you guys can't make jokes about. You know what I mean?
[18474.74s -> 18488.81s]  You guys, you guys are too quick. Microwave sound. I'll try it.
[18488.81s -> 18513.70s]  This just sounds like an airplane. It's, that's the same sound. Fix your fucking mic.
[18514.58s -> 18536.06s]  Ah, that's the best one so far. All right. How about, um, saxophone? Let's see. Okay. Three,
[18536.14s -> 18589.94s]  two, one.
[18605.43s -> 18612.97s]  It's the fucking people in the background. Oh, it's the people that were talking. There was a
[18612.97s -> 18623.08s]  crowd. It was just like street noise. A minute. I don't care if this takes me all night. I'll do
[18623.08s -> 18632.84s]  it. I don't care if it takes me all five. You know what? Fuck it. Three minutes. One, two, three,
[18632.84s -> 18650.12s]  go. That's different. What? Right. Hold on. Three, two, one, go. Three, two, three, two, one,
[18650.12s -> 18654.71s]  three. Three, two, one, go.
[18771.18s -> 18777.67s]  Nothing was funny. It just, this one went on for a long time. This one went on for like a full,
[18777.67s -> 18783.19s]  like 45 seconds. Usually the first three minutes of this video was one, two, here's another saxophone.
[18783.19s -> 18794.79s]  Here's another saxophone. And this guy just keep playing. This guy's just going. I think my brain
[18795.75s -> 18802.79s]  is, there you go. Hey, there you are. I think my brain is too fucked up to do this.
[18807.02s -> 18817.74s]  Every second, there's like something else in here. Give me something else. Something easy. You gotta,
[18817.74s -> 18829.18s]  something easy. The beach. That's actually would work pretty well, I think. I can't see myself
[18829.18s -> 18836.49s]  laughing at the beach. It's the beach. It's just a beach. What's the fun? There's nothing there.
[18836.49s -> 18841.93s]  Just imagine. Can I close my eyes? Is that, can I close my eyes? I can't, right? Like you're not
[18841.93s -> 18847.24s]  going to take that from me. Actually that'll make it worse because then I'll just see images.
[18848.46s -> 18853.74s]  Okay. We're going to go with, you just laughed at a vacuum. I know, but it was a lot more going on.
[18854.46s -> 18858.38s]  There were like four or 500 different onion layers as to why the vacuum was funny.
[18859.98s -> 18868.70s]  Okay. Let's do the beach ambience. Blinking is also emotion. No, it's a necessary
[18868.70s -> 18880.50s]  mechanism to survive. Ocean sounds for sleep. How would you think this was funny? This is not
[18880.50s -> 18894.78s]  at all. Here we go. Beach ambience on tropical paradise. Impossible to think this is funny.
[18899.54s -> 18907.64s]  Three minutes. I'm prepared. It's all out of my system at this point. Three minutes. That's not,
[18907.64s -> 18912.04s]  I've been streaming for fucking five, almost five and a half hours. Three minutes is not a big deal.
[18912.12s -> 18937.67s]  I can do three goddamn minutes, but hold on a second. Okay. I, how are we doing? Fight the boss.
[18937.67s -> 18944.15s]  No, rebirth. Almost there. And in four minutes I get rewarded with, with a hundred million,
[18945.67s -> 18953.34s]  a billion. I'll figure this out later. Okay. That sounds good. Four more minutes and I can
[18953.34s -> 18966.26s]  rebirth again. Just focus on the rebirth and that's it. Okay. This isn't funny. So don't laugh. I know.
[18966.26s -> 18973.46s]  That's what I'm saying. It's, this is just water sounds. Three, two, one, action.
[19008.20s -> 19059.93s]  Started over, started over. So is it bath time? Started over three minutes. Starting now. Go. Now.
[19084.28s -> 19090.20s]  Wait, my mind's allowed to wander. I need like some, I need sound. I need noise. I need something
[19090.20s -> 19095.64s]  talking. I can't fucking do it. I can't do it. I don't think I can. There's your one, your two,
[19095.64s -> 19103.06s]  your three, whatever it is. I don't think I can do it. Do math. I keep thinking of fucking bath now.
[19103.06s -> 19111.37s]  Somebody said bath time with Jeremy. Fuck. Just listen to a Ted talk. Is that like a loud, is that
[19111.37s -> 19120.79s]  loud? Can I listen to a Ted talk? Ted talk like science. I don't know. This is quantum physics,
[19122.10s -> 19161.99s]  quantum physics. When it starts in three, two, a lot about. Have you ever had, so have you ever
[19161.99s -> 19167.51s]  had this experience? Starting now. Having a chat with someone and they're telling you something
[19167.51s -> 19173.82s]  about a subject they're very interested in or they know a lot about and you're following along
[19174.54s -> 19177.82s]  and then at some stage you realize you kind of lost the thread of what they're saying
[19178.78s -> 19182.62s]  and then you're standing there and you realize you've got absolutely no idea what they're talking
[19182.62s -> 19190.31s]  about. I had this recently with a friend who knows a lot about investing. No. And something.
[19190.31s -> 19197.61s]  Because I just saw me in the fucking reflector watching TV this way. Like I'm watching TV on
[19197.61s -> 19207.64s]  stream and the TV's off camera over here. No, it can't be somebody talking. I got it. I know
[19207.64s -> 19230.09s]  it'll, I know what to do. Um, how long is it? Okay. The national anthem is five minutes long.
[19230.09s -> 19247.05s]  Here we go. United States of America national anthem. Um, no, uh, how about, um,
[19247.93s -> 19263.21s]  zoo, uh, I don't know what TV static. No, why would beach? Why would I not be able to do
[19263.21s -> 19273.02s]  beach for fuck's sake? Seagull sounds that actually would be okay. This, this has to be the one.
[19273.02s -> 19277.27s]  If I don't do it here, then I'm turning the stream off. I'm out of here. This is like,
[19277.27s -> 19301.45s]  I've got to go like dunk my head in water. It's plugged in just to make sure everyone sees it.
[19301.45s -> 19746.70s]  It's plugged in. Okay. Starting now. This is the last time I'm ever going to play this game.
[19748.87s -> 19752.55s]  No, I am so Zen. I'm completely Zen. So we need to have a Zen background.
[19753.59s -> 19778.68s]  This is six hours of Zen. No, no, no. Katamari. There we go. It feels pretty good. All right. So
[19778.68s -> 19784.76s]  I need now I have 25 experience points. We're going to do plus one energy speed. There we go.
[19785.48s -> 19795.13s]  Get a couple more of these too. Why not? That's for going very fast. I don't think it's possible
[19795.13s -> 19802.50s]  to fight the boss. Not yet. At least maybe in a few, in a few moments. It's possible.
[19803.14s -> 19815.50s]  Money pit is 26 minutes. We will see that again at least one more time. This guy no longer laughs.
[19816.38s -> 19832.46s]  Let's test it. Let's see if I've actually achieved true focus. Here we go.
[19832.46s -> 19855.45s]  I've achieved it. That would have the, the unascended me would have laughed at that last
[19855.45s -> 19884.22s]  one because it was so abrupt. And now I need screaming. Okay. Let's try. It's not going to do
[19884.22s -> 19896.20s]  anything. That was close. That was very close, but I've ascended. Yeah. That would have, that's what
[19896.68s -> 19915.78s]  it's. All right. Let's just play the game. There's only somebody. Oh, it's still going too fast.
[19916.58s -> 19933.03s]  It was the three. It was the, it was the third, just the same person. All right. That's it. I'm
[19933.03s -> 19951.91s]  ready. I need music though. What the fuck am I doing? Okay. So yeah, let's go back here. I'm
[19951.91s -> 19955.35s]  going to, I'm going to, let's just do it now. I'm not waiting 15 moments for this shit.
[19957.70s -> 19969.37s]  Toughness. What do we got? I can do a bunch into the cube and now that puts it at 13,
[19969.37s -> 19983.48s]  maxed out, combine all this shit. Looking good. Cube, all the cubes just put them together.
[19987.11s -> 19994.22s]  Special, right? Wait a minute. You, what did that say? That said something.
[19995.02s -> 20014.14s]  Dragon. What did that say? It said, that said a new cube. Infinity cube. You should probably
[20014.14s -> 20029.54s]  boost your equipment first before boosting the cube. What should I eat? You guys have any ideas
[20029.54s -> 20048.52s]  what I should have for food? I need some good food ideas. Chicken sandwich. Maybe. All right.
[20048.52s -> 20059.62s]  Let's, let's ascend. This is going to be a big, big fucking deal. 450 million. Get a poke bowl.
[20060.34s -> 20069.13s]  I'm actually not a big fan of raw tuna. Not really. It's, it's all right. I'd rather have it
[20069.13s -> 20085.03s]  as a spicy tuna roll. A poke bowl. But I like spicy tuna, but I don't like it. I don't, you
[20085.03s -> 20092.46s]  don't get the big red fatty tuna like sushi. Try to just wait the, no. Rebirth. Let's do it.
[20096.78s -> 20103.48s]  This is now going to be ridiculous. Like absolutely ridiculous. Microism cereal.
[20104.12s -> 20113.30s]  You're trying to gross me out. Okay. Rebirth. 450 million. Now we can, I, I could nuke.
[20113.30s -> 20121.94s]  I don't have any, I don't have any points. Let's do just, why is that taking so long?
[20123.48s -> 20132.73s]  All right. Okay. We're already at eight trillion attack. Just in case anyone was curious. Boom,
[20132.73s -> 20139.18s]  boom, boom, boom, boom. I don't want to nuke. I like to see how far we go. So we're at 20 trillion
[20139.18s -> 20147.64s]  attack. He's got 120. We've got plenty. Just drain them down. I've got an image to look at.
[20148.28s -> 20160.09s]  I'll never look at that one again. Thank you though. Uh, adventure. I'm, I'm going to get
[20160.09s -> 20168.46s]  very close to being able to do this shit. What else has special? This does. I got the money
[20168.46s -> 20181.86s]  pitback fight boss. Uh, cap is going up. Oh yeah. You got, you guys got full of, this is what this,
[20181.86s -> 20189.06s]  you guys are full of photos. So tomorrow, we're not done yet, but tomorrow I am going to,
[20193.53s -> 20200.34s]  what the fuck? It's just the idol face. German idol. Uh, tomorrow is possible that it'll be
[20200.34s -> 20205.30s]  the community night. You'll find out very soon. Uh, tomorrow I'll be here tomorrow morning,
[20205.30s -> 20210.26s]  early kind of afternoonish, early morningish, uh, to tell you what, if there's enough,
[20210.98s -> 20213.46s]  if there's enough, we're going to do the community night. And what is the community night? The
[20213.46s -> 20222.41s]  community night is the new monthly or bi-monthly stream where we hang out for a few hours and we
[20222.41s -> 20226.33s]  go over a bunch of community artwork, a bunch of community videos, a bunch of anything. That's
[20226.33s -> 20231.05s]  just original community content. It doesn't just have to be art. It's not necessarily an artwork
[20231.05s -> 20238.60s]  showcase. It's an everything showcase and we just chill. And maybe I'll do a coloring book.
[20239.16s -> 20254.25s]  Maybe I'll do a coloring book on stream. What is cracked? Oh, movie night. Yeah, kind of is.
[20254.25s -> 20276.26s]  It's kind of a movie night. If there was a police officer that wanted to guaranteed write like
[20277.59s -> 20281.59s]  50 tickets a day, guarantee, and we're talking absolute guarantee.
[20282.89s -> 20300.78s]  Hang out over there. Oh, I need music. What else we got? I'm just going to go next, next,
[20300.78s -> 20306.70s]  next on Lego Island until there's something else. Next, next, next, next, next, next, next.
[20307.42s -> 20318.28s]  Okay. This is, I guess another, this is also Lego related, which is called the catchy song.
[20345.45s -> 20354.94s]  No, no, no. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I call bullshit on that one because here's the original.
[20362.42s -> 20371.74s]  And yes, it goes on and on my friend. Some people started singing it, not knowing why
[20371.74s -> 20381.54s]  did you sing that instantly? Don't wait. Don't you come over here and she's like, oh, stop this
[20381.54s -> 20388.26s]  nonsense. That's enough. I got off with that song, please. No more. No more of this song.
[20389.22s -> 20393.30s]  Nothing in here. Let's prove it. There ain't fucking anything in here.
[20395.96s -> 20404.62s]  Turn off that song. Some people started singing it, not knowing what it was,
[20404.62s -> 20413.50s]  but we'll continue singing it forever. Just because the song that doesn't end the fuck out
[20413.50s -> 20434.14s]  of here with I'm done with that. This is a great cup though. I will say, you know, people do like,
[20434.14s -> 20437.82s]  oh, I'm going to watch this video for an hour or the 10 hour version or whatever. You've never
[20437.82s -> 20443.64s]  seen anybody watch that one. Maybe you have. Is that like a subset of YouTube or Twitch or
[20443.64s -> 20452.49s]  something that I don't know about? All right. I got a lot of, let's do this. Gorgonzola. Wait a
[20452.49s -> 20459.35s]  minute. This is 18. I just, I did it. I got to, I cut to 18. Augmentation feature unlock. Go check
[20459.35s -> 20463.99s]  it out on the features. A new adventure zone has also been unlocked. The forest, exhausted, bruised,
[20463.99s -> 20468.63s]  and slightly deaf from explosion. You hobble into this mysterious hut. And indeed this seems
[20468.63s -> 20474.60s]  to be the home of the wizard, whoever he is. You see the stereotypical bubbling cauldron,
[20474.60s -> 20478.92s]  various gross magical ingredients, and oddly enough, dozens of empty cans of compressed air
[20478.92s -> 20493.88s]  laying on the floor. Like, wait, why? Uh, okay. However, the bug-eyed wizard has caught your
[20493.88s -> 20500.06s]  attention as he whoops maniacally, greeting you like an old friend. With your memory lost,
[20500.06s -> 20506.46s]  you just take him at his word that you knew each other. Okay. He claims he can help you if you had,
[20506.46s -> 20511.26s]  if you'd head through what he calls the hazy cave just behind his home and gather some of
[20511.26s -> 20517.42s]  that good stuff. Whatever that is. Feeling unusually merciful, you agree to help and set off
[20517.42s -> 20522.54s]  into the cave. Be prepared for anything that in the cave there, fella. The weird gases in there
[20522.54s -> 20527.21s]  make you go a little loopy. And if you need a little something something to get stronger,
[20527.21s -> 20531.37s]  see Mr. Jensen. Just a couple of houses down, he'll hook you up with some of what he calls
[20531.37s -> 20536.33s]  augmentations. It's weird sci-fi mumbo jumbo, but I can't deny that it works.
[20537.05s -> 20551.43s]  Augmentation. Unlock by defeating Gorgon. Next augment, so this is a gold sink. Base stat multiplier
[20551.43s -> 20577.50s]  one. Wait, energy alo- energy allocated? What? Really? Let's get that up. Well, that's only
[20577.50s -> 20584.87s]  halfway there. You use energy to build it up and it adds a multiplier. That's cool. This is a fun
[20584.87s -> 20598.60s]  game. Let's pull this down now. Okay, I gotta do increments of like 200 now or 100 at least.
[20604.92s -> 20611.26s]  Alright, we're at 3000. What's my actual cap now? 3757. That's pretty good. That doubles attack and
[20611.26s -> 20616.95s]  defense. I have, speaking of attack and defense, quadrillion. Almost nine- eight quadrillion.
[20617.59s -> 20623.35s]  So I can do damage. I'm about to kill Gorgonzola right now and I'm going to get the artifact.
[20623.99s -> 20631.19s]  You're having more fun with this this clicking game than with the lava game. I feel like we're
[20631.19s -> 20636.94s]  kind of past the point of no return with this one. And I mean, I'm only going to be streaming
[20637.58s -> 20645.19s]  I don't know. I did it. Yes, you're fighting sentient cheeses now. Yes, it's probably the gas.
[20645.19s -> 20649.93s]  No, you should not let this cheese or anything else in this cave live. This one is armed with
[20649.93s -> 20656.95s]  a massive crossbow. How is it even able to fire the damn thing? I don't know. But I just got
[20657.75s -> 20671.13s]  safety scissors. Time left to complete the augment. Oh, I get it. 11 minutes.
[20673.72s -> 20679.66s]  Shit. Okay. Um, I have to build them. Let's go into the sewers though, because I-
[20683.94s -> 20688.55s]  Uh, I don't want to listen to that, but that's fine. I need gold. I need gold. I need gold.
[20688.55s -> 20690.87s]  Why am I not getting gold? Because I'm not doing adventuring. That's why.
[20691.67s -> 20703.02s]  That's what's going on here. This is an ad or is this the actual- no, this is the actual thing.
[20703.02s -> 20710.70s]  Okay. So let's go to adventure. I'm in the forest. These things are way too powerful. I don't think
[20710.70s -> 20719.94s]  I can do the forest. This is going to be tricky. I might get something good for this though. Let's
[20719.94s -> 20728.23s]  see. 3900 gold. You've defeated a goblin. 3344. I mean, I'm- I need more max HP. Bad.
[20734.18s -> 20743.48s]  Fairy has defeated you. Right. How am I doing on this fight? 11 and 13. Not really enough.
[20744.12s -> 20756.82s]  Let's go all the way. Cap that shit up. All right. 10k levels in previous attack,
[20756.82s -> 20760.52s]  which is not going to happen anytime soon. I'm just going to put it into here.
[20760.84s -> 20773.66s]  What's the point? All right. Looks good. So 11. I need 10,000 gold, which I almost have.
[20773.66s -> 20784.87s]  Adventure. Let's try it again. Forest. Good. This should be easy. A lot of HP though. Orc.
[20785.59s -> 20803.02s]  Is that a Mario Yahtzee in the background? Orc dropped a toughness boost 2 and 4300 gold.
[20804.87s -> 20822.01s]  Toughness boost- wait. Is it working? Didn't I have money? I thought- Z. Bonus 2 bonus.
[20822.65s -> 20833.94s]  Oh shit. Okay. Axel. Toughness. None of these needed. Toughness 2. Here we go. In the boots.
[20835.74s -> 20838.94s]  Advancing back to the adventure. Did I die? No, I'm good. I need 10 grand.
[20839.74s -> 20859.99s]  10 grand. Here we go. Augmentation. 10,000 gold. Time left to complete. 10 minutes.
[20860.79s -> 20866.38s]  Let's get some- no. Let's make that easier. I don't want to wait around 10 minutes. Are you
[20866.38s -> 20882.62s]  kidding me? 3 minutes. All right. 39 quadrillion. Uh oh. I don't really have enough.
[20883.58s -> 20889.75s]  What do I get for rebirth? This is going up like crazy. All right. At 15 minutes this is
[20889.75s -> 20899.66s]  going to be insane. Get milk infusion. Base stat multiplier 25. Marinating your bones in
[20899.66s -> 20915.37s]  milk for 6 hours should toughen them up. 200,000 gold. Is that 22 hours or 22 minutes? 22 minutes.
[20915.37s -> 20923.06s]  Good. Okay. Experience. I'm going to wait for- I want to do this at- I'll do it right now.
[20926.90s -> 20936.31s]  No money pit. Not worth it. 22 minutes if you use all of your energy. Okay.
[20937.43s -> 20945.43s]  Jerma, stop- you need to stop playing this game. Only tonight? And maybe leave my computer on
[20945.43s -> 20953.19s]  overnight and just play this and just not stream it but try to get to the vacation.
[20953.91s -> 20971.85s]  Jerma, please. Please, Jerma, please. We'll- you'll fine. We're fine. Inventory. All right.
[20979.75s -> 20990.12s]  Can I combine this? No. That's 20 attack power. So this thing is junk now. Get rid of it.
[20990.76s -> 21001.48s]  It's a wooden sword. This is junk too. Get rid of this too. I'm never going to put this on. All
[21001.48s -> 21006.12s]  right. Now I can do adventure. Let's see. Forest. I should be doing much more damage
[21006.12s -> 21024.18s]  now. It's funny because Link doesn't talk. RIP 100 set bonus. What do you mean 100 set bonus?
[21024.82s -> 21036.86s]  3800 gold. What about my augmentation? Almost there. 41 seconds. This stream is the longest
[21036.86s -> 21050.46s]  worst joke of 2019. This is- this is not a joke to me. This is- this is a game I'm playing.
[21053.34s -> 21063.53s]  This is my- I want to play this game. Not everything's gotta be a joke. You understand?
[21065.54s -> 21071.85s]  Here. Just take that last bit. Just take that last little bit. Sip it. Come on. Get it. Nice.
[21072.49s -> 21084.68s]  Wow, you got it. Nice work. Why am I doing that? I didn't spill it. There's no- I don't got anything.
[21084.68s -> 21095.86s]  I got a safety scissor. Sick. So my stats- 43 go- oh, at least shit. Hold on. Well, all right.
[21095.86s -> 21104.31s]  Well, now you die. You put creamer in your coffee. It depends on what kind of coffee it is. Ice coffee
[21104.31s -> 21117.85s]  I do usually do almond milk. All right, I got the brie. This cheese is named after a city in the
[21117.85s -> 21123.85s]  Netherlands. Knowing that, this is going to be a tough fight. 1.9 quintillion. Quintillion.
[21125.16s -> 21131.66s]  It's- yeah, it's absolutely double the stats. That's fucking pretty good. How am I doing in
[21131.66s -> 21139.32s]  adventure mode? What do we got? Anything else? Just a one? Put it in here. 51 power now.
[21142.44s -> 21151.66s]  Sextillion incoming. Yeah. I got 2.6 billion. I have to rebirth again right now. I have to.
[21151.66s -> 21157.42s]  Like, why would I not? And then when we- when we- then- and then the stream ends.
[21158.06s -> 21165.05s]  I think so. That sounds like a plan to me. Sextillion. Yeah, sextillion. It's- you don't
[21165.05s -> 21182.81s]  know what sextillion? Here comes the end of the stream voice. Uh oh. What is my issue? Do I have
[21182.81s -> 21196.39s]  one? Do I have an issue? I don't think I do. Do I have one? Tell me if I do. So I can get- I'm
[21196.39s -> 21204.63s]  getting more of these. 20,000 gold. Holy- that's insane. I can do this again? Milk infusion. That's
[21204.63s -> 21211.00s]  20 minutes. I'm gonna rebirth. I don't know if I keep that though. Do I- I don't think I keep this.
[21211.90s -> 21223.88s]  No, this ain't gonna happen. 100 quadrillion? No. No way. Would I tell you guys if I shit myself
[21223.88s -> 21229.00s]  on stream? Yeah, because I would have to leave. I would be like, guys, I have to leave. I have- I
[21229.00s -> 21233.08s]  have had a small accident, is what I would say. I'd say I had a little accident. And then I would
[21233.08s -> 21237.90s]  leave. I would just leave. I'm not gonna sit here. But that's never gonna happen. But yes, I would.
[21237.90s -> 21242.38s]  I would tell you guys that there was an accident on- like, I had a small accident and I have to go.
[21243.10s -> 21271.56s]  That's all there is to it. So, um, I have to leave very soon here. What am I gonna eat for food?
[21272.44s -> 21282.97s]  You guys have to help me decide this. Let's go back to the forest. We have to break it down first.
[21283.69s -> 21290.68s]  There is- let's go over some genres. I want genre first. Buffalo chicken wings. That- you know what?
[21290.68s -> 21300.95s]  I think you just nailed it. You nailed it. You did. Yeah, you nailed it. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the
[21300.95s -> 21310.17s]  help. Oh, I know exactly where I'm gonna get them from too. Hash house or go-go? From the Link. I
[21310.17s -> 21327.40s]  wonder if they even have them. Special boost 1. Stylish. Ooh. Skeleton. 51. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21327.40s -> 21335.82s]  Rebirth. 3 billion. All right, it's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. I have to do it.
[21337.46s -> 21341.67s]  Doing this one more time and then I'm gonna go get food. And then I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[21345.99s -> 21363.19s]  Yeah, I will. He'll see me tomorrow. He shit himself. We're not gonna see you again. I'm
[21363.19s -> 21366.63s]  gonna stream tomorrow. I'm gonna stream tomorrow at like 1 o'clock Pacific.
[21367.59s -> 21381.00s]  All right, experience. Let's do- no. Here comes a rebirth. I got it. 6.5 billion.
[21381.72s -> 21392.26s]  Do it. Bang. This is where it gets wild. They're- hold on a minute. Max energy on this rebirth is
[21392.26s -> 21412.01s]  capped at 3900. On re- okay. All right, nice. Hold on. Trillion already? Already 7- 100 trillion.
[21414.30s -> 21423.05s]  Let's see. I haven't done a nuke all day. Nuke. Down at the fast zombie. Nuke. I can't. He killed
[21423.05s -> 21441.10s]  me. You motherfucker. You killed me. Yeah, it's time to eat food soon. Food isn't coming. I'm
[21441.10s -> 21447.64s]  gonna be- no. He killed me again. All right, so we're doing all right. You know, I'll tell you
[21447.64s -> 21454.01s]  something. I had a blast on today's stream. I had a fucking great time. This was a lot of fun.
[21454.65s -> 21465.59s]  Sometimes it don't matter what the game is. We make our own damn fun. I'm glad somebody did.
[21467.29s -> 21485.22s]  Easy. Easy. Easy. I'm admitting this is a bad stream. What? What are you talking about? This
[21485.22s -> 21489.30s]  is like the- I had- I've had like the- I had- I played Hitman yesterday and had a different kind
[21489.30s -> 21499.83s]  of fun. I had a lot of fun today. What are you talking about? It's got a pants blast.
[21500.79s -> 21515.22s]  It is a fucking mess, so I've gotta go. I've never heard that term before. It's a pants blast.
[21516.02s -> 21540.60s]  You guys are sick. Look at that. It's like lightning. Oh, already a quadrillion. Skip it.
[21541.08s -> 21547.16s]  Skip it. Skip it. No, not this one. All right, augmentation. I lost my augmentation though.
[21556.76s -> 21566.68s]  Yeah, this does hurt my eyes. I need full HP. Yeah, I also need to do this too. I need this
[21566.68s -> 21576.09s]  to get this. I need defense. Uh, adventuring is also important right now too. What do I- inventory?
[21576.09s -> 21582.73s]  Nothing? What is- 10, 10. No, there's no reason for me to- just get rid of this. I don't need to-
[21582.73s -> 21604.52s]  why do I need to hold on to this? There's a dark mode? Holy shit. You need to buy the ascended
[21604.52s -> 21615.19s]  newbie pack in the sellout shop to turn this on. Oh, that's great. I said that four hours ago. It
[21615.19s -> 21621.11s]  wasn't- it wasn't nighttime four hours ago. It was three o'clock pacific time. The sun is still
[21621.11s -> 21636.68s]  shining. I don't need dark mode then. It's later now. All right, now I can do this. It's 20,000
[21636.68s -> 21645.99s]  gold. I need more gold. How's adventuring doing? But we're gone, boss. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it.
[21645.99s -> 21660.54s]  Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Nice. Did it. They beat level 37. Oh my god,
[21660.54s -> 21667.96s]  that ain't gonna happen. Almost there, almost at 10,000. And then I'm just gonna spam- I'm gonna
[21667.96s -> 21673.90s]  take all the points away from the training. Let's- let's actually start doing this now. I'm gonna
[21673.90s -> 21680.33s]  dump every single point into the augmentation. Every single one. It's 20,000 gold, right?

[21712.94s -> 21716.22s]  do if I do this I can actually fight but I can't because I don't have the thing

[21934.94s -> 21954.82s]  come on I'm saying this bump too bad this Sonic game sucked that Sonic game
[21954.82s -> 21959.86s]  sucked there hasn't been a good Sonic the Hedgehog game in probably about 12
[21959.86s -> 21976.87s]  years but uh hold on people saying Sonic mania but Sonic mania is just a
[21976.87s -> 21981.69s]  compilation of all the other good ones Sonic mania Sonic mania they just like
[21981.69s -> 21984.25s]  did they said hey this is I have Sonic the Hedgehog one two and three are great
[21984.25s -> 21988.26s]  let's like kind of make that again and redo them all I mean no it's not is my
[21988.26s -> 21995.62s]  gut that do I have that wrong what's the one where they just remade the first
[21995.62s -> 22006.32s]  like three games and call it something else they never did that just wait
[22006.32s -> 22018.29s]  generations there it is there okay I was wrong Sonic mania it's just this is just
[22018.29s -> 22029.46s]  Sonic the Hedgehog they just remade it how's it what is the same game is this a
[22029.46s -> 22038.09s]  remake of like the first one generations is that game it is this has new levels
[22038.09s -> 22046.11s]  so it's a new game with the old palette okay all right okay all right I was
[22046.11s -> 22051.92s]  wrong that's fine I was wrong I was thinking of generations okay when they
[22051.92s -> 22060.29s]  come out 2016 all right okay all right okay yep okay I'm corrected that's fine
[22060.29s -> 22077.82s]  okay I got two of these now good that's all I want all right boss time basic
[22077.82s -> 22085.50s]  training let's get it in there tap it wait is it they get you don't even
[22085.50s -> 22100.00s]  flashing anymore they should make another classic Sonic game I don't know
[22100.00s -> 22109.47s]  what they should do with Sonic cuz it Sonic soda has like an unfair unfair
[22109.47s -> 22113.95s]  weight put on them I think for some reason and I'll give you an example well
[22113.95s -> 22120.50s]  now it's it's so Mario when they make a Mario game it's still like Super Mario
[22120.50s -> 22125.44s]  it's still you know like a plug most of them almost all of my platforms right so
[22125.44s -> 22130.68s]  if you make a Mario game you make six seven eight nine ten Mario games I'm
[22130.72s -> 22134.72s]  talking the last ten years that are essentially jump from spot to spot right
[22134.72s -> 22140.16s]  Sonic the Hedgehog is just I go very fast but I go very fast has not stood
[22140.16s -> 22147.80s]  the test of time that jump from spot to spot has so what the what that's kind of
[22147.80s -> 22160.57s]  how do you go really fast in 2020 you kind of can and let's just racing game
[22160.57s -> 22168.87s]  they could have taken Sonic and made it is its own it's like Mario Kart type
[22168.91s -> 22174.60s]  game I know they did they did Sonic races but I'm talking like completely
[22174.60s -> 22181.65s]  transitioned the whole entire character into this is a racing game not like oh
[22181.65s -> 22187.39s]  let's go back and do Sonic unleashed Sonic colors Sonic we go fast this way
[22187.39s -> 22191.89s]  no just have it be your race it's a race have to be like that don't touch the
[22191.89s -> 22195.25s]  floor lava game except it's it's Sonic the Hedgehog and you got to move fast
[22195.25s -> 22202.12s]  and bunny hop and put it on PC and stuff I don't know I do I remember colors
[22202.12s -> 22208.05s]  wasn't really not that bad though because Mario has a bunch of these
[22208.05s -> 22216.29s]  gimmicks right but they work gravity big gimmick right Mario Galaxy this you jump
[22216.29s -> 22219.85s]  from the planets you run around a circle is like a gravity okay that's cool that
[22219.85s -> 22223.21s]  worked because you jump around and gravity works when you jump you land
[22223.21s -> 22228.12s]  back on the ground in Sonic unleashed their Mario Galaxy type scenario was
[22228.12s -> 22234.28s]  turn into a werewolf that doesn't make doesn't that does not add anything to
[22234.28s -> 22241.93s]  going fast in fact werewolf a werewolf is slow they're not that fast if you've
[22241.93s -> 22245.17s]  seen Twilight the vampires run much faster than the werewolves because they
[22245.17s -> 22251.38s]  have like the super duper lightning like super speed so and then didn't they
[22251.38s -> 22254.58s]  they did a they did like he did it but they gave him like a sword and a shield
[22254.58s -> 22261.25s]  in one of them he had like a fucking he was like a knight right that that does
[22261.25s -> 22269.26s]  not make going fast more interesting Mario um Mario Galaxy right Mario
[22269.34s -> 22274.38s]  Odyssey Mario Odyssey they gave him this hat the gimmick you could throw the hat
[22274.38s -> 22278.90s]  on stuff and control it and it was interesting and it added way more
[22278.90s -> 22284.52s]  dynamic to jumping up and down on stuff they should have just given Sonic a
[22284.52s -> 22290.27s]  fucking car just give him a car and just make a taxi game or something I don't
[22290.27s -> 22296.74s]  know they did but I mean I mean in every game like you know once when Mario gets
[22296.74s -> 22300.62s]  a picks up the the fire plant and you can shoot fire out of his hands and
[22300.62s -> 22303.18s]  that's the gimmick have to be a thing that you pick up and it's Sonic goes in
[22303.18s -> 22306.14s]  the car and it's a super cool like Batmobile type car and it goes like 500
[22306.14s -> 22312.20s]  miles per hour and you bet you do the level in the car anything that goes
[22312.20s -> 22315.40s]  really fast like train have him like turn to a train or have him get in the
[22315.40s -> 22318.36s]  train and go really fast and train have him getting like you know he can fly
[22318.36s -> 22323.43s]  turns into a helicopter I don't know what things go really fucking fast you don't
[22323.43s -> 22359.88s]  slow him down you make him go faster that sounds awful but still Mario has
[22359.88s -> 22366.40s]  gimmicks that quantum that they they add to him jumping up and down Sonic
[22366.40s -> 22372.30s]  keeps taking things away from how fast he goes have a time travel have a Sonic
[22372.30s -> 22375.34s]  the fucking hedgehog time travel game where he goes too fast in the beginning
[22375.34s -> 22378.58s]  the opening cutscene he goes way too fast and he goes like 200 years in the
[22378.58s -> 22391.65s]  future or something they did that oh well I'm gonna go so fast it goes back
[22391.65s -> 22397.34s]  in time if they had to go back in time oh they've done all options then you
[22397.34s -> 22401.42s]  time travel going fast or that's pretty much the only gimmick you can do okay
[22401.42s -> 22404.42s]  they did it with how it was again hum what was it rated
[22404.42s -> 22416.30s]  Sonic CD generations and CD or I got a better idea Sega make another super
[22416.30s -> 22423.59s]  monkey ball game and add Sonic as a fucking collectible character he moves
[22423.59s -> 22427.71s]  fast in that thing they are okay they're doing that too they're on the right
[22427.71s -> 22432.63s]  track they're on the right track good here's Sonic and the Black Knight exactly
[22432.63s -> 22443.48s]  we were just talking about this is called Night of the Wind not bad all
[22443.48s -> 22453.06s]  right blue cheese did you know that this stuff has mold in it gross I love blue
[22453.06s -> 22457.86s]  cheese and I'm gonna have a shitload of it in like 20 minutes all right what I
[22457.86s -> 22463.54s]  need to whatever got capped out here 39 9 augmentation what do I need for milk
[22463.54s -> 22470.80s]  let's make some milk I need 200,000 gold back to adventure mode
[22471.00s -> 22477.33s]  buffalo wings and blue cheese oh yeah you have no idea I'm gonna eat too many
[22477.33s -> 22480.73s]  of those tonight I'm gonna have so many it's gonna be ridiculous texting me
[22480.73s -> 22496.93s]  whoo energy yeah I'm gonna have the whole outfit on forest helmet power so
[22496.93s -> 22503.90s]  this is all right these are not trash toughness 47 let's take a look adventure
[22503.90s -> 22515.07s]  you make me hungry I'm making myself hungry what if Sonic went to the
[22515.07s -> 22525.15s]  Olympics yes that would be interesting wouldn't it or what if they just took
[22525.15s -> 22530.88s]  away the whole Sonic goes really fast because that you always have to worry
[22530.88s -> 22534.28s]  about the fact that at some point during the game when you're walking around
[22534.28s -> 22539.44s]  you're gonna just start going 500 miles per hour what if he gets cursed at the
[22539.44s -> 22542.80s]  beginning of one of the games by dr. Robotnik throws like a curse at him and
[22542.80s -> 22546.32s]  he's oh I can't run fast anymore and now you just have to play a different game
[22546.36s -> 22554.02s]  they that's what they did that's they did that already why is Sonic the
[22554.02s -> 22566.20s]  Simpsons have they done everything they tried everything those games they've
[22566.20s -> 22580.16s]  already made well give him a fucking TV show in a CG movie that's the final step
[22580.16s -> 22584.20s]  there no way getting more games just turn it into a cartoon network show I
[22584.20s -> 22589.76s]  know about them yes the movie yes I know the movie I know about the movie that's
[22589.76s -> 22597.45s]  why I said the movie and no the TV show yes the tip that I know that shit yes I
[22597.57s -> 22602.55s]  know that's the end that's the end game that's how you ended and then that's
[22602.55s -> 22607.40s]  gonna run for like fucking 35 seasons and then Sega is gonna they went from
[22607.40s -> 22613.52s]  making hardware consoles to we don't make consoles anymore to now we make
[22613.52s -> 22617.08s]  games only but now we don't make games anymore now we just make TV shows and
[22617.08s -> 22638.21s]  they're gonna just bake cartoons in 20 years Sonic Souls born might be
[22638.21s -> 22645.25s]  interesting you've moved really fast that might be their plan
[22645.49s -> 22658.80s]  but Sega does have a lot of great properties though what Sega's number
[22658.80s -> 22674.41s]  besides Sonic Sega has House of the Dead Sonic Yakuza okay what what else but I'm
[22674.41s -> 22677.29s]  talking like relevant series that have like they've had of something to come

[22880.23s -> 22888.06s]  phone this is this is literally in the recommended right here this is like that
[22888.06s -> 22898.50s]  on the playlist is this cuz I've listened to this bond stream and it's
[22898.50s -> 22910.04s]  cuz I've listened to this on stream I just sound like shit crossword puzzles
[22910.04s -> 22915.12s]  of the new hotness yeah they probably are I can see that all right augmentation
[22915.12s -> 22927.07s]  I want this milk thing how long is it gonna take 16 minutes and 200,000 gold oh
[22927.07s -> 22936.00s]  shit I gotta be I gotta be like the 16 moments this is not ace combat but I
[22936.00s -> 22939.86s]  wish it was have any video games released in the last like week or two
[22939.86s -> 22949.24s]  that have been worth playing I have code vain people but people keep telling me
[22949.24s -> 22963.78s]  that that's not very good we have to figure that out on our own code vain is
[22963.78s -> 22971.96s]  so bad really planet Zoo yeah planets isn't beta though it's that that I want
[22971.96s -> 22979.81s]  to play when it's actually out and release completely oh this is good this
[22979.81s -> 22989.94s]  is a new eight oh yeah put it on oh I'm sorry I've been quiet this is the best
[22989.94s -> 23020.33s]  part play Uno I don't even know how now that's it that's all the only thing I'm
[23020.33s -> 23024.63s]  really wanted to hear in this song the song is seven minutes long but only
[23024.63s -> 23028.88s]  that's like that that's like the 12 seconds that I like if I've heard this
[23028.88s -> 23032.84s]  I've played this song off straight before and sat and watched you know if
[23032.84s -> 23036.52s]  you go into YouTube analytics you can see there's a line that shows you when
[23036.52s -> 23039.92s]  people watched in rewind and it'll show you that the time that what that had the
[23039.92s -> 23046.20s]  most retention I alone have probably made that bar like 60% higher on this
[23046.20s -> 23050.20s]  video because I've rewound this probably I did this spot right there like
[23050.20s -> 23077.29s]  probably two to three thousand times okay I need 200k two to three thousand
[23077.29s -> 23082.47s]  probably because I think about it if I do it what you didn't you know if you
[23082.47s -> 23086.51s]  guys don't realize when you listen to a song and not just with this song but any
[23086.51s -> 23090.75s]  song that you actually like you would be surprised if you were being tracked
[23090.75s -> 23097.12s]  without you knowing like you just bugged yourself essentially right you'd be
[23097.12s -> 23101.20s]  surprised at how many times you actually go back and listen to the same thing over
[23101.20s -> 23104.20s]  and over again oh yeah I heard that I listened to that for a little while you
[23104.20s -> 23115.08s]  look over it's been 27 minutes and you've been on like the same song or
[23115.08s -> 23119.94s]  did I just admit to you that I'm a psychopath I'm not sure which one of
[23119.94s -> 23145.99s]  those things is it is I don't know both just kidding all right augmentation I
[23145.99s -> 23153.84s]  almost have it 16 minutes I need 200,000 gold almost there and then I'm gonna do
[23153.84s -> 23156.74s]  something for 16 minutes before the stream ends that's the final thing I'm
[23156.74s -> 23167.00s]  doing 48 billion pretty good this is gonna double here in a second no good
[23167.00s -> 23176.30s]  games until the Outer Worlds comes out yeah I mean I what there are no there
[23176.30s -> 23187.26s]  like what games have released what about greed fall no I thought about green fault
[23187.26s -> 23191.06s]  from with green fall is just it's gonna be one of those scenarios it's gonna
[23191.06s -> 23198.82s]  bore the hell out of me I know it is I was thinking about it but I just see
[23198.82s -> 23204.38s]  myself sitting there for a couple hours and then I just don't want to pick all
[23204.38s -> 23209.46s]  the dialogue options it kind of looks like it's a Mass Effect II where you got
[23209.46s -> 23214.10s]  like five minutes of combat and exploration and gameplay and then like
[23214.10s -> 23229.42s]  30 minutes of story and go talk to all the people in town is that accurate yes
[23229.42s -> 23234.10s]  okay yeah it's just not I know a lot of people like that stuff and that's fine
[23234.10s -> 23239.42s]  that's that's cool I'm not gonna tell you that that's not a good game it's just
[23239.42s -> 23247.27s]  not usually what I find to be very interesting I don't do well not I'm not
[23247.27s -> 23249.99s]  even talking on stream like oh no let's do it off stream but do you even off
[23249.99s -> 23257.75s]  stream right it doesn't click with me really at all you should play dicey
[23257.75s -> 23264.33s]  dungeons I've heard that was very good you would not like earthbound well
[23264.33s -> 23268.77s]  earthbound is different because earthbound is that's a that's like an
[23268.77s -> 23274.93s]  RPG it's like a turn-based RPG and there's a lot of stuff going on in
[23274.93s -> 23281.68s]  earthbound it's not really the same genre even bookworm adventures deluxe
[23281.68s -> 23288.81s]  how many there's a lot I haven't heard that in a long time maybe I'll do that
[23288.81s -> 23291.41s]  tomorrow that's a lie by the way that's a
[23291.41s -> 23296.41s]  confirmed 23 and a half hours from now lie all right 15 minutes and I get this

[24805.70s -> 24812.41s]  giving bits and I saw that twitch had an option to pay with cash huh when you pay
[24812.41s -> 24816.85s]  okay I decided to try it out and drove to my local CVS needless to say the old
[24816.85s -> 24819.33s]  lady behind the counter was very confused when I told her I was paying
[24819.33s -> 24823.49s]  for an online service very strange experience anyways just thought I'd
[24823.49s -> 24840.66s]  share thanks again what hope your drive went very well this is like this two
[24840.66s -> 24847.34s]  different stories on this there's I had a long drive and I tried to pay for this
[24847.34s -> 24856.95s]  in CVS but thank you for the thousand bits ten bucks and hope you had a good
[24856.95s -> 24864.40s]  drive frilly d frilly d thanks for the five thousand bits from earlier why is
[24864.40s -> 24874.28s]  this guy so serious about vacuuming why the CVS proceeds so long yes why even
[24874.32s -> 24881.04s]  prints why even print receipts anymore what's the point all a receipt does in
[24881.04s -> 24886.56s]  2020 is get crumpled up into an annoying bulky thing in your pocket that you then
[24886.56s -> 24890.60s]  have to avoid when you're trying to get other shit out of your pocket that you
[24890.60s -> 24903.08s]  are actually looking for I can understand taxes for business expenses
[24903.08s -> 24909.16s]  right for tax purposes but why do I need a fucking ten foot long receipt when I
[24910.16s -> 24936.43s]  vitamin water not just for me it's for the coupons coupons it's an alibi you're
[24936.43s -> 24945.18s]  being accused of murder you killed two people you're a serial killer well I
[24945.18s -> 24950.94s]  have the CVS receipt that said I bought a vitamin water at fucking 2 52 p.m.
[24950.94s -> 24959.82s]  exonerated no you can just deep-fake that and just print out your own fake
[24959.86s -> 24962.74s]  receipt no that doesn't work anymore nothing works anymore nothing is real
[24962.74s -> 24966.86s]  anymore you can fake everything now you can print out your own receipt with your
[24966.86s -> 24970.10s]  own with the same receipt paper you buy it on fucking Amazon go to amazon.com
[24970.10s -> 24976.21s]  and type in receipt paper and then go to amazon.com and type in receipt printer
[24976.21s -> 24982.08s]  and then go to the web browser in your web browser and type in receipt maker
[24982.08s -> 24987.08s]  software and go make yourself a fake fucking receipt nothing is real anymore
[24987.24s -> 25014.78s]  seriously that sounds hard I'll just go to jail for 20 years oh fuck oh I'm
[25014.78s -> 25026.13s]  getting an ultrasound on my abdomen by the way now when I laugh really hard or
[25026.13s -> 25033.54s]  cough or like make any sudden movements inside of my right side it hurts yeah
[25033.54s -> 25042.88s]  congratulations the baby in here at least I'll get Disney World but thank
[25042.92s -> 25047.64s]  you for letting thank you Vilemi for the 5,000 bits is to back-to-back 5,000 bit

[25056.14s -> 25063.03s]  5,000 bits thank you excellent excellent excellent excellent smelly
[25063.03s -> 25067.23s]  boy thanks for the 250 bits as Sonic as a character has lost a lot of his appeal
[25067.23s -> 25071.35s]  because his personality itself is dated Mario is basically a blank slate
[25071.35s -> 25075.75s]  character while Sonic has all the baggage of the mid to late 90s holy shit
[25075.75s -> 25089.45s]  you just figured it out quick quick quick quick quick smelly boy tweet that
[25089.45s -> 25092.29s]  tweet that so it's yours someone's gonna do that someone's gonna tweet that right
[25092.29s -> 25096.78s]  now and get like 5,000 likes on it don't let him steal your original content
[25096.78s -> 25106.33s]  tweet that right now that's a great tweet don't let that get stolen from you
[25106.33s -> 25125.31s]  guys get open Twitter real quick like we're all doing it thief thief thief
[25125.31s -> 25131.80s]  thief now that's yeah that's true it's true that doesn't make a lot of sense
[25131.84s -> 25139.26s]  hey Keith King Crimson thanks for the 250 the ultimate evolution of Sonic
[25139.26s -> 25142.58s]  going faster is making an idle clicker game where you keep increasing Sonic's
[25142.58s -> 25149.90s]  speed not a bad idea tweet that tweet that and make it yours except take away
[25149.90s -> 25157.17s]  Sonic have it be a different character speedo quick tweet it so it's yours
[25157.17s -> 25164.92s]  don't let anybody take that you wrote it here first I got it I have I have
[25164.92s -> 25172.40s]  documentation that you said that writer Keith King Crimson at 1943 p.m. on October
[25172.40s -> 25181.73s]  3rd 2019 said those words done it's now it's here forever not a bad idea though
[25181.73s -> 25185.17s]  hey gnarly thanks for the 250 I think this stream has solidified the fact that
[25185.17s -> 25191.32s]  I have the worst taste in German streams what I really like the Clocktower 3
[25191.32s -> 25196.83s]  Hearthstone and now the NGU stream good lord that doesn't mean you can take my
[25196.83s -> 25203.68s]  recommendations any less seriously Clocktower 3 was one of the top five
[25203.68s -> 25213.81s]  streams I've ever done what do you mean bad taste that was like one of my
[25213.81s -> 25224.69s]  favorite streams ever like top 10 really top 15 when did I do Clocktower 3 that
[25224.69s -> 25229.88s]  was a while ago was it like that was in Vegas though right that was post Vegas
[25229.88s -> 25236.44s]  move six months ago seven months ago something like that earlier earlier this
[25236.44s -> 25244.07s]  last year something like that you don't have bad taste we time Hearthstone all
[25244.07s -> 25249.10s]  right I'm gonna have to disagree with you because I think that streams bad hey
[25249.10s -> 25254.74s]  doesn't matter how bad that stream was I opened 50 packs automatic good content
[25254.74s -> 25276.76s]  I had to go during the clicker RPG thing what happened I slayed some demons the
[25276.76s -> 25283.25s]  numbers went up they did yeah thank you bone jackal for the 500 bits germ I've
[25283.25s -> 25286.13s]  been stuck in this car going past your house for hours trying to get your
[25286.13s -> 25290.93s]  attention if I slow down below 70 miles per hour you're doing a speed joke okay
[25290.93s -> 25305.04s]  please get out of here help me this is a speed thing all right well what's my
[25305.04s -> 25309.36s]  favorite stream all of them except for Mario tennis that's actually the stream
[25309.36s -> 25312.92s]  that I don't I like the least like if I could delete a stream from everybody's
[25312.92s -> 25315.88s]  memory would be that one if I had like a genie that came up with three wishes one
[25315.88s -> 25326.62s]  of them would be to delete the Mario tennis stream like I never happened not
[25326.62s -> 25329.30s]  even the bird the birdhouse stream was fucking awesome we talking about that
[25329.30s -> 25334.14s]  was that was great I made a birdhouse on stream you I still own it I still have
[25334.14s -> 25344.76s]  it it's out there birds are in it 23 hours from now you know I should do like
[25344.76s -> 25365.08s]  a German lie emote but it's German 23 HR German 23 HRS interesting but thank you
[25365.08s -> 25369.28s]  bone jackal hopefully you figure it out hey white Fox thanks for the thousand
[25369.28s -> 25373.86s]  bits hey man because you're basically my therapist here we go I started a PhD in
[25373.86s -> 25378.62s]  genetics this month holy shit but it's four hours from my fiance and we miss
[25378.62s -> 25383.42s]  each other long-distance wedding planning is ass considering just
[25383.42s -> 25387.50s]  dropping the program and moving to be closer to her have some connections with
[25387.50s -> 25392.96s]  entomology closer to her but it pays less what's your advice also more
[25392.96s -> 25400.72s]  importantly it hits her ass I'd read that okay I'm a whole I'm a whole picture
[25400.72s -> 25404.16s]  kind of guy there you go it's your answer that one why did I answer it I
[25404.16s -> 25411.44s]  don't know but to answer the other question you need to do what you fuck
[25411.44s -> 25424.12s]  you need to do what you think you need to do what you think is best if you
[25424.12s -> 25429.61s]  think that making more money is more important to you then do it if you think
[25429.61s -> 25433.96s]  that being closer to somebody that you really care about is more important to
[25433.96s -> 25439.06s]  do it you are right now you are getting telltale to right now unfortunately it
[25439.06s -> 25444.51s]  happens at least a few times in everybody's life you get telltale
[25455.87s -> 25461.59s]  no no you have like a choice that affects your life that is really one or
[25461.59s -> 25469.88s]  the other it depends how much less money right it is if are you talking like a
[25469.88s -> 25474.80s]  million versus like 50 grand you know I'm saying is it like ridiculously less
[25474.80s -> 25488.80s]  then that weighs a little more right weddings are really pricey they are I
[25488.80s -> 25500.14s]  would say if it's as large monetary gain yes but you also want to stay happy you
[25500.18s -> 25506.38s]  want to keep yourself happy if work is not going to make you happy then do the
[25506.38s -> 25510.27s]  thing that's going to make you happy if being closer to somebody that you really
[25510.27s -> 25513.91s]  care about is going to make you feel better and your job that you could do
[25513.91s -> 25519.61s]  there better I would say do that because you don't want to run into a scenario
[25519.61s -> 25524.82s]  where you're very far away and you're making a little bit more money but you
[25524.82s -> 25530.84s]  wish you weren't doing that you need to be completely comfortable with that
[25530.84s -> 25542.16s]  decision and I think the comfortable decision is the second one but it also
[25542.16s -> 25548.39s]  depends as a lot of factors here it appeared how much do you want that PhD
[25548.39s -> 25559.21s]  how long is it gonna take if you can put up with doing that for a little while to
[25559.21s -> 25567.42s]  get your PhD and do that then it might be worth it you know I'm saying why are
[25567.42s -> 25575.96s]  you asking this motherfucker for advice
[25576.48s -> 25591.24s]  easy I'm trying to help no but for real it's given advice like this is tough
[25591.24s -> 25596.21s]  because I don't know where your priorities lie everybody has different
[25596.21s -> 25600.66s]  priorities everybody has a pre shit prep everybody's a post shit prep some
[25600.66s -> 25610.71s]  people stretch that's what I've heard but your plan has to be what you want not
[25610.71s -> 25615.51s]  what I would want because I don't know if what I want is what you would want to
[25617.63s -> 25626.44s]  to me it sounds like you are putting a lot of weight on being closer to the
[25626.44s -> 25637.36s]  person that you love sometimes that on the scale tips way more and depending on
[25637.36s -> 25641.32s]  how loud like I said how long it takes for you to get that PhD it might be
[25641.32s -> 25647.09s]  worth doing it and then moving depends on how badly you want I'm avoiding the
[25647.09s -> 25649.99s]  question I just I just said I just said the second one's probably a better idea
[25649.99s -> 25656.72s]  I just said it I just did it I just said it I just said it I just said that okay
[25657.28s -> 25668.84s]  I already said it he asked for advice not a self-help novel well I would how
[25668.84s -> 25676.15s]  do you give advice but advice that is advice I am given advice that that's
[25676.15s -> 25682.92s]  what I'm doing white Fox don't listen to these
[25682.92s -> 25694.62s]  jokers in here but I the most important question there was you know I answered
[25694.62s -> 25704.44s]  it for you jokers you're doing your best but all jokes
[25704.44s -> 25707.76s]  decided it's hard to give advice when I don't know the kind of gravity of the
[25707.76s -> 25715.12s]  situation I don't know what you really want it's gonna take a lot of thinking
[25715.12s -> 25722.49s]  but hopefully you figure it out I really do wish you the best but if you're good
[25722.49s -> 25728.58s]  at something never do it for free that's exactly yes hey Aqua Reaper thanks for
[25728.58s -> 25733.56s]  the thousand and five bits Jerma how do you feel that I live in your house and
[25733.56s -> 25737.00s]  always remain out of sight waiting to strangle you well that was fucking
[25737.00s -> 25747.57s]  strange when you finally catch a shiny Pokemon Jerma how do you feel that I live
[25747.57s -> 25751.05s]  in your house and always remain out of sight waiting to strangle you to death
