[0.82s -> 11.10s]  Hello, good afternoon everybody. Uh, sorry I'm a little late again today, but Otto seems to be on
[11.10s -> 19.51s]  this, uh, new bathroom schedule, where at 12 o'clock, he's like, I'm, it's, I'm gonna go outside,
[19.51s -> 24.47s]  I have to go outside now. He's like, all right, let's go. So he's, uh, he's been on a different,
[24.47s -> 39.14s]  like, pee and poo schedule. Guess like clockwork. Yeah, actually though, but actually. Do I remember,
[39.14s -> 51.22s]  do I remember what? Wait a minute. The 21st day of September. Of course I do. I get it. Yeah,
[51.22s -> 61.98s]  yeah, yeah. Oh shit, now I want to listen to that song on repeat for four hours. I do remember,
[61.98s -> 72.07s]  yeah. Do it. I'm not going to do that. That's, that's not good content. That's painful. It's
[72.07s -> 78.70s]  one of the best songs ever made, but that's, nobody wants to hear the same song for the whole
[78.70s -> 86.46s]  stream. It would be horrible. Do it once. I will. We're going to play Super Monkey Ball today. It's
[86.46s -> 93.82s]  been a long time coming. I'm ready. I've been told that this game is very fun. I've been told this
[93.82s -> 101.66s]  game is very hard. Uh, the how to beat has this game at four and a half hours. So you can assume
[101.66s -> 108.79s]  that I'll get stuck on like level four for about four hours. So it's probably going to be like a
[108.79s -> 117.26s]  eight hour experience. Who beats this game? It's first try in four and a half hours. I don't think
[117.26s -> 123.42s]  anybody does that. Sometimes I'll look at like the how to beat. I know it's an average, but then
[123.42s -> 129.02s]  you'll look at kind of, you go down to the, to the actual menu that shows the times. Like completionists,
[129.02s -> 135.62s]  first timers, right? Can't you see that? How the fuck do people do that? Oh, Dark Souls. Yeah,
[135.62s -> 143.34s]  I beat Dark Souls on my first attempt, my first playthrough in 18 hours. No, you didn't. You walked
[143.34s -> 148.86s]  around the fucking swamp for four hours at least in like Dark Souls two, Dark Souls three. Who,
[148.86s -> 155.27s]  how do you do that without a guide? I mean, that's normal. That's not normal.
[156.07s -> 162.68s]  Should be playing Super Monkey Ball 2 or Deluxe. I'm really sorry to tell you.
[162.68s -> 171.34s]  This is just Super Monkey Ball for the GameCube. I asked, I made it really clear. I said, hey,
[171.34s -> 177.74s]  what version is like Super Monkey Ball 2, PC, Mac? And everyone screamed at me. They said,
[177.74s -> 181.26s]  oh, Super Monkey Ball for the Nintendo GameCube. Don't play anything else. And I was like, okay,
[181.26s -> 195.35s]  fine. This is boo. It's not Deluxe. Does it need to be Deluxe? No, fuck Deluxe. I don't want
[195.35s -> 200.47s]  pepperoni, olives, onions, anchovies. I don't want that all over my pizza. Just give me the,
[200.47s -> 210.12s]  like a pepperoni or like just pepper and onions. I don't want your Deluxe pizza bullshit. That's
[210.12s -> 213.96s]  too much stuff to put on a pizza. That's too much stuff to put in Super Monkey Ball, the original
[213.96s -> 226.07s]  GameCube version. Let's go. Here we go. Here. Are you watching? Are you ready? Which says you're
[226.07s -> 237.29s]  playing the one for Vita? What? Okay. Okay. I looked over here and I see that stream preview.
[237.29s -> 244.06s]  I see a game called Hamster Ball. I was like, wait, that's not this. Is that the Vita? No,
[244.06s -> 252.86s]  that's my title. It's Super Monkey Ball, not from PS Vita. Super Monkey Ball Banana Splits.
[254.06s -> 266.07s]  Shit. Super Monkey Ball. There it is. All right. Refresh. Well, I, okay, I don't want it to be
[266.07s -> 274.12s]  Banana Splits. How do I make it just the regular one? What the flying fuck is all this?
[274.12s -> 278.52s]  Super Monkey Ball 2, Super Monkey Ball Ticket Blitz, Super Monkey Ball, Super Monkey Ball 2,
[278.52s -> 282.68s]  Sakura Edition, Super Monkey Ball Adventure, Super Monkey Ball Deluxe, Super Monkey Ball Banana
[282.68s -> 287.32s]  Blitz HD, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz Splits, Super Monkey Ball 3D, Super Monkey Ball Step and
[287.32s -> 293.74s]  Roll, Monkey Ball Junior, Monkey Ball Banana Blitz. How many games do they have? I thought
[293.74s -> 303.78s]  there was two. Super Monkey Ball. I just, okay, it should be, I just clicked Super Monkey Ball,
[303.78s -> 313.43s]  but it's just, it won't, it'll only do Banana Splits. Why I wanted, what's going on here? Why
[313.43s -> 322.23s]  is it doing that? I select Super Monkey Ball and it goes Banana Splits. Is it fixed? Who cares? Let's
[322.23s -> 328.66s]  go. It don't matter. If you see Super Monkey Ball in the title, just know that it's one of the
[328.66s -> 339.67s]  apparently 15 fucking Jason movies this game has. Let's go. Super Monkey Ball.
[343.24s -> 347.48s]  Main game, party game, mini game, main game, right? Make sure to guide the monkeys in the balls to
[347.48s -> 357.99s]  the goal as quickly as possible. There's no sound. Oops. We're good. I just played the game
[357.99s -> 365.96s]  completely with no audio. Okay. Main game. Yeah. Main game. Normal practice or competition.
[367.08s -> 372.87s]  All right. So let's do normal. This is definitely a Sega game. I can already tell. It is, right?
[373.43s -> 379.54s]  It's a Sega game. That's the Sega guy that talks after you touch stuff on one player.
[381.70s -> 388.66s]  Okay. I, I, me, me, baby, or gone, gone. Okay. I think it's going to have to be baby.
[394.50s -> 404.25s]  I, I, or it's going to be baby. It has to be. But do they have powers? B add X. Beginner 10 stage,
[404.89s -> 411.93s]  advanced 30 straight, expert 50 stages. Let's do beginner first. What? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
[411.93s -> 418.66s]  I have a question. Is this like Mario party where it's just adding more stages on top
[420.31s -> 425.80s]  or do the other completely different stages? So I got to go through beginner first.
[427.45s -> 431.54s]  They're all different. They're all different. They're all. All right. Let's go. I'm ready.
[431.54s -> 444.89s]  So there are fucking like a hundred stages. Oh, well, this looks easy. Ready? Go. All right.
[444.89s -> 455.83s]  That's fun. So it's like, it's okay. But it saves the replays. Bananas, three out of a hundred.
[455.83s -> 464.76s]  You just got to collect the bananas. Do I have that actual time limit or no?
[465.32s -> 481.48s]  Yeah, I do. It's right there. Oh, my like audio is so fucked up. Watch the replay for a second.
[481.48s -> 497.02s]  Hey, I got to get new. Okay. I swear to God. Go. Where is it? Oh, sick. This is cool. Yeah. All
[497.02s -> 507.37s]  right. This is like playing Sonic, but you actually get to watch rather than go. Did I make it?
[508.09s -> 521.96s]  Is there a jump? How do I jump? Oh, so there's no camera either. It's just whatever way you're
[521.96s -> 549.90s]  going to go. All right. Okay. I got 40 seconds of plenty of time. Oh, shit. You go fast. You'll
[549.90s -> 557.48s]  bounce. Oh, it has a miles per hour. That's cool. Bonus floor. Collect all the bananas. All right.
[557.48s -> 572.41s]  Okay. I got time. That's why this is beginner. I get it. Shit. I'm doing such a bad job mowing
[572.41s -> 584.10s]  the banana lawn. I can do better than this. They'll have dole on them. Wait a minute.
[584.92s -> 599.48s]  Is this a sponsored video game? Dole bananas. All right. I got them now. Oh, partially. Yes.
[599.48s -> 605.00s]  Oh, no. This looks like it's a little more complicated. Okay. So this one is,
[606.68s -> 610.60s]  how fast should I be going? You got to take corners tight.
[613.46s -> 620.58s]  Okay. This game's fun. I like this game very much. It's okay. It's all right. It's fine. It's fine.
[621.93s -> 635.50s]  It's going to happen at least once. Wait, do I have lives? Wait, when I run out of lives,
[635.50s -> 647.93s]  do I run out of lives? Yes. But you know what I mean? Do I have to start over? You do. Wait.
[648.73s -> 659.16s]  Oh, I missed one. No, I can't get it. I hate it. I hate that. I hate it. I have to get it.
[661.51s -> 673.77s]  Whatever. That sucks. You can continue. Okay. That's good. Shit. Can I go back and play that
[673.77s -> 680.38s]  one again? All right. How many bananas are here? What happens when I get 100 bananas?
[681.02s -> 698.15s]  Did I miss some back here? Get these. There we go. Okay. I got to make this cleaner.
[698.79s -> 713.54s]  No wonder I'm going to fucking throw up. Oh, that's a bunch. You definitely will need those lives.
[713.54s -> 731.96s]  Okay. I'm going the goal yet. Get it perfect. Perfect. Missed one. I'm good. Or eight. All
[731.96s -> 748.26s]  right. We only have two more floors. Oh, this is bad. Okay. Let's do it slow. No. I don't know
[748.26s -> 752.60s]  what I was thinking. I don't know what I was thinking. I thought I could go. I don't know.
[758.10s -> 780.98s]  Holy shit. No, this is hard. I'm okay. It isn't. Yes, it is. All right. I'm going to wait.
[780.98s -> 790.26s]  Poor baby monkey. You are on the dole. What? What do you mean I'm on the dole? What does that mean?
[796.54s -> 801.10s]  Can I go? I'm not going to go. I'm not going to go. I'm going to wait.
[805.34s -> 808.46s]  Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[808.46s -> 822.76s]  Rolling. Stop. Rolling. Stop. Rolling. Don't. 15 seconds. I know I'm going. It isn't just for lives.
[822.76s -> 834.26s]  Yeah, but you have to get them. Okay. Floor nine. This one looks cool. This one just dumps you down
[834.26s -> 850.28s]  there. All right. Don't go that fast. What? You have received 228 play points. You now have a
[850.28s -> 852.28s]  I have a total of 228 play points.
[852.28s -> 854.65s]  I'm gonna go again.
[854.65s -> 861.18s]  What do you mean sad? Why is that sad?
[861.18s -> 863.18s]  I'm just my first time
[863.18s -> 865.18s]  playing Super Monkey Ball 3D.
[865.18s -> 869.72s]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[869.72s -> 877.96s]  This isn't 2D.
[877.96s -> 879.96s]  How did I fuck that up? I don't even know. I don't know how I messed that up.
[879.96s -> 891.93s]  I don't know.
[891.93s -> 895.45s]  Oh my fucking god.
[895.45s -> 897.62s]  Why? I need some coffee.
[897.62s -> 899.62s]  I gotta get coffee. Let me drink some coffee
[899.62s -> 904.36s]  for a second. Just wait.
[904.36s -> 916.78s]  Okay. Get some good cider.
[916.78s -> 920.41s]  Stop.
[920.41s -> 924.82s]  Let's line it up.
[924.82s -> 931.59s]  I took way longer than it should have.
[931.59s -> 933.59s]  This is it. Final floor of Beginner.
[933.59s -> 935.59s]  This is to teach you how to play.
[935.59s -> 942.25s]  Oh. Thank god there's
[942.25s -> 947.05s]  bumpers. I wish I could turn
[947.05s -> 952.30s]  the camera just a little. I think I'll be
[952.30s -> 955.18s]  fine on this one. I'm not gonna fall.
[955.18s -> 959.21s]  This one has divots.
[959.21s -> 961.21s]  My chair was just shaking too at the same time.
[961.21s -> 966.97s]  I was just rolling down the
[966.97s -> 971.70s]  stairs in my chair.
[971.70s -> 977.08s]  Oh god damn it.
[977.08s -> 981.88s]  It says no. I can't even fucking do it.
[981.88s -> 990.46s]  Don't say hurry up.
[990.46s -> 992.46s]  Don't listen to them. Just go normally. Do normal.
[992.46s -> 1001.93s]  Normal. I'm fine.
[1001.93s -> 1004.23s]  Alright. I got here with 30
[1004.23s -> 1006.23s]  seconds the last time. I got plenty more time.
[1006.23s -> 1013.51s]  Alright. Line this up. Don't be a fucking
[1013.51s -> 1021.38s]  idiot.
[1021.38s -> 1024.39s]  This is hard.
[1024.39s -> 1026.39s]  This is very tricky. It's tricky.
[1026.39s -> 1029.40s]  Okay. Do you guys know that game
[1029.40s -> 1031.40s]  where you have the marble in that little plastic
[1031.40s -> 1033.40s]  device and you have to tilt it around and put it
[1033.40s -> 1035.40s]  inside of the hole in the middle of the little device?
[1035.40s -> 1037.70s]  I was never any good at that. I always
[1037.70s -> 1039.70s]  freaked the fuck out. I always went over
[1039.70s -> 1041.70s]  it. Went over it. Went over it.
[1041.70s -> 1043.70s]  Went too hard. Went too hard. Went too hard. Went too soft.
[1043.70s -> 1045.70s]  And then I would just throw the thing in the trash.
[1045.70s -> 1048.26s]  Like who even cares?
[1048.26s -> 1060.17s]  That's not gonna impress anybody.
[1060.17s -> 1062.17s]  All that does is just take some
[1062.17s -> 1068.38s]  annoying time to get that right.
[1068.38s -> 1070.38s]  If you show somebody you do that they just go oh yeah
[1070.38s -> 1072.38s]  I also one day was
[1072.38s -> 1074.38s]  a fucking asshole and spent
[1074.38s -> 1076.38s]  45 minutes trying to get a ball in the middle of a hole.
[1076.38s -> 1094.60s]  He hates this.
[1094.60s -> 1097.74s]  You know what's funny?
[1097.74s -> 1099.74s]  When I was just being annoyed
[1099.74s -> 1101.74s]  I almost did the whole thing in one go.
[1101.74s -> 1104.74s]  I can't focus.
[1104.74s -> 1106.74s]  I don't want to focus on this.
[1106.74s -> 1108.74s]  Games like this if I don't focus I do better.
[1108.74s -> 1110.74s]  Give me a talk. Somebody give me a topic.
[1110.74s -> 1112.74s]  Right now. Give me a topic.
[1112.74s -> 1120.36s]  Oranges.
[1120.36s -> 1123.43s]  No oranges are gross.
[1123.43s -> 1126.70s]  I'm one of those people that thinks that oranges are gross.
[1126.70s -> 1128.70s]  I actually like clementines though.
[1128.70s -> 1130.70s]  Clementines are exactly what you want.
[1130.70s -> 1132.70s]  You want just a little bit of orange.
[1132.70s -> 1134.70s]  They don't get slimy. They don't have that weird white
[1134.70s -> 1140.07s]  film on them.
[1140.07s -> 1142.07s]  You can peel them so easily.
[1142.07s -> 1144.07s]  Alright. Didn't work.
[1144.07s -> 1146.07s]  It didn't work. It didn't work.
[1146.07s -> 1148.07s]  Just relax. I'm gonna get it right now.
[1148.07s -> 1160.10s]  This is beginner. Great.
[1160.10s -> 1162.10s]  I'm gonna be good.
[1162.10s -> 1164.60s]  How long has it been? 20 minutes?
[1164.60s -> 1167.61s]  That's like a good
[1167.61s -> 1169.61s]  meaty stream right? 20 minutes?
[1169.61s -> 1174.09s]  How long is this
[1174.09s -> 1176.09s]  Joe Rogan podcast? 40 minutes?
[1176.09s -> 1181.85s]  Alright. I'm good.
[1181.85s -> 1206.09s]  My computer just crashed. I'm good.
[1206.09s -> 1208.09s]  That was really weird. My computer just hard
[1208.09s -> 1210.09s]  crashed. Like it was hanging.
[1210.09s -> 1216.17s]  Exposed. What do you mean exposed? I only got
[1216.17s -> 1219.56s]  14 seconds!
[1219.56s -> 1221.56s]  Hey! You guys have clementines. I like how you can peel
[1221.56s -> 1223.56s]  them with your hands. They're much much
[1223.56s -> 1225.56s]  softer than a regular orange.
[1225.56s -> 1227.56s]  If you agree with me give me a fucking retweet!
[1227.56s -> 1241.58s]  Yes! It really is an ad.
[1241.58s -> 1245.29s]  You got 100 points altogether. You have
[1245.29s -> 1248.62s]  357 points.
[1248.62s -> 1250.62s]  Only 2143
[1250.62s -> 1252.62s]  points left to unlock
[1252.62s -> 1254.62s]  the next
[1254.62s -> 1261.72s]  game. Remember when people
[1261.72s -> 1263.72s]  used to try to pay me to talk like that?
[1263.72s -> 1266.34s]  I just did that for free.
[1266.34s -> 1274.14s]  What's this? Oh
[1274.14s -> 1282.58s]  this is cool. It's like Sonic
[1282.58s -> 1284.58s]  if you touch anything you lose them?
[1284.58s -> 1292.39s]  Okay so nobody can say I didn't beat Super
[1292.39s -> 1294.39s]  Monkey Ball. We're not talking about
[1294.39s -> 1296.95s]  difficulty. We're just talking about completion.
[1296.95s -> 1303.29s]  None of you can say I didn't do it. Super
[1303.29s -> 1306.30s]  Monkey Ball. I can't believe there
[1306.30s -> 1308.30s]  are this many. I really can't.
[1308.30s -> 1310.66s]  I was always under the assumption that there was two.
[1310.66s -> 1313.16s]  That there was one for the GameCube
[1313.16s -> 1315.16s]  and then one for the iPad that
[1315.16s -> 1317.72s]  nobody liked. Or Dreamcast.
[1317.72s -> 1319.90s]  I always thought that Dreamcast
[1319.90s -> 1321.90s]  came out with one and then they came out with one like a remake
[1321.90s -> 1333.29s]  for the GameCube. What's your high
[1333.29s -> 1336.22s]  score here? Huh?
[1336.22s -> 1343.38s]  What's your high score here huh? The iPad
[1343.38s -> 1352.92s]  fucking sucks. Alright can I skip this?
[1352.92s -> 1354.92s]  I know everyone's gonna be mad if I do. But can
[1354.92s -> 1363.24s]  I? Just quit back to menu.
[1363.24s -> 1365.24s]  Well let me just say how much I can get on my first run.
[1365.24s -> 1370.62s]  Skip it! I
[1370.62s -> 1375.22s]  can't! There's no skipping!
[1375.22s -> 1380.54s]  It's a forced cut scene
[1380.54s -> 1385.21s]  guys. I can't skip it.
[1385.21s -> 1392.44s]  We're almost done. Look in the
[1392.44s -> 1397.18s]  credits. You're losing bananas.
[1397.18s -> 1401.34s]  Alright how about this? Whatever
[1401.34s -> 1403.34s]  I have for a total banana count at the end is how many
[1403.34s -> 1407.18s]  community subs I will give.
[1407.18s -> 1418.95s]  How's that sound? That sounds good to me.
[1418.95s -> 1428.62s]  I hope we're
[1428.62s -> 1430.62s]  not near the end of the
[1430.62s -> 1442.07s]  credits. How much of roll
[1442.07s -> 1444.38s]  is over now?
[1444.38s -> 1446.38s]  How many do I have to...oh so far?
[1446.38s -> 1448.38s]  Oh shit!
[1448.38s -> 1450.74s]  Huh fuck! I'm hitting
[1450.74s -> 1457.40s]  things. Oops!
[1457.40s -> 1459.40s]  Oh don't
[1459.40s -> 1462.79s]  crap!
[1462.79s -> 1469.26s]  No! I really don't.
[1469.26s -> 1471.26s]  Hold on. I don't want to give
[1471.26s -> 1473.26s]  like...wait wait wait what does that
[1473.26s -> 1475.26s]  mean? What does that mean? What does that mean?
[1475.26s -> 1477.26s]  Minus...wait that's how many subs I
[1477.26s -> 1481.42s]  get now. No no no
[1481.42s -> 1483.42s]  no no no no. You're gonna twist that on me somehow.
[1483.42s -> 1486.87s]  You twist that on me. I gotta get it to
[1486.87s -> 1490.97s]  zero. You guys are gonna twist it.
[1490.97s -> 1493.40s]  They'll be like, no no dude because you went negative
[1493.40s -> 1495.40s]  now it's like you've minus...you have to
[1495.40s -> 1497.40s]  like deduct those subs into our count.
[1497.40s -> 1502.39s]  Let's just stay at fucking zero.
[1502.39s -> 1507.90s]  Let's go to
[1507.90s -> 1511.42s]  minus two.
[1511.42s -> 1513.59s]  Come on
[1513.59s -> 1515.59s]  perfectly balanced is how things should be.
[1515.59s -> 1520.26s]  Shit I'm really not trying to hit this
[1520.26s -> 1524.30s]  thing. I'm really trying to get it to...
[1524.30s -> 1527.11s]  Oh no. No it doesn't
[1527.11s -> 1529.11s]  go the other way. I didn't make that. I gotta make
[1529.11s -> 1532.25s]  that really clear. Let's be very
[1532.25s -> 1534.62s]  clear here. No it doesn't
[1534.62s -> 1536.62s]  matter if it goes negative. It doesn't mean anything.
[1536.62s -> 1543.14s]  No I don't wanna.
[1543.14s -> 1545.96s]  I don't wanna. There's the goal.
[1545.96s -> 1547.96s]  Alright come on. Perfectly balanced is how things should be.
[1547.96s -> 1560.06s]  Okay.
[1560.06s -> 1564.22s]  Oh wait. Fuck you.
[1564.22s -> 1571.00s]  No. That doesn't mean anything.
[1571.00s -> 1573.00s]  That's one two three.
[1573.00s -> 1575.18s]  I went minus one two three.
[1575.18s -> 1579.72s]  I was just trying to get to
[1579.72s -> 1581.72s]  dash one two three.
[1581.72s -> 1583.72s]  That's not one hundred and twenty three.
[1583.72s -> 1585.72s]  Unsub. Oh shit.
[1585.72s -> 1589.30s]  One hundred and twenty three of you guys have to
[1589.30s -> 1595.90s]  unsub. That's not good.
[1595.90s -> 1597.90s]  No no. Whoa whoa whoa. Hold on. Wait. Don't do...
[1597.90s -> 1599.90s]  Don't get too hasty
[1599.90s -> 1601.90s]  here because what's gonna happen is like
[1601.90s -> 1603.90s]  okay if I say press one
[1603.90s -> 1605.90s]  in the chat. Hey ten of you press one in the chat.
[1605.90s -> 1607.90s]  Two thousand of you are gonna press one in the chat.
[1607.90s -> 1609.90s]  If I say oh a hundred of you
[1609.90s -> 1611.90s]  need to unsub. Five
[1611.90s -> 1613.90s]  thousand of you are gonna unsub.
[1613.90s -> 1616.52s]  Let's not get
[1616.52s -> 1618.52s]  too hasty there. Don't get too hasty
[1618.52s -> 1625.11s]  there. What does this want me to do?
[1625.11s -> 1633.67s]  Oh.
[1633.67s -> 1636.04s]  I don't care. Enter your name.
[1636.04s -> 1639.67s]  That's my name.
[1639.67s -> 1645.42s]  Hi. Everybody
[1645.42s -> 1649.38s]  unsub. If you don't unsub
[1649.38s -> 1651.38s]  you're encouraging bad behavior.
[1651.38s -> 1653.38s]  Don't do that. You're going
[1653.38s -> 1655.38s]  over it. You are messing with
[1655.38s -> 1658.52s]  things that you are not to mess with.
[1658.52s -> 1660.52s]  What's like the villain say
[1660.52s -> 1662.52s]  in the movie when things are too powerful?
[1662.52s -> 1664.52s]  You're messing with forces that you do not know.
[1664.52s -> 1676.36s]  Something like that right?
[1676.36s -> 1678.36s]  Alright. Should we stay with...
[1678.36s -> 1681.69s]  Let's go Mimi. We'll do advanced.
[1681.69s -> 1688.66s]  I thought you guys said that it wasn't
[1688.66s -> 1690.66s]  just packed on levels.
[1690.66s -> 1700.39s]  Wait. Did somebody just gave a hundred subs?
[1700.39s -> 1702.39s]  Wait. Hold on. Somebody...
[1702.39s -> 1705.02s]  ZombieEater just gave a hundred community subs.
[1708.79s -> 1712.44s]  That's a lot. That's a shit
[1712.44s -> 1714.44s]  low sub. Thank you for the hundred subs.
[1714.44s -> 1717.45s]  Okay. Now those
[1717.45s -> 1719.45s]  hundred people delete them. Like just take
[1719.45s -> 1721.75s]  off your sub. Right after getting it.
[1721.75s -> 1723.75s]  Don't do that though.
[1723.75s -> 1726.18s]  Money. You know what I mean? Money.
[1726.18s -> 1729.64s]  Mini golf course.
[1729.64s -> 1733.10s]  Okay. A hundred
[1733.10s -> 1735.10s]  from...hold on.
[1735.10s -> 1737.10s]  A hundred from ZombieEater and
[1737.10s -> 1739.10s]  twenty-three from FireLactors. You guys are fucking crazy.
[1739.10s -> 1743.83s]  Thank you both of you. That's
[1743.83s -> 1745.83s]  an extreme amount of money.
[1745.83s -> 1755.93s]  How did I not get those? Got it.
[1755.93s -> 1760.86s]  Okay. Good. Quickly. Quickly. Quickly.
[1760.86s -> 1762.86s]  Quickly. Quickly. Quickly. Quickly.
[1762.86s -> 1766.81s]  I didn't even know that's what they did.
[1766.81s -> 1770.20s]  I don't know the game mechanic.
[1770.20s -> 1772.70s]  And by the way. Stupid game
[1772.70s -> 1776.60s]  mechanic by the way.
[1776.60s -> 1778.60s]  That wasn't me. That was the game mechanics.
[1778.60s -> 1790.63s]  Bad because bad. Mad because bad.
[1790.63s -> 1792.63s]  But no seriously. That's fucking hundreds of dollars guys.
[1792.63s -> 1794.63s]  We joke around. But that's a lot of money.
[1794.63s -> 1808.31s]  Thank you.
[1808.31s -> 1812.34s]  Just moving my rubber duckies around.
[1812.34s -> 1814.34s]  I'm the number one streamer that streams in a bathtub.
[1814.34s -> 1818.82s]  Oh shit.
[1818.82s -> 1829.45s]  Okay. That's not what I wanted.
[1829.45s -> 1832.01s]  I don't care about bananas. I care about completion.
[1832.01s -> 1834.82s]  I didn't get any. But I don't care.
[1834.82s -> 1836.82s]  Do you care? Do you actually
[1836.82s -> 1840.54s]  care? I don't. I care about completion.
[1840.54s -> 1849.30s]  I'm just holding up.
[1849.30s -> 1856.97s]  Didn't move fast enough. Nevermind.
[1856.97s -> 1858.97s]  You received 69 playpoints. You now have
[1858.97s -> 1860.97s]  a total of 426
[1860.97s -> 1864.94s]  playpoints. What are the party
[1864.94s -> 1866.94s]  games you can unlock? That seems kind of fun.
[1866.94s -> 1870.71s]  Alright. I'm going to wait and go now.
[1870.71s -> 1876.54s]  This one's going to be tricky. Okay.
[1876.54s -> 1878.84s]  This one's going to take me a while. Just a
[1878.84s -> 1887.99s]  minute. It's going to be like five minutes.
[1887.99s -> 1899.43s]  Come on. Hurry up. Go back.
[1899.43s -> 1904.55s]  Can I do this in one go?
[1904.55s -> 1917.22s]  I can. Imagine
[1917.22s -> 1919.22s]  there being a casino minigame.
[1919.22s -> 1921.78s]  Is that your way to tell me that there's a casino
[1921.78s -> 1925.62s]  minigame in this? Is that the way
[1925.62s -> 1929.98s]  you're going to let me know? Do I get to bet
[1929.98s -> 1931.98s]  my dull bananas?
[1931.98s -> 1937.02s]  Like a slot machine?
[1937.02s -> 1939.02s]  I see. Okay. I'm seeing the grins.
[1939.02s -> 1944.97s]  This is the most inefficient way to fucking
[1944.97s -> 1946.97s]  do this level. It's unbelievable.
[1946.97s -> 1957.00s]  I almost didn't make it either. Each
[1957.00s -> 1959.50s]  time you fall, you
[1959.50s -> 1963.78s]  what? I want to spoil it. I'll get them all
[1963.78s -> 1975.88s]  here. Spiral. Just do a spiral.
[1975.88s -> 1978.44s]  I don't have enough time.
[1978.44s -> 2001.99s]  Sorry. I had to let all the air out of my body for
[2001.99s -> 2011.34s]  a second. Okay. Good to know.
[2011.34s -> 2019.27s]  You got to wait. You know what? I think
[2019.27s -> 2021.27s]  I have to go around the whole thing, right?
[2021.27s -> 2024.98s]  You got to wrap around.
[2024.98s -> 2028.76s]  What happened? I won?
[2028.76s -> 2033.61s]  Oh. I'll take it.
[2033.61s -> 2035.61s]  Oh shit. This is a silly straw. I don't like
[2035.61s -> 2038.55s]  this one. Oh, let me tell you guys
[2038.55s -> 2040.55s]  something real quick. I bought this elaborate
[2040.55s -> 2042.55s]  silly straw glasses thing where
[2042.55s -> 2044.55s]  it was a big straw that wrapped around my whole
[2044.55s -> 2046.55s]  body and went up around my eyes as
[2046.55s -> 2048.55s]  glasses. And I was going to turn it on
[2048.55s -> 2050.55s]  and drink stuff out of it.
[2050.55s -> 2052.55s]  I think it was funny.
[2052.55s -> 2054.55s]  I snapped it in half accidentally because it was so brittle.
[2054.55s -> 2056.79s]  I was setting up to do it.
[2056.79s -> 2058.79s]  I was putting it all around my body and shit.
[2058.79s -> 2061.93s]  And what's wrong
[2061.93s -> 2066.73s]  with my computer? I like need
[2066.73s -> 2069.48s]  a new computer. My like
[2069.48s -> 2072.36s]  Windows is crashing. What the
[2072.36s -> 2091.29s]  fuck is happening? Shit.
[2091.29s -> 2093.46s]  Why? He's getting
[2093.46s -> 2095.46s]  hacked. I'm not getting hacked.
[2095.46s -> 2107.74s]  What happened? Oh fuck.
[2107.74s -> 2110.68s]  That's not good. That's
[2110.68s -> 2113.69s]  not good. That's not good.
[2113.69s -> 2119.45s]  I swear to God every time I download a
[2119.45s -> 2121.45s]  Windows update, my computer gets
[2121.45s -> 2123.45s]  worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[2123.45s -> 2125.45s]  It's like I'm taking my car to the mechanic
[2125.45s -> 2128.20s]  and every time
[2128.20s -> 2130.20s]  I go to the mechanic, he unscrews
[2130.20s -> 2136.73s]  something else.
[2136.73s -> 2138.73s]  Hey, man, can you replace my
[2138.73s -> 2140.73s]  windshield wiper fluid? Yeah, I sure can.
[2140.73s -> 2142.73s]  And he puts
[2142.73s -> 2144.73s]  like a little bit of windshield wiper fluid in and
[2144.73s -> 2146.73s]  unscrews something underneath.
[2146.73s -> 2148.73s]  And then I come in to ask him, hey, I'm hearing like a rattling.
[2148.73s -> 2150.73s]  Let me check that out. And he opens it up
[2150.73s -> 2152.73s]  and just fucking, he just like pees in
[2152.73s -> 2155.10s]  the gas tank or something.
[2155.10s -> 2157.10s]  My gas tank smells like pee. Yeah.
[2157.10s -> 2159.34s]  Let me fix that.
[2159.34s -> 2162.98s]  And he pees in the wiper fluid.
[2162.98s -> 2166.50s]  He takes a hammer to like the tail light.
[2166.50s -> 2168.50s]  Like every time I get a Windows update, my computer
[2168.50s -> 2171.58s]  gets worse. My computer just
[2171.58s -> 2173.58s]  gets worse every time I download one.
[2173.58s -> 2175.58s]  And there's been a bunch of them lately. Like I caught
[2175.58s -> 2182.81s]  up. I caught up.
[2182.81s -> 2184.81s]  Okay, let's go. I'm ready.
[2184.81s -> 2194.73s]  Gotta love those monkey balls.
[2194.73s -> 2203.11s]  Yeah. Hey, what's the
[2203.11s -> 2205.48s]  like I'm asking because like a
[2205.48s -> 2207.48s]  friend of mine asked me one day like
[2207.48s -> 2209.48s]  yesterday, he said, hey, dude, what's the button
[2209.48s -> 2211.48s]  combination if you have
[2211.48s -> 2213.48s]  like a computer and you
[2213.48s -> 2215.48s]  have a program on your computer that emulates
[2215.48s -> 2218.17s]  video games? He's like, hey,
[2218.17s -> 2220.17s]  what's a button combination to save a state?
[2220.17s -> 2222.17s]  And I was like, I don't fucking know.
[2222.17s -> 2224.17s]  Leave me alone.
[2224.17s -> 2228.07s]  I was like, why would I know that? Leave me, shut up, dude.
[2228.07s -> 2234.92s]  Alt F4. Yes.
[2234.92s -> 2236.92s]  Yes, I did. Yeah, I know.
[2236.92s -> 2238.92s]  I just learned what a computer was yesterday.
[2238.92s -> 2241.74s]  What emulator is it? I don't
[2241.74s -> 2245.19s]  know.
[2245.19s -> 2247.19s]  Sea bass or something. It's some kind of sea
[2247.19s -> 2251.80s]  animal. He's like, yeah,
[2251.80s -> 2253.80s]  uh, fucking like swordfish like
[2253.80s -> 2255.80s]  2.1 or I don't know what the fuck
[2255.80s -> 2257.80s]  that is, dude. Get out of here. Get the fuck out of my house.
[2257.80s -> 2261.13s]  What would it like
[2261.13s -> 2272.90s]  if you asked, what could I tell him?
[2272.90s -> 2275.66s]  Shift F1.
[2275.66s -> 2277.66s]  But like make sure it's like right though because like this guy
[2279.66s -> 2281.66s]  This guy's really like powerful and I don't want to make
[2281.66s -> 2283.66s]  him like mad. What if he gets angry?
[2283.66s -> 2292.02s]  Report him.
[2292.02s -> 2298.42s]  Shift F12. Stop
[2298.42s -> 2301.82s]  it. Okay. Okay. That was Arnold
[2301.82s -> 2303.82s]  Schwarzenegger exact cadence.
[2303.82s -> 2306.25s]  But not doing Arnold
[2306.25s -> 2312.52s]  Schwarzenegger's voice. It's like somebody
[2312.52s -> 2314.52s]  pitch shifted Arnold saying that like
[2314.52s -> 2334.87s]  stop it. All right.
[2334.87s -> 2343.88s]  I gotta pay attention. Yep.
[2343.88s -> 2345.88s]  What's the shift F12?
[2345.88s -> 2348.70s]  You better not be lying to me. You better not be lying to
[2348.70s -> 2357.02s]  my friend Dave. Don't listen.
[2357.02s -> 2359.02s]  It's Alt F5. It's not
[2359.02s -> 2361.02s]  Alt F5. That would be stupid.
[2361.02s -> 2363.02s]  That's close your computer's
[2363.02s -> 2365.26s]  desktop. Shift F1.
[2365.26s -> 2367.26s]  You know what? I'm going to look it up for Dave.
[2367.26s -> 2369.26s]  He needs me. I'm going to look it up over here.
[2369.26s -> 2372.71s]  I don't trust anybody.
[2372.71s -> 2375.02s]  Dave's pissed. Dave's like a
[2375.02s -> 2377.02s]  wicked powerful senator.
[2377.02s -> 2380.07s]  I get this wrong.
[2380.07s -> 2382.07s]  Like introduce a bill to remove my fucking
[2382.07s -> 2385.08s]  stream. Oh no. I'm dead.
[2385.08s -> 2406.18s]  148
[2406.18s -> 2409.51s]  play point. Okay.
[2409.51s -> 2411.75s]  Yeah. You guys are right. It's
[2411.75s -> 2414.70s]  Yeah.
[2414.70s -> 2416.70s]  I got it tested for him.
[2416.70s -> 2418.70s]  I want to make sure it was correct.
[2418.70s -> 2425.61s]  Go in the goal.
[2425.61s -> 2432.90s]  Good link.
[2432.90s -> 2435.21s]  I did
[2435.21s -> 2437.21s]  a hee hee. I went a hee hee.
[2437.21s -> 2440.02s]  I never hee hee on this stream.
[2440.02s -> 2442.02s]  Okay. I'm not going to fucking
[2442.02s -> 2448.94s]  Why is this one messing me up so much?
[2448.94s -> 2456.23s]  What is load save state?
[2456.23s -> 2458.23s]  Oh my god Jeremy.
[2458.23s -> 2460.47s]  Fucking just go in the goal.
[2460.47s -> 2473.26s]  F3.
[2473.26s -> 2475.26s]  Just F1 is load. How's it?
[2475.26s -> 2485.74s]  Hey like that. Tried.
[2485.74s -> 2487.74s]  I tried. I tried. I tried. I tried.
[2487.74s -> 2490.23s]  I was going for the Super Mario skip.
[2490.23s -> 2495.74s]  Click the link. Hold on.
[2495.74s -> 2498.94s]  I'm busy. I can't just click
[2498.94s -> 2500.94s]  any link that pops up in the chat. I have to play
[2500.94s -> 2502.94s]  Super Monkey Ball HD remake.
[2502.94s -> 2506.26s]  I was speaking to HD remakes. Holy
[2506.26s -> 2508.26s]  shit. Demon's Souls looks insane.
[2508.26s -> 2512.17s]  Demon's Souls looks so
[2512.17s -> 2514.17s]  completely different that
[2514.17s -> 2516.17s]  it's like it's going to be
[2516.17s -> 2520.01s]  like playing a whole new video game.
[2520.01s -> 2522.01s]  Even though I've already played through it within the last
[2522.01s -> 2524.01s]  couple of years. What? Last two or three years or so.
[2524.01s -> 2526.01s]  It don't matter.
[2526.01s -> 2528.63s]  It's going to be like Dark Souls 4.
[2528.63s -> 2538.28s]  I really thought I was going to get that one.
[2538.28s -> 2541.22s]  Yeah. This game is fun as hell.
[2541.22s -> 2543.22s]  I'll click the link. Hold on. Just give me a second.
[2543.22s -> 2552.10s]  What is it? The Chuck E. Cheese
[2552.10s -> 2557.99s]  thing. Yeah. I saw this.
[2557.99s -> 2559.99s]  Charles Entertainment Cheese.
[2559.99s -> 2566.65s]  But it's not. Where is it?
[2566.65s -> 2574.50s]  It's kind of scary.
[2574.50s -> 2577.77s]  It's huge.
[2577.77s -> 2585.26s]  It's too big.
[2585.26s -> 2591.46s]  Oh. Go smaller.
[2591.46s -> 2595.43s]  There we are.
[2595.43s -> 2602.22s]  Chucks VFF.
[2602.22s -> 2607.34s]  Too big. Too big.
[2607.34s -> 2609.34s]  That's pretty cool. Yeah.
[2609.34s -> 2611.34s]  That's a cool image that somebody
[2611.34s -> 2613.51s]  has made of me. That's not
[2613.51s -> 2618.95s]  me.
[2618.95s -> 2620.95s]  You know that guy Dave we
[2620.95s -> 2622.95s]  talked about? The powerful senator from fucking
[2622.95s -> 2624.95s]  I don't know. Whatever state.
[2624.95s -> 2626.95s]  He also said that he was having like graphical problems
[2626.95s -> 2628.95s]  in his game.
[2628.95s -> 2630.95s]  He's texting me right now.
[2630.95s -> 2632.95s]  He's spamming me. And he's saying hey
[2632.95s -> 2634.95s]  what the fuck dude. I started
[2634.95s -> 2636.95s]  saving my state but then my graphics are all messed up.
[2636.95s -> 2638.95s]  Fix it or your stream is over.
[2638.95s -> 2642.28s]  I was like dude
[2642.28s -> 2644.28s]  I'm working on it.
[2644.28s -> 2646.28s]  So what should I do if that happens to Dave's computer?
[2646.28s -> 2655.82s]  Tell him to stop breaking
[2655.82s -> 2657.82s]  the law.
[2657.82s -> 2659.82s]  Hey fellas.
[2659.82s -> 2661.82s]  This guy
[2661.82s -> 2663.82s]  wanted me to tell a senator
[2663.82s -> 2665.82s]  to stop breaking or bending the law.
[2665.82s -> 2667.99s]  Can you believe
[2667.99s -> 2681.50s]  this guy? I hate
[2681.50s -> 2686.28s]  these ones. I hate these ones.
[2686.28s -> 2690.25s]  These ones are too hard for me. This is on advanced.
[2690.25s -> 2694.09s]  I think I can still pull it off.
[2694.09s -> 2696.09s]  Well hold on. Let me see. What's going on with my voice?
[2696.09s -> 2699.93s]  Why am I turning into this?
[2699.93s -> 2701.93s]  I don't know why I'm like this now.
[2701.93s -> 2705.96s]  I'm just going to beat the level because I don't care.
[2705.96s -> 2709.59s]  Fuck the bananas. Fuck the
[2709.59s -> 2711.59s]  bananas. Nobody cares about bananas anyways.
[2711.59s -> 2713.59s]  They're radioactive don't you know?
[2723.70s -> 2726.01s]  This is water. Okay that's going to hurt my head if I continue
[2726.01s -> 2731.51s]  to look at that. Hey
[2731.51s -> 2733.51s]  we're getting text.
[2733.51s -> 2738.31s]  Hey Jeremy I got
[2738.31s -> 2740.31s]  really, my aspect ratio
[2740.31s -> 2742.31s]  in Swordfish
[2742.31s -> 2744.31s]  1-2 is going
[2744.31s -> 2746.74s]  crazy. Fix it.
[2746.74s -> 2748.74s]  Okay I think force 4 by 3.
[2748.74s -> 2750.74s]  I think that will help if you do, if you open up that program.
[2750.74s -> 2752.74s]  Alright I'll try.
[2752.74s -> 2760.10s]  You little fuck.
[2760.10s -> 2762.10s]  I think I'm just at this guy's mercy every day?
[2762.10s -> 2766.89s]  Jeremy, is it
[2766.89s -> 2769.19s]  still safe to drink almond
[2769.19s -> 2771.19s]  milk if it's two days after it's expiration?
[2771.19s -> 2773.19s]  You better fucking tell me.
[2773.19s -> 2779.64s]  How do I end? Oh it's
[2779.64s -> 2790.06s]  okay. I'm just like
[2790.06s -> 2795.43s]  yeah
[2795.43s -> 2797.67s]  we're
[2797.67s -> 2800.55s]  unstoppable now. Oh
[2800.55s -> 2810.73s]  fuck this level. What is this
[2810.73s -> 2812.73s]  point 1, point 2, point 4?
[2812.73s -> 2815.74s]  Point 4.
[2815.74s -> 2818.42s]  Just hold forward. Oh
[2818.42s -> 2822.58s]  that didn't work. That's the thickness?
[2822.58s -> 2825.53s]  Oh let's go with the fucking
[2825.53s -> 2830.01s]  hardest one there is.
[2830.01s -> 2832.01s]  You get more bananas. Oh sick.
[2832.01s -> 2834.01s]  It's going to even get
[2834.01s -> 2841.99s]  I failed the test.
[2841.99s -> 2843.99s]  This is fun. Okay I like this. I'm going to stay here
[2843.99s -> 2845.99s]  for a little bit. Line it up.
[2845.99s -> 2852.33s]  It's impossible. It's not possible.
[2852.33s -> 2860.63s]  You have to go fast.
[2860.63s -> 2868.57s]  How would you go fast over this? Really?
[2868.57s -> 2872.66s]  I have to go fast? No.
[2872.66s -> 2885.34s]  I can't do it.
[2885.34s -> 2887.34s]  I don't think it's possible. I don't think it's possible to do this.
[2887.34s -> 2889.51s]  I also have to go straight.
[2889.51s -> 2892.33s]  Yeah I also have to go
[2892.33s -> 2894.33s]  straight. That's right. You're right.
[2894.33s -> 2899.37s]  Just balance.
[2899.37s -> 2901.37s]  Pepe laugh. I can't. I need
[2901.37s -> 2905.21s]  the upgrade. Just go forward.
[2905.21s -> 2910.14s]  Look at all those bananas too.
[2910.14s -> 2922.94s]  This is awesome. What the fuck
[2922.94s -> 2938.62s]  is going on? Just do the easy
[2938.62s -> 2940.62s]  one. I'll do point one.
[2940.62s -> 2944.14s]  You can't even go on them.
[2944.14s -> 2946.14s]  They're covered in oil.
[2946.14s -> 2955.29s]  Just do the easiest one.
[2955.29s -> 2957.29s]  No I can't do blue.
[2957.29s -> 2963.05s]  I'll do green. I'm never going to
[2963.05s -> 2965.05s]  get out of this. I'm never going to be able to do this.
[2965.05s -> 2976.82s]  I won't be able to.
[2976.82s -> 2979.45s]  Alright I'll do teal. That's my German 985
[2979.45s -> 2985.02s]  colors. That's fine.
[2985.02s -> 2988.41s]  What? Wait wait wait wait.
[2988.41s -> 2990.41s]  Is this the end?
[2990.41s -> 2996.79s]  Shit. Game over.
[2996.79s -> 3000.38s]  What do you mean game over?
[3000.38s -> 3021.43s]  Save state. No.
[3021.43s -> 3023.86s]  Save state. Give me a fucking break guys.
[3023.86s -> 3025.86s]  You think I'm some kind of asshole?
[3025.86s -> 3027.86s]  No I have six game cubes lined up here.
[3027.86s -> 3030.17s]  All at the same level.
[3030.17s -> 3032.17s]  Lined up in different parts of the game in case
[3032.17s -> 3034.79s]  I get stuck. I have
[3034.79s -> 3036.79s]  physical hardware save states.
[3036.79s -> 3051.75s]  Is that okay?
[3051.75s -> 3054.44s]  Don't fall off the easiest one.
[3054.44s -> 3058.28s]  Okay good. Blue.
[3058.28s -> 3060.28s]  LL. Fuck you're right. I'm going to do it right.
[3060.28s -> 3069.88s]  Oh my god I can't even.
[3069.88s -> 3074.10s]  What the hell is going on?
[3074.10s -> 3077.24s]  Fell off. I didn't fall off the easiest one.
[3077.24s -> 3079.24s]  I deliberately fell off the easiest one.
[3079.24s -> 3081.67s]  My fingers are like sweating and cold and shit.
[3081.67s -> 3089.29s]  My hands are sweating
[3089.29s -> 3093.83s]  and cold.
[3093.83s -> 3095.83s]  How? Why does that happen to me?
[3095.83s -> 3099.22s]  How can you be sweating and cold
[3099.22s -> 3101.22s]  on your fucking hands?
[3101.22s -> 3105.51s]  Rage already. No. Why would I?
[3105.51s -> 3107.51s]  I mean
[3107.51s -> 3109.51s]  of course I'm getting a little frustrating
[3109.51s -> 3113.22s]  to play.
[3113.22s -> 3115.22s]  I didn't do the easiest one.
[3115.22s -> 3125.70s]  That's all I care about.
[3125.70s -> 3132.54s]  Oh look at this one.
[3132.54s -> 3134.54s]  Don't forget the hardware save state.
[3134.54s -> 3139.27s]  Oh this is awesome. I love this one.
[3139.27s -> 3144.14s]  It's not even hard. It's
[3144.14s -> 3159.67s]  fun. Come on dude.
[3159.67s -> 3161.67s]  Multiple Dave states.
[3161.67s -> 3165.32s]  Senator Dave state.
[3165.32s -> 3167.32s]  Senator Dave state.
[3167.32s -> 3174.87s]  He's a statesman. Holy shit. Okay.
[3174.87s -> 3184.09s]  Game sucks. Game sucks.
[3184.09s -> 3199.90s]  Game sucks.
[3199.90s -> 3201.90s]  Hates the game. No actually I really like it.
[3207.46s -> 3209.46s]  Imagine how much of a pain in the ass that would be.
[3209.46s -> 3211.46s]  You'd have to plug in different audio video cables
[3211.46s -> 3213.46s]  and a different HDMI source.
[3213.46s -> 3218.14s]  Here we go.
[3218.14s -> 3227.91s]  Oh there was one over there at the end.
[3227.91s -> 3229.91s]  What was halfway through advanced?
[3229.91s -> 3245.19s]  Do these move?
[3245.19s -> 3251.72s]  How do you not get that banana?
[3251.72s -> 3254.54s]  Dave states Davegate.
[3254.54s -> 3258.95s]  Davegate. I understand how this
[3258.95s -> 3260.95s]  works but my brain is having trouble still.
[3260.95s -> 3265.75s]  It's going with the moving
[3265.75s -> 3267.75s]  of the game board.
[3267.75s -> 3269.75s]  I don't care. Go in.
[3269.75s -> 3277.24s]  That time bonus is
[3277.24s -> 3284.84s]  trending.
[3284.84s -> 3286.84s]  Do you think I have that much influence that I could get something trending on Twitter?
[3286.84s -> 3290.60s]  No.
[3290.60s -> 3292.60s]  It would take like
[3292.60s -> 3294.60s]  50 times the amount of people that are here.
[3294.60s -> 3298.57s]  Why can I not do this?
[3298.57s -> 3303.24s]  Why the hell would I want that?
[3303.24s -> 3305.24s]  Why would I want that to be the thing that trends?
[3305.24s -> 3309.98s]  Hold on.
[3309.98s -> 3314.25s]  Let me just plug
[3314.25s -> 3318.15s]  in my other
[3318.15s -> 3320.15s]  gamecube number four here.
[3320.15s -> 3323.29s]  Get it plugged in
[3323.29s -> 3327.90s]  and turned on.
[3327.90s -> 3331.10s]  Davecube.
[3331.10s -> 3333.10s]  Senator from
[3333.10s -> 3335.10s]  Miami please step forward.
[3335.10s -> 3337.10s]  Yes, it's me.
[3337.10s -> 3339.10s]  Dave. I'd like to introduce
[3339.10s -> 3341.10s]  Bill number
[3341.10s -> 3343.10s]  S2101 to rename
[3343.10s -> 3345.10s]  the gamecube, Davecube.
[3345.10s -> 3347.46s]  I find this to be incredibly
[3347.46s -> 3349.46s]  important to our country's security and to
[3349.46s -> 3351.46s]  my ego.
[3351.46s -> 3353.46s]  I'm looking at you over there right now.
[3353.46s -> 3359.74s]  I just realized something. We're like up in space.
[3359.74s -> 3361.74s]  We're looking down. That's kind of insane.
[3361.74s -> 3365.58s]  Can the
[3365.58s -> 3367.58s]  Senator from Miami please step forward?
[3367.58s -> 3369.58s]  Yeah.
[3369.58s -> 3373.03s]  I think it's pretentious that I
[3373.03s -> 3375.03s]  put forward Bill
[3375.03s -> 3377.03s]  S2101 to
[3377.03s -> 3379.40s]  rename Dark Souls
[3379.40s -> 3381.40s]  to Dave Souls.
[3381.40s -> 3386.39s]  It might as well be this stupid shit.
[3386.39s -> 3392.34s]  I'll be honest with you.
[3392.34s -> 3394.34s]  If that was on C-SPAN today, I probably
[3394.34s -> 3410.47s]  really wouldn't be surprised.
[3410.47s -> 3412.47s]  I'm so not good at this.
[3412.47s -> 3414.97s]  These curves are tricky as hell.
[3414.97s -> 3416.97s]  I've said that two or three times
[3416.97s -> 3418.97s]  today already. Oh, this is like
[3418.97s -> 3422.36s]  fun as hell. Why am I doing that?
[3422.36s -> 3424.36s]  Is the level moving on its own?
[3424.36s -> 3426.36s]  This is fucking hard.
[3426.36s -> 3432.12s]  Why did I think that was going to work?
[3432.12s -> 3447.67s]  Dave State.
[3447.67s -> 3449.67s]  Those of you that are joining us,
[3449.67s -> 3451.67s]  you have to understand. Do you think
[3451.67s -> 3453.67s]  that I was going to be able to play
[3453.67s -> 3455.91s]  through this game
[3455.91s -> 3457.91s]  and get to this point
[3457.91s -> 3459.91s]  like 50
[3459.91s -> 3463.11s]  times?
[3463.11s -> 3465.11s]  Do you think that was going to happen?
[3465.11s -> 3467.74s]  We're already here 50
[3467.74s -> 3476.25s]  times.
[3476.25s -> 3479.77s]  Please stop pretending
[3479.77s -> 3481.77s]  I'm banning you for life.
[3481.77s -> 3486.50s]  You completed The Simpsons without
[3486.50s -> 3488.50s]  save states. Because I didn't know they
[3488.50s -> 3494.26s]  existed. I mean, I knew
[3494.26s -> 3496.26s]  they existed. I knew they
[3496.26s -> 3499.21s]  existed. But I wasn't
[3499.21s -> 3501.21s]  using them. Oh my fucking god.
[3501.21s -> 3506.78s]  I didn't know. I knew what they were.
[3506.78s -> 3508.78s]  Hold on. Let me just take a quick sip of something.
[3508.78s -> 3515.75s]  Okay.
[3515.75s -> 3535.32s]  God damn it.
[3538.01s -> 3548.81s]  I was out of the GameCube.
[3548.81s -> 3550.81s]  Just fucking out of the GameCube really quick.
[3550.81s -> 3553.69s]  Oh, wow.
[3553.69s -> 3555.69s]  That was cool. GameCube
[3555.69s -> 3557.69s]  number five. How many
[3557.69s -> 3562.81s]  GameCubes is it going to take?
[3562.81s -> 3569.40s]  I suck at this.
[3569.40s -> 3572.92s]  Your room would be so hot right now.
[3572.92s -> 3574.92s]  You got like 30
[3574.92s -> 3576.92s]  GameCubes all plugged in, all running,
[3576.92s -> 3578.92s]  all spinning, and all making disc noises.
[3578.92s -> 3583.78s]  Can you imagine hearing
[3583.78s -> 3585.78s]  that typical like
[3585.78s -> 3587.78s]  I am
[3587.78s -> 3592.46s]  people that think I'm going to
[3592.46s -> 3594.46s]  stoop to save stating
[3594.46s -> 3596.46s]  in the middle of a level.
[3596.46s -> 3598.46s]  That's not going to happen here.
[3598.46s -> 3600.46s]  I have to beat it at least
[3600.46s -> 3605.06s]  on my own. Man.
[3605.06s -> 3607.06s]  That's so fucking weird.
[3607.06s -> 3614.30s]  It just rips you to the side.
[3614.30s -> 3621.46s]  I'm not getting any.
[3621.46s -> 3625.61s]  What the fuck?
[3625.61s -> 3627.61s]  I'm pulling as hard as I can
[3627.61s -> 3633.56s]  to the right.
[3633.56s -> 3635.56s]  What the fuck is this?
[3635.56s -> 3637.56s]  What the hell, man? That's actually
[3637.56s -> 3640.82s]  infuriating.
[3640.82s -> 3642.82s]  I'm rolling as far
[3642.82s -> 3657.42s]  to the left and right as I can.
[3657.42s -> 3659.59s]  I'm about to freak out.
[3665.35s -> 3667.35s]  Somebody just put my finger
[3667.35s -> 3669.35s]  in my belly button and moved it around.
[3669.35s -> 3671.35s]  That's what it feels like
[3671.35s -> 3673.66s]  if I put my finger in my belly button.
[3673.66s -> 3675.66s]  I push and move it around.
[3687.10s -> 3694.38s]  It takes too much.
[3694.38s -> 3696.38s]  End the stream? No. What?
[3696.38s -> 3711.16s]  Resign. Resign.
[3711.16s -> 3719.93s]  I can't end it. No.
[3719.93s -> 3721.93s]  I'm not going to end it. I'm not going to end the stream.
[3721.93s -> 3723.93s]  Fuck.
[3723.93s -> 3725.93s]  I'm losing my mind right now.
[3725.93s -> 3727.93s]  Not because of the game. Because of the shit that I'm reading.
[3727.93s -> 3742.97s]  Oh, no, no.
[3742.97s -> 3745.59s]  Oh, no, no.
[3745.59s -> 3751.91s]  You don't understand.
[3751.91s -> 3753.91s]  I'm holding left
[3753.91s -> 3755.91s]  as hard as I can to the other side when I get up there.
[3755.91s -> 3765.32s]  I fucking hate this.
[3765.32s -> 3767.32s]  I can't even fucking do it.
[3767.32s -> 3770.71s]  Alright, I'm going to put it...
[3770.71s -> 3780.70s]  No, I can't use that.
[3780.70s -> 3782.70s]  That's an emergency break.
[3782.70s -> 3784.70s]  I'm not pulling the emergency break right now.
[3784.70s -> 3789.24s]  Got it! Oh, fuck.
[3789.24s -> 3792.38s]  No!
[3792.38s -> 3794.38s]  I can't pull the Rat Tatooie
[3794.38s -> 3796.38s]  emergency break. I can't pull it yet.
[3796.38s -> 3806.49s]  I stopped screaming. What are you, crazy?
[3806.49s -> 3817.30s]  I'm going to go as slow as
[3817.30s -> 3819.93s]  possible. Fuck, it just rips
[3819.93s -> 3824.66s]  you down. No, my God!
[3824.66s -> 3826.66s]  I'm not pretending. I'm not.
[3826.66s -> 3828.66s]  I swear to God.
[3828.66s -> 3830.66s]  Okay, stop. I'm going to relax.
[3830.66s -> 3847.11s]  I'm not...
[3847.11s -> 3849.11s]  Imagine having to be really self-conscious
[3849.11s -> 3851.11s]  about the fact that you promised to people
[3851.11s -> 3853.11s]  you're not pretending to lose
[3853.11s -> 3872.38s]  at a GameCube game. Fuck you!
[3872.38s -> 3875.70s]  Fuck you! Stop!
[3875.70s -> 3880.12s]  Stop! I didn't even do anything!
[3880.12s -> 3882.74s]  Pull back!
[3882.74s -> 3885.05s]  I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything.
[3885.05s -> 3887.99s]  I didn't even do anything. I was going
[3887.99s -> 3901.30s]  so slow. Yes, your
[3901.30s -> 3903.30s]  problem. No, if I go fast, it just throws
[3903.30s -> 3905.30s]  me right off.
[3905.30s -> 3916.06s]  Dude, I'm holding it as
[3916.06s -> 3918.06s]  tight as I can to the bottom.
[3918.06s -> 3920.06s]  I'm holding it as tight as I can, and I'm just
[3920.06s -> 3943.99s]  slowly falling down. Ah!
[3943.99s -> 3954.28s]  No!
[3954.28s -> 3971.56s]  Fuck! What is hard like?
[3971.56s -> 3973.56s]  What I want to know. This is advanced? What's the other...
[3973.56s -> 3978.42s]  What's the hard ones like?
[3978.42s -> 3985.72s]  Take this audio and put it over
[3985.72s -> 3987.72s]  me watching
[3987.72s -> 3989.72s]  like big moments in TV shows.
[3989.72s -> 3991.72s]  Like daytime TV shows, like soap operas.
[3991.72s -> 3997.42s]  Like when is the reveal that...
[3997.42s -> 3999.42s]  Wait! No!
[3999.42s -> 4001.42s]  I'm in the hospital and you're not the father!
[4001.42s -> 4003.42s]  No! Fuck no!
[4003.42s -> 4010.52s]  I'm just having
[4010.52s -> 4012.52s]  extreme reactions to daytime TV.
[4012.52s -> 4014.52s]  Like, settle down.
[4014.52s -> 4030.90s]  Cut that. Okay. This is where I
[4030.90s -> 4036.60s]  fuck it up every time. Stop and
[4036.60s -> 4038.60s]  fucking run!
[4038.60s -> 4041.10s]  Run up it! Oh!
[4041.10s -> 4043.10s]  Thank you!
[4043.10s -> 4045.98s]  What? God damn it.
[4045.98s -> 4054.87s]  Lore 16.
[4054.87s -> 4059.86s]  I'm not doing that one again.
[4059.86s -> 4065.16s]  Let's first try this one. What do you say?
[4065.16s -> 4070.79s]  I had it.
[4070.79s -> 4072.79s]  Imagine getting angry about silly monkeys in a ball.
[4072.79s -> 4079.37s]  Alright, dude.
[4079.37s -> 4081.86s]  I need to do it. I have to.
[4081.86s -> 4084.62s]  I don't care.
[4084.62s -> 4088.14s]  Check this link.
[4088.14s -> 4090.76s]  I need 100 bananas.
[4090.76s -> 4102.97s]  What are you guys doing?
[4102.97s -> 4104.97s]  What are you doing? What have you done?
[4104.97s -> 4109.77s]  No, it's not real.
[4109.77s -> 4111.77s]  It's not real.
[4111.77s -> 4115.10s]  It's not real.
[4115.10s -> 4117.78s]  It's not real.
[4117.78s -> 4123.03s]  But it's so stupid.
[4123.03s -> 4126.81s]  Miami Republican
[4126.81s -> 4128.81s]  Senator Dave State introduces Bill which
[4128.81s -> 4130.81s]  would rename Nintendo's GameCube to the
[4130.81s -> 4143.74s]  DaveCube.
[4143.74s -> 4145.74s]  That's so stupid. I can't even address it.
[4145.74s -> 4148.62s]  No, I'm not pulling the rat tattoo
[4148.62s -> 4158.66s]  emergency break.
[4158.66s -> 4160.66s]  This is really fucking hard.
[4160.66s -> 4163.42s]  Four and a half hours my ass.
[4163.42s -> 4165.42s]  No way this took four and a half hours for someone to beat the whole game.
[4165.42s -> 4179.82s]  The whole game?
[4179.82s -> 4181.82s]  You're just bad, OmegaLul.
[4181.82s -> 4184.63s]  Wait, that wasn't even an OmegaLul.
[4184.63s -> 4186.63s]  That was a regular lul. I increased your lul
[4186.63s -> 4197.96s]  for you.
[4197.96s -> 4202.25s]  That's not that bad.
[4202.25s -> 4204.25s]  I can't imagine people that can just scream through all these levels.
[4204.25s -> 4208.15s]  Like, holy shit, how?
[4220.17s -> 4222.17s]  Watch the speedrun. It's insane.
[4222.17s -> 4225.11s]  I can imagine. This is insane.
[4225.11s -> 4227.11s]  You suck, dude, OmegaLul. Stop.
[4227.11s -> 4230.38s]  Somebody said Conan O'Brien?
[4234.41s -> 4236.41s]  I don't understand this monkey ball thing.
[4236.41s -> 4240.63s]  I guess it's really hard.
[4240.63s -> 4245.62s]  Gaming with Conan.
[4245.62s -> 4247.62s]  Conan O'Brien level
[4247.62s -> 4249.62s]  of skill level.
[4249.62s -> 4251.86s]  That's so...
[4251.86s -> 4253.86s]  That makes me feel a certain way.
[4253.86s -> 4259.94s]  It does.
[4259.94s -> 4261.94s]  Look at this next part coming up. You shitting me.
[4261.94s -> 4268.15s]  There's no way.
[4268.15s -> 4277.48s]  There's no way I do this.
[4277.48s -> 4283.82s]  Don't tell me to fucking hurry up. I hate that.
[4290.54s -> 4303.78s]  It's too stressful.
[4303.78s -> 4305.78s]  These are easy. Just get here quickly.
[4305.78s -> 4310.07s]  This part that I fell off on.
[4310.07s -> 4312.89s]  Who cares about the 10 straight seconds
[4312.89s -> 4314.89s]  it's going to take to Conan that banana?
[4314.89s -> 4324.23s]  Goddamn it. Stripper is in the window.
[4324.23s -> 4328.26s]  What window?
[4328.26s -> 4330.26s]  I thought you were talking about my window.
[4330.26s -> 4343.06s]  That would be really weird.
[4343.06s -> 4349.58s]  He looked.
[4349.58s -> 4351.58s]  I was just trying to figure out what you were talking about.
[4351.58s -> 4358.47s]  I did look.
[4358.47s -> 4361.66s]  Now slow it down.
[4361.66s -> 4365.24s]  What are you doing?
[4365.24s -> 4367.24s]  I got 30 seconds to get through this. Just go slow.
[4367.24s -> 4381.90s]  Fucking no.
[4381.90s -> 4383.90s]  No. It's that last little turn.
[4411.02s -> 4413.02s]  Conan would have the celebrity
[4413.02s -> 4417.94s]  play this part.
[4417.94s -> 4419.94s]  If it was me, then we would
[4419.94s -> 4423.14s]  really be fucked.
[4423.14s -> 4425.14s]  So Jerma, how you doing? You having trouble with this level?
[4425.14s -> 4427.14s]  Yeah, I'm bad at the game.
[4427.14s -> 4429.14s]  Me too.
[4429.14s -> 4432.86s]  I'm sorry.
[4432.86s -> 4434.86s]  I'm supposed to be like a
[4434.86s -> 4440.94s]  streamer or something.
[4440.94s -> 4442.94s]  You're going to have to recut this whole thing and redo this whole thing.
[4442.94s -> 4444.94s]  Put a dog here or something.
[4444.94s -> 4446.94s]  I'm really sorry.
[4446.94s -> 4448.94s]  You can use that idea though.
[4448.94s -> 4450.94s]  If I get like 10% royalty from whatever
[4450.94s -> 4452.94s]  the advertising comes in that show
[4452.94s -> 4454.94s]  that day.
[4454.94s -> 4456.94s]  I'll give you the idea and set it up for you.
[4456.94s -> 4470.25s]  At least one of those bananas.
[4470.25s -> 4477.54s]  I'll be happy.
[4477.54s -> 4479.54s]  I'm starting to think you don't have a bunch of game cubes
[4479.54s -> 4482.74s]  with safe states.
[4482.74s -> 4484.74s]  Fuck no.
[4484.74s -> 4486.74s]  I can't not pay attention.
[4486.74s -> 4490.58s]  They would be
[4490.58s -> 4492.58s]  stacked up in the garage
[4492.58s -> 4497.90s]  at this point.
[4497.90s -> 4499.90s]  It would be in the bathtub
[4499.90s -> 4501.90s]  stacked.
[4501.90s -> 4503.90s]  In the toilets. In the fridge.
[4503.90s -> 4506.39s]  There would be no where to put them.
[4506.39s -> 4515.67s]  You know what I think?
[4515.67s -> 4517.67s]  Here's the other problem. I think it's the music that's doing it to me too.
[4517.67s -> 4522.02s]  Oh my god.
[4522.02s -> 4524.02s]  My fucking computer.
[4524.02s -> 4554.86s]  Yeah.
[4554.86s -> 4557.48s]  Put on a different soundtrack.
[4557.48s -> 4559.48s]  Put a different soundtrack on.
[4559.48s -> 4565.69s]  Put another soundtrack on?
[4565.69s -> 4568.12s]  Wait, is there a race? I'm racing somebody.
[4568.12s -> 4577.46s]  Yeah.
[4577.46s -> 4579.46s]  I'm not sure how much longer I can take.
[4579.46s -> 4581.46s]  Like the Sega Bass Pro Fishing soundtrack.
[4581.46s -> 4590.34s]  Why was that one hard?
[4590.34s -> 4593.80s]  Oh, this one looks elaborate.
[4593.80s -> 4600.01s]  These shortcuts, damn it.
[4600.01s -> 4606.73s]  Get out of here.
[4606.73s -> 4616.97s]  I need this.
[4616.97s -> 4618.97s]  So I don't have to save the thing that
[4618.97s -> 4620.97s]  the Senator was doing.
[4620.97s -> 4635.11s]  Stop doing that. Oh, it's irritating.
[4635.11s -> 4637.11s]  I even get irritated in the actual pinball machines
[4637.11s -> 4639.11s]  if this happens. I'm just like, stop doing that.
[4639.11s -> 4649.93s]  Shut up.
[4649.93s -> 4655.05s]  This, what's this, water level?
[4659.06s -> 4664.06s]  First try, let's go.
[4664.06s -> 4671.08s]  This one's not even that bad.
[4671.08s -> 4673.08s]  A dull submarine.
[4673.08s -> 4683.70s]  What are you? Dull.
[4683.70s -> 4697.19s]  I just wanted to get the bananas.
[4697.19s -> 4699.19s]  Insane aquarium? Oh, that's one of the greatest video games of all time.
[4699.19s -> 4702.65s]  I'm glad you agree.
[4702.65s -> 4704.65s]  Alright, so I have to stay really close and then
[4704.65s -> 4706.65s]  bang a right, right? That's kind of how this works.
[4706.65s -> 4716.94s]  Jesus.
[4716.94s -> 4719.18s]  Alright, I'm good. This one wasn't that bad.
[4719.18s -> 4724.98s]  Why do you speed run this one?
[4724.98s -> 4732.98s]  That would be very hard to do.
[4732.98s -> 4739.06s]  Bring back grandpa.
[4739.06s -> 4744.06s]  I don't know, man.
[4744.06s -> 4746.30s]  What? You don't have to go in that hole?
[4746.30s -> 4751.72s]  Where's the goal?
[4751.72s -> 4753.72s]  Oh, it's over there. Oh, shit, okay.
[4753.72s -> 4760.50s]  Bring him back from hell.
[4760.50s -> 4765.67s]  I don't really want to.
[4765.67s -> 4767.67s]  Oh, shit, that's going to be fucking hard.
[4767.67s -> 4776.31s]  I already know it. Bring back Bugleberry.
[4776.31s -> 4778.68s]  You will see him again.
[4778.68s -> 4781.30s]  Don't worry. Just at least get the
[4781.30s -> 4785.32s]  big one up here.
[4785.32s -> 4787.32s]  At least. Okay, go. I don't care.
[4787.32s -> 4795.70s]  Oh, boy, this one.
[4795.70s -> 4799.99s]  Halloween Bugleberry
[4799.99s -> 4803.51s]  stream?
[4803.51s -> 4807.67s]  Maybe. I don't think anyone that's
[4807.67s -> 4809.67s]  ever played this game has ever fallen through that one.
[4809.67s -> 4811.67s]  I don't think so.
[4811.67s -> 4813.67s]  I think I might be the first one.
[4813.67s -> 4823.21s]  I'm going to hug the left side.
[4823.21s -> 4825.45s]  Uh,
[4825.45s -> 4828.07s]  what's the map? Do I get the bananas?
[4828.07s -> 4831.96s]  I'm running out of time.
[4831.96s -> 4834.65s]  How do I get those?
[4834.65s -> 4836.65s]  Hold on, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[4836.65s -> 4839.53s]  Do the mandatory
[4839.53s -> 4841.53s]  ego boost stream when Bugleberry's on.
[4841.53s -> 4843.53s]  That's a fucking brilliant idea.
[4843.53s -> 4851.91s]  Fuck the bananas.
[4851.91s -> 4857.29s]  I want them.
[4857.29s -> 4859.29s]  I want it.
[4859.29s -> 4865.24s]  Oh, my God, this one. I don't like this. I hate this one.
[4865.24s -> 4868.82s]  Are you going to play Saw again? Yeah, I'm going to play Saw.
[4868.82s -> 4870.82s]  I'm going to finish Saw 1.
[4870.82s -> 4872.82s]  And then go to Saw 2.
[4872.82s -> 4880.63s]  Probably on the same day.
[4880.63s -> 4883.90s]  Get a bunch of speed running this thing. Just do it.
[4883.90s -> 4887.10s]  And now, what?
[4887.10s -> 4891.45s]  Go down?
[4891.45s -> 4898.98s]  Is this on a slant?
[4898.98s -> 4902.25s]  No, this is good.
[4902.25s -> 4904.74s]  Oh, I could have got those bananas over there.
[4904.74s -> 4909.99s]  Shit.
[4909.99s -> 4911.99s]  Oh, my God, click the funny link, Germo.
[4911.99s -> 4915.38s]  Uh, I'm not clicking any links.
[4915.38s -> 4924.86s]  Can you play Hylix?
[4924.86s -> 4926.86s]  I actually have that now.
[4926.86s -> 4935.16s]  I bought that a while ago.
[4935.16s -> 4940.47s]  Holy shit, this one's insane.
[4940.47s -> 4942.47s]  I only missed a banana. Yeah.
[4942.47s -> 4944.47s]  I'm fine.
[4944.47s -> 4950.42s]  I'll be good. Hylix OST
[4950.42s -> 4953.30s]  fucks.
[4953.30s -> 4957.85s]  Dude, how would you do this without
[4957.85s -> 4969.62s]  Oh, my God, don't
[4969.62s -> 4971.62s]  just forget about the bananas and just do it.
[4971.62s -> 4974.18s]  Do it. Just go.
[4974.18s -> 4977.58s]  Oh, by the way, let me just
[4977.58s -> 4979.58s]  make a comment on this.
[4979.58s -> 4981.58s]  This is not a Mario slide
[4981.58s -> 4983.75s]  game. The reason why
[4983.75s -> 4985.75s]  I decided to play this is because I was like, man,
[4985.75s -> 4987.75s]  I wish there was a game where it was only Mario slides.
[4987.75s -> 4989.75s]  This is not it.
[4989.75s -> 5014.89s]  Super Mario.
[5014.89s -> 5018.09s]  Wait, I might just be making
[5018.09s -> 5020.09s]  this up and somebody probably just didn't even say this, but
[5020.09s -> 5022.09s]  did somebody just say that there
[5022.09s -> 5024.09s]  was a Mario 64 ROM hack
[5024.09s -> 5026.09s]  with all slides?
[5026.09s -> 5028.33s]  Did I make that up?
[5028.33s -> 5030.33s]  Did I, like, take somebody's words and just
[5030.33s -> 5035.58s]  twist them completely?
[5035.58s -> 5037.58s]  There is. No, shit. Is it really?
[5037.58s -> 5043.08s]  Oh, that's awesome.
[5043.08s -> 5052.55s]  I might have to look into that.
[5052.55s -> 5057.42s]  There are so many. I'll have to give them a try.
[5057.42s -> 5060.10s]  That sounds fun. I love
[5060.10s -> 5072.97s]  Mario slides. Don't fall
[5072.97s -> 5074.97s]  into one of the small ones. Okay.
[5074.97s -> 5076.97s]  Not too hard, not too soft, just right.
[5076.97s -> 5078.97s]  Not too hard, not too
[5078.97s -> 5080.97s]  soft, just right.
[5080.97s -> 5092.92s]  Like that. Oh, shit.
[5092.92s -> 5095.10s]  This one's crazy. Oh, man.
[5095.10s -> 5097.10s]  This one's crazy.
[5097.10s -> 5099.66s]  Good commentary on the game.
[5099.66s -> 5101.66s]  Oh, man. This one's gonna be nuts.
[5101.66s -> 5107.54s]  Oh, boy.
[5107.54s -> 5109.54s]  That's already, I can already tell this is gonna be a
[5109.54s -> 5111.78s]  this one's gonna be a hell.
[5111.78s -> 5113.78s]  I just tried to do the whole thing in one go?
[5113.78s -> 5119.42s]  No, I'm not that good. I'm not that smart.
[5119.42s -> 5124.22s]  Whatever. Just go really fast.
[5124.22s -> 5134.46s]  How's my voice not get tired?
[5134.46s -> 5137.59s]  Well, it's from years of being
[5137.59s -> 5139.77s]  classically trained to
[5139.77s -> 5141.77s]  be speaking and singing in a way.
[5141.77s -> 5143.94s]  Like, for instance, I'm
[5143.94s -> 5145.94s]  contracting my vocal cords in a way that make it so it's not
[5145.94s -> 5147.94s]  so much strain.
[5149.94s -> 5151.94s]  Like it's, I've been trained
[5151.94s -> 5163.34s]  pretty well. You're taught
[5163.34s -> 5165.34s]  during vocal school to only use about
[5165.34s -> 5167.34s]  10% of your power level in your voice?
[5169.77s -> 5182.44s]  I wasn't paying attention. I was doing
[5182.44s -> 5185.32s]  pretty good.
[5185.32s -> 5190.76s]  Oh, fuck you. What would 20%
[5190.76s -> 5195.88s]  of your power level look like?
[5195.88s -> 5197.88s]  And they make a whole TV show about that?
[5197.88s -> 5200.95s]  She's using more than
[5200.95s -> 5202.95s]  10% of her brain and she can
[5202.95s -> 5204.95s]  fold cars in half with her mind.
[5219.80s -> 5221.80s]  That's the way the lady could like look at
[5221.80s -> 5223.80s]  people and fold them into a pretzel.
[5223.80s -> 5242.62s]  I'm not gonna get this right ever.
[5242.62s -> 5255.29s]  Stop. It was called Lucy
[5255.29s -> 5259.19s]  with Scarlett Johansson.
[5259.19s -> 5269.82s]  Yeah. We're on the Conan
[5269.82s -> 5273.40s]  OST. There's no Conan
[5273.40s -> 5276.86s]  OST. They just play
[5276.86s -> 5278.86s]  Does that mean I'm going max speed?
[5278.86s -> 5286.86s]  There's no Conan OST.
[5286.86s -> 5288.86s]  Why would there be a Conan OST?
[5288.86s -> 5294.87s]  The Conan OST is just
[5294.87s -> 5296.87s]  background jazz music.
[5296.87s -> 5302.95s]  I'm looking at chat and I'm not
[5302.95s -> 5307.88s]  looking at the game. Conan OST.
[5307.88s -> 5310.44s]  Oh, okay. Well, there's
[5310.44s -> 5312.44s]  a Conan the Barbarian OST.
[5312.44s -> 5326.97s]  Hold on. Let me just
[5326.97s -> 5333.05s]  play it, play it, play it.
[5333.05s -> 5335.54s]  Why are you looking at the QRS
[5335.54s -> 5348.14s]  clip?
[5348.14s -> 5351.66s]  What a fucked up stream.
[5351.66s -> 5353.66s]  I was drunk.
[5353.66s -> 5356.28s]  Like really drunk
[5356.28s -> 5358.28s]  on that stream.
[5358.28s -> 5361.42s]  Okay, slow down. Don't go
[5361.42s -> 5363.42s]  this fast. Here it comes.
[5363.42s -> 5367.64s]  Okay, I got it.
[5367.64s -> 5370.58s]  I got it. I got it. I'm good. I'm good.
[5370.58s -> 5373.66s]  Oh, really? Yeah.
[5373.66s -> 5387.53s]  Oh, I have to go
[5387.53s -> 5392.26s]  that way.
[5392.26s -> 5397.83s]  Did I Dave State this?
[5397.83s -> 5399.83s]  Fuck. Not good. Just fall off. Who cares?
[5399.83s -> 5412.95s]  What the hell? How am I?
[5412.95s -> 5418.65s]  Everybody said what is it? Dave
[5418.65s -> 5421.59s]  State? Oh, right. You might not have been
[5421.59s -> 5424.15s]  here.
[5424.15s -> 5428.82s]  I don't know. I need to go fast.
[5428.82s -> 5430.82s]  Yeah, but I went fast last time. I overshot it, didn't I?
[5430.82s -> 5434.02s]  Oh, fuck. Okay, I got it.
[5434.02s -> 5437.67s]  Dave Cube.
[5437.67s -> 5450.58s]  I got it. Yeah, that's the
[5450.58s -> 5452.58s]  kind of speed you're looking for. Yeah, it is.
[5452.58s -> 5460.07s]  But that's not going to work out, is it?
[5480.12s -> 5487.91s]  What a fun level.
[5487.91s -> 5495.85s]  It's fun. It's fun.
[5495.85s -> 5497.85s]  Fucking god. Oh, fucking god.
[5497.85s -> 5499.85s]  Listen to me. I said like fucking cool.
[5499.85s -> 5501.85s]  Oh, my god.
[5501.85s -> 5515.78s]  Is this a Dollar Tree streamer?
[5515.78s -> 5517.78s]  I'm trying to piece together what that means.
[5517.78s -> 5519.78s]  I think what you mean by that is
[5519.78s -> 5522.60s]  that this is
[5522.60s -> 5524.60s]  so the gameplay is not
[5524.60s -> 5527.22s]  high quality or something.
[5527.22s -> 5529.22s]  It's still good enough. You still use it?
[5529.22s -> 5531.22s]  I don't know. What does that mean?
[5531.22s -> 5534.17s]  Some high quality shit at the dollar store. I don't know
[5534.17s -> 5550.36s]  what you're talking about. You look like
[5550.36s -> 5552.36s]  you came from the dollar store.
[5552.36s -> 5555.37s]  With like a bag of groceries or something?
[5555.37s -> 5557.37s]  Like, who cares?
[5557.37s -> 5560.70s]  Like, oh, I have some stuff from the dollar store.
[5560.70s -> 5562.70s]  Wow, it looks like you really came out of the dollar store.
[5562.70s -> 5564.70s]  Yeah, I came out of the dollar store and I have some stuff
[5564.70s -> 5566.70s]  in a bag. I've got like a
[5566.70s -> 5568.70s]  baseball cap on and a t-shirt. What, is there
[5568.70s -> 5583.66s]  something wrong?
[5583.66s -> 5585.66s]  This is just Fall Guys flashback to that
[5585.66s -> 5587.90s]  stupid level that I don't like.
[5587.90s -> 5590.26s]  Oh, no. Okay. Is this the final level?
[5590.26s -> 5594.55s]  Can I go over there in one go?
[5594.55s -> 5596.92s]  Can I go for it?
[5596.92s -> 5600.57s]  I can. I can. I can. I can. I can. I can. I can.
[5600.57s -> 5620.78s]  Awww.
[5620.78s -> 5635.43s]  It's not going so fucking fast.
[5635.43s -> 5637.43s]  Dollar store strat.
[5637.43s -> 5639.43s]  That's not even funny.
[5639.43s -> 5641.43s]  Where's the humor there?
[5641.43s -> 5643.80s]  What's the joke?
[5643.80s -> 5645.80s]  I don't understand. Explain the joke to me.
[5645.80s -> 5657.45s]  Why did I go that way?
[5657.45s -> 5665.13s]  I know what it means.
[5665.13s -> 5667.82s]  Oh, shit. It's Frogger.
[5667.82s -> 5683.62s]  I have to get the rope. Okay.
[5683.62s -> 5700.71s]  Oh, please. Why did I get on that?
[5700.71s -> 5706.34s]  Dude.
[5706.34s -> 5708.34s]  Imagine being like a kid with
[5708.34s -> 5710.34s]  a GameCube controller in your hand right now.
[5710.34s -> 5712.58s]  And you have your memory card plugged in
[5712.58s -> 5714.58s]  and you get to here. This is a level of like
[5714.58s -> 5716.58s]  30. And you have to do this
[5716.58s -> 5718.58s]  bullshit like this many times
[5718.58s -> 5720.58s]  before you get it right. You have to play through the game
[5720.58s -> 5724.87s]  45 times.
[5724.87s -> 5726.87s]  Four and a half my ass.
[5726.87s -> 5739.22s]  Four and a half. Did I say 45?
[5739.22s -> 5741.22s]  Yeah, four and a half my ass. Not 45
[5741.22s -> 5747.75s]  my ass. I don't have to wait for a hole in the
[5747.75s -> 5749.75s]  cycle, I think so. Wait. I can get in this one.
[5749.75s -> 5758.25s]  There it is. Nice.
[5758.25s -> 5763.42s]  That's it.
[5763.42s -> 5774.94s]  I did it. We're free.
[5774.94s -> 5782.42s]  Wait, am I falling right now out of the sky?
[5782.42s -> 5790.49s]  Now to expert. I'm gonna
[5790.49s -> 5796.62s]  I'm gonna try it. Let's turn the music off
[5796.62s -> 5803.46s]  though. Oh, the sub thing. Right.
[5803.46s -> 5813.90s]  The sub bananas. Presented by
[5813.90s -> 5818.06s]  Sega. He's going to die so much.
[5818.06s -> 5832.65s]  Okay. I don't care.
[5832.65s -> 5842.06s]  The name doesn't even matter. That was
[5842.06s -> 5844.87s]  advanced mode. We're now going to move
[5844.87s -> 5859.19s]  on to expert mode.
[5859.19s -> 5863.74s]  I'll try GonGon.
[5863.74s -> 5865.74s]  Expert. 50 stages.
[5865.74s -> 5871.75s]  This is gonna be horrible. Was there some
[5871.75s -> 5873.75s]  weird link we wanted to click on? Alright.
[5873.75s -> 5882.33s]  Fake Trump
[5882.33s -> 5884.33s]  suite.
[5884.33s -> 5889.26s]  I've just heard about DaveGate.
[5889.26s -> 5891.26s]  The American people shouldn't tolerate
[5891.26s -> 5893.26s]  this name change. From Game
[5893.26s -> 5895.75s]  Cube to DaveCube. As a gamer
[5895.75s -> 5897.93s]  myself, I will not let this
[5897.93s -> 5899.93s]  happen. Senator Dave needs to
[5899.93s -> 5901.93s]  resign immediately. Right now.
[5901.93s -> 5918.10s]  Here we go.
[5918.10s -> 5920.10s]  Biggly.
[5920.10s -> 5923.69s]  Biggly Choo.
[5923.69s -> 5934.89s]  Expert time. Nothing. Alright.
[5934.89s -> 5936.89s]  Let's get the yo.
[5936.89s -> 5938.89s]  It's not. Why are there two
[5938.89s -> 5945.93s]  goals? What's a red goal do?
[5945.93s -> 5954.50s]  Holy shit. That's a lot
[5954.50s -> 5961.86s]  of bananas. I'm gonna get
[5961.86s -> 5966.41s]  them all. I just jumped to
[5966.41s -> 5968.41s]  floor five? I just skipped the floor.
[5968.41s -> 5972.31s]  Holy shit. Okay. I've jumped.
[5972.31s -> 5985.62s]  I skipped it. I can
[5985.62s -> 5987.62s]  see how 13
[5987.62s -> 5989.62s]  or 14 year old me would have played this game.
[5989.62s -> 5991.62s]  A million times. Even if I lost
[5991.62s -> 5993.62s]  every time. I would just be
[5993.62s -> 5995.62s]  after school with like a peanut butter and fluff sandwich.
[5995.62s -> 5999.34s]  And I would get sticky fluff
[5999.34s -> 6001.34s]  hands all over the controller and I would not clean it.
[6001.34s -> 6003.83s]  It would never be cleaned. It would just
[6003.83s -> 6014.07s]  cake on there. You know
[6014.07s -> 6017.27s]  what fluff is? Oh right. Fluff is
[6017.27s -> 6019.27s]  a New England thing, isn't it?
[6019.27s -> 6022.47s]  It's like marshmallow cream.
[6022.47s -> 6025.03s]  Kraft has a wicked shitty
[6025.03s -> 6027.03s]  version called like Jet Puff.
[6027.03s -> 6029.03s]  This stuff sucks. Not the same.
[6029.03s -> 6040.55s]  Everybody has fluff?
[6040.55s -> 6049.19s]  No they don't. That was
[6049.19s -> 6051.19s]  stupid. That was stupid, Jeremy.
[6051.19s -> 6053.19s]  Why are you doing stupid things?
[6053.19s -> 6072.06s]  Uh. Uh.
[6072.06s -> 6087.67s]  Uh. Uh.
[6087.67s -> 6092.41s]  Don't you fucking crash on me.
[6092.41s -> 6102.14s]  This one sucks.
[6102.14s -> 6104.14s]  I haven't even played it yet. Can I skip?
[6104.14s -> 6109.70s]  We have fluff in the south. We call it
[6109.70s -> 6111.70s]  peanut butter and fluff. Fluffernutter. Yeah.
[6111.70s -> 6113.70s]  Me too.
[6113.70s -> 6117.61s]  A lot of places don't have it though.
[6117.61s -> 6128.66s]  That's hard. Why continue?
[6128.66s -> 6130.66s]  We already have infinite continues.
[6130.66s -> 6137.90s]  You're never going to beat this by the way.
[6137.90s -> 6139.90s]  Hold on. You say I'm
[6139.90s -> 6148.73s]  never going to beat this.
[6148.73s -> 6150.97s]  Never. The answer
[6150.97s -> 6154.30s]  the answer is never.
[6154.30s -> 6156.30s]  Shit that was so fast.
[6156.30s -> 6160.52s]  Never. Ever.
[6160.52s -> 6178.50s]  Not ever. Oh man.
[6178.50s -> 6188.87s]  You're too old.
[6188.87s -> 6192.46s]  Well. Hey.
[6192.46s -> 6194.46s]  How about this. I'll tell you when I'm going
[6194.46s -> 6196.46s]  to give up. Not the other way around.
[6196.46s -> 6205.03s]  Vod Watcher is skip.
[6205.03s -> 6208.74s]  Well that's the beauty of being a Vod
[6208.74s -> 6210.74s]  Watcher. You can watch
[6210.74s -> 6212.74s]  every portion of the stream you want. You can rewind
[6212.74s -> 6214.74s]  this ten times. And watch
[6214.74s -> 6216.74s]  me do this right now.
[6216.74s -> 6231.90s]  Fucking God. You didn't.
[6231.90s -> 6233.90s]  Okay. I was misled.
[6233.90s -> 6236.84s]  German Monkey Ball is like a Mario
[6236.84s -> 6238.84s]  slide game. No, no, no. It's a balancing beam
[6238.84s -> 6240.84s]  game. Very different.
[6240.84s -> 6242.84s]  And very much not in my wheelhouse.
[6242.84s -> 6256.47s]  Alright. Easy.
[6256.47s -> 6262.92s]  Okay. Oh.
[6262.92s -> 6264.92s]  Yuck. Yuck.
[6264.92s -> 6266.92s]  Balancing beam bullshit.
[6266.92s -> 6269.35s]  It's not a Mario slide game.
[6269.35s -> 6282.73s]  It's a balancing beam game.
[6282.73s -> 6284.73s]  Oh. I'm sorry. That hurt.
[6284.73s -> 6289.02s]  You're playing the wrong one.
[6289.02s -> 6292.66s]  How could they be a right monkey. Aren't they all fun
[6292.66s -> 6294.66s]  and all like this?
[6294.66s -> 6297.86s]  Although, wait. There probably is one
[6297.86s -> 6299.86s]  Super Monkey Ball party game.
[6299.86s -> 6302.30s]  Where it's just like Mario Party but it's
[6302.30s -> 6307.03s]  Monkey Ball. Okay.
[6307.03s -> 6309.03s]  Go fast maybe? Just run.
[6309.03s -> 6311.03s]  Am I going to fall through that?
[6311.03s -> 6314.94s]  I'm going to try to go very fast.
[6314.94s -> 6320.89s]  Holy shit. It worked. Boy.
[6320.89s -> 6327.93s]  My God. This is so hard.
[6327.93s -> 6329.93s]  No way.
[6329.93s -> 6331.93s]  Dude.
[6331.93s -> 6333.93s]  No way.
[6333.93s -> 6341.74s]  Not a chance.
[6341.74s -> 6343.74s]  In hell. That's so hard.
[6343.74s -> 6349.69s]  That's so stressful.
[6349.69s -> 6351.69s]  Somebody said there's like
[6351.69s -> 6353.69s]  one slide.
[6353.69s -> 6359.05s]  Why did it work the first
[6359.05s -> 6368.76s]  time?
[6368.76s -> 6370.76s]  Stop.
[6370.76s -> 6372.76s]  He's never ever ever going to win.
[6372.76s -> 6378.78s]  Okay. Settle down.
[6378.78s -> 6390.74s]  I'm fine. Okay. I'm at that point
[6390.74s -> 6392.74s]  in this room where I can feel like
[6392.74s -> 6394.74s]  the criticism. I can
[6394.74s -> 6396.74s]  hear it. I can feel it. It's like
[6396.74s -> 6398.74s]  in my nose. It's itching.
[6398.74s -> 6400.74s]  I can hear what you're saying.
[6400.74s -> 6409.51s]  Why did it work the first
[6409.51s -> 6411.51s]  time? Why did it work the first time?
[6411.51s -> 6418.74s]  Why did it work the first time?
[6418.74s -> 6428.09s]  Thank God I have infinite lives.
[6428.09s -> 6432.25s]  Right now, my
[6432.25s -> 6434.25s]  pants are sagging down to
[6434.25s -> 6436.42s]  my ankles. At the arcade.
[6436.42s -> 6438.42s]  Because they're just so, there's like
[6438.42s -> 6440.42s]  12 pounds of coins.
[6440.42s -> 6442.42s]  In both pockets.
[6442.42s -> 6457.40s]  I have infinite coins.
[6457.40s -> 6481.26s]  Let's
[6481.26s -> 6486.63s]  go to the arcade
[6486.63s -> 6488.63s]  with a diaper on. Full of coins.
[6488.63s -> 6492.79s]  Okay. Is the diaper on
[6492.79s -> 6494.79s]  over your jeans?
[6494.79s -> 6497.74s]  Because that would be okay.
[6497.74s -> 6505.93s]  Wouldn't it? If you had
[6505.93s -> 6507.93s]  a pair of jeans, like you had underwear
[6507.93s -> 6509.93s]  pants, like a pair of jeans on, and then you had
[6509.93s -> 6511.93s]  a diaper on over it. And that's what you
[6511.93s -> 6516.60s]  filled with tokens.
[6516.60s -> 6518.60s]  Is that okay? Like what's
[6518.60s -> 6521.99s]  wrong with that? Stop
[6521.99s -> 6523.99s]  you motherfucker. I swear to God.
[6523.99s -> 6535.50s]  What do you mean worse?
[6535.50s -> 6537.50s]  Hold on, you said you would get arrested
[6537.50s -> 6539.50s]  for doing the Doug funny?
[6539.50s -> 6541.50s]  That's, you'd get arrested.
[6541.50s -> 6545.53s]  Okay, so if I like brought a
[6545.53s -> 6547.53s]  diaper into a store and held it in my hand,
[6547.53s -> 6549.53s]  and I was like fully closed,
[6549.53s -> 6553.62s]  I would get arrested.
[6553.62s -> 6555.62s]  Why are diapers illegal
[6555.62s -> 6568.62s]  to own? Okay.
[6568.62s -> 6570.62s]  I'm starting to believe that they're, I'm starting
[6570.62s -> 6572.62s]  to believe the people when they say that I'm never going to beat it.
[6572.62s -> 6589.56s]  I almost, okay. Should I
[6589.56s -> 6591.56s]  slow it down here? Okay, I've failed this
[6591.56s -> 6593.93s]  over and over and over again by trying
[6593.93s -> 6595.93s]  to run past it as fast as I can.
[6595.93s -> 6598.23s]  So I'm just going to do it
[6598.23s -> 6600.23s]  the way that I think I should be doing it.
[6600.23s -> 6623.32s]  Oh my God.
[6623.32s -> 6625.32s]  You don't have the time to do that.
[6625.32s -> 6628.01s]  That's probably true. Probably right.
[6628.01s -> 6636.46s]  Seven out of fifty.
[6636.46s -> 6638.63s]  Yeah, but look,
[6638.63s -> 6640.63s]  this is one of the hard ones. This is the gear check.
[6640.63s -> 6642.81s]  If I can get past this
[6642.81s -> 6644.81s]  one, then I'll just skip to like level twelve eventually
[6644.81s -> 6648.71s]  with one of those skippers.
[6648.71s -> 6654.73s]  Okay, here we go.
[6654.73s -> 6656.73s]  I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it.
[6656.73s -> 6659.16s]  I'm going to save state there. I don't care.
[6659.16s -> 6667.42s]  I'm going to save state right there.
[6667.42s -> 6669.42s]  No, no, no, no, no. Yes.
[6669.42s -> 6679.45s]  Yes.
[6679.45s -> 6702.09s]  I got it this time.
[6702.09s -> 6704.09s]  Somebody just said, oh, yo, dude, I came into the stream.
[6704.09s -> 6706.09s]  You're playing this on the DaveCube, right?
[6706.09s -> 6710.76s]  Yeah, that bill passed.
[6710.76s -> 6712.76s]  It turns out nobody actually gives a shit if that's
[6712.76s -> 6718.33s]  changed or not.
[6718.33s -> 6720.33s]  This console hasn't been relevant in twenty years.
[6720.33s -> 6737.10s]  No one cares.
[6737.10s -> 6742.92s]  No, please.
[6742.92s -> 6753.80s]  Why?
[6753.80s -> 6755.80s]  I'm one of those people in like the shooting games
[6755.80s -> 6757.80s]  that pop up that they go, don't shoot
[6757.80s -> 6788.97s]  me.
[6788.97s -> 6790.97s]  I'm going to get real angry here in a minute.
[6790.97s -> 6793.59s]  I'm going to save state there.
[6793.59s -> 6795.59s]  Use the baby. Why?
[6795.59s -> 6800.84s]  Baby smaller?
[6800.84s -> 6803.72s]  Wait, is that real? Am I making this
[6803.72s -> 6807.18s]  harder for no reason? Am I?
[6807.18s -> 6811.53s]  I can't change characters in the middle of this.
[6811.53s -> 6824.71s]  Fucking my god.
[6824.71s -> 6826.71s]  What am I going to do here?
[6826.71s -> 6828.71s]  I have to get out of this. I have to get out of this level.
[6828.71s -> 6842.14s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[6842.14s -> 6844.14s]  You can't do this to me. You can't just
[6844.14s -> 6865.38s]  fuck up and. God damn it, Dave.
[6865.38s -> 6869.35s]  God damn it, Dave.
[6869.35s -> 6875.50s]  Why?
[6875.50s -> 6886.57s]  It's the fucking music.
[6886.57s -> 6893.54s]  I got to turn the music off. It's the music.
[6893.54s -> 6911.91s]  The music's going off. No!
[6911.91s -> 6913.91s]  That's not good.
[6913.91s -> 6931.83s]  Put it into mono? I'm not going to put it into
[6931.83s -> 6946.79s]  mono. Okay.
[6946.79s -> 6953.18s]  No, I don't want to just do
[6953.18s -> 6955.18s]  this.
[6959.18s -> 6962.12s]  What is this?
[6962.12s -> 6986.10s]  I don't care.
[6986.10s -> 6988.41s]  I really don't even care.
[6988.41s -> 6990.41s]  You could scream in my face if you
[6990.41s -> 6992.41s]  want. You could grab me and pull me and
[6992.41s -> 6999.51s]  scream in my face.
[6999.51s -> 7012.12s]  I'm not even going to need it.
[7012.12s -> 7031.64s]  My hands are so
[7031.64s -> 7033.82s]  greasy.
[7033.82s -> 7046.23s]  My hands, it's unbelievable.
[7046.23s -> 7048.23s]  Oh my fucking god, what am I doing? Stop, stop, okay.
[7048.23s -> 7079.51s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[7079.51s -> 7088.41s]  Eventually.
[7088.41s -> 7103.05s]  Oh shit.
[7103.05s -> 7105.05s]  I ran out of disc space
[7105.05s -> 7123.67s]  for the save states.
[7123.67s -> 7125.91s]  Don't do that.
[7125.91s -> 7127.91s]  Okay, don't be a fucking idiot, man.
[7127.91s -> 7129.91s]  I almost just save stated while I was going
[7129.91s -> 7140.54s]  down.
[7140.54s -> 7142.54s]  I have to use one hand.
[7142.54s -> 7144.78s]  I have to use one hand.
[7144.78s -> 7148.36s]  Ow, my chest.
[7150.92s -> 7159.56s]  I can't.
[7159.56s -> 7161.56s]  Oh, the time.
[7161.56s -> 7163.56s]  There's no time.
[7163.56s -> 7171.88s]  What?
[7171.88s -> 7182.12s]  Get it.
[7205.06s -> 7213.19s]  Fuck.
[7213.19s -> 7219.08s]  That one was fine.
[7243.96s -> 7252.54s]  How can you imagine
[7252.54s -> 7255.67s]  how, think about all the
[7255.67s -> 7257.67s]  times to start over
[7257.67s -> 7259.67s]  and get to the amount of times that I have
[7259.67s -> 7261.67s]  pressed F1, just on that
[7261.67s -> 7263.91s]  beam, and do it all every level
[7263.91s -> 7265.91s]  over again, and that's how many times it takes.
[7303.78s -> 7306.79s]  No!
[7333.35s -> 7340.01s]  Okay, so we're fine. No, that's not the right one.
[7340.01s -> 7342.01s]  That's the save states not doing anything.
[7342.01s -> 7354.04s]  Oh, sad is deranged
[7354.04s -> 7357.30s]  Jeremy now. Wait, what?
[7357.30s -> 7359.30s]  I feel like this one's my wall.
[7359.30s -> 7362.06s]  I really do.
[7362.06s -> 7367.75s]  Oh my fucking god. I am going to
[7367.75s -> 7369.75s]  blow through the rest of this whole
[7369.75s -> 7372.57s]  thing. Once I get past this
[7372.57s -> 7375.26s]  level, I'm going to destroy the rest of the game.
[7375.26s -> 7377.26s]  This is the wall. This is the dumb wall that I have.
[7377.26s -> 7393.90s]  Oh my god, my whole world
[7393.90s -> 7397.48s]  is blending together. The whole world is together.
[7397.48s -> 7406.68s]  I can see everything.
[7406.68s -> 7408.68s]  How the fuck do people play this game?
[7408.68s -> 7412.71s]  It's so ridiculous. The amount of
[7412.71s -> 7414.71s]  coins. I'm going to need five people to come
[7414.71s -> 7416.71s]  into the arcade with me, all filled with diapers.
[7416.71s -> 7418.71s]  All having diapers on.
[7418.71s -> 7428.81s]  Take a break. In a minute.
[7428.81s -> 7430.81s]  I'll go pee in a minute
[7430.81s -> 7445.85s]  and get some water. Okay.
[7445.85s -> 7450.46s]  Let's not screw this up.
[7450.46s -> 7452.46s]  Easy. Let's get it right. Don't
[7452.46s -> 7454.46s]  even if I fall, it's okay. I can do it again.
[7454.46s -> 7473.59s]  You idiot!
[7473.59s -> 7493.86s]  I don't think there was enough
[7493.86s -> 7501.22s]  there wasn't enough time anyways.
[7501.22s -> 7503.22s]  There wasn't enough time anyways, even if I got to the end.
[7503.22s -> 7507.51s]  Oh my fucking god, you've got to be
[7507.51s -> 7509.88s]  kidding me. I have to go much faster than that.
[7509.88s -> 7511.88s]  I've got to go so much faster.
[7511.88s -> 7514.18s]  Oh my god, this is bad.
[7514.18s -> 7529.93s]  Okay, hold on. Fuck you!
[7529.93s -> 7554.76s]  Are we really going to
[7554.76s -> 7556.76s]  hold on guys. Fellas, are we really going to pull off the
[7556.76s -> 7560.41s]  is he pretending line?
[7560.41s -> 7562.41s]  How badly I don't want to be on this level anymore?
[7562.41s -> 7588.58s]  I'm overthinking it.
[7588.58s -> 7590.58s]  Oh my god, I'm stuck here forever.
[7590.58s -> 7592.58s]  I'm stuck here forever, I think.
[7592.58s -> 7594.58s]  I don't think I'll ever get by this ever.
[7594.58s -> 7600.09s]  Put on the face cam?
[7600.09s -> 7602.70s]  No. Oh, I look horrible
[7602.70s -> 7609.54s]  today. All right, slow down.
[7609.54s -> 7616.50s]  Not bad, not bad time.
[7616.50s -> 7618.50s]  Not bad time. Not a bad time.
[7618.50s -> 7646.28s]  Let's go. I do that.
[7646.28s -> 7687.86s]  Can't.
[7687.86s -> 7702.71s]  Risky move, risky move incoming.
[7702.71s -> 7748.92s]  Risky move, I got it. Risky move.
[7748.92s -> 7752.55s]  Okay.
[7752.55s -> 7755.62s]  That was that, that was, I made it.
[7755.62s -> 7757.62s]  About 700 people left the stream.
[7757.62s -> 7760.12s]  So, welcome back if
[7760.12s -> 7762.12s]  you decided to take a break and come back.
[7762.12s -> 7767.56s]  I don't blame you at all.
[7767.56s -> 7770.82s]  In fact, I agree with you.
[7770.82s -> 7775.18s]  Okay.
[7775.18s -> 7777.18s]  That, nothing can be as annoying
[7777.18s -> 7787.80s]  as that one just was.
[7787.80s -> 7789.80s]  All right, it's still fine. It's fine. This one's not bad.
[7789.80s -> 7797.22s]  I think I thought that was gonna work.
[7797.22s -> 7830.68s]  Okay,
[7830.68s -> 7832.68s]  I'd stop doing that. I'm gonna keep crashing
[7832.68s -> 7847.53s]  the fucking console.
[7847.53s -> 7849.53s]  Is Microsoft Edge your default browser?
[7849.53s -> 7855.34s]  What? All right, where we going?
[7855.34s -> 7857.34s]  Where is it? Up?
[7857.34s -> 7863.93s]  It's not up. It's down.
[7863.93s -> 7873.59s]  What? How do I get down there?
[7873.59s -> 7875.59s]  Oh, that was
[7875.59s -> 7877.59s]  hidden. This was not even
[7877.59s -> 7880.92s]  in the...
[7880.92s -> 7890.14s]  I just hold the back...
[7890.14s -> 7892.82s]  Holy shit, man.
[7892.82s -> 7894.82s]  No human can do this.
[7894.82s -> 7896.82s]  This is a game not for humans.
[7896.82s -> 7913.59s]  What the fuck does this keep happening
[7913.59s -> 7923.06s]  for? Imagine the damage you'd be doing
[7923.06s -> 7925.06s]  to your GameCube right now if you just kept on opening
[7925.06s -> 7927.37s]  the lid and ripping
[7927.37s -> 7929.37s]  the power button and pulling the power, like just
[7929.37s -> 7942.94s]  you try to break your console?
[7942.94s -> 7946.52s]  Nobody just gave a bunch of money.
[7946.52s -> 7948.52s]  50 community subs from Freddy Dread. What's up, Freddy?
[7948.52s -> 7950.52s]  Thanks for the huge amount of money.
[7950.52s -> 7957.88s]  Holy shit.
[7957.88s -> 7959.88s]  50 more subs from Freddy.
[7959.88s -> 7961.88s]  On top of like the 8,000 he's given the channel
[7961.88s -> 7970.01s]  over the couple of years.
[7970.01s -> 7972.01s]  I don't care. I can at least beat it.
[7972.01s -> 7977.19s]  I don't care if I lose my pride.
[7977.19s -> 7979.19s]  It's still hard. It's still really fucking hard.
[7979.19s -> 7983.67s]  Did IGN beat this game?
[7983.67s -> 7989.94s]  I don't think they did. What does this game have
[7989.94s -> 8005.82s]  for a score?
[8005.82s -> 8013.24s]  It's just
[8013.24s -> 8015.24s]  balance beam the video game.
[8015.24s -> 8022.66s]  No customizable monkeys?
[8022.66s -> 8037.32s]  Fucking shit.
[8037.32s -> 8039.82s]  Your mama didn't beat this game?
[8039.82s -> 8042.82s]  No. My mother probably couldn't
[8042.82s -> 8044.82s]  get through 1-1 on Mario.
[8044.82s -> 8047.64s]  She didn't even care.
[8047.64s -> 8049.94s]  I think my mother's played
[8049.94s -> 8063.83s]  three video games in her entire life.
[8063.83s -> 8065.83s]  Jesus.
[8065.83s -> 8067.83s]  I have to balance.
[8067.83s -> 8071.48s]  It's not even
[8071.48s -> 8073.48s]  supposed to be a broken game. It's running fast and slides.
[8089.54s -> 8094.92s]  Mario slide game, yeah.
[8094.92s -> 8096.92s]  Doctors play this game before surgery?
[8096.92s -> 8102.81s]  It's hard to watch. It's hard to play too.
[8102.81s -> 8104.81s]  Incredibly
[8104.81s -> 8106.81s]  hard to play.
[8106.81s -> 8126.82s]  The fuck?
[8131.11s -> 8133.11s]  This is the first medical exam you have to do?
[8133.11s -> 8140.34s]  Stay on it.
[8140.34s -> 8149.30s]  Jesus Christ.
[8149.30s -> 8151.30s]  Slow down.
[8151.30s -> 8154.12s]  Holy fuck.
[8154.12s -> 8178.25s]  Holy.
[8178.25s -> 8180.25s]  I might just pivot to brushing my teeth on screen.
[8180.25s -> 8204.23s]  Until they're raw.
[8204.23s -> 8206.23s]  You gotta keep them like right in the center.
[8206.23s -> 8213.59s]  Easy.
[8213.59s -> 8215.59s]  Easy.
[8215.59s -> 8220.84s]  Easy.
[8220.84s -> 8249.96s]  Imagine picking
[8249.96s -> 8252.20s]  anything besides 0.5.
[8252.20s -> 8255.59s]  I don't know how you do
[8255.59s -> 8259.43s]  anything besides 0.5.
[8259.43s -> 8261.43s]  What the fuck just happened? Don't even fucking tell me
[8261.43s -> 8266.42s]  everything crashed.
[8266.42s -> 8280.89s]  I need these bananas.
[8280.89s -> 8284.34s]  Alright, so if I make it halfway,
[8284.34s -> 8286.34s]  do I get to clock out my gamer card?
[8286.34s -> 8298.23s]  No?
[8298.23s -> 8301.05s]  What's Aspect Ratio doing?
[8301.05s -> 8303.05s]  Water levels really just fuck up everything on the graphics.
[8306.12s -> 8312.01s]  What the hell is this?
[8312.01s -> 8327.75s]  You're right.
[8327.75s -> 8329.75s]  This technically is a slide map. You're right.
[8329.75s -> 8333.53s]  I'm gonna hold back on the
[8333.53s -> 8338.58s]  controller. I don't want to go too fast.
[8338.58s -> 8345.82s]  But then I can't see.
[8345.82s -> 8348.18s]  Damn it. It's okay. I'm still alive.
[8348.18s -> 8359.06s]  I'm off along. Stay right in the middle.
[8359.06s -> 8363.35s]  What was wrong with that? What the fuck happened?
[8363.35s -> 8365.59s]  That was okay. What happened there?
[8365.59s -> 8375.00s]  I went right through it.
[8375.00s -> 8385.50s]  Holy shit, man.
[8385.50s -> 8394.52s]  You can fall off the side too.
[8394.52s -> 8399.58s]  That sucks. Oh my god.
[8402.20s -> 8424.71s]  Don't move. Don't move.
[8424.71s -> 8426.71s]  50 floors.
[8426.71s -> 8428.71s]  There's 50 of these.
[8428.71s -> 8433.24s]  50?
[8433.24s -> 8435.99s]  Probably can't just sit there, right?
[8435.99s -> 8441.62s]  It's a waste of time. Shit.
[8441.62s -> 8454.74s]  The camera really fucks with me too.
[8454.74s -> 8457.18s]  The camera only moves if you move
[8457.18s -> 8459.18s]  your body. And if you have to turn.
[8459.18s -> 8462.95s]  Like I can't press
[8462.95s -> 8464.95s]  the right stick to move the camera.
[8464.95s -> 8468.79s]  Wait for another cycle. Don't be an idiot.
[8468.79s -> 8471.10s]  You have 30 straight seconds.
[8471.10s -> 8481.91s]  Oh, Jesus. Okay.
[8481.91s -> 8483.91s]  Where am I?
[8483.91s -> 8498.17s]  Are you aware that you're not moving the monkey?
[8498.17s -> 8503.99s]  Jesus blew my mind there, dude.
[8503.99s -> 8510.46s]  I am now.
[8510.46s -> 8525.24s]  Easy here.
[8525.24s -> 8527.61s]  Okay. Fine. Fine. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy.
[8527.61s -> 8529.61s]  Straight. Straight on. Straight on.
[8529.61s -> 8532.49s]  You fucking stupid idiot.
[8532.49s -> 8543.43s]  What? What?
[8543.43s -> 8545.43s]  What happened?
[8545.43s -> 8547.86s]  What was that wrong?
[8547.86s -> 8549.86s]  Am I not going fast enough?
[8549.86s -> 8562.02s]  I mean, I don't have a jump.
[8562.02s -> 8569.06s]  I'm starting to tilt.
[8569.06s -> 8571.43s]  I can't tilt right now. Relax.
[8571.43s -> 8585.00s]  Don't tilt. Just play.
[8585.00s -> 8587.24s]  We're good. That saved a bunch of time
[8587.24s -> 8603.37s]  right there.
[8603.37s -> 8605.37s]  Why?
[8605.37s -> 8607.37s]  You have to
[8607.37s -> 8609.37s]  go so fast. You can't go that fast.
[8609.37s -> 8611.37s]  How many times?
[8611.37s -> 8629.27s]  Press the jump.
[8629.27s -> 8631.27s]  There is no jump.
[8631.27s -> 8633.27s]  How many times do we have to go over this?
[8633.27s -> 8635.51s]  There's no jump button.
[8640.42s -> 8642.42s]  You gotta hold the
[8642.42s -> 8644.42s]  ground down while you go.
[8644.42s -> 8649.42s]  This sucks.
[8649.42s -> 8651.42s]  Let me see what happens. Don't go that fast.
[8651.42s -> 8654.30s]  Go fast enough.
[8654.30s -> 8656.30s]  I got it. I got it. I got it.
[8656.30s -> 8659.62s]  Now what?
[8659.62s -> 8661.62s]  Not fucking around here.
[8661.62s -> 8679.98s]  Inball machine things here?
[8679.98s -> 8694.50s]  I know some of you guys are saying, dude, what the fuck?
[8694.50s -> 8696.74s]  Save states.
[8696.74s -> 8698.74s]  This stream would have ended an hour and a half ago
[8698.74s -> 8700.74s]  to have access to save states.
[8700.74s -> 8702.74s]  Shit, look at all...
[8702.74s -> 8719.18s]  This is so tight.
[8719.18s -> 8733.13s]  Get...
[8733.13s -> 8735.13s]  One of these times you're gonna lose the save state and that's when we
[8735.13s -> 8759.70s]  pivot to something else. AI dungeon?
[8759.70s -> 8763.67s]  Maybe. We'll see.
[8763.67s -> 8770.01s]  I'm still having fun with this.
[8770.01s -> 8772.31s]  God, dude, what the fuck?
[8772.31s -> 8774.31s]  You gotta stay so far on the left.
[8774.31s -> 8784.81s]  Dude, go pee?
[8784.81s -> 8790.25s]  I'm about to grab this ball
[8790.25s -> 8792.25s]  and just chuck it a hundred yards.
[8792.25s -> 8794.81s]  Where's the master hand that can come down
[8794.81s -> 8796.81s]  and grab this ball and just fucking shot put it?
[8796.81s -> 8822.60s]  I feel like
[8822.60s -> 8824.60s]  you guys are talking about the speedrunners that have
[8824.60s -> 8826.60s]  sped around this game that are like, oh yeah, I speedrun this.
[8826.60s -> 8831.38s]  Do they have any teeth left?
[8831.38s -> 8841.18s]  I feel like it's just a mouthful of gums.
[8841.18s -> 8843.18s]  Like just from mashing your teeth down, just grinding them down.
[8843.18s -> 8851.50s]  Gee, sorry.
[8851.50s -> 8857.96s]  They know how to jump for starters.
[8857.96s -> 8859.96s]  I'm gonna press every single button.
[8859.96s -> 8865.14s]  Ready?
[8865.14s -> 8868.54s]  Wait, what? This one's easy.
[8868.54s -> 8885.74s]  Just go straight on.
[8885.74s -> 8894.04s]  There we go.
[8894.04s -> 8896.04s]  Oh man, this one doesn't look fun either.
[8896.04s -> 8906.73s]  God.
[8906.73s -> 8909.29s]  There's 35 flows left.
[8909.29s -> 8912.10s]  I don't think I'm gonna beat this game.
[8912.10s -> 8921.96s]  What about the sticks?
[8921.96s -> 8925.61s]  I did. Let me at least just even see
[8925.61s -> 8927.61s]  what the hell. I think you have to go all the way up
[8927.61s -> 8930.04s]  from corner to corner.
[8930.04s -> 8934.57s]  See what happens. Ready?
[8934.57s -> 8945.70s]  I mean, kind of.
[8945.70s -> 8950.50s]  Holy shit, I have no idea.
[8950.50s -> 8952.50s]  Dude, Monkey Ball 2 is easier and it has
[8952.50s -> 8960.76s]  infinite lives.
[8960.76s -> 8962.76s]  Well, I mean, I'm already in expert mode.
[8962.76s -> 8966.15s]  This way there. You'll know when I'm done.
[8966.15s -> 8972.23s]  I don't get this one.
[8972.23s -> 8978.25s]  Hop across?
[8978.25s -> 8983.10s]  Like, the gap here?
[8983.10s -> 8997.18s]  Holy shit, okay.
[8997.18s -> 9001.02s]  Speedrunners do this game in 25 minutes.
[9001.02s -> 9003.02s]  Yeah, that's insane.
[9003.02s -> 9012.23s]  GTA 4 waiting room.
[9012.23s -> 9014.23s]  What are you talking about? When did I ever say I was gonna play
[9014.23s -> 9017.82s]  GTA 4?
[9017.82s -> 9030.30s]  GTA 4?
[9030.30s -> 9040.41s]  I don't feel like Grim Fandango.
[9040.41s -> 9042.65s]  That's a good old game.
[9042.65s -> 9044.65s]  I played through it a couple times though.
[9044.65s -> 9065.30s]  Shit!
[9065.30s -> 9067.30s]  God, this is gonna make me sick.
[9067.30s -> 9078.50s]  What about The Neverhood?
[9078.50s -> 9080.50s]  I thought about playing The Neverhood a long time ago.
[9080.50s -> 9084.46s]  But this is before
[9084.46s -> 9088.04s]  Armacrog came out.
[9088.04s -> 9090.04s]  I was really excited for Armacrog because Armacrog was
[9090.04s -> 9092.04s]  by the same group that made The Neverhood.
[9092.04s -> 9094.28s]  It was a Kickstarter project.
[9094.28s -> 9096.28s]  And it was okay.
[9096.28s -> 9098.58s]  If I'm honest.
[9098.58s -> 9111.30s]  No!
[9111.30s -> 9113.30s]  It was okay. I don't think they could
[9113.30s -> 9115.30s]  capture the same kind of magic they had with The Neverhood.
[9115.30s -> 9126.38s]  Dude, how do you
[9126.38s -> 9128.38s]  turn the game board sideways
[9128.38s -> 9130.62s]  to go through that? How do you go through that thing?
[9130.62s -> 9132.98s]  Did they just turn it sideways
[9132.98s -> 9134.98s]  just to say fuck you, you'll never beat the game?
[9134.98s -> 9152.76s]  This is a...
[9152.76s -> 9155.90s]  What is this? Okay, this one looks awesome.
[9155.90s -> 9164.22s]  We unlocked a mini game.
[9164.22s -> 9172.26s]  Ooh!
[9172.26s -> 9177.06s]  Let's check that out. I'm gonna piss.
[9177.06s -> 9361.58s]  I gotta pee.
[9361.58s -> 9366.63s]  Alright, I'm good. Got some water?
[9366.63s -> 9369.64s]  Happy birthday! Hey, thanks a lot.
[9369.64s -> 9372.26s]  I appreciate that. Oh, by the way,
[9372.26s -> 9374.26s]  I'm not doing a
[9374.26s -> 9377.21s]  birthday stream.
[9377.21s -> 9379.83s]  I'm gonna take
[9379.83s -> 9381.83s]  tomorrow and probably the next day off.
[9381.83s -> 9385.99s]  I'll be back on Thursday of this week.
[9385.99s -> 9388.30s]  Thursday and Friday are gonna be
[9388.30s -> 9390.66s]  interesting because Thursday,
[9390.66s -> 9393.16s]  the Left 4 Dead 2
[9393.16s -> 9395.16s]  new community campaign
[9395.16s -> 9398.23s]  thing comes out. Gonna be playing that
[9398.23s -> 9400.73s]  with Joel
[9400.73s -> 9403.35s]  Tyler from Valve News
[9403.35s -> 9405.35s]  Network and Simple Flips.
[9405.35s -> 9408.17s]  That's sort of the plan tentatively right now.
[9408.17s -> 9411.94s]  I'm kind of rusty at Left 4 Dead, but I think I still got it.
[9411.94s -> 9415.14s]  And then on Friday,
[9415.14s -> 9417.83s]  Friday of this week,
[9417.83s -> 9419.83s]  I'm gonna be a guest on
[9419.83s -> 9421.83s]  Kitboga's stream.
[9421.83s -> 9430.78s]  I'll be messing around for a couple of hours.
[9430.78s -> 9435.77s]  That should be fun too. I don't know what the
[9435.77s -> 9437.77s]  exact plan is, but I just know that that's
[9437.77s -> 9443.27s]  gonna happen. It's a double pog
[9443.27s -> 9446.41s]  moment, yeah. Well, thanks for the birthday wishes.
[9446.41s -> 9448.41s]  I've seen some of the things people are already making.
[9448.41s -> 9452.92s]  It means a lot. Thank you.
[9452.92s -> 9454.92s]  But yeah, no stream as of tomorrow
[9454.92s -> 9457.67s]  or the next day. I'll be back Thursday
[9457.67s -> 9462.41s]  and then Friday. I'll probably stream on Saturday too.
[9462.41s -> 9464.41s]  Let's keep going. What happened? Where is it?
[9464.41s -> 9469.46s]  Did the game crash?
[9469.46s -> 9472.15s]  Yeah, it's crashed. When was the last state?
[9472.15s -> 9480.60s]  I don't know. Oh yeah, Left 4 Dead should be
[9480.60s -> 9482.78s]  fun. It's been a very long time since I
[9482.78s -> 9494.42s]  played it. That link is funny.
[9494.42s -> 9501.51s]  Is it?
[9501.51s -> 9507.34s]  Alright, let me slow down here.
[9507.34s -> 9509.34s]  Don't go that fast. Alright, you go much
[9509.34s -> 9513.56s]  faster than the thing spins.
[9513.56s -> 9515.56s]  AI dungeon?
[9515.56s -> 9518.06s]  Give me another minute. Still not done.
[9518.06s -> 9525.08s]  Jesus.
[9525.08s -> 9527.08s]  I don't think it should be happening like this.
[9527.08s -> 9530.73s]  I don't think it's supposed to be like this.
[9530.73s -> 9532.73s]  Wait, am I supposed to switch sides?
[9532.73s -> 9535.48s]  Oh, okay.
[9535.48s -> 9538.49s]  I get it. I'm going
[9538.49s -> 9541.94s]  the wrong way. Oh man,
[9541.94s -> 9551.67s]  that's gonna be so hard.
[9551.67s -> 9553.67s]  Okay, you gotta get in each individual
[9553.67s -> 9557.96s]  thing. This is tricky.
[9557.96s -> 9570.10s]  Ugh. Happy 39th
[9570.10s -> 9572.10s]  birthday? Not that old. Not
[9572.10s -> 9577.03s]  that old. Close though.
[9577.03s -> 9581.18s]  You are close.
[9581.18s -> 9587.83s]  Fucking game crashed again. 45?
[9587.83s -> 9606.58s]  No, not 45.
[9606.58s -> 9608.58s]  This is my own fault. I keep doing it to myself.
[9608.58s -> 9610.58s]  But, you know, anything to get through expert,
[9610.58s -> 9612.58s]  right? Anything.
[9612.58s -> 9617.26s]  It'll do anything to get through expert.
[9617.26s -> 9629.85s]  Where's the save?
[9629.85s -> 9643.42s]  No, not gonna happen. Get in it!
[9643.42s -> 9645.42s]  What the fuck, dude?
[9645.42s -> 9655.72s]  Are you looking both ways before
[9655.72s -> 9657.72s]  you cross the fucking road?
[9657.72s -> 9673.14s]  Ugh. I would've
[9673.14s -> 9675.14s]  already eaten the controller if I was 13 and I played
[9675.14s -> 9677.51s]  this. The controller would've been part of
[9677.51s -> 9679.51s]  a fucking soup. I would've chopped it up
[9679.51s -> 9681.51s]  into a bunch of pieces and put it into my stew.
[9681.51s -> 9700.33s]  Come on, dude.
[9700.33s -> 9713.64s]  What the fuck?
[9713.64s -> 9737.06s]  No! Stupid!
[9737.06s -> 9740.84s]  Ugh.
[9740.84s -> 9742.84s]  It's not- I already- It's already- I already blew it. If I blew it,
[9742.84s -> 9759.74s]  it's already over. I keep going backwards
[9759.74s -> 9761.74s]  because the save state was done and crashed
[9761.74s -> 9776.06s]  the game. Get in there! Gotta
[9776.06s -> 9778.06s]  reach into the diaper and get some quarters.
[9778.06s -> 9780.87s]  I do agree with you. That would be fucked up if I reached
[9780.87s -> 9782.87s]  into my diaper to get quarters.
[9782.87s -> 9785.30s]  But,
[9785.30s -> 9787.30s]  would it really be that big of a deal? If it was
[9787.30s -> 9798.63s]  over the pants?
[9801.26s -> 9812.25s]  Come on!
[9812.25s -> 9830.98s]  Alright, how do you- How the fuck you do this one?
[9830.98s -> 9834.89s]  It just dumps you.
[9834.89s -> 9847.18s]  Stay in the middle?
[9847.18s -> 9856.63s]  No, that's not gonna work.
[9856.63s -> 9858.63s]  Right up the side? Yeah, that's what I was trying to do before.
[9858.63s -> 9864.97s]  Just holding left?
[9864.97s -> 9880.65s]  Go slower?
[9880.65s -> 9882.65s]  I don't think it's slower. That wouldn't-
[9882.65s -> 9887.45s]  I can't- It's not gonna go slower.
[9887.45s -> 9891.10s]  Built the stage with the other
[9891.10s -> 9893.10s]  analog? I don't think that works.
[9893.10s -> 9903.19s]  Stay on it!
[9903.19s -> 9911.51s]  I just heard a crunch and I don't know
[9911.51s -> 9925.53s]  what it was. I'm trying to stay all the
[9925.53s -> 9927.53s]  way to the left, but it just dumps you.
[9927.53s -> 9940.12s]  Stay...
[9940.12s -> 9942.12s]  But if I get on the edge, it just falls off.
[9942.12s -> 9944.74s]  I can't even get on it.
[9944.74s -> 9954.09s]  Okay, it just- What happened there?
[9954.09s -> 9956.33s]  Why did he flip over? You don't-
[9956.33s -> 9966.44s]  You can't fall down and
[9966.44s -> 9973.16s]  tilt the GameCube.
[9973.16s -> 9975.16s]  Don't ever push right? I- I haven't once.
[9975.16s -> 9978.04s]  I'm only holding
[9978.04s -> 9980.41s]  up or left. Like I'm holding
[9980.41s -> 9987.96s]  left right now.
[9987.96s -> 9994.04s]  Hold right instead.
[9994.04s -> 10007.42s]  I'll try right side. You think it's broken?
[10007.42s -> 10009.42s]  I don't think so. I think it's just- I don't know.
[10009.42s -> 10019.38s]  I think it's just being weird.
[10019.38s -> 10021.38s]  Why do they- Is there a secret exit behind
[10021.38s -> 10023.38s]  the start? Sure there is.
[10023.38s -> 10025.38s]  Why did I listen to you?
[10025.38s -> 10028.65s]  There's nothing here.
[10028.65s -> 10033.64s]  You're lying.
[10033.64s -> 10039.02s]  You have to tilt
[10039.02s -> 10041.02s]  right or tilt left?
[10041.02s -> 10044.47s]  Like in the movie Cars?
[10044.47s -> 10047.22s]  Cars?
[10047.22s -> 10058.04s]  What are you talking about?
[10058.04s -> 10061.82s]  You remember in the movie Cars when
[10061.82s -> 10064.50s]  when
[10064.50s -> 10067.64s]  Flash Lightning
[10067.64s -> 10069.64s]  goes over the tutorial of how to play Monkey
[10069.64s -> 10075.98s]  Ball? Turn right
[10075.98s -> 10078.47s]  to go left.
[10078.47s -> 10081.86s]  You don't understand.
[10081.86s -> 10087.30s]  I can't go
[10087.30s -> 10089.30s]  faster. There is no faster.
[10089.30s -> 10091.30s]  Look at the real estate that I have.
[10091.30s -> 10093.30s]  I can't feel the speed here.
[10093.30s -> 10105.53s]  We tried to stop going full about just pushing
[10105.53s -> 10107.53s]  left. That's actually a good call.
[10107.53s -> 10110.66s]  That's not a bad idea.
[10110.66s -> 10112.66s]  Just hold right.
[10112.66s -> 10114.66s]  That might actually work.
[10114.66s -> 10122.73s]  Hold on.
[10122.73s -> 10129.26s]  I think you really do just have to
[10129.26s -> 10131.26s]  stay right on the edge here.
[10131.26s -> 10133.26s]  Once it starts to go that far up you just
[10133.26s -> 10135.26s]  can't go anywhere.
[10135.26s -> 10142.86s]  Start on the lower side and move
[10142.86s -> 10144.86s]  forward and towards the higher side to have
[10144.86s -> 10146.86s]  momentum upwards.
[10146.86s -> 10149.42s]  Like slide down and then up.
[10149.42s -> 10151.42s]  This is too much for my fucking
[10151.42s -> 10153.42s]  toddler brain to do.
[10155.42s -> 10178.58s]  Can you surf like a wave?
[10178.58s -> 10183.26s]  I don't know.
[10183.26s -> 10185.26s]  You can flip the board over if you stay on one side
[10185.26s -> 10187.26s]  then it will stay flat.
[10187.26s -> 10192.63s]  How much time does it actually take to go through the whole
[10192.63s -> 10194.63s]  cycle here?
[10194.63s -> 10196.81s]  See what happens?
[10196.81s -> 10198.81s]  It goes like dump!
[10198.81s -> 10200.81s]  Right at the end. There's like a little dump at the end.
[10200.81s -> 10203.56s]  There's a little more momentum right like at the end.
[10203.56s -> 10214.95s]  I picked the worst character
[10214.95s -> 10218.41s]  for this. I didn't know that the Monkey
[10218.41s -> 10220.41s]  Ball characters had different stats.
[10220.41s -> 10222.41s]  Isn't that not even right?
[10222.41s -> 10232.52s]  See if I try to pull
[10232.52s -> 10234.52s]  hard left.
[10234.52s -> 10236.52s]  It just doesn't matter. You go over or
[10236.52s -> 10242.60s]  it dumps you anyways. Just watch the speed
[10242.60s -> 10244.60s]  run. No, I don't want to be embarrassed.
[10244.60s -> 10261.88s]  Use the speed run strat.
[10261.88s -> 10264.82s]  What's the speed run strat?
[10264.82s -> 10268.73s]  I'm curious.
[10268.73s -> 10270.73s]  I feel like this one, I don't understand this.
[10270.73s -> 10273.35s]  Yeah.
[10273.35s -> 10275.35s]  So funny. You're making me
[10275.35s -> 10277.35s]  cry laughing right now.
[10277.35s -> 10279.35s]  It's absolutely hysterical
[10279.35s -> 10284.98s]  to me.
[10284.98s -> 10286.98s]  It is. Okay, it is. I'll be honest with you.
[10286.98s -> 10288.98s]  It is. It was pretty funny.
[10288.98s -> 10299.98s]  Shit. You're doing the same
[10299.98s -> 10301.98s]  thing over and over and you're expecting different results.
[10301.98s -> 10305.62s]  What else
[10305.62s -> 10309.08s]  am I supposed to do?
[10309.08s -> 10311.08s]  I'm trying to just hold. You can't.
[10311.08s -> 10313.08s]  I think this is
[10313.08s -> 10317.94s]  the end of the game. What if
[10317.94s -> 10319.94s]  I don't move at all and just hold left?
[10319.94s -> 10325.43s]  No.
[10325.43s -> 10329.02s]  Actually just stay in the middle.
[10329.02s -> 10331.02s]  Yeah, you can't though.
[10331.02s -> 10339.98s]  I feel like I almost had it.
[10339.98s -> 10350.65s]  Give me the link.
[10350.65s -> 10352.65s]  See how to beat this dumbass level. How do I beat it?
[10352.65s -> 10356.23s]  Super Monkey Ball. Expert 18.
[10356.23s -> 10358.41s]  Okay.
[10358.41s -> 10364.04s]  What the fuck is going on here?
[10364.04s -> 10371.83s]  Okay, so he, it's when
[10371.83s -> 10373.83s]  it starts to tilt over to the right.
[10373.83s -> 10375.83s]  He runs down
[10375.83s -> 10377.83s]  and then, let me try this
[10377.83s -> 10388.63s]  shit.
[10388.63s -> 10390.63s]  It's right when it starts to go down and then starts to move up again.
[10390.63s -> 10393.64s]  Here we go, like now. Fuck you.
[10393.64s -> 10401.83s]  You have to catch it like when it's coming back up.
[10401.83s -> 10405.99s]  Like,
[10405.99s -> 10409.32s]  now. No, I don't,
[10409.32s -> 10411.32s]  I'm doing what he's doing. I'm doing what he's doing.
[10411.32s -> 10416.31s]  It doesn't work. Okay, by the way,
[10416.31s -> 10418.31s]  the video starts like, he's
[10418.31s -> 10423.94s]  in the middle of doing something already.
[10423.94s -> 10425.94s]  He's like already on the move when the video starts.
[10425.94s -> 10428.82s]  He's already got like a bunch of speed.
[10428.82s -> 10444.44s]  Oh, what's the video?
[10444.44s -> 10446.44s]  All right, hey, look.
[10446.44s -> 10448.44s]  Watch, there's still a lot of rushes.
[10448.44s -> 10464.87s]  Check this out.
[10464.87s -> 10470.12s]  Like all the ads.
[10470.12s -> 10479.02s]  What am I doing wrong?
[10479.02s -> 10481.02s]  What did I just delete?
[10481.02s -> 10483.02s]  I just deleted something on my browser.
[10483.02s -> 10486.34s]  Oh, no, I deleted
[10486.34s -> 10492.04s]  the game.
[10492.04s -> 10494.04s]  I'm so fucking angry.
[10494.04s -> 10500.70s]  Hold on.
[10500.70s -> 10514.90s]  I'm pivoting to AI Dungeon.
[10514.90s -> 10516.90s]  I'm done. I'm done with it. I'm done with this game.
[10516.90s -> 10521.64s]  I'm done with this one.
[10521.64s -> 10536.60s]  Twitter, you get to see this.
[10536.60s -> 10539.16s]  They're spying on me. Get out of here.
[10539.16s -> 10564.70s]  That's what he did in the video.
[10564.70s -> 10567.06s]  That's what he did in the video.
[10567.06s -> 10570.44s]  He went like,
[10570.44s -> 10581.70s]  do a different monkey.
[10581.70s -> 10584.39s]  But how?
[10584.39s -> 10587.53s]  I have to quit the game.
[10587.53s -> 10589.53s]  How do we use a different monkey? That's stupid.
[10589.53s -> 10591.53s]  What, I go through half the game and then it's like,
[10591.53s -> 10593.53s]  well, sorry, you weren't the monkey you needed
[10593.53s -> 10601.98s]  to be this time.
[10601.98s -> 10615.86s]  Mangan is the worst.
[10615.86s -> 10628.22s]  This is literally a disinformation
[10628.22s -> 10633.91s]  campaign.
[10633.91s -> 10636.66s]  I came
[10636.66s -> 10638.66s]  here for monkey ball, not monkey bitch.
[10638.66s -> 10640.66s]  Okay, that person deserves a timeout.
[10640.66s -> 10642.66s]  I want that person to get a timeout.
[10642.66s -> 10644.66s]  Like for ten minutes.
[10644.66s -> 10647.16s]  That person deserves at least a five
[10647.16s -> 10649.16s]  minute quiet period.
[10649.16s -> 10660.49s]  It's alright. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.
[10660.49s -> 10664.52s]  I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be...
[10664.52s -> 10673.35s]  No, I'm not.
[10673.35s -> 10686.98s]  You fucker.
[10686.98s -> 10693.83s]  Okay, here we go. That's it. That's it. That was almost it.
[10693.83s -> 10695.83s]  That was close. That was really, really close.
[10695.83s -> 10699.10s]  You gotta catch it
[10699.10s -> 10701.10s]  at the exact moment that it starts to come on
[10701.10s -> 10703.10s]  the momentum to go down to up.
[10703.10s -> 10706.68s]  Right now.
[10706.68s -> 10710.14s]  Stupid game.
[10710.14s -> 10717.18s]  No, you stupid game.
[10717.18s -> 10760.42s]  Come on!
[10760.42s -> 10762.42s]  Dude, that's... How the fuck do you
[10762.42s -> 10772.60s]  do this shit? Dude, was this like Mario
[10772.60s -> 10774.60s]  Maker? Did anyone in the office beat this level?
[10774.60s -> 10777.10s]  Or did they just make it and go,
[10777.10s -> 10779.66s]  that looks good. Did anybody do it?
[10779.66s -> 10790.92s]  No. Looks good though.
[10790.92s -> 10796.81s]  Put a hand cam on.
[10796.81s -> 10798.81s]  I'm not gonna put on a hand cam.
[10798.81s -> 10827.80s]  Hand cam tutorial
[10827.80s -> 10835.35s]  for this level.
[10835.35s -> 10838.81s]  You're not serious, are you? Are you fucking
[10838.81s -> 10845.34s]  kidding me?
[10845.34s -> 10847.34s]  This shit don't happen in my game.
[10847.34s -> 10849.34s]  This shit doesn't happen in my game.
[10849.34s -> 10852.79s]  I just fly off the edge.
[10852.79s -> 10857.08s]  I just fly
[10857.08s -> 10859.08s]  off the edge.
[10859.08s -> 10861.08s]  Okay, I'm gonna do exactly what this person...
[10861.08s -> 10863.08s]  So they land immediately when it's flat.
[10863.08s -> 10865.51s]  They go to the right. They tilt.
[10865.51s -> 10867.51s]  They stay on the right side. I've already been off the
[10867.51s -> 10874.36s]  left edge, by the way, at this point.
[10874.36s -> 10906.62s]  There we go. There is no
[10906.62s -> 10929.66s]  jump.
[10929.66s -> 10931.66s]  I'm trying to tilt with the...
[10931.66s -> 10934.79s]  You have to bind a key to jump.
[10934.79s -> 10950.92s]  I'm gonna freak out.
[10950.92s -> 10952.92s]  Dude, I'm holding up, holding le...
[10952.92s -> 10954.92s]  I don't matter. I'm tilting. I'm...
[10954.92s -> 10956.92s]  I'm finessing.
[10956.92s -> 10958.92s]  I'm tilting.
[10958.92s -> 10960.92s]  I'm tilting.
[10960.92s -> 10962.92s]  I fell off the fucking edge, dude.
[10962.92s -> 10985.32s]  All the way to the right.
[10985.32s -> 10987.75s]  Okay, I'm gonna do this frame by frame.
[10987.75s -> 10991.53s]  They're not even touching any button.
[10991.53s -> 10993.53s]  They're holding right. Okay, that's what I was doing.
[10993.53s -> 10995.90s]  And then they hold left
[10995.90s -> 10997.90s]  when it moves. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm
[10997.90s -> 11022.34s]  trying to do. I was gonna do the...
[11022.34s -> 11024.34s]  Okay, ready? Just go right. Do exactly what
[11024.34s -> 11059.34s]  they do.
[11059.34s -> 11061.34s]  I'm about to just rip the fucking
[11061.34s -> 11063.34s]  power button off of my computer.
[11063.34s -> 11081.64s]  You should hit triangle
[11081.64s -> 11084.97s]  to grind.
[11084.97s -> 11090.46s]  You have to go fast.
[11090.46s -> 11092.89s]  I'm trying to hold
[11092.89s -> 11095.13s]  left. Hold right.
[11095.13s -> 11098.46s]  I didn't even...
[11098.46s -> 11100.46s]  This is so ridiculous.
[11100.46s -> 11102.46s]  I didn't even mean to do that this time.
[11102.46s -> 11106.47s]  Hold left.
[11106.47s -> 11108.47s]  Okay, I don't fucking know. I can't do
[11108.47s -> 11111.54s]  anything else.
[11111.54s -> 11113.54s]  What do you mean, finally listen? That's what I've been trying
[11113.54s -> 11115.54s]  to do this entire time.
[11115.54s -> 11137.11s]  No, you piece of shit.
[11137.11s -> 11146.01s]  Alright, I'm jumping off and I'm holding
[11146.01s -> 11149.91s]  left and forward at the same time.
[11149.91s -> 11151.91s]  If I do that too quickly, I fall off.
[11151.91s -> 11170.26s]  It's dumping me.
[11170.26s -> 11173.27s]  Tilting. Just go forward.
[11173.27s -> 11175.27s]  It's not gonna do anything.
[11175.27s -> 11181.67s]  Just cap
[11181.67s -> 11183.67s]  the FPS. What do you mean, cap the FPS?
[11183.67s -> 11186.23s]  What?
[11186.23s -> 11198.90s]  Don't slow down. Guys, I am
[11198.90s -> 11201.53s]  holding forward.
[11201.53s -> 11203.53s]  I'm not hitting back at all. I'm
[11203.53s -> 11205.53s]  only going forward or left.
[11205.53s -> 11209.24s]  I'm not tilting the controller back.
[11209.24s -> 11222.68s]  Why do you think I'm doing that?
[11222.68s -> 11224.68s]  Try doing it backwards.
[11224.68s -> 11230.50s]  This is insane.
[11230.50s -> 11238.68s]  Imagine needing to do this
[11238.68s -> 11243.67s]  this many times. Turn the tilt
[11243.67s -> 11250.84s]  controls off. Use the
[11250.84s -> 11257.88s]  keyboard.
[11257.88s -> 11269.46s]  This may be a dumb question, but are you using
[11269.46s -> 11271.46s]  an actual GameCube controller? No.
[11271.46s -> 11284.18s]  I am not. Good luck
[11284.18s -> 11286.18s]  then. What do you mean, good luck then?
[11286.18s -> 11293.54s]  What do you mean?
[11293.54s -> 11295.54s]  What do you mean, good luck then?
[11295.54s -> 11307.13s]  What's that mean?
[11307.13s -> 11309.43s]  That's your problem. What?
[11309.43s -> 11311.43s]  No, it's not. There hasn't been a problem so far.
[11311.43s -> 11325.90s]  How long
[11325.90s -> 11327.90s]  have I been on this level?
[11327.90s -> 11329.90s]  Probably like 35 minutes.
[11329.90s -> 11336.04s]  Start by going left and turn right to get
[11336.04s -> 11338.28s]  momentum.
[11338.28s -> 11340.28s]  If I do that too fast, I just
[11340.28s -> 11353.34s]  go right off.
[11353.34s -> 11364.79s]  I got it, I got it.
[11364.79s -> 11366.79s]  I got it, I got it.
[11366.79s -> 11368.79s]  I know exactly what to do.
[11368.79s -> 11370.79s]  Trust me, I got it. This is fucking the real one
[11370.79s -> 11372.79s]  right here coming up.
[11372.79s -> 11375.22s]  One of these. I know what I have to do.
[11375.22s -> 11377.59s]  Check it out. I'll get it in a
[11377.59s -> 11379.59s]  second. Wait, one second. Give me a second.
[11379.59s -> 11385.86s]  Shit.
[11385.86s -> 11397.88s]  Dude.
[11397.88s -> 11411.64s]  Come on. This is so
[11411.64s -> 11421.50s]  frustrating.
[11421.50s -> 11423.86s]  Just leave this game.
[11423.86s -> 11425.86s]  I can't do that right now. I have to beat this level
[11425.86s -> 11446.73s]  or else I won't be able to go to sleep tonight.
[11446.73s -> 11448.73s]  Is your FPS capped?
[11448.73s -> 11452.06s]  Would that even matter?
[11452.06s -> 11471.19s]  I don't think that would really matter.
[11471.19s -> 11473.19s]  I feel like the game is just forcing me down the fucking hole.
[11473.19s -> 11481.83s]  Cap the frame rate.
[11481.83s -> 11483.83s]  Cap the frame rate. To what?
[11483.83s -> 11489.02s]  Hey, I'm the one that said, hold on.
[11489.02s -> 11491.02s]  Wait, wait, wait. Hey, I'm the one that said Monkey Ball
[11491.02s -> 11493.02s]  was like Mario Slope Racing.
[11493.02s -> 11495.02s]  I said Monkey Ball 2, not this
[11495.02s -> 11500.78s]  piece of shit.
[11500.78s -> 11505.19s]  Hey, easy.
[11505.19s -> 11507.19s]  Easy.
[11507.19s -> 11509.75s]  Change monkeys for the love of God.
[11509.75s -> 11511.75s]  But that means I have to lose my everything
[11511.75s -> 11520.65s]  here, don't I?
[11520.65s -> 11524.42s]  No. Redo. Who cares?
[11524.42s -> 11526.60s]  Who gives a shit?
[11526.60s -> 11530.38s]  It doesn't matter. It's not the monkey.
[11530.38s -> 11543.56s]  I'm trying to do exactly what the thing does
[11543.56s -> 11545.93s]  in the video.
[11545.93s -> 11547.93s]  They go right here. And it's like boom.
[11547.93s -> 11555.86s]  Now they're tilting a little.
[11555.86s -> 11559.45s]  What did he say?
[11559.45s -> 11561.45s]  FPS cap in Dolphin SMB emulation has been
[11561.45s -> 11563.45s]  bound to cause significant issues down the line towards
[11563.45s -> 11565.45s]  the later half of the advanced levels.
[11565.45s -> 11571.58s]  What?
[11571.58s -> 11573.58s]  Physics are based on frame rate. Cap your frame rate.
[11573.58s -> 11578.63s]  Don't even fucking tell me this is all...
[11578.63s -> 11584.39s]  How do I do that?
[11584.39s -> 11589.45s]  Cap my frame rate?
[11589.45s -> 11591.45s]  How do I do that? Graphics?
[11591.45s -> 11594.20s]  Turn on V-sync?
[11594.20s -> 11608.90s]  How do I do that? V-sync.
[11608.90s -> 11613.11s]  Cap it at 30.
[11613.11s -> 11616.06s]  Anti-Ala-sync. He read my
[11616.06s -> 11618.06s]  comment out loud and he ignored it.
[11618.06s -> 11622.60s]  I did? Wait, wait, what do I cap
[11622.60s -> 11624.60s]  frame rate in, uh, fucking
[11624.60s -> 11626.60s]  Senator, uh...
[11626.60s -> 11631.91s]  Swordfish. Monkey Ball ran
[11631.91s -> 11638.30s]  at 30.
[11638.30s -> 11640.30s]  You ignored it again?
[11640.30s -> 11645.99s]  I didn't ignore it again. I didn't even see it.
[11645.99s -> 11650.98s]  Figuration, hold on. Okay, well how do I do that?
[11650.98s -> 11652.98s]  That's 16x9 gecko code.
[11652.98s -> 11654.98s]  I don't know what the fuck that is.
[11654.98s -> 11659.14s]  Gecko code?
[11659.14s -> 11661.32s]  Floor 18.
[11661.32s -> 11663.32s]  Original Monkey Ball ran at 30. 45
[11663.32s -> 11665.32s]  on LCD and 50 on a screen projector.
[11665.32s -> 11670.06s]  Go back
[11670.06s -> 11672.06s]  for fucking boots. Can somebody just tell me
[11672.06s -> 11674.06s]  what setting, what box
[11674.06s -> 11676.23s]  do I check? Read this!
[11676.23s -> 11678.23s]  The game carried none of the level
[11678.23s -> 11680.23s]  design to the sequel. 2 is a fun
[11680.23s -> 11682.23s]  racing game. This one is a bullshit obstacle course.
[11682.23s -> 11685.88s]  Monkey Ball Torture from Wikipedia,
[11685.88s -> 11687.88s]  the free encyclopedia.org.
[11687.88s -> 11689.88s]  Monkey Ball Torture, what?
[11689.88s -> 11696.47s]  Somebody has a tutorial here?
[11696.47s -> 11702.42s]  Let me see it. Title does not
[11702.42s -> 11705.69s]  need... Alright, I'm just gonna find
[11705.69s -> 11708.63s]  it. How do I cap my frame rate?
[11708.63s -> 11716.12s]  If I get it first try, after this I'm
[11716.12s -> 11721.24s]  gonna laugh my ass off.
[11721.24s -> 11728.54s]  Cap frame rate. Frame
[11728.54s -> 11733.58s]  limiter. Okay?
[11733.58s -> 11735.58s]  I can't seem to find the frame limiter for
[11735.58s -> 11737.58s]  this. Can somebody tell me? It doesn't exist.
[11737.58s -> 11741.74s]  Feature was changed to
[11741.74s -> 11743.74s]  speed limit. Speed limit.
[11743.74s -> 11747.26s]  Okay? Look at the speed
[11747.26s -> 11749.26s]  limit. Speed limit! There it is!
[11749.26s -> 11751.26s]  Alright, so it would be 50%.
[11751.26s -> 11754.14s]  That would be 30 FPS, right?
[11754.14s -> 11763.99s]  Is this the game I'm supposed to run?
[11763.99s -> 11771.10s]  Uh, I think this just
[11771.10s -> 11775.58s]  put it into slow motion.
[11800.46s -> 11802.46s]  Hold on a minute. I...
[11802.46s -> 11808.15s]  I'll get it.
[11836.87s -> 11838.87s]  I can't even do it at 30% speed!
[11838.87s -> 11848.73s]  Oh my god!
[11848.73s -> 11864.73s]  A bunch of drugs.
[11864.73s -> 11878.87s]  You piece of shit!
[11878.87s -> 11887.38s]  What the fuck?
[11887.38s -> 11942.86s]  I'm gonna get it! Get in there.
[11942.86s -> 11944.86s]  Don't go over the edge, little
[11944.86s -> 11946.86s]  guy! No!
[11946.86s -> 11980.07s]  Like, why?
[11980.07s -> 11994.79s]  I'll get it at 50%. I almost had
[11994.79s -> 12005.35s]  it last time. Give me the controller.
[12005.35s -> 12007.35s]  Actually, controller issue. What?
[12007.35s -> 12011.19s]  Read this. Read this. Read. Check. Wait. Wait.
[12011.19s -> 12013.19s]  Read this. Check your modular trombulation.
[12013.19s -> 12015.19s]  Your anti-aliasing is blasted.
[12015.19s -> 12017.19s]  What? Read this. Don't change
[12017.19s -> 12019.19s]  the frame rate. Turn against the
[12019.19s -> 12021.19s]  platform when it tilts. You keep trying to stay
[12021.19s -> 12023.19s]  on the edge the whole time
[12023.19s -> 12025.19s]  and that's why you're falling off. Go to the
[12025.19s -> 12027.19s]  falling side and then ramp back up.
[12027.19s -> 12065.77s]  Alright. Guys!
[12065.77s -> 12068.01s]  Guys! Guys!
[12068.01s -> 12070.01s]  I have to pull a plug. I have to rip the cord
[12070.01s -> 12072.01s]  out. I can't. What am I gonna do this
[12072.01s -> 12083.02s]  all day? You're gonna watch.
[12083.02s -> 12085.96s]  Watch. Watch. Watch. Watch. Watch. Watch. Watch this.
[12085.96s -> 12088.84s]  Watch this. Watch this.
[12088.84s -> 12090.84s]  Irma's Game Cubes. What?
[12090.84s -> 12093.85s]  Oh, okay. Hold on. Let me try one more time.
[12093.85s -> 12102.55s]  Fuck you!
[12102.55s -> 12107.93s]  Please. Please. Please. I'm too-
[12107.93s -> 12111.58s]  The chat is going so fast.
[12111.58s -> 12114.90s]  Sopranos, but-
[12114.90s -> 12116.90s]  It didn't help me.
[12116.90s -> 12119.14s]  It didn't help me. At all.
[12119.14s -> 12121.14s]  Actually. That was the worst-
[12121.14s -> 12146.74s]  That was the least thing that I needed.
[12146.74s -> 12156.34s]  Do it! Please read!
[12156.34s -> 12158.34s]  Tilt to the jump till you
[12158.34s -> 12160.34s]  kick smooth. The north?
[12160.34s -> 12179.34s]  What?
[12179.34s -> 12181.34s]  Watching paint dry. I'm- I'm sorry.
[12181.34s -> 12183.34s]  Trust me. I know. I'm trying to get
[12183.34s -> 12191.59s]  through this. It's tilting and it don't do
[12191.59s -> 12203.24s]  anything, man. Super Monkey Ball.
[12203.24s -> 12206.70s]  Wait. Turn this off or turn this
[12206.70s -> 12211.43s]  down. I need to hear this. Shut this
[12211.43s -> 12214.44s]  off. Somebody has an actual tutorial
[12214.44s -> 12221.80s]  for me. What does it say?
[12225.80s -> 12227.80s]  Cool.
[12227.80s -> 12229.80s]  Please.
[12231.80s -> 12233.80s]  A lot of people make
[12233.80s -> 12235.80s]  their, like, first major mistake is they don't
[12235.80s -> 12237.80s]  pick the right monkey. You need to pick the
[12237.80s -> 12239.80s]  stinky monkey.
[12239.80s -> 12242.36s]  Uh-oh. Stink?
[12242.36s -> 12245.18s]  You fucking
[12245.18s -> 12258.87s]  dick.
[12258.87s -> 12260.87s]  You just made this video.
[12260.87s -> 12264.07s]  Didn't you?
[12264.07s -> 12266.07s]  Hey guys. It's a stavedate from the
[12266.07s -> 12268.07s]  speedrun forums. His name is
[12268.07s -> 12270.07s]  stavedate. Dave state?
[12270.07s -> 12273.14s]  Beginner strats for floor 18.
[12273.14s -> 12275.14s]  So the main thing I see a lot of people
[12275.14s -> 12277.70s]  make their, like, first major
[12277.70s -> 12279.70s]  mistake is they don't pick the right monkey.
[12279.70s -> 12281.70s]  You need to pick the stinky monkey.
[12281.70s -> 12296.22s]  Uh-oh. I need- because somebody please
[12296.22s -> 12298.22s]  tell me how to do it. Like, somebody help me. Please.
[12298.22s -> 12301.86s]  Somebody help me. I want a real tutorial.
[12301.86s -> 12305.26s]  Make one.
[12305.26s -> 12312.81s]  Give me a frame by frame. This is
[12312.81s -> 12315.05s]  expert-
[12315.05s -> 12320.87s]  Okay, hold on. Pick the stinky monkey.
[12320.87s -> 12324.84s]  Let's watch this for a second.
[12324.84s -> 12331.86s]  All the way to the right.
[12331.86s -> 12333.86s]  That's the shit that I'm doing right there, man.
[12333.86s -> 12335.86s]  I'm doing that already.
[12335.86s -> 12337.86s]  He's getting really-
[12337.86s -> 12339.86s]  Okay, alright, alright. He gets all the way to top.
[12339.86s -> 12343.06s]  Like, he's gonna fall the fuck out.
[12343.06s -> 12348.95s]  Shit, this guy's good!
[12348.95s -> 12350.95s]  Holy shit, this guy's
[12350.95s -> 12358.57s]  really good. Hold on.
[12358.57s -> 12360.57s]  I'm so good, actually, now that I'm not
[12360.57s -> 12372.47s]  so good.
[12372.47s -> 12376.42s]  Okay. So, he-
[12376.42s -> 12382.63s]  Volume back up. Okay.
[12382.63s -> 12384.63s]  So he goes bang. He goes right all the way
[12384.63s -> 12389.61s]  to the edge. Just follow.
[12389.61s -> 12391.85s]  T-A-S. T-A-S.
[12391.85s -> 12393.85s]  I thought you were saying T-O-S. Like,
[12393.85s -> 12395.85s]  my dick was on camera. I was like, what the hell are you talking about?
[12395.85s -> 12398.15s]  Alright, I didn't do it. I'll get it.
[12398.15s -> 12415.43s]  T-A-T-T-
[12415.43s -> 12417.43s]  It's tool-assisted.
[12417.43s -> 12419.43s]  Whatever. It's still possible.
[12419.43s -> 12424.23s]  That's not a real person.
[12424.23s -> 12426.73s]  Whatever. It's still possible.
[12426.73s -> 12428.73s]  I can still do that.
[12428.73s -> 12441.72s]  Shit. That was kinda close.
[12444.34s -> 12457.58s]  Shit!
[12464.34s -> 12466.34s]  I believe you can beat this level.
[12466.34s -> 12468.34s]  I'm gonna try, man!
[12468.34s -> 12472.44s]  Do it! Fuck you!
[12472.44s -> 12477.03s]  This is embarrassing.
[12477.03s -> 12479.03s]  No, it's hard. It's really hard.
[12479.03s -> 12484.54s]  Here. I made this
[12484.54s -> 12486.54s]  for you. Okay, here's- let me see.
[12486.54s -> 12488.54s]  Level 18.
[12488.54s -> 12490.54s]  Expert tutorial. Simple.
[12490.54s -> 12492.54s]  It's part with extra reverb.
[12492.54s -> 12494.54s]  Thanks for making me open a bunch of tabs that I don't want.
[12497.67s -> 12504.95s]  Come on, man.
[12508.47s -> 12517.16s]  Man. It's right there.
[12517.16s -> 12542.31s]  It's so funny, cause that's like the
[12542.31s -> 12544.31s]  Just Do It meme, but I guarantee you
[12544.31s -> 12546.31s]  there are people that are sitting there watching this right now
[12546.31s -> 12548.31s]  just actually screamed at me.
[12548.31s -> 12552.28s]  That angry, too.
[12552.28s -> 12554.28s]  Like that upset.
[12554.28s -> 12565.14s]  Help me. Help me.
[12565.14s -> 12567.32s]  Help me, please.
[12567.32s -> 12569.32s]  I need help. I can't
[12569.32s -> 12571.32s]  be defeated by this. I can't.
[12571.32s -> 12573.32s]  I can't be defeated by this. It's too sad. I need to beat this.
[12577.91s -> 12579.91s]  This guy sucks. No!
[12579.91s -> 12581.91s]  Stop! I don't- do I?
[12581.91s -> 12583.91s]  I got maybe a little.
[12583.91s -> 12585.91s]  Fuck.
[12588.28s -> 12590.28s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Read this.
[12590.28s -> 12593.42s]  Be in the middle when it's tilting against you.
[12593.42s -> 12595.42s]  Tilt to the higher side.
[12595.42s -> 12597.42s]  I tried that.
[12597.42s -> 12601.70s]  I tried that already.
[12601.70s -> 12607.34s]  Why does this look like a different game?
[12607.34s -> 12613.42s]  Swing bar?
[12613.42s -> 12615.85s]  Is this the right game?
[12615.85s -> 12617.85s]  Is this a different game?
[12617.85s -> 12629.80s]  Is this the right one?
[12629.80s -> 12637.48s]  My claw doesn't look like that.
[12637.48s -> 12641.64s]  This is a different fucking game, man.
[12641.64s -> 12643.64s]  Stay in the middle, idiot. I'm- all right, look!
[12643.64s -> 12648.57s]  You can't
[12648.57s -> 12650.57s]  stay in the middle, guys.
[12650.57s -> 12652.57s]  You have to be going really fast.
[12652.57s -> 12674.57s]  You can't stay in the middle.
[12674.57s -> 12685.51s]  God damn, I almost TAS'd it.
[12685.51s -> 12687.51s]  I ran as little as possible. I'm trying.
[12687.51s -> 12694.30s]  It's a waste to gain speed.
[12694.30s -> 12707.93s]  I just went to the clock.
[12707.93s -> 12710.23s]  Oh my god. It's been like
[12710.23s -> 12721.30s]  45 minutes.
[12721.30s -> 12723.30s]  In some of the videos, people are leading this to use
[12723.30s -> 12725.30s]  the big monkey. I think you need to change.
[12725.30s -> 12735.98s]  Suck up! What's the monkey ball?
[12736.98s -> 12741.06s]  Okay. Here we go.
[12741.06s -> 12743.49s]  This is an actual video.
[12743.49s -> 12745.49s]  It looks like a real video.
[12745.49s -> 12747.49s]  It was uploaded like five years ago.
[12747.49s -> 12749.49s]  This is not somebody fucking around.
[12749.49s -> 12762.34s]  Let's see.
[12776.34s -> 12778.34s]  That's what I'm doing!
[12784.18s -> 12786.18s]  Isn't that what I'm trying to do already?
[12786.18s -> 12788.18s]  This is a text tutorial.
[12788.18s -> 12790.18s]  Make your way as fast as you can
[12790.18s -> 12792.18s]  across the bridge and hold the uphill
[12792.18s -> 12800.38s]  direction whenever necessary.
[12800.38s -> 12803.83s]  Great advice.
[12803.83s -> 12805.83s]  Momentum glitch, level 18.
[12805.83s -> 12807.83s]  Monkey's in a circle, okay, whatever.
[12807.83s -> 12810.65s]  I'm doing everything that I'm- all right, I'm gonna turn the music off.
[12810.65s -> 12819.16s]  I'm just gonna try it like this.
[12819.16s -> 12826.20s]  The only thing you have to do here is tilt
[12826.20s -> 12829.34s]  to the side when it tilts to the side.
[12829.34s -> 12831.34s]  Okay.
[12831.34s -> 12838.76s]  Okay.
[12838.76s -> 12840.76s]  Hold right to the side when it tilts to the side.
[12840.76s -> 12843.13s]  Except that doesn't work.
[12843.13s -> 12846.97s]  I'm holding right right now.
[12846.97s -> 12848.97s]  And it doesn't do anything, man.
[12848.97s -> 12855.62s]  Before it tilts.
[12855.62s -> 12857.86s]  That's what I'm doing.
[12857.86s -> 12859.86s]  Holding left, tilting. All right.
[12859.86s -> 12863.06s]  I'm not doing anything.
[12863.06s -> 12865.06s]  Forward right, forward left, forward right, forward left.
[12865.06s -> 12867.50s]  I'm about to put on a hand cam.
[12867.50s -> 12878.76s]  So you can see what's happening.
[12878.76s -> 12880.76s]  I'm convinced he's doing this wrong.
[12880.76s -> 12882.76s]  You can't be convinced! No, I don't want to show you my controller.
[12882.76s -> 12890.04s]  It's got a bunch of dirt all over it.
[12890.04s -> 12892.04s]  It has inputs on the screen. Yeah, I know.
[12892.04s -> 12896.52s]  I can't believe Sony made that fucking video.
[12896.52s -> 12899.08s]  That's so funny.
[12899.08s -> 12907.21s]  Money monkey gif. 100 gecs?
[12907.21s -> 12921.54s]  That was it. That was it.
[12921.54s -> 12923.98s]  Everybody relax. Nobody move.
[12923.98s -> 12925.98s]  I don't want anybody to move. Don't fucking move.
[12925.98s -> 12948.17s]  Shit!
[12948.17s -> 12950.60s]  Fellas! Boys and girls, he did it!
[12950.60s -> 12967.48s]  Okay, so like I look-
[12967.48s -> 12969.48s]  Clementines are so much easier to eat than oranges.
[12969.48s -> 12971.66s]  You know what I mean? Like-
[12971.66s -> 12973.66s]  Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12973.66s -> 12992.09s]  I have to do this? Please.
[12992.09s -> 12994.65s]  What are you doing, man?
[12994.65s -> 13001.05s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[13001.05s -> 13003.05s]  What's that record on that level? What's the record on that level?
[13003.05s -> 13005.05s]  I want it. What's the world record on that level without
[13005.05s -> 13009.40s]  current terms assisted bots?
[13009.40s -> 13035.00s]  I want to know what it is.
[13035.00s -> 13045.69s]  18 left. Actual world record.
[13045.69s -> 13049.59s]  No.
[13049.59s -> 13062.20s]  Was it? I don't know. Could have been.
[13062.20s -> 13065.53s]  Welcome to the next hour.
[13065.53s -> 13071.02s]  Wait a minute.
[13071.02s -> 13073.26s]  I missed the world record
[13073.26s -> 13075.26s]  by 0
[13075.26s -> 13077.26s]  by 0.02
[13077.26s -> 13083.40s]  seconds. Did I?
[13083.40s -> 13095.16s]  Shit. Alright, this one is
[13095.16s -> 13097.16s]  all over the place. So you're going to go run,
[13097.16s -> 13099.16s]  left, run, right. No you don't. Just run right
[13099.16s -> 13104.86s]  down the middle. Okay.
[13104.86s -> 13111.00s]  Weird. Is this an illusion?
[13111.00s -> 13113.00s]  It's kind of just an optical illusion.
[13113.00s -> 13148.97s]  Wrong monkey.
[13148.97s -> 13159.34s]  I get it. You have to-
[13159.34s -> 13161.34s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. I know what you
[13161.34s -> 13164.92s]  have to do. You have to-
[13164.92s -> 13173.69s]  This is gonna suck ass.
[13173.69s -> 13175.69s]  It's gonna be hard, but you gotta just keep it right on the edge,
[13175.69s -> 13177.69s]  right on the edge, right on the edge.
[13177.69s -> 13198.98s]  Fuck you.
[13198.98s -> 13202.36s]  Edgy. Yes.
[13202.36s -> 13204.36s]  That is how you could describe it.
[13204.36s -> 13219.34s]  Why did you read that?
[13221.51s -> 13228.94s]  You know what that means.
[13228.94s -> 13236.09s]  Let's move on from that one. Pretending?
[13236.09s -> 13238.58s]  Yes.
[13238.58s -> 13240.58s]  Let's make it a clean yes.
[13240.58s -> 13256.06s]  Stupid.
[13256.06s -> 13258.06s]  Why am I? I'm addicted to this game now.
[13258.06s -> 13260.42s]  Once I overcame
[13260.42s -> 13262.42s]  tilt level, now I can't stop.
[13262.42s -> 13264.42s]  How many more levels are there?
[13264.42s -> 13266.42s]  Like, 30? Great.
[13266.42s -> 13269.11s]  I definitely will not get through this.
[13269.11s -> 13299.13s]  Even with cheating.
[13299.13s -> 13307.26s]  It's gonna be- Fucking idiot.
[13307.26s -> 13318.07s]  That's so annoying.
[13318.07s -> 13337.21s]  It makes it harder somehow.
[13337.21s -> 13341.94s]  That's gonna be way worse.
[13341.94s -> 13353.91s]  Remember, please wake up. We miss you.
[13353.91s -> 13357.88s]  It actually- You know what?
[13357.88s -> 13362.86s]  We just need it to be slower.
[13362.86s -> 13395.82s]  Fucking game, man.
[13395.82s -> 13398.12s]  This fucking game.
[13411.56s -> 13421.86s]  Ooh, this one's Sega.
[13421.86s -> 13436.07s]  World record.
[13436.07s -> 13438.07s]  I guess the time would be the same, right?
[13438.07s -> 13440.95s]  The time would be a record, but-
[13440.95s -> 13452.15s]  How do they miss that shit?
[13452.15s -> 13459.83s]  Talk slowly?
[13459.83s -> 13462.07s]  Make it seem- Hold on.
[13462.07s -> 13476.98s]  Super Monkey Ball!
[13476.98s -> 13478.98s]  Alright, so if I go this way.
[13489.27s -> 13494.46s]  I think I'll be okay.
[13494.46s -> 13497.34s]  I- I hit my head though, that sucks.
[13497.34s -> 13500.54s]  You can try it again, though.
[13500.54s -> 13506.30s]  The game's kind of fun.
[13506.30s -> 13508.30s]  I mean, two is probably-
[13508.30s -> 13511.05s]  People said two is gonna be better than one.
[13511.05s -> 13514.31s]  That makes sense, I guess.
[13529.56s -> 13531.56s]  I fell down again. Fuck.
[13531.56s -> 13536.36s]  I'm not very good, but
[13536.36s -> 13538.36s]  the games have their strengths and weaknesses, so.
[13538.36s -> 13541.18s]  One is more puzzle-oriented.
[13541.18s -> 13543.18s]  Two is more slide-oriented.
[13543.18s -> 13554.18s]  What's supposed to happen?
[13554.18s -> 13560.84s]  Well, I can tell you this is not supposed to happen.
[13560.84s -> 13564.10s]  It's not actually happening. Alright, stop fucking around.
[13564.10s -> 13567.50s]  This one's more Dave-oriented, yeah.
[13567.50s -> 13581.90s]  Why do they think I could do that?
[13581.90s -> 13588.04s]  One is more shitty-oriented.
[13588.04s -> 13590.04s]  Two is more puzzle-oriented.
[13590.04s -> 13594.78s]  There are a lot of Super Monkey Ball
[13594.78s -> 13596.78s]  original haters in here today.
[13596.78s -> 13600.81s]  I've noticed that.
[13600.81s -> 13602.81s]  There's quite a few of you guys. Is it really that-
[13602.81s -> 13606.26s]  Is it that accurate?
[13606.26s -> 13619.19s]  Should I go fast?
[13619.19s -> 13631.91s]  David.
[13631.91s -> 13638.38s]  Take all games at face value.
[13638.38s -> 13640.38s]  You get to go much faster than this. I don't know.
[13640.38s -> 13657.38s]  How do you get over there?
[13657.38s -> 13674.33s]  Shit, like that. Whoa!
[13674.33s -> 13688.15s]  I'm not soft-locked, I'm fine.
[13688.15s -> 13701.51s]  Shit. Wait, what just happened?
[13701.51s -> 13703.51s]  What happened? What did I just do?
[13703.51s -> 13706.84s]  Is it connected?
[13706.84s -> 13721.56s]  It wasn't connected.
[13721.56s -> 13723.56s]  How do I hop over from here to there?
[13723.56s -> 13738.78s]  Got it.
[13738.78s -> 13740.78s]  This one looks real
[13740.78s -> 13746.66s]  good.
[13746.66s -> 13748.66s]  This one, we can just brute force, I think.
[13748.66s -> 13752.25s]  I would say this one's brute forceable.
[13752.25s -> 13777.70s]  100 Gex.
[13777.70s -> 13780.46s]  Okay, much harder than I thought.
[13792.92s -> 13797.13s]  Unlimited.
[13797.13s -> 13831.75s]  Nobody wrote
[13831.75s -> 13833.75s]  Ultra Gamer Instinct.
[13833.75s -> 13839.51s]  It's like, how does he do it?
[13839.51s -> 13841.51s]  He's a maniac.
[13841.51s -> 13845.29s]  He can do anything. He's so good.
[13845.29s -> 13847.72s]  He's so good.
[13847.72s -> 13858.98s]  Okay, hold on. I have-
[13858.98s -> 13860.98s]  What's the world record for the next level?
[13860.98s -> 13867.75s]  I'm curious. What is it?
[13867.75s -> 13869.75s]  I'm gonna try to get the time world record.
[13869.75s -> 13879.85s]  Uh, what is the record here?
[13879.85s -> 13893.16s]  This one sucks.
[13893.16s -> 13900.20s]  I mean, it kinda looks like it.
[13900.20s -> 13902.82s]  Damn. No one's ever beaten this level.
[13902.82s -> 13909.22s]  Somebody jumps from the corner
[13909.22s -> 13917.29s]  of the map.
[13917.29s -> 13919.29s]  Wait, you have to jump? Like, there?
[13919.29s -> 13922.74s]  Alright, maybe not this one.
[13922.74s -> 13924.74s]  One that's way more complicated,
[13924.74s -> 13926.74s]  that's really hard.
[13926.74s -> 13931.16s]  That takes a ton of patience.
[13931.16s -> 13933.16s]  Okay, that turn is hard as shit.
[13933.16s -> 13942.81s]  It could be this one.
[13942.81s -> 13945.94s]  Really sharp right turn.
[13945.94s -> 13956.76s]  Don't be deceived.
[13956.76s -> 13958.76s]  This is not too bad, although I say that now.
[13958.76s -> 13961.96s]  Why does this one suck?
[13961.96s -> 13963.96s]  Everyone was saying, this one sucks, this one sucks, this one sucks.
[13963.96s -> 13965.96s]  Why? I mean, I'm just a fucking idiot.
[13965.96s -> 13984.65s]  That's why I fell off. That has nothing to do with how hard the level is.
[13984.65s -> 13986.65s]  It's just boring.
[13986.65s -> 13990.04s]  Yeah, I guess it kind of is.
[13990.04s -> 13998.49s]  Just go right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[13998.49s -> 14014.15s]  Uh, shit.
[14014.15s -> 14018.57s]  Time. Running out of time, running out of time.
[14018.57s -> 14026.44s]  Holy shit, you have to do this
[14026.44s -> 14028.44s]  so fast. You have to do this SO fast.
[14028.44s -> 14064.01s]  Even with the fucking cheating.
[14064.01s -> 14067.21s]  Admit it, he admits it.
[14067.21s -> 14069.21s]  Yeah, what do you think? My computer's broken?
[14069.21s -> 14076.89s]  I'm going way too fast.
[14076.89s -> 14086.04s]  Alright, I'm gonna do, I'm gonna just be
[14086.04s -> 14088.04s]  5% faster than I was last time.
[14088.04s -> 14091.37s]  I can do that when the speed is slower.
[14091.37s -> 14096.74s]  Take it slow, I'll be good.
[14096.74s -> 14100.20s]  I have way more reaction time.
[14100.20s -> 14109.61s]  And I fucking fell off. I knew it was gonna fucking happen.
[14109.61s -> 14111.61s]  I knew it was gonna fucking happen.
[14111.61s -> 14113.61s]  I knew it. I'm just gonna start save-stating. Fuck this level. This place sucks.
[14113.61s -> 14127.05s]  I just looked at chat. I just read chat for no reason.
[14127.05s -> 14129.05s]  Why did I do that?
[14129.05s -> 14155.08s]  Oh shit, leaked!
[14155.08s -> 14165.56s]  Get that off the screen!
[14165.56s -> 14176.76s]  Get that off the fucking screen, mate!
[14176.76s -> 14185.85s]  What are you fucking doing?
[14185.85s -> 14188.79s]  Bad world.
[14188.79s -> 14190.79s]  It's not even, why would I want to take that window?
[14190.79s -> 14194.06s]  It won't take this other window now.
[14194.06s -> 14207.50s]  Why?
[14207.50s -> 14213.64s]  Oh fuck, that game starts.
[14213.64s -> 14216.65s]  Okay, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14216.65s -> 14218.65s]  Okay, look, we already went over this.
[14218.65s -> 14220.65s]  That was just, that was a screenshot for Dave.
[14220.65s -> 14223.02s]  He wanted me to take a screenshot.
[14223.02s -> 14225.02s]  You know, that was a screenshot
[14225.02s -> 14227.02s]  from Dave to me.
[14227.02s -> 14229.02s]  He's like, dude, hey, these are my list of things that I'm trying to get to work.
[14229.02s -> 14231.02s]  Can you help me?
[14231.02s -> 14233.02s]  I'm like, alright, man, like I will eventually. Maybe like a little later or something.
[14233.02s -> 14236.22s]  I don't know.
[14236.22s -> 14238.22s]  That was a screenshot from Dave to me.
[14238.22s -> 14240.52s]  Don't fucking leak it again.
[14240.52s -> 14257.78s]  My computer crashed. Leaked.
[14257.78s -> 14259.78s]  Where does this press play on mad world right now?
[14259.78s -> 14264.31s]  No.
[14264.31s -> 14266.31s]  There's a disc right behind me. I got
[14266.31s -> 14268.31s]  the controller, I got the system, and I, you know, I can
[14268.31s -> 14270.31s]  my, I, uh,
[14270.31s -> 14272.31s]  look, I own everything.
[14272.31s -> 14274.31s]  I own them all. I own everything.
[14274.31s -> 14276.31s]  They're in the house right now. They're right behind me.
[14276.31s -> 14296.47s]  I don't, what's with like the weird dust filter
[14296.47s -> 14298.47s]  that's on this? I don't like that.
[14298.47s -> 14305.06s]  I just have to get up there with an extra
[14305.06s -> 14309.54s]  five seconds left.
[14309.54s -> 14311.54s]  Man, I don't know much more. This shit I can take.
[14311.54s -> 14322.04s]  Bunker S. What?
[14322.04s -> 14325.67s]  What'd I say?
[14325.67s -> 14340.97s]  What'd I say? What'd I do?
[14340.97s -> 14348.84s]  Fucking hard turns, dude.
[14348.84s -> 14363.11s]  Oh, come on, man. Fuck this.
[14363.11s -> 14365.11s]  Oh, fuck this. Screw this. Fuck this game. Fuck this level.
[14365.11s -> 14367.11s]  Still here.
[14367.11s -> 14383.03s]  I'm still playing it. Whatever.
[14383.03s -> 14387.96s]  Oh.
[14387.96s -> 14389.96s]  What?
[14389.96s -> 14391.96s]  I just don't wanna. I don't wanna.
[14391.96s -> 14398.55s]  I have to put it on slow motion.
[14398.55s -> 14402.78s]  It's the only way I'm gonna do it.
[14402.78s -> 14404.78s]  It's the only way it's gonna happen. I'm sorry, everybody.
[14404.78s -> 14407.08s]  I'm sorry.
[14407.08s -> 14417.50s]  This has to happen.
[14417.50s -> 14430.49s]  I apologize.
[14430.49s -> 14432.49s]  The original game does not have slow motion.
[14432.49s -> 14440.47s]  Yeah, well, you didn't get
[14440.47s -> 14442.47s]  you a copy from a guy like that in the back
[14442.47s -> 14446.38s]  of his van. It was burned
[14446.38s -> 14453.74s]  onto a CD-R.
[14453.74s -> 14455.74s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[14455.74s -> 14467.38s]  You talk a lot of
[14467.38s -> 14481.08s]  bad game for a little guy.
[14481.08s -> 14483.08s]  How can I still screw this up?
[14483.08s -> 14486.73s]  Actual worst voice?
[14486.73s -> 14488.73s]  Isn't that what it was? Doesn't know what it does.
[14488.73s -> 14490.73s]  It's like, you talk a lot. Yeah.
[14490.73s -> 14493.67s]  Except people are giving me money.
[14493.67s -> 14508.20s]  Captain Squiggle, thanks for the ten
[14508.20s -> 14511.08s]  good meter days sub. Thanks, though.
[14511.08s -> 14517.22s]  Seriously. I do it every time
[14517.22s -> 14519.22s]  even in slow motion. I fucking swear to God.
[14519.22s -> 14521.85s]  I'm about to rip the game up. I'm about to pull the game out of the
[14521.85s -> 14527.35s]  theoretical GameCube.
[14527.35s -> 14529.35s]  Theoretically pulling the disc out of the GameCube
[14529.35s -> 14535.18s]  tray in my mind. What's a good
[14535.18s -> 14537.18s]  speed to do? Like 20 miles per hour? I think
[14537.18s -> 14539.18s]  20 is good. I can take corners
[14539.18s -> 14550.89s]  easier that way. If I stay at
[14550.89s -> 14567.32s]  20, we're good.
[14567.32s -> 14569.32s]  You're gonna stop underclocking
[14569.32s -> 14578.47s]  your GameCube. Dude.
[14578.47s -> 14581.93s]  Stay at 20.
[14581.93s -> 14593.32s]  Stop reading chat. Finish the level. I am.
[14593.32s -> 14608.86s]  You talk a lot of
[14608.86s -> 14611.72s]  bad game.
[14611.72s -> 14613.72s]  I'm so
[14613.72s -> 14617.69s]  so fucked up right now.
[14617.69s -> 14619.69s]  Dude, stop. I'm not doing anything. I'm just
[14619.69s -> 14622.12s]  fucking saying a word.
[14622.12s -> 14624.12s]  Can I say, oh, you talk a lot of
[14624.12s -> 14626.55s]  big game. Just as me?
[14626.55s -> 14628.55s]  Or is that off limits forever
[14628.55s -> 14648.20s]  now? Is this, am I even
[14648.20s -> 14650.20s]  still gonna actually be able to finish this?
[14650.20s -> 14653.34s]  Even with the super slow motion
[14653.34s -> 14664.98s]  going like 20? It's gonna be close.
[14664.98s -> 14671.58s]  I might get it. That turn.
[14671.58s -> 14673.82s]  Alright, then we're gonna full
[14673.82s -> 14675.82s]  blast here and then full blast here. No, I definitely
[14675.82s -> 14698.01s]  have it. Full blast.
[14698.01s -> 14700.63s]  Five, four, don't go
[14700.63s -> 14704.22s]  that fast. Still have to go through the
[14704.22s -> 14715.42s]  gate.
[14715.42s -> 14718.49s]  Doesn't it feel weird? Feels like the game's
[14718.49s -> 14725.59s]  wrong. This one's cool.
[14725.59s -> 14731.27s]  This one's cool. I like this one. I gotta do Tony Hawk
[14731.27s -> 14749.56s]  Momentum. Cool.
[14749.56s -> 14752.12s]  That one was just fun.
[14752.12s -> 14754.12s]  That one doesn't belong in expert. That one was just
[14754.12s -> 14760.07s]  fun. This is a Mario Sunshine
[14760.07s -> 14762.07s]  bonus level. I already hate it.
[14762.07s -> 14787.27s]  Okay. Holy shit.
[14787.27s -> 14789.27s]  The end is right there. Did I miss it?
[14789.27s -> 14803.42s]  That actually would have been pretty awesome.
[14803.42s -> 14826.31s]  Holy shit. I can get it.
[14826.31s -> 14828.31s]  Easy, easy. Slow, slow, slow, slow. Don't go
[14828.31s -> 14832.52s]  fast. Unnecessary.
[14832.52s -> 14834.52s]  I bounced so high.
[14834.52s -> 14849.43s]  Stupid asshole.
[14849.43s -> 14854.68s]  We can't cheat on every single level.
[14854.68s -> 14861.08s]  Not you. I'm not talking about you guys.
[14861.08s -> 14876.12s]  These are not as hard as the other ones
[14876.12s -> 14882.07s]  were. They really aren't.
[14882.07s -> 14884.07s]  Okay, we're going safe. I don't care about the bananas.
[14884.07s -> 14892.71s]  This is gonna be horrible.
[14892.71s -> 14896.23s]  Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible.
[14896.23s -> 14904.62s]  Is this other side
[14904.62s -> 14909.10s]  better somehow?
[14909.10s -> 14926.87s]  Kind of. Slow down.
[14926.87s -> 14928.87s]  He's still playing this. Yeah.
[14928.87s -> 14952.94s]  Damn it. I couldn't put my hand
[14952.94s -> 14977.90s]  on F1 fast enough.
[14977.90s -> 14979.90s]  Jesus, man. What the fuck.
[14979.90s -> 14989.37s]  I almost just did it. I almost just pressed it. Thank
[14989.37s -> 14991.37s]  God I didn't. I pressed 1 instead of F1.
[14991.37s -> 15009.48s]  This is dumb.
[15009.48s -> 15034.68s]  No. Thank God.
[15034.68s -> 15047.61s]  You know, when this stream first started
[15047.61s -> 15049.61s]  I really, really thought you guys were just like
[15049.61s -> 15052.42s]  messing around. There was no way
[15052.42s -> 15055.43s]  he was going to beat this.
[15055.43s -> 15057.43s]  Like, not a single
[15057.43s -> 15059.86s]  solitary chance in hell.
[15059.86s -> 15061.86s]  I'm like, what? It's Monkey Ball.
[15061.86s -> 15063.86s]  This game's on iPad.
[15063.86s -> 15073.38s]  I had no fucking idea.
[15073.38s -> 15079.91s]  You're literally cheating.
[15079.91s -> 15081.91s]  I'm not saying this is a victory.
[15081.91s -> 15109.99s]  Wait, what?
[15109.99s -> 15111.99s]  What? Come on. I hit
[15111.99s -> 15128.57s]  the goal post?
[15128.57s -> 15131.13s]  What's wrong with my mic? I probably
[15131.13s -> 15153.21s]  fucked it up or something. Yeah.
[15153.21s -> 15155.21s]  What's the, hey, what's the world record on that one?
[15155.21s -> 15179.90s]  What's the world record on that one? Dude.
[15179.90s -> 15183.29s]  What the hell do I do here?
[15183.29s -> 15188.98s]  I gotta watch. Okay, this is gonna be
[15188.98s -> 15204.52s]  horrible. Okay.
[15204.52s -> 15206.82s]  Nope. No way. No way. You gotta stay on there.
[15206.82s -> 15220.06s]  Wait, it turns on?
[15220.06s -> 15222.06s]  Sometimes, wait. What is
[15222.06s -> 15241.62s]  going on here? Dude. I
[15241.62s -> 15243.62s]  don't, dude, I don't think this is
[15243.62s -> 15258.26s]  Oh no!
[15258.26s -> 15272.28s]  Alright, we're good. What? Did I hit
[15272.28s -> 15274.28s]  F1? What did I press?
[15274.28s -> 15276.28s]  I don't know what I pressed.
[15276.28s -> 15278.28s]  I pressed caps lock.
[15278.28s -> 15304.44s]  Wait. It's okay. It's alright.
[15304.44s -> 15306.81s]  It's okay. It's crashed, but we're good.
[15306.81s -> 15310.06s]  Okay. We're good. We're in a good spot.
[15310.06s -> 15314.09s]  I can't imagine playing this
[15314.09s -> 15317.74s]  legit. I'm enjoying this game solely
[15317.74s -> 15329.06s]  because I'm able to do this. The game crashed?
[15329.06s -> 15331.69s]  Yeah, I remember the GameCube games back in the
[15331.69s -> 15333.69s]  day. Yeah, they just crashed all the fucking time.
[15333.69s -> 15336.12s]  I fucked up, whatever.
[15336.12s -> 15338.55s]  That's why I lost the console war.
[15338.55s -> 15355.88s]  Good. Alright, we're on floor
[15355.88s -> 15362.15s]  30. Simple bonus floor.
[15362.15s -> 15371.75s]  Only, yeah, only 20 more
[15371.75s -> 15374.57s]  to go. I'll be surprised if I even get through
[15374.57s -> 15377.06s]  the next 10, let alone the next 5.
[15377.06s -> 15387.50s]  Floor 31.
[15387.50s -> 15395.11s]  Is there ice in this game?
[15395.11s -> 15405.03s]  Am I waiting for something in particular
[15405.03s -> 15415.72s]  or...not that bad.
[15415.72s -> 15437.91s]  This looks pretty bad.
[15437.91s -> 15441.37s]  I need to go that fast.
[15441.37s -> 15443.37s]  This is bad.
[15443.37s -> 15459.62s]  Is this ice?
[15459.62s -> 15474.47s]  Okay, I'll be honest with you.
[15474.47s -> 15478.57s]  I was just looking down at my chest.
[15478.57s -> 15526.31s]  I don't know why. I just looked at it.
[15526.31s -> 15528.31s]  Why?
[15528.31s -> 15532.34s]  Good jump spot?
[15532.34s -> 15550.70s]  Just jump. No, fuck it.
[15550.70s -> 15567.59s]  I can't jump. It might be time to turn
[15567.59s -> 15571.11s]  around to Gamer Instinct. It's almost Gamer Instinct
[15571.11s -> 15577.26s]  time. Yeah, it's gonna be Gamer Instinct time
[15577.26s -> 15630.18s]  here.
[15630.18s -> 15637.03s]  Alright, nice.
[15637.03s -> 15644.84s]  Look at how awesome that looked in real time.
[15644.84s -> 15648.68s]  Don't bump into anything. This looks okay.
[15648.68s -> 15655.72s]  Maybe not. Is that how he sees the world?
[15655.72s -> 15666.22s]  How the hell am I gonna do this?
[15666.22s -> 15668.22s]  You have to get tons of speed around here.
[15668.22s -> 15670.22s]  That's it.
[15670.22s -> 15675.66s]  Alright, I get it.
[15675.66s -> 15677.66s]  You just gotta fit inside like you're skiing.
[15677.66s -> 15683.48s]  I mean, that's easier said than done,
[15683.48s -> 15694.94s]  of course, right?
[15694.94s -> 15697.69s]  It's pretty easy, is it?
[15697.69s -> 15737.42s]  What am I doing wrong? Jump at the start.
[15737.42s -> 15744.78s]  Please jump. He didn't.
[15744.78s -> 15752.90s]  I think I can do it. Oh, fucking who cares?
[15752.90s -> 15765.64s]  Just try to do it normally. Get up there!
[15765.64s -> 15768.07s]  Come on! No!
[15768.07s -> 15773.00s]  Please! If you do this,
[15773.00s -> 15775.00s]  I'm gonna gift you 5 billion subs.
[15775.00s -> 15778.58s]  Uh, I don't- That would be
[15778.58s -> 15780.58s]  like- That would be like the entire
[15780.58s -> 15782.58s]  GDP of, like, New
[15782.58s -> 15784.58s]  Hampshire. So, I don't think you have that.
[15784.58s -> 15804.36s]  25 billion dollars
[15804.36s -> 15806.36s]  is the GDP of New Hampshire? I don't- Is it?
[15806.36s -> 15810.14s]  I don't know. It might be. Look it up.
[15810.14s -> 15818.78s]  I feel like it's, like, a small enough state.
[15818.78s -> 15823.56s]  Get up there! This sucks.
[15823.56s -> 15825.56s]  New Hampshire has a 69 billion
[15825.56s -> 15827.56s]  dollar GDP.
[15827.56s -> 15832.94s]  That was close. If you beat this level,
[15832.94s -> 15834.94s]  I will gift you 25 subs. Hold me accountable.
[15834.94s -> 15861.94s]  Okay. Corner. I know, I'm trying to get
[15861.94s -> 15869.05s]  to the corner. Remember, if you beat this level,
[15869.05s -> 15872.50s]  I'll gift you all my Tesla stock.
[15872.50s -> 15890.62s]  I don't- I really want it.
[15890.62s -> 15892.62s]  Oh, dude! That dude's about to give me the entire
[15892.62s -> 15894.62s]  GDP of Canada. I'll take it!
[15894.62s -> 15909.90s]  600 billion?
[15909.90s -> 15911.90s]  Remember, if you beat this first trial, I'll give you fucking 500 bucks.
[15911.90s -> 15913.90s]  Oh, really? Okay, dude! Thanks a lot, man!
[15913.90s -> 15936.42s]  Appreciate the 500 subs!
[15936.42s -> 15938.42s]  This one's gonna be horrible. 5 community subs
[15938.42s -> 15940.42s]  from Ecoleech. That's
[15940.42s -> 15943.62s]  not 500. You don't- Nobody actually
[15943.62s -> 15945.62s]  has to do that. I'm fucking around. Don't feel like
[15945.62s -> 15952.47s]  somebody has to do that. I guess you just have to
[15952.47s -> 15959.45s]  just wait. I'll take the 20.
[15959.45s -> 15961.45s]  Thanks, Goiki, for the 20 community subs.
[15961.45s -> 15964.01s]  I will definitely take them.
[15964.01s -> 15973.98s]  Appreciate it. Thanks a lot.
[15973.98s -> 15977.05s]  We kind of blew through the 30s here.
[15977.05s -> 15998.94s]  I thought I was gonna take way longer than this.
[15998.94s -> 16003.48s]  Eat shit, dude. This one was hard. Eat shit.
[16003.48s -> 16006.81s]  That one was hard. Not you guys
[16006.81s -> 16008.81s]  eat shit. Like, this guy in the
[16008.81s -> 16020.14s]  pamphlet ball. I don't know what just happened,
[16020.14s -> 16024.74s]  but whatever. Okay. All this with
[16024.74s -> 16026.74s]  one life remaining, by the way. I have to be very
[16026.74s -> 16028.74s]  careful that I do not
[16028.74s -> 16030.74s]  accidentally fuck up this save state.
[16030.74s -> 16038.47s]  In fact, shift F2.
[16038.47s -> 16042.31s]  Right? There.
[16042.31s -> 16045.70s]  Okay. Do we get a bounce?
[16045.70s -> 16051.21s]  We just bounce over in the
[16051.21s -> 16055.22s]  game. The game crashed.
[16055.22s -> 16058.55s]  If you could guess. The thing I have
[16058.55s -> 16065.66s]  both those save states, the game just crashed. Cool.
[16065.66s -> 16067.66s]  Remember when I elbow dropped off the top rope
[16067.66s -> 16069.66s]  in one of the Derma Rumbles a couple years ago in the
[16069.66s -> 16071.66s]  PS4, blue screened?
[16071.66s -> 16074.34s]  I was so disappointed. That was one of the worst things
[16074.34s -> 16079.14s]  ever. We had to do the whole Rumble
[16079.14s -> 16081.14s]  again, and it's like, oh, but the
[16081.14s -> 16083.70s]  outcome's gonna be different.
[16083.70s -> 16100.28s]  So bad. Holy shit.
[16100.28s -> 16102.28s]  I just did it. Did I do it?
[16102.28s -> 16104.28s]  I did it fast, but I did too fast.
[16104.28s -> 16108.95s]  That was fast.
[16108.95s -> 16135.35s]  Nope. Take it slow.
[16135.35s -> 16137.35s]  You don't have to be fast, you just have to be right.
[16137.35s -> 16150.84s]  Like that. I feel like I really
[16150.84s -> 16152.84s]  kind of went into a groove here in the 30s.
[16152.84s -> 16167.05s]  I want the camera to be facing this
[16167.05s -> 16175.18s]  way, please. Holy shit, they get smaller.
[16175.18s -> 16190.97s]  Damn.
[16190.97s -> 16192.97s]  Just close your eyes. I'll take
[16192.97s -> 16204.49s]  care of this. All right. Open your eyes. I did it.
[16204.49s -> 16215.67s]  This looks cool.
[16215.67s -> 16221.37s]  Oh, they go. How was I supposed
[16221.37s -> 16224.50s]  to do that? Wait.
[16224.50s -> 16228.90s]  Are they gonna slide behind me?
[16228.90s -> 16233.13s]  Oh. Did they stop?
[16233.13s -> 16236.52s]  No. That was a fun slide
[16236.52s -> 16240.42s]  level. Okay.
[16240.42s -> 16242.66s]  We've made it to the last 10.
[16242.66s -> 16246.25s]  It's 41.
[16246.25s -> 16265.50s]  Almost at it first try. One more.
[16265.50s -> 16277.14s]  That's it? All right. Good. Good.
[16277.14s -> 16281.62s]  Gotta beat the next level without looking. That's not gonna happen.
[16281.62s -> 16289.48s]  Guys.
[16289.48s -> 16307.91s]  One in the middle. Skips.
[16307.91s -> 16314.50s]  Just be slow. What's the rush? There is none.
[16314.50s -> 16328.82s]  We don't even need to skip. Fine.
[16328.82s -> 16351.34s]  Oh, okay. Wait?
[16351.34s -> 16357.53s]  Hurry up, dude. Oh, shit.
[16357.53s -> 16361.18s]  You gotta go fast.
[16361.18s -> 16370.12s]  Really fast.
[16370.12s -> 16383.16s]  Wait, I have an idea. That's gonna work.
[16383.16s -> 16392.95s]  Watch. Never mind.
[16392.95s -> 16410.55s]  Okay. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[16410.55s -> 16429.48s]  Fuck you. Ape Escape is a
[16429.48s -> 16432.23s]  superior primate game. It might be.
[16432.23s -> 16434.23s]  Sure. I'll play it eventually.
[16434.23s -> 16460.38s]  Where is it? Shit.
[16460.38s -> 16468.95s]  What the hell was I doing? You gotta catch it
[16468.95s -> 16470.95s]  right when it comes across.
[16470.95s -> 16472.95s]  One. Two. Three.
[16472.95s -> 16474.95s]  Four. Five.
[16474.95s -> 16477.13s]  One. Two.
[16477.13s -> 16479.30s]  Three. Four. I'm counting
[16479.30s -> 16481.30s]  and looking down. Do I need to look down at my fingers
[16481.30s -> 16483.54s]  to count? What the hell am I
[16483.54s -> 16494.87s]  doing? Game crash.
[16494.87s -> 16499.10s]  And then you go from here to the other one.
[16499.10s -> 16507.22s]  What's going on?
[16507.22s -> 16519.11s]  Am I dumb? Am I dumb?
[16519.11s -> 16527.86s]  Hold on. Wait. I have to
[16527.86s -> 16532.34s]  go on. Go on this one
[16532.34s -> 16534.34s]  and you run just forward. Okay. I get it. I get it.
[16534.34s -> 16547.38s]  I know what to do.
[16549.38s -> 16552.07s]  Oh, this game.
[16552.07s -> 16554.07s]  This fucking game.
[16554.07s -> 16556.07s]  This fucking game.
[16556.07s -> 16570.28s]  Dude, what the fuck?
[16570.28s -> 16575.75s]  Where is it?
[16575.75s -> 16581.96s]  It's like right underneath me.
[16581.96s -> 16588.94s]  I had it too. Fuck you.
[16588.94s -> 16598.47s]  Little bounce.
[16598.47s -> 16600.78s]  Fucking physics. It's stupid.
[16600.78s -> 16602.78s]  This is 2001. Physics didn't even exist yet.
[16602.78s -> 16605.14s]  Why does it keep
[16605.14s -> 16618.90s]  turning me around?
[16618.90s -> 16620.90s]  Gravity didn't exist until 2006. Yeah.
[16620.90s -> 16635.54s]  I know. You get it.
[16635.54s -> 16647.90s]  Does this one work? This one's very easy.
[16647.90s -> 16652.18s]  Is it? Am I overthinking this one?
[16652.18s -> 16662.42s]  Whoa. This one's hard.
[16662.42s -> 16682.38s]  I had it right the first time.
[16682.38s -> 16684.38s]  Blank, blank, blank.
[16684.38s -> 16686.38s]  Blank, blank, blank, blank.
[16686.38s -> 16695.34s]  Blank, blank, blank, blank.
[16695.34s -> 16697.34s]  45, five more. We're getting to the end.
[16697.34s -> 16699.77s]  I'm going to beat this game and
[16699.77s -> 16730.62s]  everyone thought I wasn't going to do it.
[16730.62s -> 16736.70s]  What the fuck am I thinking?
[16736.70s -> 16738.70s]  Save states and slow down. Fake gamer.
[16738.70s -> 16741.51s]  Double fake. Whatever.
[16741.51s -> 16752.52s]  I didn't say I wasn't going to play without a handicap on.
[16752.52s -> 16755.85s]  What was the triple fake?
[16755.85s -> 16764.10s]  It was a triple fake? What was it?
[16764.10s -> 16766.10s]  No, I flew it. I fucking flew it.

[18545.96s -> 18583.98s]  boom strike okay what if I am or instincts don't matter okay gamer sense
[18583.98s -> 18588.96s]  might matter if I do this all the way over here have it go all the way to the
[18588.96s -> 18598.78s]  left tons of power and all the way spin to the left there it is oh that's a
[18598.78s -> 18612.89s]  beauty yes I would have been so cool little less a little bit less we'll go
[18612.89s -> 18630.95s]  all the way over here a little bit less power that's this should do it nice nice
[18630.99s -> 18664.07s]  feel satisfied now we can stop I'm done with this one we got golf number of
[18664.07s -> 18680.06s]  holes whatever 18 holes why would they make 18 holes it's part 3 it's just
[18680.06s -> 18700.53s]  mini golf oh this is awesome why can't I just have played this the whole time
[18700.53s -> 18730.88s]  let me try to get a hole in one and I'll be happy this is cute though this is
[18730.88s -> 18742.00s]  fine this is cute it's cute it's cool okay let's just gonna I'm gonna hit her
[18742.04s -> 18754.30s]  as hard as I possibly can just smash it how many times you do that at mini golf
[18754.30s -> 18761.32s]  by the way I remember going mini golf and then you do it a little too hard and
[18761.32s -> 18765.52s]  it would just bang bang bang bang bang would skip over into maybe another
[18765.52s -> 18770.36s]  family playing and you're like the turquoise ball would just roll down and
[18770.36s -> 18784.06s]  knock into two or three of their balls and ruin their day I was so bad at many
[18784.06s -> 18789.95s]  go if I hated it I always had too hard even if when I I hated it it drove me
[18789.95s -> 18804.31s]  nuts all the one I get a thousand points who hates mini golf it just
[18804.31s -> 18820.08s]  enrages me I don't know why to me it's the worst part about golf dialed up to a
[18820.08s -> 18825.39s]  thousand like hey you know this really difficult really impossible thing that
[18825.39s -> 18832.27s]  takes too much skill to do we're gonna put a windmill in front of you now you
[18832.27s -> 18837.91s]  give me you give me a two wood and driving range I can I could crush those
[18837.91s -> 18858.07s]  balls like happy Gilmore stuff I used to just drill balls at a driving range it
[18858.11s -> 18860.59s]  was such a flex too because you would go there with people that have no idea
[18860.59s -> 18864.43s]  what the hell's going on and they're like doing a weird form and the ball
[18864.43s -> 18868.19s]  rolls down like 20 feet in front of them it's embarrassing I get up there and I'm
[18868.19s -> 18874.88s]  just like these are all going like at least two to three hundred yards I'm
[18874.88s -> 18893.28s]  destroying them but anytime anyone wanted to do like a mini golf was always
[18893.28s -> 18904.40s]  I had something to do sorry I'm baking a cake with my mother I can't or it even
[18904.40s -> 18907.80s]  got to a point I think where I would go but I didn't want to play I wanted to be
[18907.80s -> 18917.15s]  the scorekeeper is after a while becomes a pain in the ass too when you get to
[18917.15s -> 18924.71s]  like hole seven or eight in mini golf aren't you kind of fucking over it like
[18924.71s -> 18932.80s]  an hour or two will go by and it's kind of over this and then you just start
[18932.80s -> 18939.72s]  dragging the ball with your club like oh yeah my turn okay there's like six of
[18939.72s -> 18945.36s]  us here my turn all right well just drag a little bit and let go I don't care
[18945.36s -> 18966.96s]  where it goes you like regular golf I only like the driving part that's it
[18973.56s -> 18989.08s]  I love just smashing balls like a bucket of balls and just watching them soar all
[18989.08s -> 19005.54s]  right that's it I uh that was fun that's where I'm gonna call it so let's go over
[19005.54s -> 19010.28s]  a few things a couple of important things Thursday is the next dream it's
[19010.28s -> 19016.48s]  gonna be left for dead to the big community update Joel be Tyler from

[19058.80s -> 19062.40s]  I maybe I don't think we've locked it down completely yet but it should be a
[19062.40s -> 19067.10s]  lot of fun then what the hell kind of golf course is this we're going full
[19067.14s -> 19075.57s]  power right here what time on Thursday the normal start time like around
[19075.57s -> 19081.93s]  probably around noon there are three other people that we have to kind of
[19081.93s -> 19085.61s]  communicate with those so that could change I would just keep an eye on the
[19085.61s -> 19100.23s]  sus over the next day or so I'll have a locked in time that's gonna be it you

[19294.88s -> 19299.40s]  the thing that happens when you're in last place is toad and all your friends
[19299.40s -> 19303.20s]  are laughing and you get so fucking mad that you just turn around and start
[19303.20s -> 19305.76s]  driving into him it's not even funny you're not making a joke you're actually
[19305.76s -> 19313.10s]  trying to ruin your friends night and eventually gets a point which like dude

[19320.85s -> 19325.90s]  cuz toad is always in last place that's in the game's programming I didn't make
[19325.90s -> 19344.43s]  that game I didn't make told the worst computer control player they did it's
[19344.43s -> 19359.90s]  gonna fun place in my end I was nobody done one lap yet one please go redo
[19359.90s -> 19390.82s]  target and do it right if the press a to fly press a for the speed boost I'll see
[19390.82s -> 19400.93s]  what happens keep it so he made a video with a fake tutorial that's the best
[19400.93s -> 19415.67s]  okay can I nominate that for best one guy moment I thought it was person you

[19439.10s -> 19475.73s]  why do they close it suffocating just like Mario right from aiming for the
[19475.73s -> 19531.46s]  target you have to close it okay I get it right here okay that's 10 maybe 10
[19531.46s -> 19541.96s]  rounds all right if I get it more than 10 right now I the game so I went
[19548.14s -> 19585.94s]  head into the pyramid didn't touch them game not over enough the baby just say
[19585.94s -> 19616.64s]  let's ago we have to go pretty low to get under these your career can't get
[19616.64s -> 19621.04s]  any lower yeah my monkey ball career I'm doing everything I'm doing fine what
[19621.04s -> 19627.06s]  you talking about I'm okay like what do you mean my career we put away what's
[19627.06s -> 19636.04s]  not my career we're talking about yeah that okay so very clearly I need to be
[19636.04s -> 19643.08s]  very odd when you close the thing it drops like a stone there is no forward
[19643.08s -> 19652.70s]  momentum the thing just drops like a fucking anchor okay what's wrong with
[19652.70s -> 19680.67s]  clouds you don't want momentum okay here we go it just closed a bunch of water in
[19680.67s -> 19719.29s]  there with them okay give me some points for God's sake actually I make my
[19719.29s -> 19739.12s]  descent I think it's time to make this sent well it's so fast look at the wind

[19768.59s -> 19780.34s]  become the subs no they don't what is this this is not subs it's not the subs
[19780.34s -> 19796.43s]  at all actually I think I saved over the subs it's not good hold on a second
[19796.43s -> 19811.53s]  hold on a second hold on a second I can get it I'll see you Thursday guys for
[19811.53s -> 19821.21s]  Left 4 Dead I didn't what was the last time I actually opened Left 4 Dead well
[19821.21s -> 19825.82s]  I think it was pretty recently but actually played a campaign you probably
[19825.86s -> 19828.42s]  have to go back to one of the old YouTube videos that's on the channel
[19828.42s -> 19836.65s]  playing with friends from like 2012 2013 that's probably the last time I did it
[19836.65s -> 19849.20s]  all right let me make sure I can get this we go all right we're good prices
[19849.20s -> 19868.53s]  averted here come on the subs today I can actually get this to run oh they
[19868.53s -> 19881.01s]  come yeah there they are that's a lot you guys are fading in and out so fast
[19881.01s -> 19895.69s]  because there were so many stop doing that there we go I kind of like this
[19895.69s -> 19899.22s]  style a little bit because it doesn't just blow by you can actually see the
[19899.22s -> 19906.30s]  name pop up although I think I messed it up I have to make the font bigger that's
[19906.30s -> 19915.89s]  my fault though I screwed it up and move this no what are you gonna do for my
[19915.89s -> 19922.20s]  birthday I don't know I really have no idea I'll be going to dinner somewhere I
[19922.20s -> 19938.70s]  don't know though wow that was my name it's my name I think if my music back to
[19938.70s -> 19944.50s]  I gotta redo all my stream stuff I need a new computer at least a new graphics
[19944.50s -> 19949.71s]  card the 38 is any good anyone that has one of the eight that exist are they
[19949.71s -> 19959.49s]  good are they yeah we'll do a raid we'll do we actually are going to we'll raid
[19959.49s -> 19972.33s]  we'll raid kitboga bogas live right now I'll be like I said joining him as a
[19972.33s -> 19976.84s]  guest spot on Friday so go take a look and see a kind of what you can expect
[19976.84s -> 19990.54s]  it more for designers and creators less for gaming yeah but I feel like I could
[19990.54s -> 19997.22s]  probably with with a better graphics card a better CPU I could probably have
[19997.22s -> 20007.70s]  the stream be somewhere like around 900 p and then drop my CPU limit kind of
[20007.70s -> 20013.03s]  processor down so the stream will just look better that CPU preset I could put
[20013.03s -> 20024.57s]  it at slow probably if I got like a 3080 and a one of the new thread rippers or
[20024.57s -> 20029.50s]  something I don't know I have to look into it but that was super monkey ball
[20029.50s -> 20036.41s]  and that's the stream I am in very surprised actually beat I thought I was
[20036.41s -> 20044.98s]  gonna give up at like level 31 go say hello to kitboga and I will see you all
[20044.98s -> 20052.41s]  on Thursday for it left for dead have a great night everybody take care of
