[1.34s -> 13.43s]  Afternoon, everybody. I'll be on a swell a couple of days. Don't forget about the pre-stream bits.
[14.07s -> 25.93s]  Holy shit, don't... uh, yeah, don't forget about those. Oh my god. We... we... I just turned it on.
[26.49s -> 41.58s]  Wait, you... this is before the stream even went on. Uh, Fat Bossant. Fat Bossant. Fat Bossient.
[41.58s -> 46.55s]  I don't know, I'm saying your name like it's a croissant. Uh, thank you for the 50 dollars.
[47.82s -> 58.02s]  50 bucks from Fat Bossant. RIP January 23, 2019 at 7 43 p.m. The YouTube link here, let's just make
[58.02s -> 76.42s]  sure. Let's see what we're getting into here. All right, where even is that plane? Is this even
[76.42s -> 90.26s]  plane? I don't like this. So is that Eastern time? Does it count if I go back in time like
[90.26s -> 98.31s]  I did? Wednesday, January 23, at 7 43 p.m. But that could be local time.
[99.19s -> 112.97s]  Fate knows you moved any time zone other than EST. Fate predicted that you would move. Well,
[112.97s -> 120.84s]  whatever. Even if it is Eastern. Let's go by the original fate. That would mean that at 4...
[121.80s -> 129.93s]  at 4 43 tomorrow, I'm gonna be in this chair with my room duct taped. And I'm gonna be...
[130.65s -> 138.49s]  I had quite the Amazon order. Uh, if Amazon like wanted to like take a look at people
[138.49s -> 145.91s]  what they were buying. I bought like a hockey mask, duct tape, and like hockey pads.
[147.32s -> 150.92s]  Sometimes I look at my fucking orders that I put through and I go, my god, what am I doing?
[151.80s -> 167.64s]  I'm like a murderer. Like Jason. When do you think he gets those masks? He has an Amazon
[167.64s -> 178.04s]  subscription order that comes in like once or twice a month. Why are you playing hockey
[178.04s -> 186.70s]  in Vegas? Vegas has got a good hockey team. They just got one. The Golden Knights. But
[186.70s -> 195.74s]  regardless, thank you so much to Fat Bossiant for 5,000 bits before the stream even turned on.
[197.99s -> 205.62s]  The fact that you do just give that. Thanks a lot. Really. Thank you so fucking much for 50
[205.62s -> 220.04s]  dollars. And then P337R for 25 dollars. Thank you so much Peter for the 25 bucks. And then
[220.04s -> 227.18s]  Fat Bossiant said that they demand Tim Machine 9 for the next Jerma Rumble. And he's like,
[227.18s -> 231.02s]  he's traveling all over the world in different time periods. So he might show up. He might
[231.02s -> 237.82s]  not. Anyways, we're gonna play a game called, why don't we just switch to it so you know what
[237.82s -> 244.55s]  it is, Lifeline. This game is for PlayStation 2. It uses the PlayStation 2 microphone,
[245.77s -> 250.41s]  which is, was actually kind of hard to track down because there's only like two mics
[250.41s -> 255.77s]  that work with this game. And I couldn't really find an original PlayStation 2 one.
[256.41s -> 260.25s]  And I didn't really want an original PlayStation 2 one because I don't think it's that high
[260.25s -> 265.21s]  quality. It would probably misunderstand everything I was saying. So I had to get a,
[266.17s -> 272.38s]  an old Logitech PS2 headset and I tested it. It works. I know you're not seeing any
[272.38s -> 280.66s]  audio right now, but what's a bet. Thanks to the five community subs and Herbert,
[280.66s -> 287.08s]  both of you, five community subs, 10 in total here. You guys are fucking awesome. Yeah,
[287.08s -> 289.56s]  the audio is not on because you guys are gonna have to play a little game here
[290.71s -> 297.59s]  called capturing the PlayStation 2 through a little box from little box to capture card,
[297.59s -> 302.39s]  capture card to PC. There's going to be like a thousand milliseconds of audio delay.
[302.39s -> 306.07s]  So we're going to do a Dora the fucking Explorer here in the beginning where you
[306.07s -> 312.18s]  guys are going to help me turn and fix this shit. So for a second I thought it
[312.18s -> 319.11s]  didn't have a controller. I was like, well, that ruined everything. No, I got one right here.
[319.11s -> 323.83s]  So the, this is lifeline. It's a game. You, I don't even need a controller
[323.83s -> 328.81s]  because the whole game is used with your voice. Every single thing in the game. It's a voice
[328.81s -> 336.15s]  command voice activated game and it's like an action shooter and we're going to try to beat
[336.15s -> 343.61s]  the whole game. No, we're not. You might see me here for like five hours. I can't promise
[343.61s -> 351.08s]  that anyways. I'm ready to go. Let's go ahead and get started. Let me just get this
[351.08s -> 359.06s]  on. God, last time I wore a headset like this was like three months ago because I moved and I
[359.06s -> 365.00s]  had to get a similar one, but this is only for the PlayStation 2. Let's get an audio sync in
[365.00s -> 370.97s]  here before we do anything else. So here comes the audio and you guys are going to have
[370.97s -> 379.02s]  the fun job. I gotta make sure it's in the right spot. Okay. So let's do a little audio
[379.02s -> 383.26s]  sync test here. I'm going to press the start button. Not you. Hold on. Okay. Ready?
[384.22s -> 391.24s]  So how does that sound? You should be hearing a little like did it and did it in every time
[391.24s -> 399.32s]  it's selected. It's okay. That's good. All right. Now we're going to do a thing where I'm matching
[399.32s -> 406.06s]  my voice to it. Oh my God. Somebody's to give a hundred dollars. It's a, this is almost
[406.06s -> 410.90s]  two hundred dollars and I haven't even done anything. I just turned on a stream. Oh my
[410.90s -> 418.98s]  goodness. Vladimir. Vladimir, bad man. Thanks for the hundred dollars. 10,000 bits. Thank you.
[419.62s -> 423.75s]  I'm going to say thanks for the years of quality content, Jerma. Shame about your untimely death
[423.75s -> 430.86s]  tomorrow. I'll be just fine. I got a fat suit. I got hockey pads. I'm patting myself and I'm
[430.86s -> 433.42s]  going to sit here and we're going to just fucking read nursery rhymes or something.
[435.26s -> 443.11s]  I, I, I'll be just fine. I'll buy boxing gloves. But holy shit, Vladimir. Thank you
[443.11s -> 450.07s]  for the extreme amount of money. All of the, all of you guys. My God. All right, here we go.
[450.07s -> 460.10s]  Ready? One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. We lined up.
[468.63s -> 474.55s]  Almost good. Sounds fine. There's a tiny delay. All right. So you, is it my voice first or
[474.55s -> 488.63s]  is it game audio first? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. So my voice is first. So it's like,
[489.43s -> 503.61s]  let me, let me, this fixes it. See if it's okay. You ready? Oh my God. Oh no,
[503.61s -> 508.41s]  that's just like it's stream labs. I don't know why it takes like five minutes to show on screen
[508.41s -> 515.69s]  sometimes. Holy shit. I was about to lose my mind. All right. Ready? One, two, three, four.
[515.69s -> 520.73s]  One, two, three, four. One, two. Oh yeah. This game's gotta be fun. Oh yeah. This game's
[520.73s -> 527.53s]  gotta be fun. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. All right. We're going.
[528.89s -> 532.41s]  New game. This is lifeline PlayStation two. Let's get the fuck going. What do you say?
[533.21s -> 544.70s]  New game. Show your face. No, I'm wicked ugly. I'm too ugly today. I've been feeling kind of
[544.70s -> 551.56s]  ill lately. They're going to hear me say this. I don't want them to hear me say this.
[552.52s -> 559.94s]  Two to three centimeters from your mouth. Two to three centimeters from my mouth it is.
[560.74s -> 563.94s]  The position of the microphone is crucial. This is crucial.
[563.94s -> 574.97s]  Dual shock two.
[580.33s -> 586.01s]  All right. Circle when speaking. Hold it down. You got it.
[586.01s -> 599.37s]  Okay. Speak when talk now appears. Say hello. Hello. Hello. Microphone done. I'm just kidding.
[599.37s -> 620.34s]  Hello. Hello. PlayStation. Lifeline. Oh, you get points for how good you say it.
[620.34s -> 625.62s]  I'm gonna do just fine. I'm gonna put on my like used car salesman voice
[625.62s -> 629.62s]  or my telemarketer voice. I'm gonna get. Just wait.
[636.87s -> 649.06s]  Give an order to the character. Walk. I can.
[653.98s -> 656.30s]  Run. That's not great.
[656.78s -> 666.17s]  Okay. Stop. How many tiers of good pronunciation are there?
[673.74s -> 680.92s]  Go to the table. I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[687.30s -> 697.22s]  Look at the bottle. What? Fuck you. Turned out to be one. Like this names of objects
[697.22s -> 701.94s]  are revealed when instructions are given successfully. If you are not sure of the
[701.94s -> 706.66s]  name of an object, saying its dominant color or basic shape may work instead.
[707.78s -> 711.46s]  In this case, saying green bottle is better for recognition than simply saying
[711.46s -> 715.54s]  bottle. Once the name is revealed, you can give more specific instructions.
[721.21s -> 734.39s]  Check the wine. Why am I doing these so bad? Am I not saying it good enough? Do it faster.
[735.03s -> 738.81s]  Seems like nothing is unusual about the wine. When you find anything remotely curious,
[738.81s -> 742.73s]  it's best to check the item carefully. Additionally, certain objects can be
[742.73s -> 747.29s]  combined with various verbs when you give instructions. Drink the wine. Get the wine.
[749.45s -> 765.67s]  Oh god. Go back. I'm like, this is like an English lesson.
[766.76s -> 774.44s]  Remember when the enemy is detected, we will automatically move to the scene of battle.
[774.44s -> 780.04s]  So is it turn based or is it? Carefully observe the enemy while giving commands.
[780.04s -> 783.00s]  This thing doesn't have a head to stomach or a mouth. It's a shoe.
[784.12s -> 788.68s]  Carefully observe the shoe while getting attacked. Let's try making an actual attack.
[789.56s -> 807.38s]  Shoot. Jumped over it. Move left. Shoot head. I was waiting. It didn't do anything. Dodge.
[815.75s -> 824.97s]  This is going to be fun. Okay. Dodge and shoot. Should I do my like anime voice actor voice?
[824.97s -> 842.71s]  Is that better? It might be. Flee and recover. Shoot, shoot, shoot. Did I get them?
[843.48s -> 847.16s]  When multiple enemies appear, targeting can be prioritized with number one,
[847.88s -> 867.02s]  number two, et cetera. Number two. Number one. Okay. Let's shoot head. Shoot mouth.
[869.88s -> 898.95s]  Yeah. Yeah. Head shoot. Reload. Okay. How do I know what a weak spot is? Stomach. Stomach.
[899.91s -> 908.34s]  You should be aware of when giving commands. Why do I look like this?
[909.46s -> 915.82s]  Pay close attention to the following points. Pay attention to this because this is important
[915.82s -> 923.59s]  shit because I'm going to mess up a ton of these pronunciations. Use proper timing
[923.59s -> 929.43s]  when pressing and releasing the microphone button. Okay. Use the proper point volume.
[930.07s -> 940.86s]  Okay. Use clear pronunciation. This is just, this is a job interview instructions.
[942.94s -> 946.06s]  Make sure when you're at your interview, you talk with the proper voice volume.
[946.78s -> 956.04s]  Don't intimidate the interviewer. This concludes the tutorial. It does. All right. Let's go.
[956.76s -> 972.33s]  Let's go. Now we begin our tale. Let's go. Always immediately intimidate the interviewer
[972.33s -> 979.03s]  with a loud voice. Do your best Jim Carrey impression when you open the door to the
[979.03s -> 987.13s]  position. There's no subtitles. Not only was he one of the era's finest medical minds,
[987.85s -> 999.22s]  he also made contributions in alchemy, astrology, astronomy, and mysticism. When he was in his
[999.22s -> 1006.58s]  thirties, he was said to have incredible healing abilities. That prompted him to adopt the name
[1006.58s -> 1015.82s]  of Perichelsus, superseding Kelsus, the famed doctor of ancient times. In his later years,
[1016.38s -> 1022.78s]  he is said to have gone on a journey of healing, visiting the terminally ill and
[1022.78s -> 1026.58s]  curing them. I'm not doing this voice.
[1032.92s -> 1037.24s]  It just pops up on screen. Bad. The narrator's like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[1037.24s -> 1060.04s]  That was perfect pronunciation. That was, was that actually Orson Welles? That was, this is
[1060.04s -> 1075.99s]  1998. No, this is 2004 guys. Pretty nice graphics. December 24th, 2029, 10 PM. That's
[1075.99s -> 1082.18s]  your new death date, Jeremy. Yeah, this is PlayStation 2 guys. Give it a little bit of
[1082.18s -> 1104.39s]  slack. It's PlayStation 2 being upscaled to like 720p or like 1080 nearly. Doesn't look that bad.
[1104.39s -> 1112.14s]  No, it doesn't. I mean, this little device that I have is pretty much works great.
[1119.35s -> 1124.07s]  I really don't know. I don't appreciate the long like Star Wars pause silence thing.
[1125.03s -> 1143.72s]  It was the same scene from a different angle. Is this the monitor room? Here we go. My
[1143.72s -> 1148.78s]  first command. Open. No, I'm not going to say that. That's so, that's too easy. That's
[1148.78s -> 1152.06s]  a very low hanging fruit. I'm not going to grab it. I'm reaching for the fucking
[1152.06s -> 1168.84s]  coconut that's up there. I'm not reaching for the banana. A wound. I can't read that.
[1168.84s -> 1170.92s]  Surveillance camera recording canceled.
[1184.46s -> 1187.18s]  Okay, I did that voice. That's, that's a much better example.
[1195.03s -> 1201.51s]  Today. So this occasion is extra meaningful for me. Today we mark the first day to the end
[1201.51s -> 1208.07s]  of our long running. That's me and Naomi. We were lucky to be invited to the space station
[1208.07s -> 1219.59s]  hotel. Cheers. Good evening. Don't drink it. Do you like a cocktail? No. How do I say no?
[1221.03s -> 1236.98s]  No, thank you. I don't drink. Naomi. Yeah. Why is she doing this?
[1237.46s -> 1241.42s]  But the government has been promising economic relief.
[1241.42s -> 1244.54s]  Why are you just watching unedited video footage of when you were here?
[1245.34s -> 1250.28s]  You're probably looking for something. Somebody, somebody did something bad.
[1251.08s -> 1263.46s]  This is when the aliens come in. The whole room shook violently and something crashed the party.
[1267.86s -> 1293.43s]  Red eyes. Insatiable hunger. They started eating guests. I heard it in my eyes. And then
[1293.43s -> 1303.27s]  I passed out. I can't believe we're spending Christmas in space. Thank you.
[1304.23s -> 1310.74s]  Oh, is that, is that some like exposition to tell us that that
[1311.38s -> 1328.02s]  separated from my beloved girlfriend? I can't even see. Okay, this is the security room.
[1330.73s -> 1335.91s]  I understand what this game is. Can anyone come in please?
[1335.91s -> 1344.81s]  I'm the security officer giving instructions. I'm just like the fat guy sitting there at
[1344.81s -> 1361.32s]  security detail. Hello. Hey. You don't sound like the regular guy.
[1364.10s -> 1369.40s]  Anyway, it doesn't matter who you listen. Will you please undo the lock?
[1369.96s -> 1377.85s]  I mean, you didn't say please. Okay. Understood. Please hurry.
[1377.85s -> 1382.57s]  Holy shit. What a fucking unbelievable game. This game. When did this game come up?
[1383.29s -> 1388.26s]  There's no way that just happened. Please disengage the lock on the store.
[1388.90s -> 1393.66s]  Uh, hold on a minute. I'm just currently processing some information here.
[1393.66s -> 1399.90s]  We can talk after I get out of here. Please disengage the lock door panel. Disengage. If you
[1399.90s -> 1405.80s]  press the button, you'll access the door panel and the button again. That will open the
[1405.80s -> 1413.69s]  panel for controlling. Oh, it's supposed to be a voice game. Operate to disengage the
[1413.69s -> 1418.01s]  detaining cell door lock to operate. Open the control panel. Disengage the lock on the store.
[1418.09s -> 1433.43s]  The lock is open. Saved at last. A real headcase security guard locked me up in there for over an
[1433.43s -> 1445.08s]  hour. Geez. I didn't know what was going to happen. So what's your story? Are you trapped
[1445.08s -> 1449.48s]  inside that monitor room? So we share the same dilemma. Oh, I wish I could have told
[1449.48s -> 1463.54s]  my story. And now? I would have talked her ear off. Uh, YDNA 10 community subs right now.
[1465.18s -> 1476.26s]  Thank you. It's not in here. 10 community subs. A lot of money. Thanks a lot. Huge thanks.
[1476.82s -> 1485.64s]  What are you looking for? I'm positive that it's here in this room. What is in the room?
[1492.34s -> 1499.06s]  It's locked. I'll take care of this. Stand back. Just like you ended the other one.
[1508.02s -> 1514.42s]  Yeah, I'm Superman. Look at how powerful I am. I can make red bars green and then
[1514.42s -> 1524.71s]  you can open them. Where are you going? Yeah, I can't. Yeah, I can't talk right now.
[1525.51s -> 1534.89s]  Where'd you get the gun? Here it is. You just have that. I should take care of any monsters.
[1535.61s -> 1539.59s]  Look, I'm in a bit of a hurry. Just wait there to be rescued. If we're lucky,
[1539.59s -> 1544.65s]  we'll see each other soon. Until then. Uh, that's not gonna happen. You're gonna
[1544.65s -> 1565.37s]  open this door and you're gonna need my help immediately. Get up. Okay, here we go.
[1571.13s -> 1598.54s]  Dodge right. Step back. Step back. Shoot right eye. Run left. Back. Shoot. Shoot left eye.
[1603.67s -> 1624.87s]  Shoot left eye. Shoot mouth. Back. Back. Dodge roll. Okay. Shoot left eye.
[1626.62s -> 1637.35s]  Shoot left eye. Shoot tail. Shoot tail. Shoot tail. Back. Run away.
[1638.52s -> 1654.70s]  Don't run away. Run away. Okay. Shoot middle eye. No, she did that on her own. Shoot middle eye.
[1657.93s -> 1674.52s]  Shoot middle eye. Back. Shoot mouth. Oh, shoot red eye. Back. Dodge left.
[1676.36s -> 1690.42s]  Dodge left. Shoot red eye. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot eye. Shoot red eye. Reload.
[1691.38s -> 1720.36s]  Shoot the sans eye. Shoot red eye. Shoot red eye. Don't put that, what are you doing?
[1722.10s -> 1724.90s]  That's a dangerously close place to put your, don't put your head there.
[1725.94s -> 1733.78s]  My god, you're gonna be a heart attack later. What the fuck?
[1733.78s -> 1739.38s]  There, weren't you? You were with the girl in the dark blue dress.
[1741.50s -> 1754.39s]  That girl you were with, what was her name? Frank. Fred. Wendy. Wrong. That wasn't her name.
[1754.39s -> 1759.51s]  Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue. She didn't want to tell me. Agatha. I'm talking about
[1759.51s -> 1765.67s]  your girlfriend. I got lots of girlfriends, so I mean. That can't be true. What's your
[1765.67s -> 1775.29s]  girlfriend's name? I don't, I don't remember her name. I don't remember. That can't be true.
[1775.29s -> 1786.30s]  Come on, what's the name of that girl? I don't know. Nancy. Vicki. No, no, wrong name.
[1786.30s -> 1793.66s]  Vicki? Vicki. No, no, wrong name. Your girlfriend's name. Sarah. Sarah? No, that's
[1794.38s -> 1801.42s]  not it. Stacy. Stephanie. Wrong. It was three syllables. Jessica. Jessica. Wrong.
[1802.06s -> 1808.62s]  It was three syllables. Jennifer. Jennifer? No, no, wrong name. Help me out here, lady.
[1808.62s -> 1815.02s]  Come on, what's the name of that girl? Linda. Linda. Rhonda. No, that's not it.
[1815.02s -> 1820.22s]  It was three syllables. Come on, what's the name of that girl? Naomi.
[1821.02s -> 1828.31s]  Oh, and she. I wouldn't have got, we would have been there all day. I would have had to
[1828.31s -> 1832.47s]  reset the game if I didn't get cheated in chat. Well, no wonder, and all that commotion.
[1832.47s -> 1838.07s]  Me, I don't even remember how I managed to get out of the restaurant. I'm worried about her.
[1839.03s -> 1843.66s]  She may be in need of help somewhere. I didn't, I don't, I didn't even know.
[1843.66s -> 1849.90s]  Listen, can I ask for your help? Before escaping from the station hotel, there's something that
[1849.90s -> 1855.54s]  I have to find. Can you help me out as an operator, like the way you did before?
[1856.89s -> 1863.27s]  In return, I'll find your Naomi along the way. So it's a deal? I can count on your help?
[1867.83s -> 1877.56s]  SpongeBob meme. Punching over. Can I count on your help? You can call me Rio. Okay, glad
[1877.56s -> 1891.06s]  to meet you, operator. Are you ready? Oh, should have to say yes. I forgot. I did like
[1891.06s -> 1899.51s]  do everything. I guess there's no need for formal introductions. Oh, yes. Well, that's
[1899.51s -> 1905.59s]  fine. I won't fail in my search. All right, let's shut down the stream. That's the worst
[1905.59s -> 1911.19s]  joke. It was, it was a fake one. I was making a fake reference to a meme overuse thing.
[1911.19s -> 1915.83s]  Let's choose a password for ourselves. Oh, no. You don't know very much about this hotel,
[1915.83s -> 1919.51s]  do you? I need a password. I bet there's lots of things that'll confuse you while
[1919.51s -> 1925.19s]  we're searching. Like what should we be doing for instance? So in a situation like that,
[1926.15s -> 1933.35s]  let's see. Banana. Coconut. Say consultation. Consultation? If you say that, I'll explain
[1933.35s -> 1940.15s]  things to you. Okay? Try saying the word. This is just that movie with um. Say it please.
[1941.03s -> 1947.59s]  Consultation. Yep, a consultation. With Tom Cruise. We have to go search the station
[1947.59s -> 1950.47s]  hotel thoroughly after this. No, that's a fucking spoiler. We'll have to go everywhere.
[1950.47s -> 1955.67s]  I can't do movie and TV spoilers this stream. I intend to follow your instructions for
[1955.75s -> 1960.87s]  doing most things. But if your instructions are hard to understand, I'll get confused.
[1960.87s -> 1964.39s]  For instance, if you were to say go over there, I'd be like, which way is there?
[1964.39s -> 1967.27s]  I'd be like. So if you want me to go somewhere, I want you to say its name.
[1970.94s -> 1975.10s]  For example, in this room, there are places like the lockers and the table.
[1975.10s -> 1978.46s]  Four fridges. You know how you can just play maps in the monitor room?
[1980.60s -> 1982.68s]  Direct me where you want to go by the name on the map.
[1983.48s -> 1992.66s]  Okay. Do you understand? Not really, but yes. Okay. The map that you just saw, you can access
[1992.66s -> 1997.06s]  and display it on your monitor. If there's anything else you don't understand, check the
[1997.06s -> 2002.26s]  keyword list. That list records keywords and phrases that are extracted from our dialogue.
[2003.22s -> 2006.34s]  Not only that, the list already contains words in the operator's manual.
[2007.30s -> 2010.98s]  Of course, there are plenty of words that aren't on the list. Anyway,
[2011.70s -> 2014.98s]  how about giving me my first instruction? What should I do?
[2021.66s -> 2038.25s]  A lot of options here. Go to the bathroom. Yep. No, no, no. I don't mean like that.
[2039.29s -> 2045.05s]  That's not what I mean, guys. I mean, like I want to go into the bathroom.
[2048.70s -> 2064.34s]  She's currently walking around. She did it. Okay. Get a snack from the vending machine.
[2064.34s -> 2074.70s]  The vending machine. Okay. Bottom left vending machine receptacle.
[2075.26s -> 2087.32s]  These are the vending machines. Put hand in vending machine. Put hand in leftmost slot.
[2088.74s -> 2101.29s]  If there is something, it would be good. Nope. Too bad. It's empty. Dispenser.
[2106.14s -> 2114.92s]  Put hand in right dispenser. There was nothing. I'm disappointed.
[2115.64s -> 2120.66s]  I see something in there. Put hand in dispenser slot number three.
[2121.46s -> 2132.79s]  Put hand in dispenser. Put hand in dispenser. Grab item in dispenser.
[2132.79s -> 2145.21s]  Which dispenser do you mean? Put hand in first dispenser slot on the right.
[2146.18s -> 2158.41s]  I've checked it earlier. That was enough. Put hand in second from the right dispenser slot.
[2159.50s -> 2168.01s]  I've checked it earlier. That was enough. Middle right dispenser. The dispenser?
[2168.57s -> 2175.72s]  I don't know what you mean. Put hand in middle right dispenser.
[2176.44s -> 2188.09s]  I've checked it earlier. That was enough. Check all dispensers.
[2188.81s -> 2197.77s]  Which dispenser do you mean? Check third dispenser. Check third dispenser.
[2198.33s -> 2204.73s]  Which dispenser do you mean? Check currently selected dispenser.
[2205.37s -> 2214.12s]  Which dispenser do you mean? Check red dispenser. Which dispenser do you mean?
[2216.01s -> 2224.10s]  Check red dispenser. Which dispenser do you mean? Check red dispenser three.
[2224.74s -> 2228.10s]  Which dispenser do you mean? There's an item in there that I have to get.
[2230.84s -> 2236.63s]  Red left. That's not going to work. Pilot guy, thanks for the five community subs.
[2237.85s -> 2248.28s]  Thank you. Just coming in right now. Left red. I've checked it earlier. That was enough.
[2250.07s -> 2253.51s]  Just do it without the mic. Those of you that are just joining the stream,
[2253.51s -> 2262.55s]  I cannot move. It's only voice commands only. Check the third slot. It only says juice.
[2264.31s -> 2270.63s]  Everything sold out except for prune juice. Consultation. Wait a second. Can that
[2270.63s -> 2277.83s]  consultation wait? Let's check this first. No, I can't even get tech support. I'm on hold right
[2277.83s -> 2299.14s]  now. Okay, I'm going to try this again. Grab. You're too vague. I don't know what you mean.
[2299.14s -> 2308.52s]  Check dispenser slot three. Which dispenser do you mean? Look at right dispenser.
[2309.54s -> 2320.54s]  I've checked it earlier. That was enough. Check second from the right dispenser.
[2321.67s -> 2333.99s]  I've checked it earlier. That was enough. The item's right here. Just dispenser three.
[2334.71s -> 2343.72s]  I've said every single one of these. Check dispenser three. Which dispenser do you mean?
[2343.72s -> 2358.73s]  That's what happens. Right vending machine. These are the vending machines. Grab item red
[2358.73s -> 2363.29s]  from left. No, that's like I got hit the head with a hammer and just said five random words.
[2368.18s -> 2385.18s]  Pick up item from dispenser. I've checked it earlier. That was enough. I can't select them
[2385.18s -> 2394.47s]  either. There's an item in here. She needs to get this. There is an item in the dispenser
[2394.47s -> 2416.23s]  on the right. No response. Germa, your right is her left. No, it isn't. What? Check second
[2416.23s -> 2423.59s]  dispenser from the right. There's something in here. Okay, I said that like 15 times.
[2434.82s -> 2441.75s]  Back up. Pardon me? Do what to what? Sure you did. I did. I said it like five, 10 times.
[2442.79s -> 2453.05s]  Leave. What is it? Leave. Leave the room? Okay. No. No, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop what you're
[2453.05s -> 2462.33s]  doing. The lockers. Okay. Oh no, not like I'll, this is Sesame Street bullshit all over again.
[2464.22s -> 2495.26s]  Open locker all the way to the right. I checked that earlier. Oh god. I didn't even
[2495.26s -> 2507.06s]  say anything. A license plate. This is a chip. I'll take this. Good. It might be useful later.
[2515.34s -> 2519.99s]  I really like your hat. The writing's too sloppy for me to read.
[2520.87s -> 2526.89s]  Why don't you analyze it? Sure thing. I'll analyze. December reading material
[2526.89s -> 2531.29s]  purchases electronic newspaper magazines. All reading materials are to be returned to the
[2531.29s -> 2542.46s]  designated spaces after use. Grab guard's note. It's a handwritten note. It doesn't look
[2542.46s -> 2552.74s]  important. To you, but it's reading material for me when I'm on the can. Um, okay. I mean,
[2552.74s -> 2561.02s]  do I got a map? Where's my map? Okay, here's, there's some basic commands we got here.
[2561.58s -> 2570.15s]  Oh, I gotta like it. Okay. This is, this is giving me some tips on how to play.
[2572.66s -> 2576.58s]  Javadab coming in with 10 community subs. I guess you're stumped too, operator.
[2576.58s -> 2579.38s]  Javadab coming in with 10 community subs. What do you think about that?
[2583.13s -> 2588.58s]  Nothing at all. But thank you, Javadab. A lot of big subs and big bits
[2589.14s -> 2594.58s]  very early in the stream. So thank you guys. Why were you in that holding cell?
[2594.58s -> 2615.51s]  Holding cell one. Okay. You're gonna go stop. Stop. Yes. Video recording, disc, handgun,
[2616.55s -> 2626.01s]  heel capsule. I need like the, I need a map. Here we go. Is he actually watching me?
[2630.63s -> 2644.22s]  Go into the living room. Okay. I'll leave. Check table. The table. Okay. Look at all
[2644.22s -> 2657.62s]  this shit on here. Drink coffee. Drink liquid in cup. Huh? This strange command. I don't get
[2657.62s -> 2665.34s]  it. Well, you don't get it obviously. Anything here of value that I need to get? Check document.
[2666.06s -> 2676.92s]  Pardon me? Do what to what? Look at magazine. This is a really popular entertainment magazine.
[2676.92s -> 2689.69s]  I read it occasionally. Find fax machine. Fax me magazine. The vending machine. Okay. No,
[2689.69s -> 2707.82s]  stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop. Yes. Check table. The table. Okay. Grab cup. Shooting will just put
[2707.82s -> 2720.97s]  a hole through it. Get in the clown car. 10 community subs. Thank you. Thank you to the
[2720.97s -> 2729.50s]  10 community subs clown car. Grab cup. This paper cup must be from the vending machine.
[2730.14s -> 2741.35s]  It's empty. I'm not gonna say that. So there's nothing in it. I can't take it though. Take
[2741.35s -> 2747.14s]  cup. I don't intend to take anything except what I need. But that's not what I'm telling you to do.
[2749.34s -> 2758.71s]  Check papers. Paper? There's a lot of paper around. Which do you mean? Check left paper.
[2759.51s -> 2768.07s]  It's a report by the security guards. Tell her to bark like a dog. Little dog or big dog?
[2772.14s -> 2779.53s]  Scream as loud as you can. Let's see. This month's features on chips. I collect them too.
[2781.82s -> 2790.09s]  Scream. When you say it that way, I don't know what you mean. So what is that? That's report.
[2790.81s -> 2798.68s]  What does that mean? A tablet? Check tablet. Are you talking about this? Yes. Yes. By the
[2798.68s -> 2809.78s]  desks? Okay. What? No, no, no, no, no. I was answering a question. That's all right. Grab
[2809.78s -> 2817.66s]  notebook. It's the security guards notebook. Like a diary. I'm not interested. Sure. Okay.
[2817.66s -> 2827.58s]  We've got some consoles here. Activate left console. Not a chance. It's totally wrecked.
[2828.54s -> 2833.10s]  All of them? All these PCs all fucked up. Caution. Malfunction caused by abnormal external
[2833.10s -> 2845.19s]  shock. Yeah. What else is in here? Table. This is pretty much it. So we got, we got the stuff
[2845.19s -> 2855.05s]  we needed. Let's take, you know, holding cell. Go now. Holding cell one. Okay. Faster. By the
[2855.05s -> 2861.61s]  desks. Okay. Now holding cell one. Holding cell one. Okay. Run to holding cell one. Holding cell
[2861.61s -> 2874.14s]  one. Okay. How do I save the game? You guys are with the community subs tonight. Holy shit. Jamie,
[2874.14s -> 2887.03s]  five community subs. Thank you. Run to holding cell one. Holding cell one. Okay.
[2887.67s -> 2902.92s]  Huh? What's this? Grab the Mio water enhancer. What even is that? Holding cell two. Holding
[2902.92s -> 2907.88s]  cell two. Right. There's nothing in here. I checked from corner to corner while I was locked up.
[2910.52s -> 2916.09s]  Check holding cell three. Okay. Holding cell three. This place is empty. Let's check
[2916.09s -> 2928.02s]  somewhere else. Moron. I am walking. All right. Well I got it. Holding cell one. I checked
[2928.02s -> 2935.38s]  everything. So now we gotta go. I'm not sure where the hell. How do I get? Go to the
[2935.38s -> 2949.69s]  hallway. Okay. I'll leave. Never checked tablets. That's the save point? I told her to look at it
[2949.69s -> 2959.61s]  and she looked at me with. Operator, look. Emergency shutters have been activated all over
[2959.61s -> 2963.69s]  the place. It doesn't look like we'll be able to go on a casual tour of the station.
[2964.73s -> 2974.36s]  First there's something I'd like you to confirm. What's that? Please analyze this video disc.
[2978.14s -> 2981.10s]  Interview footage. December 24th to the observatory restaurant.
[2982.63s -> 2987.11s]  On. Okay. You managed to get back. You couldn't just flip the phone up yourself.
[2989.99s -> 2992.95s]  Do you see the woman who's interviewing Prime Minister Takayama?
[2994.23s -> 2999.51s]  Her name is Helen Johnson. She's a big wig announcer for a major TV network.
[3001.00s -> 3005.72s]  I need to find her and speak with her. She has information that can help me.
[3005.72s -> 3009.72s]  Your autograph can wait. I haven't found a single lead since the chaos started.
[3011.16s -> 3016.98s]  I'll have to check rooms one by one. Helen, the reporter and your Naomi.
[3017.94s -> 3022.10s]  Let's work together and find them. Okay. How about some guidance?
[3023.24s -> 3030.98s]  Where should I start searching? I forget. I don't know what that place is even called.
[3030.98s -> 3044.47s]  So go to vending machine. Okay. I'll walk. Go to holding cell one. Shutter one. Okay.
[3044.47s -> 3065.16s]  Oh no. What? What's going on? Oh, shoot head. Shoot. Shoot head. Shoot stomach.
[3069.02s -> 3079.50s]  Turn around. Turn left. Back. Back. Back. Shoot head. Shoot stomach. One.
[3081.02s -> 3103.10s]  Shoot head. Two. Shoot stomach. Two. Oh my God. Look at all this. I need to go. I need to
[3103.10s -> 3110.62s]  save the fucking game. Can I leave? All right. Let's check. We're right here.
[3112.23s -> 3118.71s]  Go to guest room one. I'm talking. Excuse me. Go to guest room one.
[3119.88s -> 3132.90s]  Guest room one. Okay. Hurry up. Yes. The guest rooms are locked for security purposes.
[3133.86s -> 3136.02s]  You should be able to disengage the locks on your end.
[3139.72s -> 3143.40s]  Well, I was trying to talk and she just started speaking over me.
[3144.12s -> 3147.11s]  She's like, give me directions. And I'm like, sure. I'll give you directions.
[3147.11s -> 3154.07s]  I, you even let, I'm giving directions right now. Thanks. She, I was speaking first.
[3164.89s -> 3175.42s]  Is someone there? Pet peeve discovered. No, I'm just fucking kidding. So where should I begin
[3175.42s -> 3182.84s]  checking? Tell me please. No, you know what? I, when I am talking to somebody, listen to
[3182.84s -> 3187.48s]  this. Okay. When you're in a conversation with somebody and everybody has that moment
[3187.48s -> 3191.16s]  where they know that you start, you both start talking at the same time.
[3191.16s -> 3195.32s]  Right. So I have something I want to say and you have something you want to say.
[3195.32s -> 3199.88s]  It usually goes by who got, who got it out first. Right. And then you start to have that
[3199.88s -> 3204.20s]  internal fake little battle where who's going to stop talking first, who's going to let the
[3204.20s -> 3209.56s]  other one just win. So, you know, for instance, if we're talking about a movie we saw
[3209.56s -> 3213.16s]  and we're talking about like a Thanos or the infinity world was such a great movie.
[3213.16s -> 3217.48s]  And especially, I think the point of the movie is when Thanos, like if I start saying what I
[3217.48s -> 3221.56s]  think the point of the movie is, and you start saying the point of the movie is at the same time,
[3222.36s -> 3227.16s]  one of us has to back down eventually. So what happens is whoever got the word out first,
[3229.00s -> 3241.75s]  that person gets to keep going. The other one has to just back down. And then you can make
[3241.75s -> 3246.31s]  your point afterwards. Now, the problem is if that person does not let you in, right. So
[3246.31s -> 3250.39s]  if we start talking for five straight seconds, both, okay, you started saying you started
[3250.39s -> 3253.59s]  talking first. I'm going to back down here and you're going to talk for about 30 or 40
[3253.59s -> 3258.23s]  seconds. Now let me come in and think about the ship. The ship was just bullshit. It's like,
[3258.23s -> 3266.49s]  okay, now you're not playing by the rules. Every, every about 30 or 40 seconds you got
[3266.49s -> 3282.01s]  to let the other person in. Walk to table. You can't just talk for like two straight minutes
[3282.01s -> 3287.61s]  if somebody's in a conversation with you. It just doesn't work. Then that person eventually
[3287.61s -> 3294.50s]  is going to throw the hot coffee. Yes. Grab coffee cup.
[3300.25s -> 3322.41s]  Dump coffee on self. Grab camera. No film, no batteries, no lens. Okay, so
[3324.17s -> 3335.43s]  drink coffee. That's what I just said. All right. Read newspaper clipping.
[3344.47s -> 3346.23s]  Ordinary people couldn't afford this hotel.
[3352.28s -> 3365.08s]  Uh, save point. Go to save point. The save point, okay. Take out a hundred dollars cash.
[3371.67s -> 3378.95s]  No, no, no. Cancel the save. No, I forgot. Square is, it's the weird place that the
[3378.95s -> 3387.38s]  old PlayStation systems had. Yeah. Guest room one. Hour and 23 minutes. Number of commands
[3387.38s -> 3430.94s]  138. Go to bed. The bed. Okay. Monster. Shoot head. Shoot head. Dodge right. Shoot
[3430.94s -> 3451.35s]  stomach. Shoot mouth. Shoot stomach. Reload. Her aim is horrible. Yeah, it is. Don't,
[3451.35s -> 3458.39s]  oh my God. That's giving me so much. Yes, you've done it. Thanks to you. We're saved.
[3461.51s -> 3471.05s]  What? You're just a damn waitress. Great. So what's your name, baby? It's Rio. Jesus.
[3471.05s -> 3478.17s]  This thing had us trapped in the bathroom. Now I control this guy too. Freaking mess. Son
[3478.17s -> 3483.69s]  of a. Would you spit on the floor? Isn't it my luck to be saved by some waitress,
[3484.57s -> 3491.45s]  but I suppose I do owe you a thanks. I bet you're some greedy little gold digger looking to hook
[3491.45s -> 3499.75s]  a big sugar daddy and reel him in. Wait a minute. The monitors are live. Which ones?
[3499.75s -> 3505.59s]  Who's the operator anyway? George. He says he's a guest to the hotel. He's stuck in the
[3505.59s -> 3515.48s]  monitor room. Is that right? Well, that sucks for him. Doesn't it? Now you're on camera.
[3516.73s -> 3521.05s]  But what the hell is a guest doing in the monitor room? Yeah, somebody made a really
[3521.05s -> 3525.13s]  good point. Why are there cameras in the bedrooms? Well, if I know there was an
[3525.13s -> 3530.17s]  explosion, then those monsters appeared all over. God knows what the hell they are.
[3530.17s -> 3536.17s]  Some alien swarm or other. Still, they ain't jack if you can blow them away with a handgun.
[3537.05s -> 3541.21s]  Run along and rescue our guests. I'll look for the prime minister. This guy's gonna be
[3541.21s -> 3545.61s]  dead. But he came out of the transportation ministry and I'm screwed if he dies in my
[3545.61s -> 3552.81s]  hotel. Sir? What? Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Whoa. Problem with it?
[3557.91s -> 3566.71s]  Jerk. That was surprising. Save it for someone who cares, bimbo.
[3567.59s -> 3572.98s]  This guy's gonna end up like eaten in five minutes. Such an arrogant jerk. Yes,
[3572.98s -> 3582.33s]  that was manager Tanaka. He's in charge of this hotel. He told me to go rescue the guests.
[3582.33s -> 3590.70s]  Maybe he's the one who needs help. Well, anyway, what should we do now? We're in the bedroom,
[3590.70s -> 3598.84s]  right? Go to bed. The bed, okay. It's an ordinary bed, but with soft springs in it for low
[3598.84s -> 3605.40s]  gravity use. Huh, I wonder what this is. Another one of those devices. Hey, a heel
[3605.40s -> 3610.46s]  capsule. It's like a flask of whiskey. There doesn't seem to be anything else.
[3612.74s -> 3618.60s]  Lie in bed. The bed, okay. Lie down. There doesn't seem to be anything else.
[3619.24s -> 3628.62s]  Let's check somewhere else. Jump on bed. The bed, okay. There doesn't seem to be anything else.
[3629.18s -> 3646.20s]  Let's check somewhere else. Sit in chair. Nope. Uh, no. Okay. No. What else do we have here?
[3646.20s -> 3657.78s]  We got, uh, go to the emergency panel. The emergency panel. Okay. Tell her to do a sexy pose.
[3658.50s -> 3663.72s]  Is that like, that's like a meme thing? Emergency tools are stored in here. I'm pretty
[3663.72s -> 3671.53s]  certain that there's a key for the hallway shutters in here. That's strange. It looks
[3671.53s -> 3678.09s]  like someone's already taken it. Strange. What else? There's nothing else that needs checking.
[3678.89s -> 3699.02s]  Uh, then I guess, you know, I guess do a pose. Do a pose. Do a sexy pose. Stop. Yes.
[3699.96s -> 3714.36s]  Do a pose. Hello. What was that? Do a pose. I am stopped. Do a sexy pose. This is horseshit.
[3714.36s -> 3725.77s]  You guys just made me do this for no reason. Oh my God. I thought this is going to be like
[3725.77s -> 3733.06s]  one of the meme inputs. Is he actually watching me? Oh my God. Damn it. Okay. Whatever.
[3735.03s -> 3747.59s]  Go to the dresser. The dresser. Okay. You fuckers. It actually does exist.
[3752.41s -> 3762.01s]  Look at mirror. I want to get changed out of this outfit. Check luggage. Are you talking about
[3762.01s -> 3776.71s]  this? Check trunk. This is a chip. Another chip. Let's take this. Does she know if you,
[3776.71s -> 3781.03s]  how loud you are? I'm curious. All right. I'm going to be kind of loud here. So just want
[3781.03s -> 3784.31s]  to give you guys some warning. If you want to drag the volume slider a little bit to the
[3784.31s -> 3795.82s]  left here. I'm going to give you some warning. Here we go. By the bed. Okay. No. There doesn't
[3795.82s -> 3803.75s]  seem to be anything else. Let's check somewhere else. Go to mirror. I am walking.
[3804.94s -> 3815.42s]  Go to mirror. The table. Okay. Stop. Yes. Check mirror. I am standing. Go to mirror.
[3815.42s -> 3825.08s]  The dresser. Okay. What a weird fucking word that is. Look in mirror. I checked that earlier.
[3825.08s -> 3860.82s]  It's fine. Smash mirror. Eat glass. I'll go out into the hallway. Where should I go?
[3862.49s -> 3870.06s]  That's a great question. Run to security room. The security room. Okay. Run there.
[3871.22s -> 3877.66s]  There we go. Run. I am running. Run. I am running. Run faster. I am running. Run as fast
[3877.66s -> 3898.94s]  as you can. This is this. This is okay. This is the security room. Leave. Yes. Leave. I am stopped.
[3901.06s -> 3913.38s]  Leave room. Yes. I'm not going to say that. Leave the room. Don't do a lap. Do a lap. Yep.
[3916.25s -> 3922.36s]  Do a lap around the room. Okay. I'll leave. There we go. I'm not going to say that. Why
[3922.36s -> 3929.27s]  would I say that? That makes no sense. That doesn't make any sense. Why would that ever be
[3929.27s -> 3945.40s]  an input? Where should I go? All right. We got guest room. We'll go. Go to guest room four.
[3946.12s -> 3957.88s]  Guest room four. Okay. It's an Easter egg. Say it. Oh, is it really? Run. Yes. Walk.
[3959.16s -> 3973.16s]  Crawl. Yes. Sneak. I am running. I don't think I can do anything here. You'll be able to
[3973.16s -> 3977.40s]  control the shutter by inserting the emergency shutter key. I don't think I have that. If we
[3977.40s -> 3984.68s]  don't find the shutter key, we won't be able to progress. So we can't go that way.
[3985.64s -> 3999.05s]  So we can go to... Maybe we can't. Because that's... We can go to security room. Guest room one.
[3999.93s -> 4013.32s]  Let's see. Go to shutter nine. Shutter nine. Okay. Can we open this? No. Go to shutter seven.
[4013.32s -> 4022.66s]  Shutter seven. Okay. Run. Yes. Because only the two guest rooms. The guest room
[4022.66s -> 4035.22s]  and security room. I need a key. Can I open this one? No, I can't. If we don't find the
[4035.22s -> 4040.36s]  shutter key, we won't be able to progress. Is it the shutter keys in the guest room?
[4042.84s -> 4055.58s]  Go to security room. The security room. Okay. Run. Yes. Is that one thing on the table that
[4055.58s -> 4065.53s]  I didn't actually look at? Braid hair? Freudian weapon. Thanks for the five community subs.
[4065.61s -> 4080.89s]  Thank you so much. Five just came in. Check table. The table. Okay. What is this thing called?
[4081.69s -> 4089.61s]  Check newspaper. Oh. This is today's newspaper. That's too easy. And I'm not doing that. Why
[4089.61s -> 4097.54s]  would I... No, that doesn't do anything. Read newspaper? Today's opening party was the top
[4097.54s -> 4107.66s]  story. Tomorrow it'll be front page news again. I can't believe I'm... No, I'm not
[4107.66s -> 4115.58s]  going to say this because there's no way it's... There's no way. Go to guest room one. Leave the
[4115.58s -> 4134.63s]  room? Okay. Leave room. Run. Run. Yes. Everyone in the chat is just shouting commands that
[4134.63s -> 4152.34s]  I'm never going to say. Guest room one. Guest room one. Okay. Run. Run. Yes. Undo
[4152.34s -> 4159.10s]  the door lock please. It wasn't... Wasn't it already open? Oh my god. Why is it...
[4160.06s -> 4167.82s]  I just closed it. Sorry. The sun's sweet. Okay. What? No, no, no, no, no, no. Stop.
[4167.82s -> 4183.98s]  Guest room one. Guest room one. Okay. Run. Yes. Undo the door lock please. Thanks. File
[4183.98s -> 4188.74s]  your taxes. You're doing it wrong. Jerma, we're giving commands to you, not the girl.
[4191.14s -> 4197.90s]  Well, none of that's going to happen. All right. Bathroom. Go to bathroom. The bathroom.
[4197.90s -> 4208.74s]  Okay. Run. Yes. How did Tanaka manage to hide here? I think I see a disc underneath the sink.
[4211.05s -> 4222.06s]  Punch mirror. Is my face dirty? I'll wash it later. Wash face. It's an ordinary wash
[4222.06s -> 4236.71s]  stand. There's nothing unusual. Item under sink. Under the sink? Here's the shutter key.
[4239.75s -> 4251.82s]  Nice job. Nice job. Nice work. Nice work. Nice work. I didn't understand that.
[4251.82s -> 4257.98s]  I said nice fucking work. I didn't understand that. Nice work. The floor has been thoroughly
[4257.98s -> 4275.51s]  cleaned. It's sparkling. Good job. I'll walk. Back. The bathroom. Okay. Run. Yes. Shower. The
[4275.51s -> 4288.04s]  shower itself is ordinary. Over 90% of the water used here is recycled. Okay. Destroy window.
[4288.68s -> 4298.47s]  The living room. Okay. No, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Shoot mirror. Shoot mirror. Back. The bed.
[4298.47s -> 4306.31s]  Okay. Stop. Yes. Shoot mirror. Go to mirror. Okay. I got it already. Stop. There doesn't
[4306.31s -> 4311.51s]  seem to be anything else. You don't got it. You don't got it. You don't got it. Go to
[4311.59s -> 4330.28s]  bathroom. The bathroom. Okay. Run. Yes. Smash mirror. Okay. Now you can leave. What is it?
[4332.39s -> 4337.94s]  Shutter two. It's an ordinary shower. No, no. The water is recycled.
[4340.42s -> 4353.64s]  It's just a wash stand. Okay. I understand. Do you? Let's see. What did she understand?
[4356.71s -> 4364.54s]  Leave. Yes. Leave quickly. I am stopped. Leave. I am stopped. Hallway. Okay.
[4364.54s -> 4377.14s]  I'll leave. Run. Yes. What an odd game. Strangely enough, though, this works way better
[4377.78s -> 4381.46s]  than any game that's tried to do this 10 to 15 years later.
[4382.18s -> 4390.94s]  I'm getting interference. Hello. Operator. Wiggle mic. What? Wait, I'm hearing another voice.
[4395.06s -> 4405.22s]  Who is this? Other frequency. Hello. Hello. Operator. Can you hear me? There's definitely
[4405.22s -> 4413.16s]  someone calling for help. There's someone else alive out there. All right. Well, let's
[4413.88s -> 4425.06s]  what we're going to go shutter. We need some guests from two. Hold on. Come on. I need to
[4425.06s -> 4439.70s]  know what happens when I do this. I was going to sneeze. You're awfully slow with
[4439.70s -> 4461.58s]  instructions. Hold on. Okay. I'll walk. Yes. Let's see if Shido can give some commands.
[4461.58s -> 4467.77s]  You listen to me. This should open a shutter half the time. You listen to Shido completely.
[4468.57s -> 4478.65s]  Hurry up and go back. No, Shido. Don't tell. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm going to
[4478.65s -> 4488.42s]  override you here, Shido. Go back. Yep. Back to panel. No, we already looked under the bed.
[4488.42s -> 4498.36s]  There's nothing under the bed. No, we looked under the bed already. Analyze shutter panel.
[4498.92s -> 4507.16s]  It's okay. This control panel can be operated on your end. I'll get it. No, wait. The auto
[4507.16s -> 4517.59s]  control emergency shutter can now be opened and closed. Open it. Give, give Shido a turn.
[4520.30s -> 4522.38s]  No, no, I have to do this. It's not going to understand you.
[4523.82s -> 4538.63s]  Shoot right eye. Back. Back. Shoot right eye. Left eye. Shoot. Middle eye. Shoot. Red eye.
[4538.63s -> 4552.38s]  Shoot. You want to play? See how well Shido does. I'm just going to take a back seat here.
[4552.38s -> 4570.02s]  There's going to be a Shido stream for about five minutes. You ready? Okay. You can say it a little
[4570.02s -> 4585.54s]  louder. What do you want me to try to say? What are you trying to say here? Try something
[4585.54s -> 4603.40s]  else because she's obviously not getting it. Okay. Well, give me proper instructions. I'm
[4603.40s -> 4606.92s]  I know. I understand. Look, the game, the game is trying to listen to you. I know it's,
[4607.00s -> 4619.38s]  it's finicky sometimes. Maybe she's being too high. Go a little bit lower. I don't think this is
[4619.38s -> 4626.23s]  going to. No. All right. All right. Settle down. Settle down. I understand that they get,
[4626.23s -> 4632.46s]  I know the game sucks. That's fine. You're freaking out. Okay. It's, it's not going to
[4632.46s -> 4647.99s]  hear you. Just go back to bed. Go back to bed. Let me take over. Okay. Doesn't work. Go.
[4647.99s -> 4658.20s]  I am standing. Go to guest room two. Guest room two. Okay. Run. Yes. Stop.
[4660.20s -> 4664.76s]  Run. Yes. Stop. Run. Yes. Stop. Run. Stop.
[4666.26s -> 4701.56s]  Shido! Shido's in the game. Eat. Eat flour. Let me type in thing on face.
[4702.52s -> 4744.38s]  All right. Here we go. Here we go. Apparently not. What? Go.
[4744.38s -> 4781.00s]  Go. No, close it. I just opened it. No, close it. Close the door. Oh, fuck. Oh, no. It's all
[4781.00s -> 4791.54s]  right. We're right there. Imagine if I didn't save it the whole time. Yeah. This is, this
[4791.54s -> 4798.44s]  is simple. We're just going to run it. Look, we speed run on this. Go to bathroom. The
[4798.44s -> 4808.86s]  bathroom. Run. Yes. Oh, fuck. We have to do this again. No, sorry. I'm just going to go
[4808.86s -> 4816.79s]  bathroom and then door. We already got everything. Shoot mouth. Mouth. Shoot. Stomach.
[4816.79s -> 4827.69s]  Shoot. The guy's going to come out. We're just going to skip it. Skip. Skip cut scene.
[4831.54s -> 4838.81s]  Skip. Cutscene. Skip. Oh, fucking hell. Come on. Yes. You've done it. No skipping.
[4843.05s -> 4848.52s]  What? You're just a damn waitress? Great. So what's your name, baby?
[4849.16s -> 4863.18s]  It's okay. I have to do this shit again. Damn it. I need to, I gotta remember this
[4863.18s -> 4871.48s]  PlayStation 2. You got to save it every time you do something. Oh, you're some greedy
[4871.48s -> 4877.24s]  little gold digger. Look at the big sugar daddy and reel him in. No. What have I done?
[4879.22s -> 4884.58s]  Wait a minute. The monitor's alive? Which ones? Who's the operator anyway?
[4884.58s -> 4887.30s]  There's more than one camera. There's like five cameras in these rooms. He's a guest
[4887.30s -> 4895.98s]  to the hotel. He's stuck in the monitor room. Use Shito to voice act. That sucks for him,
[4895.98s -> 4899.98s]  doesn't it? Shito is only going to leave you around for like 10 minutes per stream.
[4899.98s -> 4903.82s]  What the hell is a guest doing in the monitor room? Mr. Schmelke, pardon me.
[4905.02s -> 4909.98s]  What's going on in the hotel? If I know, there was an explosion and then those monsters
[4909.98s -> 4915.42s]  appeared all over. God knows what in the hell they are. Some alien swarm or other.
[4916.38s -> 4918.54s]  Someone just clapped when Shito shows up, don't they?
[4920.14s -> 4924.94s]  Run along and rescue our guests. I'll look for the prime minister, the jackass.
[4924.94s -> 4929.82s]  But he came out of the transportation ministry and I'm screwed if he dies in my hotel.
[4929.82s -> 4935.98s]  I'm moving to Vegas. I've been here for a few months. You got a problem with it? I moved
[4935.98s -> 4945.00s]  in October. To help and you're being a real jerk. Still on the balloon. I'm streaming from
[4945.00s -> 4956.12s]  the balloon. Save it for someone who cares, bimbo. He's such an arrogant jerk. Yes,
[4956.12s -> 4965.45s]  that was manager Tanaka. He's in charge of this hotel. He told me to go rescue the guests.
[4965.45s -> 4970.33s]  Maybe he's the one who needs help. We're ready to go. What should we do now?
[4971.21s -> 4975.75s]  Go to bathroom. The bathroom. Okay. Run. Yes.
[4979.10s -> 4990.89s]  How did Tanaka manage to hide here? Under sink. Under the sink? Oh, here's the shutter key.
[4991.69s -> 5010.12s]  This will let us open that shutter. Yeah, it should. Out. Back. By the bed. Okay. Check
[5010.12s -> 5017.21s]  trunk. I am walking. Check trunk. Check trunk. It's an ordinary bed but with soft springs
[5017.29s -> 5027.96s]  in it for low gravity use. Huh. I wonder what this is. Some of the heel. Hey, a heel capsule.
[5027.96s -> 5036.39s]  There doesn't seem to be anything else. Check mirror. Stop. Yes. Check dresser. The dresser.
[5036.39s -> 5045.11s]  Okay. Check trunk. We're not going back to earth yet. We can pack our luggage later.
[5046.41s -> 5049.88s]  No, check it though. There's something down there. Check trunk.
[5050.60s -> 5059.91s]  Huh. This is a chip. All right. We are. We've made the same amount of progress we made in
[5059.91s -> 5073.77s]  40 minutes. Shoot mirror. See. Okay. I did it. Everybody calm down. Save.
[5075.34s -> 5087.10s]  Save game. Where the hell is the dumb thing? Save point. The save point. Okay. Run. Run.
[5087.10s -> 5128.39s]  Yes. Now we're good. All right. Let's go. Go. I am stopped. Go. I am stopped. Oh.
[5130.36s -> 5140.73s]  Okay. I got it already. I'm really going. Uh. Hallway. Okay. I'll leave. Run. Yes.
[5145.29s -> 5159.21s]  Go. I am stopped. Wait. We have a shutter tube. Here comes the transmission incoming.
[5160.02s -> 5166.71s]  Hello. Operator. What? Wait. I'm hearing another voice.
[5167.35s -> 5180.98s]  Who is this? Hello. Hello. Operator, can you hear me? She did. There's definitely
[5180.98s -> 5189.67s]  someone calling for help. There's someone else alive out there. Shutter seven. Shutter seven.
[5189.67s -> 5207.56s]  Okay. Here we go. Now I got to close. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. You'll be able to control the
[5207.56s -> 5212.73s]  shutter by inserting the emergency shutter key. All right. I remember this part. This time
[5212.73s -> 5233.34s]  is not going to be. I'm going to close the door on the monster. I can't even read that right
[5233.34s -> 5249.88s]  now. Shoot right eye. Back up. Back. Middle eye. Left eye. Red eye. All right. We're good.
[5255.80s -> 5259.72s]  Same thing can happen. This time I'm going to close it. Guest room two. Guest room two.
[5260.04s -> 5275.77s]  Run. Lady. Close the door on him. Save game. Tell me a story. Stop.
[5279.61s -> 5295.75s]  Turn around. Turn around. All right. I got to make sure I choose the right thing.
[5309.91s -> 5312.30s]  Close the door.
[5339.12s -> 5342.00s]  Here we go
[5343.32s -> 5348.30s]  Close
[5357.31s -> 5359.31s]  Every time it just freaks me out
[5360.11s -> 5365.08s]  You don't have to hold the gun like a baby with your finger on the trigger like that's
[5366.26s -> 5368.26s]  It's scaring me saved
[5369.06s -> 5371.18s]  Thank you
[5371.18s -> 5383.86s]  Huh, you're welcome. Can you hear footsteps?
[5384.74s -> 5391.20s]  Somebody's coming
[5391.80s -> 5397.86s]  Somebody is coming
[5400.50s -> 5402.10s]  Rio
[5402.10s -> 5408.12s]  Geno, how'd you get out of that holding cell? I had an operator open it for me
[5409.00s -> 5411.00s]  that idiot
[5411.36s -> 5416.12s]  Inside the cell no alien would have reached you. Why is everybody? I thought you died
[5418.57s -> 5422.77s]  It'll take a lot more than those aliens to kill me. I'm just a streamer
[5423.65s -> 5426.21s]  So those are aliens. Yeah, I was watching German on eight five
[5426.37s -> 5431.29s]  Fucking idiot. Hey, the good news is that a shuttle with a rescue team is on the way
[5431.29s -> 5435.93s]  I ran into a researcher in the testing ward and he said they'd caught a radio signal
[5436.85s -> 5439.63s]  I've got to tell the others about this right away
[5440.79s -> 5446.18s]  Hey operator look after her. Okay. Oh
[5446.94s -> 5448.94s]  Yeah here take this
[5449.62s -> 5454.86s]  It's the voice password for one of the suites the researcher I met he's hiding in the Sun suite
[5455.34s -> 5461.54s]  That sounds we I'm gonna keep looking for survivors make your way to the receiving port got it and be extra careful
[5461.54s -> 5463.38s]  Let's go. Let's go. I
[5463.38s -> 5464.94s]  Gotta save the game
[5464.94s -> 5471.92s]  The Sun suite. I think it's done this way
[5472.48s -> 5474.86s]  If it's a voice password, just tell her
[5475.38s -> 5480.60s]  If you could forget it the rescue team is headed for the receiving port
[5481.04s -> 5486.84s]  But the receiving port is on the other side of that spider monster
[5487.32s -> 5490.30s]  So we gotta go the other way. There's no way I can get through there
[5491.00s -> 5493.58s]  Anyway, we should search every room

[8455.87s -> 8457.31s]  Dumb person.
[8457.31s -> 8459.51s]  Look out window.

[8498.30s -> 8501.31s]  What's a chip doing here?
[8501.35s -> 8503.15s]  There's a heel capsule in the corner.
[8503.15s -> 8505.11s]  There doesn't seem to be anything else.
[8505.11s -> 8510.30s]  Let's check somewhere else.
[8510.30s -> 8511.26s]  Living area.

[8519.42s -> 8521.26s]  Check living area.
[8521.26s -> 8522.34s]  The living area.

[8529.50s -> 8531.82s]  All right.
[8531.82s -> 8533.42s]  Grab helmet.
[8533.42s -> 8534.70s]  If I put on something like this,
[8534.70s -> 8536.42s]  my hair would be totally messed up.
[8536.42s -> 8539.55s]  Do you really care about that right now?
[8539.55s -> 8540.71s]  Check helmet.
[8540.71s -> 8541.55s]  This?
[8541.55s -> 8542.39s]  Look underneath, there's probably money in there.
[8542.67s -> 8544.98s]  Engineering staff use.
[8544.98s -> 8550.05s]  It's odd to find this here.
[8550.05s -> 8552.21s]  Look at metal pipe.
[8552.21s -> 8555.48s]  But why is there a steel pipe in a guest room?
[8555.48s -> 8556.92s]  Pick up steel pipe.
[8556.92s -> 8558.26s]  I have a hand.
[8558.26s -> 8559.10s]  I won't be needing this.
[8559.10s -> 8561.79s]  But what about Melee?
[8561.79s -> 8564.46s]  Okay.
[8564.46s -> 8566.26s]  Check green box.
[8566.26s -> 8567.10s]  Are you talking about this?
[8567.10s -> 8568.10s]  That is what I'm talking about.
[8568.10s -> 8571.08s]  I'm glad you picked up on it.
[8571.08s -> 8572.72s]  Check rations.
[8572.72s -> 8575.82s]  It's the hotel's emergency rations.
[8575.82s -> 8576.66s]  Eat some.
[8576.66s -> 8578.96s]  They're stored in the equipment room.
[8578.96s -> 8579.80s]  Oh, hey.
[8579.80s -> 8581.56s]  There's a heel capsule by the rations.
[8581.64s -> 8582.48s]  Oh, hey.
[8582.48s -> 8583.32s]  I wonder who told you that?
[8583.32s -> 8586.34s]  I just came up with that on my own.
[8586.34s -> 8587.38s]  Look at corpse.
[8587.38s -> 8588.70s]  Corpse?
[8588.70s -> 8590.26s]  There's nothing like that in here.
[8590.26s -> 8593.14s]  It's behind it.
[8593.14s -> 8596.74s]  Look behind chair, couch.
[8596.74s -> 8598.06s]  What is this?
[8598.06s -> 8599.56s]  Behind.
[8599.56s -> 8603.14s]  What are you trying to say?
[8603.14s -> 8605.72s]  There isn't anything.
[8605.72s -> 8607.44s]  Look behind the chair.
[8607.44s -> 8608.32s]  Behind the chair?
[8608.32s -> 8609.40s]  Yeah.
[8609.40s -> 8614.52s]  This person's dead.
[8614.52s -> 8618.09s]  He was hiding here
[8618.09s -> 8624.09s]  in hopes of finding protection.
[8624.09s -> 8624.93s]  What was that?
[8624.93s -> 8625.77s]  Voice password.
[8625.77s -> 8626.61s]  Ooh.
[8626.61s -> 8627.45s]  Nice.
[8627.45s -> 8628.37s]  Now we can get into the Sun Suite.
[8628.37s -> 8629.78s]  Yes, we can.
[8629.78s -> 8630.62s]  Time for the Sun Suite.
[8630.62s -> 8632.22s]  Let's get over there.
[8632.22s -> 8633.38s]  Okay, let's go.
[8636.58s -> 8638.70s]  It might be way, there might be some, hold on.
[8638.70s -> 8640.22s]  Check bedroom.
[8640.22s -> 8642.06s]  The bedroom, okay.
[8642.06s -> 8644.46s]  Run, run, run.
[8644.46s -> 8646.72s]  Yes.
[8646.72s -> 8648.54s]  Check table.
[8648.54s -> 8650.02s]  Stop.
[8650.02s -> 8651.26s]  Check table.
[8651.26s -> 8652.50s]  The table, okay.
[8656.08s -> 8657.56s]  Mmm.
[8657.56s -> 8659.28s]  Turn on movie.
[8659.28s -> 8661.72s]  There's not much point in moving this.
[8661.72s -> 8663.69s]  What else should I do?
[8663.69s -> 8665.53s]  Turn on projector.
[8665.53s -> 8667.49s]  Turn on the projector?
[8667.49s -> 8670.41s]  Actually, you have to analyze the thing and turn it on.
[8670.41s -> 8672.81s]  You do it.
[8672.81s -> 8675.73s]  Well, I can't even, check projector.
[8675.73s -> 8677.57s]  And I can't even target it.
[8677.57s -> 8678.81s]  If you turn the power on for me,
[8678.81s -> 8687.50s]  it might show something.
[8687.50s -> 8691.22s]  This is the station's floor map.
[8691.22s -> 8692.06s]  This is halo.
[8692.06s -> 8692.90s]  See?
[8692.90s -> 8695.02s]  This is guest room four, where I am.
[8700.92s -> 8702.80s]  You're in the monitor room.
[8702.80s -> 8705.58s]  It's pretty far from the hotel section.
[8705.58s -> 8710.70s]  And that's the receiving port.
[8711.92s -> 8714.04s]  If Geno's story is true,
[8714.04s -> 8718.93s]  the rescue team will be arriving here.
[8718.93s -> 8721.05s]  That's new info that we didn't have before,
[8721.05s -> 8722.05s]  so I'm glad to have it.
[8722.05s -> 8722.89s]  All right.
[8722.89s -> 8724.45s]  Look at book.
[8724.45s -> 8727.52s]  What should I check?
[8727.52s -> 8728.56s]  The book.
[8728.56s -> 8730.20s]  Okay, I understand.
[8730.20s -> 8731.04s]  No, you don't.
[8731.04s -> 8733.40s]  That means, okay, every time she says I understand,
[8733.40s -> 8734.48s]  that means I don't understand.
[8734.48s -> 8735.32s]  Stop.
[8735.32s -> 8736.48s]  Yes.
[8736.48s -> 8738.43s]  Every time.
[8738.43s -> 8739.55s]  Check table.
[8739.55s -> 8740.39s]  The table.
[8740.39s -> 8745.34s]  Okay.
[8745.34s -> 8748.05s]  Look at tablecloth.
[8748.05s -> 8754.22s]  It looks like a tornado hit this place.
[8754.22s -> 8756.65s]  What?
[8756.65s -> 8759.22s]  Tablecloth on table.
[8759.22s -> 8761.18s]  What is that instruction?
[8761.18s -> 8764.27s]  I don't know what you mean.
[8764.27s -> 8766.59s]  Open tablecloth.
[8766.59s -> 8767.43s]  Are you talking about that?
[8767.43s -> 8769.47s]  Yes.
[8769.47s -> 8772.38s]  That's a blueprint?
[8772.38s -> 8776.18s]  That is a picnic tablecloth.
[8776.18s -> 8778.38s]  Look at blueprint.
[8778.38s -> 8780.95s]  It's the hotel blueprints.
[8780.95s -> 8785.51s]  This guest must have been on staff.
[8785.51s -> 8787.11s]  Check, use.
[8787.11s -> 8788.27s]  It's an ordinary chair.
[8788.27s -> 8791.67s]  I don't even know what the fuck to do with that.
[8791.67s -> 8793.07s]  Look at blueprint.
[8793.07s -> 8795.51s]  There's not much point in moving this.
[8795.51s -> 8797.73s]  What else should I do?
[8797.73s -> 8798.89s]  Green book.
[8798.89s -> 8803.39s]  Are you talking about this?
[8803.39s -> 8804.83s]  Take questionnaire.
[8804.83s -> 8806.92s]  A questionnaire?
[8806.92s -> 8810.60s]  We don't need this either.
[8810.60s -> 8813.18s]  Shoot projector.
[8813.18s -> 8816.75s]  I think it would be better if we didn't wreck this.
[8816.75s -> 8819.05s]  Shoot screen.
[8819.05s -> 8821.85s]  Putting a hole through it will make it useless.
[8821.85s -> 8823.88s]  Let's not.
[8823.88s -> 8827.50s]  Shoot mirror.
[8827.50s -> 8828.62s]  Shoot the mirror.
[8828.62s -> 8829.86s]  Are you talking about that?
[8829.86s -> 8831.26s]  Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, no.
[8831.26s -> 8832.14s]  Stop.
[8832.14s -> 8834.18s]  So I should run, OK?
[8834.18s -> 8836.34s]  No.

[8846.50s -> 8847.46s]  Check dresser.
[8847.46s -> 8848.06s]  The dresser.
[8848.06s -> 8855.12s]  Ah.

[8856.56s -> 8857.69s]  Huh?
[8857.69s -> 8862.17s]  It's just an ordinary chair.
[8862.17s -> 8864.41s]  Look at checkbook.
[8864.41s -> 8865.54s]  Huh?
[8865.54s -> 8870.26s]  It's just an ordinary chair.
[8870.26s -> 8875.18s]  Grab invitation.
[8875.18s -> 8877.62s]  This is an invitation from JSL.
[8877.62s -> 8880.50s]  So this guest must have been well-connected or pressed.
[8880.50s -> 8884.54s]  The one on the back.
[8884.54s -> 8886.06s]  Use invitation.
[8886.06s -> 8887.74s]  The invitation?
[8887.74s -> 8891.38s]  I don't know what you mean.
[8891.38s -> 8903.42s]  Shoot mirror.
[8903.42s -> 8905.17s]  You made a mess.
[8905.17s -> 8908.14s]  Are you talking about this?
[8908.14s -> 8913.33s]  Yeah, the thing that you just did.
[8913.33s -> 8915.82s]  Shoot invitation.
[8915.82s -> 8918.33s]  I will just put a hole through it.
[8918.33s -> 8921.46s]  Why do you have such a problem with shooting anything
[8921.46s -> 8923.85s]  that's not a mirror?
[8923.85s -> 8925.77s]  Do you just hate the sight of your own reflection?
[8925.77s -> 8931.73s]  I don't understand.
[8931.73s -> 8932.99s]  Leave.
[8932.99s -> 8936.42s]  Do what with what?
[8936.42s -> 8939.10s]  Go to the honeymoon suite.
[8939.10s -> 8940.30s]  I'll go out into the hallway.
[8940.30s -> 8940.78s]  What is it?
[8940.78s -> 8943.83s]  Let's put the sun suite.
[8943.83s -> 8946.64s]  Go to sun suite.
[8946.64s -> 8948.22s]  Sun suite.
[8948.22s -> 8950.74s]  Well, I still have my health.
[8950.74s -> 8952.02s]  Sun suite.
[8952.02s -> 8953.71s]  I am stopped.
[8953.71s -> 8955.87s]  Head to the sun suite.
[8955.87s -> 8958.02s]  I am stopped.
[8958.02s -> 8959.18s]  Check the bathroom.
[8959.18s -> 8959.94s]  The bathroom.
[8959.94s -> 8962.10s]  OK.
[8962.10s -> 8962.74s]  Run.
[8962.74s -> 8965.66s]  Yes.
[8965.66s -> 8967.46s]  There's nothing here.
[8967.46s -> 8970.67s]  Let's look elsewhere.
[8970.67s -> 8972.42s]  Shoot mirror.
[8972.42s -> 8974.55s]  Shoot mirror in bathroom.
[8974.55s -> 8976.50s]  Yes.

[8992.90s -> 8993.70s]  OK.

[8993.94s -> 8994.54s]  Run.
[8994.54s -> 8996.28s]  I am running.
[8996.28s -> 8996.80s]  God damn it.
[8996.80s -> 9010.90s]  Whatever.
[9010.90s -> 9011.98s]  End of stream voice.
[9011.98s -> 9019.54s]  No.
[9019.54s -> 9020.38s]  Well, I mean, look.
[9020.42s -> 9022.58s]  I did say shoot mirror.
[9022.58s -> 9025.10s]  And I see her put her hand up towards her face.
[9025.10s -> 9029.55s]  I'm just like, what the fuck is she doing?
[9029.55s -> 9032.38s]  Boo!

[9499.00s -> 9501.00s]  Even the very shadow that you cast in sunlight.
[9501.00s -> 9508.00s]  You may both enter.
[9508.00s -> 9511.00s]  Even the very shadow that you cast in sunlight.
[9511.00s -> 9513.00s]  I want to monopolize.
[9513.00s -> 9515.43s]  Authentication unsuccessful.
[9515.43s -> 9518.43s]  No!
[9518.43s -> 9522.43s]  Even the very shadow that you cast in sunlight.
[9522.43s -> 9523.43s]  No!
[9523.43s -> 9525.43s]  I need to just have it open.
[9525.43s -> 9526.43s]  Why did I close it?
[9526.43s -> 9528.43s]  There was no reason to close it.
[9528.43s -> 9533.34s]  The ride may now read the first portion.
[9533.34s -> 9535.34s]  I just keep it open.
[9535.34s -> 9539.34s]  Even the very shadow that you cast in sunlight.
[9539.34s -> 9541.34s]  Authentication successful.
[9541.34s -> 9544.34s]  The groom may now read the second portion.
[9544.34s -> 9545.34s]  I want to monopolize.
[9545.34s -> 9546.34s]  I'll get it right.
[9546.34s -> 9547.34s]  Sorry.
[9547.34s -> 9552.33s]  It's talking about you.
[9552.33s -> 9554.33s]  I want to monopolize.
[9554.33s -> 9556.46s]  Authentication successful.
[9556.46s -> 9557.46s]  Here we go.
[9557.46s -> 9561.15s]  Just read what is on the sheet.
[9561.15s -> 9565.57s]  You may both enter.
[9565.57s -> 9566.57s]  Ready?
[9566.57s -> 9567.57s]  I'm ready.
[9567.57s -> 9570.74s]  Even the very shadow that you cast in sunlight.
[9570.74s -> 9574.24s]  I want to monopolize.
[9574.24s -> 9575.24s]  Authentication successful.
[9575.24s -> 9576.24s]  Oh my god.
[9576.24s -> 9577.24s]  Get us in here.
[9577.24s -> 9578.24s]  Please enter.
[9578.24s -> 9587.74s]  We finally made it in here.
[9588.74s -> 9599.85s]  We made it to the suite.
[9599.85s -> 9601.85s]  The honeymoon suite.
[9608.67s -> 9613.67s]  That's just a bathroom tile at a beach bathroom.
[9624.57s -> 9625.57s]  Oh boy.
[9625.57s -> 9627.94s]  Coffee table.
[9627.94s -> 9635.94s]  The coffee table, okay.
[9635.94s -> 9638.11s]  Meow like a cat.
[9645.19s -> 9647.19s]  Grab coffee cup.
[9648.19s -> 9650.19s]  She just never wants to drink the coffee, ever.
[9650.19s -> 9652.82s]  Read paper.
[9659.82s -> 9665.04s]  Okay, complimentary gift in the lounge.
[9665.04s -> 9666.04s]  That's it.
[9666.04s -> 9667.04s]  This is the lounge.
[9667.04s -> 9669.04s]  Go to the lounge.
[9669.04s -> 9677.42s]  They're gonna be both just be dead on the ground here.
[9677.42s -> 9681.80s]  Alright, we got a piece of fish.
[9681.80s -> 9685.42s]  A purple circle.
[9685.42s -> 9687.42s]  It's decorated for honeymooners.
[9687.42s -> 9689.73s]  Notice all the fruit?
[9689.73s -> 9692.03s]  What kind of fruit is that?
[9692.03s -> 9693.59s]  Is it purple apple?
[9693.59s -> 9695.59s]  Grab purple apple.
[9695.59s -> 9697.59s]  Are you talking about this?
[9697.59s -> 9700.34s]  That's not a grape.
[9700.34s -> 9701.34s]  That's a huge.
[9701.34s -> 9702.34s]  That's not a plum.
[9702.34s -> 9703.34s]  Plums are way smaller than that.
[9703.34s -> 9704.34s]  Grab plum.
[9704.34s -> 9706.34s]  Are you talking about this?
[9706.34s -> 9707.34s]  Look at champagne.
[9707.34s -> 9713.28s]  Product of Champagne France.
[9713.28s -> 9715.78s]  It's a real thing.
[9715.78s -> 9717.78s]  Far from cheap.
[9717.78s -> 9720.02s]  But unfortunately empty.
[9720.02s -> 9722.38s]  You didn't want to drink the last one.
[9722.38s -> 9724.38s]  Look at fruits.
[9724.38s -> 9726.38s]  Yeah, there's all kinds of fruit.
[9726.38s -> 9729.94s]  All places to find a chip.
[9729.94s -> 9732.82s]  You can't tell me that.
[9732.82s -> 9733.82s]  What fruit?
[9733.82s -> 9735.82s]  Are those supposed to be bananas?
[9735.82s -> 9736.82s]  They don't look like bananas at all.
[9736.82s -> 9737.82s]  Alright, what about...
[9737.82s -> 9739.82s]  Look at fish.
[9739.82s -> 9740.82s]  The second floor.
[9740.82s -> 9741.82s]  Stop.
[9741.82s -> 9742.82s]  Stop.
[9743.82s -> 9744.82s]  Stop.
[9744.82s -> 9745.82s]  Yes.
[9745.82s -> 9746.82s]  Table.
[9746.82s -> 9747.82s]  The coffee table.
[9747.82s -> 9748.82s]  No, stop, stop, stop.
[9748.82s -> 9749.82s]  The second floor.
[9749.82s -> 9750.82s]  Stop.
[9750.82s -> 9751.82s]  The fruits.
[9751.82s -> 9752.82s]  The bed.
[9752.82s -> 9753.82s]  Stop.
[9753.82s -> 9754.82s]  Yes.
[9754.82s -> 9755.82s]  Check the fruits.
[9755.82s -> 9756.82s]  I am standing.
[9756.82s -> 9757.82s]  Go to the fruit table.
[9757.82s -> 9758.82s]  The coffee table.
[9758.82s -> 9760.77s]  Stop what you're doing.
[9760.77s -> 9761.77s]  The lounge.
[9761.77s -> 9762.77s]  Go to the lounge.
[9762.77s -> 9763.77s]  Okay, the lounge.
[9763.77s -> 9765.71s]  Run.
[9765.71s -> 9766.71s]  Run.
[9766.71s -> 9767.71s]  I am running.
[9767.71s -> 9774.34s]  Look at dinner plate.
[9774.34s -> 9776.52s]  I'll go out into the hallway.
[9776.52s -> 9777.52s]  Stop.
[9777.52s -> 9778.52s]  Stop, stop.
[9778.52s -> 9779.52s]  Yes.
[9779.52s -> 9780.52s]  Lounge.
[9780.52s -> 9781.52s]  The lounge.
[9781.52s -> 9782.52s]  Run.
[9782.52s -> 9785.36s]  Okay.
[9785.36s -> 9786.36s]  Yes.
[9786.36s -> 9787.36s]  Look at plate.
[9787.36s -> 9788.36s]  I've checked it earlier.
[9788.36s -> 9789.36s]  You didn't look at the plate.
[9789.36s -> 9790.73s]  That was enough.
[9790.73s -> 9791.73s]  What is that thing?
[9791.73s -> 9792.73s]  What is that supposed to be?
[9792.73s -> 9793.73s]  Look at picture.
[9793.73s -> 9794.73s]  Are you talking about this?
[9794.73s -> 9795.73s]  I thought it was food.
[9795.73s -> 9797.73s]  I thought it was a plate with a piece of fish on it.
[9797.73s -> 9798.73s]  Look at the photograph.
[9798.73s -> 9803.54s]  It's a photo of the guests from their wedding.
[9803.54s -> 9807.51s]  Everyone looks so happy.
[9807.51s -> 9808.51s]  Check couch.
[9808.51s -> 9810.51s]  I've checked it earlier.
[9810.51s -> 9812.51s]  That was enough.
[9812.51s -> 9820.32s]  Red sofa.
[9820.32s -> 9822.69s]  Check sofa.
[9822.69s -> 9825.69s]  There's more than enough room on this sofa for just a couple of people.
[9825.69s -> 9829.40s]  Oh my goodness.
[9829.40s -> 9831.40s]  Look at flowers on sofa.
[9831.40s -> 9832.40s]  I'll go out into the hallway.
[9832.40s -> 9833.40s]  Stop what you're doing.
[9833.40s -> 9835.40s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[9835.40s -> 9837.40s]  Yes.
[9837.40s -> 9838.40s]  Look at sofa.
[9838.40s -> 9839.40s]  Okay.
[9839.40s -> 9840.40s]  I'll leave.
[9840.40s -> 9841.40s]  Stop.
[9841.40s -> 9842.40s]  Yes.
[9842.40s -> 9843.40s]  Go.
[9843.40s -> 9849.61s]  Yes.
[9849.61s -> 9850.61s]  Lounge.
[9850.61s -> 9851.61s]  The lounge.
[9851.61s -> 9852.61s]  Yes.
[9852.61s -> 9859.99s]  Flowers.
[9859.99s -> 9861.99s]  Are you talking about that?
[9861.99s -> 9862.99s]  Yeah.
[9862.99s -> 9866.90s]  Look at banquet.
[9866.90s -> 9867.90s]  Look at the bouquet.
[9867.90s -> 9869.90s]  It's pretty, isn't it?
[9869.90s -> 9872.39s]  But they're fake flowers.
[9872.39s -> 9875.39s]  Real flowers can't take the stress if the G-Force is on launch.
[9875.39s -> 9879.49s]  That was completely and totally worthless.
[9879.49s -> 9880.49s]  Save point.
[9880.49s -> 9881.49s]  The save point.
[9881.49s -> 9883.92s]  Okay.
[9883.92s -> 9884.92s]  Run.
[9884.92s -> 9885.92s]  Yes.
[9885.92s -> 9891.77s]  Fake flowers.
[9891.77s -> 9892.77s]  Yeah, they are fake.
[9892.77s -> 9900.00s]  They ain't even real.
[9900.00s -> 9909.38s]  Look at banquet TV dinner meal.
[9909.38s -> 9912.99s]  Get up.
[9912.99s -> 9913.99s]  Okay.
[9913.99s -> 9914.99s]  I got it already.
[9914.99s -> 9915.99s]  Get up.
[9915.99s -> 9916.99s]  I am standing.
[9916.99s -> 9917.99s]  Go upstairs.
[9917.99s -> 9918.99s]  The second floor.
[9918.99s -> 9919.99s]  Okay.
[9919.99s -> 9922.19s]  No.
[9922.19s -> 9923.50s]  Don't.
[9923.50s -> 9925.63s]  Hello.
[9925.63s -> 9927.06s]  Bathroom.
[9927.06s -> 9928.06s]  The bathroom.
[9928.06s -> 9929.06s]  Run.
[9929.06s -> 9935.49s]  Yes.
[9935.49s -> 9936.49s]  Dead person in the bathtub.
[9936.49s -> 9938.37s]  What?
[9938.37s -> 9939.37s]  Oh my God.
[9939.37s -> 9940.37s]  They must be the guest couple.
[9940.37s -> 9950.12s]  Looks like they tried to hide in here.
[9950.12s -> 9951.12s]  I can't bear to look.
[9951.12s -> 9952.12s]  Why are they carrying...
[9952.12s -> 9954.12s]  Let's check somewhere else.
[9954.12s -> 9955.12s]  Yeah, I know.
[9955.12s -> 9956.12s]  Get in bath.
[9956.12s -> 9957.12s]  The bathroom.
[9957.12s -> 9958.12s]  Okay.
[9958.12s -> 9960.49s]  I can't bear to look.
[9960.49s -> 9961.49s]  Let's check somewhere else.
[9961.49s -> 9963.62s]  There's nothing in there?
[9963.62s -> 9967.98s]  Nothing at all.
[9967.98s -> 9972.11s]  There's nothing in the bathtub or the bathroom.
[9972.11s -> 9973.11s]  Go upstairs.
[9973.11s -> 9974.11s]  The second floor.
[9974.11s -> 9975.11s]  Run.
[9975.11s -> 9977.18s]  Okay.
[9977.18s -> 9978.18s]  Yes.
[9978.18s -> 9979.18s]  The mirror's already broken.
[9979.18s -> 9980.18s]  Yeah, I didn't have to do anything.
[9980.18s -> 9981.18s]  It's already shattered for me.
[9981.18s -> 9983.18s]  Maybe a monster's gonna be up here.
[9983.18s -> 9988.97s]  That thing.
[9988.97s -> 9990.27s]  It can't be.
[9990.27s -> 9993.60s]  Who else is up here?
[9993.60s -> 9999.30s]  This dude looks still alive.
[9999.30s -> 10000.98s]  We were too late.
[10000.98s -> 10006.95s]  Operator, I don't think we're gonna get any information from this researcher.
[10006.95s -> 10008.95s]  What couldn't you ask me?
[10008.95s -> 10009.95s]  What?
[10009.95s -> 10010.95s]  Stop, stop.
[10010.95s -> 10011.95s]  Wait a second.
[10011.95s -> 10012.95s]  I'm human.
[10012.95s -> 10014.95s]  Pretending to be dead?
[10014.95s -> 10016.51s]  Hey, I'm sorry.
[10016.51s -> 10019.51s]  I thought that an alien had come in here.
[10019.51s -> 10022.51s]  I don't have any useful weapons, so the only thing I could do was play dead.
[10022.51s -> 10025.51s]  I'm Alan Honda, a researcher.
[10025.51s -> 10028.51s]  Can you maybe lower that gun?
[10028.51s -> 10030.51s]  I'm human.
[10031.51s -> 10033.51s]  Hey, I'll admit to being a little weird.
[10033.51s -> 10036.51s]  First person that says they're human usually isn't.
[10036.51s -> 10039.74s]  Did you just say alien?
[10039.74s -> 10040.74s]  Snake skin alien.
[10040.74s -> 10043.49s]  You really think those were aliens?
[10043.49s -> 10044.49s]  Huh?
[10044.49s -> 10048.29s]  What do you mean by that?
[10048.29s -> 10049.29s]  Well, I get it.
[10049.29s -> 10051.29s]  I see the significance of that question.
[10051.29s -> 10056.46s]  Are you maybe thinking that we screwed up our experiments and made the aliens?
[10056.46s -> 10059.46s]  Oh, that's one of those games.
[10059.46s -> 10061.96s]  Oh, for Pete's sake.
[10061.96s -> 10069.14s]  You think I like going to the children's department in the store and buying the
[10069.14s -> 10070.14s]  kid's vest?
[10070.14s -> 10071.14s]  No.
[10071.14s -> 10073.14s]  But I do it anyway.
[10099.14s -> 10105.14s]  If you're so interested in our research, I'll give you some reference material.
[10105.14s -> 10111.78s]  That was a gun.
[10111.78s -> 10114.78s]  You ran into that spider, right?
[10114.78s -> 10115.78s]  Uh huh.
[10115.78s -> 10117.78s]  How did you get away from it?
[10117.78s -> 10120.21s]  Please tell me.
[10120.21s -> 10123.86s]  How to kill the spider.
[10123.86s -> 10125.86s]  With that?
[10125.86s -> 10126.86s]  But it's out of fuel now.
[10126.86s -> 10127.86s]  New weapon?
[10127.86s -> 10128.86s]  Is it a flamethrower?
[10128.86s -> 10129.86s]  That thing is huge.
[10129.86s -> 10130.86s]  Do I get to flamethrow mirrors now?
[10130.86s -> 10133.86s]  But it seems to share similarities with Earth's arthropod, a spider.
[10133.86s -> 10135.86s]  You scared it off with fire.
[10135.86s -> 10138.86s]  So it's vulnerable against fire.
[10138.86s -> 10139.86s]  Uh huh.
[10139.86s -> 10142.86s]  Until help arrives, I'm holing up in here.
[10142.86s -> 10146.86s]  Earlier, Research Supervisor Powers sent a rescue signal.
[10146.86s -> 10151.86s]  Powers told me to spread the word, so I came to tell the others, but...
[10151.86s -> 10157.03s]  Because of that monster spider, you can't make it to the receiving port?
[10157.03s -> 10158.03s]  Bingo.
[10158.03s -> 10160.03s]  It's a nasty obstacle.
[10160.03s -> 10162.03s]  So, uh, how about it?
[10162.03s -> 10164.03s]  Wanna play dead with me?
[10164.03s -> 10165.03s]  I'm going.
[10165.03s -> 10168.03s]  I have a partner backing me up.
[10168.03s -> 10169.03s]  Right?
[10169.03s -> 10173.03s]  Whoa, hang on.
[10173.03s -> 10175.03s]  Take this with you.
[10175.03s -> 10179.26s]  Shutter key.
[10179.26s -> 10183.48s]  Do you really intend to just play dead?
[10183.48s -> 10187.23s]  Please refrain from talking to me.
[10187.23s -> 10189.23s]  Okay, whatever.
[10189.23s -> 10193.56s]  The Research Supervisor really sent for help.
[10193.56s -> 10196.56s]  I guess the rescue team is already on the way.
[10198.38s -> 10201.38s]  That means everyone will gather in the receiving port.
[10201.38s -> 10203.43s]  What the fu-
[10203.43s -> 10205.43s]  Gino said that he'd tell the others.
[10205.43s -> 10208.43s]  Both Helen and Naomi may be at the receiving port.
[10208.43s -> 10213.14s]  I think we should be making our way to the receiving port too.
[10213.14s -> 10215.14s]  How many times can you say receiving port in the same?
[10215.14s -> 10218.14s]  We have to get rid of that monster spider if I'm gonna get to the receiving port.
[10218.14s -> 10219.14s]  There's five.
[10219.14s -> 10221.14s]  That flamethrower Alan had.
[10221.14s -> 10223.14s]  It came from the equipment room.
[10223.14s -> 10225.14s]  There should be more at the same.
[10225.14s -> 10226.14s]  Yep.
[10226.14s -> 10228.14s]  I think we better check out the equipment room.
[10228.14s -> 10230.45s]  To the receiving port.
[10230.45s -> 10231.45s]  Oh no, you changed it to equipment room.
[10231.45s -> 10232.45s]  Alright.
[10232.45s -> 10237.54s]  Looks like we have to go to the equipment room.
[10237.54s -> 10238.54s]  Leave.
[10238.54s -> 10239.54s]  Yes.
[10239.54s -> 10240.54s]  Run.
[10240.54s -> 10241.54s]  Yes.
[10241.54s -> 10242.54s]  Leave.
[10242.54s -> 10243.54s]  Hallway.
[10243.54s -> 10244.54s]  Okay.
[10244.54s -> 10246.30s]  I'll leave.
[10246.30s -> 10247.30s]  Save point.
[10247.30s -> 10248.30s]  The save point.
[10248.30s -> 10249.30s]  Run.
[10249.30s -> 10253.42s]  Okay.
[10253.42s -> 10254.42s]  Yes.
[10254.42s -> 10255.42s]  Do I have a key?
[10255.42s -> 10265.10s]  I don't think I have one of those door opening keys.
[10265.10s -> 10283.07s]  Oh, it gave one to me.
[10283.07s -> 10284.07s]  I am stopped.
[10284.07s -> 10287.30s]  Up.
[10287.30s -> 10288.30s]  The bed.
[10288.30s -> 10290.88s]  Hallway.
[10290.88s -> 10291.88s]  Okay.
[10291.88s -> 10292.88s]  Run.
[10292.88s -> 10309.29s]  Yes.
[10309.29s -> 10310.29s]  Where should I go?
[10310.29s -> 10313.23s]  You need to go to the equipment.
[10313.23s -> 10314.23s]  Alright.
[10314.23s -> 10315.23s]  Shutter two.
[10315.23s -> 10316.41s]  Shutter two.
[10316.41s -> 10317.41s]  Okay.
[10317.41s -> 10318.41s]  Run.
[10318.41s -> 10319.97s]  Run.
[10319.97s -> 10331.45s]  Yes.
[10331.45s -> 10333.65s]  Alright.
[10333.65s -> 10334.65s]  Equipment room.
[10334.65s -> 10335.65s]  This will open that shutter.
[10335.65s -> 10336.65s]  Activate the flamethrower.
[10336.65s -> 10337.65s]  Flamethrow the spider.
[10337.65s -> 10338.65s]  We have to analyze.
[10338.65s -> 10340.91s]  Geez.
[10340.91s -> 10343.69s]  Pushy.
[10343.69s -> 10344.69s]  And then two.
[10344.69s -> 10351.85s]  There should be a flamethrower in the equipment room.
[10351.85s -> 10353.09s]  Check.
[10353.09s -> 10355.61s]  Hey.
[10355.61s -> 10356.61s]  Wait, wait, hey.
[10356.61s -> 10358.36s]  I didn't tell you to do that.
[10358.36s -> 10360.36s]  Since when do you make decisions on your own?
[10360.36s -> 10364.16s]  It's getting dark.
[10364.16s -> 10366.59s]  The power must be weakening.
[10366.59s -> 10372.03s]  We always confer with each other.
[10372.03s -> 10375.03s]  A flamethrower would be in the mechanical unit.
[10375.03s -> 10378.10s]  Where was that camera?
[10378.10s -> 10379.10s]  Great.
[10379.10s -> 10380.10s]  Hopefully there's some fuel left.
[10380.10s -> 10381.10s]  Did you see that crane shot?
[10381.10s -> 10382.10s]  Where was she looking?
[10382.10s -> 10383.10s]  What camera was that?
[10383.10s -> 10384.79s]  Huh?
[10384.79s -> 10385.79s]  No fuel?
[10385.79s -> 10387.79s]  Oh man, it's completely empty.
[10387.79s -> 10391.57s]  This won't do.
[10391.57s -> 10394.06s]  Am I like a floating little robot?
[10394.06s -> 10395.37s]  Listen.
[10395.37s -> 10397.12s]  See?
[10397.12s -> 10402.75s]  I think we have to give up on that flamethrower.
[10402.75s -> 10403.75s]  There's no fuel.
[10403.75s -> 10405.75s]  The tank is empty.
[10405.75s -> 10407.75s]  There's nothing we can do.
[10407.75s -> 10414.50s]  To get to the other side of that shutter, we have to kill that spider.
[10414.50s -> 10418.50s]  The flamethrower that Alan had been using is worthless now.
[10418.50s -> 10419.80s]  What?
[10419.80s -> 10422.80s]  That giant spider is vulnerable to fire.
[10422.80s -> 10427.13s]  Let's look for a weapon that involves fire.
[10427.13s -> 10428.13s]  You mean a flamethrower?
[10428.13s -> 10429.13s]  That's the only thing we can do.
[10429.13s -> 10432.13s]  Did they just not want to develop the fire coming out of the flamethrower?
[10432.13s -> 10441.74s]  Hey, what's an item that uses fire and can do fire damage?
[10441.74s -> 10442.74s]  A flamethrower.
[10442.74s -> 10443.74s]  Well, you know, but we can't use that.
[10443.74s -> 10445.74s]  So what else does fire?
[10445.74s -> 10446.74s]  I don't know.
[10446.74s -> 10447.74s]  A fire?
[10447.74s -> 10449.74s]  Start a fire.
[10449.74s -> 10451.18s]  Where are you going?
[10451.18s -> 10452.18s]  Supply unit.
[10452.18s -> 10453.18s]  The supply unit.
[10453.18s -> 10454.18s]  Okay.
[10454.18s -> 10457.40s]  God.
[10457.40s -> 10459.28s]  Left boxes.
[10459.28s -> 10460.28s]  Check.
[10460.28s -> 10464.31s]  These are ventilation fan parts.
[10464.31s -> 10471.54s]  Item on top of the shelf.
[10471.54s -> 10474.54s]  Have you forgotten that I work here?
[10474.54s -> 10477.54s]  Don't expect me to go shooting the hotel's supplies.
[10477.54s -> 10482.38s]  Selective shooting for some reason.
[10482.38s -> 10484.38s]  Item on left shelf.
[10484.38s -> 10487.38s]  Have you forgotten that I work here?
[10487.38s -> 10490.38s]  Don't expect me to go shooting the hotel's supplies.
[10490.38s -> 10494.54s]  Get on scaffolding.
[10494.54s -> 10495.54s]  Geez.
[10495.54s -> 10498.54s]  You're expecting me to pick up everything, aren't you?
[10498.54s -> 10499.54s]  No way.
[10499.54s -> 10500.54s]  I can't pick that up.
[10500.54s -> 10506.57s]  Get on the...
[10506.57s -> 10507.57s]  Okay.
[10507.57s -> 10508.57s]  Thank you.
[10508.57s -> 10509.57s]  Let's check what's up top.
[10509.57s -> 10510.57s]  Okay, you've got the controls.
[10510.57s -> 10517.44s]  Up we go.
[10517.44s -> 10539.03s]  That would hurt.
[10539.03s -> 10542.03s]  That would hurt really bad.
[10542.03s -> 10548.92s]  Smashed her head against the ceiling.
[10548.92s -> 10550.22s]  All right.
[10550.22s -> 10551.22s]  What am I looking for?
[10551.22s -> 10552.22s]  I said the middle shelf is suspicious.
[10552.22s -> 10558.06s]  Wait.
[10558.06s -> 10561.06s]  There's something suspicious about that shelf I just passed.
[10561.06s -> 10562.06s]  Stay there.
[10562.06s -> 10563.06s]  Stop.
[10563.06s -> 10564.06s]  I'm not doing anything.
[10564.06s -> 10565.36s]  I said the middle shelf is suspicious.
[10565.36s -> 10566.36s]  Oh my God.
[10566.36s -> 10567.36s]  I'm not doing anything.
[10567.36s -> 10572.57s]  I swear to God.
[10572.57s -> 10574.64s]  Stop.
[10574.64s -> 10575.64s]  The middle shelf is...
[10575.64s -> 10576.64s]  I can't stop at the middle shelf.
[10576.64s -> 10587.73s]  This lift is scary, so don't say anything weird, please.
[10591.66s -> 10592.66s]  Press enter.
[10592.66s -> 10599.12s]  This lift is scary, so don't say anything weird, please.
[10599.12s -> 10600.12s]  Enter.
[10600.12s -> 10601.12s]  Okay.
[10601.12s -> 10608.03s]  Then lower the lift.
[10608.03s -> 10611.03s]  This lift is scary, so don't say anything weird, please.
[10611.03s -> 10612.03s]  I did.
[10612.03s -> 10613.03s]  I'm sorry.
[10613.03s -> 10614.59s]  Get off.
[10614.59s -> 10615.59s]  Look.
[10615.59s -> 10616.59s]  Forward.
[10616.59s -> 10619.59s]  This lift is scary, so don't say anything weird, please.
[10619.59s -> 10620.59s]  Check.
[10620.59s -> 10627.12s]  There's nothing on the shelf that we can use for lighting a fire.
[10627.12s -> 10628.12s]  Whoa.
[10628.12s -> 10629.12s]  You did it again.
[10629.12s -> 10630.12s]  Take it easy.
[10630.12s -> 10631.12s]  Whoa.
[10631.12s -> 10632.12s]  That was too close.
[10632.12s -> 10633.12s]  Control it better.
[10633.12s -> 10634.12s]  I can't go right.
[10634.12s -> 10635.12s]  Why not?
[10635.12s -> 10636.12s]  Whoa.
[10636.12s -> 10637.12s]  I did it again.
[10637.12s -> 10638.12s]  Take it easy.
[10638.12s -> 10657.09s]  Check.
[10657.09s -> 10667.84s]  I looked carefully, but there's nothing here that we need.
[10667.84s -> 10668.84s]  Nothing?
[10668.84s -> 10670.78s]  Check.
[10670.78s -> 10680.96s]  There's nothing on the shelf that we can use for lighting a fire.
[10680.96s -> 10681.96s]  Listen.
[10681.96s -> 10682.96s]  Listen.
[10682.96s -> 10687.96s]  I know you probably don't get this, but I can't put you in the middle.
[10687.96s -> 10690.96s]  For some reason, it won't let me.
[10690.96s -> 10692.14s]  The utility unit.
[10692.14s -> 10693.14s]  Okay.
[10693.14s -> 10700.01s]  Stop.
[10700.01s -> 10701.01s]  Yes.
[10701.01s -> 10702.38s]  Go back to supply unit.
[10702.38s -> 10703.38s]  The supply unit.
[10703.38s -> 10704.38s]  Run.
[10704.38s -> 10705.38s]  Okay.
[10705.38s -> 10708.92s]  I am running.
[10708.92s -> 10710.16s]  So this...
[10710.16s -> 10711.16s]  Get on.
[10711.16s -> 10712.16s]  Okay.
[10712.16s -> 10713.16s]  Let's check what's up top.
[10713.16s -> 10714.16s]  Okay.
[10714.16s -> 10715.16s]  You've got the controls.
[10715.16s -> 10732.90s]  Jump.
[10732.90s -> 10733.90s]  You would think I could just go this way from here.
[10733.90s -> 10734.90s]  Whoa.
[10734.90s -> 10735.90s]  That was too close.
[10735.90s -> 10736.90s]  Control it better.
[10736.90s -> 10737.90s]  Use.
[10737.90s -> 10747.58s]  Check.
[10747.58s -> 10748.58s]  Check.
[10748.58s -> 10749.58s]  Check.
[10749.58s -> 10752.42s]  Check.
[10752.42s -> 10754.43s]  I can't.
[10754.43s -> 10757.43s]  I can't check a shelf properly unless I'm squarely in front of it.
[10757.43s -> 10758.43s]  Use the X button?
[10758.43s -> 10760.06s]  No.
[10760.06s -> 10765.39s]  Enter doesn't do anything.
[10765.39s -> 10766.39s]  There is no, like, enter.
[10766.39s -> 10767.82s]  Wait.
[10767.82s -> 10771.26s]  There's something suspicious about that shelf I just passed.
[10771.26s -> 10772.26s]  Go diagonal.
[10772.26s -> 10773.26s]  Try from the left again.
[10773.26s -> 10774.26s]  That was too close.
[10774.26s -> 10786.63s]  Control it better.
[10786.63s -> 10795.23s]  Can I do this?
[10795.23s -> 10796.23s]  Enter on the PlayStation 2 controller is...
[10796.23s -> 10811.87s]  What, though?
[10811.87s -> 10812.87s]  Does none of these buttons do anything?
[10812.87s -> 10813.87s]  Circle is talk.
[10813.87s -> 10830.44s]  I can't check a shelf properly unless I'm squarely in front of it.
[10831.44s -> 10832.44s]  Diagonally?
[10832.44s -> 10839.06s]  Okay.
[10839.06s -> 10846.86s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[10846.86s -> 10847.86s]  What?
[10847.86s -> 10849.93s]  No way that that works.
[10849.93s -> 10851.93s]  There's no way that that works.
[10851.93s -> 10856.47s]  Are you serious?
[10856.47s -> 10870.36s]  Come on.
[10870.36s -> 10877.18s]  It actually fucking works.
[10877.18s -> 10878.18s]  How...
[10878.18s -> 10884.18s]  There's no way I would have been able to ever assume that I could go diagonal.
[10884.18s -> 10885.18s]  I've got four.
[10885.18s -> 10890.98s]  One, two, three, four.
[10890.98s -> 10893.38s]  Check.
[10893.38s -> 10896.38s]  There's nothing on the shelf that we can use for lighting a fire.
[10896.38s -> 10902.12s]  I can't believe it.
[10902.12s -> 10903.74s]  Check.
[10903.74s -> 10904.74s]  That's unbelievable.
[10904.74s -> 10905.74s]  This magnesium chip.
[10905.74s -> 10908.14s]  Let's see.
[10908.14s -> 10909.14s]  What does it say?
[10909.14s -> 10912.14s]  Warnings for magnesium chip usage.
[10912.14s -> 10915.57s]  One, keep out of reach of children.
[10915.57s -> 10920.57s]  Two, avoid direct sunlight and temperature over 50 degrees Celsius.
[10920.57s -> 10922.57s]  Do not incinerate.
[10922.57s -> 10928.57s]  Three, hold away from face while igniting and confirm that it is extinguished.
[10928.57s -> 10931.57s]  Four, that's enough, huh?
[10931.57s -> 10933.57s]  In other words, it's like a lighter.
[10933.57s -> 10936.57s]  It won't make a weapon, but I can use it for lighting a fire.
[10936.57s -> 10938.57s]  So throw that.
[10938.57s -> 10940.57s]  What the hell is that thing called?
[10940.57s -> 10942.38s]  Magnesium.
[10942.38s -> 10943.38s]  I got the magnesium.
[10943.38s -> 10946.99s]  Off.
[10946.99s -> 10951.68s]  I can't check a shelf properly unless I'm squarely in front of it.
[10951.68s -> 10954.24s]  Get off.
[10954.24s -> 10955.24s]  Off.
[10955.24s -> 10957.24s]  Yes, maybe we should go somewhere else.
[10957.24s -> 10961.63s]  So I'm going to say throw magnesium at Spider.
[10961.63s -> 10963.63s]  So we got supply unit, food unit.
[10963.63s -> 10964.63s]  The food unit.
[10964.63s -> 10965.63s]  OK.
[10965.63s -> 10968.92s]  Run.
[10968.92s -> 10969.92s]  Yes.
[10969.92s -> 10979.14s]  This is another one of these dumb scaffolding puzzles.
[10979.14s -> 10981.14s]  This unit only has preserved food.
[10981.14s -> 10983.14s]  There's no need to check this.
[10983.14s -> 10984.14s]  Let's go.
[10984.14s -> 10985.82s]  OK.
[10985.82s -> 10989.09s]  It's apparently that easy.
[10989.09s -> 10990.09s]  Mechanical unit.
[10990.09s -> 10991.09s]  The mechanical unit.
[10991.09s -> 10992.09s]  OK.
[10992.09s -> 10995.82s]  Run.
[10995.82s -> 10998.98s]  Yes.
[10998.98s -> 10999.98s]  Oh, no.
[10999.98s -> 11008.59s]  Time thrower, shelf, shelf, power panel, out of order.
[11008.59s -> 11009.59s]  Fix power panel.
[11009.59s -> 11014.88s]  I'd feel bad if I were to wreck this anymore.
[11014.88s -> 11015.88s]  Utility unit.
[11015.88s -> 11016.88s]  Utility unit.
[11016.88s -> 11017.88s]  Run.
[11017.88s -> 11018.88s]  I gotcha.
[11018.88s -> 11023.87s]  The shelf on the other side.
[11023.87s -> 11024.87s]  Run.
[11024.87s -> 11031.36s]  Yes.
[11031.36s -> 11032.60s]  Get on.
[11032.60s -> 11033.60s]  OK.
[11033.60s -> 11034.60s]  Let's check what's up top.
[11034.60s -> 11035.60s]  OK.
[11035.60s -> 11039.40s]  You've got the controls.
[11039.40s -> 11044.61s]  Do I?
[11044.61s -> 11048.41s]  I do.
[11048.41s -> 11049.41s]  Voltage at 50%.
[11049.41s -> 11050.41s]  The power supply is unstable.
[11050.41s -> 11052.41s]  Please raise the voltage to 100.
[11073.02s -> 11074.02s]  I can't go anywhere.
[11074.02s -> 11075.02s]  I think I have to raise the power.
[11092.46s -> 11093.46s]  Nothing works.
[11096.32s -> 11097.32s]  Check.
[11097.32s -> 11100.62s]  If you want me to check the lower shelves, I won't need the lift.
[11100.62s -> 11102.62s]  So how is this even possible?
[11105.77s -> 11106.77s]  I mean, top?
[11106.77s -> 11107.77s]  From here?
[11107.77s -> 11108.77s]  No.
[11108.77s -> 11109.77s]  From here?
[11109.77s -> 11110.77s]  No.
[11110.77s -> 11111.77s]  I gotta get off.
[11111.77s -> 11112.77s]  Get off.
[11112.77s -> 11113.77s]  Yes.
[11113.77s -> 11114.77s]  I think we should go somewhere else.
[11116.71s -> 11122.22s]  Turn the other one off.
[11122.22s -> 11126.46s]  Supply unit.
[11126.46s -> 11127.46s]  The supply unit.
[11127.46s -> 11128.46s]  OK.
[11128.46s -> 11137.68s]  Maybe that'll defer power?
[11138.68s -> 11140.69s]  Utility unit.
[11140.69s -> 11141.93s]  Utility unit.
[11142.93s -> 11143.93s]  I gotcha.
[11143.93s -> 11144.93s]  Run.
[11144.93s -> 11145.93s]  The shelf on the other side.
[11145.93s -> 11147.74s]  Run.
[11147.74s -> 11148.74s]  Run.
[11148.74s -> 11149.74s]  Yes.
[11149.74s -> 11159.98s]  Did it say the power?
[11159.98s -> 11161.29s]  Get on.
[11161.29s -> 11162.85s]  OK.
[11162.85s -> 11164.85s]  Let's check what's up top.
[11164.85s -> 11165.85s]  OK.
[11165.85s -> 11166.85s]  You've got the controls.
[11166.85s -> 11168.41s]  I wonder if that worked.
[11168.41s -> 11173.55s]  Yeah.
[11173.55s -> 11174.55s]  It did.
[11174.55s -> 11176.30s]  Wow.
[11176.30s -> 11178.86s]  It's pretty remarkable actually.
[11178.86s -> 11179.86s]  Check.
[11179.86s -> 11181.04s]  This.
[11181.04s -> 11183.30s]  It's a chip.
[11183.30s -> 11187.62s]  It's pretty sweet.
[11187.62s -> 11191.93s]  Check.
[11191.93s -> 11196.26s]  I looked carefully, but there's nothing here that we need.
[11198.97s -> 11201.91s]  Running to a wall here.
[11201.91s -> 11204.30s]  Nothing else?
[11204.30s -> 11205.30s]  Check.
[11205.30s -> 11209.57s]  There's nothing on the shelf that we can use for lighting a fire.
[11210.57s -> 11212.00s]  I think that's it.
[11212.00s -> 11213.00s]  Jesus.
[11213.00s -> 11214.00s]  That was too close.
[11214.00s -> 11215.00s]  Control it better.
[11215.00s -> 11222.00s]  Get off.
[11222.00s -> 11223.00s]  Yes.
[11223.00s -> 11224.00s]  Maybe we should go somewhere else.
[11226.20s -> 11228.20s]  So that was data unit.
[11228.20s -> 11229.20s]  Data unit.
[11229.20s -> 11230.20s]  The data unit.
[11230.20s -> 11231.20s]  OK.
[11231.20s -> 11232.20s]  Run.
[11232.20s -> 11233.20s]  Yes.
[11236.62s -> 11238.24s]  Check note.
[11238.24s -> 11240.95s]  What is this?
[11240.95s -> 11241.95s]  Oh, that's the...
[11241.95s -> 11242.95s]  This diagram.
[11242.95s -> 11243.95s]  That's the thing that describes...
[11243.95s -> 11245.95s]  Is it just some doodling by the staff?
[11245.95s -> 11247.95s]  That's the solution to the puzzle.
[11247.95s -> 11251.50s]  OK.
[11251.50s -> 11252.50s]  That's great.
[11252.50s -> 11256.23s]  Look at left.
[11256.23s -> 11259.23s]  How am I supposed to understand that?
[11259.23s -> 11261.75s]  What is that thing?
[11261.75s -> 11262.75s]  Look at dolly.
[11262.75s -> 11263.75s]  Leave the room?
[11263.75s -> 11264.75s]  No.
[11264.75s -> 11265.75s]  OK.
[11265.75s -> 11267.06s]  Stop.
[11267.06s -> 11268.87s]  Go back.
[11268.87s -> 11269.87s]  Stop.
[11269.87s -> 11270.87s]  Yep.
[11270.87s -> 11271.87s]  Go to data panel.
[11271.87s -> 11272.87s]  The data unit.
[11272.87s -> 11273.87s]  OK.
[11273.87s -> 11277.01s]  Check left panel.
[11277.01s -> 11281.00s]  No go.
[11281.00s -> 11284.00s]  It's not working properly because it's not getting enough power.
[11284.00s -> 11288.75s]  If this was working properly, it would have been easy to check this room.
[11290.44s -> 11294.43s]  OK.
[11294.43s -> 11297.04s]  Look at platform.
[11297.04s -> 11301.37s]  It's a cart for delivering supplies to various sections.
[11301.37s -> 11303.37s]  It's for staff use.
[11303.37s -> 11305.95s]  That's it.
[11305.95s -> 11306.95s]  All right.
[11306.95s -> 11307.95s]  I think we can get out of here.
[11307.95s -> 11308.95s]  Safe point.
[11308.95s -> 11309.95s]  OK.
[11309.95s -> 11310.95s]  The safe point.
[11310.95s -> 11313.28s]  We got the fire.
[11313.28s -> 11314.28s]  We can kill the bug.
[11314.28s -> 11315.28s]  I am walking.
[11315.28s -> 11321.06s]  Mine Bitcoin.
[11321.06s -> 11322.06s]  I'm not going to say that.
[11322.06s -> 11329.96s]  Get up.
[11329.96s -> 11335.17s]  OK.
[11335.17s -> 11336.17s]  I got it already.
[11336.17s -> 11337.17s]  Leave.
[11337.17s -> 11340.97s]  Into the hallway.
[11340.97s -> 11341.97s]  OK.
[11341.97s -> 11342.97s]  I'll leave.
[11342.97s -> 11343.97s]  Go.
[11343.97s -> 11344.97s]  Did you say something?
[11344.97s -> 11345.97s]  Hallway.
[11345.97s -> 11348.86s]  OK.
[11348.86s -> 11349.86s]  I'll leave.
[11349.86s -> 11350.86s]  Be nice to her.
[11350.86s -> 11351.86s]  Where should I go?
[11351.86s -> 11362.10s]  Be nice to her.
[11362.10s -> 11369.82s]  So now we go to infirmary.
[11369.82s -> 11370.82s]  The infirmary.
[11370.82s -> 11371.82s]  OK.
[11371.82s -> 11386.47s]  This is the infirmary.
[11386.47s -> 11391.06s]  This is actually the first time I've ever been here.
[11391.06s -> 11394.54s]  Ha ha.
[11394.54s -> 11395.54s]  That'd be funny.
[11395.54s -> 11396.54s]  Ha ha.
[11396.54s -> 11397.54s]  Ha ha.
[11397.54s -> 11398.54s]  What?
[11398.54s -> 11399.97s]  A way to kill that spider.
[11399.97s -> 11400.97s]  I already have it.
[11400.97s -> 11401.97s]  Listen, operator.
[11401.97s -> 11405.53s]  What do you associate with an infirmary?
[11405.53s -> 11409.53s]  Can you name the sorts of things that you'd find in an infirmary?
[11409.53s -> 11412.79s]  Sure.
[11412.79s -> 11413.79s]  Medicine.
[11413.79s -> 11415.29s]  Medicine.
[11415.29s -> 11419.53s]  In a room this big, there should be all sorts.
[11419.53s -> 11422.92s]  Anything else?
[11422.92s -> 11425.92s]  A doctor.
[11425.92s -> 11427.29s]  Yep.
[11427.29s -> 11428.29s]  You bet.
[11428.29s -> 11429.29s]  There'd be a doctor.
[11429.29s -> 11430.29s]  Definitely.
[11430.29s -> 11434.00s]  Are there any others?
[11434.00s -> 11437.48s]  Turkey.
[11437.48s -> 11438.48s]  Thanksgiving turkey.
[11438.48s -> 11439.48s]  Christmas turkey.
[11439.48s -> 11444.37s]  A football.
[11444.37s -> 11449.57s]  Tell me some things you'd find in an infirmary.
[11449.57s -> 11451.32s]  A lawyer.
[11451.32s -> 11452.32s]  Oh.
[11452.32s -> 11453.32s]  Barium.
[11453.32s -> 11455.94s]  I absolutely loathe the idea.
[11455.94s -> 11456.94s]  Did you just say...
[11456.94s -> 11458.94s]  Can't they find a better way to...
[11458.94s -> 11459.94s]  Barium?
[11459.94s -> 11460.94s]  Come on.
[11460.94s -> 11461.94s]  More guesses.
[11461.94s -> 11468.88s]  Barium?
[11468.88s -> 11469.88s]  Surgery tools.
[11469.88s -> 11471.25s]  Uh, yeah.
[11471.25s -> 11472.25s]  Bedpan.
[11472.25s -> 11476.64s]  Are there any more?
[11476.64s -> 11478.84s]  Yes, Dora.
[11478.84s -> 11486.93s]  Let me see.
[11486.93s -> 11487.93s]  Syringes.
[11487.93s -> 11489.42s]  A syringe.
[11489.42s -> 11490.42s]  I hate them.
[11490.42s -> 11493.42s]  Can you manage one more guess?
[11493.42s -> 11507.86s]  Stuff you'd find in an infirmary.
[11512.93s -> 11513.93s]  Alcohol?
[11513.93s -> 11515.81s]  No.
[11515.81s -> 11519.81s]  I mean, alcohol, but not really.
[11519.81s -> 11521.30s]  Alcohol.
[11521.30s -> 11522.74s]  Yeah.
[11522.74s -> 11527.36s]  Disinfectant always stings on cuts or scrapes.
[11527.36s -> 11529.98s]  Yeah, let's see.
[11529.98s -> 11534.95s]  Being a medical room, there should be chemicals here.
[11534.95s -> 11539.43s]  Chemicals.
[11539.43s -> 11541.43s]  A flamethrower.
[11541.43s -> 11543.82s]  Oh.
[11543.82s -> 11544.82s]  Listen, operator.
[11544.82s -> 11547.82s]  There's gotta be a weapon we can use to kill that spider.
[11547.82s -> 11549.58s]  Chemical fire.
[11549.58s -> 11551.58s]  Alright, let's put it together.
[11551.58s -> 11553.58s]  That weapon's name...
[11553.58s -> 11555.52s]  A flamethrower.
[11555.52s -> 11556.52s]  What was it now?
[11556.52s -> 11558.52s]  You don't remember the flamethrower?
[11558.52s -> 11561.66s]  What was its name now?
[11561.66s -> 11563.66s]  I can't talk.
[11563.66s -> 11564.66s]  What was it called?
[11564.66s -> 11565.66s]  That thing.
[11565.66s -> 11567.66s]  I can't remember.
[11567.66s -> 11569.41s]  Hey, operator.
[11569.41s -> 11572.41s]  Can you name some weapons that you know?
[11572.41s -> 11575.22s]  Grenade.
[11575.22s -> 11577.22s]  A grenade or something?
[11577.22s -> 11580.91s]  Would you say the names of other weapons?
[11580.91s -> 11581.91s]  Knife.
[11581.91s -> 11583.22s]  Knife.
[11583.22s -> 11584.46s]  Knife.
[11584.46s -> 11585.46s]  Um...
[11585.46s -> 11587.21s]  You know that, um...
[11587.21s -> 11594.18s]  No, a stick won't do it.
[11594.18s -> 11596.18s]  A stick.
[11596.18s -> 11598.18s]  Yeah, hit it with a stick.
[11598.18s -> 11600.18s]  Hit the monster with a stick.
[11600.18s -> 11601.55s]  No, it won't do it.
[11601.55s -> 11602.55s]  Yes, it will.
[11602.55s -> 11604.69s]  A medicine.
[11604.69s -> 11606.12s]  Yes, that's it.
[11606.12s -> 11608.12s]  A weapon you can make using medicine.
[11608.12s -> 11612.98s]  No, hit it with a stick.
[11612.98s -> 11613.98s]  Uh...
[11613.98s -> 11616.06s]  Flame broiled.
[11616.06s -> 11618.06s]  We had to give up on flamethrowers already.
[11618.06s -> 11619.06s]  Um...
[11619.06s -> 11622.13s]  That weapon that burned...
[11622.13s -> 11623.13s]  A battle axe.
[11623.13s -> 11625.94s]  Was it an axe or something?
[11625.94s -> 11627.82s]  Um...
[11627.82s -> 11629.82s]  That burning weapon, what was it?
[11629.82s -> 11630.82s]  A burning axe.
[11630.82s -> 11633.06s]  That's enough about axes.
[11633.06s -> 11634.06s]  Um...
[11634.06s -> 11635.06s]  An ice enchanted axe.
[11635.06s -> 11637.06s]  That burning weapon, what was it?
[11637.06s -> 11639.75s]  A plus two lightning axe.
[11639.75s -> 11642.75s]  Operator, can you tell me the names of weapons that you know?
[11642.75s -> 11643.75s]  Lightning.
[11643.75s -> 11647.14s]  Lightning spell.
[11647.14s -> 11648.14s]  A taser.
[11648.14s -> 11649.14s]  Um...
[11649.14s -> 11651.83s]  A fiery weapon.
[11651.83s -> 11654.71s]  A fiery weapon.
[11654.71s -> 11655.71s]  Sword.
[11655.71s -> 11656.71s]  A sword.
[11656.71s -> 11657.71s]  Um...
[11657.71s -> 11661.08s]  That's right, a weapon that uses alcohol.
[11661.08s -> 11662.08s]  I didn't say anything.
[11662.08s -> 11665.08s]  It's gonna Luigi me in about five seconds.
[11665.08s -> 11667.83s]  An alcohol coated sword.
[11667.83s -> 11669.83s]  No, a stick won't do it.
[11669.83s -> 11670.83s]  Um...
[11670.83s -> 11671.83s]  An alcohol stick.
[11671.83s -> 11674.83s]  That's right, a weapon that uses alcohol.
[11674.83s -> 11679.34s]  Cannon.
[11679.34s -> 11681.58s]  A cannon.
[11681.58s -> 11682.94s]  Cannon.
[11682.94s -> 11685.25s]  A cannon.
[11685.25s -> 11687.25s]  That's enough about swords.
[11687.25s -> 11688.25s]  Um...
[11688.25s -> 11691.58s]  A weapon that uses alcohol.
[11691.58s -> 11692.58s]  A bomb.
[11692.58s -> 11693.58s]  Handguns and stuff.
[11693.58s -> 11694.58s]  Huh.
[11694.58s -> 11695.58s]  Um...
[11695.58s -> 11702.24s]  A weapon that burns with alcohol.
[11702.24s -> 11705.24s]  I know what it is, but I want to see how many things she knows.
[11705.24s -> 11709.27s]  Molotov cocktail.
[11709.27s -> 11710.27s]  Molotov.
[11710.27s -> 11715.35s]  Sword.
[11715.35s -> 11717.35s]  There should be alcohol in every medical room.
[11717.35s -> 11720.35s]  We'll find some alcohol and make a Molotov cocktail.
[11720.35s -> 11723.35s]  Okay, let's look for some alcohol.
[11723.35s -> 11729.35s]  Imagine how fucking stupid you would sound if I'm an operator sitting in a room by myself
[11729.35s -> 11732.35s]  and this girl is here alone.
[11732.35s -> 11735.35s]  There's all kinds of fucking creatures and monsters and weirdos.
[11735.35s -> 11738.35s]  And she's asking me for help on what they can make for a weapon
[11738.35s -> 11740.35s]  and I'm leaning in going, you should find a sword.
[11740.35s -> 11742.35s]  You should find a sword.
[11742.35s -> 11746.36s]  Like how much of a fucking idiot would you have to be?
[11746.36s -> 11752.57s]  Operating table.
[11752.57s -> 11753.57s]  The operating table.
[11753.57s -> 11754.57s]  Okay.
[11754.57s -> 11756.64s]  A stick.
[11756.64s -> 11758.64s]  Throw a stick at him.
[11758.64s -> 11764.91s]  Operating table.
[11764.91s -> 11768.26s]  Check.
[11768.26s -> 11770.02s]  Huh?
[11770.02s -> 11771.02s]  Sorry.
[11771.02s -> 11772.02s]  It's nothing.
[11772.02s -> 11773.02s]  It's nothing.
[11773.02s -> 11775.92s]  What?
[11775.92s -> 11776.92s]  What are you getting?
[11776.92s -> 11777.92s]  Strong memories.
[11777.92s -> 11778.92s]  Getting some backstory.
[11778.92s -> 11786.75s]  You know what I mean?
[11786.75s -> 11787.75s]  Check machine.
[11787.75s -> 11788.75s]  Oh, sorry.
[11788.75s -> 11790.75s]  Now is not the time to be talking about that.
[11790.75s -> 11791.75s]  How about the machine?
[11791.75s -> 11792.75s]  We're looking for weapons here.
[11792.75s -> 11794.75s]  There doesn't appear to be anything here.
[11794.75s -> 11795.75s]  Come on.
[11795.75s -> 11797.75s]  Let's check somewhere else.
[11797.75s -> 11801.98s]  You are really stupid.
[11801.98s -> 11802.98s]  Okay.
[11802.98s -> 11808.35s]  You are very dumb.
[11808.35s -> 11818.30s]  Yes.
[11818.30s -> 11823.62s]  You are extraordinarily untalented.
[11823.62s -> 11824.62s]  You are dumb.
[11824.62s -> 11825.62s]  Phew.
[11825.62s -> 11826.86s]  You are stupid.
[11826.86s -> 11827.86s]  All right.
[11827.86s -> 11828.86s]  What am I doing?
[11828.86s -> 11829.86s]  Check bed.
[11829.86s -> 11830.86s]  The bed.
[11830.86s -> 11831.86s]  Okay.
[11831.86s -> 11834.90s]  You are very cool.
[11834.90s -> 11835.90s]  Yes.
[11835.90s -> 11840.18s]  It's a bed for resting.
[11840.18s -> 11842.18s]  It doesn't appear to have been used at all.
[11842.18s -> 11845.02s]  That's it?
[11845.02s -> 11847.20s]  There's nothing here.
[11847.20s -> 11848.44s]  Let's look elsewhere.
[11848.44s -> 11851.02s]  There's nothing in the bed.
[11851.02s -> 11854.02s]  Nothing in the operating table.
[11854.02s -> 11855.02s]  Check desk.
[11855.02s -> 11856.02s]  The desk.
[11856.02s -> 11861.87s]  Okay.
[11861.87s -> 11863.87s]  We got some x-rays here.
[11863.87s -> 11864.87s]  Look at the x-rays.
[11864.87s -> 11868.01s]  It's from an employee checkup.
[11868.01s -> 11871.82s]  But to have someone look inside your body.
[11871.82s -> 11872.82s]  Not for me.
[11872.82s -> 11873.82s]  Thanks.
[11873.82s -> 11877.79s]  You're never going to get an x-ray?
[11877.79s -> 11883.74s]  That's really not that smart to say that.
[11883.74s -> 11886.74s]  I fell off my skateboard and I think I might have broke my arm.
[11886.74s -> 11889.74s]  We need to see where the brake is so we can determine if we need to do anything about it.
[11889.74s -> 11890.74s]  No.
[11890.74s -> 11891.74s]  I'm not doing x-rays.
[11891.74s -> 11892.74s]  I'm not doing it.
[11892.74s -> 11901.90s]  Check left drawer.
[11901.90s -> 11902.90s]  Drawer.
[11902.90s -> 11905.65s]  This one, right?
[11905.65s -> 11910.28s]  Oh, nice.
[11910.28s -> 11911.28s]  A collectible card.
[11911.28s -> 11914.35s]  It's a doctor's ID card.
[11914.35s -> 11916.68s]  It looks useful.
[11916.68s -> 11923.91s]  I'll take it.
[11923.91s -> 11926.28s]  We got...
[11926.28s -> 11929.46s]  Take a quick look at the computer monitor on the left.
[11929.46s -> 11930.46s]  The PC?
[11930.46s -> 11934.34s]  I don't know what you're saying.
[11934.34s -> 11935.34s]  The PC.
[11935.34s -> 11937.16s]  There's nothing wrong.
[11937.16s -> 11939.16s]  It's just not turned on.
[11939.16s -> 11945.60s]  Play Fortnite on PC.
[11945.60s -> 11946.60s]  The PC?
[11946.60s -> 11949.84s]  I don't know what you're saying.
[11949.84s -> 11950.84s]  Sorry.
[11950.84s -> 11951.84s]  I was doing it.
[11951.84s -> 11958.41s]  I was making a dumb joke for chat.
[11958.41s -> 11960.58s]  Go look at the books.
[11961.58s -> 11965.23s]  Open medical book.
[11971.40s -> 11972.40s]  It wasn't his own joke.
[11972.40s -> 11973.40s]  No, it wasn't.
[11976.52s -> 11977.52s]  I'm looking at it.
[11977.52s -> 11978.52s]  I'm seeing a lot of HAA.
[11978.52s -> 11979.52s]  Capital HAA.
[11983.70s -> 11984.70s]  I don't like it.
[11989.70s -> 11990.70s]  Nopers.
[11990.70s -> 11991.70s]  Ha ha.
[11993.70s -> 11994.70s]  Ha ha ha.
[11994.70s -> 11995.70s]  Nopers?
[11997.70s -> 12000.09s]  Right?
[12000.09s -> 12001.09s]  Right, guys?
[12001.09s -> 12002.65s]  Open fridge.
[12007.42s -> 12009.42s]  Refrigerated box on the right.
[12011.42s -> 12013.24s]  Glass case.
[12015.24s -> 12016.24s]  No.
[12016.24s -> 12018.44s]  What?
[12018.44s -> 12023.56s]  What the hell am I doing?
[12025.56s -> 12026.56s]  Shoot.
[12026.56s -> 12027.56s]  Here we go.
[12027.56s -> 12028.56s]  This is the perfect...
[12028.56s -> 12029.56s]  Shoot glass.
[12031.56s -> 12032.56s]  Shoot glass.
[12032.56s -> 12033.56s]  Glass.
[12034.56s -> 12035.56s]  Stop.
[12036.56s -> 12037.56s]  Stop.

[12049.74s -> 12052.84s]  Shoot case two.
[12056.77s -> 12057.77s]  Didn't work.
[12062.52s -> 12063.52s]  The normal way.
[12066.04s -> 12067.04s]  Look at panel.
[12067.04s -> 12068.04s]  Panel.
[12074.65s -> 12075.65s]  Yeah.
[12075.65s -> 12077.66s]  Card reader.
[12081.66s -> 12082.66s]  Do you have one?
[12082.66s -> 12085.09s]  Use card on card reader.
[12089.09s -> 12090.09s]  I'm not there.
[12091.09s -> 12094.67s]  ID card required for awkward opening and closing cases.
[12095.67s -> 12098.06s]  Use ID.
[12103.57s -> 12104.57s]  Use ID.
[12106.57s -> 12107.57s]  No.

[12158.06s -> 12159.06s]  Back.
[12159.06s -> 12160.94s]  Back.
[12163.39s -> 12164.39s]  Can I get a better angle than this?
[12164.39s -> 12166.39s]  I'm trying to do like a cinematic machinima here.
[12166.39s -> 12167.39s]  Back.
[12168.39s -> 12170.34s]  Target two.

[12192.26s -> 12193.26s]  Target enemy one.
[12193.26s -> 12195.26s]  What in the name of God would you say?

[12244.99s -> 12254.78s]  Gonna open them all now.
[12254.78s -> 12257.22s]  Use ID card.
[12257.22s -> 12258.22s]  Okay.
[12260.97s -> 12262.97s]  What is it?
[12262.97s -> 12263.97s]  Case three.
[12263.97s -> 12264.97s]  Case three.
[12264.97s -> 12265.97s]  Okay.
[12265.97s -> 12269.90s]  Okay.
[12269.90s -> 12270.90s]  I'll use the ID card.
[12270.90s -> 12271.90s]  Yes you will.
[12271.90s -> 12277.68s]  Okay.
[12277.68s -> 12279.68s]  Now you can disengage the locks.
[12279.68s -> 12283.86s]  Can I?
[12283.86s -> 12288.24s]  Open it up.
[12288.24s -> 12294.62s]  The shelf appears to be for ointments and lotions.
[12294.62s -> 12296.62s]  This is just a liquor store cabinet.
[12296.62s -> 12299.98s]  This is the beer and wine section of the grocery store.
[12299.98s -> 12303.54s]  Grab a fucking 12 pack of cider while we're at it.
[12303.54s -> 12305.30s]  This?
[12305.30s -> 12306.66s]  Here it is.
[12306.66s -> 12308.48s]  Alcohol.
[12308.48s -> 12309.48s]  Oh it is alcohol.
[12309.48s -> 12311.48s]  We can use this to make a molotov cocktail.
[12311.48s -> 12316.50s]  That's right.
[12316.50s -> 12317.50s]  Let me see.
[12317.50s -> 12325.70s]  Alan said that the spider is vulnerable to fire.
[12325.70s -> 12327.70s]  But he was using a flamethrower.
[12327.70s -> 12332.14s]  I wonder if a molotov cocktail would really do the job.
[12332.14s -> 12334.14s]  It is fire so yes.
[12334.14s -> 12335.14s]  But there's no choice.
[12335.14s -> 12337.14s]  This will have to do.
[12337.14s -> 12340.14s]  Hey, operator.
[12340.14s -> 12345.32s]  I'm finding it a little hard to believe those monsters are actually aliens.
[12345.32s -> 12347.32s]  I mean imagine it.
[12347.32s -> 12349.32s]  Aliens attacking people.
[12349.32s -> 12351.32s]  What do you think they are?
[12351.32s -> 12352.32s]  This isn't a movie.
[12352.32s -> 12355.32s]  Do you think they're like parrots?
[12355.32s -> 12356.32s]  No, it's okay.
[12356.32s -> 12357.32s]  Dogs?
[12357.32s -> 12358.32s]  Cats?
[12358.32s -> 12359.32s]  It's fine.
[12359.32s -> 12363.56s]  Anyways, we have to do something about the spider first.
[12363.56s -> 12365.56s]  It's not a spider.
[12365.56s -> 12369.56s]  It's clearly a huge fucking alien with the green eyes.

[19150.04s -> 19152.04s]  Perhaps they haven't arrived yet, sir

[19233.06s -> 19255.69s]  They all aimed down to start firing at the same time. Do I get rescued to
[19256.49s -> 19259.49s]  Barricade the perimeter so nothing can break in. Yes, sir

[19272.72s -> 19274.72s]  The shuttle terminal has been destroyed
[19275.56s -> 19277.56s]  So we had to break through the ceiling
[19278.16s -> 19280.16s]  That delayed our arrival. Oh
[19282.20s -> 19286.04s]  We received a transmission from mr. Powers describing what has taken place
[19286.52s -> 19289.60s]  We'll be setting up our base of operations here in the receiving court
[19289.88s -> 19292.96s]  We will take all survivors into protective custody here
[19293.56s -> 19298.04s]  Barricades will be erected to keep the aliens out do not leave the area for any reason
[19298.24s -> 19300.52s]  Is that understood understood?

[19324.30s -> 19327.38s]  She was so against changing clothes two hours ago
[19328.10s -> 19330.94s]  All of a sudden she wants to wear the earthworm Jim costume
[19331.62s -> 19342.32s]  I mean, I'll be to be honest though. If there was an earthworm Jim
[19343.20s -> 19359.99s]  Costume available. I would put it on too. All right, so no, we're still going operator. What's next listen to this
[19360.95s -> 19362.95s]  Naomi is definitely not here

[19845.98s -> 19850.33s]  This was an hour ago. That's the last time I was allowed to save the game
[19850.97s -> 19855.61s]  Well, if I didn't miss
[19856.79s -> 19864.77s]  400 rounds point blank out of like 420 up. Yes

[19920.42s -> 19938.80s]  I don't think there was even a save point in the middle
[19938.80s -> 19941.50s]  It was like the the hallway stuff the bunch of cutscenes
[19942.14s -> 19946.70s]  Cutscene again military comes in and then that was there even I don't think it was even a save point
[19947.46s -> 19949.46s]  Maybe in that room that I walked into
[19952.49s -> 19954.49s]  We finally made it to here
[19955.05s -> 19957.35s]  The receiving port is just ahead
[19959.66s -> 19971.22s]  Yeah, cuz I can't leave this happens and then when I come out I can't go anywhere right check
[19971.78s -> 19985.73s]  Is there anyone here?
[19985.81s -> 19994.18s]  This is terrible, I'll check in the back if you see anything tell me don't screw up
[20004.78s -> 20012.02s]  There doesn't appear to be anyone. I must have been imagining things. Sorry. Guess I didn't need you that time. Look out
[20037.23s -> 20039.55s]  I
[20039.55s -> 20045.79s]  Damn it. No, there's so much in between this shit. Apparently some of the aliens are humanoid
[20049.98s -> 20057.72s]  I'm gonna try this one more time. Sorry to hear that. We're so we're very they're so close to me. What is the situation in the hotel?
[20058.32s -> 20059.92s]  No, anything
[20059.92s -> 20062.74s]  I'm not sure what's happening either
[20062.74s -> 20067.34s]  But I've been told that a rescue team will be arriving in the receiving port. We have to be getting close
[20068.54s -> 20070.38s]  rescue team a
[20070.38s -> 20075.62s]  Rescue team. Oh, dear. That's wonderful. Oh, it's good news. Yes
[20079.58s -> 20081.90s]  But sir, which unit could it be
[20083.14s -> 20085.22s]  Let's see how far this one special forces
[20086.58s -> 20089.38s]  If so, that makes this a military incident
[20089.46s -> 20094.62s]  There was talk that the police department had a task force capable of this type of rescue and extraction
[20094.62s -> 20099.06s]  if that's the case and it is the police we should be able to cover up some of the legal issues that
[20099.62s -> 20104.36s]  Stem from this incident still it's a problem. I wasn't involved. Oh, yes
[20107.62s -> 20109.62s]  It's got some politics
[20111.10s -> 20112.54s]  By the way
[20112.54s -> 20117.58s]  There's a big problem. The receiving port shutter is locked in and it won't open
[20118.66s -> 20125.10s]  What's that? It shouldn't be a problem. I have an operator backing me up. He'll open it for us
[20126.18s -> 20128.49s]  You can do it, right?
[20128.57s -> 20133.22s]  Yes, I knew you could do it. Yes, I can go. He says he can hurry. Oh
[20136.15s -> 20137.91s]  Good news
[20137.91s -> 20143.33s]  Good. He's still here. We aren't the only ones in need of rescuing
[20143.89s -> 20148.15s]  Get word to the team leader that I won't board the shuttle
[20148.71s -> 20150.62s]  Yes, sir
[20150.62s -> 20153.06s]  Understood fine. Let's be on our way. I
[20153.98s -> 20161.46s]  Never expected to be attacked by Prime Minister Takayama's bodyguard
[20162.30s -> 20164.70s]  We both better be prepared for more surprises
[20165.70s -> 20179.54s]  Okay for a luck got baited into dropping 800
[20180.70s -> 20189.79s]  See remember that the door closes behind me
[20190.51s -> 20192.51s]  And I can't go in here
[20192.51s -> 20198.34s]  Why would you the door panel appears to have been broken is the only safe point back here?
[20198.34s -> 20202.22s]  I can't get into the moon. Why wouldn't you let somebody save the game after like a long-ass cutscene like that?
[20202.86s -> 20210.28s]  The Prime Minister's part I go through the shuttle port. We need to hurry like tonight shutters six shutters six
[20210.28s -> 20212.97s]  Can I go through it?
[20213.01s -> 20214.77s]  Run. Yes
[20214.85s -> 20220.66s]  What should I do now?
[20220.66s -> 20224.37s]  guest room five
[20224.41s -> 20226.41s]  guest room five so far away
[20227.69s -> 20244.94s]  Run yes, and do the door lock, please
[20250.33s -> 20272.25s]  Thanks my chat experience. What is this? What's what what's wrong? What's happening?
[20273.11s -> 20276.82s]  Save point the save point. Okay
[20277.54s -> 20290.66s]  Wait people don't know we're talking politics. No, nobody's always talking politics. Are we we got a rule? No politics?
[20291.30s -> 20318.30s]  Yeah, okay. I got it already
[20321.66s -> 20323.51s]  Okay
[20323.51s -> 20327.59s]  Hallway, so now we got now. We have to watch another cutscene
[20328.23s -> 20333.48s]  If I lose it again
[20333.48s -> 20335.48s]  we might transition to

[20658.66s -> 20662.66s]  I'm not gonna lose. We're gonna do it right now. Everyone, the guy dies.
[20671.72s -> 20683.75s]  It's up to you. Hallway. It's a little too quiet.

[20718.38s -> 20736.51s]  I'm just here enjoying the stream. That's good.
[20736.51s -> 20743.91s]  Dear? Hey, there's no one here. Where is the rescue team?
[20743.91s -> 20749.15s]  Perhaps they haven't arrived yet, sir. This isn't a good place to be.
[20749.15s -> 20752.15s]  If we were attacked by aliens in the open...
[20758.51s -> 20760.51s]  That's no good. Turn around.
[20762.51s -> 20766.16s]  We're surrounded.
[20767.16s -> 20769.16s]  Who told you about the rescue team?
[20769.16s -> 20771.16s]  It was the supervisor, Mr. Powers.
[20771.16s -> 20773.16s]  I knew something was wrong.
[20773.16s -> 20779.16s]  Oh, what? I pressed select.
[20779.16s -> 20781.16s]  Before.
[20781.16s -> 20785.83s]  Listen to this. Naomi is definitely not here. She must be waiting for help somewhere.
[20785.83s -> 20787.83s]  I pressed every button like three times.
[20787.83s -> 20790.83s]  Look, the rescue team will be here soon enough.
[20790.83s -> 20793.83s]  In the meantime, let's go find Helen Johnson, the reporter.
[20793.83s -> 20796.83s]  I can't do this without your help.
[20796.83s -> 20809.37s]  Will you just trust me? Just a little while longer?
[20809.37s -> 20813.30s]  Come on. Come on, just do it.
[20813.30s -> 20817.48s]  No. Yes.
[20817.48s -> 20820.55s]  Thanks. I've been interested in you two.
[20820.55s -> 20822.55s]  I wanna sneeze into the microphone so bad, but I haven't been able to do it ever.
[20822.55s -> 20826.55s]  I get sneeze shy when it happens. It's really irritating.
[20826.55s -> 20835.13s]  I know this will work, and I managed to get one of these.
[20835.13s -> 20837.13s]  Yeah, you're a terrible shot.
[20837.13s -> 20841.94s]  The P.M.'s group should be safe now, especially with weapons like these to protect them.
[20841.94s -> 20847.55s]  Okay, let's get out of here.
[20847.55s -> 20855.70s]  I can't believe select does it, and I really thought I pressed it a dozen times.
[20855.70s -> 20873.38s]  Phew. Got away safely, thanks to that wireless system.
[20873.38s -> 20879.80s]  There's supposed to be a monster that even the rescue team couldn't handle.
[20879.80s -> 20883.68s]  We have to find Helen and Naomi as soon as we can.
[20883.68s -> 20884.68s]  Can I go back and receiving port?
[20884.68s -> 20892.26s]  It's not safe. If we were to check every room one by one, we'd surely find them.
[20892.26s -> 20898.87s]  Past here is the staff area. Where shall we check first?
[20898.87s -> 20902.24s]  Receiving port, right?
[20902.24s -> 20906.66s]  Receiving port.
[20906.66s -> 20908.66s]  The receiving port, okay?
[20908.66s -> 20910.66s]  Just go back in, see if there's a kiosk.
[20910.66s -> 20912.66s]  Aren't we going to look for Naomi?
[20912.66s -> 20913.66s]  No, okay, so then...
[20913.66s -> 20915.66s]  Let's move on.
[20915.66s -> 20917.66s]  Surface staff quarters.
[20917.66s -> 20918.66s]  The service staff quarters.
[20918.66s -> 20919.66s]  Run.
[20919.66s -> 20920.66s]  Yes.
[20920.66s -> 20942.84s]  Listen, do you hear shooting?
[20942.84s -> 20947.15s]  Shooting?
[20947.15s -> 20960.76s]  I think it's from the warehouse. We should check it out. It's a dead end this way.
[20960.76s -> 20968.05s]  Why is that showing up on stream right now? That's from an hour and a half ago.
[20968.05s -> 20974.77s]  If something happens, I need you to tell me what to do.
[20974.77s -> 20977.77s]  That is so big.
[20977.77s -> 20979.77s]  That's a cosplay gun.
[20979.77s -> 20993.14s]  A major wobble was detected in the fake station's rotation.
[20993.14s -> 21000.76s]  The station was placed on emergency status, although the wobble will not interfere with its orbit.
[21000.76s -> 21008.21s]  Phew. It sounds like a war zone.
[21008.21s -> 21010.21s]  I think there was a warehouse key in my room.
[21010.21s -> 21011.21s]  One person shooting.
[21011.21s -> 21019.35s]  Let's go get it. It's in the service staff quarters.
[21019.35s -> 21021.35s]  So I have to go in there.
[21021.35s -> 21023.53s]  Service staff quarters.
[21023.53s -> 21025.53s]  The service staff quarters. Okay.
[21025.53s -> 21026.53s]  Run.
[21026.53s -> 21027.53s]  Yes.
[21027.53s -> 21038.50s]  Really?
[21038.50s -> 21039.50s]  Back.
[21039.50s -> 21040.50s]  Back.
[21040.50s -> 21042.38s]  Right eye.

[21047.38s -> 21048.38s]  Middle eye.
[21048.38s -> 21049.38s]  My body.
[21049.38s -> 21050.81s]  Red eye.
[21050.81s -> 21051.81s]  Did you see that?
[21051.81s -> 21053.81s]  Okay, let's go.
[21053.81s -> 21060.36s]  Service staff quarters.
[21060.36s -> 21061.36s]  The service staff quarters.
[21061.36s -> 21062.36s]  Run.
[21062.36s -> 21063.36s]  Okay.
[21063.36s -> 21064.36s]  Run.
[21064.36s -> 21080.19s]  Yes.
[21080.19s -> 21082.14s]  What is this?
[21082.14s -> 21083.14s]  Big monster?
[21084.14s -> 21085.14s]  This is bad.
[21085.14s -> 21089.60s]  What about my room?
[21089.60s -> 21090.60s]  My room?
[21090.60s -> 21093.48s]  What do you mean my room?
[21093.48s -> 21099.30s]  Oh, this is fantastic.
[21099.30s -> 21102.30s]  I just ran into like the last boss.
[21102.30s -> 21103.30s]  Back.
[21103.30s -> 21104.30s]  Back.

[37223.86s -> 37233.68s]  soft edge corporation paracelsus plan that didn't say plans his project are you familiar
[37233.68s -> 37239.60s]  with the philosopher stone it is said to have been in the possession of paracelsus
[37239.68s -> 37246.24s]  a 16th century european philosopher capable of generating intense healing power
[37246.24s -> 37252.72s]  it was a stone that defied human comprehension it was studied by some scholars of the time
[37253.44s -> 37260.48s]  but despite lengthy research their efforts were in vain at long last however we have
[37260.56s -> 37270.00s]  succeeded in reproducing the philosopher stone this is it this is it the philosopher stone we
[37270.00s -> 37276.56s]  have created is identical in composition and structure to the original and its potency is
[37276.56s -> 37284.00s]  even greater so what are you gonna do this photo presents a simulation of the effects of the
[37284.00s -> 37291.04s]  original philosopher stone as noted in ancient manuscripts the next photo shows the results of
[37291.04s -> 37295.36s]  an experiment based on the instructions in those ancient documents it's obviously not
[37295.36s -> 37302.00s]  working because it's turning people into fucking mad as you can see our philosopher stone is
[37302.00s -> 37308.56s]  capable of producing effects precisely opposite to those produced by the original slugs instead
[37308.56s -> 37314.64s]  of healing a living thing so that it may survive it curses the organism which remains
[37314.64s -> 37322.24s]  alive a number of possible results of the use of this stone can be imagined but the most effective
[37322.24s -> 37328.72s]  is the use of an accursed hex capable of plunging a civilized society into chaos
[37329.76s -> 37336.48s]  this very stone has been spared in order that your country may carry out its plan of battle
[37336.48s -> 37339.60s]  and we believe that this is the only measure available

[40565.29s -> 40588.40s]  no another grenade no another grenade why did I stop because people were telling me that
[40589.90s -> 40596.48s]  they could shoot I've the real question you should be asking yourself is why did it take
[40597.28s -> 40607.44s]  like 17 times saying shoot red shoot red lever red lever shoot red shoot red why did it take
[40607.44s -> 40631.84s]  that many times that's the question you should be asking I can't fucking believe it and the
[40631.84s -> 40638.72s]  reason why is because somebody said the one guy and I listened it was when I when you go
[40638.72s -> 40652.32s]  out of cover you could just get shot by one of these guys if there is that true so wait
[40652.32s -> 40661.85s]  so it is true so I would have just died anyways if I did shoot yellow yellow lever I can't believe
[40661.85s -> 40682.89s]  I have to do that whole thing again what were they thinking what the hell are you thinking
[40687.48s -> 40694.06s]  you put an unskippable like seven minutes of cutscene and a bomb diffusion thing with

[42475.64s -> 42482.03s]  when I'm being pulled both ways if left soldier right soldier it just ruined the
[42482.03s -> 42489.48s]  ruin of the I can't call me a quitter this game I can't I can't not right now
[42490.12s -> 42510.92s]  I will see you guys tomorrow today of whatever the fuck it is stream's probably
[42510.92s -> 42524.36s]  not gonna start until 4 p.m pacific because this is going very late watch the no I might
[42524.36s -> 42530.80s]  finish this tomorrow I think I'm actually gonna jump back into this and finish it tomorrow
[42531.36s -> 42550.08s]  so 4 p.m pacific when the stream is gonna start Merry Christmas or whatever today today
[42550.08s -> 42558.88s]  like today because another stream is gonna happen today it is also because I only have
[42559.52s -> 42567.64s]  no health I actually think the game is fun fairly fun and funny and interesting so I mean
[42571.53s -> 42578.89s]  but for the sake of how late this is and how I have to get up and stream again
[42579.77s -> 42589.55s]  we're probably going to let's see here let me see how many bits there are because there are
[42589.55s -> 42594.92s]  a lot of subs too I want to show the credits at least let's go through some of these
[42594.92s -> 42616.94s]  because I think no never mind that's not gonna work yeah I think I have to just save the bit
[42616.94s -> 42626.84s]  reading for tomorrow because this is this is a lot of people give a ton of money today like an
[42626.84s -> 42630.60s]  absolute monumental amount of fucking money and this this stream will go on for like
[42630.60s -> 42643.96s]  another two and a half hours which would then be about five plus a.m pacific so I'm gonna
[42643.96s -> 42649.48s]  run the credits the we have that website that tracks everything so I'm gonna go over
[42650.04s -> 42655.63s]  the bits from today tomorrow so tomorrow you're gonna be reading bits before I was
[42656.35s -> 42667.24s]  no I'm gonna probably go through them as quickly as I can but holy shit guys
[42668.41s -> 42674.65s]  there was seriously like there was like probably almost three grand today if you're
[42674.73s -> 42682.91s]  including subscriptions bits there were hundreds of gifted subs thousands of dollars
[42682.91s -> 42688.60s]  and bits it was it was insane and I'm really sorry that I just I really don't have it
[42688.60s -> 42697.23s]  in me mentally for energy right now to go through and do them all just know that I can't
[42697.23s -> 42706.73s]  thank you enough thousands of fucking dollars in one day so I'm gonna get some sleep I'll
[42706.73s -> 42714.56s]  see you guys at four p.m pacific for the stream and maybe afterwards I will give this another go
[42715.44s -> 42719.52s]  we'll see on top of that thanks everybody there was a lot of there's a couple of raids
[42719.52s -> 42723.45s]  and hosts and everything and there were a lot of people that came out thank you for coming
[42723.45s -> 42728.57s]  out if you stuck around hell yeah thanks for sticking around let's run the credits because
[42728.57s -> 42736.17s]  it's gonna be crazy and then we can get some sleep is it even running holy shit
[42740.44s -> 42749.60s]  that might be the fastest it's ever gone I've never seen it scroll that fast
[42750.16s -> 42774.33s]  holy shit have fun reading that yeah good night guys see you in uh like 12 and a half hours
[42774.33s -> 42790.72s]  whatever it is you stayed so I you stayed so I could read your bits at the end I am sad
[42791.36s -> 42797.02s]  I'm really sorry but I am out of gas completely I never expected I was gonna
[42797.02s -> 42802.46s]  play this for more than like eight to seven to eight plus hours but I gotta be honest with
[42802.46s -> 42809.29s]  you guys I'm out of gas completely and I would not I would rather hold on to them and do them
[42809.29s -> 42816.17s]  when I have energy than like sleepy almost almost potentially lazily going through them
[42817.36s -> 42830.16s]  you know I'm saying did you see cry yeah actually I did uh Kraken was in town
[42831.53s -> 42834.89s]  he's really really great he hit me up he said hey I'm gonna be in Vegas and I was
[42834.89s -> 42847.68s]  like I'll come say hello hung up for a little while it was great I came back from a pee break
[42847.68s -> 42852.88s]  did I miss anything uh well you missed left soldier right soldier is what you missed
[42866.59s -> 42875.58s]  I had coached him on gambling well I pressed a button and I won money there's not much
[42875.58s -> 42894.81s]  not much coaching this has got to be 500 fucking subs let me see yeah it's this is
[42894.81s -> 42900.40s]  close to 500 subs in one day I think that's only ever happened to maybe one or two more
[42900.40s -> 42908.14s]  other times how much money have I made isn't it how much money have I made this month how
[42908.14s -> 42914.62s]  much money did I make this stream this straights gotta be at least two to three grand has to be
