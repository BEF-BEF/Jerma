[0.31s -> 24.81s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Sniper with the Sniper Rifle and the Darwin's Danger Shield and the Ham.
[24.81s -> 33.81s]  I don't know why I never take the Ham off, by the way. I think the Ham is just one of those melee items that you're never scared to use, cause I play Huntsman a lot, you guys know that.
[33.81s -> 38.81s]  So when I play Huntsman and I go up against a Pyro and I have the Bushwhacker or something like that, I just get melted.
[38.81s -> 46.05s]  So I've decided to keep the Ham on pretty much permanently, at least on the Sniper. And this video is gonna talk about some things.
[46.05s -> 52.47s]  First of all, Google. What the fuck, man? That's pretty much it. That's pretty much all that needs to be said.
[52.47s -> 59.65s]  My video from the other day was deleted from like 20% of everybody's feeds, and if it happened to you, then I'm really sorry.
[59.65s -> 63.65s]  I wish there was something I could do about it, but there is no magic button I can press.
[63.65s -> 68.65s]  I can't magically have it go back in everybody's feeds, and that's unfortunate, but that's pretty much all that needs to be said.
[68.65s -> 73.65s]  If you think you're missing videos of mine, just check my channel page or check my descriptions of my videos.
[73.65s -> 77.65s]  I usually put the last two uploads there, so that's where you can find them.
[77.65s -> 81.21s]  We're gonna move on from that, though. Just gonna let the gameplay sit in the background.
[81.21s -> 89.21s]  We're gonna talk about something that was on my mind today, and I'm gonna get what you guys have to say about it, cause it's kind of different, kind of a weird thing to talk about,
[89.21s -> 94.45s]  but I'm gonna talk about it anyways, and it's dreams. Dreams. Specifically bad dreams.
[94.45s -> 99.62s]  Well, not even bad dreams, but we're gonna talk about literal dreams.
[99.62s -> 105.62s]  If you don't know what a literal dream is, it's when you are asleep, you are nice, comfortable in your bed,
[105.62s -> 111.62s]  and the dream you are having is something that potentially could be happening in real life.
[111.62s -> 118.62s]  It is not a supernatural thing. It's not like, oh my god, aliens landed in a spaceship and they're spiders and they ripped my penis off!
[118.62s -> 122.06s]  No, not like that. And I've been having a lot of these lately.
[122.06s -> 130.06s]  I've been having a lot of these self-aware, literal-ass dreams for a while now, and it reminds me of one in particular that I had a long time ago.
[130.06s -> 134.06s]  This didn't happen last night. I didn't just have this this last week or something.
[134.06s -> 143.06s]  This happened a long time ago, but it's something I remember, and I figured I would talk about it, cause it makes sense to bring up in a video about self-aware, literal dreams.
[143.06s -> 148.30s]  I was lying in bed, and this was a dream. Like, I'm lying in bed in the dream, right?
[148.30s -> 154.30s]  My bed is right here. I can see my window. The door is right there. Oh, I'm lying down in bed. This is a good, comfy bed.
[154.30s -> 162.66s]  And I remembered to myself, in the dream, hey, you know, it's really cool. I've got that suitcase full of money under my bed.
[162.66s -> 169.66s]  No, that's awesome. I'm so glad I have that. And I went under the bed, I pulled it up, put it on the bed, opened it up, like, started counting.
[169.66s -> 177.66s]  Oh, it is 100, 200, a stack of hundreds, fucking thousand dollars. Like, there was probably 50 grand in this suitcase.
[177.66s -> 185.66s]  Nothing crazy happened. Well, besides the fact that I'm counting 50 grand on my bed, it was as if it could have happened in real life.
[185.66s -> 191.66s]  So I closed the lid, put it back under the bed where it was nice and safe, and I went, it gets fuzzy after that.
[191.66s -> 200.14s]  But I remember waking up, and when you wake up from a dream like that, that feels really real, you think it's real.
[200.14s -> 206.14s]  At least for the first one minute of being awake, you think that what just happened was real.
[206.14s -> 214.14s]  And I did. I got out of bed, kind of groggy. Oh, where's that money? I've got to look at it, make sure it's still there.
[214.14s -> 219.14s]  I opened up underneath the bed. It's not there. And the first thing I could think to myself was, where is it?
[219.14s -> 224.14s]  Why is there no money under here? What did I do? Did I move it somewhere else? And then I went, what the fuck? This is a dream.
[224.14s -> 231.45s]  This was just a dream, dude. Who keeps money under their bed? Who has a stack of hundreds sitting in a suitcase? I have a bank account.
[231.45s -> 238.45s]  Why would I do this? Am I waiting for, like, the zombie apocalypse? But money would be worthless anyways at that point, so why do I have this here for?
[238.45s -> 247.12s]  And I got depressed. And it pretty much ruined the rest of my day, because I kept thinking back, man, that would be real nice if that actually was there.
[247.12s -> 251.12s]  And I know there's people that will tell me, well, Zerma, there's a reason why you had that dream.
[251.12s -> 259.12s]  You think that financially you might need to secure your money, or the psychiatric, psychic lady said your loved one might be trying to tell you.
[259.12s -> 263.55s]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't really look that much into the dreams that I have.
[263.55s -> 269.55s]  Specifically because I have so many batshit crazy dreams that it would be a hassle for me to look them up.
[269.55s -> 277.55s]  Like, I've had dreams before where I went to a gas station and a guy was chasing me with a chainsaw, and then I got like a syringe in my butt cheek,
[277.55s -> 283.55s]  and I woke up in a fucking fun land where people had to fight each other for a competition that was on TV.
[283.55s -> 290.11s]  Who can explain that? I have no idea what that means, so I don't usually look into them. I just think they're insane.
[290.11s -> 298.11s]  And honestly, I would much rather have one of those crazy dreams where nonsensical supernatural things happen
[298.11s -> 307.11s]  than a literal dream where something potentially really good happens and you're just left depressed when you actually wake up and come to and realize it wasn't even real.
[307.11s -> 311.61s]  And to close out this whole thing, to close out the whole literal dream thing,
[311.61s -> 317.85s]  how many of you guys have ever had a dream where you were like peeing or something and you woke up and you pissed your pants?
[317.85s -> 324.85s]  I tell you, I'm raising my hand right now. My hand is in the air raised. I have had a dream where I was pissing and I peed my pants when I woke up.
[324.85s -> 330.85s]  I've never shit the bed, though. Like, that's one thing. Like, bad dreams have never given me diarrhea.
[330.85s -> 340.02s]  They give me metaphorical diarrhea, though. When I get up and sometimes I feel like crap, I feel like a metaphorical diarrhea sometimes when I wake up.
[340.02s -> 345.02s]  But I've never done it actually in the bed. But yeah, I was like 14 at the time when I peed my pants.
[345.02s -> 350.81s]  You know everybody pees their pants, right? How many people have peed their pants before?
[350.81s -> 357.81s]  I don't think there's ever been anyone that's ever lived that after the age of four or five years old, they've never peed their pants.
[357.81s -> 362.81s]  And if you're going to tell me, Jerma, I've never peed my pants before, there's no way. I've never done it.
[362.81s -> 368.54s]  I just don't fucking believe you. I just don't. Maybe you haven't, but I just don't believe you.
[368.54s -> 372.54s]  Anyways, that's going to wrap up this really weird way to end this video.
[372.54s -> 376.54s]  I apologize for how strange this video got, but regardless, that's going to wrap it up here, guys.
[376.54s -> 381.54s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And that's going to be the end.
[381.54s -> 390.03s]  So, dreams. Do they give you diarrhea? Yes or no? No. Yes. Yes.
