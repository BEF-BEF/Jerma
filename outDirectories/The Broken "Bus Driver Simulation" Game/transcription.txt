[59.69s -> 71.88s]  have to do this every time? I have no what? That was just so complicated. I have to enter a service
[71.88s -> 80.26s]  number. Let's just go like 916. I think that was one. I'm pretty sure that was a service number.
[80.26s -> 89.37s]  I don't I don't know. No clear. Service number. Eight digit service number? What is with this?

[252.41s -> 260.34s]  identical guy driving the bus. Hey hey other me. Let me ask you a question. Remember the
[260.34s -> 268.79s]  space-time continuum training we had and. What? What? So what happens if I get in a head-on
[268.79s -> 288.34s]  collision? Oh that was so awful. That was the glitchiest piece of crap thing I've ever seen.
[288.34s -> 295.69s]  That was like tactical intervention right there. Bringing back horrible memories. Oh hey look let's
[295.69s -> 305.14s]  get in a crash. Oh yeah. Hey I like to drive buses. Have you played my video game where you drive
[305.14s -> 317.11s]  buses around? It's fun. It's called Bus Simulator 2013. Where are his hands? This guy's hands aren't
