[1.91s -> 7.48s]  This game is called Path to Die. It has two Steam reviews. It came out last week.
[7.48s -> 16.79s]  I might be running into a another um no no no no once like once every three or four months
[16.79s -> 23.29s]  there's like a bad stream oh hope not the stream goblin shows up and he's like
[25.21s -> 30.17s]  yes today is the day that i'm going to make the stream suck and he like grabs me but i'm
[30.17s -> 42.49s]  from like the back and pulls me back rips my neck forward oh i see you wanted to play
[43.13s -> 45.85s]  oh space channel five you loved the second one
[49.77s -> 54.57s]  and he fucking throws his hands out and casts like a bunch of magic spells at me
[55.21s -> 67.00s]  or sneeze whatever you want all right let's try this one it's called path to die it looks
[67.00s -> 73.08s]  like a top-down hotline miami-esque samurai game you control with the right stick i don't
[73.08s -> 77.80s]  know it might be great it might be a little hidden gem it might not even be worth playing
[77.80s -> 81.16s]  but we're going to try welcome to the stream everybody thanks for joining me
[94.39s -> 101.88s]  we may have found a great game i'm okay with that it looks pretty good let me just change
[101.88s -> 113.93s]  this delay on that anymore with this thank you for your patience guys i don't plan on shit
[113.93s -> 124.90s]  like this happening but sometimes it does here we go let's make sure the options oh this
[124.90s -> 130.84s]  is not plugged in better with i got a gamepad plugged in i was i came prepared for this one
[136.33s -> 155.05s]  so let's see turn it up a little effects graph graphics oh no ambience this looks familiar
[155.05s -> 169.86s]  it came out last week so maybe it looks a little familiar i am interested i'm just gonna
[169.86s -> 186.63s]  make sure this is loud enough for me okay that's better new game here we go so this is this
[186.63s -> 205.88s]  is a game where it's a well let's just experience it together brother the clan is
[205.88s -> 210.55s]  under attack they are killing everybody bring your family to the backyard hurry i will keep it
[210.55s -> 221.48s]  clear brother they killed her i couldn't save her now i'm dying too you must save my daughter
[221.48s -> 231.19s]  at least please dad no this takes place and um i don't know monsters you want to kill my
[231.19s -> 243.06s]  uncle go away but sir no exceptions no she would probably be running if i keep following
[243.06s -> 248.34s]  this path i will die fighting against the clan nagano by myself is something only a madman
[248.34s -> 253.75s]  would do i could run away live my life and die in bed as an old man but if we're going to die
[253.75s -> 257.03s]  either way i prefer to die with the blood in my hands i'll make them pay for what they did
[257.75s -> 268.02s]  good morning sir currently the entrance tax is 50 mon are you alone the others went to grab
[268.02s -> 273.66s]  something to eat you're really unlucky then with this heat and the blazing sun i think i'm
[273.66s -> 278.10s]  lucky waiting for them here in the shade i say you are unlucky because now you have to
[278.10s -> 286.07s]  fight me alone young man what why who are you my name is katsu akabashi akabashi you're from that
[286.07s -> 291.03s]  clan but they said they were no survivors your clan is going to pay for that mistake prepare
[291.03s -> 296.38s]  yourself use the left stick to move around you can hold right trigger to run but this
[296.38s -> 301.59s]  will consume stamina if you tap your character will dodge to the selected direction avoiding
[301.59s -> 309.19s]  damage except enemy arrows press a to interact with the environment this will allow you to open
[309.27s -> 317.83s]  doors or pick up objects the hud shows you the amount of health bleed is the amber part stamina
[317.83s -> 328.25s]  is the white ring katana sharpness is the white blade and arrows you have all right so red
[328.25s -> 334.74s]  circle is just health amber is the bleed stamina is the white ring and then katana
[334.74s -> 339.77s]  sharpness is the blade bleed limits the maximum amount of health you can have and
[339.77s -> 348.50s]  increases in a small proportion with damage received okay so that's just max health for
[348.50s -> 353.06s]  bleed katana sharpness affects how much damage your attacks inflict being halved with no
[353.06s -> 358.39s]  sharpness okay so that one i'm going to keep that up by pressing right bumper you can lock
[358.39s -> 363.19s]  on to enemies in combat you can change the target by pressing left stick the katana is
[363.19s -> 368.79s]  your main weapon is used with the right stick by pressing it you will unsheath or sheath your
[368.79s -> 373.03s]  katana with the sword sheath you can draw an attack at the same time only for left and
[373.03s -> 381.64s]  right attacks okay i have to try this with a semi-circle from left to right you'll make a
[381.64s -> 389.51s]  horizontal attack in that direction so you go like bang bang with with one from right to left
[389.51s -> 394.94s]  you the same opposite direction so bang bang with a forward movement you'll make thrust which
[394.94s -> 400.20s]  cannot be stopped by guarding but it is inflicted too much damage moving the stick back and forth
[400.20s -> 405.34s]  make a vertical cut that will break the enemy guard or inflict great damage the vertical cut
[405.34s -> 410.63s]  can be charged when you see a flash until you see a flash upon release it will inflict
[410.63s -> 416.74s]  double damage you can also pivot with left stick the 360 degree slash will help you create
[416.74s -> 421.22s]  space if you see yourself surrounded and will damage all the enemies around you moving the stick
[421.78s -> 425.14s]  towards the lower left corner and making a semi-circle the character rotates on itself
[425.14s -> 436.52s]  with a sword so you go down and all the way around okay extended what oh all attacks
[436.52s -> 439.88s]  consume stamina so be careful not to exhaust yourself in front of the enemy also the enemy
[439.88s -> 444.44s]  attacks a similar property so try to avoid guarding against a thrust so how do you guard
[445.26s -> 449.58s]  the yummy is the bow you will use throughout the adventure it can be very powerful
[450.14s -> 454.86s]  I can hear it but the amount of arrows is limited so use them wisely
[455.42s -> 463.51s]  I'm still here to equip the bow hold left bumper you can aim with the left stick to tighten it
[463.51s -> 469.58s]  and to move the right stick okay hold that bumper you can aim with left stick
[469.58s -> 475.05s]  to tighten it more move the right stick back and let go to shoot okay I'm gonna just play
[475.05s -> 480.66s]  around release left bumper to put the away the bow so you hold it pattern to the same
[480.66s -> 487.94s]  with keyboard and mouse I was recommended that I use a controller for this a good defense can
[487.94s -> 492.34s]  be decisive in any fight by holding left trigger you you'll start defending enemy attacks
[492.98s -> 497.22s]  you can continue moving with the left stick and you can choose the direction to look
[497.22s -> 501.62s]  to with the right stick this will also help so also make you lock on to the closest
[501.62s -> 507.86s]  enemy in that direction while defending your stamina will not recover as fast in their case
[507.86s -> 512.98s]  it's blocking if your stamina runs out your defense will break remember that arrows or thrust
[512.98s -> 516.98s]  cannot be stopped by defending in that blocking vertical cuts will drain a massive amount of
[516.98s -> 520.34s]  stamina don't worry if you can't remember all the attack patterns you can read it all again in
[520.34s -> 526.49s]  the weapon section of your inventory okay you need it now it's time to fight remember draw your
[526.49s -> 564.07s]  katana what was lock on right bumper okay here we go oh fuck do I don't have any arrows come
[564.07s -> 572.22s]  here fuck come on thrash him oh yeah I can dodge too there's like a dodge roll how good
[572.22s -> 581.53s]  is it how much health is he okay he's dead rest in peace young man the goblins behind
[581.53s -> 590.68s]  me stop stop stop stop stop rest in peace young man this is actually kind of fun it's not bad
[590.68s -> 603.67s]  there's no turning back now I can run as you can see on your left there are different types
[603.67s -> 609.59s]  of items in the game that represent it as packages red packages are food and recovery
[609.59s -> 615.77s]  health green ones contain drinks to increase maximum stamina temporarily and finally purple
[615.77s -> 620.49s]  contains bandages to heal bleeding and recover maximum health or wet stones to sharpen your
[620.49s -> 627.86s]  katana those bandages for bleeding and wet stones to sharpen katana not all objects will
[627.86s -> 630.74s]  have the same effect and some will be more effective than others also you'll find packs
[630.74s -> 637.37s]  of arrows for your bow or keys that allow you to open new areas get that mouse off the screen
[637.37s -> 641.21s]  the number of packages you can carry is limited to five for each item and 15 for
[641.21s -> 645.77s]  the arrows use them wisely navigate with the d-pad through your inventory press x to use the
[645.77s -> 655.40s]  selected object did I mute the music no I didn't you can also see a small table with a
[655.48s -> 660.95s]  brush ink and paper on it this is a save point and there are many more throughout your adventure
[660.95s -> 664.87s]  it is very important that every time you see one save your progress on it or you could lose
[664.87s -> 674.23s]  your valuable time since there are no checkpoints in the game be careful god damn it that's right
[674.23s -> 689.70s]  no checkpoints why don't you play mario tennis after this what the fuck up I got this okay

[2113.42s -> 2118.14s]  there some way to meet this person that's not possible he is an eccentric man who rarely
[2118.14s -> 2122.06s]  leaves his house inside of the gardens even for most of us who work there would be
[2122.06s -> 2128.30s]  difficult so you work there could you let me in the next time what do you want to get us
[2128.30s -> 2132.38s]  killed listen you don't know these people they don't like outsiders and they are ruthless a lot

[2135.58s -> 2141.35s]  protection and we have it but they treat us like dogs we work all day for them and they
[2141.35s -> 2145.11s]  barely give us enough food to survive particularly the captain of the guard is
[2145.11s -> 2152.25s]  really rotten they even arrested my daughter for confronting him she's just a kid I don't even
[2152.25s -> 2155.85s]  know if I will see her again I'm not gonna do anything that could harm her we shouldn't

[4118.92s -> 4134.49s]  island stream from the island hold competitions this is gonna get real ugly if i do not get
[4135.61s -> 4150.38s]  a sharpening stone survive on a desert island stream did i actually just miss how embarrassing
[4151.02s -> 4177.35s]  that's an embarrassment oh this is bad oh shameful display all right last attempt and i'm
[4177.35s -> 4182.52s]  gonna go take a piss and we're gonna come back and i'm gonna and i'm gonna delete the vod no
[4182.52s -> 4197.40s]  i'm just kidding how am i supposed to all right here's my one gripe that i have with
[4197.40s -> 4206.25s]  the game so there's a mechanic where you the weapon dulls so you could be walking around
[4206.25s -> 4216.04s]  with a useless weapon but are there any other weapons to use because what happens if i just
[4216.04s -> 4223.02s]  don't if i don't find a whetstone here is just i just lose i have to hit the people
[4223.02s -> 4254.92s]  two or three times as many times zero sharpness is 50 less damage that sucks i wouldn't call
[4254.92s -> 4261.98s]  it a soft lock i would just i mean it's hard to handle i don't know block she went
[4261.98s -> 4272.60s]  through that oh man all right am i playing anything else yeah i'm gonna just play picked
[4272.60s -> 4280.54s]  up picks and we're just gonna chill it's a thrust yeah i have to like dodge the thrust
[4281.26s -> 4298.28s]  because i really am just screwed i need health i need my weapon is dull i need to shoot that
[4298.28s -> 4301.78s]  person with arrows that's so much easier because i don't think she can i don't think
[4301.78s -> 4313.77s]  they can block it oh my god she can dodge it though very easily and here comes the whole
[4313.77s -> 4335.62s]  zone all right i'll be right back we're gonna reboot we're gonna reboot the stream here i'm
[4335.62s -> 4340.62s]  just gonna come back and we're gonna play picked up picks and i'm gonna internal sunshine
[4340.62s -> 4348.01s]  of the spotless mine this game and then no that was fine the game was it was interesting
[4350.06s -> 4356.46s]  uh that's another 50 dollars from communist taco just came in right now or a minute ago
[4357.98s -> 4361.50s]  thank you thank you thank you for the fucking crazy amount of money hey jeremy use this to
[4361.50s -> 4374.17s]  buy the ps2 version of space channel 5 i don't think it's 50 bucks and i'm not sure i want
[4374.17s -> 4381.22s]  to do that but let me i'll be right back let me just grab some water and we're gonna
[4381.22s -> 4387.24s]  we're gonna hop into picked up picks and we're just gonna relax i'm just gonna be an old
