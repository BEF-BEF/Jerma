[44.86s -> 707.11s]  These? These are my sub-girls.
[707.11s -> 722.92s]  Hey! Whoa!
[722.92s -> 724.92s]  Dama!
[724.92s -> 726.92s]  Tipatalo!
[726.92s -> 780.42s]  Look at Andrew.
[780.42s -> 783.43s]  That's right. Look at Andrew. Never heard of him.
[783.43s -> 830.34s]  I'm going to see my armpits. So I'll lift my arms up.
[830.34s -> 837.51s]  Yep!
[837.51s -> 979.11s]  My sub-girls.
[979.11s -> 1012.46s]  Yep!
[1012.46s -> 1198.98s]  Yep!
[1198.98s -> 1229.64s]  Can't breathe without these.
[1229.64s -> 1314.44s]  I feel like I'm making a TikTok video.
[1314.44s -> 1316.44s]  Who'd say like this is the lip I was doing?
[1316.44s -> 1320.65s]  Whoo!
[1320.65s -> 1353.21s]  Just a little too big.
[1353.21s -> 1355.21s]  Can't breathe without these.
[1355.21s -> 1494.09s]  I feel like I'm making a TikTok video.
[1494.09s -> 1578.76s]  Who'd say like this is the lip I was doing?
[1578.76s -> 1580.76s]  Whoo!
[1580.76s -> 1594.06s]  Just a little too big.
[1594.06s -> 1618.63s]  Can't breathe without these.
[1618.63s -> 1757.64s]  I broke the watch.
[1757.64s -> 1974.71s]  We should have started like five minutes ago.
[1974.71s -> 1976.71s]  We had to tape the watch on my hand.
[1976.71s -> 1979.02s]  I was putting it on and I was panicking.
[1979.02s -> 1981.58s]  And the thing just like shattered in my hands.
[1981.58s -> 1983.58s]  But anyways, how was it?
[1983.58s -> 1986.46s]  I broke the watch on my hands.
[1986.46s -> 1988.46s]  But anyways, hi. Welcome to day two of the dollhouse.
[1988.46s -> 1990.46s]  Do you need an introduction?
[1990.46s -> 1992.46s]  Should I give you an introduction?
[1992.46s -> 1994.46s]  Or do you already know how this works?
[1994.46s -> 1996.46s]  You should by now.
[1996.46s -> 1998.46s]  I'm going to go take a look inside.
[1998.46s -> 2000.46s]  Oh my god! I look fucking awful!
[2000.46s -> 2002.46s]  I'm going to be so self-conscious.
[2002.46s -> 2004.46s]  I don't wear this shit.
[2004.46s -> 2006.46s]  You understand?
[2006.46s -> 2008.46s]  In my own home I don't wear this.
[2008.46s -> 2010.46s]  Because I'm embarrassed about my neck
[2010.46s -> 2012.46s]  and shoulders and stomach come out.
[2012.46s -> 2014.46s]  And I think you can see my nipples through the shirt.
[2014.46s -> 2016.46s]  But I'm going to try to do my best to make sure you can't see that.
[2016.46s -> 2020.02s]  Let's go in the house.
[2020.02s -> 2024.25s]  The seats have been cleaned up.
[2024.25s -> 2026.25s]  You notice something in the trash out there?
[2026.25s -> 2028.25s]  Because I'm not sleeping on that fucking mattress.
[2028.25s -> 2030.25s]  That's not going to happen.
[2030.25s -> 2032.25s]  I'm not sleeping on that.
[2032.25s -> 2034.25s]  Because it's actually dirty.
[2034.25s -> 2036.55s]  Actually dirty.
[2036.55s -> 2041.16s]  I look like a fucking idiot.
[2041.16s -> 2045.43s]  You know the bathroom?
[2045.43s -> 2047.43s]  Probably pretty well at this point I would assume.
[2047.43s -> 2049.74s]  I love this bathroom.
[2049.74s -> 2051.74s]  Although I could use a little bit more stuff.
[2051.74s -> 2053.74s]  Please be aware.
[2053.74s -> 2057.74s]  You are in control of 98% of everything that happens on this stream.
[2057.74s -> 2061.26s]  Just be aware of that.
[2061.26s -> 2063.88s]  Should we check this door?
[2063.88s -> 2066.44s]  What do you think? Should I go in here?
[2066.44s -> 2069.00s]  Does this door work? We'll find out.
[2069.00s -> 2075.08s]  I can't open it. It's locked.
[2075.08s -> 2080.12s]  Oh!
[2080.12s -> 2082.12s]  That's where the bed is.
[2082.12s -> 2084.12s]  That's right. I built it.
[2084.12s -> 2086.12s]  It was broken.
[2086.12s -> 2089.38s]  That's why I decided to put it.
[2089.38s -> 2091.38s]  Because you got it for me at the end of the stream.
[2091.38s -> 2093.38s]  It took me like six hours to build it.
[2093.38s -> 2098.81s]  This is nice and comfy.
[2104.81s -> 2106.98s]  I actually kind of like how this looks.
[2106.98s -> 2109.93s]  Can we see?
[2109.93s -> 2111.93s]  Can you get it?
[2111.93s -> 2113.93s]  Can I like home shopping network this thing?
[2113.93s -> 2117.56s]  It's so stupid.
[2117.56s -> 2119.56s]  I feel like that mouse.
[2119.56s -> 2121.56s]  Who I'm not going to say on a stream like this.
[2121.56s -> 2123.56s]  I feel like that mouse wears this kind of stuff.
[2123.56s -> 2125.56s]  I feel like he has like 30 of these.
[2125.56s -> 2127.56s]  But we never see him wear it.
[2127.56s -> 2129.56s]  I guarantee he hasn't.
[2129.56s -> 2131.86s]  Welcome back though.
[2131.86s -> 2133.86s]  Actually, you know from the front.
[2133.86s -> 2135.86s]  From the front it looks okay.
[2135.86s -> 2137.86s]  But from the side it doesn't.
[2137.86s -> 2140.42s]  I need to like get a bigger chest.
[2140.42s -> 2143.05s]  But I got like these flickering arms.
[2143.05s -> 2145.05s]  Like I'm going to.
[2145.05s -> 2147.61s]  I can go like that.
[2147.61s -> 2150.42s]  I love the bedroom.
[2150.42s -> 2155.03s]  You got more choices now, don't you?
[2155.03s -> 2158.10s]  Toilet? I don't have to go.
[2158.10s -> 2160.10s]  Just so you can be aware that it is available.
[2160.10s -> 2162.10s]  Eventually I probably want to take these gloves off.
[2162.10s -> 2167.93s]  Enjoy the game.
[2167.93s -> 2169.93s]  Good luck.
[2169.93s -> 2172.55s]  I got full bars.
[2172.55s -> 2179.27s]  Which means I can do this.
[2179.27s -> 2181.77s]  That's embarrassing. I just did that.
[2181.77s -> 2185.86s]  How many people are here?
[2185.86s -> 2187.86s]  That was like actually pretty embarrassing to do with this many people.
[2187.86s -> 2189.86s]  73,000 people just watched me do that.
[2189.86s -> 2191.86s]  That's like embarrassing.
[2191.86s -> 2193.86s]  Back in like during like school plays.
[2193.86s -> 2195.86s]  There'd be like fucking 40 people in the audience.
[2195.86s -> 2216.14s]  They're...
[2216.14s -> 2218.14s]  No, I'm not peeing on them.
[2218.14s -> 2220.57s]  I'm not peeing on the flowers.
[2220.57s -> 2222.57s]  Why is that the piss sound?
[2222.57s -> 2224.57s]  That's not water flowers.
[2224.57s -> 2228.86s]  I'm going to stand like this.
[2228.86s -> 2230.86s]  So people don't think that's what's happening.
[2230.86s -> 2232.86s]  I enjoyed that very much though.
[2232.86s -> 2235.86s]  I did.
[2235.86s -> 2237.86s]  I'll tell you from the front this looks good.
[2237.86s -> 2241.38s]  Wait a minute.
[2241.38s -> 2246.18s]  We're going to do the same joke from the other day.
[2246.18s -> 2249.38s]  I still got it.
[2249.38s -> 2251.88s]  But what I was going to say is
[2251.88s -> 2253.88s]  back when I was a young, young boy
[2253.88s -> 2255.88s]  there'd be
[2255.88s -> 2257.88s]  school plays.
[2257.88s -> 2259.88s]  You're in like the fourth grade, the fifth grade.
[2259.88s -> 2261.88s]  Only people's parents
[2261.88s -> 2263.88s]  came to that shit.
[2263.88s -> 2265.88s]  Maybe the principal, maybe the old lady
[2265.88s -> 2267.88s]  that played the piano during the entire show.
[2267.88s -> 2269.88s]  She would just
[2269.88s -> 2271.88s]  every scene it would be like
[2271.88s -> 2273.88s]  that lady was like super into it.
[2273.88s -> 2275.88s]  I kind of wish we had one of those ladies.
[2275.88s -> 2277.88s]  We don't.
[2277.88s -> 2279.88s]  But the difference is
[2279.88s -> 2281.88s]  with 40 people's parents it's 70,000 people.
[2281.88s -> 2284.12s]  I don't know how many of you are.
[2284.12s -> 2286.12s]  Actually I think my mother is watching.
[2286.12s -> 2290.86s]  I'm going to go lie in the bed.
[2290.86s -> 2292.86s]  I'm going to go check the bed out.
[2292.86s -> 2297.59s]  Parasocial Andy.
[2297.59s -> 2303.59s]  What?
[2303.59s -> 2306.92s]  I'm going to check the bed out.
[2306.92s -> 2310.81s]  Okay.
[2310.81s -> 2312.98s]  There it is. There's the first one.
[2312.98s -> 2325.21s]  I actually
[2325.21s -> 2327.21s]  talked about the fart thing.
[2327.21s -> 2329.21s]  And I said five farts an hour.
[2329.21s -> 2331.21s]  There's more than five farts an hour.
[2331.21s -> 2333.21s]  So it's going to be in a lot of trouble.
[2333.21s -> 2335.21s]  It was five fart sounds an hour.
[2335.21s -> 2338.22s]  There was one.
[2338.22s -> 2343.02s]  I want you to keep track.
[2343.02s -> 2354.41s]  Okay, let's go.
[2354.41s -> 2361.70s]  I'll watch out for that manhole.
[2361.70s -> 2376.10s]  Do you see the mattress?
[2376.10s -> 2381.10s]  I'm in the right clothes for this.
[2381.10s -> 2385.24s]  Ugh.
[2385.24s -> 2387.61s]  Not sleeping on this.
[2387.61s -> 2389.61s]  We actually talked about this after day one.
[2389.61s -> 2392.04s]  I'm like
[2392.04s -> 2394.04s]  not a chance that I actually lie on this.
[2394.04s -> 2403.69s]  No way.
[2403.69s -> 2406.06s]  I got the popcorn maker.
[2406.06s -> 2408.81s]  Except it doesn't do anything.
[2408.81s -> 2427.30s]  Because I don't want to get electrocuted.
[2427.30s -> 2433.45s]  Check mail. Sure.
[2433.45s -> 2440.98s]  Why not? Mail.
[2440.98s -> 2451.85s]  Check the mail. What's in the mail today?
[2451.85s -> 2458.12s]  Let's find out.
[2458.12s -> 2460.62s]  This is somebody's shoe that's here.
[2460.62s -> 2462.62s]  Somebody actually on set here.
[2462.62s -> 2464.62s]  This is their shoe.
[2464.62s -> 2470.57s]  I don't know whose it is, but I don't know why it's in here.
[2470.57s -> 2473.06s]  What is it?
[2473.06s -> 2476.20s]  Has somebody worn this
[2476.20s -> 2478.95s]  in the last few days?
[2478.95s -> 2484.78s]  Money?
[2484.78s -> 2489.00s]  There's twenty bucks in the shoe.
[2489.00s -> 2491.00s]  Who would do this?
[2491.00s -> 2493.30s]  What kind of fucked up neighborhood is this?
[2497.64s -> 2500.52s]  Thanks for the twenty dollars.
[2500.52s -> 2502.52s]  What do we start with? Three hundred?
[2502.52s -> 2506.28s]  So that's what? Three twenty?
[2506.28s -> 2510.31s]  How much money? Forty? What?
[2510.31s -> 2512.31s]  I thought we started with three hundred dollars.
[2512.31s -> 2516.92s]  Oh, they bought the upgraded house.
[2516.92s -> 2518.92s]  Right. But why don't we have any money?
[2518.92s -> 2521.16s]  How are we supposed to get any money?
[2521.16s -> 2523.16s]  How are they going to buy anything?
[2523.16s -> 2527.51s]  I'm talking to you.
[2527.51s -> 2529.51s]  Remember, I have to go to work to make money.
[2529.51s -> 2536.87s]  If you don't send me to work, then it's not going to happen.
[2536.87s -> 2542.10s]  Oh! Got you.
[2542.10s -> 2545.62s]  I actually hit myself in the head.
[2545.62s -> 2547.62s]  I went for like a joke.
[2549.62s -> 2551.62s]  And I didn't fucking get it right.
[2551.62s -> 2555.46s]  My knee was in the wrong place
[2555.46s -> 2557.46s]  and that actually just hit me right in the forehead.
[2557.46s -> 2560.15s]  Ah!
[2560.15s -> 2562.52s]  I do actually feel pretty... I need to take a shower.
[2562.52s -> 2569.18s]  Let me get in here.
[2569.18s -> 2574.60s]  Don't close that.
[2574.60s -> 2577.86s]  I just figured it out.
[2577.86s -> 2579.86s]  You got to keep these bars green, otherwise how am I going to get promoted?
[2579.86s -> 2581.86s]  How are you going to make more money?
[2581.86s -> 2585.38s]  How are you going to be able to get more stuff in the house?
[2585.38s -> 2587.38s]  You can't, unless you actually
[2587.38s -> 2589.38s]  play and get me there.
[2589.38s -> 2592.07s]  I want green bars.
[2592.07s -> 2600.63s]  Coming up. Coming up.
[2600.63s -> 2614.65s]  I hit the watch.
[2614.65s -> 2616.65s]  I'm getting a little tired though.
[2619.53s -> 2623.18s]  Starting to wane a little.
[2623.18s -> 2625.18s]  I want cool items. I want fun stuff.
[2625.18s -> 2627.18s]  I want things to lie down on.
[2627.18s -> 2629.18s]  I want things to play with.
[2629.18s -> 2631.18s]  I don't just want...
[2631.18s -> 2633.80s]  What was that?
[2633.80s -> 2635.80s]  Go to work. I missed work by like four hours already.
[2635.80s -> 2639.43s]  Go to work?
[2639.43s -> 2641.99s]  Alright, I'm going to work.
[2641.99s -> 2643.99s]  Alright, fine.
[2643.99s -> 2647.26s]  I'm going to work.
[2647.26s -> 2657.11s]  I'm coming!
[2657.11s -> 2682.65s]  Night shift.
[2682.65s -> 2686.92s]  Thanks for the ride.
[2686.92s -> 2696.50s]  Goodbye!
[2696.50s -> 2698.50s]  That just made me wane.
[2698.50s -> 2701.00s]  That just made me tired.
[2701.00s -> 2703.00s]  That just brought my energy to zero.
[2707.29s -> 2709.29s]  It wasn't working for like six or seven hours.
[2709.29s -> 2711.29s]  It was doing the goodbye
[2711.29s -> 2713.29s]  like five times
[2713.29s -> 2716.04s]  is what made me tired.
[2716.04s -> 2721.29s]  I'm exhausted though.
[2721.29s -> 2728.14s]  Tired and a little hungry.
[2728.14s -> 2730.76s]  At least we made some money.
[2730.76s -> 2732.76s]  I'm hungry though.
[2732.76s -> 2735.77s]  How much money is in the account now?
[2735.77s -> 2737.77s]  $200? $140?
[2737.77s -> 2739.77s]  I'm going to my bedroom.
[2739.77s -> 2741.77s]  I haven't been able to sit in here for very long.
[2741.77s -> 2743.77s]  I'm going to my bedroom which is a little odd.
[2748.68s -> 2750.68s]  I'm going to lock myself out of one of these rooms eventually.
[2750.68s -> 2756.44s]  Oh man.
[2756.44s -> 2763.54s]  Tired.
[2763.54s -> 2767.82s]  Make a phone call. Who am I calling?
[2767.82s -> 2769.82s]  Call who?
[2769.82s -> 2772.31s]  Who am I calling?
[2772.31s -> 2775.51s]  I got a call?
[2775.51s -> 2777.82s]  No sleeping?
[2777.82s -> 2779.82s]  What are you talking about?
[2779.82s -> 2788.50s]  Oh!
[2788.50s -> 2796.25s]  Mom!
[2796.25s -> 2799.37s]  Yeah, it's me.
[2799.37s -> 2801.86s]  Yeah, it's been an interesting day or two.
[2801.86s -> 2804.49s]  It's actually really remarkable
[2804.49s -> 2806.49s]  that I can even talk to you mom
[2806.49s -> 2808.49s]  considering that I just pulled the line out of the wall.
[2808.49s -> 2810.49s]  So this is really good.
[2810.49s -> 2812.49s]  Some kind of alien technology which is interesting.
[2812.49s -> 2814.92s]  Oh yeah, no, hi. Hello, sorry.
[2814.92s -> 2816.92s]  I forgot to say like hi. How are you?
[2816.92s -> 2819.10s]  Yeah, it's good to hear your voice.
[2819.10s -> 2821.10s]  You're the only person I know.
[2821.10s -> 2823.10s]  That's kind of interesting.
[2823.10s -> 2826.17s]  Yeah, yeah.
[2826.17s -> 3233.19s]  And so I...
[3233.19s -> 3235.75s]  Oh, what?
[3235.75s -> 3238.70s]  Right, right, this shit.
[3238.70s -> 3254.95s]  That's right.
[3254.95s -> 3262.49s]  Okay, my couch is fucking ugly.
[3262.49s -> 3265.50s]  Mom?
[3265.50s -> 3269.46s]  Are you still on the phone?
[3269.46s -> 3273.24s]  Mom? I don't know.
[3273.24s -> 3275.24s]  Hopefully she thinks I'm alright.
[3275.24s -> 3277.42s]  Let me put this back.
[3277.42s -> 3282.20s]  What is this?
[3282.20s -> 3284.95s]  Can I get this back on?
[3284.95s -> 3287.82s]  Yeah, whatever, it'll stay.
[3287.82s -> 3289.82s]  Oh, yes! Oh, I love that!
[3289.82s -> 3292.31s]  Oh, sofa!
[3292.31s -> 3294.31s]  Ew. Yuck.
[3294.31s -> 3299.69s]  Yuck.
[3299.69s -> 3314.46s]  What is this? I don't want that.
[3314.46s -> 3316.46s]  I want one piece of singular bread.
[3316.46s -> 3325.61s]  I feel awful.
[3325.61s -> 3328.04s]  I hate sleeping on the ground.
[3328.04s -> 3330.04s]  Let me go to bed, alright?
[3330.04s -> 3332.04s]  Like, okay, there's a sofa here now.
[3332.04s -> 3334.04s]  There's a bed in the other room.
[3334.04s -> 3336.04s]  Don't make me use the phone.
[3336.04s -> 3338.04s]  If my energy's low and I'm just...
[3338.04s -> 3340.04s]  I'm hangry, alright? Just let me talk to you for a second.
[3340.04s -> 3342.04s]  If you put me in the bed and let me go to sleep,
[3342.04s -> 3344.04s]  then this won't happen.
[3344.04s -> 3346.04s]  You'll have plenty of opportunity and I'm gonna piss my shit
[3346.04s -> 3354.10s]  shit my pants.
[3354.10s -> 3356.10s]  I'm just eating a piece of bread. I'm eating one piece of bread.
[3356.10s -> 3365.75s]  It's good.
[3365.75s -> 3368.18s]  It's actually pretty good.
[3368.18s -> 3371.19s]  This is a good bread.
[3371.19s -> 3373.75s]  What kind of bread is this?
[3373.75s -> 3375.75s]  It's multigrain.
[3375.75s -> 3377.75s]  I eat multigrain bread.
[3377.75s -> 3379.75s]  I don't. I actually think that stuff's gross.
[3379.75s -> 3386.58s]  Okay, that was good.
[3386.58s -> 3391.51s]  Delicious.
[3391.51s -> 3393.51s]  Don't just leave it.
[3393.51s -> 3399.72s]  Disgusting.
[3399.72s -> 3405.53s]  I'm gonna do a thing that everybody does.
[3405.53s -> 3407.53s]  I'm gonna go to work.
[3407.53s -> 3416.98s]  Wait. Wait for me.
[3416.98s -> 3422.23s]  Wait for me.
[3422.23s -> 3460.76s]  One just full piece of white bread.
[3460.76s -> 3462.76s]  I've been at work all day trying to eat.
[3466.28s -> 3468.28s]  I've been chewing this single piece of white bread
[3468.28s -> 3470.28s]  for fucking six hours.
[3470.28s -> 3473.16s]  It's like eating saltines.
[3473.16s -> 3478.98s]  Everybody at work thought I was chewing gum.
[3478.98s -> 3480.98s]  I was like, no, I ate a whole
[3480.98s -> 3482.98s]  piece of white bread before I came in.
[3482.98s -> 3486.38s]  They were like, dude,
[3486.38s -> 3488.38s]  what did you have for breakfast today?
[3488.38s -> 3490.38s]  The first time I went like this
[3490.38s -> 3492.38s]  with a piece of white bread,
[3492.38s -> 3494.38s]  and they were like, do you want to go to McDonald's?
[3494.38s -> 3502.04s]  I'm like, I don't know. No.
[3502.04s -> 3504.04s]  I'm fucking horrible.
[3504.04s -> 3515.86s]  I feel awful.
[3515.86s -> 3518.55s]  I can see it.
[3518.55s -> 3522.14s]  I can see it.
[3522.14s -> 3529.24s]  Please help me.
[3529.24s -> 3531.67s]  Please help me.
[3531.67s -> 3533.67s]  Please. I can see it.
[3533.67s -> 3535.67s]  I can literally see the fucking toilet
[3535.67s -> 3540.58s]  in front of me.
[3540.58s -> 3544.15s]  What was that?
[3544.15s -> 3546.15s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[3546.15s -> 3552.66s]  Who's at the door?
[3552.66s -> 3554.66s]  This is my pants.
[3554.66s -> 3558.82s]  I'm coming.
[3558.82s -> 3564.46s]  Uncle Ted.
[3564.46s -> 3566.46s]  It's been so long.
[3566.46s -> 3569.08s]  What is he doing here?
[3569.08s -> 3571.08s]  I went to spring training. I told your mother I was going.
[3573.08s -> 3575.08s]  Look at the nice couch you got here.
[3575.08s -> 3577.32s]  You got good taste.
[3577.32s -> 3579.32s]  He's dead.
[3579.32s -> 3581.32s]  What are you doing here?
[3581.32s -> 3583.32s]  Give me a hug.
[3583.32s -> 3585.32s]  He's so fucking cold.
[3585.32s -> 3587.32s]  He's freezing.
[3587.32s -> 3589.32s]  What's the matter with you?
[3589.32s -> 3591.32s]  Let's go.
[3591.32s -> 3593.32s]  I went to my house.
[3593.32s -> 3595.32s]  I went to my house. You know what's there?
[3595.32s -> 3597.32s]  Nothing. I got no furniture.
[3597.32s -> 3599.62s]  That looks familiar.
[3599.62s -> 3601.62s]  I don't know what God I angered.
[3601.62s -> 3603.62s]  I'm sorry.
[3603.62s -> 3605.62s]  Oh, you like my couch?
[3605.62s -> 3607.62s]  It's beautiful.
[3607.62s -> 3609.62s]  I haven't had a beer in about 50...
[3609.62s -> 3611.62s]  Gemma!
[3611.62s -> 3614.44s]  Hey, hey, Uncle Ted!
[3614.44s -> 3616.44s]  You're going to pee so bad.
[3616.44s -> 3618.44s]  Uncle Ted!
[3618.44s -> 3620.44s]  There's a fucking ghost in my house.
[3620.44s -> 3622.74s]  This motherfucker is dead.
[3622.74s -> 3624.74s]  Gemma!
[3624.74s -> 3626.74s]  Is that the bathroom?
[3626.74s -> 3628.74s]  No, no, no.
[3628.74s -> 3630.74s]  I need to do something about this.
[3630.74s -> 3632.74s]  He has to pass on.
[3632.74s -> 3634.74s]  I've got all the time in the world.
[3634.74s -> 3637.50s]  The ghost of the goddamn walking dead.
[3637.50s -> 3639.50s]  Take your time.
[3639.50s -> 3641.67s]  Sometimes it takes a little while.
[3643.67s -> 3645.91s]  Lord, start at 100.
[3645.91s -> 3647.91s]  I'm going to pass him on to the other world.
[3647.91s -> 3649.91s]  I don't know what happened. I don't know what God I angered.
[3649.91s -> 3651.91s]  I don't know what I did. I don't know who I'm angering.
[3651.91s -> 3653.91s]  I'm going to run to Donald.
[3653.91s -> 3655.91s]  Gemma!
[3655.91s -> 3657.91s]  Gemma!
[3657.91s -> 3659.91s]  I'm going to get him to the other side. That would be fantastic.
[3659.91s -> 3661.91s]  I don't want to be haunted anymore. I want to pass on wealth.
[3661.91s -> 3664.41s]  Look at my spoons.
[3664.41s -> 3666.41s]  Those are my spoons. That looks like my couch.
[3666.41s -> 3668.41s]  I'm going to shit my pants.
[3668.41s -> 3676.58s]  I got that one.
[3676.58s -> 3679.85s]  I got that one in Dollywood.
[3679.85s -> 3681.85s]  Hey!
[3681.85s -> 3684.09s]  I love my grandson.
[3684.09s -> 3686.09s]  Hey, so how are you?
[3686.09s -> 3688.90s]  Are you ready for Uncle Ted?
[3688.90s -> 3690.90s]  You're not supposed to be here, Ted.
[3690.90s -> 3692.90s]  I'm not supposed to be here.
[3692.90s -> 3694.90s]  I had to get your address off somebody
[3694.90s -> 3696.90s]  because your mother, freaking mother, my sister,
[3696.90s -> 3698.90s]  my house is empty of furniture.
[3698.90s -> 3700.90s]  But this looks familiar. That looks familiar.
[3700.90s -> 3702.90s]  And those are my spoons.
[3702.90s -> 3704.90s]  I got that one in Dollywood.
[3704.90s -> 3706.90s]  I got that one in...
[3706.90s -> 3708.90s]  I've got a ghost that needs to go to the other goddamn side.
[3708.90s -> 3710.90s]  He's haunting me.
[3710.90s -> 3712.90s]  Come on.
[3712.90s -> 3714.90s]  Yeah, you're coming as soon as you can.
[3714.90s -> 3716.90s]  Ted, Ted, how are you?
[3716.90s -> 3718.90s]  Who's on the phone?
[3718.90s -> 3720.90s]  I was just calling my friend,
[3720.90s -> 3722.90s]  Granit Reapelson.
[3722.90s -> 3724.90s]  Granit Reapelson?
[3724.90s -> 3726.90s]  Yeah, they're an old family friend.
[3726.90s -> 3728.90s]  You played soccer with him, didn't you?
[3728.90s -> 3730.90s]  I went to one of your games and you played soccer with him.
[3730.90s -> 3732.90s]  I did, I did.
[3732.90s -> 3734.90s]  Did you go to the other world?
[3734.90s -> 3736.90s]  No, I'm good.
[3736.90s -> 3738.90s]  There's no money hidden under any mattresses?
[3738.90s -> 3740.90s]  No, actually, I had no money.
[3740.90s -> 3742.90s]  Somebody cleaned out my account when I was in spring training.
[3742.90s -> 3744.90s]  I went down to see this octet.
[3744.90s -> 3746.90s]  Let me get the door.
[3746.90s -> 3748.90s]  Just stay there for a minute.
[3748.90s -> 3750.90s]  Stay there for just a second.
[3752.90s -> 3754.90s]  I'm here for Ted.
[3754.90s -> 3756.90s]  Please come in.
[3756.90s -> 3761.69s]  Where does this go?
[3761.69s -> 3763.69s]  Yeah, he's over here. He's having some trouble
[3763.69s -> 3765.69s]  on the other side, if you could.
[3765.69s -> 3767.69s]  Hey, how are you?
[3767.69s -> 3769.69s]  This is my friend.
[3769.69s -> 3771.69s]  By the way, I don't think I've ever said about you.
[3771.69s -> 3773.69s]  It was just a joke.
[3773.69s -> 3775.69s]  If there's anything you need to say to me,
[3775.69s -> 3777.69s]  should I know anything about anything?
[3777.69s -> 3779.69s]  Dress up? Is this dress up?
[3779.69s -> 3781.69s]  Ted.
[3781.69s -> 3783.69s]  Yeah, yeah, it is.
[3783.69s -> 3785.69s]  It's time for you to come home, Ted.
[3785.69s -> 3787.69s]  It's time.
[3787.69s -> 3789.69s]  Well, there's no furniture in my home.
[3789.69s -> 3791.69s]  No, Ted, not that kind of home.
[3791.69s -> 3795.69s]  It's time for the long farewell, Ted.
[3795.69s -> 3798.38s]  I'm feeling kind of cold.
[3798.38s -> 3800.38s]  Shh.
[3800.38s -> 3802.38s]  No more tears.
[3802.38s -> 3804.38s]  Only dreams.
[3804.38s -> 3806.38s]  Come on. Come on now.
[3806.38s -> 3808.38s]  Here we go. There you are. That's right.
[3808.38s -> 3810.38s]  I'm not dead.
[3810.38s -> 3812.38s]  You're not dead, yes.
[3812.38s -> 3814.38s]  They all say that, Ted. They all say that.
[3814.38s -> 3816.38s]  Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma.
[3816.38s -> 3818.38s]  Jerma can't help you now, Ted.
[3818.38s -> 3820.38s]  Fucking family.
[3820.38s -> 3824.38s]  Come on. I've got a spot picked out for you right here.
[3824.38s -> 3826.38s]  Come on, Ted. Right this way.
[3826.38s -> 3828.38s]  There you go.
[3828.38s -> 3832.74s]  Shh. I'm going to take good care of you, Ted.
[3832.74s -> 3837.22s]  Off we go now.
[3837.22s -> 3841.70s]  This is the worst I've ever felt in my whole life.
[3841.70s -> 3845.22s]  What did he fucking do?
[3845.22s -> 3847.22s]  Why did he come here?
[3847.22s -> 3849.72s]  Fucking haunted by my Uncle Ted.
[3849.72s -> 3851.72s]  I tried to make amends and shit.
[3851.72s -> 3856.14s]  I don't even know.
[3856.14s -> 3858.14s]  I have to go to the bathroom.
[3858.14s -> 3866.78s]  It's here. Press it.
[3898.10s -> 3900.60s]  Jesus.
[3900.60s -> 3905.72s]  Holy. Goodness.
[3908.47s -> 3914.98s]  Okay.
[3914.98s -> 3916.98s]  The water's starting to come up over the lip.
[3916.98s -> 3935.59s]  I don't care.
[3935.59s -> 3937.59s]  You know when you have to pee a lot
[3937.59s -> 3939.59s]  and it just hurts still.
[3939.59s -> 3941.59s]  It hurts. Up here it hurts.
[3941.59s -> 3943.59s]  Right here it hurts.
[3943.59s -> 3945.59s]  All the way to here. This is killing me.
[3945.59s -> 3947.59s]  Oh, like I emptied everything
[3947.59s -> 3949.59s]  but it's just like this pain now.
[3949.59s -> 3951.59s]  Are you going to let that go again?
[3951.59s -> 3959.27s]  Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
[3959.27s -> 3961.27s]  And I'm going to say a prayer for Ted too
[3961.27s -> 3963.27s]  because being haunted by somebody
[3963.27s -> 3965.27s]  is just a very unnerving ass thing.
[3965.27s -> 3970.20s]  Oh, man.
[3970.20s -> 3978.31s]  I'm going to write about that in my blog tomorrow.
[3978.31s -> 3982.01s]  What should I title it?
[3982.01s -> 3986.01s]  My Uncle Going Through the Great Beyond.
[3986.01s -> 3988.38s]  Something like that.
[3988.38s -> 3991.37s]  I was fucked up.
[3991.37s -> 3993.37s]  What did I ever do to that motherfucker?
[3993.37s -> 3995.37s]  I didn't do anything.
[3995.37s -> 3998.70s]  I got money in the mail from him. That's it.
[3998.70s -> 4000.70s]  It was just the thing.
[4000.70s -> 4003.51s]  My mother called me and sold me.
[4003.51s -> 4005.51s]  What the fuck?
[4005.51s -> 4007.51s]  I don't know why I'm getting haunted by him.
[4007.51s -> 4011.35s]  Thank God he's on the way to the other side.
[4011.35s -> 4014.62s]  That's ten times better.
[4014.62s -> 4035.61s]  A hundred times better.
[4035.61s -> 4037.98s]  I'm not even fun anymore.
[4037.98s -> 4041.11s]  This is a nice watch though.
[4041.11s -> 4044.89s]  I don't want the clocks to come back.
[4044.89s -> 4047.26s]  Please do something.
[4047.26s -> 4049.26s]  I don't want the clowns to come back today.
[4049.26s -> 4054.23s]  Oh, yay!
[4054.23s -> 4062.49s]  Butterflies, but
[4062.49s -> 4064.79s]  they don't want to be caught.
[4064.79s -> 4067.86s]  They want to be free.
[4067.86s -> 4069.86s]  Butterflies don't want to be caught.
[4069.86s -> 4077.85s]  They want to be free outside.
[4077.85s -> 4086.36s]  No, I don't want to. Let me see.
[4086.36s -> 4088.36s]  There's one over here.
[4088.36s -> 4097.70s]  Oh, that's a monarch.
[4097.70s -> 4100.26s]  It's beautiful.
[4100.26s -> 4102.26s]  That's beautiful.
[4102.26s -> 4105.08s]  I think that might be a moth, but it's okay.
[4105.08s -> 4107.08s]  It sounds like I'm getting hit by a wave.
[4107.08s -> 4109.08s]  It's like, hold on.
[4109.08s -> 4111.08s]  That's kind of funny.
[4111.08s -> 4113.08s]  That's funny I can hear that.
[4113.08s -> 4121.02s]  That's kind of funny.
[4121.02s -> 4123.02s]  I can't move around too much. It's just a microphone.
[4123.02s -> 4128.95s]  Life fucks up. I'm tired though.
[4128.95s -> 4130.95s]  Oh, what's that butterfly?
[4130.95s -> 4132.95s]  Oh, I think that's a
[4132.95s -> 4134.95s]  green-tailed sparrow back.
[4134.95s -> 4137.45s]  Wow!
[4137.45s -> 4140.84s]  Maybe I should keep him.
[4140.84s -> 4144.42s]  Actual psycho?
[4144.42s -> 4146.42s]  I'm fucking tired.
[4146.42s -> 4148.92s]  Doorbell!
[4148.92s -> 4155.38s]  I didn't press it.
[4155.38s -> 4165.22s]  That was fun.
[4165.22s -> 4167.22s]  I feel better. No, that's two.
[4167.22s -> 4169.22s]  We have 30 minutes or 45 minutes to go before we even do three more.
[4169.22s -> 4180.54s]  Life and death.
[4180.54s -> 4184.95s]  When somebody comes into the world,
[4184.95s -> 4187.13s]  they're essentially created.
[4187.13s -> 4189.37s]  And when they're taken away from the world,
[4189.37s -> 4192.12s]  they are destroyed.
[4192.12s -> 4194.12s]  So therefore, all of us,
[4194.12s -> 4196.12s]  at some point during our lives,
[4196.12s -> 4198.12s]  witness creation and destruction
[4198.12s -> 4202.33s]  in one life.
[4202.33s -> 4205.34s]  It's crazy to think about that.
[4205.34s -> 4207.34s]  And also, like, in the fact that...
[4207.34s -> 4209.34s]  Are we even real?
[4209.34s -> 4211.90s]  Is this a simulation?
[4211.90s -> 4213.90s]  Like, this is a simulation.
[4213.90s -> 4215.90s]  But is this a simulation inside of a simulation?
[4215.90s -> 4218.58s]  Could we in fact
[4218.58s -> 4220.58s]  wake up from this simulation
[4220.58s -> 4223.27s]  into another simulation?
[4223.27s -> 4228.46s]  Because we're doing it now!
[4228.46s -> 4654.17s]  Oh.
[4654.17s -> 4663.18s]  Have I eaten? When was the last time I ate?
[4663.18s -> 4666.94s]  I don't know. Fuck it.
[4666.94s -> 4673.06s]  I'm not ready.
[4673.06s -> 4679.00s]  I don't know.
[4679.00s -> 4683.93s]  I'm hungry as shit.
[4683.93s -> 4685.93s]  This is not a bad couch. Where did I get this from?
[4685.93s -> 4688.36s]  Oh, that's right.
[4688.36s -> 4692.01s]  Cool. Okay.
[4692.01s -> 4697.30s]  Oh. This isn't really good.
[4697.30s -> 4699.30s]  Unbranded beer.
[4699.30s -> 4711.90s]  I'm hungry.
[4711.90s -> 4713.90s]  I feel like I've got, like, a stomach ache, too. I don't know why.
[4713.90s -> 4722.41s]  When was the last time I ate?
[4738.81s -> 4741.50s]  What is it? Mystery?
[4741.50s -> 4744.49s]  Mystery box? Ow.
[4744.49s -> 4746.49s]  A mystery? Please handle with care.
[4746.49s -> 4748.49s]  Do not drop.
[4748.49s -> 4751.75s]  Something fragile in here?
[4751.75s -> 4756.04s]  Well, if it's fragile,
[4756.04s -> 4758.79s]  I don't want to mess with it.
[4758.79s -> 4760.79s]  This is pretty cool, though.
[4760.79s -> 4762.79s]  I would assume my fun meter is high!
[4762.79s -> 4773.40s]  These fucking stools.
[4773.40s -> 4777.75s]  Is there anything else in here?
[4777.75s -> 4779.75s]  There's a lot of paper in here.
[4779.75s -> 4781.75s]  But there...
[4781.75s -> 4785.27s]  Oh, this is a lot.
[4785.27s -> 4787.27s]  You know, can I say something real quick?
[4787.27s -> 4789.27s]  Real quick.
[4789.27s -> 4791.70s]  The amount of packing material
[4791.70s -> 4793.70s]  that people put into boxes
[4793.70s -> 4795.70s]  is getting a little ridiculous, okay?
[4795.70s -> 4797.70s]  I have ordered CDs before
[4797.70s -> 4799.70s]  that have come in a box
[4799.70s -> 4801.70s]  this big
[4801.70s -> 4803.70s]  that have this much packing material
[4803.70s -> 4805.70s]  and then what am I as the
[4805.70s -> 4811.27s]  consumer to do about it?
[4811.27s -> 4813.27s]  You can literally, like, throw a fucking CD
[4813.27s -> 4815.27s]  into the wall and it's gonna be fine.
[4815.27s -> 4817.27s]  You don't have to put, like, 600 fucking pounds
[4817.27s -> 4819.27s]  of paper in here.
[4819.27s -> 4832.12s]  Hold on.
[4832.12s -> 4835.69s]  Stool!
[4835.69s -> 4856.94s]  Cereal. I'll take some cereal.
[4856.94s -> 4865.13s]  That sounds good to me.
[4865.13s -> 4872.49s]  I'm not cutting a tomato.
[4872.49s -> 4874.49s]  That's me pouring a soda.
[4874.49s -> 4877.24s]  Oh, this is
[4877.24s -> 4880.12s]  liquid cereal.
[4880.12s -> 4882.55s]  Do I have any utensils?
[4882.55s -> 4884.55s]  Oh, I'm starving, though.
[4884.55s -> 4894.09s]  Thank goodness.
[4894.09s -> 4897.67s]  What was that?
[4897.67s -> 4900.10s]  I have a good thing I've eaten.
[4900.10s -> 4926.78s]  Real quick.
[4926.78s -> 4929.34s]  Hello. Uncle Ted is dead.
[4929.34s -> 4933.24s]  Is this from the insurance company?
[4933.24s -> 4936.44s]  What? Didn't Uncle Ted die, like,
[4936.44s -> 4939.70s]  three days ago? Two days ago?
[4939.70s -> 4943.29s]  What do you mean? My mother called me and said
[4943.29s -> 4947.13s]  I got $2,000
[4947.13s -> 4950.39s]  added to my account.
[4950.39s -> 4952.39s]  But I thought that, I thought, what, is this, like, just litigation
[4952.39s -> 4954.39s]  stuff? Like, I got it, like, a week,
[4954.39s -> 4957.46s]  two, three weeks later or something?
[4957.46s -> 4959.46s]  No, he's confirmed dead yesterday.
[4959.46s -> 4965.02s]  Oh. Okay.
[4965.02s -> 4967.51s]  Interesting. Thank you for the, uh,
[4967.51s -> 4969.51s]  thank you for the reply and thank you for the, thanks for the email.
[4969.51s -> 4975.26s]  What?
[4975.26s -> 4977.26s]  I was in smack-a-roos, though. I'll take that one.
[4977.26s -> 4981.03s]  Is he dead? What?
[4981.03s -> 4984.23s]  I thought he died.
[4984.23s -> 4986.23s]  Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you.
[4986.23s -> 4990.84s]  The cereal's actually pretty good.
[4990.84s -> 4998.78s]  Close to the door. No, I don't
[4998.78s -> 5000.78s]  eat on site. This is the only food that they give me.
[5000.78s -> 5011.02s]  Okay, can I sell this
[5011.02s -> 5018.38s]  watch?
[5018.38s -> 5028.81s]  I don't want to leave trash around. That's better.
[5028.81s -> 5031.82s]  I need to put a trash barrel. Put a trash can
[5031.82s -> 5034.18s]  in there. Why are the people
[5034.18s -> 5036.81s]  just at my house?
[5036.81s -> 5038.81s]  Stop coming to my house.
[5038.81s -> 5042.14s]  I haven't eaten breakfast.
[5042.14s -> 5047.45s]  Oh, my God. All right. Who is that?
[5047.45s -> 5053.85s]  Hi.
[5053.85s -> 5055.85s]  I'm Edna, by the way, your neighbor.
[5055.85s -> 5060.33s]  What are you doing here? You'll have to
[5060.33s -> 5062.33s]  forgive me. I was busy
[5062.33s -> 5064.33s]  with my cat sweater yesterday,
[5064.33s -> 5066.33s]  but this is for you.
[5066.33s -> 5068.33s]  Welcome to the neighborhood.
[5068.33s -> 5070.33s]  Thank you. Welcome to the neighborhood.
[5070.33s -> 5072.33s]  Let's see the house.
[5072.33s -> 5074.50s]  Oh, my.
[5074.50s -> 5076.50s]  Oh, wow.
[5076.50s -> 5078.50s]  You've really done nothing with the place.
[5078.50s -> 5080.50s]  Okay.
[5080.50s -> 5082.50s]  Is this what you kids
[5082.50s -> 5084.50s]  call a house these days?
[5084.50s -> 5086.50s]  Thank you.
[5086.50s -> 5088.50s]  Is this a basket?
[5088.50s -> 5090.50s]  I'll take that back later, but you put
[5090.50s -> 5092.50s]  that wherever you'd like. That's for you.
[5092.50s -> 5094.50s]  There are apples. There's fresh fruit in here.
[5094.50s -> 5096.50s]  Yes, that's from the farmers
[5096.50s -> 5098.50s]  market. It's a stone's throw away.
[5098.50s -> 5100.50s]  If you ever get hungry,
[5100.50s -> 5102.50s]  you can go down there.
[5102.50s -> 5104.50s]  There's no worms.
[5104.50s -> 5106.50s]  It's a very big mix. My cat is the
[5106.50s -> 5108.50s]  one with worms, but there's no worms
[5108.50s -> 5110.50s]  in the apples. I can't have any of these.
[5110.50s -> 5112.50s]  No, those are for you.
[5112.50s -> 5114.50s]  But you're taking the basket.
[5114.50s -> 5116.50s]  Yes, it's my basket.
[5116.50s -> 5118.50s]  My first grandchild
[5118.50s -> 5120.50s]  was born, and we brought it home
[5120.50s -> 5122.50s]  in that basket.
[5122.50s -> 5124.50s]  That's really fantastic.
[5124.50s -> 5126.50s]  What's your name again?
[5126.50s -> 5128.50s]  Edna. What is this?
[5130.50s -> 5132.50s]  The placement's a little odd, but
[5132.50s -> 5134.50s]  you can sit down if you want to. In your kitchen.
[5134.50s -> 5136.50s]  I just moved in.
[5136.50s -> 5138.50s]  It was really nice to see you, though.
[5138.50s -> 5140.50s]  Have you seen these spoons?
[5140.50s -> 5142.50s]  Yes, I have seen those spoons.
[5142.50s -> 5144.50s]  My Uncle Ted left me those spoons.
[5144.50s -> 5146.50s]  Did they come with your uncle who?
[5146.50s -> 5148.50s]  My Uncle Ted left me those spoons.
[5148.50s -> 5150.50s]  You wet the bed? Okay.
[5150.50s -> 5152.50s]  That happens sometimes.
[5152.50s -> 5154.50s]  People wet the bed. It's perfectly normal.
[5154.50s -> 5156.50s]  Don't worry about that.
[5156.50s -> 5158.50s]  Yeah, sometimes they do.
[5158.50s -> 5160.50s]  They're under the age of six.
[5160.50s -> 5162.50s]  I'm a 35-year-old man.
[5162.50s -> 5164.50s]  How old are you?
[5164.50s -> 5166.50s]  I'm 35.
[5166.50s -> 5168.50s]  Okay, you look more like a 15
[5168.50s -> 5170.50s]  with those gloves, but that's
[5170.50s -> 5172.50s]  all right.
[5172.50s -> 5174.50s]  Do you mind if I sit down?
[5174.50s -> 5180.25s]  Please do, please.
[5180.25s -> 5182.25s]  No.
[5182.25s -> 5184.25s]  Oh, my.
[5184.25s -> 5186.25s]  I just have a bad migraine.
[5186.25s -> 5189.06s]  I'm okay.
[5189.06s -> 5191.06s]  You look lovely.
[5191.06s -> 5193.06s]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[5193.06s -> 5195.06s]  I do my own makeup and my own hair.
[5195.06s -> 5197.06s]  I've never seen in my life.
[5197.06s -> 5199.06s]  Well, sweetheart, I'm sorry, but
[5199.06s -> 5201.06s]  I'm taken.
[5201.06s -> 5203.06s]  I've been married for 45 years.
[5203.06s -> 5205.06s]  That's excellent.
[5205.06s -> 5207.06s]  Do you have
[5207.06s -> 5209.06s]  a stool by chance
[5209.06s -> 5211.06s]  for me to put my feet up?
[5211.06s -> 5213.06s]  No, not yet.
[5213.06s -> 5215.06s]  It's kind of an interesting scenario that I have here
[5215.06s -> 5217.06s]  in this particular house.
[5217.06s -> 5219.06s]  I mean, you can put your feet up there if you want.
[5219.06s -> 5221.06s]  It's too high. The blood flow.
[5221.06s -> 5223.06s]  It's too high.
[5223.06s -> 5225.06s]  How old are you?
[5225.06s -> 5227.06s]  You shouldn't ask
[5227.06s -> 5229.06s]  a lady that question.
[5229.06s -> 5231.06s]  That's probably a bad idea.
[5231.06s -> 5233.06s]  You ruined it.
[5233.06s -> 5235.69s]  Do you have food?
[5235.69s -> 5237.69s]  I do. I actually do have food.
[5237.69s -> 5239.69s]  Do you have bread?
[5239.69s -> 5241.69s]  I got lots of bread. Do you like bread?
[5241.69s -> 5243.69s]  Not really, no.
[5243.69s -> 5245.69s]  I don't like bread, but
[5245.69s -> 5247.69s]  a house isn't really a home without food.
[5250.06s -> 5252.06s]  I've got bread. I mean, I do live
[5252.06s -> 5254.06s]  like a 20-year-old that's in a dorm room,
[5254.06s -> 5256.06s]  but I have peanut butter, I have cereal,
[5256.06s -> 5258.06s]  I have mac and cheese, I've got bread.
[5258.06s -> 5260.06s]  Oh, sweetheart. Why don't we
[5260.06s -> 5262.06s]  whip something up really quick?
[5262.06s -> 5264.06s]  Maybe in a few days or something.
[5264.06s -> 5266.06s]  No, right now. Why don't you
[5266.06s -> 5268.06s]  be a doll?
[5268.06s -> 5270.06s]  I've got some stuff going on, but I'm not sure.
[5270.06s -> 5272.06s]  I'm sorry, that might be me.
[5272.06s -> 5274.06s]  That's you.
[5274.06s -> 5276.06s]  Don't worry about that. Hold on.
[5276.06s -> 5278.06s]  I have a lot of nice people who call me.
[5278.06s -> 5280.23s]  Okay, yeah.
[5280.23s -> 5282.23s]  I can get some food ready if you want.
[5282.23s -> 5284.92s]  I've got peanut butter, you know, I've got everything.
[5284.92s -> 5287.42s]  Hello, this is Edna.
[5287.42s -> 5290.04s]  Yes.
[5290.04s -> 5293.18s]  My social security number.
[5293.18s -> 5295.74s]  Okay.
[5295.74s -> 5297.74s]  I can give that to you if you want.
[5297.74s -> 5299.74s]  That's fine.
[5299.74s -> 5301.74s]  What are you doing? Yeah, so my social security number
[5301.74s -> 5303.74s]  No, don't do that. Don't do that.
[5303.74s -> 5305.74s]  Wait, wait, wait. Is that a family member?
[5305.74s -> 5307.74s]  Is that a family member?
[5307.74s -> 5309.74s]  My family wants to talk to you.
[5309.74s -> 5311.74s]  Is that a family member? Oh, no, no.
[5311.74s -> 5313.74s]  He's from the social security department.
[5313.74s -> 5315.74s]  He's from the social security department?
[5315.74s -> 5317.74s]  Yeah, yeah. Are you a family member?
[5317.74s -> 5320.87s]  Did he hang up on you?
[5320.87s -> 5322.87s]  They hung up. He'll call back.
[5322.87s -> 5324.87s]  He's a real sweet guy. Was that like a son
[5324.87s -> 5326.87s]  or a grandson?
[5326.87s -> 5328.87s]  No, there's a little bit of a mix-up.
[5328.87s -> 5330.87s]  I left my car on the south border
[5330.87s -> 5332.87s]  of Texas, but it's a whole
[5332.87s -> 5334.87s]  thing. Don't worry about it.
[5334.87s -> 5336.87s]  I wouldn't give your social security number
[5336.87s -> 5338.87s]  to people you don't know.
[5338.87s -> 5340.87s]  Will you be a sweetheart and get me some
[5340.87s -> 5342.87s]  flour and sugar and eggs and some
[5342.87s -> 5344.87s]  mayonnaise and maybe an avocado
[5344.87s -> 5346.87s]  and a couple of, I don't know, do you have
[5346.87s -> 5348.87s]  like a baking sheet or maybe a
[5348.87s -> 5350.87s]  pie tin?
[5350.87s -> 5352.87s]  I don't think I have any of those things.
[5352.87s -> 5354.87s]  You don't have any of those things? I mean, you can take a look.
[5354.87s -> 5357.11s]  Okay.
[5357.11s -> 5359.11s]  Just to make yourself comfortable and maybe we could plan this
[5359.11s -> 5361.11s]  maybe like in a few days, but not right now.
[5361.11s -> 5363.11s]  Oh, no, I'm busy in a few days.
[5363.11s -> 5366.31s]  Okay.
[5366.31s -> 5368.55s]  There's not much here,
[5368.55s -> 5370.55s]  but. What am I doing?
[5370.55s -> 5373.69s]  All right.
[5373.69s -> 5375.69s]  What, he only eats macaroni?
[5375.69s -> 5379.72s]  Is that you
[5379.72s -> 5381.72s]  or me? I don't know. It sounds like you.
[5381.72s -> 5383.72s]  I think it's me again. I need to make a phone call.
[5383.72s -> 5385.72s]  Are you getting another call?
[5385.72s -> 5387.72s]  How many calls do you get? It's me. It's me.
[5387.72s -> 5389.72s]  Well, I'm a very busy woman now, right?
[5389.72s -> 5392.22s]  I would change your phone number.
[5392.22s -> 5394.90s]  Hello? Yes.
[5394.90s -> 5396.90s]  I was telling you
[5396.90s -> 5398.90s]  the social security number, right?
[5398.90s -> 5400.90s]  Yeah. It's
[5400.90s -> 5403.34s]  I'm sorry. What was that?
[5403.34s -> 5405.34s]  Where is my grandson?
[5405.34s -> 5408.22s]  He's in prison.
[5408.22s -> 5410.22s]  I want to get more physically fit.
[5410.22s -> 5412.22s]  I'm quite busy right now.
[5412.22s -> 5414.22s]  Some leg routines, something like that.
[5414.22s -> 5416.22s]  He's in prison? Yeah.
[5416.22s -> 5418.22s]  Whatever you cost, it doesn't matter because it's not me paying for it
[5418.22s -> 5420.22s]  except that it is just bullshit.
[5420.22s -> 5422.22s]  How long has he been in prison for?
[5422.22s -> 5424.22s]  Okay.
[5424.22s -> 5426.22s]  What do you need from me?
[5426.22s -> 5428.22s]  It's 985. 985 Dollhouse Way.
[5428.22s -> 5430.22s]  Is everything okay?
[5430.22s -> 5432.39s]  Excellent. We'll see you soon.
[5432.39s -> 5434.57s]  Okay.
[5434.57s -> 5436.57s]  Well, how much money is it exactly?
[5436.57s -> 5438.57s]  How much money would you need from me?
[5438.57s -> 5440.57s]  Okay, so $10,000
[5440.57s -> 5442.57s]  and he gets out of prison. Scott?
[5442.57s -> 5444.57s]  Hang the phone up.
[5444.57s -> 5446.57s]  It's two seconds. Two seconds.
[5446.57s -> 5448.57s]  Okay, my wire details.
[5448.57s -> 5450.57s]  It's a Wells Fargo
[5450.57s -> 5452.57s]  or a Chase or whatever.
[5452.57s -> 5456.58s]  Hello!
[5456.58s -> 5458.58s]  It's time to get
[5458.58s -> 5460.58s]  fit.
[5460.58s -> 5462.58s]  Those look heavy. Come on in.
[5462.58s -> 5464.58s]  Get in there and get physical.
[5464.58s -> 5466.58s]  Oh, thank you.
[5466.58s -> 5468.58s]  Alright.
[5468.58s -> 5470.58s]  Upper body?
[5470.58s -> 5472.58s]  Well, I can tell you how we're going to get you in shape.
[5472.58s -> 5474.58s]  Excuse me.
[5474.58s -> 5476.58s]  I'm so sorry.
[5476.58s -> 5478.58s]  I'll have to call you back.
[5478.58s -> 5480.58s]  There's a strange man in the house.
[5480.58s -> 5482.58s]  Sometimes,
[5482.58s -> 5484.58s]  my phone calls are most effective.
[5484.58s -> 5486.58s]  Yes, they are. Hold on a second.
[5486.58s -> 5488.58s]  Don't take any more phone calls.
[5488.58s -> 5490.58s]  Well, I would get your phone number.
[5490.58s -> 5492.58s]  Go to your store and have your provider
[5492.58s -> 5494.58s]  and they talk to them about that.
[5494.58s -> 5496.58s]  I think you probably shouldn't be answering those calls.
[5496.58s -> 5498.58s]  What was your name? Gigi.
[5498.58s -> 5500.58s]  This is Gigi.
[5500.58s -> 5502.58s]  Nice to meet you.
[5502.58s -> 5504.58s]  So what are we going to do?
[5504.58s -> 5506.58s]  Some light aerobic exercise.
[5506.58s -> 5508.58s]  You can sit down.
[5508.58s -> 5510.58s]  I think I'll sit down for this one.
[5510.58s -> 5512.58s]  I want you to follow me.
[5512.58s -> 5514.58s]  Couple of moves. First one.
[5514.58s -> 5516.58s]  This sprinkler.
[5516.58s -> 5518.58s]  Okay.
[5518.58s -> 5520.58s]  Hey.
[5522.58s -> 5524.58s]  Hey.
[5524.58s -> 5526.58s]  That's more movement. More energy.
[5526.58s -> 5528.58s]  Come on. But it hurts.
[5528.58s -> 5530.58s]  I can do this at home.
[5530.58s -> 5532.58s]  We're picking items at the supermarket.
[5532.58s -> 5534.58s]  We're picking
[5534.58s -> 5536.58s]  items. Come on. Get that arm up.
[5536.58s -> 5538.58s]  We're picking items at the supermarket.
[5538.58s -> 5540.58s]  We're picking items at the supermarket.
[5540.58s -> 5542.58s]  We're swimming in the pool.
[5542.58s -> 5544.58s]  We're swimming in the pool.
[5544.58s -> 5546.58s]  Are you feeling strong?
[5546.58s -> 5548.58s]  You look strong. Do you feel good?
[5548.58s -> 5550.58s]  Don't do those. I don't want to be
[5550.58s -> 5552.58s]  responsible if something happens to you.
[5552.58s -> 5554.58s]  I don't want to be responsible if something happens to you.
[5554.58s -> 5556.58s]  Just relax and don't take any more phone calls.
[5556.58s -> 5558.58s]  How do you feel?
[5558.58s -> 5560.58s]  I'm lightening up a little bit.
[5560.58s -> 5562.58s]  How much are these? How much weight are these?
[5562.58s -> 5564.58s]  Those are five pounds each.
[5564.58s -> 5566.58s]  Careful now. You don't want to hurt yourself.
[5566.58s -> 5568.58s]  We're yummy mummies
[5568.58s -> 5570.58s]  looking to be tight in the tummies.
[5570.58s -> 5572.58s]  You got it.
[5572.58s -> 5574.58s]  Those are like 60. You might need a sparr.
[5574.58s -> 5576.58s]  But you're looking good.
[5576.58s -> 5578.58s]  I wanted to drop those off. It's a welcoming
[5578.58s -> 5580.58s]  gift for you. Thank you.
[5580.58s -> 5582.58s]  You look great. Thank you. It actually feels
[5582.58s -> 5584.58s]  pretty good. You ever want to go out for like a 60
[5584.58s -> 5586.58s]  mile run? You just let me know, okay? Never.
[5586.58s -> 5588.58s]  You'll never get that phone call. Alright, I'll come back
[5588.58s -> 5590.58s]  tomorrow morning. Excellent. So are you going to leave these here?
[5590.58s -> 5592.58s]  Well, would you like them? I would
[5592.58s -> 5594.58s]  love these. That would be fantastic.
[5594.58s -> 5596.58s]  They're so sweet of you.
[5596.58s -> 5598.58s]  How much was that?
[5598.58s -> 5600.58s]  Do you need a credit card? No, that's okay.
[5600.58s -> 5602.58s]  Listen, we're coming back for a workout tomorrow.
[5602.58s -> 5604.58s]  Alright.
[5604.58s -> 5606.58s]  Get out of here.
[5606.58s -> 5608.58s]  Okay, bye.
[5608.58s -> 5610.58s]  That was a very strong workout.
[5612.58s -> 5614.58s]  That cost $200.
[5614.58s -> 5616.58s]  So what was your name?
[5616.58s -> 5619.08s]  What was your name again?
[5619.08s -> 5621.08s]  My name is Jirba.
[5621.08s -> 5623.08s]  And you have children? I don't have
[5623.08s -> 5625.77s]  kids. Why?
[5625.77s -> 5627.77s]  Why don't you have children? It just didn't work
[5627.77s -> 5629.77s]  out. I've just been trying to focus on my career.
[5629.77s -> 5631.77s]  Okay, and what's that? You have a job?
[5631.77s -> 5633.77s]  Yeah. Most of your kids don't have jobs
[5633.77s -> 5635.77s]  these days. You go to work regularly?
[5635.77s -> 5637.77s]  I don't get in a car
[5637.77s -> 5639.77s]  to go to work, but I go in front of a screen.
[5639.77s -> 5641.77s]  Alright, very interesting.
[5641.77s -> 5643.77s]  I'm sorry, what was that? I get
[5643.77s -> 5645.77s]  in front of a screen. It's almost like a car. Like I have like a mouse
[5645.77s -> 5647.77s]  and keyboard and I sit in front of a computer.
[5647.77s -> 5649.77s]  What does that mean? That sounds like you made up
[5649.77s -> 5651.77s]  a job. No,
[5651.77s -> 5653.77s]  I get in front of a computer and I talk
[5653.77s -> 5655.77s]  and I hang out with people and I chat with them and it's like we chat
[5655.77s -> 5657.77s]  and we're cool and everything's cool.
[5657.77s -> 5659.77s]  You don't have to make up a job to appease
[5659.77s -> 5661.77s]  me, sweetheart. I still
[5661.77s -> 5663.77s]  also care about you. And I'm a plumber.
[5663.77s -> 5665.77s]  Oh, see the trades
[5665.77s -> 5667.77s]  are a very beautiful job. Yeah, that's very
[5667.77s -> 5669.77s]  difficult. That's exactly what people need
[5669.77s -> 5671.77s]  in today's world. It's
[5671.77s -> 5673.77s]  plumbing, I go into the sinks.
[5673.77s -> 5675.77s]  Well, I tell you what, I'd like
[5675.77s -> 5677.77s]  you to, really quickly if you
[5677.77s -> 5679.77s]  don't mind, could you point me
[5679.77s -> 5681.77s]  to your bathroom? The bathroom's right in the
[5681.77s -> 5683.77s]  storage over here. Okay, I have a weak bladder
[5683.77s -> 5685.77s]  so just give me two. Well, so do I, but
[5685.77s -> 5687.77s]  apparently they don't want to take care of it. Oh, that's not bad
[5687.77s -> 5689.77s]  at your age.
[5689.77s -> 5691.77s]  Alright, she was talking about getting flour.
[5691.77s -> 5693.77s]  Yes, flour,
[5693.77s -> 5695.77s]  a whole package of eggs,
[5695.77s -> 5697.77s]  avocado, if you have
[5697.77s -> 5699.77s]  anything like noodles, salami,
[5699.77s -> 5701.77s]  anything like that.
[5701.77s -> 5703.77s]  Excuse me.
[5710.86s -> 5714.95s]  Oh my. Look, he's just like Jimmy Fallon.
[5714.95s -> 5716.95s]  He just like breaks it every time.
[5716.95s -> 5721.30s]  Oh, a stool.
[5721.30s -> 5723.54s]  Okay.
[5723.54s -> 5725.54s]  I need to get the flour ready.
[5725.54s -> 5727.54s]  And
[5727.54s -> 5730.86s]  I need to
[5730.86s -> 5732.86s]  get flour.
[5732.86s -> 5734.86s]  And
[5734.86s -> 5741.13s]  Okay.
[5741.13s -> 5743.13s]  Easy does it.
[5743.13s -> 5745.62s]  I'm a little
[5745.62s -> 5747.62s]  deeper.
[5747.62s -> 5749.62s]  Edna, are you in there?
[5749.62s -> 5751.62s]  What was that?
[5751.62s -> 5753.62s]  Would you like to dance,
[5753.62s -> 5755.62s]  Edna? It's a weird request,
[5755.62s -> 5757.62s]  but would you like to dance?
[5757.62s -> 5759.62s]  Okay, hold on.
[5759.62s -> 5761.62s]  Edna, come on, if you want to come on out here.
[5761.62s -> 5768.54s]  Would you like to dance?
[5768.54s -> 5770.54s]  Would you like to dance?
[5770.54s -> 5772.54s]  Would you love to dance?
[5772.54s -> 5774.54s]  Okay, let's go ahead and do this.
[5774.54s -> 5776.54s]  Okay, I don't know what that means.
[5776.54s -> 5782.36s]  My throat was a little weird.
[5782.36s -> 5784.36s]  You remind me of my husband
[5784.36s -> 5786.36s]  when he was younger,
[5786.36s -> 5790.07s]  before he passed away.
[5790.07s -> 5795.70s]  Yeah, you spin me around.
[5795.70s -> 5797.70s]  Just like
[5797.70s -> 5799.70s]  Thank you.
[5799.70s -> 5801.70s]  We lock it in our locket fingers.
[5801.70s -> 5804.52s]  Why are we dancing for?
[5804.52s -> 5807.14s]  Because I'm very tired.
[5807.14s -> 5814.76s]  Please let go.
[5814.76s -> 5816.76s]  I'm trying to let go.
[5816.76s -> 5818.76s]  Okay.
[5818.76s -> 5821.06s]  Into the kitchen, if you would.
[5821.06s -> 5823.06s]  Into the kitchen.
[5823.06s -> 5831.96s]  Are you coming in here?
[5831.96s -> 5833.96s]  I'm coming in here.
[5833.96s -> 5835.96s]  Listen, I'm a firm believer
[5835.96s -> 5837.96s]  that a house isn't a home without cookies.
[5837.96s -> 5839.96s]  Yeah.
[5839.96s -> 5841.96s]  Can I give you
[5841.96s -> 5843.96s]  my mother's famous recipe for cookies?
[5843.96s -> 5845.96s]  Edna, did you wash your hands?
[5845.96s -> 5847.96s]  I never wash my hands.
[5847.96s -> 5849.96s]  You kids don't understand. I have a very good immune system.
[5849.96s -> 5853.35s]  Very good.
[5853.35s -> 5855.35s]  Okay.
[5855.35s -> 5857.35s]  No, that's okay.
[5857.35s -> 5859.35s]  If we're going to make food, then you should...
[5859.35s -> 5861.35s]  You'll do all the work, sweetie.
[5861.35s -> 5863.35s]  It's all in the feeling. You have to feel this.
[5863.35s -> 5865.35s]  Okay, flour, sugar, eggs.
[5865.35s -> 5867.35s]  What are we making?
[5867.35s -> 5869.35s]  Cookies.
[5869.35s -> 5871.35s]  What kind of cookies?
[5871.35s -> 5873.35s]  Water.
[5873.35s -> 5875.35s]  Eggs are in there, if you want to grab them.
[5875.35s -> 5877.35s]  What kind of eggs are these?
[5877.35s -> 5879.35s]  Those are free-range eggs.
[5879.35s -> 5881.35s]  What does free-range mean?
[5881.35s -> 5883.35s]  I don't know, I just pretend to know.
[5883.35s -> 5885.35s]  Okay.
[5885.35s -> 5887.35s]  I think that means the chickens are going to walk around.
[5887.35s -> 5889.35s]  Okay, we'll need all of these.
[5889.35s -> 5891.35s]  Is that all right?
[5891.35s -> 5893.35s]  All of them?
[5893.35s -> 5895.35s]  At least most of them, yeah.
[5895.35s -> 5897.35s]  We can use a few of them.
[5897.35s -> 5899.35s]  How much sugar?
[5899.35s -> 5901.35s]  Okay, sprinkle it all in there.
[5901.35s -> 5903.35s]  This is to make cookie dough?
[5903.35s -> 5905.35s]  Yes, go ahead. Just give it a couple of good shakes.
[5905.35s -> 5907.35s]  Put it all in there.
[5907.35s -> 5909.35s]  All the flour?
[5909.35s -> 5911.35s]  Well, I mean most of it.
[5911.35s -> 5913.35s]  That's good.
[5913.35s -> 5915.35s]  A little more.
[5915.35s -> 5917.35s]  A little bit more.
[5917.35s -> 5919.35s]  Okay, eyeball it. Does that seem good?
[5919.35s -> 5921.35s]  I've never made cookies in my entire life.
[5921.35s -> 5923.35s]  You've never made cookies?
[5923.35s -> 5925.35s]  That looks great.
[5925.35s -> 5927.35s]  You want to wiggle it around a little, see if there's any lumps in there.
[5927.35s -> 5929.35s]  You're fine.
[5929.35s -> 5931.35s]  I don't see any.
[5931.35s -> 5933.35s]  Okay, now dump all the sugar in it. People like sugar.
[5933.35s -> 5936.62s]  I like sugar, it's good.
[5936.62s -> 5938.62s]  And this is just how my mother used to make these.
[5938.62s -> 5940.62s]  They're very simple.
[5940.62s -> 5942.62s]  I have these Mickey Mouse gloves on, it's kind of hard to open.
[5942.62s -> 5944.62s]  I don't know why you kids do things like that.
[5944.62s -> 5946.62s]  It's just like...
[5946.62s -> 5948.62s]  Where did you get these spoons, by the way?
[5948.62s -> 5950.62s]  Those were left by my uncle Ted.
[5950.62s -> 5952.62s]  Okay.
[5952.62s -> 5954.62s]  Who recently passed away.
[5954.62s -> 5956.62s]  Can I have them?
[5956.62s -> 5958.62s]  That smells so bad.
[5958.62s -> 5960.62s]  Can I have those spoons?
[5960.62s -> 5962.62s]  Can you have them?
[5962.62s -> 5964.62s]  Yeah, I mean, you don't use them, right? Obviously.
[5964.62s -> 5966.62s]  Well, I mean, they were left from my uncle Ted,
[5966.62s -> 5968.62s]  who recently passed away, so I don't think that's appropriate.
[5968.62s -> 5970.62s]  You need help with that, or you got it?
[5970.62s -> 5972.62s]  I'm just going to open the top, because I have these Mickey Mouse gloves on,
[5972.62s -> 5974.62s]  because somebody decided I was going to put Mickey Mouse gloves on
[5974.62s -> 5976.62s]  and wear them the entire day.
[5976.62s -> 5978.62s]  Well, you're your own person, you get to make your own choices.
[5978.62s -> 5980.62s]  How much sugar goes in here, Edna?
[5980.62s -> 5982.62s]  The whole thing.
[5982.62s -> 5987.48s]  The whole thing goes right in there.
[5987.48s -> 5989.48s]  Perfect, that's perfect.
[5989.48s -> 5991.48s]  Okay, so that looks good?
[5991.48s -> 5993.48s]  Okay, yeah, now what I want you to do is I want you to crack
[5993.48s -> 5995.48s]  two or three eggs into that pitcher.
[5995.48s -> 5997.48s]  Okay. Two or three of them?
[5997.48s -> 5999.48s]  Two or three.
[5999.48s -> 6001.48s]  Whatever you're feeling today, do you want to be extra moist cookies?
[6001.48s -> 6003.48s]  Is there a recipe, or are you just doing this?
[6003.48s -> 6005.48s]  No, it's all in your heart, honey.
[6005.48s -> 6007.48s]  But is it...
[6007.48s -> 6009.48s]  I don't know what that means, Edna.
[6009.48s -> 6011.48s]  How many eggs do you think would be best?
[6011.48s -> 6013.48s]  If you're always on a quiz show, and you told me how many eggs,
[6013.48s -> 6015.48s]  I would say probably like four.
[6015.48s -> 6017.48s]  Then put four eggs in, and if it's terrible,
[6017.48s -> 6019.48s]  we'll make it again, that's fine.
[6023.43s -> 6025.43s]  Honey, oh, you've got to do better than that.
[6030.63s -> 6032.63s]  We've made a good decision here, that's for sure.
[6032.63s -> 6036.02s]  Oh, these gloves are coming off!
[6036.02s -> 6038.02s]  Hey, Edna, how about two?
[6038.02s -> 6040.02s]  Yeah, you know what, I think it'll be great with...
[6040.02s -> 6042.02s]  Even one egg is perfect.
[6042.02s -> 6044.02s]  You know, back in the war, when I was younger,
[6044.02s -> 6046.02s]  we used to have to ration,
[6046.02s -> 6048.02s]  and we could make one egg go a long way.
[6048.02s -> 6050.02s]  You know what, in the gift basket,
[6050.02s -> 6052.02s]  I brought over some applesauce.
[6052.02s -> 6054.02s]  Applesauce?
[6054.02s -> 6056.02s]  This is applesauce.
[6056.02s -> 6058.02s]  Edna, these are mint chocolates.
[6058.02s -> 6060.02s]  Well, if you boil them up,
[6060.02s -> 6062.02s]  it'll be a similar consistency.
[6062.02s -> 6064.02s]  I mean, we'll roll with it.
[6064.02s -> 6066.02s]  We'll roll with it.
[6066.02s -> 6068.02s]  Okay, so boil these...
[6068.02s -> 6070.02s]  No, forget it, okay, take this.
[6070.02s -> 6072.02s]  Here, you're fine, you're fine.
[6072.02s -> 6074.02s]  Okay, well, I need a stirrer.
[6074.02s -> 6076.02s]  Do you have water?
[6076.02s -> 6078.02s]  I do have water, it's right here.
[6078.02s -> 6080.02s]  Take a little bit of water.
[6080.02s -> 6082.02s]  It's fine.
[6082.02s -> 6084.02s]  So what is this going to make, Edna?
[6084.02s -> 6086.02s]  They used to say two spoons of sugar
[6086.02s -> 6088.02s]  would make the medicine go down.
[6088.02s -> 6090.02s]  In this case, you have a whole box.
[6090.02s -> 6092.02s]  So it'll taste very good.
[6092.02s -> 6094.02s]  That smell you're smelling, by the way,
[6094.02s -> 6096.02s]  is probably the eggs and the sugar combined.
[6096.02s -> 6098.02s]  It's probably filling the room.
[6098.02s -> 6100.02s]  I can't smell anything.
[6100.02s -> 6102.02s]  Thank God.
[6102.02s -> 6104.52s]  So how much water, just a little bit of water?
[6104.52s -> 6106.52s]  Okay.
[6106.52s -> 6108.52s]  Do I mix this?
[6108.52s -> 6110.52s]  What kind of cookies?
[6110.52s -> 6112.52s]  Really put your arms back into it.
[6112.52s -> 6114.52s]  No, like really work.
[6114.52s -> 6116.70s]  I want to see you actually working.
[6116.70s -> 6118.70s]  Okay.
[6118.70s -> 6120.70s]  It's good for you kids to work.
[6120.70s -> 6122.70s]  You've got elbow grease, we used to call it.
[6122.70s -> 6124.70s]  And this is sugar flour and egg,
[6124.70s -> 6126.70s]  and it's going to make...
[6126.70s -> 6128.70s]  Pecan sandies.
[6128.70s -> 6130.70s]  My mother's recipe.
[6130.70s -> 6132.70s]  Those are actually my least favorite cookie in the world.
[6132.70s -> 6134.70s]  Say that.
[6134.70s -> 6136.70s]  Because when you bite into them, it tastes like you're taking a bite of the beach on the ground
[6136.70s -> 6138.70s]  and it's like sandy, and it feels like gritty.
[6138.70s -> 6140.70s]  So you don't want extra pecans then?
[6140.70s -> 6142.70s]  Edna, when I take a bite out of a pecan sandy,
[6142.70s -> 6144.70s]  I feel like there's sand in my underwear from the beach.
[6144.70s -> 6146.70s]  You don't like that?
[6146.70s -> 6148.70s]  I mean, I don't hate them.
[6148.70s -> 6152.15s]  I thought that's why some people went to the beach.
[6152.15s -> 6154.15s]  I've got it all wrong, I guess.
[6154.15s -> 6156.65s]  Okay.
[6156.65s -> 6159.46s]  Are you really tired after that?
[6159.46s -> 6161.46s]  I mean, it's work, Edna.
[6161.46s -> 6163.46s]  Look at this, look at how much muscle I'm putting into this.
[6163.46s -> 6165.46s]  I just don't understand.
[6165.46s -> 6167.46s]  All right, that's good.
[6167.46s -> 6169.46s]  Is that good? Can we see? Is that good?
[6169.46s -> 6171.46s]  Do you mind for two seconds?
[6171.46s -> 6173.46s]  I have to make a quick phone call if you don't mind.
[6173.46s -> 6175.46s]  No, fine, that's fine.
[6175.46s -> 6177.46s]  You put it in the oven.
[6177.46s -> 6179.46s]  That's an oven-proof bowl, I'm pretty sure.
[6179.46s -> 6181.46s]  Okay.
[6181.46s -> 6183.46s]  Edna, this is plastic.
[6183.46s -> 6185.90s]  Can I actually use your phone?
[6185.90s -> 6187.90s]  Edna, before you go in there, I need to take a shower real quick.
[6187.90s -> 6189.90s]  Oh.
[6189.90s -> 6191.90s]  You can get on the phone.
[6191.90s -> 6193.90s]  Okay, I'll make a quick call.
[6193.90s -> 6195.90s]  I just need to take a quick shower.
[6195.90s -> 6197.90s]  All right, you're fine.
[6197.90s -> 6200.65s]  Let me get these in the oven.
[6200.65s -> 6202.65s]  Is it going to be pecan sandies?
[6202.65s -> 6204.65s]  Yeah, put it in there for like 20 minutes.
[6204.65s -> 6206.65s]  Okay, so 20 minutes.
[6206.65s -> 6208.65s]  Doesn't that seem kind of long?
[6208.65s -> 6210.65s]  Is it okay if the utensil's in there?
[6210.65s -> 6212.65s]  Okay, I'm going to take a shower.
[6212.65s -> 6215.14s]  I'm so sorry, if you smell something, it's not me.
[6215.14s -> 6219.75s]  I'm going to get fucking rid of this lady.
[6219.75s -> 6224.94s]  A neighbor?
[6224.94s -> 6227.93s]  What the fuck?
[6227.93s -> 6229.93s]  She just won't leave.
[6229.93s -> 6231.93s]  There's really nothing in this house.
[6237.62s -> 6252.90s]  So much better.
[6252.90s -> 6255.46s]  I think I'm just going to piss.
[6255.46s -> 6258.15s]  I'm just pissing right now.
[6258.15s -> 6260.15s]  Well, when the water was off, the water's off now.
[6260.15s -> 6262.15s]  I want to pee now.
[6262.15s -> 6264.15s]  Turn the water back on.
[6264.15s -> 6266.15s]  Turn the water back on.
[6266.15s -> 6268.15s]  You don't just pee into an empty shower.
[6268.15s -> 6271.61s]  You pee when your shower's running.
[6271.61s -> 6273.61s]  Everyone does it.
[6273.61s -> 6275.61s]  And you can pretend like you don't.
[6275.61s -> 6278.62s]  I know you do.
[6278.62s -> 6287.50s]  I feel better.
[6287.50s -> 6289.50s]  Sweetie, are you there?
[6289.50s -> 6291.50s]  I would wash my hands, but...
[6291.50s -> 6293.50s]  What was your name again?
[6293.50s -> 6295.50s]  Justin?
[6295.50s -> 6297.50s]  Justin, are you there?
[6297.50s -> 6302.23s]  Justin?
[6302.23s -> 6306.23s]  You don't by chance have nitroglycerin pills or anything, do you?
[6306.23s -> 6308.23s]  I don't.
[6308.23s -> 6310.23s]  What was it?
[6310.23s -> 6312.23s]  No medicine at all.
[6312.23s -> 6314.23s]  I've got acetaminophen, I've got ibuprofen.
[6314.23s -> 6316.23s]  It's fine. The cookies are probably done by now.
[6316.23s -> 6318.23s]  The cookies are done?
[6318.23s -> 6320.23s]  I already sprinkled the pecan in there.
[6320.23s -> 6322.23s]  You put the pecans in? Thank you.
[6322.23s -> 6326.65s]  Appreciate it.
[6328.65s -> 6330.65s]  They smell heavenly.
[6330.65s -> 6332.65s]  They do smell fantastic.
[6332.65s -> 6334.65s]  That's strange.
[6334.65s -> 6336.65s]  Just like my mother used to make them.
[6336.65s -> 6338.65s]  Well, open it up.
[6338.65s -> 6340.65s]  Let's see. How does it look?
[6340.65s -> 6342.65s]  The fruits of your labor.
[6342.65s -> 6344.65s]  It's the fruits of our labor.
[6344.65s -> 6346.65s]  I'm curious.
[6346.65s -> 6348.65s]  I think the plastic from the bowl
[6348.65s -> 6350.65s]  must have transitioned into this.
[6350.65s -> 6352.65s]  Is that the recipe?
[6352.65s -> 6354.65s]  That happens. It's called osmosis.
[6354.65s -> 6356.65s]  If you would have gone to school, you would have learned.
[6356.65s -> 6358.65s]  Edna, could you get one for me?
[6358.65s -> 6360.65s]  I have raw egg all over my hands
[6360.65s -> 6363.21s]  and I don't want to get salmonella.
[6363.21s -> 6365.64s]  You met my grandchildren.
[6365.64s -> 6367.64s]  Salmonella?
[6367.64s -> 6369.64s]  I've got a thing in my throat.
[6369.64s -> 6371.64s]  My twin granddaughters, salmonella, did they come by?
[6371.64s -> 6373.64s]  No.
[6373.64s -> 6375.64s]  Food?
[6375.64s -> 6377.64s]  They love these. I make them for them.
[6377.64s -> 6381.29s]  They're very good. Can I try?
[6381.29s -> 6390.38s]  Would you like one?
[6390.38s -> 6392.38s]  You can keep these, all right?
[6398.31s -> 6400.49s]  Just like sand at the beach.
[6400.49s -> 6402.49s]  I feel sand all up in my underwear.
[6404.49s -> 6406.49s]  It's fantastic. It feels great.
[6406.49s -> 6408.49s]  You look like you're loving it.
[6408.49s -> 6410.49s]  I was probably at the beach at some point.
[6410.49s -> 6412.73s]  These are fantastic.
[6412.73s -> 6414.73s]  I know.
[6414.73s -> 6416.73s]  You just have to feel it.
[6416.73s -> 6418.73s]  Anytime you want to make food, I swear,
[6418.73s -> 6420.73s]  just put the stuff in there.
[6420.73s -> 6422.73s]  It's been about seven or eight hours
[6422.73s -> 6424.73s]  since you've showed up.
[6424.73s -> 6426.73s]  Where do you live?
[6426.73s -> 6428.73s]  Do you need help getting home?
[6428.73s -> 6430.73s]  I usually get lost, but someone will call me
[6430.73s -> 6432.73s]  and I'll have to go down to the police department
[6432.73s -> 6434.73s]  or the bank or something like that.
[6434.73s -> 6436.73s]  It will be fine.
[6436.73s -> 6438.73s]  Do you live in the neighborhood?
[6438.73s -> 6440.73s]  Yes, you don't have a car.
[6440.73s -> 6442.73s]  I could point you to where your house is.
[6442.73s -> 6444.73s]  It's somewhere around that way.
[6446.73s -> 6448.73s]  It's getting late. I'm getting really tired.
[6448.73s -> 6450.73s]  I need the gift basket back.
[6450.73s -> 6452.73s]  Could I have an apple?
[6452.73s -> 6454.73s]  Sure.
[6454.73s -> 6456.73s]  It's a very beautiful apple
[6456.73s -> 6458.73s]  that you've given me.
[6458.73s -> 6460.73s]  If there's anything you ever need,
[6460.73s -> 6462.73s]  I know a lot of people.
[6462.73s -> 6464.73s]  Especially if you have computer problems,
[6464.73s -> 6466.73s]  you let me know, sweetheart.
[6466.73s -> 6468.73s]  I wouldn't answer the phone
[6468.73s -> 6470.73s]  for very many people anymore.
[6470.73s -> 6472.73s]  I have plenty of time.
[6472.73s -> 6474.73s]  It was nice to meet you.
[6474.73s -> 6476.73s]  It was a wonderful meeting.
[6476.73s -> 6478.73s]  Maybe I'll see you again. It was fantastic.
[6478.73s -> 6480.73s]  Thank you for the recipe and everything.
[6480.73s -> 6482.73s]  Absolutely.
[6482.73s -> 6484.73s]  I'm exhausted.
[6484.73s -> 6486.73s]  I hope she gets home okay.
[6486.73s -> 6489.93s]  Is she going to get home okay?
[6489.93s -> 6492.55s]  Should I make sure she's okay?
[6492.55s -> 6495.75s]  She said she doesn't even know if she really lives.
[6495.75s -> 6497.75s]  I have no idea. Should I make sure she's alright?
[6497.75s -> 6501.90s]  I don't know.
[6501.90s -> 6505.29s]  That was an interesting day.
[6505.29s -> 6512.38s]  She's here all day.
[6512.38s -> 6514.38s]  I'm just trying to be nice.
[6514.38s -> 6516.38s]  I'm not trying to get rid of an old lady or something.
[6516.38s -> 6518.38s]  You're here all day.
[6520.68s -> 6523.11s]  I got the fitness instructor here.
[6523.11s -> 6525.11s]  I feel a little tighter.
[6525.11s -> 6527.35s]  I also feel like...
[6527.35s -> 6530.04s]  And we're doing this now, apparently.
[6530.04s -> 6532.47s]  I'm going to do this into the bedroom
[6532.47s -> 6534.47s]  because I'm not fucking leaving the floor again.
[6534.47s -> 6536.47s]  I'm just going to sleep on the floor.
[6536.47s -> 6538.47s]  I'm just going to sleep on the floor.
[7003.98s -> 7009.29s]  No. No thanks.
[7009.29s -> 7019.64s]  Ow.
[7019.64s -> 7025.96s]  What's today?
[7025.96s -> 7029.29s]  Saturday? Thursday?
[7029.29s -> 7032.68s]  Tuesday? I don't know.
[7032.68s -> 7034.68s]  Do I have something to do today? No, I don't know.
[7034.68s -> 7039.10s]  I think three or four people are going to call me.
[7039.10s -> 7042.73s]  They're going to have a meeting.
[7042.73s -> 7044.73s]  I don't know. Whatever happened yesterday,
[7044.73s -> 7046.73s]  I just forget it. As of today, it sucks.
[7046.73s -> 7051.34s]  It happens all the time.
[7051.34s -> 7053.90s]  Just bring me up to speed.
[7053.90s -> 7061.83s]  This is a cool bed.
[7061.83s -> 7070.52s]  Not that cool.
[7072.52s -> 7074.52s]  No, I don't want to...
[7074.52s -> 7076.52s]  Not today. Something else.
[7076.52s -> 7078.52s]  Something else. Not today.
[7078.52s -> 7086.90s]  Fuck. Whatever.
[7086.90s -> 7088.90s]  I'm not even being able to pee before you go to work.
[7088.90s -> 7090.90s]  I'm coming!
[7090.90s -> 7093.34s]  Just wait!
[7093.34s -> 7099.40s]  Look.
[7099.40s -> 7108.74s]  Pecan sandies.
[7108.74s -> 7112.31s]  Time to make the money.
[7112.31s -> 7114.31s]  Wait. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.
[7114.31s -> 7116.62s]  I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.
[7116.62s -> 7118.62s]  Why do you always pull so far down?
[7118.62s -> 7120.62s]  You're pulling my driveway.
[7120.62s -> 7151.34s]  Why do I have to walk down the street to see you?
[7151.34s -> 7156.39s]  Hi, Adam. Hi, Sweden.
[7156.39s -> 7159.66s]  Are you with them?
[7159.66s -> 7164.71s]  You're falling very far behind.
[7164.71s -> 7166.71s]  I don't trust people that work out that much.
[7166.71s -> 7168.71s]  Seriously.
[7168.71s -> 7170.71s]  What do you have to prove?
[7170.71s -> 7172.71s]  You can take a day off.
[7172.71s -> 7174.71s]  You've got Monday, Wednesday, Tuesday, Thursday.
[7174.71s -> 7176.71s]  What do you have to prove?
[7176.71s -> 7178.71s]  I've been working out literally seven days a week. There's no reason to...
[7178.71s -> 7181.14s]  Shit.
[7181.14s -> 7183.14s]  Hey, how are you?
[7183.14s -> 7185.14s]  Hi. It's really great to see you again.
[7185.14s -> 7187.14s]  Yes, I'm one of those people
[7187.14s -> 7189.14s]  that talks a lot of things about somebody
[7189.14s -> 7191.14s]  and then when they see them, they pretend like
[7191.14s -> 7193.14s]  they didn't say those things at all.
[7193.14s -> 7195.51s]  How are you?
[7195.51s -> 7197.51s]  Yes, tomorrow morning.
[7197.51s -> 7199.51s]  16 miles.
[7199.51s -> 7201.51s]  Yes, of course.
[7201.51s -> 7203.51s]  Absolutely.
[7203.51s -> 7206.20s]  If you could do that
[7206.20s -> 7208.20s]  away from my house.
[7208.20s -> 7210.20s]  There's like six different intersections here
[7210.20s -> 7212.76s]  you could go down.
[7212.76s -> 7214.76s]  I don't want to hear that in the morning or in the night.
[7214.76s -> 7221.35s]  Fuck those people.
[7221.35s -> 7233.05s]  I feel like shit.
[7233.05s -> 7236.82s]  Long day.
[7236.82s -> 7238.82s]  I'm hungry and I want
[7238.82s -> 7240.82s]  to shower and I'm not having a great time.
[7240.82s -> 7242.82s]  Those people are having a great time
[7242.82s -> 7244.82s]  outside.
[7244.82s -> 7247.96s]  Why can't I have a good time too?
[7247.96s -> 7249.96s]  I've got like Ted shit here.
[7249.96s -> 7253.93s]  Thank you.
[7253.93s -> 7256.10s]  Some of you listen, some of you don't.
[7256.10s -> 7258.34s]  It's okay.
[7258.34s -> 7279.19s]  So much better.
[7279.19s -> 7282.14s]  But you know what I mean though?
[7282.14s -> 7284.14s]  It's like you work out so much that you don't have time for anything else.
[7284.14s -> 7286.70s]  I don't care
[7286.70s -> 7288.70s]  how much you've worked out.
[7288.70s -> 7291.32s]  Look, I'm just trying to live.
[7291.32s -> 7293.32s]  If I sit down and we're at lunch and you say
[7293.32s -> 7295.32s]  like, oh hey dude, by the way
[7295.32s -> 7297.32s]  I could do like
[7297.32s -> 7299.32s]  500 pounds five times for the rep.
[7299.32s -> 7301.32s]  I don't care.
[7301.32s -> 7303.56s]  That's good for you. You're saying that because I
[7303.56s -> 7305.56s]  can't do that. You're saying that to me because
[7305.56s -> 7307.56s]  I can't do it.
[7307.56s -> 7311.14s]  God, you know what I can do?
[7311.14s -> 7313.14s]  You know what I can do that they can't?
[7313.14s -> 7316.41s]  Not much.
[7316.41s -> 7318.97s]  Not very much at all actually.
[7318.97s -> 7320.97s]  Actually it hurts to walk around for me at the moment.
[7320.97s -> 7324.23s]  But you know what? One day I'll get there.
[7324.23s -> 7327.18s]  That feels better.
[7327.18s -> 7346.62s]  What is this?
[7346.62s -> 7350.20s]  But they that wait upon the Lord
[7350.20s -> 7352.20s]  shall renew their strength. They shall mount up
[7352.20s -> 7354.20s]  with wings as eagles.
[7354.20s -> 7356.20s]  They shall run and not be weary
[7356.20s -> 7358.20s]  and they shall walk and not faint.
[7358.20s -> 7362.87s]  You know, I've actually seen this in somebody's bathroom
[7362.87s -> 7365.56s]  before.
[7365.56s -> 7369.66s]  I've seen that before.
[7369.66s -> 7371.66s]  Whatever. I guess it should sit here. Here it is.
[7371.66s -> 7379.83s]  Showered.
[7379.83s -> 7381.83s]  I feel clean. I feel good.
[7381.83s -> 7383.83s]  Although I'm kind of not having a great time
[7383.83s -> 7386.65s]  but you know, whatever.
[7386.65s -> 7388.65s]  I got my expensive watch. That's all that matters, right?
[7388.65s -> 7407.26s]  Let's go to the bathroom.
[7407.26s -> 7418.14s]  Let's fucking stool out of the way.
[7418.14s -> 7420.14s]  I don't know. I have to look at this
[7420.14s -> 7422.38s]  every time I pee.
[7422.38s -> 7424.38s]  By the way, that's like
[7424.38s -> 7426.68s]  what are you blurring?
[7426.68s -> 7428.68s]  There's somebody like sitting on that toilet
[7428.68s -> 7431.18s]  that you're blurring.
[7431.18s -> 7433.18s]  Who is that? That's not
[7433.18s -> 7435.80s]  me. Oops!
[7435.80s -> 7438.74s]  Wait, I'm done. Okay, we're good.
[7438.74s -> 7442.01s]  Like there's somebody else sitting on
[7442.01s -> 7445.66s]  that toilet. No, no, no,
[7445.66s -> 7447.66s]  no, no. I'm going to the bedroom.
[7447.66s -> 7459.11s]  You gave me this like mystery box of
[7459.11s -> 7462.06s]  stools. I'm gonna place them.
[7462.06s -> 7471.32s]  What time is it? It's pretty
[7471.32s -> 7475.29s]  late. It's alright. We'll put two
[7475.29s -> 7478.55s]  here. We'll put one over here.
[7478.55s -> 7481.05s]  Not like it matters.
[7481.05s -> 7485.66s]  I don't know. I'm getting
[7485.66s -> 7489.56s]  kind of annoyed.
[7489.56s -> 7491.56s]  What do I even need these stools for?
[7491.56s -> 7493.56s]  I'm okay. Don't get too upset.
[7493.56s -> 7496.82s]  Hey, this is how tall I want to be.
[7496.82s -> 7500.60s]  All of you are the five, seven
[7500.60s -> 7503.10s]  men out there. You ever thought
[7503.10s -> 7505.10s]  about this? You ever think about how big you were?
[7505.10s -> 7508.74s]  If you were this big?
[7508.74s -> 7510.98s]  This is what? Six, six, two?
[7510.98s -> 7512.98s]  Man. God, what a figure
[7512.98s -> 7515.22s]  that would be. Wouldn't it?
[7515.22s -> 7520.66s]  How about, um,
[7520.66s -> 7525.34s]  I don't know. We can put them next to the bed.
[7525.34s -> 7530.63s]  How about like one here?
[7530.63s -> 7534.41s]  One here. And then
[7534.41s -> 7537.59s]  should all three go over there?
[7537.59s -> 7539.59s]  I don't hate that. I really don't.
[7539.59s -> 7551.62s]  Three stools in front
[7551.62s -> 7553.62s]  of the bed. I don't know if you get on the side.
[7553.62s -> 7557.02s]  If you're as tired as I am
[7557.02s -> 7559.02s]  right now, that seems like a pretty good idea.
[7559.02s -> 7561.26s]  That means I can get out of the bed. I can put my feet
[7561.26s -> 7563.26s]  down on three different places.
[7563.26s -> 7569.19s]  Ugh. I am
[7569.19s -> 7575.78s]  tired. How much
[7575.78s -> 7579.37s]  cash do we have? How much money?
[7579.37s -> 7582.70s]  What do we got for cash?
[7582.70s -> 7584.70s]  $19.60. Give me something
[7584.70s -> 7591.74s]  nice for God's sakes.
[7591.74s -> 7593.74s]  I got money. So, no, that makes sense
[7593.74s -> 7595.74s]  because then I don't have to clean all this shit up. That's a good idea.
[7595.74s -> 7600.22s]  Calling a maid is a good idea.
[7600.22s -> 7604.87s]  Thank you.
[7604.87s -> 7606.87s]  Because the last, I don't want to clean
[7606.87s -> 7608.87s]  anything up. I want to be able to have somebody else do it.
[7608.87s -> 7610.87s]  We got almost two grand. Let's use it.
[7610.87s -> 7615.78s]  Hi. Yes.
[7615.78s -> 7617.78s]  I would love to, I'd like to have a service
[7617.78s -> 7621.43s]  started please. Yeah, the address
[7621.43s -> 7623.43s]  is 9-8-5, 9-8-5, Dollhouse Way.
[7623.43s -> 7626.18s]  I mean, you know
[7626.18s -> 7628.18s]  you're in this fucked up cartoon universe
[7628.18s -> 7630.18s]  with the rest of us. Yeah.
[7630.18s -> 7633.82s]  Okay. Thank you.
[7633.82s -> 7636.18s]  Do you live in the neighborhood too?
[7636.18s -> 7638.18s]  Are you like down the street? Because it seems like everybody lives next to each other here.
[7638.18s -> 7641.32s]  Okay.
[7641.32s -> 7644.06s]  Thank you. Today?
[7644.06s -> 7646.06s]  I mean, I'm tired, but okay, fine. That's fine.
[7646.06s -> 7649.51s]  Alright, goodbye. Alright, let's get a maid
[7649.51s -> 7651.51s]  in here. I don't want to have to deal with this. They'll take care of it.
[7651.51s -> 7656.63s]  That was very, that was very quick.
[7656.63s -> 7658.63s]  They're here. They must, they must
[7658.63s -> 7663.94s]  live in the neighborhood.
[7663.94s -> 7667.27s]  I'm so tired though.
[7667.27s -> 7670.66s]  Alright, maid service.
[7670.66s -> 7672.66s]  Here we are.
[7672.66s -> 7676.55s]  Hi. Hi.
[7676.55s -> 7679.18s]  I'm assuming that
[7679.18s -> 7681.18s]  you must be the maid?
[7681.18s -> 7683.18s]  I heard you ordered a sexy maid service.
[7683.18s -> 7687.66s]  You can stop.
[7687.66s -> 7689.66s]  You have a big mess to clean, don't you?
[7689.66s -> 7691.66s]  Stop doing the lap track. I don't want that.
[7691.66s -> 7693.66s]  Yes, there's a mess in here. It's very messy.
[7693.66s -> 7695.66s]  Well, trust me. I can take care of your big mess.
[7695.66s -> 7698.02s]  Okay, come on in.
[7698.02s -> 7700.02s]  Show me where it is.
[7700.02s -> 7702.02s]  Pretty much what I want you to do.
[7702.02s -> 7704.02s]  Come on in and watch the door behind you.
[7704.02s -> 7706.02s]  You don't want to get hit by that.
[7706.02s -> 7708.02s]  Such a gentleman.
[7708.02s -> 7710.02s]  What a unique arrangement.
[7710.02s -> 7712.02s]  Yeah, so there's this trash here.
[7712.02s -> 7714.02s]  This is dusty?
[7714.02s -> 7716.02s]  Yes, it is. It's very dusty.
[7716.02s -> 7718.02s]  So if you want to dust, you can, there's
[7718.02s -> 7720.02s]  some fruit here that needs to be cleaned up.
[7720.02s -> 7722.02s]  Oh, saw stain.
[7722.02s -> 7724.02s]  So there's, in the bathroom,
[7724.02s -> 7726.02s]  the toilet needs to be cleaned.
[7726.02s -> 7728.02s]  The trash needs to be taken out, this flower,
[7728.02s -> 7730.02s]  the fridge needs to be cleaned.
[7730.02s -> 7732.02s]  This room, the bathroom, any other rooms?
[7732.02s -> 7735.29s]  Yes, come with me. I'll show you.
[7735.29s -> 7737.29s]  The bathroom definitely needs to be cleaned.
[7737.29s -> 7739.29s]  The sinks need to be cleaned.
[7739.29s -> 7741.29s]  If you have an opportunity to, it would be great.
[7741.29s -> 7743.29s]  How much do you charge?
[7743.29s -> 7745.29s]  Well, for you, I'll drop my prices to
[7745.29s -> 7747.53s]  $2,000.
[7747.53s -> 7749.53s]  That's $2,000 for this?
[7749.53s -> 7751.53s]  For the sexy maid service.
[7751.53s -> 7753.53s]  Why is this $2,000?
[7753.53s -> 7755.53s]  No, it's like $100. It's not $2,000.
[7755.53s -> 7757.53s]  Well, lead me to the bedroom and I can
[7757.53s -> 7759.53s]  show I'm worth $2,000.
[7759.53s -> 7761.53s]  No.
[7761.53s -> 7763.53s]  $2,000.
[7763.53s -> 7765.53s]  What are you trying to say?
[7765.53s -> 7767.53s]  Am I not sexy?
[7767.53s -> 7769.53s]  I didn't say any of that. I'm looking for
[7769.53s -> 7771.53s]  a maid service to help clean up, maybe make the bed.
[7771.53s -> 7773.53s]  Okay. How sexy
[7773.53s -> 7775.83s]  am I worth?
[7775.83s -> 7777.83s]  I don't have $2,000.
[7777.83s -> 7779.83s]  Okay, well you're the one who called a sexy
[7779.83s -> 7782.71s]  maid service.
[7782.71s -> 7784.71s]  Well, honestly,
[7784.71s -> 7786.71s]  I think you look great. I do.
[7786.71s -> 7788.71s]  I think you're probably the best looking maid service
[7788.71s -> 7790.71s]  maid I've ever seen in my life.
[7790.71s -> 7794.55s]  Do you mean that?
[7794.55s -> 7796.79s]  Yes, of course. Go on.
[7796.79s -> 7798.79s]  I think you're the most attractive,
[7798.79s -> 7800.79s]  sexiest maid ever.
[7800.79s -> 7803.35s]  I do. I really do.
[7803.35s -> 7805.35s]  Please keep going. You're so wonderful.
[7807.35s -> 7809.35s]  Let me show you the bathroom.
[7809.35s -> 7811.35s]  Okay, come on into the bathroom.
[7811.35s -> 7814.74s]  So, I have a plunger.
[7814.74s -> 7816.74s]  I have a plunger.
[7816.74s -> 7818.74s]  And if anything ever happens to the toilet,
[7818.74s -> 7820.74s]  I'm sure you'll be coming and going over the course of the
[7820.74s -> 7822.74s]  Do you just want me to clean your house?
[7822.74s -> 7825.05s]  Uh, yeah.
[7825.05s -> 7828.06s]  Why didn't you just call a regular
[7828.06s -> 7830.06s]  I'm a sexy maid.
[7830.06s -> 7832.06s]  That's...
[7832.06s -> 7834.06s]  What do you mean sexy maid?
[7834.06s -> 7836.06s]  Well, like a regular maid service is like a hundred,
[7836.06s -> 7838.06s]  maybe two. But when you add the sexy,
[7838.06s -> 7840.06s]  it's $2,000 for a maid.
[7840.06s -> 7842.06s]  Well, what would you do for $100?
[7842.06s -> 7844.06s]  Clean your house, I guess.
[7844.06s -> 7846.06s]  That's perfect. That works for me.
[7846.06s -> 7848.06s]  $200?
[7848.06s -> 7850.06s]  Are you coming here every other day?
[7850.06s -> 7852.06s]  Yeah, I'll come. You still think I look sexy, though, right?
[7852.06s -> 7854.06s]  I do, I do. $200,
[7854.06s -> 7856.06s]  is that all right with you? You want to go lower?
[7856.06s -> 7858.06s]  That's okay with $150.
[7858.06s -> 7860.06s]  But if you're ever interested in
[7860.06s -> 7862.06s]  expanding
[7862.06s -> 7864.06s]  my rules.
[7864.06s -> 7866.06s]  Yes, I will keep that very much in mind. If you come this way
[7866.06s -> 7868.06s]  and just take a look and start doing your thing,
[7868.06s -> 7871.32s]  I'll clean over here.
[7871.32s -> 7873.32s]  Pick that before I fucking shit my pants in front of the maid.
[7873.32s -> 7876.07s]  Sexy maid.
[7876.07s -> 7878.38s]  $2,000.
[7878.38s -> 7880.38s]  That's so much money.
[7880.38s -> 7887.48s]  I'm just trying to get my life
[7887.48s -> 7889.72s]  together in here before I go back in there.
[7889.72s -> 7894.84s]  And I'm fucking tired, too.
[7896.84s -> 7904.06s]  It's four.
[7904.06s -> 7906.06s]  Thank you so much.
[7906.06s -> 7913.61s]  Wait, where is it going?
[7913.61s -> 7915.61s]  Wait, what?
[7915.61s -> 7917.61s]  Am I sick?
[7917.61s -> 7919.61s]  Do I have
[7919.61s -> 7921.61s]  the norovirus? What's happening?
[7921.61s -> 7923.61s]  Sir?
[7923.61s -> 7925.61s]  Yeah? Are you all right?
[7925.61s -> 7927.61s]  I'm okay in here. You don't have to come in.
[7927.61s -> 7929.61s]  Do you have a big mess you need cleaning?
[7932.17s -> 7934.17s]  No, you can stay out there.
[7934.17s -> 7936.86s]  Okay.
[7936.86s -> 7939.54s]  All right, that's good. What did I eat?
[7939.54s -> 7941.54s]  Those pecan sandies, I swear to God.
[7941.54s -> 7948.84s]  Do you like
[7948.84s -> 7951.34s]  food? Yeah.
[7951.34s -> 7953.34s]  Do you like bread? Yeah.
[7953.34s -> 7955.34s]  I wonder if they'll help. Wait, my bread?
[7955.34s -> 7957.34s]  Yes, this bread. I got multi-grain bread over there.
[7957.34s -> 7959.34s]  Wow. Do you like multi-grain bread?
[7959.34s -> 7961.34s]  I like multi-grain bread. Yeah.
[7961.34s -> 7963.58s]  Could I ask you why?
[7963.58s -> 7965.94s]  Aesthetically,
[7965.94s -> 7967.94s]  I thought it made sense to put it in the corner here
[7967.94s -> 7969.94s]  to make sure there's enough room for people to come around.
[7969.94s -> 7971.94s]  There's not enough space. Maybe eventually
[7971.94s -> 7973.94s]  there'll be a TV up here, like a big screen TV
[7973.94s -> 7975.94s]  up here. Okay. Yeah, like they could watch
[7975.94s -> 7977.94s]  the TV, play video games.
[7977.94s -> 7979.94s]  It would have made sense so they could flush.
[7979.94s -> 7981.94s]  Well, you're a maid. You're not an interior designer.
[7981.94s -> 7983.94s]  You're right. I'm just a maid.
[7983.94s -> 7991.30s]  That was the bread.
[7991.30s -> 7994.06s]  That was the bread we have to eat.
[7994.06s -> 8001.22s]  I'll clean the bathroom next.
[8001.22s -> 8017.53s]  I can still eat it.
[8017.53s -> 8019.53s]  Uh, excuse me, uh,
[8019.53s -> 8021.53s]  sexy maid. What?
[8021.53s -> 8023.53s]  Would you like a piece of bread?
[8023.53s -> 8026.41s]  Sure.
[8026.41s -> 8030.89s]  Okay.
[8030.89s -> 8032.89s]  Let's get some bread on the fucking stovetop.
[8032.89s -> 8039.72s]  Would you like a piece of bread?
[8039.72s -> 8041.72s]  I've got bread, and they throw it on the ground, but it's okay.
[8041.72s -> 8044.73s]  Why don't you grab a piece of bread? I want you to eat.
[8044.73s -> 8047.61s]  Well, I've been cleaning. I wouldn't
[8047.61s -> 8049.61s]  dare touch it with my hands.
[8049.61s -> 8051.61s]  Right, but just eat.
[8051.61s -> 8055.45s]  Wash your hands and then eat.
[8055.45s -> 8057.45s]  I'm not putting it in your mouth. Right, no, of course.
[8057.45s -> 8060.97s]  Sorry, I'm just used to different
[8060.97s -> 8066.02s]  clients is all.
[8066.02s -> 8068.52s]  Out of here. I'm getting out of here.
[8068.52s -> 8071.40s]  I'm getting out of here.
[8071.40s -> 8076.71s]  I'm going to the bathroom.
[8076.71s -> 8078.95s]  I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to stay here.
[8078.95s -> 8080.95s]  And, excuse me,
[8080.95s -> 8084.09s]  this job
[8084.09s -> 8086.09s]  is not done.
[8086.09s -> 8089.67s]  The maid is scaring me.
[8089.67s -> 8094.15s]  Our job's not done.
[8094.15s -> 8100.02s]  I'm so tired.
[8100.02s -> 8102.02s]  God, I think I'm going to pass out.
[8102.02s -> 8104.26s]  I think I really am going to pass out.
[8104.26s -> 8107.91s]  I need to go to bed. I have to go to bed so bad.
[8107.91s -> 8113.10s]  I'm sorry if I smell
[8113.10s -> 8115.10s]  a little weird. It's just, it's been a long day.
[8115.10s -> 8119.77s]  Well, that's two hundred dollars.
[8119.77s -> 8122.58s]  Are you going to, what?
[8122.58s -> 8125.91s]  Two hundred? I thought it was one
[8125.91s -> 8128.60s]  fifty. I cleaned more than
[8128.60s -> 8130.60s]  I thought I had to. There was a big mess in the bathroom.
[8130.60s -> 8133.67s]  Okay, take two
[8133.67s -> 8136.04s]  hundred. Alright, sir, well,
[8136.04s -> 8138.04s]  I'll see you in a few days. Yeah,
[8138.04s -> 8140.04s]  and it's one hundred fifty each time, right?
[8140.04s -> 8142.04s]  From here on out, we'll talk about it.
[8142.04s -> 8144.04s]  And we're not doing anything else.
[8144.04s -> 8146.04s]  You still want me to wear this next time I come?
[8146.04s -> 8148.04s]  If you like, if you're
[8148.04s -> 8150.04s]  comfortable wearing that, you can.
[8150.04s -> 8159.64s]  You dog. It's been a weird
[8159.64s -> 8162.46s]  day. I'm tired.
[8162.46s -> 8164.63s]  Give me something to play with. Give me something to hang out
[8164.63s -> 8166.63s]  with. I mean, you guys, seriously, like, I,
[8166.63s -> 8168.63s]  I gotta go to bed. I can't
[8168.63s -> 8170.63s]  just sleep on a couch every fucking day.
[8170.63s -> 8172.63s]  Give me, like, give me, like, give me the bedroom.
[8172.63s -> 8181.08s]  Get me to get me to bed. What
[8181.08s -> 8188.57s]  is it? What does it say?
[8188.57s -> 8195.35s]  You didn't want it? What?
[8195.35s -> 8204.89s]  Why not? Scammed.
[8204.89s -> 8209.50s]  I, literally, I can,
[8209.50s -> 8211.50s]  all I can see is colors. It's
[8211.50s -> 8213.50s]  the only thing I can see. I just see pink and I see
[8213.50s -> 8215.50s]  like green. I see pink here.
[8215.50s -> 8220.49s]  It's just pink.
[8220.49s -> 8222.49s]  I need somebody who has to tell me to
[8222.49s -> 8224.49s]  go to bed. If I don't, then
[8224.49s -> 8226.49s]  you're just gonna get me fucked up again.
[8226.49s -> 8228.49s]  All I see is pink colors. Is it?
[8228.49s -> 8231.56s]  That was really cool made. I really
[8231.56s -> 8233.56s]  thought they were cool. I like to work out people too.
[8233.56s -> 8235.74s]  I'm gonna get into the bedroom as fast
[8235.74s -> 8237.74s]  as I can because I don't want to have a problem.
[8237.74s -> 8240.49s]  For the first time fucking ever.
[8240.49s -> 8242.49s]  For the first time ever you made me
[8242.49s -> 8244.49s]  go to sleep. Thank you. Seriously,
[8244.49s -> 8246.49s]  like, this is the first time you've ever done it.
[8246.49s -> 8248.49s]  Took you long enough.
[8802.46s -> 8812.68s]  Um, what is that?
[8812.68s -> 8823.62s]  What is that? Why is there a computer
[8823.62s -> 8825.62s]  in my, in front of my fucking door?
[8825.62s -> 8829.72s]  There's a computer here?
[8829.72s -> 8831.72s]  What is outside? I hear something.
[8831.72s -> 8837.10s]  Dog or something?
[8837.10s -> 8841.51s]  Oh no.
[8841.51s -> 8847.46s]  My god.
[8847.46s -> 8850.22s]  Oh my fucking
[8850.22s -> 8853.10s]  god.
[8853.10s -> 8855.10s]  I don't know what to do. What am I doing
[8855.10s -> 8857.10s]  in this scenario? Is it because of the food?
[8857.10s -> 8859.10s]  Oh it's trash!
[8859.10s -> 8864.58s]  Um, what time
[8864.58s -> 8866.58s]  is it? It's fucking like
[8866.58s -> 8868.82s]  one o'clock in the morning.
[8868.82s -> 8872.54s]  Oh shit.
[8872.54s -> 8878.04s]  Are you gonna see me? I hope
[8878.04s -> 8881.75s]  you can't see me. What the
[8881.75s -> 8883.75s]  what am I supposed to do about this? I gotta go in the other
[8883.75s -> 8887.14s]  I gotta go in the bedroom.
[8887.14s -> 8889.14s]  Oh my god.
[8889.14s -> 8891.51s]  But yay, computer.
[8891.51s -> 8898.68s]  Cool.
[8898.68s -> 8901.24s]  Huh? You want me to do
[8901.24s -> 8904.82s]  what? I don't know.
[8904.82s -> 8906.82s]  I'm not going out there. What the fuck am I
[8906.82s -> 8911.11s]  doing?
[8911.11s -> 8914.12s]  Uh, alright.
[8914.12s -> 8916.12s]  It's time for you to pay. I don't want to go
[8916.12s -> 8919.06s]  out here.
[8919.06s -> 8921.06s]  Why would you make me do this?
[8921.06s -> 8923.06s]  Hey bear, you're in deep shit.
[8923.06s -> 8925.37s]  Oh
[8925.37s -> 8927.61s]  oh
[8927.61s -> 8929.61s]  Oh my god, he's biting
[8929.61s -> 8931.61s]  me. Oh my body.
[8931.61s -> 8933.61s]  Jesus.
[8933.61s -> 8935.61s]  Play dead, play dead, play dead.
[8935.61s -> 8938.04s]  Play dead, play dead.
[8945.74s -> 9001.78s]  What are you doing?
[9001.78s -> 9007.80s]  Do you see what he did out here? Why
[9007.80s -> 9011.38s]  don't you make me go confront him?
[9011.38s -> 9013.38s]  Are you out of your mind? Are you out of
[9013.38s -> 9016.71s]  your mind? What am I
[9016.71s -> 9018.71s]  gonna do versus a bear
[9018.71s -> 9020.71s]  that's five times as big as me?
[9020.71s -> 9024.23s]  Oh
[9024.23s -> 9028.14s]  I didn't even sleep
[9028.14s -> 9031.78s]  all the way through the night. Oh
[9031.78s -> 9036.97s]  this is messy. Good thing
[9036.97s -> 9038.97s]  I have a maid. At least they'll be able to help me clean
[9038.97s -> 9040.97s]  this shit up.
[9040.97s -> 9042.97s]  Close the door for the love of god.
[9042.97s -> 9044.97s]  I don't want to fucking, why are there
[9044.97s -> 9048.23s]  bears here?
[9048.23s -> 9051.69s]  Oh god.
[9067.82s -> 9070.57s]  I'm here. Wait.
[9091.88s -> 9120.81s]  Go fuck yourself. Good thing I got my
[9120.81s -> 9127.14s]  watch. I feel so bad.
[9129.96s -> 9131.96s]  Oh there's a mess in my yard.
[9131.96s -> 9133.96s]  There's a mess in my yard.
[9133.96s -> 9135.96s]  There's a mess.
[9135.96s -> 9138.84s]  There's a mess in my yard.
[9141.21s -> 9145.16s]  Wait.
[9160.78s -> 9162.95s]  I've covered his face. I've covered his bruises.
[9162.95s -> 9164.95s]  I need to go to the
[9164.95s -> 9166.95s]  sleep a lot for a while and then I need to go
[9166.95s -> 9168.95s]  and get something to eat and then I need to
[9168.95s -> 9177.14s]  have something to do.
[9177.14s -> 9181.56s]  Holy shit. I can't
[9181.56s -> 9184.18s]  stream right now. There's no way
[9184.18s -> 9186.18s]  I can stream. What do you want me to stream?
[9188.18s -> 9190.18s]  Oh no!
[9190.18s -> 9192.18s]  No! I refuse.
[9192.18s -> 9194.18s]  I can't.
[9194.18s -> 9196.18s]  I can't.
[9196.18s -> 9198.94s]  I can't.
[9198.94s -> 9201.82s]  I can't.
[9217.14s -> 9219.14s]  Hey what's going on everybody? It's Jerma here.
[9219.14s -> 9221.14s]  We're going to be playing some Call of Duty.
[9221.14s -> 9223.14s]  So as you can see here
[9223.14s -> 9225.14s]  I'm going to be in the menu for a little while.
[9225.14s -> 9227.14s]  And welcome to the stream. It's good to have you here.
[9227.14s -> 9229.14s]  Of course I have a pretty good day today.
[9229.14s -> 9231.14s]  I had a crazy
[9231.14s -> 9233.14s]  scenario happen. A crazy scenario.
[9233.14s -> 9235.14s]  Yeah. Hold on let me get in here.
[9235.14s -> 9237.45s]  What's that?
[9237.45s -> 9239.45s]  Oh no way dude. Yeah that's so funny.
[9239.45s -> 9241.45s]  But dude I saw a bear outside today.
[9241.45s -> 9243.45s]  Yeah it was in the trash
[9243.45s -> 9245.45s]  and I walked out there and I was like what the heck
[9245.45s -> 9247.45s]  is that bear? And eventually
[9247.45s -> 9249.45s]  I went outside and I did like a little
[9249.45s -> 9251.45s]  horn and the bear like
[9251.45s -> 9253.45s]  got away from the horn.
[9253.45s -> 9258.12s]  Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.
[9258.12s -> 9687.69s]  Beep. Beep. Beep.
[9687.69s -> 9693.19s]  Shit when I sleep. What does it say?
[9693.19s -> 9696.06s]  The fucking
[9696.06s -> 9698.55s]  water does that.
[9698.55s -> 9701.50s]  You have been banned
[9701.50s -> 9703.50s]  from Twitch for 24 hours as temporary
[9703.50s -> 9705.50s]  ban for sleeping on stream.
[9705.50s -> 9708.25s]  Oh what the fuck?
[9708.25s -> 9713.30s]  What?
[9713.30s -> 9715.30s]  When did I go to sleep? I didn't go to sleep on stream.
[9715.30s -> 9721.00s]  What are you talking about?
[9721.00s -> 9727.59s]  Give me a fucking break.
[9727.59s -> 9729.59s]  A ban? That's the first ban I've ever had.
[9729.59s -> 9732.15s]  Are you sure I didn't get banned because I'm streaming
[9732.15s -> 9736.82s]  from my toilet? Sleeping
[9736.82s -> 9738.82s]  on stream I think is way less offensive
[9738.82s -> 9740.82s]  than like shitting on the toilet
[9740.82s -> 9744.02s]  and streaming. Just
[9744.02s -> 9747.22s]  like that. That's six by the way.
[9747.22s -> 9758.23s]  I'd like to take a shower right now please.
[9758.23s -> 9772.23s]  Ugh. It's the first ban
[9772.23s -> 9777.48s]  I've ever had. I hope I didn't like see
[9777.48s -> 9781.19s]  anything weird in my sleep. Fucking
[9781.19s -> 9783.19s]  starving and stuff. Oh yi yi.
[9783.19s -> 9788.25s]  Ugh. Ban
[9788.25s -> 9791.90s]  from Twitch.
[9791.90s -> 9794.46s]  Can I call anybody?
[9794.46s -> 9799.51s]  I don't know. I say all kinds of weird
[9799.51s -> 9801.51s]  fucked up shit. Let me just brush my teeth real quick.
[9801.51s -> 9804.01s]  There we go.
[9804.01s -> 9807.59s]  Brush your teeth in the shower.
[9807.59s -> 9809.59s]  It saves about five minutes. That's a pro
[9809.59s -> 9811.83s]  tip for everybody. Coming up.
[9811.83s -> 9822.12s]  So what happened?
[9822.12s -> 9824.12s]  Why is there like
[9824.12s -> 9826.12s]  an office chair next
[9826.12s -> 9828.81s]  to the toilet?
[9828.81s -> 9831.11s]  Why would there be an
[9831.11s -> 9833.11s]  office chair here? In case somebody
[9833.11s -> 9835.61s]  wanted to watch?
[9835.61s -> 9837.61s]  Oh hey man you got an extra seat? Yeah.
[9837.61s -> 9839.61s]  You sit in the toilet I'll watch you.
[9839.61s -> 9841.61s]  Why is there an office chair?
[9841.61s -> 9844.17s]  I'm starving.
[9844.17s -> 9851.40s]  It's a piece of bread on the ground.
[9851.40s -> 9858.81s]  Good.
[9862.14s -> 9864.14s]  I'm not going to work today by the way
[9864.14s -> 9866.14s]  just in case you were curious.
[9866.14s -> 9868.14s]  Not going to work.
[9868.14s -> 9870.55s]  You can leave without me.
[9870.55s -> 9873.11s]  I got plenty of money. Go on.
[9873.11s -> 9875.11s]  Not going to work. Go on.
[9875.11s -> 9878.06s]  Without me. And tell the boss I said
[9878.06s -> 9880.06s]  I'm the biggest producer so I can
[9880.06s -> 9882.87s]  stay home.
[9884.87s -> 9889.59s]  What is this?
[9889.59s -> 9897.85s]  Does this work?
[9897.85s -> 9900.73s]  Is this an organ?
[9900.73s -> 9925.50s]  I don't think it works.
[9925.50s -> 9927.50s]  How about we play Radical Dreamers from
[9927.50s -> 9930.95s]  Chrono Cross?
[9930.95s -> 9966.14s]  Pretty good!
[9966.14s -> 9968.57s]  And how about Super Mario?
[9968.57s -> 9977.34s]  Sounds fucking
[9977.34s -> 9979.34s]  terrible.
[9979.34s -> 9981.58s]  Can I do like reverb?
[9981.58s -> 9992.78s]  What?
[9996.98s -> 10006.78s]  There we go.
[10006.78s -> 10008.78s]  Now we can now get it.
[10021.40s -> 10023.40s]  What do they want me to do?
[10023.40s -> 10035.82s]  Food.
[10035.82s -> 10038.57s]  How about a piece of
[10038.57s -> 10043.11s]  bread?
[10043.11s -> 10045.11s]  Because it's the easiest thing to make.
[10045.11s -> 10058.15s]  I like to toast it.
[10058.15s -> 10065.62s]  I like to toast it real quick.
[10065.62s -> 10068.82s]  Better. I do have to pee though.
[10068.82s -> 10071.90s]  Or, you know, the other one.
[10071.90s -> 10077.38s]  I'm sad that the
[10077.38s -> 10079.38s]  maid threw this on the ground though.
[10079.38s -> 10084.12s]  I'm going to play the organ again.
[10084.12s -> 10091.80s]  It works.
[10091.80s -> 10104.02s]  What do the pedals do?
[10104.02s -> 10106.02s]  Holy shit.
[10141.32s -> 10146.09s]  Hey, what? Ludwig?
[10146.09s -> 10148.09s]  Yeah.
[10148.09s -> 10150.46s]  What are you doing here?
[10150.46s -> 10153.21s]  You live here?
[10153.21s -> 10155.21s]  What are you talking about? You live here.
[10155.21s -> 10157.21s]  I'm sorry.
[10157.21s -> 10159.21s]  I've lived here for like seven years.
[10159.21s -> 10161.21s]  Hold on.
[10161.21s -> 10163.21s]  983, 983.
[10163.21s -> 10165.21s]  You're 983?
[10165.21s -> 10167.51s]  I'm 983.
[10167.51s -> 10169.51s]  I do not know.
[10169.51s -> 10171.51s]  I don't know. Just hold on.
[10171.51s -> 10173.51s]  Don't mind any of this shit.
[10173.51s -> 10175.51s]  It's fine.
[10175.51s -> 10177.51s]  Why do you have
[10177.51s -> 10179.51s]  trash everywhere?
[10179.51s -> 10181.51s]  No, don't worry about that.
[10181.51s -> 10183.51s]  There was a tornado that came in.
[10183.51s -> 10185.51s]  Did you see the tornado that came in?
[10185.51s -> 10187.51s]  No, but yeah, they come sometimes.
[10187.51s -> 10189.51s]  A tornado flew through here.
[10192.84s -> 10194.84s]  The tornado flew in
[10194.84s -> 10196.84s]  and it swarmed everybody.
[10196.84s -> 10198.84s]  You didn't get that?
[10198.84s -> 10201.34s]  I didn't.
[10201.34s -> 10203.34s]  The gloves are also a little confusing to me.
[10203.34s -> 10205.34s]  Is that normal?
[10205.34s -> 10207.51s]  Yeah, it's very normal.
[10207.51s -> 10209.51s]  Tornado came in, ruined everything.
[10209.51s -> 10211.51s]  It's nice to see you.
[10211.51s -> 10213.51s]  It's nice to see you too. Do you want to come in?
[10213.51s -> 10215.51s]  Sure.
[10215.51s -> 10217.51s]  I was just playing this
[10217.51s -> 10219.51s]  because it was a gift from a friend of mine.
[10222.14s -> 10224.14s]  I'll get it for you.
[10224.14s -> 10226.14s]  We should clean.
[10226.14s -> 10229.14s]  I want to clean first.
[10229.14s -> 10231.14s]  You want me to clean with you?
[10231.14s -> 10233.14s]  I'm sorry. Can you just help me for a second?
[10233.14s -> 10235.14s]  Sure. You know we've never met before.
[10235.14s -> 10237.14s]  When did you move in here?
[10237.14s -> 10239.14s]  I've lived here for...
[10239.14s -> 10241.14s]  Excuse me.
[10241.14s -> 10243.14s]  Sheriff Tony Andrews. How you guys doing?
[10243.14s -> 10245.14s]  Sheriff, how's it going?
[10245.14s -> 10247.14s]  Listen, we're looking for a bear.
[10247.14s -> 10249.14s]  Have you seen the bear around here?
[10249.14s -> 10251.14s]  We're going around the whole neighborhood.
[10251.14s -> 10253.14s]  I've got animal control with me.
[10253.14s -> 10255.14s]  How you doing?
[10255.14s -> 10257.14s]  He's an expert at this stuff.
[10257.14s -> 10259.14s]  There was a tornado and a bear came in.
[10259.14s -> 10261.14s]  There was a bear and a tornado?
[10261.14s -> 10263.14s]  I kicked the shit out of the bear.
[10263.14s -> 10265.14s]  There was a tornado.
[10265.14s -> 10267.14s]  I can smell them.
[10268.14s -> 10270.14s]  I was going to say I didn't see a tornado either.
[10270.14s -> 10272.14s]  I'm pretty sure there's no tornadoes around here.
[10274.14s -> 10276.14s]  You guys like organs?
[10276.14s -> 10278.14s]  No. Have you seen a bear or not?
[10278.14s -> 10280.14s]  I had a bear I encountered yesterday.
[10282.14s -> 10284.14s]  You're a full day late.
[10284.14s -> 10286.14s]  He's waiting to go.
[10286.14s -> 10288.14s]  I don't know. He's a bear.
[10288.14s -> 10290.14s]  He's a fucking bear.
[10290.14s -> 10292.14s]  You got a scent?
[10292.14s -> 10294.14s]  I can smell him.
[10294.14s -> 10296.14s]  I think he went this way.
[10296.14s -> 10298.14s]  Nothing tricks this.
[10298.14s -> 10300.14s]  Why is everybody coming to my house?
[10300.14s -> 10302.14s]  We'll find him.
[10302.14s -> 10304.14s]  Listen, Sheriff Tony Andrews,
[10304.14s -> 10306.14s]  if you need anything, give me a call.
[10306.14s -> 10308.14s]  Pick up the trash.
[10308.14s -> 10310.14s]  Let's keep the neighborhood nice.
[10310.14s -> 10312.14s]  He beat a bear in a fight, right?
[10312.14s -> 10314.14s]  Yes, I fought a bear in a fight.
[10314.14s -> 10316.14s]  There was a tornado and I got an organ.
[10316.14s -> 10318.14s]  I knew I liked you.
[10318.14s -> 10320.14s]  I really like you, but I didn't know you lived here.
[10320.14s -> 10322.14s]  I just live here. I was just walking by.
[10322.14s -> 10324.14s]  I don't mean to intrude or anything.
[10324.14s -> 10326.14s]  You were playing Battleship the other day.
[10326.14s -> 10328.14s]  You still owe me a lot from that.
[10328.14s -> 10330.14s]  I do. I have quite a few things.
[10330.14s -> 10332.14s]  I get to get in a shirt.
[10332.14s -> 10334.14s]  I get to do a thing in a shirt.
[10334.14s -> 10336.14s]  Milky Maids, 1500.
[10336.14s -> 10338.14s]  If you ever wanted to play again,
[10338.14s -> 10340.14s]  we could just sweep the debt.
[10340.14s -> 10344.24s]  Double or nothing.
[10344.24s -> 10346.24s]  Do you have another job here, by the way?
[10346.24s -> 10348.24s]  Do you work here in the town?
[10348.24s -> 10350.24s]  I'm a streamer.
[10350.24s -> 10352.24s]  Do you work here as anything else?
[10352.24s -> 10354.24s]  In this town?
[10354.24s -> 10356.24s]  Do you have houses or anything?
[10356.24s -> 10358.24s]  No.
[10358.24s -> 10360.24s]  Do you think my stream is not successful enough?
[10360.24s -> 10362.24s]  No.
[10362.24s -> 10364.24s]  I stream like a month in a row.
[10364.24s -> 10366.24s]  It was a long time.
[10366.24s -> 10368.24s]  I know.
[10368.24s -> 10370.24s]  It was crazy.
[10370.24s -> 10372.24s]  You don't do anything else in this town.
[10372.24s -> 10374.24s]  Again, I just stream.
[10374.24s -> 10376.24s]  Whatever. I won't even push it anymore.
[10378.24s -> 10380.24s]  You're talking about we could play what?
[10380.24s -> 10382.24s]  We could play Battleship?
[10382.24s -> 10385.38s]  Why do you have bread on the floor?
[10385.38s -> 10387.38s]  I'm supposed to have it made.
[10387.38s -> 10389.38s]  You just ate it out of the ground.
[10389.38s -> 10394.30s]  Should I follow you?
[10394.30s -> 10396.30s]  Come on in the other room.
[10398.30s -> 10400.30s]  Wow. This is your stream setup.
[10400.30s -> 10402.30s]  This is my setup, man. Check it out.
[10402.30s -> 10404.30s]  It's convenient to have two chairs for co-op.
[10404.30s -> 10406.30s]  I could look up.
[10406.30s -> 10408.30s]  You could watch me stream if you wanted to.
[10408.30s -> 10410.30s]  This is a good setup.
[10410.30s -> 10412.30s]  By the way, it's cleaned very well
[10412.30s -> 10414.30s]  from whoever that person happens to be
[10414.30s -> 10416.30s]  who cleans the house every so often.
[10416.30s -> 10418.30s]  Maid?
[10418.30s -> 10420.30s]  Is it a guy or a girl?
[10420.30s -> 10422.30s]  It's you.
[10422.30s -> 10424.30s]  It would be you.
[10424.30s -> 10426.30s]  I think it's you.
[10426.30s -> 10428.30s]  Do you want to co-op stream?
[10428.30s -> 10430.30s]  Sure, of course.
[10430.30s -> 10432.30s]  Do you want me to do your intro?
[10432.30s -> 10434.30s]  Sometimes I get nervous before a stream.
[10437.25s -> 10439.25s]  Let's start the stream.
[10439.25s -> 10441.74s]  What's up, suckers?
[10441.74s -> 10443.74s]  It's not live yet.
[10443.74s -> 10445.74s]  I'm nervous to do co-ops in person.
[10445.74s -> 10447.74s]  It won't go through.
[10447.74s -> 10449.74s]  I'm banned from Twitch.
[10449.74s -> 10451.74s]  Why did you get banned?
[10454.05s -> 10456.05s]  Do you see where I stream from?
[10458.05s -> 10460.05s]  This reminds me of another doctor streamer.
[10462.05s -> 10464.05s]  You can make it work.
[10464.05s -> 10466.05s]  I'm going to fall out of the thing.
[10470.54s -> 10472.54s]  This has been eye-opening, man.
[10472.54s -> 10474.54s]  I didn't know that you lived here.
[10474.54s -> 10476.54s]  I didn't know that you lived like this.
[10476.54s -> 10478.54s]  You've got to have your setup in a good place.
[10480.54s -> 10482.54s]  That's what I agree with.
[10482.54s -> 10484.54s]  I think we disagree on how you accomplish that.
[10486.54s -> 10488.54s]  I've got to shower, too.
[10488.54s -> 10490.54s]  I feel like that shouldn't be a thing you bring up.
[10492.54s -> 10495.36s]  It's assumed.
[10495.36s -> 10497.36s]  In case you need it to, it's there.
[10497.36s -> 10499.36s]  Homemade cookies.
[10499.36s -> 10501.36s]  There are cookies.
[10501.36s -> 10503.73s]  What do you got here?
[10503.73s -> 10507.63s]  You want to play?
[10507.63s -> 10509.63s]  No.
[10509.63s -> 10511.63s]  I've been waiting for your arrival for months.
[10511.63s -> 10513.63s]  I didn't even know you lived here.
[10513.63s -> 10515.63s]  I have Mickey...
[10515.63s -> 10517.63s]  Let's just say mouse.
[10517.63s -> 10519.63s]  Weird mouse cartoon gloves on.
[10519.63s -> 10521.63s]  Can you go ahead and open that for me?
[10521.63s -> 10523.63s]  I'll open it for you.
[10523.63s -> 10525.63s]  Let's get this moved out of the way.
[10525.63s -> 10527.63s]  Sorry, I've got to piss really bad.
[10527.63s -> 10529.63s]  You take your time. I'll set it up.
[10529.63s -> 10531.63s]  I don't have to go quite yet.
[10531.63s -> 10533.63s]  Bring it up to me.
[10533.63s -> 10535.63s]  Just in case you don't know in the future that I'm going to have to go eventually.
[10535.63s -> 10537.63s]  Thank you for the information.
[10537.63s -> 10539.63s]  I also will have to pee in the future.
[10539.63s -> 10541.63s]  There's a bathroom there, too.
[10541.63s -> 10543.63s]  I don't know when.
[10543.63s -> 10545.63s]  Should I set up your board for you?
[10545.63s -> 10547.63s]  I think you should because I can't touch it.
[10547.63s -> 10549.63s]  I made cookies with this woman.
[10549.63s -> 10551.63s]  Do you know Edna?
[10551.63s -> 10553.63s]  She lives down the street.
[10553.63s -> 10555.63s]  Isn't she great?
[10555.63s -> 10557.63s]  She's a cool chef, but she's a little weird, though.
[10557.63s -> 10559.63s]  Weird in a good way.
[10559.63s -> 10561.63s]  I got it for you.
[10561.63s -> 10563.63s]  I can't even touch that.
[10563.63s -> 10565.63s]  I think this is how it goes.
[10567.63s -> 10569.63s]  This looks much more complicated than I thought it was going to be.
[10569.63s -> 10571.63s]  You know what? I was thinking,
[10571.63s -> 10573.63s]  since you owe me about $500,
[10573.63s -> 10575.63s]  we could just do a simple...
[10575.63s -> 10577.63s]  You want to do two ships?
[10577.63s -> 10579.63s]  Two ships. Maybe even just one.
[10579.63s -> 10581.63s]  One ship.
[10581.63s -> 10583.63s]  Just a two-piece ship.
[10583.63s -> 10585.63s]  I can't get this other glove off because it's taped to my wrist.
[10585.63s -> 10587.63s]  You know what?
[10587.63s -> 10589.63s]  It's a great watch, though.
[10589.63s -> 10591.63s]  It is a really nice watch.
[10591.63s -> 10593.63s]  Am I flexing enough?
[10593.63s -> 10595.63s]  Do you know that I make pretty good money?
[10595.63s -> 10597.63s]  Do you know that I make good money?
[10597.63s -> 10599.63s]  I saw your last stream.
[10599.63s -> 10601.63s]  You missed a day.
[10601.63s -> 10603.63s]  Consistency is key.
[10603.63s -> 10605.63s]  You make great money.
[10605.63s -> 10607.63s]  I don't want you to see my screen.
[10607.63s -> 10609.63s]  Charming place.
[10609.63s -> 10611.63s]  I'm not cheating.
[10611.63s -> 10613.63s]  Just place one ship.
[10613.63s -> 10615.63s]  You're not looking, right?
[10615.63s -> 10619.09s]  I got my ship placed.
[10619.09s -> 10621.09s]  Do you have your ship placed?
[10621.09s -> 10623.09s]  I do.
[10623.09s -> 10625.09s]  Are you starting this off?
[10625.09s -> 10627.09s]  I'm going to say C5.
[10627.09s -> 10629.09s]  Just be so incorrect.
[10629.09s -> 10631.09s]  So incorrect.
[10631.09s -> 10633.78s]  It's a miss.
[10633.78s -> 10635.78s]  This is $500 on the line.
[10635.78s -> 10637.78s]  What are we doing with some money?
[10637.78s -> 10639.78s]  You owe me money. This is a double or nothing.
[10639.78s -> 10642.08s]  Are you okay with that?
[10642.08s -> 10644.08s]  You can make a lot.
[10644.08s -> 10646.08s]  I didn't even know you lived here.
[10646.08s -> 10648.08s]  C5 is a miss.
[10648.08s -> 10650.08s]  I will go with C5 as well.
[10650.08s -> 10653.98s]  You're doing C5?
[10653.98s -> 10655.98s]  I don't like the aesthetic here.
[10655.98s -> 10657.98s]  Can you scoot to your left by 3 or 4 inches?
[10657.98s -> 10659.98s]  There we go.
[10659.98s -> 10661.98s]  I like the aesthetic there a little more.
[10661.98s -> 10663.98s]  Is that a bit better?
[10663.98s -> 10665.98s]  That's a bit better to me.
[10665.98s -> 10667.98s]  It bothered me very much.
[10667.98s -> 10669.98s]  That's fair.
[10669.98s -> 10671.98s]  So you said C5?
[10671.98s -> 10673.98s]  Yeah, C5.
[10673.98s -> 10675.98s]  You can literally see me.
[10675.98s -> 10677.98s]  I'm going to say F7.
[10677.98s -> 10681.06s]  Incredibly incorrect.
[10681.06s -> 10683.06s]  Fine.
[10683.06s -> 10685.74s]  Where are you going?
[10685.74s -> 10689.74s]  Maybe something in the first column.
[10689.74s -> 10691.74s]  Well, you have to say something.
[10691.74s -> 10693.74s]  D?
[10693.74s -> 10696.24s]  Maybe C1?
[10696.24s -> 10698.24s]  C1 is a hit.
[10698.24s -> 10700.24s]  And you literally looked.
[10700.24s -> 10702.24s]  I moved to your left.
[10702.24s -> 10704.24s]  You asked me to move to my left.
[10704.24s -> 10706.24s]  I just happened to move to my left.
[10706.24s -> 10708.24s]  I'm just going to take a random stab in the dark, D1.
[10708.24s -> 10710.24s]  No.
[10710.24s -> 10712.24s]  What?
[10712.24s -> 10714.24s]  There's something on D1.
[10714.24s -> 10716.24s]  First of all, I want to do this real quick.
[10716.24s -> 10718.24s]  Don't move.
[10718.24s -> 10720.99s]  I want everyone to see what I have.
[10720.99s -> 10722.99s]  Show them what I have.
[10722.99s -> 10724.99s]  If you ever have to go to the bathroom and take a shower, feel free to.
[10724.99s -> 10726.99s]  That's where I am and he looked and it's bullshit.
[10726.99s -> 10728.99s]  I've never looked at anything in my life.
[10728.99s -> 10731.17s]  Call me a cheater?
[10731.17s -> 10733.17s]  Yes.
[10733.17s -> 10735.17s]  So when did you move here?
[10735.17s -> 10737.17s]  I moved to 983 Dollhouse Lane.
[10737.17s -> 10739.17s]  983 Dollhouse Lane.
[10739.17s -> 10741.17s]  I've been living in Dollhouse Lane for a while, actually.
[10741.17s -> 10743.17s]  I was with my mother.
[10743.17s -> 10745.17s]  I was friends with a man named Ted who passed recently.
[10745.17s -> 10748.18s]  Sad passing, too.
[10748.18s -> 10750.18s]  I came out of nowhere.
[10750.18s -> 10752.18s]  Blindsided us all.
[10752.18s -> 10754.18s]  You weren't there.
[10754.18s -> 10756.18s]  By the way, I had a funeral.
[10756.18s -> 10758.18s]  It was weird.
[10758.18s -> 10760.18s]  No, I wasn't.
[10760.18s -> 10762.18s]  I didn't think I had to be there.
[10762.18s -> 10764.18s]  Wasn't he your uncle or something?
[10764.18s -> 10766.18s]  They're just friends.
[10766.18s -> 10768.18s]  My mom is not related.
[10768.18s -> 10770.18s]  You and I are not related at all?
[10770.18s -> 10772.18s]  No, my mom's just friends with him.
[10772.18s -> 10774.18s]  I'm going to go F3.
[10774.18s -> 10776.18s]  F3 is just going to be a miss on your end.
[10776.18s -> 10778.18s]  That's fine.
[10778.18s -> 10781.38s]  You don't have to pee yet or anything, right?
[10781.38s -> 10783.38s]  I have had to pee for the last hour, but I'm just going to hold it.
[10783.38s -> 10785.38s]  I like talking to you.
[10785.38s -> 10787.38s]  Okay.
[10787.38s -> 10789.38s]  Let me go with E1.
[10789.38s -> 10791.38s]  E1 is incorrect.
[10791.38s -> 10793.38s]  You already said that last time.
[10793.38s -> 10795.38s]  No, I said D1.
[10795.38s -> 10797.38s]  Oh, well, you were wrong twice.
[10799.38s -> 10802.83s]  Where do you want to go instead?
[10802.83s -> 10804.83s]  You know what? I'll go D2.
[10804.83s -> 10806.83s]  D2? That is a miss.
[10806.83s -> 10808.83s]  You already have a hit.
[10808.83s -> 10810.83s]  Hold on, I've got to get this.
[10810.83s -> 10812.83s]  Yeah, take it.
[10812.83s -> 10818.64s]  Who is calling right now?
[10818.64s -> 10821.97s]  Hello? It's just static.
[10821.97s -> 10823.97s]  I don't know who this is.
[10823.97s -> 10831.44s]  Hello?
[10831.44s -> 10837.95s]  What the fuck?
[10837.95s -> 10839.95s]  It was a prank call.
[10839.95s -> 10841.95s]  It could have been a prank call.
[10841.95s -> 10843.95s]  Since we haven't gotten a response, we're giving you...
[10843.95s -> 10846.58s]  Hold on, somebody's there.
[10846.58s -> 10848.58s]  A final courtesy call.
[10848.58s -> 10850.58s]  Before we close out your file,
[10850.58s -> 10852.58s]  I wanted to see if you were available to talk
[10852.58s -> 10854.58s]  for a few minutes.
[10854.58s -> 10856.58s]  If you'd like to speak to a specialist
[10856.58s -> 10858.58s]  concerning extending
[10858.58s -> 10860.58s]  or reinstating your vehicle's warranty,
[10860.58s -> 10862.58s]  press 1 right now
[10862.58s -> 10864.58s]  to speak to a warranty specialist.
[10864.58s -> 10866.58s]  I'd like for you to put me on the do not call list.
[10866.58s -> 10868.58s]  Put me on the do not call list ever again.
[10868.58s -> 10870.58s]  I don't know what that means.
[10870.58s -> 10872.58s]  You're going to put me in a database of people
[10872.58s -> 10874.58s]  that answered the phone,
[10874.58s -> 10876.58s]  so therefore I'm going to get ten times more phone calls.
[10876.58s -> 10878.58s]  The real play is for me to never actually answer the phone.
[10878.58s -> 10880.58s]  Because if I answer the phone, that means they have me
[10880.58s -> 10882.58s]  in the database of people that answered the phone,
[10882.58s -> 10884.58s]  so therefore I'll get more.
[10884.58s -> 10887.14s]  Have a good day. Fuck you.
[10887.14s -> 10889.14s]  What was your move?
[10889.14s -> 10891.14s]  It was C4,
[10891.14s -> 10893.14s]  like the explosive.
[10893.14s -> 10895.14s]  That's a hit.
[10895.14s -> 10897.14s]  C3.
[10897.14s -> 10899.14s]  That's a hit.
[10899.14s -> 10901.14s]  C2.
[10901.14s -> 10903.14s]  That's a hit. You won again.
[10903.14s -> 10905.57s]  I have to pay you $500.
[10905.57s -> 10907.57s]  That's $500.
[10907.57s -> 10909.57s]  This is just for fun.
[10909.57s -> 10911.57s]  That's just for fun.
[10911.57s -> 10913.57s]  That's literally just for fun.
[10913.57s -> 10915.57s]  I guessed it correctly.
[10915.57s -> 10917.57s]  You guessed it correctly, but you didn't even...
[10917.57s -> 10919.94s]  Hold on.
[10919.94s -> 10921.94s]  Sorry, I've just really got to go to the bathroom.
[10921.94s -> 10923.94s]  Yeah, take your time.
[10923.94s -> 10925.94s]  Take your time.
[10925.94s -> 10928.30s]  Well, I can't go yet.
[10928.30s -> 10930.30s]  But I have to go.
[10930.30s -> 10932.93s]  I didn't think it'd be like this when we hung out.
[10932.93s -> 10934.93s]  I didn't even know you lived here. I thought you lived somewhere.
[10934.93s -> 10936.93s]  I don't know you lived here.
[10936.93s -> 10938.93s]  I've always lived in Dollhouse.
[10938.93s -> 10940.93s]  You walked over and I was doing my thing, playing the organ,
[10940.93s -> 10942.93s]  and I didn't know you were here.
[10942.93s -> 10944.93s]  Who are those fucking weirdos, by the way? Is it police?
[10944.93s -> 10946.93s]  It's the police. There's been a bear on the loose.
[10946.93s -> 10948.93s]  Have you had a bear in your house?
[10948.93s -> 10950.93s]  Well, before, yeah.
[10950.93s -> 10952.93s]  You've had a bear come to your front door?
[10952.93s -> 10954.93s]  What else would you do?
[10954.93s -> 10956.93s]  That's what I fucking...
[10956.93s -> 10958.93s]  What would you do?
[10958.93s -> 10960.93s]  I would call the police. But I fought him.
[10960.93s -> 10962.93s]  And I kicked his ass.
[10962.93s -> 10964.93s]  And then he kicked my ass.
[10964.93s -> 10966.93s]  You fought the bear?
[10966.93s -> 10968.93s]  Yeah, I kicked his ass.
[10968.93s -> 10970.93s]  Why would you fight a bear?
[10970.93s -> 10972.93s]  I can't believe this.
[10972.93s -> 10974.93s]  You're saying it with a tone that makes me think you might not...
[10974.93s -> 10976.93s]  I'll be right back.
[10976.93s -> 10978.93s]  Take your time.
[10978.93s -> 10980.93s]  Just hang out this food in the fridge.
[10980.93s -> 10995.06s]  He's so bad.
[10995.06s -> 10997.42s]  Ludwig is in my house right now.
[10997.42s -> 10999.42s]  He's awesome.
[10999.42s -> 11001.42s]  He's a huge streamer. He's fucking really funny and shit.
[11001.42s -> 11003.98s]  I wasn't prepared for this.
[11003.98s -> 11008.96s]  I got a piece so fucking bad,
[11008.96s -> 11016.51s]  you have no idea.
[11016.51s -> 11020.16s]  Please, help me.
[11020.16s -> 11024.00s]  I'll do anything. I really will.
[11024.00s -> 11029.38s]  Please let me go to the bathroom.
[11029.38s -> 11032.38s]  Hey!
[11032.38s -> 11034.38s]  Hey!
[11034.38s -> 11036.38s]  How are you? I'm doing good.
[11036.38s -> 11038.38s]  Yay! Cool!
[11038.38s -> 11040.38s]  He's doing good. Awesome.
[11040.38s -> 11042.38s]  How are you doing?
[11042.38s -> 11044.38s]  I'm doing great. It's good to have you here, man.
[11044.38s -> 11046.38s]  It's really good to have you here.
[11046.38s -> 11048.38s]  You seem on edge.
[11048.38s -> 11050.38s]  You want something to drink?
[11050.38s -> 11052.38s]  No, I'm fine.
[11052.38s -> 11075.47s]  Ludwig!
[11075.47s -> 11077.47s]  I got a stereo in here.
[11077.47s -> 11079.47s]  I'm listening to weird music.
[11079.47s -> 11085.42s]  I get that.
[11085.42s -> 11087.42s]  I listen to drum solos.
[11087.42s -> 11089.42s]  It kind of feels like you're trying to drum over the sound of your shitting,
[11089.42s -> 11091.42s]  but that makes sense too.
[11091.42s -> 11093.42s]  Drum solos.
[11093.42s -> 11095.66s]  Why is the paper this far away?
[11095.66s -> 11097.66s]  Why would the paper be over here?
[11103.66s -> 11105.66s]  This guy's a bit of a psycho.
[11105.66s -> 11111.04s]  Thank God.
[11111.04s -> 11114.69s]  That paper is like three feet away.
[11114.69s -> 11124.61s]  Oh yeah.
[11124.61s -> 11133.81s]  Hands washed!
[11133.81s -> 11135.81s]  Ludwig, how are you?
[11135.81s -> 11137.81s]  How are you doing?
[11137.81s -> 11139.81s]  You've done this a couple times.
[11139.81s -> 11141.81s]  Hey, I don't want to stay too long.
[11141.81s -> 11143.81s]  It seems like you've got a lot of shit going on.
[11143.81s -> 11145.81s]  No, not really.
[11145.81s -> 11147.81s]  Just a few things.
[11147.81s -> 11149.81s]  But I'm really happy you came over. I hope you like the place.
[11149.81s -> 11153.01s]  It's cool.
[11153.01s -> 11155.01s]  It's all right.
[11155.01s -> 11157.01s]  It's a low mortgage.
[11157.01s -> 11159.01s]  I got it on a good deal.
[11159.01s -> 11161.01s]  You got a beer?
[11161.01s -> 11163.01s]  Yeah.
[11163.01s -> 11165.01s]  Is that okay?
[11165.01s -> 11167.01s]  I'm just going to help myself.
[11167.01s -> 11169.01s]  It's cool, man.
[11169.01s -> 11171.31s]  I don't want to...
[11171.31s -> 11173.31s]  It's all good, man.
[11173.31s -> 11175.31s]  Sometimes I just got to get some blood pumping.
[11175.31s -> 11177.31s]  Sorry.
[11177.31s -> 11180.00s]  Do I do it with you?
[11180.00s -> 11182.00s]  You can if you want to.
[11182.00s -> 11184.00s]  Sometimes I just feel like doing it
[11184.00s -> 11186.00s]  because I feel like I've got to get some blood going in my body.
[11186.00s -> 11188.00s]  Maybe you could move this
[11188.00s -> 11190.00s]  to not be in the middle.
[11190.00s -> 11192.00s]  That would be a workout.
[11192.00s -> 11194.00s]  I can't get swole that way.
[11194.00s -> 11196.00s]  That makes a lot of sense.
[11196.00s -> 11198.00s]  Hey, it's been a pleasure.
[11198.00s -> 11200.00s]  Thanks for the money.
[11200.00s -> 11202.00s]  How many times do I have to pay you every time I see you?
[11202.00s -> 11204.00s]  Don't want to be too forward.
[11204.00s -> 11206.00s]  Maybe it's worth getting a maid around these parts.
[11206.00s -> 11208.00s]  I know.
[11208.00s -> 11210.00s]  I thought about that.
[11210.00s -> 11212.00s]  Weirdly enough, though.
[11212.00s -> 11214.00s]  Maids are like two grand around here.
[11214.00s -> 11216.00s]  Well, the sexy ones, but you're not a perv.
[11216.00s -> 11218.00s]  You wouldn't get those ones.
[11218.00s -> 11220.00s]  Those are the maids that are like happy ending maids.
[11220.00s -> 11222.00s]  Two grand, though. It's a little high.
[11222.00s -> 11224.00s]  Well, it's a good ending.
[11224.00s -> 11226.00s]  End of Code Geass levels.
[11226.00s -> 11228.00s]  It's a little high.
[11228.00s -> 11230.00s]  It's a little high.
[11230.00s -> 11232.00s]  You okay?
[11232.00s -> 11234.00s]  Yeah, I'm fine.
[11234.00s -> 11236.00s]  I'm just getting my socks on.
[11236.00s -> 11238.00s]  I'll just see myself out.
[11238.00s -> 11240.00s]  I'll just get my socks on.
[11240.00s -> 11242.00s]  It was great seeing you.
[11242.00s -> 11244.00s]  I'll call you.
[11244.00s -> 11246.00s]  I'll just get my socks on.
[11246.00s -> 11248.00s]  This guy's a fucking psycho.
[11250.00s -> 11261.82s]  I can't sleep.
[11261.82s -> 11267.44s]  Why?
[11267.44s -> 11269.44s]  That was so fucking embarrassing.
[11269.44s -> 11272.51s]  He's really cool.
[11272.51s -> 11274.51s]  You literally just brought in...
[11274.51s -> 11276.51s]  That's one of the coolest dudes I know.
[11276.51s -> 11279.20s]  I'm trying to sleep.
[11279.20s -> 11281.20s]  I'm so tired, but I can't.
[11281.20s -> 11285.87s]  Why?
[11285.87s -> 11288.30s]  Why can't I sleep?
[11288.30s -> 11291.06s]  I don't get it.
[11291.06s -> 11818.34s]  I don't...
[11818.34s -> 11823.63s]  It's raining. It's really raining.
[11823.63s -> 11825.63s]  It's like loud rain.
[11825.63s -> 11830.05s]  It's like a thunderstorm.
[11830.05s -> 11834.72s]  Oh, whoa!
[11834.72s -> 11836.96s]  Whoa!
[11836.96s -> 11839.52s]  Whoa! TV!
[11839.52s -> 11841.52s]  TV!
[11841.52s -> 11848.99s]  Does it work?
[11848.99s -> 11853.60s]  TV?
[11853.60s -> 11859.42s]  How do I turn it on?
[11859.42s -> 11863.18s]  Holy shit!
[11863.18s -> 11865.18s]  A TV!
[11865.18s -> 11872.27s]  If I can turn it on.
[11872.27s -> 11874.27s]  Where is it?
[11874.27s -> 11876.27s]  Where is the TV?
[11876.27s -> 11878.27s]  How do I turn it on?
[11878.27s -> 11880.96s]  The rain is so loud.
[11880.96s -> 11883.33s]  TV!
[11883.33s -> 11886.91s]  Oh, whoa!
[11886.91s -> 11889.47s]  Wow!
[11889.47s -> 11895.94s]  TV!
[11895.94s -> 11897.94s]  How do I turn the TV off?
[11897.94s -> 11900.18s]  Oh, cool!
[11900.18s -> 11902.18s]  TV!
[11902.18s -> 11904.86s]  Wow!
[11904.86s -> 11907.68s]  Oh my god!
[11907.68s -> 11910.05s]  TV!
[11910.05s -> 11913.38s]  TV!
[11913.38s -> 11915.38s]  Oh, wow! TV!
[11915.38s -> 11925.23s]  TV!
[11925.23s -> 11928.43s]  That shit's fucked.
[11928.43s -> 11931.50s]  Oh!
[11931.50s -> 11933.50s]  Why don't we watch some TV?
[11933.50s -> 11936.13s]  Ah, the beautiful
[11936.13s -> 11938.75s]  rainstorm.
[11938.75s -> 11942.40s]  Take a look outside.
[11942.40s -> 11945.22s]  Wow!
[11945.22s -> 11947.90s]  It's coming down out there.
[11947.90s -> 11950.14s]  Holy smokes!
[11950.14s -> 11969.34s]  Time to stream.
[11969.34s -> 11976.19s]  Let's get some stream going here.
[11976.19s -> 11978.19s]  Alright, going live.
[11978.19s -> 11981.90s]  Come check me out.
[11981.90s -> 11987.02s]  And live.
[11987.02s -> 11989.02s]  Hey guys, just started the stream.
[11989.02s -> 11993.25s]  But before I get started, let's run some ads.
[11993.25s -> 12293.47s]  No, I don't see it.
[12293.47s -> 12296.99s]  It's not on the screen.
[12296.99s -> 12301.54s]  That's what you're saying. Thanks for the subs.
[12301.54s -> 12303.54s]  Appreciate it. It's not there though.
[12303.54s -> 12310.51s]  I'm not blind. I can't see it.
[12310.51s -> 12313.84s]  There's nothing there.
[12313.84s -> 12315.84s]  There's nothing on the screen.
[12315.84s -> 12317.84s]  I've turned around four times now, okay?
[12317.84s -> 12320.02s]  It's not there.
[12320.02s -> 12322.38s]  Stop fucking with me.
[12322.38s -> 12324.38s]  I'm just getting like gas lit. That's all you guys fucking do.
[12324.38s -> 12330.78s]  I don't know if that's somebody's
[12330.78s -> 12332.78s]  officer's, police officer's driving by or something.
[12332.78s -> 12341.54s]  Yeah.
[12341.54s -> 12345.38s]  That was a siren.
[12345.38s -> 12351.20s]  I don't know if that's a main road. It's a busy road.
[12351.20s -> 12357.09s]  Yeah, I got it.
[12357.09s -> 12359.09s]  Ring the doorbell or something.
[12359.09s -> 12361.09s]  Ring the doorbell.
[12361.09s -> 12363.33s]  It's hard to do. I'm freaking blind.
[12363.33s -> 12365.33s]  Can you knock it a couple times?
[12365.33s -> 12367.33s]  Do something, okay?
[12367.33s -> 12369.33s]  I'm freaking blind.
[12369.33s -> 12371.33s]  I'm pretty sure this is the right place.
[12371.33s -> 12375.87s]  Alright, let me show you how it's done, alright?
[12375.87s -> 12377.87s]  Hey, listen.
[12377.87s -> 12379.87s]  This is Sheriff Tony Andrews, I believe we met.
[12379.87s -> 12381.87s]  Yeah, we have.
[12381.87s -> 12383.87s]  We have a stolen TV in the area.
[12383.87s -> 12385.87s]  And the GPS tracking device is showing right here.
[12385.87s -> 12387.87s]  Yeah, the GPS tracking device.
[12387.87s -> 12389.87s]  What's that?
[12389.87s -> 12391.87s]  It's raining.
[12391.87s -> 12393.87s]  Interesting.
[12393.87s -> 12395.87s]  Listen, you're going to have to let us in here, okay?
[12395.87s -> 12397.87s]  We've got to inspect the area.
[12397.87s -> 12399.87s]  It's raining, can you see that?
[12399.87s -> 12401.87s]  Wait, is it raining right here?
[12401.87s -> 12403.87s]  I'm perfectly fine.
[12403.87s -> 12405.87s]  Yeah, that's a stolen what?
[12405.87s -> 12407.87s]  Yeah, you see that stolen TV?
[12407.87s -> 12409.87s]  My GPS says it's right at this location, right?
[12409.87s -> 12411.87s]  How do you have a GPS on a stolen TV?
[12411.87s -> 12413.87s]  Everything has tracking devices.
[12413.87s -> 12415.87s]  We've got to go in here, we've got to go in here.
[12415.87s -> 12417.87s]  Do I seriously go inside, dude?
[12417.87s -> 12419.87s]  Who is this guy?
[12419.87s -> 12421.87s]  He's a serial jaywalker.
[12421.87s -> 12423.87s]  I caught him loitering outside the library a couple minutes ago.
[12423.87s -> 12426.62s]  Listen, dude, you can just call me Snakebite.
[12426.62s -> 12428.62s]  Why are you bringing him in my house?
[12428.62s -> 12431.57s]  What's that?
[12431.57s -> 12434.32s]  It's a TV.
[12434.32s -> 12436.32s]  You see that red dot?
[12436.32s -> 12440.54s]  Yeah.
[12440.54s -> 12442.54s]  You see that TV?
[12442.54s -> 12444.54s]  I got it from second hand, it was second hand.
[12444.54s -> 12446.54s]  And where'd you get it?
[12446.54s -> 12448.54s]  I got it from, it was brought to me by some sleep paralysis demons in the night.
[12448.54s -> 12450.54s]  Sleep paralysis demons?
[12450.54s -> 12452.54s]  Yeah, okay.
[12452.54s -> 12454.54s]  Tell me more about your sleep paralysis demons.
[12454.54s -> 12456.54s]  You got any sleep paralysis demons?
[12456.54s -> 12458.54s]  Sleep paralysis, dude?
[12458.54s -> 12460.54s]  It's going down out there, you hear that?
[12460.54s -> 12462.54s]  Yeah, I don't know what you're...
[12462.54s -> 12464.54s]  He's crazy.
[12464.54s -> 12466.54s]  You're a psycho, you know that?
[12466.54s -> 12468.54s]  You think it's raining, you got sleep paralysis demons?
[12468.54s -> 12470.54s]  What do you want to do about the TV?
[12470.54s -> 12472.54s]  Let me ask you something.
[12472.54s -> 12474.54s]  You see that red dot?
[12474.54s -> 12477.04s]  You think that's that TV right there?
[12477.04s -> 12479.73s]  Officer, I don't want a criminal
[12479.73s -> 12481.73s]  just in my house.
[12481.73s -> 12483.73s]  He hasn't officially been arrested yet.
[12483.73s -> 12485.73s]  There's a whole other story.
[12485.73s -> 12487.73s]  This is boring.
[12487.73s -> 12489.73s]  Hold my phone.
[12489.73s -> 12491.73s]  Dude, this is crazy, man.
[12491.73s -> 12493.73s]  Let me just double check something, okay?
[12493.73s -> 12495.73s]  You can look if you want, I don't think there's anything wrong.
[12495.73s -> 12499.63s]  I mean, the TV doesn't work, it broke.
[12499.63s -> 12501.63s]  Yeah, that's the exact serial number with the GPS.
[12501.63s -> 12503.63s]  I didn't buy it, somebody bought it for me.
[12503.63s -> 12505.63s]  It came in here, sleep paralysis demons
[12505.63s -> 12507.63s]  bring shit to me and it takes my name away from my account.
[12507.63s -> 12509.63s]  Do me a favor.
[12509.63s -> 12511.63s]  I'm going to need you to help me pick this up, alright?
[12511.63s -> 12513.63s]  I'm sorry, sir, this is stolen property.
[12513.63s -> 12515.63s]  Unless you want me to...
[12515.63s -> 12518.45s]  You want me to arrest you?
[12518.45s -> 12520.45s]  This is your choice.
[12520.45s -> 12522.45s]  Okay, listen, you want him to take the TV?
[12522.45s -> 12524.45s]  I don't want anyone to take my TV.
[12524.45s -> 12526.45s]  This is my TV, it was brought to me by sleep paralysis demons
[12526.45s -> 12528.45s]  and it gave me the night time
[12528.45s -> 12530.45s]  and they drop shit and they touch my head sometimes.
[12530.45s -> 12532.45s]  They touch your head sometimes?
[12532.45s -> 12534.45s]  By the way, can I just tell you?
[12534.45s -> 12536.45s]  Yeah, what do you want?
[12536.45s -> 12538.45s]  You are probably, I would say,
[12538.45s -> 12540.45s]  probably the most handsome police officer I've ever seen.
[12540.45s -> 12542.45s]  You're aware this is like another dude here, right?
[12542.45s -> 12544.45s]  Like I'm a person, dude.
[12544.45s -> 12546.45s]  I'm sorry, I just...
[12546.45s -> 12548.45s]  The outfit, the uniform...
[12548.45s -> 12550.45s]  I really appreciate that, my mother always told me
[12550.45s -> 12552.45s]  I look good in blue.
[12552.45s -> 12554.45s]  You do look fantastic.
[12554.45s -> 12556.45s]  It's the blue, it's the double blue.
[12556.45s -> 12558.45s]  Listen, maybe we should grab a beer sometime.
[12558.45s -> 12560.45s]  I would absolutely love that.
[12560.45s -> 12562.45s]  I would absolutely love going out for a beer.
[12562.45s -> 12564.45s]  Hey, where'd you put my phone?
[12564.45s -> 12566.45s]  It's in my hands, bro, you made me hold it for you, dude.
[12566.45s -> 12568.45s]  Listen, here's the thing,
[12568.45s -> 12570.45s]  I can either find you for $300...
[12570.45s -> 12572.45s]  Don't find me.
[12572.45s -> 12574.45s]  ...and I can say that maybe I didn't see the TV.
[12574.45s -> 12576.45s]  I don't know, but listen, man,
[12576.45s -> 12578.45s]  I'm gonna take the TV either way.
[12578.45s -> 12581.78s]  Well, guess what, officer?
[12581.78s -> 12584.53s]  The TV doesn't fucking work.
[12584.53s -> 12586.53s]  It doesn't work.
[12586.53s -> 12588.53s]  So you broke it?
[12588.53s -> 12590.53s]  You broke the TV.
[12590.53s -> 12592.53s]  You stole the TV and you broke it.
[12592.53s -> 12594.53s]  I just wanted to watch the sports program on it
[12594.53s -> 12596.53s]  and it didn't work.
[12596.53s -> 12598.53s]  It looks like it works a little bit, dude.
[12598.53s -> 12600.53s]  It's just kind of abstract, man.
[12600.53s -> 12602.53s]  You want me to hang this on the wall
[12602.53s -> 12604.53s]  and make it an abstract art painting?
[12604.53s -> 12606.53s]  I'm sorry, you're gonna have to keep your hands
[12606.53s -> 12608.53s]  off the contraband, alright?
[12608.53s -> 12610.53s]  Listen, I'm gonna have to confiscate it.
[12610.53s -> 12612.53s]  We're taking it.
[12612.53s -> 12614.53s]  You go ahead and lift that up for me.
[12614.53s -> 12616.53s]  You expect me to pick up the freaking TV?
[12616.53s -> 12618.53s]  It's part of your community service, son.
[12618.53s -> 12620.53s]  Really?
[12620.53s -> 12622.53s]  Go ahead.
[12622.53s -> 12624.53s]  Good luck.
[12624.53s -> 12626.53s]  Thank you, by the way. Thank you. Appreciate it.
[12626.53s -> 12628.53s]  By the way, like I've got to say before,
[12628.53s -> 12630.53s]  I've said it before again,
[12630.53s -> 12632.53s]  probably the most handsome cop I've ever seen in my life.
[12632.53s -> 12634.53s]  Can we not address the fact that I'm walking backwards?
[12634.53s -> 12636.53s]  Can you pick up the pace a little bit, please?
[12636.53s -> 12638.53s]  Dude, I'm literally going as fast as I can.
[12638.53s -> 12640.53s]  Watch out for the couch.
[12640.53s -> 12642.53s]  Dude, we've got cables all over here.
[12642.53s -> 12644.53s]  This is a major safety risk, dude.
[12644.53s -> 12646.53s]  This is a real jaywalk.
[12646.53s -> 12648.53s]  There's no crosswalk in front of the library, dude.
[12648.53s -> 12650.53s]  What am I supposed to do?
[12650.53s -> 12652.53s]  I've got to get around you for a second.
[12652.53s -> 12654.53s]  Okay, alright.
[12654.53s -> 12656.53s]  Official police business, huh?
[12656.53s -> 12658.53s]  Official police business.
[12658.53s -> 12660.53s]  Dude, this is ridiculous, bro.
[12660.53s -> 12662.53s]  This is silly.
[12662.53s -> 12664.53s]  Can you get a load of that?
[12664.53s -> 12666.53s]  Who is Sleed Peralis, the demon?
[12666.53s -> 12668.53s]  I've never heard of that before, dude.
[12668.53s -> 12670.53s]  Put the TV down for a second.
[12670.53s -> 12672.53s]  Put the TV down for a second.
[12672.53s -> 12674.53s]  Go have a good day, go ahead and take it.
[12674.53s -> 12676.53s]  I'm not paying to find you.
[12676.53s -> 12678.53s]  I don't know if you've heard of Tic-Tac or whatever.
[12678.53s -> 12680.53s]  Don't Tick-Tock me!
[12680.53s -> 12682.53s]  If you're going to Tick-Tock me, fine.
[12682.53s -> 12684.53s]  Are you Tick-Tocking?
[12684.53s -> 12686.53s]  Are you Tick-Tocking now?
[12686.53s -> 12692.74s]  Yeah, I think so. I don't know how it works.
[12692.74s -> 12695.55s]  There, fucking leave, please.
[12695.55s -> 12697.55s]  Alright.
[12697.55s -> 12699.55s]  And I'm the one in handcuffs, bro?
[12699.55s -> 12701.55s]  I'm the one getting arrested?
[12701.55s -> 12703.55s]  You made me watch that.
[12703.55s -> 12705.79s]  Okay.
[12705.79s -> 12707.79s]  This is ridiculous, dude. How far are we carrying this, man?
[12707.79s -> 12709.79s]  Another couple miles, man.
[12709.79s -> 12711.79s]  Another couple miles, bro, dude.
[12711.79s -> 12715.63s]  Now I don't have TV.
[12715.63s -> 12718.26s]  And I smell so awful
[12718.26s -> 12720.26s]  to a point where it's disgusting people.
[12720.26s -> 12724.29s]  And now I don't have TV.
[12724.29s -> 12726.29s]  Why would you get a stolen TV?
[12726.29s -> 12728.29s]  Why? You had so many options.
[12728.29s -> 12730.29s]  Why pick a stolen piece of merchandise?
[12730.29s -> 12732.29s]  And I plugged it in and it didn't work.
[12732.29s -> 12739.63s]  Unbelievable.
[12739.63s -> 12741.63s]  Oh shit, I'm still streaming.
[12741.63s -> 12743.63s]  Hey.
[12743.63s -> 12745.63s]  If anybody's still here.
[12745.63s -> 12747.63s]  Hey.
[12747.63s -> 12749.63s]  So I just had, hey everybody, what's going on?
[12749.63s -> 12751.63s]  Just had a little bit of thing going on.
[12751.63s -> 12753.63s]  Had my TV worked on. Had a handyman come.
[12753.63s -> 12755.63s]  You know, I was trying to get like
[12755.63s -> 12757.63s]  an ultra HD
[12757.63s -> 12759.63s]  screen put into the wall.
[12759.63s -> 12761.63s]  Because you know what I mean? Money.
[12761.63s -> 12763.63s]  I got a lot of it. So ultra HD
[12763.63s -> 12765.63s]  screen going into the wall back there.
[12765.63s -> 12767.63s]  Right in front of the kitchen, too.
[12767.63s -> 12769.63s]  I've got money, you know. I've got money.
[12769.63s -> 12772.38s]  I've got, mute the stream.
[12772.38s -> 12774.38s]  Mute it. I'll be right back.
[12774.38s -> 12786.66s]  Oy yi yi.
[12786.66s -> 12790.24s]  What a pain in the ass. I gotta
[12790.24s -> 12792.80s]  I gotta move.
[12792.80s -> 12796.32s]  This neighborhood is fucked.
[12796.32s -> 12798.32s]  This most ridiculous neighborhood. What an insane
[12798.32s -> 12801.07s]  neighborhood. It's eight.
[12801.07s -> 12808.05s]  I mean, I thought I was a weird guy.
[12808.05s -> 12810.48s]  Do I belong here or should I leave
[12810.48s -> 12820.21s]  here as fast as I can?
[12820.21s -> 12823.41s]  Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[12823.41s -> 12828.53s]  Hey everybody, I'm back.
[12828.53s -> 12831.15s]  I gotta go. I know you've only gotten
[12831.15s -> 12833.15s]  about four minutes of content.
[12833.15s -> 12835.15s]  And like a 62 minute BRB
[12835.15s -> 12837.15s]  screen.
[12837.15s -> 12839.15s]  But, you know, I just
[12839.15s -> 12841.15s]  I'm working on some stuff.
[12841.15s -> 12843.15s]  Make sure to check out tomorrow. There's gonna be
[12843.15s -> 12845.15s]  a dollhouse stream tomorrow.
[12845.15s -> 12847.15s]  I will check it out with you. We've got a lot of work done on it.
[12847.15s -> 12849.15s]  A lot of people were involved. It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[12849.15s -> 12851.15s]  So I'll give you guys a link
[12851.15s -> 12853.15s]  now. I'll give you the link.
[12853.15s -> 12855.39s]  Just send it in. Well, you're here
[12855.39s -> 12857.39s]  already, so that's fine. And I'll see
[12857.39s -> 12859.39s]  you guys tomorrow for the dollhouse stream.
[12859.39s -> 12863.04s]  And goodbye.
[12863.04s -> 12865.98s]  Play the outro. There it is.
[12865.98s -> 12869.25s]  Okay.
[12869.25s -> 12871.42s]  I hate doing this.
[12871.42s -> 12873.42s]  I hate streaming. I fucking can't wait till I'm done.
[12873.42s -> 12875.79s]  Is somebody calling?
[12875.79s -> 12885.95s]  Hello?
[12902.51s -> 12904.51s]  Hello?
[12904.51s -> 12906.51s]  Hello?
[12906.51s -> 12908.51s]  Hello?
[12908.51s -> 12910.51s]  Hello?
[12910.51s -> 12912.51s]  Hello?
[12912.51s -> 12914.51s]  Hello?
[12914.51s -> 12916.51s]  Hello?
[12916.51s -> 12918.51s]  Hello?
[12918.51s -> 12920.51s]  Hello?
[12920.51s -> 12922.51s]  Hello?
[12922.51s -> 12924.51s]  Hello?
[12924.51s -> 12926.51s]  Hello?
[12926.51s -> 12928.51s]  Hello?
[12928.51s -> 12930.51s]  Hello?
[12930.51s -> 12933.07s]  Oh, hang on.
[12933.07s -> 12935.07s]  Does that shit work on people? I don't understand.
[12935.07s -> 12938.66s]  Car warranty?
[12938.66s -> 12940.66s]  I don't have a car.
[12940.66s -> 12942.66s]  I literally don't have a car. I don't own a car.
[12942.66s -> 12944.66s]  How would a car get here?
[12944.66s -> 12950.80s]  I was just in there and I didn't go to the bathroom.
[12950.80s -> 12954.38s]  This place is a mess.
[12954.38s -> 12957.46s]  Disaster.
[12957.46s -> 12959.46s]  TV's gone.
[12959.46s -> 12961.46s]  My friends think I'm a weirdo.
[12961.46s -> 12963.46s]  I barely have anybody I can fucking hang out with.
[12963.46s -> 12966.91s]  What an absolute
[12966.91s -> 12976.58s]  disaster this has been.
[12976.58s -> 12978.58s]  What I'm going to need is I'm going to need the audience to give me some more volume.
[12978.58s -> 12980.58s]  That's what I'm going to need. I'm going to need more volume.
[12980.58s -> 12984.03s]  I need the audience to give me volume
[12984.03s -> 12986.03s]  to let me know what they want to do.
[12986.03s -> 12998.69s]  I thought this was going to be easy.
[12998.69s -> 13003.23s]  I thought this was going to be simple.
[13003.23s -> 13006.11s]  I thought I was going to be able to live here
[13006.11s -> 13008.11s]  uninterrupted, undisturbed.
[13008.11s -> 13010.54s]  That I'd be taken care of by
[13010.54s -> 13013.10s]  600 million people
[13013.10s -> 13015.10s]  watching, you know. There's 600 million people
[13015.10s -> 13017.10s]  here. You're making me look bad.
[13017.10s -> 13027.09s]  I do love this though.
[13027.09s -> 13031.06s]  It's a good touch.
[13031.06s -> 13033.06s]  I'm going to have somebody sit in here with you in the bathroom.
[13035.06s -> 13039.66s]  Alright, finally. I'm hungry.
[13039.66s -> 13041.66s]  This is out of the way.
[13041.66s -> 13043.66s]  I'm trying like an extension cord.
[13043.66s -> 13045.66s]  For the TV that I can't use.
[13045.66s -> 13048.54s]  That's great. What do we got?
[13048.54s -> 13051.04s]  We got beer that people keep
[13051.04s -> 13054.69s]  drinking. You know what?
[13054.69s -> 13061.79s]  I think I'm going to go for a slice of bread.
[13061.79s -> 13070.11s]  Or a cookie sandwich.
[13070.11s -> 13082.26s]  Don't put flash
[13082.26s -> 13086.35s]  on the stove, kids.
[13086.35s -> 13090.32s]  Is there blood on this? No.
[13090.32s -> 13096.21s]  You want to see how dirty these are
[13096.21s -> 13098.21s]  over the last like 3 or 4 hours?
[13098.21s -> 13102.86s]  Look at this. It's like I literally was walking
[13102.86s -> 13104.86s]  around in mud.
[13104.86s -> 13113.49s]  These were white.
[13113.49s -> 13115.49s]  I do have to go to the bathroom.
[13115.49s -> 13117.86s]  And I'm tired.
[13117.86s -> 13122.19s]  Very tired.
[13122.19s -> 13124.19s]  Can I sleep in the bed tonight or are we going to make me
[13124.19s -> 13126.19s]  pass out on the toilet while I take a shit and then
[13126.19s -> 13129.65s]  pass out and slash my head on the ground?
[13129.65s -> 13132.21s]  Can we make this a normal day?
[13132.21s -> 13134.83s]  Huh? Huh?
[13134.83s -> 13136.83s]  Normal day. Normal day.
[13136.83s -> 13139.14s]  Bars full.
[13139.14s -> 13143.17s]  I want to go to bed, I want to pee
[13143.17s -> 13145.17s]  and then I want to go to bed. Can we make that happen
[13145.17s -> 13150.86s]  please? Can we?
[13150.86s -> 13153.68s]  I'm trying so hard to not have my arms go up
[13153.68s -> 13155.68s]  because I don't want to see my armpit hairs.
[13155.68s -> 13157.68s]  Because somebody is going to screenshot it and like
[13157.68s -> 13159.68s]  keep it. I don't want you to have that.
[13159.68s -> 13163.33s]  I'm going to the bedroom.
[13163.33s -> 13176.70s]  All I have in my third room
[13176.70s -> 13178.70s]  is like
[13178.70s -> 13180.70s]  stools and a bed.
[13180.70s -> 13183.71s]  I mean the organs out there
[13183.71s -> 13185.71s]  and that's pretty cool. I'm going to go back and play that.
[13185.71s -> 13189.73s]  But like
[13189.73s -> 13191.73s]  give me a fun toy.
[13191.73s -> 13194.16s]  I'll take a second bathroom.
[13194.16s -> 13196.98s]  I don't think that's even possible.
[13196.98s -> 13210.66s]  Thank God.
[13210.66s -> 13214.69s]  This bed smells like Cheez-Its.
[13214.69s -> 13272.22s]  I didn't eat Cheez-Its in here.
[13272.22s -> 13274.22s]  Okay, alright.
[13274.22s -> 13276.22s]  Alright, I need two shadows in here.
[13276.22s -> 13278.22s]  Oh yeah, that's a bad dream for Joyma.
[13278.22s -> 13281.17s]  Hey boys, yeah
[13281.17s -> 13283.17s]  get him up, get him up.
[13283.17s -> 13285.17s]  He's having a bad dream, ain't that right
[13285.17s -> 13287.17s]  big boy?
[13287.17s -> 13289.98s]  You're all alone.
[13289.98s -> 13291.98s]  All alone in your house.
[13291.98s -> 13293.98s]  What, you miss that maid? You miss that cute maid
[13293.98s -> 13295.98s]  from the other day?
[13295.98s -> 13297.98s]  Yeah, get him up.
[13297.98s -> 13300.16s]  Get him up.
[13300.16s -> 13302.16s]  When's the last time you showered
[13302.16s -> 13305.17s]  big boy?
[13305.17s -> 13308.69s]  Okay, come on.
[13308.69s -> 13310.69s]  Yeah, that's it. Get him up.
[13310.69s -> 13312.69s]  Get him in the bathroom.
[13312.69s -> 13314.69s]  Oh, I can smell him from here.
[13314.69s -> 13317.06s]  Come on, both of you.
[13317.06s -> 13319.06s]  I'm not going to get my hands dirty.
[13319.06s -> 13321.06s]  Come on.
[13321.06s -> 13323.06s]  Yeah.
[13323.06s -> 13325.62s]  Big boy Joyma.
[13325.62s -> 13327.62s]  What's this, your game station?
[13327.62s -> 13329.62s]  Oh, take a look at that.
[13331.62s -> 13333.62s]  I can smell it from here.
[13333.62s -> 13335.62s]  What's that, dude?
[13335.62s -> 13337.62s]  You gotta go to the bathroom, big guy.
[13337.62s -> 13339.62s]  Looks to me like you gotta go
[13339.62s -> 13341.62s]  to the bathroom. Someone's not been
[13341.62s -> 13343.62s]  taking care of their needs, boss.
[13343.62s -> 13345.62s]  Get him on the toilet.
[13345.62s -> 13348.05s]  Yeah, that's it.
[13348.05s -> 13350.05s]  Yeah.
[13350.05s -> 13352.05s]  Then Jerma poops himself.
[13352.05s -> 13354.05s]  This is Kensington's class.
[13354.05s -> 13356.05s]  He poops himself in front of everybody.
[13356.05s -> 13358.05s]  No, no, I didn't poop my pants.
[13358.05s -> 13360.05s]  And then a cowboy comes out of the shower.
[13360.05s -> 13362.05s]  You can poop yourself in the shower.
[13362.05s -> 13364.05s]  That'd be embarrassing to poop yourself
[13364.05s -> 13366.05s]  in front of so many people.
[13366.05s -> 13368.05s]  This is Kensington's class.
[13368.05s -> 13370.05s]  And the cowboy's got a sword.
[13370.05s -> 13372.05s]  Yeah, you just pooped yourself.
[13372.05s -> 13374.05s]  You better keep pooping yourself there, boy.
[13374.05s -> 13376.05s]  And then he starts screaming.
[13376.05s -> 13378.05s]  You're pooping.
[13378.05s -> 13380.05s]  Hey, everybody, it's me, Jerma 95.
[13380.05s -> 13382.05s]  You live pooping yourself?
[13382.05s -> 13384.05s]  No. Yeah, you are.
[13384.05s -> 13386.05s]  Yeah, you are.
[13386.05s -> 13388.05s]  You're pooping yourself
[13388.05s -> 13390.05s]  on television. Oh, yeah.
[13390.05s -> 13392.05s]  I bet you like that, big boy.
[13394.05s -> 13396.05s]  I'm about to go live.
[13396.05s -> 13398.05s]  That's a TOS violation.
[13398.05s -> 13400.05s]  That's a TOS violation. What can go live?
[13400.05s -> 13402.05s]  And he gets up again.
[13402.05s -> 13404.05s]  I hear your stomach growling. Get up.
[13404.05s -> 13406.05s]  Kensington before 3 o'clock.
[13406.05s -> 13408.05s]  They get him up and then they go to the kitchen.
[13408.05s -> 13410.05s]  And he doesn't wash his hands, either.
[13410.05s -> 13412.05s]  Oh, disgusting. I wash my hands
[13412.05s -> 13414.05s]  every time. Yeah, sure you do, pal.
[13414.05s -> 13416.05s]  Oh.
[13420.05s -> 13422.05s]  No.
[13422.05s -> 13424.05s]  No, I didn't shit myself.
[13426.05s -> 13428.05s]  I'm a good boy.
[13434.05s -> 13436.05s]  Make the sandwich with you.
[13436.05s -> 13438.05s]  It's your dream, big guy.
[13438.05s -> 13440.05s]  Go make the sandwich.
[13440.05s -> 13442.05s]  Oh, no.
[13442.05s -> 13444.05s]  Make the sandwich with your fucking friend.
[13444.05s -> 13446.05s]  You don't have way back where I'm from.
[13446.05s -> 13448.05s]  And then Jerma woke up.
[13448.05s -> 13450.05s]  Oh, man.
[13479.33s -> 13520.67s]  What the fuck?
[13520.67s -> 13532.11s]  Huh? What am I doing in here?
[13532.11s -> 13536.27s]  Oh, my God.
[13536.27s -> 13538.27s]  You know, when you ever have a dream,
[13538.27s -> 13540.27s]  you ever have a dream where you,
[13540.27s -> 13542.27s]  and you have it, you have it, you have it,
[13542.27s -> 13544.27s]  you ever have it when you have it, you ever have it
[13544.27s -> 13546.27s]  when you have a dream, you have it when you have it and you had it?
[13546.27s -> 13555.17s]  I feel awful.
[13555.17s -> 13560.66s]  Why is this stuff all over here?
[13560.66s -> 13562.66s]  I had this dream, I like,
[13562.66s -> 13565.66s]  I had this fourth grade teacher
[13565.66s -> 13567.66s]  and I like pooped my pants
[13567.66s -> 13569.66s]  in the class, but whatever. You guys don't know that.
[13569.66s -> 13571.66s]  You don't need to know that. Nobody needs to know that here.
[13571.66s -> 13574.54s]  But pretty much the end of the story
[13574.54s -> 13576.54s]  is I had a bad dream about like how people like laughed
[13576.54s -> 13578.54s]  at me, thought I was stupid and like, you know, whatever.
[13578.54s -> 13585.44s]  Ugh.
[13585.44s -> 13587.44s]  What a fucking joke.
[13587.44s -> 13589.87s]  Why is all my stuff everywhere?
[13589.87s -> 13591.87s]  Why is my stuff everywhere?
[13591.87s -> 13596.10s]  And why am I holding two pieces of bread?
[13596.10s -> 13601.15s]  Ay, yi, yi.
[13601.15s -> 13607.22s]  Ugh. That was
[13607.22s -> 13609.22s]  very weird.
[13609.22s -> 13611.22s]  That was very
[13611.22s -> 13613.22s]  weird. That was,
[13613.22s -> 13622.37s]  that was...
[13622.37s -> 13626.78s]  I want to go play the organ.
[13626.78s -> 13628.78s]  At least I'll have some fun.
[13628.78s -> 13637.41s]  Ugh. Do I have any mail?
[13637.41s -> 13639.41s]  I mean, I gotta get rid of this.
[13639.41s -> 13642.14s]  I mean,
[13642.14s -> 13645.02s]  I didn't see that on camera.
[13645.02s -> 13648.54s]  What's in the mail?
[13648.54s -> 13651.49s]  It got
[13651.49s -> 13657.44s]  rain.
[13657.44s -> 13665.50s]  What's in the mail? There's nothing in the mailbox.
[13665.50s -> 13670.05s]  I don't see
[13670.05s -> 13672.05s]  anything in this mailbox. There's nothing
[13672.05s -> 13677.17s]  in the mailbox. There was no mail.
[13677.17s -> 13684.85s]  I'm doing this.
[13684.85s -> 13694.05s]  ...
[13694.05s -> 13696.05s]  ...
[13696.05s -> 13698.99s]  ...
[13698.99s -> 13701.17s]  Public domain music?
[13701.17s -> 13704.11s]  Is that what they said?
[13704.11s -> 13706.11s]  Um, okay.

[13727.04s -> 13738.93s]  ...
[13738.93s -> 13743.98s]  Maybe take a shower now.
[13743.98s -> 13762.67s]  That's fucking water.
[13767.14s -> 13772.00s]  Real shower.
[13772.00s -> 13774.00s]  Good thing I have my tennis shot.
[13774.00s -> 13794.72s]  Hey. There we go.
[13794.72s -> 13797.41s]  Nice and clean.
[13797.41s -> 13800.42s]  Ready to take on the day.

[13981.95s -> 13983.95s]  ...
[13983.95s -> 13995.34s]  Um, you dropped this.
[13995.34s -> 13997.34s]  Oh, thank you so much.
[13997.34s -> 13999.34s]  Yes. You looking for an outlet?
[13999.34s -> 14001.34s]  Oh, yeah. I think there's...
[14001.34s -> 14003.34s]  I have no idea where one is.
[14003.34s -> 14005.34s]  I think there's one outlet in the whole house.
[14005.34s -> 14007.34s]  There's one right here, sir. Thank you.
[14007.34s -> 14009.34s]  You got it? Yeah, I got it.
[14009.34s -> 14018.82s]  That's a beautiful vacuum cleaner.
[14018.82s -> 14020.82s]  A lot of bathroom usage for you today, sir.
[14020.82s -> 14022.82s]  Almost as beautiful as you.
[14022.82s -> 14024.82s]  What?
[14024.82s -> 14027.31s]  That vacuum is almost as beautiful as you are.
[14027.31s -> 14031.92s]  I mean it. What is it? What's that?
[14031.92s -> 14033.92s]  That's the sweetest thing I've heard all week.
[14033.92s -> 14035.92s]  Thank you. Yeah.
[14035.92s -> 14037.92s]  Can I get a hug? Yes, sure.
[14037.92s -> 14043.02s]  Absolutely. Come here.
[14043.02s -> 14045.58s]  Thank you.
[14045.58s -> 14047.89s]  You need to go to the bathroom. It's right here.
[14047.89s -> 14049.89s]  Thank you for telling me that.
[14049.89s -> 14051.89s]  Yes, of course. Absolutely.
[14051.89s -> 14059.31s]  And you know that I mean it.
[14059.31s -> 14061.31s]  I keep getting this fucking huge migraine.
[14061.31s -> 14064.06s]  And I feel like someone is telling me
[14064.06s -> 14066.06s]  I'm being controlled by something.
[14066.06s -> 14070.14s]  What the fuck?
[14070.14s -> 14073.09s]  I mean, they look good.
[14073.09s -> 14076.03s]  They do. They look good.
[14076.03s -> 14084.06s]  Everything okay in here?
[14084.06s -> 14086.06s]  Yeah, no. Everything's great in here.
[14088.06s -> 14090.30s]  Sorry.
[14090.30s -> 14092.30s]  You might know I'm not that used to cleaning
[14092.30s -> 14094.30s]  up stuff.
[14094.30s -> 14096.30s]  Okay.
[14096.30s -> 14098.30s]  What's the problem?
[14098.30s -> 14101.31s]  What's the problem? Yeah.
[14101.31s -> 14103.31s]  It's a computer. You can just move it out of the way.
[14103.31s -> 14105.31s]  I'm unsure how to clean it, sir.
[14105.31s -> 14107.31s]  Well, just push it out of the way and you can just dust it or something.
[14107.31s -> 14109.81s]  Yeah, I'll be in here. You got it.
[14109.81s -> 14112.30s]  You're fine. Great.
[14112.30s -> 14114.30s]  I'll just move it out of the way.
[14114.30s -> 14124.02s]  Oh, I like what they did with this.
[14124.02s -> 14132.59s]  I gotta go to work.
[14132.59s -> 14134.59s]  Oh, that's not too loud.
[14134.59s -> 14136.59s]  No, it's fine. I gotta go to work. I'll see you later.
[14136.59s -> 14138.59s]  Have a good time. Thank you.
[14138.59s -> 14140.59s]  Again, I want and this might be a little neurotic,
[14140.59s -> 14142.59s]  but I like vertical lines,
[14142.59s -> 14144.59s]  not horizontal. Okay.
[14144.59s -> 14146.59s]  You like vertical lines, not horizontal.
[14146.59s -> 14148.59s]  You get a couch in the middle of your living room.
[14148.59s -> 14150.59s]  You use the computer in your bathroom.
[14150.59s -> 14152.59s]  I woke up and came here and there was a piece of
[14152.59s -> 14154.59s]  toilet paper on the floor. We prefer vertical lines.
[14154.59s -> 14157.09s]  You can do horizontal if you want.
[14157.09s -> 14159.33s]  I would hope.
[14159.33s -> 14161.33s]  Yeah. You can do horizontal.
[14165.57s -> 14168.70s]  Vertical lines.
[14168.70s -> 14175.36s]  You guys are psycho.
[14175.36s -> 14177.36s]  Not very much slack left, by the way.
[14186.32s -> 14188.32s]  Thank God for Uncle Ted, because otherwise
[14188.32s -> 14190.32s]  I would have no fucking money.
[14190.32s -> 14619.86s]  See you later. Goodbye.
[14619.86s -> 14622.10s]  That was a good day. I feel pretty good about that day.
[14622.10s -> 14624.34s]  Hungry. Thirsty.
[14624.34s -> 14627.90s]  Ready. But I made some money.
[14627.90s -> 14630.66s]  That's good, right? Still kind of a mess out there.
[14630.66s -> 14633.34s]  I really wish the...
[14633.34s -> 14635.34s]  I really wish...
[14635.34s -> 14637.34s]  Goodbye. Yep. See you later.
[14637.34s -> 14639.34s]  I didn't press it.
[14639.34s -> 14641.58s]  I gotta get that doorbell
[14641.58s -> 14643.58s]  looked at. I need like an electrician.
[14643.58s -> 14650.10s]  Okay. Why is this
[14650.10s -> 14654.00s]  open? Why is this open?
[14654.00s -> 14663.84s]  Ugh. It looks pretty
[14663.84s -> 14666.53s]  clean in here. Not bad.
[14666.53s -> 14668.77s]  I mean, it could be a little better, but
[14668.77s -> 14683.86s]  whatever.
[14683.86s -> 14685.86s]  Hi.
[14685.86s -> 14688.46s]  Um. How dare you
[14688.46s -> 14690.46s]  just walk in when I'm cleaning?
[14690.46s -> 14692.46s]  The shoes are in the bed? What?
[14692.46s -> 14694.46s]  You had your shoes on. I took them off. I'm not a psycho.
[14694.46s -> 14696.46s]  I don't sleep with my shoes on. But you took your shoes off
[14696.46s -> 14698.46s]  and the shoes were in the bed with you. Why were they not
[14698.46s -> 14700.46s]  on the side of the bed? Because I was cleaning the bed and I put
[14700.46s -> 14702.46s]  them on the side of the bed. You weren't here for that.
[14702.46s -> 14704.46s]  Anyway, it took me a little bit longer today, so it's going to
[14704.46s -> 14707.09s]  be $300.
[14707.09s -> 14709.09s]  Okay. Um. Is that because you slept
[14709.09s -> 14711.09s]  in the room, or is that because you do... You don't
[14711.09s -> 14713.26s]  talk to me like that.
[14713.26s -> 14715.26s]  Um, no, I was...
[14715.26s -> 14717.26s]  Amelia, it was...
[14717.26s -> 14719.26s]  It's fine. I was just saying, like
[14719.26s -> 14721.26s]  I come from work and you're in bed. I picked up a piece of toilet paper
[14721.26s -> 14723.26s]  with poop on it, but I'm the one to blame.
[14723.26s -> 14726.08s]  There's been more than one person here.
[14726.08s -> 14728.08s]  There's been at least four people here. I found a pair of
[14728.08s -> 14730.38s]  pants with poop on it. Did you poop
[14730.38s -> 14732.88s]  yourself? I'm wearing the same
[14732.88s -> 14734.88s]  pants I was five days
[14734.88s -> 14736.88s]  ago. That's even more concerning.
[14736.88s -> 14738.88s]  And by the way, I
[14738.88s -> 14740.88s]  may have pooped my pants, but
[14740.88s -> 14742.88s]  goodness gracious, I mean,
[14742.88s -> 14744.88s]  you look great.
[14744.88s -> 14746.88s]  And I think that you and I could probably
[14746.88s -> 14748.88s]  maybe go out sometime.
[14748.88s -> 14750.88s]  Well, I don't know. I'll see what I'm doing
[14750.88s -> 14752.88s]  tomorrow. Let's call it $300
[14752.88s -> 14754.88s]  and I'll be on my way. Sure, $300.
[14754.88s -> 14756.88s]  Great. Hey.
[14756.88s -> 14758.88s]  It's been great. It's been fantastic.
[14758.88s -> 14760.88s]  We should go out sometime.
[14760.88s -> 14762.88s]  You want to go out sometime?
[14762.88s -> 14764.88s]  Well, I just said I might be free tomorrow.
[14764.88s -> 14766.88s]  Yeah, but like, I got
[14766.88s -> 14768.88s]  a wild schedule. Can I confirm
[14768.88s -> 14771.25s]  it? Sure. Okay.
[14771.25s -> 14773.25s]  I don't think I want to shake
[14773.25s -> 14775.25s]  your hand after you said you pooped yourself.
[14775.25s -> 14777.25s]  How about this one? Great.
[14777.25s -> 14787.41s]  Yeah! Woohoo!
[14787.41s -> 14800.77s]  Got a date!
[14800.77s -> 14802.77s]  You know, there are, there are,
[14802.77s -> 14804.77s]  um, there are
[14804.77s -> 14807.14s]  three to four options
[14807.14s -> 14809.14s]  when you get a choice.
[14809.14s -> 14811.14s]  You know, there's a few
[14811.14s -> 14813.14s]  different things you can choose from each time.
[14813.14s -> 14815.50s]  Not sure you're aware of
[14815.50s -> 14819.98s]  that at this point. I feel pretty good.
[14819.98s -> 14821.98s]  I feel pretty good. I feel pretty good.
[14821.98s -> 14824.16s]  Although I'm very hungry.
[14824.16s -> 14827.10s]  Oh!
[14827.10s -> 14838.88s]  Can I eat something?
[14838.88s -> 14844.94s]  What are you going to do? I saw
[14844.94s -> 14846.94s]  mine, that's the first time I've looked at chat in like
[14846.94s -> 14848.94s]  four plus hours or so. I saw
[14848.94s -> 14851.44s]  minus twos. Thank you.
[14851.44s -> 14866.67s]  It looks the same
[14866.67s -> 14868.67s]  loaf of bread every time.
[14868.67s -> 14877.12s]  This bread has lasted a long
[14877.12s -> 14885.18s]  time. I hope
[14885.18s -> 14887.18s]  my hands are really clean. I've been cleaning them.
[14887.18s -> 14891.86s]  I'm actually glad I'm wearing these gloves
[14891.86s -> 14894.54s]  because, I mean,
[14894.54s -> 14896.54s]  they're just, they're absolutely gross, but I really
[14896.54s -> 14901.60s]  am happy I have them on.
[14901.60s -> 14903.60s]  I have an apple too. Why would I not eat the apple?
[14903.60s -> 14923.68s]  I want to hang out in here.
[14923.68s -> 14930.40s]  Ah! Ah! I'm going to sit down.
[14930.40s -> 14933.41s]  God! You work all
[14933.41s -> 14935.41s]  day. You come back.
[14935.41s -> 14939.31s]  You just want to sit on your bed.
[14939.31s -> 14941.31s]  Why were they sleeping in here?
[14941.31s -> 14947.78s]  I could have paid you hundreds of dollars
[14947.78s -> 14950.02s]  to sleep in the bed.
[14950.02s -> 14953.02s]  Like, I wonder how, I was gone
[14953.02s -> 14955.02s]  for six and a half hours.
[14955.02s -> 14957.02s]  I bet you they were sleeping in this bed before.
[14957.02s -> 14968.46s]  What?
[14968.46s -> 14971.54s]  I'm not going to, I'm not
[14971.54s -> 14976.08s]  smelling anything.
[14976.08s -> 14978.08s]  In fact, I want this bed
[14978.08s -> 14980.08s]  fucking removed from the house.
[14980.08s -> 14989.87s]  All right, let's do some Twitch TV
[14989.87s -> 14995.87s]  streaming.
[14995.87s -> 15008.85s]  Every time. Okay.
[15008.85s -> 15010.85s]  Let's go. Get these,
[15010.85s -> 15012.85s]  I got to get at least one off, right?
[15012.85s -> 15018.42s]  Okay, let's go live.
[15018.42s -> 15022.90s]  So, we're going to do some
[15022.90s -> 15025.39s]  Germacraft, some Minecraft.
[15025.39s -> 15027.39s]  I'm going to call this episode one.
[15027.39s -> 15029.39s]  Live Germacraft.
[15029.39s -> 15036.10s]  And let's go live.
[15036.10s -> 15038.72s]  Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[15038.72s -> 15040.72s]  Germa here with episode one
[15040.72s -> 15042.72s]  of Germacraft.
[15042.72s -> 15044.72s]  You know, of course, the series where I play Minecraft.
[15044.72s -> 15046.72s]  And it's going to be really fun.
[15046.72s -> 15048.72s]  It's going to be a lot of trials, a lot of triumphs,
[15048.72s -> 15050.72s]  a lot of fails. And
[15050.72s -> 15054.74s]  uh,
[15054.74s -> 15509.20s]  that was a funny
[15509.20s -> 15511.95s]  dream.
[15511.95s -> 15513.95s]  So, by the
[15513.95s -> 15515.95s]  way, before I turn the stream off, everybody, I just want to say,
[15515.95s -> 15517.95s]  um, if you
[15517.95s -> 15520.38s]  go to Germa985.com,
[15520.38s -> 15522.38s]  we've got
[15522.38s -> 15524.38s]  merchandise for you, we've got posters
[15524.38s -> 15526.38s]  for you, we've got all kinds of things you can get, and
[15526.38s -> 15528.38s]  some of them might even be signed, too.
[15528.38s -> 15531.07s]  Oh, sorry, I'm talking to you guys, too.
[15531.07s -> 15533.07s]  Have a good day.
[15533.07s -> 15535.07s]  I'm not even online. The stream's been off for like the last
[15535.07s -> 15540.51s]  three hours. I'm going to be banned for two days.
[15540.51s -> 15544.10s]  Am I going to get permanently banned
[15544.10s -> 15546.10s]  from Twitch if I do that again?
[15546.10s -> 15548.10s]  Just don't do that again. I actually might not be able
[15548.10s -> 15550.10s]  to stream again. If you want, like, income,
[15550.10s -> 15558.67s]  don't do that.
[15558.67s -> 15563.66s]  So that's what I heard. Ah, cool!
[15563.66s -> 15565.66s]  A bunk bed!
[15565.66s -> 15577.10s]  Oh! It's another
[15577.10s -> 15579.10s]  mystery box! Oh my
[15579.10s -> 15581.10s]  goodness, I wonder what's in this one!
[15581.10s -> 15583.66s]  God, you give people
[15583.66s -> 15585.66s]  a loot box option, and that's what they're going to pick
[15585.66s -> 15587.66s]  like three out of ten times, which would be 30%,
[15587.66s -> 15589.66s]  which is not that much. I mean like five out of ten,
[15589.66s -> 15591.66s]  which would be fifty. How about let's go eight out of ten?
[15591.66s -> 15600.62s]  You couldn't have put
[15600.62s -> 15602.93s]  anything else in there, in here.
[15602.93s -> 15604.93s]  You couldn't have put like rubber duckies or something.
[15604.93s -> 15606.93s]  It's three more stools?
[15606.93s -> 15608.93s]  This is the biggest bait ever.
[15608.93s -> 15610.93s]  People would probably be pissed.
[15610.93s -> 15616.48s]  Okay, I'm...
[15616.48s -> 15618.48s]  Alright, well...
[15618.48s -> 15621.49s]  Let's get this out of the way.
[15621.49s -> 15623.49s]  I heard an explosion in
[15623.49s -> 15628.48s]  this room. This bed is...
[15628.48s -> 15631.10s]  I'm moving this.
[15631.10s -> 15633.10s]  Get this out of the way. I'm putting
[15633.10s -> 15637.39s]  this over here.
[15637.39s -> 15639.39s]  Let me at least get this correct here.
[15639.39s -> 15645.34s]  Decorate? Yeah, I can do that.
[15645.34s -> 15648.80s]  Although I do have to pee, so
[15648.80s -> 15650.80s]  I would do that soon.
[15650.80s -> 15653.86s]  Um...
[15653.86s -> 15655.86s]  Can I get rid of the box part of the decoration?
[15655.86s -> 15661.23s]  Where would I want the bed?
[15661.23s -> 15664.43s]  I definitely don't want
[15664.43s -> 15666.43s]  the bed in front of the door. That would be a pain in the ass.
[15666.43s -> 15670.14s]  Let's go with over here.
[15670.14s -> 15673.34s]  Probably against the wall. I want it against the wall.
[15673.34s -> 15676.67s]  That makes more sense to me.
[15676.67s -> 15685.89s]  That looks good. Why would you have a bed
[15685.89s -> 15689.73s]  like over here?
[15689.73s -> 15692.80s]  I like that. It's a twin bed.
[15692.80s -> 15694.80s]  I don't have to worry about the other side. Who cares?
[15694.80s -> 15699.09s]  Alright, then what about the mystery box?
[15699.09s -> 15704.59s]  We can put that in the corner.
[15704.59s -> 15707.28s]  And then I'll put the...
[15707.28s -> 15710.03s]  I'll put these in the...
[15710.03s -> 15713.10s]  I don't know. What am I supposed to do with these?
[15713.10s -> 15718.74s]  What a shitty bedroom.
[15718.74s -> 15721.17s]  This looks like I'm still moving
[15721.17s -> 15723.34s]  into this house.
[15723.34s -> 15730.94s]  How about two over there,
[15730.94s -> 15733.89s]  and two over here.
[15733.89s -> 15737.09s]  Good.
[15737.09s -> 15739.09s]  I have to pee real bad, like right now.
[15739.09s -> 15742.93s]  How about on top of the
[15742.93s -> 15746.51s]  mystery box?
[15746.51s -> 15750.67s]  Beautiful day outside. Beautiful day.
[15750.67s -> 15753.36s]  I want one of these next to the
[15753.36s -> 15755.86s]  bed so I can put my legs over.
[15755.86s -> 15759.44s]  That makes sense to me.
[15759.44s -> 15761.44s]  There couldn't have been anything else in that box.
[15761.44s -> 15768.16s]  Anything else.
[15768.16s -> 15770.16s]  I don't know what to do with these.
[15770.16s -> 15772.16s]  I don't even have a shelf
[15772.16s -> 15774.59s]  to put anything on.
[15774.59s -> 15776.59s]  That's there. That can just stay there.
[15776.59s -> 15778.90s]  I don't care.
[15778.90s -> 15781.39s]  That's fine. That can stay.
[15781.39s -> 15783.95s]  How does it look? You like it?
[15783.95s -> 15786.64s]  What do you think?
[15786.64s -> 15796.94s]  Thank you.
[15796.94s -> 15798.94s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[15798.94s -> 15800.94s]  This is nice, 985. This is a wonderful,
[15800.94s -> 15802.94s]  wonderful place. Thank you for letting me be.
[15802.94s -> 15804.94s]  I appreciate it. Do you think we should try?
[15804.94s -> 15806.94s]  I don't see why we shouldn't.
[15806.94s -> 15808.94s]  I think it'll make sense.
[15808.94s -> 15810.94s]  It's even in tune.
[15810.94s -> 15812.94s]  This is perfect. Wonderful.
[15812.94s -> 15814.94s]  Why don't we start off with some 985?
[15814.94s -> 15816.94s]  We'll practice 985?
[15816.94s -> 15818.94s]  985. That sounds good.
[15818.94s -> 15820.94s]  Let's do that. 985.
[15820.94s -> 15824.78s]  I'm trying something new.
[15824.78s -> 15826.78s]  Alright.
[15826.78s -> 15830.11s]  Go ahead.
[15830.11s -> 15834.46s]  Or get outside.
[15834.46s -> 15836.46s]  God our
[15836.46s -> 15838.46s]  father.
[15838.46s -> 15840.70s]  He's our daddy.
[15842.70s -> 15845.20s]  He's our
[15845.20s -> 15847.20s]  friend.
[15847.20s -> 15849.20s]  He's our friend.
[15849.20s -> 15852.46s]  He's our hand.
[15852.46s -> 15858.67s]  Father, not daddy.
[15858.67s -> 15860.67s]  Sorry about that.
[15860.67s -> 15862.67s]  Sorry about that.
[15862.67s -> 15864.67s]  Hello.
[15864.67s -> 15866.67s]  Excuse me.
[15866.67s -> 15868.67s]  Edna, how are you?
[15868.67s -> 15870.67s]  I'm doing great. Who are you?
[15870.67s -> 15872.67s]  Jerma,
[15872.67s -> 15874.67s]  you were here a few days ago?
[15874.67s -> 15876.67s]  You came here last week?
[15876.67s -> 15878.67s]  Jerma, we heard you had this wonderful
[15878.67s -> 15880.67s]  organ.
[15880.67s -> 15882.67s]  I heard how impressive your organ was.
[15882.67s -> 15884.67s]  And I just wanted to come over and play
[15884.67s -> 15886.67s]  with your organ. With my
[15886.67s -> 15888.67s]  choir, of course, from church.
[15888.67s -> 15890.67s]  Bless you.
[15890.67s -> 15892.67s]  Bless you too.
[15892.67s -> 15894.67s]  If you want to join in.
[15894.67s -> 15896.67s]  Would you like to join in?
[15896.67s -> 15898.67s]  Why don't you just stick around
[15898.67s -> 15900.67s]  and see what happens.
[15900.67s -> 15902.67s]  Step on over with them. That'll be great.
[15902.67s -> 15904.67s]  Your organ is so big I'll have to use two
[15904.67s -> 15906.67s]  hands. Here we go.
[15906.67s -> 15908.67s]  I think you use two hands to play an organ.
[15908.67s -> 15910.67s]  I don't think you play an organ with one
[15910.67s -> 15912.67s]  hand. It's not like a flute.
[15912.67s -> 15914.67s]  Over here?
[15914.67s -> 15916.67s]  Let's take it from the top.
[15916.67s -> 15918.67s]  From the top of where?
[15918.67s -> 15920.67s]  You'll figure it out.
[15920.67s -> 15922.67s]  What page are we on?
[15922.67s -> 15925.36s]  God came
[15925.36s -> 15927.36s]  down from the land.
[15927.36s -> 15929.36s]  God came
[15929.36s -> 15931.36s]  down from the land.
[15931.36s -> 15933.36s]  And he took
[15933.36s -> 15935.36s]  us all by the hand.
[15935.36s -> 15937.36s]  And he took
[15937.36s -> 15939.36s]  us all by the hand.
[15939.36s -> 15941.36s]  And then
[15941.36s -> 15943.36s]  we started
[15943.36s -> 15945.36s]  dancing.
[15945.36s -> 15948.18s]  And then we started
[15948.18s -> 15950.18s]  dancing.
[15950.18s -> 15952.42s]  He's got the spirit.
[15952.42s -> 15954.42s]  Remix.
[15954.42s -> 15956.42s]  Remix.
[15956.42s -> 15958.42s]  God came down to the land
[15958.42s -> 15960.42s]  in the land. God came down
[15960.42s -> 15962.42s]  to the land in the land.
[15962.42s -> 15964.42s]  I can't believe what's happening right now.
[15964.42s -> 15966.42s]  I can't believe what's
[15966.42s -> 15968.42s]  happening right now.
[15968.42s -> 15970.42s]  Oh, okay.
[15970.42s -> 15972.42s]  And he came down to the...
[15972.42s -> 15974.42s]  Why don't you lead us in it?
[15974.42s -> 15976.42s]  And he came down to the
[15976.42s -> 15978.42s]  land. And he came
[15978.42s -> 15980.42s]  down to the land.
[15980.42s -> 15982.42s]  And he...
[15982.42s -> 15984.42s]  He ate...
[15984.42s -> 15986.42s]  He brought wine
[15986.42s -> 15988.42s]  and sand. And he
[15988.42s -> 15990.42s]  brought wine and sand.
[15990.42s -> 15992.42s]  And then he
[15992.42s -> 15994.42s]  left my
[15994.42s -> 15996.42s]  front yard. And then he
[15996.42s -> 15998.42s]  left my front yard.
[15998.42s -> 16000.42s]  They went in the fridge
[16000.42s -> 16002.42s]  and he got himself a nice big tub of lard.
[16002.42s -> 16004.42s]  And went to the fridge
[16004.42s -> 16006.42s]  and got a big tub of lard.
[16006.42s -> 16008.42s]  And the...
[16008.42s -> 16010.42s]  Get you drunk.
[16010.42s -> 16012.42s]  On God's love.
[16012.42s -> 16014.42s]  What the fuck is happening?
[16014.42s -> 16016.42s]  On God's love.
[16016.42s -> 16018.42s]  On God's love.
[16018.42s -> 16020.42s]  On God's...
[16020.42s -> 16022.42s]  God bless you all.
[16022.42s -> 16024.42s]  Is he done?
[16024.42s -> 16026.42s]  Get you drunk?
[16026.42s -> 16030.90s]  That was beautiful.
[16030.90s -> 16032.90s]  But that's my organ and I'd like for you all to leave.
[16032.90s -> 16034.90s]  Well, we would like our book back.
[16034.90s -> 16037.71s]  Unless you, of course, would like to study on your own.
[16037.71s -> 16039.71s]  We'll save it for you at the church and you can come
[16039.71s -> 16041.71s]  sing with us any time.
[16041.71s -> 16043.71s]  Alright. Wonderful.
[16043.71s -> 16045.71s]  Bless you. And bless this house.
[16045.71s -> 16047.71s]  Thank you. Please actually do that a few times.
[16047.71s -> 16049.71s]  Because there's been a lot of fucking weirdos here.
[16049.71s -> 16052.40s]  Bye now. Bye now.
[16052.40s -> 16056.30s]  Have a great day!
[16056.30s -> 16058.30s]  Alright.
[16058.30s -> 16060.30s]  I hope one day they're ready.
[16068.62s -> 16070.62s]  But wait, wait a minute. Wait a second.
[16070.62s -> 16073.18s]  Hey, wait, wait a minute!
[16073.18s -> 16075.55s]  Wait, I really want that book.
[16075.55s -> 16077.55s]  I want that book.
[16077.55s -> 16079.55s]  I think the book... Can I have one of those books?
[16079.55s -> 16081.55s]  Yes, sir. Thank you so much.
[16081.55s -> 16083.55s]  I'd love one of these books. Can I keep it?
[16083.55s -> 16085.55s]  Yes, you may. You probably should.
[16085.55s -> 16087.55s]  What passage should I
[16087.55s -> 16089.55s]  read from to get rid of bears
[16089.55s -> 16091.55s]  and people that I don't want in the house?
[16091.55s -> 16093.55s]  Jeremiah 9
[16093.55s -> 16095.55s]  8 5 is actually my favorite chapter.
[16095.55s -> 16097.55s]  Okay.
[16097.55s -> 16099.55s]  Here.
[16099.55s -> 16101.55s]  I'll put it in the mailbox.
[16101.55s -> 16103.55s]  Yes, probably good.
[16103.55s -> 16105.73s]  He'll find it.
[16105.73s -> 16107.73s]  And he'll find his way home.
[16107.73s -> 16109.73s]  Yes, we have.
[16109.73s -> 16111.73s]  Good job, sister. Very good.
[16111.73s -> 16115.70s]  I hope they're still there.
[16115.70s -> 16128.82s]  I really hope they're still here.
[16128.82s -> 16139.49s]  What an embarrassment.
[16139.49s -> 16147.74s]  I don't want to play this too loud because they'll come back.
[16147.74s -> 16149.74s]  I'm fucking hungry. I'm tired.
[16149.74s -> 16151.74s]  And I have not showered.
[16151.74s -> 16164.66s]  You hear that? Thank you.
[16164.66s -> 16180.91s]  How does she not know who I am?
[16180.91s -> 16182.91s]  She was here like fucking a week ago.
[16182.91s -> 16187.26s]  That's over budget of farting.
[16187.26s -> 16192.38s]  That's definitely over fart budget.
[16192.38s -> 16199.55s]  Better.
[16199.55s -> 16203.65s]  Thank goodness.
[16203.65s -> 16210.11s]  Oh yeah.
[16210.11s -> 16219.70s]  I brush my teeth every time I get in the shower.
[16219.70s -> 16221.70s]  Every time.
[16221.70s -> 16224.00s]  It saves like two minutes each day.
[16224.00s -> 16226.75s]  That's too over budget.
[16226.75s -> 16229.50s]  That's too many.
[16229.50s -> 16234.11s]  I know it's fun to do that.
[16234.11s -> 16236.11s]  But
[16236.11s -> 16238.93s]  no, I know it's really,
[16238.93s -> 16240.93s]  don't just get them all out of your system right now.
[16240.93s -> 16242.93s]  I'll shit in the shower.
[16242.93s -> 16247.86s]  Get them out of your system.
[16247.86s -> 16268.53s]  You need a lot of characters in your time.
[16268.53s -> 16271.47s]  But character development
[16271.47s -> 16273.47s]  and internal characterization of yourself
[16273.47s -> 16275.47s]  is very important.
[16275.47s -> 16277.78s]  The more you think about who you are as a person
[16277.78s -> 16279.78s]  and what you do, the deeds you do,
[16279.78s -> 16281.78s]  that's how you can shape
[16281.78s -> 16284.40s]  yourself as a person.
[16284.40s -> 16286.40s]  Or if you want to know,
[16286.40s -> 16288.40s]  fill words to make yourself sound intelligent.
[16288.40s -> 16294.74s]  Oh, should I have a date?
[16294.74s -> 16298.51s]  I have a date with a maid.
[16298.51s -> 16301.46s]  Fuck.
[16301.46s -> 16304.46s]  Right now?
[16304.46s -> 16306.46s]  I don't want to bail on Amelia.
[16306.46s -> 16317.79s]  That would be a mistake.
[16317.79s -> 16320.99s]  I'm just so tired.
[16320.99s -> 16322.99s]  They'll understand.
[16322.99s -> 16324.99s]  It's fine.
[16324.99s -> 16327.68s]  This is too comfy.
[16327.68s -> 16331.01s]  Another time.
[16331.01s -> 16804.72s]  I'll text them.
[16804.72s -> 16808.35s]  Kind of comfy, but what did I miss?
[16808.35s -> 16813.97s]  Oh, I had a date.
[16813.97s -> 16824.66s]  It's okay.
[16824.66s -> 16827.02s]  Oh, my back hurts.
[16827.02s -> 16830.16s]  You can't sleep sitting down.
[16830.16s -> 16840.77s]  Not bad. I felt worse.
[16840.77s -> 16853.86s]  Okay.
[16853.86s -> 16858.34s]  Uh, had a bed
[16858.34s -> 16861.66s]  already. Hungry.
[16861.66s -> 16863.66s]  This is not very stable, by the way.
[16863.66s -> 16866.86s]  I'm not sure I can sleep on this.
[16866.86s -> 16869.23s]  I already had a bed.
[16869.23s -> 16871.23s]  Is that a bed sandwich?
[16871.23s -> 16876.03s]  That's alright.
[16876.03s -> 16882.94s]  I had a better bed
[16882.94s -> 16884.94s]  in my dorm room in college than this.
[16884.94s -> 16891.78s]  Ugh. I'm hungry.
[16891.78s -> 16903.15s]  Ugh. Can I make
[16903.15s -> 16906.42s]  some food, please?
[16906.42s -> 16917.47s]  Am I making something to eat?
[16917.47s -> 16920.54s]  I'm so hungry.
[16920.54s -> 16925.15s]  I am starving.
[16925.15s -> 16927.15s]  Does it matter? Can I eat? I don't want to eat bread
[16927.15s -> 16929.39s]  for a seventh time.
[16929.39s -> 16936.43s]  I really don't. Here.
[16936.43s -> 16940.02s]  You know what? We're doing hot dogs.
[16940.02s -> 16942.64s]  What do I got? Do I have hot dogs?
[16942.64s -> 16944.64s]  No. We're doing butter and eggs.
[16944.64s -> 16960.51s]  My favorite. That was very loud.
[16960.51s -> 16963.71s]  There.
[16963.71s -> 16968.94s]  Ow. Not bad.
[16968.94s -> 16975.07s]  Not bad.
[16975.07s -> 16977.07s]  A few minutes. Another 30 seconds or so.
[16977.07s -> 16982.00s]  Should be ready to eat.
[16982.00s -> 16984.82s]  There we are. Need another cup.
[16984.82s -> 16986.82s]  Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops,
[16986.82s -> 16988.82s]  oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops,
