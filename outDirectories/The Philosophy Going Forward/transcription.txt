[0.63s -> 3.49s]  Hey, what's going on, everybody? How you guys doing?
[3.49s -> 6.23s]  Jerma here with a update little video.
[6.23s -> 10.33s]  I know this is like the second update video in the last three or four months.
[10.33s -> 14.53s]  And, you know, some things need to be said. There's a lot to talk about.
[14.53s -> 17.23s]  About the channel. About me.
[17.23s -> 20.93s]  And in the background of this video, it's not gonna be Spider-Man.
[20.93s -> 23.33s]  I promise, it's not gonna be Spider-Man 2 this time.
[23.33s -> 25.03s]  It's gonna be Spider-Man 3.
[25.03s -> 26.43s]  Shatter Dimensions.
[26.43s -> 29.53s]  Let's get started. These neighborhoods aren't gonna friendly themselves.
[29.63s -> 32.63s]  First of all, I want to say thank you to everybody for all the support,
[32.63s -> 37.00s]  all the kind words, and everybody that watched JermaRumble live action.
[37.00s -> 41.10s]  It's been live for a few weeks. It's had a chance to soak in and settle.
[41.10s -> 45.34s]  And I feel like now is a good enough time for me to, after that video being uploaded,
[45.34s -> 51.14s]  can talk about not just that video, but the direction of this channel
[51.14s -> 58.00s]  and the philosophy going forward that I want to use for the rest of the time I really use YouTube.
[58.00s -> 59.60s]  Because I've been doing this for a long time.
[59.70s -> 61.70s]  I've been doing YouTube for about five years now.
[61.70s -> 65.20s]  I think my fifth year anniversary, I believe, was in July.
[65.20s -> 67.60s]  I'm an old man. I've aged. I've gotten older.
[67.60s -> 71.40s]  I look like shit, by the way. I look like I'm gonna show you a pretty recent picture.
[71.40s -> 73.14s]  That's a picture of my face.
[73.14s -> 75.00s]  What the fuck happened?
[75.00s -> 77.20s]  But I've learned stuff. I've learned about myself.
[77.20s -> 80.08s]  I've learned about what I like to do, what I don't like to do.
[80.08s -> 84.12s]  I've gotten to a point where I think I've figured it all out, at least for myself, internally.
[84.12s -> 85.92s]  And it's as follows.
[85.92s -> 91.32s]  This channel from now on is gonna be videos that I really wanted to make,
[91.32s -> 95.36s]  that I wanted to spend time on, that I actually really wanted to care about.
[95.36s -> 98.76s]  And that might not be a video every couple days.
[98.76s -> 101.16s]  That might not be a video every couple weeks.
[101.16s -> 103.80s]  Whenever I get the urge to, you know what?
[103.80s -> 107.20s]  I want to make that, and I'm gonna make it, and I'm gonna put a bunch of time into it.
[107.20s -> 108.80s]  I'm gonna put a bunch of effort into it.
[108.80s -> 111.00s]  More than a couple weeks, more than a couple months.
[111.00s -> 115.87s]  Higher production value videos is what I want the main focus of this channel to be.
[115.87s -> 119.57s]  Now, that doesn't mean that every video from now on is gonna be a wrestling video.
[119.67s -> 125.57s]  Okay, he's gonna make like 40-minute live-action wrestling movies for the rest of the time he uses YouTube.
[125.57s -> 128.57s]  No, I mean, there will be more wrestling videos.
[128.57s -> 131.77s]  I guarantee you that, absolutely.
[131.77s -> 135.47s]  There's already ideas flying around of the next Jerma wrestling video.
[135.47s -> 137.57s]  But that's not gonna come out like next week.
[137.57s -> 139.67s]  That's not gonna be for a little while.
[139.67s -> 143.07s]  You're gonna have to give me a little while on that one, you know what I'm saying?
[143.07s -> 147.57s]  I don't want to throw any hopes up for people that it's gonna be coming out soon,
[147.57s -> 151.71s]  but we're working on it already, and other stuff already.
[151.71s -> 156.95s]  There's a lot of things that already are coming down the pipeline over the next couple months.
[156.95s -> 159.45s]  And some people might be saying to themselves right now and out loud,
[159.45s -> 162.87s]  maybe, maybe you're pointing at the monitor and talking at me.
[162.87s -> 164.87s]  Where, what about gaming? What about the gaming videos?
[164.87s -> 168.54s]  Are you just gonna be a live-action sketch comedy channel?
[168.54s -> 174.82s]  No, it doesn't, the subject matter doesn't matter anymore at this point for me.
[174.82s -> 177.62s]  Like, I think that's really the point I'm trying to get at with this whole,
[177.72s -> 183.48s]  with three minutes into this now, is I want to snip the line on the balloons that are tied to my wrist.
[183.48s -> 185.36s]  And just watch them fly.
[185.36s -> 188.36s]  You know, some balloons are gonna get stuck in a tree.
[188.36s -> 190.36s]  Some of those balloons are gonna keep flying.
[190.36s -> 194.96s]  Maybe some of those balloons are gonna reach outer space and get in contact with aliens.
[194.96s -> 197.36s]  Who knows? I just want to see the balloons fly.
[197.36s -> 200.46s]  I want to cover a lot of different bases. I want to do a lot of different stuff.
[200.46s -> 203.16s]  I already have a lot of things that I want to spend time on.
[203.16s -> 209.56s]  Like I said, it's one of those situations where game, non-game, it doesn't matter to me right now.
[209.56s -> 212.56s]  It completely is, that's out of the question for my brain.
[212.56s -> 216.84s]  It's what do I care about right now, and what do I want to spend time on.
[216.84s -> 219.74s]  But, here's the second part of this video.
[219.74s -> 226.63s]  And this is, you know, people that might be upset about the fact that I'm not making as many videos as I used to.
[226.63s -> 228.52s]  I have a second channel now.
[228.52s -> 232.92s]  And it's already up, it's already live, there's already like six videos on it.
[232.92s -> 236.42s]  You can go right now, the whole screen is a link.
[236.42s -> 240.12s]  This, right now, the annotation on the screen will take you to the channel.
[240.12s -> 241.62s]  There's a link in the description.
[241.62s -> 245.52s]  Go subscribe to that channel if you want to see a bunch of videos all the time.
[245.52s -> 251.13s]  Because what the second channel is going to be is a stream highlight channel from my Twitch stream.
[251.13s -> 253.53s]  And anything else that I want to put up there.
[253.53s -> 256.53s]  It could be random videos anytime I deem it necessary.
[256.53s -> 258.83s]  Just stuff that I don't want to put on this channel.
[258.83s -> 264.23s]  Because like I said, this channel I want to be reserved only for stuff like German Rumble live action.
[264.23s -> 268.60s]  And, you know, the high production, I just, we just talked about it for five minutes.
[268.60s -> 273.48s]  But second channel stream highlights, and we're going to have a schedule now.
[273.48s -> 276.45s]  We're going to have a schedule. Before I go into the second channel anymore,
[276.45s -> 281.68s]  my Twitch.tv stream is going to have a legit three day a week schedule.
[281.68s -> 286.98s]  Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, we're going to be live at seven o'clock Eastern time.
[286.98s -> 290.66s]  Seven p.m. Eastern time. That's my stream schedule.
[290.66s -> 291.86s]  I ain't doing this anymore.
[291.86s -> 296.06s]  I talked about this in the past how I don't like to have schedules because I never can adhere to them.
[296.06s -> 299.96s]  But sometimes it gets like to a point where it's like, what time is it?
[299.96s -> 303.36s]  Or it's like seven forty five. I wasn't like two in the morning.
[303.36s -> 305.96s]  Yeah, I'll stream for like six hours or whatever.
[305.96s -> 307.46s]  No, no, no. Two weeks go by.
[307.46s -> 309.76s]  What is this? A fucking thing of orange juice.
[309.76s -> 312.46s]  I'll chug that and then stream for like 20 minutes.
[312.46s -> 315.36s]  I got I got to have a schedule and that's what's going to happen.
[315.36s -> 319.56s]  Every Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, Twitch.tv slash German nine eight five.
[319.56s -> 321.66s]  I'll be live. I'll be playing anything.
[321.66s -> 324.66s]  It doesn't matter what it is. I'm going to just stream it and have fun.
[324.66s -> 331.18s]  Like I did like a month or two ago when I was streaming all the time and it's going to get edited.
[331.18s -> 335.38s]  The streams that I think are funny that I think are good are going to get put together
[335.38s -> 337.96s]  and get uploaded to that second channel.
[337.96s -> 340.76s]  They're going to be condensed. It's going to be high quality.
[340.76s -> 343.86s]  They're not going to be just thrown up for our live streams.
[343.86s -> 349.16s]  It's actually going to be videos like ones that you probably were used to seeing a couple of years ago
[349.16s -> 350.66s]  are going up on the channel.
[350.66s -> 355.96s]  I have a lot of them. I have a lot of videos to upload to that channel that is going to take me a while.
[355.96s -> 360.33s]  But you can expect at least a few videos a week uploaded to this channel.
[360.33s -> 363.83s]  Second channel links in the description in the screen.
[363.83s -> 367.93s]  Go there if you want to see a bunch of stream highlights and a bunch of other random videos
[367.93s -> 369.93s]  who knows what the hell I'm going to upload there.
[369.93s -> 372.93s]  I don't even know. You might see me eating breakfast.
[372.93s -> 374.93s]  It could happen. It could go up on that channel.
[374.93s -> 377.39s]  That's the second channel. You know what I'm saying?
[377.39s -> 379.29s]  That's pretty much it.
[379.29s -> 381.09s]  So let's go over it. Here we go again.
[381.09s -> 382.49s]  We're going to go over this one more time.
[382.49s -> 384.69s]  And I'm going to go over very A, B, C.
[384.69s -> 385.93s]  Okay. A.
[385.93s -> 387.03s]  Jerma985.
[387.03s -> 389.06s]  The channel you're on right now.
[389.06s -> 392.04s]  Infrequent, higher quality videos.
[392.04s -> 394.64s]  Videos that I cared about that I wanted to spend time on.
[394.64s -> 395.97s]  Infrequent.
[395.97s -> 397.37s]  Jerma.
[397.37s -> 398.47s]  I don't have a name for the channel yet.
[398.47s -> 401.04s]  It's just second Jerma channel.
[401.04s -> 402.62s]  Stream highlights.
[402.62s -> 403.62s]  Other videos.
[403.72s -> 405.82s]  Very frequent upload schedule.
[405.82s -> 406.62s]  All the time.
[406.62s -> 407.98s]  Content.
[407.98s -> 408.98s]  Twitch.tv.
[408.98s -> 410.08s]  C.
[410.08s -> 410.88s]  Tuesday.
[410.88s -> 412.08s]  Thursday and Friday.
[412.08s -> 413.96s]  7pm Eastern time.
[413.96s -> 415.60s]  Every single time.
[415.60s -> 416.80s]  No exceptions.
[416.80s -> 418.40s]  Unless I get like sick.
[418.40s -> 419.60s]  Then I won't stream.
[419.60s -> 421.57s]  But Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.
[421.57s -> 424.17s]  Twitch.tv slash Jerma985.
[424.17s -> 425.17s]  And that's all I got to say.
[425.17s -> 425.77s]  That's it.
[425.77s -> 429.97s]  I hope I could make it clear enough that these things are happening.
[429.97s -> 432.61s]  That this is kind of the direction the channel is taking now.
[432.61s -> 434.01s]  And yeah.
[434.01s -> 436.08s]  Go subscribe to Jerma2.
[436.08s -> 438.42s]  And I'll see you guys soon.
[438.42s -> 439.62s]  Have a good night guys.
[439.62s -> 440.72s]  See you later.
[440.72s -> 441.92s]  Have a good rest of your summer.
[441.92s -> 443.42s]  It's not even summer.
[443.42s -> 448.49s]  It's like, it's like September 26th.
[448.49s -> 450.03s]  Oh my god.
[450.03s -> 454.13s]  Yeah, the last time I made like a hey what's up guys video was in like fucking June.
[454.13s -> 455.70s]  Or like May.
[455.70s -> 458.90s]  It's been, have a good rest of your summer.
