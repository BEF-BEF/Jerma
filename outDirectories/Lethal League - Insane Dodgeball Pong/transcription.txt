[0.18s -> 9.82s]  I'm playing crocodile man. Alright, that's fine. You can be crocodile man.
[9.82s -> 15.62s]  Whoever has the biggest mouth for eating birds with. Alright, let's go, go, go, go, go.
[15.62s -> 19.66s]  Here we go. Alright, this is where we start. I'm not giving you any time. I don't know any
[19.66s -> 22.58s]  buttons, but I'm not giving you time. So am I like coming to punch you in the face?
[22.58s -> 27.78s]  Yeah, no, no, no, no. The ball. It's only the ball. Alright, oh, okay. So it's like
[27.78s -> 35.09s]  dodgeball. Is that how this works? Kind of, maybe. I don't know. This is like New Age
[35.09s -> 40.66s]  Pong. This seriously is New Pong. This is sick. I don't know. Wait, wait, wait. Okay,
[40.66s -> 45.54s]  I can do an eat move. I can do an eater. Yeah, you can like gently tap it and then
[45.54s -> 55.61s]  you launch it up. It's volleyball pong and it goes faster every time. Okay, I'm
[55.61s -> 62.82s]  going to beat you now. Yeah! Jesus! We just ponged the shit out of each other.
[62.86s -> 77.51s]  Alright, it's time for you to get PONGED by Mist. Oh, easy, easy. Okay, okay, this might be
[77.51s -> 87.06s]  too much for my brain. Oh, fucking come on. That was not fair. I was not, I wasn't, why
[87.06s -> 98.23s]  was it right? Oh, you're going to do the jump threat. I don't know what I'm doing. Alright,
[98.23s -> 103.47s]  it's X. Do you have an Xbox controller? I do. It's X. You can hold it to do like a
[103.47s -> 110.69s]  charge attack, I guess. I guess. Okay, I've got it. Do you understand? Yes. And there's also
[110.69s -> 119.23s]  special moves. Don't you know how to do special moves? I get it, I get it. The ball is your
[119.23s -> 136.98s]  color now, so if it hits me, then... At least we had a volley going. At least. It's your color,
[136.98s -> 142.90s]  so you can hit it. No, it was purple. Nobody's... No, it starts off as the losing persons. Oh,
[142.90s -> 151.29s]  it does? Easy. Yes, yes. Yeah, so you have three HP left. What are the special moves?
[151.29s -> 156.18s]  Oh, and I can break dance. I think you hold down the button, you press the button. Yeah,
[156.18s -> 160.82s]  I mean, but I think there's other special moves you can do too, maybe. Other? All I can do is
[160.82s -> 170.71s]  like do some like dances and stuff. Okay, well maybe we should have looked. Yes, that was not
[170.71s -> 179.31s]  my plan at all, but it worked. Oh, come on. Noob. I even said damn it. Oh, you want to see this
[179.31s -> 182.11s]  pretty... Oh, what's he going to do? What's he going to do? What's going to happen here? What's
[182.11s -> 187.99s]  going to happen? I didn't know who won that one. All right, it's two. It's two. We both have two HP.
[187.99s -> 196.79s]  Oh, you ducked. Excellent work. No, I want to go down. I want it to go like... How did we get it
[196.79s -> 203.15s]  to go nuts before? You have to jump and hit it. I'm going to win. No, you're not. Yes, I am. I
[203.15s -> 211.63s]  don't think you're already... This one! Okay, this is where we really need to step up the game here.
[212.35s -> 222.03s]  I'm pretty sure I can like charge it maybe after I hit it for like a... Come on. Yes! I did the...
[222.03s -> 228.74s]  I won. I won. I get 100 bucks. I won. I won. I get 100 bucks. I won. Wait, you get XP? You
[228.74s -> 236.93s]  level up in this game? Maybe you can like... Do you unlock abilities? Okay, okay. All right,
[236.93s -> 242.96s]  so no mercy. This is the no mercy round. I paused the game accidentally, but it actually helped me
[242.96s -> 250.64s]  out. No! It didn't help anyone out. That's one. That's one. You little frog piece of dookie.
[250.64s -> 259.58s]  Somebody's getting a little upset about this. Oh! Super! Super! Good luck. Good luck. Good luck.
[261.17s -> 268.37s]  Fuck you! How are you ever supposed to do that? Shit. Take that. That was a quick move. They call
[268.37s -> 272.53s]  it volleyball. They call that the quick move. Do they? Something tells me that's not what they
[272.53s -> 276.77s]  call that in volleyball, but it's okay. I'm not sure how much volleyball you know. Oh, what? Get
[276.77s -> 283.36s]  out of my... Get out of my house. Get out of my house. I almost forget my accident. Get out of my
[283.36s -> 295.23s]  house. Get out of my house. See you later. Man, it's so funny. It's getting destroyed. Hey,
[295.23s -> 300.59s]  you said no mercy. I did. How did you get up that high? I don't know. Maybe it's like a move my guy
[300.59s -> 312.93s]  has. Yeah, it's a move to die. Okay. All right. You thought you had it. You thought you had it.
[314.37s -> 322.90s]  Get out of my house. Hey, get ready. Oh, be careful with this. Be careful with this. No,
[322.90s -> 329.14s]  I was swinging at you. The ball went through me. It was very bizarre. It was bizarre, wasn't it?
[329.94s -> 333.78s]  Come on. I faked you out. You see, you thought I was going to hit it, but then I missed. I was
[333.78s -> 341.09s]  just going for the alley-oop. What is your special move? We saw mine. Mine's like insane.
[342.05s -> 349.78s]  Oh, God. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm trying to like hit it again. Oh, here you go.
[350.82s -> 355.94s]  I don't know how to get up that high to even get it. Can you... Oh, I jumped. Can you... Maybe my...
[355.94s -> 361.20s]  Oh, you can double jump. I can't double jump. Yeah, that's the thing your character can do,
[361.20s -> 366.96s]  not mine. I hit that. I hit that. No, I hit you and it canceled out your swing. Well, you know what?
[366.96s -> 377.98s]  I don't even care. I don't even care. I don't even care. Try to get it. How did you come back?
[377.98s -> 380.86s]  You're not coming back. You're not going to come back and win this. No, you're not going to use
[380.86s -> 387.42s]  your double jump and like double jump all over me. What? I thought I had way more time. It didn't go
[387.42s -> 395.57s]  all the way to the edge. Redo, rematch, triple match. Let's go. Let's go. This is like a dirty
[395.65s -> 400.05s]  pool. You don't like the dirty pool level? It's kind of cool, I guess.
[403.44s -> 409.68s]  You're really good with the alligator. I wasn't really... Hold on. I was just trying to figure out
[409.68s -> 423.33s]  one very... Come on. You read right through that. So is this the perfect that I'm going for?
[423.33s -> 428.66s]  You're not going to get a perfect. I can guarantee you that. See? Curl up in a ball. He can't see you.
[431.10s -> 435.44s]  All right. No. Get over here. You did that by accident. You didn't even know. No, I was trying
[435.44s -> 438.56s]  to hit you out. I knew you were going for a jump because you always do the jumps.
[439.28s -> 442.88s]  I always do do the jumps. You got to jump in. You don't have good anti-airs.
[444.94s -> 448.46s]  I thought you were going to hit it right back, but you didn't. Nope. No, I'm meta gaming.
[449.02s -> 454.94s]  All right. Fine. Get meta gamed. All right. I'm obviously not going to do that again.
[458.34s -> 464.27s]  He hit it underneath you this time. Whoa. You hit that from behind you because you have a tail.
[464.27s -> 471.86s]  I did a tail whip. Oh, doing the tail whip. Oh, you want to do a tail whip again?
[475.73s -> 479.17s]  You know what? Every time you jump into it and I keep thinking you're hitting it
[479.73s -> 488.46s]  like this. Yeah. Oh, like this. Oh, I did not think you were going to get that. I was putting
[488.46s -> 499.23s]  my controller down and about to start the ship talking. How do you get those every time?
[500.83s -> 506.10s]  I'm a sly alligator. I almost just lost right there.
[507.62s -> 515.39s]  Oh, now it is one and one. Who is going to end this epic battle of epic proportions?
[518.83s -> 531.55s]  What is happening? What just happened? That was the scariest thing I've ever done.
[531.55s -> 536.96s]  I didn't even think you hit it. Like this game's fun.
