[0.31s -> 12.31s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Scare Saturdays.
[12.31s -> 18.31s]  This time on Scare Saturday is going to be going through some of the co-op of Cry of Fear with Ster.
[18.31s -> 26.49s]  Now, before anybody asks any questions, this is not going to be a full let's play of Cry of Fear.
[26.49s -> 34.49s]  As much as that would be cool, I would probably rather stream something like that than to upload like 50 episodes of this onto my YouTube channel.
[34.49s -> 42.49s]  But it's about a 15 minute video condensed kind of highlight reel of some of the scares, some of the funny things that happened, some of the happenings we came across.
[42.49s -> 49.49s]  And that's probably what you're going to get. Like I said, I don't want to have a huge let's play on this channel. It's like, you know, 50 episodes long.
[49.49s -> 56.49s]  I've gone down that path before. As a lot of you guys know, I've done some let's plays and yeah, we're on episode 6. I'm done.
[56.49s -> 62.49s]  But with that said, here is the video guys. Not going to take up any more time. I want to get to the content, obviously.
[62.49s -> 68.49s]  So it's been sunny out. Go outside and go get some sunbathing because I'm about to do it right now, baby. Sunbathing.
[68.49s -> 76.22s]  I'm going to turn up. No, don't. Oh, there's a gun. This is my gun. I can't pick up that 30 semi auto. I cannot pick up.
[76.22s -> 80.22s]  I don't know how to equip it. There's a guy. There's a guy. There's a guy. There's a guy over there. There's a guy over here.
[80.22s -> 84.66s]  He's like shifting around like a freak show. Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him. What do you mean?
[84.66s -> 92.37s]  Don't shoot him. It's a freaking neighborhood. What did you do? Do I have no bullets left?
[92.37s -> 95.37s]  I shot him. Dude, this is such recoil on this gun. It's unbelievable.
[96.37s -> 99.37s]  Help me. Help me stop shooting this guy. Shoot him, please.
[103.53s -> 107.83s]  You do it. I have to change my sensitivity. I can't aim like this.
[107.83s -> 111.83s]  And I'm going to figure out how to equip the G43 semi auto. Give me a sec.
[111.83s -> 116.83s]  I'm going to hide in this dark corner. I'll cover you. If I die, this is all on you.
[116.83s -> 120.20s]  All right. I will cover you. Are you ready now for real?
[120.20s -> 124.20s]  Okay. This game is really laggy. It is like 30 FPS. You're not joking.
[124.20s -> 127.20s]  All right. Well, you have to go. There's a guy. There's a guy. You have the gun.
[127.20s -> 132.20s]  You I have a gun too, but I can't shoot this guy. I just shot him in the balls.
[132.20s -> 137.50s]  These things have. What is that? What do you mean? It's an upside down flying mattress.
[137.50s -> 140.50s]  What? Where? You don't. Okay. You walk down there.
[142.06s -> 152.47s]  Okay. I do see it. What is her? Is it dead? I don't have any bullets left, by the way.
[152.47s -> 158.47s]  Yeah, that's kind of happening. We should. I think in our inventory we have a night stick.
[158.47s -> 162.47s]  I don't know how to equip these into slots. Oh, you just click them in and click.
[162.47s -> 165.47s]  Yeah, I just did that. If you click in, you can like bring them over to slot one.
[165.47s -> 169.47s]  Slot one is one. Slot two is two. Slot three is three. Okay, I got this.
[169.47s -> 176.36s]  All right. I don't have any bullets, so something's going to jump up.
[176.36s -> 180.79s]  Wait, did I just get bullets? I did. Didn't I? No, I didn't. That was you reloading.
[180.79s -> 207.43s]  Yeah. Damn it. Get out of here. What? Game over. I'm so scared. Good idea.
[207.43s -> 213.31s]  Okay. I heard somebody. Is that guy throwing a brick at you?
[213.31s -> 219.32s]  I think it was blood, but it looks like a brick. Is there an invisible person?
[219.32s -> 222.32s]  No, it's the mattress guy. Where is he? Oh, he's right there.
[222.32s -> 232.06s]  Okay. Get out of here. Go back to Ikea. Who thought this was scary?
[232.06s -> 240.73s]  Go back to Jordan's furniture, you piece of crap. The upside down flying mattress man.
[240.73s -> 242.73s]  That is kind of weird. There's more of them. There's more of them.
[242.73s -> 249.91s]  What do you mean there's more? Where are they? Oh, my God. They're like a flock of crows.
[249.91s -> 259.41s]  Is one of them dead? Yes. All right. That one's not dead.
[259.41s -> 265.55s]  He's still sitting there all mattressy. Something else, something else, something else.
[265.55s -> 272.30s]  I heard it. Don't waste ammo. Don't waste ammo. He's stuck behind the bushes.
[272.30s -> 278.44s]  We don't got to worry about this guy. That guy might be a pain in the ass later.
[278.44s -> 282.44s]  We got to go in this way. There's a person in this house as well.
[282.44s -> 288.44s]  There's something in that house. I can see its head. Get guns ready.
[288.44s -> 294.92s]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Is she dead? That was my girlfriend, Jerma.
[294.92s -> 299.61s]  What the hell is that thing from the island of Dr. Moreau?
[299.61s -> 304.61s]  No, that's from XCOM. How many different games of enemies are they going to throw at us?
[304.61s -> 308.61s]  No, that's the thing from the island of Dr. Moreau. Moreau, not Monroe.
[308.61s -> 312.61s]  Who's the fat actor? I'm scared. I can't think.
[312.61s -> 318.87s]  You got to be as crazy as them. All right. Good. What's this box over here?
[318.87s -> 323.62s]  I don't know. Should we open it? Pageant Boy.
[323.62s -> 327.49s]  Can we just jump in the car? Nope, that'd be too easy.
[327.49s -> 333.20s]  Door won't budge. None of these doors budge.
[333.20s -> 339.41s]  Holy. Watch out. We got the Freddy Krueger with the hammers.
[339.41s -> 343.41s]  Freddy Krueger that is being electrocuted.
[343.41s -> 347.71s]  Don't you feel at all cruel for just wailing on the guy?
[347.71s -> 357.99s]  What the fuck is that thing? What is that giant thing?
[357.99s -> 360.99s]  You want to billy club it? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[360.99s -> 365.70s]  I don't know what to do. Should we shoot him?
[365.70s -> 372.12s]  Yeah, I'm shooting him. I got this rifle. I'm out of ammo for it.
[372.12s -> 378.16s]  Should I shoot him in the face? He's dead.
[378.16s -> 382.16s]  That just kind of legitimately freaked me out when I turned in that corner.
[382.16s -> 386.42s]  When he dies, why does he crumple up into like a...
[386.42s -> 390.84s]  What the hell is this? My legs and face. I want to get inside of it.
[390.84s -> 393.84s]  I go down and do a yoga position when I die.
[393.84s -> 395.84s]  Crawl inside. I want to see you inside of it.
[395.84s -> 398.84s]  And his dumb character expression.
[398.84s -> 404.58s]  What do you think you're going to cover me from inside the hole?
[404.58s -> 414.28s]  I'm covering you. Am I on your head?
[414.28s -> 417.28s]  No. How do you get up this?
[417.28s -> 422.49s]  I don't know. I'll give you one hint.
[422.49s -> 426.43s]  I seriously. OK, you have to sprint and do it.
[426.43s -> 430.86s]  That was so that was very dramatic for what to see.
[430.86s -> 433.86s]  You can't do this. I'm sprinting. You got to like sprint.
[433.86s -> 437.66s]  There you go. You got it. This game is good.
[437.66s -> 441.35s]  No more noises. Turn off your flashlight.
[441.35s -> 452.70s]  That's completely silent now. Look what you did. Clear.
[452.70s -> 455.01s]  Anything in here? Anything in here?
[455.01s -> 458.01s]  Oh, on the ground right here. Ammo. Mine.
[458.01s -> 463.01s]  Take it good. I still have some shotgun shells left.
[463.01s -> 466.01s]  I'm not concerned about this. What are we inside of right now?
[466.01s -> 469.70s]  Who built this and for what reason? Yeah, I know.
[469.70s -> 472.70s]  Here's my log cabin. You'll get it. You're the shotgun guy.
[472.70s -> 475.70s]  Where is it over there? I get the cover my tail.
[475.70s -> 480.79s]  You're covering your tail. Here we go. Good.
[480.79s -> 486.45s]  What is this? And where are you? I lost you.
[486.45s -> 490.20s]  Oh, my God. Dude. Where are you?
[490.20s -> 496.81s]  Help me. Where? Oh, my God.
[496.81s -> 508.95s]  Fair. How many ammo? Game over. Game over.
[508.95s -> 511.95s]  Dude, that was ridiculous.
[511.95s -> 514.95s]  Dude, I saw it like the ground was destroyed.
[514.95s -> 516.95s]  It's like, oh, he fell through these stairs. No problem.
[516.95s -> 522.82s]  I'll go and after him. I fell through the stairs.
[522.82s -> 526.18s]  Dude, that was so bad because I lost you and that happened.
[526.18s -> 530.13s]  The first time you go ahead without me. See, I need to.
[530.13s -> 534.14s]  Do we seriously have to go up those stairs? I think we have to.
[534.14s -> 537.14s]  I think that's like that's like an event we have to do.
[537.14s -> 539.82s]  So what we're going to do is we're going to bum rush it.
[539.82s -> 543.70s]  OK, OK. No, no. Here's the thing.
[543.70s -> 547.70s]  We need a strategy for this because we can't just go up these stairs.
[547.70s -> 550.70s]  Don't go yet. Don't know. I'm not going to go.
[550.70s -> 553.70s]  OK, I'm checking my like which gun is going to be the best gun.
[553.70s -> 556.94s]  I'm reloading the Glock. I got two pistols.
[556.94s -> 560.18s]  How do I dual wield these? I don't know.
[560.18s -> 562.18s]  There's a dual wield button, but it like never works for me.
[562.18s -> 567.18s]  Maybe I just was going too fast and we actually don't like you don't have to fall down there.
[567.18s -> 569.18s]  Maybe you can like make it happen and then walk away.
[569.18s -> 572.26s]  All right. Well, whatever happens, I'm coming down after you.
[572.26s -> 579.64s]  Oh, my God. Hold on.
[579.64s -> 582.64s]  You hear them like hustling. Seriously.
[582.64s -> 586.57s]  I searched that I gave me up. That gave me a fucking hot attack.
[586.57s -> 590.26s]  Why are they coming through walls now? It wasn't supposed to.
[590.26s -> 593.26s]  That's the thing. We know what's going to happen. We know they're there.
[593.26s -> 597.84s]  But am I seriously jumping in this first? Go, go.
[597.84s -> 601.46s]  Hold on. I'm figuring out how to dual wield.
[601.46s -> 607.16s]  Give me a break. That was so stupid. It just came through the wall.
[607.16s -> 609.34s]  How do you do this? I don't know, but we got it.
[609.34s -> 612.34s]  We have to just do it. There's no there's really no turning back.
[612.34s -> 623.43s]  It didn't happen. God, Jerma, please, Jerma, please.
[623.43s -> 626.80s]  I don't have any bullets in this gun. We got it.
[626.80s -> 629.98s]  There's one more. I hear like the huh.
[629.98s -> 634.22s]  Nope. No, that's it. I can't believe it.
[634.22s -> 637.22s]  I can't believe we did that. What's what's even back here?
[637.22s -> 640.40s]  Nothing. We had we had to do that so we could go up the stairs again.
[640.40s -> 649.47s]  No. What are we stuck in here? No, there has to be a way to get through that.
[649.47s -> 653.48s]  Can we shoot the what?
[653.48s -> 656.98s]  The accuracy. You are too good.
[656.98s -> 660.98s]  I hear a bunch of noise. I hear like a swarm of bees.
[660.98s -> 665.44s]  Oh, no, not the bees. Oh, no. Do you hear like that swarm of bees?
[665.44s -> 668.62s]  Yeah. Yeah. Get out your billy club for the bees.
[668.62s -> 674.14s]  All right. Let's go. Get in there.
[674.14s -> 679.30s]  Are you kidding me? I don't want to go in here. Do you hear this?
[679.30s -> 683.30s]  That's going to be a chainsaw guy. Oh, my God. It is a chainsaw guy.
[683.30s -> 686.61s]  Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. Let me out.
[686.61s -> 689.91s]  You can't get out now. You commit it here. Here's what you do.
[689.91s -> 692.91s]  OK, let me equip. Am I going to bait this guy for you?
[692.91s -> 694.91s]  Equip this gun. Yeah. And you just bait him.
[694.91s -> 699.86s]  There's a rifle on the ground at your feet. Oh, I hear him.
[699.86s -> 703.30s]  Oh, my God. What is he blending? Damn it, man.
[703.30s -> 707.30s]  He's running a blender. I don't know. I don't know if I can bait him back here.
[707.30s -> 710.98s]  You got it. You got it. No, it's just a lady.
[710.98s -> 714.61s]  Just a stupid, like, lady. There he is. There he is.
[714.61s -> 719.83s]  He killed me. I'm dead. He's going to get you. Oh, my God.
[719.83s -> 723.78s]  That's so fair. We knew he was there.
[723.78s -> 728.47s]  What are you supposed to do? I don't know.
[728.47s -> 731.47s]  Can you? Yeah, I got him. I got him. Oh, my God. He's running.
[731.47s -> 734.84s]  He's running. He can't get through. I don't think he can get through.
[735.84s -> 738.84s]  I just want to say hello.
[738.84s -> 742.78s]  I don't have any ammo. Neither do I.
[742.78s -> 745.34s]  What do we do? I don't know.
[745.34s -> 748.35s]  Is there a door in there? There is.
[748.35s -> 752.04s]  OK, so what we're going to do is we're both going to...
[752.04s -> 756.05s]  Can you can you get in there? Oh, what the...
[756.05s -> 761.14s]  What the hell? I have no idea what we're going to do in this situation.
[761.14s -> 765.86s]  I think we just have to get here with enough ammo.
[765.86s -> 769.10s]  That's the only way we'll be like all those ladies we shot.
[769.10s -> 772.59s]  We should shoot those ladies, Jerma. All right, going in.
[772.59s -> 777.43s]  Oh, my God. He's like...
[777.43s -> 785.01s]  Oh, my God. That was so dumb.
[785.01s -> 789.53s]  If we want things to get spiced up, you know what we got to do?
[789.53s -> 793.28s]  What we got to do? We got to stop being such little punks.
[793.28s -> 796.28s]  Here, we got a gun. I'm just going. Let's go.
[796.28s -> 799.28s]  I'm not waiting for you. We're not taking our time. I'm just running.
[799.28s -> 802.58s]  You're going to run through this? What about the guy with the bag on his head?
[802.58s -> 805.58s]  I don't know. What about him? What about him?
[805.58s -> 807.58s]  He just like punched me and I got like drunk.
[807.58s -> 810.58s]  It's not even a bag. Wait, what is this? Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
[810.58s -> 816.19s]  I'm getting hurt. Yeah, I am. What is hitting me?
[816.19s -> 819.19s]  No, it's this guy. Is he breathing on us too hard?
[819.19s -> 823.19s]  I don't know, but his like bad breath is giving us like a headache.
[823.19s -> 829.57s]  What the hell just happened? I killed him and he's speaker phone the hell out of there.
[829.57s -> 832.57s]  I don't have any bullets. I need a syringe if we find one.
[832.57s -> 836.32s]  I'm out. I got this assault rifle, but...
[836.32s -> 843.19s]  I am out. I'll take this. I'm dropping this for you. Thank you.
[843.19s -> 846.56s]  I don't know how quickly you do this because I'm quicking.
[846.56s -> 850.38s]  I'm going the other way. I'm going the other way.
[863.79s -> 867.79s]  I don't have any bullets. I don't have any bullets.
[871.18s -> 876.24s]  I have to equip the branch. Where's the branch?
[876.24s -> 879.24s]  Oh, he's glitched out. Quick, come on.
[879.24s -> 882.61s]  I'm dead, Jerma. I can't see.
[882.61s -> 885.61s]  You can't see me right here? I can see you standing on me, but that's it.
[885.61s -> 896.45s]  Who else wants some? Oh, yeah, you can dodge.
[896.45s -> 898.45s]  I forgot about that. Oh, wow, you can.
[898.45s -> 904.63s]  There's the dodge button. That's why my, like, double tap forward or back.
[904.63s -> 909.32s]  Oh, okay. That's why I was like, oh, my character freaked out.
[909.32s -> 916.32s]  I hear the bees. There's the guy.
[919.22s -> 923.09s]  Oh, Jesus. Game over.
