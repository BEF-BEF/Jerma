[0.31s -> 14.86s]  Once we turn this corner, you're probably gonna kill a lot of people.
[14.86s -> 17.32s]  This should be fun.
[17.32s -> 18.62s]  Alright, you ready?
[18.62s -> 19.62s]  Where'd the sniper come from?
[19.62s -> 22.69s]  Right when you come out here.
[22.69s -> 25.44s]  Oh, come on!
[25.44s -> 27.44s]  That would've been so epic.
[27.44s -> 30.94s]  If you had just jumped out here and there was like a dozen people.
[30.94s -> 33.38s]  That was anticlimactic.
[33.38s -> 37.02s]  Yeah, just a little bit.
[37.02s -> 39.02s]  Look at this big, handsome Russian.
[39.02s -> 41.96s]  Ha ha!
[42.46s -> 47.99s]  What was he a spy?
[47.99s -> 49.99s]  Oh no, he changed him. Shit.
[54.06s -> 56.75s]  That was the stupidest thing ever.
[57.75s -> 61.06s]  He looks conspicuous. Oh, ready to give him a sandwich.
[61.06s -> 62.06s]  Oh, I got him.
[62.06s -> 64.36s]  Oh, I think I gave it to the sniper by accident.
[65.36s -> 68.36s]  Dude, you just walked up and just like, yeah, like punched that guy.
[68.36s -> 69.36s]  He just like, groaned. That was great.
[69.36s -> 70.36s]  He changed him.
[70.36s -> 71.36s]  That was great.
[71.36s -> 73.36s]  You guys could not have planned that.
[73.36s -> 75.66s]  That was fantastic.
[75.66s -> 79.35s]  I'm so glad I'm recording that right now because I'm probably gonna put it somewhere.
[79.85s -> 82.67s]  Yeah, definitely. That was funny.
[82.67s -> 85.48s]  Uh-oh. Oh, here we go.
[85.48s -> 87.48s]  Oh, nope.
[87.48s -> 88.66s]  Damn it.
[88.66s -> 89.66s]  They're just rolling it.
[89.66s -> 92.90s]  I feel like every time we get up here, it's like, just the most...
[92.90s -> 94.90s]  I feel like we're in like a movie and there's nothing ever happening.
[94.90s -> 95.90s]  We're gonna win, right?
[95.90s -> 99.23s]  You know what? Here, just...
[99.23s -> 105.72s]  Yeah, I'm done.
[105.72s -> 107.72s]  Oh, where did you come from?
[107.72s -> 109.47s]  There was a scout behind me.
[109.47s -> 110.47s]  A lot of stuff going on.
[110.47s -> 113.47s]  Oh, I can't go up there with you, man. I'm gonna get destroyed.
[113.47s -> 115.47s]  And there's a spy right here. Get hit with a guy with a beard.
[115.47s -> 116.77s]  Shit.
[116.77s -> 121.56s]  Oh, he actually got the point. Shit.
[122.06s -> 123.06s]  That's... What?
[123.06s -> 124.23s]  Wait a second.
[124.23s -> 125.23s]  Oh, he's real.
[125.23s -> 126.23s]  Hold on a second. He's real?
[126.23s -> 127.23s]  He is real.
[127.23s -> 128.47s]  I shot him. He walked through me.
[128.47s -> 130.53s]  Oh, wow.
[134.07s -> 140.34s]  All right, let's do the pyro behind.
[140.34s -> 141.34s]  Sandwiches.
[141.34s -> 142.34s]  I got you. Come here, brah.
[142.34s -> 143.34s]  Come here, brah.
[143.34s -> 146.95s]  Oh, okay.
[146.95s -> 149.77s]  Why are we all still just like standing here?
[149.77s -> 151.77s]  Is this not the right capture point?
[151.77s -> 153.77s]  I feel like this guy's a spy, man. Every time.
[153.77s -> 156.26s]  He's just holding the syringe gun.
[156.26s -> 161.98s]  Boy Who Cried Wolf. One of these times, someone's gonna come behind us and it's gonna actually be a spy.
[161.98s -> 165.97s]  Oh, come here.
[165.97s -> 168.34s]  Oh, this guy needs it more.
[169.46s -> 171.53s]  Yeah, I'll grab a health kit.
[171.53s -> 172.53s]  All right, I got crits.
[172.53s -> 177.23s]  Here we go.
[177.23s -> 180.20s]  Here we go.
[180.20s -> 184.61s]  Let's overheal the hell out of everybody.
[184.61s -> 186.56s]  This pyro.
[186.56s -> 187.56s]  And...
[187.56s -> 188.56s]  Let me know when you want it.
[188.56s -> 195.20s]  Wait till we see a bunch.
[195.20s -> 197.08s]  Oh, come here.
[197.08s -> 203.37s]  Yikes.
[203.37s -> 204.37s]  Is the healing beam even on you?
[204.37s -> 205.37s]  Why is it going the...
[205.37s -> 206.37s]  What's going on here?
[206.37s -> 207.37s]  Why is it going the other direction?
[207.37s -> 208.37s]  Did you get a headshot?
[208.37s -> 209.68s]  Yeah.
[209.68s -> 210.68s]  Oh, dear.
[210.68s -> 211.85s]  Are you a spy?
[211.85s -> 212.85s]  No, you're not.
[212.85s -> 215.60s]  I'm gonna use this crits, man.
[215.60s -> 217.74s]  It's holding on to this.
[217.74s -> 218.92s]  Yeah, it's popping on anybody.
[218.92s -> 221.18s]  All right, Ryan.
[221.18s -> 222.48s]  I hope you're ready.
[222.98s -> 225.54s]  They're gonna come from over there.
[225.54s -> 228.49s]  And we're gonna need you.
[228.49s -> 229.49s]  Oh, baby.
[229.49s -> 230.86s]  One more.
[230.86s -> 233.06s]  Yes.
[233.06s -> 234.42s]  And we're gonna...
[234.42s -> 239.52s]  Oh, good thing we killed that one heavy...
[239.52s -> 242.59s]  This is so, like...
[242.59s -> 246.30s]  That's a pretty awesome arrow.
[246.30s -> 251.06s]  This guy looks like he's literally just standing here guarding the door like a bouncer.
[251.06s -> 255.15s]  Hey, quote on the cop.
[255.15s -> 261.45s]  What's up, buddy?
[261.45s -> 265.74s]  Come here, Mr. Green Acid Face.
[265.74s -> 267.74s]  Now, let's see how many people liking beard in a row.
[267.74s -> 270.11s]  Here we go.
[270.11s -> 271.11s]  I'm gonna go for some beards.
[271.11s -> 273.82s]  You wanna get bearded?
[274.32s -> 275.50s]  You wanna get hit with a beard?
[275.50s -> 277.06s]  Come on.
[277.06s -> 278.30s]  Come on out.
[278.30s -> 280.54s]  This guy is afraid of me.
[280.54s -> 282.54s]  And I literally am holding the beard as a medic.
[282.54s -> 284.54s]  I'm holding the do-no-harm thing.
[284.54s -> 285.84s]  Let's go.
[285.84s -> 286.84s]  Here we go.
[286.84s -> 287.84s]  Going in.
[287.84s -> 289.02s]  Oh, you wanna go?
[289.02s -> 290.64s]  Going in hot.
[290.64s -> 291.64s]  Going in hot.
[291.64s -> 292.82s]  Come on, man.
[292.82s -> 294.19s]  Really?
[294.19s -> 295.19s]  What?
[295.19s -> 296.19s]  You're not gonna do it?
[296.19s -> 297.19s]  I'm following you.
[297.19s -> 298.19s]  I'm gonna follow you all the way to where...
[298.19s -> 299.81s]  Oh, you prick.
[299.81s -> 300.81s]  I'm still gonna get him.
[300.81s -> 302.37s]  I'm still gonna get him.
[302.37s -> 308.09s]  Oh!
[308.09s -> 309.09s]  I got crits.
[309.09s -> 310.09s]  I don't know who the hell...
[310.09s -> 311.46s]  There's only two snipers here.
[311.46s -> 312.46s]  Crits behind you.
[312.96s -> 313.96s]  Turn around, please.
[313.96s -> 317.31s]  Turn around.
[317.31s -> 324.06s]  Well, he died.
[324.06s -> 325.06s]  They got a sentry.
[325.06s -> 326.06s]  Oh, this is gonna be hard.
[326.06s -> 328.23s]  Yeah, that sentry's looking at me funny.
[328.23s -> 331.35s]  I'm just sitting here with this guy.
[331.35s -> 334.55s]  Get, like, a nice hefty over-heel.
[334.55s -> 336.43s]  Thank you.
[336.43s -> 337.43s]  Ah, it's a demo, man.
[337.43s -> 338.43s]  And he missed.
[343.66s -> 344.66s]  I'm just sitting here.
[344.66s -> 345.66s]  This guy is so ridiculous.
[345.66s -> 346.66s]  This guy's insane.
[346.66s -> 350.22s]  This guy's just getting, like, headshots over and over again.
[350.22s -> 351.22s]  I'm just, like, protecting him.
[351.22s -> 354.50s]  Pocket sniper.
[354.50s -> 356.64s]  I don't know.
[356.64s -> 358.82s]  That's not such a good idea anymore.
[358.82s -> 360.38s]  Come to me.
[360.88s -> 365.88s]  Oh, thanks.
[365.88s -> 367.88s]  So, this is a very unsafe door.
[367.88s -> 369.12s]  Oh, boy.
[369.12s -> 370.12s]  Yeah, this is not...
[370.12s -> 371.12s]  Almost hit me in the head.
[371.12s -> 374.98s]  It's not a good place to be.
[374.98s -> 376.16s]  Sentry.
[376.16s -> 377.16s]  Is the sentry still there?
[377.16s -> 378.16s]  No.
[378.16s -> 379.72s]  Dead with a spy, I think.
[379.72s -> 380.72s]  I got a charge.
[380.72s -> 381.72s]  Are there any, like, power classes around here?
[381.72s -> 382.72s]  Oh, the sentry's at the back.
[382.72s -> 383.72s]  Oh, no!
[383.72s -> 384.72s]  Oh, no!
[384.72s -> 386.02s]  Oh, no!
[386.02s -> 387.45s]  Get away from me!
[387.45s -> 388.45s]  Eat beard!
[388.45s -> 389.45s]  I just lagged, but please let...
[389.45s -> 390.45s]  What the hell is going on?
[390.45s -> 396.48s]  I was about to make fun of myself.
[396.48s -> 400.04s]  And this guy, when he makes the step over here, is dead.
[400.04s -> 402.04s]  Heavy, when you come out, I'm waiting for the heavy.
[402.04s -> 403.04s]  Specifically.
[403.04s -> 404.54s]  Just to make, like, a point.
[404.54s -> 408.96s]  Where is he?
[408.96s -> 412.46s]  If this is not the most obvious spy in the world, I really don't know what it is.
[412.46s -> 414.46s]  I'm standing here.
[414.46s -> 419.19s]  Fuck you, Jared.
[419.19s -> 421.25s]  Go back to Subway.
[421.25s -> 422.75s]  Please just roll us right now.
[422.75s -> 427.68s]  Oh, my God!
[427.68s -> 431.01s]  What did I just do?
[437.44s -> 438.44s]  Dude, I just...
[438.44s -> 443.26s]  Oh, my...
[443.26s -> 444.89s]  All right, dude.
[444.89s -> 445.89s]  Okay, so I just...
[445.89s -> 448.39s]  You know, when you use the huntsman, you just, like, come out and, like, block...
[448.39s -> 450.39s]  By the way, I'm so glad this is over.
[450.39s -> 452.13s]  We just, like, lost.
[452.13s -> 456.63s]  All right, so, you know, you ever just use the huntsman, and you just blind fire randomly, just, like, knock an arrow for fun?
[456.63s -> 461.63s]  I just did that out of the spawn door, and I headshot a guy on our own team who was a spy, and he had him in the face.
[461.63s -> 463.13s]  He was, like, all the way down.
[463.13s -> 464.13s]  That was ridiculous.
[464.13s -> 466.75s]  That guy's probably so pissed.
