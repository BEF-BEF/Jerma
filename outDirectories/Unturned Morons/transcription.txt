[6.20s -> 18.62s]  Hello, it's Traveler. I got you. What the hell is your character? What's your name? What is your name?
[19.99s -> 27.10s]  You look like Elmo. Don't do that. I'm gonna die now. Yeah, I'm gonna bleed to death now. Did you slice him?
[27.10s -> 32.97s]  Yeah, he sliced me. I'm dead. I'm just looking at the screen right now. It's just 19, 18, 17, 16.
[32.97s -> 38.98s]  Hold on, I can do something. Hold on, hold on. I have a... You better hurry up, whatever the hell
[38.98s -> 48.82s]  you're gonna do. You! Oh, you're a zombie? Well, hello zombie. I've got pocket knife. All right,
[48.82s -> 53.54s]  let's also save all the looting and stuff for when we actually meet up. We just get like a melee
[53.54s -> 59.56s]  weapon. I broke my leg by the way. I was climbing, I climbed up this ladder to try to find like just
[59.56s -> 68.79s]  like a weapon and I slid down and broke my like femur. So I'm gonna have like a bro, a handsaw.
[68.79s -> 76.01s]  Good, here we go. Come on! I've got legitimately like 30 zombies on me. Yeah, there's so many.
[78.54s -> 88.78s]  Get away from me, back! Back, you vile spawn of Satan! These guys are gonna kill me. Why does the
[88.78s -> 95.90s]  handsaw suck? Holy shit, this item is terrible! I'm dead. Well, you're trying to kill zombies
[95.90s -> 104.01s]  with a saw. What do you expect? I think I'm at pizza again. Oh, there's a lot of zombies here.
[104.01s -> 109.21s]  Yeah, just be careful. It's out, it's out, it's out. No gas. Oh, that one does not have any gas.
[109.21s -> 114.94s]  I'm at pizza again. All right, well you are currently getting swarmed. Yeah, no joke.
[117.86s -> 125.72s]  Don't die. I haven't got hit yet. Oh, that's a fast one. That's a fast one. He's fast.
[125.72s -> 130.76s]  Where's the katana man? Yeah, you have to run to me. I'm running to you. Just kill the fast one
[130.76s -> 138.22s]  behind me. That's it. Just backpedal, backpedal while you do it. Okay, I don't think I want to
[138.22s -> 147.29s]  do that. Oh, sledgehammer. All right guys, we finally met up three friends. What do you guys
[147.29s -> 156.73s]  want to do? What the hell? Is that a door? The shield stay on your side. Your arms are just
[156.73s -> 161.77s]  coming through. Hey, dude, it took us seriously like an hour and 15 minutes to find each other.
[162.97s -> 174.06s]  Do not just to start attacking. Are there no headlights on this car? Oh, there we go. All
[174.06s -> 179.10s]  right, let's do it. If you turn around, you can see Jarvan sitting in the back. That's funny.
[179.10s -> 183.74s]  I'm going to sit in the back with him. He looks lonely. All right, I have no idea where I'm going,
[183.74s -> 190.44s]  by the way. Sit back here with me. Hey, is there a military base? No, I did not mean to do that.
[190.44s -> 193.96s]  I didn't mean to do that. Did you hit him? I'm not going to tell you what happened,
[193.96s -> 198.65s]  because I don't want this to turn bad, so no. I'm trying to do it. How do I hit you?
[198.65s -> 205.27s]  You can't. Only I can, apparently. All right, let's go. You can shoot out of the windows.
[205.27s -> 210.42s]  How? If you have guns. I don't know. Can I shoot him in the back seat? Don't even tell me.
[210.42s -> 217.93s]  Seriously, don't. Don't even seriously. Hey! Oh, you killed me.
[232.55s -> 240.28s]  Why? I didn't think I was going to instantly kill you. I'm crying right now.
[241.50s -> 249.70s]  I really didn't think that was going to instantly kill you. Instantly. Dude, I thought it was just
[249.70s -> 257.93s]  going to be like when I hit him, it was just like boop. A zombie. Oh, no. Whoa. Whoa.
[261.70s -> 268.15s]  What the hell, dude? He wasn't even in here. What happened? He's dead now. I almost died.
[270.34s -> 277.58s]  Snuck up on him when I was looting. I took some vitamins. Did they give you help?
[277.58s -> 286.04s]  No. Oh, I guess maybe they do. Hey, Jeremy, get out of that building real quick. That car's
[286.04s -> 300.17s]  about to explode. What car? No, that car. What are you grunting for? There's so many zombies.
[303.98s -> 308.78s]  You better get out of that car. I'm out. It's going to blow you up. You're still too close,
[308.78s -> 320.01s]  probably. Can you kill this guy? I only have 35%. There's bandages in here. There's vitamins
[320.01s -> 328.65s]  in here. All right, let's get them. They've trapped me. No, I can't get in there. Don't worry. I got
[328.65s -> 337.91s]  you. I got you. Jeez. Punch him. Punch him. Punch him. There's an island with a helicopter down
[337.91s -> 342.63s]  there. Oh, you're in the island with the downed helicopter? That's what I've been saying. Wait,
[343.11s -> 356.52s]  let me look through my binoculars. I see him. I'm so glad we found him. Italics, land ho. Whoa.
[357.58s -> 364.23s]  All right, you guys don't do it. I think I found food and I think I'm holding it in my hand now.
[364.23s -> 370.50s]  But I think I want to eat it. You're going to give that food to me? I'm at 18%. I want to put
[370.50s -> 377.86s]  that back down to zero. I have 85%. You're dropping that food. Put that food down. Put it down.
[377.94s -> 388.26s]  Come on. I will catch up to you. We got a runner. I'm at 90. I can't believe you ate that food.
[388.26s -> 393.10s]  He dropped it. He dropped it. It's on the ground.
