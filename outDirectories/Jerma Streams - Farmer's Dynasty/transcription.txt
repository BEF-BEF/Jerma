[4.47s -> 10.78s]  How you doing, everybody? Hope you're doing good.
[10.78s -> 16.50s]  Wait, hold on, hold on. My microphone's not here.
[16.50s -> 20.50s]  Hold on, my microphone's... I cleaned up my office.
[20.50s -> 24.50s]  Like, you remember, my microphone's like in a different place. Wait.
[24.50s -> 61.97s]  I was wondering. I was like, I can see my voice over there, but it looks very low. It still does. I fucked it up.
[61.97s -> 80.70s]  Is that better? I think that's better. Alright, okay. Anyways.
[80.70s -> 84.90s]  Hi guys, welcome to the stream.
[84.90s -> 94.96s]  Yes, I know, I know. The only thing anybody can talk about right now is, dude, that half-life trailer.
[94.96s -> 104.06s]  I know. I haven't even seen it yet. I haven't watched it, and I'm not going to.
[104.06s -> 117.13s]  I'm kidding. Alright, alright. I haven't seen the trailer.
[117.13s -> 123.14s]  So I was thinking, you know, what if we like do a little bit of watch the video and watch it and react to it?
[123.14s -> 125.14s]  You know, like, that's what I'm gonna do.
[125.14s -> 129.50s]  We're gonna get a live, real reaction of not seeing the trailer.
[129.50s -> 137.29s]  The trailer's like a minute and fifteen seconds long, so it's not like we'll be here for a very long time.
[137.29s -> 143.23s]  And also, what we're doing today... I gotta take a step back.
[143.23s -> 148.23s]  Because think about the last week or so of streams. Dead Rising...
[148.23s -> 150.79s]  Or is this Stressful?
[150.79s -> 154.79s]  Dead Rising 2, super stressful, beat the game time limits and all that shit.
[154.79s -> 160.29s]  I have Sekiro, I think like a year ago. I'm still feeling that one.
[160.29s -> 164.13s]  I want to slow down a little.
[164.13s -> 166.13s]  Bombo was stressful. Exactly, that's what I'm saying.
[166.13s -> 170.62s]  So, we're gonna play Farmer's Dynasty.
[170.62s -> 178.98s]  I was gonna play Hand Simulator, but everybody made fun of me in the pre-stream chat.
[178.98s -> 184.54s]  It was like people were just making fun of me, so I was like, okay, I guess I'm not gonna play that one.
[188.28s -> 192.28s]  And yes, I am aware that this is not...
[192.28s -> 198.28s]  This is not like Farming Simulator 2019. This is Farmer's Dynasty.
[198.28s -> 201.28s]  It just released on Steam.
[201.28s -> 204.89s]  So, I don't know. I just...
[204.89s -> 209.26s]  I said it because I was being a dick.
[209.26s -> 211.26s]  And I was like, oh, I'm thinking about playing Hand Simulator.
[211.26s -> 216.26s]  Everyone's like, if you're Tuber, okay, Tuber, that's stupid, that game sucks meme.
[216.26s -> 218.26s]  And I was like, all right, fine, Farmer's Dynasty.
[218.26s -> 220.26s]  And all of a sudden, you know what happens.
[220.26s -> 227.08s]  Yeah, yeah, do that, yeah.
[235.14s -> 244.65s]  So, if you guys have not figured it out yet, pre-stream chat has a lot...
[244.65s -> 248.65s]  There's a lot of influence when I'm in that pre-stream chat.
[248.65s -> 253.74s]  There are like at least a couple hundred one-guy scenarios.
[253.74s -> 255.74s]  You want to be the one guy?
[255.74s -> 260.05s]  Go to the pre-stream chat when I'm just hanging out for 20, 30 minutes before the stream.
[260.05s -> 266.63s]  You get like a buff to your one-guy influence in the pre-stream chat.
[266.63s -> 274.58s]  But anyways, let's watch this trailer.
[274.58s -> 279.68s]  Well, that's not the trailer, but I'm going to put it over that.
[279.68s -> 284.54s]  Wait, are we going to be able to hear...
[284.54s -> 286.54s]  I'm going to turn the music down here.
[286.54s -> 290.06s]  No, there is no music. All right, that's fine.
[290.06s -> 292.69s]  Give me a second. All right, let's watch it. Let's see it.
[292.69s -> 295.69s]  I want to see it. I haven't seen it.
[295.69s -> 302.23s]  Put on face cam? I do not have a shirt on, so I'm not going to put on face cam.
[302.23s -> 303.23s]  It's not going to happen.
[303.23s -> 310.59s]  All right, I got the YouTube link.
[310.59s -> 311.96s]  This is the right one, right?
[311.96s -> 315.96s]  Okay, here's the problem. Whenever you have a game like this come out,
[315.96s -> 321.20s]  you know how many random potential Half-Life fan-made trailers there are?
[321.20s -> 324.20s]  Half-Life. Alex Vance.
[324.20s -> 327.20s]  Somebody could have made this as a machinima.
[327.20s -> 328.82s]  There's a lot of them.
[328.82s -> 331.90s]  Let me make sure I got the right one.
[331.90s -> 340.98s]  This is the right one, right?
[340.98s -> 343.50s]  I haven't fucking seen this.
[343.50s -> 344.50s]  I haven't seen this.
[344.50s -> 345.74s]  What the hell is that?
[345.74s -> 346.74s]  Who's breathing?
[346.74s -> 350.52s]  Is this part of the trailer?
[350.52s -> 351.52s]  No, no, no, no!
[351.52s -> 352.52s]  No, don't start it yet.
[352.52s -> 353.52s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[353.52s -> 357.38s]  Fuck.
[357.38s -> 358.82s]  All right, hold on.
[358.82s -> 359.82s]  Everyone slow down.
[359.82s -> 364.70s]  Hold on.
[364.70s -> 365.70s]  Wait, everybody wait.
[365.70s -> 366.70s]  Oh, I blew it.
[366.70s -> 368.70s]  I actually did blow it.
[368.70s -> 379.80s]  Okay, here we go.
[379.80s -> 381.30s]  I haven't seen this.
[381.30s -> 383.30s]  Why is close captioning on?
[383.30s -> 386.46s]  Is this HD?
[386.46s -> 388.91s]  What's this?
[388.91s -> 389.91s]  360p.
[389.91s -> 392.98s]  1440p.
[392.98s -> 393.98s]  I can't do it.
[393.98s -> 394.98s]  My computer can't handle that.
[394.98s -> 395.98s]  All right, here we go.
[395.98s -> 396.98s]  I'm ready.
[396.98s -> 398.22s]  Three.
[398.22s -> 399.22s]  Two.
[399.22s -> 402.32s]  Three.
[402.32s -> 403.32s]  Two.
[403.32s -> 404.32s]  One.
[404.32s -> 405.32s]  Go.
[405.32s -> 418.58s]  I can turn the volume up.
[418.58s -> 419.58s]  Three.
[419.58s -> 420.58s]  Two.
[420.58s -> 441.91s]  One.
[441.91s -> 442.91s]  I'm here.
[442.91s -> 444.15s]  So what's the plan?
[444.15s -> 445.15s]  We can get this weapon.
[445.15s -> 448.15s]  What we're doing here could change things forever.
[448.15s -> 453.06s]  There's no straight shot to the vault.
[453.06s -> 454.06s]  Electricity.
[454.06s -> 455.06s]  Electricity.
[455.06s -> 456.06s]  Find a way out.
[456.06s -> 457.06s]  Oh, more electricity.
[457.06s -> 460.55s]  I'm with you every step of the way.
[460.55s -> 461.55s]  Old guy.
[461.55s -> 465.99s]  You're going to need a gun.
[465.99s -> 466.99s]  It's unloaded now.
[466.99s -> 467.99s]  Nope.
[467.99s -> 477.23s]  They know you're coming.
[477.23s -> 485.26s]  You need to get out of here now.
[485.26s -> 486.26s]  Nice.
[486.26s -> 487.26s]  That looks cool.
[487.26s -> 488.26s]  Oh, God.
[488.26s -> 489.26s]  They've got Dad.
[489.26s -> 493.26s]  They're going to find out what he knows, and then they're going to kill him.
[493.26s -> 494.26s]  Oh, this is my father.
[494.26s -> 495.26s]  I never told you.
[495.26s -> 496.26s]  I couldn't.
[496.26s -> 497.26s]  I'm so sorry, baby.
[497.26s -> 499.26s]  You will not save him.
[499.26s -> 503.26s]  Alex Bams alone cannot prevent his fate.
[503.26s -> 505.26s]  Open your eyes, Harry.
[505.26s -> 518.53s]  Electricity.
[519.53s -> 528.18s]  Sweat is pouring down my fucking underarms right now.
[528.18s -> 535.01s]  My underarms are crying.
[535.01s -> 536.01s]  Yeah, I know.
[536.01s -> 538.01s]  I can't believe it.
[538.01s -> 541.01s]  I can't believe they got the default skin from Garry's Mod.
[541.01s -> 542.63s]  Wow.
[542.63s -> 544.63s]  I can't wait to play this.
[544.63s -> 550.22s]  VR only?
[550.22s -> 551.22s]  What?
[551.22s -> 553.23s]  What the?
[553.23s -> 554.23s]  That looks...
[554.23s -> 555.23s]  I don't know.
[555.23s -> 562.89s]  There's a lot of electricity, a lot of electric moves, a lot of electric puzzles.
[562.89s -> 563.89s]  I don't know.
[563.89s -> 564.89s]  It looks good.
[564.89s -> 565.89s]  It looks like it could be good.
[565.89s -> 567.89s]  It looks like it could be funny and interesting.
[567.89s -> 569.89s]  And the weapons look really great.
[569.89s -> 578.46s]  The way that you load the guns and everything.
[578.46s -> 579.46s]  It's that new controller.
[579.46s -> 582.46s]  It's going to be the new Knuckles controller.
[582.46s -> 586.46s]  And like, I'm going to have to get them because of how would you not get them?
[586.46s -> 595.78s]  Well, see, apparently I've been told that this is a full video game.
[595.78s -> 600.78s]  This is not just like a three hour Knuckles tech demo, right?
[600.78s -> 605.52s]  So this is like a 12 to 15 hour game.
[605.52s -> 609.10s]  That's the first time that's ever happened.
[609.10s -> 615.10s]  I don't think there has been a VR game that's like a full VR experience.
[615.10s -> 617.10s]  That's been more than like four or five hours.
[617.10s -> 619.94s]  Resident Evil 7?
[619.94s -> 621.94s]  No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[621.94s -> 624.94s]  I'm talking a only VR.
[624.94s -> 627.94s]  Only, only, only VR only.
[627.94s -> 630.87s]  Not Resident Evil 7.
[630.87s -> 631.87s]  You could play...
[631.87s -> 633.87s]  Resident Evil 7 was a game you could play on your PlayStation.
[633.87s -> 634.87s]  On your Xbox.
[634.87s -> 637.62s]  VR only.
[637.62s -> 640.40s]  Skyrim.
[640.40s -> 642.40s]  Did somebody just say Skyrim?
[642.40s -> 644.28s]  Yeah.
[644.28s -> 647.28s]  On the ninth time they released that game, you could play it in VR.
[647.28s -> 652.23s]  No, I'm talking ground up VR only.
[652.23s -> 656.05s]  You couldn't play Resident Evil 7 VR only.
[656.05s -> 660.05s]  In fact, you could only play it on PlayStation VR for the first like six months.
[660.05s -> 664.06s]  Everybody on PC played that with keyboard and mouse.
[664.06s -> 667.92s]  Rick and Morty.
[667.92s -> 674.32s]  Fucking Rick and Morty.
[674.32s -> 682.02s]  Rick and Morty is like a four hour game.
[682.02s -> 683.02s]  It'll be nice to see that though.
[683.02s -> 687.18s]  I'm looking forward to it.
[687.18s -> 688.18s]  Alright, so let's see.
[688.18s -> 689.18s]  What's the internet have to say about this?
[689.18s -> 691.18s]  What does the internet think?
[691.18s -> 701.08s]  We got 155,000 likes and 4.2 thousand dislikes.
[701.08s -> 703.08s]  So 4200 dislikes.
[703.08s -> 705.08s]  155,000 likes.
[705.08s -> 709.11s]  Seems like people are taking it pretty well.
[709.11s -> 711.11s]  The internet thinks you should play Farmer's Dynasty.
[711.11s -> 716.62s]  Are you sure?
[716.62s -> 720.24s]  If I had a like and dislike ratio on this stream,
[720.24s -> 723.42s]  the second that this trailer comes down,
[723.42s -> 728.59s]  would probably be like 30 to 70 percent like to dislike.
[728.59s -> 731.59s]  So I don't know if you're correct on that.
[731.59s -> 736.73s]  I think you're actually incorrect.
[736.73s -> 737.73s]  Just wait.
[737.73s -> 738.73s]  You guys are going to just wait.
[738.73s -> 740.73s]  I think I picked a good one.
[740.73s -> 742.22s]  Alright, let's go.
[742.22s -> 743.22s]  That was cool.
[743.22s -> 744.22s]  I'm sure it'll be fun.
[744.22s -> 749.38s]  They wouldn't have waited this long and put this much time into it
[749.38s -> 752.38s]  if it wasn't going to be at least a fun game.
[752.38s -> 757.66s]  We'll find out when I play it on day one.
[757.66s -> 758.66s]  That's right.
[758.66s -> 759.66s]  I've got an announcement of my own.
[759.66s -> 766.76s]  On day one of the launch of Half-Life VR,
[766.76s -> 768.76s]  I'm going to play it on this channel.
[768.76s -> 770.76s]  What an announcement that I have for you, right?
[770.76s -> 776.38s]  The thing that somebody put tons of awesome time into,
[776.38s -> 778.38s]  I'm going to play it.
[778.38s -> 781.39s]  What a fucking announcement.
[781.39s -> 784.23s]  Shit, this is loud.
[784.23s -> 788.71s]  Upgrade my PC.
[788.71s -> 793.68s]  By then, I'll have at least another fucking 780.
[793.68s -> 796.97s]  You guys ready?
[796.97s -> 801.06s]  Can we go now?
[801.06s -> 803.06s]  Day one first minute?
[803.06s -> 807.14s]  No, there's no way I'm going to be the first person that plays that game.
[807.14s -> 812.66s]  Somebody from like fucking Russia will have like a leaked copy
[812.66s -> 814.66s]  two, three weeks before it.
[814.66s -> 817.66s]  It'll stream it for like 40 minutes before they get removed.
[817.66s -> 819.66s]  So I won't be the first person that plays it.
[819.66s -> 832.12s]  When I'm allowed to, I will.
[832.12s -> 837.71s]  You guys ready?
[837.71s -> 843.32s]  Move to Russia.
[843.32s -> 847.32s]  Some random person from like, I don't know, like Australia or something
[847.32s -> 851.32s]  will end up having like a copy from some Australian GameStop.
[851.32s -> 855.67s]  New quest.
[855.67s -> 856.67s]  Talk to Oliver.
[856.67s -> 859.67s]  Since your grandfather passed away, he has kept an eye on your farm.
[859.67s -> 860.67s]  He'll show you around.
[860.67s -> 862.67s]  That's a bomb you're dropping on me.
[862.67s -> 865.94s]  You're losing food from the pantry.
[865.94s -> 867.94s]  A cat should keep mice at bay.
[867.94s -> 870.94s]  First, my grandfather dies and now my cat's...
[870.94s -> 871.94s]  What's going on?
[871.94s -> 872.94s]  Hold on.
[872.94s -> 877.52s]  This is the sensitivity is too high.
[877.52s -> 882.49s]  That's controller sensitivity.
[882.49s -> 889.62s]  Wait, is there a controls?
[889.62s -> 893.20s]  Keyboard.
[893.20s -> 895.02s]  Change the currency.
[895.02s -> 896.02s]  I already did.
[896.02s -> 899.69s]  All right.
[899.69s -> 900.69s]  We got...
[900.69s -> 901.69s]  I might have to...
[901.69s -> 902.69s]  I'm your neighbor.
[902.69s -> 903.69s]  My name's Oliver.
[903.69s -> 907.86s]  I've been looking after this farm since your grandfather passed away.
[907.86s -> 910.36s]  Nice to meet you, Oliver.
[910.36s -> 911.36s]  I appreciate your help.
[911.36s -> 912.36s]  Oh, damn it.
[912.36s -> 913.36s]  This is my heritage.
[913.36s -> 914.36s]  Game already sucks.
[914.36s -> 917.36s]  Not a silent protagonist.
[917.36s -> 929.71s]  Why am I dressed like this then?
[929.71s -> 932.85s]  Why does he not have the belt?
[932.85s -> 935.85s]  Why do we keep doing the T-pose stretch?
[935.85s -> 938.86s]  I'll show you around.
[938.86s -> 939.86s]  Hold on.
[939.86s -> 942.10s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[942.10s -> 947.82s]  Hold on.
[947.82s -> 948.82s]  That's a little better.
[948.82s -> 949.82s]  I can feel the view.
[949.82s -> 950.82s]  Best quality.
[950.82s -> 951.82s]  Let's go.
[951.82s -> 953.57s]  Okay.
[953.57s -> 954.57s]  Follow Oliver.
[954.57s -> 957.09s]  All right.
[957.09s -> 958.09s]  Where's the punch?
[958.09s -> 960.86s]  He'll talk later.
[960.86s -> 963.77s]  How do you...
[963.77s -> 964.77s]  I want to walk.
[964.77s -> 966.71s]  No, that's sprint.
[966.71s -> 969.71s]  I think I might actually use a controller for this.
[969.71s -> 970.71s]  It's kind of...
[970.71s -> 971.71s]  It's a little painful.
[971.71s -> 972.71s]  Is VSync on?
[972.71s -> 973.71s]  No.
[973.71s -> 975.98s]  No, I got to turn it on.
[975.98s -> 980.75s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[980.75s -> 982.75s]  I don't want it in a different language.
[982.75s -> 987.00s]  Holy shit, you've got it.
[987.00s -> 989.00s]  This has been localized in a shitload of places.
[989.00s -> 996.31s]  As you can see, the farm is quite in a poor shape.
[996.31s -> 998.31s]  Few repairs have been done here.
[998.31s -> 1000.31s]  What the hell have you been doing?
[1000.31s -> 1002.31s]  I thought you were looking after this place.
[1002.31s -> 1006.31s]  Does that include eating Cheetos on the couch while the place rots?
[1006.31s -> 1011.38s]  But you can have some sleep here or even store some food.
[1011.38s -> 1016.84s]  You will have to bring this farm to a good shape yourself.
[1016.84s -> 1018.84s]  Soon you'll see how to do that.
[1018.84s -> 1027.70s]  This place sucks.
[1027.70s -> 1028.70s]  What did you...
[1028.70s -> 1029.70s]  Like, what did you...
[1029.70s -> 1031.70s]  Has this guy been living here?
[1031.70s -> 1035.54s]  So he inherited this farm.
[1035.54s -> 1036.54s]  Why didn't I get this farm?
[1036.54s -> 1040.90s]  It's empty now, but I'm sure you'll need it pretty soon.
[1040.90s -> 1042.90s]  Well, I'll take a full letter, Greed.
[1042.90s -> 1049.90s]  But if you can afford building materials, then you can fix the construction yourself.
[1049.90s -> 1051.85s]  Okay.
[1052.85s -> 1059.50s]  His farm, your problem.
[1059.50s -> 1061.50s]  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[1061.50s -> 1069.86s]  That's the guy from How It's Made.
[1078.71s -> 1080.71s]  It really is.
[1080.71s -> 1082.71s]  I hope he tells me.
[1089.21s -> 1091.21s]  Imagine if he stands behind you while you work.
[1093.64s -> 1095.64s]  And he, like, just narrates what you're doing.
[1095.64s -> 1099.97s]  The farmer screws the nails into the board.
[1099.97s -> 1101.97s]  Oh, I hope that happens.
[1101.97s -> 1110.54s]  It's like, Oliver, will you fuck off?
[1110.54s -> 1114.54s]  The cowshed is old and needs some work, but it's still solid.
[1114.54s -> 1117.54s]  You can do the fixes and upgrades yourself.
[1117.54s -> 1120.54s]  Try fixing those holes first.
[1120.54s -> 1121.54s]  The cowshed?
[1121.54s -> 1122.54s]  So your animals stay healthy.
[1122.54s -> 1123.54s]  What holes?
[1123.54s -> 1126.54s]  I see you've come prepared and have your own tools.
[1126.54s -> 1127.54s]  Good.
[1127.54s -> 1131.54s]  Try to fix these doors since it's stuck and won't open.
[1132.54s -> 1133.54s]  Okay, hold on.
[1133.54s -> 1137.54s]  This game is like, I need v-sync turned on.
[1137.54s -> 1141.81s]  Because it's like, it's killing me.
[1141.81s -> 1145.65s]  I have to, I think I have to restart the game.
[1145.65s -> 1147.65s]  We'll get to a save point first.
[1147.65s -> 1148.65s]  All right.
[1148.65s -> 1150.65s]  Equip the repair tool from the work mode menu.
[1150.65s -> 1151.65s]  Check the barn for sections.
[1151.65s -> 1153.65s]  Okay, the work mode menu.
[1153.65s -> 1156.78s]  This is an open world game?
[1156.78s -> 1162.26s]  Why do I have a Grand Theft Auto map?
[1162.26s -> 1163.26s]  Are you serious?
[1163.26s -> 1173.40s]  Okay, I need a barn.
[1173.40s -> 1174.40s]  Your animals live here.
[1174.40s -> 1175.40s]  Keep this building in good shape
[1175.40s -> 1178.79s]  so that your animals grow healthy.
[1178.79s -> 1179.79s]  Oh, okay.
[1179.79s -> 1187.09s]  Engineer site.
[1187.09s -> 1188.09s]  Open, activate.
[1188.09s -> 1197.78s]  Repair old planks.
[1197.78s -> 1198.78s]  All right.
[1198.78s -> 1203.32s]  It should open now.
[1203.32s -> 1207.42s]  I already opened it.
[1207.42s -> 1209.42s]  The door, oh, I opened it already.
[1209.42s -> 1210.42s]  Why did I have to do that?
[1210.42s -> 1215.97s]  Wow, look at this.
[1215.97s -> 1217.97s]  Don't tell me what vegetable it is.
[1217.97s -> 1219.34s]  That's wheat.
[1219.34s -> 1220.64s]  Got it.
[1220.64s -> 1224.52s]  Build a scaffold to climb up there and check the roof.
[1224.52s -> 1232.01s]  Build a scaffold to from the work mode menu.
[1232.01s -> 1233.18s]  This?
[1233.18s -> 1235.18s]  Build a scaffolding.
[1235.18s -> 1244.02s]  Holy shit, that took no time at all.
[1244.02s -> 1246.02s]  That was instantaneous.
[1246.02s -> 1248.02s]  I'm carrying this?
[1248.02s -> 1261.25s]  All right, I'm up.
[1261.25s -> 1263.25s]  Is this Fortnite?
[1263.25s -> 1265.25s]  Real life Fortnite.
[1265.25s -> 1267.25s]  Should I just make a shitload of them?
[1267.25s -> 1268.25s]  No, if it was real life Fortnite, guys,
[1268.25s -> 1271.25s]  it would be like this.
[1271.25s -> 1273.25s]  Fuck, what are you saying?
[1273.25s -> 1276.77s]  Fuck me.
[1276.77s -> 1278.77s]  I always got hit by that.
[1278.77s -> 1279.77s]  All right.
[1279.77s -> 1287.10s]  If it was real life Fortnite, it would be this.
[1287.10s -> 1288.10s]  I can only have two out at one time.
[1288.10s -> 1289.10s]  Never mind.
[1289.10s -> 1293.74s]  How do I remove this?
[1293.74s -> 1294.74s]  Whatever, we can have two.
[1294.74s -> 1299.92s]  All right, what do you want me to do?
[1299.92s -> 1301.92s]  You can store harvested grains in the silo.
[1301.92s -> 1302.92s]  Fuck me.
[1302.92s -> 1305.92s]  So use these later or sell them if you want.
[1305.92s -> 1306.92s]  I'm sorry.
[1306.92s -> 1310.92s]  Before you use the silo, remember to fix it first.
[1310.92s -> 1311.92s]  Okay.
[1311.92s -> 1314.93s]  Repair rusty metal.
[1314.93s -> 1328.67s]  Do I need more pieces?
[1328.67s -> 1329.67s]  I think I did it.
[1329.67s -> 1337.94s]  Oh.
[1337.94s -> 1338.94s]  What is going on here?
[1338.94s -> 1339.94s]  Take a look at the greenhouse.
[1339.94s -> 1343.94s]  You can grow some veggies here fast to earn some quick money.
[1343.94s -> 1345.94s]  I shaved the back of his head.
[1345.94s -> 1347.94s]  Still, you'll have to fix these holes
[1347.94s -> 1350.94s]  so your plants can grow to a best effect.
[1350.94s -> 1355.46s]  Okay, fix these holes.
[1355.46s -> 1359.46s]  I see your grandfather bought some materials to fix it already.
[1359.46s -> 1360.46s]  There's a car over there.
[1360.46s -> 1363.46s]  You can use it to rebuild the greenhouse as good as you can.
[1363.46s -> 1364.46s]  Okay.
[1364.46s -> 1365.46s]  Pick up metal?
[1366.46s -> 1368.46s]  Steel sheets to fix it.
[1368.46s -> 1369.46s]  It was already gone.
[1369.46s -> 1371.46s]  Did somebody read that?
[1371.46s -> 1377.26s]  Rebuild rusty metal with metal.
[1377.26s -> 1385.77s]  Where am I going to do the door?
[1385.77s -> 1389.57s]  Okay, I'm done.
[1389.57s -> 1393.41s]  You were pretty good at this.
[1393.41s -> 1396.41s]  I'm sure you'll do well on this farm.
[1396.41s -> 1401.14s]  Actually, I might have a job for you myself.
[1401.14s -> 1403.14s]  What is it?
[1403.14s -> 1406.38s]  Why don't you come to my place and do some fixes to my barn?
[1406.38s -> 1409.38s]  It's mostly roof that needs work,
[1409.38s -> 1412.38s]  but some walls need attention too.
[1412.38s -> 1414.38s]  I don't have much money,
[1414.38s -> 1417.38s]  but I'll give you my old tractor as a reward.
[1417.38s -> 1420.56s]  I'm sure you can use it.
[1420.56s -> 1421.56s]  Stop.
[1421.56s -> 1423.56s]  Wait, this dialogue options?
[1423.56s -> 1424.56s]  All right, sounds good.
[1424.56s -> 1425.56s]  I'll take care of that.
[1425.56s -> 1426.56s]  Thanks.
[1426.56s -> 1427.56s]  Should I go to his place?
[1427.56s -> 1428.56s]  Yeah.
[1428.56s -> 1429.56s]  Sounds good.
[1429.56s -> 1430.56s]  I'll take care of this.
[1430.56s -> 1432.56s]  I love this game already.
[1432.56s -> 1433.56s]  All right.
[1433.56s -> 1435.80s]  I'm going back home now.
[1435.80s -> 1437.80s]  Good luck and see you around.
[1437.80s -> 1445.54s]  What the fuck do I do now?
[1445.54s -> 1449.90s]  You received a thousand social points.
[1449.90s -> 1450.90s]  All right.
[1450.90s -> 1452.90s]  I'm kind of lost.
[1452.90s -> 1460.45s]  I've got a really important job for you.
[1460.45s -> 1462.45s]  Why don't you come to my place?
[1462.45s -> 1466.58s]  The way that I'm like dressed too.
[1466.58s -> 1476.84s]  I'm dressed in like a Halloween costume repairman costume.
[1476.84s -> 1482.46s]  What's in here?
[1482.46s -> 1483.46s]  This is my house, right?
[1483.46s -> 1490.69s]  What the fuck is all this stuff?
[1490.69s -> 1497.60s]  Enter the pantry.
[1497.60s -> 1504.51s]  Oh, Italian tomato soup cooked or condensed food tasty.
[1504.51s -> 1506.51s]  And do I have to eat?
[1506.51s -> 1516.94s]  This isn't even doing anything.
[1516.94s -> 1519.91s]  Holy shit.
[1519.91s -> 1520.91s]  Imagine playing the game.
[1520.91s -> 1522.91s]  What is this FOV slider?
[1522.91s -> 1526.05s]  Let's go right in the middle where it starts.
[1526.05s -> 1530.72s]  Oh my God.
[1530.72s -> 1531.72s]  What?
[1531.72s -> 1541.02s]  What?
[1541.02s -> 1542.02s]  What?
[1542.02s -> 1543.02s]  What?
[1543.02s -> 1544.02s]  What?
[1544.02s -> 1547.12s]  What's going on?
[1547.12s -> 1557.19s]  He doesn't know.
[1557.19s -> 1558.19s]  He didn't know.
[1558.19s -> 1559.19s]  What's wrong?
[1559.19s -> 1560.19s]  Why even have an FOV option that goes down this far?
[1560.19s -> 1562.65s]  Who plays a game like this?
[1562.65s -> 1565.65s]  Why wouldn't you have the option to go up rather than down this far?
[1565.65s -> 1569.45s]  All right.
[1569.45s -> 1572.45s]  Well, at max FOV, this is definitely like 60.
[1572.45s -> 1574.14s]  Is this 90?
[1574.14s -> 1575.14s]  I don't think it is.
[1575.14s -> 1576.14s]  Whatever.
[1576.14s -> 1577.14s]  All right.
[1577.14s -> 1579.66s]  What's wrong?
[1579.66s -> 1580.66s]  All right.
[1580.66s -> 1581.66s]  I got to go to the guy's house.
[1581.66s -> 1583.34s]  Right?
[1583.34s -> 1584.34s]  Home sweet home.
[1584.34s -> 1585.34s]  Complete repairs on your farm.
[1585.34s -> 1586.34s]  Help Oliver.
[1586.34s -> 1588.34s]  Go to Oliver's farm and fix his barn.
[1588.34s -> 1591.34s]  Use engineer's site to see which sections of the barn need repairs.
[1591.34s -> 1592.34s]  Let's go there.
[1592.34s -> 1612.70s]  Is that my truck?
[1612.70s -> 1613.70s]  Police?
[1628.43s -> 1630.43s]  That's not what I was trying to do.
[1630.43s -> 1631.43s]  Oh, I see.
[1631.43s -> 1632.43s]  What's your trade?
[1632.43s -> 1635.43s]  A bit of everything.
[1635.43s -> 1636.43s]  Nails.
[1636.43s -> 1637.43s]  Soap.
[1637.43s -> 1638.43s]  Some food.
[1638.43s -> 1642.67s]  You know, I will also buy fresh food from you if you can spare.
[1642.67s -> 1644.67s]  Nothing big, but I could use some fish.
[1644.67s -> 1645.67s]  What about hamburgers?
[1645.67s -> 1646.67s]  Mushrooms, perhaps.
[1646.67s -> 1647.67s]  You know.
[1647.67s -> 1650.67s]  Well, that's really good to know.
[1650.67s -> 1652.67s]  I'll see you around.
[1652.67s -> 1653.85s]  All right.
[1653.85s -> 1654.85s]  Not going anywhere.
[1654.85s -> 1655.85s]  You know.
[1655.85s -> 1659.39s]  Where am I?
[1659.39s -> 1661.66s]  Oh, OK.
[1661.66s -> 1664.47s]  You notice a stranger by the road.
[1664.47s -> 1666.47s]  He clearly wants something.
[1666.47s -> 1667.47s]  Wait, what?
[1667.47s -> 1677.71s]  Wait, I want to sell you stuff.
[1677.71s -> 1678.71s]  Come here.
[1678.71s -> 1680.78s]  Good to see you.
[1680.78s -> 1681.78s]  Can I help you?
[1681.78s -> 1685.18s]  Uh, care to trade.
[1685.18s -> 1687.18s]  Care to trade?
[1687.18s -> 1688.48s]  Sure.
[1688.48s -> 1689.48s]  What do you need?
[1689.48s -> 1691.48s]  Here, I've got a hamburger.
[1691.48s -> 1694.48s]  Delicious food of great nutritional value.
[1694.48s -> 1696.48s]  Twenty-six dollars.
[1696.48s -> 1697.48s]  Canned food.
[1697.48s -> 1698.48s]  Oh, here.
[1698.48s -> 1705.53s]  Take that.
[1705.53s -> 1707.90s]  Here, take all these soups.
[1707.90s -> 1708.90s]  How much money do I got?
[1708.90s -> 1710.20s]  Five hundred and fifty dollars.
[1710.20s -> 1711.20s]  All right.
[1711.20s -> 1713.20s]  Here, take this spicy pumpkin soup.
[1713.20s -> 1718.68s]  Uh, I'm keeping the apple and the tomatoes.
[1718.68s -> 1719.68s]  You can have everything else.
[1719.68s -> 1725.53s]  Hold on.
[1725.53s -> 1728.53s]  Why are there drones?
[1728.53s -> 1731.60s]  A wedding ring?
[1731.60s -> 1736.42s]  Wait.
[1736.42s -> 1738.11s]  Perfect.
[1738.11s -> 1739.11s]  Expensive item.
[1739.11s -> 1740.11s]  Perfect gift.
[1740.11s -> 1741.11s]  Is there a chainsaw?
[1741.11s -> 1754.36s]  How do I equip the chainsaw?
[1754.36s -> 1762.96s]  OK.
[1762.96s -> 1763.96s]  Put it away.
[1763.96s -> 1764.96s]  Put it away.
[1764.96s -> 1765.96s]  Put it away.
[1765.96s -> 1768.10s]  Let's go.
[1768.10s -> 1769.10s]  I need to do my quest.
[1771.04s -> 1773.04s]  I haven't even started playing the game yet.
[1773.04s -> 1777.46s]  I have to play the game.
[1777.46s -> 1778.46s]  What is that?
[1778.46s -> 1779.46s]  Is that an animal?
[1779.46s -> 1790.04s]  Buy a ring from him and then propose to him.
[1790.04s -> 1793.01s]  Can you pet?
[1793.01s -> 1794.01s]  Can I feed the dog?
[1794.01s -> 1802.67s]  I don't think so.
[1802.67s -> 1803.67s]  All right.
[1803.67s -> 1810.98s]  Let's go.
[1810.98s -> 1817.07s]  Get in the fucking truck and just drive the damn thing for Christ's sake.
[1817.07s -> 1822.66s]  OK.
[1822.66s -> 1824.66s]  Where is Oliver's house?
[1824.66s -> 1831.50s]  Can I put a waypoint?
[1831.50s -> 1833.50s]  Go to Oliver's farm and fix his barn.
[1833.50s -> 1835.06s]  All right.
[1835.06s -> 1836.06s]  I have a waypoint there.
[1836.06s -> 1837.30s]  I think.
[1837.30s -> 1850.44s]  There we go.
[1850.44s -> 1851.44s]  Somebody else's farm.
[1851.44s -> 1853.44s]  I'm just driving over all this stuff.
[1853.44s -> 1858.62s]  God damn it.
[1858.62s -> 1859.62s]  Change camera.
[1859.62s -> 1861.06s]  Can I go?
[1861.06s -> 1866.75s]  Oh, I can go inside.
[1866.75s -> 1867.75s]  Destroy the competition.
[1867.75s -> 1868.75s]  Yeah.
[1868.75s -> 1872.38s]  There can only be one farmer in this town.
[1872.38s -> 1873.38s]  You're destroying strangers' crops.
[1873.38s -> 1875.38s]  It's bad for your social status.
[1875.38s -> 1876.38s]  Oh, are you?
[1876.38s -> 1884.30s]  Is this Oliver's house?
[1884.30s -> 1885.30s]  Wait.
[1885.30s -> 1886.30s]  This is Oliver's barn.
[1886.30s -> 1887.30s]  Fuck Oliver.
[1887.30s -> 1896.77s]  You let my grandfather's place go to shit.
[1896.77s -> 1897.77s]  You think I care?
[1897.77s -> 1900.99s]  All right.
[1900.99s -> 1901.99s]  What do I need to fix?
[1901.99s -> 1908.66s]  I'm coming over here with like a huge tractor and I'm going to just dig up all of his stuff
[1908.66s -> 1912.27s]  and steal it.
[1912.27s -> 1917.84s]  Have I already gone full blown psycho?
[1917.84s -> 1918.84s]  Where's his barn?
[1918.84s -> 1934.82s]  Oliver, where the fuck are you?
[1934.82s -> 1951.59s]  Is this where he lives?
[1951.59s -> 1956.75s]  Just like the sicko cutting his shit down.
[1956.75s -> 1957.75s]  Just block the road.
[1957.75s -> 1958.75s]  Well, he'll figure it out.
[1958.75s -> 1959.75s]  All right.
[1959.75s -> 1960.75s]  Where is Oliver?
[1960.75s -> 1963.95s]  You notice a lady by her farm.
[1963.95s -> 1968.43s]  Perhaps it would be nice to say hello.
[1968.43s -> 1969.43s]  This lady?
[1969.43s -> 1973.08s]  I don't understand what this game wants me to do.
[1973.08s -> 1974.08s]  I'm trying to find...
[1974.08s -> 1976.08s]  So good to see you, sweetheart.
[1976.08s -> 1977.08s]  Can you help me?
[1977.08s -> 1979.45s]  What can I do for you, ma'am?
[1979.45s -> 1981.94s]  My brother is working abroad.
[1981.94s -> 1985.94s]  He should have been back home a week ago, but he's still busy working.
[1985.94s -> 1989.50s]  I need one of my fields plowed and cultivated.
[1989.50s -> 1991.50s]  Will you do it for me, please?
[1991.50s -> 1994.50s]  Use that old plow over there by the barn.
[1994.50s -> 1995.50s]  You can keep it when you're done.
[1995.50s -> 1996.50s]  All right.
[1996.50s -> 1997.50s]  I'll do it.
[1997.50s -> 1998.50s]  My brother plans on buying a new one anyway.
[1998.50s -> 1999.50s]  I can keep this.
[1999.50s -> 2000.50s]  Okay.
[2000.50s -> 2001.50s]  I'm going to keep this.
[2001.50s -> 2004.79s]  I get a new thing.
[2004.79s -> 2006.10s]  No promises, but I'll see what I can do.
[2006.10s -> 2007.10s]  All right.
[2007.10s -> 2008.10s]  The quest is being fought.
[2008.10s -> 2013.32s]  I need to work on Clara's field.
[2013.32s -> 2016.32s]  It's here, but...
[2016.32s -> 2017.32s]  Okay.
[2017.32s -> 2018.32s]  Let's mark it.
[2018.32s -> 2019.32s]  It's already being marked.
[2019.32s -> 2032.04s]  Do I need my truck for this?
[2032.04s -> 2034.04s]  I think I need to back my truck into that.
[2034.04s -> 2040.46s]  Yeah.
[2040.46s -> 2041.46s]  I got to back up my truck into that.
[2041.46s -> 2058.96s]  I got to get my truck.
[2058.96s -> 2060.96s]  These wheels are off the ground.
[2060.96s -> 2075.98s]  Sorry about that.
[2075.98s -> 2076.98s]  Okay.
[2076.98s -> 2078.98s]  Back the truck up into this.
[2078.98s -> 2081.38s]  Somehow.
[2081.38s -> 2089.02s]  Other way?
[2089.02s -> 2112.87s]  You can't do this with a truck?
[2112.87s -> 2121.34s]  Attach.
[2121.34s -> 2122.34s]  Didn't I try to go in here?
[2122.34s -> 2126.21s]  Oh, shit.
[2126.21s -> 2129.02s]  There's no tractor in here, you guys.
[2129.02s -> 2130.02s]  There's nothing in here.
[2130.02s -> 2142.23s]  Where's your tractor?
[2142.23s -> 2147.74s]  In my barn?
[2147.74s -> 2150.74s]  You fix this and then they give you a tractor.
[2150.74s -> 2152.74s]  Wait, I have to just plug the holes?
[2152.74s -> 2167.22s]  All right.
[2167.22s -> 2175.44s]  I did it.
[2175.44s -> 2177.44s]  I can use my farm revision.
[2177.44s -> 2181.60s]  Farming is really easy.
[2181.60s -> 2190.69s]  Attach the old plow to work.
[2190.69s -> 2191.69s]  The quest is being fought.
[2191.69s -> 2193.69s]  Attach the old plow to work.
[2193.69s -> 2198.23s]  Complete repairs.
[2198.23s -> 2204.29s]  Am I just dumb or do I not have a tractor?
[2204.29s -> 2205.29s]  Do I have to get a tractor?
[2205.29s -> 2209.36s]  Do I have to fix up the rest of this barn?
[2209.36s -> 2214.89s]  Yes.
[2214.89s -> 2215.89s]  But you do need a tractor.
[2215.89s -> 2216.89s]  Okay.
[2216.89s -> 2218.89s]  So you get it from...
[2218.89s -> 2219.89s]  All right.
[2219.89s -> 2223.09s]  We're going to come back here later.
[2223.09s -> 2224.09s]  Oliver first.
[2224.09s -> 2226.09s]  I need to repair my own place first.
[2226.09s -> 2227.39s]  Is there a horn?
[2227.39s -> 2232.58s]  If there's not a horn, it's the worst game.
[2232.58s -> 2233.58s]  See you later.
[2233.58s -> 2240.06s]  Oh, you both don't like me.
[2240.06s -> 2241.06s]  Bye.
[2241.06s -> 2246.98s]  All right.
[2246.98s -> 2247.98s]  So I need to go...
[2249.34s -> 2253.34s]  I need to like save the game first and then like restart with VSync on.
[2253.34s -> 2254.90s]  Yeah.
[2254.90s -> 2256.66s]  Okay.
[2256.66s -> 2257.66s]  There we go.
[2257.66s -> 2259.92s]  Saving the game.
[2259.92s -> 2262.89s]  Am I good?
[2262.89s -> 2263.89s]  All right.
[2263.89s -> 2264.89s]  Yeah.
[2264.89s -> 2265.89s]  Let me just...
[2265.89s -> 2266.89s]  VSync has to be turned on.
[2266.89s -> 2268.38s]  This is like killing me.
[2268.38s -> 2269.38s]  My credit sucks.
[2269.38s -> 2270.38s]  It'll improve very shortly.
[2270.38s -> 2272.33s]  No, it's not on.
[2272.33s -> 2275.95s]  I have to restart the game.
[2275.95s -> 2278.64s]  I have to restart the game.
[2278.64s -> 2279.64s]  It'll be turned on.
[2279.64s -> 2280.64s]  Here we go.
[2280.64s -> 2281.64s]  One, two, three.
[2281.64s -> 2283.58s]  You want to leave?
[2283.58s -> 2284.58s]  Yes.
[2284.58s -> 2290.58s]  Is this like actually an iPad game ad where I accidentally click on yes and take me to
[2290.58s -> 2291.58s]  this person's Discord?
[2291.58s -> 2299.29s]  That's kind of...
[2299.29s -> 2300.29s]  All right.
[2300.29s -> 2301.29s]  Whatever.
[2301.29s -> 2302.29s]  All right.
[2302.29s -> 2304.29s]  Let's reopen it and then we can go.
[2304.29s -> 2308.29s]  I have to turn on VSync, otherwise the game's going to keep hurting my eyes.
[2308.29s -> 2314.90s]  All right.
[2314.90s -> 2318.45s]  Load game.
[2318.45s -> 2322.03s]  Wait, what's going on here?
[2322.03s -> 2324.91s]  Why is this so tiny?
[2324.91s -> 2326.91s]  VSync on 1920 by 1080.
[2326.91s -> 2327.91s]  What the fuck is this?
[2327.91s -> 2330.09s]  Why is this in such a tiny window?
[2330.09s -> 2336.87s]  What is going on here?
[2336.87s -> 2342.10s]  Why does it look normal for you but look awful for me?
[2342.10s -> 2358.71s]  I mean, I'd definitely play it, but why is it in such a tiny...
[2358.71s -> 2360.71s]  It's in a small window.
[2360.71s -> 2364.19s]  VSync...
[2364.19s -> 2366.19s]  What do you mean VSync off?
[2366.19s -> 2367.75s]  No.
[2367.75s -> 2371.25s]  VSync on 1920 by 1080.
[2371.25s -> 2372.25s]  What are you doing?
[2372.25s -> 2376.02s]  Windowed off, 1920 by 1080.
[2376.02s -> 2377.02s]  Let's go.
[2377.02s -> 2379.10s]  Come on.
[2379.10s -> 2380.10s]  It's in like a 1200 by...
[2380.10s -> 2383.10s]  It's like a 720 window on my desktop.
[2383.10s -> 2392.06s]  What the fuck is this?
[2392.06s -> 2395.60s]  Okay.
[2395.60s -> 2396.60s]  Is it doing this shit again?
[2396.60s -> 2398.97s]  Why is it in a window?
[2398.97s -> 2403.96s]  I have no idea what's going on.
[2403.96s -> 2405.84s]  Save the settings.
[2405.84s -> 2408.84s]  What do you mean save the settings?
[2408.84s -> 2412.51s]  Alt-Enter.
[2412.51s -> 2415.29s]  All right, we're good.
[2415.29s -> 2416.85s]  All right, let's go.
[2416.85s -> 2418.85s]  No family, pretty good condition.
[2418.85s -> 2419.85s]  I'm ready to go.
[2419.85s -> 2420.85s]  That was fucked up.
[2420.85s -> 2424.74s]  There's no save settings.
[2424.74s -> 2427.74s]  Guys, there's no save settings.
[2427.74s -> 2431.74s]  You have to restart the game to have your settings take place.
[2431.74s -> 2440.28s]  Did that help?
[2440.28s -> 2442.16s]  Yeah, it did.
[2442.16s -> 2446.42s]  All right, let's go back to...
[2446.42s -> 2447.42s]  Where are we going?
[2447.42s -> 2452.07s]  We're trying to go to Oliver.
[2452.07s -> 2454.31s]  Fix Oliver's barn.
[2454.31s -> 2460.90s]  All right, that's how you mark it.
[2460.90s -> 2461.90s]  I get it.
[2461.90s -> 2462.90s]  Let's go.
[2462.90s -> 2479.18s]  Am I running out of gas?
[2479.18s -> 2481.18s]  Why am I going so slow?
[2481.18s -> 2484.96s]  Why am I going so slow?
[2484.96s -> 2493.02s]  That's a huge bird.
[2493.02s -> 2495.39s]  That bird was like 10 feet tall.
[2495.39s -> 2500.13s]  All right, Oliver, what do you need?
[2500.13s -> 2508.94s]  I'm here to fix your barn.
[2508.94s -> 2509.94s]  Yuck.
[2509.94s -> 2512.25s]  Did use a lot of work, Oliver.
[2512.25s -> 2517.30s]  All right, Oliver, I'm here.
[2517.30s -> 2521.57s]  I don't know what's going on this way, but can I pick that up?
[2521.57s -> 2523.90s]  All right, we've got it.
[2523.90s -> 2525.90s]  Oof, broken.
[2525.90s -> 2526.90s]  I'll fix it.
[2526.90s -> 2533.51s]  That's that.
[2533.51s -> 2534.51s]  Up there, too.
[2534.51s -> 2535.51s]  Can I reach?
[2535.51s -> 2539.03s]  Of course I can.
[2539.03s -> 2548.97s]  What's that Minecraft hack that just builds in like 10, 15 blocks ahead of you?
[2548.97s -> 2551.04s]  How do I...
[2551.04s -> 2553.04s]  I've got to get on the roof and fix this roof.
[2553.04s -> 2558.76s]  Oh, Oliver.
[2558.76s -> 2562.22s]  All right, we've got to get on the roof.
[2562.22s -> 2563.22s]  Scaffolding time.
[2563.22s -> 2576.98s]  Okay, let's repair this.
[2576.98s -> 2585.42s]  Dude, pog, let's go.
[2585.42s -> 2598.46s]  Do I get social credit with this?
[2598.46s -> 2599.46s]  I wonder what that means.
[2599.46s -> 2603.74s]  Steel tractor.
[2603.74s -> 2606.50s]  I'm probably going to get one for this.
[2606.50s -> 2611.62s]  This is going to take a long fucking time.
[2611.62s -> 2632.88s]  Imagine redoing somebody's entire barn, building it back, repairing everything for 50 likes on an Instagram post.
[2632.88s -> 2637.17s]  I'm not so sure that's worth it.
[2637.17s -> 2648.54s]  Okay, well, that's almost the other side.
[2649.54s -> 2657.92s]  Actually, it kind of feels nice to do this.
[2657.92s -> 2661.70s]  Is there a third-person mode?
[2661.70s -> 2665.15s]  No, of course there isn't.
[2684.63s -> 2686.63s]  I'm not even doing my own house.
[2686.63s -> 2693.65s]  I drank coffee so I wouldn't fall asleep today.
[2693.65s -> 2697.65s]  Well, you've got two factors fighting back and forth.
[2697.65s -> 2705.11s]  You've got farming dynasty stream and a bunch of coffee.
[2705.11s -> 2707.11s]  You're being pulled in two different directions.
[2707.11s -> 2711.87s]  I did it.
[2711.87s -> 2714.37s]  Barn fix, talk to Oliver and ask for your reward.
[2714.37s -> 2716.37s]  Is it fall damage?
[2716.37s -> 2721.17s]  Ooh, I'm going to get that.
[2721.17s -> 2722.17s]  That's mine.
[2722.17s -> 2729.91s]  Oliver, I fixed the barn.
[2729.91s -> 2732.60s]  Looking good and solid.
[2732.60s -> 2733.60s]  Thank you.
[2733.60s -> 2740.29s]  Now, I don't have much money, but as promised, that John Deere over there is all yours.
[2740.29s -> 2744.29s]  It should do well until you can afford a real neutral.
[2744.29s -> 2746.29s]  You said the copyrighted name.
[2746.29s -> 2748.29s]  I can totally start fieldwork now.
[2748.29s -> 2750.29s]  You were supposed to not say the copyright name.
[2750.29s -> 2754.29s]  The copyright names are kind of short, but I think I'll need more farming machines.
[2754.29s -> 2756.29s]  You should talk to people.
[2756.29s -> 2759.29s]  I'm sure a lot of them will have some work for you too.
[2759.29s -> 2765.85s]  You'll need a plow, a cedar perhaps, and I've seen a cultivator already on your farm.
[2765.85s -> 2767.85s]  Good luck with farming.
[2767.85s -> 2769.85s]  I will look around.
[2769.85s -> 2770.85s]  Thank you.
[2770.85s -> 2776.16s]  I just stole an apple.
[2776.16s -> 2782.17s]  Okay, so drive your new Jack Bear tractor.
[2782.17s -> 2784.41s]  Cool.
[2784.41s -> 2787.99s]  Have you finished your task?
[2787.99s -> 2789.23s]  I did.
[2789.23s -> 2790.23s]  All right, thanks for the tractor.
[2790.23s -> 2810.57s]  Where are you going?
[2810.57s -> 2815.47s]  Who is this person, and why are they sprinting?
[2815.47s -> 2835.06s]  Not now, sorry.
[2835.06s -> 2836.06s]  I'm curious.
[2836.06s -> 2844.91s]  I need to know what you're doing.
[2844.91s -> 2848.14s]  What?
[2848.14s -> 2852.83s]  Where'd he go?
[2852.83s -> 2855.26s]  Wait, did he go into the corn?
[2855.26s -> 2862.62s]  Oh, shit, he went into the corn.
[2862.62s -> 2863.62s]  Uh-oh.
[2863.62s -> 2866.25s]  Wait, I probably shouldn't have done this.
[2866.25s -> 2867.25s]  There we go.
[2867.25s -> 2872.52s]  Thank God I have a map.
[2872.52s -> 2875.94s]  Well, that was weird.
[2875.94s -> 2881.70s]  All right, give me my tractor.
[2881.70s -> 2883.70s]  I can purchase your field.
[2883.70s -> 2886.70s]  So I'm just going to end up as a monopoly farm and own everything?
[2886.70s -> 2904.30s]  Okay.
[2904.30s -> 2907.30s]  You received Jack Bear C and 100 social points.
[2907.30s -> 2909.95s]  Cool.
[2909.95s -> 2911.95s]  All right, now I can do Clara's job.
[2911.95s -> 2913.95s]  That's the one we're going to do now.
[2913.95s -> 2919.52s]  Okay, I don't really want to drive this.
[2919.52s -> 2924.53s]  This is like driving around a giant unicycle or a giant tricycle.
[2924.53s -> 2930.99s]  I don't want to lose social points.
[2930.99s -> 2936.07s]  It has four wheels.
[2936.07s -> 2937.07s]  That don't matter.
[2937.07s -> 2939.07s]  The two in the front maze will be one.
[2939.07s -> 2946.20s]  99.
[2946.20s -> 2947.20s]  I have to get gas too.
[2947.20s -> 2963.33s]  Look at how big this bird is.
[2963.33s -> 2965.33s]  Birds aren't that big.
[2965.33s -> 2969.33s]  That would think it was like a fucking bald eagle.
[2969.33s -> 2976.33s]  All right.
[2976.33s -> 2978.70s]  How do I, let me, I got to attach this.
[2978.70s -> 3001.12s]  How does it attach?
[3001.12s -> 3005.86s]  I've never, I don't know what this thing is.
[3005.86s -> 3026.66s]  He's a fucking city slicker.
[3026.66s -> 3030.41s]  I don't know what the, I don't know how to do this.
[3030.41s -> 3032.41s]  I don't know how, what this thing is.
[3032.41s -> 3035.41s]  I know it's like a plow and his blades on it and shit,
[3035.41s -> 3036.41s]  but I don't know how that would do.
[3036.41s -> 3038.41s]  Why can I not attach this?
[3038.41s -> 3040.41s]  Did I have it before?
[3040.41s -> 3046.90s]  Oh, okay.
[3046.90s -> 3048.14s]  Got it.
[3048.14s -> 3051.14s]  Plow Clara's field.
[3051.14s -> 3054.30s]  This one here.
[3054.30s -> 3059.23s]  How do I use the plow?
[3059.23s -> 3063.80s]  Yeah.
[3063.80s -> 3064.80s]  You got nothing here, Clara.
[3064.80s -> 3068.80s]  When you plow your field, drive over your sand.
[3068.80s -> 3070.17s]  What is here?
[3070.17s -> 3084.26s]  Am I doing this right?
[3084.26s -> 3087.26s]  Oh, wait, wait, lower the machine, lower the machine.
[3087.26s -> 3089.02s]  Oh man.
[3089.02s -> 3090.02s]  Okay.
[3090.02s -> 3096.95s]  Lift the machine.
[3096.95s -> 3098.95s]  Wait, I got to do this whole thing.
[3098.95s -> 3103.97s]  Oh boy.
[3103.97s -> 3108.97s]  Oh shit, I'm tearing up the whole world.
[3108.97s -> 3110.27s]  All right.
[3110.27s -> 3111.27s]  Let's do this quick.
[3111.27s -> 3128.38s]  What do you mean?
[3128.38s -> 3129.38s]  There is no quick?
[3129.38s -> 3140.61s]  All right.
[3140.61s -> 3141.61s]  I almost did one pass.
[3141.61s -> 3150.08s]  All right.
[3150.08s -> 3158.98s]  Now he's going to, I'm going to just like mow in a lawn.
[3158.98s -> 3159.98s]  Holy shit.
[3159.98s -> 3163.22s]  This is going to take like two hours.
[3163.22s -> 3170.36s]  This is going to take so long.
[3170.36s -> 3173.36s]  This is going to take like an hour.
[3173.36s -> 3174.36s]  This is absolutely nothing.
[3174.36s -> 3175.36s]  This is how I mow lawns.
[3176.36s -> 3178.24s]  I don't know.
[3178.24s -> 3183.24s]  Everybody thinks I'm fucking crazy, but my father used to tell me, son, I want you to
[3183.24s -> 3184.24s]  get out there and I want you to mow the lawn.
[3184.24s -> 3186.24s]  I'd be like, all right, fine.
[3186.24s -> 3187.93s]  And I would just do it like this.
[3187.93s -> 3189.93s]  So I would never have to stop moving.
[3189.93s -> 3191.93s]  You don't have to stop reverse, go back, stop.
[3191.93s -> 3196.74s]  No, I would just go in a circle in a spiral until I got to the very end.
[3196.74s -> 3208.48s]  Wait, slow down.
[3208.48s -> 3209.48s]  Am I going too fast?
[3209.48s -> 3218.06s]  I am going too fast.
[3218.06s -> 3219.55s]  Fuck.
[3219.55s -> 3220.55s]  Hold on.
[3220.55s -> 3225.98s]  Don't go slower.
[3225.98s -> 3226.98s]  There we go.
[3226.98s -> 3235.19s]  Okay.
[3235.19s -> 3236.19s]  What about what?
[3236.19s -> 3237.19s]  It's cruise control.
[3237.19s -> 3239.19s]  Oh, it just drives it for you.
[3239.19s -> 3240.19s]  Good.
[3240.19s -> 3241.19s]  I'll do that.
[3241.19s -> 3242.19s]  I want to change the camera too.
[3242.19s -> 3247.70s]  Let's like relax.
[3247.70s -> 3248.70s]  That's way better.
[3248.70s -> 3250.83s]  All right.
[3250.83s -> 3252.83s]  Now I can actually see what the fuck I'm doing.
[3252.83s -> 3266.58s]  Right now, they're all in the house preparing dinner, looking out the window at this.
[3266.58s -> 3270.58s]  And they're just like, no, no, just let him do it.
[3270.58s -> 3271.58s]  Let him do it that way.
[3271.58s -> 3274.58s]  I mean, don't go out there and like correct him.
[3274.58s -> 3276.94s]  He's kind of a weirdo.
[3276.94s -> 3282.38s]  Just let him do his thing.
[3282.38s -> 3292.85s]  What's going on over there every time?
[3292.85s -> 3293.85s]  Why can I not do that turn?
[3293.85s -> 3306.62s]  What's wrong with me?
[3306.62s -> 3307.62s]  I got plenty of gas.
[3307.62s -> 3309.62s]  I have 95%.
[3309.62s -> 3318.33s]  What's the issue here?
[3318.33s -> 3319.33s]  What do I keep doing?
[3319.33s -> 3332.98s]  Shit.
[3332.98s -> 3333.98s]  All right.
[3333.98s -> 3334.98s]  I'll get it.
[3334.98s -> 3335.98s]  I'm just going backwards.
[3335.98s -> 3336.98s]  Can you go backwards in a plot like this?
[3336.98s -> 3337.98s]  No.
[3337.98s -> 3348.76s]  Yeah.
[3348.76s -> 3352.76s]  But this is, this really is a scenario where somebody would just burst out their fucking
[3352.76s -> 3356.76s]  back door and be like, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, stop, stop, stop it.
[3356.76s -> 3357.94s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[3357.94s -> 3358.94s]  And it's like, what?
[3358.94s -> 3359.94s]  What?
[3359.94s -> 3360.94s]  What?
[3360.94s -> 3361.94s]  Stop.
[3361.94s -> 3367.02s]  Get off.
[3367.02s -> 3368.02s]  Get off the fucking tractor.
[3368.02s -> 3369.02s]  Get off.
[3369.02s -> 3370.02s]  I'd be like, what's going on?
[3370.02s -> 3371.02s]  What's the matter?
[3371.02s -> 3372.64s]  What's the matter?
[3372.64s -> 3373.64s]  I'd be really kind of nervous and like kind of sad.
[3373.64s -> 3377.44s]  Like what?
[3377.44s -> 3378.44s]  What's what's what's happening?
[3378.44s -> 3379.44s]  Get off.
[3379.44s -> 3380.44s]  Just go home.
[3380.44s -> 3381.44s]  Thank you.
[3381.44s -> 3382.44s]  Thank you.
[3382.44s -> 3383.44s]  I appreciate the help.
[3383.44s -> 3386.54s]  Thank you.
[3386.54s -> 3389.25s]  Thank you so much.
[3389.25s -> 3390.25s]  Thank you.
[3390.25s -> 3391.25s]  But just get off.
[3391.25s -> 3405.16s]  I can't do it.
[3405.16s -> 3406.16s]  Yes, I can.
[3407.16s -> 3423.82s]  Back left wheel.
[3423.82s -> 3424.82s]  All right.
[3424.82s -> 3425.82s]  I'm going to just, here we go.
[3425.82s -> 3427.06s]  I have a new plan.
[3427.06s -> 3430.06s]  I can't use my old lawn mowing technique.
[3430.06s -> 3440.83s]  Does it matter if you just like go over, you are getting hungry.
[3440.83s -> 3443.74s]  Okay.
[3443.74s -> 3454.54s]  I have to eat.
[3454.54s -> 3455.54s]  Just go over there and eat.
[3455.54s -> 3456.54s]  Can I just like walk over there?
[3456.54s -> 3457.84s]  Does it?
[3457.84s -> 3458.84s]  All right.
[3458.84s -> 3463.22s]  I'm hungry.
[3463.22s -> 3464.22s]  Lunch break.
[3464.22s -> 3465.52s]  Lunch break.
[3465.52s -> 3478.79s]  Exit.
[3478.79s -> 3479.79s]  Do I have any food?
[3479.79s -> 3480.79s]  Oh, an apple.
[3480.79s -> 3481.79s]  Here we go.
[3481.79s -> 3482.79s]  Your condition.
[3482.79s -> 3483.79s]  Food.
[3483.79s -> 3484.79s]  Your condition depends on both eating and sleeping.
[3484.79s -> 3486.79s]  I don't know how to feel and work better.
[3486.79s -> 3490.86s]  Food, 44, sleep, 63.
[3490.86s -> 3492.86s]  What do you mean sleep?
[3492.86s -> 3500.70s]  All right.
[3500.70s -> 3501.70s]  Unhitched it.
[3501.70s -> 3512.86s]  Oops.
[3512.86s -> 3515.54s]  They're looking out the window again.
[3515.54s -> 3516.54s]  Yeah.
[3516.54s -> 3517.54s]  He unhitched it.
[3517.54s -> 3518.54s]  I just, I mean, that thing was expensive.
[3518.54s -> 3519.54s]  I just don't want him to break it.
[3519.54s -> 3521.04s]  I'm going to go out there.
[3521.04s -> 3524.04s]  I know I shouldn't go out there, but I'm going to go out there.
[3524.04s -> 3525.04s]  I think he, oh, he got it.
[3525.04s -> 3526.04s]  He got it.
[3526.04s -> 3527.04s]  Okay.
[3527.04s -> 3528.04s]  I just don't want him to break it.
[3528.04s -> 3537.66s]  Honey, I don't want him to break it.
[3537.66s -> 3538.66s]  Right.
[3538.66s -> 3546.19s]  There's an argument going on in that, in like the living room over here.
[3546.19s -> 3547.19s]  It's all my fault.
[3547.19s -> 3551.16s]  Let me get this little section.
[3551.16s -> 3564.92s]  Why is it so hard for me to do this?
[3564.92s -> 3568.35s]  Because this thing turns.
[3568.35s -> 3570.35s]  This thing, it's hard to control.
[3570.35s -> 3588.55s]  It's not, it's, it's hard.
[3588.55s -> 3590.55s]  It's like, it's hard to turn on a dime.
[3590.55s -> 3592.55s]  Look, it takes me a full, whatever.
[3592.55s -> 3594.55s]  I don't care.
[3594.55s -> 3617.81s]  Wait, press R so I can turn better.
[3617.81s -> 3630.39s]  Dragon the whole time.
[3630.39s -> 3631.39s]  All right.
[3631.39s -> 3638.88s]  They're not going to be able to grow shit in this.
[3638.88s -> 3639.88s]  Look at this.
[3639.88s -> 3644.10s]  Look at how bad that looks.
[3644.10s -> 3652.53s]  Oh, this does not look good.
[3652.53s -> 3660.82s]  This is a coloring book that you gave a four year old.
[3660.82s -> 3665.82s]  At least I'm staying inside the lines, but inside the lines is a joke.
[3665.82s -> 3669.00s]  Strokes go in two or three different ways.
[3669.00s -> 3678.62s]  I'm almost done.
[3678.62s -> 3685.09s]  Look at how bumpy it is.
[3685.09s -> 3690.82s]  It's so bumpy over there.
[3690.82s -> 3696.11s]  It's not smooth at all.
[3696.11s -> 3698.11s]  I've made dunes.
[3698.11s -> 3702.72s]  Oh, this is very, very bad.
[3702.72s -> 3704.72s]  Do I get in trouble if it's a bad job?
[3704.72s -> 3708.72s]  Or is this a game not smart enough to tell me that I did a bad job?
[3708.72s -> 3733.27s]  I can't get this last trip.
[3733.27s -> 3747.08s]  Wait, quest updated.
[3747.08s -> 3749.08s]  To cultivate field, go for your own harrow.
[3749.08s -> 3752.08s]  You'll find it by your barn.
[3752.08s -> 3753.08s]  What do you mean cultivate?
[3753.08s -> 3755.08s]  This is not cultivating.
[3755.08s -> 3756.08s]  What is this doing?
[3756.08s -> 3770.40s]  This is plowing.
[3770.40s -> 3771.40s]  All right.
[3771.40s -> 3773.40s]  No, I got to get that last piece.
[3773.40s -> 3774.40s]  I have to.
[3774.40s -> 3781.46s]  It's going to kill me.
[3781.46s -> 3782.46s]  I'm sorry, guys.
[3782.46s -> 3785.46s]  But yes, city boy, city boy, lol, omega lol.
[3785.46s -> 3786.46s]  Sure.
[3786.46s -> 3787.46s]  You can do your omega lols.
[3787.46s -> 3794.46s]  If I grabbed my fucking 80-year-old grandfather and I said, hey, grandpa, have you ever played
[3794.46s -> 3796.46s]  a video game before in your life?
[3796.46s -> 3797.46s]  No, not at all.
[3797.46s -> 3801.46s]  Hey, beat Dark Souls right now in front of me.
[3801.46s -> 3804.46s]  He'd be like, I don't even understand what this is.
[3804.46s -> 3805.46s]  What?
[3805.46s -> 3807.46s]  I'm not city boy.
[3807.46s -> 3821.42s]  I've never driven a plow before in my life.
[3821.42s -> 3823.42s]  I don't even know what this thing is.
[3823.42s -> 3829.56s]  Let's grind up the pavement.
[3829.56s -> 3846.05s]  No, no, not the sunflowers.
[3846.05s -> 3847.05s]  Those are expensive.
[3847.05s -> 3849.54s]  What does it want me to do?
[3849.54s -> 3862.43s]  What the fuck am I supposed to do with this?
[3862.43s -> 3864.43s]  These are medieval torture devices.
[3864.43s -> 3868.62s]  Honestly, if you had lined these up, right?
[3868.62s -> 3872.62s]  Let's just say, for instance, that I had you blindfold, you take me to a space, you go
[3872.62s -> 3876.82s]  to a warehouse and you show me that on the ground.
[3876.82s -> 3879.25s]  I'm going to think, oh, what is that?
[3879.25s -> 3882.25s]  I'm going to say, oh, that's they put people on that in the medieval times and they like
[3882.25s -> 3885.25s]  stretched them out and like stabbed them and shit.
[3885.25s -> 3888.58s]  I wouldn't know what the hell this was.
[3888.58s -> 3895.00s]  All right.
[3895.00s -> 3896.00s]  I need to attach that.
[3896.00s -> 3898.46s]  You have fixed.
[3898.46s -> 3900.46s]  You have fixed your garage.
[3900.46s -> 3903.42s]  Congratulations.
[3903.42s -> 3904.42s]  Your neighbors appreciate your work.
[3904.42s -> 3907.42s]  You received 5000 points.
[3907.42s -> 3914.95s]  Somebody fixed my garage for me and they didn't have the heart to tell me.
[3914.95s -> 3915.95s]  All right.
[3915.95s -> 3916.95s]  I'm fucking up all my weed.
[3916.95s -> 3917.95s]  How do I drop this thing?
[3917.95s -> 3918.95s]  Drop it.
[3918.95s -> 3926.34s]  Is this mine?
[3926.34s -> 3932.76s]  Why would they put it here?
[3932.76s -> 3937.09s]  People are just doing chores for me.
[3937.09s -> 3939.71s]  I think people feel bad for me.
[3939.71s -> 3946.58s]  All right.
[3946.58s -> 3947.58s]  Now bring it back.
[3947.58s -> 3950.58s]  Go back to Clara and cultivate her field.
[3950.58s -> 3971.26s]  Cultivate the pavement.
[3971.26s -> 3977.42s]  I'm going.
[3977.42s -> 3984.21s]  Can I break these things?
[3984.21s -> 3992.38s]  Oh, the noise this would make.
[3992.38s -> 4009.55s]  Go around me.
[4009.55s -> 4010.55s]  Go around me.
[4010.55s -> 4017.91s]  Go around me.
[4017.91s -> 4019.41s]  An idiot.
[4019.41s -> 4034.78s]  I would put like a little sound board up here and have like choo-choo sounds.
[4038.97s -> 4039.97s]  That was a pogchamp moment.
[4039.97s -> 4041.97s]  I would not have made it through that.
[4041.97s -> 4043.97s]  Do you see how narrow that was?
[4043.97s -> 4044.97s]  All right.
[4044.97s -> 4045.97s]  Cultivate the field.
[4045.97s -> 4047.97s]  I have a new strategy.
[4047.97s -> 4048.97s]  It's called go horizontal.
[4048.97s -> 4049.97s]  You ready?
[4049.97s -> 4054.60s]  Wait, wait.
[4054.60s -> 4057.10s]  What the hell am I doing right now?
[4057.10s -> 4060.55s]  Am I just redoing the thing?
[4060.55s -> 4062.55s]  Is this going back to what I am?
[4062.55s -> 4068.22s]  Am I just making it go back the way it was?
[4068.22s -> 4072.77s]  Why did you make me do all this?
[4072.77s -> 4081.79s]  You're stealing your neighbor's crops.
[4081.79s -> 4083.79s]  It's really bad for your socials.
[4083.79s -> 4085.79s]  What do you mean cultivating?
[4085.79s -> 4088.79s]  This was the exact same way it looked before.
[4088.79s -> 4098.01s]  This is the idiot test.
[4098.01s -> 4101.25s]  You know that funny business card that somebody pulls out where it says,
[4101.25s -> 4102.25s]  this is the idiot test.
[4102.25s -> 4104.25s]  Turn around to find the answer.
[4104.25s -> 4107.25s]  And then on the other side, this is the idiot test.
[4107.25s -> 4109.25s]  Turn around to find the answer.
[4109.25s -> 4111.25s]  And I turn it around five, 10 times.
[4111.25s -> 4112.25s]  I idiot.
[4112.25s -> 4114.25s]  That's what I'm doing right now.
[4114.25s -> 4117.25s]  This is the idiot test business card joke.
[4117.25s -> 4131.26s]  I should just go steal all their crops.
[4131.26s -> 4133.26s]  Do I care about my social score?
[4133.26s -> 4139.45s]  Do I care if I have a bunch of haters?
[4139.45s -> 4144.06s]  That's all that means, right?
[4144.06s -> 4162.17s]  This is not going as bad.
[4162.17s -> 4167.80s]  Do you care about getting arrested?
[4167.80s -> 4174.54s]  Okay, the only warning that popped up on my screen was,
[4174.54s -> 4179.54s]  hey, some people on social media aren't going to like you anymore.
[4179.54s -> 4182.54s]  But here's $700,000 worth of crops.
[4182.54s -> 4200.52s]  Oh, you're going to lose like 12 Facebook friends.
[4201.52s -> 4205.59s]  But gain a million dollars.
[4205.59s -> 4221.46s]  He's fucking calling me.
[4221.46s -> 4223.96s]  Is money all that you care about?
[4223.96s -> 4225.52s]  No.
[4225.52s -> 4235.95s]  It's one of the only things I get.
[4235.95s -> 4236.95s]  No.
[4236.95s -> 4240.47s]  People won't buy these crops.
[4240.47s -> 4244.47s]  Well, then I'll just store them in my silo for when fucking Armageddon happens.
[4244.47s -> 4267.19s]  What is this pattern?
[4267.19s -> 4271.56s]  I call this pattern late game space invaders.
[4271.56s -> 4286.09s]  This pattern is called.
[4286.09s -> 4301.64s]  I'm supposed to use this machine on the Wii.
[4301.64s -> 4305.64s]  Now, that would be really, really funny if I believed you,
[4305.64s -> 4308.01s]  because then I would just drive over it and go,
[4308.01s -> 4312.01s]  oh, I'm supposed to be here doing like tilling her wheat.
[4312.01s -> 4314.01s]  Right. Okay.
[4314.01s -> 4317.57s]  But you're a little late.
[4317.57s -> 4337.49s]  I accidentally already drove over a portion of it and it told me stop.
[4337.49s -> 4342.65s]  Yeah, this this outfit isn't looks intentional.
[4342.65s -> 4355.55s]  Like I'm dressed up to be on this tractor.
[4355.55s -> 4356.55s]  Almost done.
[4356.55s -> 4363.50s]  Dressed to catch Pokemon.
[4363.50s -> 4375.84s]  Lower it. Your character is honestly shit.
[4375.84s -> 4378.84s]  Can I join your server to kick your ass?
[4378.84s -> 4388.54s]  All right. I better get something good for this because this was like two.
[4388.54s -> 4389.54s]  This is two.
[4389.54s -> 4391.54s]  Clara seems to be really fond of you.
[4391.54s -> 4392.54s]  Got it.
[4392.54s -> 4396.92s]  Work done.
[4396.92s -> 4399.92s]  You may keep the plow, but you can still talk to Clara.
[4399.92s -> 4401.92s]  See if she can teach you something.
[4401.92s -> 4404.74s]  Nice.
[4404.74s -> 4405.74s]  I don't even need to do the rest.
[4405.74s -> 4406.74s]  Who cares?
[4406.74s -> 4410.23s]  You received the plow and five hundred social points.
[4410.23s -> 4411.79s]  Good.
[4411.79s -> 4417.00s]  All right. Let's go to let's go talk to Clara.
[4417.00s -> 4422.25s]  Oh, wait, I have to do my have to fix my house.
[4422.25s -> 4425.60s]  Where was Clara?
[4425.60s -> 4426.60s]  She's over here, right?
[4426.60s -> 4440.74s]  This is her farm right here, right?
[4440.74s -> 4441.74s]  Oh, lift this up.
[4441.74s -> 4444.58s]  All right.
[4444.58s -> 4445.58s]  Clara.
[4445.58s -> 4448.87s]  What can you teach me?
[4448.87s -> 4458.02s]  Getting stuck.
[4458.02s -> 4460.29s]  Hey.
[4460.29s -> 4464.34s]  Okay.
[4464.34s -> 4466.34s]  I thought that was this guy's hair.
[4466.34s -> 4470.80s]  For a second, it looked like he had like a weird clown hair.
[4470.80s -> 4471.80s]  Okay.
[4471.80s -> 4472.80s]  Can I help you, sweetheart?
[4472.80s -> 4473.80s]  Sure.
[4473.80s -> 4474.80s]  I'm kind of green.
[4474.80s -> 4476.80s]  Can you tell me a bit about field work?
[4476.80s -> 4477.80s]  Sure.
[4477.80s -> 4479.80s]  What do you need to know?
[4479.80s -> 4482.19s]  What about seeds?
[4482.19s -> 4483.19s]  How do I prepare fields?
[4483.19s -> 4484.19s]  How do I gather crops?
[4484.19s -> 4485.19s]  Anything more?
[4485.19s -> 4489.07s]  What about seeds?
[4489.07s -> 4492.38s]  It's best to buy these in the agro store.
[4492.38s -> 4495.38s]  You'll get most crops using prepared seeds.
[4495.38s -> 4496.38s]  Oh, cool.
[4496.38s -> 4497.38s]  Okay.
[4497.38s -> 4498.38s]  And fertilizing.
[4498.38s -> 4502.81s]  You can buy good fertilizers in the store and spray them on your fields.
[4502.81s -> 4503.81s]  Okay.
[4503.81s -> 4504.81s]  Let me get this.
[4504.81s -> 4507.81s]  But if you have animals, use manure to fertilize fields, too.
[4507.81s -> 4508.81s]  Oh, I can get animals?
[4508.81s -> 4509.81s]  If you combine these.
[4509.81s -> 4510.81s]  I got to go.
[4510.81s -> 4511.81s]  No more quests.
[4511.81s -> 4512.81s]  I got to go fix my shit.
[4512.81s -> 4515.81s]  Use different machines for these, of course.
[4515.81s -> 4518.01s]  Thanks.
[4518.01s -> 4519.01s]  I'll see you around.
[4519.01s -> 4529.59s]  All right.
[4529.59s -> 4532.59s]  I have to do the main storyline quest.
[4532.59s -> 4545.71s]  No, I'll lose points.
[4545.71s -> 4547.71s]  I was going to just take out the whole thing.
[4547.71s -> 4551.68s]  I was going to do every single flower.
[4551.68s -> 4553.68s]  It was going to be gone.
[4553.68s -> 4559.44s]  I can't fucking leave this way.
[4559.44s -> 4561.58s]  I want to just ditch it.
[4561.58s -> 4563.58s]  I just can't do this GTA style.
[4563.58s -> 4565.58s]  When you get stuck, you just run.
[4565.58s -> 4580.83s]  Okay.
[4580.83s -> 4581.83s]  I'm almost out.
[4581.83s -> 4582.83s]  Where's the exit?
[4582.83s -> 4587.40s]  Jump it.
[4587.40s -> 4588.40s]  I can't jump with this thing.
[4588.40s -> 4589.40s]  I have to go all the way out.
[4589.40s -> 4590.40s]  Can I take all the...
[4590.40s -> 4591.40s]  No.
[4591.40s -> 4592.40s]  All right.
[4592.40s -> 4593.40s]  Day one is almost done.
[4593.40s -> 4595.58s]  I still have to sleep.
[4595.58s -> 4600.59s]  Okay.
[4600.59s -> 4601.59s]  I almost got it.
[4601.59s -> 4602.59s]  That was close.
[4602.59s -> 4605.50s]  All right.
[4605.50s -> 4606.50s]  Back to home.
[4606.50s -> 4616.63s]  You can have animals.
[4616.63s -> 4620.38s]  Can I just have an animal farm?
[4620.38s -> 4623.38s]  What if I don't want to do crops?
[4623.38s -> 4629.30s]  Where's my truck?
[4629.30s -> 4631.73s]  I have no idea.
[4631.73s -> 4633.73s]  I'm going too fast.
[4633.73s -> 4638.66s]  I just have thousands of ducks.
[4638.66s -> 4640.02s]  Okay.
[4640.02s -> 4644.91s]  That actually sounds like pretty fun.
[4644.91s -> 4647.91s]  I'm not sure which garage is the garage I'm supposed to use to park anything.
[4647.91s -> 4648.91s]  All right.
[4648.91s -> 4651.94s]  Here I am.
[4651.94s -> 4657.06s]  I need to repair this barn.
[4657.06s -> 4658.06s]  Your animals live here.
[4658.06s -> 4661.06s]  Keep this building in good shape so your animals grow healthy.
[4661.06s -> 4663.06s]  Are there animals even in here already?
[4663.06s -> 4664.06s]  There's no animals even in here.
[4664.06s -> 4666.75s]  If they are, this is horrible.
[4666.75s -> 4668.06s]  All right.
[4668.06s -> 4669.06s]  Let me fix this stuff.
[4669.06s -> 4677.76s]  I'm not even going to scrape the extra bits off.
[4677.76s -> 4684.57s]  Okay.
[4684.57s -> 4685.57s]  Repair the bricks.
[4685.57s -> 4686.57s]  Go down here.
[4686.57s -> 4689.94s]  Is it supposed to look like that?
[4689.94s -> 4705.07s]  Okay.
[4705.07s -> 4706.07s]  The door.
[4706.07s -> 4717.98s]  What else is he fixing up there?
[4717.98s -> 4718.98s]  Can I get it?
[4718.98s -> 4719.98s]  I can reach from here.
[4719.98s -> 4720.98s]  Good.
[4720.98s -> 4730.66s]  The ceiling is fucked.
[4730.66s -> 4732.66s]  It still looks like shit.
[4732.66s -> 4735.66s]  Can I replace all the brick eventually?
[4735.66s -> 4740.72s]  This looks horrible.
[4740.72s -> 4741.90s]  I can't even paint it.
[4741.90s -> 4752.20s]  There's still a hole here.
[4752.20s -> 4763.81s]  Something wrong with the tub?
[4763.81s -> 4768.86s]  What's the first animal you guys want?
[4768.86s -> 4776.18s]  Duck?
[4776.18s -> 4779.18s]  These ducks are going to give you a bad Yelp review.
[4779.18s -> 4780.18s]  What is this?
[4780.18s -> 4781.18s]  An Airbnb?
[4781.18s -> 4789.40s]  Okay.
[4789.40s -> 4801.03s]  Is this still fucked up?
[4801.03s -> 4803.03s]  Witcher senses.
[4803.03s -> 4805.85s]  What is this?
[4805.85s -> 4807.85s]  It's more like Hitman, actually.
[4807.85s -> 4814.78s]  All right.
[4814.78s -> 4816.78s]  I don't even want to get on the roof.
[4816.78s -> 4818.78s]  Why use the scaffolding when you can just look up?
[4818.78s -> 4837.51s]  That's a lot of info up on that HUD.
[4837.51s -> 4838.51s]  Too much info.
[4838.51s -> 4849.26s]  Only if it were this easy in real life.
[4849.26s -> 4850.26s]  If only.
[4850.26s -> 4851.95s]  All right.
[4851.95s -> 4852.95s]  How are we doing?
[4852.95s -> 4853.95s]  Outside look all right?
[4853.95s -> 4857.28s]  I have to get up there with a scaffold.
[4857.28s -> 4858.28s]  Where's my scaffold?
[4858.28s -> 4861.89s]  How do I remove the scaffolds?
[4861.89s -> 4863.89s]  The whole place is going to be covered in scaffolding.
[4863.89s -> 4864.89s]  It's going to look terrible.
[4864.89s -> 4870.88s]  Can I remove all this rotted wood?
[4870.88s -> 4887.84s]  This is the aesthetic.
[4887.84s -> 4890.14s]  That's not a good aesthetic.
[4890.14s -> 4907.36s]  There's so much work to do here.
[4907.36s -> 4909.73s]  I'm not even close.
[4909.73s -> 4913.63s]  Is there a watch?
[4913.63s -> 4927.14s]  You be a real farmer.
[4927.14s -> 4928.14s]  Use the sun.
[4928.14s -> 4929.50s]  I mean, it's about to go down.
[4929.50s -> 4931.50s]  What happens at night?
[4931.50s -> 4935.02s]  Is there any downside to being out here at night?
[4935.02s -> 4936.02s]  It doesn't even matter.
[4936.02s -> 4950.87s]  Zombies.
[4950.87s -> 4954.07s]  You have to kill stuff with a nail gun.
[4954.07s -> 4957.53s]  I mean, I'll tell you one thing about this game.
[4957.53s -> 4958.53s]  You can say whatever you want.
[4958.53s -> 4959.53s]  It doesn't matter what you say.
[4959.53s -> 4961.53s]  You could say, oh, this is stupid.
[4961.53s -> 4962.53s]  This is great.
[4962.53s -> 4966.96s]  Sound is that nail gun sound is fantastic.
[4966.96s -> 4968.96s]  It sounds great.
[4968.96s -> 4976.79s]  All right.
[4976.79s -> 4979.67s]  So this is almost as this dollar done.
[4979.67s -> 4983.64s]  Let me use my spider sense.
[4983.64s -> 4984.64s]  Slurry tank.
[4984.64s -> 4988.88s]  When your animals produce slurry, it's deposed from here to be used as fertilizer.
[4988.88s -> 4991.88s]  You need a dedicated spreader for this task.
[4991.88s -> 4992.88s]  Wait.
[4992.88s -> 4993.88s]  What do you mean?
[4993.88s -> 4996.57s]  When my animals produce slurry.
[4996.57s -> 4997.57s]  Why do you have to call it slurry?
[4997.57s -> 5001.02s]  Just think good to go.
[5001.02s -> 5002.02s]  That sounds gross as fuck.
[5002.02s -> 5011.74s]  It does because it is.
[5011.74s -> 5012.74s]  Oh, man.
[5012.74s -> 5014.74s]  This is all rundown.
[5014.74s -> 5029.29s]  How many times do I have to do?
[5029.29s -> 5032.55s]  OK, not that much more.
[5032.55s -> 5034.55s]  And then we get our first animal.
[5034.55s -> 5042.00s]  Are they expensive?
[5042.00s -> 5048.36s]  I mean, how do you get money?
[5048.36s -> 5050.36s]  I have to sell crops and shit.
[5050.36s -> 5053.18s]  I don't have any crops.
[5053.18s -> 5054.18s]  Get an animal.
[5054.18s -> 5055.18s]  All right.
[5055.18s -> 5070.50s]  I'm going to buy an animal.
[5070.50s -> 5074.87s]  How much is it?
[5074.87s -> 5075.87s]  How much is a duck?
[5075.87s -> 5076.87s]  Less than 100 bucks.
[5076.87s -> 5077.87s]  All right.
[5077.87s -> 5078.87s]  This shit is done.
[5078.87s -> 5082.35s]  It has to be.
[5082.35s -> 5083.35s]  I don't see anything else.
[5083.35s -> 5084.35s]  Cows owned.
[5084.35s -> 5085.35s]  The whole thing's repaired, right?
[5085.35s -> 5088.90s]  Oh, come on.
[5088.90s -> 5096.92s]  I think this is cows only.
[5096.92s -> 5097.92s]  You fixed your cow shed.
[5097.92s -> 5098.92s]  Your neighbors appreciate your work.
[5098.92s -> 5099.92s]  You receive 5,000 social points.
[5099.92s -> 5102.57s]  Cool.
[5102.57s -> 5103.57s]  How do I get a cow?
[5103.57s -> 5104.57s]  Do they live here?
[5104.57s -> 5105.57s]  Social points.
[5105.57s -> 5106.57s]  How do I get a cow?
[5106.57s -> 5107.57s]  Hen house.
[5107.57s -> 5108.57s]  Your poultry lives here.
[5108.57s -> 5110.70s]  Keep this building in good shape.
[5110.70s -> 5111.70s]  All right.
[5111.70s -> 5112.70s]  I get it.
[5112.70s -> 5125.08s]  I get it.
[5125.08s -> 5128.50s]  I get it.
[5128.50s -> 5129.50s]  I get it.
[5129.50s -> 5138.10s]  I get it.
[5138.10s -> 5139.10s]  I get it.
[5143.47s -> 5144.47s]  Hen house.
[5144.47s -> 5145.47s]  Your poultry lives here.
[5145.47s -> 5146.47s]  Keep this building in good shape.
[5146.47s -> 5147.47s]  All right.
[5147.47s -> 5151.98s]  I guess I just have to repair everything.
[5151.98s -> 5161.91s]  This doesn't have as much damage as the other one.
[5161.91s -> 5162.91s]  It's getting dark out.
[5162.91s -> 5164.47s]  Yeah.
[5164.47s -> 5168.61s]  I don't think it matters.
[5168.61s -> 5173.29s]  I truly don't think there are any consequences for not eating and not sleeping.
[5173.29s -> 5187.54s]  Almost done with this.
[5187.54s -> 5190.82s]  You will die.
[5190.82s -> 5192.54s]  You don't die in this game.
[5192.54s -> 5198.58s]  They did not program in dying, except in the very beginning when your grandfather died.
[5198.58s -> 5200.78s]  That's the only death that's programmed into the game.
[5200.78s -> 5220.54s]  So get a roof.
[5220.54s -> 5221.54s]  How do we...
[5221.54s -> 5225.51s]  Can I put lights in here?
[5225.51s -> 5233.01s]  If you don't eat, you're going to lose social points.
[5233.01s -> 5239.90s]  That would be actually pretty funny.
[5239.90s -> 5240.90s]  What's left?
[5240.90s -> 5241.90s]  One more.
[5241.90s -> 5243.26s]  One more section and then we can get...
[5243.26s -> 5245.78s]  I'm going to go to the store.
[5245.78s -> 5249.30s]  I'm going to steal a bunch of crops, sell the crops and then buy some hens.
[5249.30s -> 5251.30s]  I think that's the plan here.
[5251.30s -> 5253.57s]  What else?
[5253.57s -> 5260.69s]  Anything else broken?
[5260.69s -> 5262.43s]  Didn't tell me I did it.
[5262.67s -> 5263.67s]  Hey, congratulations.
[5263.67s -> 5265.19s]  You completed the hen house.
[5265.19s -> 5268.29s]  Why?
[5268.29s -> 5280.00s]  Oh, because of this.
[5280.00s -> 5282.34s]  To sleep in the hen house.
[5282.34s -> 5283.34s]  I would if I could.
[5283.34s -> 5289.25s]  I probably can.
[5289.25s -> 5290.25s]  What is this?
[5290.25s -> 5307.25s]  Is that where I can place the hen houses?
[5307.25s -> 5309.05s]  I have to buy a hen house then.
[5309.05s -> 5310.48s]  All right.
[5310.48s -> 5312.76s]  Here we go.
[5312.76s -> 5314.24s]  Actual fucking...
[5314.24s -> 5315.36s]  Actual thing going to happen on stream.
[5315.36s -> 5316.36s]  Can you believe it?
[5316.36s -> 5333.02s]  We're going to get a hen tomorrow.
[5333.02s -> 5337.75s]  Hen house is almost done and that's it.
[5337.75s -> 5339.31s]  Neighbors appreciate it.
[5339.31s -> 5340.99s]  Three thousand social points.
[5340.99s -> 5350.45s]  What time is it?
[5350.45s -> 5351.45s]  What is all this?
[5351.45s -> 5355.03s]  Field owner you.
[5355.03s -> 5358.34s]  Canola ready for harvest.
[5358.34s -> 5360.86s]  Shift plus left click to sell this field.
[5360.86s -> 5365.34s]  How much do I get if I sell it?
[5365.34s -> 5368.93s]  What am I going to sell on it?
[5368.93s -> 5369.93s]  All right.
[5369.93s -> 5370.93s]  Complete.
[5370.93s -> 5379.05s]  I get to finish the repairs on the house.
[5379.05s -> 5380.05s]  How tired am I?
[5380.05s -> 5383.48s]  Your condition depends.
[5383.48s -> 5387.58s]  So what does this even mean?
[5387.58s -> 5388.58s]  Humidity dry.
[5388.58s -> 5389.58s]  Animals.
[5389.58s -> 5390.58s]  Dogs?
[5391.14s -> 5392.14s]  Cats?
[5392.14s -> 5393.14s]  Cows?
[5393.14s -> 5394.14s]  Hens?
[5394.14s -> 5395.14s]  Ducks?
[5395.14s -> 5400.34s]  Geese?
[5400.34s -> 5401.34s]  Pigeons?
[5401.34s -> 5402.65s]  Eggs?
[5402.65s -> 5403.65s]  I can get geese?
[5403.65s -> 5404.65s]  That's cool.
[5404.65s -> 5405.65s]  All right.
[5405.65s -> 5407.91s]  I'm just going to go to bed.
[5407.91s -> 5410.05s]  I want light.
[5410.05s -> 5411.05s]  Where is my bed?
[5411.05s -> 5412.61s]  One of these is my house.
[5412.61s -> 5413.61s]  Here it is.
[5413.61s -> 5418.24s]  Right?
[5418.24s -> 5424.60s]  Do I have a bed?
[5424.60s -> 5426.92s]  Why do I have two twin beds?
[5426.92s -> 5430.02s]  Okay.
[5430.02s -> 5438.42s]  Hold on.
[5438.42s -> 5445.14s]  Did I just sleep for a week?
[5445.14s -> 5446.14s]  Sleep on bed.
[5446.14s -> 5458.74s]  Rest for a week.
[5458.74s -> 5461.58s]  Am I okay?
[5461.58s -> 5462.58s]  I haven't eaten in a week.
[5462.58s -> 5472.30s]  Good thing I have a tomato in my inventory.
[5472.30s -> 5473.30s]  Start the music again.
[5473.30s -> 5476.46s]  All right.
[5476.46s -> 5477.46s]  That's my pantry.
[5477.46s -> 5483.64s]  Why would you have a pantry in the basement?
[5483.64s -> 5486.20s]  I have no idea what that function is for.
[5486.20s -> 5490.42s]  Why does that exist?
[5490.42s -> 5493.58s]  Why would you have sleep for a week be an option?
[5493.58s -> 5500.89s]  What does it do if you get injured?
[5500.89s -> 5510.32s]  And by the way, speaking of something, there's like four or five bedrooms in this house.
[5510.32s -> 5512.04s]  Can I actually get a family in here?
[5512.04s -> 5518.32s]  Look at all these rooms.
[5518.32s -> 5519.32s]  There's a seesaw.
[5519.32s -> 5521.74s]  I'll fix that seesaw.
[5521.74s -> 5522.74s]  I'm getting married too.
[5522.74s -> 5525.14s]  Oh, you thought we were going to play this game for like 10 minutes.
[5525.14s -> 5526.14s]  Wow.
[5526.14s -> 5528.32s]  You were so wrong.
[5528.32s -> 5529.32s]  That couldn't have been more incorrect.
[5529.32s -> 5536.77s]  All right.
[5536.77s -> 5541.85s]  Is the roof all right?
[5541.85s -> 5542.85s]  Do not misunderstand me.
[5542.85s -> 5549.18s]  We will never play this game ever again after probably the next day or so, but I ain't playing
[5549.18s -> 5550.18s]  this for 10 minutes.
[5550.18s -> 5560.44s]  All right.
[5560.44s -> 5561.44s]  What about the outside?
[5562.21s -> 5586.48s]  Oh, it's in fucking shambles.
[5586.48s -> 5587.48s]  Go harvest your crops.
[5587.48s -> 5591.27s]  I don't have any crops.
[5591.27s -> 5609.98s]  This is the game wants me to, I don't have any children with multiple slides.
[5609.98s -> 5610.98s]  Rusty metal.
[5610.98s -> 5613.06s]  I'm just shaving down the rusty metal.
[5613.06s -> 5616.63s]  Just buy a new one.
[5616.63s -> 5617.63s]  How much are these?
[5617.63s -> 5622.24s]  How much is a seesaw?
[5622.24s -> 5627.83s]  Like it can't be more than like 30 bucks, 40 bucks.
[5627.83s -> 5628.83s]  Repair of the old wood.
[5629.11s -> 5630.19s]  Oh, this is like dangerous.
[5630.19s -> 5632.23s]  Just get a new one.
[5632.23s -> 5633.23s]  Replace the sand in here.
[5633.23s -> 5634.67s]  This is fucking gross.
[5634.67s -> 5643.16s]  There's like shards of glass in here.
[5643.16s -> 5644.84s]  Make sure you repair the rotten wood.
[5644.84s -> 5659.01s]  Can you, can I push somebody on the slide eventually?
[5659.01s -> 5660.01s]  Wow.
[5660.01s -> 5662.18s]  That would be so cool.
[5662.18s -> 5663.34s]  This is my farm.
[5663.34s -> 5664.34s]  This is my house.
[5664.34s -> 5671.66s]  Ain't nobody going to take this from me until the storyline dictates when it should happen.
[5671.66s -> 5673.94s]  But for now, it's mine.
[5689.49s -> 5695.25s]  Wait till we have an Oliver, Oliver's going to turn on me.
[5695.25s -> 5699.10s]  Highly doubt it.
[5699.10s -> 5700.10s]  Air bricks.
[5700.10s -> 5703.96s]  Can't reach it.
[5703.96s -> 5704.96s]  Better get a scaffolding.
[5704.96s -> 5707.12s]  But let's check the outside bed.
[5707.12s -> 5709.88s]  Sleeping regularly helps you maintain good health and energy for work.
[5709.88s -> 5711.62s]  Combine sleep with good food.
[5711.62s -> 5716.93s]  You might miss job opportunities when hungry and tired.
[5716.93s -> 5718.41s]  Or for sleeping for a full week.
[5718.41s -> 5720.69s]  I think that's the easiest way to miss an opportunity.
[5720.69s -> 5735.00s]  I don't think that has to do with if I'm hungry today.
[5735.00s -> 5737.14s]  You can use it to turn basic foods into canned ones.
[5737.14s -> 5739.02s]  A wife can cook delicious treats.
[5739.02s -> 5742.16s]  I don't have a wife.
[5742.16s -> 5746.35s]  You're losing food from the pantry.
[5746.35s -> 5752.52s]  Who's this imaginary wife that I have?
[5752.52s -> 5754.24s]  Do I need to get married?
[5754.24s -> 5755.24s]  I just got here.
[5755.24s -> 5762.27s]  I don't know any of these fucking people.
[5762.27s -> 5779.70s]  All right.
[5779.70s -> 5785.18s]  We're almost at the, I have to go all the way up really.
[5785.18s -> 5786.66s]  That looks worse than like it did before.
[5786.66s -> 5791.35s]  How's the outside?
[5791.35s -> 5792.35s]  All right.
[5792.35s -> 5793.35s]  Time to go up to the second floor.
[5793.35s -> 5800.27s]  That's a gigantic chimney.
[5800.27s -> 5801.27s]  You can cut that in half.
[5801.27s -> 5803.26s]  It would still be fine.
[5803.26s -> 5805.86s]  It's a Minecraft house chimney.
[5805.86s -> 5806.86s]  That's too big.
[5806.86s -> 5811.42s]  Let's get up.
[5811.42s -> 5812.42s]  Hey.
[5812.42s -> 5820.83s]  Do I have a well?
[5820.83s -> 5822.83s]  Can I get water out of the well?
[5822.83s -> 5825.15s]  Look at all this other shit I have to repair.
[5825.15s -> 5829.78s]  Can I not go up?
[5829.78s -> 5840.43s]  Shit.
[5840.43s -> 5847.87s]  I gotta go this way.
[5847.87s -> 5848.87s]  Delete the scaffolding.
[5848.87s -> 5857.47s]  All right.
[5857.47s -> 5859.74s]  Let's get up there.
[5859.74s -> 5860.74s]  All right.
[5860.74s -> 5862.30s]  Repair and another scaffolding.
[5862.30s -> 5863.30s]  God damn it.
[5863.30s -> 5872.73s]  Am I going to play Half-Life Alex on stream?
[5872.73s -> 5875.54s]  Probably not.
[5876.54s -> 5879.06s]  I mean, no, I don't think so.
[5879.06s -> 5881.78s]  No, I don't.
[5881.78s -> 5887.86s]  I mean, no, it's just probably one of the largest technological VR jumps in technology
[5887.86s -> 5891.42s]  and gaming and the history of virtual reality headsets.
[5891.42s -> 5896.30s]  I probably will play a free to play horror game that somebody made in three days next
[5896.30s -> 5911.46s]  time or a unity farmer game.
[5911.46s -> 5912.46s]  You don't know this is made in unity.
[5912.46s -> 5913.46s]  How do you know that?
[5913.46s -> 5915.80s]  How do you know this is made in unity?
[5915.80s -> 5916.80s]  You don't know.
[5916.80s -> 5921.10s]  How do you know?
[5921.10s -> 5923.01s]  It's not unity.
[5923.57s -> 5936.12s]  This is a proprietary engine that was crafted in-house.
[5936.12s -> 5947.29s]  For all you guys know, this could be better than the frostbite engine.
[5947.29s -> 5948.93s]  This runs better than frostbite engine.
[5948.93s -> 5949.93s]  So yeah.
[5949.93s -> 5952.00s]  All right.
[5952.00s -> 5954.32s]  We got I got to get in there.
[5954.32s -> 5955.96s]  The second floor is having problems.
[5955.96s -> 5958.00s]  Oh, my shins.
[5958.00s -> 5959.30s]  Don't worry.
[5959.30s -> 5960.30s]  Dad's okay.
[5960.30s -> 5961.30s]  Dad will be fine.
[5961.30s -> 5968.30s]  Upstairs.
[5968.30s -> 5973.51s]  What do you mean dad?
[5973.51s -> 5974.51s]  Question mark.
[5974.51s -> 5981.42s]  Who the fuck do you think I am in this scenario?
[5981.42s -> 5985.15s]  How would I not be dad?
[5985.15s -> 5988.41s]  I'm the only one here.
[5988.41s -> 6001.18s]  It's me, dad.
[6001.18s -> 6005.54s]  This one piece that's just broken somewhere and I'm never going to find it.
[6005.54s -> 6013.82s]  There it is.
[6013.82s -> 6015.98s]  Oh, fuck off with this.
[6015.98s -> 6016.98s]  Where is it?
[6016.98s -> 6036.10s]  It's the door.
[6036.10s -> 6037.10s]  Where is the problem?
[6037.10s -> 6050.45s]  What's the issue here?
[6050.45s -> 6053.87s]  What happens if I just sleep for a week?
[6053.87s -> 6055.47s]  Like a hundred times in a row?
[6055.47s -> 6059.59s]  Do we just teleport like 10 years in the future?
[6059.59s -> 6066.34s]  It's sleep.
[6066.34s -> 6069.78s]  Should I sleep for like 200 years and see what happens?
[6070.18s -> 6073.58s]  There's a chest.
[6073.58s -> 6074.58s]  Fish.
[6074.58s -> 6076.06s]  I thought it was a chainsaw.
[6076.06s -> 6079.82s]  Fish in aroma oil.
[6079.82s -> 6088.66s]  I don't think this is something you would take out of this chest.
[6088.66s -> 6091.98s]  You would throw this away, but I'm going to eat it.
[6091.98s -> 6095.50s]  But before I eat it, I need to like make a, I have to turn on my YouTube channel video.
[6095.50s -> 6098.78s]  I have to, yeah, I have to like videotape me doing this.
[6098.78s -> 6105.71s]  All right.
[6105.71s -> 6106.71s]  That's it.
[6106.71s -> 6107.95s]  Right?
[6107.95s -> 6112.46s]  What else is left to repair in the house?
[6112.46s -> 6114.97s]  There's nothing else here to fix.
[6114.97s -> 6116.09s]  Help me out here.
[6121.42s -> 6122.42s]  The fences outside.
[6122.42s -> 6123.42s]  Does that count as the house?
[6123.42s -> 6132.45s]  Did I miss a room?
[6132.45s -> 6142.58s]  I did.
[6142.58s -> 6143.58s]  Yeah.
[6143.58s -> 6144.58s]  All right.
[6144.58s -> 6152.78s]  This thing that I don't understand though, is this, all this stuff is like shitty.
[6152.78s -> 6155.46s]  Even if I, I want this different wallpaper.
[6155.46s -> 6159.63s]  Use the kitchen.
[6159.63s -> 6160.63s]  Applesauce.
[6160.63s -> 6162.70s]  Cookbook recipes.
[6162.70s -> 6165.38s]  What about honey based recipes?
[6165.38s -> 6166.82s]  Eggs.
[6166.82s -> 6167.82s]  Hot sauce.
[6167.82s -> 6169.31s]  Unknown.
[6169.31s -> 6170.31s]  Egg based.
[6170.31s -> 6171.31s]  I don't know any of these.
[6171.31s -> 6179.76s]  There's food here though, somehow.
[6180.12s -> 6182.16s]  I have to, it's the fence outside that's doing it.
[6182.16s -> 6183.16s]  Are you sure?
[6183.16s -> 6208.26s]  You might be right.
[6208.26s -> 6213.10s]  I kind of want to save the game and then sleep like fucking a hundred times and just skip
[6213.10s -> 6220.81s]  every cut scene and see if we can like teleport 10 years in the future.
[6220.81s -> 6233.29s]  See if the world changes at all.
[6233.29s -> 6234.79s]  Get a family first.
[6234.79s -> 6235.79s]  Yeah.
[6235.79s -> 6236.79s]  Yeah.
[6236.79s -> 6237.79s]  Let's get a family.
[6237.79s -> 6244.14s]  Let's have a wife, have a kid and then sleep for 30 years and see if the kid grows up.
[6244.14s -> 6245.14s]  That's not a bad play.
[6245.14s -> 6254.58s]  I like that play.
[6254.58s -> 6257.42s]  There is nothing else to fix over here.
[6257.42s -> 6259.46s]  Why have I not gotten any social points for this?
[6259.46s -> 6267.77s]  I'm going to piss my pants.
[6267.77s -> 6276.67s]  I'll be right back.
[6276.67s -> 6277.67s]  Pretty good condition.
[6277.67s -> 6278.67s]  No families.
[6278.67s -> 6279.67s]  11,000 points.
[6279.67s -> 6280.67s]  All right.
[6280.67s -> 6281.67s]  I'll be right back.
[6281.67s -> 6282.67s]  I'm going to pee my pants if I don't get the fuck out of here.
[6282.67s -> 6432.65s]  Right back.
[6432.65s -> 6433.65s]  I'm back.
[6433.65s -> 6435.93s]  I'm going to do this thing now where when I come back, I don't just go like this because
[6435.93s -> 6438.05s]  it means I'm gone for three minutes straight.
[6438.05s -> 6442.25s]  Hey, I'm back.
[6442.25s -> 6443.25s]  It's like, Jesus.
[6443.25s -> 6445.53s]  So I'm going to slowly be like, Hey, I'm back.
[6445.53s -> 6446.53s]  Okay, let's go.
[6446.53s -> 6457.50s]  All right.
[6457.50s -> 6463.46s]  The goal here is find a family and then try to artificially age them all by like 10 years.
[6463.46s -> 6467.75s]  Well, that's going to be such a waste of time.
[6467.75s -> 6475.01s]  You know how long that's going to take.
[6475.01s -> 6476.01s]  Game sucks.
[6476.01s -> 6477.01s]  Play Half-Life Alex.
[6477.01s -> 6484.26s]  Yeah.
[6484.26s -> 6486.62s]  So I'm just going to play this until Half-Life Alex comes out.
[6486.62s -> 6487.62s]  That's what you're saying, right?
[6487.62s -> 6488.62s]  Like, yeah, game sucks.
[6488.62s -> 6491.62s]  Like you should transition over to Half-Life Alex.
[6491.62s -> 6492.62s]  Yeah.
[6492.62s -> 6495.72s]  So in four months or five months, I'll just do this for five months.
[6495.72s -> 6501.89s]  That's what you want.
[6501.89s -> 6502.89s]  All right.
[6502.89s -> 6503.89s]  Game save.
[6503.89s -> 6504.89s]  Let's go.
[6504.89s -> 6506.71s]  Just got to fix some more stuff.
[6507.37s -> 6508.37s]  I'm into it right now.
[6508.37s -> 6509.37s]  I'm into this.
[6509.37s -> 6519.92s]  I need to see this through.
[6519.92s -> 6520.92s]  Harvest the wheat.
[6520.92s -> 6521.92s]  Get mad bucks.
[6521.92s -> 6522.92s]  I need to find out why this is not done.
[6522.92s -> 6530.95s]  Is there something on the roof I missed?
[6530.95s -> 6531.95s]  You've earned no money.
[6531.95s -> 6533.87s]  It's not all about the money.
[6533.87s -> 6535.68s]  Okay.
[6535.68s -> 6537.48s]  It's not about the money.
[6537.48s -> 6541.16s]  Sometimes it's about just having fun and relaxing and making a farm.
[6541.16s -> 6544.28s]  It's always about money with you guys.
[6544.28s -> 6545.56s]  Money, money, money.
[6545.56s -> 6549.18s]  You should make more money.
[6549.18s -> 6552.50s]  I'm always about how I want to just do something because I want to.
[6553.34s -> 6554.34s]  It's the basement.
[6554.34s -> 6565.03s]  Is it the basement?
[6565.03s -> 6568.55s]  That's such a huge fall and it's funny that it didn't happen.
[6568.55s -> 6572.34s]  No, there's nothing in here that's broken.
[6572.34s -> 6583.24s]  Nothing in here.
[6583.24s -> 6584.40s]  Damn it.
[6584.40s -> 6587.00s]  What is the one little thing that's wrong?
[6587.00s -> 6591.57s]  The well?
[6591.57s -> 6596.55s]  There's one tiny thing wrong with this house that I can't figure it out.
[6596.55s -> 6598.70s]  Hold on.
[6598.70s -> 6612.88s]  Is there no bathroom in this house?
[6612.88s -> 6624.90s]  We don't have a bathroom.
[6624.90s -> 6632.74s]  Why is there not a bathroom in the house?
[6632.74s -> 6641.32s]  It's a huge, huge issue if this is going the outhouse.
[6641.32s -> 6642.32s]  There is no outhouse.
[6642.32s -> 6645.84s]  Are we just supposed to shit into the well?
[6645.84s -> 6649.64s]  All right.
[6649.64s -> 6651.00s]  Well, I don't know what's wrong with it.
[6651.00s -> 6654.96s]  Is the gazebo broken?
[6654.96s -> 6656.44s]  No, this is normal.
[6656.44s -> 6658.84s]  It's ugly, but it's normal.
[6658.84s -> 6659.84s]  Grain storage.
[6659.84s -> 6660.84s]  Okay.
[6660.84s -> 6661.84s]  I have to make some money.
[6661.84s -> 6670.51s]  Dog house.
[6670.51s -> 6671.51s]  How do I get a dog?
[6671.51s -> 6672.51s]  I still don't understand what...
[6672.51s -> 6673.51s]  Wait, there it is.
[6673.51s -> 6678.52s]  I see it.
[6678.52s -> 6684.76s]  No, I don't.
[6684.76s -> 6685.76s]  What's the problem?
[6685.76s -> 6689.13s]  I've got to get up there before I delete this because there's a scaffolding all over the
[6689.13s -> 6690.13s]  damn house.
[6690.13s -> 6698.22s]  All right.
[6698.22s -> 6701.70s]  Delete it.
[6701.70s -> 6702.70s]  I don't want scaffolding on my house.
[6702.70s -> 6712.77s]  Delete it.
[6712.77s -> 6716.00s]  Follow the arrow.
[6716.00s -> 6717.48s]  What do I have for a mission?
[6717.48s -> 6722.30s]  Complete repairs on your farm.
[6722.30s -> 6724.50s]  I have this fucking dumb place.
[6724.50s -> 6728.64s]  God, this is going to be great.
[6728.64s -> 6733.46s]  Great.
[6733.46s -> 6734.46s]  Is it a balcony window?
[6734.46s -> 6741.80s]  I'll check it out in a minute.
[6741.80s -> 6746.22s]  We're not going to get a family unless I make this place a home.
[6746.22s -> 6755.38s]  I'm not going to impress anybody that comes over here if it's the exact same thing as
[6755.38s -> 6758.78s]  if to take somebody to like an old abandoned hospital.
[6758.78s -> 6760.72s]  Yeah.
[6760.72s -> 6761.72s]  You want to see where I live?
[6761.72s -> 6762.72s]  Yeah.
[6762.72s -> 6763.72s]  Let's go to you.
[6763.72s -> 6764.72s]  Let's go to your house.
[6764.72s -> 6767.24s]  Yeah.
[6767.24s -> 6768.24s]  Sure.
[6768.24s -> 6769.24s]  Come on over here.
[6769.24s -> 6770.42s]  Cool.
[6770.42s -> 6771.42s]  Yeah.
[6771.42s -> 6772.42s]  We're pulling up now.
[6772.42s -> 6773.42s]  What do you think?
[6773.42s -> 6774.42s]  What do you think about my old fucking haunted house YouTube channel?
[6774.42s -> 6775.42s]  Abandoned hospital.
[6775.42s -> 6778.38s]  Let's walk through it.
[6778.38s -> 6779.38s]  It has to look at least okay.
[6779.38s -> 6792.21s]  What is this?
[6792.21s -> 6793.21s]  Grain storage?
[6793.21s -> 6794.21s]  All right.
[6794.21s -> 6799.43s]  There's a lot of stuff I need to know.
[6799.43s -> 6800.43s]  What is all this?
[6800.43s -> 6801.43s]  Okay.
[6801.43s -> 6802.43s]  Stop.
[6802.43s -> 6803.43s]  Stop getting distracted.
[6803.43s -> 6804.43s]  That's the only thing only.
[6804.43s -> 6805.43s]  That's the only thing I need to do right now.
[6805.43s -> 6806.43s]  That's it.
[6806.43s -> 6809.34s]  Nothing else.
[6809.34s -> 6810.34s]  Repair only.
[6810.34s -> 6817.75s]  Make sure I save the game there too.
[6817.75s -> 6833.32s]  That would be such a painful disaster if this is like my I have my own gas station.
[6833.32s -> 6838.98s]  You have your own gas station on a farm.
[6838.98s -> 6846.35s]  I pull shit in there to pump my own tank.
[6846.35s -> 6848.34s]  That's kind of cool.
[6848.34s -> 6849.34s]  I got to get up.
[6849.34s -> 6861.46s]  Get up top.
[6861.46s -> 6871.96s]  I got to get all the way up though.
[6871.96s -> 6872.96s]  Yeah.
[6872.96s -> 6877.40s]  There we go.
[6877.40s -> 6878.40s]  Sit.
[6878.40s -> 6879.40s]  Sit.
[6879.40s -> 6888.45s]  Sit.
[6888.45s -> 6889.45s]  Shit all right.
[6889.45s -> 6890.45s]  He says sit.
[6890.45s -> 6891.45s]  Sit.
[6891.45s -> 6892.45s]  Sit.
[6892.45s -> 6893.45s]  Sit.
[6893.45s -> 6894.45s]  Sit.
[6894.45s -> 6899.78s]  Sit.
[6899.78s -> 6900.78s]  Sit.
[6900.78s -> 6901.78s]  It's not so bad getting up top in the middle.
[6901.78s -> 6905.71s]  Now, I don't want you to put me up top either, I don't want you out the bat.
[6905.71s -> 6907.93s]  All right, I'll mark this, I'll mark this.
[6907.93s -> 6908.81s]  I'm going to go on top of it.
[6908.81s -> 6914.77s]  I'm going to go on top of the camera man.
[6914.77s -> 6916.11s]  I'm going to try to make that count for a while or whatever.
[6916.11s -> 6919.07s]  I lost until m we're gonna get close to the wall which is the goal.
[6919.07s -> 6921.84s]  That was great.
[6921.84s -> 6922.84s]  Let's go.
[6922.84s -> 6923.84s]  Go.
[6923.84s -> 6924.84s]  Go.
[6924.84s -> 6925.84s]  Go.
[6925.84s -> 6936.30s]  Go.
[6936.30s -> 6943.48s]  real estate video game where you like buy build dress and sell a house don't
[6943.48s -> 6961.81s]  that's my idea that's my idea let it be known here at first the no not like a
[6961.81s -> 6964.89s]  tycoon game where you just put down monopoly buildings no I'm talking about
[6964.89s -> 6970.33s]  like you build with wood you build the houses and you do it the way you want oh
[6970.33s -> 6973.17s]  this one's gonna have a basement this one's gonna have an attic this one's
[6973.17s -> 6977.94s]  gonna have look at this big open concept in the living room you and you
[6977.94s -> 6981.78s]  did you design it you decorate it you put the furniture in and you sell it so
[6981.78s -> 6988.69s]  yeah minecraft but not blocks but real and you can't sell real estate in
[6988.69s -> 6997.29s]  Minecraft that's not minecraft what are you talking about so real life yes guys
[6997.29s -> 7002.77s]  like real life I'm gonna spend three four five hundred thousand dollars on a
[7002.77s -> 7006.91s]  built building no I want to be able to do it in fake life so I don't have to
[7006.91s -> 7023.19s]  spend any money what else needs to be repaired that but all right do I got
[7023.23s -> 7043.14s]  everything on the roof I think so which builds a house there's no way that would
[7043.14s -> 7051.73s]  work you know I thought of a stream a while back there actually this is during
[7051.73s -> 7056.39s]  the house flipper streams I was thinking about it would it be funny if I were to
[7056.39s -> 7065.82s]  try to actually like redecorate it like a house in real life just an open floor
[7065.82s -> 7070.30s]  with paint and stuff just put up like put up make build like three or four
[7070.34s -> 7081.63s]  artificial rooms and then decorate them and take you through it okay that's do
[7081.63s -> 7098.56s]  I think that's done oh fuck hello there's so many repairs to do they would
[7098.56s -> 7104.40s]  take too much effort ah it would take a lot of prep but I don't think it would
[7104.40s -> 7112.64s]  be too big all I would need to do is just put up like a wood and then just
[7112.64s -> 7119.86s]  have like some drywall just just make like a fake room in like a studio be at
[7119.86s -> 7124.86s]  beyond studio and have like three small rooms made that can have like couches
[7124.86s -> 7141.08s]  and furniture and stuff in them like a TV show set yeah that's I'm saying it
[7141.08s -> 7145.08s]  wouldn't be like a full house it would be like the Seinfeld set but I would
[7145.08s -> 7164.38s]  just have to decorate it and paint it dollhouse the German dollhouse have
[7164.38s -> 7168.26s]  multiple floors and what's just weird the camera zooms out I like walk up the
[7168.26s -> 7174.59s]  stairs I get into the bed oh this is comfy that would be real-life sims
[7174.63s -> 7181.12s]  god damn do I have to actually write this one down imagine if I made a
[7181.12s -> 7186.36s]  fucking dollhouse cut in half sort of like set and you guys just played the
[7186.36s -> 7214.76s]  sims but it was just me in a house that would be really really creepy that would
[7214.76s -> 7221.63s]  be scary in a way because I would be acting like a sim I wouldn't be
[7221.63s -> 7225.31s]  speaking English or anything I'd be talking like sim and you guys have to
[7225.31s -> 7233.16s]  tell me what to do I would be speaking simlish and waving at you guys and

[19563.00s -> 19584.28s]  again I need to get him on the roof but I can't I have to stop what if I turn the
[19584.28s -> 19622.57s]  volume down is that gonna go I had him it's so hard to keep it steady because
[19622.57s -> 19631.18s]  it just rips around in so many directions all right I thought I'm gonna
[19631.18s -> 19641.13s]  play the game I have to play the game now I have to stop I will sit here for
[19641.13s -> 19647.45s]  like three days and do this my brain is so fucked up I will be here all day last
[19647.45s -> 19671.55s]  chance here we go this is the last opportunity no the roof it's gonna kill

[19744.81s -> 19767.30s]  difficult this is the heart it's a harder than the last boss in secure no
[19767.30s -> 19771.94s]  no it's got you it's got to be in one fucking swoop it has to be perfect
[19771.94s -> 19786.80s]  he'll turn around go slower I can't trust me trust me look trust the guy
[19786.80s -> 19796.46s]  that's been doing this for two hours I trust me no not it wasn't perfect
[19796.78s -> 19807.42s]  because to be able to get under in the first place you have to go fast enough
[19807.42s -> 19811.90s]  for the game to why are you even explaining this even describing what I
[19811.90s -> 19818.85s]  have to can I use a controller I'd be probably harder what is the joke here
[19818.85s -> 19830.35s]  there is none I just want to pick him up and put him on the roof this is not a
[19830.35s -> 19847.94s]  joke I just like how my brain is just fucking fried and I have to do this I'm
[19847.94s -> 19856.74s]  like leaning back in my chair and shit my hands are sweating you see how I'm
[19856.74s -> 19859.90s]  like I have to glitch into the ground all right this is not a terrible
[19860.06s -> 19865.06s]  opportunity here and you got to get near the back wheels directly right in the
[19865.06s -> 19907.22s]  middle of the car I fucked it up no no you have to go up and then like scream
[19907.22s -> 19913.06s]  down so you get into the ground and then you're already going fast fuck roof fan
[19913.18s -> 19943.79s]  he's got it he's got it no he doesn't no shit it's too hard is too impossible I'm

[21247.29s -> 21250.73s]  only farming content that's been on the whole stream is scraping the dirt
[21250.73s -> 21308.30s]  sometimes this is so much bigger too this is five times larger how much it
[21308.30s -> 21311.38s]  what's your field is isn't this that doesn't count as your field right no

[21314.14s -> 21337.50s]  that was close no this is not even close it's just this how much I have to do
[21337.50s -> 21359.98s]  this is too much I got to do in chunks this is what you do when you farm so
[21359.98s -> 21366.57s]  farming is not driving around looking for tomatoes and desperately trying to
[21366.57s -> 21382.31s]  find a wife and flying a drone around this is what you do all right if I give
[21382.31s -> 21386.67s]  up right now can I just knock on her door and be like hey I'm done I don't
[21386.67s -> 21393.19s]  want to do anymore just can you pay me like 8% like 4% of what I was gonna get
[21393.19s -> 21401.74s]  I don't feel like doing this and I just have like if it was gonna cost like 500
[21401.74s -> 21410.62s]  bucks to do this can you just give me like $12 also also you want to get
[21410.62s -> 21420.49s]  married let's have a bunch of children too so please marry me
[21424.26s -> 21433.54s]  marry me you're giving us city folk a bad name why would anybody that lives in
[21433.54s -> 21441.32s]  the city know how to do this that's okay why would you expect somebody that has
[21441.32s -> 21460.29s]  lived in this city their whole life to be able to know how to plow a field is
[21460.29s -> 21478.26s]  it disappearing on me like I did this already like four times okay why don't I
[21478.26s -> 21487.95s]  just hire like 25 people to all bring their tractor and then we all start
[21487.99s -> 21494.30s]  side by side by side by side by side all start at the same time and just drive
[21494.30s -> 21510.20s]  forward once how much more work could we get done instead of taking 12 hours to
[21510.20s -> 21521.06s]  do this just do it in 12 minutes and then drive to the next one and in one
[21521.06s -> 21546.58s]  day we could do every single field in the whole county that's a utopian
[21546.58s -> 21553.46s]  utopian streamer he's a giant tractor that's another one too why not just
[21553.46s -> 21558.66s]  build a tractor that's just like this looks exactly the same except it's 100
[21558.66s -> 21568.04s]  times larger the seat could be the same size it's it's just as big as four or
[21568.04s -> 21577.49s]  five houses put together so you're just driving this huge-ass mothership across
[21577.49s -> 21601.06s]  the plane and doing it one just drive forward once you ever mowed a lawn
[21601.62s -> 21610.08s]  yes and if the lawnmower was as big as my house I could just sit it in the
[21610.08s -> 21614.32s]  backyard turn on the blades and then turn them off and the yard would be cut
[21614.32s -> 21621.78s]  now granted that would be a catastrophic death machine it would be
[21621.78s -> 21638.40s]  immensely dangerous but then you then you have a lawnmower instead of a yard
[21638.40s -> 21642.68s]  that the grass just grows up to the blades and then you turn on the giant
[21642.68s -> 21646.48s]  blades and then turn it off you don't even get a you don't have to get to
[21646.48s -> 21663.12s]  have a backyard no it would be on a mechanism that the blade was up like 60
[21663.12s -> 21667.24s]  feet like a hundred feet or something hovering over the yard you could play
[21667.24s -> 21670.04s]  out there you can have fun you can hang out back there and then you would lower
[21670.04s -> 21688.26s]  it down to cut the grass just don't have grass that's another one too just have
[21688.26s -> 21693.05s]  like just paved your backyard you know how much coolest shit you can have in
[21693.05s -> 21696.09s]  your backyard with a paved backyard you can have a basketball court you have
[21696.09s -> 21728.12s]  tennis courts what is all the rain go to the drain that you have built in the
[21728.12s -> 21733.02s]  middle of the backyard a huge drain you didn't think I thought about that a
[21733.02s -> 21737.98s]  giant drain that's connected to the sewer system and it just there you go you
[21737.98s -> 21740.34s]  can put a shower back there you could have like a bunch of showers in your
[21740.34s -> 21762.18s]  backyard draw a penis already all right well I'm gonna try to spell something
[21762.18s -> 21765.70s]  and I'll look at it with the drone I don't even care if I fuck up somebody's
[21766.14s -> 21795.14s]  I'll be done with this game in like 20 minutes anyway but does it have to be
[21795.14s -> 21813.92s]  this slow why can't you attach this to a go-kart those things go 20 no power to
[21813.92s -> 21844.78s]  pull time is it I'm like very tired and very hungry and it's like okay I guess
[21844.78s -> 21864.64s]  we're gonna just keep doing it it's almost done anyways I can't quit before
[21864.64s -> 21873.16s]  I have children all right but you know how long I'm
[21873.24s -> 21878.64s]  gonna have to play this game before I'm allowed to have children I know I wanted
[21878.64s -> 21887.70s]  to go into a coma for 20 years but I gotta get I have to get married just
[21887.70s -> 21922.63s]  don't fuck around with drones yes I can see what I've done it's bad it's really
[21922.63s -> 21928.00s]  bad I don't know that I just gonna stay with stick with what I was doing before
[21928.00s -> 21946.20s]  I'm not even close has it been 24 hours the Sun's about to come up you know bad

[24452.23s -> 24455.47s]  between 50,000 and 90,000 points if you're lower than 50,000 you might have
[24455.47s -> 24460.39s]  to talk to the ladies more often okay talk to ladies everywhere on the map I
[24460.39s -> 24464.95s]  talked to most of them got 50 social points per conversation complimenting

[24467.51s -> 24472.01s]  whole conversation I talked to the women about once every two days to make sure
[24472.01s -> 24480.73s]  the timer actually resets well I've been sleeping months in weeks since one game
[24480.73s -> 24484.69s]  hour is about five minutes that means 12 hours in game you can talk to the
[24484.69s -> 24497.06s]  ladies wait what you can only compliment them once per real hour since one game
[24497.06s -> 24524.73s]  hour is five minutes it means 12 hours in game to talk to them but I'm sleeping
[24524.73s -> 24547.85s]  for months I'm sleeping for months the clock on the PC put your computer clock
[24547.85s -> 24552.86s]  forward does that work hold on if I make my computer clock an hour ahead will it

[24570.15s -> 24574.83s]  it work yeah I guys why would that work this is not like a this is not a DS
[24574.83s -> 24596.47s]  just try it okay it's I'm making it I'm making it I'm gonna make it nine I'm
[24596.47s -> 24600.56s]  gonna make it ten o'clock what you're already doing is gonna work
[24600.56s -> 24623.17s]  adjust date and time okay set time to change date and time let's make it like
[24623.17s -> 24645.97s]  I don't know fucking ten like 10 p.m. 1041 p.m. I have to come back I have to
[24645.97s -> 24653.65s]  come back I don't know why that fucked up the stream I think the time
[24653.65s -> 24658.81s]  synchronization there it may I guess it's like that the twitch doesn't like
[24658.81s -> 24671.48s]  that so I don't know I'm not gonna do that you literally traveled to through
[24671.48s -> 24676.24s]  time okay I can't do that because the streaming software into twitch does not
[24676.24s -> 24683.02s]  like that I'm pretending it's 1040 p.m. for some reason it's counting how many
[24683.02s -> 24728.40s]  minutes you actually play great no I'm not gonna get a trainer you are not
[24728.40s -> 24735.88s]  going to watch me download a trainer and put it on this engine on stream and plus
[24735.88s -> 24739.00s]  the trainer doesn't even do anything the trainer gives you super speed and
[24739.00s -> 24745.42s]  unlimited money I can't change the time I can't change the time it's not good
[24745.42s -> 24755.88s]  that you can't change the time the stuff I was doing should work it doesn't care
[24755.88s -> 24763.84s]  how long I'm playing all right well hold on what if we do this is there a way I
[24763.84s -> 24766.84s]  can see a watch what if I just stand there for okay I was gonna have a
[24766.84s -> 24786.42s]  podcast it's six o'clock right now I'm just gonna stand here until eight not

[24938.76s -> 24941.84s]  time I think it's time to sell everything and then just get the cool
[24941.84s -> 24947.16s]  drone and like who cares who needs a wife when you can have a super drone and

[25974.78s -> 26039.14s]  you know what I have better idea well this is sad this is a culmination of the
[26039.14s -> 26077.58s]  last full year of this guy's life had to call a tow truck I can't even destroy
[26077.58s -> 26108.73s]  their crops anymore fine I'm gonna go away I'll make my own world down here in
[26108.73s -> 26140.53s]  player solitude I'm gonna go live on the beach wait how is this player solitude
[26140.53s -> 26225.39s]  when somebody lives here this is the first spot that I came to I actually got
[26225.39s -> 26241.59s]  off on this beach I rode up thought I could just throw myself into the world
[26241.59s -> 26255.92s]  of farming like people do Hollywood a lot harder than that I thought it could
[26255.92s -> 26285.56s]  have been easy this is the spot slept a lot but you know I was tired four years
[26285.56s -> 26294.63s]  ago when I arrived here the boat was parked on this beach it looks like
[26294.63s -> 26301.20s]  somebody stole that from me it looks like there's an invisible wall that you
[26301.24s -> 26309.41s]  can't cross you know just like in life how many invisible walls do we have set
[26309.41s -> 26316.36s]  up for ourselves the world is teaching me something right now I'm being shown
[26316.36s -> 26364.18s]  something very important that I need to try this with a truck it's time to
[26364.18s -> 26394.27s]  break down those barriers social points some how many likes you can get on
[26394.27s -> 26397.77s]  Twitter how many that doesn't matter to me and once it doesn't matter it stops
[26398.37s -> 26417.19s]  as you see every mountain is hard to climb it's about getting over those
[26417.19s -> 26456.15s]  mountains if the water seems too deep call on a friend oh no friends no hold on
[26456.15s -> 26476.62s]  when friends come in all shapes and sizes it broke it I broke the drone and
[26476.62s -> 26502.34s]  my other friends dead I have to run to a gas station now damn it it's sometimes a
[26502.34s -> 26527.02s]  stranger the kindness of a stranger it's all it takes but our furry
[26527.02s -> 26556.04s]  companions are the true friends what a boring fucking animal stop I need to get
[26556.04s -> 26590.03s]  that I need to get I need to I need to sell something I need to sell something
[26590.03s -> 26602.05s]  does any does anybody here sell do you sell anything I good morning I need to
[26602.53s -> 26617.10s]  trade good oh my god okay there's a coffee shop over here is there a store
[26617.10s -> 26628.30s]  in town no I have nothing to sell are you sure about that sometimes our
[26628.30s -> 26636.14s]  material things need to be let go oh well you fucking just get an AI oil
[26636.14s -> 26647.10s]  change for God's sake I have 17 tomatoes and a $10,000 drone I don't need the
[26647.94s -> 26679.85s]  same fucking ice cream truck stream snipers they're coming for me get them
[26679.85s -> 26703.78s]  hi care to talk good morning care to trade that's not enough I need to yeah
[26703.78s -> 26708.98s]  walking into Starbucks and asking the barista behind the counter if they'd
[26708.98s -> 26715.87s]  like to buy a $4,500 drunk I think you're gonna probably want to sleep on that
[26715.87s -> 26731.01s]  one all right tow truck where's my truck and sometimes you get a call on a
[26731.01s -> 26786.30s]  friend to pull you out no mountain news do I but that spot one spot that one
[26786.30s -> 26830.16s]  little spot I don't know I'm trying to get I'm trying to add sounds to the game
[26830.16s -> 26838.78s]  cuz there are no sounds that spot that my grandfather brought me to all those
[26838.78s -> 26870.96s]  years ago it's one of my favorite things when it used to be a kid and
[26870.96s -> 26885.48s]  sometimes you got a call on a friend more than once where's the beach where's
[26885.48s -> 26907.83s]  the beach guys this video they're dropping cars out of the sky why are
[26907.83s -> 26917.49s]  they doing this there are the dropping cars are coming from the sky in frame it
[26917.49s -> 26932.82s]  doesn't make any sense all right can I get in here now
[26932.82s -> 26983.41s]  hey holy shit it broke okay I made it that this old truck since I was 17 I
[26983.41s -> 26988.86s]  first got my permit when even that grandfather drove this over in our boat
[26988.86s -> 27096.62s]  it's a long paddle and sometimes you call on a friend sometimes you have to
[27096.62s -> 27155.34s]  try to glitch into the wall like you do on the houses sometimes you need to call
[27155.34s -> 27161.75s]  on a friend not this time this time we do it on our own
[27161.75s -> 27197.84s]  push sometimes you got to give up sometimes you got to give up sometimes
[27197.84s -> 27201.80s]  you want to go get a large greasy ass pizza so you don't want to do this
[27201.80s -> 27265.94s]  anymore I'm going to bed sometimes you got to go to bed although interesting
[27265.94s -> 27270.76s]  sometimes you have to stick around because there's an invisible wall next
[27270.76s -> 27277.02s]  to me and an invisible wall in front of me we're not leaving yet I can't leave I
[27277.02s -> 27284.32s]  can only go this way I think I did get out into the invisible wall because this
[27284.32s -> 27290.53s]  is blocked and this is blocked let's see what happens I'm going over this
[27290.53s -> 27307.14s]  waterfall can I I wonder what happens here can I actually make it over is it
[27307.14s -> 27316.84s]  moving I can't tell if it's getting closer or not no I found the true end
[27316.84s -> 27335.39s]  this is the true end yep that's it we're just stuck in the water forever but
[27335.39s -> 27352.01s]  sometimes alright see you guys tomorrow we're gonna play sniper contracts
[27352.01s -> 27364.66s]  tomorrow who knows if it's gonna be any good it could be terrible but I'm
[27364.66s -> 27373.54s]  willing to give it a try oh no everything is broken can I even change
[27373.54s -> 27380.17s]  scenes in OBS from the time traveling thing when I went for two hours it just
[27380.17s -> 27394.09s]  fucked everything up I think I can do it manually through here let me see can

[27497.41s -> 27508.45s]  fixing it because I don't have an indicator how's that now it's too quiet

[28059.67s -> 28066.25s]  enjoyable a game doesn't have to be like nine out of ten on IGN to be an
[28066.25s -> 28071.82s]  enjoyable experience and you make your own fun sometimes that's more fun than
[28071.82s -> 28083.34s]  when you don't there's a good amount of water in here yeah he was about to say

[28103.06s -> 28110.26s]  drone in this game there's no camera on that drone you don't take pictures with
[28110.26s -> 28123.88s]  it why is it in the game just because that's just cool there's no farming

[28276.59s -> 28279.79s]  I'm kind of busy doing this oh I'm busy doing this I'm doing this I'm not gonna
[28279.79s -> 28282.43s]  be I'm gonna be gone for like two weeks so I'm gonna be gone for a week we've
[28282.43s -> 28284.07s]  been trying to play a video game for like a year and a half
[28284.07s -> 28304.34s]  sell him your drone he got busy and I got busy and then he got busy and I got
[28304.34s -> 28319.86s]  busy how do you hang out with friends these days it's impossible now we'll
[28319.86s -> 28326.83s]  play something it'll be fun it's been on the docket for like a year so well let
[28326.83s -> 28336.40s]  him up tonight see what he's doing you had over 4,000 people watching you try
[28336.40s -> 28346.31s]  to stack cars when you didn't say a word for five minutes it's crazy but I
[28346.31s -> 28358.82s]  failed I didn't do it that was the worst part I was trying and I failed I think
[28358.82s -> 28365.35s]  I've mentioned this a bunch of times before but if this was if this was
[28365.35s -> 28376.44s]  youtube.com slash German 985 from 2013 2014 I would have sat there every day
[28376.44s -> 28383.73s]  until I got that car on that roof even if it took 20 straight hours and it
[28383.73s -> 28395.73s]  would have been one clip in the video that would have been a total of about
[28395.73s -> 28402.80s]  eight seconds or nine seconds of time in the video but when you're on broadcast
[28402.80s -> 28407.85s]  and you're on a stream you got to move on sometimes you can't keep trying to
[28407.85s -> 28419.08s]  get the one thing you want yeah you know I'm willing to give it a shot so you're
[28419.08s -> 28423.36s]  saying is you don't care that much anymore no what I'm saying is if I turned
[28423.40s -> 28427.96s]  on my stream tomorrow and started moving a car with a drone with the same game
[28427.96s -> 28433.56s]  and that's what the stream was for seven straight hours and then I did that again
[28433.56s -> 28439.38s]  the next day I think I think people would be like I don't want to watch you
[28439.38s -> 28446.22s]  do this at all I don't want to see this and this is the you stream like three
[28446.22s -> 28449.04s]  sometimes four times a week this is what we're getting for the whole week and
[28449.04s -> 28454.42s]  then you're gonna take like a few days off okay well that was that was a cool
[28454.42s -> 28472.56s]  week of trying to get a car on a roof all right those aren't real fans it
[28472.56s -> 28477.34s]  sounds like a good stream to me they're almost it leaves there there are at
[28477.34s -> 28483.18s]  least two thousand insane fuckers here who would watch that I do realize that
[28483.18s -> 28492.44s]  um and those are hey and those are the fucking those are real ones yes the two
[28492.44s -> 28499.27s]  or three thousand of those there's 2200 people here right now you guys you guys
[28499.27s -> 28514.92s]  are the real ones the real ones no anybody that watches any portion of my
[28514.92s -> 28519.30s]  streams your thank you for doing that but if you're willing to watch me try to
[28519.30s -> 28530.84s]  flip a car with a drone for three days that's next level leavers I can't expect
[28530.84s -> 28535.59s]  anybody to like go sit there and watch that I'm just fucking around but thank
[28535.59s -> 28541.05s]  you for watching it don't worry it's fast forward to tomorrow when I try to
[28541.05s -> 28545.81s]  like snipe the same person for probably two straight hours and I mess it up
[28546.29s -> 28552.01s]  I can already see it happening don't worry I'll try to I'll try to flip a car
[28552.01s -> 28556.64s]  tomorrow okay I will flip it car if there's a flippable car tomorrow I
[28556.64s -> 28567.72s]  promise I will flip that car stream eat stream eating the deep dish pizza why
[28567.72s -> 28572.38s]  would you say I was gonna get a deep dish pizza I don't want I don't want
[28572.38s -> 28597.47s]  tomato paste in a pie tin did I just give a opinion on deep dish pizza you
[28597.47s -> 28604.05s]  sure did what's the last flavor of pie you've eaten banana cream pie and it is
[28604.05s -> 28611.52s]  the best it has absolutely no equal by the way let me give you a little bit
[28611.52s -> 28618.76s]  quick little like what fuck scenario why can't I find banana ice cream
[28618.76s -> 28629.74s]  anywhere I've tried everywhere I want banana ice cream not I the chunky monkey
[28629.74s -> 28632.78s]  is banana ice cream with a bunch of bullshit in it I don't want that I just
[28632.78s -> 28639.14s]  want banana ice cream no we have Ben and Jerry's has chunky monkey that's just
[28639.22s -> 28643.34s]  that's banana flavored ice cream with like walnuts and almonds and fucking
[28643.34s -> 28651.00s]  chocolate syrup and mm-hmm just banana ice cream it's hard to make it's
[28651.00s -> 28656.22s]  incredibly simple you just mash up bananas and blend it in with the ice
[28656.22s -> 28662.41s]  cream it's probably the easiest thing to possibly do then do it I don't have an
[28662.41s -> 28666.36s]  ice cream machine well I don't what I'm supposed to go buy an ice cream maker
[28666.36s -> 28670.28s]  then make my own banana ice cream that's actually a pretty good idea nice idea
[28670.32s -> 28679.26s]  good idea really good I'm gonna do that yeah cool I'm gonna get it I'm gonna get
[28679.26s -> 28686.99s]  an ice cream machine and I'm gonna make banana ice cream I'll make it better but
[28686.99s -> 28692.75s]  yeah banana cream pie is the best banana cream pie is better than chocolate
[28692.75s -> 28697.52s]  cream pie I think because chocolate cream pie is just fudge with whipped cream
[28697.52s -> 28710.40s]  on it let's be honest as banana creams way better it's just it's just mousse
[28710.40s -> 28714.88s]  it's just chocolate mousse with whipped cream all over it that's not I don't
[28714.88s -> 28727.09s]  think that's as special but German banana cream pie is just banana custard
[28727.09s -> 28733.87s]  with cream on it stop stop it don't get out of here get out of my room get out
[28733.87s -> 28744.92s]  of my room I'm just trying to get out of my fucking room all right Jesus some
[28744.92s -> 28751.28s]  people just come in and they just talk shit to me would you eat Dorito ice
[28751.28s -> 28756.44s]  cream no that's just I don't like to put bacon on my ice cream either people
[28756.44s -> 28765.41s]  look at put big look at a big bacon ice cream no I don't know that's too much
[28765.41s -> 28778.82s]  for me would you eat chocolate dough yes I would eat chocolate ice cream I love
[28778.86s -> 28788.49s]  chocolate ice cream cool rank ice cream flavors strawberry smooth without any
[28788.49s -> 28794.31s]  strawberry bits or pieces in it just strawberry flavored ice cream and I know
[28794.31s -> 28798.43s]  yeah oh he's a serial killer serial killer he's he's a serious killing he's
[28798.43s -> 28804.72s]  a serial killer no not sherbert just strawberry flavored ice cream plain plain
[28804.72s -> 28816.16s]  banana ice cream plain chocolate ice cream plain he sees case case killing
[28816.16s -> 28819.00s]  people and eating them he's eating he probably eats people I know I know what
[28819.00s -> 28825.52s]  you're saying I but I really do believe that straight-up just flavored strawberry
[28825.52s -> 28840.30s]  smooth ice cream is the best no no tearless no I know maybe tomorrow
[28840.30s -> 28845.01s]  well get it get me some good tearless maybe we'll do them tomorrow cuz sniper
[28845.01s -> 28850.27s]  contracts is gonna last like 38 minutes I'm gonna play it for like an hour and
[28850.27s -> 28853.87s]  I'm gonna be like this game's stupid and then we'll I already bought it so I'm
[28853.87s -> 28859.20s]  not gonna this is what we're doing I'm going in with low expectations so if the
[28859.20s -> 28869.65s]  game's actually good then we'll play the whole thing but let's finish up the bits
[28869.65s -> 28874.41s]  thank you stardust flair for the 300 bits thanks Jermis so many laughs tonight
[28874.41s -> 28880.70s]  and an amazing stream thank you glad you had a good time I did too
[28880.70s -> 28885.96s]  flug boy thanks for the 250 nearing the end of death stranding it's definitely my
[28885.96s -> 28890.44s]  game of the year it's not for everyone but it's a Kojima game for sure not
[28890.44s -> 28896.76s]  sure if you got your hands on it I have not I'm probably not going to play it
[28896.76s -> 28903.64s]  anytime soon because I heard it is it's something it's like a 50 hour game to
[28903.64s -> 28908.26s]  get to the end if you're like a 40 to 60 hour game that is that correct I don't
[28908.26s -> 28916.66s]  think I I'm not sure I'm ready to commit like 50 plus hours to a game at the
[28916.66s -> 28921.43s]  moment unless it was on stream because for the most part when I play video
[28921.43s -> 28925.88s]  games I play them on stream it's just kind of when I game at this point is I
[28926.40s -> 28932.27s]  do some stuff off stream and played God of War a little bit but 40 is standard
[28932.27s -> 28946.70s]  yeah it looks cool that's just something I don't think I would stream if it's a
[28946.70s -> 28952.09s]  game of the year that's good hey better late than never right we are almost at
[28952.09s -> 28963.05s]  the end of November game of the year but they say also that new Star Wars game
[28963.05s -> 28968.66s]  I'm hearing is very secure Oh like you should check it out you guys gotta help
[28968.66s -> 28977.42s]  me out on this one cuz I it's every time that new Star Wars game comes up
[28977.42s -> 28984.18s]  it's like don't play that shitty game it's boring and sucks and like the
[28984.18s -> 28989.83s]  middle five to ten hours of that game is dogshit and then another group of
[28989.83s -> 28994.59s]  people say it's so it's great it's so good you're gonna love it it's like fuck
[28994.59s -> 29003.48s]  this like it's like so split what I've been told is that it's fun like as a
[29003.48s -> 29007.64s]  complete package it's a fun game but there's like an unbearable like string
[29007.64s -> 29024.30s]  of five to six hours in the game that are just like this game's stupid you
[29024.30s -> 29031.58s]  played farmers dynasty but you can't compare you call on you cannot compare
[29031.58s -> 29038.80s]  the farmers dynasty stream to if I'm going to actually sit down and play Star
[29038.80s -> 29044.32s]  Wars the fallen order game that's like there's two different things going on
[29044.32s -> 29053.02s]  there I'm not going when I opened up farmers dynasty we would you know that's
[29053.02s -> 29060.52s]  the same mindset going and playing Star Wars on hard you played this for eight
[29060.52s -> 29066.21s]  hours yeah but I'm not gonna play this tomorrow for eight hours if I play Star
[29066.21s -> 29070.17s]  Wars tomorrow for eight hours I'm gonna play Star Wars again for eight hours the
[29070.17s -> 29084.15s]  next day we'll be flipping cars here yes you will you promised a roof car so I
[29084.15s -> 29087.95s]  can't I can't play Star Wars tomorrow then because there's a I can't put a car
[29087.99s -> 29094.22s]  on a roof how am I gonna put a car on a roof in a sniper game he's no I'm not
[29094.22s -> 29100.38s]  gonna play this again let me get some more opinions on the Star Wars game and
[29100.38s -> 29104.83s]  then I'll just probably just in a plane the damn thing there's you know what I'm
[29104.83s -> 29107.91s]  probably gonna play Outer Worlds I'm gonna play Star Wars game the reason why
[29107.91s -> 29114.80s]  I'm gonna say all this is because we're about to hit that point after holiday you
[29114.80s -> 29119.04s]  know from November into December there's gonna be like two or three months
[29119.04s -> 29128.54s]  straight with nothing releases so we'll get a bunch of good stuff now alright

[29466.98s -> 29469.06s]  guys what okay what's a triple-a game to you guys
[29469.06s -> 29480.66s]  triple-a means high production value that's it it means it's $60 and it was
[29480.66s -> 29493.26s]  made by a bunch of people high budget okay all right so you got Metro Exodus
[29493.26s -> 29498.65s]  Kingdom Hearts 3 I'm not gonna play that game why would I Resident Evil 2 which
[29498.65s -> 29507.91s]  was fantastic okay apex legends not gonna why would I play that far cry new

[29514.15s -> 29520.53s]  rage to nope any of these ringing a bell for his games that you desperately
[29520.53s -> 29534.94s]  want me to want to see me play so then if I don't if I don't haven't played

[29538.02s -> 29548.15s]  the division to we need more division to on this stream devil may cry five fuck
[29548.19s -> 29558.79s]  that's one that's one that you got me you got me there yeah you got me that's
[29558.79s -> 29563.98s]  that that's one that I really would have played and I should have played but all
[29563.98s -> 29568.97s]  right so and then secure Oh and then Mortal Kombat 11 is on here too but I
[29568.97s -> 29572.89s]  mean Mortal Kombat is a really really cool thing but I it's a fighting game
[29572.89s -> 29582.26s]  I'm not I don't really invest time into them but as of all these ones on this
[29582.26s -> 29586.91s]  list I played the good ones Resident Evil 2 that's a good one
[29586.99s -> 29594.55s]  Sekiro that's one of the good ones devil may cry five is the only one on this
[29594.55s -> 29597.87s]  list I think that I haven't played that is like one of those single-player
[29597.87s -> 29604.13s]  experiences put it on the list we'll do it the Witcher 3 came out like four
[29604.13s -> 29610.58s]  years ago smash ultimate I played smash ultimate but I didn't stream it
[29610.58s -> 29626.67s]  triple-a pronounced and sometimes written triple-a is an informal
[29626.67s -> 29629.79s]  classification used for video games produced and distributed by a mid-sized
[29629.79s -> 29644.07s]  or a major publisher informal informal now I'm not against playing triple-a
[29644.07s -> 29651.62s]  games but I just I need to be into them that's crackdown 3 is technically a
[29651.62s -> 29663.42s]  triple-a game and I'm not gonna play that I to be completely and totally fair
[29663.42s -> 29670.83s]  though Metro Exodus and devil may cry are the other two that I have not played
[29670.83s -> 29678.84s]  this year but the reason why I didn't play Metro Exodus is cuz I had a melt
[29678.84s -> 29684.02s]  down during last light I played it for like 30 minutes and I died like ten
[29684.06s -> 29687.34s]  times on my hardest difficulty and I like had a fucking meltdown and I quit
[29687.34s -> 29691.10s]  the game forever so like I can't I can't just skip that game because I can't go
[29691.10s -> 29697.85s]  back to that game I've tried I thought about it I did the Metro 2033 and it was
[29697.85s -> 29702.13s]  really good it was awesome and then I played last night I had a head of full
[29702.13s -> 29707.67s]  on like I can't do this meltdown I just couldn't do I could not play the game I
[29707.67s -> 29710.47s]  don't know why it was something's going on I've put the difficulty in the wrong
[29710.47s -> 29723.12s]  place and I've rage quit it what about salmon max that's not triple-a you do
[29723.16s -> 29730.05s]  that a lot I do not do that a lot when was the last time I've rage quit a game
[29730.05s -> 29736.13s]  in 30 minutes and never played it again it was last light that was the last time
[29736.13s -> 29743.72s]  I did that you know how I know that because I remember it every damn day Neo
[29743.72s -> 29750.79s]  yes that did happen with Neo 2 but that was both way before last light hotline
[29750.79s -> 29754.23s]  Miami I beat hotline Miami and hotline Miami 2 we talked about tougher like
[29754.23s -> 29758.03s]  right when was the last time I rate I rate yeah I've raged in hotline Miami 2
[29758.03s -> 29777.09s]  but I stuck with it and beat the game he checks out that I know I know I do
[29777.09s -> 29787.66s]  even played rage shadow legends I don't even know what that is hey so Sretto
[29787.66s -> 29792.34s]  thanks for the four dollars and 20 cents hello beauty hello beauty lady
[29792.34s -> 29801.87s]  remember the stream that would would have been funny we were talking to the
[29801.87s -> 29804.95s]  pre stream chat or I think it was maybe even the recommended on discord
[29804.95s -> 29810.82s]  somebody said just to open up my iPad open up a like the first YouTube video
[29810.82s -> 29813.90s]  like I just open up as many YouTube videos as I can try to get ads and
[29813.90s -> 29818.38s]  click on every ad for every mobile game that's an advertisement and play them
[29818.38s -> 29827.61s]  download every ad game just go find them just open up any gaming website and just
[29827.61s -> 29835.96s]  go click on every one of those ads and download those stupid banner ads but
[29835.96s -> 29839.20s]  then I thought it's probably a really bad idea that's like a really easy way
[29839.20s -> 29858.93s]  to get just like on like a never-ending sucker list do it on a VM get an Emmy
[29858.97s -> 29864.81s]  letter specifically for virus streams just emulate windows for like the
[29864.81s -> 29876.05s]  specific virus mobile ad games we'll see it was a funny idea is there an update
[29876.05s -> 29880.93s]  on the Sultan stream not yet the fuck the king server stuff is still being
[29880.93s -> 29885.25s]  worked on which actually I can talk about this just a little bit before we
[29885.25s -> 29891.03s]  go this is going to be and I've seen a lot of questions about this this is
[29891.03s -> 29895.65s]  going to be because it has to and I really wish there was another way but I
[29895.65s -> 29901.61s]  really don't think there is this has to be sub only not only does it have to be
[29901.61s -> 29906.67s]  sub only but it might have to be multiple month sub only to join this
[29906.67s -> 29915.50s]  server for a few different reasons the unfortunate truth of the game like
[29915.50s -> 29925.09s]  Minecraft is somebody could just open up a script and just go in the server and
[29925.93s -> 29932.94s]  I have to be I have to lock it down where there's probably gonna be a
[29932.94s -> 29940.66s]  whitelisting phase before like a week or two before the stream and I'm probably
[29940.66s -> 29947.82s]  gonna have to do not just a one month concurrent sub because then what think
[29947.82s -> 29952.54s]  about that scenario oh okay well it's sub only I can get in that server all
[29952.54s -> 29956.26s]  right let me just I'll just pay five dollars and then jump in and fucking
[29956.26s -> 29965.16s]  destroy everybody so it's gonna have to be locked down we I've been trying to
[29965.16s -> 29975.19s]  talk back and forth with people that are working on it but we don't have a final
[29975.19s -> 29981.90s]  a final game plan I guess yet but it's absolutely gonna be sub only and
[29981.90s -> 29994.97s]  multi-month probably so and hopefully we can get enough of you in there tier
[29994.97s -> 30003.18s]  three subs only I'm not doing that I think as long as it's you've been subbed
[30003.18s -> 30008.03s]  for a full month like you're on your second month that's probably enough
[30008.19s -> 30012.43s]  because that means that people can't just sub now and in like two or three
[30012.43s -> 30015.11s]  four weeks when this is probably not gonna be happening for at least a few
[30015.11s -> 30021.20s]  weeks but I just don't want somebody to be able to sub like right now and we'll
[30021.20s -> 30025.42s]  have to find out it might be three I don't know we're also trying to get in
[30025.42s -> 30031.75s]  touch with some people that like code in Minecraft and some anti-cheat people and
[30031.75s -> 30038.26s]  I want to make this really work so I'm trying to put in I'm trying to put my
[30038.26s -> 30044.78s]  thumb in all the holes that are in the wall that's why I have kind of just said
[30044.78s -> 30047.30s]  hey I'm thinking about doing it and I want to do it and it's gonna happen but
[30047.30s -> 30053.26s]  I'm not talking about it in the last few days but there's an update on that I
[30053.26s -> 30061.38s]  know I've seen a lot of questions about is that specifically we'll see but we
[30061.38s -> 30069.82s]  have a two more bits to do thank you Malto for the 500 bits hey I'm
[30069.82s -> 30076.85s]  struggling with the acne can you recommend me a good dermatologist
