[5.37s -> 16.50s]  What are you guys doing? What is this? Stop writing that. Don't write that. What's wrong with you?
[19.06s -> 29.16s]  What is this? I don't get it. It's a it's a penis curse. I don't know what that means.
[29.80s -> 45.10s]  He doesn't know. No, I don't at all. I have no idea what you're doing. There's a lot of- wait,
[45.10s -> 59.56s]  is this a chant? Are you chanting? Yeah, twitch added copy to clipboard. You're chanting. You know
[59.56s -> 66.63s]  for the time that shit goes by too fast, you can't copy it and spam it fast enough. In comes
[66.63s -> 76.76s]  chanting. Making your life as a twitch viewer that much more simple. Uh, let me tweet this. I'll be
[76.76s -> 149.46s]  right back. Okay. Hello. How are you? Today we're gonna play Fable 2, or at least start it and
[149.46s -> 158.36s]  play it for a little while. I think Fable 2 is like 12 to 16 hours. We'll see how far we get in two
[158.36s -> 167.56s]  days. I don't know. I don't know. We might go halfway Andy and I might just get to like 60%
[167.56s -> 175.58s]  of the way through the game and be like, nah, that was fun. You forgot the gif. You guys have
[175.58s -> 179.74s]  to understand, I've said this a bunch of times, but it's very very accurate. I need to make it
[179.74s -> 187.00s]  very clear. From the beginning of last stream to the end of last stream, I remembered that stuff
[187.80s -> 194.71s]  like an hour after that stream finished. Today, from the beginning of this stream, I don't have
[194.71s -> 201.13s]  any memory of almost anything that happened on the last stream. We're in a new period here.
[202.23s -> 205.19s]  I'll remember this shit for like the next probably few hours after the stream's over,
[205.19s -> 217.78s]  maybe tomorrow morning. I don't, there's too much for me to remember. What stream? The one
[217.78s -> 223.99s]  from last week. I know I played Resident Evil 8. I know I did like a Wile E. Coyote routine with
[223.99s -> 234.12s]  one of the werewolves. I remember the big lady. I remember like screaming a bunch of times. That's
[234.12s -> 240.55s]  it. That's pretty much it. I don't know anything else. I remember none of that happened. None of
[240.55s -> 249.69s]  us are real. There is something I do have to tell you, which I'm not necessarily happy with, but
[250.73s -> 258.58s]  next weekend on Sunday, I have somebody that has been blowing my phone up and
[259.38s -> 268.97s]  I have a contractual obligation kind of to let them stream. Let me just give it to you long and
[268.97s -> 277.88s]  short. They were pissed off that they weren't involved in a stream from last year and I get
[277.88s -> 285.34s]  texts from this person every like six days. Hey, is it cool? Can I do like my routine? I'm like,
[288.22s -> 293.42s]  no. I don't fucking want you. Look, you weren't there and the stream didn't happen, so I can't.
[294.14s -> 298.31s]  This person just fucking won't leave me alone, so I'm going to give them the opportunity to do a
[298.31s -> 303.19s]  routine for you, okay? That's next weekend. I don't have any idea what the fuck they're going
[303.19s -> 309.51s]  to do, but that's Sunday. I don't know if I wouldn't miss it if I were you. Maybe I would.
[310.07s -> 315.40s]  Depends on who you are. Depends on how you like anybody. Depends on how much you like somebody.
[317.98s -> 321.82s]  I don't know. They're going to have control and that's it. That's all you need to know. Sunday.
[322.38s -> 327.26s]  Either on Sunday. Next Sunday. Stream is on Sunday. Next Sunday. Be there. Or don't.
[330.44s -> 341.83s]  Ugh. Zero viewers. I don't, I have no idea. I don't want to tell you who it is.
[343.21s -> 348.25s]  Rather you just get surprised or not. But now we're going to play Fable 2. Probably play Fable
[348.25s -> 356.14s]  tomorrow. I'm going to do a two-day in a row of streams. You should stream at the same time.
[356.86s -> 369.50s]  I can't because they were supposed to be on my stream, so I can't do that. What if Fable sucks?
[370.46s -> 374.86s]  You know, if Fable sucks. I know. I played this game before. I played Fable 2.
[375.66s -> 382.42s]  I know what I'm getting into. Fable 2. Let me just make sure everything works.
[383.54s -> 386.74s]  I think this should be fine. This game was a lot of fun from what I remember.
[389.58s -> 395.26s]  I can't hear anything. Oh, there we go. Okay. I got to turn the volume up on my monitor.
[396.07s -> 411.96s]  It is far too low. There we go. Do we have any potions or food? That's good. So I'm going to try.
[412.04s -> 419.24s]  I know that you look like the streamer thing to do in these games is to get a hundred percent evil
[419.24s -> 426.54s]  points. I'm going to try to be a very good boy. I'm not going to like kill anybody. I'm not going
[426.54s -> 432.10s]  to hurt anybody. I'm not going to like kick any chickens and stuff and get yelled at. I'm going
[432.10s -> 439.22s]  to be a very extra good boy. I'm already seeing Resident Sleepers, but everybody does. Everybody
[439.22s -> 444.74s]  is evil. Everybody is like, oh, look at me. I'm evil. I have horns. I'm so bad. I'm evil.
[444.74s -> 449.19s]  I don't want to be evil. I want to be a good person. Don't Resident Sleeper that.
[449.19s -> 458.62s]  But who is the hero of our tale? I want to be a good boy. You're not going to be able to resist.
[458.62s -> 464.10s]  I'm going to try to be a good boy. I didn't say I was. Then let his destiny unfold.
[464.10s -> 470.15s]  Oh shit. I remember this part. You remember when I was like a kid, didn't they do the thing?
[470.15s -> 475.85s]  This is like Link grows up into like big Link, right? So many people tried to copy that shit
[475.85s -> 478.97s]  after they did that. Remember that? Remember Ocarina of Time? It was like, look, you play as
[478.97s -> 486.95s]  Link and then like your adult Link. Everybody desperately tried to do that too. All miserable
[486.95s -> 506.25s]  failures, by the way. This dude is ugly. Fucking 10 year old. What are you talking about? What?
[506.81s -> 523.16s]  He was talking about you. I'm not even on camera. This is Hogwarts. This is Harry Potter. This is
[523.16s -> 530.62s]  Hogwarts. The same intro happens. Wait, what? It is, right? The exact same thing happens.
[540.60s -> 545.00s]  Nice graphics. This game is on Xbox 360. Oh, I have to test to make sure there's no delay.
[545.64s -> 556.84s]  This bird poop is going to land on my head, right? Someone's going to lean in and go,
[556.84s -> 561.56s]  here's a chicken chisel. Bird pooped on chicken chisel's head.
[561.56s -> 573.56s]  I hear that's lucky, like finding a four leaf clover.
[573.56s -> 582.50s]  Why is there snow floating around? Is this snow or is this like fucking ash? Use LT to focus on
[582.50s -> 593.46s]  important events. It's a volcanic winter. I bet Lord Lucian's having roast duck this time of year,
[594.26s -> 597.83s]  but he must be really lonely since his wife and his little girl died
[598.63s -> 616.63s]  in that big castle all by himself. I don't even live in there. Oh, the town party. Follow the
[616.63s -> 626.90s]  glowing trail. Oh yeah, I forgot they did. Oh my God, this is ugly. This is really ugly. I forgot
[626.90s -> 639.88s]  like 360 looks like shit. That's rude. Follow the glowing trail to your next objective.
[648.07s -> 650.31s]  I don't remember it looking like this. Do I just?
[650.39s -> 668.22s]  I remember this. I say this on stream all the time.
[671.18s -> 679.70s]  I say this all the time. Yes, I do.
[686.30s -> 687.59s]  I've never said it. Yes, I have.
[692.66s -> 698.14s]  Unassuming box is actually a device created by the ancients.
[703.66s -> 706.06s]  Why would I even know that I said that if I didn't say it?
[710.94s -> 714.86s]  There's no such thing as magic. I feel like these
[715.90s -> 720.46s]  look like electrified. We live in grim times indeed. If the young are too world weary to
[720.46s -> 727.74s]  believe in magic, most children your age believe eagerly. I can see your eyes too much
[727.74s -> 736.26s]  fucking lit up snow. That's what the seller thinks. He has no idea what he stumbled upon,
[736.26s -> 740.89s]  but you have an inkling, don't you? Some part of you wants to believe it.
[740.89s -> 744.49s]  Why does the snowflakes have bloom on them? That seems so bizarre.
[744.49s -> 749.90s]  You really think it could be this looks like fucking radioactive.
[749.90s -> 759.11s]  You could have your answer. Listen to me, Rose. At the end of that week,
[759.11s -> 763.51s]  you and your little sparrow would be no closer to your dream, no closer to the inside of that
[763.51s -> 767.37s]  beautiful castle. We need five gold pieces.
[768.17s -> 773.75s]  I bet we could get five gold pieces, and maybe this could be a way out of here after all.
[773.75s -> 778.79s]  How does it look for you guys? It looks terrible for me. It looks awful. I'm looking at the OBS
[778.79s -> 787.53s]  monitor. It looks better through the OBS monitor than it does on my screen. It actually looks
[787.53s -> 796.14s]  better on the preview monitor. Okay, I need five gold pieces. This is to teach you the morality,
[796.14s -> 813.62s]  right? Okay. It doesn't look too bad. All right, earn gold by finding the arrest
[813.62s -> 820.30s]  warrants for Albion's most ruthless criminals. This is reminding me how much I hate this game.
[820.62s -> 828.44s]  Okay. Nobody hates this game. They hate the guy that made this game. This game is actually fun,
[829.88s -> 848.25s]  kind of. All right, let's go get them. All right, let's go. So we're looking for warrants. No,
[848.25s -> 860.76s]  it's because of the snow. This is fine. I'll get used to this. Oh, thank God there's an imbecile
[860.76s -> 875.62s]  trail. All right, let's go. How about Barnum by posing for a picture for one gold piece?
[883.38s -> 884.98s]  Blur is disgusting.
[885.54s -> 911.94s]  How come this is not PC? That's kind of weird. Beer goggles? How do I pose? I just farted. I
[911.94s -> 925.19s]  didn't want to do that. I was supposed to be a good boy. Okay, well, I'm already a bad boy.
[931.51s -> 937.19s]  Already evil? No, not yet. Farting isn't evil. It's a natural part of your body's ecosystem.
[939.58s -> 945.30s]  Imagine thinking farting is evil. All right, we gotta find warrants.
[946.42s -> 961.13s]  This guy might have a warrant. Oh, what? Why is he glowing? Oh, friendly villager. Okay. Can I go
[961.13s -> 968.58s]  out here? I'm gonna turn the game on. No, okay. Once the snow is gone, everyone will be like,
[969.06s -> 974.84s]  this is fine. All right, what about this way? That guy who did that. Oh, thank God for the
[974.84s -> 994.97s]  imbecile leader. What happened? Hey, don't do that. All right, let's kick his ass. Hey,
[996.81s -> 1000.73s]  my God, she just dropped. She's like unconscious. I don't remember this part of the game.
[1000.81s -> 1033.70s]  All right, so where's the money? Oh, wait, that was for free. All right,
[1033.70s -> 1037.56s]  we're good people. We're just a good boy for free. What about the dog? Is the dog okay?
[1038.28s -> 1051.27s]  How do we help the dog? Oh, yeah. You get a dog, don't you?
[1055.27s -> 1058.39s]  We don't have enough food for ourselves. I remember this part of the game. This is like
[1058.39s -> 1064.71s]  the best part of the whole game was that they're very realistic dog. I remember,
[1064.71s -> 1070.30s]  didn't Peter Molyneux make a huge deal about this? It was like the dog who spent 6,000 days
[1070.30s -> 1085.66s]  animating the dog. Oh, I got good boy points there. I don't want bad boy points. Oh, here we go.
[1087.86s -> 1096.65s]  The dog. All right, what does this do? Clear Balthazar's warehouse of beetles or smashers
[1096.65s -> 1102.31s]  stock. What do you mean smash? I can smash his stuff?
[1112.39s -> 1131.27s]  All right, so don't break anything. Sir, you are going to have to go through the proper authorities.
[1134.22s -> 1144.01s]  I am not going to do that. Certified good boy Jeremy Albertson. All right, where are the bugs?
[1144.01s -> 1163.50s]  Why does this kid have a... That's boring. Holy shit. Smash. No. How am I supposed to be certified
[1163.50s -> 1170.07s]  good boy Jeremy Albertson if I'm... No, I'm not going to break anything. Don't you understand?
[1170.07s -> 1174.47s]  We have to have something event happen in our life to create us our origin story to be the villain.
[1175.91s -> 1181.70s]  The Joker wasn't the fucking Joker when he was like 8. He was a good boy.
[1185.62s -> 1191.94s]  That was a massacre. No mercy for the filthy buggers. That's what I like to see.
[1194.87s -> 1202.95s]  You weren't supposed to kill them. Now I think about it. I wonder how those beetles got in there.
[1202.95s -> 1206.63s]  Yes, he was. I watched the cartoon. What did you say? Did you say the cartoon?
[1206.63s -> 1212.86s]  I didn't know you were so good at fighting. We're really doing it.
[1214.95s -> 1217.75s]  Here we go. More decision making. I need two drinks.
[1218.47s -> 1226.68s]  Cover the stolen bottle. Where are the warrants? So you'll bring me back my bottle? Yes.
[1230.34s -> 1236.98s]  You'll find it and bring it to me, won't you children? Oh, okay. So we have to bring the
[1236.98s -> 1244.79s]  bottle and bring it to this lady because we're a good boy. Oh, hi dog. What'd you find? A warrant.
[1247.29s -> 1257.10s]  Nice. Nice find. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, I know. You're sweet. No, I'm the good boy.
[1257.10s -> 1265.18s]  But I told you before. We can't keep you. Come on, little sparrow. What did we find?
[1270.38s -> 1285.51s]  The warrant! Any Carmen Sandiego fans here? I guess not.
[1295.94s -> 1302.66s]  All right, more warrants. That's why. No, put the gun down. No, put the sword down and put the gun
[1302.66s -> 1312.66s]  down. Put the gun away. Oh my God, my face. Put it down. No, how do I just put it away?
[1324.81s -> 1338.28s]  Don't wake him up. How do I sneak? How do I sneak? There is no sneak.
[1338.28s -> 1348.46s]  Run. All right, return the wine to Pete. All right, we're going to return it to Betty.
[1354.09s -> 1359.77s]  We're a good boy. Hard on them. Fine. I'm a good boy, but I do bad things.
[1367.34s -> 1367.90s]  Is that possible?
[1373.19s -> 1373.67s]  Wait, what?
[1386.65s -> 1390.01s]  So we both we get a gold piece no matter what. So let's just do the good thing.
[1392.95s -> 1405.06s]  Yeah, I'm good. Take it. I think you guys are misunderstanding this.
[1405.14s -> 1412.01s]  We need to build up a hundred good boy points. Do good things. So then when I lose a hundred
[1412.01s -> 1418.09s]  points for drop kicking somebody through a window, I'm fine. I'm still normal. Did you get it?
[1427.86s -> 1434.87s]  All right, we got three gold pieces. Three gold pieces. All right, I think there's more warrants
[1434.87s -> 1445.70s]  up here. Wait, what does it say? Read? Brookridge. You know what's really important, too? We have to
[1445.70s -> 1451.22s]  decide. I'm gonna have to do a poll. Because we have to pick, right? Like melee, ranged,
[1451.22s -> 1464.42s]  or magic. Melee, ranged, or magic. It's a big decision. Magic, magic, magic, magic.
[1465.14s -> 1475.10s]  Range, range, range, ranged. Let's go back to the guard. Melee, melee, melee, melee, melee. Hey,
[1475.10s -> 1485.80s]  kids. Oh, cool. A fart party. Why can I do it? How come I can't do it? I could show all these
[1485.80s -> 1491.37s]  kids like who's the best, the biggest farts. All right, I'm leaving. How come I can't do it?
[1496.22s -> 1511.85s]  Uh-oh. Stop right there. Shut it, girl. This isn't about that. Those warrants you're collecting.
[1512.73s -> 1520.01s]  Oh, really? So does our friend the guard. Yeah, but you're gonna give them to me. See?
[1520.01s -> 1525.45s]  I'm just gonna pop this guy. Otherwise, there'll be trouble. There'll be trouble, all right?
[1525.45s -> 1528.33s]  You take these, and I'll tell our friend what you really want.
[1529.45s -> 1534.38s]  All right, you little hard case. What's he paying you? A gold piece?
[1535.34s -> 1542.74s]  Well, yeah, a nice premium you're paying me. One gold piece? You pay me a three gold piece premium
[1542.74s -> 1550.36s]  to even consider this shit. Get the fuck out of here. Did you not understand crime? Like,
[1550.36s -> 1553.80s]  you don't understand how this works? I would have considered it for three or four gold pieces.
[1553.80s -> 1556.04s]  You're gonna give me the same that I would get for bringing it to the guard?
[1557.19s -> 1559.91s]  Do you even understand fucking crime? My empire begins now.
[1559.91s -> 1570.78s]  Thanks. I've savored. Now, normally, justice is its own reward. But as these aren't normal
[1570.78s -> 1576.62s]  circumstances, there's your gold piece. Okay, I need one more. Let's pick my nose.
[1576.62s -> 1582.09s]  That just sold out this town. You just need one more.
[1582.09s -> 1587.14s]  What is this? What are we doing here? I think mother heard us.
[1587.14s -> 1599.06s]  He's an evil good boy. I- unlike the- unlike the spectrum of good, bad, like, evil, does evil
[1599.06s -> 1603.78s]  things, does good things. I just want us to be just orbiting around in a circle,
[1603.78s -> 1624.70s]  around that whole spectrum. Magic? 71% magic. What the fuck? Speak to Monty.
[1624.70s -> 1628.38s]  Are you an anti-hero or an anti-villain? Yes.
[1644.30s -> 1647.54s]  Why'd you ask me then? Maybe we could help you.
[1648.10s -> 1652.02s]  Hyperactive good boy with villainous tendencies. Where's that one?
[1652.02s -> 1655.22s]  You can take my proposal letter to the fair maiden. Oh, there is hope.
[1655.22s -> 1656.50s]  My heart soars in my chest like- Oh, you know who it would be?
[1657.54s -> 1660.42s]  I would be Loki from Marvel. That's who I want to be.
[1660.42s -> 1667.10s]  We'll do it for a gold piece. Oh, I'm a bit strapped right at the moment.
[1668.49s -> 1672.89s]  But Belinda's good for it. I'm sure she'll pay you when she receives my letter.
[1674.62s -> 1677.18s]  All right, deliver the letter to Monty's beloved. Let's do it.
[1677.82s -> 1686.97s]  Give us the money. Don't let her mom get it.
[1686.97s -> 1689.37s]  Oh, wait. Okay, so let's just give it right to the mom?
[1689.93s -> 1694.22s]  What's the good thing to do here? Deliver it to mom.
[1694.22s -> 1701.67s]  Just say, hey, there's this guy outside. Is that James Corden?
[1704.01s -> 1708.87s]  I don't know. I didn't know who that was until I had to think about it for a second.
[1709.43s -> 1712.15s]  And thinking about it for more than two seconds, I just saw in my brain
[1713.35s -> 1719.11s]  a profile shot of him in a car bouncing around singing a song with his hands on the wheel.
[1719.11s -> 1721.19s]  And then, oh, okay, now I know who the fuck that is.
[1723.99s -> 1734.28s]  What do you want? We've got a letter. We need one gold for the postage.
[1735.16s -> 1736.92s]  Kath, there's more than one British person.
[1742.71s -> 1745.27s]  There is more than one British person on Earth. Yes.
[1745.75s -> 1750.68s]  Don't you touch anything.
[1750.68s -> 1753.88s]  Okay, I'm a good person that does bad things sometimes, right?
[1754.60s -> 1758.71s]  Monty told us not to give it to the mother. But she'll pay us if we just wait here.
[1759.67s -> 1763.67s]  But then if we give it to Belinda upstairs, maybe they can run away together.
[1763.67s -> 1768.22s]  What's the good thing? I don't know what's good. What's easiest?
[1768.22s -> 1772.94s]  I don't know. You put these things somewhere so no one can find them and then you can't find them.
[1772.94s -> 1777.50s]  Letting the mother have it would be easiest.
[1779.66s -> 1782.86s]  Look, I have a letter for you, but it's going to require one specific thing.
[1782.86s -> 1790.79s]  I'm going to need one gold coin and two of your finest pieces of jewelry you have in the house.
[1791.35s -> 1792.71s]  This is how crime works, okay?
[1793.43s -> 1794.71s]  Do I need to explain it to you?
[1806.06s -> 1807.26s]  Shouldn't I be in school?
[1807.26s -> 1808.78s]  I don't know. Was there school back in like...
[1811.02s -> 1815.58s]  In like the 1500s? Did kids go to school in like the 1400s?
[1817.98s -> 1818.78s]  I don't think so.
[1825.22s -> 1828.02s]  No. When did... Okay, when was the first school?
[1828.02s -> 1832.12s]  Oh, I'm missing like the important stuff. Hold on. Watch out.
[1845.14s -> 1845.86s]  Oh wait, I can...
[1850.12s -> 1853.14s]  Rude. Point and laugh.
[1860.10s -> 1864.94s]  Social. Okay. Thumbs up.
[1869.82s -> 1870.46s]  Oh, look at me.
[1871.10s -> 1872.78s]  Maybe you should marry her instead.
[1873.58s -> 1874.66s]  What am I doing?
[1888.63s -> 1895.11s]  What was that? What is scary? Bloodlust?
[1899.11s -> 1901.27s]  Where did this kid come from? Why is there a kid in here?
[1901.99s -> 1904.15s]  No, I'm good. I just do bad things.
[1909.35s -> 1910.71s]  I'm scaring this kid.
[1911.91s -> 1915.99s]  That really is awful.
[1916.63s -> 1919.40s]  All right, get out, get out, get out, get out. Time to leave, leave, leave.
[1920.04s -> 1929.32s]  I was just trying to scare a kid. Art on the kid. No.
[1935.05s -> 1936.57s]  All right, let's buy the music box.
[1949.88s -> 1950.38s]  Okay.
[1954.68s -> 1957.96s]  24th and 23rd century BC established the first school. Okay.
[1968.34s -> 1969.78s]  Why when getting an item in the description?
[1969.78s -> 1971.70s]  Oh, a chicken. I didn't want to do that.
[1971.70s -> 1974.18s]  I wanted to like pet... I just pressed A.
[1974.18s -> 1976.02s]  I did not know it was going to kick the chicken.
[1976.02s -> 1987.27s]  I already ruined it. All right, let's use it.
[1994.94s -> 1997.42s]  Oh, make a portal to another dimension.
[1998.30s -> 1999.59s]  Or whatever this does.
[2009.88s -> 2012.84s]  Right now, the production company's splash screen comes up.
[2015.61s -> 2016.17s]  The black screen.
[2023.99s -> 2024.49s]  What?
[2029.67s -> 2032.70s]  Oh, the dog.
[2034.62s -> 2038.36s]  Well, I'm glad the box didn't take us because...
[2050.30s -> 2050.94s]  Dr. Ruff.
[2054.23s -> 2057.11s]  R-U-F-F. That's Dr. Ruff PhD.
[2057.67s -> 2065.46s]  We're gonna have like a dream or something.
[2075.35s -> 2078.07s]  Quiet, boy. What do you want?
[2078.07s -> 2081.83s]  I work for Lord Lucian, miss.
[2081.83s -> 2085.03s]  And he would very much like to see you in his castle.
[2086.39s -> 2088.31s]  I've been sent to collect you.
[2089.11s -> 2092.23s]  Who's this kid?
[2096.81s -> 2099.29s]  Wait, did I like teach this kid how to do weird things?
[2100.01s -> 2101.05s]  Why is this kid in the house?
[2105.29s -> 2106.33s]  Who is this kid here?
[2114.52s -> 2115.40s]  Is this a party member?
[2116.04s -> 2117.24s]  All right. Well, cool.
[2117.24s -> 2117.80s]  Thanks, kid.
[2118.95s -> 2119.91s]  Does dog shit on him?
[2120.87s -> 2121.43s]  Wait, what's that?
[2124.39s -> 2124.87s]  I can't...
[2124.87s -> 2125.99s]  Oh, here we go.
[2125.99s -> 2135.61s]  Oh, he hates me.
[2135.61s -> 2138.81s]  Well, what are you gonna do about it?
[2138.81s -> 2147.53s]  Get out of here. Get out of my house.
[2159.42s -> 2163.10s]  It took a while for his AI to figure out what I wanted to do there.
[2163.10s -> 2163.82s]  All right, let's go.
[2164.54s -> 2167.38s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[2167.38s -> 2171.80s]  They're coming to get us.
[2171.80s -> 2173.32s]  Go to Castle Fairfax.
[2173.88s -> 2176.81s]  Hold on to the emote.
[2177.37s -> 2185.43s]  You see, why did anyone like this game?
[2185.43s -> 2188.23s]  I mean, this game 15 years ago was pretty...
[2188.31s -> 2189.11s]  It was pretty good.
[2189.67s -> 2196.94s]  Okay.
[2202.68s -> 2204.68s]  Yeah, we're very like special children, right?
[2220.47s -> 2221.43s]  Okay, I can't fart.
[2221.43s -> 2221.93s]  Sorry.
[2229.37s -> 2230.57s]  This is the best fable?
[2230.57s -> 2232.09s]  I think that's accurate.
[2232.73s -> 2234.68s]  Why is this still...
[2237.72s -> 2239.46s]  Bro, you're playing on an Xbox.
[2239.46s -> 2240.74s]  Yeah, Xbox 360.
[2249.46s -> 2250.42s]  Oh, I know the whole story.
[2250.42s -> 2251.14s]  I forgot.
[2251.14s -> 2252.34s]  You don't care if I spoil the whole game?
[2259.82s -> 2260.38s]  Okay. All right.
[2260.38s -> 2260.88s]  I won't.
[2267.50s -> 2268.92s]  All right, all right.
[2268.92s -> 2269.42s]  Yeah, we won't.
[2294.07s -> 2295.11s]  This story is so funny.
[2300.07s -> 2302.23s]  This is just a Minecraft sword.
[2303.75s -> 2305.27s]  From like the 1200s.
[2310.42s -> 2316.39s]  All right, well, let's go.
[2316.39s -> 2316.89s]  Let me in.
[2320.47s -> 2323.58s]  Hello.
[2333.74s -> 2335.11s]  Oh, he's evil, right?
[2340.47s -> 2341.91s]  What was your wish?
[2341.91s -> 2342.41s]  Exactly.
[2343.91s -> 2346.09s]  Yes, my lord.
[2346.09s -> 2347.85s]  You sold it to us.
[2347.85s -> 2348.81s]  Said it was magic.
[2349.53s -> 2351.45s]  The boxes have no interest to me.
[2351.45s -> 2353.21s]  What's remarkable is that you...
[2353.21s -> 2357.53s]  Yeah, the sideburns are like Pinocchio for evil people.
[2358.25s -> 2360.57s]  The bigger your sideburns, the more evil you really are.
[2360.57s -> 2364.18s]  If they're like an inch down, like I write, you're kind of a dick.
[2364.18s -> 2366.66s]  This far, this guy is a fucking horrible person.
[2367.38s -> 2371.48s]  Like this guy is an awful tyrant that has probably killed thousands of people.
[2371.48s -> 2373.90s]  Perhaps that could be arranged.
[2373.90s -> 2378.25s]  I am working to rebuild something wonderful.
[2378.25s -> 2381.61s]  For which I need individuals with particular talents.
[2381.61s -> 2385.35s]  Let us find out if...
[2385.35s -> 2387.27s]  If you're bald, you're good.
[2387.27s -> 2389.75s]  Would you kindly stand in the circle, please?
[2389.75s -> 2391.16s]  Oh, would you kindly?
[2391.72s -> 2392.12s]  I'll do it.
[2392.12s -> 2392.52s]  He said it.
[2392.52s -> 2393.16s]  He said the thing.
[2393.16s -> 2394.12s]  I promise.
[2394.12s -> 2399.69s]  All right, well, yeah, right.
[2399.69s -> 2400.73s]  This is like a...
[2400.73s -> 2413.64s]  You want me to get on there, too?
[2414.36s -> 2417.96s]  Stand at the center.
[2425.51s -> 2427.91s]  Like this guy's eyeing me from across the bar.
[2427.91s -> 2428.55s]  You know what I mean?
[2428.55s -> 2430.31s]  Like what did I do?
[2430.31s -> 2431.51s]  Why does this guy fucking hate me?
[2431.51s -> 2432.47s]  What's going on?
[2432.47s -> 2435.13s]  What did I do?
[2451.61s -> 2453.61s]  Now, we're junior heroes.
[2462.70s -> 2463.50s]  Oh, come on.
[2464.76s -> 2465.40s]  Come on.
[2465.40s -> 2468.04s]  That's Donald Duck from fucking Kingdom Hearts.
[2468.04s -> 2469.00s]  Get out of here.
[2469.00s -> 2469.24s]  That's...
[2469.24s -> 2470.04s]  I give myself a plus two.
[2470.04s -> 2470.44s]  I don't care.
[2486.36s -> 2487.16s]  Run.
[2487.16s -> 2490.16s]  Get down, sis.
[2500.22s -> 2501.34s]  I couldn't stand in front of her.
[2510.83s -> 2515.90s]  We just shot like a little kid.
[2527.12s -> 2528.80s]  I'm sure there was some other way to do...
[2528.80s -> 2544.57s]  To handle this.
[2544.57s -> 2546.97s]  Thanks for like letting us go get a fucking music box.
[2546.97s -> 2547.77s]  And like...
[2547.77s -> 2550.09s]  My like sister gets shot and I get thrown out of a window.
[2550.09s -> 2550.89s]  Thanks, lady.
[2550.89s -> 2561.26s]  A thousand foot drop.
[2561.26s -> 2563.26s]  Yeah, I like hit my head on the side of a building, too.
[2563.26s -> 2572.20s]  There's no way I survived, though.
[2572.20s -> 2575.00s]  Lucian disappeared from Castle Fairfax that night.
[2575.00s -> 2577.48s]  Certain that those who might stand in his way were dead.
[2578.04s -> 2582.12s]  But some grief is so great, even death may keep its distance.
[2582.84s -> 2584.44s]  And so the boy survived.
[2585.32s -> 2589.08s]  Days later, far from the dark alleys of Bowerstone,
[2589.08s -> 2592.04s]  life slowly returned to his small broken body.
[2592.04s -> 2596.28s]  The boy awoke to a familiar face watching over a strange bed.
[2596.28s -> 2599.40s]  He reached out for the comfort of the dog's warm fur.
[2599.40s -> 2602.60s]  Yeah, that was an interesting thing to get right after that cutscene.
[2603.48s -> 2607.16s]  Oh, like a little girl gets shot and you get thrown out of the window and like die.
[2608.04s -> 2611.40s]  Be careful not to hold the fart button down or you'll shit your pants.
[2619.08s -> 2621.24s]  Not really appropriate place for that tip, I don't think.
[2627.28s -> 2629.29s]  Ah, there you are.
[2629.93s -> 2631.85s]  And your faithful friend, too.
[2631.85s -> 2632.35s]  Right.
[2633.14s -> 2636.26s]  Many years ago, I promised I would help you avenge your sister's death.
[2637.44s -> 2638.40s]  That day has come.
[2639.84s -> 2643.44s]  Today, you leave the safety of this camp and seek out Lucian.
[2644.32s -> 2645.76s]  The journey will not be easy.
[2649.15s -> 2650.75s]  There's a chest near your caravan.
[2654.19s -> 2655.31s]  Oh, nice.
[2655.31s -> 2657.47s]  Meet me by the gates when you're ready to leave.
[2657.47s -> 2659.07s]  Is this where I get to learn magic?
[2659.95s -> 2663.95s]  I can't wait.
[2663.95s -> 2668.91s]  I'm going to start to learn the fire spell, the ice spell, the wind spell, the lightning spell.
[2669.55s -> 2675.78s]  Oh, can't you buy stuff?
[2676.96s -> 2677.92s]  You can buy this house.
[2677.92s -> 2681.36s]  Once you own it, you can choose to live there and receive special bonuses or rent it out to any.
[2681.36s -> 2681.86s]  Oh, wow.
[2683.82s -> 2684.62s]  How much do I have now?
[2685.18s -> 2694.48s]  Make sure you put your house up for rent before you leave.
[2695.65s -> 2696.21s]  Oh, shit.
[2696.21s -> 2696.71s]  Okay.
[2697.01s -> 2701.95s]  I don't have any weapons.
[2701.95s -> 2702.83s]  Where's my house?
[2710.88s -> 2712.72s]  Buy and move in, buy and rent out.
[2712.72s -> 2713.68s]  How much money do I have?
[2713.68s -> 2714.64s]  I have zero dollars.
[2714.64s -> 2715.28s]  I don't have any money.
[2716.08s -> 2722.16s]  That's yeah, I get his name right.
[2722.16s -> 2724.16s]  That's Dr. Ruff PhD.
[2726.10s -> 2730.50s]  Turn safety off?
[2732.58s -> 2732.74s]  What?
[2732.74s -> 2733.78s]  Do I have a gun?
[2733.78s -> 2734.34s]  What does that mean?
[2734.34s -> 2735.46s]  Turn safety off.
[2759.04s -> 2761.82s]  Is that a secondary fart?
[2761.82s -> 2763.74s]  Your actions have affected your purity.
[2763.74s -> 2764.46s]  What?
[2764.46s -> 2768.05s]  What do you mean my purity?
[2768.45s -> 2771.18s]  What?
[2771.18s -> 2772.30s]  I'm no longer pure?
[2778.50s -> 2780.26s]  Someone has just tried flirting with you.
[2780.82s -> 2782.27s]  Why not try flirting back?
[2783.74s -> 2784.54s]  Who?
[2784.54s -> 2786.40s]  What is flirt?
[2787.74s -> 2788.86s]  You got the attention of somebody.
[2789.50s -> 2790.78s]  Everyone wants to have my attention.
[2790.78s -> 2791.02s]  All right.
[2791.02s -> 2797.49s]  How about who likes me?
[2798.05s -> 2803.58s]  You like that?
[2807.57s -> 2810.69s]  Do I just keep doing this?
[2811.41s -> 2812.61s]  Everybody loves me.
[2814.67s -> 2814.91s]  All right.
[2814.91s -> 2815.79s]  I don't want to do this yet.
[2816.99s -> 2820.69s]  The villagers attracted to you.
[2820.69s -> 2824.37s]  You can use flirty, fun, and social expressions to make them like you.
[2824.37s -> 2825.65s]  Maybe even marry you.
[2828.58s -> 2828.90s]  Okay.
[2828.90s -> 2831.06s]  Don't you think that's a little quick?
[2831.94s -> 2836.26s]  I just woke up in the town and I'm going to have like a wife immediately.
[2840.66s -> 2842.58s]  You and I are now we're in love.
[2843.39s -> 2845.95s]  Oh, by the way, get you a man that can do this.
[2854.11s -> 2864.29s]  I mean, we're going to get married?
[2865.65s -> 2866.21s]  It's too...
[2866.21s -> 2867.17s]  It's so early.
[2867.81s -> 2869.25s]  It's so early for this.
[2870.61s -> 2872.05s]  I don't even know what this person is.
[2872.93s -> 2874.56s]  Are we married?
[2897.26s -> 2897.50s]  Okay.
[2897.50s -> 2898.70s]  So what is it?
[2898.70s -> 2899.02s]  Time?
[2899.66s -> 2900.38s]  Now what happens?
[2901.82s -> 2903.97s]  Okay.
[2903.97s -> 2905.49s]  I think somebody's in love with me.
[2906.29s -> 2908.11s]  Okay.
[2909.07s -> 2913.06s]  Um, flirty, a row of pickup line.
[2913.06s -> 2913.46s]  Here we go.
[2917.97s -> 2918.29s]  Okay.
[2919.17s -> 2919.57s]  Now what?
[2921.41s -> 2924.93s]  Turn safety off and start swinging at everybody.
[2924.93s -> 2925.17s]  No.
[2931.17s -> 2932.29s]  Nobody hates me here.
[2932.29s -> 2933.57s]  Hey, why does everybody hate me?
[2933.57s -> 2934.77s]  Everybody's supposed to love me.
[2934.77s -> 2942.69s]  Okay.
[2942.69s -> 2944.05s]  So let's get, get me out of here.
[2944.85s -> 2948.05s]  Now what do I do?
[2948.05s -> 2950.48s]  Give gift.
[2950.48s -> 2951.36s]  You have no items.
[2956.14s -> 2956.86s]  A birthday?
[2970.70s -> 2972.70s]  Oh God, that's disgusting.
[2981.87s -> 2983.73s]  What am I doing in public?
[2984.93s -> 2985.89s]  What am I doing?
[2990.54s -> 2990.86s]  Yeah.
[2994.05s -> 2994.29s]  All right.
[2994.29s -> 2995.01s]  I have to leave.
[2995.01s -> 2996.45s]  I need to like do a mission or something.
[2996.45s -> 2997.49s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[2998.77s -> 3002.13s]  You are loved by enough people to be Albion's dumpling?
[3005.42s -> 3005.66s]  What?
[3007.89s -> 3009.41s]  Oh, plus 34 hate.
[3009.41s -> 3009.65s]  What?
[3014.59s -> 3015.87s]  Albion's dump truck.
[3024.18s -> 3024.50s]  All right.
[3024.50s -> 3026.02s]  I have to get out of here.
[3026.02s -> 3031.79s]  Somebody say, somebody just say I'm going to puke.
[3032.51s -> 3033.39s]  I'm going to puke.
[3041.73s -> 3042.37s]  All right.
[3042.37s -> 3043.17s]  I'm going to leave.
[3043.17s -> 3043.57s]  Goodbye.
[3044.13s -> 3045.01s]  It was really fun.
[3045.01s -> 3050.18s]  Now I press down to use the follow expression to lead villages to places they like.
[3050.91s -> 3051.55s]  Oh shit.
[3051.55s -> 3051.87s]  All right.
[3056.82s -> 3057.30s]  Follow me.
[3059.54s -> 3060.02s]  Okay.
[3060.02s -> 3060.26s]  All right.
[3060.26s -> 3060.50s]  Let's go.
[3060.50s -> 3060.90s]  Let's go.
[3060.90s -> 3062.02s]  But where are we going?
[3063.78s -> 3067.26s]  I don't have any items into a bed.
[3067.26s -> 3067.74s]  Oh shit.
[3067.74s -> 3067.98s]  Okay.
[3068.54s -> 3069.58s]  Where's my bed?
[3069.58s -> 3070.62s]  Do I have a bed?
[3070.62s -> 3075.79s]  This is my house.
[3075.79s -> 3076.35s]  Oh, okay.
[3076.35s -> 3076.75s]  Let's go.
[3085.07s -> 3090.88s]  Wait, why do I have what are we doing?
[3091.52s -> 3093.28s]  Okay.
[3093.28s -> 3096.77s]  You ready to let's go to bed.
[3115.20s -> 3116.24s]  Wait, I can't.
[3116.24s -> 3117.28s]  I don't think I can do this.
[3130.13s -> 3134.02s]  This villager wants to marry you.
[3134.02s -> 3140.85s]  I thought that said rest for 20, rest for seven days.
[3141.86s -> 3142.98s]  Oh my god.
[3142.98s -> 3144.48s]  That's too much.
[3146.74s -> 3147.14s]  Hold on.
[3147.14s -> 3148.18s]  Wait, wait.
[3148.18s -> 3153.87s]  I need to get my items.
[3154.43s -> 3157.52s]  There we go.
[3157.52s -> 3158.16s]  I need a ring.
[3158.16s -> 3160.16s]  It's like 10 million dollars for a ring.
[3160.80s -> 3167.81s]  Okay.
[3167.81s -> 3168.85s]  Rusty long sword.
[3168.85s -> 3169.65s]  I'll use it.
[3169.65s -> 3171.06s]  I'll use it.
[3172.96s -> 3174.43s]  Take it.
[3174.43s -> 3175.71s]  Dog elixir.
[3175.71s -> 3177.42s]  Caller of holding.
[3178.45s -> 3179.33s]  Spade.
[3179.33s -> 3180.72s]  Okay.
[3186.45s -> 3193.17s]  STD speed run.
[3193.17s -> 3193.57s]  Don't.
[3193.57s -> 3194.21s]  No.
[3194.21s -> 3196.61s]  Wait, that can happen.
[3196.61s -> 3199.33s]  That doesn't happen, right?
[3199.33s -> 3204.61s]  Someone just tried flirting with you.
[3205.25s -> 3209.02s]  Is this the same person?
[3209.02s -> 3213.76s]  No, this is different.
[3213.76s -> 3215.36s]  This is a different person.
[3226.05s -> 3226.77s]  Rent your house.
[3231.44s -> 3232.16s]  Hold on.
[3232.16s -> 3239.97s]  Okay.
[3239.97s -> 3241.55s]  Rent out.
[3241.55s -> 3242.75s]  Base value 800.
[3242.75s -> 3243.39s]  Final price.
[3243.39s -> 3244.43s]  All right, let's rent out.
[3244.43s -> 3251.15s]  A delightful caravan that has traveled far across Albion.
[3251.15s -> 3251.79s]  Okay.
[3251.79s -> 3256.32s]  Make sure you want to rent out this property.
[3256.32s -> 3256.96s]  Yes.
[3256.96s -> 3261.55s]  Cool.
[3261.55s -> 3261.79s]  All right.
[3269.54s -> 3270.66s]  Whoa, you got a gift?
[3270.66s -> 3272.99s]  Give someone a gift.
[3280.38s -> 3286.54s]  I'm not gonna give her a caller.
[3286.54s -> 3287.58s]  Gotta get out of here.
[3290.69s -> 3292.37s]  I gotta get out of here.
[3292.37s -> 3293.33s]  I'm getting out of here.
[3293.33s -> 3294.77s]  I'm gonna do the mission.
[3294.77s -> 3297.74s]  I'm gonna do the mission.
[3298.38s -> 3300.67s]  No, everyone get away from me.
[3300.67s -> 3302.67s]  No, I'm not giving anybody a caller.
[3302.67s -> 3306.29s]  The villager wants to marry you?
[3306.29s -> 3307.26s]  Not yet.
[3307.26s -> 3309.02s]  Let me do like a mission first.
[3309.02s -> 3327.89s]  Why am I walking so slow?
[3327.89s -> 3329.09s]  Take this.
[3329.09s -> 3332.38s]  She's still following me.
[3332.38s -> 3334.06s]  Bower Lake Tomb seal.
[3342.88s -> 3344.32s]  Are you gonna keep following me?
[3353.95s -> 3354.45s]  Oh.
[3366.75s -> 3367.07s]  Okay.
[3367.94s -> 3369.78s]  Enter Bower Lake Tomb.
[3369.94s -> 3375.02s]  Throw it out.
[3375.02s -> 3378.75s]  Jock it out.
[3378.75s -> 3379.63s]  Big spot.
[3379.63s -> 3381.31s]  Oh, cool.
[3381.31s -> 3381.47s]  Nice.
[3381.47s -> 3381.71s]  All right.
[3381.71s -> 3384.72s]  Let's dig.
[3384.72s -> 3386.16s]  Give the dog the caller.
[3386.16s -> 3389.28s]  What'd I get?
[3389.28s -> 3392.37s]  A rubber ball.
[3392.37s -> 3396.83s]  You can find books that will train your dog
[3396.83s -> 3398.51s]  to find even more valuable hidden treasures.
[3398.51s -> 3398.99s]  All right.
[3398.99s -> 3400.03s]  You want to play with the ball?
[3400.03s -> 3402.90s]  You want me to throw the ball, I think.
[3402.90s -> 3405.50s]  While near your dog, you can throw the ball.
[3405.50s -> 3407.71s]  All right.
[3407.71s -> 3408.35s]  Come here.
[3408.35s -> 3409.07s]  Let's do it.
[3409.07s -> 3411.26s]  You ready?
[3411.26s -> 3416.51s]  Here we go.
[3416.51s -> 3422.91s]  Go get it.
[3422.91s -> 3424.62s]  Go get it.
[3424.62s -> 3425.18s]  What?
[3425.18s -> 3428.96s]  Go get the ball.
[3428.96s -> 3429.20s]  No.
[3429.20s -> 3429.52s]  All right.
[3434.16s -> 3434.80s]  I'll throw it this way.
[3434.80s -> 3435.76s]  Go get it this way.
[3435.76s -> 3437.49s]  Come on.
[3437.49s -> 3439.09s]  Come on.
[3439.09s -> 3440.13s]  I want to throw it for you.
[3440.13s -> 3440.93s]  Come here.
[3440.93s -> 3442.85s]  You threw it off a cliff.
[3443.49s -> 3444.93s]  It just dives.
[3444.93s -> 3448.53s]  You threw it off a cliff.
[3448.53s -> 3448.69s]  All right.
[3448.69s -> 3449.65s]  Well, how about this time?
[3449.65s -> 3451.73s]  Oh, the jump is safe.
[3451.73s -> 3451.89s]  Okay.
[3451.89s -> 3452.05s]  All right.
[3452.05s -> 3452.61s]  Come here.
[3452.61s -> 3458.29s]  I'm not going to throw it that far.
[3458.29s -> 3460.74s]  Ready?
[3460.74s -> 3461.78s]  Go get it.
[3461.78s -> 3463.84s]  Get it.
[3463.84s -> 3465.95s]  Go get it.
[3465.95s -> 3469.70s]  Did you get it?
[3469.70s -> 3471.52s]  You're kind of stupid.
[3471.52s -> 3473.01s]  It's like right there.
[3473.01s -> 3475.95s]  Go get it.
[3475.95s -> 3489.04s]  How many balls do I have?
[3489.04s -> 3490.80s]  That was such a good job.
[3490.80s -> 3493.10s]  Let's go.
[3498.43s -> 3499.68s]  What'd you find?
[3499.68s -> 3500.67s]  Treasure?
[3500.67s -> 3505.15s]  Oh my god.
[3505.15s -> 3506.11s]  You found a treasure.
[3506.11s -> 3515.52s]  It is a jet.
[3515.52s -> 3517.44s]  Nice job.
[3517.44s -> 3518.64s]  Good job.
[3518.64s -> 3521.17s]  Good boy.
[3521.17s -> 3522.37s]  Good dog.
[3522.37s -> 3524.48s]  Such a good dog.
[3524.48s -> 3525.92s]  You did such a good dog.
[3525.92s -> 3530.78s]  Did the dog swim?
[3530.78s -> 3537.02s]  All right.
[3537.02s -> 3537.34s]  Let's go.
[3540.48s -> 3541.68s]  I love that dog.
[3541.68s -> 3553.63s]  Is there like a aim?
[3553.63s -> 3554.19s]  Okay.
[3554.19s -> 3561.04s]  You called him dumb?
[3561.04s -> 3563.07s]  I mean, I said he was kind of dumb.
[3563.07s -> 3565.97s]  I didn't say he's dumb.
[3565.97s -> 3567.25s]  Therefore, I hate this dog.
[3567.25s -> 3568.45s]  I said he's a little dumb.
[3568.45s -> 3569.09s]  That's okay.
[3569.09s -> 3576.54s]  He's a doctor.
[3576.54s -> 3582.16s]  Find the Chamber of Fate.
[3582.16s -> 3587.46s]  I'm speaking to you through the Guild Seal.
[3587.46s -> 3588.02s]  He's scared.
[3588.02s -> 3589.38s]  You will need to jump into that.
[3589.38s -> 3591.09s]  It's okay.
[3591.09s -> 3591.57s]  Don't worry.
[3591.57s -> 3594.14s]  The water at the bottom will break your fall.
[3594.14s -> 3599.38s]  This dog is...
[3599.38s -> 3600.98s]  This is a dumb doctor.
[3600.98s -> 3602.06s]  Well, we both have...
[3602.06s -> 3603.42s]  We all have to go in here, right?
[3603.42s -> 3603.66s]  All right.
[3603.66s -> 3604.30s]  Let's go in.
[3604.30s -> 3606.78s]  Let's go.
[3606.78s -> 3615.28s]  Where is he?
[3615.28s -> 3621.34s]  Holy shit.
[3621.34s -> 3631.63s]  Uh-oh.
[3631.63s -> 3635.04s]  Time for the first battle of the game.
[3635.04s -> 3638.61s]  Besides that kid.
[3638.61s -> 3639.63s]  Oh.
[3639.63s -> 3640.19s]  Oh.
[3640.19s -> 3646.54s]  That was sick.
[3646.54s -> 3647.82s]  Lock onto your target.
[3647.82s -> 3650.62s]  Tap left or right to change which target you're going to focus on.
[3650.62s -> 3659.17s]  You can attack any object or person that glows red.
[3659.17s -> 3659.73s]  Yes, you can.
[3660.53s -> 3662.59s]  Those poor beetles.
[3665.63s -> 3666.59s]  Oh, that's right.
[3666.59s -> 3667.87s]  I forgot about this.
[3667.87s -> 3670.59s]  You have to kill things with a certain specialty
[3670.59s -> 3672.19s]  to get experience for that specialty.
[3672.19s -> 3673.15s]  I remember now.
[3673.15s -> 3673.63s]  I get it.
[3675.76s -> 3676.32s]  Yep.
[3676.32s -> 3676.88s]  I remember.
[3677.97s -> 3678.85s]  Use magic?
[3678.85s -> 3679.81s]  I don't have any magic.
[3680.37s -> 3689.15s]  It's like Warframe.
[3689.79s -> 3692.21s]  Silver key.
[3692.21s -> 3692.85s]  Look at the dog.
[3692.85s -> 3693.25s]  I love it.
[3699.66s -> 3701.02s]  Is that Warframe was?
[3701.02s -> 3701.90s]  Warframe?
[3701.90s -> 3703.17s]  Warframe.
[3703.17s -> 3703.81s]  Sorry.
[3703.81s -> 3711.26s]  All right.
[3711.26s -> 3712.22s]  Look at my health bar.
[3712.22s -> 3713.18s]  It's so small.
[3714.70s -> 3716.14s]  That's ridiculously small.
[3716.14s -> 3717.02s]  That's a joke.
[3717.02s -> 3720.38s]  It's like I died 15 times in a row in Dark Souls.
[3733.81s -> 3735.57s]  Easy.
[3735.57s -> 3739.04s]  It's a baby health bar.
[3739.04s -> 3740.08s]  It is tiny.
[3740.08s -> 3742.27s]  That's so small.
[3742.27s -> 3744.11s]  That's just stupidly small.
[3744.11s -> 3747.47s]  Anything in here?
[3747.47s -> 3754.37s]  No.
[3754.37s -> 3756.45s]  Quite a small health bar you have here.
[3756.45s -> 3757.41s]  Yeah, it is.
[3757.41s -> 3759.78s]  It can definitely be increased, though.
[3759.78s -> 3760.66s]  Don't worry.
[3760.66s -> 3770.46s]  If I remember, melee was actually pretty fun in these games, wasn't it?
[3771.26s -> 3772.62s]  Don't you have to string together combos?
[3783.28s -> 3784.08s]  Yes, you do.
[3784.08s -> 3785.52s]  Be sure to explore the world around you.
[3785.52s -> 3787.20s]  Following the glowing trail is extremely useful,
[3787.20s -> 3789.44s]  but there's so much to find off the beaten path.
[3789.44s -> 3791.12s]  We're exploring other corners of this cavern.
[3793.10s -> 3794.54s]  Is there going to be something for me?
[3795.10s -> 3798.05s]  Where's the bones?
[3799.46s -> 3800.74s]  Brendan's Diary.
[3800.74s -> 3803.60s]  It appears to be a page from an explorer's diary,
[3803.60s -> 3806.08s]  recording the details of an expedition into this cave.
[3806.08s -> 3809.25s]  My hand is shaking from exhaustion, but I must remain vigilant.
[3809.25s -> 3811.89s]  I almost nodded off last night as we camped around the fire.
[3811.89s -> 3814.53s]  I still manage to keep an eye on Eric and Drake.
[3814.53s -> 3817.25s]  I have seen the greedy glimmer in their eyes.
[3817.25s -> 3819.33s]  They mean to make the treasure theirs.
[3819.33s -> 3823.84s]  Oh, maybe it's time to make use of the poison.
[3823.84s -> 3824.64s]  Oh, shit.
[3826.11s -> 3826.75s]  Not Aaron.
[3826.75s -> 3827.47s]  Eric.
[3827.47s -> 3834.13s]  I just hit my head on that.
[3834.69s -> 3839.81s]  Brendan.
[3839.81s -> 3840.05s]  No.
[3840.85s -> 3841.57s]  Everybody hates that.
[3844.80s -> 3845.92s]  Eric's letter.
[3845.92s -> 3849.79s]  Soon we'll be rich.
[3850.43s -> 3851.25s]  Whatever.
[3851.25s -> 3858.64s]  There's not very many people that like the Aaron.
[3864.24s -> 3865.28s]  Wait, can I go up?
[3865.28s -> 3869.36s]  Can I get up there?
[3872.83s -> 3879.62s]  Nope.
[3879.62s -> 3881.62s]  How am I supposed to use magic if I don't have magic?
[3882.18s -> 3892.59s]  Do I get blessed at some point here in the minute?
[3892.59s -> 3895.87s]  I hate Attack on Titan so much.
[3898.18s -> 3907.74s]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[3907.74s -> 3913.81s]  I don't know.
[3913.81s -> 3917.95s]  Range weapon.
[3917.95s -> 3919.47s]  I like the ranged.
[3919.47s -> 3921.87s]  I really like the ranged, though, guys.
[3922.43s -> 3924.03s]  You just ignored that guy?
[3924.93s -> 3925.97s]  No, I would.
[3925.97s -> 3928.69s]  Okay, I've seen Attack on Titan.
[3929.17s -> 3937.55s]  I got through the first like five episodes and I was just like,
[3940.38s -> 3942.70s]  it was just like, I just too much for me.
[3942.70s -> 3944.30s]  I was just like, I can't do this.
[3956.11s -> 3956.51s]  Liar.
[3968.94s -> 3970.38s]  Outstanding fight.
[3970.38s -> 3970.70s]  Thanks.
[3971.58s -> 3973.34s]  You watched it till 3 a.m.
[3973.34s -> 3975.34s]  You don't know anything about what I've done.
[3976.06s -> 3984.53s]  Please watch anything but Attack on Titan.
[3994.14s -> 3994.38s]  What is that?
[3994.38s -> 3995.70s]  What is that?
[3995.70s -> 3996.18s]  What's that from?
[3996.18s -> 3996.82s]  That's from something.
[3998.99s -> 3999.39s]  What is that?
[4008.91s -> 4009.87s]  What is that?
[4009.87s -> 4015.10s]  Is he serious?
[4015.10s -> 4015.66s]  No, I like it.
[4015.66s -> 4017.02s]  I feel like I've heard that somewhere.
[4017.02s -> 4019.63s]  That like it's not.
[4019.63s -> 4020.03s]  No, no, no.
[4020.03s -> 4020.91s]  Not the song.
[4020.91s -> 4024.75s]  I know like the I'm talking about like the zoo, zoo, zoos.
[4025.31s -> 4036.18s]  It's from Jimmy Neutron guy.
[4036.18s -> 4037.38s]  Okay, listen, listen, listen, listen.
[4037.38s -> 4038.80s]  I got to clear this up.
[4038.80s -> 4045.12s]  I know that that's like the intro to the first season.
[4045.12s -> 4047.84s]  I'm talking about not the tune I was doing.
[4047.84s -> 4049.20s]  I'm talking about the zoos.
[4049.20s -> 4051.76s]  Like that's from something weird.
[4052.56s -> 4053.76s]  And I can't put my finger on it.
[4059.98s -> 4060.70s]  What is what is what is it?
[4060.70s -> 4062.78s]  Choon.
[4062.78s -> 4063.66s]  It's Jimmy Neutron.
[4072.32s -> 4074.32s]  The French song from the 80s.
[4074.32s -> 4074.56s]  What?
[4083.95s -> 4086.19s]  Oh, 150 gold pieces.
[4086.75s -> 4090.05s]  I think it's a random noise that you just thought of.
[4091.78s -> 4092.98s]  Yeah, maybe.
[4099.42s -> 4100.78s]  The hero of Oakvale.
[4102.99s -> 4104.51s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[4104.51s -> 4114.00s]  No, it's real.
[4114.64s -> 4116.29s]  Oh, a mood ring.
[4116.93s -> 4121.25s]  All right, I have a ring.
[4121.25s -> 4122.37s]  I can get married.
[4122.37s -> 4127.62s]  It's from Augie and the Cockroaches.
[4129.58s -> 4131.74s]  You just made that show up.
[4131.74s -> 4132.70s]  That you made that.
[4132.70s -> 4133.50s]  You made that up.
[4133.50s -> 4140.18s]  That's not a real thing.
[4154.70s -> 4155.66s]  I've never heard of that show.
[4163.66s -> 4164.16s]  Hmm.
[4170.06s -> 4174.06s]  No man alive today remembers the night the guild burned.
[4174.06s -> 4175.98s]  And now it lies forgotten.
[4176.70s -> 4178.46s]  But the heroes are not all gone.
[4179.34s -> 4180.22s]  You are here.
[4180.94s -> 4183.66s]  And that same heroic blood flows through you.
[4184.46s -> 4185.02s]  It is.
[4185.02s -> 4185.66s]  It's real.
[4186.62s -> 4190.78s]  You're for the mightiest heroes who ever live.
[4190.78s -> 4193.74s]  At a young age, he suffered a devastating loss.
[4193.74s -> 4196.06s]  From which he never is alert alert alert.
[4196.06s -> 4196.62s]  Hold on.
[4196.62s -> 4199.34s]  But when the world tried to crush him, he fought back.
[4200.14s -> 4204.06s]  He grew strong, strong enough to reshape the world as he saw fit.
[4204.96s -> 4205.92s]  You must do the same.
[4205.92s -> 4206.32s]  What is it?
[4206.32s -> 4207.44s]  Y'all are weird as fuck.
[4207.44s -> 4210.51s]  The guild has reacted to you.
[4210.51s -> 4211.47s]  Step into the light.
[4212.19s -> 4212.91s]  Learn the true power of you.
[4212.91s -> 4214.75s]  Y'all are weird as fuck.
[4221.39s -> 4221.79s]  I need to...
[4221.79s -> 4222.51s]  All right, where is it?
[4231.73s -> 4232.77s]  There's no more links allowed.
[4232.77s -> 4233.73s]  But Maude's gonna have to do it.
[4233.73s -> 4237.10s]  Into strength, skill.
[4237.10s -> 4238.70s]  Strength improves combat.
[4238.70s -> 4244.70s]  With skill allows you to shoot faster and with greater accuracy.
[4245.50s -> 4248.06s]  Will gives you control over the forces of magic.
[4250.83s -> 4252.43s]  I'll give you the cockroach's intro.
[4252.43s -> 4252.91s]  Okay, hold on.
[4253.95s -> 4255.31s]  It reacts to the will of...
[4255.31s -> 4257.31s]  Yeah, yeah, I got strength, agility, or...
[4257.31s -> 4259.39s]  You have not been able to use will yet.
[4259.39s -> 4263.07s]  But the simple act of reaching this place has given you will experience.
[4263.79s -> 4267.07s]  You need to learn a will ability to activate the color's gate.
[4267.71s -> 4268.51s]  All right, is this it?
[4289.98s -> 4291.10s]  Where's the zzzz?
[4291.10s -> 4291.66s]  I don't hear it.
[4304.48s -> 4307.26s]  That's not what I was...
[4307.26s -> 4309.02s]  That's not what I was doing.
[4317.54s -> 4318.98s]  How would you even know that?
[4319.54s -> 4320.10s]  I don't even know...
[4320.10s -> 4322.69s]  How would you even remember this?
[4322.69s -> 4324.53s]  There's no way you could even remember that shit.
[4326.77s -> 4328.45s]  Fuck, it is that, but that's not it.
[4333.12s -> 4334.48s]  That's so funny.
[4334.48s -> 4338.08s]  You should buy a will ability so that you can activate that color's gate.
[4340.80s -> 4342.96s]  Sorry, I'm sorry.
[4342.96s -> 4343.46s]  Hold on.
[4348.02s -> 4348.52s]  Okay.
[4352.16s -> 4354.92s]  No, I don't want to throw the ball to the dog.
[4358.56s -> 4359.20s]  No, don't...
[4361.84s -> 4362.34s]  Will.
[4364.40s -> 4364.90s]  Shock.
[4365.76s -> 4366.88s]  Inferno.
[4366.88s -> 4367.76s]  Time control.
[4368.96s -> 4369.46s]  Blades.
[4371.60s -> 4372.16s]  Oh, hold on.
[4372.16s -> 4372.96s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4378.56s -> 4380.56s]  Okay, area damage, target damage.
[4382.71s -> 4383.21s]  Inferno.
[4384.85s -> 4385.73s]  Inferno.
[4385.73s -> 4389.57s]  Calls forth magical flames to scorch and burn your foes.
[4389.57s -> 4390.53s]  That's from Frasier.
[4393.06s -> 4395.14s]  No, that's not from Frasier.
[4395.14s -> 4397.65s]  In the Frasier intro, he doesn't go...
[4401.65s -> 4402.15s]  It's...
[4405.65s -> 4406.69s]  He actually talks.
[4406.69s -> 4410.26s]  It's like a song.
[4410.26s -> 4410.76s]  He's like...
[4415.46s -> 4418.63s]  He doesn't say, like, zzzz.
[4418.63s -> 4429.73s]  I like this one.
[4429.73s -> 4435.59s]  Oh, fuck.
[4435.59s -> 4436.55s]  Okay, I gotta stop.
[4438.39s -> 4439.40s]  This one's cool.
[4440.12s -> 4442.63s]  I like that.
[4442.63s -> 4443.43s]  Okay, vortex.
[4444.07s -> 4448.26s]  Vortex creates a powerful windstorm that will pummel your enemies.
[4448.26s -> 4449.70s]  Ooh, alright.
[4449.70s -> 4450.50s]  This one's good too.
[4453.48s -> 4454.28s]  Vortex.
[4454.28s -> 4454.78s]  Chaos.
[4455.70s -> 4458.98s]  Chaos confuses your foes, making them unpredictable.
[4458.98s -> 4462.42s]  They may flee, attack their fellows, or even fall in love with you.
[4462.42s -> 4462.92s]  Chaos.
[4467.12s -> 4470.80s]  Force push sends a blast of energy towards your enemies,
[4470.80s -> 4472.40s]  hurling them into nearby objects.
[4472.40s -> 4472.90s]  Mm.
[4472.90s -> 4475.06s]  It is very effective in confined spaces.
[4475.06s -> 4476.10s]  Raise the dead.
[4476.10s -> 4480.90s]  Raise dead causes the bones of the recently deceased to rise and fight for you.
[4482.84s -> 4483.56s]  Okay, that's cool.
[4485.08s -> 4486.44s]  I think I want chaos.
[4488.14s -> 4491.34s]  Chaos confuses your foes, making them unpredictable.
[4491.34s -> 4494.86s]  They may flee, attack their fellows, or even fall in love with you.
[4495.82s -> 4496.62s]  No, do lightning.
[4496.62s -> 4497.98s]  No, I'm doing chaos.
[4499.02s -> 4499.74s]  What?
[4499.74s -> 4501.70s]  Oh, I don't have enough.
[4501.70s -> 4507.61s]  I can only do shock or inferno, and we're doing shock.
[4508.92s -> 4510.28s]  Shock stuns your enemies.
[4511.16s -> 4514.38s]  Okay, shock.
[4522.25s -> 4522.81s]  Abilities.
[4524.22s -> 4525.18s]  Strength, okay.
[4525.18s -> 4527.18s]  Brutal styles, physique, toughness.
[4529.99s -> 4530.47s]  Locking?
[4530.47s -> 4534.23s]  Brutal styles unlock special moves for use in close combat.
[4534.23s -> 4538.38s]  You still have a shit in your pants.
[4539.91s -> 4544.87s]  Yes, and I had unprotected sex with a big dump in my underwear.
[4544.87s -> 4547.59s]  That's when you want to get gross?
[4547.59s -> 4548.47s]  Go ahead.
[4548.47s -> 4553.05s]  Physique is just HP, right?
[4553.05s -> 4554.65s]  The stronger your physique,
[4554.65s -> 4557.29s]  the more damage you will cause with close combat weapons.
[4557.29s -> 4558.01s]  No, it's toughness.
[4558.73s -> 4560.90s]  I don't have enough to do anything.
[4560.90s -> 4563.14s]  ...is able to withstand more damage before...
[4563.14s -> 4565.14s]  Brutal styles unlock special moves...
[4565.14s -> 4568.12s]  I can do this one, brutal styles.
[4568.12s -> 4568.52s]  Lock.
[4568.52s -> 4571.16s]  You can now hold down X to block enemy's melee attacks.
[4571.16s -> 4571.80s]  All right, let's go.
[4572.84s -> 4579.30s]  All right, so now I have my skill.
[4579.30s -> 4581.62s]  Can you feel the power coursing through you?
[4581.62s -> 4582.10s]  I can.
[4582.10s -> 4583.30s]  It is only the beginning.
[4584.98s -> 4588.66s]  Use your abilities to hit the split switch and power up the gate.
[4589.46s -> 4590.18s]  Click the switch.
[4590.18s -> 4592.34s]  Once activated, it will allow you to travel back to Brower Lake.
[4592.34s -> 4593.46s]  Whoa.
[4593.46s -> 4602.73s]  Come on, this is Chester.
[4604.86s -> 4609.91s]  Go to www.fable2.com to access the golden items.
[4609.91s -> 4611.19s]  What is this, a fucking ad?
[4611.99s -> 4617.82s]  Now you are ready to begin your journey.
[4618.54s -> 4619.50s]  Use the color space.
[4619.50s -> 4620.00s]  Oh!
[4622.22s -> 4623.02s]  Power up!
[4623.02s -> 4624.62s]  Oh, voice crack.
[4624.62s -> 4625.90s]  Too much power in my hands.
[4625.90s -> 4627.90s]  Not enough power going into my vocal cords.
[4627.90s -> 4629.99s]  That's understandable.
[4629.99s -> 4647.37s]  Damn, that was embarrassing, dude.
[4647.37s -> 4648.01s]  No, it's all right.
[4648.01s -> 4649.61s]  Did you see how much lightning I shot out of my hand?
[4654.78s -> 4657.18s]  Use your newfound abilities to defeat them.
[4657.18s -> 4657.58s]  All right.
[4665.77s -> 4668.73s]  I've never done magic in Fable, but wow, this is pretty good.
[4670.02s -> 4670.52s]  Wow.
[4677.45s -> 4678.17s]  That's pretty good.
[4678.17s -> 4685.91s]  Those two orbs hold the knowledge and experience of the creatures that you kill.
[4685.91s -> 4686.23s]  Cool.
[4686.23s -> 4687.19s]  All right, I did it.
[4688.76s -> 4689.80s]  Seven dollars income?
[4689.80s -> 4691.32s]  Oh, somebody's renting the house.
[4691.32s -> 4693.53s]  That's not very much money.
[4697.93s -> 4699.13s]  Can I die if I jump off this?
[4701.22s -> 4702.34s]  Unlimited power!
[4703.30s -> 4709.14s]  Is it mana?
[4709.14s -> 4710.18s]  I guess there's no mana.
[4710.90s -> 4717.80s]  Pretending?
[4717.80s -> 4725.78s]  Wait, what?
[4725.78s -> 4726.34s]  Oh, shit.
[4726.90s -> 4732.36s]  Wait, what?
[4732.36s -> 4733.00s]  Reload?
[4733.72s -> 4737.18s]  How come everyone said I was...
[4737.18s -> 4738.06s]  Wait, because I didn't...
[4738.86s -> 4740.14s]  I thought somebody said I could...
[4740.14s -> 4740.78s]  Right trigger?
[4741.50s -> 4746.46s]  No, I think these are just glitched out from old right trigger.
[4746.46s -> 4747.66s]  Yeah, no, I can't pick these up.
[4751.16s -> 4752.04s]  Yeah, this is just...
[4757.50s -> 4758.38s]  Yeah, this is not...
[4758.38s -> 4759.18s]  I can't pick this.
[4759.18s -> 4760.30s]  This is like a glitch from the lightning.
[4760.86s -> 4765.86s]  Yeah, what are you guys talking about?
[4772.62s -> 4773.98s]  Watch Frasier on stream.
[4777.99s -> 4778.95s]  I didn't...
[4778.95s -> 4780.31s]  I never got into Frasier.
[4780.31s -> 4780.95s]  I didn't get it.
[4781.51s -> 4782.58s]  I just couldn't.
[4782.58s -> 4783.30s]  I was just like...
[4783.30s -> 4784.98s]  I couldn't follow anything going on.
[4785.62s -> 4791.10s]  I think I was just too young.
[4791.10s -> 4793.02s]  I was too young to care about Frasier.
[4797.19s -> 4799.27s]  The only thing that's in my brain from Frasier
[4800.23s -> 4800.63s]  is...
[4800.63s -> 4801.83s]  I don't know why, but like...
[4802.94s -> 4806.78s]  Him doing like Kramer-esque entrances into rooms
[4806.78s -> 4808.38s]  and like erratic movements and stuff
[4809.02s -> 4810.74s]  is like all I can see in my head.
[4812.26s -> 4813.62s]  I don't know why that's in my brain.
[4813.62s -> 4814.82s]  He's like opening a door going like,
[4815.14s -> 4816.34s]  What happened here?
[4816.34s -> 4821.42s]  I don't know why I'm making him and Kramer the same person.
[4821.42s -> 4826.10s]  Like in my brain right now,
[4826.10s -> 4828.74s]  I'm watching him open the door to Jerry's apartment
[4828.74s -> 4830.10s]  and like be Kramer.
[4830.10s -> 4832.22s]  I don't know why.
[4832.22s -> 4838.65s]  Can I eat those?
[4838.65s -> 4845.45s]  This is a silver key chest.
[4845.45s -> 4847.21s]  The number of keys needed to open it shown on the chest.
[4847.21s -> 4848.01s]  Oh, I can open it.
[4848.01s -> 4848.81s]  I only needed one.
[4851.50s -> 4852.14s]  Dog tricks.
[4852.14s -> 4852.94s]  The bunny hop.
[4854.31s -> 4856.71s]  Dog trainer and circus owner Rufina Musket.
[4857.43s -> 4858.31s]  Oh, shit.
[4860.89s -> 4861.77s]  Teach the dog a trick.
[4862.33s -> 4864.95s]  All right, come here, you.
[4864.95s -> 4867.91s]  Come here.
[4867.91s -> 4868.87s]  No, I want to...
[4868.87s -> 4871.96s]  Come here, I got to train you.
[4872.04s -> 4872.76s]  Come here.
[4872.76s -> 4874.65s]  No, come here.
[4874.65s -> 4876.66s]  All right, come here.
[4876.66s -> 4877.46s]  Watch this.
[4877.46s -> 4887.74s]  The dog can now bunny hop to see him do this.
[4887.74s -> 4890.94s]  Dance, laugh, whistle, play the lute or strike a heroic pose.
[4890.94s -> 4893.18s]  Okay.
[4893.18s -> 4902.76s]  Do you dance?
[4903.48s -> 4908.04s]  Is it?
[4908.60s -> 4914.95s]  All right, let's look for more treasure chests.
[4914.95s -> 4919.53s]  What's in here?
[4920.25s -> 4924.68s]  Keep it out for dive spots.
[4927.93s -> 4928.73s]  Oh, shit.
[4928.73s -> 4929.45s]  25 gold.
[4929.45s -> 4929.69s]  Nice.
[4930.41s -> 4937.18s]  All right, I can marry somebody now.
[4937.18s -> 4944.09s]  He's trying his best.
[4944.09s -> 4944.97s]  Yeah, he's doing fine.
[4945.77s -> 4948.66s]  He's doing great.
[4953.11s -> 4954.31s]  I was going to shock that guy.
[4957.93s -> 4958.65s]  Activity.
[4960.07s -> 4965.59s]  I'm afraid as long as the bandit tag is alive, the road stays closed.
[4966.47s -> 4967.11s]  We got to get rid of...
[4968.79s -> 4970.95s]  You could always take care of tag yourself.
[4971.59s -> 4973.59s]  I mean, when germ is streaming right now.
[4974.39s -> 4976.17s]  Okay.
[4976.73s -> 4978.41s]  The road to barstone is closed.
[4979.13s -> 4982.97s]  It would seem that has been capturing traders on their way to the bow lake camp.
[4983.93s -> 4986.09s]  He is a danger to all must be dealt with.
[4987.21s -> 4988.25s]  He's giving money.
[4988.25s -> 4992.01s]  You should be able to defeat him and his gang and continue your quest.
[4992.73s -> 4995.37s]  No doubt they are at his camp near bow lake.
[4995.37s -> 4996.74s]  All right, let's go get him.
[5002.04s -> 5003.16s]  Yo, when's this guy streaming?
[5007.05s -> 5007.69s]  Put it out.
[5009.35s -> 5009.91s]  How mad is he?
[5009.91s -> 5011.24s]  I just got here.
[5011.24s -> 5012.04s]  I'm not mad at all.
[5012.04s -> 5012.76s]  I'm perfectly fine.
[5013.32s -> 5019.51s]  Why do you guess I'm not...
[5019.51s -> 5020.39s]  I am not angry.
[5020.39s -> 5020.87s]  I'm happy.
[5021.43s -> 5022.55s]  I'm playing Fable 2.
[5023.11s -> 5024.55s]  Super nostalgic right now.
[5024.55s -> 5026.07s]  Having a lot of nostalgia fun.
[5026.07s -> 5028.15s]  By the way, don't miss next Sunday's stream.
[5028.15s -> 5030.82s]  Just want to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[5030.82s -> 5042.33s]  It may be a trap.
[5042.33s -> 5043.85s]  Sunday stream is going to be interesting.
[5044.74s -> 5046.97s]  I have an obligation.
[5046.97s -> 5049.69s]  Somebody has been blowing my phone up for a long time.
[5050.97s -> 5053.77s]  Finally going to get this person the opportunity they wanted a long time ago.
[5054.97s -> 5056.49s]  They're very excited.
[5056.49s -> 5057.29s]  Of course they are.
[5059.32s -> 5060.92s]  Just I'm not going to be on the stream.
[5060.92s -> 5063.24s]  I'm just going to let them do whatever they want.
[5064.76s -> 5066.76s]  And hopefully it's good.
[5066.76s -> 5072.62s]  I don't know.
[5072.62s -> 5073.18s]  Bandits.
[5073.98s -> 5077.29s]  Oh, that was easy.
[5087.45s -> 5088.49s]  Anybody else?
[5088.49s -> 5095.50s]  What do you mean I've been hurt by an enemy?
[5102.44s -> 5104.12s]  Oh my god, magic is awesome.
[5110.34s -> 5112.10s]  You can now afford force push.
[5114.79s -> 5116.63s]  It's just Jedi Academy again.
[5122.50s -> 5124.66s]  Yeah, it is Jedi Academy again, isn't it?
[5127.86s -> 5129.06s]  Oh shit, that was cool.
[5141.11s -> 5142.63s]  You got to keep like a combo going, right?
[5143.19s -> 5149.64s]  They're just waiting for you to kill them.
[5150.87s -> 5151.37s]  Whoa!
[5166.84s -> 5169.00s]  Oh shit, one, two, three.
[5170.38s -> 5170.88s]  Watch out!
[5174.22s -> 5177.78s]  Wait, did I kill him?
[5177.78s -> 5178.82s]  Why did I kill him?
[5179.62s -> 5190.42s]  Oh dog, are you all right?
[5191.14s -> 5198.81s]  Just shooting in random directions.
[5206.79s -> 5211.14s]  Okay, I got him.
[5211.14s -> 5212.10s]  You're now famous.
[5216.60s -> 5217.80s]  Dog, you hurt the dog.
[5217.80s -> 5218.84s]  I got him, I got him, I got him.
[5225.53s -> 5226.01s]  Come here.
[5229.24s -> 5230.04s]  The new hero.
[5230.04s -> 5230.60s]  All right, come here.
[5231.16s -> 5232.35s]  Come here.
[5238.70s -> 5241.80s]  You good?
[5241.80s -> 5242.68s]  There we go.
[5242.68s -> 5243.24s]  All right.
[5243.24s -> 5244.04s]  Good boy.
[5244.68s -> 5252.44s]  You all right?
[5252.44s -> 5253.32s]  Yes, you're okay.
[5253.32s -> 5258.22s]  Oh, that keeps it in his chest.
[5258.22s -> 5259.18s]  Don't worry, stand back.
[5259.74s -> 5262.81s]  That's not hurting him, is it?
[5262.81s -> 5273.16s]  What do you got in here?
[5274.95s -> 5278.39s]  Cage key, rancid beef jerky, and a money bag.
[5279.19s -> 5279.59s]  Nice.
[5279.59s -> 5280.39s]  All right, anything else?
[5282.60s -> 5283.16s]  Dog tricks.
[5283.80s -> 5292.84s]  I don't know, whatever.
[5292.84s -> 5294.86s]  Hey, mate!
[5294.86s -> 5296.86s]  Don't even think about letting them out.
[5298.31s -> 5300.15s]  Those slaves belong to me.
[5300.71s -> 5302.31s]  I paid for them.
[5302.31s -> 5303.11s]  Are you?
[5303.11s -> 5303.61s]  Okay.
[5303.61s -> 5305.35s]  Look, I don't want any trouble.
[5306.63s -> 5309.43s]  Give the key to me and I'll make it worth your while.
[5310.78s -> 5312.38s]  No, don't listen to him.
[5312.38s -> 5313.26s]  Never.
[5313.26s -> 5314.06s]  Shut up.
[5316.41s -> 5317.77s]  You wouldn't do that to us.
[5317.77s -> 5318.73s]  What'd you sparrow?
[5320.06s -> 5321.58s]  I said shut it.
[5321.58s -> 5323.02s]  I'm not gonna tell you again.
[5326.38s -> 5326.88s]  Uh.
[5328.60s -> 5331.00s]  Sir, what do you say, stranger?
[5331.00s -> 5332.28s]  Do you like giving a living?
[5332.28s -> 5333.24s]  Am I this bad?
[5333.24s -> 5334.12s]  I can't hit him.
[5334.12s -> 5344.06s]  Kill this piece of garbage, no problem.
[5344.06s -> 5345.59s]  You're right, I could, couldn't I?
[5345.59s -> 5346.95s]  Now you've gone and earned it.
[5346.95s -> 5356.14s]  You gonna say sorry?
[5356.14s -> 5359.85s]  Are you gonna say sorry or should I give you more juice?
[5359.85s -> 5360.41s]  Say sorry.
[5361.05s -> 5365.56s]  There is something you must see.
[5365.56s -> 5367.61s]  Come on, guys, let's go.
[5367.61s -> 5376.95s]  Thank you so much.
[5376.95s -> 5383.42s]  Free to wander the paths and byways of the land.
[5383.42s -> 5385.74s]  No, master, but the wind itself.
[5385.74s -> 5392.20s]  Time stretched out before is like, like, that's the word I want, Reg.
[5392.20s -> 5393.99s]  I don't know.
[5394.71s -> 5395.83s]  Turn safety on.
[5395.83s -> 5396.79s]  Turn safety on.
[5396.79s -> 5397.83s]  I'm going now.
[5397.83s -> 5398.63s]  Thanks again.
[5398.63s -> 5400.07s]  Should I turn safety back on or leave it off?
[5400.07s -> 5401.11s]  Oh, yes, thanks.
[5401.11s -> 5410.39s]  All right, I'm turning safety on.
[5410.39s -> 5416.47s]  All right, let me, hold on, let me look at what else we got.
[5417.43s -> 5418.89s]  They might have some fucking goodies.
[5419.93s -> 5427.62s]  It'll be funnier if it's off.
[5427.62s -> 5428.26s]  Not yet.
[5428.26s -> 5431.22s]  Let me at least get to, like, level two magician and then maybe.
[5431.22s -> 5434.66s]  All right, let's go back.
[5434.66s -> 5437.24s]  I can level up.
[5437.24s -> 5440.46s]  Can I level up right here?
[5440.46s -> 5455.03s]  I was at nothing in any of those.
[5455.03s -> 5459.02s]  House, house, house, house, house.
[5459.02s -> 5460.22s]  I'm looking at the house.
[5460.22s -> 5467.13s]  What's that?
[5467.13s -> 5468.49s]  Buy and move in.
[5468.49s -> 5473.21s]  This thing is 5,500 bucks near the door.
[5473.21s -> 5480.06s]  Is there money?
[5480.06s -> 5483.80s]  I can sleep in this guy's bed?
[5484.36s -> 5492.02s]  Oh, I thought that was a pot.
[5492.66s -> 5494.44s]  There's one gold in here.
[5494.44s -> 5494.84s]  Thanks, guys.
[5494.84s -> 5496.28s]  I'm glad I went back for it.
[5496.28s -> 5503.32s]  All right, where do I want to go?
[5503.32s -> 5507.69s]  What does, what's over here?
[5507.69s -> 5517.45s]  Is there anything ever in barrels?
[5517.45s -> 5518.81s]  Is there no reason for me to do this?
[5525.43s -> 5526.63s]  All the crates are always empty.
[5526.63s -> 5529.03s]  Okay, thank you.
[5529.03s -> 5530.39s]  Exactly what I was looking for.
[5530.39s -> 5541.19s]  Look at that pop in.
[5549.13s -> 5565.46s]  Do you get a horse in this game eventually?
[5565.46s -> 5568.70s]  This looks like, okay, you know what this looks like?
[5568.70s -> 5573.88s]  This looks like the full motion, pre-rendered,
[5573.88s -> 5576.92s]  like, advertising material for the game.
[5576.92s -> 5578.12s]  Do you know what I'm talking about?
[5578.12s -> 5588.28s]  This always seems really interlaced.
[5588.28s -> 5593.99s]  It's like a pre-rendered video of something,
[5593.99s -> 5595.59s]  but they have the settings all wrong.
[5595.59s -> 5605.67s]  But it's not even like, it's like a trailer.
[5605.67s -> 5614.17s]  Okay, it's me.
[5618.81s -> 5620.17s]  Well, it's my first one.
[5620.17s -> 5621.77s]  I'm just starting out.
[5621.77s -> 5622.57s]  How's it go?
[5622.57s -> 5623.61s]  Listen to this.
[5623.61s -> 5628.62s]  A hero went to Bower Lake and gave the thug a bellyache.
[5631.32s -> 5632.92s]  That's all I've got so far,
[5632.92s -> 5635.08s]  but maybe if I walk around Bowerstone with you,
[5635.08s -> 5636.20s]  I'll get some inspiration.
[5640.15s -> 5641.75s]  Really is quite foul.
[5644.78s -> 5645.74s]  That wasn't even a song.
[5647.50s -> 5649.82s]  You can't go to class with your book report,
[5649.82s -> 5651.74s]  with the title of the book report.
[5651.74s -> 5653.50s]  Come on, you're going to stop me
[5653.50s -> 5655.50s]  before I get in the hero of Bowerstone
[5655.98s -> 5658.78s]  and give me like, the fucking title of your song.
[5658.78s -> 5662.36s]  You know how much value my time is right now?
[5662.36s -> 5670.04s]  Trophy.
[5670.04s -> 5673.21s]  What was that?
[5673.21s -> 5679.18s]  Oh, thank you.
[5679.18s -> 5679.68s]  Hello.
[5681.10s -> 5682.62s]  Have you seen how big my muscles are?
[5696.26s -> 5697.06s]  How about a dance?
[5705.53s -> 5706.65s]  Oh, plus 24.
[5706.65s -> 5707.37s]  Holy shit.
[5707.37s -> 5710.46s]  Am I a chicken chaser?
[5710.46s -> 5711.02s]  No.
[5711.02s -> 5714.07s]  What else have we got?
[5715.83s -> 5718.95s]  Okay, a victory arm pump.
[5719.35s -> 5721.37s]  Very good.
[5731.13s -> 5734.11s]  Okay.
[5736.34s -> 5736.90s]  Thank you.
[5736.90s -> 5739.06s]  Hey, how about you and I get a coffee sometime?
[5739.06s -> 5743.05s]  I was open to see you today.
[5760.06s -> 5760.56s]  What?
[5768.44s -> 5770.28s]  This is so exciting.
[5770.28s -> 5771.08s]  Oh shit, where am I?
[5771.08s -> 5771.72s]  Where am I?
[5771.72s -> 5772.52s]  I have a ring, don't I?
[5773.32s -> 5774.89s]  I have a ring.
[5774.89s -> 5788.60s]  I'm already married.
[5788.60s -> 5789.10s]  No, I'm not.

[5801.05s -> 5802.17s]  Rachel, the housewife.
[5802.25s -> 5803.53s]  Middle class straight flirt.
[5804.33s -> 5807.27s]  Likes Fairfax demon door.

[5812.22s -> 5818.60s]  What did I just do?
[5819.16s -> 5821.90s]  Did I just give her a ring?
[5828.28s -> 5829.80s]  Did I just give it to her?
[5829.80s -> 5831.94s]  I just gave her the ring.
[5836.98s -> 5837.94s]  I gave her a book.
[5837.94s -> 5839.30s]  The Hero of Oakvale.
[5841.90s -> 5842.40s]  Harry.
[5843.10s -> 5844.30s]  Rancid beef jerky.
[5857.50s -> 5858.00s]  All right.

[5875.34s -> 5879.54s]  It's a shit ring?
[5888.47s -> 5889.27s]  How much money do I have?
[5892.50s -> 5894.18s]  You gave her the ring pop ring.
[5895.30s -> 5896.74s]  This guy's chasing me.
[5896.74s -> 5897.46s]  Get away from me.
[5904.65s -> 5905.45s]  That's a cool bridge.
[5908.41s -> 5910.49s]  Just want to make everyone really clear around me.
[5910.49s -> 5911.05s]  Safety's off.
[5913.61s -> 5914.81s]  I just want everyone to know that here.
[5920.60s -> 5923.77s]  Anything I can help you with?
[5925.93s -> 5926.43s]  Cheers.
[5926.81s -> 5928.41s]  I'll pick it up tomorrow.

[6473.48s -> 6474.60s]  That's pathetic.

[6488.17s -> 6488.41s]  Yeah.
[6488.41s -> 6489.37s]  I mean, all right.

[6504.94s -> 6506.06s]  It's a bunch of atoms.
[6506.62s -> 6514.86s]  Play VR at 24 FPS.
[6516.81s -> 6517.21s]  Cool.
[6517.21s -> 6517.37s]  Yeah.
[6517.37s -> 6520.65s]  That would be that would suck shaping up nicely.

[6544.36s -> 6545.48s]  Seven thousand bucks.
[6546.20s -> 6550.27s]  That's how you make a blame.
[6550.27s -> 6552.08s]  Am I about to just make like 10 grand?
[6552.08s -> 6553.60s]  I'm going to buy a bunch of houses and stuff.
[6553.60s -> 6559.04s]  He's addicted.
[6559.04s -> 6559.20s]  Yeah.
[6559.20s -> 6560.16s]  I'm addicted to money.
[6561.42s -> 6562.30s]  I have 1500.
[6562.30s -> 6565.82s]  I want to have like 10 grand and I'm going to go buy like a really cool wand.
[6566.38s -> 6581.84s]  How many there's five levels.
[6582.56s -> 6586.28s]  This is going to take like 30 minutes.
[6587.00s -> 6589.45s]  No, it's no one.
[6590.52s -> 6591.64s]  I'm just going to do up to level.
[6592.84s -> 6594.84s]  I'm just going to get to the next level and that's it.
[6594.84s -> 6597.56s]  I'm going to go meet Teresa after I buy some new clothes.
[6597.56s -> 6599.34s]  I'm going to go buy a bunch of food.
[6599.34s -> 6600.14s]  I want to get fat too.
[6600.14s -> 6601.26s]  Like, of course, I'm going to do that.
[6601.26s -> 6602.78s]  If you're going to give me the opportunity to do that, you know,
[6602.78s -> 6604.54s]  I'm not going to be like the fat guy in the game.
[6604.54s -> 6605.34s]  Are you serious?
[6605.34s -> 6606.60s]  Why would I not do that?
[6611.79s -> 6617.16s]  I'm going to be like a big fat magician.
[6623.48s -> 6626.36s]  Oh, by the way, I got weighed recently at the doctor.
[6626.92s -> 6628.88s]  I'm 161 pounds.
[6629.44s -> 6631.84s]  I'm gaining and I'm gaining.
[6632.57s -> 6633.53s]  I've got to cut it down.
[6633.53s -> 6639.18s]  I've got to like, I got to change the diet a little bit, I think.
[6639.18s -> 6640.06s]  We don't care.
[6640.06s -> 6640.70s]  I do.
[6640.70s -> 6641.82s]  So I'm going to tell you about it.
[6647.74s -> 6648.70s]  I almost blew it.
[6648.70s -> 6652.35s]  Why are you telling us this?
[6652.91s -> 6654.08s]  I don't know.
[6654.88s -> 6656.24s]  Hey, but yeah, you screwed me up.
[6656.24s -> 6656.64s]  What do you mean?
[6657.28s -> 6658.40s]  Why wouldn't I tell you this?
[6658.96s -> 6661.42s]  What is this like stream?
[6661.42s -> 6664.22s]  I'm just, I'm going to tell you stuff that happens in my life.
[6664.78s -> 6675.96s]  You choked.
[6675.96s -> 6679.96s]  Yeah, because I'm talking about how fat I am and somebody said I don't even care.
[6679.96s -> 6681.96s]  And I'm like, well, I care how fat I'm getting.
[6682.68s -> 6687.16s]  No, I'm all screwed up now.
[6687.16s -> 6689.32s]  I'll get it.
[6689.32s -> 6698.99s]  I just checked your BMI.
[6698.99s -> 6701.07s]  Yeah, my BMI is probably like 70 or something.
[6715.23s -> 6716.03s]  70.
[6716.03s -> 6718.59s]  Yeah, 70 would be, I'd be made out of like butter.
[6723.26s -> 6727.02s]  I'm not even sure that butter has a 70% BMI.
[6727.02s -> 6741.20s]  BMI is body mass index.
[6747.32s -> 6750.92s]  Yeah, it's a nice fancy fucking thing that guys with the big fancy degrees
[6750.92s -> 6752.76s]  tell you to stop eating Doritos every day.
[6752.76s -> 6753.88s]  Okay, sure.
[6767.60s -> 6769.92s]  Oh, that, look, that was, that was fucked up.
[6770.48s -> 6771.20s]  That was fucked up.
[6771.20s -> 6772.00s]  You see that?
[6772.00s -> 6775.42s]  The FPS, it like skipped.
[6775.42s -> 6791.76s]  Remember, if you're 10 pounds overweight, you win.
[6791.76s -> 6791.92s]  What?
[6793.53s -> 6795.53s]  I believe I'm like five pounds overweight.
[6796.65s -> 6797.53s]  Which I can fix that.
[6797.53s -> 6797.93s]  That's easy.
[6797.93s -> 6799.79s]  I'll just, it'll be fine.
[6811.23s -> 6814.51s]  Running for my prostate exam was a, wait, what?
[6815.23s -> 6816.17s]  Just go in.
[6829.20s -> 6831.84s]  All right, I'm almost, I'm, I'm, I'm, my multipliers are getting pretty good.
[6831.84s -> 6832.32s]  This will be fine.
[6833.68s -> 6834.40s]  Don't screw it up.
[6835.04s -> 6838.04s]  144.
[6838.04s -> 6838.44s]  Let's go.
[6839.32s -> 6839.88s]  Five grand.
[6850.35s -> 6850.99s]  God damn it.
[6850.99s -> 6851.31s]  All right.
[6851.31s -> 6851.47s]  Wow.
[6851.47s -> 6852.67s]  That was a complete fake.
[6852.67s -> 6853.79s]  That was a total.
[6853.79s -> 6854.67s]  I should not have gotten that.
[6854.67s -> 6855.95s]  It was not even in the green, not even close.
[6870.01s -> 6871.29s]  I need to do 30 more.
[6871.93s -> 6875.60s]  No, I don't mean 30.
[6875.60s -> 6876.08s]  Fuck.
[6876.08s -> 6876.48s]  All right.
[6876.48s -> 6877.68s]  That guy fucked with me.
[6877.68s -> 6878.16s]  Whatever.
[6878.16s -> 6878.96s]  I'm done.
[6878.96s -> 6887.66s]  All right.
[6887.66s -> 6888.62s]  This Teresa.
[6888.62s -> 6889.34s]  All right, Teresa.
[6889.34s -> 6889.66s]  I'm here.
[6900.62s -> 6901.98s]  All the places you've been.
[6901.98s -> 6903.10s]  The people you've known.
[6903.10s -> 6903.42s]  Okay.
[6903.42s -> 6903.98s]  Up and down.
[6903.98s -> 6904.54s]  Everything you've done.
[6905.34s -> 6906.06s]  Make comments.
[6906.06s -> 6907.26s]  How many moments?
[6907.26s -> 6908.30s]  How many memories?
[6909.64s -> 6910.60s]  Fag and his men.
[6911.32s -> 6912.36s]  They had just as many.
[6913.16s -> 6914.64s]  And now they have none.
[6915.20s -> 6915.92s]  Because of you.
[6916.64s -> 6919.52s]  Do you feel the weight of responsibility yet?
[6919.52s -> 6920.02s]  No.
[6920.64s -> 6924.16s]  You will get used to the burden as all heroes must.
[6924.16s -> 6928.99s]  The world is better off without Fag.
[6928.99s -> 6930.91s]  And certainly Bower Lake is in your debt.
[6931.87s -> 6934.60s]  But to really see the impact of your actions.
[6934.60s -> 6936.68s]  You need look no further than Bower's town.
[6936.68s -> 6937.40s]  Consequences?
[6937.40s -> 6938.04s]  Uh oh.
[6938.04s -> 6939.96s]  It has changed much since you lived here.
[6940.52s -> 6942.84s]  Particularly old town where you spent your childhood.
[6942.84s -> 6945.80s]  I almost just pressed triangle and just shot that lady with a crossbow.
[6945.80s -> 6948.68s]  Even the simplest choice can have far reaching consequences.
[6955.82s -> 6957.10s]  That's going to happen eventually.
[6957.10s -> 6957.58s]  I know it is.
[6958.22s -> 6961.48s]  Oh, it's my old can.
[6961.48s -> 6962.04s]  Whatever this is.
[6962.04s -> 6963.64s]  That is where Lucian is now.
[6963.64s -> 6965.76s]  Hattered spire.
[6965.76s -> 6966.32s]  Where?
[6966.32s -> 6971.20s]  I thought it was in the moon.
[6971.92s -> 6979.28s]  The spire was intended as a conduit granting the kingdom's ruler a power so great
[6979.28s -> 6981.60s]  he could bend reality to his will.
[6981.60s -> 6984.46s]  The day it was completed.
[6985.26s -> 6986.78s]  And the first wish made.
[6987.82s -> 6989.42s]  A light bloomed inside.
[6989.98s -> 6992.67s]  Though its nature could not have been darker.
[6992.67s -> 6996.27s]  Being shattered.
[6999.84s -> 7002.88s]  Centuries of civilization were wiped out in moments.
[7002.88s -> 7004.96s]  Its people erased from existence.
[7004.96s -> 7007.52s]  Some say that this was the first wish.
[7007.52s -> 7010.00s]  An end to a hollow and corrupt world.
[7010.08s -> 7012.00s]  And for a purer one to take its place.
[7017.66s -> 7022.52s]  And now the spire rises once again.
[7022.52s -> 7025.88s]  Lucian found documents which foretold the coming of one
[7025.88s -> 7027.56s]  who would stop him using the spire.
[7029.88s -> 7031.32s]  That is why your sister died.
[7032.52s -> 7033.96s]  And that is why you will face him.
[7034.52s -> 7036.68s]  The cards have shown me this.
[7038.03s -> 7042.86s]  Here, take a look.
[7042.86s -> 7043.66s]  Eight cards.
[7044.46s -> 7047.34s]  Each of the three heroes you see in the cards
[7047.34s -> 7050.14s]  is a step on the hidden path to Lucian's downfall.
[7051.37s -> 7055.53s]  And the life force of heroes will itself is the key to the spire.
[7055.53s -> 7056.49s]  Why is he running?
[7056.49s -> 7057.61s]  Wait, what?
[7057.61s -> 7060.65s]  Lucian's agents scour the land even as we speak.
[7061.84s -> 7065.28s]  You must find the three heroes before Lucian does.
[7065.28s -> 7066.80s]  Because you are the fourth.
[7066.80s -> 7068.96s]  The one who will bring his downfall.
[7068.96s -> 7072.41s]  I have seen a vision of a holy ritual in Oakfield.
[7073.98s -> 7077.98s]  Salvation, though bittersweet, is delivered by one of incredible strength.
[7078.70s -> 7083.40s]  Speak to the abbot at the temple of light
[7083.40s -> 7085.16s]  and see what you can learn of this pilgrim.
[7087.31s -> 7089.07s]  The road to Oakfield will be dangerous.
[7089.07s -> 7090.67s]  You saw the poop in your pants?
[7090.67s -> 7091.55s]  Good luck.
[7091.55s -> 7093.23s]  How would you have seen the poop in my pants?
[7096.70s -> 7097.58s]  All right, I have money.
[7097.58s -> 7098.70s]  I want to buy some stuff.
[7099.34s -> 7102.99s]  What's that?
[7102.99s -> 7108.11s]  Oh, shit, look at this.
[7108.11s -> 7110.03s]  By Richard the Stonecutter.
[7111.71s -> 7113.07s]  Final price, $5,500.
[7113.63s -> 7118.54s]  I buy this?
[7123.68s -> 7124.40s]  Kill the owner.
[7128.92s -> 7129.40s]  Where is he?
[7129.96s -> 7133.48s]  Kill the owner?
[7150.32s -> 7151.28s]  Eliminate that guy.
[7152.33s -> 7153.93s]  All right, so if I tell somebody to follow me
[7154.57s -> 7156.09s]  and then I walk them into a bunch of bandits
[7156.09s -> 7156.89s]  and they just get killed.
[7158.14s -> 7159.02s]  I am not...
[7159.02s -> 7161.50s]  I don't kill them so I don't get bad person points
[7161.50s -> 7162.86s]  but I can just take the money that's on them
[7162.86s -> 7163.90s]  and then buy their empty house.
[7164.86s -> 7165.50s]  Is that accurate?
[7171.66s -> 7172.14s]  Pretty evil.
[7184.86s -> 7186.14s]  Sounds like a serial killer.
[7188.73s -> 7190.80s]  You're better off just being pure evil.
[7191.68s -> 7193.60s]  No, but then I don't get the benefits of being good.
[7196.01s -> 7196.73s]  Which, by the way,
[7197.37s -> 7198.89s]  what are the benefits of being good?
[7198.89s -> 7200.89s]  I've never done it in any one of these video games.
[7202.11s -> 7203.79s]  I always accidentally just like
[7204.51s -> 7206.51s]  start murdering people in the towns
[7206.51s -> 7208.27s]  and I've never seen what a good playthrough is.
[7212.51s -> 7212.91s]  Never.
[7218.20s -> 7219.48s]  You look less ugly.
[7221.24s -> 7221.80s]  Is that it?
[7224.99s -> 7226.11s]  Just less ugly?
[7226.75s -> 7230.83s]  People will constantly want to marry you.
[7232.91s -> 7240.78s]  I guess that is a little annoying.
[7240.78s -> 7242.14s]  There we go, I've got a good multiplier here.
[7250.24s -> 7251.36s]  New sword, what do you think?
[7256.35s -> 7257.23s]  $250, let's go.
[7267.76s -> 7268.00s]  Thanks.
[7269.29s -> 7270.33s]  Ooh, that was risky.
[7272.64s -> 7277.39s]  Evil is funner.
[7277.39s -> 7278.43s]  I missed, but it's okay.
[7281.40s -> 7283.24s]  I mean, evil is always gonna be funner
[7283.24s -> 7285.24s]  because I can just walk into a store
[7285.24s -> 7286.28s]  and just take everything.
[7286.92s -> 7288.20s]  I don't even need money.
[7288.20s -> 7289.72s]  I can just kill the guy behind the register
[7289.72s -> 7292.04s]  and take everything in the fucking store.
[7292.04s -> 7302.78s]  Of course it's funner and easier.
[7302.78s -> 7305.02s]  There's good, evil, and then pure and corrupt.
[7307.88s -> 7309.56s]  Should I be good and corrupt?
[7310.44s -> 7311.72s]  Or evil and pure?
[7311.72s -> 7312.76s]  What does that even mean?
[7312.76s -> 7324.72s]  Evil and pure?
[7324.72s -> 7326.32s]  Pure evil.
[7326.32s -> 7326.96s]  Oh, I see.
[7328.22s -> 7331.42s]  Oh, that was a mistake.
[7331.42s -> 7335.76s]  It means evil and vegetarian.
[7337.52s -> 7338.92s]  I fucked it up.
[7338.92s -> 7340.12s]  Yeah, I got too greedy.
[7340.12s -> 7340.76s]  It's all right.
[7340.76s -> 7344.96s]  Should I just be an evil vegan?
[7344.96s -> 7346.24s]  No, I won't be able to get fat.
[7350.75s -> 7358.41s]  Should I be a fat vegan?
[7358.41s -> 7366.83s]  How is a lawful vegan?
[7373.50s -> 7376.62s]  I don't know why that's making me laugh.
[7376.62s -> 7377.34s]  I don't know why.
[7377.34s -> 7379.18s]  Because you could be fat anything.
[7379.18s -> 7383.39s]  It's just based on calories and fat content.
[7387.71s -> 7389.47s]  You know how to use a hammer.
[7389.47s -> 7403.23s]  Yeah, I'm going to be a good, fat, pure, evil, vegetarian.
[7403.23s -> 7417.93s]  All right, almost there.
[7423.23s -> 7425.47s]  Good fatty acids only.
[7425.47s -> 7429.66s]  That's how you make a blade.
[7429.66s -> 7431.18s]  Damn it, I was reading chat.
[7431.18s -> 7432.06s]  Shit, I was so...
[7432.86s -> 7435.16s]  I'm almost done.
[7436.44s -> 7437.32s]  I'm almost done, please.
[7446.44s -> 7449.96s]  Yeah, I'm going to be chaotic, monounsaturated fat.
[7450.68s -> 7454.70s]  Holy shit, that was awful.
[7454.70s -> 7455.82s]  What was I doing?
[7455.82s -> 7462.70s]  Nice bit of forging.
[7462.70s -> 7470.97s]  All right, almost done.
[7472.00s -> 7473.36s]  I promise I'm not going to do this.
[7473.36s -> 7474.08s]  I need money though.
[7480.65s -> 7481.77s]  Jeremy, this is too much.
[7483.82s -> 7485.66s]  I'm just playing a blacksmithing mini-game.
[7487.53s -> 7489.21s]  I'm not electrocuting your seat.
[7491.90s -> 7501.84s]  Oh shit, I didn't even test if the audio was synced.
[7501.84s -> 7502.88s]  I'm almost done.
[7502.88s -> 7503.77s]  Everybody relax.
[7505.61s -> 7516.94s]  I'm doing this now because I wanted to do this later.
[7519.10s -> 7520.46s]  You know, you realize if I do this now,
[7520.46s -> 7523.10s]  then it's a super simple way for me to make a bunch of money later.
[7537.98s -> 7539.34s]  Every time you hit the hammer wrong,
[7539.34s -> 7541.74s]  I receive one-fifth of a lethal injection.
[7542.70s -> 7546.24s]  I really hate to tell you,
[7546.24s -> 7550.40s]  but one-fifth of a lethal injection is a lethal injection.
[7550.40s -> 7550.88s]  You're gone.
[7551.68s -> 7553.37s]  There's no such thing as that, I'm sorry.
[7569.29s -> 7570.17s]  That dude's dead.
[7570.17s -> 7570.65s]  No, he's not.
[7570.65s -> 7571.29s]  I haven't missed.
[7577.08s -> 7579.39s]  All right, there we go.
[7579.39s -> 7579.79s]  We're good.
[7580.51s -> 7581.95s]  Now we're going to go till I lose.
[7582.59s -> 7591.63s]  What's going on?
[7592.27s -> 7601.47s]  Just go until you lose because this is a ton of money.
[7602.03s -> 7607.48s]  Next level, not yet, not yet.
[7607.48s -> 7609.39s]  All right, now we're done.
[7609.39s -> 7609.71s]  We're done.
[7609.71s -> 7610.75s]  I got 9,500 bucks.
[7610.75s -> 7611.63s]  Time to get some more equipment.
[7611.63s -> 7613.15s]  I want a better outfit.
[7613.95s -> 7614.99s]  I'm going to eat a shitload of food.
[7615.55s -> 7629.05s]  I got a good bunch of stuff.
[7629.05s -> 7630.64s]  Yeah, let's eat.
[7630.64s -> 7635.34s]  All right, let's have some fucking mutton.
[7635.34s -> 7635.74s]  Ugly.
[7637.90s -> 7639.66s]  Okay, what if they don't see me gain weight?
[7639.66s -> 7642.09s]  What if I just show up later and I'm fat?
[7642.09s -> 7653.39s]  They won't see like me turning fat.
[7653.39s -> 7661.52s]  Tomato juice, chicken fried mutton.
[7661.52s -> 7663.12s]  No, I can't give you any of this.
[7663.12s -> 7668.11s]  Wait, that kid just says school gives me too much homework.
[7668.11s -> 7669.23s]  Dude, you do have school.
[7669.23s -> 7677.45s]  Does getting fat make you slower?
[7678.01s -> 7687.74s]  Okay, now we go drink a bunch of beer.
[7687.74s -> 7693.98s]  Is there a way I can see how fat I am?
[7700.33s -> 7708.86s]  Look, look in a mirror.
[7708.86s -> 7717.60s]  No, I'm talking about like, holy shit, what's going on?
[7717.60s -> 7724.54s]  I just got, I want more like bread.
[7724.54s -> 7725.02s]  Here we go.
[7725.95s -> 7726.35s]  Pies.
[7726.99s -> 7727.93s]  This will do it.
[7728.73s -> 7730.25s]  Oh yeah, you better believe it.
[7730.25s -> 7731.69s]  All right, give me some apple pies.
[7733.68s -> 7742.38s]  Beef pie, country beef pie, crab apple pie, kidney and friends pie, crumbly pie.
[7742.38s -> 7742.86s]  Let's go.
[7743.98s -> 7756.00s]  Okay, crumbly and friends pie.
[7756.88s -> 7760.41s]  I'm leveling up.
[7762.09s -> 7762.65s]  Oh, thanks.
[7763.37s -> 7767.66s]  This is the shame corner.
[7773.52s -> 7774.88s]  I'm leveling up by eating.
[7774.88s -> 7775.52s]  This is great.
[7775.52s -> 7776.72s]  Okay, crab apple pie.
[7778.32s -> 7779.20s]  Well, get out of here.
[7779.20s -> 7780.16s]  You're not supposed to be watching me.
[7780.16s -> 7781.12s]  Stop watching me eat.
[7781.12s -> 7782.40s]  Get the fuck away from me.
[7782.40s -> 7785.12s]  Let me eat in peace.
[7785.12s -> 7796.03s]  What?
[7796.03s -> 7807.12s]  Is this as big as I can get?
[7807.12s -> 7808.08s]  How big can I get?
[7808.08s -> 7809.76s]  I've gotten a little bigger, haven't I?
[7809.76s -> 7821.04s]  Apple pie pocket.
[7821.04s -> 7823.40s]  Your love for food and your aversion to exercise
[7823.40s -> 7825.56s]  have earned you the right to be called salad dodger.
[7838.14s -> 7838.94s]  Salad dodger?
[7838.94s -> 7840.38s]  Okay, country blueberry pie.
[7841.18s -> 7843.08s]  What was that?
[7843.08s -> 7844.04s]  Why did I just freak out?
[7844.60s -> 7846.24s]  I almost tried flirting with you.
[7848.14s -> 7849.18s]  All right, let's flirt.
[7858.86s -> 7859.42s]  She's happy.
[7860.22s -> 7862.62s]  Oh my god, I have gained a lot of weight, haven't I?
[7873.68s -> 7874.64s]  I need more food.
[7875.92s -> 7878.24s]  Is there like a way I can tell how big I am?
[7908.54s -> 7909.34s]  What about Zaffer?
[7909.34s -> 7910.70s]  I'm getting close to just hitting...
[7910.70s -> 7912.14s]  I'm just getting close to zapping this lady.
[7914.65s -> 7918.49s]  What do you sell?
[7918.49s -> 7919.05s]  Steel.
[7919.05s -> 7922.35s]  Wait, I can be a good person and steal.
[7922.35s -> 7924.59s]  Don't call yourself the dump.
[7924.59s -> 7925.07s]  Dump?
[7925.07s -> 7926.43s]  I'm not serving you.
[7926.43s -> 7927.87s]  Not nicely anyway.
[7927.87s -> 7928.11s]  What?
[7929.28s -> 7930.48s]  7% markup?
[7931.20s -> 7939.98s]  No, look, it's the dump.
[7942.08s -> 7944.16s]  Okay, how do I just take things?
[7944.80s -> 7947.08s]  I can be a good person and steal furniture.
[7947.72s -> 7958.28s]  Wait, is this guy rated?
[7958.28s -> 7958.92s]  Who's rated?
[7961.60s -> 7962.80s]  Oh, it's San rated.
[7962.80s -> 7963.44s]  Oh shit.
[7964.81s -> 7965.85s]  What's going on, everybody?
[7971.85s -> 7972.49s]  Thanks, San.
[7972.49s -> 7972.81s]  Welcome.
[7974.48s -> 7975.44s]  Welcome to the stream.
[7976.08s -> 7979.85s]  That's a lot of people.
[7981.93s -> 7982.65s]  Thanks a lot, dude.
[7984.24s -> 7984.88s]  Raid song?
[7984.88s -> 7986.24s]  I don't have a raid song.
[7986.24s -> 7986.80s]  I don't.
[7986.80s -> 7987.36s]  I can't.
[7987.36s -> 7989.20s]  There's too many people to embarrass myself in front of.
[7994.11s -> 7997.08s]  If you're just joining, I'm playing Fable 2.
[7998.09s -> 8003.29s]  I'm in the middle of trying to make my guy very large and strong and heavy.
[8003.29s -> 8008.97s]  I'm just feeding him.
[8008.97s -> 8011.21s]  He's a magic user and now we're going to go do the quest.
[8012.64s -> 8013.92s]  Thanks for the huge raid, dude.
[8013.92s -> 8014.96s]  Welcome, everybody.
[8014.96s -> 8016.72s]  I'm a pretty normal guy.
[8016.72s -> 8018.08s]  I'm pretty like...
[8018.08s -> 8019.76s]  You know, I'm kind of, you know, I'm normal.
[8019.76s -> 8020.48s]  I don't...
[8020.48s -> 8021.04s]  Whatever.
[8021.04s -> 8021.84s]  All right, thanks for coming.
[8022.97s -> 8023.93s]  I don't know what to say.
[8023.93s -> 8024.81s]  That's so many people.
[8024.81s -> 8026.17s]  Can I steal, please?
[8026.17s -> 8030.33s]  Okay, how do I turn this person around?
[8032.52s -> 8033.48s]  Oh shit, here we go.
[8033.48s -> 8036.40s]  All right, I want to buy clothes.
[8036.40s -> 8036.96s]  Here we go.
[8036.96s -> 8041.00s]  Can I buy a wig?
[8041.00s -> 8044.09s]  All right, I'm going to buy the Mickey Mouse gloves.
[8048.28s -> 8052.38s]  And I want to...
[8053.02s -> 8053.82s]  An eye patch?
[8053.82s -> 8054.38s]  No.
[8054.38s -> 8054.94s]  How about...
[8054.94s -> 8056.14s]  Okay, how about like the...
[8056.14s -> 8057.50s]  Yeah, I'm going to do like a wrestler mask.
[8062.91s -> 8063.63s]  And these things.
[8064.35s -> 8065.39s]  Yeah, definitely these.
[8068.06s -> 8069.50s]  Oh, the wizard hat's awesome, too.
[8071.69s -> 8072.57s]  Can I get a wizard hat?
[8072.57s -> 8073.45s]  Yes, I need the wizard hat.
[8073.45s -> 8074.33s]  Of course I do.
[8074.33s -> 8090.40s]  Okay, I want headgear.
[8090.40s -> 8092.00s]  Can I not wear the mask and the...
[8092.64s -> 8093.12s]  Yeah, I can wear...
[8093.12s -> 8098.19s]  Can I wear them both?
[8098.19s -> 8098.91s]  Really?
[8098.91s -> 8106.89s]  Okay, I like those.
[8106.89s -> 8107.21s]  Mask.
[8107.21s -> 8109.68s]  Here we go.
[8109.68s -> 8116.60s]  Oh, I have to have some...
[8116.60s -> 8117.48s]  I have to wear something up here.
[8117.48s -> 8118.60s]  How about like the big gown?
[8122.12s -> 8124.12s]  Wow, I'm attractive.
[8124.12s -> 8124.84s]  What?
[8124.84s -> 8125.48s]  Afraid of me?
[8135.24s -> 8136.76s]  Yeah, the Archmage robes.
[8136.76s -> 8137.48s]  That's perfect.
[8139.61s -> 8140.11s]  Okay.
[8142.81s -> 8143.31s]  Perfect.
[8143.95s -> 8146.14s]  What do you think of me now?
[8147.66s -> 8148.16s]  Thank you.
[8152.10s -> 8153.30s]  Robe and wizard hat.
[8154.74s -> 8155.30s]  Not yet.
[8155.30s -> 8156.10s]  I like how this looks.
[8159.94s -> 8161.06s]  You were about to steal from a villager.
[8161.06s -> 8161.70s]  This is a crime.
[8161.70s -> 8163.62s]  The eye icon tells you if anyone can see you.
[8181.07s -> 8181.87s]  The perfect crime.
[8181.87s -> 8184.29s]  The dog distracts them.
[8184.29s -> 8188.54s]  It was four gold?
[8188.54s -> 8189.18s]  28 grand.
[8189.18s -> 8197.10s]  All right, I'm gonna do a mission.
[8197.10s -> 8197.90s]  Bad boy time.
[8197.90s -> 8200.70s]  Yeah, we're big good picture, bad small picture.
[8200.70s -> 8202.58s]  That means I can steal from registers.
[8202.58s -> 8207.79s]  That means I can punch people in the face if I don't like them at all.
[8208.67s -> 8211.55s]  But I'm gonna be a good person in the grand scheme of things.
[8212.11s -> 8217.22s]  Stealing $40 from the register, but I'm gonna like save the town.
[8226.40s -> 8229.52s]  See?
[8240.66s -> 8242.58s]  I'm gonna shock somebody accidentally.
[8242.58s -> 8243.70s]  Does the game save itself?
[8247.79s -> 8248.75s]  Chaotic Hungary.
[8261.97s -> 8262.61s]  Oh, shit.
[8262.61s -> 8263.01s]  Thank you.
[8271.97s -> 8272.37s]  Thank you.
[8272.37s -> 8272.85s]  Have a good day.
[8274.45s -> 8274.85s]  I will.
[8275.81s -> 8276.53s]  I appreciate that.
[8276.53s -> 8277.33s]  Thanks for the discount.
[8281.20s -> 8281.76s]  Digspot.
[8284.29s -> 8285.09s]  Where's our digspot?
[8285.09s -> 8285.49s]  Over here?
[8286.13s -> 8288.05s]  Where is it?
[8288.05s -> 8291.41s]  Where is it?
[8291.41s -> 8295.82s]  Where's the digspot?
[8295.82s -> 8300.82s]  Is this illegal?
[8307.87s -> 8309.41s]  Um, what the hell is going on?
[8316.30s -> 8317.42s]  Is it because safety's on?
[8317.42s -> 8317.98s]  Oh, okay.
[8321.07s -> 8326.00s]  Oh, by the way, I want to make it clear again.
[8326.00s -> 8329.28s]  Uh, don't miss the stream next weekend on Sunday.
[8329.28s -> 8330.72s]  Percival peanuts?
[8330.72s -> 8333.38s]  Okay.
[8335.18s -> 8335.90s]  All right, what do you want?
[8340.99s -> 8342.91s]  Oh, they they know that I'm the swordsman.
[8342.91s -> 8343.41s]  Okay.
[8348.66s -> 8349.86s]  Am I streaming Saturday too?
[8349.86s -> 8350.36s]  I am not.
[8353.76s -> 8356.48s]  I am streaming tomorrow, but next Saturday, no.
[8356.48s -> 8357.36s]  Next Sunday only.
[8359.76s -> 8361.12s]  All right, let's go find this guy.
[8361.12s -> 8368.19s]  I need to level up.
[8368.19s -> 8369.07s]  How do I level up?
[8369.07s -> 8371.30s]  Do I have to go to like the guild thing?
[8380.88s -> 8381.44s]  Surprising.
[8381.44s -> 8382.96s]  You gained 200 pounds.
[8382.96s -> 8383.84s]  Just drink it right now.
[8387.54s -> 8388.50s]  Nice job.
[8388.50s -> 8390.99s]  You found me ground wine.
[8390.99s -> 8393.71s]  Can I open this?
[8393.71s -> 8396.00s]  Is it five?
[8396.00s -> 8410.90s]  Oh, damn it.
[8410.90s -> 8412.58s]  Wait, you're streaming next Sunday?
[8412.58s -> 8417.23s]  Well, this channel is going to be live, but it's not...
[8417.23s -> 8418.51s]  It's not going to be me streaming.
[8419.15s -> 8420.61s]  I have to...
[8421.34s -> 8422.78s]  It's a whole lore deal.
[8422.78s -> 8425.39s]  All right, what do I want here?
[8425.39s -> 8428.50s]  Chaos?
[8432.66s -> 8433.78s]  Or just shock 2?
[8437.38s -> 8440.72s]  I think I want chaos.
[8441.78s -> 8444.82s]  Chaos confuses your foes, making them unpredictable.
[8445.90s -> 8446.94s]  You've learned the chaos spell.
[8446.94s -> 8449.42s]  Summon a mask of madness to scramble the minds of your enemies,
[8449.42s -> 8450.70s]  and you never know what might happen.
[8451.26s -> 8453.26s]  Cast your spell wide to catch more enemies.
[8453.26s -> 8453.90s]  Okay.
[8453.90s -> 8455.58s]  How do I select which one I want to use?
[8455.58s -> 8461.65s]  I can do time as well?
[8461.65s -> 8464.61s]  Time control allows you to slow the world around you,
[8464.61s -> 8466.37s]  or to move with incredible speed.
[8466.37s -> 8467.41s]  Oh, I can buy this too.
[8467.41s -> 8468.61s]  No, I'll save it.
[8468.61s -> 8470.38s]  I don't need it.
[8470.38s -> 8473.66s]  Extra style accuracy speed.
[8474.22s -> 8478.66s]  The greater your speed, the faster you will be able to unleash it.
[8478.66s -> 8479.54s]  Oh, I can learn roll.
[8479.54s -> 8480.02s]  I want this.
[8480.98s -> 8482.54s]  Tap A while moving.
[8482.54s -> 8483.18s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8483.18s -> 8484.46s]  That's a huge deal.
[8484.46s -> 8484.94s]  I need it.
[8488.48s -> 8490.08s]  And physique?
[8490.80s -> 8493.42s]  Upness?
[8493.42s -> 8493.98s]  There we go.
[8494.70s -> 8495.49s]  More health.
[8496.05s -> 8504.58s]  When there is a sail on, the thing will flash.
[8504.58s -> 8505.22s]  Press it now.
[8508.22s -> 8508.78s]  Sails.
[8509.50s -> 8511.25s]  Blacksmith sail?
[8511.97s -> 8514.21s]  Oh shit.
[8514.21s -> 8516.11s]  Oh my god.
[8517.33s -> 8523.01s]  All right, let's go.
[8523.01s -> 8524.53s]  How do I select the spell?
[8526.21s -> 8529.39s]  Is there a way I can select the spell?
[8530.03s -> 8532.90s]  Left bumper?
[8539.22s -> 8539.46s]  B?
[8541.14s -> 8541.70s]  Watch out, dog.
[8543.57s -> 8543.97s]  Hold B.
[8544.85s -> 8559.66s]  Push down on the D-pad well with a weapon drawn
[8559.66s -> 8561.98s]  while facing a potential victim to turn off safety mode.
[8574.21s -> 8575.09s]  Okay, so this is a bad guy.
[8583.68s -> 8584.40s]  Oh, all right.
[8585.20s -> 8587.07s]  Is it bad?
[8592.91s -> 8595.15s]  Oh, that's nice, that is.
[8596.48s -> 8598.56s]  I'm sure they'd want you to have it.
[8600.08s -> 8607.31s]  Is that evil?
[8607.31s -> 8608.90s]  That guy was a bad guy.
[8609.54s -> 8615.09s]  That was a bad guy.
[8615.81s -> 8620.18s]  He probably ran him off the road.
[8620.18s -> 8620.90s]  That was a lie.
[8621.54s -> 8625.47s]  Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8625.47s -> 8627.23s]  Saint Peter can fucking judge that guy, okay?
[8627.23s -> 8628.75s]  See, you can go up and Saint Peter can judge him.
[8628.75s -> 8629.07s]  Not me.
[8631.50s -> 8631.82s]  Ow.
[8638.34s -> 8638.82s]  Crossbow?
[8638.82s -> 8641.86s]  Who needs a fucking crossbow when I got unlimited power?
[8658.80s -> 8660.00s]  Oh shit, give me that stuff.
[8660.00s -> 8667.68s]  Damn it.
[8667.68s -> 8679.14s]  Give me it.
[8680.66s -> 8685.44s]  All right, let's do chaos.
[8688.94s -> 8690.38s]  Hey, who is it?
[8690.94s -> 8695.57s]  Whatever, they can't even hit me.
[8696.78s -> 8697.98s]  One spell, Andy.
[8697.98s -> 8698.86s]  It's effective.
[8698.86s -> 8699.98s]  It's a really good spell.
[8704.27s -> 8705.31s]  Oh, I like that one.
[8706.11s -> 8708.16s]  That one, I feel like I should be like,
[8708.16s -> 8713.97s]  Avada Kedavra.
[8713.97s -> 8715.01s]  What does he say?
[8715.01s -> 8725.49s]  Avada Kedavra, okay.
[8734.37s -> 8735.89s]  Let's fight each other, who cares?
[8743.87s -> 8744.99s]  Is he even doing anything?
[8745.63s -> 8749.15s]  The spell sucks.
[8749.79s -> 8756.42s]  What am I even doing here?
[8757.06s -> 8761.10s]  Why would I do that when I could just do this?
[8761.66s -> 8772.58s]  Everybody fight.
[8772.58s -> 8774.06s]  What just happened?
[8774.06s -> 8774.30s]  What?
[8774.94s -> 8779.36s]  Doctor Strange?
[8779.92s -> 8789.28s]  All right, fight each other.
[8789.28s -> 8790.64s]  What are they all standing around for?
[8801.38s -> 8803.30s]  Am I even fighting bad people here right now?
[8803.94s -> 8816.40s]  No, no, no, no, I don't want to fall.
[8816.40s -> 8817.44s]  I want his stuff.
[8817.44s -> 8819.50s]  Is he dead?
[8819.50s -> 8820.70s]  Oh, fuck.
[8820.70s -> 8823.46s]  Oh, God, no.
[8831.26s -> 8833.22s]  That's what I want.
[8833.22s -> 8834.66s]  I want to confuse him then shoot him in the head.
[8835.46s -> 8839.74s]  All right, that ability is terrible.
[8840.46s -> 8850.66s]  I got to go to bed?
[8850.66s -> 8852.90s]  Well, have a great sleep, man.
[8852.90s -> 8854.02s]  Thanks for watching.
[8854.02s -> 8856.14s]  Hopefully, we see you maybe tomorrow.
[8856.14s -> 8858.16s]  And we'll see you tomorrow.
[8858.16s -> 8862.06s]  If not, then I really hope we see you on next Sunday.
[8870.59s -> 8872.59s]  Oh, the dog's book of war.
[8872.59s -> 8878.58s]  The dog is now a two-star fighter.
[8878.58s -> 8879.14s]  Oh, nice.
[8879.14s -> 8879.38s]  Okay.
[8891.17s -> 8925.52s]  Okay, he reacted to it.
[8925.52s -> 8931.86s]  I'm trying to go like right in his face.
[8931.86s -> 8944.06s]  How come he's not getting up?
[8944.70s -> 8952.51s]  What is going on?
[8975.87s -> 8977.15s]  All right, that was the last brawl.
[8977.15s -> 8978.75s]  We're going to ignore this guy.
[8978.75s -> 8980.75s]  He shit in my face.
[8980.75s -> 8982.91s]  He shit his pants in my face and that was it.
[8982.91s -> 8984.19s]  I'm not going to fucking stand for that.
[8984.99s -> 8986.37s]  Oh, my God.
[8986.37s -> 8987.97s]  They're kicking the shit out of me.
[8987.97s -> 9001.92s]  Oh, eat this.
[9001.92s -> 9008.48s]  Okay.
[9009.04s -> 9011.52s]  Oh, what do you got?
[9011.52s -> 9012.08s]  Dig spot?
[9012.08s -> 9015.18s]  Let's go.
[9015.18s -> 9016.06s]  And a treasure right here.
[9016.06s -> 9016.78s]  This game is fun.
[9019.12s -> 9021.60s]  This game is really not that hard, but whatever we do is fun.
[9021.60s -> 9028.35s]  Oh, money.
[9028.35s -> 9034.91s]  That was a real fart fecal funny moment.
[9034.91s -> 9043.07s]  Well, it's guaranteed comedy.
[9043.07s -> 9043.87s]  Hide snout.
[9044.61s -> 9047.01s]  Your dog can now hide his snout to see him do it.
[9047.01s -> 9047.89s]  Belcher fart.
[9048.45s -> 9049.89s]  Well, I have to do it.
[9049.89s -> 9059.68s]  It's so stupid.
[9063.63s -> 9064.67s]  Sus guy shits his pants.
[9069.78s -> 9104.99s]  I can't shoot these people.
[9104.99s -> 9105.23s]  Why?
[9111.15s -> 9113.63s]  Are you afraid of heights?
[9113.63s -> 9121.58s]  It's scripted.
[9121.58s -> 9122.06s]  Yes, it is.
[9126.13s -> 9127.25s]  Oh, bandit cave.
[9127.25s -> 9127.73s]  Let's go.
[9135.06s -> 9136.58s]  My son Joey's in there.
[9136.58s -> 9138.66s]  I don't know why I just thought this was Diablo 3.
[9139.86s -> 9142.58s]  I thought this guy was going to be following me around in the cave
[9142.58s -> 9145.38s]  and eventually show up in the camp with something.
[9145.38s -> 9146.34s]  Be like a merchant.
[9146.34s -> 9148.50s]  I don't know why I thought that's exactly what was going to happen.
[9148.50s -> 9148.74s]  All right.
[9148.74s -> 9149.14s]  What do you need?
[9149.14s -> 9149.62s]  What's going on?
[9150.34s -> 9152.18s]  I don't suppose you want to go in the cave.
[9153.57s -> 9155.01s]  Should we go in the cave?
[9155.01s -> 9155.57s]  Please.
[9155.57s -> 9155.81s]  Okay.
[9156.61s -> 9159.82s]  I hear cats meowing.
[9168.93s -> 9175.95s]  I know I played this game,
[9175.95s -> 9177.71s]  but for some reason I have zero memories of it.
[9178.51s -> 9181.12s]  Yeah, me too.
[9181.12s -> 9184.16s]  I think I went to the midnight release of this game.
[9190.27s -> 9192.14s]  I remember getting this super early.
[9193.66s -> 9200.72s]  Strength potion.
[9200.72s -> 9200.96s]  All right.
[9206.24s -> 9207.28s]  Super forgettable.
[9207.28s -> 9207.52s]  Oh.
[9211.12s -> 9214.91s]  I mean, yeah.
[9215.87s -> 9216.90s]  It was very...
[9216.90s -> 9217.94s]  Yeah, I don't remember any of this.
[9220.22s -> 9221.10s]  I remember the...
[9222.14s -> 9224.40s]  Oh, it's the sound of your own heartbeat.
[9224.40s -> 9224.80s]  That's it.
[9225.44s -> 9229.87s]  There's a sale going on or whatever.
[9229.87s -> 9236.27s]  I need some better items, though.
[9236.27s -> 9238.83s]  I can't just shock people all stream.
[9239.47s -> 9240.51s]  Oh, come here.
[9240.51s -> 9240.91s]  It's okay.
[9240.91s -> 9241.31s]  Come here.
[9242.03s -> 9244.18s]  What the fuck was that?
[9244.74s -> 9246.86s]  What the hell happened?
[9246.86s -> 9248.35s]  Oh, sorry.
[9248.35s -> 9250.11s]  I've never seen anything like this before.
[9250.11s -> 9251.07s]  Does this guy possessed?
[9251.71s -> 9257.33s]  This guy's going to die.
[9257.33s -> 9260.48s]  Oh, you're back.
[9260.48s -> 9266.72s]  Uh-oh.
[9267.18s -> 9274.13s]  All right.
[9274.13s -> 9274.69s]  Stay behind me.
[9284.53s -> 9290.88s]  Are they going to die?
[9291.68s -> 9295.30s]  Bum this guy.
[9295.30s -> 9295.94s]  I'm going holy shit.
[9295.94s -> 9297.78s]  This guy's really weak.
[9297.78s -> 9310.53s]  That was fucking awful.
[9332.74s -> 9333.06s]  I don't...
[9333.06s -> 9334.26s]  I'm the silent protagonist.
[9336.58s -> 9338.08s]  Get up here.
[9338.08s -> 9338.40s]  Let's go.
[9343.04s -> 9343.36s]  Come on.
[9343.36s -> 9344.16s]  I'm trying to save you.
[9348.06s -> 9351.41s]  Don't worry.
[9352.37s -> 9354.77s]  I put every single point in one move.
[9355.49s -> 9357.50s]  I barely know how to walk.
[9358.14s -> 9361.14s]  I don't know how to read.
[9361.94s -> 9363.70s]  I have no idea what a fucking pen does.
[9364.26s -> 9367.55s]  But let me tell you, when I was a little kid,
[9367.55s -> 9370.03s]  all the way through my early adulthood into my 30s,
[9370.03s -> 9372.91s]  I put every fucking birthday worth of points into lightning bolt.
[9372.91s -> 9373.71s]  We're going to be fine.
[9373.71s -> 9375.55s]  You're just going to have to guide me around.
[9375.55s -> 9377.68s]  Where's this dig spot?
[9379.81s -> 9381.90s]  But where is it?
[9381.90s -> 9382.54s]  What are you talking about?
[9383.18s -> 9393.14s]  And then I hit him in the chest.
[9393.14s -> 9395.54s]  I'm like, hey, hey, don't bring me near water, though.
[9395.54s -> 9396.82s]  Don't bring me near water, though.
[9397.94s -> 9401.98s]  I love myself a useless.
[9401.98s -> 9415.41s]  What's that one doing?
[9415.41s -> 9416.53s]  What's wrong with that guy?
[9417.41s -> 9419.09s]  Why is he shimming around his stomach?
[9431.97s -> 9432.85s]  One move, Andy.
[9432.85s -> 9433.33s]  That's right.
[9433.33s -> 9434.13s]  That's me.
[9434.13s -> 9444.18s]  This is how you gain magics points, though.
[9451.15s -> 9455.02s]  Dude, I mean, on all your birthday skill points,
[9455.02s -> 9458.46s]  you didn't put any into like even walking or running?
[9459.42s -> 9460.22s]  Nope.
[9460.22s -> 9466.51s]  Or thinking or like strength?
[9466.51s -> 9467.31s]  Nope, none.
[9467.39s -> 9474.18s]  I've actually I've had to be fed at a baby seat my entire life.
[9474.18s -> 9475.54s]  I don't even know what I don't even like.
[9475.54s -> 9477.06s]  I couldn't even tell you what food is.
[9477.06s -> 9478.58s]  I'm just saying somebody just gives it to me.
[9478.58s -> 9499.18s]  OK, I could power the entire city of Las Vegas if you let me.
[9499.18s -> 9501.07s]  Hey, let's go.
[9507.47s -> 9508.19s]  Shit dog.
[9508.19s -> 9509.63s]  What the fuck was that?
[9509.63s -> 9524.78s]  All right.
[9524.78s -> 9525.50s]  I'll handle this one.
[9526.94s -> 9530.34s]  What the hell is that?
[9530.90s -> 9532.83s]  What the hell was that?
[9534.53s -> 9535.01s]  Oh, shit.
[9535.01s -> 9535.73s]  Is he alive?
[9535.73s -> 9536.21s]  Where is he?
[9537.28s -> 9538.24s]  Oh, whoops.
[9538.24s -> 9547.42s]  My son into.
[9547.42s -> 9561.28s]  He dead.
[9562.00s -> 9563.04s]  You should get out of there.
[9563.84s -> 9565.28s]  Head for the surface quickly.
[9578.23s -> 9578.87s]  Oh, shit.
[9603.08s -> 9604.28s]  They got sick of my shit.
[9608.58s -> 9608.98s]  Shit.
[9608.98s -> 9609.30s]  OK.
[9610.02s -> 9611.22s]  They can't do that to me, right?
[9611.94s -> 9613.46s]  What am I doing?
[9614.48s -> 9615.04s]  Turn around.
[9617.67s -> 9618.87s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[9618.87s -> 9619.67s]  Turn around.
[9620.39s -> 9621.75s]  Turn around.
[9621.75s -> 9622.87s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[9622.87s -> 9623.83s]  Why am I stuck here?
[9624.71s -> 9627.33s]  Thank you.
[9627.97s -> 9643.27s]  All right, there we go.
[9643.27s -> 9650.69s]  Good.
[9650.69s -> 9651.57s]  Is he dead?
[9651.57s -> 9652.71s]  Nice.
[9652.71s -> 9652.95s]  All right.
[9652.95s -> 9653.59s]  I got a lot of points.
[9656.13s -> 9657.25s]  Force Lightning Andy.
[9657.89s -> 9659.33s]  I'm going to get new abilities.
[9659.33s -> 9659.81s]  Don't worry.
[9660.53s -> 9676.68s]  I need to get Vortex.
[9676.68s -> 9678.84s]  That's what I want.
[9678.84s -> 9695.52s]  Shock.
[9695.52s -> 9696.08s]  Shock.
[9696.08s -> 9696.88s]  Shock.
[9696.88s -> 9699.06s]  I do need to do melee, though.
[9699.06s -> 9701.38s]  I can't just not do melee.
[9701.38s -> 9703.41s]  How am I ever going to have health?
[9709.72s -> 9710.68s]  He's so bad.
[9711.24s -> 9711.96s]  Why am I bad?
[9721.80s -> 9722.52s]  Shut up.
[9722.52s -> 9728.64s]  Give these guys migraines so they fight each other.
[9728.64s -> 9739.75s]  Fight each other.
[9739.75s -> 9740.31s]  Do something.
[9740.95s -> 9744.10s]  All these level one spells are awful.
[9744.66s -> 9758.42s]  There's no mana.
[9758.42s -> 9759.46s]  No, there's no mana in the game.
[9759.46s -> 9760.34s]  That's right.
[9760.34s -> 9766.93s]  Look at this wooden ass sword, too.
[9767.65s -> 9772.21s]  Yeah, I'm going full Vortex.
[9773.17s -> 9775.25s]  I'm going to make Vortex my number one move.
[9775.97s -> 9788.18s]  Let's go.
[9788.18s -> 9792.31s]  There are no health bars other than your own.
[9792.31s -> 9793.03s]  That's true, too.
[9793.83s -> 9797.67s]  Watch out.
[9797.67s -> 9798.15s]  Don't die.
[9798.15s -> 9799.59s]  I can't die in Fable 2.
[9799.59s -> 9801.19s]  Not in the first two levels.
[9801.19s -> 9802.15s]  That would be embarrassing.
[9802.95s -> 9805.70s]  I'm stuck again.
[9806.34s -> 9807.86s]  Why am I stuck doing this again?
[9810.12s -> 9819.83s]  Fuck.
[9820.71s -> 9825.17s]  This is fun.
[9825.17s -> 9826.13s]  This is a fun game.
[9826.77s -> 9839.92s]  Let's go.
[9839.92s -> 9841.68s]  I'm not as experienced as whatever.
[9841.68s -> 9842.88s]  What the fuck is this?
[9842.88s -> 9844.16s]  This is Fable 2, man.
[9847.62s -> 9848.34s]  Fable 2.
[9848.90s -> 9849.22s]  Wait.
[9849.22s -> 9850.18s]  Give me that.
[9850.18s -> 9856.93s]  Did I miss?
[9859.64s -> 9860.28s]  I admitted something.
[9860.28s -> 9860.84s]  What did I admit?
[9861.40s -> 9871.17s]  Buy Vortex.
[9871.17s -> 9872.13s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9872.13s -> 9874.98s]  Let's do that.
[9874.98s -> 9875.22s]  Will.
[9876.48s -> 9877.44s]  Shock 2.
[9878.96s -> 9880.00s]  I could do Shock 2, though.
[9883.86s -> 9884.42s]  Vortex.
[9885.57s -> 9886.77s]  Yeah, I want Vortex.
[9888.50s -> 9889.54s]  Powerful Whirlwinds.
[9890.10s -> 9896.07s]  I can get level 2.
[9896.07s -> 9896.31s]  Done.
[9898.34s -> 9898.58s]  All right.
[9898.58s -> 9899.86s]  I have level 2 Vortex.
[9907.83s -> 9907.99s]  All right.
[9907.99s -> 9908.47s]  Let's do it.
[9911.30s -> 9912.82s]  You have several level one spells.
[9915.24s -> 9915.72s]  Oh, shit.
[9915.72s -> 9916.60s]  This is level one.
[9916.60s -> 9917.40s]  This is level two.
[9919.17s -> 9919.57s]  What does it do?
[9920.85s -> 9921.49s]  Oh, fuck.
[9926.39s -> 9927.43s]  Now it's level two.
[9927.99s -> 9930.64s]  Oh, my God.
[9930.64s -> 9930.88s]  All right.
[9930.88s -> 9932.08s]  This is going to be kind of insane.
[9940.63s -> 9942.87s]  I can't just cast Lightning Bolt exclusively.
[9942.87s -> 9943.75s]  No, apparently not.
[9944.31s -> 9951.00s]  Do Lightning and Vortex.
[9951.00s -> 9953.30s]  That sounds pretty good.
[9953.30s -> 9954.10s]  Grab them in the Vortex,
[9954.10s -> 9954.90s]  and when they're spinning around,
[9954.90s -> 9955.78s]  lightning the fuck out of them.
[9957.48s -> 9959.32s]  Yeah, I'll be Storm.
[9966.07s -> 9967.03s]  Storm Mage.
[9967.91s -> 9974.64s]  Do I have any food?
[9975.28s -> 9979.33s]  Throw potions.
[9980.93s -> 9981.57s]  Oh, here we go.
[9981.57s -> 9982.29s]  Yeah.
[9982.29s -> 9983.52s]  What's this?
[9984.16s -> 9988.53s]  100% natural state ingredients.
[9988.53s -> 9989.33s]  Combat drink?
[9997.72s -> 9997.88s]  What?
[10002.29s -> 10003.09s]  Oh, it's these guys.
[10003.09s -> 10003.81s]  It's the bridge guys.
[10003.81s -> 10004.05s]  All right.
[10004.05s -> 10004.85s]  Let's Vortex them.
[10025.19s -> 10027.35s]  I can just shoot them when they're doing that.
[10027.35s -> 10028.31s]  Oh, that's kind of cool.
[10039.62s -> 10040.34s]  It's a cool move,
[10040.34s -> 10045.35s]  but I will tell you that's really loud
[10045.35s -> 10046.31s]  and really annoying.
[10049.03s -> 10050.07s]  That's very loud,
[10050.07s -> 10052.23s]  and I have to do that every time I want to do a move.
[10052.87s -> 10059.52s]  Do Storm 2, then Lightning 1.
[10060.16s -> 10068.52s]  All right.
[10068.52s -> 10069.32s]  Where is it?
[10069.32s -> 10074.45s]  Good job, boy.
[10075.01s -> 10080.29s]  You look like Cosplay Jack Sparrow.
[10094.02s -> 10096.66s]  I look like any convention Jack Sparrow.
[10096.66s -> 10101.96s]  You know that guy that just dresses up as Jack Sparrow?
[10101.96s -> 10103.64s]  Doesn't really matter what the convention is.
[10103.64s -> 10110.55s]  Like, this could be like a lawyer convention.
[10111.11s -> 10114.44s]  A meeting of the attorneys-at-law,
[10114.44s -> 10116.76s]  and there would be a Jack Sparrow there.
[10116.76s -> 10126.52s]  The Association of Restaurant Managers Conference.
[10126.52s -> 10128.26s]  There'll be two Jack Sparrows there.
[10137.80s -> 10138.52s]  Eat more food.
[10138.52s -> 10138.76s]  I will.
[10138.76s -> 10140.20s]  I just had to do some quests.
[10140.20s -> 10147.08s]  You'll find it.
[10147.08s -> 10148.53s]  Come on.
[10148.53s -> 10149.01s]  You'll find it.
[10149.01s -> 10149.41s]  Where is it?
[10150.47s -> 10151.11s]  Where is it?
[10151.11s -> 10151.51s]  Come on.
[10151.51s -> 10151.83s]  Get it.
[10152.77s -> 10153.49s]  Pick up the scent.
[10153.49s -> 10154.05s]  You can do it.
[10154.05s -> 10154.85s]  There we go.
[10154.85s -> 10156.66s]  That's a good dog.
[10157.22s -> 10160.93s]  I saw Jack Sparrow at 4th of July once.
[10160.93s -> 10161.17s]  Right.
[10161.17s -> 10161.73s]  It doesn't matter.
[10161.73s -> 10163.57s]  Any large gathering.
[10163.57s -> 10170.47s]  Guys, if there's too many people in line at the ice cream store,
[10170.47s -> 10172.15s]  a Jack Sparrow will show up.
[10181.00s -> 10184.82s]  Okay.
[10184.82s -> 10187.33s]  So what do we got here?
[10187.33s -> 10191.57s]  Let's go.
[10192.13s -> 10197.92s]  This is Manure Manor.
[10198.48s -> 10199.44s]  I can buy this right now.
[10202.77s -> 10203.97s]  Owners killed.
[10204.61s -> 10210.28s]  Knock on this door.
[10210.28s -> 10212.60s]  If you want to commit vandalism, you could just...
[10212.60s -> 10215.30s]  Good evening.
[10215.30s -> 10217.40s]  Someone just tried to flirt with you.
[10219.48s -> 10220.44s]  Who's flirting with me?
[10221.16s -> 10225.70s]  Who's flirting with me?
[10239.12s -> 10240.24s]  Oh, you still want me to leave?
[10241.12s -> 10242.80s]  Oh, you want me to leave?
[10242.80s -> 10243.12s]  Leave?
[10243.12s -> 10243.68s]  Are you sure?
[10244.40s -> 10244.80s]  Did you see?
[10244.80s -> 10245.28s]  Oh, yeah.
[10245.28s -> 10246.88s]  Oh, you liked that a little bit though.
[10247.84s -> 10249.04s]  Are you sure you want me to leave?
[10249.68s -> 10250.48s]  Well, I can do this.
[10254.85s -> 10255.81s]  You love that though.
[10261.64s -> 10269.83s]  What?
[10269.83s -> 10271.19s]  You love me.
[10271.19s -> 10271.99s]  You love me.
[10272.63s -> 10273.38s]  All right.
[10273.38s -> 10274.50s]  Take what they have in the fridge.
[10274.50s -> 10275.30s]  Take everything.
[10275.30s -> 10288.00s]  Got more shit?
[10288.56s -> 10295.27s]  I'll be gone before they fucking even know I was here.
[10295.27s -> 10299.56s]  Holy shit.
[10299.56s -> 10300.20s]  What else they have?
[10300.20s -> 10300.92s]  Take it all.
[10300.92s -> 10303.60s]  There's no guards in this town.
[10303.60s -> 10304.40s]  There are no guards.
[10310.20s -> 10311.56s]  Rancid water.
[10311.56s -> 10313.65s]  Anything?
[10313.65s -> 10314.61s]  What else you got?
[10314.61s -> 10315.01s]  Sleep?
[10315.65s -> 10318.56s]  Wait, I'm sleeping in their bed?
[10318.56s -> 10322.55s]  No, I don't want to do that.
[10322.55s -> 10323.59s]  I want to get out of here.
[10323.59s -> 10328.61s]  All right.
[10328.61s -> 10329.17s]  Let's get the fuck out.
[10329.17s -> 10329.73s]  Go, go, go.
[10329.73s -> 10330.29s]  Out.
[10330.37s -> 10343.96s]  All right.
[10343.96s -> 10351.88s]  We got to like hide.
[10351.88s -> 10353.24s]  I'm like a squirrel.
[10353.24s -> 10355.03s]  I just stole a bunch of food in their house
[10355.03s -> 10356.15s]  and I ran around the corner and like
[10366.50s -> 10367.06s]  Hob water.
[10367.06s -> 10367.94s]  What does this do?
[10367.94s -> 10370.52s]  I don't know.
[10370.52s -> 10371.08s]  Drink it.
[10371.08s -> 10375.76s]  What are those bells?
[10376.88s -> 10379.27s]  Are those like rancid water?
[10379.27s -> 10383.30s]  Smells like eggs.
[10392.40s -> 10399.46s]  50 gold.
[10399.46s -> 10399.78s]  Fine.
[10399.78s -> 10400.18s]  Take it.
[10400.18s -> 10400.74s]  Get out.
[10400.74s -> 10402.85s]  That's nothing.
[10402.85s -> 10403.17s]  Take it.
[10413.36s -> 10415.76s]  What is this?
[10415.76s -> 10416.56s]  Woodcutter.
[10417.20s -> 10420.44s]  What happened to being a good boy?
[10421.16s -> 10426.47s]  I can be a bad person,
[10426.47s -> 10427.83s]  but a good boy.
[10427.83s -> 10429.83s]  No, I can be a good person,
[10429.83s -> 10430.55s]  but a bad boy.
[10430.55s -> 10431.03s]  There you go.
[10434.77s -> 10435.97s]  I'm a good person,
[10435.97s -> 10436.69s]  but I'm a bad boy.
[10439.57s -> 10444.56s]  You can also be a bad boy,
[10444.56s -> 10445.36s]  but a good person.
[10445.36s -> 10446.08s]  Good person, but...
[10446.08s -> 10446.40s]  No, no.
[10446.40s -> 10446.96s]  What is...
[10446.96s -> 10447.92s]  Say that in reverse.
[10447.92s -> 10448.64s]  A good person,
[10448.64s -> 10451.06s]  but a bad boy.
[10451.06s -> 10451.78s]  A good boy,
[10451.78s -> 10452.58s]  but a bad person.
[10452.58s -> 10453.14s]  That's not me.
[10453.14s -> 10454.50s]  I am a good...
[10454.50s -> 10455.14s]  What's going on?
[10455.14s -> 10455.86s]  Get away from me.
[10455.86s -> 10463.27s]  Slow down and say it.
[10463.27s -> 10464.71s]  Okay.
[10464.71s -> 10466.31s]  You can be a good boy,
[10466.31s -> 10467.51s]  but a bad person.
[10467.51s -> 10474.61s]  That's not me.
[10474.61s -> 10475.89s]  I am a bad boy,
[10475.89s -> 10477.09s]  but a good person.
[10477.09s -> 10479.43s]  Did I say the same thing twice?
[10490.37s -> 10491.65s]  Say it slower.
[10491.65s -> 10492.69s]  No, you get it.
[10492.69s -> 10493.49s]  You know what I mean.
[10493.49s -> 10496.13s]  Did I just get wood chips
[10496.13s -> 10496.85s]  in that girl's eyes?
[10501.64s -> 10502.52s]  I work for your dad.
[10502.52s -> 10505.33s]  Get out of here.
[10505.33s -> 10505.81s]  What?
[10505.81s -> 10522.15s]  How am I going to get...
[10522.15s -> 10523.03s]  I don't want to do another
[10523.03s -> 10524.47s]  get promoted job.
[10524.47s -> 10530.10s]  How are you a good person?
[10531.38s -> 10533.22s]  I unlock that cage
[10533.22s -> 10533.86s]  and let the person out.
[10533.86s -> 10535.24s]  Let the people out.
[10535.24s -> 10536.52s]  All the time the bandits have been like,
[10536.52s -> 10537.56s]  I'll give you free gold
[10537.56s -> 10538.76s]  if you just give me the warrants.
[10538.76s -> 10539.32s]  Nope.
[10552.05s -> 10552.93s]  I'm only getting eight gold
[10552.93s -> 10553.81s]  for this shit.
[10553.81s -> 10559.67s]  This is a horrible amount of gold.
[10559.67s -> 10561.88s]  How have I been a bad boy?
[10563.38s -> 10564.34s]  I stole a bunch of stuff.
[10565.14s -> 10566.58s]  I made a fart noise
[10566.58s -> 10567.30s]  in front of somebody
[10567.30s -> 10569.62s]  in front of the person's...
[10569.62s -> 10570.26s]  I went in their house.
[10570.26s -> 10571.62s]  I farted and danced in their house.
[10579.65s -> 10581.25s]  Multiplier has stopped at three.
[10581.25s -> 10582.37s]  Oh, I've been promoted.
[10582.37s -> 10583.17s]  Shit.
[10583.17s -> 10592.63s]  That's bad person behavior.
[10592.63s -> 10593.19s]  No, it's not.
[10594.52s -> 10595.56s]  Bad person...
[10595.56s -> 10596.92s]  Bad person behavior
[10596.92s -> 10599.00s]  is if I did not let them out
[10599.00s -> 10601.96s]  and I made a deal with the bandit.
[10601.96s -> 10607.97s]  You can be a good person,
[10607.97s -> 10608.93s]  but a bad boy.
[10616.56s -> 10617.60s]  You can be a bad person
[10617.60s -> 10618.24s]  and a good boy.
[10618.80s -> 10635.96s]  You drove a family out of their home
[10635.96s -> 10636.92s]  and you stole their food.
[10637.64s -> 10638.28s]  No.
[10638.28s -> 10641.16s]  I danced so widely,
[10641.16s -> 10641.88s]  entertainingly.
[10642.84s -> 10643.32s]  By the way,
[10643.32s -> 10646.93s]  all three of them loved it
[10646.93s -> 10648.13s]  that they ran away
[10648.13s -> 10650.24s]  because they couldn't believe
[10650.24s -> 10651.28s]  how fun it was.
[10651.28s -> 10652.56s]  And they needed to go find
[10652.56s -> 10653.60s]  all the people in the town
[10653.60s -> 10654.96s]  to come watch me.
[10654.96s -> 10659.14s]  And I just helped myself
[10659.14s -> 10660.34s]  to the stuff that was in their fridge.
[10660.98s -> 10672.13s]  Somebody said,
[10672.13s -> 10673.17s]  go watch Megamind.
[10673.17s -> 10673.81s]  You'll love it.
[10674.69s -> 10676.61s]  Why would I like Megamind?
[10676.61s -> 10687.17s]  Why would I watch...
[10688.15s -> 10690.07s]  I don't want to watch Megamind.
[10690.63s -> 10696.74s]  You know, I wrote Megamind off
[10698.32s -> 10699.52s]  because I just figured
[10699.52s -> 10700.72s]  it was Will Ferrell movie
[10700.72s -> 10702.64s]  number like 55 or whatever.
[10702.64s -> 10715.94s]  Megamind's a villain like you.
[10717.89s -> 10719.67s]  Why am I a villain?
[10719.67s -> 10720.40s]  What did I do?
[10721.20s -> 10724.74s]  Well, the only reason why
[10724.74s -> 10725.62s]  you guys are saying Megamind
[10725.62s -> 10726.26s]  was a good movie
[10726.26s -> 10726.90s]  is because that's where
[10726.90s -> 10727.86s]  penis music is from.
[10741.72s -> 10743.09s]  That's false.
[10743.09s -> 10743.49s]  That's not.
[10745.49s -> 10755.81s]  Yeah, I probably would like Megamind.
[10755.81s -> 10756.13s]  You're right.
[10759.72s -> 10762.00s]  Maybe I'll watch it tonight.
[10762.00s -> 10767.14s]  I'll watch it.
[10767.62s -> 10768.26s]  I'll watch it later.
[10768.90s -> 10773.46s]  I will give you guys
[10773.46s -> 10775.78s]  my assessment of Megamind tomorrow.
[10775.78s -> 10776.88s]  Just kidding.
[10776.88s -> 10777.76s]  I'm not watching that tonight.
[10785.40s -> 10786.28s]  I don't need any more money.
[10786.28s -> 10786.52s]  I'm good.
[10787.32s -> 10788.44s]  I am going to buy this house, though.
[10788.44s -> 10789.08s]  I'm buying the farm.
[10789.72s -> 10793.14s]  This thing's...
[10793.14s -> 10794.58s]  It's only 2,800...
[10794.58s -> 10795.54s]  4,600 bucks.
[10796.10s -> 10798.15s]  Did I buy it and move in?
[10798.71s -> 10800.37s]  I want it.
[10800.37s -> 10801.17s]  It's mine.
[10801.17s -> 10803.86s]  This is my house.
[10819.22s -> 10820.34s]  Animal magnetism?
[10821.06s -> 10831.19s]  All right, cool.
[10831.19s -> 10831.99s]  So now I have a house.
[10832.71s -> 10833.59s]  My house is the farm.
[10834.23s -> 10836.77s]  I could rent it out, though, couldn't I?
[10840.18s -> 10840.58s]  Rent out.
[10840.58s -> 10841.30s]  How much could I rent?
[10841.86s -> 10846.60s]  This is not a bad idea.
[10853.28s -> 10854.88s]  I'll get $50 every five minutes.
[10855.44s -> 10863.70s]  I'll take it.
[10863.70s -> 10863.94s]  All right.
[10863.94s -> 10869.44s]  Where am I going?
[10869.44s -> 10873.17s]  You can improve it with decorations
[10873.17s -> 10873.97s]  to increase the price.
[10874.77s -> 10877.01s]  I slept in it for one day.
[10877.01s -> 10877.97s]  Yeah, well, I don't...
[10877.97s -> 10878.77s]  I need to like make...
[10878.77s -> 10880.53s]  I need to have like a family first.
[10880.53s -> 10888.60s]  How much is this place?
[10888.60s -> 10888.92s]  Please.
[10889.56s -> 10895.30s]  6,400.
[10895.30s -> 10905.40s]  Anybody here?
[10905.40s -> 10910.93s]  Open the door, then.
[10910.93s -> 10913.76s]  Open the door.
[10913.76s -> 10915.22s]  I have something very important.
[10915.22s -> 10916.66s]  I'm the goddamn quest guy.
[10916.66s -> 10918.02s]  I'm saving this town.
[10918.02s -> 10919.22s]  I need to ask you stuff.
[10919.22s -> 10928.34s]  My head.
[10941.14s -> 10952.16s]  Oh, shit.
[10952.16s -> 10952.96s]  They opened the door.
[10957.32s -> 10957.72s]  Hello.
[10964.29s -> 10964.93s]  Thank you.
[10964.93s -> 10966.61s]  I have a master woodcutter.
[10966.61s -> 10967.01s]  You're right.
[10969.83s -> 10970.39s]  You think so?
[10993.52s -> 10995.52s]  Why would you run to their bathroom?
[10995.52s -> 10997.52s]  Why would you run to their bathroom?
[10998.08s -> 10998.72s]  They pay me?
[11001.04s -> 11006.77s]  Quality item.
[11006.77s -> 11008.21s]  Why would I run out of their house?
[11009.01s -> 11010.13s]  Run to the bathroom?
[11014.08s -> 11014.72s]  Oh, man.
[11015.44s -> 11015.76s]  All right.
[11015.76s -> 11016.48s]  What am I...
[11016.48s -> 11017.52s]  Where's the breadcrumbs going?
[11021.54s -> 11022.74s]  Oh, I need more breadcrumbs.
[11022.74s -> 11025.12s]  You're an adventurer, right?
[11025.12s -> 11025.68s]  What's going on?
[11028.48s -> 11029.60s]  Why are the breadcrumbs not...
[11032.20s -> 11033.24s]  I need breadcrumbs.
[11033.24s -> 11034.68s]  I can't function without them.
[11035.24s -> 11040.15s]  What do I have to do to this guy?
[11040.15s -> 11042.18s]  Whoa, put it back.
[11042.18s -> 11042.66s]  Put it back.
[11042.66s -> 11043.06s]  Put it back.
[11043.06s -> 11043.54s]  How do I put it down?
[11043.54s -> 11044.18s]  Put it down.
[11044.18s -> 11045.38s]  Put it down.
[11045.38s -> 11045.94s]  Put the gun down.
[11045.94s -> 11046.26s]  Put it down.
[11046.26s -> 11047.06s]  Put it down.
[11047.06s -> 11047.38s]  Put it down.
[11047.38s -> 11048.34s]  How do I put things down?
[11048.90s -> 11049.54s]  Quick, quick.
[11049.54s -> 11050.82s]  Make somebody laugh.
[11050.82s -> 11059.51s]  Nobody liked that.
[11059.51s -> 11059.67s]  All right.
[11059.67s -> 11060.87s]  I have to get out of this town.
[11060.87s -> 11065.04s]  Put that cookie down now.
[11065.76s -> 11069.30s]  Oh, look.
[11069.30s -> 11070.34s]  This person likes me.
[11070.34s -> 11071.22s]  You want to have tea?
[11071.86s -> 11074.68s]  You all right?
[11074.68s -> 11086.90s]  Okay.
[11086.90s -> 11087.70s]  Do I have any presents?
[11087.70s -> 11088.74s]  I do have a present, don't I?
[11091.88s -> 11092.44s]  Oh, thank you.
[11097.33s -> 11097.73s]  Thank you.
[11102.77s -> 11103.70s]  All right.
[11103.70s -> 11104.34s]  So now how do I...
[11105.54s -> 11109.43s]  I need info.
[11110.15s -> 11111.32s]  Social.
[11114.39s -> 11114.87s]  Follow me.
[11122.24s -> 11122.72s]  Come with me.
[11126.74s -> 11128.02s]  Wait, what did you say?
[11129.00s -> 11129.72s]  What did you say?
[11129.72s -> 11130.44s]  Who said that?
[11130.44s -> 11131.08s]  Did you say that?
[11131.88s -> 11133.19s]  What did you say?
[11136.96s -> 11137.28s]  Yes.
[11137.28s -> 11147.62s]  A game master?
[11155.59s -> 11155.99s]  I can't.
[11156.87s -> 11159.14s]  Play Spinner Box a tutorial.
[11159.78s -> 11162.21s]  A spinner box is a decorative box
[11162.21s -> 11165.01s]  containing several devices called flit switches.
[11165.57s -> 11167.49s]  A flit switch is a magical spinner
[11167.49s -> 11169.41s]  that will randomly cycle through a variety of symbols.
[11169.41s -> 11171.57s]  To play this, just place your bet and spin.
[11171.57s -> 11175.27s]  What do I need to do?
[11175.27s -> 11179.73s]  Okay.
[11179.73s -> 11181.65s]  This is cow and corset.
[11182.13s -> 11184.45s]  A three-switch spinner box.
[11184.45s -> 11186.53s]  Raise your bet to six gold and spin.
[11186.53s -> 11187.25s]  Okay, spin it.
[11190.55s -> 11191.91s]  I want to bet more than six.
[11192.63s -> 11198.39s]  As you can see, not every spin is a winner.
[11198.95s -> 11203.46s]  Four more adjacent symbols of the same type.
[11203.46s -> 11211.17s]  Here we go.
[11211.17s -> 11215.00s]  Look at that.
[11215.00s -> 11215.80s]  Bigger chains.
[11215.80s -> 11216.12s]  Okay.
[11216.84s -> 11221.22s]  Oh, nice.
[11221.22s -> 11221.78s]  All right, let's go.
[11224.39s -> 11226.47s]  Why can I not do a more than 10 bet?
[11226.47s -> 11231.32s]  It's just fantasy slots.
[11231.32s -> 11231.82s]  Yeah.
[11232.60s -> 11233.24s]  Look at that.
[11233.24s -> 11234.36s]  Look at how much money I just made.
[11236.24s -> 11237.28s]  600 gold?
[11238.00s -> 11239.28s]  If I had bet 20 bucks,
[11239.28s -> 11251.09s]  that would have been like five grand.
[11251.09s -> 11253.17s]  Imagine needing a tutorial for a slot machine.
[11253.81s -> 11261.44s]  Okay.
[11261.44s -> 11269.24s]  Free spins.
[11269.24s -> 11270.20s]  This is just a slot machine.
[11270.20s -> 11271.40s]  Why do I even need a tutorial?
[11272.20s -> 11276.71s]  Cool.
[11276.71s -> 11277.03s]  All right.
[11277.03s -> 11277.59s]  Yeah, I get it.
[11278.98s -> 11280.96s]  All right.
[11280.96s -> 11281.52s]  You pay out.
[11281.52s -> 11281.84s]  It's cool.
[11282.72s -> 11283.92s]  Are we ready?
[11283.92s -> 11284.32s]  Let's go.
[11291.68s -> 11291.92s]  All right.
[11291.92s -> 11292.80s]  Adjust bet.
[11292.80s -> 11295.70s]  It's a max bet.
[11296.34s -> 11296.58s]  10?
[11301.46s -> 11302.90s]  I can only put 10 bucks in here?
[11303.70s -> 11322.34s]  Here we go.
[11322.34s -> 11323.14s]  There we go.
[11323.14s -> 11329.08s]  All right.
[11329.08s -> 11329.80s]  Let me make...
[11329.80s -> 11336.28s]  Let me get a bonus and I'll leave.
[11336.28s -> 11337.24s]  Pack it up, boys.
[11337.24s -> 11337.72s]  No.
[11337.72s -> 11338.28s]  Pack...
[11338.28s -> 11339.00s]  Stay here.
[11339.00s -> 11357.00s]  To make the amount of spins larger.
[11357.00s -> 11357.88s]  What is with these spins?
[11364.69s -> 11366.05s]  How am I not winning any money?
[11366.05s -> 11374.52s]  What the fuck is that?
[11374.52s -> 11380.15s]  What the fuck?
[11380.15s -> 11381.11s]  Build a bank up.
[11381.11s -> 11393.81s]  All right.
[11393.81s -> 11396.05s]  That's a super bonus cow spin.
[11396.05s -> 11398.32s]  That's 500.
[11398.32s -> 11400.66s]  I'm good.
[11400.66s -> 11401.22s]  I'm still here.
[11401.22s -> 11401.86s]  Let's go.
[11401.86s -> 11407.64s]  One more of those and I'll leave.
[11407.64s -> 11426.07s]  House, house, house.
[11426.07s -> 11427.27s]  Oh, come on.
[11427.27s -> 11429.52s]  Timed?
[11429.52s -> 11430.56s]  It better not be.
[11430.56s -> 11444.60s]  As far as slot machines go,
[11444.60s -> 11445.72s]  this is really dull.
[11445.72s -> 11447.24s]  It kind of is, isn't it?
[11447.24s -> 11452.15s]  Here we go.
[11452.15s -> 11452.95s]  Guys, I made 100 bucks.
[11468.16s -> 11470.00s]  Oh, he's hyper speed spinning.
[11470.00s -> 11471.52s]  Somebody get him off the machine.
[11471.52s -> 11472.40s]  Get him off the machine.
[11472.40s -> 11473.52s]  He's hyper spinning.
[11473.52s -> 11474.93s]  Get him off.
[11474.93s -> 11475.41s]  Get him off.
[11475.41s -> 11475.97s]  All right.
[11476.05s -> 11477.01s]  Cash out, cash out, cash out.
[11477.01s -> 11477.57s]  Grab him.
[11477.57s -> 11478.53s]  Grab him.
[11478.53s -> 11479.01s]  Grab him.
[11479.01s -> 11479.49s]  Just grab him.
[11480.13s -> 11481.17s]  No, what happened?
[11481.89s -> 11484.74s]  All right.
[11484.74s -> 11485.06s]  We're good.
[11485.06s -> 11488.00s]  I'm losing your money.
[11488.00s -> 11490.16s]  Hey, debt.
[11490.16s -> 11491.76s]  What the fuck is this?
[11491.76s -> 11494.21s]  What do you mean?
[11494.21s -> 11495.49s]  How much debt do I have?
[11495.49s -> 11496.13s]  What is that?
[11499.68s -> 11500.40s]  What?
[11500.40s -> 11512.07s]  Why do I have debt?
[11512.07s -> 11531.20s]  I'm going to take this to zero
[11531.20s -> 11532.00s]  and I'm going to leave.
[11532.00s -> 11549.70s]  Come on.
[11549.70s -> 11555.22s]  Do it.
[11555.22s -> 11555.94s]  Yeah, I want to see.
[11556.90s -> 11558.34s]  I want to examine the machine.
[11558.34s -> 11560.82s]  I want the gaming board to look at this
[11560.82s -> 11562.10s]  and see if it's actually real.
[11562.10s -> 11564.08s]  This is bullshit.
[11564.08s -> 11576.50s]  That's the last one.
[11576.50s -> 11577.88s]  All right.
[11577.88s -> 11578.44s]  This is bullshit.
[11578.44s -> 11579.08s]  This thing sucks.
[11582.18s -> 11582.82s]  What?
[11584.74s -> 11586.02s]  Points to next level?
[11587.17s -> 11590.02s]  Why do I level up my gambling?
[11590.96s -> 11592.32s]  Is this like when you get the cards
[11592.32s -> 11593.52s]  at the casinos
[11593.52s -> 11594.48s]  where you build points
[11594.48s -> 11596.24s]  and eventually after like two years
[11596.24s -> 11596.80s]  of gambling,
[11596.80s -> 11598.08s]  they give you one free night
[11598.08s -> 11599.52s]  at a room at the hotel?
[11606.90s -> 11609.22s]  Imagine being a level five gambler.
[11609.22s -> 11610.18s]  I kind of want to do that.
[11611.24s -> 11613.08s]  I kind of want to be level five gambler.
[11614.21s -> 11615.33s]  I need to get to the next level.
[11615.33s -> 11615.89s]  I have to.
[11623.56s -> 11623.96s]  All right.
[11623.96s -> 11624.44s]  There was a...
[11624.44s -> 11625.64s]  We're supposed to be going on like a date.
[11627.00s -> 11627.48s]  Come with me.
[11628.04s -> 11630.45s]  Come on in here.
[11634.92s -> 11636.20s]  And gold to hear the bard.
[11651.94s -> 11652.18s]  What?
[11654.98s -> 11656.82s]  Ever leave me again?
[11657.62s -> 11658.58s]  Holy shit.
[11664.13s -> 11665.28s]  Oh, let's dance.
[11695.19s -> 11696.71s]  Beg.
[11700.71s -> 11702.07s]  That was really nice.
[11702.07s -> 11702.47s]  Thank you.
[11703.75s -> 11705.84s]  That was wonderful.
[11706.64s -> 11709.59s]  Why are we all stuffed here?
[11711.51s -> 11711.75s]  Okay.
[11711.75s -> 11712.95s]  I want to know what you like.
[11723.38s -> 11723.54s]  Okay.
[11723.54s -> 11724.02s]  How do I get...
[11724.02s -> 11724.98s]  I want to know her needs.
[11726.02s -> 11726.26s]  All right.
[11726.26s -> 11726.66s]  Come with me.
[11730.63s -> 11732.45s]  Oh, there we go.
[11732.45s -> 11732.77s]  Gwyneth...
[11732.77s -> 11733.57s]  Wait, the farmer?
[11734.29s -> 11750.79s]  Wait, can we sleep somewhere?
[11750.79s -> 11751.59s]  Oh, barman.
[11751.59s -> 11752.23s]  All right.
[11752.23s -> 11753.78s]  This is a pretty good date.
[11756.98s -> 11757.22s]  Yeah.
[11757.22s -> 11758.26s]  Let's have to take a few of these.
[11763.09s -> 11763.73s]  Get some beer.
[11767.19s -> 11767.51s]  Rum.
[11769.78s -> 11770.85s]  Okay.
[11770.85s -> 11771.57s]  Here you go.
[11771.57s -> 11772.05s]  Do you want a drink?
[11772.85s -> 11773.41s]  Here.
[11773.41s -> 11775.80s]  I got you a drink.
[11775.80s -> 11780.13s]  Where's a gift?
[11781.89s -> 11782.85s]  A gift.
[11782.85s -> 11784.79s]  How about a...
[11786.76s -> 11787.72s]  Um...
[11787.72s -> 11793.46s]  Would you like a glass of rum?
[11793.46s -> 11798.05s]  All right.
[11802.50s -> 11805.04s]  Wait, this is the person that was already drunk?
[11805.04s -> 11805.68s]  Oh.
[11805.68s -> 11809.57s]  Well, I thought it was a different person.
[11809.57s -> 11809.89s]  All right.
[11809.89s -> 11811.17s]  Well, I'm going to drink something.
[11811.17s -> 11818.72s]  Oh, shit.
[11818.72s -> 11819.92s]  I almost just did the whirlwind.
[11820.96s -> 11822.98s]  I don't want to get drunk because I don't want to be like,
[11822.98s -> 11825.14s]  oh, you want to see a real cool trick?
[11825.70s -> 11826.98s]  Watch this shit.
[11826.98s -> 11828.82s]  And then cause a tornado inside of this place.
[11836.32s -> 11838.24s]  Level five gambling addict.
[11839.04s -> 11846.28s]  No, it's fun.
[11846.84s -> 11850.28s]  That's not going to actually destroy everything, will it?
[11855.06s -> 11856.93s]  More info.
[11856.93s -> 11857.57s]  Okay.
[11857.57s -> 11859.68s]  She likes to be seduced.
[11863.24s -> 11865.08s]  She currently thinks I'm kind of attractive.
[11865.08s -> 11866.44s]  She thinks I'm funny.
[11866.44s -> 11882.32s]  What do I do?
[11882.32s -> 11883.12s]  How do I stop this?
[11883.12s -> 11883.68s]  How do I stop?
[11883.68s -> 11884.96s]  How do I stop from doing this to them?
[11885.68s -> 11886.48s]  What's cancel?
[11886.48s -> 11887.12s]  What's cancel?
[11887.12s -> 11888.00s]  How do I cancel?
[11888.00s -> 11889.44s]  How do I cancel?
[11889.44s -> 11891.04s]  How do I cancel a spell?
[11891.04s -> 11892.08s]  How do you cancel a spell?
[11892.64s -> 11894.08s]  Does anybody know how to cancel a spell?
[11896.36s -> 11898.52s]  I'm going to throw it into the bathroom.
[11899.78s -> 11900.66s]  I can't cancel it?
[11906.05s -> 11907.17s]  Oh shit, his bar.
[11912.07s -> 11912.71s]  What is this?
[11913.51s -> 11914.55s]  What's wrong with me?
[11925.46s -> 11926.58s]  They liked it.
[11927.14s -> 11928.02s]  They liked it?
[11930.63s -> 11931.27s]  Holy shit.
[11931.27s -> 11932.47s]  Why do they think this is cool?
[11935.68s -> 11936.80s]  You thought it was stupid?
[11944.61s -> 11945.97s]  You sure you want to tell the guy?
[11956.58s -> 11957.78s]  I would kill you right now.
[11958.58s -> 11960.50s]  If it wasn't for the guy that just pet the dog behind me.
[11961.14s -> 11963.54s]  So he just saved you.
[11963.54s -> 11965.41s]  He just saved you.
[11965.41s -> 11968.42s]  I was about to just drop the vortex right here, but he pet the dog.
[11970.85s -> 11971.73s]  Lucky fucking day.
[11976.88s -> 11978.16s]  All right, I want to let's go.
[11985.73s -> 11987.17s]  Ladies kind of freaking me out.

[12025.60s -> 12026.48s]  You're engaged.
[12034.37s -> 12035.25s]  Wait, who the fuck is this?
[12037.73s -> 12038.61s]  We only had a house.

[12054.31s -> 12056.87s]  I'll take you back to my esteemed sedate.
[12057.43s -> 12059.11s]  Manure manor.
[12066.28s -> 12071.49s]  Which lives for only a few decades before producing a single golden acorn.
[12072.13s -> 12076.53s]  The monks of the temple of light replant this acorn and as the tree is reborn.
[12076.53s -> 12078.53s]  So are all the lands and farms around.
[12079.41s -> 12081.33s]  The Abbot is quite nervous about this year.
[12083.81s -> 12085.89s]  Get away from wait, wait, wait, should you not be here?
[12086.77s -> 12088.53s]  I feel like I'm afraid like doing moves.

[12092.08s -> 12094.93s]  She didn't care.
[12100.29s -> 12101.49s]  This is weird.
[12101.49s -> 12103.25s]  All right, where's the house?
[12103.97s -> 12104.69s]  Where's our house?
[12107.20s -> 12108.32s]  Wrong way.
[12108.32s -> 12118.85s]  Where's the map?
[12118.85s -> 12119.73s]  Where's my house?
[12123.88s -> 12124.92s]  In the middle of the street.
[12127.36s -> 12128.32s]  I don't, what street?
[12134.52s -> 12138.37s]  Like going towards it?
[12138.37s -> 12139.09s]  It's over here, right?
[12139.65s -> 12144.40s]  Is that it right there?
[12145.04s -> 12147.84s]  Where's this breadcrumb?
[12147.84s -> 12149.84s]  This breadcrumb trail is not loading properly.
[12150.96s -> 12162.77s]  Oh, here we go.
[12162.77s -> 12163.25s]  It's up here.

[12173.89s -> 12176.71s]  This way.
[12177.35s -> 12182.16s]  Come on in.
[12182.72s -> 12184.07s]  It's our home.
[12184.71s -> 12187.75s]  Get in here.
[12188.48s -> 12189.68s]  All right, we did it.
[12190.93s -> 12191.57s]  We are here.
[12192.29s -> 12205.25s]  Okay, so now we're engaged and now we're going to...
[12211.36s -> 12211.92s]  What are we doing?
[12211.92s -> 12212.64s]  What do we do now?
[12223.11s -> 12223.35s]  Okay.
[12229.94s -> 12230.90s]  How do we make, how do we...
[12232.02s -> 12232.50s]  We're going to have...
[12233.38s -> 12234.90s]  Are we going to have like a child?
[12237.46s -> 12241.48s]  All right, so we're going to go to the sign outside the house.
[12242.20s -> 12247.86s]  Evict tenant.
[12248.93s -> 12250.77s]  Oh, set as marital home.
[12260.44s -> 12269.56s]  I met this person the last night.
[12276.64s -> 12279.89s]  I destroyed a bar and then we got married.
[12280.45s -> 12287.00s]  You've received a dowry of cash and a renowned boost.
[12287.64s -> 12289.64s]  You get better bonuses from your house.
[12289.64s -> 12290.84s]  You might also receive gifts.
[12291.80s -> 12294.04s]  Use the house sign to set your household budget.
[12294.84s -> 12297.44s]  Maybe a household budget.
[12301.56s -> 12302.68s]  Household budget?
[12304.20s -> 12304.92s]  Uh, zero.
[12307.43s -> 12308.55s]  Daily deduction?
[12310.21s -> 12310.53s]  What?
[12321.43s -> 12323.43s]  What are you talking about?
[12323.43s -> 12325.76s]  This villager has a reward to give away.
[12325.76s -> 12327.44s]  Use the appropriate expression or give them gifts
[12327.44s -> 12329.28s]  to move the slider towards the gift icon.
[12338.07s -> 12338.71s]  What did you get me?
[12339.43s -> 12342.90s]  Oh, it's a will potion.
[12344.42s -> 12344.82s]  Thank you.
[12347.86s -> 12349.06s]  I got you this gift.
[12349.06s -> 12349.70s]  Another one?
[12355.48s -> 12356.84s]  She's still drunk?
[12356.84s -> 12357.88s]  No, she's not.
[12362.53s -> 12363.73s]  Swap, what can we swap?
[12365.32s -> 12366.12s]  Oh, okay, whatever.
[12369.62s -> 12371.30s]  She's not still drunk.
[12375.75s -> 12376.79s]  All right, we're good.
[12376.79s -> 12379.56s]  Missed you.
[12379.56s -> 12380.44s]  Hello, darlings.
[12385.78s -> 12388.69s]  All right, all right.
[12389.41s -> 12391.72s]  You're the best.
[12391.72s -> 12393.40s]  Here, you want some...
[12393.40s -> 12394.12s]  You want a snack?
[12396.10s -> 12396.58s]  A boat?
[12396.58s -> 12401.16s]  Hey, uh, for some boots.
[12401.64s -> 12409.38s]  She's still following me around.
[12409.94s -> 12412.13s]  Who's this?
[12412.85s -> 12414.47s]  What do you want?
[12414.47s -> 12421.44s]  Are you clapping and saying nice to my wife?
[12426.05s -> 12427.65s]  What the fuck is happening right now?
[12427.65s -> 12428.45s]  Are you kidding me?
[12434.88s -> 12435.52s]  What?
[12435.52s -> 12441.11s]  She's drunk.
[12461.11s -> 12463.04s]  She was congratulating your marriage.
[12463.84s -> 12465.43s]  I know.
[12465.43s -> 12467.43s]  All right, time to celebrate with some pies.
[12467.91s -> 12470.80s]  Let us see what we can do.
[12470.80s -> 12472.72s]  Oh, nasty nuts.
[12472.72s -> 12473.52s]  Rotten apples.
[12475.08s -> 12476.52s]  Rancid apple pie.
[12476.52s -> 12477.72s]  Dude, whatever, I'll eat it.
[12480.10s -> 12481.30s]  Wait, man flesh?
[12492.08s -> 12493.20s]  Oh, I'm not eating one of these.
[12493.76s -> 12504.04s]  No, that means evil.
[12504.76s -> 12506.28s]  That makes you evil if you eat that.
[12506.28s -> 12512.66s]  I think we're ready for our love to get physical.
[12512.66s -> 12513.46s]  Really?
[12513.46s -> 12513.96s]  Yep.
[12516.17s -> 12518.33s]  You finally got rid of that headache, dear.
[12519.69s -> 12521.26s]  Let's go.
[12528.14s -> 12528.64s]  Let's go.
[12529.02s -> 12537.11s]  That guy's not going to come in here, right?
[12546.74s -> 12548.26s]  I just ate like three pies.
[12553.10s -> 12556.38s]  I imagine I have like blueberry stain all over my mouth.
[12563.90s -> 12564.30s]  What?
[12564.30s -> 12565.18s]  Already?
[12565.18s -> 12566.11s]  Ow.
[12568.92s -> 12570.04s]  I'm speed running this.
[12582.87s -> 12593.59s]  Okay, so now we have a kid.
[12596.15s -> 12597.43s]  I got speed boost.
[12600.49s -> 12602.78s]  Wait, is that because...
[12604.28s -> 12604.84s]  Never mind.
[12607.06s -> 12609.30s]  Congratulations on starting a family.
[12610.25s -> 12612.89s]  Entertain your newborn by facing the cot,
[12612.89s -> 12614.81s]  getting their attention with left trigger,
[12616.07s -> 12617.51s]  and performing expressions.
[12617.51s -> 12619.11s]  A happy family gives you better bonuses.
[12619.67s -> 12622.55s]  Find out more about your offspring and name them if you like
[12622.55s -> 12625.27s]  by holding the left trigger pressing Y to see the personality screen.
[12627.22s -> 12627.78s]  Oh, a present.
[12632.42s -> 12632.98s]  What'd you get me?
[12637.78s -> 12638.18s]  What?
[12638.18s -> 12639.06s]  You got me a quest?
[12643.38s -> 12644.10s]  Oh, thank you.
[12646.44s -> 12647.24s]  Well, give it to me.
[12647.24s -> 12647.64s]  I want it.
[12648.36s -> 12650.76s]  Ooh, will potion.
[12650.76s -> 12651.08s]  Thank you.
[12651.72s -> 12652.36s]  Where's the baby?
[12654.14s -> 12654.86s]  Hello, baby.
[12655.50s -> 12660.66s]  This is Gwyneth the farmer.
[12660.66s -> 12664.17s]  Wait, is this a baby?
[12665.13s -> 12665.69s]  Wait, what?
[12667.03s -> 12667.59s]  No, it's not.
[12667.59s -> 12668.23s]  This is the baby.
[12668.79s -> 12670.25s]  How do I talk to the baby?
[12673.61s -> 12675.13s]  Likes beef jerky.
[12678.60s -> 12680.12s]  I kind of like Kiernan.
[12681.83s -> 12683.11s]  Likes beef jerky.
[12683.11s -> 12687.37s]  I don't think it's supposed to feed beef jerky to a baby
[12687.37s -> 12689.08s]  and loves toy boat.
[12689.08s -> 12690.28s]  All right, victory arm pump.
[12690.28s -> 12691.00s]  You got it.
[12691.00s -> 12700.30s]  Baby loves this move.
[12700.30s -> 12700.80s]  Yeah.
[12707.48s -> 12718.90s]  Oh, baby loves the arm pump.
[12718.90s -> 12719.86s]  Scream at the baby.
[12721.69s -> 12723.77s]  I don't think you can scream at the baby.
[12723.77s -> 12726.50s]  Wait, you can.
[12731.21s -> 12732.33s]  Oh, wait, I'm sorry.
[12732.33s -> 12732.73s]  I'm sorry.
[12732.73s -> 12733.29s]  Remember this?
[12737.64s -> 12738.28s]  Oh, God.
[12738.68s -> 12739.32s]  Everything's okay.
[12739.32s -> 12739.88s]  Everything's okay.
[12748.57s -> 12749.29s]  No, sorry.
[12749.29s -> 12752.49s]  I am not going to vortex the baby.
[12766.47s -> 12766.79s]  All right.
[12767.91s -> 12773.46s]  I love how he's scary.
[12773.46s -> 12773.96s]  Whoa.
[12774.66s -> 12780.42s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[12780.42s -> 12781.38s]  Does the baby like farts?
[12795.85s -> 12796.89s]  You like to dance, baby?
[12806.02s -> 12806.34s]  All right.
[12806.34s -> 12809.46s]  So is this the part that we all have to come to terms with?
[12809.46s -> 12812.14s]  I probably ain't ever coming back here.
[12812.14s -> 12814.41s]  I'm going to forget where this house is.
[12814.41s -> 12818.41s]  So this is like all the only time I'm probably going to be here.
[12818.41s -> 12819.77s]  What happened?
[12825.24s -> 12826.84s]  Turn safety on, please.
[12831.43s -> 12833.51s]  Can I beg for money from the baby?
[12833.51s -> 12847.27s]  What about dog?
[12847.27s -> 12851.88s]  Come on, baby.
[12851.88s -> 12852.60s]  I need some cash.
[12854.55s -> 12854.95s]  Something.
[12854.95s -> 12871.11s]  Anything.
[12871.11s -> 12871.59s]  We're fine.
[12871.59s -> 12871.83s]  All right.
[12871.83s -> 12872.79s]  More info.
[12872.79s -> 12875.61s]  The baby thinks I'm ugly.
[12877.05s -> 12877.21s]  Okay.
[12877.21s -> 12878.81s]  We need to get beef jerky.
[12878.81s -> 12881.00s]  All right.
[12881.00s -> 12882.28s]  Let's give a gift to the baby.
[12882.28s -> 12883.32s]  And I'm going to leave.
[12883.32s -> 12885.08s]  What is this?
[12885.08s -> 12886.55s]  Quests.
[12886.55s -> 12887.19s]  Families.
[12887.19s -> 12887.83s]  Wait, what do you mean?
[12887.83s -> 12889.19s]  Families, plural.
[12889.19s -> 12894.42s]  Family has a gift for you.
[12894.42s -> 12895.06s]  They do?
[12895.06s -> 12897.14s]  Who's got a gift?
[12904.81s -> 12905.29s]  Let's see it.
[12917.59s -> 12918.97s]  All right.
[12918.97s -> 12920.09s]  What does the baby want?
[12920.09s -> 12922.73s]  Some beef jerky, right?
[12929.08s -> 12931.00s]  I mean, I buy all the expired food.
[12931.00s -> 12931.32s]  I don't care.
[12931.32s -> 12931.88s]  I want to get huge.
[12937.99s -> 12943.45s]  How fat can you actually get in the game?
[12947.90s -> 12950.20s]  Feed the baby the flesh pie.
[12951.27s -> 12952.95s]  Well, you're crazy.
[12952.95s -> 12957.67s]  No, I don't think I'm not gaining any weight.
[12957.67s -> 12960.04s]  Look at the log book.
[12960.68s -> 12963.82s]  Yeah, I'm as fat as you can be.
[12965.50s -> 12971.62s]  Good.
[12971.62s -> 12971.86s]  Okay.
[12971.86s -> 12973.30s]  Look, I'm good and I'm pure.
[12974.10s -> 12975.64s]  My renown is good.
[12977.99s -> 12979.27s]  My attractiveness is okay.
[12979.99s -> 12982.41s]  Where's my fat skill?
[12991.75s -> 12993.19s]  Where's fatness?
[12994.07s -> 12995.03s]  Minus 26.
[12995.03s -> 12995.91s]  It can be more than that.
[12996.63s -> 13005.10s]  It can definitely be more than that.
[13010.34s -> 13017.82s]  What's the fattiest thing in the whole game?
[13018.62s -> 13027.16s]  Level 26 fat guy.
[13034.74s -> 13034.98s]  Five.
[13035.70s -> 13036.02s]  Ten.
[13036.02s -> 13037.38s]  Oh no, it is working, isn't it?
[13038.02s -> 13038.66s]  Yeah, it's working.
[13039.22s -> 13042.74s]  Minus 30 is the lowest you can go.
[13042.74s -> 13042.98s]  All right.
[13042.98s -> 13043.86s]  Well, it's probably there now.
[13051.26s -> 13051.50s]  All right.
[13051.50s -> 13052.14s]  Let's keep going.
[13052.78s -> 13054.20s]  Let's do the quest.
[13054.84s -> 13062.06s]  Move close so we can see.
[13062.78s -> 13064.50s]  No, I like this outfit.
[13064.50s -> 13065.14s]  I'm keeping it on.
[13065.78s -> 13068.57s]  Drink the EXP potions.
[13068.57s -> 13069.93s]  That's a great idea.
[13069.93s -> 13072.98s]  All right.
[13072.98s -> 13073.94s]  This is Will potion.
[13075.34s -> 13075.82s]  Oh yeah.
[13087.53s -> 13088.33s]  Strength one, two.
[13089.05s -> 13093.30s]  Okay.
[13093.30s -> 13095.86s]  I've got enough experience now to do what?
[13098.12s -> 13099.80s]  I do physique.
[13100.60s -> 13101.62s]  It's just more damage.
[13101.62s -> 13102.34s]  What about tough now?
[13102.34s -> 13102.66s]  Let me do...
[13103.78s -> 13105.88s]  Yeah, I'll do physique.
[13105.88s -> 13107.59s]  More damage.
[13107.59s -> 13108.15s]  Let's go to Will.
[13108.71s -> 13110.36s]  All right.
[13110.36s -> 13112.04s]  I don't have enough to do very much anything.
[13117.77s -> 13118.89s]  14,000.
[13118.89s -> 13119.29s]  Jesus.
[13120.49s -> 13122.09s]  I should do shock too.
[13128.76s -> 13129.96s]  Time control sounds cool.
[13129.96s -> 13130.52s]  Yeah, it does.
[13131.48s -> 13131.88s]  All right.
[13133.56s -> 13134.76s]  What is it, honey?
[13139.26s -> 13139.58s]  Yeah.
[13139.58s -> 13141.02s]  You see how many fist pumps I did?
[13141.83s -> 13141.99s]  Here.
[13141.99s -> 13142.55s]  Do you want something?
[13142.55s -> 13142.79s]  Here.
[13142.79s -> 13142.95s]  Take...
[13144.89s -> 13145.05s]  Take...
[13146.09s -> 13147.08s]  Here.
[13147.08s -> 13147.96s]  Have a piece of chocolate.
[13148.52s -> 13153.91s]  All right.
[13153.91s -> 13154.87s]  What does it want me to do in here?
[13155.59s -> 13159.27s]  What do you want me to do in here?
[13159.83s -> 13161.80s]  I got to change the quest.
[13164.28s -> 13164.68s]  Okay.
[13164.68s -> 13165.32s]  I'm going to do...
[13166.12s -> 13167.64s]  Talk to the abbot in Oakfield.
[13169.72s -> 13170.28s]  Sculptor.
[13170.84s -> 13173.48s]  Let's do the...
[13174.28s -> 13174.76s]  Sculptor.
[13174.76s -> 13175.00s]  Yeah.
[13187.38s -> 13188.26s]  Oh, weapons guy.
[13192.36s -> 13192.92s]  What do you got?
[13193.48s -> 13195.59s]  How much money?
[13195.59s -> 13196.39s]  I got 4,500.
[13197.19s -> 13197.83s]  Iron axe.
[13198.47s -> 13200.34s]  That's pretty good.
[13200.34s -> 13201.38s]  Iron blunderbuss.
[13201.38s -> 13201.62s]  Ooh.
[13203.21s -> 13204.49s]  Steel axe.
[13204.49s -> 13205.99s]  Can I take it?
[13206.55s -> 13208.89s]  Give me the gun.
[13216.20s -> 13216.92s]  And give me the...
[13217.96s -> 13222.81s]  Iron axe.
[13224.25s -> 13227.94s]  You're paying top gold for top quality items.
[13227.94s -> 13228.34s]  Here we go.
[13228.34s -> 13228.50s]  All right.
[13228.50s -> 13230.78s]  Let's take a look at it.
[13230.78s -> 13231.58s]  And a clothing trader.
[13231.58s -> 13232.22s]  What do you got?
[13232.22s -> 13235.24s]  We have some new things in stock, you might ask.
[13235.24s -> 13236.20s]  Condom.
[13236.20s -> 13236.44s]  No.
[13237.61s -> 13238.41s]  Autograph card.
[13238.41s -> 13239.45s]  Ah, that item is discounted.
[13239.45s -> 13240.68s]  Yeah.
[13240.68s -> 13241.88s]  I'll take a couple of these.
[13241.88s -> 13243.80s]  You've bought a fine item.
[13243.80s -> 13244.36s]  Dog treats.
[13244.36s -> 13244.68s]  Yep.
[13247.26s -> 13249.02s]  You've bought a fine item.
[13249.02s -> 13249.82s]  Wedding bells.
[13250.62s -> 13251.90s]  Sheep flowers.
[13251.90s -> 13252.06s]  Yeah.
[13252.06s -> 13253.18s]  Just get a bunch of random gifts.
[13253.18s -> 13255.26s]  I hope it brings you great happiness.
[13256.38s -> 13258.30s]  You've bought a fine item.
[13258.94s -> 13263.06s]  Oh, I like this.
[13263.86s -> 13264.98s]  Is this a hat?
[13264.98s -> 13266.02s]  It's on sale.
[13266.02s -> 13267.94s]  Oh, bargain.
[13267.94s -> 13273.67s]  I like this.
[13275.51s -> 13278.15s]  You're making a great saving on that.
[13278.71s -> 13282.30s]  Rock bottom prizes for rock bottom times.
[13283.26s -> 13283.58s]  Okay.
[13289.80s -> 13296.86s]  This looks like I had to become a superhero really quickly.
[13296.86s -> 13299.78s]  And I just kind of threw on everything I could find
[13299.78s -> 13310.78s]  in like the closet for everybody that lives in my house.
[13310.78s -> 13311.02s]  All right.
[13311.02s -> 13315.98s]  Let's do it.
[13315.98s -> 13317.02s]  Model for the sculpture.
[13317.02s -> 13317.50s]  Yes.
[13317.50s -> 13319.18s]  Let me take a good look at you.
[13319.18s -> 13322.73s]  Perform and hold an expression.
[13322.73s -> 13324.01s]  Well, I mean, we kind of have to.
[13337.21s -> 13338.17s]  Wait, am I supposed to hold it?
[13353.96s -> 13354.76s]  Keep farting.
[13362.66s -> 13364.50s]  Hey, I got to get out of there.
[13369.88s -> 13376.68s]  Oh, wait, I didn't win.
[13378.94s -> 13380.06s]  Did I win?
[13380.86s -> 13385.14s]  I hope it's me grabbing my butt.
[13404.39s -> 13405.67s]  This is going to get me in trouble.
[13406.39s -> 13407.67s]  I'm going to shock somebody in the face.
[13407.67s -> 13409.03s]  It's going to get me in a lot of trouble.
[13416.82s -> 13417.38s]  Oh, cool.
[13417.38s -> 13417.78s]  All right.
[13417.78s -> 13418.50s]  Nice.
[13418.50s -> 13423.50s]  What's next on the quest?
[13423.50s -> 13423.82s]  All right.
[13423.82s -> 13424.46s]  The ritual.
[13424.46s -> 13424.86s]  Let's go.
[13432.46s -> 13433.42s]  All right, dog.
[13433.42s -> 13436.50s]  Let's go.
[13436.50s -> 13440.49s]  The demon door over here.
[13441.22s -> 13442.10s]  Oh, yeah, I remember those.
[13442.10s -> 13444.50s]  It's like you have to do certain things in front of it.
[13445.22s -> 13446.02s]  Oh, yes.
[13446.66s -> 13448.26s]  You must be fat.
[13448.26s -> 13449.54s]  You must be strong.
[13449.54s -> 13450.90s]  You must be wise.
[13451.70s -> 13453.22s]  I forgot about demon doors.
[13453.22s -> 13462.89s]  Where is it?
[13462.89s -> 13476.34s]  Yeah, the demon doors were the coolest part of the whole game.
[13476.34s -> 13477.70s]  They were everywhere in the first game.
[13480.38s -> 13489.05s]  Where are they in this one?
[13489.05s -> 13489.69s]  Demon door.
[13489.69s -> 13493.32s]  Come on.
[13494.20s -> 13500.30s]  Usually on the side of a rock, like clip, right?
[13500.30s -> 13501.42s]  Like something I can hear.
[13501.42s -> 13509.69s]  Honestly, the demon door was probably the coolest concept.
[13509.69s -> 13515.16s]  I'm surprised nobody else decided to just take it and make a bunch of stuff.
[13515.16s -> 13518.20s]  Make a game based around demon doors like Fable 1 was.
[13518.20s -> 13520.36s]  It was such a cool idea.
[13520.36s -> 13523.69s]  Follow the coast.
[13527.88s -> 13535.70s]  Yeah, because it forced you to play a certain way.
[13535.70s -> 13537.38s]  And if you didn't, here we go.
[13537.38s -> 13537.88s]  All right.
[13553.08s -> 13555.56s]  Oh, hello.
[13555.56s -> 13558.68s]  I wager you have never known a love truer.
[13558.68s -> 13559.32s]  I'm married.
[13559.32s -> 13560.12s]  Open the door, please.
[13560.12s -> 13569.06s]  The purest vibes of such love, even for just a few seconds, would inflate my soul with delight.
[13569.06s -> 13575.03s]  A delicate kiss between pledged lovers is all that I ask.
[13575.67s -> 13579.03s]  Such a sight would surely unlock my pain.
[13579.03s -> 13581.27s]  Okay.
[13581.27s -> 13581.59s]  All right.
[13581.59s -> 13584.25s]  Honey!
[13584.25s -> 13586.57s]  Honey, there's this weird thing in our backyard.
[13586.57s -> 13594.89s]  Where's our house?
[13594.89s -> 13603.45s]  My children speak of all great adventures, but they never utter your name.
[13603.45s -> 13603.85s]  Honey!
[13604.41s -> 13610.39s]  Follow me.
[13610.39s -> 13612.30s]  We have to open this door.
[13612.30s -> 13625.48s]  Where is she?
[13625.48s -> 13628.25s]  Where'd you go?
[13628.25s -> 13632.26s]  All right.
[13632.26s -> 13634.94s]  Honey, I need you to come with me for a minute.
[13634.94s -> 13635.34s]  All right.
[13635.34s -> 13636.06s]  Come with me.
[13636.06s -> 13643.93s]  Follow me, please.
[13643.93s -> 13646.15s]  Um, follow me.
[13646.15s -> 13650.55s]  Can I even kiss you?
[13650.55s -> 13654.07s]  I can't even kiss her.
[13654.87s -> 13657.40s]  How do I unlock kiss?
[13657.96s -> 13660.06s]  How do I kiss her?
[13660.06s -> 13664.02s]  How do I get the kiss expression?
[13670.58s -> 13671.83s]  What?
[13671.83s -> 13675.67s]  I have to go to the bookstore?
[13675.67s -> 13676.71s]  Oh, God.
[13676.71s -> 13677.03s]  Okay.
[13677.03s -> 13678.07s]  Well, just stay here then.
[13678.63s -> 13679.75s]  Remind me if this exists.
[13692.84s -> 13695.32s]  The time is very late.
[13696.12s -> 13696.76s]  Okay, let's go.
[13697.32s -> 13698.60s]  Remind me if that exists.
[13698.60s -> 13704.14s]  She doesn't even like you enough?
[13704.86s -> 13705.58s]  We're married.
[13706.22s -> 13724.15s]  It's a loveless marriage.
[13731.96s -> 13732.60s]  Oh.
[13732.60s -> 13733.83s]  Bandage.
[13749.61s -> 13755.75s]  I have two keys.
[13755.75s -> 13756.63s]  Minus 25.
[13756.63s -> 13757.99s]  Oh, for the house.
[13763.91s -> 13764.95s]  Temple of light.
[13774.65s -> 13775.13s]  Who are you?
[13791.35s -> 13795.27s]  The sacred texts clearly say that only two monks might enter the cave.
[13795.27s -> 13795.99s]  No one else.
[13797.43s -> 13800.47s]  I'll not send my only child into unknown dangers.
[13802.55s -> 13806.39s]  What do you need?
[13807.03s -> 13808.87s]  Hello there, my child.
[13808.87s -> 13811.59s]  I wonder.
[13811.59s -> 13812.63s]  Brothers, leave us.
[13816.28s -> 13822.34s]  Let me take a look at you for a moment.
[13822.34s -> 13824.02s]  Quite imposing.
[13824.02s -> 13826.02s]  But I can't send just anyone in there.
[13828.50s -> 13831.14s]  I suppose danger is not everyone's cup of tea.
[13831.86s -> 13833.91s]  You look imposing all right.
[13833.91s -> 13837.75s]  But I can't entrust our community's survival to a complete stranger.
[13837.75s -> 13838.23s]  Why not?
[13838.95s -> 13843.03s]  Perhaps if you built up a reputation, I'd be more inclined to trust you.
[13844.31s -> 13844.63s]  Yes.
[13845.67s -> 13848.87s]  Rookridge has been having a horrible time with bandits lately.
[13850.07s -> 13853.43s]  Why don't you go to the tavern and see if you can do anything about them?
[13853.43s -> 13854.71s]  That would be a good start.
[13856.25s -> 13858.97s]  The blessing must go forward if you're to find the pilgrim.
[13859.61s -> 13861.13s]  You must gain the abbot's favor.
[13861.13s -> 13862.01s]  Oh, fine.
[13862.01s -> 13864.49s]  Perhaps you can find a way to impress him in the town.
[13864.49s -> 13865.37s]  Impress him?
[13865.37s -> 13867.93s]  Use your map to see where quests and jobs are.
[13867.93s -> 13868.73s]  He has a quest.
[13869.53s -> 13874.34s]  A bridge too far.
[13875.06s -> 13877.22s]  Fight the bandits in Rookridge.
[13877.22s -> 13877.54s]  Sure.
[13878.74s -> 13891.46s]  I don't have to go up here.
[13900.44s -> 13901.88s]  Let me help you.
[13901.88s -> 13903.00s]  Can I help you?
[13903.00s -> 13905.06s]  You want a deed?
[13905.06s -> 13906.26s]  You want to get a deed back?
[13906.26s -> 13906.98s]  I can get a deed.
[13910.66s -> 13911.54s]  I got you want to get a deed?
[13911.54s -> 13911.94s]  I can get it.
[13911.94s -> 13912.50s]  You want to get the deed?
[13912.50s -> 13913.46s]  I can get the deed, man.
[13913.46s -> 13920.94s]  Bet your ass I will.
[13924.95s -> 13925.45s]  Mm-hmm.
[13934.17s -> 13935.13s]  Oh, I don't even need to...
[13935.13s -> 13937.21s]  Look, all you need to say is get rid of the people at this location.
[13937.21s -> 13941.00s]  That's all you need.
[13941.00s -> 13942.52s]  I don't need any other info, man.
[13942.52s -> 13945.88s]  I'm gonna go literally blow their heads off with a shotgun
[13945.88s -> 13948.28s]  and I'm gonna kill them with electricity and shit.
[13948.28s -> 13948.68s]  Just wait.
[13948.68s -> 13949.56s]  Don't worry.
[13949.56s -> 13950.12s]  I'm the hero.
[13953.74s -> 13955.02s]  Any Aaron chatters?
[13955.74s -> 13956.22s]  Probably.
[13956.78s -> 13957.90s]  Or your shit load of you.
[13978.39s -> 13978.95s]  Okay.
[13978.95s -> 13979.59s]  Bandits.
[13979.59s -> 13980.31s]  Let's go.
[13980.31s -> 13990.07s]  You didn't say it in the funny voice?
[13991.03s -> 13993.85s]  No, that wasn't even the right one.
[13993.85s -> 13994.41s]  Aaron!
[13994.41s -> 13994.91s]  There you go.
[13995.77s -> 13996.97s]  You get that like once a week.
[14002.95s -> 14003.59s]  Any treasure?
[14003.59s -> 14004.39s]  Nope.
[14004.39s -> 14005.59s]  All right, what's on my bar right now?
[14007.40s -> 14007.96s]  Vortex.
[14007.96s -> 14009.08s]  Yeah, you better believe it.
[14009.64s -> 14011.90s]  Vortex into shotgun.
[14011.90s -> 14019.11s]  Tell the boss?
[14019.75s -> 14024.31s]  All right, let's go kick some fucking butt.
[14035.43s -> 14038.71s]  Bring back Super Frog.
[14038.71s -> 14039.51s]  I love Super Frog.
[14039.51s -> 14040.55s]  It's like one of my favorite characters.
[14045.02s -> 14046.33s]  That's it?
[14047.27s -> 14047.75s]  Get him.
[14049.48s -> 14051.40s]  Okay, come on down the stairs then.
[14058.90s -> 14060.02s]  Let's make a tornado.
[14068.44s -> 14069.56s]  This is slow motion.
[14079.32s -> 14079.96s]  How?
[14079.96s -> 14092.71s]  Don't even use the weapon.
[14092.71s -> 14094.07s]  What's the point of using the weapon?
[14094.07s -> 14104.57s]  Oh, that's purple.
[14104.57s -> 14105.37s]  That's beautiful.
[14105.37s -> 14106.01s]  That's awesome.
[14106.73s -> 14110.25s]  That's just shit.
[14110.25s -> 14111.13s]  Fly him around.
[14111.13s -> 14111.63s]  Zapper.
[14112.66s -> 14113.16s]  Shotgun.
[14127.77s -> 14128.57s]  I love this voice.
[14140.15s -> 14141.03s]  I love this guy.
[14159.37s -> 14160.01s]  Come on, boy.
[14169.48s -> 14170.92s]  His voice is so wild.
[14170.92s -> 14171.42s]  I love it.
[14171.96s -> 14177.03s]  I've never heard that guy before.
[14177.03s -> 14177.83s]  What the fuck?
[14178.63s -> 14188.17s]  And Vortex is pretty helpful.
[14188.17s -> 14205.40s]  I'm just eating.
[14205.40s -> 14218.42s]  He's in a- this guy's in a lot of TV shows.
[14218.42s -> 14224.55s]  Really?
[14224.55s -> 14226.31s]  When is he going to kill the baby?
[14227.45s -> 14231.50s]  I know most of you are probably only still on this stream.
[14231.50s -> 14232.62s]  You're only probably still here.
[14233.86s -> 14237.22s]  Because you are thinking at some point I'm going to have safety off
[14237.22s -> 14238.50s]  and I'm going to kill the baby.
[14239.66s -> 14242.94s]  I- I think that's why a bunch of you are still here.
[14242.94s -> 14246.82s]  Because you don't want to miss when like the guy kills the baby.
[14246.82s -> 14247.56s]  You know what I mean?
[14247.56s -> 14249.16s]  Like, it's not going to happen though.
[14249.16s -> 14261.45s]  I'm just- I'm not happening.
[14261.45s -> 14263.61s]  Like, I really doubt that's going to happen.
[14263.61s -> 14273.58s]  Why do you think they call me Dash?
[14274.22s -> 14276.14s]  I'll be a moil away from you before you-
[14277.74s -> 14298.01s]  He'll die already.
[14298.01s -> 14299.69s]  Ow.
[14299.69s -> 14310.70s]  Is he dead?
[14310.70s -> 14316.50s]  Thank god that guy took so many hits.
[14316.50s -> 14322.84s]  Imagine getting your ass kicked by a guy that looks like this.
[14323.56s -> 14329.24s]  I mean, this- if anybody's shooting lightning out of their hands.
[14338.49s -> 14341.69s]  Whoa.
[14342.41s -> 14344.17s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[14344.17s -> 14348.36s]  It's in the fucking tornado.
[14348.36s -> 14348.76s]  Let's go.
[14349.56s -> 14367.05s]  Heal the dog?
[14367.05s -> 14367.53s]  I'll get it.
[14367.53s -> 14368.25s]  I'll get the dog.
[14368.25s -> 14368.49s]  All right.
[14368.49s -> 14375.45s]  Come here, dog.
[14375.45s -> 14376.73s]  I have a dog treat for you, right?
[14376.73s -> 14377.53s]  Come here.
[14377.53s -> 14379.06s]  How do I do it?
[14379.06s -> 14380.62s]  Can I not do it?
[14380.62s -> 14381.58s]  Use dog elixir.
[14381.58s -> 14382.86s]  I don't have a dog elixir, do I?
[14383.42s -> 14393.90s]  It says feed and kill the bandit dog.
[14396.02s -> 14396.66s]  What the fuck?
[14396.66s -> 14400.81s]  All right.
[14400.81s -> 14402.01s]  I want shock too.
[14402.82s -> 14405.37s]  Yep.
[14405.37s -> 14406.97s]  I had to spend all my money but I want it.
[14409.64s -> 14410.84s]  How about speed?
[14411.90s -> 14412.46s]  Accuracy?
[14413.18s -> 14413.42s]  Yeah.
[14420.52s -> 14421.90s]  All right.
[14421.90s -> 14422.70s]  How much better is this?
[14424.71s -> 14425.91s]  So if I have level two.
[14426.87s -> 14429.40s]  All right.
[14429.40s -> 14430.60s]  So we're gonna have to change this, I think.
[14431.16s -> 14435.46s]  I want this to be lightning and we'll do-
[14436.02s -> 14437.14s]  Yeah, that- because that's kind of cool.
[14437.14s -> 14439.22s]  And then we get them with the thing and we just fucking zap them.
[14439.86s -> 14440.18s]  Perfect.
[14440.18s -> 14440.34s]  All right.
[14440.34s -> 14440.66s]  Let's go.
[14441.30s -> 14451.50s]  Oh, do you like this game?
[14451.50s -> 14451.74s]  Yeah.
[14453.27s -> 14454.23s]  It's keeping my attention.
[14454.23s -> 14454.71s]  It's funny.
[14464.06s -> 14465.66s]  Resurrection file.
[14465.66s -> 14468.65s]  Keep one of these in your inventory.
[14468.65s -> 14471.61s]  Should your health drop to zero, the resurrection file will automatically revive you.
[14473.16s -> 14474.52s]  Well, that's kind of a big deal.
[14474.52s -> 14474.84s]  All right.
[14474.84s -> 14475.16s]  Let's go.
[14475.80s -> 14478.25s]  It's a funny fart game.
[14478.25s -> 14479.13s]  Of course we like it.
[14481.61s -> 14485.11s]  I mean, that's the- I mean, that's how I keep you guys here.
[14485.11s -> 14486.71s]  Have you noticed that I've done a fart?
[14486.71s -> 14488.31s]  I've like farted into the microphone.
[14490.71s -> 14493.51s]  Like every maybe 30 minutes or so as it gets to keep you here.
[14500.49s -> 14502.17s]  Ooh, I like it.
[14502.17s -> 14502.57s]  It's good.
[14503.37s -> 14514.41s]  Where's my dog?
[14514.41s -> 14542.71s]  You can tell the health of the dog by the tail.
[14542.71s -> 14543.83s]  We would be here regardless.
[14543.83s -> 14546.38s]  Hey, that's- hey, thanks.
[14546.38s -> 14547.98s]  Would you- that's cool.
[14547.98s -> 14548.30s]  Thanks.
[14550.90s -> 14551.78s]  Oh, the dog's on him.
[14558.06s -> 14558.70s]  But I killed him?
[14561.66s -> 14562.30s]  What?
[14562.30s -> 14568.84s]  I guess I- I mean, I guess that death would kill him.
[14576.20s -> 14576.76s]  Oh, okay.
[14579.74s -> 14581.99s]  Whatever.
[14581.99s -> 14582.87s]  No boss fight.
[14582.87s -> 14583.59s]  I guess not.
[14588.54s -> 14589.18s]  100 bucks?
[14590.31s -> 14591.35s]  Bandit bandana?
[14592.44s -> 14593.16s]  Bandit shirt?
[14593.80s -> 14594.84s]  Bandit trousers?
[14595.64s -> 14597.10s]  I'll just sell this shit.
[14597.10s -> 14598.94s]  I don't want to get- I want to have like a big gown on.
[14599.50s -> 14605.27s]  I need a big like mage gown.
[14605.27s -> 14608.31s]  All right.
[14608.31s -> 14608.87s]  Well, that was good.
[14608.87s -> 14610.87s]  So now I go back and talk to that guy.
[14611.43s -> 14615.99s]  Okay.
[14615.99s -> 14617.69s]  Return to Bonham.
[14617.69s -> 14627.66s]  He killed him and took his clothes.
[14628.30s -> 14637.66s]  I pretended to like this game because my crush liked it.
[14640.57s -> 14648.70s]  Yeah, but it's really- it's not a bad game.
[14648.70s -> 14649.74s]  It's fun.
[14649.74s -> 14661.61s]  All right.
[14661.61s -> 14662.73s]  Hey, look what I did.
[14663.29s -> 14667.19s]  Hey, what do you like?
[14667.19s -> 14667.91s]  Yeah, what do you like?
[14668.71s -> 14670.63s]  I'm trying to hit triangle for more info.
[14670.71s -> 14671.75s]  I don't want to shoot the guy.
[14673.59s -> 14677.70s]  He likes- what do you want- he wants a gift?
[14678.26s -> 14683.08s]  Heroic pose, sock puppet, and shoulder length hair.
[14683.08s -> 14699.69s]  How do I- how do I get the present?
[14699.69s -> 14701.32s]  Does the guy have a present?
[14710.54s -> 14711.02s]  Scare him.
[14714.89s -> 14715.69s]  You have to scare him.
[14726.01s -> 14730.04s]  Ain't so I might, but I'll bounce back.
[14730.04s -> 14730.68s]  Always do.
[14732.07s -> 14735.19s]  Anyway, here's my trusty Thesaurus, as promised.
[14735.19s -> 14735.99s]  Thesaurus?
[14735.99s -> 14738.87s]  You never know when you'll be caught in a lexicological quandary.
[14738.87s -> 14740.15s]  Doesn't tell me how to kiss.
[14740.15s -> 14749.98s]  You got 250 renown, dashes, goggles, and Barnum's Thesaurus.
[14750.54s -> 14759.88s]  Thanks to you, the way to Bowerstone is now open again.
[14759.88s -> 14760.92s]  The archaeologist?
[14760.92s -> 14761.56s]  All right, hold on.
[14762.36s -> 14763.32s]  I'm gonna scare this guy?
[14766.92s -> 14767.96s]  You've done it.
[14767.96s -> 14770.12s]  Almost everyone in Oakfield has heard of you.
[14770.12s -> 14770.84s]  Just slap him?
[14772.73s -> 14774.41s]  Now you can go- did I- I missed?
[14774.41s -> 14777.13s]  What I- I'm trying to do this- the thing on the left is changing.
[14805.38s -> 14811.86s]  Okay, we're almost there.
[14816.25s -> 14817.21s]  All right, now give me a present.
[14819.70s -> 14820.34s]  Give me a present.
[14820.98s -> 14822.98s]  He's re- give me the present.
[14823.78s -> 14835.02s]  Okay, so give me a present.
[14835.02s -> 14835.82s]  I'm on the present.
[14843.88s -> 14844.60s]  A little bit more?
[14848.52s -> 14852.62s]  A little more.
[14854.20s -> 14855.80s]  You trying to give me a heart attack?
[14862.10s -> 14862.82s]  Oh, accept gift.
[14862.82s -> 14863.54s]  There it is.
[14863.54s -> 14866.23s]  Just give me $71.
[14867.75s -> 14868.95s]  Hey, thanks a lot, buddy!
[14871.83s -> 14876.10s]  Thanks for cheering me up.
[14893.43s -> 14895.03s]  I love this one.
[14895.03s -> 14896.63s]  All right, um, let's go.
[14896.63s -> 14902.17s]  I just- oh, I so badly want to throw a tornado in there.
[14902.73s -> 14903.29s]  You know what I mean?
[14903.29s -> 14904.73s]  I just want to throw a tornado in there.
[14910.22s -> 14910.94s]  Any new clothing?
[14914.71s -> 14915.59s]  Wait, I am gonna sell.
[14917.51s -> 14921.29s]  I'm gonna sell the, um, another bandit shit I don't want.
[14921.85s -> 14924.82s]  Bandit shirt.
[14924.82s -> 14925.54s]  I don't want this.
[14926.79s -> 14927.83s]  Bandit trousers.
[14927.83s -> 14928.31s]  Don't want it.
[14932.95s -> 14938.39s]  You know what I mean?
[14938.39s -> 14938.95s]  I know.
[14938.95s -> 14939.59s]  I said that a lot.
[14939.59s -> 14939.83s]  I know.
[14941.99s -> 14945.05s]  All right, do I have enough renown to do what this guy wants me to do?
[14945.69s -> 14950.09s]  Will death do us part?
[14950.09s -> 14954.17s]  Speak to the ghost of a jilted lover and become the- its instrument of vengeance?
[14954.89s -> 14961.03s]  What do I mean in looking for a new model?
[14963.86s -> 14967.69s]  The statue's in front of the inn?
[14967.69s -> 14967.93s]  Oh.
[14968.81s -> 14969.77s]  Well, I'll do this and come back.
[14985.21s -> 14986.01s]  All right.
[14986.01s -> 14988.15s]  Oh, that's right.
[14988.15s -> 14990.39s]  I gotta go back to the blacksmith and do better blacksmithing.
[14990.95s -> 14994.39s]  I need to buy another house.
[14998.68s -> 15007.51s]  Later.
[15007.51s -> 15012.78s]  I'll let him get the jump on me.
[15012.78s -> 15013.10s]  Come on.
[15013.82s -> 15016.78s]  Get in the head.
[15016.78s -> 15023.77s]  I can now afford speed.
[15024.65s -> 15025.85s]  Not yet, though.
[15025.85s -> 15032.41s]  Just want to let you know, I bet my house on whether you're gonna die to the bandits in 30 minutes.
[15032.97s -> 15033.29s]  Please.
[15033.29s -> 15034.73s]  Well, it's been four and a half hours, man.
[15035.37s -> 15036.73s]  I don't think I'm gonna die to the bandits.
[15046.71s -> 15047.19s]  I am.
[15047.99s -> 15049.70s]  Glad of you to notice.
[15063.18s -> 15064.22s]  Oh, good shot.
[15064.78s -> 15065.98s]  Uh-oh.
[15065.98s -> 15070.17s]  All right.
[15070.17s -> 15070.73s]  I gotta run.
[15070.73s -> 15071.37s]  I gotta get up there.
[15077.38s -> 15078.50s]  Hey, why are you roleplaying?
[15079.14s -> 15087.42s]  I can't pretend like I'm in the game and just be like, oh, gotcha.
[15087.98s -> 15088.70s]  Sit down.
[15088.70s -> 15089.26s]  Why not?
[15089.26s -> 15090.14s]  I do this shit all the time.
[15090.14s -> 15091.74s]  Even when I'm not falling off.
[15091.74s -> 15092.98s]  Makes it more interesting.
[15099.53s -> 15100.09s]  E3.
[15101.83s -> 15104.87s]  You know, I still can't figure out the life of me.
[15106.02s -> 15106.98s]  Why they do that?
[15107.78s -> 15108.82s]  Why do they do that?
[15111.88s -> 15115.16s]  Have they ever played a video game before?
[15115.16s -> 15120.12s]  Why do they do the pretend actor wearing a vent call thing?
[15121.64s -> 15122.76s]  Nobody talks like that.
[15125.51s -> 15127.75s]  We all have played a shitload of games together.
[15127.75s -> 15134.25s]  We've played games in parties, online, even in just random lobbies.
[15134.25s -> 15135.77s]  People don't do that.
[15135.77s -> 15136.81s]  No one has ever...
[15136.81s -> 15140.41s]  I don't think the people making that have ever played a video game online.
[15140.97s -> 15150.26s]  But I mean, what's the alternative?
[15150.90s -> 15155.08s]  The alternative is, I guess, how it would really be.
[15155.72s -> 15158.84s]  Which would be turn your volume down really low
[15158.84s -> 15162.04s]  because somebody's going to have a horrible microphone and scream into it.
[15162.04s -> 15163.80s]  You're going to hear somebody get yelled at by their mother.
[15164.52s -> 15168.94s]  You're going to get like the lapel microphone sounds.
[15168.94s -> 15175.21s]  That is the alternative.
[15175.21s -> 15179.67s]  And maybe every like two or three minutes you'll hear...
[15180.82s -> 15181.78s]  The fuck, dude.
[15186.70s -> 15187.98s]  Fucking help me.
[15187.98s -> 15188.78s]  Fucking idiot.
[15191.91s -> 15192.79s]  Fuck.
[15192.79s -> 15196.28s]  Is it?
[15196.28s -> 15197.48s]  Or this.
[15212.26s -> 15213.06s]  What's more interesting?
[15213.46s -> 15213.94s]  Watch out.
[15213.94s -> 15214.66s]  Watch your six.
[15215.22s -> 15216.39s]  I'm right behind you.
[15216.39s -> 15216.87s]  I got it.
[15217.75s -> 15218.55s]  Going to the alt?
[15218.55s -> 15219.59s]  I sure am.
[15219.59s -> 15222.22s]  I guess that is kind of more interesting.
[15230.22s -> 15230.94s]  Oh, my statue.
[15247.29s -> 15249.61s]  Oh, it's a German 985 stream.
[15250.25s -> 15251.85s]  There's going to be a fat guy if it's possible.
[15252.49s -> 15255.90s]  Oh, my God.
[15255.90s -> 15256.70s]  Kubrick's there.
[15281.45s -> 15284.26s]  What happened?
[15284.26s -> 15286.18s]  The big day came and what?
[15286.82s -> 15292.20s]  All right, I'll help you.
[15301.51s -> 15302.55s]  Oh, I have a wife.
[15304.63s -> 15307.91s]  Then when she's ready to accept your proposal,
[15307.91s -> 15311.75s]  when she can't imagine her life without you, give her this.
[15312.55s -> 15315.18s]  Why don't I just like tell this guy to fuck off?
[15315.18s -> 15316.62s]  Rejection note?
[15316.62s -> 15318.14s]  Dear Alex, it's time for you to know the truth.
[15318.14s -> 15318.78s]  I don't love you.
[15318.78s -> 15319.42s]  I've never loved you.
[15319.42s -> 15320.38s]  This was all a game for me.
[15320.38s -> 15321.98s]  You are empty and deceitful,
[15321.98s -> 15324.54s]  and I hope you never find the slightest glimmer of happiness in this life.
[15325.58s -> 15331.53s]  I've spent a long time thinking of the exact right word,
[15331.53s -> 15333.69s]  and even longer getting it onto paper.
[15334.17s -> 15339.69s]  I am, which makes it all the more impressive that I managed to get this too.
[15340.57s -> 15341.21s]  Are you blue?
[15343.30s -> 15344.10s]  Wedding bells?
[15347.85s -> 15348.33s]  Oh, okay.
[15348.81s -> 15355.70s]  In case you need the help or no idea.
[15355.70s -> 15356.82s]  The art of seduction.
[15359.67s -> 15360.71s]  I have to read all these books.
[15366.41s -> 15366.73s]  Books.
[15367.29s -> 15368.54s]  The mage.
[15369.18s -> 15373.90s]  The mage follows where wisdom leads, but always into conflict.
[15373.90s -> 15376.46s]  Making an ally of this hero will cost you much.
[15380.14s -> 15380.70s]  The pilgrim.
[15381.34s -> 15381.98s]  The relic.
[15381.98s -> 15382.54s]  The thief.
[15383.10s -> 15384.30s]  The rejection note.
[15384.30s -> 15385.42s]  The temple of shadows.
[15385.42s -> 15385.90s]  The end.
[15385.90s -> 15386.22s]  Hold on.
[15386.22s -> 15386.94s]  Temple of shadows.
[15387.50s -> 15389.32s]  Can't read it?
[15391.29s -> 15391.69s]  Journal.
[15391.69s -> 15392.25s]  Wedding bells.
[15392.25s -> 15392.57s]  Read it.
[15393.69s -> 15394.57s]  Oakvale.
[15394.57s -> 15395.61s]  Thesaurus.
[15395.61s -> 15396.09s]  Seduction.
[15396.81s -> 15397.45s]  What did I just do?
[15398.95s -> 15399.59s]  Seduce.
[15400.39s -> 15406.52s]  All right, let's go seduce.
[15406.52s -> 15421.67s]  I think that was a really weird path that I just ran.
[15422.31s -> 15427.77s]  Trey the ghost?
[15428.41s -> 15431.61s]  We'll see.
[15431.61s -> 15432.33s]  We'll see what happens.
[15440.50s -> 15441.94s]  Thaustun.
[15441.94s -> 15448.70s]  Has he killed the baby yet?
[15449.34s -> 15453.80s]  You'll have to go.
[15453.80s -> 15454.44s]  You'll have to watch.
[15460.23s -> 15460.79s]  Fifteen.
[15461.35s -> 15462.47s]  Is that fifteen or five?
[15465.46s -> 15467.06s]  Wait, I have five silver keys?
[15467.06s -> 15468.26s]  When did I get five?
[15468.26s -> 15469.14s]  I thought I had like four.
[15469.70s -> 15471.45s]  Oh shit, nice.
[15472.01s -> 15479.05s]  All right, let's go seduce.
[15479.85s -> 15490.82s]  Here we go.
[15491.46s -> 15492.94s]  Where is Alex?
[15498.86s -> 15499.34s]  Who did that?
[15499.34s -> 15499.90s]  I didn't do that.
[15500.62s -> 15509.43s]  Get the kiss emote.
[15509.43s -> 15510.55s]  It's a book in this library.
[15510.55s -> 15513.24s]  Okay, I'll get it.
[15513.88s -> 15524.55s]  I feel like the breadcrumbs in this game were made for gamers like you.
[15524.55s -> 15525.03s]  They were.
[15525.59s -> 15526.63s]  I wish it was in every game.
[15527.43s -> 15534.79s]  What was that game where you could, if you pressed like down on the d-pad,
[15534.79s -> 15537.11s]  it was like and it did a little line on the ground.
[15537.11s -> 15537.67s]  Dead space.
[15538.63s -> 15540.47s]  Dead space is like the best game ever made.
[15540.47s -> 15544.57s]  You don't, you only use it when you need it.
[15544.57s -> 15549.51s]  It was awesome.
[15549.51s -> 15550.63s]  You never got lost.
[15550.63s -> 15551.27s]  It was perfect.
[15551.27s -> 15553.27s]  Oh, I want you to pay attention, gamer.
[15553.27s -> 15553.99s]  No, I don't care.
[15553.99s -> 15555.11s]  Just show me where to go.
[15555.11s -> 15560.15s]  All right.
[15562.46s -> 15563.74s]  Hi, I'm here to talk to you.
[15573.51s -> 15573.83s]  Hi.
[15581.03s -> 15583.05s]  Okay.
[15595.37s -> 15596.01s]  Wait, what?
[15596.01s -> 15596.65s]  Oh, gambling.
[15596.65s -> 15604.02s]  Hold on.
[15604.02s -> 15604.66s]  Keystone.
[15606.90s -> 15608.10s]  Oh, it's roulette.
[15609.46s -> 15616.76s]  I don't remember all this shit in this game.
[15617.40s -> 15625.86s]  I think I have an idea of how this works.
[15626.58s -> 15641.35s]  Okay, I want, let's go 15 inside bets.
[15641.99s -> 15647.93s]  Let's do 15 and then let's go.
[15651.24s -> 15651.88s]  Seven.
[15651.88s -> 15659.35s]  All right.
[15659.43s -> 15665.10s]  We're going 13.
[15665.10s -> 15673.34s]  Red.
[15673.34s -> 15673.82s]  Trips.
[15673.82s -> 15674.70s]  I don't even know what this means.
[15674.70s -> 15675.26s]  Go.
[15675.26s -> 15680.86s]  What's that?
[15680.86s -> 15681.26s]  Eight.
[15681.26s -> 15682.22s]  What's that going?
[15682.22s -> 15690.76s]  Wife and child are at home eating rotten food.
[15693.30s -> 15694.26s]  Fifteen.
[15694.26s -> 15695.74s]  Twelve to seventeen.
[15697.94s -> 15698.58s]  Run.
[15698.58s -> 15703.45s]  Roll dice.
[15703.45s -> 15704.09s]  Eleven.
[15704.09s -> 15722.25s]  Oh, fifteen.
[15722.25s -> 15723.05s]  Thank you.
[15723.05s -> 15724.42s]  This is close enough.
[15724.42s -> 15729.61s]  What's that pay?
[15729.61s -> 15730.57s]  Twenty-five.
[15730.57s -> 15747.38s]  Hey, you can't lose if you put it on like almost everything.
[15747.38s -> 15757.72s]  Oh, fuck.
[15767.40s -> 15789.05s]  Oh, get more chips.
[15789.05s -> 15789.77s]  Eleven.
[15789.77s -> 15793.59s]  I got it.
[15793.59s -> 15794.15s]  I got one.
[15794.15s -> 15795.93s]  What's that get me?
[15795.93s -> 15800.26s]  Twenty-one and twenty.
[15800.26s -> 15801.61s]  All right.
[15801.61s -> 15802.17s]  Look at that.
[15802.17s -> 15807.53s]  Let's go with eight.
[15807.53s -> 15818.23s]  Seven.
[15818.23s -> 15818.63s]  Got it.
[15818.63s -> 15821.42s]  All right.
[15821.42s -> 15822.22s]  What's that going to get me?
[15822.22s -> 15824.87s]  One hundred and forty.
[15824.87s -> 15825.51s]  Let's go.
[15825.51s -> 15831.16s]  I need to level up my gambling skill.
[15831.16s -> 15832.44s]  Ten.
[15832.44s -> 15836.58s]  Pair and keystone.
[15836.58s -> 15838.02s]  I don't even know what that means, but sure.
[15838.02s -> 15841.43s]  There it is.
[15841.43s -> 15854.52s]  Oh, eleven.
[15854.52s -> 15855.86s]  Keystone.
[15855.86s -> 15861.74s]  There it is.
[15861.74s -> 15863.06s]  I can't fucking count.
[15863.06s -> 15863.54s]  I know.
[15863.54s -> 15864.02s]  I know.
[15864.02s -> 15864.74s]  I can't do math.
[15864.74s -> 15866.02s]  I can't do math ever.
[15866.02s -> 15872.33s]  It's impossible.
[15872.33s -> 15874.04s]  Ten.
[15874.04s -> 15875.21s]  Eleven.
[15875.21s -> 15876.49s]  Keystone.
[15876.49s -> 15878.81s]  Pair and trips.
[15878.81s -> 15883.14s]  That's trips.
[15883.14s -> 15883.86s]  No, it's not.
[15883.86s -> 15899.93s]  Come on.
[15899.93s -> 15903.29s]  Put it on there.
[15903.29s -> 15904.97s]  I mean, if I get triples,
[15904.97s -> 15908.81s]  that's probably like a hundred and one.
[15908.81s -> 15909.45s]  There we go.
[15909.45s -> 15909.85s]  All right.
[15909.85s -> 15910.65s]  That's a big deal.
[15910.65s -> 15912.28s]  That's a big deal.
[15912.28s -> 15913.98s]  That's eighty.
[15913.98s -> 15914.46s]  That's forty.
[15914.46s -> 15914.94s]  That's a hundred.
[15914.94s -> 15916.30s]  That's not even that much.
[15916.30s -> 15927.42s]  Trips will hit huge if it lands.
[15927.42s -> 15931.16s]  All right.
[15931.16s -> 15931.56s]  I'm done.
[15931.56s -> 15934.01s]  I'm done.
[15934.01s -> 15951.08s]  This is just stupid.
[15951.08s -> 15951.32s]  Okay.
[15951.32s -> 15952.92s]  Sixty hundred points to the next level.
[15952.92s -> 15961.74s]  Build up a ton of debt.
[15961.74s -> 15964.28s]  I feel like that people will come after me.
[15964.28s -> 15964.44s]  All right.
[15964.44s -> 15966.60s]  Where's the lady I need to seduce?
[15966.60s -> 15972.73s]  I don't remember even who it is.
[15972.73s -> 15972.97s]  Alex.
[15972.97s -> 15973.21s]  Okay.
[15973.21s -> 15973.53s]  There we go.
[15979.59s -> 15982.68s]  All right.
[15982.68s -> 15983.48s]  What do you like?
[15983.48s -> 15985.69s]  He doesn't like play dead.
[15985.69s -> 15987.51s]  Oh, I have flowers.
[15987.51s -> 15989.02s]  I actually picked flowers.
[15989.02s -> 15989.42s]  I have them.
[15993.46s -> 15994.10s]  All right.
[15994.10s -> 15996.30s]  I have cheap flowers.
[15996.30s -> 15996.62s]  Here.
[16012.31s -> 16012.47s]  All right.
[16012.47s -> 16012.87s]  Let's go.
[16012.87s -> 16013.19s]  Come on.
[16018.23s -> 16019.67s]  That was the magic bullet voice.
[16021.59s -> 16024.15s]  That was absolutely fantastic.
[16024.95s -> 16027.75s]  And you have here a virgin strawberry.
[16027.75s -> 16033.99s]  Why does it want me to fart now?
[16042.87s -> 16043.35s]  Creepy.
[16049.62s -> 16050.18s]  Okay.
[16050.18s -> 16051.22s]  Convince her to marry you.
[16061.54s -> 16063.54s]  I almost got married once before.
[16064.26s -> 16067.86s]  He was a sweet boy, but we were both so young.
[16067.86s -> 16068.82s]  Too young.
[16068.82s -> 16072.34s]  I got scared and ran away the day of the wedding.
[16073.38s -> 16075.38s]  I hurt him so badly.
[16075.38s -> 16077.14s]  He took his own life.
[16077.14s -> 16079.62s]  I've carried that guilt with me all these years.
[16079.62s -> 16080.98s]  Never dreaming I could love again.
[16080.98s -> 16082.34s]  Can I get some fucking space?
[16082.34s -> 16083.06s]  Get away from me.
[16087.80s -> 16089.59s]  Uh, what do I do?
[16090.23s -> 16093.10s]  Destroy the rejection note and marry-
[16093.10s -> 16095.18s]  I have a wife and kid back at the-
[16096.06s -> 16096.78s]  At the house.
[16097.58s -> 16112.23s]  Somebody just wrote, dude, what the fuck?
[16112.23s -> 16114.47s]  Why is your character so gross and weird?
[16114.47s -> 16115.11s]  I don't know.
[16115.11s -> 16116.47s]  I don't know why that made me laugh so hard.
[16118.60s -> 16119.72s]  Kill this person?
[16119.72s -> 16121.08s]  No, although I didn't kill her.
[16121.72s -> 16124.46s]  Can you be married twice?
[16124.46s -> 16135.16s]  Would you like a drink?
[16135.16s -> 16139.16s]  The temples of light and shadows are always at each other's throats.
[16140.44s -> 16143.08s]  Being low on gold isn't much fun, is it?
[16143.08s -> 16143.88s]  Is he-
[16143.88s -> 16144.28s]  Is he-
[16144.28s -> 16146.28s]  Look at the size of you.
[16146.28s -> 16148.36s]  How do you go adventuring with them all?
[16148.36s -> 16149.40s]  You're engaged?
[16149.40s -> 16149.56s]  What?
[16149.64s -> 16151.80s]  I'll be your wife.
[16151.80s -> 16154.12s]  Wait, can I bring her back to the m-
[16154.12s -> 16155.16s]  To my house?
[16156.04s -> 16157.08s]  Wait a minute.
[16157.08s -> 16157.64s]  Wait a minute.
[16158.65s -> 16158.97s]  That-
[16158.97s -> 16160.17s]  Okay, you're joking, right?
[16160.17s -> 16162.89s]  Perhaps you should apply for gender in the same way.
[16162.89s -> 16164.01s]  Do I need to, like-
[16165.56s -> 16166.44s]  I don't understand.
[16166.44s -> 16169.32s]  Can we go back to the other property?
[16171.19s -> 16172.71s]  Can I bring her back?
[16173.67s -> 16176.14s]  Let's romantic for a second.
[16176.14s -> 16177.18s]  Leave me the fuck alone.
[16181.02s -> 16183.18s]  Can I evict myself?
[16184.26s -> 16187.78s]  Can I evict myself from the other house and then move in?
[16187.78s -> 16188.82s]  What happens to the baby?
[16193.85s -> 16194.81s]  I have to buy another house.
[16194.81s -> 16195.45s]  Oh god, okay.
[16196.09s -> 16197.32s]  I don't have any money.
[16202.68s -> 16204.52s]  How much is this one?
[16204.52s -> 16205.72s]  Okay, I don't have enough money.
[16210.14s -> 16210.78s]  Just hold on.
[16210.78s -> 16212.30s]  Let me go blacksmith for like a half an hour.
[16227.18s -> 16227.98s]  Okay, hold on.
[16227.98s -> 16228.94s]  I'll be down in a minute.
[16229.82s -> 16236.20s]  Have another baby?
[16237.00s -> 16242.22s]  So wait, you're telling me that I can just have like a bunch of children
[16242.22s -> 16243.50s]  with a bunch of different people?
[16244.22s -> 16247.80s]  I don't remember doing any of this in the game.
[16248.60s -> 16256.57s]  I just need to get to like six or seven grand.
[16256.57s -> 16260.52s]  This is not gambling.
[16260.52s -> 16261.40s]  This is done.
[16261.40s -> 16262.04s]  It's a job.
[16262.04s -> 16262.52s]  I can do it.
[16262.52s -> 16265.61s]  It's not gambling.
[16265.61s -> 16275.19s]  Create your family line.
[16275.83s -> 16277.27s]  I feel like I'm going to get confused.
[16281.42s -> 16286.02s]  I'm going to forget who is who.
[16286.74s -> 16295.42s]  All right, this is going to not take that long.
[16295.42s -> 16296.14s]  I just can't fuck it up.
[16304.12s -> 16304.84s]  All right, don't screw it up.
[16311.08s -> 16316.02s]  All right, wait for one rotation.
[16319.75s -> 16320.87s]  No need to rush.
[16320.87s -> 16321.51s]  You idiot!
[16321.51s -> 16325.64s]  I just told you not to do that and you did it anyways.
[16325.64s -> 16327.88s]  I was just talking to you.
[16327.88s -> 16328.68s]  Listen to me.
[16328.68s -> 16329.56s]  Why did I do that?
[16338.62s -> 16343.03s]  I'll get it.
[16343.03s -> 16347.98s]  It's because needing to wait that extra one second for some reason
[16347.98s -> 16351.06s]  is an eternity in my brain.
[16351.06s -> 16352.82s]  It's like, oh, it's so much.
[16352.82s -> 16353.62s]  It's so long.
[16353.62s -> 16354.42s]  I have to do it.
[16354.98s -> 16359.05s]  You know what I mean?
[16360.01s -> 16361.29s]  It's 100 years in my head.
[16370.18s -> 16370.82s]  Oh, OK.
[16372.02s -> 16374.46s]  I need what, 10 grand?
[16374.46s -> 16375.20s]  I'll get it.
[16382.87s -> 16384.70s]  OK, we're good.
[16384.70s -> 16389.13s]  We're going to be here all day.
[16389.13s -> 16390.01s]  No, we're not.
[16390.01s -> 16391.05s]  We have like another five minutes.
[16391.77s -> 16393.24s]  Holy shit.
[16393.24s -> 16394.52s]  OK, I'm screwed up.
[16401.35s -> 16402.31s]  Look at how shitty that is.
[16403.03s -> 16404.04s]  Look at that.
[16404.04s -> 16405.88s]  Do you see how weirdly that's moving?
[16405.88s -> 16406.92s]  It's like we could framey.
[16407.72s -> 16419.05s]  Oh, that sucks.
[16419.69s -> 16426.12s]  Oh, somebody's going to make me laugh.
[16426.76s -> 16428.68s]  You just made me laugh, but I have to pay attention.
[16428.68s -> 16431.48s]  I don't even want to say it out loud because it was really, really funny.
[16431.48s -> 16435.88s]  OK, I'm going to say it, but I'm going to make sure I pay attention to the game.
[16436.74s -> 16439.22s]  Somebody said this is the music from British Bake Off.
[16440.18s -> 16440.98s]  And it is.
[16443.82s -> 16444.32s]  It is.
[16445.12s -> 16456.04s]  I can't believe somebody found that.
[16458.22s -> 16464.14s]  This is a good combo.
[16464.14s -> 16464.70s]  Don't fuck it up.
[16470.28s -> 16471.96s]  600 per sword.
[16479.08s -> 16481.24s]  Oh my god, I'm stupid.
[16481.24s -> 16482.76s]  Why would I do that to myself?
[16483.40s -> 16485.00s]  There's no reason to do that.
[16485.88s -> 16487.16s]  Oh my god.
[16487.16s -> 16488.76s]  Why am I doing that to myself?
[16498.78s -> 16499.58s]  I'm sorry.
[16500.14s -> 16500.94s]  I had to.
[16501.66s -> 16507.92s]  Just a man working hard to cheat on his family.
[16507.92s -> 16514.76s]  You're doing a good job.
[16514.76s -> 16515.26s]  10 grand.
[16520.24s -> 16520.96s]  All right, don't...
[16520.96s -> 16521.36s]  I'm not...
[16521.36s -> 16521.86s]  All right.
[16522.86s -> 16523.36s]  If I...
[16524.38s -> 16525.10s]  I have to do this.
[16525.10s -> 16526.86s]  I have to say this, otherwise I won't stop.
[16527.58s -> 16534.43s]  If I don't wait for one bounce, add 50 billion dollars to the debt.
[16534.43s -> 16535.98s]  OK, that's the only...
[16535.98s -> 16537.34s]  I'm forcing myself to do that.
[16537.34s -> 16540.01s]  It has to be one bounce.
[16540.01s -> 16544.14s]  That's how you make a blade.
[16544.14s -> 16552.03s]  See, now I forced myself to do it.
[16552.83s -> 16561.71s]  It's like a devil in my brain that's like,
[16561.71s -> 16562.67s]  press it, press it now.
[16563.31s -> 16563.81s]  Nope.
[16565.71s -> 16566.43s]  I won't do it.
[16566.43s -> 16567.31s]  I'm not gonna do it.
[16567.31s -> 16579.76s]  We're good.
[16584.72s -> 16585.44s]  There we go.
[16588.56s -> 16593.37s]  It's gonna be funny if you didn't do that.
[16593.37s -> 16594.65s]  Well, it's not gonna happen.
[16596.25s -> 16600.64s]  So does this ghost know that what I did?
[16611.21s -> 16613.29s]  Your new wife is watching you right now.
[16613.29s -> 16613.79s]  Yeah.
[16614.25s -> 16621.79s]  I'll buy a house here in Bowerstone.
[16624.06s -> 16625.66s]  That blade's complete.
[16625.66s -> 16626.38s]  He's a ghost.
[16626.38s -> 16626.94s]  Who cares?
[16629.08s -> 16636.16s]  I really do like this fact that I'm forcing myself to wait.
[16636.72s -> 16638.72s]  It's very helpful.
[16639.36s -> 16642.94s]  All right.
[16642.94s -> 16645.98s]  Now I don't care if I lose, I lose, but I have 10 grand now.
[16646.54s -> 16652.02s]  OK.
[16652.02s -> 16652.52s]  Goodbye.
[16652.52s -> 16653.28s]  Don't you know how to use a hammer?
[16653.28s -> 16653.60s]  Goodbye.
[16653.60s -> 16656.11s]  I'm out.
[16656.11s -> 16657.07s]  Everybody loves me.

[16675.79s -> 16676.91s]  I'm gonna be funny.
[16676.91s -> 16680.35s]  If you were really a proper adventurer, I would have heard of you.
[16686.81s -> 16688.00s]  All right.
[16688.00s -> 16688.72s]  You think that's funny?
[16689.44s -> 16690.32s]  What else do you think is funny?
[16690.48s -> 16691.04s]  Good.
[16691.04s -> 16691.84s]  Very good.
[16692.96s -> 16693.76s]  Dancing.
[16693.76s -> 16694.24s]  It's funny.
[16696.24s -> 16700.49s]  It's because I have a bunch of money?
[16701.37s -> 16702.96s]  OK.
[16702.96s -> 16703.68s]  I want my present.
[16705.76s -> 16706.48s]  Wait.
[16706.48s -> 16707.68s]  Am I gonna put a ring on you?
[16708.48s -> 16708.72s]  Wait.
[16708.72s -> 16709.28s]  How does this work?
[16714.80s -> 16715.30s]  What?
[16721.24s -> 16724.84s]  Like I used to?
[16724.84s -> 16725.96s]  Wait.
[16725.96s -> 16726.44s]  What happened?
[16740.84s -> 16741.72s]  Give me back the ring.
[16741.72s -> 16742.52s]  Can I have the ring back?
[16750.52s -> 16751.58s]  Oh, thanks, kid.
[16759.80s -> 16759.96s]  All right.
[16759.96s -> 16760.60s]  Give me that present.
[16762.35s -> 16763.79s]  Watered down XP potion.
[16763.79s -> 16764.29s]  OK.
[16774.70s -> 16777.50s]  Am I gonna have a new wife in front of the old new wife?
[16777.58s -> 16783.02s]  So I have a wife with a kid in a different town.
[16783.02s -> 16785.42s]  I married, I engaged this person over here.
[16786.46s -> 16788.86s]  And then now I have, this is a wife now.
[16789.50s -> 16793.66s]  Are we good?
[16796.56s -> 16797.44s]  Find a good ring.
[16798.40s -> 16799.12s]  Oh, shit.

[16809.53s -> 16810.09s]  I need a ring.
[16810.73s -> 16812.81s]  Where can I buy a ring?
[16812.81s -> 16813.21s]  Somebody.
[16813.21s -> 16814.01s]  Somebody sell me a ring.
[16814.88s -> 16815.60s]  Who sells the ring?
[16818.83s -> 16820.51s]  Can I buy this meat shop?
[16821.96s -> 16822.84s]  Oh, shit.

[16829.90s -> 16831.18s]  Wait, can we, can I?
[16832.20s -> 16833.24s]  Wait, who wants to be intimate?
[16834.60s -> 16834.84s]  You?
[16835.64s -> 16836.86s]  Who the hell are you?
[16839.20s -> 16839.76s]  What?
[16839.76s -> 16840.40s]  What's going on?

[16851.21s -> 16851.93s]  Potion shop.
[16851.93s -> 16852.73s]  No, I need a house.

[16873.31s -> 16874.11s]  Get in here.
[16874.11s -> 16874.67s]  What are we doing?
[16875.23s -> 16884.83s]  Who just like wanted to like come and like have sex with me?
[16885.47s -> 16887.40s]  Is that what she was asking?
[16889.40s -> 16891.32s]  Somebody was like, oh, let's go find somewhere private.
[16891.32s -> 16891.88s]  Who was that?
[16893.72s -> 16895.16s]  Miriam the traveler.

[17247.52s -> 17249.12s]  Oh, that's the town crier.
[17252.59s -> 17255.79s]  But still, it'd be nice if yours were a bit better.

[17286.06s -> 17289.10s]  OK, where's the jeweler?

[17296.57s -> 17297.77s]  I want to buy jewelry.
[17308.96s -> 17310.72s]  I mean, I want to hit the guy with the fucking axe.
[17314.49s -> 17315.37s]  I want to hit him with an axe.
[17321.13s -> 17325.60s]  All right.

[17350.84s -> 17351.72s]  Bad and ugly.
[17351.72s -> 17353.08s]  I'm not bad and ugly.
[17355.16s -> 17361.08s]  Look at the pie stand.
[17361.88s -> 17372.52s]  What's wrong with the pie stand?
[17377.45s -> 17378.33s]  Adjust prices.
[17379.05s -> 17387.74s]  Setting the prices lower is an act of purity.
[17387.74s -> 17389.04s]  How much are they?
[17389.04s -> 17389.84s]  A pie is what?

[17449.20s -> 17449.92s]  Stop.

[17490.09s -> 17491.61s]  I'm going to buy the ring and give it to her.
[17492.89s -> 17493.37s]  Okay.

[17517.45s -> 17518.68s]  Love potion?
[17521.32s -> 17522.60s]  I'm spending all my fucking money.
[17522.60s -> 17523.56s]  I don't want to spend all my money.
[17531.37s -> 17532.65s]  Where's that kid's parents?
[17532.65s -> 17532.89s]  All right.

[17560.83s -> 17562.43s]  Let's go.
[17562.43s -> 17562.75s]  Come on.
[17563.87s -> 17569.10s]  Okay.
[17569.10s -> 17570.22s]  Now let's go home.
[17574.14s -> 17574.86s]  Hey, look at that.
[17575.50s -> 17576.30s]  Marital home.
[17587.72s -> 17588.92s]  On a sunny morning.
[17588.92s -> 17589.64s]  Under a clear sky.
[17589.64s -> 17590.60s]  What's a bigamist?
[17590.60s -> 17593.72s]  The villagers crowded together to witness two people stand.
[17593.72s -> 17596.28s]  Is that if you're married to more than one person and you have fat?
[17596.28s -> 17598.36s]  Some say they were a strange couple.
[17598.36s -> 17600.84s]  Others that they saw a story of true love.
[17600.84s -> 17608.44s]  Only time would tell.
[17608.44s -> 17609.00s]  Okay.
[17609.00s -> 17613.55s]  I just know we're going to be so happy together.
[17613.55s -> 17614.19s]  Yes, we will.
[17615.15s -> 17616.83s]  Hey, you.
[17617.55s -> 17621.36s]  You are a lovely elite.
[17621.36s -> 17622.33s]  I got a nice house.
[17622.33s -> 17622.81s]  All right.
[17622.81s -> 17624.25s]  I want to get close to you.
[17624.25s -> 17626.49s]  Yes, really close.
[17626.49s -> 17626.73s]  Yes.
[17628.65s -> 17630.64s]  Let's go upstairs.
[17639.08s -> 17639.56s]  All right.
[17641.20s -> 17641.68s]  Here we go.
[17659.64s -> 17670.72s]  How about we find a quiet place and have some fun?
[17670.72s -> 17671.52s]  What do you think I'm trying to do?
[17672.32s -> 17675.85s]  I'd never say no to you, darling.
[17676.49s -> 17685.05s]  People find me more attractive.
[17686.80s -> 17687.92s]  Wait, we didn't even do anything.
[17689.79s -> 17690.91s]  Just plus 20.
[17693.47s -> 17694.51s]  What was that?
[17694.51s -> 17695.63s]  Plus 20 disgust?
[17698.03s -> 17698.59s]  What happened?
[17700.03s -> 17701.37s]  What do you mean over there?
[17702.49s -> 17705.40s]  You're saying that I have a gross house?
[17711.64s -> 17712.76s]  Oh my god.
[17716.27s -> 17718.43s]  Your house is fucking disgusting.
[17729.32s -> 17729.80s]  Uh-oh.
[17734.52s -> 17735.40s]  Oh, a baby.
[17737.88s -> 17745.05s]  Is this kid's name?
[17751.92s -> 17752.64s]  What does this kid like?
[17757.58s -> 17759.10s]  I wanted to do more info.
[17759.10s -> 17759.98s]  Put the gun.
[17767.48s -> 17770.68s]  Exit game, exit game, exit game.
[17771.96s -> 17778.73s]  How do I get out of this?
[17779.61s -> 17780.41s]  Oh shit.
[17781.29s -> 17783.13s]  Are we all right?
[17783.77s -> 17784.57s]  No, no, no, no.
[17784.57s -> 17785.13s]  I'm sorry.
[17785.69s -> 17789.07s]  Is the baby still in there?
[17789.71s -> 17795.88s]  It likes the loot.
[17795.88s -> 17796.20s]  Okay.
[17796.92s -> 17800.83s]  Where's my loot?
[17801.55s -> 17802.19s]  I had a loot.
[17802.19s -> 17802.59s]  Where is it?
[17809.87s -> 17810.43s]  What do you want?
[17825.90s -> 17831.69s]  Are you fucking serious?
[17842.28s -> 17843.16s]  How do I do this?
[17847.48s -> 17848.76s]  Okay, come over here.
[17848.76s -> 17855.56s]  The other bed?
[17856.28s -> 17873.00s]  Why can't we do this?
[17877.48s -> 17878.76s]  Switch targets?
[17878.76s -> 17882.22s]  I just had some seafood earlier.
[17882.22s -> 17883.96s]  Tell her to follow you.
[17906.04s -> 17906.44s]  Damn it.
[17906.44s -> 17908.04s]  Did I miss the opportunity?
[17908.04s -> 17909.56s]  That would have been fucking hilarious.
[17910.20s -> 17913.80s]  You used the thumbs up on the baby.
[17916.60s -> 17917.40s]  I can still do it?
[17918.36s -> 17919.56s]  Do I have to go find a different bed?
[17926.59s -> 17927.39s]  Oh my god.
[17927.39s -> 17927.71s]  Damn it.
[17929.07s -> 17930.92s]  Do I have to flirt?
[17936.16s -> 17937.40s]  I need to hurry to leave.
[17938.28s -> 17939.08s]  I'm too tired?
[17959.98s -> 17963.10s]  It's on cooldown?
[17963.74s -> 17964.62s]  It can't be.
[17977.47s -> 17978.03s]  Damn it.
[17978.03s -> 17980.51s]  Oh, we had such a funny moment there.
[17980.51s -> 17981.31s]  Oh well.
[17981.31s -> 17982.65s]  Just keep flirting with her.
[17992.64s -> 17992.96s]  Come on.
[17999.71s -> 18000.19s]  Come on.
[18000.19s -> 18001.31s]  Well, what do you think I'm trying to do?
[18012.97s -> 18014.17s]  What are you waiting for?
[18015.21s -> 18021.02s]  He makes me go goo.
[18021.02s -> 18022.46s]  Oh my god.
[18022.46s -> 18023.66s]  No, don't.
[18046.96s -> 18048.16s]  Does she know?
[18048.16s -> 18052.68s]  Do you want to send your property gypsy caravan?
[18056.57s -> 18057.21s]  No, wait.
[18060.49s -> 18060.73s]  What?
[18060.73s -> 18061.61s]  Where are we going?
[18063.53s -> 18063.77s]  Wait.
[18069.45s -> 18072.57s]  How many people in this house looking to get fucking married?
[18073.45s -> 18076.17s]  Who's this guy?
[18076.17s -> 18077.93s]  Who is this person?
[18078.97s -> 18079.93s]  What are you doing?
[18079.93s -> 18081.29s]  Rob the house husband.
[18082.09s -> 18084.97s]  Wait, did you just get a new husband?
[18090.96s -> 18092.96s]  Who is dating who in this house?
[18093.60s -> 18094.56s]  Who are these people?
[18103.26s -> 18104.46s]  I have no idea what's going on.
[18105.02s -> 18105.82s]  All right, I gotta go.
[18106.78s -> 18110.28s]  Go back to the ghost?
[18110.28s -> 18111.16s]  Oh shit, that's right.
[18127.37s -> 18129.69s]  When she came up, she was like, oh, you want to go somewhere nice?
[18130.33s -> 18133.77s]  Oh, if I could have had actual sex with her in there.
[18134.33s -> 18144.76s]  That would have been the stupidest thing ever.
[18144.76s -> 18146.44s]  You ran away from it all?
[18146.44s -> 18148.52s]  Well, I need to go back to the ghost.
[18149.32s -> 18152.22s]  That was an actual wife's boyfriend in there.
[18152.22s -> 18153.26s]  The house husband.
[18157.45s -> 18157.77s]  What?
[18159.80s -> 18161.32s]  Why are these people following me?
[18168.57s -> 18169.29s]  Oh god.
[18170.25s -> 18171.53s]  Is this quest even tracked?
[18175.34s -> 18176.22s]  Yeah, this is tracked.
[18184.72s -> 18185.76s]  You need to kill them.
[18187.85s -> 18188.49s]  I can't.
[18191.44s -> 18192.40s]  I can't do it.
[18193.28s -> 18193.92s]  It's evil.
[18193.92s -> 18194.80s]  I can't.
[18194.80s -> 18195.36s]  What was that?
[18198.52s -> 18200.60s]  Oh shit, she's got shot.
[18201.72s -> 18203.16s]  Oh god.
[18203.16s -> 18204.36s]  No, wait, wait.
[18204.36s -> 18205.56s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[18205.56s -> 18206.28s]  Please, please, please.
[18207.00s -> 18207.32s]  Don't.
[18208.60s -> 18209.40s]  Oh no.
[18212.48s -> 18213.36s]  Get out of the way.
[18216.86s -> 18219.79s]  Oh, run.
[18219.79s -> 18220.43s]  Run away.
[18222.83s -> 18223.55s]  My god.
[18225.87s -> 18226.67s]  Get out of here.
[18227.39s -> 18229.39s]  Holy shit.
[18229.39s -> 18230.11s]  They're still alive.
[18230.11s -> 18230.83s]  They're still alive.
[18231.39s -> 18232.89s]  They're fine.
[18233.45s -> 18234.33s]  Oh my god.
[18234.33s -> 18235.05s]  That was horrible.
[18238.48s -> 18238.80s]  Okay.
[18238.80s -> 18239.44s]  Where am I going?
[18242.72s -> 18243.12s]  All right.
[18243.12s -> 18244.72s]  She got shot in the neck.
[18244.72s -> 18245.68s]  That was horrible.
[18246.32s -> 18249.95s]  All right.
[18251.39s -> 18252.03s]  No, I can't.
[18255.50s -> 18256.06s]  Where is this?
[18258.72s -> 18259.92s]  Why is it making me go this way?
[18259.92s -> 18261.36s]  Till death do us part.
[18261.36s -> 18262.80s]  I want this one tracked.
[18262.80s -> 18265.84s]  Power stone.
[18265.84s -> 18266.56s]  Isn't that where I am?
[18267.12s -> 18271.79s]  That's where I am.
[18291.13s -> 18291.85s]  Oh my god.
[18291.85s -> 18292.65s]  That's so funny.
[18298.00s -> 18298.72s]  Okay, let's go.
[18302.22s -> 18302.94s]  So much.
[18303.82s -> 18305.34s]  You think it's time you got a ring?
[18312.17s -> 18313.77s]  I'm working on it.
[18313.77s -> 18325.98s]  What?
[18350.41s -> 18350.73s]  All right.
[18350.73s -> 18352.57s]  I have to get her safely out of here.
[18353.37s -> 18354.73s]  Is that what was dead?
[18355.77s -> 18362.12s]  You all right?
[18362.12s -> 18362.68s]  Where you going?
[18362.68s -> 18363.16s]  Where you going?
[18363.16s -> 18363.48s]  Ow.
[18364.20s -> 18373.61s]  Okay.
[18373.61s -> 18379.39s]  Well, there's an interaction to tell you to stop following you.
[18379.39s -> 18384.80s]  She's dead?
[18387.00s -> 18387.96s]  Hey, well.
[18387.96s -> 18388.68s]  For your trouble.
[18389.24s -> 18390.12s]  How about a ruby?
[18391.76s -> 18392.08s]  Hold on.
[18392.08s -> 18394.24s]  We gotta bury this other lady first.
[18394.24s -> 18411.07s]  There's nothing in here.
[18411.07s -> 18411.71s]  What's wrong?
[18411.71s -> 18419.32s]  Am I not close enough?
[18419.32s -> 18419.96s]  There we go.
[18422.75s -> 18423.95s]  Instant Java potion.
[18423.95s -> 18424.27s]  Cool.
[18424.27s -> 18432.67s]  All right.
[18432.67s -> 18432.99s]  Ooh.
[18441.82s -> 18442.06s]  All right.
[18442.06s -> 18442.70s]  We're almost there.
[18449.13s -> 18449.69s]  Where are you?
[18451.52s -> 18452.56s]  Oh, god.
[18452.56s -> 18452.88s]  All right.
[18452.88s -> 18453.36s]  You know what?
[18453.36s -> 18454.40s]  You have to go.
[18454.40s -> 18454.72s]  Okay.
[18454.72s -> 18454.96s]  Wait.
[18454.96s -> 18456.08s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[18456.08s -> 18456.88s]  I said you gotta send you back.
[18456.88s -> 18457.20s]  Send you home.
[18457.20s -> 18457.68s]  Send you home.
[18458.40s -> 18460.16s]  Where are you running towards the people with the guns?
[18460.80s -> 18461.68s]  This way, please.
[18461.68s -> 18462.16s]  This way.
[18462.16s -> 18462.80s]  Excuse me.
[18463.53s -> 18463.93s]  Yep.
[18463.93s -> 18464.49s]  You're fine.
[18465.13s -> 18466.09s]  Oh, my god.
[18468.70s -> 18469.02s]  Okay.
[18469.02s -> 18469.58s]  Go home.
[18469.58s -> 18470.46s]  How do I tell you to go home?
[18471.18s -> 18479.96s]  All right.
[18479.96s -> 18480.20s]  Go.
[18480.20s -> 18481.08s]  Dismiss.
[18481.08s -> 18481.32s]  Go.
[18481.88s -> 18483.76s]  Dismiss.
[18490.33s -> 18490.81s]  Dismiss.
[18500.14s -> 18500.46s]  You're not...
[18500.46s -> 18501.10s]  Okay.
[18501.10s -> 18501.34s]  Don't...
[18502.60s -> 18505.66s]  Why are you going this way?
[18505.66s -> 18506.06s]  Okay.
[18506.06s -> 18506.62s]  Thank god.
[18507.18s -> 18510.48s]  All right.
[18510.48s -> 18511.20s]  We're good.
[18511.20s -> 18523.93s]  Let's go.
[18532.89s -> 18533.69s]  Where are you going?
[18535.71s -> 18536.19s]  Honey.
[18536.19s -> 18536.59s]  Honey.
[18536.59s -> 18537.71s]  You need to go the other way.
[18537.71s -> 18538.51s]  Oh, my god.
[18538.51s -> 18539.87s]  She's fucking so stupid.
[18541.69s -> 18542.09s]  Get.
[18542.09s -> 18542.81s]  Dismiss.
[18542.81s -> 18543.21s]  Dismiss.
[18543.21s -> 18543.69s]  Dismiss.
[18543.69s -> 18544.49s]  Dismiss.
[18544.49s -> 18544.97s]  Dismiss.
[18544.97s -> 18545.77s]  Dismiss.
[18545.77s -> 18546.01s]  Yes.
[18546.01s -> 18546.57s]  You're going...
[18546.57s -> 18547.61s]  Do you see what's happening over here?
[18549.77s -> 18550.81s]  Not a good place to run.
[18551.53s -> 18552.33s]  Don't come over here.
[18553.13s -> 18555.23s]  Okay.
[18555.23s -> 18555.47s]  Good.
[18556.11s -> 18566.03s]  Oh, shit.
[18566.59s -> 18569.61s]  Oh, my god.
[18569.61s -> 18570.33s]  Honey, I'm gonna die.
[18576.20s -> 18577.24s]  I'm gonna run this way.
[18580.01s -> 18580.57s]  New plan.
[18580.57s -> 18581.05s]  New plan.
[18581.05s -> 18581.29s]  Run.
[18581.85s -> 18607.50s]  What are you doing?
[18607.50s -> 18608.38s]  I lost the game.
[18608.38s -> 18609.50s]  I did not lose the game.
[18609.50s -> 18609.90s]  I'm fine.
[18610.54s -> 18626.89s]  What do you even do in this game?
[18629.20s -> 18630.40s]  Kind of a combination of everything.
[18634.25s -> 18634.97s]  Nice.
[18634.97s -> 18635.37s]  In the head.
[18638.30s -> 18638.62s]  Nice.
[18638.62s -> 18639.02s]  All right.
[18639.02s -> 18639.26s]  Good.
[18639.90s -> 18642.88s]  You know, I'm going back to lightning.
[18646.89s -> 18648.09s]  I think she's still following me.
[18651.50s -> 18671.07s]  Okay.
[18671.87s -> 18673.95s]  I guess you're just gonna keep following me,
[18673.95s -> 18680.11s]  so might as well let you just follow.
[18680.11s -> 18682.48s]  Here we go.
[18682.48s -> 18683.36s]  I'm back.
[18683.36s -> 18684.24s]  And I was a dick.
[18710.22s -> 18711.58s]  Treat her well, will you?
[18712.14s -> 18717.31s]  Or I'll be back to her.
[18717.31s -> 18718.03s]  Wait.
[18718.03s -> 18718.83s]  What does that part mean?
[18727.79s -> 18729.47s]  He takes a step away and comes right back.
[18729.47s -> 18729.97s]  Oh.
[18731.82s -> 18736.32s]  Well, that didn't take very long.
[18736.88s -> 18740.65s]  Beware the ghost.
[18744.41s -> 18744.73s]  All right.
[18744.73s -> 18745.93s]  That's 100 renown.
[18745.93s -> 18747.95s]  Is she still here?
[18747.95s -> 18749.31s]  If she's still here, then we can probably leave.
[18749.95s -> 18753.98s]  Are you still here?
[18757.13s -> 18757.77s]  I think she left.
[18761.96s -> 18762.52s]  Okay.
[18762.52s -> 18764.60s]  Now I have to go back to that town
[18764.60s -> 18767.56s]  and then travel with her to the other house.
[18768.36s -> 18774.94s]  She's dead?
[18774.94s -> 18775.74s]  What do you mean she died?
[18775.74s -> 18776.38s]  What are you talking about?
[18778.28s -> 18785.85s]  Where?
[18785.85s -> 18787.21s]  Probably one shooting at you.
[18796.16s -> 18796.64s]  Okay.
[18796.64s -> 18797.44s]  Well, let's go.
[18798.24s -> 18800.08s]  That is a gigantic quest marker.
[18806.25s -> 18806.89s]  The sculptor.
[18810.52s -> 18811.64s]  I want to go back to...
[18811.64s -> 18811.96s]  What is it?
[18811.96s -> 18812.44s]  Bowerstone?
[18813.08s -> 18826.59s]  The girl that died.
[18827.71s -> 18828.35s]  One of them died.
[18829.31s -> 18832.48s]  I have to get the kiss book, you're right.
[18832.48s -> 18838.60s]  I don't think they both died.
[18838.60s -> 18839.64s]  I sent one of them back, remember?
[18848.75s -> 18849.63s]  What's going on in the house?
[18851.00s -> 18852.04s]  I've been gone for a little while.
[18854.40s -> 18854.90s]  Hello?
[18857.84s -> 18861.01s]  Okay.
[18861.55s -> 18870.16s]  Where is he?
[18870.48s -> 18873.63s]  Where is he?
[18873.63s -> 18877.71s]  Where'd he go?
[18902.62s -> 18903.42s]  Put the gun down.
[18904.06s -> 18905.23s]  Hello?
[18906.11s -> 18906.91s]  What's your name?
[18906.91s -> 18908.49s]  Hello, Amy?
[18908.49s -> 18911.93s]  I thought I had a loot.
[18911.93s -> 18913.56s]  I swear to God, I had a loot.
[18933.23s -> 18933.55s]  What are you...
[18933.55s -> 18947.52s]  I mean, who am I even doing that to?
[18949.20s -> 18950.88s]  Just anyone in the area?
[18950.88s -> 18958.38s]  Am I doing it in the mirror?
[18967.56s -> 18976.40s]  All right, where's the kiss book?
[18976.48s -> 18984.56s]  Onion!
[18984.56s -> 18985.52s]  Onion!
[18985.52s -> 18986.08s]  Onion!
[18996.11s -> 18997.79s]  All right, I need to pick a new quest.
[18997.79s -> 18999.42s]  I have to go visit...
[19000.06s -> 19001.34s]  No, where's this other person?
[19001.34s -> 19001.90s]  Where's the other...
[19001.90s -> 19003.02s]  Where'd the other little girl go?
[19003.02s -> 19003.58s]  The other lady.
[19005.92s -> 19006.56s]  What?
[19006.56s -> 19017.79s]  The other person died?
[19019.28s -> 19020.88s]  Okay, well, I need to go back to my other house
[19020.88s -> 19023.28s]  and see how my other, like, family's doing.
[19023.28s -> 19027.15s]  Right?
[19027.15s -> 19030.78s]  Like, I need to see the families, too.
[19031.82s -> 19033.10s]  Alex is unhappy.
[19033.90s -> 19035.90s]  Gwyneth, your family has a gift for you.
[19056.24s -> 19057.68s]  Holy shit, you ever gonna play the game?
[19059.32s -> 19059.96s]  Oh, that's right.
[19061.10s -> 19063.10s]  I did the ghost quest.
[19063.10s -> 19063.58s]  That was...
[19063.58s -> 19065.66s]  That whole thing was the ghost story line.
[19066.22s -> 19075.77s]  All right, let's see how this family's doing.
[19078.57s -> 19079.29s]  All right, family.
[19083.29s -> 19083.85s]  Dad's back.
[19088.75s -> 19089.31s]  I'm back.
[19089.87s -> 19090.99s]  I'm here to chop wood.
[19092.35s -> 19093.15s]  Watch football.
[19097.28s -> 19098.00s]  Hello, honey!
[19106.81s -> 19107.21s]  Thank you.
[19120.96s -> 19123.04s]  Oh, it was little baby Kieran.
[19123.04s -> 19125.68s]  Right, Kieran is the baby's name.
[19125.68s -> 19134.11s]  Right.
[19134.11s -> 19135.07s]  Kiernan.
[19135.07s -> 19143.20s]  I said it wrong.
[19143.20s -> 19149.20s]  Okay, we're good.
[19149.20s -> 19150.72s]  Now let's do the quest.
[19150.72s -> 19153.84s]  The ritual.
[19153.84s -> 19157.32s]  Walk to the Abbot in Oakfield and press the Abbot by earning Renown.
[19157.32s -> 19159.05s]  How much Renown do I need?
[19159.05s -> 19160.91s]  I'll return to the Abbot.
[19160.91s -> 19178.94s]  Okay.
[19178.94s -> 19180.30s]  I'm pretty famous now.
[19180.30s -> 19182.38s]  I think you'd let me do whatever you wanted.
[19182.38s -> 19183.18s]  What was I supposed to do?
[19195.68s -> 19197.20s]  Walk with me a while.
[19197.20s -> 19208.46s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[19209.18s -> 19214.09s]  I'm sorry, you're very large.
[19241.84s -> 19242.80s]  Second monk.
[19242.80s -> 19245.44s]  I have chosen to send a protector for the first.
[19246.08s -> 19247.20s]  And that's you.
[19247.20s -> 19248.16s]  If you're interested.
[19249.52s -> 19251.92s]  The cave is just at the end of this road.
[19251.92s -> 19253.92s]  You have to talk louder when it's your waterfall, dude.
[19256.84s -> 19258.76s]  You probably passed it on your way here.
[19260.01s -> 19262.73s]  Our strongest monk will be waiting for you when you're ready.
[19267.87s -> 19268.19s]  All right.
[19268.19s -> 19268.67s]  Are you the...
[19270.11s -> 19271.07s]  Are you the monk?
[19273.00s -> 19274.76s]  Even if they do not yet realize it.
[19276.41s -> 19277.29s]  Benjamin the monk.
[19297.29s -> 19298.01s]  Easy game.
[19298.01s -> 19298.57s]  Just dance.
[19298.57s -> 19299.05s]  That's all right.
[19299.77s -> 19316.46s]  What are you...
[19316.46s -> 19318.11s]  Honey, what are you doing?
[19318.11s -> 19320.03s]  Wait, what is he doing out here?
[19320.03s -> 19321.23s]  What the fuck is going on?
[19321.23s -> 19322.35s]  Why are you out here?
[19323.07s -> 19323.39s]  What?
[19324.03s -> 19328.43s]  I'm so confused.
[19329.07s -> 19336.76s]  Who is that?
[19336.76s -> 19337.08s]  Is that...
[19344.83s -> 19350.96s]  What?
[19369.45s -> 19372.97s]  What if we kissed at the demon door?
[19379.77s -> 19384.35s]  Hey there, boy.
[19384.35s -> 19385.15s]  Hello.
[19385.15s -> 19388.65s]  Oh, you're a strong, handsome fellow, aren't you?
[19389.45s -> 19393.08s]  I feel better having you with me in that cave.
[19393.08s -> 19393.88s]  Yes, I will.
[19396.11s -> 19396.51s]  I feel...
[19396.51s -> 19397.31s]  Are we related?
[19397.87s -> 19398.59s]  I feel like...
[19398.59s -> 19399.63s]  I feel like we're related.
[19399.63s -> 19400.59s]  We, like, look alike.
[19401.47s -> 19402.35s]  We have the same face.
[19403.23s -> 19409.64s]  You solemn vow never to bash anyone's face in.
[19409.64s -> 19411.68s]  Did my father mention that?
[19412.48s -> 19413.28s]  Yeah.
[19413.28s -> 19417.13s]  Whatever fighting's to be done in there, it's all yours.
[19417.13s -> 19417.85s]  I have to do all the fighting?
[19417.85s -> 19420.49s]  We require a hero, not a pacifist monk.
[19423.20s -> 19425.68s]  We'll need her to find a reason to fight.
[19425.68s -> 19430.48s]  I don't mind telling you, I'm a bit envious.
[19431.12s -> 19436.28s]  All the excitement that I get to carry this bloody thing like some sort of new.
[19436.28s -> 19438.56s]  I mean, look at it.
[19438.56s -> 19439.52s]  It's enormous.
[19440.76s -> 19443.80s]  Golden or not, how much water does a bloody acorn need?
[19443.80s -> 19444.36s]  I love...
[19444.36s -> 19445.56s]  I love water.
[19445.56s -> 19447.00s]  I love water.
[19447.72s -> 19450.78s]  I like how, like, American English...
[19450.78s -> 19451.26s]  Water.
[19451.98s -> 19452.38s]  Water.
[19453.10s -> 19453.82s]  Water.
[19453.82s -> 19455.18s]  Does that sound nicer?
[19456.70s -> 19457.88s]  Water.
[19457.88s -> 19458.52s]  Water.
[19458.60s -> 19472.96s]  All Americans are from Boston.
[19472.96s -> 19476.30s]  Well, I said water and then I said water.
[19476.30s -> 19477.10s]  I said water.
[19490.27s -> 19491.47s]  Don't worry, I've got an axe.
[19499.77s -> 19501.13s]  How much longer am I going to scream for?
[19502.41s -> 19504.65s]  Um, what do I just do?
[19504.65s -> 19505.85s]  I just drank something for no reason.
[19508.01s -> 19514.30s]  Where's the dog?
[19514.30s -> 19514.94s]  Am I puking?
[19514.94s -> 19515.58s]  What's wrong with me?
[19523.39s -> 19560.52s]  I don't push or I'll split.
[19560.52s -> 19560.84s]  Sorry.
[19563.26s -> 19564.22s]  Violence.
[19564.22s -> 19564.70s]  Violence.
[19565.50s -> 19565.90s]  Violence.
[19589.82s -> 19590.46s]  What's that?
[19590.46s -> 19602.03s]  Uh-oh.
[19607.16s -> 19607.96s]  Stay on guard.
[19622.62s -> 19623.10s]  Open it up.
[19623.90s -> 19627.29s]  Stand on that and now I'll get in.
[19637.68s -> 19640.08s]  Fable one, fable two, fable three, three, three, fable three,
[19640.08s -> 19641.52s]  fable two, fable three, three, three.
[19642.16s -> 19648.88s]  Is Diablo 2, uh, remake out yet?
[19648.88s -> 19660.16s]  I wish.
[19660.72s -> 19668.89s]  Yeah, oh, say it again.
[19670.25s -> 19670.65s]  Water.
[19671.29s -> 19671.61s]  Water.
[19686.35s -> 19687.39s]  I-I-I get it.
[19701.16s -> 19703.32s]  Is your character portrayed by John Candy?
[19704.20s -> 19704.68s]  That's it.
[19705.48s -> 19708.84s]  I really hope they find someone else to do this next time.
[19710.12s -> 19713.16s]  Mind you, I'll be an old lady by then, so I'm probably off the hook.
[19714.68s -> 19719.40s]  You know, this is probably going to be the highlight of my life.
[19719.40s -> 19722.04s]  The day I carried a jug through a cave.
[19723.24s -> 19726.86s]  Shit, give me that.
[19726.86s -> 19727.82s]  Did you hear something?
[19729.18s -> 19731.82s]  No, probably just my imagination.
[19735.12s -> 19736.40s]  Don't talk much, do you?
[19737.28s -> 19738.16s]  You did hear something.
[19738.80s -> 19743.18s]  Right, I reckon that's all the water we're going to get from this one.
[19747.52s -> 19748.80s]  Oh, a silver key.
[19749.60s -> 19756.09s]  Oh my god, you guys, did you farted?
[19756.09s -> 19757.74s]  Did you hear that he farted?
[19771.90s -> 19773.90s]  Fuck, I didn't even test to see if the audio was synced.
[19774.70s -> 19778.06s]  I didn't even test to see if the audio was synced this entire game.
[19784.76s -> 19785.40s]  God damn it.
[19785.96s -> 19786.68s]  I need to test this.
[19787.24s -> 19789.08s]  Okay, ready?
[19789.08s -> 19795.42s]  Down, down, down.
[19795.42s -> 19796.22s]  Is it synced?
[19796.22s -> 19806.30s]  Is it major desync?
[19806.30s -> 19807.02s]  Is it close enough?
[19807.58s -> 19812.46s]  It's like one and a half seconds off, delayed by like 0.6 seconds.
[19812.46s -> 19818.12s]  Down, down, down.
[19818.12s -> 19819.08s]  Why one second?
[19819.64s -> 19826.01s]  Okay, so do you hear me first?
[19826.01s -> 19826.65s]  Do you hear the game?
[19827.93s -> 19828.81s]  What happens first?
[19828.81s -> 19834.65s]  How about this now?
[19834.65s -> 19835.45s]  How about ready?
[19835.45s -> 19838.62s]  Up, down, down.
[19839.26s -> 19863.21s]  Up, down, down.
[19863.21s -> 19868.51s]  Let's go.
[19868.51s -> 19871.71s]  Super, Superman.
[19872.43s -> 19883.80s]  Oh shit, people are giving me a ton of fucking subs.
[19883.80s -> 19885.48s]  I haven't even been paying attention, I'm sorry.
[19885.48s -> 19892.57s]  Oh no, somebody said it.
[19892.57s -> 19893.21s]  I have to say it now.
[19894.01s -> 19894.51s]  Ah.
[19894.97s -> 19895.61s]  Okay, I'll do it.
[19896.64s -> 19897.20s]  Gabi J!
[19898.40s -> 19898.90s]  Yay!
[19899.44s -> 19905.39s]  I just ate a bunch of fucking rotten pies.
[19919.52s -> 19923.34s]  It was like, I like this game, but it's kind of really fucking annoying.
[19924.22s -> 19927.26s]  That, like it might look like very simple on the screen,
[19927.26s -> 19931.26s]  but every time to do a spell I have to go up, up, up, up, up, down, down, down, down, down.
[19931.26s -> 19934.38s]  Hey, it's like Mortal Kombat, it's fucking so annoying.
[19935.02s -> 19948.08s]  Spells in this game suck.
[19948.08s -> 19950.96s]  Why'd you tell me that 71% of you told me to be a magician?
[19968.80s -> 19969.44s]  Behind you!
[19971.36s -> 19971.86s]  Wait, what?
[19981.87s -> 19985.60s]  I think the gifted subs.
[19986.72s -> 19987.92s]  Thank you, thank you.
[19990.88s -> 19991.20s]  Thank you.
[19994.84s -> 19995.24s]  Thank you.
[19999.40s -> 20001.08s]  Thank you, Val.
[20001.08s -> 20001.64s]  I appreciate it.
[20009.88s -> 20010.60s]  Thank you, Val.
[20011.61s -> 20013.93s]  Thank you, Balsin, for the 20 community subs.
[20016.94s -> 20026.40s]  Thank you, Chef Lazarus, for the 10 subs.
[20027.60s -> 20029.60s]  You unite your workplace, thanks for 20 community subs.
[20030.40s -> 20030.90s]  Thanks a lot, guys.
[20034.59s -> 20035.31s]  It's not their name.
[20036.51s -> 20039.88s]  Their name is Balsin.
[20040.44s -> 20045.13s]  I'm gonna stand up here and use my fucking magical tune.
[20059.64s -> 20062.44s]  Oh, the bard who plays magical tune.
[20062.44s -> 20073.05s]  I don't know, I kind of feel like Connect Dad right now, I'm not gonna lie.
[20099.79s -> 20103.26s]  Easy, game's easy.
[20103.26s -> 20127.56s]  Get the blade spell, maybe next time.
[20127.56s -> 20137.61s]  Oh, let me come down there and help you.
[20137.61s -> 20148.06s]  Are they gonna kill her?
[20148.06s -> 20153.90s]  How do you miss point blank?
[20156.40s -> 20160.00s]  I can turn safety off and kill her?
[20160.00s -> 20164.16s]  What?
[20164.16s -> 20164.64s]  Toughness.
[20166.32s -> 20171.69s]  Hold on, they get a shock three.
[20175.39s -> 20176.43s]  Blades.
[20176.43s -> 20179.37s]  Let's do blades.
[20180.11s -> 20188.72s]  Blades one and blades two.
[20188.72s -> 20198.00s]  And let's also do speed.
[20198.00s -> 20202.52s]  Blades are broken.
[20203.32s -> 20205.93s]  Oh, nice.
[20207.58s -> 20209.26s]  Low level spells are now more powerful.
[20209.98s -> 20211.77s]  All right, what do we got here?
[20211.77s -> 20214.11s]  Let's do blades two.
[20220.28s -> 20221.08s]  Oh, shit, okay.
[20221.72s -> 20225.76s]  Holy shit, that's cool.
[20225.76s -> 20226.72s]  All right, so should I keep...
[20227.44s -> 20233.23s]  All right, here's what we're gonna do.
[20233.23s -> 20234.35s]  Oh, that's awesome.
[20235.07s -> 20238.54s]  All right, blades one and vortex two.
[20238.54s -> 20240.06s]  So I'll vortex two everybody.
[20240.86s -> 20242.62s]  And then we'll drop fucking blades everywhere.
[20259.42s -> 20260.94s]  Yes, I'm always ready.
[20261.58s -> 20270.32s]  Turn safety off.
[20270.32s -> 20275.92s]  Uh-oh.
[20282.09s -> 20283.29s]  Just unlearn chaos.
[20285.77s -> 20288.65s]  Chaos three or chaos five is probably really good.
[20288.65s -> 20293.95s]  He's back.
[20293.95s -> 20295.36s]  Here he comes.
[20299.34s -> 20300.78s]  Dina, what'd you find?
[20300.78s -> 20302.46s]  Oh, God.
[20321.24s -> 20324.38s]  Horse pose is cheap and OP.
[20326.78s -> 20327.79s]  I'll check it out.
[20335.07s -> 20336.46s]  I have her boss, right?
[20350.25s -> 20355.79s]  Yeah, this is awesome.
[20356.43s -> 20357.47s]  Why did I not just...
[20357.47s -> 20359.23s]  Okay, why would I ever use another move?
[20359.95s -> 20362.62s]  Why would I ever use another move?
[20363.26s -> 20373.55s]  Bro, I've been trying to tell you.
[20373.55s -> 20375.07s]  Yeah, I know, but still.
[20375.79s -> 20378.88s]  I need to level up like strength.
[20379.44s -> 20380.56s]  We have to get strength up.
[20381.12s -> 20386.46s]  Does any more health?
[20386.46s -> 20398.25s]  This health bar is so awful.
[20398.25s -> 20399.05s]  Sick.
[20399.05s -> 20407.77s]  Okay, I played Fable three or maybe like an hour or two, three hours or so.
[20407.77s -> 20409.45s]  And I thought it was absolute dog shit.
[20410.33s -> 20413.61s]  Am I misremembering this or did I just get bored of the franchise or something?
[20413.61s -> 20414.65s]  I remember not being good.
[20414.65s -> 20415.29s]  Should I play it?
[20422.78s -> 20424.38s]  No, it does suck.
[20424.38s -> 20428.78s]  Headless Hollow Man.
[20428.78s -> 20431.63s]  You have enough experience to buy something.
[20431.63s -> 20433.63s]  Okay, well, why is this so hard?
[20434.67s -> 20438.28s]  He's like the easiest enemy in the whole game.
[20438.28s -> 20439.00s]  Why is this like...
[20439.00s -> 20440.04s]  Why does he have his own cut scene?
[20441.24s -> 20443.16s]  The guy can't even see us.
[20443.16s -> 20465.66s]  That was a boss?
[20465.66s -> 20471.85s]  He was the worst one, but it was still...
[20471.85s -> 20472.49s]  I still liked it.
[20478.06s -> 20485.23s]  Fable three is still worth playing.
[20486.03s -> 20487.95s]  Yeah, I just didn't...
[20487.95s -> 20490.27s]  They added like a follower system or something, right?
[20490.27s -> 20493.95s]  Where you could open chests if you had a thousand followers,
[20493.95s -> 20496.59s]  2,000 followers, 10,000 followers, something weird like that.
[20498.35s -> 20498.91s]  No, it isn't.
[20499.63s -> 20500.19s]  What am I...
[20500.19s -> 20500.99s]  I'm...
[20500.99s -> 20501.63s]  That happens.
[20512.68s -> 20513.88s]  That's the level system.
[20530.48s -> 20534.72s]  The monks are evil.
[20544.38s -> 20545.72s]  I got one too.
[20545.72s -> 20546.12s]  Let's go.
[20549.95s -> 20551.39s]  I wish I could run faster.
[20561.60s -> 20564.56s]  Thank you, Balsin again for the 20 community subs this time.
[20564.56s -> 20565.60s]  Thank you, Balsin.
[20565.60s -> 20584.70s]  Fable one is the only one that's worth playing.
[20586.06s -> 20587.02s]  I think this one's good.
[20589.31s -> 20592.75s]  This is a good game, but if you played this when it came out...
[20595.76s -> 20598.08s]  This game promised so many things.
[20598.96s -> 20603.92s]  I remember looking at developer commentaries and hype videos about this game.
[20603.92s -> 20608.32s]  Everyone thought this was going to be like the world's greatest video game.
[20612.56s -> 20617.20s]  There was going to be like an entire living, breathing earth in this game.
[20617.92s -> 20622.70s]  And it ended up being like a 12 and a half to like 14 hour action game
[20623.26s -> 20624.94s]  that had like a marriage system.
[20627.13s -> 20629.13s]  It was not that big of a deal.
[20629.13s -> 20631.21s]  I remember watching a video of like...
[20631.21s -> 20632.01s]  Holy shit dog.
[20632.01s -> 20635.05s]  I remember watching videos of like Peter Molyneux talking about
[20635.85s -> 20640.97s]  if you plant this tree here, it will grow and you could have a forest.
[20641.77s -> 20646.65s]  And I think there's one cutscene that happens in the course of this entire like 15 hour experience
[20646.65s -> 20649.13s]  where like trees grow in a cutscene.
[20649.77s -> 20655.64s]  And that's it.
[20655.64s -> 20659.87s]  That was Fable one.
[20659.87s -> 20662.19s]  No, it was definitely Fable two because Fable one was good,
[20662.19s -> 20666.70s]  but he didn't have time to really hype it up like he did.
[20673.87s -> 20674.67s]  Wait, who's talking?
[20679.82s -> 20681.66s]  Why I'm missing important shit.
[20681.66s -> 20682.54s]  Where is this person?
[20683.82s -> 20684.70s]  Oh, God damn it.
[20684.70s -> 20685.74s]  I missed an entire thing.
[20685.74s -> 20686.38s]  Where are they?
[20700.89s -> 20702.09s]  He hyped it up the same way.
[20703.72s -> 20706.52s]  Yeah, but I remember thinking Fable two was going to be the world's...
[20720.38s -> 20721.26s]  I missed that too.
[20721.26s -> 20722.70s]  World's worst cameraman.
[20722.70s -> 20723.42s]  Oh my God.
[20757.85s -> 20758.81s]  I'm sorry, father.
[20760.41s -> 20761.53s]  Not that I broke my vow.
[20762.57s -> 20764.33s]  I'm sorry I didn't break it sooner.
[20764.33s -> 20764.83s]  What is this?
[20765.45s -> 20766.97s]  I never did fit in at this place.
[20767.85s -> 20768.81s]  We both knew that.
[20769.90s -> 20771.50s]  And now I'm making a new vow.
[20772.38s -> 20774.46s]  Lucian would die for what he did to you.
[20775.63s -> 20777.31s]  I won't break this one.
[20777.31s -> 20781.23s]  Why am I doing like the you put another t-shirt on in The Sims character creator?
[20784.99s -> 20789.08s]  As new life rises, so shall we.
[20790.14s -> 20795.28s]  As the seed returns to the earth, so do we all.
[20795.28s -> 20796.56s]  No, don't step on it.
[20796.56s -> 20797.76s]  I'm trying to move.
[20797.76s -> 20799.28s]  Okay, there's like an invisible wall right here
[20799.28s -> 20800.96s]  and it just fucked me up and I walked on it.
[20800.96s -> 20801.84s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[20801.84s -> 20802.72s]  I swear to God.
[20802.72s -> 20805.21s]  There's an invisible wall right here
[20805.21s -> 20808.17s]  and it like blocked me and fucked me up and I walked over here.
[20809.61s -> 20810.99s]  There's an invisible wall.
[20810.99s -> 20812.11s]  Look, I'm proving it right now.
[20812.11s -> 20843.15s]  I can't.
[20843.15s -> 20843.87s]  There's no farting.
[20843.87s -> 20844.43s]  I can't do anything.
[20850.57s -> 20851.61s]  I was in Renan.
[20851.61s -> 20852.25s]  Holy shit.
[20863.29s -> 20865.53s]  Cool.
[20874.84s -> 20875.64s]  I'm not going to fart.
[20875.64s -> 20877.48s]  That's no, I have to.
[20877.48s -> 20878.36s]  I'm not doing that.
[20878.36s -> 20879.08s]  That's not nice.
[20879.80s -> 20881.08s]  That's not a good boy move.
[20891.93s -> 20895.60s]  You know, so this game was cool.
[20896.64s -> 20897.60s]  I think Dark Souls.
[20899.44s -> 20902.24s]  Games like Dark, especially just when Dark Souls came out.
[20902.24s -> 20905.68s]  That like changed everything about how like an action adventure
[20905.68s -> 20908.56s]  melee kind of spell game was played.
[20909.68s -> 20911.92s]  Man, would I love a game that has this kind of
[20912.88s -> 20921.68s]  able to like world and systems, but Dark Souls level of game kind of mechanics.
[20926.41s -> 20929.93s]  Imagine a game that has like the world with all these like different like
[20930.57s -> 20932.99s]  permanently being able to kill people and
[20933.71s -> 20936.67s]  the quests and stuff, but it's like Dark Souls.
[20940.32s -> 20942.48s]  I would love like a fable slash Dark Souls.
[20943.28s -> 20943.84s]  I would love it.
[20944.40s -> 20951.60s]  Isn't this my house?
[20952.91s -> 20953.63s]  Holy shit.
[20953.63s -> 20954.43s]  I'm so sorry.
[20954.43s -> 20955.23s]  Oh my God.
[20964.80s -> 20965.92s]  I got to get out of town quick.
[20969.93s -> 20970.49s]  Wait, hold on.
[20970.49s -> 20971.21s]  What's?
[20971.21s -> 20974.22s]  Oh, they're out while they're out while they're out.
[20974.22s -> 20977.66s]  Just steal everything quick.
[20977.66s -> 20978.22s]  No, get out.
[20978.22s -> 20979.02s]  Just get out.
[20979.02s -> 20980.70s]  No, they might have something under the bed.
[20980.70s -> 20985.36s]  I can buy the house.
[20985.36s -> 20985.92s]  I can buy the house.
[20985.92s -> 20988.24s]  I can buy the house first and then it's not illegal.
[20988.24s -> 21014.03s]  How much is this place?
[21014.03s -> 21015.15s]  Holy shit.
[21015.15s -> 21022.54s]  Macho.
[21023.32s -> 21023.96s]  Are you okay?
[21032.46s -> 21033.74s]  Swim to Mexico.
[21034.54s -> 21035.16s]  All right.
[21035.16s -> 21035.56s]  I'm good.
[21036.12s -> 21041.69s]  They're like bees.
[21041.69s -> 21043.13s]  They're not going to come in the water.
[21043.13s -> 21052.56s]  Oh, what are you going to do?
[21052.56s -> 21056.19s]  What are you going to do about it?
[21056.19s -> 21056.83s]  Oh, no.
[21056.83s -> 21057.47s]  What happened?
[21058.40s -> 21059.92s]  You can't come and get me in the water.
[21068.91s -> 21103.77s]  Is the dog going to bite him?
[21103.77s -> 21108.03s]  He's like, should I?
[21108.03s -> 21108.51s]  What should I do?
[21108.51s -> 21109.15s]  Should I bite him?
[21115.85s -> 21116.17s]  All right.
[21116.17s -> 21117.58s]  Bite him.
[21117.58s -> 21118.30s]  Bite that guy.
[21119.66s -> 21120.38s]  Bite that guy.
[21120.38s -> 21122.24s]  Bite him.
[21122.24s -> 21122.80s]  Bite him.
[21122.80s -> 21124.78s]  Bite him on the leg.
[21124.78s -> 21126.14s]  Bite that guy.
[21126.14s -> 21127.18s]  Bite him.
[21127.18s -> 21140.64s]  I wonder if I can get him to go in the water.
[21141.28s -> 21144.03s]  Will he drown if he goes in the water?
[21164.73s -> 21164.97s]  All right.
[21164.97s -> 21165.69s]  I'm going to try something.
[21168.68s -> 21169.64s]  They're running in circle.
[21169.64s -> 21173.21s]  Oh, all right.
[21173.21s -> 21173.77s]  All right.
[21173.77s -> 21174.33s]  I got to go.
[21174.33s -> 21174.73s]  Fuck it.
[21178.19s -> 21190.88s]  Where the fuck am I going?
[21191.61s -> 21192.33s]  Oh, shit.
[21192.33s -> 21193.37s]  Why am I going this way?
[21194.33s -> 21195.05s]  Oh, shit.
[21195.05s -> 21195.37s]  Oh, my God.
[21195.37s -> 21195.69s]  Oh, my God.
[21195.69s -> 21196.01s]  Oh, my God.
[21196.01s -> 21196.89s]  Oh, my God.
[21196.89s -> 21197.21s]  Oh, my God.
[21197.21s -> 21197.61s]  Oh, my God.
[21197.61s -> 21198.01s]  Oh, my God.
[21198.01s -> 21199.69s]  Oh, my God.
[21199.69s -> 21200.25s]  I just shot him.
[21200.25s -> 21200.81s]  I shot a guy.
[21201.37s -> 21202.01s]  What happened?
[21209.92s -> 21213.00s]  What happened?
[21213.00s -> 21213.64s]  Wait, what?
[21213.64s -> 21220.59s]  What just happened?
[21226.06s -> 21227.66s]  It was 200 gold?
[21228.22s -> 21242.57s]  Oh, all right.
[21242.57s -> 21243.37s]  I got to relax.
[21248.36s -> 21256.00s]  Relax.
[21256.00s -> 21256.40s]  Relax.
[21256.40s -> 21258.80s]  I don't want to get into like a fucking coughing fit here.
[21263.68s -> 21272.68s]  Imagine shooting somebody in the fucking chest twice.
[21272.68s -> 21273.80s]  And the guy turns around.
[21273.80s -> 21276.68s]  He's just like, well, you can pay me $250.
[21280.67s -> 21282.19s]  That's so fucking funny.
[21283.64s -> 21287.23s]  I can't kill him.
[21288.57s -> 21289.29s]  Settle down.
[21289.29s -> 21290.33s]  Settle down.
[21290.33s -> 21291.47s]  I'm going to settle down.
[21291.47s -> 21292.51s]  That was that was...
[21292.51s -> 21295.71s]  I could have started to overthink that and laugh about that.
[21295.71s -> 21296.51s]  I got to relax.
[21302.30s -> 21306.83s]  Very well.
[21306.83s -> 21309.23s]  You've paid your debt to society.
[21309.23s -> 21313.92s]  Now then, you better not be planning on using that weapon.
[21313.92s -> 21317.63s]  I don't even think I can kill anyone again.
[21317.63s -> 21318.91s]  I want to put this weapon away.
[21318.91s -> 21320.03s]  It's closing time.
[21320.03s -> 21322.17s]  Is he about to limp?
[21323.84s -> 21324.56s]  What the fuck?
[21324.56s -> 21324.88s]  Hey!
[21325.60s -> 21327.53s]  What's he doing?
[21348.28s -> 21349.80s]  Who did he shoot the gun at?
[21349.80s -> 21354.11s]  What's going on over here?
[21354.11s -> 21355.23s]  What the hell is happening?
[21356.03s -> 21359.02s]  Wait.
[21359.02s -> 21360.46s]  Oh, they were bandits.
[21361.02s -> 21362.86s]  Oh, they were bandits attacking.
[21370.72s -> 21372.24s]  Wait, why is this happening?
[21373.39s -> 21375.07s]  Why are there so many people?
[21379.45s -> 21380.57s]  What's happening?
[21380.57s -> 21381.93s]  I don't understand.
[21381.93s -> 21382.57s]  Oh, shit.
[21383.69s -> 21389.42s]  It's like a fucking brawl.
[21391.21s -> 21391.77s]  Who's dog?
[21391.77s -> 21392.65s]  Oh, that's my dog.
[21401.53s -> 21402.81s]  This is just the purge.
[21414.59s -> 21414.99s]  All right.
[21414.99s -> 21415.55s]  I'm done.
[21415.55s -> 21416.27s]  I'm done after this.
[21416.27s -> 21417.39s]  I'm getting out of here.
[21417.39s -> 21426.46s]  Okay.
[21428.48s -> 21429.60s]  Safety on.
[21429.60s -> 21435.60s]  I mean, the guy like literally was like,
[21435.60s -> 21437.52s]  ah, thanks for paying the fee, bastard.
[21437.52s -> 21440.24s]  And then he aimed the gun and just started firing at somebody.
[21445.84s -> 21446.88s]  Oh, shit.
[21458.43s -> 21459.23s]  He's a guard.
[21459.23s -> 21459.95s]  I don't know.
[21459.95s -> 21461.39s]  I thought he was like shooting at my dog.
[21461.39s -> 21461.71s]  I don't know.
[21461.71s -> 21464.75s]  I thought he was firing at somebody that I was connected to somehow
[21464.75s -> 21466.84s]  because he was like still aggro to me.
[21466.84s -> 21469.48s]  I thought he was still aggro to my character somehow
[21470.04s -> 21471.80s]  and like was shooting at the dog.
[21471.80s -> 21472.60s]  I don't know.
[21472.60s -> 21473.68s]  Okay.
[21473.68s -> 21474.08s]  We're good.
[21474.72s -> 21488.14s]  Still, I still think that's so funny.
[21488.78s -> 21491.66s]  Two like fucking slugs in the chest and he's just like,
[21491.66s -> 21494.38s]  I'll take 250 if you just want to keep walking.
[21494.38s -> 21496.86s]  That's got like 12 holes in his body.
[21496.86s -> 21514.57s]  How do I get out of here?
[21514.57s -> 21515.45s]  I'm sorry, your honor.
[21515.45s -> 21517.13s]  I thought he was still aggroed on me.
[21518.01s -> 21532.73s]  Your spouse is threatening divorce?
[21532.73s -> 21536.70s]  Where do you see that?
[21544.60s -> 21545.08s]  Keep walking.
[21547.80s -> 21548.52s]  Keep walking.
[21548.52s -> 21549.88s]  My reputation is already awful.
[21551.36s -> 21554.80s]  What's wrong?
[21554.80s -> 21556.76s]  What's going on?
[21570.56s -> 21571.76s]  I got a gift.
[21572.32s -> 21577.52s]  Pretty necklace.
[21578.16s -> 21586.30s]  We're fine.
[21586.86s -> 21590.84s]  And I'm going to do your favorite thing.
[21591.80s -> 21592.52s]  The fist pump.
[21594.24s -> 21595.60s]  Oh shit, that's wrong.
[21595.60s -> 21596.80s]  Wrong wife.
[21596.80s -> 21598.22s]  But I think you'll still like it.
[21598.78s -> 21606.73s]  Isn't this your daughter?
[21606.73s -> 21607.05s]  What?
[21607.05s -> 21607.45s]  No.
[21607.45s -> 21608.33s]  What are you talking about?
[21608.33s -> 21608.49s]  What?
[21614.08s -> 21614.56s]  No, it's not.
[21615.20s -> 21624.89s]  All right.
[21624.89s -> 21625.37s]  Sure.
[21625.37s -> 21626.25s]  How's the baby?
[21626.81s -> 21634.68s]  Okay.
[21634.68s -> 21635.24s]  Everything's fine.
[21640.36s -> 21641.08s]  Everything's fine.
[21641.08s -> 21641.48s]  We're good.
[21654.73s -> 21656.67s]  What do you want?
[21658.41s -> 21658.65s]  Okay.
[21658.65s -> 21658.97s]  We're good.
[21661.29s -> 21662.09s]  Let me check on the baby.
[21662.09s -> 21663.29s]  How's the baby doing?
[21663.29s -> 21673.69s]  Hello.
[21673.69s -> 21674.25s]  It's me.
[21674.25s -> 21676.52s]  Hello, Amy.
[21676.52s -> 21676.92s]  Okay.
[21676.92s -> 21677.72s]  You like the loot.
[21677.72s -> 21679.32s]  Let's play some loot for you.
[21679.32s -> 21691.63s]  Oh, plus 22.
[21691.63s -> 21693.44s]  I really like that.
[21693.44s -> 21694.00s]  Let's do it again.
[21694.64s -> 21704.64s]  Okay.
[21704.64s -> 21705.20s]  See?
[21705.20s -> 21707.50s]  I have a good reputation with the baby.
[21707.50s -> 21708.54s]  With the wife.
[21708.54s -> 21711.04s]  I'm going to sleep for six hours.
[21711.04s -> 21711.68s]  Get some health.
[21712.24s -> 21719.53s]  Feel much better.
[21731.74s -> 21732.06s]  Okay.
[21733.10s -> 21734.38s]  Yeah, I can check on my business.
[21734.38s -> 21742.20s]  How's the business doing?
[21742.20s -> 21745.66s]  I have made $29.
[21745.66s -> 21750.80s]  That's awful.
[21750.80s -> 21755.96s]  Check the sculpture.
[21756.52s -> 21769.85s]  Where's the sculpture?
[21769.85s -> 21770.65s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[21770.65s -> 21771.93s]  This is Alchemist.
[21771.93s -> 21772.97s]  What would you like?
[21772.97s -> 21777.61s]  My turn.
[21777.61s -> 21781.26s]  For anything in particular.
[21781.26s -> 21781.58s]  All right.
[21781.58s -> 21781.82s]  Stay there.
[21781.82s -> 21782.78s]  I need some health potions.
[21783.90s -> 21784.94s]  Come back any time.
[21784.94s -> 21786.38s]  You're all hob strength.
[21786.38s -> 21787.34s]  Let's just buy a bunch of these.
[21787.34s -> 21788.30s]  There you go.
[21788.30s -> 21789.66s]  Skill potions.
[21789.66s -> 21790.62s]  Will potions.
[21790.62s -> 21791.26s]  Yeah, I'm going to drink.
[21791.26s -> 21792.54s]  I'm going to just cheat.
[21792.54s -> 21798.01s]  One of my nephews will.
[21798.01s -> 21801.80s]  Okay.
[21801.80s -> 21802.36s]  Potions.
[21803.24s -> 21804.84s]  I want a will potion.
[21806.99s -> 21807.47s]  Excellent.
[21810.04s -> 21811.32s]  Drink all the potions.
[21811.32s -> 21812.12s]  Steal the money back.
[21812.12s -> 21812.52s]  I can't.
[21813.16s -> 21815.21s]  Skill potion.
[21815.21s -> 21816.81s]  Your wife looks ever happy.
[21816.81s -> 21817.68s]  Nice.
[21823.12s -> 21823.44s]  Strength.
[21823.44s -> 21825.52s]  I have three strength potions.
[21825.52s -> 21825.84s]  Whatever.
[21825.84s -> 21826.80s]  You know the word I'm trying to say.
[21828.16s -> 21833.24s]  Oh, my God.
[21834.92s -> 21837.28s]  Well, I'll be able to upgrade a ton of stuff in strength.
[21843.18s -> 21844.44s]  What time is it?
[21844.44s -> 21845.16s]  It's been six hours.
[21846.75s -> 21847.55s]  We'll probably stop soon.
[21851.39s -> 21853.23s]  I'm probably not going to beat the game tomorrow,
[21853.23s -> 21854.19s]  but you know, we'll see.
[21860.70s -> 21863.37s]  I didn't take a piss one time.
[21863.37s -> 21863.77s]  No, you're right.
[21863.77s -> 21867.77s]  I didn't.
[21867.77s -> 21869.13s]  You most certainly will not.
[21869.13s -> 21870.81s]  No, I probably will not.
[21871.53s -> 21873.37s]  But we'll still play at a bunch.
[21874.09s -> 21877.28s]  Okay.
[21877.28s -> 21878.48s]  Let me, I can level up.
[21878.48s -> 21883.84s]  Okay.
[21883.84s -> 21886.99s]  I've got four, like 5,000.
[21886.99s -> 21889.71s]  How much is blades?
[21889.71s -> 21891.20s]  Three.
[21891.20s -> 21891.44s]  All right.
[21891.44s -> 21892.72s]  I'm saving up for blades three.
[21892.72s -> 21896.89s]  It's too good.
[21896.89s -> 21899.71s]  But I can do, I need to level up this.
[21899.71s -> 21900.67s]  It's awful.
[21900.67s -> 21908.01s]  Flourishes.
[21908.01s -> 21909.69s]  Flourishes are really, really cool, actually.
[21909.69s -> 21910.41s]  From what I remember.
[21913.42s -> 21914.14s]  Save the game.
[21916.62s -> 21917.74s]  Oh, my God.
[21918.38s -> 21924.25s]  Have I not done that the whole game?
[21925.64s -> 21926.60s]  Sell chaos back.
[21926.60s -> 21926.76s]  Yeah.
[21927.48s -> 21935.79s]  Can I do that?
[21938.36s -> 21939.56s]  I don't think I can sell this back.
[21946.38s -> 21947.66s]  I'm just going to scare this guy.
[21950.88s -> 21951.60s]  I just feel like it.
[21966.67s -> 21967.31s]  Reach over.
[21968.11s -> 21969.63s]  Pull money out of the register.
[21969.63s -> 21971.16s]  Oh, press Y.
[21977.34s -> 21977.74s]  Wait, what?
[21977.74s -> 21979.74s]  I hear like the, why do I hear those bells?
[21979.74s -> 21979.98s]  All right.
[21979.98s -> 21981.50s]  Let's do some blacksmithing.
[21981.50s -> 21982.46s]  Everyone's going to be pissed.
[21982.46s -> 21982.94s]  I know.
[21982.94s -> 21984.38s]  Whatever.
[21984.38s -> 21985.50s]  Everybody hates this shit.
[21985.50s -> 21986.46s]  Nobody wants to watch this.
[21986.46s -> 21986.70s]  I know.
[21986.70s -> 21987.18s]  But whatever.
[21987.66s -> 21999.76s]  I don't think I didn't remember.
[22004.51s -> 22005.45s]  Oh, yeah.
[22005.45s -> 22006.49s]  We'll play this again tomorrow.
[22006.49s -> 22010.65s]  I'm not going to start at like four o'clock like today.
[22010.65s -> 22012.46s]  It was just a bunch of stuff I had to do today.
[22013.66s -> 22016.59s]  Before we start around two o'clock Pacific.
[22017.63s -> 22019.39s]  Yeah, that sounds good to me.
[22019.39s -> 22027.79s]  This is a lot of fun, though.
[22027.79s -> 22031.31s]  It's fun just, I mean, I don't feel like I haven't really done very much,
[22031.31s -> 22033.15s]  but I've enjoyed the whole time I've been playing.
[22040.75s -> 22042.27s]  We'll do more missions tomorrow.
[22046.03s -> 22047.63s]  We'll do some more story stuff tomorrow.
[22047.63s -> 22049.47s]  I spent the whole time just fucking around.
[22049.47s -> 22054.97s]  It was very fun.
[22055.53s -> 22058.08s]  I'm a good boy, too.
[22067.98s -> 22069.10s]  Yeah, I only got one hero.
[22069.10s -> 22070.06s]  I need two more heroes.
[22071.26s -> 22074.78s]  And look, if I don't beat it tomorrow, you know, it's all good.
[22075.90s -> 22077.26s]  I don't need to beat Fable, too.
[22078.99s -> 22084.12s]  We'll play it for like another six, seven hours tomorrow and see where we are.
[22095.39s -> 22098.11s]  Yeah, you know, everyone knows it's coming.
[22098.11s -> 22099.39s]  End of the stream voice is right.
[22101.87s -> 22103.39s]  Yeah, Hassan raided the stream.
[22104.27s -> 22108.03s]  If any of you are still here, thanks for checking out the stream.
[22114.68s -> 22118.06s]  And again, I will reiterate this next Sunday.
[22119.34s -> 22120.86s]  Is it going to be something very interesting?
[22121.88s -> 22123.08s]  I don't know exactly what it is,
[22123.08s -> 22126.04s]  but I've been told it's going to be a nice, really, really great time.
[22126.92s -> 22128.04s]  I don't really know what that means.
[22134.32s -> 22144.89s]  He's going to play Among Us next Sunday.
[22144.89s -> 22145.61s]  Oh, God, no.
[22149.85s -> 22152.25s]  He said he's going to raid the guy who never streams and it was you.
[22152.89s -> 22157.76s]  I mean, I stream once.
[22157.76s -> 22159.28s]  I stream like once or twice a week.
[22164.06s -> 22165.90s]  Raid the guy who never streams.
[22172.03s -> 22178.01s]  Now, I told you the only way I would play Among Us
[22180.91s -> 22184.03s]  is if I did an Impostor is Sus guy plays Among Us
[22184.67s -> 22187.71s]  and tried to get like a hundred thousand community subs
[22189.88s -> 22193.56s]  and just do like a massive sellout like I'm the Impostor is Sus guy.
[22193.56s -> 22194.92s]  Like, look at how cool this is.
[22194.92s -> 22195.96s]  I'm playing Among Us.
[22195.96s -> 22198.64s]  But the reason why I never decided to do it
[22199.50s -> 22202.56s]  was because that means that all those people stay
[22202.56s -> 22205.04s]  and it will never go away.
[22205.04s -> 22206.08s]  You know how many people,
[22206.08s -> 22208.48s]  if I were to do an Impostor is Sus guy stream,
[22209.63s -> 22211.47s]  they would show up and they would be like,
[22211.47s -> 22213.47s]  Impostor is Sus guy that they would never leave.
[22214.03s -> 22216.35s]  And it's the only thing I would be asked to do for the rest of my life.
[22225.92s -> 22226.96s]  What about the numbers?
[22227.96s -> 22230.52s]  Yeah, some things just aren't worth that much money.
[22230.52s -> 22231.08s]  You know what I mean?
[22231.08s -> 22233.16s]  Some things are really just not worth it to me.
[22234.19s -> 22234.91s]  That's one of them.
[22236.73s -> 22237.69s]  I don't really care.
[22238.17s -> 22241.37s]  I don't want like a fucking hundred thousand
[22241.37s -> 22243.21s]  Impostor is Sus community subs.
[22256.41s -> 22257.45s]  It would be wicked cool.
[22259.12s -> 22261.60s]  This is a thousand bucks for every single one of these I'm doing.
[22262.16s -> 22263.20s]  I haven't missed once.
[22273.60s -> 22274.32s]  Think of the debt.
[22274.32s -> 22274.96s]  No, I'm not.
[22274.96s -> 22275.76s]  I would never do it.
[22276.56s -> 22284.35s]  That's integrity.
[22286.51s -> 22287.39s]  I don't think so.
[22287.39s -> 22289.71s]  I think I just don't want to have to look in my Discord
[22289.71s -> 22292.94s]  and see 500 messages a day saying,
[22293.02s -> 22294.86s]  Is he going to do another Among Us stream?
[22294.86s -> 22296.54s]  When's the Sus guy going to do it again?
[22297.02s -> 22298.14s]  Where's Sus guy?
[22298.14s -> 22298.54s]  Where is he?
[22298.54s -> 22299.74s]  That stream was so good.
[22299.74s -> 22300.30s]  Do it again.
[22300.30s -> 22301.90s]  Why is he not doing it tomorrow?
[22301.90s -> 22302.54s]  Do it now.
[22303.42s -> 22306.04s]  Every stream.
[22306.04s -> 22307.24s]  Where's Among Us?
[22307.24s -> 22310.62s]  Why would the Among Us guy not play Among Us?
[22310.62s -> 22313.85s]  That makes no sense.
[22313.85s -> 22315.69s]  It would be a tear through this community.
[22320.19s -> 22325.63s]  Don't know.
[22331.34s -> 22332.30s]  It would be funny.
[22332.30s -> 22334.92s]  I think it would be funny for like a couple hours,
[22334.92s -> 22338.54s]  but I really don't want to have to bait people into being here
[22338.54s -> 22340.78s]  thinking that I'm going to be streaming Among Us
[22340.78s -> 22342.22s]  and that they stay.
[22354.57s -> 22356.49s]  I'm almost about to be level five blacksmith.
[22361.21s -> 22364.30s]  You're over exaggerating on the impact it would have.
[22365.18s -> 22365.58s]  I know.
[22367.34s -> 22369.02s]  Why do I think that's such a huge deal?
[22369.02s -> 22369.74s]  It just isn't.
[22370.70s -> 22373.02s]  That meme is so old and like dead.
[22373.02s -> 22374.38s]  It doesn't even matter.
[22374.38s -> 22384.81s]  All right, I'm going to be level five for tomorrow.
[22388.28s -> 22393.55s]  There it is.
[22394.27s -> 22395.07s]  Level five.
[22395.07s -> 22396.67s]  All right, I might as well just go until I can't.
[22397.31s -> 22400.30s]  It's not dead.
[22400.30s -> 22401.34s]  It's on its way out though.
[22408.06s -> 22409.10s]  Is Among Us still relevant?
[22409.10s -> 22409.34s]  I don't know.
[22409.34s -> 22409.98s]  I really don't know.
[22411.71s -> 22412.19s]  I don't know.
[22414.52s -> 22416.84s]  Okay, I thought I was married to the town crier for a second.
[22416.84s -> 22417.80s]  I was like, how did that happen?
[22425.96s -> 22428.68s]  All right, let's see how much money I can get doing it at level five.
[22430.04s -> 22430.60s]  I fucked it up.
[22435.88s -> 22437.40s]  Yeah, I'm going to I'm calling it here anyways.
[22437.40s -> 22437.88s]  We're calling it.
[22439.47s -> 22441.39s]  We'll pick up tomorrow with like 20,000 gold
[22442.03s -> 22443.79s]  and we'll do the next mission.
[22450.06s -> 22451.34s]  Change the title of the town crier.
[22453.23s -> 22454.99s]  People don't like salad dodger.
[22455.23s -> 22462.75s]  Nice bit of forging.
[22462.75s -> 22464.19s]  Oh, I also want to talk about this too.
[22464.19s -> 22466.75s]  This is very brief, but this is things to be excited about.
[22468.59s -> 22473.08s]  I am pleased to announce today that the third quarter of this year
[22473.64s -> 22475.72s]  is going to be fucking insane.
[22476.46s -> 22478.14s]  There are two streams.
[22478.14s -> 22480.30s]  I'm not going to go into detail of what they are at the moment
[22480.30s -> 22481.26s]  because I don't really need to.
[22481.26s -> 22482.22s]  I don't want to.
[22482.22s -> 22483.66s]  In August and September,
[22483.66s -> 22486.24s]  both of them are going to be bigger than the carnival.
[22486.24s -> 22487.40s]  Both of them.
[22487.40s -> 22490.12s]  So in August and then right after that in September,
[22490.12s -> 22491.16s]  there's going to be two streams.
[22492.78s -> 22501.47s]  And they're both larger than larger in scale than the carnival.
[22501.47s -> 22502.27s]  And you know what?
[22502.27s -> 22502.59s]  Fuck it.
[22502.59s -> 22504.03s]  I'll just say one of them is baseball.
[22504.03s -> 22507.40s]  Yeah, we are so close.
[22507.40s -> 22514.64s]  We are so close to completely locking that stream down.
[22514.64s -> 22516.40s]  And I'm so happy that we are.
[22516.40s -> 22517.44s]  I can't fucking wait.
[22518.88s -> 22523.04s]  I don't have any hard dates yet, but like we are so close.
[22523.04s -> 22530.04s]  But there's that's going to happen somewhere in like quarters three.
[22530.04s -> 22534.88s]  There's another stream that's going to be bigger than that.
[22534.88s -> 22538.24s]  That's happening somewhere probably in quarter three as well.
[22538.24s -> 22546.81s]  I can't wait.
[22546.81s -> 22550.14s]  You will get dates for these streams within the next,
[22550.86s -> 22552.06s]  I would say the next two weeks.
[22552.78s -> 22555.42s]  I will have probably hard dates for both of these streams.
[22561.53s -> 22564.01s]  There's also the grotto beast cards.
[22564.01s -> 22567.48s]  Oh, is it coming too?
[22567.48s -> 22568.92s]  Hopefully soon as well.
[22568.92s -> 22575.48s]  It's going to be fully loaded.
[22575.48s -> 22578.73s]  I told you back in because of COVID,
[22578.73s -> 22583.48s]  like three streams had to get completely just dumped.
[22583.48s -> 22584.28s]  Oh, that's it.
[22584.28s -> 22586.65s]  Now let me get 20,000.
[22586.65s -> 22593.90s]  And now we're really kind of turning the book in the chapter on that.
[22595.04s -> 22596.32s]  A lot more opportunities came up
[22596.32s -> 22599.37s]  and a lot of these streams were pretty much done.
[22599.37s -> 22602.09s]  The baseball stream was ready to go.
[22602.09s -> 22606.14s]  We were two weeks away from it happening before it was just too risky.
[22606.14s -> 22609.34s]  It was like we there was a bunch of the spikes in a lot of the places
[22609.34s -> 22612.41s]  and it was just we can't we just can't fucking do it.
[22612.41s -> 22613.05s]  I don't want to do it.
[22614.12s -> 22614.84s]  So we lost.
[22617.82s -> 22619.98s]  I spent money on that stream and it just never happened.
[22621.98s -> 22623.42s]  But I can't fuck around.
[22624.62s -> 22627.90s]  But now that's coming back and I can't wait.
[22627.90s -> 22633.02s]  So there's a couple of streams that were pushed forward
[22633.02s -> 22636.00s]  and you'll see them at some point in August and September.
[22636.00s -> 22648.78s]  All right, 20,000 and I'm out of here.
[22648.78s -> 22652.41s]  Oh, see you next weekend.
[22652.41s -> 22653.77s]  See you next Sunday.
[22653.77s -> 22661.76s]  I'll be live tomorrow, but still see you next Sunday.
[22661.76s -> 22663.04s]  You promised to watch Megamind.
[22663.04s -> 22664.56s]  Well, I didn't promise to watch Megamind.
[22664.56s -> 22665.60s]  I said I would consider it.
[22668.96s -> 22670.08s]  All right, only a few more.
[22670.08s -> 22671.40s]  Is that Otto?
[22671.40s -> 22674.89s]  Did Otto just bark at the door?
[22677.18s -> 22678.14s]  Hold on.
[22678.14s -> 22681.71s]  Otto, is that you?
[22682.67s -> 22686.86s]  All right, that's it.
[22689.45s -> 22691.13s]  I will see you guys tomorrow.
[22691.13s -> 22692.01s]  We'll call it here.
[22693.66s -> 22695.10s]  You promised to watch Megamind.
[22695.10s -> 22698.54s]  All right, I'll watch Megamind and I'll let you know how I think.
[22699.10s -> 22703.29s]  All right, let me save the game.
[22703.29s -> 22704.49s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[22704.49s -> 22706.40s]  Let's run the credits.
[22706.40s -> 22707.44s]  Thanks for all the community subs.
[22707.44s -> 22710.08s]  There were a lot of them from that Balls.
[22710.64s -> 22712.64s]  The Balls guy gave a lot of money.
[22712.64s -> 22716.30s]  It was like 50 community subs from Balsin.
[22716.30s -> 22717.10s]  Thank you.
[22717.10s -> 22723.72s]  And as always, everybody else today.
[22723.72s -> 22727.24s]  Thanks to Hassan.
[22727.24s -> 22728.12s]  Thanks to Chibli.
[22728.12s -> 22728.84s]  I missed this as well.
[22728.84s -> 22729.88s]  This is a raid.
[22729.88s -> 22732.25s]  I think I was in the middle of doing something.
[22732.89s -> 22733.61s]  I didn't see it.
[22733.61s -> 22735.77s]  But Chibli, thanks for the raid.
[22735.77s -> 22737.45s]  There's about 500 of you came from Chibli.
[22737.45s -> 22739.96s]  Thank you.
[22739.96s -> 22740.60s]  Yeah.
[22740.60s -> 22750.68s]  Yeah, see you guys tomorrow.
[22751.24s -> 22755.90s]  Let me save and continue to go.
[22755.90s -> 22761.90s]  Credits are off center.
[22761.90s -> 22762.30s]  I know.
[22763.18s -> 22763.98s]  I'm just terrible.
[22764.70s -> 22766.25s]  Let me see if I can fix it right now.
[22766.97s -> 22769.55s]  Got it.
[22769.55s -> 22770.11s]  There you go.
[22770.11s -> 22770.99s]  Look at that.
[22770.99s -> 22771.39s]  Perfect.
[22771.95s -> 22780.48s]  864p, Andy.
[22780.48s -> 22780.88s]  That's me.
[22780.88s -> 22782.24s]  Ooh, did I just turn this stream off?
[22782.24s -> 22782.72s]  Nope.
[22782.72s -> 22792.68s]  Can't wait for more polygamy and blacksmithing.
[22794.92s -> 22795.88s]  No, not so much.
[22795.88s -> 22797.56s]  I'm going to do missions tomorrow.
[22797.56s -> 22800.84s]  I'm going to actually go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, and do story stuff tomorrow.
[22800.84s -> 22802.75s]  Because I want to progress the game.
[22802.75s -> 22816.70s]  Am I going to finish it?
[22816.70s -> 22818.54s]  I don't think I'm going to be able to finish it.
[22819.85s -> 22823.45s]  We'll get pretty close.
[22823.45s -> 22830.81s]  But I don't think that I'm not going to do a 10-hour stream tomorrow to finish table two.
[22830.81s -> 22831.93s]  We'll see how far we get.
[22832.49s -> 22837.18s]  Do 1080p?
[22837.90s -> 22839.50s]  No, you don't want to do 1080p on Twitch.
[22842.11s -> 22846.51s]  To have good 1080p video, you need to have a bitrate that's higher than Twitch allows.
[22846.51s -> 22851.02s]  That's why I was in 720 for so long.
[22851.02s -> 22855.42s]  720p, 6,000 bitrate is good.
[22855.42s -> 22861.79s]  The more resolution you go up, if you don't increase your bitrate, it just looks worse.
[22861.79s -> 22867.47s]  So I have not increased my bitrate because I'm at the maximum.
[22867.47s -> 22872.35s]  What I did is I dropped my CPU preset until I can do NVENC.
[22872.35s -> 22875.23s]  And then I'm going to make it so that runs essentially through that.
[22878.92s -> 22882.80s]  So yeah, 1080 just is probably never going to work until
[22882.80s -> 22888.00s]  Twitch like I guess officially allows for like 10 to 12,000 bitrates.
[22888.32s -> 22890.32s]  I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.
[22890.32s -> 22896.03s]  But 864 is where I'm going to go for now.
[22896.03s -> 22900.96s]  Thanks again, everybody.
[22900.96s -> 22901.44s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[22902.16s -> 22902.88s]  Have a great night.
[22903.44s -> 22906.54s]  Your server costs would just go way up.
[22906.54s -> 22908.78s]  Yeah, I really doubt that would happen.
[22909.42s -> 22917.02s]  Do you have any plans for the 10th anniversary of your career?
[22917.02s -> 22920.22s]  You made it sound like huge plans were to be had, the big anniversary milestone.
[22923.64s -> 22927.96s]  I mean, not particularly, but there's like two or three streams that you're going to see
[22927.96s -> 22930.28s]  like after June, July.
[22932.06s -> 22937.18s]  That, I mean, there's just massive, massive amounts of work and time going into them.
[22937.18s -> 22941.66s]  So I guess you could say that these couple of streams coming up are kind of big
[22943.10s -> 22945.50s]  deals, at least for me, being here for 10 years.
[22946.88s -> 22950.27s]  I don't have anything particularly planned for like the exact day.
[22950.91s -> 22959.74s]  We'll probably, I'll probably just be like, oh, nice.
[22959.74s -> 22960.78s]  Yeah, it's been 10 years.
[22960.78s -> 22964.30s]  It's insane.
[22964.30s -> 22967.18s]  I can't believe people have stayed watching this channel for 10 years.
[22967.18s -> 22969.50s]  That just, it blows my mind.
[22970.22s -> 22975.07s]  Hey, thanks to you.
[22975.07s -> 22975.47s]  Thanks.
[22975.47s -> 22976.59s]  Hey, thanks to you.
[22976.59s -> 22977.39s]  Thanks, you boy.
[22978.19s -> 22980.19s]  And 10 community subs right at the end here.
[22980.19s -> 22981.71s]  Appreciate it.
[22981.71s -> 22984.83s]  Have a great night.
[22984.83s -> 22985.47s]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[22986.51s -> 23012.94s]  Take care of yourselves.
