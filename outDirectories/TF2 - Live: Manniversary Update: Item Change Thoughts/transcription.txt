[3.45s -> 13.30s]  Hey, what's going on guys? Jerma here with a live commentary. Just want to go
[13.30s -> 18.26s]  over a couple of things. I want to talk about the new changes to the existing
[18.26s -> 21.50s]  items and how they change them and what I think about it. I am really really
[21.50s -> 25.38s]  excited. I'm so happy about some of these two new changes guys. As you see there
[25.38s -> 29.58s]  I'm using the Widowmaker which is the new... I don't want to say new because
[29.58s -> 35.19s]  that's not really true. It's the new-ish shotgun and they find... oh my god I'm
[35.19s -> 37.95s]  going to... look at what I just did... going on an absolute tangent... oh my god
[37.95s -> 41.90s]  this is a century. I just killed three people... well two people with an assist
[41.90s -> 47.08s]  and I didn't have to reload and I had a million shots. It was amazing. This new
[47.08s -> 51.08s]  gun... what they did... let me tell you... if you're unaware they made the Widowmaker...
[51.08s -> 57.84s]  I'll show you... one, two, three, four, five, six. You can now shoot this gun six times
[57.84s -> 64.52s]  with 200 metal and even if you miss... if you miss once or twice it's okay. You're
[64.52s -> 68.16s]  probably going to be able to get seven or eight shots with this thing if you
[68.16s -> 71.92s]  miss a couple times. It's a great, great change. Oh my god I'm gonna get killed.
[71.92s -> 80.82s]  See this... three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... I just shot the gun nine
[80.82s -> 85.62s]  times without any reloads. That's more than the... what's the heavy one called?
[85.62s -> 89.90s]  The heavy shotgun... the family business. That's more shots than the family
[89.90s -> 94.31s]  business. The family business has eight and you have to reload it. Unbelievable
[94.31s -> 97.95s]  change. Hopefully I'm gonna try and go on a... some kind of tangent here. I'm not
[97.95s -> 102.07s]  even putting my sentry gun down. I'm being a real idiot. Oh it's on... this is
[102.07s -> 110.63s]  awesome. I'm so glad they did this. Oh what a backstab. So let me try this one
[110.63s -> 114.75s]  more time before I go into the other items. This is awesome. I'm so excited
[114.75s -> 117.59s]  that they did this because now I can unequip the Frontier Justice for a while
[117.59s -> 121.55s]  and use this. I'm not gonna say completely goodbye to the Frontier
[121.55s -> 127.66s]  Justice but at least for a while because they added this. This is so awesome. Okay
[127.66s -> 133.93s]  we're... there's a sentry over there. Oh my word. Let's see if I can pull this off.
[134.25s -> 140.22s]  There we go. Now notice how I have more metal than when I started with. What just
[140.22s -> 145.69s]  even happened? So I shot... I put down a mini sentry. I shot that Demoman two or
[145.69s -> 151.03s]  three times and I got back 40 metal. I'm pretty sure that it still gives you back
[151.03s -> 156.67s]  60 metal. So you shoot for 30 and you get back 60 if you land all the pellets on
[156.67s -> 160.83s]  somebody. So instead of before where you kind of was one for one, one for one. Let's
[160.83s -> 165.66s]  see here. Oh maybe not. It's 30 for 30. Okay. That's... that's still fine. That's
[165.66s -> 170.39s]  still awesome. I'm cool with that. So that's... I'm just so happy about this. Oh
[170.39s -> 175.31s]  they still have a teleporter up. Nice. Oh let's not... let's not reload one time and
[175.31s -> 181.14s]  just keep shooting this guy. Are you kidding me? Why is he not dying? What the
[181.14s -> 188.16s]  hell is going on? Are you serious? I haven't reloaded once. I haven't reloaded one time. Are you
[188.16s -> 194.76s]  kidding me? Why is this not being destroyed? Are you serious? What the hell just happened?
[194.80s -> 202.76s]  Why could I not destroy that teleporter? What the hell was that? Okay I want to
[202.76s -> 207.76s]  count after I'm done with this. I'm going to count. I think I shot like 30 rounds
[207.76s -> 214.76s]  in a row. Okay but don't ask me why that teleporter didn't go down. The engineer
[214.76s -> 217.44s]  must have been on the other side repairing it because that was pretty
[217.44s -> 222.54s]  ridiculous. I'm not gonna lie. That was pretty ridiculous. I think that's a spy
[222.54s -> 231.53s]  and maybe not. No it's not. I think there's a sentry over there. Nope. So you
[231.65s -> 234.65s]  guys get the idea. I'm gonna move on to the other items. Maybe see if I can get one
[234.65s -> 238.73s]  more kill. Nope. I'm gonna move on to the pyro and see if we can get something to
[238.73s -> 243.38s]  happen with the pyro. Oh nice black screen. So now please take a look at this.
[243.38s -> 249.00s]  The reserve shooter. You can now use it on the pyro. Very very cool. So let's see.
[249.00s -> 255.10s]  I'm gonna use the degreaser to get the fast switch. So essentially what you want
[255.10s -> 258.70s]  to try and do is you want to blast somebody in the air, switch over real
[258.78s -> 262.54s]  quick and get the mini crits. I am gonna love this guys because if you know how I
[262.54s -> 266.86s]  play pyro I play only pretty much with the shotgun. Where did that spy go?
[266.86s -> 271.42s]  Because he's around here. I could test it out on him. Oh well. Well I could test it
[271.42s -> 275.73s]  out on this dude over here. Heavy right here. Let's see if I can get behind him
[275.73s -> 282.62s]  or screw around with him. See if this works. Oh it worked but just not enough
[282.62s -> 287.63s]  damage. Oh this is ridiculous. So I'm gonna I'm gonna really like this. I
[287.63s -> 290.59s]  probably shouldn't have gone after that heavy. Actually what do I do? Why do they
[290.59s -> 295.21s]  light them on fire? They don't have to be on fire. They just have to be in the
[295.21s -> 298.93s]  air. Okay I don't know. I'm kind of freaking out about that right now. I
[298.93s -> 301.25s]  shouldn't have lit them on fire. Should have just blown them in the air just to
[301.25s -> 304.84s]  confuse them. Because yeah it's just when they're in the air when you switch over.
[304.84s -> 308.54s]  Now I wish they added the engineer. I mean they obviously they changed the
[308.54s -> 320.21s]  engineer a little bit but oh my god. Oh boy. Can I? Oh my god. Come on. Come on.
[320.77s -> 330.92s]  Nothing up here right? Did I get him? Sort of. Sort of. You do only get the three
[330.92s -> 336.80s]  shots up but I'm not concerned about that. I should be fine with that. Oh that
[336.80s -> 346.02s]  was awesome. Oh I could have just crit it. Oh come on. Oh damn it. I'm getting too
[346.02s -> 350.70s]  I'm freaking out too much about trying to get people in the air. I need to just
[350.70s -> 354.88s]  play pyro. Obviously I don't play pyro that often but when I do play pyro I use
[354.88s -> 358.14s]  the shotgun. So this should be really interesting setup. I'm gonna try one more
[358.14s -> 360.66s]  time because I don't want this to really drag on. So I'm gonna try this one more
[360.66s -> 365.66s]  time and see what happens. But yeah very very exciting. And one of the other
[365.66s -> 368.54s]  changes I'm gonna show you guys. One of the new changes they added but they
[368.54s -> 372.54s]  didn't really talk about it. And not very many people are talking about it is they
[372.54s -> 378.46s]  nerfed into the ground. Okay here we go. There we go. It's not doing a whole lot
[378.46s -> 383.18s]  of not doing a whole lot of damage. Usually a point-blank shot like that.
[383.18s -> 387.86s]  Mini crit. That should have killed them. Try this one more time. Actually no.
[387.86s -> 392.96s]  Not gonna be able to. I'm gonna try it one more time. But something that nobody really
[392.96s -> 399.00s]  talks about is they nerfed the shortstop. They made it 50% slower for reload.
[399.00s -> 402.72s]  And we might be even changing maps. And if we do yeah I'll see you guys in two
[402.72s -> 409.19s]  seconds. Okay we are back and we are on upward now. I actually changed service
[409.19s -> 414.06s]  because that one was going to a weird map that I didn't really know. So I'm
[414.06s -> 417.46s]  gonna show you guys. I'm gonna try and get a kill with this to try and
[417.46s -> 421.26s]  demonstrate it. Obviously if you've seen my previous live commentaries you know
[421.26s -> 426.02s]  that I'm pretty much a monkey in a box when it comes to trying to play in live
[426.02s -> 429.46s]  com at the same time. Don't know what that analogy even really means but I
[429.46s -> 435.40s]  just kind of made it up. Oh come on do that again. Do it again. Oh boink. Oh my
[435.40s -> 440.42s]  god I'm gonna die. So yeah yeah like I said before if you know my live comms
[440.42s -> 444.34s]  you know that I pretty much cannot play and talk at the same time because my
[444.34s -> 448.99s]  brain, at least in first-person shooters, it's hard for me to do that. Oh my god.
[448.99s -> 458.76s]  There we go. Nice. And this guy I'm gonna die. Oh don't you jump in the air. Don't
[458.76s -> 463.18s]  jump in the air. I got the reserve shooter. That was pretty cool. All right
[463.18s -> 470.40s]  let's get another kill and then I'll move on. Oh damn damn damn. I need heals. I
[470.40s -> 476.72s]  need to be healed. So this is very very cool. I'm so glad that they still care
[476.72s -> 480.52s]  about balancing the game even if it takes them a long time. Sometimes it
[480.52s -> 485.28s]  takes Valve a fairly long time to balance things and yikes. All right let's
[485.28s -> 489.32s]  see if I can get behind these guys and really mess up their day. Oh health I'll
[489.32s -> 495.68s]  take you and ammo. Thank you very much. What am I doing? I was like oh let me get
[495.68s -> 499.40s]  behind him or just pretend to get behind them and oh jump in the air. Jump in the
[499.40s -> 508.30s]  air. Okay looks like he's building a sentry. Ah damn it. I'm in a lot of
[508.30s -> 513.14s]  trouble because he's just got a sentry over there now. Maybe oh come on let's
[513.14s -> 521.78s]  cause a little bit of confusion. Oh my god he's back. No I'm so dead. I'm so
[521.82s -> 529.16s]  dead. I need that health. There we go. God I'm just like the oh my god. It's over
[529.16s -> 534.81s]  for me. Come on health spawn. I'm gonna have to go around the other side. Oh god.
[534.81s -> 542.02s]  Um can I reflect one of these rockets? No god. All right this is it. I'm gonna
[542.02s -> 547.46s]  change to the Scout just because this is kind of dragon. Oh goodbye. The question
[547.46s -> 552.16s]  is can I? No I'm screwed. Now it's over. All right I'm gonna change to the Scout
[552.16s -> 556.84s]  and show you guys the new change to the Scout. My god I have to put this on.
[556.84s -> 565.45s]  These don't really matter. Okay so the shortstop now as you can see. Let's see
[565.45s -> 572.50s]  one two three four. Oh man yeah the reload speed is 50% slower. It's a nerf
[572.50s -> 575.74s]  that nobody talked about. I'm gonna see if it really really affects gameplay.
[575.74s -> 582.05s]  Let's see this again. Yeah that's a lot slower. It used to be just pretty much
[582.05s -> 591.30s]  instant. Now it's about another couple seconds. Oh that yeah it's slow. That's
[591.30s -> 601.90s]  pretty damn slow. No I'm gonna get killed. Oh god. I want to kill that engineer.
[601.90s -> 609.70s]  Yeah there's a there's a pretty obvious difference. I don't think it's I don't
[609.70s -> 615.29s]  think it's really game changing or anything but I just got critzed and I
[615.29s -> 625.04s]  didn't do anything. I gotta get rid of that sentry. There we go. I didn't even do
[625.04s -> 638.04s]  it. Oh no no. Oh you are done. Oh reload time you are so slow. There we go.
[638.04s -> 644.31s]  I guess it's not too bad. A lot of it's not as fast as it used to be of course
[644.31s -> 649.83s]  but it's not terrible or anything. No boy I need to get healed or find a medic.
[649.83s -> 659.30s]  I got milk. I got the milk. I'm fine and give me that health. Give me that health.
[659.30s -> 667.98s]  Give me that health. What? Oh alright so it's not that big of a deal. I thought it
[667.98s -> 672.97s]  was gonna be terrible. It's okay. What else did they change? Obviously besides
[673.53s -> 678.01s]  I have to show you this just because I have to. So here's a look at my heavy.
[678.01s -> 685.92s]  Look at how ridiculous he is. Look at how stupid he looks now. I'm so glad. Look at
[685.92s -> 690.20s]  this because they made the the mask a miscellaneous item. So I can look like a
[690.20s -> 696.98s]  scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz now. Alright I'm gonna just I'm gonna end it
[696.98s -> 700.90s]  here. Just wanted to get a video out showcasing the new stuff the new changes.
[700.90s -> 705.98s]  Obviously I can't go over all the hats because I mean hats. Hats are hats. You
[705.98s -> 709.86s]  guys know the deal about hats. So let's just end this by going on like a tirade
[709.86s -> 715.51s]  as a heavy as the scarecrow heavy. Yeah!
[715.51s -> 722.15s]  Oh see you later sentry. I need a medic. I need a medic. Why I don't even know why
[722.15s -> 729.10s]  I have the shotgun equipped. I should have the sandwich equipped. Hmm hmm.
[729.10s -> 736.26s]  Oooh I can get rid of you. I can get rid of you. No I can't. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap.
[736.26s -> 742.77s]  Crap crap crap come on, and I'll get this one over here, and that engineer is
[744.03s -> 747.95s]  Next time hey next time he goes to get metal. It's all over for this century. Oh
[750.26s -> 758.73s]  Come on go get metal go get some metal. Oh, yeah, there's nothing you can do now
[759.93s -> 764.02s]  Except that soldier can kill me for sure. Oh, it's gone
[764.94s -> 765.94s]  ooh
[765.94s -> 773.38s]  Before he kills me gimme gimme all right. Maybe we can actually win this now here. We go time to drop down
[773.70s -> 775.70s]  Let's get on that cut
[775.74s -> 778.00s]  How did I not that was weird?
[778.56s -> 786.09s]  There we go there. We go got to get rid of you got to get rid of you
[786.57s -> 800.88s]  What what's going on? No? It's up there. No spy you bastard. Give me on the cart. Give me on the cart. Oh
[803.60s -> 808.62s]  Jumper's gonna cap it as heavy and now we got okay. Come on over here. Come on over. Oh
[811.06s -> 813.06s]  I just have to get over here
[813.10s -> 817.84s]  Come on, and that's all she wrote we're gonna win. That's the end. Oh come on
[819.48s -> 821.48s]  Yeah
[821.48s -> 826.16s]  Nice all right guys. Thanks all so much for watching. I will see you all next time
[826.44s -> 830.04s]  hopefully you enjoy some of the new changes the new hats all the new things in the
[831.05s -> 838.61s]  Mano the Mano economy the man economy you anniversary god. I can't even talk, but yeah, see you all next time take care everybody
