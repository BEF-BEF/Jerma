[3.00s -> 45.94s]  Oh shit, what happened? All right, hold on. Let's skip suffocation. Oh thank god it's,
[45.94s -> 60.68s]  Elevitz is actually in here. Oh thank god. My goodness, imagine if it wasn't. Okay,
[60.68s -> 89.50s]  all right, let's go. Elevitz, you're gonna like this one. I don't know, what am I titled the
[89.50s -> 95.10s]  stream now? Like fucking magical creatures? Finding magical creatures? You like clean a house in this
[95.10s -> 98.46s]  game. I'm gonna love this. I was gonna save this for like tomorrow because this is what I was
[98.46s -> 102.94s]  thinking about doing tomorrow, but we're doing it today because these fucking video games I'm lied to.
[103.98s -> 124.84s]  Scam recovery. Let's go. I have to buy rabbits again. Elevitz is such a good game. Oh I know.
[124.84s -> 137.69s]  Sometimes you gotta pull out the big ones. Searching for magical creatures. There you go.
[139.54s -> 157.86s]  Your face cam. This game is actually like the ultimate PogChamp. You guys are gonna love this
[157.86s -> 167.08s]  game. All right, story mode, multiplayer, extras, we're gonna do story. In this tutorial you can
[167.08s -> 170.92s]  learn how to play the game and view advanced tips. Would you like to start the tutorial? Yes!
[180.31s -> 187.32s]  Oh fuck, hold on. This is searching for magical creatures with Cabela's Deer Hunt still on the
[187.32s -> 205.64s]  game title. How about, I don't know, clean your room. Clean your room. Done. Here we go. With the
[205.64s -> 209.56s]  remote, pointing at the sensor bar, slowly move it left and right to look, stop being so tangled
[209.56s -> 218.15s]  or I'll bite it. Okay, you can also look up and down, look up and down, left and right.
[218.87s -> 225.10s]  Let's give it a try. Let's try. It's really, it's really like high quality fluid game too.
[225.66s -> 236.46s]  It's really, really fluid and high quality. Okay, next step. Try slowly moving the cursor up,
[236.46s -> 240.94s]  down, left, and right. You move the camera. This is a really high quality fluid fucking experience.
[241.90s -> 256.12s]  Keep it in the blue frame. Slowly move the cursor up and down and keep it in there.
[256.92s -> 268.15s]  This is an incredible game. Yeah, I know. It was either this or I was gonna put in Beautiful Joe.
[268.15s -> 286.26s]  I had to, I gotta pull out all the stops here. Let's learn how to move. Move forward by slowly
[286.26s -> 291.06s]  tilting the nunchucks control stick forward. Tilt the control stick backwards and move backwards.
[291.06s -> 295.46s]  Tilt it left right. You move. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The thing to remember here is to point the
[295.46s -> 303.22s]  Wii remote the direction you wish to move. Let's give it a try. All right, let's see if we go.
[303.22s -> 312.15s]  Ready? Pick it up. This is moving up, down, you strafe, you tilt. All right, now let's do it with
[312.15s -> 322.49s]  the, with the controller. This is VR movement. You guys don't understand. This game is one of
[322.49s -> 327.06s]  this. This is probably the best game, probably like one of the top 10 games on the Wii and you're
[327.06s -> 332.74s]  about to see it live and in person on German 985. I'm selling this game up so high because
[332.74s -> 338.49s]  the last hour and 40 minutes has been a disaster. So I'm trying to just keep you here. All right,
[338.49s -> 351.86s]  let's learn how to crouch or C to stretch Z to crouch. That's a stretch and that's how you
[351.86s -> 363.10s]  scrunch. Stretch, scrunch, stretch, scrunch. Good. Live from Las Vegas and I got a face cam on.
[363.82s -> 371.51s]  Are you serious? What a day to stick around on the stream. Please, god, don't fucking leave.
[375.86s -> 379.86s]  Grabbing objects or catching elements is referred to as capturing. Let's learn how to capture an
[379.86s -> 383.62s]  object. You can grab objects by holding the capture beam over them during the game.
[384.34s -> 386.98s]  Press the A button or the B button of the Wii remote to shoot out the capture beam.
[387.62s -> 391.78s]  The beam will shoot while the button is down. If an object is too heavy, the cursor will turn
[391.78s -> 395.70s]  red while you point at it and you will be able to grab but not capture it.
[396.66s -> 415.42s]  Let's go. People saying F. F. Why F? While holding an object, move the Wii remote in the desired
[416.14s -> 428.36s]  gray. You can move it left, right, up, down. Why are people doing F? Oh, it's the block. Okay.
[429.24s -> 432.58s]  While holding an object, move the Wii remote back into pull it, move it forward to move it.
[432.58s -> 435.38s]  Yeah, you go like this. Twist the Wii remote left or right while holding an object to tilt
[435.38s -> 439.40s]  that object. You can open the doors. Try moving the red object into the red frame
[440.28s -> 461.08s]  and the blue object into the blue frame. Let's give it a try. Go. Got it. This is not a toddler
[461.08s -> 467.08s]  game. This is a cleaning game, which means I'm going to play them all. All right, we're almost
[467.08s -> 474.06s]  done. I'm going to have to back up a little bit I think here, which means I have to put pants on.
[474.06s -> 476.70s]  We're going to have to take a break and I'm going to have to put like fucking pants and like underwear
[476.70s -> 482.54s]  on and stuff. Like, uh, that's just, I'm just giving you real. Next, let's learn how to capture
[482.54s -> 489.29s]  an elephant. Look at these little things. An elephant is a living entity with a mysterious
[489.29s -> 494.71s]  energy. If you capture one, that energy will cause various things to happen. After an elephant
[494.71s -> 498.71s]  pointed it with the cursor and pushed the A button, the elephant enters your capture gun and tank
[499.43s -> 504.47s]  as watts. Watts of the game's unit of energy collect watts to fill the light bulb gauge,
[504.47s -> 511.11s]  which will turn blacked out lights back on. Give it a try. Here we go. After the yellow goods.
[511.91s -> 533.19s]  He's going to get banned one day. I've got him. All right, that's it. I'm going to take a break
[533.27s -> 538.31s]  here in a second and I'm going to put on clothes. I have clothes on, but it'd be more appropriate
[538.31s -> 547.00s]  clothes because I'm going to have to fucking move back for this. How to use capturing to do various
[547.00s -> 553.70s]  things. You can use the capture gun to grab and open or close drawers. Yep. Grab a drawer and pull.
[554.74s -> 568.34s]  Let's give it a try. Let's try it. There's an elegant mirror. You search for these things
[568.34s -> 575.51s]  through the whole house and you get them all and you can use them to turn on stuff. That's how you
[575.51s -> 582.38s]  turn a faucet or doorknob. Use the capture gun to grab a faucet and twist it. Let's go. Sometimes
[582.38s -> 589.24s]  they come out of the water. This game sucks. No, it does not. That's so, so unbelievably wrong.
[590.12s -> 609.18s]  It's such a good game. Yes, it is. Elephants are hiding. Grab items and shake them. You just go
[609.18s -> 628.17s]  like this. Okay. Okay. Got it. You're trying to hype this game. We'll see. We'll see how you feel
[628.17s -> 638.33s]  about 15 minutes. Thought break sound. What about it? This would make a good VR game.
[638.97s -> 646.34s]  It would. Elephants love small nooks and crannies and to hide between under things.
[646.34s -> 660.60s]  Find and capture them to turn the lights back on. Let's go. I'm going to have to stand up for this.
[660.60s -> 667.37s]  You're going to see the full boomer race. This is, I think this might turn into a stand up stream.
[667.93s -> 686.60s]  All right. What else we got? Here we are. Get them all. Yeah, this is going to be a stand up stream,
[686.60s -> 698.04s]  I think. The pants on. Don't worry. I'm going to. All right. Now the lights turn back on.
[698.84s -> 709.96s]  Would you like to do the next tutorial? Yeah. Streamer stands for the first time in six years.
[717.30s -> 720.82s]  Stages include doors that won't open until you have enough watts. The doors show how many watts
[720.82s -> 741.38s]  are required to open them. See? Let's go. A door somewhere just opened. Oh, there it is.
[742.02s -> 761.61s]  Let's go. Excuse me. This is a Pikmin ripoff. Oh, that's. No, that's not even remotely. That's
[761.61s -> 781.69s]  not. Just wait. Just wait 10 minutes. This is a stand up comedy stream. This game sucks. Oh, man.
[782.49s -> 789.08s]  Imagine if you just didn't know. Imagine if you didn't know. You know what I mean? I can't
[789.08s -> 795.06s]  imagine not knowing. Okay. Electrical appliances display the amount of watts required to use them.
[795.06s -> 799.22s]  So once you gather enough watts, they will turn on. Once an appliance is usable, point at the
[799.22s -> 805.96s]  switch with the butt sensor and press the A button after the cursor changes. Turn on the appliance.
[807.00s -> 831.80s]  150 for that. EV is energized. Turn it on. Look at that. What do you mean? What sensor?
[833.59s -> 837.75s]  Okay. Increased capturing power. I'm just getting my memory refreshed. You're stealing cable.
[847.29s -> 852.87s]  Oh, it's kind of pog, I guess. When you use an electrical appliance, yellow and pink
[852.87s -> 857.67s]  elements come out. These elements are called power elements. Capture power elements to charge
[857.67s -> 863.27s]  up your captures gun power gauge. Build this gauge to level up the gun's capture power.
[863.99s -> 869.11s]  When the level increases, you can carry heavier objects. Capture power elements and level up your
[869.11s -> 897.90s]  capture power. Interesting. TV energized. Let's go. Telephone energized. I can now carry 2.2
[897.90s -> 928.87s]  kilograms of material. Look at that. The game still sucks. You're making a mess. All right.
[928.87s -> 942.20s]  Review what you've learned so far and capture even more elements. The movement's so fun, too.
[942.76s -> 950.52s]  A door somewhere has opened. Good. We're not done collecting elements.
[956.06s -> 957.98s]  Telephone has been energized. Toy train energized. Let's go.
[966.14s -> 973.45s]  Gotta get them all. Open the fucking door.
[974.25s -> 1026.78s]  Okay. I gotta stand up. Here we go. Ready? Oh, level three. Open everything. This would be a wicked
[1026.78s -> 1034.09s]  fun VR game. I know it would. All right. We got it. This is Viscera cleanup details are the worst.
[1034.09s -> 1038.25s]  What's with you guys today and only giving games like 12 seconds before you want to change?
[1039.29s -> 1050.06s]  What's going on with you guys today? This is like one of the best Wii games to release.
[1051.02s -> 1060.34s]  We can smell when a game sucks. Oh, no, you cannot. No, you cannot. I refuse to have you
[1060.34s -> 1068.26s]  guys say that this game sucks. It's like saying that Mario Sunshine sucks. I mean, it doesn't.
[1068.90s -> 1073.14s]  Okay. Items may have special effects such as temporarily improving gun capture performance.
[1073.14s -> 1081.24s]  Check this out. Grab an item and smash it to activate it. Here we go. Ready?
[1082.04s -> 1108.97s]  Homing laser locks on and grabs multiple elements. There are lots of items you can get.
[1115.14s -> 1125.24s]  Now this is my dopamine levels just exploded. Yeah. Elevates are emotional living beings that
[1125.24s -> 1130.28s]  cry, dance, and even run away in terror. Depending on the state of an elephant when you capture it,
[1130.28s -> 1134.20s]  the amount of watts you acquire will also vary. When an elephant is running away,
[1134.20s -> 1138.04s]  its watts will decrease and the bubble that appears when you capture it will turn red.
[1139.24s -> 1143.72s]  When an elephant is stressed or unconscious, they provide a normal number of watts. This
[1143.72s -> 1148.28s]  capture bubble will be white. Elevates that are sleeping or singing provide a higher
[1148.28s -> 1153.16s]  number of watts. This capture bubble will be as blue. Watch the elevates' actions carefully
[1153.16s -> 1159.88s]  and try capturing in the different states. All right. That one was having fun. Someone's sleeping.
[1159.88s -> 1166.84s]  That one's confused. That one's crying. See how it was different. Okay. Now let's like scare them.
[1167.48s -> 1181.56s]  Let's like throw a box over here. EM pulse ball knocks out all elevates in a range. Oh, it just
[1181.56s -> 1188.82s]  has to be around. Okay. They're all sleeping when this is around. And it makes them just
[1189.38s -> 1208.95s]  trying to collect. This game gets really fucking hard too. All right. What about here? Fleeing is
[1208.95s -> 1219.58s]  red. Yeah. You want to try to get them in a good state. Get to the first boss. Elevate cookie
[1219.58s -> 1226.06s]  attracts elevates for a time. So you go like this and they'll go after it. Go get that cookie. Wake
[1226.06s -> 1240.94s]  up. Eat this cookie. Oh, you're all idiots. Whatever. I only have this in all the items,
[1240.94s -> 1262.87s]  right? Do I have to just get them all? All right. We're good. Nice work. Electrical appliances.
[1262.87s -> 1276.92s]  Didn't we already do this? Gotta catch them all. Just skip the tutorial. Point to various places
[1276.92s -> 1280.44s]  with the cursor and look for activation methods. Some objects are activated in combination with
[1280.44s -> 1285.18s]  other objects by grabbing parts and moving them. All right. You can turn on like the coffee makers
[1285.18s -> 1309.29s]  and shit. Okay. I think we're almost done. You're getting hard blinks chat. The legendary pink
[1309.29s -> 1314.92s]  elevates are the rarest of all. Capturing them unlocks a new game mode. You gotta, you gotta
[1314.92s -> 1321.98s]  catch them all. Look at them. There are always three pink elevates on each non-boss stage and
[1321.98s -> 1326.30s]  they will appear in different ways. The first hides normally, but the second is in a potter's shoe,
[1326.86s -> 1330.54s]  which you will eat eventually. The third appears next. Once the special conditions are met,
[1331.26s -> 1336.68s]  find them all. There. You happy?
[1339.74s -> 1342.54s]  All right. Watch the fucking opening cut scene where I go put on pants.
[1412.02s -> 1425.29s]  Over to their research lab and left me at home. I don't care. My favorite show will be on TV soon.
[1426.62s -> 1438.63s]  Huh? That's right. Electricity and cars only work because of elevates, you know.
[1439.19s -> 1459.18s]  Wouldn't even be able to watch TV without them. Pick them up with my fair hands. I know. I'll use
[1459.26s -> 1461.26s]  Dad's capture gun.
[1478.15s -> 1545.69s]  Hey, look, we're in my room. I can choose the music.
[1548.10s -> 1562.18s]  You went to go buy raving rapids. What music do I want? No shit. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait,
[1562.18s -> 1565.06s]  wait, wait. I'm not ready. Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Pause it.
[1565.06s -> 1573.62s]  I can't. You can't pause the game. All right. Screenshot. Here. Now I can move back a little.
[1573.62s -> 1595.64s]  Let me move the mic. Let me move the camera. Full backpack cam. Incoming. He's wearing overalls.
[1597.13s -> 1611.34s]  No, I've got my fucking like bionic chest plate. I've got my, I've got my carapace on. Level one
[1611.34s -> 1618.26s]  armor. Yeah, this is, this is like fighting game person armor. You know what I mean? This is like
[1618.26s -> 1623.54s]  the, oh yeah. Am I protected? Just don't hit me here, here, here, here, here, here, here, or
[1623.54s -> 1634.78s]  anywhere, anywhere else in my whole body. PUBG armor. All right. I'm ready. I'm ready to fucking
[1634.78s -> 1645.74s]  play this game. No, the camera's not even in the right spot. Fucking big ass arm. Wait a minute.
[1646.38s -> 1679.72s]  Wait a minute. Why does that look like that? Oh my God. I'm gonna play the game now.
[1680.36s -> 1688.20s]  Unless it's the angle. I'm moving, I'm changing the angle. All right, we're good.
[1688.20s -> 1691.54s]  Are you ready for this fucking game? I'm ready. Here we go. 350 watts. Turn TV on.
[1692.34s -> 1713.22s]  Don't wake him up. Yeah, I know what it does. Fucking Igor. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1714.10s -> 1729.86s]  Anybody in there? Stretch my head up. Okay, good. I can't, I don't have enough. Wait, hold on.
[1730.50s -> 1744.74s]  TV turned on. We got ready. I have enough, right? No, not, I don't have enough. Fuck.
[1745.46s -> 1753.67s]  How do I leave the house? Can I leave the room? Not yet. Toy train's been energized. Turn it on.
[1764.39s -> 1774.39s]  All right, I got level two power. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Open up, open, open.
[1776.25s -> 1786.55s]  How do I turn this fucking thing off? All right, the lights are on. Finally. All right. Under the
[1786.63s -> 1808.30s]  bed. TV's on. Turn it on, turn it on. Come on, come on, turn it on. Get in there. Smash the TV.
[1808.30s -> 1840.57s]  No, no, no, not yet, not yet. Fuck out of the way. Rip it off the fucking wall. Why,
[1840.57s -> 1845.08s]  why am I doing this in this kid's room? I still don't have any more.
[1851.37s -> 1867.93s]  Holy shit, what's in there? Blue RC car has been energized. Where is it?
[1868.89s -> 1876.86s]  Oh, I am the kid. Where's the blue RC car? I just like, it's like a fucking robbery. All right.
[1876.86s -> 1898.22s]  Where's the RC car? There it is. What? Where's the car? How much do I need? 1200 watts. Fuck.
[1900.42s -> 1911.86s]  I need more than that. Come on. This is literally the opposite of cleaning.
[1912.82s -> 1915.22s]  Oh, there's the car, there's the car. Oh, there it is. Okay, it's over here.
[1916.18s -> 1923.91s]  Level three. Finally. All right, we can pick up the bed. Pick up the desk.
[1939.48s -> 1953.35s]  Um, got them all. You can clear the mission without, you can clear the mission without
[1953.35s -> 1962.87s]  completing. Continue? I mean, I did it, right? Wait, I don't understand. You can clear the mission
[1963.43s -> 1973.66s]  without completing? Just keep going? Just say yes? No? Total capture 97. I gotta fucking see.
[1974.54s -> 1986.06s]  Gotta see. You have to clean everything. No, I don't. You can now play this mode and score attack.
[1986.06s -> 1998.22s]  Cool. You can keep powering up, right? Okay. Next level. Mission two.
[1999.34s -> 2003.53s]  Play normal missions. You proceed through the game. Here we go. We're in the hallway.
[2004.81s -> 2015.58s]  The game is unnerving. Why? You like collect little creatures.
[2015.90s -> 2023.35s]  Elebits in the closet. Capture a thousand watts of elebits in 10 minutes. Go. I want to get in there.
[2023.35s -> 2046.06s]  Here they come. Ready? Slow, slow, slow, slow. I don't want to, like, wake them all up.
[2048.70s -> 2062.23s]  Here we go. Don't want to make everybody freak out. Hair dryer has been energized. All right,
[2062.23s -> 2068.98s]  where's the hair dryer? Where's the hair dryer? Oh shit, there's a cookie. Okay, hold on.
[2069.38s -> 2077.53s]  Electric drill. I don't want to use these cookies yet. Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Get this out here.
[2077.53s -> 2086.70s]  All right, turn it on over here. I need a thousand, right? Yeah, the music's fucking good.
[2087.34s -> 2109.10s]  Flashlights energized. Keep that open. Can't pick these up. Flashlight. Shit. Flashlight. Come on.
[2111.72s -> 2129.34s]  Flashlight. Floor lamp. All right, floor lamp. Here we go. Turn it on. Let's go. Wait, they're
[2129.34s -> 2134.10s]  stressed. They're stressed out. I don't want to capture them when they're stressed.
[2134.74s -> 2144.89s]  Wait, they're stressed. They're stressed out. I don't want to capture them when they're stressed.
[2144.89s -> 2157.88s]  475? What else was it? More subs? Five subs from you posted cringe, bro. Ten subs from you
[2157.88s -> 2164.12s]  posted cringe, bro. I'm sorry about that. Didn't mean to. Thanks for the ten community subs.
[2166.79s -> 2171.27s]  Uh, thanks a lot. And then SNK had ten community subs while I was gone.
[2172.39s -> 2176.92s]  Thanks a lot, guys. All right, I can pick shit up now. What do I want to pick up?
[2177.80s -> 2194.87s]  Let's get this stuff out of here. The door somewhere could be open. Oh, shit. They're
[2194.87s -> 2202.52s]  on the- they're down here on the stairs. Why is that one dead? Which door opened? This one?
[2208.81s -> 2229.16s]  Open. I took too long, so he died. Oh, shit. Okay. There we go. Here it is. All right. How is
[2229.16s -> 2238.86s]  there nobody in there? Why do you have a fucking urinal in your house? Why is there a- why is
[2238.86s -> 2254.86s]  there a- actually that's pretty fucking- that's incredibly smart. I would love to have a urinal
[2254.86s -> 2294.04s]  in my house. Got ya. You can't hide from me. Urinal. This is like Superman's piss. Blue piss.
[2294.68s -> 2322.07s]  Nothing else in here, right? Dr. Manhattan. All right. There we go.
[2330.98s -> 2344.50s]  I'm blocking myself in the bathroom. No, get the fuck out of my way. Go out the bathroom.
[2349.43s -> 2360.36s]  No, I'm staying. I'm staying. I'm staying. Look at all these things energized over here now.
[2361.24s -> 2364.63s]  I can open this. All right. We're gonna throw the cookie. I'm gonna- okay, I'm gonna turn on a bunch
[2364.63s -> 2370.33s]  of shit. And I'm gonna- here we go. You ready? I want that cookie. I'm gonna get the cookie ready.
[2371.21s -> 2378.15s]  I'm gonna make sure I get them happy. I already checked this out. Let's get this open.
[2380.71s -> 2385.11s]  I know. I know people like- I know they like the cookies. I get it. Everybody loves fucking
[2385.11s -> 2400.78s]  cookies. 30 seconds for the cookie. Turn it all on. Turn everything on. Quick. Go get the cookies.
[2412.41s -> 2426.63s]  That was it? 30 seconds to turn this on? Legendary. I got the legendary.
[2449.69s -> 2463.62s]  Honey, what's going on upstairs? Sorry, sweetheart. I was gonna find these little weird fucking
[2463.62s -> 2479.51s]  creatures and pick them up. Honey, there's nothing up here. Yes, there is. You don't see them?
[2501.06s -> 2506.26s]  Honey, honey, you're just pissing all over the place. Sorry, I'm not very tall, but I'm using my
[2506.26s -> 2547.22s]  elitist radar. Why is it still locked? Get this out. Oh, okay. Shaking shit. All right, move it out.
[2547.22s -> 2572.50s]  Get it out of the way. One minute. I've destroyed everything. What else is there to fucking break?
[2573.62s -> 2587.85s]  Oh yeah, that screen title is Clean Your Room. This is not how you clean a room. That's- yes.
[2588.01s -> 2597.45s]  I am- yeah. Oh, wait, this is the bathroom, right? I think I got everything I can.
[2604.36s -> 2624.50s]  Chibi Robo prequel. All right, any more? One here. I think I got everything. Not much else to move.
[2628.52s -> 2646.47s]  Oh, yes, there is. What's in the corner here? Umbrella. Come on. Wait, I can- I could go down
[2646.47s -> 2657.80s]  the stairs? I thought I couldn't go downstairs. I thought it was just the closets. Hey, there's an A.
[2658.60s -> 2686.52s]  You can edit shit? How would you edit? Are you drinking Windex? Sure. Windex is blue.
[2687.24s -> 2692.25s]  People can- that's a fucking feature, whatever. I don't care. People are gonna make fun of me.
[2705.69s -> 2712.79s]  At all the grocery stores, all the fucking water is gone. And sometimes, in some of them, what's
[2712.87s -> 2719.27s]  left is like the expensive stuff. So this is all that was available to buy at the grocery store
[2719.27s -> 2734.38s]  because all the fucking other water is gone. Just boil the water. All right, mom and dad's room.
[2734.38s -> 2737.58s]  1,500 watts of elevates for mom and dad's room. Music number three, let's go.
[2739.03s -> 2750.89s]  Get this one clean. Don't break that cookie. Don't break that cookie. Not yet.
[2760.71s -> 2767.74s]  Get them all in the middle of the room. I'm gonna press these all at the same time.
[2777.02s -> 2787.99s]  Don't play. Don't do it yet. Come here, you little shit. Epson picture mate.
[2788.71s -> 2806.23s]  Door somewhere could be open. All right, hold on. All right, I'm ready to start turning these on.
[2811.93s -> 2838.87s]  All right, here we go. Fuck. Sorry. Ready? Turn this on. Break it. Break it. Here we go.
[2839.91s -> 2865.67s]  Easy. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't break. Don't throw the whole thing over. Fun. Another one. Level two.
[2865.67s -> 2894.82s]  Level two. Hurry up. Just lost that shit under the bed. Turn the lamp on. Missing on the lamp.
[2897.37s -> 2923.00s]  All right, stay still. Mini TV has been energized. All right, where is it?
[2923.88s -> 2931.02s]  All right, I just locked myself in here. Actually did. I don't think I can leave.
[2931.90s -> 2963.46s]  It's all right. Shirts. Move them. Why can't I move the shirts?
[2964.50s -> 2979.61s]  It can't be opened yet. Why? What? That lamp has been energized. All right, let's go.
[2981.37s -> 2984.01s]  This should put me over the... Wait, can I pull the bed?
[2984.01s -> 3009.96s]  I'm like major focusing right now. Anybody in there? Anybody in here? No.
[3013.91s -> 3016.23s]  Antique radio. I got to get the fuck out of the bedroom.
[3018.10s -> 3034.02s]  Let me out of the bedroom, please. I can't move the books. One, two, three,
[3034.02s -> 3050.41s]  four, five, one, four, two, four. I don't know what this is. Shredder activated. All right,
[3050.41s -> 3076.57s]  there's a lot of shit in here that's activated. Bro, these urns. Flashlight has been activated.
[3078.65s -> 3125.16s]  No. What do you mean grandpa? Oh, turn it on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3125.16s -> 3135.61s]  Oh, it hurts. Turn the fucking thing on for God. Turn it on. What the fuck?
[3136.01s -> 3177.05s]  Ugh. Cookie, cookie, cookie, smash cookie. Yeah, I got it. I'm gonna stick around. I'm
[3177.05s -> 3185.77s]  gonna destroy all these books. This is the satisfying part of the whole mission.
[3240.73s -> 3249.88s]  Watch out, the police are coming. Wait, out here. This is all the shit I can do out here, right?
[3254.30s -> 3255.50s]  All these drums open in the rung.
[3255.50s -> 3272.73s]  Am I strong enough to move this shit? How can I not be this strong?
[3290.01s -> 3295.77s]  There are, there's like a, like, there's like a piss joke here with like the Sith piss versus
[3295.77s -> 3302.58s]  fucking Luke Skywalker piss. I don't know if I can make it right now though. I just have to pee
[3302.58s -> 3325.29s]  into each other. Whatever. It's there somewhere. Oh, that's cringe, bro. Oh, I might need to tighten
[3325.29s -> 3339.58s]  this. He's not even making jokes. No, I'm not. I might have to actually tighten this. What did
[3339.58s -> 3349.94s]  I mess up here? What's the vest for? Uh, there's a whole lot of it. You would like a new tutorial.
[3349.94s -> 3365.96s]  What's this, what is this for? This is an improved boomer brace? Kind of. All right, I'll give you the
[3365.96s -> 3371.16s]  TLDR. I have a really bad pain in my ribs and my spine. I might have rheumatoid arthritis and
[3371.16s -> 3375.40s]  costochondritis and I have to wear this sometimes because my whole body hurts. There you go, there's
[3375.40s -> 3387.08s]  the TLDR. All right. Breakable objects have a mark on the lower right. Be careful when handling
[3387.08s -> 3392.86s]  these objects. If you drop or throw these objects, they will break. Gently put them back down. Else,
[3392.86s -> 3396.38s]  keep in mind that fleeing elements can crash into objects and knock them down. So be careful
[3396.38s -> 3411.77s]  in such situations. Look around before turning appliances on. Okay. Looks like life is actually
[3411.77s -> 3425.85s]  painful. Kind of. So I can't like just smash stuff anymore. I can't break anything. How am I, how am
[3425.85s -> 3435.80s]  I going to be able to do this? Don't break seven objects. I've been just whipping shit around.
[3437.98s -> 3455.50s]  Oh my God. Okay. Don't break anything. If I haven't broken anything, we're good.
[3457.43s -> 3460.15s]  I didn't break. What did I break? What did I break? What did I break? What did I break? What did I break?
[3460.15s -> 3477.88s]  I didn't break anything. What did I break? I didn't break shit. Oh, this vase is everywhere.
[3477.88s -> 3498.71s]  All right. Put them down. All right. Slowly. Are these bottles of water going to break? No,
[3498.71s -> 3516.68s]  they made it a plastic, right? All right. I almost have enough. I'm going to back up a little bit.
[3519.16s -> 3526.79s]  Flashlight energized. All right. The lights are coming on. Thank God.
[3538.94s -> 3553.62s]  Don't break anything. All right. We're okay. 15 minutes to do this. I can slow down. Why am I
[3553.62s -> 3574.78s]  going this fast? What turned on the lamp? The lamp. Okay. This is, it's going to shatter.
[3575.80s -> 3596.34s]  This doesn't count as me breaking something, right? Good. Level two. Not yet. Huh? Really?
[3596.34s -> 3603.45s]  Go downstairs. See, I see you can't go downstairs. The music's tight. Yeah, the music is really good.
[3605.13s -> 3632.12s]  The door opened. Oh, I did it. Hold on. Oh, I did. You're right. All right. Don't break anything.
[3632.12s -> 3645.48s]  Just slowly do it. Oh, don't break it. Don't break it. Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.
[3645.48s -> 3687.42s]  I have 12 minutes. These are pens. A colorful PC. All right. Now, careful, careful. I can lift
[3687.42s -> 3726.81s]  shit up now. All right. Okay. It didn't break. Gamer posture. Oh, I'm going to have to tighten
[3726.81s -> 3735.75s]  myself off. It's starting to, it's starting to hurt. I think it's the way that I'm holding the
[3735.75s -> 3742.07s]  Wiimote maybe and like going like this and just tensing up a little. It's kind of annoying, but
[3743.75s -> 3747.59s]  we'll see. I'm all right. I'll tighten it a little bit at the next mission.
[3753.43s -> 3757.43s]  Jesus Christ. I love elephants. I know. It's great. Okay. Be careful. Here we go.
[3758.31s -> 3789.38s]  Somebody in here. I lost control of the stream on that one. Plates. What do I need? 2,500?
[3789.38s -> 3797.35s]  20 watts do I need? What else is new? I've lost control of the stream.
[3797.99s -> 3830.92s]  Eh, it's a typical Saturday then. Here we go. Turn it on. Still not enough. What's, this is for the
[3830.92s -> 3839.91s]  Wii. What system is it for? It's for the Wii. Oh shit, I can go over there. Wait, can I move this?
[3840.63s -> 3860.15s]  All right. Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. Slow. TV is now energized. Got a pink one? This is a lot. Oh shit.
[3866.31s -> 3894.58s]  One sec. He's killing them. Where am I going? I'm just, I'm just tightening the back. What's
[3894.58s -> 3910.12s]  he wearing? Here we go. There we are. One more, one more side. Don't hurt yourself playing the game.
[3910.12s -> 3916.76s]  No, I'm all right. I'm just, this morning too, it was actually, I woke up worse this morning,
[3916.76s -> 3937.05s]  but I'll be fine. Invite Bugleberry to play with you. No, not giving up. Here we go, that's better.
[3937.05s -> 3942.41s]  Quick, invite Frog Detector. Where's this TV?
[3951.42s -> 3964.18s]  None of this shit is able to be, nothing in here is breakable. It's fine. All right, new door, new
[3964.18s -> 3975.37s]  door. I broke something. What did I break? Let Bugleberry play instead. No, if I, if I,
[3976.25s -> 3980.09s]  you guys know me, man. If it gets to be too much for me, I'll just, I'll just see you tomorrow.
[3981.53s -> 3999.94s]  You know that. It's happened once before. Can't break a picture, right? Bugleberry, no, Bugleberry's
[3999.94s -> 4015.93s]  not gonna play this. He's not even good at this game. That was like angry how hard I threw that.
[4015.93s -> 4029.46s]  I picked that up off of my head and fucking just whipped it into the wall. All right,
[4029.46s -> 4037.24s]  there's another door I can go on. Let's turn this on. All right, don't break that vase, easy.
[4038.76s -> 4069.83s]  Can I move these yet? Nothing breakable in there, it's fine. Oh shit, they're on the walls. Come on,
[4072.68s -> 4094.65s]  do it. Where are the elements? Oh, no, get me back out there. Give me, I just hurt it. Where are they?
[4094.65s -> 4148.76s]  Okay. All right, watch out. Toilet, energized. Heater, energized, good. I'm not, I'm not trying,
[4148.76s -> 4160.01s]  I'm trying to pull it off. Where's the heater? All right, let's do the cookie right in the middle.
[4165.83s -> 4168.95s]  Heater, energized. Heater, energized. It's right here, right? There it is.
[4169.59s -> 4174.60s]  30 seconds, fuck. I'm not, I can't move the boxes yet.
[4174.60s -> 4183.86s]  You're gonna stop, you're breaking our marriage?
[4186.71s -> 4225.32s]  3500 to turn this on, shit. Okay, we're fine now. It's the worst thing to do right now,
[4225.32s -> 4257.51s]  is like sneeze. He's getting sicker. I'm fine. I sneezed once. I was here because he sneezed.
[4258.15s -> 4266.86s]  I still haven't beat the fucking level. No, I'm saying it's bad because like that like detracts
[4266.86s -> 4311.13s]  my chest muscles and chest and shit. Where is he? Wait, somebody out here. I'm breaking in.
[4311.77s -> 4335.51s]  Why is it so hard for me to open a door? I'm done for. I'm gonna lose. Sometimes you gotta
[4335.51s -> 4341.16s]  crack a few fucking eggs to make your breakfast in the morning, whatever it is. What do you know
[4341.16s -> 4362.79s]  what I'm saying? It's gonna be only two of you in here. How did I move the bed? No, move the bed.
[4362.87s -> 4382.82s]  How did I move the bed so much? Air purifier. Where? There it is. 30 seconds, shit. I'm gonna
[4382.82s -> 4422.22s]  lose. I need 3000, right? Turn on. Come on. Come on. Hurry up, please. Where are they? Get out of there.
[4422.22s -> 4447.46s]  Where the fuck are, what? I think I lose. Oh, I got it. Thank God. I got it. Hey, I'm from the future.
[4447.46s -> 4453.70s]  Jerma doesn't do it. Well, you must be from the wrong future. I'll get what I can in 15 seconds.
[4453.70s -> 4472.90s]  I didn't get to go in the other room. At least I got to go in the bathroom. Wrong timeline.
[4473.70s -> 4492.33s]  Jerma, I beat Mario. Are you proud of me? Of course I am. It's a really hard game. Keep touching
[4492.33s -> 4507.59s]  your face. Well, I'm like, I know I really shouldn't be doing that, but I've been washing my hands.
[4508.31s -> 4513.03s]  All right, we get to do the kitchen. I'm gonna do the kitchen mission. Sure, I'll do a tutorial.
[4513.67s -> 4528.17s]  Quick, you're losing more piss jokes. So, you make noises. You don't want to make too much noise.
[4529.21s -> 4534.41s]  The volume gauge will fill as you make noise. When a certain line is passed, the count will decrease.
[4535.13s -> 4545.32s]  Zero is a mission failure. So, don't make noise. Don't let them run around. Okay, I get it. Hey,
[4545.32s -> 4547.32s]  we got a cut scene.
[4568.46s -> 4571.08s]  You better take my gun.
[4579.62s -> 4592.60s]  Gotta go. Be careful with that gun. It was like, the dad was just doing a tuber voice.
[4594.20s -> 4603.83s]  Okay, be sure when you have that Eliebrits thing, you don't fire it too quickly. I gotta go.
[4603.83s -> 4618.26s]  See you in the next episode. That's TTS voice. That is TTS voice. All right, the silent kitchen
[4618.26s -> 4640.28s]  after 4,000 watts. Oh, I can hold on. I'm gonna save that. It's just bread, man. Why would it take
[4641.24s -> 4647.72s]  that loud? Why is bread this loud? Oh, I dropped a fucking pot on the ground.
[4657.94s -> 4678.15s]  Noise canceler. Eliebrits won't hear noises. Okay, I have an idea. I mean laser. Yeah, here we go.
[4678.15s -> 4715.78s]  Oh shit, they can hear noises again. I just, I was passing out and you know when you're passing the
[4715.78s -> 4723.77s]  fuck out and then you lie down for a second and the world starts to come back? That's just what
[4723.77s -> 4732.18s]  that felt like. Oh, I have to insert what? Insert coffee. Insert toast. Insert toast in the toaster.
[4732.90s -> 4799.58s]  Is it not toast? Where's the coffee maker? Oh, this is gonna be insanely difficult to do this.
[4802.28s -> 4808.92s]  Got it. All right, I can't get the fucking toast in there. It's gonna take too long.
[4809.96s -> 4820.31s]  What do I need to put in the oven? Insert what? There's already a turkey in there.
[4821.19s -> 4836.42s]  TTS.
[4848.34s -> 4866.25s]  Put a potato in there? Everybody is the... what? There we go. Come on, get level two.
[4868.65s -> 4878.31s]  I still can't get this fucking toast in here. Dude, there's no way you're gonna get this toast in
[4878.31s -> 4907.69s]  there. Cancel all sounds. Okay, throw the pizza fucking everywhere. Break everything. All right,
[4907.69s -> 4945.96s]  give me the hoeing missile. I'm gonna beat it right here. What's the goal of this game? Is to
[4946.60s -> 4951.40s]  capture elli bits and transfer them into energy and then use the energy to open doors in your house
[4951.40s -> 4969.61s]  and turn your lights back on. Five, four, three, two, one. That felt fucking good.
[4971.69s -> 4975.93s]  Level three. Don't make noise. All right, what needs to go in here? What do you put in the microwave?
[4976.89s -> 4983.29s]  Uh, what goes in the microwave? What kind of food is on the floor? Onion. Uh, apple.
[4985.29s -> 5019.54s]  Bread. Metal. No, no, no, stop. Aluminum foil. It's like a front-loading dishwasher. Mustard.
[5031.08s -> 5061.74s]  You motherfucker. Open and stay open. Stay open. Oh my fucking god. Stay open. Stay open.
[5065.37s -> 5070.94s]  Every microwave does this shit and it's so irritating. This is actually what happens
[5070.94s -> 5073.18s]  when you have a real microwave. But this is, this really happens.
[5073.98s -> 5079.90s]  Stop doing that. Why do they, why does it do that shit? This is not a game problem. This is like,
[5079.90s -> 5095.02s]  that's a real world problem. Oh fuck, I can't make noise. It's upside down. What the fuck do I put
[5095.02s -> 5109.53s]  in here? Bread? What about the turkey? Should I put the turkey in there? How long would it take
[5109.61s -> 5116.07s]  to microwave a full turkey? Okay, it takes, it takes like four and a half hours to bake a
[5116.07s -> 5140.14s]  turkey in the oven. If you microwave a turkey from raw, what, how long would it take? I can't
[5140.14s -> 5150.98s]  move otherwise I'm going to fail the mission. Wait, Mr. Bean did that? Wait, where'd you go?
[5150.98s -> 5157.56s]  Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Wait, Mr. Bean really did that? He microwaved a whole turkey?
[5162.50s -> 5180.89s]  That's, that's very, very, that's very funny. That's very funny. What should I put in there?
[5182.01s -> 5201.90s]  I don't want to make any noise. Link the funny turkey video. Don't make any noise. Please just
[5201.90s -> 5224.34s]  pick it up. I'm going for a C. Wait, it's real. Oh, it's real. All right, after this, after this
[5224.34s -> 5232.71s]  level, um, I'm going to watch the Mr. Bean funny turkey video and take a second in the fridge.
[5233.59s -> 5249.61s]  Oh, shit, is it this? Yeah, we're going to do a react to the Mr. Bean video. Yeah, it's just,
[5249.61s -> 5258.90s]  it's bothering me. It's actually bothering me. That's why I was wearing it today. 12 minutes.
[5259.78s -> 5283.64s]  Preemptive Pog. Movie, movie night! Standing up help? No. Unfortunately. Take a break? Yeah,
[5283.64s -> 5293.34s]  that, don't, we will. I'm not, I won't push it. This game's fun though, but it's something about
[5293.34s -> 5300.65s]  this, like, way I'm holding it. I don't know. I had issues this morning. So let's watch the Mr.
[5300.65s -> 5305.13s]  Bean fucking turkey video. That sounds like fun to me right now. All right, hold on. Let me get it.
[5305.77s -> 5323.59s]  Where is it? This looks like it's going to be very funny. This video is 12 minutes.
[5325.69s -> 5347.83s]  Thanksgiving Bean. Mr. Bean. Wait, what? This is a 12 minute video. All right, hold on. I'm coming
[5347.83s -> 5367.14s]  over here. Plug this in and let's check it out. Bean Crew. Get this on the screen for us to watch.
[5368.02s -> 5384.39s]  Get it in a browser. Okay, here we go. Mr. Bean. Thanksgiving at Mr. Bean's house. Oh,
[5384.39s -> 5401.93s]  are we watching each other on each other's TV? This is nice. There is something we have to talk
[5401.93s -> 5411.96s]  about. This looks new. I don't quite know how to put this. What I am concerned about is, whoever
[5411.96s -> 5421.16s]  that is, I am getting rid of them. That's the guy from Ghostbusters 2. There he is. David, sorry
[5421.16s -> 5431.10s]  we're late. I love this guy. Terrible. You couldn't believe it. It's just the way she, it's the green.
[5432.22s -> 5439.82s]  No, it's the yellow. It's just, it's the yellow. Well, where is Allison? Well, I've got some bad
[5439.82s -> 5447.34s]  news and some good news. The bad news is that Allison has had to go visit her mom who, well,
[5447.34s -> 5454.22s]  is not well. That's too bad. Wait, this is from a movie? The good news is that Dr. Bean and I
[5454.22s -> 5461.58s]  will be cooking. But he's, that's Dr. Bean? Of course it is. All the greatest chefs in the world
[5461.58s -> 5472.62s]  are men. So what's on the menu, maestro? What the hell did you give them? What are we going to do?
[5473.26s -> 5476.06s]  Yes, I think they may be expecting something slightly more formal.
[5479.42s -> 5487.29s]  Hot dog. Just on its own? No, no, don't be ridiculous. It's for Thanksgiving. Allison would
[5487.29s -> 5497.80s]  kill me. Microwave the raw turkey. There must be something else. One of these before. Why would
[5497.80s -> 5512.78s]  it take like five hours, right? Not necessarily. No fucking, what? Why? How long did they do this
[5512.78s -> 5520.70s]  for? 20 minutes. I don't know. 20 fucking minutes. No, I'm not hungry. You're the chef,
[5520.70s -> 5527.99s]  just put on some vegetables. Wait, is the Mr. Bean video game? Holy shit, that's disgusting.
[5529.59s -> 5537.03s]  Maestro, my taste buds are positively tingling with anticipation. Play the Mr. Bean game.
[5542.47s -> 5546.95s]  No, no, thanks. I would actually eat those. I would eat those. They look good. I actually
[5546.95s -> 5555.11s]  kind of like raw onions. I'm a fucking weirdo. So Bean? Big day Tuesday. Your big day. My big day.
[5555.75s -> 5567.50s]  I have a question for you. Let's see what it looks like. He's very attentive to detail.
[5569.11s -> 5592.07s]  Everything must be just so. What? Is he all right? Is Mr. Bean okay? Bean, I think we need to be
[5592.07s -> 5599.37s]  honest with each other. I cannot deny that over the last days some suspicions have begun to
[5600.09s -> 5604.79s]  gather in my mind, and I would just like to ask you some direct questions.
[5608.18s -> 5628.20s]  Number one, are you a doctor? Okay, I can't do that. Why are you watching Mr. Bean? This is a
[5628.20s -> 5639.22s]  fake gamer stream. I gotta take a break, man. I'm fucking, I'm in pain. Watch the whole movie. I
[5639.22s -> 5653.46s]  can't watch this whole movie on stream. I'll get removed from Twitch. Fake react channel.
[5654.90s -> 5663.10s]  Just watch all the clips in order. No, you can't do that. I can't just watch every scene from Mr.
[5663.10s -> 5669.16s]  Bean the movie in separate YouTube videos back to back. I mean, that's like, that's skirting the
[5669.16s -> 5673.88s]  rules a little, and I would probably get some, I'd probably get reprimanded for something like that.
[5673.88s -> 5680.06s]  Give me, like, give me another Mr. Bean clip. I want to watch like a funny Mr. Bean clip. Any
[5680.06s -> 5711.38s]  other funny, like, classic Mr. Bean clips? Okay, here we go. Let's take a look. You got one here?
[5712.10s -> 5718.84s]  What's this one? Not, that's, that's a, I know, I know, that's a, that's a gnome.
[5719.96s -> 5726.10s]  Here comes a Bean stream. This is the Crispus Turkey funny clip. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[5726.10s -> 5730.70s]  wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. There's more than one Mr. Bean funny,
[5730.70s -> 5748.36s]  like, Thanksgiving turkey clip? Hold on, there's more than one?
[5791.66s -> 5795.67s]  It's just classic Mr. Bean comedy.
[5804.01s -> 5834.10s]  Christmas sucks.
[5839.77s -> 5840.73s]  Merry Christmas.
[5845.10s -> 5858.97s]  Wait, is he feeding the mouse Christmas cheese? Oh, holy shit, Mr. Bean.
[5870.70s -> 5898.86s]  That looks like a fucking folded up person. That's a, that's a human. This is a human.
[5903.40s -> 5911.83s]  Holy shit, that's a huge fucking turkey. That's a person. Mr. Bean is fucked.
[5924.98s -> 5926.98s]  Any more Mr. Bean turkey videos that we haven't seen?
[5927.86s -> 5944.04s]  Why is he taking it out? He lost his watch. Oh, he lost his watch in the turkey.
[5945.24s -> 5963.70s]  I knew it was going to happen. He's fucking a head crap. It's one of those scientists from Half-Life.
[5965.40s -> 5970.12s]  Holy shit, that's what it would look like if it was in real life. Holy fuck, that's terrifying.
[5971.00s -> 5976.52s]  Thank you.
[5992.52s -> 5995.24s]  All right, any more? I want more Mr. Bean food related videos.
[6019.83s -> 6034.49s]  I want, is any other Mr. Bean turkey related videos? Is there another Mr. Bean turkey video?
[6043.32s -> 6048.95s]  Sandwich? There are hundreds of Mr. Bean turkey related mishap videos.
[6049.83s -> 6053.86s]  This one, one last one. This one, this one. Just found it, found it, found it.
[6055.30s -> 6067.88s]  That's not it. This is a turkey one. Please watch this one. Should have watched this during Thanksgiving.
[6069.00s -> 6072.71s]  You guys are all, Lincoln says random shit. These aren't, these aren't even Mr. Bean.
[6073.59s -> 6091.75s]  Seafood bean. Mr. Bean, no, no, no, no. This is the one. This is the best one. This one is a French restaurant.
[6092.23s -> 6101.98s]  I love this one. No, it's got to be food related. Seafood is the best one. All right.
[6103.02s -> 6111.74s]  All right, every time some people, half of these. Okay, somebody just linked the scene where
[6111.74s -> 6117.48s]  Ace Ventura comes out of the rhino's ass. That has nothing to do with Mr. Bean. That's like,
[6118.04s -> 6133.46s]  honest to God, what the fuck are you talking about? Is this it? No, that's not it. That's,
[6133.46s -> 6143.05s]  that's, that's like a turkey, turkey video. Okay, here we go. Somebody got it. Somebody got it.
[6143.05s -> 6154.79s]  Somebody got it. Thank you so much. Thank you. Here we go. Oh, you don't know about Sprite, Ginger.
[6157.93s -> 6169.38s]  What?
[6175.43s -> 6178.39s]  He lost his voice. It's the same video.
[6178.55s -> 6180.79s]  He lost his voice.
[6187.03s -> 6191.43s]  It's the same fucking thing. It's the same one. I love it.
[6200.36s -> 6207.35s]  There's just no laugh track on this one. Now listen, David, I want a straight answer.
[6207.35s -> 6211.11s]  What do you think about the mayor? Oh, you know, maybe I should just go in and help.
[6212.71s -> 6215.99s]  No, please sit down. The doctor is in complete control of the situation.
[6219.59s -> 6229.19s]  You see, the problem with the mayor is that, well, how can I put this kindly? He's a total idiot.
[6233.27s -> 6236.55s]  This city needs this leadership, vision, vision.
[6237.59s -> 6241.51s]  No, I don't think you're going to get that from a compromised career politician.
[6242.47s -> 6247.35s]  Who wants to be in charge of this? Which is why George should be running for office.
[6248.55s -> 6254.15s]  This is a germist dream. Excuse me. This is a germist dream.
[6256.54s -> 6259.98s]  It goes all right there. Yes, thanks.
[6277.19s -> 6279.35s]  Wait, is this the same movie? 20 minutes.
[6285.03s -> 6290.47s]  Put some vegetables on it. Come and say hello. Wait, is this the same movie? Is this the same one?
[6299.53s -> 6307.75s]  You found another turkey one? Is this, is this actually another turkey one? That's not it.
[6329.72s -> 6339.46s]  The world isn't black and white. There's no set.
[6340.18s -> 6368.22s]  Oh, please go on his head. Please go on his head. Go on his head and have him hit walls and shit.
[6368.22s -> 6387.06s]  Please pinch your soul. Half a dozen oysters. Oh, they forgot to clean this one.
[6387.06s -> 6398.38s]  What the fuck is he doing? It's a germist dream. A can of peas.
[6400.02s -> 6404.66s]  It's a germist dream. We just say things that we're doing and then we do the same thing over and
[6404.66s -> 6421.74s]  over again. Oh, can of peas. A couple of oysters. A dozen oysters. Can of peas. It's classic humor.
[6421.74s -> 6439.77s]  It worked. Oh my god, he's going to get stuck. That's it? That can't be it. What do you mean
[6439.77s -> 6443.59s]  that's it? There's another classic turkey one.
[6463.34s -> 6472.47s]  Hello? Phoebe? Joey? What's going on? Get off the screen.
[6481.74s -> 6492.90s]  Dad, how did you get on? Hunter scared Chandler. Then help me get it off. Plus,
[6492.90s -> 6498.50s]  it smells really bad in here. Of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
[6500.10s -> 6519.50s]  Okay, this is going to be...
[6538.58s -> 6557.53s]  It's going to be the exact same thing. Shit, that was pretty sick.
[6562.23s -> 6564.71s]  That was a microwave. What the fuck? You got to do the same thing.
[6564.71s -> 6584.34s]  Oh. French fries and turkey. But it didn't go on his head. This isn't funny. I don't find this
[6584.34s -> 6599.59s]  humorous. It's not on his head raw. I swear to god, I fucking promise you, there will be a time,
[6599.59s -> 6607.11s]  not today, not tomorrow, not next week. I will do a fucking... Look at how funny it is with turkeys
[6607.11s -> 6611.67s]  on his head. I'm going to stuff a turkey joke. I promise you. What the fuck is going on?
[6632.44s -> 6650.89s]  Aurora Borealis. Smithers, whatever your fucking name is.
[6650.89s -> 6667.37s]  It's supposed to be as funny as the actual turkey joke.
[6676.34s -> 6687.13s]  He's breathing in the smoke. That wasn't even funny. Yeah, that kind of sucked, to be honest with
[6687.13s -> 6712.98s]  you. Okay, that's enough turkey videos for now. That's enough. No more turkey. No, no, no more
[6712.98s -> 6722.86s]  turkeys. No, I'm not playing the other one. No, this one, I don't want to play this one. No more.
[6722.86s -> 6726.54s]  No, he doesn't even do anything funny with this. He's just holding it in his hands.
[6731.74s -> 6738.52s]  Watch this, please. Watch this. This is toilet humor, Mr. Bean. No, no, we're not watching Mr.
[6738.52s -> 6760.76s]  Bean piss it into a urinal. The last one, please. Hold on. Oh, okay, fine. Do people still think
[6760.76s -> 6765.26s]  that's fun? How many of you guys, do people still think that that's funny?
[6766.38s -> 6773.67s]  Oh, the turkey joke. Oh, it's just like a Jerma stream. He does like kind of the same shit every
[6773.67s -> 6781.19s]  time. Let's link the streamer, the fucking gnome video every stream. You and I are not so different.
[6781.99s -> 6788.07s]  Hey, click this link. It's the, it's the, I think this is funny still. We're not so different,
[6788.07s -> 6805.54s]  you and I. Why do I need the lyrics? No, I'm not watching any more turkey videos.
[6806.42s -> 6828.01s]  That was a good break. Now, what do I want to do now? No, no more chicken videos. Clean your room.
[6832.07s -> 6836.71s]  Let me, let me stand up for a second. Let's actually take a just an actual BRB. I want to
[6836.71s -> 6842.31s]  stand up and like move around just a little bit. I think I'm going to take the brace off
[6843.54s -> 6850.66s]  and just move around a little. Give me one second. I will be right back. I'm going to take this off.
[6851.62s -> 6940.55s]  I've moved up and down a little. I don't want to say this, but I'm going to.
[6941.75s -> 6948.50s]  I'm going to have to call it here. I'm sorry. I got to like, I don't know what I'm going to do,
[6948.50s -> 6956.60s]  go lie down or something. This is hopefully not going to start happening more frequently
[6956.60s -> 6960.36s]  because this happened like a few weeks ago where it just like, I couldn't do anything and it was
[6960.36s -> 6969.29s]  just uncomfortable. So I'm just going to call it. Not going to push it. I don't want to. Sorry,
[6969.29s -> 6976.46s]  we only have like a three and a half hour for probably four hours stream, but we'll be,
[6976.46s -> 6981.34s]  I'll be back tomorrow. Tomorrow is going to be an interesting day because I'm going to play
[6982.06s -> 6986.38s]  the game that is on the GameCube. That is a microphone game. I don't know if you want to
[6986.38s -> 6999.50s]  miss this one. That's a microphone based video game. It is called Oh Dama. You control an army
[6999.50s -> 7008.01s]  with your voice while you throw a boulder into buildings. It's going to be a little weird,
[7010.87s -> 7017.00s]  but sorry. Uh, that the last like probably full hour or so I just was have not been that
[7017.00s -> 7022.49s]  comfortable and I really just want to kind of just, unfortunately I have to stop.
[7023.61s -> 7030.38s]  It started once I started playing like Elevates. I think this is the way that I was holding and
[7030.38s -> 7038.60s]  just how I felt earlier today. So I will see you tomorrow. Um, I'll make sure like,
[7039.32s -> 7045.02s]  I don't know what to do tomorrow, but I'll try to rest up and make it so I can sit here longer
[7045.02s -> 7047.66s]  because I was fine. Yes, this is, but I think this is, you know, this is like,
[7047.66s -> 7052.70s]  that's so annoying about this. It's like yesterday. I was, I was live for like eight
[7052.70s -> 7056.54s]  fucking hours yesterday and I was like, fine. I didn't need the brace and they woke up today
[7056.54s -> 7060.78s]  and it was just like, fuck. It like hurts. Put the brace on. It helped a little bit,
[7060.78s -> 7069.86s]  but you know what I mean? It's like, come on, man. Like this annoying. We'll see you tomorrow.
[7069.86s -> 7079.42s]  We'll do it again tomorrow. I'm going to play Oh Dama. I'll see you then. It'd be the weather.
[7079.42s -> 7092.47s]  No, I don't think so. I don't think so, but we'll see you tomorrow. Does he know that he needs a
[7092.47s -> 7103.19s]  mic? Oh, I have a mic. Actually, you know, let me see. Make sure it's in here. Oh, it's in here.
[7103.19s -> 7124.76s]  All right. I have to, hold on. Let's actually want to show this. So here is the GameCube Nintendo
[7124.76s -> 7138.17s]  microphone in the package still. Let's take it out. And apparently this does work in here.
[7138.17s -> 7149.22s]  Did I just ruin this by putting my dirty fingers all over? What else can you use this with? I don't
[7149.22s -> 7153.78s]  know. Apparently it works in the Wii. I know. I'm going to make sure it works before I turn the
[7153.78s -> 7161.22s]  stream on. Check the disc. Check the disc. Check the disc. Why does this have to be a thing? Why do
[7161.22s -> 7168.26s]  I have to like make sure this shit's in here? Here it is. Oh Dama. Oh yeah, it's in there.
[7168.26s -> 7174.89s]  It looks pretty. This is like a really sleek case too. Live unboxing. Here you go. There it is.
[7175.53s -> 7181.99s]  It's a nice case. Take a look in here. It's like a, like a really nice case. It's got the manual too.
[7183.58s -> 7195.22s]  Pretty nice case. It looks, this looks big for GameCube game. Doesn't it look kind of big? This is
[7195.22s -> 7202.47s]  like, does it look bigger? I don't know. Maybe. But that's the plan tomorrow. Uh, everything's in here,
[7202.47s -> 7209.27s]  so that's good. Uh, if you missed the stream today, uh, my body hurt. I got scammed and uh,
[7209.27s -> 7214.79s]  we watched Mr. Bean stuff his head in a turkey four times. Pretty good Saturday. Pretty good
[7214.79s -> 7223.88s]  Saturday stream. I think so. So I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a great rest of your day and we'll
[7223.88s -> 7246.66s]  see you tomorrow. Thanks for the catch up. Sorry for Rick rolling you. The classic fucking food
[7246.66s -> 7253.62s]  mishap video. I love it so much. Take care guys. See you tomorrow. We'll do the bits. I'll hang out
[7253.62s -> 7267.06s]  for a little bit. Let's go over here. So earlier we had, uh, we had Spigot the bear for five dollars.
[7267.06s -> 7273.54s]  Thank you for the 500 bits. Hey Jerma, as a verified 2006 gamer and god skater, do you think you would
[7273.54s -> 7283.98s]  ever stream Bully? You do the Wii version for some boomer exercise. Um, I don't know. Aren't they
[7283.98s -> 7288.14s]  making another one? Aren't they like remaking it or something? Wouldn't they? I heard they would like
[7288.14s -> 7295.16s]  redoing it or there was going to be a second one or I'm kind of just waiting on that. Not confirmed.
[7295.16s -> 7310.22s]  Oh, they aren't. Oh, it got cancelled. Oh, oh, cancelled. Oh, okay. There's been so many rumors
[7310.22s -> 7318.79s]  about Bully 2. Yeah, I've played Bully. I played it a long time ago, but maybe let's get through all
[7318.79s -> 7322.15s]  this stuff first. I still have a bunch of stuff that I want to play and try on like the Wii and
[7322.15s -> 7328.47s]  the GameCube. Some classic, some not so classic. Obviously, I still have Eternal Darkness that I
[7328.47s -> 7334.23s]  want to play, which that's a classic. That's going to be really fun. Uh, both the beautiful Joes,
[7334.23s -> 7344.18s]  No More Heroes 2. Those still have to come up and be done. When can we expect more Cabelas?
[7344.90s -> 7351.26s]  Never. But thanks for the five dollars. Uh, Bulbaswag, thanks for the 500 bits. With the
[7351.26s -> 7358.60s]  coronavirus, Clown of the Town would have a new risk factor. Clown of the Town is just impossible
[7358.60s -> 7364.12s]  to do without 500 million dollars. I followed just for Cabelas. Well, I'm sorry. You probably
[7364.12s -> 7369.80s]  should unfollow if you followed for Cabelas, because that is the first and only time you will
[7369.80s -> 7377.08s]  ever see a Cabelas video game streamed on this stream. It's not going to happen probably ever
[7377.08s -> 7384.76s]  again unless, unless I get scammed again and somebody puts the wrong disc into a game that
[7384.76s -> 7394.78s]  I purchased. So if I buy like Raving Rabbids again and there's a Cabelas 2006 disc in there,
[7395.86s -> 7407.05s]  sure, got scammed. Well, I keep getting scammed with these used games. And that was live. That
[7407.05s -> 7422.15s]  was a live, I got fucking scammed. I can't believe it. I'm so annoyed by that. Send him a cabinet.
[7422.15s -> 7429.66s]  What a sucker. Hello again, mister. Thanks for the 250. Hey Jeremy, I just came back from Portugal
[7429.66s -> 7433.74s]  where I got to see my girlfriend for the first time in a while. When I got back I had to go into
[7433.74s -> 7439.18s]  quarantine where I'll be for 14 days. Getting back home to your stream made the situation easier to
[7439.18s -> 7449.94s]  bear. Thank you so much. Hopefully, um, you're good to go. Kind of a scary time right now.
[7450.10s -> 7457.26s]  Just uncertainty and what exactly this is and what it does. And it is kind of at that point
[7457.26s -> 7465.51s]  right now. We're, we're trying to ease the amount of infections as much as we can, I guess. So just
[7465.51s -> 7471.67s]  be careful. Take care of yourselves. Stay, obviously stay clean. Wash your hands. Don't go
[7471.67s -> 7477.19s]  anywhere. You don't have to go. That has a lot of people there. I mean, this is just basic stuff
[7477.91s -> 7486.18s]  unless for a little while, right? Yeah, it's, it's not, it's not a joke.
[7486.18s -> 7498.09s]  There's no joke. Be careful. Why did you cancel E3? I was looking for what I didn't have. What?
[7499.13s -> 7504.20s]  I'm a guy that sits in his underwear and watches it and like drinks coffee and like,
[7505.32s -> 7511.13s]  I have nothing to do with you. What are you talking about? Hey, uh, Sybeck, thanks for the
[7511.13s -> 7516.33s]  $15 Sybeck. Here, Jeremy, take some money to never do that fucking woody bit again. Well,
[7516.41s -> 7521.93s]  I can't promise that won't happen. Considering how many turkey mishaps you've seen on this stream,
[7521.93s -> 7530.30s]  I'm sure you'll see it again soon. Thanks for the $15 though. Appreciate it. Hey, smelly boy,
[7530.30s -> 7534.38s]  thanks for the $2.50. I'm not kidding when I say big game hunter 2005 was the first game I ever
[7534.38s -> 7538.94s]  played when I was like seven on my PlayStation 2 and it made me so happy when you started playing
[7538.94s -> 7546.57s]  it. It made me so happy when you got scammed. Can you imagine sitting here watching a stream
[7546.57s -> 7550.17s]  and it's like, Hey, I'm going to play raving rapids. It's like, Oh, okay. I guess that's what
[7550.17s -> 7556.57s]  he's going to play. And I opened the case and it's holy shit. It's the first game you've ever
[7556.57s -> 7563.50s]  played, like tricked you. We're on Egypt and I'm playing Cabela's and it's like, Whoa, that's the
[7563.50s -> 7575.42s]  first thing I've ever done. That's just weird. Isn't it? That's like a moment for one person.
[7575.42s -> 7587.30s]  That's the one guy. Thanks for the $2.50 though. Uh, option. I, well, thanks for the $3.47. If
[7587.30s -> 7591.70s]  Drew crew ever puts you under too much pressure, Jeremy, I can delete German walk and leave them
[7591.70s -> 7605.82s]  in shambles. Holy shit. You hold all the power. Oh man. That's a lot of power that you hold.
[7606.62s -> 7615.99s]  The nimble pickle. Thanks for the $15. It was my birthday yesterday and I just want to say,
[7615.99s -> 7619.99s]  thank you for six plus years of entertainment. Also, when do you plan on playing Viva Pinata
[7619.99s -> 7626.84s]  again? It was a great stream and we want more. Um, after this weekend, I would say,
[7629.26s -> 7638.02s]  so probably I might, we've done a lot of weird game cube stuff. I'll probably go back to the
[7638.02s -> 7647.54s]  X-Box, but also next week is the animal crossing and I'm playing animal crossing absolutely,
[7647.54s -> 7653.70s]  at least around somewhere around when it launches. So what I'll probably end up doing is we'll
[7653.70s -> 7661.18s]  probably do some X-Box stuff. Uh, like starting on like Wednesday and then we'll do like Wednesday,
[7661.18s -> 7666.38s]  Thursday, Friday, Saturday or something. And we'll do a couple of X-Box games and then I'm
[7666.38s -> 7674.33s]  going to play animal crossing for a couple of days, at least when it comes out. We'll see.
[7674.33s -> 7689.14s]  That's the plan. Thank you for the 15 bucks. Wait. Oh, I thought you said, I thought you said animal
[7689.14s -> 7696.14s]  crossing is not shipping until April. I was like, no way. What really smelly boy. Thanks for the
[7696.14s -> 7700.14s]  two 50. Thank you. So thank you for playing a big game hunter. Even if it wasn't for long,
[7700.14s -> 7704.62s]  it was hilarious watching you play. Just listening to the sounds and watching you chase the werewolves
[7705.42s -> 7710.22s]  Wolverines, uh, gave me such a nostalgia trip and have me laughing so hard. I've been sick
[7710.22s -> 7715.58s]  the past few days and very afraid because of it. Your streams are always a light in the darkness.
[7715.58s -> 7729.46s]  Love you, man. Keep up the good work and let's hope all this stuff passes soon. I agree. I remember
[7729.46s -> 7732.82s]  when I first started watching German with a super meat boy, let's play. I was pretty good at that
[7732.82s -> 7747.72s]  game. I did all the dark world levels and all the bandage girls level. Thanks smelly boy. Uh,
[7747.80s -> 7751.24s]  take care of yourself. Hopefully it's nothing serious, right? Hopefully it's not anything
[7751.24s -> 7763.64s]  to be concerned about. LM man. Thanks for the 500 bits. Jerma, you are king. Thank you. Uh, 10 Mario
[7763.64s -> 7768.44s]  or 10 Mari 10. Thanks for the 300 bits. I had a dream that you were streaming some game
[7769.00s -> 7772.52s]  when your cam accidentally turned on and you were standing fully nude in the shower.
[7773.24s -> 7777.00s]  Jack kept saying TOS and penis, but you didn't notice. I feel like this is an omen.
[7777.48s -> 7789.22s]  Um, I've had that dream twice, so trust me, I'm aware of it. Uh, you posted cringe bro. Thanks
[7789.22s -> 7793.06s]  to the 500 bits. You're losing a quick more piss jokes. I read it earlier, but I thought it was
[7793.06s -> 7803.48s]  kind of funny. Uh, you posted cringe bro gave another $25 and they say, Jerma, you're worried
[7803.48s -> 7811.64s]  about the Corona virus with you being a boomer cringe and needs to say cringe. Which one of us
[7811.64s -> 7831.98s]  is posting the cringe? Sure. It's me. Oof. Oof. No, it's me. It's me. Uh, thanks for the 25
[7831.98s -> 7838.23s]  fucking dollars in bits though, dude. Seriously. It's Luke can. Thanks for the $5. Jerma, are you
[7838.23s -> 7850.78s]  in a quarantine? No, I am not. Let's hope it doesn't get that far. I'm not, uh, future fashion
[7850.78s -> 7855.98s]  grow clown. Thanks for the $3 and 20 cents. Jerma, what's your opinion on mustard on hard boiled
[7855.98s -> 7863.51s]  eggs? Well, a lot of deviled eggs have mustard inside of the mixture, so I think that that's
[7863.51s -> 7871.03s]  all right. That's fine. That's good. It could be good. I don't know about directly on a hard boiled
[7871.03s -> 7880.22s]  egg, but part of the mixture of a deviled egg. Sure. I'd say so. Espada Escalada. Thanks to the
[7880.22s -> 7894.42s]  250. Mr. Bean is the bugleberry of the television comedy world. No way. Apollyon Abadon. Thanks to
[7894.42s -> 7898.50s]  the 500 bits. Can we talk for a second about how Bugleberry is the best character?
[7899.54s -> 7907.99s]  I hope you think that. I really do. I really do. And if you have been part of any of the pre-stream
[7907.99s -> 7919.74s]  chats over the last few days, you will know why. I really hope you do like him a lot. I hope so.
[7919.74s -> 7942.04s]  Okay. Boiky, thanks for the 500 bits. Hope your pain goes away soon, Jerma. Also, fuck the bean
[7942.04s -> 7946.12s]  team. What's wrong with you? How could you say something like that? He's a classic comedian.
[7946.84s -> 7953.21s]  I do too. It's getting to the point where this is actually starting to,
[7954.01s -> 7961.90s]  I went back to the doctor and I had more tests done and I have like my fucking rheumatoid factor
[7961.90s -> 7970.07s]  is high and trying some new stuff and this costochondritis might be, it might not just be
[7970.07s -> 7975.51s]  costochondritis. I might have like rheumatoid fucking arthritis or something. It's still,
[7975.51s -> 7979.83s]  we're just still on the fucking train and I want to get off, you know, I want to like get off the
[7979.83s -> 7987.98s]  damn train. So it's just almost, it's like, it's been like almost two fucking years of this shit.
[7988.70s -> 7991.42s]  I just want to know what the hell is wrong with me and just start treating the fucking thing.
[7996.30s -> 8001.37s]  I'm just being totally honest with you. You know, I'm not going to pretend or anything. Like this
[8001.37s -> 8010.44s]  is just me talking to you real. Like this is just me, but it just, whatever. Well, it just,
[8010.44s -> 8014.28s]  I'm going to keep going until it's figured out and then just treat it and try to get back to normal.
[8014.28s -> 8030.47s]  Oh, stop pretending. Stop, stop pretending. Unfortunately, funny streamer memes do not
[8031.11s -> 8038.41s]  work in the world of potential medical issues. Imagine like going to the doctor and he's just
[8038.41s -> 8042.97s]  like, oh, so what are your symptoms? Yeah. I still have like this kind of like spinal, like chest,
[8042.97s -> 8055.59s]  like core pain. Stop pretending. Okay. Oh, there he is. Jerva talks about the doctor and the doctor
[8055.59s -> 8065.80s]  has a funny voice. Put the turkey on your head. Here's the Jerva goes to the doctor and the doctor
[8065.80s -> 8072.33s]  goes, oh, what's wrong with you? Oh, I'm stupid. There's a laugh track with the turkey. Oh, it just
[8072.33s -> 8085.48s]  bumped into the wall. Anyways, uh, yeah, I just want to get it taken care of. And the problem is
[8085.48s -> 8091.96s]  like the medical, the medical like world just moves so slowly. It's like, okay, so here we're
[8091.96s -> 8099.08s]  going to do this testing. All right. See you in like two or three weeks. Like, can we just,
[8099.08s -> 8104.60s]  can I just come in fucking tomorrow? Like, can I just come in for the next eight straight days
[8104.60s -> 8109.08s]  and you just do everything you've ever wanted to do to me? Like everything that you could even
[8109.08s -> 8115.10s]  imagine. Just do it all. Like, oh, we'll see. Oh, we'll catch back up with you. Uh, in April.
[8115.98s -> 8126.81s]  But no, no, no. Can I, can I, can you just like do all this shit now? Like, well, we're going to
[8126.81s -> 8130.97s]  give you, we're going to do an MRI. Let's set the MRI up. Oh, this is a thing you're trying to get
[8130.97s -> 8134.89s]  figured out. Oh, we want to figure this out. Uh, so when are you available in, in, in four and a
[8134.89s -> 8147.16s]  half weeks? Uh, I guess on Tuesday, the fucking 12th. I just want to bang, bang. Let's go. Let's go.
[8147.48s -> 8155.94s]  Let's get it done. So like, well, it's a lot of hurry up and wait. And here's the thing. I also,
[8155.94s -> 8162.84s]  I kind of get it too though, because there's a lot of like processing and a lot of trying to,
[8163.48s -> 8169.48s]  I've had a bunch of shit done already and we're just bouncing around with these different ideas
[8169.48s -> 8173.80s]  of what could be fucking wrong with me. I did like a rheumatoid test and it's high. And it's like,
[8173.80s -> 8182.46s]  okay, well, what the fuck does that mean? Fringe healthcare, fail country. All right. Jay bum bum
[8182.46s -> 8202.14s]  7723. I remember you, but I don't want to have the, and this is the problem that I don't want to
[8202.14s -> 8208.78s]  have bleed into the live streams. I don't want to have this be a problem for me to bring into the
[8208.78s -> 8212.54s]  streams. I don't want it to affect the streams. I don't want to have it be a situation where I'm
[8212.54s -> 8217.78s]  just, this is something I'm complaining about a lot or every stream. I'm like, this is fucking
[8217.78s -> 8226.62s]  stupid. Fuck this. So I don't want it to be like that. And although this is an annoying problem,
[8227.10s -> 8232.78s]  it's not, it's not like debilitating to me. It's just there and it's annoying and I'll figure it
[8232.78s -> 8239.34s]  out. But I don't want it to create this like aura of just negativity around me on the stream
[8240.30s -> 8246.14s]  because I want to have fun. And like, and look 98 times out of a hundred, this is not a problem on
[8246.14s -> 8248.94s]  screen, but sometimes it comes up and it's just like, okay, what the, what do I do now?
[8249.50s -> 8263.46s]  Like what, what should I do now? Unfortunately. And I know that it's like, no, don't really like
[8263.46s -> 8265.86s]  a lot of you guys are saying like, don't worry about it. That's fine. Like we get it and
[8265.86s -> 8271.30s]  everything. And I really appreciate that. But remember I want to be here. Like I want to do
[8271.30s -> 8275.94s]  this. I want to be live. I want to hang. I want to like laugh and have a fucking good time. You
[8275.94s -> 8279.54s]  know what I mean? Like I don't want to be like, it's been three hours and like my back hurts. Bye.
[8282.57s -> 8294.17s]  So it's, you know, it's frustrating. I'll be honest with you. It is, but I don't want it to
[8294.17s -> 8298.81s]  be a thing that's because it's not really that in the grand scheme of things, it's not that big of
[8298.81s -> 8305.16s]  a deal because it eventually long-term, I'll probably have a solution for it. It's just kind
[8305.16s -> 8317.38s]  of short-term is annoying. There you go. Laying it out there, right? What a megalofucking maniac.
[8318.26s -> 8332.01s]  So we get, we're going to keep walking down the road until, uh, until I actually get the exact
[8332.01s -> 8338.60s]  thing that's really wrong. And that's pretty much it. I, I'm probably not going to address it too
[8338.60s -> 8343.40s]  much more on stream because I also don't want it to turn into a thing where it's like, oh, German
[8343.40s -> 8347.00s]  something's wrong with you. Something's wrong with German. Something's wrong with him. Oh man,
[8347.00s -> 8351.72s]  it's all right German. There's something wrong with you. You're okay. Well, don't worry. I don't
[8351.72s -> 8358.90s]  want it to turn into like a, there's something wrong with German. And, oh no, you know what I mean?
[8358.90s -> 8365.46s]  I don't want it to be like that. Something's always been wrong with you. Yeah, but I'm talking
[8365.46s -> 8384.06s]  about in a medical sense. There's always something wrong with you, dude. But anyways, that's pretty
[8384.06s -> 8392.25s]  much it. I just want to talk to you guys and be realistic and real with you, you know? Sometimes.
[8392.25s -> 8398.47s]  It's all fun and games until somebody wears a fucking boomer brace. You know what I'm saying?
[8399.35s -> 8403.91s]  Hey Mitchell, thanks for the 500 bits. Odama more like awesome streamer providing years of
[8403.91s -> 8421.24s]  priceless content. Clean Your Room title is just so fucking wrong. Clean Your Room playing Elevates
[8421.24s -> 8431.85s]  and Mr. Bean is the thumbnail eating raw turkey. It's all fun and games until somebody puts on a
[8431.85s -> 8442.30s]  turkey head video. Mr. Bean headcrab edit. Oh, come on. Don't, I gotta watch this.
[8462.76s -> 8468.36s]  The problem with the mayor is that, well, how can I put this kindly? He's a total idiot.
[8471.80s -> 8480.79s]  He needs his leadership, vision, vision, petition.
[8481.75s -> 8490.74s]  That's quick. That's, that you gotta, you have to remember, keep in mind,
[8492.23s -> 8495.51s]  you gotta render this shit. That, it takes a little bit to render.
[8496.31s -> 8509.53s]  You have to make this, render it, and upload it. Damn, that's fucking pretty good. All right,
[8509.53s -> 8527.29s]  let's keep going with the, with the bits. We have a little bit more. Where'd it go? We had, that was
[8527.29s -> 8535.94s]  Mitchell. Thank you for the $5 Mitchell and the video. Hey Lil Din Osor, thanks for the 500 bits.
[8535.94s -> 8539.70s]  Hey Jerma, today's my fourth anniversary with my boyfriend and we celebrate it by watching you.
[8540.50s -> 8543.54s]  We love and appreciate you. Hope all your health stuff gets better soon. Well, I appreciate that.
[8543.54s -> 8554.12s]  Thank you and happy anniversary. Four years. That's, that's really good. Thanks for the five,
[8554.12s -> 8566.14s]  that five ducks, five bucks. And I can hear myself talking because this thing is plugged in and it's
[8566.14s -> 8574.79s]  speech jamming me. So let me just turn that off. Here we go. That's better. Yeah, I can hear myself
[8574.79s -> 8583.72s]  talking to my own ears. Do a speech jammer stream. That wouldn't last very long. I'd throw up.
[8583.72s -> 8593.59s]  I could try it. I could try it for fun for like maybe half an hour or something at the end of
[8593.59s -> 8600.74s]  a stream. But yeah, happy anniversary. Thanks for the $5. Snoozing compter, thanks for the 250. Hey
[8600.74s -> 8604.90s]  Jerma, long time no bits. Please don't tell me Elevitz is going to get the God Hand treatment.
[8604.90s -> 8610.74s]  We played the beginning as part of a shit storm crack stream and forget about it forever. No,
[8610.74s -> 8615.86s]  it was just, it was kind of the catalyst to my pain. It was the way it was. I had to hold the
[8615.86s -> 8623.61s]  Wii mode and move it around and just the, I don't know, something about it. By the way, the director
[8623.61s -> 8629.35s]  that made Beautiful Joe also made God Hand. I knew you were going to talk about God Hand at
[8629.35s -> 8641.14s]  some point. Put it on the list. Jeremy, Jeremy, put it on the list, Albertson. Jeremy, push every
[8641.14s -> 8656.17s]  new stream week a day and put it on the list, Albertson985. Play Boom Blocks. I have it. It is
[8656.17s -> 8664.55s]  there. It's behind me. I will play God Hand. I will play God Hand. I will. It's not today.
[8665.27s -> 8672.33s]  Not today. Not tomorrow. Also, my girlfriend recently woke me up in the middle of the night
[8672.33s -> 8678.17s]  and told me not only is she a germaphobe, but also a germaphobe, she's still jealous.
[8680.89s -> 8683.61s]  Take care of your old man body. Wait, let me read this again.
[8685.05s -> 8690.57s]  Told me not only is she a germaphobe, but also a germaphobe, but she's still jealous.
[8691.21s -> 8698.55s]  And then a ton of laughing. She's jealous of you. She's scared of you. She's scared of you.
[8699.11s -> 8705.56s]  Did I finish Super Mario Sunshine? I did. I did. I got to beat the game and I got,
[8706.20s -> 8716.09s]  what, 71, 72 stars or something? Sticks Renegade, thanks for the 250. I hope this virus doesn't get
[8716.09s -> 8720.97s]  to me. If you remember, I take immunosuppressants for Crohn's. There's one case in my city and
[8720.97s -> 8738.52s]  20 cases in Rhode Island. Yeah, that's... Just be careful. Just be careful. Stay safe. Yeah.
[8739.48s -> 8753.35s]  Just try to be healthy. Try to be aware. That's all you can do. Dark Soul, thanks for the 250.
[8753.35s -> 8759.03s]  Here's Drink Bits. Johnny Blue tastes like cigars and assholes. Shout out to my boy,
[8759.03s -> 8764.31s]  Nier. Call of Fury War Zone good. Me drunk. Thank you, cutie.
[8768.65s -> 8779.88s]  I'm sorry that, I'm sorry that you have an opinion that is not correct. I'm sorry that you feel
[8781.18s -> 8799.24s]  wrongly about something. This tastes like cigars and asshole. Well, do you even... Okay,
[8799.24s -> 8806.86s]  do you like whiskey? Do you like whiskey? Because if you don't like whiskey, then don't take my
[8806.86s -> 8815.46s]  recommendations for whiskey, right? That's like, dude, I hate hot sauce. I hate it. I think it's
[8815.46s -> 8820.10s]  disgusting. Yeah, you should try Tabasco sauce. Oh, should I? Let me try that. I hate hot sauce.
[8820.10s -> 8825.37s]  Let me try it. Oh, this tastes like fucking assholes. He likes whiskey. He likes good
[8825.37s -> 8840.81s]  whiskey. Johnny Walker Blue is good. It's very, very smooth. It's light. It's whatever. Maybe
[8840.81s -> 8848.09s]  you should try poo wine. Oh, fuck. Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't do this to me.
[8849.99s -> 8857.03s]  That was the fucking craziest thing, man. This is a weird stream. What a fucked up stream.
[8858.66s -> 8865.05s]  The poo wine thing was so ridiculous and it fucked me up for life. I didn't think I was
[8865.05s -> 8870.95s]  ever going to do a stream that was going to fuck me up for life. And here I am, completely corrected.
[8871.59s -> 8882.98s]  And it was ridiculous. It was exactly the way that it would look. It was... That person that
[8882.98s -> 8895.21s]  said that originally, holy shit, you have messed me up permanently. Hey, Machine Nation, thanks for
[8895.21s -> 8899.13s]  the three dollars. Hey, Jerm, I just wanted to point out something. When you played Asura's Wrath,
[8899.13s -> 8903.53s]  you mentioned it was highly recommended, and I found it was mentioned nine times in the
[8903.53s -> 8908.65s]  recommendation channel. Today, you played Monster Lab, which you also mentioned you got from the
[8908.65s -> 8914.17s]  recommendations, and that was only mentioned once. Meanwhile, the game Fury has been recommended 12
[8914.17s -> 8918.97s]  times since December 2018. It's not been played at all. Well, that's not accurate. Just want to
[8918.97s -> 8923.85s]  put that out there. Well, you've got to get your facts right. I streamed Fury already, a whole stream.
[8924.81s -> 8931.19s]  Your facts are incorrect. Make sure you come in here with real facts, because I streamed the
[8931.19s -> 8942.20s]  video game Fury already when it came out. I got like 50, 60 percent of the way through the game.
[8947.93s -> 8956.14s]  So, I mean, if you're going to come after the king, what's that line? If you're going to come
[8956.14s -> 8969.46s]  after the king, make sure you bring sweets and give them to me. Yeah, that's it. That's the line.
[8971.82s -> 8976.62s]  By the way, just want to make this really clear. Just because somebody writes something in the
[8976.62s -> 8981.26s]  recommended channel, even if it's a hundred times, doesn't mean I will ever play it.
[8982.30s -> 8986.76s]  The reason why I played Monster Lab is because it was recommended, and I looked at it and I said,
[8986.76s -> 8991.66s]  hey, this looks like it could be interesting. Everyone's a big fan of Monster Rancher.
[8992.38s -> 8999.54s]  It's like a back and forth. You have a monster that you grow and level up, and it turns out when it
[8999.54s -> 9013.99s]  was actually played, it wasn't really that, like, I wasn't into it, and it had tracing in it. So,
[9013.99s -> 9025.46s]  I wasn't going to play it. Play purple plays. But the recommended channel is not about how
[9025.46s -> 9029.46s]  many people recommend something. It's about, do I think it's interesting enough for me to want to
[9029.46s -> 9038.06s]  stream it? Like, do I want to play it? I mean, that's, it's a recommendation. It's not a demand,
[9039.74s -> 9055.29s]  right? But to answer your question, I've already streamed Fury. I did. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[9055.29s -> 9062.41s]  I did. When? When the game, like, came out. I'm going to look this up. We're going to stop at
[9062.41s -> 9071.90s]  Germa Fury. Is it archived? I think it might be. Maybe it's one of those streams that never got
[9071.90s -> 9080.82s]  archived. No, it's not. There's not even a single clip of me playing this game, huh?
[9092.87s -> 9099.19s]  I love Fury. I had no idea he streamed it. If you Google Germa Fury, this is the second result,
[9099.19s -> 9105.66s]  and it is the Reddit thread asking if I've ever streamed Fury. There's no evidence that it was
[9105.66s -> 9116.94s]  ever streamed. That's so funny. No, I did. I did. I swear to God. People were here. I didn't imagine
[9116.94s -> 9129.88s]  this. I've actually, I swear. You can't prove it. You did. Yes, I did. It's a lost episode.
[9132.54s -> 9141.19s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, what's this? What's this? Wait, wait, wait, wait. We got a clip.
[9141.19s -> 9156.60s]  Somebody has a clip. Get that back in there. This is me playing Fury, but it's me changing games.
[9159.38s -> 9175.14s]  Get in there. What the fuck is this? Come on. There we go. There we go. I was trying to stay
[9175.14s -> 9183.48s]  with you. I had no idea. I was your only hope. I told you. You had brought this upon yourself,
[9183.48s -> 9189.56s]  stranger. It's real. I told you it was real. Tactical visor activated.
[9189.56s -> 9196.62s]  What the fuck am I doing? Oh shit. Tactical visor activated.
[9198.30s -> 9202.86s]  Oh, it's Mercy and Soldier 76 combined. Whoa, new hero announced.
[9204.12s -> 9209.24s]  All right. No, no, no, no, no, no. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Don't you dare minus two
[9209.24s -> 9215.32s]  that. That was an incredibly relevant fucking joke because Overwatch was in beta and it was
[9215.32s -> 9222.30s]  the biggest fucking thing in the world. Okay. Sorry. Four years ago, I made a jokey reference
[9222.30s -> 9229.00s]  to one of the biggest video game releases in 10 years. It was four years ago. I didn't just say
[9229.00s -> 9242.95s]  that last weekend. We used to stream Overwatch and then I just didn't think it was fun anymore.
[9243.51s -> 9254.15s]  Dude, cringe ages like fine wine. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here.
[9254.95s -> 9261.16s]  Get out of here. All right. I'll see you guys. Looking into the credits.
[9261.96s -> 9267.27s]  Sorry for the four hour stream. Thankfully, it wasn't like a two hour stream because it
[9267.27s -> 9275.85s]  really could have been. Could have been. Thanks for watching regardless. We'll see you tomorrow.
[9276.49s -> 9283.94s]  I'm going to do the microphone video game and see if we can get three times. Third time's a charm.
[9284.50s -> 9290.39s]  It's either third time's a charm or strike three you're out because each microphone video game
[9290.39s -> 9296.20s]  we've played has been some of my favorite times on stream. Like I've had a lot of fun with the
[9296.20s -> 9301.48s]  microphone games. This could be strike three you're out or it could be third time's a charm.
[9302.73s -> 9309.29s]  I know. But I'll see you tomorrow. Here come the credits. We'll do the last couple of bits.
[9310.09s -> 9316.20s]  As always, thanks for your subs. This channel sees a lot of money like I say frequently.
[9316.92s -> 9333.51s]  Thank you everybody. Really appreciate it. We will finish the bits. Here's only a couple left.
[9334.23s -> 9352.62s]  Hey, thanks off futz for the 500 bits. The music is off. Off futz says, hi,
[9352.62s -> 9356.06s]  Jerma. I hope you're having a good day. Please read the following before you read it out loud.
[9356.06s -> 9370.84s]  Oh, okay. Temperature does influence joint pain. It's the barometric pressure. I have
[9370.84s -> 9375.64s]  rheumatoid arthritis and any major change in temperature really messes me up. Cold,
[9375.64s -> 9381.08s]  rainy, humid weather makes my joints, tendons, muscles tight while hot weather ups pain.
[9381.72s -> 9384.76s]  That's just me and I'm obviously not your doctor but hope this information helps you find some
[9384.76s -> 9391.93s]  answers. Because Vegas is really, really dry and I mean obviously it's been cold recently because
[9391.93s -> 9403.13s]  it's been the winter time. But when hot weather ups pain, I don't know. Let me, this is very,
[9403.13s -> 9406.65s]  very good information and I will take it absolutely. But let me get that like a
[9406.65s -> 9412.92s]  confirmation that that's what's really going on. Because that's another thing too with obviously
[9412.92s -> 9417.48s]  me talking about some of this stuff on stream. I don't want to come here with inaccurate
[9417.48s -> 9423.16s]  information and stuff that might not be true. Like, oh guys, I have rheumatoid arthritis. Like,
[9423.16s -> 9427.48s]  I don't. Like, I don't, that's not confirmed. I have this. I don't want to have you guys,
[9427.48s -> 9433.61s]  I don't want to talk about something that I have when I might not even have it. You know,
[9433.61s -> 9437.85s]  I want to be certain and not just like throw out nonsense that it could be not even true.
[9443.77s -> 9451.99s]  As much as I talk about it, I don't really want to give you diagnostic stuff. Because I've done
[9451.99s -> 9457.50s]  that in the past before and I don't, I just don't really want to do that anymore. I'd like to just
[9457.50s -> 9461.90s]  keep it just private until I have a certain answer. But on the other side of that coin,
[9461.90s -> 9465.42s]  it's like hard to not, because if I'm having like a problem and I have to like stop a stream
[9465.42s -> 9471.58s]  or something, it's like, well, why are you stopping the stream? It's like, I have this problem and then
[9471.58s -> 9475.26s]  I have to talk about it. And you know what I'm saying? It's like a, just try to balance it out
[9475.26s -> 9490.94s]  a little bit. That's pretty much it. Let's say health problems. Yeah. And like when I wear,
[9490.94s -> 9494.86s]  that's like, when I wear like the brace, it's like, I know we, I know a lot of people are
[9494.86s -> 9498.46s]  fucking around and I do, I think it's funny. I do think it's funny. So you're not like hurting
[9498.46s -> 9502.62s]  my feelings when it's like, he's got overalls on. Like, why does he have a backpack on? Like I,
[9502.62s -> 9507.58s]  that's humorous. It's funny to me. It is. But there are people that actually come in and they're like,
[9507.58s -> 9515.53s]  why is he wearing that? Like, is he, was it for? It's like, well, it's his backpack, right? That's
[9515.53s -> 9523.58s]  that's it. So, you know, it's, I'm trying to find like a healthy balance as to what it even is.
[9527.75s -> 9534.86s]  But goo berry juice. Thanks for the 250. Hey, cool. I love monster lab. So glad you're playing the
[9534.86s -> 9541.82s]  oops. Nevermind. Hey, how was rabbits? I love that game itself. Oh, whoops. Scammed. Hey,
[9541.82s -> 9547.10s]  well Cabela 2005 was the first game I ever played. Oh, he hates it. Whoa. Okay. I love
[9547.10s -> 9550.94s]  alibis. That might be fun. Oh, he just watching Mr. Bean now.
[9550.94s -> 9559.83s]  Oh, it's so true. It hurts.
[9563.51s -> 9570.31s]  It's perfect. What a perfect way to end this stream. That's perfect. Oh, I love that guy.
[9570.31s -> 9584.23s]  Whoops. Scammed. God damn. It's all good though. Whatever. It's all good. Hey, Bimmy. Thanks Bimmy
[9584.23s -> 9591.99s]  for the three dollars, Bimmy. And finally we had three dollars from Ozals, which will take us to
[9591.99s -> 9598.31s]  the end of the stream. Thank you Ozals for the three bucks. It's a relevant video. There's a
[9598.31s -> 9616.52s]  relevant video here. Turn that poop into wine. Turn that poop into wine. Turn that poop into wine.
[9616.60s -> 9623.80s]  Turn that poop into wine. On the second coming of Jesus Christ, prove it.
[9624.68s -> 9635.13s]  Take a poop in front of us. What's that even supposed to mean? Oh, that's Eric Andre's
[9635.13s -> 9643.61s]  is fucking hilarious. You should watch more Eric Andre. Well, I can't watch more Eric Andre
[9643.61s -> 9650.01s]  because I've seen all Eric Andre. I've seen it all. All of his show, all of his extended
[9650.09s -> 9668.47s]  New Year's Eve celebrations. I've seen them all. He's very, very, very funny. Are you going to see
[9668.47s -> 9681.45s]  the movie? I hope so. Oh, I hope so. I better. They're about Raid, Raid, Raid Joel, Raid Joel,
[9681.45s -> 9698.60s]  Raid, Raid Joel. What's Joel doing right now? What's he up to? Grand Theft Auto 3. What the
[9698.60s -> 9707.69s]  heck? Grand Theft Auto 3. Somebody did an uptime in this stream and I thought it said 20 hours.
[9708.65s -> 9714.39s]  Like, holy shit, it's been going for a long fucking time. So I want everybody to remember that.
[9717.75s -> 9721.51s]  You know, what's better than this? Besides everything, a burger with a crispy wheel of
[9721.51s -> 9725.91s]  cheese on it. Is it weird that I, I, this is an ad, but I wasn't looking and I thought that was
[9725.91s -> 9732.55s]  Joel doing like a voice for a second. I was like, wait, this is a, no, it's a Carl's Jr. ad.
[9733.51s -> 9746.38s]  All right. I'll see, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a good night. Again, sorry for the ending
[9746.38s -> 9753.26s]  of the stream, but you know, you gotta do what you gotta do. See you guys tomorrow. We'll do
[9753.26s -> 9785.93s]  it again tomorrow. Good night. Take care. Have a good one.
