[0.44s -> 13.08s]  Hey, how's everybody doing? Hopefully pretty good. I'm just hanging out here.
[14.04s -> 24.49s]  Everybody, you have 20 minutes to live. Don't worry, I'm gonna be just fine.
[25.05s -> 48.60s]  Let me just change this over. Just tweeted it. It's pre-recorded, it's not. Look, I'm getting
[48.60s -> 57.19s]  ready here. I'm trying as hard as I can to get ready. These are resistant gloves. I've got,
[57.19s -> 68.04s]  I've got lots of padding. I've got lots of padding. I'm ready for a fucking meteor to hit.
[68.04s -> 91.24s]  Get the other one on. All right, we're good. But not yet. Pocky pads too. I think these are for
[91.24s -> 107.48s]  children because I don't think I've got the correct one that were for adults. I think it
[107.48s -> 116.78s]  actually says in the back that this is for people in the eighth grade. It's all right,
[116.78s -> 124.92s]  it's okay. It's just Velcro. I could have taken, all right, it does fit. It is for
[124.92s -> 134.52s]  an adult because I have the strap still on. Padding breached. Don't say that. So you got,
[134.52s -> 139.42s]  okay, so let me make sure I get this correct. Let me stand up. This is like, this is for a
[139.42s -> 145.88s]  meteor, right? Resistant gloves. I mean, this is, on the package it said it was for gardening.
[146.87s -> 150.87s]  But I mean, there could be some acid that I could come into contact with that I won't be
[150.87s -> 171.10s]  touching here. I got my padding. Should get this on too. Audio is out of sync. How so?
[171.10s -> 181.99s]  Is it? It shouldn't be. Hello, hello, it's out of sync. This is my helmet to protect me from any
[182.89s -> 204.54s]  face related injuries. I feel like a Lego guy. No, hold on. I gotta like cover the logos.
[205.34s -> 326.14s]  I didn't cover the logos. Just stay right there. Sorry, I just had to find these. I had
[326.14s -> 336.44s]  to find the scissors because this tape is wicked fucked up. It's stuck together. You see?
[337.16s -> 352.10s]  Why is it stuck together? It just give me the roles. Like, look at this. This is not even a joke.
[352.10s -> 361.70s]  That works. No, it doesn't. Look at this. Why would you duct tape together? Duct tape.
[362.34s -> 376.98s]  Who thought of this idea? All right. Okay. There we go.
[384.70s -> 444.94s]  No, it's gonna shoot back in. As you can see, I put foam padding all over my room to be
[444.94s -> 462.46s]  able to participate in. I got foam in the corner. See? I foam padded my room.
[462.54s -> 476.60s]  Nice feet, idiot. This is a stressful day for me. Oh, my feet are protected. That makes perfect
[476.60s -> 486.15s]  sense as to why you would just say that. Exposed feet. I didn't think that far ahead. I thought
[486.15s -> 503.21s]  about my chest. What time is it? I got, I got 13 minutes. Ah, god damn it. I slept in late
[504.14s -> 510.81s]  because the fucking 12 hour stream last night. Get the helmet. I will. I will. I'm gonna get
[510.81s -> 529.24s]  the helmet on, but I don't, I, it's got like a big logo on it. All right. Here we go. Beer,
[529.24s -> 534.97s]  me, username. Thanks for the 10 community subs. Let's just get this logo covered.
[535.53s -> 541.22s]  Thank you for the 10 community subs. Don't worry. We're gonna make it. We're gonna make it.
[541.22s -> 546.81s]  There we go. I just don't want anyone to see. I don't want company names and all that.
[546.81s -> 558.07s]  I don't want anyone to know what company name that is. You know, company names gotta get
[558.07s -> 602.39s]  covered. There we go. Now I can put this on. See? We're good. I feel like I'm about to go
[602.39s -> 609.96s]  get a fucking massage. I hate this. See, I could like, I could like smash my head into something.
[610.52s -> 625.85s]  The straps gonna choke you. Don't say something like that. Uh oh. No variables. No variables
[625.85s -> 660.50s]  allowed. None. Okay. Okay. Eye protection. Don't touch anything. They're not gonna put,
[660.50s -> 666.49s]  this hurts. How do people wear these? I would rather dodge the fucking shot of glass
[666.49s -> 674.66s]  that's gonna come through. No, I'll be all right. Cause now, okay, if like the ceiling
[674.66s -> 683.53s]  caves in, it's gonna hit me right in the crown of the head. This only protects my cheekbones
[683.53s -> 703.78s]  and my forehead. I got an exposed neck. Don't worry. I got like a plan. I don't have a plan.
[704.34s -> 718.02s]  I'm gonna have to like lie down. I'm gonna lie down over there. How's it back look? Pillows.
[718.58s -> 764.73s]  Hold on. Fucking idiot. One, two, three. I shouldn't have got the mail like this.
[765.69s -> 804.46s]  It's not the right. I got it. Hold on. I feel like this is a doctor from like the 1600s.
[805.02s -> 830.46s]  All right. That's good. All right. I just look, I look like a nun. Crown of the head is covered.
[830.46s -> 841.77s]  Head. Shoulders. Acid resistant gloves. What time is it? I got 10 minutes. Not even. You're
[841.77s -> 847.90s]  gonna die from overheating. It's, it's very cold outside right now. Don't worry. I've had
[847.90s -> 854.12s]  plenty of water. Protect my neck. I'm just gonna go like that. Don't worry. And I gotta
[854.12s -> 865.26s]  lie down. I gotta like lie the fuck down somewhere. I'm gonna have like red cheeks.
[865.98s -> 874.55s]  What if you need to pee? That's, it's just gonna happen. You know, it's just gonna happen.
[875.37s -> 882.14s]  Look, I have only 10 minutes until it's over. What about getting hit by a broom?
[884.46s -> 890.17s]  I'll grab it with my heat resistant hands. He's gotta pee. I don't have to pee right
[890.17s -> 898.73s]  now. I'm just fine. Why would I catch fire? I am completely protected from the elements.
[899.37s -> 913.37s]  Rain. Ceiling cave-in. Explosion. Cross check. You know what I mean? Bar soap falling down.
[914.89s -> 935.56s]  Acid. Oh, I got some, hold on. Shrists. Shrids. Shins. Wrists. I'm ready. And I'm gonna keep
[935.56s -> 940.44s]  my, I, but you don't see down here as I have survived two big foot cases that I'm sticking
[940.44s -> 952.84s]  them in right now. We got, all right. I need to relax. What do you think? Where's
[952.84s -> 960.34s]  a good spot? I'm thinking right here. It's out of the way again. It's in a variable.
[960.34s -> 973.93s]  Get the variables out of the way. Check the closet. Remember, always go fucking acid gloves first.
[994.98s -> 1002.78s]  We're good. All right. Any like paint that could fall on me.
[1006.62s -> 1021.35s]  I'm ready. We got like four minutes. God damn it, man. Getting fucking nervous now.
[1024.74s -> 1031.99s]  Feet. Feet. I told you I got, I got a thing to put my feet into in case something happens.
[1032.63s -> 1043.37s]  I was gonna stick them in here. Look, see? We're good. Seal the room. Fucked gas.
[1044.09s -> 1050.97s]  Toxic gas is gonna. I don't have enough time for this. I gotta get, I gotta go lie down.
[1052.09s -> 1058.79s]  No, I'm gonna lose my security deposit. I'm gonna, I'll be all right.
[1059.43s -> 1073.61s]  The door moved. The door didn't move. We're fine. All right. Okay. I gotta get,
[1073.61s -> 1082.52s]  I gotta get in the position. Position, position, position, position. Which position?
[1083.53s -> 1094.71s]  And we're gonna have on like some very easy relaxing music. Relaxing music. Relaxing sleep
[1094.71s -> 1107.56s]  music. This is as good. Can I even hear it? Don't put anything in your ear. That's good.
[1109.66s -> 1122.06s]  Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go. Here we go. Okay. Three minutes. Get out of the way. Right here.
[1122.06s -> 1150.98s]  I'm gonna lie, just lie down. Okay. Right here. Protect acid hands. We good? Oh shit,
[1151.78s -> 1309.62s]  what time is it? All right. All right. Nobody talk. I was relaxing. It was very relaxing. No.
[1310.50s -> 1320.22s]  Wait, what? How do I get in? How do I get back inside? You gotta be kidding me.
[1320.22s -> 1343.38s]  Can you see me? Can anybody see me? Oh, come on. This is not even possible.
[1344.10s -> 1351.69s]  I had the headgear on. I had on, I got the special belt. I duct taped the house.
[1352.49s -> 1372.68s]  Can I click? I can't interact with any of this shit. Fuck.
[1379.19s -> 1409.50s]  Hey. Hey, wake up. Oh. Maybe I saw this in a movie once. This is my uniform that I wear when I'm a
[1409.50s -> 1416.30s]  ghost. The same shit that I had on is just no fucking fat suit. All right. Hold on a minute.
[1416.30s -> 1421.48s]  I saw Freaky Friday with Lindsay Lohan and I remember they did the same thing.
[1422.04s -> 1429.50s]  I just, I gotta jump in and think about all the fucking memories that I've ever had.
[1429.50s -> 1434.60s]  Right? Every memory I've ever had, I gotta make them all come out in one second. Here we go.
[1435.24s -> 1489.19s]  Baby. Well, it was a pretty, it was pretty good, I guess. Just make sure to, uh, anytime that you...
[1557.61s -> 1621.22s]  It's great. I was in eighth grade. 440, 448. 448? I just put my head down. Was it four...
[1621.22s -> 1636.39s]  I was freaking out. Wait, are we still... Is that real? Four... I can't really see.
[1638.06s -> 1652.07s]  That doesn't make any sense. Can we confirm this is not a fucked up clock?
[1652.07s -> 1671.54s]  449. I just put my head down. I just, I literally... Holy shit. Well, there we are.
[1671.54s -> 1688.95s]  I just put my head down for a second. Strange. Um, okay. I did it. I made it.
[1692.01s -> 1700.78s]  Thanos' head. Yeah, it was easy. Watch out what happens on January 23rd. You're gonna be in
[1700.78s -> 1708.58s]  trouble. Yeah. All this for no fucking reason. Unbelievable. I spent through, I go through all
[1708.58s -> 1721.62s]  the trouble. Turn that music off. We don't even need it. He's behind you. I was, I panicked. I
[1721.62s -> 1727.90s]  was freaking out for nothing. Sometimes I'll let you guys get to me, you know? Sometimes you guys
[1727.90s -> 1742.52s]  come up with these fucking elaborate stories. How did this get on the ground? I may move my
[1742.52s -> 1748.94s]  chair back over here. I was pushed over. What is the after... What are you talking about?
[1749.50s -> 1758.33s]  I literally laid down right there. I blinked and I wanted to check the time. And that's
[1758.33s -> 1762.97s]  it. Like, I must have, maybe, I don't know. Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I was sitting here
[1763.53s -> 1779.26s]  and didn't realize it was like 445. Nice tattoos. Where? 7,000. Holy shit. There's
[1779.26s -> 1793.00s]  7,000 people here watching. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you all. So we're gonna, we're
[1793.00s -> 1797.37s]  gonna transition here. We're gonna, uh, I really thought this was only gonna be like
[1797.37s -> 1806.50s]  a 30 or 40 minute stream anyways, but I mean, we're gonna transition. What happened
[1806.50s -> 1826.92s]  in the eighth grade? What do you mean eighth grade? Finished Lifeline. I could hook up
[1826.92s -> 1835.19s]  Lifeline and we'd give it another go. You sneezed in the eighth... When did I sneeze?
[1836.15s -> 1840.25s]  All right, I gotta get out of this. Because I was in it for, what a fucking waste. I was
[1840.25s -> 1844.33s]  in it for no reason. I'll be back. I, let me get out of this and like fucking
[1844.33s -> 1865.77s]  shake my hair. I'll be right back. We're gonna play Lifeline. What do you mean joke
[1865.77s -> 1877.18s]  incoming? No, I'm just, I'm taking off all this, like, fat suit padding. I just
[1877.18s -> 1879.90s]  don't want the camera on me. Hold on. I'll be back. I, I, give me, I got,
[1879.90s -> 1881.98s]  you're gonna have to give me, like, at least a few minutes here.
