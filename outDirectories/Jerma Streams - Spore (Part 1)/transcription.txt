[0.76s -> 10.80s]  Oh shit, people were betting on that. I didn't even see it. I didn't even know. I- I didn't even know. I had no idea.
[10.80s -> 19.94s]  Two minutes late. Sorry, those of you that thought it was gonna happen a minute and a half ago.
[19.94s -> 29.69s]  You asshole. Look, you- I- I didn't- Look, I don't know you guys are betting on this stuff.
[29.69s -> 33.69s]  You guys can't bet on whether or not I'm gonna take a bath today.
[33.69s -> 39.69s]  And if I decide, unbeknownst to you guys betting, that I don't take a bath.
[39.69s -> 45.57s]  And half of you guys are watching like the Truman Show monitor going like, he didn't take a fucking bath today.
[45.57s -> 57.49s]  Fuck him. I'm just sitting- I'm- I don't know. You're looking- I know you have cameras in my house. What are you talking about?
[57.49s -> 67.83s]  Anyways. Hi guys. 3.3 million.
[67.83s -> 76.55s]  Wait, will Jerma be live in 24 minutes at exact- at 430 p- No. Oh, right, okay.
[76.55s -> 84.44s]  So today, we are going to do something that I've put off for a long time.
[84.44s -> 89.44s]  We're gonna play a game that I tried to stream like two years ago, three years ago.
[89.44s -> 92.44s]  And it wouldn't work and it was all messed up and I had a lot of trouble streaming it.
[92.44s -> 104.15s]  But we're back. That game is Spore. And you're probably wondering, why are you playing Spore, Jerma?
[104.15s -> 111.52s]  I thought you told me two days ago that you were gonna play Paper Mario, Thousand Year Door.
[111.52s -> 119.14s]  Well, you would be completely correct. I said, hey yeah, that sounds- let's do that next- let's do that next stream.
[119.14s -> 125.45s]  So, I, uh, I went through the process of looking into Thousand Year Door.
[125.45s -> 135.47s]  Didn't realize the game was incredibly rare. I thought it was gonna be as easy as just like going and getting it.
[135.47s -> 141.44s]  It's a rare ass game. And all of you saying, emulate it, emulate it.
[141.44s -> 147.44s]  You want me to openly emulate a first party Nintendo game and tell you I'm doing it on stream?
[147.44s -> 153.75s]  You're trying to get me fucking thrown in prison?
[153.75s -> 160.58s]  There's one thing that Nintendo hates more than anything. It's emulating.
[160.58s -> 168.58s]  Especially if somebody is actively there with like an audience of people going, yeah, I emulated this shit.
[168.58s -> 177.94s]  What do I care? A slip will go under my door. It'll have like a bunch of stamps on it.
[177.94s -> 182.20s]  It'll be from Nintendo themselves.
[182.20s -> 193.22s]  No, I ain't emulating a first party Nintendo game. I'll find a way to stream it legally.
[193.22s -> 199.22s]  Uh-uh. I ain't fucking with that. I ain't fucking with Nintendo. They're ruthless if they find out.
[199.22s -> 212.94s]  Pepehands, he lied to us.
[212.94s -> 217.94s]  So, I said, you know what? Why don't we play a game that a lot of people have wanted to see for a long time?
[217.94s -> 224.44s]  We're gonna play Spore. And we'll probably do Spore for the next- I don't know, depending how good it is.
[224.44s -> 228.81s]  I forget nostalgia is kicking in. I remember it being kind of fun.
[228.81s -> 232.43s]  But maybe we'll do this for the next couple of days. We'll see.
[235.34s -> 239.34s]  Just buy it on Amazon? Well, yeah, but buying it on Amazon is easy.
[239.34s -> 251.81s]  The problem is that a lot of the shipping dates are not till February.
[251.81s -> 259.63s]  What about the flashing? Yes, okay, I think I have fixed the flashing.
[259.63s -> 261.63s]  That's since two days.
[261.63s -> 264.63s]  I didn't say February 1st. I said February. That does not- okay.
[264.63s -> 268.63s]  Some of you guys are way too literal with all information.
[268.63s -> 273.63s]  If I say the word February, that doesn't mean February 1st at 1201 AM.
[273.63s -> 283.33s]  That's not what that means. It could mean, like, February 8th, February 15th, February 6th, February 20th.
[283.33s -> 286.46s]  And some of them are expensive.
[286.46s -> 296.41s]  And I will pay $250 for Gotcha Force, but I will not pay $250 to make sure I get a thousand-year door here.
[296.41s -> 311.44s]  Like, in four days. No. Cheap-ass motherfucker.
[311.44s -> 314.44s]  I'm not even a cheap-ass motherfucker.
[314.44s -> 322.63s]  Chat is deranged.
[322.63s -> 326.63s]  I knew this was going to happen when I looked it up and I was like, oh shit, this is, like, kind of a rare game.
[326.63s -> 328.63s]  I've got to figure out how to do this.
[328.63s -> 335.92s]  I'm going to get it. I'm going to get- look, I might even do- I might even get one of the ones that gets here early.
[335.92s -> 337.92s]  But nothing's ever guaranteed to get here early.
[337.92s -> 350.04s]  Somebody- no, I'm not even going to read that.
[350.04s -> 353.73s]  Maybe you shouldn't plan things only one day in advance.
[353.73s -> 358.31s]  That's how I operate. That's how I operate, man.
[358.31s -> 363.77s]  This is something that a lot of the new viewers probably don't understand.
[363.77s -> 370.94s]  So there are, like, huge projects that are, like, months if not years in the making that you will see on this channel.
[370.94s -> 377.38s]  Everything else is planned 12 hours before a stream turns on.
[377.38s -> 385.87s]  That's just the way it is. That's just how it is here.
[385.87s -> 392.82s]  And sometimes it's, like, 30 minutes before a stream turns on.
[392.82s -> 400.41s]  I go, hmm, fucking what's happening today? Um, leaf blower simulator?
[400.41s -> 407.83s]  That sounds like fun.
[408.83s -> 411.83s]  And then you ask chat. Yeah, I'm like, chat, what do you think?
[411.83s -> 417.21s]  What about Pikmin? You know what?
[417.21s -> 420.21s]  Because- okay, listen to me.
[420.21s -> 427.21s]  Because Paper Mario and the thousand-year-old door has been postponed until somewhere in the middle of February,
[427.21s -> 434.21s]  I'm going to use my IOU card here and we're going to play Pikmin.
[434.21s -> 437.77s]  I'll give you a date when I figure that out.
[437.77s -> 441.77s]  Because I don't want to say, we're going to play Pikmin 2 in four days.
[441.77s -> 445.77s]  And I, like, go on Amazon, it's going to take six days to get her, even with, like, Prime or something.
[445.77s -> 447.77s]  I can't- I'm not doing that.
[447.77s -> 450.77s]  I'm going to play Pik- which one should I play?
[450.77s -> 459.90s]  It's Pikmin 2, right? Should I just do them all?
[459.90s -> 463.90s]  If I play Pikmin 1, people that love Pikmin 2 are going to be pissed that I played Pikmin 1.
[463.90s -> 465.90s]  If I play Pikmin 2 first, people are going to be mad that I skipped Pikmin 1.
[465.90s -> 470.90s]  They're going to be, that's the best one, go play- and if I play Pikmin 3, all of you are going to be mad.
[470.90s -> 472.90s]  Because that's universally the hated one.
[472.90s -> 476.61s]  Nobody likes Pikmin 1.
[476.61s -> 484.10s]  3 is good. Uh oh.
[484.10s -> 486.27s]  Did I just do it? Did I start the war?
[486.27s -> 492.09s]  I'll do a poll. Alright, we're going to do a poll at the end of this chat as to which Pikmin I'm going to play.
[492.09s -> 495.71s]  By the way, I- hold on.
[495.71s -> 508.60s]  I think I, uh, I think I already have one.
[508.60s -> 518.02s]  Was I able to buy it twice? I forgot I owned it.
[518.02s -> 533.19s]  Which one do I have?
[533.19s -> 538.59s]  I want it.
[538.59s -> 546.04s]  What's the one that's on Wii?
[546.04s -> 549.50s]  I have it somewhere. What's the one that's on Wii?
[549.50s -> 557.05s]  One or two.
[557.05s -> 559.05s]  One and two are on Wii. Huh.
[559.05s -> 561.61s]  Both are on Wii. Okay.
[561.61s -> 564.61s]  Let me see if I can find it. I actually think I really do own it.
[564.61s -> 568.77s]  Alright. Let's go. We're going to play Spore.
[568.77s -> 572.77s]  I don't have- I forget everything. I fucking have no idea how to play this game.
[572.77s -> 578.38s]  Find it.
[578.38s -> 582.10s]  You have to find it already.
[582.10s -> 585.10s]  Spore. Alright, so for all you Spore-andies.
[585.10s -> 587.72s]  Should I?
[587.72s -> 592.30s]  Should I just play the- start a new game?
[592.30s -> 594.61s]  Or should we make a creature?
[594.61s -> 595.91s]  What do you think?
[595.91s -> 604.95s]  Should I just go with the DNA builder thing, or should I make a creature?
[604.95s -> 610.13s]  I feel like if I make a creature right now, I'm gonna end up sitting here for the next, like, six hours.
[610.13s -> 618.04s]  Just new game, just new game, new game, new game, new game, new game, new game, new game, new game, new game.
[618.04s -> 620.04s]  Okay. Alright, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.
[620.04s -> 621.04s]  Make a creature, you dickhead.
[621.04s -> 623.04s]  I'm not gonna.
[623.04s -> 630.53s]  New game, please. New game, please.
[630.53s -> 635.95s]  Do I do a poll?
[635.95s -> 637.45s]  Alright, I'll do a poll.
[637.45s -> 639.45s]  Just new game or make creatures?
[639.45s -> 647.41s]  Oh, you're gonna- I have to desktop capture this.
[647.41s -> 656.61s]  I'm not supposed to see this shit. Hold on.
[656.61s -> 658.61s]  That's just the background.
[658.61s -> 662.61s]  Every single one of your parents' computers, that's the background that's there.
[662.61s -> 666.98s]  I just gave a bunch of you guys, like, weird flashbacks of going to, like, your grandmother's house.
[666.98s -> 675.62s]  You want the truth? I gave you the truth.
[675.62s -> 678.62s]  The reason why I don't have a three- a cool background is because I have three monitors.
[678.62s -> 682.62s]  And I have no idea how to make it go across all three of them.
[682.62s -> 685.62s]  And every time I do it, it, like, stretches them and pixelates it and looks like shit.
[685.62s -> 688.62s]  Even if it's at the right resolution, I haven't figured out how to do it yet.
[688.62s -> 690.62s]  And I got three monitors, like, two or three years ago.
[690.62s -> 693.74s]  So I just don't even care anymore.
[693.74s -> 695.74s]  There was a picture of Carnage up at one point.
[695.74s -> 699.88s]  And then I think, um, I think, like, the Pac-Man ghosts.
[699.88s -> 700.88s]  And that was it.
[700.88s -> 703.82s]  Google it. I tried to Google it. It didn't help me.
[703.82s -> 706.06s]  Alright, what are we doing? What am I doing?
[706.06s -> 709.20s]  Oh, straw poll.
[709.20s -> 713.20s]  Alright, do you want me to start a new game and just play or do you want me to make a creature specifically?
[713.20s -> 720.41s]  Make a creature or start a new game?
[720.41s -> 728.00s]  This is important, guys. Come on.
[728.00s -> 731.90s]  This is impor- what's the difference?
[731.90s -> 734.90s]  Um, I don't know. I have no idea.
[734.90s -> 736.90s]  There's a difference. I know there is.
[736.90s -> 740.46s]  When you start a new game, you, like, have to build, like, a creature from scratch or something, right?
[740.46s -> 741.46s]  By eating food.
[741.46s -> 746.66s]  But making a creature, you just get to make everything you want and build one and use it later.
[746.66s -> 750.53s]  What the hell are you writing?
[750.53s -> 753.92s]  Make him see this. Make him see this.
[753.92s -> 756.92s]  Jeremy, you gotta make a couple creatures first. They can be shitty or cool or whatever you like.
[756.92s -> 760.92s]  When you do that and then start a game, you will see those creatures inside the game you're playing.
[760.92s -> 764.92s]  They're just the dumbass default Maxis-created creatures, so please make some creatures first.
[764.92s -> 767.86s]  Okay.
[767.86s -> 772.98s]  All right, all right, all right, all right.
[772.98s -> 776.63s]  All right, so we're gonna make a bunch of random- this is gonna take forever.
[776.63s -> 777.63s]  Whatever. Welcome to the stream.
[777.63s -> 784.34s]  All right. All right, here we go.
[784.34s -> 787.58s]  I'm gonna do that and then I'm not gonna make a creature for myself, though.
[787.58s -> 793.27s]  That sounds like a plan. Let's go.
[793.27s -> 803.68s]  I have a bunch of cool creatures made if you want to add me as a spore buddy.
[803.68s -> 804.68s]  I couldn't make an account.
[804.68s -> 807.68s]  I tried to, like, five times. There's an error. Like, there's a server problem.
[807.68s -> 812.24s]  All right, so should I do a foal creature or should I do little baby creatures?
[812.24s -> 817.13s]  Do foal creatures, right?
[817.13s -> 822.40s]  All right, here we go.
[822.40s -> 830.06s]  Mmm. New game, idiot.
[830.06s -> 832.06s]  No, I'm gonna make a couple of creatures!
[832.06s -> 835.82s]  All right, so this is my- where's the body? This is the body, right?
[835.82s -> 844.39s]  Let's go with, um, I want a standing creature.
[844.39s -> 847.78s]  I like- I kind of remember how to play.
[847.78s -> 851.50s]  Okay, you have to let- you can shrink the body and everything? Okay.
[851.50s -> 854.70s]  Remember, you don't even know how the animals work.
[854.70s -> 858.15s]  I have- I don't- I have no idea how to play the game.
[858.15s -> 860.15s]  I just remember- I remember- okay.
[860.15s -> 862.15s]  Here's what I remember about Spore.
[862.15s -> 868.47s]  I played Spore, like, 12 years ago. 15 years ago.
[868.47s -> 870.78s]  And I think I did this for, like, an hour.
[870.78s -> 874.46s]  Ran around and danced during the creature stage or something.
[874.46s -> 876.46s]  And then I- that's all I remember. I don't know anything else.
[876.46s -> 884.70s]  Let's pull that spine back a little bit.
[884.70s -> 886.70s]  That's what you do. That's all you do. Yeah, I know.
[886.70s -> 889.78s]  That is all you do in this game.
[889.78s -> 891.78s]  Uh, I think his head's- he needs to be-
[891.78s -> 892.78s]  There we go, like that.
[892.78s -> 896.54s]  Pull these back a little.
[896.54s -> 898.54s]  I'm gonna give him, like, a big- like a nice, like, Chad posture.
[898.54s -> 903.72s]  Align that spine perfectly.
[903.72s -> 905.72s]  There we go. Yep.
[905.72s -> 910.35s]  There it is. Perfect fucking spine alignment.
[910.35s -> 912.35s]  Does he got a gamer neck? No, he doesn't.
[912.35s -> 915.54s]  Why is this- how is this a gamer neck?
[915.54s -> 923.79s]  I guess I don't know what it kind of is.
[923.79s -> 925.79s]  Is he supposed to be, like, a cha- no.
[925.79s -> 928.16s]  Alright, this is looking a little-
[928.16s -> 932.15s]  This is looking a little-
[932.15s -> 934.15s]  I want- I do want to, like, a little bit of a gamer neck.
[934.15s -> 941.62s]  There we go.
[941.62s -> 947.77s]  Jesus. Okay. That's not bad.
[947.77s -> 957.03s]  Do we even- beak?
[957.03s -> 968.04s]  I don't know if I like the beak.
[968.04s -> 970.04s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[970.04s -> 972.04s]  It's a bird. No, but I don't want a bird.
[972.04s -> 977.86s]  Delete. How do I delete?
[977.86s -> 983.62s]  I kind of like this. No, no, no. A duck?
[983.62s -> 985.62s]  Oh, by the way, I- I- Can somebody that plays this game all the time-
[985.62s -> 987.62s]  I have the new parts, right?
[987.62s -> 990.50s]  Because I bought the whole package.
[990.50s -> 996.57s]  I do? No.
[996.57s -> 1001.03s]  What do you mean, no? It's not?
[1001.03s -> 1003.03s]  No, no, no, you don't appear to have them.
[1003.03s -> 1010.20s]  What? I installed everything. Really?
[1010.20s -> 1017.88s]  I don't have all the extra parts?
[1017.88s -> 1020.31s]  You do, you do, you do, you do.
[1020.31s -> 1022.49s]  I didn't get scammed. Okay.
[1022.49s -> 1024.49s]  He does, you do. Alright, so they're lying to me, alright.
[1024.49s -> 1033.03s]  What about this one?
[1033.03s -> 1036.23s]  Right down here? Two mouths?
[1036.23s -> 1039.56s]  I kind of like that.
[1039.56s -> 1045.00s]  That's doing it for me.
[1045.00s -> 1052.17s]  Give him a tiny face.
[1052.17s -> 1060.36s]  A huge underbite?
[1060.36s -> 1062.54s]  Got a mask on. Alright, I like that.
[1062.54s -> 1067.66s]  I like this one too. But that's alright, we can make more than one.
[1067.66s -> 1071.43s]  How do I, um, zoom in?
[1071.43s -> 1076.02s]  It's not mouse scroll.
[1076.02s -> 1082.10s]  How do I zoom in with the mouse?
[1082.10s -> 1084.73s]  Okay, that looks good. Eyes. How about, um-
[1084.73s -> 1089.27s]  These are eyes? These are pig eyes.
[1089.27s -> 1094.18s]  These are pig nose. These are ears.
[1094.18s -> 1102.30s]  Okay, how about, um- I like that.
[1102.30s -> 1105.05s]  I like that even better though.
[1105.05s -> 1114.07s]  Yep. I like this.
[1114.07s -> 1125.58s]  Holy shit, he's evil. Did he be evil? Toad.
[1125.58s -> 1130.06s]  I kind of like it with the eyes
[1130.06s -> 1132.06s]  down, like this.
[1132.06s -> 1135.64s]  I'm very upset.
[1135.64s -> 1141.72s]  Or, I don't know, how about-
[1141.72s -> 1144.92s]  This is just what your dog does when you have french fries.
[1144.92s -> 1148.44s]  It just sits like this, as a statue.
[1148.44s -> 1153.67s]  Um, alright, should I do
[1153.67s -> 1155.67s]  kind of evil? I'm sure I'll do
[1155.67s -> 1163.21s]  french fry dog. I like that.
[1163.21s -> 1165.64s]  Alright, now we need- Do I like this body?
[1165.64s -> 1173.06s]  I think the body could be better.
[1173.06s -> 1179.08s]  Just give him a huge belly. This is just a guy
[1179.08s -> 1185.91s]  running around in an alien suit.
[1185.91s -> 1189.62s]  Okay, let me see. Arms and legs.
[1189.62s -> 1192.38s]  Wait, what's this thing? Ears? No, no ears.
[1192.38s -> 1201.18s]  Zero ears. Pregnant.
[1201.18s -> 1203.18s]  Should we give him- Should he even have arms?
[1203.18s -> 1212.63s]  Maybe he should even have arms.
[1212.63s -> 1220.06s]  Grasshopper legs? I want the big stomach.
[1220.06s -> 1242.12s]  Okay, that's not bad. He's sitting
[1242.12s -> 1244.12s]  on his own- He's sitting on his own
[1244.12s -> 1248.02s]  legs. Jesus Christ, what?
[1248.02s -> 1257.80s]  It's a flamingo? Isn't that backwards?
[1257.80s -> 1270.15s]  Yeah, these are too big. Alright, there we go.
[1270.15s -> 1273.42s]  That means it has extra jumping
[1273.42s -> 1285.18s]  ability, right?
[1285.18s -> 1288.89s]  Try walking. Oh, how do you do that?
[1288.89s -> 1303.00s]  Test drive. How do I make him walk?
[1303.00s -> 1308.82s]  His neck. Oh, look, it hurts.
[1308.82s -> 1314.01s]  He's going like- Ow! What else is this?
[1314.01s -> 1317.90s]  Okay, spin. He can spin?
[1317.90s -> 1326.52s]  Roar. Alright, how about a flip? Nice.
[1326.52s -> 1329.66s]  How about a- Where's the dance?
[1329.66s -> 1332.65s]  It goes-
[1332.65s -> 1337.05s]  Scared. Sad.
[1337.05s -> 1342.47s]  Where's- Where's dance?
[1342.47s -> 1351.22s]  Ball, sit, punch. Here we go.
[1351.22s -> 1359.72s]  Here it is. Oh, I love it.
[1359.72s -> 1363.82s]  Toe tap. That's my favorite one
[1363.82s -> 1369.90s]  when they shake their head around. Okay, I like it.
[1369.90s -> 1375.53s]  I'm gonna keep going. Okay, we have feet.
[1375.53s -> 1378.47s]  Weapons. Oh, shit, hold on.
[1378.47s -> 1393.00s]  He has like a saw blade on his stomach?
[1393.00s -> 1398.12s]  I'm just making a battle bot. Silent hill
[1398.12s -> 1402.54s]  monster. Give him- Okay, wait, that's true.
[1402.54s -> 1405.80s]  That is kind of- What if they're on his, like,
[1405.80s -> 1409.64s]  arms? What about the little T-Rex saw
[1409.64s -> 1414.63s]  blade? Oh, I kinda like that.
[1414.63s -> 1419.82s]  These are his hands. No, no, no, no, no.
[1419.82s -> 1428.57s]  Mantis? I kinda like this. I'm gonna
[1428.57s -> 1440.92s]  flip him around, though, because these are his arms.
[1440.92s -> 1452.62s]  No, I don't like that either.
[1452.62s -> 1456.46s]  This isn't even my creature. Why do I even care?
[1456.46s -> 1460.49s]  Details. Gems?
[1460.49s -> 1466.57s]  I put gems all over him? Wait, what is this?
[1466.57s -> 1475.32s]  I can give him a little propeller?
[1475.32s -> 1477.32s]  Oh, I love it. I love it, I love it, I love it. Hold on.
[1477.32s -> 1493.37s]  Definitely keeping that on. What about
[1493.37s -> 1495.37s]  some little, like, fluffies on his
[1495.37s -> 1499.00s]  shoulders? On his knees? Okay.
[1499.00s -> 1505.91s]  This is what every German 985
[1505.91s -> 1507.91s]  fan looks like. God damn it, I clicked out
[1507.91s -> 1517.05s]  of the chat box. This is what every
[1517.05s -> 1519.05s]  German 985 fan looks like. Alright, what we got?
[1519.05s -> 1522.76s]  We have singing. He's very good at
[1522.76s -> 1526.54s]  singing. Okay, he's got a good mating
[1526.54s -> 1529.80s]  call. He's got very good eyesight.
[1529.80s -> 1531.80s]  He's kind of- Not that fast.
[1531.80s -> 1537.75s]  He's got 40 health, okay. Now, hold on.
[1537.75s -> 1542.15s]  Uh, should he have
[1542.15s -> 1544.15s]  arms or not? No, definitely not.
[1544.15s -> 1562.78s]  Give him some more legs. Maybe I'll give him some more legs.
[1562.78s -> 1571.74s]  Hold on. Is his head too heavy, though?
[1571.74s -> 1583.13s]  His head might be too heavy. He's doing the
[1583.13s -> 1594.14s]  Kubrick stare. I like him. Alright,
[1594.14s -> 1596.95s]  good. Let's, um,
[1596.95s -> 1604.36s]  change the color? Yeah.
[1604.36s -> 1612.28s]  Alright, paint mode. What are you thinking?
[1612.28s -> 1615.93s]  Uh, let's see. Marine?
[1615.93s -> 1622.46s]  Flesh, flesh, flesh, flesh colored.
[1622.46s -> 1626.49s]  I kinda like the, like,
[1626.49s -> 1632.42s]  cantaloupe. I
[1632.42s -> 1638.57s]  really like the cantaloupe. It's perfect.
[1638.57s -> 1642.34s]  Partial styles? Oh, you can do partial,
[1642.34s -> 1645.86s]  right? Give him more legs. Alright, hold on.
[1645.86s -> 1651.56s]  He's got jumping legs, and
[1651.56s -> 1654.89s]  how about- What about these weird ones
[1654.89s -> 1668.07s]  in the front? Ooh, wait a minute.
[1668.07s -> 1677.48s]  No, that looks ugly. You're gonna
[1677.48s -> 1685.72s]  ruin him. I'm just- I'm just looking.
[1685.72s -> 1691.74s]  Just one leg in the front. You made
[1691.74s -> 1693.74s]  a creeper. I did?
[1693.74s -> 1700.95s]  I kinda did. Can he just
[1700.95s -> 1708.89s]  do one single leg? It's a creeper.
[1708.89s -> 1711.51s]  Even the
[1711.51s -> 1717.02s]  flower on his head. Alright, I don't-
[1717.02s -> 1719.02s]  I'll have to make a few more, so we're gonna
[1719.02s -> 1722.98s]  leave him alone. Doesn't the creeper
[1722.98s -> 1725.99s]  have, like, a flower? Who has a flower
[1725.99s -> 1730.02s]  on their head? That's a fake fan.
[1730.02s -> 1732.02s]  What enemy has a flower on their head?
[1732.02s -> 1737.27s]  Oh, it's a Pikmin. It's a Pikmin. We just talked about
[1737.27s -> 1740.09s]  Pikmin. Okay, that's what it is. Yeah,
[1740.09s -> 1747.70s]  it's a Pikmin. Thank you. I kinda like the
[1747.70s -> 1751.48s]  bear claws. Wait, what?
[1751.48s -> 1760.31s]  Oh, shit. No, no, no. Should I give him, like, the bird feet?
[1760.31s -> 1768.94s]  Bear claws or bird feet? Which one?
[1768.94s -> 1777.38s]  Bird feet. Definitely. What's he doing?
[1777.38s -> 1790.70s]  He did that with his feet, by the way.
[1790.70s -> 1796.63s]  No arms. I like it.
[1796.63s -> 1799.26s]  It's perfect. Those are hands. They are?
[1799.26s -> 1805.66s]  Those are arms?
[1805.66s -> 1812.87s]  I thought those were legs.
[1812.87s -> 1814.87s]  Okay, we're gonna- Alright, that's enough.
[1814.87s -> 1821.13s]  Name creature. Creature's name is gonna be...
[1821.13s -> 1826.38s]  It has to be some type of cantaloupe.
[1826.38s -> 1833.53s]  I mean, no. No, no, no, no.
[1833.53s -> 1840.68s]  Cantafloat.
[1840.68s -> 1843.82s]  Give him feet. Why does he need feet?
[1843.82s -> 1853.85s]  Go feet. The creepalope.
[1853.85s -> 1855.85s]  That's awful. I actually kinda like it, though.
[1855.85s -> 1886.76s]  The creepalope. There we go.
[1886.76s -> 1899.03s]  Tags. Who cares?
[1899.03s -> 1901.66s]  I don't know how to say yes. Alright, there he is. The creepalope.
[1901.66s -> 1906.20s]  Hold A when placing a part for
[1906.20s -> 1908.70s]  symmetry mode. Okay. He unironically
[1908.70s -> 1911.32s]  needs feet, though. Does he?
[1911.32s -> 1913.88s]  Unironically?
[1913.88s -> 1921.88s]  Unironically?
[1921.88s -> 1930.70s]  Am I buying these now?
[1930.70s -> 1934.79s]  Should we webbed feet?
[1934.79s -> 1941.00s]  These bird feet. Unironically, yes.
[1941.00s -> 1950.20s]  Alright, fine.
[1950.20s -> 1953.70s]  He's looking good. I think he's good to go.
[1953.70s -> 1956.01s]  How do we say yes? Save and exit.
[1956.01s -> 1958.31s]  I need to make another one, right?
[1958.31s -> 1960.55s]  So save this one and exit, and then do it again.
[1960.55s -> 1968.81s]  I need to make a few, right? This next one's gonna be
[1968.81s -> 1979.05s]  a hellish creation, by the way.
[1979.05s -> 1982.44s]  I wanna make a big snake. Let's see.
[1982.44s -> 1988.20s]  What do I wanna do? I think I'm just gonna make a snake.
[1988.20s -> 1997.34s]  Snakes don't have feet.
[1997.34s -> 1999.34s]  Let's pull this back a little more.
[1999.34s -> 2015.91s]  I'm gonna make a scorpion.
[2015.91s -> 2026.41s]  Definitely make it a scorpion.
[2026.41s -> 2029.86s]  I want a big, dangerous tail.
[2029.86s -> 2033.58s]  Make this head smaller.
[2033.58s -> 2036.26s]  Looks pretty good. Mouth. What kind of mouth does a scorpion have?
[2036.26s -> 2041.56s]  Not that.
[2041.56s -> 2043.56s]  It's just a replace holder.
[2043.56s -> 2054.31s]  It's kinda like this gross thing, isn't it?
[2054.31s -> 2061.54s]  I kinda like it. Won't he stab himself in the head at all?
[2061.54s -> 2075.67s]  It's perfect.
[2075.67s -> 2082.38s]  That's perfect already.
[2082.38s -> 2087.05s]  Now, eyes.
[2087.05s -> 2104.06s]  Not bad.
[2104.06s -> 2109.24s]  I love him. Okay.
[2109.24s -> 2119.10s]  What about a pig nose?
[2119.10s -> 2122.49s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2122.49s -> 2127.10s]  I think without a nose, it's perfect.
[2127.10s -> 2129.10s]  Oh, should we give him one of these?
[2129.10s -> 2131.10s]  Oh, I love him. Can this be mine?
[2131.10s -> 2144.65s]  Can this be my guy?
[2144.65s -> 2149.13s]  Yeah, no nose. Just do nose holes.
[2149.13s -> 2163.00s]  How do I do a nose hole? It's fucking angry.
[2163.00s -> 2167.42s]  It's not angry.
[2167.42s -> 2178.41s]  I like the little ears, too.
[2178.41s -> 2186.07s]  Oh my god. What?
[2186.07s -> 2188.07s]  Okay, that looks alright.
[2188.07s -> 2191.72s]  The ears might be too much, but I really like them.
[2191.72s -> 2196.31s]  No, not yet.
[2196.31s -> 2199.45s]  He's gotta be lower to the ground. There.
[2199.45s -> 2205.06s]  We're gonna give him like a bunch of centipede arms.
[2205.06s -> 2207.37s]  What do you think? Centipede legs.
[2207.37s -> 2210.31s]  That's what a scorpion has, right?
[2210.31s -> 2212.81s]  Eye bones, bug leg. There it is.
[2212.81s -> 2215.75s]  Armored bones.
[2215.75s -> 2225.08s]  Look at that. Bug legs.
[2225.08s -> 2228.02s]  These are huge. These are way too big.
[2228.02s -> 2230.58s]  They're gigantic.
[2230.58s -> 2233.27s]  In order to get the other parts in the mod,
[2233.27s -> 2235.27s]  you have to launch Spore creepy and cute
[2235.27s -> 2237.27s]  instead of the base game. Please copy this so he sees.
[2237.27s -> 2247.37s]  Really?
[2247.37s -> 2250.81s]  Is that gonna fuck everything up?
[2250.81s -> 2259.45s]  He already has them. You already have them.
[2259.45s -> 2271.61s]  No, he doesn't. I don't know who to believe.
[2271.61s -> 2275.51s]  Alright, shrink these legs. Sorry, guys.
[2275.51s -> 2290.42s]  Destroyed on heal. He's ignoring us.
[2290.42s -> 2292.42s]  No, he has extra parts from an update.
[2292.42s -> 2296.12s]  Not the expansion. Really?
[2296.12s -> 2298.12s]  Okay, if I save this, can I go back and edit this guy later?
[2298.12s -> 2302.33s]  Remember, you have them.
[2302.33s -> 2305.14s]  Top left. Exoskeleton. Core Spore.
[2305.14s -> 2311.78s]  He doesn't have them.
[2311.78s -> 2314.22s]  Doesn't fucking have them. Stop lying.
[2314.22s -> 2317.16s]  There's mouths and eyes. That's not them.
[2317.16s -> 2319.91s]  That's not it. Chat. Wrong.
[2319.91s -> 2322.98s]  Not the DLC. What?
[2322.98s -> 2325.61s]  Okay, so I'm just gonna save this right here.
[2325.61s -> 2327.61s]  I'm gonna name this guy like fucking Bill.
[2327.61s -> 2330.68s]  And then I'm gonna save and exit.
[2330.68s -> 2343.40s]  Is that gonna work?
[2343.40s -> 2345.40s]  Launch Galactic Adventures if you have it to get both DLCs.
[2345.40s -> 2347.40s]  If not, then... Okay.
[2347.40s -> 2351.05s]  So we'll have to launch Galactic Adventures?
[2351.05s -> 2353.05s]  Why do they make it like this? This is fucking weird.
[2353.05s -> 2358.68s]  Yes, yes. Okay.
[2358.68s -> 2360.68s]  But what about my settings?
[2360.68s -> 2362.68s]  What about my, like, INI config files shit that I changed?
[2362.68s -> 2365.30s]  Do I have to...
[2365.30s -> 2368.82s]  Is there one EXE? Is there one EXE?
[2368.82s -> 2378.17s]  Who knows? There's three EXEs?
[2378.17s -> 2381.88s]  Hold on.
[2381.88s -> 2384.82s]  Let me just make sure this is not gonna fuck around.
[2384.82s -> 2387.06s]  I might have to change a few things.
[2387.06s -> 2391.21s]  That's weird. Bro, just open the game.
[2391.21s -> 2394.98s]  Open Galactic Adventure. Hold on.
[2394.98s -> 2397.74s]  Let me just make sure...
[2397.74s -> 2400.55s]  Take a look at some artwork for a little bit.
[2400.55s -> 2403.75s]  Take a look at some artwork for a little bit. I gotta figure this out.
[2403.75s -> 2408.87s]  Bro, it's just bugs next.
[2408.87s -> 2414.95s]  Look what I got.
[2414.95s -> 2418.66s]  Catboys!
[2418.66s -> 2422.63s]  Okay, let me open this.
[2422.63s -> 2426.60s]  They tell me there's three EXEs.
[2426.60s -> 2428.60s]  Let's check on that.
[2428.60s -> 2433.34s]  Let's see what the heck is going on here.
[2433.34s -> 2439.02s]  I don't think there is three EXEs.
[2439.02s -> 2441.02s]  Spore. Spore bin. Spore bin F1.
[2441.02s -> 2445.03s]  Spore app.
[2445.03s -> 2447.53s]  God, what the...
[2447.53s -> 2451.24s]  I don't know what the hell is going on.
[2451.24s -> 2453.24s]  Spore bin F1.
[2453.24s -> 2463.03s]  Spore app. Is that the one that I need to open?
[2463.03s -> 2467.45s]  No. It's the orange one. Yeah, that is that one.
[2467.45s -> 2469.45s]  Alright, I think I'll be alright.
[2469.45s -> 2475.85s]  Let me do this really quickly.
[2475.85s -> 2478.54s]  Galactic Adventure is from Steam.
[2478.54s -> 2482.36s]  Yeah, but I have to add some...
[2482.36s -> 2484.36s]  Resolution thing that I have in the other one. Hold on.
[2484.36s -> 2490.31s]  It runs at 1920x1080.
[2490.31s -> 2493.90s]  I gotta make sure it does that.
[2493.90s -> 2495.90s]  So Galactic Adventure will have all of them.
[2495.90s -> 2500.10s]  Is what you're telling me.
[2500.10s -> 2508.68s]  It might be really loud. I hope it's not loud. I'm gonna turn it off.
[2508.68s -> 2515.64s]  Okay.
[2515.64s -> 2519.08s]  Here we are. In the game.
[2519.08s -> 2521.08s]  That was incredibly loud. I'm so glad I
[2521.08s -> 2523.08s]  just saved all of you.
[2523.08s -> 2525.08s]  You can hear it through my headphones.
[2525.08s -> 2533.77s]  This shit is unbelievably loud.
[2533.77s -> 2536.89s]  Okay, let's try this again.
[2536.89s -> 2538.89s]  So, re-8. I gotta go back.
[2538.89s -> 2543.75s]  It runs real quick.
[2543.75s -> 2545.99s]  Alright, this is good to go.
[2545.99s -> 2548.66s]  This is good to go.
[2548.66s -> 2551.35s]  Okay, are we ready?
[2551.35s -> 2555.83s]  If I go to create, where do I go?
[2555.83s -> 2563.94s]  Where's my creatures?
[2563.94s -> 2571.30s]  Creature creator, you go to edit.
[2571.30s -> 2574.95s]  Okay.
[2574.95s -> 2578.98s]  What do you think?
[2578.98s -> 2588.18s]  Hold on, not yet. Hey, look at that.
[2588.18s -> 2590.18s]  There we go. I have the parts now.
[2590.18s -> 2593.69s]  Is this all of them?
[2593.69s -> 2598.74s]  Is this all of them?
[2598.74s -> 2602.07s]  Wow, I guess chat.
[2602.07s -> 2605.34s]  New creation.
[2605.34s -> 2608.41s]  How do I get my old one?
[2608.41s -> 2610.41s]  New creation, save.
[2610.41s -> 2615.85s]  You must save before sharing.
[2615.85s -> 2621.08s]  Where's the top left?
[2621.08s -> 2623.08s]  What do you mean top left?
[2623.08s -> 2625.08s]  Creepy and cute. There it is. Okay, cool.
[2625.08s -> 2627.96s]  Button and bottom left.
[2627.96s -> 2632.38s]  Sporpedia, bottom left, lower left.
[2632.38s -> 2634.92s]  Top left, bottom left, bottom left, bottom left.
[2634.92s -> 2637.35s]  What are you talking about? I don't see it.
[2637.35s -> 2643.48s]  Upper right. Sporpedia.
[2643.48s -> 2647.45s]  Ohhhh!
[2647.45s -> 2655.06s]  Alright, we're good. We're in.
[2655.06s -> 2661.78s]  I kinda actually really like the ears.
[2661.78s -> 2664.22s]  This is ugly. Well, whatever.
[2664.22s -> 2666.39s]  Alright, how do you duplicate? It's alt and what?
[2666.39s -> 2674.82s]  That's the hit sound.
[2674.82s -> 2676.82s]  Duplicate is what? F4? Just alt.
[2676.82s -> 2683.02s]  Copy, there it is. Oops.
[2683.02s -> 2693.11s]  How many legs does a scorpion have?
[2693.11s -> 2695.11s]  It's like eight. Or six?
[2695.11s -> 2698.89s]  I have no idea. I think it's six.
[2698.89s -> 2700.89s]  And the back legs are a little higher, right?
[2700.89s -> 2703.83s]  Because they're just fucking terrifying little monsters.
[2703.83s -> 2707.85s]  Okay.
[2707.85s -> 2709.85s]  That looks alright. Now we need
[2709.85s -> 2711.85s]  weapons. There we go.
[2711.85s -> 2716.63s]  There we go.
[2716.63s -> 2723.93s]  This is fucking dangerous.
[2723.93s -> 2725.93s]  That's too big. He'll kill himself with this.
[2725.93s -> 2728.23s]  What's the survival rate on these guys?
[2728.23s -> 2731.11s]  What if it's a limp?
[2731.11s -> 2736.23s]  Oh, I kinda like the big tooth thickness.
[2736.23s -> 2743.66s]  There's no sound?
[2743.66s -> 2747.56s]  Oh, shit. Sorry.
[2747.56s -> 2749.56s]  This is his tail.
[2749.56s -> 2752.89s]  Okay.
[2752.89s -> 2761.06s]  Details.
[2761.06s -> 2763.50s]  No wings or anything, right?
[2763.50s -> 2766.50s]  Wait, don't scorpions have arms in the front
[2766.50s -> 2769.96s]  that come out like big claws?
[2769.96s -> 2776.94s]  Dude, don't they? Get rid of these.
[2776.94s -> 2778.94s]  They're big lobster claws that come out
[2778.94s -> 2782.46s]  in the front. Okay, let's do big lobster claws.
[2782.46s -> 2791.91s]  What do we got?
[2791.91s -> 2793.91s]  They have six legs and two arms. They have six
[2793.91s -> 2800.82s]  legs, do they? How the fuck is that animal
[2800.82s -> 2802.82s]  real? You ever think about that?
[2802.82s -> 2804.82s]  How is that a real thing on planet
[2804.82s -> 2807.83s]  Earth? What a bizarre fucking
[2807.83s -> 2812.63s]  creation. Think about all these
[2812.63s -> 2814.63s]  animals and all these bugs and shit that just
[2814.63s -> 2816.63s]  look at how weird these things are. Look at how
[2816.63s -> 2821.69s]  ridiculous our Earth is. Bugs
[2821.69s -> 2823.69s]  are fucking weird. They really are. I
[2823.69s -> 2828.23s]  don't even know how to explain them. We already went over ants.
[2828.23s -> 2830.54s]  Ants are just a math problem.
[2830.54s -> 2832.90s]  They just follow code.
[2832.90s -> 2834.90s]  Bugs are just living math
[2834.90s -> 2844.31s]  problems. It's bizarre.
[2844.31s -> 2846.31s]  Bugs are math. We already did this. We already went
[2846.31s -> 2848.94s]  over how bugs are math. Bugs
[2848.94s -> 2850.94s]  are just a math problem. Like, we already went over this.
[2850.94s -> 2852.94s]  It's an algorithm that just plays out as like a
[2852.94s -> 2855.94s]  creature. Don't make me go over this again. A lot
[2855.94s -> 2857.94s]  of you weren't here a few years ago. I'll do it again.
[2857.94s -> 2870.02s]  Okay, hold on. What about sting?
[2870.02s -> 2874.55s]  Where's sting?
[2874.55s -> 2876.55s]  How do I use the weapon? Bite and charge?
[2876.55s -> 2882.81s]  He's just using his head. Why is he
[2882.81s -> 2885.88s]  leaning down like that? He needs
[2885.88s -> 2897.40s]  two more tiny front legs?
[2897.40s -> 2899.58s]  Does he? Two more tiny front legs?
[2899.58s -> 2926.06s]  Like that? No, it looks like he's
[2926.06s -> 2930.34s]  wearing a tie. Where's bug
[2930.34s -> 2933.80s]  hands? Arm plated,
[2933.80s -> 2937.06s]  brawned, humerus, tendinitis,
[2937.06s -> 2943.06s]  tubular, fleshed?
[2943.06s -> 2947.40s]  Like bones? I like these.
[2947.40s -> 2953.14s]  Jesus. Those are way
[2953.14s -> 2961.34s]  too big. Way too big.
[2961.34s -> 2964.98s]  Just absolutely enormous. And they go out
[2964.98s -> 2967.93s]  like that, right? Yep. Pull these elbows in.
[2967.93s -> 2973.61s]  This is way too huge.
[2973.61s -> 2976.87s]  Oh, he's fucking terrifying.
[2976.87s -> 2983.40s]  That. There we go. Well, actually, some scorpions
[2983.40s -> 2985.40s]  have big arms, like huge
[2985.40s -> 2987.40s]  hands and arms and stuff, like the emperor scorpion.
[2987.40s -> 2990.86s]  I'm a viewer of Clint's Reptiles.
[2990.86s -> 2992.86s]  Okay, I know what I'm talking about. And he gave it
[2992.86s -> 2995.03s]  like a three out of, a two out of five.
[2995.03s -> 3002.33s]  You don't want, scorpions are hard to have. Okay.
[3002.33s -> 3011.21s]  We need like lobster claws.
[3011.21s -> 3023.54s]  I mean, that's the closest thing I'm going to get.
[3023.54s -> 3026.23s]  Do they have mittens? Do they give them big mittens?
[3026.23s -> 3032.18s]  Give poison to the
[3032.18s -> 3038.58s]  stinger.
[3038.58s -> 3049.90s]  They're like big boxing gloves.
[3049.90s -> 3054.17s]  All right. I like it. It's perfect.
[3054.17s -> 3056.17s]  He's got these funny ears. He's so cute.
[3056.17s -> 3061.67s]  I love him. He looks like a baby.
[3061.67s -> 3067.99s]  Looks like Bernie. It does not
[3067.99s -> 3070.30s]  look like Bernie Sanders.
[3070.30s -> 3076.70s]  Okay. I don't even know where you're seeing
[3076.70s -> 3085.40s]  that from. The mittens. Oh, oh.
[3085.40s -> 3087.83s]  I was like, how is this Bernie?
[3087.83s -> 3089.83s]  Everything is Bernie. Or hold on. Let me do test drive.
[3089.83s -> 3095.08s]  I love it so far. All right. Let's do, first
[3095.08s -> 3097.08s]  of all, we got to do the point dance because that's
[3097.08s -> 3102.63s]  the most important one. Oh, yeah.
[3102.63s -> 3113.18s]  This might be the best one.
[3113.18s -> 3121.29s]  How about Raver? That's a good one, too.
[3121.29s -> 3130.44s]  I think we need to change the stomach a little.
[3130.44s -> 3137.91s]  I'm happy. I need a laugh, too.
[3137.91s -> 3141.94s]  He's like a donkey.
[3141.94s -> 3155.13s]  I love it. That's fantastic.
[3155.13s -> 3159.03s]  Okay. So if he's a scorpion,
[3159.03s -> 3164.41s]  scorpions are usually like a beige
[3164.41s -> 3166.84s]  color or sometimes a bright orange
[3166.84s -> 3168.84s]  and the bright orange ones are the fucking evil ones.
[3168.84s -> 3184.38s]  Yeah, the orange, the little
[3184.38s -> 3186.38s]  orange ones are the evil ones.
[3186.38s -> 3195.83s]  Ooh, that looks kind of cool.
[3195.83s -> 3199.35s]  The weird kind of like crusty hands.
[3199.35s -> 3208.31s]  He has like deep fried hands.
[3208.31s -> 3220.38s]  Hmm. I like it.
[3220.38s -> 3226.70s]  Could go red. Ooh.
[3226.70s -> 3234.25s]  That's cool looking, too. I like that.
[3234.25s -> 3239.54s]  That's my favorite so far. I could do patterns
[3239.54s -> 3244.60s]  too, couldn't I? Ooh.
[3244.60s -> 3246.60s]  I have to pick a clown.
[3246.60s -> 3255.27s]  Not this guy. All right. He's good.
[3255.27s -> 3257.27s]  I got to check. The body is going to be a little different.
[3257.27s -> 3260.02s]  Let me see. I don't want to ruin this. But don't you feel like
[3260.02s -> 3268.28s]  the body needs to be a little thicker right here? Just by a little?
[3268.28s -> 3278.26s]  He's down. All right. Yeah, just by a little.
[3278.26s -> 3280.26s]  Just a little. And add poison to this, right?
[3280.26s -> 3284.65s]  What if I put poison on it? Strike.
[3284.65s -> 3287.77s]  Ooh. Stab. Fight.
[3287.77s -> 3295.56s]  And you can sing, too.
[3295.56s -> 3305.86s]  Make it puke in the test walk. How do you
[3305.86s -> 3310.22s]  puke? Ta-da. Flex.
[3310.22s -> 3313.35s]  Sumo. Hey. Hey, baby.
[3313.35s -> 3317.00s]  Cutie. Happy. Laugh.
[3317.00s -> 3319.00s]  Scared. Angry. Swoon.
[3319.00s -> 3322.97s]  Sad. Where is it? Where's puke?
[3322.97s -> 3331.19s]  Oh. Bounce?
[3331.19s -> 3335.10s]  Dizzy. Oh, don't do too much.
[3335.10s -> 3339.43s]  Slow down. Sneeze?
[3339.43s -> 3345.38s]  That was the cutest thing I've ever seen.
[3345.38s -> 3348.71s]  Ballet.
[3348.71s -> 3354.01s]  Puke. He just stabbed himself in the head.
[3354.01s -> 3361.67s]  Lightning? Whoa!
[3361.67s -> 3367.37s]  Zombie walk? Oh my goodness, it's so
[3367.37s -> 3370.31s]  weird to control. How about bees?
[3370.31s -> 3378.95s]  There's an evil laugh?
[3378.95s -> 3385.21s]  I can't wait to hear the evil laugh.
[3385.21s -> 3392.81s]  Howl.
[3392.81s -> 3398.06s]  Banshee scream. Is this Sandperson?
[3398.06s -> 3403.86s]  Twitch.tv? Blast.
[3403.86s -> 3409.88s]  This is so cool. Okay. All right.
[3409.88s -> 3413.40s]  All right. Let's go. Stop hurting him.
[3413.40s -> 3415.40s]  This is acting.
[3415.40s -> 3419.86s]  I think he's good to go. I think he's perfect.
[3419.86s -> 3421.86s]  Somebody put poison on the tip. Can I even do that?
[3421.86s -> 3430.94s]  Wait. I could put spit
[3430.94s -> 3434.39s]  on this, right? Couldn't I?
[3434.39s -> 3436.39s]  He's got like a muffin on his tail? Hold on.
[3436.39s -> 3448.54s]  Okay. Let's have him spit.
[3448.54s -> 3453.02s]  It's like a combat. Punch. Oh, he's back here.
[3453.02s -> 3456.92s]  Bite. Strike.
[3456.92s -> 3462.87s]  Spit. Just goes into the air?
[3462.87s -> 3466.33s]  It's got to go to the...
[3466.33s -> 3472.58s]  Hold on. There we go. Hold on.
[3472.58s -> 3480.39s]  So he has like a poison gland that's right
[3480.39s -> 3482.39s]  there that he can just spit poison
[3482.39s -> 3491.86s]  at people after stabbing them. It's an anti-air
[3491.86s -> 3495.19s]  gun. Put it inside the spike.
[3495.19s -> 3504.65s]  Can I do that? Oh, shit!
[3504.65s -> 3514.30s]  I almost had it. What was it? Poison
[3514.30s -> 3517.37s]  spit. It's the muffin. There it is.
[3517.37s -> 3527.21s]  That looks kind of good. That looks really
[3527.21s -> 3532.07s]  good, actually. That looks cool. He has a strike.
[3532.07s -> 3534.57s]  He's got the charge.
[3534.57s -> 3537.77s]  He goes wham, then spit. Poison
[3537.77s -> 3542.62s]  spitter. Cool. All right.
[3542.62s -> 3548.44s]  He's ready. I don't... herbivore.
[3548.44s -> 3551.90s]  Why is he an herbivore? Your creature eats fruit.
[3551.90s -> 3553.90s]  No, he doesn't. I want him to eat other people
[3553.90s -> 3561.13s]  because he has the mittens and has no teeth.
[3561.13s -> 3566.82s]  So I guess with no teeth
[3566.82s -> 3568.82s]  and mittens, you're not going to be... So he's
[3568.82s -> 3573.80s]  just a murderer. Change his mouth?
[3573.80s -> 3576.55s]  I am not going to change this mouth.
[3576.55s -> 3579.11s]  I don't care if he eats dirt. Change the...
[3579.11s -> 3581.11s]  You want me to change? That's what makes all the
[3581.11s -> 3584.63s]  personality from this guy. Add another mouth.
[3584.63s -> 3587.32s]  Just like a hidden one underneath here?
[3587.32s -> 3591.98s]  All right. This is herbivore. Carnivore.
[3591.98s -> 3611.86s]  What if I do this?
[3611.86s -> 3613.86s]  This is fucking cursed. This is
[3613.86s -> 3630.89s]  cursed. No.
[3630.89s -> 3633.26s]  I don't want it. He can eat plants.
[3633.26s -> 3639.72s]  Yeah, he looks so much better that
[3639.72s -> 3642.86s]  way. Yeah, he can eat plants, but if
[3642.86s -> 3644.86s]  anyone fucks with him, he's got to...
[3644.86s -> 3650.34s]  You can kill them. Make it really small.
[3650.34s -> 3652.34s]  Make it just tiny on his tail.
[3652.34s -> 3658.87s]  I guess I could make just a little
[3658.87s -> 3663.67s]  little pincer, a little tiny one.
[3663.67s -> 3665.67s]  Well, this is carnivore. I could put this
[3665.67s -> 3667.67s]  like under here. That would just be kind of like
[3667.67s -> 3678.62s]  a little thing under his belly. That doesn't
[3678.62s -> 3692.49s]  look terrible. Make it small enough.
[3692.49s -> 3694.49s]  That's just like a little addition. That doesn't mess up with his face.
[3694.49s -> 3696.98s]  Put it on his nose. Hold on.
[3696.98s -> 3702.79s]  I want to see what that looks like.
[3702.79s -> 3708.98s]  I cannot put it on his face.
[3708.98s -> 3710.98s]  No, you know what? I don't even want it.
[3710.98s -> 3713.22s]  I think it messes with the look. I want him
[3713.22s -> 3715.78s]  to eat plants. I want him to eat plants.
[3715.78s -> 3721.10s]  Yeah, I like him like this.
[3721.10s -> 3724.36s]  I don't want him to eat meat.
[3724.36s -> 3726.60s]  I want him to kill meat.
[3726.60s -> 3728.60s]  Like, I want him to stab meat, but not eat it.
[3728.60s -> 3730.60s]  This is a defense mechanism.
[3730.60s -> 3735.53s]  Okay, what's his name?
[3735.53s -> 3739.75s]  About, uh...
[3739.75s -> 3751.96s]  Gorp...Vegan?
[3751.96s -> 3757.34s]  Vegan. Vegan Bill.
[3757.34s -> 3770.82s]  Vegan Bill?
[3770.82s -> 3777.80s]  Is that what you want? Build vegan.
[3777.80s -> 3781.58s]  Carnivore Bill. How about, yeah, like
[3781.58s -> 3783.58s]  Meat Lover's Bill.
[3783.58s -> 3787.29s]  No, no, no, no, no. I'm going to make
[3787.29s -> 3791.70s]  a circle. I'm going to make a Meat Lover's Pizza.
[3791.70s -> 3797.34s]  Alright, that's the next thing I'm doing. Save it.
[3797.34s -> 3799.34s]  Vegan Bill is a new creation. Replace Bill.
[3799.34s -> 3808.81s]  Replace Bill.
[3808.81s -> 3810.81s]  Okay, how many more should I make? Like, two or three?
[3810.81s -> 3813.50s]  This is fun. Alright, I'm going to make it to
[3813.50s -> 3825.00s]  Meat Lover's Pizza. This will be quick.
[3825.00s -> 3827.00s]  It's just going to be a large Meat Lover's Pizza.
[3827.00s -> 3837.61s]  Hmm, this is too thick.
[3837.61s -> 3843.80s]  I know what to do. Make a tiny, tiny
[3843.80s -> 3845.80s]  body and a big circle head and just put all the pizza
[3845.80s -> 3849.38s]  ingredients on his head. Throw it in the spine.
[3849.38s -> 3854.87s]  Ah, that's true. Okay.
[3854.87s -> 3863.64s]  Alright, so this is good. There we go.
[3863.64s -> 3866.01s]  It needs to be a little bit, like, there.
[3866.01s -> 3871.69s]  Put this in the oven.
[3871.69s -> 3873.69s]  Alright, Meat Lover's Pizza. We need, like, cheese and then sauce.
[3873.69s -> 3876.82s]  First of all, let's get the base here.
[3876.82s -> 3882.14s]  That looks like a pretty good crust.
[3882.14s -> 3892.25s]  But hold on. That looks like a...
[3892.25s -> 3894.25s]  That's perfect. That's a perfect, like, pizza crust.
[3894.25s -> 3899.86s]  Yup, keeping it.
[3899.86s -> 3903.26s]  Okay, now we need
[3903.26s -> 3905.50s]  details. What have we got?
[3905.50s -> 3910.94s]  Definitely some fucking basil on there.
[3910.94s -> 3912.94s]  No, that comes later. That comes after the sauce. What am I doing?
[3912.94s -> 3922.41s]  Alright, what, like, pepperonis or something?
[3922.41s -> 3925.80s]  What looks the most like pizza?
[3925.80s -> 3929.38s]  Ingredients. These, I mean, this could be.
[3929.38s -> 3933.10s]  Custom paint?
[3933.10s -> 3935.10s]  Do custom paint, custom paint, custom paint.
[3935.10s -> 3939.11s]  Hold on. Uh.
[3939.11s -> 3941.11s]  Paint like, paint like. How do we do custom paint?
[3941.11s -> 3945.85s]  Base. Okay, hold on.
[3945.85s -> 3954.65s]  A coat? Coat?
[3954.65s -> 3962.01s]  Yes! Nope, this one.
[3962.01s -> 3966.04s]  And the detail? Uh.
[3966.04s -> 3971.78s]  I don't think we need any detail.
[3971.78s -> 3974.66s]  I think that's perfect. We need cheese on it, though.
[3974.66s -> 3976.66s]  Um. This kind of looks like cheese,
[3976.66s -> 3979.67s]  but it's too much. It has to be on top. There we go.
[3979.67s -> 3984.28s]  That's pretty, that's as close
[3984.28s -> 3992.86s]  as it's gonna get. Or not, maybe. Hold on.
[3992.86s -> 4004.82s]  Mmm. Put black olives on it.
[4004.82s -> 4007.96s]  Hold on, we're not, we gotta, just wait.
[4007.96s -> 4015.51s]  Change the base color?
[4015.51s -> 4019.42s]  Disease pizza. Those spots kind of ruin it, though.
[4019.42s -> 4027.08s]  Change the color of the detail and coat.
[4027.08s -> 4029.08s]  Nice red pizza sauce.
[4029.08s -> 4031.08s]  Actually, that, I, I like the other one better, don't you?
[4031.08s -> 4043.99s]  This one, do you think this one's better?
[4043.99s -> 4045.99s]  The bright one you think is better? Actually, it probably comes up better.
[4045.99s -> 4050.01s]  Alright, detail.
[4050.01s -> 4055.69s]  Detail's gotta be white. Mmm.
[4055.69s -> 4067.38s]  Cheese. I can hold? Oh, okay.
[4067.38s -> 4078.20s]  This is probably close to pizza sauce.
[4078.20s -> 4080.89s]  Yeah, look at that. That's perfect.
[4080.89s -> 4082.89s]  Take the spots off. Yeah, I'm taking the spots off.
[4082.89s -> 4086.98s]  Do you use cheese with something else? Yeah, remove spots.
[4086.98s -> 4098.36s]  Fix the crust. Hold on.
[4098.36s -> 4103.22s]  Alright, let's go back here.
[4103.22s -> 4105.66s]  Now, I, the pizza sauce is up here.
[4105.66s -> 4108.73s]  Umm. This could be like a sausage
[4108.73s -> 4117.94s]  or something. Oh, fuck yeah, look at this.
[4117.94s -> 4122.74s]  Can I make these, uh,
[4122.74s -> 4126.25s]  like, pepperoni? Can I make them tiny?
[4126.25s -> 4136.34s]  Can I change the color of these? I don't think
[4136.34s -> 4141.26s]  I can change the color of those. Of the eyes.
[4141.26s -> 4144.52s]  Come on, really? Can't change the eyes?
[4144.52s -> 4152.57s]  They're just olives. Yeah, but I need
[4152.57s -> 4154.57s]  how many black, black olives
[4154.57s -> 4167.69s]  are disgusting on pizza?
[4167.69s -> 4169.69s]  All, all olives are like gross.
[4169.69s -> 4180.10s]  Alright, that's a lot of olives.
[4180.10s -> 4187.02s]  I need some, oh wait, wait, we need like basil.
[4187.02s -> 4189.02s]  Actually, I love olive oil. I love it.
[4189.02s -> 4202.50s]  So much. Umm, how do I
[4202.50s -> 4207.43s]  you hold alt to get just one, right?
[4207.43s -> 4214.58s]  How come I can't get one? Hold A.
[4214.58s -> 4218.81s]  I'm thinking like here, bring it down,
[4218.81s -> 4220.81s]  flat it, oh yeah, twirl it a little bit.
[4220.81s -> 4224.31s]  That looks good, so nice and cooked.
[4224.31s -> 4227.64s]  And then put it down. That, okay.
[4227.64s -> 4238.44s]  Twist it up a bit. Nice.
[4238.44s -> 4246.10s]  Looks good, okay. One more?
[4246.10s -> 4252.82s]  One more like right here. Get a little more.
[4252.82s -> 4256.97s]  Okay, cool. Alright, now we need cheese.
[4256.97s -> 4259.72s]  We need, there we go.
[4259.72s -> 4263.62s]  This could be like weird cheese. That's kind of
[4263.62s -> 4266.06s]  cheesy. What's more cheesy, do you think?
[4266.06s -> 4275.45s]  Like this? Flowers could be cheese?
[4275.45s -> 4284.31s]  What else we got? Horrible.
[4284.31s -> 4288.33s]  Hold on. This could be like mozzarella.
[4288.33s -> 4291.53s]  Yeah, that's like a nice mozzarella.
[4291.53s -> 4293.53s]  Answer me, you flimsy fuck.
[4293.53s -> 4296.15s]  What are you talking about? The armor plates.
[4296.15s -> 4303.37s]  Armor plates. That looks like
[4303.37s -> 4305.37s]  a nice, that looks like a fucking nice
[4305.37s -> 4312.34s]  slop of mozzarella. Oh, fuck yeah.
[4312.34s -> 4326.10s]  Perfect. Yeah, it's like a Neapolitan.
[4326.10s -> 4343.26s]  I need to move these around a little.
[4343.26s -> 4350.54s]  Okay, so let me move these around.
[4350.54s -> 4352.54s]  They need to be a little bigger too, because it's like the big
[4352.54s -> 4356.25s]  mozzarella circles.
[4356.25s -> 4361.30s]  There we go, that's better. This is a meat lovers
[4361.30s -> 4367.96s]  pizza with no meat. That's just regular pizza.
[4367.96s -> 4370.33s]  You should make the creature flat.
[4370.33s -> 4373.40s]  How do I do that though? Can I do that?
[4373.40s -> 4377.82s]  Can I squish them? What about the pepperoni?
[4377.82s -> 4382.34s]  I need something red. Just flatten
[4382.34s -> 4387.72s]  them. Miscellaneous parts from the details.
[4387.72s -> 4392.97s]  I need red though.
[4392.97s -> 4396.10s]  Wait, that could be, no. Flatten the
[4396.10s -> 4405.70s]  armor plates. It's as flat as I can get them.
[4405.70s -> 4410.12s]  Actually, it's good that they're different sizes though.
[4410.12s -> 4412.12s]  Like mozzarella does that on pizza all the time.
[4412.12s -> 4421.59s]  It melts different ways and shit. Oh yeah.
[4421.59s -> 4427.14s]  Yup. Yup.
[4427.14s -> 4432.65s]  Do we have warts all over it? Okay, how about
[4432.65s -> 4435.27s]  if I turn one of these upside down
[4435.27s -> 4441.86s]  it might look like a pepperoni.
[4441.86s -> 4443.86s]  That just
[4443.86s -> 4447.90s]  looks fucking weird. I hated that.
[4447.90s -> 4449.90s]  Alright, he has eyes. It's technically olives.
[4449.90s -> 4457.30s]  He needs a mouth.
[4457.30s -> 4464.60s]  Should just have this.
[4464.60s -> 4471.58s]  It's just like a dragon pizza.
[4471.58s -> 4479.70s]  Now it's a carnivore. Demon pizza.
[4479.70s -> 4484.89s]  And it can sing?
[4484.89s -> 4490.33s]  He needs feet. Does he?
[4490.33s -> 4492.33s]  Even just little tiny ones that you can't
[4492.33s -> 4499.99s]  even see? Oh hooves.
[4499.99s -> 4503.58s]  He needs legs. Hold on.
[4503.58s -> 4506.26s]  Do you have wings? Just a flying pizza.
[4506.26s -> 4517.64s]  That's a good idea. Where are they?
[4517.64s -> 4519.64s]  Flying pizza. Wings. Wings. Jump
[4519.64s -> 4524.62s]  and sprint. Sprint.
[4524.62s -> 4527.37s]  You don't need feet. Feet aren't required.
[4527.37s -> 4559.18s]  Okay, well I want him to fly though. This is just
[4559.18s -> 4572.81s]  unnerving. Does he need a, I don't think he even
[4572.81s -> 4581.00s]  needs a mouth. It looks like a watermelon.
[4581.00s -> 4594.36s]  Hold on. I take the mouth away. I mean
[4594.36s -> 4596.86s]  I like that better. I'm not sure if I'm
[4596.86s -> 4607.35s]  happy completely with it. Mouth is one part
[4607.35s -> 4609.98s]  that you actually need. Okay.
[4609.98s -> 4615.80s]  Ballet. Oh, that's what it would
[4615.80s -> 4626.87s]  look like if you dropped a pizza on the ground.
[4626.87s -> 4628.87s]  You know what's funny? I bet you there's a ton of pizza
[4628.87s -> 4630.87s]  places that have this pizza with wings
[4630.87s -> 4633.05s]  on it. And underneath it it says, We Deliver.
[4633.05s -> 4636.63s]  I mean, doesn't it feel like
[4636.63s -> 4649.82s]  this would be on the box? A hoedown.
[4649.82s -> 4668.23s]  He's flipping the pizza around.
[4668.23s -> 4670.23s]  Alright, I think I like him. I think that's good.
[4670.23s -> 4680.01s]  Mating call. Make the dough
[4680.01s -> 4685.75s]  brown. Hold on.
[4685.75s -> 4691.83s]  Let's check here. Brown you say. Hold on.
[4691.83s -> 4698.23s]  No, the dough's not brown.
[4698.23s -> 4703.27s]  It's like this. It's like a pizza crust.
[4703.27s -> 4712.79s]  It looks like a meatball.
[4712.79s -> 4716.38s]  This one's better. We go into
[4716.38s -> 4725.51s]  yellow. Hold on. That's rotten.
[4725.51s -> 4735.30s]  There we go. Perfect. How do I change
[4735.30s -> 4744.31s]  his face? Alright, looks good.
[4744.31s -> 4748.41s]  What's a dragon term
[4748.41s -> 4752.76s]  that starts with P? Meat lovers pizza.
[4752.76s -> 4765.29s]  Pizza angel. Aerodactyl.
[4765.29s -> 4770.60s]  Where'd the sauce go? When you're
[4770.60s -> 4774.70s]  in the building mode it goes away I think.
[4774.70s -> 4784.17s]  Wood fired pizza. That's just describing
[4784.17s -> 4786.73s]  what this is on the menu. It's not an
[4786.73s -> 4801.19s]  animal's name. Pizza Griffin.
[4801.19s -> 4803.19s]  Oh my god. Ban that person for at least a
[4803.19s -> 4806.90s]  minute. Pizza. Wood fired
[4806.90s -> 4811.90s]  pizza.
[4811.90s -> 4814.57s]  What are people writing? You're writing
[4814.57s -> 4818.86s]  pterodactyl with pepperoni in it?
[4818.86s -> 4821.61s]  Pizzadactyl. Pizzadactyl.
[4821.61s -> 4823.61s]  Oh god damn it. I clicked out of the
[4823.61s -> 4828.60s]  fucking screen. Pizza Griffin is unironically
[4828.60s -> 4830.60s]  good. It is not unironically good. It is
[4830.60s -> 4840.84s]  unironically awful. I like
[4840.84s -> 4849.22s]  pizzadactyl. How do you spell it?
[4849.22s -> 4851.66s]  Pizzadactyly. Pizzadactyly.
[4851.66s -> 4861.62s]  Pizzadactyl. Pterodactyl.
[4861.62s -> 4866.10s]  I've turned into
[4866.10s -> 4868.10s]  pterodactyl. I am now
[4868.10s -> 4870.10s]  pterodactyl.
[4870.10s -> 4872.98s]  And he flies
[4872.98s -> 4874.98s]  and smashes right into the side of like
[4874.98s -> 4878.50s]  Cleveland's house. And then cuts back to the show.
[4878.50s -> 4892.25s]  That's good. I like it. Alright. How many more
[4892.25s -> 4900.82s]  should I make? Carrot. We're making a carrot. It's a carrot.
[4900.82s -> 4910.28s]  We're making a carrot. And we're gonna make sure that
[4910.28s -> 4913.35s]  the carrot and the pizza tribes
[4913.35s -> 4929.22s]  hate each other. Why are you so hungry?
[4929.22s -> 4939.32s]  I don't know. I just kinda am. What the fuck does a carrot
[4939.32s -> 4955.56s]  look like? Like that, right? What the fuck
[4955.56s -> 4957.56s]  does a carrot look like? It's like that, right? Yeah.
[4957.56s -> 4962.79s]  And there's green up top. Alright, here we go.
[4962.79s -> 4967.02s]  What should his face be?
[4967.02s -> 4977.00s]  It's just one of the birds from Angry Birds.
[4977.00s -> 4987.24s]  Why is everybody freaking out? It looks like a
[4987.24s -> 4990.95s]  squash. This is what a carrot
[4990.95s -> 4993.96s]  looks like when you pull it out of the ground. What are you talking about?
[4993.96s -> 5013.21s]  Give him a scary mouth. I like that.
[5013.21s -> 5019.40s]  Let's get the, uh, the, let's get
[5019.40s -> 5031.99s]  this correct. Too much spinning. There you go.
[5031.99s -> 5040.42s]  Okay, good. Yes!
[5040.42s -> 5045.72s]  The cabbage. This guy is so
[5045.72s -> 5048.02s]  hungry. Why would, okay, let me
[5048.02s -> 5052.31s]  let's get something clear here. If
[5052.31s -> 5054.31s]  somebody is like starving and really hungry
[5054.31s -> 5056.31s]  and they're on stream, they're a streamer,
[5056.31s -> 5058.87s]  you think they would be making a carrot?
[5058.87s -> 5061.75s]  No. They would be making like steak
[5061.75s -> 5063.75s]  and cheese subs and like hamburgers and stuff.
[5063.75s -> 5066.50s]  I make a carrot? A carrot.
[5066.50s -> 5072.07s]  You guys think, oh, he's so high right now
[5072.07s -> 5074.95s]  and all he can think about is food.
[5074.95s -> 5076.95s]  I can't think of one person I've ever seen that's ever been
[5076.95s -> 5078.95s]  high and you go, hey Ben, you wanna get some
[5078.95s -> 5081.50s]  munchies? Yeah.
[5081.50s -> 5084.89s]  How many carrots? I got fucking Doritos
[5084.89s -> 5086.89s]  and pizza and fuck, and hamburgers?
[5086.89s -> 5089.77s]  You don't wanna, wanna eat a carrot?
[5089.77s -> 5093.98s]  I've never heard that before. I've never heard,
[5093.98s -> 5095.98s]  somebody's never been high and asked me for a carrot. I'm just
[5095.98s -> 5100.01s]  gonna tell you guys the truth, that's never happened.
[5100.01s -> 5102.01s]  You know how many times somebody's been over here high
[5102.01s -> 5104.01s]  or over my, or like hanging out with me
[5104.01s -> 5106.18s]  high in my life and they've gone into
[5106.18s -> 5108.18s]  like the pantry and they're like
[5108.18s -> 5110.18s]  where are the Doritos?
[5110.18s -> 5117.99s]  Where are your carrots? You just get
[5117.99s -> 5121.51s]  high all the time. He hangs out with
[5121.51s -> 5125.74s]  stoners. Ha! Alright.
[5125.74s -> 5127.74s]  This is bullshit.
[5127.74s -> 5129.74s]  There's no way that you guys have, this is
[5129.74s -> 5131.98s]  a gaslighting campaign.
[5131.98s -> 5133.98s]  I don't think there's ever been a point where
[5133.98s -> 5135.98s]  one of you was asked for a carrot when you were high.
[5135.98s -> 5139.24s]  If you were, ever.
[5139.24s -> 5141.24s]  No, you reached for like the fucking beef
[5141.24s -> 5146.30s]  jerky and the Dorito bags.
[5146.30s -> 5148.30s]  I don't do drugs, Jerma. Well, good for
[5148.30s -> 5150.30s]  you, cause don't do them cause they're not that cool.
[5150.30s -> 5152.30s]  They're like kind of dumb.
[5152.30s -> 5156.01s]  All I'm saying is I've never asked for a
[5156.01s -> 5161.06s]  carrot when I was high.
[5161.06s -> 5163.06s]  Hey man, you got like any bags of like

[18969.89s -> 18977.34s]  I'm gonna play Pikmin. That's not as rare to find as thousand-year-do apparently
[18977.46s -> 18983.26s]  So am I gonna start what am I what am I because here's I'm gonna tell you the truth
[18983.26s -> 18988.78s]  I'm probably not gonna play all the Pikmin's. We're probably just gonna do one
[18988.78s -> 18998.07s]  I don't think I'm gonna aren't they all very very similar. I'm probably gonna play one of them, right?
[18998.07s -> 19005.86s]  I don't think I want to play all three or four Pikmin games or maybe we'll I don't know
[19006.34s -> 19011.14s]  Which one am I starting with because if I love the one that I play I might be so engrossed
[19011.14s -> 19016.82s]  I might play the other ones which one Pikmin 1
[19017.66s -> 19019.66s]  Pikmin 2 or
[19020.18s -> 19029.37s]  Pikmin 3 is there even a was there a fourth one their fourth game? No, it's just one two and three

[19038.64s -> 19043.28s]  Pikmin 3 I feel like it's a lot of this a lot similar content similar game
[19043.64s -> 19051.54s]  What do you think is after I play spore and we finish that tomorrow
[19051.90s -> 19057.76s]  I'm gonna play one. I'm whatever one you decide for me to start with is he not playing paper Mario

[19079.56s -> 19088.22s]  You kooza will be coming back. Apparently Pikmin 2 is winning by a very large margin
[19088.78s -> 19099.57s]  Seems to be an unreachable margin at this point. You also promised Mega Man Legends 2
[19099.61s -> 19112.07s]  Yeah, then I have promised a lot of things. You're right. You promised rage 2. I don't think I ever did I
