[1.91s -> 4.63s]  What is going on guys? Jerma here with a V-Log.
[4.63s -> 8.55s]  Quick little update. I just want to let you guys know what's going on with the channel.
[8.55s -> 14.58s]  I want to keep you guys in the loop. So a lot of you guys have probably noticed by now there are
[14.58s -> 22.04s]  ads on the videos. There are pre-roll ads and stuff like that. And that's because as of right now,
[22.04s -> 29.80s]  I am a machinima partner. And it's unbelievable to me guys. I really can't believe it.
[29.80s -> 33.77s]  And I got nobody to thank but all the people that support the channel.
[33.77s -> 40.18s]  You guys did this. I mean yeah, I make the content but you guys watch and you guys are always
[40.18s -> 44.66s]  supporting and you guys are always so helpful. You guys are always so awesome. Thank you all so
[44.66s -> 51.35s]  much. All my subscribers. You guys are fantastic. Unbelievable. And I also got to thank the guys
[51.35s -> 57.35s]  over at Respawn at the Respawn app. You guys are just as awesome because if it's not for you guys,
[57.35s -> 61.19s]  maybe I wouldn't even be seen. You know, maybe something like that would have happened. But
[61.19s -> 66.20s]  all the guys, all the employees at Machinima, I'm not going to let you down. I can promise you that.
[66.68s -> 72.06s]  And I'm going to start to take this channel a lot more seriously. I'm going to be making content at
[72.06s -> 77.38s]  the absolute best amount I can make it. The highest amount of quality I can put into it.
[77.38s -> 81.46s]  And I'm going to continue doing that. And hopefully you guys stick around. Hopefully you guys
[82.41s -> 88.76s]  are going to keep with me. Stay with the channel for a long time to come. So thank you all so much
[88.76s -> 93.78s]  everybody. You don't know what it means to me. The second announcement is I have an official
[93.78s -> 102.02s]  Team Fortress 2 server. The link or whatever, it'll be right there. It's dedicated 24-7 in Chicago.
[102.02s -> 106.26s]  That's there for you guys. If you guys ever want to play on it, just go play. It's open to the
[106.26s -> 111.38s]  public. Anyone can play on it. With the only exception that on the weekends or every couple
[111.38s -> 117.54s]  weekends I'm going to be doing an open lobby. So that information will be available if you are on
[117.54s -> 124.47s]  the Respawn app. So I highly suggest guys go to the Respawn app and be active there. Join the
[124.47s -> 130.06s]  Respawn app. Go check out new videos. It's a great place. It's an unbelievable community.
[130.06s -> 134.87s]  Please guys if you haven't already go over there and just be part of the community
[134.87s -> 142.54s]  because it's a great place. So thank you all so much. My brain is like all over the place
[142.54s -> 146.87s]  the last few days trying to piece together the stuff going on up here. But
[148.36s -> 154.49s]  thank you so much everybody. And peace, love, and respect. See you all next time.
