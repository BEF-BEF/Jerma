[0.89s -> 6.88s]  I didn't guarantee that, right? Did I 100% guarantee that I was gonna be here at 358 Pacific?
[6.88s -> 18.20s]  I don't remember. Did? Did I? It was a 100% guarantee. Shit. Well, whatever.
[18.20s -> 27.90s]  I'm here now, and that's all that matters. We're here now. I don't even link it. Link it. Link it. Screencap it. Screencap it. What?
[27.90s -> 30.66s]  I will start at the latest
[31.10s -> 36.03s]  358 Pacific, and then I said screencap this. Well, what?
[38.47s -> 45.06s]  Screencap it. Okay. So what? You screencapped it, and you proved me wrong.
[48.87s -> 58.79s]  Hey, you got me. Hey, guess what? You got me. By the way, can I just say, how do I sound?
[58.95s -> 66.11s]  Don't you think this is an immense improvement from the last time you heard me talk? I mean, an immense improvement.
[73.86s -> 77.90s]  Worse. Get out of here. I spent like 45 minutes making sure this sounded good.
[77.90s -> 86.40s]  I had the things in my ears, and I was leaning forward just being like, hello. Hello. Good afternoon. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
[86.60s -> 95.53s]  Hey, it sounds fucking clean. You should try whispering. No, I'm not. Why would I do that? I'm not gonna do that.
[95.93s -> 100.77s]  No one cares. Oh, right. No, hold on. We'll go over this.
[102.58s -> 104.81s]  Interesting.
[104.81s -> 108.36s]  Interesting week. Interesting few weeks, to be honest.
[110.02s -> 116.20s]  With all the stuff, all the moving, all the everything that happened with the dog. I said I didn't want to take any more
[116.92s -> 119.54s]  extended time off, but that
[119.54s -> 123.30s]  ended up not being the case, and somebody just gave a hundred dollars.
[123.38s -> 133.00s]  We had ten community subs from LM Man, five community subs from SoyDev, and then a hundred dollars from Gimme20Dollars.
[133.72s -> 136.63s]  Why didn't you give me 20?
[136.63s -> 145.98s]  Your name, Gimme20Dollars, gave me ten thousand bits. You went way over what you were supposed to give me.
[146.18s -> 151.93s]  No, does that mean I'm supposed to give you 20 dollars? Is that how that works? Anyways,
[152.82s -> 158.54s]  We are here after an interesting week. Those who don't know, I'll go over it briefly after I tweet this.
[158.78s -> 205.09s]  So just relax for a second. I just had to tweet that. It's gonna be hard to drink this.
[205.09s -> 210.61s]  I'm gonna dump this all over my nice microphone. It's a nice microphone. Can you tell? Did you tell that I got a nice microphone?
[211.21s -> 213.96s]  You couldn't. Let me get a little closer.
[214.78s -> 220.26s]  Anyways, let me see this. People made a Get Well cards for Otto, which is very, very nice. Very sweet of you.
[221.06s -> 223.70s]  I'll go over the story real quick. So
[224.62s -> 226.62s]  Otto,
[226.66s -> 228.66s]  four or five days ago now, whatever it was,
[229.38s -> 230.50s]  he
[230.50s -> 232.50s]  was going outside to go pee all the time.
[233.02s -> 237.22s]  I was like, what is going on? He's going outside every five, ten minutes. He needs to pee every ten minutes.
[237.22s -> 239.22s]  I'm like, this is not right.
[240.46s -> 247.53s]  Just because I was curious, after like the seventh or eighth time and two hours or so of him just peeing, peeing, peeing, peeing, peeing.
[247.97s -> 251.17s]  I'm like, you know what? Let me just put like a paper towel underneath
[251.81s -> 256.98s]  when he pees. So he went for like the tenth time, whatever, he goes out and pees and I put the paper towel under and
[258.18s -> 261.18s]  his blood on the paper towel. He's peeing blood.
[261.86s -> 268.36s]  At that point, you know, you have a fucking meltdown. You're like, what is that? Why is he doing that? What's going on?
[269.26s -> 271.70s]  And I just, I just brought him to the
[272.30s -> 275.08s]  emergency room. I brought him to the vet and
[276.36s -> 279.32s]  thankfully, they did a couple of tests and it turned out that he doesn't have
[280.00s -> 284.76s]  his like blood work was okay. His kidney function was okay.
[284.76s -> 291.24s]  And they did an x-ray of his abdomen to see if there's any growths or tumors or anything. And thankfully nothing there either.
[291.96s -> 295.33s]  But he had to go on antibiotics. They thought he had a UTI and
[296.61s -> 299.57s]  if you don't know this, Otto has Addison's.
[300.17s -> 309.09s]  So what Otto cannot produce, steroids. His body physically can't do it. There's a spectrum of steroid diseases.
[309.61s -> 313.77s]  You can either have Cushing's or you can have Addison's. Cushing's is way too much steroids.
[314.33s -> 319.49s]  Addison's is not very many or none at all. So he needs to get, every month
[319.49s -> 322.73s]  he gets an injection and he has to get steroids every month and
[323.89s -> 328.13s]  every other day or so, depending on how stressful the situations are, he has to take steroids.
[328.97s -> 330.74s]  Now,
[330.74s -> 332.54s]  because of the move,
[332.54s -> 338.14s]  it's been very, very stressful for him. Obviously because we moved to a new place. So he's
[338.82s -> 347.19s]  been very stressed out, you know, what's this new place I'm in? I don't like this. You brought me to a new place.
[348.47s -> 353.97s]  It's hard for dogs to kind of acclimate and a dog that has Addison's,
[354.47s -> 356.47s]  they think, at least the vet thinks, that
[358.27s -> 361.99s]  over the stress from the move and not producing, he gave himself a UTI.
[362.83s -> 369.89s]  Essentially is what I was told. But he's doing all right now. He is back to high spirits.
[369.93s -> 373.65s]  He's running around. He's almost done with his antibiotics. And I just wanted to take the time
[374.17s -> 376.17s]  over the last few days to make sure that he was all right.
[379.08s -> 382.28s]  Because obviously when he's peeing every 10 minutes,
[383.30s -> 387.74s]  somebody's got to be here to make sure he can go out and we can take care of him, make sure there's no blood.
[388.18s -> 391.06s]  So that's why I was gone for like another five days.
[391.90s -> 395.26s]  Sorry that I was gone. I really don't mean for this shit to happen.
[395.26s -> 399.34s]  It's just kind of bad timing as I come back like last week or so and I'm like,
[399.66s -> 405.02s]  Okay, we're gonna be doing four streams a week at least and I'm gonna be here every day. See you later.
[405.02s -> 409.05s]  I'll see you in a week. So I do apologize for that.
[409.65s -> 413.91s]  But we can go over how this is gonna play out here over the next
[415.19s -> 418.99s]  seven or eight days because obviously that was just that happened.
[420.03s -> 421.87s]  You probably noticed the title.
[421.87s -> 424.27s]  HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION HAS COME IN.
[425.03s -> 427.35s]  And that it that supersedes literally everything else.
[427.87s -> 431.87s]  I was under the impression that HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION wasn't gonna come in for like another week or two.
[432.39s -> 438.87s]  So I've decided I want to play HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION.
[438.87s -> 443.79s]  I hope I got the right one. And there's a funny story with this one too. I'm full of stories today.
[444.31s -> 446.98s]  Let's just move over so you can see it.
[447.18s -> 454.09s]  Anyways, so HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION. I bought this for GameCube and
[455.58s -> 461.09s]  I didn't get the GameCube one. I got the one for Xbox.
[461.45s -> 466.14s]  So I bought the one for GameCube and I got sent the Xbox, the regular Xbox one.
[466.38s -> 471.84s]  So thankfully I have a 360 and it can play Xbox games.
[472.20s -> 477.40s]  If I didn't own an Xbox or a 360 that would be probably pretty mad right now.
[477.84s -> 487.94s]  Is this the right one? What do you mean the wrong game? The incredible HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION.
[489.69s -> 497.76s]  8.9 out of 10 from Xbox magazine. This is the right game. Wait, hold on. Is it it's not is it HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION?
[498.16s -> 502.18s]  Or it's not THE INCREDIBLE HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION. This is wrong?
[502.70s -> 510.74s]  No, it's not. That would be the dumbest thing ever.
[510.98s -> 517.46s]  If you made a game called HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION and then somebody else made it THE INCREDIBLE HULK ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION.
[517.50s -> 521.74s]  There's a lawsuit there somewhere. That's stupid. No, this is the right fucking game.
[524.11s -> 527.55s]  Anyways, that's what we're gonna do today and maybe tomorrow depending on how much fun I have playing this and
[528.67s -> 533.03s]  we have a lot more money come. First of all, 10 community subs
[533.03s -> 535.23s]  I said it but I wanted but I don't want to just skip it.
[536.23s -> 541.39s]  10 subs is a lot of money from LM man. 5 from SoyDev. 100 dollars from Gibby20 dollars.
[542.95s -> 544.95s]  200 dollars from Fatal Finale.
[545.75s -> 551.12s]  220,000 bits and they say auto healthy.
[551.68s -> 555.35s]  Thank you for the fucking 20,000 bits.
[555.91s -> 558.35s]  That's a shitload of money to give a
[559.72s -> 565.44s]  fucking e-clown on the internet. Thanks for the huge amount of money Fatal Finale or Fatal
[565.88s -> 567.88s]  Fainal or Fainal Fatale.
[570.16s -> 572.16s]  No, Fainal Fainale?
[572.40s -> 579.78s]  There's no T in Finale. All right. It's been a long week. I feel like I've said it's been a long week.
[580.46s -> 584.34s]  Every time I come back to do a new stream week. Do I say that's like the last three weeks?
[588.30s -> 596.28s]  Rip Alex Trebek. Thanks for the five community subs. Fatal Finale again another 50 dollars.
[596.48s -> 601.02s]  You give him a shitload of money.
[607.51s -> 612.11s]  Yeah, I just want to look this up. Yeah, Alex. Alex Trebek is...
[612.59s -> 623.26s]  Okay, I was about to be I was about to get very very sad right there.
[627.62s -> 629.62s]  Anyways, a
[629.92s -> 640.64s]  Fatal Finale. Thanks for the 250 fucking dollars. Oh shit. I'm getting the screensaver in Xbox. That means like play the game, right?
[641.08s -> 645.03s]  Yeah, I see the card here. This is very very sweet of you guys.
[645.43s -> 653.72s]  It's always a scary thing when one of your most favorite things in the world might be very very sick. It's it's not good.
[653.76s -> 659.88s]  It's not fun. I really appreciate all the support and everybody that said all the nice things.
[660.28s -> 667.26s]  He's doing fine though. How do I play Hulk the incredible Hulk?
[667.78s -> 670.88s]  Ultimate 50 community subs that just came in from Zyxia.
[671.80s -> 683.48s]  Thanks for the 50 subs. Oh my god. That's a lot. That's a shitload of subs. That's that's ten subs times five.
[683.72s -> 690.68s]  It's a lot of money. That's an extreme amount of money. Thanks for the 50 subs.
[691.08s -> 695.40s]  Thanks for the five subs from Wingman and thanks for the 50 dollars from Dupa.
[697.40s -> 703.98s]  5,000 bits they say blush. For some reason blush. Why are you blushing? Thanks for the 50 fucking dollars.
[705.96s -> 712.90s]  Difficulty easy or normal you're gonna make me look bad if I pick easy, so I'll do normal. Thanks a lot guys. Seriously opening cutscene
[712.90s -> 716.70s]  I'm gonna be quiet and by that I'll probably maybe for the first 10 seconds. We'll be quiet, and then I'll be like
[717.66s -> 722.15s]  This is what happened to me today. That's what happens every time right? Not this time.
[722.25s -> 735.08s]  There's a thin line between good and bad. As you know how long my ethernet cable is right now.
[735.08s -> 746.28s]  Every single day when I stray from it, and this is me.
[748.53s -> 750.53s]  This is me.
[756.68s -> 760.14s]  Is this game any good? Were you guys lying to me? This game is terrible.
[761.14s -> 775.75s]  Why does it look like GTA 5? That was just a GTA 5. That's a GTA 5. That's the same graphics.
[776.39s -> 787.83s]  Branson military base present day. Is this where I punch a building once and it explodes?
[788.63s -> 792.56s]  VR?
[792.56s -> 795.04s]  Welcome to the HULK survival program.
[795.04s -> 795.54s]  What?
[795.54s -> 798.54s]  In this series of exercises you will approximate HULK's basic abilities.
[799.06s -> 801.06s]  Someone's playing
[801.38s -> 807.06s]  Someone's playing a VR game of the HULK of me controlling the HULK in an Xbox game.
[807.58s -> 810.90s]  Hasn't been following that?
[811.10s -> 815.79s]  Try running into various obstacles here to get a sense of the creature's power.
[815.79s -> 819.43s]  All this is merely a virtual representation of the beast.
[819.43s -> 824.95s]  It's not that impressive. Be reminded that HULK is actually capable of most feats demonstrated here.
[825.43s -> 828.63s]  Hold R. Another example of HULK's immense strength.
[829.15s -> 833.74s]  He seems capable of picking up virtually anything.
[833.74s -> 834.24s]  Cool!
[834.24s -> 836.24s]  Approach any object and press B.
[836.24s -> 838.74s]  Press the grab throw control to lift it.
[838.82s -> 843.66s]  Okay, that's a... am I gonna lose like the mech warrior stuff on the HUD on the screen?
[844.34s -> 847.66s]  Holy shit, that was insane.
[847.66s -> 850.61s]  A is jump.
[850.61s -> 854.94s]  Pressing X once performs a basic attack. Use X, X, X to do three punch combo.
[855.62s -> 858.12s]  This is already more fun than the last one.
[858.12s -> 862.26s]  Pressing the special button will activate HULK's more advanced techniques.
[862.78s -> 864.78s]  Unleashing everything he's got.
[864.98s -> 866.98s]  These will often launch or stun.
[867.18s -> 869.18s]  Knee smash, uppercut.
[869.18s -> 875.30s]  As with HULK's other techniques, holding the button will increase the power of each technique.
[875.30s -> 879.30s]  It is vitally important you research HULK's various combat abilities.
[879.30s -> 881.30s]  Wait, it's... it's like X, X, Y?
[881.30s -> 884.12s]  Extremely fast.
[884.12s -> 889.56s]  Y, X, X.
[889.56s -> 891.56s]  This is cool.
[891.56s -> 893.56s]  This is a complete list of HULK's known combat techniques.
[893.56s -> 898.87s]  This sounds too low in the game.
[898.87s -> 900.87s]  Should I blast it?
[900.87s -> 907.59s]  Chew... uh...
[907.59s -> 911.61s]  Alright.
[911.61s -> 913.61s]  Let's ultimate destroy, right?
[913.61s -> 915.61s]  Did that guy just say game on?
[915.61s -> 924.82s]  Wait, can I hold jump down?
[924.82s -> 934.17s]  That guy gave me a 10. I shouldn't have killed him.
[934.17s -> 942.17s]  Ooh, a cow.
[942.17s -> 945.88s]  Oh god, that was... Tara, that was horrible.
[945.88s -> 950.30s]  Okay, I don't want to do that again.
[950.30s -> 953.11s]  I don't want to kill cows.
[953.11s -> 957.46s]  Alright, let's do a mission.
[957.46s -> 963.29s]  This is just a sprint. This is sprint really fast.
[963.29s -> 965.29s]  Okay.
[965.29s -> 970.86s]  Am I the only one that played this game as a kid?
[970.86s -> 974.12s]  Now you learn how to... I thought that just said regret.
[974.12s -> 976.12s]  Now you learn how to target and attack enemies
[976.12s -> 978.12s]  by throwing objects at them.
[978.12s -> 980.12s]  Helicopters don't fly around, they just get them.
[980.12s -> 982.12s]  Once the beast has located a perceived threat,
[982.12s -> 984.12s]  he will launch objects with no
[984.12s -> 986.12s]  regard for human life.
[986.12s -> 988.12s]  Tap or hold the designated
[988.12s -> 990.12s]  grab throw button to launch
[990.12s -> 992.12s]  an object at your cost.
[992.12s -> 994.12s]  These guys don't even care.
[994.12s -> 1007.62s]  Can I sneak up on these guys?
[1007.62s -> 1011.40s]  Holy shit!
[1011.40s -> 1013.40s]  Okay, look at helicopter. Pull and hold L
[1013.40s -> 1015.40s]  to target the helicopter.
[1015.40s -> 1025.19s]  Okay, throw.
[1025.19s -> 1027.19s]  This is stupid.
[1027.19s -> 1029.43s]  I got it.
[1029.43s -> 1031.43s]  That was not effective.
[1031.43s -> 1033.43s]  Can I grab another helicopter to throw
[1033.43s -> 1038.36s]  at the other helicopter?
[1038.36s -> 1043.03s]  Whoa!
[1043.03s -> 1045.03s]  Alright, let's go. Where's the helicopter?
[1045.03s -> 1047.98s]  Holy shit, that was
[1047.98s -> 1050.15s]  destructive.
[1050.15s -> 1052.15s]  It's almost like I can feel the Hulk hands.
[1058.15s -> 1060.15s]  Okay.
[1068.15s -> 1070.90s]  Why is he...
[1070.90s -> 1072.90s]  You can switch targets while in targeting mode.
[1072.90s -> 1074.90s]  Target a helicopter, okay.
[1074.90s -> 1082.06s]  Awww!
[1082.06s -> 1084.06s]  This game makes you really feel like Hulk.
[1084.06s -> 1086.74s]  Why did he curve?
[1086.74s -> 1088.74s]  Why are these guys ping pong balls?
[1088.74s -> 1096.87s]  Alright, let's just get out of this
[1096.87s -> 1099.75s]  tutorial. They're homing.
[1099.75s -> 1103.53s]  This is fun.
[1103.53s -> 1105.53s]  I think I'm going to like this game. Now I understand why
[1105.53s -> 1107.53s]  you guys told me I bought the wrong one.
[1107.53s -> 1119.22s]  Oh, come on!
[1119.22s -> 1121.22s]  Was that a roller coaster tycoon roller coaster?
[1121.22s -> 1124.94s]  What was that?
[1124.94s -> 1126.94s]  That guy went far. Okay, I want to keep going.
[1126.94s -> 1142.41s]  This is fucking loud.
[1142.41s -> 1146.44s]  He's a strong one!
[1146.44s -> 1152.14s]  Look out! That's so...
[1152.14s -> 1154.14s]  Oh, god.
[1154.14s -> 1156.14s]  There's not a pigeon in the road, man.
[1156.14s -> 1158.14s]  This dude's throwing shit.
[1158.14s -> 1160.14s]  He's throwing whole tankers at you.
[1160.14s -> 1169.29s]  I need one more helicopter.
[1169.29s -> 1172.54s]  This one's pre-recorded.
[1172.54s -> 1174.54s]  Stop blowing
[1174.54s -> 1177.74s]  my fucking cover, dude.
[1177.74s -> 1184.07s]  Got it. No, I didn't.
[1184.07s -> 1188.36s]  Oh, yeah.
[1188.36s -> 1191.24s]  Show your new apartment.
[1191.24s -> 1202.18s]  Show my new apartment. Okay.
[1202.18s -> 1217.80s]  There it is. Bang place.
[1217.80s -> 1222.52s]  Or is it though?
[1222.52s -> 1224.52s]  Or is it though? Hold on a minute. What's this
[1224.52s -> 1243.91s]  big reveal?
[1243.91s -> 1248.84s]  Look at that thing! Oh, by the way,
[1248.84s -> 1251.66s]  it's Roger Rabbit, Slimer,
[1251.66s -> 1254.28s]  Qbert, and Carnage.
[1254.28s -> 1256.28s]  The four horsemen of the fucking apocalypse.
[1256.28s -> 1261.00s]  You're a nerd.
[1261.00s -> 1263.00s]  Welcome to Twitch.tv, you fucking
[1263.00s -> 1267.42s]  weirdo. What shirt is this?
[1267.42s -> 1269.42s]  Captain Marvel, I think?
[1269.42s -> 1273.06s]  Clown. It's a clown shirt?
[1273.06s -> 1275.69s]  I mean, this guy has a clown shirt.
[1275.69s -> 1278.89s]  There you go. You got to see it.
[1278.89s -> 1280.89s]  And I got the Binding of Isaac board game.
[1280.89s -> 1283.58s]  Look at my displays.
[1283.58s -> 1285.58s]  You see what's up there? Binding of Isaac
[1285.58s -> 1287.58s]  board game card game. I never played it once.
[1287.58s -> 1289.75s]  I just bought it.
[1289.75s -> 1291.75s]  I bought it a year ago.
[1291.75s -> 1293.75s]  Also, Seaman's up there.
[1293.75s -> 1295.75s]  This is a kid's apartment.
[1295.75s -> 1304.52s]  How is this a kid's apartment?
[1304.52s -> 1308.36s]  Is this a kid's bedroom?
[1308.36s -> 1311.50s]  Look, I'm at...
[1311.50s -> 1313.50s]  It's a kid's bedroom.
[1313.50s -> 1317.02s]  Look at that display.
[1317.02s -> 1319.02s]  That's Blinky. That thing turns into
[1319.02s -> 1321.02s]  Blinky, Stinky,
[1321.02s -> 1323.02s]  Guppy, and
[1323.02s -> 1329.61s]  Ralph?
[1329.61s -> 1332.04s]  Who are the...
[1332.04s -> 1334.04s]  I know Blinky's the only one. I'm a fake fan.
[1334.04s -> 1339.22s]  Clyde. There it is.
[1339.22s -> 1341.22s]  Show your face,
[1341.22s -> 1345.13s]  Carpet.
[1367.21s -> 1369.21s]  He's a man-child.
[1371.21s -> 1373.21s]  It's a coaster. Relax.
[1373.21s -> 1379.10s]  It's a fucking coaster,
[1379.10s -> 1383.90s]  guys. Man-child.
[1383.90s -> 1386.90s]  No, I have a look.
[1386.90s -> 1388.90s]  I have a streamer room now.
[1388.90s -> 1390.90s]  I thought about it and I was like, you know what?
[1390.90s -> 1392.90s]  I got to have Blinky back there like
[1392.90s -> 1394.90s]  Pac-Man. Cheeto.
[1394.90s -> 1396.90s]  I got like Q-Bird and stuff.
[1396.90s -> 1398.90s]  I'm a fucking streamer. This is a Redditor
[1398.90s -> 1404.34s]  room.
[1404.34s -> 1406.34s]  This is a Redditor office.
[1406.34s -> 1408.34s]  All right. Relax.
[1408.34s -> 1410.34s]  Relax, everybody.
[1410.34s -> 1412.34s]  This is a Redditor office.
[1412.34s -> 1416.82s]  No, it is not.
[1416.82s -> 1418.82s]  Redditors don't even fucking like Pac-Man.
[1418.82s -> 1420.82s]  If the Witcher,
[1420.82s -> 1422.82s]  if I had like a Geralt statue
[1422.82s -> 1424.82s]  up there, I would agree with you.
[1424.82s -> 1426.82s]  That's fucking Blinky, Stinky, Guppy, and
[1426.82s -> 1428.82s]  Brutal.
[1428.82s -> 1430.82s]  OK? That's not a
[1430.82s -> 1433.90s]  Redditor shelf.
[1433.90s -> 1442.09s]  Geraldo.
[1442.09s -> 1444.09s]  All right. I got to fucking read this shit.
[1444.09s -> 1446.09s]  You're distracting the fuck out of me.
[1446.09s -> 1448.09s]  Eggscramble just gave $50.
[1448.09s -> 1452.31s]  Not a Redditor shelf.
[1452.31s -> 1456.84s]  No, I'm sorry.
[1456.84s -> 1458.84s]  Q-Bird. You think Redditors care about Q-Bird?
[1458.84s -> 1460.84s]  Or Roger Rabbit?
[1460.84s -> 1463.34s]  OK, I'll give you Carnage.
[1463.34s -> 1465.34s]  But I liked Carnage before Redditor did.
[1465.34s -> 1467.34s]  Fuck. I got to stop saying that.
[1467.34s -> 1469.51s]  Slimer. I liked Slimer
[1469.51s -> 1471.51s]  before Reddit was even a website.
[1471.51s -> 1473.51s]  That's my favorite Ghostbusters character.
[1473.51s -> 1475.51s]  That shit was 1987.
[1475.51s -> 1477.51s]  OK? Reddit didn't come out until like
[1477.51s -> 1479.51s]  95. So please.
[1479.51s -> 1482.78s]  I'm a huge Slimer fan.
[1482.78s -> 1484.78s]  And by the way, that's the
[1484.78s -> 1486.78s]  rare, that's the rare Pog.
[1486.78s -> 1488.78s]  What are they called? Pog with Pops?
[1488.78s -> 1490.78s]  That's the rare Pog.
[1490.78s -> 1492.78s]  That's Slimer with the hot dogs in his mouth. That thing's worth like
[1492.78s -> 1495.53s]  $400.
[1495.53s -> 1497.53s]  I bought it for $500, but I thought
[1497.53s -> 1499.53s]  it was going to keep appreciating, and it didn't. It went down in price a little bit,
[1499.53s -> 1501.53s]  but it's still worth $400.
[1501.53s -> 1508.31s]  Nice apartment, man.
[1508.31s -> 1511.58s]  Hold on. What?
[1511.58s -> 1513.58s]  OK, you make me
[1513.58s -> 1515.58s]  want to get one of these.
[1515.58s -> 1517.58s]  You make me want to get one of these.
[1517.58s -> 1519.58s]  I think I want to get one of these. That would be so stupid.
[1519.58s -> 1521.58s]  Imagine having like a Pepsi
[1521.58s -> 1523.58s]  fucking vending machine in your office.
[1523.58s -> 1526.20s]  That would be so annoying.
[1526.20s -> 1528.20s]  And I would pay it.
[1528.20s -> 1530.20s]  I would put money in it and shit.
[1530.20s -> 1545.93s]  That's so small.
[1545.93s -> 1547.93s]  I'm going to get one of those. I'm going to get like an old
[1547.93s -> 1549.93s]  Pepsi machine where I have to put money in and press the button
[1549.93s -> 1554.86s]  and it's wicked loud.
[1554.86s -> 1556.86s]  And I'm sorry, a Gumby sofa?
[1556.86s -> 1559.80s]  You wouldn't have a Gumby sofa in your
[1559.80s -> 1561.80s]  house? What's wrong with you?
[1561.80s -> 1563.98s]  Why? Why would you not
[1563.98s -> 1566.15s]  want a gum? I don't care if you're
[1566.15s -> 1568.15s]  12 or 80.
[1568.15s -> 1577.50s]  That's fucking awesome.
[1577.50s -> 1581.14s]  Alright, if
[1581.14s -> 1583.14s]  you're 35 and you still get
[1583.14s -> 1585.14s]  to play Pokemon, then I get to be
[1585.14s -> 1587.14s]  35 and have a Qbert Puck, OK?
[1587.14s -> 1590.09s]  You know, that's how it works.
[1590.09s -> 1597.26s]  None of us are doing it. Yes, you are.
[1597.26s -> 1604.17s]  Alright, another
[1604.17s -> 1606.17s]  fucking huge amount of money just came in.
[1606.17s -> 1609.94s]  Guys, I haven't even done the first part
[1609.94s -> 1614.55s]  of the tutorial in the Hulk.
[1614.55s -> 1616.55s]  Thank you, Egg Scramble. They say
[1616.55s -> 1618.55s]  that's $50 from Egg Scramble.
[1618.55s -> 1620.55s]  Mmm, yummy bits, yum please.
[1620.55s -> 1622.55s]  Pass the parmesan. Parmesan in eggs
[1622.55s -> 1624.55s]  is actually really, really good.
[1624.55s -> 1626.55s]  You take the eggs, beat up your eggs.
[1626.55s -> 1628.55s]  Like three or four of them.
[1628.55s -> 1630.55s]  Add some pepper.
[1630.55s -> 1632.55s]  Add a splash of milk and put in
[1632.55s -> 1634.55s]  a bunch of parmesan cheese.
[1634.55s -> 1639.66s]  Go...
[1639.66s -> 1641.66s]  until they're nice and smooth and then
[1641.66s -> 1643.66s]  make scrambled eggs. They're delicious.
[1643.66s -> 1650.12s]  Trust me. If you don't believe me,
[1650.12s -> 1652.12s]  try it once and then don't ever do it again,
[1652.12s -> 1654.74s]  but then I'll be right. It's OK.
[1654.74s -> 1656.74s]  Anyways, thanks for the $50. Thanks for the $50
[1656.74s -> 1658.74s]  fucking dollars from Filactory Lich.
[1658.74s -> 1660.92s]  5,000 bits.
[1660.92s -> 1662.92s]  This is an R
[1662.92s -> 1664.92s]  slash male living space.
[1664.92s -> 1666.92s]  Burn those Funko Pops.
[1666.92s -> 1670.12s]  That's the only ones I have.
[1670.12s -> 1672.12s]  What do you mean burn those Funko Pops?
[1672.12s -> 1674.12s]  Roger Rabbit, that's a fucking rare one.
[1674.12s -> 1676.12s]  You can't even buy that one anymore.
[1676.12s -> 1678.12s]  I knew I shouldn't have fucking shown you these.
[1678.12s -> 1680.12s]  I have four Funko Pops.
[1680.12s -> 1682.12s]  Oh wow, I don't have a fucking
[1682.12s -> 1684.12s]  closet full of these things.
[1684.12s -> 1686.12s]  I don't have like 300 of them.
[1686.12s -> 1688.12s]  They're just like, they were like, OK, over the last
[1688.12s -> 1690.12s]  like six years, I've gotten
[1690.12s -> 1693.00s]  four.
[1693.00s -> 1695.00s]  If you have less than 10 Funko Pops,
[1695.00s -> 1697.00s]  that's fine. More than 20?
[1697.00s -> 1699.00s]  You need a space for it, and if you don't,
[1699.00s -> 1701.00s]  that's a little too much after 2030, I think
[1701.00s -> 1703.00s]  that's, you don't have, who has space for that?
[1703.00s -> 1706.52s]  I got four. I have to play
[1706.52s -> 1709.27s]  the game. Four, uh, people start
[1709.27s -> 1715.35s]  to get mad at me. Make it
[1715.35s -> 1721.18s]  zero.
[1721.18s -> 1723.18s]  Why? They're like,
[1723.18s -> 1726.63s]  they're fine.
[1726.63s -> 1731.37s]  What's this one? OK.
[1731.37s -> 1733.37s]  A series of markers will appear above the base of
[1733.37s -> 1735.37s]  OK, this is jump.
[1741.37s -> 1747.37s]  Cool.
[1747.37s -> 1749.37s]  OK, yeah, so you can jump.
[1749.37s -> 1751.37s]  Jumping is cool. Jumping works.
[1751.37s -> 1760.39s]  There we go.
[1760.39s -> 1762.39s]  That's his primary ability?
[1762.39s -> 1764.39s]  I mean, is it? I guess.
[1764.39s -> 1770.98s]  Is this a cow?
[1770.98s -> 1772.98s]  Why is he making like,
[1772.98s -> 1775.22s]  you know, find somebody
[1775.22s -> 1777.22s]  that can make a good cow noise?
[1777.22s -> 1779.72s]  He can't. It's really hard
[1779.72s -> 1782.02s]  to do that. Everybody
[1782.02s -> 1784.02s]  always does that.
[1784.02s -> 1786.02s]  No.
[1786.02s -> 1788.02s]  Dude, a cow actually goes like
[1788.02s -> 1790.02s]  nobody
[1790.02s -> 1792.39s]  can do it.
[1792.39s -> 1803.02s]  It doesn't go moo.
[1803.02s -> 1805.02s]  It's a white stain in your office.
[1805.02s -> 1815.13s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[1815.13s -> 1817.56s]  Yeah, you can charge. Charge.
[1817.56s -> 1819.56s]  Did I get all the markers?
[1819.56s -> 1824.41s]  Final tutorial incoming.
[1824.41s -> 1826.41s]  Germon face can't be light. What the fuck is this?
[1826.41s -> 1828.41s]  It's grow time.
[1828.41s -> 1830.41s]  Grow time. Grow time.
[1830.41s -> 1834.50s]  Grow time.
[1834.50s -> 1839.22s]  What the hell is this?
[1839.22s -> 1841.22s]  Why is this so high quality?
[1841.22s -> 1862.86s]  Are you going to go on a rant yet?
[1862.86s -> 1864.86s]  No.
[1864.86s -> 1866.86s]  All right. Half of you guys want me to go off on a fucking rant.
[1866.86s -> 1868.86s]  And the other half want to see Hulk
[1868.86s -> 1870.86s]  Ultimate Destruction.
[1870.86s -> 1877.38s]  No, I'm going to play.
[1877.38s -> 1880.71s]  Two of sixty comic books.
[1880.71s -> 1883.66s]  Oh, cool. Extras.
[1883.66s -> 1886.34s]  What's the last thing that it wants me to know?
[1886.34s -> 1888.34s]  Hulk can climb and run up walls.
[1888.34s -> 1893.14s]  Oh, he can run up walls. I didn't know that.
[1893.14s -> 1895.14s]  Run up walls. Good thing I didn't.
[1895.14s -> 1897.14s]  Press and hold the grab button to approximate Hulk's
[1897.14s -> 1899.14s]  ability to climb sheer surfaces.
[1899.14s -> 1901.14s]  Try it now.
[1901.14s -> 1903.38s]  Do I have to hold
[1903.38s -> 1905.38s]  the whole time? No, I don't.
[1905.38s -> 1907.69s]  Holy shit, this is actually kind of cool.
[1907.69s -> 1909.69s]  This is like a Spider-Man ability.
[1909.69s -> 1914.87s]  All right, let's go. Time to play the game.
[1914.87s -> 1920.25s]  It's only been thirty minutes, guys.
[1920.25s -> 1922.25s]  Germa, get more funk. You already ranted
[1922.25s -> 1924.25s]  about Funko Pops.
[1924.25s -> 1926.55s]  You can run. Oh, God.
[1926.55s -> 1933.08s]  It's kind of hard to control.
[1933.08s -> 1939.61s]  Was it Sick Hulk?
[1939.61s -> 1944.54s]  Don't say cool, say Pog instead.
[1944.54s -> 1948.57s]  No, I'm thirty-five.
[1948.57s -> 1952.66s]  You might be like under
[1952.66s -> 1954.66s]  the age of thirty or twenty-five or something, and that's
[1954.66s -> 1956.66s]  like fine, but my generation says cool
[1956.66s -> 1958.84s]  or sick.
[1958.84s -> 1960.84s]  Pog. Right? No, I get it.
[1960.84s -> 1963.40s]  Pick up a missile pack
[1963.40s -> 1965.40s]  from the roof of the building.
[1965.40s -> 1970.90s]  Missile pack?
[1970.90s -> 1974.04s]  And then weaponize it.
[1974.04s -> 1977.30s]  Wait, I
[1977.30s -> 1985.75s]  This is so stupid.
[1985.75s -> 1992.09s]  Why don't I just shoot?
[1992.09s -> 1994.09s]  Just use it as a rocket launcher.
[1994.09s -> 1996.09s]  Oh, because I have to, I get it.
[1996.09s -> 1998.33s]  I was going to say, why am I not just using it like
[1998.33s -> 2003.00s]  shooting it out of my shoulder?
[2003.00s -> 2008.18s]  Hulk's ability to apply his incredible
[2008.18s -> 2010.18s]  strength to create new powerful weapons.
[2010.18s -> 2012.18s]  Spend your smash points to unlock the many
[2012.18s -> 2014.18s]  and varied weapons. Cool. All right, let's go.
[2014.18s -> 2021.29s]  I'm done. Smash? Okay,
[2021.29s -> 2023.29s]  this grow time thing is over here. What is that even
[2023.29s -> 2025.29s]  from? Is that like a Fruit of the Loom
[2025.29s -> 2030.22s]  commercial?
[2030.22s -> 2033.54s]  They've unlocked a cheat code.
[2033.54s -> 2036.30s]  Hulk Canada.
[2036.30s -> 2038.30s]  Once Hulk has acquired an object,
[2038.30s -> 2040.30s]  the creature will frequently manipulate
[2040.30s -> 2042.30s]  it to fashion a makeshift weapon.
[2042.30s -> 2044.30s]  Such as a missile.
[2044.30s -> 2046.30s]  If Hulk uses B to grapple an enemy if his size
[2046.30s -> 2048.30s]  are smaller, using B again will throw him.
[2048.30s -> 2050.60s]  Or battering ram.
[2050.60s -> 2052.60s]  A favorite ploy, often referred
[2052.60s -> 2054.60s]  to as the steel fist technique,
[2054.60s -> 2056.60s]  is to turn a vehicle into a
[2056.60s -> 2058.60s]  pair of metal gauntlets.
[2058.60s -> 2060.60s]  Press the special button
[2060.60s -> 2062.60s]  to demonstrate this weaponization.
[2062.60s -> 2064.60s]  Wait, I can grab a...
[2064.60s -> 2070.42s]  I need a car.
[2070.42s -> 2073.43s]  Weaponize it. Weaponize this.
[2073.43s -> 2076.06s]  Oh, this is not technically
[2076.06s -> 2078.81s]  not a car.
[2078.81s -> 2084.63s]  I need a car. I feel like this game is gonna be
[2084.63s -> 2086.63s]  a blast.
[2086.63s -> 2089.26s]  Is this a car? No, it's also like a
[2089.26s -> 2091.75s]  truck. Is it only trucks?
[2091.75s -> 2094.74s]  Okay.
[2094.74s -> 2099.16s]  There we go. They're the Hulk hands.
[2099.16s -> 2101.16s]  Actual Hulk hands.
[2101.16s -> 2104.55s]  Why does Hulk need
[2104.55s -> 2108.01s]  Hulk hands? That doesn't make any
[2108.01s -> 2119.40s]  sense. All right, let's go. I'm out.
[2119.40s -> 2127.21s]  Is to make you stronger.
[2127.21s -> 2132.20s]  All right, I'm starting to get the feel for that one.
[2132.20s -> 2137.00s]  We found comic book four.
[2137.00s -> 2140.52s]  It's a movie. Speaking of movies,
[2140.52s -> 2142.52s]  here comes a cutscene. It's been 40 minutes.
[2142.52s -> 2145.91s]  Return to the bug menu.
[2145.91s -> 2147.91s]  Save. Hard
[2147.91s -> 2151.56s]  Xbox hard disk. All right,
[2151.56s -> 2160.33s]  should we... Let's go. Oh, by the way,
[2160.33s -> 2162.33s]  how's the internet? Hey, how's
[2162.33s -> 2165.98s]  the internet?
[2165.98s -> 2168.47s]  We good? Cool.
[2168.47s -> 2171.16s]  Those of you that don't know,
[2171.16s -> 2173.34s]  I'm going to link the fucking
[2173.34s -> 2176.86s]  Giazio. We got fucking
[2176.86s -> 2179.42s]  fiber.
[2179.42s -> 2181.42s]  That's right. We're on fiber now, folks.
[2181.42s -> 2185.51s]  I've been trying
[2185.51s -> 2187.51s]  to get fiber for five years. I finally
[2187.51s -> 2189.51s]  fucking have it.
[2189.51s -> 2196.55s]  Out getting some fresh air.
[2196.55s -> 2204.30s]  Bruce, he's requisitioned half the men and supplies
[2204.30s -> 2212.74s]  in the bay.
[2212.74s -> 2214.74s]  If I came into town, everyone would be
[2214.74s -> 2216.74s]  in danger. He's better looking than me.
[2216.74s -> 2218.74s]  I'm urging you to reconsider.
[2218.74s -> 2223.99s]  Your health's deteriorating.
[2223.99s -> 2225.99s]  I'm going to attack on Titan's stomach.
[2225.99s -> 2228.42s]  And pull his hairline back
[2228.42s -> 2230.42s]  or tent it like maybe
[2230.42s -> 2232.42s]  a half an inch.
[2232.42s -> 2234.60s]  Make him back long
[2234.60s -> 2238.38s]  and roll his shoulders forward.
[2238.38s -> 2248.30s]  Send a warning shot his way,
[2248.30s -> 2250.30s]  General. Wait, he's in there?
[2250.30s -> 2252.66s]  I want him to get the point.
[2252.66s -> 2254.66s]  Why does he feel like a Gmod map?
[2254.66s -> 2256.66s]  We'd give away our position.
[2256.66s -> 2259.03s]  This is a Gmod horror
[2259.03s -> 2261.66s]  map.
[2261.66s -> 2266.78s]  Towards the outhouse by the west wall.
[2266.78s -> 2271.32s]  Holy shit.
[2271.32s -> 2276.50s]  Don't stand behind it.
[2276.50s -> 2278.50s]  Wait, I was
[2278.50s -> 2284.70s]  in there?
[2284.70s -> 2286.70s]  That's a small little shack.
[2286.70s -> 2290.34s]  Get to the jump marker and use
[2290.34s -> 2299.75s]  it to escape. Let's go.
[2299.75s -> 2309.86s]  Whenever an enemy is defeated, you get smash
[2309.86s -> 2312.74s]  points. Power-ups are also
[2312.74s -> 2314.74s]  spawned. Wait, you collect these?
[2314.74s -> 2318.20s]  Power-ups are also spawned. Do I have to
[2318.20s -> 2320.70s]  collect them?
[2320.70s -> 2322.70s]  Collected a power-up. Keep track of Hulk's health
[2322.70s -> 2329.42s]  using power meter.
[2329.42s -> 2331.42s]  You can move much more quickly by using R to
[2331.42s -> 2333.42s]  make Hulk run.
[2333.42s -> 2335.42s]  Maximum speed can be attained by pulling and holding
[2335.42s -> 2337.42s]  down R rather than tapping it.
[2340.17s -> 2342.47s]  Can I get a tree?
[2342.47s -> 2351.10s]  That was kind of dumb.
[2351.10s -> 2353.10s]  General, wait, I'm getting food. Well, hurry up.
[2353.10s -> 2355.10s]  Don't hurry up.
[2355.10s -> 2357.85s]  Slow down.
[2360.60s -> 2366.30s]  Get it slow. Don't rush.
[2366.30s -> 2370.57s]  Pause the game.
[2370.57s -> 2378.44s]  What? What the fuck? Pause?
[2378.44s -> 2382.73s]  Do you know how fast
[2382.73s -> 2384.73s]  it takes to heat up even like a bowl
[2384.73s -> 2386.73s]  of EZ-Mac? It's like at least three or four
[2386.73s -> 2388.73s]  minutes. No, we don't have time for that.
[2388.73s -> 2394.73s]  Get to the jump marker.
[2396.73s -> 2401.45s]  There we go. Nice.
[2401.45s -> 2403.82s]  This runs through people.
[2403.82s -> 2406.63s]  Why even
[2406.63s -> 2408.63s]  wait, no, no, I want the power points, right?
[2408.63s -> 2414.07s]  As an alternative to throwing,
[2414.07s -> 2416.07s]  use X while Hulk is an enemy to do
[2416.07s -> 2419.72s]  an attack on them. Cool.
[2419.72s -> 2422.54s]  Cool.
[2422.54s -> 2426.12s]  Well, now you're dead.
[2426.12s -> 2428.49s]  I actually have to run into the
[2428.49s -> 2436.42s]  power points, don't I? Just pick up the
[2436.42s -> 2442.25s]  tank and throw it.
[2442.25s -> 2444.25s]  Certain enemies are armored. Uncharged
[2444.25s -> 2446.25s]  attacks will not damage an armored opponent.
[2446.25s -> 2448.25s]  You must charge your attacks to be able to damage
[2448.25s -> 2450.25s]  armored opponents. Tanks are always armored.
[2450.25s -> 2459.53s]  Why is this moving so fast?
[2459.53s -> 2465.10s]  What?
[2465.10s -> 2470.97s]  What?
[2470.97s -> 2481.53s]  Where, where, where, where, where?
[2481.53s -> 2488.50s]  Did I catch the missiles?
[2488.50s -> 2496.06s]  Why? There's like too much
[2496.06s -> 2499.19s]  I can?
[2499.19s -> 2501.19s]  I'm going to catch a missile.
[2501.19s -> 2503.62s]  I'll try.
[2503.62s -> 2507.46s]  What the fuck is happening?
[2507.46s -> 2511.94s]  I just feel like I'm playing on
[2511.94s -> 2513.94s]  Battlefield 64
[2513.94s -> 2515.94s]  versus 64.
[2515.94s -> 2519.14s]  Catch it. Oh, there's the tanks.
[2519.14s -> 2527.66s]  I'm going to die.
[2527.66s -> 2538.54s]  He's bad. I mean,
[2538.54s -> 2540.54s]  I guess. Can I throw these?
[2540.54s -> 2542.54s]  Don't stay initially explosive.
[2542.54s -> 2553.54s]  Nice. Wait, I can get power.
[2553.54s -> 2560.46s]  Just throw shit. The movement's actually
[2560.46s -> 2562.46s]  pretty fucking fluid, right?
[2562.46s -> 2569.94s]  No, I don't want to throw it at you.
[2569.94s -> 2574.74s]  Alright, I'm just going to run.
[2574.74s -> 2578.07s]  Who cares?
[2578.07s -> 2581.66s]  No, I have to kill one tank. No, I don't.
[2581.66s -> 2583.66s]  Who cares?
[2583.66s -> 2589.80s]  It doesn't matter. I just have to go.
[2589.80s -> 2598.44s]  What happened?
[2598.44s -> 2600.44s]  You're dying to tanks. Yeah, because Tay is strong.
[2600.44s -> 2610.04s]  Why are they getting health?
[2610.04s -> 2612.66s]  I got it. Oh, good. Power up.
[2612.66s -> 2621.16s]  There we go. I know what it is. I know what it is.
[2621.16s -> 2623.16s]  I've been trying to figure it out. I've been trying to find out
[2623.16s -> 2625.16s]  what the fucking sound is that Hulk is making
[2625.16s -> 2627.16s]  over and over again, and I haven't said
[2627.16s -> 2629.16s]  anything about it because I didn't want to fuck up the scream.
[2629.16s -> 2631.16s]  It's Diablo 2
[2631.16s -> 2633.16s]  Diablo boss sounds when you attack
[2633.16s -> 2635.16s]  Diablo.
[2635.16s -> 2637.16s]  They're like...
[2637.16s -> 2639.16s]  I've just been waiting to
[2639.16s -> 2642.49s]  figure it out. I figured it out.
[2642.49s -> 2644.49s]  When the Hulk's power reaches critical mass, his rage feeds
[2644.49s -> 2647.56s]  his strength. Later, you'll be able to
[2647.56s -> 2649.56s]  buy some devastating special attacks that are
[2649.56s -> 2652.06s]  fueled by your critical mass.
[2652.06s -> 2654.06s]  Alright, so am I at critical
[2654.06s -> 2656.06s]  mass?
[2656.06s -> 2668.09s]  I like that one the best.
[2668.09s -> 2670.09s]  Let's go.
[2670.09s -> 2673.86s]  Stop. No, it's called Hulk
[2673.86s -> 2675.86s]  Ultimate Destruction.
[2675.86s -> 2677.86s]  Not Hulk Be Gentle.
[2677.86s -> 2680.23s]  Well, that would be pretty fun.
[2680.23s -> 2682.23s]  That would be kind of a fun game, don't you think?
[2682.23s -> 2684.23s]  Where the fuck am I going?
[2684.23s -> 2691.96s]  What the fuck is going on?
[2691.96s -> 2701.18s]  I made it to the drop zone.
[2701.18s -> 2710.14s]  Let's go. I'm at critical mass.
[2710.14s -> 2713.78s]  Why do I have to power up? Okay, I get it.
[2713.78s -> 2719.48s]  Another $50.
[2719.48s -> 2723.19s]  Holy shit.
[2723.19s -> 2725.82s]  So much money.
[2748.10s -> 2750.10s]  Noooo!
[2750.10s -> 2752.10s]  No, doesn't he become other Hulk?
[2754.10s -> 2756.54s]  Yeah, he turns into Hulk
[2756.54s -> 2758.54s]  other Hulk.
[2758.54s -> 2760.54s]  Orange Hulk, right?
[2760.54s -> 2762.54s]  Whatever his name is.
[2762.54s -> 2765.03s]  Abominable Snowman.
[2765.03s -> 2767.03s]  Mega Agro gave $5,000.
[2767.03s -> 2769.40s]  That's $50.
[2769.40s -> 2771.40s]  That's a lot of fucking money.
[2771.40s -> 2773.40s]  Don't listen to chat. Your office looks comfy.
[2773.40s -> 2775.40s]  And I hope the rest of the place is too.
[2775.40s -> 2777.40s]  Long time fan since 2013. Yadda yadda yadda.
[2777.40s -> 2779.40s]  I love ya.
[2779.40s -> 2781.40s]  I also hope Otto feels better. He's a good boy.
[2781.40s -> 2783.40s]  I wasn't just skipping that. That was in the message.
[2783.40s -> 2785.40s]  That's not me being rude.
[2785.40s -> 2787.40s]  That's in the message.
[2787.40s -> 2789.40s]  I appreciate that. Thank you.
[2789.40s -> 2791.40s]  It is comfy.
[2806.01s -> 2808.01s]  Does the Hulk not have nipples?
[2827.30s -> 2829.30s]  I don't understand the jean shorts, by the way.
[2833.30s -> 2835.30s]  Why wouldn't you just wear like Spandex?
[2835.30s -> 2837.30s]  Like really stretchy Spandex underwear.
[2837.30s -> 2839.30s]  And that's it.
[2845.30s -> 2850.87s]  Why do I have to do VR?
[2850.87s -> 2862.07s]  Hulk Ultimate Destruction.
[2862.07s -> 2864.07s]  Is it just like VR?
[2864.07s -> 2866.07s]  Or do I actually do Ultimate Destruction?
[2875.37s -> 2895.61s]  Banner's remaining hope for a cure for his affliction, a machine designed to delve into his psyche, by all the beast within, has been left in ruins as a result of the attack.
[2895.61s -> 2897.61s]  Good job on the fucking teleprompter, idiot!
[2897.61s -> 2899.61s]  Thanks a lot.
[2899.61s -> 2901.61s]  Now that Banner has-
[2901.61s -> 2903.61s]  Fucking dumbass.
[2903.61s -> 2907.02s]  Adversary a former NSA operative named
[2907.90s -> 2909.02s]  Milblonsky
[2909.02s -> 2911.54s]  Is it taking a joint who cares?
[2911.54s -> 2913.46s]  Everyone knows what the fucking Hulk is the Hulk like
[2914.98s -> 2921.82s]  Radiated guy and there's another guy that wants to be radiated in strong 2 and he's huge and he can fucking punch through walls
[2921.82s -> 2923.66s]  You don't need to know anything else
[2923.66s -> 2932.45s]  Like what else do you need to know about the whole of a handheld neural interface?
[2932.81s -> 2937.21s]  It can perform read or write operations directly into a patient's mind
[2937.49s -> 2942.65s]  You've read or write in fact without fucking Windows permissions mission objectives into your mind. Holy shit, man
[2943.37s -> 2945.37s]  violently transformed
[2946.25s -> 2950.48s]  Be pleasant, but it's the only chance we've got
[2951.42s -> 2961.71s]  Read or write man. I don't know. I was I didn't know I was using a CDRW fuck man. I don't care
[2962.79s -> 2976.39s]  See look, that's what I'm saying. Just wear fucking stretchy underwear
[2977.15s -> 2983.90s]  Why rip through a good pair of jean shorts when you could just wear a bathing suit?
[2984.46s -> 2990.72s]  Just get one like one or two sizes. Look Hulk's waist is not that much bigger than Bruce Banner's
[2991.28s -> 2993.11s]  what is he like a
[2993.11s -> 2995.42s]  what is Bruce like a
[2996.67s -> 2998.67s]  38 like 37
[2998.75s -> 3000.75s]  What is the Hulk like a 60?
[3001.15s -> 3006.92s]  Just get like a 50 or like a 55 and it's gonna be a little loose on Bruce
[3006.92s -> 3014.06s]  But that's alright and then when it expands he just expands into its spandex. What's I don't why where's she like jeans?
[3014.62s -> 3029.43s]  It's a fast travel. Wait, there's a super fast jump to city
[3033.42s -> 3036.39s]  All right, the till boat brand hotel
[3037.03s -> 3045.72s]  You can't do this
[3046.00s -> 3057.79s]  World
[3057.79s -> 3062.49s]  Batman music that's pretty cool. This is an objective defeat the police resistance. What?
[3063.55s -> 3084.28s]  go
[3084.28s -> 3087.78s]  Wait, this is pedestrians walking around right now
[3088.78s -> 3090.78s]  Why would you walk around right now?
[3091.30s -> 3095.30s]  Come here. Hey, you're green me too. We're now best friend
[3096.80s -> 3120.25s]  Hulk is bouncing off. Do you got to watch out? Hope Hulk is really pop it off right now
[3131.81s -> 3137.63s]  What was that? Sorry
[3141.17s -> 3147.58s]  I'll never understand this shit man. They always do this in like movies and TV shows and
[3148.22s -> 3150.99s]  Freeze, that's it hands in the air
[3151.99s -> 3158.15s]  This is a fucking alien mutant person that is that can kill you in one punch and no bullets work
[3158.15s -> 3165.12s]  I don't think they're going to freeze and put their hands up that we continue to see this in media
[3165.84s -> 3175.22s]  The nine millimeter is not gonna work against the guy that can literally pick up a car and throw it into it and it explode
[3175.22s -> 3177.22s]  Into another car and without any problem
[3178.38s -> 3180.38s]  media
[3181.66s -> 3185.36s]  Like you don't tell this guy holding the giant fucking ball
[3186.02s -> 3191.99s]  Put that ball down and then you go like
[3193.47s -> 3198.18s]  It's not gonna do anything. What you should have just not done that
[3212.72s -> 3214.72s]  Okay that car
[3224.31s -> 3228.79s]  Car humping another car. Okay, that's that's just
[3230.95s -> 3238.36s]  Oh
[3238.36s -> 3244.96s]  Yes. Yes, they fit in this one, too. It's in this one, too. They just drive into stuff. I'm so happy
[3244.96s -> 3252.56s]  Why was this one better than the last one? Oh, is this one a better game?
[3255.76s -> 3257.44s]  You're getting away
[3257.44s -> 3263.76s]  This one's just the same game except a little bit better frame rate and not based on Edward North

[5199.15s -> 5201.15s]  Okay, that was
[5201.68s -> 5209.05s]  Why did I even need to do that activate the jump marker?
[5209.93s -> 5215.69s]  How big do you think hulk's shits are?
[5216.80s -> 5217.92s]  um
[5217.92s -> 5219.92s]  I have a better question for you
[5220.00s -> 5222.00s]  This is the questions that people don't ask
[5222.48s -> 5224.65s]  so if hulk
[5224.65s -> 5226.65s]  eats five pizzas
[5227.05s -> 5234.92s]  When he turns back into bruce banner do those five pizzas still sit inside of bruce banner and does he take the mega shit?
[5235.16s -> 5245.44s]  You know what i'm saying?
[5245.44s -> 5247.44s]  if the hulk drinks
[5247.93s -> 5251.45s]  Five gallons of liquid because of the hulk and these you gotta stay hydrated
[5252.33s -> 5259.18s]  And then he gets really really happy. What happens to that pee?
[5259.82s -> 5262.38s]  Let's just say come out of him like spongebob
[5263.08s -> 5265.24s]  You know like the spongebob square
[5266.28s -> 5269.96s]  And like the water comes all out of him and shit like is that gonna happen would that happen to you
[5269.96s -> 5278.27s]  Would come out of like his skin what why is this such a fucked up thing to ask?
[5279.07s -> 5281.50s]  What you never thought about this in your whole life
[5282.49s -> 5284.89s]  If you have a guy that's 12 feet tall and can eat like
[5286.14s -> 5288.14s]  20 pounds of meat in one sitting
[5288.62s -> 5294.78s]  When he turns back into bruce that's gotta go somewhere. It's gonna come out his eyes like the play-doh toy
[5296.96s -> 5298.40s]  like the spaghetti
[5298.40s -> 5300.80s]  my play-doh spaghetti toy with like the
[5301.92s -> 5308.99s]  Apparently that makes me a fucked up person to bring this up. I guess
[5309.15s -> 5316.80s]  Yes
[5316.80s -> 5324.83s]  Protect and serve one two three
[5330.52s -> 5332.52s]  That was awful. Hi
[5335.20s -> 5337.04s]  guys, there was like a
[5337.04s -> 5341.76s]  Shitty little meme on this channel for like a couple of days about somebody talking about
[5342.80s -> 5345.14s]  Shit and you all thought it was hysterical
[5346.08s -> 5350.88s]  A specific copy and paste shit thing everybody thought was the funniest thing in the world
[5350.88s -> 5353.52s]  But I talk about bruce bannard. You need to go to the bathroom after eating
[5354.16s -> 5356.80s]  12 hamburgers at the hulk and i'm the psychopath
[5357.60s -> 5370.04s]  I don't have any I don't have to move on long. Oh, well, where is this?
[5370.92s -> 5378.92s]  To a challenge fast movers six run through the course as fast as bugging to do this. This can be bad
[5379.48s -> 5385.95s]  This is gonna be real bad. We hold you to a higher standard
[5388.16s -> 5390.24s]  You shouldn't that's your biggest mistake
[5391.28s -> 5397.80s]  So where where where's this race?
[5398.76s -> 5406.84s]  Right here. Ah
[5406.84s -> 5410.36s]  What what kind of kind of track was this?
[5411.24s -> 5413.96s]  Okay, uh that didn't follow any logic at all
[5431.29s -> 5432.51s]  don't jump
[5432.51s -> 5434.89s]  Hit it
[5434.89s -> 5437.90s]  silva
[5437.90s -> 5439.02s]  Ah
[5439.02s -> 5441.26s]  I told you I was gonna fix this and I didn't fix it
[5441.58s -> 5447.95s]  If hulk eats a person and then turns back into bruce bannard does banner still have to digest the person hulk aid
[5449.55s -> 5459.18s]  Yes
[5459.18s -> 5461.90s]  Read it. I don't want to read it about eating right now
[5463.79s -> 5467.95s]  All right. Do I not have another story mission? Where is the story?
[5468.83s -> 5476.30s]  There ain't no story mission here. Oh there is I need to move
[5476.94s -> 5481.58s]  Fuck I need that. I need a new move. All right. I need to buy go back to the church
[5482.62s -> 5484.62s]  What moves do I need air?
[5495.29s -> 5499.71s]  Air recovery, okay. I gotta just go this way
[5500.59s -> 5520.36s]  Honey over here get it. And why am I illiterate? Look at the link. I already did
[5524.01s -> 5529.69s]  Shit in a blt sandwich and nobody bats and I talked about bruce banner's monster shits and everyone loses their money
[5531.31s -> 5532.43s]  Yes
[5532.43s -> 5534.19s]  exactly
[5534.19s -> 5538.03s]  You know when people just get maybe we just get you
[5539.07s -> 5542.08s]  You know when people just get you
[5542.88s -> 5547.84s]  This is one of those scary
[5547.84s -> 5549.84s]  And by the way, how the fuck are you guys?
[5551.16s -> 5560.75s]  All right. All right. I gotta buy air recovery. This game is
[5561.71s -> 5563.47s]  fucking awful
[5563.47s -> 5573.68s]  Kidding kidding kidding kidding kidding kidding kidding kidding kidding air recovery. I don't even know how to do it
[5574.00s -> 5579.40s]  Recover instantly from any attack that floats hulk into the air. This is important
[5580.36s -> 5587.32s]  Okay, how about dashing straight high speed attack great for clearing just about anything
[5589.40s -> 5598.84s]  All right, we need double fist tossed is a mission thing for a while on the move. Yeah
[5599.56s -> 5606.24s]  Okay, 25 000 for this. Why do I feel like all these moves?
[5606.56s -> 5610.72s]  I feel like I got them all so early. I just bought them all i've done two missions
[5611.60s -> 5624.86s]  There are more sick. There's a fuckload more
[5625.58s -> 5627.58s]  You don't have to say the f word
[5627.74s -> 5629.58s]  Why would you say the f word?
[5629.58s -> 5631.58s]  It's like kind of rude and shit
[5632.22s -> 5638.81s]  It's the part where I say too much to the f word. No swearing here. Fucking idiot. Like I say fuck
[5639.69s -> 5644.01s]  You know what I mean? Like I think don't say that and then I say it and then everybody laughs
[5644.73s -> 5651.13s]  Is it guys this streamer is kind of toxic?
[5653.71s -> 5658.51s]  And then that's when I go i'm not toxic. What are you talking about? We just have fun here
[5659.71s -> 5663.63s]  Just chill. We're having a good time and then I say you fucking idiot. Oh
[5664.91s -> 5666.11s]  Ha ha ha
[5666.11s -> 5680.94s]  Why didn't I grab?
[5680.94s -> 5693.26s]  Grab it
[5693.26s -> 5695.74s]  Eat the giant hamburger. You can't I already tried
[5700.28s -> 5705.47s]  Wait, I'll try the new move
[5705.79s -> 5709.15s]  Holy shit, my whole body is like shaking right now. How cool that was
[5712.78s -> 5715.50s]  All right. Here we go
[5715.50s -> 5721.58s]  We have a target of opportunity. I've hacked a lab computer at a division research facility, which is illegal very
[5721.90s -> 5725.42s]  I just tripped a fail safe. So blonsky knows i'm inside
[5725.66s -> 5728.94s]  He'll destroy the entire place before he allows the download to complete
[5729.18s -> 5735.18s]  You're asking me to run protection while you loot the network six or seven minutes. That's all I need seven seven minutes
[5736.46s -> 5739.58s]  Seven minutes is all I need to destroy bio research center
[5740.14s -> 5744.06s]  Defend the bio research center until the data downloads. What kind of connection do you have?
[5746.04s -> 5752.11s]  So oh I need data so you're downloading protect. It's probably text right how much data is on there
[5752.59s -> 5754.75s]  if you need to wait 10 minutes to download like
[5755.71s -> 5757.71s]  Three to four thousand k of stuff
[5758.62s -> 5765.40s]  Get another fucking service provider get another computer. I can I could I recommend fiber internet to you i'm on it
[5765.96s -> 5770.92s]  This is 2004. Oh shit. It was
[5771.48s -> 5773.40s]  Wait average
[5773.40s -> 5777.04s]  That's broad a broadband existed in 2000 average
[5778.82s -> 5780.82s]  internet speeds
[5781.00s -> 5784.20s]  in 2004
[5784.20s -> 5786.03s]  oh
[5786.03s -> 5788.25s]  uh
[5788.25s -> 5791.31s]  2000k is what the average was
[5791.31s -> 5793.31s]  This
[5794.80s -> 5801.16s]  Fuck how is that so spot on the average cable is 21 78
[5801.78s -> 5803.53s]  avps
[5803.53s -> 5817.69s]  Okay. Well, that's accurate then we're still on wi-fi. Am I on that or am I on ometer? Which one? I don't know. I'm not sure
[5824.41s -> 5825.61s]  Uh-huh
[5825.61s -> 5830.99s]  Three and a half. I thought whatever happened seven minutes. That was an incredibly wrong estimate
[5832.99s -> 5836.43s]  Hope this is gonna take you seven minutes to do just getting three minutes and 30 seconds
[5837.87s -> 5846.35s]  See the target
[5846.35s -> 5854.28s]  Get out of here
[5854.28s -> 5859.12s]  Oh, yes
[5859.12s -> 5861.44s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait running running crap
[5863.72s -> 5866.92s]  I love the wind up
[5866.92s -> 5868.92s]  Backhand is back in
[5869.08s -> 5870.84s]  123
[5870.84s -> 5877.44s]  Wait destroyed
[5877.44s -> 5883.76s]  Where this tank?
[5883.76s -> 5885.76s]  critical massachew good
[5885.76s -> 5894.09s]  Try this shit get rid of this tank. Come on kick it
[5896.86s -> 5898.86s]  How many tanks are here?
[5900.17s -> 5902.17s]  Dude, how many stars do I have?
[5903.18s -> 5906.46s]  This shit didn't even happen in gta. Oh, maybe one would come down the road
[5912.14s -> 5918.48s]  Do we take
[5922.36s -> 5926.27s]  Two more minutes
[5926.27s -> 5930.14s]  dead
[5930.14s -> 5936.78s]  When let's command and conquer when hulk's power gets low he experiences an adrenaline surge this increases his attack the image
[5937.34s -> 5939.34s]  Give some access to special moves
[5941.37s -> 5942.33s]  Okay
[5942.33s -> 5944.33s]  I'm an adrenaline surge
[5948.54s -> 5951.58s]  I have the hulk mod unlocked for command and conquer
[5955.23s -> 5957.07s]  There's too many
[5957.07s -> 5961.96s]  What the fuck?
[5961.96s -> 5965.18s]  Kick him
[5965.18s -> 5968.14s]  There we go. All right hunt one two hunt
[5968.86s -> 5982.97s]  That's so good
[5982.97s -> 5985.93s]  Blood. Yeah, this blood is fucking game. What do you think about it now?
[5986.81s -> 5999.93s]  Let's throw trees
[5999.93s -> 6002.25s]  Command and conquer tanks get the fuck out of here
[6016.94s -> 6029.44s]  No, please kick it kick it kick it kick it smash it do anything
[6041.42s -> 6043.42s]  Why won't you die?
[6044.14s -> 6046.62s]  Do a falcon kick. I'm I got I've got armor there right now
[6063.48s -> 6070.04s]  Mission complete do some jump cancels
[6073.26s -> 6075.26s]  Wait now I have to destroy the building
[6080.60s -> 6084.32s]  Hold on
[6087.96s -> 6090.76s]  What the hell do you mean need to know bases?
[6091.56s -> 6101.56s]  Calm down. You've commandeered the interval and established a level 15 clearance only the president senior cabinet members have that access
[6102.36s -> 6105.40s]  Surely you of all people don't need a lesson in protocol
[6106.20s -> 6108.20s]  That's what it looks like a minute of fondant
[6108.52s -> 6112.41s]  You'd be more concerned with keeping the hulk in check
[6112.97s -> 6118.33s]  You're not as clever as you think you are blonsky if I so much as imagine you're keeping anyone
[6118.41s -> 6123.21s]  But god almighty in that cell i'll find out and be on you like a dog
[6126.73s -> 6129.93s]  Oh, no, I thought he's gonna turn around and be surprised by the person behind him. No
[6129.93s -> 6134.28s]  No
[6138.06s -> 6141.74s]  Is the green goblin no
[6141.74s -> 6143.74s]  You can't kill them all
[6144.78s -> 6149.02s]  That's a green goblin scenario when you look in the mirror when you have hulk powers the green goblin talks to you
[6152.23s -> 6157.21s]  Samson captured top secret files from the mainframe you obtained from the roof of the division building
[6157.93s -> 6160.27s]  Bonsky's files contain vital division intelligence
[6160.81s -> 6165.60s]  Useful for samson and hulk in accomplishing their goal as you advance through your missions
[6166.00s -> 6170.80s]  Samson will continue to unlock these secret files and new ones will become available to you
[6171.44s -> 6175.12s]  Proceed to the church in order to read the files
[6177.37s -> 6182.80s]  Okay, that was his dnd character
[6183.44s -> 6185.61s]  Maybe I should go to the buy menu
[6185.69s -> 6189.84s]  You guys understand
[6189.84s -> 6193.84s]  I was around and I know here come like the boomer emotes and the old person emote
[6195.12s -> 6198.08s]  But I remember being on 28.8. K
[6200.70s -> 6202.86s]  That was back when if somebody picked up the telephone
[6203.66s -> 6205.66s]  Your whole your whole computer crashed
[6206.14s -> 6214.44s]  Can you imagine being in the living room on a 28.8k connection in some random chat room somewhere?
[6215.08s -> 6216.52s]  and somebody
[6216.52s -> 6218.52s]  in the upstairs
[6218.84s -> 6220.84s]  Bedroom picked up the telephone
[6221.56s -> 6226.30s]  Your computer crashed
[6226.30s -> 6228.94s]  I remember it would be like if something really important was happening
[6230.48s -> 6233.84s]  It would be like some reasons like if my father was on the computer and he's like
[6234.08s -> 6237.84s]  He would always just scream up to everybody whoever was upstairs or wherever he'd be like
[6238.32s -> 6241.76s]  All right. I got an important thing going on here. Nobody pick up a phone
[6243.02s -> 6246.14s]  And it's like oh shit. Okay. Nobody could we can't do anything
[6246.70s -> 6248.70s]  We cannot communicate with anybody
[6249.28s -> 6253.63s]  Ever for the next like probably two three four hours, but you would forget
[6254.56s -> 6257.92s]  And you would pick up a phone and it would do that
[6259.04s -> 6263.44s]  And you freak out and hang it up immediately and hope to god that it wasn't gonna fuck up the connection to fuck up the computer
[6266.75s -> 6270.00s]  And all of a sudden you would hear it would be like this be like
[6271.16s -> 6276.60s]  Oh, yeah, I gotta call uh, I gotta call mike. Yeah, I gotta talk to mike. Let me pick up the phone and
[6278.08s -> 6284.73s]  Fuck fuck fuck fuck
[6285.53s -> 6287.53s]  Fuck like a god. Damn it. It went
[6287.85s -> 6288.65s]  shit
[6288.65s -> 6290.80s]  I'm gonna pick up the phone
[6290.80s -> 6292.80s]  No, no, I no I I may have
[6293.60s -> 6295.34s]  It's like gah
[6295.34s -> 6310.27s]  That was life. Tell us more stories grandpa. I'm gonna save up for critical atomic slam
[6311.23s -> 6317.52s]  Plonsky files on samsung minimal contribution. Ouch
[6318.00s -> 6319.20s]  whatever
[6319.28s -> 6321.64s]  But I have my own file. This is worrying
[6322.28s -> 6323.56s]  I don't care
[6323.56s -> 6328.36s]  That's lore. Somebody else will read it. You took a screen to take a screenshot. You can read it later
[6329.08s -> 6336.72s]  You know that when me and burger boy used to sit in in burger boy's room and play video games all day
[6337.20s -> 6339.60s]  Every time there was that's like that's from me and burger boy
[6340.16s -> 6343.44s]  Anytime there was like something to read it was like, oh somebody else will read this and we just skipped it
[6344.00s -> 6353.28s]  For everything it didn't matter what it was if there was like a note on a table that was more than like four or five paragraphs
[6353.28s -> 6355.28s]  Long it was instantly skipped
[6360.06s -> 6362.54s]  If it was not integral to the video game
[6363.26s -> 6366.14s]  It was never read
[6366.22s -> 6374.00s]  Is that why you can't read? How did I read your comment then?
[6379.05s -> 6381.05s]  Maybe if you thought about shit before writing it
[6384.16s -> 6392.06s]  Put text to speech on I told you that I was never gonna do that
[6392.70s -> 6405.12s]  Oh gorilla
[6405.12s -> 6407.12s]  Pick up gorilla. All right, i've got gorilla
[6407.84s -> 6408.80s]  finally
[6408.80s -> 6416.92s]  This is like annoyingly in the way
[6421.84s -> 6424.32s]  Fire saver have to start putting the machine together
[6424.72s -> 6428.08s]  I'm stuck without a hydraulic lift to move the heavier parts
[6428.32s -> 6435.92s]  I need a generator for power conversion and a cat scan apparatus to get an accurate topographic image. I can deliver this shit. Okay
[6436.72s -> 6448.88s]  You gotta go on a home depot run
[6452.60s -> 6454.60s]  Oh, no, I lost the gorilla
[6455.40s -> 6459.56s]  Get the steel fists
[6467.23s -> 6469.23s]  Sucks I don't want to do this
[6473.07s -> 6475.07s]  This is pissing me off
[6475.07s -> 6479.61s]  There's no ninja turtle
[6479.69s -> 6483.58s]  Remember what ninja turtle game would come out every year?
[6484.30s -> 6485.80s]  from like
[6485.80s -> 6491.50s]  1989 to like 1999 or like 2005 or something. Where's the ninja turtles games? Yeah, what the fuck are they?
[6493.53s -> 6495.53s]  Ninja turtles games come out every single year
[6506.04s -> 6514.04s]  Across the whole city
[6531.48s -> 6543.12s]  Nice I can destroy buildings now do I need bulk hands?
[6545.72s -> 6547.72s]  This shit loud
[6550.92s -> 6552.92s]  Oh my god
[6556.32s -> 6558.32s]  You're standing on top of it. All right
[6560.43s -> 6576.19s]  What is this thing it's like a sonic the hedgehog spring dead the nintendo labo piece
[6588.30s -> 6592.88s]  Yeah, this is a nintendo labo completed construction
[6593.76s -> 6600.92s]  After using it one time. It's all bent and torn up and shit
[6602.28s -> 6608.24s]  gorilla
[6608.24s -> 6632.17s]  Wait, because they uh, he's an omen during here. Do I get this right jump to the church?

[7101.74s -> 7107.25s]  I think you severely overestimate. Um my preparedness for each stream
[7107.81s -> 7112.13s]  Usually go something like this

[14250.93s -> 14252.93s]  This looks fantastic
[14252.93s -> 14264.10s]  It's phenomenal. This is an original xbox game. This looks like it could have came out like five years ago
[14267.42s -> 14268.78s]  Well, maybe 10
[14268.78s -> 14271.09s]  10 is probably pushing it maybe like 15
[14271.73s -> 14278.64s]  Which is when it did come up. So let's just say whatever I acquire a mission
[14279.20s -> 14283.90s]  Is it what do I want to go?

[14325.57s -> 14327.17s]  lettuce tomato
[14327.17s -> 14329.01s]  Way too thick of a patty
[14329.01s -> 14332.77s]  You gotta cut that in half. I don't like big thick burgers like that. No, thank you
[14333.41s -> 14334.85s]  The lettuce underneath
[14334.85s -> 14340.08s]  I I don't think this this is just not made right
[14349.12s -> 14353.63s]  I have to say about that
[14353.63s -> 14360.91s]  Bad news blond skis developed a new funny bit buster mech. No, that's on the real criticism of a gross hamburger field tests

[20360.22s -> 20361.58s]  zombie comics
[20361.58s -> 20364.46s]  If I remember correctly hulk eats like five people
[20365.02s -> 20371.34s]  And then when he transforms back all the people's bones that weren't dissolved by the stomach acid poke through his rotting skin
[20371.82s -> 20380.38s]  Okay, now what happens if he's not a zombie will that same thing happen and will it just kill bruce banner
[20382.54s -> 20388.30s]  Like if the hulk were to eat five people and not be a zombie would when he shrinks down
[20388.62s -> 20390.30s]  Would they just poke out through?
[20390.30s -> 20393.82s]  40 parts of his body and just fucking kill him in like blood everywhere and shit

[20498.52s -> 20502.20s]  I saved it, right? Nobody reads comics
[20503.98s -> 20505.98s]  No, but talk about the ending to

[20572.71s -> 20574.71s]  Thanks for the 250 door cube 7 000
[20575.19s -> 20579.42s]  I'm almost certain someone has already suggested this but you should play prototype two
[20580.14s -> 20582.54s]  And movement mechanics and beat them up gameplay is similar to this game
[20582.54s -> 20585.02s]  I just played through recently and I might suggest playing it on hard
[20585.50s -> 20589.10s]  As once you upgrade your powers past a certain point and none of the enemies are threatening
[20589.74s -> 20592.10s]  I tried to play prototype
[20592.10s -> 20594.58s]  There was a lot of problems with it
[20594.58s -> 20596.26s]  I wanted to do them both
[20596.26s -> 20599.14s]  But I got to prototype one and it was like a bunch of frame problems
[20600.14s -> 20602.38s]  I'm, not sure what it was. I don't even remember
[20602.94s -> 20611.13s]  It's because I think I was trying to play it on pc and there was some problem with it
[20611.29s -> 20613.37s]  I would have to just play it on like xbox or something
[20613.93s -> 20619.99s]  Or on like ps4. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's something I wanted to play
[20619.99s -> 20622.07s]  I mean, I tried to stream it like a couple years ago. So

[20676.10s -> 20677.46s]  Just cancelled all together

[20974.89s -> 20979.45s]  Please dude, just let go of my diamond peter griffin comic con exclusive funko pop. Come on
[20980.41s -> 20997.43s]  That's fucking funny. Thank you. Uh, gleg gleg dali for the three dollars heard you loved no more heroes
[20997.43s -> 21002.87s]  I do you ever heard or played a killer 7 suit of 51's other most well-known game. Yes, I have
[21003.59s -> 21007.32s]  I need to beat no more heroes too before I consider playing killer 7 by the way
[21007.32s -> 21013.46s]  We need to do that soon such a good game like this. I'm not putting it off for any particular reason
[21013.54s -> 21015.54s]  I love the whole series
[21015.54s -> 21019.40s]  And I have to play the one that came out on pc. I want to play them all
[21019.96s -> 21026.73s]  Travis strikes again. Yeah, that's what i'm talking about the one for pc
[21027.21s -> 21035.16s]  But yeah, we'll cross that bridge after the other
[21035.80s -> 21039.26s]  No more heroes series
[21039.26s -> 21043.34s]  Thanks a lot boiky. Thanks for five dollars one of these days. She's just actually listened to one of the guys
[21043.90s -> 21048.46s]  One guy who said to play some random game burn off the current game and switch it and see how chat reacts
[21048.54s -> 21050.54s]  I did that. I did that with rain world
[21052.41s -> 21055.29s]  Uh, you are describing the exact scenario of rain world
[21055.85s -> 21063.42s]  It wasn't it was right. No rain. I rain world was like more than 10 people
[21064.94s -> 21067.74s]  But I did just stop what I was doing an open rain world
[21076.49s -> 21082.50s]  Yeah, I mean here's another here's another scenario that's funny that that's funnier than that
[21082.74s -> 21087.30s]  I mean like we're talking comedy for like levels the thing i'm gonna say is just funnier than what you said
[21088.10s -> 21090.66s]  um, but no, uh
[21091.94s -> 21093.14s]  It'd be funny
[21093.14s -> 21098.02s]  If I had a plant in the chat that said like oh dude like will you just fucking next already?
[21098.42s -> 21101.46s]  and like beat the fifth boss of dark souls 2
[21102.34s -> 21103.54s]  with uh
[21103.86s -> 21106.66s]  With unarmed and i'm just like, oh fucking oh, yeah
[21106.74s -> 21110.26s]  Let me just do this real quick and it's I have it queued up already and I turn it off and I go
[21110.34s -> 21111.78s]  Right to it and I do it
[21111.78s -> 21115.38s]  And i've like practiced that boss like fucking a hundred times to make sure I can do it
[21116.18s -> 21121.18s]  I already did that joke. Did I?
[21121.18s -> 21126.90s]  Maybe I did
[21126.90s -> 21130.18s]  Silent serenity. Thanks for the 250 here. Are you the guy from reddit?
[21130.50s -> 21134.18s]  I saw the photos of your collection on our funko epic stuff, dude
[21134.18s -> 21136.58s]  I hope you enjoy this gold and put it towards some more pops
[21138.42s -> 21140.98s]  I don't know what you guys deal is with people that like stuff
[21142.42s -> 21144.66s]  So, oh no or funko
[21145.46s -> 21149.70s]  I like that shit and it's fine. It's fun. It's collectibles. Who cares?
[21155.75s -> 21160.25s]  Like people owning funko pops are not going to give you hemorrhoids
[21160.87s -> 21173.48s]  You know, that's like don't it. We'll worry about it a beast of blastik. What?
[21175.02s -> 21177.02s]  He's so defensive over his funko
[21180.82s -> 21186.74s]  He's a moderator. No, i'm not and relax relax relax relax
[21187.54s -> 21189.30s]  Relax
[21189.30s -> 21191.94s]  What is a beast of blastik? I don't understand
[21196.23s -> 21201.59s]  Okay, if you're gonna say it's just a piece of plastic, I would love to see your team fortress 2 hat collection
[21202.23s -> 21211.69s]  How much do you spend on those?
[21213.13s -> 21216.01s]  A lot of those were hundreds and hundreds of dollars
[21221.38s -> 21228.26s]  I feel attacked. How many did you have? I had quite a few
[21229.88s -> 21234.01s]  Not really though. I never really had a lot of unusuals or any expensive hats
[21234.65s -> 21239.11s]  What did I I had one unusual for the demo man?
[21239.75s -> 21245.27s]  What was it?
[21245.27s -> 21250.39s]  Gibbous friend feels good man. I used to like to love if there was a especially a heavy gibbous
[21251.03s -> 21253.48s]  That was the best
[21253.48s -> 21256.44s]  It was so it was the most adorable thing ever because you just knew
[21257.40s -> 21263.32s]  Everything about that person's entire life. You know what I mean? Like if I saw a gibbous heavy, I knew everything about them
[21263.88s -> 21273.37s]  And I loved them
[21273.37s -> 21277.21s]  That was the best thing the gibbous is the one of the greatest additions to any game
[21284.22s -> 21287.74s]  You made multiple unboxing videos. You're guilty on both ends. I made like three
[21288.54s -> 21290.22s]  And after and this is like two, okay
[21290.22s -> 21296.78s]  I made like three unboxing videos in like 2012 and after the third one I was like, oh, this is kind of dumb
[21296.86s -> 21298.54s]  I don't want to do that ever again
[21298.54s -> 21307.82s]  And I didn't and I haven't
[21307.82s -> 21315.02s]  Three is multiple. Yeah, but I I made three unboxing videos because I don't know if they were popular people thought they were cool
[21315.58s -> 21318.70s]  I'm like, oh should I do these people like these people want to see this?
[21319.50s -> 21322.62s]  I guess i'll try it. I did it a couple times and it was like, oh, okay
[21323.02s -> 21325.34s]  Okay, I guess and then after the third one is just like
[21326.14s -> 21328.22s]  I don't really want to do that. I don't want to do so I want to do something else
[21328.22s -> 21329.74s]  I don't want to do that anymore
[21329.74s -> 21334.30s]  It was popular. I tried it, you know, obviously there's like something interesting people think it's cool. You want to try it
[21346.58s -> 21350.02s]  We need another gate queue
[21350.02s -> 21353.46s]  All right, let's finish up here. We still have like another probably five minutes or so
[21354.76s -> 21359.40s]  Uh, mr sneak, man. Thanks for the 250. I have a sneaky question. What's your favorite sneaker? Stay safe
[21360.38s -> 21361.98s]  Um, I like
[21361.98s -> 21363.50s]  my favorite sneaker
[21363.50s -> 21365.50s]  Uh, it would nike prestos
[21366.06s -> 21369.90s]  Best thing of ever one of my life and i'm talking nike prestos from like 1998
[21370.62s -> 21373.51s]  There you go
[21373.51s -> 21375.51s]  Autumn dragons. Thanks for the 250
[21375.67s -> 21382.73s]  Good evening king. I adore the mullet hair you have going on. Also. Do you not realize that funko pops are objectively ugly?
[21383.29s -> 21386.42s]  Here we go again
[21386.42s -> 21387.46s]  uh
[21387.46s -> 21389.70s]  And but it but it's me
[21390.66s -> 21396.10s]  Who is talking about the funko pops? No, i'm just addressing and reacting to the constant
[21396.50s -> 21401.94s]  Slander and attacks that I've had to see over the course of this five and a six hour stream
[21406.20s -> 21409.32s]  Uh, anyways, why would you look at a funko pop and think why I want to own this?
[21410.28s -> 21413.88s]  Anyways, thanks for the cool stream dad. Hope everything's settling in the new home. All right
[21414.36s -> 21422.86s]  I don't know. Why do people collect why do why do people collect anything?
[21423.58s -> 21425.98s]  Why do people collect stamps?
[21425.98s -> 21430.22s]  It's just something it's a I mean, it's just a piece of paper and it has like elvish on it
[21430.70s -> 21437.48s]  Those are those are cooler. Those are valuable
[21439.11s -> 21442.81s]  Valuable dumbo is 6500 bucks
[21447.32s -> 21451.64s]  Okay, I don't even know why i'm defending funko pop so much because I don't even care
[21452.28s -> 21454.36s]  Like I did up until today
[21454.92s -> 21457.80s]  This stream I did not even give a shit about any of these
[21458.68s -> 21460.28s]  I thought they were like kind
[21460.28s -> 21464.28s]  Okay, like they were cute and they were like interesting. I got them like two or three years ago
[21464.52s -> 21470.60s]  I i'm not some like funko pop aficionado that like cares this much but yet i'm still here defending
[21471.40s -> 21474.97s]  And I will continue to
[21474.97s -> 21482.06s]  I was gonna add a motherfucker on the end of that but i've refrained from it. We're making progress
[21482.78s -> 21490.26s]  But yeah, we're uh, we're settling really well anytime you move. It's it's
[21490.90s -> 21495.30s]  Takes a long time before you actually yeah, this is this is just where I this is where I live, right?
[21495.70s -> 21501.42s]  It takes a little while. No, it's been it's been going good slowly but surely, right?
[21502.92s -> 21504.94s]  Uh kale
[21504.94s -> 21506.06s]  kale

[21523.40s -> 21525.00s]  It's not much but it's my birthday

[21532.81s -> 21536.57s]  Wish it's my birthday wish to give a little something to one of my favorite people ever. Have a good night

[21570.14s -> 21573.96s]  Thanks to the 15 dollars
[21573.96s -> 21575.16s]  uh
[21575.16s -> 21577.56s]  Oh my god. Damn it
[21579.06s -> 21581.06s]  I've even moved
[21581.14s -> 21589.11s]  Places and that's still happening. Why is this happening more frequently? This shit didn't happen this often
[21590.15s -> 21594.63s]  More like a week or two ago. What's going on? Am I am I am I getting more like animated with my hands?
[21596.39s -> 21599.75s]  It must be like an extra animation here with my hands. I don't understand
[21600.39s -> 21603.37s]  The mic is in the same spot
[21603.37s -> 21609.56s]  Ocean dweller. Thanks for the 250. I'm embarrassed for you seeing those funko pops. Please use this money to throw them out
[21611.59s -> 21613.99s]  okay, uh box box came in with
[21615.33s -> 21617.33s]  2 000 people in a raid
[21617.43s -> 21619.83s]  Thanks box box with a huge raid really appreciate it
[21620.55s -> 21623.94s]  If those of you that's still here from that
[21623.94s -> 21625.62s]  Thanks for sticking around
[21625.62s -> 21631.70s]  Hope you enjoyed what you saw and if you didn't sure you'll tell me all about it on reddit
[21632.58s -> 21636.86s]  My favorite website
[21636.86s -> 21641.90s]  Swiggity-swanky. Thanks for the 250 nice pajamas. By the way, it's a captain marvel t-shirt
[21643.51s -> 21645.51s]  This could be this is like a business casual shirt
[21645.91s -> 21651.08s]  But let me thanks to the five dollars germa. I demand that you cover that shelf in high quality anime figurines
[21651.08s -> 21653.43s]  I will never do that
[21653.43s -> 21656.23s]  Not gonna happen
[21656.23s -> 21657.37s]  Thank you
[21657.37s -> 21660.81s]  Uh, thank you lesbian bigfoot for the fifteen hundred bits
[21661.37s -> 21664.09s]  Fifteen dollars absolutely lost it at the funko pop reveal
[21664.73s -> 21667.29s]  Be proud of your non reddit collection jeremy
[21668.25s -> 21670.81s]  Also, I missed the beginning of the stream. Hope auto is doing okay
[21671.37s -> 21673.53s]  Thanks to the great content
[21673.53s -> 21675.35s]  Yeah, he's doing better
[21675.35s -> 21676.39s]  he has
[21676.39s -> 21686.95s]  One or two more days left on the antibiotics the idea is he's getting better and after the next few days when they're all gone
[21687.11s -> 21689.10s]  Hopefully he's back to normal
[21689.10s -> 21691.10s]  He is going to go back in
[21691.10s -> 21693.42s]  for an evaluation
[21693.42s -> 21695.80s]  Just to make sure he's
[21695.80s -> 21699.74s]  100 fine because if there's a case where this comes back
[21700.38s -> 21702.52s]  after the antibiotics
[21702.52s -> 21705.56s]  And there's something else that has to be done here and we got to figure out what's going on
[21706.58s -> 21709.22s]  But we hope it doesn't really get anything too serious
[21711.24s -> 21718.46s]  As it stands right now, he's doing just fine. So thank you goose goose. Thanks for the 252 things. Love the collared shirt
[21719.40s -> 21721.50s]  Professional as fuck
[21721.50s -> 21726.22s]  And two i'm glad auto is doing better. I'm thinking about getting a dog any tips for first-time dog owners
[21727.48s -> 21728.36s]  um
[21728.36s -> 21729.48s]  yes
[21729.48s -> 21739.48s]  rescue rescuing a dog, um is an amazing experience because
[21740.89s -> 21742.73s]  A lot of times they'll be
[21742.73s -> 21747.51s]  Already a couple years old. They might already be used to people. They might already be
[21748.15s -> 21754.54s]  uh house trained
[21754.54s -> 21758.30s]  And you get to take a dog whose life may have been
[21759.02s -> 21762.70s]  turns completely upside down because think about rescues is
[21764.06s -> 21767.00s]  sometimes rescues are
[21767.00s -> 21774.57s]  Dogs or cats or animals or whatever bunny rabbits doesn't matter who just kind of with circumstances got placed in a bad spot
[21775.72s -> 21776.92s]  for instance
[21776.92s -> 21780.76s]  if somebody's owner passes away, I remember when I was uh,
[21781.99s -> 21784.71s]  When I was doing stuff at the animal shelter
[21784.71s -> 21789.78s]  If you don't remember some of you guys were alive you weren't here three four years ago
[21790.26s -> 21795.46s]  Maybe a little bit longer than that. Whatever it was. I I volunteered at the animal shelter for like a year or so
[21796.15s -> 21802.15s]  And animals would come in that was just perfectly normal. There's no there's nothing wrong with them. They weren't doing anything bad
[21802.79s -> 21805.91s]  They were just brought in and one of them was because the owner's uh,
[21806.47s -> 21811.99s]  Their owner had died and they were like four years old, but it was just a great normal just
[21812.55s -> 21817.78s]  Loving dog that is now displaced completely and in a fucking animal shelter
[21817.86s -> 21820.98s]  And it's just like completely different than anything they've ever experienced in their whole life
[21821.22s -> 21826.28s]  And it was just heartbreaking to know that like wow you spent like five years
[21827.21s -> 21833.98s]  Living a potentially normal life in somebody's house and then all of a sudden now you're in an animal shelter can be a lot
[21836.46s -> 21842.07s]  so you get to kind of come in and the cycle the circle gets to
[21842.39s -> 21849.62s]  Complete, you know get to help out when you can and get a dog or a cat that's sort of already
[21850.34s -> 21859.05s]  Got some stuff going on. I would recommend that you rescue your dog. I got my dog from a rescue eight years ago
[21859.05s -> 21861.05s]  And he's so sweet. Yeah, that's auto
[21862.47s -> 21870.06s]  Auto is it as I auto was a rescue. It's the best auto was like the best dog i've ever fucking come across
[21870.38s -> 21875.83s]  I love this dog. He is like the best dog in so many ways
[21876.79s -> 21884.41s]  He was a rescue he was like two or three years old when I got him if that's any anecdotal
[21885.40s -> 21887.40s]  Evidence of how a rescue can be
[21888.52s -> 21908.15s]  There he is. Yeah, hopefully that helps thanks to the 250. Good luck on your dog
[21908.77s -> 21913.54s]  Adventure we also had some subs and by the way, we're gonna do the credits here
[21914.31s -> 21919.67s]  We had five from germa sucks five from tipped over and five we caught already from loser bybeck
[21921.26s -> 21924.38s]  Then we caught tipped over as well. But thanks for the 15 subs in a row there guys all three
[21925.45s -> 21934.50s]  And that will bring us to the point of this stream where we roll the credits right about bumping you in the face
[21937.13s -> 21946.81s]  Thank you all of you for your subscriptions. They I told you I told you this I told you this is just like fucking hundreds of them
[21948.38s -> 21952.39s]  it's crazy I come back from like not streaming from like
[21953.19s -> 21959.37s]  What five days and it's just like boom you guys
[21960.17s -> 21967.85s]  You guys are too good to me. Thank you. All of you appreciate it and let's finish the bits
[21970.52s -> 21976.76s]  Boiky thanks for five dollars question because i'm kind of torn on it myself who wins in terms of video games alone dc or marvel
[21978.78s -> 21981.10s]  Je- in just in terms of video games only video games
[21981.94s -> 21983.94s]  um, I mean the
[21984.42s -> 21996.84s]  How much weight do the arkham batman games carry because it's probably dc trying to think marvel the the spider-man ps4 game was
[21997.24s -> 21999.48s]  awesome
[21999.48s -> 22001.48s]  um, maybe one of the
[22001.96s -> 22005.24s]  marvel ultimate alliance games maybe like the marvel ultimate alliance 2
[22006.18s -> 22009.21s]  Uh, I don't think they can be held up to
[22009.93s -> 22013.29s]  Like arkham city or arkham asylum. It's it's probably dc
[22019.45s -> 22022.79s]  Yeah, dc probably has better games in quotes
[22024.54s -> 22030.86s]  Another fifty dollars come in five thousand fucking five thousand bits another fifty dollars
[22032.55s -> 22037.94s]  Remember today is my one year sub anniversary. I want to do something big to celebrate and thank you for all the laughs
[22037.94s -> 22039.78s]  That you've given me this past year
[22039.78s -> 22043.38s]  These dreams have helped me through so much and have made me laugh when I thought I couldn't anymore
[22043.62s -> 22046.49s]  And led me to meet the most important person in my life
[22047.43s -> 22049.05s]  my boyfriend
[22049.05s -> 22054.42s]  Friedl schlitz without you. We wouldn't have we would have never met. Thanks so much for everything
[22054.74s -> 22063.77s]  That just makes me feel so fucking happy. That's so that's so nice
[22065.27s -> 22067.27s]  I can't yeah, like that's
[22067.80s -> 22073.80s]  I don't even know what to say. That's unbelievable. Thank you so much for the fifty dollars for sticking around both of you
[22074.36s -> 22078.06s]  I can't believe people have met and had
[22079.02s -> 22080.46s]  created long
[22080.46s -> 22084.54s]  Lasting friendships and relationships through this channel. It's mind-boggling to me
[22085.26s -> 22092.57s]  Thank you so much for the fifty dollars. This janitor sucks at his job
[22094.46s -> 22099.74s]  Does he suck at his job or do you guys just keep throwing shit on the floor like right there?
[22100.46s -> 22104.54s]  Maybe if you'd stop throwing things the janitor wouldn't have to come out and clean every single second
[22104.54s -> 22114.62s]  And maybe if they would have somebody rats in here. Thanks a lot. Hey have gone. Thanks for the 250
[22115.18s -> 22118.54s]  General I found it today that I passed my state's bar exam. That's incredible
[22118.94s -> 22122.62s]  Thanks for all the awesome streams that helped me get through law school and bar exam prep
[22122.94s -> 22130.22s]  Also, when are you gonna play morrowind multiplayer with joel tomorrow? Yeah, you guys didn't know tomorrow literally that's happening. Uh on
[22130.86s -> 22141.75s]  On sunday, I mean playing hulk tomorrow and then playing morrowind multiplayer with joel on sunday. I probably shouldn't do that
[22141.99s -> 22143.99s]  That's like that's probably that's not cool
[22144.31s -> 22148.63s]  That's not cool. You can't like you can't do that. That's not cool. That's just not even cool
[22148.95s -> 22151.91s]  Um, so, uh, that was a funny joke that I just did
[22154.33s -> 22158.09s]  I acted like that was just so not cool. Uh, i'm just gonna pretend like I didn't say that
[22162.52s -> 22165.16s]  Hey cat boy, thanks for the 250 high king
[22165.96s -> 22170.44s]  Being another person with adhd. It's super great to see someone else face the same struggles and shit
[22171.21s -> 22173.21s]  Uh not to be epic cringe
[22173.29s -> 22176.41s]  But as someone raised with a not so great parental relationship
[22176.81s -> 22182.04s]  Super nice to have someone like you be able to look up to dad as I go. I must say thank you for the
[22182.68s -> 22184.34s]  Kitty floss
[22184.34s -> 22190.62s]  For the cat with a three face and play super paper mario. I also have funko pops
[22190.62s -> 22197.80s]  I bought years ago. I regret if you want to buy them off of me. I should never even show I
[22198.12s -> 22202.44s]  Whatever. Are we talked about roger rabbit a week ago? That's why I figured he had to show it to you
[22202.68s -> 22209.03s]  Whatever i'll be laughing my way all the way to the bank in 10 years when I sell that roger rabbit for 10 grand
[22213.75s -> 22225.72s]  Or two dollars when that market is worthless. I'll still make some money. Thanks for the 250
[22228.98s -> 22235.30s]  And yeah, I I have adhd as well. It can be it can be annoying
[22235.78s -> 22242.70s]  But you know what? I just try to deal with it. Just try to do it. Remember walk
[22243.86s -> 22245.94s]  Aren't beanie babies the worst bitcoins?

[22258.55s -> 22275.70s]  $7,000 for one. So I mean it's not worth like 30 cents beanie coin
[22277.27s -> 22280.63s]  Here we go again a crypto rant. No, my dad did was a crypto sentence
[22283.67s -> 22289.03s]  Hey hair on flow. Thanks for the five dollars. Hey, germa. My name is chase watching since I was 11
[22289.83s -> 22294.12s]  Making me feel old you make me feel old in like 10 fucking years
[22294.92s -> 22296.92s]  I'm now a freshman in college
[22297.08s -> 22299.80s]  You've been a role model for me for how I act and treat others
[22300.52s -> 22303.24s]  For about half of my life. I truly cannot thank you enough for the joy
[22303.24s -> 22305.48s]  You brought me and for truly saving my life a year ago
[22306.04s -> 22307.96s]  expression is a bitch
[22307.96s -> 22310.52s]  Regardless, you're an amazing person to thank you for being you
[22311.08s -> 22320.31s]  You don't realize the extent that you reach out and touch people. Thank you for the five dollars first of all and second of all
[22321.27s -> 22323.66s]  I sometimes I forget
[22323.66s -> 22326.86s]  That some of you guys have been watching since you were kids
[22329.64s -> 22334.20s]  Like teenagers and now you're you're fucking fully grown adults
[22335.18s -> 22339.66s]  Some of you were fully grown adults before and now you're super fully grown adults like me
[22342.30s -> 22344.22s]  10 years is a long time
[22344.22s -> 22349.77s]  I can't believe there are some people that have been watching for that long. It's still are here. It's still like this channel
[22355.50s -> 22357.42s]  Thanks for watching for that long
[22357.42s -> 22363.78s]  a long fucking time
[22363.78s -> 22365.78s]  gen z boomers

[22375.03s -> 22379.35s]  Fifty dollars. Love your stuff man. And hey if you want you can use this to get a u2's of yourself
[22379.83s -> 22396.81s]  Is that how much they cost a u2's is fifty dollars can I make it like eight
[22397.61s -> 22409.74s]  but would I be the dickhead that has the u2's
[22410.78s -> 22412.22s]  that's like
[22412.22s -> 22417.26s]  It's 75 percent cheaper than every other one on the website. I even can I even I couldn't even do that
[22417.82s -> 22419.50s]  Probably wouldn't even let me do that
[22419.50s -> 22429.29s]  Just do it and buy but get a bunch on your shelf. Well, I just it's not a scenario where hey just go do it
[22430.17s -> 22432.17s]  Don't like they have to want to do that
[22434.42s -> 22436.42s]  That's not like my decision to make
[22436.66s -> 22443.22s]  Now, you know, I just I don't just like call up u2's and go hey, I want one of me
[22443.62s -> 22445.62s]  Okay, see you next week when it's done
[22449.38s -> 22455.62s]  Do one for fireman. That'd be kind of cool. But I don't know but we'll see we'll see if the funko pop meme continues to have legs
[22456.42s -> 22458.31s]  I'll think about it
[22458.31s -> 22462.39s]  Stripes beast. Thanks for 250 germa. The average height in 1800 was five six. Cool
[22462.71s -> 22469.67s]  You see when the chips are down these uh tall people they'll lead each other. See you aren't sure you're just ahead of the curve

[22499.26s -> 22502.87s]  Hard game. I haven't played it one time
[22507.08s -> 22511.80s]  Thank you pixelated cabbage. It is not minecraft. It is the binding of isaac card game board game thing
[22512.92s -> 22517.24s]  Orange lane. Thanks for 250. Listen here you chocolate fudge william defoe hair villain wig wearing
[22517.72s -> 22521.72s]  Uh taquito eating funko pop buying chad pac-man redditor boomer
[22522.36s -> 22524.84s]  Today marks the second year mark of me being subbed to you
[22525.48s -> 22531.40s]  I know i'm just one donation amongst the millions of dollars you get e-clown, but I appreciate you nonetheless
[22532.52s -> 22534.52s]  Uh, not even close
[22537.21s -> 22542.01s]  Uh
[22542.01s -> 22547.59s]  Millions of dollars. That was pretty comprehensive. Yeah, he's a confirmed millionaire
[22553.49s -> 22555.35s]  Confirmed millionaire
[22555.35s -> 22559.69s]  There's a lot of oxymorons in this sentence, baby
[22561.48s -> 22563.48s]  But thank you. Thank you for
[22563.72s -> 22565.16s]  just one
[22565.16s -> 22567.08s]  amongst the millions
[22567.08s -> 22569.21s]  of dollars
[22569.21s -> 22571.21s]  um, you do realize
[22571.29s -> 22574.23s]  that if
[22574.23s -> 22577.35s]  If a thousand of you give 250 bits
[22578.33s -> 22580.17s]  You can do that math
[22581.05s -> 22584.09s]  You know what i'm saying? It's a lot if a lot that's
[22585.88s -> 22594.54s]  Don't ever think that you're not giving that much money a lot of you
[22595.26s -> 22597.11s]  giving a dollar
[22597.11s -> 22599.11s]  adds up to a shitload of money, so
[22599.83s -> 22602.09s]  It's not
[22602.09s -> 22605.05s]  Don't ever think that oh fuck i'm only giving them like a dollar
[22605.45s -> 22609.21s]  Don't ever feel fucking bad about that and don't ever think that you should be doing it in the first place
[22609.85s -> 22617.56s]  Because even giving one dollar to the stream you are part of contributing to
[22618.12s -> 22621.38s]  To this to me
[22621.38s -> 22631.35s]  And sometimes I can't fucking believe it trying to get us to donate. Oh streams are pretty much over
[22631.51s -> 22633.51s]  So no, it's not. Well, we got a lot of bits tonight
[22633.67s -> 22636.47s]  Speaking of money
[22636.47s -> 22641.19s]  Don't ever feel obligated to give me money and when you give me money, don't ever feel like it's not enough money
[22642.44s -> 22644.44s]  Don't please don't feel that way
[22645.99s -> 22649.99s]  Judging by my last comment about statistics and evidence and math
[22656.49s -> 22660.39s]  Thank you. Thank you to
[22661.05s -> 22666.89s]  One one one two e for the three dollars epic streamer room dude pog love the funko's

[22682.41s -> 22686.25s]  Even though you collect funko pops. I still respect you. I don't collect funko pops
[22686.33s -> 22689.13s]  I just have a few of them kim has a few of them
[22689.69s -> 22693.77s]  And together that makes six times that by two we have 12 of them total
[22695.54s -> 22698.10s]  We just have a few we don't have that meant we have a few of them
[22698.50s -> 22701.86s]  And I haven't we haven't bought any in about three and a half years
[22702.42s -> 22709.34s]  Just because I display them today does not mean I bought them today. Yubskidoo. Thanks for 250
[22709.34s -> 22711.74s]  Hey germa, sorry that chat is being so rough with you today
[22712.14s -> 22718.30s]  But since I know for a fact you don't collect dorky figurines. You don't sniff your dogs while he's sleeping
[22718.62s -> 22722.62s]  You don't eat shoes and you didn't outright abandon rain world after only playing for an hour
[22722.70s -> 22731.21s]  I know you're a good person. See I am a good person. Thank you for the 250
[22735.16s -> 22740.54s]  I I see you've said it yourself. Thanks for the 250 dubs kid
[22743.21s -> 22747.37s]  Raddus raccoon. Thanks for 250 germa. You truly do have a fake gamer room. I love it
[22747.45s -> 22750.89s]  Here's to help fund your funko pop collection as I got
[22752.49s -> 22754.49s]  Fake gamer room
[22755.45s -> 22756.89s]  It's a shelf
[22756.89s -> 22760.81s]  With some lights on it and like some old pc games
[22770.86s -> 22773.98s]  Now that funko pop with the clown on the bald head is not even accurate
[22775.67s -> 22777.67s]  10 community subs from tipped over. Thank you
[22779.74s -> 22785.02s]  Evan jelly on thanks for the thousand bits 10 bucks. Hey, man, love the stream speaking of one guy
[22785.74s -> 22788.62s]  I think it'd be cool idea for a stream if you just played a bunch of shitty games
[22789.10s -> 22793.26s]  And if a large enough percentage of chat votes next you actually go to the next game
[22793.90s -> 22799.98s]  The ultimate culmination of that meme anyway, just the thought hope auto as well. Here's a pog coin king. Thank you
[22800.38s -> 22802.38s]  Um, unfortunately you are describing
[22802.94s -> 22807.58s]  Every stream that ever happened when I had the next emote activated
[22809.80s -> 22813.53s]  Uh, that was just every stream
[22813.53s -> 22815.53s]  So I don't I don't know if I want to go back to that
[22815.93s -> 22817.93s]  That was uh, maybe
[22818.09s -> 22827.18s]  We we we bury that one
[22827.18s -> 22829.35s]  Um
[22829.75s -> 22832.79s]  Yeah, um guys it's evan jelly on
[22834.33s -> 22836.33s]  e v a n
[22836.41s -> 22839.05s]  j e l l y e o n
[22840.62s -> 22842.62s]  Evan jelly on i'm saying it correctly
[22845.59s -> 22847.90s]  That's their name
[22847.90s -> 22851.90s]  Bulbaswag desu. Thanks for the five dollars. Hey jerma. I love your be the best you can be thing
[22852.79s -> 22856.47s]  If you ever do want to write about another children's book, that would be a really good one
[22859.67s -> 22862.63s]  There's be you just got to do you you got to do you the way, you know
[22862.63s -> 22866.47s]  How because only you know how to do it and i'll keep saying that over and over again until the day I die
[22871.08s -> 22883.50s]  Be the worst you can be. Well, no, that's that would be the psycho way to say it but you pedal to the metal
[22885.94s -> 22889.70s]  Goose goose. Thanks the 250 my dog will be a rescue. I'm between two
[22890.58s -> 22896.54s]  Let you know what I decide next week. Good luck. I'm sure you make the right choice. Any choice is the right choice
[22897.02s -> 22900.09s]  They're the great dogs
[22900.09s -> 22904.73s]  Sprio, thanks to 250. Hey jerma. Just wanted to ask what is happening with the asmr stream that you were talking about a while
[22904.73s -> 22905.69s]  ago
[22905.69s -> 22907.85s]  That's pretty hyped about it, but the news about it went poof
[22908.78s -> 22910.57s]  Anything about it?
[22910.57s -> 22914.57s]  Uh, I severely underestimated how hard it was to hire an entire marching band
[22918.02s -> 22920.02s]  Uh, that's way harder than it looks
[22923.42s -> 22927.27s]  um
[22927.27s -> 22930.71s]  Like we're talking like a 20 to 30 40 plus person marching band
[22931.67s -> 22933.67s]  Was it going to be on that stream?
[22933.67s -> 22937.51s]  Uh, it was that was the only way I would I would have allowed that stream to happen
[22937.83s -> 22941.19s]  That had to be a thing that had to be on that stream or I was not going to do it
[22942.55s -> 22945.19s]  I don't care how I how funny I thought the other shit could have been
[22945.67s -> 22950.81s]  No without the marching band walking through that stream I've refused to do it
[22955.59s -> 22956.55s]  uh
[22956.55s -> 22960.79s]  I was ready and willing to pay the money and and put up and have it all happen
[22960.79s -> 22972.22s]  But it's hard to hire an entire marching band. I wanted them in full
[22973.00s -> 22975.42s]  costume with with like the trumpets and they're
[22979.42s -> 22991.86s]  Like have I want to have the hats and shit it's still possible just to find a marching band and I gotta want to do it
[22993.69s -> 22995.69s]  You're gonna do it and you're gonna be in your house
[22997.82s -> 23004.30s]  See, but yeah, I mean that's like you don't think that's funny to have like 30 people fucking walk through on webcam
[23005.59s -> 23008.07s]  Playing and like blasting marching band music
[23009.67s -> 23020.71s]  For my asmr stream auto would freak out auto wouldn't be here
[23023.40s -> 23029.80s]  I would make sure auto was out and taking a walk or kim would take him somewhere or something and he wouldn't be here
[23032.52s -> 23036.12s]  What about the neighbors?
[23036.20s -> 23038.10s]  I would have to like
[23038.10s -> 23040.10s]  I would have to give probably a couple knocks
[23041.29s -> 23045.77s]  On some of the doors and just be like, um, can I ask you something?
[23047.37s -> 23049.37s]  Do you like marching bands?
[23050.31s -> 23053.03s]  You do you do that's good to hear
[23053.67s -> 23056.95s]  It's very good to hear how does a free concert sound?
[23058.86s -> 23060.92s]  tomorrow
[23060.92s -> 23062.92s]  At seven o'clock pacific
[23069.78s -> 23071.78s]  No
[23071.78s -> 23076.66s]  Well, no, the idea was if I I would do it at the studio in vegas
