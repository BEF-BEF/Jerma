[0.31s -> 14.04s]  Hey, what's up, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and
[14.04s -> 19.44s]  tonight, I'm gonna be playing as the Engineer. The title, I'll explain the title in a second,
[19.44s -> 23.48s]  but I'll give you the loadout. The loadout is gonna be the Strange Frontier Justice,
[23.48s -> 29.08s]  the Wrangler, and the Strange Wrench. Now, this gameplay is not the best in the world.
[29.08s -> 34.02s]  I don't even think I make it onto the leaderboard, but that's not why I made the video. I made
[34.02s -> 38.94s]  this video to show you guys the Parade of Traveling Engineers. Now, what the hell does
[38.94s -> 44.12s]  that mean? What is a Traveling Parade of Engineers? Well, as you will see, I'm gonna cut around
[44.12s -> 48.72s]  in this gameplay. This is not really a gameplay to show you massive kill streaks and stuff
[48.72s -> 53.22s]  like that. There's a lot of funny things that happen in this, so I really just had to make
[53.22s -> 58.48s]  a video on it. So, this is Badwater. This is the last point on Badwater, and as a lot
[58.48s -> 63.44s]  of you guys know, there are two great places for Sentry Guns here. One across the way,
[63.44s -> 66.84s]  as you see to the right, and over here on the left. So, take a look at this Engineer
[66.84s -> 70.36s]  right here. So, I say, all right, this is fine. We know two Sentries, whatever, we'll
[70.36s -> 76.38s]  deal with it, and then, hey, yo, well, hello. We now have three Sentries over here, and
[76.38s -> 81.66s]  the right side is bare. And I decide, I say, okay, this can't happen. I have to try and
[81.66s -> 86.56s]  do a risky maneuver. I grab the Sentry and make a run for the right side. I end up getting
[86.56s -> 92.55s]  over there unscathed. Fast forwarding about 40 seconds here, and as you'll see, the Sentry
[92.55s -> 97.39s]  is built up to level three, and I have a dispenser here now. So, I'm okay. I got the
[97.39s -> 101.75s]  Wrangler, pull it out, deal with a pesky soldier, and things are looking up. You know, they're
[101.75s -> 105.49s]  almost at the point, but I got a good Sentry here, got a good position. I'm not worried
[105.49s -> 117.35s]  about a thing. And then, here comes the Travelling Parade of Engineers with their two Sentries
[117.35s -> 124.60s]  in the same spot as mine, and I go, okay, I'll help you build it, and let me get me
[124.60s -> 128.22s]  out of here. Quick, quick, go, go, go, go. I try to get over to the other side again,
[128.22s -> 132.50s]  the side where I just was less than a minute and a half ago, and so now there's a sniper
[132.50s -> 136.00s]  shooting at me, and I'm freaking out trying to jump all over the place and crouch and
[136.00s -> 139.94s]  stuff because I don't want to get killed. So, less than 10 seconds go by, and look what
[139.94s -> 144.64s]  happens. This dude comes over, drops one right next to mine again, and this is where I kind
[144.64s -> 149.14s]  of just give up. I say, whatever, we'll do a double defense. I'm not going to sit here.
[149.14s -> 152.82s]  I'm not going to bring my Sentry all over the place. There's four Engineers on the team
[152.82s -> 159.98s]  now, so if you take a look over there, I go, oh, uh, whatever. And this is the part of
[159.98s -> 165.38s]  the gameplay when things all fall apart, and I just start to turn on my Troll Mode. Now,
[165.38s -> 169.42s]  not on my own team, of course. I'm talking about the other team. I start to build Sentries
[169.42s -> 175.24s]  in just odd places, places that could be really easily destroyed, taking out my shotgun, trying
[175.24s -> 179.06s]  to get some crit shots into people, and I actually do get a pretty good one coming up
[179.06s -> 184.46s]  here. So, this is Troll Sentry number one. I think this is actually the one and only
[184.46s -> 188.30s]  Troll Sentry in this particular gameplay, so I bring it up here, trying to get it in
[188.30s -> 192.30s]  a spot where it'll guaranteed kill anyone that walks up to there, and remember, I have
[192.30s -> 196.46s]  the Wrangler, so it's just me being a real jerk, being a real bastard, just shooting
[196.46s -> 200.60s]  people with the Wrangler as they walk by, smack that spy a couple of times, get the
[200.60s -> 205.02s]  kill on it, and then look at this. Look at the traveling parade of Engineers over here.
[205.04s -> 208.84s]  I just, I want to briefly explain to maybe some of the newer guys that don't know what
[208.84s -> 213.66s]  I'm talking about, but the reason why that is a bad idea is if an Uber Demoman comes
[213.66s -> 219.54s]  around that corner, it's only going to take him probably five seconds to destroy every
[219.54s -> 223.82s]  single building over there, because you've got to remember, it only takes three stickies
[223.82s -> 229.12s]  to destroy a Level 3 Sentry gun, and the Demoman in his sticky launcher has eight stickies,
[229.12s -> 234.14s]  so all he really has to do is turn that corner and just start, boom, boom, boom, just spamming
[234.14s -> 239.32s]  stickies all over the place, and he will take out everything. So a good rule of thumb
[239.32s -> 244.88s]  is to always stay at least ten, maybe fifteen feet away from the nearest Engineer and his
[244.88s -> 249.64s]  Sentry gun. Now I know that sometimes that really just is not possible. The situation
[249.64s -> 253.94s]  you just saw earlier is a great example of that. If there's at least three or four Engineers
[253.94s -> 258.30s]  on a team, you're going to be sharing space with people, but if you can at least make
[258.30s -> 263.00s]  a conscious effort to stay as far away from each other as possible, you're just giving
[263.00s -> 269.86s]  your team a better chance of victory. So this Sentry goes down, not big surprise. Oh,
[269.86s -> 275.58s]  Heavy cameo right there. Thanks a lot, Heavy. I appreciate it. You are very welcome. Apparently
[275.58s -> 281.84s]  the Heavy is General Grievous from Star Wars. That was a terrible Heavy impression. You
[281.84s -> 289.12s]  got anything else for us, Heavy? I am going to add your Engineer wrench to my collection.
[289.12s -> 294.48s]  What the hell am I doing right now? Like I'm recording this and listening back to it. What
[294.70s -> 302.26s]  am I doing? Anyways, get the nice revenge shot on that Medic and I see that this Engineer
[302.26s -> 306.46s]  has built up a wrangled Sentry and I'm going to do something about it. So right when he
[306.46s -> 310.06s]  goes to repair it, I'm watching him, watching him, there he goes. I run at him. He must
[310.06s -> 314.02s]  have been like, what the hell are you doing? Get the kill on him right there, but his Sentry
[314.02s -> 319.82s]  obviously turns around and blows me to hell. So this is the end of the gameplay here, guys.
[319.82s -> 324.26s]  Got a Sentry built up in overtime and it kills a few people, but that's not the reason why
[324.28s -> 327.44s]  I'm showing you the end here. I don't get on the leaderboard like I say, but there's
[327.44s -> 332.24s]  one little clip here at the end where I shoot a Demoman that sticky jumped across the map
[332.24s -> 336.20s]  and I was laughing so hard. I thought it was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen.
[336.20s -> 339.44s]  So this is going to be the end of the gameplay here, guys. Thank you so much for watching.
[339.44s -> 344.69s]  I really do appreciate it and I will see you guys all next time. Take care, everybody.
