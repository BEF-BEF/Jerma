[1.46s -> 7.78s]  Hello everybody, welcome to my fancy boat party. I really appreciate everyone for co-
[23.48s -> 29.29s]  A party crasher.
[30.81s -> 40.28s]  Okay, that's- I think that's facing the wrong way.
[41.61s -> 42.65s]  It is.
[42.65s -> 45.27s]  Okay, but this road I'll be able to get.
[47.19s -> 49.19s]  Who shot? Who's shooting?
[49.35s -> 52.04s]  Is that a cop? Are you- are they cop- oh, okay.
[52.52s -> 55.16s]  I want them to come, because I want them to fly off this jump.
[56.04s -> 65.38s]  Oh, I missed it. I missed it.
[81.02s -> 88.62s]  God, this paramedic has no idea what he's doing. He's so confused. Oh, but that first guy.
[89.86s -> 91.86s]  I just saw him go straight up.
[97.94s -> 100.34s]  Please have another guy on a bike come down this road.
[105.86s -> 107.86s]  Grunt, grunt, grunt, grunt.
[108.90s -> 110.90s]  Grunt, grunt, grunt, grunt.
[110.90s -> 112.90s]  Grunt, grunt, grunt, grunt.
[112.90s -> 114.90s]  Grunt, grunt, grunt, grunt.
[114.90s -> 116.90s]  Let's try it at the same time. Ready? One, two, three.
[116.90s -> 118.90s]  Grunt, grunt, grunt, grunt.
[118.90s -> 120.90s]  Grunt, grunt, grunt.
[120.90s -> 122.90s]  Grunt, grunt, grunt. You're not doing it.
[122.90s -> 124.90s]  I just- I forgot how it started.
[124.90s -> 126.90s]  You don't know how the national anthem starts?
[126.90s -> 134.90s]  I thought I knew, but I didn't want to start wrong. You'd be like, you're doing it all wrong. Why are you messing this up?
[134.90s -> 138.90s]  Oh, you wouldn't be unlike most people that have to do it.
[138.90s -> 142.90s]  How many times have people screwed up the national anthem on, like, TV?
[148.30s -> 153.18s]  I might land- no. I thought I was gonna land in this boat.
[153.18s -> 155.18s]  Oh, I didn't even know you left. Where are you?
[155.18s -> 157.18s]  Look at what you did to me.
[157.18s -> 160.82s]  Oh, hold on. I know what I can do.
[160.82s -> 168.20s]  Yeah, let's just keep shooting at bikers until they do something.
[168.20s -> 170.20s]  Oh, there's a bike coming from behind.
[170.20s -> 173.51s]  Alright, so-
[173.51s -> 175.51s]  One of those guys is going.
[175.51s -> 178.90s]  Bingo, bingo. He's going.
[178.90s -> 184.54s]  No, I turned too much. No, no, no, no.
[184.54s -> 186.54s]  This doesn't concern you, other-
[190.12s -> 197.93s]  That didn't work.
[197.93s -> 201.00s]  Oh, that worked for nothing.
[205.85s -> 208.98s]  Oh, all that work.
[208.98s -> 210.98s]  Oh, down the drain.
[210.98s -> 216.23s]  The chase is on. There's another one.
[216.23s -> 218.73s]  Okay, you ready?
[218.73s -> 223.32s]  Hold on.
[223.32s -> 228.74s]  Oh, my.
[228.74s -> 230.74s]  It worked.
[230.74s -> 233.62s]  There's still coming.
[233.62s -> 237.62s]  Do it again. We gotta go on like this straight away right here too. Do it again.
[237.62s -> 241.62s]  Try to go faster, like a little bit faster. Try to get them so they have a lot of speed.
[241.62s -> 248.52s]  There we go.
[248.52s -> 250.52s]  This taxi.
[256.02s -> 258.02s]  This taxi.
[258.02s -> 260.02s]  Crazy taxi, man. What? They're just blowing up for no reason.
[260.02s -> 262.02s]  Oh, my God.
[265.80s -> 267.80s]  Look at how awkward of a place I'm standing.
[267.80s -> 269.80s]  Look at how awkward of a place I'm in, Sharma.
[271.98s -> 276.26s]  Oh, yeah? See you later.
[276.26s -> 278.26s]  Screw you.
[278.26s -> 280.26s]  You just gave me a place to stand.
[283.02s -> 290.76s]  Oh, he kept that going for a while.
[293.13s -> 298.89s]  I'm gonna land this. I'm gonna land this.
[298.89s -> 306.65s]  I look like I'm driving the bicycle and I'm just like, yeah, this is a good jump.
[306.65s -> 308.65s]  Yeah, this is a good jump.
[308.65s -> 310.65s]  Look at this jump right here. Yeah.
[313.02s -> 315.02s]  Oh, man. Did you see that jump?
[315.02s -> 317.77s]  Oh, look at that. Yeah.
[317.77s -> 321.42s]  Nice.
[321.42s -> 323.42s]  So have you boys ever been on top of the captain's quarters?
[323.42s -> 325.42s]  I'll tell you right now.
[325.42s -> 327.42s]  You're in for a treat.
[327.42s -> 329.42s]  It is just absolutely beautiful. I know.
[329.42s -> 335.42s]  Listen, the only select few get to come up here and bask in the beautiful glory that is this top deck.
[335.42s -> 337.42s]  So what the hell was that?
[341.90s -> 343.90s]  No, that was so stupid.
[345.90s -> 347.90s]  I could hear you crashing into Sharma.
[349.90s -> 351.90s]  I could hear you crashing into everything.
[353.90s -> 355.90s]  What are you doing?
