[23.16s -> 27.85s]  Uh, good evening, or good morning, for some of you.
[29.04s -> 29.94s]  Ahem.
[31.83s -> 35.98s]  I was gonna stream tomorrow, the Resident Evil 4 Remake.
[37.40s -> 43.37s]  But, very big but, I thought the game was coming out tomorrow afternoon.
[46.14s -> 50.34s]  I was ready and prepared for the game to launch tomorrow at like 1pm Pacific.
[52.75s -> 56.52s]  But, it's out right now.
[58.16s -> 60.66s]  Came out like 30-40 minutes ago. 9pm?
[61.56s -> 62.56s]  That's pretty reasonable.
[63.16s -> 64.36s]  And I'm very excited.
[65.86s -> 68.96s]  So let's, let's go quietly, cause it's a little late.
[69.26s -> 69.86s]  Let's go.
[71.63s -> 73.33s]  Probably gonna be playing this well into the night here.
[77.08s -> 78.18s]  You're supposed to be asleep?
[81.14s -> 82.14s]  I hope you have a good rest.
[83.55s -> 85.45s]  It came out five hours ago in Canada.
[89.85s -> 90.95s]  Well, I don't live in Canada.
[95.56s -> 98.39s]  I live in, uh, people lost me.
[100.80s -> 102.70s]  Took a little bit to download. There was no preload.
[103.60s -> 105.67s]  Which, is a little surprising.
[106.70s -> 110.80s]  Usually, day before, two days before a game usually have a preload, but it's fine.
[112.29s -> 114.99s]  Had to start downloading it at exactly 9pm.
[117.79s -> 119.69s]  But, I'm very excited for this.
[120.59s -> 123.49s]  And I'm gonna tell you how excited I am, because this is a different scenario.
[125.80s -> 128.20s]  Resident Evil 2 Remake, one of my favorite games.
[128.80s -> 129.20s]  For sure.
[131.54s -> 133.64s]  Resident Evil 3 Remake, not so much.
[134.14s -> 134.74s]  It was alright.
[136.00s -> 137.70s]  But, I've heard really great things about this one.
[141.42s -> 143.52s]  Resident Evil 4 on its own.
[144.12s -> 145.92s]  The original one is probably one of the best games ever made.
[146.90s -> 150.00s]  It's definitely, I would say, deserves to be in the top 10, top 25.
[153.54s -> 154.24s]  So, let's do it.
[154.94s -> 157.04s]  I haven't looked at very much info of this.
[157.84s -> 159.44s]  I know there was a demo. I didn't play it.
[159.94s -> 162.94s]  There's been videos and comparison footage. I haven't seen it.
[163.64s -> 165.64s]  I've seen maybe one minute of footage of this game.
[167.86s -> 169.16s]  There's an FOV slider.
[170.44s -> 171.94s]  So, don't worry.
[172.44s -> 174.44s]  I'm not gonna stay, I'm not gonna freak out.
[175.04s -> 176.84s]  There is an FOV slider in the game.
[177.54s -> 179.14s]  So, we can relax on that.
[181.72s -> 183.12s]  I have adjusted it accordingly.
[188.03s -> 191.13s]  And I don't want to waste any time because other streamers are going faster than me.
[191.13s -> 191.83s]  So, I have to hurry up.
[194.03s -> 198.67s]  I got the, I got the deluxe version.
[198.67s -> 201.07s]  I don't know. It said there was like extra stuff and I was like, should I get it?
[201.07s -> 201.47s]  I don't know.
[202.07s -> 202.57s]  I got it.
[209.24s -> 211.34s]  Now, the weird, this is gonna get really weird.
[211.64s -> 212.74s]  And I'm kind of concerned.
[213.44s -> 217.34s]  I don't know what difficulty to pick because I don't think you can change it.
[221.77s -> 224.77s]  But anyways, yes, I can confirm.
[225.27s -> 226.47s]  The lights are off.
[229.49s -> 230.09s]  Lights are off.
[231.53s -> 232.03s]  Scary.
[232.33s -> 233.13s]  This is a scary game.
[236.33s -> 236.83s]  Lights are off.
[238.34s -> 240.94s]  I'm not playing on the like super difficulty, no way.
[247.08s -> 247.78s]  All right, so let's go.
[248.82s -> 250.42s]  Main story, I'm playing keyboard.
[250.96s -> 251.96s]  Although maybe it's not a good idea.
[252.69s -> 255.49s]  You can now change character costumes and accessories in these.
[255.49s -> 256.69s]  Should I like go do that?
[257.71s -> 261.71s]  You can change the, you can now change the original music slash sound effects.
[262.76s -> 263.56s]  You guys can't even hear it.
[266.62s -> 267.12s]  Okay.
[267.32s -> 267.92s]  Extras.
[269.24s -> 270.54s]  Leon's costume.
[277.74s -> 278.34s]  Okay.
[278.64s -> 282.84s]  Of which one of these am I gonna, I feel like this is gonna fuck the whole game up.
[285.28s -> 285.98s]  You know what I mean?
[285.98s -> 287.28s]  I don't know if I want to do that.
[287.68s -> 289.68s]  I feel like it's gonna change everything.
[293.62s -> 295.12s]  Won't it change everything?
[298.09s -> 299.69s]  I'm just gonna go normal for now.
[299.79s -> 300.99s]  All right, we're gonna go normal.
[301.66s -> 302.36s]  Accessories.
[302.36s -> 303.36s]  How about sunglasses?
[303.36s -> 305.56s]  That's like a remake thing to put on, right?
[307.15s -> 307.65s]  Okay.
[311.72s -> 313.02s]  I'm gonna stay with the defaults.
[314.55s -> 315.45s]  What is that?
[318.62s -> 320.12s]  What is the hero filter?
[320.12s -> 323.02s]  It's just they took the gamma slider and dragged it all the way over.
[325.90s -> 327.10s]  Original music?
[329.83s -> 330.53s]  I don't know.
[330.53s -> 331.93s]  How should I experience this?
[333.88s -> 334.78s]  Default A and D.
[334.78s -> 335.68s]  I can change this later.
[335.68s -> 336.28s]  I'll be all right.
[336.68s -> 337.48s]  I can change it later.
[339.60s -> 340.90s]  Why are you so nervous?
[342.72s -> 344.72s]  I've been looking forward to this game for a long time.
[344.72s -> 347.42s]  I'm like, I love Resident Evil 4.
[348.42s -> 349.22s]  And 5.
[350.59s -> 351.89s]  I'm like, let's go.
[351.89s -> 353.79s]  I'm so excited.
[354.76s -> 355.56s]  All right, let's just go.
[355.56s -> 356.86s]  We're gonna go with the remake.
[357.66s -> 359.06s]  I want to be able to give you a real review.
[361.02s -> 362.82s]  So none of this, we're gonna keep all this off.
[364.01s -> 364.61s]  I'm not nervous.
[364.61s -> 365.81s]  What are you talking about?
[365.81s -> 366.41s]  Are you guys ready?
[367.85s -> 368.95s]  Resident Evil 4 remake.
[374.24s -> 375.54s]  Okay, this is the problem.
[375.94s -> 376.74s]  I'm not gonna do this one.
[377.54s -> 378.24s]  Standard.
[378.44s -> 382.04s]  For players who have not played Resident Evil 4 in 2005.
[383.58s -> 386.78s]  Okay, this changes to easy if you die at game over or whatever.
[388.14s -> 391.24s]  For players who have played Resident Evil 4 in 2000.
[391.44s -> 392.84s]  I have played Resident Evil 4.
[392.84s -> 394.64s]  Does that mean I have to pick this difficulty?
[395.48s -> 397.08s]  Stronger enemies and harder challenges.
[397.08s -> 398.58s]  Higher prices for certain items.
[400.66s -> 403.06s]  How, this is the problem with Resident Evil games though.
[403.56s -> 406.76s]  How much harder is this than standard?
[407.16s -> 408.46s]  Because I can't change this.
[410.04s -> 413.04s]  And I don't want to get somewhere and be like, what a fucking disaster.
[413.64s -> 415.44s]  How much harder is it than standard?
[417.36s -> 418.86s]  It's about two and a half times harder.
[425.72s -> 426.32s]  Moderately.
[428.41s -> 429.11s]  Don't do it.
[429.78s -> 430.58s]  How would we know?
[430.68s -> 431.68s]  It's too hard.
[433.42s -> 434.02s]  Find out.
[434.94s -> 435.44s]  All right.
[435.54s -> 436.14s]  How about this?
[436.14s -> 438.34s]  If the game is too, I can't like restart it.
[438.44s -> 439.84s]  I'm just gonna do standard, right?
[439.84s -> 441.44s]  Like what, I don't care.
[442.47s -> 446.57s]  I don't, I think once you cross, I think once you cross 35 years old,
[447.56s -> 448.66s]  I can pay, I can pick this.
[449.26s -> 449.86s]  You know what I mean?
[450.79s -> 451.59s]  I can pick that.
[452.26s -> 454.16s]  When you go, when you're over 35, you can pick standard.
[454.16s -> 454.66s]  That's fine.
[454.66s -> 455.66s]  And like, oh, come on.
[455.86s -> 457.16s]  Like, ah, yeah, that's fine.
[457.16s -> 457.86s]  You're over 35.
[458.26s -> 459.46s]  Yeah, we're good.
[461.13s -> 461.83s]  I'm almost 40.
[462.13s -> 462.93s]  I can pick that one.
[471.76s -> 474.46s]  The expanded treasure map has been applied.
[474.46s -> 475.66s]  Okay, what does that even mean?
[476.24s -> 478.34s]  You can see the locations of hidden treasures?
[484.52s -> 485.72s]  All right, everybody quiet.
[510.17s -> 510.77s]  Blood.
[518.04s -> 520.24s]  September 30th, 1998.
[521.69s -> 522.89s]  It's a day I'll never forget.
[523.29s -> 526.90s]  The cop inside me died that day.
[527.70s -> 529.70s]  That night, Raccoon City was wiped out.
[530.20s -> 532.40s]  Thanks to the bioweapons created by Umbrella.
[533.67s -> 537.78s]  Somehow I made it out, but too many others weren't so lucky.
[538.68s -> 539.88s]  This is Resident Evil 2, by the way.
[540.48s -> 544.28s]  I was asked later to join a top secret government program.
[545.86s -> 547.16s]  Not that I had a choice.
[549.01s -> 549.61s]  The training.
[550.81s -> 551.81s]  Punishing the missions.
[552.61s -> 553.51s]  Nearly killed me.
[554.92s -> 556.82s]  But at least I kept my mind off everything.
[557.12s -> 560.20s]  If I could just forget what happened that night.
[561.20s -> 564.01s]  Even for a second.
[565.46s -> 566.06s]  This time.
[566.76s -> 568.06s]  It can be different.
[570.37s -> 571.07s]  It has to.
[571.67s -> 572.17s]  Okay.
[576.88s -> 577.78s]  Waiting for this game.
[580.39s -> 584.42s]  For at least two or three days.
[584.62s -> 585.82s]  So tell me Yankee.
[586.76s -> 590.34s]  Why did you come to this horrible place close to nowhere that
[590.34s -> 591.18s]  I've ever seen?
[592.56s -> 597.77s]  Let's just say that someone must be very important.
[599.22s -> 600.92s]  The chief gave the orders himself.
[601.32s -> 601.82s]  Help him.
[601.82s -> 603.02s]  Not very sunny right now.
[603.62s -> 605.42s]  I'm sure your boys didn't come all the way out here to roast
[605.42s -> 606.12s]  marshmallows.
[612.87s -> 614.67s]  You have a strange sense of humor.
[615.63s -> 617.43s]  I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
[618.03s -> 619.23s]  Just between us.
[619.43s -> 620.03s]  It's quiet.
[621.73s -> 622.53s]  Seems like it's kind of loud.
[623.99s -> 625.79s]  And it's been that way for a while now.
[629.42s -> 631.32s]  Should be just another day in the office, right?
[631.62s -> 633.22s]  Gonna get loud just to give you a warning.
[633.32s -> 636.32s]  I mean last week there was a search for some missing hikers.
[637.32s -> 638.92s]  I'm sure you'll do your best to help me.
[647.32s -> 650.62s]  It's like Duke Nukem Netflix adaptation is because the glasses
[653.18s -> 654.78s]  because the glasses that's what you're saying.
[661.58s -> 662.68s]  Nature calls him.
[663.55s -> 664.45s]  I'll be right back.
[697.67s -> 698.57s]  That was pretty good first look.
[699.47s -> 699.97s]  So that's it.
[699.97s -> 700.87s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[701.57s -> 702.57s]  We'll pick it up right where we left off.
[702.57s -> 702.97s]  I think.
[703.87s -> 705.87s]  Just want to get a good feel for the very beginning and see
[705.87s -> 706.47s]  how it was.
[709.56s -> 710.86s]  The opening cutscene to me is very important.
[710.86s -> 712.66s]  I need to kind of digest it for a day or two.
[712.66s -> 713.86s]  I'd say maybe three or four days.
[714.76s -> 716.36s]  I need to kind of relax on the couch for a little while and
[716.36s -> 717.36s]  kind of process everything.
[718.06s -> 721.36s]  So and about yeah, it's going to be probably a few days.
[731.94s -> 733.84s]  He sure is taking his time.
[734.60s -> 735.40s]  Did he fall in?
[737.46s -> 740.26s]  Maybe you better go and take a look.
[741.32s -> 742.42s]  I want to take the glasses off.
[742.42s -> 743.82s]  It's ruining my remake.
[745.38s -> 746.78s]  It's ruining my immersion in the remake.
[751.85s -> 752.85s]  So much for helping me.
[758.21s -> 758.81s]  Here we go.
[766.00s -> 767.30s]  It looks pretty good.
[767.50s -> 768.60s]  How does it run though?
[769.82s -> 770.22s]  Hold on.
[773.48s -> 774.18s]  How does it run?
[779.44s -> 781.54s]  That seems it seems pretty clean actually.
[785.35s -> 787.25s]  I'm so glad I could turn the FOV up as well.
[792.39s -> 793.29s]  It seems pretty clean.
[801.46s -> 803.36s]  Wait, there's a jump scare right now isn't there?
[803.46s -> 805.86s]  Yeah, there is just to give a quick warning for everybody.
[806.16s -> 809.26s]  Birds fly down and scare you in like five seconds.
[809.46s -> 810.16s]  From what I remember.
[810.46s -> 811.86s]  How far could you have gone?
[812.59s -> 815.59s]  In three, two, one, cue the birds.
[819.19s -> 822.85s]  Cue the, the birds are coming soon.
[826.52s -> 827.42s]  I need to change that.
[832.93s -> 833.23s]  Sorry.
[833.23s -> 833.93s]  Give me one second.
[836.09s -> 837.89s]  E and F always need to be flipped for me.
[837.89s -> 841.98s]  I don't I don't know what happened in the last five years
[841.98s -> 846.96s]  of gaming but F replaced E for some reason and I've been
[846.96s -> 848.26s]  trying to figure out why for a long time.
[849.26s -> 852.70s]  F replaced E and it was always E and I think it's because
[852.70s -> 854.10s]  E started to become lean.
[856.23s -> 856.73s]  I wanted E.
[857.37s -> 857.67s]  Sorry.
[866.26s -> 866.86s]  Knife and parry.
[866.86s -> 867.26s]  That's fine.
[867.26s -> 867.66s]  Space.
[867.66s -> 868.56s]  Pick up item.
[868.56s -> 869.46s]  Examine F.
[869.46s -> 870.26s]  No, it's E.
[871.42s -> 873.12s]  And melee is mouse button.
[874.56s -> 875.06s]  Reload.
[875.06s -> 875.96s]  That's fine being R.
[878.46s -> 880.98s]  Isn't already knife.
[880.98s -> 881.38s]  Okay.
[883.04s -> 884.34s]  Attach remove mines.
[884.44s -> 885.44s]  G is fine.
[886.24s -> 887.34s]  Move backwards.
[888.39s -> 888.89s]  Move camera.
[888.89s -> 889.39s]  Run and shift.
[889.39s -> 890.09s]  That's fine.
[890.49s -> 892.59s]  Crouch stand evade is C.
[893.51s -> 893.91s]  Come on.
[893.91s -> 895.01s]  What year is it?
[895.59s -> 896.59s]  How can we change these things?
[896.59s -> 897.59s]  Even staples for years.
[898.68s -> 899.68s]  Or control, right?
[900.28s -> 901.28s]  What is control in the game?
[901.58s -> 902.38s]  Command Ashley.
[902.38s -> 902.88s]  Oh, okay.
[903.91s -> 904.31s]  C.
[906.68s -> 907.18s]  All right, we're good.
[908.56s -> 910.06s]  Unable to apply some changes.
[914.38s -> 914.88s]  Wait, what?
[916.51s -> 917.01s]  What was wrong?
[921.08s -> 921.38s]  I don't know.
[921.38s -> 921.98s]  Make this like...
[923.26s -> 924.06s]  No, stop.
[924.76s -> 924.96s]  I don't know.
[924.96s -> 926.26s]  Make this like Y.
[928.13s -> 928.63s]  We're good.
[929.57s -> 929.97s]  Cut it out.
[933.52s -> 933.92s]  E.
[933.92s -> 934.62s]  There it is.
[934.72s -> 935.92s]  And then melee.
[935.92s -> 936.32s]  There we go.
[936.32s -> 936.62s]  We're good.
[945.84s -> 946.94s]  Oh, no, that wasn't it.
[947.54s -> 948.24s]  Wasn't that it?
[949.50s -> 950.90s]  That was fucking pretty scary.
[955.58s -> 956.48s]  I remember this house.
[964.56s -> 966.46s]  I wonder how much of this I truly remember because it's
[966.76s -> 968.46s]  It's actually been a really long time.
[969.06s -> 971.76s]  The last time I actually played for Resident Evil 4.
[974.14s -> 975.34s]  I mean, it has to be
[976.50s -> 977.20s]  10 years.
[977.80s -> 978.70s]  Has to be 10 years.
[980.12s -> 981.12s]  Maybe a little less.
[981.12s -> 982.22s]  Maybe I don't know.
[982.22s -> 983.02s]  Maybe a little more.
[986.15s -> 987.05s]  It looks great though.
[988.82s -> 990.62s]  I'm so glad I avoided all the footage.
[990.62s -> 991.42s]  Anyone home?
[993.73s -> 994.93s]  Might be a little too loud.
[995.90s -> 996.30s]  But it's okay.
[996.30s -> 997.00s]  We'll figure that out.
[1022.61s -> 1023.11s]  What's that?
[1025.88s -> 1027.48s]  Should I pretend like I've never played this before?
[1029.43s -> 1030.33s]  That's probably a good idea, right?
[1031.46s -> 1032.66s]  Just like pretend like I've never played this.
[1034.32s -> 1036.02s]  Isn't that that the YouTube video will be so much better?
[1036.62s -> 1037.92s]  And I'll get so many more engagements.
[1061.66s -> 1064.06s]  This place looks so much different now.
[1065.18s -> 1066.08s]  It's crazy.
[1070.12s -> 1071.52s]  This feels like a different game.
[1071.82s -> 1072.82s]  Even though I know it's not.
[1076.87s -> 1078.27s]  Sorry to barge in like this.
[1091.20s -> 1091.60s]  Say it.
[1092.44s -> 1092.94s]  Do it.
[1094.19s -> 1095.19s]  We're all waiting for it.
[1098.52s -> 1099.32s]  We're all waiting for it.
[1099.82s -> 1111.81s]  That's loud.
[1112.31s -> 1113.21s]  Sorry, I'll fix it.
[1132.60s -> 1133.00s]  Okay.
[1133.50s -> 1134.10s]  Important.
[1134.10s -> 1134.80s]  I know people...
[1135.10s -> 1137.30s]  I know I'm breaking your immersion and breaking my immersion,
[1137.30s -> 1138.10s]  but we got to get this right.
[1138.80s -> 1140.00s]  I am a toggle
[1140.48s -> 1141.58s]  aim down sights person.
[1142.76s -> 1143.16s]  Now,
[1143.46s -> 1143.76s]  I don't...
[1143.76s -> 1144.36s]  I know that
[1144.96s -> 1146.16s]  offends a lot of people probably,
[1146.16s -> 1146.86s]  but I don't care.
[1147.96s -> 1148.66s]  Is it in the game?
[1152.08s -> 1152.88s]  Cursor lock.
[1153.52s -> 1153.92s]  Control...
[1153.92s -> 1154.32s]  No.
[1155.89s -> 1156.59s]  Auto reload.
[1156.89s -> 1158.09s]  I actually don't like that very much.
[1158.09s -> 1158.89s]  I don't like that either.
[1159.49s -> 1160.29s]  I don't like that either.
[1161.96s -> 1162.86s]  But I'm going to do it.
[1164.53s -> 1165.43s]  Aim assist off.
[1166.94s -> 1167.74s]  Where would it be?
[1169.67s -> 1170.17s]  Where would it be?
[1172.19s -> 1173.09s]  But aim assist is off.
[1175.34s -> 1176.44s]  You're literally a psycho.
[1176.54s -> 1176.94s]  What?
[1181.33s -> 1183.03s]  Is there a toggle aim down sights?
[1188.18s -> 1189.38s]  It's in the camera settings.
[1189.48s -> 1189.78s]  Okay.
[1192.44s -> 1193.14s]  Oh, right here.
[1193.14s -> 1193.74s]  Hold on a minute.
[1194.60s -> 1195.50s]  When aiming,
[1196.37s -> 1198.07s]  this is camera inversion.
[1201.05s -> 1202.05s]  Field of view.
[1204.20s -> 1204.70s]  Where is it?
[1206.43s -> 1206.93s]  Is it here?
[1209.55s -> 1210.45s]  Field of view.
[1210.85s -> 1211.85s]  Camera sensitivity.
[1211.85s -> 1213.05s]  Camera inversion.
[1213.05s -> 1214.35s]  Camera acceleration.
[1214.85s -> 1216.05s]  Camera speed.
[1217.12s -> 1217.92s]  Does anyone know where it is?
[1220.35s -> 1221.25s]  Then controls.
[1222.95s -> 1223.75s]  Accessibility maybe?
[1230.51s -> 1231.31s]  Control type.
[1234.49s -> 1235.59s]  Quick turn type.
[1236.09s -> 1236.49s]  Crouch.
[1236.69s -> 1237.69s]  Type is toggle.
[1240.90s -> 1241.80s]  Repeated input.
[1242.67s -> 1244.97s]  Oh, you got a toggle for crouch, but no toggle for...
[1245.37s -> 1245.67s]  Really?
[1245.77s -> 1246.37s]  Oh, come on.
[1248.50s -> 1248.90s]  Play.
[1249.00s -> 1250.50s]  I, I, this is how I like to play.
[1252.30s -> 1253.20s]  Is it actually not in the game?
[1262.13s -> 1263.13s]  Two to the right.
[1263.33s -> 1264.63s]  Down three in camera.
[1288.68s -> 1289.18s]  Aim.
[1289.48s -> 1289.78s]  Wait.
[1297.16s -> 1297.56s]  Whatever.
[1298.94s -> 1299.44s]  I'll deal with it.
[1300.00s -> 1300.40s]  That's all right.
[1301.71s -> 1303.41s]  This sensitivity has to come way up, but...
[1304.01s -> 1304.81s]  And I'm going to fix it.
[1305.11s -> 1305.91s]  You do your settings.
[1305.91s -> 1306.61s]  You do your settings.
[1306.61s -> 1309.61s]  I couldn't get in here and do this before because the preload,
[1309.71s -> 1310.51s]  there's no preload.
[1310.51s -> 1311.51s]  And there, just wait.
[1314.10s -> 1314.70s]  Sensitivity.
[1321.45s -> 1322.95s]  Is it camera speed?
[1328.22s -> 1330.12s]  These, these settings are kind of confusing.
[1331.35s -> 1331.85s]  That's better.
[1334.22s -> 1334.42s]  All right.
[1334.42s -> 1337.88s]  I might fix it later, but we're going to see.
[1338.48s -> 1344.70s]  Man, that stinks.
[1347.30s -> 1348.50s]  Those were controller settings.
[1349.00s -> 1349.70s]  Turn up the FOV.
[1349.70s -> 1351.10s]  FOV is at the highest it can go.
[1352.43s -> 1353.23s]  I think it's a good spot.
[1358.26s -> 1358.66s]  All right.
[1358.76s -> 1359.46s]  HUD looks good.
[1361.46s -> 1361.76s]  Yeah.
[1361.86s -> 1362.16s]  Okay.
[1362.26s -> 1362.56s]  Let's go.
[1364.22s -> 1374.66s]  Leon's jacket would be way too big for you.
[1376.68s -> 1377.88s]  So order me a small.
[1377.98s -> 1378.28s]  Of what?
[1378.28s -> 1381.78s]  I, you can't, oh, you can't get me a small police jacket?
[1382.18s -> 1382.98s]  What are you talking about?
[1383.08s -> 1385.48s]  Why, why would I put on somebody else's jacket?
[1389.72s -> 1390.12s]  Creepy.
[1392.02s -> 1393.12s]  Not extra small.
[1393.12s -> 1395.12s]  I'm a men's small to medium.
[1395.96s -> 1396.76s]  Don't change that.
[1406.40s -> 1408.70s]  This game is fucked up.
[1418.66s -> 1419.96s]  There's no way you're a small.
[1422.28s -> 1424.28s]  I'm a, I am a, I'm a men's small.
[1424.78s -> 1425.28s]  It depends.
[1426.76s -> 1437.36s]  Hey, here it comes.
[1438.16s -> 1438.56s]  I read you.
[1439.56s -> 1440.96s]  Let me sip my tea before we get into this.
[1440.96s -> 1441.76s]  What's your situation?
[1449.45s -> 1450.45s]  Take the glasses off.
[1450.45s -> 1451.75s]  I, not yet.
[1451.85s -> 1453.35s]  I'll leave them for one more cut scene.
[1459.48s -> 1460.88s]  This is way scarier.
[1466.08s -> 1467.38s]  This is way scarier.
[1475.10s -> 1485.06s]  Ah, see before I could kind of, I could hide behind the
[1485.06s -> 1487.76s]  fact that it was the graphics weren't, I mean, the graphics
[1487.76s -> 1488.86s]  were good at the time.
[1488.96s -> 1491.66s]  But if you go back and play the old resume before it's
[1491.66s -> 1492.36s]  like, oh, okay.
[1492.36s -> 1495.79s]  Like this current gen graphics makes this way scarier.
[1496.76s -> 1518.83s]  I don't know why it just does quiet.
[1525.22s -> 1527.32s]  I'm so glad I didn't play on the fucking hardcore.
[1528.02s -> 1529.52s]  I'm so glad I didn't play on hardcore.
[1532.29s -> 1532.99s]  Wait, how do I do it?
[1533.93s -> 1535.03s]  Oh, it's a, it's mouse button.
[1537.97s -> 1538.67s]  It's mouse button.
[1538.97s -> 1541.77s]  It's a mouse button to do the melee execute, right?
[1544.15s -> 1545.75s]  So glad I'm not playing on a fucking hardcore.
[1545.75s -> 1548.99s]  When you're 35 and older, you can pick this.
[1550.41s -> 1552.81s]  Once you drop out of that, okay, any bracket that says,
[1552.81s -> 1553.81s]  Hey, how old are you?
[1553.91s -> 1555.71s]  What is your, what age are you in?
[1556.11s -> 1558.21s]  You know, it's usually 18 to 34, right?
[1558.81s -> 1560.81s]  The second that you go over 35 plus, like when you go to
[1560.81s -> 1563.11s]  the next bracket, just pick the regular difficulties.
[1564.14s -> 1564.84s]  There's no reason to.
[1569.84s -> 1571.14s]  Was there anything else in here that I needed?
[1575.44s -> 1576.54s]  You've changed.
[1578.29s -> 1579.79s]  Yeah, I fucking aged.
[1582.59s -> 1583.49s]  You are correct.
[1583.59s -> 1583.99s]  You are.
[1583.99s -> 1585.59s]  You are absolutely correct.
[1586.19s -> 1589.29s]  I have changed to very, I have changed a lot in the last
[1589.69s -> 1591.09s]  10 to 20 plus years.
[1592.21s -> 1593.31s]  I'm a little older now.
[1595.13s -> 1596.43s]  Hey, you kids don't even know.
[1598.55s -> 1600.05s]  Don't you have to pull bookcases and stuff?
[1602.36s -> 1604.36s]  Are you, I don't want to spoil it for anybody, but
[1605.78s -> 1606.88s]  I'm trying to remember how this plays out.
[1614.02s -> 1614.92s]  How many bullets left?
[1634.22s -> 1635.52s]  Take the glasses off.
[1638.50s -> 1641.14s]  Bruce, this is Gondor one.
[1641.24s -> 1641.94s]  Hunnigan here.
[1641.94s -> 1642.74s]  What's your sit rep?
[1643.14s -> 1645.01s]  President's daughter, baby Eagle.
[1645.91s -> 1647.21s]  It's likely she's in this village.
[1648.73s -> 1650.03s]  Our Intel was correct then.
[1650.33s -> 1650.83s]  Well done.
[1652.09s -> 1653.39s]  Need a location on a nearby lake.
[1653.39s -> 1655.59s]  We'll do comedy mode later.
[1655.69s -> 1656.19s]  Copy that.
[1656.79s -> 1657.79s]  I'll see what I can find.
[1659.78s -> 1661.18s]  Something's happened to people here.
[1662.53s -> 1663.33s]  My escorts are.
[1666.92s -> 1668.12s]  The audio is so much.
[1669.92s -> 1671.82s]  They spent a lot of time on the audio.
[1672.62s -> 1673.62s]  I don't have any bullets.
[1674.66s -> 1675.66s]  Did I pick hardcore?
[1690.72s -> 1692.62s]  I wanted to look directly into the camera and go.
[1693.22s -> 1694.12s]  Wouldn't put a stair though.
[1695.51s -> 1697.31s]  Boom, big music cue.
[1697.31s -> 1697.91s]  You know what I mean?
[1702.85s -> 1704.35s]  Just how we know what game we're playing.
[1719.14s -> 1719.84s]  Glasses off.
[1720.24s -> 1721.44s]  No, the glass is staying on.
[1722.12s -> 1723.82s]  For at least 10 to 20 more minutes.
[1736.27s -> 1736.77s]  That crow.
[1737.34s -> 1739.44s]  Raven was as big as a dog.
[1744.07s -> 1744.57s]  I think.
[1744.57s -> 1745.37s]  Yeah, it's E.
[1747.18s -> 1747.48s]  Yep.
[1747.88s -> 1748.58s]  Handgun ammo.
[1748.68s -> 1749.08s]  Good.
[1749.38s -> 1750.28s]  Gonna need a lot of that.
[1751.08s -> 1752.38s]  What do I want to upgrade though?
[1752.38s -> 1752.98s]  That's the thing.
[1752.98s -> 1754.28s]  I always pick something different.
[1766.86s -> 1767.76s]  Okay, save it.
[1769.92s -> 1771.32s]  And attach it.
[1771.32s -> 1773.92s]  Case has been added to the customized case menu.
[1774.40s -> 1776.40s]  Charm has been added to the customized case menu.
[1776.90s -> 1778.60s]  Deluxe weapon has been added to the menu.
[1780.72s -> 1781.12s]  Okay.
[1788.02s -> 1788.82s]  This is cheating.
[1788.82s -> 1790.42s]  Is this isn't this?
[1790.82s -> 1792.22s]  I have two free weapons.
[1792.22s -> 1793.02s]  This is cheating.
[1795.12s -> 1796.12s]  I got the deluxe edition.
[1796.12s -> 1797.62s]  I'm a big fan.
[1798.12s -> 1799.02s]  I got the deluxe edition.
[1799.02s -> 1801.40s]  So what we don't have to use it.
[1801.40s -> 1802.50s]  I just I'm a big fan.
[1802.50s -> 1804.00s]  So I got the deluxe edition.
[1811.34s -> 1812.24s]  I won't use it.
[1812.98s -> 1821.12s]  We need to stay true to the original and I'm going to be
[1821.12s -> 1823.32s]  I'm going to have a gold case because that's I think that's kind of cool.
[1824.77s -> 1825.97s]  Increased drop rate.
[1826.98s -> 1829.27s]  Wait, this is cheating.
[1835.35s -> 1838.35s]  Increased drop rate for gunpowder increased drop rate.
[1839.25s -> 1844.64s]  Wait, wait, this is the actual case does this too.
[1847.56s -> 1848.36s]  Is this new?
[1849.87s -> 1850.77s]  I don't remember this.
[1854.07s -> 1855.67s]  Well those bonuses in the regular game.
[1856.86s -> 1858.06s]  I would I'd rather the handgun ammo.
[1862.41s -> 1863.41s]  Okay, very good.
[1868.24s -> 1868.64s]  Continue.
[1878.35s -> 1881.86s]  Ooh, very nice.
[1885.74s -> 1887.24s]  This is the village part, isn't it?
[1887.34s -> 1887.84s]  All right.
[1887.94s -> 1904.38s]  This is the first real test that handgun ammo.
[1905.40s -> 1905.80s]  Thank you.
[1922.07s -> 1923.37s]  Do I even have the knife yet?
[1924.54s -> 1925.34s]  I don't think I do.
[1926.92s -> 1927.62s]  That's money.
[1937.91s -> 1938.51s]  Whoo.
[1953.72s -> 1954.02s]  All right.
[1954.02s -> 1955.72s]  So that's how you do the execute.
[1955.72s -> 1956.12s]  Okay.
[1957.56s -> 1957.76s]  All right.
[1957.76s -> 1958.76s]  That's how you do the execute.
[1960.14s -> 1962.44s]  So you're going to knock him down then go over and stab them on the ground.
[1963.50s -> 1964.00s]  Very cool.
[1965.28s -> 1966.18s]  These people were friendly.
[1982.10s -> 1983.40s]  I forgot these existed.
[1983.40s -> 1984.20s]  I forgot.
[1984.20s -> 1985.80s]  I think it's been 10 years since I played this.
[1994.35s -> 1995.35s]  Oh my god.
[2009.76s -> 2013.12s]  Somebody there are herbs in this game.
[2013.22s -> 2014.32s]  You got to combine them, right?
[2018.96s -> 2020.56s]  Or did they streamline that somehow?
[2022.00s -> 2022.70s]  Flash grenade.
[2023.47s -> 2024.27s]  Change weapon.
[2024.67s -> 2024.87s]  Okay.
[2024.87s -> 2025.17s]  Yep.
[2025.17s -> 2025.57s]  Cool.
[2027.74s -> 2030.84s]  I'm going to save all those to the end of the game and throw them all
[2031.64s -> 2033.84s]  at the t-virus whatever it is.
[2034.61s -> 2037.31s]  So I'm going to make sure I probably will have like 30 or 40 flashbangs
[2038.92s -> 2039.62s]  at the end of the game.
[2040.79s -> 2041.39s]  Which is fine.
[2057.88s -> 2058.48s]  Looks great.
[2066.87s -> 2067.37s]  Cool.
[2092.38s -> 2092.88s]  I'm coming.
[2111.23s -> 2111.73s]  Why not?
[2132.24s -> 2133.14s]  Oh my god.
[2136.84s -> 2139.14s]  That's the worst place for that to be on my thumb button.
[2144.33s -> 2145.13s]  Oh fuck.
[2146.32s -> 2148.22s]  You're doing it hard to suppress this.
[2148.82s -> 2157.75s]  Shit.
[2157.75s -> 2158.35s]  I suck.
[2160.12s -> 2160.82s]  What's quick turn?
[2160.82s -> 2161.42s]  What's quick turn?
[2161.42s -> 2161.82s]  It's Q.
[2162.32s -> 2180.95s]  Ow.
[2189.56s -> 2189.86s]  Yep.
[2189.86s -> 2190.26s]  Yep.
[2200.63s -> 2201.63s]  You're fucked bro.
[2201.73s -> 2202.43s]  No, I'm fine.
[2202.43s -> 2202.63s]  I'm fine.
[2202.63s -> 2202.93s]  I'm fine.
[2208.16s -> 2210.46s]  This is so much scarier than the other one.
[2211.56s -> 2212.66s]  It feels like two.
[2212.76s -> 2214.26s]  It feels like more real somehow.
[2214.26s -> 2215.46s]  I don't know why it just does.
[2217.17s -> 2218.07s]  Oh shit.
[2227.46s -> 2228.36s]  Oh my god.
[2246.06s -> 2248.16s]  This is not one of these guys in the original.
[2249.58s -> 2250.68s]  Wait, was there?
[2266.26s -> 2266.86s]  Oh shit.
[2269.04s -> 2269.94s]  Whoa.
[2272.00s -> 2272.90s]  Get out of my way.
[2273.00s -> 2274.20s]  Get out of my way.
[2274.30s -> 2275.00s]  Get out of my way.
[2275.00s -> 2276.10s]  I should have picked the system.
[2276.30s -> 2277.40s]  I should have picked the system.
[2278.10s -> 2279.00s]  I should have picked the system.
[2279.50s -> 2280.30s]  That was my fault.
[2280.40s -> 2281.20s]  That was my fault.
[2286.56s -> 2287.26s]  Oh my god.
[2287.26s -> 2288.26s]  That's so much worse.
[2301.81s -> 2303.11s]  I need ammo.
[2308.14s -> 2309.64s]  Get the fuck out of my way.
[2310.04s -> 2311.70s]  Oh shit.
[2312.92s -> 2314.42s]  I have to change this key vine.
[2330.54s -> 2331.34s]  Oh, oh.
[2331.34s -> 2332.86s]  How do I do it?
[2332.86s -> 2333.36s]  Five.
[2333.46s -> 2334.06s]  Press five.
[2334.06s -> 2334.76s]  Press five.
[2335.66s -> 2340.77s]  How do I do it?
[2341.77s -> 2343.07s]  How do I do it?
[2343.47s -> 2345.07s]  Why can't I throw the grenade?
[2345.27s -> 2346.17s]  How do I do it?
[2349.23s -> 2350.43s]  Oh fuck all of you in there.
[2354.87s -> 2355.47s]  Give me that.
[2355.47s -> 2355.77s]  Give me that.
[2355.77s -> 2356.57s]  I need that money.
[2358.12s -> 2359.02s]  Oh shit.
[2363.96s -> 2364.46s]  What?
[2365.03s -> 2365.83s]  Get away from me.
[2366.23s -> 2369.18s]  Ow.
[2369.58s -> 2371.83s]  Ow.
[2372.03s -> 2374.27s]  I need more healing.
[2374.57s -> 2375.67s]  How do I win?
[2376.17s -> 2376.67s]  Don't you?
[2378.16s -> 2378.86s]  There it is.
[2378.86s -> 2379.26s]  Okay.
[2379.26s -> 2381.06s]  I was saying what the fuck?
[2381.75s -> 2383.45s]  I was like you got to just live man.
[2387.66s -> 2388.66s]  I was going to say.
[2389.46s -> 2390.76s]  I feel like that took longer.
[2410.06s -> 2411.46s]  That was so terrifying.
[2411.66s -> 2412.96s]  It's so much worse now.
[2418.92s -> 2420.02s]  I got to collect all those items.
[2451.37s -> 2451.87s]  Jeez.
[2458.34s -> 2459.34s]  Where's everyone going?
[2460.14s -> 2460.64s]  Bingo.
[2466.80s -> 2467.60s]  That was awesome.
[2467.80s -> 2469.40s]  That was actually really cool.
[2473.77s -> 2475.97s]  I very very vividly remember this part, but
[2476.57s -> 2477.37s]  wow, that was
[2478.94s -> 2479.94s]  that was something else.
[2480.98s -> 2481.18s]  All right.
[2481.18s -> 2484.88s]  So the issue it's you have to get to here and then press five.
[2486.16s -> 2487.66s]  It's not you don't just press five.
[2487.66s -> 2489.26s]  Wait, I can just press five.
[2489.26s -> 2489.76s]  Why wasn't this?
[2491.10s -> 2495.24s]  That wasn't working before kind of panicking.
[2495.71s -> 2495.91s]  All right.
[2495.91s -> 2497.21s]  Let me explore first.
[2506.14s -> 2507.34s]  I'm not doing good.
[2508.96s -> 2509.66s]  Copy that.
[2510.74s -> 2511.74s]  I look like shit.
[2519.83s -> 2520.73s]  Okay, good.
[2522.50s -> 2523.10s]  Map.
[2524.29s -> 2525.09s]  You could become lost.
[2525.09s -> 2527.49s]  You can check your map position and objectives on the map.
[2527.99s -> 2528.79s]  You have a treasure map.
[2528.79s -> 2531.09s]  You'll be able to see the locations of hidden valuables.
[2533.78s -> 2534.28s]  That's cool.
[2537.74s -> 2538.94s]  I love these games.
[2543.20s -> 2544.10s]  No, don't throw that.
[2548.06s -> 2548.96s]  Reload the gun.
[2550.67s -> 2557.58s]  Ah, you take some ibuprofen or something the shotgun.
[2558.32s -> 2559.32s]  Oh, nice.
[2563.40s -> 2564.10s]  Nice.
[2566.68s -> 2569.18s]  Even if I take ibuprofen, it's gonna take like 45 minutes for it to
[2569.18s -> 2569.58s]  kick in.
[2581.34s -> 2584.86s]  Okay, I actually I am going to heal.
[2584.86s -> 2587.56s]  Item crafting certain materials such as resources, gunpowder and knives
[2587.56s -> 2588.66s]  can be used to craft different items.
[2589.20s -> 2591.40s]  The types of items that you can craft can be increased by obtaining
[2591.40s -> 2592.60s]  new crafting recipes.
[2594.54s -> 2596.24s]  This wasn't in the old one, was it?
[2597.37s -> 2601.31s]  Maybe it was handgun and was it?
[2601.31s -> 2602.31s]  What is that a burrito?
[2604.64s -> 2605.34s]  What is that thing?
[2617.73s -> 2619.73s]  I know just wait till you can do complete herbs.
[2619.73s -> 2620.03s]  I don't know.
[2620.03s -> 2620.53s]  I doesn't matter.
[2620.53s -> 2620.93s]  I don't care.
[2626.91s -> 2628.51s]  I should probably put I'm just gonna do this.
[2628.51s -> 2629.01s]  Whatever.
[2632.15s -> 2633.15s]  I should assign this.
[2633.85s -> 2634.55s]  Oh, you can't.
[2638.06s -> 2638.36s]  Cool.
[2638.36s -> 2639.46s]  I'm gonna explore a little bit.
[2639.46s -> 2640.66s]  I don't want to forget anything.
[2640.66s -> 2642.76s]  I don't want to leave anything and I know because everyone this is
[2642.76s -> 2646.36s]  a beloved video game and everybody's played probably five times
[2646.36s -> 2647.26s]  each all of us.
[2647.66s -> 2651.06s]  I'm gonna miss a treasure and it's gonna be spam in my chat people
[2651.06s -> 2652.46s]  screaming at me because I missed it.
[2652.96s -> 2654.26s]  So I'm gonna do my best.
[2660.29s -> 2660.79s]  Very good.
[2664.14s -> 2666.64s]  I know that there's they put the treasure on the map now.
[2666.84s -> 2667.84s]  So there's one in here.
[2673.06s -> 2673.96s]  I had never played this before.
[2673.96s -> 2674.96s]  I'm not 37.
[2676.35s -> 2677.75s]  That's true for some of you.
[2677.75s -> 2680.41s]  Maybe this is hurt.
[2682.53s -> 2683.03s]  No, I'm good.
[2684.24s -> 2684.44s]  All right.
[2684.44s -> 2688.80s]  So the treasures in here covered maybe.
[2689.40s -> 2693.48s]  No, how's the audio and visual?
[2693.48s -> 2694.98s]  Is it brightness?
[2695.91s -> 2698.41s]  You're blocking your health and ammo with your face cam.
[2699.28s -> 2702.05s]  Oh, that's gonna be fixed.
[2703.97s -> 2704.57s]  Is that better?
[2707.93s -> 2708.53s]  That's better, right?
[2709.97s -> 2713.37s]  It's a little too dark because I thought it was a little too dark
[2713.37s -> 2714.87s]  when I was doing the initial setup.
[2714.87s -> 2719.97s]  So I'm probably gonna turn it up a little bit if I do that.
[2725.82s -> 2726.82s]  Good luck finding that.
[2734.63s -> 2736.33s]  I don't have super resolution on my way.
[2736.33s -> 2737.23s]  I was there.
[2737.23s -> 2737.83s]  I missed it.
[2738.23s -> 2738.53s]  Okay.
[2738.53s -> 2742.67s]  Yeah, I see we'll go like we'll go up to the middle.
[2742.97s -> 2743.97s]  I think that's looks good.
[2744.96s -> 2746.56s]  The better it was a little better.
[2748.66s -> 2749.76s]  I don't have a key for this.
[2751.02s -> 2751.12s]  All right.
[2751.12s -> 2753.32s]  There's one more over here, but it's a locked door so I can't
[2753.32s -> 2755.82s]  get in up that it shows everything on the map.
[2755.82s -> 2758.22s]  Now that's actually incredibly useful.
[2763.44s -> 2763.74s]  All right.
[2763.84s -> 2764.94s]  Where did I throw that grenade?
[2764.94s -> 2767.24s]  Because I want to go in that room.
[2768.40s -> 2769.00s]  Who's in here?
[2779.14s -> 2780.44s]  These people are sick.
[2785.44s -> 2785.64s]  All right.
[2785.64s -> 2787.54s]  So this is where I threw the grenade in here and there was a
[2787.54s -> 2788.54s]  bunch of shit on the ground.
[2790.56s -> 2791.46s]  Okay, nice.
[2794.72s -> 2797.12s]  Oh, think of that's everything.
[2797.32s -> 2797.52s]  Now.
[2797.52s -> 2799.02s]  I'm not going to get everything.
[2799.12s -> 2801.32s]  I'm not going to get everything people might expect.
[2801.32s -> 2802.62s]  Why do you not going to get everything?
[2802.62s -> 2803.72s]  I'm not going to get everything.
[2813.46s -> 2816.16s]  One more spot to look is in here.
[2816.16s -> 2817.16s]  I can I go in here yet?
[2818.38s -> 2818.78s]  I cannot.
[2819.18s -> 2819.98s]  This is a little bit later.
[2822.94s -> 2823.74s]  Get everything.
[2823.84s -> 2824.84s]  I'm not going to get everything.
[2824.84s -> 2825.64s]  I know.
[2825.74s -> 2828.66s]  No, I'm going to go up here and look.
[2833.47s -> 2834.77s]  Can you please not stream till 3 a.m.
[2834.77s -> 2835.17s]  Again?
[2835.87s -> 2836.97s]  Oh, I can't promise you anything.
[2838.29s -> 2838.49s]  All right.
[2838.49s -> 2841.17s]  So over here, there's a treasure.
[2845.97s -> 2847.17s]  My whole body hurts.
[2847.37s -> 2848.07s]  Everything hurts.
[2848.07s -> 2850.17s]  I just like had a heart attack in one second.
[2850.87s -> 2852.47s]  That's I don't remember that happening.
[2855.04s -> 2855.94s]  Ooh.
[2859.94s -> 2860.24s]  Yep.
[2860.24s -> 2861.04s]  You get gems.
[2861.04s -> 2861.64s]  You combine them.
[2861.64s -> 2862.54s]  So the worth way more.
[2867.54s -> 2867.94s]  All right.
[2868.34s -> 2869.84s]  I think we've got everything we needed from here.
[2870.70s -> 2872.50s]  It's time to continue the playthrough.
[2875.94s -> 2878.12s]  Bloody Vamo like did everything.
[2878.12s -> 2879.62s]  Now we have to go back this way.
[2879.62s -> 2880.02s]  Right?
[2885.43s -> 2886.13s]  I don't remember this.
[2886.13s -> 2886.73s]  I don't remember that.
[2886.73s -> 2887.33s]  I don't remember that.
[2887.33s -> 2887.83s]  I don't remember this.
[2887.83s -> 2888.53s]  I don't remember that.
[2891.90s -> 2896.77s]  Did I get everything in here Ruby?
[2897.77s -> 2899.07s]  That wasn't even on the map and I got it.
[2911.48s -> 2913.28s]  Please don't spend all the treasure you get on that family
[2913.28s -> 2914.18s]  guy mobile game app.
[2914.78s -> 2915.78s]  I can't promise that either.
[2918.86s -> 2920.26s]  I drank all my tea already.
[2920.46s -> 2921.46s]  Must be a stressful game.
[2922.52s -> 2923.22s]  All the tea is gone.
[2926.17s -> 2927.57s]  I'm going to get a refill already.
[2927.77s -> 2931.74s]  There it is.
[2938.91s -> 2946.85s]  I got to be way more conservative with shooting our resources.
[2947.35s -> 2948.15s]  There we go.
[2948.15s -> 2951.57s]  Now I can make some bullets if I want to go.
[2956.15s -> 2958.55s]  It says standard, but I might be a bug in the game because
[2958.55s -> 2960.25s]  I picked hardcore before starting.
[2960.25s -> 2963.48s]  So the game is hardcore.
[2963.48s -> 2965.48s]  I think it's on hardcore, but just kind of says it isn't
[2966.35s -> 2967.85s]  as I think it's a known bug.
[2970.38s -> 2972.68s]  So how much better is this than the other shotgun?
[2974.83s -> 2976.33s]  Can I look at the damage on it?
[2981.87s -> 2982.47s]  Who cares?
[2982.47s -> 2983.57s]  I'm going to use it.
[2983.57s -> 2983.97s]  Fuck it.
[2983.97s -> 2984.47s]  Why not?
[2987.86s -> 2989.16s]  That's my hand good made for Leon.
[2991.62s -> 2992.72s]  Sentinel nine.
[2993.02s -> 2997.64s]  It's cluttered now.
[2997.84s -> 2998.44s]  I'll fix it.
[3001.18s -> 3005.58s]  This is going to turn into the lawnmower bag when you're done
[3005.58s -> 3006.48s]  at the end of the day.
[3007.42s -> 3010.22s]  This is kind of just a cut a bunch of cut grass in here.
[3011.44s -> 3012.04s]  I'm a cheater.
[3012.04s -> 3012.44s]  It's fine.
[3014.98s -> 3015.38s]  That's fine.
[3017.46s -> 3021.40s]  I'm going to put this on here.
[3026.90s -> 3027.40s]  Okay.
[3031.05s -> 3033.32s]  Hey, I'm not going to combine any of this.
[3034.71s -> 3035.41s]  Yeah, this is fine.
[3036.15s -> 3038.72s]  I'm going to put this over on.
[3039.49s -> 3041.88s]  Yeah, there we go.
[3041.98s -> 3042.38s]  Okay.
[3046.54s -> 3047.44s]  This is a good bit.
[3050.37s -> 3050.97s]  What's the bit?
[3053.64s -> 3057.04s]  I mean, this is I got I got this because I paid an extra $10
[3057.04s -> 3057.64s]  for the game.
[3064.24s -> 3065.04s]  It's going to be cluttered.
[3065.14s -> 3065.84s]  Ah shit.
[3065.84s -> 3066.24s]  You're right.
[3066.24s -> 3066.94s]  No, whatever.
[3066.94s -> 3067.44s]  I don't care.
[3067.54s -> 3068.94s]  Not in the very beginning of the game like this.
[3068.94s -> 3069.64s]  It's going to be fine.
[3072.26s -> 3073.46s]  Let's just test it and see how it is.
[3074.37s -> 3075.17s]  If I don't if I like it.
[3075.17s -> 3075.57s]  I like it.
[3097.72s -> 3098.22s]  Give me that.
[3098.42s -> 3099.32s]  There's a jewel right here.
[3106.79s -> 3107.29s]  Oops.
[3120.09s -> 3120.79s]  Oh eggs.
[3121.29s -> 3133.50s]  Thanks for the oh, the deluxe gun is pretty good.
[3139.01s -> 3142.58s]  There's a bacon lettuce and tomato on this one.
[3152.35s -> 3153.55s]  Blue request notes.
[3154.05s -> 3156.65s]  You can take on tasks by collecting the blue request
[3156.65s -> 3160.57s]  notes posted around the areas and destroy.
[3160.57s -> 3165.31s]  Okay, destroy all the blue medallions.
[3165.41s -> 3166.31s]  I've only got three more.
[3167.19s -> 3168.59s]  So it's a good question.
[3182.57s -> 3182.87s]  Good.
[3187.12s -> 3188.32s]  I mean, this ain't a speedrun.
[3188.62s -> 3189.52s]  So hold on.
[3190.68s -> 3191.48s]  This ain't a speedrun.
[3200.44s -> 3200.94s]  Hurry up.
[3200.94s -> 3201.44s]  Hurry up.
[3201.74s -> 3202.44s]  This ain't a speedrun.
[3206.14s -> 3207.24s]  I want to check all this out.
[3207.54s -> 3208.94s]  I'm not trying to go as fast as I can.
[3225.58s -> 3226.78s]  It even all right.
[3226.78s -> 3228.28s]  It shows where they are.
[3229.02s -> 3230.88s]  That's useful.
[3230.88s -> 3232.18s]  I guess you don't have to really look for
[3232.18s -> 3243.29s]  them is just because it's a deluxe treasure map.
[3243.49s -> 3244.39s]  You have the cheater map.
[3244.39s -> 3245.59s]  It's because you paid for it.
[3246.85s -> 3247.35s]  Really?
[3248.55s -> 3249.65s]  Is that for real?
[3251.97s -> 3253.57s]  I have the cheater map.
[3256.44s -> 3257.24s]  Are you serious?
[3257.24s -> 3258.54s]  That's actually whatever.
[3261.87s -> 3263.27s]  I have the cheater map.
[3266.02s -> 3267.62s]  Oh, I do.
[3271.59s -> 3275.00s]  Hey, when you get to be 35 and older.
[3277.05s -> 3278.65s]  Sorry, you can get the cheater map.
[3278.65s -> 3278.95s]  Sorry.
[3281.78s -> 3283.08s]  So then that where's this one then?
[3285.32s -> 3286.02s]  Up here.
[3288.24s -> 3288.64s]  Right there.
[3288.64s -> 3289.44s]  So what do I get?
[3291.98s -> 3293.28s]  Hey, I got it.
[3294.12s -> 3295.12s]  Challenge complete.
[3305.11s -> 3305.81s]  I want that.
[3308.31s -> 3309.01s]  Where is this lady?
[3311.90s -> 3312.80s]  Where is this lady?
[3321.96s -> 3322.36s]  I don't know.
[3325.11s -> 3325.51s]  Let's go.
[3337.83s -> 3338.63s]  I see it.
[3338.73s -> 3339.03s]  Okay.
[3339.03s -> 3340.73s]  I know it's pretending that I couldn't see it.
[3355.21s -> 3357.61s]  Remember the cheater map just turned this from a 30-hour
[3357.61s -> 3359.81s]  playthrough to a 130-hour playthrough.
[3363.42s -> 3366.13s]  Kind of true because I'm going to be like, oh look, this
[3366.13s -> 3367.53s]  one other go that way and go get that.
[3377.52s -> 3378.82s]  I need to look at the map a lot though.
[3378.82s -> 3380.42s]  I'm a map user.
[3381.12s -> 3398.80s]  Oh, somebody bought the deluxe edition.
[3399.77s -> 3400.17s]  Sorry.
[3412.11s -> 3413.41s]  Let me see the other deluxe edition.
[3415.28s -> 3423.25s]  Oh, you get a gear.
[3424.47s -> 3425.87s]  I got to fix everything myself.
[3425.87s -> 3426.47s]  Mm-hmm.
[3445.29s -> 3446.29s]  Anything else I missed in here?
[3456.99s -> 3459.73s]  That is what what does that drop down?
[3462.42s -> 3463.62s]  Is that what that's what the chest is, isn't it?
[3469.44s -> 3470.44s]  Ask the cheater map.
[3470.44s -> 3471.14s]  Maybe it'll know.
[3473.99s -> 3474.69s]  Oh, interesting.
[3474.79s -> 3475.49s]  Yeah, down here.
[3475.79s -> 3477.39s]  Yeah, no, I knew where this was.

[3484.80s -> 3486.30s]  Ooh, nice.
[3487.49s -> 3488.49s]  I didn't look at the cheater map for this.
[3488.49s -> 3489.19s]  I saw it through the door.
[3501.88s -> 3502.48s]  What the fuck was that?
[3513.94s -> 3514.54s]  It's a knife.

[4587.57s -> 4620.48s]  right inventory management time this thing is broken so i i know that like people like to say
[4621.20s -> 4625.92s]  that however your inventory management is in resident evil games is like you're taking a
[4625.92s -> 4631.12s]  meyers briggs personality test so i don't know how well you guys can decipher from this but this is
[4631.12s -> 4669.02s]  how i do it auto sort why would i i don't know i want to do it i like it much cleaner looking
[4670.45s -> 4687.07s]  much cleaner all right we're good now auto sorted and ruin it so what do i get for personality
[4687.07s -> 4707.33s]  what do you think somebody said this is an average tick talker awful normie normie will bring
[4707.33s -> 4732.51s]  everything is that true yeah yeah yeah exactly all right don't die this is where i lost before

[4757.26s -> 4763.87s]  of money all right let's take a look at the cheating menu take something cool over there
[4763.87s -> 4792.91s]  that's not hurting me anything back here no got everything it looks really really good i don't
[4792.91s -> 4818.56s]  even have every setting turned on either it looks oh i get those glasses off hero filter i imagine
[4818.56s -> 4829.92s]  playing with that on the whole game what about the villain filter i just feel like i have low
[4829.92s -> 4841.54s]  health that's a nice it's all right but i'm i don't think i'm gonna turn that on
[4853.18s -> 4858.46s]  i gotta use q more often the quick turn just saves your life so many times i love the parry
[4858.46s -> 4862.06s]  the path all right now i'm understanding we're hardcore could have been all right
[4862.06s -> 4880.54s]  the parry is a very interesting just addition anything else i can't open this shoot the water
[4881.81s -> 4905.47s]  shoot the water shoot the water shoot the water wait shoot the water why lol lol lol why do i have
[4906.35s -> 4918.16s]  all right hold on a second no i i think don't isn't that no no no no no no no no i know i know
[4918.16s -> 4923.62s]  and i'm not starting this fucking whole section over again i know what happens i'm not starting
[4923.62s -> 4927.65s]  the whole section over you can pet pet laugh all you want i'm not gonna start the whole section
[4927.65s -> 4934.69s]  over is there a safe point i'll just for all the people that safe point is so far away i've never
[4934.69s -> 4968.78s]  seen it before please just do it wrong spot you're wasting but what do you mean wrong spot it's the
[4968.78s -> 5010.56s]  end of the pier it takes 10 shots what are people just making this up this is not even the right
[5010.56s -> 5023.01s]  dock is this the wrong dock it might not even be in the remake did i just shoot like 20 bullets
[5023.01s -> 5035.41s]  for no reason it's the wrong dock it's the wrong dock wrong lake i didn't need that ammo anyways
[5035.41s -> 5049.86s]  who cares it's the wrong game dude you know it's the wrong game no that's i didn't i didn't even
[5049.86s -> 5058.58s]  need the bullets i'm fine look it's literally one packet of bullets i'll be fine look already
[5058.58s -> 5069.41s]  i just replaced them already everything's fine it's okay i have the delight somebody said to
[5069.41s -> 5076.40s]  take the deluxe glasses off that's how i can see everything this is the hud my deluxe glasses
[5076.40s -> 5142.66s]  now i can't take them off how do i pull this up reliably i guess i'm all right damn it heck like
[5142.66s -> 5186.74s]  all the everywhere isn't there shit under here or something what's that noise that parry is
[5188.83s -> 5195.60s]  that parry is so fucking cool what an insane addition they added that's awesome you could
[5195.60s -> 5202.45s]  probably play through this whole game and parry you broke the knife again it doesn't matter was
[5202.45s -> 5219.74s]  it what it was in the other one i don't know wasn't probably missed a few things but okay
[5219.74s -> 5223.98s]  can you parry the chainsaw i that is a great question i have no idea that's a good question
[5223.98s -> 5242.43s]  though i'm kind of too afraid to do that it kills you in like one or two hits i need another t
[5243.07s -> 5250.35s]  hurts you know it seemed like you really wanted to talk how observant senor now uh say uh you gotta
[5250.35s -> 5255.26s]  smoke i know those things will kill you oh maybe just untie me then huh

[5348.06s -> 5353.76s]  if i'm gonna have the dlc glasses on i'm gonna keep you know whatever i need to see what the
[5353.76s -> 5363.09s]  power levels are can you see that eventually don't you eventually upgrade and it tells you
[5363.09s -> 5386.67s]  how much damage it does check my new examine it sacrificial lamb will receive our most sacred

[5423.02s -> 5433.52s]  and i'm beat up in office i can see you're thinking bet you've been in spots like this before
[5435.20s -> 5445.49s]  i guess you're here looking for someone one more guess maybe some missing senorita young girl
[5445.49s -> 5458.37s]  well talk now all right see her chatter about moving senorita i said saw trap where who knows
[5458.93s -> 5464.77s]  but later saw some men dragging someone to the old church

[5477.58s -> 5477.82s]  back
[5492.02s -> 5509.31s]  hey we're not done here do you guys think they're gonna remake this game in 20 years what do you

[6236.38s -> 6240.70s]  knife needs care all right this is what i needed to look at could be the difference between
[6240.70s -> 6250.98s]  life this is 1.0 it's 1.10 so they're both the same exact power this one just costs more to
[6250.98s -> 6263.18s]  upgrade if i if i upgrade this it goes they both go to 130 10 19 reload speed is 1.9 it actually
[6263.18s -> 6270.61s]  is better rate of fire one rate of fire this is slower though wait one point no that's faster
[6271.25s -> 6279.84s]  this is just a better handgun listen to the chat what what are you talking about
[6280.56s -> 6285.70s]  sell all you wait wait wait wait what's going on softlock not locked stop reading
[6286.42s -> 6295.42s]  nerd nerd nerd what happened what's going on and his money mate ah this is how you compare
[6296.22s -> 6311.50s]  what what's going on what do you mean let me go back here because this is this fit here
[6312.06s -> 6333.62s]  so i did this red and blue that's fine right or shift you can redo it red and red is worth more
[6335.63s -> 6344.21s]  then i can't do red yellow and blue in the other one yeah it said i didn't need the key you can
[6344.21s -> 6364.06s]  take them out okay 3000 plus 3000 so remove them so this is plus 4000 two color bonus is worth more
[6365.12s -> 6377.74s]  okay let's go that's worth more there you get a bonus or save them now why not the duo bonus
[6377.74s -> 6396.74s]  is better is it no but but that's 3000 3000 do a bonus times 1.2 is 12 000 that's 4000
[6397.46s -> 6403.02s]  this is worth more it's worth more by a hundred that's worth more than by a hundred
[6403.02s -> 6415.12s]  it's a difference of 100 wow well only 100 it's still more that might be the one bullet
[6415.12s -> 6422.62s]  that i shoot the boss and kill it save the sapphire you know i'm like so paranoid i hate
[6422.62s -> 6432.19s]  i don't i hate doing these we're pulling them all out okay because i like i know there's other
[6432.19s -> 6446.51s]  shit that i can do later all right let me prepare this okay your weapons are in good hands mate

[6455.41s -> 6469.70s]  with me all right so what about this hours lower on the sunglasses gun reload speed is
[6470.02s -> 6479.63s]  much faster rate of fire is faster but really not that big of a deal the regular one's better i
[6479.63s -> 6487.49s]  think i'm gonna use sentinel 9 with the ammo in it we're all gonna get replaced anyways maybe
[6487.49s -> 6491.01s]  i just won't upgrade anything and say and just have like a million dollars at the end of the stream
[6491.57s -> 6505.36s]  this is where decisions come out though that cash in your pocket all your life easy choice

[8107.44s -> 8118.40s]  my own traps that i put down let's go the right way that game was so horrible god how awful that
[8118.40s -> 8146.70s]  game really was it was so scary and so stressful not this time i thought it came out of there and
[8146.70s -> 8170.56s]  was a trap be so fucked up as you're getting imagine get being in the bathroom and having
[8170.56s -> 8179.14s]  somebody kick you in the sternum to a point where your back flies up against the wall next to you
[8179.14s -> 8186.03s]  the force is so much that without even wiping your ass you get kicked in the chest and your your back
[8186.03s -> 8198.42s]  is planted against the wall and your head up there but the such an awful way to go is there
[8198.42s -> 8215.98s]  anything even in here no it's just scary i remember this part not too shabby smoky someone has shown
[8216.06s -> 8236.21s]  up their neighbors i remember this part old photos good wait any other um treasures in here

[8396.64s -> 8411.50s]  pig regularly grandadman her beloved babe crop big babe now where have i seen those before three
[8411.50s -> 8449.73s]  things wait guys oh that's not big crystal marble ooh you have any thoughts on counter
[8449.73s -> 8475.09s]  strike two not really i don't really play counter strike at all it feels like a new enemy type
[8475.09s -> 8489.20s]  with the necks like this played csgo in like 2011 yeah it's been a long time though counter
[8489.20s -> 8493.94s]  striker is always too hard for me and i'm completely fine admitting that and accepting that
[8494.66s -> 8502.61s]  counter strike just felt like it would just just took so much skill to play it
[8502.61s -> 8605.38s]  if you're good at it good for you it's actually kind of hard to control the mouse got it somebody
[8605.38s -> 8616.62s]  can read that later that's not that's really not even a lot of lore either i thought it was going
[8616.62s -> 8661.92s]  to be a lot he has accepted the gift oh yeah i forgot i completely forgot that a to uh is in
[8661.92s -> 8697.90s]  this game what do you mean spoiler what those sunglasses are so bad i mean capcom put it in
[8699.34s -> 8703.10s]  it was the remake it was 81 accuracy find me another streamer that can do that
[8703.82s -> 8711.34s]  you know what i mean find me like another live streamer on the internet that can get in yeah get
[8711.34s -> 8731.26s]  you an 81 percent first try moist head 90 moon moons on hardcore critical has 90 you're you are
[8731.26s -> 8750.05s]  lame you're so lame is that funny because there's so many people streaming this probably right now
[8751.31s -> 8769.82s]  there's a lot of really good players like imagine actually making that statement you just did i'm
[8769.82s -> 8786.94s]  kidding it was a joke don't make me put on the pay to win case whoa wait wait wait what are these
[8786.94s -> 8818.16s]  equipped left equipped center i got these little toys what i just do how do i take that off charm

[8864.99s -> 8881.42s]  whatever all right i mean are these part of it whatever i'll keep them on how many chapters are
[8881.42s -> 8897.02s]  in reasoning before just to be a researcher for should have left him in that bag i'm sending you
[8897.02s -> 8904.53s]  the details take a look but baby eagle is your priority copy that making my way to the church
[8905.17s -> 8940.16s]  condor one oh i can't go up there i need a right okay i believe this gets a little wacky here
[8940.80s -> 8947.01s]  somebody in chat somebody says can you somebody in chat please help me why do i sneeze when i eat
[8947.01s -> 8954.40s]  chocolate are you allergic to chocolate would be the first guess maybe you have a mild allergy
[8954.40s -> 8970.13s]  to chocolate i don't know be careful food allergies don't work like that i'm not allergic to anything
[8970.93s -> 9001.26s]  it's a bathroom okay wait don't i i swear something's here maybe not well i have the key

[9086.06s -> 9102.00s]  resources where there's snakes mr treasure it's okay let's get on the next playthrough
[9102.00s -> 9105.79s]  there's no way i'm not going to play i'm going to play through this absolutely guaranteed at
[9105.79s -> 9110.53s]  least like another two or three times probably not on stream i'll probably just do it in my uh
[9110.53s -> 9125.42s]  my own time or something at some point let's do the real treasure hunting so far this runs
[9126.14s -> 9133.57s]  perfectly i'd say it's perfect i haven't seen anything really bad so far i'll like slow down
[9133.57s -> 9139.73s]  so there's been a little bit of a stutter like just a hint loading up some a new area but it's
[9141.54s -> 9149.36s]  it's pretty smooth it's pretty solid at like 144 it feels like i have v sync on but it seems
[9149.36s -> 9169.02s]  really seems pretty good it'll stutter sometimes in the rain um i think that's all right from what
[9169.02s -> 9177.65s]  i remember this resident evil 2 remake engine whatever it is was phenomenal it was very very
[9177.65s -> 9200.83s]  good it's probably one of the better engines i've played our game on what the hell i thought these
[9200.83s -> 9221.17s]  were friends i thought they were friends open oh god oh no no no no no no no no no no no shit
[9221.73s -> 9260.91s]  well that's unfortunate where is it on the stairs okay wait wait wait wait wait i know i gotta do

[9430.34s -> 9447.01s]  these right cool cool late stream is scary well it makes the game a little scarier because it's
[9447.01s -> 9454.35s]  dark i actually like streaming with the camera with the lights down because you can't see all
[9454.35s -> 9492.96s]  like the weird tendencies of my face i like it it's so it's pog oh i don't have let's go i didn't

[10766.34s -> 10781.65s]  know it was the the pie on the window sill was floating around this late yeah sometimes it's
[10781.65s -> 10799.52s]  what you want that sounds like pretty good weed no uh that is not what uh that's not what just
[10799.52s -> 10814.83s]  happened i told you guys before uh i i don't do that on stream not anymore i didn't really
[10814.83s -> 10824.99s]  do it that often anyways but no i just can't i physically would not be able to stream like
[10824.99s -> 10841.54s]  it's been pretty clear after you couldn't read a clock yeah but it was more than that though it
[10841.54s -> 10852.88s]  was just i it just my ability to even talk like oh i'm streaming right now what are we gonna talk
[10852.88s -> 10862.42s]  about it was just like i i can't even what this i don't know the streams were kind of like i don't
[10862.42s -> 10873.47s]  even know how to explain it but you know what i mean i thought they were funny they can be fun
[10873.47s -> 10879.82s]  and funny and everything but i also don't want i also don't want to have it be a thing that i'm
[10879.82s -> 10884.14s]  just like oh look i look at how cool this is i'm it's funny i'm high isn't that cool
[10886.50s -> 10903.20s]  yeah it's funny to talk about but obviously i don't want it to be a staple of this channel
[10903.20s -> 10924.93s]  anyways i think i'm ready no you get it i don't have to say anymore let's go uh all right make
[10924.93s -> 10933.74s]  sure it's not too loud because of the music i had before good pretty okay that kind of scared this
[10933.74s -> 10943.04s]  shit out of me all right so we good why am i i'm like blue right now why it wasn't like this
[10943.04s -> 10949.31s]  before was it all right i got what i need i got what i wanted i've got my new weapon i have no
[10949.31s -> 10952.91s]  idea how good it is i have no idea how much damage it does i have no idea if it's worth
[10952.91s -> 10966.22s]  actually using we're gonna use it the game is saved let's go i'm gonna send you a strongly
[10966.22s -> 10973.73s]  worded letter um well just just put it in here i mean you can i think you really can do like
[10973.73s -> 10983.30s]  100 200 characters or something but just put it here make mines i'll have to buy the recipe
[10983.30s -> 10995.06s]  it's okay i'll do it in a minute ooh a church i made it how much longer you're gonna be live for
[10996.50s -> 11004.02s]  that's a good question i don't want to go too too i'm like doing fine i'm very much awake very much
[11004.02s -> 11031.98s]  awake i don't want to go too too late i was at least through the first boss i think that makes
[11031.98s -> 11037.09s]  sense to me that's a good place to stop for tonight i'm trying to think of the schedule for
[11037.09s -> 11043.07s]  this weekend too because i even want to do like technically whatever would be tomorrow like
[11043.07s -> 11051.81s]  tonight tomorrow and maybe sunday or tonight and then saturday sunday trying to think of how i
[11051.81s -> 11063.14s]  should do it probably saturday sunday you can play diablo 4 nah nah i think i got what i wanted out
[11063.14s -> 11069.15s]  of it um it's definitely kind of not enough for me to understand if i really like it or not
[11070.05s -> 11076.90s]  it was fun but i can i can see i can see some cracks that i don't know if it's gonna be
[11076.90s -> 11082.50s]  through all the whole release through the end game of the content i don't know and i think i'd rather
[11082.50s -> 11100.51s]  just just wait it's i'm just gonna wait right miss damn it condor one to roost the church is
[11100.51s -> 11107.17s]  sealed up and baby eagle negative nothing yet but they sure do have this place locked up tight
[11107.81s -> 11115.15s]  i see i can think of one reason they'd want to do so oh she's here that's for sure i'll find a
[11115.15s -> 11123.26s]  way in condor one out but also i mean i don't i don't even know if i'm gonna play d4 i think
[11123.26s -> 11128.78s]  the reason why i wanted to play diablo 4 was just because everything i heard leading up to it was
[11128.78s -> 11138.50s]  hey diablo 2 remember that game we remember that game i think that's why i was thinking
[11138.50s -> 11145.94s]  about playing it but yeah we'll see if i play it i play it if i don't i don't i don't have like a
[11145.94s -> 11160.59s]  really a plan to um but yeah we'll see we don't talk about diablo 3 diablo 3 was all right it
[11160.59s -> 11168.88s]  was fine i i mean as much as i just wish it was a different game it was the game that it was and
[11168.88s -> 11177.20s]  i played a lot of it i played i've got i got a lot out of that game i did those traitorous twins
[11177.20s -> 11181.82s]  should not be allowed to rest in peace for joining that evil cult someone anyone destroy
[11181.82s -> 11189.12s]  the emblems engraved upon their tombstones destroy the tombstone emblems oh that's easy i can do that
[11189.12s -> 11218.42s]  right now is it back here also i said this earlier i think before playing d4 i think blizzard's in
[11218.42s -> 11226.14s]  kind of a weird spot right now where they really kind of they like they need to have something
[11226.14s -> 11229.90s]  right they have to kind of i feel like i haven't really cared about a blizzard game in a long time
[11232.40s -> 11238.30s]  like the last the last i want to say five years have been they've been pretty
[11238.30s -> 11253.57s]  fucked up so i don't know is this it does that count is it what does it want me to destroy
[11254.29s -> 11271.86s]  i said the the twins or something right is it these ones and i look at that note where is it
[11271.86s -> 11278.27s]  those traitors twins should not be allowed to rest in peace for joining that evil cult i think it's
[11279.15s -> 11321.44s]  okay let me in here lakeside map test bro he outsid his om for the irl locker and the
[11323.02s -> 11330.34s]  church and weight orders from your lord until then keep the church door shut
[11330.98s -> 11336.66s]  if you'll be held in the cave on the other side of the you didn't really hide this that well
[11337.87s -> 11351.63s]  the monster will deal with the it's this didn't take that long to crack didn't you just tell us
[11351.63s -> 11361.86s]  that you weren't high yeah i'm making i'm making a point that this is not that well somebody was
[11361.86s -> 11381.14s]  trying to hide this text i didn't do a very good job this is a youtube poop transcript let's hope
[11381.14s -> 11396.06s]  for no more surprises i want to shoot somebody with this thing but watch me not even shoot one
[11396.06s -> 11400.54s]  person the whole game with that weapon it's probably gonna happen i would not be surprised
[11401.50s -> 11434.74s]  oh yellow diamond i needed that one that's a good one was there anything else out here
[11435.30s -> 11441.14s]  let me just check down here or something i feel like let me take a look at my cheating map
[11441.78s -> 11477.71s]  there is look at that where is it oh it's right there hell yeah how can you play so late at night
[11477.71s -> 11487.01s]  and not be scared um i don't know if you were here an hour ago but uh i was it got me a few
[11487.09s -> 11500.38s]  times at least my camera seems to have auto adjusted though because now it's kind of weirdly
[11500.38s -> 11554.34s]  lit in here um is there already get the emblem no i didn't this webcam is like three pixels what
[11554.34s -> 11563.38s]  happened to the one you had in november i have only increased the payments for webcams over the
[11563.38s -> 11571.98s]  last six months i started with a c920 and i used it for years i then bought a logitech brio
[11573.20s -> 11581.12s]  which was way more expensive than the c920 and then i bought the razor one which was i believe
[11581.12s -> 11588.72s]  even more expensive than the brio so i just keep adding i just keep throwing money at this problem
[11589.68s -> 11599.98s]  and it doesn't seem to be fixing it this like corporate andy over here is there a problem
[11600.46s -> 11605.26s]  yeah here just i don't know just take that and make it better take that and make it a little
[11605.26s -> 11613.65s]  better for me it didn't work well whatever i don't know just take more of it wait i'm supposed to be
[11613.65s -> 11621.62s]  looking my immersion i think this one looks fine i think this one looks the best out of the three
[11621.62s -> 11659.81s]  of them there's also really dark in here that's come on we gotta be fair what i didn't know that's
[11659.81s -> 11688.54s]  what that was a beautiful lighting effect go on down here oh that's a lot of you hold on hold on
[11689.94s -> 11731.63s]  wait till they jump down before you walk over here very nice somebody behind me more fun to
[11731.63s -> 11742.88s]  play in the dark i actually really don't like no no no no no no no i actually don't really like
[11743.52s -> 11752.34s]  bright ass lights really lit up really bright rooms and i hate it it kind of hurts my head
[11755.07s -> 11763.22s]  this room has light in it it's a little lit up but i um i much prefer it slightly dim
[11764.88s -> 11775.87s]  no it's not dark dark in here but it is dim i prefer it that way i would wear sunglasses all
[11775.87s -> 11784.74s]  the time i would be this i would do that i feel like having a little bit of tint darker is just
[11784.74s -> 11829.17s]  makes me feel better what is going on here what is going on where are these people oh stop throwing
[11829.57s -> 11852.94s]  how did i light on fire we gotta go this guy is so bad jesus
[11867.28s -> 11896.64s]  one down more like 10 that guy got in my head because i missed three shots i gotta hold
[11896.64s -> 11926.74s]  didn't i get a yellow herb bolts bolts for the bolt thrower i wonder if that was stupid why are
[11926.74s -> 11955.15s]  you so red because i got a lot of blood i'm gonna try it you can retrieve the ammo which is good yeah
[11955.15s -> 11965.10s]  what does it even look like let's i'm gonna shoot it okay that's pretty cool can i pick
[11965.10s -> 11980.38s]  them up indefinitely what's the reload on it really long very long let's check it out
[11980.38s -> 12007.90s]  kind of blink uh oh that's a good grab good luck finding someone big enough to use this thing
[12012.03s -> 12021.07s]  why do i have so much blood i'm just very very my circulation is very good i have very good
[12021.07s -> 12031.60s]  circulation except my hands get cold all right this is blue medallions and we can actually cheat
[12032.32s -> 12046.66s]  i bought the deluxe edition uh okay actually i should probably heal but
[12046.66s -> 12051.15s]  and let's just go for it you guys already uh this this is one of the coolest parts of the
[12051.15s -> 12057.15s]  game if you guys don't know so in here see all these crows a huge raven boss flies down here
[12057.79s -> 12062.51s]  and picks you up by the back that's why there's all these birds and shit and you have to fight
[12062.51s -> 12068.51s]  the bird while you're flying around um it's unbelievable it was really really cool
[12069.23s -> 12072.91s]  in the regular game i'm just really curious how they do it in this one
[12073.71s -> 12077.55s]  because like you actually have to fight and shoot the bird well it's like it's like clawing you back
[12077.55s -> 12081.15s]  and stuff and it like swings around you go past the church and past buildings this whole aerial
[12081.15s -> 12112.70s]  fight there you go can i take the bolts out yep this thing's actually kind of good i actually
[12112.70s -> 12178.43s]  this is actually pretty good okay we're good all right here we go where's the bird um in a minute
[12178.43s -> 12217.95s]  i had it wrong i see you took care of a request well done i can't believe they cut the iconic
[12217.95s -> 12224.42s]  bird fight i don't think they did now there are enough weapons here to get a party going
[12231.42s -> 12237.15s]  sell them an extra cash upgrade weapon do you do use uh-huh get all the expenses you put back
[12237.15s -> 12261.33s]  into it okay well you've proven yourself reliable what you're buying what a good ring rubies all
[12261.33s -> 12269.42s]  rubbish it makes no difference the price well that's our choice to make well these you just
[12269.42s -> 12279.98s]  get rid of these for selling only that's good a deal well struck take these two vipers well done
[12279.98s -> 12300.43s]  stranger and one more viper i still use all this stuff you're much good in here sure there's some
[12300.43s -> 12309.25s]  things money can't i think i'm gonna buy with this right this is probably not a bad idea
[12312.66s -> 12322.70s]  i don't think it's a bad idea i'm gonna get it you can't go wrong with that all right bolt
[12322.70s -> 12330.88s]  thrower probably maybe ammo capacity ready to fire are in good hands mate i'll see you right
[12330.88s -> 12340.78s]  i'll just make this thing deadly yeah this thing is filthy now an idea of your tastes

[14614.54s -> 14626.93s]  okay but what i use i wouldn't say that's worth three golden coins are there even any other
[14626.93s -> 14639.71s]  rarities in the game well i can't get many i can't get any more gold coins from this
[14640.59s -> 14656.34s]  there's probably more later i need to go into my inventory that was really fun though that's cool
[14661.02s -> 14666.90s]  mix the coins up next time well three but i mean three gold coins that should give you something
[14666.90s -> 14679.92s]  i am bright i can look over and see in the obs preview i am red what happened well that blood
[14679.92s -> 14692.94s]  came up to my face okay so customized case i should probably put this one on then right this
[14692.94s -> 14707.38s]  is you get more do i want more handgun ammo or more money probably money are we done for today
[14707.38s -> 14733.42s]  not yet i mean i feel like that's pretty good they stack don't i craft shotgun shells all the time
[14734.06s -> 14746.32s]  yeah this is a cool idea i like it this is a cool addition uh speaking of crafting breaks over i
[14746.96s -> 14778.21s]  let's go ahead and do that now i need gunpowder okay let's keep going i don't really have any
[14778.21s -> 14798.91s]  money i did what i wanted to do and let's continue okay um should heal with the herb um i will
[14798.91s -> 14812.82s]  eventually so the i have a question listen the the bird boss right how come the bird boss didn't
[14814.46s -> 14824.80s]  activate you know why did the bird boss not activate right you know what i mean it's it's
[14824.80s -> 14848.62s]  different okay you're good you're good okay on the way back okay this is really really great so far
[14848.62s -> 14864.75s]  it's really good i mean this game is just phenomenal on regardless of what version it is
[14865.31s -> 14872.03s]  but it does feel pretty great to come back to this so we talked about how i wish i could like
[14872.03s -> 14880.34s]  wipe my memory and play all the from software games again this kind of feels like that so this
[14880.34s -> 14896.43s]  is really cool really enjoying it so far is anything i do anything hey is that the right dock
[14897.23s -> 14921.04s]  i don't i don't think so there you are i can't do anything else here i think i just have to leave

[15176.48s -> 15184.00s]  learn right now if you miss something during the stream then i am red like this has to change now
[15184.00s -> 15204.91s]  like this is ridiculous my room is red right now it's not me i swear it's the color correction on
[15204.91s -> 15219.71s]  the camera see what i mean look look what just happened this is what it actually looks like in
[15219.71s -> 15231.76s]  here it looks like i still am red i'm a red i'm a whatever it's too late to get annoyed by this
[15232.32s -> 15257.50s]  that's better that's fine that's fine you need to put the hero filter on to match this
[15260.35s -> 15269.30s]  i don't care there's so much blood swirling around in here i told you guys that people like oh wow
[15270.18s -> 15277.94s]  how can you stay so thin i mean how do you stay like that you must exercise no guys i burn so
[15277.94s -> 15286.82s]  many calories just by existing i swear to you my body is just constantly just revved up machine
[15287.54s -> 15293.38s]  i have these dreams that are real life up here it's like i burned more calories than i in my
[15293.38s -> 15299.92s]  dreams than i do when i'm awake i'm constantly my body is constantly just producing energy
[15303.04s -> 15309.28s]  if you like put two little wires on me i could probably power a fucking clock like a potato
[15319.95s -> 15329.84s]  he's flexing on all us normal people that that did sound a little braggy that sounded a little
[15329.84s -> 15336.82s]  braggy but that's not what i meant by that that was that was a little braggy okay i admit but
[15336.82s -> 15355.90s]  that's not what i mean all right back to it i got everything right jeez germa i wish i had super
[15355.90s -> 15412.10s]  powers too shit hey can you shoot the water um no no i'm good i'm if i'm shooting the water
[15412.10s -> 15433.82s]  might be kind of funny though i was not in there before was it interesting okay this stuff is in
[15433.82s -> 15446.88s]  different places now what is in here it's random wait it's not placed individually it's random
[15446.88s -> 15456.64s]  i didn't know it was random i thought there was actually place there come on fill the tank when
[15456.64s -> 15465.68s]  you're done get me out here most resident evil games were that way i don't remember them being
[15465.68s -> 15483.10s]  random i guess certain key placement is certain items are there not random need two more of those
[15483.10s -> 15505.58s]  nice well i'm about to craft one of these anyways so let's go i'm gonna blow through these i think
[15505.58s -> 15515.47s]  at some point here not enough gunpowder reroll the loot shoot the water that was pretty good
[15515.47s -> 15526.10s]  louie i don't want to reroll it all right back to did i get everything oh wait a minute this is
[15526.10s -> 15561.02s]  what 10 extra dollars buys you or is it under the dock yesterday please turn the thanos filter off

[15632.51s -> 15646.90s]  oh my goodness oh my goodness run i got him where's my where's my bolt where's my bolt
[15649.57s -> 15718.98s]  get off me this gun is fucking stupid do it it's not that bad i did lose one of my bolts though
[15718.98s -> 15745.31s]  i don't know why they're in the water somewhere whatever right right right i didn't do it right
[15745.31s -> 15790.27s]  but i tried it's too late to do that dude stop there's so much more money and shit down here
[15790.27s -> 15808.96s]  yeah keep going where i came from right yeah i don't know you're going to blow up like the
[15808.96s -> 15827.97s]  guy from big trouble in little china what why do i why do i know what that is do i know what that
[15827.97s -> 15891.42s]  is that's a classic movie swing what the hell oh whoa they're behind me oh somebody swung at me
[15891.42s -> 15945.81s]  where'd they go see that did you see the axe when i what it was weird sit down oh i need to
[15945.81s -> 15957.71s]  there we go good that should free up some space it didn't free up any space i need to craft some
[15957.71s -> 15972.06s]  shit uh all right i'm gonna go two two green herbs just free up some space you look like a very tired
[15972.06s -> 16003.87s]  john wick yeah i'm thinking i'm back what you told me i'm gonna say something if you say it like
[16003.87s -> 16010.21s]  you don't you can't minus two that many times you'll crash my computer don't do that you're
[16010.21s -> 16033.84s]  gonna crash my computer if you do that stop i hear beeps oh my god thank goodness i didn't do that
[16034.56s -> 16047.86s]  if you say that was funny and then you write minus two it is automatically not counted
[16047.86s -> 16052.78s]  i just want to make sure you understand that but the algorithm picks up if you said like how
[16052.78s -> 16072.56s]  omega l minus two and that does not count you negate it i understand the appeal of this thing
[16072.56s -> 16077.52s]  and i'm starting to get why it's kind of cool because it's effectively infinite ammo if you're
[16077.52s -> 16098.50s]  good at shooting which i don't know how good i am with that where is this beep sure it's good
[16098.50s -> 16112.88s]  for stealth uh there's one more of those where is it where's this medallion i think it's probably
[16112.88s -> 16131.89s]  on the outside oh chest i can't carry any more of these i'm just gonna eat one of them where's
[16131.89s -> 16162.83s]  that medallion there it is last one need one more just a lot of these i can't take anymore
[16162.83s -> 16202.51s]  an egg boat fuel go back to the boat who just puts an egg in their pocket this is a little
[16202.51s -> 16215.38s]  weird but is it really stays fresh i don't like it as long as you don't break it i'm gonna leave
[16215.38s -> 16243.87s]  that there in case i need to eat it later you look like you want revenge today oh my god be careful
[16243.87s -> 16309.98s]  but i just ripped it oops a lot of money all right back to the boat i wonder how much harder
[16309.98s -> 16327.26s]  hard hardcore is because the parry makes hardcore i think not as bad it's a lot harder oh well i
[16327.26s -> 16332.70s]  think with the parry that would be wouldn't be too awful as long as you did the parry right okay i
[16332.70s -> 16352.85s]  gotta go back up this way it's too hard you're a baby you know about me anyways what do you know
[16352.85s -> 16375.39s]  about me what do you know about me too much somebody said uh i want to save the game because
[16375.39s -> 16381.38s]  i'm a little concerned that i'm gonna get killed here and i don't want to go all the way back i
[16381.38s -> 16393.10s]  don't think there's a checkpoint before this so i'm gonna save don't listen to the haters you did
[16393.10s -> 16420.35s]  nancy drew on senior mode yeah yes i did what am i going idiot i want to go back oh it's this way
[16420.91s -> 16440.27s]  did i get any more trinkets to sell because i kind of want to upgrade the shotgun
[16443.07s -> 16453.44s]  took care of a request did you i knew i could count on you oh what you're buying a well-tuned
[16453.44s -> 16471.47s]  weapon can make up for a lack of skill friend this kind of work is about finesse stranger little
[16471.47s -> 16479.71s]  b goes a long way you see did i already do the viper thing did i do the viper thing already
[16481.07s -> 16490.10s]  pleasure doing business with you that should be it right all right cool a job well done deserves
[16490.10s -> 16497.92s]  payment in kind where would it what can i do you there's some things money can't buy
[16498.88s -> 16502.42s]  i'm not sure i'm not sure it's kind of cool maybe should i see what is better
[16503.06s -> 16519.76s]  or just get the laser sight treasure map i think i already have it it's a bad gun i think i already
[16519.76s -> 16528.21s]  have the treasure map because i have the lux edition are you guys lying or is that real let's
[16528.21s -> 16540.11s]  get the laser yeah laser sights you can't come back anytime okay i need this laser sight didn't
[16540.11s -> 16547.57s]  this used to take up inventory space did they change that i thought it took up inventory space
[16548.86s -> 16559.90s]  it still does it does i thought it was an actual item in the oh it is right there okay yeah yep
[16559.90s -> 16605.44s]  okay do i want to store anything i'm all right oh i got a bonus why is it so dark in your room
[16605.44s -> 16609.28s]  uh because i turned the lights off because it's a scary game well relatively scary
[16610.08s -> 16615.31s]  you can turn it up a little bit now though there that's a little bit
[16618.86s -> 16626.29s]  sell the necklace please uh i don't want to sell the necklace because i want to fill it welcome
[16626.93s -> 16631.97s]  got a selection of good things i want a full necklace because then it's probably worth like
[16631.97s -> 16637.97s]  40 grand she makes no difference the price at the treasure map that's our choice i have a yellow
[16637.97s -> 16649.04s]  but it's not the right size it needs to be a square or rectangle okay let's do this part
[16649.76s -> 16665.73s]  i'm now confident i have a save point i'm good let's go or something maybe i should just store
[16665.73s -> 16681.94s]  this yeah i like it but taking up a lot of space right now you have the stench of i also need to
[16683.14s -> 16686.50s]  i need to i need to throw some flashbang these things are just taking up so much space
[16687.14s -> 16695.23s]  throw some flashbangs throw some grenades why are these not in a stack like these are
[16695.23s -> 16711.39s]  what these are in a stack of four why is that how come these won't stack oh oh that's a hot key
[16712.19s -> 16719.54s]  that's okay i see i can't store the bolts and i don't want to throw the bolts away because
[16720.50s -> 16735.55s]  how am i going to get any more i don't think you can store um ammo put it down yeah i can't
[16735.55s -> 16748.48s]  store it that's okay i have plenty of room uh i got plenty of ammo i wouldn't want to use this
[16748.48s -> 16752.16s]  here anyways because i would lose all the i'd lose all the bolts anyways all right let's go
[16752.72s -> 16769.89s]  i'm ready uh probably gonna call it after this encounter here i did say i wanted to put a kind
[16769.89s -> 16777.12s]  of a cap on it to some point before 3am so here's what's gonna happen i'm very happy to play this
[16777.12s -> 16782.02s]  i'm i cannot wait to keep playing it i'm very excited to continue playing it so here's the
[16782.02s -> 16790.40s]  plan for this weekend this weekend we're gonna go probably very long on saturday uh saturday is
[16790.40s -> 16794.99s]  probably going to be a long stream i'm going to really grind this out on saturday sunday is going
[16794.99s -> 16802.96s]  to be another stream where i really kind of grind it out on sunday i think that's probably i should
[16802.96s -> 16808.30s]  be able to beat it in another three streams or so but i here's the thing i don't want to rush this
[16808.30s -> 16812.16s]  so i've been obviously this game's awesome it's probably one of the best games it's going to come
[16812.16s -> 16820.86s]  out this whole year i'm going to take my time with it so we'll see i'm imagining i'll probably
[16820.86s -> 16830.26s]  stream it at least probably four or five times yeah it won't be like this uh on saturday because
[16830.26s -> 16835.49s]  i had to start really really late today because it came out really late i was just itching to play
[16835.49s -> 16860.08s]  it so loud are you gonna do a massive bong rip on cam for 420 i don't think so this is so loud
[16860.08s -> 16939.50s]  why did it get so much louder okay yes you didn't say no throw harpoons right in the mouth where you
[16939.50s -> 16954.00s]  going where you going where you going where is he whoa how do i turn up what do i go all right why
[16954.00s -> 16996.34s]  is this not driving oh i ran into there what you can swallow me i'm moving oh shit come on aim better
[16996.34s -> 17111.65s]  god damn it whoa what the hell oh that hurt there it is just as easy as it was in the original
[17111.65s -> 17132.64s]  it's a cool fight though i like it shades you're playing on the baby mode no i'm playing on
[17133.28s -> 17159.31s]  standard okay that was interesting it's late at night i don't care i'm gonna tell you um i
[17162.34s -> 17167.70s]  i just was leaning back and i was i kind of put my hand well on like the kind of bottom lower back
[17167.70s -> 17173.06s]  part of my back just to kind of stretch a little and i ended up i kind of with my other thumb
[17173.06s -> 17179.46s]  lifted kind of my pants and went i kind of pulled them out a little like oh i'm just gonna like the
[17179.46s -> 17186.43s]  elastic here i'm gonna pull back it was like 180 degree air that just came out that was hot
[17186.43s -> 17195.47s]  it was burning hot air that just came from that area that was like hot like burning hot
[17196.03s -> 17208.64s]  i'm telling you i am on fire all day people think i'm a liar i'm i like i'm just like on fire
[17208.64s -> 17236.74s]  take 80 come on you're sweating dude shit yourself oh my god that's so stupid dude have you had a
[17236.74s -> 17238.74s]  fever for the last 10 years
[17280.96s -> 17289.23s]  they're even on in my nightmares i don't know if you would have the sunglasses on in a nightmare
[17289.79s -> 17295.26s]  these things are welded to his head this is part of his body those are just his eyes
[17307.20s -> 17323.25s]  you wouldn't condor wonder roost do you read me condor one you've been radio silent for three
[17323.25s -> 17331.42s]  hours are you all right yeah i'm fine why did you sleep in the boat i'm still looking for whatever
[17331.42s -> 17339.09s]  key i need copy that i mean once that big monster is dead i feel like it's probably relatively
[17339.09s -> 17344.86s]  safe out there in the boat kind of away from all the crazy shit like once you get rid of the big
[17344.86s -> 17350.46s]  monster just be right in the middle of the lake and just go to bed i think you'd be pretty safe
[17351.18s -> 17358.38s]  unless there's a second monster which look i feel like the first monster encounter would have woken
[17358.38s -> 17363.74s]  up the second monster so there's definitely no second monster there's no way you sleep through
[17363.74s -> 17370.06s]  that if you're a second monster you're a second monster you hear that and you go investigate be
[17370.06s -> 17383.49s]  going anywhere in this thing uh i'm gonna wrap it up here i'm gonna just get to another save point
[17383.49s -> 17419.17s]  which i think this one probably right here soon okay i thought that was a demon or something i
[17419.17s -> 17423.10s]  thought this thing attacked me i thought it was a giant moth i was like what do they add to the
[17423.10s -> 17450.05s]  game why is it what is this i do like the little additions here and there though it's very fun
[17450.69s -> 17501.97s]  okay that's where i came from go over here it's just like hurt my eyes what are you doing i would
[17501.97s -> 17507.33s]  somebody said cs go maneuver yeah i was trying to flash him because i think they're up on the hill
[17507.89s -> 17514.85s]  imagine you're like doing like a religious chant and up on the hill like it's some crazy cult or
[17514.85s -> 17521.28s]  something else like a flashbang lands in front of you would you notice or would you be still
[17521.28s -> 17532.42s]  doing this and what would happen do you stop the chant or is it like oh we gotta keep going like
[17532.42s -> 17554.96s]  we can't stop how does that work i was wondering what they were gonna look like in the remake
[17555.28s -> 17674.51s]  what is this place some kind of shrine same mark from the church okay i need need an item here
[17674.51s -> 17714.21s]  i do not have okay monster investigate the two locations okay i have to investigate the
[17715.25s -> 17729.62s]  over there investigate the over there very cool let's go good morning oh that's right it is
[17729.62s -> 17739.44s]  probably morning for you right morning eu and good afternoon australia those of you that know

[17768.82s -> 17778.16s]  ridiculous to me just how um it's how far ahead australia is from the west coast of the united
[17778.16s -> 17785.81s]  states wait what am i what's going on here investigate the two locations because i gotta
[17785.81s -> 17794.46s]  go up here the boat doesn't work though wait come here did i screw this up i messed this up
[17794.46s -> 17823.98s]  didn't i think i have to go this way make yourself red i mean i already am pretty red right now if
[17823.98s -> 17837.66s]  you get ready for school young man i still have school dreams i didn't see this oops okay sometimes
[17837.66s -> 17844.05s]  i have dreams where oh no i gotta turn a paper in it's like dude i have not been in a classroom
[17844.05s -> 17852.67s]  like 15 to 20 years and i still think that i'm like wait oh i didn't turn my paper in
[17853.31s -> 17869.42s]  i'm fucked and it's like i wake up and i'm like i'm like 40 yeah like i don't look like moths okay
[17869.42s -> 17881.87s]  someone fetch me a rare golden chicken egg what will i do with it well sometimes it's more fun
[17881.87s -> 17901.70s]  not knowing those drop pretty frequently from what i remember all right i want to go if i
[17901.70s -> 17926.59s]  remember this let me see i think this stuff over here there is i do remember the boat what was in
[17926.59s -> 17934.32s]  here i think it's like a jewel or something there we go all right i just made like 40 grand
[17937.98s -> 17967.68s]  i can oh i can complete that um necklace whatever it is red nine that thing's pretty good from what
[17967.68s -> 17977.20s]  i remember i might just upgrade that thing to full that gun used to be the beast that that is the
[17977.20s -> 17980.80s]  right one right that's the one that you just always use that one they probably fixed it they
[17980.80s -> 17991.31s]  probably changed it so the other stuff is better i remember that thing was unstoppable okay i
[17991.31s -> 18012.61s]  need honestly i need to i need to save where's the nearest safe point i'm gonna go this way
[18012.61s -> 18021.15s]  probably in here wait a minute he was gonna go to bed 20 minutes ago i need up i need a safe point
[18021.87s -> 18062.34s]  get out of the way if you don't save i will drink it to sonny whoa i'm going i'm going i'm going
[18064.69s -> 18087.30s]  what what come on dude what are you talking about you know i actually holly and i did a water taste
[18087.30s -> 18098.35s]  test just for fun one day and i don't remember i think dasani was not even that low for me yeah
[18098.35s -> 18105.98s]  well we we just do things sometimes we just hang out together i forget what my my favorite one was
[18105.98s -> 18128.86s]  my number one was that dasani was not even really that low it was pretty low but it wasn't like f
[18130.08s -> 18136.48s]  i probably would surprise people with where i put something i'm gonna i'm gonna get punched in the
[18136.48s -> 18151.23s]  face for saying this i think i'm good someone is going to to be very upset with me there they go
[18151.23s -> 18166.10s]  they're already punching there look at they're already punching um core water is like i think
[18166.10s -> 18183.06s]  it was like pretty low i didn't really like core water the one with the blue cap it's blue it's
[18183.06s -> 18201.41s]  kind of slim looks like it's like a got a blue twist off big blue twist off cap yeah um what
[18201.41s -> 18213.39s]  did i give i wait i gave dasani a b no i gave no i didn't i gave dasani a b no no no no no
[18213.39s -> 18227.54s]  that's wrong that's wrong it's wrong it's wrong that's not smart water was an a you're sleep
[18227.54s -> 18236.91s]  deprived show the list we don't really have a list now dasani was what dasani was was a c
[18238.61s -> 18249.28s]  but core was was the lowest for me what would you what about tap water depends on where you
[18249.28s -> 18257.15s]  fucking live i mean this some tap water like tastes very different i don't know i like vegas
[18257.15s -> 18263.62s]  tap water versus like california tap water versus like hawaii tap water versus massachusetts tap
[18263.62s -> 18273.38s]  water it's i don't i don't know very different new york city tap water yeah it's very different
[18273.38s -> 18284.99s]  new york city tap water versus vegas tap water i assure you is very different oh my goodness okay
[18284.99s -> 18291.58s]  i water our water is fine whatever i don't prefer it asani though smart water is usually what i would
[18291.58s -> 18299.18s]  want fiji okay fiji doesn't count for me because fiji would just blow everything away i don't think
[18299.18s -> 18306.96s]  i i i don't think i'm allowed to put it on the list because i don't know isn't fiji fiji's like
[18306.96s -> 18318.13s]  you can't even come close i don't buy fiji though i don't actually buy it you know where i buy fiji
[18318.13s -> 18326.83s]  water it's one of the only places i buy it the airport that's it i don't ever buy it anywhere
[18326.83s -> 18334.67s]  else it's just at the airport and it's funny because fiji's already kind of expensive isn't it
[18334.67s -> 18340.05s]  so it's even more expensive at the airport so i'm buying arguably one of the more expensive
[18340.05s -> 18349.42s]  waters on earth at the most expensive place on earth it's like the water is very very expensive
[18349.42s -> 18360.00s]  in the airport vacation packaging crystal geyser is s actually i would probably agree with you
[18362.48s -> 18375.74s]  all right that's a weird flex no i just i just told you i don't buy it i buy it at the airport
[18375.74s -> 18380.64s]  which is just like oh yeah sure fiji you know what it is because you want to make sure like anytime
[18380.64s -> 18388.08s]  i travel i want to make sure that i am in peak performance mode peak physical hydration peak
[18388.08s -> 18394.61s]  mental fortitude and a fiji water to me is like all right that is that's good shit and i'm going
[18394.61s -> 18399.79s]  to make sure i drink that because i i'm about to go on an airplane i wanted to be the best
[18399.79s -> 18409.18s]  because i'm going on a plane i planes suck already everybody knows that all right we'll see you
[18409.18s -> 18429.31s]  saturday i need to be peak performance to get on a plane doesn't matter remember what would you do
[18429.31s -> 18445.47s]  if you got the t-virus um i close myself off in a room and just i don't know like booby trap the
[18445.47s -> 18451.31s]  room i'm in because like the t-virus is going to get out of me and try to get out like it's
[18451.31s -> 18454.99s]  gonna be like an alien right so i'll just like booby trap the whole room just stay in there
[18455.63s -> 18460.11s]  and then eventually like it'll get out and i'd like run into the fucking home alone shit that
[18460.11s -> 18468.13s]  i made for it it won't know it'll it'll be like like out of my chest and go to the door like
[18469.49s -> 18476.22s]  and then a big paint can just hits right in the face and falls back onto the toy cars i put all
[18476.22s -> 18491.52s]  over the ground i would contain it his ass is not ready to stop streaming no i'm good i'm good it's
