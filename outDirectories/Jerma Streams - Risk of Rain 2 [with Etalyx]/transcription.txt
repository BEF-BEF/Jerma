[0.95s -> 8.25s]  Hello there. How you doing on this uh, fri- Thursday evening? Is it Thursday? It's Friday.
[11.32s -> 16.60s]  Uh, a little late today. I'm sorry. I've been so good too. I haven't ever since I opened up this
[16.60s -> 23.14s]  window with the three to four. I haven't been late for like six or seven weeks or something. It's
[23.14s -> 30.78s]  been great. But, uh, we're working together with Italics today. So we're kind of bouncing back and
[30.78s -> 34.38s]  forth. Hey, can you hear me? I can, I can't hear you. What are your audio levels like?
[35.34s -> 45.02s]  So we've been setting up and we're gonna play Risk of Rain 2 co-op. Everyone's talking about
[45.02s -> 51.14s]  this game. Apparently it's really good. I have not played it, but it looks very, very fun.
[53.75s -> 68.26s]  Risk of Rain plus two. It's very addictive. It's that's so, so I've heard. Did I play the original?
[69.06s -> 86.07s]  I played. No, I enjoyed the original vicariously because I like, I think I've played it a few times
[86.95s -> 93.66s]  randomly. I don't think I own it though, but I've seen people play it and I've watched people play
[93.66s -> 99.24s]  it and it looked really fun and I vicariously played the game through other people. Never really
[99.88s -> 106.50s]  gave it too much attention and I attribute that to the fact that this one is a third person 3D
[106.50s -> 111.93s]  perspective and the other one is the 2D side scrolling perspective and I like this
[112.73s -> 118.22s]  approach better. First game is apparently phenomenal and it looked phenomenal,
[118.22s -> 131.88s]  but no, I did not really play it. You know that the item effects stack and don't have a limit,
[131.88s -> 138.95s]  right? I have no idea. Italics is going to pretty much be here to be the guy that answers every
[138.95s -> 143.43s]  single question. So if you have a question tonight, ask Italics because he'll be able to answer it.
[144.79s -> 149.43s]  So for the purpose of the stream, if you have a Risk of Rain 2 question, please put in your
[149.51s -> 156.02s]  chat message, hey, it's Alix Dash, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and I will ask him
[156.02s -> 170.28s]  because I don't fucking know anything. No, questions that pertain to the video game, okay?
[172.81s -> 178.01s]  I'm not going to relay, it has to be a gameplay related question and if it's not, then mods,
[178.01s -> 183.43s]  clean them up. You know what I mean? Clean them up. If you don't know, clean them up is
[184.31s -> 192.71s]  germ of mob talk. Forget them out of here. But I think, oh, let's see if he's ready.
[193.35s -> 204.47s]  Hello? Are you here? Hello. Are you with me? I am indeed. All righty. Hold on, you seem a bit loud.
[206.06s -> 214.87s]  Right click me in Discord, turn me down. How about like right there? Okay. I'm not on a webcam,
[214.87s -> 222.25s]  Mike, right? I don't think so. Remember the whole time I was on a webcam, Mike? No, I'm not. No,
[222.25s -> 230.26s]  I don't think you are. However, do you want to check your dashboard and click the accept button?
[230.82s -> 240.97s]  Accept button? Where is it? Oh, this is just squads, man. Yeah, you are super loud. Hold on. Dude,
[240.97s -> 248.17s]  we're in like a Twitch squad right now. We just like squatted the fuck up. What does that even do?
[250.38s -> 258.18s]  All right, Chet. What that does is there's a button at the top of the stream
[259.46s -> 267.90s]  that is going to show our scores. No, we're hiding that information. Oh, I don't want to embarrass
[267.90s -> 272.38s]  you. So you don't want to embarrass yourself. I mean, that's that could happen too. You can like
[272.38s -> 278.54s]  click on the squad button up at the top and then it shows both streams at the same time like
[278.54s -> 285.26s]  multi-twitch and you even stay in the same chat room you were already in. What? But you see both
[285.98s -> 291.58s]  video feeds simultaneously and interchangeably click between them. Wait a minute. Wait, you lost
[291.58s -> 298.68s]  me here. Hold on. Both streams at the same time? They call it squads because when you're playing
[298.68s -> 306.33s]  Apex with your friends. Yes, you just said the Voldemort word. Now everyone's going to want us
[306.33s -> 314.58s]  to play Apex. Yeah, well, we'll go ahead and stop you there. So this is Risk of Rain 2.
[315.62s -> 319.94s]  All questions, by the way, please put hey italics dash and then your question because I won't be
[319.94s -> 326.98s]  able to answer it. I won't read it because I'm not in your stupid chat chatters. It's a nice chat.
[326.98s -> 329.78s]  That's kind of an unbelievable thing to open up with. That's fine.
[331.43s -> 340.95s]  Everyone's like, oh my god, stop it. All right, you ready? Let's try this out. So
[341.75s -> 348.65s]  this is a game about collecting items. It's a game about, I think, collecting bugs. Collecting bugs.
[349.29s -> 355.30s]  So we have to be the same character, right? We both have to be the same character.
[355.86s -> 363.53s]  There are six classes available, but they have to be unlocked. Okay, so double tap. Let's shoot
[363.61s -> 375.27s]  twice for two times 90% damage, which is 180% damage. Interesting. Okay, 180 damage phase round
[375.27s -> 382.02s]  fire piercing bolt that hits all enemies in line for 230% damage. Okay. Well, no, that would be
[382.02s -> 389.13s]  two. So there'd be like three and a half damage. How does it Hey, it's Alex. Hey, how does that
[389.13s -> 397.56s]  work? I've never played this game. Oh, right. I didn't even play the first game. Wait, hold on.
[397.56s -> 405.02s]  You didn't play the first game either? No. So we're both just total scrub assholes then.
[405.02s -> 413.21s]  I went through like a long, long tangent in the very beginning. Normally, I would be a good guide
[413.21s -> 420.97s]  for a new Wow, this is not good. This is not good. I do. He's usually the guide. He's usually like
[420.97s -> 426.70s]  the game guide. Everybody tell told me like, why haven't you played risk of rain? And I said,
[426.70s -> 431.98s]  because it's ugly and it's 2d and it's pixel art. And I hate those kind of games, as everybody knows.
[431.98s -> 437.21s]  Right. So now that it's 3d with graphics, I thought it's a perfect time to play. Well,
[437.21s -> 442.81s]  you missed out because it was I watched the streamer beat it. I'm not going to say names
[442.81s -> 448.18s]  here. But the name was star. They beat it on stream. And it was great. It was great content.
[448.18s -> 462.47s]  So we're playing on the rainstorm difficulty, which sounds very thematic. Okay, cool. Quote,
[462.47s -> 467.34s]  the way the game was intended to be played. Okay. So those of you guys that have not paid
[467.34s -> 473.85s]  attention at home, we've got a cross here. Sounds good. This is what is the $34? What's that mean?
[475.53s -> 481.91s]  It means we need. Oh, I have 16. Remember when we linked our bank account when we installed? Right.
[481.91s -> 488.36s]  Right. Right. Right. So it's just constantly cross referencing and checking and find and
[488.36s -> 493.34s]  activate. Basically, there's a direct line of credit to the loot boxes. Okay. So you get money.
[493.34s -> 496.30s]  Do I have to collect to collect the money or just is it just happening? Okay. People are starting
[496.30s -> 503.43s]  to come out here. Okay. That hurt. That's a dodge roll. And this is like a super shot. Okay. And
[503.43s -> 514.14s]  that's a phaser. So yeah, you have your default shoot. One of them is like a stun. Yeah, you got
[514.38s -> 523.45s]  like a three round burst. So does dodge have iframes? That's all I care about. I think you
[523.45s -> 531.66s]  just move so fast. It's physically impossible for anybody else to hit you. What I get personal
[531.66s -> 537.38s]  shield generator. I got a recharging shield now. I think we should probably leave, right? Oh, you're
[537.38s -> 550.60s]  like, I'm over here. I was just standing in like the starter area. Oops. So I don't know what any
[550.60s -> 553.96s]  item does. We're just going to pick stuff up at random. Shift is sprint. All right. So is there
[553.96s -> 560.92s]  like a we should probably stay together. That's great. Recharging shield. So just there's boxes
[560.92s -> 565.96s]  all over the ground. There's boxes all over the ground. And we're killing things and getting
[565.96s -> 573.53s]  money. There's also boxes on the ground that have money. Are you up? I'll come to you. So this is
[573.53s -> 578.87s]  the teleporter, right? Our goal is to find the teleporter. And whenever we want to activate it,
[578.87s -> 583.99s]  so we can stay here and grind for as long as we want. Really? The longer we stay the meter
[583.99s -> 590.31s]  at the top right. Sticky bond. It says easy gets progressively more difficult. Oh, interesting.
[590.87s -> 598.86s]  We're basically trying to superpower ourselves. And then when we're done doing that,
[598.86s -> 605.13s]  we move into the next levels. Yeah. So is it based on levels or is it? Hey, it's Alex. Hey,
[605.13s -> 612.50s]  is this based on levels or is it based on to just try to grind as hard as you can in one area?
[612.50s -> 624.62s]  Both, I think. Okay. All right. Do you got how much money you got? Have you? I've been
[624.62s -> 635.32s]  opening everything. I see. I'm going to come to you. I do like dodge roll. I have like a war
[635.32s -> 642.31s]  banner. How did you even get up there? I think I used a jump pad. A jump pad?
[642.95s -> 648.58s]  I'll activate teleporter. Don't touch that, right? Not unless we're absolutely ready.
[648.58s -> 656.86s]  No, we're not. Right. Are we ready? I don't know. How much money do you have? I have 72 bucks.
[656.86s -> 662.92s]  I have 34 dollars. I just bought something. I just got gasoline. Drop a war banner on leveling up,
[662.92s -> 668.28s]  giving you great strength. Okay. That's what I got. That's what that is. So if you like fight
[668.28s -> 676.39s]  inside of that, you get like bonus stats to everything. Interesting. Like attack speed up,
[677.59s -> 681.61s]  maybe damage. We should just hang out up here then just grind money.
[681.61s -> 685.93s]  Who cares? Well, if we run around the map, we can find more boxes to
[689.21s -> 699.59s]  purchase upgrades. Cool. Jerma thinks he's good at the game. I'm like asking questions. I'm asking
[699.59s -> 703.83s]  like, oh, okay, so we do this. What about this? What do we do about this? I think she's fucking
[703.83s -> 718.87s]  good at the game. I'm like asking questions. What'd you just do? This is an E3 presentation.
[719.99s -> 729.98s]  So what about over here? Hey, Taliesin, watch out for those skulls. They're dangerous.
[731.34s -> 733.10s]  You literally cut off. Hey, watch out for the...
[736.36s -> 742.84s]  Dying main character fails to communicate most important line of dialogue to new supporting
[743.64s -> 751.51s]  main character role. Easy. Am I gonna die? Oh no. I thought I just got killed. All right. Here's a
[751.51s -> 757.58s]  box. Open it. I do like this money system. Fire a swarm of missiles. I like getting paid all the
[757.58s -> 764.70s]  time too. Okay. I think we may have just spawned everything. Look at over here. One lunar. Okay.
[766.14s -> 770.94s]  We just spawned everything. Did you do like some kind of mountain? No. Like cursed item? What is
[770.94s -> 777.42s]  this? I don't know. I don't think so. I just picked it. I just picked an item up. You definitely did
[777.42s -> 783.74s]  this. I didn't. I swear to god I didn't do anything. It was a trap up here. I pressed the... I opened
[783.74s -> 794.81s]  up an orange case and got a new item. Can we stack these war banners? Do they like... Somebody said
[794.81s -> 799.45s]  apparently everything is stackable in the whole game. Really? I think so. So the whole point is
[799.45s -> 805.85s]  just becoming more overpowered. I guess, yeah. People are saying activate the teleporter.
[806.49s -> 812.02s]  Should we do that or should we wait till medium? I don't know. I guess we can just do it now and
[812.02s -> 819.13s]  see what happens. I mean we're pretty close to medium. I think we can handle it. Noticing more
[819.13s -> 825.45s]  elites popping up. Is that what the flame on the head means? I think the flame on the head. I have
[825.45s -> 834.25s]  like an ability that sets it on fire. Deleting elite monster items. 3D printer. Oh I think I can
[834.25s -> 842.55s]  just deal extra damage to bosses. Cool. So are there headshots in this game? Now obviously these
[842.55s -> 846.79s]  enemies are only head. Yeah. It doesn't feel like there is. They might be. They might be.
[848.06s -> 852.94s]  But I don't think there is. All right. Teleporter. Are we going to just activate it?
[852.94s -> 858.18s]  Might as well just see what it does. Hey there is fall damage. How bad is it on a scale of one to
[858.18s -> 865.35s]  ten? Uh two. Okay let's say I was like one is I jump off of the ledge and ten is I jump off of
[865.35s -> 876.86s]  like a building. Um can you can you go over that like scale again? How bad is it? The joke the joke
[876.86s -> 882.86s]  is that... Scale of one. The joke is... Jump off of a ledge. The joke is that is the scale. So like
[882.86s -> 890.17s]  it would be like four and it was fucking hilarious. You should see my chat right now. I activated the
[890.17s -> 893.61s]  teleporter. No most time when like somebody says something fucking dumb or weird you see like a
[893.61s -> 897.69s]  bunch of question marks. I don't know about what's going on in your stream but that's like a ton of
[897.69s -> 903.14s]  laughs. All right so that's the boss. Stone Titan. I don't think the question marks are laughs.
[903.14s -> 915.93s]  Chris Vanguard. Uh he's killing me. Just don't die. Uh okay I'll deal with the adds. Don't don't say
[915.93s -> 924.70s]  that. What? What would you classify these as? Are we running ads right now? No don't say that
[924.70s -> 930.06s]  word. Don't do not say the word add. No but like you said it in the context of like the advertisement.
[930.06s -> 938.55s]  Are you dead? Can I get you? I'm dead. How do I revive you? We should have done it earlier.
[941.00s -> 946.92s]  We should have activated the easy mode earlier. Easy mode. They got fragged. Enter the teleporter.
[946.92s -> 952.70s]  Hold on but is there a way I can get you back or are you actually just dead? I think I'm actually
[952.78s -> 960.52s]  just dead. Interesting okay. I come back at the end of the level so good luck. There's no way I'm
[960.52s -> 965.88s]  gonna beat this. I can 100% guarantee that this is not going to be completed. Just line them all up
[965.88s -> 972.57s]  and get a collateral. I mean I'm trying. Okay well that was a good try. You did go narrowly right
[972.57s -> 977.93s]  through every other. Hey it's hard when you got fucking 100 people. What is this? What are your
[977.93s -> 993.67s]  like fireworks? It's my special move. There's too many of these heads. This is not even the boss.
[994.39s -> 999.43s]  Is this why when I looked over everyone was saying teleporter teleporter teleporter teleporter
[1000.70s -> 1006.47s]  I'm minus one health. Oh that means I'm dead. Good now I don't feel so bad.
[1006.47s -> 1013.91s]  We can die together in eternal bliss. Medium on the first level. That apparently was not a good
[1013.91s -> 1026.50s]  idea. So can we just keep going? Yeah I think we just try to get good. All right let's go. Let's
[1026.50s -> 1031.86s]  do it. Let's get good. I don't know if you know I just I just beat Sekiro on stream like last week.
[1031.86s -> 1035.54s]  I don't know if you know that but I mean obviously you know that. How many times did you die? Because
[1035.54s -> 1039.70s]  that's how many times we have to die here before we can beat this game. I act like we didn't talk
[1039.70s -> 1046.98s]  about it downstairs. Yeah I was just wanting you to repeat it for everyone else to hear.
[1046.98s -> 1054.78s]  All right you out of your egg? No. Well come on we gotta go. It's like it's time. Okay. You can't
[1054.78s -> 1059.42s]  just sit in there. I'm going. All right we gotta find teleporter and win go quick. That hurts by
[1059.42s -> 1063.34s]  the way. I don't think we're supposed to find the teleporter first. There's actual team damage.
[1064.66s -> 1069.91s]  You know what I'm just gonna blame the RNG. Okay the drops the drops were terrible.
[1069.91s -> 1074.55s]  Now blame the fact that we didn't we were supposed to just activate the teleporter.
[1074.55s -> 1081.70s]  Keep going. This is a game about speed. We have to split up a little bit because we have to find the
[1081.70s -> 1095.78s]  teleporter. Yeah we do have to find the teleporter. You're right. There we go. I'm just trying to get
[1095.78s -> 1101.40s]  some money. Imagine this game on insane difficulty. I didn't have a shield like you did. That's why I
[1101.40s -> 1107.82s]  died so fast. Can you imagine this game on insane? That definitely is an insane difficulty. It has to
[1107.82s -> 1116.68s]  be. There is one higher than this. This game is a race against the difficulty. This is what twitch user
[1118.57s -> 1124.01s]  uh I don't know what was their name. This game is a race. I don't know. Please cite your sources.
[1124.01s -> 1131.43s]  Thank you. That was that was your homework on Wikipedia right now. What was their name?
[1132.23s -> 1137.18s]  Taco Tangler. There's no enemies in this game. All right so if you have a if you have a question
[1137.98s -> 1142.14s]  ask Taco Tay. I want everyone to add to preface their questions. Hey Taco Tangler.
[1142.70s -> 1159.11s]  Yeah we're using MLA or Chicago style. Chicago style is the hot dog? What did you just say? Foreign
[1159.11s -> 1164.17s]  fruit heal on use. Interesting. I told you to cite your sources. I didn't know which one you were
[1164.17s -> 1171.67s]  using. We're doing hot dog style. Oh all right. We let's go. We're gonna find no more like funny
[1171.67s -> 1176.87s]  jokes. The teleporter is right here. All right let's activate it right now. Why not? Can we? Yeah I get
[1176.87s -> 1183.43s]  it. We're so weak. But let's go. All right you asked for it. See now we kill it. There's not we're
[1183.43s -> 1192.34s]  not going to get overwhelmed. Kill it quick. Headshots only. Giant ant. Told you we were
[1192.34s -> 1202.76s]  collecting bugs. What is this thing? Speaking of bugs I have like a bug that's healing me or
[1202.76s -> 1207.46s]  something. Hold on I'm gonna go stand over here with your heal bug. I think I have. That hurt a
[1207.46s -> 1215.56s]  lot. Is this a heal bug? Oh god. I just used my heal and nothing happened. I think I'm gonna
[1215.56s -> 1218.92s]  heal right now. Am I dead again? Oh you're dead? All right let me see if I can do this. Told you we
[1218.92s -> 1230.52s]  should have done this. Well look he's at like 40% HP. My heal did not do anything. Oh my god.
[1231.16s -> 1236.17s]  I thought we're not ready. We gotta have more like power-ups before we activate this.
[1237.37s -> 1242.73s]  Oh that was a personal shield. We might we might actually maybe I just killed my healer. All right
[1242.73s -> 1252.60s]  personal goals for today. Beat level one. Personal goal. Complete level one. I'll get it. It's harder
[1252.60s -> 1271.32s]  than Monster Hunter. Come on give me that heal. Give me that heal. How funny would it be if it was the exact
[1271.32s -> 1280.26s]  same problem this Monster Hunter? This is like four player difficulty. I'm dead. The bug doesn't
[1280.26s -> 1287.30s]  heal. The bug doesn't heal. Well I I had an actual heal in my pocket that didn't heal. Hey Taco Tangler!
[1288.10s -> 1293.58s]  Uh what's what are we doing wrong here? We're on the wrong difficulty? I think we just I think we
[1293.58s -> 1299.27s]  need some more power-ups. We gotta split up. Get money. Let's let's say like open at least five
[1299.35s -> 1308.04s]  boxes each. All right five boxes each. Minimum. Just get more items but don't let it go all the
[1308.04s -> 1313.56s]  way into like medium territory. Okay yeah five boxes is too much. Be fast. What does Taco Tangler
[1313.56s -> 1321.18s]  say? This is a he's the expert. Grab a few chests and level a little bit before activating the
[1321.18s -> 1324.86s]  teleporter. Then once the event is over you can get the remaining items. All right that sounds good.
[1325.42s -> 1337.46s]  Thanks Taco Tangler. That wasn't even Taco Tangler. Somebody else. Wait Taco Tangler left.
[1337.46s -> 1340.90s]  Taco Tangler didn't get enough credit. All right we gotta hurry. No they're still here.
[1341.46s -> 1351.90s]  All right let's go. I'm going this way. I'm gonna bang a right. The little boxes that don't cost
[1351.90s -> 1357.69s]  anything have money in them. Yeah so it's a race against the difficulty. You gotta get a couple
[1357.69s -> 1370.46s]  items, couple levels. So are crits random? I think there's something that can influence it.
[1370.46s -> 1387.80s]  34 bucks? Shit I don't have enough. 55. All right 34. Let's go. I went to a dead end. Okay that is
[1388.60s -> 1399.43s]  extra. I got an extra jump. Okay that's pretty useful. Small natural crit chance. 23 bucks.
[1399.43s -> 1403.75s]  Don't got enough. What is that? I almost just jumped off the ledge. I'm so glad you did.
[1406.12s -> 1411.16s]  Okay teleport is by me. Chat's a natural hazard. Okay there's a lot of items over here too. Okay
[1411.16s -> 1418.04s]  teleporter right next to me. Okay I haven't even got one box yet. Offer to shrine of chance. 23
[1418.04s -> 1425.43s]  dollars. Okay you offer to shrine but gain nothing. Thanks. Middle click is a ping. Oh shit. Okay
[1425.43s -> 1430.10s]  well that's not what the teleporter is but that's a ping that you can see. You gain nothing. Wow.
[1430.10s -> 1437.43s]  Twice in a row. Shrine of chance. Las Vegas baby. Dude RNG in this game is a little like wonky.
[1448.55s -> 1451.35s]  Oh my god. Oh my god. Why the fuck am I getting swarmed in here?
[1452.44s -> 1466.92s]  Holy shit. Remember when I said five boxes? I'll settle for one. Jesus there's like there's a few
[1466.92s -> 1474.02s]  boxes over by me. I almost got enough money to do it. Somebody's like a sniper rifle over here.
[1474.02s -> 1487.37s]  Let's go back to this robot. All right I got a lot of money now. Let's go. They have to make these
[1487.37s -> 1492.79s]  boxes 69 dollars on purpose. Like that's not that's just part of the development cycle. All right I'm
[1492.79s -> 1497.74s]  gonna have like three or four boxes by the time this is done here. So this is uh dealing damage
[1497.74s -> 1506.82s]  heals you. That's pretty amazing. Okay oh god. How much does it heal? Can't really tell. Kind of heading
[1506.82s -> 1518.58s]  towards you. I've only got one box so far. I got two. Did you actually just hit me out of the air?
[1518.58s -> 1522.74s]  Oh this is this leech is incredible. Like I'm every time I get hit it just heals back up.
[1523.30s -> 1532.50s]  How much money you got? Uh 50 bucks. What's the uh purple dollar sign for? I'm not sure.
[1532.50s -> 1547.86s]  Gain temporary flight. Set okay missile launcher swarm of missiles. All right I've got three items
[1547.86s -> 1556.70s]  now. Four items. Sticky bomb. Chance on hit. All right I got I have five I got five items.
[1558.60s -> 1562.68s]  I got like the war banner thing. All right I now have two items.
[1567.02s -> 1583.08s]  Deal extra damage to bosses. I like that one. Okay I you know you almost ready to go here?
[1587.08s -> 1597.37s]  69. What is this one? I got it. What the fuck? I can jump three times. Okay everything stacks.
[1597.37s -> 1604.41s]  Assuming we win you get to keep that for the next. That's amazing. The next life and you just keep
[1604.41s -> 1610.90s]  getting more powerful. Is there like a soft way to land? Although I guess I have temporary flight so
[1610.90s -> 1614.98s]  I'll just activate that on the way down right? Probably yeah. Okay I'm just gonna get another
[1614.98s -> 1623.13s]  item. Here we go. What does this thing do? Well that was sick. Teleport. People are screaming
[1623.13s -> 1630.10s]  as to do teleporter. They're saying we're gonna run out of our opportunity here. Okay um are there
[1630.10s -> 1635.43s]  any more leftover boxes down here? Uh I don't there's one over here I think. And get did you
[1635.43s -> 1643.00s]  activate it? The teleporter? No. Oh god. Because I still have 70 dollars. I just need I can't spend
[1643.00s -> 1648.76s]  my money. All right well you can save it. All right let's go. Yes you can yeah. Turn on the shrine.
[1649.32s -> 1659.00s]  What's that? Oh boy. Monster tooth. Drop a healing orb on kill. You can do it again. What did that
[1659.00s -> 1669.03s]  just do? What are we gonna activate it? Yeah let's go. Oh god I'm not ready. Just kill this
[1669.03s -> 1680.41s]  last robot and then spawn him. And we're gonna do it man. We gotta go. Oh is that the boss up
[1680.41s -> 1691.94s]  there? Yeah it is. Yeah those are the bosses all right. I'm gonna get some distance. Whichever
[1691.94s -> 1710.54s]  that's like a big explosion I think. Oh my god there's so many. We gotta focus on one of them.
[1710.54s -> 1713.58s]  Focus on the one with the less health. I know I was just running away. We're like running into the
[1713.58s -> 1721.85s]  corner. We're so dead. We're gonna die again. You understand that right? Hold on. We're like
[1721.85s -> 1734.57s]  fundamentally doing something wrong. One of them is dead. One of them's dead. Good. So am I. Oh
[1734.57s -> 1747.45s]  you're dead. We are fundamentally doing something incorrect. Because he's not even at 50% health.
[1756.60s -> 1771.10s]  Get all items first. Well doesn't that make the boss harder? How far can I run? Wait I can share
[1771.10s -> 1782.98s]  items with you? How? How far away can I go? Okay not doing anything wrong. It's just a really hard
[1782.98s -> 1805.42s]  game. Okay I see. I'm gonna fall off the ledge. This game sucks. This character. All right taco.
[1805.42s -> 1813.18s]  No no no no no. Somebody said this character sucks early and is more geared towards late game.
[1813.18s -> 1823.24s]  But it's the first character though. That's not what I was trying to say. Stop sniping me. This
[1823.24s -> 1849.94s]  game sucks. That's not what I was trying to say. Turn the game up a little. Unlucky boss.
[1850.74s -> 1854.66s]  Unfortunate. Wait is this boss just like ridiculous? Just like a weird hard
[1855.54s -> 1863.86s]  RNG role of a boss? Why is the teleporter only at 57%? Yeah people are saying that this is this
[1863.86s -> 1867.94s]  boss. We kind of got like a bad role for like early new players because he's just like annoying
[1867.94s -> 1876.60s]  and hard to deal with. You might still do it. Oh god look at that like caravan of people behind
[1876.60s -> 1882.36s]  them. Yes I see all of them. There's so many. Oh they're behind me now too. And by the way we
[1882.36s -> 1889.77s]  have to stay inside the bubble around the teleporter to charge it. Oh god. We need to stay in the
[1889.77s -> 1901.03s]  teleporter sphere. So do you have to kill the boss? Yeah I think so. What is this ice demon?
[1901.67s -> 1921.59s]  No you almost got it. At 99% charge monsters stop spawning. Oh that's a huge deal. That is a huge
[1921.59s -> 1934.47s]  deal. That's good to know. Wait is that not true? Is somebody just lying? Somebody just lying? Okay
[1934.47s -> 1945.61s]  I'm definitely dead here. Says a lie? No it's true. It is true. Okay monsters will stop spawning at
[1945.61s -> 1972.30s]  99%. You're on medium difficulty now. Help me. This game's crazy. I'm dead. I was so close.
[1973.34s -> 1976.94s]  So people are asking why we're not playing the star. Because we're dying on the first
[1976.94s -> 1980.38s]  level. And we're dying on level one. And he has like a hundred hours in the game.
[1981.02s -> 1984.78s]  So you think you think he's gonna want to play with two chumps that are starting out in like
[1984.78s -> 1994.92s]  the noob level? We're dying on level one. He's like he has like 150 hours in the game right now.
[1996.12s -> 2008.73s]  Push continue. Maybe when we get a little better maybe he can jump in. Let us get through like the
[2008.73s -> 2028.42s]  first level first. I guess this is we got it this time. This time charge inside. So we're on like
[2028.42s -> 2037.21s]  the regular difficulty. Learn on drizzle. Drizzle is too easy. Play drizzle until you get used to
[2037.21s -> 2043.13s]  the game. Says weeping and gnashing is replaced by laughter and tickles.
[2049.02s -> 2055.02s]  Drizzle is baby mode. I don't think you're allowed to stream on that mode. I think if you stream on
[2055.02s -> 2060.12s]  that mode people laugh at you. Yeah I think something goes bad. But it's okay because okay
[2060.12s -> 2064.04s]  let's do like a few more attempts on rainstorm and if I'm all right with doing the drizzle mode.
[2067.35s -> 2070.55s]  I think we can do it. I think we were pretty close. We just have to lock it in.
[2071.75s -> 2081.11s]  Yeah let's lock it in. Let's go. We'll be laughing at you no matter what.
[2082.44s -> 2089.08s]  I think we're starting to understand the basic elements of the game. Starting to figure it out.
[2089.08s -> 2101.58s]  Yeah I felt like I actually did a lot better last time. Yeah charge the pod. That whole
[2101.58s -> 2117.05s]  enemies not spawning after 99% is actually a big deal. This way try to get some money. I got 34.
[2117.77s -> 2127.13s]  Why would we spawn up here? RNG man. We won't laugh at you guys for playing drizzle. We'll laugh at
[2127.13s -> 2134.89s]  you when you die at the first level on drizzle. That's fair. Okay that's actually fair. Yeah
[2134.89s -> 2140.79s]  no that's the decent terms. I could agree to those terms. I'm afraid to agree to those terms though
[2140.79s -> 2145.59s]  because I feel like when you agree to those terms if something goes wrong and you lose you have all
[2145.59s -> 2150.47s]  your credibility is gone forever. But then you have to just play again but on the hardest difficulty
[2150.47s -> 2158.90s]  and then win. That's the only way you could get your credit back I think. There's nothing over here.
[2158.90s -> 2165.56s]  Your gamer licenses have been revoked. Take it like this. If Sekiro had a drizzle mode would
[2165.56s -> 2171.64s]  you play on it? No. Uh-oh not this conversation. We already talked about this last night. Oh we
[2171.64s -> 2179.16s]  already wrapped around. Where hang on where's where are we supposed to go? Uh I came down
[2179.96s -> 2187.45s]  okay well we got we both have money. Have you gone down here already? Yeah but not all the way down
[2188.01s -> 2203.35s]  but I just got exploded on. Sekiro with guns baby. Lost on the first level. Come on give us a break.
[2203.35s -> 2207.35s]  We're trying we're trying to figure it out. This is we're brand new risk of rain 2 players.
[2208.07s -> 2214.39s]  Yeah don't push us away risk of rain 1 veterans okay. You want people to play your like fun
[2214.39s -> 2220.71s]  franchise? This is this is how you do it. I got the bandolier chance on kill drop an ammo pack
[2220.71s -> 2227.64s]  that resets cooldowns. That's pretty awesome. What's this one? Your offer to the shrine is
[2227.64s -> 2235.05s]  rewarded. I get a hundred percent crits for eight seconds. That's actually great. What is that?
[2235.05s -> 2238.49s]  I found the teleport. I got a friend. I have like a turret friend. We have like a new party member.
[2239.13s -> 2247.78s]  Oh it's it's star. Star just joined the game. He's like a turret. He's a mini sentry. Does he move?
[2248.50s -> 2254.89s]  I don't think so. There's a turret yeah that turret's pretty awesome though. We could like
[2254.89s -> 2261.51s]  lead because the teleporter's right here so he's gonna help. Yeah we'll just lead every enemy to
[2261.51s -> 2266.54s]  that thing. All right we got to keep moving. Is that a health bar? That thing is amazing.
[2267.85s -> 2273.64s]  It can it die? I assume it can get exploded. It has a health bar. What's this one? This one's smoking
[2273.64s -> 2280.76s]  60 something. Is this the same level we were just on but everything's different or is the
[2280.76s -> 2288.28s]  level actually randomly generated? Spawned on here. Taco my turret. I need help taco.
[2290.41s -> 2296.17s]  Yes yes yes doesn't help. I asked two questions. I got a healing drone. I have a lot of like robots
[2296.17s -> 2301.85s]  with me. All right come down here. I feel like this is the spot to be. Oh no I have to choose
[2301.85s -> 2314.44s]  which one I want. Yes no. It's slightly different okay. All right what about how much money do I
[2314.44s -> 2322.46s]  have? 55? What do I need? 60 to open this? Drones are a huge deal. The generic layout is the same
[2322.46s -> 2326.76s]  with some doors and bridges that have changed. Okay what is the launch? Each level has two to
[2326.76s -> 2334.46s]  three variations mostly static items are random and I assume also the layout. Oh my god do you
[2334.46s -> 2339.98s]  kid me? Got two turrets. All right I got so much money I don't know what to do with it. I guess
[2339.98s -> 2342.22s]  I'll spend it at this shrine. I think we're gonna win. I think we're gonna win this level just
[2342.22s -> 2358.73s]  because of the turrets. Crowbar. Dude these guys are gonna be the first level. Are you kidding me?
[2360.98s -> 2369.62s]  I was here. World first. All right give me this thing. So you have a heal drone too? Yeah. You
[2369.62s -> 2373.14s]  have two like drones on the ground and a heal drone. That's pretty sick. That's got a guitar.
[2373.14s -> 2381.54s]  And his music. What is this door? It's electric. What? Nothing. What does a ukulele do? Are we
[2381.54s -> 2389.19s]  ready to pop it? Pop it. We gotta stay in here though. I don't see any more chests but I have
[2389.19s -> 2392.55s]  like two hundred dollars. That's the best item. I don't know what it does. What does it do?
[2394.33s -> 2402.09s]  Taco. Taco Tuesday. What does it do? Probably like plays music. All right you ready? I'm going. Here
[2402.09s -> 2413.37s]  we go. All right we got just gotta stay inside the red. Where are they? Oh it's that guy. It's a big.
[2414.25s -> 2426.09s]  Where is it? It's the big guy. He's a big jellyfish. All right get in the red. He shoots
[2426.09s -> 2430.17s]  like a slow moving zappy orb. Oh my god. And then a then a bunch of fast ones.
[2432.92s -> 2441.11s]  Going for max crits. I think you can stop those. Just just be careful when they get to the
[2441.11s -> 2446.78s]  destination. All right I did a ton of damage. Eight seconds of crits was pretty sick. That was
[2446.78s -> 2455.32s]  awesome. We're doing it. Watch out for that orb. I don't know what this is. Just run. What does that
[2455.32s -> 2463.32s]  mean? I don't know. I don't know but it did a lot of damage. E3 pretend gameplay. Watch out man.
[2467.53s -> 2471.56s]  Nice work. He's dead. They did it. They beat the first level. Now we just have to charge the
[2471.56s -> 2480.42s]  teleporter. That was way easier than the other guy. He really was. What's this? Chance to fire
[2480.42s -> 2484.90s]  a missile. Chance to fire a missile. He oh he drops a bunch of shit and I just took it all.
[2484.90s -> 2494.33s]  I'm a greedy fuck. Oh I see how it is. The drone guy. I thought I just I saw items and I pick them
[2494.33s -> 2502.25s]  up. Someone took both boss items. Yeah I did. I'm gonna be the cannon. I didn't know what it
[2502.25s -> 2506.57s]  did. That was how the game. I just saw an item on the ground. I have a shriveled mat. I'm not
[2506.57s -> 2512.31s]  showing you an item. This game's old school. You have to like get to really test your friendships
[2512.31s -> 2518.63s]  okay. Everyone's saying shame on you. Not personal loot. Yeah okay guys. This isn't Diablo 3. This is
[2518.63s -> 2525.83s]  called fucking snooze you'll lose. All right are we ready? How do you kick someone from a lobby?
[2527.59s -> 2539.26s]  Taco how do you kick someone from a lobby? Open oh open all the boxes. Oh I think after the
[2539.26s -> 2547.48s]  boss dies we can go around and pick up all the we're on medium difficulty now. We are on medium
[2547.48s -> 2555.14s]  now yes permanently I guess. Okay well it's because we're not going fast enough. They should
[2555.14s -> 2561.27s]  have just risk of rain like rain's not that fast. I feel like it should have been called risk of rain
[2561.27s -> 2568.22s]  you know to indicate the speed. Oh never mind. What's hitting me? Oh all your money gets converted
[2568.22s -> 2572.94s]  to experience after you get into okay all your money gets turned into experience when you go
[2572.94s -> 2578.78s]  into teleporter so you gotta spend it. Don't hoard your cash spend it or maybe if you need
[2578.78s -> 2582.62s]  to level up. Oh so all my money's gone from all your money every cent you have is gone it's
[2582.62s -> 2590.76s]  experience now. Wait it turns into xp? Turns into experience. Turns into experience? It turns into
[2590.76s -> 2604.15s]  experience. Why is the ammo on the ground even doing? All right 82 let's go. Why is he jumping
[2604.15s -> 2613.18s]  so much? 3d glasses chance to critically strike. Oh it wasn't charged. What the hell was this thing?
[2615.59s -> 2621.51s]  Heal all nearby allies after standing still for two seconds. Turn around. I'm a healer now.
[2622.07s -> 2640.46s]  What is this thing? 72 I don't have enough. Come at me. This is gonna be easy. What's this thing?
[2640.46s -> 2645.58s]  Oh a little lance. Change to bleed. So everything's way more expensive now but are enemies worth more
[2645.58s -> 2658.09s]  money? Uh looks like it yeah. I assume so. Pick one. Yeah I picked it. Oh how you doing? You get
[2658.09s -> 2665.43s]  nothing. How am I doing? Yeah. Pretty good. Um I've got a crowbar times two. It also can heal you
[2665.43s -> 2674.49s]  apparently. Lunar. What is lunar? I think it's like a special type of currency. Okay so it's like a
[2674.49s -> 2688.70s]  special kind of currency thing? Is that what you're just saying? Okay I see this game is serious.
[2689.42s -> 2697.27s]  That's why that's what I've heard. That's fine. I plan on taking it seriously. There's an uh box
[2697.27s -> 2703.34s]  up here. I see where you are. What's that? Look at that. What's down there? Uh what are you talking
[2703.34s -> 2712.47s]  about? There's a ton of boxes down the swamp. I have no idea. Are we just throwing boxes at me?
[2712.47s -> 2726.97s]  What the hell? Oh no it's you. I want my lucky item. I get it. That's cool. Lunars stick between
[2726.97s -> 2737.08s]  um runs and are quite useful. Um I'm trying to mark stuff with middle mouse. If you see something.
[2737.08s -> 2746.50s]  Oh that's cool. Yeah the only reason why somebody told me that is because I looked over and I saw
[2746.50s -> 2759.35s]  oh my god Jeremy like 30 times. Personal shield. Did you get this? Use 30. So 3D printer. I marked you.
[2760.07s -> 2764.01s]  So does the 3D printer can I just put something in there? How do I choose what item goes in or
[2764.01s -> 2772.58s]  does it just show up there? Whatever it is. I have no idea. I just checked. All right I got a lot of
[2772.58s -> 2777.91s]  bleed power now. Have we found the teleporter? Well I don't think we have. There's a lot of boxes though.
[2778.87s -> 2789.34s]  I have no idea where it is. We probably should think about doing it though because we're about
[2789.34s -> 2794.97s]  to move into hard. Yeah it's probably not a good idea. We're gonna move into hard difficult. Is it
[2794.97s -> 2800.41s]  just it's just hidden somewhere. I don't know where you've been. I guess I do because all these
[2800.41s -> 2806.82s]  boxes are open. It chooses an item that's the same color to exchange it. The teleporter has orange
[2806.82s -> 2815.78s]  particles. Little heal but if you have 116 boxes a heal bot right here. I got it. Get two heal bots.
[2818.02s -> 2820.74s]  All right let's we gotta find this teleporter. We're both gonna move into hard and then we're
[2820.74s -> 2829.08s]  gonna get laughed at. What's this? I need one of these. The orange one I think is active items it
[2829.08s -> 2835.88s]  is. Yeah it seems like it. Um look for orange particles floating up. I need like nine dollars
[2837.26s -> 2849.29s]  taco lend me not money. I teleport where the fuck is it? Over here I see little particles.
[2850.01s -> 2854.86s]  There's a little like orange particles here. I got it. It's right here on me.
[2855.50s -> 2862.49s]  I'm going full boss killer mode. All right um should we do it? I guess we just punch it. I don't
[2862.49s -> 2866.41s]  know I guess. Punch it let's go. Before it gets too hard. Before it gets too late. All right let's focus
[2866.41s -> 2870.73s]  the boss. We're in a bit of a corner back against the wall. It's jellyfish too. We got this.
[2872.41s -> 2878.54s]  Jellyfish sucks. We can kill this thing. It's too bad we have to look through the water to do it.
[2883.67s -> 2889.43s]  Get rid of these guys first. They're kind of just causing a problem. Yeah I do so much boss damage.
[2889.43s -> 2902.73s]  Here's full crits. Got it. He's dead. All right easy. Now wait wait wait wait there's like boss
[2902.73s -> 2905.85s]  items here. I'm not gonna Diablo to you. I'm not gonna like kill bail. All right well you got the
[2905.85s -> 2910.65s]  last two. I get these two. All right you. Oh but but but what about me? They're both mine. All right
[2910.65s -> 2914.49s]  come on. I accidentally bailed you. You got the first two. That accident doesn't matter. We're even.
[2914.49s -> 2918.49s]  We're square now. They're two bandoliers. I was the asshole that killed bail and everybody's
[2918.49s -> 2925.51s]  computer freezes but that person somehow got to click first. Eye for an eye. Justice has been
[2925.51s -> 2932.54s]  served. I have a chance on drop the reset cooldowns. It was always such bullshit because it was the
[2932.54s -> 2937.18s]  audio loading his death animation and what would happen is you'd get some sorcerers that would come
[2937.18s -> 2943.74s]  in and just melt the fuck out of him before he did his first line. My brother zoo will not die
[2943.74s -> 2949.74s]  and it would load his second audio clip and crash everybody's computer and that one sorcerer's got
[2949.74s -> 2960.23s]  to take everything. It was bullshit. They kill him before he got his fucking second line. All right
[2960.23s -> 2965.43s]  do we have any more boxes or are we ready? Um there's probably boxes but we're in hard now.
[2965.91s -> 2971.67s]  We are in hard yeah. The cusp of hard mode. You only knew this because you were the sorcerer. No
[2971.67s -> 2980.18s]  I know this because I was the victim of a sorcerer. Why are they locked with like tendrils? It's money
[2980.18s -> 2985.46s]  money money. Spend the money quick. Yeah but the the boxes were locked. They had like orange tendrils
[2985.46s -> 2991.00s]  around them. All right we're going I'm going to teleport. What do you mean you're going to
[2991.00s -> 2995.56s]  teleport? What about the boxes? I'm entering the teleporter. Oh shit. Oh my money's all gone.
[2996.36s -> 3007.38s]  I ran past three boxes. They're all locked. You can't loot because the teleporter's charging.
[3008.58s -> 3013.06s]  Well everybody we were saying let's go get the boxes and we were both left the teleporter.
[3013.06s -> 3020.07s]  Before you say anything man hold on I mean snow level pog. We're already halfway through hard.
[3024.97s -> 3029.53s]  All right get that wasn't my decision. I didn't make that decision. He did.
[3030.25s -> 3037.59s]  Whatever here comes the angry chat. Bring it on. I deal I deal with cross-eyed angry
[3037.59s -> 3042.86s]  little people like you every day chat. You understand? Well tell me how you really feel.
[3046.68s -> 3055.22s]  Give me your rage emojis. Okay they feed me. Dude pay attention to the game. Next to you I know
[3055.22s -> 3062.38s]  you'll be talking about like lemon basil lemonade. God like focus. This is gonna hurt me. That's I
[3062.38s -> 3069.67s]  don't like that. Return this game. I'm gonna refund it. It's been two hours. This thing has so much
[3069.67s -> 3077.80s]  health. Look the only boxes we missed were active item boxes. Everything else has been looted
[3078.52s -> 3082.33s]  because we're just too good at this game now. All right I can pick an item. I can pick either like
[3082.33s -> 3098.33s]  baby lunchbox or bullets. Which one? I'm gonna do baby. Chance to block incoming damage. This
[3098.33s -> 3108.94s]  thing's fucking crazy. These guys have a lot of health. Yeah they do. Oh he hits you from the top
[3108.94s -> 3117.21s]  too. It's like balls and shit. We're yeah because we're on hard. We're about to be in very hard.
[3117.21s -> 3123.29s]  Yeah we're just about to lose basically. Faster. All right okay fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.
[3123.29s -> 3128.98s]  Find the uh find the teleporter. We're about to get destroyed. It's also like ice enemies that
[3128.98s -> 3138.14s]  slow you down and freeze you. I have so much money though hold on. Is there a box on the way?
[3138.14s -> 3146.73s]  All right the particles are this way. Yep there's a teleporter right there. Taking damage all right.
[3147.61s -> 3158.52s]  Um I don't know I mean it's wearing very hard. We gotta do it now. What's the hardest difficulty?
[3159.48s -> 3164.44s]  What is it? Does it cap or does it just keep going to like very very very very very hard?
[3164.44s -> 3169.77s]  I don't know. I think we could afford to get like one or two more boxes. I have like 500 bucks.
[3169.77s -> 3181.24s]  It's a wood banner. What the fuck are you guys doing? Why is everybody laughing so hard? What are
[3181.24s -> 3193.46s]  you doing? Everybody is laughing. Why? Um what is going on? They're just laughing preemptively
[3193.46s -> 3198.02s]  because they expect us to die. Oh that's the name. The hardest difficulty is in all capitals.
[3198.02s -> 3204.52s]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh I see. But apparently there's like 20 difficulties.
[3205.75s -> 3210.79s]  This is so cool. Yeah now that we haven't like kept dying the third time in a row
[3212.10s -> 3216.04s]  we're actually playing the game. I'm gonna hit every single one of those auto attacks.
[3217.26s -> 3221.50s]  Yes I just called it an auto attack and I'm sorry. Somebody's gonna be like what is this?
[3221.50s -> 3225.10s]  And then I gotta get my last hits in. All right I'm gonna I'm turning it on.
[3226.28s -> 3229.72s]  What? Should I turn this on or should we get more stuff? The teleporter?
[3230.76s -> 3235.32s]  Yeah. I'm pretty far away. Well just try to get a couple more boxes. We gotta
[3235.32s -> 3243.42s]  we're in very hard now. They're being very greedy with the boxes this time.
[3243.98s -> 3258.47s]  When do we unlock a new character? All right go ahead and turn on new stuff. Do we just buy it?
[3258.47s -> 3270.63s]  Well at this point I would call this an item run because I don't see any more boxes around.
[3270.63s -> 3280.52s]  There's like a money box. I almost just died to a default enemy. If you if we can complete this
[3280.52s -> 3291.56s]  teleporter here we will unlock a new character. This is two thousand six hundred and sixty six
[3291.56s -> 3297.74s]  dollars. It's gigantic. Do you have that kind of money? No I got nine hundred. Can we pool our
[3297.74s -> 3304.98s]  money together somehow and buy this mega thing? Look at this drone man. That's two charges of
[3304.98s -> 3321.05s]  your utility skill. That sounds kind of good. How much is this game? Nineteen dollars. That's
[3321.05s -> 3325.69s]  pretty good. Twenty bucks. Nineteen ninety nine. Twenty dollars. This is also only the first
[3325.69s -> 3329.29s]  character. There's like six total characters in the early access right now. All right we gotta
[3329.29s -> 3334.02s]  go turn the teleporter on. There's no more boxes here. Holy shit I can do that twice. All right
[3334.02s -> 3337.54s]  let's go let's go fight. Unless you want to grind another like thousand dollars and get the super
[3337.54s -> 3344.87s]  drone. I apparently I get this is cool. All right let's go. Let's we gotta turn it on otherwise
[3344.87s -> 3362.44s]  it's gonna get too super hard. It's on consoles at all or just PC. I don't know. I have a triple roll.
[3362.52s -> 3370.58s]  Wow. All right let's do it. Oh boy. Yep. I just rolled off the edge. No I didn't. Thank god.
[3373.16s -> 3381.11s]  Uh we got like a lava worm on the ice level. Is that the boss? I don't know but I'm trying
[3381.11s -> 3384.55s]  to like clear. We all right I don't know. Yeah it's the worm is like flying around.
[3387.66s -> 3398.89s]  God there's so many fucking enemies here. Oh dear. He's just flying around. Oh my I'm gonna die.
[3401.11s -> 3407.19s]  Oh there's too many enemies. Are you all right? I'm gonna bring my drone over to you.
[3408.25s -> 3414.12s]  My drone just found me finally. This week is gonna last.
[3414.92s -> 3432.04s]  Whoa. This is not a race. Oh you're right on top of me. Oh god. Uh what are we at?
[3432.68s -> 3444.06s]  59 percent. Ow. My drone can't heal fast enough. There's too many people. Uh there's so many.
[3445.80s -> 3478.46s]  74. Uh so many heads. 89. No. 94. I got it. All right we got it. We got it. All right he's
[3478.46s -> 3486.97s]  doing like a third. Enemies no longer spawn. All right so focus on the adds then. Yeah. Oh my god.
[3490.44s -> 3499.86s]  I'm dead. Are you? Oh yeah. I died inside this. You can do it. I will try. There is nowhere for me
[3499.86s -> 3517.48s]  to go. All right I think we're good. Almost. Do you choose who's rockets or is it just a random
[3517.48s -> 3542.44s]  chance? I think it's random. Wee. All right you got this. Uh this is fucking crazy. I missed every
[3542.44s -> 3546.92s]  shot. Stupid idiot. Sorry. Because you can't look straight up. I know it's true. I just figured that
[3546.92s -> 3557.93s]  out right now. Oh my god. Wow three rolls. Yeah. I am very jealous of that. That's like huge
[3557.93s -> 3568.57s]  survivability. I know it's great. There we go. See you later. We did it. How do I revive you? Oh
[3568.57s -> 3575.26s]  two guitars. You get both the guitars and then I come back. You get both of them yeah. His music
[3575.26s -> 3585.62s]  was electric. Wow all right so should I just pick up stuff or should we just go? Um up to you I guess.
[3585.62s -> 3588.10s]  Uh let me just see. There's something in the vicinity. There's something right here. Let me
[3588.10s -> 3597.69s]  just get this and we'll go. There's a couple things here. Let me just pick it up. That's a
[3597.77s -> 3605.13s]  heel thing. What's this? I haven't really noticed the uh med kit working. Yeah it's weird. Sprint
[3605.13s -> 3613.37s]  faster. Can I buy more than one? No. All right there's a couple blocks this way. I wish we
[3613.37s -> 3618.90s]  would have found this cave before we uh. Yeah seriously. Because I think we both went in with
[3618.90s -> 3625.26s]  like a thousand bucks. Yeah all right after I get to the top here I'm just gonna drop down.
[3626.52s -> 3631.56s]  Yes guys I know I won't get the third. The character unlock. Too bad I'm never gonna play.
[3631.56s -> 3635.32s]  Yeah apparently you only get it if you kill that enemy but it's too bad I'm never gonna play this
[3635.32s -> 3640.04s]  game again so I'll never get another chance to unlock it. You don't you don't unlock that even
[3640.04s -> 3644.62s]  if you're in like the party. All right I'm just gonna. Apparently yeah I guess I'm just uninstalling
[3644.62s -> 3653.51s]  when we die. But what an uninstallable what an uninstallatable game you know what I mean?
[3653.51s -> 3661.70s]  Did you know if you die after the third level both of us the game uninstalls itself. That's what
[3661.70s -> 3666.65s]  people in chat are saying. It's so like. And you never get to play it again. It's so relatable to
[3666.65s -> 3675.91s]  uninstall it. It's an uns. I don't even know what the word I just said was. Well let's just go. This
[3675.91s -> 3691.50s]  is like our first real run might as well just go uninstallable. There it is. All right so um for my
[3691.50s -> 3698.15s]  chat I want you to notice the different look press tab and just look at the itemization there.
[3698.15s -> 3706.81s]  Yeah what about it. Look how many more. Well I still. You've got than me. Yeah well it's called
[3707.69s -> 3713.61s]  I've been I've been buying only two of those items that were illegal items that I got for free. You
[3713.61s -> 3719.37s]  also got two items. I wasn't making any accusations. I was just merely pointing out. I feel there's a
[3719.37s -> 3725.05s]  dramatic difference there. You got two free boss items. Remember I. Yeah I'm not complaining. I'm
[3725.05s -> 3731.29s]  just saying I think it's funny. That's it. Oh yeah I just think it's funny. Yeah I'm just like
[3731.29s -> 3734.97s]  want to point out. I think it's like kind of. Listen what would my complaint be. I'm not saying
[3734.97s -> 3742.94s]  you're like sniping items. I'm saying that you've just got a lot more. I'm just kidding. But I mean
[3744.06s -> 3749.62s]  if I had to point any fingers I'm just kidding. See now it comes out. Well guys all this takes
[3749.62s -> 3760.62s]  is time. All it takes is like a few minutes of prodding and you'll get it out. Whoa these jump
[3760.62s -> 3766.87s]  pads go. This is a very vertical level here. How do you dodge that shit. Just to run away. He's
[3766.87s -> 3775.10s]  gonna do it again. This level looks crazy. Yeah when he does the big laser beam dude you have to
[3775.10s -> 3787.56s]  just line aside something. Oh yeah. I'm gonna die to a normal boss. Something behind me.
[3787.56s -> 3797.16s]  Yeah this is just like a random like elite enemy huh. We're on impossible difficulty now by the
[3797.16s -> 3807.77s]  way. Yeah we are. That's why it takes so long to kill one person. All right do I have enough money
[3807.77s -> 3820.39s]  to buy shit. A mask. I can summon a ghost if I kill something. It's like some Luigi's Mansion music.
[3823.50s -> 3834.68s]  I like it. Another huge guy. Oh that's one of my ghosts. Okay I get it. Where's the big dude.
[3836.62s -> 3857.21s]  Down here. Whoa. Watch out for that shit. I need this. My god they're everywhere. Yeah I'm pretty
[3857.21s -> 3865.48s]  much just gonna die to regular like elites at that moment. Very very high health. I'll be happy if
[3865.48s -> 3874.28s]  we can take this guy down. Uh oh I just prayed to the shrine of combat. It was a huge mistake.
[3874.92s -> 3880.12s]  Chance to stun on hit. Come to me quickly. Oh you. Oh my god. Yes right now. I'm coming I'm coming
[3880.12s -> 3886.78s]  I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming. What do you need. I just need you to shoot everyone behind me.
[3886.78s -> 3897.59s]  Okay. Oh god. We have like two mini bosses here. Should I not have done that. I just pressed it.
[3897.59s -> 3904.95s]  Oh no. Oculus HD HUD. Oh wait did I just press it. Okay I you know. Okay I get it. I go. Oh my god
[3904.95s -> 3918.09s]  we're dead. Well it was fun. It was fun. That was good. Well yeah hold on. I was out of my element
[3918.09s -> 3927.50s]  there. I'm not dead yet. Yet. Minus a hundred and three health is what I ended with. Oh god I'm dead.
[3927.50s -> 3933.59s]  Yeah well that was a good one. So today I learned praying to the shrine of combat is a challenge
[3936.78s -> 3942.14s]  and if you pray to it you must be prepared for the elite summons. All right so we unlock stuff.
[3943.86s -> 3950.63s]  Monster lock. Beetle. This item will now randomly appear in the runs. Advancement. This item. So we
[3950.63s -> 3961.29s]  unlocked a few more items. Elder Lemurians. Cool. Cool. All right so to be honest the commando kind
[3961.29s -> 3967.32s]  of sucks. Well he is the starter character so. This is cool. That's that's what I've got. Now
[3967.32s -> 3974.07s]  there's the huntress behind me. Yeah so there's a stray fire seeking arrow for 150 damage can be
[3974.07s -> 3983.11s]  used while sprinting. Laser glaive. Glaive that bounces six times. Damage increased by 10 percent
[3983.11s -> 3999.83s]  per bounce. Instead of a dodge it's a blink. And then arrow rain. Cool. All right I got I mean
[4000.39s -> 4012.81s]  I got I'll try it. It's Freudian's birthday today. Happy birthday happy birthday Freudian.
[4013.37s -> 4027.77s]  So this is like a bow and arrow. I'm so ready for this. You've got different powers now. Yeah.
[4028.41s -> 4033.77s]  You got unique abilities. What's your uh basic attack obviously at the bow but I wonder
[4033.77s -> 4038.49s]  I think everyone's basic attack is different. Let's find out and maybe it's not a burst fire
[4038.49s -> 4054.42s]  maybe it's just one shot. It is. Is this like EDF? Yes. Um what it's a homing shot. It it really
[4054.42s -> 4058.34s]  is just you get aimbot. You just do you have aimbot now. You just have to put the cursor
[4058.34s -> 4064.57s]  somewhere near them and then press the button. That's pretty awesome. Uh yeah I give me. Is it
[4064.57s -> 4070.33s]  like weaker shots to compensate I guess probably. Well you shoot it's less. It's like one two three
[4070.33s -> 4080.66s]  instead of like no me. All right we understand what's going on here. Let's get it going.
[4081.22s -> 4093.43s]  It's like the glaive right? Cool. Now what does this do? Whoa rain of arrows. That looks sweet.
[4093.43s -> 4103.72s]  That's the dodge. That goes a long way. All right let's open up some boxes. Well here's the um
[4103.72s -> 4117.56s]  teleporter. What do I get? Rubik's cube. I feel like I'm getting the same power-ups. Uh the range
[4117.56s -> 4122.52s]  though. Here's the thing about I cannot physically shoot a the weapon if somebody's not like in
[4122.52s -> 4129.38s]  range. Oh really? Yeah they have to be like within range to hit them. That was that box.
[4130.42s -> 4135.32s]  I already got that one. Where's the other one? I was standing right next to it. Oh no that's just a
[4135.32s -> 4157.06s]  jump. RNG baby. See I have the same loadout. All right um cool. All right boxes I need open. 55.
[4157.06s -> 4165.19s]  That is a gunner drone. Oh you can sprint while shooting too. That's cool. Oh that is pretty
[4165.19s -> 4168.47s]  handy. Where are these glasses? Which one of these do I want? Give me this one.
[4169.35s -> 4178.84s]  Healing orb on kill. All right what do you think? You can blink up too. Well that's kind of insane.
[4179.48s -> 4192.71s]  You ready to start this? Um I guess so. Let's get this party started. Hold on I'm running towards you
[4192.71s -> 4208.97s]  pretty far away. Coming back into the fray. It's a beetle queen. Need more money.
[4209.77s -> 4227.32s]  Wow that hurt. All right where's the boss? Oh there it is. Back here. So bugs are bad. Bugs are bad.
[4228.95s -> 4239.64s]  Oops how far does this go? It goes pretty far actually. How much damage does my little piercing
[4239.64s -> 4253.64s]  shot do? 44. Nice. That's pretty good. Can you believe we died on this level? Yeah well we didn't
[4253.64s -> 4260.07s]  know what the hell was going on. Yeah but like now it seems like a foreign concept. I don't
[4260.07s -> 4265.27s]  understand how because I feel like I'm not trying. I picked up one boss item. All right you get the
[4265.27s -> 4270.31s]  other one. But you also remember like we just installed the game. Yeah we did just install it.
[4271.11s -> 4277.80s]  It's an onion. Beetle guard. All right box time. We have plenty of time. We're still in easy. Is
[4277.80s -> 4283.16s]  this your friend? I don't is this your guy? I have like a beetle friend. What? Yeah it was one of the
[4283.64s -> 4289.69s]  boss items. All right can he die? He's doing like aoe like he's a third character.
[4291.61s -> 4302.41s]  All right 148 bucks. If you have the money. I keep shooting him thinking he's a bad guy.
[4303.29s -> 4312.09s]  Resets cooldowns. Yeah if you hold tab you can mouse over the items too. There's another. I've
[4312.09s -> 4317.05s]  got a healing drone now. Those are so useful. Healing drones are so good. What about one of
[4317.05s -> 4322.90s]  these like shrines? Reactivate it. Which one? There's one down here. I don't have enough money
[4322.90s -> 4333.32s]  to do that now. Yeah I do. I don't know where to go from what boxes. What is purple money? I don't
[4333.32s -> 4342.76s]  think we have purple money yet. All right I'm ready to teleport. Hold on. I still have 160 dollars.
[4342.76s -> 4351.48s]  Whenever you're ready. I don't want to 3D print this. That's an RNG shrine not an item shrine.
[4351.48s -> 4362.12s]  Cool. Good to know. Oh is it changing my items into med kits? Oh that's what that does. Oh I'm
[4362.12s -> 4367.64s]  changing my I'm changing my good items into the worst item in the game. I see. Uh oh. Yeah I like
[4367.64s -> 4374.87s]  the extra challenge. Ready to rock and roll. I had no idea of what that machine does. Gamble from stuff
[4374.87s -> 4386.42s]  at that shrine. All right time's ticking. You ready? Hold on. I'm gambling. Easy easy. I'm gambling.
[4386.98s -> 4397.43s]  I got an evil teddy. Dio's best friend. Tie the clock. We're gonna get to be 75 years old when
[4397.43s -> 4406.50s]  I get to hard. All right. Go go go go. It's about facing your fears and racing the time. I get to
[4406.58s -> 4426.70s]  come back to life once. I have a cheat def. Nice. Activate. Oh nice. Here we go. I can see why
[4426.70s -> 4431.30s]  people think this is really fun. This is just like. You can see why but you don't think so personally?
[4431.30s -> 4445.61s]  No. Yeah I agree. No. I'm joking. I think it's fun. Oh well I just kill stole you. Sorry. Sorry
[4445.61s -> 4452.57s]  Gab. What was his name? Gab. What was his name? Bring back smite. Yeah. No Jeb. That was what it
[4452.57s -> 4472.06s]  was. All right. Do I have money? I have money. Let's buy some stuff. So what was my other item
[4472.06s -> 4477.58s]  that I got besides the teddy? You can attack speed up. All right there's a lunar item here
[4477.58s -> 4481.93s]  on this part of the level. All right come on. I gotta hurry up. It's all about speed.
[4482.65s -> 4494.86s]  There's too many places to go. There's too many things to see. Okay there's another one of these.
[4494.86s -> 4514.33s]  Chance to bleed again. It's a gab bush. Jeb down. What's a safe way to get down without dying of
[4514.33s -> 4520.73s]  fall damage? I think you can dodge right before. Really? That's what somebody. I think I may have
[4520.73s -> 4525.85s]  just accidentally read that in chat and I think. No it's true. It is right? Yeah it works. I got
[4525.85s -> 4541.18s]  knowledge. Sometimes. Thanks taco. Enough money to buy this? Yes. What did you drop? Did he just drop
[4541.18s -> 4553.30s]  a box? Or is that just here? All right we're in medium now. That is the way I like my cheeseburgers.
[4557.21s -> 4562.89s]  This is not this was not wise what I just did. I just got two med kits. Look away chat. I thought
[4562.89s -> 4569.80s]  I could move. All right we gotta find teleported. I'm spending too much time here. Listen. I looked
[4569.80s -> 4574.60s]  over the chat and it was just like you guys are fucking idiots. Stupid fucking morons. Like hurry
[4574.60s -> 4585.88s]  the fuck up. Like it's all I see in the chat. It's kind of like crazy. Like they specifically
[4585.88s -> 4591.02s]  keep calling out you in particular. They keep going like italics. God damn it. And like they
[4591.02s -> 4597.32s]  capitalize the damn it. So it's like really like emphasized and rude. Good tell them to say it to
[4597.32s -> 4605.70s]  my face. Oh shit that's the wrong chat. Sorry. I was in your chat. Sorry. Oh that makes more sense.
[4608.76s -> 4616.74s]  Like I'm just in your chat. That's reasonable now. Not as far fetched as it once was.
[4617.22s -> 4631.61s]  Do you have you found the teleporter yet? No. Oh I'm trying either. Look for the orange sprinkled.
[4634.86s -> 4645.03s]  The orange sprinkled dust. Yeah there's a lot of items down here. What is this? What's this moon?
[4645.03s -> 4650.47s]  What's the moon thing mean? You see that too right? The moon? It's got a question mark.
[4652.07s -> 4664.20s]  Offer to shrine of blood lose 50% HP. No. You do that. What did it do? It didn't do anything.
[4668.15s -> 4672.07s]  It gives you money. If I do it it's 75%. Oh shit I got money. Okay it gives you money.
[4673.83s -> 4678.07s]  So like do you get your health back or is it permanently gone? No I have 279 HP.
[4678.87s -> 4687.18s]  So if I do it I'm not going to. Whatever I'll do it. Yeah you get 100 and you get gold. Turret
[4687.18s -> 4700.22s]  down here. Um 3d print this. I like that. What about this? He's helping it. All right I need to find
[4700.22s -> 4705.26s]  more boxes. Come over here I got something for you. Oh I got the rope. We're gonna have to get
[4705.26s -> 4715.11s]  over here. We can both have a rubik's cube. Okay. Right there. This? Yeah get it. It's inactive.
[4717.50s -> 4722.38s]  But I have eight seconds of crit so which one's better? Oh shit I don't know. Maybe I should take
[4722.38s -> 4727.43s]  them both. Yeah I don't think I can carry both. All right we gotta activate this. I gotta find a
[4727.43s -> 4739.64s]  fucking teleporter. Is crowbar good? Uh yeah I think so. Does it take a random item in the 3d
[4739.64s -> 4747.66s]  printer? I still don't understand how that works to change to the thing or. I'm sure we'll figure
[4747.66s -> 4758.87s]  it out. Takes a random one. What is it? I think it's first in line on the left. It's slow. I would
[4758.87s -> 4767.13s]  lose my shield. What is this? Another fucking cube. I already have one of these. Have we even found the
[4767.13s -> 4771.93s]  teleporter? It's gotta be up. It's a random item. We're almost in heart. Random item of the same
[4771.93s -> 4782.07s]  tier. Yeah we're spending way too much time here. Random item of the same tier. Printers take random
[4782.07s -> 4791.72s]  items of the same rarity. Preferring duplicates. And it's a random item of the same tier. What's
[4791.72s -> 4799.67s]  this one? Stun grenade. There's no order to it. It's just random. Good to know. Uh where is this
[4799.67s -> 4807.54s]  teleporter? Good to know. Where is this teleporter? Turn invisible. I'm taking heavy damage. That's
[4807.54s -> 4819.37s]  cool. It has to be right. It has to be up. It's gotta be. Yeah it's gotta be like on one of these
[4819.37s -> 4826.01s]  platforms somewhere. It's over there where I'm pointing. Where? Point at the screen. Point?
[4827.13s -> 4829.77s]  Just draw a line with your finger. You guys like. With your greasy fingers.
[4830.65s -> 4837.05s]  And like cosmic knowledge. You know what I mean? Like if every single one of you there's like
[4837.05s -> 4846.92s]  there's like what? 3,000 people here. 3,500 something like that. Total. If all of you point
[4846.92s -> 4851.88s]  at the same part of the screen. Like will I sense it? Because like we have to have the heat map on
[4851.88s -> 4862.34s]  for that. You have to turn the heat map on right now. Turn on smart click. Yeah that is what it
[4862.34s -> 4879.02s]  would be. Uh is it down here? I think I see it. Uh I don't I don't know. I haven't seen any orange
[4879.02s -> 4889.06s]  sparkles. Down here? It's down there. Maybe maybe maybe. Oh come on. We actually missed it. Is this
[4889.06s -> 4894.66s]  bugged? Fail the shrine of chance three times in a row. We missed it. We went down here already.
[4897.00s -> 4906.73s]  It's not a nice achievement that I just got. Any other items and boxes and shit down here?
[4907.29s -> 4909.99s]  I gotta we gotta turn this on man. We're gonna be in hard.
[4912.41s -> 4919.91s]  Four in a row? Come on. Is this bugged? Did you get that achievement? No you did. Yeah I got it um
[4919.91s -> 4924.55s]  for that. I activated the shrine of chance and failed four times in a row. I lost three hundred
[4924.55s -> 4933.13s]  dollars. I just went to the casino and then came back to the stream. I have so many little drones
[4933.13s -> 4940.52s]  everywhere. A coin. What? A coin? Coins? A coin. All right you ready? Wait wait wait. Literally a
[4940.52s -> 4949.40s]  coin. Where? Get the coin. What I what do you mean coin? Where's the coin? Do you see a coin?
[4951.00s -> 4956.60s]  If I did what I tell you I would just take it. Is that it? All right I found it. Oh there is a coin.
[4956.60s -> 4964.90s]  There is like a giant blue coin. Yeah there's a coin right there. Oh did I get it? Does this
[4964.90s -> 4974.47s]  travel with us? Uh Tanner whatever your name is. Tano taco. Do I have to spend this here?
[4975.03s -> 4982.28s]  All right we're gonna turn this on man. This is gonna be we're gonna get overwhelmed.
[4982.28s -> 4990.98s]  Well what are you waiting for? I just turned it on. What is it?
[4990.98s -> 4999.40s]  Beetle queen. Oh the beetle queen. Is this dumb thing? That's a ride. Where? I don't know. Beetle
[4999.40s -> 5007.80s]  queen. Maybe she can't fit down here. Anybody see a beetle queen? Keep shooting your stupid companion.
[5008.44s -> 5018.62s]  Oh she's back here. It's a very nice companion though. Don't be mean to my companion. Don't worry.
[5019.88s -> 5023.48s]  Okay I won't. I just I forgot this is not a dodge roll. I just may have just killed myself. To be
[5023.48s -> 5040.62s]  fair though your companion is blocking my permacritz. All right what we got? What do we
[5040.62s -> 5048.89s]  got for items? Uh I don't even see any. A couple over here. There's one. There's a green and a
[5048.89s -> 5052.57s]  I'll take this one. All right I'll take this one. This is another jump right? I want my own beetle
[5052.57s -> 5061.54s]  guard. Yeah we're gonna have two beetles. So that's good 74 percent. I keep forgetting I have an extra
[5061.54s -> 5072.60s]  jump already. You have to scream for crits like Mike activated. Beetle queen is so easy compared
[5072.60s -> 5076.42s]  to others. All right well we'll have a second. Is there anything else to open down here?
[5077.22s -> 5097.35s]  Something else. Come on. I don't think there is. Nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing.
[5102.87s -> 5110.78s]  Are you at the teleporter? Hey you can do a 93 percent HP. I dare you. What? That uh blood
[5110.78s -> 5114.30s]  pact. Yeah but we don't have any money to spend. I mean we don't have any. I have 500 bucks I don't
[5114.30s -> 5123.02s]  know where to spend it. Yeah this box is maybe something down here. These are all open. They'd
[5123.02s -> 5133.90s]  probably be the ones like elevated ones higher up. Just turns into XP. Yeah let's just do it.
[5133.90s -> 5141.21s]  We're we gotta try to get through the next thing before it gets it very hard. Back to it. Do the
[5141.21s -> 5152.33s]  shrine. Didn't do chance shrine. No I didn't. Yeah I can't spend any of this money. We gotta go.
[5155.72s -> 5164.09s]  Yeah we have to get out of here. We really do. On my way. Chance shrines are good. We'll do it next
[5164.09s -> 5176.49s]  time. Chance shrine is always worth it. Well that does not feel good but. Do it now. We'll do it
[5176.49s -> 5186.71s]  next time. We'll do well I'll do it tomorrow. All right this is where we got one more after this
[5186.71s -> 5192.60s]  right and we died on that one. We got we were insane at that point. Let's really try to clean
[5192.60s -> 5220.02s]  this up. That hurts. Dear. So the levels increase base stats I assume. Uh I it looks like it yeah.
[5220.82s -> 5235.72s]  Okay items. It's always like a dollar away. I don't I don't know what that is. Why am I shooting him?
[5235.72s -> 5244.76s]  He's my friend. What is this? Fungus heal all nearby allies after standing still for two seconds.
[5246.81s -> 5251.13s]  I had that one earlier and didn't use it one time. Everyone said it sucked so I just. That's
[5251.13s -> 5266.63s]  unfortunate. But I thought oh well. That's too many. What is what is this what's why does this
[5266.63s -> 5274.54s]  have a broken clock on it? 9 59. Somebody unplugged their VCR. What does that mean?
[5281.64s -> 5291.24s]  There's my friends. You need to get to this level before 10 minutes. Oh enemies on hit. There we go.
[5291.24s -> 5296.92s]  What is this thing? Why is it only 60 bucks? Is this like a Amazon drone? What is this? That was
[5296.92s -> 5305.51s]  that's crazy. 15 minutes on multiplayer. Oh it's like a booster. All right I'm looking for one of
[5305.51s -> 5315.61s]  those lunar boxes. So you can spend your lunar coin? Yeah I mean first time we've ever had it.
[5315.61s -> 5321.58s]  Might as well see what it is. I was thinking about maybe giving it to you. I was thinking about
[5321.58s -> 5340.84s]  gasoline. Well you shouldn't have. This is hurting me bad. Okay they're really keen on the bandolier
[5340.84s -> 5349.80s]  right now. Wait save coins for a new character. I found the uh teleporter. Wait you mean that
[5349.80s -> 5357.08s]  currency stays forever? Yeah this the currency stays forever. Forever. Forever. What the fuck?
[5357.08s -> 5369.50s]  Okay that's good to know. I hope you're enjoying my scarab friend down there. I assume he earns me
[5369.50s -> 5382.46s]  money actually. Yeah I think so. That's pretty awesome. All right give me some boxes. We might
[5382.46s -> 5396.70s]  consider turning it on here in a minute. I got the stupid heal thing again. And 316 bucks. Should
[5396.70s -> 5406.34s]  I pick the missile launcher or the cube? Missile launcher. I'm talking about actives. Probably the
[5406.34s -> 5417.85s]  cube. Yeah it's kind of nice having the black hole for crowd control stuff. Yeah it is. Chance. Oh
[5417.85s -> 5426.06s]  I got the happy mask too. You have that? Oh I had it last time. It was pretty good. Chance to bleed.
[5426.06s -> 5435.05s]  I have a couple of these don't I? How many of these do I have? Two. All right partner what do you say?
[5435.53s -> 5442.71s]  Yeah I think it's pretty much go time. You're kind of far away though. Yeah I'm coming back.
[5457.30s -> 5461.46s]  All right might as well uh turn it on. I got dibs on this chest real quick.
[5461.46s -> 5469.21s]  This chest real quick. I just need like 30 more bucks. Why not? Just I'll just open it for you.
[5469.85s -> 5480.63s]  Here take it. Oh let's go. I'm like hurt. I'm gonna use this now like I'm fucking I'm actually
[5480.63s -> 5488.07s]  hurt. I need to like not die. All right what is it? Clay dune. It's a big machine. Oh they were all
[5488.07s -> 5496.34s]  grouped up for that. I love it. Did you say that is the bomb? It was great. Just keep doing that shit.
[5497.14s -> 5519.13s]  So he's he's in the air. I don't know what that means. I'm pretty much just focusing the boss
[5519.13s -> 5536.79s]  right now but also dying. Oh my god. Whoa. Oh there's more than one. He's split. He's just pulling
[5536.79s -> 5550.12s]  us in. Can I can we out range that? He's got like um mechanite tendrils. All right one dead.
[5550.84s -> 5555.08s]  One down. Oh my god why'd I do that? I didn't mean to do that. I'm just gonna stand still.
[5555.88s -> 5561.56s]  Are you getting healed? I am getting healed by also my own body. All right I'm gonna come over
[5561.56s -> 5569.51s]  here. Let's see what this does. Stand in that circle and how good is the heal? It's like actually
[5569.51s -> 5586.20s]  worth doing. Uh I don't know. Oh probably not. No. Well that item is um questionable at best.
[5586.84s -> 5594.78s]  Stand still for two seconds. You got this. You're doing good. You're doing great. You're doing
[5594.78s -> 5613.10s]  great. Is that like 10 percent? 15 percent? Come on dots dots dots dots man. Four percent. Two percent.
[5613.82s -> 5621.61s]  Hit it hard. Hit it hard. Cool downs. Warrior. Hey my turn to get the achievement. All right
[5621.61s -> 5630.12s]  these look the same so I'll take one. The fungus is nicely done for out of combat. That makes sense.
[5633.21s -> 5641.10s]  Why is he still alive? I don't know. Good question. You can take both. You can take both since you're
[5641.10s -> 5650.36s]  dead. I'm dead. Take them both. You're dead? Yeah I'm dead. Wait when did you die? Uh when I screamed.
[5650.44s -> 5655.82s]  Remember I was like let me try this. Let me stand still for two seconds and I was like
[5655.82s -> 5659.58s]  you getting healed by that? I instantly died and the meteor hit me in the head and killed me.
[5659.58s -> 5664.86s]  Oh okay well let's I have 1400 bucks but I don't have anything to spend it on because I searched
[5664.86s -> 5672.70s]  this whole area for boxes first. So let's just go. If you got the cash then spend it. There was
[5672.70s -> 5677.26s]  nothing to spend. All right well we're good. All right this is where we got to last time and I'm
[5677.26s -> 5684.46s]  already halfway dead. We are now on impossible. There's a weird is a hard balance here with
[5684.46s -> 5693.29s]  trying to pick up items and going quickly. It's cool. I'm oh yeah I don't know man we might have
[5693.29s -> 5700.55s]  taken too long. Yeah but probably I mean I'm fighting like a boss as a normal enemy. This is
[5700.55s -> 5707.77s]  our wall right now. This is our like newbie wall. Going quickly is way more important. Yeah
[5710.76s -> 5716.36s]  we got we got mechanics down pretty closely now. We should probably just try and do a uh
[5717.00s -> 5727.83s]  like a speedy speedy run to the first two areas. Oh my god. Yeah there's like a dinosaur boss in
[5727.83s -> 5743.22s]  here. That is who has been pursuing me. Slowed. The inability to shoot straight up is very annoying
[5743.22s -> 5754.12s]  against that guy and there's some kind of turtle guy. The 10-minute chest is a weird item. Also
[5754.12s -> 5761.58s]  Geb is useless right here. Geb does not know how to path find. I'm dead. I think I caught fire.
[5761.58s -> 5769.75s]  You dead? I'm alive again though because I had an item. So that's pretty cool. Okay this that giant
[5769.75s -> 5778.55s]  snake thing is around. How do you stop burning to death? Roll. Like every video game right? That's
[5778.55s -> 5783.91s]  what I think but it didn't seem to be doing anything. Well that's really great. Wish I had
[5783.91s -> 5792.70s]  that earlier. I can dash twice three times probably. All right we're just like circling
[5792.70s -> 5797.66s]  everybody and just killing enemies. Oh we're so fucked. I'm trying to kill this one like lizard.
[5797.66s -> 5812.23s]  The fire lizard. We're so dead. All right looking for the teleporter. He's dead. That was big money.
[5812.23s -> 5826.14s]  Big money. Uh orange flakes. I don't see any orange flakes over here. Wait I see an orange
[5826.14s -> 5831.27s]  flake right there. Orange flakes. All right I got it. It's down here. We're going from impossible
[5831.27s -> 5838.28s]  to I see something. I see dead people right. Teleport is right here. Should I just turn it on?
[5839.32s -> 5846.15s]  Um I'm not gonna tell you not to because I just don't know. Well here. I'm gonna die with that
[5846.15s -> 5864.60s]  with or without it. So apparently I'm missile guide now. Maybe we'll get lucky. All right you're
[5864.60s -> 5874.60s]  ready. I'm just gonna turn it on. Who is it? Imp Overlord. Imp Overlord. All right I'm coming to
[5874.60s -> 5877.64s]  you. Thank you. No I thought he's coming to you. All right he's doesn't have that much health.
[5878.52s -> 5885.82s]  He's pretty weak. Just burn him. Hold on I'm not I'm not even I can't even see him. So I'm coming.
[5886.54s -> 5900.71s]  I'm on my way. Yeah I am super jump missile guy now. All right I'm helping. Where's he going?
[5900.79s -> 5912.12s]  He's invisible. Ah cancelled it. I think we're gonna do this. Uh he's he's focused on me now
[5913.80s -> 5930.89s]  and here he comes. We cleaned up a lot of enemies there. Just watch. So he's intangible while
[5930.89s -> 5950.10s]  invisible and cannot be heard. All right we got a lot of enemies coming in. Big skull man. The boss
[5950.10s -> 5955.90s]  he's almost he's at like less than a quarter. I'm about to go full crit. Oh and he just went
[5955.90s -> 5959.50s]  invisible. I'm trying to take care of the adds. There's so many of them coming in. They all found
[5959.50s -> 5967.46s]  us at the same time. We got it. Kill him. He's almost dead. Yes. All right clean this up.
[5968.18s -> 5978.79s]  We're good. 97 percent. Uh shrine of the mountain. Someone was like wait till they
[5978.79s -> 5982.23s]  pray to the shrine of the mountain earlier. So I'm gonna wait until we're done to like press
[5982.23s -> 5986.79s]  that button. All right so that's good. You're not gonna debate me that easily. I see you. All right
[5986.79s -> 5991.85s]  I'm gonna get this one. You get the other one. So uh we can move on. Do you want to pray to the
[5991.85s -> 5997.61s]  shrine of the mountain and possibly die. Um somebody said it won't work now.
[5998.41s -> 6001.05s]  It won't do anything now. Well then I can still pray to it though.
[6001.77s -> 6008.39s]  You've invited the challenge of the mountain. Oh so we were debated just not in the way we
[6008.39s -> 6014.33s]  thought. So it doesn't do anything. Apparently it only does stuff before teleporting. It affects
[6014.33s -> 6020.65s]  the boss fight. Let's spawn this guy. Holy shit man. My heart is fucking racing. We got it.
[6022.52s -> 6028.65s]  Holy shit. I can't believe it. Have you been through here? Uh no. The new difficulty is I
[6028.65s -> 6035.27s]  see you. Uh challenge of the mountain makes the boss fight harder with more rewards. I see you.
[6036.22s -> 6049.45s]  Hey chat. I see you. And he I got a lot of money. Well rub it in. That took a while for me to
[6049.45s -> 6057.56s]  understand what you were saying here. This is a useless tunnel um for my 1400 bucks. Is there
[6057.56s -> 6069.10s]  nothing there? Absolutely zero. All right well. It's a very sad tunnel. Some developer worked
[6069.10s -> 6074.73s]  really hard on this. Well it's procedurally generated. They probably worked hard on the
[6074.73s -> 6079.21s]  tunnel portion but not on where it was gonna end up. I can't believe Notch made this game.
[6079.21s -> 6095.67s]  All right I'm pressing the button. You ready? Oh no no no. And after I pick this up. Okay I'm ready.
[6095.67s -> 6102.17s]  We haven't seen this. Detonate enemies on kill. Only three people made this game.
[6102.17s -> 6109.06s]  Okay let me guess they're all in chat right now. Probably uh what's this is interesting.
[6110.92s -> 6119.03s]  Distant Roost. Loop back to the first stage. Loop back Deja Vu. Should we beat it? We beat it again. Nice.
[6119.03s -> 6127.34s]  Well that's one that's one way to deal with early access. Am I right? So now we just kind
[6127.34s -> 6133.66s]  of cycle through and it gets harder. All right there's um okay um ha ha ha the loud laughter is
[6133.66s -> 6149.08s]  coming up in a minute here. Oh I thought that. Oh yes loud very loud laughter. Holy shit these
[6149.08s -> 6160.71s]  guys take so many hits. So is there something after ha ha ha? I guess we'll have to survive
[6160.71s -> 6174.07s]  long enough to find out. Uh the answer is no apparently. Struggling to kill one beetle.
[6174.63s -> 6190.94s]  Bounce it bounce it bounce it bounce it bounce it. Level up. Man these guys are so tanky.
[6193.86s -> 6199.35s]  It keeps getting harder but there's no new name for it. Okay. So it's like a progression thing
[6199.35s -> 6204.39s]  right? Yeah I think we did the equivalent of like finding of Isaac beating mom or something
[6205.77s -> 6216.65s]  for the first time. So the idea is to try to get to this point by like hard or very hard
[6219.02s -> 6222.94s]  and just cycle around. Other people are saying in risk of rain one like this
[6223.66s -> 6229.94s]  though it's optional you can go to the end game or loop again. So by saying the end game do you mean
[6229.94s -> 6237.37s]  like start over or is this endless mode? Oh every teleport increases difficulty by one so you can't
[6237.37s -> 6250.07s]  do what I'm describing. Okay that's cool. Secret item glasses. Oh that's the crit. I gotta remember
[6250.07s -> 6260.79s]  that. Here it comes. What'd you find? The ha ha ha. Oh we're there. I wonder how many people are
[6260.79s -> 6267.13s]  gonna get timed out. By nightbot automatically. At some point after you loop back you can open
[6267.13s -> 6271.85s]  another portal for the end. What is this? You are embraced by the healing warmth of the woods.
[6272.65s -> 6277.78s]  That's a lot of money for a heal. Well it looks like we already have the heal. I think it's on the
[6277.78s -> 6294.18s]  ground. This must just stay. It's nice and centralized. Whoops got overwhelmed. Yeah those
[6294.18s -> 6302.97s]  are my friends. I'm just gonna stay in the heal. Never mind that's a bad idea. Move fast out of
[6302.97s -> 6319.51s]  combat. That's a joke right? No I need to open a box. Fine I'll activate this one too. Oh we're
[6319.51s -> 6324.23s]  we are in ha ha ha zone. We should probably mine the teleporter huh? It's probably. I think
[6324.23s -> 6328.23s]  it's right here. And just see what ha ha ha difficulty teleporter looks like. Well it's
[6328.23s -> 6334.23s]  right next to me. You want me to press it? Yeah it's right up here. Uh let me open one last box.
[6334.23s -> 6340.87s]  Ooh what's that? Cheat death once. I get to die once. What is this? Gunner drone? All right I'll do
[6340.87s -> 6350.70s]  the gunner. I'm ready. All right let's do it. It is the beetle queen on ha ha ha difficulty.
[6351.58s -> 6358.46s]  So there's two healers down here. It spawns three of them actually. My bad three
[6358.46s -> 6365.16s]  beetle queens. So if you start getting low go down into the heal fields below in the valley.
[6366.30s -> 6381.46s]  Will do. Oh okay well I'm doing that now. Can we make this better? I don't think so. Yeah that's
[6381.46s -> 6390.98s]  pretty good escape to get down there. What do these bugs do? I think that they like have like a weird
[6390.98s -> 6399.70s]  AOA field. I thought it was a heal at first but that's definitely not what it is. Oh god. Somehow
[6399.70s -> 6405.32s]  I'm just right in the middle of all of them. There's so many of them. Their circles are taking
[6405.32s -> 6418.23s]  up so much screen real estate I can't even see through them. What's going on? Suck them all in.
[6422.20s -> 6429.42s]  Oh my god there's so many people over there. There really are they like can't move over.
[6429.42s -> 6443.22s]  Look at that. This is all damage numbers. That's awesome. Look at them flying around too.
[6443.94s -> 6452.78s]  I'm going retreating back to the heal. Who's laughing now game? The game's going to continue
[6452.78s -> 6458.95s]  to laugh I think until until it's over. It's going to it's a continuous laugh out loud.
[6460.14s -> 6465.82s]  That is very is very funny. Oh god. How am I negating so much damage?
[6468.62s -> 6472.46s]  It's like one of these laser. Because I'm standing right next to them like.
[6472.46s -> 6476.62s]  Whoa! Oh my god I'm dead. I just got rained on. What just dropped on me?
[6477.50s -> 6483.82s]  Why am I alive again? Oh fuck I can cheat death right. Are those bugs dropping those?
[6483.82s -> 6489.67s]  I think they might be. Maybe. I just got fucking wrecked. All right two out of three are dead.
[6490.82s -> 6496.09s]  Whoops. Whoops. No actually that's a good thing. Holy shit this is gonna be fucking wild.
[6501.30s -> 6507.94s]  Where are all these bugs? Dude this is fucking insane. Are those your bugs? No. Oh I'm dead.
[6508.58s -> 6514.71s]  No. I wasn't gonna be dead but then I died. I think I went from half health to zero.
[6516.01s -> 6525.21s]  Got one shot. Oh my god there's so many things. Please. I did most of the work for the.
[6525.21s -> 6539.19s]  Oh no. There's just no way man. No way. We got to see new stuff. That was cool. What is the red pub
[6539.99s -> 6548.89s]  zone for? That's the teleporter charge zone. You just stand inside the red to charge the tele.
[6557.24s -> 6563.08s]  Kills. We did good. That's right. We've come a long way from dying on the first level. I unlocked
[6563.08s -> 6571.32s]  a new character. Like you. The character's fun. I kind of do miss being able to aim and shoot though.
[6571.32s -> 6580.65s]  I feel like when I play this character I like the AOE is amazing but sometimes when I'm just
[6580.65s -> 6585.05s]  holding the button down it's kind of hard to tell where who I'm even shooting at but still. Yeah
[6585.05s -> 6593.82s]  because the bolts just kind of fly off into a random direction. Yeah. It makes sense. It's
[6593.82s -> 6603.88s]  the only character with auto aimed. I'll go back to this guy. I'll switch off. Okay. Let me read
[6603.88s -> 6613.10s]  my abilities first. Is there a way we can see how to unlock enemies? I mean classes? I can't really
[6613.10s -> 6629.34s]  scroll over anything. Go to the log. Log book. I don't have to go back though. I don't want to
[6629.34s -> 6641.62s]  leave the menu. Wait am I still in a party with you if I go back to the menu? Looks good. You can
[6641.62s -> 6646.26s]  look in the log book to see how to unlock these apparently. Yeah let's just do that. On the main
[6646.26s -> 6657.40s]  menu. Let's just do that might as well see. Oh this is cool. All right survivor. Complete 30 stages.
[6657.40s -> 6662.86s]  Yep so we're probably not too far. I mean we're probably like halfway. Free the survivor. There's
[6662.86s -> 6670.41s]  somebody we can free. Suspended in time. Obliterate yourself at the obelisk and complete the first
[6670.41s -> 6676.81s]  teleporter five times. Okay well we'll get this one and this one probably. Yeah the second and
[6676.81s -> 6682.31s]  sixth for sure. If you're gonna play Huntress the best part about it is you can shoot while
[6682.31s -> 6694.79s]  sprinting so just keep that in mind. And we'll check it out. Items and equipment. Okay this one
[6694.79s -> 6700.70s]  and this one while talking to him. Now he knows what I'm talking about. Yeah I know this is the
[6700.70s -> 6704.70s]  second and fifth one. The one where you do so many levels and you do the teleporter five times. Yeah.
[6705.42s -> 6715.54s]  Right. Yeah oh yeah. On the same page. He's got it. We're on the same page. All right I'm ready. Is
[6715.54s -> 6721.14s]  there any customization? I don't think so. I think they're like I don't think there is customization
[6721.14s -> 6725.54s]  but I think the thing I remember reading they were most excited about for 3D was every item you pick
[6725.54s -> 6732.66s]  up in the game is on the character somehow. That's cool. I didn't even know that was happening until
[6732.66s -> 6737.22s]  you just said it. Yeah so now you can look if you pick up the ukulele you get a ukulele if you pick
[6737.22s -> 6743.46s]  up the crowbar you get a crowbar. What a fun fucking game huh. All right let's play with our new
[6743.46s -> 6754.01s]  friend. All right let's go. The huntress who seems a little squishy. What's your base health? 110.
[6754.73s -> 6763.86s]  Yeah so I get 20 less hp. So the theory is let's try to just get this doing this as fast as possible
[6763.86s -> 6769.18s]  get a couple get one or two items let's go. Let's try to burn through this. Find the teleporter.
[6772.26s -> 6781.03s]  I love making me the boss killer. I got enough like what else do I have a right click.
[6788.94s -> 6793.50s]  So many boxes right here. I found the teleporter. You have you ping it? Yeah.
[6798.92s -> 6809.35s]  Why are you like right next to it? Yeah right here. I need a box. There's some over by me.
[6814.39s -> 6821.26s]  I feel like um like Artemis. Is that why you were getting like the smite vibes? I feel like I'm
[6821.26s -> 6826.70s]  playing Artemis and smite. There's little enemies all right cool. All right I say we go for it.
[6826.70s -> 6830.46s]  Yeah let's go. I'm doing this. I just did the thing. All right three two one open.
[6831.26s -> 6848.92s]  Beat the coin. May as well stand in the bubble here. Oops oh that's okay that's first time I
[6848.92s -> 6869.35s]  push that button. Watch out for the poison in the ground. I can't click it fast enough. I need to
[6869.35s -> 6873.43s]  be way close. Oh I did it anyway. That worked nice. I'm just trying to help out with the adds
[6873.43s -> 6878.23s]  so we don't get overwhelmed too early. I leveled up right next to the boss which is kind of scary
[6878.23s -> 6885.03s]  because she does like a aoe really close but I have the uh war banner down.
[6887.32s -> 6906.70s]  There's a bunch of people behind us. Be careful. Oops forget that I have a teleport. All right
[6906.70s -> 6923.94s]  clean it up. Sick. All right and then for the loot which I don't see. Is there no loot in the ground?
[6923.94s -> 6934.20s]  I got a lunar coin. It should be. Where'd that come from? All right okay I see I got there's an onion
[6934.20s -> 6944.41s]  and there's a vr headset. I'll just you want the rare one or you want the let's go it's a beetle
[6944.41s -> 6950.42s]  guard. All right boxes any boxes left that we didn't get before you keep going. I definitely
[6950.42s -> 6961.05s]  have money. Yeah we just move. I think we just gotta go. We're still in easy. Just rifle through.
[6961.77s -> 6967.13s]  Oh yeah just activate it. We don't get time. What the teleporter? Yeah we don't get time. I just
[6967.13s -> 6977.00s]  found like four boxes. You would have made me miss out on so much loot. Well we gotta go gotta go
[6977.00s -> 6985.96s]  gotta go gotta go. Okay wait wait well hold on wait hold on wait wait wait. So let me understand
[6985.96s -> 6995.26s]  this. When we go in this teleporter it's going to just go to medium automatically. Uh that sounds
[6995.26s -> 7004.46s]  right. So we have as much time as we want. No no people saying no. Yes. No yes. No I think so. No
[7004.46s -> 7012.92s]  yes. No well let's just go. Okay I'm ready. Look at the bar press it. Yeah well hold on
[7012.92s -> 7019.24s]  you're the one down there. Oh well I thought you were sorry. All right so let's see what happens.
[7020.55s -> 7024.47s]  We're halfway through easy right now. We're halfway through easy. We're pouring on out.
[7026.65s -> 7031.69s]  I think it just goes up yeah it just goes up some. Okay so it goes up like a almost a full one of
[7031.69s -> 7041.30s]  those pieces of bubblegum band-aid. It just goes up a tick. It goes up a full band-aid. Have we
[7041.30s -> 7048.15s]  done this yet? This looks new. Maybe it's because we actually beat the game on the other thing and
[7048.15s -> 7056.22s]  we get a new rotation in like a nice desert map. It goes up by one of those quadrants. Quadrants
[7056.22s -> 7074.34s]  means four sorry. It goes up by a basketball period. Exactly oh that's what that does. I have
[7074.34s -> 7087.08s]  like um the queen bee but evil. Like your friend but bad but mean. It's you but stronger. Okay I'm
[7087.08s -> 7100.47s]  seeing. Oh getting shot. Also known as a third. Yeah it is it is broken up into thirds. Yes I
[7100.47s -> 7121.67s]  was gaming. If anything it's uh more damage to healthy enemies. It's a freezer. 151 dollars for
[7121.67s -> 7134.65s]  these robots. I need some more boxes. Seems uh pretty sparse out here. Yeah it does. Um I'll take
[7134.65s -> 7150.66s]  some help. This is one of those shrines over here. All right I got 145 bucks right there. 125 dollars
[7150.66s -> 7164.44s]  come on. It better be good. It is. Wow what is this thing? Is it bad? All right that's kind of weird
[7164.44s -> 7173.06s]  because killing an enemy like pulls out my fov. Uh what's your special? It's I get like a frost
[7173.06s -> 7182.63s]  aura when I kill something. This actually is pretty awesome. All right good good pick up.
[7183.19s -> 7188.97s]  All right we should probably get started here. I've got like one box since we got here.
[7188.97s -> 7196.20s]  Oh okay. I found a shrine of combat if you want to come over here. Oh yeah let me just grab this
[7196.20s -> 7202.04s]  one box and I will join you shortly. This is not a box. I already picked that up. All right I'm coming.
[7202.76s -> 7217.27s]  You can get melee. That's pretty awesome. Extra damage to bosses. Nice. What is this thing?
[7218.22s -> 7222.78s]  There's two shrines of combat here I think. Shrine okay there's a shrine of the mountain right there.
[7222.78s -> 7231.90s]  Oh boy. Do you sure do we dare do that? Maybe. Should we go for it? Maybe. All right let's turn
[7231.90s -> 7242.30s]  it on. I'm gonna activate it. All right the boss is gonna be harder. Invited a challenge to the
[7242.30s -> 7251.58s]  mountain. All right come to me. We're still in early game so it's not that big of a deal apparently
[7251.58s -> 7256.30s]  so should be good. Whatever they're just trying to take away from our accomplishments future or past.
[7257.02s -> 7264.57s]  No they're trying to help. Yeah it's not that big of a deal. Okay I do that all the time on super
[7264.57s -> 7273.11s]  hard mode okay. I have a I have 120 hours in this game already. 120? I got a lot of money. I need
[7273.11s -> 7278.66s]  something to spend this on. All right come here. Now you know. Turn it on. Activate this. I'm here.
[7279.38s -> 7297.45s]  Is that the thing? Is that the challenge cube? I don't know. I guess. Did we just get like a bunch
[7297.45s -> 7304.86s]  of money? I think so. I mean there's more stuff here. That's yours. That one's your guy. There's
[7304.86s -> 7313.94s]  another challenge cube though. Press it? Over here I guess. All these boxes are open. All right
[7313.94s -> 7322.38s]  that spawned. Yeah who did that? Okay that spawned this guy. These guys here. Oh lag. Yeah I got the
[7322.38s -> 7335.35s]  lag too. We're just gonna we just get a bunch of money for this. All right we should probably do
[7335.35s -> 7345.22s]  the teleporter now. Uh yeah I got we got a lot of money. Where are we gonna spend it all? I don't
[7345.22s -> 7353.14s]  know. I don't see any more boxes. Rock music. I'm just gonna have to convert. I don't see anything.
[7355.32s -> 7366.09s]  Um do I want to go really fast? Teleport is this way. What he doesn't know? What do you mean?
[7367.05s -> 7376.10s]  Wait what? He knows. What do you mean? He doesn't know. Should we tell him chat? Should we? All right
[7376.10s -> 7385.69s]  there's a ton of boxes over here by the teleporter. Oh one. I meant sorry. I meant to say one box.
[7386.25s -> 7391.30s]  I thought I thought there was more. You ready? Three. Is ready because we're probably ever going
[7391.30s -> 7404.55s]  to be. This is one. This is soup. This is a hard boss mode. Oh boy. Yep there's multiple uh robots.
[7404.55s -> 7417.77s]  Just try to focus on the big one in the middle here. That's a bunch of robots. Yes there are.
[7418.65s -> 7427.46s]  No. What did I end up? What just happened? Oh fuck. Okay. All right. I keep like falling off the
[7427.46s -> 7437.08s]  fucking edge. Oh this is bad. This is real bad. What is even hitting me from behind?
[7441.88s -> 7448.23s]  Oh that edge. Oh this is bad. Okay. Oh we're dead. We're dead. Game over. Oh you're dead. Oh yeah I got
[7448.23s -> 7462.76s]  destroyed. Yeah it's not good. Good luck. Thanks. Shrine of the Mountain sometimes makes an elite
[7462.76s -> 7469.67s]  boss too. It adds a boss. Okay so Shrine of the Mountain adds a boss to the level and the boss
[7469.67s -> 7477.90s]  can be elite. Oh boy. I forget that teleport only goes forward and I'm used to like dodge rolling
[7477.90s -> 7494.94s]  backward. Are there three? No there's only two. Help me. I don't I don't want to go back into that.
[7494.94s -> 7506.60s]  There are three. They're standing inside of my fun zone. Wait so we got two by default and then one
[7506.60s -> 7518.90s]  extra or one by default and then two extra? All right goodbye. Good night. Yeah we got two extra
[7518.90s -> 7535.38s]  bosses by the way if you're curious. I need to get in there. Oh no it's two by default. Oh 11, 14, 15
[7535.38s -> 7555.51s]  health. Oh very solid attempt. That was a solid. Very sad. I had the frost aura too. Later on you
[7555.51s -> 7568.81s]  can get like nine bosses at once with three shrines. Wow that's ridiculous. Well that was
[7570.01s -> 7575.06s]  certainly a challenge. They were just trying to help clear the level for me too yeah. Later on
[7575.06s -> 7581.14s]  you can get nine bosses with like three shrines. You can spawn nine of those things. I guess we
[7581.14s -> 7590.52s]  need to go. We do. We do. We do. We do. Thank you so great Canadian fuck love 10 community subs.
[7590.52s -> 7600.28s]  Thank you. Thank you so much. All right dips. Hey dips. Thank you for those subs.
[7601.14s -> 7608.68s]  You're welcome. Hey thanks Tal. Thank you Tal. That was me. That's been you the whole time. Yeah I'm
[7608.68s -> 7624.58s]  anonymous. I don't believe that. Dropping subs. I gotta get there. All right play good for a minute.
[7624.58s -> 7631.05s]  I need to do something. Play good. Okay I can steal all the boxes. But no thank you for real.
[7631.05s -> 7638.73s]  That's a lot. I'm just going to set up a key line so I can mute. So I don't talk over.
[7639.61s -> 7657.50s]  Why can I not set this right here? Oh god damn it. Whatever. He's muted too. All right move off.
[7657.50s -> 7663.83s]  Okay that's a nod if I haven't seen. Move faster. Just in general not even while sprinting. Just a
[7663.83s -> 7677.96s]  generalized move faster huh. Yeah just I have like a cast on. I love double jump. That's probably one
[7677.96s -> 7683.82s]  of my favorite ones. What is that? Healing drone? All right I want that. Come on give me like another
[7683.82s -> 7689.83s]  two dollars. Three dollars. Yeah the right click is crazy strong on the huntress. Yeah it bounces
[7689.83s -> 7696.54s]  around too. It's really good. You can stack 10 of those and have speed hacks. That's insane.
[7698.14s -> 7702.55s]  That's the best item in the entire game. If you get like three or four of them.
[7706.12s -> 7717.80s]  We got something down here. Lots of boxes. Lots of boxes over here. Three boxes over here.
[7717.80s -> 7721.96s]  Oh it's okay. What happens if you fall? Because it makes me feel like I'm going to insta die.
[7722.12s -> 7726.52s]  It teleports you back and you lose health. Okay so it's just like a slight health loops.
[7727.24s -> 7735.82s]  That's good. Any bear? Around the porter. Did you find it? There's a couple boxes in case we want
[7735.82s -> 7743.93s]  to pop it. I'm out of money so there's like I would say I'm ready. You ready? I mean I'm as
[7743.93s -> 7749.45s]  ready as I'm gonna be I think. I need more money but there's a health hurt yourself thing here.
[7749.45s -> 7753.77s]  There's a health hurt yourself for money thing. There's a hurt yourself for money thing over here.
[7756.25s -> 7765.58s]  Um I think that's like a different part of Vegas. All right give me give me give me give me.
[7765.58s -> 7778.07s]  It's bollying over here. Where the hell did you guys come from? There's the boss. It is we don't
[7778.07s -> 7782.87s]  we don't leave this place yet. There's about four boxes over here we can open but this is all said
[7782.87s -> 7808.15s]  and done. Don't leave. Oh don't worry I'm not going anywhere. Good. That hurt. Anyone behind
[7808.15s -> 7812.52s]  me? Yeah there is. Always check behind you. I don't know if the arrows can actually hit airborne
[7812.52s -> 7823.16s]  enemies like that but I'll try anyways. Oh god it's coming to get me. Is there damage fall off
[7823.16s -> 7830.10s]  from far away? There is. Uh good question. Yeah there is. Definitely. What the fuck just what
[7830.10s -> 7837.94s]  happened? Um I believe we stayed too close to the jellyfish and uh got exploded. What happened?
[7837.94s -> 7841.94s]  Because it does like a charge up ability where you have to get out of the circle.
[7842.66s -> 7848.58s]  We I thought I mean I was standing on like a cliff. And we both were inside of its area of influence.
[7849.22s -> 7857.29s]  Holy shit. Well that was too bad that would there was a lot of items there too. I'd rather die like
[7857.29s -> 7860.89s]  then and it's kind of like dying first floor just get it over with rip the band-aid off
[7861.75s -> 7868.31s]  and just do it again better. Stand behind so I didn't even know he it was coming at me. Okay
[7868.31s -> 7879.02s]  well that was weird. So just line of sight when he does that. Look away for two seconds dying on
[7879.02s -> 7888.71s]  level one. I'm sorry. Just look away for two more seconds and you wouldn't have known that we died.
[7888.71s -> 7895.99s]  What if you turn around and look the other way? Based on your sight? What if you just don't look
[7895.99s -> 7908.54s]  at him? If he's not on the screen he's not real. That's true. Occlusion. I think that's how game
[7908.54s -> 7913.85s]  occlusion works. If you don't look at him he's not loaded in so he's not affecting your frame rate
[7913.85s -> 7932.15s]  and thus cannot hit you. What the hell is it? What whoo oh these things. Active ability over here.
[7938.78s -> 7943.42s]  Gain 100% there it is. That's the thing you've been getting. Uh oh I almost died. That would
[7943.42s -> 7954.01s]  have been very embarrassing. Teleport is over here. Oh oh sorry I hit the DPI button on my
[7954.01s -> 7964.57s]  Razor return it death adder. Why do mice even have DPI buttons? It's just a gimmick. Nobody
[7964.57s -> 7972.33s]  actually uses them. Uh I gotta teleport you. You want to just give this a go or you want to try to
[7972.33s -> 7980.15s]  look for more items? Uh yeah whenever's fine. Let's do it. You have to kind of go through a cave to
[7980.15s -> 7993.91s]  get here. I need one penny. One penny? I got it. Uh where's teleport? Uh through the cave over here.
[7994.71s -> 8006.82s]  Any more items to get before we go? Uh not that I can see. Did you did you select them all?
[8007.38s -> 8012.58s]  I may have selected them all but all of them is like one of them. Yeah there's an active ability
[8012.58s -> 8024.78s]  one down there. Let's just go. Where is it? I still got like caught on the teleporter.
[8025.91s -> 8030.47s]  Oh it's the jellyfish again but he's in an even more difficult area. Well just like stay in the
[8030.47s -> 8036.23s]  cave. Oh no that's a probably bad idea. Yeah it's a bad idea. Uh what if he does that in the cave?
[8040.38s -> 8044.38s]  My god yeah that's we're gonna like just get eaten alive. I'm just gonna if I see him charging he's
[8044.38s -> 8057.43s]  doing it. What? Okay he's fine. All right we have a giant uh cylinder right we have a giant like
[8057.43s -> 8063.91s]  pillar to hide behind. We do but I'm not I I don't trust it to actually block. Why not? I feel like
[8063.91s -> 8068.65s]  the damage is just gonna go through. Well that's everyone in chat so that's why you just line aside
[8068.65s -> 8084.86s]  it. Here it comes. Well yeah it is it's like infinity distance so it is line of sight. What
[8084.86s -> 8093.64s]  is fucking killing me? What is killing me? Was I like burning? That guy was just burning me?
[8096.57s -> 8103.19s]  Okay that guy was just burning me. Yeah I think you were just on fire. This is the this is the
[8103.19s -> 8111.90s]  worst area for that enemy. That guy was worse than the boss. Okay he's dead. Uh these items are the
[8111.90s -> 8117.74s]  same. Dealing damage heals you. That may be the best thing I've seen all day. That's pretty good.
[8119.48s -> 8124.60s]  All right ready? Oh we have to charge it still. Uh do we have any items that we can get or do we
[8124.60s -> 8128.76s]  just go? I don't think there's any items. I think we just go. I didn't see any leftover boxes unless
[8128.76s -> 8134.92s]  there was that. Did you get the active item one? Yeah I did. Okay well then I'll say let's go. I
[8134.92s -> 8151.24s]  got the crit one. What is killing me? Gamers I need help. What is killing me? Leech is really
[8151.24s -> 8165.10s]  good with commando. Yeah it is. Lots of potential hits. All right let's speed it up. Saving money in
[8165.10s -> 8173.67s]  risk of rain. I'm not saving money. I'm trying to just get as much as I possibly can and I'm just
[8173.67s -> 8179.67s]  gonna abuse this right because I heal on hits. So why not just abuse it? Oh that's a good idea.
[8180.31s -> 8189.53s]  Right well you can only abuse it so much. I'll also take 75 and now you have to do 93 so good luck.
[8189.53s -> 8199.16s]  Okay why can I do it? Do I have to have the health? Yeah you have to have it to give it up first.
[8201.56s -> 8206.54s]  Okay it's apparently still don't have it. Okay if I get hit once I'm fucking dead.
[8209.94s -> 8214.18s]  That's dangerous. I would laugh. I don't like this thing. How much? I got another one. Fucking money.
[8214.90s -> 8222.55s]  Yeah I don't like that. That feels weird. I have enough to get a bunch of items though.
[8224.52s -> 8236.76s]  More damage to bosses. Yeah I'm like heal boy right now. There we go. Okay I'm fine.
[8236.76s -> 8247.77s]  The trade is 100% health next. Why would you even do that? For the lord be so funny.
[8248.65s -> 8259.35s]  I mean maybe if you have a thing that brings you back to life. Yeah I guess so. I find there's a
[8259.35s -> 8265.67s]  bunch of them over here. If you feel like doing 75% money. I mean they're over here. We have the
[8265.67s -> 8275.91s]  leech ability so it's not stupid. Yeah and I have health orbs on kill. You need to spend this money
[8275.91s -> 8286.95s]  though first. First and foremost. 75 is not bad. No 93 though is a little scary. More bosses to
[8286.95s -> 8295.88s]  damage. It's okay. Good choice on this one. Getting a lot of items though. So many. There's a lot of
[8295.88s -> 8305.50s]  boxes on this. Healthy enemies. Is this gasoline? What's this one? There's a ton. Increases attack
[8305.50s -> 8310.58s]  speed. I have super shield. Did it decrease? It doesn't feel like I increased very much attack
[8310.58s -> 8322.68s]  speed here. Over here. This rinds this way too. This is a. What is this duplicate? I could have
[8322.68s -> 8333.72s]  infinity banners if I wanted to. I didn't get anything. I think one banner would be fine. Okay
[8333.72s -> 8345.77s]  cool. I found the teleporter. I mean you probably already saw it but there it is. I dropped the
[8345.77s -> 8352.87s]  banner right on top of the teleporter conveniently so. I don't got a bad build. Yeah I'm feeling okay.
[8352.87s -> 8361.64s]  I don't really do a lot of damage but I have a lot of survivability. 117 bucks. All right maybe
[8361.64s -> 8367.56s]  we should ping where you are right now. I pinged the porter. Oh you got it already. Yeah so it
[8367.56s -> 8371.24s]  should be highlighted. I've got a bunch of money I don't have anything to spend it on. There's a
[8371.24s -> 8378.60s]  few boxes back here but we probably should just get going. We're not even halfway to medium so
[8378.60s -> 8386.78s]  it's not the worst. Too many elites over here. Okay what was that? Nice. So you said there's boxes by
[8386.78s -> 8397.27s]  you. There is one. There's like two. Oh I see it. I see at least one. There's a chance thing over
[8397.27s -> 8404.58s]  there. This is addicting. It is addicting yeah. What's that? You just want to make your character
[8404.58s -> 8413.96s]  like super powered. Detonate enemies on hill. And see how strong they can get. Move out of combat fast.
[8413.96s -> 8420.28s]  Move fast out of combat. Help me out chat. If you pick up two drop orb of health
[8421.74s -> 8428.44s]  and they stack is it a super orb for each enemy or two small orbs from each enemy? Looks like
[8428.44s -> 8437.30s]  one super orb. What is this? What is this shrine? Okay it's the chance shrine.
[8438.28s -> 8442.76s]  It's four hundred and like seventy dollars. Four hundred seventy dollars. I'm about to spend all my
[8442.76s -> 8448.92s]  money on whatever this is. Four hundred seventy dollars dude. A gold orb appears. What does that
[8448.92s -> 8459.70s]  mean? I don't know. There's a bunch of beetles over here. Gold orb? Go through the portal. I
[8459.70s -> 8474.23s]  don't see a portal. Portal? Gold orb portal? Where? I don't know. Apparently there's a golden
[8474.23s -> 8478.23s]  orb somewhere. The portal shows up when you kill the boss. Okay let's go kill the boss. All right
[8478.23s -> 8486.97s]  let's go do it. We're already at medium so this is gonna be a challenge. It's all right. If we die
[8486.97s -> 8494.58s]  everyone's gonna be pissed. Well that's okay. People are like I've never seen a gold orb before.
[8494.58s -> 8502.65s]  Here we go. Activate. Who is it? Stone Titan. I don't think we've seen this yet. Stone Titan.
[8502.65s -> 8509.37s]  I think it's the big stony guys. Just a bunch of them. Where the hell are they? Up there? Okay.
[8509.37s -> 8524.65s]  I'm dying already. Whoa! Okay hold on a second. What the fuck? Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow.
[8528.39s -> 8533.99s]  Oh I'm I'm I'm dying. I'm dead. Holy shit what the fuck just happened? I didn't even see the
[8533.99s -> 8543.14s]  stone titan. He's like I got shredded. I don't even know he's like up top. Fire elites they suck.
[8543.78s -> 8555.16s]  Jesus. Yeah I don't think you've seen the people that killed me yet. I almost got out here. Yeah
[8555.16s -> 8584.57s]  this is bad. I can't really go anywhere. I need to like wrap around. Okay hold on. Safety. Where are
[8584.57s -> 8604.90s]  they? Oh my god will you leave me? I had to do it. I do a lot of damage to bosses. I just don't want
[8604.90s -> 8620.92s]  to go in there with like. Okay he's over there. Is he the he's he's launching like volleys or
[8620.92s -> 8641.14s]  something? Dude he's okay he's he's I I he's he's there he is. Okay hold on. I I might be all right
[8641.14s -> 8652.58s]  here. You might be all right here except enemies are still spawning in and you're almost to heart.
[8652.58s -> 8662.86s]  I know. Oh no never mind. I'm probably dead. And then there's that guy. No no no no no no no.
[8666.44s -> 8673.82s]  It's cool that I can see your cooldowns. No I can't. I can see you're active but I
[8673.82s -> 8686.79s]  can't see your ability cooldowns. Geez. Okay hold on. If I can just farm somebody for health
[8687.51s -> 8707.06s]  for a moment. Look at all these fucking people coming over here. This is bad. It's these fire
[8707.06s -> 8718.98s]  elites. All right I'm doing okay. We're almost at heart though. I almost have a chance it's not.
[8718.98s -> 8724.71s]  I'm gonna stop the spawn. The spawn is what's killing us. He's up there but you know what?
[8724.71s -> 8733.11s]  Forget it. I'm really surprised you're still alive. Use that uh war banner. Yeah I'm just trying to
[8733.11s -> 8754.79s]  dodge around it. 99% all right. Super shot speed. Done. He's he's doing it. Okay just sniping from
[8754.79s -> 8765.26s]  back there. Fuck it. Well easy. Don't be. I'm just getting like cocky there. That was pretty dumb.
[8765.98s -> 8775.66s]  I don't like that underwater thing. Like I can't see when I aim up. Yeah I hope that
[8775.66s -> 8779.50s]  they like make it so that the camera bounces on the surface of the water or something. Yeah look
[8779.50s -> 8789.11s]  at it. I can't even see what the hell I'm doing. It's strategic. You got to think about your
[8789.11s -> 8799.29s]  placement. I'll get this. I mean we're gonna be at a very hard. I can't get down to you. He can't
[8799.29s -> 8809.19s]  shoot you. No he's. You kind of stand perfectly still and spam. Although I don't know when he's
[8809.19s -> 8812.95s]  doing his telegraph move because I'm under the water. So do I get to go through the gold portal
[8813.59s -> 8816.39s]  if I'm dead? Or do I have to watch you do the gold portal?
[8819.67s -> 8828.44s]  I guess we're gonna find out. You go ahead. Wait no I'm dead. Items. Dealing damage heals you again.
[8828.44s -> 8839.29s]  Twice. Wow. Let's do this. Go ahead. This is gonna go through. It's gonna proceed through the tele.
[8839.29s -> 8846.18s]  What? I just pressed it. How do you activate this? It said E enter portal. Oh you're going in. It's
[8846.18s -> 8853.74s]  probably loading. Oh do you come back? Are you alive? Yeah I'm alive. What? Hidden realm.
[8853.74s -> 8872.42s]  Gilded coast. At least I get to see it. All right. Just like that. Here we go. Oh my god. Rebuild the
[8872.42s -> 8879.00s]  Halleycon. Seven beacons we have to touch apparently. Oh really? I guess. Look at the top right.
[8881.06s -> 8888.23s]  Rebuild the beacons for money. Oh it's money. It's money. Oh I see.
[8892.18s -> 8899.45s]  Basically can never stop sprinting as Huntress. That was pretty sick.
[8908.73s -> 8914.55s]  Fieldbot finally got up to me. Nice. Are there i-frames on the dodge? Probably not. I don't know
[8914.55s -> 8925.38s]  why the hell I asked that. All right I got one. I'm helping. Okay. I got 388 bucks. What do they look
[8925.38s -> 8933.13s]  like? Uh they're like little staffs. Like little staves in the ground. I got two out of seven.
[8933.13s -> 8939.61s]  On the lunar coin. Do I get to keep that through death? Yes you do. Oh nice. You get to keep it
[8939.61s -> 8952.42s]  forever. That hurt. Uh I got another staff over here. Going for it. What is it? 270? 200? 300?
[8953.06s -> 8971.29s]  They're the purple in the top left. Oh nice. 278. 278. Okay there's three. They're just
[8971.29s -> 8985.34s]  I'm just gonna go along the outskirts and just activate them. Can we fall? I think you just fall
[8985.34s -> 9002.44s]  down there. All right. I got another one. We got four out of seven. Why do we have a boss? A boss
[9002.44s -> 9007.54s]  has just spawned. He's immune to everything. Immune. Immune. Immune. We have to turn off all these things
[9008.26s -> 9018.17s]  I think to be able to kill him. 297. All right I'm gonna activate this one. All right I'm activating
[9018.17s -> 9028.17s]  this one. Five. You got it? We need one. Okay easy. We need uh where is it? It's definitely on the
[9028.17s -> 9035.34s]  outskirts somewhere. Oh he's immune. Oh yeah I see. Yeah we can't. There's boxes down here too.
[9036.22s -> 9045.11s]  Maybe we should not activate this yet. Nice. Move faster. That's what I need right there.
[9045.11s -> 9050.81s]  Okay I'm moving. I'm running. He's too close to me. I don't like this. I'm out of combat right? I
[9050.81s -> 9056.68s]  should be going faster. Where is the uh the last staff? I don't know. Oh here it is. I don't have
[9056.68s -> 9063.72s]  enough money but it's right uh right there. How much money do you have? 139. What is it 270 right?
[9064.70s -> 9079.59s]  Yeah it's like 270. Oh no the rock just fucking no. That's gonna do a lot of damage to me. Hold on
[9079.59s -> 9089.05s]  I'm gonna do it. Come on. I'm gonna do it. Stupid rock. I need one penny. I did it. All right.
[9089.05s -> 9108.25s]  Defeat the boss. We're doing it. Oh god. Oh god. Oh there's like a giant dinosaur chasing behind me.
[9108.25s -> 9118.58s]  That's why I was hurting me. He's like just too far away from my little gold thing to matter.
[9118.58s -> 9132.25s]  That underwater shit is gonna drive me crazy. I'm dead. Oh the like crosshair sink underwater
[9132.25s -> 9166.92s]  thing. That thing just fucked me up bad. I don't even know what killed me. Oh just spawning more.
[9175.05s -> 9181.74s]  You need an insane build to handle this area huh? Well it's it seems kind of manageable. He's a
[9181.74s -> 9189.66s]  munigan? Rebuild the beacons. Oh oh my god. Just kill me. That's a joke. Never mind.
[9193.50s -> 9201.99s]  That's manageable. Apparently you missed a coin. Whatever. You go get the coin chat.
[9204.68s -> 9214.22s]  All right. Hold on. Give me one second. I need to change this. You want to get the coin? 1999 on
[9214.22s -> 9228.65s]  steam. Keybind. I'm this guy. Make it uh. You can be this guy too if you can. Let me test and see if
[9228.65s -> 9236.25s]  that works. I don't know who this guy is though. Okay ready? Hello. All right so just making sure
[9236.25s -> 9245.53s]  I can mute. Um we've done this yet? What's that? I'm surprised we haven't done the uh do the first
[9245.53s -> 9250.82s]  level three times thing or five times. I don't know. I got this guy. So you do have that guy.
[9250.82s -> 9258.57s]  How how can we both don't have it? Um I think I know why. What happened? Because I cheated.
[9258.57s -> 9264.78s]  You cheated? Yeah when I first got the game I have never played Risk of Rain so I did the only the
[9264.78s -> 9274.25s]  first area to see if I wanted to stream it. Oh okay. I am one ahead of you. I see. I got cheated.
[9275.26s -> 9282.18s]  You got cheated. I didn't even read this guy's abilities. Oh shit. That was kind of my fault
[9282.18s -> 9303.29s]  though. All right that was fun. 23 bucks for the chance. What do you got? Uh looks like there's
[9303.29s -> 9316.78s]  some decent boxes down here. Can't have been the freezer. Oh boy. That was all that was in those
[9316.78s -> 9327.96s]  two. This is this guy's crazy. Yeah good. And by crazy I mean I don't know how. What do you mean?
[9327.96s -> 9338.58s]  Manx Shrine of Chance. I love you. Like his movement is. Is it a good character? He's got wheels
[9340.65s -> 9344.89s]  and he dropped bombs and stuff. Move faster out of combat. I need more damage moves.
[9347.90s -> 9358.06s]  That's my alternate fire and then that's throwing the wee bombs. Uh rolling in. So wait can you
[9358.06s -> 9366.18s]  can use two? You're so cool. You look rob. I do look like rob. Apparently you can hold two active
[9366.18s -> 9374.47s]  items. Really? I might just be making that up. Is that true? I'm currently injecting myself with
[9374.47s -> 9381.69s]  attack speed which is the of course thing that this character needs. Spray and pray. You can.
[9381.69s -> 9390.71s]  That's cool. You're like grenades the way you throw my canisters up. Oh that's insane. Uh so I do this
[9392.20s -> 9396.44s]  then I can do this. Same same gun but alternate fire. Watch out behind you.
[9397.16s -> 9414.04s]  Whoops. Wow. As piercing too but you have to go so slow. Oh stunning. What's the weakness?
[9414.28s -> 9421.13s]  I feel like I'm so slow. You look pretty slow. You look like you're having looks like your wheels.
[9421.13s -> 9433.08s]  I also have a giant hitbox. I love how we're just kind of I'm kind of circling mindlessly around.
[9433.08s -> 9445.74s]  Yeah we probably should just like shooting these guys. Big hitbox. Okay shield. Uh it might be time
[9445.74s -> 9454.76s]  to get this going. Yeah it might be time. Where's the uh where's it over there? I'm struggling here.
[9454.76s -> 9459.61s]  Shit I want that. All right I'm gonna come remind me to go get that. He jumped over me.
[9461.26s -> 9466.46s]  There's two bots here. Do we know where the uh thing is yet? Not yet but I definitely want
[9466.46s -> 9476.33s]  to come back and get those. I assume you already went through here. Wrapped this way. I think I can
[9476.33s -> 9488.12s]  get one of them. Damn it. Did I miss it? I probably did. Yeah it's like right in the middle. All right
[9488.12s -> 9500.30s]  you got the stuff. You ready? I am pretty much ready but. All right it's a go. It's a go. I wanted
[9500.30s -> 9510.01s]  to get one of those heal bots. Stone titan. There's quite a few little stone friends over here.
[9513.99s -> 9523.46s]  Ow I could not dodge. I go so slow. Get away from me buddy. You can call me Wally not buddy.
[9524.02s -> 9534.23s]  Wally where are you stone titan? Back here. He's behind the pillar. He's just hiding. Yeah hiding.
[9534.23s -> 9541.06s]  He's line of sighting us. Oh that's fine. Keep doing that. I think I remember reading that they're
[9541.06s -> 9546.42s]  gonna make the teleporter easier to see because even though chat probably can see it without any
[9546.42s -> 9551.70s]  problem whatsoever uh they're gonna make it at least easier for streamers to see. I think that's
[9551.70s -> 9558.42s]  one of the first patch notes. For streamers? Yeah we've had some complaints that streamers can't see
[9558.42s -> 9570.31s]  it. Streamers are having trouble seeing it. I'm stuck on top of these guys. This is the uh streamer
[9570.31s -> 9583.11s]  update. I really do think they're changing that though. That's fine. Because like risk of rain one
[9583.11s -> 9589.26s]  you know you just go left or right. It's either left or right. Up or down. Where's the z-axis?
[9589.26s -> 9609.13s]  Doesn't exist. I have money to get my heal bot. Where the hell is my healing drone? There he is.
[9616.97s -> 9626.10s]  Almost dead. I don't know when to use oh my god. Good. When do you snipe mode or when not to?
[9626.10s -> 9630.66s]  We both. Ukuleles. We both can get it. I want to get another one of these. So what does that do?
[9630.66s -> 9639.78s]  Does it electrify shots or something? I believe that the ukulele does a spreading zap move.
[9642.23s -> 9653.78s]  Oran fruit. Heal. So it's just a heal. Cool. Probably pretty helpful. It's yeah it's a chain
[9653.78s -> 9668.20s]  lightning. I want that of the drone and then we can get out of here. There's a box down there too.
[9668.76s -> 9691.82s]  I'll get that on the way back. Let's see. Wasn't it over here? I'm just walked up the edge. Yeah
[9691.82s -> 9698.66s]  it's right here. Yeah I just uh I just turned him down. He was low and now he's he was high and
[9698.66s -> 9702.82s]  then he's I think he should be in a couple final boxes and things up here to spend money on. Sounds
[9702.82s -> 9712.18s]  better. We're gonna struggle with the next level though. There's one more box here. I need more of
[9712.18s -> 9720.04s]  these goat hooves. Cool cool. I got two drones. All right whenever you're ready. I'll be ready
[9720.04s -> 9729.40s]  in three two one. Can I will I die if I take infinite fall damage? Yeah I'm ready. Surprisingly
[9729.40s -> 9748.46s]  no. Send us to the next zone. We're on our way. Do I die if I take infinite damage? That's an
[9748.46s -> 9753.91s]  interesting question. Yeah we're getting some good stuff. What's the question? Uh no you said do I
[9753.91s -> 9758.79s]  die if I take fall infinite fall damage? Oh well because the robot doesn't have a teleport or
[9758.79s -> 9765.75s]  dodge roll. He just goes oh he just goes fast oh and then rams into things. So I was curious
[9765.75s -> 9773.05s]  since I don't have like a stop. We're going to make this a quick one because we're in medium
[9773.05s -> 9785.00s]  already. Yeah. Your moveset looks kind of cool though. It seems fun. It just it seems like
[9785.96s -> 9790.25s]  they overload you with HP because you're going to take tons of damage.
[9797.85s -> 9813.34s]  Ah my character has 560 HP right now. Let me go this way. 72. Another crowbar.
[9816.47s -> 9823.05s]  Oh a different teddy bear. Chance to block incoming damage. How much more do I have?
[9825.38s -> 9836.06s]  That jump is really generous. It jumps across the whole game. Come over there.
[9836.62s -> 9841.67s]  All right we've got to consider turning the portal on here. So if your healing drone dies
[9841.67s -> 9849.98s]  does it like recharge or does it like what happens? Probably not. I need 72 dollars.
[9852.71s -> 9864.95s]  That's really really good range. Will we get a raid coming? Who raided? No money. Where are the
[9864.95s -> 9871.29s]  enemies on this one? Drones just die when they're killed. Good to know. Got another coin. I got two
[9871.29s -> 9880.73s]  coins. Tomato? Tomato raid. What's going on tomato? Hope you had a good stream. I don't know what you
[9880.73s -> 9884.17s]  were doing but it was fucking awesome. So is it better to get the chests that are on the ground
[9884.17s -> 9890.23s]  that are the same price or the ones that have like the three tubes? You know what I mean?
[9890.23s -> 9898.76s]  Oh that's a good question. We both seem to give I think similar gear. The three tubes you choose
[9898.76s -> 9902.68s]  what you want. Oh I had just been walking up to them. Like it may as well be because right we
[9902.68s -> 9907.96s]  don't know what anything does anyway. Taleks and I are playing risk of rain 2. Depending on which side
[9907.96s -> 9912.41s]  you're on. Yeah we don't know what anything does anyways guys. We've not died once. We've never
[9912.41s -> 9925.34s]  played risk of rain 1. We haven't died one time yet so welcome. Now you ready to activate this thing?
[9925.98s -> 9930.78s]  Yeah I just can you ping me? Uh oh I thought you're just over there. Yeah I'm like at the
[9930.78s -> 9943.29s]  furthest end of the map possible. I didn't find it yet so. Oh well that does change things. Sorry
[9943.29s -> 9956.18s]  I was uh I got raided. Got raided by tomato. Sponsored by fruit. He came in swinging with all
[9956.18s -> 9964.87s]  of his fucking friends. Uh okay I should just give me something. Come on nothing twice in a row?
[9965.59s -> 9975.10s]  Three times in a row. Third time's the charm. There it is again. All right why are you linking
[9975.10s -> 9991.56s]  that clip? Of Cheeto? Why? What is that stupid item that sucks? So we don't know where the
[9991.56s -> 9997.85s]  teleporter is. Oh that's very interesting. They're really gonna make a streamer mode
[9998.49s -> 10007.35s]  so we can see it better. That's what I'm saying. Yeah I'm ready. I am for fully embrace the stream
[10007.43s -> 10014.82s]  mode. Yeah I got like a little uh helicopter buddy. I got a I got a lego set thing. All right well
[10014.82s -> 10019.85s]  whenever we find it. All right look at all right down I got I got I got it down here. Follow me
[10020.73s -> 10035.03s]  over there like behind that guy. Behind that guy. Yeah behind Tommy Pickles guy. It's here somewhere.
[10035.03s -> 10043.19s]  Oh yeah there is the orange right here on this strange platform. All right you ready? We're on
[10043.51s -> 10048.86s]  almost hard mode already. Almost yeah. Wait what are we looking for? Stone titan again.
[10055.40s -> 10068.57s]  Stone titan again. Anything a lot inside any small rocks? I'm just gonna stay here and do damage I
[10068.57s -> 10079.10s]  guess. Is this a big enough rock? I don't think so. What kind of a person cries about farts? You know
[10079.10s -> 10086.14s]  you have to be there. I can't I cannot defend that clip unless you were sitting here watching that
[10086.14s -> 10094.09s]  stream two days ago. Uh something I should know. It is no way I can explain it. Doesn't matter.
[10094.89s -> 10104.44s]  It's impossible. All right what do you drop? Uh I picked up a thing that I didn't know what it did.
[10105.08s -> 10110.20s]  I now have a titanic neural. Why not do it? This is this is actually going pretty well.
[10110.92s -> 10115.66s]  It's just a strangely fun word. It's an inside joke. It's not even an inside joke. I just
[10115.66s -> 10120.04s]  couldn't explain it. It would take about 30 to 40 minutes for me to explain what happened.
[10126.84s -> 10132.92s]  Try. I can't. You try. Call somebody into your room right now that's like at your house
[10132.92s -> 10141.93s]  and explain that to them. Okay. Hey. Derma. Come over here real quick. I gotta show you something.
[10141.93s -> 10148.06s]  Well I can't be on your webcam because I don't have any clothes on. Everybody thinks that's
[10148.06s -> 10155.88s]  bullshit. I don't have I don't have any I have no upper body clothes on. All right ready well
[10155.88s -> 10169.22s]  actually I got money. Bullshit. You got a hundred you got a hundred eighty four dollars.
[10170.47s -> 10176.10s]  Uh yep. Come over here. I'm gonna activate that. Like no activate like this thing.
[10176.74s -> 10179.54s]  Oh trying. Well I don't have a hundred and eighty four virtual dollars.
[10180.10s -> 10185.86s]  Oh you don't? I have a hundred and five. That's not enough. All right we got it. Let's go. We're
[10185.86s -> 10191.56s]  kind of just uh anymore boxes like right here. No hold on. Not yet. No yeah. I think I'll have
[10191.56s -> 10207.53s]  a hundred and eighty four in a second. All right. There it is. All right. What is that? What is
[10207.53s -> 10213.29s]  that little fireball? I spent a hundred and eighty four dollars to see it. Somebody said you're so
[10213.29s -> 10227.11s]  greedy. I'm a simple man. I cheat. Box I click it. Wait can I trade um what is this? I'm a simple
[10227.11s -> 10237.74s]  man. I'm a shwee. Oh it's actually not bad. All right. We gotta get out here. We have to get out
[10237.74s -> 10249.64s]  here. We really do. I'm teleporting away. Take us away. But he said it. He said the thing.
[10250.36s -> 10261.24s]  All right. What did he say? I said the s word. Right. It's it's a horrible square.
[10264.20s -> 10269.00s]  It breaks like Jeremy terms. It breaks German on eight five terms of service when you say it.
[10274.47s -> 10295.69s]  Um not sheet help. Let's find this thing quick so we can be ready for it. Do you see it? I have so
[10295.69s -> 10307.18s]  much health. It's insane. Anybody see it? Help the streamers out. We need streamer mode engaged.
[10307.18s -> 10326.82s]  I'm moving around 278 dollars. Oh here it is. It's there but we haven't got a single box. Is
[10326.82s -> 10332.33s]  that okay? But just be be ready for us if we can just get over there quick. It's taking me a long
[10332.33s -> 10339.21s]  time to kill anything. Yeah that's kind of what I'm also experiencing. How many bits for more
[10339.21s -> 10348.39s]  sheeto? I don't do that. Explain this thing that you keep saying. I I doesn't dude is no way.
[10349.27s -> 10354.23s]  You and I could sit downstairs and like like drink a bottle of whiskey over the course of like would
[10354.23s -> 10358.55s]  it require a bottle of whiskey? No but I'm saying like it would be like a let's have like a six hour
[10358.55s -> 10363.59s]  conversation and like hang out and like swirl around our fucking whiskies over ice. It'd take
[10363.59s -> 10384.18s]  that long. It's a long time. I know. Yeah I would have to give I would have to give you a swirly
[10384.18s -> 10410.28s]  before for you to understand. What a swirly. Yeah um that bolt that was kind of sad. What
[10410.28s -> 10416.71s]  just happened there? Okay getting blocked. All right are we activating this or no?
[10417.43s -> 10426.38s]  Um what is this? Get milky crystal? Sounds like a serial advertisement. Gain temporary flight.
[10428.06s -> 10437.30s]  Oh I dropped that. I feel like this just makes you more vulnerable to any attacks. You just have to
[10437.54s -> 10441.94s]  press. I'm activating. It's very hard. All right we're activating this. Wait wait wait wait wait
[10441.94s -> 10447.94s]  wait wait. Oh shit. I'm I'm at with my heel. Why did I even pick up a stupid fucking mosquito
[10447.94s -> 10476.66s]  wing? Seriously. Ow. Look at this. All right we gotta focus on one. Left or right? Extra damage
[10476.66s -> 10482.04s]  to bosses is in that 3d printer by the way. Yeah. Like right next to us. Oh I gotta move.
[10482.68s -> 10489.61s]  This is gonna be right in my face. These elites are ridiculous.
[10490.41s -> 10513.38s]  Where'd my missile launcher go? Somebody's shooting us from behind. No that's you. I think
[10513.38s -> 10520.55s]  you just shot me in the back like five times. Apologize now. That's for the swirly. I didn't
[10520.55s -> 10525.35s]  even give it to you yet. Dude I don't think I could even lift you up off the ground like upside down.
[10525.35s -> 10539.72s]  Oh my god. Is that a fat joke? Okay I'm getting sucked into the vortex. Is that a fat or a weak joke?
[10539.72s -> 10545.29s]  I'm dying. I'm taking that either way. Guys I don't know why I couldn't move.
[10546.01s -> 10555.93s]  Why did I fucking do anything? Why did I just get double sucked? Double sucked? I couldn't.
[10555.93s -> 10563.05s]  I there's nothing I could do. Dodge roll didn't do anything. I was just in it.
[10568.60s -> 10579.59s]  How do I use my tactical missiles again? I think I threw them away on accident. Good. Switch to real
[10579.59s -> 10586.50s]  gun. No that would require me to let go of the left mouse button. Yeah I got pulled I got too
[10586.50s -> 10600.49s]  tethered. No button did anything. It was just time for you to die. Grab your wings. Anything else
[10600.49s -> 10605.45s]  with my $1,300 I should get before going? You have to switch your weapon apparently.
[10606.78s -> 10616.06s]  Game's done on switch. Everyone likes the robot. Which shoots faster chat? That one
[10616.70s -> 10624.71s]  or this one? You know we're up against time with it right? I'm just curious. Do you want to
[10624.71s -> 10634.76s]  wear that? Is there like a taunty mode I can do? Like hold on. Shake my robot ass like that at the
[10634.76s -> 10640.20s]  camera while you spectate helplessly. Here we go. Mad because bad. Mad because bad. Mad because bad.
[10645.59s -> 10651.24s]  Passive aggressive streamer. You know what I like doing? I just want to make sure you're aware
[10651.24s -> 10657.66s]  there's a time limit. Do you know that? Oh we're on insane already. Yep this is gonna be it.
[10660.87s -> 10663.51s]  I didn't want I was gonna hold this back from you but I decided to tell you.
[10665.99s -> 10671.88s]  I picked up a second coin. I also have two coins. Well yeah how come you didn't tell me about the
[10671.88s -> 10678.38s]  second one? I did. I told you both times. Check the Vaughn. I'm gonna watch the whole Vaughn to
[10678.38s -> 10690.81s]  make sure. Insane and then after that is important. Imposter more like. Insane important and then
[10691.53s -> 10701.29s]  whatever comes out. All right I'm not touching like the dragon claw. I'm not convinced this does any
[10701.29s -> 10715.83s]  damage. Shrine of combat. No I ain't doing that. This is like a boss. Dodge rolling. This guy's
[10715.83s -> 10735.78s]  juking me around. He's acting like a flayer. Oh man this is gonna be rough. This is bad.
[10738.10s -> 10744.54s]  Touch it. Touch it. I'm not gonna. Guys look at how much we're struggling already here.
[10757.29s -> 10775.40s]  There's a giant dinosaur. There's like a monster rancher enemy over here. I'm gonna die. Jesus
[10775.40s -> 10796.41s]  leave me alone. I'm dead. I don't like this character. This character seems incredibly
[10796.41s -> 10812.68s]  vulnerable. Are you dead? Yeah oh yeah I died. Oh sorry. I took like 75 percent of my health in
[10812.68s -> 10818.30s]  the two tenths of a second. Oh well then let me just. What'd you do? What'd you do that for?
[10819.02s -> 10822.86s]  Because I didn't even get. I wasn't even close. I don't even know where the thing was. What about
[10822.86s -> 10837.83s]  our statistics? Game knows. Autosave. Well I unlocked the robot too. See autosave. Let me see.
[10839.34s -> 10850.15s]  That's too much. Too many words. I don't want to do it. Too many words to retool and rapidly
[10850.15s -> 10860.76s]  fire nails. Are we gonna do double robot? Um it'd be different. I mean we could do it. I haven't
[10860.76s -> 10869.05s]  been commando guy in a while. It's a stun canister. Basically you're uh gonna get yelled at for using
[10869.05s -> 10875.64s]  the wrong weapon so just get ready. That's all right. No matter what. That's fine. By me. I'm gonna
[10875.64s -> 10882.84s]  be the one yelling. Don't. You don't yell at me. I'm gonna. Switch to sniper. Am I okay? Am I crazy
[10882.92s -> 10889.34s]  or is the taskbar button for this game Planetside 2? Taskbar? Like on your taskbar.
[10893.58s -> 10898.62s]  Yeah it kind of is. It's the big number two with a font that I'm pretty sure that I downloaded from
[10898.62s -> 10906.15s]  dafont.com a long time ago. You didn't. All right let's see. Blast canister is a launch of stun
[10906.15s -> 10913.58s]  canister for 220 uh and then a weird symbol I don't recognize. It's like a bicycle. It's like
[10913.58s -> 10919.02s]  it's a top. It's a butterfly. Do you want me to unlock so you can read? 220 butterfly. Too late.
[10919.98s -> 10925.96s]  I don't know what that means but. We're going it. Yeah let's go. I'll figure it out.
[10929.54s -> 10943.82s]  I'm looking over here. Really? What? Nobody. Nobody liked that one. They all didn't like that.
[10944.54s -> 10952.70s]  Which one? I said something stupid. So this is now you can charge that. Okay.
[10954.04s -> 10957.40s]  You can actually just tap left click I found out. It feels like you have to hold it down though.
[10958.20s -> 10966.07s]  This is like the sprint around mode. So that's sprint around mode. This is the switch mode.
[10967.62s -> 10978.76s]  Double switch. Now where the hell's an enemy? This game's supposed to be hard. Where are the
[10978.76s -> 10998.60s]  enemies? Speed run. Where are the enemies though? Well I'm awful with this character.
[10999.77s -> 11003.05s]  Uh it's kind of difficult but you get a lot of health. Look at your health pool. Oh I do.
[11003.05s -> 11012.54s]  You're right. Uh spam right click basically and. Right click. Can I hold it? Okay I can.
[11015.78s -> 11025.78s]  It's like a stun bomb. Hey uh does anyone see the teleporter? That is pretty generous. I hope they
[11025.78s -> 11034.65s]  make them like a little bit easier to find in the future patch. Okay I got double shield.
[11035.45s -> 11046.22s]  Actually kind of fun to use this. It's one hit kill for a lot of enemies. Yeah it's like really
[11046.22s -> 11055.83s]  good at just chomping on chumps. And this is the how long does this last for? Do I cancel if I
[11055.83s -> 11065.66s]  jump? I do. Not even a fucking good game. Oops. Whoa. Um. I was waiting for you to come around.
[11065.66s -> 11073.26s]  We should probably. Activate. Activate. Yeah. It's just like a shitty run. This is like a wash run.
[11073.26s -> 11081.94s]  Not gonna you know what I mean? Yeah it's a reset. So what's better to use like this or this here?
[11081.94s -> 11099.40s]  Probably this. Uh this I think. Between the two. Like when the stupid stone guys get stuck
[11099.40s -> 11106.23s]  and they just sit there and jump in place on the trampoline. Now does holding it do anything else?
[11106.23s -> 11134.06s]  Or is it just kill? Oh hi. It's the boss. Oh dear. This is not a place I want to be.
[11134.86s -> 11138.70s]  Does it go through everybody? I think it does. Oh that's actually really good.
[11149.94s -> 11185.78s]  Oh another coin. All right the boss is dead. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We got to the. All right cool.
[11185.78s -> 11190.58s]  Red whip. All right we each get to move fast out of combat. That's a boss drop. I'm disappointed.
[11191.14s -> 11199.13s]  That's still all right. Boomer reference. You know you guys say that but.
[11200.10s -> 11212.04s]  You want to try the money machine? You laughed at it. Money machine. Oh yeah. Fruit. I'll save you a
[11212.04s -> 11224.81s]  box. Is there a box here? There's a box. Box. Right there. Why did that look like I was going slower?
[11225.45s -> 11229.51s]  I also busted the other money machine. Just for you.
[11233.83s -> 11241.19s]  The mask of inferno. I like prepped that for you. Yeah you like you sat at like the slot machine.
[11241.19s -> 11245.67s]  I sat at that machine. And spent like five grand and lost everything and I came over and put a
[11245.67s -> 11259.72s]  dollar in. Thanks. Hey. Let's go. Hey. You have money? I have 14 dollars. No I don't. Granny sniped
[11260.28s -> 11280.09s]  your slot. Yeah. Cool. You guys should be nice to your elders. Right off the bat. We've got a hurt
[11280.09s -> 11287.27s]  me machine. I'll take it. You can do it too. Oh thank you. What about over here? How much
[11287.27s -> 11293.83s]  gold did you get? I got 110. Which one of these do I want? Why did you get more money for losing
[11293.83s -> 11297.91s]  less health? Rapidly heal outside of danger. That's actually kind of good.
[11298.87s -> 11308.02s]  Oops. Oh he turns into a ghost. Right. Two luck. It feels like two luck sometimes.
[11308.66s -> 11318.23s]  Fuck it. No I'm not doing it again. Let's go nine luck. Ah yeah. Too bad it's a med kit.
[11318.95s -> 11328.01s]  So there's an initial burst on that isn't there? That's cool. That's why you should
[11328.01s -> 11340.70s]  switch between them. On the right click? Yeah for the robot. Okay. Oops. I keep thinking that's
[11340.70s -> 11355.10s]  right click for some reason. Got some money? Wait people are saying they can't see squad mode
[11355.10s -> 11359.42s]  because it's not working. Has it not been on the whole time and nobody said anything? It says it's
[11359.42s -> 11367.66s]  on. Yeah it says it's on. It says my squad. It says my squad. Maybe twitch just fucking it's a
[11367.66s -> 11374.07s]  new feature and they're just like fuck we don't know what to do about this. Here I'm gonna leave
[11375.53s -> 11383.45s]  and then. Squad mate. Whoops I just invited someone else. Hold on. Dude come on bring him in.
[11384.17s -> 11393.54s]  Invite him to the squad. Okay there we go. I just sent you the invite. All right well hold on.
[11396.98s -> 11402.65s]  We can refresh. You're gonna have to protect me over here because I need the light. Um not even
[11402.65s -> 11415.74s]  close. Uh let me see. My squad. Uh I don't see anything. Let's see. Except we're in a squad.
[11416.54s -> 11430.70s]  We're in the squad. Apparently we're in a squad. Timing on that. All right does it work now?
[11432.04s -> 11438.17s]  Uh I don't think so. I don't know what people are saying. I don't see. What are people saying?
[11438.97s -> 11446.23s]  Nothing. Nothing. It's pretty simple on our side because there's literally you type in the name.
[11446.23s -> 11452.18s]  Send an invitation. They accept and that's supposed to be it. Well it doesn't seem to be doing its
[11452.18s -> 11464.54s]  intended function. All right what is the uh any sign of the thing? The squad button is kind of
[11464.54s -> 11471.45s]  hard to see to be honest when it does work. It's like above the stream and to the right.
[11471.45s -> 11477.05s]  No we don't even need to be in a squad. We're like we're our squad in game. Everyone knows us as the
[11477.05s -> 11492.31s]  squad. You are taking way too many of these nails. I need a box please. Yeah I need like uh
[11492.31s -> 11505.30s]  something to spend on. Nothing. Come on. Come on. Really? I can hear you losing out across the map.
[11505.30s -> 11528.79s]  Yeah I did. I'll be able to do it one more time here. Then we got to activate this. One fifteen
[11528.79s -> 11540.52s]  was it? Do you know where the uh teleporters? That's over here I think. Oh shit I can't do
[11540.52s -> 11550.92s]  it anymore. Oh did you take this one? Oh you did. I did. I sniped it. What about is there
[11550.92s -> 11553.96s]  another box or something? All right we gotta find the thing. We're gonna find teleporter.
[11554.52s -> 11591.42s]  I'm just gonna go speed mode. Well um see it over here. Go that way. Yeah okay. I'm just gonna head
[11591.42s -> 11599.99s]  there. I think we're ready. You good? Ready to give this try? Yeah I'm just popping this last uh
[11599.99s -> 11620.07s]  money machine. I'm ready. I'm ready. Wait how do I cycle my active? Oh I get it. Okay that makes
[11620.07s -> 11647.00s]  sense. That's not just cycling my cannon. That's cycling everything. Excuse me. I missed my super
[11647.00s -> 11658.18s]  boss damage. Ow. I'm getting killed by these like bells. I have a lot of health. This thing. I was
[11658.18s -> 11667.19s]  scared. I was gonna just tank most. I'm the one gonna die. I'm coming to you. There are a lot of
[11667.19s -> 11683.56s]  these. Oh there's a lot of bells. Oh my god. I'm gonna take the bells out from afar. Boss is almost
[11683.56s -> 11710.89s]  dead. Oh jeez. Oh boy. Oh jeez. There's so many bells. Boss is dead. Boss is down. Nice. This is
[11710.89s -> 11719.80s]  really a million of these things. We've never seen anything like this before. Uh oh. Because we're
[11719.80s -> 11726.28s]  almost on hard on the second level. We took too long I guess. We took too long. Teleport is ready
[11726.28s -> 11733.96s]  though. It's the name of the game. We took too long. Yeah that is the title. I don't think
[11733.96s -> 11737.66s]  there's anything else to spend money on. Is there nothing else to spend money on? I don't know. I
[11737.66s -> 11744.33s]  don't see anything. Maybe we gotta we gotta yeah we gotta just get out of here. Might as well take
[11744.33s -> 11751.42s]  us out. No you take us out. Uh you take us out. No you take us out. And you take you you had play
[11751.42s -> 11760.07s]  us on out of here. All right I'll get I'll get I got I got I got I got I got it. We both did it.
[11760.07s -> 11777.61s]  We both pressed it together. Good job. Okay cool. Uh do you want should I get a drumstick or what?
[11779.03s -> 11793.16s]  No. You know I pushed the squad button. See if it works. Come on. There was a hidden button.
[11793.72s -> 11798.12s]  What are you talking about with the squad? You have to like actually it's not enough that we're both
[11798.12s -> 11805.02s]  live and that we do the invitation but we also there's you have to like initiate it. What? It's
[11805.02s -> 11817.51s]  active. So chatters unite. Only took three hours but you know what better late than never.
[11818.23s -> 11828.98s]  Name of the game. What's the name of the game Shad? Took too long. All right here we go.
[11828.98s -> 11845.64s]  Uh we got we have to activate this **** like now. We're in hard. I hate these time boxes that really
[11845.64s -> 11860.01s]  are like you're too slow. Sorry you can't open this. There's a mega skull back there. There's so
[11860.01s -> 11871.46s]  many shrines and no boxes. All right I got money. I'm going this way. Rapidly heal outside. I feel
[11871.46s -> 11876.02s]  like I just want to go. I need some of these. If you see an equipment box could you let me know
[11876.02s -> 11881.30s]  because I have a thing that lets me double charge any equipment but I haven't found any.
[11882.02s -> 11895.19s]  I'm just gonna find the teleporter. Hey there's one. It's too bad it's temporary flight again.
[11897.78s -> 11909.29s]  I'm gonna say it's over here. What is going on? This is one guy from that far away really just
[11909.29s -> 11921.99s]  do all that ****. All right it's right here. It looks like you see the smoke. The smoke?
[11926.12s -> 11934.20s]  It's the boss one right? Yeah I see it. It's up there. It's right there.
[11934.84s -> 11947.96s]  There's a little. Oh this thing costs one lunar. Is that worth it? Is it worth it for a coin for a
[11947.96s -> 11953.88s]  coin of the order? I don't know considering we've been here for a while. This this run might stop
[11953.88s -> 11964.50s]  at the next stop. No that is a meme. Okay that's kind of mean. It's a save. Don't do it. Okay do
[11964.50s -> 11969.08s]  we know where the oh it's over here. Yeah it's right. You're right. It's on me. We're gonna lose.
[11969.08s -> 11973.80s]  I mean I don't have any offensive capability whatsoever. Oh my god these guys are unbearable.
[11974.68s -> 11981.38s]  Let me help. It's this thing. Okay we did we got this exact same thing at the same level
[11981.38s -> 11986.74s]  already. We had to do this **** already on the cliff here too. Oh boy. Oh god.
[11987.94s -> 11994.82s]  This is where we died last time. Yeah I'm getting the hell out of here. Try and stay inside the red.
[11994.82s -> 12009.06s]  I'm gonna try. No guarantees. Stupid temporary flying nonsense. Oh my god no way.
[12012.50s -> 12023.93s]  This is nuts. Goodbye. Yep I'm dying. I'm dead. They can shoot through the bottom of that rafter
[12023.93s -> 12032.97s]  which is kind of stupid. You take damage. I'm so slow. I'm gonna get just collapsed on here.
[12033.85s -> 12061.29s]  I don't know if I'll be able to kill this thing. I will try. Oh my lord no way. I can only turn
[12061.29s -> 12072.28s]  into a box so many times. Oh you've only got to do 22,000 more HP damage. That's not very much.
[12073.32s -> 12078.04s]  No like each shot does 198. So somebody just map that out real quick. What the hell is this
[12078.04s -> 12084.47s]  thing doing up here? We'll find out how many basic shots you need. This is a cut. Okay where's the
[12084.47s -> 12096.09s]  boss? I'm just gonna try to get the no more spawning. Oh they're over there.
[12101.02s -> 12119.13s]  Oh that's probably it. That's it. That's it. You tried. You tried. I did. I really did try.
[12119.93s -> 12127.11s]  I'm gonna go back to uh go back to hunters. All right I'm gonna go back to multi the multi
[12127.11s -> 12136.66s]  tool. Can I pee? Yeah you want to take a pee break? Pee break would be good. Pee break. Time to pee.
[12139.61s -> 12140.57s]  Co-op pee break.
[12145.29s -> 12376.65s]  We'll be right back. Squad pee. I'm gonna refill my drink. I'm not back yet. Refill. All right
[12383.37s -> 12410.49s]  we are back. Sort of. Uh soda. Where are my ads? No ads. But uh tomorrow we're gonna we're not done.
[12410.49s -> 12415.45s]  We're gonna keep playing but just to let everybody know. Tomorrow is the scratch ticket stream
[12416.39s -> 12423.18s]  and the germa slots stream. If you didn't catch that from the last couple streams
[12423.74s -> 12448.50s]  should be fun. Let's try this again. You back? I don't think he's back. Let me take a look over here.
[12448.50s -> 12470.55s]  Uh let's try you again. Heart effects coming soon. Hey hey Midas was having some technical
[12470.55s -> 12487.75s]  difficulties. Midas was having technical difficulties. All right let's try this again.
[12487.75s -> 12488.95s]  You gave him a swirly.
[12498.20s -> 12512.09s]  Titanic Plains. Let's go. All right fast. I'm not being fast. This is a new have we done this first?
[12512.65s -> 12525.10s]  I feel like we've done that same uh area first every time. Well that hurt. Oh hi hide in the egg.
[12525.10s -> 12531.13s]  What happens if you never leave? Can you take damage in the egg? You just stay in the pod.
[12531.13s -> 12544.02s]  Yeah if you stay in the pod till ha ha ha. What happens? Maybe an achievement. You just win.
[12544.02s -> 12554.90s]  All right I prayed to the mountain. This is level one on easy. We can go for it. 40 bucks
[12554.90s -> 12574.18s]  couple of canisters down there. Give me something. This is huge. Oh that's new. Turn invisible when
[12574.18s -> 12584.73s]  you take heavy damage. Two in a row baby. Nice. I got the ukulele from a luck shrine. That's good.
[12584.73s -> 12597.93s]  That's good to start with definitely. That's pretty sweet. Okay 54. Give me some long range
[12597.93s -> 12606.44s]  supporting fire. It's a healing drone. Give me. Those things are very useful. Look at his little
[12606.44s -> 12615.85s]  shield. All right hold on. I need to give Midas his treat. Yeah Midas. All right there's a ton
[12615.85s -> 12625.94s]  of boxes over here. Where are the enemies? Where are the enemies? I believe they are flying in the
[12625.94s -> 12636.02s]  sky. There's two of them. Three boxes over here. Yep. Like you said. Yeah there's just no way to
[12636.02s -> 12650.25s]  get money. There we go. Faster attack speed. Nice. Give me that like three or four times. Yeah I
[12650.25s -> 12659.13s]  think faster attack speed would be a game saver. Keep right clicking for some reason. We might
[12659.13s -> 12664.95s]  consider turning it on. Do we know where it is right here? No but we gotta go looking for it.
[12665.91s -> 12675.99s]  It should be. I see it. It's over here. Thank you SIG for the uh SIG Buur for the five community subs.
[12676.63s -> 12687.91s]  Thank you. Thank you SIG. Appreciate it. Dropping five subs. Attack speed is awesome. Oh by the way
[12687.91s -> 12693.86s]  I activated the mountain thing. I did. I was standing right next to you. What I activated the
[12693.86s -> 12699.06s]  mountain thing? Oh I thought you meant activated the. No we got the uh we got two of them because
[12699.06s -> 12719.16s]  of that. Extra rewards. It was worth it. This piercing? Wow. Oh that hurt. Yeah these fire
[12719.16s -> 12735.02s]  enemies gotta go. Oh oh oh this is going so well until about five seconds ago. Geez. Heal me bot.
[12735.02s -> 12762.02s]  How are we doing? We're okay. Back? Okay. Whoops. Oh god. I'm so sorry. I got cocky. Sorry. I'm
[12762.02s -> 12777.69s]  really cocky. All right I guess I get the one on the right. One with less health. One down. We're
[12777.69s -> 12783.75s]  gonna get four items aren't we? Uh I don't know. Do you get I guess you should get something for
[12783.75s -> 12787.27s]  beating the uh the mountain challenge right? Yeah you just do but we'll just double it up.
[12788.81s -> 12798.90s]  I don't know. There it is. Yeah there's four. We're gonna do rock paper scissors over who gets
[12798.90s -> 12804.10s]  the yellow. Well the yellow is just the beetle so it's beneficial to both of us. Um hold an
[12804.10s -> 12810.55s]  additional equipment charge. That's really good. Do you have an equipment? Because I don't. I do
[12810.55s -> 12819.72s]  not but well uh you grab the beetle then. You have like the buddy because you're slower so it looks
[12819.72s -> 12830.71s]  I am very slow. It's nice to have some backup. All right now we look for boxes. Coin? Where's the coin?
[12830.71s -> 12835.67s]  Oh there's a coin right there. Yeah there was a coin. How many do you have? I have two. All right.
[12835.67s -> 12839.67s]  All right ready? You got it. Rock paper scissors shoot. What'd you put on? I have three. Oh you can
[12839.75s -> 12846.98s]  have it. Thanks I would. Thanks I win. All right anything else? I see a couple of things right
[12846.98s -> 12858.17s]  here isn't active. All right I got three charges of the cube. That's pretty good. Is there a box
[12858.17s -> 12870.12s]  back here? Wasting time. And this is actually really good. Yeah we should probably just get
[12870.12s -> 12875.56s]  out of here then. Oops I forgot to look in the different. I didn't know what bustling fungus was
[12875.56s -> 12884.23s]  anyways. Now I know. Never pick the fungus. Cube. Uh any more boxes over by you that are not open?
[12884.23s -> 12892.98s]  Um not that I see yet. I don't see any either. It's good for a special build. Ooh there's one
[12892.98s -> 12899.94s]  more box up here that I'm going to get. Grab it because we're about to be medium. Going as fast
[12899.94s -> 12915.96s]  as my little wheels will carry me. Let's go boss damage. Ready? Yep. One two three go. He's grabbing
[12915.96s -> 12935.93s]  me. Cube is the best item in the game is it? Let's make this quick. 100. Turrets are not the station
[12935.93s -> 12940.09s]  the stationary turrets are really not that great because they just stay in the same spot and they
[12940.09s -> 12948.78s]  don't come with you. The healing ones and the little floaty guys they do. I guess maybe in some
[12948.78s -> 12962.41s]  scenarios it's not a bad idea. Is there no key item anymore? Was there you had to get a key in
[12962.41s -> 12976.94s]  the first one? I guess. How much does this cost? 72 dollars. Well I can't believe they're charging
[12976.94s -> 12992.15s]  that for an early access game. 72 again. Outrageous. All right 71 72. I'm taking it. I'm gonna take it.
[12996.50s -> 13007.22s]  That's good. There's another box here for 72. Another one there. Boss damage. I'm gonna go this way. I love my little
[13007.22s -> 13019.34s]  shield on my rope it. Nice sight there. Um praying to the shrine of the mountain. Oh god you're bold
[13021.14s -> 13036.38s]  Very bold. Go big or go home. 116. 72. Yeah. I want to go up there and get the money machine.
[13037.26s -> 13060.94s]  Sticky bomb. Oops I missed that one. That was a misclick. Got more boss damage. Any sights on the
[13060.94s -> 13077.58s]  thing? Uh I see orange. I see orange. It's like in this area. Here it is. Uh you ready? Um I guess.
[13078.30s -> 13084.26s]  I need to give you some boxes. I've had I got some. I'm uh kind of far away. It seems like I have a lot more items.
[13085.58s -> 13094.22s]  Um you kind of do but that's all good. Um I'm gonna activate this. I got 140 bucks now. I think
[13094.22s -> 13101.78s]  there's another box over here. Right. Where's there where's there a box? I got money. I'm saying right
[13101.78s -> 13111.32s]  on the thing when you're ready. I need one box. Ah just do it. All right it's gonna be the super
[13111.32s -> 13119.11s]  one so good luck. Yep. Stone two stone titans. Oh that's gonna be that's gonna be nutty.
[13122.28s -> 13128.65s]  I should do really good boss damage though. I should. Whoa where's the other one? Did we even
[13128.65s -> 13134.14s]  get another one? Yeah he's up on the rocks left there. Let's try to kill the one on the bottom
[13134.14s -> 13159.50s]  first. See if we can just get rid of him. He's like stuck. Geb just deflected my own. We'll get him.
[13159.50s -> 13175.77s]  He's going down. Dead. All right one down. Now the one's up top right? Yep. Well I can't. That's
[13175.77s -> 13183.98s]  oh okay there's already boss loot. So I picked up one. There's more though. I almost just steam
[13183.98s -> 13190.76s]  rolled over all the boss loot. Well at least somebody would. I was in my speed mode. I'm
[13190.76s -> 13203.00s]  getting hit. We get it. That's double. We got double loot twice. Yep. That means we should do
[13203.00s -> 13207.08s]  fairly decent this time. All right I think they're all the same so I'm just gonna take two and you
[13207.08s -> 13213.99s]  can have the other two. It's invisibility on heavy damage. Okay so how heavy does it have to be?
[13214.71s -> 13219.51s]  I don't know. It seems fairly generous. Well for you to stack it I mean. Does it make the attacks
[13219.51s -> 13230.87s]  lighter? All right we got money. Let's move to pick up some stuff. Yeah. It's generous. It is. Okay
[13230.87s -> 13239.19s]  that's good. Come on give me something. There was another shrine to the mountain. Oh there were two.
[13241.82s -> 13250.07s]  It's technically random damage. That's weird. Yeah I found the secret box stash up here.
[13250.71s -> 13267.26s]  Is this a box? Yes it is. More sticky bombs. Drop healing orb. Good. This is a luck shrine. What is this?
[13269.58s -> 13277.18s]  Nice. So um when you get a war banner again does it just make the war banner even better?
[13278.89s -> 13287.61s]  Probably. It was a 137 dollar uh luck shrine that I primed for you if you wanted. Where is it? 137.
[13287.61s -> 13295.72s]  I marked it. Dude I have. I failed twice in a row. I have so many drones. I have one two three four
[13295.72s -> 13307.98s]  five like five drones. All right I'm coming to you for it. Three healing drones and two gunner drones.
[13310.98s -> 13322.22s]  Nothing. All right I'm going. Yeah activate it. Yep. Going home. Oh there's a blood shrine up there too.
[13322.22s -> 13328.79s]  Can I get it before we go? Nope. Don't even need it. I got it. No I didn't. Shit.
[13331.19s -> 13352.78s]  Damn it. All right let's move. Look at the money. Quick money. 120. Get the timed box. Is it oh
[13352.78s -> 13357.83s]  it's a timed box. We have like we have like 40 seconds to get it. Where is it? Where is it? I
[13357.83s -> 13363.88s]  don't know. It's in like a. Is it over here? I think I saw it here before. How many seconds?
[13364.76s -> 13371.56s]  Is it too late? No it's minus 4 30 for this time box. Oh. We're uh it has to be 10 minutes.
[13372.36s -> 13381.21s]  Oh we were close. Somebody said it sucks anyways. No. I don't know if that's true. Maybe they just
[13381.21s -> 13387.35s]  said that to make us feel better. Maybe. Somebody said I thought it was 15 for co-op but apparently
[13387.35s -> 13405.91s]  not I guess. And all right it's more healing outside of danger. What is this? This the luck one?
[13405.91s -> 13411.43s]  No that's the other shrine thing. I'm gonna go look for it just so we can know where it is
[13411.43s -> 13430.62s]  because we're only on hard. This is not terrible. Look at all my little buddies flying in. You're
[13430.62s -> 13460.18s]  annoying. Die. Bleed damage or super banner three. These crits are insane when they hit. They hit
[13460.18s -> 13466.02s]  pretty frequently. Lots of money too. All right money. What is this? Reactivate fan.
[13467.03s -> 13476.30s]  Oh rapidly heal outside danger. That's a pretty good amount of shit over here.
[13477.53s -> 13493.56s]  242. Oh faster. I want some more damage. I have a lot of weird utility upgrades.
[13494.89s -> 13497.45s]  Oh I'll go this way. Another large blocks up here right.
[13499.99s -> 13512.26s]  Oops that should be enough to get something. Oh glasses. New reactivity fan again. I've got
[13512.26s -> 13518.65s]  rid of mushrooms for glasses. That's pretty odd. Hey there's a glass. I'm just gonna get
[13518.65s -> 13525.03s]  rid of everything for glasses. Can I do that over and over again? I don't know.
[13529.03s -> 13537.14s]  There goes the knife. Thought I could get him. There goes I don't know what that is.
[13537.86s -> 13543.99s]  Probably should go up. All right four pairs of sunglasses. You have four pairs of sunglasses.
[13543.99s -> 13552.15s]  Ten glasses 100% crit. So what you're at like 40% chance to crit? Yeah I'm at 50% right now.
[13552.15s -> 13557.99s]  I'm going to I'm going for 100% crit chance. I'm just getting rid of everything. Oh my god. All
[13557.99s -> 13564.46s]  right. You have to experiment. It's the glass's chest. Duplicate the same item seven times in a
[13564.46s -> 13573.10s]  row. All right that should be all of them right. Is this bugged? Yeah come on. That's bullshit.
[13573.74s -> 13580.74s]  There goes my banner. 150 gold to do it again. All right I have 10. So you have a you have a
[13580.74s -> 13587.86s]  100 chance to crit. That's correct. Well hopefully we can see the end of the game. No
[13588.66s -> 13601.29s]  that'd be nice. I don't know which is faster damage or not. Come on. I got it good. No I
[13601.29s -> 13609.29s]  have so many slugs. 100% unstoppable crit. I can only just die. I don't know what I had to give up
[13609.29s -> 13614.09s]  to get to this point. I have so many. How many slugs do I have? All right where's the stupid
[13614.09s -> 13633.06s]  thing? It's time. It is time. I don't see any up there that way. I got streamer eyes. I could see
[13633.06s -> 13649.21s]  it. Did you get the patch already? Yep. Oh I can die once. I'm allowed to die. Yeah it's up here.
[13653.85s -> 13661.13s]  Extra jump. Very nice. Up here. Oh got it. You want to turn it on? Get ready to go. Hold on I
[13661.13s -> 13670.10s]  got to come to you. Now if you can find harvester you heal every time you crit. That seems the same.
[13670.10s -> 13681.35s]  No that would be really good. There we go. All right I'm ready. One two three. Who is it? It's
[13681.35s -> 13694.06s]  the imp overlord. Imp overlord 20 000 health. Eat this. Just spam it all out there. Just eat it.
[13694.70s -> 13706.79s]  I don't know does that damage stack? I have a lot of like tingly crit noises going on. Tingly crit
[13706.79s -> 13716.68s]  sound. It's like it's like a sleet. It's like hail lightly falling on your tin roof. It looks really
[13716.68s -> 13720.12s]  cool. Look at the look at his health bar. Look at his health bar. Yeah you're just melting him.
[13721.08s -> 13742.95s]  Holy shit. He's dead. Well that's one way to do it. Whoa I almost just ran into that. We have a lot
[13742.95s -> 13754.04s]  of money though. I left the boss item for you. Thank you. That is yours. Okay uh we have we've
[13754.04s -> 13763.03s]  got a lot of money. I didn't see any boxes though. No you don't? No boxes? Really? Um just this one
[13763.03s -> 13769.11s]  right here. Literally just this one. Ah just grab it. I'm gonna just check down here one more time.
[13769.11s -> 13773.99s]  I gotta wait until we teleport charge because otherwise we'll never be able to pick them up.
[13775.11s -> 13781.69s]  Wait does my lightning crit too for the ukulele? That's a fan. I'll stay here in charge while you
[13781.69s -> 13796.65s]  search. There's a canister here. Nothing. There's a timed one. Uh yeah I got one here. What is it
[13796.65s -> 13807.50s]  what we want? This one. More boss damage. What else? Anything else? What about inside here?
[13807.50s -> 13825.51s]  I gotta increase attack speed. Oh are you? Not yet. Hold on. Okay I got a crit chance.
[13826.31s -> 13833.93s]  There's like one no. Double crowbars. So oh wait that's gonna stack. Deal more damage to healthy
[13833.93s -> 13843.96s]  enemies with super crit is gonna stack for sure. I got the gamer glasses now. Whoops. So now me go
[13843.96s -> 13852.18s]  get 10 glasses? Wait can I use that machine that you were using? You can but you have to give up.
[13853.14s -> 13859.35s]  Random stuff. Well. So it could ruin your build potentially. I mean my build I don't really have
[13859.35s -> 13872.36s]  one. How many do I have right now? All right he's like a sticky bomb. So I have like sticky bombs.
[13872.36s -> 13879.40s]  Let's do it. Let's be let's be the crit brothers. Crit brothers. Super lens glasses. How many do you
[13879.40s -> 13894.60s]  need? Ten for a hundred. Yeah get rid of the slugs. All right I'm at 60 percent. 70 percent.
[13897.88s -> 13905.02s]  Oh I lost a pretty good item. Well might as well just go. Oh my god I lost two of them. All right.
[13906.06s -> 13910.38s]  Uh oh. Was it worth it? It's not worth it but with both 100 percent crit.
[13911.10s -> 13917.02s]  Let's go. What'd you lose? Uh everything. Everything. You have to say it dramatically.
[13917.58s -> 13927.98s]  Everything. All right get us out of here. I lost uh two boss damage things and I lost some really
[13928.86s -> 13935.34s]  Is it possible to get 11 of an item? 110 percent crit. That's kind of how would that work?
[13936.52s -> 13940.89s]  You ready? Somebody said that's yeah there's the reference for this stream.
[13943.96s -> 13952.23s]  True ride or die. All crit all the time. Yeah let's see. Okay let's just not get popped here.
[13952.23s -> 13957.27s]  Just don't instantly die. 121 damage a hit. Oh holy shit this is actually pretty ridiculous.
[13958.79s -> 13965.80s]  Uh we should do fairly well. We should yeah I mean you have auto aim and auto crit so like
[13966.52s -> 13984.15s]  all you have to do is sprint. In theory. I don't have enough money here. This dinosaur used to be
[13984.15s -> 14006.92s]  so obnoxious now. All right 157 225. Let's get it. Stupid fucking heal. Extra damage to bosses.
[14006.92s -> 14013.08s]  That's what you want. Oh I thought your guy was a bad guy. Yeah I did the same thing all the time.
[14014.20s -> 14020.36s]  Another stupid healing slug. Two in a row. Oh I uh see the dust. If you want to rush before we
[14020.36s -> 14028.58s]  get to impossible. Uh we probably should. I mean at this point we're almost at impossible.
[14029.22s -> 14039.88s]  What do we need to activate this? 150. 150. All right uh you ready? Uh yeah might as well just do
[14039.88s -> 14063.45s]  it. All right crit. It is the stone titan. He does do a lot of damage. He does do a lot but if we
[14063.45s -> 14070.78s]  all DPS him it should be fine. There's other people fucking flying around here too. No bad.
[14070.78s -> 14091.34s]  Very bad. Very bad. I gotta get out. All right one's dead. Need these heal bots. Holy shit. Melt
[14091.34s -> 14108.86s]  them. Melt them. Your turn. I need a breather. There's so much going on. It's like a rate. Like
[14108.86s -> 14125.22s]  an wow rate. Oh fuck man. He's spamming that at me. He's dead. Oh wow nice. I'm almost dead.
[14127.08s -> 14134.55s]  Thank you heal bots for keeping me alive. How many do you have? Uh I think they're yours. I think
[14134.55s -> 14140.14s]  they're like I got hours. I have three. They're very very helpful. All three of them can heal me
[14140.14s -> 14153.80s]  as well as you. Do the heals crit? That'd be cool. What are we at? 87. All right now we got money.
[14153.80s -> 14157.88s]  We just went right through this man. No enemies. So we can spend some time here after this.
[14157.88s -> 14167.64s]  That was a good idea. Yeah. All right left uh your boss item and we each have like 1600 bucks.
[14167.64s -> 14179.03s]  Okay boss item is what is it? Another fuel cell god. All right what do we want to buy?
[14180.47s -> 14185.67s]  I don't know. It's like being a kid at the toy store. The whole map is available.
[14186.39s -> 14194.04s]  Okay more damage to health. Four rose bucklers right now. Does a missile drone follow you or is
[14194.04s -> 14199.96s]  it stationary? Like is it worth picking this up for the future or? Um I don't know. I know
[14199.96s -> 14206.97s]  the gunner follows you. I assume it follows you. Damn it. So we'll get another drone. I'll spend
[14206.97s -> 14221.14s]  my money on a stun grenade. A co-op. Damn it. Damn it. Yeah only the turrets follow okay.
[14223.24s -> 14229.16s]  Sunk cost fallacy. I know. I know. What is the sun? I lost all my money gambling.
[14229.64s -> 14236.50s]  Okay it's gone. You have 400. No well. Wait hold on. I might be able to whoops. Come on.
[14237.54s -> 14247.85s]  Come on. 176. 180. There's so many. I'm so stupid. Why did I gamble? I shouldn't have gambled. I
[14247.85s -> 14253.48s]  should not have done that. How much is it to gamble more? Like 500 something dollars. I need
[14253.48s -> 14261.30s]  there's like two. This two boxes right here like in between there. It makes you feel better. I
[14261.30s -> 14266.42s]  gambled and won on the first try. Yeah because I'm the old person that sat down and spent like
[14266.42s -> 14270.34s]  five thousand dollars here. The five hundred dollar one. That was at the one hundred and fifty dollar
[14270.34s -> 14282.60s]  one. None of these I can. 450. One lunar coin. These minimums are too high. All right I'm ready.
[14282.60s -> 14287.61s]  We got to go to some different tables. There's so many boxes here that I could have opened at
[14287.61s -> 14297.05s]  least two or three more boxes. I'm so upset with myself. What's this blue portal? I can win it back
[14297.05s -> 14307.10s]  just you wait. Do you hit the blue portal or the teleporter chat? Blue portal. Stay alive for 30
[14307.10s -> 14313.61s]  minutes. Blue portal. The portal goes to a shop world. We just spent all of our money. What?
[14314.17s -> 14322.02s]  Let's go to the shop world and at least see the new stuff. I have a hundred. Well we don't have
[14322.02s -> 14330.73s]  any money. Do not do blue yet. Somebody just said in all caps. Well we're not. We don't have to buy
[14330.73s -> 14334.81s]  anything here. We can look. I just fell down. What's happening? I fell off the fucking mountain. What
[14334.81s -> 14342.79s]  happened? Hello? Hi. You okay down there? I don't know. I just went off. Do I have to go down? Am I
[14342.79s -> 14350.02s]  never gonna be able to come back up? I don't know. They didn't think about that when they made this
[14350.02s -> 14355.22s]  game 3D apparently. They're like what if somebody falls? Well it just like spawned me and I just
[14355.22s -> 14361.00s]  moved for a second. Well you can like can you die and I you can just spectate me because there's a
[14361.00s -> 14365.48s]  bunch of stuff people in chat do not want me to buy that cost lunar coins. Okay I technically
[14365.48s -> 14376.70s]  should have probably. Where am I now? Okay. Reforge items. I'm back so we can forge. Where to fight
[14376.70s -> 14383.08s]  this guy? Hold on is this the character? He has a health bar. Is this the character in the ice right
[14383.08s -> 14387.59s]  here with the 10 lunar coins? I think you have to have 10 lunar to unlock this character. This
[14387.59s -> 14394.73s]  character? Yeah on the right. He's right where he says 10 lunar and he's in a block of ice.
[14394.73s -> 14403.40s]  What about the dragon? The dragon is like he's selling him. He's like the slaver. Reforge five
[14403.40s -> 14411.82s]  items. Dare you. No why would I do that? Look is it still counting? Why is it counting in the shop?
[14411.82s -> 14416.22s]  Uh oh I'm coming for you. This shouldn't be counting in the shop. Time should freeze. The whole
[14416.22s -> 14426.01s]  game is time. This is one big stopwatch. No I can't. I was gonna do one shot and then run.
[14426.01s -> 14436.38s]  All right we're going back. This is all too too confusing for us at the moment. We apparently
[14436.38s -> 14440.30s]  it's bad to buy anything with lunar coins until you get this lunar character.
[14440.30s -> 14443.10s]  So we shouldn't buy anything till we actually get to unlock the guy in the ice.
[14447.43s -> 14453.35s]  We have cycled right? Technically. So that's like the kind of goal right now is lunar coins.
[14453.35s -> 14462.87s]  Right so stop missing them. Basically. This game's gonna feel so much worse later when we
[14462.87s -> 14468.47s]  don't crit every single attack. I'm just realizing this now. What that we've completely ruined the
[14468.47s -> 14474.30s]  game? We've ruined the game for ourselves. There's a jellyfish boss just hanging out. I guess the
[14474.30s -> 14478.54s]  first level enemies are gonna feel so easy that it's like we have perma crits right?
[14479.50s -> 14491.19s]  Top them like that. Doesn't he do the big explosion thing? Yes. We need to be aware of that.
[14491.83s -> 14505.50s]  We might just kill him first though. Oh it's happening now. All right we did it. 700 bucks.
[14506.54s -> 14514.46s]  Damn. Too bad all the chests are like 350. Let's go on a goddamn opening spree. Another healing
[14514.46s -> 14529.53s]  drone. Question mark or? Firely. Bombs on enemies. We'll go bombs. Dude I'm just the healer. I marked
[14529.53s -> 14537.42s]  the teleporter for future reference. Okay let's start opening boxes. No another one. Should I
[14537.42s -> 14546.82s]  is it uh should I just have like 10 healing drones? I will never die. I'm gonna do it.
[14553.54s -> 14563.43s]  I have too many healing drones. Let's fight. I am over by the teleporter when you want
[14564.31s -> 14567.93s]  to go. Yeah I'm coming over here now. Uh yeah let's just do it. Might as well
[14569.26s -> 14578.52s]  get it going. There's another drone another heal drone here. I have one two three four five five
[14579.08s -> 14584.62s]  can I get do I have six healing drones? I have a lot. Let's put it that way. Well I got another one.
[14584.62s -> 14590.38s]  All right good. We've got a full party on the left. I don't think they're even on the screen
[14590.38s -> 14596.06s]  anymore because there's too many of them. All right what's it gonna be? I can't even count how
[14596.06s -> 14609.96s]  many drones we have. How many? Two three four. Oh he's dying real fast. I'll take the one on the
[14609.96s -> 14623.11s]  left. All right let's see you can kill him faster. It's gonna be you. Mine's dead.
[14625.69s -> 14631.54s]  That like rapid okay we got a lot of fucking niddies but hold on I can't suck them out of
[14631.54s -> 14637.90s]  their little tubes. I can stay invisible for so long. They're going all the way across the map.
[14638.78s -> 14647.40s]  All right the bosses are dead now I just have to not give me that give me this. What's wrong with
[14647.72s -> 14662.78s]  me? Found a coin. Wow all right we're pretty good at this game now and I want to savor this moment.
[14663.34s -> 14666.38s]  Savor it savor the moment of the fact that this is probably the only run we're going to like be
[14666.38s -> 14672.97s]  able to do this more than once. Be like gods. This is like when you finally get that Isaac run
[14673.61s -> 14677.05s]  where you just walk into the room you push the fire button everything dies.
[14677.93s -> 14685.08s]  Kind of. Did you uh did I get it did you pick up the item? Nope okay get it. I forget if I wait
[14685.08s -> 14690.76s]  did I? Maybe not but you actually you know what you should be picking if there's like damage items
[14690.76s -> 14695.22s]  they should be going to you if I'm completely honest. Well the pandalir is just ammo pack to
[14695.22s -> 14701.62s]  reset cooldowns which is more your yeah but I kind of just do dps but you're if they're like
[14701.62s -> 14705.22s]  do more damage to boss if those bullets show up that you should be taking them.
[14708.38s -> 14713.58s]  I'm invisible for so long after damaging the all the heal bots swirling around this chaos I love it.
[14714.38s -> 14726.23s]  All right let's go time to loot. I will go the other way. Oh five bucklers that reduce damage
[14726.23s -> 14737.30s]  while sprinting is pretty cool. Anybody see anything? Uh shrine of chance. Gunner. I had
[14737.30s -> 14748.68s]  to do it. I did. Oh god. Sorry. Just move faster out of combat I think I already have a couple of
[14748.68s -> 14765.11s]  these. I also got that. This is very fast. Can't lose them all. Going for broke at the casino.
[14767.83s -> 14784.36s]  Me too. I got a fucking what is it okay what is going on? Who's dropped who is dropping this
[14784.36s -> 14796.60s]  shit all over me? Okay all right I activated another drone for fun so that's all my money.
[14798.65s -> 14805.61s]  I got faster sprint. Ready? I'm ready. Did you get a squeak? Yeah what was that? It's like the soft
[14805.61s -> 14811.80s]  landing. I think chance to block incoming damage teddy bear squeak. People throwing rocks down at
[14811.80s -> 14824.60s]  us. Yeah I thought I just died. This game is just laughing its ass off at us. It is. It's going to
[14824.60s -> 14829.24s]  have to send enemies with enough HP that it's okay if they get cribbed every single time. What have
[14829.24s -> 14844.09s]  we got in here? Stun. None of these are worth it. Where's the casino over here? Did we? No we do
[14844.09s -> 14856.84s]  not dare activate the scary thing right? No no way. Probably not. I mean we could. No no this is
[14856.84s -> 14863.24s]  such a good run. Let's play it safe. We need to play this safe. We have to like try to get like high
[14863.24s -> 14871.56s]  as high as we can. That hurt. Well we're in the right city to do that. That probably if I didn't
[14871.56s -> 14878.81s]  have the heavy damage thing that probably would have been an instant kill. I would have dead. 400
[14878.81s -> 14894.18s]  what's in here uh the unknown the unknown sure it's gasoline man the gambling is getting
[14894.18s -> 14904.58s]  significantly more expensive yeah it is the super crates are almost a thousand each uh the
[14904.58s -> 14916.34s]  teleporters over here this way we can activate it if you'd like to do it and then run around
[14917.06s -> 14920.26s]  but uh there's like a fire elite enemy over here it's gonna be a big pain in the ass
[14921.06s -> 14928.81s]  hold on i just want to open one of these boxes then i'll be ready yeah this guy right here is
[14928.81s -> 14944.25s]  gonna die okay i'm ready this like fire okay yeah yeah yeah yeah oh dead instantly holy shit i'm
[14944.25s -> 14950.44s]  dead instantly okay yeah that was a 100 health kill did you come back to life yeah i got had
[14950.44s -> 14953.72s]  the item that maybe brought me back you gotta kill we gotta kill that fire thing
[14954.98s -> 14972.78s]  jesus i ain't fucking around with that anymore dude bye just oh my god look at this aoe are you
[14972.78s -> 14985.37s]  dead again yeah oh my god fire guy's dead yeah i'm gone got melted all right so i guess i should
[14985.37s -> 14990.33s]  just activate the thing where is it you might as well just activate it no you have 1200 health
[14990.33s -> 15002.71s]  that's right yeah because that thing was one hit killing me it is it where is it uh but it's
[15003.27s -> 15008.33s]  things below you but it's like to the bottom left below yeah down there it's like underneath
[15008.33s -> 15019.24s]  there yeah so much is that fire guy still alive maybe it might be able to do it you have like
[15019.24s -> 15034.14s]  100% crits it's possible oh my god the drones stay right so even all the drones that were
[15034.14s -> 15042.22s]  purchased get to stick around i spent my whole life savings on all these healing drones i hope
[15042.22s -> 15065.42s]  they help you can i go under here no that's too thick holy shit 58 you're doing like 600
[15065.42s -> 15078.54s]  damage a shot with that thing wow you might actually do this if you you know me that's at
[15078.54s -> 15091.72s]  36 it's gonna be hard but if it is very possible if you just kill both bosses and just oh there's
[15091.72s -> 15102.97s]  three you do so much fucking damage though you really do i don't have any more healers
[15103.69s -> 15111.14s]  they're just spotting so many around me they're there the drone army is being
[15111.14s -> 15120.20s]  depleted there's only three about two hit drone army is gone two left out of uh like 12
[15121.08s -> 15126.38s]  i'll just go this way and cruise for a minute if that's cool
[15128.14s -> 15134.92s]  i'm gonna hang out over here on the lovely side of the map you had like 20 what you leveled up
[15134.92s -> 15145.40s]  why would yeah but oh my god oh hi oh if only he had some slugs he'd be doing just fun if only
[15145.40s -> 15153.75s]  i had any healing survivability whatsoever there are two healing drones somewhere apparently
[15154.89s -> 15156.81s]  are they like stuck somewhere because they have full health
[15168.49s -> 15180.22s]  oh we knew it was coming yeah we knew it was coming that was still pretty good that was still
[15180.22s -> 15190.20s]  fun yeah we made the loop so how do we unlock the other uh three characters let's take a look at
[15190.20s -> 15200.50s]  the main menu yeah let's see because we got one of them complete 30 stages is the other one
[15200.50s -> 15207.74s]  we should be on the way itself requires pause what the hell is obliterate yourself at the obelisk
[15207.74s -> 15219.96s]  mean okay i'm gonna have to mute for a second because uh mute for a second where does he go
[15221.35s -> 15229.03s]  uh but uh what does that mean what does that mean what do you do you have to get to stage seven to
[15229.03s -> 15235.67s]  spawn a portal you unlock four of them by just playing normally the other two require you to
[15235.67s -> 15245.99s]  spend 10 lunar coins and get to stage seven okay obliterate is completing a run will we just on
[15247.29s -> 15265.00s]  level seven you kill yourself in a portal okay that was six we should do this pretty soon though
[15265.00s -> 15284.74s]  i wish it showed you how many you've done can i see that information to feed the teleporter
[15284.74s -> 15296.28s]  boss in under 15 seconds uh there's more page defeat 3000 enemies reach 300 move speed
[15297.48s -> 15307.13s]  some crazy things are crazy things are happening yeah what are you good what happened um
[15308.17s -> 15322.49s]  somebody just misclicked and uh gave 100 gifts up oh a hundred subs oh good nice holy shit that's
[15322.49s -> 15338.78s]  fucking crazy a hundred a hundred i can't refund they're mine now complete 30 stages so we're
[15339.86s -> 15352.17s]  we'll probably get this 30 stage thing uh probably next or one or two more maybe
[15356.57s -> 15376.04s]  italics has asked you to play risk of rain i'll try i'll try it i've heard it was pretty fun all
[15376.04s -> 15396.50s]  right i'm gonna yeah i'm gonna stay i'll stay decline decline it who should i be um i just
[15396.50s -> 15401.86s]  don't i don't i'm not a big kind of default character i like the default weapon but i
[15401.86s -> 15415.10s]  don't like the move set yeah i enjoyed getting super crits as multi but um we could do double
[15415.10s -> 15422.79s]  huntress probably not a big deal i haven't played huntress in a while i would like to try it
[15424.92s -> 15446.73s]  yeah let's do double hunter okay all right let's let's go hurt yourself shrine got it
[15446.73s -> 15484.02s]  mm-hmm 39 dollars boxes quick come on somebody enemies die got it 27 30
[15484.02s -> 15511.61s]  oh air shot what the fuck was that nice aim all right there's two more over here
[15517.58s -> 15523.74s]  why am i not doing a face cam i don't do face cam i do face cam like sometimes i don't i don't do
[15523.74s -> 15529.53s]  face cam i really haven't been doing it much this stream either games like this are really good for
[15529.53s -> 15534.57s]  it because you're like your tongue is being chewed between your teeth and you're like we're trying
[15534.57s -> 15540.33s]  hard yeah you just like you mashing down on your tongue you guys want to see me just fucking chewing
[15540.33s -> 15549.80s]  on my tongue no i'm gonna be lie to you i don't i don't really do face cam i do it sometimes
[15553.85s -> 15565.88s]  that's not a lie that is a truth all right we probably uh let's get this started probably
[15565.88s -> 15591.64s]  the best damn it that's a drone 55 ah all right let's do it is it right there oh jesus what the
[15591.64s -> 15609.66s]  hell happened here he's having a bad hair day the jewel the joke there is every day is a bad hair
[15609.66s -> 15623.32s]  day right um so we ready i'm ready i'm turning it on all right let's do it it is jellyfish
[15632.26s -> 15637.70s]  kind of a bad place yeah well it's just a bad it's a bad enemy for us because we can't use our
[15639.11s -> 15646.71s]  fourth does this count as lines i don't think arrows hit right no they do they do i hope these
[15646.71s -> 15667.78s]  count as line of sight you're doing it whoo don't do it don't do it yeah the mouse too for this
[15667.78s -> 15679.16s]  class is amazing oh i thought he was doing the super that didn't hit it in what world are you
[15679.16s -> 15698.79s]  doing it this is the super that almost insta kills me that's good oh what do you drop the hell is
[15698.79s -> 15703.75s]  this they're kind of in weird spots aren't they you link the image they're just like hanging out
[15703.75s -> 15726.04s]  up here that guy's too far away i don't care about uh what about any more boxes yeah we killed him
[15726.04s -> 15751.98s]  pretty slowly dude where are the boxes for this particular one down this way i mean we weren't
[15751.98s -> 15757.10s]  95 philabias is taking so oh yeah did we just we just so good at killing the boss i guess we
[15757.10s -> 15764.76s]  not just standing in the teleporter that whole time i feel like we've been here for way too long
[15769.02s -> 15784.82s]  there's so many stationary turrets on this one and nothing to spend yeah we just gotta go i'm
[15784.82s -> 15796.52s]  ready to hit it and you're ready uh one sec coin where's the coin coin the coin spawn randomly or
[15796.52s -> 15811.56s]  is there like one on every level i don't know i feel like it's random all right we're gonna
[15811.56s -> 15818.20s]  we're gonna be in medium on the second yeah i think i've spent as much as i can we get two of the
[15818.20s -> 15825.16s]  kind of slowest damage characters we might get screwed here yeah dps a little low we're going
[15825.16s -> 15838.12s]  to the desert though abandoned aqueduct is that a hurt yourself item no there's a fish item what
[15838.12s -> 15883.32s]  is it what's the fish do combat nope 67 dollars such a vast landscape and no money uh give me
[15883.32s -> 15915.35s]  something ah yeah i feel like this takes forever to kill anything we really did spoil ourselves so
[15915.35s -> 15926.46s]  bad critting every single time and then just like yeah yeah yeah yeah three four five dead
[15926.46s -> 15945.00s]  a lot of enemies over here i've got money now can i buy something oh what is the bottle flame
[15945.64s -> 15959.48s]  too expensive is what it is all right okay do you get the impression that some of these maps are
[15959.48s -> 15967.74s]  way too big sometimes yeah i feel like this these maps in particular are just enormous
[15968.54s -> 15980.10s]  and it doesn't really add anything um well it's probably a time thing right they make it bigger
[15980.10s -> 15986.50s]  because they want you to spend more time on this area i guess trying to figure out where to go
[15999.86s -> 16008.86s]  uh any sign of the teleporter yes i have a sign of the teleporter by me
[16009.66s -> 16023.14s]  don't want that don't i don't want any of those uh whenever i get like the bounce right click it's
[16023.14s -> 16036.57s]  like jubilantke this really is just smite welcome to smite uh you ready for the teleporter i guess
[16036.57s -> 16045.40s]  yeah kind of just hovering in its general area looking for a last box or two i still have money
[16045.40s -> 16066.46s]  but there's a lot of secrets on higher areas of maps uh i see uh at the tp let me turn it on you
[16066.46s -> 16073.10s]  seem to have spawned a lunar coin which i grabbed oh good how many do you have uh i have four
[16073.90s -> 16083.18s]  okay so i have five yeah we're pretty much even it's always this guy huh apparently
[16089.78s -> 16095.21s]  dying quicker than the last thing was there's a big elite beetle next to you oh yes there is
[16099.10s -> 16106.15s]  oh he's killing me too where's my healer oh god damn it i thought he was gonna say i thought
[16106.15s -> 16132.15s]  i was gonna run towards me yeah this guy refuses to die they're nice and group fighting two bosses
[16145.10s -> 16178.07s]  get up there that's the tether be careful almost got him this game is just kenshi with
[16178.07s -> 16189.78s]  teleporter it's what i don't even know what that means kenshi with teleport i don't even know what
[16189.78s -> 16196.09s]  that means is because it's a desert is that the that has to be the reference are there any more
[16196.09s -> 16206.57s]  boxes some lucky stones i guess that was a joke about another person's comparison now i see
[16207.21s -> 16228.28s]  i don't see anything over here nothing if you have 242 it's almost a guaranteed lucky shrine
[16228.28s -> 16243.03s]  up here almost guaranteed i got 700 i'll try i'll give it a whirl no well hey i got an extra jump
[16243.67s -> 16262.39s]  hopu feather attack speed good is this 160 come on yes let me know when you're ready because i
[16262.39s -> 16273.75s]  spent all my money gambling i am ready i have two of those bucklers so is that just straight up like
[16273.75s -> 16282.84s]  10 damage reduction 20 um i don't know it's a chance it just says reduces while sprinting i
[16282.84s -> 16300.87s]  don't know what the percentage is 127 yeah we have such a little dps yeah we're already on hard
[16302.07s -> 16308.50s]  i want to get that other character though yeah we just have to complete stages right i guess
[16308.50s -> 16319.98s]  yeah we have we have to be close we were at least 70 plus percent of the way there did you could you
[16319.98s -> 16324.41s]  see how many we completed in the log it doesn't take you there's no number but it's like a bar
[16325.66s -> 16336.31s]  i see what i got money so i just need to stay sprinting the entire time
[16337.03s -> 16354.82s]  it's kind of hard to aim when you do that though when you beat 30 total levels i wonder what
[16354.82s -> 16376.20s]  jesus i wonder how far we are we probably at like 28 no bad oh god how did i end up in here
[16378.55s -> 16382.23s]  where are you oh there we go kind of just stuffed inside of that thing
[16388.74s -> 16403.93s]  opening a chest will launch fireworks oh okay i'm getting killed here i'm gonna get the hell out
[16403.93s -> 16423.26s]  of here there we go the fireworks is actually kind of cool even the little money chest huh
[16423.26s -> 16432.49s]  that's crazy the hell is on the ground here okay like 10 monster or environment logs good job
[16432.49s -> 16438.62s]  i feel like i'm getting destroyed you look like you're getting destroyed i'm just getting
[16438.62s -> 16455.05s]  hammered i'm kind of leaving you alone so it's also my fault but there's stuff up here that i
[16455.05s -> 16476.06s]  need and i have enough money to open something this is a big map isn't it just keeps going and
[16476.06s -> 16495.83s]  going all right i'm gambling again i'm going for it i'm gonna do it ready told you did you get it
[16495.83s -> 16507.24s]  i did all right we got it we're gonna we gotta go we're gonna die at this boss we this boss is
[16507.24s -> 16516.04s]  gonna fucking destroy us yes i cannot deny it but i did find the uh the spot at least i have
[16516.04s -> 16534.26s]  equipment yeah you ready uh where is the oh it's over there by you i was just over there yeah we're
[16534.26s -> 16552.86s]  in very hard mode now into uncharted territory yeah so the what is the red down arrow that's
[16552.86s -> 16563.42s]  stun or slow the red i think the red down arrows attack down maybe it was slow yeah maybe
[16564.14s -> 16575.24s]  i don't know all right let's do it pump it up might as well let's spawn the
[16576.60s -> 16584.17s]  it's the imp the imp overload apparently slow the teleporter oh shit oh that's a lot of people
[16592.62s -> 16597.18s]  so many lasers pointing across it's also difficult for the huntress to get kills because
[16597.18s -> 16605.88s]  the auto aim if any enemies get in between yeah it is you do that really good aoe though
[16606.76s -> 16613.02s]  yeah be very helpful and you can sprint faster than these like robot lasers can catch up to you
[16613.90s -> 16635.80s]  pretty much just sprint circle shoot oh damn it yeah we're doing so little damage it's funny
[16639.05s -> 16645.54s]  no well they're almost not spawning anymore so that's good yeah i mean the teleporter is
[16645.54s -> 16665.96s]  almost 99 then we just have to defeat the boss so it should be doable now almost dead
[16667.00s -> 16676.94s]  some of these balls running around okay 99 god damn always right when i do the aoe teleport
[16677.66s -> 16705.24s]  we're like at the halfway point it's like half dead our basic attacks is so pitiful
[16707.06s -> 16721.56s]  oh need a bop bop character need to bop bop did he go all the way across the map
[16723.29s -> 16731.35s]  uh he's all the way down here he went all the way down here time is still ticking too wait
[16731.35s -> 16743.67s]  teleporting back is he coming back hey teleporting bosses gotta love him what oh there he is he just
[16743.67s -> 16773.34s]  kind of fell oh die yeah double aoe doesn't mean a whole lot right now not really really with 75
[16773.34s -> 16780.70s]  left coming back to hell all right to be honest we should just go all right you get both of those
[16781.42s -> 16788.60s]  why i don't know because you have two of them already just get it what that that's something
[16788.60s -> 16794.92s]  that does uh explosions right detonate on kill yeah you got three of them now okay so there you
[16794.92s -> 16803.11s]  go so now you got three are we gonna stick around to loot or do we pretty much get everything um i
[16803.11s -> 16807.99s]  think we have solidified the fact that we're going to lose so i would say we should probably
[16807.99s -> 16814.31s]  just complete it and try to complete the next one and you know try to unlock the other character
[16815.11s -> 16823.19s]  that's what i would say hey well i found a couple boxes you tell me when you want to go but go ahead
[16833.16s -> 16842.42s]  we are going to be an insane i wonder no not yet we're gonna get on the next thing we do we're
[16842.42s -> 16848.73s]  gonna get it what what are you talking about on the next character on the next thing we're
[16848.73s -> 16856.17s]  gonna get it on the next cycle we should get the new character oh was that the 30th stage
[16856.97s -> 16868.23s]  not that one but we're very very very close huntress is worst class in my humble opinion
[16878.98s -> 16884.66s]  hunter seems like a really good class to not both be at the same time so i learned my lesson
[16886.28s -> 16898.86s]  maybe seems like a great support doesn't seem like a like a main yet i think we need to unlock
[16898.86s -> 16906.02s]  more items i think we need more cabbages you say cabbages we need more cabbages
[16914.74s -> 16919.27s]  every class but the huntress is the worst class true i'm gonna sneeze and i have no way to meet
[16919.27s -> 16935.54s]  up society oh again last second no sneeze is always coming pairs though they do and you're
[16935.54s -> 16945.14s]  right because here comes another one thank you i'm trying to eat it i can't it's hard to eat a
[16945.14s -> 16963.80s]  sneeze i can't kill anything there's no there's no enemies character need to buff
[16972.94s -> 16982.52s]  it happened it worked oh it worked they heard my cries whoops wrong buttons those are all the
[16982.52s -> 16990.94s]  wrong buttons well that's a big guy whoa you go big guy i'm gonna come back and help you
[16991.74s -> 17015.85s]  i try to get away post for the fans oh boy i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead boy you're dead now i'm
[17015.85s -> 17034.54s]  alive i'm alive i live which one is it i live probably not for long though hey more firework
[17034.54s -> 17042.31s]  chests huh kind of a weird focus that i have for this run i open stuff good get away from me
[17044.15s -> 17058.28s]  get away from me what is that 3d glasses uh i'm on teleporters over here i wouldn't spawn any of
[17058.28s -> 17068.02s]  that until this big guy's dead though okay probably for the best he is dead all right i wouldn't
[17068.02s -> 17079.99s]  spawn that until we're ready to grow and we're probably we're an impossible all right i'm ready
[17079.99s -> 17089.11s]  impossible yes so it says but i don't believe it let's see if it's possible mega oh it's the
[17089.11s -> 17101.32s]  magma worm we haven't seen this in a while i'm not sure whether to be real dagger okay got
[17101.32s -> 17116.57s]  ceremonial dagger i'm going for ultimate crits i can't even see what the fuck is going on
[17117.29s -> 17126.92s]  honestly i have no idea i know these enemies the whole screen is red and glowing sometimes i
[17126.92s -> 17150.07s]  right click dude we can beat this magma worm it's really hard oh boy big guy over on the left
[17150.71s -> 17165.78s]  he's here huge huge monster a cyclops guy so many boxes just sitting right up here too
[17170.33s -> 17183.46s]  trying to help with the cyclops guy yeah i'm dying i'm invisible so i'm gonna run too
[17183.46s -> 17191.21s]  i think we'll get it yeah i think we're gonna get it we're definitely got the 99 so that's good
[17191.21s -> 17205.30s]  now we just have to do magma guy no don't jump up please i assume he's a lot harder in 3d than he
[17205.30s -> 17233.91s]  is in 2d so is this just a 3d reimagining of the first game i believe yes 3d remake my god he's
[17233.91s -> 17246.44s]  coming is he dead uh he's like jumping higher he's deciding to jump much higher now he's there we go
[17247.26s -> 17255.64s]  proceed through the teleporter uh we did pretty well do you want to look for boxes let's look for

[17301.29s -> 17321.18s]  legendary chest in the middle in the middle define the middle they have global range the middle
[17324.22s -> 17337.38s]  where was that it uh legendary chest cost four thousand dollars well we will be passing on that
[17337.38s -> 17350.86s]  we will not be doing that one it's between two structures in the ground level uh cube or crits
[17350.86s -> 17362.28s]  i'm gonna say cube maybe okay double crits let's go yeah teammates revive on the next floor
[17364.36s -> 17381.72s]  now he's dead forever uninstalled if you die again we are not friends weird that that also

[17392.79s -> 17404.65s]  with icicles every interactable spawns missiles that's fucking hilarious um is there a reason why
[17404.65s -> 17420.89s]  i can't move what's going on okay that was weird my keyboard took a second to not lag
[17438.44s -> 17444.07s]  well that made quick work of them yeah i have two active charges i guess you went to a combat
[17444.07s -> 17477.22s]  challenge over here yeah for money there's a guy oh ow ow ow hurt pain missiles got a lot of money
[17479.29s -> 17485.94s]  that's what combat challenges are good for that is so much money two thousand dollars right now
[17486.58s -> 17504.10s]  that really wasn't a big deal at all uh teleporter is also here we got gasoline
[17504.10s -> 17513.45s]  ow what the hell was that was the big guy move even faster probably not a bad turret spot
[17514.17s -> 17536.14s]  what is this uh 3d printer for i don't know more fireworks on interactibles cool i could
[17536.14s -> 17543.64s]  help with some more stuff man i got so much money some stuff over by me two ish three ish chest

[17710.54s -> 17724.84s]  him the lasers are still homing though which is kind of annoying you can't even touch me what oh
[17724.84s -> 17730.36s]  that's bullshit dude that they are they call they stick right on your body no matter how fast you're
[17730.36s -> 17746.89s]  going you're right i sent uh two orbs in there and just mass killed everybody the black hole
[17746.89s -> 17761.98s]  arrow rain yeah that was a sick multi-kill i'm trying to freeze them i don't know if you can
[17761.98s -> 17773.83s]  freeze bosses but i have a freeze aura freeze god damn it why we're doing surprisingly well
[17773.83s -> 17795.83s]  i should be able to outrun that ouch ouch ouch ow it hurts i just took fall damage there
[17801.93s -> 17810.09s]  i can like not hurt anything though oh boy all right 89 teleporter getting there
[17813.45s -> 17816.49s]  there's so many of these guys oh my god yeah there's a ton
[17818.41s -> 17829.77s]  jesus oh man trying to freeze them all down oh we got a blue portal which apparently we don't need
[17829.77s -> 17837.42s]  they dead boss is dead teleporter is active um did i pick up the boss loot already
[17838.52s -> 17842.12s]  uh what was the achievement we just got there's another boss loot here
[17847.59s -> 17856.97s]  uh i didn't pick one up yet i don't think yeah i picked up chrono bobble too i don't know what
[17856.97s -> 17863.37s]  that is so do we have enough to unlock this guy there's a coin where's this coin all right you
[17863.37s -> 17875.51s]  got five you get five coins right uh i have five coins so you also have five coins yes cool oops
[17877.48s -> 17883.96s]  all right i don't think there's any more chests here to be honest no we've i kind of went around
[17883.96s -> 17893.83s]  the whole map i have like 10 000 gold yeah you need you each need 10 oh yeah okay there's some
[17893.83s -> 17905.14s]  boxes back here no let's see if i can find any all right we're gonna look we're gonna check it out
[17911.22s -> 17921.88s]  i don't see anything all right could try it what is it something good cube uh i like the missiles
[17922.44s -> 17950.44s]  i sound like a bunch of horses i don't see anything else i think we're good to leave
[17953.00s -> 17960.41s]  there is a way you can end a run after a loop interesting you can leave whenever okay well
[17960.41s -> 17967.59s]  we're gonna get some levels though you should go on the portal or should we just leave uh probably
[17967.59s -> 17976.52s]  just leave okay just go yeah your move speed seems to make your uh teleporter like your dash
[17976.52s -> 17981.56s]  go much further portal is if you have 10 times move speed then you've got to be teleporting like
[17981.56s -> 17985.32s]  crazy i think we just fucked ourselves i think we have we were supposed to go on the portal
[17985.32s -> 17990.44s]  for like the win condition why i think we can like win like end the run or something when
[17991.64s -> 17996.20s]  not i thought that was the shop we went there last time and we did it as a waste of time
[17996.20s -> 18001.64s]  yeah wait why is everybody freaking out last time everyone said don't go there
[18002.28s -> 18008.94s]  all right i'm just gonna find the portal i'll just be i'll be portal finder okay or uh i mean
[18009.50s -> 18025.11s]  the finder of is a now there's a boss over there fire a nice power it is here it is currently
[18025.11s -> 18031.27s]  being guarded by it's a giant jellyfish over here i actually have decent attack speed no
[18031.27s -> 18053.30s]  giant jellyfish huh there is a big jellyfish this way hello i'm gonna get some items that's
[18053.38s -> 18064.38s]  the slug all chests are like 531 very very expensive do like one more chest and then open the
[18065.50s -> 18072.04s]  pandora's box i'll help you with the jelly jellyfish more equipment
[18095.61s -> 18105.38s]  fire yep the burning ticking damage is like the worst defender out of everybody i think
[18107.10s -> 18113.74s]  yeah the fire fire damage seems to be super super like over tuned yeah you can just die like in a
[18113.74s -> 18126.06s]  second if you hit by far oh oh oh are we good i think i think i missed it because i was in the
[18126.06s -> 18143.64s]  air i got caught out this is not even the boss no oh my god did i want to whoa whoa wow oh yeah
[18143.64s -> 18155.51s]  sorry fire hit me oh you're dead i'm about to be dead i think i got hit by like two fire blasts and
[18155.51s -> 18168.22s]  it was just doing it yeah that fire damage is a ton at least it got to be fast that was fun
[18168.22s -> 18183.21s]  so they run around like that again is this a line of sight all right i guess i will try
[18184.50s -> 18186.66s]  good luck just say we did it
[18192.39s -> 18211.88s]  oh my god ah i pressed the wrong buttons yeah the beetle queen is really well poisoned but
[18214.01s -> 18219.77s]  you have to fight all this yeah like i can't look at all those robots they can't even move this
[18219.77s -> 18226.81s]  stuck okay that was that was seriously like diablo 3 level of numbers in the screen yes
[18227.93s -> 18237.24s]  accurate uh people are saying you have fungus run away and regenerate if you get low um okay
[18237.24s -> 18248.94s]  that's like like like run away like far away i don't know how accurate that is but seems pretty
[18248.94s -> 18264.07s]  accurate we're doing it why is italics doing so much more damage uh because i traded all of my
[18264.07s -> 18271.77s]  items for boots to run 100 faster and ran around in circles i'm not i'm not done yet
[18273.42s -> 18284.22s]  like i haven't i haven't won yet you know i got a little damage i do to this guy
[18284.86s -> 18299.50s]  this is like another boss that just spawned in okay i guess i fly now yeah wait okay do you
[18299.50s -> 18305.50s]  are you invulnerable when you touch that teleporter or does everything have to be dead around here oh
[18305.50s -> 18318.94s]  god oh boy if you touch the porter are you immune oh i think you can touch it and
[18319.90s -> 18333.34s]  run away and it'll just port you wherever you are trying to heal okay god they found me i guess
[18333.34s -> 18348.31s]  yeah you're not immune but you can just run the wisp is so good with this many mobs yeah that's
[18348.31s -> 18367.26s]  why he has like three or four of them what's the wisp the explosion thing right yeah just touch it
[18368.06s -> 18374.58s]  touch what touch the teleporter and run it'll just pull you out wherever you are
[18375.22s -> 18382.82s]  although you know you might get one shot here there you go huh there's like a small probability
[18382.82s -> 18388.66s]  possibility of dying and we're back yeah what and you're almost dead what's that
[18391.88s -> 18395.24s]  that wasn't fair you better run what the fuck was that
[18396.44s -> 18401.16s]  why is everyone spawned into enemies they were just sitting there waiting for us
[18407.38s -> 18412.04s]  all right uh we see we ain't gonna make it past this one what's that thing
[18415.24s -> 18421.77s]  uh there's a big ring oh what is no that's just a guy we are actually in hell now yeah we kind of
[18421.77s -> 18442.50s]  are well i want this box yeah now there's just bosses in the level with us naturally like from
[18442.50s -> 18458.44s]  the beginning what i get i already have that 700 bucks huh if we make it past this level i'm dead
[18459.40s -> 18485.35s]  if we make it past this level i'm dead i can't do it what the hell killed me was fire sprint faster
[18486.68s -> 18494.58s]  well what do i have to lose right all right burn the boss there's only gonna be like six of them
[18494.58s -> 18498.90s]  don't worry there's only one two three four five there's only five of them don't worry
[18499.62s -> 18520.78s]  not to mention the one that was already there okay well hold on a minute how are you as fast
[18520.78s -> 18526.58s]  as i was because i have three of the boots and i have sprints faster there's a goes faster and
[18526.58s -> 18532.74s]  the sprints faster so ten goat hooks is not as is the same speed as three goat hooks and sprint
[18532.74s -> 18544.39s]  faster i'm not i think i still was going faster than you what is this a sonic race like am i
[18544.39s -> 18555.06s]  knuckles right now we haven't heard like a tails race i just don't think it was worth it you know
[18555.70s -> 18565.02s]  you can do it you can kill them and then we get to complete the cycle
[18569.91s -> 18578.81s]  give it everything you have everything's on the line oh you got tethered you got tethered
[18579.45s -> 18597.90s]  i'm dead no no you're back you're back he's back he's back second win gotta go fast
[18605.37s -> 18617.46s]  you're at like 40 percent 35 percent 30 oh my god i gotta hide
[18618.10s -> 18634.42s]  oh there you go there you go come on come on so if you beat this there's gonna be a portal
[18634.42s -> 18638.78s]  that you're gonna go through instead of the teleporter and that's gonna give us both
[18639.74s -> 18665.14s]  100 gold there's still one with full health 100 that's a lot you're so close to getting rid
[18665.14s -> 18671.78s]  of one of them and that's there it is okay that's 33 percent less annoyance all right i'm gonna go
[18671.78s -> 18685.14s]  back over here chill for a second they heal during the suck phase okay i see where is he
[18685.14s -> 18694.60s]  there it's right there i'm so glad i just fed you those two items and then i threw all mine away
[18696.15s -> 18709.32s]  ow oh you could just play it slow play it simple i need full health for this guy because those
[18709.32s -> 18713.88s]  rolling chase things if i didn't go invisible i think i would be dead yeah did he do the suck
[18713.88s -> 18729.51s]  phase yet watch out for the rolling bombs why is one harder than everyone else you know what
[18729.51s -> 18734.15s]  i mean like why is it there was five of them why was that easier than one because it's the illusions
[18734.15s -> 18739.27s]  it's just the one of them that's the real one you killed all the illusions he's the illusion
[18740.15s -> 18749.80s]  my apm is probably so high right now come on dude you like give you get the boy scout badge
[18750.68s -> 18774.42s]  for doing this wow he like spawned right on top of you so close oh god
[18778.84s -> 18789.69s]  oh 55 minutes you got it 55 minutes oh my god 55 minutes all we need we're gonna see the cycle
[18789.69s -> 18806.84s]  that will be completed let's get the chant going here we go italics oh here we go here we go indeed
[18808.65s -> 18813.21s]  i think i got chunked for like 33 percent that was so close though you did so good
[18813.69s -> 18822.73s]  jingston here we go i didn't ruin it i didn't curse it there's no such thing as curses
[18822.73s -> 18835.54s]  it's no such thing as ghosts i got cursed oh that's all right oh damn let me see how close we are
[18839.50s -> 18849.08s]  he was the last guy yeah but that was fucking insanely hard like that was very difficult to do
[18849.08s -> 18861.75s]  all right let's see we how much all right we we seriously need to do like it was back here before
[18862.39s -> 18872.38s]  we'll get it here maybe next time don't ruin your build with goat feet well we have what we had to
[18872.38s -> 18884.57s]  see it you know what i mean i just wanted to see what it did all that work all right this is the
[18884.57s -> 18893.90s]  one you ready are we away from success uh we are probably like three or four levels away
[18893.90s -> 18904.31s]  so like one run probably one run one run from new character i think we can do it yeah well we
[18904.31s -> 18909.51s]  i'm gonna i'm gonna okay here we go i'm gonna try really fucking hard this time okay i'm gonna go
[18909.51s -> 18917.85s]  multi this time i feel like i did good with them last time i think i'm gonna go robot i had a really
[18917.85s -> 18926.44s]  fun build that was probably the most fun hunter's build yep there's like fast darting teleporting
[18926.44s -> 18933.94s]  let's give it a go this is the one oh yeah i have to invite you again my bad yeah there's gonna be
[18933.94s -> 18944.92s]  sweat pouring off my body i'm gonna go robot you going robot or do you want me to do double
[18944.92s -> 18950.15s]  robo one might not be that bad i could go commando if you want we could have one of each
[18953.94s -> 18968.06s]  double robo double robo double robo wait hey i don't know i'm gonna go either way on that one
[18968.06s -> 18976.84s]  double robo here we go now watching me like like run off the cliff like a funny thing
[18978.44s -> 18991.38s]  let's go oops forgot how to play all right let's just do this here we're here yeah let's go
[18991.38s -> 19008.63s]  challenge all right really you go okay that was dumb beating up dying on the first level
[19011.70s -> 19018.09s]  man the stun grenades on these groups are awesome i'm missing every shot so i'm gonna switch to
[19018.09s -> 19027.86s]  no miss smug no miss all right we get there's still somebody alive i feel like the ram should
[19027.86s -> 19039.78s]  do more damage okay uh there's still one of those enemies left he just threw is there yeah he
[19039.78s -> 19054.89s]  like really ran down here maybe he's dead i don't know okay boxes oh a coin oh nice up to six
[19055.69s -> 19061.37s]  oh you just killed him okay uh we got an activation here for the scary monster at the end
[19062.41s -> 19075.27s]  uh the mountain that's double loot man starting like a vanilla isaac run after being a literal
[19075.27s -> 19093.21s]  goddess i feel so slow it works pitiful all right well there it is oh that's better how you doing
[19094.17s -> 19103.91s]  good you found the uh portal yep yep right here by me well i am ready whenever you want to activate
[19104.55s -> 19118.07s]  all right here we go you ready yep i'm here two one activate what is it it is the
[19119.99s -> 19130.95s]  two of these things so is chance to stun amplified by scatter shot mode oh that's
[19130.95s -> 19137.32s]  like since you're shooting more bullets do you have more chance to stun or is it more damage
[19137.32s -> 19151.61s]  equals more chance i don't even know good question why are you doing that trying germa
[19151.61s -> 19162.87s]  what because i wanted the fireworks to come out and do some damage behind us careful one of those
[19162.87s -> 19179.45s]  robots if nail gun prox every time that would be completely op fair oh i shot you you look like a
[19179.45s -> 19199.00s]  bad guy oh sorry i'm screaming now okay what the fuck uh this is very bad very bad i'm gonna die
[19200.15s -> 19211.46s]  oh it's happening again this is a very bad position to be in how do you heal in this
[19211.46s -> 19224.23s]  game i'm dead oh okay i'm joining you in a brief moment well like i'm doing that you have to like
[19224.23s -> 19228.63s]  okay so this is like giant open area you have to like hide under a fucking log
[19233.94s -> 19246.31s]  well that didn't work out as planned game over game over too slow too slow it was the mountain
[19246.31s -> 19258.15s]  shrine that did us in may have been you want to be huntress and i'll be multi no you want me to be
[19258.15s -> 19262.63s]  commando i think i think double robo is not a good strat i'm willing to be commando i think we just
[19262.63s -> 19267.67s]  got screwed because we did the mountain thing we're both the slowest character and we had to fight
[19267.67s -> 19288.23s]  two of the please stand behind a rock or you'd instantly die he's the slowest character first
[19288.23s -> 19294.23s]  level death but we did do challenge mode so it was two level ones he moves the same p
[19295.37s -> 19309.29s]  he's stampede he's bigger though yeah see i'm sprinting and you're sprinting we're going the
[19309.29s -> 19324.23s]  same to going to same people on st pete oh all right hey thanks for the coin hidden free money
[19324.23s -> 19338.42s]  there's a hurt yourself up there is there for fun sure why not remember what these do oh that's a
[19338.42s -> 19356.06s]  75 percent you touched it i did yes everything's fine i'm all right accurate oh god damn it i did
[19356.06s -> 19371.00s]  shortstop it that is true all right now i need to heal damage while sprinting i was saving up for
[19371.00s -> 19381.82s]  that one let's figure out anything down go for the active what's in the active nice crit strike
[19382.62s -> 19391.30s]  there's another active right here yeah there's two anymore boxes which i don't need i marked a
[19391.30s -> 19399.86s]  crit for you there's a heal right here though i want the heal bot all right i guess we can go
[19399.86s -> 19407.77s]  ahead and fight and then search afterward something like that is there any more down this hallway
[19410.15s -> 19422.71s]  this is 34 right yeah heal fruit uh we should probably activate how you doing over there
[19423.35s -> 19445.34s]  coming back heading back start whenever let's go my accuracy is terrible what are we gonna get here
[19446.14s -> 19468.31s]  queen the ant friend queen bug oh that's a lot of you here oh god where the hell did you come from
[19479.27s -> 19495.45s]  damn down to half there's a lot of fire bugs a lot of fire i'm gonna die i'm gonna die it's been fun
[19497.00s -> 19500.44s]  damn this is going to be two in a row versus getting destroyed on the first level
[19505.54s -> 19520.84s]  jesus there's so many what the fuck why are they this many out of my way all right i'm back in the
[19520.84s -> 19556.36s]  circle it's not looking good oh god oh it hurt ow ow doesn't feel good what i can't go up those
[19556.36s -> 19582.42s]  stairs what the hell come on all right we got 99 big anna's dead all right whoo i can breathe
[19583.22s -> 19593.64s]  so we got an extra jump feather cool i forgot to use my crit the whole time
[19594.28s -> 19610.97s]  i just like it extra challenging um let's see are there any of the boxes i don't think there's
[19610.97s -> 19627.03s]  any more boxes he tried to run a shopping cart up the stairs yeah but like come on he's got legs
[19630.12s -> 19640.23s]  up top is there one up there i got uh two up this little tunnel all right we gotta get out of this
[19640.23s -> 19645.51s]  yeah hey we're doing pretty good we're just now getting to the second half of easy but yeah i'm
[19645.51s -> 19660.14s]  ready uh somebody said also well teleporter is charging the chests are red and they're easier
[19660.14s -> 19666.23s]  to see that's true that's good point they're red but we can't open them yet but we can see them
[19667.35s -> 19669.51s]  we can see them they're much easier to see on the map
[19678.26s -> 19691.30s]  hmm hurt yourself money machine yeah who wants to go first you can go first
[19692.89s -> 19706.30s]  sure there's almost no reason not to use those not really especially if you have
[19706.30s -> 19715.51s]  any way to heal yourself and we got chests i'm gonna go for the gamble here we go it worked out
[19715.51s -> 19719.59s]  no it didn't because i don't want a cube you can get two bonus items do you have an active
[19720.55s -> 19727.51s]  yes is it a cube i have the crit would you like it to be a cube no i'm happy with the crit
[19727.51s -> 19737.66s]  i think i just need to use it more i just need to actually push q oh wait i can have two right
[19737.66s -> 19746.52s]  right right right that's the point of this character's cool move exactly now you've got it
[19746.52s -> 19760.79s]  wow utility his name is multi remember that i won't all right i need to open a box
[19761.35s -> 19777.80s]  what are these little slugs coin you have uh how many coins you have uh six oh i have six too
[19777.80s -> 19793.02s]  i'll take it wow we're neck and neck do i dare do this again no what gambling no no no the
[19793.10s -> 19805.96s]  93% help i don't want that what's this i don't want that either
[19808.71s -> 19816.86s]  oh i can't believe that roll worked and what about the heel uh yeah but but if it's but it'll go on
[19816.86s -> 19823.78s]  keel down and i don't know if i quite a lot of uh stuff this way i'll claim as much as i can but
[19826.38s -> 19838.42s]  no idea where the porter is well i can gamble again you know get the fuck away from the guys
[19839.22s -> 19851.42s]  get away get away not even close to you no nothing please yeah the first dink on healthy
[19851.42s -> 19887.98s]  enemies is pretty good uh enemies hello well uh i'm gonna check down here um i see no signs
[19888.70s -> 19902.23s]  i have so much money teleporting friend is stuck in a wall all right there's some over here
[19906.17s -> 19915.34s]  hate these little fire guys we got worth no money just small annoying missile thing
[19919.32s -> 19929.27s]  uh i have like i think i have two or three of these now two huh what is this is this is this a
[19929.27s -> 19937.03s]  bleed build you have bleed i'm tempted there's a lead printer here i'm tempted by it slow enemies
[19938.15s -> 19952.76s]  have to be sprinting while that happens though bleed is bad why don't you tell the developers
[19952.76s -> 19960.76s]  or make their second game maybe they won't make the same mistake twice a lot of enemies over here
[19960.76s -> 19971.78s]  too i can take care of that like are they copying all the stats one to one like all the damage
[19971.78s -> 19982.12s]  numbers too i don't know good question but if i just get 10 bleed items and i bleed every hit
[19982.84s -> 19991.62s]  i think it's by that's percentage based or something somebody was saying i got all this
[19991.62s -> 19998.66s]  money and nothing to spend it on so are you ready to uh uh i have i'm i'm almost ready to do whatever
[19998.66s -> 20001.94s]  you'd like to do which is start because we're already like all the way up to medium
[20001.94s -> 20013.99s]  yeah we are like almost a heart this is true oh this is okay we're it's this thing yeah it's
[20014.63s -> 20035.02s]  that thing it is this thing goodbye just get like just suck them all up coming around to help
[20035.66s -> 20047.38s]  i'm almost dead though that you with the vortex that was me with the vortex
[20055.85s -> 20061.94s]  nope double jump is really good against these guys you just jump right when they shoot and
[20061.94s -> 20081.72s]  they can't hit you all right one's dead two are dead ouch god damn it fire guy fire fire fire
[20081.72s -> 20112.39s]  no no no fire bad fire very bad my god almost there jesus good all right bosses are dead
[20112.39s -> 20128.63s]  boss is dead now just the babies fuel cell an additional charge not too bad
[20129.19s -> 20137.13s]  it's good that's what the boss relic is next to you very cool what cost 67 dollars over here
[20137.85s -> 20149.69s]  why does the teleporter cost 67 bucks because they decided to start taxing it um they realized free
[20149.69s -> 20154.81s]  teleporters were bad for business and this way if you pay for your teleporter they can make more
[20154.81s -> 20167.56s]  teleporters in the future i don't think there's any more i have 800 dollars so do why but you can
[20167.56s -> 20179.50s]  take a quick look we're already almost at hard nothing that way i don't think yeah this was
[20179.50s -> 20200.12s]  pretty dry for boxes well all right whenever whenever uh it was an item okay you got the will
[20200.12s -> 20207.94s]  of the wisp yeah it was it was a box underneath hidden under the teleporter it was okay it was
[20207.94s -> 20216.42s]  like stacked on top of each other hey we've done it we've done it we did it we've unlocked the
[20216.42s -> 20262.41s]  engineer oh cool okay new character okay money money money money hypnospace what do you mean
[20263.38s -> 20285.96s]  hypnospace the engineer apparently is insane i guess uh oh do you see what i see what i see
[20285.96s -> 20294.70s]  unlimited crit run do you yeah is it possible for unlimited crit run is it worth doing it
[20294.70s -> 20302.42s]  should we take is it worth it this is if you want to ditch literally everything i mean maybe i don't
[20302.42s -> 20306.26s]  know i don't think i even have 10 items yeah i was gonna say i don't feel like i have 10
[20307.14s -> 20322.22s]  i might give up a couple yeah i'll do it like three or four times what did i give up i didn't
[20322.22s -> 20330.95s]  even see let's see what am i gonna give up here ow um i don't think the machine works
[20334.89s -> 20339.69s]  i think the machine's broken the machine is broken i don't do i not have any items
[20340.41s -> 20347.61s]  i don't think i have any items i can put in here what i apparently all your items do you have any
[20347.61s -> 20355.03s]  i don't have any white items somehow okay this is gonna be bad so group them up yeah we're like
[20355.03s -> 20363.83s]  really weak right now for some reason i got two glasses i'll go for like 30 seems good
[20364.55s -> 20381.70s]  have fun with it i hope you love it all right i need to get a box 40 is reasonable that's a lot
[20381.70s -> 20391.56s]  of games is the teleporter berserkers pauldron enter a frenzy after killing three enemies in
[20391.56s -> 20398.90s]  succession okay do we want to go ahead and pump this or we're already in very hard so we may as
[20398.90s -> 20411.51s]  well explore which one i would probably save that bad option there's not been a good loot
[20412.15s -> 20428.60s]  box rng run oh they're all here i think yeah we need to have more stuff they're not yeah i did
[20433.53s -> 20447.74s]  yes i'm gonna go get more crit i'm go this way what i have any other boxes i think this one in
[20447.74s -> 20460.47s]  here i didn't pick up the item all the stuff finally something over here okay time for more
[20460.47s -> 20472.55s]  crit and then we can start triple jump now uh it's being a crit you want to buy a crit 133 bucks
[20472.55s -> 20482.71s]  there's another there's one over here you can buy you want to buy that you can eat how much money
[20482.71s -> 20490.39s]  you have i want to buy what there's a crit for 133 dollars you can buy another crit oh right over
[20490.39s -> 20500.84s]  here it's on my marker coming to you now i will have 90 percent you could use i have to lose my
[20500.84s -> 20505.08s]  hooves so i'm now very slow and you want me to just buy this all right well i'm just gonna buy
[20505.08s -> 20517.54s]  this i have 576 yeah i just got pushed into it i was standing there and got pushed into it
[20518.58s -> 20541.80s]  what the fuck all right let's go push the thing oh bm i didn't mean to do that there was something
[20541.80s -> 20561.50s]  else up there too i don't know what it was now uh magma worm oh even sure it was easy
[20562.14s -> 20588.23s]  so stacking my crits on my crits probably doesn't do very much suck them all in still 80 percent
[20588.23s -> 20621.64s]  crits is pretty solid didn't mean to press that button but i did the key is kind of just always
[20622.60s -> 20633.94s]  because he just kind of idly chases you a lot of money holy shit that's so many things up there
[20633.94s -> 20645.75s]  that's bad oh my god there's so many of them holy shit oh god it was all going so well until it
[20645.75s -> 20668.23s]  wasn't all right we should be fine oh no sunglasses rip i didn't mean to push e where did they go
[20671.27s -> 20675.91s]  i died that was uh that was real i've kind of told i kind of killed myself
[20675.91s -> 20683.08s]  with fall damage i may have fallen to my death as is want to happen the good news is
[20683.88s -> 20689.64s]  you're almost got it i do and you need more items than i do anyway so you can just have both
[20689.64s -> 20698.33s]  he's dead he has been killed two guitars ukulele one guitar two guitar we don't have enough to do
[20698.33s -> 20707.98s]  the portal right i don't think so no so you're free to go whenever you want uh well we probably
[20707.98s -> 20715.78s]  should just go portal portal portal portal everyone's screaming portal portal use portal
[20716.42s -> 20731.14s]  get in the portal might as well check out portal okay we're going into apparently going in the
[20731.14s -> 20743.64s]  portal the bizarre between time i just fucking fell off might be able to convert some items
[20743.64s -> 20749.72s]  for something good should we try this like item conversion i don't even know how this works
[20749.72s -> 20755.16s]  yeah i don't understand how it works either that's the buckler and i don't know what that item is
[20755.16s -> 20760.52s]  10 lunar alien head all right chat wrote alien head in all caps so i'm just gonna push e
[20762.49s -> 20769.86s]  wait what'd you get how do you do it i think i think you're doing it are you doing it i think
[20769.86s -> 20778.79s]  you just did it twice i don't think i'm doing it you have to have five green items i only have
[20779.35s -> 20788.60s]  oh two three i have three green items i see so how is it white items for the green one then i guess
[20788.60s -> 20794.97s]  oh i see it's sort of green text so germa should do it germa do it don't do it okay
[20795.85s -> 20799.77s]  germa get up there do it do it don't do it don't do it don't do it do it you should do it
[20799.77s -> 20810.82s]  it's not worth it it is worth it duality all right you ready you're gonna jump in the pool
[20810.82s -> 20818.68s]  it's scary well good thing we went here but i guess it's better to look except it's not
[20818.68s -> 20824.92s]  because now we're gonna be an impossible difficulty don't do it it's op but do not do it
[20826.57s -> 20833.64s]  whatever just kill the lizard it reduces cooldowns but you don't rely on cooldowns okay
[20834.28s -> 20847.64s]  look at this bad spawn bad spawn unbelievable that doesn't interrupt them i feel like it should
[20849.24s -> 20860.97s]  why did you spawn right here this is insane mode so you have to be apparently crazy and
[20860.97s -> 20874.98s]  unexpected i love these green mushrooms growing from my shoulders so bouncy so there's a i don't
[20874.98s -> 20879.86s]  know if you want to do this is a party i don't know what a party party shrine i want to go to
[20879.86s -> 20891.45s]  a party combat shrine probably should we do it uh yeah combat shrine might as well what is it
[20893.43s -> 20917.42s]  bad guy five clock bell friends what i didn't hit that even i feel so weak even with 70 70
[20917.42s -> 20925.48s]  percent crit i'm dead that's why yeah i'm dead oh no i feel very weak fire damage killed me
[20926.28s -> 20939.94s]  there's no way i can bring it back new well i have two thousand four hundred dollars should i just
[20939.94s -> 20975.74s]  go open the chest i have almost three grand damn i missed it three thousand four thousand right
[20977.67s -> 20991.21s]  you have two double jumps i know i know i'm just not using them so where's this magic legendary
[20991.21s -> 20997.70s]  chest apparently it's in the middle of the map it's literally right next to me oh you're standing
[20997.70s -> 21004.54s]  on it 3,700 bucks i mean you might be able to buy and see what's in it in a moment or i'll die
[21004.54s -> 21022.47s]  time for you to carry me i got it okay what's in it what's in it what's in it what is it it's
[21022.47s -> 21030.94s]  it's borderlands 3 it's the ceremonial dagger oh killing an enemy releases homing daggers i've got
[21030.94s -> 21035.90s]  this at a regular chest like three times have you yeah i have never gotten that item
[21037.29s -> 21048.04s]  that's this was four grand well all right that's worth four grand that's three that was 39
[21048.04s -> 21053.91s]  of 3,700 bucks i have two of them you have two daggers right now that's what i'm saying i picked
[21053.91s -> 21059.98s]  it up like a random buck those daggers are gonna murder people all right let's find the thing let
[21059.98s -> 21071.70s]  me see if i can just kill the boss this is gonna be nightmare it's right here these belt things
[21071.70s -> 21090.31s]  are gonna be a pain in the ass i already know it here we go what we got stone titan right next to
[21091.11s -> 21143.50s]  it's it's two holy shit jesus i don't know what this is but i'm gonna grab it oh it's a heal bot
[21148.54s -> 21171.06s]  fuck trying to jump up here and he's having to keep spawning the things underneath me
[21171.70s -> 21203.53s]  all right here we go let's see if i can get some daggers here and oh no fucking way i got
[21203.53s -> 21218.76s]  melted good try well let's try the uh engineer the new character yeah see what it is the engineer
[21218.76s -> 21225.77s]  bouncing nades mines bubble shield auto turrets oh baby so it's gonna be
[21227.10s -> 21245.51s]  10 characters i guess six in the game now looks like it eight grenades three thousands of mines
[21246.23s -> 21264.65s]  so you can put down a bubble shield that's weird he's very boring but he's op very boring huh i
[21264.65s -> 21273.18s]  don't know if he's apparently i've ever said that about a person who places turrets everybody likes
[21273.18s -> 21282.10s]  placing turrets right well i want to see it well we got to try it out mine eight bounce nades
[21282.98s -> 21296.81s]  super mine there's so much to look at let's see oh this is cool what eight okay
[21297.45s -> 21306.78s]  okay so right click mine now can i activate these no okay they have to recharge very slowly as well
[21307.50s -> 21314.20s]  so then what is this one what is that that's a shield oh nice bubble shield now we're playing
[21314.20s -> 21321.72s]  edf apparently and then what's the cooldown on the other one on turret so we can shoot out but they
[21321.72s -> 21332.04s]  can't shoot in the best kind of shield uh hold left click down to shoot this seems like this
[21332.04s -> 21341.05s]  game just got 45 easier did it with i mean you can put two turrets down that seems fucking amazing
[21342.01s -> 21350.79s]  we had five community subs from rin the cutest thank you rin wow i'm liking you one shot enemies
[21350.79s -> 21355.83s]  with left click i guess you can do that as the um thank you so much for the subs multi as well
[21355.83s -> 21367.72s]  five bring them in thank you and you can just kind of spam this around huh seems like it
[21368.52s -> 21376.76s]  okay have you seen any boxes yet uh that's the drawback engineer 45 less boxes no loot
[21378.60s -> 21384.73s]  only lucky shrines in play can you throw them okay you can you can kind of toss them a little bit
[21391.43s -> 21398.71s]  nice all right well don't forget to put down your teleporter and dispenser
[21399.19s -> 21413.69s]  will do and also sell my unusual for real money is there one box on the whole level
[21415.00s -> 21419.08s]  uh there have been zero boxes i'm in favor of just restarting let's just redo it
[21419.08s -> 21437.74s]  i go to hell let's do it again because that was dumb though we also were playing around with the
[21437.74s -> 21446.12s]  move set yeah but like i didn't open well i didn't see one box you can attach mines to germa hey check
[21446.12s -> 21453.98s]  your steam man turrets also get the effects of your items that sounds insane hold on stand still
[21453.98s -> 21463.05s]  how much damage does the shield mitigate oh you all right go all right i'm gonna go
[21464.25s -> 21472.22s]  i'm going for it wait let me do that to you here oh yeah hitting airborne enemies is miserable
[21473.50s -> 21482.57s]  all right we're supposed to restart dude no don't oh my god let me die oh it bounces my own bubbles
[21482.57s -> 21502.22s]  what about from in not from inside give me some stuff active what is it slug flight
[21502.22s -> 21517.56s]  i feel like that would be okay i miss my movement ability i just do hover guy at least i never get
[21517.56s -> 21526.70s]  my feet wet flying mines why would you put it just carpet like drop all right what the
[21526.70s -> 21539.10s]  fuck is hitting me stupid elite oh fuck off those things are so good come on right into my mind
[21539.90s -> 21545.77s]  come on can you stick a mind to yourself oh no that's what's going on your minds are blowing up
[21546.41s -> 21549.70s]  it's because you're throwing up more okay that was just freaking me out i was like why what's
[21549.70s -> 21553.78s]  going on to me what's happening my character yeah i guess you can only have like 10 at a time
[21555.10s -> 21571.26s]  uh period i found the portal so they activate pretty quickly so question the things like bleed
[21571.26s -> 21579.74s]  and such stack with your turret uh area items stack with your turrets apparently mushroom is
[21579.82s -> 21590.10s]  super good i don't know which one of these to pick yes they do so i don't have a move i can
[21590.10s -> 21602.74s]  stop from her getting hurt from falling uh good question i don't think you do the turrets can
[21602.74s -> 21608.30s]  proc bleed sticky bomb everything fungus is overpowered on turrets because they just heal
[21608.30s -> 21615.66s]  infinitely that's kind of cool so as fungus what is the slug is that fungus engineer does not have
[21615.66s -> 21629.67s]  any mobility movements okay good to know sluggish heal out of combat okay okay let me look for chests
[21630.39s -> 21640.57s]  yeah i can fly with this i can't just forget i have it how much was this one this class seems fun
[21643.74s -> 21651.91s]  everybody who's saying it's boring well that's probably used to just a hater i can see that
[21651.91s -> 21656.57s]  though because you really only have one move you can really even do you can like i feel like i
[21656.57s -> 21663.54s]  only have one move with multi this card it's kind of hard to hit this too
[21664.26s -> 21684.50s]  if it's a boss probably uh you want to get it started what are you fighting over here i just
[21684.50s -> 21694.95s]  like shooting the like burst of uh of little bombs and let's activate this thing engineer is the boss
[21694.95s -> 21717.53s]  killer oh gold per bullet the crowd funder gotta get more money i'll try this there's a gun on my
[21717.53s -> 21733.05s]  gun probably that didn't work sword do it again and shields do you have an active i do i have
[21733.05s -> 21742.57s]  the money gun uh we gotta get this rolling all right we gotta go we gotta go we do have to go
[21752.92s -> 21756.84s]  where i think i found it already what the hell was it yeah it's it's like right over here i think
[21757.64s -> 21766.36s]  at least i thought i did so right i'm just gonna stop at the luck shrine or some quick gambling
[21776.57s -> 21784.33s]  anything else no all right i'm ready let's go preemptively put down turrets
[21785.21s -> 21789.78s]  how long do the turrets last for though i don't know wait how many can you put down two two
[21790.58s -> 21803.14s]  oh you missed your turrets but don't worry i got them you can stick it to people too oh that's cool
[21805.70s -> 21814.39s]  all right what does the money gun do oh ow ow it's shooting all my bullets all my money
[21815.03s -> 21832.17s]  okay where's the other guy hey repair your torch where's the other wasps isn't there where's the
[21832.17s -> 21847.45s]  other boss greater west where is it uh he's flying somewhere i guess uh okay oh
[21848.17s -> 21854.25s]  i just got air shot twice shielding the bad guy why do the bad guys have a shield i'm gonna die
[21854.97s -> 21870.86s]  because oh my god give me a break where is this boss what i don't know but we still have to do
[21870.86s -> 21880.70s]  the teleporter anyways we'll sit here no he's not what he's back here he's like blending in
[21880.70s -> 21901.05s]  with the grass okay they're dead okay okay we can proceed all right turn invisible on taking heavy
[21901.05s -> 21913.82s]  damages behind me there for you i'm gonna die where are you i just kind of flew up here to go
[21913.82s -> 21922.33s]  look for boxes i use my hover jets which i feel like is not a very good invention considering how
[21922.33s -> 21929.45s]  big they are and they can only get me one foot off the ground did i spend all my money with my
[21929.45s -> 21937.72s]  q gun i don't think i have any boxes over here this is an active how do you turn it off well
[21937.72s -> 21942.84s]  hey if you want a box i'm standing right next to one i think i found two boxes over here this money
[21942.84s -> 21948.89s]  gun is a trap i don't know if that is but it's mine the crystal yeah i don't have any money so
[21948.89s -> 21954.94s]  it's all yours um okay i just picked up something called the crowd funder yeah that's what it made
[21954.94s -> 21961.75s]  me go broke oh i have that that's the thing that sucks yeah well i don't know if it sucks but it
[21961.75s -> 21970.46s]  steals all your money so don't get it how do you turn it off once it starts using your money
[21973.34s -> 21977.18s]  yeah i toggle i toggle it off after the first time i used it apparently it didn't nothing that
[21977.18s -> 21984.89s]  didn't happen hey germa i was hoping i could be the one guy you're cute and bad in the game
[21984.89s -> 21992.71s]  i appreciate 50 percent of that comment all right where's this buck you talking about
[21993.27s -> 22004.57s]  it's like way over there i'm looking scanning there it is uh hopefully you don't kill don't
[22004.57s -> 22016.41s]  kill me don't kill me don't kill me how long is this wing's last four not that god damn all right
[22016.41s -> 22021.29s]  uh we can you just press the button and get us out of here otherwise why am i is it still on
[22021.29s -> 22025.45s]  it you definitely can't talk it off by pushing q chat it's still spending money literally as
[22025.45s -> 22030.41s]  fast as i can get it you can't turn it off i'm hitting he's just rising
[22034.09s -> 22040.73s]  you can't turn off the money gun no i think the money gun just always siphons money
[22041.61s -> 22045.29s]  i think this run is over somebody said you can turn it off i don't know what he's doing
[22046.17s -> 22059.86s]  what it's really easy you just push q chat see money gun sometimes it doesn't want to go off
[22059.86s -> 22078.30s]  though see like it glows when i shoot grab your item before i delete it thank you you left my
[22078.30s -> 22092.62s]  minds behind why did i let you have that i don't know why you didn't press it that's why i saw i
[22092.62s -> 22116.55s]  was like he's not gonna press it is he okay that was my poor teleporter the mines seem pretty
[22116.55s -> 22133.34s]  effective hello give me money 57 come on oh it's right here found it you want to try to kill it
[22133.34s -> 22136.94s]  now well there's no enemies here what are you talking about that found the teleporter it's
[22136.94s -> 22146.09s]  right here oh uh maybe spawns or anything we just try to kill it right now just kind of smoke it and
[22146.09s -> 22161.94s]  then be able to run around uh let me grab one item on the way to you okay i'm running all right
[22161.94s -> 22184.34s]  just don't push q do not push you drop it i don't think i can the queen kill it we have two shields
[22184.34s -> 22204.78s]  is better than one anybody that gets in here is gonna get mine well we are shredding bosses
[22205.42s -> 22215.05s]  well you kind of had to do that though we've run out of time all right we got boxes few boxes
[22215.05s -> 22220.60s]  maybe wait are you supposed to be able to charge your uh gun while sprinting that seems like
[22221.56s -> 22226.44s]  maybe something you're not supposed to be able to do i don't know but you total fyi you can left
[22226.44s -> 22235.83s]  click then sprint but the game doesn't want you to know that okay i've got a kiosk over here
[22236.39s -> 22249.99s]  just looking around okay see item that way this way you kind of just stand here huh we do have
[22249.99s -> 22255.93s]  to literally just stand here did i pick up that item what is this did you get yours already
[22255.93s -> 22269.19s]  yeah i got mine it's just the invisible thing again all right we're good all right there's
[22269.19s -> 22288.81s]  something over here why am i doing that i don't know this one attack speed that's kind of good
[22288.81s -> 22311.93s]  come on down there two down here beautiful slow enemies no one they really stuffed them back here
[22311.93s -> 22325.02s]  huh all right how you doing uh i found a couple chests nothing that's gonna make the run i see
[22325.02s -> 22336.31s]  one i can't even get to up there i'll get that one all right pray for me what are you gonna do
[22336.87s -> 22348.18s]  this three oh you can fly one liftoff uh what the hell is this don't go outside it's a lunar it
[22348.18s -> 22354.04s]  needs a coin needs a lunar coin all right let's get out of here that is dumb quick quick dude hurry
[22354.04s -> 22363.35s]  up you gotta tap as fast you can jump down this hole weirdly enough i didn't take any damage why
[22363.91s -> 22372.66s]  this is the slowest character in the game so far are you ready for me to press this
[22373.30s -> 22382.49s]  yeah so how did i not take any damage may as well have used my money gun there's a chest
[22390.30s -> 22407.00s]  all right find it there i feel like mines that are underpowered find it come on lag what's going
[22407.00s -> 22425.80s]  on with that lag some of these annoying things is hanging out here well turrets are pretty awesome
[22427.10s -> 22457.18s]  they really are this view oh a kiosk what do we got oh we got oh we got uh this one uh found the
[22458.06s -> 22464.09s]  thing we're looking for i don't teleport you know mines are good up people stand on boss fights
[22464.09s -> 22467.61s]  because you can just slap them on there and it's pretty much as impossible to miss
[22469.05s -> 22485.56s]  true there's extra damage 266 this character is kind of fucking insane yeah it seems that way
[22486.44s -> 22492.82s]  uh it's right here oh nice another equipment charge for my money gun that i do not want
[22501.13s -> 22518.49s]  sticky bombs all right how you doing uh started hanging out looking at the meter about to switch
[22518.49s -> 22534.78s]  to very hard in a moment yeah that's what i was thinking attack speed again cool i feel like the
[22534.78s -> 22539.96s]  teleporter is always in that same spot on this level it's always like kind of back here isn't it
[22544.58s -> 22558.10s]  you ready yeah i think i'm already come to me one second it's 260 i'm pretty much here all right
[22558.10s -> 22563.78s]  you want to you got what do you cooldowns look like uh everything is refreshed and ready to go
[22563.78s -> 22585.61s]  all right here we go it is the imp overlord where are you there you are turrets are getting
[22585.61s -> 22597.98s]  beasted on now yes they are fly away maybe not let me just stay in here there's a fucking cow
[22597.98s -> 22605.96s]  in here with me all right i gotta get the fuck out of there well we're doing a lot of uh oh
[22606.68s -> 22613.42s]  she's not happy oh man i'm dead she's not happy with my turret spot god damn it just couldn't
[22613.42s -> 22631.77s]  really get out of it yeah he teleported on top of me oh dear yeah he that's what he did to me
[22645.24s -> 22657.64s]  money gun money money money money nothing bad can happen in here right oh boy you're in trouble
[22658.36s -> 22668.78s]  turtle inside the crate the classic strategy well i spent all my money but you know what
[22669.42s -> 22673.26s]  i forgot that it happens when i left click money gun is the worst on this because you have to charge
[22673.26s -> 22721.30s]  up hide this is surprisingly functional and i got some money back super jump
[22725.66s -> 22735.85s]  okay all right you've had your fun i just need this one chest risk of turtling
[22736.57s -> 22744.49s]  sometimes hey you gotta do what you gotta do i am playing we are playing the engineer
[22744.49s -> 22764.26s]  yeah it's not like we're playing um the gunslinger oh sorry all right let's get out of here slowly
[22764.26s -> 22773.32s]  this is level three this is uh i think so so advancing before insane i think is pretty decent
[22775.05s -> 22788.22s]  fairly lukewarm fairly lukewarm fairly like lukewarm into average somebody said read this
[22788.22s -> 22796.81s]  comment you got it no no i did and there's a super chest here no i did there's a there's a
[22796.81s -> 22803.99s]  super chest 3300 bucks keep in mind all right it wasn't worth the last time it didn't seem like it
[22805.96s -> 22816.28s]  would it be worth it this time hey new active i'm just gonna stand here until i get 200 bucks to
[22816.28s -> 22831.85s]  switch it over which may never happen do i need how much uh the that that first chest has fungus
[22832.65s -> 22836.73s]  and apparently we can just have infinite fungus and have our turrets never die
[22838.07s -> 22843.59s]  that is what i have heard that is currently what chat just simply can't stop talking about it
[22843.59s -> 22849.35s]  so so excited so fungus you will you want me to 3d print all my stuff how much fungus should i get
[22850.31s -> 22865.91s]  i'll take the fungus i'll take the fungus i'll take the fungus all right who the
[22865.91s -> 22880.02s]  fuck is doing this to me let me alone exclamation fungus get like five you done
[22880.74s -> 22886.65s]  uh i'm getting like i'm getting like how much do i have five i'll get i'll get seven i'm waiting
[22886.65s -> 22896.14s]  for my turn at the fungus uh machine all right i'm done are you sure have fun stay away from my
[22896.14s -> 22902.12s]  fungus no no what do you know yeah i thought you guys didn't everyone just say get like between five
[22902.12s -> 22908.92s]  to ten you mean like five too much back up did i pick it up did i take yours no this is my fungus
[22908.92s -> 22917.99s]  all right have fun with your fungus seven is not too much okay well just get a fruit we gotta do
[22917.99s -> 22927.78s]  the meme build i mean we just have to stand in one spot and have our turrets do everything it's a
[22927.78s -> 22932.42s]  self-fulfilling prophecy everyone's like this is the most boring clash it's because when i find the
[22932.42s -> 22940.78s]  fungus machine oh my god okay everything for ultimate fungus build that's a huge huge area
[22941.50s -> 22947.99s]  and if we have four of these and we can stand still all right i have nine fungus you have nine
[22947.99s -> 22953.85s]  i got seven so if we stack our turrets one on top of the other okay um what the fuck is killing me
[22953.85s -> 22960.71s]  right now did you pick this up what is this what what is what is going on with the fire damage in
[22960.71s -> 22965.59s]  this game i don't know it's kind of crazy just put down a turret all right let's go find the thing
[22966.39s -> 22970.55s]  and then just stand on top of our turrets just stand let's create an aura of healing turrets
[22971.19s -> 23000.20s]  it's over here where it's over there oh what happens if you go all the way up here
[23001.35s -> 23012.02s]  oh how do you get down it's a good question what's in here okay we've got if i jump from
[23012.02s -> 23021.85s]  this height am i going to be dead be careful this seems dangerous i don't i can't i don't
[23021.85s -> 23026.49s]  know what's happening but this seems really really really powerful i think we found the
[23026.49s -> 23032.25s]  build that we're both going to have to uh beat the game with all right where's that mask
[23034.14s -> 23043.18s]  wow the aoe is gigantic after killing three where's the uh teleport going to a friend
[23043.90s -> 23053.74s]  teleport is very fine oh let's activate it all right let's ready put down your shit make sure
[23053.74s -> 23057.02s]  we make sure you put them in the same spot so we can all get like we can stack on us
[23057.02s -> 23065.24s]  it's the magma worm dude this is i am i playing overwatch that's what i feel like i feel like
[23065.24s -> 23071.90s]  this is eight you are now so who said we'd be unkillable because one of my friends is already
[23071.90s -> 23084.41s]  dead you liars stand well you have to stand still too right do i stand still i think i'm invincible
[23084.41s -> 23088.73s]  i think we all stand still oh my god okay no no wait wait that's probably not a good idea is it
[23088.73s -> 23097.32s]  a good idea we should stand still stand still right next to each other um i don't know if i
[23097.32s -> 23108.50s]  like this it feels a little terrifying yeah i'm taking a lot of damage uh yeah oh my god we didn't
[23108.50s -> 23112.66s]  plan this we didn't plan this good enough we had we should have stuck on top of each other okay
[23113.38s -> 23129.38s]  i'm here here's a shield i'm gonna stand still now here's my turret okay good yeah magma worm
[23129.38s -> 23136.74s]  probably is not what was intended this is overwatch with mods this is just remember when
[23136.74s -> 23143.06s]  they used to do the arcade mode yeah well that sucks oh you've got to be kidding me
[23143.06s -> 23152.28s]  what just fucking happened right there i'm flying you are you serious right now what was i got
[23152.28s -> 23160.12s]  another turd in we have four turrets now i hope that they can do good deep so why is fire damage
[23160.12s -> 23167.66s]  like times 500 times damage you're dead no i'm almost dead i'm coming back into the heels the
[23167.66s -> 23181.61s]  delicious heels i'm healed i gotta hold still it's bug if any one of us panics and like runs away
[23182.73s -> 23187.85s]  it's like we're breaking the herd immunity oh the devs know it's broken oh fire is actually broken
[23187.85s -> 23192.49s]  like it's a broken mechanic oh like it's actually like actually like they're patching it because
[23192.49s -> 23198.36s]  it's broken okay well that makes sense i was gonna say what the fuck you like see look at that
[23199.08s -> 23204.71s]  are you dead you did yeah you just you just healed through like dying how are you dead
[23204.71s -> 23212.89s]  because he launched me across the whole game and i died to fire damage i didn't realize i was alone
[23212.89s -> 23217.69s]  in this he knocked me in the air and put a dot on me and it was doing like 200 damage a tick
[23217.69s -> 23226.90s]  and then i died from the fall all the turrets are getting healed too oh that was bad that was a nasty
[23226.90s -> 23236.07s]  one you did it did i hey i did it now where's that legendary chest uh how much money do you have
[23237.43s -> 23246.12s]  slow enemies on hit that's probably good uh 3043 that's not enough i think it's 37 what was the
[23246.12s -> 23252.68s]  required amount i think it was 37 was 34 80 all right i'm just gonna pick up like this one thing
[23252.68s -> 23267.91s]  and then come back you need 300 more i believe these are green feathers a jump right
[23268.71s -> 23281.37s]  this game's fucking bonkers always go with the random item could be anything all right
[23281.93s -> 23287.59s]  is that all there is for me to get uh well yeah i think so unless you want to do the challenge
[23287.59s -> 23306.14s]  mode right there that's okay surprisingly little to pay for over this way turrets are still having
[23306.14s -> 23315.34s]  a good old time so wait if i die my turrets just stay there uh yes that's strange they do indeed
[23316.06s -> 23325.18s]  all right well ready to fight another day so i feel like that strategy will work on every other boss
[23325.82s -> 23335.18s]  now if unless they can one chunk you yeah if they can hit like kill you in one that's 120 120
[23336.22s -> 23346.95s]  that's 120 times six so that's how much help is strong enough to actually kill things quickly
[23346.95s -> 23354.10s]  yeah let's uh clean up quickly did you just eat those is he eating these
[23355.30s -> 23361.22s]  excuse me i would like to ask a question is there a reason why he i can't hit this guy
[23364.62s -> 23378.17s]  what what are you eating that was weird that was strange he was just inhaling them let's go
[23378.17s -> 23389.94s]  over here minimum arming distance probably something like that something weird they're not killing
[23389.94s -> 23404.25s]  them fast enough oh i got a slug too and even more attack speed so this is back to level one
[23404.25s -> 23418.04s]  right i believe so the level one loop wow that hurt oh it's a fire guy wow i got super slow on
[23418.04s -> 23446.47s]  him let's get away from me you can only i can only do oh this is there's a boss up here it's
[23446.47s -> 23464.20s]  like one of those boss characters all right any sign of the uh thing uh not yet yeah that's like
[23465.08s -> 23470.84s]  there's four or five of those oh my i mean it's not a boss but it's one of the boss those boss
[23470.84s -> 23476.79s]  characters and you fight five of them at the same time right what if i turn this on and didn't even
[23476.79s -> 23482.97s]  tell them what are you doing i'm not going to do that this is our first like actual reel we might
[23482.97s -> 23491.21s]  actually beat the loop maybe i'll uh come down to you because we don't want to get to haha level
[23491.21s -> 23508.18s]  when we do this probably this like feels like i shouldn't be doing this but i it's just so
[23508.18s -> 23513.90s]  counterproductive to move it's counterproductive strange it feels so weird that's how i feel every
[23513.90s -> 23540.38s]  day chest nice oh any sign of it uh i don't think so oh yeah here it is ready no no way we let we
[23540.38s -> 23544.38s]  need to we need to like get this situated we need to be ready we have to be in the same spot i only
[23544.38s -> 23550.73s]  have one turret available okay here's one two i'm standing here and i have five seconds for the next
[23551.69s -> 23556.98s]  okay are you ready to stand still three becomes my last one here we go we have to activate this
[23556.98s -> 23572.47s]  before we get to ha ha ha okay so it's just this thing just stand still and spam am i hitting them
[23572.47s -> 23580.92s]  my own what the fuck why what was that was that his i don't know what was just happening i only had
[23580.92s -> 23590.84s]  one portal down now you've got a no but why was it bouncing what a what a pro strat this is oh and
[23590.84s -> 23599.85s]  then you fly as long as you don't fly too far here he comes he's gonna step on us now oh that
[23599.85s -> 23606.49s]  hurts i'm so scared i feel like i should need to move i'm on top of them one down one to go
[23608.14s -> 23613.90s]  we're not even in ha ha ha land yet this is fucking the rancho relax strategy
[23616.58s -> 23618.89s]  this really is like the meme build
[23619.37s -> 23632.01s]  um where is he over there where's the other actual i can't see there's too many fucking
[23632.01s -> 23636.49s]  rhinos too much green goo there's too many winstons on our team i don't know where we are
[23641.13s -> 23651.05s]  it works until it doesn't is this trap yeah that's true any where is the actual bus we got to 99
[23651.05s -> 23658.04s]  charge i'm gonna move i know that's not allowed really you are moving okay fine let's go let's
[23658.04s -> 23666.36s]  find him uh is that him over there yeah it's him all the way down there all right move we're
[23666.36s -> 23672.66s]  gonna pick up shop we're gonna do the same thing over here uh oh uh oh gotta get some heal babies
[23672.66s -> 23702.30s]  down oh we're separated um we should be okay your shield is deflecting all my attacks all right i'm
[23702.30s -> 23711.90s]  moving up moving it why to you because i was behind you plus we heal each other we did it we
[23711.90s -> 23720.38s]  did it now all right pick up the pieces now just maybe a few more items we just got to ha ha ha
[23720.38s -> 23727.51s]  difficulty we did all right there's a ukulele here for you oh yeah i'll get that on the way
[23728.47s -> 23740.52s]  out boxes all right we're in ha ha ha we this is we have one more after this right i think so
[23740.52s -> 23748.20s]  so the ideology here is to get to the portal as fast as possible and do our impenetrable fort
[23748.20s -> 23751.80s]  yeah before it gets too far down the ha ha ha tree i don't i don't see any loot so i'm just
[23751.80s -> 23754.68s]  gonna come to the thing by the teleporter yeah let's just get the hell out of here we'll level
[23754.68s -> 23768.33s]  up a few times let me grab my boss gear it's right here and let's get the hell out of here
[23770.74s -> 23780.06s]  oh right that way i got some good max hp all right tactic go find as fast as possible
[23780.95s -> 23797.77s]  find the teleporter and then set up shop and let's get out of this let's do it good tactic
[23797.77s -> 23813.30s]  i like being up here and we can see down i don't see any particles what's hurting me what's hurting
[23813.30s -> 23825.96s]  me what is hurting oh did i go out of bounds you can go out of bounds in this game yes watch for
[23825.96s -> 23841.50s]  the red rope all the way around the edge keep gotta keep looking here so far i got nothing
[23842.22s -> 23853.64s]  it's over here it's being blocked by a titan no my god are you gonna be okay i don't know
[23853.64s -> 23861.99s]  what is that rp talk like i don't know i just don't know what's that oh um oh i think uh this
[23861.99s -> 23874.33s]  thing yep slug okay it's right up here all right are you ready sorry i got the correct
[23874.33s -> 23879.37s]  hall's goat hoof for move faster i don't know why you would need anything that useless oh god
[23880.33s -> 23888.44s]  we gotta get over to that thing where is it it's over here oh fuck we gotta do the strategy
[23888.44s -> 23893.72s]  we're useless without the strategy oh yeah definitely ready i'm on it i don't know where
[23893.72s -> 23901.00s]  you are come to me ping oh i got it pink okay you know where we are close yeah i'm just gonna
[23901.00s -> 23906.84s]  i'm starting strategy a oh god i'm like left behind in the zombie apocalypse i'm coming
[23907.80s -> 23914.20s]  this is oh my god i need you i'm here i need you i need your other heel all right i'm gonna stand
[23914.20s -> 23921.05s]  still oh jesus they've breached all right press the button one of the engineer turrets is dead
[23923.66s -> 23934.36s]  oh my god it's too spiky damage is too spiky hold on have faith hold i bought us some time with with
[23934.36s -> 23951.51s]  my uh oh it's totally dead well we did hold the line we will definitely get some kind of metal
[23951.51s -> 23965.03s]  for that i think god damn it why uh it works until it didn't that was so long uh what time is it
[23966.95s -> 23979.13s]  11 seven hours oh yeah that's so unfortunate not much else we can unlock except you'd have
[23979.13s -> 23985.75s]  to get the 10 points which would probably take like a few hours obliterate yourself at the obelisk
[23985.75s -> 23994.57s]  is that the like you beat all the things guy i think that you that's when we beat that i think
[23994.57s -> 24005.50s]  we go to the obelisk i don't even know what killed us what even did that much damage that was just a
[24005.50s -> 24014.98s]  it was like it was just an explosion yeah seven stage is the portal option for obliteration that
[24014.98s -> 24020.58s]  unlocks a character that's cool there's three greater wisps shooting at the same time a beetle
[24020.58s -> 24030.41s]  queen bomb oh well that was fun yeah that was fun for something in early access that just came
[24030.41s -> 24038.34s]  at early access randomly for just there it is uh that was good yep and there's still two more
[24038.34s -> 24046.10s]  characters and i guess four more to be added and i'm going to 20 bucks fairly reasonable as well
[24046.10s -> 24057.29s]  i would obviously we'll probably see much more content yeah added in the coming months yeah it's
[24057.29s -> 24062.81s]  good stuff no that was cool it's really smooth the only complaint really i had was the like the fire
[24062.81s -> 24068.97s]  damage but that's apparently a bug so yeah the uh it's just really addictive getting like a super
[24068.97s -> 24085.42s]  build yeah that's fun and the co-op seems smooth i think we can disband the squad what happens if i
[24085.42s -> 24093.29s]  do this i'm still in the squad oh you're still in the squad you're never going to leave the squad
[24093.29s -> 24102.94s]  i'm i'll always be in the squad rip squad but uh anyways that there was risk of rain two co-op
[24102.94s -> 24109.62s]  that was italics go say hello go get him a follow oh if you haven't already i was like where is he
[24109.62s -> 24119.85s]  uh you're here yeah we're at i'm sorry to say this but we're disbanding the squad yeah we're
[24119.85s -> 24131.21s]  gonna um cut the house in two and draw just a big line down the middle the squad but yeah thanks
[24131.21s -> 24139.64s]  for playing after the microwave gets caught then it's always a pleasure mr italics end of squad

[24147.86s -> 24154.81s]  all right well thanks for having me guys i've been told i've been very loud i'm sorry that's not my
[24154.81s -> 24162.94s]  fault i turned you down i've been told i'm turned down very quiet not my fault i did i hold on but
[24162.94s -> 24169.26s]  if i could do it over again i would be even louder i tried i turned him down he was i got confirmation
[24169.26s -> 24180.68s]  that you were fine that would be at least twice as loud what if i had the choice i i we talked
[24180.68s -> 24190.81s]  about it like two hours three hours ago and they were like turned down a little i turned you down
[24190.81s -> 24201.03s]  good night guys see you next time so wait was he really loud that whole time because it on my end
[24201.03s -> 24211.61s]  it looks like he was fine the first couple hours oh he was fine oh they just you just fucking around
[24211.61s -> 24219.85s]  okay i know for the first couple hours i think he was a little loud but i uh i turned him down
[24219.85s -> 24225.50s]  halfway through all right come on man you guys are making me feel crazy but that's it
[24226.58s -> 24232.86s]  i let me get this off the screen here i will see you guys tomorrow for the sakiro scratch off if
[24232.86s -> 24246.90s]  you don't know what that is tomorrow i'm going to be scratching 221 dollars worth of scratch tickets
[24246.90s -> 24258.10s]  for every every dollar every death in sakiro it's going to be just to hang out just stream any scent
[24258.10s -> 24265.13s]  that is made through that i've picked the charity i'm going to be using that i'm going to be donating
[24266.55s -> 24286.86s]  now the charity is going to be the nevada humane society very highly rated charity and regardless
[24286.86s -> 24294.95s]  of how much money is made on that stream at least 221 dollars is going to go to the nevada humane
[24294.95s -> 24308.02s]  society because if i get zero dollars on these tickets that don't matter if it's 50 grand
[24309.24s -> 24321.62s]  beautiful and then after that to keep in line with the gambling thing uh i'm gonna make sure
[24321.62s -> 24331.77s]  that it works it should somebody made a germa slots game that is a full game that has a bunch
[24331.77s -> 24348.47s]  of mini games in it it's like a full experience and we're gonna play it should be an interesting

[24412.86s -> 24421.48s]  say if it's a 20 ticket you get that the chance to win is much higher but i really have no idea
[24421.48s -> 24436.94s]  what the maximum is i don't know oh let's be right back that's incorrect hey there we go the ticket
[24436.94s -> 24445.91s]  will say the max price on it yeah it should it should but uh it won it won we thanks to the five

[24974.07s -> 24986.28s]  not i mean it's like it is but it isn't gambling streamer do i have does that mean i have to go
[24986.28s -> 25002.86s]  into the category on stream the gambling casino category uh do i i think i do this be irl opening
[25002.86s -> 25015.16s]  loot boxes the name of that title of that stream should be germa bare minimum loses 442 dollars
[25019.27s -> 25034.92s]  put it in the secure category that's fucking hilarious uh but here come the credits thank
[25034.92s -> 25043.10s]  you to all the subs see if you can see your name it's gonna be blown by here in a second
[25046.26s -> 25054.82s]  put it under dwarf fortress why would i put it in dwarf fortress don't you still need to pay
[25054.82s -> 25060.82s]  income tax on lotto winnings no i don't think so because i was talking about this uh with a
[25060.82s -> 25069.93s]  few people casino winnings are just taxed i don't think they count as income so let's okay if i
[25069.93s -> 25077.54s]  win a million dollars on a scratch ticket i believe a portion of that like 20 to 30 percent of that
[25077.54s -> 25090.52s]  is just taxed i don't think it counts as income on my like tax return is a lottery ticket income
[25096.73s -> 25105.08s]  are gambling winnings income gambling winnings are fully taxable and you must report the income
[25105.08s -> 25109.56s]  on your tax return gambling income includes but is not limited to winning some lotteries raffles
[25109.56s -> 25118.23s]  casinos includes cash winnings income is it how do gambling winnings affect if your winnings
[25118.23s -> 25123.99s]  are reported on a form w2g federal taxes are withheld at a flat rate of 25 percent
[25124.71s -> 25135.66s]  okay but does that mean we'll fucking figure it out i'm pretty certain that if i win a million
[25135.66s -> 25147.85s]  dollars on a ticket tomorrow 250 000 is goes to the irs and then that's just it that's i
[25147.85s -> 25158.89s]  believe that's correct i don't think that affects my actual like income for 2019 and then okay so
[25158.89s -> 25166.87s]  that's gonna be strange so okay if i take in let's say it does affect income so if i win a million
[25166.87s -> 25171.43s]  dollars on a scratch ticket and it affects income okay you know so you made you made a million
[25171.43s -> 25188.23s]  dollars in 2019 and you donated 750 000 to charity i'm gonna have to like i'm fairly certain that's
[25188.23s -> 25194.63s]  not how it works donations are deductible so what i had like i had 750 000 dollars in expenses in
[25194.63s -> 25209.34s]  2019 just mail them the ticket they'll deal with it win the money then go to h&r block on stream
[25209.34s -> 25220.34s]  and say what do i do by the way this is assuming that i'm going to win a million dollars on this
[25220.34s -> 25229.48s]  what like a gambling fallacy i'll be lucky if i win like 100 bucks tomorrow but there's a
[25229.48s -> 25234.52s]  possibility that i could win like 50 grand and then 50 grand that goes right to the nevada
[25235.08s -> 25249.91s]  humane society what if you win one dollar it gets rounded up to 221 double or nothing after
[25249.91s -> 25262.22s]  tomorrow's stream i know people are already going to be saying that i'm not going to do
[25262.94s -> 25266.86s]  a like scratching for sakiro deaths and then whatever is won for charity
[25267.66s -> 25277.45s]  and win nine dollars and send nine dollars i mean like it's we're doing like a whole event here for
[25277.45s -> 25284.78s]  this like i'm gonna do at least 200 i'm gonna give at least 221 dollars don't even worry i'm
[25284.78s -> 25294.71s]  look i am going i'm gonna hit like a thousand dollars tomorrow just watch i'm gonna hit like
[25294.71s -> 25305.50s]  fucking two or three grand on these tickets tomorrow but anyways i got one more bit to do
[25305.50s -> 25318.55s]  we got one more that uh trickled in here and it was who was it it was something or other thanks
[25318.55s -> 25325.53s]  to the 250 it's a terrible day for rain remember to bring your umbrella i never have an umbrella
