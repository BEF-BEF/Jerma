[0.70s -> 14.02s]  Hey, howdy doody. Oh, how diddley do neighbor, right? What's that guy's name? Flanders.
[18.30s -> 26.57s]  We're gonna play more Blitz The League 2 today, because I think it's a great game. It's a lot
[26.57s -> 37.32s]  of fun. Can I build another birdhouse? I think one is enough. I think one birdhouse is a pretty
[37.32s -> 47.45s]  good quota for 10 years. Last time I built a birdhouse, I was probably... I would say every
[47.45s -> 64.60s]  time I get a tetanus shot is when a birdhouse should be built. So, you know, go get a tetanus
[64.60s -> 72.87s]  shot. Now, you know what? I actually think I probably do for one. Oh my... what's going on
[72.87s -> 77.82s]  with this? What's going on with the sub notifications? Oh wait, I heard about this. I heard about
[77.82s -> 83.70s]  this. Yeah, I might have to do... I might have to turn off stream labs. I heard that it's
[83.70s -> 105.88s]  like broken, right? The stream labs. It's intended. Oh, oh my god. Okay, well,
[107.00s -> 121.98s]  that's like... that's more resubs than chat. Welcome to the stream. But yeah, we're gonna
[121.98s -> 126.28s]  play more Blitz The League. And I have something very unfortunate to tell you guys.
[127.00s -> 130.39s]  I know you guys aren't... no one's gonna want to hear this, but I have to say it.
[130.39s -> 140.30s]  Unfortunately, this is one of those weeks where I have a lot of shit to do. The last couple days,
[140.30s -> 147.51s]  I've been doing things. I've been taking care of some stuff. And I gotta do my taxes.
[148.15s -> 157.67s]  I gotta get it done. So, this is pretty much the only stream until like probably Friday or
[157.67s -> 164.42s]  Saturday. Because I gotta get that shit taken care of. So, this is like the week that was
[164.42s -> 174.36s]  gonna be kind of hard for me to stream that much. So, we'll go for... I'm gonna try to go
[174.36s -> 182.74s]  as long as I can tonight. Just commit tax fraud. No, I gotta make sure I get it right. Every
[182.74s -> 189.29s]  year I take at least a day or two. And it happened to fall. I talked to my CPA and there's
[189.29s -> 195.37s]  a lot of shit that I gotta do and take care of. Because I moved and it's very confusing for me
[195.37s -> 200.25s]  because I live in a different state and I have to file like twice or something. I don't know.
[200.25s -> 205.05s]  It's a lot of random shit that I haven't ever had to deal with before. So, I need to give
[205.05s -> 212.63s]  the time necessary to get it right. So, you'll see me again. The stream's not like over. What
[212.63s -> 217.37s]  am I doing? You'll see me again. Hey, I'll see you right now. This is the play. Here we go.
[217.37s -> 228.30s]  All right. So, I got the ball. Not all. Almost interception. Just don't pay your taxes.
[228.86s -> 238.54s]  That's not how it works. Just don't pay. That's so... That is such bad advice.
[244.23s -> 247.59s]  All right. We're gonna play Blitz League 2, but I want to make do... There's only been one
[247.59s -> 253.67s]  stream this week and I just want to make sure people are prepared for it. Fucking
[253.67s -> 259.98s]  responsibilities. You know, they're being 33. Why can't I... I want to be like 12 again.
[261.75s -> 266.84s]  I didn't have to do taxes when I was 12. I didn't have to like take care. I didn't have to have
[266.84s -> 277.42s]  to have like a repairman. No, I... When I was 12, I just was 12. When I was 12, I wanted to be 33.
[278.14s -> 285.77s]  That's weird how that works. 12-hour stream for a 12-year-old streamer.
[288.73s -> 291.13s]  All right. Did I actually miss the window to press this again?
[294.47s -> 299.24s]  But yeah. I gotta be a good boy and get all my taxes done.
[299.96s -> 310.46s]  And I was trying to find a place to do it and it's always like doing your taxes, especially
[310.46s -> 316.30s]  somebody that gets the kind of income that I get. You know, you just... It's called 1099
[316.30s -> 322.52s]  for those of you that are just curious. I have to do them all myself with the help of obviously
[322.52s -> 327.00s]  like a CPA. So I always... It's always like, all right, I'm gonna do my taxes.
[327.96s -> 331.16s]  Oh, I don't want... I don't wanna. Like I'll do it another day.
[331.88s -> 336.52s]  And then like another like month goes by. No, but I... But I took a time. I can do it like
[336.52s -> 341.16s]  next month. No, you gotta get done. So I have to pick the day that I lock myself
[342.20s -> 351.77s]  in my room for like at least a day or two. And that's tomorrow. So we're gonna pick up. This
[351.77s -> 358.70s]  is the... Unfortunately, this joke doesn't really mean anything anymore because we're
[358.70s -> 368.89s]  Mr. Super Bowl and playing as the Las Vegas Super Bowlers. So that's kind of...
[369.85s -> 380.94s]  It's not gonna really be... That's not funny anymore. I can't edit this team's name either.
[380.94s -> 383.66s]  We can't go in and be like, oh, you know what? I want to change up to like the Las Vegas
[383.66s -> 391.32s]  Dealers. What it should have been. But I listened to the one guy twice for the name of
[391.32s -> 399.59s]  the character and the name of the team. Your mom is so stupid she brought cereal to the Super
[399.59s -> 407.35s]  Bowl. Get that guy out of here. Talk about my mother like that? Get him out of here. All
[407.35s -> 411.35s]  right. So this is Division two. We just leveled up. We just won the Division three
[411.43s -> 418.78s]  championship. Is there anything we need to do? Somebody's injured. Isn't one of our good players
[418.78s -> 425.85s]  injured? Yeah. Halfback D. Sullivan is out for one more game. Unfortunately, we don't have a
[425.85s -> 430.41s]  good halfback. So that's just the way it is. How much money do I have? It's $17,000.
[431.21s -> 437.98s]  We want to know in Division two. I don't understand how American football is played.
[437.98s -> 443.16s]  Keywell, you don't have to. This game... Take away everything you know about sports.
[444.44s -> 452.22s]  This has just hurt each other the game. Okay. Can you hurt somebody else? If the answer is like,
[452.22s -> 455.90s]  are you like, could you like punch a guy in the face? You could play this game.
[456.46s -> 464.89s]  But hi, Keywell. How you doing? Here comes another beer chug. Yeah. Yeah. You're going
[464.89s -> 468.42s]  to see it like five times. All right. We're going to get our ass kicked here because
[469.22s -> 473.93s]  no, always the best teams are always the ones that I beat without a problem at all.
[477.56s -> 488.38s]  Drunk streamer? What? 1-0 versus the Crossfire. Every time I don't make a bet either. You know
[488.38s -> 492.97s]  what? Let's go all in. Fuck it. I need to win by 19 points. Let's go.
[512.09s -> 513.21s]  Okay. So provoke him.
[516.25s -> 524.84s]  So instead of provoke him, we need to get rid of him. Why is he like an, why is he like an animal?
[524.84s -> 541.80s]  What? Was that a lion? How on earth did this get a sequel? Because it's the best game ever.
[547.10s -> 555.74s]  I'm actually sad that there's not a third one. Hello everybody.
[555.74s -> 563.30s]  It's the Las Vegas Craigsicles. So those of you that weren't here the last stream,
[563.94s -> 568.98s]  you're probably wondering, he's playing a football game. Oh, how cool is that?
[568.98s -> 575.11s]  Well, you're about to find out why that is. No, it ain't not. You will eventually. You'll find out.
[578.63s -> 582.81s]  Why do you have monsters ink colors? Because that's my favorite movie ever made.
[583.77s -> 588.58s]  All right. I'm the safety. This is my main character here is the character that is the
[588.58s -> 598.73s]  character in the campaign. Oh, I didn't get it. And this is why we play this game guys.
[598.73s -> 609.02s]  You're about to find out. It's just a strain. It's just a neck strain. He's got his brain
[609.02s -> 615.93s]  neck. We got to get him out of here. How long was he out for? Yeah. Get the card out here.
[620.54s -> 627.50s]  That wasn't their star player, was it? I don't think it was. Four plays. That's not bad.
[629.69s -> 634.25s]  All right. I got to stay back. No first down. Don't throw up over there. What are you
[634.25s -> 644.30s]  doing? What's wrong with you? So in the top left and top right, you can see a meter
[645.26s -> 648.94s]  and depending on how much media you have, you can do certain things.
[649.42s -> 654.78s]  So when you get a full meter and it says unleashed is when you can really hurt somebody on these.
[654.78s -> 658.62s]  We're talking like broken neck. We're talking snapping their collarbone off. We're talking
[658.62s -> 675.14s]  like awful shit. They didn't get a first down? Okay. We're fourth down. The fourth
[675.14s -> 679.62s]  down right now in inches. We're going to go with like a field goal block.
[680.90s -> 684.50s]  No, no, no, no. Like this. Oh, fuck. What are they doing? They're punting. Shit. Why?
[686.28s -> 697.86s]  Inches. You have to just walk. Not even. All right. Come on, Raymer. Here we go. Watch this shit.
[700.78s -> 711.14s]  Oh no. Who was that? Was that me? Oh, it's just a sprained knee. It's all right.
[712.90s -> 720.34s]  I got it. Don't worry. Sprained knee. More like you are not going to walk again.
[721.69s -> 727.75s]  Holy shit. We haven't seen that one. How is that a sprain?
[729.43s -> 733.38s]  Okay. That guy, was that guy like an important player? I don't think he was.
[737.16s -> 750.62s]  Nobody's here. Nobody's here. Stop him. Stop him. That is such a huge gain. We've just got so
[750.62s -> 758.04s]  many yards. No, and there's also like these weird cheerleaders that did the same animation
[758.04s -> 786.18s]  every time. Somebody cut. Cut. God damn it. That's such horseshit. How? I should have just
[786.18s -> 793.62s]  punched him. It's all right. You got a long way to go. Kick his helmet off. Beat it. Go, go, go, go.
[794.90s -> 802.42s]  Chad is now in re. Oh yeah, that's right. Like don't you should. I think I. Do I have to turn
[802.42s -> 813.06s]  this off? I think I have to turn off the recepts, right? Do I? Get it.
[815.86s -> 824.62s]  How do you not pick up that fumble? Why would I do that? I don't know if it was like a
[824.62s -> 834.78s]  thing that I should do. I don't know. I won't turn it off. I don't know how you
[834.78s -> 838.70s]  catch that ball. That went through four people. Those guys have made it a fucking.
[838.70s -> 841.18s]  That's the end of the first quarter as we're scoreless.
[845.29s -> 853.86s]  How did that happen? I need to see that again. So I got one, two, three, four defenders. I sack
[853.86s -> 861.08s]  him. He gets the ball out and I ghost through this guy. Three people can't stop him from
[861.08s -> 865.30s]  catching that. That's what we call in the fucking. Hey, that's what we call in this
[865.30s -> 881.46s]  industry baloney. Well, it's still four down. Sorry. This is the one. Watch this. All right.
[881.46s -> 895.96s]  Now I can't fuck this up. Why? What the hell? Didn't we give them hand lotion last time?
[901.21s -> 910.49s]  I thought I upgraded their hands. Why am I fumbling every single time? Thankfully,
[910.49s -> 916.94s]  they haven't scored any points. There we go. That's what I'm talking about.
[919.03s -> 924.02s]  All right. It's like it never happened. It never should have happened in the first place.
[931.40s -> 937.64s]  All right. Let's go for a run. I don't want to unleash yet. Not unless I need to.
[944.78s -> 947.90s]  All right. I'm afraid to do like a QB sneak here. We're going to go with a pass.
[957.16s -> 968.04s]  All right. I need to get him. Come on. Speed. I'm unleashing here. How do you stop
[968.04s -> 987.59s]  an unleash? That's impossible. Fuck. Okay. Don't fuck it up. Field goal. Okay. That's enough.
[994.04s -> 1014.57s]  What? How did that not go through? That didn't go through. How is that not going through?
[1023.03s -> 1037.67s]  No good. No good. Bad field goal. What? All right. Stick. Who's the guy I need to be
[1037.67s -> 1043.10s]  looking for? What team are they on? I mean, their team. Are they on offense or defense?
[1043.82s -> 1062.70s]  Not going to happen. So they're on defense. Okay. You got to break all their legs. I'm going to
[1062.70s -> 1083.11s]  score a point. Oh, by the way, I heard that Vinnie hosted me for like 30 seconds or something
[1083.75s -> 1091.08s]  last stream during I think somebody's brain exploding. And then he immediately unhosted
[1091.08s -> 1095.32s]  and went live. So everybody got to see like five seconds of somebody's like brain blowing
[1095.32s -> 1102.82s]  up. And then like Vinnie's stream started. I was when somebody told me that I was fucking
[1102.82s -> 1115.34s]  laughing like something bad happened. Whoa, I got to catch this. Oh, stand up.
[1120.06s -> 1133.70s]  Is Cox be acting up here? Nice. Nice taco bell uniform.
[1144.28s -> 1149.00s]  Oh, I had the ball too. No, why did you say something so funny?
[1154.28s -> 1162.10s]  I didn't use any time. Oh, my God. Taco Bell. The Las Vegas Taco Bell.
[1165.46s -> 1176.54s]  Just patted that guy in the back. The Las Vegas Baja Blasters.
[1178.06s -> 1181.02s]  No, these are the official German 985 colors.
[1181.98s -> 1194.39s]  I wish I was just sitting down there with a hot babe. Oh, shut up.
[1198.65s -> 1209.86s]  I can't. Oh, my God. What? Oh, tell me that wasn't his fucking hell. All right. Come on.
[1214.28s -> 1215.64s]  We got to go for X. Bang.
[1219.40s -> 1223.24s]  Their defense is so good. All right. Fuck it. I'm going for it. Watch this shit.
[1223.24s -> 1228.62s]  What can we do? We got to boot it. I'm going for it.
[1237.62s -> 1242.97s]  The defense is so good. They're too good on defense. I have to play defense as good as they
[1242.97s -> 1250.25s]  are. I have to be as good as they are. The offense looking at first and 30. They're not
[1250.25s -> 1260.02s]  going to get shit. All right. That's fine. Not a significant game.
[1264.90s -> 1270.33s]  He's recovered from his broken ribs. Yeah, that's usually how it happens. Get it.
[1272.92s -> 1285.51s]  I'm going to play defense better than them. 12 is significant, but they still have 18
[1285.51s -> 1292.90s]  yards to go. They're going to kick a field goal here and they're going to miss it.
[1298.57s -> 1301.45s]  Good luck on your field goal attempt because I'm blocking it.
[1303.96s -> 1310.15s]  We're a special field goal block. He's the guy who needs it. He needs close.
[1311.03s -> 1314.12s]  No, they're going for it. Oh, shit. I got to change this.
[1314.12s -> 1324.25s]  I can't believe he got it. He used his unleash. That's why.
[1333.59s -> 1342.06s]  So stupid. Oh, it's all right. One. I thought the AI never goes forward on fourth down.
[1342.06s -> 1347.34s]  You've seen that. Come on. Well, good. Fuck you. You don't get extra point. Now
[1347.34s -> 1373.32s]  I can win the game easily. This is the one. All right. That's such a huge game.
[1373.32s -> 1384.06s]  I need to take a capitalized ization on this. We're going cold smoke. First and goal. It's
[1384.06s -> 1393.14s]  gut check time. How did he even get in here? How did he even get the fuck in here?
[1394.92s -> 1405.22s]  Second and goal. Desperate. Desperate. Here we go. Here I squeezed on his spleen.
[1405.86s -> 1417.19s]  That's it. Good old cocks. Beer chug, right? I don't think that was beer chug,
[1417.19s -> 1437.59s]  but I'll be ahead now. I ain't losing this game. When did I get my own stadium?
[1438.39s -> 1445.66s]  I think I just had one, right? I just had one. Come on. We're the Las Vegas cocks.
[1451.96s -> 1466.49s]  I'll bust his ankle up for the whole year. Broken foot. Bring out the cart.
[1467.70s -> 1477.83s]  See you later. All right. Let's play deep. That was going to give him a new foot.
[1487.08s -> 1494.65s]  End of the quarter. As we reach the end of the third quarter, Las Vegas leads by a point.
[1494.65s -> 1501.61s]  How is that a minor injury? Well, in this universe, I think your limbs just,
[1501.61s -> 1505.77s]  there's like drugs that you inject where it makes your limbs grow back.
[1507.77s -> 1514.87s]  They're down and I get the ball and I will make a touchdown and the game will be
[1514.87s -> 1523.66s]  unreachable and we'll be, we'll be eight and one. All right. Watch this guy number 15.
[1527.05s -> 1528.57s]  Get out of my fucking life.
[1537.56s -> 1538.36s]  And I have an unleash.
[1546.52s -> 1551.77s]  Boomer announcer. Now you're going to punt it. Oh fuck. Somebody has to get back there.
[1551.77s -> 1561.83s]  Get back there. Somebody, anyone, you know, you're like small. Okay. Check it.
[1562.87s -> 1573.32s]  All right. We still have an unleash. I'm so ready for this.
[1574.68s -> 1582.04s]  That's what that is right there. Why would I fake field bill? HB float left down and 30.
[1582.04s -> 1593.78s]  I don't even need them star player and I still have it. So do they though. All right.
[1594.58s -> 1598.52s]  I got to get a touchdown right now. We'll go with a trick play. We're going to do maniac.
[1599.08s -> 1602.20s]  Check that top left corner into the end zone, into the dice
[1603.24s -> 1608.22s]  with an unleashing to do an unleashed catch. What just happened?
[1608.22s -> 1633.77s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on. Hold on. Come on. What happened?
[1642.33s -> 1648.94s]  How did they intercept the ball? I am so confused right now. I can't even like laugh at that.
[1651.38s -> 1657.38s]  I have no replay. Did he steal the handoff?
[1662.76s -> 1669.99s]  He ran into the handoff. I have no fucking idea what happened there.
[1671.19s -> 1689.70s]  I can't believe it. How do you intercept a handoff? Walk it again.
[1694.09s -> 1704.01s]  It's all right. I just need a touchdown and I win the game. Just get a touchdown and the
[1704.01s -> 1708.66s]  game's over. This is a good position to be in. I got two timeouts. I have no meter,
[1708.66s -> 1717.91s]  but that's okay. Just don't fumble the goddamn ball. Okay. Here we go.
[1718.23s -> 1722.71s]  Holy. Good thing he's got insurance. We're going to go intertwine.
[1726.17s -> 1736.26s]  Gets rid of it. Got it. Come on. Come on. Stay up. He's brought down 38 yard line. Las Vegas
[1736.26s -> 1740.26s]  and everyone on the same page there. Okay. I got meter. With a very nice game.
[1741.94s -> 1747.38s]  Just keep it going. First down 30 yards to go. Wall at the 38.
[1747.38s -> 1756.18s]  Looking for room on the right side. Damn it. I got to get it right now. Come on.
[1756.90s -> 1778.09s]  This is it. Right here into the end zone. Recovered in the end zone. That deserves a
[1778.09s -> 1792.70s]  shot of a beer. Look at that. Just get a field goal and I win the game properly. That
[1792.70s -> 1805.64s]  felt good. That one felt good. Seven seconds to get a field goal. That ain't going to happen.
[1812.22s -> 1822.41s]  I got meter. He doesn't. Just get a tackle. Two, one. He's okay. He's got one play.
[1823.05s -> 1827.85s]  He doesn't have an unleash. He has one play. We're just going to do full coverage here.
[1829.99s -> 1835.72s]  Complete. Just coverage. Just lock it down. Man up. I don't care how many yards they get.
[1835.72s -> 1851.96s]  Just stay in the back. See you later. Game over. I win. 14-13. There it is.
[1860.25s -> 1863.29s]  How much money am I going to get for this one? Off to a good start.
[1870.22s -> 1877.03s]  I wagered a lot of money, didn't I? Yeah. Oh well. Oh well. 200 grand.
[1878.39s -> 1884.78s]  I guess that was a really low scoring game, huh? You pulled that one out of your ass and I
[1884.78s -> 1896.38s]  respect that. I tried. Thanks. Watch the movies. These are the team intros.
[1897.18s -> 1901.38s]  When they'd introduce the captain of the team. All right. Tara, what's up?
[1901.38s -> 1905.86s]  Hey there, franchise. I hear you've been asking about me. I think it's time we met
[1905.86s -> 1910.97s]  face to face. Cut scene. See you at the club tonight. Okay. Here we go.
[1913.67s -> 1921.27s]  Damn. You came ready to play. Franchise. You look short for a football player.
[1921.27s -> 1926.55s]  Oh, don't play me. I've got all you'll ever need. I'm sure you do, honey,
[1926.55s -> 1932.31s]  but can you keep up? You'll need to prove it first. Prove it? What are we talking about
[1932.31s -> 1938.63s]  here? Show me what you've got on Sunday. Play hard on that field and you can play hard on mine.
[1938.63s -> 1943.59s]  I like a man who can dish it out. You better be ready. It's gonna get rough.
[1944.39s -> 1952.44s]  God. I'm looking forward to it. So what do I have to do? Franchise must cause an injury
[1952.44s -> 1959.18s]  next game. That's what you want me to do? Go hurt someone. That's how you gain my respect.
[1963.48s -> 1969.93s]  Okay. I think I can handle that. How are we doing on injuries?
[1971.32s -> 1976.86s]  Sullivan is still up for two games. How? He had, he already had, it's already been one game. He had
[1976.86s -> 1987.22s]  medical staff on him. What the hell was that all about? I don't know. I don't think I have
[1987.22s -> 1998.17s]  enough money for anything. 260, 220. I don't have any money. What about drugs? Let's see.
[2000.38s -> 2008.92s]  Generate two stamina. Increases the severity of injuries caused by juiced player. So I'm
[2008.92s -> 2014.76s]  gonna take this and I'm just gonna try to hurt as many. That's a high risk though.
[2015.98s -> 2026.92s]  I can't do the, look at the risk. I can't do it. It's all, it's maxed out right now. Yeah,
[2026.92s -> 2037.03s]  I can't do that. I wish I could get my half back back to, you know, who's the,
[2037.03s -> 2048.20s]  Atlanta 404 is the next team. Just take the legal ones. Take the legal ones.
[2049.80s -> 2069.82s]  All of these are illegal. On the left? It's one of the cheapest over-the-counter drugs.
[2069.82s -> 2086.15s]  Yeah, but I mean, they're gonna be searching my bag. It's illegal. Yeah, but I, so,
[2087.03s -> 2096.52s]  fine. I'll take it. I'll take the legal drug. It says legal. I know, but just because it's legal
[2096.52s -> 2107.30s]  doesn't mean I can do it. They're checking. I just got out of prison. Let's go. Atlanta 404.
[2109.78s -> 2116.04s]  They have insane defense. I'm not betting on this game. They almost have a maxed out defense.
[2125.00s -> 2129.80s]  Next up, we got the Atlanta 404. This team's only been in the league for three years,
[2129.80s -> 2133.40s]  but their defense is so destructive, they've already made it into division two.
[2134.84s -> 2139.88s]  The guy who anchors their defense is Keno Talopa. This guy is a destroyer.
[2139.88s -> 2145.64s]  6'5", 3'40", fast as hell. The son of a bitch's head should be a registered weapon.
[2145.64s -> 2150.52s]  When he hits you, it's like a wrecking ball. Do yourself a favor and keep a safe distance.
[2150.68s -> 2153.88s]  I gotta be aware of this. I gotta be careful.
[2157.30s -> 2166.44s]  Best defense in the league. You're under arrest for buying those groceries legally.
[2169.67s -> 2181.66s]  You just never know. He just launches himself into someone. He probably causes a lot of
[2181.66s -> 2189.99s]  injuries. So, lockdown defense, and they're a defense team. So, I just have to score a
[2189.99s -> 2198.23s]  shitload of points or prevent them from scoring. I get the kickoff. Let's make it happen.
[2198.79s -> 2199.67s]  Watch out for the guy.
[2204.57s -> 2210.58s]  He just hit me so hard, I started to T-pose. This is not going to go well.
[2212.22s -> 2222.14s]  Okay. We're going to go with... I don't want to do pass plays. Jesus!
[2222.62s -> 2225.74s]  Horatious. You gotta wonder how he's going to continue playing after that.
[2226.94s -> 2244.18s]  All right. Plan B. Oh my god. Oh, this is bad.
[2247.64s -> 2260.82s]  That defense is so good. They just knock it out of you. Oh, you fucking idiot. What to
[2260.82s -> 2272.95s]  happen? Okay, I blame that on where my hands were on the controller. I blame where my
[2272.95s -> 2286.30s]  hands were. My, like, cold sweat slippery hands. Jesus Christ. Okay. Well, let's get
[2286.30s -> 2290.94s]  over the fact that I just lost 20% stamina on two people and then got an interception.
[2294.62s -> 2306.06s]  You can't stop them. They can't be stopped. It's gotten unleashed, too. This is really bad.
[2311.80s -> 2326.87s]  I'm so afraid of that. Oh, he's going to unleash and kill somebody.
[2332.97s -> 2348.95s]  Oh no! Thank god you held onto the ball, Cox. That was a full drop kick.
[2357.34s -> 2364.81s]  All right. Well, thank god. How the hell am I going to deal with this?
[2368.70s -> 2386.09s]  Okay. I have to punt it. I have to. I can't go down by 14 points immediately.
[2399.53s -> 2407.22s]  Atlanta's making you look like a CPU. Well, they did have double my stats. So,
[2407.78s -> 2412.62s]  you know, there's only so much you can work with here. I'll sit him in the championship
[2412.62s -> 2438.17s]  and I'll beat him. That's the quarter. That's all right. That's not out of reach.
[2442.73s -> 2447.02s]  I have to hurt somebody, right? I got to impress my new girlfriend.
[2447.99s -> 2461.19s]  Who's gonna get hurt? Huh? How did you catch that ball?
[2464.70s -> 2472.28s]  Hurt him. Come on. Hurt. Damn it. That was an opportunity to hurt him. I didn't get it,
[2472.28s -> 2480.17s]  though. I do have an unleash. It's four down. They're probably gonna punt.
[2481.93s -> 2500.54s]  Yeah. Here's my chance to get it back. Bryant, let's go. I wasn't gonna use it there.
[2504.52s -> 2509.91s]  All right. I need to get a touchdown. I'm gonna go with world record crisscross.
[2510.71s -> 2535.72s]  First down, 30 yards to go. And he's knocked down. Mercury. Deep pass.
[2539.74s -> 2544.78s]  I tried to do an unleash but it wouldn't happen. Fuck. I've got to go for a run.
[2545.74s -> 2574.47s]  I got to unleash run. Good. There it is. No, get up. Get up. You have a broken humorism.
[2578.30s -> 2602.12s]  Just get the field goal. Tag him. Dab. It's like it never happens. All the way back. Great kick.
[2606.62s -> 2612.22s]  Injure. Injure. Injure. Uh-oh. What the fuck happened? Why do they all just freak out?
[2612.22s -> 2614.70s]  They all like... Because I was trying to get... Okay. I see what happened. I was trying to
[2614.70s -> 2629.02s]  get the... I'm trying to get him. Injured. I know. I'm trying. I'm trying to injure somebody.
[2629.02s -> 2636.22s]  I'm afraid to do a blitz but, you know, I'm just gonna stay back.
[2641.66s -> 2649.82s]  Injure. Excuse me? Excuse me? Why did he dive through? Hold on. What was that?
[2651.42s -> 2660.54s]  I fucking dove through him. Look at him. I'm waiting for him. Waiting for him.
[2662.34s -> 2682.14s]  What the hell? Cartoon dog shit. Whatever. I can't believe it just happened.
[2682.30s -> 2688.71s]  And the extra point is good. I got his iframe. He dodge rolled me. He was already in a tackle
[2688.71s -> 2695.64s]  parry. Damn it. I need to... He's gonna get the ball too. I'm gonna have to score a touchdown
[2695.64s -> 2706.38s]  right now. And he has an unleash. Get to the fucking outside. And what am I gonna do with
[2706.38s -> 2719.75s]  this? I wonder if I can get him to burn his unleash. That would be ideal. Cut it. Cut it.
[2719.75s -> 2730.84s]  Cut out. Cut out. All right. Get it. It's okay. Go outside. Out of bounds. No.
[2732.92s -> 2746.10s]  Who is this? Oh, it's Ashley. They'll be all right. Out for six games. Fuck. Okay. I still
[2746.10s -> 2768.44s]  have a chance here. I got timeout after this. Drop middle. Come on. I gotta get this.
[2769.00s -> 2784.01s]  Shit. I got him. Okay. We're gonna fake field goal. Touchdown.
[2810.06s -> 2826.39s]  Uh, oh well. What were you thinking? I don't know. I don't know why I did that. Injury.
[2827.11s -> 2835.24s]  Could have done square. Yeah, but I... Every time I've thrown it to a guy that crosses.
[2835.88s -> 2845.98s]  Just caught my foot. It's extra challenging throwing the guys at three defenders. Injury.
[2847.42s -> 2868.49s]  Damn it. That was such a good hit too. There it is. It's the quarterback too. He's in deep shit.
[2884.42s -> 2892.65s]  That was the painful one. And I have an unleash. So third and 26. Just a minor injury
[2892.65s -> 2901.35s]  to the balls. I don't think so. Not gonna happen. Fourth down. Give me the ball.
[2906.26s -> 2912.06s]  All right. I'm going to play safe here. Just prevent. Oh, God damn it. He's punting it.
[2917.14s -> 2921.67s]  I always think he's going to go for it. And then when it, when he doesn't go for it.
[2925.56s -> 2939.93s]  It's okay. Check it. Why would he not punt on fourth and 20?
[2940.81s -> 2943.13s]  Because this game is insane and they do insane things.
[2944.01s -> 2945.29s]  First down and 30.
[2967.83s -> 2974.57s]  Pretty good mud physics. This game stands up. It does. And so we're back to a tie game.
[2975.61s -> 2988.81s]  No, I actually forget the beer jug code. I think it's XX circle circle. Rev up the Friars.
[2988.81s -> 3004.90s]  I'm in a good spot. The cheerleaders in this game look dead inside.
[3005.86s -> 3008.66s]  They do have that kind of just stone cold face, don't they?
[3009.62s -> 3015.24s]  First down 30 yards to go. Ball at the 27 yard line.
[3019.74s -> 3032.54s]  Watch the left side. I got nothing. I would be too if I was dancing in this weather.
[3034.14s -> 3042.47s]  Yeah. Balance. We're going to go with jammer. I don't even know.
[3043.27s -> 3045.83s]  Guys, I just want to make sure this is clear with everybody watching.
[3046.71s -> 3055.11s]  I, I don't know what any of these mean. I mean, I have a general idea, but I don't really follow
[3055.11s -> 3060.31s]  football that much. I don't know. Like for instance, I know like cover and blitz and
[3060.31s -> 3062.95s]  zone. I don't know what any of these things really mean though.
[3064.31s -> 3067.91s]  I'm doing the thing where you play Madden against your friend and neither one of you
[3067.91s -> 3070.47s]  know what the fuck you're doing. You're just picking random plays.
[3071.59s -> 3087.56s]  Having a great time though. I have no idea. Does it matter? Not really.
[3088.36s -> 3093.72s]  Okay. This is fourth and 31. I wonder if he's going to punt it.
[3096.44s -> 3100.65s]  Why are you allowed just to beat people up? Because this is blitz.
[3101.21s -> 3108.92s]  I might be able to run this back for touchdown. Possible.
[3111.14s -> 3118.78s]  There we go. Touchdown. Got it. Oh, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[3119.50s -> 3126.28s]  And he's in. Touchdown. Have to say this guy puts the special in special teams. Why the heaven?
[3130.36s -> 3136.10s]  All right. Good. Good. Good. Turn on the face cam. I don't have any clothes on. I can't.
[3136.74s -> 3143.46s]  Do I just say fuck it and try to go for it? Fuck it. Right up the middle.
[3161.82s -> 3165.98s]  That was a mistake. Yeah, it was. I tend to make those here.
[3166.46s -> 3175.08s]  And so with three quarters gone, Las Vegas leads by six. I wanted to try to make it so if you got
[3175.08s -> 3179.00s]  a touchdown, it wouldn't have mattered. But now all he needs is a touchdown to win.
[3181.43s -> 3186.71s]  And I'm embarrassed. I'm ashamed. First and 30. Ball at the 25 yard line.
[3186.71s -> 3202.23s]  Do you have a six pack? Yeah, dude. Bullshit. Yeah, dude. Let's go with deep zones.
[3207.22s -> 3210.18s]  Jerma works out every night. No, I mean, I did 500 crunches a day.
[3211.38s -> 3226.33s]  Half a dozen donuts is not six pack. Yes, it is. I do at least five. I probably do. No,
[3226.33s -> 3238.55s]  you know, I probably do a thousand crunches a day. No, no, no, no, no. How is it fucking
[3238.55s -> 3244.95s]  possible? That auto of all people. How many tackles are you going to break after a fumble?
[3244.95s -> 3261.29s]  Really? What? This is un fucking believable. That's unbelievable. He broke like seven or
[3261.29s -> 3268.23s]  eight different tackles. After a fucking fumble. Guy gets it and just covers himself in oil and
[3268.23s -> 3287.03s]  then runs through. Fuck. Second and goal. Bad. Pumple. I popped his fucking water balloon.
[3287.03s -> 3304.46s]  Good. I haven't unleashed to third and goal. This is the game right here. I have to,
[3304.46s -> 3306.78s]  I have to unleash right here. He's got to be because he's going to get a field goal,
[3306.78s -> 3319.38s]  right? Unleash it. Why were they walking off the field? We need to stop them right here,
[3319.38s -> 3328.06s]  right now. Okay. Um, are they going for it? It's all or nothing.
[3335.11s -> 3339.83s]  Nothing. Yeah. He's tackled at the two yard line and they turn the ball over. Now they
[3339.83s -> 3346.31s]  could have used some points right there, but the defense said, no way. I got an unleash too.
[3350.26s -> 3356.62s]  Surprised. I actually, um, didn't unleash that one. Same deal. Run it before the game,
[3356.62s -> 3362.50s]  huh? Run it. They don't got any more time outs and then fucking punt it if I have to.
[3384.73s -> 3393.37s]  See you later. Break the tackle. I just like fell down. Game over. I win.
[3397.69s -> 3403.66s]  Keep that record going. Did I just walk across the field and sprinkle somebody?
[3404.86s -> 3419.96s]  I think I, yeah, I just, that was awesome. That's a win. Another close call, but still
[3419.96s -> 3431.72s]  able to keep it going. Now I got $430,000. I injured somebody. So I'm going to get a new
[3431.72s -> 3452.44s]  girlfriend, right? Man enough for Tara. $5,000 cash. Okay. Let's see what that means. Here's
[3452.44s -> 3459.61s]  Tara. You do know how to, let's get together tonight so you can try some of your moves on
[3459.61s -> 3475.22s]  me. What? No. Well, uh, sure. I guess hope this might be bad. I might have to, uh,
[3475.62s -> 3480.02s]  okay. Let's, uh, hope you don't mind. I brought a friend.
[3482.65s -> 3491.11s]  And incoming sensor ruptured spleen. I'm going to like fall out of bed and rupture my spleen.
[3498.57s -> 3502.25s]  I'm going to roll out of bed and like explode my collarbone.
[3506.86s -> 3510.70s]  You're taking them on two at a time now? You got to pace yourself, brother.
[3510.78s -> 3513.26s]  Next time since I'm that booty my way. Yeah.
[3517.85s -> 3522.10s]  Son, do you know how fast you were going? I was going 70. 68.
[3527.37s -> 3536.95s]  Oh, this is not good. Do I answer this phone? Oh, real nice. You jerk. I can't believe you
[3536.95s -> 3552.12s]  did this to me. And with her, don't call me again. Hey killer. How are you doing?
[3552.68s -> 3559.18s]  You need anything besides me? That is look, I know people, people who can get me the stuff
[3559.82s -> 3564.22s]  I already had it. And I could get it at cost. Just don't ask me where or how.
[3564.86s -> 3568.62s]  Let me know what you need and how much. I don't want, I don't want like an illegal
[3568.62s -> 3575.05s]  girlfriend. You know what I mean? Like do any legal things. Kim was by the book. This is like
[3575.05s -> 3579.37s]  illegal girlfriend. Oh, I did. I do things illegally. No, I want my, I, where's, I want
[3579.37s -> 3601.91s]  Kim back. Tara gets you drug discounts. I'm in love. Those are expensive. Okay. We need
[3602.87s -> 3614.28s]  some resist injury, break tackle, maybe, or strength. This game is something else.
[3615.42s -> 3628.39s]  It is a timeless classic. I'm going to say strength and these two weights. Yeah. Strength.
[3629.19s -> 3637.69s]  I got 150. How much of a discount though? That's all I can do. Who's still injured? Okay.
[3637.69s -> 3643.90s]  Oh man. Oh man. That's not good. Five games. Okay. So we got the,
[3643.90s -> 3650.84s]  our good halfback is in the game again. I need some more medical staff. How much is
[3650.84s -> 3662.66s]  the point? Yeah, I just get it. Good. Juicing. Let's see how much of a discount it is.
[3664.68s -> 3669.24s]  Seven. That's, that's a monumental discount. This was like what? 60. This was like 50 or
[3669.24s -> 3684.14s]  60 thousand dollars before. This is so cheap now. Juiced player is immune to injury. It
[3684.14s -> 3693.83s]  wasn't like that before, was it? Well, I'll take the legal one. I'm going to give the
[3693.83s -> 3703.85s]  halfback, I'm going to get the halfback a legal drug too. Everyone's going to take aspirin.
[3704.33s -> 3710.66s]  What the hell this is? What? Okay. What about the catcher? Should the catcher have something?
[3714.90s -> 3726.66s]  Lame streamer. Look at the team risk. If I take an illegal drug right now. Who's up next? We
[3726.66s -> 3743.69s]  got the Washington Redhawks. Okay. Scroll down on the injuries. Oh shit. That's right.
[3746.97s -> 3754.04s]  No, this is the only two. That was the only two that are there. All right. I got to,
[3755.16s -> 3759.11s]  hey, it's been an hour. That means I got to pee. So welcome to the, the,
[3759.11s -> 3764.95s]  the bi-hourly, but quarterly hourly piss. First one of the night. See you in a minute.
[3764.95s -> 3971.59s]  How did he go? So we're a new game versus the, uh, versus Washington. All right. Not as awful
[3971.59s -> 3985.06s]  as, oh and three. Hmm. Win by more than 10 points. Did I wash my hands? Yeah. I rinsed
[3985.14s -> 3996.38s]  them and I did soap. 25,000 max bet to a team that's oh and three.
[3997.02s -> 4002.63s]  They're not very, the stat wise, they're not that much better. I'm max betting it.
[4003.43s -> 4010.44s]  Let's try. The Washington Redhawks have one of the most explosive offenses in the league.
[4010.44s -> 4016.68s]  Quarterback Clayton West got with the league MVP. Now he's recording his own rap album.
[4016.68s -> 4024.15s]  He is still a damn good quarterback. Fame's gone straight to his head.
[4025.11s -> 4032.71s]  The former face of the league is now a giant douchebag. In other words, he's just right
[4032.71s -> 4054.63s]  in with the rest of the Redhawks. So, Andrew, is what you're saying. Break him, break him.
[4054.63s -> 4066.71s]  Look, I'm going to try. That's what I do every game. I go for, I go for the attack.
[4068.50s -> 4073.93s]  Good evening everyone. I'm not going to ever be able to think about anything besides Taco Bell
[4073.93s -> 4083.88s]  now. I laughed about it even on the way downstairs. Break his neck. I'm, look, I'm
[4083.88s -> 4089.98s]  going to try to do whatever I can. Ow. He's a quarterback, right?
[4092.55s -> 4096.47s]  Good thing he's got insurance. Let's start off with just a
[4096.47s -> 4105.38s]  fucked up trick play. I didn't, did I not pick one?
[4118.41s -> 4121.53s]  Fumble it again. Fumble. Fumble, fumble, fumble, fumble. Give it back.
[4140.87s -> 4149.21s]  That was loud and scary. I tried to go in for the kill there.
[4149.93s -> 4160.97s]  A little more juice. Shit. Why did I, I did like a bomb pass the first play of the game.
[4163.34s -> 4175.66s]  Blade hit. Gun unleashed. I think I gotta go for it here.
[4181.69s -> 4192.17s]  Got it. Oh, watch this one. Run it back for a touchdown right now. See you later.
[4202.10s -> 4209.45s]  Yes. Let's make them 0 and 4.
[4215.29s -> 4223.64s]  Really pushing your luck there. Well, if I had got tackled, I would have blamed it in the end.
[4227.96s -> 4247.99s]  That's not a good kick at all. Fumble. Drunk Madden. He has no commentary at all.
[4247.99s -> 4254.33s]  By the way, there is no commentary. First down and 30. The guy just says the name of the
[4254.41s -> 4259.37s]  play, what yardage it is. And then drunk John Madden talks about like diapers.
[4279.38s -> 4293.86s]  Fumble. Oh, fumble. I killed him, but he didn't fumble the ball. Spinal cord. No,
[4293.86s -> 4315.00s]  he's not dead. They got somebody yards on that too. I ain't gonna happen. Get that late hit.
[4315.56s -> 4331.30s]  Let's go to the bottom edge. I gotta go for an injury here. I'm not gonna get it. He's in a
[4331.30s -> 4343.69s]  bad spot right now. He's in like 73, 74. And I have an unleash. Third and goal. Hmm. Question
[4343.69s -> 4351.53s]  is do I use the unleash now and try to prevent a touchdown, but they'll get a field goal or do I?
[4355.77s -> 4361.62s]  I'll take it. Didn't even need to use it. I got my halfback back.
[4362.34s -> 4382.01s]  28 is back. Let's get out of the fucking end zone. Get out. Oh, look at me.
[4391.38s -> 4405.86s]  Wow. That was awesome. That is exactly what I wanted to have happen. 99 yard run.
[4406.58s -> 4423.35s]  Fumble with MVP. Yeah. We didn't have him for at least two or three games straight.
[4424.07s -> 4444.17s]  That was a 100 yard. That guy deserves extra drugs after this game. Yeah, definitely. He
[4444.17s -> 4461.35s]  deserves extra drugs. First down, 30 yards to go. You know, Mr. Super Bowl. I'm kind of surprised
[4461.35s -> 4484.90s]  that he got away from that. He's really fast. No. Let's go over like a blitz. Goodbye. See
[4484.90s -> 4505.51s]  you later. That deserves a chuck. I'm up by so much now. Well, I told you there's a reason why
[4505.51s -> 4531.40s]  you're only free. Let's go for it. 22 to zero. Have you considered becoming a professional NFL
[4531.40s -> 4540.65s]  blitz player? Yeah, I have. There's only one problem though. I think I'm the only person
[4540.65s -> 4549.80s]  that owns this game right now. So I would be, it'd be an AI tournament. If the NFL blitz the league
[4549.80s -> 4557.13s]  two tournament series, it would just be me against AI opponents in a giant stadium.
[4564.47s -> 4566.55s]  See you later to the quarterback. That's like a broken tailbone.
[4572.60s -> 4584.68s]  That's the guy that I had to go after. Five games. There's the start player. They don't
[4584.68s -> 4596.36s]  have a chance trying to injure their other quarterback. What happens if you run into all
[4596.36s -> 4611.46s]  quarterbacks? Do you have to have like the safety play quarterback? Fourth down. You're
[4611.46s -> 4621.32s]  gonna have to punt it. All right, punch that guy in the face. Get him. Do it.
[4626.17s -> 4632.90s]  There goes my appetite. Yeah, this is probably in a good game to eat too.
[4636.82s -> 4639.66s]  I'm about to get the ball back again.
[4644.79s -> 4652.04s]  Good thing he's not pregnant. First and 30. I'm gonna go with the, uh, try.
[4653.00s -> 4663.99s]  Uh-oh. No, not 28. Not 28 again. He's fine. Thank God. He would have been out
[4663.99s -> 4686.74s]  for four games. Awesome juke. Thank God. Time out. Let me get, let me get a touchdown here.
[4690.31s -> 4694.07s]  Crucial series of downs here. Ball spotted at the 13 yard line.
[4695.43s -> 4703.08s]  Two point conversion again. I bet on this game, didn't I? Yeah, I did.
[4707.48s -> 4709.56s]  I put max at $25,000 on this game.
[4715.85s -> 4733.34s]  Fuck, now I gotta kick it off. Idiot. Three seconds for them to score a touchdown.
[4734.06s -> 4737.02s]  Let's just prevent. We're gonna go just straight up,
[4738.50s -> 4743.29s]  four men in the backfield. They're going for a bomb pass.
[4751.62s -> 4761.86s]  The announcer's Frank Galliendo. I gotta get more. This is the kind of game you have to make
[4761.86s -> 4768.38s]  money because this team sucks. So I already have at least 50 grand coming in from the bet.
[4773.85s -> 4779.69s]  Somebody pick it up. That's what I'm talking about. Just get like fucking 500 grand from
[4779.69s -> 4800.92s]  this game. Shut out. It's all right. It's still game. Let's run it in there.
[4806.87s -> 4814.07s]  It's all right. Just get in there slowly. Turn up the difficulty.
[4828.44s -> 4847.66s]  Easy. Now I have to win these by a lot. Do the beer chug on cam. He flew in the air.
[4849.40s -> 4862.04s]  I'm gonna take the shot. I'm gonna try to win by 50 points. 50 to 0. That's what I'm going for
[4862.04s -> 4881.86s]  here. This guy's down at 60%. One bad injury to this guy. He'll have a play again. Crush,
[4881.86s -> 4901.26s]  we're going with the Blitz. Just take everybody over here. No fumble. Can somebody actually get
[4901.26s -> 4907.56s]  murdered? Yeah, they can go out for the whole year. Or forever, I think. My character
[4907.56s -> 4916.04s]  like died in the game, didn't he? Technically. Who caught it? Um, excuse me. I don't. There's
[4916.04s -> 4927.14s]  no explanation for what just happened. I don't. Who caught that ball? Okay, he dodges that
[4927.78s -> 4936.26s]  and then threw it over here. The guy behind him caught it without looking. It went into
[4936.26s -> 4949.46s]  his hands. I was trying to tackle that guy and I did tackle that guy. He's weird. He
[4949.46s -> 4955.03s]  was running the opposite direction without looking. It went right into his hand. How do
[4955.03s -> 4981.26s]  you miss that? Both of you. It's okay. No shut out, bud. Jeremy, you've landed like 50 punches on
[4981.26s -> 4999.66s]  camera. All right, let's go with the run. Here comes his unleash. It's probably going to be
[4999.66s -> 5003.02s]  a fumble or an injured player. So I don't know why I'm giving it to my star player.
[5003.02s -> 5011.03s]  I'm so terrified of it. Don't give the ball to that. It's time to just play
[5013.40s -> 5017.16s]  easy. No reason to give it to the halfback anymore. Not at this point.
[5020.44s -> 5043.98s]  And I gave it to him! Red zone stood again. Uh, this time we're gonna do Bolton. Hide in.
[5048.86s -> 5068.23s]  Oh well. It was worth a shot. Forget it. 1,000 yards season. That's my star player.
[5068.23s -> 5080.44s]  Thank god. I think if franchise gets an injury, the game ends. So just keep that in mind. That's
[5080.44s -> 5099.27s]  why I was a little concerned there. How did I not get that? Still got it. I don't know how.
[5099.27s -> 5102.47s]  Wow. 50 points.
[5107.91s -> 5133.90s]  What do you say you chug it? 50 points. Let's go again. Quarterback dash. There's no way he's
[5133.90s -> 5153.51s]  gonna do that twice in a row, right? Things are going well 50 to 6. And I still haven't
[5153.51s -> 5160.15s]  unleashed it. I'm going to use it right now. What percentage is this guy at right now? How
[5160.23s -> 5172.68s]  can you still be standing? It's alright. Why did he just die?
[5176.60s -> 5185.66s]  The guy that fell down is the one that got the hit. I love him. This is on PlayStation 3.
[5189.99s -> 5201.26s]  Yeah, not on Xbox right now. PS3. Oh yeah! He deserves it. You deserve it. Yeah, you
[5201.26s -> 5227.69s]  deserve it. You're not kicking a field goal. Run the whole thing back. Come on. What does
[5227.69s -> 5250.89s]  this mean? This is just a failed conversion. I was trying to build up points. Well, it
[5250.89s -> 5256.22s]  doesn't matter. Dermot, that's two points. I thought it was just a, no, it's a two-point
[5256.22s -> 5263.43s]  conversion, right? So I thought that's just a failed conversion. Not the halfback, please.
[5263.43s -> 5279.58s]  God damn it. First game, you come back. Of the seven games. God, Jesus. What?
[5295.69s -> 5309.53s]  That sucks. That actually sucks. Triangle, triangle, triangle, X. I'll try it.
[5323.48s -> 5328.28s]  He's gonna get it. I don't care. I'm just, I'm playing like a clown right now because it
[5328.28s -> 5353.27s]  doesn't matter. Some kind of currency thing. Is it? I don't know. How long is the story mode?
[5354.30s -> 5362.52s]  Uh, we are currently in the second division of one more division. So the division two,
[5362.52s -> 5368.42s]  division one. And I'm assuming like the championship of the whole game. So it seems
[5368.42s -> 5377.50s]  like we're halfway through the second division we're all about to be.
[5383.43s -> 5390.57s]  End them right now or I'm gonna leave, or I'm going. Um, I've, I've taken out at least like
[5390.57s -> 5407.32s]  four people on their team. You can't leave now. You can't leave. I just silly potted that guy's
[5407.32s -> 5439.94s]  back. Look at me. This is embarrassing.
[5446.36s -> 5460.47s]  58 to 12. Fucking cares. Oh, I was trying to be like, I was trying to BM their team.
[5462.10s -> 5470.63s]  They'll help with this for the ultimate BM. No, he's still, still okay. First and 30.
[5471.27s -> 5490.39s]  All right, let me BM their quarterback. Yeah, whatever. Let them have it. You got a touchdown.
[5490.39s -> 5501.24s]  Congratulations. Las Vegas will take this one. Oh no, I'm gonna make so much money.
[5505.29s -> 5515.40s]  64, 128,000, 45,000, 36. Oh wow. Look at that. 433 grand.
[5515.48s -> 5531.46s]  Okay, now let's go see how the halfback is doing. Also, uh, 25 minutes ago or so,
[5531.46s -> 5537.32s]  Great Canadian Fuck Club gave, uh, I think eight community subs here.
[5539.11s -> 5552.82s]  Thank you, Great Canadian. Lifestyle. Girlfriends. Tarot. Okay, you can go get
[5552.82s -> 5557.06s]  almost any type of juice at discounted rates. Do I even have any sponsors anymore?
[5558.86s -> 5571.62s]  I guess so. All right, let's go to injuries. Six games. One game. The whole,
[5571.62s -> 5578.44s]  good, that's, that's fine. Here's a problem though. This is my backup halfback. This
[5578.44s -> 5587.46s]  is my main halfback. I got, I got the third replacement here. I got the second backup
[5587.46s -> 5598.36s]  in the game. That's not good. All those halfback plays I'm gonna have to slow down on.
[5599.00s -> 5609.00s]  What do you think? Hands maybe? Block? Yeah, we need better blocks. Either that or better
[5609.00s -> 5621.22s]  break tackle. Resist injury. That's another good one. Yeah, it's important. And then block.
[5625.66s -> 5629.74s]  53 grand. Let's take a look at juicing. What have we got? Team risk is still pretty damn
[5629.74s -> 5644.12s]  high. Just take the ones that you know. Hey, look, this guy like Baxter. It's legal. Don't
[5644.12s -> 5656.41s]  worry. So 4-0. Wins to advance one. So I just have to win one more game. And I'm guaranteed
[5657.05s -> 5669.58s]  to be able to play to advance. 4-0. Chicago Marauders are the next team.
[5674.95s -> 5680.38s]  So there's three more games. I just got to win one more of these games. Shouldn't be too big
[5680.38s -> 5691.77s]  of a problem. Let's go. Defense got better. No, no, that's, oh, that's us. No, no, no,
[5692.17s -> 5704.12s]  I'm 4-0. I still got a better team. More than 23 points. I'll put 10 grand on it. I already
[5704.12s -> 5711.86s]  played, I think, the best team in the division. Max bet? Sure. We're taking on the Chicago Marauder.
[5711.86s -> 5717.72s]  Quarterback Shane Spade is a gladiator in the Windy City. 18 years in the league and still
[5717.72s -> 5726.10s]  battling. Spade may not scramble like he used to. Just make sure you get to him before he
[5726.10s -> 5740.07s]  makes the throw. A lot of quarterbacks as captains in this division. We're gonna have
[5740.07s -> 5754.33s]  to take care of them. That guy's form is really bad. Yeah, that guy has the same amount of
[5755.13s -> 5760.36s]  skill and form that I do when I go to the driving range. How many guys play golf?
[5761.00s -> 5765.56s]  How many guys don't play golf and just go and swing away at the driving range?
[5765.56s -> 5772.86s]  I used to all the time. It was so much fun. The division two campaign is well underway
[5772.86s -> 5777.02s]  and most people around this team are feeling good about their chances going forward. And
[5777.02s -> 5784.89s]  now let's get ready for the kickoff. I haven't in a long time. Nobody plays golf with it,
[5784.89s -> 5807.98s]  but people still go to the range. And please. Thank you, Sans. Already chanting bullshit.
[5807.98s -> 5820.95s]  That was the kickoff return. Fuck. That's good, good, good, good, good. No, no, no.
[5820.95s -> 5833.14s]  They got a break. Be back in like two plays. Four plays. Always goes for the ass.
[5833.78s -> 5837.14s]  Crucial series of downs here. Ball at the 17 yard line.
[5840.66s -> 5856.15s]  Guys, can somebody tackle him? That was almost the whole team. Blitz is my guy.
[5859.30s -> 5881.82s]  Shit. It's okay. Whole team can stop one guy. Usually how it works, right? Max bet. Don't
[5881.82s -> 5895.27s]  worry. Shit. All right. I got the ball. He definitely is not going to remember.
[5895.27s -> 5907.24s]  We're going to go disaster and right in the middle. No, what?
[5909.48s -> 5915.37s]  What are you doing? Why? Not good. This is not good.
[5920.73s -> 5931.14s]  Well, this is not good. Whose head is this? I bumped my head on him and he broke it.
[5931.70s -> 5950.58s]  And he's still up. Oh my God. Why? What the fuck? Why are they so good? They're
[5950.58s -> 5960.57s]  on a bunch of drugs. They have to be. Well, I don't have my good halfback.
[5963.16s -> 5966.84s]  Okay. I keep forgetting. Don't do any plays that require the halfback to run.
[5967.40s -> 5971.38s]  That is the second replacement halfback. Why would I do that?
[5984.89s -> 5996.02s]  So if I don't have any halfbacks, who is the halfback? All right. Come on. No.
[6001.56s -> 6003.40s]  That's why I was hugging the right side.
[6003.56s -> 6019.34s]  Okay. First down. Guards to go. Here we go. I can come back. Just play smart.
[6020.66s -> 6026.81s]  Don't do anything fancy. Just do smart plays. I wish I wasn't so hung over.
[6026.81s -> 6035.66s]  I'm going to drag across. Let's see if we can get the guy across. Bingo. Got it.
[6036.46s -> 6040.94s]  Just fucking play smart. I just got to get a few more yards. Third and nine.
[6045.00s -> 6062.58s]  Fuck it. Down. Down yourself. Down yourself. Slowly but surely. End of the quarter.
[6062.58s -> 6069.11s]  And that's the end of the first quarter as Chicago leads by 13. He's getting nervous.
[6070.07s -> 6073.43s]  Yeah. When you're down by 13, you've got to... Of course I'm going to be nervous.
[6075.18s -> 6086.14s]  Let's go with lightning. First and 30. Sir, don't let him catch that.
[6092.82s -> 6104.65s]  Let's try this one. Why? That could have been a big play if the ball would have gotten
[6104.65s -> 6113.66s]  to him before the defender. Fucking halfback. No. I can't do any halfback plays. He's so bad.
[6124.39s -> 6135.69s]  Get out of my life. Oh. Beer truck. Right? I don't know. How's the halfback going to
[6135.69s -> 6137.77s]  get better if you don't use him? He's not supposed to be in the game.
[6145.83s -> 6175.13s]  I need this. Get up. Fuck. Get a fumble. Look at how hurt he is. Fumble. Strip it.
[6175.77s -> 6179.69s]  This guy's at 48%. How the hell are you holding onto the ball?
[6182.10s -> 6204.95s]  48%. And he got unleashed. Nobody can hold onto that. I'm not sure there's anybody on Earth.
[6205.51s -> 6217.43s]  Who got the ball at the... Thank you. Somebody came across and made it happen.
[6218.52s -> 6225.02s]  Third and 19. I'm going to just lock it down. I'm going to hang out back here.
[6225.74s -> 6249.50s]  They're gonna punt it. See what... I can't late hit him. Punt. Although Bryant's not looking so good.
[6259.45s -> 6264.23s]  Oh, that was embarrassing. It's okay. Let's try this one.
[6264.95s -> 6279.03s]  Wide receiver. They got a lot of... Let's go right side then. Bingo. Who gets the ball to half?
[6279.03s -> 6298.31s]  Me? Hurry up. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Nice. Power wide. Is this going to
[6298.31s -> 6307.70s]  the halfback? All right. Time to shine, halfback. Come on, Baxter. Baxter, I love you.
[6310.78s -> 6335.77s]  Okay. I'm just going to go for a tie game. The chug joke is getting old. It's not a joke.
[6336.58s -> 6339.46s]  It's just in the three seconds that I have to do that, it's the only one that I've
[6339.46s -> 6355.40s]  completely memorized. Totally. Why does it keep doing the same shit? All right. Time for an
[6355.40s -> 6383.21s]  injury. Oh. How are you back in two plays? I don't know how that's possible, but okay.
[6387.51s -> 6393.29s]  Shattered bones. Where are you going? Where are you going? Give me a touchdown right now.
[6394.42s -> 6401.03s]  Oh, get out of my fucking face. No, why did you run outside? Oh, I'm so annoyed by that.
[6401.03s -> 6412.15s]  Why did you go outside? Unbelievable. That sucks. He drop kicked him in the face and
[6412.15s -> 6421.05s]  ended up running outside on his own. I didn't do that because I did the drop kick.
[6424.04s -> 6440.86s]  I'm very, very upset about that. Fucking asshole. Oh, damn it. The game hates me.
[6441.42s -> 6445.18s]  I had an opportunity to be up and now like a fucking interception
[6446.14s -> 6450.95s]  because I kicked a guy in the face and jumped out of bounds.
[6455.18s -> 6472.26s]  Fuck you. Recovered from a broken forearm. There's a lot of drugs involved guys.
[6472.26s -> 6483.80s]  I thought I had it. You don't catch that. It's impossible. You're both are putting your
[6483.80s -> 6511.83s]  hands in the air. Stop it. Block this. We got a game now. It's been a while. It's
[6511.83s -> 6527.18s]  been at least two or three games since we've had a game. Oh, their defense is so good for
[6527.18s -> 6559.10s]  some reason. And they have a fucking unleashed. I gotta watch this shit. Oops, a daisy is bad.
[6569.98s -> 6574.33s]  Fucking Sullivan has to be hurt again. Just fucking
[6591.18s -> 6596.70s]  on that plate. It's so stupid. I don't deserve it, but I'll take it. That's fine with me.
[6597.74s -> 6609.88s]  You know, I talked a lot of shit about Baxter, but he really is the only person
[6609.88s -> 6629.32s]  that's what's the, what is the code? Triangle, three triangles in one X,
[6629.88s -> 6643.10s]  triangle square XO, triangle square XO, triangle square XO. That's what somebody said.
[6645.40s -> 6654.01s]  One guy did say that. You're right. Triangle square XO.
[6655.35s -> 6679.18s]  Is that the joke that it's stuck to me? We got a game. The touchdown codes are in the menu.
[6679.18s -> 6684.68s]  Yeah, I only have four of them. I don't think you can do any of them unless they're here
[6684.68s -> 6689.78s]  because we tried them before. Beer Chug really is the best one of these four.
[6690.50s -> 6705.13s]  There's only four codes. You have to unlock them. That's what I figured.
[6706.01s -> 6716.52s]  Looks like it's gonna be Beer Chug. Don't hurt him. Not good. Drop that ball.
[6721.43s -> 6723.27s]  Bumble. Oh, I'm sorry.
[6733.82s -> 6741.43s]  And ruin that guy's life. Well, we're in Blitz. We're in the Blitz League.
[6745.35s -> 6746.55s]  Just give me one second here.
[6746.55s -> 6761.62s]  At least he's going for a few games instead of a few plays. Yeah, that's true.
[6762.42s -> 6775.02s]  Was it third down? Second down. Second to 17. Not gonna happen. Third down.
[6778.30s -> 6785.93s]  Got an unleash. I'm gonna hold on to it. It's 20-20. Stay. Let's go. Just deep zones.
[6786.90s -> 6789.54s]  Quarterback passes all the damn time. Just gonna block it.
[6795.19s -> 6801.18s]  I can't fucking believe that just happens. What happened here?
[6803.05s -> 6813.62s]  I was ready for him right here. Okay, here's the chain of events here.
[6814.26s -> 6818.74s]  This guy doesn't tackle. Instead, I come across with franchise. Try to do the tackle. Don't
[6818.74s -> 6823.94s]  get it. This guy tackles franchise. And that guy fell down because I grabbed his toe. Great.
[6824.90s -> 6830.12s]  Good work, guys. As we reach the end of the third quarter, we're tied.
[6840.78s -> 6848.39s]  I don't want to use the unleash, though. Make him kick a field goal and then I can
[6848.39s -> 6863.53s]  use the unleash to get a touchdown. Don't let him get it. No unleash. Not necessary. Don't do it.
[6873.67s -> 6881.96s]  Use unleash to defend? I don't think I need to right now. See you later. That's the
[6881.96s -> 6896.68s]  quarterback. Oh, Brake is back. Best thing that could have happened. Get their backup quarterback
[6896.68s -> 6900.36s]  in here. Fourth goal. They're going for a field goal? I don't know. What are they doing?
[6901.16s -> 6912.68s]  They're going for a field goal. Block it. Don't go. No go. No good. No, it wasn't.
[6915.00s -> 6939.18s]  It bounced off the middle. What? Oh, it bounced in. Touchdown wins the game. All right.
[6939.82s -> 6943.11s]  I got a false set of downs here to get at least a field goal.
[6950.41s -> 6957.19s]  Rip the bet. Yeah, that's all right. I need to win the game. How many yards is that?
[6957.19s -> 6969.35s]  Eight? Not very much. Wide open. Why would you jump and land on your back?
[6970.84s -> 6987.32s]  What did you do that for? Why would you do that? Catch it and turn around. I don't need
[6987.40s -> 7012.63s]  to use time up, but I panicked. I just did. I gotta play defense. That should be the game.
[7013.43s -> 7043.34s]  Field goal won't win it. Don't get this blocked. Defense. They have no unleash.
[7044.22s -> 7053.03s]  Play smart. You gotta be fucking kidding me. You've gotta be kidding me. No, somebody get him.
[7053.75s -> 7076.30s]  Oh, I can't believe it. It's a fake. Okay. All right. All right. 27 great. I need a field goal.
[7082.65s -> 7087.77s]  Field goal is all I need. Just get there. No, run it back for a fucking touchdown right now.
[7090.81s -> 7099.26s]  Get into field goal range. Am I field goal range? I'm so fucked. My heart is just
[7099.26s -> 7113.51s]  pounding right now. What the hell? I have one time out. Oh, come on. I'm just panicking.
[7113.91s -> 7120.89s]  I gotta kick a field goal. Fuck. How far am I away? I'm fucked.
[7147.75s -> 7180.09s]  I shouldn't have lost that fucking game. The run back for a touchdown just gets slippery
[7180.09s -> 7185.61s]  bullshit. I make like two tackles and he just bribes it. Fuck off. All right. I'm
[7185.69s -> 7208.98s]  nine and two right now, agent. I'm so mad right now. Fucking hell. Miami Hammerheads. I'm so
[7208.98s -> 7216.74s]  unreasonably upset. Yeah. All right. Injuries. Finally, I get my halfback who is one of the best
[7216.74s -> 7222.66s]  halfbacks in the league and he's in the game. I wonder if I'll have him for one game and then
[7222.66s -> 7238.14s]  he'll break a bone and be gone for two games. Baxter is great. Don't fuck Baxter. Go back
[7238.14s -> 7257.45s]  to experimenting on flies and the Ninja Turtles. I don't think it can do anything. 2-11. No,
[7257.45s -> 7266.12s]  fuck you, Gerva. No, I'm kidding. Baxter was the only one that did anything, but I can't
[7266.12s -> 7270.78s]  believe they ran it back for a touchdown. I can't believe it. All I had to do is just
[7270.78s -> 7279.67s]  tackle and they broke every tackle. Why is the team risk always so high?
[7280.87s -> 7289.86s]  Screw it. Ball carrier gets a clash icon for every 30 yards gained in a play.
[7291.64s -> 7295.27s]  That's actually kind of insane. I don't give a shit. Send me to jail.
[7296.15s -> 7320.49s]  Miami Hammerheads. They're a good team too. Same record. That was such a hard one to swallow.
[7320.49s -> 7324.94s]  It's all right. I'm still one of the best teams in the league. Miami Hammerheads. Let's
[7324.94s -> 7330.38s]  go. The Hammerheads used to be a team going nowhere. Now they're on everyone's radar. Their
[7330.46s -> 7337.16s]  fortunes change when they move from Orlando to Miami and the biggest salary in the league
[7337.16s -> 7341.99s]  and his precision guided attack is worth that. He's so expensive they can't afford
[7341.99s -> 7346.63s]  to repair the hurricane damage to the stadium. Why are they dropping? When he's not bombing
[7346.63s -> 7354.01s]  defenses through the air, he's burning them up. Look at the stadium. He's too much money.
[7354.73s -> 7366.15s]  So they can't repair the stadium. That's really fucking ridiculous. The stadium is
[7366.23s -> 7369.11s]  in complete disarray and they don't have the money to repair it.
[7379.67s -> 7390.30s]  Bad in the trenches and they have a good spread offense. Good evening and welcome.
[7390.30s -> 7397.48s]  Gotta hold Williams down to 200 yards. Good luck. It's all right. We're in the home game.
[7401.40s -> 7407.21s]  Started off good. That's a good fucking way to start it I would say. With a touchdown.
[7407.21s -> 7421.27s]  With a touchdown I would say. With a touchdown I would say. No. Got the half back as well.
[7422.07s -> 7444.22s]  It's gut check time. It's all right. Asshole. Let's go with the bolt. Tight end bolt. Nice job.
[7444.94s -> 7448.84s]  Nice job Schloser or whatever his name is. First touchdown of the game.
[7458.41s -> 7465.67s]  We said 5,000 bits just came in. 50 bucks from La Cranda. Thank you La Cranda for the 50,
[7466.47s -> 7474.28s]  5, 0, 0, 0, 5,000 bits. And you say, what do you say? Let's see. Hey Jeremy,
[7474.28s -> 7477.32s]  it's clear what you have to do. Just run the ball all the way to the right and get
[7477.32s -> 7482.97s]  a touchdown. It's just that easy. You mean like this guy's doing right now.
[7482.97s -> 7491.02s]  Except he's going left. Thank you so much La Cranda. It's a lot of money.
[7491.66s -> 7495.24s]  And I already got an unleashed. Let's see if we can get a fumble right now.
[7495.24s -> 7501.00s]  Let's just go with the all out blitz. We're talking like literal all out just blitz.
[7501.00s -> 7512.68s]  Everybody on the team. Get everyone over here. Choke slam. Oh that was really cool.
[7512.68s -> 7521.42s]  Like I didn't drop it. They got a long way to go. Let's just do some
[7522.22s -> 7529.62s]  kind of a waste of a little unleash unfortunately. What are you throwing?
[7531.62s -> 7536.62s]  Asshole. I didn't have a meter. I burnt the meter.
[7544.02s -> 7551.35s]  What the hell were you doing? I got absolutely, I got a second and goal.
[7551.99s -> 7561.72s]  No meter at all. I'm going to get a dirty hit. I thought he was going to throw it.
[7561.72s -> 7581.06s]  I was waiting for it. Let's uh bomb edge it. Nothing. Fourth down. Good luck.
[7581.06s -> 7586.84s]  Get a field goal dude. Hold them to a field goal. I'll be happy.
[7602.94s -> 7604.46s]  These super bowlers sure are good.
[7607.58s -> 7614.82s]  What are they chanting? Are they saying Yankees suck?
[7615.62s -> 7633.50s]  Why would they be doing that? Who's injured? Shoulder dislocation.
[7633.50s -> 7656.26s]  Oh, slippery hands. Slippery. He's gone. It's all right. Slippery fucking fingers. It's okay.
[7656.26s -> 7664.33s]  It's like quadruple coverage. He's still gone.
[7667.93s -> 7670.87s]  Let's do a run this way with the halfback.
[7671.51s -> 7695.77s]  I juked that one. Minecraft Steve. It is kind of Minecraft Steve.
[7699.13s -> 7706.46s]  Yeah that was a good, that was a good play. See this is why we need Sullivan.
[7707.18s -> 7711.66s]  Because if that was Baxter, he probably would have fallen down.
[7713.91s -> 7727.80s]  Baxter doesn't make that play. We don't get that touchdown. Fumble. Yep.
[7728.52s -> 7735.94s]  Oh this is good. Did I max bet? I don't think I max bet. Did I?
[7744.90s -> 7755.14s]  Touchdown. Just right up the middle. Just jump over the edge.
[7763.64s -> 7764.84s]  Did I bet though? I don't remember.
[7765.56s -> 7786.41s]  I didn't bet at all. Oh well. Don't get comfortable though. This team is really good.
[7787.05s -> 7791.88s]  It's like the only other four-in-one team in the league.
[7800.92s -> 7823.53s]  See you. On leash is back. Good. Standard cover play. I think that sounds good for me.
[7823.53s -> 7841.13s]  He's going to throw it. No he's not. Oh unbelievable. Unbelievable. Same thing. Do it again.
[7851.37s -> 7871.61s]  See ya. All right. Play smart. That's all I gotta do. This will take me to the championship.
[7874.60s -> 7883.67s]  Miami sucks. But they don't. They're four-in-one just like me. Just getting good turnovers.
[7886.15s -> 7889.67s]  And yeah we have Sullivan. It's a completely different team like somebody just said.
[7890.31s -> 7895.35s]  This is one of the best players on the team and in the league. And they've been absent.
[7895.91s -> 7906.26s]  If Sullivan is on the team we win by 40 points. That's just how it works.
[7909.14s -> 7918.39s]  I'm on easy difficulty. I don't think. Is there even a difficulty slider in this game?
[7918.39s -> 7922.55s]  I don't think there is. I haven't used it. This is just the campaign.
[7930.68s -> 7950.42s]  Yeah it's on easy. What? There is. There is no difficulty. Easy. Turn the music on. I can't.
[7950.42s -> 7956.79s]  The whole stream will be muted. It is just constant 100% copyright and music the whole game.
[7956.79s -> 7970.20s]  So no one will be able to watch this vlog. That's fourth down. And they got two seconds.
[7970.20s -> 7985.10s]  Five seconds. They're gonna. You have to go for it. Right? Yeah. Get back here. Oh!
[7990.07s -> 7996.55s]  He's gonna make it. He made it. Oh why did I let that happen? It's because I. Punt.
[7997.75s -> 8004.31s]  Why did I do punt return? Oh my fucking god. Punt return. Great job. Yeah it's. There's
[8004.31s -> 8019.00s]  like five seconds fucking left. And so at halftime Las Vegas leads by 17.
[8020.04s -> 8028.09s]  It's okay. Fuck me. Why do I always let the most bogus shit happen?
[8030.55s -> 8034.90s]  With five seconds left I'm gonna run the whole field. Just fucking kill this guy.
[8035.54s -> 8056.04s]  First down 30 yards to go. Sheep pass and it's caught at the three and they bring him down.
[8056.04s -> 8063.90s]  Like I will beat this guy in a football match. But you give somebody a chance to like
[8063.90s -> 8068.94s]  fucking throw up down the field and like run by everybody with two seconds left it'll happen every
[8068.94s -> 8087.77s]  time. It was like fucking quadruple cover. Nobody got that. I don't have a meter either.
[8087.77s -> 8090.57s]  All right. That's why I said it can't get comfortable to four in one team. Let's go.
[8091.69s -> 8112.28s]  Can't get comfy. Play smart. See? Just playing. Don't go in for anything crazy.
[8121.98s -> 8134.25s]  Fucking murdering. I'm trying to play smart. I'm trying to build meter. Fourth down. See?
[8134.25s -> 8146.26s]  They didn't get shit. Now are you gonna go for it? Right now. They are. They're going for it on
[8146.26s -> 8163.67s]  fourth down. Turnover on downs. Exactly what I needed to have happen. Let's just go with
[8163.67s -> 8186.46s]  some short passes. NV coach. What's wrong with the Nevada coach? That was a little bit of
[8186.46s -> 8191.51s]  game. Just a little bit. I'm gonna run it. I'm gonna get the half back situation right here.
[8191.51s -> 8202.47s]  Float left. I got a little bit of meter. Let's go. Right up the middle. Straight through. Just
[8202.47s -> 8230.81s]  run. QB dash. Just walk over the line. Don't want to get tackled though. All it takes
[8230.81s -> 8243.02s]  is a broken skull and I have to delete the game. Really? All right. I gotta unleash this.
[8243.82s -> 8252.34s]  I'm going for an actual unleash. Oh no!
[8266.44s -> 8301.38s]  Turbo boomer activated. What does that mean? Look at me! Now I can relax. I'm up by way too
[8301.38s -> 8313.00s]  much. Las Vegas refuses to call off the dogs as they add to their lead. Insult. Let's insult
[8313.00s -> 8330.98s]  them. 43-11. Where was this yesterday? And by yesterday I mean in the video game. I couldn't
[8330.98s -> 8344.62s]  do anything. Couldn't get a fumble. Couldn't get a turnover. Good thing there's no injury
[8344.62s -> 8353.10s]  there. What difficulty am I playing on? There is no difficulty. I don't know. Normal? Regular?
[8362.34s -> 8372.46s]  Watch this. I just want everyone to be aware of this. One, two, three, four people here. And he
[8372.46s -> 8403.62s]  we synchronized swam and he caught the ball. Punch somebody. Swam? A word? Yeah. Swam. I swam
[8403.62s -> 8421.59s]  there. You didn't. You swam. That's word. I swam. I swam. I swam. I swam. What is it? Swan?
[8422.84s -> 8436.04s]  I swam. I swam there. No it's not swum. It's swam. Swimmed? Now you're just fucking around.
[8436.68s -> 8468.17s]  Okay. No. I got. Let's burn the clock. He's now over the 100 yard mark. Swimmed. Swum.
[8469.37s -> 8484.28s]  Anybody that joins the stream right now and looks at chat are probably going to be like,
[8485.24s -> 8488.31s]  is this like a funny in-joke that this guy has in the stream?
[8504.73s -> 8508.20s]  Injury. Nope.
[8514.92s -> 8516.97s]  That's a pretty good point.
[8520.49s -> 8526.25s]  It's pretty much what we just heard. Smart announcer.
[8526.89s -> 8544.44s]  Okay. John Fadden is a BF. He kind of is. In a way. That's not a safety.
[8546.20s -> 8555.32s]  All right. This is the opportunity. We're going to hurt someone. Just go full. I don't
[8555.32s -> 8559.88s]  even care if they score a touchdown. Who cares? We're going to go special teams and field goal
[8559.88s -> 8581.86s]  block. Got it. That's it. I'll take the ball. Well that's a good
[8581.86s -> 8590.95s]  achievement for that somehow. Oh well. 45-17. I'll take the win. Now we qualify for the division
[8590.95s -> 8602.14s]  two championship. Moving on to the championship game. I don't think he got 200 yards did he?
[8602.86s -> 8621.56s]  Should have wagered. Safety dance. New trophy. Half of the second Super Bowl.
[8622.36s -> 8627.35s]  Division two Super Bowl. Well not yet. There's still one more game in the division.
[8634.28s -> 8638.92s]  If you want I can arrange to have them party with ace's captain Amos Newell.
[8638.92s -> 8643.00s]  Maybe wear him out before the game. It's going to cost but you know I got it.
[8643.00s -> 8652.76s]  Just let me know. Sabotaging the other team? Yeah. I think so. That's a good idea. Do it.
[8652.84s -> 8672.87s]  National ad campaign. So what does that mean? Play next game at Las Vegas Aces.
[8676.87s -> 8688.78s]  So with the Las Vegas Aces versus the Las Vegas Super Bowls. Who's the real Vegas team?
[8688.78s -> 8697.02s]  I was going to name my team the Las Vegas Aces. You remember? It was going to be the Las Vegas
[8697.02s -> 8704.78s]  Aces versus the Las Vegas Aces. That's too bad. So we'll find out who the best team in Vegas is.
[8706.30s -> 8727.88s]  But first. Okay let's go to upgrades. Agility. Get everything to two. Agility. Juicing. Mr.
[8727.88s -> 8734.20s]  Super Bowl. We're going to give you something good. Successful clash moves drain clash from
[8734.28s -> 8739.45s]  opponent's clash bar. That's pretty good. Regenerate two stamina each player on the
[8739.45s -> 8749.62s]  field. He's on every play. Let's give Sullivan something. Turbobar drains 50% slower. Yeah I
[8749.62s -> 8770.68s]  think so. Somebody on defense too. J. Cruz. Give you something easy. Training is fine.
[8770.68s -> 8777.26s]  Everything looks all right. All right. Here we go. Las Vegas Aces versus the Las Vegas
[8777.26s -> 8788.92s]  Super Bowls. Good luck. They're not a bad team. I do have to max bet on the Las Vegas
[8788.92s -> 8794.90s]  game though. Why wouldn't I do that? Five and one. Three and three. They're not a bad team.
[8795.70s -> 8823.62s]  Let's go. Las Vegas Aces and the new home of Amos Newell. Linebacker. Okay. Where are we
[8823.62s -> 8838.50s]  playing? We playing in my Vegas stadium or their Vegas stadium? Both at the same time.
[8839.22s -> 8855.77s]  You share one. That's a cool logo. Good evening and welcome. Take a look at that crowd.
[8857.02s -> 8865.24s]  You can see who they really support in that audience. We're on their home turf and they are
[8865.24s -> 8872.10s]  wearing my colors. Look at that. People's champion is right here. Absolutely. That's not
[8872.10s -> 8893.72s]  good. That's a fumble. No it's not. If it's Las Vegas versus Las Vegas who is it in a way
[8893.72s -> 8913.85s]  game for? First and 30. I don't know. Apparently me. Damn it. Fumble out of bounds. All right.
[8913.85s -> 8917.37s]  Take it seriously. This is a good team. Even though I already clinched the playoffs. It's
[8917.37s -> 8944.62s]  fine. No balance. Balance deep. Third and seven. How much time are you going to give them?
[8945.74s -> 8969.91s]  Oh boy. Bullshit. Let's do a trick play here. Maniac. I couldn't get rid of it. He's
[8969.91s -> 8996.17s]  going in a circle. I tricked myself. Third and 33 is long. Holy fucking triangle.
[8996.97s -> 9017.78s]  See you later. Sullivan's got it. Touchdown. He extended that reception all the way into
[9017.78s -> 9021.14s]  the end zone. Nice yards after the catch. This is the last game of the season.
[9023.99s -> 9026.63s]  This is just a fun game because it doesn't matter if I win or lose.
[9028.07s -> 9039.10s]  I already clinched the playoffs. That would have been embarrassing. It's all good.
[9043.53s -> 9063.48s]  $25,000 bet. I needed to win by, what was it? 17? 18? Let's go for the head. Drop of the ball.
[9064.60s -> 9079.03s]  Wide receiver. That's pretty good. This is the championship. What is this though?
[9079.03s -> 9101.32s]  This might be the local championship. It's Vegas Vegas. I couldn't go anywhere.
[9101.32s -> 9123.64s]  It's the Vegas bowl. Two Vegas teams in the same division. Hold them here. Should be able
[9123.64s -> 9132.18s]  to do it. That was a trick play. Franchise performs 30 or more dirty hits. What was that?
[9132.74s -> 9139.42s]  I didn't see what that said. And that's the end of the first quarter as Las Vegas leads by seven.
[9142.65s -> 9166.95s]  But which Las Vegas? Fourth and 16. They're gonna punt it. I gotta stop jumping. If you
[9166.95s -> 9171.51s]  jump in the area and get tackled, you have a much higher percentage chance to get hurt
[9171.51s -> 9179.77s]  or drop the ball. And though it does work sometimes. You've seen me jump over tackles
[9179.77s -> 9215.53s]  before. Who is it? Drop it. Give me this back. That sucks. Broken humors. Here we go again.
[9216.25s -> 9222.07s]  I get the ball at the half. So they do all these weird. What the fuck was that?
[9223.48s -> 9246.20s]  Why did he just fall on his back? Whatever. I got meter. I'll probably use it.
[9246.20s -> 9273.05s]  Goodbye. Quarterback is gone. Two plays. What have I happened to like the skull contusions?
[9287.53s -> 9293.85s]  Second pick off. Really? Is this a wrestling game? It's whatever you want it to be.
[9294.65s -> 9304.86s]  You have to stop aiming for their ass. It's just so easy to do that though.
[9309.45s -> 9327.26s]  Fuck it. Let's go. Thought I could push him. Cut across. God damn it.
[9328.86s -> 9335.64s]  I get the ball in 13 seconds. So here's what we're gonna do.
[9355.05s -> 9358.81s]  I could have kicked the field but I wanted to. Look this game doesn't matter. I can just do
[9358.81s -> 9383.16s]  whatever I want. That's a touchdown. Thanks. Okay we're good. 86 yard return. Let's just get in
[9383.16s -> 9410.23s]  their red zone. Power wide. Another leash. I'm just gonna kick the field goal. I did bet too
[9410.23s -> 9427.53s]  right? I did a max bet. We gotta get that money. Let Baxter play. Can you even do
[9427.53s -> 9434.50s]  substitutions in this game? I don't think you can. If I go up by 30 points then he'll come in.
[9444.63s -> 9456.66s]  Cooler guy. Out for one play. This guy is made out of clay. That's it he's back.
[9460.50s -> 9479.67s]  Welcome back. Zack. No there he is. No he had a concussion already didn't he?
[9480.39s -> 9503.85s]  I'm so confused. Oh and his throwing arm too. Two three plays. I'm making a lot of good
[9503.85s -> 9523.75s]  injury plays and they're not really doing very much. Whoops a daisy. This is my opportunity to
[9523.75s -> 9538.38s]  get the money. I hate when that happens. It's so stupid. Seriously when it bounces off the
[9538.38s -> 9580.07s]  fucking ground. I need to win by 17 points. Who was it? Broken ribs. Oh Mims is good.
[9585.69s -> 9607.66s]  Two plays good. Out for 200 games. Get in there. I think I'm going for a QB.
[9608.30s -> 9611.91s]  First and goal. It's gut check. Walk across the line. Three two one go.
[9615.29s -> 9644.68s]  Seriously. Do it again. Three two one go. Las Vegas widens the gap. Somebody just wrote stop.
[9656.84s -> 9666.98s]  Another unleash meter and I'm up by 17. Triangle square x circle.
[9668.31s -> 9671.03s]  I don't think any of the other codes work because I have to unlock them.
[9672.82s -> 9687.48s]  Right in his neck. His chest. What is this going to be? Four games.
[9689.21s -> 9697.34s]  Zynar. Las Vegas needs to do something here to get their offense in motion.
[9698.38s -> 9704.07s]  He's going long and it's complete at the 45 yard line.
[9706.50s -> 9710.66s]  Saw something in the defense and jumped out of the big game. Sets them up in nice field
[9710.66s -> 9717.30s]  position and so with three quarters gone leads by 22. Collar bones are made out of dry
[9717.30s -> 9723.06s]  spaghetti and it might be second best chat comment of the night behind Taco Bell.
[9727.10s -> 9737.91s]  I got baited into tackling the wrong guy. It makes the same noise too.
[9738.63s -> 9742.47s]  If you take a handful of like angel hair pasta and crush it it'll sound like that.
[9743.19s -> 9748.18s]  Looks like they'll have four more downs to work with. The offense is looking good.
[9748.18s -> 9753.75s]  They're driving. It's the coach's favorite place on the field. The red zone.
[9756.49s -> 9765.06s]  Tackleman coming one two three. I gotta get another touchdown now to get that money.
[9765.94s -> 9774.97s]  They're going for it. Good go for it. That means nope they ain't gonna get it. So that's
[9774.97s -> 9783.48s]  six. I need to get a field goal. And it looks like they'll try an onside kick here.
[9788.14s -> 9806.84s]  Um why are you so bad at this game? I'm nine and two. What? No not the same guy. Holy shit.
[9808.81s -> 9818.84s]  They just like squished me. No no. Same guy.
[9822.87s -> 9827.03s]  They just put me in a vice and crushed my body. Thank god I picked it up so I can get
[9827.03s -> 9834.12s]  the point. He's going for eight games. Don't stumble like that.
[9842.65s -> 9848.71s]  28. That's plenty. Just uh just try to be who cares. Rub it in.
[9856.09s -> 9882.26s]  That's two dead players for the Super Bowlers now. Late hit. Mims is gonna have to retire
[9882.26s -> 9890.52s]  after this one. Yeah there's a lot of broken bones. A lot of shattered spleens unfortunately.
[9891.48s -> 9900.54s]  Watch this. Jade's got 84. I've had it. Always go for the head every time.
[9904.20s -> 9914.44s]  Oh that hurts. I've been knocking him up for like one to two plays this whole game.
[9915.24s -> 9930.71s]  I love this game. The noises, the sounds, the close-ups.
[9933.19s -> 9948.07s]  Watch this. This guy's dead. Get up. Go ahead. I was hoping for something devastating there.
[9959.03s -> 9967.80s]  Hey that's me. Now you try to tell me in the easiest possible language here.
[9969.80s -> 9992.39s]  How did he not go down from that? That's the worst one. What happened? Right here. Guy on
[9992.39s -> 10026.70s]  the left. I haven't selected. Crush right into his body. No. I need one point. I need one
[10026.78s -> 10040.01s]  point. Just get close enough. First down and 30. No not 28. Thank goodness.
[10040.81s -> 10052.01s]  Oh every time. Good. Use your timeouts. I'm okay with that. Okay almost there.
[10053.62s -> 10057.98s]  Who needs that when you just get a fucking touchdown right?
[10058.70s -> 10072.90s]  Franchise finds the end zone once again.
[10089.00s -> 10104.02s]  Okay now do not let them score. Let them go. Let them run for five seconds. Larsen this
[10104.02s -> 10112.78s]  is up to you. I want this to be over now. Shit they get one play. I'm going all the way back
[10112.78s -> 10123.82s]  here. I'll be ready for him. Who do we even do that to? And I got the bet.
[10132.12s -> 10149.10s]  Pretty good. That was a $25,000 bet. Time for the division two championship. New sponsor,
[10149.10s -> 10166.90s]  the enforcer. Dura shock gloves. Cool. League MVP. How am I not the MVP?
[10171.18s -> 10174.97s]  How many touchdowns do I have? I have like 60 touchdowns.
[10175.45s -> 10187.30s]  I told them. Hey hold that thought. This is my boy. Franchise. One game buddy. One more
[10187.30s -> 10191.94s]  and it's division one. The big time. You get this done and we're gonna have a license to
[10191.94s -> 10202.02s]  print money. Okay here comes the D2 championship. Tara wants to hang out.
[10203.30s -> 10206.92s]  Rough boy. Already fighting for a spot in division one.
[10207.64s -> 10209.96s]  Just remember what you've got waiting for you if you make it.
[10209.96s -> 10216.04s]  Okay. Hey Franch, can you believe it? The sponsor decided to take a pass on you and
[10216.04s -> 10221.64s]  went with grace for their ad campaign. Don't take it too hard buddy. She's only the hottest
[10221.64s -> 10226.68s]  athlete turned supermodel. I just hung up on him. Hey it's me. Man I gotta tell you every
[10226.68s -> 10231.48s]  time you lay a dirty hit on some stupid SOB it's pure money and you've gotten 30 of them
[10231.48s -> 10236.44s]  already this season. That caught the attention of our new sponsor who by the way is sending
[10236.44s -> 10244.94s]  some sweet new gear to your team's clubhouse as we speak. Okay let's take one. Sponsor
[10244.94s -> 10253.24s]  let's see. New gloves all right. Plus six hands. That's really really good actually.
[10257.77s -> 10270.07s]  What's going on with the girlfriend front here? Okay injuries. Who is it? Seven. Gonna
[10270.07s -> 10286.66s]  have to give a game crashed. Please tell me it's saved. Did you crash or are you
[10286.66s -> 10303.14s]  just having a little slow down period here? I think it autosaves so we might have to listen
[10303.14s -> 10318.31s]  to those phone calls again. Okay well let's reset it. Let me just let's try again.
[10322.50s -> 10351.96s]  Maybe I clicked too fast. What does that mean? No we're good. Sort of weird but
[10351.96s -> 10367.06s]  whatever. Is it yellow? No no it's not yellow. Odd. Hopefully it saved the game.
[10367.86s -> 10379.16s]  Now that means it's an actual full-on crash if it's yellow. No I think it was just a disk
[10379.16s -> 10388.54s]  read problem. Just kind of ran into itself. Let's see if that worked. That's not the correct
[10388.54s -> 10413.19s]  image. Yeah that we definitely saw that so it should be fine. Powered by GameSpy. They
[10413.19s -> 10425.08s]  don't exist anymore. It's been a while since they've existed. Is Jerma old enough to be
[10425.08s -> 10431.77s]  playing this? No. All right wait a minute. Let me see. X trees. Touchdown codes. Here we go.
[10432.65s -> 10444.76s]  How do I unlock them? Yeah I can't do any of these. These have to be unlocked. So it's
[10444.76s -> 10463.40s]  either beer chug or ball spike knockout. Continue. Select yeah Super Bowls. Hopefully
[10463.40s -> 10466.74s]  if we don't do the last game again. There we go. Okay good.
[10473.94s -> 10482.54s]  Hey it's me. Man I got. Okay so I went here to the trainer to go to injuries and we had a problem.
[10482.54s -> 10490.63s]  I want to assign staff here. There we go. Everybody for the ruptured spleen. Let's go
[10490.63s -> 10499.34s]  to upgrades. Passing is definitely everything will be at two. If we can work from there.
[10499.34s -> 10505.61s]  I'm gonna do probably tackle and break tackle after this. Points automatically.
[10506.49s -> 10519.93s]  Risk is high. So just do the legal one. Let's get on some defense to uh J. Cruz.
[10520.65s -> 10533.77s]  Let's get Sullivan some of this as well. All right so this is the this is the championship
[10533.77s -> 10538.49s]  for with the Miami Hammerheads. I think I'll get a piss first. It's been it's been a
[10538.49s -> 10544.12s]  bi-quarterly two hours. So it's time for me to pee one more time. I'm not like drinking
[10544.12s -> 10658.78s]  anymore coffee so don't worry. Be right back. Championship game. What do you say?
[10664.68s -> 10673.51s]  Oh did I beat this team last time? Overall they're a little better. Not really though.
[10673.51s -> 10680.18s]  They have a better offense. Great Canadian Fuck Club. Thanks for five community subs
[10680.98s -> 10691.98s]  on top of the nearly 10 that you gave earlier. Thank you so much for the super subs. That's a
[10691.98s -> 10715.58s]  lot. I'm not betting. Let's go. D2 championship. Jeremy you may win the Super Bowl but have you
[10715.58s -> 10727.72s]  won six? I have not. I have not won the Super Bowl that many times. Good evening ever. It's
[10727.72s -> 10734.87s]  the Division 2 championship and we are rearing. There we go. I mean there's a lot of places I
[10734.87s -> 10744.66s]  could be but I mean this is gonna be unbelievable. Light and a thunder and lightning storm too.
[10745.38s -> 10757.62s]  Right off the bat. That was a good hit. When he does that John Madden impression it just
[10757.62s -> 10762.12s]  sounds like he's about to burp the whole time he's talking. He's fighting back burps.
[10762.76s -> 10772.55s]  It's an opportunity. Really? That was just he did a really great job there.
[10774.04s -> 10786.28s]  Second down and about a mile. No first down. Your offense is the best part.
[10786.92s -> 10790.38s]  I gotta play better defense. The quarterback is really good. Injure the quarterback.
[10796.73s -> 10814.44s]  No! We're good. Who is it? 41. Dupree. It's all right. Two plays. He intercepted that play.
[10815.00s -> 10823.35s]  Not with his hands. That's right. First down. 30 yards to go. Capitalize on an
[10823.35s -> 10828.63s]  intercepted. It's a championship game for god's sakes. Don't throw it into triple coverage.
[10829.80s -> 10856.92s]  Oh my god. I haven't unleashed. Go for the quarterback.
[10867.93s -> 10874.79s]  If I can get that quarterback here. I would have had it too. This is bad.
[10875.35s -> 10883.27s]  God damn it. I would have had it too. I was a tenth of a second late on the sack. I thought I
[10883.27s -> 10921.18s]  could get it. Interception into an interception. I picked the play. Let's go. I have to be careful
[10921.18s -> 10924.86s]  because he has it unleashed. He could strip the ball from me right now if he really wanted to.
[10924.86s -> 10937.94s]  Great blocking. Okay. Get it to Sullivan.
[10938.90s -> 10964.46s]  Fuck. I can't get anything going. I'm trying to activate the
[10965.42s -> 10978.10s]  unleashed but they keep denying it. Right over him. That should be a touchdown.
[10978.74s -> 10997.42s]  There it is. Don't just score. Score, score, score. He landed on his keys.
[10997.42s -> 11001.37s]  I've been caught on TV doing the most moves I'd like to have. You know,
[11001.37s -> 11005.99s]  head fake your dance partner one way and then juke him the next and then bam.
[11005.99s -> 11019.51s]  Yeah, I wasn't going to taunt. Sat it against him. Brand new ball game.
[11019.51s -> 11041.29s]  How did you miss that one? Sir, honest to god. How did I miss the first one?
[11043.96s -> 11047.24s]  How is it even, whatever. I'm fine. And I just did a goal line play.
[11048.12s -> 11059.21s]  There it is. I got it all back. I'm getting killed though on every category.
[11064.98s -> 11084.97s]  Second and 40. They got a long way to go. It's not far enough. Same deal. Third and 31.
[11084.97s -> 11097.88s]  They're in field goal range though I think. There it is. Hold them to field goal.
[11100.18s -> 11104.97s]  My computer just blue screened after that Madden joke. I'm sorry to hear that.
[11106.01s -> 11112.54s]  By the way, I'm doing a punt return. He's gonna miss it.
[11117.58s -> 11129.40s]  It's alright. Everything's good. I might be able to get a touchdown here if I play
[11129.40s -> 11135.51s]  the cards right. You can't. Come on. Hammer through that.
[11147.86s -> 11155.37s]  Looking for a first down here. That was good. Electrocute his brain.
[11155.37s -> 11160.78s]  Get him out of the game for now. It didn't even do much for me either.
[11160.78s -> 11170.68s]  That guy was right in front of me. Where are my blockers? Second and 18.
[11182.42s -> 11192.04s]  Oh god. This is bad. Third down. Back spasms. You should be back in like one play.
[11192.44s -> 11196.68s]  Four plays.
[11202.74s -> 11222.76s]  Can I get it? Got it. That guy was just barely about to not be open. I got really lucky there.
[11228.65s -> 11230.17s]  Unleash the scare and the shit out of me.
[11244.06s -> 11248.79s]  Almost halftime. Yeah. Coming up. I got him. I have to score at least once here.
[11257.42s -> 11276.73s]  Get a close enough for a field goal. It's hard to aim this.
[11284.17s -> 11288.09s]  Fucking god damn it. It's so hard to do that with the analog.
[11288.09s -> 11303.18s]  The analog is so sloppy. You have no idea how difficult that is to move that.
[11303.18s -> 11308.22s]  You can't. It moves so much. Trust me when I say that. That's not easy to do that.
[11309.10s -> 11322.54s]  No timeouts. I gotta get another fucking field goal. Another one right here. Debris.
[11324.82s -> 11330.20s]  Miss it. Of course they can do it perfect. AI's gonna do it fucking perfect every time.
[11336.36s -> 11338.04s]  Ah fuck. At least I get the ball.
[11351.46s -> 11359.06s]  The AI's not blaming its controller. No aiming with a field goal. Go get this game and do it
[11359.06s -> 11378.09s]  and we'll have a discussion about it. My defense is so good.
[11381.96s -> 11400.89s]  Very fucking down. Get across. Bingo. Right there. Just run it in.
[11400.89s -> 11407.70s]  We got good meter.
[11410.92s -> 11415.94s]  Almost there. Just walk it in. You know my favorite play.
[11425.64s -> 11431.54s]  Hey I got it. All that matters is the art.
[11451.43s -> 11468.31s]  Yeah I crossed the plane. We crossed the plane. We're good. Meter. See if I can get a fumble.
[11469.19s -> 11490.15s]  Where are we? Goal line. Balanced. Crush. No. Balanced. Safe to push. No dog shit.
[11490.95s -> 11496.82s]  It's a close game. It's gonna stay that way. And that was my tackle when I was supposed to
[11496.82s -> 11524.58s]  get him. He snuck right through and got like 10 yards. No field goal. No more game. No first
[11524.58s -> 11535.19s]  down. Thank you very much. I'll take it. Yes. It took too long to throw it.
[11536.07s -> 11543.78s]  Before you know it those kids are in the grind. What the hell is he talking about?
[11544.74s -> 11560.84s]  Almost. Fourth quarter. Division two championship. I am focused. I'm alert and I'm ready.
[11566.54s -> 11585.02s]  Second and 24. Let's try to get a quick pass over here on the left. How could you let that
[11585.02s -> 11605.37s]  happen? Yes.
[11618.41s -> 11624.49s]  21-13. He needs a touchdown and a two-point conversion. Or it's over. And I win the
[11625.37s -> 11633.11s]  goddamn championship. No bullshit. No bogus plays where he runs back the whole thing.
[11633.91s -> 11656.70s]  First down and 30. I can try to strip it. That's perfect. That's exactly what I needed right now.
[11657.42s -> 11675.70s]  That's two interceptions. Las Vegas leads by eight. Who is that? No not Sullivan again.
[11677.59s -> 11684.14s]  No this is the championship game. I can't lose him for like five games again. Okay don't
[11684.14s -> 11700.23s]  blow this. He'll come back in like three plays. One play. Thank god. That would have
[11700.23s -> 11704.63s]  been the whole game probably if I fucked that up. Nice. Can't let them catch their breath. I say
[11704.63s -> 11725.46s]  we test the corner. Second and goal. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Going for my favorite play
[11725.46s -> 11746.12s]  right in the middle. Just sneak it in. Third and goal. That's how you get hurt but it's okay.
[11750.76s -> 11778.78s]  28-13. Just round the clock. They made all these sound effects with him mouth.
[11779.34s -> 11794.23s]  That'd be actually pretty ridiculous. It'd be 31 if I made that field goal. We don't need it
[11794.23s -> 11801.61s]  though. First down 30 yards to go. I made up for the fact that we don't need that field goal.
[11802.49s -> 11819.85s]  Powerball. That goes to their quarterback. Brew's kidney. Out for three plays and that's
[11819.85s -> 11823.61s]  going to be the three plays that you need the most. So you definitely lost.
[11825.05s -> 11846.12s]  Try to do. Let's hurt this guy too. No ball explosion. We've seen it like three or four
[11846.12s -> 11862.15s]  times tonight though. Third and short for this offense. Damn it. It's all right. Let him have
[11862.15s -> 11880.02s]  one. And he's in the end zone. I'm just going to run the clock out and the game's going
[11880.02s -> 11920.84s]  to end. It's the very end of the game. It's all right. Nice. What do we want to do here?
[11920.84s -> 11938.82s]  Just run. Burn the timeouts. Oh my fucking god. It's okay. It's going to be for like
[11938.82s -> 11945.03s]  the whole season. Seven games but there's no more games to play. Don't just injure my whole
[11945.03s -> 11958.68s]  team and make this fucking whole thing. Oh Jesus Christ. You didn't even aim. You aimed for the
[11958.68s -> 11967.14s]  head. That's half back half back. How many half backs do I have? Why do you guys have to share
[11967.14s -> 11975.00s]  the same problem? Who's the half back now? Just give it to them. Who the fuck is this? Peter?
[11978.17s -> 11987.16s]  Fuck. It's fourth down. Am I in field goal range? Am I about to fucking have a meltdown?
[11987.16s -> 12008.34s]  All right. What was wrong with that? What was wrong with that?
[12020.70s -> 12024.46s]  This is not good. All they need is a touchdown and they're not going to get it.
[12032.97s -> 12046.46s]  Yes. Dead. That was Williams. That was the star quarterback.
[12047.02s -> 12057.22s]  That should seal the deal right there. Now just play prevention. Just play smart.
[12061.05s -> 12070.14s]  This quarterback sucks. Oh my fucking god.
[12083.77s -> 12093.14s]  Not this time. Same deal. Just man. Just prevent. Just cover everything. Just stay out.
[12093.86s -> 12096.28s]  Last play of the game.
[12101.19s -> 12103.83s]  Fuck you game over. I win championship. Division two championship.
[12114.39s -> 12137.32s]  More touchdowns. I unlocked everything. Moving on to D1. LT session. Loader. Silver.
[12141.08s -> 12153.64s]  New touchdown code. Circle XX circle is pylon kick. Finally took long enough. It took
[12153.64s -> 12157.32s]  six and a half hours for me to get a new one. More than that.
[12166.01s -> 12168.20s]  Uh oh. Here comes the scumbag.
[12186.65s -> 12188.73s]  Oh shit. Here it comes.
[12221.37s -> 12223.29s]  The LA Riot.
[12225.72s -> 12232.65s]  Oh wow. Is that what we just won? We just won the championship. That doesn't make any sense.
[12233.85s -> 12238.92s]  They didn't win the championship. What's up Carl?
[12249.16s -> 12249.72s]  Oh yes.
[12249.72s -> 12258.15s]  Yes. Absolutely. The draft. There it is. We get to pick a new player.
[12259.11s -> 12277.56s]  Remember this guy from prison? Right defensive end. Look at this. No this is it. I just can
[12277.56s -> 12286.52s]  either accept him or not accept him. Look at that speed agility. I just get him. A hundred
[12286.52s -> 12294.73s]  resist injury. He's never gonna get hurt. Yeah. I can't select anybody else right? There's no
[12294.73s -> 12300.79s]  other options. It's just this. Let's go.
[12314.41s -> 12325.61s]  200 plus combined yards. All right here we're in D1. Just to make sure everyone's in the right
[12325.61s -> 12344.44s]  spot. Quarterback. That's me. Halfback got Sullivan. Ashford sure has kind of climbed
[12344.44s -> 12353.93s]  the rankings here. A minus. A plus punter. Whenever you have to use him. Let's take a
[12353.93s -> 12370.97s]  look. Cruz and Tirpitz. This is a pretty great team. I'm happy about it. Mexico City
[12370.97s -> 12377.94s]  Aztecs is the next team. Let's see what I got. Plus six hands plus two speed.
[12378.90s -> 12392.58s]  Okay I don't have enough money to do anything. I don't think so at least. No. Resist injury.
[12394.66s -> 12402.17s]  Yeah massage therapy that's maxed out now. All right let's go.
[12410.73s -> 12418.76s]  Well that is a create a character cheat team. Good luck. I'm not betting any money here.
[12429.05s -> 12468.84s]  We're gonna get our asses kicked. We're gonna lose real bad. That's the spirit. This is D1.
[12469.56s -> 12488.28s]  Tight end. I gotta win five games. And thanks for joining us. 200 plus combined yards this game.
[12492.60s -> 12495.48s]  The heat is a factor. You see the uh the waves there.
[12504.87s -> 12509.99s]  No he made it here on time. Corner look. First down 30 yards to go. That haze.
[12509.99s -> 12525.99s]  26 yard line. I wonder how that affects. Heat is a factor in Mexico but not in Las Vegas.
[12526.07s -> 12535.59s]  Yeah I'm not sure how. I'm gonna go with go with a good pass here.
[12538.12s -> 12547.05s]  I might just sneak over. What the hell was that? Damn it. I thought I could sneak over there.
[12558.73s -> 12565.82s]  Out of my way. The dive seems to work a lot for me.
[12566.46s -> 12573.40s]  Cut across. Cut across. Cut across. Thank you.
[12586.94s -> 12593.96s]  That's a beautiful juke from Sullivan. What's it? What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it?
[12593.96s -> 12597.32s]  Wow that was fast. I think he broke the sound barrier. Well you know that's like at the
[12597.32s -> 12601.24s]  air show where they fly by and they're already gone before the sound of them hits your ears.
[12601.24s -> 12606.12s]  You ever see that? Well it wasn't that fast but but for not having wings or a jet engine
[12606.36s -> 12630.30s]  What a great unlockable that was. He just kicks the pylon. Stay him. So now with their possession
[12630.94s -> 12646.02s]  you've got to be aware of a guy who has a tight end right. He shed this guy
[12646.02s -> 12651.59s]  nearly exactly what he's doing here. Wait no no. I just don't want to do him in the ass.
[12651.59s -> 12660.54s]  I want to do it in the back. I would have I would have broken his spine. I tried to do it
[12660.54s -> 12682.90s]  and it just looked out. First down and third. Number 81. Watch 81. D1 is gonna be hell.
[12693.34s -> 12697.98s]  Miraculously still hands on. That's the end of the first quarter as Las Vegas leads by seven.
[12703.85s -> 12717.85s]  Blitz him. I see what you're doing. How the hell did you. I got tricked.
[12718.57s -> 12720.41s]  He tricked me. I thought it was gonna be a handoff run.
[12737.90s -> 12744.87s]  Oh that's all right. Tie game. Who kicked the ball?
[12755.34s -> 12759.02s]  You want to get tricked? Fine. I'm gonna do a snowflake. I don't even know what this does.
[12762.28s -> 12771.29s]  Um I didn't even do that. He ran to the left on his own.
[12773.78s -> 12780.01s]  Oh this sucks.
[12790.20s -> 12792.28s]  I blame snowflake. That's what I blame for real.
[12798.14s -> 12804.78s]  And how. Excuse me gentlemen. How do you not catch that? It was right to you. It was right
[12804.78s -> 12816.04s]  to you. I blocked 81. I took him out and the ball was thrown right to your hands. Fumble.
[12817.43s -> 12817.91s]  Thank you.
[12834.70s -> 12846.31s]  Let's try it wrong. First and 30. That's not good. Oh that's not good.
[12847.03s -> 12857.38s]  Sullivan again. Beru's kidney. Get a good injection. He should be fine in about three plays.
[12859.06s -> 12860.98s]  I don't want to hurt you with this needle. Good enough.
[12861.94s -> 12869.24s]  Oh hey hey. Why aren't they showing the announcer's face?
[12870.38s -> 12883.54s]  They're all over. Probably extra money. Second to 25. Yes. Oh first down.
[12883.54s -> 12888.34s]  Las Vegas had everyone on the same page there and they are rewarded with a very nice game.
[12890.71s -> 12894.95s]  The offense is going to get the ball and he's going to get off. He's going to get his
[12896.55s -> 12898.15s]  t-bone shattered. Whatever the hell that is.
[12898.15s -> 12910.34s]  So we've managed to run for like uh hmm. Dragon downfield player. Good. You good to go?
[12912.38s -> 12922.23s]  With under a minute to play in the half we're all tied up. Is it third and 15?
[12923.03s -> 12928.47s]  Whoa is it possible we're making progress? While we're at it let's try scoring.
[12929.59s -> 12931.82s]  Gotta make something happen.
[12932.14s -> 12937.18s]  And it's incomplete.
[12943.27s -> 12951.83s]  Fuck it. It's goddamn division one. You gotta make plays. Exactly what I'm talking about.
[12961.64s -> 12975.34s]  He has the same five lines. John Madden too has the same five lines. Now I know why somebody
[12975.34s -> 12980.82s]  said can you please mute him. I was like what are they talking about? Now I get it.
[12989.96s -> 12993.90s]  First down. Three yards to go. I'll buy a touchdown.
[12996.74s -> 13004.95s]  Mexico City with a nice game there thanks to some key downfield blocks.
[13005.99s -> 13020.58s]  Uh I blew that one. That was actually botched. Um how did you still throw it?
[13020.58s -> 13025.78s]  Touchdown. Mexico City. If that's me as the quarterback how do you throw that perfect throw?
[13026.10s -> 13033.75s]  Okay. Let's watch. So he gets fucking tackled and then underhand throws the ball perfectly
[13033.75s -> 13047.18s]  with the guy downfield. It is six points. I don't understand. I almost had it. The extra
[13047.18s -> 13065.48s]  point is good and once again we're all even. It's D1. Goddamn D1. Not gonna win that one.
[13065.48s -> 13078.62s]  Let's give Snowflake another chance. I'm never doing that play ever again.
[13078.62s -> 13082.30s]  There's a guy who's in pain from a big hit. How do you know? I don't see him crying or
[13082.30s -> 13085.74s]  anything but that's probably because he's crying on the inside. That's the kind of guy he is.
[13085.74s -> 13089.42s]  And after the game the trainers got to open him up blow dry his spleen or something like that.
[13091.58s -> 13094.22s]  I went the wrong way. The computer had control.
[13098.31s -> 13101.43s]  When he gets the ball he runs to the left. I don't have control of the game.
[13102.90s -> 13106.90s]  He takes control and runs left and then gets tackled by the same guy every time.
[13109.93s -> 13113.13s]  I have not had control of the character every time I've done that play.
[13118.20s -> 13127.61s]  Runs to the left and gets tackled. Always going for the guys like balls.
[13140.52s -> 13177.11s]  Do a balanced D I think. I saw that one coming from by the way in 26. I was waiting for you.
[13178.47s -> 13192.18s]  Although they're pretty close though. Third and seven. Incomplete pass. Here we go and then
[13192.18s -> 13204.04s]  they're gonna kick it. That was fucking brutal. That was brutal and we got the ball and it's
[13204.04s -> 13221.75s]  a touchdown. Has to be. Six plays. Has the best possible scenario here. I'm gonna say
[13222.79s -> 13236.25s]  clear. I don't even know what play it is. It's gut check time. That's stupid.
[13241.54s -> 13252.81s]  I really like this play. The corner look. Watch that unleashed. Here comes not 28 please.
[13256.34s -> 13267.29s]  Not no not Sullivan. No he's going forever. Ruptured scrotum. Five games. I need him in the
[13267.29s -> 13293.05s]  game right now. That's not good. This is bad. Okay it's an easy kick. Perfect right?
[13295.35s -> 13296.55s]  That almost didn't go through.
[13303.32s -> 13307.32s]  I know I'm supposed to wear them. I'm expected to wear them but something keeps telling me not
[13307.32s -> 13322.38s]  to trust them. Good night. Broken column. You gotta be up at least five games.
[13328.18s -> 13332.68s]  Got a fresh unleash. Let's kill the quarterback.
[13333.75s -> 13345.59s]  I'm going for it. I'm just blitzing. Fuck it. Fuck I thought I had it. Oh I thought I had
[13345.59s -> 13350.07s]  it. I really thought I did. If that were me out there running it would probably make people
[13350.71s -> 13356.47s]  I really thought it was gonna happen. Good job safety. Big series of downs upcoming.
[13356.47s -> 13359.91s]  I thought I had it. That was a given. It was a given that I was gonna get that.
[13368.30s -> 13376.57s]  It's beautiful. I don't got a good halfback.
[13379.66s -> 13394.58s]  First down and 30. Kane you fucking idiot. I was about to say that was great but it
[13394.58s -> 13397.78s]  wasn't. It was awful. It was just awful.
[13413.00s -> 13416.12s]  I'm so mad about that fumble because that was the turnaround of the game right there.
[13431.34s -> 13435.10s]  This isn't gonna be another one of those games or I'm gonna be down by three or four points.
[13435.82s -> 13437.02s]  How many times is that gonna happen?
[13444.33s -> 13449.58s]  Thank you. All right Dupree and that's a touchback. We'll see if their defense can hold.
[13450.54s -> 13458.28s]  No it's okay. That's okay. There's been a guy that's been intercepting the all game.
[13459.24s -> 13462.09s]  You know what fuck it. We're going with an unleash catch.
[13466.30s -> 13468.86s]  That's a guaranteed catch. Eat shit touchdown.
[13474.33s -> 13478.02s]  Las Vegas tears up a good chunk of field there and you know what I'm doing.
[13481.86s -> 13507.59s]  Thank god. What's worse this or beer chunk. I wonder. Everybody was so desperate to get a
[13507.59s -> 13541.37s]  different celebration. Now you have pylon kick. Keep giving franchise yards. Just got stuffed
[13541.37s -> 13550.52s]  and that would have been a touchdown. First and 30. Who the fuck is franchise? I don't
[13550.52s -> 13566.36s]  know who Mr. Super Bowl is. Good let him run the clock. Let him go down the field as long
[13566.36s -> 13572.73s]  as they want. It's impossible for them to get anymore and then I just got to not throw any
[13572.73s -> 13576.97s]  interceptions. Just run the ball around the clock. Game's over. First division one game complete.
[13590.87s -> 13593.99s]  This is fine. I don't care how many points you score right now.
[13604.60s -> 13610.12s]  That's a guarantee. He guaranteed it. It's fine. He used his unleash.
[13611.08s -> 13613.64s]  Doesn't matter how many points he gets. I have a ball.
[13614.36s -> 13627.02s]  How long is this gonna be? It is 20 at best. Yeah see the 44 seconds just run every play.
[13630.68s -> 13634.20s]  Don't do anything. No unleash. Don't do anything stupid. Run the ball.
[13635.16s -> 13637.56s]  And it looks like they'll try an onside kick here.
[13643.16s -> 13648.71s]  Easy. There's my halfback in the game. Okay no incompletions. Keep it between the
[13648.71s -> 13655.85s]  lines and keep the clock running. Easy right? Yeah that's what I said. First down. All right
[13655.85s -> 13664.07s]  Cox you have to really pull through here. Take the time out. And then you got your can't get
[13664.07s -> 13667.83s]  a date to the problem. You have one more time out. What do you think about it? I'm not the
[13667.83s -> 13671.75s]  best looking corsage on the lapel. So in a way you think about it it's kind of beautiful
[13671.75s -> 13676.79s]  or at least it's the kind of ugly only a mother could find. Does that make sense?
[13676.79s -> 13683.03s]  That's fine. You don't know about the damage till days or weeks later you just sit there
[13683.03s -> 13688.31s]  eating lunch all of a sudden you just start screaming. Third and now let's just call it third
[13688.31s -> 13701.29s]  in a ways. Why did where's he running? Oh excuse me. Excuse me. I did not do that.
[13703.83s -> 13710.97s]  He just started running. Why the fuck did you do that? Oh shit.
[13722.22s -> 13741.03s]  You got to be kidding me. I'm panicking. Guys they don't have any time outs. I'm about to have
[13741.03s -> 13746.25s]  an unleashed. All right there's no reason why they get the ball to the hands-off with an
[13746.25s -> 13752.63s]  unleashed. Not a single reason with me with an unleashed full meter. You don't have any more
[13752.63s -> 13761.53s]  time outs. The person that gets the ball is dead. Un-fucking-belief. They don't have any
[13761.53s -> 13767.21s]  time. It's over. Good luck. I don't know what play I'm gonna pick. Maybe I should pick.
[13767.93s -> 13774.18s]  Oh wait what? First down 30 yards to go. This is their last play.
[13783.08s -> 13798.14s]  Fuck you. That was so close. I was so scared. I had to wait to the last second because he
[13798.14s -> 13807.40s]  was doing a clash catch. That would have been so disappointing. But that's the first
[13807.40s -> 13823.42s]  game in division one complete. I only have $290,000. That's not good. Pronghorn gear
[13824.22s -> 13830.94s]  unlocked. Yeah that was just the first one. I have to win four more games
[13831.58s -> 13834.38s]  and then I get to go to the absolute complete championship.
[13836.97s -> 13841.37s]  franchise this is grace i hope you don't mind me being forward but seeing as we're working

[14306.41s -> 14308.65s]  there you go you're all right buddy get out there
[14313.77s -> 14321.37s]  going to triangle goes way down field and it's hauled in the 25 yard line i can't believe you
[14321.37s -> 14330.74s]  got that good job happy 56 birthday keep it going keep it going they've given themselves
[14330.74s -> 14341.90s]  a great opportunity here in the red zone if the ball would have gotten to the defender
[14341.90s -> 14347.42s]  come on man we're gonna do this all day let's get up man let's cut this left corner
[14356.39s -> 14378.90s]  all right you know what i'm doing it works every time six more points let's take a two
[14378.90s -> 14388.22s]  on one division why do americans like this stupid sport i don't know why does anybody like
[14388.22s -> 14415.51s]  any sport a lot of people like golf a lot of people like to fish you know unleash i'd rather
[14415.51s -> 14422.22s]  watch wii bowling well you're about to watch somebody beat the championship and get to the
[14422.22s -> 14432.89s]  super bowl and win it's not the way incomplete that's too bad the offense has a ways to go
[14432.89s -> 14440.17s]  here on second down i tried to turn around and catch it injury there's the injury i was
[14440.17s -> 14460.97s]  looking for that get man that's a new sponsor stay down there goes your star player good
[14461.93s -> 14463.66s]  now i can relax a little
[14474.84s -> 14486.71s]  the backup is better that'd be really odd we need to stop them right here right now
[14492.10s -> 14495.94s]  i just assume they go for it because i go for it 75 percent of the time
[14497.14s -> 14513.34s]  what are these colors for are they're supposed to be my colors like my channel colors
[14514.30s -> 14516.49s]  somehow
[14519.06s -> 14524.42s]  who gets the ball
[14535.88s -> 14537.00s]  you're not going to get away with this
[14558.10s -> 14565.08s]  all right unleash a lot of the good starting players are gone so that's good
[14565.88s -> 14587.58s]  i'm up on third down right third and 22 third down and long gets near i don't think
[14587.58s -> 14595.32s]  he knows what is the new beer chub they go for field goal field goal blocked right oh no they're
[14595.32s -> 14604.55s]  not oh no no no no no no no no no no this is not good um good at least five or six
[14604.55s -> 14624.15s]  people touched that he was bouncing around on everybody i got one more play here to try
[14624.63s -> 14631.46s]  should i just get a field goal or should i go for it field goal be safe safe field goal
[14633.91s -> 14644.07s]  now fuck it we're going for it first and goal it's gut check time end zone
[14645.99s -> 14652.25s]  should have just got a fucking field goal and so at halftime los vegas leads by seven
[14656.76s -> 14660.84s]  somebody fucking called me a bus so i had to do it i looked over and was like oh you
[14660.84s -> 14672.22s]  baby okay
[14679.86s -> 14691.29s]  first down 30 yards to go
[14692.82s -> 14709.83s]  defense could taste that oh that was outrageous that was a trick play it was so tricky nobody
[14709.83s -> 14726.09s]  knew what the fuck happened new set of downs you already know what i'm doing defense backed
[14726.09s -> 14760.66s]  up to their own goal line franchise brings the dinner bell again 27 good beer chug to nose
[14761.62s -> 14766.22s]  i would say of all the mistakes in my life and there have been a couple you know eating
[14766.22s -> 14770.22s]  bananas with jalapenos makes is one of the biggest and a girl in san diego
[14773.18s -> 14774.70s]  apparently that's a mistake somehow
[14783.08s -> 14789.29s]  that's how you do john men he does the talk with a kind of a high voice at first
[14790.39s -> 14793.27s]  oh my fucking god i'm talking and that's why i fucked it up
[14793.43s -> 14800.10s]  and i need focus they are rewarded with a very nice game first and goal it's gut check time
[14800.10s -> 14808.15s]  ball up the 22 yard line never had a chance he got
[14813.03s -> 14834.28s]  reversal that's fine that doesn't sound like madden at all
[14835.48s -> 14840.87s]  it does if you tried to take a guess who that was who would you say that was
[14842.20s -> 14849.77s]  okay ready who am i if you never heard that
[14860.86s -> 14888.22s]  you all right let's do it you see how lightning my reflexes just were right there
[14889.02s -> 14904.68s]  oh i had to do this right the first time hold on try and hold still buddy
[14908.20s -> 14918.39s]  it's all right i was in a bad run holy good thing he's got insurance
[14930.36s -> 14938.49s]  los vegas gets it back and so with three quarters gone
[14938.49s -> 14943.77s]  los vegas leads by seven i'm pretty convinced that the trick plays are only in the game
[14943.85s -> 14945.37s]  for when you play against another human
[14946.97s -> 14953.27s]  friend of yours seems like a hell of a lot more than eight that's not it doesn't fool the computer
[14970.94s -> 14975.67s]  i have to go for a clash catch here even if it's turnover
[14975.91s -> 14976.31s]  i don't care
[14982.95s -> 15007.48s]  that was really really important it helps me seal it you know that they're an awful
[15007.48s -> 15028.30s]  friend when they make you play this game this is a this game is great see if i can
[15028.30s -> 15040.89s]  get the ball here worth a shot fourth quarter up by a lot first down and 30

[15062.36s -> 15080.86s]  maybe get an injury for the third girlfriend no i already did it i took this star player out
[15080.86s -> 15091.77s]  of the game in like the first quarter what are you gonna do on fourth down a minute to go
[15091.77s -> 15097.05s]  you're definitely going to go for it safety blitz
[15100.81s -> 15104.73s]  seven yard line and he's brought down and they turn the ball over now they could have
[15104.73s -> 15109.61s]  used some points right there franchise didn't franchise dude no way big stop there
[15110.73s -> 15113.61s]  i thought i did with franchise first and 30
[15116.95s -> 15128.98s]  your team looks like the arizona iced tea no it's germa 985

[15444.31s -> 15449.90s]  team that look at those stats how do you go oh and two must win by more than six points
[15449.90s -> 15455.26s]  let's just max better this week we're matched up against arizona division one title contenders
[15455.26s -> 15461.18s]  with a passing game it's hard to stop my receiver tito moss is their number one barebone
[15461.18s -> 15466.70s]  threat little shit's been in the league 10 years now and he's just as quick and just as
[15466.70s -> 15474.49s]  dirty fortunately for us their defense can't stop anybody or we'd be screwed terrible defense
[15474.97s -> 15491.74s]  good wish i had the best halfback in the league he just did the look of me did he
[15496.98s -> 15508.14s]  they have an awful running game so just gonna play zones thanks for joining us
[15521.50s -> 15532.94s]  every game we've played tonight only lost once i don't know why i just said that considering
[15533.74s -> 15546.22s]  i'm gonna jinx it bad yard knock on wood right yeah
[15549.50s -> 15562.86s]  all right cox uh-oh i thought the defense was supposed to suck
[15563.90s -> 15566.06s]  the defense will be coming here on third long
[15571.37s -> 15578.15s]  he sure didn't try to be nice thought i could throw it still fuck it let's go
[15579.03s -> 15601.50s]  this is what bill balachek would do let's go that's not good
[15602.38s -> 15609.75s]  keeper gets taken out before the ball gets near him i don't think he knows what hit him
[15616.76s -> 15626.28s]  really thought i caught him on the bond literally not what bill balachek would do on the first
[15626.28s -> 15648.34s]  possession i would have had it too i've got to cover this guy thank you very much
[15649.14s -> 15661.02s]  get out of the end zone all right what would bill balachek do right now
[15661.82s -> 15667.08s]  you can kick a field goal no don't make a fucking shitty joke let's go
[15669.88s -> 15674.34s]  first down and 30 ball at the six yards where
[15675.62s -> 15686.10s]  los vegas really executed on that play and took a big step down the field nice work
[15693.18s -> 15703.05s]  franchise demonstrating why he's considered one of the all right 24 yards i'll take it
[15704.33s -> 15719.02s]  again do it again they have uh oh they have an unleash okay i'll take the hit that's the end
[15719.02s -> 15725.85s]  of the first quarter as we're scoreless is your planning on finishing the game story
[15726.57s -> 15737.32s]  we're pretty close we're at i mean there's only three games left in the division i can't
[15737.32s -> 15746.86s]  now run out of bounds he did a great job of finding the hole and bursting through first
[15746.86s -> 15764.01s]  and goal it's gut check time ball at the three yard line so got it you think someone
[15764.01s -> 15767.93s]  would have a playbook on me right now every time he gets to within five yards of the end
[15767.93s -> 15772.97s]  zone he jumps with the quarterback that was pretty somebody tell me why we can't do that
[15772.97s -> 15800.02s]  in every position it always works every time what is good oops easy no injury here
[15800.66s -> 15811.64s]  i will build up points though do another p break i don't have to be yet it hasn't been a
[15812.36s -> 15819.51s]  quarterly first and 30 it's only been what like an hour usually p three to four times
[15824.46s -> 15825.98s]  that's the guy that catches every ball
[15832.97s -> 15848.28s]  i p like every two hours injury he's getting weak p right now do it right now i'm in the
[15848.28s -> 15872.31s]  middle of a game i'm in the middle of a game heard him just comes easy to this guy
[15872.31s -> 15877.03s]  sure he works hard he has talent but that's what makes these sorts of plays so easy for
[15877.03s -> 15880.95s]  bravo it's the coach's favorite place on the field the red zone
[15882.71s -> 15892.63s]  end zone yes yes three and own division one let's go let's do it
[15894.07s -> 15908.78s]  first down yards to go intercepted didn't i just fucking upgrade hands is there a reason why
[15908.78s -> 15915.21s]  it's bouncing out of every but it's it has bounced 50 of every pass i've thrown this game
[15915.77s -> 15923.13s]  big series of downs upcoming we just got hands to level three is something wrong with you
[15924.25s -> 15948.92s]  that's my passing two just deflate the ball i'm going for it down and goal to go don't let him do
[15948.92s -> 15961.21s]  the thing that i do damn it the way he put that ball on target come on block this you've done
[15961.21s -> 15976.76s]  it like three times and so we're tied who gets the ball i never i don't even remember
[15977.56s -> 16004.71s]  i think they do i think they get the ball it's getting a little hairy here okay triple coverage
[16004.71s -> 16018.22s]  to him oh why do i continue to do this that's not gonna matter they're not gonna get it's
[16018.22s -> 16031.64s]  gonna be fine they're not gonna get it you can pretend all you want just kick it off again
[16032.28s -> 16038.44s]  and so at halftime we're tied what do i have for dinner today i had pork chop
[16038.44s -> 16058.74s]  it's pretty good it was delicious hold them here they're gonna have an unleash in about
[16058.74s -> 16085.34s]  30 seconds i don't want to have to play ketchup to stop smash out for the whole game
[16089.26s -> 16104.23s]  yeah pork chop and a little bit of couscous it was great don't hold on wait
[16107.06s -> 16116.41s]  you youngsters out there what the run after the catch is important the first thing you have to do
[16116.41s -> 16122.22s]  is catch the ball and secure it he showed you how to do it right there for all you youngsters
[16124.14s -> 16130.42s]  they didn't really get that much yardage either they didn't get a first down
[16131.46s -> 16136.41s]  that is here but don't let them get a touchdown they get they get they get
[16136.41s -> 16140.41s]  yes yes yes they don't have anything they don't need to clash what a fucking blunder
[16140.41s -> 16161.27s]  that i didn't capitalize on yes i did fumble it again there he goes six games goodbye always
[16161.27s -> 16164.95s]  go for the water balloon yeah put some if you bust this spleen they're always out for at least
[16164.95s -> 16174.57s]  three full games it's the best thing that could have happened good yes it is the defender was
[16174.57s -> 16178.81s]  in the right place at the right time it was able to snag his second interception of the
[16178.81s -> 16180.81s]  game first down 30 yards to go
[16204.86s -> 16222.02s]  that almost ready two more chug yeah he's doing the chug again i wish he would do
[16222.02s -> 16234.79s]  anything else but chug one more no two more dirty hits and
[16238.23s -> 16266.04s]  i'm gonna strip that ball run it back for a touchdown good the question is do i let them
[16267.98s -> 16273.06s]  second 31 hmm we'll see i'm gonna stay back
[16277.37s -> 16284.39s]  they're in 22 he's still got a long way to go
[16300.15s -> 16307.72s]  this is where they unravel and 30 check this out
[16312.44s -> 16325.35s]  it's a guaranteed touchdown and i'll just stay ahead they can boo me all they want
[16326.07s -> 16337.67s]  i'm gonna come away with a victory and the extra point is good easy game yeah i'm at d1
[16339.78s -> 16350.10s]  well you guys don't have to boo me it's huge what an explosive tackle
[16361.82s -> 16367.98s]  taken out of the play and that's in between did i bet on this i don't need to be win by like
[16367.98s -> 16376.55s]  how many did i bet i think i did like 13 grand right he's going long and complete defender
[16376.55s -> 16380.87s]  made sure there was no receiver there to make the catch as we reach the end of the third
[16380.87s -> 16387.75s]  quarter las vegas leads by 14 come on man i can't believe i'm gonna beat blitz the league
[16387.75s -> 16412.09s]  two on spring add that to things i never thought i was going to do but i love it i'm having a lot
[16412.09s -> 16423.59s]  of fun it is a classic he's gonna pass the guy up here oh watch out puts it up and it's complete
[16423.59s -> 16428.79s]  after 48 out of bounds and that'll end this offensive series you can see how pumped up the
[16428.79s -> 16438.57s]  defense is after that big stop first and 30 all the way to 48 yard line make sure he doesn't
[16438.89s -> 16455.08s]  get that that was really sloppy second down and about a mile not bad that was dumb as hell yeah
[16455.08s -> 16468.97s]  it was we have a long day ahead of us check it ready out of bounds out of bounds out of
[16468.97s -> 16483.78s]  bounds right up in the middle this offense can smell the end zone runs it outside oh you know
[16483.78s -> 16505.59s]  what i'm gonna do be stopped i love it i love how it works there's not much you can do
[16505.59s -> 16519.72s]  against that though if i'm honest when you only need to go one inch point is good all right i'm
[16519.72s -> 16533.22s]  getting overconfident here i'm gonna be three and oh in division one just too much confidence
[16533.22s -> 16542.10s]  he's gonna have way too much confidence destroying who are supposed to be the division one
[16542.10s -> 16578.52s]  champions 36 seven good luck thank you for getting that because i didn't i wouldn't have
[16580.87s -> 16586.15s]  let's just be assholes okay let's do special teams just field goal blocks fucking who cares
[16587.11s -> 16590.87s]  right now like the the offensive coach of the defensive coast are laughing their asses off
[16603.88s -> 16612.17s]  what arrogance first down 30 yards to go a high five and they're shaking hands already
[16613.37s -> 16625.13s]  this is why you leave this guy back here another collarbone for you
[16632.31s -> 16641.82s]  collarbone bm stay down and let's let's end it with uh another punt return fuck it
[16650.92s -> 16658.81s]  dragged around and threw him on tornado just try i'm i'm trying i'm trying to do it i haven't
[16661.24s -> 16668.02s]  tried to do the quarterback rip his ankle up oh my god

[16752.18s -> 16758.26s]  wanting to win the championship there's only one way that can happen you and me got to start
[16758.26s -> 16768.30s]  playing together not just on the field at the same time together what's done is done hey man
[16768.30s -> 16774.71s]  i fucked up all right but if we work tight we could nail the commissioner and win the title
[16774.71s -> 16781.77s]  in the process nailed a commissioner don't you work for him not anymore now i just want to bring
[16781.77s -> 16798.76s]  him down hard so we cool they're really really odd body types what's with the shoulders and the
[16798.76s -> 16805.42s]  stomachs and stuff it's weird i know what it is i'm just kidding jesus i hope you don't mind
[16805.42s -> 16809.66s]  but i took the liberty of having your team's training facilities updated that shoddy old
[16809.66s -> 16820.14s]  equipment was so out of date more equipment is bruno hey punk i think you didn't expect to
[16820.14s -> 16825.90s]  have to deal with me again after you won the division two championship well me and the riot
[16825.90s -> 16830.54s]  are here to stay okay we're against the riot franchise must get more sacks than bruno next
[16830.54s -> 16842.47s]  game this is burst the la riot okay we've got 350 not enough anybody injured i don't think i have
[16842.47s -> 16856.06s]  enough for anything 540 550 why does this have a star on it strange uh juicing is high risk
[16856.06s -> 16867.30s]  we're not going to do it i want to save money too what did i get well tackle break tackle
[16873.48s -> 16880.47s]  all right this is this is the storyline game the training facility has been upgraded oh okay
[16881.11s -> 16892.34s]  here we go la riot versus the vegas super bowls go pee i'll pee after this
[16893.30s -> 16914.63s]  hmm i'm not betting this stacked now all right i gotta be prepared for this you will lose if you
[16914.63s -> 16930.90s]  don't pee i want to pee it's all right we told you to go pee what time is it it's been

[16948.39s -> 16954.17s]  that's true that's why i didn't go pee because that's a that's a touchdown
[16955.29s -> 16967.80s]  that's bruno right i gotta watch out for i gotta watch out for bruno
[16975.42s -> 16979.13s]  shit i was trying to wait for the guy to get open
[16980.81s -> 17006.90s]  god damn it should have went fucking p oh my god damn it that's way too much i have to
[17006.90s -> 17022.76s]  punch this is the first punt i think i've ever done how does it work why is he running over here
[17024.95s -> 17032.71s]  uh come on i got it i did it
[17036.42s -> 17039.86s]  all right safety safety safety here comes the safety you gotta get a sack safety
[17054.07s -> 17059.86s]  i think i don't have a chance for safety how am i supposed to get sacks as a safety
[17060.74s -> 17081.38s]  i need to get one you still caught it you i can't i can't fucking believe it now
[17082.34s -> 17088.50s]  that's actually unbelievable los angeles really executed on that play and took a big step
[17088.50s -> 17092.10s]  i smashed him in the side and he fell down he got back up and caught the ball
[17093.38s -> 17103.67s]  just infuriated that's the end of the first quarter just splits every play i have to be for
[17103.67s -> 17111.80s]  brian i have to offense facing a second and goal here ball at the 33 yard line
[17111.80s -> 17126.86s]  oh boy he really took a shot let's see bladder weighing down wait till after the first quarter
[17126.86s -> 17133.48s]  second quarter i mean no wait till after this game juice on the net the offense might want
[17133.48s -> 17148.22s]  to mix it up here they've been a little predictable the first two downs it's always
[17148.22s -> 17157.48s]  the call of one every time three games going you're up that means you're not going to be
[17157.48s -> 17164.78s]  there for the championship game if you're there to kick in a field goal you're not going to
[17164.78s -> 17182.33s]  get it the field goal is good okay all right give me this good possession here if you don't
[17182.33s -> 17199.24s]  pee i'm going to take the playstation you can't get it it's chained to the desk
[17219.29s -> 17226.78s]  nice play sullivan excellent work oh they just can't even touch them talk this shit
[17226.78s -> 17232.06s]  build the meter nice

[17258.52s -> 17262.36s]  turn it over again get another touchdown it's that simple
[17263.24s -> 17296.30s]  collarbone three two one oh back three plays no that's not whatever first and
[17296.30s -> 17319.58s]  30 kind of wasted my meter there unfortunately it's a loss can we get self in the next germ
[17319.58s -> 17328.50s]  a rumble you don't want mr super bowl how could you not want mr super bowl
[17332.82s -> 17337.24s]  and almost caught it kind of went through the hands there everyone welcome
[17338.04s -> 17352.33s]  get robbie robbie died robbie's gone you're gonna punt you're gonna go for it i think you're
[17352.33s -> 17382.31s]  gonna punt yes you are i hate that uh empty let's do one of these weird rums down and 30
[17382.31s -> 17390.26s]  wall at the 50 yard line we've got a great halfback i'm telling you i'm telling you the
[17390.26s -> 17393.62s]  computer you can't do those weird trick plays against maybe you can do it against
[17393.62s -> 17399.64s]  your friend not the computer it's not gonna happen uh i got like one more play maybe
[17412.84s -> 17426.28s]  oh my god sullivan you're the fucking mvp for real wow definitely team mvp for sure
[17428.54s -> 17440.74s]  not down in my mind now he's blocked it and the extra point is good
[17443.48s -> 17448.20s]  and with the first half in the books las vegas leads by 11 do i get the ball too
[17451.70s -> 17468.31s]  well it's good that i just did that then oops it's time to yearn not yet he's gonna drop it
[17469.11s -> 17481.19s]  looks like a thunder las vegas makes the recovery this is very good we have to be we have to be
[17482.15s -> 17501.22s]  what happened did you see that why do they just roll over each other watch this oh it's not
[17501.22s -> 17522.94s]  enough oh well get the hat back in there give it to sullivan he's just i took three people
[17522.94s -> 17536.98s]  to get him down again this same play this time it's a touchdown how did that happen
[17538.07s -> 17546.28s]  i didn't even do that that guy just he went on his back how would your balls explode
[17549.00s -> 17555.78s]  las vegas hang on buddy he'd his pants here let me help you let me help you i'll tell you this
[17555.78s -> 17559.78s]  is great because storyline wise the riots are definitely going to be in the championship
[17560.58s -> 17565.64s]  like so seeing all these guys go down for more than six games
[17582.78s -> 17586.54s]  when all their starters are down for six games all they have is the backups
[17587.50s -> 17604.07s]  i need to injure their star player it's not this guy they might all just be in there
[17604.07s -> 17617.69s]  anyways yeah probably down 30 yards to go see if i can get a sack use defenders at his wake on
[17617.85s -> 17628.81s]  that one quite a gallop watch that unleash
[17634.04s -> 17650.97s]  who was that whatever we're gonna get one sprained neck shortstop yeah he's not gonna
[17650.97s -> 17657.35s]  be playing ball yeah he'll be fine hold on buddy hey get the card out take it easy buddy
[17657.35s -> 17671.48s]  it'll be over in a second he's dead no he just he just like did a kink in his neck
[17672.20s -> 17696.65s]  i've gotten pretty good at that does that count as a sack i don't think it does what
[17716.86s -> 17719.66s]  i don't even know how that happened he just kind of looking at first and
[17719.74s -> 17721.66s]  popped in there and knocked into my leg
[17731.69s -> 17735.05s]  oh shit no no no no no i didn't want to do that i wanted to die for it
[17761.77s -> 17780.66s]  pick it up better i'm gonna save money i have to get at least two or three things to level
[17780.66s -> 17786.10s]  three before the circle because at this rate i'm definitely gonna get in there
[17787.67s -> 17792.71s]  all right season ending career ending injuries three two one not to me though thank god
[17793.99s -> 17802.82s]  just get right back up las vegas comes up with a turnover as we reach the end of the
[17802.82s -> 17809.93s]  third quarter las vegas leads by 18 yes
[17815.90s -> 17816.70s]  30 yards to go
[17818.55s -> 17825.27s]  looking good uh there you are there you go memes coming in after an injury
[17833.54s -> 17838.57s]  let's see if the offense can keep it going here in the red zone
[17838.57s -> 17848.60s]  rodem rupture that was embarrassing no it wasn't it's fine i know what i'm doing
[17862.47s -> 17895.74s]  increases their lead ticket 34 i'm sad there is no sequel to this one this is what we get here
[17899.05s -> 17904.86s]  elbow hand wrist
[17904.86s -> 17923.46s]  six games put them all out of commission all of them let's do blitz need to get a sack
[17926.78s -> 17947.94s]  is that kind of a sack comes loose retains possession whatever all absolute chaos blitz
[17951.26s -> 17952.22s]  i'm going in for the kill
[17952.94s -> 17975.42s]  it's interesting you know what i'm doing
[17983.13s -> 17990.49s]  works every time i was coming in today i just the stadium was empty and i just stood in the
[17990.49s -> 17995.29s]  stands and yelled and i couldn't get no matter where i stood but you know the yelling felt
[17995.29s -> 18014.18s]  kind of good just to get it out here why is germa's team the color of every 90s birthday
[18014.18s -> 18021.14s]  party first down and 30 ball at the 28 i need to get a sack i need to focus sack
[18022.02s -> 18031.14s]  got it do it again and then i get the uh the victory just all outlets i don't even care if i
[18031.14s -> 18034.26s]  i don't care if they score three more touchdowns i need to get one more sack
[18054.25s -> 18061.50s]  get some monster yardage on that play they're in the red zone now time to capitalize get it
[18062.30s -> 18073.11s]  in zone come on i don't i need to sack the quarterback
[18073.11s -> 18077.03s]  has a real nose for the ball that's his second pick today here's the idea ready
[18086.10s -> 18107.46s]  catch it uh punt punt punt punt the ball no but that's gonna be too long i can't sack
[18107.46s -> 18112.84s]  i have to immediately get this guy on the ground just have it be awful
[18113.40s -> 18129.59s]  okay so see if i can kill this guy and so las vegas wins the game i actually got it how
[18130.55s -> 18139.74s]  didn't he get one we both got one did i get more than one i had to all right
[18141.27s -> 18154.60s]  make it from the field goal that's possible yeah nice new touchdown code square circle
[18154.60s -> 18171.74s]  triangle circle cool go back it up it's the second that's like the third time i've embarrassed
[18171.74s -> 18177.02s]  the la riot we're going to new york this sunday that means we get another shot at max
[18177.02s -> 18183.50s]  carson that kid those assholes drafted replace me we're gonna make them regret that shit so
[18183.50s -> 18189.02s]  prevent max carson from getting any sacks or injure carson with an unleashed power move next
[18189.02s -> 18198.23s]  game i get it you've got game maybe you ain't just some punk ass college wannabe but like i
[18198.23s -> 18209.70s]  told you earlier me and the riot shut up okay still got that girlfriend trainer upgrades
[18210.58s -> 18213.19s]  this is probably one of the last times i'm gonna be able to do this
[18214.07s -> 18224.71s]  what do you think strength passing break tackle this is so important i would say either passing
[18224.71s -> 18236.87s]  or break tackle passing passing agility yeah no passing yeah we're gonna do yeah
[18239.35s -> 18242.71s]  if i have enough money i got that they have to play two more games one more game to
[18242.71s -> 18248.12s]  clinch the playoffs the championship i should be able to do it one more time
[18251.27s -> 18256.55s]  we got keep the money i didn't need it except maybe yeah too much risk no don't even do it don't
[18256.55s -> 18264.74s]  don't waste any money nobody's injured everyone's good to go uh next game against the new york
[18264.74s -> 18273.24s]  nightmare and i will take a piss so everyone can take a piss and relax see you guys in like
[18273.24s -> 18414.36s]  two minutes y'all back did everybody pee i hope so new york nightmare hell let's go
[18414.36s -> 18427.69s]  win by 19 points no save money that's a really stacked team the new york nightmares linebacker
[18427.69s -> 18433.93s]  max carson is the second coming of quentin so hurt this guy fast strong and mean off the field
[18433.93s -> 18438.81s]  the comparisons to sands and carson keeps to himself that doesn't necessarily fit the new
[18438.81s -> 18451.14s]  york nightmare style no fast cars or fast women fans are complaining ow why would you do
[18451.14s -> 18461.22s]  something like that you're a professional football player you're trying to bench
[18461.30s -> 18473.59s]  yourself for the whole year don't do that wear gloves no focus but they have lots of
[18473.59s -> 18481.98s]  athleticism he's trying to be cool you just don't understand good evening everyone at
[18481.98s -> 18487.74s]  this point of the division i'm gonna injure carson with an unleashed move it sounds like
[18487.74s -> 18491.18s]  the easiest of all the things they can keep doing what they're doing and it looks like
[18491.18s -> 18503.27s]  we're set for the kickoff they look like the ravens the bells are gotta be ringing in his
[18503.59s -> 18506.95s]  yeah they really do look like the ravens how am i i gotta injure him with an unleashed move
[18511.45s -> 18516.25s]  so i have to get unleashed and then stop him and hope i break his neck
[18519.29s -> 18519.93s]  it's gonna be hard
[18528.84s -> 18538.49s]  third down let's go with hop and pop
[18538.49s -> 18546.14s]  oh no no no no not the hand not the hand
[18547.26s -> 18554.42s]  uh not the hand it's probably been six fucking games give me a break
[18555.38s -> 18569.40s]  fourth and eight what would bill belichick do he'd go for it
[18570.78s -> 18571.42s]  his face
[18574.30s -> 18577.66s]  the quarterback needs to make sure his throw gets there before the defender i think
[18578.78s -> 18582.86s]  that's uh degrading to me that i'm like degraded right now because of that
[18584.06s -> 18593.11s]  out again for six fucking games it's very bad this is nothing we might lose this thing
[18600.31s -> 18604.57s]  sullivan out on first possession oh yeah sullivan comes in for a game
[18605.45s -> 18612.01s]  in the first minute of the game breaks his wrist he's out for two games comes back in scores like
[18612.01s -> 18626.30s]  four touchdowns breaks his wrist again and is up for like another two games boy is he fantastic
[18626.30s -> 18636.17s]  when he gets to play but i don't know how much time he's had on the field versus off
[18636.97s -> 18642.54s]  you know here's what i'm first down and 30 i'm in trouble here they have an unleashed
[18643.50s -> 18653.61s]  oh no tricks

[19878.04s -> 19889.08s]  we ought to give his all-star trophy to his lawyers of course they leave the last like three
[19889.08s -> 19905.80s]  teams are the hard ones the new england regulators just won the super bowl they have

[20205.50s -> 20209.26s]  drag him down to the ground and he makes it out four people just acted like idiots

[20332.60s -> 20342.10s]  beat the super bowl on stream not yet it's not even the end of the first quarter and
[20342.10s -> 20350.60s]  it's already this many interesting okay first and 30 ball at the 30 yard line f f

[20388.04s -> 20416.49s]  third down sack sack sack and that's the qb see you now that should solidify a win i think
[20424.02s -> 20427.46s]  see speaking of see i think vinnie started his stream
[20429.86s -> 20432.66s]  right after that one oh fuck i gotta get this i gotta get this punk

[20599.29s -> 20622.33s]  minute unleash here let's go with uh prevention defense sounds pretty good sack kill other
[20622.33s -> 20636.65s]  photograph who got it me or him that was their star player right oh we both activated the
[20637.77s -> 20638.65s]  unleash at the same time
[20645.26s -> 20658.58s]  ah third down is a run it's gonna be a pass it's the opposite of what they say every time
[20659.54s -> 20673.56s]  fourth down they're probably gonna go for it bring back mad bring fourth and
[20673.56s -> 20686.14s]  ten leave what do you think they're gonna go for it no they're not i got one chance here
[20686.14s -> 20691.58s]  here
[20698.44s -> 20715.96s]  21 seven going good so far i'll get out i'll bring them back i'll bring them back behind your
[20715.96s -> 20728.62s]  blockers that's how you take care of that oh why is mims so slow oh no please tell me that
[20728.62s -> 20749.19s]  wasn't his knee knee they all just don't talk to me here let's go with oh we got a guy open
[20749.19s -> 20762.14s]  there excuse me oh excuse me nobody can stop me first down close to a first down no first down
[20762.94s -> 20777.61s]  really franchise brings the dinner bell again what can you say this guy's a winner that's
[20777.61s -> 20781.53s]  what they pay the big bucks players that are lucky these days heck when i used to play
[20781.53s -> 20785.85s]  twenty seven nickels around like manhole covers and if they if they really got managing they
[20785.85s -> 20789.45s]  throw manhole covers around like they were throwing man we are going to the real super
[20789.45s -> 20795.78s]  bowl in this game if i can actually just solidify this it don't matter what happens next
[20796.98s -> 20810.55s]  what is madden doing back by popular demand it brought him back it was almost a riot in here
[20825.29s -> 20828.33s]  let's just make it a guaranteed play that works every time
[20828.89s -> 20858.15s]  oh i did a little too early it was a guaranteed play it is messed up across right now still in
[20858.15s -> 20867.34s]  third quarter the offense looking at first and 30 ball at the 27 yard line wrong guy
[20868.22s -> 20883.64s]  they're all on the same team it means they're all the enemy straight in
[20887.27s -> 20890.95s]  las vegas has been dominant against the run so far i know i wouldn't want
[20890.95s -> 20896.41s]  to be out there carrying that ball today are there rugby games that are like this
[20898.10s -> 20905.38s]  um i don't think so i think i've only ever heard of one rugby game and wasn't like an
[20905.38s -> 20914.06s]  indie game i don't remember one releasing maybe they did he's going long incomplete
[20914.06s -> 20917.82s]  the quarterback needs to make sure his throw gets there before the defender i think
[20917.82s -> 20924.30s]  what them they uh field go another going for it oops well keep that one guy back there
[20930.25s -> 20933.45s]  guys guys good thing you're back here
[20946.09s -> 20951.14s]  as we reach the end of the third quarter las vegas leads by 27
[20954.01s -> 20959.21s]  i can't believe that check time like the quarterback just walked through the whole team
[20959.21s -> 20961.77s]  here we go again
[20968.26s -> 20990.20s]  let me see that again hit the ground it actually bounced off the ground
[20991.61s -> 20995.37s]  i'm just angry field goal blocking right now it's not what i should be doing but i'm gonna do
[20995.37s -> 21008.70s]  it anyway when you're behind and turn the ball over like that it doesn't do much for
[21008.70s -> 21012.62s]  your team's mental state get it out of here first down and 30
[21012.62s -> 21023.69s]  be right through the covers there's back there he was gently placing an egg inside
[21023.69s -> 21028.41s]  a silk stock that's something my high school coach used to say i can get one more
[21030.97s -> 21033.61s]  this was almost a game
[21039.94s -> 21045.16s]  no it depends and it's intercepted again you did bounce on the ground
[21048.63s -> 21053.03s]  how are you scooping these up so well 30 yards to go ball with the 49 yard line
[21053.99s -> 21071.21s]  las vegas has the football this game is fucking wacky who cares throw to the end zone
[21090.78s -> 21102.55s]  it worked yeah let's try to
[21108.68s -> 21116.10s]  let's rub it in now it's a good number well i was scared of new england for some reason
[21116.98s -> 21123.13s]  i got destroyed by new york you can still lose this no it's not physically possible to lose
[21123.13s -> 21148.84s]  this three i cannot lose this even thing on side picker cover they're a good team well
[21149.72s -> 21153.32s]  just look their stats were great and they're one of the division one leaders
[21154.12s -> 21157.58s]  i'm just going by what i see
[21168.60s -> 21172.28s]  he's got to be at the top two or 300 players have ever seen
[21173.40s -> 21179.80s]  at least that i can remember 350 top 300 players and he's knocked down
[21182.97s -> 21196.26s]  that one was funny this offensive series now we rub it in guys imagine that this is
[21196.26s -> 21200.10s]  the super bowl that you just saw wouldn't you just loved if you just like do this to new england
[21200.10s -> 21215.77s]  be like fuck you like fuck you loser more bully more bully fine a little bit more that's
[21215.77s -> 21240.86s]  all we need all right we got it off the mark oh first and 30 that's what happened if i got
[21240.86s -> 21252.09s]  up there i probably could do a better job than that actually no i want more time out time out
[21252.09s -> 21270.74s]  las vegas as the clock runs out las vegas is your winner here tonight defeat the new england
[21270.74s -> 21281.21s]  regulators in campaign mode did i bet on this one it's a lot of clash moves damn
[21286.81s -> 21301.99s]  all right devastator pads new sponsor here comes the final game of the season i believe
[21302.71s -> 21309.34s]  yeah i already already gonna be in the championship french i love you i told you i loved you recently
[21309.34s -> 21313.98s]  grace just dumped her old agent and signed with yours truly whatever you're doing
[21313.98s -> 21321.77s]  to make her happy keep doing it there's quentin so listen up i may have a way for us to get
[21321.77s -> 21326.09s]  back at the commission can't talk about it now but i'll check back with you later
[21328.01s -> 21331.13s]  looks like all the pain and suffering you've been dishing out is paying off
[21331.13s -> 21334.73s]  i've got pro for max on the other line and they want you to be the sponsor of their new
[21334.73s -> 21339.85s]  devastator line of pads i hear you can bust a hole in a cinder block wall with these things
[21342.34s -> 21354.28s]  really let's see that's pretty good so what are we putting the final point in i think
[21356.78s -> 21364.65s]  i've got enough for one more agility strength break tackle or tackle oh
[21370.07s -> 21382.28s]  um drugs break tackle break tackle i might have enough for one more after this last game
[21383.08s -> 21396.31s]  versus the vancouver beavers i'm not going to spend any money we're good do every drug no
[21396.31s -> 21406.52s]  no no no no drugs at all because then the championship game i can take all of them
[21406.52s -> 21417.08s]  so i've already solidified the championship game five and one when vancouver enters the
[21417.08s -> 21422.76s]  league a couple years back everyone laughs at the name beaver thanks to a solid defense and
[21422.76s -> 21429.08s]  the steady rhythm of tight end carlos cotto nobody's laughing now the guy can kill him
[21429.08s -> 21434.78s]  he's the funniest trash talker in the league let this guy get rolling or he will beat you
[21434.78s -> 21445.38s]  down so here's the plan i doesn't matter this game doesn't matter i'm going to
[21447.19s -> 21455.24s]  just play like an asshole i'm not going to get anybody hurt none of my teammates are
[21455.24s -> 21461.82s]  going to get hurt they all should be back i'm gonna throw the game i don't care if we lose
[21462.46s -> 21471.82s]  because i'm already in the super bowl winning does yes winning does get you more money
[21472.70s -> 21479.00s]  good evening everyone that's your right snow why would the what would the cheerleader is
[21479.00s -> 21503.94s]  running onto the field for snowy vancouver it's all right if you lose solomon you won't
[21503.94s -> 21506.42s]  happen for the final game that's why i'm not going to even do one play
[21507.38s -> 21524.41s]  so solomon is not going to get the ball once it actually did snow in vancouver
[21527.48s -> 21531.88s]  the captain comes through for this team once again plays like he's running over and over
[21531.88s -> 21542.86s]  again at this point which is too bad that's not a bad idea anybody ever questions this
[21542.86s -> 21547.98s]  guy's leadership may can just look to a play like that fifth play of the drive
[21552.02s -> 21558.79s]  franchise gives the fans exactly what they came to see right there each of those
[21559.03s -> 21562.15s]  for the other team will admit that this guy brings excitement to the game
[21562.15s -> 21564.63s]  they're in the red zone now time to capitalize
[21567.11s -> 21580.52s]  full line touchdown let's just do that every single play why even play the game normally
[21584.06s -> 21587.58s]  six hours in you're gonna spam the same because i i don't i don't have to worry about it
[21588.14s -> 21604.17s]  let's do it again version is good i found the meta this is a really lame game to watch
[21604.73s -> 21622.02s]  it's almost very good imagine that worked i got a rupture his spleen if i'm not careful i'll get my
[21622.02s -> 21628.44s]  own spleen rupture that would be bad super bowl might get a fractured skull
[21635.88s -> 21639.56s]  now i'm not gonna get a career ending injury i just need to be above by more than five to
[21639.56s -> 21664.81s]  ten points it's all that matters third down third and 13 turn it over that kind of froze
[21664.81s -> 21670.42s]  up there in the middle this is a big fourth down coming up it comes upon field goal you're
[21670.42s -> 21680.82s]  not gonna get it look at that wind and it's good that's stuck on own teammates yeah somehow
[21681.46s -> 21697.74s]  it's all good really i thought i had to usually that's slow most different
[21697.74s -> 21711.56s]  i can just stuff into people uh-oh who is that sorry they don't matter
[21713.18s -> 21722.06s]  82 28 is the one that matters las vegas leads by five so if your main dude gets badly injured
[21722.06s -> 21727.94s]  is it legit just game over uh it is your save file does not get deleted
[21728.98s -> 21737.67s]  but you have to go back to your last save what okay what will you what the hell are you
[21737.67s -> 21745.05s]  doing so no Sullivan doesn't i don't want Sullivan to have a ball that was freaking
[21745.05s -> 21751.86s]  me out what the hell are you doing like their chances here on third and short i mean
[21751.86s -> 21765.67s]  you're that's how you do it with the first x was touchdown you don't know a series of downs here
[21767.67s -> 21777.16s]  prison all over again block in practice why should he make it in the game
[21778.04s -> 21793.11s]  second to goal the whole team is here that was unbelievable she's at least six people
[21805.96s -> 21827.24s]  very good i can unleash someone if i can strip it i hate this
[21833.74s -> 21840.97s]  qb sneak into the right episode here comes an injury on the collarbone
[21858.70s -> 21865.34s]  wow i'm surprised i didn't get that back with under 30 seconds to play in the first half
[21865.34s -> 21875.03s]  las vegas leads by 13 what down i'll take that ball back
[21875.83s -> 21895.11s]  oh he breaks his fucking collarbone kick it kick do it again give me that ball he's going for
[21899.93s -> 21900.97s]  oh fuck
[21905.61s -> 21910.49s]  Vancouver saw something in the defense and jumped on it a big game sets them up in nice
[21910.49s -> 21918.34s]  field position and so at halftime leads by 13 and i can't wait for the championship game
[21918.34s -> 21931.51s]  i'm gonna be so amped up for it and i'm gonna let up either even if i'm up by like 60 points
[21931.51s -> 21950.90s]  i'm still gonna play as hard as i can just can't string anything together they keep going for the
[21950.90s -> 21955.54s]  same run don't you know i am the only one that can do that maybe if you did your quarterback
[21955.54s -> 21965.53s]  to do the same like diaper run to the right it's not it's not gonna happen i'm sorry it's
[21965.53s -> 21974.62s]  not going to
[21978.33s -> 21986.55s]  somebody get him good fourth and 31 is it a field goal
[21987.51s -> 22005.45s]  no they have to punt it yeah turn off good field position too for some reason i thought
[22005.45s -> 22010.09s]  he's gonna die i was gonna try to jump over him first down and 30
[22018.78s -> 22021.50s]  fundamentals just keep the clock going they got an unleash not yet
[22022.30s -> 22027.02s]  24 second down and quite a ways to go fucking i'm going to the right check this
[22028.38s -> 22036.92s]  he just left the right wide open vancouver just looks weak against them that means the
[22036.92s -> 22045.88s]  offense is at their leisure to chew up yards and the clock first and goal it's gut check time
[22045.88s -> 22056.38s]  ball at the 20 yard line he's hit and dropped the quarterback received absolutely no mercy he
[22056.38s -> 22067.58s]  was taken down hard yeah right back to him it's okay you hate to see a hit like that
[22067.58s -> 22077.26s]  that sort of thing sure don't just let the time run up and so with three quarters gone
[22077.26s -> 22084.57s]  las vegas this quarterback doesn't understand the pocket no i don't you're right third down
[22084.73s -> 22085.37s]  i really don't
[22098.84s -> 22101.00s]  i can't have 23 points i don't like that number
[22116.66s -> 22134.34s]  i'm not having the devil's number it's bad luck i'll get it back right now still how long do
[22134.34s -> 22153.35s]  it though so all right last quarter that's intercepted that turnover just adds to this
[22153.35s -> 22157.35s]  team's long list 100 guaranteed i don't see how they're going to turn it around at this point
[22159.35s -> 22162.87s]  big series of downs upcoming ball of the 17 yard line
[22164.23s -> 22177.66s]  sir this game doesn't matter such an amazing game the next one sure does
[22182.63s -> 22192.09s]  zone and he makes the crap what what did i even end up fuck it whatever guaranteed win writer
[22192.97s -> 22202.22s]  three two franchise adds six more to his personal total
[22206.33s -> 22221.42s]  he's going the wrong way 28's good get 30 that's two points
[22222.38s -> 22242.46s]  so now it's just a question of building up some tackles for more money like this
[22243.58s -> 22251.58s]  i'm gonna throw the game i know i did say that
[22258.58s -> 22263.62s]  oh going all out blitz 30 yards to go try to murder the quarterback that sounds like a
[22263.62s -> 22274.01s]  plan what um that's not he's not done apparently somehow he's dead
[22283.66s -> 22289.38s]  covers it up that was really dumb
[22292.55s -> 22308.36s]  fucking tom and jerry that shit is good it's all right on side kick the don't even forget
[22314.65s -> 22321.70s]  that was brutal but i still got it first and 30 ball at the 40 yard mark
[22322.42s -> 22339.69s]  he fell all right let's run what he's gonna gently run the ball don't get hurt
[22341.45s -> 22345.26s]  he has no more time on every question everyone's gonna think i'm an
[22345.26s -> 22380.34s]  asshole for this you're gonna think i'm fucking crazy oops game over he takes it inside
[22384.49s -> 22385.13s]  i win
[22388.57s -> 22395.45s]  oh thank god by my mercy he laid him out and as time expires los vegas wins the game
[22397.06s -> 22405.27s]  oh thanks like a shattered wrist again i would fucking be so mad okay onto the super bowl
[22411.13s -> 22420.23s]  imagine seeing that in a real game that's an absolute fine from the nfl right that's like a
[22420.23s -> 22434.39s]  $100,000 fine at least all right we are at the end game here delaying the game i think
[22434.39s -> 22439.69s]  would be unsportsmanlike conduct no i was talking to miller about that yesterday the
[22439.69s -> 22458.71s]  bearcats can't trade up they don't have cap room excuse me what the hell are you doing
[22458.71s -> 22464.94s]  here i got some information you're going to want to make it quick first i want a new deal

[22790.92s -> 22798.94s]  apparently that's what his head looks like and that was one of the best players that's
[22799.02s -> 22817.58s]  happen back that's gonna set him back a long ways third and goal we're gonna do
[22830.46s -> 22834.54s]  fourth and goal they're only gonna get three points if they even get it that's how you play
[22834.54s -> 22844.47s]  defense and fucking goddamn super bowl what have you got line up like everybody over here
[22845.75s -> 22859.99s]  almost what and it's good why don't they just do that just put all like 10 players on the

[22901.30s -> 22910.26s]  this make it happen come on get across that plane get across that plane that's the Sullivan
[22910.90s -> 22918.31s]  that's why you said hey he's not so if you both tripped on a crack on the sidewalk you kind of
[22918.31s -> 22921.99s]  fall forward at the same speed i mean you're still still in the game after the first play
[22927.93s -> 22938.09s]  still do it again get the ball to Sullivan easy run across go across the plane oh it's
[22938.09s -> 22943.45s]  okay and that's the end of the first quarter as las vegas leads by four is he going to
[22943.45s -> 22950.76s]  complete the game tonight you're looking at it right now this is the super bowl vegas versus
[22950.76s -> 22971.59s]  la why is everybody laughing why is everybody laughing what happened get in there Sullivan
[22981.75s -> 22992.34s]  75 points i told you that's the real super bowl i've beaten the riot like three or four times
[22992.34s -> 23014.12s]  in a row they don't scare me at all injury we get spongebob at the halftime show
[23015.90s -> 23023.58s]  yeah i'll have spongebob start his act and then i'll delete the screen he'll be on screen for
[23023.58s -> 23042.33s]  like three seconds check this out that's not a fumble somehow just like in the real super
[23042.33s -> 23060.33s]  ball that's right um second and 11 i'm gonna stay back there it is las vegas makes the
[23060.33s -> 23068.22s]  recovery i didn't get a point come on give me a point we're getting something different
[23068.86s -> 23073.58s]  for these sorts of moments all that living in the shadow of the offense is worth it when you can
[23073.58s -> 23087.48s]  score oh he should be careful no excuse mark the league might find him it's only the second
[23087.48s -> 23093.80s]  quarter there's still potential oops oops how many times have i went oops and the extra
[23093.80s -> 23121.86s]  point is oops oops keep thinking those are fumbles you aren't on pace to hit 75 this game
[23121.94s -> 23124.92s]  is not really
[23127.56s -> 23132.25s]  i'll say that now of course it certainly doesn't help when he's but here we go
[23134.12s -> 23138.36s]  you know what what you gotta do you know is when life hands you lemon what you gotta do
[23138.36s -> 23148.06s]  is not squirt it oh what do you say when life gives you lemons do what
[23160.12s -> 23166.38s]  which is funny because the dog i just thought they should have named him fluffy
[23166.38s -> 23172.04s]  don't squaw don't squirt it uh looking like i'm gonna win the super bowl here
[23173.59s -> 23175.67s]  this is gonna turn into a blowout i think
[23186.20s -> 23191.00s]  and the extra point is good what is this guy's name have they even said his name
[23196.97s -> 23199.37s]  they don't refer to him as anything it's just other guy
[23199.37s -> 23221.62s]  they're pretty far back though john madden
[23230.47s -> 23238.76s]  i'm not gonna lie i just switched character and hit dive over and over again no bm what am i
[23238.76s -> 23247.37s]  doing just make it happen no bm this is a big fourth down coming up why are they using the
[23247.37s -> 23255.16s]  timeout no timeout this is a super bowl how do you make that mistake so at halftime las vegas
[23255.16s -> 23309.93s]  leads by 25 that's it you know these guys may seem tough but they're softies i heard that
[23309.93s -> 23315.29s]  one of these guys are not gonna say but but he offered a ride home to a young woman walking
[23315.29s -> 23319.53s]  through dangerous part of town just last night today he ended up giving her a ride and all he
[23319.53s -> 23328.74s]  said was honestly that's right there you're still better than the actual super bowl one
[23336.66s -> 23344.58s]  that was that's what they did at the super bowl just really screaming this
[23344.58s -> 23349.32s]  simply cannot get there running it looks like their coach is determined to keep trying
[23349.32s -> 23353.32s]  and i'll play it for real okay fine i'm gonna you know fucking play it during the game
[23354.20s -> 23358.33s]  no i don't want it on the halftime show i wanted to be playing while i'm
[23358.41s -> 23370.84s]  trying to win the game i don't know why they didn't do what he's thinking in the middle of
[23371.48s -> 23393.48s]  turn this shit off it's gonna match
[23405.53s -> 23471.91s]  oh and there it is it's auto play here we go here we go
[23478.49s -> 23482.49s]  and that puts it away that's game over who gives a shit i'm gonna throw the ball in
[23482.49s -> 23496.89s]  the end zone every play i'm gonna be the most hated team in the league free and the conversion
[23496.89s -> 23508.60s]  is good punt every possession okay no that sucks that all right no actually i'm yeah sure
[23509.40s -> 23533.05s]  go for 75 i'm gonna blitz every play 30 75 to three you know i'll try i can still get that
[23533.77s -> 23550.14s]  damn it worth a shot field goal block every play you know i'll give you a little story
[23551.59s -> 23558.66s]  back when madden was really really popular uh my brother used to want to play against me all
[23558.66s -> 23562.50s]  the time he's a huge fan i didn't know what the hell was going on i was probably like 12
[23563.30s -> 23567.62s]  so my older brother was a big fan of madden and he would always want to play with me
[23567.62s -> 23571.62s]  because who else are you gonna play with he would have some friends over sometimes but
[23571.62s -> 23576.90s]  anyways so i had no idea what the fuck i was doing red zone offense here so i just did field
[23576.90s -> 23582.10s]  goal block every play and i'm not kidding he would he would just do pass plays and
[23582.66s -> 23587.46s]  cool runs and stuff like that and it would end up being like 120
[23590.42s -> 23598.26s]  because i didn't know what the fuck was going on oh yes uh it would be over
[23598.26s -> 23604.02s]  a hundred something points each game i'm like having these flashbacks right now
[23607.86s -> 23611.22s]  i would do hail mary's every play and he would just intercept them because he knew how to
[23611.22s -> 23618.73s]  control the game and catch doing a manual catch field goal blocks and hail mary's
[23621.34s -> 23633.78s]  oh this is yeah this is embarrassing at this point it's embarrassing oops this is embarrassing
[23633.78s -> 23641.64s]  for them it's this is embarrassing oops the stream first down and 30 ball at the 33 yard line
[23642.28s -> 23676.65s]  i can't stop it did i catch it i got it into the end zone make sure all right it's worth that
[23676.65s -> 23690.55s]  all right let's go all right you know all right oops jukes touchdown franchise with six more
[23690.55s -> 23694.95s]  points do i know why athletes get paid so much money look no further than that play right there
[23694.95s -> 23698.31s]  i'm sure he's not pulling people out of a burning building or teaching a young
[23698.31s -> 23702.87s]  what's your name but this guy plays the game very very well and that's worth tens of millions
[23702.87s -> 23735.54s]  of dollars in my book i win i love how we have devolved to just me not giving shit
[23741.75s -> 23751.08s]  i just got home alone like i'm up by so much i've trained my team so well there was a
[23751.08s -> 23753.96s]  challenge here in the first few games of division but now it doesn't even matter
[23755.21s -> 23763.45s]  oh good for you you got 15 points
[23777.45s -> 23800.66s]  it fucking destroyed 75 points now it's not possible anymore first down 30 yards to go
[23803.22s -> 23808.57s]  looking for the big play he's got it i mean maybe it is
[23809.37s -> 23823.26s]  oh and touchdown i might get i might get 50 or 60 maybe not 70 it's false with me to get 60
[23823.82s -> 23839.66s]  and that's two points just jumped backwards use those timeouts i'm gonna go for it i'll try
[23841.26s -> 23856.41s]  on sidekick come on give me to 60 first and 30 ball at the 36 yard line
[23858.18s -> 23870.34s]  it keeps it deep and it's possible it's possible first down and 30
[23874.41s -> 23882.63s]  oh almost oh dick it's not possible anymore i got to whatever on sidekick
[23882.63s -> 23884.63s]  i don't care just boot it into the fucking crowd
[23890.44s -> 23919.06s]  you had time you had time it's okay another interception turn it into a score
[23920.02s -> 23925.78s]  it's about time to uncork the champagne that defensive here it comes about clinches it
[23925.78s -> 23932.28s]  well we can do it let me just do something real quick here i need to get one completion
[23932.28s -> 23942.41s]  and i can get into the end zone guaranteed pass that's perfect no i didn't okay i got okay
[23942.41s -> 23946.17s]  okay okay okay hold on hold on oh no please tell me that
[23951.27s -> 23960.60s]  the chives has just crossed the 100 yard rushing threshold for the try just to get a point
[23964.74s -> 23987.59s]  the offense looking at first and 30 that's not a point just give me a point he's fine
[23995.40s -> 24007.14s]  not even gonna see the end of the game all right here comes 80 points i fucking laugh
[24007.86s -> 24008.10s]  oh

[24038.87s -> 24053.70s]  60 in the super bowl this would be the worst super bowl ever
[24054.58s -> 24060.22s]  anywhere i went and as time expires i didn't get dirty hit by bruno
[24060.22s -> 24065.18s]  through the competition unscathed that is the super league crown division champs finish

[24467.72s -> 24481.32s]  two let me just take a look and see if there's any bonus stuff there are a few bonus modes
[24481.32s -> 24485.48s]  butterfingers it's total chaos on the field with every tackle leading into a fumble
[24488.26s -> 24494.30s]  you get the ball back after every score every play that goes by without a score decreases
[24494.30s -> 24500.66s]  the points from a touchdown by one dirty hits unleashed hits and injuries all add points to
[24500.66s -> 24506.22s]  your score that's pretty cool the helmets are off and the hits are twice as painful leading
[24506.22s -> 24512.06s]  to tons of injuries this prison ball no kickoff no first downs in a shortened field
[24512.94s -> 24527.94s]  uh let's take the helmets off and just fucking around it doesn't really matter i'll be the
[24527.94s -> 24539.48s]  i'll be the regular vegas team i'm just doing it for fun anyways welcome to the league so nobody
[24539.48s -> 24554.20s]  has a helmet so this is kind of this is prison ball without being a prison do the
[24554.20s -> 24559.24s]  astex have perfect stats i think they are one of the only teams that have uh perfect
[24559.24s -> 24565.27s]  stats and maybe not perfect but good enough where it looks like that i think there was
[24565.27s -> 24579.37s]  like one of the team that was like that good evening ever no helmets our first injury the game
[24579.37s -> 24614.34s]  turns off make it count first down and 30 oh well thanks for coming to the stream
[24618.02s -> 24626.30s]  that's gonna that's where i'm gonna call it play mutant football league maybe eventually
[24626.86s -> 24632.97s]  but that was blitz league 2 uh if you weren't here earlier i have an unfortunate thing to

[24804.98s -> 24814.01s]  happen so this is more shitty and more complicated rugby american football is kind of like rugby
[24815.19s -> 24825.61s]  except they wear helmets and there's a lot less kicking the ball that happens a lot in rugby
[24825.61s -> 24834.94s]  doesn't it question on taxes do i have to do anything specific to explain randomly getting
[24834.94s -> 24840.63s]  like two thousand dollars it's all income that's all i have to claim it all on top of that
[24840.63s -> 24849.42s]  moving across the country is i think i have to file separate returns and my taxes it's not as
[24849.42s -> 24855.90s]  simple as just opening up turbo tax and being like okay this this this this like expenses
[24855.90s -> 24862.95s]  and because it's all 1099 i don't have like a w2 so it's always like a full two-day process
[24862.95s -> 24875.75s]  to get it all done so taxes for boston and taxes for vegas yeah because i moved

[25385.80s -> 25391.58s]  meaning every planet except for pluto will be vaporized but we won't even be alive to see
[25391.58s -> 25401.69s]  that because in two million years mercury will crash into earth i'm scared uh i don't think
[25401.69s -> 25408.98s]  we're gonna last two million years i would be surprised if we made it like another fucking 30
[25409.62s -> 25416.63s]  you know what i mean i'd be surprised if we made it like another fucking 200 years
[25424.71s -> 25433.40s]  don't you watch star trek we'll be fine that's nile that's a nihilist
[25433.40s -> 25438.73s]  no i'm just saying like two million years we don't even know what happened to the
[25438.81s -> 25447.80s]  fucking mayans how they were around for a long time the dinosaurs gone they were around for
[25447.80s -> 25462.41s]  what like fucking million years two million years is a long time what killed the dinosaurs
[25462.41s -> 25470.89s]  i don't know probably some kind of fucking fluid that they were inhaling that would be my guess
[25487.26s -> 25495.94s]  it's water yeah the ice age the whole planet got real cold okay but if that was possible
[25497.78s -> 25503.38s]  oh you know uh well the dinosaurs were around and then the whole earth turned into an ice cube
[25503.38s -> 25509.59s]  for a million years you don't think that could happen again you don't think we'd go into like
[25509.59s -> 25525.26s]  a a dark souls fucking light the flame scenario that's possible who knows in 500 years we've got
[25525.26s -> 25531.46s]  all kinds of potential global warming crises the dinosaurs might come back they're probably
[25531.46s -> 25536.17s]  still buried that you know we how far can we dig into the earth global warming is going
[25536.17s -> 25543.74s]  to make the dinosaurs that were buried in ice 500 meters below the earth's surface it's going
[25543.74s -> 25547.10s]  to melt those ice cubes you ever see you ever see jurassic park with the mosquitoes in the ice
[25547.10s -> 25552.06s]  cube imagine 50 fucking trillion super mosquitoes all melting because of global goddamn warming
[25552.70s -> 25562.39s]  and they're all going to come up and suck all your blood you know how cold it is in the
[25562.39s -> 25573.48s]  center of the earth it's like 12 celsius no like negative five celsius they tell you it's
[25574.44s -> 25581.67s]  bullshit no no no no there's not it's not hot in there the whole earth is just a giant ice cube
[25581.67s -> 25615.66s]  that's gonna melt that's why wine are in cellars yet somebody gets it that's why
[25615.66s -> 25619.66s]  when it's 90 degrees outside and you go down the lower level in your house go in your
[25619.66s -> 25623.74s]  basement it's much cooler down there you're gonna get closer to the earth's center ice cube

[25707.11s -> 25711.91s]  that it's kind of insane to see that number is that enough for you to play god hand
[25712.47s -> 25716.87s]  no all right i'm ending that joke right now until i hear you say i'm going to play god hand
[25717.83s -> 25725.38s]  oh okay thanks jermal i still have the playstation 2 but god hand was digital

[25731.96s -> 25739.24s]  there's no digital store for ps2 how did i play that game is it was that ps3 like psn store
[25739.24s -> 25756.34s]  i don't remember how i even got it it's on the p okay it's on the ps3 store ps no well
[25756.34s -> 25760.42s]  i can't tell you i'm never gonna play it ever again but i am gonna tell you don't expect
[25763.59s -> 25774.18s]  watch me turn it on next stream but thank you snooze and copter thank you so much thank you
[25774.18s -> 25781.16s]  nile arian for the one dollar so this is basically the xfl it is kind of the xfl except
[25782.36s -> 25786.97s]  people are people get very hurt in this game you'd hope that they wouldn't
[25786.97s -> 25792.20s]  in real life right but thank you thank you lazy look for the one dollar will you change
[25792.20s -> 25797.80s]  your bits threshold in your settings to 300 so that we can't donate bits that won't be
[25797.80s -> 25804.04s]  red new people could be disappointed if their bits aren't red no because then that means that
[25804.04s -> 25812.52s]  nobody can ever give any anything below three dollars and at the end of the day bits are
[25812.52s -> 25817.10s]  another form of support right whether you subscribe to the channel or if you give
[25817.10s -> 25821.18s]  bits of 15 cents 20 cents i see people they give it all the time people give it all the
[25821.18s -> 25826.63s]  time so i wouldn't want to make it impossible for someone to give me less than three
[25826.63s -> 25835.72s]  dollars because i don't want the threshold because then at that that at that point
[25835.72s -> 25840.12s]  instead of just reading you're not allowed to give me money unless it's three bucks
[25841.27s -> 25848.01s]  which the purpose of you know all these you know subs and bits in the first place are for
[25848.01s -> 25874.22s]  someone to want to support the channel 50 tall and minimum incoming no yeah that was a
[25874.22s -> 25876.54s]  lot of back and forth with trying to figure out how that was going to happen
[25877.26s -> 25885.91s]  but they had to be something had something had to be done because as we all know some of these
[25885.91s -> 25892.52s]  end of the stream sometimes there's hundreds of messages hundreds of donations that the
[25892.52s -> 25896.84s]  stream can go on after the stream is technically over and we sit here for like another hour or
[25896.84s -> 25901.66s]  two hours or whatever it's going to get to a point where it's just not feasible to sit here
[25901.66s -> 25908.34s]  for like four or five hours plus and i'd like to get in front of it rather than try to
[25908.42s -> 25924.63s]  catch up to it potentially later just talk like an auctioneer well that's another thing i've seen
[25924.63s -> 25929.18s]  people talk about well why don't you just hurry up then and read them i mean that's not the
[25929.18s -> 25934.02s]  point of why i want to do this it would be really easy for me to go like this hey lazy
[25934.02s -> 25937.54s]  luke thanks for the one dollar uh change your bitch to 300 now thanks man hey nile lawyer
[25937.54s -> 25940.82s]  and thanks for the one dollar uh dig up robbie so he can run into it when uh thanks a lot
[25940.82s -> 25944.34s]  man thanks a lot nile for the one dollar uh dig up mim so he can run the field now thanks
[25944.34s -> 25951.83s]  a man i don't want to do that i mean at that point i'm just at that point i'm just reading them
[25951.83s -> 25958.57s]  because they're here instead of giving attention to as many of them as i can and talk about things
[25958.57s -> 25963.13s]  and hang out and it's more fun that way for me i don't just want to have it be a thing
[25963.13s -> 25973.86s]  that i'm just phoning in and reading just because they're here so i like to give each
[25973.86s -> 25978.34s]  message at least some attention and yeah some of the jokey ones that people give and
[25979.14s -> 25981.94s]  they'll say something ridiculous and i'll just be like all right and i'll kind of just
[25981.94s -> 25995.08s]  keep going but for the most part i like to give each one like a full my full attention show
[25995.08s -> 26011.03s]  feet really that's your that's the response from the one guy there anyways uh that's gonna
[26011.03s -> 26016.42s]  change probably in like a week some point in the middle of february i wanted to give enough
[26016.42s -> 26021.54s]  people time to know that it was gonna happen and like last time it's still gonna be a
[26021.54s -> 26025.46s]  process to for people to understand that that's happening but i wanted to give at
[26025.46s -> 26030.68s]  least a couple weeks two or three weeks for people to figure it out right but thank you
[26030.68s -> 26037.27s]  lazy luke and hey thanks nile aureon for the two dollars here they did say dig up robbie so he
[26037.27s -> 26041.59s]  can run it in one last time and dig up mims so he can run the field one last time
[26042.79s -> 26053.42s]  mims was on the field mims was on the field we got rid of robbie because robbie got his
[26053.42s -> 26060.17s]  leg spine broken and we replaced him with another guy who got injured every other game
[26060.17s -> 26068.63s]  but was the best player in the league so you know that's just the way it is a hunter force
[26068.63s -> 26074.12s]  thanks for the one dollar the hidden details the nfl doesn't want you to know about

[26228.15s -> 26236.20s]  shutting down uh all the posts you've ever had on google plus will be gone uh stop by google
[26236.20s -> 26244.44s]  plus and see the end um the only reason why i had google plus in the first place is because
[26244.44s -> 26251.50s]  it was forced on me by youtube i had to connect my account to google plus and it just sat
[26251.50s -> 26262.86s]  there rotting i don't think i ever used it i remember they that was so desperate what the
[26262.86s -> 26272.06s]  hell were they thinking attaching every youtube account had to parasite into their body into
[26272.06s -> 26283.64s]  their channel google plus it was a requirement what were they thinking i don't know and now
[26283.64s -> 26295.56s]  the thing is shutting down that's kind of unbelievable but if you do use it sorry that
[26295.56s -> 26299.90s]  it's going down i think there are a lot of other places that are probably better at this

[26572.33s -> 26579.37s]  have a great time and i i think it'd be very counterproductive if i was like actively trying

[27003.46s -> 27007.30s]  minimums i wanted to put this in before the minimum was raised could you make the minimum
[27007.30s -> 27012.26s]  250 instead of three buying in multiples of five is easier than buying in multiples of three and
[27012.26s -> 27017.42s]  it would keep from awkward buying two different sets of bits also please play pirate at some

[27033.64s -> 27040.23s]  honest with you the reason why i picked three is because that's like what that's what a lot
[27040.23s -> 27049.10s]  of people have aren't a lot of most streams have like three 350 for a minimum that's just kind of
[27049.10s -> 27055.42s]  the way i just was like i guess that's what people do right is there a reason why that is
[27056.06s -> 27083.32s]  people do 420 250 the reason is three is between one and five let me let me look
[27083.32s -> 27098.86s]  into this because that that's not i'm i'm open to suggestions for sure set the minimum
[27099.18s -> 27114.07s]  i come back you know i'm gonna make a 10 i was thinking 25 because you guys said yeah two and

[27358.17s -> 27365.13s]  any system of beliefs as to why i'm doing this there's only it's a biological reason
[27365.77s -> 27373.13s]  it's because when i sit down and i'm just hanging out i just sweat i just perspire
[27373.13s -> 27377.77s]  and there's nothing i can do about it it's not unhealthy it's it's not a bad thing i've actually
[27377.77s -> 27384.98s]  talked to doctors about it's like yeah you're a little sweaty only in certain places and i just
[27384.98s -> 27388.26s]  if i sit here with a shirt on if i take a shower and then come and sit down here and i'm
[27388.26s -> 27393.48s]  just sitting here i would just sweat through that shirt so i said you know what fucking
[27393.48s -> 27407.02s]  whatever why would i do that i've told this story a bunch of times but i can put on a
[27407.02s -> 27415.86s]  pair of sneakers get on some like tech gear i could in jeans i could in a pair of jeans
[27415.86s -> 27425.06s]  and a sweater run five miles and one drop of sweat will not come out of my body it's sitting
[27425.06s -> 27434.38s]  here in a seat sweat just comes out of my arms i don't know why i wish i knew how are

[27469.54s -> 27473.94s]  that last donation was a typo big wow i was going to ask if the night sky shirt will ever be
[27473.94s -> 27486.86s]  shipping in women's uh much love um i i don't know because there's i put the the women's cup
[27486.86s -> 27493.21s]  of the glue man shirt because it was available for so long and the other they're all unisex
[27493.21s -> 27497.82s]  shirts but i kind of i don't know i kind of didn't want to like overwhelm everybody
[27502.01s -> 27505.29s]  with like four pieces of merchandise so i was like oh the glue man shirt was available
[27505.29s -> 27509.77s]  before but it wasn't available in a women's cut so i'll put a women's cup for the glue man shirt
[27509.77s -> 27515.21s]  and then this shirt is just a unisex shirt kind of like i did last time and then i'm sure i
[27515.21s -> 27532.12s]  probably will but it that's not a hard thing to do make a hat i actually can make hats
[27534.57s -> 27539.30s]  i have a lot of options but i don't want to overwhelm people with new merchandise
[27540.02s -> 27545.72s]  it's like oh i got two new i got the shirts are back like one week later and there's phone
[27545.72s -> 27552.47s]  cases and socks and stickers and hats i'd like to wait a little bit for this particular
