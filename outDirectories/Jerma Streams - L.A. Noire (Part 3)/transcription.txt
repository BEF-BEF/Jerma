[6.46s -> 46.26s]  So did you see the title? Yeah, I got my save. I actually just had to go into the PlayStation account settings downloaded the cloud save because I just have my PlayStation gym membership. Right? You just forget that it exists. It just takes out what $10 a month forever. Even if you don't go and work out it still happens. So I was able to have my save. So give me a second while people trickle in.
[46.30s -> 120.49s]  See you in a sec. I just saw somebody say maybe he won't play Minecraft this time. Well, I mean, come on, like I was also drinking heavily that night. So what? I drunkenly played Minecraft. That didn't that I didn't whatever. I remember the last mission that I was on here. I have a distinct memory of walking around in a circle not knowing how to go down to the crash.
[120.57s -> 181.95s]  And I finally figured it out. And now we're moving on to the next part. I'll give you a quick rundown of the story so far hasn't gotten over ruined Kim's Minecraft world. No, that's that's that's in the cloud, man. That's we're good. All right, I gotta move my mic a little bit because I'm trying to trying to increase the volume here. Hold on. Try and find like the right spot where this is not obstructing any view, but it's also good quality. Okay, so let's go like this.
[181.99s -> 229.81s]  And we go like this. And there it is. Make sure it's synced. I know that's been a problem recently. Bring back the headset mic. No. Why on earth would I do that? All right, so here's, here's what you guys have to tell me. So you ready? I'm going to go like this up and down. And you should be hearing a click right when it switches and highlights a different option. Okay. Good. All right, now I'm going to match my voice with it. Ready? 121231231234. We good?
[229.85s -> 281.91s]  Voice is a smidge delayed. Okay, I'll try one more time. 1212312341234. Big delay. Big. So my voice comes after is what you're saying. Because this is an issue I've had recently. So the voice. So it's ready. How about this one? Ready? 121234123412345123412345.
[282.47s -> 332.56s]  All right, it's good. How about now? 1234551212345512. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, G, K, N, F, E, Q, R, S, N, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Are we okay? How about one more time? Can you guys tell? We're good, right? All right, let's go. Welcome back to LA. Oh, never mind. We're going to cut. So I forgot to tell you. I got to tell you the story so far. Wait a minute.
[335.34s -> 352.50s]  I can't pause it, can I? Okay, so this case, there was a crash. Somebody went sailing off the edge. Might have been intentional. Somebody weighed down the pedal. There was an actress involved. There's an ad when the actress is in the car and she might know more than she thinks.
[353.14s -> 361.06s]  Bang, they fly off. I'm going to visit the other lady that was in the car to see if I get more information because man, this might have been a fucking murder attempt. You know what I'm saying?
[361.06s -> 373.42s]  Hello, Detective Phelps. I'm here to interview a Jessica Hamilton.
[373.42s -> 379.22s]  Jessica Hamilton. Oh, yes. She's in the room.
[379.22s -> 381.22s]  You were drunk. Yes, I was.
[381.22s -> 383.46s]  You can't hold me here.
[383.46s -> 385.46s]  We're going to talk to Hamilton.
[385.46s -> 389.77s]  I don't need to be manhandled by a doctor. I need my lawyer.
[389.77s -> 393.77s]  You're little. Where is the telephone? Do you know who I am?
[393.77s -> 395.94s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Who's talking?
[395.94s -> 400.36s]  All right, Jessica, how are you feeling?
[400.36s -> 403.88s]  Hello, Jessica. My name is Paul Phelps.
[405.50s -> 409.50s]  Hard going back here after Red Dead. We might play Red Dead tonight. I don't know.
[409.50s -> 412.63s]  I'd like to talk to you about your accident, if that's okay?
[412.63s -> 414.87s]  Okay.
[414.87s -> 418.87s]  Okay, so remember, here's where I can review. Here's the evidence, okay?
[418.87s -> 425.24s]  There was a Chevy Steinlein. Boom, off the edge. The victims in that car may have been drugged.
[425.24s -> 429.24s]  Somebody sent a letter to her really worried about her and wants her to come home.
[429.24s -> 433.24s]  There was underwear. There was a pair of underwear that I found and I picked them up.
[433.24s -> 437.24s]  Then there was a shrunken head that was weighing down the pedal of the car that went off the edge.
[437.24s -> 443.24s]  Remember, actress, not an actress, but might be at some point, might be a protege to the other actress.
[443.24s -> 444.24s]  I'm ready.
[444.24s -> 448.44s]  Can you tell me what you remember about the crash?
[448.44s -> 453.32s]  It's all kind of fuzzy. I remember waking up here.
[453.32s -> 455.32s]  Nothing happened yesterday.
[455.32s -> 462.60s]  Okay, so she looks a little distraught.
[462.60s -> 465.60s]  I'm going to, let's, we're going to ease into this.
[465.60s -> 467.60s]  You could have died in the crash, Jessica.
[467.60s -> 469.60s]  Why would someone want to kill you?
[469.60s -> 471.03s]  Someone wants to kill me?
[471.03s -> 472.03s]  Got it.
[472.03s -> 478.34s]  I wouldn't know anything about that. I just went along with Junie. She knows all about the movie business.
[478.34s -> 485.58s]  See? Okay, so her parents sent her a letter. She might lie to me here.
[485.58s -> 490.74s]  She looks pretty, yeah, she looks a little distraught. Let's talk about the parents.
[490.74s -> 493.74s]  You need to get in touch with your parents, Jessica, and tell them what has happened.
[493.74s -> 497.74s]  Oh, you don't need to worry them. They sent me along to stay with Aunt June.
[497.74s -> 498.74s]  It's a lie.
[498.74s -> 500.74s]  They trust her to take care of me.
[500.74s -> 508.55s]  That's not true. I can accuse her. I can show the letter, right? Or should I bad cop this?
[508.55s -> 516.18s]  Or is that just doubt? Because, I mean, I do have the letter from Mom saying, come home.
[516.18s -> 522.73s]  You're lying, Jessica. How are we going to make this right if you lie to us?
[522.73s -> 526.54s]  Please, detective, why would I lie to you?
[526.54s -> 531.32s]  I got the letter to prove it. There.
[531.32s -> 536.84s]  Because you're a runaway, Jessica, and you don't have your parents' permission to be here.
[536.84s -> 538.84s]  Now, do you want to tell me what really happened?
[538.84s -> 540.21s]  Got it.
[540.21s -> 544.21s]  I went with June to this strange place. It's difficult to remember.
[544.21s -> 548.21s]  Someone gave me a drink to calm my nerves, and then I felt faint.
[548.21s -> 551.21s]  I think I must have passed out.
[551.21s -> 553.22s]  Okay.
[553.22s -> 557.25s]  So, how did you meet Mr. Bishop?
[557.25s -> 559.25s]  Mr. Bishop is the guy that is involved.
[559.25s -> 565.25s]  June is a big movie star. You probably know that. She's doing a new movie.
[565.25s -> 570.51s]  No, that's a lie. Hold on, wait, is that a lie?
[570.51s -> 576.63s]  Was she in a movie? Was she in like a new movie coming up?
[576.63s -> 583.05s]  I think she was. I think that's, yeah, she was in a movie.
[583.05s -> 585.86s]  What do you know about Bishop?
[585.86s -> 586.86s]  I don't remember.
[586.86s -> 589.86s]  He makes movies. I had to do a screen test.
[589.86s -> 590.86s]  Movies don't exist in the past.
[590.86s -> 595.86s]  That's when you say some lines in front of the camera with the lights turned on you.
[595.86s -> 598.86s]  Okay, what about criminal abuse?
[598.86s -> 604.54s]  I know what happened to you, Jessica. Where exactly did it take place?
[604.54s -> 610.54s]  Please, it's scary. It's really difficult to think of anything.
[610.54s -> 613.78s]  Come on. Come on.
[613.78s -> 625.19s]  What about, uh, this is me on the green screen.
[625.19s -> 627.75s]  We need the information.
[627.75s -> 629.75s]  Someone tried to kill you, Jessica. Do you get it?
[629.75s -> 632.75s]  Forget about being in movies. It's time to act like a grown-up.
[632.75s -> 637.70s]  I had to wear a robe and lay down on a stone.
[637.70s -> 641.94s]  There were lights, camera. It's not my fault.
[641.94s -> 642.94s]  I'm not a bad girl.
[642.94s -> 643.94s]  Tell us where he is.
[643.94s -> 645.94s]  Why are you trying to hurt me?
[645.94s -> 646.94s]  Tell us where he is.
[646.94s -> 647.94s]  You should think about going home, Jessica.
[647.94s -> 648.94s]  One of four, correct?
[648.94s -> 651.94s]  We're going to be mixed up with people who will treat you like last week's trash.
[651.94s -> 652.94s]  What?
[652.94s -> 656.94s]  Are you crazy? I can't go home. I want to be a star.
[656.94s -> 666.13s]  How? I got the letter from the mom. She wants to be in movies.
[666.13s -> 670.13s]  It's the tale of this town, Cole. Lambs that go willingly to slaughter.
[670.13s -> 672.13s]  Who the hell is that?
[672.13s -> 675.13s]  Must be her lawyer. He certainly expedited her release.
[675.13s -> 678.13s]  I don't like it, Cole. Why is she in such a hurry?
[678.13s -> 680.13s]  We should follow her.
[680.13s -> 682.13s]  I didn't have any information.
[682.13s -> 686.13s]  Look, the last time I saw this story was a month ago.
[686.13s -> 690.13s]  If I read you the first five chapters of a book a month ago and then closed it,
[690.13s -> 693.13s]  and then a month later I was like, oh, hey, here's the next chapter,
[693.13s -> 696.13s]  you're going to be like, what are you talking about? What are we doing?
[696.13s -> 702.03s]  Think of all the other pieces of media you've consumed in the last month.
[702.03s -> 711.44s]  Ballard is definitely up to something.
[711.44s -> 716.13s]  I don't even know what the specials were at the restaurant I went to last night.
[716.13s -> 722.95s]  And that happened last night. That was last night.
[722.95s -> 731.82s]  And damn, did they sound good, too.
[731.82s -> 742.72s]  One of them had, it was a pinot sauce, white wine with some kind of fish.
[742.72s -> 745.72s]  It was a wild-caught fish, too, and I almost bought it.
[745.72s -> 747.72s]  But I don't know what it was.
[747.72s -> 763.08s]  You know, I wish there was a thing you could do at restaurants,
[763.08s -> 766.08s]  because they give you the menu, right?
[766.08s -> 768.08s]  Waitress comes over, waiter comes over.
[768.08s -> 770.08s]  Oh, here's your menu. Please take a look at it.
[770.08s -> 774.08s]  And then they come back. Oh, by the way, here are the specials.
[774.08s -> 777.08s]  No, I don't want to hear the specials. Put the specials on the menu.
[777.08s -> 780.08s]  I can't remember the shit that you're telling me.
[780.08s -> 784.08s]  You list off like nine different items and like ten different side dishes.
[784.08s -> 787.08s]  It's like, put it on the fucking menu.
[787.08s -> 796.31s]  I take cover at the door. I don't want to break in here just yet.
[796.31s -> 801.58s]  Enter the cafe without being seen.
[801.58s -> 805.59s]  I can't go through, don't go through the door?
[805.59s -> 816.11s]  Why would it tell me to go to the door?
[816.11s -> 821.57s]  What? Wrong door.
[825.43s -> 828.43s]  Look, we're in a restaurant right now. I can't remember the specials.
[828.43s -> 831.99s]  They were reading specials as I was going up to the door.
[831.99s -> 861.84s]  This guy's going to see me come. That's a newspaper.
[861.84s -> 874.19s]  Newspaper. That's a newspaper.
[882.02s -> 885.52s]  You still know people out here, don't you?
[885.52s -> 892.50s]  Then make some calls.
[892.50s -> 894.50s]  Let me be very clear about this.
[894.50s -> 900.10s]  You get this done or I'm...
[900.10s -> 903.10s]  Wilson's Hotel. Mr. Mark Bishop,
[903.10s -> 906.10s]  that son of a bitch, lives in apartment 803.
[906.10s -> 908.79s]  Got it.
[908.79s -> 911.35s]  Thanks for the info.
[911.35s -> 914.81s]  Sure, I got the film.
[914.81s -> 916.98s]  I got the film.
[916.98s -> 922.55s]  All right, I need to find the film.
[922.55s -> 939.62s]  This is reading the newspaper very close.
[939.62s -> 942.75s]  That would be really embarrassing.
[942.75s -> 945.75s]  So what's the story? I'm guessing she didn't stop to like refreshments.
[945.75s -> 949.75s]  She made a call. Sounds like Mark Bishop has a heap of trouble headed his way.
[949.75s -> 953.75s]  I've got his address. Wilson's Hotel, Apartment 803.
[953.75s -> 955.75s]  Oh, shit. You better step on it.
[955.75s -> 958.75s]  If he's got any sense, he'll be as far away from home as possible.
[958.75s -> 963.75s]  If he had any sense, he wouldn't have tried bumping off Guy McAfee's wife in the first place.
[963.75s -> 965.75s]  Or he'd have done the job properly.
[965.75s -> 967.75s]  McAfee will break a fella's legs just for looking at him.
[967.75s -> 969.75s]  You know what I want? Back on the restaurant bullshit again.
[969.75s -> 971.75s]  What did you make of the kid?
[971.75s -> 973.75s]  Do you believe her story?
[973.75s -> 976.75s]  I think she was dumped out of her tiny mind and given the casting couch.
[976.75s -> 979.75s]  That fucking bitch Ballard sold her out.
[979.75s -> 987.56s]  Okay, so if Ballard was doing someone a favor, why did they try to kill her?
[987.56s -> 989.56s]  What I want in a rescue front?
[989.56s -> 995.44s]  Take it easy, Phelps. I'd rather get there in one piece.
[995.44s -> 997.44s]  I think I can fix this.
[997.44s -> 1001.09s]  All units in the vicinity in corridor 15, front.
[1001.09s -> 1011.58s]  Advice?
[1011.58s -> 1014.58s]  Get to the car before someone gets hurt.
[1014.58s -> 1016.58s]  You got any advice?
[1016.58s -> 1018.58s]  Give me another car.
[1018.58s -> 1021.08s]  Do we need to have that car?
[1021.08s -> 1029.04s]  Come here.
[1029.04s -> 1032.04s]  I don't want to go too far away. It'll fail the mission.
[1032.04s -> 1034.79s]  I think I have to be in that car.
[1034.79s -> 1040.85s]  I'm sorry, sir. Police officer. I need your car.
[1040.85s -> 1048.78s]  What? I think I have to be in that car, don't I?
[1048.78s -> 1051.41s]  Will he get in this?
[1051.41s -> 1054.48s]  I might have to dislodge this car.
[1054.48s -> 1057.36s]  Yeah, okay.
[1060.52s -> 1069.59s]  I can't even get up there.
[1069.59s -> 1081.15s]  How did I do this? I just fell off the edge.
[1081.15s -> 1085.67s]  I hope I don't need this guy.
[1085.67s -> 1088.67s]  Just fall off the edge again and dislodge the car.
[1088.67s -> 1091.67s]  I still have the marker.
[1091.67s -> 1098.39s]  Delete your save.
[1098.39s -> 1108.01s]  Is he running right now after the car?
[1108.01s -> 1117.49s]  Can you imagine a cop taking your car to commandeer it to drive into their car that is stuck?
[1117.49s -> 1130.01s]  That would be pretty weird.
[1130.01s -> 1134.91s]  You're a loose cannon, Jeremy. You're off to Cates.
[1134.91s -> 1137.66s]  They need somebody like me.
[1137.66s -> 1143.89s]  I might not do it well, but I get it done.
[1143.89s -> 1148.66s]  Except for that. That was really well done.
[1148.66s -> 1151.48s]  Did he say turn right?
[1151.48s -> 1161.78s]  Do I think he's in the car with me?
[1161.78s -> 1170.53s]  He got up. Bishop's apartment.
[1170.53s -> 1175.53s]  I'm Detective Phelps. We received a call about a domestic disturbance in Apartment 803.
[1175.53s -> 1178.53s]  He gets the option to do good cop, bad cop work.
[1178.53s -> 1181.53s]  Take the elevator and then left down the corridor. It's the last door on the right.
[1181.53s -> 1183.53s]  Officer, that was a lie.
[1183.53s -> 1185.53s]  Oh, shit. Yeah, it was.
[1185.53s -> 1199.02s]  Sounds like we're about to make it a hat trick of hysterical female witnesses.
[1199.02s -> 1201.46s]  Take the elevator where? He didn't say which floor.
[1201.46s -> 1204.46s]  There's probably only five, six floors apparently.
[1204.46s -> 1206.46s]  He said last door on the right.
[1206.46s -> 1210.74s]  There it is.
[1210.74s -> 1212.74s]  No, that's not correct.
[1212.74s -> 1219.02s]  Where's 803?
[1219.02s -> 1222.02s]  He said on the right. Did he say take a left? I don't know.
[1222.02s -> 1227.69s]  Hello? Did he say take a left first?
[1239.60s -> 1241.60s]  No, this place was torn apart.
[1253.60s -> 1255.60s]  Didn't you see her?
[1255.60s -> 1257.60s]  No, no, that was somebody else.
[1257.60s -> 1261.62s]  That was somebody else.
[1261.62s -> 1263.62s]  Okay, so we got some stuff to look at.
[1263.62s -> 1267.44s]  There's a vase.
[1271.65s -> 1277.52s]  Is it the Bible?
[1277.52s -> 1279.52s]  I don't think this is going to help us.
[1279.52s -> 1282.70s]  I don't know. God can't help us now, apparently.
[1282.70s -> 1294.65s]  What?
[1294.65s -> 1296.65s]  It's the Bible.
[1296.65s -> 1299.65s]  What do you mean, the Bible? It's the Bible.
[1299.65s -> 1301.65s]  It doesn't appear to be connected.
[1301.65s -> 1306.55s]  It's what? It's a Bible?
[1306.55s -> 1317.56s]  Presented to Mark.
[1317.56s -> 1321.78s]  Okay.
[1321.78s -> 1327.48s]  What's this? A fight game?
[1327.48s -> 1334.39s]  Ooh, five dollars.
[1334.39s -> 1336.39s]  I'll take it.
[1336.39s -> 1338.39s]  Optimistic, Cole.
[1338.39s -> 1341.85s]  It's got some nice weight to it.
[1341.85s -> 1349.34s]  I don't think so.
[1349.34s -> 1353.10s]  Put it down.
[1353.10s -> 1355.10s]  Twenty-five dollar bounty for stealing.
[1355.10s -> 1359.83s]  Apparently it's rock star week on this channel.
[1359.83s -> 1363.83s]  But to be fair, they do make some of the best games.
[1363.83s -> 1367.27s]  Old movie set.
[1367.27s -> 1374.89s]  Anything on it?
[1374.89s -> 1376.89s]  There's a bunch of stuff here.
[1376.89s -> 1378.89s]  Great wall of Babylon.
[1378.89s -> 1380.89s]  A replica of a replica.
[1380.89s -> 1384.73s]  Movie set replica.
[1384.73s -> 1387.99s]  Of a replica.
[1387.99s -> 1391.06s]  But this is not made by a rock star.
[1391.06s -> 1393.06s]  I don't think this is anything.
[1393.06s -> 1395.06s]  But they pressed accept on it.
[1395.06s -> 1397.37s]  You know what I mean?
[1397.37s -> 1399.37s]  They opened the email with the file in it for the EXE.
[1399.37s -> 1408.58s]  You know what I mean?
[1408.58s -> 1410.58s]  I don't think there's anything else in here.
[1410.58s -> 1417.18s]  What about this clock?
[1417.18s -> 1426.26s]  This painting.
[1426.26s -> 1434.18s]  Kitchen. Secret room.
[1434.18s -> 1436.18s]  A couple of melee weapons.
[1436.18s -> 1446.98s]  I don't think I need these.
[1446.98s -> 1448.98s]  Nothing else?
[1448.98s -> 1450.98s]  Just like coffee cups and shit.
[1454.25s -> 1456.25s]  The salad fork is going to blow this gate wide open.
[1464.06s -> 1466.06s]  What is going on?
[1466.06s -> 1471.69s]  What is happening in the chat room?
[1471.69s -> 1473.69s]  There was just like an unleashing of a Jupiter storm.
[1473.69s -> 1479.05s]  I need to get like the...
[1484.41s -> 1487.48s]  Mermaid in the background.
[1487.48s -> 1490.04s]  Silver screen.
[1490.04s -> 1492.04s]  What are these men in the picture?
[1492.04s -> 1494.86s]  My husband, Mark.
[1494.86s -> 1496.86s]  And Marlin Hopgood.
[1496.86s -> 1498.86s]  They work together on occasion.
[1498.86s -> 1501.10s]  That's Hopgood's shop.
[1501.10s -> 1503.10s]  Marlin Hopgood.
[1503.10s -> 1506.36s]  That's a new character.
[1506.36s -> 1514.60s]  There's a dog.
[1514.60s -> 1516.60s]  Another time and place.
[1516.60s -> 1526.97s]  I'm not talking yet.
[1526.97s -> 1531.62s]  Nothing?
[1531.62s -> 1538.73s]  Balcony?
[1538.73s -> 1540.73s]  Okay.
[1540.73s -> 1542.73s]  Anything else?
[1542.73s -> 1552.25s]  Alright.
[1552.25s -> 1557.56s]  Is there broken glass on the door?
[1557.56s -> 1561.21s]  This door is like broken.
[1561.21s -> 1563.21s]  This door is all fucked up.
[1563.21s -> 1565.21s]  Can I close the door and look at it?
[1565.21s -> 1576.79s]  I can't close this door.
[1576.79s -> 1578.79s]  Until I get a better look at it.
[1578.79s -> 1580.79s]  Do a cool trick off the balcony.
[1580.79s -> 1589.11s]  I can't.
[1589.11s -> 1591.80s]  Apparently I'm missing something else.
[1591.80s -> 1593.80s]  That, which I don't know.
[1593.80s -> 1595.80s]  Is the clock that I was talking about before I told you.
[1595.80s -> 1602.63s]  Nope.
[1602.63s -> 1604.63s]  What were they looking for?
[1604.63s -> 1610.14s]  Have you talked to the lady?
[1610.14s -> 1612.14s]  I've not talked to the lady, but don't...
[1612.14s -> 1614.14s]  Isn't there another musical cue when you find all the clues?
[1614.14s -> 1623.99s]  Can I offer you an egg in these trying times?
[1623.99s -> 1625.99s]  What are you guys doing?
[1625.99s -> 1633.53s]  Oh! That was a big gotcha moment.
[1633.53s -> 1638.57s]  There's a check here.
[1638.57s -> 1640.57s]  $20,000.
[1640.57s -> 1642.57s]  $20,000.
[1642.57s -> 1645.19s]  Two...
[1645.19s -> 1647.19s]  That's another language. I can't read it because it's cursive.
[1647.19s -> 1649.88s]  Lupra...
[1649.88s -> 1652.12s]  Allo rule.
[1652.12s -> 1660.42s]  Got it.
[1660.42s -> 1664.58s]  Hey! Can I ask you some questions?
[1664.58s -> 1667.78s]  What's up?
[1667.78s -> 1669.78s]  What about that check on the ground?
[1669.78s -> 1671.78s]  Who are you paying?
[1671.78s -> 1675.24s]  Do you know the name?
[1675.24s -> 1677.24s]  June Ballard is married to Guy McCaffey.
[1677.24s -> 1680.12s]  Have you heard of her?
[1680.12s -> 1682.12s]  That slut.
[1682.12s -> 1684.12s]  I've been flattering my husband for days.
[1684.12s -> 1688.12s]  Mrs. McCaffey alleges that your husband tried to kill her and her friend last night.
[1688.12s -> 1690.12s]  I think you should tell us what you know.
[1690.12s -> 1692.62s]  My husband's a movie producer.
[1692.62s -> 1694.62s]  This has something to do with his new picture.
[1694.62s -> 1696.62s]  He doesn't include me in his business.
[1696.62s -> 1698.62s]  Let me look at the notebook.
[1698.62s -> 1701.18s]  What about...
[1701.18s -> 1703.48s]  The letter from your mother.
[1703.48s -> 1705.48s]  She wants you to come home.
[1705.48s -> 1707.48s]  Who wrote this check?
[1707.48s -> 1735.88s]  I did.
[1735.88s -> 1737.88s]  Aye, aye, aye.
[1737.88s -> 1739.88s]  Aye, aye, aye.
[1739.88s -> 1741.88s]  Can we get on with this, please?
[1741.88s -> 1745.08s]  I'm an officer of the law, ma'am.
[1745.08s -> 1756.92s]  Mmm...
[1756.92s -> 1759.35s]  I don't believe it.
[1759.35s -> 1761.35s]  June Ballard said she had a deal to be in his new picture.
[1761.35s -> 1763.35s]  Mark repeatedly told her no.
[1763.35s -> 1765.66s]  He had Joan Leslie lined up for the role.
[1765.66s -> 1767.66s]  That's how he got the finance.
[1767.66s -> 1769.66s]  June made all kinds of threats.
[1769.66s -> 1771.66s]  She was very rude to me.
[1771.66s -> 1773.66s]  You know June Ballard?
[1773.66s -> 1775.66s]  We were both on the same picture a few years back.
[1775.66s -> 1778.02s]  That's how I am.
[1778.02s -> 1780.02s]  Whose dead eye?
[1780.02s -> 1783.67s]  Do you know
[1783.67s -> 1785.67s]  where Bishop is?
[1785.67s -> 1787.67s]  Where can we find your husband, ma'am?
[1787.67s -> 1789.67s]  He told me he would be on set. That's all I know.
[1789.67s -> 1796.25s]  Is it?
[1796.25s -> 1798.25s]  If he was practicing in the mirror for this part...
[1798.25s -> 1803.43s]  What about this underwear? Do you know what this is?
[1803.43s -> 1809.96s]  Either we find him, or McAfee's people do, Mrs. Bishop.
[1809.96s -> 1811.96s]  If you care for him,
[1811.96s -> 1813.96s]  you should make sure that we find him first.
[1813.96s -> 1817.22s]  I do care for him.
[1817.22s -> 1819.22s]  But I don't really know
[1819.22s -> 1821.22s]  where he'd go if he were in trouble.
[1821.22s -> 1823.46s]  Hopgood might know.
[1823.46s -> 1827.11s]  Okay, the trace address of Prop Store.
[1827.11s -> 1829.11s]  Now who is this check for $20,000 for?
[1829.11s -> 1831.11s]  Why is your husband paying Lorna Hopgood
[1831.11s -> 1833.11s]  $20,000?
[1833.11s -> 1835.11s]  Lorna?
[1835.11s -> 1837.54s]  Marlin's ex-wife?
[1837.54s -> 1842.01s]  Are you sure?
[1842.01s -> 1853.58s]  Yeah.
[1853.58s -> 1855.58s]  We got her.
[1855.58s -> 1857.58s]  I have the check.
[1857.58s -> 1859.58s]  But I don't accuse.
[1859.58s -> 1861.58s]  I mean, I do have the check.
[1861.58s -> 1864.65s]  But what if she didn't
[1864.65s -> 1869.32s]  write it, though?
[1869.32s -> 1871.32s]  You're lying, Mrs. Bishop.
[1871.32s -> 1873.32s]  It's some kind of payoff. You know exactly
[1873.32s -> 1875.32s]  what the money is for and who it's getting paid to.
[1875.32s -> 1877.80s]  Do I?
[1877.80s -> 1879.80s]  Would you like to prove that, detective?
[1879.80s -> 1881.80s]  Yeah.
[1881.80s -> 1884.42s]  I got the check right here.
[1884.42s -> 1886.42s]  $20,000 made out to
[1886.42s -> 1889.69s]  Lorna
[1889.69s -> 1891.69s]  Hopgood on the account of Mark Bishop.
[1891.69s -> 1899.75s]  I got it.
[1899.75s -> 1901.75s]  Your husband looks like he's being blackmailed.
[1901.75s -> 1903.75s]  They obviously have something on him. If he's prepared to kill to cover it up,
[1903.75s -> 1905.75s]  why is the payment going to Hopgood
[1905.75s -> 1907.93s]  and not McAfee?
[1907.93s -> 1909.93s]  Lorna works at a check cashing place in
[1909.93s -> 1911.93s]  Hollywood. You need to ask
[1911.93s -> 1913.93s]  Hopgood why he needs that much money in
[1913.93s -> 1916.74s]  cash.
[1916.74s -> 1918.74s]  Your husband is in trouble. It could go easier
[1918.74s -> 1920.74s]  for him if you were more helpful, Mrs. Bishop.
[1920.74s -> 1923.37s]  Perfect score!
[1923.37s -> 1925.37s]  You're a big boy, detective, and so are you.
[1925.37s -> 1927.37s]  This is Hollywood.
[1927.37s -> 1929.37s]  There's always a deal to be done.
[1929.37s -> 1932.06s]  By the way, your necklace
[1932.06s -> 1934.06s]  is out of focus. Just want to make sure, you know,
[1934.06s -> 1936.06s]  take care of that.
[1936.06s -> 1939.06s]  Hello, I need to use the telephone.
[1939.06s -> 1942.90s]  Operator, give me R&I.
[1942.90s -> 1947.06s]  Putting you through now.
[1947.06s -> 1951.10s]  Phelps, batch 1247.
[1951.10s -> 1953.10s]  Detective?
[1953.10s -> 1955.10s]  I need a location on a silver screen prop store.
[1955.10s -> 1958.04s]  Just a moment.
[1958.04s -> 1961.05s]  Smartest streamer on Twitch.
[1961.05s -> 1963.80s]  Thanks, man.
[1963.80s -> 1970.39s]  Investigate silver screen props.
[1970.39s -> 1974.36s]  Get out of the way.
[1974.36s -> 1981.40s]  Use your own phone. Get out of my house.
[1981.40s -> 1984.92s]  Open up your cell phone, man.
[1984.92s -> 1986.92s]  I know this takes place.
[1986.92s -> 1988.92s]  Small complaint about the game.
[1988.92s -> 1990.92s]  I know this takes place in the 40s, but
[1990.92s -> 1992.92s]  fucking it's modern times now, man.
[1992.92s -> 1994.92s]  Just let them have a phone or something.
[1994.92s -> 1996.92s]  Let them have a pawnpilot with GPS and everything.
[1996.92s -> 1998.92s]  It's really annoying.
[2006.66s -> 2008.66s]  This game released in like 2007.
[2008.66s -> 2010.66s]  I know it's like 1937 or
[2010.66s -> 2012.66s]  1942 or whatever it is, but
[2012.66s -> 2015.54s]  no gamer wants to play like this.
[2015.54s -> 2017.54s]  Give me a fucking pawnpilot.
[2017.54s -> 2022.92s]  Mrs. Bishop knows more than she's letting on.
[2022.92s -> 2024.92s]  She doesn't seem to realize how much trouble
[2024.92s -> 2026.92s]  her husband is in.
[2026.92s -> 2028.92s]  The LAPD are the least of their worries right now.
[2028.92s -> 2030.92s]  You think she'd have gotten the hint that
[2030.92s -> 2032.92s]  the hatchet man redecorated her apartment?
[2032.92s -> 2034.92s]  Maybe she's just loyal.
[2034.92s -> 2036.92s]  No, they didn't have hint.
[2036.92s -> 2038.92s]  Small complaint about the game.
[2038.92s -> 2040.92s]  I know it's like 1940, but
[2040.92s -> 2042.92s]  where the fuck is the...
[2042.92s -> 2044.92s]  There's a handbrake on every car now.
[2044.92s -> 2046.92s]  Just put a handbrake in the game.
[2046.92s -> 2061.96s]  It's really irritating.
[2061.96s -> 2063.96s]  There is a handbrake.
[2063.96s -> 2065.96s]  I just pulled it.
[2071.53s -> 2082.73s]  It's like music.
[2082.73s -> 2085.29s]  Small complaint about the game.
[2085.29s -> 2087.66s]  Fucking seriously.
[2087.66s -> 2089.66s]  It's like 2007, 2008.
[2089.66s -> 2091.66s]  They claimed this boring, dumb shit music.
[2091.66s -> 2093.66s]  It's fucking irritating.
[2093.66s -> 2095.66s]  It's like Limp Bizkit.
[2095.66s -> 2097.66s]  They put like current music on it.
[2097.66s -> 2099.66s]  It's fucking annoying.
[2099.66s -> 2102.22s]  Watch what you're doing!
[2102.22s -> 2112.20s]  Why can't I put my own custom playlist?
[2112.20s -> 2123.59s]  They can
[2123.59s -> 2125.59s]  update the rosters on Madden and
[2125.59s -> 2127.59s]  MLB the show and stuff.
[2127.59s -> 2129.59s]  Why can't they update the playlists and the current radio stations?
[2129.59s -> 2131.59s]  Fucking annoying.
[2131.59s -> 2133.77s]  It's gonna get points off the game.
[2133.77s -> 2135.77s]  For real though, I just wanna make sure you guys are aware of that.
[2140.38s -> 2146.33s]  End this.
[2146.33s -> 2148.33s]  Someone's in that shoot of armor!
[2162.47s -> 2164.47s]  No, I'm not gonna do the sound.
[2164.47s -> 2170.94s]  The bare default sound.
[2170.94s -> 2172.94s]  Sorry.
[2172.94s -> 2176.78s]  Plus, a car just made it
[2176.78s -> 2178.78s]  driving by, so I didn't even have to do it.
[2178.78s -> 2194.52s]  Shoot the armor before it gets you.
[2194.52s -> 2197.66s]  This is here. Soundstage.
[2201.66s -> 2206.14s]  Let's have a look around.
[2206.14s -> 2211.77s]  Ooh,
[2211.77s -> 2213.77s]  would you look at that?
[2213.77s -> 2217.16s]  Ah, I found one of these
[2217.16s -> 2219.16s]  at the crime scene.
[2219.16s -> 2226.76s]  Didn't I?
[2226.76s -> 2228.76s]  Looks eerily familiar.
[2228.76s -> 2234.26s]  Is there a reason why I haven't said anything about that yet?
[2234.26s -> 2240.71s]  Why won't I
[2240.71s -> 2244.49s]  say anything about this?
[2244.49s -> 2246.49s]  Do I have to find a certain thing on it?
[2246.49s -> 2248.49s]  Because he's not like, oh,
[2248.49s -> 2262.25s]  there's a guy in there.
[2262.25s -> 2268.26s]  Ah.
[2278.97s -> 2280.97s]  This guy's got a peep den.
[2280.97s -> 2283.27s]  And there's drugs here too.
[2283.27s -> 2286.46s]  So this guy,
[2286.46s -> 2288.46s]  this guy is a bad man.
[2292.46s -> 2294.89s]  Well, gotcha.
[2294.89s -> 2298.60s]  See, now you're fucked.
[2298.60s -> 2319.06s]  Something else back here?
[2319.06s -> 2324.38s]  No?
[2324.38s -> 2326.38s]  Hold on.
[2326.38s -> 2328.38s]  They're everywhere. I already know that.
[2328.38s -> 2333.43s]  Yeah, I got a little soundstage.
[2333.43s -> 2335.43s]  You're gonna rot.
[2335.43s -> 2341.00s]  Can't be that way, Phelps.
[2341.00s -> 2343.00s]  You couldn't fit a rat through there.
[2343.00s -> 2349.19s]  It's right here.
[2349.19s -> 2351.19s]  There's a secret button on the wall.
[2351.19s -> 2356.10s]  How do I turn the light off here?
[2356.10s -> 2358.10s]  Where's the book that I have to pull out for the
[2358.10s -> 2366.55s]  wall to collapse?
[2366.55s -> 2381.34s]  It's right back here. Toilet paper roll?
[2381.34s -> 2383.34s]  Flush the toilet?
[2383.34s -> 2392.41s]  Wait, hold on.
[2392.41s -> 2396.18s]  Not everything here is going to be relevant.
[2396.18s -> 2405.77s]  Ah.
[2405.77s -> 2407.77s]  In the dumpster. Secret dumpster entrance.
[2407.77s -> 2419.27s]  No, nevermind.
[2419.27s -> 2421.83s]  Do you really have the fucking
[2421.83s -> 2425.03s]  ACME Road Runner
[2425.03s -> 2427.03s]  set up where, I mean, if that was a cartoon,
[2427.03s -> 2429.03s]  I'd be able to run through that.
[2429.03s -> 2431.03s]  And then the guy behind me would chase me and
[2431.03s -> 2434.62s]  smash into that.
[2434.62s -> 2436.62s]  Well, this is the 40s.
[2436.62s -> 2438.62s]  So that was relevant. Those things did work on people back then.
[2438.62s -> 2441.56s]  Okay.
[2441.56s -> 2443.99s]  So we have a secret camera room.
[2443.99s -> 2445.99s]  That's not fucked up at all.
[2445.99s -> 2447.99s]  Okay.
[2447.99s -> 2452.33s]  What's over here? What's that?
[2452.33s -> 2459.05s]  There's the toilet.
[2459.05s -> 2465.51s]  Okay, there's all these photos.
[2465.51s -> 2468.58s]  I wonder if they saw this,
[2468.58s -> 2470.58s]  how many budding starlets would still get on the bus
[2470.58s -> 2472.58s]  to come to Hollywood.
[2472.58s -> 2479.48s]  So, I was going to say, why am I stuck there?
[2479.48s -> 2489.96s]  Okay.
[2489.96s -> 2491.96s]  We've got, oh, this is the
[2491.96s -> 2493.96s]  film, I think, right?
[2493.96s -> 2497.29s]  So we've got a
[2497.29s -> 2499.29s]  Jungle Drums.
[2499.29s -> 2501.29s]  Eighth and Francisco.
[2501.29s -> 2503.29s]  These guys were running like a fucking fucked up
[2503.29s -> 2505.29s]  like secret spy.
[2505.29s -> 2507.46s]  Yeah.
[2507.46s -> 2510.79s]  What are you going to do with this?
[2510.79s -> 2515.08s]  Phelps, put on gloves, man.
[2515.08s -> 2520.39s]  You're tainting the scene.
[2520.39s -> 2524.55s]  Let's take a look at this one. These, like, creepy fucks
[2524.55s -> 2526.55s]  just filming people behind the wall.
[2526.55s -> 2531.03s]  Hmm.
[2531.03s -> 2537.88s]  Interesting.
[2537.88s -> 2547.67s]  I don't need any butterscotch.
[2547.67s -> 2551.13s]  Okay.
[2551.13s -> 2558.04s]  This is just somebody sat back here.
[2558.04s -> 2562.58s]  So, somebody had to,
[2562.58s -> 2564.58s]  it was a two-man
[2564.58s -> 2566.58s]  thing here. Cause somebody had to upright the camera.
[2566.58s -> 2568.58s]  They're both, and they're both guilty.
[2568.58s -> 2573.26s]  Is there anything else that I missed in here?
[2573.26s -> 2576.33s]  Sure, I didn't.
[2576.33s -> 2578.76s]  There's that. I got that.
[2578.76s -> 2581.88s]  I got that.
[2581.88s -> 2586.81s]  Nothing else? That's it.
[2586.81s -> 2592.25s]  But, there is a bunch of this,
[2592.25s -> 2595.19s]  this thing. What about back here?
[2595.19s -> 2599.35s]  Painting these.
[2599.35s -> 2601.91s]  All right. Well, this is very clearly.
[2601.91s -> 2603.91s]  Okay.
[2603.91s -> 2605.91s]  That's the one.
[2605.91s -> 2607.91s]  This is where you sprang from.
[2607.91s -> 2610.09s]  Here are the molds.
[2610.09s -> 2615.27s]  Should I take one of these?
[2615.27s -> 2622.89s]  I guess that, yeah, that's just, they're just making them.
[2622.89s -> 2626.98s]  This game, well, this game came out
[2626.98s -> 2628.98s]  in 1940, cause that's when it takes place.
[2628.98s -> 2639.86s]  Flood streets,
[2639.86s -> 2641.86s]  cops chase, war, surplus, contraband.
[2643.86s -> 2647.26s]  Let's take a look.
[2663.26s -> 2665.26s]  You want to be a doctor, and a dope peddler.
[2665.26s -> 2667.56s]  Interesting combination, huh?
[2667.56s -> 2671.02s]  Do we have a problem,
[2671.02s -> 2673.02s]  Mr. Cohen?
[2673.02s -> 2675.51s]  We might have. Yeah.
[2675.51s -> 2677.51s]  Selling your dope to my boy Lenny looked like a good move,
[2677.51s -> 2679.51s]  but Lenny has been supplying, uh,
[2679.51s -> 2681.51s]  wholesale, so to speak.
[2681.51s -> 2683.51s]  The Bindle Boys in this town
[2683.51s -> 2685.51s]  aren't used to the juice without a little of the middle man
[2685.51s -> 2687.51s]  taking his cut.
[2687.51s -> 2690.84s]  Lenny promised that wouldn't happen, Mr. Cohen.
[2690.84s -> 2693.46s]  And Lenny works for you.
[2693.46s -> 2695.96s]  What can I say about Lenny?
[2695.96s -> 2698.33s]  Let me think. Oh, yeah,
[2698.33s -> 2700.33s]  he's a putz, and he's lazy,
[2700.33s -> 2702.33s]  and he's greedy, but he's my wife's brother.
[2702.33s -> 2704.33s]  What were the specials again? I don't remember.
[2704.33s -> 2706.33s]  You have to make a cake with those ingredients, huh?
[2706.33s -> 2708.82s]  That was a bad call back.
[2708.82s -> 2710.82s]  So how was that my problem, Mr. Cohen?
[2710.82s -> 2713.13s]  Well, kids, the only way we're going to be able
[2713.13s -> 2715.13s]  to make this work is to do some repackaging.
[2715.13s -> 2717.13s]  We need to get the dope out of those dinky little cardboard
[2717.13s -> 2719.13s]  boxes. So we're putting them in the heads.
[2719.13s -> 2721.43s]  Dope in the heads.
[2721.43s -> 2723.86s]  Yeah, so reds. Great. We can put it into a big
[2723.86s -> 2725.86s]  vat so we can water it down a little bit.
[2725.86s -> 2728.74s]  Who bore you with the chemistry?
[2728.74s -> 2730.74s]  But it doesn't work that way.
[2730.74s -> 2733.18s]  You're likely to kill even more people.
[2733.18s -> 2735.18s]  Okay. Listen.
[2735.18s -> 2737.18s]  We want to buy you out, kid. What did I eat last night?
[2737.18s -> 2739.18s]  I'll offer you 50 grand.
[2739.18s -> 2742.36s]  Water.
[2742.36s -> 2744.36s]  There was water in...
[2744.36s -> 2746.36s]  Hey. Hey! A salt.
[2746.36s -> 2748.36s]  You don't like my offer? I forget everything else.
[2748.36s -> 2758.54s]  Where'd the phone come from?
[2758.54s -> 2760.54s]  Whose phone is this? I think I want him dead.
[2760.54s -> 2762.78s]  Thanks for the
[2762.78s -> 2764.78s]  part of the table under the seat
[2764.78s -> 2772.52s]  telephone.
[2772.52s -> 2774.52s]  The logistics of having a phone at that table back
[2774.52s -> 2776.52s]  in 1940.
[2776.52s -> 2778.52s]  That cable has to run through the whole restaurant.
[2778.52s -> 2785.56s]  People are going to trip over that.
[2785.56s -> 2792.41s]  All right. So we got some info here.
[2792.41s -> 2794.71s]  There's dope
[2794.71s -> 2800.41s]  is involved.
[2800.41s -> 2802.41s]  They're like, I'm going to cut one of these open.
[2802.41s -> 2815.40s]  Hello? I'm going to cut one of
[2815.40s -> 2817.40s]  those open. There's going to be dope in there.
[2817.40s -> 2819.40s]  Oh, come on. Let's go.
[2819.40s -> 2821.40s]  Come on, girl.
[2821.40s -> 2826.07s]  That's a good girl.
[2826.07s -> 2828.07s]  I played that other game. I played that other game.
[2828.07s -> 2833.56s]  And see? These were all
[2833.56s -> 2835.56s]  taken from Red Dead. Didn't I tell you?
[2835.56s -> 2840.49s]  Red Dead. Red Dead.
[2840.49s -> 2842.49s]  Red Dead.
[2842.49s -> 2850.41s]  That's a different game.
[2850.41s -> 2852.41s]  I got enough evidence to put this guy away for life.
[2852.41s -> 2858.94s]  So don't worry.
[2858.94s -> 2860.94s]  All right. Skip the dialogue. You're going
[2860.94s -> 2866.82s]  away for life.
[2866.82s -> 2868.82s]  You ever do any work for Mark Bishop?
[2868.82s -> 2871.13s]  Mainly do work for the studios.
[2871.13s -> 2873.13s]  RKO, Republic,
[2873.13s -> 2875.80s]  Warner Brothers. So yeah.
[2875.80s -> 2878.17s]  And Bishop is doing work for a studio.
[2878.17s -> 2880.17s]  Yes. When did you last see him?
[2880.17s -> 2882.34s]  Yeah, I'm doing work for his next picture.
[2882.34s -> 2885.98s]  Still pre-production though.
[2885.98s -> 2888.41s]  Is it? I haven't seen him around here
[2888.41s -> 2890.41s]  in a while. Really?
[2890.41s -> 2893.22s]  Hmm. Haven't seen him
[2893.22s -> 2895.53s]  around in a while, have you?
[2895.53s -> 2897.53s]  This letter from your mother says otherwise.
[2897.53s -> 2901.05s]  She's looking for you and she's
[2901.05s -> 2906.81s]  worried about you. All right, hold on.
[2906.81s -> 2908.81s]  This is the movie set photographer,
[2908.81s -> 2910.81s]  photographer, prop store photographer.
[2910.81s -> 2913.24s]  When was this taken?
[2913.24s -> 2921.30s]  It's got to be like a date somewhere, right?
[2921.30s -> 2933.08s]  Film reel. I mean,
[2933.08s -> 2935.08s]  like, when was this taken?
[2935.08s -> 2937.08s]  The mermaid statue.
[2939.08s -> 2944.01s]  How would that prove, like, that date
[2944.01s -> 2946.01s]  though? Is there a date on here?
[2946.01s -> 2956.10s]  What's the date?
[2956.10s -> 2958.10s]  Should I just accuse him and just put up the checkout?
[2958.10s -> 2960.10s]  No. I mean, like, he's clearly
[2960.10s -> 2962.10s]  in the photo here, but this is from
[2962.10s -> 2964.54s]  the mermaid movie.
[2964.54s -> 2968.31s]  Do I have any other information
[2968.31s -> 2976.38s]  besides that? I mean, this is
[2976.38s -> 2978.74s]  ugh.
[2978.74s -> 2980.74s]  I don't know the date on here. This could be any time.
[2980.74s -> 2989.90s]  Hold on a minute.
[3022.18s -> 3029.93s]  Like, none of these mean anything
[3029.93s -> 3031.93s]  though. What about, like, the fucking hidden cameras?
[3031.93s -> 3035.38s]  Why can't I bring that up?
[3035.38s -> 3037.69s]  I have, like, a check
[3037.69s -> 3039.69s]  and, like, a photo of these two.
[3039.69s -> 3046.22s]  How would that determine where...
[3046.22s -> 3048.22s]  Do you know where he is? I have a photo of you
[3048.22s -> 3055.38s]  too. And what about the drugs?
[3055.38s -> 3057.38s]  Like, I can't be like, hey, why do you have the...
[3057.38s -> 3059.38s]  I can't just be like, what is this?
[3070.34s -> 3072.34s]  Like, the empty... Yeah, but that's not the
[3072.34s -> 3074.34s]  question though. The question was like, do you know where he is?
[3074.34s -> 3076.71s]  Why isn't the first question
[3076.71s -> 3078.71s]  like, hey, what's with the drugs and cameras?
[3112.81s -> 3114.81s]  How would I know?
[3114.81s -> 3116.81s]  How would I be able to get the information of
[3116.81s -> 3118.81s]  where he is?
[3118.81s -> 3120.81s]  Where is he?
[3120.81s -> 3122.81s]  I have a picture of them two on a
[3122.81s -> 3124.81s]  set, but when was that taken?
[3138.81s -> 3141.24s]  So is this the reason why I can't bring up
[3141.24s -> 3143.24s]  all the other stuff?
[3147.74s -> 3149.74s]  Are you thinking too hard about it?
[3149.74s -> 3151.74s]  Was it really just as simple as
[3151.74s -> 3153.74s]  here's a photo of you two?
[3153.74s -> 3155.74s]  Like, that's it.
[3177.74s -> 3179.74s]  It's the simplest answer.
[3207.98s -> 3209.98s]  He will be bringing Mark Bishop into custody.
[3209.98s -> 3212.15s]  At least he's polite.
[3212.15s -> 3214.15s]  Kinda dumb.
[3214.15s -> 3216.15s]  But polite.
[3220.15s -> 3222.15s]  So it's just all red herrings and then one item is
[3222.15s -> 3224.15s]  correct or something? Is that how this game works?
[3226.15s -> 3228.15s]  Just pick up a bunch of evidence and then there's one
[3228.15s -> 3230.15s]  question. Please press this button on this one
[3230.15s -> 3232.15s]  thing.
[3239.99s -> 3250.94s]  Why?
[3250.94s -> 3252.94s]  Why would you start shooting?
[3252.94s -> 3259.06s]  Okay.
[3259.06s -> 3261.06s]  That came out of nowhere.
[3261.06s -> 3263.06s]  I didn't do anything.
[3263.06s -> 3266.20s]  Should I shoot?
[3273.45s -> 3276.65s]  Am I...am I was an accident here?
[3278.65s -> 3284.15s]  Alright, shoot him.
[3284.15s -> 3286.65s]  There are two cars here.
[3291.34s -> 3293.34s]  Okay.
[3295.34s -> 3297.34s]  It worked, but...
[3297.34s -> 3303.86s]  That guy is getting
[3303.86s -> 3306.04s]  stepped on.
[3306.04s -> 3308.54s]  Why would he get out of the car?
[3319.35s -> 3321.35s]  Alright, I did it.
[3325.35s -> 3327.35s]  Let's go to the set.
[3335.35s -> 3337.35s]  Kathy really means business.
[3337.35s -> 3339.35s]  Seems like we're the only ones who want Bishop alive.
[3339.35s -> 3341.35s]  I have a good mind just to let him go work
[3341.35s -> 3343.35s]  on the son of a bitch.
[3343.35s -> 3345.35s]  I'm about done putting my life on the line to protect
[3345.35s -> 3347.35s]  some child molester.
[3347.35s -> 3349.35s]  That's our job, unfortunately.
[3349.35s -> 3351.35s]  They don't get to dole out the justice.
[3351.35s -> 3364.34s]  Well, alright.
[3364.34s -> 3367.86s]  So I think I'm understanding.
[3367.86s -> 3369.86s]  Go investigate
[3369.86s -> 3371.86s]  guy's sick fucking
[3371.86s -> 3375.83s]  perverted place.
[3375.83s -> 3377.83s]  Do you have a photograph of me and him?
[3377.83s -> 3379.83s]  Yes.
[3379.83s -> 3410.74s]  Okay, that's it. Bye.
[3410.74s -> 3412.74s]  You need evidence.
[3412.74s -> 3414.74s]  Yeah, but that whole fucking house was an
[3414.74s -> 3416.74s]  giant ball of evidence.
[3416.74s -> 3420.90s]  That guy was standing essentially
[3420.90s -> 3422.90s]  at the scene of the murder.
[3422.90s -> 3424.90s]  With blood all over his body.
[3424.90s -> 3426.90s]  And three screaming people.
[3426.90s -> 3428.90s]  Dead and screaming, dying.
[3428.90s -> 3430.90s]  Mark Bishop, stop! LAPD!
[3430.90s -> 3447.67s]  He's not very fast, either.
[3447.67s -> 3455.74s]  We're trying to help you, Bishop.
[3455.74s -> 3461.48s]  Thank you.
[3461.48s -> 3466.73s]  He's a mad hatter.
[3466.73s -> 3468.73s]  He takes an uphill.
[3468.73s -> 3470.73s]  That was the mistake, you're right.
[3470.73s -> 3478.60s]  It's us or McAfee's boys.
[3478.60s -> 3482.70s]  Your choice.
[3482.70s -> 3486.28s]  You didn't do anything. Wait, come here.
[3486.28s -> 3488.28s]  I have a photograph I want to show you.
[3488.28s -> 3501.19s]  Hey.
[3501.19s -> 3505.03s]  Bishop, that's enough.
[3505.03s -> 3507.03s]  I have a letter from your mother. She's worried sick.
[3507.03s -> 3516.06s]  Yeah, that's right. Now you stay
[3516.06s -> 3518.06s]  right there. And what's this check made
[3518.06s -> 3520.06s]  out to you, sir?
[3520.06s -> 3536.94s]  Shit!
[3536.94s -> 3538.94s]  Mark Bishop, stop! LAPD!
[3538.94s -> 3540.94s]  I didn't know that was possible.
[3540.94s -> 3542.94s]  I thought it was just a run of...
[3542.94s -> 3544.94s]  I didn't know it was possible.
[3544.94s -> 3554.54s]  Plus, I'm reading chat
[3554.54s -> 3556.54s]  during this run behind the guy.
[3556.54s -> 3561.27s]  Sorry.
[3561.27s -> 3564.41s]  We're trying to help you, Bishop.
[3564.41s -> 3581.69s]  Thank you.
[3581.69s -> 3583.69s]  It's us or McAfee's boys.
[3583.69s -> 3589.32s]  Your choice.
[3589.32s -> 3595.21s]  We both did the same thing.
[3595.21s -> 3597.21s]  We both learned how to jump from the same
[3597.21s -> 3602.39s]  sensei, apparently.
[3602.39s -> 3604.39s]  Move another inch and you're dead.
[3604.39s -> 3606.39s]  Dead? Bishop, that's enough.
[3606.39s -> 3609.85s]  Bishop, you're under
[3609.85s -> 3611.85s]  arrest for the attempted murder of June Ballard
[3611.85s -> 3613.85s]  and the rape and attempted murder
[3613.85s -> 3616.54s]  of Jessica Hamilton.
[3616.54s -> 3618.54s]  All right, I'll come quietly. Just don't
[3618.54s -> 3620.78s]  kill me. If you found
[3620.78s -> 3622.78s]  me, then McAfee's goons will too.
[3622.78s -> 3625.66s]  We need to get out of here.
[3625.66s -> 3630.26s]  You stay close. Any tricks
[3630.26s -> 3632.26s]  and I'll save McAfee's boys the trouble.
[3632.26s -> 3634.26s]  Follow me. I know another way
[3634.26s -> 3636.26s]  to get out of this place.
[3636.26s -> 3643.69s]  I was going to make an elaborate
[3643.69s -> 3645.69s]  place. Christ detective,
[3645.69s -> 3647.69s]  they're trying to kill me.
[3647.69s -> 3649.69s]  How to stop the McAfee boys. Last chance to back
[3649.69s -> 3651.69s]  the hell down. Install a program that
[3651.69s -> 3653.99s]  uses the internet.
[3653.99s -> 3655.99s]  It'll break everything.
[3655.99s -> 3660.79s]  They won't know what to do.
[3660.79s -> 3665.98s]  This way. R2, I forgot.
[3665.98s -> 3667.98s]  McAfee doesn't make the rules.
[3667.98s -> 3669.98s]  You hear me?
[3669.98s -> 3671.98s]  Kill them for god's sake.
[3671.98s -> 3675.11s]  I don't want to die.
[3675.11s -> 3677.11s]  Pop it up.
[3677.11s -> 3680.76s]  Shoot the barrels to the stroll of the wall.
[3682.76s -> 3684.76s]  Fire away.
[3686.76s -> 3688.76s]  No, I'm not very good at this.
[3688.76s -> 3692.66s]  I'm not very good at this.
[3713.50s -> 3718.30s]  Am I not hit?
[3718.30s -> 3720.30s]  What is going on right now?
[3720.30s -> 3725.10s]  What the fuck is happening?
[3725.10s -> 3727.10s]  Do I need a different weapon?
[3727.10s -> 3729.10s]  Do I need an X to pick up weapons?
[3729.10s -> 3732.17s]  Am I too far away to shoot
[3732.17s -> 3738.18s]  these guys?
[3738.18s -> 3740.18s]  Why is it going down?
[3740.18s -> 3746.84s]  Okay, honest to god.
[3750.81s -> 3752.81s]  Okay, very finally. Now I'm out of
[3752.81s -> 3756.14s]  range.
[3756.14s -> 3764.52s]  Just curve the bullets.
[3764.52s -> 3768.23s]  This should be death.
[3768.23s -> 3770.73s]  I pressed
[3770.73s -> 3772.73s]  X on it. It didn't do anything.
[3772.73s -> 3774.73s]  I saw pick up weapons like three times.
[3774.73s -> 3779.98s]  I pressed X.
[3779.98s -> 3781.98s]  Okay, now I have it.
[3784.92s -> 3786.92s]  Weird.
[3786.92s -> 3788.92s]  Why would you do that? Get out of there.
[3801.40s -> 3810.42s]  I'm being a bad teammate.
[3821.75s -> 3825.34s]  Where the hell was he before?
[3825.34s -> 3827.34s]  Was he waiting for me to kill things before?
[3840.52s -> 3842.52s]  All the Red Dead Redemption 2 aiming
[3842.52s -> 3844.52s]  hasn't paid off?
[3844.52s -> 3846.52s]  I got news for you.
[3846.52s -> 3848.52s]  It doesn't matter how much
[3848.52s -> 3850.52s]  you train in console aiming.
[3850.52s -> 3852.52s]  It either auto-targets
[3852.52s -> 3854.52s]  or you have an eye closed.
[3854.52s -> 3856.52s]  That's just kind of how it works.
[3856.52s -> 3863.80s]  What are you doing?
[3863.80s -> 3888.74s]  What are you doing? Get off.
[3891.37s -> 3906.47s]  Hurry!
[3906.47s -> 3909.03s]  Convenient explosive barrels.
[3909.03s -> 3912.23s]  Pick up weapons.
[3912.23s -> 3919.27s]  Should I pick it up?
[3919.27s -> 3921.27s]  I'll try it.
[3927.80s -> 3929.80s]  That's not the people I should be shooting at.
[3929.80s -> 3932.10s]  Those are our officers.
[3932.10s -> 3942.34s]  Stay in cover.
[3942.34s -> 3946.70s]  You guys through the window?
[3946.70s -> 3953.59s]  It is just one guy left.
[3953.59s -> 3963.19s]  Who is left?
[3963.19s -> 3965.19s]  This is what I call a result.
[3965.19s -> 3967.19s]  Mark Bishop,
[3967.19s -> 3969.19s]  first wild film producer,
[3969.19s -> 3971.19s]  an all-around piece of shit,
[3971.19s -> 3973.19s]  catches a fast ticket to Quentin
[3973.19s -> 3975.19s]  for stach rape and attempted murder.
[3975.19s -> 3977.19s]  So he gets to spend the next 15 years
[3977.19s -> 3979.19s]  playing...
[3979.19s -> 3983.19s]  That is just capital J, Detective Phelps.
[3983.19s -> 3985.43s]  You don't have such a reputation.
[3985.43s -> 3987.43s]  I'm not going to be able to hold on to you any longer.
[3987.43s -> 3989.43s]  You're getting promoted.
[3989.43s -> 3991.43s]  Go on, get your new assignment.
[3991.43s -> 3993.43s]  It was good work.
[3993.43s -> 3998.55s]  Welcome, welcome everybody.
[3998.55s -> 4021.51s]  Lights on.
[4021.51s -> 4023.51s]  Phelps, Bukowski. This your work?
[4023.51s -> 4025.51s]  Can I help you, Detective?
[4025.51s -> 4027.51s]  My lights are all fucked up.
[4027.51s -> 4029.51s]  Yeah, I'll bet you did.
[4029.51s -> 4031.51s]  This is a traffic case. You need something?
[4031.51s -> 4033.51s]  I'm here to buy a drink
[4033.51s -> 4035.51s]  for the two LAPD traffic cops
[4035.51s -> 4037.51s]  who broke the back of Guy McCaffey's private army.
[4037.51s -> 4039.51s]  You don't have a problem with that, do you, Captain?
[4041.51s -> 4043.75s]  Go right ahead.
[4043.75s -> 4045.75s]  Get in. I'm buying.
[4045.75s -> 4064.18s]  I like this place.
[4064.18s -> 4066.18s]  A lot of movie people hang out here.
[4066.18s -> 4068.18s]  You like jazz, Cole? The hopheads love it.
[4068.18s -> 4070.18s]  Sure, I guess.
[4070.18s -> 4072.18s]  Big bands and swing, I can understand,
[4072.18s -> 4074.18s]  but this bebop palaver?
[4074.18s -> 4079.11s]  How are you supposed to dance to that?
[4079.11s -> 4081.11s]  What helps, Leroy? Be nice to them.
[4081.11s -> 4083.11s]  You'll like this place.
[4083.11s -> 4087.21s]  They treat you right.
[4087.21s -> 4089.21s]  You like a table, Leroy?
[4089.21s -> 4091.21s]  What do you think we want to do? Stand at the bar like chumps?
[4091.21s -> 4093.21s]  I'll get a table ready for you.
[4093.21s -> 4095.21s]  Don't look so happy to see me, Alphonse.
[4095.21s -> 4097.21s]  I might get the wrong impression.
[4097.21s -> 4099.21s]  Cole, this is Alphonse.
[4099.21s -> 4101.21s]  He's a French negro from Africa. Can you beat that?
[4101.21s -> 4103.21s]  The Congo.
[4103.21s -> 4105.21s]  A pleasure to meet you, Alphonse.
[4105.21s -> 4107.21s]  Come on, Cole, you can meet Elsa
[4107.21s -> 4109.21s]  while they're fixing us a table.
[4109.21s -> 4111.51s]  I like her. She's something else.
[4111.51s -> 4113.51s]  Maybe another night, Roy.
[4113.51s -> 4115.51s]  She's pretty beat up about it.
[4115.51s -> 4117.51s]  Get your hands off me.
[4117.51s -> 4119.51s]  Don't ever tell me what to do or what not to do, Alphonse.
[4121.51s -> 4123.51s]  You got a nice club here.
[4123.51s -> 4125.51s]  Don't spoil it.
[4125.51s -> 4128.71s]  If you will follow me, detectives,
[4128.71s -> 4133.70s]  just through the door.
[4133.70s -> 4135.70s]  He was my only real friend, Harlan.
[4135.70s -> 4137.70s]  We went through it all.
[4137.70s -> 4140.14s]  Do you realize what he meant to me?
[4140.14s -> 4142.14s]  Of course I do.
[4142.14s -> 4144.14s]  You said it was construction work.
[4144.14s -> 4146.14s]  It was an industrial accident, Elsa.
[4146.14s -> 4148.14s]  How can I be held responsible?
[4148.14s -> 4150.14s]  Elsa, are you going on?
[4150.14s -> 4152.14s]  Louis, for God's sake,
[4152.14s -> 4154.14s]  he was my best friend.
[4154.14s -> 4156.14s]  The only man who ever loved me
[4156.14s -> 4158.14s]  without putting his hands on me.
[4158.14s -> 4160.14s]  Hi, Elsa.
[4160.14s -> 4162.14s]  Here's someone I'd like you to meet.
[4162.14s -> 4164.14s]  Cole Phelps, war hero and
[4164.14s -> 4166.14s]  crime fighter extraordinaire.
[4166.14s -> 4168.14s]  Why would I want to meet another
[4168.14s -> 4170.14s]  fascist from the LAPD?
[4170.14s -> 4172.82s]  Sorry about this, Cole.
[4172.82s -> 4174.82s]  What an evening I'm having.
[4174.82s -> 4176.82s]  First a negro puts his hands on me
[4176.82s -> 4178.82s]  and then this.
[4178.82s -> 4180.82s]  Who do you think you're talking to,
[4180.82s -> 4182.82s]  you German junkie whore?
[4182.82s -> 4184.82s]  I told you, this guy sucks.
[4184.82s -> 4186.82s]  Do you hear me?
[4186.82s -> 4189.96s]  Evening, Doc. How's business?
[4189.96s -> 4191.96s]  Sanguine.
[4191.96s -> 4194.20s]  Louis, help me here.
[4194.20s -> 4196.20s]  I'm gonna have to give her
[4196.20s -> 4198.20s]  something before her performance.
[4198.20s -> 4200.20s]  Blow it off, Cole. These artsy-fartsy
[4200.20s -> 4202.20s]  types always get a little flighty.
[4202.20s -> 4204.20s]  Meet Dr. Harlan Fontaine,
[4204.20s -> 4206.20s]  doctor to the stars.
[4206.20s -> 4208.20s]  Mr. Fix-It to the mental wreckage
[4208.20s -> 4210.20s]  of Hollywood.
[4210.20s -> 4213.66s]  So what about
[4213.66s -> 4215.66s]  that drink, boys?
[4215.66s -> 4241.24s]  Alright. Case closed.
[4241.24s -> 4245.98s]  13.
[4245.98s -> 4250.01s]  Not great.
[4250.01s -> 4262.42s]  It gets raided, says nothing.
[4262.42s -> 4264.42s]  What? I just talked about it for like a full minute.
[4264.42s -> 4282.02s]  Only a minute?
[4282.02s -> 4297.83s]  Right, gentlemen, take your seats.
[4297.83s -> 4300.26s]  Let's get this over before lunch.
[4300.26s -> 4302.63s]  Clyde Rose of the
[4302.63s -> 4304.63s]  homicide squad has decided to take care
[4304.63s -> 4306.63s]  of the retirement. Sounds good.
[4306.63s -> 4308.63s]  We will all miss Floyd on the steely edge
[4308.63s -> 4310.63s]  he brought to his police work.
[4310.63s -> 4312.63s]  The department has arranged a weed
[4312.63s -> 4314.63s]  drink at the Galway Arms to quench the mighty
[4314.63s -> 4316.63s]  thirst a man gets from
[4316.63s -> 4318.63s]  25 years of police work.
[4318.63s -> 4322.09s]  Floyd's departure
[4322.09s -> 4324.09s]  leaves a place at the top table.
[4324.09s -> 4326.09s]  And the chief is seen fit to promote
[4326.09s -> 4328.09s]  coal felt from burglary to the
[4328.09s -> 4330.09s]  homicide desk.
[4330.09s -> 4332.09s]  Stand up, Phelps. Take a chair.
[4332.09s -> 4335.80s]  You're in the major leagues now,
[4335.80s -> 4338.10s]  Sonny. Rusty Galway,
[4338.10s -> 4340.10s]  a fine lawman of the old school, will be
[4340.10s -> 4344.26s]  taking you under his wing.
[4344.26s -> 4346.26s]  Your first case is the murder of a woman
[4346.26s -> 4348.26s]  found last night and bearing all the
[4348.26s -> 4350.26s]  signs of the werewolf.
[4350.26s -> 4359.16s]  Get out to the scene, lads.
[4359.16s -> 4361.59s]  Okay. The streets of LA
[4361.59s -> 4363.59s]  line you to patrol the city and attend street crimes.
[4363.59s -> 4365.59s]  Each desk off is a new set of street
[4365.59s -> 4369.11s]  crimes. Okay.
[4369.11s -> 4371.11s]  Do you have the address?
[4371.11s -> 4373.11s]  It's been all over KGPL.
[4373.11s -> 4375.35s]  It's off Temple Street
[4375.35s -> 4377.35s]  between Belmont and Glendale.
[4377.35s -> 4380.23s]  Get the sensor bar ready,
[4380.23s -> 4382.23s]  Galway. Are we about to see...
[4382.23s -> 4384.23s]  I mean, I have a giant one that's ready, so...
[4384.23s -> 4388.01s]  Oh, there's an oxymoron for you.
[4388.01s -> 4393.00s]  I'd rather you took the wheel.
[4403.37s -> 4405.74s]  Ow.
[4405.74s -> 4411.30s]  All right, let's go.
[4411.30s -> 4413.30s]  What happened to Rose? Parker lost the chief's job.
[4413.30s -> 4415.30s]  The word is the chief is going to be hammered
[4415.30s -> 4417.30s]  until they're both clearing the desk.
[4417.30s -> 4419.30s]  Where does that leave you, Galway?
[4419.30s -> 4421.30s]  We got a call. Hold on.
[4421.30s -> 4423.30s]  Please me saddle with a chump like you, Phelps.
[4423.30s -> 4425.30s]  I didn't ask for you, and I don't want you,
[4425.30s -> 4427.30s]  so keep it to yourself.
[4427.30s -> 4429.30s]  See if you can learn something about
[4429.30s -> 4431.74s]  real cops.
[4431.74s -> 4433.74s]  What did he mean by the werewolf?
[4433.74s -> 4435.74s]  A dahlia. The daily news
[4435.74s -> 4437.74s]  came out calling him the werewolf killer.
[4437.74s -> 4439.74s]  The examiner came up with the black dahlia.
[4439.74s -> 4441.74s]  Were we any closer to catching him?
[4441.74s -> 4443.74s]  Not a chance.
[4443.74s -> 4445.74s]  It's been months and hundreds of guys running down leagues
[4445.74s -> 4447.74s]  and we got nothing.
[4447.74s -> 4449.74s]  You don't think this has anything? Why would you...
[4449.74s -> 4452.49s]  Don't do that. No, I don't.
[4452.49s -> 4454.49s]  3% of murders are domestic, Phelps.
[4454.49s -> 4456.49s]  Some guy gets into a beef with his wife, he takes it too far.
[4456.49s -> 4458.49s]  This would be the same.
[4458.49s -> 4460.49s]  But, cutting someone in half...
[4460.49s -> 4462.49s]  This is very far away.
[4462.49s -> 4464.49s]  This is a very far away crime that happened over here.
[4464.49s -> 4466.49s]  This is a war.
[4466.49s -> 4472.38s]  All right, what's it do?
[4474.62s -> 4481.27s]  A possible jumper?
[4481.27s -> 4483.83s]  You need to get up there.
[4483.83s -> 4485.83s]  Let me do the talking detective.
[4485.83s -> 4487.83s]  I know a ton of this psychology stuff.
[4487.83s -> 4489.83s]  Take the back alley and find a way up there.
[4489.83s -> 4492.65s]  I don't trust this guy.
[4492.65s -> 4494.65s]  Come on, Phelps, let's get moving.
[4494.65s -> 4497.66s]  Are you jumping?
[4497.66s -> 4500.76s]  Get sure you warn me where you do.
[4500.76s -> 4502.76s]  All right, so I gotta get up there and I gotta prevent him from jumping.
[4502.76s -> 4509.99s]  I don't know why for a second, I thought he was gonna kick me.
[4509.99s -> 4511.99s]  I'll bring you down with me, Phelps.
[4511.99s -> 4527.54s]  Should we not be sprinting at him like this?
[4527.54s -> 4530.49s]  Are you crazy?
[4530.49s -> 4532.49s]  What are you trying to do?
[4532.49s -> 4539.98s]  He's not just gonna do it, right?
[4539.98s -> 4541.98s]  Should I not have spread it up there?
[4541.98s -> 4543.98s]  Like, as fast as I can?
[4543.98s -> 4546.22s]  Is this what you wanted?
[4546.22s -> 4549.35s]  I can't do it.
[4549.35s -> 4551.72s]  I'll come quietly.
[4551.72s -> 4554.73s]  I need some help.
[4554.73s -> 4556.73s]  Please, you gotta get me some help.
[4556.73s -> 4560.06s]  I made it.
[4560.06s -> 4564.66s]  You're a danger to yourself and to others.
[4564.66s -> 4568.12s]  Why is everybody cheering?
[4568.12s -> 4571.83s]  I just gave like that.
[4571.83s -> 4573.83s]  That's right, everybody down there in my audience.
[4573.83s -> 4593.93s]  Let's do it.
[4593.93s -> 4607.56s]  Back to work we go.
[4607.56s -> 4609.56s]  Back to going the streets.
[4609.56s -> 4613.40s]  How many chapters have I completed?
[4613.40s -> 4616.41s]  Um...
[4616.41s -> 4618.41s]  I think this is case 10.
[4618.41s -> 4620.90s]  Or this would be case 10.
[4620.90s -> 4622.90s]  Coming up.
[4622.90s -> 4625.77s]  I think this is the second chapter.
[4625.77s -> 4629.10s]  I assume.
[4629.10s -> 4631.10s]  No engine sound for some reason.
[4631.10s -> 4633.66s]  I don't know why.
[4633.66s -> 4644.90s]  Not a scratch, I got it.
[4644.90s -> 4659.50s]  Hybrid car.
[4659.50s -> 4661.50s]  I feel like we should be in a different video game.
[4661.50s -> 4663.50s]  This music.
[4663.50s -> 4665.50s]  No engine sounds.
[4665.50s -> 4668.57s]  I feel like I should be searching for hidden objects.
[4668.57s -> 4670.57s]  I don't know why.
[4670.57s -> 4672.57s]  That's what I think of.
[4672.57s -> 4687.29s]  Give me a break.
[4687.29s -> 4689.29s]  I'll take it.
[4689.29s -> 4691.29s]  Bank of America?
[4691.29s -> 4700.70s]  Alright, let's go.
[4700.70s -> 4702.70s]  I want to do like all these.
[4702.70s -> 4716.84s]  I want to match the pre-game.
[4716.84s -> 4718.84s]  That's what I think of.
[4718.84s -> 4722.87s]  I want to just match the pre-game sounds.
[4722.87s -> 4724.87s]  Like.
[4724.87s -> 4727.56s]  Cool.
[4727.56s -> 4730.12s]  Excellent.
[4730.12s -> 4740.79s]  Oh my god.
[4740.79s -> 4742.79s]  Slow and steady.
[4742.79s -> 4745.03s]  Come on.
[4745.03s -> 4747.03s]  It's not like I'm driving on the wrong side of the road or anything.
[4747.03s -> 4761.94s]  You know when people are in jeeps?
[4761.94s -> 4763.94s]  And they beep at each other.
[4763.94s -> 4766.44s]  This car is done.
[4766.44s -> 4768.44s]  This car is done.
[4768.44s -> 4770.44s]  Did anybody else hear the actual siren that drove by the house?
[4770.44s -> 4774.09s]  I don't know.
[4774.09s -> 4777.99s]  I don't know.
[4777.99s -> 4779.99s]  Did anybody else hear the actual siren that drove by the house?
[4779.99s -> 4789.19s]  I did.
[4789.19s -> 4791.19s]  Out of the car. Police.
[4791.19s -> 4803.29s]  You can't do this.
[4803.29s -> 4805.29s]  Does this one have engine sounds?
[4805.29s -> 4812.38s]  Kind of.
[4812.38s -> 4814.38s]  This is GTA now.
[4814.38s -> 4820.84s]  Can you do that?
[4820.84s -> 4822.84s]  FBI.
[4822.84s -> 4824.84s]  I'm taking the car.
[4824.84s -> 4828.68s]  You can?
[4828.68s -> 4830.68s]  I don't know if I would believe that person.
[4830.68s -> 4832.68s]  You know what I'm saying?
[4832.68s -> 4834.68s]  You could go get a fake badge from the party store.
[4834.68s -> 4836.68s]  You need your car.
[4836.68s -> 4848.58s]  What?
[4848.58s -> 4850.58s]  What's the situation?
[4850.58s -> 4852.58s]  Half a dozen shooters, sir. Cold blooded sons of bitches.
[4852.58s -> 4854.58s]  Real professionals.
[4854.58s -> 4856.58s]  What do you mean?
[4856.58s -> 4858.58s]  Witnesses say they bounced in, aced the guards, and went straight downstairs.
[4858.58s -> 4860.58s]  Christ knows who they're working for.
[4860.58s -> 4862.58s]  But whatever's in that vault, they want it bad.
[4862.58s -> 4874.41s]  They also shot at us.
[4874.41s -> 4876.41s]  I got an achievement made out of wood.
[4876.41s -> 4878.41s]  I got an achievement made out of wood.
[4878.41s -> 4905.27s]  Get off of this, please.
[4905.27s -> 4907.27s]  I sometimes just feel like my character is a fucking magnet.
[4907.27s -> 4911.43s]  And I'm running through a depolar field.
[4911.43s -> 4913.43s]  And I'm running through a depolar field.
[4913.43s -> 4915.43s]  Take the elevator.
[4915.43s -> 4917.43s]  Alright, I'll wait here.
[4917.43s -> 4920.70s]  Don't give them a chance to regroup.
[4920.70s -> 4922.87s]  Wish me luck.
[4926.14s -> 4932.09s]  If this were real life right now, I'd be going,
[4932.09s -> 4934.09s]  Fuck! Fuck!
[4934.09s -> 4936.09s]  Okay, fuck! Okay!
[4936.09s -> 4938.09s]  Okay, here we go!
[4938.09s -> 4940.09s]  That leaves you, pal.
[4940.09s -> 4949.50s]  In the vault.
[4949.50s -> 4954.42s]  Oh, what's taking so long?
[4954.42s -> 4964.09s]  And where the hell are you?
[4964.09s -> 4970.10s]  He's like, standing behind the car.
[4970.10s -> 4973.30s]  He's like, standing behind the car.
[4973.30s -> 4975.30s]  You can't live to tell the tale.
[4975.30s -> 4986.04s]  That's it.
[4986.04s -> 4988.28s]  That's all of them.
[4988.28s -> 4994.30s]  Let him live?
[4994.30s -> 4998.50s]  He had his opportunity.
[4998.50s -> 5000.50s]  Reload loudly in front of him.
[5000.50s -> 5002.50s]  Reload loudly in front of him.
[5002.50s -> 5006.09s]  Car 11K.
[5006.09s -> 5008.09s]  Shots fired, suspects are down.
[5008.09s -> 5010.09s]  We're code four here, but I need an ambulance at Bank of America.
[5010.09s -> 5012.09s]  Seventh and olive.
[5012.09s -> 5014.09s]  Identify coroner and detective headquarters.
[5014.09s -> 5016.39s]  Identify coroner and detective headquarters.
[5016.39s -> 5028.10s]  Okay, you ready to solve a mystery?
[5028.10s -> 5038.41s]  What is this fucking music?
[5038.41s -> 5040.41s]  What is this?
[5040.41s -> 5042.41s]  What is this?
[5042.41s -> 5046.44s]  Everybody's listening to the same song.
[5046.44s -> 5055.14s]  Either that, or this is the intro
[5055.14s -> 5057.83s]  Either that, or this is the intro
[5057.83s -> 5059.83s]  to a British television mystery show.
[5059.83s -> 5063.10s]  This is where the credits show up.
[5063.10s -> 5066.62s]  Calm down!
[5066.62s -> 5068.62s]  And Arthur Bradbury as
[5068.62s -> 5091.85s]  Detective Doohickey.
[5091.85s -> 5093.85s]  Gotta play some hidden object games now.
[5093.85s -> 5102.17s]  I was thinking about it.
[5102.17s -> 5105.69s]  Oh my god.
[5105.69s -> 5107.69s]  This is more side tracking than in Red Dead.
[5107.69s -> 5113.38s]  And I have to do it though,
[5113.38s -> 5115.38s]  because these are all interesting.
[5115.38s -> 5117.38s]  Oh, I almost bulled that guy.
[5117.38s -> 5127.56s]  Do the murder investigation.
[5127.56s -> 5129.56s]  What about these murder investigations?
[5129.56s -> 5132.44s]  Bank of America.
[5132.44s -> 5134.87s]  Guy jumping off the building.
[5134.87s -> 5138.39s]  I need to do these too.
[5138.39s -> 5143.38s]  How is this stalling?
[5143.38s -> 5145.38s]  I'm playing the game!
[5145.38s -> 5147.38s]  Stalling would be this!
[5147.38s -> 5152.30s]  Hey, um...
[5152.30s -> 5154.30s]  Does anybody know...
[5154.30s -> 5156.30s]  Does anybody know what time Evo starts?
[5156.30s -> 5160.52s]  Uh...
[5160.52s -> 5162.52s]  It's like next month, right?
[5162.52s -> 5165.21s]  That's stalling!
[5165.21s -> 5167.70s]  I'm playing...
[5167.70s -> 5178.52s]  What am I doing?
[5178.52s -> 5180.52s]  How can you be stalling if you're playing
[5180.52s -> 5182.52s]  the content in the game that you're playing?
[5182.52s -> 5186.68s]  Maybe if I turned on the webcam?
[5186.68s -> 5188.68s]  Maybe if I turned on the webcam?
[5188.68s -> 5190.68s]  There's always a cop
[5190.68s -> 5192.68s]  that's just Kenny from South Park.
[5192.68s -> 5194.68s]  He dies instantly.
[5205.88s -> 5219.24s]  Give it up!
[5219.24s -> 5221.24s]  I can't scare him? He's not a horse.
[5221.24s -> 5224.82s]  I'm not trying to kill him.
[5224.82s -> 5226.82s]  I'm trying to scare him so he goes...
[5226.82s -> 5235.08s]  How did he get up there? A ladder.
[5235.08s -> 5238.66s]  Perfect. I'm not trying to shoot him.
[5238.66s -> 5240.66s]  I'm trying to make him freak out.
[5240.66s -> 5245.08s]  Oh, he's so fucking far away though.
[5245.08s -> 5247.08s]  I'm gonna have to shoot him.
[5247.08s -> 5251.99s]  All right, now stop. Give up.
[5251.99s -> 5256.66s]  I'm trying to shoot him like defeat.
[5256.66s -> 5258.84s]  I'm trying to shoot him like defeat.
[5260.84s -> 5265.82s]  Stop it!
[5265.82s -> 5280.15s]  All right, got him.
[5280.15s -> 5285.66s]  All right, you're going to jail.
[5296.38s -> 5298.38s]  See? I didn't use any force there.
[5298.38s -> 5300.38s]  Everybody that
[5300.38s -> 5302.38s]  likes to make fun of me for...
[5302.38s -> 5304.38s]  Oh, Djerba just shot him in the head.
[5304.38s -> 5308.22s]  But I need to find
[5308.22s -> 5323.06s]  those mystery coins.
[5323.06s -> 5325.06s]  I didn't kill him. What do you mean I killed him?
[5325.06s -> 5327.62s]  He's just gonna be missing a few toes.
[5327.62s -> 5340.30s]  4 means dead.
[5340.30s -> 5351.29s]  No, it doesn't.
[5351.29s -> 5354.87s]  No, what? Yes, it does.
[5354.87s -> 5356.87s]  Connect 4 means you won the fucking round
[5356.87s -> 5358.87s]  and you go on to play the next one.
[5358.87s -> 5360.87s]  He's fine. He just had a couple of bruises.
[5360.87s -> 5365.86s]  I don't know the
[5365.86s -> 5367.86s]  police numbers. I don't know the police numbers!
[5367.86s -> 5374.39s]  They just make him up.
[5374.39s -> 5376.39s]  That's not real.
[5376.39s -> 5378.76s]  That's just like a police movie
[5378.76s -> 5380.76s]  TV show thing. We've got a code
[5380.76s -> 5382.76s]  141-2652 at
[5382.76s -> 5384.76s]  South Point 4 Boulevard.
[5384.76s -> 5386.76s]  It's all just, it's like saying
[5386.76s -> 5388.76s]  555-5555 for a telephone number.
[5388.76s -> 5406.81s]  Oh, get the sensor ready!
[5406.81s -> 5408.81s]  I got a haircut.
[5423.30s -> 5425.30s]  He's good, Rusty.
[5425.30s -> 5427.30s]  He even sounds genuine.
[5427.30s -> 5429.30s]  That's Phelps, guys. The war hero.
[5429.30s -> 5431.30s]  Defending the honor of murdered humps.
[5431.30s -> 5433.30s]  It's the same face.
[5433.30s -> 5435.30s]  They're used to it, Phelps.
[5435.30s -> 5437.30s]  Moving along, guys. You got your pictures, you got your headlines.
[5437.30s -> 5439.30s]  Now scram.
[5439.30s -> 5451.45s]  Screeks. Tree.
[5451.45s -> 5455.74s]  Body.
[5455.74s -> 5468.15s]  Oh. Trollman, this your beat?
[5468.15s -> 5470.15s]  Yes, sir. Well, part of it.
[5470.15s -> 5472.15s]  Kids park here, they use it like a
[5472.15s -> 5474.15s]  lover's lane. It's a
[5474.15s -> 5476.15s]  neighborhood. Some trouble, but
[5476.15s -> 5478.78s]  nothing like this.
[5478.78s -> 5481.59s]  It's known locally as the Morse.
[5481.59s -> 5483.59s]  You were first on the scene? Yes, detective.
[5483.59s -> 5485.59s]  No one's disturbed the body?
[5485.59s -> 5487.59s]  No, sir. We cleared out
[5487.59s -> 5489.59s]  them vulture reporters so Pinker in the corner could work.
[5489.59s -> 5491.59s]  They're waiting to talk to you.
[5491.59s -> 5493.59s]  Go house to house and see what you come up with.
[5493.59s -> 5497.56s]  This ain't gonna work. Too bad.
[5497.56s -> 5501.85s]  Hold on.
[5501.85s -> 5510.62s]  It's not gonna work.
[5510.62s -> 5512.79s]  It's not gonna work, guys.
[5512.79s -> 5514.79s]  This is an adult
[5514.79s -> 5516.79s]  part of the stream.
[5516.79s -> 5518.79s]  If you're not at least
[5518.79s -> 5520.79s]  allowed to go to an R-rated
[5520.79s -> 5522.79s]  movie, then you're not
[5522.79s -> 5534.70s]  you gotta get out of here. Cause of death?
[5534.70s -> 5537.13s]  Could be the head injuries.
[5537.13s -> 5539.13s]  She hasn't been badly stalled.
[5539.13s -> 5541.62s]  The cuts look superficial.
[5541.62s -> 5552.31s]  I'll know for sure in an hour.
[5552.31s -> 5554.31s]  What caused the blunt force injury to the face?
[5554.31s -> 5556.31s]  Could be anything from a
[5556.31s -> 5558.31s]  baseball bat to a lug wrench.
[5558.31s -> 5560.31s]  I'll have more details after the autopsy.
[5560.31s -> 5562.31s]  So you're allowed to go to an R-rated
[5562.31s -> 5564.31s]  movie if your parents let you.
[5564.31s -> 5566.31s]  Yeah, but your parents need to be
[5566.31s -> 5568.31s]  watching the stream with you.
[5568.31s -> 5570.31s]  You can't prove that to me.
[5570.31s -> 5588.81s]  Am I gonna get in fucking trouble
[5588.81s -> 5595.91s]  for this shit? I don't know.
[5595.91s -> 5609.02s]  Hmm. Interesting.
[5609.02s -> 5619.18s]  Okay. Anything else?
[5619.18s -> 5622.06s]  It's not gonna work.
[5622.06s -> 5626.34s]  What about this wound on the
[5626.34s -> 5628.34s]  bite mark? Something removed.
[5628.34s -> 5630.34s]  A ring, most likely. I assume it was
[5630.34s -> 5632.34s]  taken post-mortem. Missing ring?
[5632.34s -> 5647.75s]  Okay. I don't know!
[5647.75s -> 5649.75s]  I don't know what to do!
[5649.75s -> 5654.87s]  Whatever. If you're not at least
[5654.87s -> 5656.87s]  17 with the parent's permission,
[5656.87s -> 5659.94s]  you're not allowed to watch the stream at this point forward.
[5659.94s -> 5662.63s]  That goes for all of you. 18?
[5662.63s -> 5665.75s]  You're not allowed to be here.
[5665.75s -> 5677.27s]  Unless your mother told you it was okay.
[5677.27s -> 5679.27s]  In fact, no.
[5679.27s -> 5681.27s]  You're not even allowed to be here.
[5681.27s -> 5683.51s]  Even if your mother says it's okay, you're not supposed to be here.
[5683.51s -> 5695.61s]  You understand? Okay, I got it.
[5706.55s -> 5708.55s]  Either way, I'll run tests on the lipstick.
[5708.55s -> 5710.55s]  Any idea of the time of death?
[5710.55s -> 5712.55s]  From the temperature, I'd say after midnight.
[5712.55s -> 5714.55s]  I'll confirm with you later.
[5714.55s -> 5718.52s]  Oh!
[5718.52s -> 5720.95s]  Oh my god!
[5720.95s -> 5723.32s]  I thought that was...
[5723.32s -> 5731.06s]  What can you tell me about the shoe prints?
[5731.06s -> 5733.56s]  Men's size 8.
[5733.56s -> 5735.56s]  Pinker lifted impressions for me to
[5735.56s -> 5737.99s]  compare back at the lab.
[5737.99s -> 5741.00s]  Size 8. Men's size 8.
[5741.00s -> 5743.00s]  And one of them has bird shit all over it.
[5743.00s -> 5761.29s]  Look at a globe?
[5761.29s -> 5763.29s]  Looks like some kind of puzzle or parlor game.
[5763.29s -> 5767.64s]  It opens up and there's going to be
[5767.64s -> 5769.64s]  chocolate inside.
[5769.64s -> 5781.85s]  Okay, okay.
[5781.85s -> 5784.47s]  See, that's
[5784.47s -> 5786.47s]  the top half of North America
[5786.47s -> 5788.47s]  and this is the bottom half of North America.
[5788.47s -> 5791.99s]  Okay.
[5791.99s -> 5794.49s]  Like that.
[5794.49s -> 5796.49s]  There's a couple islands in between.
[5796.49s -> 5798.49s]  No, not quite. Maybe a little bit more.
[5798.49s -> 5802.90s]  There we go. Okay.
[5802.90s -> 5813.72s]  There it is. Alright, now I actually
[5813.72s -> 5815.72s]  fucked it up, so hold on.
[5815.72s -> 5820.01s]  It looks like this.
[5820.01s -> 5822.01s]  There's no sense of any
[5822.01s -> 5831.93s]  globe geography.
[5831.93s -> 5833.93s]  Oh, I couldn't even do it.
[5833.93s -> 5837.58s]  The property of the Bomba Club
[5837.58s -> 5839.58s]  North Spring Street,
[5839.58s -> 5841.58s]  downtown.
[5841.58s -> 5851.56s]  That's not real. See, I told you.
[5851.56s -> 5853.56s]  Swiggity Swanky just gave $50
[5853.56s -> 5855.56s]  right now. 50.
[5855.56s -> 5857.56s]  50 bucks from Swiggity Swanky.
[5857.56s -> 5859.56s]  To prevent a Twitch ban,
[5859.56s -> 5861.56s]  delete the VOD.
[5861.56s -> 5863.56s]  Delete the evidence?
[5863.56s -> 5865.56s]  I'm playing a detective game right now
[5865.56s -> 5868.25s]  and you want me to delete evidence?
[5868.25s -> 5870.25s]  That would go against
[5870.25s -> 5872.25s]  Connor Phelps' Code of Conduct here. I'm not going to do that.
[5872.25s -> 5878.58s]  Thank you so much for the 50 bucks, though.
[5878.58s -> 5882.55s]  Really appreciate it, dude. That's a lot of money. Thank you.
[5882.55s -> 5893.42s]  The victim's bag?
[5893.42s -> 5896.17s]  We've got keys,
[5896.17s -> 5899.94s]  battery.
[5899.94s -> 5901.94s]  Looks brand new. Can't be the one used on the bottom.
[5901.94s -> 5903.94s]  I don't know why I was just going to say this.
[5903.94s -> 5905.94s]  And you're talking about me being concerned about
[5905.94s -> 5908.76s]  T.O.S.
[5908.76s -> 5910.76s]  I was about to just say two words.
[5910.76s -> 5913.26s]  That was it.
[5913.26s -> 5915.26s]  Three letter, four letter.
[5915.26s -> 5918.71s]  That's all I was going to say.
[5918.71s -> 5920.71s]  I don't know why I was just going to say that.
[5920.71s -> 5925.83s]  What's wrong with me?
[5925.83s -> 5927.83s]  What have you guys done to me?
[5927.83s -> 5930.84s]  I used to be so wholesome.
[5930.84s -> 5934.36s]  But I didn't even swear.
[5934.36s -> 5936.36s]  Can we get to the bomba?
[5936.36s -> 5947.86s]  Dude.
[5947.86s -> 5949.86s]  Come on. 15 seconds. I got the achievement.
[5949.86s -> 5962.22s]  15 seconds. Jump over three things.
[5962.22s -> 5964.22s]  How about we go to the bomba?
[5964.22s -> 5977.83s]  The bomba.
[5977.83s -> 5979.83s]  You're driving, you maniac.
[5979.83s -> 5981.83s]  My name's Jerma. I just look at map.
[5981.83s -> 5984.07s]  And see that it
[5984.07s -> 5986.25s]  I drive that way.
[5986.25s -> 5988.25s]  Blip is straight ahead. I drive straight ahead.
[5988.25s -> 5995.16s]  Me Jerma, me just fall off.
[5995.16s -> 5997.16s]  Cole, come on.
[5997.16s -> 5999.46s]  Okay, me go right now.
[5999.46s -> 6002.02s]  This is the cookie monster.
[6002.02s -> 6004.02s]  This is not in the right voice.
[6004.02s -> 6006.90s]  The werewolf? For my money?
[6006.90s -> 6008.90s]  We can't rule it out. We need to work the evidence.
[6008.90s -> 6010.90s]  You'd love that, wouldn't you?
[6010.90s -> 6012.90s]  A big head to hang on the wall.
[6012.90s -> 6015.08s]  For the decade.
[6015.08s -> 6017.08s]  Been working evidence and beat EKs for six months and got nicks.
[6017.08s -> 6019.08s]  There's a difference, Rusty.
[6019.08s -> 6021.08s]  Oh? Yeah? I just don't be working it today.
[6021.08s -> 6023.08s]  Okay, odd shot.
[6023.08s -> 6025.08s]  What's more like it?
[6025.08s -> 6027.08s]  The werewolf come back well, leaving us a note in the corpse?
[6027.08s -> 6029.08s]  He clearly has a thing for power.
[6029.08s -> 6031.08s]  Power over women.
[6031.08s -> 6033.08s]  Why not power over the police department as well?
[6033.08s -> 6035.08s]  Let me finish this.
[6035.08s -> 6037.08s]  A guy opens his mouth again after six months.
[6037.08s -> 6039.08s]  I can't believe it.
[6039.08s -> 6041.38s]  Come on.
[6041.38s -> 6043.38s]  Come on. I don't got all day.
[6043.38s -> 6046.33s]  Finish, Phelps.
[6046.33s -> 6048.33s]  A guy opens his mouth again after six months of shtoon.
[6048.33s -> 6050.33s]  Or some...
[6050.33s -> 6052.33s]  Breathe, Phelps.
[6052.33s -> 6054.33s]  Breathe, dammit.
[6054.33s -> 6058.30s]  I turned off the dialogue.
[6058.30s -> 6060.79s]  That's not totally fantastical.
[6060.79s -> 6062.79s]  You know, the examiner in the daily news might be good at coming up with...
[6062.79s -> 6064.79s]  Turn on cinematic camera?
[6064.79s -> 6066.79s]  Can you? There is none.
[6066.79s -> 6068.79s]  There's a reason we didn't get the son of a bitch after the short murder was them locusts.
[6068.79s -> 6070.79s]  What do you think the werewolf killer is now?
[6070.79s -> 6072.79s]  What do you think the werewolf killer is now?
[6072.79s -> 6074.79s]  What do you think the tool keys are now?
[6074.79s -> 6076.79s]  ...somewhere else with the armed forces.
[6076.79s -> 6078.79s]  San Quentin.
[6078.79s -> 6080.79s]  Another town.
[6080.79s -> 6083.03s]  Another country. Who knows?
[6083.03s -> 6085.03s]  So, Phelps, I understand you want to turn this into a big case.
[6085.03s -> 6087.03s]  But it doesn't work like that, alright?
[6087.03s -> 6089.03s]  A case will come and find you.
[6089.03s -> 6091.03s]  Can't make it something it ain't, understand?
[6091.03s -> 6093.03s]  So you don't think the werewolf has continued to operate in the Los Angeles area?
[6093.03s -> 6095.03s]  No chance.
[6095.03s -> 6097.03s]  We would have found him.
[6097.03s -> 6101.43s]  I need Sentra again.
[6101.43s -> 6112.31s]  Just go easy, Phelps.
[6112.63s -> 6149.56s]  Say something
[6150.08s -> 6166.65s]  Gentleman, what can I get you Phelps and Galloway LAPD chocolate nothing here last night? Yes

[6181.17s -> 6186.17s]  Five feet seven about 110 pounds blonde hair about 40 years of age
[6186.81s -> 6188.81s]  You mean Celine Henry?
[6190.46s -> 6192.46s]  You know her name. Yes
[6192.70s -> 6197.99s]  Do you know anything about her? I don't but the owner mr. McCall serves her most nights
[6198.39s -> 6200.39s]  Would you like to speak to him? I would
[6200.71s -> 6206.61s]  He said to the back of the club. Where's the hibiscus? You can't miss him. Is there anything else?
[6207.49s -> 6211.78s]  Quiet away Phelps. I'll stay here. I'm a little parched
[6212.70s -> 6214.70s]  Warming three fingers of rye
[6215.18s -> 6218.50s]  Say honey, what time you get off?
[6219.38s -> 6227.18s]  Where is on a tip refill my coffee next time honey, that's probably the guy just sitting back here by himself

[6255.08s -> 6256.79s]  McCall
[6256.79s -> 6265.29s]  Hmm. Hey, you spray me with that flower
[6266.01s -> 6270.20s]  Was mrs. Henry here with anyone last night? Not at first
[6271.47s -> 6274.91s]  Celine already had quite a head start, but she attracted attention
[6275.67s -> 6276.91s]  certainly a
[6276.91s -> 6279.91s]  Few gentlemen became very enamored with her and her stories
[6281.71s -> 6293.54s]  One guy in particular one guy in particular, you know him going no
[6294.48s -> 6298.67s]  He's been in a couple of times. Did they leave together?
[6299.17s -> 6300.17s]  Yes
[6300.17s -> 6301.93s]  at around 11
[6301.93s -> 6304.81s]  If it helps I made the guy's license plate. Ooh

[6317.24s -> 6322.73s]  Okay, anything else? That's it
[6322.97s -> 6325.72s]  You're a license plate maker
[6328.82s -> 6330.82s]  All right, so she's missing a ring
[6331.30s -> 6335.46s]  Mrs. Henry appeared to be missing a ring torn from her finger, but not her wedding finger
[6336.34s -> 6338.46s]  Celine always wore a red garnet ring
[6339.14s -> 6341.14s]  on the large side
[6341.30s -> 6346.38s]  Larger than life like Celine herself. Did she have it a long time? Sure
[6347.50s -> 6352.15s]  It's way back in her flying days. Did her husband buy it for no it was
[6353.03s -> 6355.03s]  It's before Jacob
[6355.75s -> 6360.42s]  Haha. Oh, yeah
[6360.42s -> 6364.02s]  Really? You got an itch in your ass or what's happening here, man?
[6364.02s -> 6369.58s]  I think you know where the ring came from and I think you're gonna tell me. Okay, I bought it years ago
[6369.78s -> 6372.76s]  Got him. I carried a torch for Celine in those days
[6373.48s -> 6375.48s]  I guess I always have

[6389.37s -> 6391.23s]  Sure. I know Jacob
[6391.23s -> 6392.83s]  He was in the corps
[6392.83s -> 6395.87s]  He met Celine on a furlough and married her when the war was finished
[6397.05s -> 6399.05s]  Put up with a load of shit
[6399.29s -> 6402.92s]  Do you think he killed his wife? No
[6404.04s -> 6406.04s]  No, not in my opinion
[6407.31s -> 6410.43s]  All right, this guy's got this guy that was very clear
[6411.85s -> 6413.85s]  Those are very clear. I do know

[6418.49s -> 6421.93s]  So if it wasn't Jacob, then you probably let her out of here with the guy who killed her
[6422.01s -> 6427.37s]  How do you feel about that stole the attitude? Will you know maybe not I tried to get on to Jacob
[6428.17s -> 6429.61s]  I rang him up
[6429.61s -> 6431.61s]  Asked him to come pick her up like usual
[6432.25s -> 6434.75s]  But he refused
[6434.99s -> 6437.90s]  As she picked some night to push him over the edge
[6438.78s -> 6442.76s]  I rang him back around 11 30, but got no answer
[6444.49s -> 6448.25s]  One out of four again. Thanks. Mr. McCaul. Oh, do you think three out of three? Correct?

[6587.50s -> 6591.74s]  I know it's not a job as long as you're not falling over rusty. I'll let it slide

[6607.18s -> 6609.18s]  It's not political. It's practical

[6613.74s -> 6617.74s]  So today is today is thursday that would have led to her killer. I think today's friday

[6653.56s -> 6661.66s]  I know you thought nevada was mountain time. It is pacific time because it sits right there on the edge on the bottom tail part

[6684.40s -> 6686.48s]  Maybe I drive better if you shut the hell up
[6687.21s -> 6688.17s]  See
[6688.17s -> 6691.76s]  That's what I have to say. Maybe I would drive better
[6700.35s -> 6702.35s]  Yeah, i'm gonna get another code four here
[6702.43s -> 6706.75s]  I'm currently sitting inside of a car about to explode just might as well call it in and get it ready
[6707.71s -> 6709.15s]  and uh have a
[6709.15s -> 6711.15s]  That's when they cut out because the car exploded
[6714.35s -> 6716.35s]  Hello, who's here?
[6736.80s -> 6738.80s]  I can't just go to the front door
[6740.94s -> 6742.94s]  What was that the back door?
[6745.05s -> 6747.74s]  I have to look in the
[6748.30s -> 6750.30s]  That I have to go in the front door
[6751.72s -> 6753.80s]  All right, come on. That's a weird front door. It is
[6755.13s -> 6759.29s]  What is this door? I've never seen a house with a door wedged into the side like that
[6759.69s -> 6762.57s]  I'll try the back door right here. That's what I just did
[6763.29s -> 6765.29s]  So I was already one step ahead of you
[6765.37s -> 6778.75s]  I thought I was gonna elbow the glass
[6792.46s -> 6796.36s]  This game would be more immersive if like every three or four seconds he went
[6799.42s -> 6802.36s]  And there's no way to turn it off
[6803.24s -> 6810.97s]  Oh, here's another
[6810.97s -> 6813.55s]  family burnt to death
[6813.55s -> 6816.68s]  Well, I'm saying house fire deaths are suspicious
[6818.27s -> 6819.71s]  That's okay
[6819.71s -> 6832.83s]  You said I had to go back doctor. The fires are cathartic
[6833.61s -> 6838.01s]  They allow you to confront your past. You said the house would be empty
[6838.65s -> 6841.21s]  Are you taking the medication I have prescribed?
[6842.22s -> 6844.22s]  You said the house would be empty
[6844.88s -> 6846.88s]  I heard them screaming
[6847.52s -> 6849.52s]  Circumstances were unfortunate
[6850.24s -> 6854.40s]  My colleagues had made all the necessary arrangements the house would be empty
[6855.12s -> 6861.44s]  You're killing me the deaths were unfortunate but you have dealt with death before
[6862.24s -> 6866.27s]  I want you to come here. You said the house will be empty
[6869.93s -> 6877.87s]  No, that's the weirdest wrong number i've ever had
[6888.16s -> 6889.52s]  Okay
[6889.52s -> 6891.12s]  Let's search
[6891.12s -> 6897.85s]  Come on. Give me some clicks
[6897.85s -> 6902.99s]  Give me some clicks
[6902.99s -> 6906.11s]  Goggles it would take a smarter man than me to connect that. Oh
[6910.24s -> 6918.04s]  I heard a chime. I don't think that's right though
[6918.84s -> 6920.36s]  No, where?
[6920.36s -> 6924.99s]  They have all these audio cues in the game and then they play a bunch of other ones
[6928.40s -> 6932.49s]  This isn't what we're looking at. That's a key though. You can at least test to see where it goes to
[6933.29s -> 6935.32s]  fireplace
[6935.32s -> 6938.28s]  Mirror, uh, he's definitely filming somebody from the other side of this wall
[6938.92s -> 6946.35s]  All right, let's we're gonna go corner to corner here start on the front door
[6947.07s -> 6954.88s]  Burglar used the pry bar. Why did you kick the door in?
[6955.52s -> 6960.72s]  You think i'm gonna climb through a broken window in a 30 suit. You got another thing coming buster
[6961.44s -> 6963.04s]  He's that's true
[6963.04s -> 6967.74s]  Because as we all know with inflation, that's like five grand
[6972.17s -> 6974.17s]  Everybody drinks the same alcohol
[6974.57s -> 6986.57s]  Oh good to me
[6986.57s -> 6988.57s]  Yeah, like that's just one small complaint
[6989.39s -> 6992.91s]  Is like I wish like it's 30 bucks back then but like it's fucking 2006
[6993.47s -> 6997.47s]  Obviously having problems just make it like that what it would be actually if it cost it would be like, you know
[6997.47s -> 6999.55s]  1500 bucks is like a really expensive suit
[7000.99s -> 7008.78s]  Irritating, you know, give us something to go. She's over up. You can find me at apartment two
[7008.78s -> 7009.98s]  Two
[7009.98s -> 7011.84s]  Okay
[7011.84s -> 7015.60s]  No, one of my edges drank like this to be feeling the back of my hand
[7016.16s -> 7020.72s]  That's when the game came out in burglary and get technical services out here. I'll talk to the neighbors
[7022.08s -> 7025.12s]  Don't take all day. I thought it felt so I get nasty when i'm thirsty
[7027.56s -> 7032.60s]  nothing
[7032.60s -> 7035.08s]  Galloway homicide badge number five sixty four
[7035.64s -> 7040.44s]  Requesting technical services for a suspected 459 at 142 north union
[7041.16s -> 7048.44s]  No, it's not
[7048.44s -> 7052.14s]  Uh, hold on you gotta wait till you hear that
[7053.34s -> 7055.34s]  the little the little
[7055.50s -> 7057.76s]  twinkle
[7057.76s -> 7065.10s]  See the goggles were important a regular Amelia Earhart in her day. The ring looks distinctive
[7066.92s -> 7072.80s]  That's the ring
[7072.80s -> 7075.69s]  speaking of rings
[7075.69s -> 7077.29s]  This is a ring
[7077.29s -> 7080.89s]  Uh, well, actually, I don't know if this could be a couple of different things though
[7082.54s -> 7084.54s]  No, never mind. This is a seed container
[7084.70s -> 7089.34s]  First the stuff is junk. Why explain the missing ring? You can tell because of how deep it is
[7099.23s -> 7101.40s]  about this
[7101.40s -> 7104.09s]  Don't think this is any use to us
[7104.73s -> 7109.76s]  Okay, and that's it
[7109.90s -> 7111.90s]  Congratulations. Now I have to go to the neighbor
[7112.40s -> 7118.32s]  Is that as simple as walking next door? Do I have to drive there? Wait, what was that twinkle?
[7120.54s -> 7123.36s]  See
[7123.36s -> 7132.94s]  Now it's the newspaper. Never mind a pretentious streamer references himself only things still important to him. What the fuck
[7134.16s -> 7140.99s]  Which neighbor is it?
[7140.99s -> 7143.31s]  There's a bunch of neighbors this how this one
[7144.35s -> 7148.86s]  Oh, there's a neighbor
[7148.86s -> 7150.28s]  Hey
[7150.28s -> 7152.92s]  It wasn't safe around here anymore. Are you the neighbor?
[7154.73s -> 7155.85s]  I guess
[7155.85s -> 7159.45s]  LAPD, I guess you're the neighbor henry miss horgan
[7159.99s -> 7161.77s]  Jennifer horgan
[7161.77s -> 7164.97s]  I've known selene for more than 10 years our children grew up together
[7165.85s -> 7172.41s]  What's going on officer? Did you see mrs henry go out last night? Well, I'm no busybody you understand but
[7173.77s -> 7178.57s]  Selene had been drinking and she and poor long-suffering jacob had a terrible row
[7179.53s -> 7181.69s]  What's around jacob may have given her a black eye
[7182.33s -> 7185.85s]  He stormed out and she went back inside. Did he come back? No
[7186.57s -> 7190.33s]  Selene was listening to music and shouting until she left around 10 pm
[7190.97s -> 7193.13s]  She was very drunk to have been driving
[7193.61s -> 7197.53s]  But she is not the sort of person you can stop from doing something when her dander is up
[7198.01s -> 7200.89s]  It was my hat. What is this about officer? Is selene all right?
[7201.37s -> 7203.61s]  I'm afraid mrs henry has been murdered ma'am
[7204.47s -> 7207.02s]  murdered
[7207.02s -> 7208.78s]  Oh my god
[7208.78s -> 7212.96s]  I'm afraid I need to go and then sit down
[7213.76s -> 7221.88s]  All right, make sure you lock your door too because the murderer said he was coming here to kill you next
[7222.60s -> 7224.60s]  Imagine you imagine there was an option
[7224.60s -> 7238.75s]  Have a good day. Let's see what jacob has to say for himself. I don't think jacob is our man
[7238.75s -> 7240.75s]  But we should see what he has to say
[7243.29s -> 7248.97s]  How do you start using these I have these free points
[7249.85s -> 7259.20s]  Jacob henry the husband strange husband jacob henry had a violent argument with his wife last night
[7259.44s -> 7261.44s]  He's looking more likely row
[7262.72s -> 7265.60s]  The rod keeps the house looking like that's probably deserved
[7266.64s -> 7271.76s]  The skipper says bring him in keep the hatchet back for a while fine by me hidden object
[7271.76s -> 7276.32s]  So it ain't the werewolf killer after all to every opening from mission impossible movies
[7276.48s -> 7278.32s]  I always said work the evidence
[7278.32s -> 7282.56s]  I only stipulated a connection to the bd killer as an avenue of investigation
[7282.56s -> 7285.52s]  We should leave open and as far as i'm concerned it still is
[7286.24s -> 7295.07s]  And then eventually this is gonna go
[7296.51s -> 7304.38s]  It's gonna be an elaborate intro
[7316.16s -> 7317.84s]  Just get out of the car
[7317.84s -> 7320.32s]  Climb over the fence like a real gamer
[7325.80s -> 7328.12s]  You but you can handle that one, but you can't handle this one
[7332.22s -> 7333.42s]  Whoa?

[8068.44s -> 8072.76s]  Didn't even record your mother like saying weird sentences for like your school project
[8079.56s -> 8081.56s]  All right, where are we going?
[8083.42s -> 8086.28s]  here
[8086.28s -> 8087.96s]  Alonzo mendez
[8087.96s -> 8092.92s]  Sound like a man who moonlights as the werewolf don't sound like a man. I'd let my daughter anywhere in here
[8093.24s -> 8095.96s]  You've got a daughter spend enough time drink. How old are you?

[8118.30s -> 8125.02s]  I use a pay phone guys. I used to call my parents collect because I got detention
[8126.30s -> 8132.22s]  I needed to tell them that they had to come and get me later. They know exactly what they're gonna get
[8133.34s -> 8150.14s]  This is the apartment
[8150.14s -> 8152.38s]  Wait, why was it? I got a little twinkle here. Hold on
[8154.14s -> 8156.72s]  16 mendez apartment 16
[8159.56s -> 8161.56s]  Why was I a bad kid?
[8161.64s -> 8166.24s]  I mean bad kid
[8166.32s -> 8169.76s]  Detention didn't mean you were a bad kid detention means that you had a teacher
[8170.80s -> 8178.00s]  That didn't like the fact that you would take your shnakers off in class and juggle them while they were trying to do a lesson
[8178.48s -> 8179.76s]  You know like
[8179.76s -> 8189.45s]  shut up teacher
[8189.45s -> 8191.45s]  Here the apartment's up on the top floor
[8191.61s -> 8201.50s]  I mean, it's not like one time I hid it in the closet in my history class
[8204.20s -> 8209.08s]  And stayed in there for probably five full minutes while the teacher was starting the class
[8211.08s -> 8213.56s]  And then I just fucking burst it out and fell down on the floor
[8216.00s -> 8221.28s]  That actually happened. All right, where are we going?
[8224.17s -> 8235.30s]  16 no elevator here
[8235.72s -> 8244.41s]  You just kick the door in
[8244.41s -> 8246.41s]  Oh, I've always wanted to do that
[8247.72s -> 8250.04s]  Oh more notepad stuff any more invisible ink
[8252.81s -> 8255.77s]  Elevators didn't exist in these times. Yes, they did. I just took them on
[8257.92s -> 8276.54s]  Don't lie to the streamer. Don't lie to me. I doubt it. It looked like anything
[8279.61s -> 8291.13s]  gee
[8292.25s -> 8295.87s]  Somebody said fear fear
[8304.60s -> 8310.20s]  Fear fuck cursive, man, probably nothing

[8320.94s -> 8322.38s]  record player
[8322.38s -> 8328.04s]  Books. Oh, wait, i'm not done with this. That's the only door i'm allowed to kick down, isn't it?
[8328.60s -> 8335.05s]  What does it want me to do cigarettes?
[8342.48s -> 8344.00s]  Did I miss anything else?
[8344.00s -> 8347.68s]  What about over here?
[8347.68s -> 8349.04s]  and uh
[8349.04s -> 8351.12s]  What is this weird? What's about this weird room?
[8351.84s -> 8355.72s]  This apartment is very strange
[8355.72s -> 8358.92s]  This is a weird apartment man that like the apartments aren't like this
[8359.72s -> 8365.40s]  Okay, so we have
[8365.40s -> 8368.24s]  the clothes on the ground
[8368.24s -> 8370.41s]  got a dresser
[8371.50s -> 8373.50s]  and then a painting set
[8373.58s -> 8376.08s]  None of that looks important
[8376.08s -> 8377.44s]  um
[8377.44s -> 8378.72s]  A toy
[8378.72s -> 8384.54s]  No, this is room's clean
[8384.54s -> 8386.89s]  a shoe
[8386.89s -> 8391.61s]  We got him how to get these to ray size eight could help place mendez at the scene this dad
[8391.61s -> 8393.13s]  This dude was there
[8393.13s -> 8396.73s]  Found the killer don't even need egg. I got this. This is like the feet crime
[8397.75s -> 8408.28s]  Insistent with selene's injuries and the blood can be typed
[8414.25s -> 8422.30s]  And this looks like some lipstick doesn't it same one same brand brothers could match the color and brand of the body
[8422.86s -> 8436.24s]  We have the murder weapon better get pinker down here. Why keep it? Why not throw it away?
[8436.32s -> 8438.32s]  I think these clowns are geniuses
[8438.48s -> 8441.92s]  Thank your stars. You caught a break captain donald begin to like you
[8443.28s -> 8446.64s]  Hey, what gives la pd you're under arrest
[8448.86s -> 8451.34s]  Do not lose that son of a bitch stay right there
[8453.79s -> 8455.79s]  Mendez stop right there
[8456.72s -> 8459.76s]  I just need to look at your feet. That's all I need to do
[8460.56s -> 8471.80s]  Can I dark souls him? You don't need to do this alonzo
[8472.52s -> 8491.00s]  Ow, he's gonna get away
[8496.08s -> 8498.96s]  No, don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. I had an opportunity and I did see
[8503.80s -> 8506.04s]  I could have driven driven right into the gas station
[8506.68s -> 8523.37s]  But I didn't where you going, man. I got an idea
[8524.09s -> 8529.05s]  Get him next to my window call keep me alongside his vehicle and i'll stop the son of a bitch
[8530.41s -> 8531.61s]  Okay
[8531.61s -> 8539.36s]  Hit him cold spin him out
[8540.03s -> 8541.61s]  Come on
[8541.61s -> 8542.73s]  Get it
[8542.73s -> 8546.81s]  Got it. I'm trying to shoot out his tires. All right. Well, well now what do we do?
[8547.29s -> 8549.61s]  No, he's he's he's in there get him out of there. What?
[8551.47s -> 8555.63s]  Get him out. You don't need to shoot his tires anymore. This thing's gonna blow up
[8564.89s -> 8568.09s]  That is that it did I beat him? Did I win?
[8568.65s -> 8580.62s]  I ain't saying a goddamn thing
[8585.45s -> 8587.37s]  and justice
[8587.37s -> 8590.72s]  Has been served
[8590.72s -> 8592.72s]  You did a grand job lads
[8593.28s -> 8594.56s]  folks
[8594.56s -> 8598.72s]  That's quite a way to acquit yourself in your first outing as a homicide investigator
[8599.52s -> 8602.32s]  It seems this city has a new and vengeful guardian
[8603.52s -> 8608.24s]  Considering the evidence against your suspect my feet do all the talking with which a report was compiled
[8608.32s -> 8612.16s]  I foresee a safe passage through the courts and the d.a agrees with me
[8613.48s -> 8616.40s]  Brutality on a scale such as this deserves retribution
[8617.50s -> 8618.86s]  the people
[8618.86s -> 8627.76s]  And the press of this city demanded I didn't oh, that was awkward
[8630.19s -> 8631.79s]  I did all the work though
[8631.79s -> 8638.14s]  So how was our report there 18 and uh, that was
[8639.02s -> 8644.30s]  Come on that's pretty good. That's close enough 18 out of 19 5 out of 6. I got one question wrong
[8647.95s -> 8653.39s]  I'm never gonna make any money though
[8653.93s -> 8656.19s]  5,000 that's like it's like
[8657.80s -> 8660.76s]  That's like what 50 60 70 thousand dollars
[8662.35s -> 8666.88s]  Do I have to make any money?
[8666.88s -> 8669.08s]  That's only a b
[8669.08s -> 8682.27s]  That's what that's fine
[8693.69s -> 8698.24s]  Thirsty
[8709.50s -> 8732.28s]  It is the golden butterfly the game is fun it's always a guy with a club
[8738.03s -> 8742.51s]  Galloway got it skipper
[8744.99s -> 8748.19s]  I think this is the nudity mission. Oh that we already saw the nudity mission
[8749.16s -> 8751.64s]  Unless there's a nudity mission after the nudity mission
[8752.52s -> 8758.20s]  New case in which case male dumped in plain sight in the grass at the end of hill street hacks are all over it
[8758.68s -> 8761.72s]  Captains trying to fend them off that sounds awfully similar
[8762.52s -> 8766.36s]  The first rule of police work is make no assumptions until you've seen the evidence wait
[8766.44s -> 8769.56s]  Are we breaking open like a serial killer case where so, okay
[8769.64s -> 8771.96s]  Hold on a minute here. I think we're getting to the meat and potatoes
[8771.96s -> 8776.68s]  I think I know the place where they found the lady it overlooks somebody's a serial killer. Let's go
[8778.75s -> 8784.35s]  All right. Oh, give me a second. Give me uh, let me just grab um, i'm like i'm craving something. You know what I mean?
[8784.99s -> 8786.35s]  I'll be right back
[8786.35s -> 8790.03s]  Give me like uh, give me like i'm gonna like blend up some fruits. Okay
[8790.59s -> 8796.65s]  I'll be back in like 40 minutes. I'm just kidding. Don't I me just saying that probably made everybody leave i'm back in two minutes
[8797.29s -> 9059.36s]  All right beer back. All right
[9061.07s -> 9063.07s]  I'm sorry. I had to make something
[9067.00s -> 9069.00s]  This one's even this one's even
[9069.32s -> 9072.32s]  see
[9072.32s -> 9075.28s]  Well, okay, that looks really fucking gross in this tiny camera
[9075.84s -> 9078.46s]  That looks like a blood-stained windshield
[9079.10s -> 9086.44s]  All right. Hold on. It's fruits. It's blueberries
[9087.06s -> 9089.06s]  blackberries raspberries
[9089.47s -> 9090.99s]  It's fruits guys
[9090.99s -> 9096.04s]  And it gets like stuck in your teeth. It's the worst
[9097.13s -> 9101.45s]  Anyways, I don't have cameras on because I don't do cam. I don't do it
[9103.10s -> 9105.31s]  You understand?
[9105.31s -> 9107.31s]  Guys, I don't do cam
[9114.43s -> 9116.43s]  I thought that was a close-up of a tortilla
[9116.83s -> 9118.83s]  No, that was my face
[9118.83s -> 9120.83s]  That was my face
[9120.83s -> 9122.81s]  Yeah
[9122.81s -> 9124.81s]  Yeah, yeah
[9126.83s -> 9128.83s]  He's so insecure. No, I don't like
[9130.11s -> 9133.95s]  I don't like this. Let me look. I don't like this
[9134.75s -> 9144.76s]  The reason why I don't like face cam is because like i'm it's i'm just like here
[9145.74s -> 9148.14s]  Just sitting here people just looking at my face
[9149.02s -> 9160.14s]  You did a decent job in the henry case felps not bad for your first time. Just in case you're curious. I'm still here
[9160.78s -> 9164.70s]  Don't go getting ahead of yourself. That's one clearance under your belt
[9165.18s -> 9168.38s]  Now it's a new day with a new dead lady that needs our attention
[9168.94s -> 9171.26s]  No assumptions until we see the evidence, right?
[9171.90s -> 9177.58s]  Right, I sure am adding a lot to this video footage here might get long after all
[9186.22s -> 9193.64s]  Phelps d what d what?
[9195.00s -> 9200.14s]  Where are we supposed to go up top? Okay, I fucked it up. You have to react more
[9201.32s -> 9207.68s]  Okay
[9207.68s -> 9230.44s]  Jesus felps, where am I fucking going? I have to go up get back in the car. I've got to go up and then right
[9242.84s -> 9247.44s]  Give us more reactions calm down
[9247.92s -> 9250.34s]  Reaction i'll give you a reaction
[9251.36s -> 9255.26s]  Oh boys boys, you know as much as I do
[9256.06s -> 9259.26s]  I'll be holding a press conference once the autopsy is being completed
[9261.66s -> 9264.54s]  I have two of my finest investigators on the case
[9265.26s -> 9273.50s]  Fresh from bringing down the sword of justice on the crazed sex captain aren't there similarities between this murder and the murder of selene henry?
[9273.66s -> 9278.22s]  Yeah, here's the big one elizabeth short for that matter. You don't believe there's a crazed sex killer at large
[9278.86s -> 9280.86s]  Women boys be sensible
[9281.34s -> 9285.50s]  We have the greatest police force in the world with the greatest guy. He's the serial killer
[9286.62s -> 9289.74s]  All right, let's play red dead. I figured it out. How can any killer continue to be that?
[9290.62s -> 9292.92s]  be advised
[9292.92s -> 9299.32s]  We keep the gas chamber at san quentin primed for the sons of king who continue to believe they can take a life in the city
[9299.32s -> 9303.16s]  Of angels. Yeah, right any new leads in the dahlia case
[9304.92s -> 9307.32s]  Run along boys and let these officers get to work
[9308.20s -> 9313.16s]  We have god's work. I'm still having fun playing this one. Why would I change games when I was liking and playing this one?
[9313.16s -> 9315.72s]  What do we have captain?
[9315.72s -> 9320.36s]  I got the same body type as him that same side like stomach profiles. I know what it's like
[9330.00s -> 9332.50s]  You know, you know what you have the same stomach profile
[9334.17s -> 9336.01s]  You were first on scene you
[9336.01s -> 9339.05s]  So what happened shows over keep moving all of you?
[9339.85s -> 9341.85s]  Who was first on scene? Which one of you?
[9342.75s -> 9344.78s]  You
[9344.78s -> 9346.43s]  What did you do?
[9346.43s -> 9349.63s]  What happened here?
[9349.63s -> 9351.93s]  Who did it? Why is there a blip here?
[9352.49s -> 9355.74s]  What do you want me to make sure the evidence gets back? What do you think sir?
[9356.22s -> 9365.29s]  Oh, god damn it. It's another fucking naked body
[9366.17s -> 9371.87s]  Is it like a guy?
[9371.87s -> 9377.95s]  Similar remote what the dahlia shit? I don't think so. Celine henry. That's a closed case
[9378.59s -> 9383.23s]  This is probably another sad sack who lost his temper with the proud. Is it naked bodies from here on out?
[9383.95s -> 9385.95s]  Watch your mouth though
[9385.95s -> 9392.75s]  All i'm saying is we got enough to do without reopening closed cases. Talk me through it now severely battered on display
[9393.39s -> 9395.55s]  Footprints would indicate that she has been stomped
[9396.11s -> 9401.07s]  Size of the footprints would seem to indicate a smallish men's shoe. What's a shoe did mendez wear?
[9401.79s -> 9403.79s]  You finished no, i'm not
[9404.03s -> 9408.91s]  At a glance, I would say strangulation is the cause of death. I need to do further tests for semen
[9410.11s -> 9414.75s]  Angry boyfriend they were married. They'd be at home not humping out here in lovers lane
[9415.55s -> 9417.63s]  You mind if I examine the body you might guess
[9418.51s -> 9430.41s]  Okay, whatever up
[9430.41s -> 9432.65s]  Look at your mark is very distinctive
[9433.53s -> 9436.17s]  I'll do some comparisons back to the lab and get back to you
[9440.81s -> 9446.11s]  She's looking around for like a car or something. This is fucked up. It looks like she was tied up
[9447.31s -> 9452.51s]  Does it first but that would leave a mark on her other wrist too. Let's check out her watch might have been torn off
[9459.15s -> 9462.22s]  No wrong. No, no
[9462.22s -> 9467.88s]  Quick quick quick quick quick. I don't want to be here any longer than I have to what's this another wedding ring finger
[9468.76s -> 9470.76s]  fourth finger left hand
[9470.84s -> 9474.92s]  wedding or engagement ring violently removed this is the same thing as the other one
[9477.08s -> 9479.08s]  Am I like in bizarro land? Are we doing the same one?
[9479.96s -> 9488.14s]  The stopping angle in the henry case was it reported in the press small men's footprint was
[9488.78s -> 9491.50s]  Every detail a copycat would want was there in the story
[9492.54s -> 9493.96s]  Okay
[9493.96s -> 9498.72s]  I think that's it
[9498.72s -> 9504.41s]  Anything else
[9508.49s -> 9511.56s]  Oh emote only mode

[9960.08s -> 9962.08s]  Half of these things are so fucking embarrassing
[9963.05s -> 9965.05s]  Times 10 if the webcam was on
[9965.45s -> 9967.45s]  Don't forget somebody's birthday
[9967.45s -> 9973.48s]  But I told you I would be doing this shit. I'd be saying like
[9974.44s -> 9985.15s]  Cabot if the stream was off. I'll give you a real story here. So after I watched infinity war, uh
[9985.95s -> 9987.55s]  Me and kim watched it
[9987.63s -> 9989.63s]  And I didn't even know I had no idea
[9990.19s -> 9992.19s]  Uh kim walked in
[9992.27s -> 9996.03s]  I was just sitting there on the computer and she's like, will you please stop?
[9996.59s -> 9998.99s]  I was like, what are you? What are you talking about? What do you mean? Please stop?
[9999.15s -> 10003.71s]  She's like you keep saying the same line from her body and I was just sitting up here going
[10003.95s -> 10005.95s]  I know what it's like to lose
[10006.72s -> 10008.72s]  To know so desperately that you're right
[10009.52s -> 10011.52s]  Like I was doing it like over and over again
[10012.56s -> 10024.11s]  I was just doing it. We're getting a couple of seed boxes. No sign of a wedding ring
[10024.99s -> 10028.99s]  So everyone everyone that thinks me saying like oh cabbage is like no I I would be doing that
[10030.04s -> 10034.22s]  In fact, I would be doing it like 15 times more if I wasn't on camera
[10039.10s -> 10042.30s]  It's actually keeping me in check being like recorded
[10044.00s -> 10049.74s]  feet

[10139.74s -> 10144.65s]  Rose gold wedding band and the matching diamond and ruby engagement ring
[10145.29s -> 10146.89s]  She wore a watch
[10146.89s -> 10147.85s]  Yes
[10147.85s -> 10149.85s]  the yellow gold elgin watch
[10150.25s -> 10152.25s]  Daddy bought it for her birthday
[10152.57s -> 10157.88s]  It was kind of a makeup present
[10158.44s -> 10163.69s]  Okay, last contact. Let me hold away. Let me see this shit first. I don't want to fuck this up
[10165.12s -> 10167.52s]  All right. There's a rope on the lady's neck

[10179.08s -> 10181.08s]  Do we know the make and bottle of that shoe?
[10187.71s -> 10192.19s]  I don't really have much to go on. So when did you last see your mother yesterday afternoon?
[10193.07s -> 10195.56s]  I went to a dance at Belmont high
[10196.60s -> 10202.19s]  I was supposed to pick me up, but she didn't show so what did you do then? I was upset
[10204.62s -> 10211.08s]  Daddy came instead
[10211.08s -> 10213.48s]  Okay. Well now why would she be lying about this?
[10214.52s -> 10222.14s]  Do I have anything?
[10222.14s -> 10224.14s]  And did he come and get you?
[10224.91s -> 10226.80s]  of course
[10226.80s -> 10230.32s]  Some boys offered me a ride home, but I don't I don't sense a why here
[10230.40s -> 10232.40s]  So you were hanging around the school for quite a while
[10233.20s -> 10235.44s]  What happened with your father? I don't know
[10236.00s -> 10237.20s]  what
[10237.20s -> 10240.40s]  I called and called and finally he answered
[10241.28s -> 10243.28s]  He came straight away then
[10244.64s -> 10249.63s]  Oh, we're getting rocky here. Your mom and dad are
[10250.51s -> 10252.35s]  Happily married
[10252.35s -> 10254.59s]  What are you saying? Of course they are
[10258.06s -> 10260.06s]  Oh, yeah
[10260.60s -> 10264.44s]  Why is dad picking you up instead?
[10264.44s -> 10270.68s]  They weren't happy were they Michelle? Did your father ever hit your mother? Just the once if the one
[10271.08s -> 10273.24s]  She said she would leave him if he ever did it again
[10274.44s -> 10276.81s]  Her brooch pin to make up for it
[10277.45s -> 10280.65s]  Always wore her golden butterfly
[10282.01s -> 10285.37s]  Thanks, miss muller tooth two out of three. What was the third? What?
[10287.63s -> 10289.63s]  Hold on. What was the third issue?
[10290.51s -> 10292.51s]  Daddy the police are here
[10292.83s -> 10295.39s]  I'll talk to the police
[10295.71s -> 10298.27s]  She wasn't telling the truth on she's not even out of school
[10298.59s -> 10302.43s]  You can't come in here interrogating her like she's your wife was found murdered this morning
[10303.63s -> 10305.55s]  Found oh
[10305.55s -> 10309.45s]  But she only
[10309.45s -> 10314.92s]  We have some questions that we would like to ask you
[10315.72s -> 10317.02s]  Sure. Yeah
[10317.02s -> 10318.22s]  Yeah, i'll do my best

[10325.56s -> 10327.56s]  What is that photo down there?
[10328.22s -> 10336.06s]  That's a really odd photo. What size shoe do you wear? Mr. Muller?
[10336.78s -> 10338.68s]  Why do you ask?
[10338.68s -> 10341.02s]  It's routine sir. Simple process of elimination
[10342.56s -> 10346.49s]  Nines, I think
[10346.49s -> 10349.77s]  Bullshit you got eights in the bedroom. You got eights in the bedroom
[10350.41s -> 10352.72s]  He's got eights in the bedroom
[10353.36s -> 10355.36s]  He's got eights in the bedroom
[10361.82s -> 10364.86s]  That's funny. The work boots we found here are size eights
[10365.82s -> 10371.34s]  Why lie about it if you've got nothing to hide book them because I always get teased about the size of my feet
[10373.00s -> 10376.52s]  You know small feet small always been true in my experience
[10377.48s -> 10378.92s]  small what
[10378.92s -> 10381.69s]  small

[10443.60s -> 10447.18s]  Michelle was out of dance. She called me to let me know that deejay didn't turn up
[10448.14s -> 10450.40s]  Oh, that's bullshit
[10450.40s -> 10457.76s]  Because your daughter had to call you motherfucker your wife gotcha by herself to bars nightclub mother fucker
[10458.40s -> 10461.26s]  What are you suggesting you suggesting my wife's loose?
[10462.70s -> 10466.78s]  Now is not the time for you to be pushing me. Mr. Your daughter said you were having an argument
[10467.18s -> 10469.18s]  We argued about who would pick up
[10469.72s -> 10471.34s]  Michelle
[10471.34s -> 10476.62s]  I worked a full day. I wanted to come home put my feet up my vice my size eight feet by the way
[10477.26s -> 10479.52s]  Not that small
[10479.52s -> 10481.52s]  uh alibi
[10486.70s -> 10490.30s]  Michelle bolder reports calling home repeatedly with no answer on the night of the murder
[10494.19s -> 10496.19s]  Okay
[10496.99s -> 10501.07s]  So you were here all night? You stayed in while your wife went out to pick up your daughter
[10502.52s -> 10503.72s]  Yes, that's correct
[10503.72s -> 10514.03s]  Well, I didn't answer the phone. I don't wait right because
[10517.39s -> 10520.43s]  Yeah, you nobody answered. So you didn't yeah
[10520.43s -> 10521.43s]  Yeah, you're in deep shit.
[10528.40s -> 10533.40s]  Yeah, cause your daughter called you over and over again.
[10549.64s -> 10551.94s]  Movements of victim. What the hell does that mean?
[10551.94s -> 10555.20s]  Your wife went to pick up Michelle?
[10555.20s -> 10558.40s]  Yes. That's right.
[10565.40s -> 10573.88s]  What happened, Hugo? You got any theories?
[10573.88s -> 10575.88s]  Because we're starting to like you for this.
[10575.88s -> 10578.70s]  The car park by the school is kind of dark.
[10578.70s -> 10583.26s]  Maybe somebody jumped her there. Did you try the parking lot?
[10587.29s -> 10590.72s]  Your wife was beaten and then strangled.
[10590.72s -> 10592.72s]  In the case you had no alibi.
[10592.72s -> 10594.72s]  And the history of violence taught your wife.
[10594.72s -> 10597.72s]  That's not, that's not true. God damn it.
[10597.72s -> 10600.22s]  Do I have any evidence of that though?
[10600.22s -> 10602.22s]  Can I say your daughter told me?
[10602.22s -> 10606.57s]  I can't say that you did that.
[10614.19s -> 10618.03s]  Oh fuck, alright. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10618.03s -> 10621.03s]  Cause he bought it cause he was trying to be...
[10621.03s -> 10624.03s]  It is true, Hugo. You're a violent man.
[10624.03s -> 10627.03s]  I got it. I got it. Oh my god.
[10627.03s -> 10629.03s]  Can I just take a second?
[10629.03s -> 10631.03s]  Your daughter and your wife were scared of you.
[10631.03s -> 10633.03s]  Brooch. Brooch. Brooch. Brooch.
[10633.03s -> 10635.03s]  I just wanted to look.
[10635.03s -> 10638.42s]  Brooch.
[10638.42s -> 10641.17s]  I know about the golden butterfly, Hugo.
[10641.17s -> 10644.17s]  And how you bought your wife off the last time you heard her.
[10644.17s -> 10646.73s]  She liked to spend money, alright?
[10646.73s -> 10649.73s]  Dresses, jewelry, her hair. It drove me god damn crazy.
[10649.73s -> 10651.73s]  Crazy enough to kill?
[10651.73s -> 10653.73s]  Do I look like a Rockefeller?
[10653.73s -> 10655.73s]  Nobody likes a cheapskate, Hugo.
[10655.73s -> 10657.23s]  Thanks for chiming in.
[10657.23s -> 10659.23s]  Getting hostile with us is a very bad idea, Hugo.
[10659.23s -> 10661.23s]  What was the... I'm no murderer.
[10661.23s -> 10663.23s]  Make some arrangements for your daughter.
[10663.23s -> 10665.23s]  And then present yourself to Central Station for questioning.
[10665.23s -> 10667.23s]  You gotta be kidding me, Phelps. Put the cops on.
[10667.23s -> 10668.23s]  Not good enough.
[10668.23s -> 10670.23s]  This is an outrage. I didn't kill my wife.
[10670.23s -> 10673.23s]  Your daughter is in the next room, Mueller, so I'm giving you a break.
[10673.23s -> 10677.23s]  Don't make me change my mind and don't make me come looking for you.
[10677.23s -> 10686.47s]  We should go back in there and bust his ass.
[10686.47s -> 10689.47s]  One, we need to break his alibi, check phone records, canvas the neighbors.
[10689.47s -> 10693.47s]  Two, we have motive of domestic violence, which probably goes for half the men in L.A.
[10693.47s -> 10697.47s]  Three, we have no evidence tying him to the crime scene.
[10697.47s -> 10698.96s]  Hello. Detective.
[10698.96s -> 10700.96s]  Oh, I thought the MPC was waving.
[10700.96s -> 10705.06s]  Why would we do this?
[10705.06s -> 10709.88s]  Yes, ma'am.
[10709.88s -> 10712.88s]  I heard the terrible news over the radio.
[10712.88s -> 10714.88s]  You heard the terrible news through the window.
[10714.88s -> 10717.88s]  Yes, sir. They had a row last night?
[10717.88s -> 10718.88s]  Seed baby food.
[10718.88s -> 10719.88s]  I heard Mrs. Mueller screaming.
[10719.88s -> 10722.88s]  Did you see Mrs. Mueller come home late last night at all?
[10722.88s -> 10724.88s]  No, not at all.
[10724.88s -> 10728.88s]  I did see Mr. Mueller put something in the incinerator earlier this morning, though.
[10728.88s -> 10732.88s]  I told him he was a god. Let's get this bum downtown and into his cell.
[10732.88s -> 10733.88s]  He's like incinerating his wife's body.
[10733.88s -> 10735.88s]  Look, there he is now.
[10735.88s -> 10738.88s]  There it is. There it is. He's incinerating.
[10738.88s -> 10742.19s]  He's incinerating. Sir, what are you incinerating?
[10742.19s -> 10744.19s]  Step away from the incinerator.
[10744.19s -> 10745.19s]  What is it?
[10745.19s -> 10746.19s]  I'll let him get away.
[10746.19s -> 10747.19s]  What is it? It's a shoe.
[10747.19s -> 10748.19s]  We need this guy to make the clean.
[10748.19s -> 10750.19s]  He's incinerating his shoes.
[10750.19s -> 10757.00s]  No time for that.
[10757.00s -> 10770.84s]  Can I get on the tricycle?
[10770.84s -> 10773.84s]  Jay's asking him on the tricycle.
[10773.84s -> 10788.97s]  Enough running, Hugo.
[10788.97s -> 10789.97s]  Hands up.
[10789.97s -> 10790.97s]  That's what we can see them.
[10790.97s -> 10797.69s]  Turns out it was just like a turkey.
[10797.69s -> 10807.18s]  No, you don't understand. I was trying to cook the shoes. Leather. It's beef.
[10807.18s -> 10810.89s]  This doesn't look good, Hugo.
[10810.89s -> 10813.52s]  I can explain the blood.
[10813.52s -> 10817.23s]  Get him booked in at Central, officer.
[10817.23s -> 10819.23s]  Then put him in an interview room.
[10819.23s -> 10821.23s]  Where's the shoes? The shoes did it.
[10821.23s -> 10823.23s]  Yes, sir, detective.
[10823.23s -> 10825.47s]  Is there someone you can call, Miss?
[10825.47s -> 10827.47s]  I don't...
[10827.47s -> 10828.47s]  No one's home and...
[10828.47s -> 10830.47s]  You need somewhere to stay, Michelle.
[10830.47s -> 10833.47s]  You have other family? Grandparents? Aunt's or uncle?
[10833.47s -> 10836.47s]  Call Aunt Helen, but she lives in Acres Field and...
[10836.47s -> 10837.47s]  Call her.
[10837.47s -> 10841.47s]  We're going to get someone down here from Juvenile Hall to talk to you in the meantime.
[10841.47s -> 10843.47s]  Juvenile Hall?
[10843.47s -> 10845.47s]  We ought to get some uniforms down here.
[10845.47s -> 10847.47s]  Why are we sending her to Juvenile Hall?
[10847.47s -> 10848.47s]  To take care of the kid.
[10848.47s -> 10849.47s]  What?
[10849.47s -> 10858.92s]  It would take a smarter man than me to connect that.
[10858.92s -> 10873.10s]  Start playing the violin.
[10877.73s -> 10880.73s]  Oh, that's evil. That's not okay.
[10880.73s -> 10883.73s]  Thank you for your assistance. Bye.
[10883.73s -> 10889.84s]  Telephone. I need a phone.
[10889.84s -> 10895.15s]  Operator, give me dispatch.
[10895.15s -> 10896.15s]  Putting you through now.
[10896.15s -> 10901.14s]  At first I thought the phone wasn't connected.
[10901.14s -> 10903.57s]  Phelps, 1247.
[10903.57s -> 10908.95s]  Help, detective.
[10908.95s -> 10911.25s]  I need an address on a Belmont High School.
[10911.25s -> 10912.25s]  That's not it.
[10912.25s -> 10914.25s]  Checking for you, detective.
[10914.25s -> 10922.72s]  Thanks for your help.
[10922.72s -> 10926.05s]  Nice made-up name. Told you.
[10926.05s -> 10929.05s]  Oh, wait, that's not it?
[10929.05s -> 10934.30s]  Didn't we just arrest the guy?
[10934.30s -> 10936.30s]  Homicide Division, badge number 564.
[10936.30s -> 10937.30s]  Go ahead.
[10939.82s -> 10941.82s]  Did we get Ray Pinker and a technical services team
[10941.82s -> 10944.82s]  to a house at 130 North Bonnie Blay Street?
[10944.82s -> 10946.82s]  Send someone down to Juvenile Hall
[10946.82s -> 10949.82s]  to look after a young lady.
[10949.82s -> 10955.20s]  What if I just tossed the notebook out the window?
[10955.20s -> 10965.69s]  I don't need any more evidence.
[10965.69s -> 10968.69s]  Oh, fuck, I did leave mine. Whatever.
[10968.69s -> 10978.10s]  No harm done.
[10978.10s -> 10982.73s]  Are they trying to get to me?
[10982.73s -> 10983.73s]  Why won't I pick up the radio?
[10983.73s -> 10985.73s]  I won't pick the radio up.
[10988.10s -> 10991.10s]  Sorry, I can't reach the radio.
[10991.10s -> 10996.80s]  Uh-oh, he's gone rogue.
[10996.80s -> 11003.71s]  I'm on my own time now.
[11003.71s -> 11017.47s]  I'll take care of this myself.
[11017.47s -> 11021.18s]  One hot dog, please!
[11023.87s -> 11026.07s]  What? What do I have to do?
[11026.07s -> 11028.07s]  Do I have to get ice cream?
[11038.65s -> 11039.65s]  One of them was assaulted.
[11039.65s -> 11042.65s]  Yeah! Yeah!
[11042.65s -> 11052.55s]  Do I have to go get my partner?
[11052.55s -> 11058.29s]  You're a great crowd.
[11058.29s -> 11060.29s]  Do I actually have to answer the radio
[11060.29s -> 11061.29s]  before I can come here?
[11061.29s -> 11068.08s]  God damn it. Okay.
[11068.08s -> 11070.70s]  Yeah.
[11070.70s -> 11074.91s]  Nope. All right.
[11075.91s -> 11077.91s]  Okay.
[11083.72s -> 11085.72s]  Is it all seed at the bottom?
[11085.72s -> 11087.72s]  This is going to be disgusting.
[11091.72s -> 11094.63s]  Who the hell is this?
[11094.63s -> 11096.63s]  Why are we chasing this person?
[11096.63s -> 11101.24s]  Watch out for the kids smoking weed under here.
[11101.24s -> 11105.08s]  Or cigarettes, either or.
[11106.08s -> 11126.24s]  You. You.
[11126.24s -> 11127.55s]  Oh, that wasn't you.
[11127.55s -> 11128.55s]  That wasn't you.
[11128.55s -> 11129.55s]  It's you.
[11129.55s -> 11130.55s]  Quick.
[11130.55s -> 11149.47s]  And he's slowing down, slowing down, slowing down.
[11149.47s -> 11153.47s]  Just enough for me to get him.
[11153.47s -> 11166.84s]  Scripted.
[11166.84s -> 11170.75s]  Who is this guy?
[11170.75s -> 11174.48s]  11K, go ahead.
[11174.48s -> 11175.48s]  Really?
[11175.48s -> 11193.28s]  What's your name?
[11193.28s -> 11195.28s]  So we got him.
[11195.28s -> 11197.59s]  Who's asking?
[11197.59s -> 11200.89s]  We can do this the easy way or the hard way.
[11200.89s -> 11202.89s]  Name's Eli Rooney.
[11202.89s -> 11204.89s]  You've been in trouble with the law before, Eli?
[11204.89s -> 11205.89s]  Some.
[11205.89s -> 11206.89s]  What are you doing around here?
[11206.89s -> 11208.89s]  I like to keep an eye on the children.
[11208.89s -> 11210.89s]  Strictly paternal, is it, Eli?
[11210.89s -> 11212.89s]  Don't sass me, boy.
[11212.89s -> 11214.89s]  A woman was abducted here last night, Eli, and murdered.
[11214.89s -> 11217.89s]  And I would love to make you for that, you low-key motherfucker.
[11217.89s -> 11220.89s]  Well, I wouldn't know nothing about that.
[11220.89s -> 11222.89s]  A woman, you say?
[11222.89s -> 11225.13s]  I like them a little younger than that.
[11225.13s -> 11226.13s]  Turn out your pockets, Eli.
[11226.13s -> 11228.13s]  Why would I do that?
[11228.13s -> 11232.13s]  Because I'm about to break your fucking skull, Eli.
[11232.13s -> 11235.20s]  What the fuck is wrong with you?
[11235.20s -> 11237.20s]  You're under arrest, Eli.
[11237.20s -> 11239.20s]  You're in very deep trouble.
[11239.20s -> 11240.20s]  It's a brooch.
[11240.20s -> 11241.20s]  Get some backup down here, Rusty.
[11241.20s -> 11244.20s]  We need to get this one downtown and into a cell.
[11244.20s -> 11245.20s]  Okay.
[11245.20s -> 11246.20s]  I'll tell them.
[11246.20s -> 11253.71s]  So wait, that means, all right, so what about the other guy?
[11253.71s -> 11260.15s]  What time did you see the person park the car?
[11260.15s -> 11264.15s]  Late last night, after school social, maybe 1 a.m.
[11264.15s -> 11266.32s]  Let me keep it a good eye out lately.
[11266.32s -> 11268.32s]  We've had problems with the child molester.
[11268.32s -> 11270.32s]  Eli Rooney, we've met him.
[11270.32s -> 11272.32s]  Filthy son of a bitch.
[11272.32s -> 11273.32s]  Excuse me?
[11273.32s -> 11275.32s]  He was here yesterday before the dance.
[11275.32s -> 11276.32s]  Was it him you saw park the car?
[11276.32s -> 11277.32s]  I don't know, sir.
[11277.32s -> 11278.32s]  I'm not pressing any buttons.
[11278.32s -> 11279.32s]  It's just going quick.
[11279.32s -> 11281.32s]  I'd like to say yes, but the truth is, it was pretty dark.
[11281.32s -> 11283.32s]  Would you say Rooney is violent?
[11283.32s -> 11284.32s]  Yes, sir.
[11284.32s -> 11286.32s]  I would say so, yes.
[11286.32s -> 11288.32s]  Thanks for your help.
[11288.32s -> 11302.66s]  Oh, okay.
[11302.66s -> 11308.44s]  Wow.
[11308.44s -> 11310.58s]  This is the car?
[11310.58s -> 11311.58s]  Yes, sir, detective.
[11311.58s -> 11312.58s]  Have you looked it over?
[11312.58s -> 11313.58s]  Superficially.
[11313.58s -> 11316.08s]  I was told to wait for you guys.
[11316.08s -> 11317.08s]  Thanks.
[11317.08s -> 11318.08s]  We'll take it from here.
[11318.08s -> 11319.08s]  Okay.
[11319.08s -> 11322.25s]  Well, I wonder what this stuff is for.
[11322.25s -> 11323.25s]  Right.
[11323.25s -> 11325.25s]  Blood and skin samples.
[11325.25s -> 11327.25s]  We better get Ray Pinker out here.
[11327.25s -> 11332.05s]  Just some bloody stuff.
[11332.05s -> 11334.05s]  The overalls are stenciled HM.
[11334.05s -> 11335.05s]  The motor is a mechanic.
[11335.05s -> 11338.30s]  I wonder what Eli does for a living.
[11338.30s -> 11347.71s]  It's from a Chrysler.
[11347.71s -> 11350.78s]  Could be important.
[11350.78s -> 11352.78s]  Chrysler, tire, iron.
[11353.78s -> 11360.63s]  Anybody have a phone?
[11360.63s -> 11368.65s]  No evidence in here.
[11368.65s -> 11370.65s]  Time to call it a night.
[11370.65s -> 11388.38s]  Phelps, batch 1247.
[11388.38s -> 11391.28s]  Detective?
[11391.28s -> 11393.28s]  I need interrogations set up at Central
[11393.28s -> 11395.28s]  for both suspects being held in the Mahler homicide case.
[11395.28s -> 11397.28s]  Oh, we've got to figure this shit out, then.
[11397.28s -> 11398.28s]  Certainly, detective.
[11398.28s -> 11400.28s]  I'll get in touch with the watch commander.
[11400.28s -> 11401.28s]  Thank you.
[11401.28s -> 11407.03s]  Interrogation time.
[11407.03s -> 11409.03s]  I'm not very good at these.
[11409.03s -> 11420.16s]  Is there something wrong with this car?
[11420.16s -> 11424.13s]  I mean...
[11424.13s -> 11427.08s]  I can't...
[11427.08s -> 11430.02s]  I guess so.
[11436.23s -> 11443.59s]  Get out.
[11443.59s -> 11445.59s]  I did not do that.
[11445.59s -> 11448.98s]  I say we make Rooney for this.
[11448.98s -> 11450.98s]  I think we should lay it on him.
[11450.98s -> 11452.98s]  More at the police station.
[11452.98s -> 11454.98s]  The DA will love him for it.
[11454.98s -> 11456.98s]  Even if he didn't do it?
[11456.98s -> 11458.98s]  Who cares whether he did it?
[11458.98s -> 11460.98s]  You have kids, Phelps.
[11460.98s -> 11462.98s]  He needs to be taken permanently out of harm's way.
[11462.98s -> 11464.98s]  And we let Mueller slide?
[11464.98s -> 11466.98s]  For a while.
[11466.98s -> 11468.98s]  He gets a free pass for now.
[11468.98s -> 11473.57s]  I don't know about Mueller. My gut says Mueller.
[11473.57s -> 11475.57s]  We caught him trying to destroy evidence in his backyard.
[11475.57s -> 11477.57s]  And that was his car with the bloody tools in it.
[11477.57s -> 11479.57s]  I never said it wasn't Mueller.
[11479.57s -> 11481.57s]  Hell, he probably killed his wife,
[11481.57s -> 11483.57s]  deprived that poor kid of a mother.
[11483.57s -> 11485.57s]  But he's not in immediate danger
[11485.57s -> 11487.57s]  to anyone else.
[11487.57s -> 11489.57s]  Rooney's a threat to every kid at Bethel.
[11489.57s -> 11491.57s]  He's a peeper, Rusty.
[11491.57s -> 11493.57s]  We could pick him up for something else.
[11493.57s -> 11495.57s]  Do we want to run that risk?
[11495.57s -> 11498.71s]  Why don't we just fuse them together
[11498.71s -> 11500.71s]  and then try them at the same time?
[11507.81s -> 11525.09s]  The court system is so backed up.
[11525.09s -> 11529.44s]  Just get them to like a
[11529.44s -> 11531.44s]  lab mad scientist lair
[11531.44s -> 11533.44s]  and turn them into Goro.
[11548.31s -> 11552.85s]  Epic gamer reference.
[11552.85s -> 11564.74s]  Hey, nevermind.
[11564.74s -> 11566.74s]  Massive ethical nightmare.
[11566.74s -> 11585.28s]  Wow!
[11585.28s -> 11587.28s]  Let's go to the morgue and let's take a look at some clues
[11587.28s -> 11589.28s]  and evidence
[11589.28s -> 11591.84s]  and find out
[11591.84s -> 11593.84s]  who's the bad guy.
[11608.10s -> 11610.10s]  Why is the morgue in elementary school?
[11610.10s -> 11615.48s]  Alright, what do we do with...
[11615.48s -> 11620.85s]  Hey, that's not the morgue, doctor.
[11620.85s -> 11624.44s]  Viewing gallery?
[11624.44s -> 11631.27s]  Staff only?
[11631.27s -> 11633.27s]  Oh, look.
[11637.27s -> 11639.27s]  I think he's any kind of doctor.
[11643.27s -> 11645.27s]  Correct.
[11645.27s -> 11656.79s]  Take a look at the samples on the bench.
[11656.79s -> 11676.93s]  What am I doing?
[11676.93s -> 11679.81s]  Oh, I need to... Okay.
[11679.81s -> 11681.81s]  Well, it's definitely not the finger trap one.
[11681.81s -> 11689.11s]  It's probably this one.
[11694.42s -> 11696.42s]  This is a baby's puzzle?
[11696.42s -> 11698.42s]  I didn't know it was a puzzle!
[11698.42s -> 11700.42s]  He just said, there are three things there.
[11700.42s -> 11703.48s]  Look at them.
[11703.48s -> 11705.48s]  Come on!
[11705.48s -> 11707.48s]  I didn't know what I was doing until I looked at it
[11707.48s -> 11709.48s]  for a second.
[11719.72s -> 11721.72s]  God, I get like
[11721.72s -> 11723.72s]  one and a half, two seconds to figure out
[11723.72s -> 11725.72s]  what I need to do with a thing I've never seen?
[11725.72s -> 11727.72s]  Come on!
[11727.72s -> 11732.84s]  I'm not superhuman!
[11732.84s -> 11738.47s]  What's this?
[11738.47s -> 11747.73s]  What else you got?
[11747.73s -> 11749.73s]  Drink everything in the cabinet.
[11749.73s -> 11759.46s]  Oh, these are clay.
[11759.46s -> 11766.55s]  Dinosaurs.
[11766.55s -> 11768.55s]  Let's see, which one of these is the T-Rex?
[11768.55s -> 11783.97s]  Am I supposed to
[11783.97s -> 11789.80s]  touch them?
[11789.80s -> 11791.80s]  That's it.
[11799.80s -> 11804.66s]  Well, thank you, doctor.
[11804.66s -> 11807.22s]  You've been a lot of help.
[11813.65s -> 11827.40s]  Okay. Thank you, doctor.
[11827.40s -> 11834.82s]  Okay. Bye.
[11834.82s -> 11841.35s]  Go get the nail gun?
[11841.35s -> 11845.06s]  Yeah, that's a really bad sweeping technique.
[11845.06s -> 11847.06s]  That's just gonna put it in the air and make everybody start sneezing.
[11847.06s -> 11862.02s]  Okay.
[11862.02s -> 11869.12s]  Police station time.
[11873.12s -> 11875.12s]  Did you have a red light?
[11875.12s -> 11877.12s]  I had a red light.
[11877.12s -> 11880.13s]  Have we got engine noises back? That's a good thing.
[11886.13s -> 11888.13s]  Funny job, that.
[11888.13s -> 11890.13s]  Corners.
[11890.13s -> 11892.13s]  Not even a scratch.
[11896.13s -> 11898.13s]  Small scratch.
[11908.13s -> 11913.25s]  We've played enough missions where I know
[11913.25s -> 11915.25s]  that if you just get close, it's gonna be fine.
[11915.25s -> 11922.80s]  Charge the suspects with murder.
[11924.98s -> 11926.98s]  Evidence rusty. Let him do the rest.
[11926.98s -> 11930.44s]  Okay.
[11930.44s -> 11932.68s]  Interview room one, interview room two.
[11932.68s -> 11934.68s]  Are they ready?
[11934.68s -> 11936.68s]  Bowler's in two and the pervert's in one.
[11936.68s -> 11938.85s]  Get in there and get a conviction.
[11938.85s -> 11940.85s]  Hey, you think those vice boys
[11940.85s -> 11945.01s]  get any on the side?
[11945.01s -> 11947.64s]  Alright, where is it?
[11947.64s -> 11959.22s]  Interview room two.
[11959.22s -> 11961.40s]  Who's in here?
[11961.40s -> 11963.40s]  Your next door neighbor heard screaming
[11963.40s -> 11965.40s]  coming from your house.
[11965.40s -> 11967.40s]  You were burning your blood-stained shoes.
[11967.40s -> 11969.40s]  You can confirm your whereabouts last night.
[11969.40s -> 11971.40s]  Your daughter says you're a violent man.
[11971.40s -> 11973.40s]  We have everything we need to send you to death row.
[11973.40s -> 11975.40s]  And all you have to say for yourself
[11975.40s -> 11978.40s]  is I didn't do it.
[11978.40s -> 11980.40s]  I swear I didn't kill her.
[11980.40s -> 11982.40s]  Give me that lie test. I can prove it.
[11982.40s -> 11985.60s]  The lie test.
[11985.60s -> 11989.83s]  Give me the lie test.
[11989.83s -> 11991.83s]  Why did you burn your shoes, Hugo?
[11991.83s -> 11993.83s]  This is what I don't understand.
[11993.83s -> 12000.48s]  Because I knew you'd never believe me.
[12000.48s -> 12002.48s]  I mean, what?
[12002.48s -> 12009.72s]  Why did you do that? Because you wouldn't believe me.
[12009.72s -> 12011.72s]  Are you going to tell me what I want to know?
[12011.72s -> 12015.68s]  Or do we have to take it out of you in lumps?
[12015.68s -> 12017.68s]  You're at your best shot.
[12017.68s -> 12019.86s]  I can take whatever you're throwing.
[12019.86s -> 12021.86s]  Do you know anything about ropes, Hugo?
[12021.86s -> 12026.53s]  As much as the next man?
[12026.53s -> 12028.96s]  I was a scout.
[12028.96s -> 12031.78s]  I learned some more in the army.
[12031.78s -> 12033.78s]  Do we have anything?
[12033.78s -> 12043.57s]  Can I look at those rope?
[12043.57s -> 12057.84s]  You learned to strangle with the rope in the army?
[12057.84s -> 12059.84s]  We've got a bad cop, this guy.
[12059.84s -> 12061.84s]  With rope, with my bare hands,
[12061.84s -> 12063.84s]  but mainly with wire.
[12063.84s -> 12066.28s]  I learned a lot of things in the army,
[12066.28s -> 12068.28s]  but I still didn't kill my wife.
[12068.28s -> 12070.28s]  For argument's sake,
[12070.28s -> 12072.28s]  what type of rope would you use?
[12072.28s -> 12074.28s]  If I had to, I would use a triple braid.
[12074.28s -> 12076.28s]  Less flex, easier to control.
[12076.28s -> 12078.28s]  That's what it was.
[12078.28s -> 12081.28s]  That's what it was.
[12081.28s -> 12083.28s]  That's what it was. He just said the thing that it was.
[12083.28s -> 12087.51s]  We found your wife's car.
[12087.51s -> 12089.51s]  Someone parked it at the school late last night.
[12089.51s -> 12091.51s]  Do you have anything to say about that?
[12091.51s -> 12093.75s]  It wasn't me.
[12093.75s -> 12096.82s]  Where do you keep your work clothes?
[12096.82s -> 12099.57s]  I keep them at work in my locker.
[12099.57s -> 12104.76s]  Wait, where?
[12104.76s -> 12113.83s]  That was in the trunk.
[12113.83s -> 12115.83s]  You killed your wife in cold blood.
[12115.83s -> 12117.83s]  You're f-
[12117.83s -> 12119.83s]  Enough lies, Hugo.
[12119.83s -> 12122.32s]  Your overalls put you at the scene of the crime last night.
[12122.32s -> 12124.32s]  My overalls are in the laundry of my house.
[12124.32s -> 12126.32s]  Oh, well.
[12126.32s -> 12128.32s]  That evidence begs to differ
[12128.32s -> 12130.32s]  unless somebody faked it.
[12130.32s -> 12132.32s]  Green overalls, blood stained,
[12132.32s -> 12134.32s]  with the initials HM
[12134.32s -> 12136.32s]  found in the trunk of your wife's car.
[12136.32s -> 12139.20s]  They can't be mine.
[12139.20s -> 12141.20s]  Why, Hugo?
[12141.20s -> 12143.20s]  Because if they were yours, they'd be in the incinerator, too?
[12143.20s -> 12145.20s]  Because if they were yours, they'd be in the incinerator, too?
[12145.20s -> 12151.60s]  Your wife was beaten with a tire iron, Hugo.
[12151.60s -> 12153.60s]  An appropriate choice of tool for a mechanic.
[12153.60s -> 12155.60s]  An appropriate choice of tool for a mechanic.
[12155.60s -> 12157.60s]  I know nothing about any tire iron.
[12157.60s -> 12159.60s]  We just picked it up.
[12159.60s -> 12161.60s]  It was in the trunk, right?
[12161.60s -> 12166.21s]  Tire iron stained with blood
[12166.21s -> 12168.21s]  found in the trunk of
[12168.21s -> 12170.21s]  Muller's vehicle.
[12170.21s -> 12175.40s]  You're lying, Hugo.
[12175.40s -> 12177.40s]  You have to come clean on this.
[12177.40s -> 12179.40s]  I can take whatever you throw at me.
[12179.40s -> 12185.48s]  Put those feet up here.
[12185.48s -> 12188.55s]  Your wife drove a Chevrolet, Hugo.
[12188.55s -> 12190.55s]  What make of car do you drive?
[12190.55s -> 12193.30s]  Chrysler Airflow.
[12193.30s -> 12195.54s]  So I guess that explains why
[12195.54s -> 12197.54s]  the tire iron that killed your wife came from a Chrysler.
[12197.54s -> 12202.85s]  He did it.
[12208.42s -> 12210.42s]  You dared the crime.
[12210.42s -> 12212.42s]  You got the bloody tire iron. Your bloody clothes are in the trunk.
[12212.42s -> 12219.27s]  Check. Wait, wait, what?
[12219.27s -> 12221.89s]  Interrogate the other guy.
[12221.89s -> 12224.71s]  Oh, that's right. There's another person.
[12224.71s -> 12227.01s]  Do I, what? Do I have to like make a choice now though?
[12227.01s -> 12229.89s]  If I leave this, is it like,
[12229.89s -> 12231.89s]  ah, you fucked it up again, Phelps.
[12231.89s -> 12233.89s]  Like it happened before. Can I leave?
[12233.89s -> 12252.95s]  Okay.
[12252.95s -> 12254.95s]  Where is the other guy? I'm assuming he's in the other interview room.
[12254.95s -> 12259.62s]  Which is
[12259.62s -> 12263.19s]  where? Over here.
[12263.19s -> 12265.62s]  Captain, we were on our way to interview Eli Rooney.
[12265.62s -> 12267.62s]  Captain, we were on our way to interview Eli Rooney.
[12267.62s -> 12270.12s]  Yes, Phelps, I know.
[12270.12s -> 12272.12s]  This particular fiend is an old acquaintance.
[12272.12s -> 12274.12s]  An old acquaintance? Equations?
[12274.12s -> 12276.12s]  He believes in a wrathful and terrible god.
[12276.12s -> 12278.42s]  Whichever way it goes,
[12278.42s -> 12281.43s]  he'd deal him personally.
[12281.43s -> 12287.81s]  What? Oh.
[12287.81s -> 12290.56s]  Okay.
[12290.56s -> 12292.80s]  You look like you've had it rough.
[12292.80s -> 12294.80s]  You see me asking for your sympathy, boy?
[12294.80s -> 12297.88s]  Ah,
[12297.88s -> 12300.63s]  fuck, hold on.
[12300.63s -> 12308.44s]  This is all we have.
[12308.44s -> 12312.02s]  You're down on your luck, Eli.
[12312.02s -> 12314.02s]  I had worse.
[12314.02s -> 12316.02s]  My family a roadkill during the Dust Bowl.
[12316.02s -> 12318.02s]  But you have a job. A parolee has to have a job, correct?
[12318.02s -> 12320.02s]  I have me a job down in San Pedro.
[12320.02s -> 12322.02s]  I'm looking for something new.
[12322.02s -> 12324.32s]  This place you worked have a name?
[12324.32s -> 12340.84s]  Hennessey Marine.
[12340.84s -> 12342.84s]  I don't like that.
[12342.84s -> 12344.84s]  This place, big yellow letters, HML.
[12344.84s -> 12346.84s]  This game's hard.
[12346.84s -> 12348.84s]  They give you any work wear, Eli?
[12348.84s -> 12350.84s]  Sure.
[12350.84s -> 12352.84s]  Green cover off.
[12352.84s -> 12354.84s]  Yeah, I know he has the brooch, but so?
[12354.84s -> 12359.64s]  You ever tie up any of your victims, Eli?
[12359.64s -> 12361.64s]  You ever tie up any of your victims, Eli?
[12361.64s -> 12363.81s]  It's not a nice thing to go calling them.
[12363.81s -> 12366.18s]  What would you call them?
[12366.18s -> 12368.48s]  Calling them.
[12368.48s -> 12371.24s]  I can't say.
[12371.24s -> 12373.24s]  I learned a long time ago not to go talking about the things I like.
[12373.24s -> 12375.24s]  What?
[12375.24s -> 12377.24s]  Talking about it just seems to get people's dander up.
[12377.24s -> 12379.24s]  Answer the goddamn question, Rudy, before I brain you.
[12379.24s -> 12381.24s]  See what I mean?
[12381.24s -> 12383.54s]  Short answer is yes.
[12383.54s -> 12385.54s]  You have any preference regarding rope, Eli?
[12385.54s -> 12387.54s]  I know a good rope from a bad rope,
[12387.54s -> 12389.54s]  but that's what you mean.
[12389.54s -> 12392.23s]  That's not what you mean, is it?
[12392.23s -> 12395.49s]  Any old rope will do me fine.
[12395.49s -> 12399.65s]  That's not true.
[12399.65s -> 12403.75s]  This is a special rope, right?
[12403.75s -> 12413.67s]  This is a special rope would require
[12413.67s -> 12415.67s]  because it was the braided rope.
[12415.67s -> 12417.67s]  Because it was the braided rope.
[12417.67s -> 12440.07s]  A long boy like you, Eli, must prefer...
[12440.07s -> 12442.07s]  Don't give me the answers! Stop!
[12442.07s -> 12444.07s]  I prefer braids,
[12444.07s -> 12446.07s]  until I hitch a braid.
[12446.07s -> 12449.97s]  Okay, listen.
[12449.97s -> 12451.97s]  You can always tell when I'm like
[12451.97s -> 12453.97s]  nervous and waiting.
[12453.97s -> 12455.97s]  When I think a long time,
[12455.97s -> 12457.97s]  I'm like, what is this jacket? Is it correct?
[12457.97s -> 12463.22s]  What's the motive?
[12463.22s -> 12465.22s]  You killed Mrs. Muller and stole her jewelry.
[12465.22s -> 12467.91s]  That ain't so. Ain't nothing like that.
[12467.91s -> 12470.79s]  Bullshit.
[12470.79s -> 12472.79s]  I can accuse this, right?
[12472.79s -> 12477.14s]  Because of the brooch. He has the brooch.
[12477.14s -> 12480.79s]  He stole the brooch.
[12480.79s -> 12482.79s]  You're a liar, Eli. You needed the money,
[12482.79s -> 12485.35s]  so you killed her.
[12485.35s -> 12487.52s]  I've been around some, son.
[12487.52s -> 12489.52s]  You got some evidence to prove I stole that
[12489.52s -> 12491.52s]  butterfly from that woman?
[12491.52s -> 12499.72s]  I don't think I have evidence of that.
[12499.72s -> 12504.52s]  I done told you I found that pretty thing.
[12504.52s -> 12506.82s]  I never stole it.
[12506.82s -> 12515.84s]  What size boot do you wear, Eli?
[12515.84s -> 12517.84s]  It's all about the feet.
[12517.84s -> 12520.72s]  Kind of like anything I can get my hands on.
[12520.72s -> 12522.72s]  I'm wearing elevens.
[12522.72s -> 12525.22s]  Oh, really? Put them up here.
[12525.22s -> 12527.22s]  There may be five-five, five-six tops.
[12527.22s -> 12529.22s]  And you wear size elevens?
[12529.22s -> 12531.22s]  I don't think so, Eli.
[12531.22s -> 12533.22s]  That might be on the large side.
[12533.22s -> 12535.22s]  Maybe tens. Maybe eights.
[12535.22s -> 12537.22s]  Now that I've come to think of it.
[12537.22s -> 12539.22s]  Why punish children with your iniquity, Eli?
[12539.22s -> 12541.84s]  You think I was never punished?
[12541.84s -> 12544.66s]  You must know what you're doing is evil.
[12544.66s -> 12546.90s]  Well, son.
[12546.90s -> 12549.91s]  Nobody's perfect.
[12549.91s -> 12565.44s]  But, can I look at my book?
[12565.44s -> 12567.44s]  You're as good as done, Mr. Rooney.
[12567.44s -> 12569.44s]  All it will take now is some paperwork.
[12569.44s -> 12575.38s]  What happened? Did I take too long?
[12575.38s -> 12588.88s]  What? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
[12588.88s -> 12590.88s]  Did I, I pressed,
[12590.88s -> 12592.88s]  I tried to look at my, I pressed the middle
[12592.88s -> 12597.68s]  PlayStation thing.
[12597.68s -> 12606.71s]  Oh, shit. Okay.
[12606.71s -> 12608.71s]  The other guy has so much evidence against him.
[12608.71s -> 12612.23s]  But he keeps on going like,
[12612.23s -> 12614.23s]  That's what I do and I like it.
[12614.23s -> 12616.23s]  Like, what? How do we, how do I know
[12616.23s -> 12618.23s]  that he's just not murdering other people?
[12618.23s -> 12620.60s]  But the other guy may have murdered.
[12620.60s -> 12625.33s]  Eli Rooney, I'm charging you
[12625.33s -> 12627.33s]  with the first degree murder of Deirdre Muller.
[12627.33s -> 12629.33s]  You don't want to put me back
[12629.33s -> 12631.33s]  if I stir that badly, boy. You go ahead and try.
[12631.33s -> 12633.33s]  It's wrong. I'll beat that rat.
[12633.33s -> 12635.33s]  I ain't a killer. It's wrong.
[12635.33s -> 12638.60s]  Phelps, nice work.
[12638.60s -> 12657.86s]  You fucked it up.
[12657.86s -> 12660.42s]  Did I do it? Is there a, does it tell you
[12660.42s -> 12662.42s]  if you did it wrong?
[12662.42s -> 12664.42s]  Wrong person.
[12671.04s -> 12673.04s]  You lost.
[12679.04s -> 12681.86s]  Did I?
[12681.86s -> 12683.86s]  Will we never know?
[12683.86s -> 12693.96s]  I'll take it.
[12693.96s -> 12696.20s]  That's fine.
[12696.20s -> 12701.12s]  That's a good C minus.
[12701.12s -> 12703.12s]  He was innocent of the murder, but he was a weirdo.
[12703.12s -> 12706.20s]  Hawkeye,
[12706.20s -> 12708.20s]  Hawkeye of mine just came in with
[12708.20s -> 12711.78s]  $35.
[12711.78s -> 12713.78s]  Thank you so much, Hawkeye.
[12713.78s -> 12716.02s]  You say, listen to me, son. I'm your dad.
[12716.02s -> 12718.90s]  Destroy him. Thank you.
[12718.90s -> 12721.40s]  Thank you so much, dude.
[12721.40s -> 12738.15s]  They were both innocent.
[12738.15s -> 12740.15s]  Phelps, we kept your two regular armies.
[12740.15s -> 12742.15s]  Lieutenant, Phelps, we've been over this.
[12742.15s -> 12744.15s]  That sniper barely missed you back on the beach.
[12744.15s -> 12746.15s]  Until the mission is over, there'll be no more saluting
[12746.15s -> 12748.15s]  or signs of rape. I'm in charge here, Medier.
[12748.15s -> 12750.15s]  Do you wish to interrogate the prisoners?
[12750.15s -> 12755.20s]  They're beat.
[12755.20s -> 12757.20s]  Why do they look so sullen?
[12757.20s -> 12759.20s]  Wondering why we haven't killed them yet.
[12759.20s -> 12761.20s]  There's no greater shame than being taken prisoner.
[12761.20s -> 12763.20s]  Get this golden boy. I just seem to
[12763.20s -> 12765.20s]  know what he's doing.
[12773.20s -> 12775.20s]  See that, boys? He slapped that Jap right upside the head.
[12775.20s -> 12777.20s]  General wants us to backseat.
[12777.20s -> 12779.20s]  No, I don't.
[12779.20s -> 12781.20s]  But I do. But I don't.
[12781.20s -> 12783.20s]  I respect the Japanese, Corporal.
[12783.20s -> 12785.20s]  Respect? We're here to kill
[12785.20s -> 12787.20s]  the sons of bitches.
[12787.20s -> 12789.20s]  Do you know why we're fighting the Japanese, Private?
[12789.20s -> 12791.20s]  With respect, sir, these bastards
[12791.20s -> 12793.20s]  attacked Pearl Harbor.
[12793.20s -> 12795.20s]  And why did they attack Pearl, Private?
[12795.20s -> 12797.20s]  Because they hate the US of A
[12797.20s -> 12799.20s]  and our way of life.
[12799.20s -> 12801.20s]  They attacked the US because we cut off their oil.
[12801.20s -> 12803.20s]  What would we do if another country denied us
[12803.20s -> 12805.20s]  the gas to run our cars?
[12805.20s -> 12811.60s]  This is, uh...
[12811.60s -> 12816.72s]  Okay.
[12816.72s -> 12819.03s]  The ship-shocking murder!
[12819.03s -> 12829.83s]  I was just discussing with
[12829.83s -> 12831.83s]  Finbar here how well he would do it.
[12831.83s -> 12833.83s]  I want to eat a shitload of bacon right now.
[12833.83s -> 12835.83s]  A ton of it. Like, way too much for my body
[12835.83s -> 12837.83s]  to handle. I'll get sick.
[12837.83s -> 12839.83s]  What?
[12839.83s -> 12841.83s]  You boys have a new case.
[12841.83s -> 12843.83s]  A poor Hispanic woman murdered near City Hall
[12843.83s -> 12845.83s]  and left lying naked in an alleyway.
[12845.83s -> 12848.58s]  Another naked woman, sir?
[12848.58s -> 12850.58s]  Yes. We seem to have had quite a run
[12850.58s -> 12852.58s]  of them since the Dahlia fiends first struck.
[12852.58s -> 12854.58s]  Phelps is politely trying to hint
[12854.58s -> 12856.58s]  that he thinks the 10th is his hope.
[12856.58s -> 12858.58s]  Well, young folks, you win some
[12858.58s -> 12860.58s]  and you lose some in police work.
[12860.58s -> 12862.58s]  You're happy with the location?
[12862.58s -> 12864.58s]  Over the moon, boys!
[12864.58s -> 12866.58s]  You're happy with the location?
[12866.58s -> 12868.58s]  The witness, the witness,
[12868.58s -> 12870.58s]  and the lack of banana.
[12870.58s -> 12874.68s]  Get out there and catch me another listener.
[12887.89s -> 12889.89s]  Murdered on sandwiches! That's what we're gonna do!
[12889.89s -> 12892.52s]  And then it's gone. All of it.
[12892.52s -> 12898.72s]  Alright, we're gonna have
[12898.72s -> 12900.72s]  another naked murder victim.
[12900.72s -> 12903.35s]  You have the address?
[12903.35s -> 12905.35s]  It's the alley off Aliso
[12905.35s -> 12907.35s]  between Los Angeles and Alameda.
[12907.35s -> 12909.35s]  You're kidding. The next one will be opposite Central Station.
[12909.35s -> 12911.35s]  There's been no random crimes.
[12911.35s -> 12913.35s]  I kind of miss them.
[12913.35s -> 12915.35s]  This is really funny.
[12915.35s -> 12917.35s]  Yeah. It means they can pop in
[12917.35s -> 12919.35s]  to hit the office supply of hooch
[12919.35s -> 12921.35s]  whenever they need it.
[12921.35s -> 12923.35s]  Well, that ain't a bad idea.
[12923.35s -> 12925.35s]  That is not a bad idea at all.
[12925.35s -> 12931.43s]  I was told bacon
[12931.43s -> 12933.43s]  is like the same as turkey.
[12933.43s -> 12935.43s]  Oh, and I spoke too soon.
[12937.43s -> 12939.43s]  Um, but...
[12939.43s -> 12944.16s]  Code 3.
[12944.16s -> 12946.16s]  Turkey, turkey, and bacon are, or they're not
[12946.16s -> 12948.16s]  the same. Turkey is
[12948.16s -> 12950.16s]  turkey and bacon is pig.
[12950.16s -> 12952.16s]  You can get
[12952.16s -> 12954.16s]  turkey bacon, which
[12954.16s -> 12956.16s]  tastes good, kind of like shoe leather,
[12956.16s -> 12958.16s]  but it's kind of like jerky
[12958.16s -> 12960.16s]  in a sense. I like it. I sometimes actually
[12960.16s -> 12962.16s]  prefer it.
[12962.16s -> 12965.49s]  Is this the remaster? Yes, it is.
[12965.49s -> 12967.49s]  This is the one that's on PS4.
[12967.49s -> 12977.16s]  I love turkey bacon.
[12977.16s -> 12979.16s]  I love everything turkey. Turkeys are my favorite meat.
[12979.16s -> 12982.23s]  Turkey burgers, turkey bacon,
[12982.23s -> 12984.23s]  turkey patties,
[12984.23s -> 12986.23s]  turkey dinner, turkey breast,
[12986.23s -> 12988.23s]  turkey jerky.
[12988.23s -> 12990.23s]  All good.
[12990.23s -> 12995.41s]  Whatever. Alright, here comes Kenny.
[12995.41s -> 13001.81s]  Oh my god!
[13001.81s -> 13005.20s]  They killed Kenny!
[13011.20s -> 13017.48s]  Clear the roof!
[13017.48s -> 13022.40s]  Ooh, ooh, ooh, he's going!
[13022.40s -> 13038.85s]  Alright, if I get a headshot, I get to eat as much bacon as I want tonight.
[13038.85s -> 13040.85s]  If I get a headshot, I get to eat as much bacon as I want tonight.
[13040.85s -> 13044.44s]  That's the rule, I didn't make it.
[13044.44s -> 13047.06s]  Headshot, I get to eat as much bacon as I want!
[13047.06s -> 13056.47s]  Yes! I get to eat a ton of
[13056.47s -> 13058.77s]  fucking bacon!
[13058.77s -> 13064.58s]  Mmm!
[13064.58s -> 13073.54s]  Yay! Was I not supposed to kill him?
[13073.54s -> 13083.01s]  I think I was supposed to apprehend him.
[13083.01s -> 13086.02s]  But, would you get some
[13086.02s -> 13093.00s]  bacon out of it?
[13093.00s -> 13095.68s]  Killing somebody for bacon.
[13095.68s -> 13097.68s]  Oh my god, wouldn't you kill for bacon though?
[13097.68s -> 13099.68s]  Epic.
[13101.68s -> 13119.60s]  I hate that word.
[13119.60s -> 13121.60s]  If I could delete a word from the English language,
[13121.60s -> 13123.60s]  it would be epic.
[13123.60s -> 13125.60s]  I would delete it.
[13125.60s -> 13134.82s]  I hate the way it sounds.
[13134.82s -> 13136.82s]  I hate how enthusiastically people say it.
[13136.82s -> 13138.82s]  I hate how
[13138.82s -> 13140.82s]  the word replaces every adjective.
[13140.82s -> 13148.29s]  No.
[13148.29s -> 13150.98s]  I didn't even do that.
[13150.98s -> 13162.31s]  I didn't even do that.
[13162.31s -> 13164.31s]  Epic.
[13164.31s -> 13179.40s]  Epic.
[13179.40s -> 13182.02s]  Epic.
[13182.02s -> 13184.32s]  Epic.
[13184.32s -> 13186.56s]  Epic.
[13186.56s -> 13189.44s]  Epic.
[13189.44s -> 13191.94s]  Epic.
[13191.94s -> 13193.94s]  Epic.
[13193.94s -> 13202.45s]  Epic.
[13202.45s -> 13208.21s]  Epic.
[13208.21s -> 13210.21s]  After the cutscene.
[13212.52s -> 13214.52s]  Why is someone naked?
[13214.52s -> 13216.52s]  No one naked.
[13216.52s -> 13218.52s]  Stop killing people and making them be naked!
[13218.52s -> 13220.76s]  Stop this!
[13220.76s -> 13222.76s]  Anyways, look. Let me just show you
[13222.76s -> 13225.70s]  what I'm talking about here.
[13225.70s -> 13227.94s]  That's all seeds down there.
[13227.94s -> 13229.94s]  You don't want to consume this.
[13229.94s -> 13236.08s]  It's just gross.
[13236.08s -> 13238.08s]  It's only seeds.
[13238.08s -> 13245.00s]  It's like a tiny little pond of liquid.
[13245.00s -> 13247.00s]  I won't do it.
[13247.00s -> 13249.00s]  Hey, Cole.
[13249.00s -> 13251.00s]  Let's get moving.
[13262.90s -> 13264.90s]  The lacerations on the neck
[13264.90s -> 13266.90s]  would indicate a great deal of force.
[13276.26s -> 13278.63s]  Only 21 years old.
[13278.63s -> 13280.63s]  But why the library card?
[13280.63s -> 13282.63s]  Did he want us to find it?
[13282.63s -> 13287.94s]  Kiss the blood, BD.
[13294.04s -> 13299.16s]  Other arm.
[13299.16s -> 13301.16s]  Another wedding ring.
[13301.16s -> 13303.46s]  Another wedding ring torn from the finger.
[13303.46s -> 13309.35s]  No skin under the fingernails.
[13309.35s -> 13314.07s]  Okay, good.
[13314.07s -> 13317.08s]  That's it.
[13317.08s -> 13319.08s]  The evidence in the Mueller case was solid.
[13319.08s -> 13321.08s]  I'm not convinced about Mendez.
[13321.08s -> 13323.08s]  The best way to get away with murder is to pin it on somebody else.
[13323.08s -> 13325.08s]  I'll bet a month's salary this is a copycat.
[13325.08s -> 13327.08s]  Strangle, battered, naked.
[13327.08s -> 13329.08s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. We know the MO.
[13329.08s -> 13331.08s]  So does every jerk who kills his wife and girlfriend
[13331.08s -> 13333.08s]  looking for a way out.
[13333.08s -> 13335.32s]  I've spoken to Brown.
[13335.32s -> 13337.32s]  He still believes the Dahlia perp has medical experience.
[13337.32s -> 13339.32s]  Four women, all murdered,
[13339.32s -> 13341.32s]  all put on display,
[13341.32s -> 13343.32s]  all with messages.
[13343.32s -> 13345.32s]  Mueller had no message.
[13345.32s -> 13347.32s]  Look, Phelps, this is getting us nowhere.
[13347.32s -> 13349.32s]  Anything for us to go on, Mel?
[13349.32s -> 13351.32s]  Head injuries from contact with road,
[13351.32s -> 13353.32s]  bruising from a small man's shoe,
[13353.32s -> 13355.32s]  further blunt force trauma to the occipital region
[13355.32s -> 13357.32s]  at the base of the skull.
[13357.32s -> 13359.32s]  Could have been fatal, but
[13359.32s -> 13361.32s]  clear signs of strangulation would seem to rule it out.
[13361.32s -> 13363.32s]  Break the seeds.
[13363.32s -> 13365.32s]  I'm going for it.
[13365.32s -> 13367.32s]  I'll see if I can nail down a brand.
[13367.32s -> 13376.47s]  Don't look over here.
[13376.47s -> 13390.36s]  If she took a blow to the head like the others,
[13390.36s -> 13392.36s]  she was probably unconscious when strangled.
[13392.36s -> 13394.36s]  Okay.
[13394.36s -> 13402.85s]  Fucking epic.
[13402.85s -> 13405.41s]  Is that it? Wait.
[13405.41s -> 13410.85s]  What is it?
[13410.85s -> 13417.38s]  May as well follow the trail.
[13417.38s -> 13423.14s]  Do I need to walk there or what?
[13423.14s -> 13437.16s]  Antonio.
[13437.16s -> 13439.16s]  Same as the library card.
[13439.16s -> 13450.47s]  Okay. That's it.
[13450.47s -> 13455.51s]  Wait, what are you looking at? My help?
[13455.51s -> 13466.63s]  All right, that's it.
[13466.63s -> 13471.30s]  There's blood all over the door.
[13471.30s -> 13473.48s]  Did somebody shot a gun? What was that?
[13473.48s -> 13477.24s]  Oh, he took a picture.
[13477.24s -> 13480.31s]  Nothing in trash cans.
[13480.31s -> 13488.93s]  All right. Wait. Matches.
[13488.93s -> 13492.39s]  Matches are never anything. Ever.
[13492.39s -> 13509.28s]  It's never matches.
[13509.28s -> 13511.28s]  I still feel these seeds in my mouth.
[13511.28s -> 13513.28s]  I'm going to have to go fucking throw up.
[13513.28s -> 13516.34s]  It's rust.
[13516.34s -> 13525.68s]  They're in my teeth.
[13525.68s -> 13527.68s]  It's bad.
[13527.68s -> 13532.87s]  I'm going to smoke blood.
[13532.87s -> 13536.96s]  Okay. Drink water?
[13536.96s -> 13538.96s]  I don't have any water up here. Only seeds.
[13538.96s -> 13549.76s]  Shoo.
[13549.76s -> 13551.76s]  Proximity to the scene plus the blood stains.
[13551.76s -> 13553.76s]  No way is this coincidence.
[13553.76s -> 13557.99s]  Okay.
[13557.99s -> 13560.29s]  Shoo on head.
[13560.29s -> 13562.29s]  I better put this on my head or chat will think it's pre-recorded.
[13562.29s -> 13569.52s]  On it goes.
[13569.52s -> 13579.36s]  With a gun.
[13579.36s -> 13581.36s]  We kept the area pristine for you boys.
[13581.36s -> 13583.36s]  Let's check it out. No pocket.
[13583.36s -> 13586.82s]  Wait, there's a TV dinner over here.
[13586.82s -> 13597.24s]  Nothing.
[13597.24s -> 13604.53s]  Oh, there is a...
[13604.53s -> 13606.53s]  What is this?
[13606.53s -> 13611.46s]  Five house keys
[13611.46s -> 13613.46s]  strung up like bait on a hook.
[13613.46s -> 13623.12s]  That's a huge crime scene.
[13623.12s -> 13625.12s]  Any more blood?
[13625.12s -> 13627.12s]  Blood.
[13627.12s -> 13631.35s]  Blood. Blood.
[13631.35s -> 13638.20s]  It's got to be a code or a cipher.
[13638.20s -> 13640.69s]  Two five three.
[13640.69s -> 13642.69s]  Two five three.
[13642.69s -> 13653.30s]  Memorize that.
[13653.30s -> 13658.04s]  Okay. Climbed about here.
[13658.04s -> 13660.04s]  Where are you taking us?
[13660.04s -> 13662.66s]  Okay. To the roof we go.
[13662.66s -> 13667.27s]  What is on the roof?
[13667.27s -> 13674.05s]  That was record time.
[13674.05s -> 13676.05s]  That was record roof time.
[13676.05s -> 13683.54s]  Blood.
[13683.54s -> 13689.99s]  Blood?
[13689.99s -> 13693.64s]  Blood in the birdcage.
[13693.64s -> 13695.64s]  Now that sounds like a title of a great movie.
[13695.64s -> 13702.34s]  Blood in the birdcage.
[13702.34s -> 13704.52s]  Okay. Mrs. A Maldonado.
[13704.52s -> 13710.34s]  Federal offense.
[13710.34s -> 13712.58s]  Empty.
[13712.58s -> 13714.58s]  Where is all of this meant to be taking us?
[13714.58s -> 13719.06s]  Okay.
[13719.06s -> 13721.06s]  He clearly wants us to find these things.
[13721.06s -> 13724.26s]  He left them for us.
[13724.26s -> 13726.26s]  There you go, Felt. You got a new M.O.
[13726.26s -> 13728.26s]  I told you it would. More blood.
[13728.26s -> 13730.26s]  Or he might just be getting more confident.
[13730.26s -> 13737.03s]  A D.S.
[13737.03s -> 13739.03s]  What do you got on here? An amald and gold plated.
[13739.03s -> 13741.03s]  This was precious to her.
[13741.03s -> 13751.25s]  Can I do anything with this?
[13751.25s -> 13755.09s]  I guess not.
[13755.09s -> 13760.85s]  The trail points up.
[13760.85s -> 13762.85s]  New Super Barrio Brothers D.S.
[13762.85s -> 13766.63s]  Who has this much blood?
[13766.63s -> 13769.19s]  You would have died
[13769.19s -> 13771.19s]  two pipes ago.
[13771.19s -> 13776.76s]  Oh look, another
[13776.76s -> 13778.76s]  wedding ring.
[13778.76s -> 13780.76s]  I'm the wedding ring killer.
[13780.76s -> 13783.32s]  I kill people
[13783.32s -> 13785.32s]  and take off their wedding ring.
[13785.32s -> 13789.54s]  Find me if you can.
[13789.54s -> 13806.69s]  Looks as though the killer was
[13806.69s -> 13808.69s]  decorating with this.
[13810.69s -> 13812.69s]  He's just a sick fuck.
[13812.69s -> 13815.12s]  This is the end of the trail.
[13815.12s -> 13823.75s]  Red bag.
[13823.75s -> 13826.24s]  The other half.
[13826.24s -> 13829.38s]  May 19th, 1929.
[13837.22s -> 13843.04s]  Okay, well we have an address.
[13843.04s -> 13845.04s]  I think that's the end of the trail.
[13845.04s -> 13848.76s]  Yeah, it kind of has to be.
[13848.76s -> 13857.84s]  Bag secured.
[13857.84s -> 13859.84s]  Whoa, that scared the shit out of me.
[13859.84s -> 13864.77s]  God.
[13864.77s -> 13869.68s]  That was like an explosion.
[13873.68s -> 13875.68s]  I'm going to pee again.
[13875.68s -> 13877.68s]  I'm going to be pissing out C.
[13893.68s -> 13897.64s]  Imagine if we didn't have
[13897.64s -> 13899.64s]  intestines and a
[13899.64s -> 13902.39s]  stomach and everything that could
[13902.39s -> 13904.39s]  process all this shit.
[13904.39s -> 13907.59s]  Pissing out, fucking solid.
[13907.59s -> 13913.28s]  Gone.
[13913.28s -> 13927.56s]  Yeah, imagine if you didn't have a stomach.
[13927.56s -> 13929.56s]  No, no, no, not a stomach, but just the way that it separates it.
[13929.56s -> 13931.56s]  You guys don't realize, your body
[13931.56s -> 13933.56s]  is a gigantic coin separation
[13933.56s -> 13935.56s]  machine. You know when those old machines
[13935.56s -> 13937.56s]  you put in the dime, the nickel, the quarter
[13937.56s -> 13939.56s]  and it would go, and put it in the right slot?
[13939.56s -> 13941.56s]  If your body didn't have one of those down
[13941.56s -> 13943.56s]  there, you'd be in a lot of trouble.
[13943.56s -> 13948.55s]  But the weird thing though is, even those
[13948.55s -> 13950.55s]  machines, sometimes you'd put like a penny in
[13950.55s -> 13952.55s]  and it would fuck up and go in the quarter slot.
[13952.55s -> 13954.55s]  So why are our bodies so good at it?
[13954.55s -> 13957.88s]  How come a nickel
[13957.88s -> 13959.88s]  doesn't go into the dime slot sometimes?
[13959.88s -> 13961.88s]  If you catch my drift.
[13961.88s -> 13976.20s]  Sometimes I read
[13976.20s -> 13978.20s]  the one comment that makes me laugh.
[13978.20s -> 13981.08s]  Are you this stupid on purpose?
[13998.47s -> 14001.22s]  I'm here. Which one's Kenny?
[14006.23s -> 14008.23s]  Well, Kenny's not here.
[14008.23s -> 14010.23s]  It's not the default police officer.
[14010.23s -> 14012.23s]  I'm losing my weekly cake to you punks.
[14012.23s -> 14015.36s]  Kenny's not in this scene.
[14015.36s -> 14032.00s]  Damn it, they went down there.
[14032.00s -> 14034.63s]  What the fuck?
[14039.43s -> 14046.08s]  $30 suit bullshit.
[14046.08s -> 14052.04s]  Down again.
[14052.04s -> 14054.98s]  House flipper. It really is
[14054.98s -> 14056.98s]  the house flipper bunker, isn't it?
[14056.98s -> 14059.28s]  Whoa!
[14059.28s -> 14065.68s]  Alright, the last guy I'm gonna punch.
[14065.68s -> 14068.69s]  I wanna subdue the last one.
[14068.69s -> 14075.09s]  Gotta reload, he's gotta reload!
[14075.09s -> 14077.27s]  How do I tackle him?
[14077.27s -> 14090.52s]  I tried to hit X, X is usually tackle.
[14090.52s -> 14095.00s]  We're getting bacon tonight!
[14095.00s -> 14097.62s]  It's time to eat
[14097.62s -> 14099.62s]  lots of bacon!
[14103.62s -> 14105.62s]  Code four.
[14107.62s -> 14109.62s]  Code four.
[14109.62s -> 14121.59s]  So the guy did die.
[14123.59s -> 14134.52s]  Do you guys eat
[14134.52s -> 14136.52s]  eggs in one bite?
[14136.52s -> 14138.52s]  Or do you cut them up and let all the fucking goo go everywhere?
[14138.52s -> 14141.46s]  You go to a breakfast place
[14141.46s -> 14143.46s]  and you order, oh, two sunny side up eggs
[14143.46s -> 14145.46s]  or two over easy, whatever.
[14147.46s -> 14152.26s]  You do it, you cut it up and
[14152.26s -> 14155.72s]  you just eat the whole thing.
[14157.72s -> 14159.72s]  Typically what I like to do, I like to
[14159.72s -> 14161.72s]  separate it. I don't really like to have the yolk
[14161.72s -> 14163.72s]  and all of the other stuff.
[14163.72s -> 14165.72s]  So I'll drop like two or three drops of Tabasco sauce.
[14165.72s -> 14167.72s]  A little bit of salt and pepper
[14167.72s -> 14169.72s]  and the whole thing.
[14169.72s -> 14171.72s]  Just one whole egg, just gone.
[14171.72s -> 14179.52s]  Enjoy it.
[14183.88s -> 14185.88s]  Same, same, one bite, yeah.
[14185.88s -> 14187.88s]  That's disgusting, what?
[14187.88s -> 14189.88s]  You think like 30%
[14189.88s -> 14191.88s]  of the audience here is disgusting.
[14191.88s -> 14195.46s]  What do you mean, what are these topics?
[14195.46s -> 14197.46s]  We're talking about bacon! We just had a huge conversation
[14197.46s -> 14199.46s]  about getting bacon.
[14199.46s -> 14201.46s]  So I'm pivoting the conversation
[14201.46s -> 14203.46s]  to talk about breakfast because bacon and breakfast
[14203.46s -> 14205.46s]  and eggs is what goes together.
[14205.46s -> 14207.46s]  Guys, we're driving around.
[14207.46s -> 14209.46s]  I gotta think of something to talk about.
[14209.46s -> 14211.46s]  It's gonna be bacon, eggs, and toast!
[14211.46s -> 14223.22s]  Weirdos.
[14223.22s -> 14225.22s]  I wasn't even close.
[14225.22s -> 14227.22s]  I wasn't even close. I wasn't. I just wasn't even close.
[14227.22s -> 14229.65s]  That lady ate shit
[14229.65s -> 14239.32s]  and I didn't do anything.
[14239.32s -> 14241.32s]  Ready your dad.
[14241.32s -> 14246.87s]  I'm sick of this.
[14246.87s -> 14250.96s]  Oh old lady,
[14250.96s -> 14252.96s]  hello officers, it's so
[14252.96s -> 14254.96s]  beautiful to see you. I did it.
[14254.96s -> 14259.75s]  She did it.
[14265.75s -> 14267.99s]  I'm Mrs. Barbara Lepente, the owner of this
[14267.99s -> 14269.99s]  boarding house. Is there a problem?
[14269.99s -> 14271.99s]  I'm afraid so, ma'am.
[14271.99s -> 14273.99s]  Do you mind if we come in? Is there somewhere we can discuss this?
[14273.99s -> 14275.99s]  Of course.
[14275.99s -> 14279.57s]  Follow me through to the parlor.
[14279.57s -> 14281.57s]  Wap your feet as you come in, detectives.
[14281.57s -> 14286.88s]  It's this way.
[14286.88s -> 14288.88s]  Sorry, I'm gonna walk dirt all over her house. Fuck this lady.
[14288.88s -> 14290.88s]  Mrs. Maldonado was found
[14290.88s -> 14292.88s]  dead this morning.
[14292.88s -> 14295.19s]  Dead? Oh no!
[14295.19s -> 14297.19s]  She can't be.
[14297.19s -> 14299.19s]  I'm afraid she was murdered, ma'am.
[14299.19s -> 14301.19s]  Let's take a look at her things.
[14301.19s -> 14303.19s]  I can't believe it.
[14303.19s -> 14305.19s]  A person seems so alive
[14305.19s -> 14309.08s]  and then they're gone.
[14309.08s -> 14311.08s]  Antonia's room is upstairs,
[14311.08s -> 14313.08s]  last door on the left.
[14313.08s -> 14315.08s]  Thank you. We'll be back shortly.
[14315.08s -> 14317.08s]  Excuse us
[14317.08s -> 14323.48s]  a moment, ma'am.
[14323.48s -> 14341.46s]  Room is upstairs.
[14341.46s -> 14344.32s]  You look at that?
[14344.32s -> 14346.32s]  Someone's turned the place over.
[14346.32s -> 14348.32s]  Another broken window.
[14348.32s -> 14350.32s]  A smashed window explains why the place looks tossed.
[14350.32s -> 14353.78s]  Iron picket broken window.
[14353.78s -> 14355.78s]  This person smashes windows.
[14357.78s -> 14360.60s]  Shoo.
[14360.60s -> 14362.60s]  That doesn't matter anymore, does it?
[14362.60s -> 14367.81s]  An auto.
[14367.81s -> 14372.74s]  Another envelope.
[14372.74s -> 14376.13s]  That was a lot of reading.
[14376.13s -> 14378.13s]  Further to my previous correspondence,
[14378.13s -> 14380.13s]  I'm writing to inform you that your petition to the Superior Court
[14380.13s -> 14382.13s]  of the State of California has been accepted
[14382.13s -> 14384.13s]  in a court date scheduled.
[14384.13s -> 14386.13s]  Your case, document number 985,
[14386.13s -> 14388.13s]  will be heard on September 17th.
[14388.13s -> 14390.13s]  Your husband, Angel Christopher Maldano,
[14390.13s -> 14392.13s]  residing at 30433
[14392.13s -> 14394.13s]  N Hills 3, Los Angeles,
[14394.13s -> 14396.13s]  California, has been served with the official
[14396.13s -> 14398.13s]  papers and is on notice to appear at the Central District Court
[14398.13s -> 14401.52s]  Okay.
[14401.52s -> 14403.52s]  Alright, buddy. Thank you.
[14403.52s -> 14405.52s]  On the date above, though it is not essential
[14405.52s -> 14407.52s]  and many women in your position choose not to do so,
[14407.52s -> 14409.96s]  I would advise you also
[14409.96s -> 14411.96s]  to appear at the Central District Court on the scheduled date.
[14411.96s -> 14413.96s]  In my experience,
[14413.96s -> 14415.96s]  a woman plaintiff's presence in cases like this
[14415.96s -> 14417.96s]  one can do much to influence proceedings.
[14417.96s -> 14419.96s]  And if your husband does not appear on September 17th,
[14419.96s -> 14421.96s]  which you have told me is likely,
[14421.96s -> 14423.96s]  then it can only help your
[14423.96s -> 14425.96s]  our chances.
[14425.96s -> 14427.96s]  You are sincerely
[14427.96s -> 14432.24s]  my signature.
[14432.24s -> 14434.24s]  We gotta see granny's feet
[14434.24s -> 14446.15s]  before we reach a conclusion.
[14446.15s -> 14448.15s]  Charm bracelet wasn't among the crime scene
[14448.15s -> 14451.03s]  evidence.
[14451.03s -> 14461.40s]  So it means it was taken.
[14461.40s -> 14463.96s]  We still can't read cursive?
[14463.96s -> 14476.23s]  Can you?
[14476.23s -> 14478.23s]  Alright, now what?
[14478.23s -> 14480.23s]  Oh, I guess this is like a, nevermind, okay.
[14480.23s -> 14484.00s]  Well, we have some questions, ma'am.
[14484.00s -> 14486.00s]  If you're up to it.
[14486.00s -> 14488.44s]  Yes, detective. I'll do my best.
[14488.44s -> 14490.61s]  Why are you so
[14490.61s -> 14492.61s]  stupid to not hear somebody breaking into your
[14492.61s -> 14494.61s]  room upstairs? What are you, out of your
[14494.61s -> 14498.71s]  mind?
[14498.71s -> 14500.71s]  Do you have any idea who might have wanted to hurt
[14500.71s -> 14502.71s]  Mrs. Maldonado?
[14502.71s -> 14504.71s]  That ride of her husband, Angel.
[14504.71s -> 14507.08s]  She was serving him divorce papers.
[14507.08s -> 14509.08s]  If I killed every wife that served me
[14509.08s -> 14511.08s]  papers, I'd be a mass murderer.
[14511.08s -> 14513.08s]  Are you being flippant, young man?
[14513.08s -> 14518.26s]  No, ma'am.
[14518.26s -> 14520.26s]  I mean, she's got stone
[14520.26s -> 14522.26s]  cold lock-on gaze here. I don't
[14522.26s -> 14524.26s]  believe her. What can you tell us about
[14524.26s -> 14526.76s]  Angel Maldonado?
[14526.76s -> 14528.76s]  She married him when she was 17.
[14528.76s -> 14531.25s]  He was cruel to her.
[14531.25s -> 14534.32s]  Very cruel. She was a good
[14534.32s -> 14536.32s]  girl. Little on the religious
[14536.32s -> 14538.32s]  side, but a good girl.
[14538.32s -> 14541.27s]  Stone cold Steve Austin.
[14541.27s -> 14543.64s]  Movements of victim.
[14543.64s -> 14554.32s]  What time did Antonia
[14554.32s -> 14556.32s]  go out yesterday?
[14556.32s -> 14558.32s]  She left around 9.
[14558.32s -> 14561.40s]  Do you know where she went? No.
[14561.40s -> 14564.08s]  I have no idea. She was a good
[14564.08s -> 14568.56s]  girl, but she didn't invite me.
[14568.56s -> 14570.56s]  Oh, your stone cold gaze
[14570.56s -> 14572.56s]  has suddenly turned into
[14572.56s -> 14574.56s]  point eyes down.
[14574.56s -> 14576.80s]  A nosy old hag
[14576.80s -> 14578.80s]  like you knows everything about the people who live
[14578.80s -> 14580.80s]  under her roof. Where did she go?
[14580.80s -> 14582.80s]  I think she went to a bar.
[14582.80s -> 14586.20s]  She's been drinking quite a lot lately.
[14586.20s -> 14588.20s]  This bar have a name?
[14588.20s -> 14590.69s]  El Dorado Bar. Got it.
[14590.69s -> 14592.69s]  Latino place on North Los Angeles
[14592.69s -> 14594.69s]  Street. That's only a couple of blocks
[14594.69s -> 14596.69s]  from where we found the body.
[14596.69s -> 14599.25s]  Evidence of break-in.
[14599.25s -> 14601.25s]  You've had a break-in?
[14601.25s -> 14604.00s]  No!
[14604.00s -> 14606.24s]  No!
[14606.24s -> 14608.24s]  No!
[14608.24s -> 14610.74s]  Wait, did she just not know?
[14610.74s -> 14617.01s]  Antonia's rear
[14617.01s -> 14619.01s]  window smashed glass and damaged a frame.
[14619.01s -> 14626.95s]  Maybe she really is just like an
[14626.95s -> 14634.95s]  old lady and can't hear it.
[14634.95s -> 14636.95s]  This is her.
[14636.95s -> 14638.95s]  What do you have to hide?
[14638.95s -> 14640.95s]  I have no idea what you are talking about.
[14640.95s -> 14647.54s]  So Antonia lost her keys
[14647.54s -> 14649.54s]  and used an iron bar to jimmy the back window?
[14649.54s -> 14653.00s]  I heard a noise in the
[14653.00s -> 14655.00s]  early hours of the morning.
[14655.00s -> 14657.00s]  I thought it might be a raccoon at the milk bottles.
[14657.00s -> 14661.41s]  It'd be very bad
[14661.41s -> 14663.41s]  for business if this news got out.
[14663.41s -> 14665.41s]  For reputation to protect.
[14665.41s -> 14671.36s]  Antonia and her husband
[14671.36s -> 14673.36s]  were estranged?
[14673.36s -> 14675.86s]  Yes. She moved
[14675.86s -> 14677.86s]  here after she separated from her
[14677.86s -> 14679.86s]  husband two months ago.
[14679.86s -> 14681.86s]  But Antonia still wore a wedding ring?
[14681.86s -> 14683.86s]  She wore the wedding ring
[14683.86s -> 14685.86s]  and a necklace.
[14685.86s -> 14687.86s]  She always wore a religious
[14687.86s -> 14690.87s]  necklace. That's about all
[14690.87s -> 14695.54s]  of her jewelry.
[14695.54s -> 14705.44s]  That's not a necklace.
[14705.44s -> 14707.44s]  Lady. What about her bracelet?
[14707.44s -> 14709.44s]  I don't know anything about a bracelet.
[14709.44s -> 14714.05s]  Oh, you don't?
[14714.05s -> 14716.93s]  In her wedding photo, she's displaying
[14716.93s -> 14720.77s]  a charm bracelet.
[14720.77s -> 14722.77s]  She never wore it.
[14722.77s -> 14724.77s]  He gave it to her.
[14724.77s -> 14726.77s]  Show his captain that wooden jewelry box.
[14726.77s -> 14729.52s]  Thanks, ma'am.
[14729.52s -> 14731.52s]  Four out of four.
[14731.52s -> 14733.52s]  I got it.
[14733.52s -> 14737.43s]  Lock him up and throw away the key.
[14737.43s -> 14739.43s]  We can either front angel
[14739.43s -> 14741.43s]  seeing as the finger's pointing right at him
[14741.43s -> 14745.40s]  or we can check out the old Aranda one.
[14745.40s -> 14751.33s]  What do you want to do, partner?
[14751.33s -> 14753.33s]  You find him and you throw him away.
[14753.33s -> 14757.17s]  Arrest the grandma
[14757.17s -> 14765.04s]  for lying.
[14765.04s -> 14767.04s]  Residents are the bar.
[14767.04s -> 14769.54s]  We're just going
[14769.54s -> 14771.54s]  in a straight line.
[14771.54s -> 14773.54s]  A nosy old hag?
[14773.54s -> 14775.72s]  And I thought I was coming
[14775.72s -> 14777.72s]  on strong with the ex-wife's line.
[14777.72s -> 14779.72s]  Sometimes you have to be firm to get the information you need.
[14779.72s -> 14781.72s]  Eat the key.
[14783.72s -> 14786.98s]  How about we drop in on the husband instead?
[14786.98s -> 14788.98s]  See if your gut is right.
[14788.98s -> 14790.98s]  I'll take a bar over a husband
[14790.98s -> 14792.98s]  every day of the week.
[14792.98s -> 14795.54s]  Well, that wasn't in the first
[14795.54s -> 14797.54s]  line.
[14799.54s -> 14807.48s]  Cole, come on!
[14807.48s -> 14811.32s]  That isn't a road.
[14811.32s -> 14813.62s]  Goddess here quicker, didn't it?
[14817.78s -> 14819.78s]  Goddess here quicker now, didn't it?
[14819.78s -> 14827.97s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14827.97s -> 14833.60s]  It's all in cursive.
[14833.60s -> 14835.60s]  His wasn't in cursive.
[14835.60s -> 14845.08s]  I could read it.
[14845.08s -> 14848.66s]  Three, oh, four.
[14848.66s -> 14851.16s]  One, two, three.
[14851.16s -> 14853.16s]  He does the same thing I do.
[14853.16s -> 14856.68s]  Since I was probably like
[14856.68s -> 14858.68s]  twelve, I've never walked up
[14858.68s -> 14860.68s]  the steps one step at a time.
[14860.68s -> 14862.85s]  I always do one, two,
[14862.85s -> 14866.05s]  two steps at a time. Check it.
[14866.05s -> 14870.64s]  Yep. Wait.
[14870.64s -> 14875.19s]  I don't do that.
[14875.19s -> 14877.62s]  That's three, no, that's two.
[14877.62s -> 14884.15s]  I can just feel myself doing it.
[14892.74s -> 14894.74s]  Watch out!
[14894.74s -> 14896.92s]  Watch out!
[14896.92s -> 14901.12s]  Here comes a fight.
[14901.12s -> 14913.16s]  I remember how to fight now.
[14917.64s -> 14920.45s]  What did he say?
[14955.09s -> 14957.33s]  Sit back down.
[14962.00s -> 14964.76s]  Can you please stop getting up?
[14964.76s -> 14966.76s]  Sit down.
[14966.76s -> 14969.19s]  Okay.
[14969.19s -> 14971.19s]  Canvas the Neighbors.
[14971.19s -> 14977.14s]  Let's take a look.
[14977.14s -> 14979.14s]  I didn't.
[14979.14s -> 14984.39s]  Well, see, the problem here, buddy,
[14984.39s -> 14988.61s]  is I didn't get hit once
[14988.61s -> 14992.00s]  and you didn't.
[14992.00s -> 14994.00s]  I didn't.
[14994.00s -> 14996.00s]  I didn't.
[14996.00s -> 14998.00s]  I didn't get hit once and you did.
[14998.00s -> 15000.00s]  You weren't paying attention to my
[15000.00s -> 15002.00s]  flawless victory while you were getting
[15002.00s -> 15004.00s]  stomped on.
[15004.00s -> 15008.68s]  Pay more attention next time.
[15008.68s -> 15010.68s]  Just picked fruit market.
[15010.68s -> 15014.77s]  I wonder if Angel gets all his
[15014.77s -> 15017.33s]  groceries from this place.
[15017.33s -> 15020.21s]  Epic Victory Royale.
[15020.21s -> 15029.68s]  Blood on the shirt.
[15029.68s -> 15031.68s]  In two places. Check this one.
[15031.68s -> 15033.68s]  This will take some explaining.
[15033.68s -> 15051.84s]  Maybe one of the neighbors
[15051.84s -> 15053.84s]  took notice of Angel's movements.
[15053.84s -> 15055.84s]  Got no alibi.
[15055.84s -> 15062.55s]  Neighbor.
[15062.55s -> 15067.92s]  So this is a neighbor.
[15067.92s -> 15069.92s]  Is this the neighbor?
[15069.92s -> 15071.92s]  It's the neighbor.
[15071.92s -> 15073.92s]  We're making some inquiries.
[15073.92s -> 15075.92s]  So you weren't home last night?
[15075.92s -> 15077.92s]  No, I was at work.
[15077.92s -> 15079.92s]  You know nothing about Mrs. Maldonado
[15079.92s -> 15081.92s]  fighting with her husband?
[15081.92s -> 15083.92s]  They're always screaming the place down.
[15083.92s -> 15091.20s]  Thanks.
[15091.20s -> 15097.73s]  Why does it sound like you're talking
[15097.73s -> 15100.10s]  from the bathroom?
[15100.10s -> 15116.28s]  We can't go this way.
[15116.28s -> 15133.62s]  Oh yeah, we can. Come on. Get out of the way.
[15133.62s -> 15135.62s]  Wait, I missed a neighbor?
[15135.62s -> 15143.24s]  I missed a neighbor?
[15143.24s -> 15150.34s]  What are the neighbors? Like down the hall?
[15150.34s -> 15155.00s]  Oh.
[15155.00s -> 15157.00s]  There's 20 people in this building but
[15157.00s -> 15159.00s]  they don't know each other?
[15159.00s -> 15166.23s]  Whoa!
[15166.23s -> 15168.23s]  Sorry about that. I'm playing with my kids.
[15168.23s -> 15170.53s]  LAPD.
[15170.53s -> 15172.53s]  Were you here last night?
[15172.53s -> 15174.53s]  My wife and I
[15174.53s -> 15176.53s]  are separated.
[15176.53s -> 15178.53s]  And I had the kids last night.
[15178.53s -> 15180.53s]  Why are you wearing this fucking mask?
[15180.53s -> 15182.53s]  Thanks.
[15182.53s -> 15184.77s]  Okay.
[15184.77s -> 15191.17s]  Well, there's that.
[15191.17s -> 15193.17s]  He's playing rollercoaster tycoon.
[15193.17s -> 15195.17s]  LAPD. Did you hear a disturbance last night?
[15195.17s -> 15197.17s]  Yes. Yes I did.
[15197.17s -> 15199.17s]  Mrs. Maldonado
[15199.17s -> 15201.17s]  lit out of here and her husband ran out after.
[15201.17s -> 15203.17s]  You saw this, Miss?
[15203.17s -> 15205.73s]  A randa.
[15205.73s -> 15207.73s]  I had the door open a crack.
[15207.73s -> 15209.73s]  Did you see Mr. Maldonado come back inside after he ran out?
[15209.73s -> 15212.10s]  No.
[15212.10s -> 15214.10s]  I didn't.
[15214.10s -> 15217.36s]  Thanks. We'll be in touch.
[15217.36s -> 15219.36s]  I kept thinking you weren't going to call that one a nosy old hag too, Phelps.
[15219.36s -> 15221.36s]  Do you know how much I've sacrificed?
[15221.36s -> 15224.18s]  I'm executing
[15224.18s -> 15226.18s]  restraint right now,
[15226.18s -> 15228.74s]  Finbar.
[15228.74s -> 15247.36s]  Just picked fruit.
[15247.36s -> 15260.42s]  Uh...
[15260.42s -> 15262.42s]  And Francis Langford.
[15262.42s -> 15266.32s]  Yes, for lovely, lustrous hair.
[15266.32s -> 15268.32s]  For all types of hair,
[15268.32s -> 15270.32s]  use green shampoo.
[15270.32s -> 15272.32s]  D-R-E-N-E.
[15272.32s -> 15274.32s]  Green shampoo in the familiar
[15274.32s -> 15276.32s]  blue and yellow package.
[15276.32s -> 15278.82s]  Alright, if I get in a car accident...
[15278.82s -> 15280.82s]  Watch where you're driving, you maniac!
[15280.82s -> 15282.82s]  If I don't get in any car accidents, and even a fender bender,
[15282.82s -> 15284.82s]  then I get to have all the bacon I want tonight.
[15284.82s -> 15311.75s]  Nice.
[15311.75s -> 15314.63s]  Don't ruin your cholesterol.
[15314.63s -> 15316.63s]  I won't. I won't. I won't. I won't.
[15316.63s -> 15318.63s]  What can I get you?
[15318.63s -> 15320.63s]  LAPD. Detectives Phelps and Galloway.
[15320.63s -> 15322.63s]  Diego Aguilar.
[15322.63s -> 15324.63s]  How can I help?
[15324.63s -> 15326.63s]  You were at a bar last night?
[15326.63s -> 15328.63s]  Yeah, being a temp guy from the agency.
[15328.63s -> 15330.63s]  Did you have a woman in here last night?
[15330.63s -> 15332.63s]  21 years old, Hispanic, drinking heavily?
[15332.63s -> 15334.63s]  We have a lot of ladies like that in here.
[15334.63s -> 15336.63s]  But yeah, I know who you mean.
[15336.63s -> 15338.63s]  Antonio Maldonado.
[15338.63s -> 15340.63s]  What did she do?
[15340.63s -> 15343.19s]  She was murdered last night.
[15343.19s -> 15345.19s]  Oh, shit.
[15345.19s -> 15347.19s]  Do you know her well?
[15347.19s -> 15349.19s]  Was she a regular?
[15349.19s -> 15351.19s]  Hell no.
[15351.19s -> 15353.19s]  She was good and tight last night, complaining about her old man.
[15353.19s -> 15355.19s]  Working in a bar.
[15355.19s -> 15357.19s]  She was so hammered last night, she left a letter on the bar.
[15357.19s -> 15359.19s]  More letters.
[15359.19s -> 15365.46s]  I'll show you.
[15365.46s -> 15367.46s]  A waitress. Can I have another spoon?
[15367.46s -> 15369.76s]  Okay.
[15369.76s -> 15372.90s]  Is this one also empty?
[15372.90s -> 15380.13s]  The horse papers.
[15380.13s -> 15383.27s]  Did you open them?
[15383.27s -> 15385.27s]  No need to. She was shouting about it
[15385.27s -> 15387.27s]  and waving the letter around.
[15387.27s -> 15390.15s]  Said she was going to show him.
[15390.15s -> 15392.15s]  Whereas Antonio Maldonado
[15392.15s -> 15394.15s]  did on the 8th day of August,
[15394.15s -> 15396.15s]  1947,
[15396.15s -> 15398.15s]  prefer her petition that she
[15398.15s -> 15400.15s]  might be divorced from the bonds of matrimony
[15400.15s -> 15402.15s]  entered into with you,
[15402.15s -> 15404.15s]  Angel Maldonado.
[15404.15s -> 15406.15s]  Would you therefore command that Angel Maldonado
[15406.15s -> 15408.15s]  that said defend? This is boring.
[15408.15s -> 15411.48s]  You did a bad job with this one.
[15411.48s -> 15422.16s]  What an uncreative mad lid, man.
[15422.16s -> 15424.60s]  Alright.
[15424.60s -> 15426.60s]  Hold on.
[15426.60s -> 15430.37s]  Did you bleed on the trail?
[15430.37s -> 15440.55s]  Can you remember
[15440.55s -> 15442.55s]  what jewelry she was wearing?
[15442.55s -> 15444.55s]  She had a necklace.
[15444.55s -> 15446.98s]  Some kind of religious thing, I think.
[15446.98s -> 15448.98s]  The temp guy would have more of an idea.
[15448.98s -> 15450.98s]  She took the beer he served her and cried
[15450.98s -> 15452.98s]  into it all night.
[15452.98s -> 15454.98s]  What time did she leave?
[15454.98s -> 15462.92s]  Can't say for sure.
[15462.92s -> 15464.92s]  Where did she go?
[15464.92s -> 15466.92s]  Give me something or the LAPD will start getting
[15466.92s -> 15468.92s]  interested in this place.
[15468.92s -> 15470.92s]  Closing squinting his eyes.
[15470.92s -> 15473.22s]  My phone was out of order.
[15473.22s -> 15475.22s]  The closest one I knew was at the fruit market
[15475.22s -> 15477.22s]  across the street, so I suggested she try that.
[15477.22s -> 15479.22s]  Fruit market.
[15479.22s -> 15481.22s]  We have a place, fruit market.
[15481.22s -> 15483.22s]  Did Antonia say
[15483.22s -> 15485.22s]  where she was going when she left?
[15485.22s -> 15487.22s]  She said she was going to serve the papers on the husband.
[15487.22s -> 15489.22s]  Said that would take the smile off
[15489.22s -> 15491.72s]  his face.
[15491.72s -> 15493.72s]  If you ask me, she was scared.
[15493.72s -> 15495.72s]  And the drink was
[15495.72s -> 15505.00s]  for Dutch courage.
[15505.00s -> 15507.00s]  Did she attract any interest?
[15507.00s -> 15509.00s]  An extremely drunk young woman? What do you think?
[15509.00s -> 15511.94s]  She managed to scare them off, though.
[15511.94s -> 15513.94s]  Thanks.
[15513.94s -> 15515.94s]  You've been a big help. Perfect!
[15515.94s -> 15518.63s]  Perfect!
[15518.63s -> 15521.32s]  Hey, get the guy, will you?
[15521.32s -> 15523.99s]  We'll do our best.
[15523.99s -> 15525.99s]  One last question. What size shoe do you take,
[15525.99s -> 15528.48s]  Mr. Aguilar?
[15528.48s -> 15530.48s]  A broad nine. I have wide feet.
[15530.48s -> 15542.52s]  He thinks he's a bit of a gang.
[15542.52s -> 15547.49s]  Okay. Show
[15547.49s -> 15555.88s]  feet.
[15555.88s -> 15557.88s]  Get out of the way. Why would you? Get out of the way!
[15557.88s -> 15560.31s]  Can you?
[15560.31s -> 15562.31s]  Why would you get
[15562.31s -> 15564.48s]  in this way?
[15564.48s -> 15567.88s]  I feel like they're out of a bar still here.
[15567.88s -> 15569.88s]  What? Isn't this where I am?
[15569.88s -> 15584.77s]  Didn't I just do this?
[15584.77s -> 15594.56s]  Uh...
[15600.47s -> 15603.67s]  Out of order.
[15605.84s -> 15608.79s]  Talk to temp guy.
[15620.79s -> 15622.79s]  Give me those feet.
[15628.79s -> 15630.96s]  Where are his feet, Ben?
[15630.96s -> 15632.96s]  Let me see.
[15632.96s -> 15634.96s]  Wait, wait, wait!
[15634.96s -> 15637.40s]  I didn't get your number!
[15637.40s -> 15643.03s]  I saw a telephone.
[15643.03s -> 15648.08s]  Is there anything else to do here?
[15648.08s -> 15654.23s]  Can this be over?
[15654.23s -> 15659.92s]  Do I use the phone?
[15659.92s -> 15668.74s]  Call it in.
[15668.74s -> 15682.37s]  What is happening?
[15682.37s -> 15686.60s]  Detective?
[15686.60s -> 15688.60s]  Where does Hatt go?
[15688.60s -> 15699.27s]  Thanks, ma'am.
[15699.27s -> 15701.27s]  I think his name is Phelps.
[15701.27s -> 15705.30s]  I read about him in the paper.
[15705.30s -> 15714.84s]  You're talking about me?
[15714.84s -> 15717.46s]  Those aren't in this game.
[15717.46s -> 15721.36s]  Sorry, man.
[15721.36s -> 15724.63s]  No, the other Phelps.
[15724.63s -> 15728.02s]  Apparently I'm famous around here from solving
[15728.02s -> 15732.69s]  all these mysteries.
[15732.69s -> 15734.69s]  I'm not actually waiting for him to get in the car
[15734.69s -> 15739.68s]  and then move out of the way, am I?
[15739.68s -> 15741.68s]  You don't think it's strange that all these murders
[15741.68s -> 15743.68s]  are happening to girls who've been out drinking?
[15743.68s -> 15745.68s]  No, no. A broad drinks,
[15745.68s -> 15747.68s]  she gets a bit tired, and she starts mouthing off.
[15747.68s -> 15749.68s]  Is there something I missed in here?
[15749.68s -> 15751.68s]  And she ends up in an alleyway.
[15751.68s -> 15753.68s]  A sad story that this town
[15753.68s -> 15755.68s]  has seen it play out a thousand times, Cole.
[15755.68s -> 15757.68s]  Why don't you want to see a connection here?
[15757.68s -> 15759.68s]  Because there are perfectly good
[15759.68s -> 15761.68s]  real-life suspects
[15761.68s -> 15763.68s]  for every one of these murders.
[15763.68s -> 15765.68s]  We don't need to go looking for the monster
[15765.68s -> 15767.68s]  under the bed.
[15767.68s -> 15769.68s]  Move, I need to turn the other way.
[15769.68s -> 15771.68s]  Another letter? I thought the letter was from a nut.
[15773.68s -> 15775.68s]  These letters?
[15775.68s -> 15777.68s]  There goes the bacon.
[15777.68s -> 15779.99s]  Now we sent another.
[15779.99s -> 15782.36s]  I really hate this fuck.
[15782.36s -> 15794.32s]  Shut. Great.
[15794.32s -> 15796.88s]  We'll need to come back later, Phelps.
[15796.88s -> 15798.88s]  Maybe somebody here saw Antonia
[15798.88s -> 15804.71s]  the night she died.
[15804.71s -> 15809.25s]  I have to come back at night?
[15809.25s -> 15811.68s]  Why don't you get in?
[15811.68s -> 15822.93s]  Okay.
[15822.93s -> 15824.93s]  Back to the police station, then.
[15824.93s -> 15837.99s]  Oh, that's cinematic camera. Okay.
[15837.99s -> 15840.29s]  Alright, if I get in one car accident
[15840.29s -> 15842.29s]  in cinematic camera, then I get all the bacon that I want.
[15874.16s -> 15876.16s]  Did I just...
[15876.16s -> 15878.16s]  Did I just yell...
[15878.16s -> 15884.05s]  He yelled that out the window.
[15887.51s -> 15889.51s]  Why wouldn't you stop me?
[15889.51s -> 15895.46s]  Why wouldn't you stop the car?
[15895.46s -> 15897.46s]  The captain is waiting for you downstairs with anchor.
[15897.46s -> 15904.37s]  The captain's waiting for you downstairs.
[15904.37s -> 15908.92s]  We gonna go downstairs
[15908.92s -> 15910.92s]  and see Donnelly or what?
[15910.92s -> 15912.92s]  There's downstairs room.
[15912.92s -> 15914.92s]  You have to spell it out for me. I don't know.
[15914.92s -> 15918.44s]  I'm receiving hospital this way.
[15918.44s -> 15920.68s]  It doesn't say downstairs room.
[15920.68s -> 15922.68s]  How to get downstairs.
[15922.68s -> 15924.68s]  Isn't that the cop that caught the guy that was pretending to be Donnelly?
[15924.68s -> 15939.33s]  Downstairs. Ooh, now I know where I am.
[15939.33s -> 15941.57s]  What's up? Hey, what's up?
[15941.57s -> 15944.20s]  Phelps, have you met Finnis Brown?
[15944.20s -> 15946.20s]  Pleased to meet you, sir.
[15946.20s -> 15948.20s]  This information is confidential and doesn't leave this room.
[15948.20s -> 15950.20s]  The new letter was left in the back seat of a cab.
[15950.20s -> 15952.20s]  Ow, my elbow.
[15952.20s -> 15954.20s]  The driver thinks it was put through the window and not left by a customer.
[15954.20s -> 15956.37s]  We're checking all the spares back 24 hours, regardless.
[15956.37s -> 15958.37s]  Good.
[15958.37s -> 15960.68s]  Like the previous letters, it's been assembled from headlines
[15960.68s -> 15962.68s]  and typed from the Times and Examiner,
[15962.68s -> 15964.68s]  then glued to an envelope.
[15964.68s -> 15966.68s]  What is the other note?
[15966.68s -> 15968.68s]  This one? That's also new.
[15968.68s -> 15970.68s]  A poem, hand-typed.
[15970.68s -> 15972.68s]  Do you mind if I take a look?
[15972.68s -> 15974.68s]  Go ahead.
[15974.68s -> 15976.68s]  You've been over both documents pretty carefully.
[15976.68s -> 15978.68s]  They've been wiped with gasoline,
[15978.68s -> 15980.68s]  so there's no chance of prints.
[15980.68s -> 15984.13s]  That works.
[15984.13s -> 15987.33s]  Have changed my mind.
[15987.33s -> 15989.33s]  You would not give a square deal.
[15989.33s -> 15991.33s]  Fuck you.
[15991.33s -> 16003.41s]  Buddy.
[16003.41s -> 16005.41s]  Heap upon thy soul by virtue of this curse.
[16005.41s -> 16007.41s]  He'll read it.
[16007.41s -> 16010.61s]  Ill deeds,
[16010.61s -> 16012.61s]  then be thou damned, beholding good,
[16012.61s -> 16014.61s]  both infinite as is the universe,
[16014.61s -> 16016.61s]  and thou and thy self-torturing solitude,
[16016.61s -> 16018.61s]  an awful image of calm power.
[16018.61s -> 16020.61s]  The now thou sittest,
[16020.61s -> 16022.61s]  let thy hour
[16022.61s -> 16024.61s]  come, when thou must appear to be
[16024.61s -> 16026.61s]  that which thou art eternally.
[16026.61s -> 16028.61s]  And after many a fake
[16028.61s -> 16030.61s]  and false fruitless fruit station
[16030.61s -> 16032.61s]  fruit market crimes, scorn track thy
[16032.61s -> 16034.61s]  lagging fall through boundless space and time.
[16036.61s -> 16039.11s]  That's why we called you in.
[16039.11s -> 16042.44s]  Do you think it's original?
[16042.44s -> 16044.44s]  Not unless he's a genius.
[16044.44s -> 16046.44s]  You like this Nat Jobs poem?
[16046.44s -> 16048.44s]  No, I like Shelley.
[16048.44s -> 16050.44s]  It was written at least one hundred years ago.
[16050.44s -> 16052.44s]  Shelley? One hundred?
[16052.44s -> 16054.93s]  Sure, I knew that.
[16054.93s -> 16056.93s]  You see, Finnis, I told you this lad was a bright boy.
[16056.93s -> 16058.93s]  Sure, but what has it got to do with the case?
[16060.93s -> 16062.93s]  Prometheus Unbound.
[16062.93s -> 16064.93s]  Prometheus was a titan,
[16064.93s -> 16066.93s]  a superhuman character who defied the gods
[16066.93s -> 16068.93s]  to bring fire to humanity.
[16068.93s -> 16071.17s]  The Dahlia Guy
[16071.17s -> 16073.17s]  believes he's Superman.
[16073.17s -> 16075.17s]  Your guess is as good as mine.
[16075.17s -> 16077.17s]  One thing presumes that he's educated.
[16077.17s -> 16079.17s]  What about the link to the Henry case?
[16079.17s -> 16081.17s]  He could have got the wording from the papers.
[16081.17s -> 16083.17s]  As you said, he's fiendishly clever and takes pleasure in taunting us.
[16083.17s -> 16085.17s]  What's happening with the Maldonado case?
[16085.17s -> 16087.17s]  We have the husband in custody.
[16087.17s -> 16089.17s]  We haven't interviewed him yet.
[16089.17s -> 16091.17s]  Well, upstairs then lads
[16091.17s -> 16093.17s]  and see if we can break him.
[16093.17s -> 16096.24s]  Interview Maldonado?
[16096.24s -> 16098.87s]  That was a boomer reference?
[16098.87s -> 16105.08s]  How is that a boomer reference?
[16105.08s -> 16109.30s]  My father watched like
[16109.30s -> 16111.30s]  fucking Zorro.
[16111.30s -> 16113.48s]  What are you talking about?
[16115.48s -> 16120.98s]  Improved your attitude, Angel?
[16120.98s -> 16122.98s]  What do you want me to say?
[16122.98s -> 16125.54s]  I was with Antonia the night she died
[16125.54s -> 16127.54s]  but she left the apartment
[16127.54s -> 16131.25s]  and that was the last time I saw her.
[16158.31s -> 16160.31s]  Wow!
[16160.31s -> 16162.61s]  Religious necklace
[16162.61s -> 16164.61s]  Necklace worn habitually by the murder victim
[16164.61s -> 16167.88s]  Okay, bloodied shirt
[16167.88s -> 16169.88s]  A men's button down shirt stained with blood
[16169.88s -> 16171.88s]  and neighbor, Mrs. Arnada
[16171.88s -> 16173.88s]  testifies to Angel pursuing her from
[16173.88s -> 16175.88s]  apartment buildings.
[16175.88s -> 16181.70s]  Let's go.
[16181.70s -> 16183.88s]  I can't select this.
[16183.88s -> 16185.88s]  So your wife paid you a visit last night?
[16185.88s -> 16188.18s]  What time was that?
[16188.18s -> 16190.18s]  Late, around midnight maybe?
[16190.18s -> 16192.18s]  She didn't stay long.
[16192.18s -> 16198.39s]  I mean that's not...
[16198.39s -> 16200.39s]  I mean he chased her but
[16200.39s -> 16202.39s]  is that technically wrong?
[16202.39s -> 16207.17s]  Because
[16207.17s -> 16209.17s]  she didn't stay long doesn't necessarily mean
[16209.17s -> 16211.80s]  anything. He could have chased her at
[16211.80s -> 16213.80s]  ten o'clock or chased her at two in the morning.
[16213.80s -> 16219.04s]  I mean it's definitely a lie but
[16219.04s -> 16225.83s]  that's the community.
[16225.83s -> 16236.05s]  Okay, so
[16236.05s -> 16238.05s]  You're lying, Angel. You went after her.
[16238.05s -> 16240.05s]  I think you killed her.
[16240.05s -> 16242.61s]  You're out of your mind. My brother will tell you
[16242.61s -> 16245.04s]  I was at home.
[16245.04s -> 16249.14s]  I was at home.
[16249.14s -> 16251.89s]  I was at home.
[16251.89s -> 16253.89s]  I was at home.
[16253.89s -> 16255.89s]  I was at home.
[16255.89s -> 16257.89s]  I was at home.
[16257.89s -> 16259.89s]  I was at home.
[16259.89s -> 16261.89s]  I was at home.
[16261.89s -> 16263.89s]  I was at home.
[16263.89s -> 16265.89s]  I was at home.
[16265.89s -> 16268.26s]  I was at home.
[16268.26s -> 16270.26s]  I was at home.
[16270.26s -> 16272.26s]  I was at home.
[16272.26s -> 16275.33s]  I was at home.
[16275.33s -> 16278.40s]  I was at home.
[16278.40s -> 16281.67s]  Divorce? Okay, I have the divorce paper
[16281.67s -> 16283.67s]  so he can't really lie about this, can he?
[16283.67s -> 16285.67s]  You and your wife weren't getting along. She was divorcing you.
[16285.67s -> 16287.67s]  Is that why you killed her?
[16287.67s -> 16289.67s]  We fought, yeah, but
[16289.67s -> 16291.67s]  we weren't getting a divorce.
[16291.67s -> 16293.67s]  I mean that was his plan.
[16293.67s -> 16295.67s]  I don't believe you, Angel.
[16295.67s -> 16297.67s]  That was thrown in my face five times.
[16297.67s -> 16299.67s]  She pushed you too far and you lashed out.
[16299.67s -> 16301.67s]  I told you.
[16301.67s -> 16303.67s]  I asked the community once and they were wrong.
[16303.67s -> 16307.25s]  Where is it?
[16307.25s -> 16309.25s]  Divorce paper. This is for him, right?
[16309.25s -> 16311.81s]  Yes, okay.
[16311.81s -> 16313.81s]  The judge had set a date. You were going to be
[16313.81s -> 16315.81s]  paraded in front of the whole city for your cruelty
[16315.81s -> 16318.37s]  to her, Angel.
[16318.37s -> 16321.25s]  Antonia, oh Jesus.
[16321.25s -> 16324.64s]  She gave in drunk out of her mind.
[16324.64s -> 16326.82s]  She doesn't normally drink.
[16326.82s -> 16329.83s]  She was looking around in her bag.
[16329.83s -> 16331.83s]  What was that?
[16331.83s -> 16333.83s]  Said she wanted to serve me papers.
[16333.83s -> 16336.32s]  Me, her own husband.
[16336.32s -> 16338.32s]  I slapped her down and she ran out.
[16338.32s -> 16341.89s]  That's the truth.
[16341.89s -> 16343.89s]  What size shoe do you wear, Angel?
[16343.89s -> 16345.89s]  Excuse me.
[16345.89s -> 16348.07s]  What difference does that make?
[16348.07s -> 16352.08s]  When we found your wife,
[16352.08s -> 16354.08s]  her jewelry had been removed.
[16354.08s -> 16356.08s]  Was she wearing her religious
[16356.08s -> 16358.08s]  medallion last night?
[16358.08s -> 16362.87s]  Sure, she always wore that.
[16386.07s -> 16389.01s]  What about the charm bracelet?
[16389.01s -> 16391.01s]  Was she wearing that?
[16392.01s -> 16394.96s]  She never wore it.
[16394.96s -> 16401.34s]  She kept it locked up.
[16406.92s -> 16408.92s]  Your wife has been brutally murdered.
[16408.92s -> 16410.92s]  So how do you explain
[16410.92s -> 16412.92s]  your shirt being covered in blood?
[16412.92s -> 16416.44s]  You found that?
[16416.44s -> 16418.44s]  I cut myself shaving.
[16418.44s -> 16422.86s]  Really, did you?
[16422.86s -> 16428.36s]  Wait, maybe he did.
[16428.36s -> 16430.36s]  That's such a bad excuse, though.
[16430.36s -> 16432.36s]  If you cut yourself shaving, you don't have
[16432.36s -> 16434.36s]  a pint of blood all over you.
[16434.36s -> 16436.36s]  Angel, I'm not going to waste any more time on this.
[16436.36s -> 16438.36s]  Give me something or I'm going to have you charged.
[16438.36s -> 16440.36s]  My brother.
[16440.36s -> 16442.36s]  You cut your mouth and your eyebrow?
[16442.36s -> 16444.36s]  He said some bad things about Antonia last night.
[16444.36s -> 16446.36s]  I cut myself shaving. My eyebrows.
[16446.36s -> 16449.37s]  We got it.
[16449.37s -> 16451.37s]  Keep talking.
[16451.37s -> 16453.37s]  She said she came from the El Dorado bar.
[16453.37s -> 16455.37s]  It's not one of my places.
[16455.37s -> 16458.51s]  We used to buy fruit at the market.
[16458.51s -> 16460.51s]  Cut my throat shaving.
[16460.51s -> 16462.51s]  I think there was always one in his eyes all over my wife.
[16462.51s -> 16464.51s]  What's the name of this fruit market?
[16464.51s -> 16466.51s]  Just picked fruit.
[16466.51s -> 16468.51s]  Ord Street downtown.
[16468.51s -> 16472.03s]  One last question.
[16472.03s -> 16474.03s]  Do the words kiss the blood
[16474.03s -> 16476.20s]  mean anything to you?
[16476.20s -> 16478.20s]  Is this going to be my first perfect?
[16478.20s -> 16480.38s]  Sounds sick to me.
[16480.38s -> 16482.38s]  You're not in the clear by any means, Angel.
[16482.38s -> 16484.38s]  You're going back into a cell.
[16484.38s -> 16486.38s]  Can I get at least one perfect
[16486.38s -> 16488.38s]  and not have a C minus on everything?
[16488.38s -> 16490.38s]  The coroner says it's going to take
[16490.38s -> 16492.38s]  at least a week to get an ID.
[16492.38s -> 16494.38s]  I'm going to get zero out of four on the next one.
[16494.38s -> 16497.26s]  Just watch.
[16497.26s -> 16499.26s]  We need to go to the fruit market.
[16499.26s -> 16501.26s]  I recognize that guy from the papers.
[16501.26s -> 16504.08s]  He's a cop.
[16504.08s -> 16507.08s]  Heavens to Betsy!
[16507.08s -> 16512.20s]  You alright, lady?
[16512.20s -> 16514.57s]  Heavens to Betsy!
[16514.57s -> 16519.12s]  How do I get out of here?
[16519.12s -> 16521.55s]  I need something that says exit this way.
[16521.55s -> 16526.22s]  Oh, thank God.
[16526.22s -> 16535.44s]  Just picked fruit.
[16535.44s -> 16537.44s]  Didn't I try to go here already?
[16537.44s -> 16539.68s]  What's your read on Maldonado?
[16539.68s -> 16541.68s]  I still like him for it.
[16541.68s -> 16543.68s]  Seriously, that line about the guy at the fruit market
[16543.68s -> 16546.56s]  making eyes at his woman?
[16546.56s -> 16548.56s]  I'll get to the market and the guy behind the counter
[16548.56s -> 16550.56s]  will tell us he saw Angel drag his old lady off.
[16550.56s -> 16552.56s]  I wish I was a boomer.
[16552.56s -> 16554.56s]  What are you talking about?
[16554.56s -> 16556.56s]  Hey!
[16556.56s -> 16567.69s]  If someone reports this...
[16567.69s -> 16569.69s]  Somebody recording this.
[16569.69s -> 16584.16s]  I'm recording this.
[16584.16s -> 16587.74s]  Just picked fruit.
[16587.74s -> 16589.74s]  Why aren't I getting five stars?
[16589.74s -> 16591.74s]  I'm not a five-star driver.
[16591.74s -> 16593.74s]  I'm a five-star deductive analyst detective.
[16593.74s -> 16599.12s]  Bog, bog!
[16599.12s -> 16604.88s]  Stop throwing food.
[16604.88s -> 16612.43s]  Hey, you look like somebody that works here.
[16612.43s -> 16614.43s]  Sir, I'm the...
[16614.43s -> 16616.43s]  Wait, you look familiar.
[16616.43s -> 16619.18s]  Hey, from the bar, right?
[16619.18s -> 16621.61s]  Who brings you here?
[16621.61s -> 16623.61s]  LAPD.
[16623.61s -> 16625.61s]  Detective Phelps and Galloway.
[16625.61s -> 16627.61s]  Clem Feeney.
[16627.61s -> 16629.61s]  What can I do for you?
[16629.61s -> 16631.61s]  Did you happen to see a young woman last night?
[16631.61s -> 16633.61s]  21 years old, Hispanic?
[16633.61s -> 16636.11s]  Sure, she came by last night. Why do you ask?
[16636.11s -> 16638.41s]  Because...
[16638.41s -> 16641.23s]  She's dead.
[16641.23s -> 16643.23s]  She was wearing a necklace?
[16643.23s -> 16645.23s]  I didn't notice.
[16645.23s -> 16647.23s]  You weren't paying attention, Feeney?
[16647.23s -> 16654.76s]  Hey, you're getting the wrong idea.
[16654.76s -> 16656.76s]  He's doing the...
[16656.76s -> 16658.76s]  Blink, blink.
[16658.76s -> 16660.76s]  Eyes.
[16660.76s -> 16664.76s]  How much fruit do you sell here after midnight, Clem?
[16664.76s -> 16667.26s]  Uh, not much.
[16667.26s -> 16671.56s]  I sell the odd bottle on the side to the after-hours crowd.
[16671.56s -> 16673.56s]  I don't want any trouble. I'm just trying to make a buck.
[16673.56s -> 16676.70s]  Clem.
[16676.70s -> 16677.70s]  Feet.
[16677.70s -> 16678.70s]  Size.
[16678.70s -> 16681.07s]  Now.
[16681.07s -> 16683.07s]  The young lady arrived around midnight?
[16683.07s -> 16685.50s]  Yeah, something like that.
[16685.50s -> 16689.66s]  Used the phone for a cab and then left.
[16689.66s -> 16691.66s]  Got him.
[16691.66s -> 16693.66s]  You already knew Mrs. Maldonado, didn't you, Clem?
[16693.66s -> 16695.66s]  You make it very easy, while they just like...
[16695.66s -> 16697.66s]  Eyes dart back and forth.
[16697.66s -> 16701.66s]  Her husband went apeshit one day when he caught me talking to her.
[16701.66s -> 16704.22s]  She hadn't been back until last night.
[16704.22s -> 16708.51s]  Where did she go from here?
[16708.51s -> 16710.51s]  She wanted a cab, but I couldn't get her one.
[16710.51s -> 16714.94s]  I was about to offer to drive her, but a car pulled up and she got into that.
[16723.90s -> 16727.90s]  His eyes are not going crazy, but do I have?
[16727.90s -> 16739.29s]  But does that always mean that it's the truth?
[16739.29s -> 16741.29s]  Look, I got a lady's hat that you were wearing.
[16741.29s -> 16744.36s]  Can you describe the car?
[16744.36s -> 16746.54s]  Brown Ford Coupe, I think.
[16746.54s -> 16748.54s]  She seemed to know the guy.
[16748.54s -> 16751.10s]  Did I do it?
[16751.10s -> 16753.10s]  Do you mind if we look around?
[16753.10s -> 16755.10s]  Why would you want to do that?
[16755.10s -> 16757.10s]  No one has ever done this mission as good as me.
[16757.10s -> 16759.10s]  Don't you have to get a court order or something? I have rights.
[16759.10s -> 16767.87s]  Clem?
[16767.87s -> 16773.37s]  Boomer voice?
[16773.37s -> 16776.51s]  It's a Boomer thing.
[16776.51s -> 16779.58s]  It's like the Boomer meme thing.
[16779.58s -> 16782.08s]  Why, because I'm 33?
[16782.08s -> 16793.92s]  33?
[16793.92s -> 16797.05s]  What am I even looking for here?
[16797.05s -> 16804.22s]  Sorry, but you are a Boomer.
[16804.22s -> 16806.22s]  33 year old Boomer stream.
[16813.72s -> 16816.09s]  I just snapped at that lady's neck.
[16816.09s -> 16818.09s]  I put my hands up and everything.
[16818.09s -> 16830.89s]  What am I looking for?
[16830.89s -> 16835.50s]  Go in and register.
[16835.50s -> 16842.91s]  Ah, secret entrance.
[16842.91s -> 16845.08s]  Get their vitamins.
[16845.08s -> 16847.08s]  Check through this stuff before we get back out there.
[16847.08s -> 16850.67s]  Looking for meat?
[16850.67s -> 16853.04s]  Am I looking for meat?
[16853.04s -> 16856.43s]  What are you talking about?
[16856.43s -> 16858.80s]  So what are we hiding in here?
[16858.80s -> 16860.80s]  Found the meat.
[16860.80s -> 16862.97s]  This thing needs a combination.
[16862.97s -> 16864.97s]  Wait, I have that.
[16864.97s -> 16871.31s]  Clues.
[16871.31s -> 16878.03s]  2, 5, 3.
[16878.03s -> 16895.36s]  How do I change this?
[16895.36s -> 16897.36s]  Got it.
[16897.36s -> 16901.13s]  And this is the bracelet.
[16901.13s -> 16903.13s]  Reliquus, 522.
[16903.13s -> 16905.13s]  Wives submit to your husbands as to the lord.
[16905.13s -> 16907.13s]  23, for the husband is the head of the wife.
[16907.13s -> 16909.13s]  Christ is the head of the church.
[16909.13s -> 16911.13s]  His body of which he is the savior.
[16911.13s -> 16924.89s]  Hands.
[16924.89s -> 16933.00s]  Prayer hands.
[16933.00s -> 16935.24s]  That is the bracelet.
[16935.24s -> 16947.00s]  Got it.
[16947.00s -> 16952.76s]  Oh, tire iron.
[16952.76s -> 16956.73s]  And a scalpel.
[16956.73s -> 16959.66s]  I caught someone who was already dead.
[16959.66s -> 16962.22s]  Because he wanted to take their
[16962.22s -> 16964.52s]  body parts.
[16964.52s -> 16966.52s]  This step is dead.
[16966.52s -> 16969.15s]  The creep usually feels they can do whatever they like.
[16969.15s -> 16973.37s]  Must have seen it during the war.
[16973.37s -> 16975.37s]  This fruit stall punk gets about
[16975.37s -> 16977.37s]  10 seconds to explain before
[16977.37s -> 16979.37s]  he pulls his fucking arms off.
[16979.37s -> 16981.68s]  Clips.
[16981.68s -> 16991.85s]  I'm trying to shoot out his tires.
[16991.85s -> 16993.85s]  I'm trying to shoot out his tires.
[16993.85s -> 17005.88s]  I'm trying to shoot out his tires.
[17005.88s -> 17007.88s]  Trying to shoot his tires out.
[17007.88s -> 17009.88s]  This guy is just the tire shooter.
[17009.88s -> 17011.88s]  He doesn't do anything else.
[17011.88s -> 17013.88s]  I bring him along for his...
[17013.88s -> 17015.88s]  One party member that has like revived in the group.
[17017.88s -> 17019.88s]  Jump!
[17019.88s -> 17022.83s]  Nice.
[17037.32s -> 17039.32s]  Ah, that was going so cleanly.
[17043.32s -> 17045.32s]  Get the tire.
[17045.32s -> 17050.32s]  You idiot.
[17060.70s -> 17063.32s]  Alright, get it.
[17063.32s -> 17065.32s]  Hit him, Cole. Spin him out.
[17065.32s -> 17067.69s]  You shot him with a bumper, dude.
[17067.69s -> 17069.69s]  Keep it stabbing. I'm trying to bust his tires.
[17072.19s -> 17076.48s]  Did I kill him? No.
[17076.48s -> 17091.18s]  You're under arrest.
[17091.18s -> 17093.18s]  You're a sick man, Clem.
[17093.18s -> 17097.60s]  You need help.
[17097.60s -> 17099.60s]  Perfect? Did I get my first perfect?
[17099.60s -> 17101.60s]  Oh, no. Don't. Come on.
[17101.60s -> 17103.60s]  Is there more?
[17110.16s -> 17112.16s]  He wants to personally talk to everybody.
[17112.16s -> 17114.16s]  He wants to personally talk to everybody.
[17114.16s -> 17116.16s]  He wants to personally talk to everybody.
[17127.66s -> 17140.84s]  Just like throw him down on the ground.
[17140.84s -> 17146.60s]  Just start fucking cuffing him.
[17146.60s -> 17149.16s]  Oh, yes.
[17149.16s -> 17152.24s]  I did it.
[17152.24s -> 17154.24s]  17 and 17, 13 and 13.
[17154.24s -> 17156.24s]  That is an A plus.
[17156.24s -> 17158.60s]  But, with all the damage that brings it down to like an A minus, probably.
[17158.60s -> 17160.78s]  But, with all the damage that brings it down to like an A minus, probably.
[17160.78s -> 17168.46s]  Well, I'm going to get one.
[17168.46s -> 17170.46s]  Well, I'm going to get one.
[17192.46s -> 17194.46s]  You're sitting there field stripping a cigarette and suddenly he's there looking down on you.
[17194.46s -> 17196.46s]  You're sitting there field stripping a cigarette and suddenly he's there looking down on you.
[17196.46s -> 17198.46s]  You're sitting there field stripping a cigarette and suddenly he's there looking down on you.
[17198.46s -> 17200.46s]  Hello.
[17200.46s -> 17202.46s]  Why do you think we keep saluting that jab-loving son of a bitch with bad juju.
[17202.46s -> 17204.46s]  That's enough out of you three.

[20449.62s -> 20452.18s]  What is the why does it keep popping up in this spirit?
[20453.46s -> 20465.71s]  See that it's still possible to do it. It's down here
[20505.46s -> 20508.02s]  All right interrogation he's an interview too
[20508.98s -> 20514.02s]  Thanks. What do you make of him sailor on furlough? Who looks like he's in trouble and knows it
[20514.98s -> 20517.61s]  straight through the red light
[20518.97s -> 20526.97s]  Detectives felps and Galloway
[20527.29s -> 20531.29s]  We know why you're here. Jessup. So what would be best if you answered our questions truthfully?
[20532.30s -> 20534.30s]  I don't want any trouble. That's why i'm here
[20534.62s -> 20538.70s]  I heard on the radio about this lady getting killed. I got lead from my co to come down straight away
[20539.50s -> 20541.66s]  So why did you kill her?
[20541.66s -> 20543.66s]  I didn't kill anyone
[20543.98s -> 20546.86s]  Look, you need to believe me. Let's start at the beginning
[20549.86s -> 20551.86s]  contact, uh us
[20552.50s -> 20558.98s]  Maybe able sea man seen with victim on night of murder. You went to baron's bar. What time did you arrive?
[20559.54s -> 20564.04s]  I got a 24-hour pass. I got there around seven. That's where you met teresa tarrelton
[20565.14s -> 20566.02s]  Sure
[20566.02s -> 20568.02s]  We had a couple of drinks
[20572.76s -> 20578.76s]  So you tried to make a woman who was incredibly drunk look i'm not proud of myself, but I never hurt her
[20579.56s -> 20581.56s]  You took her dancing. That's right
[20582.04s -> 20584.04s]  Cut a cab to the crystal ballroom
[20585.11s -> 20587.26s]  That's true
[20587.26s -> 20590.54s]  Right. You had a fist fight with richard bates over mrs. Tarrelton
[20591.42s -> 20593.42s]  You met the guy. He's a creep
[20594.06s -> 20596.06s]  You should take a look at him for this
[20596.54s -> 20606.01s]  I mean he's pointing the finger directly at you jessup. I only had one night before I was back in the tub
[20606.49s -> 20610.33s]  He had all the time in the world to look for some action. I belted him. I'd do it again
[20610.97s -> 20615.95s]  She was better off with me. Sure. You're a shining example of chivalry jessup
[20617.96s -> 20621.96s]  Movements prior to murder. Where did you go after the crystal ballroom?
[20622.92s -> 20625.24s]  I think the wind had gone out of her sails by then
[20626.12s -> 20628.76s]  She caught a cab and I caught a cab and I got a bus
[20635.43s -> 20637.83s]  Uh, they started shaky at first but
[20638.79s -> 20642.36s]  No, no
[20642.36s -> 20644.36s]  They're not it's not he can't only
[20646.90s -> 20649.06s]  No, we spoke to the cab driver
[20649.70s -> 20652.34s]  Tell us what really happened at the crystal ballroom
[20652.98s -> 20655.56s]  I'd had enough
[20655.56s -> 20659.48s]  She was all upset about her husband bawling about her kids. She she looked old
[20660.52s -> 20662.52s]  Left around closing maybe 130
[20663.32s -> 20668.38s]  Got on a bus and she fell asleep on my shoulder. We've only told lies an all-american
[20668.86s -> 20673.82s]  249 he hasn't said anything else besides a lie place. She jumped off and I stayed on it downtown
[20674.54s -> 20679.50s]  After that, I caught another bus to san pedro. So that's probably also down there. She's being scrapped
[20679.98s -> 20682.94s]  And that was the last you saw of teresa. Yeah, that's right
[20683.98s -> 20686.46s]  We didn't say much. I think she was kind of embarrassed
[20689.80s -> 20695.40s]  Cab ride cab driver said that you were getting pretty familiar with teresa. It's not how i'd put it
[20696.36s -> 20702.48s]  But is that that is that his okay, so this is that he's telling the truth
[20703.60s -> 20705.60s]  You look at how confident he is right there
[20713.69s -> 20717.37s]  really
[20717.37s -> 20718.33s]  so
[20718.33s -> 20721.82s]  Wait a minute. Can I like accuse with the cab?
[20722.46s -> 20733.87s]  hire tracks
[20733.87s -> 20741.26s]  Well, okay the first three questions he was like his eyes were darting around and now all of a sudden he's like smiling
[20748.99s -> 20754.11s]  Tell the truth jessup. You're running out of time. You wanted to get laid and teresa wouldn't come across
[20754.51s -> 20757.95s]  It made you crazy. So you strangled her with a piece of rope
[20758.67s -> 20760.67s]  For christ's sake. That's not true
[20761.76s -> 20765.04s]  I felt sorry for her. What proof do you have that I strangled her?
[20771.21s -> 20773.21s]  The cab statement
[20775.74s -> 20777.74s]  We got you
[20778.06s -> 20780.41s]  In the cab
[20780.41s -> 20782.41s]  That's the proof. We have you took a cab
[20782.89s -> 20785.26s]  Wait, I can back out. I made a mistake
[20785.98s -> 20788.17s]  You can actually do that
[20788.17s -> 20795.45s]  Oh, okay, so the last thing you wanted was her playing hard to get did that make you mad sailor told every single thing
[20796.41s -> 20802.41s]  She knew what a guy's looking for all broads do dancing comes second. And what happened at the crystal ballroom?
[20803.29s -> 20808.49s]  Nothing, not even a little hand relief. She had another couple of drinks. There was no fun left in her
[20808.97s -> 20810.97s]  Just poured her guts out to some bartender
[20812.64s -> 20816.00s]  We're holding you till we can clear this with the driver. He literally did
[20816.08s -> 20819.04s]  Yeah, my co said as much didn't tell the truth every time
[20820.08s -> 20824.24s]  Can you put the guy in two in a cell and inform the commander? Sure detective. Okay
[20827.39s -> 20828.91s]  Got a message for you
[20828.91s -> 20834.59s]  Siding of your disfigured hobo on brand between temple and sunset and looks like the bow has a record too
[20834.83s -> 20837.95s]  He's wanted in connection with two female assault. Thanks

[20859.90s -> 20861.90s]  Still no hard evidence on any of them

[20895.53s -> 20916.01s]  Your sandwich is awesome. I love it
[20917.05s -> 20921.40s]  I could arguably say
[20921.40s -> 20923.40s]  That I could eat tuna fish every single day
[20924.04s -> 20929.12s]  I probably could
[20929.12s -> 20933.92s]  Satan like appears in front of me and it's like you can only eat tuna fish for the rest of your life
[20935.12s -> 20936.48s]  How do you plead?
[20936.48s -> 20938.08s]  I'm like guilty

[20987.55s -> 20989.55s]  Uh, just a minute
[20989.55s -> 20992.56s]  Do you like raw tuna? I do
[20994.22s -> 21000.54s]  Spicy tuna is probably my favorite role. Where can we find a restaurant frank is out on the seven four?
[21001.18s -> 21005.74s]  Can you tell us the route? Hang on? Uh, I'm should have I don't need it that often but
[21005.74s -> 21012.73s]  Yeah
[21012.73s -> 21015.69s]  I like raw tuna in the spicy tuna roll, but I don't like raw tuna
[21016.49s -> 21017.37s]  just
[21017.37s -> 21019.29s]  Eating raw tuna
[21019.29s -> 21021.29s]  I know that's a lot of people really like that
[21021.61s -> 21024.97s]  But not not for me. It's got to be in something else
[21025.69s -> 21033.52s]  I'll need to run the loop locate all-american 74
[21034.40s -> 21036.32s]  Route number 74
[21036.32s -> 21039.58s]  Do I have to memorize this or is this going to be on the map?
[21040.94s -> 21042.94s]  We're not going to drive the whole thing. Are we?
[21043.66s -> 21044.94s]  Won't take long
[21044.94s -> 21049.79s]  We have a siren
[21049.79s -> 21063.84s]  Okay, wait, I can't decide between the tuna fish and the chicken
[21064.48s -> 21065.80s]  uh
[21065.80s -> 21068.76s]  Tuna eat the tuna. That's the best one
[21071.93s -> 21088.73s]  What novels all-american 74? Let's go get him about the back door. God damn it
[21089.21s -> 21107.82s]  All right, so we just have to drive there this line
[21111.56s -> 21115.16s]  Okay, you get in the car like he's never in the car with shit
[21116.36s -> 21120.59s]  I'm just too fast with this guy
[21123.84s -> 21132.08s]  Get in okay looking for a bus
[21133.45s -> 21134.57s]  bus
[21134.57s -> 21136.57s]  74 could be a long trip col
[21137.29s -> 21142.89s]  Or it could be a short one and here's me without my hip flask and only a pain in the ass for company
[21143.05s -> 21148.81s]  Way to kick off the drive in high spirits rusty comments like that put me in just the right mood for some leg work
[21149.13s -> 21151.13s]  Touchy, you know what your problem is
[21151.37s -> 21156.01s]  You don't like hard work to find this kind of rigorous search is what police work is all about
[21156.49s -> 21160.41s]  Discipline say how big is the bus just as bored as I am
[21161.13s -> 21167.53s]  I'm sure i've seen a bus the whole game
[21168.41s -> 21169.61s]  let alone
[21169.61s -> 21171.53s]  Try to find one now
[21171.53s -> 21201.63s]  I'm currently driving with traffic. So that might be a problem
[21202.59s -> 21204.51s]  If so are they
[21204.51s -> 21216.65s]  No, i'm still no sign of him. Did you doze off rusty? I think you slept through my solving the case
[21216.89s -> 21222.09s]  Yeah, very funny. Just give me a nudge if you see him, right? How about you nudge me found that's a job
[21222.17s -> 21226.51s]  For your wife
[21226.51s -> 21230.43s]  That's the bus we're looking for ease in behind her and get her to the side of the road
[21243.36s -> 21247.07s]  All right. Yeah
[21247.07s -> 21249.96s]  Hello
[21249.96s -> 21252.78s]  There's some kind of problem buddy
[21252.92s -> 21258.70s]  LAPD we're investigating a murder you had a sailor and a woman in a green dress on your bus late last night
[21258.94s -> 21263.26s]  That's correct. And the woman got off first around 2 a.m. Yeah, that's right
[21263.74s -> 21269.34s]  And the sailor stayed on all the way to downtown. Can you tell us where you let the woman off on california street?
[21270.06s -> 21275.10s]  They tell you the truth. She looked a little lost like she got off on the wrong stop or something this voice
[21275.34s -> 21279.42s]  I didn't like dropping her off near that hobo camp. Who is that a big help? Mr. Zeffirelli?
[21280.30s -> 21282.30s]  I've heard it a million times
[21283.02s -> 21292.03s]  So sailor boy escaped by the seat of his bell bottom trousers left the broad alive
[21292.67s -> 21294.67s]  Left her by the hobo camp
[21294.83s -> 21296.83s]  Which means he's as good as kill
[21297.23s -> 21300.75s]  We can't eliminate any of them, but the disfigured man should be our starting point
[21301.39s -> 21306.75s]  I'm gonna call for some backup. These bows hate cops. These bows hate cops
[21307.55s -> 21309.55s]  um
[21309.55s -> 21311.55s]  Okay, so we're gonna
[21312.41s -> 21314.41s]  Go to the hobo camp
[21318.59s -> 21320.59s]  This is a long one
[21321.47s -> 21323.63s]  Breathe though breathe. Damn it
[21324.43s -> 21327.37s]  That was not danny devito
[21327.69s -> 21332.16s]  Danny devito, who are you getting that?

[21353.92s -> 21355.36s]  No

[21385.20s -> 21391.23s]  Is it weird that I don't like to have this on because I think it's too loud
[21392.99s -> 21419.66s]  It's annoying I'd rather deal with driving into people nice dodge there's a lightning reflexes there
[21439.34s -> 21442.46s]  We'd like a word with you save it for someone who's interested
[21443.42s -> 21444.94s]  They're fascist
[21445.02s -> 21450.70s]  Come to move us on and steal what little we have left six rounds won't get us far. Do you have a fire axe?
[21457.74s -> 21461.52s]  Um, these men know they're hovering a murderer
[21463.36s -> 21465.44s]  Beat up the main guy
[21465.44s -> 21470.08s]  I've seen every movie. I've seen every tv show every video game. Once you beat up the fucking boss everybody else stops

[21558.14s -> 21560.20s]  Mr. Sheldon
[21560.20s -> 21562.96s]  Good night, sir
[21562.96s -> 21570.32s]  Take a seat cortney
[21570.32s -> 21572.32s]  We need your help
[21572.32s -> 21573.68s]  jack
[21573.68s -> 21575.68s]  I told you I would have nothing to do with that
[21578.59s -> 21580.27s]  I'm fine, too jack
[21580.27s -> 21582.27s]  Medical school's going well
[21582.27s -> 21584.44s]  I got a part-time job
[21584.52s -> 21586.52s]  Do dope peddlers need part-time jobs?
[21587.32s -> 21589.63s]  We made a mistake and we're in trouble jack
[21590.67s -> 21594.35s]  A local gangster micky cohen is putting on the squeeze
[21595.69s -> 21602.01s]  So hand it over walk away. What's stopping you? We had a deal with them that they would dole it out slowly
[21602.65s -> 21608.25s]  They said they were the peanuts movie by the way clinics and doctors like but they've been moving it on to addicts
[21608.73s -> 21614.73s]  And they can't cope with the purity. So your problem is with gangsters being dishonest. My problem is that people are dying
[21615.29s -> 21618.81s]  And then if this gets back to us, we'll all end up in jail
[21620.67s -> 21626.75s]  So, how am I supposed to help cortney? This isn't the war. I can't just wave a magic wand and clean up your mess
[21628.03s -> 21635.32s]  due to negotiating
[21635.40s -> 21639.40s]  jack
[21639.40s -> 21642.60s]  The only thing these guys understand is force sheldon
[21643.40s -> 21648.04s]  They got to the top back east by proving to be more vicious than the english the irish and the dutch
[21648.12s -> 21651.56s]  I googled the exact day and exact moment of the movie coming up
[21651.72s -> 21653.00s]  Society
[21653.00s -> 21659.88s]  I'd say cortney you want to be a doctor. Give me another one. How can you fight with that?
[21660.84s -> 21663.60s]  We give me another year for a day
[21668.20s -> 21670.84s]  I didn't make it through the war to come back to this kind of shit sheldon
[21678.01s -> 21680.97s]  1999 17 made that herald and kumar go to white castle
[21702.51s -> 21704.51s]  16 years ago four days night before christmas
[21704.99s -> 21730.30s]  It's none of these ropes
[21730.30s -> 21735.34s]  Looks familiar safe bet it'll match the mark under teresa terrell three years ago sean of the dead
[21751.69s -> 21757.71s]  purse
[21757.71s -> 21758.99s]  last friday
[21758.99s -> 21759.95s]  venom
[21759.95s -> 21769.74s]  It doesn't look like much of a dancer
[21773.71s -> 21775.71s]  terregate stubert ackerman
[21775.71s -> 21804.32s]  Two years six months ago
[21808.09s -> 21813.53s]  Ah, damn that's got me though. Oh two years and six. It's the six months. That's getting me
[21814.25s -> 21819.77s]  The husband has an alibi, but no real motive other than neglect. Uh, the the antebell free
[21820.73s -> 21822.73s]  antebell for whatever it was
[21823.13s -> 21825.69s]  Pulling the same stick antebell for the doll is back
[21826.41s -> 21828.41s]  Not you're gonna kill us
[21828.49s -> 21835.32s]  Have the evidence we know she was here
[21835.80s -> 21838.44s]  All we need is a confession. We can charge the bum with murder
[21852.24s -> 21853.68s]  I mean, no
[21853.68s -> 21856.30s]  I'm just saying when movies came
[21856.78s -> 21862.41s]  All right. Fine. You guys think you're so smart
[21863.69s -> 21868.01s]  Let's go you got I i'm gonna if you take more than five seconds here, then you go there
[21868.65s -> 21872.75s]  One of the mighty ducks come out the first one
[21872.91s -> 21889.79s]  We're going this way
[21890.43s -> 21892.43s]  I don't even know. I don't know
[21892.83s -> 21894.19s]  No guns
[21894.19s -> 21899.63s]  I need to where's the interrogation room?
[21903.50s -> 21905.50s]  Follow interview room one
[21906.67s -> 21909.15s]  Ackerman you were in the marines. How do you know?
[21910.03s -> 21914.27s]  The corps selected big guys for flamethrower duty. That's how you got the burns
[21915.15s -> 21918.43s]  Life expectancy was five minutes for guy in flamethrower detail
[21919.15s -> 21924.51s]  What kind of a government puts weight like that on a man's shoulders? You'll get no argument from me
[21925.23s -> 21926.83s]  It was a heavy load
[21926.83s -> 21928.83s]  You feel like somebody actually got it?
[21931.50s -> 21934.54s]  Okay, how about this one guys willard? I need a year and a day
[21948.22s -> 21951.63s]  Okay, nice job. Why did you kill mrs. Terreltson?
[21952.96s -> 21955.60s]  I have no recollection of the people I have killed
[21956.72s -> 21958.72s]  Why lie lie?
[21960.60s -> 21962.60s]  You hate women ackerman
[21967.36s -> 21969.36s]  How much did you hate mrs. Terreltson?
[21970.60s -> 21972.84s]  I ache to put my seed in them
[21973.40s -> 21974.92s]  I have guards
[21974.92s -> 21979.00s]  We use for them. Okay
[21980.54s -> 21982.96s]  so
[21982.96s -> 21988.36s]  So you did it a bus driver dropped mrs. Terreltson near your camp around 2 a.m
[21988.52s -> 21991.00s]  Why did you take her up to the hill? Which hill?
[21992.28s -> 21994.04s]  I have many places
[21994.04s -> 22001.15s]  I go where I please
[22001.31s -> 22008.51s]  You're clearly insane ackerman the state of california does not execute mental patients. I don't know the names of the women i've killed
[22009.31s -> 22013.65s]  But i've killed many of them. So this is the guy their necks are so fragile
[22015.07s -> 22018.11s]  This is the guy this is the dude he's the guy that's killing all the people
[22018.99s -> 22024.49s]  Where were you around 2 a.m. Last night?
[22025.29s -> 22029.42s]  at the camp
[22029.42s -> 22031.42s]  Hold on. What what do we got?
[22031.42s -> 22033.64s]  2 a.m
[22033.64s -> 22035.64s]  At the camp we brought her up there
[22035.80s -> 22038.44s]  Laundry boots. Well, what's what about his shoe size?
[22039.16s -> 22062.08s]  The rope the boat though, where are the tire the tire tracks?
[22063.36s -> 22067.16s]  Turned tire tracks on muddy ground close to body. This got into a car
[22068.12s -> 22074.91s]  What are you staring at boy?
[22083.29s -> 22084.73s]  bus driver frank
[22084.73s -> 22087.05s]  Testifies to dropping teresa near the camp
[22088.25s -> 22090.25s]  rope matching
[22090.41s -> 22093.21s]  Put your mark on victim's neck found in ackerman's lean to
[22094.91s -> 22099.31s]  And this is found in stuart ackerman's lean to her purse and the rope that killed her
[22100.19s -> 22104.33s]  So wouldn't it be like the rope that killed her?
[22105.05s -> 22120.16s]  I mean, that's that's obvious
[22120.40s -> 22122.40s]  I wanted you to take one of the other ones away
[22131.34s -> 22135.58s]  You were up on the hill you were seen during the day. We have a witness. We have evidence
[22135.58s -> 22138.62s]  You got the blood on me ackerman and i'll see what I can do for you
[22139.68s -> 22141.68s]  I despise your pity
[22141.84s -> 22143.84s]  You have nothing that links me to this woman
[22144.40s -> 22150.33s]  Did he get rid of the rope?
[22150.41s -> 22155.07s]  Oh shit
[22155.07s -> 22157.39s]  It's not his boots. He doesn't have a car
[22158.19s -> 22166.32s]  This is the only other thing
[22166.57s -> 22167.85s]  but just
[22167.85s -> 22172.30s]  I was gonna say the rope
[22172.30s -> 22176.86s]  We have you cold ackerman her purse and the ballroom ticket were in your lean to
[22177.50s -> 22179.50s]  Tell us why you did it
[22179.58s -> 22182.14s]  I kill because people need killing
[22182.94s -> 22184.94s]  That's what I was trained to do
[22187.63s -> 22192.29s]  Stuart yeah, i'm charging you with the murder of teresa taroldson
[22200.12s -> 22202.12s]  Does that he did he do the all the other ones too then?
[22202.76s -> 22215.24s]  He's innocent a man down on his lot. I can abide
[22216.12s -> 22220.44s]  But a filthy red who chooses to live outside the rules of society. I cannot stomach
[22221.84s -> 22224.56s]  Maybe poor threes or taroldson will provide the catalyst we need
[22225.74s -> 22231.18s]  I've spoken to the chief and the mayor and I think it's time we send some men in to remove the godless and send them
[22231.18s -> 22233.18s]  On the way over the county line
[22233.18s -> 22235.48s]  A grand day that will be gentlemen
[22235.88s -> 22237.88s]  And a grand result you have brought me
[22238.36s -> 22240.94s]  You two are fast becoming my finest crusaders
[22241.64s -> 22249.60s]  Hey, thanks
[22249.60s -> 22252.41s]  Oh
[22252.41s -> 22254.41s]  15 out of 17
[22255.05s -> 22260.75s]  The tarltons might have just as steward ackerman is pronounced fit to stand trial
[22262.19s -> 22272.68s]  I feel like the last two
[22272.84s -> 22277.56s]  Crimes were the two crazy people that were like I did it. It was me
[22278.76s -> 22298.86s]  You know what I mean?
[22298.86s -> 22301.23s]  Did I fall for the trick?
[22314.43s -> 22326.33s]  This torched zone studio secretary murder will have to be for another time
[22327.13s -> 22340.70s]  Maybe tomorrow. It's getting late. We'll see how it starts though
[22342.22s -> 22346.12s]  Again, we got to see his face this time
[22347.32s -> 22360.70s]  Of course, we will look into it. Yes. I'm aware that it's an election year. Keep a hold of your heart counciler
[22361.42s -> 22363.42s]  Now is not the time to lose your nerve
[22365.87s -> 22372.06s]  It would appear that someone has hooked a rose gold wedding ring a matching engagement ring sound familiar
[22372.38s -> 22373.74s]  Deirdre muller
[22373.74s -> 22379.21s]  Press the pawn broker and see what you can find out. The address is 348 south main street
[22380.22s -> 22384.62s]  The muller case goes before the grand jury next week and the da does not want any egg on his face
[22385.58s -> 22388.30s]  Then get out to the railroad depot on santa fe avenue
[22389.18s -> 22394.14s]  We have another poor unfortunate found this morning beside a railroad line. Yeah, at what point is it like?
[22395.10s -> 22398.46s]  Right skipper, this is a serial killer
[22400.19s -> 22402.75s]  My partner just doesn't seem to want to connect those dots
[22403.63s -> 22405.63s]  No, it's all just coincidences. There's
[22406.43s -> 22410.51s]  steve's taking the wedding rings and just letting their throats and choking them with
[22411.47s -> 22413.47s]  And deirdre muller's ring
[22414.57s -> 22417.61s]  All right, that is going to be it for tonight
[22419.34s -> 22421.34s]  Uh, I will

[22989.68s -> 22992.24s]  Same exact concept and it's so easy to use it really is
[22993.42s -> 23007.71s]  You just blend it and you turn it upside down take the top off and drink out of it sponsored sponsored by ninja
[23008.59s -> 23011.08s]  Uh, no, not quite but thanks a lot, man

[23028.19s -> 23035.02s]  Have you ever tried playing the fighting fantasy books on stream? No, because the fighting fantasy books are very complicated
[23036.05s -> 23037.31s]  And
[23037.31s -> 23039.15s]  I don't know if they transition
[23039.15s -> 23043.31s]  Well to being on video because it's a it's an actual book in dice and
[23044.03s -> 23047.95s]  It would be very very hard for me to learn that and stream it at the same time
[23048.19s -> 23050.75s]  I just I don't know if that would be good stream content
[23054.80s -> 23059.76s]  But if you're curious fighting fantasy is the source is the sorcery. It's made by the same person
[23060.16s -> 23068.50s]  If you're curious of what they're asking here, but thank you. I just don't think it would
[23069.20s -> 23074.86s]  Transition well, but thank you. I'm in for the one dollar
[23075.60s -> 23080.30s]  Uh, thank you the long egg for the five dollars here. Thank you long egg

[23090.98s -> 23092.66s]  Happening pretty soon
[23092.66s -> 23097.60s]  I'll let you guys know the exact date, but I need to lock it down for either this weekend
[23097.60s -> 23099.60s]  Like I said, or probably monday or tuesday
[23100.58s -> 23106.82s]  Uh, but good luck on your surgery. I'm not sure if it's um, anything that's uh serious or
[23107.79s -> 23113.98s]  A difficult surgery or anything, but good luck to you. Wish you the best. Thank you so much for the five dollars
[23119.78s -> 23121.78s]  Uh, we also have
[23121.78s -> 23126.67s]  Hawkeye of mine gave the twelve dollars earlier at the top of all the other money

[23152.29s -> 23153.62s]  Thank you
[23153.62s -> 23155.87s]  And I think i'm getting the hang of it
[23155.87s -> 23158.03s]  Once I figured out that you just have to find the thing
[23158.75s -> 23163.63s]  The one thing it's not like oh, let's I'm I investigated the crime scene. I have to talk about all those things
[23165.39s -> 23167.23s]  I'm I I get it

[23193.68s -> 23195.68s]  You don't read resub messages
[23197.74s -> 23199.10s]  uh
[23199.10s -> 23204.94s]  I would be breaking my number one rule. Unfortunately, uh kirenski. I I don't I will not watch rat movie on stream

[23258.24s -> 23263.49s]  How do you still have it memorized?
[23264.42s -> 23267.22s]  It's only like four lines and I recorded it
[23269.89s -> 23278.61s]  How the hell do you remember that thing that was three sentences that you recorded it was on the wasp stream
[23283.17s -> 23287.17s]  You're always drunk when you stream. That's your gimmick. I never ever
[23288.40s -> 23290.80s]  Maybe like once every two months
[23291.44s -> 23294.24s]  Once every like two or three months. I'll have a couple of drinks
[23295.92s -> 23301.92s]  Or drink two bottles of champagne or like a bottle of liquor like for labo. Look it happens sometimes
[23308.64s -> 23310.64s]  Once every month you aren't drunk

[23327.09s -> 23328.85s]  Thank you redhead arama
[23328.85s -> 23330.85s]  Glad you can enjoy
[23331.34s -> 23335.18s]  Watching the streams even when they're not live or the videos that are on the second channel
[23337.23s -> 23339.47s]  Thank you for even participating at all. Thank you
[23340.69s -> 23346.78s]  And it's good to see you again. We don't talk about the labo streams. Well, I had fun
[23348.30s -> 23352.30s]  My favorite take from the labo streams was the first night that I did it
[23352.30s -> 23355.42s]  I was getting I was like drunk and I was having a ton of fun
[23356.30s -> 23361.25s]  and then the next time it was like people were yelling at me and people being very mean to me and
[23361.73s -> 23363.81s]  I wasn't drunk and somebody said dude
[23363.89s -> 23367.89s]  You were just having fun the first night and we weren't and you just didn't care because you were drunk
[23368.13s -> 23374.26s]  And I was laughing my ass off about it. Like i'm having so much fun and everyone's like this is awful
[23377.20s -> 23383.73s]  Not everybody just like 20 percent of everybody I would do it again, too
[23383.81s -> 23386.77s]  I'm not kidding if there was if there was another labo, I would build it tomorrow
[23388.30s -> 23392.38s]  Just wait until the stupid car comes out and I do that again for like eight hours
[23397.46s -> 23401.41s]  I'm going to do it again. But this time i'm gonna do it like in the wind
[23402.82s -> 23405.06s]  I'll go on location and try to build the labo
[23405.70s -> 23420.50s]  On some mountain in nevada and like just extreme winds and try to do it. But thank you
[23421.06s -> 23423.46s]  Thank you hawkeye of mine again for three dollars
[23425.55s -> 23430.67s]  Uh, your stream's addictive man. I gave my goodbye bits but stuck around so here's the rest of my pocket change again

[23440.54s -> 23441.98s]  Sit here and enjoy it
[23441.98s -> 23446.21s]  Because I enjoy it too

[23454.13s -> 23455.71s]  Okay

[23462.94s -> 23465.26s]  It came out in september. Oh boy. Okay
[23466.93s -> 23471.65s]  Yeah
[23471.65s -> 23473.65s]  You you shouldn't have told me that
[23475.33s -> 23482.85s]  I'm gonna be the only guy on twitch that's built them all if you recommend any rpgs. Absolutely chrono trigger
[23483.33s -> 23485.82s]  super mario rpg, uh
[23486.62s -> 23489.25s]  lost odyssey, um
[23491.14s -> 23498.67s]  Chrono cross except not really you really have to be into it. That's pretty much it
[23502.62s -> 23504.62s]  Undertale that's another that's good, too
[23505.18s -> 23511.90s]  Just don't ever type undertale into google because you'll you just play it just play it and don't like go go look up anything
[23512.62s -> 23514.80s]  Just enjoy it for what it is
[23517.68s -> 23520.88s]  Sounds like i'll be playing some of those. Oh, they're some of the best rpgs ever made
[23521.44s -> 23522.56s]  Lost odyssey not so much
[23522.56s -> 23526.08s]  But that's just like a recent one that came out on xbox and it was pretty good
[23528.77s -> 23531.65s]  Uh, but dark soul. Thank you for those two dollars dark soul. Hey germa
[23531.65s -> 23535.97s]  You're my first sub and donation ever and when I make more money, I will happily donate more
[23537.10s -> 23541.18s]  You've been through so many phases in my life from when I was at my lower points to my highest peaks
[23541.66s -> 23546.62s]  Keep doing what you're doing because you make my life and so many others full of joy and laughter from even the shortest of streams
[23546.94s -> 23555.44s]  That means a lot. Thank you
[23555.44s -> 23557.01s]  uh
[23557.01s -> 23563.65s]  People that laugh together last together means a lot
[23564.37s -> 23572.34s]  Thank you so much guys and honey chain at the very end. Thanks for the one dollar germa heart. Thank you
[23577.76s -> 23581.01s]  Why am I getting booed?
[23581.01s -> 23583.01s]  Why am I getting booed? Why are you booing me?
[23590.69s -> 23595.02s]  Boo, let's get the credits on here before we end and I will see you guys tomorrow
[23596.08s -> 23598.08s]  With the nintendo labo vehicle kit
[23598.80s -> 23600.80s]  What if I just fucking did that?
[23600.96s -> 23602.64s]  There's a ton of people
[23602.64s -> 23605.04s]  more than half of the audience leaves
[23605.84s -> 23610.64s]  During this portion how fucking mad do you think everyone would be if I turned the stream on and it was the labo
[23610.64s -> 23618.00s]  I was doing it tomorrow
[23618.00s -> 23620.00s]  Part of me kind of wants to do that
[23620.16s -> 23621.92s]  But I don't know
[23621.92s -> 23625.68s]  I got you know, I kind of think i'm just gonna play la noir for like 30 minutes
[23626.72s -> 23631.60s]  And then i'm just gonna turn the webcam on and it's the labo behind me and we're just gonna pivot immediately to it for eight hours
[23649.17s -> 23651.17s]  Don't tell anybody
[23651.25s -> 23653.25s]  Well, uh, what time is it? It's
[23653.92s -> 23656.16s]  I'm maybe I can run to like the store
[23657.76s -> 23659.92s]  vegas never turns off man
[23659.92s -> 23664.56s]  I can I can go to the store at like midnight and like go get anything I want
[23668.05s -> 23670.93s]  Oh, would that be that would be such a I think i'm gonna i'm gonna do it
[23671.81s -> 23674.37s]  That sounds like just stupid enough for me to happy be happy with it
[23675.01s -> 23682.18s]  We'll see we'll see if I can get it
[23682.18s -> 23686.34s]  I'm just gonna play la noir for like 25 minutes and then i'm just gonna pan back
[23688.10s -> 23690.10s]  And that's it build the labo
[23692.96s -> 23697.28s]  Or am I what have I got sucked into yeah, like well it'll just be it'll just be ready behind me
[23698.08s -> 23699.84s]  Over the next couple of days
[23699.84s -> 23709.18s]  All right. We'll try
[23709.18s -> 23711.74s]  But let's run the uh credits
[23712.26s -> 23716.00s]  All the new subs and old subs. Thank you everybody here they come
[23718.37s -> 23720.37s]  Thank you all of you for supporting the stream as always
[23722.93s -> 23724.93s]  Every single one of you are all fucking amazing
[23727.17s -> 23729.49s]  Just start making just make labo puns the whole time
[23731.17s -> 23732.54s]  Yeah
[23732.54s -> 23738.78s]  You guys you guys really gotta keep uh quiet on this though because i'm gonna just reference cardboard and shit for like the first 20 minutes
[23749.06s -> 23753.62s]  I'll like bump into somebody a crash and oh that guy really crashed like crushed like a piece of cardboard
[23754.34s -> 23762.43s]  I mean nintendo really is like such an interesting company making like all these new things that people like played on stream
[23768.16s -> 23770.88s]  This is cool, how did I do this? This is actually part of stream labs
[23771.52s -> 23774.42s]  Um, it's not as detailed as I might like it to be
[23777.54s -> 23780.82s]  If i'm honest because you can really only do one thing and that's just scroll everybody
[23780.82s -> 23784.50s]  I wish it was possible to separate, uh by length of time subscribed
[23788.67s -> 23790.67s]  Why don't I read the credits anymore?
[23790.99s -> 23792.99s]  Well, there's two reasons
[23792.99s -> 23794.75s]  the first reason is
[23794.75s -> 23796.75s]  um, I think the the schtick of
[23797.85s -> 23799.31s]  screaming out
[23799.31s -> 23800.67s]  names
[23800.67s -> 23802.67s]  As as fast as I can
[23802.75s -> 23804.83s]  It's kind of uh, it's kind of over
[23805.55s -> 23807.55s]  And the second thing is there's so many of them though
[23810.27s -> 23812.35s]  So many people are subscribed to this channel now that it's
[23813.25s -> 23815.25s]  Uh, I I can't even fucking believe it
[23822.19s -> 23824.43s]  it's truly truly unbelievable
[23828.19s -> 23831.63s]  And uh, it's not going away. It's just changing
[23832.64s -> 23834.80s]  Because over the next probably month or so
[23835.76s -> 23837.76s]  There's gonna be something that happens at the end of the streams
[23838.66s -> 23840.66s]  In this spot right here
[23841.31s -> 23845.79s]  There's gonna be some fairly fun little interesting things that are not
[23846.59s -> 23848.59s]  It's not gonna be oh i'm gonna
[23848.75s -> 23854.03s]  Pick out some subs and they're like they're i'm gonna like shout them out. No, it'll be just something interesting
[23854.59s -> 23872.24s]  So there will be something fun at the end of streams that includes all the people that subscribe during that stream
[23872.88s -> 23878.56s]  You touched on this before I remember
[23878.64s -> 23881.55s]  yeah
[23881.55s -> 23884.99s]  it's tough because I really I want people to understand that like I really
[23885.61s -> 23887.61s]  appreciate and care that they're
[23887.79s -> 23889.79s]  Giving me their hard-earned money every month
[23890.35s -> 23895.79s]  Some of you guys like I'm treated like a netflix subscription, right? Like it's just people have been subscribed for years
[23896.83s -> 23900.03s]  And I never wanted people to think that I just oh, hey, thanks. Bye
[23900.75s -> 23904.18s]  That's why but I did something about just reading names
[23905.06s -> 23907.06s]  Doesn't do enough for me anymore
[23907.38s -> 23910.18s]  I'd like to try to do something fun
[23910.18s -> 23912.34s]  So just give me some time. I'll figure it out
[23922.26s -> 23929.62s]  But much love to you all
[23929.62s -> 23932.66s]  When is season five coming out season five of what?
[23937.47s -> 23939.63s]  Give me an attaboy for my support
[23942.59s -> 23948.90s]  Yeah, and I think there's like two different ways to do like subscriptions and bits and everything
[23950.48s -> 23953.20s]  and i've always been of the opinion that i'd like to keep it as
[23954.24s -> 23962.06s]  sort of like away from the stream as possible because my I my adhd is impossible to
[23962.78s -> 23966.14s]  Keep up with and i'd like to have them kind of just separated
[23966.78s -> 23971.74s]  in a way
[23971.74s -> 23975.54s]  If that makes sense, I hope it does
[23975.54s -> 23980.94s]  Can't wait for the season of fortnight. Are they in like season six or seven of fortnight?
[23981.42s -> 23989.58s]  I'm subbed to other people and when they read messages as they're sent, it's really out of place
[23990.54s -> 23992.54s]  well, I mean it really depends because I mean
[23993.34s -> 23995.42s]  the the only issue I ever had with it was
[23996.37s -> 24002.21s]  You know when when it's one person when it's two people, okay, I mean whatever that's easy to do
[24002.85s -> 24006.21s]  when it turns into like a hundred two hundred people potentially on a stream, it's
[24007.42s -> 24013.98s]  You know had a sub message notification comes up potentially every you know, 30 to 40 seconds every minute every two minutes
[24015.17s -> 24019.57s]  I've had streams where 400 people subscribed and it was like holy shit
[24022.10s -> 24024.10s]  And it's it's hard to balance between
[24024.10s -> 24025.22s]  I mean
[24025.22s -> 24029.78s]  I want people to know that I care and that I thank them and that they it means a fucking lot to me
[24029.78s -> 24031.70s]  but at the same time
[24031.70s -> 24032.82s]  there's
[24032.82s -> 24035.62s]  There's a stream to do you know what I mean? I would like to stream
[24037.86s -> 24039.54s]  It's something I think about a lot
[24039.54s -> 24044.78s]  The animation froze what did it?
[24045.02s -> 24054.30s]  So that's why over the years i've tried to come up with things to do like the end of the stream here
[24054.46s -> 24056.46s]  We sit and we relax and talk about you know
[24056.46s -> 24061.82s]  all the people that have donated money and I want to touch upon them and the subscription credits and
[24062.78s -> 24067.79s]  There'll always be something like that. I just have to figure out as if the channel continues to grow
[24069.15s -> 24071.47s]  more solutions and more things to do to try
[24076.80s -> 24077.84s]  but uh
[24077.84s -> 24082.64s]  That is for another day. I will see you guys tomorrow for the nintendo labo stream
[24084.70s -> 24086.70s]  I'm gonna piss a lot of people off
[24090.13s -> 24096.59s]  It's it has to happen though. Thanks a lot guys. See you tomorrow
[24097.57s -> 24099.57s]  Take care. Have a great rest of your night
