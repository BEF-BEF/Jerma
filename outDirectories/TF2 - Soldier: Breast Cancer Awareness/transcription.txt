[3.45s -> 15.04s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary like you know it.
[15.04s -> 22.04s]  Using the Soldier in this gameplay with the default rocket launcher, the equalizer, and the strange shotgun.
[22.04s -> 27.54s]  And I think for the remainder of this gameplay, I'm going to speak like this.
[27.54s -> 32.02s]  Casey Casem. If any of you know who Casey Casem is, that's kind of how we used to talk.
[32.02s -> 35.32s]  I'm Casey Casem. He was real weirdo.
[35.32s -> 42.50s]  But anyways, yeah, this is a gameplay commentary on Nucleus. King of the Hill Nucleus, even though there is not another type of Nucleus.
[42.50s -> 47.67s]  I wish there was though. Imagine if there was like five control point Nucleus.
[47.67s -> 53.04s]  Alright, let's get right into this here.
[53.04s -> 59.58s]  Rocket jump over to the middle point here. What was I doing? Can anybody tell me why I did that?
[59.58s -> 65.89s]  I'm one of those people that when they rocket jump, they do it at completely inappropriate times.
[65.89s -> 71.06s]  And when you really shouldn't be doing it at all. I never rocket jump when I'm supposed to.
[71.06s -> 74.06s]  I only rocket jump when I'm just being like an idiot.
[74.06s -> 77.24s]  Oh hey, I can just like jump over to the middle point.
[77.24s -> 80.24s]  Yahoo! Woohoo! Yeah!
[80.24s -> 83.24s]  I'll never do that again, I promise.
[83.24s -> 88.24s]  So I'm spamming over at the middle point here. No one's even gotten onto the point. Three minutes, three minutes.
[88.24s -> 91.42s]  This was also on a 32-person server.
[91.42s -> 98.42s]  And if you're aware, 32-player servers and Nucleus, or any King of the Hill map for that matter,
[98.42s -> 102.42s]  is pretty much complete and total insanity.
[102.42s -> 109.59s]  It's just crazy. 16 on 16, especially when they're full, it gets out of hand so quickly,
[109.59s -> 115.01s]  where you'll be walking out of the spawn and just... everything just kills you.
[115.01s -> 119.01s]  Ridiculous. I hate playing on King of the Hill maps with 16 on 16.
[119.01s -> 124.18s]  But you know, you're given a take. It can be fun sometimes, especially if you're playing a spam class.
[124.18s -> 131.81s]  Because once like 15 people get on the point, you can just lob four stickies over and kill a million people.
[131.81s -> 136.81s]  So we now have the point captured. 2.35 minutes left to go.
[136.81s -> 139.81s]  And I gotta commend this engineer that's behind us.
[139.81s -> 143.81s]  You'll see where the dispenser is. Absolutely fantastic.
[143.81s -> 147.81s]  I've never done this, but this is a great idea. It's level three.
[147.81s -> 151.30s]  And it's just healing everyone that comes over here. It's awesome.
[151.30s -> 157.30s]  This is one of the reasons why we're continuing to win, because this engineer has a fantastic dispenser.
[157.30s -> 162.48s]  Really guys, try that out. I'm excited to do that the next time I'm on this map.
[162.48s -> 165.48s]  You should be too, because it looks really fun.
[165.48s -> 168.98s]  And engineer's the best class in the entire game. Let's keep going, huh?
[168.98s -> 173.98s]  So as you know, some of you don't, but a lot of you do, this month is breast cancer awareness month.
[173.98s -> 178.98s]  And I really want to do something besides getting pain trained in the face, like just happened right there.
[178.98s -> 182.98s]  I want to do something interesting. I want to do something to kind of support the cause.
[182.98s -> 187.34s]  And it's not going to cost anybody any money. Just something really interesting I wanted to try and do.
[187.34s -> 193.65s]  So what I want to do, guys, is at some point in the next, probably the next few days or the next week or something,
[193.65s -> 199.95s]  I want to get a full server in my server, line up everybody, both blue team and red team,
[199.95s -> 206.19s]  somewhere maybe in bad water, a big, big open map, and have 32, actually I have a 24 person server,
[206.19s -> 211.19s]  so 24 people standing kind of in a group, all with a painted pink hat on.
[211.19s -> 215.19s]  And I want to just take a picture, put it somewhere, post it online somewhere just to say,
[215.19s -> 218.19s]  hey, look at Team Fortress 2, the community, we're all for this.
[218.19s -> 222.19s]  And I think it would be really interesting, because pink is in the game, you can paint your hat.
[222.19s -> 226.19s]  So if you don't have a pink hat or if you don't have pink paint,
[226.19s -> 231.19s]  maybe we could set up some type of donation system where if you have pink paint, you can send it over my way.
[231.19s -> 236.19s]  Or, guys, I'm willing just to buy 24 pink paints from the store.
[236.19s -> 240.19s]  It really doesn't matter to me. I think it just would be something really fun and interesting.
[240.19s -> 243.19s]  So yeah, we'll figure that out as time goes, but that's just something I wanted to throw out there,
[243.19s -> 246.19s]  something I wanted to do. We'll see how that goes.
[246.19s -> 252.19s]  And also, I'm going to be upping my upload schedule. It used to be about three or four times a week.
[252.19s -> 257.19s]  Now, guys, I'm going to try and really, really push for four or five uploads a week.
[257.19s -> 260.19s]  I know you guys want me to do more content. You guys ask me.
[260.19s -> 265.80s]  I get PMs all the time saying, hey, Germa, you should really upload more than three times a week.
[265.80s -> 268.80s]  And I can totally understand that, guys. I completely understand.
[268.80s -> 275.04s]  I'm going to try my best to keep this channel inspired, to keep the quality bar, the content bar,
[275.04s -> 279.41s]  as high as it can be and pump out five videos a week.
[279.41s -> 282.41s]  Maybe I'll take a break here and there one day or something like that,
[282.41s -> 285.41s]  but I want to do at least one video every other day.
[285.41s -> 291.41s]  I never wanted to get to a point where the channel is just me pumping out videos just to make them.
[291.41s -> 296.41s]  When I sit down, guys, to make a video, I want to make sure I'm really inspired to do it,
[296.41s -> 298.41s]  because this is a whole lot of fun to me.
[298.41s -> 302.41s]  And I would never want this fun to get dragged down into hell.
[302.41s -> 305.71s]  So don't expect any quality degradation.
[305.71s -> 310.08s]  This is just me telling you, be on the lookout for more content, baby.
[310.08s -> 313.08s]  Go watch the 4,000 subscriber video.
[313.08s -> 316.08s]  It's probably not in your sub box anymore, because I'm an idiot,
[316.08s -> 319.08s]  and I uploaded it at like one in the morning.
[319.08s -> 322.26s]  So it'll probably be knocked out of your sub box by now,
[322.26s -> 329.78s]  especially if you like Burger Boy, because Burger Boy makes his triumphant return as the egg.
[329.78s -> 331.78s]  So what are you guys doing for Halloween?
[331.78s -> 334.95s]  That video was kind of made in the spirit of Halloween.
[334.95s -> 337.95s]  What is your costume going to be, and do you have any ideas?
[337.95s -> 342.95s]  Because me, Burger Boy, an exoskeleton bug body who you've never seen or met before,
[342.95s -> 345.95s]  we're trying to figure out our costumes.
[345.95s -> 348.95s]  It's getting kind of late, so let me know what you're doing and your ideas.
[348.95s -> 352.19s]  That is going to be the end of this video, guys.
[352.19s -> 355.19s]  Thank you so much for watching. I really appreciate it.
[355.19s -> 358.19s]  I will see you all next time, and take care, everybody.
