[94.07s -> 99.83s]  What do you think about the new track? This is not replacing the starting soon screen, by the way.
[100.47s -> 107.88s]  I just kind of really wanted you to listen to it. I think it's great. I think it's really good.
[112.28s -> 118.73s]  Bloordow made some new things, as you can probably see. We have new sub badges.
[119.37s -> 125.58s]  We have a bunch of new music. Is it gonna be on? I got a lot. We'll go through them.
[125.58s -> 134.07s]  Well, no, maybe not. Maybe you should be surprised. Time for a new season.
[134.47s -> 138.76s]  I'm one hour late because of Daylight Savings.
[140.76s -> 144.54s]  Now, what I meant to say was, yes, I value what you just said.
[145.66s -> 148.70s]  But we live in a world where we move our clocks around.
[149.50s -> 153.14s]  I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It was a joke. I'm kidding.
[153.94s -> 163.74s]  All right, let's turn this down. Yeah, that's one of the new tracks. There are four new tracks.
[163.74s -> 169.58s]  Let's put the old one on. Here's the old one.
[169.98s -> 182.52s]  And Bloordow just, honestly, somebody got to hire Bloordow to make a whole game soundtrack.
[184.02s -> 189.96s]  When I listen to these songs that he makes, I'm thinking of indie games that would just,
[190.52s -> 195.24s]  he'd probably win fucking music of the year if he actually got onto a game or something.
[197.19s -> 201.03s]  He would win soundtrack of the year if he was able to just kind of go wild and do whatever he
[201.03s -> 209.58s]  wanted. Speaking of Bloordow, there's a lot of new people here that do not know who Bloordow is.
[211.21s -> 216.71s]  Let's go ahead and make a very, very quick shout out to Bloordow. Bloordow is the person
[216.71s -> 224.30s]  responsible for the J, the way that it looks, its whole design. All the channel branding that you
[224.30s -> 230.55s]  see is from Bloordow. All the music that you've heard, at least on regular streams like this,
[230.55s -> 235.91s]  sometimes it's not Bloordow. But for the most part, the little tracks you hear are Bloordow.
[238.70s -> 251.42s]  I want to make sure that we send some support his way. Let me get you some links here. This is his
[251.42s -> 257.11s]  band camp. Make sure we get that in the exclamation point if we can for exclamation point Bloordow.
[257.83s -> 270.98s]  And he also has one of those coffee, co-fi, whatever it is. He's absolutely incredibly
[270.98s -> 279.13s]  talented. Deserves to be supported for sure. It's coffee, right? Well, I don't know, co-fi.
[279.13s -> 290.28s]  What am I supposed to say? I don't know. Is it SoundCloud 2? Yeah. You're gonna hear today
[291.00s -> 298.71s]  another like three or four tracks and there's more badges going up and me and Bloordow were
[298.71s -> 305.26s]  talking and we think we might be doing potentially seasonal BRB screens. Seasonal intro screens
[306.26s -> 312.89s]  that have different music and different animations and not just this one. Why not, right? It should
[312.89s -> 319.29s]  be fun. Seasonal BRB. Yeah. Stuff for holidays maybe. I don't know. Just that would be fun.
[319.93s -> 330.57s]  This is a new season. It's crazy that it took me this long. All right. It took me so long
[330.57s -> 336.89s]  to do any of this stuff. We're like 11 years into me being on YouTube and Twitch and stuff.
[338.26s -> 354.81s]  Like it's what the hell? Why has it taken me this long? Lazy. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe a little.
[355.45s -> 365.90s]  If it isn't broke, don't fix it. Did I say that wrong? If it ain't, if it's not broke,
[365.90s -> 371.05s]  if it isn't broken, how did I, what did I say? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[372.68s -> 382.98s]  What? Well, how do you say that? Okay. No, I got it right. Yeah. I said it right. I got it. I got it.
[382.98s -> 387.88s]  All right. Let's, uh, we're gonna play gas station simulator today. Hope everyone had a good week.
[389.27s -> 398.30s]  We will be live today and probably Wednesday. So we'll do that. Got some stuff to do. Gas
[398.30s -> 403.35s]  station simulator. I'm looking forward to it. How are you? I'm doing okay. I'm doing all right.
[403.35s -> 414.10s]  You know, I'm doing all right. I'm doing good. I'm doing all right. If it fixed, broke it.
[416.55s -> 423.40s]  He's so high already. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not going to. Okay. It's time for boring games.
[423.40s -> 432.23s]  Boring games are back. Pog. What do you, what? This is a boring game. I thought everybody wants
[432.23s -> 436.23s]  me to play this. Everybody's been, so many people have wanted me to play this game.
[438.25s -> 449.59s]  That's not a boring game. How's the boring game? You're stalling. I have, no, I'm not stalling.
[449.59s -> 458.89s]  We just heard new streaming musical content. We heard new streaming musical content. That's not
[458.89s -> 474.98s]  stalling. All right. Let's go. Gas station simulator. Again, support Lordow. A lot of the
[474.98s -> 481.62s]  character and a lot of the, a lot of the vibe of this stream is because of Lordow, right?
[484.73s -> 491.13s]  And he's going to be making more shit. So go support him. All right. Make sure my camera's
[491.13s -> 498.14s]  not on. It's not. All right. Gas station simulator. Let's go. Can you hear it? Cause I can't.
[500.42s -> 510.30s]  There it is. A little loud for me, not for you. I'm not stalling. I'm not, what do I mean stall?
[510.30s -> 520.68s]  How am I stalling? Stop. Okay. So how do we play? I'll badge check. Anybody have the new ones?
[520.68s -> 527.32s]  There's like six or seven new ones. There's more, but I want some of the newer ones that are a little
[527.32s -> 534.50s]  less. There's some that are a little less elaborate that I want to be in that two, three, four, five,
[534.50s -> 539.22s]  six month period. Right. But I don't think I can move them around. I think I actually have to like
[539.22s -> 544.81s]  delete them and re-upload them. So I have to do that. I'll do that another time, but there should
[544.81s -> 553.08s]  be some new ones there. All right. Gas station simulator. It may take a while for what? To load
[553.08s -> 574.42s]  the game. There's a GTA screen. Gas station simulator. Have you updated windows? I have
[574.42s -> 583.77s]  not updated windows in like probably like a year. I'm just kidding. Am I driving? It's a cut scene.
[584.98s -> 599.59s]  Loud cut scene. Be careful. Be aware. Loud cut scene. Is there no mirror? Oh wait. No, there is.
[599.59s -> 623.91s]  I was going to say, where is it? For sale. Am I going to get the car stuck? Congratulations.
[623.91s -> 635.78s]  You're now the owner of Dust Bowl gas station. Okay. 12 hours later. I gotta turn on like V-Sync,
[635.78s -> 647.67s]  I think. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. I got V-Sync has to turn on. Where is it? I'm seeing a lot of
[647.67s -> 660.71s]  screen tearing. Where is it? Is it here? Display. Lock FPS. V-Sync on. We can lock FPS. Yeah.
[665.30s -> 669.98s]  We still getting screen tearing? That's much better. Okay. Better, better, better, better,
[670.70s -> 680.20s]  60 FPS. Yeah. Whatever. Change the FOV. I don't think you can. I think it's fine the way it is.
[680.20s -> 693.19s]  This is going to come way down. Like three maybe. Can somebody explain this to me? I know there's a
[693.19s -> 696.63s]  really simple explanation and people are going to be like, dude, this is why and you never knew that
[696.63s -> 704.38s]  you're an idiot. That's fine. Why does it seem like every single game I've ever played? Like to get
[704.38s -> 712.31s]  the mouse to actually work, it's got to be way down here. Like shouldn't this bar be way smaller?
[712.31s -> 718.47s]  I feel like I would... there's no... everybody always puts it like down here, like one centimeter
[718.47s -> 725.22s]  on the bar. Why does that keep happening? Is it because of just different mouse DPI's? Like DPI's
[725.22s -> 734.79s]  like just so high? Because look, ready? So that's at 0.3 and I... that like feels pretty good. Maybe
[734.79s -> 743.77s]  0.4. That's all the way down to the left of the bar. Dude, you're an idiot. That's fine. Let's do
[743.77s -> 751.42s]  0.5. All right. I gotta get out there. Gas station. I use high sensitivity. I usually like to keep it
[751.42s -> 756.15s]  high. It kind of makes my head hurt a little bit. All right. What we got? Figure out how to enter
[756.15s -> 760.39s]  the gas station. Hint while holding something. Throw it right mouse bumper into the trash to get
[760.39s -> 770.73s]  a score. What? Throw it into the trash can. Is there a trash can? Did you tweet? I didn't...
[770.73s -> 777.91s]  look at me. I'm not even fucking streaming. I didn't tweet. You're right. Let me take care of
[777.91s -> 795.59s]  that. Stalling? Gas station simulator. Just to the point. We're not going to add any flare or
[795.59s -> 812.50s]  anything. There it is. Okay. A colonoscopy tomorrow? It's... what have... retry? What?
[812.50s -> 830.34s]  That didn't go through? Why? How did my... the tweet didn't go through. Why not? And why does this
[830.34s -> 835.77s]  happen? Do you hear this? Did you hear that? Somebody had to have heard that. Why does my
[835.77s -> 842.58s]  volume just go to 100 randomly when I type? Does that happen to you guys? What the fuck does that
[842.58s -> 856.57s]  do that for? I didn't know. I'm not hacked. That happens all the time. Just will go to a thousand
[856.65s -> 869.40s]  percent volume. Okay. Gas station simulator. Tweet. Your tweet was sent. Okay. I don't understand why.
[869.40s -> 876.90s]  Dude, you gotta fucking freeze your credit score. Oh shit. Yeah, I... guys, my tweet didn't go
[876.90s -> 882.38s]  through. I gotta freeze my credit scores. I'll be back. I'll see you like next week or something.
[882.38s -> 892.95s]  Throw into the trash? Is there a percentage for throwing? Okay. Well, I can throw things.
[892.95s -> 907.80s]  Where's the trash? Are you serious? Holy shit. Oh, right here. There it is. Yeah, I got the high
[907.80s -> 916.39s]  score. This is some Olympian shit right here. All right. Well, it's kind of hard to do.
[916.39s -> 927.94s]  Figure how to enter the gas station. Okay. Give me a break. What the fuck? Okay. Okay. Let's go.
[927.94s -> 936.22s]  Do I get money for doing this or just points or something? Last score. Longest score distance.
[936.22s -> 951.14s]  Why is that a thing? Do I have to empty the dumpster? How am I supposed to do this?
[951.14s -> 963.00s]  This is not a gas station. This is a disaster. It's gonna take like $500,000 to repair all this
[963.00s -> 986.01s]  and redo everything. Yeah. Is that even about my house? Yeah. What is that? A sprint?
[986.01s -> 1005.06s]  Was this like alien spaceship over here? What is that? Oh, this is a sign. Oh boy. Oh boy.
[1005.70s -> 1019.77s]  That was bad. I thought that was like a weird like tripod alien monster thing. Okay. What we got?
[1019.77s -> 1025.51s]  More trash. Pass completed. Okay. All the high voltage cable and find a way to turn on the
[1025.51s -> 1033.98s]  electricity. I mean shouldn't I do something about this? This is bad. Can I repair this or redo this?
[1033.98s -> 1054.87s]  Oh, the high voltage cable. Okay. Caution. High voltage cable? Where's there a high voltage cable?
[1054.87s -> 1066.86s]  In here? Has it been back there? Read that clock. There's no minute hand guys. I can't read it.
[1066.86s -> 1073.69s]  I was about to say holy shit. Why can't I do this? All right. Where's the high voltage cable?
[1082.94s -> 1097.85s]  Buy fuel. Oh fuck. Okay. Hold on. What's out here? I thought it was inside the house. That's why I
[1097.85s -> 1109.72s]  didn't look at the... I thought it was inside the house. Okay. What we got? Power back on.
[1110.68s -> 1118.42s]  Bro, you've been streaming for four hours. I have not. Are you legitimately high today? No.
[1119.14s -> 1131.75s]  Pick up the phone at the booth in the front of the station. No. I don't like coincide every time I
[1131.75s -> 1143.06s]  turn on a stream with me being like high on marijuana cigarettes. Okay. All right. Who is it?
[1145.27s -> 1151.59s]  Congratulations on your purchase and investment, little nephew. It has been a while since you've
[1151.59s -> 1159.18s]  heard my voice now, hasn't it? I guess, yeah. Yes. I'm a busy person, but luck would have it. But
[1159.18s -> 1165.90s]  the land you've purchased once belonged to my father. Since you are not only a potential
[1165.90s -> 1171.90s]  business partner, but family no less, I'll do my best to help you. Hey, thank you. I will send
[1171.90s -> 1177.74s]  your emails on a regular basis, providing you with information on how to handle each part
[1177.74s -> 1184.62s]  of the business. Do make sure to pay attention. Well, I always feel so bad about this kind of
[1184.62s -> 1190.46s]  stuff. Okay. It was pleasant speaking to you again. Okay. Let's be maybe potentially relatable Andy
[1190.46s -> 1198.38s]  here. So how many times you guys opened up your email that you haven't like opened in like months
[1198.38s -> 1203.26s]  and like an aunt or an uncle has like sent you three emails and it's just like, oh fuck, I don't
[1203.26s -> 1209.74s]  communicate this way at all. I don't want to, I'm not trying to like avoid anybody or anything. I
[1209.74s -> 1216.92s]  just don't communicate like through email and I always like feel so terrible. I don't like
[1216.92s -> 1235.78s]  communicate at all. I'm serious. I read the email on the computer. Okay. How do we turn the gas
[1235.78s -> 1244.74s]  station on? All right. Gas station mail. Howdy. Greetings and salutations. The dialect never really
[1244.74s -> 1249.22s]  was my forte. Regardless, I've just heard you've made a solid investment. Though I pity the fact
[1249.22s -> 1253.96s]  that you had to sell your car for it. You could have always asked me for a loan. I'll pitch in
[1253.96s -> 1258.20s]  with a few tips and tricks. My emails will come periodically. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You need to get
[1258.20s -> 1262.12s]  this station up and running. Who knows how badly it got damaged all those years ago. Don't forget
[1262.12s -> 1267.10s]  to keep generating profit, refurbish a fuel dispenser first. Oh, and don't worry about the
[1267.10s -> 1272.46s]  money for this part. We're a family after all. And family keeps an eye on each other's backs. And
[1272.46s -> 1278.38s]  why am I doing like a sports center routine? And family keeps an eye on each other's backs. I'm here
[1278.38s -> 1283.98s]  to let a helping hand and make a man like me puts money with my mouth is as they say. I feel like
[1283.98s -> 1289.86s]  I'm reading about like the last NFL game, like baseball game or something. Market player already
[1289.86s -> 1300.23s]  played this game. Yeah. Okay. And he's like the god of the internet. That's what do you want me
[1300.23s -> 1314.70s]  to say? Like, that's literally like god of online entertainment. Who doesn't like like market player?
[1316.92s -> 1323.90s]  Right. You know, I watched a jacksepticeye video the other day and I was like, this is like,
[1325.27s -> 1337.06s]  this is a good dude. Like I like like this guy. Different person. Well, I'm just saying like
[1337.06s -> 1352.71s]  another YouTuber, you resuded. Well, okay, look, if I had a choice, right, of like who I wanted,
[1353.93s -> 1359.13s]  like if I had like kids, right, and they grew up a little bit, and I have like friends or whatever.
[1359.77s -> 1363.37s]  Well, I do have friends, but you know, forget what I'm saying. I would want them to watch
[1363.37s -> 1381.26s]  with YouTubers like that. That's whatever. Okay, question mark. I didn't bring them up. You did.
[1386.22s -> 1390.62s]  Why is everybody acting like I just brought up these the YouTubers out of nowhere?
[1391.75s -> 1396.71s]  You know, guys, let me tell you something. I watched market player yesterday and boy was he
[1397.51s -> 1405.72s]  he was great. No, I was react. Oh, hold on. But I mean, I like those guys. I think they're
[1406.28s -> 1411.08s]  they've got good channels. What? What? I can't talk. I'm not allowed to talk about somebody
[1412.10s -> 1426.01s]  in like a positive way. I don't have any gas. Oh, shit. How am I supposed to Okay, wait, wait,
[1426.01s -> 1433.85s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, find a way to refuel Rudy. Search around for an old Jerry can. Okay,
[1433.85s -> 1449.94s]  I need to find an old can. This dude runs a gas station and is out of gas. Okay, while holding
[1449.94s -> 1454.81s]  the Jerry can click left mouse button on the distributor to replenish it. If it's full,
[1454.81s -> 1462.47s]  click left mouse button on the excavator's fuel cap or fuel it. Okay, so I can equip it. Ooh,
[1462.47s -> 1474.31s]  this is empty. You have new mail and that's going to go to there's going to be an X next to new mail
[1474.31s -> 1490.25s]  up to like 12,000. Okay, place and we get it. Oh, shit, I got it. All right. All right. Now,
[1490.25s -> 1497.42s]  I'm going to refuel Rudy. Why does this game exist? I think it's kind of cool.
[1501.11s -> 1510.49s]  Okay, this is full up. Alright, so now return to removing the sand piles. Alright, sand piles.
[1513.11s -> 1525.22s]  Remove sand piles. F to interact. Fuck, don't do that. Why is it saying F to interact?
[1525.86s -> 1538.92s]  Okay, hold to break turbo. Okay, please. I have to remove the sand. How do I do that?
[1548.38s -> 1556.34s]  I didn't do it. When the exhaust turns red, hold right mouse button to cool the engine
[1556.34s -> 1571.72s]  overheating locks turbo. How do I do the turbo? No idea. Don't flip it over. Spacebar break.
[1572.28s -> 1582.04s]  What about T? Okay, left mouse button is pick up and drop sand. Okay, so it's left mouse button.
[1582.04s -> 1599.88s]  Okay, so get right here. I got it. Where am I supposed to put this? Open the gas station
[1599.88s -> 1608.66s]  for customers. This thing this thing's pretty much on fire inside. What? I wouldn't want to
[1608.66s -> 1630.87s]  open. This is a hazard. I dump it. How do I dump this? Oh, fucking whatever. Am I in trouble?
[1639.54s -> 1654.10s]  Okay, what the lights on? Alright, gas stations turn it on. Flip the switch. Let's go. You can
[1654.10s -> 1658.50s]  open and close the gas station at any time. Use the downtime to organize the gas station or do
[1658.50s -> 1663.46s]  other activities that you can find. Right next to the lever, there is a button that restarts traffic.
[1664.26s -> 1689.26s]  What? We're open for business. My entrepreneurial ship begins today. Oh shit, a customer. Please
[1689.26s -> 1697.74s]  stop. Okay, refill your fuel supplies using the PC. What? Oh shit, there's a customer. Where's my PC?
[1697.74s -> 1707.67s]  It's a mess in here. Delivery. I need fuel. How much? How much was it? Just two cents? Your order
[1707.67s -> 1717.50s]  is less than 100 units. Alright, I need 100 units order. I need gas first. Hello. Welcome.
[1721.64s -> 1737.82s]  Is there gas in here? Okay. I don't have any gas.
[1750.62s -> 1763.46s]  This is like the Luigi driving by in Mario Kart phase. Holy shit, man. I'm sorry. Oh, here's the
[1763.46s -> 1771.88s]  delivery. Don't come in. Wait, I want you to come in. This is the delivery truck? Why is this
[1771.88s -> 1778.23s]  a hearse? Is it what it looks like? It looks like the Oscar Mayer hot dog car. This is what
[1778.23s -> 1791.21s]  that car looks like. That's crazy. Alright, yeah, back it up. It's the wiener mobile.
[1792.25s -> 1800.86s]  You're literally insane. I hope you know that. Yeah, I mean, I guess you're right. Alright,
[1800.86s -> 1819.35s]  hook it up. Need help? Oh shit, nice. Alright, you can't hit anybody. Just in case you were
[1819.35s -> 1828.15s]  wondering. Because I wasn't. Alright, is it in? Wait, am I putting it back in his car?
[1831.62s -> 1846.36s]  Oh shit, I think I put it back in his car. How do I get it? Do I have it? Is there gas in there?
[1847.00s -> 1855.91s]  Wait, there's a customer. Do I have fuel? I don't have any fucking fuel. What? Hey,
[1855.91s -> 1862.90s]  you know, I'm not gonna pay for it if you take it. Get back here. Get back. I'm gonna put my
[1862.90s -> 1877.80s]  mouth on it. What happened to my gas? Officer, arrest that man. I have gas. It said no fuel.
[1886.90s -> 1900.90s]  You have a hundred. I just walked three times. The gas. The person at the pump right now is like,
[1900.90s -> 1907.05s]  I just watched this guy walk around his house three times. This guy's a fucking crack. Oh,
[1907.13s -> 1918.50s]  okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So what? That's how much gas they want? Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[1920.31s -> 1932.39s]  You're welcome. Open tools. I have a backpack. Okay. Alright, goodbye. Who's coming up next?
[1933.03s -> 1944.65s]  How much gas do I have? I'm like 85. I need more gas. Sweep the cars with the broom. Is there a
[1944.65s -> 1961.02s]  broom? Where? Where's this broom you're talking about? Where's the broom? Play the arcade game.
[1961.02s -> 1968.66s]  Yeah, but this... Wait, I gotta close the gas station. No. Alright, I'm going. Test your skills
[1968.66s -> 1975.64s]  in the arcade. You unlock it later. Okay. Well, I don't have it then. I don't have it right now.
[1983.16s -> 1996.78s]  What is this? Race car. Get through all the checkpoints in the outlined order.
[1997.34s -> 2020.31s]  Finish the race before 1 15 to get 20 bucks. Oh shit. Alright, I got it. Well, I mean, how
[2020.31s -> 2042.65s]  was it close to know where the road went? I can still do it. Okay. Why did that happen? First F
[2042.65s -> 2050.81s]  to quit the car. Well, I don't think it was a minute and 15. I don't think I'm going to get a
[2050.81s -> 2073.90s]  minute 15. This is for $20. This is just a mini golf course. Oh my god. I thought this
[2073.90s -> 2084.86s]  said save the customer at the fuel dispenser. What happened? What did he do? The car can only
[2084.86s -> 2097.05s]  be refueled after the customer has left the car. Okay. Hello. Grab the injector when client is
[2097.05s -> 2101.69s]  waiting. Fuel cap will be outlined. Fuel the car by interacting with the cap. Boost the speed. Hit
[2101.69s -> 2123.03s]  the mark to get paid a tip. Thank you. Where's the broom? Okay. I have 72 liters, which that
[2123.03s -> 2129.37s]  should last me a little while. 320 bucks. What else can I do? Buy a trash bag and equip it.
[2132.42s -> 2141.54s]  Oh, here we go. Trash bag free. You can buy tools. Okay. Trash with a trash bag. You can pick up
[2141.54s -> 2147.54s]  small garbage and replace garbage bags and trash cans. Bigger garbage like junk or filled trash
[2147.54s -> 2153.58s]  bags must be put in containers outside. You need to order garbage collection using a PC.
[2154.22s -> 2159.62s]  If you left trash cans for a long time, they'll start to stink and discourage customers.
[2159.62s -> 2176.47s]  Why would I have opened this place yet? Okay. So collect small trash. Okay. Then what do I just
[2176.47s -> 2199.58s]  dump it? Okay. Empty the trash cans inside the station with your trash bags. Okay. Dispose of
[2199.58s -> 2212.79s]  filled trash bags and old furniture. All right. I like this. This is hitting all the notes for me
[2212.79s -> 2232.87s]  right here. All right. There's a bunch of trash. Hold on. Yeah. I know it's making bags. I'm going
[2232.87s -> 2252.22s]  to run around and pick them all up later. What do you have for a coaster? It's Pac-Man coasters.
[2252.22s -> 2260.90s]  Just Pac-Man. You know, nothing's crazy. You can't throw away the grandfather clock. That'd be weird.
[2260.90s -> 2272.70s]  All right. Let me see. Dispose of filled trash bags. You got it. Oh, shit. All right. I got to
[2272.70s -> 2277.46s]  get good at this. It's not 20%. What is it from this door? What is it from here to here?
[2278.10s -> 2286.34s]  If I hold my cursor like right there. No, it's probably like 40%. A little bit higher. Like
[2286.34s -> 2304.63s]  right here. Yep. Okay. I think I got it down. God damn it. There's so much junk everywhere.
[2304.63s -> 2335.99s]  There's a customer. Oh, it's a cop. All right. You got it. Thank you. Do I close the gas station?
[2340.10s -> 2358.26s]  I have to clean up. Anarchy. Anarchy. Anarchy. Anarchy. No. No. Anarchy. Okay.
[2359.29s -> 2370.10s]  I'm trying to run my business here. Everybody in jazz is saying Anarchy. Anarchy. Anarchy. Anarchy.
[2375.96s -> 2390.82s]  Oh, that's funny. Any more trash? How much can fit in one dumpster?
[2390.82s -> 2408.68s]  Guess we'll find out. Because this is still going in, right? Yeah. There's so much trash. Although
[2408.68s -> 2411.88s]  I'm probably going to be able to clean this up though. I'm looking forward to this. This is
[2411.88s -> 2427.43s]  going to be awesome. God damn it. It's with the calming music. Yeah, it is kind of just calming,
[2427.43s -> 2440.39s]  isn't it? Should I call for the service to come pick this up? Or should I? Did I pay for one
[2440.39s -> 2447.35s]  dumpster when I need four dumpsters worth of space? But just pile everything on top up to here with
[2447.35s -> 2462.42s]  one dumpster and pay one dumpster price. Customer. Oh, hello, sir. Madam. How are you? Hold on. Let
[2462.42s -> 2469.96s]  me just hold on. You had a little stain on your window there. Welcome. I got the best gas prices
[2469.96s -> 2480.73s]  in the entire valley. You just stay right there. Perfect every time. Remember, tell your friends.
[2480.73s -> 2488.46s]  I really appreciate a potential at least four star on Yelp if you could. We have zero reviews,
[2488.46s -> 2494.14s]  even on Google, which is unheard of. Yup. Thank you. Have a wonderful evening. Tell your friends.
[2494.94s -> 2512.17s]  Thank you. Okay. Yeah. And none of that bullshit where on Google you give me a five,
[2512.17s -> 2528.50s]  but on your Yelp account you give me like a three eight. None of that bullshit. Google's always
[2528.50s -> 2536.38s]  higher. You gotta be careful. You have to take the average. If you look up like a restaurant,
[2536.38s -> 2541.74s]  like, oh, what's this place? This place looks kind of good. Maybe I'll try here maybe. How's this one?
[2541.74s -> 2546.54s]  It's got like a four eight on Google. And on Yelp, that same place has like a three five.
[2546.54s -> 2561.35s]  It's like, what is, what's going on here? Who recommends gas stations? What's wrong with
[2561.35s -> 2566.25s]  recommending a gas station? What if it's like the people there are friendly and, oh,
[2566.73s -> 2579.13s]  uh, hello. I'm so glad you made it to my station. What a car. It's 2016. Oh, love it. Love it. Love
[2579.13s -> 2584.41s]  the paint job too. Is it? That's like a ocean teal. Absolutely fantastic. These are off-road
[2584.41s -> 2591.67s]  tires too. Very, very cool. You come out here often? Yeah. Yeah. Nice. I'm just on vacation
[2591.67s -> 2598.09s]  with the family. That's really cool. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. So just fill you up. And if
[2598.09s -> 2605.18s]  you, I got snacks too, if you need anything. It didn't need very much. Uh, yeah. I gave you
[2605.18s -> 2609.34s]  a pretty decent review of your car. I thought it was a nice car. I would get, I would probably
[2609.34s -> 2615.18s]  give your car, I would say probably like a 4.5. That's what I would give your car. Uh, so if
[2615.18s -> 2620.46s]  whatever you want to give me, um, I would, I gave you a four five on your, I'd like your teal.
[2620.46s -> 2641.35s]  Thanks for coming again. Don't talk to the customers. Why not? Why are you such a serial
[2641.35s -> 2660.74s]  killer? Um, I got, I have to get this taken. There's too much here. You're a real charlatan.
[2660.74s -> 2671.67s]  No, I have, I have fair gas at fair prices. Okay. I'm going to buy a broom. This place is
[2671.67s -> 2683.86s]  cleaning up a little bit. Okay. So what is it? How sweep the floor? Oh, this cleaning
[2684.58s -> 2691.58s]  in the top of corner, you can see the floor is dirty status. Swipe the footprints, paint stains
[2691.58s -> 2695.10s]  and other, other dirt from the floor. If you do not take care of the cleanliness customers will
[2695.18s -> 2706.41s]  stop shopping. What do you mean shopping? This thing sucks. This doesn't do anything. Oh my
[2706.41s -> 2718.01s]  God. It's going to take forever. All right. Is there any, hold on. You actually have to sweep
[2718.01s -> 2735.46s]  with it. You have to push it. There we go. I need more. Don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I'll get back on
[2735.46s -> 2739.46s]  that in just a second. Fill that order for the customer back there. Yeah. We want to take care
[2739.46s -> 2744.39s]  of our, we want to take care of our people there. Hey, how are you? Good to see you. Okay.
[2744.39s -> 2747.27s]  Got to fill you up here. Sorry. We got like, got some customers, but pretty busy.
[2749.05s -> 2760.84s]  What do you need? Just regular unleaded. You've got it. 29.75. Have a great day. Have a wonderful
[2760.84s -> 2781.69s]  day. Have a good day. Have a one. Have a good day. Have an awesome day. You're a psycho. Whatever.
[2782.33s -> 2815.72s]  It took you this long to figure that out. Okay. Why won't this clean? Shit. Don't I have two of
[2815.72s -> 2831.02s]  these? Who's the other one? Oh, Monka W. We should have seen it earlier. Whatever. Can you please do
[2831.02s -> 2837.99s]  the, so you married into it routine again? No. Oh shit. You know what? Actually that makes sense
[2837.99s -> 2847.94s]  today. That makes sense today. You live in that house, not back? Well, yes. We have, we lived in
[2847.94s -> 2880.09s]  Temple, Texas for many years. Can I broom? This is powerful. Holy shit. What? How are you going to
[2880.09s -> 2898.92s]  leave? Wait, hold on. Hold on. I'll get it back. Holy shit. I had to rotate your tires. Okay.
[2898.92s -> 2922.73s]  Where's gas do you need? Thank you. We'll see you soon. All right. See you later. Have fun.
[2922.73s -> 2961.83s]  Thanks for coming. Holy shit. Hold on. Wait. Oh my God. The broom is very powerful. 3.5 on Yelp.
[2961.83s -> 2976.58s]  Yeah. That's not going to soft lock me, right? Hold on. It might actually soft lock the game.
[2976.58s -> 2984.46s]  Dude. Oh, oh, okay. It's going to take a little, it's going to take a little bit of time,
[2984.46s -> 2990.65s]  but I have, I have an experiment I would like to try. I want to pile just cars up on the road here
[2990.65s -> 2995.45s]  in front. Have like a stack of like 30 of them. I wonder if it's, if we're not going to be able to
[2995.45s -> 3018.47s]  get any more spawns. Not yet though. Not yet. Would it go back? Oh shit. Why does this stream
[3018.47s -> 3026.65s]  look awful? It does? What do you mean? I'm very curious what you mean by that. Looks. No, no, no.
[3026.65s -> 3034.46s]  Oh, I ran out of gas. Oh shit. Here comes the Yelp review. I can't believe a gas station ran
[3034.46s -> 3038.78s]  out of gas. How does that make any sense? It's the only gas station within 30 miles.
[3039.50s -> 3054.49s]  Shit. I need to order more gas. I need a gas. How much the order has been reduced to match
[3054.49s -> 3066.14s]  the available capacity. How much money do I have? All right. I need it. I have like no money left.
[3066.14s -> 3076.54s]  All right. Back with what I was doing. Very important. I know how to use the broom. Leave
[3076.54s -> 3086.02s]  me alone. Where's the car? I believe it despawned. Yeah, the car despawned. Well, I don't have any
[3086.02s -> 3096.46s]  gas so I have to turn people away. There's no gas in this gas station. Sorry. No gas. Wait,
[3096.46s -> 3112.26s]  let's do this. Turn off. This is the guy with the, the owner of the gas station is sitting out with
[3112.26s -> 3121.43s]  a broom in front of the entrance swinging it around like an orc sword. What is he doing?
[3121.43s -> 3131.80s]  We're not going to that gas station. You know what, by the way, I, I would open up Yelp and I would
[3131.80s -> 3138.98s]  just say that this like, this is a kind of a dangerous place. I would give it a one and then
[3139.62s -> 3146.71s]  reply from the business owner. I'm very sorry that you feel that that happened that way.
[3147.27s -> 3152.63s]  Please, if there's anything I could do about it, send an email to this email that I don't check.
[3152.63s -> 3158.90s]  That's probably a dead email that I haven't opened in years. We value your feedback. Thank you for
[3158.90s -> 3171.88s]  shopping at the Germa gas station. I was about to throw this guy. Hi, David. I would really like to
[3171.88s -> 3191.45s]  get this situated right away. Please hit me up at my email. All right. Connected. I felt like my
[3191.45s -> 3210.14s]  life was in danger. Four out of five. All right, let's turn it. Thanks a lot. I have a bunch of
[3210.14s -> 3216.30s]  email. I don't read guys. Do you understand? I don't like read emails. I don't answer phone calls.
[3216.30s -> 3223.80s]  I, I'm never, I don't, I w okay. When I'm not streaming on this website right now, I don't exist.
[3223.80s -> 3237.94s]  I completely disconnect. I do. I look, we have gas. Yeah, I disappear. How much gas are you giving
[3237.94s -> 3262.68s]  me? Come on, hurry up. Oh, I stopped it. Okay. You check your pager, right? No. What about your mom?
[3262.68s -> 3270.78s]  Of course I talk to my mom. I disconnect from like the internet. I got, I try to stay, I try to keep
[3270.78s -> 3281.83s]  my brain away from the internet. I live on the internet. You know what I mean? But I'll tell you,
[3281.83s -> 3287.91s]  you want some real, no more joking around. Let's like be honest about something. You got to give
[3287.91s -> 3297.00s]  yourself some time. Seriously. Give yourself a little time, at least a day or two to just not
[3297.00s -> 3305.43s]  just disconnect from it. It's actually, it's very, very much healthy for you. Check this shit out.
[3305.43s -> 3318.10s]  I'm going to hit the fucking tip of that goddamn thing right there. Shut up. You're a serial killer.
[3318.66s -> 3341.22s]  Why is it still telling me that this is delivery? How much gas would you like?
[3344.18s -> 3374.94s]  You're welcome. You have to do the sob voice and say gas. I don't, I don't have to do that.
[3379.70s -> 3386.68s]  Please do the coin toss scene. Clean, do the, I'm not going to, no, I've done it so many times.
[3386.68s -> 3391.30s]  You could just go back and watch like the five times I've done it in the last year.
[3391.86s -> 3398.73s]  Okay. What about, okay. Mail. Fine. Sweeping. Yeah. Fueling. Ordering. I know how to do this.
[3398.73s -> 3411.91s]  Okay. 60 seconds of traffic to untangle itself in some, okay. So this is just email. He's just
[3411.91s -> 3421.37s]  email tutorials. I already know all of this, but I can, I can sell alcohol. There's a paint roller.
[3421.37s -> 3430.46s]  All right. I need money. I need to, wait, wait, wait. Let me clean up.
[3430.46s -> 3436.84s]  I need, how do I get the trash to be taken? There's still this dumpster back here. Full.
[3436.84s -> 3447.08s]  How do I get somebody, how does somebody take it? How does somebody dumpster? Yeah, I know. I said
[3447.08s -> 3458.23s]  dumpster. Whatever. Dumpster. Dumpster. Dumpster. Museum. Museum. Um, how do I get somebody to take
[3458.23s -> 3483.70s]  the trash? Hi. Gas. Okay. Super. Thank you. You'll remember that, right? And I think you're going to
[3483.70s -> 3491.37s]  get a false star. You'll go from a three to a four. And even if they don't review, they will
[3491.37s -> 3496.25s]  remember this weird, like guy that did the weird voice and they'll come back because they'll remember
[3496.25s -> 3512.81s]  it. It's going to be in their brain. Okay. How do I get somebody to take this? You know what I'm
[3512.81s -> 3517.35s]  saying? Like how does it, it said, oh, we have somebody pick up the trash. Did I not unlock it
[3517.35s -> 3531.94s]  yet? I don't see it on the PC anywhere. Locked. Locked. Gas station. Level one. More info. I have
[3531.94s -> 3546.68s]  to finish the sweep tutorial. Okay. Okay. Am I tracking this in here? You take your shoes off
[3546.68s -> 3569.90s]  at the door. You know what I mean? I think I have to move this. Wait, no, no. No, you don't have to
[3569.90s -> 3576.18s]  take your shoes off at the door to come into the gas station to buy a Coke. Can you imagine?
[3579.93s -> 3583.61s]  No shoes in the ga- yeah. Oh, excuse me. I just had these floors cleaned.
[3585.45s -> 3593.96s]  You gotta leave your shoes at the door. There we go. Okay. Garbage collection. How much is it?
[3595.34s -> 3605.10s]  What's that called? Dennis. Dennis will appear on station occasionally and paint graffiti on the
[3605.10s -> 3611.19s]  walls. Stop him by throwing items at him to scare him off. New events will appear during the course
[3611.19s -> 3616.41s]  of the game. You can turn them off in the options so they don't happen again. What? I'm about to
[3616.41s -> 3635.88s]  throw like a table at this kid? Get out of here! You little bastard! I just threw a table at him.
[3640.62s -> 3648.60s]  Okay. I don't have any more stuff to throw at him. Throw back a trash at him. Where'd he go?
[3650.95s -> 3659.64s]  Officer! Officer! There's a kid that's a disturbance. Oh yeah, we actually have
[3659.64s -> 3664.52s]  reports of a grown man throwing furniture at a child. Trying to hit the child in the head with
[3664.52s -> 3671.58s]  a piece of furniture. Well, you see, he was putting graffiti on my walls and I had to scare him off.
[3672.14s -> 3696.47s]  Oh, you want some gas while you're here? Thanks. And don't forget the motto with two shakes.
[3696.47s -> 3705.78s]  Shake, shake. We have another custom. Shake, shake. Shake, shake. What is that? Shake, shake.
[3705.78s -> 3712.39s]  Shake, shake. Mischief makers for the Nintendo 64. Shake, shake. Yeah, that's mischief makers.
[3713.03s -> 3729.72s]  The N64. That's the one. That game was good too if I remember. Did it take the trash? Hold on. Wait.
[3729.72s -> 3740.01s]  It's coming back. Help me, Marina! Did I get it right? Did I get that right? I think I did.
[3740.65s -> 3761.32s]  I pulled it out somehow. Did I get it? It's like opening cutscene. What are you talking about? I'm
[3761.32s -> 3771.90s]  talking about mischief makers for the Nintendo 64. What are you talking about? Minus two. That
[3771.90s -> 3787.70s]  wasn't a good impression. Shake, shake. Yes, it was. How is that not a good impression?
[3788.26s -> 3814.28s]  Much more important. Hold on. No, where is it? I know it's here. Mischief makers. Intro. Mischief
[3814.28s -> 3834.68s]  makers. I was going to type in mischief makers. Help me. Does anybody have it? This is it. Oh,
[3834.68s -> 3838.76s]  fuck. Yeah, I got it. I did it. I got it perfectly by the way. All the people in the chat that said,
[3838.76s -> 3864.71s]  what am I talking about? Excuse me. Listen to that. Here it comes. Not that one. The song is good too.
[3872.14s -> 3890.04s]  I'm going to take a bow right now. Thanks a lot. Thanks for coming. Thanks for coming.
[3890.04s -> 3907.35s]  It's not Homer. Not everybody is Homer Simpson. No, it's not every single person is Homer Simpson.
[3908.15s -> 3920.20s]  Keep the trash gone. Buy a roller and paint the scribbled walls. Okay, hold on. I got,
[3920.20s -> 3925.42s]  I still have trash. He's throwing, I'm not throwing a tantrum. What are you talking about?
[3926.06s -> 3930.94s]  I'm just messing around. You guys, we just have a lot of fun here. That's it. That's it. You know
[3930.94s -> 3947.32s]  what I mean? Oh, you're 50? No, I mean I'm almost 40, which is kind of terrifying. Weird. When I was
[3947.32s -> 3958.22s]  younger and I was like, in my teens, somebody that was 40 was, okay, it was like the dentist.
[3958.22s -> 3963.99s]  You know what I mean? Does that make sense? It was like, like my, you might not, the dentist was 40,
[3963.99s -> 3972.39s]  right? My teachers were 40 and they were old. It was like, oh, you're much older. You're like
[3972.39s -> 3980.82s]  an older person. You're the dentist. You're the teacher. I will look at people like, oh, this
[3980.82s -> 3985.78s]  person's like in the news or whatever. And they're like 33. And I look at them and I go,
[3985.78s -> 4005.40s]  holy shit, I'm like three or four years older than this person? What? It's weird. You're 40
[4005.40s -> 4014.74s]  and still an E-clown. I'm not 40 yet. I'm not 40 yet. Midlife crisis? No, midlife crisis is when I'm
[4014.74s -> 4030.52s]  like 50. I'm not there yet. I'm not having a midlife crisis. I definitely, okay, here's one
[4030.52s -> 4038.20s]  thing I will say. I definitely feel like I've grown up a lot, like in my brain. I'm pretty,
[4038.20s -> 4048.06s]  I'm certain of it. I have to paint the walls? Oh, I just have it. Once equipped or shift to
[4048.06s -> 4065.61s]  select a color, I can paint whatever I want. Sure. It seems like it really, I'm turning 18 and I don't
[4065.61s -> 4071.42s]  think 40 is that old. No, it's not, but still it's interesting to think about. All right.
[4071.42s -> 4086.81s]  Uh, don't splash paint. What should I, what should I paint it? Um, oh, I really gotta, I hope that
[4086.81s -> 4093.93s]  guy comes back. What happened? What happened? I don't, I don't understand what I'm supposed to
[4093.93s -> 4106.14s]  be doing. Stay in the green. Oh, it's like Stardew Valley fishing. I get it. Okay. I hope that guy
[4106.14s -> 4118.62s]  comes back with that, uh, teal car. What the fuck? Hey, take a look at my, like, like the color.
[4119.26s -> 4124.34s]  Yeah. I love that color too. What did I get? What did I rate your, your car, your color?
[4124.34s -> 4128.58s]  It's like for something. I think I, I mean, I've got the same color. Great minds think alike.
[4129.30s -> 4149.67s]  Move is really strange. Does this cost money? It doesn't look like it does. Oh,
[4159.40s -> 4168.36s]  paint their car. No, that's awful. I'm not going to paint somebody else's car.
[4182.82s -> 4197.91s]  What? What happened? Why is this? Why is it white? I'm not sure that thing really matters.
[4198.47s -> 4207.96s]  Cause it just paints it anyways. What's your thoughts on couscous? It's really good.
[4208.76s -> 4223.69s]  It's, it's really good. I think it's really good. So nice. They named it twice.
[4224.25s -> 4232.41s]  I don't like New York, New York city city. So nice. They named it twice.
[4232.97s -> 4255.54s]  Could the whole thing just be green? That's a boomer joke. I mean, that's not,
[4255.54s -> 4270.71s]  Rob wasn't really trying to make a joke or anything. Oh, fresh paint job right in the front.
[4274.94s -> 4283.69s]  Oh yeah. We're going to do for you. How about, yeah, fill it up. I got plenty. I got plenty of
[4283.69s -> 4298.57s]  fuel. How come nobody needs more than a quarter tank of gas? Give you a shortcut. Oh God. See you
[4298.57s -> 4332.57s]  later. Why can you do that? Find the right tool to break into the car trunk. What is it? Like a
[4332.57s -> 4343.10s]  lockpick? Oh, equip the lockpick and then use it to open the trunk. Press AD to rotate the pin.
[4343.10s -> 4347.46s]  Hold spacebar to try and open the trunk. You can't run out to break the pin. You'll have two attempts.
[4348.41s -> 4354.10s]  If you fail or leave, you'll not be able to try again. Okay. Rotate the pin. Don't break the pin.
[4370.94s -> 4389.00s]  Got it, right? I got it. What? There it is. Dust bowl painting. $13. Nice. What should I do with this?
[4389.56s -> 4410.54s]  I'll sell you this painting for 13 bucks. Where did it go? Where'd it go? Okay. Oh, cool. All right.
[4410.54s -> 4422.17s]  Wait, you. Come here. Awesome. Bye. I'm gonna read my message to Otto. Otto said, thank you.
[4422.81s -> 4433.69s]  He really appreciates it. Oh, shit. Soft drinks? Snacks? Definitely. I want a big soft drink stand.
[4434.33s -> 4451.27s]  Okay. Gels. Okay. Big soft drinks. I can't put this outside. I want to rotate this though.
[4453.50s -> 4479.03s]  Where should this go? Right here? Oh, that's. That looks off center. Shit. It's better. Okay.
[4479.03s -> 4494.63s]  Uh, place. I need products? Okay. And a snack. Small snack tray.
[4496.23s -> 4517.30s]  Shouldn't be blocking the door. I think it's fine. Nice. All right. I got the drinks. It's
[4517.30s -> 4524.78s]  not blocking the door. Look, you can. It is blocking the door. Can I move this? Who wants
[4524.78s -> 4538.20s]  this clock? I don't want it. Just. Where do I put it then? Okay. Well, I can do this though.
[4538.20s -> 4550.31s]  Right. Up against this pillar. I should do it. Yeah, that's fine. All right. Oh, yeah. Okay.
[4550.31s -> 4565.18s]  Buy additional parking space. Parking space? Parking lot. The only serviceable parking lot
[4565.18s -> 4569.34s]  for the time being. It's free. Your uncle paid for it in full. You will need to clean it
[4569.34s -> 4580.98s]  from sand, however. Okay. I have to clean this area of sand. It's a great looking gas station.
[4580.98s -> 4594.09s]  I want that person. No, I'm going to relax. I'm not going to. No, don't let them get to you.
[4594.09s -> 4611.18s]  Ignore them. Ignore them. I need to. How do I dump the sand? You did that joke before. I do that
[4611.18s -> 4626.58s]  joke like once a week. That happens all the time. I want to dump this. How? Pick up, drop sand,
[4626.58s -> 4636.07s]  hold left mouse button. I can't put it down. Don't put it on the road.
[4636.07s -> 4651.62s]  Do you have any thoughts on the CSGO major? No, not really. I don't really watch Counter-Strike.
[4652.26s -> 4676.28s]  What the fuck happened? Oh, shit. I don't know. I don't. I can't. I don't know what's going on up
[4676.28s -> 4685.70s]  there. If this goes for miles. This goes for miles, man. I don't. There must have been something.
[4685.70s -> 4689.46s]  It's a construction like five to 10 miles up. This goes all the way back, man. Don't just stay
[4689.46s -> 4694.94s]  there. Don't get out of the car. There's no reason to. I don't. I don't know. It's crazy.
[4694.94s -> 4719.88s]  It goes so far. Oh, my God. Yeah, I found the problem. There was a little bit of a jam.
[4731.74s -> 4758.46s]  OK, I need to dump the sand. I can't dump the sand. It won't do it. Right. No, right. Right.
[4758.46s -> 4770.36s]  Mouse button is cool off the engine. Left mouse button. It won't do anything. Oh, fuck. I'm out
[4770.36s -> 4798.62s]  of gas. Oh, shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why did I just make that noise? OK. Oh, no, I need that.
[4798.62s -> 4807.80s]  All right. I have a question. If the car is upside down, how do you drive it? We're going
[4807.80s -> 4837.56s]  to find that out. Oh, my God. How? What? What are the odds of that happening? See, this is why
[4837.56s -> 4843.34s]  I don't want to be a dick about this. Excuse me, ma'am, but I'm going to be. This is why when you
[4843.34s -> 4847.90s]  pull up, make sure you know what side your gas tank is on. So I don't have to do this shit.
[4849.30s -> 4873.98s]  Thank you, though. Yep. OK. How much do you want? No, I want it to be flipped over. Oh, fuck. Oh,
[4873.98s -> 4889.03s]  God. OK. Well, how much did you need? Water tank. You got it. Thanks. Come again. Good luck.
[4889.03s -> 4930.78s]  He's starting to turn. Oh, it's another customer. Just keep it. No, there's another traffic jam
[4930.78s -> 4944.36s]  again. Now what? What's the problem now? This guy's just not driving. This guy just crashed
[4944.36s -> 4960.39s]  into the wall. I was the same person. Well, you will not be coming back. You're lucky. No,
[4960.39s -> 4969.67s]  stop trying to come back here. Just leave. Get out of here. No, you have too much like determination
[4969.67s -> 4980.95s]  to get back. Get out of here. I'm launching you all the way over there. I can't. OK, stop. OK,
[4980.95s -> 5003.19s]  he's not moving now. Stand on top of the car and sweep it. Great idea. OK. Hey, welcome. How are
[5003.19s -> 5008.09s]  you? Good to see you. Let me just go ahead and fill you up real quick. But before I do that,
[5008.81s -> 5012.62s]  I just have to give you a little bit of a few safety precautions with your vehicle and make
[5012.62s -> 5020.76s]  sure that everything checks out. You know, check the windshield wiper blade movements. Make sure
[5020.76s -> 5063.30s]  they're not squeaking or anything. Oh, no, no. OK. No, I'm. Why do you have hostages? I don't.
[5064.26s -> 5079.19s]  Have you ever finished the thought in your life? That's a good question for my math teacher.
[5079.19s -> 5094.46s]  It's a great question. That's a great question for anyone that's ever communicated with me.
[5094.46s -> 5112.23s]  I mean, what? Because I would try to explain the math problem and I'd get halfway through and it
[5112.23s -> 5116.31s]  would just I'd be like, I'm not doing it anymore. I can't finish this. I can't finish this thought.
[5116.31s -> 5125.90s]  I can't do it. I think I did. I actually softlock myself. I might have picked the trunk of their
[5126.22s -> 5151.70s]  car. Can you do that? No, you can't actually do that. Oh, my God. Oh, that went very far.
[5152.26s -> 5168.39s]  This is such a mess over here. All right. I have to. OK. Honest to God, you just go.
[5172.15s -> 5188.15s]  How did that happen? Everyone just get out of the way. Holy shit. All right. We got in.
[5197.11s -> 5200.63s]  I'm going to break the game and we're going to have to stop. All right. I'm not going to do that
[5200.63s -> 5211.59s]  anymore. I have to go get a can. I have to fill up this thing and I have to figure out
[5211.59s -> 5234.41s]  how to dump this shit here. I can't dump it. It's bugged. This shit is bugged. No shit. Come here.
[5234.41s -> 5248.09s]  Press T. No, I have to fill this thing up with gas. There's a dumping zone. Is that why I can't do it?
[5248.09s -> 5274.76s]  All right. Come here. I have to dump it in the sand pit. Oh, shit. OK. Fill it up. What was that
[5274.76s -> 5288.60s]  can? Oh, literally in my inventory. I don't have time to deal with it. No, I'm sorry. Go find another
[5288.60s -> 5316.09s]  gas station. I hit you like 15 miles that way. You'll find one. I need to buy more gas. OK,
[5316.09s -> 5322.06s]  actually no more messing around or anything because I'm going to run out of I'm going to
[5322.06s -> 5333.03s]  I'm going to run out of money. All right. I need to dump this shit. Where can I dump it?
[5334.10s -> 5349.69s]  Right here. But this is where the parking spot is. Where's the dumping zone? Near the road entrance.
[5350.33s -> 5374.33s]  Break the game waiting room. Sand disposal. Oh, my God. Here you go. Why can't I just put it over
[5374.33s -> 5381.48s]  to the right? This is a giant sign. Are you think I'm paying attention to the sign over there?
[5388.46s -> 5400.95s]  Fill it up. Now I can buy a parking spot. Game journalist moment. Put it in self only and emote
[5400.95s -> 5420.41s]  only. I'm not going to be talked to like this. I'm not going to talk to like this. If you would like
[5420.41s -> 5428.68s]  to address me, then you can say excuse me, comma, streamer, comma, and then ask a question. If you'd
[5428.68s -> 5448.66s]  like to address me, that's how I will be addressed. Diva. I don't want to be a diva. You know what I
[5448.66s -> 5453.30s]  mean? Like, I really hope it never happens. I don't think it's ever. I hope it doesn't. I really
[5453.30s -> 5463.77s]  don't. I hope not. This one's free. Oh, I just spray painted white spray paint on the sand.
[5463.77s -> 5482.89s]  I didn't make a parking spot. What? OK, answer the call from uncle. OK, I have somebody said
[5482.89s -> 5491.67s]  spray paint. I liked it. That was funny. Hello. I see the business is doing well. I'm calling
[5491.67s -> 5498.71s]  to congratulate you on successfully getting it off the ground. But you can't run a business on
[5498.71s -> 5505.59s]  fuel alone. I've had a few of my people deliver some extra stock for those empty shelves of yours.
[5506.23s -> 5513.53s]  Time to talk money. You now owe me. Well, I'll send you the invoice to your email.
[5514.17s -> 5519.53s]  Don't miss it. I'm sorry, nephew, but there is just no room for charity in this world.
[5520.17s -> 5526.41s]  I hope you'll find it within your finances to repay the debt. Otherwise, we'll be forced to see
[5526.41s -> 5533.61s]  to more persuasive methods of reimbursement. Don't have me wait too long now. You're by.
[5533.61s -> 5549.10s]  Hi. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. This is what do you do? Oh, they're parked in the way.
[5551.50s -> 5570.25s]  Come on in. The trash. Look at all this junk. Soft drinks over here. We got chips. Yeah,
[5570.25s -> 5576.46s]  that's right. I have Pocky. I have Pocky here. That's right. I know. Aren't you? Don't you think
[5576.46s -> 5586.98s]  it's awesome? Use L shift to move the belt and hold left mouse button to move products.
[5587.70s -> 5594.12s]  Move products over scanner and put them into the basket. The belt will get dirty over time
[5594.12s -> 5599.56s]  and slow down. Clean it by holding right mouse button and wiping over the belt. Make no mistakes.
[5603.06s -> 5619.19s]  All right. You got Oreos and orange juice. Another orange juice. A can of Pringles.
[5619.19s -> 5627.38s]  Oops. That went for free. Oops. That's not fair. You don't just get that for free because it fell
[5627.38s -> 5635.08s]  down. Soda. Okay. All right. Are you just putting shit up here like just to fuck with me?
[5639.03s -> 5655.16s]  Well, I need this. Okay. Okay. Your total will be $22. What am I gonna do for you? One can of Coke.
[5656.50s -> 5663.88s]  Eight Skittles. Pringles. I got customers out there. I got customers out there.
[5669.69s -> 5675.59s]  Just take it. Just take it. Just take it. Take it. Take it. What? I thought there was a customer.
[5678.30s -> 5686.90s]  What? What are you doing? What do you mean scammed? He got it for free. He was pissed that he got half
[5686.90s -> 5711.94s]  that shit for free. What are you talking about? You got it for free. I'm moving it. Hey, looking
[5711.94s -> 5720.01s]  for soda? I got plenty of soda. Now what's the problem? There's nobody in this car. Oh, that's
[5720.01s -> 5731.05s]  the person I just saw. It's you. Just... Uh-oh. Here comes the police. All right. What can I do
[5731.05s -> 5746.86s]  for you? Okay. Okay. Yeah. You're gonna bring like all of your trash in here. That's like a
[5746.86s -> 5766.28s]  full trash bag. Thank you. Have a good day. You received a tip from... Oh, I got a tip. Thanks.
[5768.44s -> 5796.20s]  Sweep that guy. No. Oh, shit. Where's the... Where's the cop? What was that? Where's the cop? Okay.
[5796.20s -> 5803.66s]  Here you go. And, um, hold on. Just one minute here. Hold on. Sorry. I have to... I have to go
[5803.66s -> 5835.99s]  to the bathroom. That's it? Not where you left it. No. Oh, well. What happened to this person?
[5835.99s -> 5860.47s]  Is somebody still here? Oh, shit. Sorry. I'm trying to do it fast. You want me to pay full price for
[5860.47s -> 5865.54s]  this? What? It's a... It's a bag of snacks. What are you talking about? Sweep them.
[5871.45s -> 5881.22s]  No, it doesn't work. You can't... You can't sweep people. It doesn't work. Hey, Paul. Where's our
[5881.22s -> 5905.53s]  goddamn money? What the... I don't understand. Is that one of the guys' cars that I threw
[5905.53s -> 5925.29s]  like an hour ago? I didn't read the emails. I'm not dead, right? Is this my uncle? What happened?
[5925.85s -> 5935.67s]  This is where you get ghosted by emails for six years. All those times I said,
[5935.67s -> 5945.10s]  Merry Christmas. All the times I said, let me see the baby. Wake up, Sam. You've got a gas station
[5952.50s -> 5971.05s]  What? Was I rescued by uncle? And who is that guy? Wait, what? Wasn't he just here?
[5974.49s -> 5977.85s]  Why wouldn't we just talk? Why doesn't he left and called me?
[5978.49s -> 5985.05s]  There was a mistake, a serious one. You can rest easy knowing I will have the responsible people
[5985.05s -> 5991.61s]  dealt proper retribution for what has happened. Wait, the amount of time on your investment
[5991.61s -> 5997.93s]  I'm not taking on anyone was rendered far too short for what the amount was. It's plain bad
[5997.93s -> 6006.23s]  business. And I don't make bad business decisions. Let's forget about this debacle for the time being
[6006.79s -> 6013.51s]  as a token of apology, please accept this small gift. It will help with your next delivery.
[6013.51s -> 6020.87s]  No strings attached. However, you will need to make the warehouse operational again. I don't want
[6020.87s -> 6026.79s]  alone. I'm doing it somehow with what I have in cash. You're a resolute land. You'll figure it out.
[6028.07s -> 6041.86s]  Okay, thanks, uncle. All right. All right. I hold on to have a gas. You stay right there.
[6042.82s -> 6051.54s]  Just as I want. Okay, but I'm gonna I've been restocked things. I think I need to buy fuel
[6053.26s -> 6072.17s]  decorations. And I just do that. Wait, hold on. It seems to be actually more cost efficient than
[6072.17s -> 6082.26s]  the actual gas station. 12 to 20 bucks every time. In the conveyor belt. Oh, shit, you're right.
[6084.62s -> 6099.98s]  This is so dirty. I can't I have to wait till somebody's here. 33. I have enough. Read emails.
[6099.98s -> 6108.39s]  All right, fine. Alone. Feel free to ask for a little pick me up. You can reach out from your
[6108.39s -> 6116.50s]  PC a one time injection of $1,000 should pop you back on your feet. Yep. Okay. Cash register. We
[6116.50s -> 6124.09s]  already know how to do this. We know how to do all this. We know about Dennis. Okay, I need the
[6124.89s -> 6130.90s]  sponge. Here we go. All right. I don't mess with your stuff here. Let's go.
[6131.54s -> 6153.91s]  One more. All right. Come on in. Email waiting room. No, stop it. Good. Very good.
[6156.38s -> 6165.26s]  Just throw it on the floor. No, they leave if you do that. This is a huge eyesore. I really need to
[6165.26s -> 6186.65s]  get rid of that. Whatever it is. Oh, shit. Turn it on. Thank you. How are you doing? Bye. All right.
[6187.21s -> 6191.05s]  Complete all challenges to be able to upgrade the gas station. Okay, I get to buy an outdoor
[6191.05s -> 6205.91s]  decoration. I get outdoor small table. I can only buy a small table. How many bucks are I get it?
[6206.55s -> 6217.77s]  I guess it just stays in a static place. Okay. All right. I got gas. I've got, I got to order
[6217.77s -> 6232.57s]  more food. Purchase the level two upgrade to your gas station. Can I afford it? Level one. Level up.
[6233.21s -> 6243.90s]  So it's free. Hey, why did the paint go off? I upgraded level two to strip the paint.
[6253.37s -> 6259.00s]  No shit. You get that for free. Whatever. I don't care. Don't be mad that you got a carton of milk
[6259.00s -> 6264.78s]  for free. I, why are people so pissed about that? All right. Find a way to enter the warehouse and
[6264.78s -> 6289.90s]  open its gates. I need more stock. No, I can't do it yet. Oh, thank you. All right. Goodbye.
[6289.90s -> 6304.39s]  Anybody? Yep. Come here. See you later. What are you doing back here? All right. Find a way to enter
[6304.39s -> 6323.42s]  the warehouse and open its gates. Okay. I got a key. All right. What do we got? One bag of potato chips.
[6323.90s -> 6334.17s]  Thanks a bunch. You're welcome. You have a peanut sized brain that's smooth, creamy,
[6334.17s -> 6346.49s]  and delicious. Is that supposed to be an insult? What does that do with the hay?
[6347.13s -> 6371.67s]  Do I need that for anything? What is this? Press F to play. What? How do you play? Change chord?
[6372.23s -> 6444.23s]  Okay. A S D Z. Oh, I didn't want to leave. Sounds like an organ. I told you guys before about that
[6444.23s -> 6450.87s]  stream that I watched. This is like, I don't know, it's probably back at like, like just in TV days.
[6450.87s -> 6455.80s]  This is like before we was even Twitch. I thought there was this, there was this guy that had
[6455.80s -> 6462.54s]  headphones on and the music was blasting into his ears and he was sleeping and you could like
[6462.54s -> 6467.34s]  activate a thing that would blast music in his ears or play something in his ears while he was
[6467.34s -> 6473.98s]  asleep. And he's just sitting there in this dark, weird, like kind of dark room and the cam,
[6473.98s -> 6479.59s]  webcam's kind of all pixelated and he's just in his bed with these big bulky headphones on.
[6479.59s -> 6487.03s]  And all you hear is like this blown out, overdone, like just absolute blown out piano mashing keys.
[6487.59s -> 6497.48s]  Just like this dude just sitting there with his eyes closed. It was fucking mayhem.
[6502.57s -> 6509.67s]  I don't even know where you find that song. Like I don't even understand. I was sitting there
[6509.67s -> 6518.97s]  just going, what the fuck is going on man? I was laughing so hard. But it was just somebody was
[6518.97s -> 6527.82s]  just hammering like dozens and dozens of piano keys. Not a keyboard, a piano. The ones, you know,
[6527.82s -> 6532.06s]  an old fashioned piano where you have to put weight down on the keys. So sometimes it's like
[6532.70s -> 6541.67s]  done, done, depending on the pressure. So it was just all over the place. God, it's the funniest
[6541.67s -> 6555.19s]  fucking thing ever. This customer is hold on. Reset all cars. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I need to
[6555.19s -> 6564.89s]  open the gate. Wait, hold on. I'll be back. What is this? A wrench? No, don't throw a saw at somebody.
[6564.89s -> 6578.14s]  Customers. It was just so damn funny. It really was. Mainly the fact that it's just he had a stone
[6578.14s -> 6587.93s]  cold just default blank face with huge headphones on. It was so abnormal. Like that was the perfect
[6587.93s -> 6602.15s]  word to describe it. It was just so abnormal. I think about it all the time. Good job. You're
[6602.15s -> 6605.75s]  trying to prove a point to people that already believe. No, I'm just so excited to talk about
[6605.75s -> 6623.86s]  it because it's like one of my favorite things I've ever seen. You have to recreate it. I don't
[6623.86s -> 6640.79s]  have a piano. Okay, more customers. Easy, easy. Oh my God. Okay, I have to go back. Okay, go back
[6640.79s -> 6656.01s]  to the warehouse and open the gate. Just use your thighs. I don't whatever you say. I have to open
[6656.01s -> 6667.02s]  this gate. Oh, I see. All right, let me get in here. This is a big lever on the wall. All right,
[6667.02s -> 6671.82s]  here we go. Keep your warehouse gates closed. Otherwise, someone may steal from you. What?
[6673.38s -> 6688.98s]  Remove haystacks. It doesn't really matter where those go, right? I should really probably close
[6688.98s -> 6713.99s]  the store. We've been saying that. Holy shit. Yeah, but it's been fun. All right, only three more.
[6716.28s -> 6724.98s]  Oh, right. Okay, there is that right here. Yeah. Oh, let me go. I'm going to go close the store.
[6724.98s -> 6739.80s]  Let me serve the customers here and then I'm closing. I still have plenty of gas.
[6742.36s -> 6755.00s]  All right. I'm almost out of stuff. I need to order more food. Thank you. Remember, you're the
[6755.00s -> 6763.00s]  type of guy that wakes up your significant other to tell them you're going to bed. No, I'm the type
[6763.00s -> 6771.32s]  of guy that if my significant other is sleeping, I do everything possible to not be heard at all.
[6772.20s -> 6779.72s]  It takes me like 15 seconds to close the door if they're sleeping in that room. If I need to
[6779.72s -> 6792.76s]  brush my teeth, I brush my teeth in a different room and I move around unheard. Oh shit, I gotta
[6792.76s -> 6815.37s]  take this out. Crash. Do you normally brush your teeth in a bedroom? Well, no, but I make sure that
[6815.37s -> 6827.74s]  like I... Oh fuck, I just got caught. I just got caught and I didn't even know. You know,
[6827.82s -> 6833.78s]  like then when that happens, I just got caught because what that means for you is like,
[6833.78s -> 6839.14s]  wait, what are you talking about? I'm a walk-in brush. I walk around and brush my teeth. I walk
[6839.14s -> 6847.22s]  around like my place and brush my teeth. So I just got, yeah, I'm kind of a weird guy.
[6848.78s -> 6857.83s]  My toothbrush travels around. Sometimes it's in the shower. Sometimes it's on like the kitchen
[6857.83s -> 6870.02s]  sink. Sometimes it's in the bathroom. Yeah, I clean it. Not in the toilet, like in the...
[6870.98s -> 6881.85s]  What do you brush your teeth? That's not normal. Yes, it is. The gas station's closed.
[6881.85s -> 6899.03s]  Oh, why did he come in here? A red fucking sign. Bathroom sink. We're closed. We're closed.
[6902.02s -> 6916.81s]  You're just gonna have to get back in your car and leave. Just go. We're closed. I really wanted
[6916.81s -> 6930.89s]  to go into like the stratosphere with this one. There it is. That was a big spin too. What's wrong
[6930.89s -> 6940.73s]  with me? Okay. All right. Now that it's closed, I have some money. I need to finish painting.
[6945.00s -> 6950.12s]  Yeah, I brush my teeth. I, guys, I used to... Okay. I am one of those people that thinks brushing
[6950.12s -> 6968.09s]  your teeth in the shower is more efficient. It's more efficient. I don't do it all the time, but
[6969.62s -> 6973.46s]  okay, let's say for instance, I'm going to give you a real example here because I mean, I'm going
[6973.46s -> 6981.03s]  to... I'm just going to tell you real stuff, okay? This is real things. So let's just say a stream is
[6981.03s -> 6988.01s]  about to start. How many of you guys do this? I know I'm not the only one. So you have like a
[6988.01s -> 6991.93s]  thing you're doing or like an obligation you have or an appointment or you're meeting up with friends
[6991.93s -> 6996.17s]  or whatever it is. It doesn't matter. That could be work or play related. It doesn't matter. And
[6996.17s -> 7002.41s]  you know that you only have like five minutes to get ready. Maybe 10 minutes tops. Do you
[7003.74s -> 7010.78s]  uh, count to like 60 in your head three times in the shower to guarantee that you don't get
[7010.78s -> 7019.06s]  stuck, shower stuck, because that shit happens all the time. And sometimes I will get into the
[7019.06s -> 7025.54s]  shower going, okay, I'm going to count to 60 three times. That's three minutes. And I will get to 60.
[7025.54s -> 7032.10s]  I will do... I will get to like 120 seconds and stop counting and get shower stuck.
[7033.46s -> 7038.38s]  Even if I'm trying to not do it. And then after like a couple of minutes I go,
[7038.38s -> 7046.57s]  what the fuck? I'm still in here. Oh my god. It's really easy for me to get shower stuck.
[7054.20s -> 7062.68s]  So I'll sit there counting in my head. One, two, three, four, five. While I'm brushing my teeth,
[7062.68s -> 7070.28s]  shampoo is in my hair with other hand counting. And like I need to be out of there in like 180
[7070.28s -> 7096.28s]  seconds. Aggressive ADHD. Yeah. Three minute shower Andy. Well, if you have somewhere to be,
[7096.28s -> 7102.58s]  you know, I don't, I also have to be, I have to clean myself every day. I have to. I always,
[7102.58s -> 7128.33s]  I just feel so gross. I just feel disgusting if I don't. Gross feeling Andy. Don't listen to all
[7128.33s -> 7140.30s]  the one guys. I know what you mean. It's either five minutes or 30 minutes when you take a shower.
[7140.30s -> 7145.80s]  Yeah. And why does that happen? Actually, I'm not, it's not going to be all green. We need
[7145.80s -> 7155.00s]  to have accents, right? Yeah. What should I do? White? It seems to be a full green spray painted
[7155.00s -> 7177.27s]  house. Peach? Orange? White? Let's see. I'm not doing all green. We're closed. Why are people
[7177.27s -> 7192.62s]  coming in here? Do you know what my uncle is? Shit. I'll clean it up later. I have not slept
[7192.62s -> 7211.02s]  in four days. Do you say you're supposed to sleep in this game? I think one of the worst things in
[7211.02s -> 7217.10s]  the world is when you think you have like five to 10 minutes or whatever. And then, okay, let's say
[7217.10s -> 7222.39s]  somebody's like picking you up or like you have a appointment or something. Especially if you're
[7222.39s -> 7227.51s]  on like somebody else's time too, it can be like, oh shit. Like I've gotten in the shower before
[7228.39s -> 7234.31s]  and I, the water just got hot and I just got inside of it and directly hit the water hits
[7234.31s -> 7243.59s]  the top of my head and shampoo goes in and I hear like and it's the person that is here to pick me
[7243.59s -> 7252.89s]  up. And it's like, I can't even answer the phone. I can't even answer this phone call. So you try to
[7252.89s -> 7256.17s]  get out of the shower while it's still running and you're covered in soap. Soaps going to your eyes.
[7256.17s -> 7260.01s]  It's like burning. You grab like the end of a towel to wipe your hand off enough to be able
[7260.01s -> 7265.13s]  to use the phone and you answer it and pretend like you're not in the shower. Hey, what's up, man?
[7266.50s -> 7271.54s]  Oh, hey, I'm outside. Oh, all right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just gotta take care of a couple things.
[7271.54s -> 7277.34s]  Let me just give me like a couple minutes. All the while, like your eyes are burning with soap.
[7279.18s -> 7285.51s]  You just like in the shower, like just sitting there and then you make up like some, oh,
[7285.51s -> 7289.43s]  there's some reason as to why. Yeah. I've got, I've got it. I've got something I gotta do.
[7289.43s -> 7291.99s]  Just real quick. They caught me right at the second. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be right out.
[7292.55s -> 7309.54s]  Jerma, what the fuck are you talking about? Why is that not cleaned up? Do you live in a sitcom?
[7311.45s -> 7324.81s]  No, this is, this is real shit. That really happens. I have to brush it. I would not brush
[7324.81s -> 7338.31s]  a wet paint like this. This isn't doing anything. Why? How do I get rid of that?
[7341.50s -> 7366.84s]  Repaint the column. What the hell? Brush the ground. Please. Okay. Guys,
[7368.30s -> 7373.74s]  there's a spider here. It is, it is getting late. Yeah. I hear a spider. It's getting late. I don't
[7373.74s -> 7403.06s]  have any torches. Yeah. Oh yeah. Now that's a good one. Okay. You, are you trying to tell me that
[7403.06s -> 7409.66s]  that was not a good one? That's just the Minecraft spider sound. Do I have to explain all of my
[7409.66s -> 7426.26s]  material? God, nobody gets me. All right. What am I doing? I'm in a, I'm in a weird mood. All
[7426.26s -> 7435.88s]  right. I'm sorry. It's one of those, it's one of those weird mood days. Oh, fuck. Oh,
[7436.92s -> 7453.40s]  did nobody steal anything? This has been open the whole time. Come on. Don't do this to me right
[7453.40s -> 7468.50s]  now. Don't do this to me right now. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one of Jerma
[7468.50s -> 7476.97s]  Craft. Jerma, I said it so weirdly. Jerma, Jerma Craft series where I played Minecraft,
[7477.53s -> 7505.21s]  whatever, whatever, just throw it. It went all the way over the mountain. Okay. Well, how come
[7505.21s -> 7512.89s]  nobody has sung that yet? Like a singing remix of it. And I'm talking real like power singing.
[7517.19s -> 7520.31s]  Like I need to impress everybody here by singing the national anthem,
[7521.11s -> 7528.98s]  power singing. You know what I mean? It's never just like, oh, say, can you see? Nope. It's like,
[7529.54s -> 7537.40s]  oh, say, can you see? They always have to make it. No, nobody just does it the normal way.
[7538.04s -> 7556.02s]  Did I clear this out? Is this technically trash? Not really. Recycling, shh. Recycling jokes, shh.
[7556.02s -> 7564.10s]  Stop. Don't you, like, okay. Every year or two, a bunch of new people cycle into the channel.
[7564.10s -> 7568.26s]  So we just do all the material we did two years ago. And it's brand new to everybody here. And
[7568.26s -> 7597.00s]  they stop blowing this up for me. Yeah, I guess restore the warehouse. Dusty roads. I gotta go
[7597.00s -> 7613.03s]  to the computer and turn the warehouse back on. That probably was dangerous. There is no material.
[7613.03s -> 7625.18s]  You're just insane. That's not true. Hey, what do you mean? I'm seeing, I'm seeing trues here.
[7625.74s -> 7639.61s]  I'm seeing trues to that statement. This is all okay. I have to come in here and throw this
[7640.76s -> 7661.64s]  away. What? Oh my goodness. How did I not? I thought this was the wall. Wait, what's going on?
[7661.64s -> 7668.58s]  Wasn't there a wall? I feel like I'm having an out of body experience. Oh, I upgraded. I was
[7668.58s -> 7671.62s]  going to say no way because everyone's like, you're blocking the door. What are you doing?
[7671.62s -> 7686.12s]  What are you doing? I was like, okay, I'm fine. I need a little bit more trash. I just dump it.
[7686.12s -> 7710.22s]  No, I need another little bit to get a bag. Come on. Come on. Trash on the roof. I don't think so.
[7710.78s -> 7719.78s]  This is more than a simple weed brain. He's been molded like a Resident Evil 7 monster
[7720.68s -> 7726.01s]  from marijuana. Really? I kind of don't, I don't know what you mean by that, but that's probably
[7726.01s -> 7748.58s]  funny. Wait. All right. Restore the 50 bucks. What additional products for sale? Ooh, products.
[7749.70s -> 7754.65s]  Here we go. You have several different brands of products on shelves. The customers will buy more
[7754.65s -> 7759.13s]  things. Prices change every day at midnight. Renowns indicate a bargain price. Red mean the
[7759.13s -> 7763.93s]  price is less favorable. You'll make profit regardless. However, the cheaper you buy,
[7763.93s -> 7773.13s]  the more profit you'll make. Okay. Every day at midnight, you can track the price curve by
[7773.13s -> 7777.85s]  looking at the price history. You can order only one delivery truck from each company at the same
[7777.85s -> 7791.45s]  time. I was about to burp. Should I get alcohol? Cigarettes? It means strong menthol.
[7794.94s -> 7805.32s]  This is super bland tobacco. All right. Cigarettes? How much should I buy? Oh, this is times 10.
[7806.63s -> 7819.26s]  Oh, I have 50 cartons of cigarettes. Okay. How about some, uh, some beer? I need to refill the
[7819.26s -> 7835.26s]  snacks. I'm, I'm, I'm going to be burning for money here. Okay. Sound good? Is that, is that,
[7835.26s -> 7843.37s]  is that coming? Waiting for an order? Is that coming in? How do I say order? What's the order
[7843.37s -> 7857.72s]  button? It's not this, right? Where is it? Up right? Oh, I thought that was a trash can. I thought
[7857.72s -> 7872.66s]  that was like a delete button. I don't have enough warehouse capacity. Um, okay. I don't need these
[7872.66s -> 7889.66s]  things. Insufficient warehouse space. Fuck off. Wait for the delivery truck to arrive and unpack
[7889.66s -> 7897.40s]  the products into the warehouse. I need to move a lot of this shit out of the way. This is all
[7897.40s -> 7910.38s]  trash, right? I can't sell this for anything. More shelves. I know, I know. I'm trying to move.
[7911.02s -> 7916.73s]  I got a lot of shit here that I have to get rid of. I'm going for it. Don't worry.
[7917.37s -> 7940.04s]  Yo, uh, somebody's going to take this trash. Someone's got to take this. Um, okay. Wait,
[7940.68s -> 7953.10s]  can I like unroll this carpet? It's so huge. Uh, where's the truck? There it is. All right.
[7953.66s -> 7961.38s]  You're still closed by the way. Yeah, good. I don't want to be open. You're making a sad Jesus.
[7963.32s -> 7972.52s]  Oh, um, I know. Hold on. Don't invoke the wrath of the broom. I'm telling you, don't do it.
[7973.16s -> 8000.87s]  So what do we unproc, un, unproc the, is that, oh my God, that's so, this is so much.
[8001.59s -> 8034.92s]  How much? Oh, no, no, no. Okay. Thanks. Let me get it. Take me with you. Oh, what's this?
[8040.94s -> 8044.38s]  Hey, hey, simple to guess how closely I can get before it starts to burn.
[8049.21s -> 8073.45s]  I can feel the air. What was that? Was that that kid? I think it was that kid. I just heard him.
[8073.45s -> 8096.60s]  I heard somebody go like, you're out. You're fine. Oh, just go. Where's that kid? I heard him.
[8096.60s -> 8099.24s]  All right. We've refilled the shelves with products from the warehouse.
[8100.44s -> 8110.57s]  So do I have to grab it or is it just already there or close this shit up?
[8110.57s -> 8124.04s]  I don't want anybody stealing anything. Okay. Uh, I'm going to get a trash truck to come
[8124.60s -> 8136.31s]  garbage collection. Thank you. We're getting worried about you. Why? What's I'm just messing
[8136.31s -> 8143.18s]  around, man. We're just hanging out. Okay. I need to clear this stuff out back here
[8143.18s -> 8160.74s]  because I want to move this. Where's the garbage truck coming soon? It doesn't matter if it's in
[8160.74s -> 8172.18s]  there all the way, right? What would your last meal be? Uh, a buffalo chicken sub with extra
[8172.18s -> 8194.01s]  blue cheese. You had that ready? Yeah. Buffalo chicken is one of my favorite things in the world.
[8194.01s -> 8212.92s]  All right. I need to redo this. This is going to be where the food is right here. Never mind.
[8212.92s -> 8248.87s]  Who's going to be over here? That's not perfect. Hold on enough. This can go right at the door.
[8248.87s -> 8257.03s]  Plus two buffalo chicken, minus two blue cheese. What do you put on it then? I cannot eat
[8257.03s -> 8263.83s]  Buffalo anything. Just Buffalo, Buffalo. No, I like it, but it needs something on it.
[8263.83s -> 8277.08s]  Ranch. No, we got, we have, we have ranch users here. Ranch on Buffalo chicken and not blue cheese
[8277.08s -> 8287.48s]  guys. Ranch is just like the, it's just like the not as good blue cheese to use on a buffalo
[8287.48s -> 8296.50s]  sandwich or a Buffalo chicken. If you're going to do ranch, go all the way and do blue cheese.
[8296.50s -> 8304.81s]  I mean, I guess ranch is a little lighter, but what's blue cheese? Ranch is,
[8305.85s -> 8310.26s]  I don't know. I don't get the ranch thing. I don't, I think it's okay,
[8310.90s -> 8317.94s]  but there are people that are like, Oh man, ranch. Oh my God. I love ranch the best. It's so good.
[8319.29s -> 8334.98s]  I don't know. I don't really like it that much. It's time for some ranch. He hates ranch. No,
[8334.98s -> 8341.53s]  I don't. I like it. I think it's fine. All right. I got, where are my products?
[8346.26s -> 8358.42s]  Is it in my inventory? Products. Here we go. All right. We got these cigarettes. How do I,
[8359.99s -> 8369.80s]  how do I do it? How do I get these cigarettes? How do I get, how do I get them? Oh, here we go.
[8369.80s -> 8383.08s]  How do I put cigarettes down? Refill the shelves with products. Go to the shelf and interact with
[8383.08s -> 8397.51s]  the, yeah. How do I put the cigarettes? Different shelf. Oh, it's a different shelf. Different
[8397.51s -> 8415.91s]  shelf for alcohol too. What? I have $33. I have to, Oh my God. I'm going to go bankrupt. All right.
[8415.91s -> 8428.20s]  Cigarettes. Can't be behind me right here. It's sticking out. That's all right. That's okay.
[8428.20s -> 8455.35s]  Is it too? No, this one, right? Jesus. Okay. I need that alcohol shelf. Hey,
[8456.55s -> 8466.06s]  oh, you guys said I was getting not too much. This is not too much.
[8468.01s -> 8484.25s]  There's only one popcorn. Wait, what? All right. Everything's restocked. If I come into this place
[8484.25s -> 8488.65s]  and I see the shelf, I'm not going to buy anything in here because I feel like that it has never been
[8488.65s -> 8498.52s]  restocked and they don't restock until it goes to zero. It could be 10 years. I have 74. All right.
[8498.92s -> 8509.75s]  Open it. Your uncle has words for you. What? I see you're putting hard work into keeping your
[8509.75s -> 8518.87s]  station running again, kid. Good. Good. I wouldn't have it any other way. I just wanted to remind you
[8518.87s -> 8525.43s]  I'm not the only one judging your performance. Sure. Your uncle knows better how to keep a
[8525.43s -> 8533.11s]  business going and wants to see you flourish, but my approval only goes so far. The real approval
[8533.11s -> 8540.31s]  you need to watch out for is the one given to you by your customers. If word of slander gets out,
[8540.31s -> 8547.11s]  you might even sell Egyptian diamonds for free and nobody will bat an eye. Keep those customers
[8547.11s -> 8551.43s]  happy. Popularity. You hear? Gather positive feedback from customers who increase the popularity
[8551.43s -> 8555.75s]  of your station. Higher popularity increases traffic around your station, which increases
[8555.75s -> 8562.46s]  the amount of customers coming by. Okay. All right. So we are actually looking for Yelp reviews.
[8565.05s -> 8568.44s]  Uh, I'm going to open it up. Open for business. Let's go.
[8569.00s -> 8593.35s]  Ooh, clean this up. You can get more than one in one go. All right. It's pretty clean in here.
[8593.91s -> 8612.20s]  Okay. Looks pretty perfect. Ain't the inside. Can I? Oh, what color should I do? Uh, how about
[8612.92s -> 8620.68s]  what color should I do? Orange? Peach? No, not green. I'm not going to do green.
[8622.30s -> 8653.00s]  Ah, it's kind of ugly. I have to commit to it though for now. Yup. Coming.
[8654.63s -> 8666.02s]  One, two, three, four. We've got cigarettes. We've got snacks. We've got beer. I don't know. I'm
[8666.02s -> 8672.58s]  fucked up today. I'm sorry. You can, I, okay. You can always tell when I'm in a fairly good mood
[8674.15s -> 8694.38s]  based on how odd I am in front of everybody. Oh, where is it? It's a different color. Is this a
[8694.38s -> 8716.46s]  different color? I can't tell. It might be. Is it? That's a different color. What are you looking
[8716.46s -> 8736.06s]  for? You're looking for the beer. The beer is right there. Not the right brand. What'd you get?
[8736.06s -> 8755.11s]  Good choices. Good choices. Good choices. All right. Come on in. What do you got? Got a beer.
[8755.11s -> 8766.39s]  Yup. And some snacks. Thanks for coming. Have you have a wonderful day. I'll take care of that.
[8770.10s -> 8776.14s]  Whoa. I went a little over. I didn't look. I tried to stop. It didn't stop. Whatever. Who cares?
[8776.54s -> 8794.58s]  Be stranded. No, I, I, I, the whole point of having a gas station out here is to make sure I can
[8795.14s -> 8805.78s]  serve the customers that need, um, get some stuff, right? I got to order some more fuel,
[8807.50s -> 8816.14s]  more parking. Oh shit. 399. That's too much. I need fuel.
[8820.86s -> 8848.15s]  200. Shit. Um, my moon is huge. You don't, dude. Okay. Can I talk about this? This most nerve
[8848.15s -> 8852.47s]  racking thing in the world. Some fast food restaurants do this now where you order with
[8852.47s -> 8857.27s]  the person that's like walking and running with your car. I hate it. It freaks me out. I'm not
[8857.27s -> 8869.53s]  ready. Chick-fil-A. Yeah. I w it was so much anxiety inducing. I was just like, what the fuck?
[8870.17s -> 8876.89s]  Cause I don't. Okay. I usually don't know what I want when I go anywhere. I usually don't. I usually
[8876.89s -> 8883.29s]  kind of figure that out. I look at like a menu, whatever. And this person's holding up a laminated
[8883.29s -> 8890.30s]  menu, walking with the car. I'm just like, what the fuck is going on? I don't, I have to drive the
[8890.30s -> 8905.96s]  car. I have to drive the car because there's just like 700,000 people that go to Chick-fil-A.
[8908.74s -> 8913.53s]  Every, I don't. Okay. I know that like, okay. Chick-fil-A, right? Oh, they've got good chicken.
[8913.53s -> 8919.62s]  It's okay. It's good. It's good. But this car, it's just like, what the hell is going on here?
[8927.42s -> 8937.43s]  It's like 50 cars in line all day. I would just go to McDonald's. I'm not, I'm just going to drive
[8937.43s -> 8953.05s]  by that. You know what I mean? It's like, holy shit. That's like ridiculous. Oh, come here. You're
[8953.05s -> 8958.55s]  looking for, there's beer. You're looking at, he just, isn't that the exact beer that he just said
[8958.55s -> 8972.01s]  he wanted? I went to Chick-fil-A and In-N-Out today and yeah, In-N-Out's the same way. In-N-Out's
[8972.01s -> 8998.07s]  just, there's so many people. It's just always there. Come on, come on. Yo, me, $5. In-N-Out
[8998.07s -> 9004.89s]  is overrated. Be careful. Be careful. I said that before and I was nearly, I was nearly killed.
[9005.77s -> 9023.72s]  Be careful. Don't say that. The chat chimpanzees were not happy about that. I don't have enough
[9023.72s -> 9038.60s]  money for this. I, all I said, listen, all I said was that I, I, I, when I order food from In-N-Out,
[9038.60s -> 9046.71s]  why do they put it like in a half-open bag? If I'm not eating in the restaurant, wrap the whole
[9046.71s -> 9062.31s]  thing. Wrap the sandwich up. I don't want it in a half-open bag. Have you ever had Whataburger?
[9062.31s -> 9066.62s]  No, I haven't. I've never had Whataburger. I've always wanted to, but this never, I never had an
[9066.62s -> 9079.75s]  opportunity. Who's beeping? And actually, okay, it could be time for me to do an updated tier list
[9079.75s -> 9084.87s]  because I feel like I've eaten a lot of, of the fast foods I have not had before. For instance,
[9084.87s -> 9093.77s]  I think I mentioned this before, but holy shit, Jack in the Box is unbelievably good. I couldn't
[9093.77s -> 9099.19s]  believe it. I was like, this is fucking unbelievable. I was like, what? I've only had it maybe once in
[9099.19s -> 9104.71s]  my whole life before I had it before. And I was like, yeah, it's okay. Dude, I had their burger and
[9104.71s -> 9122.04s]  I was like, this is like good. This is like really good. What, what is it going on? It's underrated,
[9122.04s -> 9127.08s]  but it's not that good. I think I, okay, I think my brain was expecting it to be terrible,
[9127.96s -> 9134.54s]  but when I realized it wasn't terrible, my brain put it up like three tiers. What do I mean?
[9134.94s -> 9153.08s]  Great job. Your tacos are horrendous. I mean, I kind of, kind of like those,
[9157.96s -> 9166.76s]  kind of like those, but it's whatever. Wait, it's already at the gas pump. I am almost at a gas.
[9177.93s -> 9187.91s]  Cigarettes and beer. Have a nice day. Okay. Buy a toilet. Not yet.
[9189.43s -> 9209.38s]  Need that. You try Boston Market. Um, I've had Boston Market, I think a handful of times of my
[9209.38s -> 9214.26s]  life. I remember it was good, but I don't, they're not really out here. I don't think
[9214.26s -> 9223.00s]  there's a Boston Market out here. Could be wrong, but I don't think so. That fuel here.
[9228.22s -> 9251.72s]  Please finish painting. You got it. I was looking at chat. My bad. What was the cop doing?
[9252.44s -> 9291.90s]  He got out of his car? The wrong orange. It's okay. I'll replace it later. What he said is this
[9291.90s -> 9332.18s]  portal to gas station. Let's go with that. Sure. Okay. Fuel's here. Why would you come to the back
[9332.18s -> 9349.30s]  to leave? Just turn and do a three. You're going to have to wait. Thank you. All right. Um,
[9350.18s -> 9377.58s]  finish the paint job. Actually looks terrible. Okay. That don't matter. Hey, yeah. I know I need
[9377.58s -> 9410.81s]  a bathroom. I'll make it in a moment. Okay. What do you need? Very good. How much gas do I have?
[9410.81s -> 9430.50s]  103. Now I need. All right. Okay. I think we're good. I got to, that's ugly. I have to paint that,
[9430.50s -> 9477.02s]  don't I? I can paint the roof. What? I want someone to fill their tank. I do white, darker color.
[9477.02s -> 9516.34s]  What do you think? I do. What color should I do? Okay. Let's do this color. Peach about, uh, maroon.
[9524.10s -> 9552.90s]  Uh, my eyes. I'm just, I'm seeing what the colors we have. I could just do this. I like the gray.
[9552.90s -> 9564.30s]  Well, a resident sleeper. It's a neutral color. It's a roof. What do you want to paint the roof?
[9564.30s -> 9607.72s]  Like teal? I think it looks nice. I don't care what you say. You're a Slytherin. You have customers.
[9607.72s -> 9624.68s]  Don't they see what I'm doing? Ah, paint all over me. What? Did you do that? You bring a dog in here?
[9624.68s -> 9648.30s]  You bring a dog in here? What happened? You have millennial humor? Um, I just want to make sure that
[9648.30s -> 9660.98s]  you're aware of this. I'm, I'm a millennial. I think I probably, I, that's how, that's how old I am.
[9666.28s -> 9686.95s]  Oh my God. Gasp. Wipe your feet before you come in here. Come on. What is this millennial humor?
[9686.95s -> 9713.98s]  What kind of humor do you like? What's your humor? Zoomer humor? Zoomer humor is interesting to me
[9713.98s -> 9722.71s]  because I either hate it completely or I think it's hysterical. There's no in-between for me with
[9722.71s -> 9768.70s]  like, uh, kind of Gen Z's humor. Can you buy something? All right, come on. Wait, you first.
[9768.70s -> 9775.06s]  Please don't rant about how popular you'd be on TikTok. Please. I'm not going to do that. Don't
[9775.06s -> 9788.95s]  worry. We're not doing that right now. I was not about to. No, I'm, I'm full of shit. Don't worry.
[9788.95s -> 9793.35s]  There's one thing that you guys can know and you probably already do is, you know, I'm full of shit.
[9793.91s -> 9816.28s]  You know what I mean? Like, I just am. Okay. Do I have enough for a bathroom? Toilet. How much is 50
[9816.28s -> 9836.12s]  bucks? That's it. Okay. Sure. Make it. Do a funny sound effect. Is that, did you like that?
[9836.92s -> 9855.69s]  That was so funny. You guys are fucking so funny. Okay. What, uh, I don't, I didn't mean that
[9855.69s -> 9866.26s]  sarcastically either. I really believe that. All right. Uh, I don't need a lawn. I have a toilet now.
[9866.26s -> 9879.66s]  I have to clean the toilet. Where is it? I don't even know where it is. Excuse me. Where's your
[9879.66s -> 9890.89s]  bathroom? I don't know. It's somewhere attached to this building. Put new floors in? Maybe eventually.
[9890.89s -> 9904.10s]  The weed kick in? Oh, a little bit. Somewhat. I, I'm kidding. There's 15,000 people here. Holy shit.
[9911.38s -> 9914.26s]  All right. So they very, they want, okay. They want different beer.
[9916.47s -> 9927.21s]  I need to order. People keep asking for this one and this one's expensive. Okay. Don't go overboard
[9927.21s -> 9932.47s]  here, but people will keep asking for these. How much is it going to cost? 100 bucks.
[9933.99s -> 9944.26s]  Hey, they keep asking for the same beer. Clean the toilet. No one's even used it.
[9949.37s -> 9959.61s]  Nobody's used the bathroom. Why would I need to clean the bathroom? What the, what the fuck?
[9960.17s -> 9970.76s]  Excuse me. Um, excuse me. Why is there a big shit log on the ground? I just opened this. What?
[9975.58s -> 9986.68s]  Oh, don't pick it up with your hands. Oh my God. That was disgusting. Do not touch that with your
[9986.68s -> 10002.39s]  hands. No. Oh no. I didn't wash my hands. I'll use the sponge. Jesus. I'm so, I want to let you know
[10002.39s -> 10007.91s]  I didn't wash my hands and I was just in the bathroom. I want you to know. So make sure you
[10007.91s -> 10016.97s]  wash your hands too. That's disgusting. What the, what am I doing? Would you just put it all back?
[10016.97s -> 10025.43s]  I don't even know what I would do if somebody said that. Yeah. Have a nice day. Oh, by the way,
[10025.43s -> 10029.35s]  I didn't not wash my hands, but I just used the other bathroom. It'd be like, okay, well,
[10029.35s -> 10040.74s]  I want a fucking refund and I'm washing my hands and you think five times and I want you to give
[10040.74s -> 10047.10s]  me $20. I want, I want you to give me $20 and the health inspector is going to get here too.
[10053.93s -> 10057.85s]  Oh, okay. You're throwing it for some reason. I thought she was saying like, let's go. Like
[10057.85s -> 10061.69s]  let's throw down. Like she was like pointing down. Like let's go. You and me right here.
[10062.65s -> 10081.42s]  Delivery truck. Shit. Coming. I don't have time for this. Thanks for coming. Appreciate it.
[10081.98s -> 10100.12s]  I'll get out. Bye. Thanks. Have a good day. Here. Have a few like bags of potatoes or whatever
[10100.12s -> 10128.65s]  rice, whatever this is. Howdy. Fresh beer. You got it. All right. I'm making money. The door,
[10128.65s -> 10142.28s]  the warehouse door. Yep. Shit. Be hopping doesn't work. Shit. I'm in trouble. Usually I get around
[10142.28s -> 10157.74s]  games like that. Is that in games anymore? It's not right. Cause that was like essentially a
[10157.74s -> 10163.18s]  broken piece of code that people used. People don't put B hopping in first person shooters
[10163.18s -> 10179.61s]  anymore. Do they? Boomer shooter, boomer shooters still have it. What's your guys favorite boomer
[10179.61s -> 10183.85s]  shooter? I feel like I want to know what the kind of crowd has to say about this. What do you,
[10183.85s -> 10212.74s]  what is yours? Money. I don't think TF2 is a boomer shooter. I mean, maybe a little bit
[10217.82s -> 10227.24s]  cigarettes. That's 20 bucks. You know, those are bad for you. It's so bad for you. You shouldn't
[10227.24s -> 10240.60s]  be. You should quit smoking. Did you read the surgeon general warning on the back? I just want
[10240.60s -> 10245.56s]  to make sure you did. Did you read the surgeon general's warning? Yep. Just making sure you did.
[10246.12s -> 10264.82s]  Those are not good for you. This is bad for you. You have a gas. Oh, I'm almost out of fuel.
[10265.70s -> 10277.02s]  I need to restock the shelves too. Hey, there you go. Now you have some variety.
[10277.02s -> 10312.98s]  The toilet. Oh, were you just in there? Oh, that's not how you clean up that. Hey,
[10313.62s -> 10335.22s]  get rid of the rest of this trash. I can't use that brush anywhere else. All right. We're going
[10335.22s -> 10359.82s]  to paint this white. It's bathroom. It's going to look like clean, fresh. I have a workshop from
[10359.82s -> 10363.26s]  the main PC hub. There's a lot more to this game than I thought there was going to be.
[10365.11s -> 10372.23s]  I came into this game without, I'm sure I shouldn't be in here. It's being painted.
[10373.11s -> 10403.13s]  Have a nice day. Can I even go in there and paint that? I don't think I can. I paint it.
[10403.13s -> 10412.42s]  Looks like I can, but I can't open the doors here. Oh, I can. All right. That's kind of a weird
[10412.42s -> 10443.10s]  setup though. Customers, customers, customers. I know I'm going. Sorry for the wait. He said to
[10443.10s -> 10462.50s]  paint the bathroom. What do you got? Have your cigarettes. I don't know why I'm so like passive
[10462.50s -> 10467.78s]  aggressive with it right now. Like I'm selling them. Yeah. Like what am I talking about?
[10477.21s -> 10513.69s]  It's a lot. Almost out of gas. Trash. Thanks for coming. Bathroom's clean. Somebody said poop.
[10513.69s -> 10527.26s]  Ha ha ha ha. I'm glad you think it's funny. Can I even paint this back wall? I don't think I can.
[10527.26s -> 10544.58s]  I want to paint the back wall. Can I not? Did we have a raid? Did we? I don't see a raid.
[10545.14s -> 10566.97s]  Make that up. You made that up. I don't see a raid. You made that up. All right. Well, whatever.
[10566.97s -> 10583.48s]  This stuff is so boarded up. I have to take care of that. How do I take these boards off?
[10583.48s -> 10607.90s]  I can't paint the dumpster. I can't buy more fuel. Oh, I don't know what that is, but I can't
[10607.90s -> 10628.04s]  afford it. Customers. I'm here. I'm ready. Looking for any stray trash. Trash, trash, trash. Nope.
[10628.04s -> 10657.02s]  Okay. This room going to the bathroom. There's two people in there. Where is everybody? I need to
[10657.02s -> 10675.29s]  tell people about this place and more people come so I can have more orders. But you got to wait.
[10675.85s -> 10725.27s]  I got a big combo going. Only one more seagull. Huh? What? Oh, say later. Thanks for the fuel.
[10725.27s -> 10736.54s]  All right. I need features. No, I need to make some more money. I need 300 bucks to restore that
[10736.54s -> 10763.72s]  thing. Evening. In here. How much do you need? Oops. I didn't mean to click it twice. I just
[10763.72s -> 10796.18s]  want to get up on the roof. Does he even know I'm on here? This person. So where are we going?
[10802.28s -> 10825.27s]  I'm going to do this because yeah, I'm terrified about this. What will happen? Come on. From
[10825.27s -> 10846.86s]  downtown. Ugly shot. I love that game. I could play that game for like the next 100 years and
[10846.86s -> 10873.10s]  be fine. Is that like important? It's not like my luggage or anything, right? He's heating up.
[10873.10s -> 10877.18s]  Yeah. When you got on fire, you just steal the ball and shoot from anywhere on the court.
[10877.18s -> 10886.25s]  Make your friends go mad. Steal the ball. And you would shoot the fireball and you just sink it
[10886.25s -> 10915.18s]  every time. Oh my God. You find a lot of shit. Good. Okay. I need 300. These are the expensive
[10915.18s -> 10923.66s]  ones. They're like 10 bucks a bottle. You imitate the sounds of shoes squeaking on a basketball
[10923.66s -> 10961.24s]  court. Yeah. Is there any other requests? All right. 250. I need 300. Emulate my father coming
[10961.24s -> 10975.10s]  home. Hey kid. It's me. Your dear old dad. What's your report card look? Oh, you got a B minus in
[10975.10s -> 10997.29s]  science. I had bad time in science too, son. Don't worry about it. I heard that little shit kid.
[10997.29s -> 11002.36s]  Where is he? No, I'm not going away. I'm like, I'm going to spray him. Where is he? Where is he?
[11002.36s -> 11019.34s]  Where is he? I heard him. Where is he? Where is this kid? Is he in the bathroom? I don't know
[11019.34s -> 11051.05s]  where this kid is. Get out of here. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Yeah. Do you see what's going on with kids
[11051.05s -> 11072.31s]  these days? What's going on with kids? What's going on here? $20. $8. Yeah. I don't know what's
[11072.31s -> 11103.11s]  going on with kids, man. Honestly. Sweep the floor. Oh shit. The Minecraft spider joke. I think was
[11103.91s -> 11127.59s]  a 10 out of 10. I can't believe nobody liked that. I'm shocked. I can't believe it. Awesome. Okay.
[11127.99s -> 11139.46s]  How's my inventory? It's pretty good. I have cigarette batteries. I need another few customers
[11139.46s -> 11147.21s]  and I can do the workshop. I have to take care of the paint. What did he write? He wrote like,
[11147.21s -> 11170.30s]  fuck you. Where is it? Where is it? Yeah. Fuck school. It's supposed to be in school.
[11172.81s -> 11189.90s]  Fuck school. What are you getting? Finally, somebody actually orders a half tank of gas.
[11195.54s -> 11204.92s]  Workshop time. Restore. How many saltines can you fit in your mouth at the same time?
[11205.56s -> 11210.81s]  Probably two. I mean, more than that, but why would you do that? It's kind of dangerous.
[11210.81s -> 11221.61s]  It's like bad. Wait for the client in the workshop and fix his car? Wait, I'm a mechanic now?
[11222.33s -> 11230.44s]  Wait for the customer to leave the car and press the button on the left to start the repairs.
[11231.24s -> 11236.44s]  Use your skills to see which areas require your attention. Before you start repairing,
[11236.44s -> 11241.32s]  make sure you have enough spare parts and the right tool in your hand. Restocking car parts
[11241.32s -> 11245.80s]  is done in the exact same way as ordering new products to tell. Use the delivery tab on your
[11245.80s -> 11266.60s]  PC. Well, shit. I'm going to have to do this a little bit later. I need to make money. No,
[11266.60s -> 11276.98s]  not yet. I can stay. How are we doing? All right. You're the kind of person that eats Doritos
[11276.98s -> 11302.02s]  vertically. When you're 3D, you're in a 3D world. Doritos 3D. Crunch the power. I don't know why.
[11302.82s -> 11306.95s]  I don't know why I do this thing where I'm deliberately trying to make you hate me.
[11307.67s -> 11313.83s]  You know what I mean? I find it's kind of humorous, but I don't want anyone to actually
[11313.83s -> 11321.85s]  really hate me. Maybe I should cut back on those, please deliberately hate my guts references.
[11322.49s -> 11332.73s]  Okay. Wait for the client. I don't think I can fix this person's car. Is it you?
[11333.61s -> 11361.56s]  All right. What's wrong with it? What's wrong with your car? Are you going into the repair shop?
[11362.20s -> 11376.54s]  The repair shop is that way. This is how we go real fast.
[11385.99s -> 11406.23s]  One of us is going to puke and it ain't going to be me. All right. I'm out. Get me out.
[11411.46s -> 11420.04s]  You have unread mail. Yeah. You know what I do with mail? You know what I do with mail? I don't
[11420.04s -> 11433.93s]  know. I shred it. That would have been funnier if I didn't start doing that weird voice. I don't know
[11433.93s -> 11442.68s]  why people send so much shit. I really don't. Why? What's the point? People send so much junk.
[11442.76s -> 11454.54s]  Have you guys seen those pretend invoices? You've seen these yet? I swear if there's bugs.
[11454.54s -> 11461.56s]  Bugs? Where it's like this piece of paper that's filled out as if you had potentially ordered a
[11461.56s -> 11466.14s]  product or like, oh, here, here's like this is going to do that. We're going to be doing this.
[11466.14s -> 11469.98s]  We're going to be doing this. And they had it signed at the bottom. I like the guy,
[11472.07s -> 11475.03s]  the owner of the company, whatever. And you look at it and you're like, wait, what the, what is this?
[11477.19s -> 11484.71s]  And it looks like it's on paper, like written paper. It's really weird. It's a good advertising
[11484.71s -> 11489.86s]  technique to be like, well, this is what your invoice could look like if you used
[11492.31s -> 11508.70s]  BNA Stevenson. Oh my God. Somebody in the garage. Hi. How can I help you? I'm wrong with the power
[11508.70s -> 11518.52s]  steering. Yeah. Power steering. Sometimes it's fluid. Sometimes it's, um, why do I have a timer?
[11519.32s -> 11534.76s]  I need a new car battery. I don't have any of this stuff. Let me see what we got here.
[11535.86s -> 11546.23s]  Uh, let me just go like this. Okay. Maybe one more of those. I think we'll do.
[11547.75s -> 11570.15s]  Okay. I mean, use the saw a little bit. I don't have any materials. It's immune. Oh shit. People
[11570.15s -> 11594.26s]  let's register. How am I supposed to do all this? You need more CPU thermal paste. Yeah. All right.
[11594.26s -> 11606.73s]  I, I have to buy a bunch of shit products, car care. I'm, I need to be level three car care.
[11622.79s -> 11639.59s]  All right. So I need to buy a car battery. I don't understand. I need tire, need new
[11639.59s -> 11647.70s]  mirror to start fixing old mirror, need wheel and need scratch remover. Where am I supposed
[11647.70s -> 11661.77s]  to get all of this stuff? Use the delivery tab on the PC. It's on the wall. That's not it.
[11664.49s -> 11681.72s]  Tires are here. What are you talking about? You have them. There's a fusion. It's a fusion.
[11683.21s -> 11721.91s]  I don't have car parts. Okay. Take it on there. Nope. I need a car door, scratch remover. Where is
[11721.91s -> 11737.67s]  it? Oh, it's this. It's the stupid thing I was doing. Okay. And what else we got? You need a
[11737.67s -> 11754.36s]  mirror. You need a car mirror. Here we go. Ow, my finger. Okay. That'll be, uh, that'll be $1,700.
[11755.48s -> 11775.43s]  What are you going to do it yourself? Nope. You're fucked. I need to order car. I don't have enough
[11775.43s -> 11793.46s]  money to do any of that yet. People let their register. Nobody's getting gas. I have a really
[11793.46s -> 11807.43s]  bad reputation for gas or something. How come there's no cars been pulled up? Life saver.
[11807.43s -> 11815.02s]  No lifesavers are under the register. I'll see you again soon. Take it easy. Take it easy, Jake.
[11815.02s -> 11831.75s]  Thanks for coming into your mic. That's how you get the good reviews. Uh, car parts function
[11831.75s -> 11835.83s]  identical to purchasing products. Prices change every day. Yeah. Greenhouse indicated bargain
[11835.83s -> 11861.34s]  price. Yeah. Yeah. I already have plenty of these. I've wasted like three of them. How much do you
[11861.34s -> 11881.64s]  need? All right. What are you plus doing? The floor. What are you guys tracking in? Probably
[11881.64s -> 11894.97s]  should clean the bathroom too, right? Probably a good idea. Can you take a potty break? Um,
[11894.97s -> 11903.66s]  yeah, we'll take a break in a minute. Get some water. Uh, 400 bucks. All right. I'm slowly
[11903.66s -> 11924.04s]  accumulating money though. That's a good thing. It's been three hours. I need to get some more
[11924.04s -> 11927.96s]  food. I think that's important. No, I need to, I don't need to know. I need more money.
[11928.60s -> 11933.13s]  My reputation is pretty high. Oh, I got to clean that bathroom before you go in there.
[11933.69s -> 11950.57s]  Don't go in. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Oh, whatever. Anything from Sonic?
[11952.81s -> 11966.70s]  Um, no, not really. I know people looking for Pringles and yeah, I know.
[11967.58s -> 11987.43s]  Oh, super. You don't have any soap dispensers? I don't think I can buy them. Once I get over
[11987.43s -> 11999.06s]  600 bucks, I'm going to start ordering new stuff. The only snack you have are those awful little
[11999.06s -> 12017.13s]  Debbie cakes. Why did I just throw that in the trash? Any more fuel? Yeah, I do. That's essential.
[12017.13s -> 12040.50s]  So I'm going to buy it. Are you high? No, really not. I have no more products.
[12041.22s -> 12055.86s]  Please, when are you going to do more tier lists? They're objectively your best content.
[12056.74s -> 12065.24s]  I mean, I did them all. All the ones everybody wanted, you know, cereal, fast food, snacks,
[12065.24s -> 12074.74s]  drinks, cheese. I did pretty much all of them. Pretty much all the ones that people would want
[12074.74s -> 12085.98s]  to see. Seasoning tier list. That's all right. That's you've piqued my interest a little.
[12086.54s -> 12120.57s]  Okay. The truck is here. New tier list after the break. No, I'm not doing tier list right now.
[12121.37s -> 12130.86s]  Maybe we'll do that in the middle of the week. Maybe. Okay. I'll find some more like
[12130.86s -> 12133.26s]  quizzes and tier lists and stuff. Maybe we'll do that on Wednesday.
[12135.58s -> 12141.78s]  You got to give me some good ones. Some ones that I haven't done. And maybe I would go back
[12141.78s -> 12151.75s]  and do one that I've done already because my opinions may have changed. Then the recommended
[12151.75s -> 12157.66s]  channel in the discord. An opportunity for you to say, you know, what you think would be a good one.
[12166.58s -> 12180.94s]  Garage. Somebody in here. Shit. Somebody is in here. All right. You need a what's wrong with it?
[12183.98s -> 12209.83s]  Scratch remover. What happened? Geez. Okay. What else? Need a new tire. I love that sound.
[12210.39s -> 12226.07s]  There's a werewolf attack. That's a lot of money. Wow. This is really worth doing too. Almost 200
[12226.07s -> 12251.58s]  bucks. Oh shit. I wasn't paying attention. I was bunny hopping. There we go. Expensive beer,
[12251.58s -> 12264.41s]  expensive booze. Thank you. What can I do for you? Yeah. How's it going? I feel like the actor
[12265.58s -> 12271.64s]  that, you know, I'm, yeah, I'm going to go do the, uh, I'm going to go be the clerk to get ready for
[12271.64s -> 12287.22s]  the role. Good morning, sir. How are you? Yeah. I'm going to do this for like a week. Maybe like
[12287.22s -> 12294.07s]  three days tops or maybe even possibly an hour. Yeah. I know I get, I get what it's like. Yeah.
[12300.60s -> 12330.86s]  Simpsons did that joke. Good. I'm glad. Simpsons family guy. 30. You have a lack of charging
[12330.86s -> 12339.13s]  ports at your station. And this is the part of the movie where like all the, all the country guys
[12339.13s -> 12346.47s]  look back and forth at each other sitting around and they all go, what are you talking about?
[12348.36s -> 12355.58s]  Charging port. Hey, are you going to go up in a spaceship? That's supposed to be a really funny
[12355.58s -> 12370.17s]  part of the movie. You're doing pond stars again. This is not pond stars. This is me running a gas
[12370.17s -> 12401.53s]  station. What? These cars are really small. The garage. I'll get, I'll get back to you.
[12401.53s -> 12415.93s]  Where's the garage? That's over here. Oh my God. Oh, mega laughing. What do you need? Quick to Larry
[12415.93s -> 12428.57s]  the cable guy impression. Okay. What do you, what do you need? That's just crazy. I'm just crazy.
[12428.57s -> 12440.50s]  Internet. Oh, mega laughing. All right. I need to, I need to stop doing that.
[12441.72s -> 12447.24s]  I'm like so energetic today. Why? Just relax. Like it's all right, man. Like what am I doing?
[12447.80s -> 12457.27s]  I'm just so excited. I don't know for nothing. I don't even know why. All right. What do you need?
[12458.07s -> 12464.81s]  Two tires and a mirror. Let's just relax. YouTuber Andy. I know. I've never, I've never,
[12464.81s -> 12493.03s]  it's the YouTuber in me. It's good to be excited. Yeah. That's fun. Over here. No umbrellas allowed.
[12493.43s -> 12503.62s]  Waiting room. Oh yeah. That's right. Oh, Oh no. You guys know the rule of the channel, right? How
[12503.62s -> 12516.09s]  this all works after a week of not playing the game. It's gone. Shit. Yeah. That's actually true.
[12516.09s -> 12538.36s]  That's actually true. You're honored. All right. I got plenty of money. It's time to start upgrading.
[12547.48s -> 12560.34s]  I'm coming. It's actually not true. What about the movies and house flipper?
[12561.30s -> 12568.65s]  I think some games do not qualify for that just because I love them so much.
[12569.69s -> 12596.63s]  30 bucks. Nice. Oh, is this place dirty? Okay. Nice and clean. Looks good. All right.
[12597.35s -> 12604.90s]  Now I've got 800 bucks. I need to gas station level three. Complete more objectives to be able
[12604.90s -> 12609.78s]  to upgrade the gas station. What are my objectives? Order car parts. Okay.
[12609.78s -> 12616.30s]  I'll order. Oh, these are expensive this week.
[12617.50s -> 12630.46s]  Order one of these and one of these. Okay. That's very expensive. Oh, it goes to the warehouse.
[12631.26s -> 12641.40s]  Are you gonna stream Elden Ring when it comes out? I would assume probably.
[12642.04s -> 12647.51s]  I don't see why not. I always play the new from software games on stream.
[12648.31s -> 12656.46s]  I just hope it's not as hard as Sekiro was. My gamer skill is on sort of a curve
[12657.75s -> 12666.49s]  where every six months now, I lose an extra step in my gamer skill. So I don't know. It's
[12666.49s -> 12690.30s]  gonna be tough. I did see the new gameplay trailer. You have games that you won't play
[12690.30s -> 12696.70s]  on stream because you want to enjoy them without 10,000 backseat gamers. I mean,
[12696.70s -> 12701.90s]  there is something to be said of playing something off stream for me just to kind of
[12702.78s -> 12708.86s]  do whatever, potentially just be awful at or to just keep my mouth open and sit there and not
[12708.86s -> 12779.62s]  say anything. All right. But no, those games are fun to stream. Customer. Oh, no. Refill
[12779.62s -> 12791.75s]  the shelves in the workshop with the car parts. Can I just do that? I feel like my favorite games
[12791.75s -> 12804.14s]  would be really bad ones to stream. Um, yeah, I mean, streaming for me has always sort of been
[12804.14s -> 12813.61s]  YouTube was like this too. I had the most fun when whoever was watching, whether it be on a live
[12813.61s -> 12819.96s]  broadcast or a video that I edited or whatever, that we would collectively think something was
[12819.96s -> 12825.40s]  fun or funny. Or, you know, something was interesting. So the prospect of just kind of
[12825.48s -> 12833.85s]  playing a game for me at this point is interesting to me on my own. But I think like on stream kind
[12833.85s -> 12839.05s]  of stuff, I have the most fun when I'm doing stuff like this. I'm just talking and just fucking
[12839.05s -> 12845.75s]  around. You guys are cracking jokes, cracking jokes. You know what I mean? I have the most
[12845.75s -> 12851.50s]  fun like this. Just hanging out fucking around or doing like a big project. That's where I have
[12851.50s -> 12867.67s]  the most fun. How many cops live here? A lot apparently. Well, I don't think this is,
[12867.67s -> 12873.75s]  from my understanding, this is a long sort of abandoned road. I don't know. I mean, I think
[12873.75s -> 12892.90s]  I'm like one of the only gas stations. This is ugly. This is a very ugly house. Oh, it was gray.
[12893.54s -> 12917.24s]  It's a yeehaw town. Why is this a different color? Light? What color is this? Remember the warehouse,
[12917.24s -> 12932.68s]  the warehouse? No, this is correct. You know, like, okay, I've never lived in an environment
[12933.48s -> 12943.53s]  where I just fell off the roof. I've never lived in an environment that was less like technology
[12944.09s -> 12949.45s]  and more kind of like just local stores and more like country. I feel like it would be kind of an
[12949.45s -> 12976.25s]  interesting experience. Close the warehouse. It's not. Rural, rural, rural, I can't say it,
[12976.25s -> 12984.97s]  rural, rural, rural life is, I missed everything you just said, Josh. Rural life is nice,
[12984.97s -> 12998.71s]  but you definitely lack access to a lot of stuff. That's the Seth MacFarlane dog sound.
[13001.46s -> 13004.66s]  Yeah, that's the Brian, Brian from Family Guy.
[13011.50s -> 13028.20s]  Yeah, it is. What do you need, Gap? Shut up about Family Guy. Shut up. All right,
[13028.20s -> 13030.60s]  can you take it? Okay. Can you tell that I'm clenching my teeth?
[13032.57s -> 13054.47s]  Idiot. It always sounds so, I don't know. It sounds so funny. My sister used to do that.
[13054.47s -> 13071.72s]  She would go, shut up, you idiot. That you could tell it would. Sister was mad. Dirty in here,
[13071.72s -> 13086.22s]  kind of. Are you saying we are the champions? No, I can't. My vocal range is gone. It's not high
[13086.22s -> 13093.98s]  anymore like it used to be. And I used to have a huge range. Now I can just make cash register
[13093.98s -> 13101.96s]  sounds and low baritone, yeah, noises. There's no range anymore. It's just one or the other.
[13117.05s -> 13124.89s]  All right, let me put, let me do this. I need to stock the shelves.
[13127.11s -> 13137.66s]  These tires. Place the mirrors and the scratch remover. What do you need?
[13138.22s -> 13155.46s]  Two tires and a mirror. You got it. This person's been in the garage for three hours.
[13156.18s -> 13168.54s]  Well, I'm working, I'm only one person. Are they going to add like a kitchen? Am I going to be a
[13168.54s -> 13191.37s]  chef? Your catering order just came in. Hurry up. They're waiting. All right, nice. I'm 1,200 bucks.
[13195.91s -> 13206.46s]  Okay, I need more fuel. I need, uh, I've got customers. Order some fuel. Complete all challenges
[13206.46s -> 13211.75s]  to be, all right, challenges. Cars fueled, shop customers served, and repair cars. All right,
[13211.75s -> 13227.35s]  so now we just have to kind of grind for a little bit. Read your emails. No, fuel. You got a bunch.
[13231.85s -> 13240.39s]  Oh, I need, okay, I need a snack variety. I need a snack variety. Snacks. What's some good shit?
[13241.90s -> 13249.88s]  These. People love these. And that's all I'm going to buy because I'm not buying the expensive ones.
[13250.76s -> 13260.26s]  Soft drinks. We got, uh, toffee, Aunt Betty's tonic, propicolo, and then, oh, ice cream.
[13261.98s -> 13268.97s]  Oh, hell yeah. And, uh, Betty's. Yeah, that sounds good. 208. Oh, yeah, yeah.
[13271.74s -> 13289.19s]  There we go. All right, whatever. Just need to serve customers, fuel up, and then I can upgrade
[13289.19s -> 13298.98s]  the, yeah, I'm supposed to go to the bathroom. Oh, hey, it's time. It's time for a BRB. It sure is.
[13299.62s -> 13374.01s]  Be right back. I haven't left yet. I'm listening to it. Imagine a BRB screen with like summer,
[13374.89s -> 13398.76s]  beach, tropical drinks, and shit. Oh, I do. Be right back for real. I haven't left yet again.
[13398.76s -> 13405.48s]  Uh, Lord, I was going to be making those. That's not just an idea. Right now, I'll be right back.
[13405.48s -> 13593.98s]  Good song. Great. This is a good song. Hello, I'm back. And let me give you a quick little
[13593.98s -> 13611.21s]  teaser of this one. Ooh. Imagine going BRB and hearing this. It's a little teaser.
[13611.77s -> 13659.13s]  It sounds like winter. Could be. What about a space BRB? Oh, that would be cool too. I mean,
[13659.13s -> 13674.90s]  I haven't even shown you the one that I think I'm going to use for fall. It could be this one. Or
[13675.83s -> 13694.87s]  you never know. Seasonal BRBs or yeah. I love this one. This one's awesome. You should have a BRB
[13694.87s -> 13702.31s]  random, like a gotcha. They could be rare BRB screens. Actually, that's kind of a cool idea.
[13712.66s -> 13715.30s]  All right. Well, I want to listen to the other ones. I'm sorry. That's what we're doing.
[13717.13s -> 13728.60s]  I want to hear the other ones. How about a 1% chance for a jump scare screen?
[13730.84s -> 13752.12s]  All right. How about this one? This one's good too. This is a pretty, this sounds like spring.
[13752.12s -> 13784.74s]  Yeah, it could be. Or winter. I can see it fit wintery as well. This one fits fall pretty well.
[13787.56s -> 13791.56s]  Yeah, we got, we got, we got blored out on retainer by the way. He's,
[13793.22s -> 13819.18s]  we make it much more of this stuff. We are entering a new highly pogged era of BRBs.
[13828.95s -> 13848.07s]  Yeah, this is spring. I love, I love this one. This one kind of reminds me, not this one,
[13848.07s -> 13858.36s]  the one I'll play, the one that I played in the very beginning. I don't want to cut this off
[13858.36s -> 13881.85s]  because this is equally as good. Are there any new BRB animations planned? Yes. Okay. So I have to,
[13882.81s -> 13885.77s]  they loop, but I have to loop them. I'm just kind of playing them.
[13886.73s -> 13892.28s]  This one reminds me of the intro and the outro. That same kind of vibe that like the drums that
[13892.28s -> 13901.24s]  go like, you know what I mean? I think this one might be my, this one could be my favorite.
[13902.04s -> 13935.86s]  This one has the same vibe as the intro and outro. I love it. I just want to listen to it like all
[13935.86s -> 13946.23s]  day. Who made these blored out, blored out. I'll support him. Did a hell of a job again.
[13947.03s -> 13954.44s]  And he's making more. The entire like soundtrack of this whole channel is just blored out
[13955.16s -> 13966.12s]  every time. Like I was saying earlier, this shit is, I would love to see a blored out
[13967.64s -> 13981.58s]  composed indie game. Wouldn't you? It'd be fucking incredible. Oh yeah. All right. I just want to
[13981.58s -> 13988.34s]  listen to it again. I don't think, blored out is probably not here. Blored out lives in Australia.
[13988.98s -> 13997.37s]  So not the best time for my stream to be live. So I don't know if they're watching stalling. Yeah.
[13997.37s -> 14009.03s]  I mean, this is a stall. You're right. Yeah. He's got a band camp. He's got a coffee.
[14010.71s -> 14016.76s]  Absolutely support them. By the way, those of you that probably didn't know this,
[14016.76s -> 14022.95s]  or maybe you did, this is some information for a lot of the newer viewers. Blored out was the one
[14022.95s -> 14031.30s]  that made all the music for the Jerma Rumble live action video. That was blored out. That was all
[14031.30s -> 14047.54s]  him. But that's another little tidbit. By the way, the B.S. song is probably the best thing
[14047.54s -> 14055.58s]  that he made on that. Stop. I'm trying to talk. When is the next live Jerma Rumble?
[14062.74s -> 14076.12s]  I mean, you know what I mean? I don't know. I don't know. You know what I mean?
[14092.95s -> 14099.30s]  Oh, I got it. Hold on. We've got a customer. Not tomorrow. What are you talking about?
[14105.22s -> 14117.22s]  Big if true. I. Hmm. Maybe we can talk about this. Maybe we should talk about this.
[14118.86s -> 14129.45s]  It's actually kind of personal. It's actually very personal. Yeah, why not?
[14129.45s -> 14140.94s]  Why not? We're just hanging out. We're just chilling. So I want before I am done streaming
[14141.74s -> 14150.65s]  and kind of doing the whole content creator thing, I want to have an absolute blowout show,
[14153.99s -> 14163.50s]  absolutely monumental show. And one of the things I really want to do
[14165.77s -> 14170.57s]  is like and like this is not spoilers or anything because it's so there's so much shit written down
[14170.57s -> 14177.86s]  for this. I really want to do like a Jerma Rumble live on Twitch and have it be a fucking monumental
[14178.97s -> 14187.03s]  magnum opus type show. So obviously that's not happening anytime in the near future,
[14188.86s -> 14196.38s]  but just know that that's going to be that's going to be as insane as I can possibly make it.
[14196.38s -> 14207.40s]  Whatever I can do to make it happen. Define the near future. I don't know if I could even
[14207.40s -> 14223.61s]  answer that. I really don't think so. But the plan is to essentially have an experience that
[14223.61s -> 14228.01s]  might last more than a day or two, maybe longer, maybe one event. I don't know,
[14228.01s -> 14241.98s]  but I want it to be huge. And we're talking like, I don't want to okay, I don't want to
[14241.98s -> 14247.19s]  talk about something that's not happening in the very near future. Are you going to retire soon?
[14249.05s -> 14258.41s]  No, it really no. It depends on what your definition of soon is, I think. Because
[14261.13s -> 14268.82s]  my definition of soon is probably different than yours. I will tell you right now there's no plan
[14268.82s -> 14276.04s]  on that for at least the next couple of years, at least. So don't worry, I'm not like leaving
[14276.04s -> 14280.76s]  next week or anything. There's no plan for me to even start thinking about that for at least
[14280.76s -> 14289.59s]  another few years. But when it does happen, and look, I have to be realistic too, right? I mean,
[14289.59s -> 14297.94s]  I feel like I try to be pretty realistic with everybody here. Whenever we talk real, I know
[14297.94s -> 14304.84s]  that I can't really do this forever. And I said a long time ago that I was going to do it and have
[14304.84s -> 14307.88s]  as much of a good of a time as I can and try to do the best job that I can,
[14308.84s -> 14328.33s]  as long as I'm having a good time. So I can't really tell you when. Quitting in 2025.
[14330.73s -> 14336.62s]  I don't know. I can't tell you that. I don't want it to be inaccurate with what I mean by this.
[14338.71s -> 14351.62s]  You're not allowed to stop. What do you mean you don't know? No, I don't want to talk too much
[14351.62s -> 14361.51s]  about it. But you guys have to remember, I'll be 40 pretty soon here. I'm having a real talk with
[14361.51s -> 14376.71s]  my chat room, okay? Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? Fan for life. Sweep that
[14376.71s -> 14387.48s]  asshole. No, but I want to be realistic with you guys too. Is it delivery here? Oh, level up.
[14387.48s -> 14423.54s]  What do I get? 40 isn't that... I know 40 is not old. Elon Musk. Awesome. And I want to make it
[14423.54s -> 14427.38s]  clear too that if I do at some point end up saying, you know what? It's probably time for me to
[14428.34s -> 14437.54s]  put up the... What's the term? Hang up the towel? Hang up the gloves? What do you want to say?
[14439.59s -> 14446.17s]  You guys would know very, very well in advance. This is not something that is going to just be
[14446.17s -> 14451.90s]  like, well, you know what? I'm not coming back ever again. Bye. See you later. I would probably
[14451.90s -> 14459.10s]  announce something like that. Kind of transitioning out of YouTube and Twitch stuff. Probably at
[14459.10s -> 14462.78s]  least a year in advance. I would want you guys to know because I don't want... Here's another thing
[14462.78s -> 14473.06s]  too. Stop talking. Another thing what I don't want to have happen is let's say that, you know,
[14473.70s -> 14478.50s]  years from now, whenever it is, I decide that's probably it. We've had a great time. It was really
[14478.50s -> 14484.52s]  fun. And then maybe we'll do a few big like kind of blow up shows, right? I don't want people to
[14484.52s -> 14492.84s]  like sub to the channel and like I just leave. I would want it to be really clear. Like, hey,
[14492.92s -> 14502.50s]  everybody at some point, like over this next year, this is going to be it. Don't be sad. It's not
[14502.50s -> 14509.82s]  happening yet. You can't... Don't be sad yet. Don't be sad at all. It's not happening. It's
[14509.82s -> 14522.62s]  not happening for a very long time. It's been something that's not necessarily been on my mind,
[14522.62s -> 14530.98s]  but something that we've really never talked about is... And I've been doing this for a long time.
[14533.22s -> 14541.18s]  And my 10 year content creator, in quotes, anniversary, right? I mean, there are TV shows
[14541.18s -> 14558.54s]  that don't last this long. There are things that... It's shocking. Don't hit them. Again,
[14558.54s -> 14565.02s]  this is not happening in the near future. This is happening like at least years from now.
[14565.02s -> 14574.31s]  At least years from now, okay? So don't worry. And then no more... I thought I had to deliver... Oh,
[14574.31s -> 14582.39s]  I didn't... Oh, shit. The delivery guy. He's been here for two days. He's been out here for a full
[14582.39s -> 14612.44s]  two days. Sorry. That was an angry honk. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. And there's other ventures that
[14612.44s -> 14621.27s]  I think I want to do. You know, maybe I want to start producing some shows. Not being necessarily
[14621.27s -> 14625.91s]  in front of the camera, right? But maybe to help with creators making stuff for...
[14627.88s -> 14631.96s]  Open up a fucking animal sanctuary or something somewhere. You know, I don't know. There's like
[14631.96s -> 14636.31s]  a new chapter of the thing that I want to do. I just don't really know exactly what it is.
[14637.03s -> 14659.67s]  What about president? You know, I think I could probably do a pretty good job. I think so.
[14660.31s -> 14672.12s]  And look at how I'm running this place. Okay, we're good. I gotta close this.
[14672.52s -> 14685.85s]  Okay, we can move on from that conversation. It's just I want to do over these next at least
[14685.85s -> 14693.86s]  couple of years, I really kind of want to do some big fun stuff. The dollhouse was sort of,
[14693.86s -> 14700.55s]  and like the archaeology stream, those were sort of precursors to what I want to do,
[14700.55s -> 14706.49s]  at least for the next few years. If they can happen, then I'm going to try to do them.
[14706.49s -> 14711.53s]  I'm going to try to do for it. Do for it. Go for it. Baseball stream is coming up too. That's
[14711.53s -> 14716.09s]  another one that is. Yeah, I think there's gonna be a lot of opportunity for fun.
[14719.16s -> 14744.17s]  The person leave immediately because it smells in here. You got so mad at Nicktoons baseball,
[14744.17s -> 14759.53s]  I'm afraid for real baseball. That's different though. Okay, we're almost halfway there. I want
[14759.53s -> 14776.90s]  to see what happens at level four. You wouldn't be able to hold down a real job. Yeah, you're
[14776.90s -> 14784.52s]  right. I'm never going to stop streaming. I can't do anything else. Actually, I mean,
[14786.01s -> 14793.67s]  actually, potentially accurate though. I mean, I'm not a fool to know, you know, things that I
[14793.67s -> 14800.52s]  think I would like to do. I don't know if I disagree with that statement, but there's other
[14800.52s -> 14815.45s]  things I want to try. A clown? That would actually be kind of fun. Oh, parking lot upgrade. That's
[14815.45s -> 14844.98s]  right. I need to clear this. I gotta clear this crap. It's not like we wouldn't be there to throw
[14844.98s -> 14854.31s]  money at you if you came back to streaming. Yeah, but that's not, that's not, I wouldn't want you
[14854.31s -> 14872.22s]  to do that. Where is, where the hell is my excavator? If you got a regular job, you'd be
[14872.22s -> 14881.62s]  hounded nonstop because of who, not very many people know who I am. If I went to go work
[14881.62s -> 14885.38s]  somewhere, it's not like I would, I'm not like a celebrity that opens the door and it's like,
[14885.38s -> 14891.22s]  oh my God, it's Gerber. Oh my God, it's Gerber 95. No, I, most people don't know who I am.
[14892.10s -> 14924.84s]  I'm gonna take two or three trips. Literally everyone here knows you. Yeah, but that, this is
[14924.84s -> 14939.22s]  a, in the grand scheme of the human population. Yeah. I know we don't get real that often here.
[14939.94s -> 14943.14s]  They just mainly fuck around and stuff, but sometimes it's important to talk about this
[14943.14s -> 14960.74s]  kind of stuff. That many people know you passively. Yeah, but they don't know who I am.
[14960.90s -> 14966.66s]  Sure. Somebody might've seen the like 50,000 upvoted thing on Reddit of me being the AI
[14966.66s -> 14971.62s]  serial killer image, but that they just think that that's a real image of a serial killer,
[14971.62s -> 14981.85s]  right? They don't think that's me. In fact, if somebody saw me that saw that picture,
[14982.73s -> 14989.56s]  they would probably have a double-take and go, holy shit. That guy looks just like the serial
[14989.56s -> 14996.26s]  killer. So yeah, I would get recognized as the serial killer, not German 985. Just kind of
[14996.26s -> 15009.18s]  interesting. Hey, I just, sorry to bother you. Are you the serial killer guy? That's me. Yep.
[15010.15s -> 15015.99s]  Whoa. Dude, how does it feel to know that you look like every serial killer? That must be so
[15015.99s -> 15041.38s]  fucked up. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's crazy. Wow. The garage. Ooh, we got, damn, that's crazy.
[15042.66s -> 15050.25s]  The exit conversation as soon as possible. Statement. You get a bad door.
[15060.23s -> 15068.31s]  Like what the fuck? Holy shit, man. That's crazy. You can use all these if you want.
[15068.31s -> 15088.22s]  Oh, we don't need more than one tire ratio. You fell off. I don't even know what that means.
[15088.86s -> 15096.34s]  I've done this. I don't. You have two broken tires. Shit. All right. We'll stay here.
[15096.34s -> 15111.51s]  Stay here. I'll, I got to order your parts. Band Twitter users.
[15121.62s -> 15131.10s]  I've been watching you for a month and you're already my father.
[15132.06s -> 15142.70s]  What are you talking about? That just, I was not prepared for that one.
[15146.46s -> 15150.06s]  I thought you were saying like favorite, like, oh, wow. Thanks. I appreciate that.
[15150.86s -> 15161.24s]  No, I'm apparently your father. All right. I need to, I got to get deliveries. These are expensive
[15161.24s -> 15177.37s]  today. Whatever. How much is this? Too much money. $885. Give me a break. What's so expensive?
[15180.20s -> 15187.67s]  The anti-scratch. I'm just going to buy the tires. They're so expensive. Whatever.
[15197.18s -> 15202.15s]  Dad's leaving for cigarettes again. Nope. I'm not going to have to do that for a long time.
[15214.65s -> 15227.61s]  Goku. Oh, I keep forgetting to restock these stupid shelves. All we have is Pringles,
[15228.65s -> 15240.66s]  but there's sour cream. Those are the best. If you only have sour cream and onion Pringles,
[15241.85s -> 15263.37s]  that's fine. Finally, what about pizza Pringles? Um, I would probably rather have sour cream and
[15263.37s -> 15274.20s]  onion. Salt and vinegar are based. They kind of burn the edges of my mouth. I get that kind of
[15275.08s -> 15293.58s]  almost like irritation on the corners of my mouth. I think they taste all right. What even is this?
[15296.18s -> 15303.70s]  Oh, it's the car parts. Right. All right. See you later, man. Yep. Yep. That's how we know. Hey,
[15303.70s -> 15307.54s]  that's how we know the business time for you to leave. Take care. See you later, man. See you
[15307.54s -> 15331.29s]  next time. Oh, I bet you they do shit like that. I can't get going. Take off and it's like, oh,
[15331.29s -> 15348.42s]  what the fuck, Gary? Fucking dick. When's the last time you cried?
[15362.87s -> 15367.43s]  There's some real, there's some real bangers coming in the last 20 minutes or so here, guys.
[15368.76s -> 15372.89s]  There's some real good comments coming in. These are awesome.
[15373.05s -> 15385.11s]  Um, it's a fair question. How is, how is it a fair question? Oh, no, I know what it was. It was
[15385.11s -> 15390.50s]  Ernest scared stupid at the very end when he like doesn't have any friends. He's sitting there with
[15390.50s -> 15392.98s]  it sad because like he doesn't have any friends that want to like hang out with him and like he
[15392.98s -> 15415.10s]  saved the day. Yeah. I was fucking started crying. It was a week ago. Hey, don't just yeah. Like
[15415.10s -> 15424.07s]  Ernest saves the day and his dog, his doggy thinks is gone because well, I don't want to spoil the
[15424.07s -> 15431.96s]  movie. It's a fucking classic. Every Ernest movie is a classic. By the way, you want to talk about
[15431.96s -> 15441.40s]  like comedy influences on me in this channel. Ernest is one of them, has to be. Jim Varney,
[15441.40s -> 15460.46s]  the garage fuck. Ernest made like 15 movies or something. He had a bunch of commercials. He
[15460.46s -> 15485.38s]  was had a bunch of movies. I loved Ernest when I was younger. He did Shakespeare. Yeah. He had such
[15485.94s -> 15490.66s]  animated. Okay. You know, like Jim Carrey, the way that Jim Carrey kind of moves and talks.
[15492.26s -> 15500.87s]  Jim Varney in his comedic performances was like another Jim Carrey type, really animated movements.
[15501.69s -> 15506.17s]  He was super, super funny with his body and his like face and stuff. It was hilarious. He was,
[15506.17s -> 15515.74s]  he was a great like physical comedian and not like, you know, when people do like that physical kind
[15515.74s -> 15519.50s]  of exaggerated stuff and it comes off, you have to be like the right kind of person to do it.
[15520.46s -> 15530.78s]  Right. Those are huge influences, especially Jim Varney and Jim, two Jims, Jim Carrey, Jim Varney.
[15542.06s -> 15565.66s]  He was also the original Slinky the dog in Toy Story. He didn't know. It's dirty in here. Almost
[15565.66s -> 15578.81s]  at the place where I can upgrade original, like just Toy Story one, none of the sequels.
[15579.45s -> 15587.10s]  Cause I believe, correct me if I'm wrong. I believe after Toy Story, I think he, he, he died
[15587.10s -> 15591.02s]  after Toy Story, right? That was his one of his last roles. I remember that was one of his last
[15591.02s -> 15609.50s]  things he did. Oh, I can do the parking lot. I like kind of think back at like, so Jim Henson
[15609.50s -> 15622.92s]  is another one. Oh my God. It's only Jims. I'm having kind of a moment here. Jim Henson,
[15622.92s -> 15640.76s]  Jim Varney, Jim Carrey. Anybody else? Jimmy Neutron. Oh, hey, hey Jimmy. Oh, hey Jimbo.
[15648.55s -> 15663.83s]  I'm not Jim Gaffigan. Um, but yeah, I think I was probably a little too young to necessarily
[15663.83s -> 15670.34s]  understand when Jim Henson, Jim Henson, when did Jim Henson die? Somewhere in like the early 90s,
[15670.34s -> 15682.07s]  late 80s. I forget what it was, but man, I just can't even imagine, um, how much more awesome
[15682.07s -> 15687.75s]  stuff that he probably would have done. And it kind of makes me think too about like our kind of
[15687.75s -> 15694.73s]  kids content and stuff that's for children nowadays. I feel like we need some better stuff
[15694.73s -> 15702.89s]  for kids. I really believe that all the stuff that Jim Henson was doing back in like the Muppets and
[15702.89s -> 15706.01s]  like stuff like the old Sesame streets and stuff. I feel like there needs to be some more
[15707.14s -> 15713.21s]  stuff that kind of taps into kids' imaginations and taps into kids, um, more creative thinking
[15713.21s -> 15723.22s]  and stuff. Like there's a lot, it's an untapped market right now. When I was younger, I remember
[15724.10s -> 15728.42s]  I feel like a lot of my personality and how I see things were developed from
[15729.22s -> 15734.26s]  watching stuff like Sesame street and what's going on? Did he just get pulled over?
[15737.78s -> 15749.67s]  Why did he get pulled over? Oh my god. Oh, the parking lot. I gotta let this guy out. Okay.
[15757.14s -> 15780.70s]  All right. You can leave. Do not release. What's your opinion on almond and oat milk? Uh,
[15780.70s -> 15788.74s]  used to be almond milk Andy. Now I'm an oat milk enjoyer. I actually like oat milk a lot.
[15795.64s -> 15814.02s]  Parking lot. Come on. Where is it? Here we go. Have you ever tried potato milk? No.
[15814.74s -> 15828.39s]  Didn't even know it existed. That's why I even asked that, man. Why ask that? What the fuck?
[15829.11s -> 15832.39s]  I'm not even, whatever. We're just going to keep, we're going to move on.
[15837.05s -> 15843.53s]  Uh, potato milk. I don't, I've never had it. I probably would be, I don't really like rice
[15843.53s -> 15849.93s]  milk though. I don't like rice milk. I don't like soy milk. I drank almond milk and put it in my
[15849.93s -> 15855.03s]  coffee and everything for the longest time. Raspi voice Andy. Here I am. Here I am. It's me.
[15857.46s -> 15860.50s]  Oat milk and almond milk are the ones that I find or taste the best.
[15864.34s -> 15869.62s]  Rice milk is too runny for me. It's too thin. It's like water. Water. Uh, rice milk is too watery.
[15870.71s -> 15876.31s]  Oat milk has that, that thickness and that sort of viscous-ness to it that I like.
[15880.42s -> 15888.52s]  How about Mountain Dew? I don't think I've, I've not, I don't think I've had a sip of Mountain Dew
[15888.52s -> 15902.65s]  in like eight years. Good though. I would probably drink it if it gave to me right now. 17 to 25.
[15902.65s -> 15918.02s]  All right. One more car and then I can worry about the, somebody's already here. What about
[15918.02s -> 15929.14s]  a refreshing Capri Sun? Yeah, Capri Suns are awesome. Although I like Capri Suns until I see
[15929.14s -> 15934.73s]  the liquid out of the pouch. Something really odd about the way it looks, right? It seems odd.
[15936.94s -> 15942.38s]  The mystery of the Capri Sun being inside the pouch is like, I don't care. It could literally,
[15942.38s -> 15948.76s]  the liquid could be like dark brown and I wouldn't even care or know, but it's sort of like a,
[15949.56s -> 15953.80s]  it's like a transparent, like it's almost like a pink, isn't it? Or like a light blue,
[15953.80s -> 15962.09s]  like it's like water, but it's like pink or blue. Yeah, it's slightly pink. I don't think about
[15962.09s -> 15985.11s]  that. I don't want to take it out of the pouch. Why would you? I don't know. Because when you're like
[15986.34s -> 15992.17s]  12 years old, do you think it's funny to stick the thing and pour it out? Like squeeze it out
[15992.17s -> 15999.50s]  into a cup and then drink it? Because I used to stay in the bathroom for like an hour
[16000.14s -> 16008.31s]  and make magic potions with shampoo, toothpaste, mouthwash. I would do this kind of stuff.
[16014.12s -> 16027.56s]  Oh, there goes the combo. That's not good. You botched it. What did the potions do?
[16032.74s -> 16038.92s]  All right. I don't know, but, but okay. Is this weird? This might sound a little weird,
[16039.72s -> 16046.09s]  but it was an excuse to like not go to the bathroom. I could just sit here and then hold
[16046.09s -> 16052.50s]  by like, and I, it was like, it was, it was enjoyable for me to like sit there and like
[16052.50s -> 16058.04s]  make the potions and not go. I don't want to go to the bathroom. No. I was like a little kid.
[16059.53s -> 16065.21s]  I'm making potions right now, mom. I'm busy. And it's like, no, get, go to the bathroom.
[16070.41s -> 16074.57s]  And like, if you go into go like number two, it was an excuse for me to make potions.
[16075.70s -> 16078.82s]  Oh, I can do this. And like, nobody's going to come in. I could make magic potions.
[16079.38s -> 16094.47s]  Because when you're in the bathroom, obviously like the doors closed, no one's like coming in.
[16095.67s -> 16099.19s]  So it was like, I could make potions and like, oh yeah, I'm in the bathroom.
[16099.99s -> 16114.39s]  Give me the shampoo and give me the mouthwash. All right. Only a few more customers.
[16115.82s -> 16125.62s]  Getting robbed. What? What the fuck? What happened? We're just like,
[16125.62s -> 16150.01s]  it was stink bomb in here. Oh, it's that kid. Where is he? Is that him? I should kind of like
[16150.01s -> 16160.10s]  that. It's staying a lesson in beating the haters. This looks really good. I'm going to keep it.
[16163.13s -> 16169.51s]  I think it looks awesome. Actually not changing it back. That has to go though.
[16169.67s -> 16195.77s]  Okay. That has to go. That one does passive aggressive, Karen. I, all right. There's only
[16195.77s -> 16227.22s]  two. There's two more here. Mr. Albertson, you have emails. I, I know I'll get to them.
[16227.22s -> 16232.71s]  I'll get to them. No worries. One more customer and I will go close the doors.
[16241.10s -> 16256.18s]  Sweep your floors. I'm going to go feral. One person can only do so much. I'm sorry. I can't.
[16268.14s -> 16280.33s]  All right. There we go. I need to repair cars. You can hire people. Really? I need to close this
[16282.87s -> 16287.59s]  fucking garage Albertson. I'm, hold on. Nobody took anything. We're fine.
[16293.62s -> 16303.72s]  Heal is low. Yeah. I'll get a couple of deliveries here. Make that little shit head work for you.
[16307.37s -> 16310.57s]  I, we need, I need car parts. They're good. They're cheap today.
[16312.38s -> 16317.18s]  Pour those. Get some of these. I need a couple more of these. Oh, that's going to be expensive.
[16317.34s -> 16333.24s]  Okay. I need to, what smell? Well, don't throw like a fucking three day old, like
[16334.38s -> 16351.78s]  Thanksgiving dinner in here, whatever you did. I don't know. Oh, Thanksgiving dinner,
[16354.57s -> 16362.47s]  stuffing, cranberry sauce. Wait, I would like a poll to be made. This is going to determine
[16362.47s -> 16367.91s]  how many people get banned from the channel. If you vote for the thing that I say that I,
[16367.91s -> 16373.62s]  if you vote for one of these that I don't like timed out for 10 minutes, I would like for you
[16373.62s -> 16381.61s]  to do a poll. Whoever is available in the chat, do a poll or do you prefer the canned
[16381.61s -> 16388.39s]  cranberry jelly sauce? Like the can in the can, the jelly shit or fresh cranberry sauce.
[16389.43s -> 16410.81s]  I need to know cranberry sauce or the cranberry can. I need to know. I'm not American. Well,
[16410.81s -> 16420.62s]  this is what you have to be American to eat cranberries. That American thing. Who is he
[16420.62s -> 16429.74s]  talking to? Laugh out loud. You. It's looking, it's not crazy, but you know what I love doing.
[16429.74s -> 16435.37s]  I'm a cranberry fiend. I go. All right. I'm going to gross out everybody here. Are you ready to
[16435.37s -> 16440.65s]  fucking hate me? Everyone's going to hate my guts after this one. Um, I like to buy
[16442.66s -> 16451.30s]  the not concentrated, not diluted, 100% cranberry juice, not concentrate. This is the real shit.
[16451.38s -> 16462.76s]  And I drink that shit. It hurts. It's painful. You did like the citric or malic, whatever acid
[16462.76s -> 16468.23s]  that builds up on the back of your tongue. It hurts. It's brutal, but I like it some. I don't
[16468.23s -> 16472.07s]  know why you can't drink too much of that though. You can only have like a little bit of that. It's
[16472.07s -> 16477.46s]  way too acidic. What you guys don't know is that when you buy cranberry juice off the shelf,
[16477.46s -> 16483.14s]  Oh, cranberry juice cocktail. When you think of cranberry juice, I'll take a cranberry juice.
[16483.14s -> 16487.62s]  You're drinking like 13% cranberry juice and then like water and sugar.
[16487.62s -> 16503.24s]  You're not drinking the real shit. What you guys don't know is
[16509.50s -> 16514.94s]  you just called me out. I know. I see what you guys don't know is that's not real cranberry juice.
[16514.94s -> 16518.38s]  It's cranberry cocktail. I'm so much smarter than you and I'm better than you and I'm more
[16518.38s -> 16535.83s]  healthy than you. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Look, I know. I'm sorry, but it's, I know it's a little weird.
[16536.47s -> 16543.54s]  I like to drink a hundred percent, not from concentrate cranberry juice in small amounts.
[16544.18s -> 16553.27s]  Oh dude. Yeah. I don't want too much of that. It's too harsh. Did we even do a poll? Oh, we did.
[16553.27s -> 16566.20s]  Okay. What do you got? Okay. So it turns out that 57% of you, 57, 58% of you are in complete
[16566.20s -> 16571.82s]  agreeance with all the other idiots that think that fresh cranberry sauce is better than the
[16571.82s -> 16593.83s]  canned stuff. Canned stuff is way better. I prefer the canned stuff. I do time them out,
[16593.83s -> 16599.27s]  time them out. You can't time out like what's, what's 60% of how many people are even here?
[16599.27s -> 16607.85s]  You can't time out 8,000 people. I don't think we can even do that. I don't think it's even
[16607.85s -> 16620.30s]  possible. Uh, no, all jokes aside, I do prefer the canned stuff. Easier to work with. You can
[16620.30s -> 16625.58s]  grab a knife and kind of just grab a little slab of it and put it right on the turkey and it sticks.
[16626.22s -> 16631.03s]  The sauce gets everywhere. It doesn't stay on the turkey. It doesn't become part of the bite.
[16631.03s -> 16650.06s]  It becomes a sauce. Omega laughing. You know what else I really like? We're just, we're just,
[16651.06s -> 16658.65s]  we're just hanging out. Um, you guys ever have red pepper jelly on top of, you take the red
[16658.65s -> 16665.61s]  pepper jelly out and you pour it over a slab of just Philadelphia cream cheese, just the plain
[16665.61s -> 16672.50s]  Philadelphia cream cheese, grab some like wheat thins or crackers and you just kind of smear down
[16672.50s -> 16676.84s]  and grab a little bit of the jelly and a little bit of the cream cheese brick. If you've not done
[16676.84s -> 16687.50s]  that before, I assure you, if you do it, you're going to understand. It's very good. It's
[16687.50s -> 16694.22s]  unbelievable. Red pepper jelly goes great on a lot of stuff. I need to eat more jelly.
[16694.78s -> 16705.29s]  I love this stuff. You don't eat the whole thing on your own. You put it out as like an appetizer.
[16705.29s -> 16711.18s]  You want to kill it at an appetizer? I'll tell you if, listen to me, you bring the red pepper
[16711.18s -> 16715.50s]  jelly and the Philadelphia cream cheese and you make that. It's so easy. People are going to think
[16715.50s -> 16721.80s]  you're a genius and you can use it. Be like, ah, it's like my little secret recipe. Like you don't
[16721.80s -> 16727.02s]  even tell them that you got it for me. You take this. It's yours. You take the credit for this.
[16731.16s -> 16736.20s]  Baked brie and strawberry jam. That's leveling up a little bit. I think because that requires
[16736.20s -> 16743.27s]  actually baking. You don't have to do anything. You buy the little brick of Philadelphia plain
[16743.27s -> 16749.59s]  cream cheese, open it out of its package from the fridge and just pour the red pepper jelly on top
[16749.59s -> 16753.91s]  and then take some crackers of some wheat thins and just put it out on the table.
[16753.91s -> 16762.52s]  You don't have to do anything. Well, you also have to make sure that people like red pepper
[16762.52s -> 16773.69s]  kind of jelly. It's not hot, but it kind of is. Derma, a millionaire eats pepper jelly on cream
[16773.69s -> 16794.10s]  cheese. It's good. It doesn't, there's nothing to do with, what are you talking about? It does have
[16794.10s -> 16800.82s]  a bit of a kick. Yeah, it does. That's the, what do you mean? That's like, you've got mail. I know
[16800.82s -> 16823.34s]  I've got mail. I have to repair cars. Don't let them shame you. No, I know. Hub cream cheese is
[16823.34s -> 16830.26s]  better than brick cream cheese. Um, I mean, that's a debate, but for this particular purpose, you need
[16830.26s -> 16835.78s]  the brick because you have to push a cracker through it and it sits out on the table nice.
[16835.78s -> 16846.65s]  So you can kind of go through the jelly and into the cream cheese. All right. Forget about the,
[16846.65s -> 16853.37s]  I need to do the garage. Is anybody in there? All right. Somebody just got in. You can wait like
[16853.37s -> 16871.58s]  four days. It's fine. Oh shit. I have no more fuel. Oh shit. Any kind of jam and cream cheese is good.
[16873.16s -> 16876.44s]  I haven't really had that much experience with it besides the red pepper one.
[16877.08s -> 16901.35s]  He's spending all of his money on NFTs. I'm not. Yeah, the kudri boards. Oh yeah.
[16904.55s -> 16910.15s]  That fig jam. You get fig jam on a kudri board. What? It's not even dirty in here. Disgusting.
[16910.87s -> 16924.34s]  What are they talking about? Oh shit. Okay. I need to restock. I need the ice cream freezer.
[16935.03s -> 16940.41s]  When are you going to make a sus face NFT? That's not going to, I'm not doing that.
[16941.85s -> 16944.65s]  Oh, out of fuel completely. People are pissed. Oh, I'm sorry.
[16951.38s -> 16954.74s]  Uh, um, um, um, um, I need products. No, I need gas.
[16955.46s -> 17003.94s]  I'm going this way. Tread carefully here. What do you mean about NFTs? I could give you a small
[17003.94s -> 17011.26s]  opinion on it. Not really a major one, but I think that over the next five to 10 years, I really hope
[17011.26s -> 17016.23s]  that if that's something that's going to stick around, that some of the new technologies in
[17016.23s -> 17021.72s]  like the crypto space makes them a lot more efficient if they're actually going to be around,
[17021.72s -> 17026.31s]  which they might not. Um, cause I was obviously at the current state right now.
[17027.03s -> 17047.22s]  I could use a little bit more efficiency and maybe a little more green. Where, what's, what's
[17047.22s -> 17062.68s]  going on? Get off me. Are these all my tires? All right. What is it? Is that it? What is it?
[17062.68s -> 17068.86s]  What does he need? Oh, it needs a second mirror. Shit. It's an interesting concept,
[17068.86s -> 17073.86s]  but I wish it wasn't ruining the environment. Yeah. Well, that's another thing to remember too,
[17073.86s -> 17081.13s]  is that when people think of like blockchain, right? Stuff like Bitcoin, stuff like Ethereum,
[17082.38s -> 17090.65s]  you know, I, there's like proof of work, proof of stake, but hopefully potentially over the years,
[17091.61s -> 17096.33s]  those become way, way more efficient where they don't need to do that much and generate that much
[17096.33s -> 17103.90s]  electricity. I really hope so. I think there's a lot of people that are trying to solve that problem
[17103.90s -> 17120.70s]  at the moment. I can't say that I, oh fuck, I gave him no gas. He got zero gas. And I also have to be
[17120.70s -> 17130.46s]  completely honest here too. I don't really even know that much about them. I know about like
[17130.46s -> 17135.50s]  cryptographic technology, right? And like cryptocurrency, but NFTs are kind of,
[17135.50s -> 17145.83s]  I'm kind of a boomer with that shit. So it's hard to immediately speak about it. Oh my God,
[17145.83s -> 17173.11s]  this is a long line. I've been in the line for days, but if you want to hear the optimist in me,
[17173.11s -> 17177.67s]  right? I hope that some of these new technologies, some of these new things people are making can be
[17177.67s -> 17195.16s]  made and done and used in, you know, kind of proper ways. I mean, I, look, I got to be honest
[17195.16s -> 17201.78s]  with everybody here. I'm not going to try to, you know, pretend like I don't speak of a certain
[17201.78s -> 17208.89s]  topic. I used to have an Ethereum address that you could donate to on this stream. It was there.
[17209.94s -> 17215.30s]  Like I, it was, I was like, Hey, Oh dude, come on, give me some Ethereum. This is like 2015 or
[17215.30s -> 17225.21s]  something 2016, right? I think as these networks grow and more and more and more and more and more
[17225.21s -> 17229.45s]  people are using them and we need more and more and more like, like mining farms, right?
[17230.09s -> 17236.30s]  They're trying to come up with solutions to that. And I can speak personally that I,
[17236.30s -> 17246.97s]  I hope they do. I hope they can actually come up with a solution because I think this, I think
[17246.97s -> 17253.78s]  it's a really interesting technology. I do for many different reasons, but if it has to be,
[17253.78s -> 17260.44s]  it has to be done right, right? Getting a raid. What's going on? Oh, good. Perfect. Change the
[17260.44s -> 17271.58s]  subject. Whew. Hey, big raid. I forget about all that shit. I was just saying. Connor Reads Pants.
[17271.58s -> 17287.29s]  Thanks for the raid. What's up, Connor? Welcome guys. How are you? Good to see you. Thanks for
[17287.29s -> 17302.90s]  the raid. Hope you had a good stream, Connor. We're playing gas station simulator. Raid song,
[17302.90s -> 17309.54s]  please. There is no raid song. It hasn't happened since like 2019. Stop. There's no meme anymore.
[17309.54s -> 17326.23s]  The meme is gone. See? Yeah. You're talking about a season three. No, no, no. That's like
[17326.23s -> 17332.89s]  season five, season six meme. We're in like season. No, are we in season 10, season 11?
[17333.69s -> 17346.25s]  That's like a season eight meme. Yeah. I'm sorry. You guys are talking about like,
[17346.25s -> 17352.17s]  you guys talking about when, uh, when Dale dropped the chili. Um, no, sorry. We're like,
[17352.17s -> 17356.65s]  Jeff and Pam had a baby. We're like, that's where we are. So I know like you thought that was funny,
[17356.65s -> 17371.43s]  like back then, but we're in, we're on the new season here. I've not watched more than one
[17371.43s -> 17388.44s]  episode of the office. I've only seen, I think 20 minutes of one episode. Somebody, oh, there's
[17388.44s -> 17401.96s]  nothing on the shelves to buy. Somebody buy something. I need more alcohol. Wait, what do
[17401.96s -> 17425.24s]  you need? Hmm. Everybody keeps busting out their mirrors here. What's going on? Remember that
[17425.24s -> 17429.00s]  office crack was actually really funny. The way you got the names wrong. Thank you for saying that.
[17429.16s -> 17434.42s]  Okay. Come on. We're talking comedy here.
[17436.98s -> 17448.44s]  We're talking comedy. We're talking comedian. Like me, you know, I need one more car and that's it.
[17449.08s -> 17462.18s]  Do you think this is worth buying? Um, it's kind of a fun, just busy work game. I think it's pretty
[17462.18s -> 17480.63s]  fun. How much is this game? Does anyone, anyone know how much this is? 20 bucks. Yeah. 20 bucks.
[17481.35s -> 17501.24s]  Yeah, I think so. Full of trash. Oh, the smell is horrible.
[17505.42s -> 17527.16s]  All right. Check the email for God's sakes. Off my screen. All right. How are we doing? Didn't read
[17527.16s -> 17537.10s]  them. No, I marked everything as red and closed my computer laptop hard and angry. One more car
[17537.10s -> 17551.26s]  going in. Whoa. You've been robbed. Somebody took, what'd you take? Took two gallons of milk.
[17551.98s -> 17576.49s]  Oh shit. I need to repair a car. Oh, by the way, to all the Raiders, take a look at this.
[17581.77s -> 17617.05s]  Remember that one? They're all, they're already all gone. I don't think all of them are gone.
[17617.05s -> 17622.92s]  Cigarettes are a big seller. I almost have to restock them. Can you beatbox please? Yeah.
[17632.42s -> 17663.83s]  You got a lot of stuff. No. Where's the beer? It's a popular place now. There we go. All right.
[17663.83s -> 17693.54s]  Finally. What can I do for you? Tire. Lucky for you, I have one more tire. Okay. I have to,
[17693.54s -> 17717.78s]  you had a mirror problem. Both mirrors are just one and then scratches. Nice. Nice. Okay.
[17717.78s -> 17731.93s]  Gas station level three. These are all, I gotta throw these away. All these deflated tires. Oh,
[17731.93s -> 17743.88s]  whatever. Okay. Let's go on to the next step. Now I'm going to close the store after this.
[17744.36s -> 17753.11s]  I feel like I'm kind of, I have money. This is where you become a combination KFC.
[17755.74s -> 17769.48s]  That's a good one. I like that one. Okay. Level 700 bucks. Let's go. So what does that do?
[17774.26s -> 17783.96s]  Ooh, it's like a freezer section. Cool. Reconstruct the bus stop. And this action
[17783.96s -> 17806.20s]  might have direct and immediate consequences. Get ready. What? Where is that? Bus stop? Gas stop?
[17806.76s -> 17827.34s]  Where's the bus stop? I need to restock shelves. I'm not going to do, I'm going to have to get ready.
[17831.78s -> 17844.81s]  Yeah, I gotta get ready. I need more materials. Other? Oh, more parking. Toilet. I can do two
[17844.81s -> 17862.22s]  toilets. Second toilet. Okay. Oh, a second fuel dispenser. Shit. I need money. Bus stop. Don't
[17862.22s -> 17877.82s]  buy that yet. I'm going to fill up on some products. What do I need? I need alcohol.
[17878.54s -> 17906.20s]  Insufficient warehouse space. Okay. How much fuel do I have? I think I need fuel. I have
[17906.20s -> 17919.80s]  160. I got plenty. Stock what you have. I got those. No more cigarettes. I have no more alcohol.
[17919.80s -> 17924.30s]  I need a freezer, right? Yeah. I need a storage shelf. I need like an ice cream thing.
[17927.72s -> 17945.74s]  Ice cream. This is so expensive. 260 bucks. What are you talking about? Where do you mind? Shit.
[17945.74s -> 17956.33s]  What do you want? I don't know. A tire. Damn it. You need a tire. Can I put one of these
[17957.05s -> 17979.83s]  dead ones on? Oh, one's on the ground. All right. Give me one second. I think Otto needs to go
[17979.83s -> 17985.27s]  outside. I'll be right back. Yes. Is it? You need to go outside? We'll take a second break. I'll be
[17985.27s -> 18372.41s]  right back. Guess what you get to hear. That's right. Okay. I am back. Right at the very end.
[18372.41s -> 18384.23s]  Right what it ended. Perfect timing. Okay. Yeah. I had to take care of Otto. What time is it?
[18384.23s -> 18390.18s]  What do you go for time? Let's have one of mine stream for five hours. We'll go for like another
[18390.18s -> 18402.76s]  hour. We'll keep going. I'm curious about what this next step is here. Do not reset character.
[18402.76s -> 18420.07s]  Oh my goodness. That's so close to resume. Over here. What's going on? He's all over the floor.
[18420.07s -> 18437.08s]  Oh, if you get stabbed, that makes sense. If you get stuck. All right. That gives me...
[18437.88s -> 18447.64s]  I need more tires. I need more mirrors. I have five, four. Actually, I think I'm okay for now.
[18447.64s -> 18462.63s]  I just licked my screen and I got to be honest. The stream tastes terrible. No, those are the
[18462.63s -> 18487.88s]  boogers you've wiped on your screen over the last like six months. Boogers taste good. I can't. Oh,
[18487.88s -> 18504.09s]  it makes me shake. It makes me shiver. All right. I have enough to put the ice cream thing in.
[18504.09s -> 18531.83s]  All right. I need to rearrange this whole place. Good. Clean out all of my stock. Thank you so
[18531.83s -> 18542.38s]  much. That's 30 bucks. I'm going to do this. I'm going to close the store. If you serve another...
[18542.94s -> 18552.52s]  I want like at least 500 bucks. Don't make a comment. I'm doing it right now.
[18552.52s -> 18574.15s]  Can I get the distance award? Oh, I got it. Nice. Okay. That wasn't that far, but still
[18574.15s -> 18588.38s]  surprising nonetheless. Okay. I got to close. We're closed. We're closed. Oh,
[18588.38s -> 18605.22s]  there's two customers coming in. Okay. No. After this. Hey, get two more cars. No,
[18605.22s -> 18620.60s]  they're not coming for gas. All right. Close the store. All right. No new customers. It's
[18620.60s -> 18646.84s]  pretty dirty in here. Let's take care of that first. Filthy. You guys open? No,
[18647.40s -> 18672.15s]  we just closed. You just missed us. Graffiti too? Yeah, I will. You should watch the sorcery
[18672.15s -> 18685.10s]  tribute video. Sorcery tribute video. I'm interested. Oh, we're closed. Right. I was
[18685.10s -> 18696.58s]  going to serve you. Oh, well. All right. We have one cigarette left. One pack of cigarettes. That's
[18696.58s -> 18716.62s]  it. I need some major restocking here. First things first. I need an ice cream thing. It's
[18716.62s -> 18726.55s]  not even that much more money to get the big one. All right. I'm going to move this out of the way
[18726.55s -> 18729.67s]  for now because this is going to be the ice cream station, the ice cream and drink station
[18729.67s -> 18735.40s]  because this is blue. I was only blue because I haven't painted it. I thought this was ice.
[18735.40s -> 18762.87s]  I thought it was icy over here. Well, I'm keeping that theme. So let's retribute. Yeah. We'll,
[18762.87s -> 18767.02s]  we'll queue that up on Wednesday because Wednesday we're going to do just a chill stream, right?
[18767.02s -> 18785.18s]  Do tier lists. God damn it. I like that. Yeah. Okay. Is the section for ice cream.
[18787.45s -> 18795.66s]  So you are going to do tier lists. I'm thinking about it. I do maybe just like,
[18795.66s -> 18802.06s]  wait, I can't paint these. Can I paint the ceiling? No. Oh, God damn it. No, I don't want to do this.
[18802.06s -> 18812.57s]  I cancel, cancel. I want to cancel this. I, why am I painting the roof? Okay. Well, now we need to
[18812.57s -> 18824.26s]  clean this up. How about an ass eating tier list? You either do or you don't. It's either S or F
[18824.26s -> 18829.66s]  and it's one icon. I, you, you put it there. I don't need to have this conversation anymore.
[18834.58s -> 18847.61s]  It is clean in here. Let me put that against this wall and then the drinks will be on this back wall
[18847.61s -> 18866.02s]  here. Yeah. This is like the chill zone. This is the cool zone. Come on. Come on. There we go.
[18866.02s -> 18875.72s]  Look at that. Yeah. Awesome. Oh, I love it. No, put that back. Put that back. Stop taking them out.
[18875.72s -> 18898.15s]  How do I put it back? No, stop taking them out. Oh my God. Okay. That was perfect. That's fine.
[18898.15s -> 18919.69s]  Can they get to this if it's here? I wonder if they can't get to the ice cream and they get to
[18919.69s -> 18933.16s]  the ice cream still. I think so. Maybe not. Maybe we'll see. What happened to all the stuff? Oh my
[18933.16s -> 18942.33s]  God. I'm just a heart attack. Let's go back here too. Who cares about the window? Yeah, that's fine.
[18942.33s -> 18979.96s]  Looks good. Um, okay. Well, it's back behind the wall somehow. I guess. All right. What's next?
[18979.96s -> 18983.80s]  Alcohol. Snacks. All right. I think I, I, did I get an alcohol delivery? I did. Didn't I?
[18983.80s -> 19014.62s]  Did I not? Maybe I didn't. Alcohol. Well, these, these, one of those. How much is that? Okay.
[19024.06s -> 19029.43s]  Jerma, how do you deal with the winter lanterns on Nightmare of Mensis? I turn my volume down
[19029.43s -> 19037.05s]  all the way and just go and kill them as fast as I can because the audio is what causes the
[19037.05s -> 19042.25s]  most problems for you because it's the most terrifying sound that's ever been put in a video
[19042.25s -> 19059.40s]  game. Fuck, I had alcohol. Can I cancel? Can I cancel that delivery? I needed snacks, not alcohol.
[19059.72s -> 19071.66s]  Whatever. He's already here. Wave him down. I'm canceling. I cancelled the order. I cancelled
[19071.66s -> 19078.52s]  the order in the app. I'm sorry. I cancelled the order in the app. No, I, no, I know. I'm sorry.
[19087.03s -> 19105.26s]  Make another alcohol shelf. I don't think I can afford to buy one. They're like $300. Yeah. 170
[19105.26s -> 19117.70s]  bucks. All right. I can open up the store now though. Let me just make sure I clean up. I need
[19117.78s -> 19139.50s]  snacks and smokes. That's true. I have plenty of alcohol forever now. Hey, goodbye. Please leave
[19140.06s -> 19143.58s]  so I can do the funny thing where I close the gate when your truck is halfway out
[19143.58s -> 19160.20s]  and we see what happens. Oh, you made it. I think you broke my garage door.
[19161.24s -> 19183.26s]  Oh shit. I think it is broken. All right. We're good. Jerma, you're not beating the furry
[19183.26s -> 19197.00s]  allegations. I don't know. When did I say I was a furry? All right. Open the store. I have to
[19197.00s -> 19204.73s]  to make some money and then I'm going to reconstruct the, that thing, the bus stop.
[19204.73s -> 19242.47s]  I don't even know what color it is. Hopefully this is the right color. It is. Okay. Good. Hey,
[19242.47s -> 19259.67s]  I have a lot more to paint. Friendly reminder, Jerma once went incognito to a furry convention.
[19259.67s -> 19289.42s]  Well, no, not yet. Almost done with this. It's going to have to wait. Oh, all right. We can go
[19289.42s -> 19315.50s]  back to that. And this is not going to be a dollhouse scenario where I'm doing like,
[19315.58s -> 19321.29s]  oh, look at me, look at me and doing the walk and stuff in that costume. No,
[19321.29s -> 19327.14s]  no, I'm going to be stone faced. I'm not going to make any emotion. I'm just going to walk around.
[19340.17s -> 19347.86s]  Oh, welcome. A lot of you have this thing in your head where I'm going to be walking around
[19347.86s -> 19353.62s]  doing the look at me thing all the time and trying to get on people's TikToks and photo bomb. I'm
[19353.62s -> 19368.36s]  not going to do any of that. I'm going to be the most unassuming person there. Like honestly,
[19368.36s -> 19375.42s]  anytime you see any footage of somebody in a fursuit from here on out, from now going forward,
[19375.42s -> 19384.18s]  it could be me. I just want to make that very clear. You don't know.
[19384.74s -> 19411.05s]  That's more shit. I have to paint this. This is really kind of messed up looking to find the guy
[19411.05s -> 19416.95s]  that's five too. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Give me something heavy. I don't know why. Okay.
[19416.95s -> 19437.48s]  Where is he? Where is he? Where are you? Where is he? Get out of here. No, stop. You little shit.
[19437.48s -> 19449.32s]  Where'd he go? Did he fly away? I just saw the shadow on the ground. It was like a bird
[19449.32s -> 19468.95s]  flying. Where'd he go? Oh, you're stuck. Aren't you? Oh, there's a lot of people here. Oh God.
[19468.95s -> 19477.40s]  There's a lot of people. It's like 10 people here. No, I don't suck. Okay. I don't suck.
[19477.96s -> 19490.49s]  I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. Hello. Yes. What do you got? Ice cream?
[19492.54s -> 19518.18s]  Ooh, these are good. Nice. This is quite a haul. Oh my God. How much shit are you buying?
[19519.14s -> 19527.59s]  That's a lot of stuff. It was like six ice creams and like five orange sodas or something.
[19528.63s -> 19547.94s]  Like four beers. That was a lot. There was like 15 items. Ban me if I'm wrong. I bet you can't do
[19547.94s -> 19557.21s]  a perfect wolf howl on stream right now. Ban that guy for life. Ban that guy for life. Ban him for
[19557.21s -> 19561.05s]  life. He doesn't get to come back. He does not get to come back. Ban that guy permanently. He
[19561.05s -> 19571.99s]  does not get to come back. Wait, what was this? What was the stipulation? If I couldn't do it,
[19571.99s -> 19587.50s]  then he would get banned. I don't even know what I was agreeing to. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not
[19587.50s -> 19592.94s]  done. I'm not done with your car. I pressed the button to have it come down. That's it. You're
[19592.94s -> 19599.77s]  getting fucking swept. That's it. You get swept. That's it. Yeah. What are you going to do? Run me
[19599.77s -> 19621.59s]  over? You're going to run me over? Is that what you're going to do? Yeah? Get out of here. Get
[19621.59s -> 19644.23s]  out of here. Come on. Why? I got to get it to be just snap. There it is. I get to do that once a
[19644.23s -> 19672.44s]  year. I want to go audition for Mario. Before the audition, I want to make the audio directors
[19672.44s -> 19678.12s]  think that I'm really into the role and everything. I'm going to warm myself up to be Mario because
[19678.12s -> 19683.42s]  I'm a huge fan. Before I say anything, I get into the audition booth. I get into the room.
[19684.22s -> 19688.86s]  They're all like, okay, so they're waiting for me. I just put the headphones on. I start the
[19688.86s -> 19711.88s]  audition and I just start going. Then I do the Mario impression. Does that show passion?
[19714.20s -> 19718.36s]  Would I be the annoying guy that's trying to make his audition way better than everybody else's
[19718.36s -> 19730.57s]  and trying too hard? I'm going in with a plan, man. I'm going in with an audition plan.
[19740.47s -> 19745.27s]  I remember I wanted to be an actor. I always thought, man, if I ever went to an audition,
[19746.23s -> 19758.46s]  I'm going to stand out. You put it on the conveyor belt wrong. That's not my fault.
[19760.54s -> 19768.14s]  You owe me money for what you just broke. Hey, hey, I'm not done talking to you.
[19778.02s -> 19798.46s]  I could have been Mario. That person's liquid. That person's liquefied. There's no way.
[19816.46s -> 19828.63s]  Remember, you're not the horn section. You're the whole orchestra. Do I have enough to repair
[19828.63s -> 19854.86s]  the thing? Choice. It's quite a lot. It's time to repair. Wait, I think there's one person in the
[19854.86s -> 19876.23s]  garage. No, nobody comes to the garage anymore. You'd make a much better Luigi. I don't think it
[19877.50s -> 19902.84s]  would be a good Mario character at all. What? This looks like a wet paint version of this.
[19903.40s -> 19921.74s]  All right, I'm going to buy an order of snacks and cigarettes and then I'm going to open it up.
[19921.74s -> 19930.41s]  Snacks. These are popular. These are popular. All right. Order. Insufficient warehouse space.
[19930.41s -> 19940.73s]  Get out of here with this bullshit. Now I need cigarettes. We're going to go with the Super
[19940.73s -> 19953.86s]  Blend. Premium tobacco and Super Blend. That's a lie. I have room. What is this number even
[19953.86s -> 19962.65s]  trying to convey to me? 20 in brackets, 122 out of 200. What? 20, 122 out of 200.
[19962.65s -> 19988.92s]  This is delivery on the way. Can I upgrade the warehouse? I actually might be able to.
[19988.92s -> 20012.33s]  I'm okay on gas. I might need some more. Thanks. I might consider a trash removal
[20012.33s -> 20031.77s]  because maybe this smells. Still streaming. Yeah, for now. What's wrong with your car?
[20032.49s -> 20043.85s]  Can I do any funny dances? Yeah, I can do most of the Fortnite dances.
[20043.85s -> 20050.60s]  I practice them a lot. At least the default ones that came with the game. I haven't played
[20050.60s -> 20053.64s]  in a pretty long time. I have like probably two or three thousand hours in Fortnite though. So
[20054.28s -> 20075.03s]  I do know a little bit about it. Stopped playing it a while ago though. I can do those. I love
[20075.03s -> 20080.54s]  that game. I just kind of wish they would. And I want to say out of the building, when you like
[20080.54s -> 20085.00s]  build and jump around and build, I kind of just lost interest after a while. It's a really fun
[20085.00s -> 20098.71s]  game. I think it's really like great game though. You love making people hate you.
[20099.59s -> 20105.90s]  Didn't I say I was going to stop doing this? I did say that, didn't I? I made it pretty clear
[20105.90s -> 20130.97s]  that I was going to stop doing that. Well, well, well. Clean the scanner? I didn't even know I could
[20130.97s -> 20141.77s]  move my mouse in that direction. All right, get that delivery, order the food, and then we're
[20141.77s -> 20155.78s]  going to get the bus stop. Where's this delivery? Hurry up. What's going on? Something, there's
[20155.78s -> 20163.19s]  something wrong over here. Something's going wrong. Oh, this is the guy I threw into the atmosphere.
[20164.54s -> 20214.18s]  He's back. Yep, I got it. Come on in. This out. Go ahead and take off so I can close please.
[20214.74s -> 20226.42s]  Which is you just know the devs did not want to fix. What is that? Is that like a wait problem?
[20227.06s -> 20232.07s]  It just wasn't necessarily programmed that the cars were going to weigh more so they can be
[20232.07s -> 20248.50s]  moved very easily. Yeah, you can broom the delivery trucks. I just don't want to
[20248.50s -> 20272.33s]  because I need the deliveries. You're breathtaking. All right. Wow, these are popular.
[20272.33s -> 20289.88s]  Okay, now I need cigarettes and a little bit more ice cream and I'm done and I'm ready. I didn't know
[20292.20s -> 20330.86s]  I forgot to add the whatever. It's a naked guy in the store. No, it's not. Game lag.
[20330.86s -> 20350.31s]  That's it. Thank you. Okay. I've not cleaned the bathroom. Holy shit. That's accurate.
[20350.31s -> 20365.03s]  Oh, God. It's probably horrible in here. These like piss prints. Why are they weirdly single file?
[20387.70s -> 20408.15s]  Mm hmm. Give me a minute. Painting over the poo stains. That's just gross. Grow up, Jeremy. Grow up.
[20408.15s -> 20428.90s]  Oh, shit. Customer fuel. Cash register. Fuel is low. Customer garage. Mm hmm. Thank you.
[20429.78s -> 20435.14s]  All right. Next. This guy is naked. I thought you were lying. Holy shit. This guy has no clothes on.
[20435.14s -> 20462.14s]  Why is the merchandise so dusty? Hire staff? I can't hire anybody yet. I have to like level up.
[20471.46s -> 20523.67s]  Thanks. Out. Room the truck. You happy? Are you happy? Now it's stuck there. Almost got it.
[20523.67s -> 20538.82s]  There we go. All right. Now just keep going. You're good. Keep going. Stop turning to the pole. Yes.
[20538.82s -> 20570.07s]  Okay. He's good. He's good to go. All right. Time to open up the thing. How many people have I killed?
[20570.07s -> 20592.04s]  Zero. Warehouse door. It's okay. Let me just clear out this queue. It's a never-ending queue.
[20592.04s -> 20634.86s]  Oh my god. There's too many people. Thank you. Goodbye. Okay. What else did I get? Alcohol. He
[20634.86s -> 20654.78s]  made it out. He's a little wobbly, but I think he's all right. All right. One tire. Two mirrors.
[20654.78s -> 20681.77s]  Warehouse. I know. I know. I know. I know. There's a lot going on. Playing Among Us
[20681.77s -> 20696.31s]  mini games. That's fine. Thank you. Okay. I got a lot of money. It's time. Yeah. All right. It's
[20696.31s -> 20705.59s]  time. It's time. I need fuel. All right. I need a delivery of fuel and then I am constructing that
[20705.59s -> 20737.75s]  bus stop. All right. Let's go. One more delivery of ice cream. What are you buying? What is all
[20737.75s -> 20741.35s]  this shit? I caught that at the last second. How many? Did you buy like three packs? How
[20741.35s -> 20751.86s]  much cigarettes are you buying? Imagine being a cashier saying all this shit. What are you buying?
[20751.86s -> 20758.02s]  Oh my god. How many cigarettes are you buying? Too many. Two? Four packed cigarettes? What the
[20758.02s -> 20786.47s]  hell are you doing? Making money though. And now I understand. Let's say if I was running a store
[20786.47s -> 20791.58s]  or like a restaurant or something and it's like you got like 20 people in line and the person's
[20791.58s -> 20799.53s]  ordering. Just like, oh yeah. Can I, can I get it? I'm sorry. It's like you order what you want. Get
[20799.53s -> 20806.79s]  out of the way. Oh, but excuse me. Can mine come with light oil? No. Just order it and leave.
[20807.69s -> 20810.97s]  Oh my god. Let me see the menu. I'm like, let me give it a little closer look here.
[20811.61s -> 20816.09s]  So Dex, this says it comes with vinegar and oil. Can it come with just light oil? No, actually,
[20816.09s -> 20834.25s]  you know what? No, I can have a peppers on it. Yeah, just order it and leave. Clean the store?
[20835.13s -> 20845.05s]  It's always funny when people go to like a fast food restaurant where the menu hasn't changed in
[20845.05s -> 20853.69s]  like 60 years. Now does, does the Whopper come with pickles? It's been the same menu for fucking
[20853.69s -> 20860.38s]  a hundred years. What are you talking about? I don't, what? They have not changed that menu in
[20860.38s -> 20881.00s]  like, since like 1950. What if they, what if they don't know, Jeremiah? I know. I'm just saying.
[20883.90s -> 20896.28s]  That's, I love that video. It's like the funniest video. I can do a quick like this
[20897.64s -> 20901.80s]  fastest hot dog shooter, uh, in a North rest. I don't know. Probably the whole world.
[20902.36s -> 20903.00s]  I can do a quick
[20914.36s -> 20928.73s]  get the bus stop. Why is there? Okay. Here it comes. Here comes the bus stop.
[20929.37s -> 20945.53s]  A single bus can hold a massive crowd. I are some employees. I don't have access to employees.
[20945.53s -> 20968.66s]  Where do you see this? I have shelves. See it's grayed out, man. There's a, there's a bus comes
[20968.66s -> 20985.96s]  immediately. I don't have any more fuel. Uh, you know what's insane about that video? That guy,
[20986.92s -> 20990.76s]  somebody, uh, if somebody's like a doctor or a scientist or whatever, maybe you just know
[20992.44s -> 20998.74s]  he is, he's inhaling the hot dogs into his lungs. Am I understanding that correct?
[21002.95s -> 21006.25s]  How do we feel? No. Are you sure?
[21016.23s -> 21019.27s]  Yes. There's pickles on the Whopper. They've been there for 50 years.
[21020.62s -> 21029.14s]  Yeah. I can do the fries without salt. Of course I can. No, no, we don't sell another restaurant's
[21029.14s -> 21034.42s]  food. Why would you think we have another restaurant's food? Oh, sorry. Stole shit out of
[21034.42s -> 21075.05s]  my. It's time to clean up. What is going on? What is happening? What the fuck are these people?
[21076.95s -> 21083.19s]  Are they taking shit? What's going on? Are they paying? I can't tell if they're paying or not.
[21092.33s -> 21099.93s]  What is wrong with you? Is this Santa? All right. All right. All right. I'm going. I'm going. I'm
[21099.93s -> 21113.27s]  going. I'm going. This is going to be a ton of money. Okay. I really hate to be this guy,
[21113.35s -> 21117.83s]  but can't you all just order a huge amount of shit together? There's only four items in this
[21117.83s -> 21123.53s]  entire store. Can you just like kind of do it together on the same check? You know what I mean?
[21123.53s -> 21128.73s]  Like I'll just put like 10 of each thing into a basket and look, you can even pay me like 10%
[21128.73s -> 21133.45s]  under. I'll give you like a fucking warehouse price. I'll give you a bulk price. Just please.
[21134.25s -> 21153.24s]  What are they doing out there? Yeah. I don't have any gas. Oh, you guys are
[21153.24s -> 21181.08s]  fucked. How's that for a party music? Wait, that's it. What? Okay. So just to give you a
[21181.08s -> 21186.89s]  little bit, I'm not going to be doing this in the furry costume because that's me, right? That would
[21186.89s -> 21201.83s]  be me doing that. I'm not going to, I'm not, it's absolutely not going to happen. Hey, man. Hey,
[21201.83s -> 21210.31s]  what would you get? Pringles. Yeah. Me too. Hey, I also got two, three doctor peppers. Oh yeah. Me
[21210.31s -> 21223.72s]  too. Oh, the tongue. I mean, what'd you get? Hey, you know, you can't drop pepper and a, uh,
[21223.72s -> 21230.34s]  can't pringle, you know, it's just simple stuff for me. A couple beers. You got it too. Yeah, man.
[21230.34s -> 21267.05s]  Wow. Pringles. Cool. Awesome. Hope you enjoy the party or whatever it is. What the hell are you
[21267.05s -> 21303.70s]  doing? Yeah. Take this with you. I actually hit it. Where am I? Oh, imagine the cast. What happened
[21303.70s -> 21322.94s]  here? Answer the phone. Oh no. Somebody cars upside down. What happened? All right. Answer the
[21322.94s -> 21329.29s]  phone call from uncle Ted. It's not his name. I don't even know why I said that. I was the rush
[21329.29s -> 21335.54s]  hour nephew. Hope you didn't get trampled beneath all the customers coming in from that bus.
[21336.42s -> 21343.70s]  I've heard workers tell me I'm on the phone just between a passenger bus. I'm on the phone. Now,
[21343.70s -> 21347.38s]  if you're feeling overworked, how about investing in some help?
[21348.18s -> 21366.89s]  Trust me. Oh my God. Are you kidding me? Thank God. I need somebody to work this register.
[21366.89s -> 21379.26s]  All right. Uh, just hold on. Employee. There's nobody, there's nobody here. Employee camper.
[21379.26s -> 21392.07s]  Oh, they have to live. Okay. If they live here. Okay. I have an employee camper hire. Shit.
[21393.19s -> 21403.02s]  I didn't need to buy an employee camper. I need to register. Why do I only have 47 seconds to
[21403.02s -> 21415.26s]  make a hiring decision? This doesn't feel right. What? Um, okay. John's resume makes it clear he
[21415.26s -> 21419.58s]  is overqualified for the job. He finished law school and held a job as an attorney. He ceased
[21419.58s -> 21423.10s]  working in law at a strange time, too early to be a career choice mistake, too late to be
[21423.10s -> 21429.94s]  disenfranchised with his line of work. He does not appear willing to elaborate his website.
[21429.94s -> 21435.86s]  Surprisingly, does not. All right. The resume has no hesitation in telling that, uh, Emily is
[21435.86s -> 21440.74s]  looking for a temporary job. Her goal is to become a socialite based off her listed personal
[21440.74s -> 21445.38s]  information. Her previous work experience has all been mundane jobs at the service level, but number
[21445.38s -> 21451.64s]  she's worked in the industry for years now, she became a different person. Oh, right. Cause
[21452.28s -> 21457.75s]  23 minutes? What happened? Andrew just finished working three jobs simultaneously. There's
[21457.75s -> 21461.19s]  somebody else that he's looking for more profitable work. No matter the difficulty to have a little
[21461.19s -> 21467.37s]  more time to himself than, but why do I have 24 minutes now? The last page of his resume
[21467.37s -> 21475.26s]  notes that he is trying to save money for either a potential trip or immigration to Europe. Okay.
[21475.26s -> 21480.14s]  He's noted to be an outgoing, easily approachable man with no service experience. You can only use
[21480.14s -> 21490.38s]  his opinions to judge his effectiveness in working at the gas station. Okay. Cleaning six, register
[21490.38s -> 21500.98s]  one, repairing one, 14. I think honestly, I'm talking, I think a lawyer would do pretty good
[21500.98s -> 21511.77s]  behind the register. I'm going to go with the lawyer. Oh wait, I can hire you both. All right.
[21511.77s -> 21519.22s]  You both hired. Okay. So how do I, now what do I, all right. Well, I need help. I need some help.
[21519.22s -> 21530.41s]  Where's John? I just hired him. John, is he in his Hollywood actor trailer? Where is he?
[21531.13s -> 21553.03s]  He's resting. Oh shit. Look at this line. Look at this line. Come on, hurry up. How come I don't
[21553.03s -> 21579.74s]  get to go to sleep? Close the store. I mean, this is money coming in. You would after the rush.
[21579.74s -> 21606.18s]  There's a lot of people here. Do more cocaine. Stop staying open 24 seven. Why would the scanner
[21606.18s -> 21619.82s]  be on the other side of the basket? That's such a small thing, but I, it's funny. That's such a
[21619.82s -> 21632.58s]  little thing. You guys are making me fucking laugh today. Okay. Where is that employee
[21633.62s -> 21653.11s]  van thing? Whatever it was. I saw it get built. Where is it? There's a mirror. Only, holy shit.
[21653.11s -> 21658.60s]  You're going to pay me 200 plus dollars to just replace your mirror. Oh my God. I could probably
[21658.60s -> 21680.10s]  do this. You're not going to be, okay. Behind the warehouse. Is he in here? There's a health bar.
[21681.83s -> 21709.16s]  John, can you go handle the register? There's a health bar. All right. You take the register.
[21709.16s -> 21726.26s]  I will handle the cleaning. All right. If you need help, John's here to assist you if you need
[21726.26s -> 21751.18s]  it right there. He's ready for this trash and this place up a little bit. You're ringing up the stuff
[21751.18s -> 21761.22s]  more than once. You just rang up things like four times, John. And by the way, how come you can use
[21761.22s -> 21771.43s]  the scanner in the basket? I didn't even know you could do that. That's based. You're going to get
[21771.43s -> 21808.55s]  higher profits. Uh, what was that? I don't want to be like the annoying boss. That's like me. Are
[21808.55s -> 21817.58s]  you doing it right? Are you doing it right? I would need more ice cream, more ice cream,
[21817.58s -> 21836.49s]  more drinks. Let your employee work for eight hours. Oh, okay. Pretty good. Take care of this.
[21836.49s -> 21859.91s]  Thank you. Uh, nice work. Hey, premium. Wait, I owe him $22, but I can pay him 200. What does that do?
[21859.91s -> 21867.66s]  Oh, here's what I paid 200. I don't even have $200. Oh, okay. Yeah, I do. Hold on. Don't need
[21867.66s -> 21882.60s]  the garage. I got to make a delivery. Okay. What did I say we needed? We needed ice cream. I want
[21882.60s -> 21897.75s]  one of those right now. Okay. And I want bold almond. Also, we need some drinks. Okay. That
[21897.75s -> 21912.23s]  should be good. And then a snack. We got plenty snacks. It's far too much than I can hold. Come
[21912.23s -> 21941.34s]  on. Come on. I got to upgrade the warehouse. Oh, you're doing great. Warehouse. Oh, it's like
[21941.34s -> 21956.23s]  200 bucks to upgrade this thing. Finally workshop level two. All right. Not yet. Okay. Now I can do
[21956.23s -> 21969.77s]  this delivery. One ice cream and some drinks and what else? So maybe a little bit of something
[21969.77s -> 21983.38s]  for the car. It's going to be a lot of money, but all right. You kidding me. All right. Let's go.
[21984.02s -> 22013.75s]  Still have plenty of gas. I think I had a Raptor mask on. Hire somebody for the garage.
[22014.31s -> 22026.87s]  I couldn't hire a second person. A hire. No space for new employee purchase additional trailer.
[22027.51s -> 22040.78s]  You need to upgrade your station. All right. Look, can you hear his 30 bucks?
[22041.67s -> 22061.77s]  And I'll give you a premium payment after this. Go and head to the repair the shop. Plenty of
[22061.77s -> 22071.98s]  alcohol, ice cream. I got plenty of snacks. Okay. Get another gas pump. How much is a second gas
[22071.98s -> 22094.94s]  pump? 300, 350. Get a second dispenser. Good. Oh shit. I need to be able to afford to pay this guy.
[22109.29s -> 22149.30s]  Stop. I'm here. Old restocking. That's good. More. Nice. Okay. Restock all the shelves.
[22149.30s -> 22171.40s]  Clear. I think I need fuel soon here. Oh God. Where's your, I'm going to run out of fuel.
[22172.36s -> 22194.23s]  And that'll do it. That'll do it. That'll do it. Come on. Hurry up. 200 bucks. Okay. Get it.
[22194.23s -> 22212.39s]  You're a human parrot. I know. Just say shit all the time. Your employee is getting tired.
[22212.39s -> 22224.52s]  All right. I'll make, I'll send him. He can rest. I'm going to clear out this line.
[22224.52s -> 22231.16s]  You've been playing this for six hours. Yeah. I know. I mean, it's, it's kind of, it's fun.
[22233.48s -> 22238.41s]  It's just like a menial task game. It doesn't really need to be anything else. And there's
[22238.41s -> 22244.63s]  like a little, there's a slow trickle of upgrades. I think you want to keep going.
[22245.27s -> 22259.93s]  I think it's fun. All right. Here comes the delivery. I don't, customer's order. I,
[22259.93s -> 22275.74s]  you, I know you want gas. All right. Don't be mad at the customer. Relax. Good. Good. Okay.
[22275.74s -> 22288.25s]  Cigarettes are there. Booze is here. I got a fully stocked store. Oh, John. Yep. Connect it.
[22288.81s -> 22308.60s]  Fill it up. John, John, take a break. You can take a break. Excellent work. Okay. Uh, don't fire him.
[22308.60s -> 22334.46s]  Take a break. Hello, sir. Parked in a weird place. Where's this premium payment? I don't,
[22334.46s -> 22362.82s]  I can't give, I don't have $200. I, I have $143. No one in six hours has needed a full tank of gas.
[22362.82s -> 22391.90s]  Go perfect hits by serving customers to receive tips. My God. Stop shaking their sodas.
[22392.46s -> 22417.72s]  That's definitely supposed to be Elon Musk, right? Yeah, that was, I would say that was a great order.
[22417.72s -> 22427.74s]  Two of those like fruity pushup, uh, frozen treats and two popcorns. That was a great order. Oh,
[22427.74s -> 22443.72s]  I thought I didn't like the ice cream. All right. Clean up and then I'm going to go check on, uh,
[22443.72s -> 22452.86s]  I'm going to get a garbage to come and then let's go check on, I'm going to clean and then I'm going
[22452.86s -> 22476.74s]  to go check on John. Buy a new floor. You mean I could have had something besides this dirty
[22476.74s -> 22502.82s]  ass floor the whole time? Really? Decorations indoor. Oh man. No, no, you can't. How about an
[22502.82s -> 22517.80s]  old wagon wheel? That's cool. Let's get that. Cool. Put the clock back. Look, now I have,
[22517.80s -> 22543.38s]  the place has personality. All right, John, I need you out here. You have a minute. All right,
[22543.38s -> 22552.09s]  John, you take care of the, uh, I don't think there's enough materials. No, there's not. I need
[22552.09s -> 22574.20s]  a delivery of the materials. Um, go do the register. That helps. Okay. I need you to go
[22574.20s -> 22602.87s]  in and handle the register. Dirty bathroom and all this. Okay. We're good. Now clean the mirrors.
[22602.87s -> 22617.22s]  There we go. Fuel. How come you're not picking locks? What the fuck? I was curious why I couldn't
[22617.22s -> 22632.44s]  do this. I'm going to get in trouble for this. Picking the locks. What's in there? Five bucks?
[22632.44s -> 22650.54s]  That's it? Why am I saying that's it? Hold on. Oh, I need to be a master. I got a first try.
[22650.86s -> 22654.46s]  Hold on. You got a drum set and you need $18? Holy shit. This is perfect. Where's John?
[22655.10s -> 22686.92s]  All right. You just can't, you're irritating me now. Get out of here. Stop it. Don't rob too many.
[22686.92s -> 22692.79s]  Your reputation is going to be on the line. Shit. You're kind of right. Aren't you?
[22711.94s -> 22730.47s]  Oh, weird. The, uh, the owner of this place is just walking around picking locks. Stop,
[22730.47s -> 22767.02s]  stop moving the car. Five bucks. That's a lot. 370. We need, I need to buy more car parts.
[22767.10s -> 22776.17s]  Nothing's gone. I'm good. Hey, I'm going to tell you right now. I got a premium payment for you.
[22776.17s -> 22785.06s]  Keep up the good work. In fact, what I need you to do now, I really kind of need, I'm,
[22785.06s -> 22790.26s]  you know, you go ahead and you feel, um, oh, let's go help the cleanup.
[22790.26s -> 22823.45s]  Take over from here, John. Okay. We need tires. This is so expensive right now. God damn it.
[22823.45s -> 22847.46s]  140. I think I have a few of these. I need tires bad. All right. Hey, uh, all right. Come here.
[22847.46s -> 22869.27s]  Take that register. I'm busy right now. I got this. Okay. Finally, here comes the delivery.
[22873.19s -> 22888.63s]  You go ahead and keep them distracted. 16 bucks. Thank you. This doesn't open this one.
[22888.63s -> 22961.19s]  There's a master lock. Shit. Shit. Oh, good luck with the snakes. 11 bucks. Nice. Oh, delivery.
[22961.19s -> 22987.48s]  My stupid. All right. Open this door. Take the delivery truck. This is my, my order. I'm going
[22987.48s -> 23028.79s]  to lock pick my own order on. Hurry up. Wow. I'm sorry. She's just sitting there.
[23028.79s -> 23057.38s]  Okay. Fuck. I have one more chance. That's the best one all night. For sure. I ain't,
[23057.38s -> 23071.43s]  I think there's going to be one better than that one. Oh, God fucking damn it. I didn't want to
[23071.43s -> 23084.25s]  give him 200 bucks. Thank God. There's a timer. I didn't even mean to do that. You have a smash
[23084.25s -> 23089.93s]  brothers when you would do the hit the dummy with the baseball bat. And for some reason you did it
[23089.93s -> 23096.41s]  perfect that one time. It's 30 to 40% harder than any time you'll ever do ever again. That's how I
[23096.41s -> 23113.27s]  felt about that last one. I'm not going to be able to replicate that again. All right. My delivery
[23113.27s -> 23122.10s]  came in, so let's go stalk that. I can't believe, why did you tell me I could steal from people?
[23122.10s -> 23139.21s]  Now this is all I'm doing. Some comedian, some, you've probably heard this a thousand times.
[23139.21s -> 23144.33s]  So I'm not claiming this is my like funny joke or anything, but there really needs to be two horns.
[23145.05s -> 23151.93s]  It needs to be a like fuck you horn like, like this. And there has to be a little like,
[23152.65s -> 23165.72s]  huh. Should be two different sounds. You've said this before. Yeah, but I mean it.
[23166.36s -> 23170.66s]  How many times I would like to beep at somebody, but have it be like a, Hey,
[23171.38s -> 23176.42s]  I just like, I'm just trying to let you know something is a regular car horn is just
[23176.42s -> 23209.08s]  you're pissed. It just sounds so angry. Herb your enthusiasm. Yeah. Yeah, probably. I'm not even
[23209.08s -> 23233.77s]  working anymore. I'm just like stealing from people's cars. Come here. Oh shit. I still do
[23233.77s -> 23251.03s]  this. What do you need? All right. You got a messed up tire. I can take care of that.
[23251.03s -> 23270.79s]  This has been really cozy stream. Oh, thanks. I'm just kind of hanging out. I've been having
[23270.79s -> 23297.22s]  a great time and having a really good time. I need an anti-scratch. You're welcome. Shit.
[23298.79s -> 23304.79s]  No, wait, something wrong with your tire. There's something wrong with your tire. I forgot.
[23304.79s -> 23332.78s]  She's trying to drive. That's why I can't do it. Stop trying to drive and whatever.
[23332.78s -> 23374.74s]  What bucks? What do you have yet? 15 bucks. All right. That'll be 15 bucks. Where's John?
[23379.53s -> 23395.42s]  What's happening here? Hold on. There's nobody in this car. Does it help? What's that guy doing?
[23395.42s -> 23409.98s]  All right. No more stealing. I'm not doing that anymore. Where's John? How you doing, John? Nice
[23409.98s -> 23419.38s]  work. Good. Cars fueled. Shop customers met. Received tips and repaired cars. It's going to
[23419.38s -> 23431.54s]  take a long time. Hire somebody. I need another trailer, right? I can't get another trailer
[23434.07s -> 23441.70s]  until next level, which is probably going to take a long time. It's probably not a bad place to stop,
[23441.70s -> 23457.24s]  to be honest. He's stuck. He's not. What's going on here? Are you not ringing up customers?
[23466.90s -> 23475.98s]  These people are waiting for... How many people have you not serviced? Why does he have one of
[23475.98s -> 23483.56s]  those weird microphones? He's got one of those evangelical microphones. He's on stage doing a
[23483.56s -> 23497.91s]  stadium full of people. He's a televangelist. John, go take care of the cars. I'll get this.
[23497.91s -> 23527.35s]  You bought car goods? I only bought two tires. That's all I could afford. What's this thing?
[23527.35s -> 23532.02s]  What's this thing on the bottom? This product scan at a 732? That's kind of a weird number.
[23532.74s -> 23551.11s]  Out of 732? I kind of need to know what that means. Leveling up? All right. How are we doing?
[23551.11s -> 23567.27s]  Restock that. Restock this. Okay. Looks good. Holy shit. That was like a hiccup thing.
[23567.99s -> 23597.24s]  Don't fuck it up. Come on. It's right there. Where is it? Right here?
[23597.72s -> 23657.06s]  There we go. Running out of gas. No more fuel. He's looking for me? Where is he?
[23658.89s -> 23666.71s]  Where is that little shit? I got to keep some plates around or something to throw at him.
[23666.71s -> 23673.21s]  I don't know. I'm going to throw a can of Pringles at him. Where is he? No. Give me those. Give me
[23673.21s -> 23712.76s]  this. Give me. How do you miss that close? Just stop. Oh my God. Give me the... What?
[23712.76s -> 23741.98s]  What's going on? I didn't get it. What? How did I not get it? What the fuck is that?
[23742.62s -> 23770.63s]  Why did it break? By the way, thumbs down upside down is thumbs up. So, sorry. Blue rocket. All
[23770.63s -> 23779.69s]  right. I got some cool stuff. What did I get? Where's John? Oh, he's repairing somebody's car.
[23779.69s -> 23797.64s]  Never mind. Okay. Goodbye. Why am I still playing this? Oh, I don't know. I'm having a good time.
[23797.64s -> 23817.03s]  With the drum set in the store. I have a lot of decorations. I got to glitch a car into the store.
[23817.03s -> 23827.03s]  Yeah. That's a good idea. Oh, whatever. I'm out of gas.
[23827.51s -> 23839.86s]  How much do I owe you? It's going to have to be one of the little cars, I think. No,
[23839.86s -> 23855.90s]  there's no way a car is going to fit in here. No way. But what I can do, and I'm willing to do
[23855.90s -> 23861.26s]  this before the stream is over, is to put like at least, I would say at least 10 to 20 cars in the
[23861.26s -> 23892.17s]  warehouse with people driving them. Let's go ahead and get that started. Come on. Oh, no. I got to
[23892.17s -> 23899.51s]  open this first. Shit. Don't move. All right. You're not going to move. That's fine. Why is the back
[23899.51s -> 23910.81s]  door open? What? The back door shouldn't be open. No wonder the people have been stealing stuff.
[23912.86s -> 23933.38s]  All right. Let's go. This is a different person. This is not even the same person.
[23933.38s -> 23947.37s]  Okay. Good. There's one to keep you in. Yeah. You're definitely stuck. Let's try to get at
[23947.37s -> 23954.41s]  least 10 cars in here if I can. You're going to escape? No. Because once I get these two in,
[23954.41s -> 23978.62s]  I'm going to close the door. I wonder if they despawn. They might. Now you beep. Of all the
[23978.62s -> 23992.15s]  times we just go in here. I feel like I'm, what's like that sport with the, you're on the ice
[23992.15s -> 24008.52s]  and you have to go with the brooms curling. Okay. There we go. Now you're in. Okay. Good luck too.
[24008.52s -> 24042.14s]  All right. Let's close them in. They still in there. I want this close. See if they breed. Oh
[24042.14s -> 24047.56s]  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, we've got plenty of people to push on. Are you trying to scam me?
[24062.26s -> 24094.15s]  Just trying to concentrate. Hey, almost there. Nice. They didn't despawn. Perfect. I think I
[24094.15s -> 24128.41s]  could probably get 10 before this takes too long. Oh, drive this way. No, you fool. No, you fool.
[24128.41s -> 24148.65s]  All right. Get in. Very nice. How do you not have a headache? Um, I don't know. I don't. Are they all
[24148.65s -> 24178.46s]  still waiting here at the register? Stop. Why are your cars so much heavier than everybody else's?
[24178.46s -> 24212.02s]  There you go. Stay right there for just a second. Oh shit. You're in the way. You're in the way.
[24212.02s -> 24243.51s]  Just get out of the way for a second. No, she's escaping. No, she's not. Okay. Go on this way.
[24243.51s -> 24255.72s]  Excellent. Stop. Stop. Oh boy. Oh boy. This is becoming ugly. It's already ugly and I haven't
[24255.72s -> 24262.31s]  even started. It's, she's doing it. She's going to stop driving around. All right. We're secure.
[24279.75s -> 24295.69s]  This is way lighter than all the other ones. Holy shit. Look at how this looks like air.
[24295.69s -> 24305.42s]  John? John. I owe John 200 bucks. He's just there. Oh no, John. John, go take care of the
[24305.42s -> 24312.28s]  register. Okay. Wait, John, where are you going? John, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[24312.28s -> 24319.46s]  I need to talk to you for a second. There. Take 200 and take another 200. Okay. I just gave you
[24319.46s -> 24345.40s]  $400. Go handle the register if you could. Thank you, John. Your boss is insane. Well,
[24349.45s -> 24366.86s]  stay like that for a second. Car like, yeah, this is too, okay. John is keeping this place afloat.
[24366.86s -> 24401.64s]  Yeah, he is. Good. No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. There's plenty of room in here. This is a horror
[24401.64s -> 24441.24s]  movie from the antagonist's point of view. Just wait. Stay right there. Getting harder to get into
[24441.24s -> 24459.06s]  this room. What was that sound? I have to parkour over all these cars. Wow. Look at that. Didn't
[24459.06s -> 24481.18s]  even have to do anything. We got two. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, stop driving forward.
[24501.21s -> 24506.44s]  So me and John have quite an interesting operation here. So they're going through
[24507.51s -> 24511.27s]  the checkout line and they're driving through the exit over here and I'm pushing their car
[24511.27s -> 24521.40s]  into the garage. You should order a delivery. Yeah. The plan is if I can get 10 cars in here
[24521.40s -> 24536.81s]  and order delivery and then open the damn thing. Let's see what happens. Come on. You're dragging
[24536.81s -> 24558.78s]  John into this. No. There we go. There we go. Are the cars all spawned in here? One, two, three,
[24558.78s -> 24572.04s]  four, five, six, seven. Yeah. I don't even think I need to even close this. No, I don't.
[24572.04s -> 24593.78s]  I do not need to close this. All right. Send them. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Looks like this. No.
[24593.78s -> 24630.55s]  All right. Let's go. Come on. I need customers. Where's John? All right. Come on. Oh, there you
[24630.55s -> 24663.88s]  are. Rude. Almost there. No. Shit. So many more. There's so many more. There's so many. They're
[24663.88s -> 24701.70s]  all leaving at the same time. All right. You go in. Okay. You know you. Somebody's getting out.
[24701.70s -> 24710.26s]  Somebody's getting out. Somebody's getting out this side. Somebody's trying to get out.
[24710.26s -> 24724.97s]  This is a mess. Okay. Uh-oh. It's going to be really hard to get out. I don't think I need to
[24724.97s -> 24742.58s]  close the doors. Her car is wedged in blocking everybody else. Un-equip the broom. The broom
[24742.58s -> 24755.90s]  pushes it around. Nice. I'm not quite sure cars bounce like that. Somebody escaped? No, they didn't.
[24755.90s -> 24783.10s]  Oh, you're in. All right. Good. Not bad. We're going to have to make a little bit of room though.
[24783.10s -> 24788.62s]  So what I mean by that is some people have to get over on this left side here.
[24792.54s -> 24807.69s]  You're not going anywhere, so that's okay. Okay. That looks fine. You're not. You can't go anywhere.
[24807.69s -> 24810.57s]  One, two, three. All right. I got a lot of cars here. Let's get like three more.
[24811.13s -> 24827.02s]  I don't even think about it. Perfect. Perfectly wedged. Oh, perfectly wedged. Lovely. All right.
[24827.02s -> 24839.53s]  Well, there are no more customers. I think we are at the limit of spawn. Yeah, this is the spawn limit.
[24839.61s -> 24860.54s]  It's worse than before. There's more of cops. They're on to you.
[24869.26s -> 24881.72s]  I am Toga. Oh, shit. You almost got out. Is that the car? Wait, what is this car? Is this the one
[24881.72s -> 24904.09s]  I was just using? This car is really like bouncy. See? Why is it so bouncy? I'm being so bouncy.
[24904.09s -> 24913.58s]  What the hell? What is this accomplishing? You need to rethink your life. Well, I mean, there's
[24913.58s -> 24916.86s]  a goal here. The goal is to get a bunch of cars in here and then order a delivery truck.
[24917.42s -> 24940.41s]  So, I mean, there's a goal. I love how the shape of this car is hard to move around. God damn it.
[24940.41s -> 24951.91s]  You had so many opportunities to get away there. Oh, this car. No. We're losing people.
[24951.91s -> 24976.33s]  That's better. Yeah, that's fine. Do that. So close. You, get back in there. Got it.
[24980.34s -> 24986.06s]  They're going to start to just pop around and I'm not going to be able to stop it. Oh, shit. Oh,
[24986.06s -> 24990.06s]  shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
[24990.86s -> 25021.45s]  No, no, no, no, no. Damn broke. Nobody nobody's getting out the other way, right? We're good.
[25021.45s -> 25026.84s]  All right. One more and I'm calling a delivery truck. Why is this the longest stream you've
[25026.84s -> 25032.78s]  done in three years? What? I played the Lord of the Rings game for like 14 hours. What are
[25032.78s -> 25045.30s]  you talking about? That was like two years ago. Very invested. I'm going to call the delivery
[25045.30s -> 25049.13s]  truck and then we're going to play the tour go theme for like 10 minutes until the delivery
[25049.13s -> 25069.30s]  truck gets in. I don't want to be too crazy about this because they all have to go in.
[25069.86s -> 25085.53s]  Perfect. All right. In, in, in. All right. It's time. All right. It's time. This is perfect
[25085.53s -> 25123.34s]  entrance. I have to order the delivery truck. This is ready. All right. Save the game. Cool.
[25123.34s -> 25127.74s]  Okay. Order delivery and I'm going to sit right there. I'm going to watch it. The whole thing
[25129.61s -> 25137.67s]  and the master. I will not be pleased here. Take a shit load of money. You know what? Here,
[25137.67s -> 25144.47s]  just take it all. Take it all. And then, you know, just don't, you don't get out of here.
[25144.47s -> 25157.75s]  I don't want you, I don't want you near this. Hi, I'm Targa. All right. Let's call a, uh,
[25157.75s -> 25177.99s]  we need a big, we need like a big one. So tires go. I go from inside or from outside.
[25177.99s -> 25219.48s]  I wonder what's inside. Maybe what's a better perspective. Oh no, no, no, no. Where is he?
[25241.94s -> 25279.88s]  Where is the delivery truck? Oh, here it comes. Oh God. Here it comes.
[25280.76s -> 25297.05s]  Play the guitar. Oh shit. I don't want to be in the middle of this.
[25298.01s -> 25306.55s]  I don't want to be in the middle of this. Where's the guitar? Oh fuck. He's here. He's coming. He's
[25306.55s -> 25313.02s]  coming. He's coming. I can't even get to the guitar, man. I'm stuck now. I'm right in the
[25313.02s -> 25326.82s]  middle. I'm right in the eye of the storm. He's like, I'm not going in there. What are you talking
[25326.82s -> 25358.09s]  about? We'll go in there. Look, I am talking. It's going to be so hard to get him in here.
[25358.73s -> 25365.82s]  It has to be precise. Turn the car around. Turn the car around. Be facing the right direction.
[25367.29s -> 25380.26s]  Come on. You need to be facing the right way. It's not too tall.
[25382.33s -> 25396.84s]  I think a party bus just came in. Oh shit. I gotta get the bus. I have to get the party bus in here.
[25398.63s -> 25405.86s]  Come on. Get in there. Get in there. I have to get the party bus in here. That's the absolute
[25405.86s -> 25411.16s]  culmination of this whole thing. It's in. It's in. It's in. Oh my God. It's in. I'm going to the back
[25411.16s -> 25437.80s]  door. I'm pushing it in. Get out of the fucking way. Get in there. Get in there. It's in. Oh my
[25437.80s -> 25471.46s]  God. Oh, I think this is over. How can you work here? Give me that party bus right now.
[25474.92s -> 25482.06s]  I'm not having a good time at all. You know what? Hey, who cares? Everything's free today.
[25482.06s -> 25487.74s]  Everything's free today. You don't have to pay for anything. All free. I shouldn't have said
[25488.38s -> 25520.22s]  anything. Come on. It's all for free. Who cares? Can I join the party? All right. This thing is so
[25520.22s -> 25540.82s]  big. It's so huge. I have to get it over there. Nobody's even driving this stupid thing. Here we
[25540.82s -> 25563.22s]  go. Oh, what a perfect shot. I think the cop got out. I'm closing the door. I'm going to have a
[25563.22s -> 25615.35s]  rave in here. Make room. Make room for the party bus. It's almost in. Get this out of the way.
[25615.99s -> 25638.58s]  I thought he said imagine the fumes. It's almost in. Just wedge it in. Come on. Get over there.
[25638.58s -> 25656.38s]  Not bad. This might work. It's straight in. Oh, it's in. Get in. It's in. It's in. It's so close.
[25662.23s -> 25669.24s]  It's so close. One or two more pushes. This should be it. Got it. Done. Game over. Lock him in.
[25691.35s -> 25706.20s]  All it takes is a little bit of chaos and this should start moving.
[25706.20s -> 25715.77s]  I can't play Venga bus. It's illegal. Okay. That car is hiding from me. That car is currently
[25715.77s -> 25726.36s]  hiding. Like I can't see you. Does that mean all the aliens are going to come back here?
[25735.86s -> 25772.30s]  I don't think there's any more cars. Oh, shit. Who are you? We got to go in the back. Get a
[25772.30s -> 25787.22s]  plane in here. I don't think I can't drive a plane. Just go this way. Drive around. You can do it.
[25787.22s -> 25813.24s]  Don't worry about that. I don't think there's much else I can do. You need a fuel truck.
[25813.24s -> 25823.75s]  Don't even tell me to do that. I'm pretty sure that's the end.
[25823.75s -> 25833.03s]  Close both ends? I don't think I can. I don't even know how this car got like this.
[25838.44s -> 25851.34s]  I can't go that way. I should be able to close both now, right? Yeah.
[25858.58s -> 25869.61s]  Mart, you waited till I opened the door. Then you think you can get out. Very smart.
[25869.61s -> 25878.86s]  Why am I speaking with a fake English accent? I'm going to let you go. Yes, fucking kidding.
[25892.22s -> 25926.79s]  Can I pick the party bus? No. Master Lock. I can't sit down. What the fuck?
[25927.59s -> 25938.04s]  I can't sit down and play this. There's a truck on it. Really? Oh, that's annoying.
[25945.24s -> 25959.42s]  Nope. It's broken. All right. That's it. I'm out. I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[25960.06s -> 25996.47s]  Press the red button. What the hell? This has been a gas station simulator. I recommend it.
[25996.47s -> 26004.65s]  Very fun. I think that I had a pretty good time. That was a good time.
[26004.65s -> 26011.99s]  And I'll see you guys on Wednesday. We're going to do some redoing some tier lists.
[26011.99s -> 26018.73s]  I've been to more restaurants. I think I have more. I want to see how much I am the same.
[26018.73s -> 26026.23s]  Maybe I'm a little different than a few years ago. So we'll see you Wednesday.
[26026.23s -> 26029.75s]  Have a good rest of your weekend. Tomorrow is, well, it's kind of the end of the weekend
[26029.75s -> 26033.80s]  right now on Sunday. Hope you have a good week though. We'll see you Wednesday around
[26033.80s -> 26042.87s]  two o'clock Pacific. Maybe we'll see you there. Take care of yourselves. Let's do the intro,
[26042.87s -> 26059.83s]  the outro, actually. Hey, look at this. Yeah. I love this one. I also have the other songs too
[26060.55s -> 26067.85s]  that Florida made. I want to compile like all of these and be able to kind of switch to them
[26067.85s -> 26088.17s]  whenever. You'll be hearing this a lot. Anything else we can suggest for Wednesday's stream?
[26088.81s -> 26098.20s]  Wednesday's stream? I need some protein. Jesus. Yeah. I kind of want to do tier lists,
[26098.20s -> 26111.50s]  maybe some quizzes. Just kind of chill for a few hours. It was just a browser-based stream.
[26112.14s -> 26126.76s]  Let's see. Do Buzzfeed quizzes. I want to do ones I haven't done before though. I did a lot.
[26126.76s -> 26136.28s]  It's going to be hard to even remember which ones I did do. But thanks to the subs, everybody.
[26136.28s -> 26146.58s]  This is the list of subs. Still a lot of people. Even since pulling back to like once, maybe twice
[26146.58s -> 26155.75s]  a week streaming, no one here is obligated to give me any money. Surprising all the time. So
[26155.75s -> 26173.78s]  thank you. Ray Joel. Yeah, sure. I'm just going to listen to this music all day. Speaking of good
[26173.78s -> 26189.40s]  music. I mean, who could forget this? I mean, this is like classic, right? This song is also very
[26189.40s -> 26204.22s]  lovely. All right. Yahoo. I haven't rated somebody in a while. Joel, what's Joel doing?
[26218.63s -> 26232.87s]  Grand Theft Auto? GTA Spooky Mysteries? What is GTA Spooky Mysteries?
[26239.35s -> 26253.48s]  It seems interesting. Yeah, let's rate Joel. What? Okay. Ludwig's playing this game called
[26253.48s -> 26265.78s]  Super Auto Pets. This game's cool. It looks like really interesting. Like a tower defense.
[26266.50s -> 26273.72s]  The new Twitch meta. It looks really cute. I watched him play it for like 30 minutes or so,
[26273.72s -> 26276.12s]  and I was like, I didn't have any idea what was going on, but it looked cute.
[26281.61s -> 26287.32s]  I go say hello to Joel and whatever this is, GTA, the custom mod missions or something.
[26287.88s -> 26300.68s]  Whatever it is, we're about to find out. I'll see you guys on Wednesday. Take care of yourselves.
[26301.56s -> 26321.21s]  Have a great night. You can get that to 7K though. I know you can. You can get that to 7K.
[26321.21s -> 26339.67s]  Come on. You can do it. I've seen you do it before. Come on, Gwen. Come on, Gwen. I know you can.
[26339.67s -> 26352.10s]  Come on. There we go. All right. I'll see you guys Wednesday. Take care of yourselves.
