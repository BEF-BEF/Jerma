[0.31s -> 20.70s]  Press enter to select Sexy Layla, Tough John, or Sleazy Estelle.
[20.70s -> 27.80s]  There you are, hurry up, we have a passenger to pick up. He's waiting for us at the El Banana Bar.
[27.80s -> 32.73s]  Alright, fine. He's waiting for us at the Banana Bar.
[32.73s -> 37.29s]  So you're the new guy, I'm Hank. I'll show you around and teach you how to drive.
[37.29s -> 40.91s]  Thanks a lot, Hank. I appreciate that.
[40.91s -> 46.30s]  Get there as fast as possible. If you're too late, the competition will have your passengers.
[46.30s -> 50.30s]  So, we're fighting over taxi passengers? Is that what's going on?
[50.30s -> 53.89s]  Take shortcuts whenever you can.
[53.89s -> 60.89s]  Wait, what? The faster and safer you jump just driving into stuff.
[60.89s -> 63.83s]  That wasn't safe at all.
[63.83s -> 66.42s]  So these are the passengers.
[66.42s -> 70.98s]  Alright, hey, where are they going? No, it's a setup. Ah, we have to get out of here.
[70.98s -> 73.54s]  What's a setup?
[73.54s -> 75.97s]  What is a setup?
[75.97s -> 77.97s]  What is a setup?
[83.19s -> 85.50s]  What do you mean it's a setup?
[85.50s -> 88.63s]  Wait, how do I drive the car?
[88.63s -> 91.63s]  I don't understand. Why would a taxi company set you up?
[91.63s -> 93.63s]  Is there a reason for this?
[93.63s -> 96.63s]  A rival taxi company? What?
[96.63s -> 101.58s]  I just, I just don't get it.
[101.58s -> 104.14s]  I just don't get it.
[104.14s -> 106.14s]  Why do these guys want to have a taxi battle?
[106.14s -> 109.14s]  You know what I mean? What the, what?
[109.14s -> 111.14s]  Where did that car even go?
[111.14s -> 113.58s]  I'll show you a taxi battle.
[113.58s -> 115.58s]  See you later, Frank.
[115.58s -> 117.58s]  This is my pickup.
[123.66s -> 125.66s]  Get in the car.
[125.66s -> 127.66s]  Ow, my, my head.
[127.66s -> 130.66s]  Oh my god, guys, I'm gonna die.
[132.54s -> 134.54s]  Oh, hold on.
[136.10s -> 138.10s]  How do I steal the passenger back?
[138.10s -> 140.40s]  How do I steal this guy back?
[144.82s -> 146.82s]  150 bucks? That's easy, buddy.
[146.82s -> 149.82s]  Come on in, honey. Let's move.
[149.82s -> 155.98s]  So, that's never gonna get old.
[155.98s -> 160.98s]  The car boogers coming out of the giant's sneezing nose is never gonna get old, ever.
[160.98s -> 162.98s]  That's what that is.
[162.98s -> 166.98s]  What kind of force is that? Like, seriously, why would that ever happen to a car?
[166.98s -> 169.98s]  Unless it was coming out of a giant's nose during a sneeze.
[169.98s -> 171.98s]  Watch this, ready?
[171.98s -> 177.21s]  Out of the way. Out of the way.
[177.21s -> 179.77s]  This passenger's mine.
[179.77s -> 182.26s]  Sorry, Jerry.
[182.26s -> 184.95s]  Maybe next time, Jerry.
[184.95s -> 188.41s]  Maybe next time, Jerry.
[188.41s -> 191.22s]  Maybe next time, Jerry.
[191.22s -> 195.30s]  Thank you very much.
[198.62s -> 202.62s]  No, get away. Get away from me.
[202.62s -> 207.03s]  Please, get away from me, Jerry.
[207.03s -> 210.23s]  Here it is, around this corner.
[210.23s -> 213.05s]  Just be careful.
[213.05s -> 215.05s]  Don't get knocked off the edge.
[215.05s -> 218.35s]  Okay, secret. I found the secret.
[218.35s -> 220.35s]  This is no secret.
[220.35s -> 222.98s]  Bad driver.
[222.98s -> 226.54s]  It seriously took you that fucking long to figure that out?
[226.54s -> 230.25s]  He's right behind me.
[230.25s -> 233.25s]  Can I lure him off the side of the road here?
[233.25s -> 241.72s]  Nope. He's too quick.
[241.72s -> 243.72s]  Where the hell did I just go?
[243.72s -> 247.02s]  Oh, great. Oh, great.
[247.02s -> 255.04s]  I'm going to bait you into this gas station and you're going to explode.
[255.04s -> 258.22s]  Whether you want to or not, it's gonna happen.
[258.22s -> 261.48s]  Here you come.
[261.48s -> 263.48s]  Yeah, good for you.
[263.48s -> 264.78s]  Good for you.
[264.78s -> 267.78s]  Come this way. Drive straight into this.
[267.78s -> 274.06s]  Now he's stuck.
[274.06s -> 276.06s]  I got him. I got him right where I want him.
[276.06s -> 280.64s]  Yeah, that was not the correct thing to do.
[280.64s -> 284.64s]  I'm not sure you know this, but that was really stupid for you to do that.
[284.64s -> 287.07s]  And your head is coming through the top.
[287.07s -> 290.07s]  I don't think you're alive anymore, but to tell you the truth,
[290.07s -> 292.07s]  I don't think you ever were to begin with.
[292.07s -> 296.04s]  So we're just going to keep going.
[296.04s -> 298.04s]  Man, that's not a good place to be standing.
[298.04s -> 300.66s]  If you want a taxi ride, I understand.
[300.66s -> 306.85s]  But you're going to have to be safer, buddy. You're going to have to get...
[306.85s -> 310.85s]  Would this person really be doing this for like an extra 15 bucks?
[310.85s -> 315.97s]  No, he wouldn't.
[315.97s -> 317.97s]  I win the taxi battle.
[317.97s -> 321.17s]  Jesus, Harry.
[321.17s -> 324.41s]  Let me just drop the passenger off.
[324.41s -> 332.73s]  Well, I lost the game.
[332.73s -> 334.29s]  Game's over.
[334.29s -> 337.55s]  I have no more taxi.
[337.55s -> 340.55s]  We're raining taxis from the sky now.
[340.55s -> 341.55s]  That's what we're doing now?
[341.55s -> 343.55s]  That's where we're going with this game?
[343.55s -> 346.50s]  You got to be fucking kidding me.
