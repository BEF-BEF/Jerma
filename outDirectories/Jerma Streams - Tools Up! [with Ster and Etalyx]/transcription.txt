[1.59s -> 5.19s]  Hello, everybody. How are you? Speak, speak, speak. I'm here. I'm here.
[9.18s -> 17.65s]  So today, we have been a night, saw you last night, but seeing you again right
[17.65s -> 27.66s]  now. We've got another co-op stream today. This one is going to be with some
[27.66s -> 35.58s]  familiar faces, Ster and italics. The three of us are going to play a game
[35.58s -> 41.74s]  called tools up. It's like a mix of overcooked and house flipper.
[43.90s -> 47.38s]  Who knows? The game might be good. It might not be, but it seems like it
[47.38s -> 55.50s]  could be pretty fun. We are currently streaming this through steam remote
[55.50s -> 60.28s]  play. So this is going to be a journey. We took a little extra time to get it
[60.28s -> 67.24s]  ready. So we have tested it. It does work. We are, but we're, we're ready.
[71.60s -> 79.90s]  They're both currently doing their intros because they're streamers. And
[79.90s -> 88.94s]  I'm just sitting here in outer space. Show us the hammer. Hammer. When is
[88.94s -> 105.26s]  halo? God damn it. You know, it's really, really awful. I feel like I need to
[105.26s -> 114.03s]  wait like a week to play halo again. I have such a, it's like eating ice cream
[114.03s -> 118.79s]  for the first time. You take a bite of ice cream while somebody stabs a knife
[118.79s -> 124.38s]  into your back. You are always going to have synonymous the memory of eating
[124.38s -> 129.93s]  ice cream for the first time with when you got stabbed. So I want to play halo
[130.61s -> 141.01s]  very, very badly, but I got stabbed while we played. It's all I, I got the
[141.01s -> 161.36s]  bad memory. Joel scarred him for life. Joel hates Jeremo. This is a different
[161.36s -> 172.16s]  co-op stream today. This is tools up. I wonder. Here's the funny thing. This is
[172.16s -> 175.44s]  what they know this and now you're going to know this. And it's actually kind of
[175.44s -> 180.84s]  funny. The way the steam remote play works is I am in total control of both
[180.84s -> 188.78s]  of their streams. I am broadcasting this to their computers. So I'm in
[188.78s -> 194.86s]  control. They have, they can't press any buttons. They can't change any sliders
[194.86s -> 198.86s]  or anything. So I'm in the driver's seat. So if I just start playing the game
[198.86s -> 201.82s]  right now, if they have their desktop audio enabled, this is going to start
[201.82s -> 213.78s]  playing. Let's find out. Let's see if anybody said, did it work? It should be
[213.78s -> 223.44s]  playing some music through there. No, hold on. I'm muted. Right now. Yeah, it is.
[223.44s -> 235.36s]  Alright, watch this. Yeah, come over here. Take a look at this. I'm in fucking control.
[235.36s -> 256.92s]  Alright, did I fuck up, did I fuck up the streams? He was muted. Yeah, no, they're
[256.92s -> 270.18s]  both muted right now. They're both doing their intros. Well, this is tools up. Or
[270.18s -> 276.30s]  are they both muted desktop audio and did I just do that to you guys? I wonder.
[276.30s -> 287.62s]  That's probably, yeah, that's probably what it was. But they're, hey, they're muted on stream, but they
[287.62s -> 291.70s]  heard it. There's no way they didn't. Impossible for them not to. It's impossible.
[291.70s -> 298.19s]  They heard that. Alright, I'm ready. I'm just gonna be in the
[298.19s -> 302.74s]  Discord call waiting for him. I'm just gonna be talking. Who are we waiting for?
[302.74s -> 314.42s]  Are you here? How's it going, everybody? What's going on? How's everybody doing? Yeah, what's up, man? Hey, dude. Hey, long time no see.
[314.58s -> 319.78s]  How's everybody doing? You guys all at the menu? How was your Thanksgiving? Oh, man.
[319.78s -> 328.38s]  What'd you guys, what'd you guys get for Black Friday? I got a table. You guys can't
[328.38s -> 336.06s]  both talk at once. Someone learn how to like... Oh my god, that's so fucking loud.
[336.06s -> 347.19s]  Are you nuts? He's doing it on purpose. I'm in fucking control. I had Jerma streaming a
[347.19s -> 356.04s]  game so that we can restream his game. No report. How do you report a player in
[356.04s -> 358.82s]  Steam? Well, you guys will be the ones getting reported because you're
[358.82s -> 363.22s]  streaming my stream. Alright, I had to turn you down to like 40% because you
[363.22s -> 370.02s]  just... You personally, your voice blasted my audio and now you're like quiet as a
[370.02s -> 375.54s]  whisper. Oh, dude. We've already played the game for 10 seconds. Fucking liars. Go back to our 10
[375.54s -> 381.38s]  seconds. I don't want to start over. Alright, let's do a new save slot. That one's
[381.38s -> 387.30s]  corrupted. Did you guys explain how this works to everybody? I don't know how this
[387.30s -> 392.70s]  works. Alright, Jerma is streaming this game to the cloud. The magic of the cloud
[392.70s -> 398.14s]  is enabling me and Stirr to connect and use our controllers as if we were
[398.14s -> 403.46s]  sitting next to him in the same house. Can you imagine being in the same house?
[403.90s -> 410.98s]  Yeah. It's called the internet. They just rolled out the internet this week and they're letting us try it as a beta.
[410.98s -> 416.30s]  Yeah. But this game is what I meant. I don't know how... I have no idea how this game
[416.30s -> 423.23s]  works. Alright, you guys... Here comes the cutscene. This game requires friends. You can be
[423.23s -> 434.57s]  anywhere on earth. That's us. How do you know? Hey, I'm driving. You haven't seen
[434.57s -> 447.50s]  this yet. Oh, nice. You almost hit that. Okay. Oh, yeah. Why can't they see the
[447.50s -> 453.98s]  cutscene? Wait, they can't see the cutscene? Hold on. My thing's bugged. I'm in control of the cutscene.
[453.98s -> 460.86s]  Oh, they can't see it. Wow. What? What do you mean nobody can see it? It's also showing the main menu. This internet
[460.86s -> 466.14s]  beta is not going well. Wait, what? Hold on. You guys skipped the cutscene?
[467.34s -> 475.24s]  Presumably. Hold on. But it's so cute. It's really not. Okay. I'm going to skip the cutscene.
[476.74s -> 481.46s]  So you guys just have to... I can see it now. You guys have the over cooked? I untoggled the
[482.98s -> 490.78s]  the cap feed and then re-toggled it. And that seemed to work. Okay. How does it look? You guys
[490.78s -> 499.32s]  good? We good? Who's player two? Who just did that? I am. That's me. I am. Okay. Okay. Hold on.
[500.52s -> 511.26s]  Because now I can't. Okay. Okay. I'm player three. Okay. Everyone remember that. No one
[511.26s -> 519.50s]  for the rest of any of our streams ask who is who or I'm going to be mad. Okay. First one ready.
[520.14s -> 529.30s]  Wait. What the heck? You just dropped out of the game. You hear me pressing? Okay. I'm ready.
[529.30s -> 533.70s]  All right. Are we ready? Yeah. First one ready. Let's go. Player one's me. Player two,
[533.70s -> 541.43s]  Talek's player three star. No, I'm player three now. What? Are you? Yeah. Oh, you are.
[542.31s -> 550.07s]  So no one asked. I'm player two. I just don't. I'm just like the Super Mario guy.
[550.95s -> 555.98s]  All right. I'm gone. I don't even know. I don't know who you guys are. I don't know.
[556.98s -> 566.68s]  I'm lady who is player two. So you got the hard hat. Left stick is elevator. What? No, it's not.
[567.72s -> 574.90s]  We're to fix this house. Oh, I just walked under a ladder. That's how much I did too. Hey, hey,
[574.90s -> 577.86s]  hey, hey, I'm the one in control. Don't tell me just did something and I'm supposed to be in
[577.86s -> 586.07s]  control. Sorry. I'll be here. No, I'm clear one. Okay. So we have to fix the house. Overall
[586.07s -> 592.31s]  progress. We're being timed. How are we being timed? What constitutes as a fixed house? Living
[592.31s -> 597.03s]  mom. The living room needs to be built. You're building. You didn't tell me there was building.
[597.03s -> 601.35s]  No, living room has to. What's that? The floor has renovating. We're trying to make this
[601.35s -> 607.59s]  a nice place to live in. Okay. Left trigger, right trigger. Oh my God. And Jerma controls the
[607.59s -> 613.35s]  camera. No, no, no, no, no, no. Whoever controls that whoever controls the blue camera has control
[613.35s -> 620.23s]  the camera. But what the hell paint the walls red. Okay. How do we do that? All right. I've got paint.
[620.23s -> 624.78s]  Okay. I took a door off. So it's X to do that. And how do you paint?
[625.66s -> 633.02s]  Um, we have to have paints to paint. I figured out how to take off doors. How do you pick stuff up?
[633.02s -> 637.98s]  We don't have any more paint. This is pain right here. Oh, okay. So you only can get
[639.50s -> 644.28s]  what you guys are already dead. I spilled it. How do you clean up this paint? What do you mean?
[644.28s -> 653.75s]  We're dead. All right. Well, you how do you recycle? What are you doing? Why are you riot shielding?
[654.71s -> 661.06s]  I'm beating the door. All right. Will you go take the blueprint? If we don't do this in two
[661.06s -> 666.66s]  minutes. How do we hook the doors up? We have 2.7 minutes. You press the bottom button. I don't know
[666.66s -> 673.30s]  what controller you're using. The A on the Xbox. You guys have Xbox? Yeah. I got an Xbox. Paint. I
[673.30s -> 680.74s]  asked for one for Christmas. And I got one. Okay. This is dumb. Oh my God. Okay. That's you doing
[680.74s -> 686.82s]  that. Oh my God. That's me doing it. I'm learning. We all had to do it once. Okay. So how do I get
[686.82s -> 691.38s]  new paint? Where's the tutorial? This is the campaign. This is the tutorial. This kind of
[691.38s -> 696.98s]  game that doesn't hold your hand. Are we out of? You need to turn it so we can see the other side.
[696.98s -> 701.70s]  Why am I holding a big milk carton? All right. Go. Oh my God. Don't let me have these. How do I
[701.70s -> 708.82s]  draw? I'm done. We have to paint. Okay. Okay. I have a new idea. I'll be the foreman. No. What the
[708.82s -> 715.80s]  fuck? There's three of us. Pick a room. Wait. How do you, how do you pick? Thank you. No.
[716.60s -> 723.16s]  Put it over there. This room needs to. No. Do we just have to paint the living room? When I go up
[723.16s -> 730.28s]  to either of you. Yeah. I think we have to flip so we can see the wall. Go up to the star. Come
[730.28s -> 738.76s]  on. Paint can. Hold X on the paint can. Which one? You don't know who you are? What are you
[738.84s -> 747.96s]  talking about? You've got a red hat. I've got an orange hat and German's got a green germ hat.
[748.76s -> 760.70s]  Yes. We did this. This is just a guessing game. No, it's not. You have red paint and you paint.
[760.70s -> 767.78s]  We just, okay. We went tidy up, get rid of all the trash. What about, okay. It says recycle,
[767.78s -> 773.19s]  but what are we recycling? How do you throw stuff and pick stuff up? My guy refuses.
[779.22s -> 783.70s]  Clean up, clean up, clean up. He just shakes his head. A throws. Pick that paint can up.
[784.42s -> 790.10s]  How? A and then use, that's how you throw. Why did you kick me out of the house?
[790.74s -> 798.46s]  Because no one knows what's happening. We still did it. Which one of these is you?
[798.46s -> 803.50s]  You. I'm the little guy with the German I'd hate five branded helmet on.
[803.50s -> 807.18s]  Well, then who's me? I don't know. I don't remember. You got to switch like five times.
[808.38s -> 818.58s]  Look, there are your controls right there. They're gone. I got a solid state drive.
[818.58s -> 821.94s]  There's not enough time to read those controls. All right. Let me be the one to help you here.
[821.94s -> 833.13s]  A picks up. Xbox controls. A picks up. B throws. X holding X does every option. B. Which one's D?
[833.13s -> 839.10s]  B as in bury. It's right there. There's only two buttons in the game. Just to pick up,
[839.10s -> 846.06s]  put down, hold to collect, throw with B. There are only three buttons. There's three buttons.
[846.06s -> 849.34s]  Well, now we know what they do. What are we supposed to do now? Now you. Okay.
[849.34s -> 854.23s]  Get the blueprint. I can't get out of this, by the way. You just can hold me forever.
[854.71s -> 869.45s]  You just hear a bully. Okay. Living room. Living room. Needs floors. Which one's the living room?
[871.45s -> 875.21s]  The living room needs walls painted. All right. We got to clean up the paint.
[875.21s -> 879.05s]  We got to recycle the rubbish. We got to use the buckets to put the rubbish away.
[879.05s -> 885.21s]  No, it does need floors. Yeah. Clean shit up. Okay. All right. I volunteer. What is this one?
[886.01s -> 890.89s]  I'll just be the foreman and I'll stand over here and make sure you're all doing it right.
[890.89s -> 894.33s]  All right. Pick stuff up and put it in the bucket. Just clean. Just help us clean.
[896.78s -> 901.74s]  No, don't throw it over it out of bounds. Listen, I've been playing with Nintendo
[901.74s -> 907.50s]  controllers lately. Who the fuck is this guy? This carpet guy. Oh, he's got the carpet.
[908.79s -> 913.27s]  All right. It goes in this room, right? Look, look, look. We can really speed this up
[913.27s -> 919.03s]  officially. I think we have to roll this. Are you awake? Yeah, I'm a foreman. I think he's
[919.03s -> 925.99s]  not playing. I'm playing. He's not moving. Have you ever been on a construction site before?
[926.63s -> 929.83s]  All right. Look, look, look. We're going to speed this up. Pick that up.
[930.55s -> 944.02s]  It's desperately telling you. What? I can't. No, I can't. Yeah. Yeah, they're still doing it.
[944.02s -> 952.22s]  You totally can't. That's what this is here for. Hey, which one's the living room and which one's
[952.22s -> 963.59s]  the kitchen? Put the bucket down. Yeah, they're still doing it. What? Okay. You're stepping in
[963.59s -> 972.31s]  your own dog poop. We have two minutes to figure this out. That's not a lot of time.
[973.19s -> 976.47s]  I'm going to be the foreman now. Yes. The carpet needs to be rolled in this room.
[977.27s -> 983.75s]  Stop. Just look at small Luigi Wario. Okay. He, Italics is a shitty foreman. Okay. I'm sorry. I
[983.75s -> 990.76s]  just had to get that out of my system. All right. Okay. We have a carpet now. How do we roll this?
[991.88s -> 1000.86s]  I think we do. We need help. So you can order stuff. Oh, there we go. All right. You can see
[1000.86s -> 1006.46s]  progress. We're five percent done in the living room. Take, take. Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1006.46s -> 1011.34s]  Put it down. You can't tell what's happening when you're blueprinting us, you stupid shitty foreman.
[1011.66s -> 1018.44s]  Bathroom we were dealing with. Put carpets in the bathroom. Cowards. Why is, why is my character
[1018.44s -> 1022.36s]  just shaking her head? No, because you're standing on the square. You're supposed to
[1022.36s -> 1026.60s]  be styling. Because someone has to tell you no. Well, don't you have to stand on it and put it
[1026.60s -> 1035.86s]  down? I can't not stand on it. What button? All right. What color do the rooms need to be?
[1035.86s -> 1044.50s]  Does one need to be orange? Okay. I'll be, I'll be the foreman. I don't know what the foreman does.
[1044.50s -> 1048.34s]  The kitchen. It just tells you what needs to happen. Okay. So this should be orange.
[1048.34s -> 1055.56s]  Kitchen needs to be painted. Orange. The living room needs to be yellow. How do you tell what room
[1055.56s -> 1061.46s]  is what? So the living room is done, right? Yeah. Now it needs to be orange. Walls in the living
[1061.46s -> 1067.94s]  room too? Ugly. Oh, yellow. Yellow walls. Yellow walls on the right, orange on the top. I'm doing
[1067.94s -> 1073.14s]  the orange on the top. I spilled it. What kind of fucking McDonald's play pen house is this?
[1073.30s -> 1083.19s]  I haven't learned the buttons yet. Can someone clean this up? Play, play probs.
[1085.18s -> 1091.75s]  You're doing a great job, Star. Walking back and forth from room to room. You're doing great.
[1091.75s -> 1100.71s]  It's good. Now X, hold X and then hold X. I'm doing it, daddy. How come you can only paint once per
[1100.71s -> 1111.90s]  hour? Because it's part of the video game. We got seven seconds. What? What? We're 89%. Clean it
[1111.90s -> 1115.42s]  up. Just clean it up. Clean, clean. There's no carpet there. How is there no carpet in that
[1115.42s -> 1123.50s]  corner? We did it. One star. It was placed in blocks. That doesn't make any sense. That does
[1123.50s -> 1132.42s]  actually not make any sense. But you ever like malicious compliance? No. Just put it down. Who
[1132.42s -> 1137.94s]  cares? Somebody else's problem now. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's my life. Let them put it together.
[1137.94s -> 1146.55s]  We'll just leave the paint cans there. The carpet. He's a Redditor. Shut up. Found out.
[1148.42s -> 1153.78s]  I can't believe we got 10 stars on that last one. Yeah. If you multiply by 10, I think I learned
[1153.78s -> 1169.30s]  the buttons. It scared everybody. I'm sorry. Let me go. I'm trying to shortcut you. Oh,
[1169.30s -> 1173.38s]  that's actually pretty good. Listen to me, everybody. We got it in the living room. We
[1173.38s -> 1177.94s]  got to put down the floor. But first you have to use the gardening tool on it.
[1180.47s -> 1185.67s]  The floor has to come in first through the mail. And then you have to paint the wall orange.
[1185.67s -> 1189.43s]  What do we have to do for that? Okay. So we need binding of Isaac damage plus what?
[1190.79s -> 1194.89s]  That's the binding of Isaac damage. No, that's like the gardener. You have to dig up
[1196.60s -> 1206.26s]  something to plant. Okay. The bucket is definitely supposed to hold access. Yeah,
[1206.26s -> 1213.18s]  it does. It holds trash. But how do you put it in there? Here, put it down.
[1215.11s -> 1221.34s]  It's A to put it in. All right. All right. All right. Here's the carpet. We haven't finished
[1221.98s -> 1228.78s]  moving this. Here, here, here, here. Yeah, there. See? Let's get it going. It's going to put trash
[1228.78s -> 1234.06s]  in here. Wait, look how fast this is. Oh, that is pretty fast. All right. So what this wall needs
[1234.06s -> 1242.98s]  to be orange, right? Uh, no, no, no, not orange. That's okay. This one's orange. I think so. Yeah.
[1242.98s -> 1247.30s]  Where the carpet guy go. Well, it depends which one is the kitchen and which one's the living room.
[1248.34s -> 1258.44s]  Get to the door. He's ringing the doorbell. Is he going to help? Okay. I'll be doing it.
[1258.44s -> 1266.92s]  He was about to leave again. Thank you. That actually helped. I'm, I'm the foreman. All right.
[1266.92s -> 1271.82s]  There's yellow paint coming in. Yellow paint just arrived. All right. This room's done.
[1272.92s -> 1278.86s]  I'm bringing you the yellow paint. Okay. Good. All right. In the carpet. Thank you.
[1280.22s -> 1285.26s]  We have to designate jobs. That's how this works. Well, I mean, we're doing that kind of honestly.
[1285.26s -> 1292.22s]  I can't paint this room. I'm willing to bet we get paid by the hour. Which room has to be yellow?
[1293.18s -> 1300.14s]  The top left one. Hey, but furniture delivery gets paid ahead of time. Oh, you got to peel the
[1300.14s -> 1307.72s]  wallpaper off. Shit. All right. I need that bucket. Throw that bucket in here. I'm getting it. All
[1307.72s -> 1312.46s]  right. I got the carpet done in the main room. What have you done? Trash bucket. I painted all
[1312.46s -> 1317.02s]  the walls. All right. Put it down. Trash. Trash bucket. Yeah. You have to peel the walls off.
[1317.02s -> 1328.04s]  Metallica. Get on it. I am already on it. He's already here. Get on it. All right. Get on that.
[1328.92s -> 1335.35s]  You're in the room doing the job. When you do that, it changes our controls just to let you
[1335.99s -> 1340.23s]  please don't do that. I'm doing it so that you can get the walls you haven't gotten.
[1341.19s -> 1344.87s]  I'm doing it intelligently. What about this one? You know nothing about.
[1344.87s -> 1352.87s]  Go this way. Hey. Wow. You spilled it everywhere. It's all right. It'll take two seconds to clean
[1352.87s -> 1364.84s]  it up. I really I didn't learn the buttons yet. I figured it out. I got it. I need to be very real
[1364.92s -> 1370.84s]  here. How how is it possible that you don't understand x and a dude? What this every time
[1370.84s -> 1378.76s]  I go to do something, I press the wrong one. Well, it's just it's a to pick up x to interact.
[1378.76s -> 1386.55s]  It's a pick up x interact. I mean, even I can figure that out. You're really downplaying yourself
[1386.55s -> 1392.71s]  there. You went to college. We got 91%. What are we missing? Of course you would know how to do that.
[1392.71s -> 1398.87s]  That the right wall, the right bucket, right wall. No, the right wrong with the right wall.
[1398.87s -> 1407.99s]  No, get out. I get my I want to get the glory. Oops. Wrong way. Right wall. No, we're good.
[1408.63s -> 1411.67s]  So what's wrong? We're missing the kitchen. The kitchen's all messed up.
[1412.71s -> 1418.39s]  It's the walls. We need to peel the paper or something. What is it? Yeah, it's not yellow.
[1419.11s -> 1425.67s]  Are we missing something? Spin it around. Not yellow. Spin the walls. Wait. Oh, shit. What the
[1425.67s -> 1432.65s]  hell is it? What? What? Oh, shit. Those are those are. Oh, thank God. They looked yellow.
[1432.65s -> 1436.97s]  They looked yellow. I'm with you. The people who they're just gonna have to pay us.
[1439.93s -> 1444.41s]  Like they're the ones that want to be shadow under 120 seconds. I think that's a little
[1445.53s -> 1456.23s]  extreme. Damn. One star Redditor. Hey, when are we going to get our first three star review on Yelp?
[1456.87s -> 1464.36s]  Not until Star figures out how to press X and A separately. I'm learning. You feel like this
[1464.36s -> 1469.67s]  should be on a 3D plane, but it's not. It's just left and right. We're gonna go in the elevator.
[1469.67s -> 1475.67s]  You technically can go forward and back. It's just I'm going in. You need six stars to reach
[1475.67s -> 1483.27s]  this floor. What are we getting Mario 64 right now? Yeah, we didn't do good enough. Get good.
[1483.27s -> 1488.31s]  You one started all three of the first levels. No, we didn't. We go. Yeah, we did. No, we only
[1488.31s -> 1493.99s]  got one star on every. We only got a single star. You know what? In this day and age,
[1494.71s -> 1498.23s]  that means we're willing to work for the least amount of money. All right. I'm on trash. I'm
[1498.23s -> 1501.91s]  on trash. I'm on trash. Do something else. I'm on trash. Get out of the way. Oh my God.
[1504.57s -> 1507.53s]  Okay, I'll be the former. Take that in there. I'm on trash.
[1509.32s -> 1516.68s]  Which button? You not know the button. Okay. Are you all right? Have you eaten today?
[1518.07s -> 1522.79s]  Yes. All right. I'm the former. We need yellow walls, rights, orange walls, top.
[1524.87s -> 1532.42s]  Is there any more trash? No more trash. Okay. I'm emptying this.
[1535.85s -> 1543.11s]  Hi. Did you just like smoke weed like an hour ago? No, no, I wouldn't do that. Oh, weed jokes.
[1544.31s -> 1552.06s]  Okay. You guys seeing what's going on here? All right. Good. I'm getting the carpet. Carpet.
[1552.06s -> 1556.86s]  Ding dong. Are we ready for carpet to go in the room?
[1557.58s -> 1561.32s]  Which button is the carpet? Pay no attention to it. I need two more walls.
[1561.96s -> 1570.92s]  I'll just start doing carpet. All right. Walls should be done. We also need to make sure that
[1570.92s -> 1575.46s]  it actually goes all the way. I know what happened. Somebody went like this last time.
[1576.18s -> 1583.22s]  That's what happened. Oh, that was 100%. I can't select the carpet. Somebody went like what?
[1584.34s -> 1587.70s]  If you don't hold it all the way, if you don't have enough carpet to do the whole place,
[1588.34s -> 1592.74s]  it doesn't, you'll miss a spot. Everyone loves holding the button. You're like a no man's sky.
[1592.74s -> 1596.90s]  You have to hold the button for every menu. Like, Oh, I want to change my brightness. Hold the.
[1597.78s -> 1602.26s]  Yeah. I actually, I agree. I disagree. I do. It should just be one input. All right. Tidy up.
[1602.26s -> 1608.82s]  We got that. That's three stars. Let's go. Who is who? I said, no one asked passively.
[1611.13s -> 1614.41s]  I was throwing away all this carpet. Tidy up for left.
[1614.81s -> 1624.87s]  Oh shit. Clean that up. There's like a Cheeto puff coming out of this can. That's it. Right.
[1624.87s -> 1630.63s]  You have to tidy up. Close the door. That's the carpet on left. Yeah. It's
[1632.76s -> 1641.74s]  a button is stun locked over here. Please. Got it. We unlocked a new character. I want to be Otter
[1641.74s -> 1651.78s]  boy. All right. When I asked my chat, what kind of gay animal I was, they said I was an Otter.
[1651.78s -> 1663.88s]  How do I change? What's wrong with you? Okay. Now everyone won't mistake that I am the Otter.
[1666.94s -> 1681.78s]  Okay. Okay. Ready? Yeah. Do we have enough stars to go upstairs? No, we have three and one and one.
[1681.78s -> 1691.29s]  We have six. So what is that? How many does that add up to? I can't, where am I? Three and one and
[1691.29s -> 1697.70s]  one. We three, four, five, six. Oh no. Oh, we do have six. Let's go. What are you guys doing?
[1698.81s -> 1709.27s]  Ooh, that was solid. We're going up. Why did it go back down? Going up because apparently we all
[1709.27s -> 1716.50s]  have control of it. I press down. All right. We gotta get a three star on this one. Okay. So it's
[1716.50s -> 1726.58s]  A to press up or put down or. Yeah. Hold on. Hold on. We have to dump cement or shellac,
[1726.58s -> 1732.18s]  whatever it is, into a bucket. And then we shellac the walls. Yeah. Stick the circuit boards in there.
[1732.98s -> 1738.68s]  Put your fork directly into the socket. Open the door. Oh, do you know what button it was? Yeah.
[1738.68s -> 1746.12s]  Talk shit. Get hit. I just didn't push the button is all. Okay. Here's the, so we go. So shellac
[1746.12s -> 1751.00s]  into the bucket and then hang on. Do you want to look at the plans first? Whatever we know what
[1751.00s -> 1760.26s]  we're doing. Yeah. Shellac. Okay. Okay. Uh, cause it's orange left yellow top. Yeah, but we got a
[1760.26s -> 1773.29s]  shellac first to get rid of this brick. Okay. I'm refilled the shellac delivery. I got it. Uh, do you?
[1774.31s -> 1781.74s]  Yo, what's this house? Why is this the neighbor? Do I just, do we steal our neighbor's fucking
[1781.74s -> 1788.76s]  sherbet? What is the, I don't understand. Yo, what's in the, uh, what's in the ice cooler?
[1791.30s -> 1798.09s]  What, what walls have to be, um, orange? These ones top right. Top right is orange yellow
[1798.89s -> 1804.89s]  and then left is orange. Is it? Yeah. Well, you can look at the walls. Yeah. Hang on.
[1805.93s -> 1810.38s]  Hold on. Wait, wait. I have to steal more ice cream from my neighbor. All right. You get it.
[1813.00s -> 1820.49s]  Fixed it. What is it? Just grab it out of his hand. Two spots up here. Embarrassing. There might even
[1820.49s -> 1826.57s]  be more. I can't see cause the person left the blueprints all the way outside the house. They're
[1826.57s -> 1834.63s]  saying we fucked it. You fucked it. You fucked it. What? What happened? All right. I'm doing some
[1834.63s -> 1847.11s]  rotations. Hold your pants. Who's going to get the carpet delivery? I'm going. Why did they deliver
[1847.11s -> 1854.20s]  to the wrong address? I don't know. Maybe that is the, why would this is, I have no idea. I think
[1854.20s -> 1862.39s]  this is the second house we're making over the wrong house. These people are just like on vacation.
[1863.19s -> 1870.02s]  It's yellow carpet in here, right? I hope so. All right. What is it? I need, I need this. I don't
[1870.02s -> 1875.62s]  know. Where's the trash. We also need to, um, kind of have to rotate. All right. I got paint orange
[1875.62s -> 1884.82s]  in here. Orange. Yep. I just make sure I shell act. Okay. We'll just paint over it. They won't even
[1884.82s -> 1894.62s]  know. The people that are going to know the people that own this house 30 years from now,
[1894.62s -> 1899.26s]  they're going to peel back three layers of wallpaper. Yes. And underneath it, I will have
[1899.26s -> 1907.94s]  signed my name and then, and we'll find the bones in the basement. I somehow knew that's where that
[1907.94s -> 1912.58s]  was going. I knew that's where that was going. All right. How are we doing? I'm flipping it.
[1913.14s -> 1920.07s]  That's a better view. All right. We need the, uh, we need carpet over here. Yep. No,
[1920.07s -> 1924.50s]  something else is better. We need carpet in here. Yeah. No, no, no, no. It's already here.
[1924.50s -> 1931.14s]  What's missing from the lip? What's missing from the living room? Uh, there probably is one wall.
[1931.14s -> 1934.50s]  There's one wall that's fucked up. It's one. You're like, it's right in front of this one here.
[1935.38s -> 1940.90s]  I got it. Oh, I got it. I got it. Don't worry. Don't even worry about it. I got that.
[1941.86s -> 1947.82s]  Man, I wish it would individually score us. You can see how good I'm doing. Wrong. Wrong.
[1949.13s -> 1954.97s]  Well, paint over it. Can I say I've got that three times. Then you just let me fucking get it.
[1955.61s -> 1959.53s]  I was, I know I did just, we were just playing baseball and I was a center fielder.
[1959.53s -> 1963.45s]  Cause I can't just repaint it. You called the ball and I just fucking ran in front of you and
[1963.45s -> 1966.81s]  tried to get it and we smashed into each other and it's a highlight reel on ESPN. I know. I
[1966.81s -> 1972.66s]  understand. Just fix it. That's it. The bones are going to be you.
[1973.94s -> 1981.06s]  So what is this? Like, uh, what's the ice cream bucket for? Uh, that was the shellac. Oh.
[1985.38s -> 1991.38s]  Steal their bathtub. And instead we had to do anything about them. All right.
[1991.38s -> 1997.94s]  There's only one door left. What is it? It's been us. Two left. Go shut all the doors. Three stars.
[1999.53s -> 2004.68s]  God, I'm working with amateurs. Really? Cause you just figured out how to use the buttons.
[2004.68s -> 2017.78s]  This level needs up there. How do you delete somebody else's entire Twitch account?
[2020.44s -> 2027.43s]  I'm working on it. Wait, did I pick the wrong same one? This is same one. Quit to desktop.
[2028.39s -> 2033.11s]  No, that would be bad. That would kill three games. That would kill three different streams.
[2034.92s -> 2041.78s]  I'm shocked that, uh, Cox is holding this. I know seriously, I can't believe it.
[2042.58s -> 2048.98s]  All right. Who wants to do what? Shellac. Wait, I got it. I'm going to blueprint. You blueprint.
[2048.98s -> 2056.57s]  No, I'm going to blueprint. You blueprint. What button is it? Hey, when somebody says they have
[2056.57s -> 2062.81s]  something. Okay. Look, look pink in that room. Remember pink in that room, orange in those left
[2062.81s -> 2067.05s]  room. All right. So we need to, we have things to do first. We're going to tear shit down.
[2068.81s -> 2071.69s]  We need a trash. The trash is right here.
[2071.69s -> 2077.14s]  No, no, no. That's the shellac. That's shellac bucket. That's the shellac bucket. We don't have
[2077.14s -> 2083.46s]  any other. Hang on. We did this wrong. What do I have in my hand? Shellac. How do I shellac?
[2083.46s -> 2090.46s]  The front room needs to be shellac. We fucked it all up. Just restart it. Where's the trash bucket?
[2090.46s -> 2095.99s]  I put shellac in the trash bucket because that we only get one bucket. All right. Tear down
[2095.99s -> 2111.00s]  and put in bucket. Do we need the sofa? Um, okay. You guys are doing a great job there.
[2114.73s -> 2125.40s]  Good teamwork. Okay. All right. It is a trash. Uh, star's only using one hand. So yeah. Um,
[2126.52s -> 2135.02s]  can somebody help me? I'm back. Can I get through? I, he blocked me in here. Can you bring that
[2135.02s -> 2143.75s]  garbage over here? I'm trying to dump it. Uh, it really used some garbage. Uh, all right. What's,
[2144.07s -> 2149.35s]  what, how are we doing? What's, what's going on in the kitchen in the kitchen is just orange walls.
[2149.35s -> 2156.46s]  You got it. Okay. Orange paint is hidden in the secret garden. All right. I'll take it. I'll take
[2156.46s -> 2163.18s]  it. No, no, no. I was already there when you called me. All right. Sorry. Ready for shellac
[2163.18s -> 2167.99s]  to go dump that bucket. And then we got to shellac that bucket. I don't, I don't remember how to
[2167.99s -> 2174.52s]  shellac honestly. I'll do what you said. I can tell you right now. It's, it's either X or a,
[2174.52s -> 2180.10s]  I'm doing what you said. All right. Bring this back over here. Here we go. Put it down.
[2180.90s -> 2186.78s]  Now we can, I'm getting a delivery. Is that a couch? That's a new couch. Is this a new like
[2186.78s -> 2192.68s]  Ikea couch we have to put? No, this is tiles for this front room. I don't know how to. All right.
[2192.68s -> 2201.86s]  This room's done. Um, what, what, what next boss? Um, I don't know. Well, what, what color do these
[2201.86s -> 2208.10s]  walls be orange? Paper is right up there in your room. All right. So yellow tiles in here,
[2208.10s -> 2218.04s]  carpet up top. We've read, but how do we do the tile? You just put it down. There's that red
[2218.04s -> 2225.37s]  carpet. Are you sure you just, how do we put the, how do we put this? How do we put it down?
[2225.37s -> 2230.01s]  Yeah. Well, it's either X or a J. It's going to be one of those. I can't get this might be like,
[2230.01s -> 2235.53s]  I can't remove whatever's in my hand. He's leaving. He doesn't. Oh my God. Every button,
[2235.53s -> 2238.89s]  I'm pressing everything. I won't get this thing out of my hand. Gotta shellac the floor. Gotta
[2238.89s -> 2244.55s]  shellac the floor. Somebody was just in the way. No, you gotta shellac the floor. Do you? Wait,
[2244.55s -> 2250.76s]  I can't walk over this. Oh, fuck. Here. What are we doing? No, we have to shellac the floor. Here,
[2250.76s -> 2255.86s]  take the bucket. See, it's Alex. You can't get this out of your hand. How do you get it out of
[2255.86s -> 2267.11s]  your hand? Okay. Put A into the bucket. Recycling full? No, there's shellac in that bucket. I can't
[2267.11s -> 2276.82s]  walk over there. All right. You need, wait, somebody get the door. We all run over to get.
[2276.82s -> 2286.86s]  I'm going to shellac you in a second. Okay. Keep in mind, when you shellac, you can't walk on it
[2286.86s -> 2295.10s]  for like 10 seconds. Why did you throw everything in here? God. Okay. Why is, why are the tiles up
[2295.10s -> 2299.61s]  in the top row? Because he's been, he's throwing them. All right. Here's what we got to do. We
[2299.61s -> 2308.07s]  got to, you got to tile. Corner out. I didn't throw the tile. What? Can't walk on that. Are you
[2308.07s -> 2313.00s]  picking this up from me? No, no, no. You have to shellac the ground and you can't walk on the
[2313.00s -> 2318.36s]  floor until it's done. I know. I'm being very patient. I'm just going to watch you guys. 40
[2318.36s -> 2327.91s]  seconds. I can't put this down. Oh fuck. Don't do that. It was the only place. Okay. Thanks.
[2327.91s -> 2332.87s]  Why is it in here? Why is everything blamed on me? But it's all italics. All right. I can't move.
[2332.87s -> 2342.55s]  Somebody has to do this. Cause you did it first. I just like fell down in real life.
[2343.96s -> 2354.28s]  I like slipped and I tripped and I, my control unplugged. All right. No. God damn it.
[2356.89s -> 2363.05s]  We got eight seconds. This is bad news. We can do this one. There was a new game mechanic. How
[2363.05s -> 2372.06s]  are we supposed to know? Wow. That's a zero star. I mean, you're only as strong as your weakest link.
[2372.14s -> 2381.06s]  I was the last to fall. I wish they individually scored us. Go that way. I could prove was he ever
[2381.06s -> 2386.42s]  heard he who smelted Delta. You are protesting quite a lot right now. Unprovoked. Pick a room.
[2386.42s -> 2394.71s]  Pick a room. Everybody pick a room. Pick a room. I'm just trying to do my job. And Alex is talking
[2394.71s -> 2400.47s]  about far. I'm in this room already. Did you not hear what I just said out loud in front of like
[2400.47s -> 2408.90s]  60,000 people? Hey, who's player one? I don't know. What button is it? Okay. I need that back.
[2409.78s -> 2421.19s]  Toss that over here. Thank you. Uh, is that couch actually supposed to come out?
[2422.71s -> 2432.09s]  Probably because you can make it makes it easier. No, it's not. I mean, it would make it easier.
[2435.58s -> 2439.26s]  Yeah. I think we just have to move it out of the way. All right. Somebody help me move the couch
[2439.26s -> 2449.85s]  out of the way. There you go. There you go. All right. Now we shall act. I will dump this
[2449.85s -> 2458.95s]  bucket. It looks right in front when I was to pick it up. I don't know what to do. This isn't
[2458.95s -> 2466.86s]  realistic. It's not going when you drag it. That's because there's good movers. We already put the
[2466.86s -> 2473.00s]  little cushions underneath each leg. I don't know what to do. Someone give me a task.
[2473.24s -> 2473.80s]  All right.
[2481.16s -> 2486.62s]  We have to show you to shellac these walls with the bucket of shellac. No, you don't. That's a lie.
[2487.26s -> 2490.86s]  I lied. Uh, you have to do that in the other room down here. No, no, no. That's also a lie.
[2490.86s -> 2496.86s]  Yeah. Do this in here. You shall lack the floor. Yes. So lack the floor. Use this bucket. You can.
[2496.86s -> 2504.22s]  Okay. We'll do it. Do it in an order that we don't have to walk. I need that paint door.
[2505.02s -> 2516.47s]  It's Alex door. Well, it's Alex. I can't move. Thank you. I was a fucking, that was a good play.
[2517.03s -> 2524.39s]  I locked you. I locked me out. I'm being, um, I'm being hampered. Sometimes it has to happen.
[2525.51s -> 2529.19s]  Okay. We're totally shellacked in here. There's a traitor amongst us.
[2529.19s -> 2534.55s]  Pick up the shellac. It probably works for a rival moving company. Oh my God. I do.
[2535.51s -> 2541.26s]  I took you. Hey, what are you doing here? Five missions to figure it out.
[2542.14s -> 2548.07s]  Did delivery guy just throw that? Or did you throw that? He walked into it and moved it.
[2548.95s -> 2554.07s]  Okay. We've got this paint that needs to come in here. All right. This couch is done.
[2554.71s -> 2561.75s]  Pink paint needs to go up on the walls. Carpet done. Yep. Let's get, I'll get this out of here.
[2562.47s -> 2572.49s]  Pink paint. And then we got to tile this floor. All right. Tiling is going to come last.
[2573.91s -> 2578.23s]  What about the orange paint? You guys already do that? I got orange in the left room.
[2578.23s -> 2581.27s]  All right. Let's let me check the blueprint. And I got pink in the top room.
[2583.42s -> 2588.22s]  Just the living room. That's it. Living room. We got to tile this room.
[2589.26s -> 2594.14s]  I didn't know that I couldn't walk over the tile. I completed it. We're good. Tidy up.
[2594.14s -> 2603.26s]  Start taking things outdoors. I got the tile. We got to move the couch back. Don't we?
[2603.98s -> 2610.15s]  Oh, I think it should be fine. Move, move, move, move, move.
[2613.19s -> 2617.35s]  Where's the red? Get him in the same room. That's you're walking pretty far to do that.
[2619.13s -> 2622.81s]  Now you can't get out. It's a 200 IQ play because we did two at the same time.
[2622.81s -> 2626.49s]  Yeah. But now he can't leave. Shut that door. Yeah. See, I got to shut the door anyway.
[2627.29s -> 2632.01s]  That's what I'm saying. Now he can't leave. He can't leave. He did it the wrong. He did it
[2632.01s -> 2640.65s]  from the wrong side. I didn't do that. Who did that? What? Wait, don't you left the tiles?
[2641.45s -> 2656.90s]  No, no, it's not worth it. Throw it out. Oh, almost. That was close. Look at my whiskers.
[2656.90s -> 2666.98s]  Can we go up the next floor? Are we allowed to go up yet? I knew that was the first thing I knew
[2666.98s -> 2670.90s]  it was going to happen. I'm supposed to be in control right now. It's not fair.
[2671.94s -> 2677.67s]  Oh wow. We all got an achievement unlock except only German gets it. The greedy guy that he is.
[2677.67s -> 2680.47s]  I think we just broke the game. I don't think we're supposed to be up here. So you need 15
[2680.47s -> 2684.87s]  stars to be able to be allowed up here. Maybe we have exactly 15 stars to be up here. We're
[2684.87s -> 2696.10s]  doing great. Oh boy. All right. Why are they delivering to us in a moat? All that stuff is
[2696.10s -> 2701.54s]  ruined. Important stuff coming down the river. Oh man. This is getting to the point where you
[2701.54s -> 2710.25s]  have to try, isn't it? All these sweaty try hard games. We have to try now. Wait, what did I just
[2710.25s -> 2714.65s]  do? I just wanted a relaxing game where I could chat with my friends and they have to turn it
[2714.65s -> 2721.90s]  into like an exercise. You know, games are supposed to be like enjoyable. It's funny coming from the
[2721.90s -> 2729.19s]  e-sports player. Who's that? Oh, I accidentally pressed the wrong button and now I have this
[2729.19s -> 2733.43s]  handful of paint that I can't do anything about until the paint comes around again.
[2734.47s -> 2741.02s]  All right. What room do we start in? Imagine your house is made of grass. All right. We should
[2741.02s -> 2746.14s]  probably just restart right now. This room sucks. It's the ugliest fucking room I've ever seen. We
[2746.14s -> 2755.10s]  don't have a single tool. All right. Restart it. Restart it. Restart it. No, you try hard.
[2756.46s -> 2770.04s]  We've been sitting around for a full minute. I was doing shit. All right. I have saved.
[2770.60s -> 2776.71s]  Just made a second pile. Okay. Trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash.
[2777.35s -> 2787.40s]  We got to shellac this room. You got to put a carpet in that room. Which room?
[2788.28s -> 2791.32s]  Hang on. We got more stuff coming down the pipe. Bring some deliveries out here.
[2792.12s -> 2798.58s]  All right. House is clean. We got to shellac this patio. Shellac the patio. You got it. Let's go.
[2798.58s -> 2806.28s]  Tear it up. Which room needs to be yellow or orange? This one. This one, which also needs to
[2806.28s -> 2810.76s]  be shellac. I can't get through the carpet. I don't like this shellacking mechanic right now,
[2810.76s -> 2817.88s]  I got to say. Well, it's only going to get harder from here. So I, what did you do? Okay. Well,
[2817.88s -> 2823.78s]  hey, could you open the door for me, please? This is mine. And this one. Thank you.
[2826.02s -> 2830.42s]  What goes on the patio? The tiles? Have they been delivered by the moat yet or no?
[2833.82s -> 2838.94s]  Do tiles last? Go up there. Hopes. I'm murdered.
[2845.06s -> 2849.88s]  Delete the ladder. Make him suffer. Okay. One button. I love this.
[2850.44s -> 2857.90s]  All right. We need to turn this. Well, a secret carpet in here.
[2858.70s -> 2867.30s]  There's still a couple of things I need to throw in that bucket. Okay. Do it. Well,
[2867.30s -> 2872.74s]  you want the carpet to go. I think the carpet goes in on the patio where the pool is.
[2873.70s -> 2878.98s]  What? Living room, kitchen, patio, carpet. I think it's actually patio carpet.
[2880.18s -> 2884.42s]  How do I shellac these? What? No, you did this. No, you just have to pull them up.
[2885.14s -> 2894.47s]  Now. Okay. The shellac is for another room. Okay. I'm losing it, dude. The kitchen
[2895.51s -> 2899.59s]  needs to have orange paint and needs to be shellacked and orange paint. I will go start
[2899.59s -> 2912.50s]  that process. This is, I believe this is the kitchen. It is not the kitchen. There's one more.
[2912.50s -> 2919.98s]  You got it. All right. I'm going to take a look at the plants. Kitchen needs to be shellacked.
[2919.98s -> 2930.78s]  We need to hit these walls, paste. Does that mean this room's walls are not supposed to be painted
[2930.78s -> 2938.38s]  or that one more? All right. We got a bunch of empty blue walls in that bottom right.
[2938.38s -> 2943.58s]  What room am I standing in right now? What is it? Was this the, is this the bedroom? What is this?
[2944.68s -> 2949.88s]  It's, it's really room. What if I told you that any room could be any room, depending on what
[2949.88s -> 2953.96s]  furniture you put in. Oh, I, I accidentally brought all of the stuff into this room.
[2955.24s -> 2958.52s]  Sorry. Alex is the kind of guy to put carpet on a patio.
[2960.28s -> 2969.10s]  We got a shellac this wall. Shellac here. He'll put you to fill the shellac bucket.
[2969.82s -> 2976.12s]  So we're done with the orange paint, right? I'm going to start cleaning up. Okay. We got a minute
[2976.12s -> 2982.50s]  50. We got two times. That's fine. How do I? Oh, okay. You filled it up. Good job.
[2983.48s -> 2986.04s]  Now we paste. I'm going to check the blueprint. Make sure we didn't miss anything in any of these
[2986.04s -> 2994.66s]  other rooms. It's the kitchen is at 0% by the way. How's that possible? Hey, can you improve
[2994.66s -> 3000.66s]  your upload speed a little? Why is my upload speed bad? No, it's just, it's like, I think it's just
[3000.66s -> 3008.89s]  that screen. It's just being mean. Uh, I was getting like 480 P for a second. Can you make
[3008.89s -> 3018.63s]  you like, can you make, can you make our internet better? All right. What do we need to do? That's
[3018.63s -> 3027.51s]  not a yellow wall. Is it yellow? No, it's orange. Just paint. Yeah. Yeah. Every time you do the
[3027.51s -> 3032.95s]  blueprint screen to me, it's like taking on, putting off glasses, putting on, taking off glass.
[3033.91s -> 3042.82s]  Yeah. Putting on, taking off. This wall needs it for the otter spinning. Are we done? That's it.
[3042.82s -> 3046.50s]  Tiny up. And you thought this one was going to be hard. We have plenty of time. This one was an
[3046.50s -> 3051.58s]  easier one. Throw it all in the river. Would they know? I think they know. Do they know?
[3053.00s -> 3059.16s]  Four left. It comes around to the side. Go up top left, top right, go top right, bottom right.
[3060.28s -> 3065.96s]  What? It's in the river. I think it counts. Does it count? I got it. I got it. I'll grab it.
[3066.92s -> 3071.24s]  Well, it's on this side, the bottom right. It's not going to come around. It kept getting flipped.
[3072.12s -> 3078.07s]  Is it just you? Wait, am I the trash? Are you? Can you come out of here?
[3079.59s -> 3089.56s]  Just shut the door. Oh, it's me. I'm the trash. All right. We got three stars for that one.
[3090.84s -> 3099.14s]  When did we get our ultimate? I'm sure there'll be another game mechanic. That's interesting. Hold on.
[3101.54s -> 3109.35s]  See, unlike games with ultimates, this one's balanced.
[3109.35s -> 3117.06s]  Okay. Paints. That didn't mean anything. This game doesn't have ultimates.
[3121.70s -> 3127.06s]  Okay. Seriously. I'm going to take a two minute break. I don't want to be a...
[3127.06s -> 3130.82s]  Man down, man down, man down. I think I'm going to have a cigarette. I'll be right back.
[3132.02s -> 3143.77s]  Where's the junk? Where's the trash? I have the junk at the top left.
[3144.81s -> 3148.81s]  Hey, where's the trash? I have the trash at the top left.
[3155.59s -> 3166.34s]  Stop removing doors. I need it to be done. It was in the way. Well, I'm just manually
[3168.38s -> 3176.71s]  manually going back and forth. How do you put doors back? You just hit A.
[3177.51s -> 3184.14s]  Oh, there's three buttons. All right. So the top left needs to be painted.
[3184.94s -> 3192.31s]  Hey, just click their head. Okay. Okay. Where is it? Oh, I got a lot of trash in here. You guys
[3194.84s -> 3199.64s]  have hogged the trash bucket the whole... God damn it. I'm bringing the trash to you now.
[3199.64s -> 3203.80s]  You could just like not do trash right now. Or I could just mute and go like
[3204.68s -> 3209.80s]  cough for five straight minutes to get this out of me. It's like something in my body.
[3209.80s -> 3214.04s]  You brought the trash to me. You still walked outside. Can you take commands from anyone?
[3218.17s -> 3229.30s]  Don't tell me what to do. You're a stoa. Carpet. Carpet. Top left. So what goes on bottom right?
[3230.54s -> 3248.31s]  Green paint. Hold on. Green paint, green tile. Green paint, green tile. Got it. What do you think
[3248.31s -> 3253.91s]  this is? All right. This rich asshole who has a tree in his house. Who has a tree in their house
[3253.91s -> 3266.02s]  and a moat around the tree. I think it just is the tree's house. This is just where they live.
[3266.74s -> 3275.66s]  Do we have to do anything with the floor first? No, it's already. It's already been slapped.
[3276.46s -> 3288.02s]  Let's actually. Oh, I'm barred from entry here. Sorry. What's left? That's a trash bin right now.
[3288.02s -> 3292.38s]  All right. Let me see. How are we doing? I like how you're not supposed to walk on this,
[3292.38s -> 3297.26s]  but as long as you just walk on it first, you're fine. Just that bedroom. This just needs that
[3297.26s -> 3302.78s]  carpet. And then that's it. Then tidy up. Start tidying up. What needs carpet? The room he's in
[3302.78s -> 3311.75s]  right now. We're done after that. That's not carpet. That's tiles. That's it. Tidy up. Fix
[3311.75s -> 3323.10s]  that door. Bedroom. Is it a wall that's not painted in the bedroom? Are you going to throw that real
[3323.10s -> 3336.38s]  good? Stop. That's the word. So what are we missing? Which room is it? It's the green room.
[3336.38s -> 3339.42s]  There must be one walls. Yeah, that's what I was looking for. And he told me to stop.
[3340.54s -> 3344.22s]  One of them. Oh, it's that one. I mean, it looks great. It looks great.
[3347.67s -> 3352.39s]  Sorry. Sorry. The guy's in the way who's housework. Hey, I can't see past the tree.
[3353.11s -> 3367.43s]  Okay. Here we go. All right. It's five stars. Well done. I don't think you need to close the door.
[3369.18s -> 3386.31s]  Oh, dog. Anyone want to be dog? We got the dog looks overpowered. It does kind of.
[3387.35s -> 3390.31s]  I've overpowered you mean huge and probably in the way.
[3391.03s -> 3398.07s]  So how come I feel disproportionate? I'm the only one who can paint tall walls and reach.
[3398.55s -> 3407.61s]  Stop going down. Nobody's doing that on purpose. Yes, he is. What do you mean?
[3408.33s -> 3415.53s]  I'm not doing it. I'm going to get blamed and it's him. It's not me. There's no way that's not
[3415.53s -> 3420.97s]  being done on purpose. It could be German. He doesn't know. All right. What do we have to do?
[3421.93s -> 3426.76s]  It's done. Hey, let me move this. Let's move the chaise lounge.
[3430.18s -> 3438.09s]  That room needs blue carpet. This room needs tile and that's it. That's it.
[3439.27s -> 3446.47s]  Is it? Yeah. That's it. I mean, it's a huge room though. I think it's because it's so separated.
[3446.47s -> 3449.35s]  Let's wait for delivery. There's a big wall right there. We'll start pulling it up.
[3449.91s -> 3459.11s]  We got to like throw stuff. I got the chalacum. Get out of here. All right. So we have
[3459.19s -> 3465.98s]  to start pulling up tile. Oh, there's a secret slipper there. We need that trash bucket in here.
[3465.98s -> 3471.14s]  We need to work together ripping it up. Somebody said only one room in this house is actually
[3471.14s -> 3483.40s]  inside. What? Because he's a tree bathroom. It's got to be the case. You've got to set it down.
[3484.36s -> 3499.56s]  Not whip it. Everyone get prepared. Carpet. Get that excellent German on 85 branded carpet.
[3504.46s -> 3510.55s]  All right. We basically just have to throw stuff over the wall a lot. I think it's raining and
[3510.55s -> 3518.63s]  it's making random things on the ground. Yeah. This person's house is outside. Yeah. What a shitty
[3518.63s -> 3526.18s]  house. Nothing we can do to save it. All right. Do we need trash in any other room? I don't think
[3526.18s -> 3531.38s]  so. We don't have the green tile yet. We're going to do the other room. We don't have the green tile
[3531.38s -> 3542.66s]  yet. Can you flip it by the way? This is a dog shit view. All right. Green tiles here. Wait,
[3542.66s -> 3548.26s]  we got to do. We got to do shit. We have to shellac it. I'll get I got I got I got I got I got it.
[3550.58s -> 3555.96s]  Toss it on. Oh, all right. Put it in. Who said that I didn't do anything this whole stream? I did
[3555.96s -> 3560.36s]  that right there. I'm done. I don't think anybody said that. I think you're just like projecting a
[3560.36s -> 3567.58s]  little. Why are you throwing it back at me? I don't need it. Well, maybe I will actually.
[3568.22s -> 3576.70s]  I didn't realize that that's such a limited quantity. Oh, all right. Don't get out of here.
[3577.34s -> 3592.65s]  Ice. Oh, okay. Wait. Whoops. I can go down here in a minute. All right. Then we did do that carpet.
[3592.65s -> 3600.81s]  You're doing the tile up there. Good shit. I think I'm all tiled up. All right. I'm going to put this.
[3600.81s -> 3609.29s]  We're going to go what corner out. That was just returning. Yeah, I wasn't sure if I missed those
[3609.29s -> 3619.62s]  or not. But look at the power of teamwork, everybody. You just put aside your differences.
[3619.62s -> 3627.35s]  Can you imagine that this would take 100% longer if it was just me in this room and not you here
[3627.35s -> 3634.71s]  too? You think about that? Like I'm fucked up. That is I'm thinking about like why does it take
[3634.71s -> 3639.91s]  two hours to put one table together when you pay people to do it? Do they not know the instructions
[3639.91s -> 3652.54s]  ahead of time? Why does it cost like a hundred and fifty dollars? This is my favorite comment
[3652.54s -> 3660.14s]  of the night so far. Oh, this is going too well now. Resident sleeper. Oh, no. Now they like,
[3660.14s -> 3665.74s]  they get it. No. Wait, there's something missing here. One blue carpet and a little green wall
[3665.74s -> 3679.88s]  is missing. One blue carpet. Yeah. Where? In between the trees. Oh, that's it. Any wet spots?
[3683.16s -> 3693.80s]  It's going way too swell. Dude, we got to install wacky mods. Basically beat the game.
[3700.22s -> 3706.06s]  Three stars. Oh, mega low clap. No, that was resident sleeper clap. I just pretended it.
[3706.22s -> 3709.42s]  Look at how hard this one looks. Does the guy have clown outfit rooms?
[3710.22s -> 3719.38s]  Okay. We've got new type of tile. I think we have to shellac shellac. So shellac this whole thing.
[3719.38s -> 3725.16s]  It's only these. Honestly, you asked me to play this game with you and it feels like I agreed to
[3725.16s -> 3731.96s]  chores and I didn't realize it. Yeah. But didn't you also play this or clean up detail? Oh, and
[3731.96s -> 3736.68s]  he, he hated it and he left the, he left, he abandoned the game and left the stream.
[3737.64s -> 3742.84s]  Yes. So that did happen. Well, we played for a bit, but I mean, I mostly just dragged all
[3742.84s -> 3750.20s]  the dead bodies into one room. Refuses to do chores. Yep. Sounds like a professional streamer.
[3752.55s -> 3759.59s]  Definitely a professional. What are these barrio blocks? These are locked. I don't understand. Why
[3759.59s -> 3771.05s]  is this locked? It's like, it's a locked information block. I don't get it. Why do we have so many
[3772.01s -> 3781.56s]  flower packs? What's the new thing? Why do you, why are you carrying around gasoline?
[3784.87s -> 3789.59s]  We might have to mix this stuff. It might be glue because it looks like there's wallpaper.
[3790.55s -> 3797.70s]  All right. Well, let's keep, what was this thing for trash? Do I think we have to like sift the
[3797.70s -> 3805.05s]  flower in there? Let's find out. All right. It's supposed to, it tells you the instructions.
[3807.06s -> 3812.26s]  It's shellac plus paint shellac plus carpet. Carpet. That's it. Yeah. I think we're over
[3812.26s -> 3816.74s]  complicated. There has to be like a second step though, because we have like these big flower bags.
[3817.86s -> 3822.10s]  No, I think there's just, this place is full of garbage. I think it's just trash. Yeah,
[3822.10s -> 3825.86s]  it's just trash. All right. We do only have one bucket though, I think.
[3826.58s -> 3834.78s]  Yes. Pick a spot up here and just, you're going to throw like a 30% full bucket away.
[3836.17s -> 3841.85s]  Inefficient. Dude, I'm trying to use the bucket for the like paste. What we got,
[3841.85s -> 3846.25s]  we're on one job in here. Finish this one first. But the trash can's like right there.
[3847.29s -> 3868.04s]  Okay, just put it in. What, what is this? Hey. This is, Star sees how long it takes for us to
[3868.04s -> 3874.04s]  notice that he stopped working in the, I think. Sorry, I took a drink like one time in an hour.
[3874.04s -> 3879.80s]  Listen, you're only as good as you're weak as Link. Or so I've been told. I took, I took a drink.
[3880.52s -> 3888.12s]  I took like a sip of soda. Get back to work, you fucker. I just want this to be as realistic
[3888.12s -> 3892.60s]  as possible. That's not efficient use of your time. Listen, you only get one break a day. Get back in
[3892.60s -> 3898.97s]  there and go to work. Yeah, you're lucky I'm not taking all the fucking doors off right now.
[3901.24s -> 3908.95s]  I'll do it. Zip. Okay, so what do we actually need here? What are we doing? What's going on?
[3908.95s -> 3916.76s]  We're both trying to do the same thing. All right, we got a minute 55 to do everything.
[3916.76s -> 3920.60s]  And what do we have to do? We just have to, we have to paste all the floors.
[3921.40s -> 3929.42s]  All of them? All in the left. We got to paste them all? Start in the back. What the fuck?
[3929.98s -> 3937.29s]  No, we don't. What? No, we just have to roll the carpet down. This is the only room we had to do.
[3938.09s -> 3943.77s]  Which room do we have to paste? We have to do the hallway. We're at zero percent. You're saying
[3943.77s -> 3949.53s]  we're done. Look, look, look, look. We have the hallway and then the storage room. The hallway,
[3949.53s -> 3953.45s]  every single one of these walls needs to be done in a minute. You're going to do that? Yeah,
[3953.45s -> 3956.65s]  you got a minute. Take another sip of your drink, you piece of shit.
[3956.65s -> 3965.75s]  We're failing. Yeah, there's no way we're going to be able to do this. Well, we're at 20 percent
[3965.75s -> 3972.79s]  now. We'll get one star on this one. So what is the shellac? That's okay. That's all we had to
[3972.79s -> 3978.84s]  begin with. Why do we have shellac here? I think we're done with it. The wall in here needs to
[3978.84s -> 3988.81s]  just be pink. Let's go. But we have to tear down the wallpaper. What do we have for percentage?
[3990.01s -> 4000.87s]  45, 50. Where's the garbage? Down the bottom. It's just a shellac bucket right now.
[4000.87s -> 4003.35s]  Well, I'll take care of that. Here, here, here, here, here. We don't need the shellac
[4003.35s -> 4009.27s]  for anything anymore, right? Right. 20 seconds. Paint as many walls as you can.
[4011.64s -> 4014.60s]  Why did they spawn this back in the same room that I was in with?
[4015.32s -> 4025.85s]  Please just put this down. 10 seconds. We're almost done. Bottom left, bottom left, bottom left.
[4025.85s -> 4032.18s]  I'm going to throw all the garbage in the neighbor's house. One, zero. Wait, what? How
[4032.18s -> 4041.96s]  do we get one star? The hallway was at zero. How? Did we paint it wrong? Maybe it's because we
[4041.96s -> 4047.91s]  didn't finish. We'll do it again. Oh, I'm just going to start removing things. Yes, just throw,
[4047.91s -> 4053.51s]  just start. That's first. Start getting rid of trash. All right, trash in the left room.
[4054.31s -> 4059.35s]  I'm going to, I'm going to tear down these walls. Gorbachev, Gorbachev, Gorbachev.
[4060.31s -> 4068.26s]  This carpet is here. Trash upper left. Carpet is here. Ain't that the truth? Why can't I just
[4068.26s -> 4077.82s]  throw this into the street? Yeah, what button is it? All right, the peel has been peeled.
[4078.54s -> 4091.56s]  Have you guys seen this otter? Do you want another drink, Rick? They gave us too many
[4091.56s -> 4096.47s]  paints to confuse us. That's the problem. Yeah, they wanted to test your foreman skills.
[4096.47s -> 4117.64s]  What if your color blind? Do we have all these? Okay, we're going in here now. Are you having
[4117.64s -> 4123.69s]  fun in here in this bottom left room? How am I falling down? Stupid fucking Minecraft mystery
[4123.69s -> 4130.25s]  block. Get the fuck out of here. Does Minecraft have mystery blocks now? It's been a while since
[4130.25s -> 4145.99s]  I played. To clean this up. All right, all the trash has been removed from the house. Incorrect.
[4145.99s -> 4151.51s]  We have the trash in this room on the floor. This fucking wrapping paper up here. Hold on,
[4151.51s -> 4160.15s]  I'll get it. Oh my word. This whole hallway is full of trash. I'm going for it. I'm getting
[4160.15s -> 4170.52s]  everything. Wow. It was 200 IQ to put all the trash in front of the recycling bin. Now I can't
[4170.52s -> 4183.14s]  get to it. I can't get to the recycling. All I hear right now is milk me. Listen, you're not
[4183.14s -> 4192.30s]  getting any of this paycheck. All right, so what do we need? Do we need pink carpet? I think we
[4192.30s -> 4201.03s]  just did it wrong. Where's the blueprint? Give me that. With three minutes. Hallway needs to have
[4201.03s -> 4205.59s]  pink walls, which is almost done. There's one thing missing somewhere. The storage room needs
[4205.59s -> 4212.31s]  to be ground. It has to be orange, not pink. And these walls on the bottom left need to be like
[4212.31s -> 4219.85s]  purple. Do we even have a, what color was it? Purple? No, just the ground. Yeah, that's it.
[4219.85s -> 4230.76s]  Now we just, we have to just do the carpet on the, oh fuck my mouth. Don't do that. Which
[4230.76s -> 4239.85s]  character are you? He's the one that just fell and broke his jaw on one of the counters. Which one
[4239.85s -> 4259.27s]  am I? You scared the shit out of me. I'm sorry. There are five different paints. I wasn't even
[4259.27s -> 4270.52s]  looking. That was so confusing. People in tabs are just like, wait, what just happened? Don't
[4270.52s -> 4279.02s]  read chat. They don't have anything interesting to say anyways. There's two. All right. If this
[4279.02s -> 4283.98s]  is a one star, we have to turn off this game. It's not going to be a one star. If we one star
[4283.98s -> 4290.79s]  this one, this game, this game's getting turned off. If you're not watching at all, you just like,
[4290.79s -> 4301.58s]  what, did he like bite down on a colonel? Can someone help this guy? And particularly could it
[4301.58s -> 4323.45s]  not be me? We just, we just do orange carpet. Oops. Just fight over the carpet. See? Hey,
[4323.45s -> 4337.45s]  we did it. This is a dirty ass house. Not anymore. It's not outside. There's something else. Uh,
[4337.45s -> 4343.69s]  we're missing one thing. Uh, no, we're missing a couple of things. Is it the outfit on the wall?
[4344.57s -> 4351.13s]  I'm going to rotate. Ah, fuck it. You're two of them. Yeah. I count as one.
[4351.85s -> 4359.16s]  What's the other one? Um, is that wall supposed to look like that? I guess so. Two left. What is
[4359.16s -> 4366.55s]  it? It's not on the wall. Shut the doors. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, I don't know.
[4366.55s -> 4377.24s]  It's not too close to the front. Mop it up. I didn't see anything. Yeah. I didn't see anything
[4377.24s -> 4386.23s]  either. It was, it had flushed the toilet. I think he had to plunge to the toilet. I mean,
[4386.23s -> 4394.07s]  we all took a shit in there, right? All wait. All of us. Yeah. And that five minutes without,
[4395.85s -> 4403.69s]  oh my God, we powered through. Is it an outhouse? Hey, okay. Okay. Pay attention.
[4404.49s -> 4415.88s]  You have to paint a wall with glue and then wallpaper. All right. So shellac wallpaper done.
[4416.44s -> 4425.51s]  Oh, now it's a different season. Uh, yeah, that's a ice mechanic. I was trying to throw you in,
[4425.51s -> 4434.70s]  but it didn't work. You now slip. Do we have a bucket? All right. Clean up. Clean up. Clean up
[4434.70s -> 4446.70s]  first. I have a question. Yes. Why would you want your house to be ice? Where like a cartoon land?
[4448.12s -> 4463.06s]  Say that word again. Cartoon land. I'm done. I'm done. I don't want to hear it. Okay. So living
[4463.06s -> 4468.98s]  rooms. I don't, there's too many things. I'm not the four minute. I can't think. My brain is dead.
[4473.50s -> 4479.50s]  Just give me a task and I'll do it. All right. Give us both a task. Uh, we got carpet carpet.
[4479.50s -> 4485.10s]  Where's purple carpet go? Purple carpet goes top right, top right. And the walls need to be done
[4485.10s -> 4491.26s]  up with the currently existing in the same room, purple tubes. So top right is purple.
[4492.22s -> 4497.96s]  The top right is purple. Top left also needs to be purple walls, but they need to be painted.
[4498.76s -> 4512.07s]  So top right is not paint. I'll wait till you're ready. We also need green carpet at the bottom.
[4513.03s -> 4526.63s]  I got it left. Purple paint on the walls. It hurts. I didn't know how long it was going to take. I knew
[4526.63s -> 4537.86s]  it was going to, I didn't know how long it was going to take. Talking shit. You messed it up.
[4537.86s -> 4549.30s]  I'm the floor is ice. I'm sorry. Green carpet. All right. Now we do this on the walls.
[4550.18s -> 4557.37s]  So we need that bucket back up here. Okay. But can I like empty it first?
[4558.42s -> 4571.22s]  Um, we already did. All right. Now we do the walls. Ooh, I like that. That's um,
[4571.22s -> 4578.20s]  Oh God, it goes away. No, maybe that means it just dries. Yeah. So you have to like paste it and then
[4578.20s -> 4583.32s]  put the, Oh shit. I got, I got you. I got you. I got you. You paint. Purple's down here. Purple's
[4583.32s -> 4591.75s]  down here. I got it. All right. Bring the purple up here. I'm going to paint and you go. Hold on.
[4591.75s -> 4597.51s]  I'm going to bring it closer. Oh no. No, that's no. Okay. I don't know why I thought you were
[4597.51s -> 4601.83s]  going to paint over the whatever. All right. I got the top left room because you're dumb.
[4602.55s -> 4605.11s]  I didn't know how long it was going to take. I don't know how long it was going to take,
[4605.11s -> 4610.57s]  but you're fucking dumb. Got them. You're going to see a couple of E he's. It'll be fun.
[4613.91s -> 4619.98s]  Wouldn't that be so funny if you did like a Keck. All right. This room is done. Get out of here.
[4621.30s -> 4626.34s]  I'm looking too long. It was targeting the thing next to it, even though I was very clearly not
[4626.34s -> 4634.42s]  looking at that thing. What a dope. Okay. Here you go. You ready? No, no, no. I got to get
[4634.42s -> 4647.83s]  rid of this trash because you've spilled something. Don't mind me. Just sneak it in. Here we go.
[4648.63s -> 4658.54s]  One more on this side. There's two more over here actually. Get it together. Do you guys remember
[4658.54s -> 4666.57s]  the nineties? I'm pretty sure he still does that. Pretty sure he does too. He's still currently
[4666.57s -> 4679.86s]  touring. That's it. That's it. We've got the ice didn't even matter. Be careful what you wish for.
[4681.85s -> 4685.61s]  And five left. All right. What else? What else? What else? What else? What else? What else?
[4685.61s -> 4694.63s]  I can't wait to wait to the lava mansion. The sexy magma girl, new animal. What is it? A llama?
[4699.45s -> 4712.33s]  Sure. I want to be that. How do I switch characters like this? Oh, who's going to be,
[4712.33s -> 4724.55s]  you're going to be the llama. All right. Be the dog. Now this is even weirder. Wait, which one am I?
[4725.19s -> 4731.27s]  You're the otter. Oh, now this is a cartoon. You've been extolling the virtues of being the otter.
[4732.23s -> 4739.96s]  All right. We did this. We can go up another level. Isn't it cool how like the otter gets
[4739.96s -> 4746.22s]  bonus stats in the water levels? Wow. It's got an achievement for Game of Thrones. Yeah. I got that
[4746.22s -> 4757.29s]  too. A song of ice and fire or something, right? Song of fire and snow. What's this one? I told you
[4757.29s -> 4762.49s]  to be careful what you wish for. All right. I'm getting the couch. Quote, the ice didn't even
[4762.49s -> 4770.70s]  matter. I would spin this because like this is a terrible angle. What's that noise? I can't,
[4770.70s -> 4774.22s]  we can't get in there. It's messed up. We have to go all the way around. I think. No, we don't.
[4777.05s -> 4789.58s]  Where am I? Which one am I? I actually got lost up there. Okay. Okay. Ready? I can't pick it up.
[4789.58s -> 4797.91s]  There it is. Where does this even go? Outside? How do we? Hold on. Let me open the door.
[4799.27s -> 4806.95s]  All right. Turn. It's ice. Oh, yeah. It is ice. Why? Why? There's three people.
[4807.67s -> 4818.98s]  Just leave it in here. Just throw me. Throw me. I'll get it. Throw me. Throw me. I am pushing
[4818.98s -> 4834.23s]  the throw button. Throw me. Oh, my God. Reset. Okay. Purple carpet. Oh, my God. You just told
[4834.23s -> 4844.17s]  me to do that. He told him. I thought you could like read. You just said restart, restart, just
[4844.17s -> 4850.17s]  do it. And I'm like, okay, why wouldn't we? Restart. Restart it slow. Restart it slow. Well,
[4850.17s -> 4857.74s]  now I know you're being fucking dope. Facetious. All right. What's the first room we're doing?
[4859.72s -> 4862.84s]  Okay. Fuck the couch. We don't. Seriously. It's wasting time.
[4866.12s -> 4869.96s]  Restart. You didn't get a good enough job. Why can't you read sarcasm?
[4871.88s -> 4879.53s]  Okay. I'm going to start in. What do we even need to do? We have to. The couch is the only
[4879.53s -> 4883.29s]  thing to do right now, unless there's trash. Is there like a trash room? No, there's a
[4883.61s -> 4886.97s]  trash bucket at the bottom, right? We need to take the wallpaper off in this room.
[4886.97s -> 4901.48s]  How do like, I'm not even mentally present. All right. Trash it up. Oh, we have to move
[4901.48s -> 4904.84s]  that couch because it's blocking the door where the deliveries come. All right. What are we doing
[4904.84s -> 4916.02s]  with this? I'm going to dump this. It won't let me. I'm going to get any more trash I need to pull
[4916.02s -> 4921.72s]  up. I don't think so. So bring that. We need to paste the walls. Leave it on the front porch.
[4922.36s -> 4929.62s]  I'll get it later. Don't make me sign for concrete. Throw that glue over here. Which
[4929.62s -> 4940.04s]  one of these rooms needs to be purple? Where's the blueprint? Okay. Purple is probably. Check
[4940.04s -> 4949.93s]  blueprint. I got it. Purple's left. So this room has to be this room here. The bottom left is
[4949.93s -> 4957.54s]  striped. Bottom left is striped and this is just paint. Dude, can you guys deliver it all at once
[4957.54s -> 4963.22s]  next time? Or I'm going to, I don't, what am I doing? You're accepting deliveries. You're doing
[4963.22s -> 4967.38s]  a great job. What do I do now that I've accepted the deliveries? Now what you're going to do is
[4967.38s -> 4971.30s]  you're going to do, go to the, you're going to get the glue. You're going to fill a, this bucket
[4971.30s -> 4975.54s]  next to me. All right. Get that paint bucket up at the top and then go to the bottom right room.
[4976.82s -> 4983.06s]  Take that and fill that with glue. And then you're going to slack the bottom left and then shrink
[4983.06s -> 4999.77s]  it and then don't come to work tomorrow. Honestly, that's all very doable. Are we done with the
[4999.77s -> 5009.03s]  paint? I think we're done with the paint. Is this room supposed to be purple carpet? That's supposed
[5009.03s -> 5018.79s]  to be green paint on the walls in the lower right. Lower left is shellac and where's the carpet go?
[5018.79s -> 5024.71s]  Yes. You're correct with what you're describing. I'm going to, you didn't mix, you didn't even do it.
[5025.43s -> 5029.83s]  I didn't, I didn't do it. There's a lot of cleaning up. There's ice. I had to get two deliveries.
[5030.63s -> 5035.27s]  You just throw me under the bus after I had to walk uphill in the ice both ways to get to the
[5035.27s -> 5040.31s]  front door. I actually did. I actually did though. Fucking goddamn fucking idiot. Fucking stupid.
[5040.31s -> 5052.70s]  Fucking goddamn. All right. You ready? I didn't do this job before, so I don't.
[5057.03s -> 5066.06s]  Oh, this burst is too big. No, it's just trashed. I'm wearing one of those tacky
[5066.06s -> 5076.41s]  tourist outfits for Halloween. Okay, shellac. It looks like an inflatable. I'll clean this up.
[5078.74s -> 5084.02s]  All right. Okay. Can you help me paste the walls and I will put the wallpaper over the paste?
[5086.26s -> 5091.96s]  I don't have anything I can do, so I'm just going to clean. Star, you've made a real mess about
[5091.96s -> 5099.32s]  time. Pick up the paste. No, I need that. Okay. Sure. This room is so tiny and shitty.
[5101.94s -> 5106.98s]  All right. How about you can't target the things you want to do. Can somebody come?
[5108.34s -> 5112.34s]  Star, where are you going with that? Shut up. You're supposed to be pasting. I'm cleaning.
[5112.34s -> 5120.04s]  I'm cleaning this fucking room. Hey, you don't just put it in another spot. I'm ready.
[5121.00s -> 5127.72s]  Okay. You need me to paint. Yeah, I need you to do the paste. What do you think you're doing
[5127.72s -> 5145.50s]  down there? We're going to have to get a saline IV going in you. My brain doesn't work this late
[5145.50s -> 5149.74s]  in the day. This is like two more. I should have been bed an hour. Hey, hey, hey. What? There's
[5149.74s -> 5156.54s]  two more? This is not trash? Yep. What are you doing? I need that spit in your mouth like you
[5156.54s -> 5161.34s]  want me to do to you. Hey, can you come back and paste these? Where are you going? Why are you
[5161.34s -> 5168.14s]  running in a circle with a blueprint? I was getting it out and I was avoiding something in front of
[5168.14s -> 5179.18s]  you. Okay. Top two only. All right. Ready? 23 seconds. Get out of the way. Get out of the room.
[5179.18s -> 5189.26s]  Just get out of the room. You're just messing it all up. Go. Clean it. Okay. I got it.
[5200.34s -> 5209.11s]  I swear you were an obstacle for that level. There was a moving block that was just getting
[5209.11s -> 5231.35s]  in the way. 2.9 stars. That's fine. I tried my best. We haven't done this one. No. That was a
[5231.35s -> 5237.51s]  big one. That was a big one. That was a big one. This game needs a scoreboard. You know, I don't
[5237.51s -> 5249.16s]  like the snow levels. If that's supposed to be me, you're doing a very good job. Oh, wait. This is
[5249.16s -> 5256.90s]  a three-parter. Okay. We got purple carpets, strike purple walls, and then we need special
[5256.90s -> 5267.90s]  blue walls. Yeah. Wallpaper. I'll take that. Thank you. What do we have to do? I'll take care
[5267.90s -> 5273.66s]  of this. You guys wait for another delivery. Just hang out and talk. I need that puke bucket.
[5280.73s -> 5291.45s]  What do I have to talk to italics about? Yeah, right. Star Wars or something. Don't knock that
[5291.45s -> 5295.13s]  over. Don't knock that over. Don't dare. He probably likes the last Jedi, so it's okay.
[5296.01s -> 5302.57s]  I do not. Oh, boy. Oh, there you go. Oh, boy. Name a game that I like that came out like the last
[5302.57s -> 5312.79s]  five years. Name a game. Dwarf game. Dwarf game? Yeah. Dwarf Miner shooting game. That game was
[5312.79s -> 5326.20s]  okay. He did it. Yeah, you like that. I'm going to get that delivery, please. Minecraft. Did Minecraft
[5326.20s -> 5334.20s]  come out in the last five years? Yeah, I think so. Like 1.0. We got to get glue going in the top
[5334.20s -> 5342.84s]  left. Not before we have all the trash removed up here. That's not trash. Don't dare come in here
[5342.84s -> 5349.96s]  and start doing things. Is this not the purple carpet room? No, it is. Sorry. I really flew up
[5349.96s -> 5354.28s]  the handle there. Sorry about that. I just threw it in the garbage. All right. Now we can put paste
[5354.28s -> 5365.51s]  in here. Okay, we need to paste the top left room and we need to paste the bottom left room
[5365.51s -> 5370.71s]  different colors. That's like all we have, I think. Is there anything else to do? Let's check.
[5371.59s -> 5378.09s]  Carpet. There's only going to be one paste, so we can only do one room at a time. Yeah. Yep.
[5379.13s -> 5384.09s]  So one person is non-essential. So I'm just going to, you know, I'll not be the obstacle this time.
[5384.09s -> 5390.74s]  I just don't want to get yelled at. All right, we'll do this room first. I mean, you could just
[5390.82s -> 5395.72s]  put the paste in your mouth and just spit it into the wall and then do it. It wouldn't be too hard.
[5395.72s -> 5400.84s]  All right, let's start in the big corner. You know what? If you guys need to rotate, call in
[5400.84s -> 5405.40s]  the AC 130. Listen, this paste holds the wallpaper in place. If you put it in your mouth, maybe it'll
[5405.40s -> 5423.05s]  hold your lips in place. Alex, what are you doing? Are you happy with anyone?
[5423.93s -> 5433.06s]  I'm just sitting out there. You're sitting out there like the newspaper rolled up.
[5433.70s -> 5436.98s]  How do you live with him? You're trying to, you're trying to like,
[5438.49s -> 5448.52s]  wait, uh-oh, there's a little hoopsie over here. Wait, where are you going? I have to throw this
[5448.52s -> 5457.45s]  away because we have to use that bucket of paste and AFK player is just outside. I explained that
[5457.45s -> 5462.49s]  there is nothing for me to do. You know what? I did read that this game doesn't scale based on how
[5462.49s -> 5467.29s]  many people you're playing with, so it's not any easier or harder. There, I gave you something to
[5467.29s -> 5482.23s]  do. Okay, thank you. Which wall are we on? Thank you for any of them. What just happened?
[5485.37s -> 5494.98s]  Why is this trash now? What? Uh, I think you put the, I don't know. It must've gotten empty.
[5494.98s -> 5500.82s]  We got two men. Okay, we got playing time. Oh my God. You haven't even done this one room yet.
[5504.58s -> 5514.38s]  So paste. Let's go. There you go. Now put it on the wall. Don't look at me. Nice work.
[5515.10s -> 5527.94s]  We have just got to stuff in the corner and that's it for this one, right? You need to glue this
[5527.94s -> 5534.47s]  entire room down here with that. Okay. And then that's it. Well, how about you do that? There's
[5534.47s -> 5541.59s]  the glue. And I'll tidy up. I mean, I just want you, I want you to participate. So I'll fill it
[5541.67s -> 5552.09s]  up for you. Ready? See? There we go. Now I'm going to move over here and I'm going to be ready.
[5552.09s -> 5566.78s]  Wait, I'm, hold on. I'm working overtime here. Sorry. I took your job there. Uh, can we get a
[5566.78s -> 5574.31s]  rotate champ? What is that? Hey, champ, can you give us a rotate? He wants you to go pick up the
[5574.31s -> 5582.14s]  thing and move the thing, pick up the thing and move it. Oh, turn the camera. Thanks champ. You
[5582.14s -> 5593.53s]  guys need it again. Let me know. I think we're going to need it again here in a second, champ.
[5595.45s -> 5602.14s]  What are you doing? All right. Let's tidy up. All right. Everybody back it up. That's a day's work
[5602.94s -> 5608.66s]  all in a day's work. You fucking guys are so bad at this game. Like I'm missing dinner now.
[5609.46s -> 5620.12s]  How do you still have that from so long ago? That's so, you know what? I hope in a hundred
[5620.12s -> 5626.84s]  years, somebody digs up your XLR or whatever it is and plays that. It'll, it'll be on there.
[5628.28s -> 5635.19s]  Oh, we're not good enough. We need three more stars. Well, we can go back to floor one. Yes.
[5635.19s -> 5639.35s]  We were terrible. That's true. We could get, we did miss at least two plus stars.
[5641.83s -> 5650.98s]  Oh, these are, these are going to be the real baby hours. 10,000 years from now. That's the
[5650.98s -> 5656.90s]  only evidence of humanity. Don't alt tab is what I've learned. Why? Cause it like, if you're doing
[5656.90s -> 5661.62s]  this broadcast thing, it like freezes your feet. Oh yeah. This is, look at how dog shit this is.
[5662.10s -> 5669.30s]  One star. This is my bedtime. Did you know that? What? For third, five 30. It's five. Yeah.
[5669.86s -> 5676.82s]  On the West coast, but over here, it's six 30. It's so no, hold on. No, it's five 30 there.
[5676.82s -> 5679.86s]  All right. What do we have to do? Guys, we're supposed to get three stars. I'm looking at
[5679.86s -> 5686.90s]  the clock. It's, it's actually six 30 here. Oh yeah. It's, it's weird. It's still very early.
[5687.86s -> 5695.77s]  What time do you wake up? Like noon. You go to bed at six 30. You wake up at noon.
[5698.01s -> 5704.78s]  He's got six good hours a day. I was, I was going to say that's like left to yellow, not orange,
[5705.50s -> 5712.52s]  orange bottom. Looks like kicked it. All right. We start pulling stuff up. I'll get the trash.
[5713.32s -> 5720.89s]  I'll get this door. Grab that back to this. Back is the question. How did we manage to one star this
[5721.53s -> 5726.09s]  because this is still, this is one star. Didn't know how to X what's going on here.
[5726.97s -> 5743.91s]  Someone get the door, please. All right. We got this here. Any more trash, all the stuff on the
[5743.91s -> 5751.86s]  floor. Can I have that? Okay. Put it right in the door. Nice. How did we manage to one star this
[5751.86s -> 5771.69s]  Mr. Disruption? All right. Yeah. You just do it. It'll be easier. I think close the door. It'll
[5771.69s -> 5779.26s]  probably help. No, it's the door. Yeah. I'll just apparently we got paint. We got paint. Get the
[5779.26s -> 5790.02s]  paint. We got paint. Go get the paint. Let me go. Oh, this is not. Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding
[5790.02s -> 5804.38s]  me. Just trade you. Okay. All right. We got orange paint here. We need, we need that trash bucket
[5804.38s -> 5809.90s]  again. We need the trash bucket. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. Oh, you get it. You're going
[5809.90s -> 5821.58s]  down there already. You're closest. Doss it over here. I wonder how we didn't do this for the last
[5821.58s -> 5829.35s]  time. There's two minutes, but you calm down. I didn't say anything. I just replayed that part of
[5829.35s -> 5835.27s]  the screen. You fucking guys are so bad at this game. He didn't get a go XLR sponsor. So he just
[5835.27s -> 5843.88s]  has to do it for like by his memory. Have you even used that in its board's intended purpose?
[5844.84s -> 5850.04s]  What is its intended purpose? I thought it was for you to that wasn't what the joke was that you
[5850.04s -> 5856.46s]  play that while you were like mad at Overwatch. Oh, well, no. Back in the day, I was using it to
[5856.46s -> 5860.94s]  record other people who were mad at Overwatch. Right. So I gave you a I'm mad at Overwatch clip
[5860.94s -> 5868.81s]  and you haven't used it. I did use it during that was like a long time ago. We don't get three stars.
[5868.89s -> 5883.77s]  Okay. Can you peel this? Thank you. Now on your way out, just scoop that up on your way out.
[5883.77s -> 5888.23s]  Scoop. Did you not shut the door? Thank you. What are we missing?
[5891.13s -> 5906.70s]  What are we missing? We only have 42 seconds. We have 40 seconds. What? Are we stupid? The kitchen.
[5908.10s -> 5919.80s]  The kitchen wall? I don't see anywhere. Did we paint the wrong room? No. Tiny wall.
[5921.93s -> 5925.05s]  Can we get that paint that we're not going to get three stars. Where's the tiny wall?
[5928.94s -> 5942.65s]  Oh, I see it. Oh, I see it too. Oh, wow. Okay. Good.
[5949.45s -> 5956.09s]  It's two minutes. We got plenty of time. Yeah. We missed one, one fourth of a wall.
[5969.26s -> 5979.64s]  Quickly now. We got this. We learned nothing. Yeah. I know. I hope so. Well, at least no one can say
[5979.64s -> 5993.88s]  this is going well anymore. You know, that doesn't help very much because I have to set it down.
[5994.84s -> 6004.62s]  Shut up. I just now I'm looking at you with a shocked. Whoa. What the heck? I just threw a
[6004.62s -> 6010.79s]  bucket. It's like into like through a roof for you. That doesn't help very much. It's like,
[6011.91s -> 6021.72s]  where's the awe? What do you mean? Oh, like, isn't like, oh, oh, why would there be an awe?
[6022.44s -> 6029.08s]  No, like shock and awe, not like, oh, oh, I thought you meant like, I threw that bucket in for you.
[6029.08s -> 6042.65s]  Oh, you did that for me? No. Well, thanks anyways, though. Shock and awe. Well, you spelled something
[6042.65s -> 6056.22s]  over here. I did that. No, I. What button is it? Oh, I got it. Well, she's a real jack.
[6057.27s -> 6061.67s]  All right. We got plenty of time now. Seriously, like you didn't even paint this one wall.
[6062.23s -> 6069.08s]  Come on. This is where this is where we start making mistakes. No, you got the paint. I'm
[6069.08s -> 6077.72s]  going to get this trash. I'm bringing the mango ice cream. You may want to get the bucket that's
[6077.72s -> 6082.60s]  outside because I'm just. Well, it's all right. It's all right. You guys just can handle that.
[6082.60s -> 6095.14s]  I can handle it. All right. We get we got the small wall right off the bat. But good, good,
[6095.14s -> 6105.54s]  good. I hope I never see this level again. I hope I do. In fact, we might because there's still
[6105.54s -> 6110.10s]  another wall. Let me help you. Ninety five. I got it. I got it. I got it. Stop.
[6110.10s -> 6119.85s]  Stop. If we're just trying to go and do something and then the whole world rotates.
[6121.34s -> 6133.32s]  What's left? Would you guys leave up here? When did you leave this three left? Hold on. Wait,
[6133.32s -> 6137.08s]  hang on. It's well, there's only one thing left. Let me rotate the whole world.
[6137.96s -> 6144.84s]  Rotate the world. Rotate the world. Please don't do this to me. How does this keep happening?
[6144.92s -> 6154.34s]  Where is it? Trash outside. Does that count? Does it? It does. It does count. The trash on the
[6154.90s -> 6160.36s]  porch. All right. Do we have enough with thirty two? We need one more star.
[6162.18s -> 6168.34s]  We need a single. Yes, just one. Let's do level one. Level one. Level one.
[6169.99s -> 6179.13s]  This game's got a lot of replay ability. All right. I bet you could do this by yourself.
[6182.26s -> 6188.87s]  That's it. It just needs a pink wall. I think you know how much you've grown
[6191.59s -> 6194.47s]  in just a short amount of time. We didn't. We couldn't figure this out in
[6195.27s -> 6198.63s]  more than three foldments. It doesn't tell you the buttons.
[6200.20s -> 6210.07s]  How many furries does it take to paint a wall? As many as you want. One could do it probably in
[6210.63s -> 6218.94s]  a week if you skidded it kind of casually. What I want to know is how we finished it but
[6218.94s -> 6228.90s]  didn't get three stars. I see. That's how I think that might answer your question.
[6231.77s -> 6243.75s]  How much spill is there? It's a never ending spill. How did that? I pressed A to drop it
[6243.75s -> 6254.50s]  and it spilled. All right. We can continue and do the progression into the elevator.
[6254.50s -> 6262.01s]  We're about to unlock a new character, guys. What is it? I want to be an F-16 jet.
[6267.18s -> 6278.15s]  Oh. One too high. How could we all be facing the wrong direction? All right. We go this way. Wait.
[6278.87s -> 6291.61s]  To the left and then up. Oh. Unlocking number 13. Uh oh. Uh oh.
[6294.30s -> 6301.37s]  This is a real hotel. There wouldn't even be a number 13. What the hell are we supposed to do here?
[6302.73s -> 6310.73s]  I'm finding that info out. We are supposed to be... Oh, it's a mixy match. Yeah, it's a... And
[6310.73s -> 6316.74s]  there's slits and there's couches. Good thing we have plenty of time. Is there even a bucket?
[6317.62s -> 6326.58s]  Where's a bucket? We have nothing. There's no bucket. Oh, there's that bucket. Pretty brushes
[6326.58s -> 6334.18s]  to the door. Is it for me? Does it have my name on it? Okay, you joke but that's real life.
[6335.14s -> 6343.67s]  Which package is the opt? I have experienced that here in this house. Yeah, we just have to
[6344.63s -> 6358.31s]  peel off the stuff one by one. What a great treat, you know, for holidays to just do
[6359.27s -> 6364.10s]  repetitive tasks with your friends. That's what Christmas is all about.
[6365.46s -> 6368.02s]  Some of my favorite games are games where I just have to like paint a house.
[6368.98s -> 6379.45s]  Unironically, House Flipper is one of my favorite video games. You just like suck up bugs and
[6379.45s -> 6389.78s]  vacuum cleaners and stuff. You just clean up a house and shit. Viscer cleanup detail. That's
[6389.78s -> 6396.94s]  one of my favorite games. You just clean a house. I'm seeing a pattern. So would you say like the
[6396.94s -> 6402.79s]  big game companies are trying too hard and they just need to make like house cleaners? And that's
[6402.87s -> 6408.47s]  the next genre. Like it was like Minecraft, like Survival, Battle Royale, Cleaner. Yes.
[6409.19s -> 6413.27s]  Is next. Yes. I don't know. Are they trying too hard or are they not trying hard enough?
[6415.19s -> 6418.23s]  If there was like a hundred million dollar budget House Flipper type game,
[6419.11s -> 6425.85s]  I would, that's all I would do. And it's like an MMO and you get to flip your houses to other
[6425.85s -> 6431.37s]  gamers and then they get to live in the house. All right, are you painting the right walls here?
[6432.01s -> 6436.49s]  I painted one wall and it was the right wall. I'm just going to keep this up.
[6438.41s -> 6445.85s]  No, because then we can't. No, it just alternates. So how hard is it to alternate? I don't know.
[6445.85s -> 6475.38s]  Somebody, what about the walls we can't see? Listen, if our eyes are real. Okay. Okay. Got it.
[6475.38s -> 6480.50s]  Okay. Okay. Mirrors be real. I'm going to do a rotate. Is everyone ready for a rotate?
[6481.30s -> 6491.85s]  25 seconds. All right. Go. Somebody didn't kill this paint off. How are we ever going to get
[6492.73s -> 6498.65s]  you say someone didn't kill this paint off, which is like just an accusatory way. Like none of us
[6498.65s -> 6502.97s]  did it. It could have been someone didn't. It could have been me. Yeah. That's all right.
[6502.97s -> 6508.09s]  What do we do? Someone didn't get the door. No one. Do we do? You're trying to put the blame on
[6508.09s -> 6512.73s]  one or purple purple. Yeah. I'm trying to put the blame on one person. It could have been me.
[6512.73s -> 6518.65s]  I'm that one person that could have been me. That's no, that sounds like backtracking from
[6518.65s -> 6522.49s]  your PR department. No, no, that's some somebody didn't do this. We need to rotate.
[6523.45s -> 6534.01s]  I'm going to start cleaning up. Is there anything to clean up? You see one more purple wall, right?
[6536.28s -> 6544.30s]  Is that account for like, well, we're not even done. Our progress is not good. Are you sure?
[6544.30s -> 6549.02s]  I knew it was reversed. You were so sure though. I was. What do you mean reverse?
[6549.18s -> 6564.58s]  Yeah, these are wrong. I was so sure. What? But yeah, yeah, I fucked us. Oh, I fucked us all.
[6564.58s -> 6571.29s]  It's almost as if having the blueprint. One of us made a mistake here. One of us. Somebody
[6571.29s -> 6579.61s]  did something wrong. Not sure who it was, but one of us. Somebody made a mistake. I think then this
[6579.77s -> 6591.38s]  I think then this wall is also wrong. 94. I'll spit it. Got to be purple. Purple on the empty
[6591.38s -> 6596.34s]  spot on the left. If anybody wants to move, you could do it. No, I'll get it. It's fine.
[6596.34s -> 6616.66s]  Oh, you got it. Get those paint cans. One, two. Yeah. Three stars. Listen, if we got personal
[6616.66s -> 6626.41s]  scores, mine would be highest. That's I don't mean that's a koala. Hey, that last one on the
[6626.41s -> 6635.08s]  end. Is that exoskeleton buglionian boy? I want to be the outline. You can't just have the new one
[6635.08s -> 6643.10s]  every single time. Yes, I can. All right. Let's just make it confusing. We'll all be koalas. No,
[6643.10s -> 6651.59s]  no, no, no, no, no. All koalas the same color. Star. I know. As I said, my body type is an otter.
[6651.59s -> 6658.31s]  I can't be the one you are. Oh, you can't be the same one. Oh yeah. I can be any other one though.
[6660.17s -> 6674.31s]  You're just confusing people. All right. I'll be the dog again. Fine. I'll be this one.
[6674.95s -> 6686.02s]  I'll look at the vanity here. We need 37 to go up that floor, by the way. Of course.
[6686.82s -> 6695.08s]  Oh, there's a door open. Oh, there is? Oh yeah, there is. Number 14. We need 37 stars to reach
[6695.08s -> 6700.98s]  this floor. Why does it keep? Oh, that's to go up to the next one. Correct. Yes.
[6701.78s -> 6713.93s]  All right. Cool. What we got? Oh, this is a really nice island. Did you know that koalas
[6713.93s -> 6718.57s]  are really close to extinction? We don't have blueprint. Yeah, I was actually told this.
[6719.91s -> 6726.55s]  Maybe if they all just got jobs helping people move into their new homes like this koala.
[6728.02s -> 6734.42s]  What? Just start taking taking off the wallpaper because it's going to ask us to. Yeah. Oh no,
[6734.42s -> 6738.18s]  actually from what I was told and I did a little research myself, koalas have smooth brains
[6738.98s -> 6744.10s]  and they will not eat food if it's on a table. They don't get it. It's not like on the tree.
[6744.10s -> 6748.74s]  So they don't they will literally starve to death if you feed them their koala food on a table.
[6751.56s -> 6756.92s]  And apparently they like have they just have sex with each other so much that they just I'm
[6756.92s -> 6764.50s]  no this is not even a joke. Like there's so many like koala STDs. Did you learn any of those
[6764.50s -> 6771.10s]  meerkat facts? Why is this going outside? I don't know. I just felt like the appropriate place to
[6771.10s -> 6777.66s]  put it. I was just following your lead. All right. So what's the plan? Where is the plan?
[6778.62s -> 6782.62s]  The plan's in the dumpster. It looks like the plan's in the dumpster. I don't think we have a
[6782.62s -> 6788.14s]  plan. I think we might be waiting for a delivery either that or we just need to like trial and
[6788.14s -> 6794.22s]  error and that would be really fun. Oh boy. Okay. Well, do we have an info? Yeah. I'm going to
[6794.22s -> 6798.86s]  imagine that we glue these to this wall. I'm just going to, I'm going to, well, it looks like, yeah,
[6798.86s -> 6802.94s]  that's what the game wants you to do. We actually probably need to glue them to the top left wall.
[6803.66s -> 6806.46s]  I think that's the only thing we have, but what about the purple paint?
[6808.73s -> 6817.10s]  All right. Try top left. I'm going to try purple paint here. Oh, is it carpet? All right. Purple
[6817.10s -> 6832.84s]  top left. Okay. Let's give it a try. Progress is zero. I got progress for this. You got progress
[6832.84s -> 6838.20s]  for that. This is probably bottom left. Yeah, this is definitely bottom left. All right. So what
[6838.20s -> 6842.92s]  would be top left? The green? The carpet? No, where's the carpet go? We probably don't have
[6842.92s -> 6859.46s]  the ingredient yet. There it is. Yeah, that's top left. Let's try that. Hey, it worked. Look at us
[6859.46s -> 6868.31s]  solving this difficult puzzle. It is a puzzle. Now, if only they put like another
[6868.31s -> 6877.59s]  couple million into the budget of this game. I'm not kidding. If there was a game where you did
[6877.59s -> 6882.79s]  this, but it was not just like a fun little co-op game. No, no, no. Like you had to build a whole
[6882.79s -> 6890.38s]  house. How much was this game? $20. Okay. Only one of us had to buy it. That's true.
[6891.10s -> 6903.34s]  Okay. Considering that this is like $7 per person. Honestly, this game has... Oh no, I can't say that.
[6903.90s -> 6910.68s]  Never mind. Are you getting progress by doing that? Have you checked? Yeah. Okay. Good. Okay.
[6910.68s -> 6915.56s]  Just checking. Good. Good. Good. Good. Very good. I'm going to start trashing the walls over here.
[6917.38s -> 6933.46s]  I'm going to start throwing up. Why? Missing a wall in the top left room. We probably should spin it
[6933.46s -> 6942.41s]  to be honest. Honestly, you want to be really honest? Let's just... We can't spin it. Oh no,
[6942.41s -> 6946.89s]  we can't spin it because there's no blueprint. There is no blueprint. Oh shit. Okay. So we have
[6946.89s -> 6955.00s]  to... Get some pace. Do we have all the trash from this bottom left room? Oh, these bottom walls.
[6958.92s -> 6962.12s]  Also, don't koalas eat eucalyptus leaves, which is like poisonous.
[6963.58s -> 6970.52s]  Are you still on the koalas? No, no. Yeah. That's their main source of food is eucalyptus.
[6970.60s -> 6975.64s]  It's poison. But over years and decades, their stomachs have been able to digest it.
[6976.44s -> 6985.86s]  So we're doing... What? We need to do this bottom left room with the teal paper. Glue.
[6986.98s -> 6995.53s]  Hey, thank you Utopia Fox. Utopia Fox. Utopia Fox. For the five community subs. Thank you.
[6995.53s -> 7004.44s]  Utopia Fox. Thank you. You guys, are we getting progress on that? Yeah. All right. I'm going to
[7004.44s -> 7008.20s]  start cleaning. Are we getting progress on that? We have a room in the top left. We need the purple
[7008.20s -> 7022.10s]  wallpaper to be up there. Oops. I skipped one. This music sounds like Civilization 5 music.
[7023.06s -> 7028.74s]  Koalas can't eat eucalyptus at birth because they lack the proper enzymes.
[7028.74s -> 7031.86s]  They have to obtain the enzymes by eating their mother's poop.
[7033.30s -> 7040.18s]  Oh. What if they're like... What if they don't have a mother?
[7044.36s -> 7047.72s]  That's them. They were immaculately conceived and we might have missed
[7047.72s -> 7051.08s]  Jesus Koala at some point. No. No. There was a lab involved.
[7052.28s -> 7058.84s]  What are you doing? Thank you, Utopia Fox. Go get the fucking paper. I'm talking. All right.
[7058.84s -> 7064.04s]  Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have a koala. Standing in the middle of the floor, not helping anyone.
[7064.60s -> 7071.88s]  What do koalas make for a noise? 27 seconds left, might I add, looking up Koala facts in his chat.
[7071.88s -> 7076.68s]  I think all you've done is move the thing further away. What do they do? Start cleaning up.
[7076.68s -> 7078.36s]  Oh, sorry. There's a wall missing.
[7079.32s -> 7083.08s]  Jera must just stand in the middle of the floor and I'm getting called out for helping you.
[7083.08s -> 7090.25s]  I don't know who is who. You all changed. Can I eat this? Oh, we do have four seconds left.
[7090.25s -> 7097.56s]  I'm sorry. Oh, yeah. Four seconds left. Oh my God. Now I can't. This guy. He went to college.
[7098.44s -> 7104.28s]  You keep bringing that up. Hey, not all of us are in the top 1% of the educated
[7104.28s -> 7114.60s]  elite that go to college for this shit. Oh, you're going to talk down to me now.
[7115.56s -> 7125.27s]  Hey, quiet, quiet. Did you say college boy? Yeah, college boy. Hey, college boy.
[7126.07s -> 7130.92s]  Are you my father on our weekly Sunday phone call when I was in college? Being considered a college
[7130.92s -> 7140.26s]  boy is a step up from being a boomer like usual. These walls need to come off. That door needs to
[7140.26s -> 7148.23s]  be answered. We have a blueprint this time. Which one are you now, Jerma? Are you the other? You're
[7148.23s -> 7156.06s]  the koala. I'm the koala. I've been the dog for like four missions. OK, that's supposed to mean
[7156.06s -> 7160.54s]  something to me. What do we do with the bag of flour? What do we do with a locked bag of flour?
[7160.54s -> 7165.10s]  There's a lot of locked ingredients. I've heard you're supposed to drink it and don't come into
[7165.10s -> 7179.14s]  work tomorrow. Oh, I have heard that too. Someone very wise said that. OK, this is our ingredient
[7179.14s -> 7186.42s]  room. Top left is that carpet that you just put down. Top left is that carpet. Which one?
[7186.42s -> 7192.58s]  Fuchsia? That one. That one. You got it. You got it. I'm doing it. You guys take care of that shit.
[7192.58s -> 7194.74s]  Do we have any more trash that needs to be peeled off walls?
[7196.02s -> 7207.30s]  I don't think so. Do we have a mix yet? There's a bag of that mix stuff in that right room.
[7209.96s -> 7221.21s]  Now, whatever that's for, I don't know. Oh, what's the box? Did I do this wrong?
[7221.93s -> 7224.41s]  What's this box? I don't know. I just have an indicator over here.
[7227.32s -> 7235.14s]  Take this box to the rightmost room. Hold on. You want this box over there? Yeah, that little...
[7237.70s -> 7241.54s]  Just you get it. It's right there. Can you knock it out now?
[7242.50s -> 7248.42s]  Hold on. I just got to put that... Oh, these are like the wall tiles. OK, I get it.
[7249.06s -> 7252.74s]  Here you go. We have to do the same thing, though. It dries. I need a second person.
[7253.62s -> 7256.10s]  I'm almost done here. Then I'll be in there with you, Chief.
[7256.98s -> 7261.22s]  I'm going to paint this top left room. You guys take care of that. Sounds good to me.
[7262.68s -> 7269.98s]  I'm with you, Chief. What do you need me to do? Just pick up the box stuff and then put it on the...
[7274.34s -> 7284.28s]  Oh, yeah. OK, Chief. It's one word catchphrase stuff.
[7289.03s -> 7296.98s]  Whoops. That was not... The top left room is done. I don't think we need this fuchsia paint anymore,
[7296.98s -> 7304.06s]  do we? I don't think so. I'm going to give you... You guys need to turn? Oh, yeah.
[7306.57s -> 7311.67s]  Yeah, that's it. After that, you guys are done after that. Then I'm just going to start cleaning
[7311.67s -> 7319.08s]  up. That's a three star. What do I have? I think I have tiles. You do have tiles.
[7328.55s -> 7332.31s]  There we go. He makes it up at the end. There's just some construction puke over here.
[7337.18s -> 7347.59s]  There's that one bundle. You want to put it on that final wall. Oh, oh. Oh, shit, dude. Oh, shit.
[7370.10s -> 7375.70s]  Jesus. Am I watching a college drinking compilation where somebody chugs real fast?
[7375.70s -> 7380.18s]  What are you doing? Get out here. Get outside. There's a minute. Put me down.
[7380.18s -> 7391.96s]  Just recording our royalty free party on beyond sound effects. You good? What if you say college,
[7391.96s -> 7406.62s]  boy? You guys have to finish that wall. I'm getting to it, dad. There's still one more thing. So
[7406.62s -> 7412.60s]  could we get some rotations? It's this door. No. You need rotations? Oh, there's another wall.
[7412.60s -> 7433.46s]  Right here. Right here. Right here. On me. There it is. Just you two? Yeah. Damn. Pretty
[7433.46s -> 7439.78s]  good. Nice work, guys. We need 37. Hey, good job. We don't even get paid for this.
[7443.26s -> 7455.75s]  How many floors are there? Well, the achievement was 999. 199. No, 999. This game is a testament
[7455.75s -> 7461.11s]  that a couple of, you know, a couple of farm boys can work with one city slicker.
[7462.55s -> 7466.31s]  You know what I'm talking about? We had trouble saying that for some reason. Why? Now we can
[7466.31s -> 7471.27s]  work together with the social elite. I think it's actually the opposite because I went to college.
[7472.44s -> 7478.20s]  So it's two college boys trying to teach one farm boy how to actually do things. We can't get this
[7478.20s -> 7484.95s]  out of this room. Free education. We have to move it around. Does the queen live here?
[7485.67s -> 7490.34s]  Where are you trying to move this? Just out of the way so we can start to do this.
[7490.90s -> 7495.70s]  It's in the way now. It's in the way. It is in the way now. I'll just restart.
[7501.19s -> 7506.15s]  We have. Yeah, this is going to be a pain in the ass. Just rotate it so we can walk by.
[7507.51s -> 7514.15s]  There. Diagonally. Diagonal. Diagonal. Stop going through the door. You're pushing.
[7515.99s -> 7520.31s]  All right. Let it leave there. Wow. Look at those two college boys work together on that one.
[7521.82s -> 7528.34s]  That's this floor up here. So that's it's already been shellacked.
[7529.06s -> 7543.94s]  There's no shellac. So just do it. Just click their heads. We need some couch movement I think
[7543.94s -> 7552.79s]  here in a minute. If anyone touches this couch, I'm screaming. There's one behind the top right
[7552.79s -> 7558.28s]  and the top left. If you touch this couch. Oh my god. Someone get the fucking door.
[7560.25s -> 7563.13s]  You have to scream twice as loud because we've both touched different ones.
[7566.79s -> 7570.63s]  Yeah, good metallic. Seriously, that's like a that's like a we like looked over and like
[7570.71s -> 7574.31s]  wink. You know what I mean? I want to hear the scream. That was a that we need to double scream
[7574.31s -> 7583.59s]  now. Boy, that was very bad. That was very bad. That was very bad. I'm sorry. It's my bedtime.
[7586.01s -> 7590.09s]  He can't scream because everybody in that city goes to sleep at six p.m. That wasn't even a
[7590.09s -> 7595.29s]  scream. That was like I just I just swallowed a whole wall. Can we get a blueprint boy out there?
[7595.29s -> 7602.98s]  Carpet right here. Oh, hold on. Doesn't that mean that all these are hidden?
[7602.98s -> 7612.36s]  Yeah, we need to be. This needs to be spun with the blueprint in my god. Oh my god.
[7614.38s -> 7624.46s]  He's joking. Somebody help him. All right. That room's all done. Now, this is for this room then
[7625.10s -> 7633.27s]  the tiles. Are they for the here? No one knows. No one knows. Yep. Tile that room. Wow. Get it
[7633.27s -> 7642.15s]  going. That's a lot of time. Um how do we thank you. That's a lot of time. We have to do. We have
[7642.15s -> 7654.28s]  to move all this stuff. Just do all these ones that are not inefficiency. Just do the ones that
[7654.28s -> 7659.16s]  are already empty that you don't have to move the table twice over. Now, you gotta move the table
[7659.16s -> 7670.76s]  again. Please don't worry. Don't worry about him. K.O. legacy. Thanks for the ten community subs.
[7671.64s -> 7681.34s]  Thank you for the ten subs. A huge drop here. Thank you. Ten fucking subs. Thanks a lot.
[7683.30s -> 7687.54s]  Uh something's on fire. That sounded like thanks a lot but I mean I mean like thanks a lot like
[7687.54s -> 7697.90s]  seriously. I'm sorry. I'm currently being yelled at so sorry. What? This thing's not supposed to
[7697.90s -> 7705.10s]  be up here. Okay. I'm just holding this up in the air while you guys do the tiles underneath it.
[7707.42s -> 7711.34s]  All the lactic acid is built up but I'm gonna like have to scream here in a second.
[7715.99s -> 7722.90s]  Okay. Now, we gotta move the table again after we get this. We gotta get this tile down. I'm going
[7722.90s -> 7730.73s]  for it. Always with the tile on this guy. Did you intentionally lock us back here?
[7731.98s -> 7742.28s]  We're missing tile for the bottom left room that needs to be done with. We don't have the
[7742.28s -> 7747.56s]  tile for it. There's tile in the top right room or something. What is it? Yeah, we need that tile
[7747.56s -> 7754.26s]  in there. Alright, chief. This you need this tile in there with that tile over here. Alright,
[7754.26s -> 7758.26s]  I'm gonna start clearing out. I'm gonna start clearing shit up. Okay. We don't need anymore.
[7759.48s -> 7767.03s]  Alright, chief. I can't wait till you progress. There's a large bed in here. To like buddy or
[7767.11s -> 7773.50s]  like guy or something. Alright, guy. Alright, buddy. What? Did you not hear? You keep just
[7773.50s -> 7780.31s]  changing words. You didn't hear the news? Alright, pull the bed. There's no genders anymore. There's
[7780.31s -> 7790.33s]  only sports. Okay, but pull the bed in such a way that I can get in there. Just place it on this
[7790.33s -> 7801.70s]  front one even though it's gonna block you. I'm trying. I'm gonna crush him. We're actually about
[7801.70s -> 7811.42s]  to throw it over the edge. Alright, there we go. Good. Let me out. I feel like I am playing
[7811.42s -> 7815.90s]  Minecraft again. I went A and K and when I came back, somebody boxed me in with no tools.
[7815.90s -> 7826.09s]  We have to put tiles down in the room. Just lean the bed up into the ceiling. This is ultra lazy.
[7826.97s -> 7831.37s]  You don't want to take the bed apart to clear the room. Alright, we got 50 seconds
[7831.37s -> 7839.19s]  and we're missing something. What are we missing? Kitchen. It might be that. Okay, it didn't drop.
[7840.62s -> 7844.38s]  Okay, we gotta start cleaning up. Oh my, he's getting it. Make room for the bed.
[7848.07s -> 7852.31s]  Can you just come out? Free bed. Free bed. Free bed. Are you seriously not gonna want a free bed?
[7852.95s -> 7865.83s]  Open that door right now. Are we stealing from them? That's just perpetuating, you know.
[7865.83s -> 7872.87s]  That's true. That is stealing. You said we weren't getting paid. That's a fee.
[7873.93s -> 7877.29s]  That moving people are just animal people like otters.
[7877.93s -> 7882.65s]  Now what do we need? This one is large, but I think it's fake large.
[7883.45s -> 7887.90s]  Alright, I think two people could do this one. You know what I mean? Fake large,
[7887.90s -> 7900.28s]  kind of like when I puff out my stomach to look fatter. Yeah. Or just sit normally.
[7905.99s -> 7914.54s]  Alright, what's the goal? Hold on, I don't think he processed it. It's alright. I'm muted right now.
[7914.54s -> 7921.77s]  I don't think he processed that. Tear down these walls. Okay, I gotta compose myself because I
[7921.77s -> 7932.20s]  can't laugh at that. Anyone want to do something? I don't know what the, what are we supposed to
[7932.20s -> 7937.24s]  restart? Tear down these walls. That was really mean. Okay, that's not what I was trying to say.
[7937.24s -> 7944.38s]  Answer the door. Answer the door. Alright, I got pizza. What is this? I think we, I think,
[7944.38s -> 7951.32s]  okay, next game. I think we're done. You do, hey, you do know what the next game is, right?
[7952.60s -> 7956.76s]  The next game is like this game, but different. The next game is like this except it's a train
[7956.76s -> 7968.07s]  instead of a house. Look, you guys are doing nothing. I know. Wait, wait. No,
[7968.07s -> 7973.70s]  I'm not done. I'm not done. Who's done here? Hold on. Who's done here? I was done an hour ago.
[7973.70s -> 7979.94s]  No. Alright. It was my bedtime an hour ago. We started an hour ago. You done? Two hours ago.
[7979.94s -> 7993.51s]  I'm not done. Taleks, you done? No. Alright, majority rules. You have to stay. Okay. Alright,
[7993.59s -> 7998.07s]  these are my, this is my swing vote though. If there's not a new mechanic by the next floor,
[7998.07s -> 8010.14s]  I'm done. Okay. Well, the mechanic, this floor is moving furniture. Oh no, we have,
[8010.14s -> 8014.94s]  but we got a backup thing. Okay, start tearing down these walls. Okay, tear down the walls.
[8015.58s -> 8032.60s]  Get the garbage can that you already put shit in. Oh, it's empty. There. Okay. The train one
[8032.60s -> 8037.64s]  actually, yeah, the train game does look pretty fun. Hey, you guys don't even know what the train
[8037.64s -> 8049.54s]  game is. Do you? I do. I linked it to you. When we want justice, when do we want it now?
[8052.09s -> 8058.25s]  Another backup plan. Okay, so we need to put these tiles on this wall. Everything turned off.
[8059.37s -> 8067.85s]  I, we need, um, different type of wall thing. Is it not here? Where's this carpet go?
[8068.65s -> 8073.69s]  I don't think carpet. I don't think the carpet goes anywhere. It goes in the kitchen.
[8074.25s -> 8082.52s]  This shit goes in the kitchen. What? No, wait. Oh wait. Yeah, it does. I got it. I got it. I got
[8082.52s -> 8087.80s]  it. I got it. Which one's the kitchen floorboard? It's got like a floorboard. Look, is it here?
[8087.80s -> 8094.20s]  Is this a kitchen bringing things? Which is what's the kitchen? So many things. All right.
[8095.16s -> 8102.52s]  Um, I don't know. I think this is a kitchen. Yeah. Wait, that's floorboard. What's this?
[8103.40s -> 8110.78s]  Yeah, that's not that carpet. Doesn't go there. That's the thing you're carrying
[8110.78s -> 8116.78s]  goes in the room. It goes in. Are you sure that's not it? Oh no, that way. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8116.78s -> 8121.34s]  It goes in here. No, it's not. It's wrong. We haven't made any progress. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[8122.22s -> 8124.78s]  Kitchen carpet is right, but the percentage didn't go up.
[8125.98s -> 8138.10s]  Is this right? That's definitely right though. The percentage isn't going up at all. Maybe it's
[8138.10s -> 8147.56s]  because we smell. Uh, did we not tear something off? I mean, that's exactly the way it's supposed
[8147.56s -> 8155.03s]  to look. We didn't shellac. Uh, maybe there's so many things to do that my feeble wall painting
[8155.03s -> 8163.19s]  is not. Yeah, but the individual thing on here would show progress, but it doesn't. This one's
[8163.19s -> 8170.79s]  done blueprint. Are they different? This one's done. I know. Okay. Wait, no, we're going, I guess.
[8170.79s -> 8174.39s]  Oh, they're high. There's one high, one low. There's two different blueprints.
[8175.75s -> 8178.71s]  There's two different blueprints and one of them's false.
[8179.51s -> 8187.98s]  Oh, yeah. Fake blueprints. No, we got fucking tricked. So there is a rival company actively
[8187.98s -> 8192.86s]  trying to sabotage us. What the fuck? Well, that's a new mechanic, but I don't know if I,
[8192.94s -> 8197.98s]  I don't know if I like it. I don't know if I like it. It's just a time waster. You just restart
[8197.98s -> 8203.54s]  at that point and then you play the train gamer. You're like, go to bed. Right. It was frame game
[8203.54s -> 8216.65s]  time. Where's the latte wallpaper was like the latte wallpaper. Do we have latte wallpaper?
[8219.00s -> 8235.85s]  Holy shit, dude. That was, that was violent. What do you, it just sat watching him just keep slipping
[8235.85s -> 8245.02s]  in the back corner. He's just making a mess to try to get us to do the train game.
[8245.02s -> 8253.14s]  He wants to leave. All right. Train game. He wants to. All right. Fine. Fine. This was called
[8253.14s -> 8261.48s]  tools up. So we're going to do train game and I'm going to go to VRB screen and I'm going to go pee
[8262.12s -> 8267.64s]  and then we'll open it up. Just. Oh my God. He pees once every two hours. Not sure. I didn't
[8267.64s -> 8272.54s]  pee for eight hours last night. Last literally last room. I didn't go back in months. All right.
[8272.54s -> 8278.82s]  The first night you haven't wet the bed in the last month, mutable. I don't know. All right. I'm
[8278.82s -> 8282.90s]  going to go pee. What do you mean you don't have train game in you, dude? It's dinner time.
[8285.00s -> 8294.30s]  Why do you guys got to start so late? It's not even late. It was three. It was like four or five
[8294.30s -> 8300.86s]  o'clock. That's late. Then you have to do time zones and then consider what time it is in Europe.
[8300.86s -> 8306.87s]  Do you sleep apnea? No, I've just been waking up really early. No, he just, he just wants to go
[8306.87s -> 8315.78s]  to bed at six thirty seven o'clock at night. That's what it is. Do you go to get the early bird
[8315.78s -> 8325.43s]  special at your local diner too with all the other old people? I wish. All right. I'm going to go pee
[8326.07s -> 8330.95s]  at star. If you're, if you're still with us, then you're still with us. If not have a wonderful
[8330.95s -> 8335.67s]  early word judgment coming from early bird scrambled eggs. It's just going to be a full
[8335.67s -> 8338.39s]  plate of scrambled eggs. You're not going to order anything else. And then you're just going to be
[8338.39s -> 8342.31s]  like, this is what I like. And everyone is going to be like, what the fuck? Why are you doing this?
[8343.11s -> 8354.01s]  You're being really mean right now. Really uncomfortable. All right. All right. Are you
[8354.01s -> 8359.21s]  staying or are you gone? I'm going to look at the game again. I'm going to look at it. All right.
[8359.21s -> 8363.13s]  I'm going to go pee. I'll be right back in two minutes. I have zero brain power at this point in
[8363.13s -> 8372.68s]  the day. Non-canon week. Is this going to be another game where I have to like think?
