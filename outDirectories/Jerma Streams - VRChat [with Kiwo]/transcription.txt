[1.85s -> 9.16s]  People are gonna be real confused when they hear, like, Dark Souls. We're playing Dark Souls tonight, guys.
[10.76s -> 21.85s]  Oh, I need to unmute. Let's just mute this, too. How's everybody doing?
[24.04s -> 36.07s]  Uh, currently in VR chat. Got a special guest tonight, too. We can change everything over here. We don't,
[36.07s -> 48.78s]  why, we don't need an intro. Oh, I'm muted in the game. Oh, shit, hold on. Hey, am I muted still?
[49.34s -> 51.86s]  No, you're good and you're late.
[55.46s -> 71.48s]  Wait, wait, hey, oh, hold on, sorry. Yeah, sorry, I just put my points in. Hi, guys. Are you all good?
[72.04s -> 77.54s]  Are you okay? I think I'm all right. I did put, I did put two points into Dex, though.
[79.62s -> 87.96s]  Dex builds. Almost just fell over already. Make sure, can you, you guys can see. Wait, I have a Dex build.
[89.13s -> 92.57s]  All right, yeah, we're good, we're good, we're good. Why am I using that?
[93.61s -> 103.46s]  So, can we go VR Josh? Kiwo? Kiwo also streaming right now, right? How do I,
[104.10s -> 114.41s]  I got my thumbs up, but not my thumbs. Great avatar. I think I like mine. And this guy?
[114.97s -> 123.85s]  Is he an asset? Can I pick him up? He just sits here. Why is his head so small? Is his head that big
[123.85s -> 135.22s]  in the game? So, I think it's gonna get a little bit weird. I want to warn you now. Yes. Yeah,
[135.22s -> 138.58s]  it's about to get really weird. What's that panic button? Is there a panic button? This is VR chat.
[138.58s -> 142.82s]  Yes, there is a panic button. Let me, so you're gonna have to disable it, but I want to tell you
[142.82s -> 148.34s]  how to disable it first. So, if you go to the safety menu, open your menu, top right safety,
[149.06s -> 153.46s]  you got like all these options. Hold on, you're gonna have to do that one more time? I was looking
[153.46s -> 157.94s]  at your face. Say that one more time? All right. Oh, you're looking at my face. Oh god, they're here.
[159.30s -> 164.98s]  So, hit safety. It's the top right option. Wait, hold on. Don't worry about these people right now.
[165.78s -> 169.62s]  Ignore, ignore. Okay. So, yeah, safety is the top right. You've got all these options.
[170.66s -> 175.38s]  You'll just want to remember to go back to normal, the normal tab on the safety menu when you're
[175.94s -> 180.74s]  done with this. What? You see the normal tab there. Normal? So, if you open the safety,
[180.74s -> 184.74s]  yeah, so if you open safety. I'm on normal right now. There's a maximum normal. Yeah,
[184.74s -> 189.62s]  yeah, no, normal's fine right now. Okay. If you would like to just make everyone go away,
[190.26s -> 196.92s]  you press, you press and hold, I think, let me double check. I think it's both menu button. Yes,
[196.92s -> 202.04s]  okay. So, I don't know if you can still hear me. I think I muted you, but you hit both of the
[202.04s -> 206.68s]  menu buttons above your track pad and both grips on your controllers at the same time.
[207.32s -> 211.48s]  Press and hold them on both and then you should get a warning saying you're in safe mode.
[211.48s -> 214.97s]  Okay. I think I have you muted now. Yeah, let me, let me go back to.
[216.49s -> 221.61s]  Hold everything. And then. So, if you hit the two, the two buttons above, yeah, the two buttons
[221.61s -> 227.21s]  above your touch pad and your grip buttons at the same time, it should go into safe mode.
[227.21s -> 240.66s]  Okay, cool. And then, yeah, so, yeah, both. There we go. Okay. Okay, how do I get out of safe mode?
[242.94s -> 247.99s]  Oh, no, this is just like that episode of Black Mirror. How do I get out of safe mode?
[248.71s -> 261.11s]  I've been blocked by everybody. You don't, you're not in safe mode. How do I get out of safe mode?
[261.11s -> 267.91s]  Can you hear me? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. Right. Go back to normal, right? Okay.
[267.91s -> 273.46s]  Does that work? It should, it should load everything back to normal. All right. Perfect.
[273.46s -> 277.30s]  Yeah, I think we're good. Yeah, give it a second. It might, it might lag out as it loads everyone
[277.30s -> 282.02s]  back in. But yeah, anyway, so if someone shows up with a really bad avatar, which shouldn't happen
[282.02s -> 288.50s]  with our crowd, but if it does happen, just remember safe mode now. All right, well,
[289.38s -> 295.91s]  welcome to VRChat. This is the future. All right, guys, I've never been here before. First time
[295.91s -> 305.22s]  at the VRChat. Welcome, man. Welcome. Welcome. Shaggy. Yeah, want some Scooby Snacks, man?
[305.22s -> 310.50s]  Yeah. Some virtual ones. Are these poisoned? There you go. Is your arm getting tired? There you go.
[310.50s -> 314.26s]  Josh, can you just heal? I'm sorry now. Don't worry about it. Can you die in the game?
[315.91s -> 325.37s]  Yeah, you die for real though. Jump down the well. Some games. Yeah, you can die if you jump down
[325.85s -> 330.81s]  here. Oh, that's the guy from Mass Effect. I need to rest up. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[336.79s -> 349.34s]  Can you die? No, you can't die. By the way, my avatar is just a Play-Doh guy. This character sucks.
[351.10s -> 357.27s]  I'm all right. I'm okay. Can somebody throw a rope? Yeah, so if you want to get back,
[357.27s -> 366.07s]  you can respawn. Open your menu. You're like the paperclip Microsoft guy. You're like,
[366.07s -> 372.10s]  you know what I mean about the scouts? That's so funny. If you want to get back, you can just get it.
[375.62s -> 379.46s]  So as Clippy, you open your menu and right in the middle area is respawn.
[379.46s -> 381.94s]  You just click that and you'll go back to the start of the map. All right, cool.
[388.18s -> 389.70s]  Oh, I see you.
[403.14s -> 411.27s]  Are you all right? I'm so sorry. I should have warned you.
[411.35s -> 422.04s]  No, this is cool. Okay. Well, this is everyone. These are my weird VR friends.
[422.04s -> 428.28s]  Okay. I met most of them in here. These are my weird VR friends. Yeah.
[431.00s -> 438.60s]  Yeah. Do you want to go explore? Yeah. We'll have a look and see what this world has to offer.
[442.04s -> 451.80s]  Monkey suck. That's terrifying. So this is, this is where Frank, that's Frank. Does he talk?
[451.80s -> 455.08s]  You can go see him if you want. Yeah, you can talk to him. Even if you kind of look down and click,
[455.08s -> 459.40s]  you should be able to click on him. Really? Down the hole. Yeah. Partly down the hole and making
[459.40s -> 469.53s]  noise. You should see an orb to click on. That's really cool. Where it is. Will he pick you up
[469.53s -> 477.90s]  and bring you down? No, they don't have that. Sadly. Oh, this is bizarre. The crow up there
[477.90s -> 490.86s]  above you. The raven or whatever. He fed his upgraded weapon. Oh, God damn it. Oh my God.
[491.50s -> 498.46s]  I haven't seen that in VR yet. Oh, this is like one of the earlier ones.
[498.46s -> 503.50s]  Ace, this is the cheddar cheese I was talking about. Oh, there he goes. We lost the melted
[503.50s -> 513.58s]  plastic Mikey. Mikey? Mikey. My avatar. I'm like, I'm like a dick. We haven't even been in here.
[515.74s -> 518.14s]  So he wasn't able to clone earlier. We need to see.
[520.86s -> 525.82s]  Just like the clay mannequin. Well, at least you got working legs. You know,
[525.82s -> 529.42s]  you got that going for you. I really just like the robot.
[532.42s -> 534.50s]  So this is be our child. That's interesting.
[540.73s -> 544.25s]  We're trying to get the scout one if you'd like. I don't know if you'd prefer the scout or something
[544.25s -> 553.45s]  else. I'm so sorry. This doesn't happen. I swear.
[555.85s -> 564.87s]  This is the man that's in charge of the avatars. Yeah, there we go. So now try opening your menu,
[564.87s -> 569.19s]  click on like the little like a cylinder around him and then on the upper right.
[574.79s -> 583.35s]  So I'm cloning. There you go. According to him, you are still down there and still talking down
[583.35s -> 588.31s]  there. Wait, I'm still talking over there? Yeah. Josh was right. No, no, not you. Not you. No,
[588.31s -> 593.19s]  they're talking about, they're talking about the bug in the game that someone's pulling the
[593.19s -> 598.39s]  horn just down there talking and for him. I think there might be a mirror if you want to check
[598.39s -> 606.71s]  yourself out. Where's the mirror? She was talking to me, but I don't know where she is.
[611.86s -> 615.06s]  Where's the fire? I played this game like not even a year ago and I don't even know where the
[615.06s -> 628.42s]  fire is. Okay. So wait, I can turn this on.
[631.32s -> 638.44s]  I'm here on this map actually. What is that thing? Yeah, we could find another map if you just want
[638.44s -> 644.36s]  to like. That's what you call sanic. Saying what is that thing in dr chat is kind of redundant,
[644.36s -> 648.60s]  right? Because like what are all of these? We all look at each other like. What is that thing?
[648.60s -> 653.32s]  Talking about me? Oh no, talking about you I think. I just thought about that. That's awesome. The
[653.32s -> 662.76s]  other tracer. I can't force push. No, he was that tracer. The denim tracer. I think. Yeah.
[663.88s -> 671.64s]  Can we all be the same? Dark souls. It doesn't have the whole map. I wish it did, but I think.
[675.56s -> 677.54s]  I don't think it's been done before.
[678.10s -> 702.58s]  Um we found the mirror if you want to have a. Wait, I just have an out of body experience.
[703.22s -> 707.32s]  And kept going. Hey. Yeah. Hey. He killed me in cold blood.
[710.31s -> 716.28s]  Hey. Do you expect any less like. Oh, I think he just learned that he can. Yeah.
[718.76s -> 721.56s]  When you bring up the menu.
[727.32s -> 730.52s]  All right. I'm going to go find the mirror. Yeah, let's go find the mirror.
[730.84s -> 734.92s]  Yeah, this is it. Can we arm wrestle? We need an arm wrestling tournament.
[750.02s -> 753.54s]  Are you showing him the mirror? I told you not to do that. Sucks, wrong way.
[754.34s -> 762.26s]  Who's the big square guy? I don't know. Are we following the big square person?
[763.22s -> 770.42s]  Yeah, just follow kingpin. Oh, oh, kingpin. Okay, I get it. I get it. Yeah.
[775.72s -> 779.58s]  House in wonderland. What? What?
[784.94s -> 785.50s]  That works.
[790.97s -> 792.65s]  Didn't know if you were going to make it that there.
[793.45s -> 795.05s]  I almost didn't make it.
[797.37s -> 805.05s]  Because playmace. Down there? Are you going to catch me? Maybe.
[806.79s -> 807.35s]  We got this.
[810.90s -> 812.98s]  All right, give us a giant beam back here.
[813.86s -> 816.34s]  And then you click on that and you got a mirror over here on your right.
[817.06s -> 821.74s]  And the mirror is right here. Yeah, you should have a mirror right here if you click on it.
[821.74s -> 824.95s]  Are we? Which one of us is the real one?
[830.46s -> 834.14s]  Probably like the mouth movements on that. I'm pretty sure they're pretty good.
[837.13s -> 840.01s]  What a weird fucking world we live in right now. You understand?
[840.89s -> 846.17s]  Think about how fucked up this actually is. Think about everything they wrote books about.
[847.61s -> 850.89s]  Like 40 years ago, they wrote books about this shit and it was supposed to scare us.
[851.85s -> 854.65s]  Are you scared? You should be.
[859.86s -> 864.70s]  No, it's gonna be me.
[872.49s -> 875.53s]  Jesus. How the fuck did you do that?
[875.53s -> 879.53s]  I haven't seen them backflip before.
[881.21s -> 883.53s]  You have not seen my backflip?
[883.53s -> 885.53s]  No, I haven't seen the song. I haven't seen it backflip.
[885.53s -> 887.53s]  I haven't seen it backflip.
[887.53s -> 889.53s]  Then again.
[889.53s -> 898.01s]  Are you scared yet?
[898.01s -> 900.01s]  A little bit of girth on that flip.
[900.01s -> 904.68s]  Jesus. Can you make it down here?
[904.68s -> 908.84s]  This is awesome. I feel like I need to be more animated. I'm just like.
[914.92s -> 917.72s]  It's because the arms don't move when you walk.
[917.72s -> 920.12s]  That's a hell of a thing to drop down on people, Ace.
[921.64s -> 924.52s]  Wait. Oh, Ace. No, not that one.
[924.76s -> 926.76s]  I can't.
[926.76s -> 928.76s]  I thought we were gonna wait.
[928.76s -> 930.76s]  Is there a secret passage?
[930.76s -> 932.76s]  Have we been in it for like an hour?
[937.45s -> 941.45s]  I don't know if that was.
[941.45s -> 943.69s]  I don't know if that was a giant.
[943.69s -> 946.23s]  What's over here?
[946.23s -> 948.23s]  I'm so sorry.
[948.23s -> 952.47s]  I can't explain this.
[952.47s -> 954.97s]  I don't think it needs explaining.
[955.21s -> 957.21s]  It's very self-explanatory.
[957.21s -> 959.21s]  Is it safe to go over and look?
[959.21s -> 961.21s]  Is it really? Do you see that?
[961.21s -> 963.21s]  Just peek around the rock.
[963.21s -> 965.21s]  You can see that, right?
[965.21s -> 967.21s]  My game's like lagging.
[967.21s -> 969.21s]  Oh, death run.
[969.21s -> 971.21s]  I'd like to die.
[971.21s -> 973.21s]  There's some good death run maps.
[973.21s -> 975.21s]  Like Gmod death run.
[975.21s -> 977.21s]  Long live the king!
[977.21s -> 980.28s]  What?
[980.28s -> 982.28s]  My computer sucks.
[982.28s -> 984.28s]  Just a couple feet off the ground.
[984.52s -> 986.52s]  He's gonna roll you down the hill. Come on, man.
[986.52s -> 988.52s]  If you toggle the mirror,
[988.52s -> 990.52s]  if you toggle the mirror,
[990.52s -> 992.52s]  then it should fix.
[992.52s -> 994.52s]  Oh, okay, because it's mirroring everything.
[994.52s -> 996.52s]  Oh, he's getting framed.
[996.52s -> 998.52s]  Django, the mirror.
[998.52s -> 1000.52s]  The white box.
[1000.52s -> 1002.52s]  The box is gone.
[1002.52s -> 1004.52s]  More left.
[1004.52s -> 1006.52s]  It is lagging.
[1006.52s -> 1008.52s]  It should help a little bit.
[1008.52s -> 1010.52s]  Hey, do the back flip again.
[1010.52s -> 1012.52s]  People go to less intensive avatars
[1012.76s -> 1014.76s]  because it becomes a real problem.
[1014.76s -> 1016.76s]  Ace, get away.
[1020.76s -> 1022.76s]  You look like you're being tortured, Ace.
[1024.76s -> 1026.76s]  Okay, every character here
[1026.76s -> 1028.76s]  is from some form of media, okay?
[1028.76s -> 1030.76s]  You're from Overwatch.
[1030.76s -> 1032.76s]  You're from Overwatch.
[1032.76s -> 1034.76s]  You're from...
[1034.76s -> 1036.76s]  What? Looking out into the what?
[1036.76s -> 1038.76s]  Animated television.
[1038.76s -> 1040.76s]  You're from Sonic. You're from animated TV.
[1041.00s -> 1043.00s]  You're from... I don't know, I did a circus.
[1043.00s -> 1045.00s]  You're...
[1045.00s -> 1047.00s]  Killing four.
[1047.00s -> 1049.00s]  Movie?
[1049.00s -> 1051.00s]  Oh, his mind.
[1051.00s -> 1053.00s]  His mind.
[1053.00s -> 1055.00s]  I don't know.
[1055.00s -> 1057.00s]  He's got hundreds of them.
[1057.00s -> 1059.00s]  That was amazing.
[1059.00s -> 1061.00s]  That was incredible.
[1061.00s -> 1063.00s]  Thank you.
[1063.00s -> 1065.00s]  I just drank some tomato juice one night
[1065.00s -> 1067.00s]  and I decided to sculpt something.
[1067.00s -> 1069.00s]  This is fucking incredible.
[1069.24s -> 1071.61s]  I'm sorry.
[1071.61s -> 1073.61s]  No, you're good, Ace.
[1073.61s -> 1075.61s]  That's so good, though.
[1075.61s -> 1077.61s]  It's so good.
[1079.61s -> 1081.61s]  We learned how to...
[1081.61s -> 1083.61s]  Josh learned how to make spore models.
[1083.61s -> 1085.61s]  It's a spore model, so you can...
[1085.61s -> 1087.61s]  You can make creatures in spore
[1087.61s -> 1089.61s]  and then export the model.
[1089.61s -> 1091.61s]  Okay.
[1091.61s -> 1093.61s]  You can actually do that?
[1093.61s -> 1095.61s]  Yeah.
[1095.61s -> 1097.61s]  Anything you can make in spore, basically,
[1097.61s -> 1099.61s]  of your avatar.
[1099.61s -> 1101.61s]  The implications are terrible.
[1101.61s -> 1104.10s]  You look like what's left after eating a whole chicken.
[1104.10s -> 1106.10s]  Just the bones.
[1106.10s -> 1108.10s]  Why are you saying this to me?
[1108.10s -> 1110.10s]  This is amazing.
[1110.10s -> 1112.10s]  Anyways, I was thinking...
[1112.10s -> 1114.10s]  I was thinking Deathrun would be a fun game
[1114.10s -> 1116.10s]  if you wanted to actually have a game to play.
[1116.10s -> 1118.10s]  Yeah, let's do it.
[1118.10s -> 1120.10s]  Deathrun is good.
[1120.10s -> 1122.10s]  Do you want to set up the portal keyboard?
[1122.10s -> 1124.10s]  How did we want to do these maps?
[1124.10s -> 1126.10s]  Did you want to do invite only or
[1126.10s -> 1128.10s]  friends only?
[1128.10s -> 1130.10s]  We don't want to do a friends plus, probably, right?
[1130.10s -> 1132.10s]  Somewhere a little osteophobic.
[1132.10s -> 1134.10s]  No, not friends plus.
[1134.10s -> 1136.10s]  I'm asking if she wants to be the one
[1136.10s -> 1138.10s]  that sets up the portal.
[1138.10s -> 1140.10s]  Is he just peeing?
[1140.10s -> 1142.10s]  Do you want me to do that?
[1142.10s -> 1147.10s]  Is he okay?
[1147.10s -> 1149.34s]  I tripped and fell.
[1149.34s -> 1151.34s]  I tripped on some old bones.
[1153.34s -> 1155.34s]  I like how your belly is moving
[1155.34s -> 1157.34s]  when you talk.
[1157.34s -> 1159.34s]  I'm burying myself.
[1163.64s -> 1166.01s]  You know what you should show him, Ace?
[1166.01s -> 1168.01s]  Show him the mole rat.
[1168.01s -> 1170.01s]  That's not Ace. That's Ace.
[1170.01s -> 1172.01s]  Yeah, I know. I was pointing at the ground.
[1178.01s -> 1180.25s]  I don't have blood.
[1180.25s -> 1182.74s]  I don't know what to get.
[1182.74s -> 1184.74s]  You get used to it after a while.
[1184.74s -> 1186.74s]  This will basically be our chat.
[1186.74s -> 1188.74s]  We've been with him for a year
[1188.74s -> 1190.74s]  and he's been doing the same thing.
[1190.74s -> 1193.18s]  Wow.
[1193.18s -> 1195.18s]  You can be that big?
[1197.18s -> 1199.18s]  You can do a lot of stuff
[1199.18s -> 1201.18s]  that's just strange.
[1201.18s -> 1203.35s]  I'm not one to be talking.
[1203.35s -> 1205.35s]  Yeah, you would know.
[1205.35s -> 1207.35s]  You've seen all of your avatars.
[1207.35s -> 1209.35s]  This is amazing.
[1212.42s -> 1214.42s]  Well, I know what I'm doing for the rest of my life.
[1214.42s -> 1216.42s]  No, don't do it!
[1218.42s -> 1220.42s]  There have been people who have spent
[1220.42s -> 1222.42s]  seven days in VR before, I think, right?
[1222.42s -> 1224.42s]  There's a problem with that.
[1236.60s -> 1238.60s]  The best part was when Snake just zoomed
[1238.60s -> 1242.18s]  up these stairs.
[1242.18s -> 1246.34s]  Well, this is Dark Souls.
[1246.34s -> 1248.78s]  You are in the right place.
[1248.78s -> 1251.40s]  Oh, fuck.
[1251.40s -> 1254.73s]  Are you really loud?
[1254.73s -> 1256.73s]  I didn't know if it was like scale
[1256.73s -> 1264.65s]  meant volume too.
[1267.59s -> 1273.74s]  Alright, now do a backflip.
[1279.11s -> 1281.11s]  Come on, here he goes.
[1281.11s -> 1284.57s]  Why is there a
[1284.57s -> 1288.73s]  backflip animation?
[1288.73s -> 1290.73s]  Why not?
[1290.73s -> 1292.73s]  Fucking Christ, sorry.
[1292.73s -> 1294.97s]  There's a spooky boy.
[1294.97s -> 1296.97s]  There's a spooky boy.
[1296.97s -> 1298.97s]  I thought you were holding your ribs like
[1298.97s -> 1300.97s]  a page.
[1300.97s -> 1303.66s]  Alright, can I like get on top of him?
[1303.66s -> 1306.22s]  Oops, a daisy.
[1306.22s -> 1308.22s]  You know what?
[1308.22s -> 1310.22s]  There are some avatars that you can ride
[1310.22s -> 1312.22s]  on.
[1312.22s -> 1314.22s]  You can put seats on
[1314.22s -> 1316.39s]  avatars that you make.
[1316.39s -> 1318.39s]  Permission to use one of AceJ's avatars
[1318.39s -> 1320.70s]  to demonstrate? Which one? Is it the hot dog?
[1320.70s -> 1322.70s]  I'm getting some information.
[1322.70s -> 1324.94s]  It could be.
[1324.94s -> 1326.94s]  We'll let AceJ
[1326.94s -> 1328.94s]  pull out the
[1328.94s -> 1330.94s]  hot dog.
[1334.94s -> 1336.94s]  Why does that tracer have an Iron Man thing
[1336.94s -> 1338.94s]  and your tracer doesn't have an Iron Man thing?
[1338.94s -> 1340.94s]  Because I want to
[1340.94s -> 1342.94s]  double denim.
[1342.94s -> 1344.94s]  Double denim?
[1349.18s -> 1351.18s]  We had like an 80s, 90s
[1351.18s -> 1353.18s]  night in VR.
[1353.18s -> 1355.18s]  Oh, that's actually awesome.
[1355.18s -> 1358.18s]  I
[1358.18s -> 1360.18s]  want to double denim.
[1360.18s -> 1362.18s]  Can I get double denim on the scout?
[1362.18s -> 1364.18s]  Yes.
[1364.18s -> 1366.18s]  We could probably have someone make that.
[1366.18s -> 1368.74s]  Nice.
[1368.74s -> 1370.74s]  Give me like 10 minutes.
[1370.74s -> 1372.74s]  Who said give me 10 minutes?
[1372.74s -> 1374.74s]  Me.
[1374.74s -> 1376.74s]  IQ right here.
[1376.74s -> 1378.74s]  The talent is unbelievable.
[1378.74s -> 1380.98s]  That would take me like 5 days.
[1380.98s -> 1382.98s]  First of all,
[1382.98s -> 1384.98s]  that would take me like 3 months to read how to do it
[1384.98s -> 1386.98s]  and then it would take me like 3 weeks to actually do it.
[1386.98s -> 1388.98s]  Just give me a minute.
[1388.98s -> 1390.98s]  I'm gonna be fine.
[1390.98s -> 1392.98s]  Watch out, watch out.
[1392.98s -> 1394.98s]  I don't want to scare you or anything.
[1394.98s -> 1396.98s]  Don't turn around.
[1396.98s -> 1398.98s]  Do not turn around.
[1398.98s -> 1400.98s]  Is he gone?
[1400.98s -> 1403.42s]  Nope.
[1405.42s -> 1407.42s]  Get him away from me.
[1407.42s -> 1409.42s]  Just give him a hand.
[1409.42s -> 1411.42s]  I'll definitely don't turn around now.
[1411.42s -> 1413.42s]  Get him away from me.
[1413.42s -> 1415.42s]  Get him away from me.
[1415.42s -> 1417.42s]  I'm gonna cry.
[1417.42s -> 1419.42s]  If I see him I'm gonna cry.
[1419.42s -> 1421.42s]  Do you smile?
[1426.10s -> 1428.10s]  Open your mouth.
[1428.10s -> 1430.10s]  Open your mouth.
[1430.10s -> 1432.10s]  Open your mouth, I'm going in.
[1432.10s -> 1434.10s]  Open your mouth, I'm going in.
[1434.10s -> 1436.10s]  I don't want to go in his mouth.
[1436.10s -> 1438.10s]  Kill him.
[1438.10s -> 1440.10s]  Open your mouth.
[1440.10s -> 1442.10s]  Just like drink something.
[1442.10s -> 1446.01s]  Even it's made.
[1446.01s -> 1448.18s]  He got him.
[1448.18s -> 1451.45s]  Oh, he did it.
[1451.45s -> 1454.33s]  It's Bob, right?
[1454.33s -> 1456.33s]  Oh, he's back.
[1456.33s -> 1458.63s]  Where?
[1458.63s -> 1460.63s]  I'm not crazy.
[1460.63s -> 1462.63s]  Your music stopped playing.
[1462.63s -> 1464.63s]  You may want this good cider in case he comes back.
[1464.63s -> 1466.63s]  Oh, there you go.
[1466.63s -> 1468.63s]  Give me that, yeah. Thank you.
[1468.63s -> 1470.63s]  Oh, he's gone. I'm sorry.
[1470.63s -> 1472.63s]  I didn't know I had to grip it.
[1472.63s -> 1474.63s]  When he comes back I'm jamming this in his eye.
[1474.63s -> 1476.63s]  Is somebody playing seal right now?
[1476.63s -> 1478.63s]  Oh, behind you.
[1478.63s -> 1481.18s]  Look down, look down.
[1481.18s -> 1483.18s]  Who's playing seal?
[1483.18s -> 1485.18s]  I'm here.
[1485.18s -> 1487.18s]  Look down.
[1489.18s -> 1491.18s]  That's a classic from Batman Forever.
[1491.18s -> 1493.18s]  I'm on promise of good music.
[1493.18s -> 1495.18s]  I'm on promise of good music.
[1495.18s -> 1499.40s]  I'm on promise of good music.
[1499.40s -> 1502.60s]  I'm on promise of good music.
[1502.60s -> 1504.60s]  I'm on promise of good music.
[1504.60s -> 1507.29s]  Batman Forever is a good movie.
[1507.29s -> 1509.29s]  Everyone says it's sad.
[1509.29s -> 1511.29s]  Batman and Robin.
[1511.29s -> 1513.29s]  No, Batman and Robin and Batman and
[1513.29s -> 1515.29s]  the other one. I've forgotten forever.
[1515.29s -> 1517.29s]  Batman and the other one.
[1517.29s -> 1519.29s]  Batman and that guy with the underwear on.
[1519.29s -> 1521.29s]  Batman and friends.
[1521.29s -> 1523.29s]  And Charles. This is Charles.
[1523.29s -> 1525.29s]  Batman and Charles.
[1525.29s -> 1527.66s]  Alright.
[1527.66s -> 1529.66s]  So we want you to do some death run?
[1529.66s -> 1531.66s]  You want to do some death run?
[1531.66s -> 1533.66s]  Don't look at it, it's SCP.
[1533.66s -> 1535.90s]  Every time we go there, it's completely different.
[1535.90s -> 1537.90s]  Don't look at it, it's completely different.
[1537.90s -> 1540.71s]  Don't look at it, it's completely different.
[1540.71s -> 1542.71s]  I would say decline all friend requests and invite requests.
[1542.71s -> 1544.71s]  I would say decline all friend requests and invite requests.
[1544.71s -> 1547.59s]  That's actually kind of scary.
[1547.59s -> 1549.59s]  That's actually kind of scary.
[1549.59s -> 1572.49s]  Well, you actually die.
[1572.49s -> 1576.01s]  Oh, fuck, I did die.
[1576.01s -> 1580.42s]  Sick avatar, man.
[1580.42s -> 1582.42s]  Sick avatar, man.
[1582.42s -> 1585.05s]  Are you making a key wall?
[1585.05s -> 1587.48s]  I should make a key wall.
[1587.48s -> 1589.48s]  Even somebody that has the guy that sits at the fire.
[1589.48s -> 1591.48s]  Even somebody that has the guy that sits at the fire.
[1591.48s -> 1593.91s]  That's a fucking fantastic avatar.
[1593.91s -> 1597.88s]  AFK?
[1597.88s -> 1601.46s]  AFK!
[1601.46s -> 1604.15s]  Can I get that avatar?
[1604.15s -> 1607.86s]  Can I get that avatar?
[1607.86s -> 1609.86s]  Why are they AFK?
[1609.86s -> 1611.86s]  There's Majula.
[1611.86s -> 1613.86s]  Majula has a few Dark Souls avatars, but not many.
[1613.86s -> 1615.86s]  Majula has a few Dark Souls avatars, but not many.
[1615.86s -> 1617.86s]  I think for some reason most of the Dark Souls avatars are not like...
[1617.86s -> 1619.86s]  Leave him alone.
[1619.86s -> 1621.86s]  Leave him a being.
[1621.86s -> 1623.86s]  Leave him a being.
[1623.86s -> 1625.86s]  You can actually flap the ears, too.
[1625.86s -> 1627.86s]  You can actually flap the ears, too.
[1627.86s -> 1629.86s]  That's like the animation.
[1629.86s -> 1631.86s]  So if you...
[1631.86s -> 1633.86s]  You have a few finger animations on your touchpad.
[1633.86s -> 1635.86s]  Why is Thanos doing that?
[1635.86s -> 1637.86s]  And so basically any avatar you make,
[1637.86s -> 1639.86s]  You can remap those to any animation on the avatar.
[1639.86s -> 1641.86s]  You can remap those to any animation on the avatar.
[1641.86s -> 1643.86s]  So like the trumpet I had was mapped to one of those.
[1643.86s -> 1645.86s]  It's endgame, baby.
[1645.86s -> 1647.86s]  What is going on?
[1647.86s -> 1649.86s]  We're in the endgame.
[1649.86s -> 1651.86s]  Oh, is this what happens?
[1651.86s -> 1653.86s]  Yep.
[1653.86s -> 1655.86s]  This is what happens when you get an ant inside your pocket.
[1655.86s -> 1657.86s]  This is what happens when you get an ant inside your pocket.
[1657.86s -> 1659.86s]  He really can torch his legs a bit, you know?
[1659.86s -> 1661.86s]  He's trying to get Ant-Man out of it.
[1661.86s -> 1663.86s]  He's trying to get Ant-Man out of it.
[1663.86s -> 1666.62s]  Oh, great Thanos.
[1666.62s -> 1668.62s]  Oh, great Thanos.
[1668.62s -> 1670.62s]  This is just Taffy pull Thanos.
[1670.62s -> 1673.75s]  This is just Taffy pull Thanos.
[1673.75s -> 1675.75s]  I feel like he's going to be delicious,
[1675.75s -> 1677.75s]  and he's going to be wrapped up in individual wrappers in a candy store.
[1677.75s -> 1680.50s]  I'm made of Taffy.
[1680.50s -> 1682.50s]  I'm made of Taffy.
[1682.50s -> 1684.50s]  Mmm.
[1684.50s -> 1686.50s]  You like that like mrrmm?
[1686.50s -> 1688.50s]  You like that like mrrmm?
[1688.50s -> 1690.50s]  Dude, oddly satisfying me, you can stare at that thing for hours.
[1690.50s -> 1692.50s]  Dude, oddly satisfying me, you can stare at that thing for hours.
[1692.50s -> 1694.50s]  I opened up that video.
[1694.50s -> 1696.50s]  Who am I talking to?
[1696.50s -> 1698.50s]  I'm just like in my own world.
[1698.50s -> 1700.50s]  I'm just like in my own world.
[1700.50s -> 1702.50s]  There are people in chat,
[1702.50s -> 1704.50s]  there are a bunch of them here,
[1704.50s -> 1706.50s]  and I was just talking to myself.
[1708.50s -> 1710.50s]  God damn it.
[1710.50s -> 1712.86s]  We don't interact with anybody, but ourselves
[1717.82s -> 1720.48s]  Action by socially interacting with ourselves
[1725.62s -> 1729.61s]  I would just be I would just mute the microphone to stand in it like corner to start talking to myself
[1737.03s -> 1739.03s]  We are souls
[1741.35s -> 1743.35s]  I'm just
[1751.97s -> 1753.97s]  Just do stuff
[1754.65s -> 1759.10s]  This is so unsettling to be that it's hard to look. I don't know what it is. Okay
[1760.22s -> 1763.10s]  all these crazy scary characters and that you were like a
[1764.62s -> 1769.20s]  Burnt like monster and I cannot look at break beaker. That's the that's where I draw the line. I
[1769.20s -> 1771.20s]  Can't
[1771.28s -> 1775.68s]  Please look at me, please. You look like the people that are in my dreams
[1775.68s -> 1778.94s]  Like when you look at a person in a dream, they look like this. Thank you
[1780.52s -> 1786.56s]  No one else gets me when I make these things no one gets me this is what a person's face looks like when I dream
[1793.37s -> 1796.48s]  I'm sorry. That's a mate of oh, I
[1797.32s -> 1801.69s]  That's that's incredible. Yeah, he says that an amazing imagination
[1805.93s -> 1807.93s]  The works
[1807.93s -> 1809.93s]  I
[1829.42s -> 1831.42s]  Made some other
[1833.94s -> 1835.94s]  What are you sure
[1839.58s -> 1841.58s]  What
[1842.18s -> 1844.58s]  Oh my god
[1864.82s -> 1869.82s]  Superhero spandex, okay. They're not just any other spandex. These are made to go in fires
[1870.62s -> 1875.14s]  They're made to explode. Let me tell you you'll never have a wet dream
[1886.14s -> 1892.46s]  I'm in urine. I'm in urine. I'm in urine, you know, it's sometimes at night. You may have had a little too much milk
[1901.34s -> 1903.90s]  I'm clapping
[1931.46s -> 1933.46s]  I'm
[1958.78s -> 1960.78s]  But it would work better
[1964.30s -> 1966.30s]  Close to it
[1970.42s -> 1974.54s]  Yeah, we had to keep you know, we're doing stuff keeping around
[1990.82s -> 1992.82s]  I'm in my menu
[1996.75s -> 1998.75s]  I don't know
[2011.63s -> 2013.63s]  Yeah, we have to hold off
[2013.63s -> 2016.27s]  Okay
[2043.63s -> 2045.63s]  So
[2050.83s -> 2053.15s]  On your right hand it's the lower left
[2056.99s -> 2062.64s]  Yeah, just kind of hold your tongue there swipe down and then like near the bottom yeah bottom sorry straight down
[2070.40s -> 2072.40s]  Yeah, so so for example
[2074.00s -> 2076.64s]  Click it
[2104.00s -> 2106.08s]  For the first time
[2141.41s -> 2144.48s]  Oh
[2146.40s -> 2151.84s]  I'm sorry. I don't have any special awareness. I have special awareness issues. I can't like
[2171.96s -> 2176.84s]  Someone goes through the timer resets. I'll just give it a second. I mean you can go through whenever
[2183.32s -> 2184.68s]  My goodness
[2184.68s -> 2195.22s]  This is serious. Okay. Well, we got a second here. Let's go tell you you're over here. This is like I
[2195.78s -> 2202.56s]  Can't I can't believe that the glue man. I don't have time to react to say awesome. That was like hell. Yeah, that was fucking so cool
[2209.16s -> 2211.78s]  All right, so
[2212.14s -> 2214.14s]  Yeah, we don't need the music
[2222.51s -> 2224.51s]  Together
[2226.91s -> 2229.11s]  You guys are a little sloth, okay
[2229.11s -> 2233.31s]  So if you wanted to be able to do the rat song on cue like I said on the right hand
[2233.31s -> 2235.91s]  It's kind of like near the bottom of the touchpad to the left
[2236.59s -> 2238.59s]  So like slide your thumb down
[2242.71s -> 2244.83s]  Because you're okay, that's why I don't hear it
[2244.83s -> 2249.07s]  So if you have it playing while your thumbs held down on there hold the trigger on that hand
[2250.43s -> 2257.51s]  And then now if you release everything just hitting the trigger should play it if you just press and hold the trigger should play
[2258.27s -> 2263.23s]  Yeah, cuz it kind of saves it saves whatever you're holding to the trigger, okay?
[2264.35s -> 2268.87s]  Yeah, I mean I'm actually gonna enable your avatar so I can actually see everything you do
[2268.95s -> 2270.95s]  That's one of the other problems with the
[2271.83s -> 2275.95s]  if you're a new user the game automatically like kind of blocks everything you
[2276.55s -> 2278.55s]  You do from other users
[2280.15s -> 2283.39s]  Yeah, it's it basically keeps trolls from ruining the game
[2287.59s -> 2289.59s]  Wait no, we're still waiting for a couple
[2299.87s -> 2302.43s]  I really really want to end all of you
[2306.27s -> 2310.51s]  What I didn't do is that oh my god that was a heinous
[2310.59s -> 2312.59s]  I
[2326.31s -> 2330.91s]  Will disappear ahead of us will run up this building up the ramps and try not to die
[2330.91s -> 2334.71s]  There's someone that's trying to set traps. So just avoid the traps if you can
[2340.51s -> 2342.51s]  Oh
[2344.75s -> 2348.40s]  How do you jump
[2350.36s -> 2355.59s]  What happened did I die yeah, what killed me
[2370.66s -> 2372.66s]  What is that
[2375.42s -> 2377.42s]  Oh
[2378.14s -> 2381.72s]  Kind of like activate this trap
[2384.35s -> 2390.18s]  Yeah, we can't so somebody's gonna be crushed we can only watch he's gonna get squished
[2390.54s -> 2394.24s]  Oh my god
[2408.67s -> 2413.04s]  This is I think this is what it feels like to live inside of a YouTube poop
[2416.16s -> 2419.24s]  I'm gonna rent like a YouTube poop apartment. It would be this right?
[2420.24s -> 2422.24s]  Yeah, yeah
[2422.24s -> 2424.24s]  In a nutshell
[2451.82s -> 2453.82s]  Of course Shaggy has to win
[2455.74s -> 2457.74s]  Here to go
[2479.05s -> 2481.05s]  Invisible for me
[2486.97s -> 2489.13s]  Into the
[2519.04s -> 2521.04s]  Looks crazy
[2529.08s -> 2531.08s]  Shaggy has the original game
[2551.88s -> 2553.88s]  I
[2571.51s -> 2574.27s]  Clear the first trap so that way no one else does
[2581.99s -> 2583.99s]  I'm doing this sweet
[2587.07s -> 2589.07s]  Duck
[2596.59s -> 2599.19s]  We fell cuz we were too slow last time we gotta hurry
[2612.15s -> 2614.15s]  The corners are usually safe
[2625.88s -> 2635.32s]  How is getting Shrek the verb Oh what happened what
[2642.97s -> 2645.01s]  Got scared I got scared I had to
[2647.61s -> 2649.61s]  Oh
[2666.93s -> 2668.93s]  What are you right now
[2678.61s -> 2685.70s]  And then one of the other buttons should be the life is pain you need to brush your teeth
[2690.46s -> 2692.46s]  You left-handed or right-handed
[2709.56s -> 2711.56s]  Oh
[2744.27s -> 2746.27s]  Pickles

[4556.53s -> 4558.53s]  No, it's a light saber
[4558.53s -> 4560.84s]  It's gonna say beat saber?
[4564.84s -> 4566.84s]  Put that down there. It's real
[4566.84s -> 4568.84s]  We both have our addictions, okay?
[4568.84s -> 4570.84s]  Yeah, okay
[4570.84s -> 4572.84s]  That's not gonna damage the wood, is it?
[4572.84s -> 4574.84s]  Yeah, I don't know
[4576.84s -> 4578.84s]  That's a beverage
[4578.84s -> 4580.84s]  We use it as one of those coaster things
[4585.14s -> 4587.14s]  Yeah, like a koozie, come on
[4587.14s -> 4589.44s]  A saber koozie, duh
[4589.44s -> 4591.44s]  Whatever
[4591.44s -> 4593.44s]  What do you got back here?
[4595.44s -> 4597.44s]  Anybody touches that without permission?
[4599.75s -> 4601.75s]  Can I touch this?
[4601.75s -> 4603.75s]  Yeah, sure
[4603.75s -> 4605.75s]  What, touches this?
[4605.75s -> 4607.75s]  You can sell it too if you want
[4607.75s -> 4609.75s]  Wow
[4617.75s -> 4619.75s]  Hey, can I touch that? Can I touch that actually?
[4619.75s -> 4621.75s]  This?
[4621.75s -> 4623.75s]  Oh my god
[4623.75s -> 4625.75s]  I'm on your right now, sir
[4625.75s -> 4628.18s]  You cannot touch this
[4628.18s -> 4630.18s]  If you put your hands on this
[4630.18s -> 4632.18s]  Oh boy, you're not gonna win tomorrow
[4635.06s -> 4637.06s]  I mean, what are you gonna do now, huh?
[4637.06s -> 4639.06s]  In quite a situation
[4643.06s -> 4645.06s]  What are you gonna do?
[4647.06s -> 4649.06s]  Glass, glass
[4649.06s -> 4651.06s]  Come on, you know I have a fear of shots of glass
[4651.06s -> 4653.68s]  That's not cool
[4653.68s -> 4655.68s]  Stop playing in my house like that
[4655.68s -> 4657.68s]  I'm sorry
[4657.68s -> 4659.68s]  Who are you?
[4659.68s -> 4661.68s]  I'm not playing with you
[4661.68s -> 4663.68s]  How many times do I have to tell you guys
[4663.68s -> 4665.68s]  I'm letting you guys stay in my house
[4665.68s -> 4667.68s]  But you're just making a mug of it
[4667.68s -> 4669.68s]  I've had enough of this
[4669.68s -> 4671.68s]  We're paying rent
[4671.68s -> 4673.68s]  We're all doing a share
[4673.68s -> 4675.68s]  I'm not paying rent
[4675.68s -> 4677.68s]  What do you mean?
[4677.68s -> 4679.68s]  Thank you
[4679.68s -> 4681.68s]  I've been waiting for that for a while
[4681.68s -> 4683.68s]  At least work for me if you're gonna stay in my house
[4683.68s -> 4685.68s]  Sorry, sorry
[4685.68s -> 4687.86s]  I'll get the book
[4687.86s -> 4689.86s]  What do you drink from this?
[4689.86s -> 4692.04s]  There's no hole
[4692.04s -> 4694.53s]  Excuse me
[4694.53s -> 4696.53s]  Like that side, like that's the top
[4698.53s -> 4700.53s]  Oh wow, a bottle of spacecraft
[4713.68s -> 4715.68s]  What have you done?
[4715.68s -> 4717.68s]  This fell
[4717.68s -> 4719.68s]  Give me that back
[4719.68s -> 4722.44s]  It fell down off the table and I had to pick it up
[4722.44s -> 4724.68s]  Well, good work then
[4724.68s -> 4727.81s]  Oh dear, you have that
[4727.81s -> 4729.99s]  I don't need it anymore
[4729.99s -> 4731.99s]  I couldn't find any books
[4731.99s -> 4733.99s]  But what do you feel about art
[4733.99s -> 4735.99s]  Because there's a lot of things you can read in this image
[4735.99s -> 4737.99s]  Oh, I quite like art actually
[4737.99s -> 4739.99s]  There's a lot going on
[4748.55s -> 4751.36s]  What are you doing with my art
[4751.36s -> 4753.36s]  You just folded into a box
[4753.36s -> 4755.99s]  Here, take it, here
[4755.99s -> 4760.53s]  Thank you
[4760.53s -> 4762.53s]  How did it work?
[4762.53s -> 4764.53s]  You're very sticky
[4764.53s -> 4766.53s]  Just drop it, go way up here and drop it
[4766.53s -> 4768.96s]  So I can grab it
[4768.96s -> 4770.96s]  Put your arms up
[4770.96s -> 4772.96s]  Put your hands in the air, put your arms up
[4772.96s -> 4774.96s]  Oh no, look out
[4774.96s -> 4776.96s]  It's not even real, it's a fake thing
[4776.96s -> 4778.96s]  Don't listen
[4778.96s -> 4781.46s]  Put your hands up
[4781.46s -> 4783.46s]  You're gonna shoot us
[4783.46s -> 4785.46s]  I'm scared
[4785.46s -> 4787.46s]  Keep your hands in the air
[4787.46s -> 4790.40s]  Just keep pretending
[4790.40s -> 4792.40s]  Oh my god, I'm so scared
[4792.40s -> 4794.40s]  You want a picture of my children
[4794.40s -> 4796.84s]  Put your hands in the air
[4796.84s -> 4798.84s]  I'm robbing you
[4807.04s -> 4809.04s]  I can't
[4809.04s -> 4811.04s]  I'm gonna get that close
[4811.04s -> 4813.04s]  I was gonna tell him to keep
[4813.04s -> 4815.04s]  Hey
[4815.04s -> 4819.83s]  What's up
[4819.83s -> 4822.32s]  What's going on
[4822.32s -> 4824.32s]  I have to talk really loud because I'm in this avatar
[4824.32s -> 4827.20s]  Yeah, I see that
[4827.20s -> 4829.89s]  Nice
[4829.89s -> 4831.89s]  I found that
[4831.89s -> 4833.89s]  Got it
[4833.89s -> 4836.90s]  Wait
[4836.90s -> 4838.90s]  Would it be still the same thing you're doing
[4838.90s -> 4840.90s]  Awesome
[4840.90s -> 4842.90s]  What's that
[4842.90s -> 4845.20s]  You drop gun
[4845.20s -> 4847.20s]  Right this moment
[4847.20s -> 4849.20s]  Or I'll slit your legs off
[4849.20s -> 4856.93s]  We're talking about this
[4859.80s -> 4862.23s]  I heard aliens
[4862.23s -> 4864.23s]  I can't have a water
[4864.23s -> 4866.23s]  What's upstairs, right?
[4866.23s -> 4868.23s]  Signs
[4868.23s -> 4870.79s]  Button
[4870.79s -> 4873.22s]  Come on
[4873.22s -> 4876.93s]  Why is it here
[4876.93s -> 4878.93s]  What is that, why do I hear heavy breathing in my house
[4883.68s -> 4885.68s]  Can you bring me my other
[4885.68s -> 4887.68s]  Figurines, I wish to build bigger
[4887.68s -> 4889.68s]  Where's the button
[4889.68s -> 4891.68s]  I'm talking to you
[4891.68s -> 4893.99s]  Upstairs
[4893.99s -> 4898.28s]  I'm a quest
[4898.28s -> 4900.28s]  If you find me
[4900.28s -> 4902.28s]  What I want, I will give you a prize
[4904.64s -> 4906.64s]  I'm doing a toddler
[4906.64s -> 4911.12s]  I'm just
[4911.12s -> 4914.13s]  Just a little old man
[4914.13s -> 4921.62s]  Take the ship
[4921.62s -> 4924.56s]  And show it
[4924.56s -> 4927.76s]  That's what I live in
[4927.76s -> 4929.76s]  Have you seen any figurines
[4929.76s -> 4933.40s]  Nope
[4933.40s -> 4935.64s]  That sounded like a lie
[4935.64s -> 4937.64s]  Actually no, I don't know
[4937.64s -> 4939.94s]  Okay
[4942.82s -> 4944.82s]  Hey
[4946.82s -> 4949.00s]  Okay
[4949.00s -> 4951.75s]  Do you mind
[4951.75s -> 4955.52s]  What's wrong, what are you doing
[4955.52s -> 4957.52s]  Oh you're
[4957.52s -> 4959.52s]  I knew I liked you
[4959.52s -> 4961.52s]  You're doing the only person in the bathtub thing
[4961.52s -> 4963.52s]  I thought you were cool
[4963.52s -> 4965.83s]  Alright close it
[4965.83s -> 4967.83s]  Just a monkey
[4967.83s -> 4969.83s]  He's got a fucking knife
[4969.83s -> 4972.52s]  Why's he got a knife
[4972.52s -> 4974.52s]  I don't question it really
[4974.52s -> 4976.52s]  Why are you letting your son hold knives again
[4976.52s -> 4978.52s]  Remember what happened last time
[4978.52s -> 4980.52s]  Can you say something
[4980.52s -> 4982.69s]  I'm cooking
[4987.88s -> 4989.88s]  Gamer what
[4989.88s -> 4992.95s]  What
[4996.15s -> 4998.15s]  Hey
[4998.15s -> 5000.15s]  Have a little respect though
[5000.15s -> 5002.39s]  Come on
[5002.39s -> 5005.52s]  Get out of here
[5005.52s -> 5007.52s]  Oh oh oh right right
[5007.52s -> 5009.52s]  Oh shit
[5009.52s -> 5012.28s]  Sorry
[5012.28s -> 5014.28s]  I'm not from here
[5014.28s -> 5016.84s]  Yeah clearly
[5016.84s -> 5020.42s]  Get it, is your glue
[5020.42s -> 5022.42s]  Clearer
[5022.42s -> 5024.42s]  He's smiling
[5024.42s -> 5026.42s]  Let's give it a round of applause
[5026.42s -> 5028.42s]  Round of applause everybody
[5028.42s -> 5030.42s]  Thank you
[5030.42s -> 5033.30s]  Great job
[5033.30s -> 5035.30s]  Help
[5035.30s -> 5037.30s]  I need help up the stairs
[5037.30s -> 5039.30s]  I'm against this guy
[5039.30s -> 5041.60s]  Hey whoops I hate this
[5041.60s -> 5045.89s]  Huh
[5045.89s -> 5047.89s]  I made it up the stairs
[5047.89s -> 5049.89s]  You know how fearful
[5049.89s -> 5051.89s]  For my life I was
[5051.89s -> 5053.89s]  Hey you, hey yeah
[5053.89s -> 5055.89s]  I'm okay
[5055.89s -> 5057.89s]  He literally repaired the ramp
[5057.89s -> 5059.89s]  Everything's fine, this is fine
[5059.89s -> 5062.20s]  He repaired the ramp by saying
[5062.20s -> 5065.08s]  I just need to go up
[5065.08s -> 5067.08s]  The stairs if you were there
[5067.08s -> 5069.08s]  And he was there
[5069.08s -> 5071.08s]  And glue man did glue the ramp
[5071.08s -> 5073.08s]  And I broke down
[5073.08s -> 5076.15s]  And then he did not
[5076.15s -> 5078.32s]  Do those things
[5078.32s -> 5080.32s]  So you're saying
[5080.32s -> 5082.32s]  You did do the knot
[5082.32s -> 5084.32s]  Is what you're saying, because I said
[5084.32s -> 5086.32s]  You didn't repair the ramp
[5086.32s -> 5088.32s]  And you just said I did those things
[5088.32s -> 5090.32s]  So you're admitting that you did not do the things that you did
[5090.32s -> 5092.32s]  Right
[5092.32s -> 5094.32s]  Yeah
[5094.32s -> 5096.32s]  Oh that makes total sense
[5102.32s -> 5104.32s]  Oh wait which ones have I got on this one
[5104.32s -> 5106.69s]  You got Elmer's
[5106.69s -> 5108.69s]  Oh yeah
[5108.69s -> 5111.12s]  So what
[5111.12s -> 5113.12s]  What affiliation are you, are you Elmer's
[5113.12s -> 5115.12s]  Or Gorilla
[5115.12s -> 5117.12s]  Are you your own independent brand
[5117.12s -> 5119.12s]  You kind of working up at the place, indie company
[5119.12s -> 5121.12s]  It's like different
[5121.12s -> 5123.12s]  So Elmer's have a pretty good team
[5123.12s -> 5125.30s]  We've got Pritt Stick
[5125.30s -> 5127.30s]  In the UK we represent
[5127.30s -> 5129.73s]  The Pritt Stick
[5129.73s -> 5132.16s]  Oh that sounds kind of sick
[5132.16s -> 5134.16s]  What
[5134.16s -> 5136.16s]  Oh Pritt Stick
[5136.16s -> 5138.16s]  They use them in schools
[5138.16s -> 5140.16s]  Pritt, what you said, Pritt
[5140.16s -> 5142.16s]  Pritt, T-R-I-T-T
[5142.16s -> 5144.16s]  Pritt
[5144.16s -> 5146.16s]  And now it's that time of the day
[5146.16s -> 5148.16s]  When the life of the party
[5148.16s -> 5150.34s]  Is so crazy, you know what I mean
[5150.34s -> 5152.34s]  Hold on
[5152.34s -> 5154.34s]  Yeah that one
[5154.34s -> 5156.34s]  In the water
[5156.34s -> 5158.34s]  Everybody drink
[5160.34s -> 5162.34s]  No that's a crowbar
[5164.34s -> 5166.34s]  That's not really a cool thing to do with a crowbar man
[5169.35s -> 5171.35s]  So what else you got
[5171.35s -> 5173.35s]  Party tricks
[5173.35s -> 5175.35s]  What else can you do
[5175.35s -> 5177.35s]  Okay
[5177.35s -> 5179.35s]  I'm getting a little nervous
[5179.35s -> 5181.35s]  Okay
[5181.35s -> 5183.35s]  Okay
[5183.35s -> 5185.35s]  Maybe you want to put the crowbar down while you're
[5185.35s -> 5187.35s]  Getting a little anxious
[5187.35s -> 5189.35s]  What's up
[5189.35s -> 5191.35s]  Check someone out with it
[5191.35s -> 5193.65s]  Ladies and gentlemen
[5193.65s -> 5195.65s]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
[5195.65s -> 5197.65s]  Great Glue Man's Disappearing Trick
[5197.65s -> 5199.65s]  Magic Show
[5199.65s -> 5201.65s]  I
[5201.65s -> 5203.65s]  What I have in my hands here, thank you
[5203.65s -> 5205.65s]  Thank you, what I have in my hands here is
[5205.65s -> 5207.65s]  A crowbar, can somebody confirm
[5207.65s -> 5210.15s]  This is a crowbar
[5210.15s -> 5212.15s]  It looks like a magnet
[5212.15s -> 5214.15s]  Hold up
[5214.15s -> 5216.15s]  Let me see
[5216.15s -> 5218.15s]  Alright, you ready
[5218.15s -> 5220.15s]  Try it on the metal rods and see if it sticks like a magnet
[5220.15s -> 5222.15s]  You can test it if you want
[5224.77s -> 5226.77s]  I didn't feel anything
[5226.77s -> 5228.77s]  So it's real
[5228.77s -> 5230.77s]  It's a crowbar
[5230.77s -> 5232.77s]  And as you see here
[5232.77s -> 5234.77s]  It's real
[5234.77s -> 5237.84s]  Please
[5237.84s -> 5240.34s]  Don't talk
[5240.34s -> 5242.34s]  Don't stop talking, someone's talking in there and it's distracting me
[5242.34s -> 5244.34s]  Stop talking
[5244.34s -> 5246.34s]  I'm a monkey
[5246.34s -> 5248.34s]  Jesus
[5248.34s -> 5250.34s]  They're ruining the magic show
[5250.34s -> 5252.64s]  Shh
[5252.64s -> 5254.64s]  I was just like shut the fuck up
[5254.64s -> 5256.64s]  I'm just kidding
[5256.64s -> 5258.64s]  Like shut the fuck up
[5258.64s -> 5260.64s]  Okay, so
[5260.64s -> 5262.64s]  Here's my magic crowbar
[5262.64s -> 5264.64s]  And as you see here
[5264.64s -> 5266.64s]  All I have to do is
[5266.64s -> 5268.64s]  Swing it around a few times
[5268.64s -> 5271.46s]  Do you have a question?
[5271.46s -> 5273.46s]  Yeah, you said you were doing a disappearing act
[5273.46s -> 5275.46s]  But then you said swinging crowbar
[5275.46s -> 5277.46s]  No, no
[5279.46s -> 5281.46s]  The crowbar actually is going to be the one that disappears
[5281.46s -> 5283.46s]  So
[5283.46s -> 5285.46s]  Hold our questions
[5285.46s -> 5287.46s]  Give me a hand
[5287.46s -> 5289.46s]  We can hold our stupid fucking questions
[5289.46s -> 5291.46s]  For after the show
[5291.46s -> 5293.46s]  It's not a stupid question
[5293.46s -> 5295.46s]  You're a very valued member of the audience
[5295.46s -> 5297.46s]  So
[5297.46s -> 5299.46s]  As we show you here, we're going to spin it around in two circles
[5299.46s -> 5301.46s]  Here, count with me now
[5301.46s -> 5304.15s]  One
[5304.15s -> 5306.15s]  No, this is going to be one
[5306.15s -> 5308.15s]  This is going to be one
[5308.15s -> 5310.15s]  You all have to say it
[5310.15s -> 5312.39s]  But you can talk when I swing it
[5312.39s -> 5314.39s]  Okay
[5314.39s -> 5316.39s]  One
[5316.39s -> 5318.39s]  Two
[5318.39s -> 5320.39s]  Three
[5320.39s -> 5322.39s]  I'll fucking drink bro
[5326.60s -> 5328.60s]  It's gone
[5328.60s -> 5331.03s]  It's gone
[5331.03s -> 5336.92s]  It's gone
[5336.92s -> 5338.92s]  I searched them up on
[5338.92s -> 5340.92s]  Fiverr
[5340.92s -> 5342.92s]  Fiverr.com
[5342.92s -> 5344.92s]  They had a couple of Yelp reviews
[5344.92s -> 5346.92s]  Which is kind of weird
[5346.92s -> 5348.92s]  The site had other reviews on other sites
[5348.92s -> 5350.92s]  But I checked Yelp out and you got at least
[5350.92s -> 5353.35s]  Two and a half stars
[5353.35s -> 5355.35s]  They said the other two and a half stars disappeared
[5355.35s -> 5357.35s]  So actually
[5357.35s -> 5359.35s]  Five stars
[5359.35s -> 5361.35s]  But he made the two and a half disappear
[5361.35s -> 5363.35s]  I was like wow, he must be pretty good
[5363.35s -> 5365.35s]  I do family parties
[5365.35s -> 5367.59s]  I do family parties
[5367.59s -> 5369.59s]  As long as there's no children
[5369.59s -> 5371.59s]  Because I do have a tendency to get upset and swear at things
[5371.59s -> 5373.59s]  No children
[5373.59s -> 5375.59s]  No elderly either
[5375.59s -> 5377.59s]  I don't like the way they smell
[5377.59s -> 5379.96s]  Right
[5379.96s -> 5381.96s]  Who said that?
[5381.96s -> 5383.96s]  Right here
[5383.96s -> 5386.39s]  Right here
[5386.39s -> 5388.39s]  Okay
[5388.39s -> 5390.39s]  There it is
[5390.39s -> 5392.39s]  It's fake
[5392.39s -> 5394.95s]  What about children?
[5394.95s -> 5396.95s]  It's made of plastic
[5396.95s -> 5399.76s]  I touched it
[5399.76s -> 5401.76s]  I want to see a show now
[5401.76s -> 5403.76s]  I mean
[5403.76s -> 5405.76s]  You hired me to come here and do a show
[5405.76s -> 5407.76s]  But I want to see somebody do some shows
[5407.76s -> 5409.76s]  Okay, I'll show you something awesome
[5409.76s -> 5411.76s]  Do you want to see something awesome?
[5411.76s -> 5414.20s]  I'll show you
[5414.20s -> 5417.40s]  You
[5417.40s -> 5419.40s]  Stuck to the
[5419.40s -> 5421.40s]  I need to spray
[5421.40s -> 5423.64s]  Something
[5423.64s -> 5425.64s]  Let's see if that works
[5425.64s -> 5427.64s]  A little bit
[5427.64s -> 5429.64s]  Thank you so much
[5429.64s -> 5432.07s]  What did you get?
[5432.07s -> 5434.56s]  What did you get?
[5434.56s -> 5436.56s]  Out of me
[5436.56s -> 5438.56s]  I'm an ink demon
[5438.56s -> 5440.56s]  I thought that was milk
[5440.56s -> 5442.56s]  I was like wait a minute
[5442.56s -> 5444.56s]  I just ripped out a cord
[5447.57s -> 5449.57s]  Time out
[5449.57s -> 5451.57s]  Time out
[5451.57s -> 5458.80s]  Excuse me
[5458.80s -> 5460.80s]  What are you doing in there?
[5460.80s -> 5462.80s]  He ripped out a cord
[5462.80s -> 5464.80s]  He ripped out a cord
[5464.80s -> 5466.80s]  He'll be there in a second
[5466.80s -> 5468.80s]  It's a weird looking banana
[5468.80s -> 5472.77s]  I thought you meant pineapple
[5472.77s -> 5474.77s]  I need a banana
[5474.77s -> 5476.77s]  Or is it a coconut?
[5476.77s -> 5478.77s]  Here we go
[5478.77s -> 5480.77s]  Oh sorry, it's a pineapple
[5480.77s -> 5482.77s]  True
[5482.77s -> 5484.77s]  That's true
[5484.77s -> 5486.77s]  My arms are falling asleep
[5486.77s -> 5489.20s]  Wake him up
[5489.20s -> 5491.20s]  Where's the red saver?
[5491.20s -> 5494.98s]  Or should I have
[5494.98s -> 5496.98s]  Should I have some involvement for him
[5496.98s -> 5498.98s]  So he feels like
[5498.98s -> 5500.98s]  He seems like
[5500.98s -> 5502.98s]  He would want his kids
[5502.98s -> 5504.98s]  In elementary school to just like
[5504.98s -> 5506.98s]  Cast a presentation
[5506.98s -> 5508.98s]  Or something like ask the teacher
[5508.98s -> 5510.98s]  Can I write one letter on this word
[5510.98s -> 5512.98s]  The whole thing
[5512.98s -> 5514.98s]  Or can I do one sentence
[5514.98s -> 5516.98s]  That he was going to read the whole thing
[5516.98s -> 5518.98s]  And write it down the whole class
[5518.98s -> 5520.98s]  It's a hard job
[5520.98s -> 5522.98s]  But the old teacher feels pity
[5522.98s -> 5524.98s]  Should I write something about him?
[5524.98s -> 5526.98s]  Yeah
[5526.98s -> 5528.98s]  Then you've got the parents
[5528.98s -> 5530.98s]  You know the faculty meeting
[5530.98s -> 5532.98s]  The parent-teacher conference
[5536.98s -> 5538.98s]  I'm walking in a room
[5542.98s -> 5544.98s]  Hey how are you
[5544.98s -> 5546.98s]  You alright?
[5546.98s -> 5548.98s]  You good?
[5548.98s -> 5550.98s]  I don't think so
[5550.98s -> 5552.98s]  Alright you ready?
[5552.98s -> 5554.98s]  I'm going to show you something that's couple of
[5554.98s -> 5556.98s]  You're fine
[5556.98s -> 5559.41s]  Now see this
[5559.41s -> 5561.41s]  What would you call this huh?
[5561.41s -> 5563.41s]  This right here
[5565.78s -> 5567.78s]  The thing you do when you walk down
[5570.02s -> 5572.02s]  Step
[5572.02s -> 5574.02s]  Straight
[5574.02s -> 5576.32s]  Yes
[5576.32s -> 5578.32s]  That's what you think they are
[5578.32s -> 5580.32s]  But what they are actually
[5580.32s -> 5583.25s]  It's a challenge
[5583.25s -> 5585.25s]  You know why?
[5585.25s -> 5587.25s]  Because for someone like me a very
[5587.25s -> 5589.25s]  Handicapable individual it's very hard to go
[5589.25s -> 5591.25s]  Downstairs sometimes
[5591.25s -> 5593.25s]  So I'm going to show you
[5593.25s -> 5595.56s]  Alright I'm going to show you something
[5595.56s -> 5597.56s]  It's magical
[5597.56s -> 5599.56s]  You're not going to believe this
[5599.56s -> 5601.56s]  This is like as seen on TV but it's
[5601.56s -> 5603.56s]  As seen in person
[5603.56s -> 5605.56s]  I know you seem to be a man of
[5607.56s -> 5609.56s]  Personal connections you like that
[5609.56s -> 5611.56s]  You're a visual learner
[5611.56s -> 5613.56s]  You like to make connections you like to connect the dots
[5615.56s -> 5617.56s]  Now what I want you to do
[5617.56s -> 5619.56s]  There's two buttons
[5619.56s -> 5622.29s]  See the buttons?
[5622.29s -> 5625.68s]  No
[5625.68s -> 5627.68s]  Wink wink see the buttons
[5627.68s -> 5630.63s]  It's magic
[5630.63s -> 5632.63s]  You see the buttons
[5632.63s -> 5634.63s]  You see the buttons
[5634.63s -> 5636.63s]  They aren't there
[5636.63s -> 5639.19s]  You just got to believe
[5639.19s -> 5641.19s]  Okay okay
[5641.19s -> 5643.19s]  I see them now
[5643.19s -> 5645.19s]  I see them now
[5645.19s -> 5647.19s]  Okay just
[5647.19s -> 5649.19s]  To further solidify this
[5649.19s -> 5651.19s]  You see polar express right?
[5651.19s -> 5653.62s]  No
[5653.62s -> 5655.62s]  We're definitely screwed here
[5655.62s -> 5657.62s]  Another movie
[5657.62s -> 5659.62s]  Yeah it's all
[5659.62s -> 5661.62s]  Anyways
[5661.62s -> 5663.92s]  Now there's two buttons
[5663.92s -> 5665.92s]  One takes me
[5665.92s -> 5668.61s]  Down
[5668.61s -> 5670.61s]  One has a down arrow one has an up arrow
[5670.61s -> 5672.61s]  You want to hit the
[5672.61s -> 5676.88s]  Those aren't even buttons
[5676.88s -> 5678.88s]  The buttons are right here
[5678.88s -> 5680.88s]  Look at the buttons
[5680.88s -> 5682.88s]  Those are more like
[5682.88s -> 5684.88s]  Air cans
[5684.88s -> 5686.88s]  The buttons
[5686.88s -> 5688.88s]  The buttons now I guess
[5688.88s -> 5690.88s]  So you want to hit the left one
[5690.88s -> 5692.88s]  My left or your left?
[5692.88s -> 5694.88s]  Okay I understand
[5694.88s -> 5697.25s]  Okay wait
[5697.25s -> 5699.25s]  Okay L for left
[5699.25s -> 5702.13s]  Shoot
[5702.13s -> 5707.38s]  Left
[5707.38s -> 5710.07s]  Well this is my left
[5710.07s -> 5712.07s]  What?
[5712.07s -> 5714.24s]  Oh god
[5714.24s -> 5716.48s]  Can you move this back on?
[5716.48s -> 5718.48s]  Do you see where I'm standing?
[5718.48s -> 5720.48s]  My left
[5720.48s -> 5722.79s]  It's here
[5722.79s -> 5724.79s]  That doesn't work that's a whole other planar field
[5724.79s -> 5726.79s]  That's not going to work out is it?
[5726.79s -> 5728.79s]  My right
[5728.79s -> 5730.79s]  My left
[5730.79s -> 5733.48s]  No no okay
[5733.48s -> 5735.48s]  So face the wall
[5735.48s -> 5737.48s]  Face the wall
[5737.48s -> 5740.04s]  Now what I want you to do
[5740.04s -> 5743.17s]  Can you do this with your hands?
[5743.17s -> 5745.17s]  I got too excited I had to jump
[5745.17s -> 5747.54s]  Yeah you're doing a little power squat there
[5747.54s -> 5749.54s]  Okay
[5749.54s -> 5751.54s]  Now one of them
[5751.54s -> 5754.04s]  Is in the shape of the letter L
[5754.04s -> 5756.04s]  Do you see that? Do you see that with my hands?
[5756.04s -> 5759.62s]  Yeah that would be right
[5759.62s -> 5761.62s]  It is right that it is left
[5761.62s -> 5763.62s]  It's correct as in right
[5763.62s -> 5765.62s]  But the one that makes L
[5765.62s -> 5767.62s]  Is the left hand
[5767.62s -> 5771.78s]  But L goes like this
[5771.78s -> 5773.78s]  Yeah it does you're right
[5773.78s -> 5775.78s]  There you go
[5775.78s -> 5777.78s]  Okay
[5777.78s -> 5779.78s]  Now would you associate the left
[5779.78s -> 5781.78s]  Which one is it?
[5781.78s -> 5783.78s]  That one
[5783.78s -> 5785.78s]  It's this one
[5785.78s -> 5788.98s]  Have a drink have a cookie
[5788.98s -> 5790.98s]  Cookie you get it after the presentation
[5790.98s -> 5793.73s]  Okay thank you
[5793.73s -> 5795.73s]  Okay get ready to hit that button
[5795.73s -> 5799.36s]  Alright ready
[5799.36s -> 5801.36s]  Okay make the sound when you hit the button
[5801.36s -> 5803.36s]  Okay so I know that you hit the button
[5803.36s -> 5805.36s]  Are you going to be safe? Is everything going to be okay?
[5805.36s -> 5810.60s]  Yeah it's part of the show
[5810.60s -> 5818.66s]  Amazing
[5818.66s -> 5820.66s]  Is that crazy?
[5820.66s -> 5823.03s]  What if I hit the one on the right?
[5823.03s -> 5825.78s]  Wow
[5825.78s -> 5827.96s]  I'm going to press the button on the right now
[5827.96s -> 5835.51s]  See what you did
[5835.51s -> 5838.90s]  See what you did
[5838.90s -> 5840.90s]  Can I help you?
[5840.90s -> 5843.65s]  I can get out
[5843.65s -> 5845.65s]  By not hitting the right button
[5845.65s -> 5847.65s]  Which button makes you get back up?
[5847.65s -> 5850.34s]  No
[5850.34s -> 5852.34s]  I'm not doing it
[5852.34s -> 5858.47s]  Get up
[5858.47s -> 5860.47s]  Get up
[5860.47s -> 5862.47s]  Get up
[5862.47s -> 5864.47s]  Get up
[5864.47s -> 5866.47s]  Get him up
[5866.47s -> 5868.47s]  He's really heavy actually
[5868.47s -> 5870.47s]  He helped me pick him up
[5870.47s -> 5872.47s]  I'm grabbing you by the shoulder I'm lifting you very slowly
[5872.47s -> 5874.47s]  Give me your hands
[5874.47s -> 5876.47s]  Give me your hands
[5876.47s -> 5878.47s]  Okay
[5878.47s -> 5881.48s]  Get the phone
[5881.48s -> 5883.48s]  Please
[5883.48s -> 5885.48s]  Get the phone
[5885.48s -> 5889.12s]  Fuck

[5925.36s -> 5932.34s]  I used to be a strong man, but I guess that's over now. Thanks, man
[5932.34s -> 5934.34s]  I
[5935.04s -> 5941.12s]  Know what badness is wrong. He's trying to drown himself. He does this at least once a week, so I'm sure it's fine
[5955.34s -> 5957.34s]  Powerful stride
[5958.26s -> 5960.50s]  Oh
[5960.50s -> 5964.46s]  Right, it was like a powerful, but it was quite intimidating actually
[5964.46s -> 5966.86s]  I'm glad that you know the floor could have been rumbling and I
[5967.70s -> 5969.70s]  Paintings would have been knocked down
[5982.26s -> 5984.46s]  It's like pose halfway through okay
[5986.58s -> 5990.58s]  Get all the humans down here in this area over here
[5991.30s -> 5993.30s]  I didn't make

[6003.23s -> 6005.23s]  Did someone get gramps down here
[6011.19s -> 6013.79s]  Well, just please find a way down here, okay
[6014.79s -> 6017.41s]  Why do you keep calling us cattle man, that's a little weird
[6020.75s -> 6022.75s]  What are we I don't know
[6024.75s -> 6026.85s]  Sorry everyone Gramps is just taking a long
[6029.51s -> 6031.51s]  Yeah all the time

[14822.26s -> 14826.52s]  It's very intense the aroma here is very intense it smells like sweat
[14827.48s -> 14836.08s]  We need to know what the hell they're doing at this point. They're supposed to be fighting but they're just looking at each other really intensely

[15111.54s -> 15113.72s]  It's not a very good name

[15215.88s -> 15217.88s]  I mean it
[15217.88s -> 15222.36s]  I I I was I I mean you're peeing your pants or something or other
[15233.83s -> 15239.67s]  I was like, yeah, you know the show must go on, you know, this is true. There are no bathrooms back there. So
[15242.15s -> 15244.15s]  Yeah, I think i'm gonna be um
[15244.47s -> 15248.87s]  You know, i'm gonna be winging it. I'm probably gonna throw the match anyway, because I should
[15250.63s -> 15254.47s]  You know, it's not because i'm not uh, you know, i'm a capable fighter and everything and
[15256.15s -> 15259.19s]  Cactus jack that guy why are you gonna throw the fight?
[15261.03s -> 15263.03s]  Because I need a wave
[15264.71s -> 15267.43s]  Oh, well that makes complete sense you have to go to the bathroom so
[15268.39s -> 15274.63s]  Why not just lie down let him pin you and then go i'll go to the bathroom that sounds like a good idea
[15278.93s -> 15281.17s]  My drop
[15282.52s -> 15285.67s]  All right, you guys want to do the game show
[15288.47s -> 15290.47s]  It's the crow
[15300.87s -> 15305.03s]  Cactus jack the jobber
[15309.48s -> 15312.04s]  All right, we're ready to go to xenu's whatever it is
[15313.94s -> 15317.54s]  Game show is what it's called. If you search the game show it'll come up. Yeah
[15318.66s -> 15321.14s]  Should I do this because I only have like three people out of here?
[15322.26s -> 15324.26s]  Um, I could do it
[15324.58s -> 15326.58s]  Okay, well, or do you want to make the game show match?
[15332.90s -> 15334.90s]  Drop down on somebody
[15344.20s -> 15349.30s]  Anyone want some all right get on the table get on the table scouts
[15352.68s -> 15354.92s]  Sit on it josh, it's like the old g-mod video
[15357.16s -> 15361.96s]  Kind of worked for us. Oh jesus that table murdered another audience member josh. Hold still
[15368.12s -> 15371.80s]  There we go, you need one with a seat all right section get one of your avatars with a seat
[15372.76s -> 15383.83s]  Uh, you did like this is really fun force awakens force awakens. Oh, I can't wait
[15384.95s -> 15386.95s]  There's a portal in the ring
[15396.28s -> 15407.96s]  Okay, this is the game show i don't buy this to me on that one it was a shitty dumb reference
[15408.60s -> 15415.32s]  It's good
[15415.88s -> 15420.12s]  Oh, there's rules here's rules. I'll show you guys how this works. It's really simple back until the game is over
[15421.00s -> 15425.72s]  When there are two people left use questions with two possible answers that explains it pretty well
[15429.80s -> 15431.80s]  Control board here
[15432.04s -> 15434.04s]  so if everybody comes onto this side
[15435.46s -> 15440.26s]  You get dropped and then um the the the runner of the show stands on this side
[15440.26s -> 15444.02s]  Don't press any buttons yet, and then you can you can close the the host wall here
[15444.10s -> 15445.70s]  So once you hit that one
[15445.70s -> 15448.42s]  Nobody can walk in between the host side and the game side
[15449.38s -> 15453.62s]  And this and then this audience button closes the audience off so they can't come back into the game
[15454.58s -> 15457.22s]  interesting then basically what you do is like you say like
[15457.62s -> 15461.94s]  You say a multiple choice question with everybody standing out here and the answer is either a b or c
[15463.06s -> 15464.02s]  and then
[15464.02s -> 15467.36s]  You select the correct answer. Let's say it was a boom
[15467.84s -> 15471.36s]  Everybody except for a falls through and then they spawn back on the audience side
[15471.76s -> 15474.64s]  So you have to come up with your own questions. There's no like built-in questions
[15474.88s -> 15480.48s]  Yeah, and there's actually there's a there's a reset button after you do that that resets it and then the music button
[15481.60s -> 15485.28s]  You can kind of use that as a timer once the music ends then you can hit the button
[15493.11s -> 15495.11s]  Locks everybody in so like
[15495.83s -> 15500.95s]  When you hit cage nobody else can choose an answer so if they either chose the wrong one or they can't switch last
[15505.54s -> 15510.25s]  So you get a couple people to be hosts if you want and then yeah, it's really fun
[15519.75s -> 15523.51s]  I mean I could pull up like halo trivia or something. Yeah, I think I think like
[15523.59s -> 15528.23s]  It might be more fun to have like actual trivia questions rather than like video game trivia or something
[15528.95s -> 15532.23s]  What's my aunt's name? Is it like mary? Uh, you know
[15532.95s -> 15534.95s]  It's probably better with like actual
[15535.99s -> 15537.99s]  Get out of me ty
[15538.07s -> 15540.79s]  No, hey, I thought you didn't want to hear me say that
[15545.28s -> 15547.60s]  Halo trivia, I never even played halo
[15551.25s -> 15553.25s]  I've never even opened the game miss
[15554.28s -> 15556.28s]  What would be a fun trivia set?
[15556.92s -> 15560.68s]  Oh, I don't like diablo by diablo 2 maybe diablo 3 diablo 2
[15567.32s -> 15575.24s]  Sit down today and write some diablo 2 trivia questions. Yeah. Yeah, what's the last boss of the game fucking bail? Come on
[15578.40s -> 15584.34s]  Oh, I remember bail oh qo's here qo you want to see how to run the game, okay
[15587.60s -> 15589.60s]  The host stands on this side
[15590.16s -> 15594.40s]  And everybody else stands over there. So everybody come stand over here right now and the great I get my face
[15594.40s -> 15596.40s]  I like feel my face peeling off
[15599.16s -> 15604.28s]  Okay, what's two plus two is that a sonic character this is a character sonic right crocodile

[18260.38s -> 18263.82s]  It's a really good map, but it might take a little bit to load. It's like 200 mb
[18264.86s -> 18266.30s]  That's all right
[18266.30s -> 18269.53s]  hunter's dream
[18269.53s -> 18271.53s]  All right. We'll we'll wrap it up here
[18282.91s -> 18284.91s]  This has been wild though
[18288.19s -> 18290.19s]  I've never seen anything like this before. It's just it
[18290.83s -> 18292.83s]  It's like a hangout session

[18315.82s -> 18319.02s]  I know you can make your own models in something like second life, but these are
[18320.14s -> 18324.86s]  They're incredibly detailed. It's not it's they're like actually in-game avatars. It's ridiculous
[18325.34s -> 18328.14s]  Isn't second life a little limited with what you can actually make or is it not?
[18334.99s -> 18337.23s]  if you missed the gloom ad and the rats and
[18338.03s -> 18340.03s]  The germ of pain they were fantastic

[19187.58s -> 19190.08s]  all the help from uh

[19208.96s -> 19212.64s]  Uh, i'm blown away by how fucking interesting and fun that was so
[19215.01s -> 19218.29s]  Got to do it again. Yeah, i'm gonna take a break from vr though
[19219.33s -> 19222.93s]  My last like five streams in a row have been vr. That's like taxing on me
[19228.24s -> 19228.96s]  but
[19228.96s -> 19231.39s]  Uh, that is gonna be it
[19231.39s -> 19233.39s]  I will see you guys tomorrow
[19233.47s -> 19237.87s]  We're gonna take a break from vr
[19237.87s -> 19239.74s]  Try to get a uh
[19239.74s -> 19242.94s]  Uh a not a virtual reality stream tomorrow
[19244.35s -> 19246.75s]  I'm not exactly sure what we're gonna do. There's a couple of options. So
[19247.55s -> 19248.99s]  we will
[19248.99s -> 19250.67s]  Figure that out tomorrow
[19250.67s -> 19252.67s]  Or i'll do it. I'll figure it out tonight
[19253.31s -> 19256.06s]  Hope you had fun
[19256.06s -> 19260.54s]  It was interesting to say the least if you take it off
[19261.70s -> 19272.82s]  Uh, hopefully we see you soon. Thank you. And let's get out of here. I'm gonna i'll be right back. I'm gonna just take a
[19273.46s -> 19277.15s]  quick break
[19277.15s -> 19279.15s]  And when I come back we'll do the bits
[19279.63s -> 19281.63s]  Just gonna grab some water. That's it
[19281.63s -> 19283.63s]  I will be right back. See you in a minute
[19362.18s -> 19452.75s]  Okay
[19452.75s -> 19458.78s]  Hello
[19458.78s -> 19462.08s]  That was just so all over the place. I don't even remember what happened
[19462.72s -> 19467.07s]  I have like bits and pieces. It really was a dream, you know, you just wake up and you go
[19467.15s -> 19469.15s]  Oh, wait, wait, what the fuck is that?
[19469.31s -> 19471.47s]  Oh that happened then that happened and it starts to leave you
[19472.19s -> 19483.06s]  That was a lot of fun. Thanks for hanging out. Thanks, uh for showing me all that stuff
[19484.61s -> 19486.53s]  Vr josh, thank you so much
[19486.53s -> 19490.56s]  I got a nice controlled
[19490.80s -> 19492.80s]  Uh tour of vr chat
[19493.36s -> 19497.10s]  Kiwa was watching the dinner clip. Oh god
[19501.65s -> 19503.57s]  Yeah, we were gonna do
[19503.57s -> 19505.57s]  a mind show back and forth thing
[19506.29s -> 19508.85s]  because if you weren't here earlier
[19508.85s -> 19509.97s]  the
[19509.97s -> 19511.49s]  for some reason
[19511.49s -> 19513.81s]  we've been playing like me and kiwa have been talking about this for like
[19514.69s -> 19517.10s]  At least a few weeks, right?
[19517.10s -> 19518.77s]  and
[19518.77s -> 19523.33s]  Well, let's go. Let's do it. Oh, no. Yeah, tuesday sounds good tuesday afternoon. Yeah tuesday night. That sounds good
[19524.13s -> 19526.13s]  the day that
[19526.77s -> 19528.69s]  Vr chat was like off
[19528.69s -> 19531.73s]  There was technical server problems earlier this afternoon
[19532.45s -> 19539.33s]  So we're kind of just like oh fuck. Well, now what the hell are we gonna do? So we're gonna do a mind show thing
[19540.13s -> 19542.18s]  and then
[19542.18s -> 19545.62s]  After like 30 40 minutes hanging out trying to figure out what the hell we were gonna do
[19546.91s -> 19550.75s]  It came back. So we just figured all right. Let's just do what we were planning on doing in the first place
[19552.03s -> 19554.03s]  But you probably will see that eventually
[19556.84s -> 19562.80s]  QRS
[19562.80s -> 19564.96s]  But uh, i'll see tomorrow. Let's do the bits
[19566.54s -> 19569.82s]  Vr is always a joy. I'm glad i'm i'm very happy
[19570.46s -> 19571.90s]  that I could
[19571.90s -> 19573.98s]  Have the stamina to do it for more than five hours today
[19574.70s -> 19577.39s]  So that's good
[19577.39s -> 19582.03s]  And let's teleport ourselves back about six hours here five and a half hours or so
[19583.76s -> 19586.82s]  we had
[19586.82s -> 19589.14s]  Uh back here guild hero
[19590.46s -> 19593.10s]  Guild hero gave a ton of community subs
[19594.35s -> 19595.79s]  Looks like 20
[19595.79s -> 19596.83s]  more than that
[19596.83s -> 19600.34s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine ten
[19601.42s -> 19606.06s]  Yeah, this is the 20 community subs from guild hero. Thank you so much. That's a fucking shitload. Sorry. I missed it
[19613.73s -> 19616.21s]  PMF my pleasure. It was a lot of fun
[19619.78s -> 19622.18s]  And that scripts three gave fifty dollars
[19624.38s -> 19628.80s]  Fifty dollars five thousand bits from scripts three. Thank you
[19630.53s -> 19636.61s]  Uh, they say hey germa i've been a part of your community for a while on discord where i've been putting my writing and I was curious
[19637.41s -> 19640.05s]  If you'd be interested in being hired to do a audio book
[19641.09s -> 19643.09s]  of my short story
[19643.41s -> 19647.57s]  The skeleton knight it's a fantasy comedy short about an undead knight
[19649.62s -> 19652.36s]  Uh, here here's the thing. I would say absolutely
[19653.22s -> 19655.63s]  But here's my problem
[19655.63s -> 19659.23s]  I i'm like so hard to like get to do anything
[19661.71s -> 19665.63s]  I I really don't want to be like let's do it. Um, oh, yeah, let's go
[19666.35s -> 19668.43s]  And then I just like put it off and put it off and put it off
[19677.46s -> 19680.42s]  Do it in one stream and then that might actually be kind of funny
[19683.60s -> 19687.41s]  Uh, what's the length? How long is it? What's the uh the length on it?
[19691.78s -> 19695.38s]  Because depending on how long something like that is I just I really just don't have time
[19695.86s -> 19700.59s]  It's like 10 pages. That's not bad
[19712.88s -> 19715.68s]  Uh hit give me do if you have like a link
[19716.62s -> 19721.26s]  Hit up one of the mods and link one of the mods and then we'll we'll go from there
[19726.14s -> 19729.50s]  But I cannot like guarantee that I will because I just don't want to say yeah, man
[19729.50s -> 19730.78s]  That sounds great
[19730.78s -> 19733.82s]  And I don't want to just put it off and not do it or something. You know, I want to
[19734.38s -> 19736.62s]  Obviously take that seriously if I say yes
[19737.34s -> 19746.61s]  Will I play bloodborne? No, unfortunately not not on stream
[19750.06s -> 19755.26s]  Because I've just played through it so many times. I've done it at least four three four five times
[19756.06s -> 19760.22s]  It would just be me showing you a game that you may have already played too
[19760.96s -> 19764.64s]  And we'll just kind of be sitting there going. Hey, remember this part. I remember this part
[19765.12s -> 19767.76s]  No, I love it. Hey, you guys. Hey, watch. Hey, remember that man. Watch this part
[19769.09s -> 19771.09s]  I guess maybe that's all right
[19772.88s -> 19780.77s]  exactly
[19780.77s -> 19782.77s]  I want to see you nerd out
[19783.09s -> 19785.89s]  Maybe one day when we got really nothing to do
[19786.85s -> 19788.69s]  if there's a lull in
[19788.69s -> 19792.77s]  New games or things that I want to try to do then maybe we'll just do it
[19794.62s -> 19800.10s]  Add on the list, you know
[19800.10s -> 19802.10s]  A l u l and new one
[19803.25s -> 19805.25s]  l u l what's l u l
[19805.49s -> 19808.11s]  Wait, why why is everybody laughing?
[19810.35s -> 19812.35s]  Allah. Oh, oh, oh
[19812.67s -> 19814.67s]  Okay, I get it. I was like wait what?
[19816.51s -> 19821.15s]  Hey, thank you sad vega for the 250 while an early stream glad to see this at work
[19821.71s -> 19829.07s]  Jerma, I have a friend whose internet is 0.8 megabits up and 8 megabits down their isp promises 10 down and 3 up
[19829.07s -> 19830.83s]  What do you think they should do?
[19830.83s -> 19834.99s]  um, it really depends on the isp
[19835.39s -> 19838.98s]  but isps a lot of them suck and
[19839.62s -> 19840.82s]  have
[19840.82s -> 19846.66s]  Thousands of employees that all have to communicate with each other about what's wrong with your neighborhood's internet
[19847.68s -> 19848.88s]  so
[19848.88s -> 19850.88s]  It's I can't really give you any
[19851.28s -> 19853.84s]  Advice the only advice you can give is just make sure
[19855.15s -> 19858.27s]  That you at least get some somewhat what you're paying for
[19860.32s -> 19862.32s]  because if you're getting speeds that are like
[19862.48s -> 19869.31s]  Not even 10 of what you're paying for then you need to call tech support and tell them like hey
[19869.31s -> 19874.75s]  I'm get i'm not even getting 10 of what I pay for somebody's got to fix it because I the isps do have
[19875.86s -> 19879.06s]  you know, they have a not like guarantees, but they
[19880.56s -> 19889.41s]  If you complain enough and you talk about it enough somebody will come out there, you know
[19889.65s -> 19892.21s]  I mean, I think look at look at the internet problems that i've had
[19893.37s -> 19897.90s]  Eventually somebody fix it. Somebody will come out and it will get done. It'll get fixed
[19901.87s -> 19904.75s]  But those speeds do not sound like what you should be getting
[19908.56s -> 19913.84s]  But thank you to for real dough 25 for the 250. They say watch this. Well, let's see. What watch what?
[19914.24s -> 19920.80s]  This is the scout voice actor guy. I think I think I've actually have I see
[19921.36s -> 19924.85s]  I've not I didn't see this one
[19924.85s -> 19927.25s]  Uh, it's not gonna play through what am I gonna change my desktop?
[19927.73s -> 19940.64s]  Let's see it's playing through vr. Yeah, i'm gonna put vr in a box for like a week or two
[19945.18s -> 19947.18s]  We will open that box again
[19950.29s -> 19955.54s]  another time right this
[19959.49s -> 19963.31s]  You should be able to hear this
[19963.31s -> 19969.15s]  I'm the scout guys. And so obviously I have to save the day. I save all kinds of people. I save little kids
[19969.63s -> 19972.59s]  Save kittens. I save I have to save, you know
[19973.79s -> 19976.43s]  Coupons for buying discounts at the grocery store
[19976.43s -> 19981.31s]  But I also save presidents and when i'm gonna save a president there's only one thing I need to say
[19981.95s -> 19983.79s]  one thing baby
[19983.79s -> 19985.79s]  Mr. President get down
[19986.19s -> 19993.07s]  You know and I tackle him walking into the places and see a bullet it's coming for him. Mr. President get down
[19994.51s -> 19997.25s]  I gotta save him. He's in big trouble. He's the president
[19998.13s -> 20000.13s]  I
[20009.22s -> 20023.38s]  Am I still in vr chat I feel like i'm still there god well you can watch it that was a snippet of
[20024.18s -> 20026.18s]  nate is uh, it's nate
[20027.00s -> 20029.40s]  And that's the scout voice actor hilarious, dude
[20034.31s -> 20036.31s]  coupons for the grocery store
[20044.07s -> 20048.47s]  But thank you for real dough for the 250. Yeah, that's uh, that's nate's twitch channel as well
[20049.03s -> 20059.27s]  Don't give it a fall sticks renegade. Thanks for the 255 jerma. You should try call of Juarez gunslinger again
[20060.07s -> 20065.44s]  Didn't work for you last time, but maybe you can try again definitely the best western shooter next to red deads
[20066.08s -> 20073.36s]  The playstation 3 version if you can sense the pc version failed on your last time. Yeah, I don't know somewhere
[20073.52s -> 20079.64s]  That was weird. I think that was actually on a different computer. I did try to play
[20080.20s -> 20086.23s]  Call of Juarez and it was just a frame ready mess every time I tried to stream it. It was weird
[20088.08s -> 20090.08s]  Yeah, maybe i'll install it and just see if it opens
[20091.70s -> 20094.50s]  Please one more. I'm well, i'm willing to give it a try. It's
[20099.20s -> 20103.19s]  I'm willing to try
[20103.19s -> 20106.39s]  Because I heard it was really fun. I was really real if you were at that stream
[20106.47s -> 20114.24s]  I was really disappointed because I really wanted to play it. Hey, actually, you know, let's play fuck. Let's do it tomorrow
[20114.80s -> 20116.48s]  Should we just do that tomorrow?
[20116.48s -> 20121.75s]  Let's try to figure out what I wanted to play tomorrow. Let's do it tomorrow. Whatever
[20129.65s -> 20131.65s]  RIP dragons dogma
[20132.13s -> 20138.28s]  I better beat this one
[20138.28s -> 20141.97s]  Yeah phoenix if you know, uh phoenix right ace attorney I
[20143.44s -> 20147.22s]  I hung the uh the jacket up on this one for a little while because
[20148.02s -> 20150.58s]  It's I think it's not the game that I initially thought it was
[20151.86s -> 20153.86s]  So a lot of people have been telling me
[20153.94s -> 20157.54s]  Uh, you might not really like streaming it and i'm like wait, what do you mean?
[20157.62s -> 20160.58s]  And we've been talking about it and i'm gonna play the first
[20161.48s -> 20162.36s]  like
[20162.36s -> 20164.76s]  Hour or so just to see if it's something I think i'd want to stream
[20176.37s -> 20178.37s]  It looks like it's kind of 50 50
[20179.25s -> 20183.01s]  On whether or not I should play it or not and look it's not like oh, what do you
[20183.73s -> 20185.73s]  I'm gonna make the final decision on it, right?
[20187.01s -> 20189.89s]  But i'll just make sure that it's something that I want to do
[20193.43s -> 20198.63s]  So that's kind of the i'm gonna I gotta play that for like an hour to see if it's something I think I would have fun doing
[20199.43s -> 20205.36s]  It's a lot of talking. Yeah, it's also very long too. Isn't isn't it?
[20205.68s -> 20210.56s]  It's I thought it was just kind of like a 12 8 to 12 hour experience where you like yell in a courtroom and like argue
[20210.56s -> 20214.00s]  With people but it's like a full on like 40 to 50 hour
[20214.86s -> 20216.86s]  investigative detective game, right
[20218.05s -> 20220.45s]  So I need to be prepared for that and I need to
[20221.09s -> 20223.09s]  Know that it's something I want to do
[20228.40s -> 20230.88s]  People said you'd hate disassembly too. I think you'll be fine
[20232.36s -> 20234.36s]  Yeah, but this the thing about disassembly is
[20236.77s -> 20238.29s]  each one of those
[20238.29s -> 20240.29s]  Things to take apart in disassembly
[20240.84s -> 20242.84s]  Is like 10 to 20 minutes
[20243.16s -> 20247.48s]  So it's not like oh just do one case and see how you feel isn't the first case like 10 hours
[20248.20s -> 20257.16s]  Or something really really long
[20257.16s -> 20259.16s]  First case is 10 minutes really
[20259.72s -> 20261.72s]  That's like an hour or two. Oh, okay
[20263.52s -> 20266.24s]  We'll see though. I'm i'll give you an answer in the next
[20266.88s -> 20269.36s]  because here's another thing that a lot of people I want to make sure everyone's aware of
[20269.92s -> 20271.92s]  because i've been talking about it for
[20271.92s -> 20273.92s]  a couple weeks, but
[20274.16s -> 20276.16s]  I am going to be taking
[20277.36s -> 20280.18s]  a bunch of time off
[20280.26s -> 20283.36s]  next week
[20283.36s -> 20284.96s]  my mother
[20284.96s -> 20286.96s]  Who I haven't seen in about seven months?
[20287.60s -> 20289.97s]  Is coming up to visit
[20290.05s -> 20292.05s]  So i'm going to be spending
[20292.77s -> 20294.21s]  time with her
[20294.21s -> 20299.86s]  And I know that one of my good friends came up like three weeks four weeks ago
[20299.94s -> 20304.18s]  And I took a bunch of time off then too. It's just this people are coming up to visit
[20305.43s -> 20307.43s]  in this kind of late spring
[20309.54s -> 20312.02s]  So i'm going to be spending a lot of time with my mother so
[20313.40s -> 20315.40s]  This at this time next week
[20315.40s -> 20317.70s]  Or in a couple day a couple days before that
[20318.87s -> 20323.35s]  Somewhere around i'll give you a very clear indicator of uh when i'm going to be off but
[20324.45s -> 20331.12s]  I'm going to be taking like a at least four or five straight days off because I miss my mom
[20331.12s -> 20333.12s]  You know, i haven't seen her in a long time. So
[20333.92s -> 20335.92s]  She's got a lot of things that she wants to do
[20336.08s -> 20338.24s]  Every day she wants to go do things and see things
[20338.72s -> 20342.68s]  So i'm going to be taking a little
[20342.68s -> 20345.80s]  Like vacation, I guess
[20345.80s -> 20352.47s]  And mom vacation, but I because of that
[20353.60s -> 20356.00s]  I'm probably going to be streaming this week
[20356.95s -> 20362.55s]  Probably every day. So today's tuesday wednesday thursday
[20364.01s -> 20365.13s]  uh
[20365.13s -> 20374.78s]  I'll probably try to admit as much as I can friday. I mean i'm gonna try
[20377.21s -> 20378.57s]  because
[20378.57s -> 20383.56s]  I mean i'm gonna be taking like five straight days off that are not get drunk
[20383.56s -> 20386.60s]  I'm not gonna i'm not gonna get drunk. Don't worry. I'll give you an indicator of what's going on
[20387.08s -> 20392.38s]  this is gonna be at least three days in a row here at least and then
[20394.14s -> 20397.02s]  Saturday like sunday, I don't know. We'll have to find out
[20397.42s -> 20403.64s]  I'm not exactly sure what's gonna happen, but i'm gonna try to go as much as I can before I take it off
[20406.23s -> 20408.15s]  Just to give you some more
[20408.15s -> 20414.86s]  Awareness, you know, but thank you to atrox atrox for the 250
[20415.86s -> 20422.38s]  Bonk germa venus. Thank you
[20422.38s -> 20426.95s]  Don't push yourself. Don't feel like you need to stream every day. No, I know I know and you guys know this
[20427.67s -> 20432.71s]  As well as I do if I if i'm not gonna stream then i'll just change the sus, you know
[20432.79s -> 20434.79s]  We'll just no, I just won't do it
[20436.22s -> 20442.22s]  You guys know that i'm not gonna you know, there's no pressure here or anything. This is how this channel has always been like that
[20443.56s -> 20449.91s]  So no, it's all good. Don't worry
[20449.91s -> 20451.99s]  Sometimes the sus cast itself
[20455.26s -> 20458.38s]  Hey bake me home. Thanks for 250. Thanks for the 200 bits
[20458.94s -> 20464.33s]  It was 250. What are you talking about?
[20464.33s -> 20466.57s]  That was 250. That was two dollars and 57
[20467.13s -> 20474.81s]  Uh, thank you other guy for the four dollars germa your streams never fail to make me laugh
[20474.89s -> 20477.53s]  I'm watching you when I really should be studying but whatever
[20478.79s -> 20483.14s]  But I clicked off the wrong thing there
[20484.66s -> 20486.66s]  Uh, thank you other guy 42
[20491.56s -> 20494.84s]  and there's
[20494.84s -> 20499.30s]  A video link here
[20499.30s -> 20501.30s]  What the hell oh
[20501.38s -> 20503.08s]  What?
[20503.08s -> 20505.08s]  Why why did somebody do that?
[20507.99s -> 20508.95s]  What?
[20508.95s -> 20510.95s]  That's just like it just hurts
[20512.46s -> 20515.02s]  There's a guy jumping off of a bench just landing on his stomach
[20521.13s -> 20527.94s]  Oh my god
[20527.94s -> 20533.51s]  great video
[20533.51s -> 20538.71s]  Joe show here. Look if you really want to watch it. It's a guy just jumping off a fucking bench and getting hurt
[20539.43s -> 20551.18s]  He's just like he's in a suit. Why did you link me this video?
[20554.38s -> 20556.62s]  There's just no context. He's just like, all right, i'm gonna do this
[20560.33s -> 20562.33s]  I don't know. I don't know why he did that
[20566.39s -> 20575.80s]  agent 47
[20575.80s -> 20580.44s]  Uh smelly boy. Thanks for the 250 you could conceivably film an entire germa rumble in vr chat
[20581.51s -> 20582.39s]  Yeah
[20582.39s -> 20585.53s]  It would take a lot of choreography though
[20586.17s -> 20589.69s]  Because there's no collision
[20591.78s -> 20596.58s]  Vr chat is you just float around and is unless you have the leg trackers. There's no
[20598.46s -> 20601.74s]  There's not a whole lot of okay if I like throw a handout and punch somebody in the face
[20602.38s -> 20607.18s]  They need to know that it's coming and it's gonna be total acting the whole thing has to be blocked out
[20607.90s -> 20613.34s]  It would be fun
[20613.34s -> 20615.42s]  Nope. Yeah, there's no pile of drivers. No power bombs
[20616.06s -> 20619.35s]  You'd have a little bit of trouble even doing something from the top rope
[20621.30s -> 20626.26s]  Leg trackers exist. Yeah, you can just just buy more lighthouses and stick them on your legs, right? That's how it works. I think
[20629.26s -> 20633.34s]  Hey bro lock. Thanks for the five dollars. Here you go. Mate. Just look at yourself from our perspective. Oh god
[20647.10s -> 20649.10s]  That's you guys looking at me
[20650.38s -> 20653.26s]  looking at you
[20653.34s -> 20656.86s]  In vr
[20656.86s -> 20658.86s]  That's a full circle. It's kind of weird
[20664.01s -> 20668.81s]  But thank you bro. Look. Thank you frody and weapon for the 250 vr chat looks like a seriously fun time
[20670.39s -> 20672.39s]  Yeah, I had I had my doubts
[20673.11s -> 20679.99s]  When we were first talking about it and first loading in that was a controlled environment though, because that was all of
[20680.71s -> 20682.87s]  Uh, like kewo kewo vr josh
[20683.59s -> 20687.19s]  Like they know people in like the vr community
[20688.15s -> 20690.31s]  So that was kind of a lot of the people that they know
[20691.03s -> 20693.27s]  That wasn't just random lobbies so
[20693.99s -> 20701.64s]  It was a little bit more controlled
[20701.64s -> 20705.08s]  I could imagine yeah being in like in public would be a lot different
[20712.04s -> 20716.14s]  Public vr is hell
[20716.14s -> 20720.86s]  I figured for my first experience ever in it. I'd want to see what it has to offer before
[20721.66s -> 20726.06s]  Dunking my head in and just going into a public server with a hundred people in it
[20734.14s -> 20736.06s]  Yeah, I could imagine how it'd be
[20736.06s -> 20739.18s]  hard to navigate
[20739.18s -> 20741.18s]  Still it was still fun though. It was
[20741.74s -> 20745.51s]  Could end up doing like a viewer only server
[20746.66s -> 20748.66s]  Yeah, that would be all right. That would be fine
[20749.74s -> 20751.82s]  For the most part, you know if something happened if somebody was
[20752.46s -> 20754.70s]  Doing something bad or something just you know, kick them
[20762.18s -> 20767.51s]  Yeah, it was a fun time
[20767.51s -> 20771.99s]  And thank you soup or seal for the 250 just a reminder about the joel pogo stuck challenge
[20772.55s -> 20774.55s]  That uh that challenge is changing
[20774.71s -> 20777.11s]  Joel and I have talked
[20777.11s -> 20779.11s]  He got really busy. So we pushed it off
[20779.67s -> 20781.43s]  And we're gonna do something else
[20781.43s -> 20783.43s]  a lot more elaborate so
[20785.30s -> 20787.30s]  No more potential no more pogo stuck
[20787.62s -> 20790.34s]  Something better trust me when I say that you're gonna like it a lot better
[20790.90s -> 20795.70s]  All right, let's get the credits rolling, too. Oh, we have a minute here
[20798.17s -> 20800.74s]  Credits they are
[20800.74s -> 20802.74s]  All the subs new subs old subs all you
[20803.38s -> 20805.98s]  Thank you guys
[20805.98s -> 20809.00s]  for another fun
[20809.00s -> 20812.41s]  vr stream
[20812.41s -> 20814.89s]  Let's put it in the box for a little while play some other games
[20815.98s -> 20819.77s]  Do some other things
[20819.77s -> 20821.56s]  I'll see you tomorrow
[20821.56s -> 20827.00s]  Maybe we'll just play call of Juarez. I maybe we'll just do that. I i'm just gonna download it and see if it works
[20827.56s -> 20839.70s]  A couple more bits came in we had door cube. Thanks for 250 door cube
[20840.34s -> 20845.43s]  Are you gonna show your mom vr? I don't think she could handle it. I really don't think so
[20847.99s -> 20850.50s]  That would be
[20850.50s -> 20856.65s]  Uh, no, she probably wouldn't want to go in it. She might want to watch me do it
[20857.21s -> 20859.21s]  But not actually do it herself
[20860.49s -> 20863.56s]  But you know it is what it is
[20863.64s -> 20865.64s]  Uh, thank you nickname
[20865.80s -> 20870.44s]  Nickname jack for the 250 skimming through this stream and seeing the highlights makes me sad. I missed the stream
[20871.16s -> 20873.16s]  But god damn it was so funny
[20874.23s -> 20876.52s]  Thank you all i'm
[20876.52s -> 20878.73s]  I kind of was just
[20878.73s -> 20881.61s]  I was kind of just involving myself a little you know
[20882.33s -> 20887.67s]  Some of these guys are like vr veterans. I was trying just to hang. I was trying to hang. You know, i'm trying to hang
[20888.31s -> 20893.05s]  It was a lot of fun. Glad you liked it
[20896.89s -> 20898.89s]  Yeah, vr veterans
[20899.29s -> 20904.30s]  vr vets
[20904.30s -> 20905.74s]  It is um
[20905.74s -> 20909.66s]  Is kiyo still streaming? Is kiyo streaming still?
[20910.22s -> 20917.22s]  Let's have a look. She just okay. She just added
[20917.94s -> 20923.38s]  Because I know someone saying that she was making a mind show clip or something and I was curious
[20939.19s -> 20945.35s]  She has the one with you in the mansion scene. Oh, wait. Did she add she added herself into the family dinner singing thing?
[20945.99s -> 20958.54s]  Do you feel like the obligation to be funny on vr chat?
[20960.07s -> 20963.35s]  is annoying
[20963.35s -> 20965.98s]  No, I mean I
[20965.98s -> 20967.98s]  I was just kind of just doing whatever
[20967.98s -> 20970.90s]  I don't think I had any obligation to do anything, you know
[20975.77s -> 20977.93s]  It was not the abc one. Oh, thank god
[20980.62s -> 20984.14s]  I think when you just actually walk around and you have like a
[20984.86s -> 20988.22s]  A bar and a few people that are just in character. It's fun just to kind of
[20990.09s -> 20992.09s]  Be insane for a little while, you know
[21008.12s -> 21010.76s]  Just five hours. Well, all of that wasn't you know
[21011.72s -> 21013.72s]  Making jokes and being like in character
[21014.66s -> 21020.74s]  I would say probably two-thirds of this stream was me just like staring going. What is that? What is happening?
[21026.68s -> 21029.64s]  you know, so it was a lot of me just taking it in and then some
[21030.36s -> 21033.08s]  obviously just
[21033.32s -> 21035.80s]  Improv bits that just kind of came up for no reason
[21036.52s -> 21045.58s]  But I don't find it to be like an annoying thing. I think it's fun
[21055.03s -> 21057.03s]  Coach hanging off your arm was amazing
[21059.50s -> 21062.70s]  It's just it's hard to take it in sometimes because it's just so out of control
[21063.26s -> 21066.46s]  And then you're like, hold on. Let me let me like I want to add something to this, right?
[21066.62s -> 21071.10s]  Plus I was like glue man. I got to be glue man for the I had to do it
[21071.82s -> 21081.29s]  Oh, here's the key. Well clip
[21084.65s -> 21090.66s]  Let's see. Let's watch it
[21091.30s -> 21092.26s]  Let's add it
[21092.26s -> 21094.34s]  Let's take a look. I think this is when we were doing a test
[21094.42s -> 21097.46s]  We were testing to see if this was gonna work earlier before the stream started
[21099.78s -> 21104.26s]  Whatever you finally made it
[21105.78s -> 21111.34s]  Welcome glad you finally accepted my my messages my calls
[21111.34s -> 21116.46s]  I wanted to invite you here today and it's it's so good to see you. Are you are you all right?
[21116.86s -> 21118.86s]  You're okay settling in
[21121.42s -> 21126.16s]  Welcome welcome to my my man and my virtual playground
[21126.86s -> 21128.86s]  I
[21128.94s -> 21130.94s]  You're gonna get a lot of trouble with that concrete
[21134.31s -> 21142.30s]  I was saying like I fell down and on her house and her front steps
[21142.78s -> 21145.58s]  And she's gonna get a concrete lawsuit because I fell down
[21147.14s -> 21149.14s]  vr face palming
[21155.11s -> 21166.14s]  It's all fun though, you know, but that's gonna be my time
[21167.22s -> 21169.22s]  I will see you guys tomorrow
[21175.62s -> 21177.93s]  Try out enter the gungeon
[21177.93s -> 21179.93s]  Uh, not right now. Not right now
[21180.57s -> 21182.57s]  Maybe eventually soon
[21183.10s -> 21186.09s]  maybe
[21186.09s -> 21189.66s]  But see you tomorrow guys
[21189.66s -> 21191.66s]  Uh not gonna be starting at like

[21193.18s -> 21196.95s]  pacific tomorrow gonna be starting at
[21198.50s -> 21200.50s]  This normal between like three and four
[21202.98s -> 21204.49s]  See you soon
[21204.49s -> 21209.85s]  Take care. Have a great rest of your night stream legends
[21210.57s -> 21214.09s]  Yep, thanks for the reminder. Let's activate it right now
[21226.94s -> 21228.94s]  There you go. Three two one
[21228.94s -> 21236.30s]  There you go. All right. Awesome. See you guys soon. Take care. Have a good one
