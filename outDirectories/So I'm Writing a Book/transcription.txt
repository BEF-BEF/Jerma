[5.37s -> 11.13s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a fistful of frags gameplay commentary.
[11.77s -> 16.25s]  It's been a while since you've seen fistful of frags on this channel, and there's no real
[16.25s -> 21.98s]  reason in particular for that. Sometimes you put a game away and you come back to it months later.
[21.98s -> 26.70s]  Sometimes you put a game away for potentially years, which I did with TF2. I stopped playing
[26.70s -> 34.47s]  TF2 back in like 2008 for like 12 months. You take breaks, point is, you take breaks,
[34.47s -> 38.07s]  you come back to games, and you go, well, you know, I forgot about this game. This game's
[38.07s -> 42.39s]  fucking sick. Yeah, well, that's what happened. I'm playing Fistful of Frags again. Here's a new
[42.39s -> 47.83s]  map, I believe. It's one of the new maps that's currently in circulation. It's a train. This is
[47.83s -> 51.67s]  all about the trains in Fistful of Frags, apparently. A lot of these maps, the newer
[51.67s -> 56.31s]  ones seem to have trains on them, but that's regardless of the point. You probably saw the
[56.31s -> 61.74s]  title and you're wondering what the hell this title means. Were you writing a book now? You
[61.74s -> 65.58s]  wanted to make a game company first. Now you want to write a book and then what you would do. Next
[65.58s -> 68.22s]  thing I'm going to want to be like an astronaut. I'm going to be like, gosh, hey, you know what?
[68.22s -> 71.90s]  Today's video, we're going to talk about how I want to be a fucking astronaut. And I'm going
[71.90s -> 76.30s]  to go up in the airplane. We're going to go flying up into outer space and I'm going to meet some
[76.30s -> 81.74s]  Martians and I'm going to start a family up there on Mars. No, but this is something I'm actually
[81.74s -> 86.38s]  doing right now. I'm in the process of doing, I'm writing a book. Yes, I'm writing a book. I'm an
[86.38s -> 91.82s]  ebook. Let's make that really clear. This is not going to be a published book by anybody.
[91.82s -> 96.06s]  You're not going to see this on store shelves at Barnes and Noble. There's not going to be an image
[96.06s -> 102.30s]  of me on the cover in a three-piece suit with my arm resting on a desk, smiling a giant white toothy
[102.30s -> 107.38s]  smile. And it's saying like, how to manage your finances with German nine eight five. It's just,
[109.38s -> 114.70s]  it's going to be something I'm doing for fun. And it's a choose your own adventure book.
[114.70s -> 119.98s]  I got really inspired recently by playing that game sorcery. That was a choose your own adventure
[119.98s -> 124.22s]  book. I'm sure a lot of you guys remember me talking how into what I was and how cool it was,
[124.22s -> 129.90s]  how I wished more people would be porting over game books. And then Inkle, the company that made
[129.90s -> 135.02s]  that game sorcery. Oh, well, they ported that game sorcery over to iOS and Android and shit.
[135.02s -> 140.22s]  They came up with this engine. There is an engine that they came up with for you to write your own
[140.22s -> 144.81s]  choose your own adventure books. So I saw that and I said, holy shit, are you kidding me? This is
[144.81s -> 149.85s]  awesome. I got to give this a try. I've got to at least try to do this. And yes, I know that there
[149.85s -> 153.93s]  are other resources and other places where you can write, choose your own adventure novels and
[153.93s -> 159.69s]  stuff. But this, I just knew the company Inkle. I played all their games and it looked really easy
[159.69s -> 165.29s]  to use. There's a, the tutorial was very, very simple. And I just started, I started writing
[165.29s -> 171.93s]  and I already have like probably like at least a few hundred words written so far. I don't know
[171.93s -> 178.09s]  what the timeframe will be on this. I can't just be telling you, oh yeah, well guys in three months,
[178.09s -> 183.77s]  I'm going to be having 5,000 pages done. I don't know the length. I don't even know the subject
[183.77s -> 189.45s]  matter. All I know is it's going to be an absurd adventure where you can go branching in a million
[189.45s -> 194.65s]  different directions. I'm going to make all kinds of just strange references to things and I'm not
[194.65s -> 199.61s]  going to take it that seriously. So if you're expecting out of this whole Germans writing a
[199.61s -> 204.49s]  book thing that you're going to get like George RR Martin presents like a song of ice and fire.
[205.21s -> 211.21s]  No, this is going to be just me writing my thoughts down and having some crazy adventure game
[211.21s -> 215.18s]  that you can just go on and mess around with and have a couple of laughs at maybe.
[215.18s -> 220.06s]  With that being said though, I do want it to be a coherent experience. I don't want to just write
[220.06s -> 227.66s]  like a third grader just like once upon a time, the princess was rescued from the alligator.
[227.66s -> 234.15s]  No, it's going to be a coherent story and I'm pulling trigger on it. So in the somewhat near
[234.15s -> 240.39s]  future, you might get a glimpse into some type of adventure free ebook that I'm going to write
[240.39s -> 246.60s]  and talking about free, talking about charging money for it and stuff. I don't know. I don't
[246.60s -> 253.24s]  think so. The only reason why I would ever charge money for this thing is if I literally like legit
[253.24s -> 260.02s]  put like 5,000 hours into writing it and it was like a really big fleshed out whole thing and
[260.10s -> 265.54s]  we'll just see how that goes. I have no idea what I'm doing. I have no clue what's going on,
[265.54s -> 270.34s]  which is why this is not a get rich quick scheme for me. I'm not just going to say,
[270.34s -> 274.98s]  Hey, wow, you know, I could just write a shit book that nobody's going to like.
[274.98s -> 282.50s]  And I'll just put like a $30 price tag on it. It's just an experiment that I'm doing.
[282.50s -> 285.78s]  And that's all I really have to say. I just wanted to mention that that's something I'm
[285.78s -> 289.06s]  working on right now. On top of all the other things that I'm doing in my life,
[289.06s -> 293.70s]  it's just kind of a life update. What are you doing video? And that's going to wrap it up. So
[293.70s -> 297.86s]  thanks everybody so much for watching. Really appreciate it. And I want to close this out by
[297.86s -> 302.90s]  saying this, right? If you want to try something like, look, I don't think I'm a writer. I don't
[302.90s -> 306.74s]  think so at all. I'm not one of those people that like I didn't go to school for it. I didn't learn.
[306.74s -> 311.90s]  I don't, I'm not a good like writer. Who gives a shit, right? Just, just try it. Just do it.
[311.90s -> 316.54s]  Even if you look at something and you go, you know, I can't do it. I would suck at that.
[316.70s -> 321.98s]  Try it. Just see, see if you do. Cause guess what? You might do it and go, holy shit, I'm the next
[321.98s -> 326.62s]  Edgar Allan Poe. And it would have said wandering weak and weary as a carpeting on my own
[326.62s -> 331.99s]  rainbow chamber door. You could be like really good at it is what I'm saying. And you never know.
[331.99s -> 335.99s]  Just try it. Even if it's anything, whatever it is, I would say, just go for it. You know me,
[335.99s -> 340.12s]  just fucking go for it and just bang. You know what I'm saying? Boom. And with that,
[340.12s -> 343.24s]  that's going to wrap it up. I'll see you all next time. Thank you all so much for watching.
[343.24s -> 348.28s]  I really do appreciate it and goodbye everybody. Take care and have a wonderful evening. Have a
[348.28s -> 351.64s]  wonderful night. Have a wonderful morning when you wake up. I hope you get a delicious breakfast.
