[0.31s -> 14.87s]  Oh, get away from me soldier. I'm doing my introduction. Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with face cam
[14.87s -> 20.35s]  Fortress 2 Monday's edition playing as the Scout on King the Hill nucleus
[20.35s -> 26.33s]  Hold on. I'm just trying to sneak up on him. You got to sneak up on him. Oh
[27.85s -> 35.92s]  He went falling down into hell. Yay. I didn't even tell you the setup. Whoa, this devil man is gonna get me
[35.92s -> 37.28s]  No, he's not
[37.32s -> 43.90s]  Hmm almost with the direct shot almost got me twice. Did he kill himself? No, he didn't
[46.78s -> 50.10s]  strange scatter gun the Mad Milk and the oh
[51.30s -> 53.30s]  I would have hit him so easily
[53.98s -> 59.58s]  And the Sandman I'm being all kinds of weird right now guys. We are we have the point we have the poor
[59.90s -> 64.72s]  God man, I almost got stuck. You are spy. Whoo
[65.28s -> 69.31s]  Alright, my heart just exploded. I thought the spy
[70.15s -> 74.20s]  Bumped into me and insta killed me. That was very very weird
[74.20s -> 79.11s]  Oh, but there's something I wanted to bring up in this video. I'm gonna talk about the gray man stuff
[79.79s -> 83.19s]  Not really into that much detail, but still it's it's pretty ridiculous
[83.19s -> 89.63s]  I can't wait to see what's going on with that if they introduce a new team into team fortress the gray team
[89.79s -> 95.56s]  Can you imagine the lunacy that that is going to accomplish like how much insanity is gonna happen with this game?
[95.80s -> 98.92s]  It's going to be unbelievable. Oh
[99.88s -> 104.80s]  No, I don't have the ball I just used it Oh nice shot with the ball you ball bag
[106.16s -> 114.19s]  There we are I needed that but there's a lot all kinds of theories going around
[114.75s -> 122.92s]  My particular theory if you want my theory on the gray man stuff. I think what's gonna happen. It's gonna be bots
[122.96s -> 125.90s]  It's gonna be non player controlled characters
[126.44s -> 131.40s]  Brand new player models that are not controlled by anybody and there's gonna be a massive amount of them
[131.76s -> 136.96s]  Hey, sorry for barging in like this interrupting face cam fortress 2. Sorry Jerma
[136.96s -> 142.20s]  We'll get back to you in a second, but this literally just came out less than one second ago
[142.20s -> 149.44s]  I rendered this video this face cam fortress video right after talking about the man versus machine stuff and the gray man stuff
[149.48s -> 154.92s]  This just came out. This is exactly what I was thinking was going to happen guys
[154.92s -> 160.08s]  It is the man versus machine update and it is going to be a brand new game mode
[160.08s -> 163.36s]  And it's going to be a huge huge huge deal
[163.36s -> 166.54s]  Now I there's a whole lot of information that I do not know right now
[166.54s -> 170.58s]  But I just wanted to let you guys know if you head over to the TF2 website TF2 calm
[170.58s -> 171.68s]  It's right on the front page
[171.68s -> 179.06s]  And yes, it is going to be a mode where you fight against waves and waves of a gray robot team
[179.10s -> 186.73s]  This is ridiculous and and depending on how many missions you complete and how many waves you survive you get probably hats
[186.73s -> 189.27s]  I think you're gonna be able to get this probably gonna be new weapons
[189.35s -> 194.77s]  It is going to be unreal and there's also a new movie too. There's a new source filmmaker movie
[194.77s -> 196.55s]  So I just wanted to butt in here for a second
[196.55s -> 201.17s]  I'll let you guys know about this because this is brand new information that I did not see or hear of
[201.35s -> 205.93s]  Until less than like 30 seconds ago, so we'll get back to face cam fortress 2 now
[206.15s -> 208.43s]  Hopefully man versus machine is going to be incredible
[208.43s -> 213.95s]  You can read all the biographies of all the new enemies all the new robots. There are giants
[213.95s -> 218.87s]  There are giant robot heavies in this update if you couldn't ask for anything more than that
[218.87s -> 222.75s]  I don't know what else you could ask for but you can see all the information in the links in the description
[222.75s -> 228.07s]  So yeah guys, we'll go back to team fortress face cam fortress 2 and I'll see you guys all soon. Take it away
[228.07s -> 234.76s]  Gerber so that's my theory if you want it if you want to hear what I have to say
[235.64s -> 244.43s]  About that same sniper. Oh, I'm coming for you, man. I'm coming for young. You're gonna have a bad day in a second
[244.43s -> 255.71s]  I'm gonna come eat you alive. Is he still there? No, he's not. He's dead. He's dead regardless
[256.03s -> 261.50s]  I'm gonna go the other way though. But yeah, I think it's gonna be bots. We shall see
[261.50s -> 267.15s]  I am anxiously awaiting what it possibly is. It's gonna be so much fun. Oh
[271.63s -> 276.30s]  There is there's a sniper bastard and he's dead. Yeah
[277.82s -> 287.91s]  We're gonna win I think we're gonna win. I really think we're going to win. Hey, man, you've got that invincibility on that's not fair
[288.77s -> 294.95s]  Whatever. I'll just go have fun. I feel like your birthday party. Did it not hit him? What is?
[296.41s -> 303.04s]  What's going on with this dude guy was acting really fishy. Hey, what's up? Hey, what's up sniper down?
[304.28s -> 309.84s]  Let us go again. The scout thinks he's gonna get me. He almost did though. That was the thing
[309.84s -> 317.81s]  He almost did get me. No, no, no, no, no get this pyro out of here. Nice job heavy. Nice job
[318.77s -> 322.00s]  you
[322.00s -> 324.00s]  Pyro, mr. Pyro

[334.19s -> 344.44s]  What's going on up here anything any any potty's going on any snipers any snipers that I can kill
[344.44s -> 346.44s]  Oh this guy down air spy
[347.16s -> 353.70s]  Landed right in his face. He's not dead. I would have got healed by that. That's not cool. That's not cool, man
[353.96s -> 358.98s]  Hey heavy, where's your like sandwich? Can I like swallow some of it? Oh
[365.32s -> 370.16s]  I just freaked that guy out. I bet you that guy really just said into it like
[371.08s -> 375.38s]  That's not good, that's not good. Oh my good good job
[376.18s -> 386.55s]  Good job, dude. That was a nice kill. You saw the opportunity saw what I was doing and you didn't let me do it
[386.55s -> 391.92s]  That's a good medic. Is this guy just like sniping people with the bison?
[393.38s -> 403.08s]  Yeah, he's killing people look at the top right. He is actually killing people with that. That's so awesome. Just sniping
[407.37s -> 411.47s]  Scout first scout. Oh
