[1.78s -> 8.33s]  Hey, what's going on? How are you? Yeah, I didn't want, I wasn't supposed to be late.
[9.78s -> 19.27s]  I don't know what the hell was going on with Steam. Steam was, I couldn't connect anything.
[20.07s -> 26.89s]  About, about to do an Elden Ring PC Steam PvP stream and they turned this off for maintenance.
[26.89s -> 34.95s]  They did that because I was streaming. That's why they did it. All right, so here's what we're
[34.95s -> 53.59s]  gonna do. Are you guys ready? Cancel the stream? No. We got an, this is exciting stuff today.
[53.59s -> 58.23s]  Today we're going to do Elden Ring PvP, but it's going to be a little different.
[61.66s -> 71.66s]  How it is different is I need to find champions. I need to find people that can fight
[72.38s -> 79.75s]  for this community and that can represent this community in a very meaningful way. Because in
[79.75s -> 87.66s]  a few days, tentatively, still ironing out the details, Ludwig and I are going to do an event
[88.30s -> 97.16s]  where we do a trial by combat. Ludwig is picking somewhere around five to seven people from his
[97.16s -> 103.91s]  community and I'm picking five to seven people from my community. And we're going to battle you.
[108.26s -> 115.46s]  Yes, trust me when I say I've been, I've been looking for the barf drinker. We may have a lead.
[116.18s -> 125.26s]  We may have a lead on the original barf drinker. I'll tell you right now, there are two slots that
[125.26s -> 132.31s]  I already have reserved. I just don't know where to find the other one. Then the problem with Elden
[132.31s -> 142.57s]  Ring, especially the multiplayer stuff, is if I ask, oh hey dude, who was this person in that stream?
[144.60s -> 152.84s]  5,000 of you are going to go to Rhea Lucaria and you're going to change your name and your outfit
[154.04s -> 164.94s]  to be that person. So this is going to be interesting. So what we have to do here,
[164.94s -> 171.34s]  this is the plan. These are tryouts. I have VR Josh here. He's in the game right now.
[171.34s -> 176.94s]  We're in the game. We are going to be summoning people. Sometimes it'll be a 1v1 scenario where
[176.94s -> 181.82s]  you will fight me. Maybe you'll fight Josh. Maybe we'll summon someone else and you'll fight each
[181.82s -> 194.87s]  other. I'm going to decide who I want to represent me in a few days. I'm ready for the guild tryouts
[195.83s -> 201.42s]  and not just me. I think you guys deserve to have a say in this too.
[209.80s -> 213.32s]  So we're going to pull people in and you're going to show us what you got.
[216.18s -> 219.94s]  It's either going to be yay or nay and then you're out and we're moving on to the next one.
[220.50s -> 233.75s]  Is this pre-recorded? Why would this be? What? Show me what you got. What's the rune level?
[234.31s -> 240.66s]  I think we're going to shoot for 125 probably. Your rune level doesn't matter right now.
[241.83s -> 245.83s]  As long as you're over 120, if you use the password we're going to give everybody
[246.55s -> 250.79s]  and it doesn't matter. But the nature of this stream, by the way, keep in mind,
[251.67s -> 255.11s]  I'm not going to summon the same person like three or four potentially times.
[256.46s -> 263.48s]  So we're going to go from here. If you get into the game, I know this is going to look,
[263.48s -> 267.24s]  there's probably going to be hundreds of signs down and I'm not going to get to them all.
[267.24s -> 270.52s]  So this is just going to be for fun. It's not meant to be taken seriously,
[271.24s -> 278.97s]  but I can assure you we will find a group today. How that's going to happen. Excuse me.
[280.79s -> 285.59s]  You are going to come into the game. People are asking, how the hell are you going to keep track?
[285.59s -> 290.79s]  Elden Ring does not keep track of that. Well, VR Josh is. VR Josh is going to have his recent
[290.79s -> 297.82s]  Steam players list. If you are to be considered, VR Josh is going to reach out to you and confirm
[297.82s -> 302.70s]  who you are in Discord. And obviously he's got your, you know, Steam profile, whatever.
[304.70s -> 310.97s]  That's the way we're going to do it. That's the easiest way. We were talking about like,
[310.97s -> 314.25s]  oh, should we just have people take like a screenshot with their hats off and like
[314.25s -> 323.19s]  hiding behind a cemetery or something? But people could just spoof that. So what about
[323.19s -> 334.10s]  reserves? Oh yeah. There'll be reserves. I'm going to pick 10 people today or maybe like seven. And
[334.10s -> 339.06s]  you're just, if three or four, you don't show up on whatever Friday or Saturday, whatever we
[339.06s -> 344.68s]  decide to do this, we'll try to make it so it can work with everybody. That's the plan. That's the
[344.68s -> 352.68s]  plan. Do you need my blood type? No. Are there Elden Ring spoilers? I haven't finished. Oh,
[355.24s -> 362.28s]  I can't even show you the screen. Um, that person, I just want to let you know. Yes, leave now
[362.28s -> 367.72s]  because I just looked up and this is what I saw. This is, yes, yes, absolutely. Um,
[367.72s -> 373.98s]  this is what I literally just saw. Hey dude, it doesn't happen to be Elden Ring spoilers.
[373.98s -> 387.61s]  Is there? No, not really. Ah, I wouldn't say so. I mean, I don't know. Come on. Nice hair. I have
[387.61s -> 393.10s]  to comb it. All right. So we're going to do a password. I'm going to tell you what it is.
[393.10s -> 398.71s]  I'll put it on the screen to make it easier so we can get started. We, we are currently in front
[398.71s -> 407.03s]  of the Church of Vows, the front door. I'm going to be putting down the, a, not the password we
[407.03s -> 414.41s]  were using before. This is PC. I'll make sure to put it in the, you know, in the list there.
[417.54s -> 429.00s]  All right. The multiplayer password is going to be no spaces, no capitals. Uh, trial by C.
[429.88s -> 441.00s]  Trial by C. Trial by combat. Trial by C. Don't worry. I'll spell it out for you. Trial by C.
[441.64s -> 450.66s]  Dr. Cheese is not what we're using today. I'm in front of the Church of Vows. Let me,
[450.66s -> 461.05s]  can I just comb my hair real quick? Is VR Josh even still in the game? Where is he? Josh,
[461.05s -> 469.32s]  you still here? Oh, Jesus. Okay. You are. All right. So we need, I need, I need gold signs
[470.28s -> 475.22s]  and I need invasion signs because how this works is there can only be two of each.
[475.94s -> 481.78s]  So right now Josh is an invader. So I need another invader and I need another gold sign. So
[481.86s -> 489.06s]  put down both. Messy hair. It's, I need a haircut. That's a problem. Uh, uh, mods.
[491.86s -> 498.25s]  Will this work if, uh, yeah, you should, you're still here, right? This should work
[498.25s -> 504.02s]  if we change the password. Soul level. Summoning people with a password doesn't matter. So level,
[504.02s -> 508.90s]  but for the actual tournament, we're probably going to say 125. That makes the most sense.
[509.46s -> 519.10s]  All right. Let me use this item. I'm not going to send him out. Am I? No. All right. Should I
[519.10s -> 529.26s]  be seeing signs or what? Do I have to do, do I have to take any other item? 125 is too low.
[529.26s -> 537.34s]  Is it too low? We'll figure out 150 is the new PVP cap. Oh, I need to take one of the fingers,
[537.34s -> 553.40s]  right? How come I can't take it? 150 is not. We'll figure it out. Password password's trial by sea.
[553.40s -> 569.70s]  Yes. I have to kill. Oh, I'll use the tongue. That means we can be invaded. Uh, is this, am I
[569.70s -> 573.62s]  going to be able to even have, I might have to just summon Josh, uh, with the same password, right?
[573.62s -> 582.31s]  Yeah. I'll put the password on screen. Good idea. Good idea. Is it cross region?
[582.87s -> 587.27s]  I think it's currently set to cross region, but I'm really going to have to disappoint everybody
[587.27s -> 597.74s]  here. I think, I think I'm only going to be picking North America. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[597.74s -> 602.22s]  In fact, I'm going to have to turn that off now. I'm so sorry, everybody. Like we got,
[602.22s -> 605.42s]  we're going to have a tournament here. It's, we're going to have to be able to connect to each other.
[605.42s -> 612.23s]  Should I leave and rejoin? Yeah. Try, try. Let's, uh, leave and rejoin. We'll see. Let me just, uh,
[612.79s -> 632.74s]  got it. Okay. So yeah, this is how it's going to work. Why am I wrong? Like, okay, there we go.
[632.74s -> 640.81s]  Uh, let me change the region and I'm going to reload the area too. So hold on. Let me do a cross
[640.81s -> 649.78s]  region off. I'm sorry. I know. Oh, it's already off. Okay. We're good. All right. So I need gold
[649.78s -> 656.81s]  signs and I need, uh, regular signs too. See if I could find Josh again, that's going to be hard.
[658.34s -> 662.90s]  I can do some trial, uh, trials by myself, but I really need to have that recent steam players
[662.90s -> 677.62s]  list. I have a question. Uh, go, go gold, Josh. It's all with the password, right? It's not me.
[677.62s -> 682.36s]  I'm gold. Hold on. Hold on. Yeah. With a tournament like this or having like a community fight a
[682.36s -> 687.00s]  community, I feel like we have to have it be no lag. If someone's just teleporting around,
[687.00s -> 694.28s]  I'm going to be like, what? Oh, we can't even do it. I'll put the info on screen. Bear with me
[694.28s -> 707.56s]  for just another second, please. Thank you. Okay. Uh, password is trial by combat and
[708.63s -> 714.82s]  rune level one 25 to one fifth. I, we haven't figured it out yet. It's probably, I gotta talk
[714.82s -> 727.62s]  to a lot of people. We're not sure yet. Uh, you see, all right, let's see if I can get Josh back
[727.62s -> 738.76s]  in here. Once Josh is in here, then we can really get going, but he really has to be in here first.
[738.76s -> 744.52s]  May restart it. One 25 is PVP one 50 or players who were too bad to beat the game without
[744.52s -> 764.20s]  over-leveling. Oh, stop. Stop it. Please. All right, Josh, where's your, uh, sign? It wasn't
[764.20s -> 770.90s]  there. All right. I got a question. So for me to see recent players that I've played with,
[770.90s -> 783.26s]  I can't see it. Is there a re what do I have to do? This person is just me. If I can find you here,
[783.26s -> 795.27s]  shift tab, like, okay, but you can't see it in Elden ring. No, you can. You can. We confirmed
[795.27s -> 805.06s]  that you could just do level 70. Yeah. Recent players does work now, but I can't see them
[805.06s -> 817.61s]  because it has to be like, why don't you just use it? Yeah. That's what I was going to say.
[817.61s -> 822.46s]  That's why I was trying to get Josh in here so he could see it. But trying to get, we thought
[822.46s -> 827.83s]  we could get Josh in first and then switch the password. Well, here's where, okay, I gotta,
[827.83s -> 830.95s]  I got a solution. What do I do? We think about this. I'm just not going to tell you what the
[830.95s -> 836.20s]  password is yet and get Josh and why would we not think about this first? That was like the eat.
[836.20s -> 840.95s]  What are we crazy? All right. New password. I'm just going to give it to Josh first.
[842.23s -> 846.57s]  What the fuck am I doing? What do you mean? I'm dumb. You didn't have the idea either.
[846.57s -> 852.33s]  You didn't have the idea either, did you? I just should have left it at the other one. I don't know
[852.33s -> 856.57s]  what the fuck we were doing. All right. New password. I'm typing it to Josh right now.
[856.57s -> 869.30s]  I don't want to show you this. How, guys, how are we going to do this? I don't know. I got to
[869.30s -> 877.43s]  get Josh in, then I got to change the world and I get what? Just the easiest problems have the
[877.43s -> 881.75s]  whatever. It's the most difficult solutions have, I don't, whatever they, you know, the quote from
[881.75s -> 887.91s]  that fucking movie with the guys in space throwing lasers and shields and stuff. All right. Let me
[887.91s -> 900.71s]  turn this off. Okay. I'm going to put that. I'm going to put the password down now. I'm excited
[900.71s -> 907.48s]  for this. I don't. I'm very ready for this. Why did we fucking do that? What were you doing?
[907.48s -> 915.70s]  Why would there be a separate password for Josh to come in? Okay. Yeah. Josh, we're going to change
[915.70s -> 928.62s]  that password again. Mine was too long. That one's the one we're using. That's the one we're using.
[930.06s -> 939.93s]  All right. Are you guys ready? Let's go. That's not the password. I could change that too.
[939.93s -> 944.55s]  All right. Here we go. Takes a little bit of setup. We're good. We're not ready. Yeah. I know. Hold
[944.55s -> 948.87s]  on. Let me just, he's in a weird mood again. I, yeah, I am because I'm excited. This is going to
[948.87s -> 963.78s]  be fun. All right. Looking for your sign. Where'd you put it? So here's the plan. We are going to,
[964.34s -> 975.77s]  we are going to do this for a little while. After we pick a few champions, after we get who I think
[975.77s -> 983.58s]  is, should be there. I'm going to play Closing Shift. It's a horror game. It's area game. It's
[983.58s -> 990.14s]  everybody make coffee or something. All right. I can officially now show the password on screen
[990.14s -> 993.10s]  and I can. All right. We're good. We're good. It just takes a minute. Everyone just relax. We're
[993.10s -> 1012.36s]  fine. Password is not trial by combat anymore. Password is frogs LUL. That is the password.
[1012.36s -> 1026.26s]  Good luck everybody. What the fuck? No, wait, why are we getting invaders? Why are we getting
[1026.26s -> 1032.71s]  invaders? I got a password. All right. We got to kill this guy like quick. Josh, try as hard as
[1032.71s -> 1048.06s]  you can and kill him now. Get this guy. Get him. Okay. All right. Okay. Why can't I see anything?
[1048.06s -> 1054.74s]  Where's my HUD? Why is my HUD off? Who turned my fucking HUD off? Why is my HUD turned off?
[1059.24s -> 1066.50s]  What? Who would do? Why would that be turned off? Oh, right. I did. All right. Here we go.
[1066.50s -> 1081.83s]  You guys ready? Our first contestant, Goob. Welcome Goob. Goob, we're going to have you facing,
[1081.83s -> 1099.08s]  let's pick another one here. Passwords don't affect invasions. I thought you had to take the tongue
[1099.08s -> 1104.44s]  because if you're, Oh, right. Anyone can just invade the game. I forgot. Welcome Goob. Let's
[1104.44s -> 1110.55s]  take a look at you. See if I think I would want you as a, as a champion of mine. Rivers of blood.
[1111.11s -> 1116.23s]  Rivers of blood. That's an automatic disqualification. Um, thanks for playing. Josh,
[1116.23s -> 1124.92s]  if you could take care of him, please. Oh, you're not an invader. All right. You're going to be
[1124.92s -> 1132.14s]  going against, who's this? All right. Wrangledorf. Wrangledorf. I should turn off the HUD. Why is it
[1132.14s -> 1142.68s]  on? So these are our first two. Remember, I'm looking, I'm not just looking for people that
[1142.68s -> 1150.09s]  can play the game well. I'm wait, don't, don't, not yet. Oh, I'm not looking for like, Oh wow.
[1150.09s -> 1154.09s]  What a gamer. I'm looking for people that can, you know, be able to, it's not just about like how
[1154.09s -> 1163.96s]  many times you can hit R1, right? Where is, um, look his HUD. All right. Now I want my thing.
[1163.96s -> 1170.86s]  All right. So here we go. Let me take a look at you. Not bad. Hey, don't fight yet. Don't fight.
[1170.86s -> 1175.02s]  That's unsportsmanlike conduct from Goob. And I don't think I'm not, I'm not happy about this.
[1175.66s -> 1189.64s]  That's unsportsmanlike conduct. What am I doing? No, I want to look, where's my binoculars?
[1192.06s -> 1201.03s]  There it is. All right. I want, I, uh, first of all, Goob, I don't, I'm not, I'm not entirely
[1201.03s -> 1203.75s]  happy about what you just did, but I'm ready to start the fight here. If you guys could,
[1203.75s -> 1207.35s]  this is a, to see who may or may not be moving on. I'll consider everything.
[1207.35s -> 1216.38s]  You can go ahead and fight. You can go ahead and start now. I'm looking for a lot of different
[1216.38s -> 1228.90s]  things. I'm looking at the comedy. I'm looking at the skill. I need to back the camera up.
[1239.78s -> 1245.38s]  All right. River of Blood is banned. If you come, I'm telling, I'm going to tell you right now,
[1245.38s -> 1250.34s]  if you come into the trial by combat tryouts with Rivers of Blood and you kill the guy in three hits,
[1250.34s -> 1260.78s]  you're banned. Rivers of Blood's banned. That was cool though. That was pretty cool. I like the
[1260.78s -> 1266.12s]  armor. I like the getup. I like the idea. Uh, but we have, I mean, we have to find someone that can
[1266.12s -> 1287.03s]  get rid of you. All right. Drew Crew for life. You've, you got a catchy name. Rivers Crew. No,
[1287.03s -> 1293.96s]  no, no. If you, I, you, you, you're trying to impress me. I'm sorry, but you don't impress me
[1293.96s -> 1301.77s]  by hitting L2 three times, but wait a minute. It could be some redemption here. You forgot to call
[1301.77s -> 1310.49s]  us Drew Crew for a year. Okay. I'm not against having somebody with Rivers of Blood by the way.
[1310.49s -> 1324.65s]  Okay guys, go for it. Let me see what you can do. Let me see what you got. I like the weapon choice.
[1327.26s -> 1343.30s]  Oh my goodness. Crawl. All right. Okay. That was actually amazing. Congratulations. You're the first
[1343.30s -> 1347.06s]  person that's being considered, but not quite yet. We're going to have to have the, we're going to
[1347.14s -> 1357.45s]  have to have the chat vote on you, I think. All right. We need, uh, we need another gold sign.
[1358.01s -> 1370.47s]  We've got Drew Crew looking good. We need some gold signs. I might need to, uh,
[1370.47s -> 1386.49s]  okay. There we go. Who's this? Okay. Anna. Anna, go for it. Put on Tekken music. And by the way,
[1386.49s -> 1390.15s]  the environments are going to change too. We're not just going to sit here. Like I have to see
[1390.15s -> 1397.48s]  how people can handle this. Uh, yeah. Can we please keep, um, like, can we please keep the Drew Crew
[1397.48s -> 1410.57s]  for later review, please? That's for later review. Okay. Anna, let's see what you got.
[1414.89s -> 1429.62s]  Please help. That's funny. Uh, you two can go ahead and get started whenever you want.
[1429.62s -> 1449.26s]  Good. Oh shit. Fire move. That move is sick. What just happened? What the fuck was that?
[1456.04s -> 1478.25s]  Okay. You killed me. No, no, we have to redo this. No. I have to, I have to re-summon Josh
[1478.89s -> 1489.38s]  with a new password. All right. Put that one on the consideration list. Put that one on the
[1489.38s -> 1499.86s]  consideration list for sure. All right. We're going to move area. Drew Crew is currently saved.
[1499.86s -> 1509.48s]  We're going to pull them out later too. Uh, Drew Crew, if you're here, I would stick around. Uh,
[1509.48s -> 1515.37s]  but I need to make a new password and we're going to move area too. Uh, let's go over here. Let's
[1515.37s -> 1529.59s]  go. What's a place that like not a lot of people will be that's like kind of open in the snow area?
[1529.59s -> 1537.13s]  What about, yeah, what about like right here somewhere? Lindell? Outer wall of Lindell?
[1538.76s -> 1543.72s]  Yeah, that's probably not a bad idea. Like you mean like out here? Like at the rampart?
[1543.72s -> 1550.42s]  What do you mean like in here somewhere? Is 156 a room? Look, the room level doesn't really matter
[1550.42s -> 1557.98s]  that much. We're, we're trying to find some community champions here. Play Radegon's theme
[1557.98s -> 1575.90s]  during battles. Okay. I like that a lot. At least for a few. Uh, the one left. Okay. Let me get a
[1575.90s -> 1586.04s]  new password for Josh and then that password's changing. All right. New password. It turns off.
[1586.04s -> 1599.22s]  The one left near the outer wall. Do I even have the outer wall? Okay. Yeah. Outer,
[1599.22s -> 1603.40s]  outer wall battleground is where we're going to go. I gotta get a new password.
[1609.99s -> 1616.49s]  You killed me, man. I'm not gonna have to consider that. It's so funny because there's no way we're
[1616.49s -> 1620.81s]  going to actually get like, oh yeah, let's get like some like people to do that. I'm just picking
[1620.81s -> 1625.13s]  like the five like fucking biggest dickheads and like that's who's going in. It doesn't really
[1625.13s -> 1629.62s]  matter. It's just for fun. All right. New password. I got to change it. I don't want you guys to see.
[1632.57s -> 1638.54s]  New lake of rot. Yeah. Guys, I'm, trust me when I say this is going to be very, very,
[1638.54s -> 1645.02s]  we have to consider a lot. Once we narrow down some people, we're putting them in weird scenarios.
[1645.02s -> 1652.79s]  We're putting these people in strange scenarios. So don't worry. I, I gotta give Josh this new
[1652.79s -> 1675.75s]  password so we can log. Um, this is fine. Okay. That's the password, Josh. Use it. I'll get you
[1675.75s -> 1687.62s]  in and then I'll show it on stream. And I am right here, Josh, by the way. This is an interesting
[1687.62s -> 1694.06s]  place because there's a lot, this, um, verticality here, this area right down here. I think it's
[1694.06s -> 1709.30s]  perfect. You can be outside of it by a few levels. Uh, all right. I need to wait. I need to press the
[1709.30s -> 1733.61s]  button. Yeah. You can be outside of it. Where is, where's your sign, Josh, the fire, get the right
[1733.61s -> 1749.26s]  password, right? I hope I have the right password. I sent it to you, right? I need to reset it. Yeah.
[1749.26s -> 1776.54s]  Hey, you love the drew crew. Not yet. Hmm. Ah, no. What? I rewrote it. Let's try it again. If there's
[1776.54s -> 1785.77s]  no boss, you need a red summon sign first. Really? Oh, I didn't know that. Uh, Josh, it's
[1785.77s -> 1805.61s]  going to be red. And then I need to summon a red and a gold. That's a lie. Rest until night, but
[1805.61s -> 1815.51s]  until like noon or something. Oh, that is true. Okay. That was a lie. I feel like it's not a lie
[1815.51s -> 1839.98s]  because I can't see his sign. Use the finger. Didn't I already do it? I was reset it. Why does
[1839.98s -> 1851.93s]  it hate this place? Why does it hate this place? Maybe I gotta move. All right. Well, it doesn't
[1851.93s -> 1870.82s]  like this place. Um, how about up here? Will this work? Consecrated Snowfield? I can't believe I
[1870.82s -> 1881.78s]  fucking killed. This should work, right? Or the Radon Festival. Oh, that's a great idea. Yeah.
[1881.78s -> 1895.70s]  We'll go over there. You leaked the password? No, I didn't. Yeah. We'll go like right over here.
[1895.70s -> 1906.97s]  That sounds good. I pay a laugh. I can't summon here. What the fuck? All right. So what's the
[1906.97s -> 1925.51s]  thing to show the PVP areas? You, you're lying. It's like, look, what do you mean? Just go to the,
[1925.51s -> 1928.15s]  yeah, we're just going to go. All right. We're just going to go to an area where you can actually do
[1928.15s -> 1941.54s]  it. Church of vows is, it's kind of cramped. Academy main gate. The Academy main gate is
[1941.54s -> 1950.09s]  going to be so flooded with signs though, but sure we'll start there. That's a guarantee that
[1950.09s -> 1959.53s]  we can at least do it somewhere pretty early might be helpful for new game plus. That's true. Not
[1959.53s -> 1964.33s]  with a password. All right. Let's go to the, let's go to the main gate. I wanted to like do it in
[1964.33s -> 2001.35s]  interesting places though. All right, Josh, put it down on the main gate. Maybe an isolated merchant
[2001.35s -> 2011.05s]  shack. You need a boss to summon golds. I feel like I need a Wikipedia to play multiplayer in
[2011.05s -> 2028.07s]  these games. I always liked that. No, I already did. Okay. Sign should be done. No, I killed the
[2028.07s -> 2032.38s]  bosses that were in, um, in front of the church of vows. I, I did everything there. This isn't
[2032.38s -> 2042.79s]  new game plus or anything. I don't think. Let me see if I have the password right. I'd like a team
[2042.79s -> 2053.94s]  of 10 people to help do this. Yeah, that's the right password. No, no caps, no spaces, just that
[2053.94s -> 2069.80s]  word. And then that number, it just works. I have no idea why it's not working. Maybe we have to
[2069.80s -> 2074.68s]  just do it at the church of vows. I, it's, I, I don't get why I wouldn't, why I was working there.
[2074.68s -> 2083.98s]  All right. We're just going to go where it worked because it does not work here. I, for some reason
[2083.98s -> 2106.17s]  let's go back to the church of vows. Why would it work there though? That's weird. It's because of
[2106.17s -> 2115.21s]  the, I didn't kill the boss. There's a secret boss here. Oh, what the fuck? Okay. I'm very irritated
[2115.21s -> 2123.86s]  by this, by the way. Very irritated. I just want to play multiplayer. What the heck is going on
[2123.86s -> 2130.97s]  here? All right. We have to do it in a place where I have not killed a boss. Apparently there's a boss
[2130.97s -> 2142.87s]  here at night that I didn't kill yet. Holy smokes. Haven't put a red down. Yeah, that didn't work
[2142.87s -> 2158.68s]  either. Why was this working flawlessly last time we did this? All right. There we go. All right.
[2158.68s -> 2164.68s]  Let's go. All right. The password, the password is cookies three. Okay. It's fucking cookies three
[2164.68s -> 2197.46s]  from software. Jesus. So we need gold and red. Whatever you want to put down, please do it.
[2197.46s -> 2211.90s]  It gets cut off. No, it doesn't. Cookies three. What do you mean? All right. Who do we got? Oh,
[2211.90s -> 2221.00s]  here comes, here comes cinnamon. What? The three is cut off. How would the three be cut off if I
[2221.00s -> 2234.81s]  have it right here? What? Oh, I'm mad right now. All right, Josh, we have an invader and they're
[2234.81s -> 2243.93s]  going to fuck this whole thing up. So, uh, are you, are you, okay. Point to the ground if you are
[2243.93s -> 2263.61s]  wanting to be considered to be a champion. Josh, get him, get him, get him. This is random invader.
[2267.18s -> 2274.79s]  Get him. Don't let him screw this up. How are you? Wait, what? You can't find the emote.
[2275.51s -> 2279.72s]  All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let up, let up, let up, let up, let up for a second, Josh.
[2281.05s -> 2290.87s]  Point. Okay. Point to the ground if you want to be considered. He doesn't have the emote. How do
[2290.87s -> 2296.38s]  you, don't you get that in like the first fucking 10 minutes of the game? All right. Do an emote
[2296.38s -> 2299.82s]  if you want to be, there we go. All right. You want to be considered. That's fine. Let's get somebody
[2299.82s -> 2309.85s]  to fight you. What do you know what your name is? Cinnamon. All right. Do we have a fire, fire, fire,
[2309.85s -> 2323.75s]  fire? I'm interested. That's rude. I don't know. Somebody could just invade and kill us both and
[2323.75s -> 2342.92s]  we have to redo the whole thing again, man. Hey. All right. I wish you both the absolute best of luck
[2344.18s -> 2392.49s]  and get started. Pretty cool. Oh shit. That was fucking pretty cool. All right. Stick around,
[2392.49s -> 2399.80s]  stick around for now. We need some red signs. This camera work is why you'd never worked out
[2399.80s -> 2411.56s]  as a wedding photographer. Listen, I, I just imagined like, I don't know why somebody would
[2411.56s -> 2416.12s]  have like, like their wedding video would have the Radegon theme for some reason.
[2417.77s -> 2423.74s]  Like you really like this game. All right. We need some red signs. What do we got here? Who's this?
[2425.66s -> 2446.14s]  Storm blessed. Maybe, maybe metal mesh. Zeke. Maybe there's Wrangledorf again,
[2446.14s -> 2463.26s]  Rachel convo breaker. Hmm. What do you guys think? Convo breaker sounds like a good idea.
[2463.26s -> 2471.38s]  All right guys, let me get a good spot. I need something like kind of high up, like up here.
[2476.92s -> 2489.77s]  Can I get like up on the roof somehow? Up on the rock. All right. Don't do anything yet.
[2489.77s -> 2499.21s]  I'm going to get up on the rock. Maybe I should get on this rock over here.
[2499.77s -> 2507.75s]  I love, we got to, we got to take a look at you. Hey, going on convo breaker. You two, uh, currently
[2507.75s -> 2516.86s]  this is a pretty interesting consideration here. Give up the hillside. All right. Follow me. This
[2516.86s -> 2534.55s]  is where we're putting the signs down now. I'm going to get up here. That's way better. Yeah,
[2534.55s -> 2540.90s]  that's better. All right. Once you start hearing the music that you guys can start to get started
[2540.90s -> 2562.09s]  here. Good luck. Congratulations. Uh, have a good fight. Oh, they, all right. They both have
[2562.09s -> 2582.06s]  similar moves. Oh, that was huge. Nice job convo breaker. Fire, fire, fire. I want to put you on
[2582.06s -> 2589.96s]  the considered list though. Excellent work. Let's get you in again. I want to get another look at
[2589.96s -> 2600.14s]  you. Are potions allowed? Yeah. Fuck it. Yeah. You can drink potions. Who cares? These are triodes,
[2600.14s -> 2613.13s]  right? You can drink potions. Yeah. Just chug them. Who gives a fuck? By the way, uh, convo breaker.
[2613.13s -> 2617.77s]  Um, we're going to eventually, we're going to, when we narrow this down a little bit more,
[2618.33s -> 2627.37s]  we might be in contact. It was like a fucking college application, like a job application.
[2627.37s -> 2630.89s]  By the way, we'll be in contact shortly. Potentially. Maybe not. Don't call us though.
[2630.89s -> 2635.45s]  We may get in touch with you. We're thinking about it. Be aware. We might reach out. What the fuck am
[2635.45s -> 2649.14s]  I talking about? I need some signs. Gold signs. Let's see what we got. What's your name? You got
[2649.14s -> 2659.34s]  a pretty crazy setup. So I'm going to, we'll go ahead and say, yeah, we'll call you. Don't allow
[2659.34s -> 2685.90s]  healing. No Estes. No, anything, anything goes. Stay in one spot. Well, I don't see any signs here.
[2685.90s -> 2695.35s]  Hey. All right. Come on over here. You're going up against convo breaker. Uh, come a little bit
[2695.35s -> 2707.96s]  further back. The rock. Estes isn't fair. Uh, yeah. I mean, we're not, um, we're trying to see how you
[2707.96s -> 2718.33s]  handle certain scenarios, scenarios. Okay. Uh, good luck to you. We'll get you the music. Once
[2718.33s -> 2744.98s]  you hear the music, you go ahead and start. Got a gun here. Not a bad start. That's the spinning
[2744.98s -> 2761.50s]  wheel, the pizza wheel. All right. We've got, we've got a contender here. Uh, I think we have quite
[2761.50s -> 2774.42s]  a contender. Use a controller. Yeah. The issue is it's like alt tabbing. What does it shift? How do
[2774.42s -> 2785.67s]  I like make it so I don't have to cycle, right? The person that stays has less Estes. That's true.
[2785.67s -> 2791.27s]  If tab, right? Just don't alt tab. But I need to play the music. All right. Let's grab another
[2791.27s -> 2795.43s]  one. Uh, any signs over here yet? Not really. I think they're all going to concentrate over here.
[2801.27s -> 2805.67s]  I'm telling you right now, uh, convo breaker, if you go three for three here, I'm going to have to
[2805.67s -> 2820.97s]  very put you at the top of the list to wildly consider it. Your own battle music. I mean,
[2820.97s -> 2829.50s]  three for three. That's a big deal. Um, I don't see any more signs. Reuse the item. Uh, I think
[2829.50s -> 2835.64s]  we have to refresh after this, which is fine. It looks like we're bringing in Zeke. Oh, no. Hold
[2835.64s -> 2860.84s]  on. Yeah. All right. Zeke, come on and play the flute for battle music. It's this is Zeke, the
[2860.84s -> 2877.53s]  freak plays Shito. I don't even, I don't even know where she is. All right. Come over to the rock.
[2877.53s -> 2887.06s]  All right. We got convo breaker versus Zeke, the freak. This is to solidify. Convo breaker
[2887.06s -> 2900.76s]  is going to be absolutely considered. I'm very curious about it. Let's see. Good luck. Somebody
[2900.76s -> 2914.47s]  has to, uh, no, no, get that shit out of here. It's going to kill me. Get that out of here.
[2914.47s -> 2934.78s]  Get that out of here. Oh my God. Convo breaker might actually be unbeatable. Josh is just running
[2934.78s -> 2950.97s]  back and forth. All right. Zeke convo breaker. That was, that was quite the display. I wonder
[2950.97s -> 2965.00s]  if there's any more signs. I never told them to start. I said, what's the dog doing? Oh, wait,
[2965.00s -> 2983.96s]  hold on. We got some more. Hold on. Wait a minute. Scum. The fanatic. Somebody has to beat convo
[2984.04s -> 2993.54s]  breaker. Can we just put signs down? Yes. Uh, people are wondering where we are. We are in
[2993.54s -> 3002.04s]  front of the church of vows. So level one 25 to one 50 ish. I mean, it really doesn't matter that
[3002.04s -> 3016.06s]  much. All right. Scum. Scum. You are, first of all, you've already got the look down. You're like a
[3016.06s -> 3026.47s]  weirdo. So you've already, where are you? Where are you going? Oh, okay. You're going the right way.
[3026.47s -> 3037.99s]  Don't go yet. All right. It's kind of a weirdo. Where's the barf drinker? Where is it? Where is
[3037.99s -> 3042.90s]  the barter? If you're like looking for Batman or something, like where is Batman? All right. Hold
[3042.90s -> 3045.70s]  on one second. You know when to start. You're going to start when the music starts playing and
[3045.70s -> 3056.06s]  hold on. I'll tell you when that is. That's going to be in about five, four, one, zero convo breaker
[3056.06s -> 3085.88s]  is three for three. Can scum drinker be able to do it? Badness. Oh, shit. Oh no. They're too far.
[3085.88s -> 3101.99s]  Oh, did he get him? Oh my God. Nobody can beat him. He's scared. Nobody can beat him.
[3111.26s -> 3119.06s]  Nobody can beat him. Somebody said I can beat him. We need gold signs down with that password.
[3119.06s -> 3136.68s]  Cookies three convo breaker. Um, we might actually have the first champion looking good so far.
[3138.92s -> 3148.63s]  We don't need the telescope view. I, yeah, but I like it. All right. We've got Xena of dragons
[3148.63s -> 3167.43s]  possible. Young replica. Villabalt. Arcturus. All right. Xena of dragons. Somebody has to be
[3167.43s -> 3188.30s]  convo breaker. It's starting to get to be nightfall. He just walked past my sign. I don't
[3188.30s -> 3196.50s]  worry. I'm going to get as many people as I can. All right. I'm a breaker. How do you feel? I need
[3196.50s -> 3214.86s]  to turn this music down. We've got our own music. All right. Come on over here. Xena of dragons.
[3214.86s -> 3220.82s]  Welcome to the tryouts. I think you understand the rules here. You're going up against the
[3220.82s -> 3229.43s]  strongest champion that's shown themselves so far. That is convo breaker. I will get up here and
[3229.43s -> 3236.66s]  I'm going to tell you when to get. Uh, come a little bit closer to the rock to start. Yeah,
[3236.66s -> 3244.30s]  you can be like 150 plus. It don't matter. Turn on cross region play. Uh, back up a little bit
[3244.30s -> 3255.67s]  towards the, uh, towards the rock. Keep coming. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up.
[3255.67s -> 3259.59s]  Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. They're just going. They're going.
[3259.59s -> 3281.86s]  I don't know what happened. I don't know what just happened.
[3286.28s -> 3297.13s]  You did it. You killed convo breaker. That was a false start. Josh, you look fucking crazy.
[3300.65s -> 3310.18s]  All right. Let's get, um, we need, uh, uh, that was cheating. All right. We got invaded. We got
[3310.18s -> 3320.62s]  invaded by trash. Everyone be on your absolute lookout here. Be on your absolute. This three of
[3320.62s -> 3326.36s]  us just be aware. This person might not have any idea what we're doing. If we could get a confirmation
[3326.36s -> 3332.38s]  from trash that they are here to compete in the competition, that would be fantastic. If we could
[3332.38s -> 3348.50s]  get an emo of you pointing down. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Come over to the rock.
[3348.50s -> 3354.81s]  Nobody start yet. If you start, you're disqualified right in front of the rock.
[3360.18s -> 3366.68s]  Those bugs look up with the bugs. All right. Oh, come over to the rock. Close to the rock.
[3366.68s -> 3397.74s]  Guys, I'm trying to. All right. You can now begin the battle. Good luck to both of you.
[3397.74s -> 3413.26s]  I can't see anything. All right. I can't zoom in anymore. Wait, maybe I can. How are you killing
[3413.26s -> 3424.71s]  people so fast? Here's the issue. The issue is it's like 0.0.02 sensitivity. How do I make it
[3424.71s -> 3433.32s]  faster? Can I make the sensitivity faster for the camera? Yeah. Like, come on, dude. Like,
[3433.32s -> 3447.83s]  what the fuck is going on here? That's better. All right. Finally. All right. Zena now is currently
[3447.83s -> 3456.65s]  in the lead. Lock on to one of the fighters. Can you move when you're in this? Yeah, I can't move.
[3456.65s -> 3464.41s]  I can't move around. Well, not. There's no lead. Yeah, there's no such thing as a lead.
[3464.41s -> 3476.50s]  Okay. Sanders. Sanders. Come on in. See if you can beat Zeno and let me turn this off because
[3476.50s -> 3487.91s]  it's annoying and makes loud sounds. Yeah. I want to be like not even here. Isn't there a
[3487.91s -> 3500.63s]  weapon that makes so I'm silent too? Isn't this something that makes you quiet? Okay. This one
[3500.63s -> 3511.35s]  here. Okay. So good luck to you, Sanders. Good luck to you, Zeno. Both of you are in it to win
[3511.35s -> 3536.23s]  it here. You can go ahead and get started whenever you both comfortable. Oh, my God. Good start.
[3539.96s -> 3553.43s]  That thing is instantly killing it. I'm on their team. It's okay. All right. This is a bubble
[3553.43s -> 3568.44s]  character. Oh, you're dead. It's over. Oh, no. You definitely rotted by now. Fucking move, dude.
[3569.00s -> 3593.91s]  Is that ever going to hit? Oh, man. Okay. Zena now is really difficult. Sanders is dead. Nice try.
[3593.91s -> 3601.50s]  What level is Zena? That's a good quick. Could you be like, it's not possible for Zena to be
[3601.50s -> 3614.63s]  like level like 500, right? Oh, yeah. Let's go. Nancy Drew. I need Nancy Drew's fucking theme song,
[3614.63s -> 3631.91s]  whatever it is. Ladies and gentlemen, you're competing for the first time.
[3632.71s -> 3653.62s]  Nancy Drew. Hey. Okay. Nancy Drew, meet Zena, the dragon, who will win this Nancy Drew,
[3653.62s -> 3674.09s]  just a detective, just a detective in high school or a dragon warrior princess. Good luck. Begin.
[3688.92s -> 3695.80s]  Oh, that's so much distance. Come on, go over there and solve the mystery.
[3702.34s -> 3717.80s]  Nancy Drew. Just that's like a fucking leg of a chair. Oh, shit. This is all that's in Nancy
[3717.80s -> 3738.47s]  Drew's inventory. I've got a piece of a fence. Nancy Drew's dead. All right. I think Zena's got
[3738.47s -> 3757.27s]  to be considered. Looks like she couldn't solve that mystery. No, nobody's got to come in.
[3757.27s -> 3766.07s]  Is Zena over leveled? I don't know. Maybe. I don't know. Magic is good. Put HUD on for damage
[3766.07s -> 3777.37s]  numbers. How do you check level? Is level scaling if you use a password? Apparently,
[3777.37s -> 3784.36s]  she's level 125. Yeah, she's not over level. She's not 713. All right. Any more signs or we're going
[3784.36s -> 3802.01s]  to have to refresh? Oh, there's a bunch in here, isn't there? This is PC. Yeah, we need to refresh.
[3803.00s -> 3806.70s]  It should scale. All right. Yeah. So we shouldn't be a problem then. All right. We're going to have
[3806.70s -> 3815.42s]  to refresh. Zena, please take Zena's name down. They're going to be considered. Considered.
[3815.42s -> 3839.21s]  You have no U.S. friends. What? Okay. Zena, you're going to have to help her. Minus what?
[3839.21s -> 3874.34s]  Tip? Should I put clothes on? To the right, to the right, to the right. Good sir. Are you here
[3874.34s -> 3901.16s]  for the Tournament of Champions? All right. Let's start this. That was like a little kid
[3901.16s -> 3906.76s]  just wandered over. That was just like, what was that? We were like, we were like, some just kid
[3906.76s -> 3920.33s]  just walked over. He's like, what are you guys doing over here? What the fuck was that? Disqual.
[3920.33s -> 3938.02s]  All right. Stinky. I got high hopes that Stinky. Where's the barf drinker? We need to put a bat
[3938.02s -> 3952.07s]  signal up in the sky for the barf drinker. Do you want me to DM barf drinker? Yes. All right, Stinky.
[3952.07s -> 3959.02s]  Good luck. Come over here. You're probably going to die in one hit. That was so funny.
[3959.98s -> 3969.62s]  This shield and sword didn't even die. We couldn't even say hello. All right, Stinky. Let's go.
[3970.18s -> 3976.60s]  I'm very curious. Let's make it happen. You are going up against the strongest character so far,
[3976.60s -> 3995.94s]  besides Convo Breaker. I don't think you're going to win. I don't think you're going to win. All right.
[3995.94s -> 3999.46s]  I'm going to tell you guys something like, I understand the comedy points work, but when you
[3999.46s -> 4008.22s]  come in here with like toys and you're going to get killed. This guy's using a sticky hand
[4008.22s -> 4034.97s]  from one of those quarter machines. Wait a minute. Don't speak so soon. Watch out for the... Uh-oh.
[4034.97s -> 4054.58s]  I was facing the wrong way. Easy. Stinky. This has been the hardest fight so far for Zena.
[4054.58s -> 4067.05s]  What the hell was that? Holy shit. Stinky, you got it. That's unbelievable. Nice job. Zena,
[4067.05s -> 4083.21s]  nice job to you too. Stinky, let's see what you got. I'll keep Zena's name down as well.
[4083.21s -> 4096.20s]  Stinky did Estus three times. Not a good showing. I keep thinking about the Linus guy.
[4096.20s -> 4104.33s]  He didn't even have a chance. All right. And we need a, uh, I need a gold sign.
[4105.88s -> 4109.38s]  We're going to have to refresh it in a second and, uh, bring in some new people
[4117.05s -> 4131.64s]  because I want to get a cycle. Gold sign right here. Okay. Well, we've got, we've got a, um,
[4131.64s -> 4138.76s]  what we have here is we have Frosted Flakes and then next to Frosted Flakes is the off-brand
[4138.76s -> 4148.25s]  Frosted Flakes that, that nobody buys. What's going on? Except, hold on a second here. Some
[4148.25s -> 4155.21s]  of those off-brand cereals that come with the huge bags are better. Buy like a lot. They're
[4155.21s -> 4164.47s]  gone though. I don't know where they went. You could buy like a year's worth of cereal.
[4164.47s -> 4172.74s]  How come their sign is gone? All right. Puke Peddler. Let's see if, uh, hold on a minute.
[4172.74s -> 4180.17s]  Are we really going to take the off-brand, uh, barf drinker here? What the hell is this? All right.
[4182.34s -> 4185.38s]  All right. I, I, I've gone over this person's sign like five times.
[4186.02s -> 4210.84s]  Hud for damage numbers. Put the HUD on for a little bit here in Cross-Region. All right. The,
[4210.84s -> 4217.48s]  hi. The reason why Cross-Region is not on is because if you're, if you got like a thousand
[4217.48s -> 4222.23s]  ping or something, then it's not going to work out for the tournament. I'm sorry. The way it is.
[4222.79s -> 4236.81s]  All right. VillaBalt versus, uh, Stinky. You guys can start whenever you feel comfortable. Good luck
[4236.81s -> 4242.57s]  to you. Uh, VillaBalt has, uh, he's like a merchant. He has all the items in the game
[4242.57s -> 4266.97s]  that, uh, he's probably going to block everything. Holy shit. Oh my God. This is going to be close.
[4272.74s -> 4293.32s]  Uh-oh. What is, what is he wearing on his back? Oh no. No. VillaBalt. That was so close. That
[4293.32s -> 4308.44s]  I went and put him down. Put VillaBalt down. That was actually pretty, that was cool. All right.
[4308.44s -> 4322.78s]  Where's Puke Peddler? All right. You've had a little, let's see what you got. Like I deserve
[4322.78s -> 4328.62s]  to lose. He was using an exploit. Oh, by the way, when we actually do this, we're going to
[4328.62s -> 4351.48s]  put rules in. So don't worry. This is not the Barf Drinker. This is the Puke Peddler. Oh my God.
[4351.48s -> 4362.01s]  So, yeah. Can we do a tag team? Um, it's going to be difficult. You do versus me and Josh. Yeah.
[4362.01s -> 4387.90s]  All right. Good luck. Puke Peddler. Let's see what you got. Oh, it's this move. This is the
[4387.90s -> 4400.06s]  biggest spell. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Stinky is a very skilled player because what I'm noticing
[4400.06s -> 4404.78s]  is a lot of, uh, a lot of consumables being used. Although Puke Peddler is coming up with
[4404.78s -> 4411.42s]  the lightning here. Doesn't look good for Stinky. Stinky's in a lot of trouble. Oh, that's it.
[4420.09s -> 4426.57s]  Puke Peddler. I've got to say that was a pretty good attempt to this pretty good display.
[4427.21s -> 4436.15s]  My only issue with you is a big issue is, uh, the Barf Drinker was the pacifist and used magic
[4436.15s -> 4442.36s]  tricks and, um, didn't like want to hurt anybody. And you just go right for the lightning move
[4454.65s -> 4460.84s]  and you're using his name. Oh, good job. I'm just kidding.
[4460.84s -> 4464.84s]  Everybody get out. Everybody get out. Quick. Leave. Run. Run. Run as fast as you can. Get out.
[4464.84s -> 4467.16s]  All dead four. Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave. Everybody all dead four. Quick.
[4467.88s -> 4471.80s]  All right. How do I do it? How do I all dead four? All dead four. I'm up.
[4496.31s -> 4507.18s]  It's like a fucking tornado coming in. It's like, it's like, did you see the tornado coming?
[4507.18s -> 4512.86s]  And it's like, whoa, look, there's a tornado coming. It's like a hundred miles away.
[4513.82s -> 4527.14s]  Whoa, it's here. The tornado's in front of the house. Okay. That was fucking crazy. I'm so scared.
[4527.14s -> 4545.08s]  That was so scary. I don't want my computer to crash. How do I all dead four? I don't know, man.
[4545.08s -> 4565.02s]  I'm fanicking. I don't need to back up my save. All right. So let's go back. What just happened?
[4565.02s -> 4575.74s]  Well, uh, that person that invaded may or may not have been, uh, somebody that didn't come in
[4575.74s -> 4583.03s]  and hack, uh, be a hacker. I don't know. It's so funny how everyone just like
[4583.75s -> 4604.97s]  scatters. Like everybody scatter quick. A tornado is here. Oh, that's so funny. It's like seeing
[4604.97s -> 4610.90s]  Slenderman, right? Like you're just like, oh my god, like two notes. That's cool. I got two notes.
[4611.46s -> 4614.18s]  And there he is. It's just like, wait, oh God, there's this thing here. I gotta get out.
[4626.12s -> 4644.36s]  Okay. Let's, uh, so we're gonna, um, okay. So the plan here is we have to get two invasion signs.
[4644.36s -> 4653.94s]  So, uh, Josh, be an invasion sign, please put your red sign down. I'll give you a new password.
[4653.94s -> 4663.27s]  I will check. Oh yeah. Let's go to the freezing lake. Wait, didn't I kill the boss? The freezing
[4663.27s -> 4681.88s]  lake. I think I killed the boss here. It doesn't matter if the boss is dead with the pet. Yeah.
[4681.88s -> 4693.03s]  But how come it wasn't working before? That's kind of weird. Stay where it works. My game is offline.
[4693.03s -> 4696.26s]  What? Hey, uh,
[4706.10s -> 4728.66s]  monkey ass. What are the 500 map markers? This game is huge. You didn't know. How did I know
[4728.66s -> 4734.71s]  was a hacker? Uh, last time we did this, uh, he came into the game and did like a bunch of
[4734.71s -> 4742.12s]  explosions and it was like exploding and scary. And I thought my computer was going to crash or
[4742.12s -> 4763.32s]  ran. All right. So, uh, let's make it a password to, uh, you, Josh. So let's see red signs and
[4763.32s -> 4781.35s]  gold signs, please. No, not Jesus. That was, that was a different person. What's a good,
[4781.35s -> 4808.34s]  let me think of a good password. I mean, that's an easy one, right? Yeah. So I want to see red
[4808.34s -> 4815.38s]  signs if you could, when you eventually have this as your password, which you'll get it in
[4815.38s -> 4834.33s]  just a moment. I'll change it. I'll update the screen to red. We need red and gold from chat.
[4834.33s -> 4846.22s]  Yeah. All right. So the password is I can see, uh, Josh's symbol. So I can do this.
[4846.22s -> 4857.19s]  Password is chair nine is the password. And you see red signs and gold signs. If you could,
[4857.19s -> 4899.61s]  that'd be fantastic. Chair nine. I need red and gold, please. Any red signs, any red signs.
[4899.61s -> 4912.87s]  I need the, you already have, oh, I need to do the tongue. Right. You can't summon two reds.
[4913.43s -> 4932.34s]  You can't. I thought you could. Oh, I have to do, I have to use the tongue first. Right.
[4932.34s -> 4950.42s]  Will I be able to see the signs on the ground or will this just let people invade?
[4950.42s -> 4959.74s]  Invasion timer is also literally zero. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. I mean,
[4959.74s -> 4971.69s]  I need to see some red signs. This one here, you peddler. Oh shit. We're literally being invaded
[4971.69s -> 4983.42s]  again. Oh, this is bad. Oh, this is bad. This is bad. I think this is bad. I think this is bad.
[4993.11s -> 5013.05s]  Why can't I see red anymore? So I'm going to gold. Okay. Well, this is, this is somebody else. This
[5013.05s -> 5044.86s]  is Zed. Okay. I think we're all right. Wait, what do you mean run? Okay. Who's someone in this guy?
[5044.86s -> 5066.74s]  All right. Zed. Why this is coming. That's my favorite part. All right. Follow me.
[5066.74s -> 5082.84s]  Host of fingers. Lasher the lame. All right. This is a double whip. All right. Back to the
[5082.84s -> 5096.26s]  fighting area. Please follow me to the fighting area. Good. Lasher the lame is over leveled.
[5096.26s -> 5099.14s]  That's why he has the thing next to his name. But yeah, but doesn't that mean he looks like
[5099.14s -> 5105.37s]  he's getting scaled down, right? It says down, right? How is he the host? Yeah. What does that
[5105.37s -> 5125.50s]  mean? It makes no sense. All right. Good luck. Let's see what you got. Lasher. Double, uh,
[5126.06s -> 5139.06s]  what are they supposed to say? Giant crusher? Zed versus Lasher the lame. Lasher the lame is not
[5139.06s -> 5174.17s]  flashing. Whoa. Actually was. What was I switched? That was a quick switch. Oh no.
[5175.62s -> 5182.73s]  Zed is going to take this one. Unless, uh, Lasher does something very, very interesting right now.
[5190.10s -> 5217.40s]  All right. Oh shit. This is, this is a good fight though. I'm enjoying this. Damn. Oh,
[5219.30s -> 5233.02s]  actually got him. Nice job. That was a really close one. Very close. Yeah. Why is Josh flashing?
[5233.02s -> 5243.43s]  Okay. So you are technically a, okay. You're technically a, um, gold, right? So I need to use
[5243.43s -> 5260.07s]  the thing and then bring in a red symbol. Camera work was better before. Do better. How come you
[5260.07s -> 5269.58s]  don't grow a mustache? I can't, dude. I can't have a mustache. It's not going to work. Okay.
[5270.22s -> 5279.19s]  So I need red signs. Put them down with that password. If you could please. I need to see
[5279.19s -> 5308.34s]  red signs. Any red signs? Do we have a confirmation from the bar of drinker, by the way? Is there one
[5308.34s -> 5314.94s]  right here? Did we actually get in touch with the bar of drinker? All right. Well, juggles,
[5314.94s -> 5344.73s]  juggles the great just came in. This would be interesting. Okay. Okay. Well, I'm just going
[5344.73s -> 5352.65s]  to say that I'm already very impressed. I'm incredibly impressed. So let's go ahead and
[5352.65s -> 5358.81s]  let's put some music on for this one because, uh, I think this is going to be a big one.
[5358.81s -> 5367.38s]  Don't fight yet, please. You're going to need some good old cartoon music if we could get it.
[5367.38s -> 5399.13s]  What was that cartoon music? I want like cartoon music, cartoon background music.
[5402.01s -> 5406.17s]  Why are they all like, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run. Why are they all
[5407.21s -> 5420.98s]  that? You know what I mean? That like run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run. Emotional cartoon music.
[5433.70s -> 5440.42s]  All right. We're going to do the how it's made theme song. Okay. Don't start yet. Do not start.
[5441.14s -> 5450.22s]  I want no HUD for this. I don't give a fuck if it looks stupid.
[5451.56s -> 5461.88s]  This was a, this is, this is a big deal. This one's a huge deal. All right. Who's who where's juggles.
[5461.88s -> 5501.26s]  All right, my god. All right, begin. Holy shit. Oh, he's got the he's got the silly hand
[5512.64s -> 5516.73s]  Oh
[5516.73s -> 5522.80s]  Shit. Hey, you guys won't go up on the rock. You guys won't go fight up on the two on the top of the rock
[5522.80s -> 5527.88s]  Will you you guys won't go fight on top of the rock? Will you why do they have the same items?
[5528.38s -> 5545.65s]  all the
[5555.66s -> 5574.25s]  Did he win I don't even know who's winning. Oh be careful careful
[5577.21s -> 5596.69s]  No, he's dead no juggles. Oh, I you know what put juggles down. I'm serious put both these guys down
[5597.01s -> 5606.40s]  That was a good one
[5606.40s -> 5613.82s]  The falling off. All right, we need a more red signs
[5613.98s -> 5620.62s]  We have confirmation by the way just to let everybody know just to make sure everyone's aware
[5621.89s -> 5630.61s]  We have confirmation that the barf drinker is not ready, but they will message when they are
[5636.49s -> 5648.14s]  Interesting the barf drinker. All right. I'm looking for red signs. Somebody has to take the lasher here if they could
[5648.26s -> 5654.87s]  This is pretty good display by the lasher. We need a red sign. So let's see some red signs, please
[5655.39s -> 5688.20s]  You home depot next the blasphemous barf drinker. All right, I think there's like 10,000 people
[5689.20s -> 5701.45s]  Invading at the same time. So we just got invaded by John Elden ring. Hey, what's up? John Elden ring is here
[5706.35s -> 5712.45s]  Lasher could you DM Josh with your steam name like your steam like ID profile and whatever
[5712.67s -> 5715.88s]  Just trying to keep track of everybody
[5715.88s -> 5721.45s]  Okay, so come on up to the rock, please. Welcome. That's the John Elden ring
[5721.57s -> 5740.42s]  You don't have to fight on the rock home depot music for this one. No, that's like annoying
[5740.62s -> 5759.66s]  How about just like Super Mario one? All right, where are you? You guys want to fight on the rock?
[5759.66s -> 5764.49s]  I mean that that's extra points if you can do it. That would be extra points. Oh
[5769.16s -> 5775.96s]  Creams going down extra points. Oh
[5777.04s -> 5817.10s]  Oh, what the heck? What the heck? It's not it's not the home depot. Am I my stream dying right now? You're at low FPS
[5817.10s -> 5820.74s]  I mean, it should be okay now
[5820.78s -> 5831.97s]  That was odd. All right. Yeah, everybody hang out. You're on a slideshow. There was a hiccup
[5831.97s -> 5839.77s]  I think hopefully brush your fingers that doesn't keep happening. All right
[5839.77s -> 5843.21s]  So what's it? What's like a good soundtrack for these two? You guys want to fight on the rock?
[5843.21s -> 5850.02s]  You can if you really want to fight up here you can I think we're okay
[5850.02s -> 5857.13s]  All right. Um, what's a good fine? I'll do the home depot theme. I'm only doing this one time
[5857.13s -> 5874.79s]  I'm not do this again. This is like a horrible thing to fight to. All right guys. Good luck. Oh
[5888.58s -> 5903.89s]  Good dodges up here. This is actually both of these guys a phenomenal job. This shows skill. This shows patience

[5952.28s -> 5966.20s]  Got him. Nice job. Wow
[5966.96s -> 5971.53s]  Nice job
[5971.53s -> 5974.66s]  I'm not kidding. That was impressive
[5976.05s -> 5982.91s]  Dodging around up here while you're fighting somebody and not falling off. Yep. Yeah
[5984.19s -> 5993.11s]  Well, hold on now. I want to see what you can do. Let's get let's get another gold sign in here John Elden ring
[5994.22s -> 6004.01s]  Very good job. I want to see what you can do. This feels like a classic video. I'm just I just think it's fun
[6004.93s -> 6012.71s]  It's just fun. I don't know. This is like I this is cool. I like this. I need gold signs now
[6012.71s -> 6042.18s]  Right. Do I have to refresh anything? Should I turn this off? Alright, cool any gold signs we refresh the area
[6042.26s -> 6046.75s]  This is fun. No, it is. It's I like doing stuff like this
[6046.75s -> 6047.75s]  I mean
[6047.75s -> 6055.48s]  We're kind of just sitting here watching people beat each other up and obviously I mean
[6055.48s -> 6061.07s]  I'm not gonna be able to get to all the people that want to participate but just fun to do
[6062.69s -> 6081.72s]  It's two invaders technically right or Josh. Are you gold? Turn the lowering thing off. Oh, you're red
[6081.72s -> 6092.70s]  Okay, so now I be able to see signs now, right or is because there's two invaders technically
[6092.70s -> 6111.33s]  I can't sign pull another one in I should be able to pull somebody in put on yakety sacks
[6111.69s -> 6124.47s]  Somebody needs to die turn the tongue back on
[6126.63s -> 6141.15s]  Hmm use a finger. I can't use remedy remedies. I can't it's great up
[6141.59s -> 6143.51s]  I think somebody has to die
[6143.51s -> 6157.08s]  John Elden Ring, I'm sorry, but I think we have to kill you and the tongue back on
[6157.56s -> 6160.38s]  Okay on this back on
[6160.62s -> 6165.64s]  Yeah. Oh, there we go. All right. We're good. No John. You're fine. Don't worry. You're good
[6166.16s -> 6171.45s]  Cory thinking about it. You've had a little we saw it. We've got you already
[6172.05s -> 6181.97s]  Zeke. All right, I might need to okay. I might I think I have to reload the area
[6182.17s -> 6190.58s]  I'm seeing the same like four or five names. I'm seeing the same like five names
[6190.66s -> 6200.52s]  We'll try Cory, but then I think I have to like reload the whole area as I keep seeing Zeke. I keep seeing
[6202.29s -> 6221.25s]  It'll about I keep seeing the same like three people. We'll do a reload after this like some boss music
[6221.29s -> 6224.30s]  What's a good? What's good boss music you think?
[6225.22s -> 6241.66s]  How about one hour of epic boss music walk? I feel like that pops people say dude block put block boss music
[6242.04s -> 6253.77s]  All right, sure Ross region East Coast. I don't think that's how it works
[6254.05s -> 6266.23s]  All right, you guys ready? Good luck to both of you. The music's gonna start in a second here. Go for it
[6266.59s -> 6294.40s]  Both of the same weapon mirror match. Holy shit. This is fucking this goes hard
[6294.96s -> 6315.68s]  nice
[6316.72s -> 6325.84s]  Imagine shooting the referee accidentally with an arrow good fight so far. Oh
[6341.37s -> 6345.64s]  Is that a stagger nice
[6346.36s -> 6358.09s]  That's a good fight. Good fight. Very good fight. All right, John Eldering you
[6358.49s -> 6376.24s]  I'm liking what I see so far. Who is this? I like what I see so far. All right, I have to do this twice
[6376.24s -> 6377.68s]  looking for gold signs
[6377.68s -> 6380.52s]  I'm gonna see if I can get one more person from here before I
[6381.16s -> 6399.84s]  End it up. We'll reload the area. What was that? It was an explosion, right?
[6399.84s -> 6403.72s]  But yeah, you know what? Maybe I could refresh it by doing cross region
[6403.72s -> 6419.64s]  I wonder what if that will do anything well that like look refresh everything actually might I'll try it
[6419.96s -> 6430.70s]  When you load in you have a pool of summons about 20 that fills up a resets when you reload the game
[6431.22s -> 6449.41s]  Really I have to reload the whole game. I'm picking from a pool of 20 people out of like
[6450.41s -> 6460.19s]  15,000 it's alright. It's what it's doing. This is fun. I'm gonna read we'll reload it
[6460.19s -> 6468.38s]  I will reload the game and I'll reload the area. So it's somebody said I have to reload the actual game
[6468.82s -> 6479.02s]  John Eldering, that was a great display. Thanks for playing. I got you written down. See if I can
[6479.42s -> 6480.58s]  Remove this
[6480.58s -> 6509.14s]  Made me I mean to reload the area. Okay. Well, that was weird. All right, I'm gonna reload the game
[6509.14s -> 6515.45s]  We'll get another pool of like a hundred people or something. Why can't I quit the game? Why am I stuck here?
[6515.45s -> 6543.06s]  Oh, what's happening right now? What's my even am I awake?
[6544.91s -> 6550.99s]  He just did the okay
[6552.75s -> 6559.46s]  Whoa, that just opened a bunch of stuff up. Is it the same people though? Oh, these are different people
[6559.94s -> 6572.38s]  These are these different people are these all different people I'm never gonna be able to get Josh
[6572.90s -> 6580.94s]  Well, I'm lagging. Why am I lagging so bad? I I'm gonna reload
[6582.52s -> 6588.70s]  I'm gonna do what that person said. They feel like that's my like actual game is lagging too, like hard lagging
[6589.90s -> 6605.58s]  Yeah, we'll do new password
[6605.62s -> 6638.38s]  How about alright so log back in? Okay, let's go use finger turn tongue on. All right
[6638.38s -> 6647.42s]  This should be this should work now use finger. Oh fuck. No, I need to
[6648.14s -> 6661.04s]  Goddamnit. Oh, I just so can't summon to brain. Well, I would write a summon. All right. Well looks like you're playing use finger
[6661.82s -> 6671.19s]  Fucking from software. I swear to god. It's like I need to like like be upside down drink milk
[6671.67s -> 6679.95s]  Pat my head blink ten times to play fucking multiplayer. All right, let's trans German
[6681.38s -> 6688.06s]  We're gonna bring in this person to fry finger, but whole I it's come on
[6688.14s -> 6707.66s]  I'm just trying to summon people were you in the game already boomer Andy. No boom from software is boomer Andy actually
[6709.01s -> 6715.94s]  Playing multiplayer with people with mechanics from like 1994 is boomer. That's boomer Andy
[6716.18s -> 6733.31s]  Wait, who's this? Who do I who's this?
[6737.42s -> 6748.68s]  Yes, I didn't I didn't summon this person. Uh
[6753.16s -> 6761.94s]  Well, I didn't even get Josh in here. No, no, no, don't just run away. Don't just run away. All right you two
[6762.42s -> 6765.34s]  France German and and
[6765.58s -> 6778.53s]  Wrangledorf go for it. You need to use the tongue very carefully. Okay, and because the tongue right? All right up to the rock
[6778.81s -> 6795.36s]  Wait, what what's going on? What happened? We can't even keep track of who these people are. All right me strong and
[6797.22s -> 6813.82s]  Wrangledorf go for it. I was gonna watch where do they go? What is going on? Oh my god. All right
[6813.82s -> 6837.79s]  I'm just fucking I'll be back. I can't even quit the game. I can't even set I have to go find me strong
[6838.13s -> 6847.13s]  I don't even know where they went. They literally just ran away. I
[6848.03s -> 6866.22s]  Don't know where you are. Okay, they all left. Well, how come I I can't I can't quit the game, huh?
[6866.54s -> 6873.45s]  What the fuck is going on?
[6873.45s -> 6916.28s]  Fucking please. No, I wanted you to kill me. Somebody kill me. Where's okay
[6916.28s -> 6938.76s]  We're gonna reload is this is fucked up turn off the tongue tongue is off. Okay, dude. There's a clown behind you
[6938.76s -> 6943.62s]  All right, let me get Josh back in here
[6943.62s -> 6951.93s]  We'll do this for a little while longer. I want to play that scary game too. Let me get Josh back in
[6951.93s -> 6967.30s]  I think if my games fucked up again. All right, I'm reloading one more time. Yeah new password. What's the scary game?
[6968.43s -> 6979.01s]  The what's it called something? It's like the coffee shop one. What day you guys do in the tournament?
[6979.01s -> 7001.43s]  I don't know if this might take a little longer than I thought closing shift. That's one. Yeah
[7001.43s -> 7010.26s]  I want to play closing shift. We do more of these fight clubs in the future. I love doing this
[7010.26s -> 7015.10s]  I just really wish there was a easier way to do this or how fun this is
[7015.14s -> 7024.62s]  I just wish it wasn't this much of like a panty ass. All right new password. You guys can't see right good
[7024.86s -> 7031.97s]  Okay, I got a password for Josh
[7032.65s -> 7046.33s]  private lobbies would be good too. Yeah, so the way it would work right is
[7047.79s -> 7055.42s]  I summon somebody and then somebody else so if I summon someone can someone else summon somebody else
[7055.58s -> 7071.76s]  What do I have to summon everybody Josh needs to be yellow for no invasions. You have to summon everyone. Okay
[7071.86s -> 7084.05s]  You just filtered by inscription. No, I didn't my plane closing shift today. Yes
[7085.62s -> 7099.41s]  Immediately after this front of the church door. Okay. All right, Josh is coming in the password
[7099.41s -> 7102.70s]  By the way is changing the password is now puke 30
[7102.90s -> 7111.24s]  No spaces no capitals summon me then summon a red then use the tongue for one more red
[7111.24s -> 7118.18s]  I think that's how it works. Yeah, so then the two reds will fight each other that makes sense
[7118.40s -> 7136.70s]  Yeah, this is PC. So now I need to see some red signs
[7141.08s -> 7148.55s]  Lowe some puke eater. Yeah, I I hopefully we can get confirmation that the barf drinker can participate
[7148.91s -> 7161.04s]  Okay, well we got invaded by by busting by me I think they're probably a participant I would assume
[7161.64s -> 7174.90s]  Now I gotta use the taunter's tongue. There we go. Okay, so
[7177.32s -> 7178.68s]  bonk you'lls
[7178.68s -> 7186.97s]  Let's do like I imagine just people are just invading. So can't summon red
[7186.97s -> 7197.67s]  I have to imagine if there's so many people just invading so here's the question then I got a really important question
[7198.07s -> 7202.17s]  If me and Ludwig were to do this, would we actually be able to do this?
[7202.87s -> 7204.87s]  Would we be able to actually summon people privately?
[7205.43s -> 7208.96s]  commander Hark
[7208.96s -> 7214.53s]  No
[7214.53s -> 7222.99s]  Kinda probably not you would need to have some you need to summon
[7222.99s -> 7229.10s]  Yeah, I would summon Ludwig as a cooperator like this and then summon an invader
[7229.40s -> 7236.89s]  But then we would need to summon another invader. He's called me a bandwagon normie. Well, what did I do?
[7237.21s -> 7241.31s]  Just don't leak the password
[7243.33s -> 7249.06s]  Secret passwords for all contestants. I think we lost somebody
[7249.42s -> 7258.61s]  God ended up without stream looking to know you started
[7258.61s -> 7265.12s]  I think we had the issue was trying to be able to reliably find participants. I think I have a few ideas
[7265.56s -> 7271.92s]  Maybe it's easier to just kind of pull people. I think what's gonna have to happen is oh
[7272.64s -> 7287.82s]  My god, did you see that person? That person was ridiculous looking. All right. Well, it looks like you two are fighting
[7287.98s -> 7298.08s]  Yeah, look by the way Ludwig is not doing what we're doing right now. It's just an idea that we thought would be fun
[7298.44s -> 7303.73s]  If it won't really work logistically then whatever we interesting to think about
[7303.73s -> 7315.68s]  All right, so come to the rock, please do not use tongue use gold for Ludwig then red and gold for combatants
[7316.08s -> 7322.74s]  But the issue is can I even do that because I I can't summon more than so when I summon Josh
[7323.22s -> 7327.87s]  Will I still be able to get to see gold and red on the ground?
[7327.87s -> 7336.22s]  Even if I summon another gold or another red that yes, okay. Okay. All right, that's confirmed. It's possible
[7336.22s -> 7339.08s]  All right, cool. All right, so let's go. So go to the rock
[7339.08s -> 7352.99s]  You guys ready to do I like the spear. I've got Quinn stinks and then busting in me
[7353.63s -> 7363.28s]  What what what weapon is that? I want to use that the weapons cool. What weapon art is that? Oh
[7364.32s -> 7375.16s]  Oh
[7375.16s -> 7378.44s]  Oh, he went for the triple poke went for the triple poke and it won
[7379.08s -> 7380.60s]  Good job
[7380.60s -> 7389.07s]  That was he that was amazing the tech chase
[7394.68s -> 7396.44s]  The tech chase
[7396.44s -> 7405.55s]  Caught every role nice job busting excellent work. So if we have private passwords, then we can okay, I get it
[7405.79s -> 7407.79s]  Yeah, all right, then we still we can do with fun
[7412.36s -> 7415.80s]  The issue is that there's just everybody knows that we're doing this right now
[7419.55s -> 7422.60s]  But people would know that during the stream day too, right?
[7424.48s -> 7433.76s]  We wouldn't we run into the same problem get away from it. All right amir versus uh,
[7434.32s -> 7438.70s]  We go busting bimmy. Let's do it. Just don't use the tongue
[7439.84s -> 7445.96s]  And only change location every time we might run into the same problem. We don't have to do a little bit of testing here
[7447.40s -> 7466.35s]  All right. Good luck guys
[7466.35s -> 7468.35s]  Lots of moving lots of movement
[7483.15s -> 7492.96s]  Flare I always do that. I was like go with the move. I'm always like
[7503.88s -> 7505.88s]  Very vulnerable, but still got out of it
[7510.72s -> 7523.20s]  Who won? Oh shit. That was close. Very nice job
[7523.68s -> 7531.20s]  You can play wobble dogs again. The reason why everything worked last time is because I used a group password
[7533.61s -> 7535.13s]  Aren't we doing that right now?
[7535.13s -> 7543.45s]  Can I change the group password to something pre-recorded on an undisclosed day? It would work without invasions
[7544.35s -> 7545.60s]  Huh?
[7545.60s -> 7550.91s]  And then broadcast it out
[7550.91s -> 7554.44s]  That might work. It does. Yeah, the group password doesn't do a
[7555.06s -> 7557.84s]  matchmaking
[7557.84s -> 7561.28s]  Three it would be an actual pre-recorded stream that would work
[7563.52s -> 7565.76s]  Yeah group password is only for I believe
[7566.81s -> 7568.81s]  What let me see. Well, you look cool. Hold on
[7569.05s -> 7583.13s]  You look really cool for dan and the bow armor. Very cool. All right, let's go for it
[7584.38s -> 7588.88s]  You too, and then after this I kind of want to just fight people
[7591.60s -> 7593.60s]  I'm I like I want to get in there. I mentioned to play
[7594.96s -> 7597.92s]  I'll do like five or ten times and then we'll do the scary game
[7607.90s -> 7618.52s]  Good luck. I definitely think I know at least one or two competitors from this stream
[7619.74s -> 7621.74s]  And the barf drinker, of course, obviously
[7628.36s -> 7630.75s]  What we might need to do
[7630.75s -> 7632.99s]  Is we might need to hold some of these offline
[7634.03s -> 7637.63s]  Not on stream. I think that would be interesting
[7638.57s -> 7642.73s]  Have like a night where whoever wants to participate we kind of just have a group password and just see if we can find some
[7642.73s -> 7643.77s]  people
[7643.77s -> 7649.31s]  Because doing it on stream is actually probably a lot harder
[7658.46s -> 7663.13s]  Yeah, i'll talk to ludwig about it. That was actually pretty plug pretty plug
[7663.93s -> 7666.33s]  Twin blade andy over here get a load of this guy
[7667.77s -> 7673.85s]  What's wrong with twin blade andy? Very good job. Very good job
[7677.16s -> 7678.20s]  All right
[7678.20s -> 7680.20s]  I it's time for me to get in the ring
[7683.71s -> 7688.11s]  Yeah, there's a there's a lot of people actively doing it. This is a good this is a good trial run though
[7689.18s -> 7691.98s]  Because I really do think that if we just have a group password in the discord
[7694.09s -> 7699.69s]  We can have some people kind of we can have people playing i can have maybe a couple of the mods or something if they're still playing
[7700.73s -> 7704.65s]  Keep an eye on it. See who's like doing well see who's like, you know playing against each other
[7705.13s -> 7707.13s]  Might be able to find it from from there
[7708.35s -> 7713.47s]  There's definitely at least one or two people that i'm pulling from this stream without a doubt. I gotta take a look
[7714.11s -> 7719.61s]  I'll talk to ludwig to see if he's uh, still interested
[7721.69s -> 7726.70s]  I'm putting together my pvp build right now. See we already got mods ready to go. All right
[7726.70s -> 7730.38s]  I'm putting some gear on and then i'm gonna fight and i'm gonna do some one-on-ones
[7732.86s -> 7735.50s]  I don't think I don't know if nancy drew is gonna make it. I'm sorry guys
[7736.30s -> 7738.30s]  It was funny, but I I don't know
[7738.86s -> 7747.63s]  What have I picked up linus?
[7747.63s -> 7752.92s]  Yeah, if you guys want to kill each other you can while I put some stuff on
[7759.71s -> 7776.30s]  What was I wearing before the royal armory? Okay, let me put on the bastards. Didn't they buff this?
[7777.02s -> 7784.01s]  Oh my goodness
[7784.01s -> 7786.81s]  That has some tag teams. I wish man. I wish
[7787.77s -> 7789.93s]  I wish they would I we could do so many things
[7790.49s -> 7793.98s]  Where the hell is the bastard stars?
[7793.98s -> 7806.14s]  Who the fuck is this thing?
[7806.14s -> 7814.62s]  Wrong hand and my staff. Okay
[7815.42s -> 7820.75s]  That's it. I haven't played in a while. It's been a while. All right. I'm ready to fight
[7823.23s -> 7824.99s]  Who wants to go you?
[7824.99s -> 7828.49s]  All right, mommy gonna go. Let's go
[7829.05s -> 7835.85s]  He basically wants the new wrestlemania on elden ring. I kind of do
[7840.56s -> 7843.12s]  Wait, I need to heal. It doesn't matter
[7843.93s -> 7848.65s]  What the fuck just happened dude? What the fuck was that?
[7849.53s -> 7852.03s]  That was 10 sec
[7854.97s -> 7870.27s]  Kill this thing
[7870.27s -> 7890.06s]  Am I lagging? I'm not even lagging though. I've crossed region on oh, that's right
[7890.62s -> 7894.14s]  All right. You want to heal up?
[7894.14s -> 7896.03s]  Nice fight
[7896.03s -> 7899.87s]  All right. Amir you want to heal up and uh go one v one and then josh i'll take you one v one, too
[7900.35s -> 7904.81s]  Oh, no, never mind. We can oh, you know, no josh. Why don't you one v one?
[7905.61s -> 7906.73s]  Uh, i'm here
[7906.73s -> 7912.89s]  That sounds good
[7912.89s -> 7917.74s]  Everybody say thank you to vr josh for being the um camera slash
[7918.38s -> 7919.34s]  uh
[7919.34s -> 7920.30s]  list
[7920.30s -> 7921.34s]  keeper
[7921.34s -> 7925.50s]  Really appreciate it. We'll pull a few people from this if we end up doing it
[7931.10s -> 7933.10s]  It's a good experiment. I think it's worth trying
[7933.18s -> 7960.35s]  All right. Good luck. What is josh using for a weapon? Nothing. He's gonna get killed by that
[7963.61s -> 7970.06s]  Nice try nice job. Are you gonna end the stream without the barf drinker barf drinker was uh unavailable today?
[7970.70s -> 7976.21s]  The barf drinker is uh was uh unavailable
[7976.83s -> 7981.05s]  Trust me when I say the barf drinker is team captain. So if we end up doing this
[7981.69s -> 7985.04s]  The barf drinker is the team captain no matter what it's just the way it is
[7989.00s -> 7991.00s]  And I would like to set up a stream
[7992.03s -> 7994.75s]  Where I I just follow the barf drinker around
[7995.39s -> 8000.22s]  Yeah, like just just follow the barf drinker and I go on an adventure with the barf drinker
[8002.06s -> 8004.06s]  All right. Let's go. You ready to go. Let's do it

[8896.37s -> 8901.57s]  Do you have any idea because i've been thinking about the barf drinker since we did that stream last time
[8904.03s -> 8909.63s]  I can't wait to play with this person. I actually am starstruck right now. I'm not kidding. I truly am heavy
[8909.63s -> 8918.98s]  I can't wait to do this
[8918.98s -> 8920.98s]  I'm so happy we actually tracked him down to
[8922.05s -> 8923.65s]  This guy I can't wait
[8923.65s -> 8926.37s]  This is gonna be so much fun
[8926.37s -> 8938.02s]  This whole stream leading up to this was worth it just for this one moment. Okay you guys

[9010.30s -> 9011.26s]  uh
[9011.26s -> 9018.03s]  What's this place called? The yil yil yil

[9142.61s -> 9145.09s]  No barf drinker. We're not going barf drinker. We're not going that way
[9148.42s -> 9152.77s]  I love how barf drinker just showed up and was like i'm doing that too. What do you want to do?
[9157.39s -> 9180.40s]  He's still warp skipping. What are you? Where is he gonna go? Is it not working?

[9999.65s -> 10012.90s]  Okay. All right. That was that was the one for cinema. Now. This is the one to win that was for cinema
[10015.14s -> 10020.50s]  Oh my god. I loved every second of that. The best part of that was the barf drinker doing like the perimeter
[10020.58s -> 10027.49s]  Just checking the perimeter juggles had no
[10028.37s -> 10033.46s]  blast and
[10033.46s -> 10043.26s]  Didn't get hit one time for like five straight minutes juggles carried the entire fight. Oh, man
[10043.34s -> 10049.55s]  I love that's so funny. The best part was definitely the arrow volleys. I just thought I couldn't fucking do it anymore
[10049.55s -> 10054.98s]  It was just too funny. All right, uh same password guys. Let's put the put these down

[10084.98s -> 10088.35s]  Trying to connect that after a while
[10088.35s -> 10092.51s]  It was just hard to kind of keep track and the invasions and tons of people trying to invade
[10093.86s -> 10100.45s]  It's a fun experiment. It's a fun idea, but I think we might need to do it
[10101.25s -> 10110.29s]  Offstream some too have people sign up through the discord. Yeah
[10111.01s -> 10113.01s]  It's probably a lot more of an undertaking than
