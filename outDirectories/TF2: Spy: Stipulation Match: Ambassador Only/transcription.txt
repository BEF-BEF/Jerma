[0.31s -> 13.89s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[13.89s -> 18.89s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Spy tonight with a stipulation match.
[18.89s -> 26.32s]  So if you do not remember what this is, I will give you a quick little memory jog, a brief description of what's going on here.
[26.32s -> 33.32s]  This is the series where I take a class, a certain set of items, or a certain rule set, and I have to follow the rules.
[33.32s -> 39.32s]  Like, for instance, in the last video was a shotgun heavy, and I was only allowed to use the shotgun, could not use the minigun.
[39.32s -> 46.50s]  And in this video, this is a Spy, like I said, and I'm only allowed to use the Ambassador and the Dead Ringer.
[46.50s -> 49.50s]  I cannot use the knife and I cannot disguise.
[49.50s -> 55.86s]  And before we get really started here, I want to say this setup surprised the hell out of me.
[55.86s -> 60.86s]  I really didn't think this was gonna go anywhere. I thought I was gonna just be dying and raging all over the place.
[60.86s -> 65.86s]  But no, I do really ridiculously well in this little set of clips here.
[65.86s -> 68.86s]  Especially in this first one, I killed like nine people in a row.
[68.86s -> 75.10s]  And really, after playing with this for maybe an hour or two, I think it took me maybe an hour to get this gameplay.
[75.10s -> 82.10s]  So after playing with this for a little while, I've come to the realization that I want to do this with the Connivorous Kunai.
[82.10s -> 85.34s]  Get a backstab on somebody and just go for the headshots.
[85.34s -> 90.52s]  I mean, who knows how well that's gonna work in practice, but it was just a thought I had.
[90.52s -> 91.52s]  I might try it at some point.
[91.52s -> 98.08s]  And also, guys, leave me a couple more comments. I love getting your ideas on the next stipulation matches.
[98.08s -> 104.08s]  The next one is probably gonna be a sniper with the Jurati and I can only no scope.
[104.08s -> 107.08s]  So that's probably gonna be the next one. But after that, I don't really have any plans.
[107.08s -> 110.08s]  So shoot me some comments. Let's get some more cool ideas going.
[110.08s -> 115.83s]  So let's talk about the gameplay now. We are on CP Gorge on defense.
[115.83s -> 119.83s]  And I would probably recommend you do this on defense if you're gonna try and do this.
[119.83s -> 124.83s]  Only because offense, you really have to push and there's a lot of spam factor you have to take into consideration.
[124.83s -> 128.83s]  But try it on defense. That's where I've seen the most success doing this.
[128.83s -> 135.63s]  Picking off that sniper right there and then me and this soldier get into one of the most ridiculous fights ever.
[135.63s -> 140.63s]  Like seriously, cue your favorite carnival music because that's what should be playing right now.
[140.63s -> 143.87s]  Like really, this is ridiculous. Look at this.
[143.87s -> 147.87s]  We are still going and eventually I get the kill on him. I couldn't believe that.
[147.87s -> 150.87s]  I was flabbergasted that I got that, by the way.
[150.87s -> 154.56s]  Coming out here, I'll get to strategy in a second, but watch what happens right here.
[154.56s -> 157.56s]  Demoman goes in the air. Do I get the? No, I don't.
[157.56s -> 160.56s]  Oh, well. Yeah, I do.
[160.56s -> 165.50s]  That guy was in the spawn door when I shot him.
[165.50s -> 168.81s]  I mean, it would have been so much better if I had got him in the air.
[168.81s -> 171.81s]  But, you know, whatever. At least I still got him.
[171.81s -> 174.43s]  Oh, also, I gotta bring this up.
[174.43s -> 177.43s]  So in the kill feed, you're probably seeing Henry Bubinski.
[178.43s -> 181.43s]  And that's just one of my stupid aliases I've been putting on lately.
[181.43s -> 183.43s]  That and Dick Simmons.
[183.43s -> 187.43s]  So if you see Henry Bubinski or Dick Simmons, it's just me being a weirdo.
[187.43s -> 189.43s]  I like to mess around sometimes.
[189.43s -> 194.80s]  Right there, also, I was trying to get the soldier to blow himself up on my dead ringer.
[194.80s -> 198.62s]  I don't know why it didn't work, though. Maybe I was a little too far away.
[198.62s -> 202.62s]  So now I want to talk about strategy, not just strategy with this setup.
[202.62s -> 207.62s]  I want to talk about the ambassador and how to improve your ambassador game.
[207.62s -> 211.62s]  This is how I do it, and it's a little weird. It's a little unorthodox.
[211.62s -> 214.62s]  But, you know, it might help somebody, so might as well tell you how I do it.
[214.62s -> 218.98s]  So what I do, I pretend the ambassador is a sniper rifle.
[218.98s -> 224.16s]  Not only do I do that, I also pretend that I'm zoomed in with the sniper rifle.
[224.16s -> 229.16s]  So if you can give yourself this mind trick where when you aim at somebody with the ambassador,
[229.16s -> 235.16s]  you're really telling yourself, hey, this is just a really crappy sniper rifle with, like, no zoom on it.
[235.16s -> 239.51s]  You'll start doing better, because, trust me, that's how I started using it.
[239.51s -> 241.51s]  And you have to remember, guys, it's all mental.
[241.51s -> 247.07s]  That crosshair, the ambassador crosshair, is no different than the sniper rifle crosshair.
[247.07s -> 251.07s]  It's all just mathematics. It's all mechanics in the game.
[251.07s -> 255.07s]  Because the ambassador and the sniper rifle, they're both hitscan weapons.
[255.07s -> 261.07s]  So if you just put yourself in the sniper mindset and shoot like you would a sniper,
[261.07s -> 264.07s]  you're going to use this item so much better, and you're going to be so much better with it.
[264.07s -> 269.31s]  And also, one more thing to add to this, do not freak out with this weapon.
[269.31s -> 272.31s]  Too many times I see ambassador spies just...
[272.31s -> 276.31s]  And they just freak out and shoot every single second they can.
[276.31s -> 283.49s]  And you have to realize, you have to wait a full almost two seconds before this is going to be able to headshot again.
[283.49s -> 285.73s]  So really take your time with this, guys.
[285.73s -> 291.73s]  Even if it takes you three or four seconds between shots, take that time to get yourself in the zone.
[291.73s -> 296.73s]  And don't just fire randomly, because this thing does less damage if you don't headshot someone.
[296.73s -> 299.29s]  So this is going to be the end of the gameplay, guys.
[299.29s -> 302.29s]  Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[302.29s -> 305.29s]  And I don't get on the top of the scoreboard or anything like that.
[305.29s -> 307.53s]  I wasn't really expecting to.
[307.53s -> 311.53s]  So I'll see you all soon, and take care, everybody.
