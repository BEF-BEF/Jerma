[29.62s -> 49.19s]  Hey, what's up? Yeah, um, uh, yeah, why are you acting like I delayed the stream two days ago?
[50.01s -> 57.91s]  Delayed it again yesterday and then came in today and reverse delayed back to today.
[58.63s -> 76.57s]  I think I didn't do that. This is outrageous. Yeah, I figured. All right, so I got some stuff done
[76.57s -> 83.10s]  that I wanted to get done. And I did say, wait, well, maybe we'll do an Omega gaming weekend.
[85.13s -> 92.01s]  No, no, let's just go now. I'm ready to hang out now for a little bit. Sometimes I, you know,
[92.01s -> 99.77s]  you just get the urge. You want to go. So that's exactly what we're going to do. Welcome back.
[99.77s -> 108.28s]  We're going to play Xbox games, original Xbox. The plan is still on Saturday to play Elden Ring
[108.28s -> 119.13s]  with Ster. So that's still the plan. You smell what you don't have. You have no idea what I
[119.13s -> 139.02s]  smell like. You have no idea. It's called old piss. Anyways, you need to change your pin tweet.
[139.02s -> 143.58s]  I don't think it's ever going to happen. You know what? I, my pin tweet will change once.
[144.38s -> 152.36s]  Uh, honestly, probably when grotto beasts is like ready and here and ready to go,
[152.36s -> 162.58s]  that will be the pin tweet very soon. A lot of things in 2023 that I just, they're very exciting
[162.58s -> 169.05s]  and I don't know how to tell you them, but I've seen a lot of copiums.
[169.93s -> 180.09s]  Uh, just wait, just wait. It's, I, I'm not talking. I'm not saying anything.
[184.28s -> 187.56s]  I'm not going to say anything. All I'm telling you is that grotto beasts is imminent,
[188.28s -> 192.84s]  very imminent to a point that I think a lot of people might not understand. I think a lot of
[192.84s -> 197.16s]  people like, Oh yeah, he keeps saying it. Oh, it'd be a few months. It'll be a few months.
[198.90s -> 209.80s]  Grotto piece is imminent, imminent, but I want to give you a real date when I have it, but it's
[210.44s -> 216.97s]  imminent. No, I didn't just learn that word today. I've said imminent a few months ago when I talked
[216.97s -> 229.64s]  about this as well. I didn't just find that word out. I know words guys. I know words.
[231.46s -> 236.74s]  I have at least a higher functioning caveman intelligence. I know words. I have a vocabulary.
[243.90s -> 251.22s]  Media, imminent. Oh, what, what? That word, imminent media, imminent.
[251.94s -> 269.56s]  Ooh, I say that word now too. You should play dark and darker. I'm, I'm going to,
[270.28s -> 278.44s]  I just have to find the opportunity when I want to do that. Cause that game has gone into alpha
[278.44s -> 282.04s]  for like a weekend, come out of the alpha weekend, go back into an alpha weekend. Right.
[282.84s -> 287.88s]  When it's in beta, when the game, when I can just play the game whenever I want,
[287.88s -> 293.72s]  that's when I'll do it. I, is it a closed beta? I really do not have been really paying that much
[293.72s -> 302.65s]  attention. I will be honest. Why do you hate the last of us? I've never played the last of us.
[302.65s -> 308.17s]  No, that's a lie. I believe I'm in a long time. So let me see if my memory can piece together.
[309.21s -> 319.29s]  I think I did the PlayStation now stream feature connected to a friend and like played the game
[319.29s -> 327.59s]  through their game. Am I making that up? It's been a while. And I think I played like the first 40
[327.59s -> 334.47s]  minutes that way. PlayStation had this feature where you could like stream the game to somebody
[334.47s -> 345.67s]  and they could take control of it. It was very weird, very weird system. Read this, read this,
[345.67s -> 358.01s]  read this relax. Will you relax? It's share play. Yeah. So yeah. Okay. So I got like a,
[358.01s -> 364.17s]  I got like a fucking 1500 bit rate share play version of the first 40 minutes of the last of
[364.17s -> 371.74s]  us. I don't know. I just didn't play it. I didn't play it. So what? Oh, well, I didn't play God of
[371.74s -> 379.61s]  War either. Well, I played the first hour of that. It's phenomenal by the way. That's the worst way
[379.61s -> 391.32s]  you could have played it. Yeah. But what, who cares? But hope you're doing well. What a fake fan.
[391.32s -> 395.08s]  I had never told you I was a fan of the last of us. When have I ever talked about that?
[395.80s -> 401.90s]  Has there been a stream where I've sat here and gone, oh, last of us. Let me just, let me just
[401.90s -> 405.34s]  tell you all about it. Oh, I could take, I could talk for hours about last of us. That's never
[405.34s -> 418.20s]  happened. Hurry up. You relax, settle down. You, I, you did. I remember it. That was actually kind
[418.20s -> 424.76s]  of funny. That actually would be really funny. If somebody has like a clip from like a few years
[424.76s -> 432.28s]  ago or something of me being like, Oh my God, it's so good. I just never played it. That's funny.
[433.40s -> 438.62s]  I will accept that if that, if that's the case. But anyways, yeah, we're gonna play more Xbox.
[438.62s -> 443.58s]  We're going to start kind of right where we left off with Obi-Wan. We're not going to play Obi-Wan,
[443.58s -> 452.74s]  but the one that's coming up in the list was the DaVinci code. DaVinci code. Are you guys ready?
[452.74s -> 458.76s]  Are you ready to play a little bit of Xbox? And then again, next time I'll see you after this,
[459.48s -> 466.92s]  the weekend stir randomizer Elden Ring co-op stream is still happening on Saturday and Sunday.
[467.80s -> 471.48s]  Well, Saturday. And then if we, you know, we're giving ourselves the option to do it Sunday as
[471.48s -> 479.83s]  well. Cause what if we're just not having any fun at all? That's the plan. And let's go. I think
[479.83s -> 492.82s]  we're ready to get rolling here. Just make sure this is plugged in correctly. Let's see. Can you
[492.82s -> 508.12s]  see it? By the way, haven't seen this movie either. I've never seen this movie. I've never, I've never,
[508.12s -> 518.20s]  it's a book, right? Is it a book or a movie? I don't know. This is the DaVinci code video game
[518.20s -> 527.86s]  based on the movie, based on the book. Okay. All right. I'm ready. You guys ready? The DaVinci code.
[530.23s -> 546.30s]  Whoa. New game. Okay. I would like to create a save game. Anybody played this? Is this any good?
[549.11s -> 555.35s]  Tom Hanks is in this. I, I, okay. Here's the only way that I would say I think Tom Hanks is in this
[555.35s -> 563.05s]  game. It's stuff like, Oh, what are you talking about? Huh? We have to get over there. And it's
[563.05s -> 569.82s]  just stuff from the movie that they just kind of sentence mix together, right? There's option one.
[569.82s -> 576.04s]  Option two is it's an impersonator. So I, I don't think this is, if it's Tom Hanks, actually like
[576.04s -> 582.68s]  Tom Hanks as, um, DaVinci detective, whatever he was, I would be surprised if it wasn't just like
[582.68s -> 588.17s]  sentence kind of mixing from stuff he set up previously on the movie. Let's find out. Let's
[588.17s -> 638.26s]  go. Start game. Let's go. That's not Tom Hanks. Kind of reminds me of Bale. Paris by my lecture
[638.34s -> 643.06s]  at the American university and followed by an unexpected invitation. That's Tom Hanks.
[643.06s -> 653.98s]  Professor Langdon, thank you for coming. I am captain Bezoufash. Do you know this man?
[653.98s -> 659.66s]  Chauxinier, a curator of the Louvre. I was supposed to meet him tonight after my speech.
[660.22s -> 669.54s]  Is it? Follow me. It kind of sounds like him. Is that actually? No, but it's from the movie.
[669.62s -> 698.87s]  Yes. But it's not original dialogue. It's from the movie. That's a huge, heavy ass painting.
[702.52s -> 717.50s]  You should not have run. Now tell me please. I beg you. Is it? All right. All right.
[730.39s -> 731.59s]  This is like shot.
[731.59s -> 764.86s]  What? So it's so intense. Where did he shoot him? All right. What kind of game even is this?
[765.74s -> 770.86s]  So this should be of no surprise. Feel free to examine the body, Mr. Langdon.
[770.86s -> 776.49s]  It's like a detective game. Search the body for clues relating to his death.
[776.49s -> 784.98s]  Why is this in a window like this? This is in a window inside of a window. What did that say?
[787.58s -> 791.98s]  What the hell is going on here? All right. The position of his feet reinforces the reference
[791.98s -> 798.47s]  to the Pinnacle and the sacred feminine. Replication. Repeating a symbol is the
[798.47s -> 804.07s]  simplest way to strengthen its meaning. Chauxinier positioned himself in the shape of a five-pointed
[804.07s -> 814.26s]  star. That's not Tom Hanks. That's not Tom Hanks. Interesting analysis. That sounds like Ross from
[814.34s -> 822.63s]  Friends. Is it? It's a Pinnacle. One of the oldest symbols on earth.
[822.63s -> 828.47s]  Used over 4,000 years before Christ. Devil worship. It's an actor. No. The Pinnacle is
[828.47s -> 833.59s]  a pre-Christian symbol that relates to nature worship. The ancients envisioned their world in
[833.59s -> 842.15s]  two halves. Masculine and feminine. It's the ancient alien's narrator? What? Oh my god.
[842.15s -> 846.15s]  What? Ancient aliens?
[857.48s -> 862.84s]  Wow. Okay. So yeah. Yep. All right. We saw that. What is this?
[868.52s -> 869.96s]  That's a great Tom Hanks.
[877.91s -> 911.83s]  Wait. It's a marker. It's not blood?
[916.18s -> 930.38s]  As you know. You know, as you know, us detectives, we do these things.
[930.94s -> 937.78s]  What does this mean? That, monsieur, is precisely the question you are here to answer.
[938.66s -> 945.14s]  Part of it looks like a numeric cipher. Yes, our cryptographers are already working on it.
[946.18s -> 951.54s]  What is this game? These numbers may be the key to who killed him. This is like a CSI game, but it's
[952.98s -> 956.58s]  Tom Hanks and it's the movie. Does this happen in the movie?
[956.66s -> 962.02s]  An accusation against his murder makes sense, I suppose. Sonnier was a Frenchman. He lived in
[962.02s -> 971.70s]  Paris. This happens in the movie just like this. I have seen a lot of death in my work and let me
[971.70s -> 976.74s]  tell you something. When a man is murdered by another man, I do not believe his final
[976.74s -> 983.62s]  thoughts are to write an obscure spiritual statement that no one will understand. I believe
[983.62s -> 990.42s]  he is thinking of one thing only. La vengeance. I believe Sonnier wrote this note to tell us
[992.73s -> 997.77s]  Oh, but that makes no sense whatsoever. You told me Sonnier was attacked by someone
[997.77s -> 1002.49s]  he had apparently invited in. Considering the circumstances, I would assume that if
[1002.49s -> 1006.41s]  Sonnier wanted to tell you who killed him, he would have written down somebody's name.
[1006.65s -> 1008.73s]  Precisement, précisement.
[1010.97s -> 1011.77s]  One moment please.
[1014.57s -> 1016.97s]  No, I'm not skipping it.
[1019.70s -> 1025.06s]  Unacceptable. I made it very clear. Captain, please excuse the interruption, but
[1027.62s -> 1029.30s]  I have deciphered the numeric code.
[1029.94s -> 1034.18s]  We already got the code deciphered. Hey, Resident Sleepers, we already got the code
[1034.18s -> 1038.34s]  deciphered. It took us 15 seconds in the cutscene. The US Embassy asked that you phone in as soon as
[1038.34s -> 1042.74s]  possible. While I explained the code to Captain Fash, you need to make this call.
[1044.63s -> 1050.74s]  Thank you. Where can I find a phone? This line is secure. You may use it.
[1054.54s -> 1058.78s]  What that actually means is that phone is bugged. It's the most bugged phone we've ever had.
[1064.71s -> 1068.15s]  I'm sorry, Miss Nouveau. I think you may have given me the wrong.
[1068.15s -> 1072.63s]  No, that is the right number. It's the three digit code on the paper I gave you.
[1073.35s -> 1076.79s]  What? The embassy has an automated message. It kind of looks like he's like,
[1078.31s -> 1083.86s]  it looks like it's a little too tight. Okay, so examine an item. I should look at that.
[1085.67s -> 1095.75s]  Select the item. Okay. What does it want me to do? Is that it is some kind of.
[1095.75s -> 1098.07s]  Well, I missed everything. This isn't important.
[1100.15s -> 1107.18s]  Examine the item. In his final hours of life. Oh, shit. Okay. Clues.
[1107.82s -> 1115.35s]  Okay. What game is this? No, we're not skipping. You got, we have to follow the rules.
[1125.91s -> 1133.74s]  Ooh. Who do I, who do I, I wasn't looking. Who do I talk to? Is it you?
[1138.09s -> 1141.05s]  Who is that? Who's captain? Who's the, what is, where's the captain?
[1141.69s -> 1154.09s]  I don't think this is relevant. Who's the captain? Wait, I need a phone number to call.
[1154.09s -> 1166.71s]  What? There's only like two people in the room. That's what, dude, I can't talk to either of these
[1166.71s -> 1176.65s]  people. So you mean to tell me that in his final hours of life. Dark souls music. I certainly hope
[1176.65s -> 1191.75s]  you have. Oh, look at that. Okay. Use the phone to call the three digit number.
[1191.83s -> 1199.45s]  A progression sum of the two preceding towers. What was it? Never heard of it.
[1201.42s -> 1206.70s]  Mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci created the succession of numbers in the 13th century.
[1206.70s -> 1211.18s]  Obviously there can be no coincidence that all of the numbers Sonia wrote on the floor belonged
[1211.18s -> 1224.22s]  to Fibonacci. Stop talking. This isn't working. Three digit four, five, four. I was going to say
[1224.30s -> 1230.62s]  that nobody has a three digit phone number. What is it? Like fucking 1400. I know that's a family
[1230.62s -> 1235.98s]  guy joke. That's a family guy joke. I know. Oh, what is this? Is this three? Yeah. I, I, look,
[1235.98s -> 1240.47s]  I get it. I know everyone's going to spam that in a second, but a three digit telephone number,
[1243.80s -> 1252.46s]  four, five, four. This isn't what I'm looking for. What is he saying? What does this mean?
[1257.66s -> 1259.50s]  There's not a fucking phone number. I'm pissed.
[1271.26s -> 1287.27s]  I got a minus two that says be original. The person that made this comment is the real
[1287.27s -> 1296.86s]  Peter Griffin is their name. That's the name of the chatter. You love that show. You should
[1296.86s -> 1305.32s]  have been happy about that. The restrooms are at the end of the grand gallery.
[1305.32s -> 1313.30s]  You should have been very happy. I had to go to the bathroom.
[1320.10s -> 1326.66s]  I'd like a little bit of privacy. No more than 45 minutes. At that point, it's a little too weird.
[1326.66s -> 1331.05s]  Do you agree? I agree. I think that is correct.
[1344.01s -> 1347.93s]  Hey, hit the fucking hand thing. The fan.
[1350.89s -> 1352.41s]  Hit the hand dryer so nobody hears us.
[1366.10s -> 1369.30s]  Weird. It was stuck out of your neck. I don't know how you did not notice.
[1374.68s -> 1379.16s]  In case you decide to run. In fact, they hope you do run because it would make their case much
[1379.16s -> 1384.36s]  stronger. Why would I run? I'm innocent. Do you recall the three lines of text that Sonia
[1384.36s -> 1389.32s]  wrote on the floor? What you saw was not the entire message. This is a photo of the complete
[1389.32s -> 1396.86s]  message. Why would Sonia write this? Was he trying to frame me? No, he wrote it for me. The number of
[1396.86s -> 1402.54s]  code is meaningless. Sonia wrote it to make sure the investigation included cryptography, ensuring
[1402.54s -> 1407.42s]  that I would know as soon as possible what had happened to him. Why you specifically? How do
[1407.42s -> 1411.74s]  you know it wasn't for some other cryptographer? P.S. is the nickname he called me when I lived
[1411.74s -> 1416.78s]  with him. All of a sudden, we're just going to hear a flush from the stall. It's like,
[1420.54s -> 1425.82s]  he was my grandfather. Where's Langdon? Still in the man's room, sir. We are seeing small movements,
[1425.82s -> 1432.38s]  so the GPS dot is obviously still on him. Perhaps he feels ill. If he had found the
[1432.38s -> 1439.19s]  dot, he would have removed it and tried to run. Hm, fine. Start screaming for no reason.
[1439.19s -> 1444.63s]  Fash will be taking you into custody any minute. You gotta just, just breathe in and out of each
[1444.63s -> 1450.31s]  other. We need to act now. You want me to run? It's the smartest thing you could do. If you stay,
[1450.31s -> 1454.31s]  you will spend weeks in a French jail. But if you get to your embassy, then your government
[1454.31s -> 1458.79s]  can protect you while I prove you had nothing to do with this murder. Forget it. You need to
[1458.79s -> 1463.19s]  tell Fash that the message on the floor was for you and that my name is not there as an accusation.
[1463.83s -> 1469.99s]  Fash is convinced you are guilty. The only way to get you out is with a distraction. The GPS tracking
[1469.99s -> 1475.19s]  dot? We need them to think you are running. If we can throw it out the window onto one of the cows
[1475.19s -> 1478.63s]  going by, I bet a lot of the police would clear out. Wait, throw it out? Wouldn't that be moving
[1478.63s -> 1483.35s]  really fast all of a sudden? See if you can find something to attach it to that would make it
[1483.35s -> 1493.26s]  heavier. Like, oh wow, we picked up, um, Tom Hanks is now going 70 miles per hour right now.
[1494.06s -> 1499.26s]  And in weird, it looks like he was going like 100, 200 miles per hour out of a window,
[1499.82s -> 1516.02s]  like really fast, losing elevation quickly and then drove very fast. I hope he's okay. Okay,
[1516.02s -> 1524.31s]  so I have to find something that's going to weigh this down. I'm not leaving yet. No,
[1524.87s -> 1542.60s]  I need to weigh it down. Is it like an examine button? There's a sneak button too. All right,
[1542.60s -> 1552.30s]  cool. You can pick up items like the soap. I can use this soap that will work.
[1552.94s -> 1563.93s]  Come help me open this window. Open to every stall. Oh, he's trying. He's trying to get away.
[1563.93s -> 1569.93s]  He's trying to, he's trying to sneak out the window. Where's Langdon? Stealing the men's room.
[1569.93s -> 1593.90s]  I knew it. He is trying to escape. Go down the toilet. Hurry Robert. Hurry Robert.
[1594.38s -> 1631.66s]  Hey, it was like minus 15 last night. It was frozen. Combine items. Hold on. They heard the
[1631.66s -> 1657.59s]  wit. What? Hold on a second. These are the dumbest detectives I've ever seen. There's no way. If
[1657.59s -> 1663.35s]  you're going to open up all of them, he's going to get a call on his phone at the last one.
[1664.46s -> 1686.94s]  Oh wait, you have a new location? Of course. Of course. You pre-watched. No, that's just
[1686.94s -> 1696.22s]  welcome to every single. We're trying to hide from someone. Wait, we're here. We're literally
[1696.22s -> 1707.02s]  in the place.
[1707.74s -> 1738.23s]  Oh, lame saint. Wait, what am I doing? What do I have to do? It's a puzzle. Do all Lang sign?
[1742.47s -> 1795.46s]  Uh, how about uh, let, let, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, let home. Let, let him not let him cook.
[1798.39s -> 1810.42s]  I might. Oh, you have it in emote only. I see what you're doing. This game takes around five
[1810.42s -> 1816.42s]  hours to complete. Two of them are cutscenes. Are you serious? Okay. Um, I think what about a hint?
[1816.42s -> 1821.46s]  An anagram is when the letters of a word or words are mixed up to form other words.
[1824.28s -> 1830.84s]  Uh, captain, I think I see a couple of people here. They look like the perpetrators.
[1831.72s -> 1836.84s]  No, no, it's definitely the way all the rats hang out in the alley where the ping is going off.
[1837.78s -> 1851.59s]  Uh, okay. I guess I will just go back to what I was doing. It's going to be like the, the,
[1855.29s -> 1867.64s]  the, the, the song, the same, the same, the same time they were killed at the same time.
[1868.28s -> 1904.17s]  I don't, I have no idea. I've ran out of hints. The, this all the main, like the main main street,
[1904.81s -> 1922.63s]  the main sale, the main, the main lasso. I don't think that's correct. Oh, lame saint. Wait,
[1922.63s -> 1927.59s]  what do you mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What? That was correct. Do you think that was right?
[1927.59s -> 1944.04s]  How do I check it? The main, did I actually have it? Main lasso. I had it right. I'm pretty good
[1944.04s -> 1957.21s]  at this then. Is that it? No, that's not. It's the main something then the main,
[1957.77s -> 1966.50s]  wait, it is the main something. Stop posting a delicious meal. Like I've seen it a few times
[1966.50s -> 1970.90s]  and it's making me hungry and I don't want to see it anymore. It's delicious, nutritious,
[1970.90s -> 1979.32s]  and it isn't weird. It's not a strange thing to eat sometimes. Okay. The, oh, sorry. I had a bunch
[1979.32s -> 1983.24s]  of vegetables, like a ton of like really good for you, like high in a bunch of different vitamins.
[1983.56s -> 1987.64s]  Incredibly good for you. Good for your brain and shit. Oh no, I ate food that's really good
[1987.64s -> 2008.39s]  for your brain. I don't know how to do this. All right. It's the, the, the, the ale, old,
[2009.35s -> 2025.03s]  the old, the slow, oh, lame saint. Is this in the movie? Did they figure this out in the movie
[2025.03s -> 2033.00s]  really early on? Does Tom Hanks go, oh, lame saint, the main silo, right? Does this actually
[2033.00s -> 2043.50s]  happen in the movie? Is the answer in the movie? Is it really? It's in the movie. All right. Give
[2043.50s -> 2060.01s]  me five more minutes and I'll get it. The, the most, the lost, wait a minute, the lost, the lost,
[2065.90s -> 2094.74s]  the loser. Maybe it's not the, how, the, how she should, give me the first, give me the first
[2094.74s -> 2099.22s]  letter. Give me the first letter. This is, I look, I'm sorry. I don't, I don't, these are cool for
[2099.22s -> 2105.27s]  like a Sunday newspaper. I, give me the first letter. Just give me the first letter and I,
[2105.91s -> 2109.99s]  give me the first letter or I'm not moving on. I'll sit here all day. Give me the first letter.
[2116.46s -> 2126.52s]  T. All right. So I had it right. It's definitely the, not like this. All right. The, so the what?
[2126.52s -> 2151.86s]  The, the late, the most, the most, the most, the nice, the, the what? All right. What's,
[2151.86s -> 2164.15s]  all right. Second word, first letter, second word, first letter, second word, first letter.
[2166.78s -> 2184.92s]  No, no, no, no. The moon? The question mark. Hold on. The, the salt. I see a lot of salt
[2184.92s -> 2190.42s]  shakers. The salt. No nuts. What? What's, why can I do two A's? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Go back.
[2190.42s -> 2202.12s]  How do I go back? What just happened? Oh, there are two ways. The salt. Okay. The, there's no T.
[2202.68s -> 2216.52s]  The salt, sugar, the spice, the spicy, the spice, the sugar, the ice cream, the malted,
[2217.56s -> 2239.61s]  the sugary, the M, the main silo, the main lasso, the main, did I have it right? The main, the main
[2240.25s -> 2262.82s]  lasso, the main solo, the main solo, the main losa, the main as also, the main also, the main also,
[2265.43s -> 2301.72s]  the main also. The, the, the mom, the mom. Why are you spamming Bob Ross? Why are you spamming
[2301.72s -> 2324.20s]  Bob Ross? The Bob, the painter. The, the mist. No, the mist. Bob Ross. Painting? Painting. Education.
[2325.42s -> 2369.22s]  Follow along video series. Paint. Bob Ross. What does that mean though? Give me the next letter.
[2369.22s -> 2390.63s]  I was just staring at the chat with like my mouth open. The mole, the main, the ma, ah, the ma,
[2391.91s -> 2403.14s]  mo, me, mom. You're an expert at charades. You got this. Bob Ross. Picture. Bob Ross. Snap, snap.
[2404.07s -> 2413.54s]  Paint. Picture. Picture. Picture. Painting. Picture. It's not, that's not what it is.
[2413.54s -> 2417.22s]  That can't be what it is. That can't be. No, no, no, no, no, no. That can't be what it is.
[2417.78s -> 2420.18s]  No, that can't be what it is. The shit that's on the fucking cover of the box.
[2421.27s -> 2425.83s]  I did not know. I did not know that's what this game was about. I didn't know. I, I didn't know.
[2425.83s -> 2430.31s]  I didn't know what it was. I thought it was Mona. I, that's the shit. That's literally the front.
[2430.31s -> 2437.40s]  That's on the box. The Mona Lisa's on the cover. But like I, and it burnt into the screen. I was
[2437.40s -> 2444.60s]  on it for so long. All right, relax. I didn't. I've never seen the movie.
[2447.96s -> 2459.56s]  This screen burning is so bad. I was on that for so long. That was painful. I didn't think
[2459.56s -> 2469.40s]  it was going to be. Dude, give me a break. I did not know what this movie was about.
[2469.96s -> 2477.16s]  Lena Da Vinci. I didn't think they were going to give us spoilers in the first five minutes.
[2478.20s -> 2485.96s]  No, we don't know how long the grand gallery will stay empty. You have to go now.
[2485.96s -> 2498.31s]  I will see you at the embassy, Ms. Yolanda. That's that person that, okay. Wait, new character.
[2502.07s -> 2517.32s]  Okay. So what's the objective? Find a UV light. Isn't that, isn't that in the case over here?
[2522.12s -> 2533.11s]  The main, the main, what was it? The main lasso. I forgot this whole game was about a painting.
[2533.91s -> 2540.47s]  Look, I know. Listen to me. I did, I forgot this. I'd never seen this movie. I haven't thought of
[2540.47s -> 2547.03s]  the Da Vinci code in, I don't know, at least, at least fucking 10 years. I don't know. I never
[2547.03s -> 2552.46s]  even care where the movie came out. I forgot like Da Vinci made the Mona Lisa and the whole thing
[2552.46s -> 2557.74s]  is about like stealing the Mona Lisa because there's a secret in it. I don't know. I don't
[2557.74s -> 2574.46s]  know what it was. I just looked at the cover. I need a UV light. You didn't know the Mona Lisa,
[2574.46s -> 2579.66s]  what? You didn't know the Mona Lisa was painted by Da Vinci. No, but I didn't, I guess I just
[2579.66s -> 2585.74s]  didn't realize like that this movie in this game. Well, I don't, I don't know. I was just kind of,
[2585.74s -> 2594.47s]  I was lost there for a second. I didn't, I know Da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa, but in my brain,
[2594.47s -> 2598.47s]  they weren't going to start with that. Like the Mona Lisa was going to be like the big reveal at
[2598.47s -> 2604.55s]  the end of the game. Not the first puzzle. You know what I mean? I, but I didn't, you're an iPad
[2604.55s -> 2611.42s]  kid. I can't defend it. I can't defend it. I, I take the L. I can't defend it. This is the first
[2611.42s -> 2616.06s]  thing they do in the movie is they go over that. I didn't see the movie. Guys, I don't even, I didn't
[2616.06s -> 2628.42s]  care. For a second, I was blending two movies together. What's the one where Nick Cage? It's
[2628.42s -> 2633.54s]  like American treasures or something. It's like he, and he's like the constitution or what they
[2633.54s -> 2644.60s]  both are the same movie. All right. Sneak. I don't know, dude. It's like this relic that has all these
[2644.60s -> 2648.60s]  secrets in it. It's like the constitution had a bunch of secrets in it. The Mona Lisa has a bunch
[2648.60s -> 2656.23s]  of secrets in it. Like Leonardo Da Vinci was a like an alien and he landed and taught everybody
[2656.23s -> 2665.72s]  fucking technology, whatever the hell it is. I don't know. Oh, I thought there was a person
[2665.72s -> 2687.53s]  behind a desk. I was like, why can't they not see me? What are you? What's happening?
[2691.51s -> 2696.31s]  Why is it fighting right now? Holy shit. Stop, stop, fight, fight.
[2716.58s -> 2721.70s]  That was an extraordinary reaction. I did not, I did not fucking think that was going to happen.
[2724.20s -> 2728.84s]  Knocked on the floor and then they just punched me in the face over and over again.
[2731.67s -> 2738.73s]  I didn't even know there was a combat in this game. What the hell was that?
[2743.56s -> 2753.53s]  Dude, knock, knock. Who's that? You wouldn't even like, oh, who is that? Let me, I can't even
[2753.53s -> 2767.78s]  identify myself first. That was, I would have, that was fucking crazy. If the officer sees me,
[2767.78s -> 2777.82s]  he will not let me pass. I must sneak by him. Okay. This game just, you all wanted me to skip.
[2778.46s -> 2789.54s]  We have melee combat in this game. It was one of the most ridiculous things I think I've ever
[2789.54s -> 2806.04s]  seen in a game. Like what was the point of any of that? So far, so good. Items you can use be on
[2806.04s -> 2817.06s]  the lookout. Okay. Can I just like take everything? Like you can pick up weapons. What do you mean?
[2817.62s -> 2840.04s]  Where's a weapon? You need to initiate a throw during a throw. Okay. Why is this a wrestling
[2840.04s -> 2845.64s]  game now? This is like turning into like Arkham. Defend begins when the enemy gets the upper hand
[2845.64s -> 2861.75s]  counter the attack. When you start an attack, buttons appear at the bottom. Okay. Okay.
[2862.31s -> 2880.89s]  Leave him alone. What? I can and will defend myself.
[2882.49s -> 2889.18s]  Get off him. What? Stop. It's not fair. Why do I have to do a QTE every time I want to fight?
[2889.18s -> 2893.53s]  Give me the weapon. Where's the weapon? There's supposed to be a weapon here somewhere. Where is
[2893.53s -> 2921.42s]  it? Oh, shit. Get me the fuck out of here. Is there, how do I get a weapon? Where is this weapon that
[2921.42s -> 2934.50s]  apparently exists? Do not make me help you. You keep walking past it. Guys, it looks like somebody
[2934.50s -> 2944.44s]  threw up on my monitor. I can't see anything. Where do you see? Oh, shit. Where is it?
[2952.62s -> 2969.77s]  What do you see? Is it on the ground? It's on the floor. Actually, guys, this shit burnt into the
[2969.77s -> 2995.64s]  screen. It's hard for me to see what's going on. What was that? What's with the weird? Okay. All
[2995.64s -> 3001.88s]  right. This time don't aggro everybody. Get the weapon. It says get the whip on and equip it.
[3001.88s -> 3007.64s]  It wasn't in French. It was just text on the screen. If the officer sees me, he will not let
[3007.64s -> 3031.08s]  me pass. I must sneak by him. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Very nice. Keep going. Keep sneaking.
[3032.44s -> 3036.60s]  Be looking for items you can use as weapons. Be on the lookout for items you can use as weapons.
[3036.60s -> 3049.45s]  I don't see anything I can use as a weapon. Have to knock out that officer to get to the evidence
[3049.85s -> 3065.16s]  count. No, I don't want to see this whole fucking tutorial again. Oh, my God. Okay. All right. I
[3065.16s -> 3086.62s]  think I see it on the ground. Yep. Okay. Let's go. How do I pick it up? How do I pick this thing up
[3086.62s -> 3106.15s]  off the ground? Oh, my goodness. How do I? This should be useful. Okay. This could be useful to
[3106.15s -> 3151.13s]  Knox. This just won't end. Would you really hit a lady? Get out of here. This thing sucks.
[3152.33s -> 3172.86s]  Have you had enough? Oh, my God, dude. I hit him in the face. Everybody relax. Oh,
[3175.91s -> 3191.75s]  what? This fight is going on way too long, man. I will use force if necessary. We have been.
[3192.55s -> 3210.33s]  I hope he will be all right. This looks useful. Wait, drag his body? To where? Why would I want
[3210.33s -> 3222.58s]  to drag him anywhere? There's nowhere I can put him. All right. Let's go. I got a weapon.
[3223.64s -> 3231.88s]  And now I need to look at the evidence area, right? Examine, please. I'd like to examine
[3231.88s -> 3250.23s]  that evidence. Hey, not working. Maybe I can't have a weapon in my hand. What are you doing?
[3250.23s -> 3257.38s]  Get out of there. I cannot satiate my bloodlust. Wait, why did I drop it?
[3270.04s -> 3281.75s]  That's so unfair. Can I just go into the evidence cabinet now, please? Nope. You can't be in
[3281.75s -> 3290.57s]  anything. Oh, shit. All right. I'm going to beat the shit out of these guys now. I am pissed off.
[3290.57s -> 3323.27s]  I am done. I am pissed off. I'm ready to. This is it. I thought I heard something.
[3328.84s -> 3392.31s]  Are they both right here? How do I knock? Got it. First try. First try. There you are. Robert,
[3392.31s -> 3397.11s]  I told you to get out of here. If I. Where were you? I had to get the black light. If my
[3397.11s -> 3400.87s]  grandfather left me a message. I can't believe I fucked with that. I thought I told you to leave.
[3400.87s -> 3405.27s]  Why did Senor write my name on the floor? Oh, my God. I'm never going to live that down.
[3406.47s -> 3410.63s]  The letters PS may mean Princess Sophie, but do they mean anything else to you?
[3411.51s -> 3417.43s]  Anything at all? Yes. I saw the initials PS once when I was very young. Sophie,
[3418.15s -> 3421.91s]  this one hasn't been out in over 10 years. The initials appeared with a symbol,
[3422.55s -> 3427.59s]  a fleur-de-lis. How could you possibly know that? I'm fairly certain your grandfather was a member
[3427.59s -> 3432.63s]  of a secret society. The fleur-de-lis combined with the initials PS, that is the Brotherhood's
[3432.63s -> 3438.79s]  official coat of arms. They call themselves the Priory of Scion. The Priory's membership has
[3438.79s -> 3445.27s]  included some of history's most cultured individuals. Men like Botticelli, Sir Isaac
[3445.27s -> 3454.74s]  Newton, Victor Hugo, and more importantly, Leonardo da Vinci. The identities of living
[3454.74s -> 3460.90s]  My jaw hurts. That was like snapping. But the PS and fleur-de-lis that you saw as a child
[3460.90s -> 3465.94s]  would make sense if tonight were Priory related. There is a lot we need to discuss,
[3465.94s -> 3468.58s]  but I cannot afford to let them capture you, Robert.
[3468.58s -> 3473.14s]  Sonier obviously brought us together for a reason. I'm staying until we figure this out.
[3475.08s -> 3480.76s]  Fine, then help me. My grandfather wanted us to see this painting for a reason.
[3480.76s -> 3486.28s]  There must be a message hidden here. It smells like alcohol. Where have I smelled that before?
[3488.36s -> 3496.49s]  I thought he was implying that I was like drunk. No, not it. What is this?
[3497.13s -> 3508.41s]  Pfft. Why can I see this? What do you see? Random symbols in my face. You see random symbols?
[3508.41s -> 3511.05s]  Yes, yes, lots of them. This one looks like a P. This one looks like an E.
[3517.67s -> 3523.13s]  Nice phlegm. Okay, it's going to be like of...
[3541.11s -> 3547.83s]  They obviously are not random symbols. They're arranged. Yes, it does. This is somebody...
[3551.08s -> 3560.38s]  Okay, so now what am I supposed to do about this? How do I solve this? Do I have to like highlight
[3560.38s -> 3568.78s]  ones that match or something? Do I have to highlight the whole thing? All right,
[3568.78s -> 3574.01s]  maybe I have to just light up everything. Like just highlight it. Highlighting, highlighting,
[3574.57s -> 3585.38s]  highlighting. Highlighting every word. Highlighting every word. Oh shit.
[3615.02s -> 3621.10s]  Guys, I've done my fair share of the back of the Cocoa Puffs box. You don't think I know
[3621.18s -> 3626.54s]  how to do this flawlessly? Do you know how many Captain Crunch boxes I've been through in my day?
[3638.54s -> 3674.66s]  E. B? We? That's definitely E's. That's definitely a P. I'm gonna say we. We was A, right? There's
[3674.66s -> 3691.99s]  gonna be a lot of As. This could be A. That could be A. This is probably A. One, two, three, four,
[3692.15s -> 3706.04s]  five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, A, B, C, D, E. That's F.
[3715.43s -> 3721.27s]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. What did it mean? It's like he wrote this
[3721.27s -> 3734.17s]  when they were like bashing the door down to come get him. What's the code though? What's
[3734.17s -> 3745.18s]  the Da Vinci code? I'm gonna solve it right now. Well, I was wondering if you had anything specific
[3745.18s -> 3751.22s]  to tell me about this encrypted message. As you can see, this symbol is the most common one.
[3751.86s -> 3763.00s]  As a result, I believe it is the letter E. That's what I said. Wait, what's? It's this one. This is E.
[3764.63s -> 3769.11s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Anything come up more than 10 times?
[3769.83s -> 3776.25s]  That's what I was saying. I had the formula, right? We just gotta find where A is, right?
[3777.05s -> 3784.97s]  How am I supposed to? How would you ever do this? Okay, this is E. This is maybe like of
[3786.12s -> 3821.98s]  or like two of. This is probably T. Whoa, the, that, that, that, these, that, and, the, the, what?
[3822.86s -> 3839.86s]  Painting, painted, I, there's something painted those, the, those, these are probably those.
[3840.50s -> 3885.46s]  I've painted those that lies, lies and lies painted those that be tween, between, between
[3885.46s -> 3901.32s]  those that knew, knew between. This is wrong. It's not D. Maybe it is. Do. Wait, what? Oh,
[3901.80s -> 3908.36s]  it's Da Vinci. Miss Da Vinci. I'm thinking like, I don't know. It's just relax. Relax, relax, relax.
[3908.36s -> 3915.56s]  Da Vinci painted those that knew. All right. Listen, I'm reading it like the painted to
[3915.56s -> 3923.50s]  something like the. Oh my God. What's wrong with my brain today? I must be tired or something. I am
[3923.58s -> 3937.11s]  probably tired. Da Vinci painted those that knew between Bacchus, Bacchus,
[3940.31s -> 3958.28s]  between Bacchus and lies the clue. But what's this? You Da Vinci painted those that knew between
[3958.28s -> 3981.80s]  Bacchus and you're, you're Yu-Gi-Oh. Oh, I got it. Hey, you want to look behind the painting.
[3984.46s -> 3992.38s]  Nice. Bacchus is the God of wine and Uriel is an angel. If I'm not mistaken, there is a painting
[3992.38s -> 3996.78s]  of Bacchus. He forgot it was the Da Vinci game again. I keep forgetting Madonna of the rocks,
[3996.78s -> 4002.54s]  which should be in there too. Let's go. I keep forgetting. This is a Da Vinci game. Wait,
[4003.10s -> 4008.94s]  Robert is innocent. He did not murder Sonia. Asian Navoo. Innocent or not. I have direct orders to
[4008.94s -> 4013.74s]  arrest Robert Langdon on site. I'm sorry, but I can't go to jail until I helped Sophie find
[4013.74s -> 4023.82s]  the real murderer. You are working together. Robert, look out. What the? It would be best if
[4023.82s -> 4044.55s]  you would let me go. Ow. Was it this much fighting in the movie? All right. Take him.
[4044.55s -> 4055.38s]  You take him. Told me boxing wouldn't be useful in a teaching career. Where do we put him? Who
[4055.38s -> 4067.27s]  cares? All right. We got what we needed. Oh my God. Now, now let's go. Search the Bacchus,
[4068.23s -> 4113.05s]  Uriel and John. Where the hell is this painting? It's actually, it's pretty dark. I can't really
[4113.05s -> 4121.26s]  see. That means you guys can't see. I need to turn this up. I need to make this a little brighter.
[4121.26s -> 4137.43s]  Hold on. Give me one sec. It's dark. How many of this helps? Does that make this better or worse?
[4137.51s -> 4143.67s]  Actually, kind of worse. And the game's just supposed to be like this. Yeah, the game's
[4143.67s -> 4157.62s]  just supposed to be like this. Okay, so where is this painting? I gotta find like three things.
[4158.26s -> 4176.73s]  Oh, wait a minute. Saturn's sphere. And okay, so I have one of the planets. I have no idea which
[4176.73s -> 4180.09s]  one of these is the right painting considering that they're all so hard to even decipher what
[4180.09s -> 4199.61s]  they are. Is it just not even in this room? Oh, I thought it wanted me to do it in here.
[4199.61s -> 4205.86s]  Well, I don't see anything special. Everyone seems to be pointing at something now. Bacchus
[4205.86s -> 4210.82s]  points to the right and Uriel points to the left. In between them we have John the Baptist and he's
[4210.82s -> 4269.38s]  pointing up. What does that mean? There's something up there. What? On the painting above John the
[4269.38s -> 4285.80s]  Baptist. Give me a boost. Maybe I can reach it. I was seeing if she was gonna fall. Back in the day
[4285.80s -> 4311.13s]  when they were just QTEs for no reason. Zero. You gotta make it harder than that.
[4317.32s -> 4324.22s]  I thought one of the paintings is ringing. It's like wait, inside the painting is like a painting
[4324.22s -> 4332.07s]  of a phone but it's a real phone. Hello. That would have been fucking cool. Imagine like one
[4332.07s -> 4335.83s]  of these there was a phone and you could reach it and it was actually it was a real phone.
[4337.08s -> 4344.92s]  Why would you not do that? And it was like embedded in the paint and it was flush with the paint and
[4344.92s -> 4348.68s]  painting. So it was just like what the fuck am I looking at? Hey, wait a minute. You reach it and
[4348.68s -> 4358.87s]  it's like a phone. I would be so much better at this. Where somebody's office was ringing.
[4359.51s -> 4374.66s]  Where's this person's office? I wasn't even looking. Like an office telephone is ringing
[4374.66s -> 4382.47s]  and it was like oh look it's this way but I wasn't even I wasn't even looking. Down here?
[4383.19s -> 4391.70s]  You didn't pay any attention? No, zero. Like absolutely just as close to zero as you can get.
[4393.27s -> 4393.67s]  Down here?
[4437.56s -> 4471.18s]  What? This is my grandfather's office. Maybe we can find a clue here.
[4474.23s -> 4476.07s]  I'm just standing here.
[4486.76s -> 4493.59s]  Wait what? That's you talking here but you're standing here. How could you be in there and out
[4493.59s -> 4503.61s]  here? Wait that's not her talking?
[4509.37s -> 4516.92s]  I thought that was I thought she left a message and that's how they found out that
[4517.48s -> 4528.28s]  I got the bug. How high are you? I'm not. Just relax. I'm not. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine right
[4528.28s -> 4544.07s]  now. I'm not high. I haven't had any marijuana cigarettes in like at all. I'm not. I'm kidding
[4544.07s -> 4548.07s]  around. It might be another clue to Sonier's involvement with the Priory of Scion
[4548.07s -> 4554.95s]  or perhaps the Priory's involvement with the Louvre. Okay so let's take a look. Take a look
[4554.95s -> 4562.18s]  at this. It's research on where all the Fleurs de Lis are in the Louvre. It might be another clue
[4562.18s -> 4567.06s]  to Sonier's involvement with the Priory of Scion or perhaps the Priory's involvement with the Louvre.
[4569.54s -> 4580.97s]  Interesting. Okay. Nothing else. Take a look at this. Okay. What about what's on the
[4580.97s -> 4588.57s]  computer? A special laptop used by police for crime scene investigation. Okay. Oh wait a minute.
[4588.57s -> 4594.04s]  This night has been moved recently. The dust has disturbed around the edges. I think grandfather
[4594.04s -> 4605.70s]  moved it so the lance would point us towards something. So excited. This map of the Louvre.
[4606.42s -> 4613.74s]  It smells. It smells like alcohol. It smells. Map of the Louvre. This map of the Louvre.
[4614.38s -> 4625.72s]  It smells like alcohol. Okay. But it. So what? There's a phone on the map.
[4626.52s -> 4641.30s]  This map of the Louvre. This map has been drinking. Okay. But so boring as fuck just like the book.
[4643.67s -> 4667.03s]  Come on. What do you mean all these trues? True, true, true. It's a novel.
[4667.83s -> 4681.30s]  Boring as fuck. Book sucks. It's probably good, isn't it? All right. So what's a good book?
[4682.02s -> 4691.05s]  What's a good book? Can chat agree on some nominees for what a good book is? Okay. Well,
[4691.05s -> 4704.94s]  I don't know what else to do here. It smells like alcohol. Search the office. I did. Can we get some
[4704.94s -> 4718.46s]  Apollo up here? Okay. I see the Bible, Green Eggs and Ham, Dante's Inferno, and Dune. All right.
[4718.46s -> 4725.83s]  Pick between those four. What? What? What? What's your favorite book? What's your favorite? Well,
[4725.83s -> 4732.22s]  not with the Bible. Put the Bible in there. No, those three. Those returning the Bible.
[4735.82s -> 4756.57s]  Large bookshelf containing many books. It's probably like a right. No event seems to connect
[4756.57s -> 4769.38s]  to the adjacent room. Can we get up there? How do we get up there? This map of the Louvre.
[4770.82s -> 4776.62s]  How do we get up to the vent? Can we move a chair? Do I need a ladder? Bring a ladder back in here?
[4777.59s -> 4781.19s]  How much of a point and click adventure game does this game want to be versus how much is
[4781.19s -> 4785.99s]  it actually? Right? Like, do I need to go get a ladder and bring it back into this room?
[4803.29s -> 4812.26s]  UV light. Okay. All right. All right. So, so it's, it's okay. So it's a, I just didn't know. I didn't
[4812.26s -> 4814.74s]  know if it was like a go to your inventory. Like point and click. Okay. What's this?
[4815.38s -> 4826.78s]  What do we need to know? Okay. Wait. He circled his office. No, look closer. It is the room next
[4826.78s -> 4832.54s]  door. The restoration room. There is a vent up above. If you boost me up to it, maybe I can get
[4832.54s -> 4838.70s]  to the other side. Oh, wait. Yeah. We're doing a poll. What was the poll again? It was, what's your
[4838.70s -> 4858.38s]  favorite book? What's a book that you consider to read? I have to tap every time. What were the
[4858.38s -> 4866.94s]  options? Um, uh, green eggs and ham. Do you need to search around some more? Dune. Maybe we can find
[4866.94s -> 4883.22s]  a clue here. The Bible and what was the other one? I said there was a fourth one. What was it? Oh,
[4883.22s -> 4887.70s]  Dante's Inferno. Yeah. Okay. There you go. What do you, do you like any of those? Chemistry isn't
[4887.70s -> 4897.58s]  my strong suit. Me neither. What do you think this table is used for? Oh God. I can't even read this.
[4897.58s -> 4905.91s]  There must be instructions for this somewhere. I'm making a, we just just chug it.
[4907.34s -> 4918.76s]  Lactose. Okay. Well, I don't know. We'll figure that out. What's this?
[4920.66s -> 4930.84s]  Best book of all time. What do we got? Green eggs and ham. Dude, it's so funny how Dune is the lowest
[4930.84s -> 4949.99s]  of all of these. So green eggs and ham is just absolutely sweeping right now. Okay. The Bible
[4949.99s -> 4959.05s]  is in second. Best book of all time. Green eggs and ham more, more important than the Bible.
[4960.92s -> 4968.09s]  Bible way more important than Dune. Also Bible more important than Dante's Inferno. Two religious
[4968.09s -> 4973.77s]  books up here. Well, one of them is a religious book. The other one is a take on the religious
[4973.77s -> 4983.06s]  text, right? How is Dante's Inferno not higher? Those books are terrible. Dante's Inferno. I
[4983.06s -> 4989.34s]  remember, I remember reading Dante's Inferno and just being like, what's going on here?
[4990.54s -> 5001.26s]  What the fuck? How many of you guys just haven't even read Dante's Inferno? Green eggs and ham.
[5001.26s -> 5017.59s]  Okay. All right. Dante's Inferno. What was it? Dante's Inferno is a... I haven't read any of these.
[5017.59s -> 5028.10s]  What? You've never read green eggs and ham? You had to have. You've never read green eggs.
[5028.10s -> 5038.73s]  I think this might be the only one of the four that a lot of you have read. That's the one I know.
[5038.73s -> 5046.57s]  Can I get a towel? All right. We are way over, over our time limit on this one.
[5046.57s -> 5050.82s]  I did, this was very fun, but I'm going to do one or two more puzzles and then I'm moving on.
[5050.82s -> 5063.29s]  I cannot make out what the painting is supposed to depict. Maybe we can remove the dirt.
[5063.85s -> 5078.50s]  Finish it. Dirty painting with the towel. I cannot make out what the painting is supposed to depict.
[5078.50s -> 5088.06s]  Maybe we can remove the dirt. Use the, use it. Rinse it in the sink. I don't actually have to do
[5088.06s -> 5103.77s]  that, do I? Anything else in here? This one's cool. I like this one. I like this one. Box is empty.
[5104.33s -> 5114.49s]  There's nothing out of the ordinary about these books. What book? Nothing there. What's your
[5114.49s -> 5125.34s]  favorite? What's your favorite book? What's your favorite Xbox game of all time? I never had one.
[5126.38s -> 5134.06s]  I've never had an Xbox before. Original. New game, please. I will. Let me just get past this.
[5139.02s -> 5142.70s]  Enzyme that functions in the defense against fungal and insect pathogens.
[5143.26s -> 5148.20s]  Commonly used as a counter enzyme that neutralizes supercharged oxygen molecules.
[5151.18s -> 5155.98s]  It neutralizes supercharged oxygen molecules called superoxide radicals.
[5155.98s -> 5161.48s]  You don't want those on your counter. I mean, pretty good cleaning.
[5162.81s -> 5169.61s]  Involved in the hydrolysis of lactose to constitute galactose and glucose.
[5170.41s -> 5175.53s]  Its functions include catalyzing the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen.
[5176.17s -> 5183.21s]  An enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia.
[5183.21s -> 5186.92s]  I'm just going to pick two until I get it right.
[5187.64s -> 5232.38s]  A speaker of enzyme should clean the painting. I cannot make out what the painting is.
[5233.26s -> 5235.58s]  Toilet sounds. It kind of was toilet sounds.
[5236.22s -> 5240.95s]  It seems to be working, but I think we need to spread the enzymes around.
[5241.91s -> 5252.10s]  You ruined it! That was a weird look.
[5254.38s -> 5257.45s]  What is that?
[5258.17s -> 5262.09s]  The winged victory of Samothrace. That's here in the Louvre.
[5262.09s -> 5264.41s]  But why would Sarnier want us to go there?
[5264.41s -> 5266.01s]  How many books have you read in the last year?
[5266.73s -> 5273.56s]  This is actually interesting. Yeah, right. Yeah, right.
[5275.19s -> 5282.22s]  10 plus books in the last year. Yeah, right. I could believe between zero and five.
[5283.30s -> 5289.27s]  10, 10 plus. Some of you mean that. Some of you are talking about like 20.
[5291.18s -> 5294.57s]  My goal is always 100. 10 is easy.
[5295.29s -> 5298.01s]  Some people read a lot. That's a lot.
[5298.01s -> 5301.53s]  How many books are you reading? 10? More than 10 books a year?
[5304.84s -> 5309.90s]  Yeah, those are 10 Dr. Seuss books.
[5309.90s -> 5315.96s]  All right. 32% say zero. 30% say between one and two.
[5315.96s -> 5319.34s]  Wow, we have to read more, don't we?
[5319.34s -> 5323.82s]  A majority of people in this chat right now, I'm included in this.
[5324.82s -> 5330.41s]  62% of us, at least out of the sample size that I chose to answer,
[5330.41s -> 5338.94s]  have only read under two books in the whole year. Sometimes less than one.
[5338.94s -> 5343.67s]  The last time I've read a book was Game of Thrones.
[5343.67s -> 5352.18s]  It was the Game of Thrones book. It has to be the last Game of Thrones book.
[5352.18s -> 5363.29s]  What about audiobooks? I think those count.
[5363.29s -> 5368.06s]  It's the only book you've read. Name 10 books.
[5371.58s -> 5373.53s]  That's not fair, though.
[5373.53s -> 5379.67s]  That's actually not fair because I don't pay attention to that world really at all.
[5379.67s -> 5384.58s]  Name 10 books. Dr. Seuss.
[5384.58s -> 5397.26s]  Rain, Eggs, and Ham. The Great Gatsby.
[5397.26s -> 5420.36s]  Um, The Shining. The Catcher in the Rye.
[5420.36s -> 5422.12s]  The Twilight series.
[5426.57s -> 5437.08s]  Okay, Twilight. I don't want to look at chat. I don't want any help.
[5437.08s -> 5440.12s]  A Song of Ice and Fire. Book one.
[5440.12s -> 5443.54s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. How about this?
[5443.54s -> 5446.01s]  Book five. A Dance of Dragons.
[5446.01s -> 5467.43s]  Okay, that's five. That's six.
[5467.43s -> 5476.10s]  Tempest. Let me do it. Let me do it.
[5476.10s -> 5478.78s]  Let me do it. He's thinking so.
[5478.78s -> 5481.42s]  I was thinking of a relevant book that I may have even read or heard of.
[5483.64s -> 5494.58s]  The Tempest. Um, I mean, everything is a book.
[5494.58s -> 5497.83s]  I could just name anything. Lord of the Rings.
[5497.83s -> 5502.09s]  I mean, The Hobbit. Lord of the Rings.
[5502.09s -> 5514.79s]  And that's like 15. What do you mean not a book?
[5514.79s -> 5517.75s]  Eight? That's four. That's not four.
[5517.75s -> 5529.22s]  That's not four. Uh, you know what?
[5529.22s -> 5534.17s]  I'm just going to name a random movie.
[5534.17s -> 5538.38s]  And my Big Fat Greek Wedding. Is that a book?
[5538.38s -> 5541.66s]  That's a book, right? That's a book, right?
[5541.98s -> 5547.61s]  That's a book. Was that a book first?
[5547.61s -> 5552.12s]  Like, I kind of feel like it was. Is it not?
[5552.12s -> 5559.21s]  I'm thinking of like, okay, movies that like were books.
[5559.21s -> 5567.10s]  Dune. Titanic. A screenplay is not a book.
[5567.10s -> 5570.28s]  Technically, it was.
[5570.28s -> 5572.81s]  James and the Giant Peach. How's that?
[5572.81s -> 5576.87s]  That's been at least 10.
[5576.87s -> 5585.34s]  The Titanic. No, somebody said that in chat
[5585.34s -> 5587.50s]  and I said it out loud. I didn't say that.
[5587.50s -> 5590.87s]  I was laughing. No, the Titanic.
[5590.87s -> 5592.95s]  Okay, I need to defend myself here.
[5592.95s -> 5595.03s]  Somebody said the Titanic. Like, 10 of you said it.
[5595.03s -> 5596.71s]  And I was reading the chat room.
[5596.71s -> 5598.71s]  Going, the Titanic? Like, what the fuck?
[5598.71s -> 5602.55s]  The Titanic was not a book first.
[5602.55s -> 5605.35s]  Oh my god. You guys are, you guys are, I'm being, I'm,
[5605.35s -> 5607.35s]  you guys are, you guys are attacking me.
[5607.35s -> 5613.80s]  Play the game? How many of you guys actually care
[5613.80s -> 5615.16s]  about me playing the game? I thought it was like,
[5615.16s -> 5617.16s]  don't play the game, play the other one.
[5619.75s -> 5622.79s]  You cannot honestly believe that I thought the Titanic
[5622.79s -> 5626.07s]  was a book before it was a horrific thing
[5626.07s -> 5627.19s]  that happened in the world.
[5627.19s -> 5628.87s]  You can and will defend myself.
[5628.87s -> 5629.43s]  What's going on?
[5630.15s -> 5641.02s]  This isn't necessary.
[5641.90s -> 5645.99s]  The book is actually what was based on the,
[5645.99s -> 5647.27s]  okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on.
[5647.27s -> 5647.99s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5647.99s -> 5649.99s]  We need to make sure that we get this clear here.
[5650.89s -> 5655.72s]  The movie, The Titanic was, was it based off of a book
[5655.72s -> 5657.08s]  of the telling of that story?
[5657.08s -> 5658.28s]  Move them out of sight.
[5658.28s -> 5666.84s]  So they just made that up.
[5666.84s -> 5668.84s]  Okay, I just, I'm just, we're just checking.
[5668.84s -> 5678.92s]  It could be the movie that's, this isn't important.
[5678.92s -> 5679.80s]  A lot of you know what I mean.
[5680.60s -> 5683.48s]  Like, Titanic, the movie, was it like a retelling
[5683.48s -> 5685.24s]  of like a book version of the Titanic
[5685.24s -> 5686.44s]  where those characters were in it?
[5687.00s -> 5692.89s]  I don't think this is relevant.
[5695.88s -> 5697.32s]  It's historical fiction.
[5698.04s -> 5698.68s]  That's what I'm saying.
[5698.68s -> 5700.36s]  Was there like a Titanic book?
[5704.07s -> 5705.51s]  All right, I'm playing a different game.
[5706.15s -> 5717.82s]  I think that great wedding.
[5717.82s -> 5718.22s]  I don't know.
[5718.22s -> 5720.70s]  I figured like maybe that's a, maybe it was a book.
[5720.70s -> 5724.70s]  No, the Titanic is a real thing.
[5724.70s -> 5725.58s]  Oh my God.
[5725.58s -> 5726.46s]  How do I get out of this?
[5727.02s -> 5727.74s]  How do I get out of this?
[5727.74s -> 5730.46s]  How do I like, how do I get, how do I take the car
[5730.46s -> 5732.14s]  and like slowly get off the exit
[5732.14s -> 5734.06s]  and like get us off this highway?
[5734.06s -> 5734.94s]  You know what I mean?
[5734.94s -> 5739.59s]  All right, the next one coming up
[5739.59s -> 5741.75s]  is going to be in the same world, I think.
[5742.39s -> 5755.00s]  And I, wait, there is, there are Titanic books.
[5755.00s -> 5758.97s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5758.97s -> 5765.61s]  We have a paragraph, Andy here.
[5765.61s -> 5770.90s]  The film based on the book and with advice from the Lord
[5771.70s -> 5773.62s]  was released in 1958.
[5773.62s -> 5775.38s]  Lord also served as a consultant
[5775.38s -> 5777.54s]  to Canadian film director James Cameron
[5777.54s -> 5779.78s]  while he was making the film Titanic.
[5779.78s -> 5781.94s]  That is precisely what I'm talking about.
[5781.94s -> 5784.02s]  That is precisely what I was talking about.
[5784.02s -> 5785.62s]  I'm so glad we get to turn off the exit now.
[5786.33s -> 5788.65s]  Yes, it was, somebody wrote a book.
[5790.33s -> 5792.41s]  You just got back on the highway.
[5792.41s -> 5794.25s]  Somebody wrote a book based on this
[5794.25s -> 5797.02s]  and that's what the movie was based on.
[5797.02s -> 5798.70s]  I, you know, I might say things
[5798.70s -> 5801.34s]  completely fucked up sometimes, but you know what I mean.
[5801.34s -> 5806.62s]  Coming up next is Stolen.
[5806.62s -> 5821.58s]  The film based on the book with advice from Lord
[5821.58s -> 5822.54s]  was released in 1958.
[5822.54s -> 5826.14s]  Lord also served as consultant to, so somebody wrote a book
[5826.14s -> 5829.26s]  and then they consulted on the movie about Titanic,
[5829.26s -> 5831.11s]  about like that happening.
[5831.11s -> 5834.12s]  Okay, like the story that he wrote.
[5834.50s -> 5835.54s]  All right, sounds good.
[5835.54s -> 5837.94s]  Um, I think the Xbox is wrong with it.
[5837.94s -> 5844.44s]  No, not the Lord, Lord?
[5844.44s -> 5846.76s]  Did somebody write something named Lord?
[5852.23s -> 5852.63s]  There we go.
[5852.63s -> 5854.23s]  Okay, I thought the disc was broken or something.
[5862.14s -> 5863.98s]  Everyone else disagrees with you and that guy.
[5865.18s -> 5876.58s]  At least I got one, one person here that can help me.
[5876.58s -> 5881.59s]  This game is called Stolen.
[5881.59s -> 5882.31s]  No, I agree.
[5882.31s -> 5882.95s]  I exist.
[5882.95s -> 5883.59s]  I'm here.
[5904.31s -> 5906.95s]  Oh, the goofy movie was the book before it was the movie.
[5931.21s -> 5932.73s]  There was a, wait, what's happening?
[5933.21s -> 5935.61s]  I feel like we're getting the whole movie spoiled by the trailer.
[5963.66s -> 5964.70s]  They're doing it.
[5964.70s -> 5965.42s]  They're doing it.
[5965.42s -> 5966.06s]  They're doing it.
[5966.06s -> 5966.62s]  They're doing it.
[5966.62s -> 5971.02s]  I get to, they're doing it.
[5971.02s -> 5978.17s]  I need to calm down because they're doing it.
[5978.17s -> 5979.75s]  Okay, I'm going to relax.
[5979.75s -> 5984.04s]  I didn't want to do that.
[5984.04s -> 5987.29s]  I don't, what did I just do?
[5987.29s -> 5992.50s]  Why am I doing this right now?
[5992.50s -> 5992.90s]  What's that?
[5992.90s -> 5993.38s]  What am I doing?
[6004.73s -> 6005.21s]  Silent.
[6009.18s -> 6010.22s]  This could be a scorn like.
[6010.22s -> 6011.10s]  Good evening.
[6011.10s -> 6012.70s]  I'm Jacqueline Meadows.
[6012.70s -> 6014.54s]  Tonight's top news story.
[6014.54s -> 6018.06s]  The heat is rising in the run-up to the city's elections.
[6018.62s -> 6021.66s]  Earlier today, Mayor Thomas Morgan made a public appearance
[6021.66s -> 6025.90s]  at the Metropolitan Art Museum's Japanese Treasures opening.
[6025.90s -> 6030.54s]  And once I'm re-elected, we'll bring more international
[6030.54s -> 6033.50s]  treasures like this one to Ford City.
[6035.80s -> 6039.08s]  While the mayor's main rival, candidate Richard Killian,
[6039.08s -> 6042.76s]  unveiled his anti-crime platform in a televised address.
[6043.56s -> 6048.28s]  For years, crime thrived under Morgan's reign, but no more.
[6057.35s -> 6060.63s]  I don't know about you, but I hate this city.
[6061.59s -> 6066.39s]  It's cold, it's dirty, it's home to far more sinners than saints.
[6068.30s -> 6070.06s]  Myself among them, truth be told.
[6071.50s -> 6073.34s]  Yeah, they say things are about to change.
[6073.98s -> 6077.74s]  20 years now, I've been hearing the same thing again and again.
[6079.42s -> 6081.02s]  But nothing ever changes.
[6081.02s -> 6083.58s]  Same old victims, same old crimes.
[6085.18s -> 6086.94s]  That's an endless problem.
[6086.94s -> 6089.42s]  Unless that is, you happen to be the problem.
[6098.54s -> 6120.52s]  Wait, is this that guy's apartment?
[6123.21s -> 6124.41s]  Good of you to drop in.
[6125.05s -> 6125.93s]  So what kept you?
[6126.49s -> 6128.33s]  Just a little pest problem.
[6128.33s -> 6129.45s]  What can I say?
[6129.45s -> 6130.57s]  I'm a popular girl.
[6131.37s -> 6131.93s]  All done.
[6132.97s -> 6134.49s]  I thought those were all screens.
[6134.49s -> 6135.45s]  It's gonna work this time?
[6135.45s -> 6136.17s]  It's just a window?
[6136.17s -> 6138.57s]  It'll work fine until you break it.
[6140.25s -> 6141.91s]  Wish me luck.
[6160.57s -> 6161.37s]  All right, let's do it.
[6163.10s -> 6163.60s]  Whoa!
[6164.14s -> 6176.44s]  Okay, there's that.
[6176.44s -> 6177.08s]  There's a crouch.
[6177.64s -> 6179.48s]  There's a punch.
[6184.26s -> 6186.10s]  Press A to go across gaps.
[6193.78s -> 6196.34s]  Run at the...
[6196.34s -> 6203.83s]  Stop that, okay?
[6203.83s -> 6205.83s]  Swing and jump off a pole to the opposite roof.
[6212.79s -> 6225.96s]  My god, this is crazy.
[6227.34s -> 6228.14s]  All right.
[6233.13s -> 6233.61s]  Press...
[6233.61s -> 6235.45s]  Oh, I didn't see that.
[6235.45s -> 6236.17s]  What did it say?
[6236.17s -> 6239.40s]  Press and hold R to run up the wall.
[6241.19s -> 6247.00s]  Oh, press...
[6247.00s -> 6250.30s]  It's kind of hard to read.
[6250.30s -> 6253.45s]  Press A after jumping at the pole to swing off it immediately.
[6256.89s -> 6257.39s]  Nice.
[6260.82s -> 6262.18s]  This seems pretty sick.
[6262.18s -> 6266.65s]  This seems pretty good.
[6266.65s -> 6269.05s]  I start to view the objectives screen.
[6269.05s -> 6271.61s]  Left thumb stick to scroll the GPS map.
[6271.61s -> 6274.97s]  Okay.
[6288.58s -> 6289.08s]  Okay.
[6294.28s -> 6296.89s]  Okay, now what?
[6296.89s -> 6308.46s]  Pretty cool.
[6308.46s -> 6331.08s]  Okay.
[6333.52s -> 6334.64s]  20 FPS?
[6334.64s -> 6335.68s]  Yeah, it's an old game.
[6336.32s -> 6343.72s]  First person mode.
[6343.72s -> 6356.06s]  How do I get out?
[6356.06s -> 6357.52s]  Okay.
[6357.52s -> 6359.40s]  Well, who cares?
[6359.40s -> 6363.10s]  The game is quiet.
[6365.05s -> 6365.77s]  Not anymore.
[6366.33s -> 6370.35s]  I like those glasses.
[6379.08s -> 6380.84s]  Use Up or Down to bring your inventory.
[6380.84s -> 6382.60s]  Press the first person mode.
[6382.60s -> 6387.87s]  Dude, wait a minute.
[6387.87s -> 6389.39s]  This really is Metal Gear.
[6431.24s -> 6434.91s]  What do I do now?
[6434.91s -> 6447.16s]  Is he asleep?
[6447.16s -> 6463.31s]  He's asleep standing up.
[6463.31s -> 6476.06s]  This guy is not doing good.
[6476.06s -> 6484.14s]  Can I take his gun?
[6484.14s -> 6484.94s]  Okay.
[6497.10s -> 6498.22s]  Sonic emitter.
[6498.22s -> 6508.96s]  Press once placed to...
[6508.96s -> 6512.73s]  Okay, how do I...
[6512.73s -> 6514.33s]  It's very confusing to use items.
[6514.33s -> 6516.41s]  I have to go into first person mode.
[6517.40s -> 6519.40s]  And then I can't walk anymore.
[6519.40s -> 6521.40s]  And then I have the sonic emitter now.
[6521.96s -> 6524.49s]  Which there's a person over here.
[6525.84s -> 6527.76s]  Which activate the emitter.
[6528.56s -> 6532.75s]  Is he going to open the door?
[6552.04s -> 6553.72s]  And it's inverted.
[6553.72s -> 6565.90s]  He just shined the light at me.
[6565.90s -> 6566.86s]  How did he not see me?
[6571.20s -> 6571.70s]  Steel?
[6573.72s -> 6574.22s]  Hey.
[6591.29s -> 6592.65s]  Oh my god, he's just done that.
[6606.00s -> 6607.12s]  Wait, he doesn't remember?
[6607.52s -> 6639.74s]  Just gonna say how is he missing?
[6639.74s -> 6641.98s]  Your AI is not smart enough to hit me moving.
[6641.98s -> 6642.54s]  Guarantee it.
[6643.10s -> 6653.26s]  Okay.
[6653.26s -> 6675.53s]  Oh, the framerate just got to 60.
[6675.53s -> 6682.12s]  That's a good change.
[6686.94s -> 6688.86s]  All this stuff must be worth a fortune.
[6689.50s -> 6692.14s]  One of the technicians said that Jade's statue alone
[6692.14s -> 6693.42s]  is worth more than my house.
[6694.06s -> 6694.54s]  So what?
[6694.54s -> 6695.42s]  I seen your house.
[6696.06s -> 6698.94s]  All I'm saying is they should put that on display
[6698.94s -> 6701.34s]  instead of hiding it away in the research lab.
[6701.98s -> 6704.30s]  Yeah, but it's like really old.
[6704.30s -> 6705.98s]  Those museum boys want to prod it
[6705.98s -> 6708.06s]  and poke it a bit while they have the chance.
[6708.06s -> 6709.34s]  Remember the time we were in the museum?
[6709.34s -> 6710.22s]  Let's lock up here and get a coffee.
[6710.22s -> 6711.66s]  And you and I got to fight.
[6711.66s -> 6721.84s]  Are you concerned about this?
[6721.84s -> 6725.82s]  Or is this supposed to happen?
[6725.82s -> 6727.34s]  Oh, that's...
[6727.34s -> 6735.84s]  Stolen.
[6735.84s -> 6736.72s]  Lockpicking.
[6736.72s -> 6770.64s]  Oh, that like hurts.
[6770.64s -> 6772.72s]  Oh, I have to very lightly hold it.
[6772.72s -> 6775.84s]  We need a new emote.
[6777.71s -> 6779.55s]  There's like 10, 20 new emotes.
[6779.55s -> 6812.84s]  What do you mean?
[6812.84s -> 6818.06s]  Let's go!
[6818.06s -> 6818.78s]  Hold to whistle.
[6818.78s -> 6821.82s]  You might need to make the whistle.
[6821.82s -> 6822.46s]  How do I look?
[6822.46s -> 6823.50s]  Wait, I can scan through the...
[6854.03s -> 6856.30s]  It's not working.
[6856.30s -> 6865.24s]  Where's my sonar?
[6865.24s -> 6868.46s]  Use the scan?
[6868.46s -> 6883.52s]  Eliminate the sonic visor view.
[6884.16s -> 6887.39s]  Or illuminate the sonic visor?
[6887.39s -> 6890.40s]  I don't have...
[6890.40s -> 6892.40s]  Where's my sonic visor?
[6892.40s -> 6907.87s]  Where's the sonic visor?
[6907.87s -> 6926.67s]  Wow.
[6926.67s -> 6927.55s]  D-pad left?
[6930.88s -> 6932.40s]  D-pad right is that.
[6932.40s -> 6934.96s]  D-pad down is this.
[6934.96s -> 6937.20s]  D-pad left doesn't seem to do anything.
[6937.20s -> 6940.88s]  This is like zoom mode.
[6940.88s -> 6941.92s]  This is whistle mode.
[6942.97s -> 6943.93s]  This is punch.
[6943.93s -> 6944.65s]  This is jump.
[6962.91s -> 6974.14s]  I actually think that kind of helped.
[6974.14s -> 6978.27s]  Sneak up behind this guard
[6978.27s -> 6980.19s]  and while standing press X to put him in choke hold.
[6980.19s -> 6986.67s]  Why am I moving so slow?
[6986.67s -> 6987.39s]  What are you doing?
[6987.39s -> 6988.11s]  Hurry up!
[6988.11s -> 7005.47s]  I snuck up and pressed X.
[7005.47s -> 7017.24s]  Oh, while standing.
[7017.24s -> 7017.80s]  Right, right.
[7017.80s -> 7018.28s]  Whatever.
[7018.28s -> 7020.51s]  Stole that.
[7022.25s -> 7030.49s]  Anything else in here?
[7030.73s -> 7031.61s]  What's this?
[7031.61s -> 7048.16s]  They get up really quick.
[7048.16s -> 7049.12s]  What is happening?
[7049.12s -> 7076.35s]  Your fucking aim is so annoying.
[7076.35s -> 7079.90s]  How do I get out of here?
[7080.46s -> 7082.96s]  There's a vent, vent, vent, vent, vent, vent, vent.
[7082.96s -> 7083.60s]  Vent!
[7083.60s -> 7084.24s]  Get in the vent!
[7084.80s -> 7086.08s]  Get in the vent!
[7088.73s -> 7089.05s]  God.
[7089.69s -> 7091.21s]  Make them shoot each other.
[7091.21s -> 7099.53s]  Now don't get up.
[7099.53s -> 7137.08s]  I thought he was going to get up.
[7137.08s -> 7142.09s]  I thought he was going to get up.
[7142.09s -> 7144.89s]  They got up before in like 15 seconds.
[7144.89s -> 7172.65s]  Nice.
[7172.65s -> 7173.37s]  Nice.
[7173.37s -> 7177.76s]  Anything else?
[7177.76s -> 7179.12s]  Ooh, I can steal in here.
[7179.12s -> 7188.46s]  Doesn't come back on, does it?
[7188.46s -> 7201.45s]  Really?
[7201.45s -> 7203.69s]  Ooh, an MP3 player.
[7203.69s -> 7204.73s]  Oh, okay.
[7236.62s -> 7238.84s]  My guards.
[7238.84s -> 7239.40s]  Night vision.
[7239.96s -> 7242.60s]  I don't, I don't want to use night vision.
[7242.60s -> 7243.56s]  No, I don't want to use it.
[7244.28s -> 7245.56s]  It looks worse.
[7245.56s -> 7260.48s]  I get it.
[7260.48s -> 7261.36s]  I get it now.
[7261.36s -> 7264.24s]  I'm using sonar through the walls.
[7264.24s -> 7285.04s]  Pretty sick.
[7285.04s -> 7309.82s]  Is anybody there?
[7324.14s -> 7329.60s]  I'm like chewing on wet concrete trying to use the inverted controls.
[7329.60s -> 7346.32s]  It's just like, I'm just like.
[7351.20s -> 7352.54s]  I don't know what it means.
[7352.54s -> 7357.02s]  What the fuck does that mean?
[7357.93s -> 7358.73s]  I don't do this.
[7358.73s -> 7360.49s]  It's, I'm just using a phrase.
[7360.49s -> 7364.17s]  Stop moaning.
[7364.81s -> 7371.40s]  I'm going to do whatever I want.
[7371.40s -> 7372.86s]  Right.
[7372.86s -> 7373.90s]  Where is this guy?
[7373.90s -> 7380.41s]  Press A to select the hacking target.
[7380.41s -> 7383.80s]  Use the left dump stick to copy the computer sequence.
[7383.80s -> 7384.52s]  Right dump stick.
[7384.52s -> 7385.88s]  L and R control the camera.
[7385.88s -> 7404.03s]  Jerma, you're a brat.
[7404.03s -> 7405.23s]  What's going on?
[7405.23s -> 7407.47s]  What was, what happened?
[7407.47s -> 7408.75s]  How did I fail the hack?
[7408.75s -> 7438.43s]  Do I even need the key anymore?
[7438.43s -> 7440.92s]  I don't need the key.
[7468.20s -> 7482.80s]  We're good.
[7482.80s -> 7483.61s]  Everything's fine.
[7515.68s -> 7516.16s]  What?
[7516.16s -> 7516.64s]  What?
[7516.64s -> 7541.63s]  What?
[7541.63s -> 7542.13s]  What?
[7542.75s -> 7563.29s]  Dude, this guy's fucking final boss.
[7564.01s -> 7574.06s]  All right.
[7574.06s -> 7575.69s]  Steal.
[7575.69s -> 7576.41s]  Steal.
[7576.41s -> 7589.66s]  Oh my God.
[7589.66s -> 7592.46s]  The analog just fucked me up, guys.
[7592.46s -> 7593.42s]  The analog went like.
[7617.16s -> 7618.28s]  Oh, come on.
[7618.28s -> 7619.40s]  Get away from me.
[7619.40s -> 7620.28s]  Give me a break.
[7620.28s -> 7627.26s]  Turn around.
[7627.26s -> 7629.34s]  Don't point the flashlight on me.
[7629.34s -> 7629.84s]  Fuck.
[7630.38s -> 7650.60s]  The buttons are so fucked up.
[7650.60s -> 7651.64s]  I promise.
[7651.64s -> 7653.40s]  It's such a weird game to play.
[7671.63s -> 7672.13s]  Shoot him.
[7672.84s -> 7673.34s]  Shoot.
[7706.17s -> 7706.41s]  Okay.
[7706.41s -> 7707.05s]  Now what?
[7707.05s -> 7707.55s]  Get out.
[7714.26s -> 7717.78s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[7722.11s -> 7722.61s]  Yes.
[7723.39s -> 7724.39s]  I'm good.
[7733.84s -> 7743.01s]  I kind of like this game.
[7743.01s -> 7743.51s]  It's fun.
[7744.13s -> 7748.93s]  The night vision mode looks like you're inside of a Mountain Dew bottle.
[7748.93s -> 7753.82s]  True.
[7753.82s -> 7771.57s]  I like those glasses though.
[7771.57s -> 7773.09s]  Those glasses are awesome.
[7773.09s -> 7775.49s]  The door uses a swipe card system.
[7775.49s -> 7784.98s]  If you kill the power, it'll release the light.
[7784.98s -> 7785.78s]  I missed that.
[7785.78s -> 7786.74s]  What did they, what did he say?
[7787.46s -> 7789.78s]  He said that uses something.
[7790.74s -> 7792.90s]  We'll lose something about a lock.
[7793.62s -> 7799.74s]  Kill the power.
[7800.38s -> 7818.56s]  What does it want me to do?
[7818.56s -> 7820.94s]  I wasn't paying attention either.
[7820.94s -> 7822.54s]  See, I'm not the only one.
[7822.54s -> 7829.12s]  Okay, hold on.
[7829.12s -> 7832.86s]  Should I go in the middle here?
[7832.86s -> 7836.93s]  He said it out loud.
[7836.93s -> 7838.85s]  But I didn't comprehend it.
[7838.85s -> 7848.99s]  It was like something about using the light to see where I can go or something.
[7849.71s -> 7853.76s]  Something to do with my, maybe an emitter.
[7856.64s -> 7857.84s]  Turn power off.
[7857.84s -> 7861.22s]  I don't know how to do that though.
[7861.22s -> 7872.59s]  Destroy the electricity?
[7873.23s -> 7876.27s]  I'm picking up some.
[7876.27s -> 7882.82s]  How am I supposed to do this?
[7884.61s -> 7887.01s]  Louie, you're full of surprises.
[7887.81s -> 7891.50s]  I just walk through this like who cares?
[7895.33s -> 7897.25s]  It is not an alarm.
[7897.25s -> 7898.45s]  It's a Tesla coil.
[7899.09s -> 7900.53s]  I thought it was an alarm system.
[7901.39s -> 7902.75s]  It's not an alarm.
[7903.63s -> 7904.83s]  This shit zaps you.
[7908.69s -> 7913.82s]  Okay, so now I need a different solution than this.
[7913.82s -> 7916.54s]  So I need to shoot something that's emitting this.
[7917.66s -> 7920.46s]  And I should have listened to the guy talking.
[7952.14s -> 7953.66s]  No, this is going to suck.
[7953.66s -> 7954.70s]  I'm so dead.
[7954.70s -> 7964.53s]  Get up.
[7964.53s -> 7967.26s]  I can't get up from here.
[7971.62s -> 7974.59s]  Oh my god.
[7974.59s -> 7975.79s]  Okay, I get it.
[7975.79s -> 8000.43s]  What are you?
[8000.43s -> 8004.16s]  What?
[8004.16s -> 8005.04s]  What was that?
[8005.04s -> 8005.60s]  Why did that?
[8005.60s -> 8006.16s]  I didn't press.
[8006.16s -> 8007.60s]  I did not press A.
[8007.60s -> 8010.40s]  I didn't even press A.
[8010.40s -> 8011.04s]  I didn't even jump.
[8011.04s -> 8056.29s]  That was weird.
[8056.29s -> 8056.85s]  Got it.
[8056.85s -> 8065.90s]  It's a lot of trouble just for one door.
[8065.90s -> 8067.10s]  Can we use the Xbox now?
[8069.50s -> 8072.69s]  Remember, you should put matching shades on.
[8072.69s -> 8083.62s]  I can't just jump over the fence.
[8084.26s -> 8086.67s]  That seems kind of...
[8086.67s -> 8087.63s]  There's no way, right?
[8087.63s -> 8088.11s]  Look at this.
[8088.11s -> 8090.11s]  It wants me to go like boink up.
[8090.11s -> 8092.83s]  This is not a chance.
[8092.83s -> 8093.79s]  It does not want me to do that.
[8111.12s -> 8119.23s]  Is something funny?
[8119.23s -> 8120.11s]  No, I don't feel like it.
[8121.31s -> 8143.50s]  There are more than two people here?
[8144.06s -> 8144.88s]  There are.
[8144.88s -> 8146.24s]  Okay, there's one down there and one over here.
[8170.11s -> 8171.47s]  Get out of fucking fr-
[8171.47s -> 8172.59s]  I'm done with this fucking game.
[8172.59s -> 8173.55s]  I'm done with it.
[8173.55s -> 8174.27s]  I'm done.
[8174.27s -> 8175.23s]  I don't play this one anymore.
[8175.23s -> 8176.11s]  I'm done playing this one.
[8176.11s -> 8177.95s]  This one was fun for a few minutes.
[8177.95s -> 8179.81s]  I'm going to put on this one.
[8185.70s -> 8191.63s]  Death Row Underground Team Combat.
[8191.63s -> 8193.15s]  That was fun for a minute.
[8193.15s -> 8199.23s]  Seeing some pogs on this one.
[8199.23s -> 8200.19s]  This is a good one.
[8200.19s -> 8204.53s]  Can you do a piss break?
[8204.53s -> 8206.03s]  Do you guys need a piss break?
[8206.03s -> 8207.07s]  You guys good?
[8207.07s -> 8210.66s]  Piss break?
[8210.66s -> 8211.62s]  What do you think?
[8211.62s -> 8211.94s]  Yeah?
[8211.94s -> 8212.74s]  Maybe?
[8212.74s -> 8213.98s]  You guys need a piss break?
[8217.30s -> 8218.72s]  Yeah?
[8218.72s -> 8219.36s]  No?
[8219.36s -> 8220.46s]  All right, fine.
[8220.46s -> 8221.18s]  We'll do it.
[8221.18s -> 8222.06s]  It's been a few hours.
[8222.06s -> 8223.26s]  It's been like two and a half hours, right?
[8223.26s -> 8224.06s]  Yeah.
[8224.06s -> 8224.80s]  All right.
[8224.80s -> 8225.60s]  We'll take a quick break.
[8225.60s -> 8226.40s]  I'll be right back.
[8226.40s -> 8227.68s]  I'll see you guys in a minute.
[8227.68s -> 8232.78s]  We'll come back with Death Row fighting game or something.
[8232.78s -> 8541.65s]  I'll be right back.
[8541.65s -> 8542.93s]  I have returned back.
[8543.97s -> 8545.54s]  Hello.
[8545.54s -> 8548.37s]  How's it going?
[8548.37s -> 8553.70s]  Okay, here it is.
[8553.70s -> 8554.82s]  Uh, here you go.
[8555.38s -> 8557.60s]  See it, right?
[8557.60s -> 8559.17s]  Can you hear it?
[8559.17s -> 8559.81s]  Good.
[8559.81s -> 8561.18s]  Okay.
[8561.18s -> 8563.58s]  Uh, this is not what I thought it was going to be.
[8564.22s -> 8565.38s]  Not even close.
[8566.56s -> 8568.96s]  I thought this was going to be a game where you fight.
[8568.96s -> 8571.76s]  It's like a big brawl of underground fighting.
[8572.40s -> 8574.72s]  I think it's a sport.
[8574.72s -> 8579.74s]  It's some kind of sport.
[8581.18s -> 8582.14s]  It's like basketball.
[8582.14s -> 8585.28s]  But with a disc or something.
[8585.92s -> 8588.03s]  Should we do sports view?
[8588.03s -> 8589.55s]  Or it's probably sports view, right?
[8590.67s -> 8604.34s]  The droids versus the blitzards.
[8604.34s -> 8608.35s]  How do you play?
[8608.91s -> 8615.07s]  This is my lineup.
[8615.63s -> 8635.47s]  Oh, definitely Blitz Andy versus the training droids.
[8644.50s -> 8698.51s]  What?
[8698.51s -> 8701.33s]  Did I get a point?
[8701.33s -> 8701.97s]  What?
[8701.97s -> 8706.48s]  Okay.
[8706.48s -> 8707.52s]  Where's the disc?
[8707.52s -> 8720.85s]  I just injured the droid.
[8721.49s -> 8727.10s]  Pass it, pass it, pass it, pass it, pass it.
[8727.66s -> 8728.93s]  Pass it over here.
[8730.32s -> 8731.20s]  Pass it.
[8731.20s -> 8748.99s]  Okay.
[8748.99s -> 8750.67s]  Oh, this is actually kind of cool.
[8751.31s -> 8783.28s]  All right.
[8783.28s -> 8784.16s]  Where's the disc?
[8784.16s -> 8794.66s]  Let's go.
[8794.66s -> 8795.94s]  R to locate the disc.
[8795.94s -> 8796.98s]  Isn't that what I'm pressing?
[8796.98s -> 8814.14s]  We're running by three points.
[8814.14s -> 8833.70s]  All right.
[8833.70s -> 8834.18s]  We win.
[8840.10s -> 8841.46s]  Replay the round.
[8851.06s -> 8853.46s]  That counts as two points?
[8853.46s -> 8854.42s]  I threw it behind.
[8855.22s -> 8866.03s]  Oh, that's when I was just injuring people.
[8869.38s -> 8869.78s]  Okay.
[8869.78s -> 8870.02s]  All right.
[8870.02s -> 8870.42s]  All right.
[8870.42s -> 8870.74s]  All right.
[8870.74s -> 8871.14s]  I get it.
[8871.14s -> 8871.54s]  I get it.
[8872.18s -> 8873.38s]  All right.
[8873.38s -> 8873.70s]  I get it.
[8873.70s -> 8874.10s]  I get it.
[8874.10s -> 8874.42s]  I get it.
[8875.06s -> 8875.46s]  I get it.
[8875.46s -> 8875.78s]  I get it.
[8875.78s -> 8876.58s]  We don't even do it again.
[8878.96s -> 8879.68s]  Game stinks.
[8880.32s -> 8881.28s]  I don't think it does.
[8887.82s -> 8889.02s]  Crowd sounds like a vacuum.
[8890.59s -> 8891.07s]  All right.
[8891.07s -> 8891.95s]  Single match.
[8891.95s -> 8892.67s]  Conquest.
[8894.50s -> 8895.14s]  Okay.
[8895.14s -> 8896.10s]  Conquest.
[8896.10s -> 8900.90s]  The Blitzers.
[8904.91s -> 8905.71s]  No rules.
[8906.43s -> 8909.70s]  Oh, these are the teams.
[8909.70s -> 8910.82s]  The Seacats.
[8910.82s -> 8912.00s]  The Protectors.
[8912.86s -> 8913.42s]  Convicts.
[8913.98s -> 8919.46s]  There are four teams in this league.
[8919.46s -> 8927.50s]  Who has the highest punch percentage?
[8927.50s -> 8933.78s]  It's convicts.
[8933.78s -> 8943.66s]  Convicts are the worst scum of the galaxy.
[8943.66s -> 8945.60s]  The most hardened criminals.
[8945.60s -> 8949.57s]  Senses to death for the most abominable acts.
[8951.04s -> 8955.44s]  Penitentiary governors lured them on with the promise that victory would lead to freedom.
[8955.44s -> 8957.84s]  It was mostly out of sheer bloodlust that they entered the arena.
[8957.84s -> 8963.41s]  For these guys, it's victory or death.
[8963.41s -> 8964.05s]  Okay.
[8964.05s -> 8967.34s]  Okay.
[8967.34s -> 8973.36s]  We've got Alvarez, Zeke, Becker, and Toro.
[8973.36s -> 8984.21s]  I don't think this really matters.
[8984.21s -> 8995.46s]  I'm going to challenge the Blitzers.
[8995.46s -> 9008.21s]  Is somebody behind you?
[9017.92s -> 9020.45s]  Where is he?
[9020.45s -> 9021.49s]  Oh, there you are.
[9021.49s -> 9023.62s]  Hey, Tacho.
[9023.62s -> 9024.58s]  Do you want to leave?
[9025.22s -> 9026.98s]  He's lying down over here.
[9027.70s -> 9028.62s]  Do you want to leave?
[9029.18s -> 9033.57s]  Do you want to leave?
[9033.57s -> 9035.63s]  Do you want to get out of here?
[9036.43s -> 9036.75s]  All right.
[9036.75s -> 9037.15s]  Let's go.
[9037.71s -> 9038.51s]  I don't see him.
[9039.07s -> 9039.63s]  Give me one sec.
[9061.70s -> 9062.50s]  Show Otto?
[9062.50s -> 9063.62s]  Oh, okay.
[9063.62s -> 9064.98s]  Um, he's got to get in the right spot.
[9064.98s -> 9066.02s]  Otto, go over here.
[9066.02s -> 9066.66s]  Come over here.
[9066.66s -> 9067.54s]  Let's go.
[9067.54s -> 9068.42s]  Go over that way.
[9068.42s -> 9070.40s]  Go over so they can see you.
[9070.40s -> 9077.58s]  Otto?
[9078.14s -> 9080.83s]  Hey, look up here.
[9080.83s -> 9082.75s]  Oh, you can kind of see his butt.
[9084.64s -> 9085.44s]  What's up?
[9085.44s -> 9086.70s]  Do you want to get out of here?
[9086.70s -> 9087.10s]  Okay.
[9087.10s -> 9087.50s]  All right.
[9087.50s -> 9087.98s]  We're back.
[9088.70s -> 9091.01s]  Let's go.
[9092.59s -> 9094.03s]  Excited dog.
[9094.03s -> 9096.53s]  Cartoon.
[9096.53s -> 9097.41s]  Let's go.
[9097.41s -> 9257.15s]  Okay.
[9257.15s -> 9257.63s]  He's good.
[9260.99s -> 9262.48s]  I took that one out.
[9262.48s -> 9264.29s]  I think we saw all we needed to see.
[9264.85s -> 9274.70s]  I mean, what did I do?
[9274.70s -> 9285.98s]  Court is down.
[9285.98s -> 9286.88s]  Oh, I don't know.
[9290.42s -> 9290.82s]  I don't know.
[9291.46s -> 9295.84s]  All right.
[9295.84s -> 9296.48s]  We're putting in.
[9297.36s -> 9299.20s]  I feel like we're going to be in this one for at least half hour.
[9303.36s -> 9304.56s]  Maybe not, though.
[9304.56s -> 9306.18s]  This is Eragon?
[9307.36s -> 9309.84s]  That movie with the dragons?
[9309.84s -> 9310.48s]  Eragon?
[9310.48s -> 9311.04s]  Eragon?
[9311.60s -> 9312.08s]  Eragon?
[9312.82s -> 9313.54s]  Eragon?
[9313.54s -> 9314.18s]  Eragon?
[9314.18s -> 9317.49s]  Eragon?
[9317.49s -> 9319.66s]  Eragon.
[9319.66s -> 9328.93s]  Yo, this game.
[9328.93s -> 9330.45s]  People are excited about this one.
[9330.45s -> 9337.34s]  Okay.
[9337.34s -> 9338.14s]  Let's see it.
[9338.14s -> 9348.96s]  Why can I not hear this?
[9348.96s -> 9373.76s]  I don't hear anything.
[9373.76s -> 9374.40s]  Why can you?
[9374.40s -> 9374.88s]  That's weird.
[9386.24s -> 9386.48s]  Okay.
[9386.48s -> 9386.88s]  Now I can.
[9387.52s -> 9388.40s]  There's a cord loose.
[9389.12s -> 9389.89s]  All right.
[9389.89s -> 9390.53s]  Eragon.
[9394.24s -> 9395.68s]  Never saw this movie.
[9395.68s -> 9401.09s]  I haven't seen this movie.
[9401.73s -> 9408.10s]  It was a book?
[9408.10s -> 9413.36s]  That was weird.
[9413.36s -> 9415.84s]  A time without tyranny or fear
[9415.84s -> 9418.70s]  does fill this sky.
[9418.70s -> 9424.96s]  Thorix now rules.
[9427.12s -> 9433.81s]  Wicked shade enforces Galvatrix's iron rule.
[9433.81s -> 9437.50s]  The reach of despots is limited.
[9437.50s -> 9441.26s]  And even Galvatrix couldn't touch one unsuspecting farm boy.
[9441.98s -> 9444.06s]  A boy whose heart burned with hope.
[9444.06s -> 9445.58s]  Like old film?
[9445.58s -> 9447.26s]  What is this old film?
[9447.26s -> 9464.83s]  Okay.
[9489.14s -> 9489.94s]  Oh my god.
[9489.94s -> 9490.74s]  That was loud.
[9491.54s -> 9496.38s]  Those combos.
[9511.63s -> 9512.99s]  That was all my left ear.
[9513.71s -> 9514.77s]  This game is awesome.
[9515.41s -> 9517.25s]  Is it?
[9517.25s -> 9526.42s]  I thought that was her screaming.
[9526.42s -> 9563.34s]  It feels like we're watching a mobile game ad.
[9586.29s -> 9589.33s]  Jump and grab the rock ledge then use L to move across.
[9589.81s -> 9590.21s]  Got it.
[9591.94s -> 9593.06s]  Just make my way home.
[9604.42s -> 9608.83s]  Enough's enough.
[9610.48s -> 9612.08s]  Hold and hold R to draw your bow.
[9612.08s -> 9613.20s]  That just makes perfect.
[9613.20s -> 9616.56s]  It targets by moving R and fire.
[9625.31s -> 9643.55s]  It's so cool that he's using his camcorder to record this.
[9646.93s -> 9651.81s]  Dude this is what video games looked like back in like 2005, 2003.
[9652.69s -> 9656.86s]  The stone, Ardya.
[9656.86s -> 9658.82s]  Be the stone.
[9658.82s -> 9659.30s]  The stone.
[9659.30s -> 9660.74s]  And that you will live.
[9660.74s -> 9661.52s]  The stone.
[9662.48s -> 9662.88s]  Yes.
[9663.89s -> 9665.81s]  No the game looked like shit back then too.
[9665.81s -> 9666.29s]  Did it?
[9674.74s -> 9684.70s]  Fate destined to change our world.
[9684.70s -> 9690.32s]  Oh yeah there's dragons in this.
[9699.73s -> 9699.97s]  Cool.
[9701.95s -> 9703.94s]  Okay.
[9703.94s -> 9704.74s]  Power orbs.
[9705.46s -> 9707.04s]  I didn't find the secret egg.
[9710.96s -> 9717.78s]  I feel like I need to shake and then pop off at the end.
[9717.78s -> 9722.75s]  Eventually discovered that what he found in the spine was not a simple stone.
[9723.39s -> 9727.47s]  But a small blue.
[9731.01s -> 9737.31s]  The dragon quickly grew as out speaking.
[9737.31s -> 9741.39s]  He was furious that the egg was lost.
[9741.39s -> 9746.61s]  And he commanded Dosa to finally feed a new rider which strengthened the resistance.
[9746.61s -> 9754.85s]  Led by a group called the Varden.
[9754.85s -> 9756.53s]  Why is this pacing so cracked?
[9762.30s -> 9765.97s]  I think it's just it's hard to make a cutscene.
[9766.53s -> 9768.91s]  Especially back here in the day.
[9768.91s -> 9769.87s]  It's like hard.
[9771.86s -> 9776.34s]  You know how many hoops and strings that they had to pull through to just
[9776.34s -> 9778.66s]  to make any of this look like anything you care about?
[9779.62s -> 9782.91s]  There's so many tricks to make it even look like this.
[9803.47s -> 9808.72s]  Do I get to fly a dragon?
[9809.36s -> 9823.90s]  Am I cutting their heads off?
[9824.54s -> 9833.82s]  Use grapple combo grab stun for a few.
[9835.02s -> 9844.86s]  I'm just my body might want to sneeze so bad but I just can't.
[9866.83s -> 9868.83s]  Okay this game is pretty cool.
[9868.83s -> 9881.58s]  Oh my god.
[9882.70s -> 9890.43s]  How do I aim?
[9906.21s -> 9907.41s]  He's doing it too.
[9907.41s -> 9908.61s]  You figured out the strategy.
[9909.49s -> 9912.18s]  This is a tower defense game now.
[9912.82s -> 9918.85s]  I think I'm probably going to need some cannon towers in a minute.
[9919.49s -> 9921.98s]  After next round.
[9922.70s -> 9924.06s]  Probably two cannon towers in the front.
[9930.27s -> 9931.07s]  Fury mode?
[9934.50s -> 9935.14s]  L and R.
[9938.62s -> 9940.22s]  L and R sticks.
[9970.50s -> 9972.10s]  Pressure chest contain items break them.
[9973.62s -> 9974.12s]  What's in it?
[9978.38s -> 9979.10s]  Health orb?
[9979.66s -> 9983.82s]  No you have to put money or items weapons jewels something like that.
[9987.86s -> 9989.06s]  It better not be a health orb.
[9990.58s -> 10003.10s]  Okay it's loud.
[10005.17s -> 10006.05s]  That was it.
[10006.05s -> 10007.41s]  That was the start of it.
[10007.41s -> 10011.17s]  That was that was actually the start of it.
[10011.17s -> 10012.93s]  It's just slowed down.
[10039.71s -> 10077.79s]  Block.
[10077.79s -> 10082.67s]  Right now there's somebody that was like oh dude Aragorn the game this is my childhood.
[10082.67s -> 10084.35s]  And they're watching this right now.
[10084.35s -> 10090.50s]  They're going no it gets no it gets better.
[10090.50s -> 10092.18s]  I can't wait till the dragon shows up.
[10092.90s -> 10094.34s]  Wait till the dragon shows up.
[10094.34s -> 10107.60s]  Move the smithy.
[10107.60s -> 10109.44s]  That is a bloody sword.
[10109.44s -> 10120.08s]  I should wait shooting at them.
[10120.08s -> 10120.80s]  Keep steady.
[10120.80s -> 10141.74s]  That was awful.
[10141.74s -> 10144.54s]  Okay get close and then use your kill move.
[10144.54s -> 10149.86s]  Oh my god.
[10150.98s -> 10153.70s]  Who are these people that were doing this?
[10153.70s -> 10154.58s]  Why are we attacking these?
[10154.58s -> 10155.78s]  What's the point here?
[10155.78s -> 10160.86s]  Should we do fury?
[10161.58s -> 10162.14s]  Fury mode.
[10162.78s -> 10209.57s]  Play Rats too?
[10209.57s -> 10210.37s]  I already did.
[10210.37s -> 10214.80s]  Yeah it's called Aragorn.
[10214.80s -> 10216.98s]  What happened?
[10216.98s -> 10218.26s]  I just skipped wait we just what happened?
[10218.26s -> 10218.98s]  I missed the cutscene.
[10219.62s -> 10234.90s]  Stop getting so close.
[10237.70s -> 10238.50s]  Oh my god.
[10238.50s -> 10239.70s]  I'm just trying to get out of here.
[10240.58s -> 10271.17s]  All right let's go.
[10272.03s -> 10272.91s]  Let's go.
[10272.91s -> 10274.11s]  All right let's go.
[10274.11s -> 10282.67s]  Play Stuart Little.
[10282.67s -> 10284.43s]  No we have to get to the dragon part.
[10284.43s -> 10286.27s]  I'm not stopping this till the dragon's here.
[10311.63s -> 10312.43s]  Saving game.
[10312.43s -> 10312.99s]  All right good.
[10323.10s -> 10325.74s]  Rom has been given Aragorn an old sword.
[10325.74s -> 10327.42s]  Your attacks are now stronger.
[10327.98s -> 10335.38s]  Do your best Stuart Little impression.
[10336.30s -> 10339.26s]  Well I I think that it's going to be a really fun day today.
[10339.90s -> 10340.78s]  I have no idea.
[10340.78s -> 10341.50s]  I've never seen it.
[10341.50s -> 10342.62s]  I've never heard him talk once.
[10360.35s -> 10361.31s]  That was the Joker.
[10366.48s -> 10368.80s]  Can we start reading fire at people?
[10378.94s -> 10380.54s]  I do appreciate we're getting there quickly.
[10382.03s -> 10382.99s]  Quickly.
[10382.99s -> 10402.66s]  Everything is the Joker, Alex Jones, or Mr. Satan.
[10402.66s -> 10403.30s]  Or Trump.
[10424.19s -> 10424.99s]  How are there too many?
[10428.77s -> 10429.89s]  Headbutting this guy?
[10432.59s -> 10433.31s]  What do you want?
[10433.31s -> 10434.11s]  What are we doing here?
[10440.21s -> 10440.93s]  No!
[10440.93s -> 10441.17s]  No!
[10454.53s -> 10455.65s]  Jump to the ledge.
[10455.65s -> 10456.29s]  Where am I going?
[10461.06s -> 10462.42s]  That was far.
[10480.46s -> 10481.18s]  Yo.
[10481.18s -> 10488.37s]  He said not to fight.
[10488.37s -> 10509.60s]  I think they're supposed to be spawning over here
[10509.60s -> 10512.16s]  but the game is really confused about what's happening.
[10512.16s -> 10519.62s]  You jump.
[10519.62s -> 10520.66s]  Get up.
[10520.66s -> 10539.94s]  This was released on the 360 and PC.
[10539.94s -> 10543.02s]  I just missed an incredibly important thing.
[10544.75s -> 10545.95s]  You used magic.
[10545.95s -> 10548.66s]  A gift all dragon riders possess.
[10548.66s -> 10550.94s]  Concentrate.
[10550.94s -> 10551.34s]  Quickly.
[10551.34s -> 10552.38s]  The archers.
[10552.38s -> 10554.06s]  Stay sharp son.
[10554.06s -> 10555.26s]  Use your magic again.
[10555.26s -> 10565.95s]  I didn't even look.
[10566.51s -> 10578.16s]  Who gives a shit about magic?
[10578.16s -> 10579.60s]  I want to see the dragon.
[10579.60s -> 10589.89s]  Okay.
[10609.97s -> 10614.94s]  How did you miss that?
[10615.50s -> 10621.10s]  Did he just get knocked off the edge?
[10621.10s -> 10621.90s]  No wait what?
[10621.90s -> 10622.78s]  Oh no he just did.
[10622.78s -> 10623.66s]  Wait what?
[10623.66s -> 10625.02s]  I'm so confused what just happened.
[10629.71s -> 10630.99s]  Why is it going up?
[10630.99s -> 10647.89s]  Oh my god stop.
[10648.53s -> 10667.74s]  Let's go!
[10671.01s -> 10671.49s]  Let's go!
[10681.66s -> 10682.46s]  This camera.
[10682.46s -> 10684.22s]  I can't tell what's happening.
[10684.22s -> 10689.78s]  Let's move.
[10689.78s -> 10694.11s]  What's what's happening here?
[10694.67s -> 10696.05s]  What's the problem here?
[10696.61s -> 10705.90s]  What's the problem here?
[10705.90s -> 10717.44s]  What's the problem here?
[10717.44s -> 10726.48s]  Stuart Little 2 impression.
[10726.48s -> 10727.84s]  That's when they introduced the sidekick.
[10727.84s -> 10735.62s]  It was like a little dog right?
[10735.70s -> 10737.70s]  Stuart Little and Dougie Doo.
[10737.70s -> 10743.86s]  It was a bird.
[10744.42s -> 10745.22s]  Oh that's right.
[10745.22s -> 10745.78s]  Shit sorry.
[10746.34s -> 10748.59s]  I just made it up because I've never seen or heard of it.
[10749.47s -> 10751.39s]  The only time I knew what Stuart Little was
[10751.95s -> 10755.79s]  is because I saw like a TV commercial for it once.
[10756.83s -> 10759.36s]  And Dr House is in it.
[10769.47s -> 10770.27s]  Watch it right now.
[10770.83s -> 10777.25s]  Dude what are we doing?
[10777.25s -> 10778.37s]  How do I keep going?
[10783.01s -> 10784.37s]  Oh my god.
[10784.37s -> 10784.85s]  What do I?
[10798.35s -> 10799.23s]  But I mean.
[10799.39s -> 10799.89s]  I mean.
[10803.66s -> 10805.26s]  He's game sucks.
[10805.26s -> 10805.98s]  He sucks.
[10807.81s -> 10808.93s]  He sucks.
[10813.09s -> 10814.53s]  Dude he sucks.
[10820.85s -> 10822.69s]  All right aim at the right thing please.
[10826.69s -> 10828.45s]  All right roll off.
[10828.45s -> 10829.81s]  Do I have to you have to kill everybody.
[10834.94s -> 10836.70s]  I just want to fly around in a dragon.
[10837.26s -> 10850.22s]  Is the dragon talking this?
[10852.16s -> 10854.56s]  Is it like Aragorn you and I?
[10854.56s -> 10855.92s]  Is it like or is it deep?
[10855.92s -> 10857.28s]  It's like you and I must.
[10858.00s -> 10873.95s]  Dragon's a girl?
[10873.95s -> 10876.35s]  Oh okay so it but is it a deep?
[10876.83s -> 10880.35s]  Is it like or is it uh hold on.
[10886.35s -> 10888.19s]  Damn this game is blurry.
[10888.83s -> 10891.17s]  No no no no no no no no no no.
[10891.17s -> 10892.05s]  Spin it back around.
[10892.05s -> 10893.17s]  I want to spin it back around.
[10893.73s -> 10901.94s]  Does that help our cause?
[10901.94s -> 10902.50s]  Yes it does.
[10906.51s -> 10918.13s]  Nice okay.
[10920.58s -> 10921.94s]  All right let's go.
[10927.26s -> 10950.80s]  Aragorn police helicopter angle.
[10950.80s -> 10954.42s]  I just want to ride the dragon.
[10967.47s -> 10968.99s]  The Battle of Home Depot.
[10971.98s -> 10994.14s]  The dragon's probably 50 hours in dude.
[10994.14s -> 10995.42s]  I doubt that.
[10995.42s -> 11002.51s]  All right jump on this.
[11003.07s -> 11006.13s]  All right we need to hang on this.
[11006.85s -> 11018.50s]  What the hell is going on?
[11037.38s -> 11038.90s]  Oh my god they just get replaced.
[11038.90s -> 11039.94s]  Okay what I don't get this.
[11044.51s -> 11045.23s]  Like climb it.
[11047.84s -> 11049.60s]  I pressed up and he didn't even move.
[11053.25s -> 11053.97s]  I pressed up.
[11073.31s -> 11076.06s]  Let let it go.
[11077.34s -> 11079.10s]  Let it let go.
[11080.29s -> 11080.93s]  Let go.
[11081.65s -> 11115.71s]  I used the potty all by myself.
[11115.71s -> 11117.39s]  Time the person up for five minutes.
[11117.39s -> 11137.26s]  Can you fucking help?
[11137.82s -> 11151.94s]  Still in blight town.
[11152.82s -> 11157.12s]  Now what?
[11159.22s -> 11159.46s]  What?
[11164.18s -> 11165.62s]  What am I looking at here?
[11165.62s -> 11175.78s]  You'll play this but you won't play Spyro.
[11175.78s -> 11177.28s]  You don't know that.
[11177.28s -> 11182.83s]  Oh my god stop dodging.
[11182.83s -> 11183.87s]  I want to do the magic.
[11184.51s -> 11192.40s]  You have to stand completely still or it doesn't work.
[11192.96s -> 11202.86s]  Because that's the same button as hold on.
[11202.86s -> 11203.50s]  Get off.
[11210.98s -> 11214.38s]  Oh my goodness.
[11214.38s -> 11229.92s]  I just want to I just want to.
[11229.92s -> 11230.64s]  I'm gonna put it on easy.
[11230.64s -> 11233.57s]  I just want to ride the dragon.
[11233.57s -> 11234.85s]  Oh this sucks.
[11234.85s -> 11238.51s]  Does anybody know when it when I actually get to play the dragon?
[11238.51s -> 11241.92s]  It's the only reason why I'm still here.
[11250.54s -> 11251.66s]  Triangle is jump.
[11252.69s -> 11253.97s]  X is dodge.
[11254.69s -> 11256.05s]  A is attack.
[11256.05s -> 11257.57s]  It's just all wrong.
[11258.61s -> 11261.33s]  Holding left trigger activates magic mode.
[11261.33s -> 11264.29s]  Which sometimes it's or if it's not magic mode it's a dodge.
[11264.85s -> 11268.53s]  It's just it's just all over the place.
[11268.53s -> 11270.53s]  It's just it's not what you think.

[13523.84s -> 13537.07s]  Are we going to play Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb or Driver Parallel Lines.
[13541.57s -> 13542.45s]  What do you think.
[13542.45s -> 13551.76s]  I've seen a lot of both though.
[13551.76s -> 13552.48s]  Let's see.
[13553.60s -> 13555.84s]  Indiana Jones or Driver Parallel Lines.
[13555.84s -> 13560.86s]  Oh this actually is a lot of people that want both.

[13604.19s -> 13606.03s]  I don't think this one's backwards compatible.
[13606.91s -> 13607.71s]  All right what are we doing.
[13608.35s -> 13613.86s]  Pretty close but we're doing Driver Parallel Lines.

[13617.09s -> 13617.65s]  Well we'll see.
[13618.29s -> 13618.93s]  Let's see.
[13618.93s -> 13619.81s]  All right driver coming up.
[13620.45s -> 13623.36s]  No burning.
[13636.80s -> 13643.28s]  Driver 4 is Parallel Lines.
[13643.28s -> 13644.56s]  Driver is Parallel Lines.
[13647.09s -> 13648.13s]  You played Driver already.
[13648.13s -> 13649.09s]  I played Driver 1.
[13649.65s -> 13651.57s]  I didn't play the other ones.
[13651.57s -> 13655.04s]  We'll see whatever it is.
[13655.04s -> 13656.00s]  I don't know.
[13656.56s -> 13659.36s]  Tell me I've played this before.
[13659.92s -> 13662.03s]  I don't believe you.
[13662.03s -> 13667.81s]  What did you say?
[13669.34s -> 13670.46s]  You googled yourself.
[13671.50s -> 13673.58s]  I'm googling to see if there's a video of it.
[13673.58s -> 13679.44s]  Guys I've played thousands of video games
[13679.52s -> 13682.93s]  and I've made thousands of videos
[13682.93s -> 13684.29s]  over the course of 13 years.
[13684.29s -> 13685.49s]  12, 13 years.
[13685.49s -> 13689.01s]  I've streamed millions of different pieces of frames
[13689.01s -> 13690.21s]  have gone into my brain.
[13690.21s -> 13692.03s]  I don't remember.
[13692.03s -> 13692.75s]  Maybe I mean yeah.
[13693.55s -> 13694.91s]  There's like seven of these games.
[13694.91s -> 13696.19s]  Maybe I played one of them.
[13696.19s -> 13697.60s]  I don't know.
[13697.60s -> 13701.38s]  Do you know how many frames have gone in here?
[13701.38s -> 13717.38s]  How many actual animation frames have gone into my head?
[13717.38s -> 13717.78s]  Driver.
[13717.78s -> 13721.06s]  So the way Driver Parallel Lines.
[13721.06s -> 13723.14s]  Driver Parallel 4 is what I just said.
[13723.14s -> 13726.62s]  Driver Parallel Lines is just Driver 4.
[13726.86s -> 13728.14s]  How come it didn't say that on the box?
[13728.70s -> 13766.27s]  I don't think it is.
[13766.27s -> 13766.75s]  Right.
[13766.75s -> 13767.79s]  I remember this.
[13769.89s -> 13771.81s]  Okay I remember this now.
[13772.45s -> 13773.70s]  Drop me in Harlem.
[13779.90s -> 13781.66s]  One way or enough.
[13830.00s -> 13831.44s]  Liquor stores huh?
[13831.44s -> 13833.60s]  That mean you're on your way up or your way down.
[13834.48s -> 13865.82s]  I've already played this.
[13865.82s -> 13867.10s]  We're gonna do Indiana Jones.
[13867.10s -> 13877.60s]  I've already played it.
[13877.60s -> 13879.74s]  So wait so Driver 4.
[13879.74s -> 13882.14s]  I just maybe I thought oh I played Driver 4
[13882.14s -> 13884.38s]  because the name of the video was Driver 4.
[13884.38s -> 13887.20s]  So when I was like oh Driver Parallel Lines.
[13887.20s -> 13888.96s]  That's a different spin-off Driver game
[13888.96s -> 13890.00s]  that I've never played before.
[13902.08s -> 13910.19s]  Just put up a gameplay video and react to it.
[13910.19s -> 13910.51s]  All right.
[13910.51s -> 13935.36s]  Indiana Jones for the Xbox.
[13935.36s -> 13936.64s]  Adventure has a name.
[13936.64s -> 13942.43s]  Let me ask in the mod chat is he okay?
[13943.68s -> 13944.48s]  I drive.
[13944.48s -> 13948.72s]  Guys I've seen hundreds of billions of frames.
[13949.81s -> 13952.21s]  The amount of data that's been from this screen
[13952.21s -> 13954.21s]  put into here and me streaming it.
[13955.42s -> 13956.54s]  I've played.
[13956.54s -> 13957.82s]  Does anyone want to count the amount of games
[13957.82s -> 13959.82s]  I've played on stream or on YouTube?
[13960.70s -> 13962.86s]  It has to be at least like two or three thousand.
[13963.50s -> 13964.70s]  It has to be thousands of them.
[13965.26s -> 13966.30s]  At least two or three thousand.
[13966.86s -> 13972.99s]  Is it gonna get DMCA too?
[13978.69s -> 13980.53s]  Just say you forgot like a normal person.
[13980.53s -> 13981.76s]  I did.
[13981.76s -> 13982.80s]  That's and I'm just explaining.
[13988.11s -> 13992.13s]  All right we're good.
[13992.13s -> 13994.21s]  You are obliterated right now.
[14000.69s -> 14008.54s]  All right is it Harrison Ford?
[14008.54s -> 14023.57s]  Oh it should be that same guy that did Tom Hanks.
[14023.57s -> 14025.30s]  That'd be great.
[14025.30s -> 14058.98s]  I played this growing up.
[14058.98s -> 14059.86s]  It kind of sucks.
[14073.30s -> 14088.96s]  Pretty good.
[14088.96s -> 14090.08s]  You gotta check.
[14090.08s -> 14098.08s]  This guy has three acting credits.
[14098.08s -> 14100.46s]  They're all Harrison Ford.
[14100.46s -> 14105.66s]  Great doing a pretty damn good job.
[14106.22s -> 14133.18s]  So many of these games would just ledge grab Andes.
[14133.18s -> 14133.98s]  You know what I mean?
[14133.98s -> 14138.32s]  Like I said oh grab the ledge and pull yourself up the ledge.
[14138.32s -> 14147.57s]  Okay let me see.
[14147.57s -> 14148.69s]  He's so tired already.
[14148.69s -> 14150.85s]  No I'm I'm not tired right now.
[14151.41s -> 14153.09s]  What do you mean he's so tired?
[14153.09s -> 14165.30s]  Can I press something?
[14165.30s -> 14183.97s]  This water to fill up my canteen.
[14183.97s -> 14188.67s]  Can you drink it?
[14188.67s -> 14196.10s]  Why does it smell bad?
[14196.10s -> 14200.99s]  Why is he he's like uh there's gonna be an awesome cat puke here.
[14200.99s -> 14202.03s]  Be ready to clip it.
[14202.03s -> 14204.91s]  Be ready to clip this cat puke because you know it's coming.
[14204.91s -> 14235.78s]  How do I use that?
[14235.78s -> 14290.43s]  How do I use this machete?
[14290.43s -> 14291.95s]  You don't have one.
[14291.95s -> 14300.11s]  But didn't he say I'm gonna use my machete?
[14300.11s -> 14302.03s]  He didn't he say I'm gonna use my machete?
[14302.03s -> 14304.19s]  Or did he say I need to use a machete?
[14304.19s -> 14324.16s]  Oh let me do the yeah yeah every game had this shit.
[14324.16s -> 14335.74s]  Even Super Mario.
[14335.74s -> 14336.86s]  That's punch not jump.
[14338.11s -> 14360.19s]  B is jump.
[14360.19s -> 14369.76s]  Thank god machete.
[14370.32s -> 14392.00s]  Okay that's actually really good to know.
[14392.00s -> 14441.84s]  Mm-hmm that looked dangerous.
[14441.84s -> 14448.27s]  This is so boring now because I'm now aware of how long the ledge climbing is.
[14448.27s -> 14448.83s]  Thanks.
[14448.83s -> 14453.34s]  This game looks incredibly boring.
[14453.90s -> 14454.78s]  Not really.
[14454.78s -> 14455.74s]  It's just a game.
[14455.74s -> 14456.94s]  It's just a video game.
[14460.40s -> 14461.44s]  There's a jump.
[14461.44s -> 14462.00s]  There's a run.
[14462.00s -> 14463.76s]  There's a there's a slash.
[14463.76s -> 14470.85s]  We want driver.
[14470.85s -> 14472.61s]  We want driver parallel lines.
[14472.61s -> 14475.84s]  We want driver parallel lines.
[14475.84s -> 14488.91s]  These guys are no boy scouts.
[14488.91s -> 14494.56s]  According to the German video ran 4,800 hours of video.
[14495.86s -> 14500.26s]  Okay so 4,809 hours of video with the assumption that he's running at
[14500.34s -> 14501.06s]  60 hertz.
[14501.62s -> 14506.43s]  German has personally viewed over one million.
[14506.43s -> 14507.94s]  Is it billion?
[14507.94s -> 14511.06s]  That's one billion individual frames.
[14511.06s -> 14515.62s]  If it was 144 hertz it would be 2.4 billion individual frames.
[14517.09s -> 14517.89s]  Damn.
[14517.89s -> 14531.28s]  And that's what just makes it into videos.
[14531.28s -> 14531.84s]  Right.
[14531.84s -> 14535.60s]  And he can't remember the last 100.
[14535.60s -> 14541.46s]  Wait till you get older.
[14541.46s -> 14542.34s]  You'll see.
[14542.34s -> 14545.79s]  So wait till you get older.
[14545.79s -> 14546.91s]  Wait till you get a little older.
[14547.55s -> 14549.57s]  You'll see.
[14557.07s -> 14558.43s]  You're not gonna remember.
[14558.43s -> 14559.31s]  Yeah guys sorry.
[14559.31s -> 14564.03s]  I I mean I don't I remember kind of playing Spelunky when it came out.
[14564.03s -> 14566.59s]  But like I forgot that until I just thought about it.
[14566.59s -> 14581.12s]  I already have.
[14581.12s -> 14582.88s]  Yeah my memory is already bad.
[14582.88s -> 14584.34s]  Can I sneak?
[14605.01s -> 14624.32s]  How do I beat am I just gonna get it?
[14630.56s -> 14641.52s]  Get out of the menu dude.
[14641.52s -> 14642.88s]  All right sounds good.
[14642.88s -> 14659.34s]  Who made this game?
[14659.34s -> 14661.82s]  Hey it's me the American.
[14661.82s -> 14663.50s]  Everything you heard is true.
[14663.50s -> 14681.02s]  The fire killed me.
[14681.02s -> 14688.88s]  What the fuck is this garbage?
[14688.88s -> 14697.25s]  All right one last try.
[14697.25s -> 14709.42s]  One last try.
[14709.42s -> 14712.90s]  Guys they made the DaVinci code.
[14712.90s -> 14714.02s]  Same company.
[14714.82s -> 14721.10s]  Have I played all their games today?
[14721.10s -> 14723.81s]  They made Men in Black the game.
[14723.81s -> 14726.21s]  Star Trek Deep Space Nine.

[14737.28s -> 14739.54s]  The DaVinci code.
[14739.54s -> 14747.58s]  And then a cancelled game called Dirty Harry.
[14747.58s -> 14748.14s]  Interesting.
[14752.13s -> 14753.33s]  Interesting okay.
[14754.34s -> 14754.82s]  Very cool.
[14797.78s -> 14799.89s]  How do I reload the gun?
[14799.89s -> 14823.06s]  All right the game just got way better.
[14823.06s -> 14833.09s]  Because I can I get a chair.
[14833.09s -> 14834.61s]  Uh what is this?
[14834.61s -> 14837.18s]  Can I dig?
[14861.26s -> 14874.70s]  Let's try to do that.
[14874.70s -> 14882.11s]  It's doing that music.
[14882.11s -> 14884.35s]  It's doing the Star Wars type music.
[14884.35s -> 14888.43s]  The one that goes
[14891.58s -> 14902.72s]  And it is the best.
[14916.26s -> 14926.42s]  Press Y.
[14928.58s -> 14930.45s]  I'm pressing Y.
[14930.45s -> 14940.59s]  I get to it didn't do that last time.
[14940.59s -> 14955.62s]  We're good.
[14955.62s -> 14966.46s]  I remember this game on PS2.
[14966.46s -> 14968.78s]  It sucks balls.
[14968.78s -> 14977.79s]  That's such like a ridiculous term.
[14977.79s -> 14980.21s]  Like oh I played this before too.
[14980.21s -> 14981.49s]  This thing sucks balls.
[14982.05s -> 14993.79s]  Okay uh from here.
[14993.79s -> 14995.31s]  Where am I going?
[14995.31s -> 15001.33s]  Oh this thing sucks ass.
[15001.33s -> 15002.37s]  It's like what?
[15002.37s -> 15020.85s]  It's just uncomfortable.
[15020.85s -> 15022.05s]  Like how weird this is.
[15022.05s -> 15061.55s]  And dog shit.
[15061.55s -> 15063.39s]  It wasn't even good.
[15063.39s -> 15072.86s]  That wasn't even good.
[15072.86s -> 15085.62s]  All right so what the what am I what am I doing here?
[15085.62s -> 15093.57s]  What happened to my hat?
[15093.57s -> 15094.93s]  What's going on here?
[15094.93s -> 15101.81s]  Up there?
[15101.81s -> 15102.13s]  I don't.
[15137.22s -> 15145.39s]  Wait and where am I going?
[15145.39s -> 15158.37s]  You just that guy fucking ruined everything out of here.
[15158.37s -> 15165.28s]  All right I just I'm gonna rip the disc out.
[15165.28s -> 15166.24s]  I'm just gonna pull the disc out.
[15166.88s -> 15168.48s]  I'm gonna pull out the disc.
[15168.48s -> 15174.08s]  I'm gonna I'm just taking I'm just gonna take out the disc.
[15174.08s -> 15175.12s]  You know what I'm gonna do something else.
[15175.12s -> 15176.16s]  I'm gonna move on to another game.
[15177.04s -> 15179.44s]  I think I'm gonna take out the disc.
[15180.16s -> 15184.16s]  One more second.
[15184.16s -> 15185.28s]  I'm gonna give it 10 seconds.
[15191.04s -> 15217.63s]  Nine eight seven six five four three two come on.
[15217.63s -> 15218.67s]  Where's the water?
[15221.14s -> 15239.17s]  One and a half one and three quarters two two and a half two and three quarters three three
[15239.17s -> 15294.37s]  and a half four and a half all right let's try it again all right we're good done this
[15294.37s -> 15355.30s]  ought to even up the odd gun what do I do with this down there I don't know here please put it
[15355.30s -> 15360.77s]  down I I will in a second all right let's get a new pull up.
[15360.77s -> 15386.58s]  Do you want to see Brute Force or Blood Omen 2.
[15386.58s -> 15403.81s]  That's it Brute Force or Blood Omen 2.
[15403.81s -> 15405.25s]  What about the Fellowship of the Ring?
[15405.25s -> 15406.29s]  I beat the first level of that.
[15406.29s -> 15407.33s]  I don't play it ever again.
[15407.33s -> 15410.69s]  Tell us what those are.
[15410.69s -> 15411.33s]  I don't know.
[15411.33s -> 15412.96s]  I don't know what they are.
[15412.96s -> 15425.36s]  This one says dangerous alone deadly together and the other one says the other one says
[15425.36s -> 15442.94s]  the legacy of Kane which one that was fun it just wasn't very good it was all right if I
[15442.94s -> 15447.10s]  was a huge fan of Indiana Jones I would make sure I had that like just round out my whole collection.
[15447.10s -> 15455.04s]  All right Brute Force or uh Blood Omen 2.
[15455.04s -> 15467.89s]  Why do I feel like I've played one of these before somehow legacy of Kane I feel like
[15467.89s -> 15479.97s]  I probably played a long time ago I like the Xbox pause screen yeah I do too I just want to
[15479.97s -> 15487.41s]  make sure it's not here for that long because it burns into my screen legacy of Kane is real
[15487.41s -> 15497.58s]  shit okay well I think that's what you're voting for so we're gonna play legacy of Kane Blood Omen
[15498.14s -> 15503.36s]  2.
[15506.30s -> 15508.06s]  All right let's try it.
[15508.06s -> 15518.27s]  Soul Reaver on PS1 was really cool.
[15518.83s -> 15528.06s]  I feel like I remember that game is this stuff still burned in from the first day
[15528.06s -> 15532.88s]  no thankfully it turning the monitor off for a day or two helps it fixes it
[15538.56s -> 15546.85s]  yikes okay sorry so glad I turned that down because that was awful for me
[15555.86s -> 15565.92s]  Crystal Dynamics look at all these game studios that we all know Crystal Dynamics made this
[15566.56s -> 15594.90s]  this is Blood Omen 2 so we're we're jumping in like the third or fourth sequel of the game at
[15594.90s -> 15619.30s]  this point sorry we don't know what's going on they made the Avengers game this is on Steam
[15619.30s -> 15646.45s]  is it really cool you shouldn't be playing it I can't I'm being speech jammed I can't even
[15646.45s -> 15658.77s]  hear myself thinking somebody said you shouldn't you shouldn't be playing it if it's on PC yeah
[15658.77s -> 15678.98s]  but I mean I already put the disk in oh all right very cool let's go am I gonna get like obsessed
[15678.98s -> 15695.15s]  with this game yeah vibration on let's go am I hold and hold left trigger to block attacks
[15695.15s -> 15710.80s]  tap left trigger as each enemy attack starts I mean I feel like okay um it's a cat puke menu
[15710.80s -> 15727.52s]  maybe a little what's more fun I'll try the fun one yeah PC ports of old console games usually
[15727.52s -> 15733.06s]  are awful and the developer has not updated this for anything past like Windows 7 or something
[15733.06s -> 15736.86s]  so it's still a huge pain in the ass to actually get in that big problem this might be bugs
[15736.86s -> 15756.13s]  original hardware chapter one slums welcome to
[15757.33s -> 15771.17s]  Riddian it looks kind of crunchy it looks kind of crunchy
[15791.73s -> 15796.37s]  I could do it really good but I need the headphones out you want to do a good one
[15797.09s -> 15808.48s]  should I do a good one yes can I get a poll to see if I should do a good one yes or no
[15808.48s -> 15833.71s]  do you want me to go do an all-in all-bearer yes or no it's a checkpoint
[15857.76s -> 15863.28s]  we are in the oldest and most decrepit part of the city where few people dare to come
[15863.28s -> 15871.12s]  place to train train me you take me for a dog your memory has been shattered and your body
[15871.12s -> 15877.84s]  has lain dormant for 200 years what skills you had must be recovered before you can be of any
[15877.84s -> 15884.00s]  use to the cabal you must learn to fight and to survive I thought you were taking me to feed
[15884.56s -> 15892.06s]  patience vampire first knew that you are stronger and faster than mortal men oh there we go to jump
[15892.06s -> 15898.24s]  higher and farther than any human that ever lived wait what is this all bearer or all barely seek
[15898.24s -> 15908.30s]  for a place to jump all right 85 percent right now here we go I'm gonna go away from the mic
[15908.30s -> 15912.30s]  it's probably gonna be really really really annoying I go like this yeah I don't want to
[15912.30s -> 15927.42s]  be super awful I'm not gonna be on camera either oh oh my god I can't do it
[15928.06s -> 15942.02s]  chain chain he's your brother kane you destroy him pretty good pretty good I even doubt at the
[15942.02s -> 15950.27s]  end there actually even doubt pretty well at the end it was kind of rough at the beginning

[16132.77s -> 16155.23s]  I did it for like five seconds or so and we move on I missed it
[16158.16s -> 16165.78s]  hold on let me see how bad it really was people are like hurry up move on move on
[16165.78s -> 16170.18s]  we're good we're good let me just I just need to see how bad was it really was it really that bad

[16215.33s -> 16230.11s]  with that I mean those two like stepping on a fucking squeaky toy too hard that's not even that
[16230.11s -> 16246.24s]  loud that's not even that bad you guys are all making it up it wasn't loud it was just bad
[16246.88s -> 16275.07s]  let's play the game stop making us relive that what is going on right now you don't even know
[16275.07s -> 16283.20s]  who that is 75 percent of you don't know who paul bear is so I was just I just sounded like an
[16283.20s -> 16292.18s]  absolute what oh okay now that makes a lot more sense as to why everyone's like what's wrong with
[16292.18s -> 16331.50s]  you what movie is he from oh no oh no it's this it's this guy you tell me if I came close not bad
[16331.50s -> 16336.69s]  yeah so I didn't wait how many you guys really don't know that you don't know the reference
[16336.69s -> 16344.02s]  okay all right I'm not fucking around anymore I know like like 5 000 people just left they're
[16344.02s -> 16349.55s]  probably never coming back because thanks a lot thanks a lot guys thanks a lot now they're never
[16349.55s -> 16392.21s]  coming back okay x is pull the lever I thought it was from Star Trek when he goes no no it's

[16469.34s -> 16490.59s]  game to be played right now I do apologize but we need to watch this watch party I wish I could
[16490.67s -> 16522.34s]  apologize to those people that's not even close you could win a freak I'm already playing the
[16522.34s -> 16545.14s]  xbox right now all right that was I thought that was gonna be like a deep fake fan that person that
[16545.14s -> 16568.99s]  linked that okay all right let's play the game no more I'm not gonna have to scream anymore the
[16568.99s -> 16573.07s]  person that came in here like four hours ago hey dude scream as loud as you can hey I don't want
[16573.07s -> 16577.39s]  to do that I just did it because like I thought I think I thought like 15 000 people voted for it
[16577.39s -> 16582.43s]  but only a thousand people did and 17 000 people were sleeping and I just screamed and made them
[16582.43s -> 16607.06s]  wake up and now they hate me great he sought to move this victim but he met me instead
[16609.23s -> 16615.47s]  that was a good video actually loved and direct me to his throat drink then I will be waiting
[16616.27s -> 16627.09s]  no there's definitely not guys 90 percent of the audience does not sleep in a dead sleep
[16627.09s -> 16649.44s]  during the stream it's probably like five percent it's not that many if you are wounded seek out
[16649.44s -> 16656.62s]  blood to restore your vital must know too that by drinking the blood of others you will gradually
[16656.62s -> 16662.22s]  become stronger and harder to kill we call this a vampire's lore
[16671.81s -> 16702.80s]  you will need their blood to survive let us continue wait I thought that was like funny all
[16702.88s -> 16728.66s]  right remember your fly is done
[16732.10s -> 16745.66s]  while we are superior to humans in many ways we also have certain weaknesses that they do not
[16745.66s -> 16754.46s]  possess though it is life-giving to humans water is deadly to vampires its touch burns our skin
[16755.02s -> 16762.14s]  immersion in water can kill us avoid it at all costs also know that scattered throughout meridian
[16762.30s -> 16768.94s]  our relics of our ancestors useless to humans only vampires can access these coffins and use
[16768.94s -> 16786.77s]  the power within seek these out on your journey cool okay so don't just water if I could I if
[16786.77s -> 16797.14s]  I could go back and just delete the cane scream I would interested to go like shit I wish I could
[16797.14s -> 16802.18s]  I wish I could just go into the vod and just like just snip that part out and even if a jump cut
[16802.18s -> 16806.61s]  like people would be like what happened what why did that happen because I don't know must
[16806.61s -> 16829.04s]  make a glitch with the game or something he's so fixated on this Jesus am I supposed to be
[16829.04s -> 16845.78s]  drinking blood I think so thank god I wish I could go back in the vod and delete that part
[16845.78s -> 16855.38s]  just snip that part like just that right when I fell I have such a stupid idea okay I'm doing
[16855.38s -> 16861.70s]  it soon I'm gonna do it like within the next couple weeks I'm going to pre-record an entire
[16861.70s -> 16867.06s]  stream no I'm not even gonna tell you but you know what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna pre-record
[16867.06s -> 16882.56s]  a whole stream I just have to like cut all the shitty stuff that I do see how long see
[16882.56s -> 16889.97s]  what you what you guys do I spoke before that's called a YouTube video yeah but not the way you
[16889.97s -> 16901.10s]  think to destroy this they have developed special defenses you see here precisely does it do should
[16901.10s -> 16906.96s]  you so much as touch it you will be burned as by fire the seraphim have raised these wards
[16906.96s -> 16913.52s]  throughout meridian we can go no farther this way follow me into the sewer somebody's got it
[16914.16s -> 16928.88s]  yeah we're talking about as if I played through the game in one try like what kind of egomaniac
[16928.88s -> 16936.13s]  would you have to be what kind of megalomania of making it so I'm trying to make you guys think I
[16936.13s -> 16941.73s]  beat the game I did everything perfectly or something your first line of you have to be
[16941.73s -> 16950.66s]  kidding me give me a really hard game too using your inhuman speed you can also defend yourself
[16950.66s -> 16957.22s]  by blocking attacks I shall now strike at you this is what I said did I say megalomania
[16958.18s -> 16962.26s]  yeah you guys don't know what that is and we can proceed to the next lesson
[16962.98s -> 16981.79s]  press L to block oh this is the the perfect timing one okay cool hey it's not that bad
[16989.73s -> 16996.77s]  we are all armed with a natural weapon our claws use them to kill your enemies
[16997.49s -> 17017.46s]  you can practice by attacking me if you see an enemy become tired use this opportunity
[17017.46s -> 17028.45s]  to grab him once grabbed you can throw him a great distance hold and hold press Y to grab
[17029.01s -> 17056.82s]  and press wait are you doing like a choke oh okay excellent your lesson is over for the moment
[17057.62s -> 17063.38s]  continue through the sewer and I shall meet you again shortly that is unforgivable tonight
[17064.34s -> 17069.50s]  I think that everyone's been having fun I think everywhere chat's been all right
[17089.09s -> 17098.83s]  can you play conqueror's bad fur day oh when I do N64 I'm gonna do N64 eventually we'll play a
[17098.83s -> 17116.56s]  bunch of those yeah I'll do a full N64 collection kind of like this let's play a ton of it
[17117.28s -> 17124.42s]  here you are at last conqueror's on xbox yeah it is your first true test a gang of
[17124.50s -> 17133.36s]  are in camp number stands guard his fate approaches you must kill him kane you have
[17133.36s -> 17137.20s]  the skill to block and dodge his attacks first thing I see in chat is what I'm gonna eat tonight
[17139.04s -> 17145.12s]  once you have felled him drink his blood to restore yourself from any wounds you may receive
[17145.12s -> 17161.18s]  bagel I will be watching bagel look look look it was like chunks on this
[17174.05s -> 17198.26s]  fury okay did I miss it do pizza bagel you know there's a lot of stuff that is so good on a bagel
[17199.07s -> 17205.58s]  but people just don't ever think to do it bagel sandwiches and I'm not just talking about egg
[17205.58s -> 17210.51s]  I'm talking about tuna like a tuna melt on a bagel ham sandwich on a bagel
[17211.07s -> 17228.03s]  especially if it's warmed up and toasted oh yeah ham and cheese on a bagel is perfect
[17237.10s -> 17242.14s]  these are our supernatural abilities bagel french dip I've never had that sounds good though
[17243.58s -> 17249.42s]  giving us unique powers much of your former power cane has been weakened during your long
[17249.42s -> 17256.48s]  hibernation mist you see here can be used to your advantage rubin on a bagel you have the
[17256.48s -> 17264.32s]  ability to assume a missed form and become nearly invisible you can move silently to bring down our
[17264.32s -> 17269.92s]  prey from behind cream cheese and locks at times when you are outnumbered look for mist from which
[17269.92s -> 17274.40s]  to kill your enemies I really have to be in the mood for that though if you are pursued you can
[17274.40s -> 17281.20s]  hide in mist to escape now use this gift to kill those before you in the cemetery
[17282.24s -> 17289.98s]  corned beef is so nasty what oh it's not you just never had it made well maybe you have
[17290.62s -> 17308.78s]  okay missed it's like a stealth mode how useful how did you see me
[17308.78s -> 17334.06s]  me
[17340.54s -> 17363.79s]  should I go why does it keep telling me to do this I just did it legacy of
[17363.79s -> 17385.28s]  cane did I not yeah I got it what's the next step here up this way didn't I come what do you want
[17385.28s -> 17427.26s]  me to do I mean I did that already why I already stealth killed that person where do I go am I
[17427.26s -> 17446.00s]  missing something here oh I can go this way oh I actually can use weapons activate the weapon box
[17446.00s -> 17474.46s]  while holding a weapon doesn't hold to activate the weapon box while holding a weapon it's just
[17474.46s -> 17485.10s]  pretty good you should do a joke where you pretend that owls are in your room but you're the only one
[17485.10s -> 17494.82s]  that can hear them glyph energy eyes of the seraphim it supplies power to all of meridian
[17495.54s -> 17503.06s]  the gate you see can be opened using this energy activate the glyph box this will bring power to
[17503.06s -> 17544.66s]  the gates lever and allow you to open it it's fun it's fun oh 45 minutes without chapstick
[17544.66s -> 17551.14s]  what will you do if I do okay a secret society existing what do I get if I do that you may see
[17551.14s -> 17557.22s]  them working on glyphs from time to time they rarely talk with the townsfolk and very little
[17557.22s -> 17563.97s]  is known about their origins ahead is the market with a common dregs of meridian engage in their
[17563.97s -> 17570.37s]  filthy commerce beyond the market is the bridge that leads to the lower city make your way east
[17570.37s -> 17577.02s]  to the bridge I shall meet you there and where are you going I shall scout ahead to ensure that
[17577.02s -> 17583.10s]  you don't meet any seraphim patrols you aren't ready for them yet how trusting of you to leave
[17583.10s -> 17591.36s]  me to my own devices consider it an act of good will how many tubes of chapstick do you go through
[17592.24s -> 17598.14s]  um actually quite a few not because I use it too much but because I actually just lose them
[17598.78s -> 17604.14s]  they just disappear I'll use the same one for a week and then it's gone it does not exist
[17604.86s -> 17690.82s]  what's that try drink everybody's blood should I what was that powering stop this is why I
[17690.82s -> 17697.50s]  fucking hate streaming outside it's so annoying having just like an open roof screaming an open
[17697.50s -> 17700.86s]  roof germa streaming an open roof like you told you complain about your room being so hot just
[17700.86s -> 17706.98s]  take the roof off because I figured that'd be like still privacy and shit never listening to
[17706.98s -> 17786.35s]  you fucking idiots ever again I can't go in this what is it powering up here I'm bored um
[17786.91s -> 17791.71s]  I'm just kind of chilling out now I think we hit the peak with the pallbearer scream and now I'm
[17791.71s -> 17796.19s]  just like kind of you know I'm just chill I got all that out of me you know what I mean
[17796.19s -> 17828.02s]  just relax it now how much longer um at least until the chapstick wears off because I can't
[17828.02s -> 17841.09s]  leave for at least 45 minutes there are animals here all right this is fun but I am I'll do
[17841.09s -> 17846.34s]  something else it's a cool game I could see myself just sitting on the couch just playing this
[17846.34s -> 17878.94s]  it's very cool but I think I need to play it it's almost like jumping through a glass window
[17879.58s -> 17905.60s]  you've never loathed a game more in your life that's not true
[17905.60s -> 17924.93s]  hear this so-called leader's plans and learn what he thought his plans might be for me
[17925.73s -> 17933.57s]  cain this way I'm gonna play this game called maximum chase here close the gate
[17936.77s -> 17942.78s]  cain way to reach the lower city the smuggler's tunnel will take you there
[17942.78s -> 17951.15s]  pestilent vampire the grand hotel in the slums a contact will meet you there
[17951.15s -> 17957.63s]  he will tell you where to go stinking verminous bloodsucking fiend do you want your death now
[17958.51s -> 17967.55s]  come and you shall have it come back I was alone at last in a city changed beyond all recognition
[17967.55s -> 17974.19s]  in a lab like links should I flinks is available on the newer platform isn't it
[17975.15s -> 17979.63s]  I think you can play it on the game pass but answers were promised me in sanctuary
[17979.63s -> 17991.33s]  after that I would know what to do that's a good one that's pretty good keep going
[17991.89s -> 18024.74s]  I'm gonna put maximum chase yeah it's on game pass that was literally sick hair flick you guys
[18024.74s -> 18029.22s]  fumbled voting for that vampire game no that game is actually a classic video game it's actually
[18029.22s -> 18038.19s]  really good but I feel like it I don't know if I want to play um legacy of cain for like
[18039.25s -> 18049.58s]  20 hours takes a bit to ramp up all right what about this one
[18050.14s -> 18088.88s]  this based off a book well it's based off a movie clearly wait view film wait play the film
[18089.52s -> 18146.10s]  let's watch this it is fmv stop stop that stop it I'm gonna skip get those fucking flashlights

[18157.33s -> 18163.01s]  least a few of these they have to be facing the camera for all of them every single shot
[18170.26s -> 18180.38s]  oh my god stop put them down even this one it doesn't you don't need to have this guy doing this
[18180.38s -> 18204.96s]  stop aiming this shit in our faces why are they doing this make sure to take out the big case
[18204.96s -> 18212.03s]  that's just luggage that's luggage look at can I go back do you see that was this just luggage
[18212.59s -> 18222.83s]  this isn't like a big cool briefcase that was like a look at this light in your eyes

[20124.90s -> 20206.29s]  going one attempt only the rest of the game how smooth no I feel like the game is generating the
[20206.29s -> 20220.18s]  level 15 feet in front of me I don't know where I'm going but if the levels just here I please do
[20220.18s -> 20229.71s]  an ASMR video with this game okay so what we're gonna do here is some very quick mouth noises for
[20229.71s -> 20234.75s]  you to help you sleep I know you're listening to this because it helps you sleep at night
[20236.40s -> 20256.00s]  some stuff in the background don't pay attention to me talking so pop pop did I do a full circle
[20256.56s -> 20268.96s]  that was a meditation just what I want you to do is I want you to breathe in through your nose
[20268.96s -> 20276.45s]  and out through your mouth we'll do it at the same time you and me ready so here we go it's in

[20295.55s -> 20302.40s]  direction I'm supposed to be driving for the last five straight minutes I'm telling you the game
[20302.40s -> 20350.66s]  is being created in front of me I somehow made it but we're not watching this hey we get to keep
[20350.66s -> 20368.19s]  going home sweet home I'll just take a quick look around stay in the car and be ready to roll
[20369.92s -> 20379.09s]  that window amically huge is it well it's a big truck never mind officially hit 45 minutes without
[20379.09s -> 20414.32s]  a chapstick why are these cars like weird bugs this camera shake is so it doesn't need to be
[20414.32s -> 20424.19s]  that much they were so afraid of you seeing the outline of the green screen they were terrified
[20424.19s -> 20445.26s]  of it are we still going it's a shooting mission first try if I don't get it first try I'm done

[21475.86s -> 21482.69s]  moment you're laughing at vehicle accidents okay hold on I'll put this one on to see if it we're
[21482.69s -> 21491.79s]  gonna see if it matches okay wait I'm interested in this so keep in mind I I cannot hear it so I
[21491.79s -> 21498.70s]  don't know how much it matches up I cannot hear it this is apparently me laughing at vehicle accidents
[21503.23s -> 21547.92s]  how loud is this though this is gonna be so stupid okay fine okay how's the audio good
[21547.92s -> 21551.22s]  all right let's go let's go let's go let's go
[21577.23s -> 21583.79s]  so if you don't mind how about we mind besides they'll only come after you next

[21607.84s -> 21661.90s]  okay here we go let's go I'm going to get ADHD is it too loud I know it doesn't look like it
[21661.90s -> 21668.16s]  I think it's okay this is a great stream germa yeah you meant that as an insult I think but I
[21668.16s -> 21718.51s]  think it's fun all right let's go let's go let's go let's go I'm putting a stop to this right now
[21719.15s -> 21733.97s]  I'm putting a stop to this right now I somebody said to put slime videos like the people who
[21733.97s -> 21743.30s]  they play with this you know what I'm gonna tell you guys something because I think have I
[21743.30s -> 21748.42s]  talked about this before I don't care about leaking shit because who cares I'm definitely
[21748.42s -> 21753.78s]  not gonna do it at this point but maybe maybe somebody will maybe someone will did I talk about
[21755.60s -> 21766.46s]  spending like years straight making children's videos for YouTube and don't tell anyone and just
[21766.46s -> 21770.86s]  see how long it takes for people to figure it out I did I've talked about that right
[21772.90s -> 21779.84s]  a long time ago I wanted to do like double time streaming this is the part with maybe like four
[21779.84s -> 21784.80s]  or five years ago I wanted to stream and have a different YouTube channel where I just made
[21785.44s -> 21793.74s]  children's videos as a different person and still stream the same amount of time that I do
[21793.74s -> 21799.36s]  but have this like kids kind of content where I was doing like all kinds of like wacky stuff
[21799.36s -> 21805.62s]  it's like oh mr goofball and make hundreds of videos hundreds of them hundreds of them
[21806.34s -> 21812.56s]  and see how long it took before people figured it out because you know that if I did this for
[21812.56s -> 21823.98s]  like two or three years and eventually everybody found it it would be like what what are you doing
[21823.98s -> 21828.38s]  you mean to tell me that there is it there are there are years worth of children's videos that
[21828.38s -> 21833.66s]  you've made high production value by the way not dog shit not just like five seconds we're talking
[21833.66s -> 21841.57s]  like 10 to 15 minute long real educational shit and there would be like five or six hundred videos
[21841.57s -> 21850.06s]  over the course of five years I wanted to do it so bad but it was just too much work it's okay don't
[21850.06s -> 21857.28s]  worry yeah why children's videos I don't know because like I had this thing in my brain where
[21857.28s -> 21863.52s]  like I was gonna see if I could hit a billion views on that channel before before like germa
[21863.52s -> 21869.57s]  985 hit like I don't know like a certain amount of subs or something I was gonna play this internal
[21869.57s -> 21876.86s]  game with myself see if I could hit like a billion views that with like children's videos
[21876.86s -> 21891.46s]  see if I could like overtake the other channel why not elderly videos what what do you mean yeah
[21891.46s -> 21897.68s]  why well that's a good question to ask yourself a bill yeah I was thinking I could get like a
[21897.68s -> 21907.97s]  billion views a billion of them a billion views a billion of those views how many views are on the
[21907.97s -> 21911.33s]  regular channel how many views are on the regular channel like just like the germa 95 youtube
[21911.41s -> 21921.31s]  channel 500 million 300 million I could have gotten to a billion views a billion
[21921.31s -> 21945.87s]  let's say this two or three forms 250 million I could have done it dude you've gone completely
[21945.87s -> 21952.38s]  off the deep end I would you know what I would have real no wouldn't have been slime videos
[21952.38s -> 21956.30s]  it wouldn't have been slime videos it would have been like high quality children's entertainment
[21956.30s -> 21961.90s]  I would have made sure that it was like the best videos I was gonna make like characters and
[21963.04s -> 21967.44s]  and like puppets and shit like it was gonna be awesome it was gonna be truly fun
[21968.85s -> 21974.69s]  dinosaur videos you oh yeah animated stuff I was gonna really go all into it I was gonna go all
[21974.69s -> 21996.72s]  up the channel has 224 million views the auto show that's exactly what I mean auto show would
[21996.72s -> 22008.02s]  have been perfect I would have done the voice and everything too aren't you already making
[22008.02s -> 22025.42s]  videos for children no no no that's not true actually second germa has 245 million
[22026.06s -> 22045.33s]  so I got about half a billion views across the two youtube channels what just happened why is
[22045.33s -> 22063.09s]  this helicopter in such a weird spot I lost all right that's it I'm done I think it would have
[22063.09s -> 22077.66s]  been fun yeah I think it's a good place to call it I'm hungry I'm getting hungry well I apologize
[22077.66s -> 22081.34s]  to the 2000 people that left when I screamed the pallbearer thing hopefully you don't hate me
[22081.34s -> 22092.08s]  forever do a children's show stream I mean there's yeah I trust me I've thought about it where the
[22092.08s -> 22102.24s]  stream just turns on and it's just a it's just like a sesame street show and it's not I don't
[22102.24s -> 22106.32s]  we don't talk about just like yeah of course of course I'm gonna do like a children's entertainment
[22106.32s -> 22117.87s]  stream and it wouldn't be funny it's not gonna be funny like oh is what a funny no no no no
[22117.87s -> 22125.02s]  excuse me this is gonna be quality a quality children's entertainment stream I'm gonna I'm
[22125.02s -> 22150.32s]  writing it down I'm writing it down all right then you're so weird man well you should kind of like
[22150.32s -> 22158.83s]  the muppets I wonder okay what what if it's really fun though hey can you talk in the background for
[22158.83s -> 22166.83s]  a little while while I play some shit yeah sure five minutes that would be cool if it's not terrible
[22169.95s -> 22184.80s]  god damn it I see a bunch of like puppets and stuff me interacting with them and like don't
[22184.80s -> 22203.34s]  eat that many cookies when's the next breath of the wild stream I'm begging you um I don't probably
[22203.34s -> 22210.27s]  soon and there's gonna be a lot of chill streams this year too I think I told we I talked about it
[22210.27s -> 22218.00s]  already but maybe there'll be some maybe there'll be some children's entertainment streams along
[22218.00s -> 22221.84s]  with like just chilling out playing games I'm gonna play breath of the wild I promise but
[22221.84s -> 22229.06s]  I can do some chill streams all right uh I'll see you guys later I'll see you guys actually
[22229.06s -> 22237.95s]  there's a big thing coming up here uh this weekend Elden Ring co-op mod with stir with
[22237.95s -> 22247.17s]  randomizer turned on uh it's gonna be probably pretty cool I'm looking forward to it seems like
[22247.17s -> 22252.64s]  a pretty simple thing we're gonna test it a little bit so that's Saturday we'll see you Saturday uh
[22252.64s -> 22258.93s]  I think we're starting at two so 2 p.m pacific what is randomizer it is every single enemy and
[22258.93s -> 22264.22s]  every single item could be wrong but it's every enemy in the game is completely randomized it
[22264.22s -> 22270.21s]  could be a boss or it could just be like a rat you can walk out the front door and one of the
[22270.21s -> 22278.59s]  dragons just might be there just out out the front door good luck yeah that was some more xbox there
[22278.59s -> 22286.50s]  is a lot more ps1 ps2 and xbox but I don't want to sensory overload I feel a little sensory
[22286.50s -> 22291.95s]  overloaded right now uh I'm gonna get some food I'm gonna relax and I'll see you guys on Saturday
[22291.95s -> 22297.49s]  for Elden Ring we'll put it away for a little bit hope you guys had fun with these streams they're
[22297.49s -> 22304.99s]  always really fun for me to do hopefully they're fun for you to watch so maybe we'll see you again
[22304.99s -> 22326.85s]  let's uh say our goodbyes oh okay there were some really good ones I feel like the xbox has had some
[22328.48s -> 22335.49s]  real quality stuff I mean Indiana Jones was Aragon was well that one was cool what else was there
[22335.49s -> 22340.75s]  Maximum Chase remember that one that was pretty fun Circus Maximus might be my favorite game of
[22340.75s -> 22356.82s]  the night you're allergic to jet set radio I played it for Dreamcast a couple of years ago
