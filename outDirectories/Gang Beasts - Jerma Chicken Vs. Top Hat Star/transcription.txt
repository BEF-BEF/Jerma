[5.11s -> 11.53s]  Hey, hey, welcome to Gang Beasts, where you punch each other in the fucking face.
[11.53s -> 15.56s]  This is stupid.
[15.56s -> 17.56s]  They're kicking the shit out of that dinosaur.
[17.56s -> 19.56s]  Yeah, what's with the dinosaur, everybody?
[24.50s -> 28.50s]  Uh, this game's on Steam right now. It just got into early access.
[28.50s -> 31.50s]  This guy, everyone's already dead. He's still punching.
[31.50s -> 34.64s]  Dude, dude, dude.
[34.64s -> 36.64s]  Alright, so, I'm coming.
[36.64s -> 37.64s]  Don't you dare.
[37.88s -> 38.88s]  I'm gonna come to you.
[38.88s -> 39.88s]  Get out of here.
[39.88s -> 41.88s]  What are you doing? You're supposed to fight me on the trunk.
[41.88s -> 42.88s]  I don't want to fight you on the trunk.
[42.88s -> 44.88s]  Well, that's too bad. I'm coming to you.
[44.88s -> 46.88s]  Get off of this trunk. Get off.
[46.88s -> 48.88s]  No, Juno.
[48.88s -> 50.88s]  You're just tossing you around.
[50.88s -> 52.88s]  I just close-lined you.
[52.88s -> 55.63s]  No!
[55.63s -> 57.63s]  It's not fair. You didn't even knock me off.
[57.63s -> 59.63s]  Oh, you can get hit by the signs. Do you see that?
[59.63s -> 61.63s]  Yes. That's what hit me.
[61.63s -> 63.63s]  Alright, well, alright, you come to me this time.
[63.63s -> 65.63s]  No, I want to wait for the signs.
[65.63s -> 67.63s]  I'm a scary monster.
[68.37s -> 70.37s]  No, no, wait for the signs.
[75.12s -> 76.12s]  Shit.
[76.12s -> 78.12s]  Alright, wait for the signs. Wait for the signs.
[78.12s -> 82.09s]  We will wait for the signs this time.
[82.09s -> 84.09s]  I'm just gonna hang out, like, right on the front of the trunk.
[86.09s -> 88.09s]  Hi.
[91.91s -> 93.91s]  This is so stupid.
[93.91s -> 95.91s]  You do realize one of us is just gonna get...
[95.91s -> 97.91s]  Whoa! No, shit.
[97.91s -> 99.91s]  Wait for the signs.
[100.65s -> 102.65s]  The momentum put me back.
[108.04s -> 110.04s]  Okay, let's get on the same truck.
[110.04s -> 112.22s]  Get on the same truck.
[112.22s -> 114.58s]  And we're waiting for the sign.
[114.58s -> 116.58s]  Don't wiggle around this time, because we're gonna accidentally kill each other.
[116.58s -> 118.58s]  I'm not gonna move.
[118.58s -> 120.58s]  Whoever survives the sign is the true gang beast.
[120.58s -> 122.58s]  Gang beast.
[122.58s -> 125.02s]  Survival of the sign.
[125.02s -> 127.02s]  Oh, here it comes.
[127.02s -> 129.02s]  The road doesn't fork or anything. Where is it telling us to go?
[129.02s -> 131.02s]  We're just gonna get double-closed lined here.
[131.76s -> 133.76s]  Oh my god, you're still alive?
[133.76s -> 135.76s]  Help! Help! Help!
[139.21s -> 141.21s]  I should not have...
[141.21s -> 143.21s]  Oh, he's still alive.
[143.21s -> 145.21s]  Help me up! What the hell?
[145.21s -> 147.21s]  Hold on. I'm gonna get...
[149.21s -> 151.21s]  I love this game. This game is so dumb.
[151.21s -> 153.71s]  Alright, I need to figure...
[153.71s -> 155.71s]  I wanna just figure out how to throw just a punt.
[155.71s -> 157.71s]  No, no, no, no, no! Seriously, seriously.
[157.71s -> 161.80s]  That's how you do it.
[161.80s -> 163.80s]  Oh, okay, there it is. Yeah, it's left bumper.
[164.54s -> 167.68s]  Yeah, left bumper puts out one hand.
[167.68s -> 169.68s]  Riding the Ferris Wheel.
[169.68s -> 172.24s]  Hello? How do I get up?
[172.24s -> 175.25s]  How do I jump off this?
[175.25s -> 177.25s]  My left hand is stuck in the Ferris Wheel.
[179.25s -> 181.25s]  Get me off this ride.
[181.25s -> 183.74s]  I don't wanna be out here anymore.
[183.74s -> 185.74s]  Thank you, you saved me.
[185.74s -> 187.74s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[190.82s -> 192.82s]  Oh dear.
[192.82s -> 194.82s]  You wanna fight with me? Okay.
[194.82s -> 196.82s]  You want a real fighting arena?
[197.56s -> 200.24s]  Come here, you. Come here!
[200.24s -> 202.24s]  Get over here.
[202.24s -> 204.24s]  Something's happening on the screen.
[204.24s -> 206.24s]  You're going... No, no, no!
[206.24s -> 208.24s]  What the hell is going on?
[208.24s -> 210.24s]  I don't know how I did that.
[210.24s -> 212.24s]  I'm just carrying you.
[212.24s -> 214.24s]  No!
[214.24s -> 218.08s]  I just was picking you up.
[218.08s -> 220.08s]  Alright, I guess...
[220.08s -> 222.08s]  Okay, what's why? If you hold down why,
[222.08s -> 224.08s]  you can pick the person up.
[224.08s -> 226.08s]  Come here.
[226.82s -> 228.82s]  Here comes the choke slam.
[234.82s -> 236.82s]  This really is just like a tug of war.
[236.82s -> 238.82s]  No, no, no, no!
[238.82s -> 240.82s]  Get in, get in!
[248.58s -> 250.58s]  I think I'm winning.
[250.58s -> 252.58s]  Why did I lose a point?
[252.58s -> 254.58s]  Because you died too.
[254.58s -> 256.58s]  You're not supposed to die at all.
[256.58s -> 258.95s]  You're gonna get punched in the face.
[259.69s -> 261.69s]  Whoa, okay.
[261.69s -> 263.69s]  I've learned my lesson.
[263.69s -> 265.69s]  You're gonna lose a point?
[265.69s -> 267.69s]  No, I can get out.
[267.69s -> 269.69s]  You still lost a point.
[269.69s -> 271.69s]  Come here.
[271.69s -> 273.69s]  You dragged me by my hair.
[273.69s -> 275.69s]  No, no.
[275.69s -> 277.69s]  Did I go over? You went over.
[277.69s -> 279.69s]  I'm trying to get away. You're done.
[279.69s -> 281.69s]  What the fuck is going on? I fell off the edge of the abyss.
[281.69s -> 283.69s]  Welcome to the abyss, baby.
[283.69s -> 285.69s]  Alright, it's two and two.
[285.69s -> 287.69s]  That was a terrible idea.
[288.43s -> 290.43s]  I'm gonna win right now.
[293.43s -> 295.43s]  Get in!
[295.43s -> 297.43s]  Get in the meat grinder!
[297.43s -> 299.43s]  Get in there!
[299.43s -> 301.43s]  Let go of me!
[301.43s -> 303.43s]  Let go of my hand, you son of a bitch!
[303.43s -> 305.43s]  Let me out!
[305.43s -> 307.43s]  No, no, no.
[307.43s -> 309.43s]  Get back in there!
[309.43s -> 311.43s]  No!
[311.43s -> 313.43s]  You are not getting out!
[313.43s -> 315.43s]  You're coming in too, then!
[315.43s -> 317.80s]  What color are you?
[318.54s -> 320.54s]  I'm still blue top hat, man.
[320.54s -> 323.16s]  I don't think these people are playing.
[323.16s -> 328.41s]  Then throw them off.
[328.41s -> 330.41s]  Come here.
[330.41s -> 332.41s]  You're going out of here.
[332.41s -> 335.74s]  You too!
[335.74s -> 337.74s]  No!
[337.74s -> 339.74s]  You can't just hold on to that, it's cheating!
[339.74s -> 341.74s]  Let go!
[341.74s -> 343.74s]  You let go. I'm not gonna let go, you have to let go.
[343.74s -> 345.74s]  No, you have to let go.
[345.74s -> 348.24s]  Alright, we're both gonna let go at the same time.
[348.24s -> 350.24s]  I actually didn't even mean to let go.
[350.24s -> 352.24s]  Am I pressing a button right now?
[353.34s -> 355.34s]  Holy shit!
[355.34s -> 357.34s]  Yay!
[357.34s -> 359.34s]  Alright, you know the drill. At the very beginning,
[359.34s -> 361.34s]  we dump the other guys off the edge.
[361.34s -> 363.34s]  Yes, because they're absolutely playing this game.
[363.34s -> 365.78s]  Yeah, look at these two guys playing this game.
[365.78s -> 367.78s]  No, I wanna throw them!
[367.78s -> 369.78s]  No, really! Are you serious?
[369.78s -> 371.78s]  We were trying to throw those two off and now we're both...
[371.78s -> 373.78s]  I've got you, I've got you!
[373.78s -> 375.78s]  No, I can't do anything. Can I like, crawl?
[375.78s -> 377.78s]  They're gonna beat us!
[377.78s -> 379.78s]  No, hold on, I'm doing like the crawl.
[379.78s -> 381.78s]  Oh god, I let go.
[382.52s -> 384.52s]  They're just blinking at each other.
[384.52s -> 386.69s]  They're not gonna do anything.
[386.69s -> 389.32s]  This is gonna go on forever.
[389.32s -> 391.32s]  We have to like, end task on the game.
[391.32s -> 393.32s]  Yeah, we have to end task.
[393.32s -> 395.32s]  You have to alt F4, because there's no pause.
[395.32s -> 397.32s]  There's no...
[397.32s -> 399.62s]  It's 6 o'clock, coming down.
[399.62s -> 401.62s]  We've got a train coming, and it's gonna take you
[401.62s -> 403.62s]  to Boylston.
[403.62s -> 405.62s]  And now you wanna get on that train.
[405.62s -> 407.62s]  You wanna make sure you...
[407.62s -> 409.62s]  Wow, I thought it was coming.
[409.62s -> 411.62s]  You need to help me out.
[412.36s -> 414.79s]  I don't wanna get hit by this train.
[414.79s -> 416.79s]  Can you like, reach your hands out and pull me up?
[416.79s -> 418.79s]  Pull me up!
[418.79s -> 420.79s]  Yes!
[420.79s -> 423.29s]  That's awesome!
[423.29s -> 426.55s]  Oh no!
[426.55s -> 428.55s]  I'll come save you!
[428.55s -> 430.55s]  I'll come save you!
[430.55s -> 432.55s]  Once you see the lights on the train,
[432.55s -> 434.55s]  that is when we have to try to escape, okay?
[434.55s -> 436.55s]  Okay, I'm ready.
[436.55s -> 438.55s]  We have to stand back here.
[438.55s -> 440.92s]  You have to run for it.
[440.92s -> 442.92s]  Once the train comes, once you see the lights,
[443.66s -> 445.84s]  we have to make our way back up to the platform.
[445.84s -> 447.84s]  And whoever makes it up there wins.
