[0.89s -> 23.18s]  I actually can't even tell I'm hitting them. I guess I'm hitting them. I missed.
[23.18s -> 33.70s]  This is hard to do. Is there like an aim down sights? Who's saying that? No, that's me saying
[33.70s -> 47.74s]  that. Am I out of bullets? What's going on here? Something going on in the saloon? Everybody calm
[47.74s -> 52.70s]  down for a second. Let me get in there. I'm the sheriff around here. What's happening in this bar?
[53.66s -> 63.86s]  It's a stick up. I'll take care of this. All right. Shh. Shh. Don't say anything. Barkeep.
[63.86s -> 73.25s]  There's no telling what this crazy maniac will do. I got him. There you go. Yeah, you're safe now.
[74.91s -> 82.96s]  Don't act like I never did anything for you. Yeah, look who I got guys. Look what I did.
[83.76s -> 93.34s]  I rescued the town. I rescued everybody. What do you know? Don't put them. No, shit.
[98.45s -> 109.38s]  Now everybody freaks out. What does he want me to do? What am I doing? Am I holding a piece of bread?
[110.10s -> 117.62s]  What am I supposed to do with this guy? Do I just blow love potion in his face?
[119.74s -> 122.62s]  You stay down here. I'm going to take care of these two punks.
[127.89s -> 137.65s]  Who the fuck was that? Who was that? Why would you run out? I thought that was another bad guy.
[139.76s -> 144.08s]  You keep quiet. You keep quiet. I'm just going in here to take a look at the prisoner.
[144.08s -> 155.34s]  Fucking old man. Eat shit. Where is he? Where's that prisoner? There he is. There's that scumbag.
[155.34s -> 162.24s]  Consider it done. Consider it done. Put this motherfucker in a cell.
[162.88s -> 170.90s]  Got to make sure I get my story straight for when he wakes up. Sheriff, thank God you're awake.
[170.90s -> 178.66s]  Those bandits beat both of our asses and locked us in these cells. It's terrible. Sounds like trouble.
[178.66s -> 182.51s]  They could be east of the Mississippi right now, Sheriff. I'll help you solve this mystery,
[182.51s -> 204.38s]  whatever it takes. Sheriff, where's the sheriff? What? He ran out and went to the bar? This guy
[204.38s -> 213.55s]  was just unconscious. He woke up in a cell and that's the first thing he does. He's taking a piss
[213.55s -> 229.70s]  over here. Very surprised nobody can see me right now. This guy's talking to me. I just had a
[229.70s -> 235.41s]  conversation with that guy and he doesn't know I'm here. Be quiet. I heard something. Do I have to?
[235.41s -> 240.37s]  Be quiet. I heard something. Yeah, it was me you heard.
[245.89s -> 253.14s]  I'm just going to be honest. I can't even make rhyme or reason to anything that's on that mini
[253.14s -> 259.04s]  map. I have no idea what any of that means. I don't even know what direction I'm facing.
[262.38s -> 282.90s]  Snipe somebody here. Gonna find my target. What the fuck? Why would you ride the horse around to get
[282.90s -> 292.19s]  off on the same place you got on? He went like a total of 19 feet on that horse. I have to hit
[292.19s -> 296.67s]  somebody right in the head when they're on it moving erratically. Just like the ducks at the
[296.67s -> 306.14s]  old Midway game that go back and forth. This is going to be impossible. Here we go. God damn it.
[306.86s -> 320.29s]  Say cheese. I got him. Madam, I will have to ask you to follow me. Okay. What do you want?
[321.09s -> 333.74s]  What do you want us to do? I'm here to follow you. That's what you wanted? That's what you wanted to
[333.74s -> 342.75s]  tell me? This guy's annoying. How close can I get to these guys without them shooting me?
[345.04s -> 349.76s]  You know you can shoot at me. You don't have to keep creeping. You know you can shoot me.
[351.84s -> 358.00s]  I did. I already did this. I already did. This just happened in the last video I made. More
[358.00s -> 364.19s]  idiots that don't understand dynamite and don't care that I exist. I can't tell if this guy is
[364.19s -> 370.46s]  sleeping like this or if he's tied up or something, but regardless he's getting punched in the fucking
[370.46s -> 378.37s]  face. I'm not touching the keyboard. My hands are in the air guys. I swear to God. He's doing
[378.37s -> 392.00s]  this all by himself. There's nobody. Hold on a second. Hold on just one second.
[398.61s -> 406.38s]  Will the same thing happen if I stab him? Here we go. I'm going to stab this guy into a portal
[406.38s -> 422.66s]  in an invisible wall and it's going to kill him. Well boys, looks like this is the end of the road.
[423.62s -> 430.18s]  Nowhere to go. Nowhere to hide. Unless somebody has a foolproof strategy. Speak now or forever
[430.18s -> 444.48s]  hold your peace. I got a strategy. All right it worked. I'll go get the horses. I think they're
[444.48s -> 458.80s]  tied up back. Guys you can put your hands down now. What on earth? What am I doing with this guy?
[461.02s -> 468.72s]  Why did we turn into a human tumbleweed? This is where I keep the person clothesline.
[469.44s -> 473.26s]  No you just, I can't trust the driver anymore. You know just you don't get a good clean dry.
[473.90s -> 480.02s]  Do it the old-fashioned way. That's what I say. It's almost like they're doing their best gorilla
[480.02s -> 485.34s]  impression. All we need are monkey noises and these guys would make sense.
