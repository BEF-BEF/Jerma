[31.67s -> 38.73s]  Hello, I'm here. Sorry, I had to take a very, very important phone call.
[41.35s -> 46.86s]  Hey, pizza in 30 minutes or less or it's free. Here I am.
[47.50s -> 52.10s]  I already said it in chat and I thought it was funny.
[53.93s -> 62.84s]  No, what's up? Yeah, 30 minutes or less. And that's when I got here.
[69.38s -> 70.98s]  Did you encourage the Cowardly Dog? Nah.
[84.17s -> 85.13s]  No, but what's up? How you doing?
[85.77s -> 89.11s]  Gonna be hanging out, chilling out again tonight.
[89.93s -> 91.13s]  Playing some more Pizza Tower.
[91.77s -> 99.59s]  I'm very well rested. Got a nice tea here. I had dinner already.
[100.39s -> 112.44s]  So I'm good to go. After this, I don't think this is going to take that much.
[112.44s -> 115.72s]  I mean, it probably is. What would you say? I'm probably halfway through the game.
[116.44s -> 121.30s]  Maybe 50, 60% of through the game. Probably like another three or four hours maybe.
[121.30s -> 122.10s]  We'll see. I don't know.
[122.90s -> 128.92s]  But after this, the idea is whether it's today or at some point next week,
[128.92s -> 136.44s]  because after this stream, you are not going to see me for probably about five days or so.
[137.24s -> 142.78s]  Four or five days at least. Big, big Grotto Beast stuff coming.
[142.78s -> 147.88s]  News. That's the intention.
[153.56s -> 154.92s]  And I am a day early.
[155.56s -> 157.48s]  And I'm going to tell you what's going to happen to the sus,
[157.48s -> 161.58s]  because the sus at this point is kind of a weird spot.
[162.68s -> 165.32s]  So the sus, which is when you come to the stream and you're in the chat,
[165.32s -> 167.00s]  you type in, hey, exclamation point, sus.
[167.00s -> 168.60s]  It tells you when the next stream is going to be.
[170.06s -> 171.58s]  It has never been accurate.
[172.68s -> 177.16s]  And in previous years, I have always come into the chat
[177.16s -> 180.36s]  and said, hey, guys, I'm going to stream.
[180.36s -> 182.52s]  I'm not streaming tomorrow. I'm going to stream two days from now.
[183.16s -> 190.47s]  There was always a window of the, it was scheduled and I would always delay it by a day.
[190.47s -> 194.15s]  It would happen 50% of the time. I'd say 40% of the time, at least.
[195.82s -> 198.46s]  This year, we have a different problem.
[199.50s -> 204.22s]  This year, instead of delaying the stream, I pull it forward a day.
[204.22s -> 205.34s]  It happens almost every time.
[205.98s -> 208.06s]  So I do all these reverse delays now.
[208.06s -> 209.10s]  That's the problem this year.
[209.82s -> 214.07s]  Oh, well, problems. I mean, yeah, it's not a real, it's not a problem, but you know.
[214.71s -> 217.77s]  So what's probably going to happen to the sus
[218.41s -> 224.57s]  is the sus is going to tell you when a stream is absolutely not going to happen.
[225.13s -> 231.46s]  So for instance, if you do the sus today, after tonight, tomorrow,
[231.46s -> 233.30s]  it's going to say, hey, you cast sus.
[233.94s -> 236.26s]  He ain't going to be here for fucking four days.
[236.26s -> 239.38s]  And it is when I know I won't be here for at least a few days
[239.38s -> 241.14s]  or when I know I will not be streaming.
[243.05s -> 246.73s]  So the sus is now going to be not when the stream will be
[247.37s -> 249.45s]  but when the stream will not be.
[250.09s -> 250.97s]  Isn't that interesting?
[251.53s -> 252.74s]  I think I like that.
[256.04s -> 257.00s]  You cast sus.
[257.00s -> 261.08s]  You sense a stream not happening for the next three days.
[264.17s -> 265.61s]  The anti-sus.
[265.61s -> 269.88s]  Yeah, we have we're going to the sus is going to go through its evil arc.
[273.35s -> 274.31s]  Very confusing.
[280.30s -> 288.10s]  The evil sus is anti-sus or maybe I just maybe sus is just a general.
[288.10s -> 291.06s]  Hey, yeah, I'm actually I'm planning on streaming a few times this week.
[291.06s -> 293.37s]  Just you'll get notified.
[294.17s -> 295.53s]  Maybe that's the plan.
[296.25s -> 301.77s]  But I definitely I'm starting to see the issue of instead of delaying every time.
[301.77s -> 303.69s]  Now I'm pulling it forward a day every time.
[304.89s -> 312.55s]  So whatever and I'll be honest, the sus has always kind of been there to keep me honest.
[313.85s -> 317.93s]  Because if I know that the sus is telling people there's a stream like in a day or so,
[319.58s -> 323.26s]  I'm I'm it was like, oh, yeah, I'm going to be here in the next day or two.
[324.38s -> 327.82s]  If there's no schedule, then you might I might run into a problem where it's like,
[327.82s -> 331.18s]  hey, there's no schedule and I'm fucking streaming tomorrow.
[331.18s -> 333.42s]  I'm streaming Tuesday and I'm streaming Wednesday.
[333.42s -> 333.74s]  You know what?
[333.74s -> 334.06s]  Fuck it.
[335.10s -> 335.98s]  Why stream again?
[339.51s -> 341.83s]  It's been been a way to keep myself honest in a way,
[342.55s -> 346.50s]  but we'll see.
[346.50s -> 347.86s]  I've been streaming a lot more this year.
[348.58s -> 349.54s]  That's not the point.
[349.54s -> 350.66s]  The point is not to stream more.
[350.66s -> 352.58s]  It's just a stream kind of whenever I feel like it.
[352.58s -> 354.10s]  And I feel like it right now.
[354.10s -> 355.38s]  So you cast sus.
[355.38s -> 357.86s]  You sense the next stream is whenever this weirdo feels like it.
[358.50s -> 360.33s]  How's that sound?
[360.33s -> 360.81s]  Is that good?
[361.53s -> 369.32s]  Oh, I didn't tweet.
[369.32s -> 375.02s]  Oh, but after this, after we play Pete's Tower, the plan is to play
[376.14s -> 378.79s]  Hilux and looking forward to that.
[383.29s -> 384.17s]  We did.
[384.17s -> 385.85s]  I'm going to.
[385.85s -> 400.49s]  There we go.
[400.49s -> 409.93s]  OK, what's a good a good tweet about my throat is so fucked up.
[409.93s -> 410.41s]  What's going on?
[411.29s -> 414.17s]  Pizza Tower part two.
[418.97s -> 419.77s]  That's what's happening.
[433.06s -> 434.10s]  OK, there we go.
[434.98s -> 437.45s]  It's going to hit your feed in a second.
[440.47s -> 442.01s]  Hey, look at that.
[442.01s -> 442.49s]  There it is.
[443.21s -> 445.21s]  You need to watch part one to understand part two.
[446.01s -> 447.05s]  I can give you a quick rundown.
[452.34s -> 456.34s]  I'm just going to run into walls and make frustrated grunts.
[457.14s -> 459.30s]  That's kind of what happened yesterday.
[459.30s -> 462.50s]  So it's pretty much going to be the same stream, just different levels.
[466.04s -> 468.76s]  Well, actually, you probably should understand part one.
[468.76s -> 469.24s]  Let me help you.
[469.24s -> 471.88s]  So let me give you a quick recap of part one.
[476.18s -> 480.90s]  No, and that's pretty much it.
[481.46s -> 483.90s]  Let's see if we see it part two.
[484.62s -> 490.52s]  Here we go.
[490.52s -> 494.36s]  You can play VR again.
[495.72s -> 496.76s]  I don't know.
[496.76s -> 497.80s]  I think VR might.
[498.84s -> 501.40s]  I'm going to have to set up like a seated VR scenario
[502.04s -> 505.66s]  just because of the every time I do VR,
[505.66s -> 509.26s]  it just kind of kills me for four or five days straight.
[511.21s -> 512.57s]  It's happened pretty much every single time.
[513.21s -> 516.57s]  As much as I would love to do it all the time,
[516.57s -> 518.57s]  because it's so fun and just so interesting
[518.57s -> 520.65s]  and there's always such funny, cool shit to do with it.
[522.76s -> 526.76s]  Probably I'd have to figure out to get it in a different spot or something.
[527.48s -> 528.78s]  All right, let me go.
[528.78s -> 529.18s]  I did.
[529.18s -> 533.34s]  If you actually do want an actual recap, I did the first three floors.
[533.90s -> 535.02s]  There are five floors.
[537.18s -> 537.82s]  And where is the?
[539.83s -> 544.46s]  I guess I didn't 100 percent, but I'm not going to do that though.
[544.46s -> 547.90s]  Did you go to the beach?
[550.41s -> 551.69s]  No, I think the beach.
[552.57s -> 560.41s]  Can I use the same elevator to go?
[560.41s -> 561.53s]  Oh, no, it's different elevator.
[562.09s -> 569.90s]  Where's the other elevators?
[570.54s -> 577.62s]  Did I do all?
[577.62s -> 578.18s]  No, I did.
[578.18s -> 579.46s]  I didn't complete this, did I?
[580.62s -> 581.42s]  I did this one.
[582.14s -> 586.38s]  Did I do all the levels down here?
[586.38s -> 587.10s]  This is one of the.
[587.10s -> 588.06s]  Oh, that's a seat.
[588.06s -> 589.10s]  No, we're getting better than that.
[589.66s -> 592.55s]  What level is this?
[592.55s -> 594.15s]  Yeah, this is the last thing I did.
[594.15s -> 594.95s]  I'm getting better than the seat.
[594.95s -> 604.34s]  Fuck this.
[604.34s -> 605.62s]  I should maybe I should warm up first.
[615.46s -> 621.51s]  Yeah, I got to get at least to be.
[635.24s -> 642.02s]  Oh, I got stuck.
[642.66s -> 644.50s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[644.50s -> 645.30s]  Restart, restart, restart.
[645.30s -> 645.78s]  I got stuck.
[646.42s -> 647.30s]  I wanted to jump and I didn't.
[648.02s -> 658.46s]  That was just bad RNG.
[659.02s -> 665.38s]  I was just seeing if I could throw them.
[665.38s -> 675.64s]  I want to see if I could throw them, but I'm testing the game design.
[690.68s -> 692.84s]  I'll get game design handy, game design handy.
[709.83s -> 710.23s]  Let's see.
[710.23s -> 713.03s]  That's what's called pivoting in the middle of a decision.
[713.83s -> 714.79s]  I want everyone to see that.
[714.79s -> 716.87s]  You see my immediate problem solving.
[716.87s -> 717.35s]  Fuck you.
[719.51s -> 720.23s]  I got to shut up.
[725.14s -> 725.38s]  All right.
[725.38s -> 725.86s]  I got hit.
[726.42s -> 737.35s]  I'm ready for God.
[737.35s -> 737.91s]  This is fake.
[743.08s -> 743.32s]  What?
[743.96s -> 746.54s]  How big is that explosion?
[748.62s -> 749.74s]  Oh, this is huge.
[749.74s -> 750.06s]  All right.
[750.06s -> 751.50s]  I'm just trying to see what the game design is.
[756.12s -> 756.84s]  This one's fake.
[760.74s -> 771.61s]  I come on, man.
[777.66s -> 778.46s]  Come on, man.
[779.58s -> 782.20s]  I was just testing.
[782.76s -> 790.07s]  It was just test.
[790.07s -> 792.34s]  I was going to see like how the controls work.
[793.06s -> 812.60s]  Play tester.
[820.52s -> 822.36s]  I want to restart so bad, but I'm not going to.
[825.59s -> 826.31s]  That was bullshit.
[826.87s -> 828.34s]  Turn up the music.
[829.38s -> 831.38s]  I will after I play test for a few minutes.
[832.02s -> 841.69s]  I got to stop running, but the whole game trains you
[841.69s -> 843.29s]  to hold right trigger the whole game.
[844.09s -> 856.01s]  Whatever.
[856.01s -> 856.81s]  I'm sticking to it.
[857.37s -> 864.57s]  Oh my God.
[864.57s -> 865.45s]  Why did I look at chat?
[865.45s -> 867.45s]  And this is like, okay, if I restart, if I restart again,
[867.45s -> 872.87s]  I will stop streaming.
[872.87s -> 873.67s]  No restarts.
[908.28s -> 908.92s]  I forgot he.
[927.74s -> 929.02s]  Oh, I did the same thing.
[929.98s -> 939.18s]  Parry that.
[939.74s -> 942.18s]  It's hard.
[942.18s -> 944.42s]  Dude, this is one of those cocaine games.
[944.42s -> 944.74s]  All right.
[944.74s -> 947.06s]  That's what I'm going to say.
[947.06s -> 947.30s]  All right.
[947.30s -> 947.70s]  It's quiet.
[955.22s -> 959.22s]  This is what I, this is what I feel like cocaine is like
[959.22s -> 959.94s]  is this whole game.
[961.21s -> 985.62s]  Just like, got it.
[1002.10s -> 1002.34s]  All right.
[1002.34s -> 1003.70s]  That's got to be at least a B, right?
[1003.70s -> 1007.40s]  All right.
[1007.40s -> 1009.48s]  So this is what I think cocaine is like.
[1010.12s -> 1011.85s]  I've never done cocaine.
[1011.85s -> 1016.30s]  I have no fucking plans to either.
[1029.82s -> 1031.82s]  Hey, I'll take a B.
[1031.82s -> 1047.50s]  I'm way happier with that.
[1047.50s -> 1048.86s]  I'll take a B. B is fine.
[1048.86s -> 1054.06s]  I don't think I did all the other missions here.
[1054.06s -> 1054.78s]  Did I?
[1054.78s -> 1059.62s]  I did mini golf, which I got an A, excuse me.
[1059.62s -> 1068.60s]  It's a space level.
[1069.16s -> 1074.81s]  There is a space level.
[1075.53s -> 1077.05s]  There's also, oh, I didn't do it.
[1077.05s -> 1077.93s]  Almost everything here.
[1077.93s -> 1078.43s]  Okay.
[1078.97s -> 1084.39s]  You know what else I need to do?
[1085.03s -> 1088.68s]  I need to really slow down in the first part.
[1089.40s -> 1091.88s]  In part one, I still have that mindset where it's like,
[1091.88s -> 1094.28s]  I have to go as fast as I humanly can, right?
[1095.40s -> 1096.28s]  Which is inaccurate.
[1097.08s -> 1104.38s]  Okay.
[1104.38s -> 1105.42s]  Let's do this one.
[1105.42s -> 1106.66s]  What up?
[1106.66s -> 1107.46s]  Make it a little louder.
[1108.26s -> 1110.58s]  How's that?
[1110.66s -> 1111.16s]  Better.
[1115.66s -> 1115.90s]  All right.
[1115.90s -> 1117.42s]  So don't go fast.
[1117.42s -> 1118.46s]  Just chill.
[1118.46s -> 1119.58s]  It's not a big deal.
[1119.58s -> 1120.54s]  Just relax.
[1120.54s -> 1131.54s]  It's all about combos.
[1132.42s -> 1138.46s]  This song's great.
[1147.64s -> 1148.60s]  In the box or up here?
[1148.60s -> 1150.20s]  Okay, up here.
[1150.20s -> 1154.90s]  Oh, I don't know.
[1154.90s -> 1158.18s]  This might have best soundtrack 2023.
[1159.54s -> 1162.02s]  I mean, it's we're only two months into the year,
[1162.02s -> 1164.42s]  but I don't think I've heard anything since.
[1165.99s -> 1167.83s]  Even well into 2022.
[1168.55s -> 1170.38s]  Okay, this is amazing.
[1170.38s -> 1171.18s]  This is really, really great.
[1171.98s -> 1179.83s]  What about this?
[1182.54s -> 1183.45s]  Interesting.
[1185.61s -> 1194.25s]  How'd you get up there?
[1203.02s -> 1203.66s]  Bell up there.
[1204.38s -> 1208.33s]  The blue is part of the environment, or are they?
[1208.33s -> 1208.97s]  They're just there.
[1210.95s -> 1220.46s]  Actually, let's do that.
[1220.46s -> 1222.18s]  Is this hurting me?
[1240.98s -> 1241.70s]  Stop.
[1241.70s -> 1245.91s]  Stop.
[1245.91s -> 1251.27s]  Who's this insane guy in the top right?
[1251.27s -> 1251.96s]  Come on.
[1251.96s -> 1252.76s]  That's Pepino.
[1253.40s -> 1266.66s]  I want to go down there.
[1274.49s -> 1280.14s]  How do I get down there?
[1280.14s -> 1300.89s]  To run faster?
[1320.07s -> 1321.30s]  Why did that hurt?
[1321.30s -> 1335.22s]  Very cool.
[1336.90s -> 1345.69s]  We got a D, so I want to get up to that.
[1346.73s -> 1348.41s]  To the right, probably.
[1348.41s -> 1359.78s]  What cartoon does this remind you of?
[1359.78s -> 1361.54s]  You know, it's funny you say that
[1361.54s -> 1367.13s]  because it's this weird non-descript cartoon.
[1368.25s -> 1372.90s]  It's a style from, it's like Rocko.
[1372.90s -> 1374.10s]  Yeah, Rocko's Modern Life.
[1375.70s -> 1381.00s]  It's got this weird like 90s,
[1381.96s -> 1384.04s]  late 90s, mid 90s kind of vibe.
[1384.76s -> 1385.56s]  Cow and Chicken.
[1385.56s -> 1386.92s]  Yep, that's another one.
[1386.92s -> 1388.76s]  Early like Cartoon Network kind of stuff.
[1390.92s -> 1391.96s]  Courage Cowardly Dog.
[1393.08s -> 1393.64s]  Yeah, for sure.
[1411.05s -> 1411.77s]  Go backwards.
[1412.41s -> 1416.14s]  There we go.
[1423.46s -> 1426.57s]  I got to go up here.
[1427.85s -> 1428.81s]  Can I make it over there?
[1429.77s -> 1431.14s]  I don't know.
[1431.14s -> 1431.54s]  Yeah, I can.
[1431.54s -> 1459.32s]  Whoa, come on, give me that pocket.
[1459.96s -> 1465.27s]  What level is this?
[1465.99s -> 1469.32s]  Um, I don't know.
[1469.32s -> 1483.90s]  Come on.
[1483.90s -> 1485.10s]  Frost Cove.
[1485.10s -> 1489.78s]  Secret.
[1504.90s -> 1515.51s]  What does he say sometimes?
[1515.51s -> 1516.71s]  He goes like, it's a goal.
[1527.54s -> 1528.18s]  Very nice.
[1531.85s -> 1533.61s]  Paranoid is what he's saying.
[1533.61s -> 1535.21s]  He goes paranoid.
[1535.21s -> 1535.77s]  Is that what it is?
[1536.49s -> 1554.96s]  Pizza.
[1556.70s -> 1557.66s]  Pizza.
[1557.66s -> 1558.22s]  Pizza.
[1558.22s -> 1558.78s]  Pizza.
[1558.78s -> 1559.28s]  Pizza.
[1559.74s -> 1560.38s]  Pizza.
[1560.38s -> 1560.88s]  Pizza.
[1563.67s -> 1564.17s]  Pizza.
[1565.40s -> 1565.90s]  Pizza.
[1566.44s -> 1575.50s]  I think I can get in there.
[1575.50s -> 1588.76s]  I had a bad day today.
[1589.56s -> 1590.89s]  Sorry to hear that.
[1592.87s -> 1593.99s]  No, what the?
[1593.99s -> 1595.11s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1595.11s -> 1596.23s]  I want to go back down.
[1596.23s -> 1599.51s]  Oh, I missed it.
[1600.15s -> 1600.79s]  That's all right.
[1600.79s -> 1611.02s]  No, no, no, it's moving too fast.
[1611.58s -> 1613.18s]  No, I wanted to get that stuff.
[1623.74s -> 1624.70s]  Oh, I can't grab these.
[1625.26s -> 1639.67s]  This level is cool.
[1654.63s -> 1663.18s]  Nice.
[1663.72s -> 1673.19s]  Oh, I have to do it a bunch of times.
[1680.97s -> 1682.41s]  Oh, yeah.
[1683.45s -> 1687.22s]  I got a big combo going.
[1691.90s -> 1700.36s]  No, shit.
[1701.48s -> 1702.20s]  Whatever.
[1702.20s -> 1722.23s]  Oh, my God.
[1722.79s -> 1731.85s]  Sorry.
[1749.53s -> 1750.03s]  Geez.
[1760.60s -> 1762.60s]  I think I might have a secret up there.
[1762.60s -> 1777.02s]  All right, I'm good.
[1777.02s -> 1790.92s]  Anything else in here?
[1795.24s -> 1795.74s]  No, good.
[1796.44s -> 1805.38s]  Nice.
[1805.38s -> 1806.02s]  Very cool.
[1806.02s -> 1807.99s]  That was a fun level.
[1807.99s -> 1813.29s]  That might be one of my favorites, actually.
[1814.01s -> 1827.98s]  That was probably my favorite one.
[1832.95s -> 1835.59s]  I like it when you bust a move like this.
[1835.59s -> 1839.14s]  I like how you can move with this.
[1839.78s -> 1841.48s]  Do you eventually get to do something with this?
[1841.48s -> 1842.76s]  Or is it just a fun little thing to do?
[1843.56s -> 1850.54s]  Just for fun.
[1850.54s -> 1851.02s]  That's cool.
[1860.86s -> 1863.66s]  All right, so there's one more level, which is up.
[1863.66s -> 1868.92s]  Maybe all this whole time.
[1868.92s -> 1869.48s]  I didn't even ask.
[1870.28s -> 1871.75s]  How the fuck you're doing?
[1872.31s -> 1881.21s]  Remember to not take too many breaks.
[1881.21s -> 1881.77s]  Keep playing.
[1881.77s -> 1882.97s]  Your time here is limited.
[1886.18s -> 1886.68s]  Damn.
[1887.22s -> 1891.24s]  Don't take too many breaks.
[1891.24s -> 1910.97s]  Rapino pizza 3000 is going on over here.
[1910.97s -> 1912.17s]  Change direction and jump.
[1912.89s -> 1922.60s]  Oh, well, we're going that way.
[1922.60s -> 1923.80s]  Level lap two.
[1924.52s -> 1928.22s]  The moon smoking?
[1932.90s -> 1933.54s]  Yeah, whatever.
[1945.35s -> 1948.15s]  Wait, can I move up or something?
[1949.74s -> 1950.86s]  Oh, I can do that.
[1952.06s -> 1959.56s]  Sega Genesis.
[1960.71s -> 1961.67s]  Yeah, that's another one, too.
[1962.47s -> 1967.38s]  It definitely feels like an old Genesis game.
[1967.38s -> 1968.74s]  Old Super Nintendo game.
[1980.41s -> 1981.61s]  You mean Sonic?
[1981.61s -> 1985.50s]  Yeah, it doesn't look like Sonic, though.
[1985.50s -> 1987.90s]  Some other games are like Boogerman, somebody said.
[1987.90s -> 1991.02s]  This is looks and feels like Boogerman.
[1991.58s -> 1992.14s]  Pop that.
[1992.14s -> 1992.86s]  I am not going to miss.
[1992.86s -> 1993.42s]  You know what I'm saying?
[1994.46s -> 2006.52s]  Earthworm Jim.
[2006.52s -> 2007.96s]  Yep, exactly.
[2008.76s -> 2017.78s]  It's really cool that there are people still kind of making stuff in that kind of style.
[2018.58s -> 2043.40s]  I can definitely get in there.
[2044.60s -> 2047.99s]  That sound effect is somewhere, too.
[2048.79s -> 2050.04s]  That.
[2051.54s -> 2052.26s]  Just don't know where.
[2052.82s -> 2061.34s]  There's the other side, wasn't it?
[2061.34s -> 2062.06s]  Or maybe it's up.
[2062.70s -> 2064.23s]  Might be up there.
[2065.03s -> 2069.77s]  No, it's probably the left, the other side.
[2072.34s -> 2072.66s]  Damn it.
[2073.22s -> 2082.86s]  Oh, well, I actually don't.
[2083.98s -> 2084.54s]  Can I go down?
[2085.18s -> 2087.98s]  Cannot.
[2087.98s -> 2088.48s]  Okay.
[2089.18s -> 2100.86s]  Not yet.
[2100.86s -> 2102.84s]  Okay.
[2102.84s -> 2113.00s]  Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2113.00s -> 2113.48s]  I can get it now.
[2113.48s -> 2114.12s]  I can get it.
[2114.12s -> 2115.56s]  That's actually a good thing that happened.
[2115.56s -> 2132.86s]  Oh, God.
[2135.34s -> 2137.10s]  No, no, no, no.
[2137.10s -> 2137.74s]  Just fly.
[2137.74s -> 2138.14s]  Everything's fine.
[2140.14s -> 2140.64s]  We're good.
[2141.42s -> 2163.11s]  Hey, welcome to Turbo 985.
[2163.67s -> 2164.57s]  Funny noises.
[2170.84s -> 2171.72s]  I already went in here, right?
[2207.08s -> 2215.26s]  You can only make 114 funny noises this stream from now on.
[2220.84s -> 2221.48s]  Whoopsie.
[2222.12s -> 2223.00s]  113.
[2224.30s -> 2224.94s]  Motherfucker.
[2245.26s -> 2247.34s]  I'll never be able to hear anything else.
[2248.62s -> 2253.72s]  I didn't even make that one.
[2253.72s -> 2255.00s]  Oh, yeah, I kind of did.
[2255.00s -> 2255.40s]  All right.
[2256.12s -> 2263.70s]  Well, I can definitely go up.
[2280.65s -> 2281.29s]  Well, whatever.
[2281.29s -> 2282.09s]  I don't have to get everything.
[2282.81s -> 2287.38s]  I'm just so, I'm just so concerned
[2287.38s -> 2288.74s]  that something's going to be underneath me.
[2289.54s -> 2306.22s]  Really?
[2306.60s -> 2310.01s]  Has to be the other side then, huh?
[2310.81s -> 2325.51s]  How do I, how do I change direction?
[2326.15s -> 2340.82s]  Oh, we have to be on the floor.
[2340.82s -> 2358.92s]  Okay.
[2358.92s -> 2359.72s]  Whoa.
[2359.72s -> 2372.11s]  Jesus.
[2372.57s -> 2376.70s]  Up and up?
[2376.70s -> 2377.20s]  No.
[2378.98s -> 2379.94s]  That sound right there.
[2380.58s -> 2381.08s]  That...
[2382.26s -> 2394.54s]  Sound that goes...
[2397.74s -> 2408.02s]  Where's this person's room?
[2415.40s -> 2416.52s]  Okay.
[2417.06s -> 2421.50s]  Oh, shit.
[2421.50s -> 2422.00s]  Whatever.
[2422.86s -> 2432.88s]  Damn it.
[2434.70s -> 2435.20s]  Damn it.
[2435.90s -> 2456.60s]  Okay.
[2464.84s -> 2468.78s]  I'm going so fast.
[2473.82s -> 2474.30s]  Don't...
[2474.30s -> 2475.66s]  I want to get this in one hit.
[2476.46s -> 2483.16s]  Okay, now...
[2484.52s -> 2485.64s]  Oh, my God.
[2485.64s -> 2487.16s]  I fucking ruined everything.
[2487.16s -> 2505.31s]  Got it.
[2518.18s -> 2519.22s]  Oh, wait.
[2520.10s -> 2520.74s]  But what about...
[2522.10s -> 2523.54s]  So many things to do in each level.
[2527.64s -> 2528.14s]  Shit.
[2528.76s -> 2540.63s]  There's so many cool things to do in each level.
[2540.63s -> 2548.92s]  How loud?
[2548.92s -> 2550.84s]  Do you think the person that screamed that...
[2550.84s -> 2555.30s]  I'm just curious how loud that really was in studio.
[2556.34s -> 2568.16s]  Wait.
[2570.62s -> 2571.66s]  Down here maybe somehow?
[2606.46s -> 2606.96s]  Oh, wait.
[2606.96s -> 2607.58s]  I keep it.
[2607.58s -> 2608.08s]  I keep it.
[2608.94s -> 2611.30s]  I think I'm done with this game.
[2611.30s -> 2614.34s]  I don't play puzzle games, and this is a puzzle part.
[2615.22s -> 2615.86s]  You know how I feel.
[2615.86s -> 2619.30s]  Like, anytime I get to a puzzle section, I just quit it because I don't do that.
[2619.30s -> 2620.50s]  I just don't play games like that.
[2620.50s -> 2621.22s]  I just don't like it.
[2627.94s -> 2628.50s]  Yeah, that's it.
[2628.50s -> 2630.02s]  I just don't play games like this.
[2630.02s -> 2631.30s]  Anytime I'm like, oh, I have to use...
[2631.30s -> 2637.11s]  I have to put this circle into that circle hole and then take that key up.
[2637.11s -> 2637.61s]  No.
[2637.91s -> 2638.55s]  I'm done.
[2638.55s -> 2655.02s]  Hurry.
[2655.02s -> 2655.42s]  Hurry.
[2655.42s -> 2656.30s]  I'm not going fast.
[2670.82s -> 2671.32s]  No.
[2672.18s -> 2682.38s]  I need to get in there.
[2682.38s -> 2685.42s]  I don't even know why, but I just had to.
[2686.14s -> 2694.30s]  What?
[2694.52s -> 2696.60s]  What?
[2696.82s -> 2705.31s]  Hmm.
[2721.13s -> 2722.41s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[2729.54s -> 2730.26s]  Get out of my way.
[2730.26s -> 2730.82s]  Oh, my God.
[2731.94s -> 2732.44s]  What?
[2732.74s -> 2733.30s]  Oh, shit.
[2735.10s -> 2735.74s]  Oh, shit.
[2736.38s -> 2743.46s]  No, stop.
[2744.02s -> 2745.38s]  I'm fucking panicking right now.
[2745.38s -> 2746.66s]  Stop panicking and just play it.
[2746.66s -> 2747.54s]  Come on, dude.
[2747.54s -> 2748.18s]  Oh, my God.
[2748.18s -> 2749.14s]  I'm panicking.
[2749.14s -> 2749.54s]  Stop.
[2749.54s -> 2750.10s]  Just go.
[2750.10s -> 2750.60s]  Just crawl.
[2751.38s -> 2780.71s]  Get the sandwich.
[2780.71s -> 2794.73s]  I want to get the sandwich.
[2794.73s -> 2801.99s]  It's worth money, man.
[2806.18s -> 2806.82s]  Shit.
[2806.82s -> 2807.38s]  What did I miss?
[2808.18s -> 2810.36s]  Not bad.
[2810.36s -> 2811.00s]  Not bad.
[2811.00s -> 2815.85s]  I believe that's the whole floor.
[2816.49s -> 2822.28s]  Can you put this game into food mode?
[2823.62s -> 2824.18s]  No.
[2824.18s -> 2825.46s]  See, this game is not...
[2825.46s -> 2827.70s]  I would never qualify this as a game that could be food mode.
[2828.34s -> 2831.14s]  This is too much to pay attention to.
[2831.86s -> 2834.57s]  Food mode is specifically a game
[2835.21s -> 2837.29s]  where it's pretty slow paced
[2837.29s -> 2840.17s]  and there's a ton of downtime in between each major thing to do.
[2843.30s -> 2843.94s]  You don't...
[2843.94s -> 2846.18s]  I'm not running full sprint like this.
[2846.18s -> 2848.10s]  And then it's like, oh, hey, it's time for dinner.
[2849.46s -> 2851.06s]  No, no, I would just quit the level.
[2851.94s -> 2856.74s]  I don't know if I'd be able to restart it again.
[2857.46s -> 2865.86s]  I think I did pretty damn good on this floor.
[2867.13s -> 2868.89s]  I missed two toppings.
[2869.53s -> 2880.57s]  Can't do better than that.
[2885.98s -> 2940.97s]  There's over here.
[2940.97s -> 2946.23s]  Kind of looks like Super Jail.
[2947.22s -> 2947.86s]  It does.
[2952.33s -> 2954.89s]  You've gone far enough, buddy.
[2954.89s -> 2956.25s]  You need to be this tall.
[2964.78s -> 2968.01s]  This image is so fucked up.
[2968.01s -> 2969.75s]  It's so scary.
[2969.75s -> 2971.43s]  But somehow, that's it.
[2971.43s -> 2971.93s]  That's cool.
[2973.38s -> 2974.58s]  Good show, I say.
[2975.30s -> 2977.85s]  I'm going to move these out of my way.
[2978.65s -> 2980.31s]  I just became...
[2980.31s -> 2981.11s]  Yeah, now.
[2982.07s -> 2983.99s]  You got me now without the arm rests.
[2984.55s -> 2986.87s]  That's how you know everything's going to get fucking crazy now.
[2994.25s -> 2995.37s]  Big city.
[2995.37s -> 3015.82s]  Does your fridge smell weird if you check the expiration date?
[3017.99s -> 3019.70s]  I guess I'm just going to do this one.
[3023.05s -> 3023.85s]  Oh, shit.
[3024.49s -> 3024.73s]  What?
[3024.73s -> 3025.93s]  That's the name of this place?
[3026.65s -> 3031.22s]  This actually says, oh, shit.
[3031.22s -> 3040.44s]  Sewer level.
[3041.24s -> 3042.62s]  Okay.
[3043.26s -> 3048.44s]  Oh, that's kind of gross.
[3049.24s -> 3056.49s]  Stick to the wall and then wall.
[3057.53s -> 3061.37s]  Okay.
[3062.01s -> 3062.41s]  Hold on.
[3063.93s -> 3066.28s]  You're way slower like this, too.
[3067.16s -> 3075.77s]  Shit.
[3075.77s -> 3076.65s]  I want to jump over that.
[3077.29s -> 3082.42s]  Let go.
[3082.42s -> 3083.58s]  Let go.
[3084.22s -> 3086.73s]  Get in there.
[3095.78s -> 3096.98s]  How did I get in there last time?
[3111.94s -> 3112.74s]  Jump.
[3112.74s -> 3116.66s]  What the fuck?
[3116.66s -> 3117.70s]  I thought...
[3118.26s -> 3118.95s]  Okay.
[3118.95s -> 3119.67s]  I thought you had to be...
[3121.75s -> 3125.29s]  I thought you had to be rolling.
[3125.85s -> 3133.06s]  Really?
[3133.06s -> 3135.16s]  Are these supposed to be the Ninja Turtles?
[3148.89s -> 3151.30s]  No.
[3151.86s -> 3155.98s]  Different pipe, though.
[3156.70s -> 3158.97s]  Can I not go on that one?
[3171.32s -> 3177.59s]  I want to break it.
[3194.42s -> 3195.62s]  Like the cat jams.
[3195.94s -> 3200.94s]  I feel like the rat dancing.
[3201.50s -> 3202.54s]  It's so cool.
[3202.54s -> 3203.18s]  So cute.
[3204.14s -> 3205.26s]  It's just so funny.
[3206.30s -> 3226.58s]  So the orange pipes don't seem to do very much, huh?
[3226.58s -> 3230.47s]  Or am I missing something?
[3231.27s -> 3235.70s]  Of course you're the screamer that likes the dancing rat.
[3235.70s -> 3236.66s]  What team are you on?
[3237.64s -> 3239.16s]  I'm on neither one of these teams.
[3239.72s -> 3241.32s]  I just like seeing them both dance.
[3242.12s -> 3243.75s]  I don't think you can be on either one.
[3244.71s -> 3259.82s]  I think there's something back here.
[3260.54s -> 3263.86s]  There was.
[3264.66s -> 3271.51s]  Come over here.
[3271.51s -> 3284.42s]  How do I get in there?
[3284.42s -> 3291.40s]  I want to get in there.
[3304.02s -> 3304.42s]  Geez.
[3327.99s -> 3344.26s]  I thought that was Peter Griffin for a second.
[3344.26s -> 3348.06s]  Just from right here.
[3348.78s -> 3351.02s]  I was like, oh, that's Peter Griffin right there.
[3373.80s -> 3374.92s]  Why would it be Peter Griffin?
[3375.82s -> 3376.22s]  Idiot.
[3378.60s -> 3379.08s]  It's not funny.
[3379.08s -> 3380.04s]  That wasn't Peter Griffin.
[3380.04s -> 3380.52s]  Fucking idiot.
[3381.64s -> 3382.76s]  Stop talking.
[3382.76s -> 3383.48s]  Stop talking.
[3384.12s -> 3389.18s]  Hey, Peter Griffin's in the game.
[3389.18s -> 3389.74s]  Fuck that.
[3389.74s -> 3391.10s]  Stop fucking talking, Jeremy.
[3395.22s -> 3395.46s]  No.
[3396.74s -> 3405.38s]  He's always looking for secrets.
[3405.38s -> 3406.10s]  You know what I mean?
[3406.10s -> 3420.36s]  Turn the music down.
[3422.97s -> 3426.25s]  I think that would be very upset with me if I did.
[3426.25s -> 3426.81s]  Ah, shit.
[3437.59s -> 3440.14s]  Is it more momentum?
[3440.14s -> 3446.46s]  It was more momentum.
[3452.58s -> 3454.58s]  Well, I screwed that one up.
[3455.30s -> 3460.81s]  Actually, maybe I do want to go that way for a second.
[3460.81s -> 3461.05s]  Shit.
[3461.61s -> 3468.92s]  So hold on.
[3468.92s -> 3474.31s]  All right.
[3474.31s -> 3475.83s]  I'm bouncing around all over the place.
[3475.83s -> 3479.03s]  Stop.
[3479.03s -> 3480.07s]  I can't stop moving.
[3480.87s -> 3481.99s]  All right.
[3481.99s -> 3482.79s]  We'll just go this way.
[3483.35s -> 3503.19s]  Blame.
[3503.99s -> 3507.70s]  Well, I definitely want to go that way.
[3523.18s -> 3528.46s]  Are you counting down how many sounds I'm making?
[3529.18s -> 3532.49s]  You are not.
[3532.49s -> 3533.69s]  What happens when we get zero?
[3535.13s -> 3536.25s]  What happens at zero?
[3556.87s -> 3557.35s]  Jeez.
[3557.35s -> 3564.58s]  Ah, damn it.
[3565.14s -> 3573.38s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[3573.38s -> 3573.94s]  Dude, come on.
[3574.50s -> 3583.83s]  I just stopped streaming.
[3586.73s -> 3587.45s]  Sorry, guys.
[3587.45s -> 3588.49s]  That's all for today.
[3589.61s -> 3590.89s]  Well, it's definitely over here.
[3592.20s -> 3592.60s]  Come on.
[3593.32s -> 3611.99s]  Did I not even get the thing I was supposed to get?
[3611.99s -> 3612.95s]  How did I not touch it?
[3613.51s -> 3613.91s]  What?
[3614.79s -> 3619.11s]  I grazed the frame of one little frame above.
[3619.83s -> 3620.95s]  What are you talking about?
[3622.57s -> 3627.27s]  Come on.
[3627.27s -> 3627.75s]  Oh, well.
[3639.37s -> 3640.57s]  I'm getting rhythm.
[3640.57s -> 3641.85s]  There's no rhythm to this right now.
[3657.18s -> 3657.50s]  No.
[3658.46s -> 3661.21s]  Oh, my God.
[3661.21s -> 3661.77s]  What's happening?
[3662.65s -> 3663.93s]  No, I have a second chance.
[3672.87s -> 3673.83s]  What just happened?
[3675.13s -> 3675.61s]  Hurry up.
[3675.61s -> 3676.01s]  I'm going.
[3676.89s -> 3692.54s]  Get away from me.
[3692.54s -> 3692.86s]  Get away.
[3696.58s -> 3713.56s]  Fine.
[3713.56s -> 3714.60s]  Go this way.
[3714.60s -> 3715.83s]  Just kidding.
[3727.85s -> 3728.33s]  Jeez.
[3741.30s -> 3742.82s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3755.00s -> 3755.48s]  What are you doing?
[3775.69s -> 3783.83s]  Oh, go.
[3791.74s -> 3794.15s]  Oh, my goodness.
[3794.15s -> 3794.95s]  You have to hold it first.
[3794.95s -> 3796.31s]  It's like it takes like a second.
[3805.06s -> 3814.09s]  So is there anything else to get?
[3814.73s -> 3815.88s]  That's it.
[3815.88s -> 3826.20s]  It's an A.
[3826.20s -> 3826.76s]  A minus?
[3826.76s -> 3827.48s]  That's not what it says.
[3832.14s -> 3837.82s]  Can you eat a whole pizza on stream?
[3837.82s -> 3838.78s]  Very unhealthy.
[3838.78s -> 3839.18s]  That's it.
[3839.18s -> 3839.98s]  It's probably a bad idea.
[3844.73s -> 3846.09s]  Oh, new costume.
[3847.61s -> 3853.29s]  Killing a thousand enemies in a playthrough.
[3853.29s -> 3854.25s]  I don't think I could do it.
[3856.81s -> 3858.09s]  I don't know why you'd want to do it.
[3859.05s -> 3859.61s]  How about the...
[3860.58s -> 3864.26s]  The too much fat and sauce and shit.
[3864.26s -> 3865.30s]  Like, it's way too much.
[3866.42s -> 3869.45s]  All the calories, all the heaviness on your metabolism.
[3870.25s -> 3870.89s]  Blood sugar.
[3870.89s -> 3872.89s]  Like, something crazy would happen to it.
[3872.89s -> 3873.61s]  No, it's a bad idea.
[3874.41s -> 3878.90s]  Oh, no.
[3879.46s -> 3880.79s]  Snoddy's dead.
[3881.51s -> 3893.34s]  Missing.
[3893.34s -> 3894.22s]  Oh, no.
[3894.22s -> 3897.34s]  Snow level?
[3897.34s -> 3898.22s]  What's up here?
[3898.22s -> 3903.34s]  Probably 300?
[3904.54s -> 3905.10s]  Only 200.
[3905.10s -> 3905.82s]  All right.
[3905.82s -> 3909.66s]  Let's do the snow level.
[3909.66s -> 3914.98s]  You ate a whole pizza on the Sea Man stream.
[3914.98s -> 3916.98s]  Yeah, but that was a small...
[3917.78s -> 3919.62s]  That was a personal pizza.
[3919.62s -> 3920.42s]  I didn't eat the whole thing.
[3920.42s -> 3921.46s]  Did I eat the whole pizza?
[3922.26s -> 3923.70s]  I ate it over the course of a couple of hours.
[3926.34s -> 3927.94s]  Yeah, that was a personal pizza.
[3934.60s -> 3936.04s]  You ate it in five minutes?
[3936.68s -> 3943.37s]  I did not eat it in five.
[3943.37s -> 3945.45s]  You literally ate, cut it into four pieces.
[3945.45s -> 3945.77s]  Yeah.
[3946.41s -> 3947.37s]  But those...
[3947.37s -> 3948.49s]  Yeah, it was a whole pizza.
[3949.21s -> 3949.93s]  But I ate it...
[3951.02s -> 3952.54s]  Also, this is important too.
[3953.34s -> 3954.68s]  That stream was...
[3955.48s -> 3956.36s]  One what?
[3956.36s -> 3957.88s]  Almost 12, 13 hours long?
[3960.07s -> 3960.47s]  You ate...
[3962.50s -> 3965.38s]  It was like an 11 plus hour stream.
[3966.10s -> 3970.84s]  Yeah, that's the only food I ate over the course of almost a whole day.
[3971.48s -> 3978.41s]  And that's really bad to do that.
[3978.41s -> 3982.01s]  But, you know, I was streaming and I was playing Sea Man and that's what happened.
[3982.57s -> 3997.34s]  I'm going way too fast to stop.
[3997.34s -> 3998.62s]  I can't slow down.
[3998.62s -> 4006.42s]  I can't go that way with it.
[4006.42s -> 4011.78s]  What am I doing?
[4012.50s -> 4021.10s]  Shit.
[4021.10s -> 4021.66s]  I can get it.
[4021.66s -> 4022.06s]  Come on.
[4028.02s -> 4029.51s]  There we go.
[4029.51s -> 4041.70s]  I figured it was going to be a secret over there.
[4043.83s -> 4044.31s]  Guess not.
[4044.95s -> 4047.93s]  Hot pepper?
[4048.57s -> 4050.10s]  Ooh, spicy.
[4051.06s -> 4055.46s]  Oh, shit.
[4056.10s -> 4057.06s]  Okay, that's what it wants me to do.
[4058.34s -> 4073.16s]  Did you like the Sea Man stream?
[4073.16s -> 4075.96s]  I think there was a lot of stuff that happened on that stream.
[4075.96s -> 4076.46s]  Yeah.
[4079.75s -> 4081.83s]  Sometimes you have to just finish something.
[4082.63s -> 4083.83s]  Even if it's like, you know what?
[4083.83s -> 4084.79s]  I don't know about this.
[4086.18s -> 4087.78s]  You have to finish it.
[4087.78s -> 4091.62s]  If you know for a fact that I would no chance, no chance,
[4092.58s -> 4095.86s]  would I have actually finished that game on another day.
[4095.86s -> 4097.70s]  You all know that for a fact.
[4098.66s -> 4101.67s]  Can I not bring it over there?
[4102.55s -> 4112.86s]  It's probably a secret over there that I'm not getting over here.
[4122.71s -> 4124.31s]  Can I avoid all this and just jump?
[4124.31s -> 4125.59s]  I can, kind of.
[4130.10s -> 4130.82s]  Really?
[4130.82s -> 4134.01s]  I'll probably be on the way back.
[4134.65s -> 4151.61s]  Damn it.
[4151.61s -> 4161.24s]  Damn it.
[4161.70s -> 4172.81s]  Do you like the pizza tower stream?
[4172.81s -> 4174.09s]  Oh, that pizza tower stream.
[4174.49s -> 4175.78s]  It was insane.
[4175.78s -> 4178.60s]  It was just so wild.
[4178.60s -> 4179.40s]  It's so fucked up.
[4180.36s -> 4187.32s]  The art style was so cool in that game though.
[4188.04s -> 4190.79s]  You ever get like, nostalgia and you just don't,
[4190.79s -> 4192.23s]  you want to play it so bad again.
[4192.23s -> 4194.23s]  Like, you wish you could just go back and just do it everything again.
[4194.79s -> 4197.03s]  I kind of feel that way with the pizza tower stream.
[4197.83s -> 4199.43s]  Because I was having such a good time.
[4199.43s -> 4200.79s]  Just wish I could like, do it again.
[4201.59s -> 4206.10s]  Does that mean?
[4206.10s -> 4208.44s]  Jesus.
[4208.98s -> 4214.42s]  I think I'm going the right way?
[4214.42s -> 4215.86s]  I'm missing a lot of stuff though.
[4217.93s -> 4219.69s]  He's doing his bit voice.
[4223.03s -> 4223.91s]  You can always tell.
[4224.31s -> 4224.87s]  That's true.
[4225.59s -> 4228.62s]  Whenever I lower my tone,
[4229.58s -> 4231.74s]  and I talk really like this,
[4231.74s -> 4233.42s]  and I'm just like, that's, you got it.
[4233.42s -> 4233.82s]  You're right.
[4233.82s -> 4234.86s]  That's my bit voice.
[4236.04s -> 4238.84s]  That's my like, slightly kind of, you know,
[4239.56s -> 4242.30s]  really slowed down, mellow.
[4242.30s -> 4244.70s]  Yeah, I mean, I just wish it like, you know,
[4244.70s -> 4245.42s]  that's how you can tell.
[4248.14s -> 4249.82s]  Although, here's the problem though.
[4249.82s -> 4251.50s]  I have talked with that tone,
[4253.37s -> 4255.61s]  when talking about serious stuff too.
[4255.61s -> 4256.25s]  So it's, I don't know.
[4256.25s -> 4258.17s]  That's my, I'm serious voice,
[4258.17s -> 4260.41s]  but you can tell when it's pretend serious.
[4260.41s -> 4260.91s]  Somehow.
[4267.90s -> 4268.94s]  All the bit to you.
[4269.74s -> 4274.68s]  Okay, I'm stop locked.
[4274.68s -> 4280.38s]  No, not everything is a bit.
[4280.38s -> 4281.42s]  Just most things are.
[4282.06s -> 4292.15s]  I think, honestly, I like to operate in a world,
[4292.15s -> 4293.83s]  like in my own world here.
[4293.83s -> 4299.06s]  Where really, really important shit is not a bit, of course.
[4299.94s -> 4303.50s]  But I stream to have fun.
[4303.50s -> 4304.30s]  That's what I'm doing here.
[4305.02s -> 4307.19s]  So that's why I've always said like,
[4307.19s -> 4308.71s]  90% of the things you hear on stream
[4308.71s -> 4310.23s]  are just me having fun,
[4310.23s -> 4311.35s]  because that's what I want to do here.
[4311.35s -> 4312.39s]  That's what I'm doing here.
[4313.11s -> 4314.47s]  I don't really have another purpose here,
[4314.47s -> 4316.79s]  besides to try to have like fun,
[4316.79s -> 4317.75s]  make a fun environment.
[4317.75s -> 4318.25s]  That's it.
[4318.79s -> 4319.29s]  So yeah.
[4320.15s -> 4323.14s]  So let's talk about that time that I,
[4324.02s -> 4328.86s]  Clint's Breath of the Wild Season 2.
[4331.05s -> 4331.77s]  No, go back.
[4331.77s -> 4332.97s]  There's so much more shit over here.
[4333.61s -> 4335.75s]  That was the serious voice.
[4335.75s -> 4338.15s]  But yeah, but it wasn't a bit though.
[4338.15s -> 4338.71s]  You see what I'm saying?
[4338.71s -> 4339.43s]  You understand the difference?
[4340.23s -> 4341.43s]  That was not a bit.
[4341.43s -> 4342.55s]  That was me being for real.
[4343.51s -> 4349.80s]  Are we a joke to you?
[4358.71s -> 4366.71s]  I couldn't, I couldn't hold it.
[4366.71s -> 4375.90s]  I couldn't hold it in Santa.
[4375.90s -> 4376.40s]  Holy shit.
[4379.24s -> 4380.68s]  He's, he's cracking.
[4387.46s -> 4389.62s]  Hey, by the way, nobody counted that down.
[4390.26s -> 4392.50s]  I'm, I see you all moved on from that one real quick.
[4393.14s -> 4406.17s]  Why do you keep ignoring the Breath of the Wild question?
[4408.58s -> 4410.42s]  I'm not, I, I'm going to play it.
[4410.42s -> 4411.06s]  I just don't know.
[4411.86s -> 4424.54s]  They're going in or I don't know what I'm going to do.
[4426.44s -> 4428.60s]  I've got obviously things that I would like to play.
[4428.60s -> 4429.72s]  Breath of the Wild is one of them.
[4430.52s -> 4448.60s]  Oh, I meant to say finish it.
[4453.27s -> 4455.35s]  No, I don't know why I haven't played it again.
[4455.35s -> 4457.35s]  Honestly, it hasn't, it doesn't have anything to do with.
[4458.23s -> 4459.67s]  I can't really speak to a reason why.
[4460.39s -> 4463.02s]  Oh my God.
[4463.02s -> 4463.50s]  Okay, hold on.
[4463.50s -> 4478.26s]  Let me hold this for a second.
[4478.26s -> 4479.06s]  Nice.
[4479.06s -> 4485.00s]  Holy shit, that was cool.
[4485.72s -> 4487.56s]  Oh, I wish I could just run fast through this.
[4487.56s -> 4490.92s]  Like everybody else that plays this game did.
[4491.48s -> 4493.32s]  I wish I just could run through them.
[4494.12s -> 4495.48s]  Like everybody else did.
[4496.04s -> 4497.88s]  Everybody else did it that way, but I didn't.
[4498.60s -> 4520.33s]  This level is really, really cool.
[4522.49s -> 4525.29s]  Oh, hot sauce on pizza is actually like 10 out of 10.
[4526.25s -> 4529.51s]  You should get banned for like five minutes someday.
[4529.51s -> 4530.55s]  I think it'd be pretty thrilling.
[4531.59s -> 4534.23s]  It would also probably like potentially ruin my life.
[4534.23s -> 4536.07s]  So I don't think I want to.
[4538.79s -> 4540.07s]  But what do you mean banned for five?
[4540.07s -> 4542.63s]  Yeah, you don't get banned for five minutes on Twitch.
[4544.52s -> 4545.88s]  Banned for five minutes?
[4546.60s -> 4548.28s]  That's a bathroom break.
[4549.08s -> 4551.48s]  Should I, when I go pee, should I just say I'm getting banned?
[4552.28s -> 4560.87s]  Um, what am I doing here?
[4560.87s -> 4571.21s]  Is there a tutorial I should have?
[4571.21s -> 4575.42s]  Oh, I hold.
[4576.22s -> 4576.46s]  What?
[4577.26s -> 4579.42s]  Holy shit.
[4581.19s -> 4581.99s]  Holy crap.
[4590.39s -> 4591.59s]  Banned for five minutes.
[4592.31s -> 4596.87s]  Yeah, guys, Twitch bans do not operate the same way
[4596.87s -> 4599.03s]  as when you get timed out in this channel
[4600.15s -> 4601.99s]  for saying something strange.
[4602.63s -> 4617.18s]  Although, I mean, some people have been banned here for a pretty long time.
[4617.18s -> 4625.91s]  Some people get banned permanently.
[4626.63s -> 4651.86s]  I got banned for three years at one point.
[4651.86s -> 4657.62s]  And did you say you were sorry?
[4670.55s -> 4671.11s]  Oh, shit.
[4671.67s -> 4674.41s]  I wasn't prepared for that, but now I have to go.
[4710.74s -> 4712.66s]  Oh, never.
[4712.66s -> 4747.80s]  This is the best song in the game.
[4748.60s -> 4768.70s]  I got two minutes.
[4768.70s -> 4771.70s]  Free milk.
[4771.70s -> 4774.36s]  Oh, shit.
[4774.36s -> 4774.60s]  What?
[4775.32s -> 4776.63s]  Okay.
[4776.63s -> 4778.63s]  Well, I got a 51 hit combo.
[4779.51s -> 4798.94s]  A good baseline can change anything.
[4798.94s -> 4809.70s]  that changes everything i think the i think the bass player the bass does not get the
[4809.70s -> 4815.56s]  credit that i think a lot of do they deserve the base of a song is what holds the whole
[4815.56s -> 4834.76s]  it's the glue of the whole song 10 bucks i can go up another floor no no no uh did i do this one
[4834.76s -> 4872.31s]  what's this music the pig city the person didn't even do anything wrong what long shrimp oh is
[4872.31s -> 4881.93s]  anybody else feel this way if okay i'm not a big shrimp person when shrimp is i want to say more i
[4881.93s -> 4889.14s]  don't like big shrimp they're too meaty and they're too weird i'm i don't like it when shrimp goes
[4889.14s -> 4943.06s]  above a certain size i no longer like it okay get in what um okay smoking okay well i gotta try to
[4943.06s -> 4984.18s]  get off me pineapple on pizza couldn't fucking be there but jerma what about the sweet and savory
[4984.34s -> 5013.67s]  sweet and soft stop come on i can break it going this way i know i can oh my god bro didn't even
[5013.67s -> 5030.25s]  think about the sweet and savory yeah you did uh i'm gonna be completely real with you let's talk
[5030.25s -> 5034.09s]  pineapple on pizza it's not the fact that there's pineapple on the pizza because pineapple
[5034.09s -> 5039.58s]  has those who have been here for years that's probably my favorite fruit pineapple is my
[5039.58s -> 5048.09s]  favorite fruit pineapple maybe in banana and lemon um but it's a textural thing pineapple is very
[5048.09s -> 5055.88s]  fibrous and it's it's very fibrous and stringy sometimes when you put and it doesn't match with
[5055.88s -> 5063.16s]  the pizza for me i love pineapple it's just the fibrous pineapple does not match with like a crust
[5063.16s -> 5070.38s]  in the sauce this doesn't do it for me you like it and good for you i'm glad you do get it away
[5070.38s -> 5077.82s]  from me and never talk about it in my presence good for you though like i'm happy i'm glad i'm
[5077.82s -> 5107.38s]  happy for you wonder if i should have gone the other way first wait hold on banana on pizza um
[5109.54s -> 5125.00s]  i can't believe it happened again i can't believe it happened again no we're good
[5129.19s -> 5136.82s]  i don't like warm pineapple yeah you i think you just actually figured it out for me seriously
[5137.54s -> 5150.78s]  if i'm really honest oh thanks i gotta forget um to me fruit should be cold i like when fruit
[5150.78s -> 5157.08s]  is cold not when it's hot i think that's you just unlock the reason why i don't like um apple pie
[5158.84s -> 5164.76s]  i'm not like a big warm apples like warm fruits it just doesn't do it i think that's what it is
[5165.32s -> 5172.38s]  apple cider is not the same because it's a drink that's a it's a drink i drink hot
[5172.94s -> 5194.73s]  coffee hot i drink ice coffee too i don't prefer it either way so i do like hot coffee blueberry
[5194.73s -> 5209.21s]  pie no i my top eyes are banana cream and then uh chocolate cream i like the cream based pies like
[5209.21s -> 5216.15s]  banana cream banana cream pie is it's so high up on s tier that it's an insult if anybody thinks
[5216.15s -> 5219.99s]  anyone thinks that it's even close to anything else it's it's when you talk about pies banana
[5219.99s -> 5227.11s]  cream pie is s plus plus plus plus every other fucking pie is like could be s or lower not even
[5227.11s -> 5233.02s]  close and mods i'm getting real sick of people fucking talking like this just start timing people
[5233.02s -> 5243.46s]  let that disappear with me i don't know what's wrong with me tonight i'm sorry i'm a weirdo
[5246.39s -> 5273.14s]  i'm in a good mood today i don't know today tonight hey all right let me ask you about what's that do
[5273.14s -> 5278.89s]  you want to talk semantics it is is it today or is it tonight and does today still work because
[5278.89s -> 5287.50s]  it technically is still the same day it's still that no it's today it's still the same day
[5288.22s -> 5306.22s]  love that laugh who did some of the voice work nice fucking job seriously you get it it's not
[5306.22s -> 5327.48s]  just stock sounds i mean it's a vague question i still think today works because it's when you
[5327.48s -> 5338.81s]  say a day you know sunday right monday tuesday it's not tuesday night you know at seven o'clock
[5338.81s -> 5368.50s]  on tuesday it does not become tuesday night checkmate yeah you would say it is thursday night
[5368.50s -> 5398.60s]  it's still thursday thursday night it's not thursday night this that was crazy are they
[5398.60s -> 5436.25s]  drinking a milkshake that's funny oh that's funny thermal watch this back flip what the holy shit
[5436.25s -> 5445.19s]  oh my god dude whoa what the fuck that was that was awesome you can just do that
[5446.55s -> 5452.65s]  from your chair i've never seen something to do that before like from your from a seated position
[5452.65s -> 5457.78s]  holy shit man just like call somebody it's not like the fucking news or something
[5471.46s -> 5476.50s]  you might have somebody seated it how seated in a chair and just lunging themselves up and back to
[5476.50s -> 5485.24s]  the point where they could backflip out of the chair okay it's probably some you know performers
[5485.24s -> 5493.26s]  or something they can probably do something similar i feel like that's incredibly dangerous
[5493.26s -> 5518.18s]  and should never be attempted i think my buddy eric could do it oh that should absolutely never
[5518.18s -> 5525.11s]  be attempted buddy eric should never attempt that do not attempt that that's a piece of pizza
[5525.11s -> 5537.64s]  with a piece of fish on it will you do lap two from my understanding lap two can only happen
[5537.64s -> 5549.66s]  if you beat the level already so i don't have to go back and do it again eric is different
[5551.34s -> 5560.71s]  you made eric up that's the difference but yes eric is different you made them up
[5562.47s -> 5580.07s]  i think that was the best song in the game i want to see tons of people dancing i want to see
[5580.07s -> 5616.76s]  sons of of cat dancing rat dancing doing that i'm not doing this well at all what's happening
[5618.47s -> 5635.96s]  look up
[5654.07s -> 5704.62s]  fucking crazy does somebody have to be driving to have that reaction only be fixed up somebody
[5704.62s -> 5729.70s]  else to kill ah well i think i spent too much time in the taxis let's do it if you got two taxis
[5731.34s -> 5752.55s]  no secrets either yeah there's kind of junk you did the boss i'll try the boss
[5753.11s -> 5759.85s]  i got one more level here and the boss
[5772.09s -> 5813.99s]  oh what is this you know versus pino what i don't get it okay um what is he oh do i just

[6106.14s -> 6128.95s]  this one's crazy st around this one good luck no hit run on this no way see if i could carry it
[6128.95s -> 6139.96s]  i mean i'd rather jump over it i'm more i i any game where i can dodge something i'm way better
[6139.96s -> 6221.37s]  at doing that than actually parrying it shit i thought i was ready where am i wrong one i'll
[6221.37s -> 6232.26s]  take a b on there help when you get trapped you just you just fucked i'll take a c on this one
[6232.26s -> 6261.14s]  okay this one's really really hard don't do this to me like that i can't even get the health off i
[6261.14s -> 6330.71s]  can't even touch the health cocaine game oh what's wait wait wait why did this happen what
[6330.71s -> 6346.04s]  this didn't happen last time my god crack game stop oh my goodness stop getting attached to every
[6346.04s -> 6380.86s]  wall i think i'm i'm fine did i do it whoa was i just completely just blanked right there do not
[6380.86s -> 6408.18s]  enter not do not enter inside do not go inside believe crack game i can do better than that
[6416.25s -> 6485.11s]  that face i'm just realizing that face blow it already that backwards jump never seen that
[6485.11s -> 6540.46s]  before backwards backwards jump what the heck excuse me excuse me why did i not parried that
[6540.46s -> 6560.68s]  when he ran by me i don't care i'm leaving did i yeah i did them all didn't i nope i have that
[6560.68s -> 6586.94s]  one more but let's see staff only get out the elusive p rank you can get it by doing everything
[6586.94s -> 6592.46s]  there is to do in a level problem is that you need to keep a combo for the entirety of the level
[6593.10s -> 6598.28s]  it's a tough challenge so don't feel bad if you don't want to do it it's not just not get hit
[6598.36s -> 6602.60s]  it's you have to keep a combo going the whole entire time holy
[6602.60s -> 6613.22s]  shit how come you don't have uh tts um it's it's very i'm an incredibly distractible person
[6614.54s -> 6621.67s]  and i feel like tts tts would just distract me every five seconds and i would never be able
[6621.67s -> 6631.51s]  to pay attention to anything ever i've never done it before and i probably will never do it
[6632.15s -> 6640.81s]  ever although i can't honestly i can't appreciate um obviously you watch some streamers that have
[6640.81s -> 6647.62s]  tts on and sometimes it can be really really funny t honestly tts for a lot of other streamers kind
[6647.62s -> 6652.81s]  of in a way is sort of a one guy moment because like there's been tons of moments where i've like
[6652.81s -> 6658.09s]  seen a stream where like uh tts was just like hilarious and it's just like wow okay well that's
[6658.09s -> 6664.65s]  funny but also i tts can get spammed pretty hard um and there's a difference to think between
[6665.37s -> 6671.11s]  like tts spam and somebody saying something funny i guess um but it's like i don't know it's a
[6671.11s -> 6675.27s]  community engagement it's a way to get like your audience to feel the like hang out participate
[6675.27s -> 6681.11s]  make jokes make references do whatever they want um but it's just not here i understand why people
[6681.11s -> 6693.42s]  do it though just mute it yeah take a stance that's a centrist idea i mean i just i just told you i
[6693.42s -> 6698.22s]  don't do it and i don't want to do it but i can understand why somebody would do it is that
[6698.22s -> 6707.54s]  centrist i did i took i did take a stance that is my stance that no i don't like it and i don't
[6707.54s -> 6718.47s]  want to do it so okay the centrist stance with that would be tts interesting idea and well on
[6718.47s -> 6723.91s]  one hand i can see why i would do it i might i'm thinking about it but i haven't i haven't decided
[6723.91s -> 6728.47s]  yet i think that what i would like to do with tts is maybe look into it a little bit more and
[6728.47s -> 6735.27s]  see what this uh why it would be on but the other case it being off is like i being on i could see
[6735.27s -> 6750.20s]  that no i i took a stance oh he's getting stun locked all right uh i want to go to the other
[6750.20s -> 6758.90s]  level that's pretty much what you said no i made my stance on how i feel about it then i told you
[6758.90s -> 6764.18s]  how i can i can still understand because it's like a one guy moment for some people and here's another
[6764.18s -> 6771.70s]  thing how about this centrist take you ready a lot of streamers that have huge huge audiences and i'm
[6771.70s -> 6776.78s]  talking into the tens of thousands right how do you get a one guy moment you can't even read
[6777.58s -> 6782.78s]  sometimes you can't even see what anybody is saying right like so i can understand that
[6785.38s -> 6790.98s]  this channel is still at a point where i can look over here and i can see at least for a second
[6790.98s -> 6808.25s]  sometimes what somebody is saying what's your review of the game so far uh well on one hand
[6808.97s -> 6814.66s]  i can see how somebody would like this game um it's got really cool artwork it's got really
[6814.74s -> 6818.58s]  interesting scenarios um i can see how some people would want to play it and get some
[6818.58s -> 6824.18s]  something out of that but on the other hand it's a cocaine game and i know i just i can see how
[6824.18s -> 6829.54s]  some people would be not that's really really hard to play um it's super intense so i can
[6829.54s -> 6848.15s]  understand that and that's my take all right where's this last level that i didn't go to
[6853.83s -> 6896.68s]  pizza scare uh castlevania yeah can you please be more in the middle please be more in the middle
[6900.71s -> 6936.25s]  i am danos i am danos i am danos what does that do what's this doing kill the ghost
[6936.25s -> 6940.41s]  do i just kill them all like do i have to kill them all is that like part of this
[6941.21s -> 6946.02s]  it said literally yeah i know i know it said kill the ghost but do i have to
[6946.02s -> 6952.68s]  do i have to kill them all to like progress or something does it matter or does it just
[6952.68s -> 6982.44s]  it gives me the ability to a lot of things in this level can just stop you in your tracks and hurt
[6982.44s -> 7012.10s]  you everything can hurt you in this level what's happening right now what's going on this thing's
[7012.10s -> 7053.85s]  just okay get out of here this level's too stressful i don't like it it doesn't let me
[7053.85s -> 7135.34s]  slow down and explore pekino's world how do you break the bowling pins to this one whoa voting

[7185.54s -> 7242.73s]  fucking hops uh avoided elite gameplay you have any idea how hard this game is you know how hard
[7242.73s -> 7250.15s]  this game is right you have any idea it's simply not just left and right and jump you get attached
[7250.15s -> 7255.93s]  to surfaces like the roadrunner game for the yes nas you have any idea you have any idea how hard

[7638.84s -> 7659.26s]  you know you could really could lose some weight hey what about what's up there
[7659.82s -> 7673.06s]  do you have anything to say no you missed a level on the last floor
[7676.73s -> 7721.77s]  oh you're right i did whatever this one was it's just so so bizarre looking okay

[7799.02s -> 7806.65s]  trouble getting used to is holding right trigger forever when you want to stay running just like
[7807.61s -> 7842.62s]  can't do it i guess we're there hmm you'll hold y forever but not right trigger yeah because
[7842.62s -> 7850.46s]  over a hundred years of video games holding y holding well it's x on the xbox has been like
[7850.46s -> 7863.85s]  run super mario made that very clear over the last hundred years when the pilgrims were playing
[7863.85s -> 7924.76s]  mario they were holding y that is eons of gaming sorry let uh lap two oh i gotta jump it's

[11902.30s -> 11943.62s]  i'm not gonna get p on one level centrist take because i don't want to get what about isaac
[11943.62s -> 11948.89s]  i'm probably gonna stop here there's a lot of stuff that has to happen this weekend
[11949.61s -> 11956.41s]  it's gonna be very busy but i pulled the stream back to today because i want i knew there was
[11956.41s -> 11961.75s]  only like three four hours in this game left so i might as well just go just get done play it have
[11961.75s -> 11969.26s]  fun and then get to work on some stuff what about frog detective frog detective will be
[11970.06s -> 11985.61s]  before the end of february that's still happening didn't make that up any post credits enjoyers
[11985.61s -> 11999.30s]  here let's see yeah hylix is as well let's see let me look at a good timetable here
[12005.37s -> 12009.61s]  well here i got an here's the thing how long is frog detective three
[12011.58s -> 12016.46s]  that they're all of them have been two or three hours long right like three hours four hours
[12020.10s -> 12033.42s]  they're only a couple hours each aren't they depends on how fast you go about two hours yeah
[12033.42s -> 12041.88s]  so okay here here is the plan i sauce is gonna say that there's no stream until early this coming
[12041.88s -> 12049.93s]  week and then probably on monday or tuesday we're gonna play frog detective three and then after
[12049.93s -> 12073.03s]  that we're gonna move to hylix in the same stream and then after that we'll see in the same time
[12073.91s -> 12077.72s]  i'm gonna be talking a lot about grotto beasts i know a lot of people are waiting for it a lot
[12077.72s -> 12085.96s]  of people excited for it it's uh it has been a journey but everybody on the team is incredibly
[12085.96s -> 12097.34s]  excited for it everyone's super happy cannot wait to show you some things in the next five or six
[12097.34s -> 12109.96s]  days is there gonna be a lot of announcements yeah you set the sauce for our early next week
[12110.52s -> 12115.67s]  i mean it's gonna has to be monday or tuesday because otherwise i i'm in breach of contract
[12115.67s -> 12125.18s]  with chat or playing frog detective for the end of february so it has to be them what are you
[12125.18s -> 12142.28s]  announcing i'm announcing grotto beasts you'll see you'll see it's gonna be a multi it's gonna
[12142.28s -> 12150.15s]  be multi-layered so there's gonna be essentially two or three different times that you need to be
[12150.15s -> 12159.91s]  aware of we're doing our best to try to make sure as many people can get it and what we're
[12159.91s -> 12164.47s]  gonna probably do a presale to make sure because i know a lot of people saying but wait what if
[12164.47s -> 12168.63s]  it just goes on sale and i and i want it and then like somebody buys a thousand of them or
[12168.63s -> 12180.09s]  something right that's we're gonna make sure that that's not gonna happen we're doing a presale is
[12180.09s -> 12191.62s]  it a pyramid scheme it's not a fucking pyramid scheme oh my my grand pyramid scheme no what the
[12191.62s -> 12208.34s]  fuck most no oh because i said i'm an idiot i said multi-level no i said multi-layer
[12210.44s -> 12218.92s]  shit i did just say i put multi in the front of that i said multi-level but i didn't oh god damn
[12218.92s -> 12227.43s]  it okay but i get multi-layered announcements is what i meant multi-layered rollout multi-layered
[12227.43s -> 12232.79s]  rollout not multi-level marketing that let's correct it immediately before everybody thinks
[12232.87s -> 12250.92s]  what the fuck is he talking about he's so stupid i would never oh my god
[12254.58s -> 12268.55s]  all right post credits anything or is it just on this for now there's going to be a big faq
[12268.55s -> 12275.27s]  that's going to answer a ton of questions as well uh it's being worked on we want to make sure that
[12275.27s -> 12295.18s]  everything's accurate there what's the game rate this game oh he looks so stressed oh no
[12309.05s -> 12326.78s]  capino's pizza animated film when capino's pizza animated series when no i'm just kidding
[12326.78s -> 12359.45s]  that was phenomenal excellent excellent excellent excellent you know final judgment no i got a d
[12360.09s -> 12383.75s]  that's the one officer wow oh hey d plus is uh is passing grade one percent off too bad yeah
[12383.75s -> 12408.30s]  too bad psycho b is failing b is not failing that was awesome yeah i'll uh i'll see you guys
[12409.18s -> 12416.04s]  next week early next week with a bunch of stuff to talk about again we're really trying to shoot
[12416.04s -> 12425.16s]  for that 28th february i really kind of start talking about a lot of stuff uh it's come together
[12425.88s -> 12432.42s]  i told you very briefly before but this project started off as kind of a little oh like a fun
[12432.42s -> 12441.29s]  little thing to do and then it grew into a decade of references and it's essentially just
[12442.09s -> 12446.02s]  i know a lot of people ask about merch and hey how come you don't do merch why don't you have
[12446.02s -> 12450.44s]  this merch how come you don't do that merch and figured this is kind of an interesting thing to do
[12451.24s -> 12457.80s]  and having hundreds of these cards that you could just get if you wanted to you know nobody's
[12457.80s -> 12464.82s]  no one's ever obligated to buy a single goddamn thing but i just thought it was a fun it's a fun
