[0.31s -> 10.56s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[10.56s -> 14.56s]  Jerma here, wait a second, Otto, you have to make your camera debut.
[14.56s -> 20.06s]  Jerma and Otto, and there's actually somebody else in this call, go ahead and introduce yourself.
[20.06s -> 21.37s]  Hi.
[21.37s -> 22.54s]  Who's that?
[22.54s -> 25.41s]  It's Boo.
[25.41s -> 32.58s]  But yes, Otto wanted to say hello, because you haven't had a checkup with Otto in a while, he's doing okay.
[32.58s -> 37.89s]  See, he's got a good face, he's got a good white stripe, he's a good dog.
[37.89s -> 39.89s]  He was actually lying down right here for a while.
[39.89s -> 42.89s]  But yeah, Space Game Fortress 2, this is Monday's edition.
[42.89s -> 44.89s]  Hope you're having a fantastic Monday.
[44.89s -> 48.89s]  I'm just like standing still, like oh, let me like talk for like five minutes, just not play.
[48.89s -> 51.45s]  I have no idea who I killed, but they're dead.
[51.45s -> 56.45s]  So Otto wanted to get down, he's down there now, and oh my god, what just even killed me, I don't even know.
[56.45s -> 59.25s]  I don't even know.
[59.25s -> 62.06s]  But we're on offense now.
[62.06s -> 65.65s]  We are on the offense.
[65.65s -> 68.08s]  And I changed what I was using.
[68.08s -> 72.96s]  I want to get my scarcely lethal...
[72.96s -> 73.96s]  I think that's what it is.
[73.96s -> 75.96s]  Scarcely lethal...
[75.96s -> 77.96s]  Why can't I not even think of the name of this weapon?
[77.96s -> 78.96s]  The Liberty Launcher.
[78.96s -> 80.96s]  Scarcely lethal gun.
[80.96s -> 82.39s]  No!
[82.39s -> 83.70s]  Hide.
[83.70s -> 86.13s]  Watch the dead ring spy behind us.
[86.13s -> 87.13s]  Oh god, really?
[87.13s -> 89.13s]  No, he's a scout.
[89.13s -> 90.13s]  No, I got him.
[90.13s -> 92.43s]  Oh, is he truly dead though?
[92.43s -> 95.43s]  Yeah, I got a new rank on my pistol for it.
[95.43s -> 98.43s]  That's one way to tell.
[100.82s -> 102.82s]  Oh, how did I not kill him?
[102.82s -> 106.60s]  Very, very good.
[106.60s -> 110.60s]  Is that actually like a spy check, or does it fake that to be your new rank on your weapon?
[110.60s -> 112.60s]  I don't think it would fake that.
[112.60s -> 114.60s]  That's something I would...
[114.60s -> 115.60s]  That would be very weird if it did.
[115.60s -> 117.97s]  The spy is up top right here.
[117.97s -> 118.97s]  Oh, I see him.
[118.97s -> 119.97s]  I think he's dead, I don't know.
[119.97s -> 120.97s]  No, he's not.
[120.97s -> 123.97s]  He's actually like stuffed in this corner over here with me.
[123.97s -> 126.97s]  And he got the health too, that prickly bastard.
[126.97s -> 129.87s]  Hey, there's a spy here.
[129.87s -> 130.87s]  Watch it.
[130.87s -> 131.87s]  Oh, I just picked up the ammo.
[131.87s -> 132.87s]  I'm sorry, dude.
[132.87s -> 133.87s]  That guy's an energy.
[133.87s -> 135.37s]  I got him.
[135.37s -> 136.37s]  You got him?
[136.37s -> 137.37s]  Yep.
[137.37s -> 138.37s]  Okay, good.
[138.37s -> 139.37s]  I'm gonna go put a tele-exit upstairs.
[139.37s -> 142.37s]  Oh, we are absolutely rolling right now.
[142.37s -> 146.70s]  All right, black box soldier coming from the upstairs.
[146.70s -> 148.87s]  Ooh, really?
[148.87s -> 156.06s]  You know what?
[156.06s -> 157.06s]  You die.
[157.06s -> 161.06s]  We have a friendly spy crabbing out of spawn, making his way through the field.
[161.06s -> 163.06s]  Oh wait, we have a wild spy crab?
[163.06s -> 166.33s]  Really?
[166.33s -> 168.33s]  I didn't know we had a wild spy crab.
[168.33s -> 172.09s]  That makes me happy.
[173.09s -> 174.09s]  All right, let's push this car.
[174.09s -> 175.09s]  Nobody here.
[175.09s -> 178.09s]  Oh, this is a heavy...
[178.09s -> 179.09s]  I want to go back and just shoot that guy.
[179.09s -> 181.09s]  He probably has no health.
[181.09s -> 182.71s]  But there's nobody here.
[182.71s -> 183.71s]  Where is everybody?
[183.71s -> 184.95s]  Oh my word.
[184.95s -> 185.95s]  Where's the sentry?
[185.95s -> 187.96s]  Where's that sentry gun?
[187.96s -> 189.96s]  Is it up top behind everybody?
[189.96s -> 191.71s]  I don't see it.
[191.71s -> 195.87s]  It must be up on the corridor.
[195.87s -> 197.37s]  Hmm.
[197.37s -> 200.31s]  What does this take?
[200.31s -> 206.11s]  I swear, that sentry is up here somewhere.
[206.11s -> 210.27s]  Maybe I'm just crazy and it was a heavy behind me or something.
[210.27s -> 212.27s]  No, it's definitely up here.
[212.27s -> 213.27s]  They have a teleport.
[213.27s -> 214.27s]  They're all kinds of guys.
[214.27s -> 217.09s]  They got a lot of things up here.
[217.09s -> 218.09s]  Oh boy.
[218.09s -> 220.09s]  Oh my God.
[220.09s -> 221.09s]  Oh my God.
[221.09s -> 222.09s]  Screw the spy.
[222.09s -> 224.09s]  We got to take this stuff out.
[224.09s -> 225.09s]  No!
[225.09s -> 228.09s]  Liberty launcher, this is not the good place for you.
[228.09s -> 230.22s]  Oh, I got one sentry.
[230.22s -> 234.51s]  Oh my God.
[234.51s -> 236.58s]  Damn.
[236.58s -> 238.46s]  Oh, we got to...
[238.46s -> 241.22s]  Just trying to wall bang this guy.
[241.22s -> 242.22s]  Come on.
[242.22s -> 243.65s]  No, I got the other sentry.
[243.65s -> 244.65s]  Oh, you got him.
[244.65s -> 245.65s]  I got the engie.
[245.65s -> 246.65s]  I got it.
[246.65s -> 247.65s]  Oh, spy.
[247.65s -> 248.65s]  Both of them down.
[248.65s -> 249.65s]  Both sentry down, though.
[249.65s -> 250.65s]  Two spies up there.
[250.65s -> 253.46s]  Oh, there's a guy disguised as me.
[253.46s -> 255.66s]  Doctor...
[255.66s -> 256.66s]  If you see a demo man.
[256.66s -> 257.66s]  What was that guy's name?
[257.66s -> 258.66s]  Doctor Octo...
[258.66s -> 262.59s]  Octomagopus?
[262.59s -> 263.59s]  Rocket jump.
[263.59s -> 264.59s]  Rocket jump.
[264.59s -> 267.22s]  Right on top of the health.
[267.22s -> 268.22s]  That was my plan.
[268.22s -> 269.22s]  Grabby.
[269.22s -> 270.97s]  Oh, watch out.
[270.97s -> 271.97s]  That medic.
[271.97s -> 272.97s]  Where are you going?
[272.97s -> 273.97s]  That medic.
[273.97s -> 276.97s]  Oh man, that medic just backed up into hell.
[276.97s -> 284.99s]  Oh, you bastard.
[284.99s -> 287.99s]  Possibly a spy disguised as me, a demo man.
[287.99s -> 288.99s]  Okay.
[288.99s -> 291.81s]  Oh, there's a spy disguised as a soldier.
[291.81s -> 292.81s]  What?
[292.81s -> 293.81s]  What?
[293.81s -> 294.81s]  What the...
[294.81s -> 298.81s]  All right, I want everyone to go back and watch that.
[298.81s -> 302.35s]  That guy, he was reloading.
[302.35s -> 309.35s]  And it looked like he was putting his hand down on the dispenser to sap it.
[309.35s -> 312.35s]  That was one of the oddest things I've ever seen.
[312.35s -> 314.35s]  Oh, you stupid spy.
[314.35s -> 317.10s]  You are not dead.
[317.10s -> 318.86s]  That was ridiculous.
[318.86s -> 324.55s]  Man, we got to get a push here.
[324.55s -> 328.22s]  We're just stuck in the alleyways.
[328.22s -> 330.62s]  Anything else?
[330.62s -> 336.44s]  Get rid of all this garbage here.
[336.44s -> 339.44s]  Heavy medic and a pyro coming as well through the tunnel.
[339.44s -> 342.62s]  I got the pyro.
[342.62s -> 343.62s]  Oh, a spy.
[343.62s -> 345.79s]  Man, they don't really have anything here, do they?
[345.79s -> 347.79s]  It just dropped down.
[347.79s -> 350.42s]  Get on this cot, get on this cot.
[350.42s -> 352.42s]  Push it, baby, push it.
[352.42s -> 354.42s]  You've got to push it.
[354.42s -> 356.42s]  You've got to push it.
[356.42s -> 358.42s]  Heavy medic and pyro on the bridge.
[358.42s -> 361.23s]  That medic is insane.
[361.23s -> 363.23s]  What's he doing?
[363.23s -> 364.23s]  Nothing I could do there.
[364.23s -> 365.23s]  I got one kill.
[365.23s -> 366.86s]  It's almost there.
[366.86s -> 368.86s]  It's almost there.
[368.86s -> 369.86s]  Are we going to close it?
[369.86s -> 371.86s]  Oh, no, I'm out of coffee.
[371.86s -> 376.92s]  Four and a half minutes.
[376.92s -> 377.92s]  We got this, boo.
[377.92s -> 378.92s]  Center's gone down.
[378.92s -> 382.50s]  I'll change from demo.
[382.50s -> 383.50s]  Oh, my phone's ringing.
[383.50s -> 386.26s]  My phone's always just ringing.
[386.26s -> 390.07s]  It's either Burger Boy or like Mama Germ.
[390.07s -> 392.72s]  Where are you going?
[392.72s -> 394.73s]  Where are you going?
[394.73s -> 395.73s]  Where are you going?
[395.73s -> 400.12s]  I'm just going to club this guy right in the face.
[400.12s -> 402.51s]  I kind of did.
[402.51s -> 404.33s]  We're going to get it.
[404.33s -> 405.33s]  We're going to get it.
[405.33s -> 407.53s]  This is it.
[407.53s -> 409.53s]  Oh, don't uber me on the cart.
[409.53s -> 411.60s]  Nice.
[411.60s -> 412.60s]  Nice job, team.
[412.60s -> 414.16s]  Good job, dudes.
[414.16s -> 417.83s]  Yeah.
[417.83s -> 419.52s]  All right.
[419.52s -> 422.52s]  Well, that's going to wrap it up here for Facecam Fortress 2, Monday's edition.
[422.52s -> 424.52s]  Boo, thanks for joining me.
[424.52s -> 425.52s]  I'm looking at the camera.
[425.52s -> 426.52s]  I don't even know where I'm looking.
[426.52s -> 428.52s]  But thanks for joining me, boo.
[428.52s -> 429.52s]  Always a pleasure.
[429.52s -> 432.52s]  And thanks, everyone else, for joining me as well.
[432.52s -> 433.70s]  And boo.
[433.70s -> 434.70s]  So see you guys the next time.
[434.70s -> 435.70s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
[435.70s -> 437.83s]  Bye bye.
[437.83s -> 438.83s]  Where's Otto?
[438.83s -> 439.83s]  Otto, you have to say bye.
[439.83s -> 441.84s]  Otto, come here.
[441.84s -> 444.81s]  Otto, come here.
[444.81s -> 446.24s]  He was just like...
[446.24s -> 447.24s]  Oh, I just...
[447.24s -> 449.25s]  Otto, I'm sorry.
[449.25s -> 450.49s]  Goodbye, everybody.
[450.49s -> 451.49s]  Thanks for watching Facecam Fortress 2.
[451.49s -> 452.49s]  My name is Otto.
[452.49s -> 453.49s]  Look, look at how tired he is.
