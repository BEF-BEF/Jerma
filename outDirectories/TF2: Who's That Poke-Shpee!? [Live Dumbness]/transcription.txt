[3.32s -> 5.32s]  It's Spy. Spy.
[7.32s -> 12.14s]  Who's that Pokemon? It's Spy.
[12.14s -> 15.08s]  Spy, I choose you.
[15.08s -> 20.34s]  No, if it was like Ash, it would be like...
[20.34s -> 25.18s]  Oh my god, come on, Gerudo. Go get him.
[25.18s -> 26.18s]  Gerudo.
[26.18s -> 30.18s]  No, pull back, Gerudo. You can't do it. He's too strong.
[30.18s -> 31.18s]  Gerudo.
[32.18s -> 34.18s]  Spy, I choose you.
[34.18s -> 35.18s]  It's you.
[37.74s -> 38.74s]  Use Bakespade.
[39.74s -> 44.10s]  It's super effective.
[44.10s -> 48.10s]  Oh wow. Spy, that was fantastic. I really love you.
[53.71s -> 55.71s]  Who's that Pokemon?
[56.71s -> 72.19s]  Hey guys, I'll trade you my holographic Charizard for your holographic Shpee.
[72.19s -> 74.19s]  No, that's not worth it.
[74.19s -> 81.20s]  A holographic Shpee is worth like $500,000.
[81.20s -> 83.57s]  You're gonna try to rip me off right now?
[83.57s -> 88.13s]  There's only one in the world, but I've got the one with Japanese text.
[88.13s -> 92.56s]  Do you really? Do you seriously have that?
[92.56s -> 94.93s]  Did you guys ever like play Pokemon trading cards?
[94.93s -> 99.49s]  Do you seriously have that card though? Because I kind of want it with the Japanese text.
[99.49s -> 106.50s]  Oh my goodness, man. Are you okay?
[106.50s -> 109.50s]  That went right into his mouth. Dude, are you alright?
[109.50s -> 111.50s]  Please get me to a doctor. I'm sorry, just chill out.
[111.50s -> 114.68s]  I gotta pull the arrow out though. Hold on, just don't talk.
[114.68s -> 116.68s]  Just don't talk. Get it out of me, mate. Come on.
[116.68s -> 118.68s]  I'm trying to. I'm really sorry I did that.
[118.68s -> 120.68s]  Oh my god, fucking help. Guys, help, please.
[120.68s -> 123.56s]  Fucking murdered this guy.
[123.56s -> 125.80s]  Turbo, where are you?
[125.80s -> 128.04s]  Gotta get you away from the scene of the crime.
[128.04s -> 130.04s]  I wanna see your trophy.
[130.04s -> 132.04s]  Oh, he's gone. It's too bad.
[132.04s -> 134.04s]  It was absolutely heinous looking.
[134.04s -> 137.30s]  No. Was it a sniper?
[137.30s -> 139.30s]  Yes, it was.
[139.30s -> 142.25s]  Man, that took a lot to do that.
[142.25s -> 145.38s]  That took a lot to do that.
[145.38s -> 147.38s]  Alright, I found nobody.
[147.38s -> 149.38s]  Nobody scared the spy. I found a spy.
[149.38s -> 151.38s]  It's guaranteed that he's a spy.
[151.38s -> 153.56s]  Where are you? Just don't scare him.
[153.56s -> 156.56s]  He's in the wild right now. He doesn't think I know he's a spy.
[156.56s -> 158.56s]  I don't know where you are. He's the scout.
[158.56s -> 161.50s]  Don't kill him. Howie?
[161.50s -> 163.50s]  Oh, you're right behind him. He's right here.
[163.50s -> 165.68s]  He's gonna backstab you, boof.
[167.68s -> 169.68s]  Come on.
[169.68s -> 171.68s]  I'm sorry.
[173.68s -> 175.68s]  I saw that.
[176.68s -> 180.68s]  I didn't know you were playing that heavy.
[180.68s -> 182.68s]  I'm really sorry.
[182.68s -> 186.68s]  Yeah, I'm playing shithead Natasha Gibbous heavy.
[186.68s -> 193.38s]  Oh, boy.
[193.38s -> 198.87s]  Watch out for these shtickies.
[198.87s -> 200.87s]  Don't do what I was gonna do to you, you punk.
[200.87s -> 209.58s]  What? Why?
[209.58s -> 212.84s]  Who did I just kill?
[212.84s -> 214.84s]  I'm so confused right now from that.
[214.84s -> 224.62s]  Scout on the point. Scout on the point.
[224.62s -> 226.98s]  Scout on the point.
[226.98s -> 228.98s]  This will be the last time you do believe I'm on fire.
[228.98s -> 231.86s]  Screw to the poop. Pyro on the poop.
[231.86s -> 235.88s]  Peep on the poop.
[235.88s -> 237.88s]  I can't stay here.
[237.88s -> 240.88s]  Come on. Use your rainy unusual and kill that person.
[240.88s -> 244.34s]  See Ted.
[244.34s -> 247.34s]  The Ted trademark. This guy has a trademarked name.
[247.34s -> 253.08s]  I'll give you a trademark.
[253.08s -> 255.08s]  You can shove that trademark right up your ass.
[255.08s -> 261.10s]  Oh, Pyro. Don't do it.
[261.10s -> 263.85s]  All right, gentlemen. I'll be putting up a dispenser up here.
[263.85s -> 265.85s]  Don't worry.
[265.85s -> 267.85s]  Let me get this thing up here. Don't worry about that.
[267.85s -> 270.41s]  I'm just gonna get some stuff up here.
[270.41s -> 272.41s]  Barack Obama plays engineer.
[275.41s -> 279.38s]  So what's your favorite class, Barack?
[279.38s -> 285.90s]  So the thing is, let me be perfectly clear.
[285.90s -> 287.90s]  As the engineer, I want to give everybody a shot.
[287.90s -> 293.41s]  And, you know...
[293.41s -> 297.80s]  They're fucking spawn camping us.
[297.80s -> 300.55s]  I see that, yeah.
[300.55s -> 306.27s]  People love America. I have arms to solve your practical problems.
[306.27s -> 312.22s]  Actually, Barack Obama's voice kind of does fit on the engineer.
[312.22s -> 316.22s]  If you replace the engineer's voice with the Barack Obama lines...
[316.22s -> 318.90s]  How are you even back...
[318.90s -> 320.90s]  And you're telling me that wasn't a headshot.
[320.90s -> 326.17s]  I don't know what language in what world that's not headshots.
[326.17s -> 331.90s]  But I'll just die again for like a 50th time.
[331.90s -> 334.53s]  If I get an Uber, I'll give it to you.
[334.53s -> 338.53s]  If you give me that Uber, you're gonna be very sad.
[338.53s -> 340.53s]  Just gonna let you know.
[340.53s -> 343.98s]  If you give me that Uber, you are going to cry.
[343.98s -> 345.98s]  Oh, turn around. Holy crap.
[345.98s -> 348.22s]  Don't die.
[348.22s -> 350.53s]  Body shield. Sniper body shield.
[350.53s -> 352.53s]  Alright, you want to go meet people?
[352.53s -> 354.53s]  Wait, I'm gonna grab this health and that'll be it.
[354.53s -> 358.53s]  Alright, do you want to go like metaphorically and physically meet people?
[358.53s -> 360.53s]  Yes, let's do it.
[360.53s -> 362.53s]  Alright, we're gonna go meet the red team.
[362.53s -> 364.53s]  Oh, you actually have meat. Okay, let's go meet people.
[364.53s -> 366.53s]  Let's go meet some friends.
[366.53s -> 370.41s]  Alright, let's go meet this engineer and this whole team.
[370.41s -> 372.41s]  Meet the sniper!
[372.41s -> 374.71s]  Chop chop, mate.
[374.71s -> 376.71s]  Chop chop, mate.
[376.71s -> 377.71s]  Oh crap.
[377.71s -> 379.71s]  Hey, chop chop, mate.
[379.71s -> 384.19s]  Damn it.
[384.19s -> 386.43s]  Well, that's where I...
[386.43s -> 388.43s]  That was one of the better Ubers I've had recently.
[392.14s -> 394.14s]  We actually killed people that time.
[394.14s -> 396.14s]  We actually got a couple kills.
