[1.66s -> 9.59s]  Alright, now we're gonna move on. We're gonna play, um, we're gonna play Cook, Serve, Delicious 2
[9.59s -> 25.70s]  for the remainder of our chillout stream. Let's go ahead and close this and open it up.
[25.70s -> 39.29s]  That's a thing? Yeah, it is a thing, apparently. They're making a third.
[39.93s -> 45.96s]  Are they really making a third? How do you make this game three times?
[49.91s -> 61.98s]  Do you add? What do you add to it? More recipes? No, Xbox Game Bar.
[62.94s -> 65.66s]  Xbox Game Bar. I don't want to take a fucking screenshot.
[66.38s -> 77.32s]  You know what I think the weirdest thing in the world is? Why? Why is Xbox trying to tell me
[77.32s -> 84.20s]  I can take a screenshot with their Xbox game thing? It's like, you just hit print screen
[84.20s -> 92.55s]  and just paste it. Like, what? Hey, in case you know, you can take a screenshot of this game. I
[92.55s -> 98.07s]  know. I know. It's a, it's a button on my keyboard that has been a function for 30 fucking years.
[99.75s -> 111.14s]  What? This song is kind of poppin', I'll tell you though. Now let me change the game.
[111.86s -> 129.06s]  Is the Cook Serve Delicious 2? Is this better than the first one? No, no, yes, no, no, no, no, no,
[129.06s -> 139.38s]  yes, no, no, no. We'll find out. Start game. Here we go. Local saves. Cloud saves. I don't have any
[139.38s -> 148.66s]  saves. Local save. New slave, new slave slot. New save slot. I can't fucking talk. New save slot.
[152.95s -> 159.54s]  It began like any other morning at Sherry's Soda Tower. You rode the elevator up to your
[159.54s -> 163.86s]  Platinum Star restaurant, Cook Serve Delicious, and reflected warmly upon your culinary brilliance
[163.86s -> 169.69s]  and magical powers, life was good. Without warning, police surrounded Sherry's Soda Tower.
[170.33s -> 173.53s]  It seemed company executives were siphoning funds from the corporation,
[174.49s -> 178.01s]  while at the same time incurring a staggering amount of debt which drained the accounts of
[178.01s -> 182.17s]  the tower and all the businesses inside. Everything was put up for federal auction.
[182.81s -> 191.14s]  Cook Serve Delicious was no more. Angry but determined to rebuild, you purchased a modest
[191.14s -> 196.58s]  commercial space on the 52nd floor of the Terrigan Tower, the largest skyscraper in the city,
[197.30s -> 204.89s]  packed with thousands of ravenous tenants. It is here that you will start a brand new Cook
[204.89s -> 209.45s]  Serve Delicious restaurant, build it back to its former glory, work at other restaurants to rebuild
[209.45s -> 214.25s]  your finances and expand your culinary knowledge and cement your legacy as the best chef in the
[214.25s -> 218.73s]  world. Good luck. I already am. That's what happened in Cook Serve Delicious 1. I became the best chef
[218.73s -> 228.02s]  in the world. So I already know what I'm doing. I already know kind of how to do this. But oh,
[228.02s -> 235.38s]  no, no, no, I don't need to click this. I already know how to do this stuff. But let's, you know
[235.38s -> 242.38s]  what, let's just do it. This is a relaxed stream. You're out of practice. That's true. Yeah,
[242.38s -> 247.53s]  there's the prep stations to your left, where orders appear as customers arrive. Enough talk,
[247.53s -> 251.93s]  enough talking. Let's cook. Select your order by clicking that order on the left or by pressing
[251.93s -> 259.94s]  one on your keyboard. All right. One hole in one nachos. Those are the ingredients. Yep. QSJV.
[260.82s -> 266.62s]  QSJV. Use the recipe on the bottom of the screen to place the correct ingredients ordered by the
[266.62s -> 273.46s]  customer. All right. So we've got queso cream beans. So that is queso cream beans. I did it in
[273.46s -> 283.51s]  a half a second and that's it. Press enter. Let's make it more complex stuff. I'm making a hamburger.
[284.70s -> 290.82s]  Place the ingredient and begin to cook. M is for meat patty. Two patties. Oh, those look good.
[291.54s -> 300.33s]  Those look good. That looks good. Okay, let's go. The meat is cooking. The white timer indicates
[300.33s -> 305.29s]  how long this food has left to cook. Once it turns blue, the food is ready to be prepped again.
[305.29s -> 311.93s]  Okay, so I just wait for it to turn blue. Blue. Select the order once it turns blue. Don't prep
[311.93s -> 319.42s]  it too early or the order will be raw. Okay, so let's prep it. This food has a greater number
[319.42s -> 326.58s]  of ingredients that spans two pages. Oh, don't make me do two pages. Ingredients have color boxes
[326.58s -> 337.00s]  to the left of them to easily show what page they are on. Oh, okay. So you press space. Press space.
[337.00s -> 345.58s]  Click the green space button or scroll the mouse wheel or press space. Good. So this person just
[345.58s -> 355.85s]  wants two meat patties and a regular bun. And a regular bun. All right. Done. All right, guys.
[355.85s -> 360.23s]  I gotta go. I'm gonna make one of these right now. I'm out of here. The bun looks wet. That's
[360.23s -> 364.66s]  no, that's good. You want the little drizzle of fucking oil on it. All right, so that's it.
[364.66s -> 368.66s]  Press space. Press enter. That's good. Done. And depending on how well you did, you'll get either
[368.66s -> 374.82s]  I'm in chat or I'm scared at something. Munkah S. Or you'll get like react harder, whichever one is
[375.62s -> 391.34s]  better. Yep. Perfect average of bad rating. Always strive for a perfect rating. Yeah. Wait,
[391.34s -> 398.57s]  there's holding stations in this one. Holding stations are the key to making things much easier
[398.57s -> 403.82s]  for you when a huge amount of customers walk through the door. In fact, if you don't utilize
[403.82s -> 409.18s]  them, the game can become quite difficult and sometimes impossible. Try accepting the order
[409.18s -> 415.50s]  on the left. You'll notice you cannot select this food. It has a red HS icon, meaning that it must
[415.50s -> 424.14s]  be prepared in a holding station before you can serve it. Let's do that now. Select holding
[424.14s -> 428.30s]  station one by clicking it or by pressing the button combination. In this case, hold down tab
[428.30s -> 437.35s]  and press one tab one. Oh Jesus. Select the pretzel and follow the recipe. The recipe will be
[437.35s -> 440.95s]  completely random each time you make food in the holding station. So pay close attention to make
[440.95s -> 447.83s]  sure it's done perfectly. Select a food to prep. Each page has a different category of food,
[447.83s -> 453.99s]  holding station, required foods, holding station, opera, operational, optional foods and side dishes.
[454.87s -> 464.38s]  Okay, so holding station, pretzel. We just want a German pretzel. Follow the recipe. Just German
[464.38s -> 473.00s]  pretzels. Get it in the oven. Just like the hamburger, we must wait until the food is finished
[473.00s -> 477.64s]  cooking before we can select it again. Holding stations are fully automated. Once the food is
[477.64s -> 481.64s]  finished cooking, it will... What did you fucking just say? I have to restart the whole game.
[481.64s -> 484.84s]  Pretzel is now in the holding station and ready to serve. Try selecting the pretzel in the prep
[485.32s -> 503.56s]  station. I got four in there. So that is ready. Oh, that's much better than the first game.
[504.44s -> 512.10s]  You actually get to put stuff and queue stuff up and have it made already. Now we're talking.
[512.74s -> 516.71s]  All right, one serving has been deducted from the holding station. You still have three more left to
[516.71s -> 520.71s]  serve to anyone coming and wanting pretzels. The food is going to decrease in freshness as the day
[520.71s -> 525.83s]  progresses. Once the clock runs out next to the serving number, food must be thrown away.
[527.02s -> 531.66s]  Certain things stay fresh or longer. All holding station orders must be cooked perfectly
[531.66s -> 534.30s]  or they cannot be served. Try serving these next three orders.
[538.70s -> 545.91s]  Dang. See how fast you can serve customers with holding stations? They're great. You've learned
[545.91s -> 549.43s]  the very basics of the game. However, there are still items such as side dishes, chores,
[549.43s -> 553.43s]  drinks, and holding station operational foods that you can learn in the extra tutorials. You
[553.43s -> 558.71s]  should absolutely check those out when you can. If you're ready to cook, hop into Max Wieners.
[559.35s -> 562.15s]  I heard they're looking for a good chef or spend your money over the food catalog and start
[562.15s -> 572.89s]  building your own menu and cook serve delicious too. Good luck from Mr. Risotto. Optional foods,
[572.89s -> 580.89s]  side dishes. You know, I need to do these. It's one minute. Holding station optional foods are
[580.89s -> 584.73s]  orders that can either be prepared in a prep station or made ahead of time in a holding station.
[585.29s -> 591.18s]  Okay, so let's make chicken nugget basket. I like these too.
[594.02s -> 603.06s]  Place the nuggets, dunk, and cook. Try to dunk. Is that it? Are they cooking?
[604.15s -> 608.90s]  Yeah, they are. They can be served when finished. Serve the order once it's ready.
[612.38s -> 617.08s]  Done. All right. Cool. Oh, I just want like a bunch of chicken nuggets and hamburgers and
[617.08s -> 622.41s]  shit right now. So you can make food beforehand. Select holding station one, then turn the page of
[622.41s -> 628.73s]  the holding station optional foods, and then select chicken nuggets. Okay. Select the food
[628.73s -> 636.42s]  to prep. There are no HS required foods on your menu. Okay, here's nuggets. So let's just make
[636.42s -> 653.24s]  them. So dunk them. How much should I make? Four. Okay. Nuggets are almost done. Now you have six
[653.24s -> 661.11s]  nuggets. Everybody could smell them. So they ran in. This is great for pre rush hour moments when
[661.11s -> 664.15s]  you feel you might have an influx of customers try serving all the customers that come in. I'll do
[664.15s -> 675.86s]  it as fast as I fucking can. Here we go. Ready? Nice. Beware optional foods take up space that
[675.86s -> 680.87s]  might be better used for side dishes or more holding station required foods. It'll be up to
[680.87s -> 692.78s]  you to find that perfect balance. I'm gonna fucking lose in the first level. I've already sprinted
[693.58s -> 698.90s]  to the side dishes. Customers won't wait for their orders for very long. As you can see,
[698.90s -> 703.78s]  this order that has arrived is quickly going off the screen. If it disappears completely,
[703.78s -> 708.74s]  it'll be counted as a bad order. You can see how long a customer will wait by the patience meter
[709.38s -> 718.98s]  measured in seconds. This meter will I'm training. This meter will drain as you make more and more
[718.98s -> 724.20s]  perfect foods and your buzz increases. Okay, so two seconds. To increase customer patience,
[724.20s -> 729.32s]  we must make side dishes. Select holding station one, turn the page of the side dishes and prepare.
[729.32s -> 737.54s]  Okay. Side dishes. So we make make a side salad with lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, croutons,
[737.54s -> 747.03s]  and cucumbers. Lettuce. That's it. That salad sucks. It was a terrible salad. It's just like
[747.03s -> 759.22s]  iceberg lettuce and like a bunch of shape. I wouldn't eat this. And then ATRU. Good. I got
[759.22s -> 765.43s]  five of these. So every unique side dish in your holding station, that's 15 seconds to the patience
[765.43s -> 774.10s]  meter. Don't act like you eat vegetables. I eat vegetables all the damn time. You can think I eat
[774.10s -> 784.86s]  vegetables. I don't act like you eat vegetables. For some reason, I don't think a lot of you guys
[784.86s -> 800.78s]  think I eat Captain Crunch and hamburger meat. No, I eat lots of stuff. I drink pineapple juice
[804.95s -> 810.31s]  and McChickens. Yeah, I got a steady diet of McChickens, Captain Crunch, whole milk,
[812.09s -> 821.86s]  and chicken nuggets. No, I am a I'm a fucking adult. I'm 33 years old. I have salads. I have
[822.74s -> 829.08s]  the good sources of protein. Like I don't even why am I explaining this? You guys already know all
[829.08s -> 835.42s]  this. One person said I eat like Captain Crunch every day and it freaked me out. Order a salad
[835.42s -> 843.24s]  right now. No, I don't want a salad right now. So I had a salad fucking like yesterday. All right,
[843.24s -> 849.75s]  I'm trying let me pay attention to the game. Every unique side dish in your holding station
[849.75s -> 854.79s]  has 15 seconds. Okay, you can have up to three unique sides on your menu, which can give you a
[854.79s -> 860.82s]  possible 45 extra seconds of patience. This is huge when you have a large influx of customers.
[861.54s -> 865.08s]  They will always order a random available side dish with their meal, which also increases your
[865.08s -> 869.96s]  income. Okay, so you have to have like a variety. Have at least one side dish in your holding station
[869.96s -> 875.22s]  as it's easy way to prevent walkouts and bad orders. I'm going to do a taste test on spring.
[875.86s -> 881.86s]  You can blindfold me. You put a bowl of Captain Crunch with crunch berries and then put a salad
[881.86s -> 892.10s]  on the other side. And I'll tell you, I'll do a taste test with a blindfold on. All right,
[892.10s -> 903.13s]  drinks and delicious. Drinks like side dish like goes out. Each drink item has a set number of
[903.13s -> 909.05s]  customers can be served to. I think I'm ready. Buzz cool moves. Keyboard users can fully remap
[909.05s -> 914.68s]  their keys for holding stations in key options. We should check out the options menu. Okay.
[916.09s -> 920.41s]  Practice chores. No, no, no. I don't need to practice chores. I don't have to drink out of
[920.41s -> 932.20s]  the toilet. Fs. Enter. Two is load the dishes. Begin washing the dishes. Wait with the green
[932.20s -> 939.93s]  light. Release. Unload. Sanitize. Go. Oh, I don't like. Wait, what's going on? Why is there a guy
[939.93s -> 959.96s]  with a gun? What? Okay. There's a fire. Hold on. Extinguish. There's a fire in the kitchen.
[961.16s -> 977.18s]  We can't use this. Rat traps. LCS. Toilet clean. Fs. Stop. What was the bug one? Work ticket. Please
[977.18s -> 1001.74s]  clean the pest light trap. Oh, trash. Oh, yeah. I remember the TMS. What? I don't have to mash?
[1002.62s -> 1011.08s]  Okay. Let's do the last one. This is bugs. Please set the roach traps. Set the trap. Sanitize.
[1012.12s -> 1018.52s]  And here's another robbery. So it's kick, kick, kick, kick, kick. All right. I get the idea.
[1019.32s -> 1030.39s]  Let's go. I know how to play. Food catalog, emails, designer, tutorials, tower.
[1032.39s -> 1035.83s]  It's an all-new campaign where you can run your cook, serve, delicious restaurant, or work in
[1035.83s -> 1041.35s]  other restaurants across the tower. Nailed perfect orders. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Getting yum
[1041.35s -> 1045.11s]  points. Gain enough yum points. You'll level up. Every fifth rank earns you half a star. Get a full
[1045.11s -> 1057.10s]  five-star restaurant. Be the best chef in the tower. Good luck. Standard shift. Oh, this all
[1057.10s -> 1066.79s]  looks good. I want one of these right now. I love this stuff so much. You know, I gotta tell you
[1066.79s -> 1073.78s]  that pretzels, a hot pretzel is probably the best snack you could ever eat. A big Bavarian pretzel
[1073.78s -> 1084.60s]  is just... I'm gonna have to get one. Okay, if I have a meeting later and I have like a big
[1084.60s -> 1099.53s]  Bavarian pretzel, is that not okay? Or should I just drink water? That's bad. What if I wanted
[1099.53s -> 1105.16s]  like two big Bavarian pretzels and like mustard and shit and just eat it and talk wicked fucking
[1105.16s -> 1120.84s]  loud while I'm chewing? All right, let's go. Standard shift. How do I say go? Oh, all right.
[1120.84s -> 1127.42s]  First time. Complete the day with fewer than eight bad orders. Complete day with fewer than five
[1127.42s -> 1133.18s]  average orders. Complete day perfectly. We're not gonna get that. Let's go. Prep any food to start
[1133.18s -> 1145.96s]  the day. Let's prep... Let's get the pretzels prepped. Let's prep corn dogs. So I need to do
[1145.96s -> 1156.49s]  bingo. Close it up. Cook it up. And hold on, hold on, hold on. I need... It's not ready yet.
[1157.45s -> 1165.18s]  Come on. I need to prep some other stuff too. Oh shit, you want something else? No, no, no, no,
[1165.18s -> 1169.26s]  back, back, back, back, back, back. No, no, no, no. Back up. How do I back up? No, just put the
[1169.26s -> 1181.45s]  fucking hot dogs on. No. What? What do you want on this? Ketchup? He's pissed. I hate these key
[1181.45s -> 1194.49s]  bindings already. All right, let's go. You want pretzel bun. You want a z and then onion mustard
[1194.49s -> 1205.74s]  ketchup. M, K, whiz, what? O, N, K, M. What do you got? Okay, I got it, I got it.
[1209.08s -> 1217.32s]  What do you want? What do you want? You want queso jalapenos beans. So that's Q, J, B. Corn dog.
[1217.32s -> 1226.46s]  You got it. What do you want? Ketchup. You got it. Toilet. What do you want? Flush it. I gotta prep
[1226.46s -> 1236.94s]  something else here. Let's prep a few hot dogs. Let's prep. Is that too many? This is too many,
[1236.94s -> 1244.33s]  I think. It's all right. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. There's too many hot
[1244.33s -> 1253.14s]  dogs. This is supposed to be a relaxing stream. Five. Hey, you want ketchup and mustard? Get out.
[1253.70s -> 1259.59s]  Get the fuck out of my restaurant. What just happened? What just happened? They just deleted.
[1260.15s -> 1273.93s]  Why did they delete? Why did they delete? What? What do you want? Open the ice base and fill it.
[1276.97s -> 1285.74s]  What? All right, hurry up. What do you want? Pretzel bun, mustard, P, no, Z, Z and then M.
[1286.95s -> 1295.82s]  Get out. Ah, you want pretzel bun, Z, and then ketchup and mustard. Do you want
[1296.62s -> 1307.77s]  shift? Tab four. Tab three, four. Tab three, four. I don't like this new. I don't like this one.
[1308.33s -> 1317.45s]  Premium bun, P, onions. Why the fuck is N onions? Why would you not make O onions?
[1319.78s -> 1335.40s]  No, shift. This is incorrect. Q, S. Am I deleting these? I am. Okay, so if you do it twice,
[1335.40s -> 1350.23s]  you delete them. C, S. I need something. I'm going out of business. Pretzel. I need. Okay.
[1351.43s -> 1359.11s]  Why is B pretzel? I've remapped this whole thing. Who's the insane person that decided that B
[1359.67s -> 1365.40s]  was going to be pretzel and not P? Who's the insane person that said N was going to be onions
[1365.40s -> 1376.62s]  and not O? Did you use a controller? Well, that's what I did last time. It wasn't a disaster.
[1379.48s -> 1395.78s]  Hold on. Just plug in. Really? Is it better? Are you feeling relaxed? Do not use a controller. Oh,
[1395.78s -> 1407.45s]  God. I don't know what to think. Hold on. It's better. It's better. It's better. Hold on. Let
[1407.45s -> 1418.71s]  me just plug it in. I might have to like restart it. Yeah, I'm quitting. I quit. Why are you not?
[1418.71s -> 1437.03s]  Let's go. There we go. Okay. Max wieners. Let's try this. You used to learn the keyboard without
[1437.03s -> 1440.49s]  looking at it. I can't. That's literally impossible. I've been using computers for
[1440.49s -> 1444.01s]  25 years and I don't know how to use the keys without looking at it. It's not going to happen.
[1444.01s -> 1449.74s]  It's impossible. It'll never happen, guys. I'm sorry. This is a thousand times easier, by the
[1449.74s -> 1461.00s]  way. Let's do pretzels. I like to hold it. Okay. We want German pretzel. Okay. Cook it up. How do
[1461.00s -> 1484.44s]  I do the second tab? Okay. Wiener. Is it L, B or something? All right. I got pretzels ready.
[1485.08s -> 1490.39s]  All right. What do you want? Premium bun. You want a premium bun and you want that's it. Nothing
[1490.39s -> 1494.55s]  else. Get out of here. Nobody want a corn dog. You don't want any corn dogs. You want everything
[1494.55s -> 1501.50s]  on this. There's a premium bun and then we got everything. We've got everything. Cheese, ketchup,
[1501.50s -> 1513.85s]  onions. Get out. Nobody wants a pretzel yet. Oh, I have to. Okay. I get it. Anybody else want
[1513.85s -> 1520.66s]  anything? How do I? Okay. You go. How do I select another station with the controller?
[1521.30s -> 1535.66s]  You want everything. You want, uh, no. You want queso helping his beans. How do I select them
[1535.66s -> 1546.87s]  out of a fucking station? Oh God. It's, it's just right on the D pad. Okay. Let's do, uh,
[1546.87s -> 1554.02s]  corn dogs. Let's put a fucking bunch of them in there. Close it up. Let's go. All right. What
[1554.02s -> 1568.58s]  do you want? No, this is bad. You want pretzels. I got a few of them left, right? All right. Here
[1568.58s -> 1576.12s]  we go. You want mustard on it. Mustard is X. What the fuck do you want? You want mustard is X.
[1576.12s -> 1582.68s]  What do you want? You want mustard is X. What do you want? You want, oh fuck. Oh my God. They're
[1582.68s -> 1589.06s]  burning. Okay. Regular bun and then everything else. Oh my God. This is so confusing.
[1594.49s -> 1610.54s]  What did I do wrong? Hold F trigger and what's wrong with this thing? Didn't I just do this?
[1611.18s -> 1624.94s]  I think I'm going to rage quit this game by the way. I don't think I want to play this.
[1627.29s -> 1631.29s]  This is so much more hectic than the first game by like a thousand times.
[1636.58s -> 1639.70s]  This isn't cook to serve delicious too. This is cook, serve delicious harder.
[1647.19s -> 1660.15s]  And then no, no, no, no, no. I went down wrong button. No, you got to prep the shit. It's just,
[1660.15s -> 1668.70s]  I'm so not used to doing that. I, I don't like the hold and left trigger. Give me the fucking
[1668.70s -> 1676.78s]  keyboard. No, that's not going to work. Why? Okay. Then left trigger Y, left trigger Y,
[1676.78s -> 1691.58s]  left trigger X holding and then go and a pretzel. Give it to the rats. He's not relaxing.
[1692.14s -> 1715.08s]  I've really not. What? What happened? Oh, catch up. What? What happened? I thought I had pretzels
[1715.08s -> 1729.59s]  here. What the fuck? It's too much for me. Then I already have, do they have, are these ones German?
[1730.63s -> 1869.67s]  I don't know. Are they German? Don't press Y again. Passive aggressive.
[1874.46s -> 1883.18s]  That's not passive aggressive. Yeah. I, I can't, my brain sucks. I can't play this one.
[1883.74s -> 1888.46s]  It's cool. I wish I could. I can't. I know I can't. I know I can't. You have to admit when you can't
[1888.46s -> 1896.41s]  do something. You know what I mean? I'm admitting I can't do it. Do the cash. I don't know. I can't
[1896.41s -> 1922.18s]  do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. You can do it. I can't do it. If you wanted to see cook,
[1922.18s -> 1926.42s]  serve delicious too, I was like, oh yeah, I can't wait. I just know I'm not going to like it.
[1926.42s -> 1930.74s]  I'm certain of it. I liked the first one. I can tell you,
[1930.74s -> 1936.49s]  I guarantee I'm not going to like it. Even if I lower the difficulty, I'm just, I'm just telling you.
