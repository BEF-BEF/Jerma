[1.40s -> 4.84s]  Digital Monsters, Digital Monsters, Digital Monsters.
[4.84s -> 13.53s]  Hey guys, welcome back to another edition of Digital Monsters.
[13.53s -> 23.43s]  I'm your guide. The emote is here. Yep, I've been hanging out in chat for like an hour or so.
[24.63s -> 32.63s]  Popping in and out, just popping my head in here. I was gonna hold off
[32.63s -> 38.55s]  and have a few more come out this next week, but I decided, you know, whatever.
[39.27s -> 47.22s]  Just put it out. I think it looks pretty good.
[52.86s -> 65.22s]  Ah, so today we're doing a extra stream. No, it's not even really extra.
[65.22s -> 73.98s]  Just another one in a row. Only had a small, you know, three to four hour, three and a half hour
[73.98s -> 82.18s]  stream on what was it now? A couple days ago. So I figured let's complete it and let's put,
[82.18s -> 88.23s]  you know, another three, four, five, six, however long. Just chill out with the MS-DOS
[89.56s -> 103.40s]  video game archive. There are 4,334 MS-DOS games on this website, first of all.
[103.96s -> 107.96s]  Second of all, it is you who will pick the games I will play.
[110.39s -> 113.99s]  Let's just make sure it works for the purpose of the stream.
[114.95s -> 119.96s]  Go ahead and start clicking on the screen. I want to make sure it still works
[121.42s -> 134.23s]  and it does, doesn't it? This is going to be a smart click stream. Now, is there a way?
[136.18s -> 142.58s]  All right, so do me a favor. Get like all four corners. You know, go like top left,
[142.58s -> 149.45s]  top right as far as you can go. Give me some corners here. All right, so top and top right
[150.50s -> 155.30s]  and top left work fine, but it's just not that bottom area. I wonder why that is.
[156.26s -> 161.75s]  There's nothing really I can change about it either. Should be okay though.
[165.51s -> 168.71s]  Get out your laptops, mobile users. Yeah, this should just be fun.
[170.62s -> 181.48s]  Just wanted to do it. Sam and Max will return this coming week here.
[181.48s -> 188.94s]  Let me take a look at my calendar. It's like that because of the Twitch UI for full
[188.94s -> 198.06s]  screening. I see. I still remember you calling me an asshole yesterday. No, I was just
[198.06s -> 205.29s]  fucking around. I was a little hangry last night. I'm sorry. I was hungry and annoyed.
[206.33s -> 211.32s]  I was hangry. I was. Only at the very, very end though. I don't know. It just kind of
[211.32s -> 222.65s]  clicked in there. What happened? Nothing happened. I was just being, I was just,
[222.65s -> 228.34s]  I was irritated because I don't know. I got, I'm just a human, all right?
[228.34s -> 233.02s]  And sometimes you get irritated. Maybe you should eat some food,
[233.02s -> 236.14s]  asshole. See, somebody called me an asshole. I can't, what am I supposed to do?
[237.82s -> 256.10s]  No, I'm just kidding. No, no, no, no, no, no. Smart clicks work. To be fair chat can be,
[256.10s -> 262.68s]  no, all I did, I was responding. Somebody said that this stream today was going to,
[262.68s -> 270.10s]  was going to be a shitty idea. And I said, Hey, Hey, that's it. I didn't say anything else.
[272.71s -> 278.70s]  That was, that was it. It's a new day though. You know, if you give up a home run,
[279.42s -> 291.35s]  you don't think about that home run every single time you play. You gotta get struck out sometimes.
[291.91s -> 294.68s]  Well, the pitcher doesn't get struck out unless you're playing in the national league.
[296.57s -> 300.58s]  Think about that home run. But all right, let's, uh, let's get going.
[304.55s -> 308.55s]  Just be funny. No, that's not forehead. No, it's not. Do not, no,
[308.55s -> 311.91s]  germapop is not intended to be used as a forehead. It's intended to be used as an
[311.91s -> 321.75s]  ice cream to eat and enjoy. Oh, great. So here, this is how it's going to work.
[321.75s -> 327.51s]  Let me turn off this for a second here. Will we get in a minute? Okay. So let me make sure
[327.51s -> 336.49s]  this is on correctly. It should be. And as you see here, would you look at that? Here are
[337.53s -> 347.37s]  some of the thousands of video games that are on here. So very important. First little tidbit
[347.37s -> 358.31s]  of information here is the reason why it looks like this is because this area here is if you
[358.31s -> 366.86s]  want me to scroll. This is the archive. From my understanding, and this was a recommendation,
[366.86s -> 372.42s]  by the way, from my understanding, all this stuff is like abandoned vaporware on like the
[372.42s -> 382.09s]  archive website. It's on like archive.org. I think this is, this is all like kind of
[382.97s -> 389.24s]  shit that doesn't, like doesn't exist anymore. How about this? Anything that's like still
[389.24s -> 395.77s]  copywritten, I won't play. So, okay, here's your criteria. Everyone gets to pick. You guys
[395.77s -> 403.61s]  get to pick what I do today. No copyright stuff, no porn games, no games that are rated R,
[403.61s -> 408.81s]  no games that require anything to do with a mouse, and no games that have loud sounds.
[408.81s -> 415.54s]  So you've got to pick wisely here because I don't want to get in trouble. So out of
[415.54s -> 422.49s]  this four level, how many? 4,000, this 4,334, you probably have a choice of between like
[422.49s -> 430.06s]  maybe 40 different games. But the reason why this is down here is because I'm going to
[430.06s -> 434.94s]  just start at the top here. And by the way, I get full veto. So if you're going to want
[434.94s -> 440.06s]  me to play like Sim City illegally, I'm going to have to veto that one. I'm just going to
[440.06s -> 445.18s]  have to do that. If you want me to play, for instance, Stunts, I'm going to have to veto
[445.18s -> 453.75s]  that one too. This is copyrighted. I'm just kidding. It's not illegal. It's very illegal.
[453.75s -> 459.00s]  Because I don't want to be like on an illegal stream. Any Twitch staff in here?
[459.00s -> 469.61s]  Any Twitch staff in here that tell me this is like illegal? This is all puppetsarchive.org.
[472.55s -> 479.94s]  You got like Aladdin. Oh, well, the new movie's coming out, right? It's a game library. Yeah,
[479.94s -> 486.26s]  it's at archive.org public game library. Well, let's put it this way. If like Twitch
[486.26s -> 491.06s]  staff comes in here and says, get out of here, I'll be like, all right, man.
[493.29s -> 496.49s]  And then we'll pack it up and go to a different streaming website for like an hour.
[497.86s -> 505.74s]  I'm kidding. That's a joke. Don't, nobody hold that on me. All right. So remember if
[505.74s -> 510.54s]  you let's get started. If you want me to scroll, it's an infinite scroll, by the way.
[513.35s -> 518.71s]  This is already off limits. I'm not going to play a porn game. So don't click that one.
[520.02s -> 527.22s]  Here we go. Please click on the thing if you want me to scroll down. And by the way,
[527.22s -> 535.02s]  a scroll down means all of it. I'm scrolling down here. So if you want that scroll,
[535.02s -> 544.50s]  you better know that's what you want. You know how this is going to end. Not yet. I don't.
[544.50s -> 551.27s]  Please click the screen on the thing you'd like me to play. All right. Already vetoed the porn
[551.27s -> 568.57s]  game. It's not porn. It's a porn game. This game starts off at porn. It's a porn start.
[568.57s -> 574.30s]  It's a porn start. It really isn't. I don't know. It could be a porn game.
[574.30s -> 585.54s]  Can you guys not click over here? You should be able to click on the right side.
[585.54s -> 594.70s]  No, you can't. I'm getting baited. Yeah. See, if you want me to scroll,
[594.70s -> 601.50s]  you click over there. Make sure you click on the same spot because I have to do addition.
[601.50s -> 606.89s]  All right. So now that we know the rules, now that you know the rules, we're going to do it.
[606.89s -> 613.72s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, slow down. Add an arrow icon. All right. Yeah,
[613.72s -> 619.58s]  that's a good idea. You know, when people just think of good ideas, I love it. So let's add
[619.58s -> 626.98s]  like a down arrow that you have to click on. Well, I'm just going to put like a circle
[626.98s -> 634.90s]  or something. Look, how about I just put the popsicle up there. Put a down vote. No,
[634.90s -> 651.16s]  no, no. All right. If you want to scroll, click on the pop, the new emote. This is where you need
[651.16s -> 662.89s]  to click if you want to scroll down. All right. Here we go. And play elevator music. That's too
[662.89s -> 674.92s]  much for me. How are new viewers going to know that? They, you know what? They won't.
[674.92s -> 682.60s]  You're right. I'm still lost. Wait, why is it covering up the, hold on a second. There we go.
[682.60s -> 690.01s]  Okay. You want me to scroll? No, everybody just clicked it because I put the face up
[690.01s -> 697.67s]  there. You don't actually want me to scroll. It's just, it's just like bugs to a light.
[697.67s -> 718.09s]  It's like, oh shit, click a face. Only click once. We want ice cream. Oh shit. At least
[718.09s -> 729.22s]  the bug lights are working. Well, it looks like we're going to do the Oregon trail.
[729.22s -> 731.62s]  And I kind of knew that was going to be what we were going to do at first.
[734.15s -> 744.20s]  I figured that's what we were going to do. Oregon trail it is. So here we go. Let's do
[744.28s -> 751.42s]  the Oregon trail. It might be loud and I apologize in advance if it is. Here we go.
[758.30s -> 763.26s]  Don't worry. I've got it set up so I can do this. Hey, should I gotta get the image off
[763.26s -> 770.25s]  the screen? No fuck. I can't get them off the screen. All right. Here we go.
[771.94s -> 779.02s]  I'll copyright 1990. I'm fucked. Just keep, I have to keep them there for the first month.
[779.75s -> 783.75s]  You may travel the trail, learn about the trail, see the Oregon top 10, turn sound off,
[783.75s -> 787.27s]  choose management option. What is N? What is your option? Choose the trail. Travel the trail.
[789.03s -> 795.80s]  So how many, many kinds of people made the trip to Oregon. You may be a banker from Boston.
[796.90s -> 801.78s]  Yeah, I mean that's the easy one though. These are difficulty settings. Be a carpenter
[801.78s -> 806.82s]  from Ohio. Be a farmer from Illinois. Find out the differences between these choices. I
[806.82s -> 810.82s]  know that the banker just gets the most money and I gotta be, it says Boston. I have to
[810.82s -> 821.22s]  click it. What is the first name of the wagon leader? What are the first names of the
[821.22s -> 834.76s]  four other members in your party? All the people that are like in this house.
[837.88s -> 850.18s]  Did you get my multiple split personality? My roommate, my girlfriend, and my dog. Yeah,
[850.18s -> 866.55s]  these are correct. Do you sleep with Jax in the same bed? Yes, it's me. It is 1848.
[866.55s -> 872.63s]  Your jumping off place for Oregon is Independence, Missouri. You must decide which month to
[872.63s -> 879.35s]  leave Independence. It's gonna be too hot in July. It'll be a little too rainy for me in April.
[880.73s -> 887.48s]  May bugs come out. We're going in March. Before leaving Independence, you should buy equipment
[887.48s -> 893.00s]  and supplies. You have 1600 bits in cash, but you don't have to spend it all now.
[893.56s -> 901.21s]  Okay, 1600 bucks. You can buy whatever you need at Matt's General Store. Hello, I'm Matt.
[901.21s -> 905.61s]  So you're going to Oregon. I can fix you up with what you need. A team of oxen to pull
[905.61s -> 912.07s]  your wagon. Clothing for both summer and winter. Excellent. Plenty of food for the trip. Ammunition
[912.07s -> 918.20s]  for your rifles and spare parts for your wagon. Matt's General Store. Okay, oxen. Total bill
[918.20s -> 924.46s]  zero. Amount you have. Which item would you like to buy? I eat a lot, so let's make sure
[924.46s -> 930.33s]  we get some food here. I recommend you take at least 200 pounds of food for each person
[930.33s -> 934.73s]  in your family. I see that you have five people in all. You'll need flour, sugar,
[934.73s -> 939.05s]  bacon, and coffee. My price is 20 cents a pound. How many pounds of food do you want?
[940.63s -> 946.95s]  Oh, god damn it. This is one of those math problems. If Judy eats 400 pounds of bacon
[948.14s -> 954.38s]  and Kim eats 200 pounds of sugar, how many pounds of bacon will it take to make one
[954.38s -> 963.10s]  bag of flour? I don't fucking know. Let's go with like 5,000 pounds. No, how many? Two, four,
[963.10s -> 969.66s]  six, eight, a thousand? I eat a lot. I eat like, okay, I eat like six times a day.
[969.66s -> 977.69s]  You wonder why I get so hangry. My body is just burning calories constantly. I can't stop it,
[977.69s -> 985.88s]  no matter what I do. When I'm lying in bed, my body is just like 400 degrees. Kim will roll
[985.88s -> 991.32s]  over to me and be like, god, you are like a fireball. And I'm just like sweating like, what?
[992.12s -> 996.44s]  Oh, sorry. And I'll turn over and Jax will be on the other side and he'll be like,
[996.44s -> 1001.00s]  I don't see the problem. I think you're a little cold actually. Because he's like
[1001.00s -> 1014.26s]  30,000 degrees hotter than I am. So, okay, we need a thousand pounds. But I eat more,
[1014.26s -> 1019.70s]  so I'm gonna get 1200 pounds. Like, I eat for two, you know, like a pregnant guy.
[1022.82s -> 1031.77s]  Food, 200, total bill 240. Oxen. There are two oxen in a yolk. I recommend at least three
[1031.77s -> 1038.25s]  yolk. I charge $40 a yolk. See, it's doing, this is like children's math. Okay, I need
[1038.25s -> 1050.92s]  three, so two, four, six, six oxens. How many yolk do you want? More, right? Anytime you
[1050.92s -> 1058.68s]  recommend, I want four. Four or five? I'm gonna do five. Clothing. You'll need warm clothing
[1058.68s -> 1062.44s]  in the mountains. I recommend taking at least two sets of each clothes per person.
[1064.36s -> 1069.91s]  Each set is 10 bucks. I don't trust this matte person. Why? Because he looks like
[1069.91s -> 1080.06s]  the old version of the ice cream that is on the screen right now. I mean, that's weird,
[1080.22s -> 1098.94s]  I guess. Because he vapes. That's a pipe. You're getting scammed. I'm not getting scammed yet. I
[1098.94s -> 1103.58s]  haven't signed the check. Okay, you need warm clothes in the mountains. I recommend taking
[1103.58s -> 1111.30s]  at least two sets of clothes per person. So, 10 sets of clothes. Let's go with 12 sets of
[1111.30s -> 1119.32s]  clothes. I'm a banker. I got a lot of money. Okay, ammunition. I sell ammunition in boxes of
[1119.32s -> 1123.48s]  20 bullets. Each box costs two bucks. How many boxes do you want? A lot. Because you
[1123.48s -> 1135.88s]  have to like shoot squirrels and stuff and bugs. I'm gonna say like five boxes. Okay,
[1136.84s -> 1145.90s]  maybe try to get more than that. Hold on. That was only 10 bucks. I want 10 boxes. Okay,
[1145.90s -> 1150.44s]  spare parts. It's a good idea to have a few spare parts for your wagon. Here are the
[1150.44s -> 1155.42s]  prices. Wagon wheel, wagon axle, wagon tongue. You have a lot more money. Yeah,
[1155.42s -> 1160.42s]  because I need to invest it. I don't want to spend every single cent that I own. It's all
[1160.42s -> 1163.94s]  the money that I have. I want to invest it into fucking, I don't know, I'm gonna put like
[1163.94s -> 1173.30s]  a call option on Tesla to expire. Hopefully, hopefully in the money in like two or three
[1173.30s -> 1183.86s]  weeks. I'm an investment. I'm playing the part. What do you come on? All right, I want
[1183.86s -> 1190.63s]  how many wagon wheels do you want? I want 12. No, that's too many. Wagon wheel. It's
[1190.63s -> 1197.29s]  a good idea to have a few spare parts. A few. Five. Your wagon may only carry three
[1197.29s -> 1205.10s]  wagon wheels. That's bullshit. I got 500 bucks. I want another wagon. Buy another wagon.
[1206.20s -> 1211.56s]  Three. Can I do five axles? All right, what was gonna do the max? Three, three, three.
[1212.74s -> 1218.10s]  Total bill. Okay, I have like a thousand dollars left. Should I buy more? Should I buy more
[1219.54s -> 1228.47s]  animals? The wagon has too much stuff. Everyone's gonna have to walk. All right,
[1228.47s -> 1233.96s]  I'm gonna buy some more. I'm gonna buy five more of oxen. No, no, no, no, no. Okay,
[1233.96s -> 1245.66s]  that's not adding. That's total. I'm gonna six yolks. Ammo. How many boxes do I want?
[1247.46s -> 1255.27s]  Let's go with like 20 boxes. More than that. Let's go with 100 boxes. It can't
[1255.27s -> 1262.38s]  even count that high. 50 boxes. All right, now what about clothes? Maybe some extra
[1262.46s -> 1278.46s]  clothes. Um, 10. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Um, 20. That's less. Oxen. All right,
[1278.46s -> 1285.96s]  how about like 20? 15. 15. It won't let me buy more. I can only do single digits.
[1285.96s -> 1302.82s]  Eight. There we go. I think we're good to go. More food. No, I don't need more food.
[1302.82s -> 1308.02s]  How many pounds was it? 2,000 pounds. All right, that's 2,000 pounds of food.
[1308.94s -> 1318.68s]  More ammo. More ammo. All right, I'm gonna say 75 boxes. More clothes. I guess I'll do a couple
[1318.68s -> 1335.08s]  more clothes. 30? Less oxen. Okay, I guess I'll. Well then, you're ready to start. Good luck.
[1335.08s -> 1341.46s]  You have a long and difficult journey ahead of you. Okay. I knew there was sounds. That's
[1341.46s -> 1348.34s]  very, that's very loud for me. Hope it's not loud for you. Uh, independent. March 1st,
[1348.42s -> 1357.53s]  1848. Which one of them is me? Oh, look, there's Otto. Oh, like, I know what you guys are gonna
[1357.53s -> 1384.14s]  say. It's cold. Health good. Pace steady. Rations filling. You may continue on trail.
[1384.14s -> 1388.38s]  Check supplies. Look at the map. Change pace. Stop to rest. Let's just go on the trail.
[1388.94s -> 1398.82s]  Talk to people. Let's go. From Independence, it is 102 miles to the Kansas River crossing date.
[1398.82s -> 1403.78s]  It's cold. Let's go. Press enter to size up the situation. What do you mean,
[1403.78s -> 1409.34s]  size up the situation? What are we talking about, like MTV's? It wasn't gonna knock me
[1409.34s -> 1412.06s]  out? Size them up? You wanna come, you wanna come, come at me? You wanna come at me?
[1412.06s -> 1416.73s]  Situation? That was pretty good. I liked that one. I don't care if you didn't. I liked it.
[1418.33s -> 1422.17s]  Press enter to size up the situation. Severe blizzard. Lose one day.
[1425.69s -> 1438.31s]  Hmm. What do we got for supplies? 16 oxen. 1,500 bullets. How do we already eat 50 pounds of food
[1438.31s -> 1453.53s]  in one day? We're good. Cold. Health good. Food. Severe blizzard. Lose a day. Go. What I used
[1453.53s -> 1458.01s]  to do in math class is I would change it to the fastest you could possibly run and skip
[1458.01s -> 1463.67s]  every single scenario and I could never get to the end and I never knew why. Press enter the
[1464.15s -> 1469.83s]  size it up a little bit. Rations, filling. Let's, hold on. No, no, no. No, everyone's not just
[1469.83s -> 1474.31s]  gonna eat and fucking scrape a bunch of potatoes and carrots into the trash. That's not gonna
[1474.31s -> 1481.80s]  happen. Okay, filling meals are large and generous. No. Meals are small but adequate.
[1481.80s -> 1493.58s]  Let's go with two. Okay, change pace. A grueling pace. I always love to do grueling
[1493.58s -> 1503.03s]  pace. Only for like a few minutes though. Not that long. All right, let's go continue on
[1503.03s -> 1515.24s]  the trail. Snowbound. Lose nine days. Did we go, is it an avalanche? Go. You are now at the
[1515.24s -> 1532.02s]  Kansas River crossing. Would you like to look around? Yes. I can't do this one. Sorry. It's
[1532.02s -> 1543.59s]  pretty nice. All right, Kansas River crossing. Talk to people. Is anybody around? A stranger
[1543.59s -> 1550.15s]  tells you, can't afford to take a ferry. We're making our wagon into a boat. We'll turn it
[1550.23s -> 1556.71s]  over, cock the bottom and sides with pitch and use it to float our goods across. After swim the
[1556.71s -> 1570.04s]  animals. Hope it don't rain. The river's high enough. Okay. Anybody to trade with. You meet
[1570.04s -> 1576.68s]  another emigrant who wants one set of clothing. He will trade you 76 bullets. Are you willing
[1576.68s -> 1591.24s]  to trade? No. 76 bullets. That's bad. Let me check the supplies. We're good. I got plenty
[1591.24s -> 1597.34s]  of food. I got some money. Let's continue on the trail. You must cross the river in order to
[1597.34s -> 1603.98s]  continue. The river at this point is currently 613 feet across and 2.8 feet deep in the middle.
[1603.98s -> 1611.99s]  All right, so it's almost three feet deep and it's 600 feet. Three feet deep. It's cold
[1611.99s -> 1616.23s]  though. You may attempt to ford the river. Cock the wagon and float it across. Take a
[1616.23s -> 1620.23s]  ferry across. Wait to see if conditions improve. Get more information. We're gonna take a ferry.
[1620.23s -> 1624.23s]  Take the ferry. The ferry operator says that he will charge you five dollars
[1624.79s -> 1632.38s]  and you'll have to wait four days. Five dollars. That's it? Are you serious? Pay the premium
[1632.38s -> 1646.86s]  every time. That's five bucks. Oh yes, we're going. Look at all them swimming over there.
[1649.98s -> 1654.34s]  Hey, sorry. We're just trying to go the speed limit over here.
[1656.42s -> 1661.45s]  Get me more cigarettes and coffee and chocolate on my fucking massive
[1661.45s -> 1685.16s]  mansion boat. There's only six football fields. He's rich. Who's the guy on the right?
[1691.94s -> 1696.18s]  I forgot he was there. All right, from the Kansas River it is 82 miles to the big blue
[1696.18s -> 1704.09s]  river crossing. Health good. Weather warm. Food plenty of food. Grueling. We're good.
[1704.65s -> 1709.82s]  Everything's fine. You are now at the big blue river crossing. Would you like to look around?
[1709.82s -> 1728.12s]  Yeah, let's get another song. Um, ma'am, I'm not entirely sure. As a doctor that's been in this
[1729.27s -> 1733.99s]  field for over 35 years, we've never had somebody hooked up to a machine
[1734.63s -> 1737.67s]  we thought was gonna die real soon and then this shit started happening.
[1740.76s -> 1744.12s]  Just gotta get your camera out and Snapchat it. This is unbelievable.
[1744.12s -> 1762.74s]  So we got check supplies. Let's see how we're doing. Snapchat is the most boomer thing
[1762.74s -> 1767.78s]  you've ever said. Why? You guys don't like Snapchat? I haven't used it in a while.
[1768.50s -> 1773.29s]  All right, we're good. Uh, I would like to continue on the trail. Everyone's fine.
[1774.01s -> 1778.25s]  You must cross the river in order to continue. The river is at this point is currently 248 feet
[1778.25s -> 1790.54s]  across and five feet deep in the middle. Uh, I would attempt. Where's the ferry? I can't pay.
[1790.54s -> 1794.55s]  I don't, I don't want to go in there. Excuse me, I don't want to go in the water.
[1796.04s -> 1801.14s]  No, my things will get wet. Where's the ferry? Excuse me, ferry to take me across?
[1801.78s -> 1806.57s]  And this is the part of the TV show or the movie where all the people I laughed at
[1807.38s -> 1810.82s]  are walking by me now and are looking and like scoffing like,
[1812.26s -> 1815.70s]  he's got to do it this way now. And I'm like, no, I can't. I don't think I can.
[1819.94s -> 1832.55s]  Uh, how much is, let's see. He's role playing in the Oregon trail. Yes, I am.
[1832.55s -> 1835.83s]  I'm not going to forward the river. We're going to cock the wagon and float across.
[1838.01s -> 1840.81s]  We're going to turn into like fucking bread box.
[1840.97s -> 1868.41s]  No. Okay. I'm dead. The way I get tipped over while floating, you lose 25 sets of clothing.
[1868.41s -> 1873.06s]  What did I have all the shirts on? Three, well, all right, hold on a minute. This doesn't
[1873.06s -> 1878.17s]  make any sense. Was I just hoarding all the t-shirts? Would I do it in like a t-shirt
[1878.25s -> 1882.12s]  challenge video? And then the fucking boat tipped over?
[1891.32s -> 1898.95s]  That's why I drowned in four foot deep water. It wasn't even, no, it was less than that. It
[1898.95s -> 1906.01s]  was like four, it was like three and a half. I was way down by cinder blocks apparently. Okay.
[1906.81s -> 1910.97s]  Whatever. I don't need to be alive as long as one of me is alive. I don't care.
[1912.30s -> 1919.45s]  Oh, that's unfucking believable. All right. It's 118 miles to Fort Kearney. Let's go.
[1919.45s -> 1924.25s]  Lose trail. See, no, you don't have me here. So I was good at navigating.
[1925.05s -> 1927.96s]  All right. Let's, people can eat now because I eat way too much.
[1929.13s -> 1932.57s]  So now I can increase the food because I'm not around to eat at all
[1932.57s -> 1938.17s]  and do a YouTube challenge videos and then drown myself with 25 different t-shirts on.
[1944.92s -> 1950.71s]  Change food. Let's go filling. Pays can stay at grueling because that's what we're going to do.
[1952.79s -> 1961.26s]  Continue on the trail. Let's go. Press enter. Now we're good. Cool. Health is fair. Why?
[1961.26s -> 1976.76s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Why is health fair? What's wrong? Oh, I'm not even close.
[1986.79s -> 1993.03s]  Okay. Let's just get to Fort. Let's get to Fort Monopoly. Ah, shit. I gotta pay this guy
[1994.33s -> 1998.81s]  60 bucks. He's got a hotel on here already. Fort Kearney, what's that worth?
[1999.45s -> 2004.63s]  Here, now at Fort Kearney, would you like to look around? Yes, I would.
[2014.50s -> 2019.78s]  You died in your, you literally died in your neighbor's yard. No, I died in my neighbor's
[2019.78s -> 2037.32s]  pool. Why did I have to drown? All right. Let's check the supplies. I got, I only have five
[2037.32s -> 2043.43s]  sets of clothing. I have to get something. I have to trade. Attempt to trade. Can I,
[2043.43s -> 2049.26s]  can anybody have any clothes? You meet another immigrant who wants one wagon axle. You don't
[2049.26s -> 2056.90s]  have this. Yeah, because I dragged it all down with me. Buy supplies. Okay. How much money do
[2056.90s -> 2062.90s]  we have? You have $335 clothing. $12 per set. What's this fucking premium bullshit?
[2063.62s -> 2085.66s]  A couple, one, like two, three more, four more. Okay. No more. I need, I need axles too.
[2085.66s -> 2092.26s]  God damn it. How much are they? Did I lose anything else?
[2103.75s -> 2109.40s]  Check supplies, axles, guts, clothes. Now I've got plenty of bullets. Nobody knows how to use a
[2109.40s -> 2117.24s]  gun in this troop. How many, anybody know how to use a gun? No, no, no, no, no. Oh, let's
[2117.24s -> 2126.87s]  take 1500 bullets. No, Jax doesn't know how to use a gun. Jax only knows how to use pretend
[2126.87s -> 2137.90s]  guns. He's a video game star. Okay. I think we're good. I'm going to stop to rest though.
[2138.54s -> 2143.53s]  At least get, like bury me. Am I, what am I? We'll put, at least put something somewhere to
[2143.53s -> 2156.22s]  remember me. Uh, how many, okay. We'll take one day off. Okay. It is 250 miles to Chimney Rock.
[2156.86s -> 2168.44s]  Cool. Health is fair. Got plenty of food. You're still floating in your neighbor's pool.
[2168.44s -> 2173.93s]  Wrong trail again. I wouldn't have done this. Somebody's stress eating because they lost the
[2173.93s -> 2186.33s]  trail. Who is it? Oh, we're going to get to a stump. I don't even feel invested anymore.
[2186.33s -> 2203.85s]  I don't even feel involved anymore. Yes, I would. Happy new year, everybody. It's April 18th. Why
[2203.85s -> 2226.15s]  would they play this song? I would accept like, like December 31st, 1848. I can't,
[2226.15s -> 2232.94s]  I can't get out of this. Okay guys, I can. I'm going to, I'm going to change the pace.
[2233.50s -> 2238.09s]  We're going to go, we're going to do strenuous. Let's take a look at the map.
[2238.65s -> 2251.54s]  Okay. Your route, rivers, mountains, land marks forts. Okay, let's keep going. It is 86 miles to
[2251.54s -> 2263.26s]  Fort Laramie. Yes. Severe blizzard. That's okay. It's snowy. We can make it. Don't need to size
[2263.26s -> 2267.42s]  it up. I got plenty of food. I was corrected by you. Pass a gravesite. Would you like to
[2267.42s -> 2271.58s]  look closer? Yes, I would because I would like to be buried here. I would like to at
[2271.58s -> 2281.13s]  least remember I told you here lies. Uh, can we just like, we just like put me on there too.
[2281.69s -> 2297.18s]  Hey, hey, hey, come out and play. Am I supposed to know who that is?
[2297.90s -> 2304.76s]  You are now at Fort Laramie. Would you like to look around? Uh-huh.
[2313.45s -> 2324.95s]  That's just a baby toy that plays random songs. Oh, it comes with four songs. Uh,
[2324.95s -> 2334.42s]  how are we doing? Let me check my supplies again. I got plenty of bolts. I got some
[2334.42s -> 2341.19s]  money left. Pounds of food. We're good. We're good. 190 miles to Independence Rock.
[2344.10s -> 2351.02s]  Severe blizzard again. Weather warm. Interesting. Now, as sure this isn't like ash coming from
[2351.02s -> 2372.09s]  a volcano. Fair health. Fair warm. Fair. Here comes the rock. Get there. Come on.
[2372.65s -> 2383.86s]  You are now at Independence Rock. I would love to look around. May 5th.
[2386.34s -> 2394.50s]  If you smell. All right. Let's, uh, talk to somebody. Uh, Big Louie tells you.
[2395.30s -> 2401.70s]  Goodbye, Platte River. Goodbye, Sandy Hills and White Buffalo Sculls. Now we climb the
[2401.70s -> 2407.94s]  Sweetwater Valley to cross the continental divide and self-pass. Once across the Rockies,
[2407.94s -> 2426.58s]  we'll make a steep descent into the Green River Valley. Find wild fruit. Do I find it?
[2426.58s -> 2435.91s]  Size it up. Hunt for fruit. Enter key to start or stop walking. Point the rifle.
[2437.86s -> 2442.02s]  Novice hunters to point the rifle expert hunters and space bars fire.
[2442.58s -> 2469.75s]  Well, I'm a novice hunter, so yeah, I told you you shoot squirrels. Oh,
[2469.75s -> 2483.83s]  fuck. That squirrel was coming for blood from the animals you shot. Got 923 pounds of meat.
[2486.18s -> 2507.83s]  What? How big was that buffalo? Was that buffalo as big as a car?
[2507.83s -> 2513.27s]  Buffaloes are huge. Holy shit. I, I don't know why that I can only carry a hundred pounds.
[2513.27s -> 2524.12s]  Who cares? Actually, yeah, they are. They are huge. Aren't they? That just seemed like such
[2524.12s -> 2532.01s]  an enormous, unbelievable number. This is what happens when you live in this current day and
[2532.09s -> 2543.96s]  age. That's sad. I did not believe that for a whole 10 seconds. 900 pounds of meat. Click
[2543.96s -> 2550.25s]  this link, link, link. Hold on. What do you mean? Hold on. First of all, I can't, my mouse is
[2550.25s -> 2567.46s]  locked in. At least I got, did the video, did I public the video? That's fucking fast.
[2577.51s -> 2580.87s]  No, I died. Well, hopefully someone will public my t-shirt challenge.
[2581.51s -> 2589.24s]  All right. Continue on the trail. I can't believe I only have, which rock is this one?
[2589.88s -> 2609.40s]  You are now at South Pass. Let's look around. Did they talk about me when I'm gone? Do you
[2609.40s -> 2622.41s]  think? Plenty of clothes. Look at the map. I'm getting there. I'm going to get there. I'm
[2622.41s -> 2633.18s]  going to get to the whole of Oregon. Talk to people. A young girl tells you. My father is
[2633.18s -> 2638.38s]  very sick and we are resting here until he gets better. We have been pushing too hard
[2638.38s -> 2643.02s]  and our health has suffered. When my father is able to travel again, we will go at a slow
[2643.02s -> 2659.67s]  pace. Sorry. My father was fairly wealthy. That was the Otto voice. No. Hi everyone,
[2659.67s -> 2664.55s]  this is Otto. That's the Otto voice. That was, I just, no, that was Otto. Yeah,
[2664.55s -> 2669.85s]  that was Otto whispering. You were right. And you know, every voice of the, hey,
[2669.85s -> 2687.82s]  Germa quotes four voices, quote Elberton. Otto's cousin. The trail divides here. You
[2687.82s -> 2693.34s]  may head for green river crossing, head for Fort Bridger, see the map. Let's take a look.
[2696.18s -> 2708.76s]  This is our first ever choice. What's the, how do I go to straight as hard as possible?
[2708.76s -> 2723.37s]  It's not Fort Bridger. We're going straight as far, as fast as I can. Let you guys vote.
[2725.64s -> 2744.34s]  Okay. Hold on. Okay. Let's you guys can vote. Don't do it yet. I said, don't do it yet.
[2745.08s -> 2753.21s]  Don't do it yet. You have to wait cause I have to switch between like three screens. Stop it.
[2753.21s -> 2766.76s]  Okay. Don't wait. Stop. Here we go. Ready? Don't do it yet. Don't do it yet. Hold on.
[2767.72s -> 2776.78s]  Don't do it yet. Do it now. You see I have to wait cause I have to get it like squared up.
[2776.78s -> 2786.30s]  How the fuck am I ever going to know when you're clicking on? No, this is not going
[2786.30s -> 2797.94s]  to work. Hmm. I think they're clicking on one, two or three. I can't zoom in because my
[2797.94s -> 2802.42s]  mouse is locked in the emulator. So I have to stay here. If I hit escape,
[2802.42s -> 2808.42s]  I pull out and it screws the whole thing up. It looks, it let, that looks like one to me.
[2808.42s -> 2814.90s]  That's one. All right. Thanks for voting. Hold on. Let me get like this off. I have to hit
[2814.90s -> 2822.33s]  the BRB. Thanks for pointing. A straw poll would just be easier. Yeah, it probably would.
[2824.28s -> 2828.49s]  Okay. We're back. We're going one. That's the one I was going to pick anyway.
[2829.05s -> 2840.54s]  Another river. All right. You're now at green river crossing. Let's look around.
[2840.54s -> 2854.42s]  This looks like a big river. Okay. Check. How are we doing? Talk to people.
[2855.22s -> 2861.02s]  A Shoshone Indian tells you when wagons first started coming through here, we did not mind.
[2861.02s -> 2865.34s]  We even found it good to trade game and fish with the travelers and help them cross the
[2865.34s -> 2880.14s]  rivers. Now there are too many white men and too little land for grazing. I mean we did,
[2880.14s -> 2888.28s]  we did like, I mean, I mean the Native Americans, like we, like we fucking,
[2888.36s -> 2891.32s]  we fucked them. You know what I mean? Like that's like, it was bullshit.
[2891.88s -> 2924.42s]  They got a bad fucking deal. It's true. It's true. But let's cross. That's not political.
[2925.78s -> 2932.52s]  It's not. That's just, that's just, that's just the thing, right? I'm not going to afford
[2932.52s -> 2947.13s]  it. This is 20 fucking feet deep. You must cross the river in order to continue. The
[2947.13s -> 2952.89s]  river at this point is 400 feet across and 20 feet deep. Take my money. You know what I
[2952.89s -> 2962.82s]  mean? Take my money and get across safely. Take a ferry across. Use my money. I live on in my
[2962.82s -> 2973.70s]  money. I live on through my capital. Take the ferry. It's only five bucks. Why could I not
[2973.70s -> 2991.32s]  take it before? It's only five dollars. Yeah. Take my money. Get over safely. Start a family
[2991.32s -> 3011.58s]  with Jex. Kevin Jex. Virgin Jerma. Chad Jex. Oh, fuck. From Green River Crossing,
[3011.58s -> 3024.97s]  it is 143 miles to Soda Spring. People are good. Health is good. I think we can turn it
[3024.97s -> 3032.28s]  to grueling. No, I'm not going to go hunting. I don't need it. I've got my money. Very little
[3032.28s -> 3044.70s]  water. What do you mean very little water? Yeah, drink from the spring. Oh, Otto sure got
[3044.70s -> 3049.21s]  big. I know who's been eating all the food. Now I know who's been stress eating.
[3057.72s -> 3069.62s]  This is Inspector Gadget. No, it's not. Gadget.
[3073.83s -> 3083.80s]  Everything is Inspector Gadget, apparently. Okay, we need to see if we can trade with somebody.
[3083.80s -> 3093.32s]  I got plenty of autos. Plenty of clothes. I might want to get some more food. Who wants
[3093.56s -> 3096.84s]  Okay, look, look, look, look. We don't need bullets. 418 bullets.
[3098.42s -> 3101.22s]  He will trade you one ox. Do we need any more oxes?
[3104.90s -> 3110.26s]  Five community subs just came in from Cole. Thank you, Cole RG for the five community subs.
[3115.37s -> 3120.65s]  What? Why? Hold on. Somebody just wrote, why do you have so much of everything? You casual
[3120.65s -> 3143.05s]  bank of fuck. What? Jesus. Because it said from Boston. I had to click it. If it said
[3143.93s -> 3148.73s]  that you're penniless from Boston, I would have clicked that one. All right. Are you
[3148.73s -> 3160.84s]  willing to trade? No, it's my money. All right, let's go. Let's go fast. Really fast. Go. 57
[3160.84s -> 3180.58s]  miles. Inadequate grass. Inadequate grass. Yes, I'd like to look around. Big boy. Ego. Thanks
[3180.58s -> 3189.40s]  for the five community subs. Five subs. Thanks for dropping in with five. Thank you.
[3190.33s -> 3195.78s]  Thank you, big boy. I think it's time to buy some I want to buy some more food.
[3195.78s -> 3198.74s]  No, I don't. Well, holy shit. This is a nice thing. No, look at that.
[3202.04s -> 3209.16s]  That's pretty cheap. Is it? All right. No more. I've got to save my money.
[3210.04s -> 3216.70s]  Because now I need to take ferries every time. Talk to people.
[3217.80s -> 3225.96s]  Fellow traveler tells you four voices. This one. No, this one. No, two.
[3227.08s -> 3239.21s]  This one. Three. I think four. Oh, which one? Hey. Fort. Fort Hall is a busy fort.
[3239.21s -> 3243.21s]  The wide stretches of meadow grass here are just what our tired animals need.
[3243.21s -> 3247.85s]  As for me, I'll fix up the wagon leaks. Amanda's real anxious to wash all the clothes
[3247.85s -> 3255.10s]  and linens in one of those clay streets. Five. I got five now. I got five voices now.
[3257.43s -> 3272.49s]  Uh, rest for two days. Go. Inadequate grass. Bad water. What does that mean?
[3274.49s -> 3282.63s]  Find wild fruit. Cool. There was just you just ate it. There was this grass right there.
[3282.63s -> 3290.14s]  Bad water. Bad water. Health poor. Impassable trail. Oh, what do you mean? Bad water.
[3290.14s -> 3301.82s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm stopping here to rest. No one wants to trade with you today.
[3302.46s -> 3308.82s]  Okay, fine. Jeez. All right, we're gonna slow it down. Change pace.
[3309.62s -> 3319.90s]  We're gonna do steady. I'm also going to rest here for like three days. Three days. Health. Fair.
[3320.78s -> 3332.82s]  Okay. Continue. One of the oxen is injured. Okay, that's why I bought 15 of them. Bad water.
[3332.82s -> 3337.93s]  Bad water. Very little water. We're almost there. Just get there. Very little water.
[3337.93s -> 3344.22s]  We're at water now. Find wild fruit. Why did that just pop up? You are now at the
[3344.30s -> 3357.61s]  Snake River Crossing. Would you like to look around? Yep. June 20th, 1848. Okay. How are
[3357.61s -> 3367.78s]  we doing? Talk to people. A frantic wife tells you. Every, every time I do a, okay, every time
[3367.78s -> 3377.91s]  I do a female voice, they're always British. Why? It says right here. Then it says, I don't
[3377.91s -> 3386.84s]  know how to do a female voice. The only, Paula Dane is the only female I can do. That's
[3386.84s -> 3398.46s]  not it. No, female voice. That's not Paula Dane or like Keira Knightley. There's Elmo. Paula
[3398.46s -> 3423.62s]  Dane is Elmo. It says right here in the Shiver, Shively guidebook, you must hire an Indian to
[3423.62s -> 3428.42s]  pilot you at the crossing of the Snake River, it being dangerous if not perfectly understood.
[3428.42s -> 3438.62s]  But my husband insists on crossing without a guide. That's pretty good. Well, your husband's,
[3438.62s -> 3453.56s]  your husband's dumb. See you, see you when we get to cross, when we go across. I will take
[3453.56s -> 3456.52s]  a, you must cross the river in order to continue. The river is at this point is
[3456.52s -> 3463.85s]  currently a thousand feet across and six feet deep in the middle. Okay. Attempt to
[3463.85s -> 3469.29s]  forward the river, cock the wagon and floated across higher. We're going to hire somebody.
[3469.85s -> 3476.84s]  A guide says that he will take your wagon across the river for exchange for two sets
[3476.84s -> 3496.04s]  of clothing. Yes. Can I give you like five? Thank you. Let's go. Made it. You had no trouble
[3496.04s -> 3508.60s]  floating across the river. No, we didn't. Pogchamp. Pogchamp. Venuschamp. Jerma Venus
[3508.60s -> 3523.94s]  Pogchamp. Jerma Venus Pogchamp. Fogchamp. Let's go. We're almost there. I'm going to
[3523.94s -> 3550.09s]  get there. Otto has exhaustion. Go to sleep immediately. Five days. Metallix has a broken
[3550.09s -> 3561.98s]  leg from sleeping. Did you break your leg in bed? Ah, shit. I really twisted my ankle
[3561.98s -> 3573.94s]  to a point where I shattered my bones. And one of the oxygen has died. Inadequate
[3573.94s -> 3585.50s]  grass. It's okay. Metallix has got like gay for death. Yeah, you got to get up,
[3585.50s -> 3599.69s]  man and stretch. Be careful. A thief comes during the night and steals 36 pounds of food.
[3599.77s -> 3612.66s]  How? Broke a bone playing Fortnite. A thief comes. All right. Well, you got,
[3612.66s -> 3618.33s]  whatever. I got plenty of fucking food and money. I don't even know what happened.
[3620.50s -> 3626.02s]  I've got so many pounds of food. I just, I can't even count it. How do you count 900 pounds
[3626.02s -> 3631.37s]  of food? It's just huge in there and it's just whatever. What am I gonna have today?
[3631.37s -> 3642.65s]  Broccoli? Cheese? Meat? I don't know. It's just there. Tons of it. Let's look around.
[3642.65s -> 3657.14s]  That's Kim. Otto. And there's a baby, Jax Jr. Already had a kid. It didn't take you very long.
[3657.14s -> 3673.11s]  Didn't take that long. I mean, I've been died for, I've been died for like
[3673.83s -> 3683.34s]  up to a month. Wait a minute. Wait, is that, hold on. I've been dead for a month or two,
[3683.34s -> 3701.16s]  right? But the baby, that's a newborn. Takes nine months for, that's my, that's my son.
[3701.72s -> 3719.78s]  I didn't, I can't even see my own son. I'm gonna beat this even as a banker casual.
[3721.30s -> 3736.50s]  I've never seen the end of this game. No, that's Jax's kid. No. Buy supplies. How much money do I
[3736.50s -> 3743.43s]  have? I need food. I'm gonna buy whatever I can for food. How many pounds? 100 pounds of
[3743.43s -> 3760.95s]  food. Shit. 50 pounds of food. How much, wait, how much money do I have? Wait. No, I got 15
[3760.95s -> 3770.87s]  bucks. That's, that's three more ferries. Okay, we're good. Leave the store. Talk to people.
[3771.83s -> 3779.93s]  Aunt Rebecca tells you, at every fort along the trail, prices have been higher than at the
[3779.93s -> 3787.13s]  previous fort. This is outrageous, y'all. They're taking advantage of us. If I had the
[3787.13s -> 3793.29s]  chance to do it again, I'd buy more supplies and independence. And I'd put a little more
[3793.29s -> 3800.84s]  butter. I can only do, I can only do a fucking Paula Deen. That's it. I can't do anything else.
[3804.41s -> 3810.89s]  Do you need Paula Deen for your next project? I'm your guy. You need anything else? Just don't,
[3810.89s -> 3824.04s]  don't call me. Cowboy Elmo.
[3831.98s -> 3841.10s]  I thought this was a fucking bug. Reasons for camera to be on one, two, or three.
[3841.10s -> 3851.06s]  Hold on. Let me show you this. Okay, this is fine. Just look. I thought, I don't know why. I don't
[3851.06s -> 3862.15s]  know what the fuck is wrong with me. This is how you know that I'm fucking crazy. The shirt is
[3862.15s -> 3872.30s]  ripped, but it's okay. So I have one earphone in, right? I don't know how I moved. I don't
[3872.30s -> 3878.86s]  know how I moved a certain way, but this like came down and hit me in the chest. I don't,
[3878.86s -> 3882.94s]  I don't know how it happened. All I saw was this. I saw this like fall in front of my
[3882.94s -> 3889.82s]  face and hit me in the chest and I screamed. What's with this shirt? Because I put my,
[3890.78s -> 3896.50s]  look, when I was putting the shirt on, this shirt's like turning into cheesecloth because
[3896.50s -> 3902.50s]  it's so old and my mother drew it. So I like put my head on and I ripped through right here,
[3902.50s -> 3906.58s]  but I don't, I'm not getting rid of it. I'm not getting, this is, I love this shirt.
[3906.58s -> 3918.74s]  I accidentally ripped my hulk to my head through it. Fix it. No, I don't need to.
[3920.33s -> 3929.66s]  Just be lucky that I didn't even wear clothes today. This just happened. This didn't happen
[3929.66s -> 3935.26s]  like three months ago. This happened like four or five days ago. I already have my sewing kit
[3935.26s -> 3941.83s]  available. I just said, yeah, let me like take this t-shirt that I got, this old t-shirt.
[3941.83s -> 3958.89s]  Let me sew it together. Huh? But that's, I thought that was a scorpion. We got reports
[3958.89s -> 3963.51s]  that there's like scorpions now and I'm like fucking freaking out about it. I'm like,
[3963.51s -> 3988.01s]  wait, where are they? I've seen one already. Here we go. Uh, weather. Cool. So we're good.
[3988.01s -> 3991.69s]  I can't, no more supplies. We're going to continue on the trail from Fort Boise.
[3991.69s -> 3996.89s]  It is 160 miles to the Blue Mountains. Go, go. Very little water. I can't buy water. Where
[3996.89s -> 4008.39s]  do I get water? Health, poor. Health, poor. Oh, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Stop.
[4009.27s -> 4023.35s]  Rest for like three days. Still poor. You can't, I can't buy water. Are we going to have to
[4023.35s -> 4029.48s]  vampire somebody on the cruise ship here? Whose blood are we going to drink? We have to
[4029.48s -> 4046.82s]  vampire somebody. Uh, look at that. We're almost there. Just go. Come on. Get there.
[4047.46s -> 4063.75s]  One of the ox has died. It's okay. Come on. Got wild fruit. There's water right there.
[4063.75s -> 4074.54s]  There's water and fruit. Nice. Thank God for those random babies. You're now at
[4074.54s -> 4079.51s]  Blue Mountains. Would you like to look around? Water up on that mountain.
[4086.70s -> 4094.52s]  Let's talk. No, talk. Uh, Marnie Stewart tells you,
[4098.23s -> 4103.51s]  We followed the edge of the desert from Fort Boise to the forbidding wall of the Blue
[4103.51s -> 4110.81s]  Mountains. The hills were dreadful steep, locking both wheels. And coming down slow,
[4111.37s -> 4118.17s]  we got down safe. Poor animals. No grass or water for days.
[4119.13s -> 4139.67s]  Six voices. Going right for Boise. Head for Fort Walla or Fort, or head for the Dallas. Hold on.
[4139.67s -> 4154.33s]  The Dallas. That Dallas. Straight on. Straight on. 125 miles. Go. Heavy fog.
[4155.13s -> 4162.07s]  Should I just, should I just start sprinting? Yeah, we have to start sprinting.
[4163.77s -> 4167.69s]  Just go get to the finish line. You find an abandoned wagon with the following three
[4167.69s -> 4174.58s]  sets of clothing and 21 bullets. Thank you. Broken wagon axle. Would you like to try
[4174.66s -> 4178.97s]  to repair it? Yeah. You were able to repair the wagon axle. Thank you.
[4178.97s -> 4187.58s]  You find an abandoned wagon, but it is empty. Was it mine? Water right here.
[4187.58s -> 4198.89s]  You are now at the Dallas. Would you like to look around? Yes. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[4198.89s -> 4203.14s]  Let's have the conversation. We're at the Dallas. We're almost there.
[4204.20s -> 4205.64s]  Amy Witherspoon tells you,
[4211.48s -> 4223.83s]  Cousin Lydia engaged. Passage down the Columbia with
[4224.39s -> 4230.95s]  Indians a canoe with 17 people in luggage. The wind blew so heavy they had to lay by.
[4231.99s -> 4237.93s]  New dark high waves came up over their heads. Finally they made it to shore safely.
[4243.42s -> 4249.42s]  Seven. Well, four. I'm Hugh Bliss. That's what I was just doing. That's what I heard it.
[4250.28s -> 4255.74s]  Yeah, that's, that's what I've been hearing. We've heard a lot of Hugh Bliss talking.
[4258.26s -> 4272.34s]  Interesting. I wish I was between Derma's vocal bands. What? Why? What does that mean?
[4274.06s -> 4279.69s]  Seven voices. All right. We're almost there. Look at this. Oregon city. I'm going to sprint
[4279.69s -> 4289.45s]  as fast as possible. Change pace, grueling, change food rations, eat as much food as possible.
[4290.09s -> 4297.02s]  Eat, just, just stuff your face forever. Go. The trail divides here. You may float
[4297.02s -> 4302.38s]  down the Columbia River or take the Barlow toll road. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4307.67s -> 4315.34s]  Float down the river. Can I pay for it? Is it my money? Can we take them down?
[4318.47s -> 4328.06s]  Toll road is money. Toll road. That's five bucks. You must pay $12 to travel on the
[4328.06s -> 4332.94s]  Barlow Road. Are you willing to do this? Oh, thank God. Thank God. I'm still living.
[4332.94s -> 4340.01s]  You thought I died in the first five minutes. No, I'm still alive. 12 bucks. Let's go. From
[4340.01s -> 4345.45s]  the Dallas. It is a hundred miles to the Willamette Valley. Go as fast as you can.
[4347.32s -> 4353.35s]  Sprint. Heavy fog. Lose a day. Who cares? Impassable trail. Lose four days. Go.
[4353.35s -> 4361.38s]  Just sprint. Just go as fast as you can. Just no clip. You find an abandoned wagon.
[4361.38s -> 4372.65s]  Three sets of clothes. Excellent. I made it. Is this Oregon? Congratulations. You've made it
[4372.65s -> 4378.78s]  to Oregon. Let's see how many points you have received. Four people in fair health.
[4378.78s -> 4385.66s]  1600 points. One wagon. 14 ox. Nine spare parts. 23 sets of clothes. 1500 volts. 342
[4385.66s -> 4406.18s]  pounds of food. Free cash. 1800. 13 points. Let's go. So this is just a fake leaderboard.
[4406.18s -> 4424.94s]  It doesn't mean anything. Banker doesn't count. All right. Type your name. I beat the Oregon
[4424.94s -> 4435.99s]  Trail. Banker doesn't count. Banker doesn't count. Banker doesn't count. Banker doesn't
[4435.99s -> 4445.59s]  count. Count. You guys are fucked. All right. Here we go. Let's check. That's it. That's
[4445.59s -> 4464.09s]  that. I beat it. I did it. I win. Let's pick another one. That was fun. I never even
[4464.09s -> 4468.01s]  like played that game all the way through. I always just died in the first like 15 minutes
[4468.01s -> 4482.38s]  every time. All right. Let's go back to the list of games. Like this. Here we are. Remember,
[4483.26s -> 4491.40s]  if you want me to scroll, you click on the German face. Popsicle face. Because we are,
[4491.40s -> 4498.04s]  I mean, we just, we just did the Oregon Trail. That's it. I might not ever even see
[4498.04s -> 4509.43s]  past this page. All right. Here you go. Click. Let's determine. We want me to scroll. We've
[4509.43s -> 4544.57s]  got to click the face. Go for it. Okay. I should have done deluxe first. I didn't pick.
[4549.77s -> 4566.17s]  Oh my God. Oh, this is all fucked up. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. There we go. Now go
[4566.17s -> 4592.23s]  for it. There was like 20,000 clicks. People could just spam. Fucking Oregon Trail deluxe.
[4602.39s -> 4617.16s]  Just, we just did this. All right. This is closing in 10 seconds. Five, six, seven,
[4617.80s -> 4625.67s]  eight, nine, ten. Oh, come on. Don't do this to me. Do I have to flip a coin?
[4631.75s -> 4640.58s]  It was, I guess we're going. We're scrolling. I have to flip. I have to
[4640.58s -> 4645.06s]  flip a coin. I have to. That's fair. That's the only fair way to do this.
[4645.06s -> 4650.09s]  I stopped it and it was tied. Let's flip a coin. I don't have any coins up here.
[4650.09s -> 4658.86s]  All right. We're going to flip the wine cork. Okay. If it lands on wine stain side, then
[4658.86s -> 4665.94s]  we're doing Oregon Trail deluxe. If it lands on clean cork side, we're doing a scroll.
[4665.94s -> 4672.54s]  Here we go. Ready? Wait, what am I? What is that going to do? No. Okay. Yeah. If this,
[4672.54s -> 4682.89s]  if it's pointing up, whatever one's pointing up. Okay. So ready? If, uh, what was it?
[4682.89s -> 4688.17s]  If the clean's pointing up, it's, we scroll. And if, okay, clean pointing up scroll.
[4688.73s -> 4735.90s]  I didn't want to play this. Another, I'm going to, okay. I didn't, I never said I had to play
[4735.90s -> 4743.99s]  it well. I'm going to try to die as fast as possible. I actually have a mouse this time.
[4743.99s -> 4749.46s]  Hey, you're about to, you're about to begin great adventure. Traveling the Oregon Trail
[4749.46s -> 4753.30s]  across the rugged landscape of North America. Your covered wagon pulled by a team of oxen
[4753.30s -> 4772.18s]  will travel from, why didn't we just do this one first? Uh, why didn't you? I don't know
[4772.18s -> 4778.57s]  because this is what you guys voted for. Uh, I'm going to be a doctor. No, a teacher.
[4786.50s -> 4801.75s]  We didn't though. What? This is what you guys clicked on. They clicked scroll. Well,
[4801.75s -> 4808.57s]  I closed the poll and like 15 seconds later it came through. I got to close it at some
[4808.57s -> 4856.06s]  point. Can't sit there forever. And I flipped the cork. No, not Junior. There you go. What?
[4856.06s -> 4897.43s]  Oh, there he is again. All right. Let's, uh, uh, do you have 400 bucks? That's it. 10, 6, um,
[4897.43s -> 4906.71s]  who cares about bullets? I'm not going to use them. And, uh, 800 pounds of food,
[4906.71s -> 4914.26s]  500 pounds of food. Let's go. Let's go. When do you set off? Uh, what's the worst month
[4914.26s -> 4924.28s]  to do it? August. This one looks so much better. I, oh, a song. Oh, a song. I don't care. Uh,
[4924.28s -> 4935.18s]  what was I doing? This is cool. Uh, okay. Status. Money. I'm a teacher. Map. Continue.
[4935.74s -> 4952.28s]  Talk. Trade. Pace. Ruling. Pace. Continue. You've reached the Kansas River Cross. We just
[4952.28s -> 4959.14s]  did. This is just a better graphical version. Talk. With crowds of people waiting to get on
[4959.14s -> 4962.18s]  the ferry, we should be, could be stranded here for days. Hope there's enough grace for
[4962.18s -> 4966.74s]  all those animals. Not many people carry feed at other weight though than cross a rickety.
[4966.74s -> 4981.10s]  Okay. We're going to afford it. We're good. We made it. You made it across,
[4981.10s -> 4983.58s]  but got stuck in the muddy river banks. That doesn't matter.
[4987.45s -> 4999.05s]  Kim was bitten by a snake in the water. It's been two more days. Kim is turning purple.
[5001.03s -> 5013.11s]  Yes. Oh, we got to go. I can't rest for like, I can't rest for like a hundred days.
[5013.75s -> 5023.16s]  Time out. What do you mean time out? You must cross the river.
[5023.16s -> 5027.74s]  Didn't I just cross the river? It's only one feet deep. I just did this.
[5028.30s -> 5043.21s]  Wait, somebody stole 15 bucks from the wagon? Who? You made it safely across. We're fine.
[5043.21s -> 5052.14s]  It's a different river. Oh, rest for a day. Here we go. We're going to get to,
[5053.62s -> 5056.52s]  have I beat both? Kim's died of...
[5070.54s -> 5073.50s]  Yeah, number 700 has dysentery. Of course they do.
[5080.73s -> 5083.05s]  All right. Time out. Time out. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5087.50s -> 5093.18s]  Turn down the rations. Rest for a minute here. We can't have everybody just die. Three.
[5093.18s -> 5097.69s]  This is how I used to play it back when I was in middle school. I didn't understand.
[5098.25s -> 5112.60s]  Are they still eating food when I'm sitting here? Hey, what are you doing? What? What's
[5112.60s -> 5119.58s]  going on? Why isn't playing itself? You had a wagon wheel break. You're able to fix it.
[5119.58s -> 5127.96s]  You've reached the... I didn't do anything. That's not how living works. Health is poor.
[5127.96s -> 5137.85s]  Hold on. Rest. How many? Let me check my my shit here. Hold on. Rest for two days. Time out.
[5137.85s -> 5146.04s]  Don't just go. Status. Everyone's in poor health here. I only have 200 pounds of food?
[5146.04s -> 5153.83s]  I need to change this. That's okay. I need to trade. What do you want to get by trading?
[5153.83s -> 5160.28s]  I want pounds of food. Like a hundred pounds of food. Sorry, but nobody here's got a hundred
[5160.28s -> 5175.56s]  pounds of food to spare. Talk. Jimmy Rock by Moonlight is awfully sublime. Many Indians
[5175.56s -> 5179.88s]  came to our wagon with fish to exchange for clothing. We bought a number. They'd understand.
[5179.88s -> 5186.62s]  Okay. Okay, let's go. Hunt. I can hunt for food. You can't go hunting because
[5186.62s -> 5192.15s]  you don't have any bullets. Oh, I didn't buy any bullets because I didn't use them last time.
[5197.26s -> 5213.27s]  Oops. Dermot Jr. is suffering from exhaustion. The baby? No. Let's rest for like four days.
[5217.14s -> 5230.81s]  Rest. Rest. Rest. I still don't... I need food. Okay. Rest. How many days have gone by?
[5231.05s -> 5239.70s]  There we go. Timeout. That's what's the status now. Exhaustion. Poor. Poor. No bullets.
[5240.58s -> 5250.46s]  I only... Okay. I'm doing all right. He's 20 years old. He's 20 months old. Do hunting,
[5250.46s -> 5262.07s]  please. Otto has cholera. Okay. I need bullets. Buy. How much money do I have?
[5262.87s -> 5270.52s]  I have five dollars. Bullets. Okay. I can get a box. I can get one box of bullets,
[5270.52s -> 5278.90s]  which is 20 bullets. 20 bullets at the store. Hunt. Hunting is not allowed near the fort
[5278.90s -> 5291.35s]  because there are too many people around. Okay. What was that? I keep thinking that
[5291.35s -> 5296.65s]  somebody's breaking their legs. There's no grass for the oxen. Dermot Jr. got sick and died.
[5298.17s -> 5330.89s]  All right. Well, okay. Well, hunt. Who's still alive? Otto and who? There's no bullet?
[5330.89s -> 5344.57s]  There's no travel time? Pretty sick Sega Genesis sounds. How much meat? You shot
[5344.89s -> 5348.97s]  2800 pounds of food and used 20 bullets. You can only carry 200 food back. Well,
[5348.97s -> 5353.96s]  what's the point of shooting that many? All right. Everybody rest. We're going to rest for
[5353.96s -> 5387.86s]  a long time. Nine days. Didn't Otto die? No. No. All right. Everyone. People are recovering.
[5393.53s -> 5405.03s]  Okay. Let's do a strenuous pace. Rations. Let's go up to stay meager. Let's talk.
[5405.67s -> 5410.49s]  Goodbye. Flat river. Goodbye. Sand hills and white buffaloes. We already read this.
[5412.07s -> 5424.47s]  Well, we already saw that. We're almost halfway there. You found some wild fruit and
[5424.47s -> 5429.35s]  BIA 700 broke their arm pulling it out. Otto was bitten by a snake. He's dead. That's a
[5429.35s -> 5442.54s]  death sentence. How do you, how do I cure his snake bite? Can I get poison cure? He's just
[5442.54s -> 5452.30s]  dead. Otto died of a snake bite. BIA number 700 is the only one left. He broke his arm
[5453.26s -> 5472.95s]  picking berries. What? That was so fast. Oh, Otto died of a snake. Otto got bit by a snake.
[5472.95s -> 5479.83s]  Oh no. A few days later, Otto died of a snake bite. BIA 700 just got sick and died immediately.
[5480.39s -> 5488.66s]  We got to Independence Rock. Who's alive? Is it just the oxen? There's nobody alive.
[5489.75s -> 5497.64s]  There's nobody on the way. It's me. I'm still alive. I made it this whole time. All right.
[5497.64s -> 5509.30s]  Rest. Rest. All the food is mine. Nine days of rest. I'm taking this dead seriously now.
[5509.30s -> 5526.31s]  I only need to, I have 300 pounds of food. I can eat as much as I want too. This is great.
[5526.31s -> 5540.87s]  I'm going to make it. Yeah, I'm going to make it. All right. I'm, everything's fair.
[5541.96s -> 5551.85s]  I'm eating my fill. I'm just steak and mashed potatoes and green beans. It's perfect.
[5551.85s -> 5561.72s]  Got to South Pass. Can we hunt? No, I don't have any bullets. I need to try to buy.
[5562.68s -> 5572.63s]  You can only buy supplies at forts. What about trade? Bullets. I need like five. Nobody's got
[5572.63s -> 5578.14s]  five bullets to spare. I find that really hard to believe. Head to fort to buy supplies. Take
[5578.14s -> 5589.10s]  the shortcut to Green River. How much money do I have? I have two bucks. I can't buy anything.
[5589.10s -> 5599.10s]  All right. We're going to take the shortcut. The water. I'll get the water soon.
[5603.34s -> 5620.10s]  Come on. Go. The water is right here. Almost there. Yes. All right. Now I'm going to sit
[5620.10s -> 5632.36s]  down. I'm going to rest for a couple days. Resting. We're now at fair. 219 pounds of
[5632.36s -> 5653.10s]  food. River is 400 feet wide and 20 feet deep. I don't have enough money to get the ferry. I need
[5653.10s -> 5675.85s]  the ferry. Cock the wagon and float it. Yes. I did it. You thought I was going to crash.
[5678.46s -> 5686.84s]  No, I wasn't making a YouTube video this time. I'm getting all the way there.
[5686.84s -> 5701.70s]  No, wait. Stop, stop. No, no, no, no. Rest, rest, rest. Four days. Come on,
[5701.70s -> 5717.70s]  get over the cholera. Just eat more food. Have more chicken soup. No grass. What's this?
[5717.70s -> 5726.62s]  Soda springs. Okay. Let me trade. I need bullets. I just want, I only need five bullets.
[5726.62s -> 5733.59s]  Nobody's got five bullets spare. Okay. Anybody have one bullet to spare? I just need one. I
[5733.59s -> 5738.31s]  didn't need to shoot one thing. Sure. I'll trade you one bullet for one set of clothing.
[5738.31s -> 5756.63s]  Is that a deal? Oh, you fucking asshole. I was going to say, I can't like bum a cigarette
[5756.63s -> 5768.31s]  off somebody. One bullet if you didn't have it. Here we go. Hunt. Shot has to count.
[5768.31s -> 5777.06s]  No, it's going to be a buffalo. Don't shoot the rabbit. You're going to miss. No, don't shoot the
[5777.06s -> 5783.43s]  squirrel. I need a big animal like an, like a buffalo or an oxen. This will do. This will do.
[5788.18s -> 5799.69s]  What? Wait, hold on. That didn't connect? How did that miss? There's no way. That's unbelievable.
[5799.69s -> 5823.00s]  I'll trade you one bullet for one pound of food. Is it a deal? Yeah. Let's go. Fair. There
[5823.00s -> 5830.41s]  it is. Done. That's going to be like 200. 100 pounds of food. Thank you very much. Let's go.
[5830.97s -> 5846.41s]  Derm is well again. I'm doing just fine. Okay. Trade. Five bullets. No one has five in the
[5846.41s -> 5855.66s]  fort. No one has five. Everyone just has one. One bullet. Sorry. Nobody's got one bullet to
[5855.66s -> 5871.86s]  spare. It's a blizzard. Stop. All right. Just rest in the blizzard. Just wait it out. I'm
[5871.86s -> 5892.92s]  all right. I'm okay. I'm back to being poor. Fair. We're good. You lost the trail. That's okay.
[5892.92s -> 5897.35s]  I'm still doing fine. I'll pick it up again though. How many days is it going to take you
[5897.35s -> 5911.45s]  to do this? Three? Two days. Three days. Three days. Four days of losing the trail. Five. God.
[5911.45s -> 5934.98s]  Another fucking blizzard. Health is good. All right. Go. I'm almost there. I'm going
[5934.98s -> 5938.90s]  to do it. Oh, just you backer. You're so easy. What about on teacher? I only had like
[5938.90s -> 5953.80s]  $400. I'm going to make it. I will make it. I will persevere. I will get there. I have diarrhea.
[5953.80s -> 5969.50s]  Slow down. You can't die of diarrhea. I mean, you can actually, but it has to be a lot,
[5969.50s -> 5982.82s]  right? Okay. You've reached, you've reached the snake river crossing. That's such bullshit.
[5982.82s -> 5991.94s]  Where's the guy that bought 1500 bullets last game? He's not here. Okay. Uh, how
[5991.94s -> 5998.02s]  many, how much company? How many sets of clothing do I have? Yeah, I don't need all
[5998.02s -> 6023.58s]  these clothes. Let's go safely again. We make it safe again. I, I'm, I'm, I'm okay. Gruelling. Go.
[6024.14s -> 6034.78s]  Oh my God. He almost didn't make. I were, but you were able to replace it. Okay.
[6036.30s -> 6040.90s]  I keep thinking that's my neck. Derma is doing just fine. He's well again.
[6044.23s -> 6054.28s]  All right. Trade. One bullet. Can I just buy one bullet box of bullets? I can't just buy
[6054.36s -> 6066.14s]  one. Let's talk. Anybody. You'll not get your wagon over the blue mountains, Mr. Leave it. Cross
[6066.14s -> 6070.14s]  your goods over with a pack animals. Get yourself a couple of good mules, pieces of wagons,
[6070.14s -> 6075.18s]  litter the trail left by them. Folks who don't need good advice. Thank you. Appreciate it.
[6077.45s -> 6084.39s]  Trade for dollars. Um, 15 dollars. What do you want? What does anybody want?
[6085.61s -> 6110.90s]  15 bucks for one set of clothing. Absolutely. Let's go buy box of bullets and, um,
[6110.90s -> 6118.62s]  27 pounds of food. No, what am I doing? I don't need to do that. I can just shoot.
[6123.80s -> 6137.62s]  Why would I buy food? Whatever. I'm going to make it. I don't know why I did that.
[6141.19s -> 6149.06s]  Don't shoot the rabbits of both bullets. Waste of bullets. Move. Is it only rabbits?
[6149.06s -> 6158.78s]  I'm a bit panic shooting. All right. That's it. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[6162.33s -> 6181.06s]  Yeah, go type. No, I have typhoid fever. Just go sleep for nine days. You'll be fine.
[6194.55s -> 6209.75s]  That's how typhoid works. I'm fine. Just have to go to bed for a few days.
[6209.75s -> 6215.80s]  Everyone's Spider-Man goes to sleep for like five days and he thinks it's been like one
[6215.80s -> 6229.62s]  night and he gets his like powers. Remember that episode of the cartoon? All right.
[6229.62s -> 6252.52s]  All right. The home stretch. This lady's a white walker. Uh, okay. Let's, um,
[6253.24s -> 6271.94s]  I want to see the map. Here we are. That was like piercing blue eyes. I think I'm good. I
[6271.94s -> 6283.10s]  don't need to rest. I'm in good health. Let's go shortcut. I have a fever. Sleep for nine
[6283.10s -> 6312.04s]  days. Just go to bed for nine days. Works every time. Don't even do that. Are you telling
[6312.04s -> 6318.20s]  me that I can get typhoid fever and get better from typhoid in nine days, but I have
[6318.20s -> 6323.98s]  a fever and it won't. Okay. That was going to say. And only prescription is more cowbell.
[6326.04s -> 6332.92s]  Reference for those Saturday Night Live fans of you, of you out there. An ox wandered off.
[6334.07s -> 6342.57s]  It's all right. I have like 10 of them. Shut up. Broken neck. It's all right. I'm almost there.
[6342.57s -> 6359.14s]  An ox is sick. I made it. I did it. I just have to go through here. I got food. I, how
[6359.14s -> 6372.76s]  much money do I have? I have 35 cents. I don't have, it's $12. I can do it. I just have to
[6372.76s -> 6391.90s]  raft down the river. I don't have the money for the toll. Trade for cash for one ox. I have
[6391.90s -> 6418.60s]  six ox. Oh yeah. Toll road. $15. I'll see ya. I'm coming home. We're there. I did it. I made
[6418.60s -> 6437.24s]  it. I made it. I did the Oregon Trail. Did I die? I thought I died right here. I did it.
[6437.24s -> 6451.30s]  Germa lives. I just, yeah, I die in the next episode. Celebratory, celebratory dysentery.
[6451.30s -> 6465.62s]  Yeah. And I think that was a teacher. Less points than last time. Got the teacher bonus.
[6466.81s -> 6478.07s]  Pretty cool. All right. Let's, uh, thankfully that's, oh, there are no more Oregon Trails
[6478.07s -> 6496.71s]  on here. So I think we're fairly safe in getting out of this. Let me go here. All
[6496.71s -> 6505.27s]  right. So I don't know if we're ever going to get out of here. Click the Germa face
[6505.27s -> 6522.15s]  if you want to scroll. Remember. Remember. Let me get right, right here. Hold on. Let
[6522.15s -> 6546.94s]  me get this restarted. Okay. Oh, wow. A hundred percent. One hundred fucking percent. That's
[6546.94s -> 6558.82s]  a lot. Sorry, Wolfenstein. Doesn't look like it's going to be your day today.
[6558.82s -> 6575.80s]  A hundred percent is like basically everyone. Basically. Yeah. All right, guys. I think this
[6575.80s -> 6579.56s]  is just an absolute no contest. I'm going to scroll and scrolling means this whole page
[6579.56s -> 6608.71s]  goes down. So we are going to go all the way down here to here, as you see. Here we go again.
[6608.71s -> 6632.26s]  Ooh, we're indecisive this time. Leaning towards Batman returns. A lot of people want to
[6632.26s -> 6650.54s]  scroll too. I think it's going to be Batman. No, Doom the Roguelike. He's rigging it.
[6651.90s -> 6663.74s]  Doom the Roguelike. What is this even going to be? All right. That's it. We're going to play
[6663.82s -> 6673.21s]  Doom the Roguelike. Let's open it. I'm going to remove this now because it doesn't need to
[6673.21s -> 6686.97s]  be there anymore for the sake of right now. All right. Doom the Roguelike. All right. I guess
[6686.97s -> 6707.16s]  let's open it. Hold on. There we go. Major changes since Doom Roguelike. Let's see also.
[6707.16s -> 6721.30s]  Okay. Enter name. Choose a trait. Iron Man, finesse hell runner, tough as nails,
[6721.30s -> 6729.37s]  son of a bitch, son of a gun, reloader, eagle eye, cat eye, or brute. Pick banker. Hit points
[6729.37s -> 6736.90s]  by 10. Iron Man, finesse, hell runner, tough as nails, increases damage by, I like damage by
[6736.90s -> 6751.37s]  one. Firing time minus 20 percent, son of a gun. The trip was long. You thought it would
[6751.37s -> 6759.69s]  never end. Hell, a job as a Marine Reserve is so boring. You hate UAC. Nothing happens here.
[6759.69s -> 6766.81s]  Even now, you have to wait for your fellow Marines who are supposed to check what happened
[6766.81s -> 6775.69s]  on Phobos. Not knowing what to do with yourself, you just sit near the comm console and listen to
[6775.69s -> 6788.94s]  the news from your fellow Marines. Okay. Enter. Hell, what a bloodshed. You hear from the comm
[6789.58s -> 6799.32s]  everywhere. What happened here? Look, there's someone there. Oh no, God. Gunshot. This can't
[6799.32s -> 6813.91s]  be true. Help. I'm Jake. Is this how Doom starts? Is this the beginning of Doom? No.
[6817.75s -> 6850.54s]  Slurp. Well, alien. Welcome to the Doom Roguelike. Is that me? It's one of these.
[6851.10s -> 6860.12s]  It's actually like an old school text-based adventure. There's a small med pack lying here.
[6860.12s -> 6874.57s]  How do I pick it up? Unknown command. Oh shit. Getting stuck. Key bindings. Walk. Wait. Run.
[6874.57s -> 6879.69s]  Go downstairs. Pick up item from floor is G. Drop item. Open. Close door. Toggle. Look
[6879.69s -> 6886.78s]  boat. Fire equip weapon. Fire equip is F. You just tab to switch targets. So F and G
[6886.78s -> 6902.76s]  are what we need right now. F and G. No. What are we doing? Escape exits. Does it? I can't
[6902.76s -> 6930.60s]  get out. I can't get out of key bindings. I can't get out of here. Escape. No, it's not
[6930.60s -> 6942.78s]  backspace. It's escape. Well, hold on. Let me. What if I press escape again? There we go.
[6942.78s -> 6948.70s]  Okay. It can't be in full screen. All right. We're good. We're back. So it was F and G,
[6948.70s -> 6958.25s]  right? Picked up a small med pack. Small med pack. You see germa. Unhurt. You see floor.
[6959.91s -> 6968.47s]  Fire. Choose target. Fire a more constructive way to commit suicide. Wait, what? Oh, I tried
[6968.47s -> 6980.63s]  to shoot myself with a gun. Fire at the rock? Oh, fire. Okay, I see. Fire at the ground.
[6984.65s -> 6997.53s]  I only have five bullets. I'm just testing my gun. I think that's a door up there,
[6997.53s -> 7015.40s]  right? Okay, there's a door here. Press X to enable the music. There we go. Open the door. Boom.
[7016.52s -> 7025.02s]  Hey, whoa! The former human fires. You're hit. You're bleeding. What human? This H? Since when
[7025.02s -> 7028.94s]  did the Sesame Street letters stop fucking fighting each other? Okay, the former human.
[7028.94s -> 7033.88s]  Fire. The missile hits the former human. You lose blood. The former human misses you.

[7091.72s -> 7098.87s]  former. You miss the former human. The former human misses you. Your weapon is empty. How do
[7098.87s -> 7107.26s]  you reload? You reload the pistol. The former human misses you. Former human. The missile hits
[7107.26s -> 7115.35s]  the former human. The former human dies. Boom. A former human hits you. Choose target. A former
[7115.35s -> 7120.84s]  human. The missile hits the former human. The former human dies. Boom. The missile hits the
[7120.84s -> 7126.62s]  former human. The former human. You see a former human. Heavily wounded. The missile hits
[7126.62s -> 7135.13s]  the former human. The former human dies. All right, how do I use a med kit? There's a pistol.
[7136.84s -> 7150.70s]  Picked up the pistol. There's a pistol. Ammo. How do I use a med kit? You reload. The former
[7150.70s -> 7156.89s]  human sergeant. Sergeant misses you. The missile hits the former human sergeant. The
[7156.89s -> 7164.18s]  former human sergeant misses you. The former human fires. You are more. How do I keep going?

[7169.66s -> 7174.76s]  former human sergeant misses you. There's 10 millimeter ammo here. The former human sergeant.
[7174.76s -> 7177.16s]  The missile hits the former human sergeant. The former human sergeant dies. The former
[7177.16s -> 7183.70s]  human fires. Boom. The missile hits the former human. The former human uses a small med
[7183.70s -> 7189.19s]  pack. The former human looks healthier. The missile hits the former human. A former
[7189.19s -> 7192.15s]  human almost dead. The missile hits the floor. Human. The former human dies.
[7196.26s -> 7208.04s]  Reload. All right. Med kit. I need to use. How do I use a med pack? Health. There's a
[7208.04s -> 7219.90s]  shotgun. I'll take it. I want to equip the shotgun. Prepare the shotgun. Is it I? Small
[7219.90s -> 7244.50s]  med pack. E. Did not. Son of a gun. Wait. Back it up. No items. I. F. I don't know why
[7244.50s -> 7259.18s]  that's not working. I. U. For use? To where will press the desired item letter? The F.
[7259.90s -> 7270.82s]  That doesn't use it. How do I get out of here? I cleared this whole area. What is
[7271.06s -> 7281.40s]  going to go down? Is there a staircase or something? It's the down arrow.
[7288.87s -> 7300.84s]  It's the V. How do I go downstairs? I'm going to check the keybindings. C. Run on. Okay.
[7300.84s -> 7306.15s]  Go downstairs. So it's actually that. You won't be able to come back. Drop item. Show

[7311.51s -> 7328.01s]  inventory is U. U? But I can't. That's weird. So I have to do. Let me go U. Ah.
[7329.13s -> 7339.40s]  All right. Okay. Let's go. I did it. You shiver from cold. What is the I? The imp
[7339.40s -> 7347.29s]  fire is boom. The imp misses you. There's a shotgun lying here. Shotgun. F. You shot
[7347.29s -> 7356.54s]  the barrel. The imp dies. The imp dies. Nice. Okay. I did it. The form of human
[7356.54s -> 7368.95s]  fire as you were hit. I have. Hold on. I don't have any more shotgun ammo. You
[7368.95s -> 7375.02s]  prepare the pistol. The form of human fire as you're hit. Form of human. The
[7375.02s -> 7377.18s]  missile hits the form of human. The form of human fire as you're hit. You're
[7377.18s -> 7383.69s]  bleeding. The missile hits the form of human. You use blood. Choose target. The
[7383.69s -> 7385.61s]  missile hits the form of human. The form of human dies. You lose blood.
[7386.41s -> 7396.09s]  Weapon is empty. Reload. The pistol is already loaded. Am I still bleeding? The
[7396.09s -> 7401.32s]  form of human sergeant reloads his shotgun. Get me out. What did I just do? What just
[7401.32s -> 7410.23s]  exploded? The form of human sergeant fires as you die. He was reloading. I was trying
[7410.23s -> 7421.27s]  to get in the room. I didn't level up. Yes I did. Level two on the bottom right. I
[7421.27s -> 7438.04s]  leveled up. I leveled up. Map level two. I know it's the map. That was actually
[7438.04s -> 7446.62s]  pretty cool. I didn't hate that. That was fun and interesting. All right. You
[7446.62s -> 7451.35s]  know what time it is. Click the face if you want to scroll or click
[7451.35s -> 7467.22s]  something else. Go for it. There's a version with graphics and sounds. All
[7467.22s -> 7472.26s]  right. We got a little bit of a fight here between Batman Returns and
[7472.34s -> 7501.26s]  Scroll please. 31 31. Don't make me have to flip the cork again. Dwarf Fortress.
[7507.53s -> 7519.72s]  All right. Don't let the fucking scrollers win. Um anyone that's going to
[7519.72s -> 7527.38s]  click on the screen has already done it. I think that's it. Five four three
[7528.12s -> 7552.92s]  two one. That's it. Batman Returns. Thank you for voting. Batman Returns. Let's
[7552.92s -> 7584.71s]  open it. Bitcoin miner. I've played this game before. This game sucks.
[7584.71s -> 7597.62s]  I appreciate the fact that they made this in Mario Paint. All right. Anything
[7597.62s -> 7609.19s]  else? Did I beat the game? It's just the song. It's just the song. That's
[7609.19s -> 7619.74s]  it. All right. Next. That was fun. Game over. Guys enter doesn't do
[7619.74s -> 7622.78s]  anything. I beat the game. We just had to hear the Mario Paint soundtrack.
[7622.78s -> 7623.18s]  Game over.
[7663.37s -> 7672.55s]  There's no way it's the before credits. I'm pressing enter x w q
[7674.36s -> 7692.41s]  Chevrolet. Oh the after credit scene. Are you fucking kidding me? It's a
[7692.41s -> 7701.74s]  point and click adventure game. Main computer. Oh my god you are slow as
[7701.74s -> 7709.46s]  shit. Batman. Batman doing a great impression of I'm pretending to work
[7709.46s -> 7717.88s]  at the office. All right. What? News broadcast. Evidence. Why is he dressed
[7717.88s -> 7720.92s]  like Batman right now? You don't have to be dressed like Batman.
[7731.02s -> 7734.62s]  This just in from Gotham Plaza. A gang of hooligans dressed as circus
[7734.62s -> 7737.98s]  performers have attacked the crowd gathered to watch the annual tree
[7737.98s -> 7741.66s]  lighting. Our communication lines in the area have been disrupted but as
[7741.66s -> 7746.86s]  told the violence is is the city council released a report today
[7746.86s -> 7749.50s]  predicting that the Gotham City will suffer a record deficit in this
[7749.50s -> 7755.26s]  year's budget. Revenues are far below projections and high expenses are
[7755.26s -> 7759.64s]  higher than expected. The slumping economy bears most of the blame
[7759.64s -> 7765.24s]  according to the computer guy. What the control the crime is up. The
[7765.24s -> 7770.68s]  temperatures are down and so are Gotham City's SAT scores according to the
[7770.68s -> 7777.24s]  board of education. The average Gotham student score dropped by 25 points.
[7778.04s -> 7781.80s]  No explanation was given for the sharp decline in scores. The arctic
[7781.80s -> 7785.56s]  weather which has left Gotham City numb depressed and weary. A bunch of
[7785.56s -> 7787.88s]  shows no signs of letting up according to the US weather bureau
[7787.88s -> 7792.92s]  forecast. Life sucks right now. Temperatures will remain below freezing
[7792.92s -> 7796.92s]  for at least a week with more snow a possibility. The long range forecast
[7796.92s -> 7799.80s]  calls for below normal temperatures for the rest of the winter.
[7799.80s -> 7803.32s]  Why is this the music we're playing on this broadcast? I have no idea. It's
[7803.32s -> 7807.32s]  scary horror music. Unemployment continues to climb in Gotham City
[7807.32s -> 7811.00s]  reaching a record high last month. Everything in the world sucks
[7811.00s -> 7813.80s]  according to a report from the human resource commission. The trend
[7813.80s -> 7818.10s]  shows no sign of reversing. By the way a computerized forecast
[7818.10s -> 7821.14s]  predict a controlled climb as the city loses an estimated
[7821.14s -> 7824.81s]  thousand jobs each month. This just in from Gotham Plaza.
[7824.81s -> 7828.09s]  In breaking news a gang of hooligans dressed as circus performers have attacked
[7828.09s -> 7844.46s]  more people. Oh my god that was a lot. Evidence.
[7844.46s -> 7852.47s]  What's in the evidence folder? Uh enter. No evidence to enter. How do
[7852.47s -> 7865.51s]  you get evidence? Extrapolate. No evidence. Uh video.
[7865.51s -> 7870.15s]  Select video. There are no videos. All right let's get out of here.
[7870.15s -> 7882.97s]  Get up from your fucking gamer chair Batman. Let's go.
[7883.05s -> 7887.05s]  Now where? Uh I can go this way. Wayne Manor.
[7887.05s -> 7901.02s]  The vault of the garage. Garage. Now he runs. All right jump.
[7904.22s -> 7909.74s]  What? But you watch TV. You're going to watch TV while you're driving.
[7909.74s -> 7912.94s]  The city council released a report today predicting that Gotham City will
[7912.94s -> 7915.34s]  suffer a record deficit in this year's budget.
[7915.34s -> 7922.44s]  Revenues are far below projections. You don't.
[7922.44s -> 7926.52s]  Why would you watch TV while you're driving?
[7926.52s -> 7938.50s]  Two TVs. He's playing like Clash of Clans over here with his iPad.
[7938.50s -> 7954.04s]  Batman injects from the Batmobile and he soars through the air.
[7954.28s -> 7963.94s]  Oh the driverless Batmobile carries through the streets.
[7963.94s -> 7982.12s]  Hitting people and...
[7997.77s -> 8001.53s]  Why? Why can you ghost ride the Batmobile
[8001.53s -> 8004.98s]  into people and into and explode it and shit?
[8004.98s -> 8009.94s]  Oh they just didn't give a fuck.
[8010.66s -> 8015.46s]  Oh that's the best game I've like ever played.
[8015.46s -> 8020.28s]  I gotta see. We can't just leave right now.
[8020.28s -> 8031.75s]  No. New game. I'm sorry that can't be how it ends.
[8031.75s -> 8039.34s]  Let's check the vault. I want to see what's in here. How many batsuits does
[8039.34s -> 8046.55s]  he have? Suit two defensive capability.
[8046.55s -> 8052.60s]  Put on suit three? They're all the same thing.
[8052.60s -> 8059.48s]  Why does he have a Peter Griffin closet of the same outfit?
[8059.48s -> 8070.01s]  Utility belt computer. Grapple. Gauntlet. Rope. Knockout gas.
[8070.01s -> 8081.94s]  Knockout gas. Rope. Smoke bomb.
[8081.94s -> 8089.53s]  And a bolo batarang? How many can I take?
[8089.53s -> 8098.98s]  Oh I can take like everything. All right.
[8098.98s -> 8110.74s]  I'm decked out. So now let me just... Let's go to Wayne
[8110.74s -> 8113.70s]  Manor. Have you completed everything you want
[8113.70s -> 8119.35s]  to do on this day? No. Why is this like...
[8119.35s -> 8122.97s]  We're gonna... Okay go back into the Batmobile.
[8122.97s -> 8132.55s]  Two scanners. One for each hand. Yeah. What is this thing?
[8132.55s -> 8136.23s]  Gotham Plaza mayor's office. Let's go downtown.
[8136.23s -> 8148.02s]  What's going on downtown? Street. Time. It's 6 47 pm. Street.
[8148.02s -> 8163.43s]  What is that? Is it a bird? Jewelry. Is it a robbery? What am I doing?
[8163.43s -> 8170.28s]  Roof? Am I gonna steal from the jewelry store?
[8170.28s -> 8179.06s]  He's looking through. I'm walking a tightrope. Doesn't Batman have
[8179.06s -> 8202.15s]  gadgets? What's the point of doing this?
[8202.15s -> 8206.95s]  He's just a cosplayer. This is not even real Batman.
[8206.95s -> 8219.45s]  All right. I don't think I can do anything here. What?
[8219.45s -> 8234.62s]  Why didn't you just do that over here? I don't even know where I am.
[8234.62s -> 8248.47s]  I can't go this way. The only thing I can do is go back. I guess I could go
[8248.47s -> 8262.97s]  to the street level from over here. Okay down to the street. Okay.
[8262.97s -> 8273.06s]  Liquor sale. 50% off. Nobody here. All right. Back to the
[8273.14s -> 8286.17s]  Batmobile. There's nobody here. Gotham Plaza. Oh my god. There's a bunch
[8286.17s -> 8299.40s]  of people here. Shrek's. All right. Let's go around.
[8299.40s -> 8318.49s]  It's not a yo-yo Batman. All right. Down to the street. What's going on?
[8318.49s -> 8322.62s]  What the fuck is going on? How do I fight?
[8322.62s -> 8327.10s]  I can't move the mouse up here. I can't fight this guy.
[8327.10s -> 8345.54s]  It's just easy. Normal. Fierce. Fierce. Yes, I want to interrogate.
[8345.54s -> 8353.70s]  Category of the question. Batman is high as fuck right now. Now I get it.
[8353.70s -> 8359.85s]  A leader. Tell me who you're working for.
[8359.85s -> 8363.99s]  A real fish lover, that's for sure. Try one.
[8363.99s -> 8370.30s]  What? Another fight.
[8370.30s -> 8378.62s]  I don't know what any of these do. Smoke bomb.
[8378.62s -> 8395.13s]  I'd stomp. Is there any more?
[8395.13s -> 8404.63s]  This music's gonna kill me. What time is it? It's 7 50 p.m.
[8404.63s -> 8419.13s]  Did I kill these people? Go up. Wrap back around.
[8419.21s -> 8430.30s]  Oh my god. No one's here. It's a fish for sure, right? What is it?
[8430.30s -> 8440.12s]  Clue? Oh, here we go. Satan? He's dead. I
[8440.12s -> 8456.42s]  killed him. These are all lethal somehow. I think
[8456.42s -> 8471.85s]  I cleared them. Back to the Bat
[8471.85s -> 8480.58s]  mobile. I got some intel. What about the news?
[8480.58s -> 8483.78s]  Hey, let me take my eyes off the road. The riot which broke out in the
[8483.78s -> 8488.01s]  plaza several hours ago has now spread to the downtown area.
[8488.01s -> 8491.77s]  Costumed monitors are terrorizing citizens and wrecking property throughout
[8491.77s -> 8495.86s]  downtown. Police seem unable to quell disturbances.
[8495.86s -> 8498.34s]  The city council released a report today predicting that Gotham City will
[8498.34s -> 8500.66s]  suffer a record deficit in this year's budget.
[8500.66s -> 8503.94s]  In case you forgot, revenues are fucked.
[8503.94s -> 8516.94s]  No one's making any money. Jobs are gone. Okay, downtown.
[8516.94s -> 8535.56s]  I don't have any more equipment left. Yeah, I do.
[8535.64s -> 8541.77s]  Just, just punch him. Punch him in the face. Fierce.
[8541.77s -> 8550.26s]  I keep killing them. I need to interrogate them, so just knock them out.
[8550.26s -> 8554.54s]  Come on, Batman. This person's not even attacking. Just punch them.
[8554.54s -> 8562.20s]  Just punch, just punch her in the face. Just punch them in the face.
[8562.20s -> 8581.40s]  Oh, I guess so. Oops. Use the bat gun. No, I don't want to hurt. I want to
[8581.40s -> 8593.67s]  interrogate somebody. No, they're gone. There's nobody here.
[8593.67s -> 8601.10s]  All right, get me out of here. I need more news.
[8601.10s -> 8604.78s]  Crime is up, the temperatures are down, and so Gotham City's SAT scores. This
[8604.78s -> 8608.62s]  guy just can't get over that. I'm not going to eject. All right, how
[8608.62s -> 8613.05s]  do I get back to, like, I gotta go back to Wayne Manor.
[8613.05s -> 8629.80s]  Bat cave. Mayor's office? What's on here?
[8629.80s -> 8639.10s]  Evidence? Nothing. Oh, there ain't nothing here.
[8639.10s -> 8643.90s]  Go back to, just go back to Wayne Manor and end the day. Get back in
[8643.90s -> 8648.31s]  your car. Yeah, just broke into the Mayor's
[8648.31s -> 8657.40s]  house. All right, back to Wayne Manor. Let's end the day.
[8657.40s -> 8667.03s]  Does he ever take off the suit? Wait, evidence, right?
[8667.03s -> 8678.14s]  I learned about the fish. Okay, evidence.
[8678.14s -> 8681.98s]  Evidence. Enter evidence. Frozen fish. Collected evidence. Entered.
[8681.98s -> 8687.66s]  Okay, a few frozen fish. Species Simonus frigidus,
[8687.66s -> 8691.40s]  native to the icy waters off the coast of Antarctica.
[8691.40s -> 8698.71s]  Okay, extrapolate. Not eaten by people used primarily as food for arctic avian
[8698.71s -> 8701.75s]  species such as penguins. Only known for
[8701.83s -> 8706.84s]  very obvious fish in Gotham City is Tony's fish market. Evidence.
[8706.84s -> 8721.91s]  All right, go to bed. All right, Wayne Manor, end the day.
[8721.91s -> 8733.50s]  A new day begins day two. Let's go. We've got the evidence we need.
[8733.50s -> 8745.16s]  I'm gonna go to the fish market. Fish market.
[8745.16s -> 8756.18s]  Interrogate. There he is. Batman, what can I do for you?
[8756.18s -> 8762.17s]  I understand that you sell fish called Simonus frigidus.
[8762.17s -> 8769.43s]  Yeah, what about him? Sold any recently?
[8769.43s -> 8778.47s]  A couple of days ago. I sent a crate load over in the old zoo about once a week.
[8778.47s -> 8784.20s]  Zoo. Thanks for your help. Zoo sounds...
[8784.20s -> 8806.49s]  Sorry, I'm so fucking high right now. Zoo? Did you say zoo? Old Gotham Zoo.
[8806.49s -> 8810.07s]  Arctic world. Well, what else is over here?
[8810.07s -> 8814.90s]  Oh, a videotape. Take it. Take the tape.
[8823.16s -> 8836.42s]  We have some evidence now. Oh, what's this? Circus poster. Take it.
[8836.42s -> 8842.76s]  All right. Oh wait, we're gonna fight a clown. Normal.
[8842.76s -> 8852.94s]  I don't care if this guy dies. Just kill him. Just batarang him in the head.
[8852.94s -> 8859.50s]  Try something else. Anything else will do.
[8859.50s -> 8868.01s]  Anything will do. Both of you. I think we froze to death down here.
[8868.01s -> 8879.69s]  Would you like to interrogate? Yes. Location.
[8880.09s -> 8888.33s]  Where can I find your boss? He'll be visiting the bank tonight making a withdrawal.
[8889.05s -> 8901.46s]  Okay. I'll be sure to stop him.
[8922.54s -> 8927.34s]  Bank. Where's the bank? Where's the bank? Mayor's office downtown.
[8928.06s -> 8943.94s]  Gotham Plaza. Fish market. Where's the bank? Is the bank on this side or the other side?
[8944.74s -> 8957.83s]  Jewelry. Do the music louder or am I fucking insane?
[8957.83s -> 8964.79s]  You might not be insane. I think it just hurts to listen to this or it just
[8964.79s -> 8982.12s]  feels like it's getting louder. Bank. 750... Am I early? I'm too early.
[8985.88s -> 9001.66s]  759. Is this real time? 801. Is it eight? What time did they do this?
[9001.66s -> 9015.06s]  I can skip time? How do you do that?
[9020.47s -> 9024.15s]  Advance. An hour. Two hours. Return to game.
[9024.71s -> 9038.25s]  All right. Are they here? Let's go. It's 10... 11 o'clock.
[9042.94s -> 9053.94s]  Here we go. It's the penguin. He's a cunt. Quick throw a batarang in his eye.
[9055.32s -> 9058.36s]  He blocked it. Fierce. Get in there. Get in there and stop punching.
[9061.03s -> 9065.91s]  Why is the penguin this good at fighting? The penguin's not supposed to be this good.
[9067.14s -> 9071.93s]  Fierce. Get in there, Batman. Take him out. All right. A couple more of those.
[9072.73s -> 9075.13s]  Why is he here by himself walking in the front door?
[9081.58s -> 9086.71s]  Don't you think you would do something differently here in Justice 3?
[9090.07s -> 9096.39s]  All right. Please don't lose this. How many punches in the face is the penguin gonna take?
[9108.87s -> 9115.93s]  End this. Don't let him get the best of you. If the penguin can beat Batman in a one-on-one
[9115.93s -> 9127.21s]  combat scenario, it might be time to retire. There you go. Get in.
[9127.21s -> 9157.03s]  Is Fierce the... Okay. His top henchmen. Here come the clowns. Why can I do this so well?
[9157.03s -> 9161.51s]  I just... I did a backflip off of his face. I'm doing like weird karate mortal combat
[9161.51s -> 9166.07s]  moves and shit now. I was afraid... Look at these moves. Why was I not doing these before?
[9177.59s -> 9184.92s]  Oh, would you like to interrogate? Yes. I want the location.
[9184.92s -> 9191.24s]  I want your boss. Where is he? Where is he?
[9192.52s -> 9195.96s]  I don't know, but he'll be making a withdrawal later tonight at the bank.
[9195.96s -> 9206.42s]  Later tonight? At the bank? Okay. Where is he? What time is it? 1130? Okay.
[9220.87s -> 9224.86s]  Uh-oh. Mirror match. I chose...
[9228.62s -> 9233.18s]  That was a backflip. I punched you so hard you did a full backflip.
[9239.19s -> 9248.94s]  This is an old lady. This is clearly a grandma. Just push her over. Push her. Just shove.
[9249.66s -> 9259.27s]  What's this? What's going on? Why is this blinking red? Why is my stone blinking?
[9260.66s -> 9270.54s]  What does this mean? Is this a bomb? No. I don't know what that means. I have to wait at the bank.
[9271.26s -> 9278.98s]  What time is it? It's 1150. He's going to make a withdrawal. I just have to hold on.
[9279.54s -> 9296.39s]  All right. Wait an hour. Okay. Here comes the withdrawal. Here we go. Here he comes.
[9297.59s -> 9305.66s]  I came back. I forgot. I was going to deposit a few checks too, Batman.
[9306.38s -> 9322.55s]  Bruce, you might want to do something here. Bruce, get in there. Easy. Should I put it on easy?
[9323.43s -> 9337.51s]  No, this is too defensive. Get in there. Normal. You are so bad. Fierce. At least you were
[9337.51s -> 9351.82s]  landing shots. How many times do I have to hit him? I think I have to put... Okay. I know
[9351.82s -> 9354.94s]  what I have to do. I got to put it on easy when he attacks because that means I block
[9355.90s -> 9377.26s]  and then go back to fierce. What a bullshit strategy that's working. It's not fair.
[9377.26s -> 9381.82s]  Look at that reach. Batman, do something. Anything would be... I would take anything at
[9381.82s -> 9398.60s]  this point. I'm just relying on dodge rolls. Get in there. Finally. Punch. Oh my god.
[9409.27s -> 9413.46s]  Where is he? Oh, he's going to be making a deposit later tonight.
[9414.26s -> 9433.06s]  It's fucking 12 30. Batman's going on no sleep. No, they're gone. All right. Back to the... I
[9433.06s -> 9461.40s]  gotta watch the videotape. Put the tape in. Let's see what it is. Remember that time when
[9461.40s -> 9470.54s]  Batman fought the penguin for three hours outside of a bank twice? Okay. Video. Select
[9470.54s -> 9479.86s]  video. No, do I have to administer evidence? Okay. Enter evidence. Red triangle circus
[9479.86s -> 9492.68s]  poster videotape from zoo. Collected evidence. Entered. Video from the zoo. Play. My god.
[9493.24s -> 9504.33s]  The penguin man of the sewers. What? Shut up Max. You know you and I have a lot in common.
[9505.48s -> 9517.08s]  We do? Of course. We both crave respect and power. You can never have too much power.
[9517.08s -> 9525.11s]  You're right. I've been hiding in the sewers for too long. It's time for me to ascend.
[9526.78s -> 9534.07s]  And I want your help. I think I can work out a welcome home scenario that will benefit both of us.
[9539.10s -> 9545.37s]  Transmit to the police. Wait, who am I transmitting to? Am I putting this on TV?
[9546.25s -> 9565.50s]  Did I just pump into every cable box? Quick, put it on the air. It'll embarrass them. I guess
[9565.50s -> 9576.06s]  I'm transmitting this. Yeah, why were they recording this? Why would you re record your
[9576.06s -> 9586.58s]  damning conversation? Yeah, they're standing very okay. I did it. I transmitted it. Apparently.
[9587.14s -> 9595.50s]  We've got big bits coming in. Cure. Cure, thank you for the $55. Cure. 55 bucks.
[9596.79s -> 9603.48s]  Huge money drop right here. Cure says, hey, I love it when you play shitty old games. Brings
[9603.48s -> 9607.64s]  me back. You're me and my brother's favorite person on the internet. I've been watching
[9607.64s -> 9612.01s]  you for a long time and it seems like you just keep getting funnier. Keep being you. As long
[9612.01s -> 9615.21s]  as you having fun. We always are right there with you laughing our asses off.
[9615.21s -> 9618.25s]  Thanks for the years of free laughs. Here's me giving back a little. Thank you so much.
[9622.01s -> 9630.39s]  That means a fucking lot. Thank you. It's my pleasure. And yes, I do have a lot of fun
[9630.39s -> 9641.05s]  when we play these games. Thank you so much Cure. Say hello to your brother for me too.
[9641.29s -> 9649.86s]  So, and that Batman music just like blasting in the background.
[9649.86s -> 9657.51s]  All right, I get this is gonna drive you crazy. Um, videotaping is one of the two
[9657.51s -> 9661.43s]  principals apparently likes to keep a video record of his meetings. They have formed
[9661.43s -> 9665.99s]  an alliance and appear ready to use devious means to gain power. When he videotapes
[9665.99s -> 9673.11s]  every meeting, I would not be okay with that. There are many rumors linking the red triangle
[9673.11s -> 9676.39s]  circus to criminal activity. It's likely that at least some of the members turn to crime
[9677.03s -> 9679.99s]  full-time with the circus characters involved in the ride of the plaza.
[9680.55s -> 9688.58s]  Let's see what's on the news today. Another La Crona just gave 50 dollars.
[9691.21s -> 9695.77s]  Oswald Cobblepot foiled a kidnap attempt on the mayor. Little is known about Cobblepot's
[9695.77s -> 9699.53s]  background. He appears to suffer from a congenital deformity that gives him a very
[9699.53s -> 9706.82s]  penguin-like appearance. The arctic weather which has left Gothamites numb, depressed,
[9706.82s -> 9713.83s]  and weary. What? Now we're going in this loop again. Uh, La Crona says eject. 50 dollars.
[9713.83s -> 9727.54s]  Thank you. Back-to-back 50 bucks. Thank you, both of you. Uh, okay. Let's- I'm not gonna eject.
[9728.10s -> 9734.07s]  I'm gonna go to the vault. I could- I have to replace my bat suit. This one's broken.
[9734.63s -> 9749.99s]  See, look. Ready? 100 percent, 100 percent, right? 70- Offensive capability zero. What do
[9749.99s -> 9761.13s]  you mean zero? Is this suit made out of concrete? I don't get it. Wait, there's a
[9761.13s -> 9775.37s]  link that I need to look at? You went too hard. Hold on. Wait, a link I need to look at. Wait,
[9775.37s -> 9793.14s]  wait, wait. What's the link? You even put my nose bump in that photo- in the image.
[9795.54s -> 9807.45s]  That's the best part about that. All right, here we go. We need to go to sleep. I'm
[9807.45s -> 9814.06s]  gonna give this game like another 15 minutes. I don't know how much more of this I can take.
[9828.01s -> 9835.03s]  Okay, and we have the mayor's house. Gotham Plaza mayor's office.
[9836.23s -> 9845.27s]  We're gonna go to the mayor's office. What time is it? 6 p.m. He's not here. Just wait here.
[9846.90s -> 9861.70s]  Oh, hold on. Party pictures. Scan. Scan them. Scan. Just take them. All right, I got some
[9861.70s -> 9877.35s]  evidence here. All right, get me the fuck out of this. I don't want to look at his desk
[9877.35s -> 9901.96s]  anymore. Okay, pictures. What's in the pictures? Does he take photos of himself, too? Is it weird
[9901.96s -> 9907.77s]  that I want to do this again on the next stream? I feel like we're just touching the ice break
[9907.77s -> 9925.93s]  here. Evidence. Oh, maybe like do it next weekend, too? Okay, uh, enter. Photos of
[9925.93s -> 9939.74s]  the mayor's son. A pack of photos of the mayor's son's birthday party. No useful extrapolation
[9939.74s -> 9950.22s]  can be made at this time. I think, I think we've, I don't know what to do.
[9951.10s -> 9956.76s]  I don't know what else to do. Watch the news. Unemployment. No, we already know about the
[9956.76s -> 9974.58s]  unemployment. No, not the SATs again. What the hell is there a reason for the eject button?
[9974.58s -> 9979.54s]  There is no reason for the eject button. It doesn't, it just explodes the car. All right,
[9980.34s -> 9987.38s]  last day. Make it count. Gotham Zoo. Batcave. Mayor's office. Downtown.
[9988.10s -> 10015.58s]  Fish market. Let's go downtown. Nobody here. Steal something. I can't. I'm Batman. Batman
[10015.58s -> 10023.26s]  doesn't steal. What about over here? We saw a light just turn off there. Down to the street.
[10023.90s -> 10029.06s]  If there's nothing here, then we're going to move on. I don't think this, I think,
[10029.06s -> 10035.66s]  I think we're stuck. We have to do something specific. Yeah, I think that's it. I think
[10035.66s -> 10043.80s]  that's it. It was fun. One more try. I'm going to go to the fish market.
[10044.52s -> 10058.63s]  They closed. Ah, damn it. What time is it? 8 58. They close at nine. Bullshit. God,
[10058.63s -> 10087.24s]  I drove all the way out here. Fuck it. Well, that's it for that one. Well, thank you,
[10087.24s -> 10092.89s]  Batman Returns for the, probably the hardest I've laughed in two or three weeks at least.
[10093.69s -> 10317.26s]  That was a classic. I am going to go pee. I'll be right back. Hello. So, yeah, I think
[10320.23s -> 10331.02s]  uh, what do you guys think? This is what I think. It's uh, 4,400 games. That's uh,
[10333.30s -> 10344.42s]  I feel like we could make this like a Saturday night thing. You know what I'm saying? At least
[10344.42s -> 10350.14s]  for like a couple weeks. Just do I have to have this be just something fun to do like
[10350.14s -> 10364.92s]  Saturday night? Just to check out some old DOS games, you know, whatever. On top of other
[10364.92s -> 10371.45s]  streams, right? Because this, this is four this week. So I don't see why I wouldn't do this
[10371.45s -> 10379.74s]  again. This is fucking, no, I'm having, this is a lot of fun. Maybe not permanently,
[10379.74s -> 10385.56s]  but at least for like the next maybe two or three weeks. Try it. But uh, speaking of stuff,
[10385.56s -> 10395.85s]  I, here we go. We were, uh, we did not choose to scroll. We were right here.
[10395.85s -> 10401.67s]  The last one was Batman, right? We didn't choose to scroll. Was it here or was it,
[10401.67s -> 10414.62s]  it was here, right? Uh, let's keep going. Probably gonna drop a lot of frames.
[10415.99s -> 10421.46s]  Another reason why I started an hour or two early, because I'm trying to beat the internet problems
[10421.46s -> 10427.67s]  that start at like five to six, seven o'clock. So at this point, we're probably going to start
[10427.67s -> 10435.34s]  dropping frames. Apologize in advance, but let me get the thing here. If you want to scroll
[10436.06s -> 10453.58s]  down another set of pages. Here we go. Are you ready? Click the screen. Don't use the image.
[10455.99s -> 10459.67s]  I'll, I'll make it something else after this. Just so people like, oh, I'm going to click the face,
[10459.67s -> 10472.04s]  right? I see what you're saying. Here, while you guys do that, I'll do this.
[10499.22s -> 10512.66s]  This means scroll. So, uh, what are we doing here? I think we're scrolling. I think we're
[10512.66s -> 10529.69s]  doing a scroll. We are. Stop it for now. We're doing one full scroll to here, which
[10529.69s -> 10537.59s]  gives us this new set. And let's wait, wait, wait, rigged, rigged, what time? Wait, what
[10537.59s -> 10549.62s]  happened? Rigged. What are you talking about? Was it, it was 30, like three percent, right?
[10549.62s -> 10567.83s]  Hold on. Did I, did I fuck that up? 70% was not voting. Reset the vote. Okay. No, no,
[10567.83s -> 10570.55s]  you're right. Okay. Okay. All right. I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying. No,
[10570.55s -> 10579.46s]  I see what you're saying. You're right. No, you're right. You're right. You're right.
[10579.46s -> 10592.06s]  Because I, there are people that may have just clicked the face. Well, if there was
[10592.70s -> 10604.55s]  ever any indication of what people wanted, I think we've got a clear indicator now.
[10604.55s -> 10618.68s]  I don't think this is one guy. I think this might be, uh, 58% of all one guys in the chat.
[10618.68s -> 10635.83s]  58% of guys. All right. That's very clear. Let's go again here. All right. By the way,
[10635.83s -> 10648.15s]  this is off. I'm not doing this one. X. X that one. I'm not doing that one either.
[10648.15s -> 10663.37s]  Not doing, not doing that one. Good thing I caught that. No way. Not playing soft porn,
[10663.37s -> 10677.08s]  too. You're wasting your vote right now. We must know. And my channel, if you understand,
[10677.08s -> 10683.69s]  I can't stream porn on Twitch. I don't know if you've ever read the terms of service,
[10683.69s -> 10692.10s]  but porno porn is not streamable. Uh, even if it is probably like two bits that are,
[10695.43s -> 10703.24s]  it's just text. You think I can roll those dice? I don't know what that is. It could be
[10703.24s -> 10713.50s]  like a good flashing image of like something crazy. No, I ain't clicking that. I'm not clicking on
[10713.50s -> 10722.71s]  porn. Now you got, I'm telling, that's it. Monopoly Deluxe is the winner. No, no, no, no.
[10722.71s -> 10733.80s]  Sorry. Sorry. Sim Ant. I already played Sim Ant. No, Veto, two Vetos. I played Sim Ant like
[10733.80s -> 10741.62s]  three weeks ago. No, I played Sim Ant like a year ago. You want me to play Sim Ant again?
[10742.58s -> 10752.22s]  All right. All right. Well, I'll put up Sim Ant. That's the one. I'm not clicking the porn one.
[10753.66s -> 10762.17s]  Three weeks is a year. No porn. All it takes is for one thing to flash on that screen.
[10762.73s -> 10768.81s]  And bingo. I'll see you guys in two weeks because I get terms of service banned.
[10773.90s -> 10782.82s]  Sim Ant. We're not going to report you. All right. Sim Ant. This copy of Sim Ant is
[10782.82s -> 10796.52s]  registered to Robert. I don't know who that is. That's not me. Stolen.
[10811.34s -> 10819.37s]  I don't know how to play tutorial. Welcome to the Sim Ant tutorial. Just follow the on-screen
[10819.37s -> 10825.98s]  instructions and you will learn how to play the game. All right. In Sim Ant, you are the
[10825.98s -> 10830.38s]  yellow ant that you see in the window before you. First, you will learn to control your ant.
[10831.26s -> 10837.35s]  Try double clicking somewhere in the brown dirt near the yellow ant.
[10838.15s -> 10846.07s]  Is that the queen? Good. You've just learned how to dig a tunnel. Try digging some more to get the
[10846.07s -> 10866.86s]  hang of it. What's wrong? What are you doing? Now go outside and explore the surface. Double
[10866.86s -> 10869.58s]  click on the blue area at the top of the window to dig a tunnel to the surface.
[10870.38s -> 10878.12s]  Oh, shit. Okay. Now you're outside. This is called the surface view. You can die up here.
[10878.76s -> 10885.69s]  To move in the surface, just click on the ground and you'll move. All right. Yeah, I can
[10885.69s -> 10900.87s]  move around. When do we get raid? Hey. Hey, easy. That's right. Now click on your ant to
[10900.87s -> 10911.54s]  re-send to the window. Just go off on an adventure. Good. Now here's another way to scroll the screen.
[10911.54s -> 10927.61s]  Move the mouse cursor to the far edge of the screen. Yep. Yep. Yep. Oh, boy. Now it's about
[10927.61s -> 10943.43s]  time to find some food for your colony. Under the window menu, select MAP. The window is a
[10943.43s -> 10948.62s]  view of the whole patch. The green dots in this window are food. The yellow dot is your
[10948.62s -> 10956.68s]  ant. You may see other things moving too. Eject. Get a bearing on which way the food
[10956.68s -> 10960.60s]  is located in the patch. Then select edit under the window menu to bring up the close-up
[10960.60s -> 10970.50s]  view of the surface again. All right. So I gotta go right. They're gonna go this way. There it is.
[10971.22s -> 10972.57s]  Try to get some of the food.
[10986.01s -> 10991.34s]  All right. I got the food. Very good. You made it. You are probably hungry by now,
[10991.34s -> 11000.73s]  so double click on a piece of food. That tasted good, didn't it? Now you feel like a new ant.
[11001.29s -> 11007.86s]  Now it's time to bring a piece of food back to your colony. Double click on another
[11007.86s -> 11011.38s]  piece of food. Pick it up. Would you guys just let me get through the damn tutorial?
[11017.08s -> 11022.68s]  What? Like, let me just at least do that. This is what was voted on. You have to give it at least
[11022.68s -> 11028.68s]  a few minutes. We can't just be like, I want you to play SimAnt. Get out of SimAnt quick.
[11029.90s -> 11036.87s]  You put me to sleep. All right. So I have a piece of food. We voted for soft porn. Yeah.
[11036.87s -> 11041.80s]  All right. You know, that's true. You're right. You wanted soft porn too. I'm gonna do it.
[11041.80s -> 11051.32s]  I'm gonna turn the screen off and I'm gonna see what it is. What was that? Now pick up
[11051.32s -> 11058.36s]  the food. Wait, watch out. He's coming after me. He's coming after me. He's chasing me.
[11058.36s -> 11078.54s]  Hit the food up. All right. I need a map. Where's the colony? I don't remember what my
[11078.54s -> 11084.73s]  colony is. It's up here. Colony. Found it. Good. Try to get back to your nest. It should
[11084.73s -> 11093.34s]  be somewhere to the left. Yeah, it's right here. All right. I got food. Food. This is
[11093.34s -> 11104.62s]  food for you. Double click the tunnel to drop the food. Try a few more things. Just hold
[11104.62s -> 11107.58s]  on. I'm interested in it for a second. You're gonna get your porn game in a few minutes.
[11107.58s -> 11124.33s]  Hold on. Look for a small rock that looks like this. This is cool. Build crude walls
[11125.13s -> 11131.82s]  for defense. A shitload of them just showed up. Click and hold on your ant and select recruit
[11132.54s -> 11145.00s]  10 from the pop-up menu. Recruit 10. I got. Oh yeah. You thought this was gonna be boring?
[11145.64s -> 11162.44s]  Take a look at this. I got an army now. We're gonna go fight the red ants. Where's
[11162.44s -> 11169.35s]  their colony? Tap the zero key. No. I want to see where they are. There they are. Let's go.
[11170.07s -> 11179.43s]  Let's fuck them up. Let's get in there. Just get the queen immediately.
[11179.43s -> 11201.51s]  In. Invade. Invade. I'll find another. You have been reborn and the stream continues.
[11208.55s -> 11230.98s]  All right. Sim ant. Sim ant. Sim ant. Never gonna stop playing this. This drops a cent.
[11230.98s -> 11250.78s]  Sim ant. Sim ant. Sim ant. Never going to stop streaming. Sim ant. Engage. Engage. Exchange
[11250.78s -> 11263.82s]  bodies. Now you're in. You control any black ant with this command. Okay. What's this thing?
[11263.82s -> 11276.89s]  Can we kill this thing? All right. Back to the map. Okay. You got one more minute here
[11276.89s -> 11286.97s]  for me just to check it out. This game's cool. You guys don't like this game?
[11286.97s -> 11294.12s]  Where you are in the world of Sim Ant. Click on the yard icon. Oh shit. This is somebody's
[11294.12s -> 11305.86s]  yard. You can only transfer to a new patch in a full game. This plans for zombies. We're
[11305.86s -> 11312.66s]  going to invade the house. The screen is where you will reproduce and spread new
[11312.66s -> 11321.62s]  colonies across the yard. Just watch out for the lawnmower. Now click on the bottom labeled
[11321.62s -> 11330.98s]  house. Can we infest the house? Guys, we can infest the house. You're objectively to invade
[11330.98s -> 11355.02s]  and take over the inside of this house. You don't. Okay. That's pretty cool. Okay. B. Behavior
[11355.02s -> 11371.34s]  control. Dig. One minute. It's got like 30 seconds left. This is really cool. I highly recommend
[11371.34s -> 11391.58s]  Sim Ant. This is fun. This is actually pretty cool. Now let's play porn. Oh, they're coming
[11391.58s -> 11395.78s]  to steal our food. Wait a minute. I can't stand for this. Look, they're taking all
[11395.78s -> 11403.11s]  of our food. Get over here. How do I? Oh, I get this is my last thing I'm doing. No,
[11403.11s -> 11414.22s]  I don't. Hold on. Wait. Recruit 10. Get over here. More. Recruit 10. There's only one
[11414.22s -> 11426.76s]  here. They're taking all of our food. Get over there. There we go. All right. Charge
[11426.76s -> 11439.30s]  in. Let's go. Get them. Scare them off. Come on. All of you. Somebody fight this guy
[11439.30s -> 11450.90s]  so I don't. I've been reborn. The counter resets. No, this is all right. This is
[11450.90s -> 11459.18s]  fun. I like it. Next. That's fun. The red ants are too powerful. It's okay. Get
[11459.18s -> 11463.99s]  that off screen. This is fun. This is cool. I recommend it. Go play it and tell me how
[11463.99s -> 11468.78s]  it is. I'm going to click the porn game now. I'm going to turn the audio off. I need
[11468.78s -> 11477.26s]  to. I'm just going to see what this is. Okay. I'm clicking on soft porn 2. I'm
[11477.26s -> 11492.22s]  opening soft porn 2. Okay. Hit any key. This program contains explicit material
[11492.22s -> 11500.39s]  that may be found offensive. Are you over 18? Do you wish to continue? Do you
[11500.39s -> 11527.64s]  need instructions? I can't show this. There's a whole list of commands. Just
[11527.64s -> 11532.28s]  say what's on screen. Well, the program collects relevant information regarding
[11532.28s -> 11536.94s]  you and your partner. You direct the action by giving commands such as
[11542.49s -> 11557.14s]  something. Have her something something. Have her something my wand. Don't get
[11557.14s -> 11563.34s]  discouraged if you wipe out on the first couple tries. This is much more
[11563.34s -> 11570.12s]  complex and much more difficult than soft porn 1. There are 22 different
[11570.12s -> 11583.37s]  endings and only one is the real winner. All right. How about this? I will show
[11583.37s -> 11597.29s]  you guys the TV edit of this game. Okay. Here comes the TV edit and hold on.
[11597.29s -> 11607.18s]  Vilemi gave $53. Forget soft porn 2. Give us Jazz Jackrabbit. Thank you for
[11607.18s -> 11617.43s]  the 53 bucks. We're going to do the made for TV soft porn 2. Okay. What is
[11617.43s -> 11636.62s]  your name in this story? I'm not using my real name. Dave. Yes. Um, I
[11636.62s -> 11648.46s]  don't know. Uh, Cindy. Carol. Carol. What color is Carol's hair? Um, I don't
[11648.46s -> 11667.83s]  know. Uh, bra bra brown. Brown. The color of Carol's eyes. Uh, red. What
[11667.83s -> 11696.42s]  is Carol's? Um, I don't know. I don't see what. Um, I don't I don't I don't
[11696.74s -> 11707.99s]  know. Seven, eight, 19. I don't know what that means. 19. Uh, one. I don't
[11707.99s -> 11718.90s]  know. I, why do they want, am I tailoring a suit for this person? I
[11718.90s -> 11738.23s]  don't. Um, 32. If you want a freak show, go to the circus. Well, one.
[11738.23s -> 11748.34s]  What is Carol's hair? I don't know. Eight, six, five, four. What is this?
[11748.34s -> 11760.79s]  What is Carol? 19 waist measurement. Six hip measurement. Six. I don't know
[11760.79s -> 11766.79s]  measurements. I don't know. I don't know what it is. I know I'm a 32. What
[11766.79s -> 11769.75s]  is Carol's bust measurement? I don't know. I've never measured a bust
[11769.75s -> 11778.10s]  before. 40. What is Carol's waist? I don't know. Girls have different.
[11778.10s -> 11784.78s]  It's different. Like a six, right? It's like zero to six.
[11787.70s -> 11800.87s]  Kim. Is Carol creative? Uh, sure. Is Carol domineering? I don't know what
[11800.87s -> 11805.91s]  that means. No. Is she discreet? Yes. Is she expressive? Yes. Are you
[11805.91s -> 11809.99s]  expressive? Yes. Is Carol intuitive? Yes. Are you talkative? Yes. Are you
[11809.99s -> 11816.79s]  easily aroused? Ah! No. Yes. No. Is Cal, I don't know. No. Is
[11816.79s -> 11820.79s]  Cal proud for breasts? Uh, yes. Are you...
[11821.75s -> 11825.74s]  All right. All right. That's the end of that one.
[11838.41s -> 11852.06s]  What the fuck does this mean? That's all I can handle at the moment. If
[11852.06s -> 11869.94s]  something comes up, ha ha, I'll be in touch. Ha ha. What does that mean? I
[11869.94s -> 11873.45s]  can't. Okay. I'm going to read this because I don't want it on the
[11873.45s -> 11876.06s]  screen because I'm going to replace words.
[11876.30s -> 11892.20s]  Uh, there's, there's no doubt about it. You are, uh, you're dominated
[11892.20s -> 11902.34s]  by a sense of want and lust. Uh, you, you, uh, as you pace the
[11902.34s -> 11911.43s]  streets of Hoboken. Hoboken? Sir, you deeply, almost, you're almost
[11911.43s -> 11916.63s]  unbearable horniness. I'm done. There's so much here that I can't
[11916.63s -> 11944.12s]  read. It's infidelity here. She has a husband. All right. Where
[11944.12s -> 11955.54s]  should we go? Carol asks. The circus. That doesn't sound quite
[11955.54s -> 11965.75s]  right to me, Dave. Where should we go? Uh, I think, I think we
[11965.75s -> 11975.50s]  should bed. I think we bar. Bar. That doesn't sound quite
[11975.50s -> 11984.20s]  right to me, Dave. Where should we go? Applebee's. That doesn't
[11984.68s -> 11996.20s]  sound right to me, Dave. Bed. Um, train.
[12009.24s -> 12013.24s]  Carol becomes bored by your inability to handle the situation
[12013.24s -> 12015.88s]  and leaves. You will never see her again, but sometimes she
[12015.88s -> 12019.85s]  sends a Christmas card. You really blew it, Dave. I said,
[12019.85s -> 12022.33s]  let's go to the bar. Let's go to the Applebee's. Let's go
[12022.33s -> 12026.07s]  to the club. Let's go to bed. What? How many more
[12026.07s -> 12056.55s]  things? What? Should I say bowling? I, wait, I can do it.
[12056.55s -> 12078.98s]  We don't go. Oh, she left. She left. Oh, but there was soft
[12078.98s -> 12081.77s]  porn too. You got it. It was a lot of fucked up shit. I
[12081.77s -> 12085.77s]  couldn't read. You got your, got it. There it is. There's
[12085.77s -> 12098.78s]  your made for TV version. Let us go back. Shall we? All
[12098.78s -> 12104.60s]  right. So that was here, right? Uh, that's correct,
[12104.60s -> 12110.22s]  right? We didn't move on from here. All right. Ladies and
[12110.22s -> 12114.30s]  gentlemen, if you could do me a favor and put your mouse
[12114.30s -> 12116.30s]  over the screen in a certain place. The red arrow
[12116.30s -> 12130.39s]  means you want to scroll down another page. Good luck.
[12130.39s -> 12139.66s]  Hmm. Interesting. Interesting selection. Uh, question for
[12139.66s -> 12142.62s]  the audience here. Do I have to play a full round of
[12142.62s -> 12151.74s]  Monopoly? Why would you want me to do that? Is that you
[12151.74s -> 12157.24s]  want me to? Okay, hold on. A third of you guys want me
[12157.24s -> 12162.44s]  to play a full round of Monopoly like a 25 year old
[12162.44s -> 12171.13s]  version by myself versus the computer. That can't be
[12171.13s -> 12175.99s]  right. I just, that can't be right. I don't think that
[12175.99s -> 12184.18s]  can't, that can't be right. That is correct. Yes.
[12184.18s -> 12191.61s]  Democracy sucks. What do you, what do you mean
[12191.61s -> 12195.62s]  straw poll? There's a interactable straw poll on the
[12195.62s -> 12204.74s]  screen right now. Straw, I just did it. Okay, do a
[12204.74s -> 12217.94s]  straw poll. The people have spoken, guys. I could
[12217.94s -> 12232.36s]  veto it, but I'm toying with the idea. I don't
[12232.36s -> 12236.57s]  understand chat sometimes. I don't understand this
[12236.57s -> 12238.81s]  chat sometimes. No one would actually stay and
[12238.81s -> 12241.29s]  continue talking if a full thing of Monopoly was
[12241.29s -> 12246.09s]  played. You'll get up and leave. You'll get up and
[12246.09s -> 12249.13s]  leave it on in the background, which means you
[12249.13s -> 12251.05s]  aren't fucking watching. If you're here to watch
[12251.05s -> 12255.61s]  someone play a game, pick a game, sit down, shut up
[12255.61s -> 12265.78s]  and watch him play. 65% don't want Monopoly. Yeah,
[12265.78s -> 12267.62s]  but look at all the other, look at, you're evenly
[12267.62s -> 12270.58s]  spread out a bunch of other games. How about this? I
[12270.58s -> 12273.70s]  will at least get, I'll at least go to jail in
[12273.70s -> 12275.30s]  Monopoly. You know what I mean? And we'll get that.
[12275.30s -> 12279.78s]  Don't you be coming back here now. It has
[12279.78s -> 12300.92s]  commenced. Monopoly. Okay. If I gave 15 minutes to
[12300.92s -> 12303.64s]  SimAnt, I will give 10 to Monopoly. There's
[12303.64s -> 12305.32s]  going to be like a five round Monopoly. They
[12305.32s -> 12310.17s]  always do it like this. Watch. I can pick the
[12310.17s -> 12312.17s]  amount of rounds, right? Well, this isn't Mario
[12312.17s -> 12317.83s]  Party. What? This one always works. All right,
[12317.83s -> 12326.09s]  let's go. How do I play? Monopoly. Go. New
[12326.09s -> 12331.51s]  game. All right. Player setup. I'm going to be
[12331.51s -> 12338.84s]  the guy in the green car. This is a human. XT
[12338.84s -> 12342.68s]  clone. 386 30. Okay. Why? Why can I play
[12342.68s -> 12346.60s]  against a microwave? Human, a calculator, a
[12346.60s -> 12359.66s]  computer or a microwave? Okay. Take 500. This
[12359.66s -> 12361.82s]  is going to be the calculator. Give. What
[12361.82s -> 12368.14s]  does this mean? Take five. What does this
[12368.14s -> 12373.96s]  mean? Zoom out. Oh, fuck. What does this
[12374.04s -> 12385.45s]  take 500? Give dice. I don't remember this
[12385.45s -> 12389.02s]  being part of the rules. Do I just drag
[12389.02s -> 12408.71s]  him out? Give. I'm human. Player setup. How
[12408.71s -> 12416.44s]  do I add the player? Zoom back in. No.
[12416.44s -> 12420.63s]  What? This is, what do you mean this is
[12420.63s -> 12421.99s]  too advanced? Does anybody else figure
[12421.99s -> 12424.89s]  this out? What's it? Whoa, what's doing?
[12424.89s -> 12430.04s]  He's coming out of the fucking ground.
[12430.04s -> 12433.00s]  What? Why is it the ghost Monopoly man?
[12433.00s -> 12435.24s]  How do I do that? I just want to add
[12435.24s -> 12457.80s]  the player. No sound. You rolled and now
[12457.80s -> 12474.39s]  you can move. Three. What? Anybody know
[12474.39s -> 12484.25s]  what's going on? Why do I get to roll
[12484.25s -> 12509.80s]  again? Four. The distinctive design of the
[12509.80s -> 12511.00s]  game board is whether it's each of the
[12511.00s -> 12512.28s]  distinctive pieces and elements of the
[12512.28s -> 12513.40s]  board. The pieces in the board
[12513.40s -> 12514.84s]  Monopoly are trademarks of Parker
[12514.84s -> 12516.20s]  Brothers Division of Tonka Corporation
[12516.20s -> 12517.48s]  for its real estate trading game and
[12517.48s -> 12526.87s]  the game equipment. I don't want to see
[12526.87s -> 12528.23s]  any more. All right. Now we just have
[12528.23s -> 12529.59s]  the credits just popping up on the
[12529.59s -> 12536.14s]  screen forever. Now what? Wait. I think
[12536.14s -> 12538.84s]  it is out of them. Human? Just make
[12538.84s -> 12540.84s]  them all. Who cares? We're going to
[12540.84s -> 12543.13s]  bet. I got it. I know what I'm doing.
[12543.13s -> 12544.33s]  I got it. I know it. Are we ready?
[12544.33s -> 12548.76s]  Watch this.
[12548.76s -> 12550.12s]  They're all going to be calculators.
[12550.12s -> 12554.09s]  Start. Got it. I got it. And we're going
[12554.09s -> 12555.53s]  to put a hat on.
[12555.53s -> 12557.29s]  And we're going to do a dog. They're
[12557.29s -> 12558.81s]  all going to. Okay. Bet. How many
[12558.81s -> 12559.85s]  people can you play? How many people can
[12559.85s -> 12562.86s]  play Monopoly?
[12562.86s -> 12564.78s]  You can't have fucking 10 people play
[12564.78s -> 12604.25s]  Monopoly. Why does he keep waking up
[12604.25s -> 12605.05s]  out of bed?
[12605.05s -> 12608.02s]  Hold on. Is there speed? It's got to
[12608.02s -> 12618.82s]  be speed, right?
[12618.82s -> 12650.78s]  Fast computers. Let's go. I can't even
[12650.78s -> 12653.02s]  do a one-minute game.
[12653.02s -> 12654.86s]  Well, how did I just add? I just
[12654.86s -> 12656.46s]  added players in the middle of
[12656.46s -> 12660.02s]  Monopoly and made it a one-minute game.
[12660.02s -> 12671.18s]  You can't do that. There we go. All
[12671.18s -> 12673.75s]  right. One minute. Who wins? There's like
[12673.75s -> 12680.89s]  30 pieces on the board. It's just like
[12680.89s -> 12685.99s]  you have the whole family come over.
[12685.99s -> 12688.31s]  Everybody gets to play. This fucking
[12688.31s -> 12689.91s]  30 pieces on the board.
[12689.91s -> 12697.75s]  It's like a D&D campaign. The game's
[12697.75s -> 12698.79s]  limit has been reached. The player with
[12698.79s -> 12700.15s]  the highest total assets wins the
[12700.15s -> 12701.90s]  game. Who won?
[12701.90s -> 12704.78s]  Congratulations, dog. You have the
[12704.78s -> 12707.35s]  most assets.
[12707.35s -> 12708.95s]  It just picked a random person that
[12708.95s -> 12712.33s]  didn't get to roll.
[12712.33s -> 12717.14s]  Dog takes victory lap. Good job, dog.
[12717.14s -> 12740.01s]  Well, this was terrible. Please vote
[12740.01s -> 12747.64s]  again. Vilemi.
[12747.64s -> 12750.78s]  50 more dollars from Vilemi. Oh, fuck.
[12750.78s -> 12754.22s]  Hold on. Stop.
[12754.22s -> 12758.06s]  Uh, ignore these Philistines. Play Jazz
[12758.06s -> 12760.76s]  Jackrabbit. That's not up to me. If it
[12760.76s -> 12762.68s]  were up to me, I would have played
[12762.68s -> 12765.56s]  uh, soft porn 2 for the next 12 hours.
[12765.56s -> 12779.62s]  It's not up to me. Holy shit. Really?
[12779.62s -> 12790.09s]  You're enabling them.
[12790.09s -> 12798.22s]  Lost to a calculator. Uh-oh. The Jazz
[12798.22s -> 12802.30s]  Jackrabbit votes are getting divided.
[12802.30s -> 12804.70s]  Jazz Jackrabbit and Jazz Jackrabbit
[12804.70s -> 12808.50s]  holiday hair in 1995.
[12808.50s -> 12814.38s]  So, um, you guys, you gotta come to a
[12814.38s -> 12815.74s]  consensus here.
[12815.74s -> 12820.22s]  So that's 20, that's 19, 29, 30,
[12820.22s -> 12822.22s]  that's 12, like 40 percent want a
[12822.22s -> 12837.56s]  version of Jazz Jackrabbit.
[12837.56s -> 12841.24s]  You guys, just, you got, why do half of
[12841.24s -> 12842.76s]  you want to see?
[12842.76s -> 12852.44s]  Uh, you guys gotta work together.
[12852.44s -> 12862.76s]  You split the vote.
[12871.21s -> 12873.61s]  We're scrolling. I'm sorry, guys, that's
[12873.61s -> 12874.49s]  not,
[12874.49s -> 12883.05s]  that's not how it works. So here's what
[12883.05s -> 12884.66s]  we're going to do.
[12884.66s -> 12886.42s]  Before I turn the stream off, we're
[12886.42s -> 12887.62s]  going to come back and do a final
[12887.62s -> 12889.70s]  vote on Jazz Jackrabbit, uh, or
[12889.70s -> 12892.50s]  Jack, Jack, Jack, Jackrabbit holiday
[12892.50s -> 12893.70s]  hair in 1995.
[12893.70s -> 12899.99s]  We'll do it before we leave. But, uh,
[12899.99s -> 12901.51s]  it's, whatever has the highest score
[12901.51s -> 12903.42s]  and people want to scroll.
[12903.42s -> 12904.78s]  You should have, um, had the
[12904.78s -> 12906.06s]  consensus there, but it's okay. You'll
[12906.06s -> 12907.18s]  have a chance again
[12907.18s -> 12914.76s]  in a little bit. Here we go.
[12914.76s -> 12919.02s]  Split the vote. All right,
[12919.02s -> 12925.64s]  here we are. I think we, uh, yeah, we're
[12925.64s -> 12930.98s]  in the right spot.
[12930.98s -> 12944.26s]  See ya in a second. Please choose. I've
[12944.26s -> 12944.82s]  got
[12944.82s -> 12946.90s]  some votes on Tetris. We have most
[12946.90s -> 12947.86s]  votes on
[12947.86s -> 12954.58s]  Cool World. We also have Mario's Game
[12954.58s -> 12956.18s]  Gallery,
[12956.18s -> 12967.53s]  and we have Ski or Die. Y'all are
[12967.53s -> 12973.67s]  thirsty.
[12973.67s -> 12996.98s]  I can't understand the chat sometimes.
[12996.98s -> 12998.34s]  All right, it looks like we're going to
[12998.34s -> 13000.10s]  be going with Cool World.
[13000.10s -> 13009.05s]  Thank you for voting. A lot of you want
[13009.05s -> 13010.01s]  Cool World.
[13010.01s -> 13012.73s]  We're gonna just have it on in the
[13012.73s -> 13019.46s]  background while he plays.
[13019.46s -> 13022.44s]  All right, let's go. Cool World.
[13022.44s -> 13025.56s]  Wasn't this a movie?
[13025.56s -> 13027.08s]  This is a movie game, right? Is it a
[13027.08s -> 13035.42s]  licensed movie game?
[13035.42s -> 13037.58s]  Ooh, I think it might have crashed. No, not
[13037.58s -> 13046.65s]  quite.
[13046.65s -> 13049.56s]  Blood? Is it Cool World's, the game
[13049.56s -> 13051.16s]  with the, um,
[13051.16s -> 13053.48s]  with the spot, right? The like red dot
[13053.48s -> 13054.44s]  thing?
[13054.44s -> 13060.33s]  The red, is it like the glass, the red
[13060.41s -> 13068.68s]  sunglasses?
[13068.68s -> 13072.41s]  That's a cool spot. All right, what?
[13072.41s -> 13074.25s]  Stop it. Let me go.
[13074.25s -> 13080.70s]  All right, use key. Hold on. Wait, wait.
[13080.70s -> 13082.30s]  Redefine keys.
[13082.30s -> 13084.38s]  Press key for up. Press key for down.
[13084.38s -> 13085.82s]  Press key for left.
[13085.82s -> 13088.78s]  Right. Fire. We'll make it, um,
[13088.78s -> 13090.14s]  I don't know,
[13090.14s -> 13093.18s]  C. Or, uh, yeah, C.
[13093.18s -> 13096.30s]  Pause. Space. Map.
[13096.30s -> 13106.47s]  Uh, M. Here we go. It's Bart Simpson?
[13106.47s -> 13111.38s]  What the fuck? Boss, get over to Spark's
[13111.38s -> 13113.38s]  place as fast as you can. He's trying to
[13113.38s -> 13115.38s]  jump into the real world. You must stop
[13115.38s -> 13116.10s]  him.
[13116.10s -> 13125.24s]  That really is just Bart Simpson. Was
[13125.24s -> 13135.03s]  this, was Bart Simpson in the movie?
[13135.03s -> 13138.30s]  It's just, it's, it's doing oof. This
[13138.30s -> 13139.58s]  is where they got the oof sound
[13139.58s -> 13140.86s]  effect for him.
[13140.86s -> 13158.28s]  This movie was okay, I guess. I don't,
[13158.28s -> 13160.20s]  I don't, I didn't even see the movie.
[13160.20s -> 13169.26s]  And why, why am I dressed like this?
[13169.26s -> 13174.86s]  Has, okay, somebody check. Has anybody
[13174.86s -> 13176.54s]  speed ran this game?
[13176.54s -> 13179.82s]  You're not welcome here, Harris. Ain't
[13179.82s -> 13180.70s]  you got
[13180.70s -> 13182.38s]  some better things to do with your
[13182.38s -> 13183.82s]  time than harassing innocent
[13183.82s -> 13198.46s]  doodles? How am I not welcome?
[13198.46s -> 13200.78s]  He's trying to go to the real world.
[13200.78s -> 13201.98s]  How do I stop him from going to the
[13201.98s -> 13203.26s]  real world?
[13203.26s -> 13211.30s]  You're not welcome. What's with the,
[13211.30s -> 13215.45s]  why are there demon doors?
[13215.45s -> 13220.17s]  You guys got click faded.
[13220.17s -> 13222.01s]  Oh, there's a girl on there. She's
[13222.01s -> 13224.25s]  dancing. Get that one.
[13224.25s -> 13228.42s]  Oh, sorry. It's a side scrolling
[13228.42s -> 13239.21s]  Bart Simpson shooter. Do I need more
[13239.21s -> 13240.33s]  money?
[13240.33s -> 13247.34s]  Money? What about map?
[13247.34s -> 13262.36s]  All right, um, up? I can't go up?
[13262.36s -> 13268.06s]  How the fuck do I get out of here?
[13268.06s -> 13276.52s]  All right, how do you, I gotta go up
[13276.52s -> 13278.12s]  and to the left and
[13278.12s -> 13281.35s]  I can't go up? It looks like I can go
[13281.35s -> 13283.26s]  up from here.
[13283.26s -> 13289.64s]  I can't go this way. Can I go up
[13289.64s -> 13290.92s]  through here?
[13290.92s -> 13295.54s]  Okay, here we go. All right, now we're
[13295.54s -> 13298.09s]  just gonna go right.
[13298.09s -> 13303.05s]  This is the door. I don't like your
[13303.05s -> 13304.49s]  money, Harris, but you've got enough
[13304.49s -> 13310.92s]  of it. Step inside, sucker.
[13310.92s -> 13316.74s]  Um, this is just a Sonic the Hedgehog
[13316.74s -> 13317.86s]  level.
[13317.86s -> 13319.86s]  I remember I hated this level. This is
[13319.86s -> 13321.14s]  like the casino level. This level
[13321.14s -> 13322.02s]  sucked.
[13322.02s -> 13329.21s]  This is the one where you could
[13329.21s -> 13330.97s]  drown and it was really easy to die
[13330.97s -> 13332.33s]  in like five seconds.
[13332.33s -> 13340.78s]  It's a good level. No, no. Wait, am I
[13340.78s -> 13341.98s]  thinking the right one?
[13341.98s -> 13343.66s]  Is that the one where you, it's
[13343.66s -> 13351.64s]  really easy to get trapped and die?
[13351.64s -> 13354.98s]  Real world comic books. No, I'm
[13354.98s -> 13356.02s]  thinking the wrong one. Oh, no, that's
[13356.02s -> 13358.98s]  chemical plant. Oh, that level sucks.
[13358.98s -> 13362.49s]  Can I make it?
[13364.66s -> 13366.18s]  I think, you know, the casino level was
[13366.18s -> 13374.54s]  awesome. I have no idea what the fuck's
[13374.54s -> 13375.18s]  going on.
[13375.18s -> 13379.46s]  I can't open the map anymore? Danger.
[13379.46s -> 13384.78s]  Danger.
[13384.78s -> 13387.18s]  Invalence is too great.
[13387.18s -> 13410.31s]  Did you do me a favor and click on the
[13410.31s -> 13411.43s]  screen where you'd like to see us go
[13411.43s -> 13417.21s]  next?
[13417.21s -> 13418.65s]  Wait, wait, I just influenced it. I
[13418.65s -> 13420.41s]  just, I just, I just, I just, people
[13420.41s -> 13421.53s]  are gonna click on that now. Hold on.
[13421.53s -> 13422.49s]  Wait, I just influenced it
[13422.49s -> 13426.90s]  accidentally.
[13426.90s -> 13445.26s]  Three, two, click girl.
[13445.26s -> 13452.47s]  Ten percent of you guys click girl. I
[13452.47s -> 13456.20s]  see girl.
[13456.20s -> 13458.92s]  Uh, Mario's game gallery looks like it's
[13458.92s -> 13459.80s]  gonna be the one.
[13459.80s -> 13473.29s]  This might be an illegal stream. Yeah,
[13473.29s -> 13474.57s]  that's gonna be it.
[13474.57s -> 13482.98s]  Uh, Mario's game gallery. Okay, let's
[13482.98s -> 13490.95s]  go.
[13490.95s -> 13498.73s]  Ugh. Interplay. What? What do you mean
[13498.73s -> 13499.85s]  interplay?
[13499.85s -> 13502.49s]  Interplay. What? This is blowing my
[13502.49s -> 13503.13s]  mind.
[13503.13s -> 13506.49s]  Along with presage, proudly present.
[13506.49s -> 13514.36s]  This is not real. Is this real? Use a
[13514.36s -> 13516.20s]  game gallery.
[13516.20s -> 13523.96s]  Wow. A nice game of
[13524.04s -> 13528.14s]  checkers. He's talking. Hold on, get this
[13528.14s -> 13529.34s]  off the screen.
[13529.34s -> 13531.64s]  This motherfucker is doing false
[13531.64s -> 13544.06s]  sentences. He's never done that before.
[13544.06s -> 13550.15s]  Matt Gaiman. What does he yacht?
[13550.15s -> 13552.95s]  Mario versus checkers. That's a great
[13552.95s -> 13556.46s]  game.
[13556.46s -> 13559.70s]  Wow, this is awesome. This is worth
[13559.70s -> 13561.30s]  going to jail for.
[13561.30s -> 13567.98s]  Nice to see you again. Do you want
[13567.98s -> 13568.46s]  to play
[13568.46s -> 13571.58s]  as Yoshi or as Koopa? I would like to
[13571.58s -> 13586.74s]  play as
[13586.74s -> 13590.90s]  I'll play as Yoshi. Yoshi, Yoshi.
[13590.90s -> 13596.09s]  The chosen one. It's your turn.
[13596.09s -> 13603.19s]  This is weird perspective. I don't think
[13603.19s -> 13604.15s]  you can do that.
[13604.15s -> 13605.99s]  What? No, that's, the mouse is like
[13605.99s -> 13608.01s]  laggy.
[13608.01s -> 13618.39s]  That's what Yoshi's ass looks like?
[13618.39s -> 13620.95s]  Move. That's not a legal move.
[13620.95s -> 13623.35s]  This is not a legal stream, Mario. Why
[13623.35s -> 13627.02s]  can I not do anything?
[13627.02s -> 13637.26s]  I could. You next. Set him up for this
[13637.26s -> 13638.78s]  one.
[13639.67s -> 13643.50s]  Set him up for this one. Oh, fuck. Yoshi's
[13643.50s -> 13647.10s]  dead.
[13647.10s -> 13648.86s]  Oh, you're so good. You got Mario
[13648.86s -> 13651.96s]  confused.
[13651.96s -> 13660.66s]  Eat him alive. Kill him. Let me think.
[13660.66s -> 13662.34s]  Don't ever move the back row. What
[13662.34s -> 13663.30s]  happens if you get king? Do you get
[13663.30s -> 13668.89s]  two Yoshis?
[13668.89s -> 13673.58s]  Hmm, all right. Okay. Hmm,
[13673.58s -> 13683.21s]  no, no, no, no, no, no. It's Mario's
[13683.21s -> 13683.85s]  move.
[13683.85s -> 13691.86s]  I'm setting you up for this one.
[13691.86s -> 13693.78s]  All right, now check this out. He
[13693.78s -> 13695.46s]  thinks he's one.
[13695.46s -> 13698.66s]  His brain is not even remotely as
[13698.66s -> 13703.45s]  mutated as mine. I've already seen his
[13703.45s -> 13705.29s]  next five plays.
[13705.29s -> 13712.39s]  Mama mia. I'm a no.
[13712.39s -> 13716.94s]  Okie dokie. Your move. I'm just setting it
[13716.94s -> 13719.16s]  up.
[13719.16s -> 13723.98s]  Mama mia. How about this?
[13723.98s -> 13726.70s]  Okay. It's your turn. That's third moves
[13726.70s -> 13727.42s]  in.
[13727.42s -> 13732.07s]  Three moves in. You must make a jump
[13732.07s -> 13733.80s]  now.
[13733.80s -> 13740.68s]  I don't. What are you talking about? Oh, yeah.
[13740.68s -> 13743.16s]  We're gonna play by those rules? Oh,
[13743.16s -> 13749.05s]  playing by shitty rules, huh?
[13749.05s -> 13750.89s]  You have to jump? I hate those rules.
[13750.89s -> 13753.05s]  That's for low brain.
[13753.05s -> 13773.85s]  Low IQ brains. Go ahead. Go over there and get
[13773.85s -> 13777.34s]  kinged.
[13777.34s -> 13784.92s]  You can't win against Mario. Like
[13784.92s -> 13786.12s]  Mario's dumb?
[13786.12s -> 13791.30s]  Mario, Mario has like 180 IQ.
[13791.30s -> 13814.82s]  He's very smart. Yeah, come on.
[13814.82s -> 13817.56s]  What? What? Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[13818.52s -> 13821.24s]  Hey Mario, as you say in your patented
[13821.24s -> 13822.76s]  licensed video game.
[13822.76s -> 13829.08s]  Okie dokie. You got the jump you can make.
[13829.08s -> 13849.16s]  Do it. Mama mia. See you later.
[13849.16s -> 13851.58s]  I'm not gonna move this guy ever. Or
[13851.58s -> 13852.30s]  this guy.
[13852.30s -> 13873.85s]  Good luck. I'm a no. This...
[13873.85s -> 13876.89s]  That's... I don't like that. That's
[13876.89s -> 13877.93s]  terrifying.
[13877.93s -> 13881.80s]  He's gonna have to come out sooner or
[13881.80s -> 13887.27s]  later. I got it.
[13887.27s -> 13889.83s]  It's your turn.
[13889.83s -> 13893.43s]  Ooh, Mario, Mario, Mario. What have you
[13893.43s -> 13895.05s]  done?
[13895.05s -> 13910.01s]  What have you done? It's my turn now.
[13910.01s -> 13934.14s]  Let me think. Mama mia.
[13934.14s -> 13950.38s]  Congrats. It's my turn now. Level up.
[13950.38s -> 13951.98s]  Wait, we could have done... We could
[13951.98s -> 13953.82s]  have had it free.
[13953.82s -> 13955.98s]  I'm just like clicking random
[13955.98s -> 13959.00s]  squares. I'm gonna be real.
[13959.00s -> 13961.08s]  But it's all right. I got a
[13961.08s -> 13973.75s]  Giga Yoshi. Your move. It's my turn now.
[13973.75s -> 13990.79s]  What's wrong with that Yoshi? I just
[13990.79s -> 13992.38s]  don't... I like...
[13992.38s -> 13993.90s]  I was making stupid moves in the
[13993.90s -> 13996.15s]  beginning for like laugh out loud
[13996.15s -> 13997.43s]  comedy moments and then I couldn't
[13997.43s -> 13999.03s]  salvage it so I just figured oh who
[13999.03s -> 14006.38s]  cares.
[14006.38s -> 14016.18s]  I can still win. Okie dokie. Crown me.
[14016.18s -> 14019.40s]  The good old... Wait, I turned into Bowser.
[14019.40s -> 14020.68s]  I want to see what Bowser could do
[14020.68s -> 14027.54s]  too.
[14027.54s -> 14029.30s]  I fucked her. I fucked off too much
[14029.30s -> 14030.58s]  in the first 10 minutes.
[14030.58s -> 14043.66s]  You can't go there. I can't go
[14043.66s -> 14047.26s]  backwards. I'm gonna lie just to lose.
[14047.26s -> 14051.64s]  Let me do it again. Hold on. I want to do it. I don't want to
[14051.64s -> 14052.92s]  fuck around this time though. Let me show
[14052.92s -> 14063.83s]  you that I'm not stupid.
[14063.83s -> 14067.51s]  Great. I'm a liar. Go fish?
[14067.51s -> 14069.19s]  I'm gonna prove that I'm gonna play
[14069.19s -> 14070.79s]  Go fish. I'm not gonna... I'm gonna win
[14070.79s -> 14071.51s]  this round.
[14071.51s -> 14076.52s]  Just wait. I'm so happy to see you
[14076.52s -> 14077.00s]  again.
[14077.00s -> 14078.36s]  Shut up and steal the cards
[14078.36s -> 14079.72s]  motherfucker.
[14079.72s -> 14085.90s]  We'll go first. Do you have any
[14085.90s -> 14087.50s]  reap than a fishy?
[14087.50s -> 14089.02s]  I don't even know what that one is.
[14089.02s -> 14091.90s]  Hey. Oh, right. I would like to have your
[14091.90s -> 14101.46s]  Bowser's. Mario, go fish.
[14101.46s -> 14104.26s]  It's supposed to be like a
[14104.26s -> 14111.80s]  five-year-old. Wait, what are the rules
[14111.80s -> 14113.24s]  for Go fish?
[14113.24s -> 14115.08s]  In Go fish, you and Mario will try to
[14115.08s -> 14115.96s]  have...
[14115.96s -> 14117.88s]  try to make as many books of four
[14117.88s -> 14119.00s]  of a kind as you can.
[14119.00s -> 14120.28s]  You are dealt... I don't remember how
[14120.28s -> 14121.72s]  to play Go fish. I haven't played it
[14121.72s -> 14123.32s]  in like 30 years.
[14123.32s -> 14125.08s]  You are dealt seven cards which
[14125.08s -> 14126.04s]  appear along the bottom of the
[14126.04s -> 14126.52s]  screen.
[14126.52s -> 14128.52s]  To ask Mario for a particular card, look
[14128.52s -> 14129.48s]  on a card.
[14129.48s -> 14134.09s]  Uh, I haven't played in a long time.
[14134.09s -> 14138.94s]  Go fish.
[14138.94s -> 14145.90s]  What? Please give me your reap than a
[14145.90s -> 14146.54s]  fishy.
[14146.54s -> 14147.74s]  I don't have any. I don't have any.
[14147.74s -> 14149.66s]  Mario, go fish.
[14149.66s -> 14154.46s]  Ah, I guess I'm gonna go fishing.
[14154.46s -> 14156.86s]  It's your turn.
[14156.86s -> 14159.34s]  All right. Do you have any Koopas?
[14159.34s -> 14161.10s]  Go fish. You have to...
[14161.10s -> 14162.78s]  What do you have for cards? Give me
[14162.78s -> 14164.46s]  a break.
[14164.54s -> 14168.49s]  A fishing for Luigi's.
[14168.49s -> 14171.61s]  Don't have any. Mario, go fish.
[14171.61s -> 14173.21s]  Looks like it's time to go fishing
[14173.21s -> 14175.91s]  again.
[14175.91s -> 14178.95s]  Okay. All right, you gotta have some
[14178.95s -> 14180.15s]  ba-bombs.
[14180.15s -> 14183.59s]  Yes, I'ma have two cards. Mario is
[14183.59s -> 14184.15s]  getting
[14184.15s -> 14187.83s]  destroyed. It's your turn. Hey Mario,
[14187.83s -> 14190.47s]  uh, you got any blue fucked up
[14190.47s -> 14190.95s]  Yoshi's?
[14190.95s -> 14200.17s]  Go fish. I'd like to have your
[14200.17s -> 14203.19s]  Koopas.
[14203.27s -> 14204.95s]  Sorry, tied up. Please give me your
[14204.95s -> 14206.95s]  Luigi's. Don't have any. He really
[14206.95s -> 14209.03s]  wants Luigi's. Mario, go fish.
[14209.03s -> 14212.71s]  Come here fishy fishy. Here fishy fishy.
[14212.71s -> 14215.67s]  It's your turn. Yeah, uh, I'd like
[14215.67s -> 14220.06s]  your rip van winkles please. Please, I'ma have two cards.
[14220.06s -> 14223.34s]  Thank you. Okay. All right,
[14223.34s -> 14226.30s]  so let's talk about how many toads
[14226.30s -> 14227.85s]  you got.
[14227.85s -> 14234.74s]  Go fish. Oh, I got two toads. You got what you wanted.
[14234.82s -> 14237.46s]  It's your turn. Mario, are you looking at my
[14237.46s -> 14241.19s]  cards?
[14241.19s -> 14244.38s]  So he's been cheating the whole time.
[14244.38s -> 14245.66s]  He's cheating in checkers too. He had
[14245.66s -> 14247.08s]  extra pieces.
[14247.08s -> 14250.44s]  Fine. Okay, that's fucked up. Go fish.
[14250.44s -> 14261.26s]  I'ma fishing for piranha plant.
[14261.26s -> 14263.90s]  The house always wins. I'ma looking for
[14263.90s -> 14265.82s]  Luigi's. He probably only needs one.
[14265.82s -> 14268.70s]  Give me your Luigi's.
[14268.70s -> 14272.44s]  I'ma guess I'ma go fishing. Mario has
[14272.44s -> 14273.56s]  this like fucked up
[14273.56s -> 14276.38s]  cheating casino. I think he has a game
[14276.38s -> 14278.06s]  promoted for two years.
[14278.06s -> 14280.55s]  His finance with illegal money. All
[14280.55s -> 14282.71s]  right, uh, he wants Yoshi's doesn't he?
[14282.71s -> 14285.59s]  Give me the Yoshi's. Yes, I have one card.
[14285.59s -> 14291.14s]  It's your turn. Okay, so
[14291.14s -> 14297.27s]  what about Goombas? Yes, sir. Yes, you
[14297.27s -> 14300.26s]  do. I have one card.
[14300.26s -> 14305.10s]  Hmm. Okay. I don't think I can do
[14305.10s -> 14306.62s]  anything else. Bob-ombs maybe? Maybe
[14306.62s -> 14308.20s]  he got another one.
[14308.20s -> 14317.10s]  Or a boo? Maybe he has a couple now.
[14317.10s -> 14321.10s]  Ooh. I'd like to have your Goombas.
[14321.10s -> 14324.79s]  Mario, go fish. Looks like it's time to go
[14324.79s -> 14325.91s]  fishing again.
[14325.91s -> 14328.39s]  All right, what'd you get? Mario gets to
[14328.39s -> 14329.35s]  go again.
[14329.35s -> 14332.07s]  Oh, fuck you, Mario. Do you have any
[14332.07s -> 14332.95s]  Luigi's?
[14332.95s -> 14335.83s]  No. Mario, go fish. No, he's gonna
[14335.83s -> 14337.59s]  he's gonna complete his deck.
[14337.59s -> 14340.23s]  Here, fishy. That's one book for Mario.
[14340.23s -> 14344.26s]  Oh, come on. What book was it? I don't know what to ask for.
[14344.26s -> 14347.54s]  Oh, you asshole. I'ma fishing for
[14347.54s -> 14352.26s]  piranha plant. Mario, go fish.
[14352.26s -> 14355.78s]  Come here, fishy fishy. Here, fishy fishy.
[14355.78s -> 14361.66s]  Okay. Can I play now? Do I get to go?
[14361.66s -> 14363.18s]  Do you? Yeah, I think you may have gotten
[14363.18s -> 14367.32s]  another sleepy. I could complete a book
[14367.32s -> 14369.32s]  here.
[14369.32s -> 14374.47s]  Go fish. I can get it though. No, he's
[14374.47s -> 14375.67s]  gonna ask for it.
[14375.67s -> 14381.18s]  Oh, rexes. I'm looking for
[14381.18s -> 14386.39s]  Bowser's. No, I don't want to go fish. Looks like it's time to go fishing again.
[14386.39s -> 14387.99s]  He's gonna complete the deck.
[14387.99s -> 14392.70s]  It's your turn. Come on, you get me. You had to have just got one.
[14392.70s -> 14398.46s]  Oh, brother. You got three of them, don't you?
[14401.21s -> 14410.52s]  So, one book for you. K. Check this out.
[14410.52s -> 14414.89s]  Yes, sir.
[14414.89s -> 14420.57s]  That's another book for you. It's your turn.
[14420.57s -> 14423.53s]  Hey Mario, you got any Yoshi's in there? Go fish.
[14423.53s -> 14428.65s]  Oh, I'll be getting one right now.
[14428.65s -> 14432.33s]  Oh, I would just start
[14432.33s -> 14436.73s]  punching the table. I'd like to have your
[14436.73s -> 14447.94s]  Piran. I guess I'm go fishing. Oh, you're so good.
[14447.94s -> 14451.78s]  Thank you. It's your turn. Oh, and guess what? Hey, the Yoshi you just took
[14451.78s -> 14456.76s]  out of the deck. I'll take it. Yes, sir. I have one card. Oh, would you like it?
[14456.76s -> 14459.80s]  I love it. I love seeing it. That's another book for you.
[14459.80s -> 14467.90s]  Mario think you fantastic. Okay.
[14467.90s -> 14473.62s]  Go fish. Mario, I don't think you beat me.
[14473.62s -> 14477.80s]  I'm fishing for... I get a Bowser's from here. I get
[14477.80s -> 14482.52s]  five books. Mario, go fish. Looks like it's time to go fishing again.
[14482.52s -> 14485.08s]  Mario's going easy on you because you're playing as a five-year-old. I really
[14485.08s -> 14489.08s]  enjoy playing with you. Oh, fuck. He really is. It's your turn.
[14489.08s -> 14492.20s]  He's complimenting me after every single
[14492.20s -> 14496.23s]  card he takes. He's saying really nice things about me. He's
[14496.23s -> 14506.70s]  letting me take his cards. Shit. Oh, no. I got three cards.
[14506.70s -> 14510.22s]  And I'm so excited about it. It's another book for you. Somebody would be mad about
[14510.22s -> 14515.18s]  this, but he's like, oh, no. We know. I love you. You're the
[14515.18s -> 14521.38s]  best. You're so smart at this game. Oh,
[14521.38s -> 14529.72s]  good. Yes, sir. I have one card. I'm cleaning
[14529.72s -> 14534.47s]  him out. I really enjoy playing with you.
[14534.47s -> 14543.96s]  It's your turn. Hey, you got any booze? Go fish.
[14543.96s -> 14547.32s]  Please give me your... He's not even trying anymore.
[14547.32s -> 14550.84s]  Mario, go fish. He's playing with an actual four-year-old.
[14550.84s -> 14554.60s]  I'm go fishing. You can't beat a four-year-old in any game.
[14554.60s -> 14557.64s]  I get another turn. You're a bad person if you do. I'm
[14557.64s -> 14562.28s]  looking for Bowser's. Anybody under the age of eight,
[14562.36s -> 14568.92s]  if you do any activity, you have to let them win.
[14568.92s -> 14573.61s]  Otherwise, you are a bad person. If you play,
[14573.61s -> 14577.29s]  let's say, for instance, like Connect Four
[14577.29s -> 14581.45s]  with a five-year-old, and you win, and you're like, yeah, I won.
[14581.45s -> 14585.37s]  Hold on, Mario.
[14585.37s -> 14596.52s]  Relax. Give me some time. Go fish. Somebody's three.
[14596.60s -> 14600.71s]  I'm looking for... Oh, shit. Big booze.
[14600.71s -> 14604.31s]  But now he's here. Do you have any rexes?
[14604.31s -> 14607.11s]  Mario, go fish. Mario, I got it.
[14607.11s -> 14612.65s]  I guess I'm go fishing. Mario, thank you.
[14612.65s -> 14617.58s]  Oh, okay. Thank you. Give me a coach.
[14617.58s -> 14623.90s]  Go fish. Okay. That's my favorite card. I love Mario.
[14623.90s -> 14627.18s]  I'm fishing for big booze. He just got them.
[14627.18s -> 14631.10s]  Mario, go fish. Come here, fishy, fishy.
[14631.10s -> 14634.38s]  Here, fishy, fishy. Oh, you're so good.
[14634.38s -> 14637.42s]  It's your turn. I really am getting played
[14637.42s -> 14642.38s]  as a four-year-old. I have one card.
[14642.38s -> 14646.22s]  I'm beating him by so much. It has to be intentional.
[14646.22s -> 14654.33s]  I really enjoy playing with you. It's your turn.
[14654.33s -> 14660.25s]  Go fish. That's so funny.
[14660.33s -> 14663.69s]  Where are you getting these cards? I'd like to have your rexes.
[14663.69s -> 14667.05s]  Mario, I haven't... I haven't had rexes in like
[14667.05s -> 14671.53s]  seven turns. Change the age in the options menu?
[14671.53s -> 14677.45s]  Fantastic. Shut up. That's not real.
[14677.45s -> 14680.65s]  I thought that just said change age for a second. I was like, there's no
[14680.65s -> 14688.23s]  fucking way. Change age.
[14688.23s -> 14698.01s]  Go fish. Please give me your booze.
[14698.01s -> 14703.48s]  Mario, go fish. Looks like it's time to go fishing again.
[14703.48s -> 14710.90s]  Oh, you're so good. It's your turn. Look at that. I thought you said
[14710.90s -> 14716.42s]  pretending gaze. Go fish. I should get a Goomba here. How many cards are in the deck?
[14716.42s -> 14725.67s]  I'd like to have your Mario's. Fine. Please give me your big booze.
[14725.75s -> 14734.28s]  Mario, go fish. Come here fishy fishy. Here fishy fishy. I really enjoy playing with you.
[14734.28s -> 14743.86s]  Okay. Um, this is actually the kind of scenario where like he's being held
[14743.86s -> 14747.70s]  hostage and he is trying to communicate with me somehow.
[14747.70s -> 14752.36s]  This is like the the type of shit. Look at him.
[14752.36s -> 14756.12s]  I'm really enjoying playing with you. Oh, you're so smart.
[14756.12s -> 14760.54s]  Okay, it's your turn. I really enjoy playing with you.
[14760.54s -> 14765.02s]  You're so good at this. Hey, I'm having a great time here
[14765.02s -> 14773.96s]  at the table. What's it take so long? Go fish.
[14773.96s -> 14781.96s]  Fishing for rexes. I'm a gaze. I'm a go fishing.
[14781.96s -> 14786.33s]  That stare too. They're like, I guess. That's another Mario.
[14786.33s -> 14794.65s]  Mario think you fantastic. Okay. He starts like winching his face and
[14794.65s -> 14800.25s]  like Mario think you fantastic. Wink over here under the table.
[14800.25s -> 14812.68s]  There's a gun pointing at me. Yes, I have two cards. That's another book for you.
[14812.68s -> 14821.37s]  Oh, you're so good. It's your turn. He's asking for Bowser's the whole time.
[14821.37s -> 14825.45s]  I got three cards. I know it's Bowser. I'm just beating him so bad.
[14825.45s -> 14832.39s]  That's another book for you. I really enjoy playing with you.
[14832.47s -> 14838.39s]  It's your turn. Go fish. Last card is going to be the goomba.
[14838.39s -> 14842.63s]  No, he's going to get the booze. I'm looking for big boos.
[14842.63s -> 14849.27s]  It's another book for Mario. No mercy.
[14849.27s -> 14853.43s]  Your rexes. He's going to get another book.
[14853.43s -> 14859.75s]  Sorry. Here fishy fishy. Here fish. It's another book for Mario.
[14859.75s -> 14863.74s]  I guess I need another card. What if he just keeps completing?
[14863.74s -> 14868.46s]  Fishing again. Is this where I get sharked? Do you have any goombas?
[14868.46s -> 14873.50s]  Oh no. Did I get sharked? No, I win. That's another book for Mario.
[14873.50s -> 14889.61s]  Hey, you won. Help me. I did it. Told you guys I was going to win.
[14889.61s -> 14898.22s]  Hey, how about another game with me? No, bye Mario.
[14898.22s -> 14904.20s]  What? And here's the thing. I don't know how to play
[14904.20s -> 14907.24s]  any of the rest of these games. I don't. I only know about
[14907.24s -> 14910.66s]  dominoes. You set them up for like six hours and you knock them down.
[14910.66s -> 14915.66s]  They do a cool thing. They spin around around your sofa and like over your
[14915.66s -> 14918.39s]  fridge and stuff. I don't know how to play this.
[14918.39s -> 14922.04s]  Like the actual game dominoes. I don't know.
[14922.04s -> 14926.36s]  Backgammon is, again, I have no idea.
[14926.36s -> 14929.88s]  And yacht is an expensive boat for rich people.
[14929.88s -> 14933.22s]  I don't know what that means. I'll try it. You guys have to help me here.
[14933.22s -> 14942.39s]  That is what this is. Okay. Mario, you are fucking enormous.
[14942.39s -> 14956.65s]  Why are you like 80 feet tall? He's huge. I'm gonna go first.
[14956.65s -> 14959.61s]  I don't know what this means. Oh, it's just, is it just like poker?
[14959.61s -> 14966.50s]  Like dice poker? You got a full house. That's going on the full house
[14966.50s -> 14974.10s]  line. Okey dokey. Your move. This is yacht. I've never played one game of
[14974.10s -> 14978.14s]  Yahtzee. All I know is I see people play
[14978.14s -> 14980.94s]  Yahtzee in TV and they don't just shake the thing around. They go
[14980.94s -> 14984.41s]  Yahtzee and they high five. I don't know what they're doing.
[14984.41s -> 14991.86s]  All right, so we need, uh, let's see. One, two, we could get a full house.
[14991.86s -> 15002.18s]  Choices, sixes. Hold on a minute here. What is going on?
[15002.18s -> 15007.96s]  Just re-roll, yeah, just re-roll the one, right? Because I could get a full
[15007.96s -> 15011.21s]  house. Does that mean I'm holding them? Does
[15011.21s -> 15022.86s]  that mean I'm rolling them? Click to hold. Okay, so roll.
[15022.86s -> 15049.30s]  Oh, I can try it again. Your turn. Hello. Oh wait, fours, choice?
[15049.30s -> 15058.52s]  Way to go. What is choice? It's my turn now.
[15058.52s -> 15062.36s]  Oh, you have to pick something, okay. I got it. The three threes,
[15062.36s -> 15066.52s]  come on. Yeah, Mario's got extra dice up his
[15066.52s -> 15079.27s]  uh, clubs. I'm gonna roll these ones again. He's gonna get five, okay.
[15079.27s -> 15083.51s]  Mario's gonna put these on the deuces line.
[15083.51s -> 15089.38s]  That's not that much. Your roll. The stream always devolves into some
[15089.38s -> 15094.31s]  form of gambling. We're not betting any money here. I'm playing
[15094.55s -> 15098.39s]  a children's dice game with a made-up kid's cartoon character. That was just
[15098.39s -> 15104.68s]  gambling. Mario's not real. All right, so we're
[15104.68s -> 15108.65s]  gonna go with the, I'm gonna try to get five of a kind.
[15108.65s -> 15112.09s]  Wait, can I do a straight? One, two, three, four. Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15112.09s -> 15117.13s]  I could get a big straight, small straight. Let's go with one,
[15117.13s -> 15124.60s]  three, four. I just need two, right? I'm gonna roll for the two, because
[15124.60s -> 15126.68s]  that would be a small straight. What would, a big straight is the whole
[15126.68s -> 15136.20s]  thing. Yeah, fuck it, dude. No, let's go,
[15136.20s -> 15147.53s]  let's go for two. How is that a small straight? That's
[15147.53s -> 15156.39s]  one, oh shit. I just need five. One, two, three,
[15156.39s -> 15159.75s]  four, five. I still have the small straight.
[15159.75s -> 15180.87s]  It's all right, it's all right. This game's fun. I've never played it
[15180.87s -> 15184.07s]  before. This is cool. I like this. I'm gonna play this tomorrow.
[15184.07s -> 15193.75s]  I'm gonna roll these ones again. What do you mean, no, it's not.
[15193.83s -> 15198.71s]  Uh-oh. I'm gonna roll these ones again. So if you get a full house,
[15198.71s -> 15203.62s]  you can't do it again. Is the goal to get every single thing,
[15203.62s -> 15208.50s]  or just points? That's going on the aces line.
[15208.50s -> 15215.66s]  It's your turn. Oh, that's gonna go on the aces.
[15215.66s -> 15222.44s]  Yeah, at most points. I got, all right, bingo, we got two, we got one,
[15222.44s -> 15226.30s]  two, we got twos. Let's just try to get some twos here.
[15226.30s -> 15230.44s]  We could do one, two, three, four, five, six.
[15230.44s -> 15248.52s]  No, there it is. What do you mean, six is fives,
[15248.52s -> 15257.24s]  three is deuces? Sixes. It's only one six.
[15257.24s -> 15264.28s]  I don't... Oh no! It's my turn now. You just get six, you get six points.
[15264.28s -> 15269.00s]  Okay. Let's see. Well, I'm kicking the shit out of
[15269.00s -> 15281.78s]  him, so I'm all right. Fives. Don't get five. Don't get
[15281.78s -> 15287.11s]  any more. Yes. Mario's gonna put these on the
[15287.11s -> 15291.59s]  fives line. Stop hurting Mario. It's your turn.
[15291.59s -> 15300.18s]  I didn't do anything. That's pretty good. That's a pretty good chance for a full
[15300.18s -> 15304.70s]  house. I don't have it yet, so come on, give me
[15304.70s -> 15327.98s]  a five or a six. It's not a five or a six.
[15327.98s -> 15331.94s]  I wanted to get the five guy. The five...
[15331.94s -> 15341.26s]  Where is it? Aces. You want me to do aces?
[15341.26s -> 15345.58s]  No, no, no. Ones don't matter. Yes, yes, do it.
[15345.58s -> 15350.86s]  Minimize loss. Minimize loss. Aces max at six points.
[15350.86s -> 15356.70s]  Save fives. I don't... I don't... I don't... That's the first time I've ever
[15356.70s -> 15360.63s]  played this game. Just tell... Just help me.
[15360.63s -> 15371.19s]  Okay. It's such a simple card. I've never seen it before.
[15371.19s -> 15380.52s]  I know you make like cards like... Stop yelling at me.
[15380.52s -> 15384.04s]  Save bigger scoring categories. Yeah, that's... Yeah, that's true. I'm gonna win.
[15384.04s -> 15388.84s]  Don't worry. I got it. That's going on the little straight line.
[15388.84s -> 15396.09s]  Small straight. Okay, this is my chance. How do you get a... What's a yacht?
[15396.09s -> 15404.22s]  Yahtzee. Yahtzee. I get it now. All right. Here we go.
[15404.22s -> 15415.42s]  So the... It's five of a kind. Do I go for the full house here? That's not
[15415.42s -> 15420.15s]  going to be enough points though. That won't be a lot of points.
[15420.15s -> 15426.90s]  Does it... It depends on... Because it matters the denomination.
[15426.90s -> 15434.66s]  Yeah, that would be a waste. All right, there we go. Well, there's the full
[15434.66s -> 15438.81s]  house right there. God damn it. Should I just save the threes and
[15438.81s -> 15442.81s]  try to go for another... More threes? Or should I just keep this as a full
[15442.81s -> 15451.06s]  house? Because... Because what... That's not...
[15451.06s -> 15452.58s]  All right. I'm gonna take the full house.
[15452.58s -> 15459.94s]  That's a good move. It's my turn now.
[15459.94s -> 15463.06s]  That's a poor man's full house. Well, it might be the only one I get.
[15463.06s -> 15470.26s]  Is he going for sixes? Oh no, this is bad.
[15470.26s -> 15478.04s]  I'm gonna roll these ones again. Do not get a full six, Yahtzee.
[15478.04s -> 15484.82s]  Let's see. Mario's gonna put this on the sixes line.
[15484.82s -> 15488.34s]  How much money points? 18 points for three sixes.
[15488.34s -> 15501.98s]  Oh my god, okay. Okay, we can do fives. There's also one, two, three. One, two,
[15501.98s -> 15513.34s]  three, four, five. What's a big straight?
[15513.34s -> 15525.53s]  All of them? One, two, three, four, five.
[15525.61s -> 15556.52s]  Oh boy, come on. Give me a four. I could have had it.
[15556.52s -> 15565.75s]  It's not that hard. It's not a bad chance. He's going for the ones.
[15565.75s -> 15569.64s]  What? Oh no. I'm gonna roll these ones again.
[15569.64s -> 15575.35s]  He's going for a four or five of a kind. He really wants those big sixes.
[15575.35s -> 15578.47s]  Oh my god, game sucks. That's going on the
[15578.47s -> 15581.99s]  Yahtzee. How many points is that? 50.
[15582.07s -> 15586.50s]  Okie dokie. Your move. Oh, I'm never gonna win now.
[15586.50s -> 15588.98s]  That's like the, that's the best thing you could possibly get in the whole
[15588.98s -> 15601.99s]  game. There's no way I'm gonna win. It was all sixes. I just feel defeated
[15601.99s -> 15609.40s]  now. Lost to Mario. I just beat him though,
[15609.40s -> 15612.28s]  whatever. Um, I'm, I guess I could go for,
[15612.28s -> 15617.19s]  doesn't matter. It's just like being at the blackjack table and a guy
[15617.19s -> 15619.35s]  next to you does like a five hundred dollar hand and he gets
[15619.35s -> 15622.79s]  blackjack and you've lost the like the last five hands in a row and you
[15622.79s -> 15627.35s]  lose again and he's like yeah oh my god blackjack and you're sitting there like
[15627.35s -> 15637.22s]  fun games we're having here fun having a fun time
[15637.22s -> 15643.74s]  here we go this could put me back in two three
[15643.74s -> 15656.52s]  four five six give me a two well do i try to beat him in his own game and
[15656.52s -> 15658.44s]  do sixes and fucking throw the dice in the
[15658.44s -> 15676.73s]  air i sometimes gotta do a hail mary play
[15676.73s -> 15685.19s]  it's your turn ah fours it's only one in six chance and i've done it
[15685.19s -> 15703.51s]  like three times i can't win okay oh i got it oh sixes
[15703.51s -> 15709.16s]  one in six is unlikely no i don't say that
[15709.16s -> 15714.78s]  he's gonna do another what is he looking for here just straight
[15714.78s -> 15718.39s]  well he didn't get it mario's gonna put this on the
[15718.39s -> 15733.10s]  choice line okay i'm sorry i already did the full

[15812.82s -> 15819.32s]  it's your turn uh i don't i don't think there's a reason for me to
[15819.32s -> 15826.89s]  play right now unless i get a big straight and sixes
[15826.89s -> 15833.27s]  one two three four five so just hold up hold the sixes and just

[16606.31s -> 16609.91s]  possible if i get your turn a big yahtzee

[16619.69s -> 16628.14s]  threes i don't want to i'm not taking that full house

[17284.57s -> 17290.74s]  you lose mario you got too greedy bad play mario
[17290.82s -> 17298.97s]  bad play any yahtzee is 50 bad play though with ones
[17298.97s -> 17302.01s]  i wouldn't have done that i what an idiot you know what i mean i've been
[17302.01s -> 17313.18s]  playing this a lot now we go for the threes mario you
[17313.18s -> 17325.00s]  may as well fucking just give up mario i mean like you may as well
[17325.00s -> 17337.59s]  just give up uh oh uh oh is right i'm gonna
[17337.59s -> 17347.64s]  roll these ones again uh oh this is bad
[17347.64s -> 17355.59s]  he's not gonna get it let's see mario's gonna put this
[17355.59s -> 17360.47s]  that's the second time he's done that your roll that's the second time he's
[17360.47s -> 17370.07s]  done that that's uh that gets hairy here all right
[17370.07s -> 17382.06s]  we can do twos let's try or we could yeah
[17382.06s -> 17393.13s]  come on give me a few more make this good it's all right
[17393.13s -> 17398.07s]  better than nothing better than nothing that's a great move
[17398.07s -> 17406.87s]  it's my turn now still ahead that four of a kind is gonna kill him
[17406.87s -> 17417.24s]  oh i'm gonna roll these ones again come on not good it's all right
[17417.24s -> 17427.64s]  three is not terrible i could get four oh no he already fell he already did a
[17427.64s -> 17431.16s]  full house that's a pretty average score not bad
[17431.16s -> 17441.93s]  speaking of fall houses i wonder if this is worth getting or if i should
[17441.93s -> 17447.13s]  go for fives but i'm an idiot never mind i thought
[17447.13s -> 17456.52s]  that was a three come on i can't just get three in
[17456.52s -> 17474.46s]  every category another one yes oh thank you for playing my game
[17474.46s -> 17488.39s]  that's a that's a yahtzee it's my turn now
[17488.39s -> 17491.59s]  we're almost at the level of uh unachievable to win
[17491.59s -> 17494.31s]  unless he gets one if he gets a yahtzee the game still goes it's
[17494.31s -> 17499.70s]  still good it's still very possible my top three
[17499.70s -> 17506.46s]  scores are the best you can get mario's gonna put these on the
[17506.54s -> 17511.24s]  uses line didn't you say you were done with this shit

[17524.31s -> 17533.93s]  take the 23 points i think i'm just gonna take the 23 points
[17533.93s -> 17541.46s]  and just and roll the two you know i'm saying
[17541.46s -> 17545.11s]  you gotta get it i gotta get a good choice at some point or roll the
[17545.11s -> 17558.76s]  sixes yeah i could get more sixes guys oh
[17558.76s -> 17575.19s]  boy it's my turn now let's see re-roll the four it i i'm i'm i got
[17575.19s -> 17577.91s]  the high from the casino it doesn't matter i win

[17611.85s -> 17619.66s]  reach it's out of reach now and that's a
[17619.66s -> 17623.26s]  full fucking house look at that full house you ain't gonna
[17623.26s -> 17632.10s]  get much better than that that's a great move it's my turn now
[17632.10s -> 17634.58s]  in fact yeah you can't get better than that that's the best full house in
[17634.58s -> 17644.73s]  the game oh your big straight is gonna really
[17644.73s -> 17669.94s]  help you here i think he's just depressed
[17669.94s -> 17672.98s]  i think he gave up i think he's just realizing that it's impossible for him
[17672.98s -> 17679.72s]  to win he took the loss all right well let's
[17679.72s -> 17686.97s]  go for um it's i mean the game's over one iq mario
[17686.97s -> 17692.06s]  look at that look at him if that look at that face he is so
[17692.06s -> 17697.59s]  fucking angry right now look at his lips just fucking pushed
[17697.59s -> 17702.73s]  crushed together just look at his hands his body language
[17702.73s -> 17711.56s]  clasping his hands together no no mario fine
[17711.56s -> 17715.00s]  i'm gonna go for sixes just because like fuck it why not
[17715.00s -> 17749.80s]  not anymore whoa should i just do it uh-huh yeah

[17761.00s -> 17765.00s]  line it's not possible for him to win it's your turn
[17765.00s -> 17770.02s]  i mean i guess if i didn't get anything
[17770.02s -> 17773.46s]  it might be possible sort of something really bad would have to
[17773.46s -> 17782.36s]  happen uh we could go for four of kind
[17782.36s -> 17796.41s]  but that's not gonna happen we need to go for fours oh god damn it
[17796.41s -> 17811.67s]  now i gotta go for fives i could just take the four
[17811.67s -> 17824.26s]  i could take the four okay it's my turn now no yahtzee and i
[17824.26s -> 17835.27s]  went he ain't gonna get it i would have beat
[17835.27s -> 17838.34s]  him with the five oh because the points right
[17838.34s -> 17841.62s]  it's all right for him to get a yahtzee right now would be
[17841.62s -> 17845.30s]  like you know that's literally getting struck by lightning
[17846.90s -> 17849.85s]  that's getting struck by lightning while you scratching a lottery ticket
[17849.85s -> 17854.01s]  and you win he's not gonna get it fives or four of
[17854.01s -> 17871.91s]  a kind um i could go for the uh i went see you

[18366.76s -> 18376.63s]  like a mario go first good luck i would be surprised if even

[23258.76s -> 23260.36s]  know you know but sometimes you have to commit
[23260.36s -> 23263.32s]  even though you know it's like that's this is a stupid reference and no one's
[23263.32s -> 23270.14s]  gonna like this it was a nightmare tear joke oh no
[23270.14s -> 23274.07s]  oh no i better wake up i gotta wake up no

[23286.22s -> 23296.12s]  on what's today saturday i'll see you guys on tuesday
[23296.12s -> 23301.80s]  tuesday afternoon reno i'm gonna read the bits we'll hang out for a little
[23301.80s -> 23304.46s]  bit i'm just for the people that want to
[23304.46s -> 23315.56s]  take off but this was a little trial test run to see how fun something like
[23315.56s -> 23318.97s]  this would be and there's a lot to still play
[23318.97s -> 23322.49s]  i might change up the format a little bit i might pick a screen
[23322.49s -> 23328.90s]  and then we have to pick uh like two or three games from that
[23328.90s -> 23334.74s]  screen i think that's better that way the scroll can still be there but it
[23334.74s -> 23339.72s]  will pop up i mean maybe it'll just after we do three we'll just scroll
[23339.72s -> 23343.56s]  instead of rather than just because i feel like maybe
[23343.56s -> 23346.68s]  if you want it to scroll you may potentially throw in a vote away to pick
[23346.68s -> 23353.19s]  a game that was already on the screen so maybe per eat per screen we would do
[23353.19s -> 23359.16s]  three and then i would just scroll down
[23359.16s -> 23361.48s]  but you'll see this again we'll probably do it next week we'll do
[23361.48s -> 23364.12s]  some other stuff next week too thank you for joining me
[23364.12s -> 23367.78s]  i'll see you on tuesday take care much love to you if you're leaving

[23385.16s -> 23389.24s]  lot of money how about three and then an option to
[23389.24s -> 23397.02s]  scroll that's a good idea too we'll play around with the idea uh
[23397.02s -> 23401.82s]  mr comcast hey germa john comcast here so sue me for being thorough

[23747.83s -> 23751.54s]  interested in final fantasy 7 or the remake

[23755.62s -> 23760.49s]  top five top 10 really it's not that i don't think the game is any good
[23760.49s -> 23762.49s]  it's just not kind of anything i really
[23762.49s -> 23767.22s]  cared that much about it's a great game but
[23767.22s -> 23770.98s]  uh final fantasy wise i played the old ones
[23771.30s -> 23776.76s]  fantasy one two three uh but for the most part i was a
[23776.76s -> 23781.16s]  i'm one of those chrono boomers i'm one of those like chrono
[23781.16s -> 23786.14s]  series and hipsters that loves that series more than final fantasy
[23786.14s -> 23789.42s]  and every time somebody mentions final fantasy x
[23789.42s -> 23793.19s]  final fantasy whatever it doesn't matter i'm always the one that goes

[23833.91s -> 23837.35s]  just because they've re-released it 12 times doesn't mean everybody bought
[23837.35s -> 23851.75s]  it but uh yeah i final fantasy is a
[23851.75s -> 23854.55s]  cool series i like the original ones i'm not a big fan of the

[24625.70s -> 24627.94s]  this discussion already yeah but you know
[24627.94s -> 24631.51s]  something a lot of people on this channel
[24631.51s -> 24634.63s]  there are thousands of people and maybe you didn't hear it and maybe you
[24634.63s -> 24638.23s]  don't know you know it's it's not easy to keep up with everything
[24638.23s -> 24652.78s]  it's not that many ego maniac what what well that's not true do my eyes

[24684.02s -> 24690.63s]  think so i don't want to keep putting the
[24690.63s -> 24694.47s]  carrot in front of everybody maybe next time maybe next time no no
[24694.47s -> 24702.44s]  i invested in germa and i'm down 3k did you invest in key wall like i told
[24702.44s -> 24704.12s]  you to remember i told you what did i say
[24704.12s -> 24707.64s]  specifically put all your money into key well i said that
[24707.64s -> 24712.28s]  that key will key well stock is up like fucking 500 i told you
[24712.28s -> 24726.86s]  you should have listened to me did you play the game yes i did
[24726.86s -> 24730.30s]  i did play the first ace attorney for maybe
[24730.30s -> 24736.95s]  15 20 minutes i'll tell you i'll tell you something that
[24736.95s -> 24741.35s]  i really don't i didn't i didn't like i don't know if you can turn this
[24741.35s -> 24747.56s]  off but the screen flash it seems like every
[24747.56s -> 24754.44s]  10 seconds there's a like a white flash on the screen
[24754.44s -> 24761.22s]  and i it was kind of giving me a headache i'm just i'm just being
[24761.22s -> 24768.26s]  completely honest during like the dialogue it's just
[24768.26s -> 24776.50s]  like white flash white flash white flash white flash
[24776.50s -> 24781.74s]  it's dramatic and it's kind of just getting flashed in the face
[24781.74s -> 24784.70s]  that's why no that's not why i just there's somebody asked if i
[24784.70s -> 24789.90s]  tried it and i did that's not why i wasn't going to
[24789.90s -> 24793.21s]  play it just was it seemed like it seemed like it was going to take a
[24793.21s -> 24795.93s]  long time to and it would go and almost solely
[24795.93s -> 24800.41s]  relied on the dialogue which i would have to read
[24800.41s -> 24804.25s]  and instead of something like sorcery which reading was
[24804.25s -> 24806.65s]  i could kind of put my own spin on it and we could choose different things to
[24806.65s -> 24818.92s]  do it it's more of just a kind of a visual novel
[24818.92s -> 24822.76s]  i would much rather play that comfy like under my blankets
[24822.76s -> 24826.92s]  with a t and just sit there silent and like investigate then
[24826.92s -> 24830.20s]  stream something like that is what i kind of came to the
[24830.20s -> 24847.53s]  determination of but yeah i i don't want to
[24847.53s -> 24853.21s]  you know obviously that i don't think it's a bad series that's no way
[24853.21s -> 24856.65s]  no way just don't think i want to stream that game
[24856.65s -> 24861.82s]  or the series i'm sorry i'm sorry do i play games without streaming them
[24861.82s -> 24866.52s]  yeah i actually just played forager for a little while
[24866.52s -> 24870.94s]  for like four or five hours over the last like couple weeks
[24870.94s -> 24874.94s]  it's fun i don't really you know talk that much about the random stuff
[24874.94s -> 24885.88s]  i play off stream he's cheating on us how do you
[24885.88s -> 24891.50s]  find the time to do it i uh it really depends like
[24891.50s -> 24895.42s]  sometimes well 90 of every game i play is on
[24895.42s -> 24901.86s]  stream but i only have a few hours sometimes
[24901.86s -> 24907.02s]  just jump into i actually restarted sakiro
[24907.02s -> 24909.98s]  not yesterday the day i mean like a couple then maybe like three or four
[24909.98s -> 24913.22s]  weeks ago i like restarted it and played it
[24913.22s -> 24917.06s]  like kind of casually off and on to do the other
[24917.06s -> 24923.70s]  stuff and i'm just still kind of letting it play out
[24923.70s -> 24927.06s]  does it feel weird to not talk while you play no not really
[24927.06s -> 24935.42s]  the game has no replayability well it doesn't have
[24935.42s -> 24939.22s]  in the traditional sense no but there's a
[24939.22s -> 24943.45s]  couple of endings that you there's like three or four bosses that i
[24943.45s -> 24949.37s]  didn't see so this content that i didn't get to
[24949.37s -> 24952.33s]  play and i would get to play it if i did
[24952.33s -> 24955.61s]  through go went through one more time right there's something like that has
[24955.61s -> 24957.69s]  like four or five different endings there's like
[24957.69s -> 24960.65s]  other content and bosses and stuff that you can get it with a different
[24960.65s -> 24965.85s]  stuff maybe from what i understand that is
[24965.85s -> 24968.73s]  replayability yeah but not in like the the dark souls kind of
[24968.73s -> 24972.17s]  replayability where there's the bosses are oh you can go and do
[24972.17s -> 24974.65s]  whatever you want but you can pick a different weapon and take a
[24974.65s -> 24977.53s]  different class and try a different spell and
[24977.53s -> 24984.54s]  you can replay through sakiro a few times maybe twice three times maybe if
[24984.54s -> 24989.50s]  you want to get all the endings and but the game stays
[24989.50s -> 24992.30s]  the same unless you know obviously i don't want to
[24992.30s -> 24995.34s]  keep i don't want to keep having i want spoilers to not be here
[24995.34s -> 25000.22s]  anyone that hasn't played it yet but there's like three or four what plus
[25000.22s -> 25012.10s]  endings right i've ever played enter the gungeon
[25012.10s -> 25019.37s]  yes i have depends on how much you like it whatever floats your boat
[25019.37s -> 25022.65s]  oh yeah if you like something and you do it and you want to play it
[25022.65s -> 25026.23s]  through more than three four five six ten times how
[25026.23s -> 25029.59s]  you know it's it's your time and it's your money right like if you buy
[25029.59s -> 25031.43s]  something and you want to spend the time doing it
[25031.43s -> 25044.12s]  absolutely is this the is this vod worth watching
[25044.12s -> 25048.92s]  absolutely yes all right bye sure is it vod worth watching
[25048.92s -> 25061.78s]  we got a question here hey hey hey what wait wait no you're memeing me here
[25061.78s -> 25064.02s]  what about we have a lot of fun with that what about
[25064.02s -> 25066.42s]  batman all right just skip the batman part
[25066.42s -> 25069.46s]  and then rewind and watch all the rest of it because it's good
[25069.46s -> 25087.75s]  i can't believe i i clicked a porn game i actually did that tonight
[25087.75s -> 25101.13s]  holy shit well it was text only and these are our imaginations and chat
[25101.13s -> 25106.25s]  really had to use their imaginations because they didn't get to see anything
[25106.25s -> 25109.45s]  no but all jokes aside i i loved it i had a lot of fun tonight
[25109.45s -> 25114.09s]  and we're gonna definitely do it again so yes go watch the bot don't
[25114.09s -> 25123.05s]  come on uh hey thank you too uh we got multi-trip earlier thanks to
[25123.05s -> 25125.13s]  the 10 bucks multi-trip i had a dream that you couldn't get any of
[25125.13s -> 25127.37s]  the dos games to work and got really frustrated
[25127.45s -> 25130.73s]  and streamed more to how instead that would have happened that's probably
[25130.73s -> 25135.05s]  exactly and now we probably just went to sam and max if this was a catastrophe
[25135.05s -> 25139.51s]  stream i would have just went right to episode three
[25139.51s -> 25145.08s]  in a second it would have taken one second but thank you the 10 dollars
[25145.08s -> 25149.00s]  thank you the jack for the 250 if you decide to give jazz jack
[25149.00s -> 25152.84s]  rabbit 2 a try there's a fan project called jazz
[25152.84s -> 25155.80s]  jack rabbit 2 plus that adds a bunch of fixes and
[25155.80s -> 25159.48s]  quality of life improvements including xbox controller support
[25159.48s -> 25170.20s]  to like a 25 year old game holy shit how do people even do this
[25170.20s -> 25175.91s]  some big brains out there i will definitely keep that in mind though
[25175.91s -> 25180.34s]  i guess we'll be doing this again i got sam and max in the back pocket
[25180.34s -> 25186.70s]  always but i'll keep that in mind thanks
[25186.70s -> 25191.82s]  to the 250 the jack uh freudian weapon thanks to the 250
[25191.82s -> 25193.74s]  i'll be honest i've never played chrono trigger
[25193.74s -> 25197.18s]  but i've had so many friends geek out about it that i feel inclined to
[25197.18s -> 25202.34s]  check it out sometime it is the best turn-based rpg that
[25202.34s -> 25213.46s]  has ever been made it's just it just is it was very well
[25213.46s -> 25219.99s]  before its time i think it's the best turn-based rpg
[25219.99s -> 25232.95s]  i i that's i don't that's just my opinion
[25232.95s -> 25236.89s]  here comes a back pedal no no back pedal
[25236.89s -> 25240.41s]  i think chrono trigger is the best rpg turn-based
[25240.41s -> 25244.33s]  remember we're not i'm not talking action rpg that's diablo 2
[25244.33s -> 25250.12s]  i'll do it for you turn-based rpg chrono trigger
[25250.12s -> 25258.52s]  uh action rpg diablo 2 what are the rpgs are there role playing rpg
[25258.52s -> 25267.43s]  no um what's another what's another one mmo rpg
[25267.43s -> 25271.93s]  oh that's a tough one i'd have to say world of warcraft
[25271.93s -> 25277.72s]  the frozen throne wrath of the lich king that's the best mmo rpg
[25277.72s -> 25298.49s]  what's the best fps rpg uh fps rpg fps rpg let me think about this
[25299.06s -> 25302.42s]  i mean they really only are a kind of a handful is like the fallout there's
[25302.42s -> 25307.05s]  like borderlands which i would not put borderlands even on that list
[25307.05s -> 25321.11s]  i don't think so um i don't think borderland i don't think borderlands
[25321.11s -> 25325.51s]  is like a top like two or three i i wouldn't
[25325.51s -> 25328.01s]  put borderlands in the top three for me
[25328.01s -> 25331.93s]  for first person shooter rpgs i put new vegas would be there
[25331.93s -> 25336.92s]  but new vegas is also not you can do that in third person
[25336.92s -> 25343.80s]  um might and magic dark messiah yeah that's number one
[25343.80s -> 25354.09s]  bioshock is yeah that's not really an rpg cyberpunk
[25354.09s -> 25361.16s]  well when cyberpunk comes out i think all bets are off borderlands
[25361.16s -> 25364.52s]  borderlands 1 was cool borderlands 2 was all right it just they kind of did
[25364.52s -> 25368.90s]  the same game three times they did that like borderlands pre
[25368.90s -> 25370.98s]  sequel and it's just like what the fuck are you doing
[25370.98s -> 25380.34s]  and then borderlands 3 it's just like all right it's i
[25380.34s -> 25383.38s]  i like borderlands 1 like borderlands 2 it's just kind of like i
[25383.38s -> 25389.88s]  it's we're kind of if you like just loot
[25389.88s -> 25392.92s]  boxes and shooting and different combinations and yeah it can be
[25392.92s -> 25395.32s]  addicting i just kind of got sick of it after
[25395.32s -> 25410.01s]  the second game i have heard the telltale borderlands
[25410.01s -> 25414.95s]  game is that weirdly enough i have been told that
[25414.95s -> 25422.55s]  tales from the borderlands is the best borderlands game
[25422.55s -> 25428.41s]  i've been told that a couple of times yeah i've been told that at
[25428.41s -> 25441.13s]  least twice it's easily the best telltale game
[25441.13s -> 25449.64s]  yeah um i'm trying to think of what other
[25449.64s -> 25457.10s]  first-person rpgs exist it's definitely dark messiah
[25457.10s -> 25461.62s]  that game is just so hilariously interesting
[25461.62s -> 25471.34s]  um a skyrim but i don't know if that does do the bethesda games
[25471.34s -> 25477.91s]  count because they don't they're not first person was dark
[25477.91s -> 25481.19s]  messiah actually a good game it seemed like a meme no it is it
[25481.19s -> 25488.55s]  i mean it is a meme but it's still a really fun game
[25488.55s -> 25504.23s]  fallout 76 those servers still on i'm actually serious
[25504.23s -> 25512.33s]  i don't know if they are or not uh we got some news today out of
[25512.33s -> 25523.10s]  uh the game development uh nhl 2k11 nba 2k14
[25523.10s -> 25530.09s]  fantasy star online 2 and fallout 76 have had their servers
[25530.09s -> 25546.50s]  discontinued today oh fuck really that's too bad
[25546.50s -> 25554.15s]  what's my favorite animal armadillo that's an easy one next question
[25554.15s -> 25561.96s]  but yeah there's a few games classic wow
[25561.96s -> 25566.71s]  yeah it's gonna be fun i think unless if blizzard could just
[25566.71s -> 25572.42s]  fuck it all up my faith in blizzard is
[25572.42s -> 25576.70s]  right at the front door it's just right outside at this point
[25576.70s -> 25579.58s]  it's like if you all right you come are you gonna what are you doing
[25579.58s -> 25583.50s]  here come on in show put put the put the
[25583.50s -> 25586.54s]  like roadmap of your game up on the glass
[25586.54s -> 25590.30s]  before i let you in the store just go to my like you know just
[25590.30s -> 25592.95s]  hold it up
[25597.53s -> 25606.36s]  all right come on in road maps are a lie
[25606.36s -> 25610.04s]  no blizzard i think blizzard's in an interesting scenario here
[25610.04s -> 25613.80s]  where they've made like two or three really really like bogus bonehead
[25613.80s -> 25618.41s]  plays in the last three four years that
[25618.49s -> 25626.57s]  wow classic needs to be good because they had
[25626.57s -> 25631.80s]  war warcraft 3's remake and wild classic coming back need to be pretty
[25631.80s -> 25636.84s]  good or they've got to announce something
[25636.84s -> 25638.60s]  that they're working on because a lot of people are not
[25638.60s -> 25643.78s]  happy it's going to be wild classic yeah but
[25643.78s -> 25647.30s]  i weren't they talking about how they were thinking of changing some stuff
[25647.30s -> 25650.50s]  weren't they saying that they were changing things and they were trying to
[25650.50s -> 25652.82s]  make it like more streamlined they they did mention that they were
[25652.82s -> 25656.82s]  going to do stuff to it right it's i don't think it's just wow
[25657.46s -> 25668.70s]  patch 1.2 so who knows they might they went back on that did they did
[25668.70s -> 25672.54s]  they go back on that i don't know we'll see what they end up
[25672.54s -> 25682.04s]  doing diablo is doomed wow expansion's bad
[25682.04s -> 25686.90s]  hawts is dead overwatch is kind of hanging on
[25686.90s -> 25692.47s]  overwatch is on death's door it's a shame yeah
[25692.47s -> 25699.85s]  they just they dropped the ball at least a few times
[25699.85s -> 25702.89s]  they kind of pulled a valve but valve just before they made a bunch
[25702.97s -> 25707.94s]  of bad plays just like forfeited the game you know what i
[25707.94s -> 25724.30s]  mean wasn't these glasses although valve
[25724.30s -> 25729.05s]  is slowly slowly they've been working kind of behind the scenes here
[25729.05s -> 25732.25s]  with this whole vr stuff and they got at least three or four games in
[25732.25s -> 25735.38s]  development here that are going to be exclusive to
[25735.38s -> 25741.11s]  the index right yep yep fuck me right i think i'll
[25741.11s -> 25745.45s]  get the htc vibe all of a sudden hey the index is
[25745.45s -> 25749.78s]  coming out it's gonna have like three exclusive valve games
[25749.78s -> 25763.91s]  they're not exclusive thank god i was so scared there for a second
[25763.91s -> 25767.75s]  but valve got to that point where people were like hey what the hell's
[25767.75s -> 25770.47s]  going on here what's this what's this thing that you
[25770.47s -> 25773.99s]  released that i'm not very happy with they were just like i quit i'm done
[25773.99s -> 25776.63s]  making games forever bye and then it's like
[25776.63s -> 25782.50s]  slam the door and like put put up like an out of order sign
[25782.50s -> 25787.72s]  blizzard had that same scenario except they were like what about this game
[25787.72s -> 25790.92s]  uh that's i don't like that what about this one this one's that kind of stupid
[25790.92s -> 25792.68s]  too no we don't want that what about this
[25792.68s -> 25795.24s]  one this one sucks no we don't want that either
[25795.24s -> 25803.77s]  and now they've kind of buried themselves hey yeah we gotta go grocery
[25803.77s -> 25807.21s]  shopping oh shit that's right we're gonna go grocery shopping
[25807.21s -> 25816.70s]  we're almost done we're almost done uh but
[25816.70s -> 25819.66s]  gabe newell actually said something like people not liking mass effect
[25819.66s -> 25827.85s]  three caused him to stop deving on half like three really
[25827.85s -> 25830.01s]  valve doesn't have investors to answer to so they don't have to
[25830.01s -> 25832.81s]  pressure to output games yeah i think i think valve made the
[25832.81s -> 25836.01s]  right call with that because if they didn't think they
[25836.01s -> 25839.45s]  could make good products then they weren't going to make them
[25839.45s -> 25843.13s]  i think that's been their mo for a long time it's kind of it's
[25843.13s -> 25845.93s]  sucks that you don't we don't we don't get it left for dead three we
[25845.93s -> 25849.37s]  don't have like a big huge tf3 or team fortress
[25849.37s -> 25852.65s]  update right that's changes the game that much
[25852.65s -> 25857.53s]  we got artifact but i don't i don't play i don't that doesn't do it for
[25857.53s -> 25862.14s]  me at all it's a card game i don't really play them
[25862.14s -> 25866.46s]  and then they they just kind of went into the business side of games which
[25866.46s -> 25870.09s]  you could argue is you know might not been the greatest
[25870.09s -> 25873.93s]  thing in the grand scheme of things because that's how we kind of invented
[25873.93s -> 25878.04s]  the whole open boxes for money thing that was
[25878.04s -> 25885.66s]  valve valve kind of paved the way for that
[25885.66s -> 25889.98s]  the open up loot boxes for cash was like a team fortress and counter
[25889.98s -> 25897.69s]  strike thing tf2 crates and yeah even they took
[25897.69s -> 25902.09s]  that from like what those old japanese
[25902.09s -> 25913.14s]  mobile games right fifa yeah fifa with the card packs
[25913.14s -> 25919.06s]  but not like a box with stuff in it be like the card packs were just uh you
[25919.06s -> 25924.14s]  opened up card packs right fifa is patient zero but valve
[25924.14s -> 25930.73s]  really perfected that open up the box and get an item for the game
[25930.73s -> 25934.55s]  it's the same it is the same idea but the fifa cards didn't affect
[25934.55s -> 25950.66s]  anything in the game right did they did they wait hold on the
[25950.66s -> 25953.22s]  fifa cards i thought it was like you just opened up
[25953.22s -> 25959.30s]  cards and had like a card collection with like golds and stuff
[25959.30s -> 25970.54s]  you actually do you that's how you get the players
[25970.54s -> 25981.21s]  oh my god fifa is paid to win no really wow holy shit
[25981.21s -> 25991.72s]  okay well that's unbelievable but uh the ea fifa even as early as
[25991.72s -> 25998.55s]  you know team fortress that all the kind of open up boxes get new weapon or new
[25998.55s -> 26008.89s]  skin right they expire oh my goodness that's evil
[26008.89s -> 26013.43s]  if they expire you have to keep opening them
[26013.43s -> 26019.91s]  holy shit but i think that will they'll turn
[26019.91s -> 26024.25s]  well there'll be a turnaround here regardless of all the you know the
[26024.25s -> 26026.97s]  crazy fucked up shit that's happening in this industry right now
[26026.97s -> 26030.33s]  in the last four or five years and there'll be a
[26030.33s -> 26033.29s]  turnaround there'll be some there'll be there'll be some new
[26033.29s -> 26036.25s]  shit that's interesting that i think that some of these companies
[26036.25s -> 26037.69s]  are going to start to realize that people
[26037.69s -> 26041.05s]  are annoyed by this kind of behavior they don't like this shit nobody likes
[26041.05s -> 26045.83s]  this shit so unfortunately the people that
[26045.83s -> 26047.91s]  are playing the games that have been playing games for the last five to
[26047.91s -> 26051.99s]  ten years kind of had to be the the guinea pigs for all this stuff
[26051.99s -> 26055.35s]  until everyone was like hey could you stop doing this to us please
[26055.35s -> 26058.39s]  oh shit i'm sorry i didn't think that you don't like this
[26058.39s -> 26065.18s]  fucked up kind of behavior yeah i guess we'll stop
[26065.18s -> 26073.77s]  did you beat mario and checkers yet i smoked him
[26073.77s -> 26079.18s]  people love this shit it makes all the money yeah but
[26079.18s -> 26083.62s]  people like to gamble too you know it it's all that's all it is it
[26083.62s -> 26087.86s]  scratches the same itch as pulling like a slot machine lever why
[26087.86s -> 26092.98s]  how do you think casinos are so popular
[26092.98s -> 26097.94s]  it's the same idea a potential random generated thing where you could
[26097.94s -> 26107.24s]  get something awesome or something terrible
[26107.24s -> 26115.18s]  you're the expert on gambling i see i'm telling you i know
[26115.18s -> 26118.76s]  but i uh i gotta get out of here gotta go to the grocery store before they
[26118.76s -> 26121.88s]  close so let's get through the last uh handful
[26121.88s -> 26124.12s]  of bits let's get the credits on the screen too
[26124.12s -> 26130.44s]  we can sit here and talk for hours about uh the state of the game
[26130.44s -> 26136.06s]  industry i'm not necessarily an expert on all
[26136.06s -> 26142.50s]  this but i do have some opinions as you've heard
[26142.50s -> 26146.20s]  but get the credits on the screen here come all the new subs and all the
[26146.20s -> 26157.21s]  resubs for today thank you everybody there were a lot just don't play bad
[26157.21s -> 26165.62s]  games but that was a big one that was
[26165.62s -> 26172.66s]  like three or four at the same time does somebody think it was vinnie's
[26172.66s -> 26177.02s]  birthday today i mean if it's vinnie's birthday we're
[26177.02s -> 26178.54s]  gonna is it vinnie is it actually vinnie's
[26178.54s -> 26185.70s]  birthday or is somebody just uh somebody's messing around actually
[26185.70s -> 26189.80s]  vinnie's birthday is it for real can we can we
[26189.80s -> 26193.88s]  confirm that before i send 1500 people to this channel to say

[26227.61s -> 26237.00s]  viewer raid jesus uh it's actually like 14
[26237.00s -> 26241.32s]  1500 i think that's a lot more than 50
[26241.32s -> 26249.48s]  oh no it's in new york right so 10 11 12 oh okay yeah no it is
[26249.48s -> 26253.48s]  new york happy birthday to vinnie it's it's it's 12 it's think that one
[26253.48s -> 26257.77s]  o'clock in the morning happy birthday vinnie
[26257.77s -> 26274.92s]  50 viewer raid geez man some of you guys are vicious
[26274.92s -> 26278.68s]  all right so we're gonna raid vinnie but we're gonna do get the last bit
[26278.68s -> 26284.18s]  so there's like two or three more uh but the chrono trigger kind of
[26284.18s -> 26287.54s]  tangent was from frody and weapon that got us on there 250
[26287.54s -> 26290.82s]  play chrono trigger it's an amazing game snooze and copter thanks to the
[26290.82s -> 26295.27s]  250 i know i could have put this in recommended
[26295.27s -> 26298.31s]  but i want to hear direct thoughts on it in chats too i really want to see you
[26298.31s -> 26300.95s]  stream a game you know and played before
[26300.95s -> 26304.47s]  and just show us that haven't played its secrets and whatnot
[26304.47s -> 26307.35s]  just guide us through and show us why you enjoy it so much
[26307.35s -> 26310.31s]  games like resident evil 4 chrono trigger whatever game is up
[26310.31s -> 26315.56s]  in your top 10 i mean i could do that
[26315.56s -> 26322.41s]  if people really wanted me to do that i could do it
[26322.41s -> 26327.08s]  play like mario rpg and show you everything and why i think it's so
[26327.08s -> 26330.36s]  cool and fun play chrono trigger it's it's an
[26330.36s -> 26335.16s]  interesting idea that'd be cool it'd be different that
[26335.16s -> 26342.62s]  sounds like fun yeah let's we'll plan on it let's plan
[26342.62s -> 26347.40s]  on it could be nostalgic mario rpg i would probably start with
[26347.40s -> 26350.62s]  mario rpg that's my favorite game ever made
[26350.62s -> 26355.43s]  so i would probably start there the drama classics
[26355.43s -> 26359.64s]  well i didn't make them but that's a great recommendation thank you
[26359.64s -> 26363.98s]  snooze and copter i've toyed with it we've talked
[26363.98s -> 26366.38s]  about it a few times i just never pulled the trigger on it because i
[26366.38s -> 26368.94s]  just don't know if people want to see somebody
[26368.94s -> 26371.74s]  just go oh i know what's here i know what's over here go look this is go
[26371.74s -> 26373.74s]  watch this part hey you should watch this part of the movie this is where
[26373.74s -> 26375.66s]  this is the part where you get to where he dies
[26375.66s -> 26378.78s]  you know i feel like i'd be that guy at the movie that tells you the cool
[26378.78s -> 26388.66s]  parts to watch but you know it is um it is what it
[26388.66s -> 26391.88s]  is maybe i'll take the uh take the dive
[26391.88s -> 26398.79s]  the neverhood neverhood's hard to get to work past a certain point
[26398.79s -> 26404.95s]  i just wish they would release it remake it somebody got gg is not on
[26404.95s -> 26409.29s]  top of that that's surprising but fraud in weapon
[26409.29s -> 26412.57s]  thanks for the 250 how dare you tell me to take care of myself the nerve of you
[26412.57s -> 26415.74s]  to be nice to me but seriously i love you streams and
[26415.74s -> 26421.54s]  everything germa pop here here thank you uh
[26421.54s -> 26424.18s]  froding you've been around for a long time you've given a lot of money
[26424.18s -> 26428.18s]  big part of the stream community especially when we hang out here at
[26428.18s -> 26431.80s]  the end so thank you and of course i'm gonna be nice to
[26431.80s -> 26436.04s]  you the nerve of me how dare i and fraud in weapon 250 one
[26436.04s -> 26438.20s]  more thing the bit readings are probably my favorite part of these
[26438.20s -> 26441.00s]  streams because of all the funny jokes chat comes up with
[26441.00s -> 26447.26s]  and i guess in germa heart and germa pops for chat germa heart germa pop
[26447.26s -> 26453.10s]  yeah no i like the ending of the streams it's like a 45
[26453.10s -> 26459.53s]  30 to 50 minute experience where chat slows down we can talk about
[26459.53s -> 26469.19s]  stuff we can people write funny shit easier for me to read it i agree i
[26469.19s -> 26472.55s]  also love it too and that is gonna be my time i
[26472.55s -> 26482.01s]  will see you guys next week on tuesday no no not tuesday wait
