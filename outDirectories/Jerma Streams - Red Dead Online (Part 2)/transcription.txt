[8.31s -> 31.19s]  I've returned. Let's see if this'll stay on and if it'll work. Meme incoming. Where's
[31.19s -> 38.87s]  Otto? He's lying down. Downstairs. Just hanging out. I said hello to him. I said hi to him
[38.87s -> 46.25s]  for you guys. As well. Said hey, chat says hi. Wagged his tail a little bit. Gave him
[46.25s -> 55.08s]  a pat. So I just tried to load up into a online just random deathmatch mission to
[55.08s -> 85.14s]  see what happened. Well, if it's having problems for people now, what the hell is gonna happen
[85.14s -> 91.94s]  when they open it up tomorrow or the next day to potentially 100 to 200 percent more people?
[96.79s -> 121.16s]  I don't know. Is the GTA 5 launch all over again? Only 25 percent of those people
[121.16s -> 129.83s]  we actually be able to play. Yeah, I don't think, I mean, unless it's a regional thing.
[129.83s -> 137.10s]  Those of you guys that are having problems, what region are you in? If you're seeing the
[137.10s -> 142.76s]  same disconnect every 10 minutes, every 20 minutes thing, are you West Coast? Or does
[142.76s -> 158.06s]  it, does it even matter? West Elizabeth. All right. Well, I'm in. I'm currently in
[159.75s -> 177.26s]  and there are players here, right? There are. There are players. So this is, if the hat fits,
[179.51s -> 186.02s]  it's right here. Let's see if I can get it to work. Let's see if I can play a mission.
[188.68s -> 202.46s]  Just send me a shitty horse. That's fine. Never do it for free. Level eight stamina.
[202.46s -> 212.30s]  What's the highest stamina you can have? Go fast, go fast, go fast. The faster I've gone,
[212.30s -> 225.32s]  the actually the more I've been able to connect. Hyenas, watch out. This, yes,
[225.32s -> 231.24s]  this is online. We are now in online. How long we will be here is the real question.
[231.96s -> 255.93s]  Howdy. Start matchmaking. Get us in the game. If this horse goes under 45 miles per hour,
[255.93s -> 268.92s]  we're all dead. When do you get the ability to sell pelts? Look at that character.
[269.48s -> 281.35s]  Okay, game details. Oh, horribly directed towards the Blackwater police chief in
[281.35s -> 285.11s]  Pike's Basin. Con man and outlaws on the loose. Where the justice is done will depend
[285.11s -> 292.82s]  on your honor. Let's go. So we, we're gonna try to take this guy alive as a crew here.
[293.54s -> 301.88s]  You're an ambassador. A what? An idiot. I'm sorry. He said he wouldn't run away. Shut up.
[301.88s -> 308.14s]  But please. But just shut up. I don't think you can. They're gonna fire me.
[309.18s -> 314.86s]  Oh, you, you get to keep your job, but they'll fire me and they've got every right to fire me
[314.86s -> 322.30s]  because I'm the idiot who employed you. Oh, look, guests. Skip 103.
[326.46s -> 333.50s]  You can't be any worse than us because this idiot, this idiot right here, just let the
[333.50s -> 340.22s]  most notorious con man in the whole goddamn state walk clean out of a cell, clean out
[340.30s -> 349.19s]  and not a shot fired. Now you get him back for us. We'll happily pay you.
[349.19s -> 353.03s]  Are you with the same players earlier? I don't think so. How about that? That'd be very odd.
[355.02s -> 362.47s]  Good, good. Now see what I figure is I figure he's headed on down to Pike's Basin.
[362.47s -> 368.15s]  So you go down the canyon and you get it almost over and I'm gonna beat this poor dumb
[368.15s -> 373.43s]  bastard with a stick. I just didn't skip into the very beginning, but
[374.79s -> 378.79s]  if you're gonna sit through the movie, you're gonna get up right before the big reveal happens.
[379.67s -> 391.67s]  All right, go to camp. Oh, I took, we're taking all the wrong horses.
[393.51s -> 406.23s]  Nice musical chairs. All right, we're good. We get two lives. Track this guy down.
[406.47s -> 429.18s]  Watch it. Easy, easy. The gang is protecting the outlaw. Take them out. Sorry, sorry. Explosion.
[429.18s -> 464.54s]  Watch this. Ready? I'm the cool one. Okay, a couple more left. Okay. Have I been shooting
[464.54s -> 479.42s]  the rock the whole time? Someone's coming up. Hold them there. Just shoot the fucking rock.
[480.14s -> 501.61s]  I'm gonna get low score. No, I'm not. Go get the outlaw. No, don't stop. Don't, no.
[502.25s -> 512.81s]  Lose all of our lives. Okay. Well, it's gonna, we'll leave this up to you.
[514.20s -> 521.00s]  You just go get the outlaw. What are you doing? Where's the outlaw?
[531.21s -> 541.45s]  Okay, we're so stupid. This is not how this is supposed to be done.
[545.91s -> 562.50s]  Hog tie the outlaw. How are we gonna get him back up? Anybody have a horse?
[565.24s -> 584.34s]  Okay, let's go. Deliver the outlaw in one piece. What just happened? Oh no. Oh, this is not good.
[584.34s -> 589.30s]  All right, you guys gotta protect me. Protect me. Protect me. I'm the guy with the outlaw on my
[589.30s -> 610.31s]  back. We can't die. Dying is bad. Up there. On the cliff too. I think we have to just,
[610.31s -> 625.10s]  we have to get out of here. We have to leave. That's it, right? No, I need a horse.
[627.96s -> 633.42s]  All right, I'll take care of the outlaw. You guys just keep me,
[634.30s -> 645.48s]  you're on my horse. That's my horse. I love this how all over the place this happens every time.
[647.30s -> 652.60s]  All right, let's go. Just have to deliver him and he's gonna be alive. We're gonna get a good
[652.60s -> 669.85s]  bounty for it. Just watch. Yep, I knew it was gonna happen. What just happened? You can't
[669.85s -> 689.78s]  whistle for your horse right now. Guy to your left. Horse, get over here. Oh no, no, no,
[690.02s -> 717.08s]  he's gonna die. Get him up. Revive him before we lose. Okay, there we go. Epic teamwork.
[717.80s -> 736.73s]  Are we good? Good guy, Jerma. Oh, what you mean to say is team lives one. More explosions.
[738.09s -> 757.02s]  Explosions. Now, this mission's been fun. This is a cool one. I can totally see me doing
[757.02s -> 780.92s]  with, with like star, you know what I mean? Italic, Vinny. Yeah, once this is more stable,
[780.92s -> 784.84s]  this would be fun to have like three or four people. I would definitely do this again.
[785.96s -> 794.97s]  Instead of being like a QA tester, I'd like to get into it. Who are the current teammates?
[795.85s -> 820.01s]  Uh, yeah, just a couple of other YouTubers. You know, I gotta hit the explosion. See off
[820.01s -> 838.28s]  the gang. See off. That's it. All right, we need a horse. Drop the outlaw by the camp.
[839.16s -> 853.40s]  Why are we doing it like this? Let me go. Let me go. I've got money. I've got a lot of money
[853.40s -> 859.53s]  and I'll pay. I'll pay a lot. Hey, here's an idea. Take my hat. Put it on the dead guy
[859.53s -> 866.18s]  over there. You take him in as me. I go free and you get rich. Oh, and I won't kill
[866.18s -> 873.14s]  anybody else. I swear I'm reformed. I'm a changed man. I'm reformed. I'm better. Please,
[873.62s -> 877.94s]  please. I'm begging you. Set me free. Have a heart. Do we have to vote on this?
[882.38s -> 889.91s]  Refuse offer. Oh my god. Take offer or let the timer expire. Refu- I got it. I got majority.
[896.34s -> 914.41s]  I got majority. I really would like his hat. Sean's back. It's a pretty ugly hat
[914.41s -> 926.66s]  anyways. It kind of, yeah, it is. It is a really ugly hat, but is the material it's made out of
[926.66s -> 947.90s]  expensive? It could very well be. I probably shouldn't do that again. Don't stop in front
[947.90s -> 969.83s]  of me. Did she just fall off? Grandma got DC'd.
[983.56s -> 1011.83s]  Excuse me. Feed the ho- yeah, this guy does look really good. It is a gorgeous guy. Cried
[1011.83s -> 1036.86s]  into a rock. Not after how long that took. Take him in. I could have just jumped to horse.
[1037.50s -> 1043.34s]  So you got him? Seven dollars. Real good. Look. Put him up on my horse there. I didn't do nothing.
[1043.34s -> 1049.26s]  There's the money I promised you. It's nice seeing you again, buddy. Seven dollars. That's enough for me to
[1051.74s -> 1055.90s]  take a ride to Blackwater. Just name your price and I'll make you rich.
[1061.30s -> 1065.30s]  See you later. I made the money back that I wasted on the horse, yeah? I did.
[1065.94s -> 1075.45s]  Free hat? No, we didn't get the hat. You get the hat if you let him live.
[1076.17s -> 1089.98s]  No, you don't turn him in. Hey, I got to play Red Dead Online for 30 minutes.
[1091.46s -> 1113.24s]  And we're still here? Yeah, don't jinx it. We'll see. No, we're still here.
[1118.70s -> 1150.02s]  Alright. What was that? Snake? Whoa, that's a perfect rattlesnake. How do I
[1150.58s -> 1188.97s]  not destroy the meat here? Once was good. I was scared. It costs money to just be alive in this
[1188.97s -> 1234.17s]  game. Does this person hide in the cactuses? Don't remind me. Just existing. Can I interact
[1234.17s -> 1249.13s]  with them? I just disconnected him. Oh no, I just made that guy DC.
[1253.40s -> 1258.30s]  Right now he's probably sitting in his room. What the fuck? I just DC'd again.
[1259.61s -> 1284.63s]  Why? What happened? God damn it. He's back. No, it's not. It's a different guy. How long do
[1284.63s -> 1297.14s]  they stay like this for? Hold on. This guy is just... I just have this guy. I fucking DC'd him
[1297.14s -> 1322.98s]  too. Oh, just the fucking serial disconnector. There's somebody else over here now. There he is.
[1322.98s -> 1353.86s]  What? Hold on a second. Why could I not hogtie him? I died instantly.
[1360.09s -> 1365.21s]  He wasn't even looking. He just swung in a circle and hit me right in the head and hit me in the
[1365.21s -> 1381.58s]  temple. So what's over here? Where are they? I think they got DC'd. He used all the power of
[1381.58s -> 1405.82s]  his internet to hit me and then disconnected. So what am I chasing over here? There they are.
[1406.62s -> 1421.42s]  Oh no, that's very far away. No, that person's not even here. See? Let's head to town. Let's
[1421.42s -> 1429.22s]  try to make some friends. I want to lasso somebody in the bar and then throw them over
[1429.22s -> 1450.65s]  the balcony and then run away. Making new death train. Make friends in a rock star game. Good
[1450.65s -> 1455.29s]  luck. Yo, that's what I mean. Another few days or so. I feel like maybe like a week
[1455.29s -> 1467.58s]  and they get all the bugs ironed out. Come in with like a group of like three or four people
[1467.58s -> 1500.06s]  and just have some fun. I think that's gonna be the plan. What the hell was that? What? Why
[1500.06s -> 1514.66s]  did I let it come? Was I just not close enough? Oh, they can break free. So you gotta be real
[1514.66s -> 1549.58s]  close to even attempt it. Come here! It takes so long to get over to them. Press the melee
[1549.58s -> 1552.38s]  button? Well, I have to be close enough to do it.
[1563.90s -> 1604.23s]  Come here! I'm gonna get you with this. Oh! Can't break out of that. This is so odd. Wait, what?
[1626.06s -> 1630.94s]  Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit!
[1661.96s -> 1663.16s]  Oh, the disconnect.
[1664.70s -> 1676.74s]  I just ran into a stop sign. Imagine being on his end and watching that. Oh, I would be dead.
[1677.62s -> 1683.13s]  I would kill me. I would be dead. You'd have to resurrect me.
[1704.76s -> 1718.34s]  It reminds me of once when I kicked sand at somebody in elementary school
[1718.98s -> 1721.14s]  and turned to run and smacked into a pole.
[1721.14s -> 1732.25s]  I love that shit. It's so stupid. So okay, so you can break out if you're actually hogtied
[1732.25s -> 1746.97s]  and stowed. So what's the point of being hogtied and stowed if it lasts like 10 seconds? I would
[1746.97s -> 1761.77s]  love if that lasted like at least five minutes. I would so I would love to be hogtied and just
[1761.77s -> 1768.52s]  brought around and just... Yeah, I hear you. It'd be so funny.
[1770.95s -> 1780.12s]  All right, a rival gang is doing something. Imagine just being part of somebody else's
[1780.12s -> 1790.18s]  video game where you're just an NPC but you're not. I'm just having a conversation,
[1790.18s -> 1802.87s]  just hanging out. I'm just like, okay, I'm still here. All right, which one of these
[1802.87s -> 1807.51s]  rival gangs? Apparently, this is the rival gang I'm about to stop. I have to stop this
[1807.51s -> 1822.68s]  person here. Who? Who needs to be stopped? I don't see anybody. Maybe I wasn't fast enough.
[1822.68s -> 1843.75s]  Let's see if I can do it this time. No missions right now. Really? Because
[1844.63s -> 1854.70s]  you got nothing to do? You have nothing going on? Doesn't have any missions. Okay.
[1858.94s -> 1871.82s]  I guess that is a response. Yeah. So who we got? I can do another one of those story
[1871.82s -> 1881.24s]  missions. There seems to be a lot of people down here. Somebody right behind me.
[1883.59s -> 1894.65s]  Somebody overlooking the view down there. What does that marker mean? Index. What does it mean?
[1895.37s -> 1905.82s]  I don't understand what that means. Well, I'm gonna take the stagecoach to Saint Denis.
[1906.62s -> 1911.74s]  There's a lot of people down there. Let me spend all of my money to do that.
[1912.30s -> 1931.58s]  It's only three bucks. Never mind. We're good. There's a free revolver?
[1935.83s -> 1945.85s]  Well, I'll get it. I'll get it later. Can you rob people? I don't think you can just rob another
[1945.85s -> 1953.88s]  player. Unless it's a specific mission where you're trying to stop them. All right, here we
[1953.88s -> 1964.31s]  are. Saint Denis. Somebody this way. Somebody that way. This person's trying to go do this
[1964.31s -> 1973.86s]  mission, I think. So let's see if I can... No, maybe not. You got a mission?
[1982.52s -> 1990.28s]  All right, so I'm gonna be the target here.
[1994.54s -> 2000.42s]  Pick up the mail bag. Deliver the mail to a series of recipients within the time limit
[2000.42s -> 2011.30s]  to earn the full reward. Where's the mail? Where's the mail bag? Mail bag? Where's the mail bag?
[2020.78s -> 2029.90s]  I'm stuck in here now. I locked myself in with this fucking guy. What? How is that even possible?
[2030.62s -> 2048.20s]  The door is locked. Oh, I can't pick up the mail bag because I can't get out of the mail room.
[2048.20s -> 2072.94s]  I can't do it. I'm stuck here forever. Somebody help me. Somebody come help me.
[2076.15s -> 2092.26s]  How do I get someone to know that I'm in here? It makes me put it away immediately.
[2092.34s -> 2110.94s]  How do you whistle? Whistle? What's a whistle? What's a whistle? I can't punch him.
[2110.94s -> 2117.14s]  How do I whistle? I'm gonna... How do I invite everybody?
[2128.74s -> 2135.66s]  Somebody let the bird out. Respawn. I feel like I want to be in here though.
[2135.66s -> 2140.54s]  I feel like somebody could... This is gonna be fun. How do I invite people to my location?
[2141.26s -> 2158.23s]  Invites. Okay, this person here. Where's the nearest person? This person getting their
[2158.23s -> 2169.32s]  haircut right here. Damn it. How do I report myself? I can't. I'm stuck. Whatever.
[2170.76s -> 2174.44s]  Would have been kind of fun to be in here and be the guy that is locked in here.
[2190.84s -> 2211.22s]  How do I just respawn myself? Do I just go in and out? I'm just an NPC now. Quick join.
[2211.22s -> 2216.33s]  Just quick join again. Just wait out the 10 minutes and see what happens.
[2217.61s -> 2221.61s]  That's not a bad idea. That really isn't a bad idea.
[2222.97s -> 2239.48s]  Oh, I figured out what to do. Somebody help me. I'm stuck in here. Help me. Help.
[2239.48s -> 2245.72s]  Somebody just drove by. Somebody stop. I'm stuck in here. Somebody help me.
[2247.00s -> 2264.92s]  Help me. Help. Get in here and do something. Please. Help me. Open the door. See I...
[2265.72s -> 2283.48s]  I can't get out of here. See? Look. I tried everything. Help. Go get it. Go get some friend.
[2284.95s -> 2295.67s]  Go get some dynamite. Do anything. Blow this up. Help. No, don't go do a mission. Help me.
[2299.02s -> 2313.08s]  I'm in here. I tried the same thing. It doesn't work. There's a spot where I can shoot right
[2313.08s -> 2340.89s]  here. Got it. Where is it? Right here? Right there. This guy doesn't even care that I'm
[2340.89s -> 2345.45s]  just smashing the place up. Have them shoot through the window. Maybe they can shoot me
[2345.45s -> 2361.74s]  through the window. I got to get in the right place though. Time's counting down. I want to
[2361.74s -> 2370.97s]  see what happens. Okay. It needs to be perfect in the right position. No. A little bit more
[2370.97s -> 2401.72s]  to the right and right there. I was really hoping that I could shoot somebody from out
[2401.72s -> 2408.02s]  of there. If I knew that I could aim out the window like that and that guy stood there,
[2408.02s -> 2413.14s]  just put it between his eyes. And then his cause. Have him get angry to the point where
[2413.14s -> 2422.20s]  he needs to figure out a way to get him to get to me. At that point, he's going to throw a
[2422.20s -> 2446.34s]  dynamite into the window. Are Avans paying attention to what the players are doing? No.
[2447.78s -> 2454.68s]  It's just a problem with, for some reason. I don't know what it is with my west coast
[2454.68s -> 2461.48s]  connection to the Rockstar servers, but they don't want me on here. Rockstar's servers
[2461.48s -> 2470.54s]  for me just keep dropping. It's not my internet. My internet's fine. It's somehow
[2470.54s -> 2475.26s]  wherever I'm going doesn't like me there. Kill all the players to rise up the leaderboard the
[2475.26s -> 2486.50s]  higher you get, the more points you're worth. See if I can just play it. Rockstar, I hate your rat videos.
[2497.10s -> 2511.03s]  Well, I got to hear the... I got to at least hear it. Well, we're going on about six hours
[2511.03s -> 2525.61s]  here. It might be time to throw the towel in after like another couple attempts. Don't you
[2525.61s -> 2532.84s]  fucking... Well, the end of the stream voice. How good does it feel to say it's not my internet?
[2532.84s -> 2547.62s]  It actually feels pretty great. Do I have an opinion on online yet? No, I don't. I really don't.
[2550.46s -> 2559.64s]  It looks very fun. And from the random snippets of time that I get to be in it,
[2559.64s -> 2578.66s]  oh, it's great. It seems very cool once it's actually stable. He's doing the concerned
[2578.66s -> 2583.45s]  professional voice. Well, you know, you can give my opinion on the video game.
[2584.25s -> 2587.93s]  I'm going to sound at least somewhat professional so when somebody links this
[2588.57s -> 2603.90s]  to rockstar.com. All right, where are we right now? Is somebody over here?
[2604.78s -> 2620.73s]  Okay, I'm going to just go visit that person or try to do this mission. Hopefully I don't
[2620.73s -> 2630.74s]  get locked into the room, whatever the hell it is. I went around every inch of your
[2630.74s -> 2655.30s]  house except the one place to go in. Don't go inside, I'm gonna get trapped in here.
[2659.82s -> 2664.14s]  Why am I made out of plastic? My character is made out of plastic.
[2672.94s -> 2673.82s]  Android person.
[2677.74s -> 2682.54s]  I had them. I went away for a couple of days on a killing of a bastard.
[2684.54s -> 2686.54s]  Melting wax figurine.
[2692.06s -> 2696.86s]  I'll find them again. I've lost them before. You know, once was for three months it was.
[2696.86s -> 2703.34s]  That's how it goes, I guess. Anyway, where was it? Oh, yeah, yeah. Murder and mayhem.
[2704.30s -> 2710.09s]  Now to kill innocent folk myself gives me a real nasty feeling inside, but these bastards.
[2711.13s -> 2715.37s]  Where does this take place during the story? These bastards are. There's a stage. I'm actually
[2715.37s -> 2721.53s]  not sure. I heard a fella say it's laden with silver. I can't rob it. I can't guarantee
[2721.53s -> 2726.81s]  someone else hasn't gone before, but it'd be a rotten shame to let it pass, boy. Anyways,
[2726.81s -> 2742.02s]  armatures. All right, matchmaking time. Ambush and rob the stagecoach. Not matchmaking.
[2745.69s -> 2754.98s]  Stop the stagecoach and steal the loot bag within the time limit. I'm assuming there's
[2754.98s -> 2766.94s]  other people that are also doing this or trying to stop me from doing this. That would
[2766.94s -> 2780.12s]  be interesting. How far away is it? No, it's right there. That's convenient. Right in front
[2780.12s -> 2804.97s]  of me. Driver. Yeah, I'll try. There's so many people in there. There's a lot of people in here.
[2805.85s -> 2824.20s]  Full party in this wagon. Okay, target the passengers and take the loot. What?
[2825.00s -> 2839.48s]  They're going anywhere. Give me that loot bag. All right, get out of here.
[2842.49s -> 2858.34s]  Bag. All right, deliver the loot bag. Get out of the road. I can't stop. Get out of the road. I
[2858.34s -> 2884.54s]  can't stop. Rival players can steal the loot bag. They won't be doing that. That's damn, damn sure
[2884.54s -> 2902.78s]  about that. Well, he's dead. No, I'm too far away. I'm kind of in the middle of fucking nowhere.
[2906.23s -> 2917.16s]  Can you eat the bag? I don't think you can eat it. The horse is getting too tired.
[2922.68s -> 2928.60s]  Yeah, if I get disconnected here before turning this in, then I think that's a
[2928.60s -> 2933.06s]  throw the towel up in the air situation. That's what I think.
[2936.44s -> 2950.01s]  I got a bag and it's full of loot. Stuck in the loot bag. So what do I get for doing that?
[2952.52s -> 2959.78s]  One cent and two dollars. And you're telling me people can fight over that bag?
[2962.74s -> 2991.32s]  Why would you fight over that bag? This is my horse? Yeah, I can do a two bird.
[2996.41s -> 3002.49s]  Okay, let me go into the city center. Well, that would have been cool if somebody tried
[3002.49s -> 3015.56s]  to stop me. I think we're here alone. I don't think there's anybody in this session. God damn
[3015.56s -> 3062.82s]  it. That's why. Well, whoops. I think that's gonna be it. I think it's time to throw the
[3062.82s -> 3072.89s]  towel in. It's just not ready yet. At least for me to play it. Maybe you can stay connected
[3072.89s -> 3076.73s]  if you're from a part of the world or the country where you're able to stay connected.
[3077.53s -> 3083.22s]  A rock star does not want me to be connected to their game for some reason. I don't know why.
[3084.34s -> 3108.31s]  Sure is beautiful out here. I haven't dced all day. Yeah, I think it's just depending on what
[3108.31s -> 3113.35s]  region you're connecting to or where you're connecting from. King of the castle. All right,
[3113.99s -> 3136.98s]  a free roam event. Yes, I'll do it. Take me there. That's how I feel right now. Well,
[3136.98s -> 3152.20s]  thanks for coming to the stream. That's Red Dead Redemption 2 Online. You've been disconnected
[3152.20s -> 3166.81s]  from Red Dead Online due to a fault on Rockstar game services. Red Dead Offline. Yeah. Well,
[3166.81s -> 3172.41s]  it wasn't a total loss because there was some stuff to see there and hopefully over the next
[3172.41s -> 3179.99s]  day or two the service is brought up to the task of a higher standard to be able to be
[3180.07s -> 3186.60s]  allowed to connect to it. Stay connected to it. But that's going to be the end of the stream.
[3187.64s -> 3194.86s]  So again, let me make this very clear. Tomorrow night is the last day and night for you to do
[3194.86s -> 3201.51s]  a green screen submission from the green screen stream a couple weeks ago. If you want to put
[3201.51s -> 3204.47s]  something in, it's got to be at least 10 seconds. Can't be more than two minutes.
[3206.31s -> 3209.83s]  There are rules to read that are pinned in that Discord's channel.
[3210.63s -> 3215.67s]  Got to be a YouTube link because it's going to be going on a giant playlist
[3215.67s -> 3223.26s]  and that deadline is tomorrow. Tomorrow night. Submissions will not be considered
[3223.90s -> 3231.35s]  if they come in after tomorrow night. And with that, I will see you guys on Friday.
[3232.23s -> 3239.54s]  Friday, we're going to do Jackbox, which will lead us into Sunday, which will be the
[3239.54s -> 3248.02s]  green screen movie night. This should be the thumbnail and I may even stream on Saturday
[3248.02s -> 3253.86s]  as well. We might go Friday, Saturday, Sunday, depending on what's available because if Red Dead
[3253.86s -> 3259.86s]  works by Saturday, then maybe we'll do a thing where it's Friday is Jackbox, Saturday is
[3260.58s -> 3264.98s]  Red Dead Online. Maybe get a few friends, get a few people to join into a squad
[3265.70s -> 3272.46s]  and then Sunday will be movie night. So we'll give it a try. Do I have a schedule yet? I
[3272.46s -> 3278.07s]  don't. I don't. And I know it's been about three or four straight weeks here of streaming
[3278.07s -> 3289.11s]  in Vegas on Pacific time. And I'm like, yeah, I got a schedule. I don't know. Maybe I just won't.
[3293.24s -> 3301.34s]  Maybe I'll just stream because I look, here's the long and short of that. I've been streaming
[3301.34s -> 3307.64s]  more often since being here, right? Let me put the outro on so people don't think I'm
[3307.64s -> 3317.21s]  sticking around. I've been streaming more often. So I think that having the opportunity
[3317.21s -> 3325.05s]  to just kind of plan each week, because then it's like, oh, okay, so here's what's
[3325.05s -> 3327.53s]  gonna happen. I'm gonna do this on Monday, Tuesday, and then like Thursday, Friday.
[3328.73s -> 3334.55s]  Maybe I'll just stay with it for a while. I think the start time will always be the same.
[3334.55s -> 3342.63s]  It'll always be somewhere around 3 p.m. Pacific, between like 2 to 3 p.m., 3-ish p.m. Pacific.
[3343.35s -> 3353.66s]  But I'm not sure. I think when I have a schedule, I've talked about schedules before
[3353.66s -> 3360.50s]  and it's great and it helps, but I feel like I've been streaming more often because
[3360.50s -> 3366.18s]  when I have a schedule, oh, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, that's it. That's when I stream.
[3366.18s -> 3371.85s]  Just Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. That's when I'm live. I'm not live. I don't do anything else.
[3371.85s -> 3374.33s]  Having no schedule allows me to kind of just do what I want and sometimes that
[3374.33s -> 3380.20s]  even means streaming four or five days a week. I don't know. I haven't come to
[3380.20s -> 3383.32s]  a conclusion yet, but for now I'm still going to be schedule-less for now.
[3389.11s -> 3392.95s]  But let's do the bits. Thanks for sticking around. I'll see you hopefully on
[3393.75s -> 3400.74s]  Friday for Jackbox 5 and then hope to see you again this weekend.
[3403.64s -> 3408.36s]  I'm going to take the offline screen down, but I got to change it before I do that because
[3408.36s -> 3412.10s]  I don't want it to just be like a default thing. I got to have that ready. It's going
[3412.10s -> 3422.01s]  to go and just edit it. But let's start back six plus hours ago here. Shrapnel or Shcrapnel,
[3422.01s -> 3428.23s]  thanks for the $1. Thanks also to Mostly Lost for the $1. Jerma, if all you did for the
[3428.23s -> 3432.63s]  rest of your career was just stream character creation sequences, I'd be perfectly happy.
[3432.63s -> 3441.16s]  I do love creating characters. It is a lot of fun. It is one of my favorite things,
[3442.81s -> 3450.47s]  but thank you. Thank you to Divus P for the three bucks coming in with a three spot.
[3450.47s -> 3458.89s]  Seems like Divus comes in every single stream with $3. Thank you for the $3. Thank you for
[3458.89s -> 3463.61s]  consistent $3 pretty much every stream and more than that. You've given way more than
[3463.61s -> 3475.18s]  that on some streams. Thank you. That's my go-to number. Thanks. Extra Cheesy, thanks
[3475.18s -> 3485.90s]  for the $1. Congrats. You made a Neanderthal cowboy. No, it's the Muppet from the taxicab,
[3485.90s -> 3493.30s]  but thanks a lot. Extra Cheesy for the $1. Lightning Rider had five community subs.
[3493.30s -> 3504.54s]  Thank you Lightning Rider. Lots of subscriptions and congratulations to the people that got those
[3504.62s -> 3513.18s]  subscriptions. Yen Wen, thank you Yen Wen. Yen Wenlin for the $1. I've been enjoying your red
[3513.18s -> 3517.82s]  dead streams, especially the two and a half hour death train bit you did. I decided to
[3517.82s -> 3523.26s]  draw a picture of you and Francis the Fox. You technically owe me like $200 now, but I'll
[3523.26s -> 3528.92s]  let it slide. Wait, what? This image is for you only. You can show chat, but please don't
[3528.92s -> 3546.28s]  share the link. Okay, this is for me only. The death train was a lot of fun. This image
[3546.28s -> 3567.24s]  is for you only. Private image. I'm going to screen cap it. He said you can show chat.
[3569.91s -> 3580.57s]  Here. No, that's, oh my God. That is, that is so detailed. All right. I'm going to have to,
[3580.57s -> 3601.22s]  I have to show this on stream. That's absolutely amazing. Let me pull it out here.
[3602.10s -> 3618.34s]  You got to look at this shit guys. Oh my God. I feel like I need to hang this in my
[3618.34s -> 3652.30s]  living room. That has to go over a mantle. Wow. Nice fucking job hanging in the living room.
[3655.38s -> 3658.02s]  I'm going to like just have a, I'm going to have a copy of that. It's going to be sitting
[3658.02s -> 3668.92s]  right here on my desk. But thank you. That's Yen Wen Lin. Yen Wen Lin for your incredibly
[3668.92s -> 3676.70s]  amazing piece of artwork. Thank you. That's for me only. That's for me only though.
[3676.70s -> 3690.82s]  Nobody else. Right onto the fridge. In every room. Hey, Dr. Clay, thanks for the one dollar.
[3690.82s -> 3706.23s]  Just keep it up. Yeah, let's go. I'm just going to keep it like over here. It's my new wallpaper.
[3706.95s -> 3710.95s]  Thank you, Dr. Clay for the one dollar. The guy who helped you with the muppet taxi thing
[3710.95s -> 3727.40s]  was Dragon Breath. Here's proof. We got time stamp. We got proof. Thank you. Thank
[3727.40s -> 3734.01s]  you for the help. Oh, that's me. Thank you, Dr. Clay. Thank you extra cheesy for the one
[3734.01s -> 3743.08s]  dollar. I don't need to understand. I just need to do. Jerma the Philosopher 2018. That's
[3743.08s -> 3748.30s]  accurate. Thank you extra cheesy again for the one dollar. You should make another character
[3748.30s -> 3756.46s]  that looks like a hipster and roleplay him as a time traveler. Why would I do that? Thank you
[3756.46s -> 3763.70s]  to Mulu Mulum for the one dollar. I love you, Jerma boy. You're the best fluffy Garfield
[3763.70s -> 3772.70s]  kitty. Thanks for the one dollar Mulum or Mullium. Renegade Panther. Thanks for the 15 dollars.
[3773.18s -> 3788.26s]  15 bucks from Renegade Panther. They say hey hey Jerma. 69. That's it. Thanks for the 15 dollars
[3788.26s -> 3801.78s]  Renegade. Appreciate it. 15 bucks. Got him. Hey WildFox. Thanks for the one dollar WildFox 73.
[3801.78s -> 3806.87s]  WildFox 173. Jerma currently watching my way through the VODs again and I'm super thankful
[3806.87s -> 3810.71s]  for your regular streaming. Since I can't work in winter as a landscaper, I have tons of
[3810.71s -> 3815.67s]  free time. I've been playing Fallout straight for longer than is probably good for me. What
[3815.75s -> 3821.46s]  are some good games you got obsessed with and fell in love with? There are a couple of very obvious
[3821.46s -> 3830.47s]  answers here. There's Diablo 2 is one of my favorite games. I have thousands of hours in
[3830.47s -> 3837.24s]  that game. Binding of Isaac is another one. If you just want to just fall into a video game
[3837.24s -> 3841.24s]  and just keep doing run after run and it's just something you always play, Binding of Isaac
[3841.24s -> 3847.42s]  is probably the best one I would say in this current kind of generation. I'd also tell you
[3847.42s -> 3855.22s]  to play Team Fortress 2. Maybe if you asked this two or three years ago, maybe I'd say that.
[3855.22s -> 3861.06s]  I just don't know what the state of the game is really at all. But if you've never played TF2
[3861.06s -> 3874.17s]  before, it's kind of just opening up an entire world of fun shit to do. Diablo 2,
[3874.17s -> 3885.58s]  he's a boomer. Diablo 2 is so good. It is so much fun. It's just the best, but it's just
