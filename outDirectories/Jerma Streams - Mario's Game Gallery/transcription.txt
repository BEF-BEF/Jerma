[5.56s -> 27.80s]  Mario Yahtzee Rematch. How do you spell yahtzee? Is it like- it's like ya- yahtzee? Yahtzee?
[28.60s -> 43.29s]  All right, I'm gonna do- Mario Yahtzee. Mario Yahtzee Rematch. All right, hey!
[44.47s -> 48.90s]  I know exactly where that is. I can get it right now. Isn't that interesting?
[50.41s -> 58.54s]  Mario Game Gallery. You didn't- you thought this was gonna take a while. Oh, BRB guys,
[58.54s -> 101.99s]  I gotta like set this shit up. Nope, nope, nope. Turn the PS4 off. Get this on the screen. Hey,
[101.99s -> 105.43s]  you thought it was gonna take more than five seconds. Welcome to Mario Yahtzee.
[106.31s -> 119.32s]  Wait, hold on. Best out of three. See if I can beat Mario again at his own game. Dude,
[119.32s -> 123.78s]  talk to Transformer after this. Uh, if we still have some time, I'll do it. Maybe we'll do that
[123.78s -> 139.58s]  tomorrow. That's something we could do tomorrow. All right, Yahtzee. No, no, no, no, Yahtzee. No,
[139.58s -> 154.50s]  no, I wanna play- what are you doing? All right, here we go. It's like I never left.
[158.23s -> 167.94s]  He's gonna get straight here. Gonna get a big straight. Don't you start it off with a big straight.
[173.06s -> 182.90s]  That's all right. Wait, he left? Did I fall asleep? Yeah, I mean, it's a- it's a generic
[182.90s -> 190.20s]  kind of open world kill zombies game. Not a whole lot of freedom with the car, not a whole lot of
[190.20s -> 197.26s]  freedom with the environments, but you know, it's still- it was all right. It was all right. Look,
[197.26s -> 203.32s]  okay, I didn't get like food poisoning from eating at that restaurant. I didn't really like eating
[203.32s -> 216.54s]  there, but I- I'm gonna be all right. Ooh, all right, so we got one, three, three. I'm thinking
[216.54s -> 223.18s]  we do one, two, three, four. Oh, let's- let's go for it. We need a two? No, we don't. We need a- no,
[223.18s -> 239.98s]  hold the threes. Don't be nice anymore. The days gone devs aren't here anymore. It's all right.
[240.54s -> 257.30s]  Let's just pick the one. Okay, it's my turn now. It's the best- it's the best out of three, guys.
[257.30s -> 270.18s]  We got plenty of opportunity. Oh god damn it. Full house and a small straight immediately.
[275.61s -> 283.58s]  Come on. I think I just take the small straight here. I mean, he- the- I- it's- I'm- that's what
[283.58s -> 295.46s]  I'm gonna do. I'm just taking the straight. 48 points to one. Go for the- yeah, go for the big one.
[296.02s -> 319.54s]  Three, four, five, let's go. Two, give me a two. It's not a two. I really enjoy playing with you.
[320.50s -> 332.62s]  Yo, go fish. Go back to days gone. You don't get to have it both ways, okay guys?
[337.24s -> 342.28s]  I ain't gonna get like bullied out of days gone to do the thing that everyone wanted to then be like
[342.28s -> 355.74s]  wait, wait, wait. Can you go back to days gone? That was fun. Play both at the same time. I can't
[355.74s -> 365.43s]  do that. Okay, so we're gonna go with fives here. We could do two, three, four, five. I mean, we
[365.43s -> 378.34s]  could go- we could try for a big straight. Just need a six or a one. Give it to me.
[387.18s -> 399.30s]  It's gonna have to be choice. Damn it. Choice or twos?
[402.34s -> 415.94s]  It's gonna have to be twos. Damn it. Damn it. It's all right. Oh, he- he can win one.
[415.94s -> 438.60s]  He won't win this though. But he has nothing on fives. I mean, this is not bad. This is not a
[438.60s -> 445.37s]  bad a thing. I just need to get- I gotta get some good sixes, fives, and fours, and I'll be good to
[445.37s -> 466.23s]  go. This is bad. Hold the three and roll everything else. It's just- it's bad. Bad. A full house though.
[466.23s -> 476.98s]  I mean, I- a full house with these is so bad. This is gonna be- how many points is that gonna be?
[476.98s -> 482.07s]  That's not- that's a waste. Yeah, I'm not gonna do that. I'm just gonna hold- I'm holding the three
[482.07s -> 503.43s]  and just roll it. Oh, come on. I wish I didn't do the aces before. No, I'm not gonna forfeit.
[503.43s -> 512.17s]  This is still a winnable game. I- I- all right. I- I'll take this terrible roll. It's fine.
[518.76s -> 526.82s]  It is still winnable. Look at all the options I have. What's he gonna- what's he gonna- four of
[526.82s -> 533.18s]  a kind. If he gets- this is gonna be hard to do if he gets this. Four of a kind is- will make this
[533.18s -> 556.49s]  very hard to win. Or he might just get a Yahtzee. Not the worst possible scenario. Why are you
[556.49s -> 563.74s]  giving this to me now? I just had to- I keep getting him the turn after the first- I mean,
[563.74s -> 573.80s]  go for a full house. Just try to get a four. This is the best I'm gonna get. Or roll the four. Or
[573.80s -> 587.13s]  go for four of a kind. I'm not gonna get it though. Try it. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Give me
[587.13s -> 615.88s]  the Yahtzee. And I'm back in the game. Do it. Back in the game. Back in it. Now we have a chance
[615.88s -> 625.00s]  to win. Although that kind of sucks that he got that. That actually- that really sucks.
[625.00s -> 637.88s]  Because now I have- I have to get a big straight. Or- I wonder if I hold the four.
[639.74s -> 657.32s]  Hold the four and try four to hold the six. Let's try fours. Four, four, four, four. I would have
[657.32s -> 674.68s]  got a six too. Shit. I might throw this on choice. This is dog shit. I might- I- 20, that's not bad.
[674.68s -> 679.26s]  This- these are both not good enough. I'm just gonna do choice. 20 points for choice. That's not
[679.26s -> 695.53s]  terrible. That's pretty good. As long as you- if you get more than 19 points. If you get 20 or more
[695.53s -> 702.54s]  for choice, that's fine. That's a good roll. Does he go- what is he going for? Four of a kind of ones?
[705.40s -> 719.72s]  Oh fuck you. I think this is unwinnable. This is a- it's gonna be close. I need a straight. I need a
[719.72s -> 725.08s]  big straight. Or you know what? I'll take a goddamn- what- okay hold on a minute here. What happens if
[725.08s -> 736.22s]  you get a Yahtzee again? Is it- is it just a four of a kind always? Or will I get more points? Like
[736.78s -> 754.23s]  I can get five fives, right? I'd- oh. Is it worth- is it worth doing the fives or is it worth taking
[754.23s -> 765.10s]  the four of a kind? It's the four of a kind definitely. Unless I get five here. Well,
[765.10s -> 782.66s]  four of a kind. Why don't- those go- the points went up. I went by- up by two points? Yeah.
[784.74s -> 787.06s]  What is Otto doing out there? I can hear Otto like-
[790.58s -> 793.30s]  Let's go for four of a kind. This is gonna be- if he gets it though,
[794.94s -> 802.14s]  um, after this game, um, he's just being like a weirdo out there. He's just going like, hey!
[802.78s -> 831.05s]  Mario's gonna put this on the aces line. That's fine. Okie dokie. Your move. My Mia. My Mia.
[832.09s -> 855.00s]  Hey, what's it take so long? My Mia. Yeah, he's just being like a little weirdo.
[856.76s -> 864.25s]  He's just like rolling around being like- okay. Mario, let's go. He did it on the- on the ones.
[864.89s -> 879.75s]  All right, so we can do fours or fives. Let's go with fours. No, full house is not. Let's go
[879.75s -> 892.73s]  just roll fours see if I can get some good ones. One, two, three, four. Ah, but one, two, three,
[892.73s -> 908.92s]  four. Everyone- it didn't- don't people get mad at me when I do this? Come on. This is the only way
[908.92s -> 930.17s]  I can win, right? Two. Is that a good game? That actually might be over. I even got a Yahtzee too
[930.17s -> 935.77s]  and he came with all one Yahtzee. That shouldn't even count. It should be like 25 points for that.
[936.65s -> 940.55s]  He's gonna get five. Four of a kind here. This game over.
[954.55s -> 960.79s]  I mean, I- if I get five sixes, maybe? Is this still possible? Or is this actually unwinnable?
[964.34s -> 969.66s]  It's definitely unwinnable. I'm gonna try it though. Well, I might as well just do the five first.
[979.93s -> 994.14s]  Roll for the straight. I- I- I can't. That's the best full house I'm gonna get. Wait! Wait! Don't!
[994.14s -> 1011.58s]  Wait! He's playing Yahtzee again. It's fun. It is. He would have to get no more sixes. It's- I mean,
[1011.58s -> 1017.02s]  he might roll the- yeah. Just get one six. Just completely screw him over here. Okay.
[1017.02s -> 1041.85s]  Okay? The threes? Oh, all right. He just threw that one in the garbage. Why? Why? Five sixes
[1041.85s -> 1053.72s]  are straight. I- there's no fives or sixes here. Well, there's the fives. Here's the opportunity.
[1054.52s -> 1060.76s]  One, two, three, four. No. Just give me some more fives.
[1061.08s -> 1069.66s]  Hmm. Might as well go out with dignity, right?
[1073.58s -> 1084.36s]  Shut up! I'm just- I'm sorry. You sound so defeated.
[1086.28s -> 1099.06s]  I care more about Mario Yahtzee than I do about Days Gone. Oh, god damn it. This is over. So does
[1099.06s -> 1116.04s]  everybody else. Play it out. Sixes. We can't do a straight. I could have used
[1116.76s -> 1127.91s]  so long ago. Come on. Fill it up with sixes. At least give me something cool.
[1133.48s -> 1139.75s]  Unwinnable. Wait. Oh, 20- 30 points, right? Yeah. Unwinnable. Game over.
[1151.85s -> 1155.85s]  You never defeat Mario? I defeated him last time. I beat him at best two out of three.
[1156.33s -> 1169.66s]  Mario's gonna put this on the sixes line. I beat him at Go Fish. I beat him at Yahtzee.
[1169.66s -> 1183.99s]  He beat me in checkers. I'm not done. We're going again. I'm just gonna go for the straight.
[1190.39s -> 1196.66s]  Okay, give me- give me. That's it. I got it. I'm gonna really enjoy playing with you.
[1197.30s -> 1203.70s]  I got a better score this time. I win. How about another game with me?
[1205.96s -> 1213.78s]  Yeah. All right. That's- first game goes to Mario. Second game is gonna come back to the hometown,
[1213.78s -> 1222.26s]  to me. I'm playing on my home turf now. We're in a stadium with 40,000 people watching us play
[1222.26s -> 1240.63s]  Yahtzee. He's gonna start off strong here. Oh, fuck. This is bad. I think a little is a big one.
[1242.87s -> 1255.35s]  Little straight. All right, my turn. Yahtzee right off the bat. One,
[1255.91s -> 1264.68s]  two, three. I can get- I just needed two. I need a four. This is not gonna work. Let's just go with
[1264.68s -> 1293.69s]  the ones. It's all right. It's not a bad aces. Please use this emote. It feels useless.
[1294.41s -> 1305.14s]  Well, don't say that. What's he trying to do? Why is he holding the two ones?
[1305.78s -> 1313.38s]  Hmm. Mario's gonna put these on the aces line. Why wouldn't you just roll for the ones?
[1313.38s -> 1344.70s]  Your roll. Well, I already have the straight. Let's go for the big one. Five. Five. No.
[1347.06s -> 1359.37s]  It's my turn now. What can we expect as an eSports? The Mario eSports Yahtzee?
[1367.08s -> 1372.87s]  Don't do it. That's going on the aces line. Yeah. You're gonna take a shitty two.
[1373.51s -> 1390.15s]  It's your turn. Ooh. Okay. Now we've got an opportunity here. I'm going for straight up
[1390.15s -> 1407.45s]  sixes. Give me some sixes. Hmm. I can still do choice even if it's not good. Give me at least
[1407.45s -> 1415.54s]  one more. Come on. Six. All right. All right. So, all right. Hold on a second here though.
[1417.14s -> 1421.83s]  Do I take the full house with the one and the six or do I just take the sixes? Or do I take
[1421.83s -> 1441.64s]  it as a choice? Because that's like bad and good. Sixes. We might not get this again. Oh, brother.
[1441.64s -> 1456.09s]  We might not see that again. This guy stinks. That's gonna be the move that wins me the
[1456.09s -> 1467.26s]  championship. Just watch. Here comes the Yahtzee. Mario's gonna put these on the four of the kind
[1467.26s -> 1487.96s]  line. Your roll. That's all right. I'll take that. Tie game. Roll the fours or roll the, yeah. Yeah.
[1488.92s -> 1508.70s]  Roll the fours. I just, I mean, I could go for the, I could, I could do it. I could go for it.
[1509.58s -> 1528.44s]  I could go for it. I just need a five. Sometimes you gotta fucking do it.
[1539.93s -> 1556.79s]  Nineteen's not bad choice. It's fine. Twenty points is fine. Spirit broken. Oh, I'm good.
[1562.74s -> 1564.90s]  That's not even that good. Three is not even that good.
[1565.78s -> 1588.15s]  Big straight four of the kind. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five. Give me a two.
[1589.03s -> 1626.87s]  Give me a two. Two. Yeah. Big hit. Big win. Big hand. It's my turn now. Big win. I just
[1626.87s -> 1639.24s]  pulled ahead by a lot here. On for the Yahtzee. Got it. Oh, fuck you. Mario's gonna put these
[1639.24s -> 1645.26s]  on the Yahtzee line. Oh, well. Unbelievable. Whatever. I can still win. Your move.
[1645.82s -> 1651.54s]  I have to get a Yahtzee. We gotta make it happen. We gotta go for big odds here. Big Vegas odds.
[1670.09s -> 1678.84s]  Come on. Give me at least another three. Give me four of a kind. Well, give me a Yahtzee right
[1678.84s -> 1697.38s]  here. Oh, well. I'm gonna really enjoy playing with you. You're gonna get a big straight.
[1697.94s -> 1705.62s]  Oh, no. He'll get such good points here. Let's see. No. Dates are going on the big straight
[1706.50s -> 1728.92s]  line. I have to get a Yahtzee. Your move. I have to get a Yahtzee. I have to. Come on. All right.
[1728.92s -> 1733.96s]  All right. All right. All right. Here we go. This is my chance. And then it's a game again.
[1734.52s -> 1752.73s]  We have a one in six chance to get this. It's very doable. It is. Four. That four of a kind is
[1752.73s -> 1774.31s]  better too. Four is a four of a kind. Probably four of a kind. I don't know because he's got that
[1774.31s -> 1783.27s]  two-point differential. I might not get another four of a kind. I might not get another four of a
[1783.27s -> 1803.99s]  kind. Oh, you're so good. What are you? Full house. That's not it. No, I don't. My god. Mario's gonna
[1803.99s -> 1826.68s]  put this on the full house line. Your roll. I could go for the four of a kind with the ones
[1827.66s -> 1844.68s]  or roll the five. No two? I don't even have a two. Do I just roll the two? Do I salvage this and roll
[1844.68s -> 1850.22s]  the two or do I keep the fives and try to port? Oh, I don't know. I might just roll the two.
[1856.34s -> 1874.79s]  I should have rolled the fucking two. He's gonna win again. No. Then we're gonna be tied up. I
[1874.79s -> 1882.76s]  won a series and then he won a series. We have to do another one. It wouldn't help. Eh.
[1900.73s -> 1913.78s]  Is this still winnable? If I get a Yahtzee, it may be. Oh, there are the twos. Two.
[1914.74s -> 1940.28s]  Oh, yeah. Here comes the Yahtzee. Yahtzee. Ready? Are you ready? Here it comes. The game's not even
[1940.28s -> 1954.44s]  fun. Oh, you're so good. I don't know why people play this. I got it. Go back to Days Gone. No,
[1955.80s -> 1966.30s]  we're done with that one. Let's see. Mario Yahtzee is the Days Gone of Yahtzee games.
[1966.78s -> 1975.16s]  Mario's gonna put this on the choice line. Yeah, we're getting destroyed. Okie dokie.
[1975.16s -> 1983.32s]  Your move. I mean, if I can get a four of a kind with sixes or I just need sixes all across the
[1983.32s -> 1989.69s]  board. That's not it. I gotta go for the Yahtzee. I have to go for the four of a kind. I have to go
[1989.69s -> 1999.99s]  for the four of a kind. I have to. If I do the six, then I have to try. That's the only way I'm
[1999.99s -> 2005.74s]  gonna be able to try to get a Yahtzee. But the sixes, well, it's not gonna happen. I'm so
[2005.74s -> 2024.04s]  unlucky. Look what happened. And now I have to take the dumb crappy six. Look what happened.
[2029.46s -> 2045.80s]  The game is unwinnable. If he gets another six, it's over. I mean, I think it already is unwinnable.
[2055.10s -> 2061.10s]  I think that puts it out of reach completely. Yeah, it's impossible. I would need four sixes
[2061.10s -> 2067.54s]  and then a Yahtzee, but I don't think that's even gonna do it. Holy shit. And when you pray,
[2068.74s -> 2074.87s]  you get it. You just, when you pray for it, sometimes it happens. Four of a kind with six.
[2078.78s -> 2084.78s]  Oh, come on. Do it. Just do it. Do it so I can win. Just do it so I can win. I'm not even gonna
[2084.78s -> 2102.79s]  give you a small victory here. Not even gonna give you a small victory. That's it. Here's fives.
[2102.79s -> 2111.29s]  Yeah. Oh, Mario rolled five of a kind. I'm gonna roll these ones again.
[2112.01s -> 2119.66s]  Well, he wins the series. That's two out of three. He wins. He wins the series. Mario's gonna put
[2119.66s -> 2127.43s]  these on the fives line. So this next series of games, this is the world championship coming up
[2127.43s -> 2135.11s]  here. It's the best of three series. I said three out of five. Well, I won two out of three last
[2135.19s -> 2140.01s]  time and this is two out of three here this time. None of this even matters.
[2140.89s -> 2158.50s]  Just give me the... It doesn't even matter. I lose. Like, who cares? Okay. Thank you so much.
[2158.50s -> 2167.93s]  Nice game. Hey, how about another game with me? Yeah, I'll do another one. Here we go. This is
[2167.93s -> 2174.25s]  the start of the new series. Game one of the world series and we're playing best of three.
[2176.06s -> 2178.94s]  Good luck. Yeah, I got crushed two times in a row.
[2184.60s -> 2192.39s]  You're addicted. Do you get addicted to this game? Do they have new versions of this? Actual...
[2193.91s -> 2197.51s]  This is definitely not an iPad. This is some shitty iPad game I can play.
[2200.82s -> 2203.30s]  I can't wait to get the Yahtzee for iPad and play it in bed.
[2204.70s -> 2213.77s]  That's a good four of a kind. 14 points? I wouldn't have done that.
[2219.22s -> 2246.41s]  Well, got the straight already. Go for the big one. Let's go. Damn it. Two. Ah.
[2252.44s -> 2255.08s]  You're playing at a huge table? No, we're playing... We're lying in the grass.
[2259.26s -> 2260.46s]  We're in Mario's backyard.
[2277.46s -> 2283.19s]  That's good. That's very good. Four.
[2285.27s -> 2303.86s]  Okay, I'm ready. One, two, three. I could go for the big again. I'm going for it.
[2305.90s -> 2316.71s]  Big straight. Give me a five. Come on. Ah, come on. Don't make me pick a shitty choice here. Do it.
[2324.06s -> 2333.02s]  Game one's in my pocket. It's already here. See, right now Mario is internally
[2334.60s -> 2341.21s]  infuriated by what just happened there. Ah, it feels great. Why can't I play? Why can't you
[2341.21s -> 2347.13s]  play this at the casino? Okay, somebody look it up. Are there any Yahtzee tables in Las Vegas?
[2347.69s -> 2358.39s]  Can I play Yahtzee at the casino? I got it. That's going on the little straight line. Your role.
[2359.03s -> 2374.81s]  There is no house edge. Yeah, but he got a small straight. There is Yahtzee in Las Vegas.
[2376.06s -> 2385.53s]  That's all I needed to hear. Okay, so we can do... Let's grab the sixes. Let's go for a big six.
[2386.17s -> 2396.26s]  I can't wait to play. Are you telling me there's really this Yahtzee in Vegas?
[2396.98s -> 2424.82s]  Holy shit, I'm doing it. Damn. Ah, choice. They get twice as many roles for house advantage.
[2427.22s -> 2437.13s]  Look at all the practice I'm getting. Yeah, playing against Mario. I've been in Vegas for about
[2437.13s -> 2440.22s]  like seven or so months. Seven and a half months, something like that.
[2440.38s -> 2446.44s]  Hmm. Mario's gonna put this on the full house. That's a hell of an advantage.
[2448.20s -> 2456.10s]  We get to roll twice. That's bullshit. I would never play that. I would rather eat my money than do
[2456.10s -> 2473.05s]  that. So what are we looking for here? We're looking for threes. Let's see if we can't pull
[2473.05s -> 2493.51s]  something out here with threes. I'm switching it to the ones. There you go. See, that's the kind
[2493.51s -> 2496.31s]  of play I would do at the table. And everyone would be like, a guy with a cigar in his mouth
[2496.31s -> 2511.85s]  would turn and be like, holy shit, this guy knows what he's doing. He gets it every time first.
[2512.57s -> 2525.88s]  This is the third game in a row he would get it. Thank God. Yeah, I am drinking pineapple juice.
[2525.88s -> 2536.97s]  How could you tell? Did anybody even say that? Did they make that up? Am I arguing in my own
[2536.97s -> 2548.62s]  head again? All right, let's get some fives. Or four of a kind would be great. Bingo. Yahtzee.
[2550.46s -> 2561.38s]  Do it. Do it. And win. Do it and win. Do it and win. Do it and win. Awww. Pineapple juice is
[2561.38s -> 2579.16s]  gonna melt your stomach. I'll be fine. I'll be all right. It's very pineapple-y. That's the best
[2579.16s -> 2587.90s]  four of a kind I'll ever get. Unless it was a six, but didn't have any sixes. Let us play with
[2587.98s -> 2592.46s]  smart click. Now that would take forever. Uh oh. This is bad.
[2600.18s -> 2610.18s]  What do you get for the- do you get 22 points? Mario only enjoys playing with you when he's
[2610.18s -> 2619.98s]  winning. Well, I can do fives. I can also try for the two- I could do full house, a terrible
[2619.98s -> 2636.58s]  full house, but it's still a full house. I'm doing it. Oh, that sucks. That's so bad. That's
[2636.58s -> 2662.60s]  terrible. 13 points? Why did I do this? That's so bad. No, I'm taking it.
[2668.30s -> 2672.22s]  If I got two fives there, that would've been so- that would've been worse than a full house there.
[2680.81s -> 2684.97s]  This is the part where the guy with the cigar puts it back in his mouth and shakes his head and looks
[2684.97s -> 2697.16s]  away. Yeah, I thought I could trust you, kid. That's when the guy grabs, he like smears his
[2697.16s -> 2704.70s]  hand on the table with the four grand and chips into his lap. I'm going to another fucking table.
[2704.70s -> 2713.58s]  This guy's an idiot. And then I have a conversation with the dealer. Oh yeah, I'm on like vacation
[2714.06s -> 2716.78s]  with me, my family. Mario, I'm trying to tell a joke.
[2729.08s -> 2747.14s]  Bingo. Bang. Ah, do it. It's a good move. It's my turn now. I really do have this in Vegas.
[2748.26s -> 2753.62s]  I'm going to go start smoking cigars and just sit there and play all day for like 25 cents a hand.
[2754.42s -> 2759.58s]  I'm going to roll these ones again.
[2760.70s -> 2761.90s]  Yahtzee again.
[2766.63s -> 2780.66s]  Mario's going to put this on the sixes line. Your roll. What's the matter? What? What do you need?
[2781.46s -> 2787.38s]  He's looking at me like, hey. He's like, don't smoke. Don't do that. Mama mia.
[2788.55s -> 2795.13s]  Otto. What's the matter? What do you need? He's just like kind of staring at me like, hey.
[2796.79s -> 2803.06s]  Do you need to go outside? You want to go outside? I think you might need to go out.
[2803.06s -> 2805.62s]  You need to go outside? Is that what your problem is? Is that your problem?
[2806.42s -> 2813.29s]  What's the emergency? Emergency. I have to go outside. Mario, deal with it. I'm talking to my
[2813.29s -> 2822.12s]  dog. Show us the dog. I can't. I'm dressed like an asshole. I can't. Let me, I got to take him out.
[2822.12s -> 2827.72s]  I think he must have gone outside. So give me, give me like a minute or two. I know I'm stopping
[2827.72s -> 2839.58s]  like I'm getting off the table mid game. Hold on. Yeah, I'll be back. Just like hold my place.
[2839.58s -> 2849.98s]  Hold my place. I'll be right back. He's so angry. All right, beer beat.
[2950.50s -> 2993.14s]  Take it so long. Hey, what's it take so long? Hey, what's it take so long?
[3002.70s -> 3021.40s]  Mama mia. Knock it off. Pizza. Pizza the heck out of me.
[3031.51s -> 3043.67s]  Mama mia. Hey, what's it take so long?
[3044.23s -> 3072.89s]  Who's there? Who? You're making me cuckoo crazy. Okay. Hi, Mario. This is scary. Well, I had an
[3072.89s -> 3080.41s]  extra pair of dice that was under my sleeve at Mario's casino. They dragged me. They got out of
[3080.41s -> 3088.86s]  the back. All right, here we go. What's happening in the background? You made this to like an hour
[3088.86s -> 3102.70s]  ago. Get back to. Yeah, that was from like an hour ago. All right, here we go. I'm back at the table.
[3104.36s -> 3121.72s]  Hi Mario. All right, here we go. I'm gonna win this one. Bingo. Three threes. Yeah, Otto had to pee.
[3123.62s -> 3131.11s]  He had to pee real bad actually. He was like oh god. He just peed for like 25
[3132.25s -> 3140.46s]  seconds. That was, now that's way too long. Maybe like four or five. It was definitely not 25
[3140.46s -> 3153.51s]  seconds. Into a bottle and he was in the passenger seat. Come on. Another three. It's all right.
[3153.51s -> 3164.98s]  Whatever. Why would you count? I'm just not going one, two, three, four. Wow, that's a long one.
[3168.94s -> 3182.09s]  Does he have a uh a win condition here? If I get. No, he does. Still a game. That's going on the
[3182.09s -> 3195.00s]  fours line. I can live with that. That's all right. Okey dokey. Your move. He's building his late game.
[3195.08s -> 3203.58s]  He's trying to. Too bad. This would have been an amazing full house. Sixes of five. They're
[3203.58s -> 3226.49s]  gonna do the sixes. Let's go for it. Do it. One more. Well, that's unfortunate. Oh brother.
[3226.49s -> 3240.04s]  It's okay though. Were you playing that back to work clip while you were away? Yeah. What's he
[3240.04s -> 3245.64s]  going for? He already has his sixes. What are you trying to do? These ones again. You trying to get
[3245.64s -> 3253.18s]  a yahtzee? Why would you go? I got it. What are you gonna put this on? Mario's gonna put this
[3253.18s -> 3261.16s]  on the deuces line. Why would you do that? Okey dokey. Your move. He just blew the whole game.
[3261.88s -> 3273.58s]  He actually, I think, just blew it. Oh all right. Well, whatever Mario. It's not my role. I'm not
[3273.58s -> 3291.56s]  gonna tell you how to do it. Way to go. It's my turn now. He has to get a straight or a yahtzee.
[3291.56s -> 3309.54s]  It's not gonna happen. These ones again. No, no. The game's over. This is game over. I'm gonna roll
[3309.54s -> 3319.29s]  these ones again. It's the hardest thing to get in the whole game. That's going on the big straight.
[3319.29s -> 3325.91s]  Holy shit. He got it. Oh that's bad. Oh no. Your role. Oh he didn't. Okay, I've, for a second,
[3326.47s -> 3331.91s]  I looked down and like scratched my nose and I heard, that's going on the big straight.
[3331.91s -> 3351.69s]  I was like, oh there, he got it. Uh fives. Let me put this game away.
[3364.36s -> 3376.23s]  So he can still win if he gets a yahtzee. He needs, no, he's gonna... don't get a yahtzee. That's not
[3376.23s -> 3401.78s]  good oh god don't get a six game over that was that was scary see if I can get
[3401.78s -> 3419.45s]  it I'll try Mario I'm trying to roll man no don't matter one more if I win the
[3419.45s -> 3429.05s]  next one then I win the championship against Mario and that's it Mario I'm
[3429.05s -> 3442.06s]  going for it you got to win two more I just have to win this one that's a
[3442.06s -> 3455.84s]  pretty strong start if he gets a full house here that's a strong 28 points
[3455.84s -> 3466.95s]  shit I get it let me answer with something big no that's not what I want
[3466.95s -> 3489.14s]  I don't want to do a full house with one in three he took off the weights I can't
[3489.14s -> 3505.02s]  restart holy shit these huge numbers he's going for straight glad he didn't
[3505.02s -> 3517.69s]  hold the sixes the fives cuz that would have been bad really not hard to get a
[3517.69s -> 3532.21s]  little straight that doesn't concern me that much I should still hmm fives or
[3532.21s -> 3540.45s]  should I go for two three should I go for the big one we'll just do the fives
[3540.45s -> 3575.61s]  it's too risky yeah it is too risky but I'm doing it anyways and go do not
[3575.61s -> 3582.36s]  answer with a big straight no don't do it don't get him one something bad
[3582.36s -> 3596.91s]  something terrible yes that is dog shit good two fives Mario is echoing he's
[3596.91s -> 3609.82s]  echoing what do you mean he's echoing I've also been my audio has been delayed
[3609.82s -> 3615.79s]  this whole time we can hear him through your mic oh it's because the game's
[3615.79s -> 3625.90s]  really loud I was delayed by about a full second so I was probably reacting a
[3625.90s -> 3631.66s]  second later than when things happen I know I get it let's go I get it Mario
[3631.66s -> 3639.63s]  you can hear through your dangling headphone that's so funny it really is
[3639.63s -> 3655.63s]  hanging down right here because my audio was delayed that's great let's go no
[3655.67s -> 3660.10s]  that's not good but it might be all I could get what do you think four and
[3660.10s -> 3673.51s]  three full house better opportunity later I'm gonna go for it or I could go
[3673.51s -> 3690.03s]  for the threes damn it yeah get a little straight two three four let's try to get
[3690.03s -> 3699.49s]  a little straight fuck it's such a ridiculous it's such a high chance to
[3699.49s -> 3714.60s]  get this to I need a two no I need a one or a five don't do this to me thank
[3714.60s -> 3733.46s]  God you got two dice
[3744.85s -> 3752.21s]  it's good he's got really his full house was awesome this four of a kind is
[3752.25s -> 3786.00s]  really good I need a good four of a kind or do I try to get the full house yeah
[3786.00s -> 3798.86s]  come on yahtzee yahtzee it's all right I don't know if I four of a kind that
[3798.86s -> 3807.94s]  though 13 points look at he's got so much I'm just gonna go with threes
[3814.38s -> 3835.74s]  big straight no one two three four oh he's got great rolls here he's had four
[3835.74s -> 3852.41s]  of a kind on his last three turns I think already got the straight this is
[3852.41s -> 3861.48s]  this is just out of the pocket straight to no it's not it is free um I do I do I
[3861.48s -> 3873.08s]  just hold the told the tooth is for a hold the two or just hold I don't really
[3873.08s -> 3878.89s]  want to hold the six hold the five and the six I mean what just try to get a
[3878.89s -> 3892.10s]  better choice trying a big choice yeah I see it yeah it's true oh that's what I
[3892.10s -> 3899.54s]  needed that's exactly what I needed full house sixes and fives I'll take it thank
[3899.54s -> 3920.41s]  you I felt good yeah hold the five that was I wasn't gonna do that I was gonna
[3920.41s -> 3923.25s]  hold the twos and try to get some you know trying to essentially throw the
[3923.25s -> 3962.42s]  hand away still either one of us can win not a bad choice still do fours that's
[3962.42s -> 3973.58s]  also not a bad choice I wonder if I just roll the three and do choice that's what
[3973.58s -> 3983.20s]  I'm gonna do or roll the fours or all the sixes yes no yes no no no yes no yes
[3983.20s -> 3993.02s]  no why just go before no no yes either hold the force of hold the sixes I
[3993.02s -> 4025.23s]  should have just held that thing that I was doing and everybody yelled at me
[4025.23s -> 4032.80s]  because that mad because bad mad because I'm gonna do what I want now if I have a
[4032.80s -> 4035.64s]  question I'm gonna ask it out loud and I'm gonna cover the screen and I'm not
[4035.64s -> 4056.57s]  gonna look what is that gonna be 21 if he wins by two points I'll be very upset
[4056.57s -> 4098.69s]  don't put the twos to not good at all I hate when you start with two or three
[4098.69s -> 4120.24s]  sixes don't get four sixes I need to get that he just has a good just he's got
[4120.24s -> 4124.60s]  great points not perfect points he's just got great points for everything
[4124.60s -> 4137.17s]  that imagine that was just six six six six well here's my opportunity my turn
[4137.17s -> 4166.89s]  come on don't I'm don't do it yes at least I matched them three three three
[4166.89s -> 4183.82s]  three I need a four of a kind and really anything at this point that's ballsy
[4183.86s -> 4194.28s]  you got fucking kidding me that's a going on the straight line really your
[4194.28s -> 4208.42s]  role give me a break that's as unbelievable I try to get four of a
[4208.42s -> 4213.37s]  kind with the sixes I think I do otherwise within what what's the other
[4213.37s -> 4231.55s]  plate in five I have to go for it oh it's what the sixes do it's with the
[4231.87s -> 4249.36s]  do nice he might just do that right now as well check and watch this here comes
[4249.36s -> 4271.34s]  to Fox not this time that may have just completely screwed any chance he had I
[4271.34s -> 4282.44s]  might win by two or three points right now I get I have to play smart here so
[4282.44s -> 4289.08s]  we're just gonna go fours I'm just going for the fours I'm gonna try to
[4289.08s -> 4296.66s]  get his minute just standard get good gameplay it's that's not good but it's
[4296.66s -> 4305.83s]  all right just whatever it is at least ten points whatever whatever just no
[4305.83s -> 4326.06s]  zeros and I went and hold the threes he's in trouble how is day lol how is
[4326.06s -> 4346.49s]  days gone I'll need to confirm no deny how days gone four of a kind let's go

[5768.57s -> 5772.53s]  may feel like it'll break but it won't take the battery out of the basket and
[5772.53s -> 5775.89s]  unscrew it from the motherboard at the top of the controller there's a thin
[5775.89s -> 5779.69s]  cable plugged in unplug and tuck it back pull the plastic holding the
[5779.69s -> 5784.01s]  motherboard and there are two motors on the plastic with wires soldered on the

[5804.20s -> 5812.46s]  just turn the vibration off in your ps4 settings that's how that that was the

[6135.20s -> 6144.60s]  like forehead up on like the brow bone and I was like 12 oh I'll tell you what
[6144.60s -> 6149.78s]  happened now this is a very short story I was at my friend's house and we were
[6149.78s -> 6154.21s]  outside in the snow without context somebody beat me in the face of the
[6154.21s -> 6157.97s]  shovel right okay so let me give you context so I was at my friend's house
[6157.97s -> 6163.16s]  and we were outside playing in the snow it was snowing out we were probably like
[6163.16s -> 6169.66s]  12 13 years old and he had a little sister and his little sister was in the
[6169.66s -> 6174.60s]  front door of the house we were outside and he had a shovel and he's standing in
[6174.60s -> 6178.22s]  front of the front door maybe yeah maybe five to ten maybe ten feet away from the
[6178.22s -> 6184.28s]  front door and he was taking big huge and this is one of those plow shovels
[6184.28s -> 6188.64s]  the big heavy fucked up ones that you stick on the ground and walk and you
[6188.68s -> 6193.29s]  plow forward right so what he was doing is he was picking up the snow he flipped
[6193.29s -> 6197.35s]  it upside down it was picking snow up with the shovel portion and she was
[6197.35s -> 6202.97s]  opening the door and he was throwing snow at her to try to get into the house
[6202.97s -> 6208.24s]  and hit her with the snow so he's just shoveling throw she was opening through
[6208.24s -> 6211.72s]  a closing the door opening through a closing the door he was just trying to
[6211.72s -> 6217.11s]  throw snow into the house so I was on a sled just sitting behind him and I don't
[6217.11s -> 6220.39s]  know what I don't understand how this happened I really don't know it like my
[6220.39s -> 6224.59s]  memory doesn't form this for some reason but I was sitting down or like
[6224.59s -> 6228.68s]  sledding because he had a staircase a little staircase that was covered in
[6228.68s -> 6232.52s]  snow and I was like kind of going down it and like inching back because he was
[6232.52s -> 6236.97s]  maybe I don't know five feet in front of that so I like sled down it and like
[6236.97s -> 6240.09s]  shimmied my butt forward and I was getting way too close because he wasn't
[6240.09s -> 6243.70s]  paying attention to me so on his backswing he was getting close and I
[6243.70s -> 6249.13s]  guess just stupid 12 year old me did not understand but I just got too close and
[6249.13s -> 6254.67s]  on his big backswing to like throw the snow he hit me right in the fucking face
[6254.67s -> 6260.34s]  right in the eye and busted my forehead under pretty much right where my brow
[6260.34s -> 6266.48s]  bone meets my eye it was just like boom and my face just exploded with blood and

[6513.42s -> 6520.61s]  the Gatorade before you ruined it with your piss always blue or purple any of
[6520.61s -> 6532.92s]  the hot colored Gatorade's by talking orange red any of the you know the sun
[6532.92s -> 6540.30s]  light spectrum any of the heat flavors they're all terrible red just tastes
[6540.30s -> 6545.92s]  like fucking old fruit punch orange tastes like battery acid it just acid
[6545.92s -> 6551.88s]  yellow yellow just tastes like sour patch kids that they grind it up and
[6551.88s -> 6557.74s]  added water to and then drained the water from the sour patch kids mixture
[6557.74s -> 6567.96s]  it's awful blue tastes fresh like the blue tastes like a nice fresh clean
[6567.96s -> 6578.15s]  laundry blueberry and purple is a nice deep deep grape medicine flavor because
[6578.15s -> 6583.20s]  all Gatorade's are disgusting they're all awful and then not you should never
[6583.24s -> 6599.22s]  drink them but you should drink instead is water with just a squeeze just a
[6599.22s -> 6603.15s]  squeeze lemon just squeeze it in there and add like two or three tablespoons of
[6603.15s -> 6612.84s]  salt and like some tomato juice and a celery stock and maybe some maybe some
[6612.84s -> 6619.95s]  maybe some like hot sauce to a little bit of vodka and have a goddamn party
[6619.95s -> 6637.64s]  that's a terrible Bloody Mary now I used to drink Gatorade all the time not
[6637.64s -> 6643.55s]  anymore though I used to be one of those dudes that just on his nightstand was a
[6643.55s -> 6654.99s]  32 ounce Powerade purple and I just slam it right before going to bed back
[6654.99s -> 6659.01s]  when yeah I mean if you okay if you like going to the gym and stuff but I used to
[6659.01s -> 6664.08s]  do it man I used to drink Powerade and Gatorade just as a drink just when I
[6664.08s -> 6670.11s]  wasn't working out you kind of get addicted to them yeah I would do it right
[6670.11s -> 6690.58s]  before bed too how do I still have teeth I don't know I really don't know because
[6690.58s -> 6704.80s]  these are made out of wood listen we're George Washington yeah something we
[6704.80s -> 6712.37s]  have in common but thank you to Jerma lied about where for the 350 Jerma
[6712.37s -> 6716.40s]  pissing into a bottle would be more interesting to be honest Jerma pissing
[6716.40s -> 6719.16s]  into a bottle on camera would get him banned from the platform forever and
[6719.16s -> 6726.11s]  then I would just retire I hope that would be it hey remember the guy that
[6726.11s -> 6733.52s]  retired by peeing into a bottle on stream so no you're probably not gonna
[6733.52s -> 6741.33s]  see that it wouldn't be banned those of you that like oh like oh you're gonna
[6741.33s -> 6749.26s]  get banned because of this no I would I would get retired because of that dude

[6815.58s -> 6826.21s]  annoying lapse in time and you can't compare three minutes of ads to four
[6826.21s -> 6833.52s]  hours of days gone you would rather watch no no no I you'd have to make that
[6833.52s -> 6839.56s]  a little bit harder it would be like 20 minutes of ads versus like would be
[6839.56s -> 6842.84s]  like the equivalent of four hours of days gone no it wouldn't no no no no no
[6842.84s -> 6850.45s]  that's wrong long story short whatever you're speaking for us I'm speaking for

[6961.54s -> 6968.11s]  we already talk about this if okay but like can we read I want to read I want
[6968.11s -> 6971.63s]  to revisit this for a second wait wait wait remember that if you find a
[6971.63s -> 6974.83s]  briefcase on the side of the road with a million dollars cash in it what do you
[6974.83s -> 6982.89s]  do do you turn it in what's the time frame where it's yours everybody thought
[6982.89s -> 6992.02s]  it was crazy when we were talking about this do you return like seven hundred
[6992.02s -> 6997.50s]  and ninety thousand dollars and say I found eight hundred thousand dollars in
[6997.50s -> 7011.15s]  cash on the side of the road you don't know what do you do yeah but how would
[7011.15s -> 7017.35s]  you return it I feel like people have this image in their brain of if you

[7357.36s -> 7361.65s]  years ago I loved all your videos and was sad to see you disappear from the
[7361.65s -> 7365.17s]  main channel didn't realize you swapped to streaming it after I found your
[7365.17s -> 7368.45s]  second channel and I'm so glad I found you again because you always have
[7368.45s -> 7378.28s]  provided the most wholesome enjoyable content much love yeah I I love all the
[7378.32s -> 7385.04s]  time I spent on YouTube it was great it's some of the it's honestly some of
[7385.04s -> 7396.31s]  the most unbelievable years of my life I've ever had not to say that this is
[7396.31s -> 7403.88s]  not the same but I have a ton of incredible memories of making those
[7403.88s -> 7409.40s]  videos more than seven to eight years ago six years ago eight years ago five
[7409.40s -> 7415.64s]  years ago it was it meant everything to me it was my life it still kind of is
[7415.64s -> 7430.39s]  right the people remember you from the server still yeah but I if somebody's
[7430.39s -> 7435.03s]  been around for that long that's like an entire that's a major a whole portion of
[7435.03s -> 7441.50s]  your whole life if you have been watching this channel if you subscribe
[7441.50s -> 7451.66s]  that long ago and you watch the videos and that's a lot of time why do you
[7451.66s -> 7457.68s]  shit on your old videos no I I tease my own old videos I love every video I've
[7457.68s -> 7463.26s]  ever made I really do except for a couple of them there's at least like a
[7463.26s -> 7466.50s]  handful of low-effort videos that I kind of just threw out there that I'm
[7466.50s -> 7472.93s]  not happy with but for the most part like 99% of every upload I've ever put
[7472.93s -> 7483.71s]  on YouTube I thought it was a great I loved every second of it and then
[7483.71s -> 7488.20s]  twitch is kind of the you know been doing it for how many how when did I
[7488.20s -> 7495.54s]  start streaming actually streaming and I was a streamer a fake streamer back in
[7495.54s -> 7503.78s]  like 2012 I streamed on twitch I streamed on YouTube not all the time but
[7503.78s -> 7513.35s]  maybe like once a month once every few months I would stream no I never on
[7513.35s -> 7532.16s]  Justin TV did I maybe one or two maybe like once on Justin TV but this is
[7532.16s -> 7536.80s]  another like next step you know just continuing to do what I like to do I
[7536.80s -> 7544.04s]  know a lot of people are sad and you know I missed those those videos I wish
[7544.04s -> 7550.43s]  you would make them again yeah you know part of me says the same thing but it's
[7550.43s -> 7554.11s]  kind of it's it kind of it's kind of just did it I dumbed if I kind of done
[7554.11s -> 7561.61s]  with that this platform is kind of what I enjoy to do and there's things I want
[7561.61s -> 7570.16s]  to try with it which you've seen some of them already and what's next I don't know
[7570.16s -> 7582.23s]  I have no idea I could never answer that question but let us get the credits on
[7582.23s -> 7587.54s]  the screen of all the subs from tonight or today yeah it's only eight yeah we're
[7587.54s -> 7593.72s]  ending early I forgot it's been seven hours and yeah it feels weird that it's
[7593.72s -> 7600.88s]  like 830 usually it's like 10 or 11 interesting holy fuck there were a lot
[7600.88s -> 7624.88s]  of subs thank you guys this is a shitload you guys are awesome some of you guys
[7624.88s -> 7627.44s]  tell me that you've been watching for years and some of you guys have been
[7627.44s -> 7636.06s]  paying this channel money for years it all it all boggles my mind sometimes and
[7636.06s -> 7642.79s]  it like now so it's really easy just to kind of forget and just oh yeah we're
[7642.79s -> 7646.84s]  streaming today whatever that's true what am I gonna stream today this
[7646.84s -> 7652.44s]  community has been large and fun and interesting for a long time and I can't
[7652.44s -> 7663.06s]  believe still this many years later we still have a couple more bits to do yeah
[7663.06s -> 7666.54s]  thanks this is this is a lot of fucking fun I hope it still is for you and when
[7666.54s -> 7673.68s]  it's not like I've said in the past then I'm not I don't want to like put
[7673.68s -> 7682.80s]  pressure on it having to be you know if it's not fun anymore it's not worth
[7682.84s -> 7691.93s]  doing you could pay me a fucking million dollars about maybe like I don't know
[7691.93s -> 7710.60s]  wait a minute no I I I can't like pretend to like have fun not very many
[7710.60s -> 7716.38s]  people can I don't think but I'm just gonna keep doing it well it's still fun
[7716.38s -> 7722.91s]  and I still enjoy pretty much 99% of every stream is just fun to do and fun
[7722.91s -> 7725.99s]  to be around a community of people that also think things are fun that think the
[7725.99s -> 7728.83s]  thing I'm doing is fun that think the thing is cool that they're seeing or
[7728.83s -> 7738.76s]  that they're participating in what was the 1% skate tree and carousel and Mario
[7738.76s -> 7755.84s]  tennis that makes up like 1% or like point like 4% or something your
[7755.84s -> 7758.76s]  transparency and honesty vastly outweighs the parts of your stream I
[7758.76s -> 7763.62s]  dislike of which there are quite a few that's powerful we don't like the
[7763.62s -> 7779.96s]  streams well I I don't really have I don't really have an answer for that you
[7779.96s -> 7785.17s]  know if you if you think that a bunch of stuff on the stream is like not funny
[7785.17s -> 7792.58s]  or not fun that I all I can do is try right all I can do is like all I can do
[7792.58s -> 7796.78s]  is just put forth the thing that I think is gonna be fun and if it's not then if
[7796.78s -> 7807.60s]  you don't think so then I can't like change your mind you know and look I'm
[7807.60s -> 7811.86s]  not gonna be I'll be completely honest here there's there are sometimes what I
[7811.86s -> 7817.18s]  know it's something's not fun and I try to do some try to make it fun try to
[7817.18s -> 7820.26s]  change it a little bit try to change the subject try to move on from something
[7820.26s -> 7823.26s]  you know what I mean it's it's it's it's kind of like a the nature of live
[7823.26s -> 7829.60s]  broadcasting for more than you know six seven plus eight hours at a time I'm
[7829.60s -> 7837.88s]  always trying to make it fun and I can't convince somebody that what I'm doing is
[7837.88s -> 7843.45s]  like funny or interesting or cool for you or interest or fun for you if you
[7843.45s -> 7847.45s]  make that decision for yourself then I what am I gonna tell you that you're
[7847.45s -> 7873.54s]  wrong I can't I can't do that I'm forcing you to watch this no I'm not
[7873.54s -> 7886.01s]  trying to you know jump on a comment that somebody makes it but I am NOT like
[7886.01s -> 7892.31s]  upset by that most of the time because I know okay if I was watching somebody
[7892.31s -> 7894.99s]  and I didn't think they were interesting or I didn't like a lot of
[7894.99s -> 7899.99s]  things they were doing if that person were to tell me that what I thought was
[7899.99s -> 7913.56s]  wrong then I would say well you're not me you don't know that right not every
[7913.56s -> 7917.36s]  streamer is for everyone it's all good yeah that's all good that does it that's
[7917.36s -> 7925.41s]  cool you're taking it too seriously you're the only streamer I never miss a
[7925.41s -> 7928.41s]  stream for if I didn't like you I wouldn't spend so much time here well I
[7928.41s -> 7936.81s]  appreciate your honesty so thank you that's I hope I hope you enjoy the
[7936.81s -> 7954.02s]  streams when you do come every stream is for me no but just that's we've had kind
[7954.02s -> 7966.16s]  of you know not not streaming just Jeremy's talking right and I'm just
[7966.16s -> 7972.84s]  trying to make him fun that's all I can do if I fail I fail at least I'm trying
[7972.84s -> 7984.76s]  at least I'm trying while I'm here this used to be a days gone stream and not
[7984.76s -> 7988.12s]  every stream that look and then nothing not every stream am I like oh I gotta
[7988.12s -> 7991.92s]  make sure something fucking hilarious and crazy and fun and it's gotta be
[7991.96s -> 7997.88s]  funny fuck for the most part when we talk about that it's it's like a joke
[7997.88s -> 8011.99s]  what about that clown car stream you'll see that in a little bit and like less
[8011.99s -> 8024.40s]  than five years you'll see it within five years you couldn't care about days
[8024.40s -> 8030.25s]  gone but you liked that I was streaming it well thank you again like I said I
[8030.25s -> 8038.07s]  if somebody you know tell every people telling me how awesome the streams are
[8038.07s -> 8044.68s]  and how much fun they are and how happy they are being here it's it's great it
[8044.68s -> 8052.29s]  really is but that I don't also want to then I never want stuff like that to
[8052.29s -> 8060.41s]  inflate who I think I am or who I want to be right I don't want my ego or my
[8060.41s -> 8066.65s]  narcissism to like take over and it's like yeah I'm just perfect everyone's
[8066.65s -> 8074.50s]  fucking everyone's wrong when they say anything bad so sometimes people say
[8074.62s -> 8078.30s]  you're taking it you're taking yourself too seriously here you go no you take
[8078.30s -> 8083.14s]  you too self-conscious you too it's cuz I want to stay grounded on certain things
[8083.14s -> 8107.58s]  that's why we bully you no no that's not why that's why we bully you you're
[8107.58s -> 8116.13s]  grounded no but it's good I'm still having a fucking ton of fun I would not
[8116.13s -> 8123.07s]  be able to sit here for seven fucking hours six to eight hours every time if
[8123.07s -> 8126.59s]  I didn't think it was fun I wouldn't be able to sit here for 45 minutes if I
[8126.59s -> 8139.25s]  didn't think it was fun no we did now we're alive we're here but we're going
[8139.25s -> 8156.88s]  to two more or three more no you look up more than that we got on a little
[8156.88s -> 8166.08s]  tangent there hopefully we're still live yeah to 29,000 drop frames damn over
[8166.08s -> 8177.77s]  seven hours that's that is like just barely barely tolerable that's just at
[8177.77s -> 8185.86s]  the point where it's tolerable but really annoying I gotta get on top of
[8185.86s -> 8191.04s]  this and try to get this fixed but speaking of that hey mr. Comcast thanks
[8191.04s -> 8195.81s]  to the 250 so I took my five-year-old child Jeremy Elbertson to get an ice
[8195.81s -> 8200.11s]  pop of his favorite master of comedy German 985 when he got his ice pop he
[8200.11s -> 8203.05s]  started screaming at the other children about how he's going to crash the
[8203.13s -> 8208.49s]  ball coin market with his six stock trading skills sadly his ice pop melted
[8208.49s -> 8213.81s]  in his hand as he talked the result of the ice pop looked like what can only be
[8213.81s -> 8217.33s]  described as Jermis face being randomized too many times in the Dark
[8217.33s -> 8229.52s]  Souls character creator yeah I love that that's like my favorite emote can I just
[8229.52s -> 8238.76s]  tell you I love that emote I love I love it I think it's fun I want to eat it too
[8238.76s -> 8247.28s]  I want to eat that emote in particular but thank you mr. Comcast thank you
[8247.28s -> 8251.48s]  mostly lost for the 250 nice shirt and nose hairs just zoom in on them and get
[8251.48s -> 8257.25s]  it over with thank you though thank you Tibetan hovercraft again for the three
[8257.25s -> 8263.32s]  dolls have you ever considered listening to fire sign theater I've never heard of
[8263.32s -> 8266.24s]  them if not I highly recommend checking them out their comedy seems very in line
[8266.24s -> 8275.91s]  with your sense of humor that I've never heard of them before I do a little bit
[8275.91s -> 8283.59s]  of a YouTube search today after the stream see what they're all about but
[8283.59s -> 8290.00s]  thank you for the recommendation splarg gave five community subs earlier thank
[8290.00s -> 8297.37s]  you about 20 minutes ago thank you splarg appreciate that just a five sub
[8297.37s -> 8304.40s]  drop stealthily at the end of the stream thank you all new thanks for ten bucks
[8304.40s -> 8306.96s]  hey German I would take the effort to make a made-up story about how you did
[8306.96s -> 8310.56s]  some cruel and absolutely insane crime against humanity that you would then
[8310.56s -> 8314.52s]  deny above all else but we all know what happens to those who expose the truth
[8314.52s -> 8330.33s]  monkey yes monkey yes there we go that was better thank you all of you for the
[8330.33s -> 8336.85s]  ten dollars and your cryptic message here thank you thanks for the ten bucks
[8336.85s -> 8348.48s]  thousand bits from all of you 250 came in from germa lied about Taco Bell which
[8348.48s -> 8354.24s]  videos are your least favorite all the modern warfare 3 videos all of them
[8354.24s -> 8363.31s]  except for grandpa and there was like seven or eight of them hey devil kitty
[8363.31s -> 8367.84s]  thanks for the 250 term I love you streams you make anything worthwhile
[8367.84s -> 8372.24s]  watching I want to watch every stream but as is evident by what time it is for
[8372.24s -> 8376.48s]  me I have to stay up to like six in the morning to watch you since you started
[8376.48s -> 8384.04s]  like two for me germa Hart oh yeah that's it's always that it's always tough
[8384.04s -> 8390.11s]  and really whenever I start a stream there's always gonna be some group of
[8390.11s -> 8396.99s]  people that aren't able to do it if I start at 2 p.m. if I start at 4 p.m. or
[8397.03s -> 8409.57s]  11 a.m. there's always somewhere around the world that cannot watch but there
[8409.57s -> 8414.80s]  honestly is not much I can really do and like I really I wish that I could kind
[8414.80s -> 8420.64s]  of have my stream broadcast out at everyone's current time zone but if it's
[8420.64s -> 8425.92s]  one or two o'clock in the afternoon where I am where I live that's just I
[8426.48s -> 8440.51s]  can't like rotate the earth so I really realistically it's it is just the way it
[8440.51s -> 8457.74s]  is because some some places like 14 15 say like 17 hours ahead well like 14
[8457.74s -> 8467.32s]  hours ahead as a Brit ruining my sleep schedule and watching your stream is one
[8467.32s -> 8472.66s]  of my guilty pleasures whenever I have time off University I'm glad that
[8472.82s -> 8480.46s]  you've chosen my stream to just chill and watch whenever you can if you want
[8480.46s -> 8487.69s]  to you know it's and that's another kind of thing about live broadcasting of the
[8487.69s -> 8496.26s]  seven eight hours of stream it goes through the whole day if it's 1 p.m. and
[8496.26s -> 8503.62s]  I start and I stop it you know 9 p.m. it goes through a whole day a whole period
[8503.62s -> 8506.14s]  when if you catch you don't have to catch the whole thing if you catch a
[8506.14s -> 8512.00s]  couple hours or something and then that's fine and I'm not it's hard to
[8512.00s -> 8520.66s]  like sit here a movie that you go to the theater for the longest ones ever in
[8520.66s -> 8528.06s]  history are three hours like 35 minutes like the extended edition of Lord of the
[8528.06s -> 8535.41s]  Rings is like three to four hours that's like watching two back-to-back extended
[8535.41s -> 8542.92s]  Lord of the Rings movies no it's how long is the extended Lord of the Rings
[8543.40s -> 8564.01s]  the average Marvel movie is four hours no it's not four hours and I got it I
[8564.01s -> 8571.89s]  got it right it's like about four hours but my point is is that it it's a long
[8571.89s -> 8579.26s]  time it's a lot of time so don't don't feel bad if you can't catch streams or
[8579.26s -> 8582.46s]  if you catch a little bit of odds or if you check it out on the second channel
[8582.46s -> 8589.35s]  I mean obviously I love when people are here but live obviously but it's a it's
[8589.43s -> 8594.91s]  a long time I can't expect anybody to be able to book their entire day and watch
[8594.91s -> 8597.75s]  the stream and if you do then I hope you fucking like the whole thing and hope
[8597.75s -> 8610.60s]  you have a lot of fun it's a long time I only love the people that are here live
[8610.60s -> 8618.18s]  that could not be further from the truth but almost at the end here and then I
[8618.18s -> 8624.80s]  will see you guys tomorrow early afternoon thank you to German light
[8624.80s -> 8629.52s]  about Taco Bell again for 260 what flavor is German pop it is the side of

[8639.58s -> 8643.42s]  and you smell it if you get it close to your face and you smell it smells like
