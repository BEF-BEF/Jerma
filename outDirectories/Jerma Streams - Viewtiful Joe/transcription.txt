[13793.06s -> 13799.03s]  week to take a shower brush your teeth and take a shit a week I'm gonna say it's probably it's
[13799.03s -> 13805.93s]  probably like what is about 10 minutes in the shower like five to ten minutes in the shower
[13806.73s -> 13813.64s]  two to four minutes to brush your teeth um and then about 15 to 45 minutes depending on

[14379.61s -> 14385.69s]  only fan well I'm not going to do an only fucking fans account this channel that's like 6,500 subs
[14385.69s -> 14392.65s]  right now why do I ever do with only fans what the hell would I do that for this channel has
[14392.97s -> 14398.70s]  65 fucking hundred subscriptions is there would there be a reason for me to open an only fans
[14398.70s -> 14415.61s]  that's for your fans that oh what he's bragging no I'm telling you that there's no but why why
[14415.61s -> 14420.65s]  would I have like another place for you hey you know I have I have there's a shitload of you that's
[14420.65s -> 14426.25s]  subbed to this channel and there's like thousands of you hey all of you do that again over here this
[14426.25s -> 14431.61s]  time but keep the twitch one going too you don't do two I want like three Netflix subscriptions
[14431.61s -> 14441.22s]  of you subscribed and then and fanning to me on four different websites oh by the way on one of
[14441.22s -> 14447.86s]  these websites yeah you're paying you pay like five ten dollars a month and oh maybe I'll do a
[14447.86s -> 14454.66s]  Facebook post every uh maybe two or three weeks and then maybe I'll do I'll do a video for like
[14454.66s -> 14464.58s]  two minutes going hey what's up my supporters and thanks thanks for thanks for triple dipping
[14464.58s -> 14482.52s]  how does he not know what it's not like a patreon what is it how do you have a website called only
[14482.52s -> 14497.34s]  fans and it's not like a fan's like sign up to make money and interact with your fans that's
[14497.34s -> 14508.98s]  what the tagline is this doesn't this is only fans sign up to make money and interact with your fans
[14508.98s -> 14517.18s]  how it works look this is just like a person like on camera anyone can earn as far as we're
[14517.18s -> 14521.10s]  concerned if you if you use one social media and produce your own content you should be using
[14521.10s -> 14526.54s]  only fans right whether you're uploading tutorials tips behind the scenes footage or endless selfies
[14526.54s -> 14539.88s]  right this that's what this what are you guys talking about number of followers how many
[14539.88s -> 14546.28s]  fall okay how many followers do I have let me follow up what I have I have 200 let's just round
[14546.28s -> 14551.32s]  it up to 300 000 okay how many number of followers no number follow okay my monthly subscription
[14551.32s -> 14559.86s]  price is 15 dollars a month that's fucking outrageous you could earn between 45 000 and
[14559.86s -> 14574.65s]  225 000 per month what hold on wait a minute wait you could earn 200 000 a month based on
[14574.65s -> 14578.97s]  an estimate between one percent and five percent of your followers subscribing that's not going
[14578.97s -> 14587.50s]  to be accurate is this a hold on this is saying that if I have 300 000 followers that between
[14587.50s -> 14595.70s]  30 and 40 000 will subscribe that's not accurate it's more like 0.2 or something and it would be
[14595.78s -> 14601.16s]  no this is inaccurate it would be like five dollars it would be five dollars a month
[14601.16s -> 14605.80s]  and I only have a hundred thousand twitter followers so you would earn between 4900 and
[14605.80s -> 14619.30s]  24 000 a month that's a lot of money it's a lot of money oh no when I say only I mean only fans
[14621.53s -> 14633.43s]  I didn't say the fans part afterwards only feet it's porn it doesn't look like it from here
[14633.43s -> 14647.93s]  it doesn't look like it from here this is the only fans porn videos no there's no porn videos
[14650.68s -> 14657.80s]  oh maybe it is only fans has put x-rated entertainment in the hands of the entertainers
[14657.80s -> 14664.86s]  the paywall of porn oh yeah but can't you hold on a second but can't you do like if you have a
[14664.86s -> 14669.82s]  patreon can't you do like a you do like a is this porn not allowed on patreon could you like porn
[14669.82s -> 14680.87s]  patreon patreon porn you do like a point so what's the difference it's not it is it's all
[14680.87s -> 14690.74s]  it's allowed oops I just that's a pornhub link I can't I it's not opening right close everything
[14690.74s -> 14695.03s]  alt f4 every fucking thing I'll turn the stream off all right that was a pornhub link the first
[14695.03s -> 14710.34s]  one so I'm not gonna I clicked it but I immediately x is gonna make it two hundred thousand dollars a
[14710.34s -> 14721.80s]  month that's that that's like that's like retire that's retire like that's like retire in six
[14721.80s -> 14728.33s]  months money if you're making three hundred thousand dollars a month for like a year
[14729.74s -> 14741.03s]  that's literally you're done forever and it's tax free that's horseshit that's there's no uh guys
[14741.03s -> 14745.69s]  there's no such thing as tax free okay let me let me just be honest with you
[14745.69s -> 14753.58s]  move on I make double that I make four hundred thousand dollars a month
[14755.74s -> 14760.60s]  if I made four hundred thousand dollars a month I would have already reached out to
[14760.60s -> 14764.44s]  fucking Danny DeVito's agent and he I would have tried he would have streamed in my place
[14765.83s -> 14770.47s]  with like a like makeup on to look like me are you fucking serious you really think I wouldn't do
[14770.47s -> 14776.07s]  that are you are you kidding me if I made like half a million dollars a month I would make I
[14776.07s -> 14779.27s]  would I would hire a hundred clowns just to fucking sit in the room silent with me
[14780.23s -> 14792.22s]  like for a week straight and I would never address them you guys I'm dead wait what just
[14792.22s -> 14812.12s]  happened what's wrong with me what the hell's going on here did I wait okay I'm gonna hold
[14812.12s -> 14816.76s]  you to that when you really really make it big oh what the it's knocking me back into the other
[14816.76s -> 14828.60s]  part of the level the stream potential the jerk has plans what else would I do
[14833.05s -> 14844.04s]  just okay we're fine what does this want me to do what else would I do I I mean I'm full of
[14844.04s -> 14851.30s]  fucking stupid ideas I know that that's like a you hear a lot of them but there's stuff that
[14851.30s -> 14863.80s]  I've really always wanted to do but I mean who knows now come down if money was no object what's
[14863.80s -> 14871.24s]  the most out there idea well I I really really really really want to do another live action
[14871.24s -> 14884.12s]  germa rumble but I want it to be I want it to be like actually live like on twitch and I want a
[14884.12s -> 14896.50s]  bunch of crazy shit to happen on that stream I want it live on twitch not like a video come on
[14896.50s -> 14907.00s]  I'm trying to fucking make this happen I'm dead oh my god am I dead I'm dead I'm not I'm alive
[14907.00s -> 14916.42s]  I'm good I'm alive I really want to see you well here's you want here's something that's
[14916.42s -> 14924.58s]  actually kind of funny germa rumble live action 2 is already written already it's already done
[14924.58s -> 14929.77s]  it just has to be made that's a secret that I've held on to for a probably a couple of like a year
[14929.77s -> 14937.38s]  and a half it's already written the whole thing the whole thing's done everything is there the
[14937.38s -> 14942.02s]  only thing that would need to change is some characters that may have been more relevant
[14942.02s -> 14947.75s]  like a year and a half ago would have to just be replaced but there's this stuff in there that
[14947.75s -> 14956.34s]  hopefully if I ever had like an opportunity what the fuck if I ever had the opportunity
[14956.34s -> 14970.60s]  it would be a lot of fun I have it only for fun though well it's not even necessarily
[14973.03s -> 14984.26s]  there's there's like other options too and it's not because all right the carnival the carnival
[14984.26s -> 14988.98s]  was just like a fun thing to do and something I really really wanted to do and it was it was a
[14988.98s -> 14994.66s]  ton of fun I have blast doing it had a ton of fun making it and it was a blast and that was
[14995.54s -> 15000.82s]  I paid for the whole thing there was no sponsor there was no outside help it was literally just
[15000.82s -> 15010.46s]  I just was like here it's just a bunch of money okay do it if there was someone if like a sponsor
[15010.46s -> 15014.54s]  or something and as we've talked about it before the guys that did carnival we've had a lot of
[15014.54s -> 15022.17s]  conversations about this if it was possible it maybe that would be an avenue maybe maybe having
[15022.17s -> 15028.65s]  somebody that could could pony up a ton more money to do something crazy like that right I
[15028.65s -> 15033.85s]  don't have to make five hundred thousand dollars a month to do germa rumble life too the way that I
[15033.85s -> 15039.85s]  want it it would just have to make sense and it would have to be something that I that I didn't
[15041.59s -> 15046.23s]  I never wanted to get to a point where I take money on this stream for fun just because it's
[15046.23s -> 15054.54s]  there like the reason to do a sponsored stream like that would be solely to make it actually
[15054.54s -> 15068.68s]  happen it wouldn't be burning really any other reason I gotta go down it's not gonna happen
[15069.40s -> 15093.13s]  how do I do this oh it's gonna crush me I can't move I think I do I have the right idea what have
[15093.13s -> 15097.37s]  you sold tickets no I would want it to be free I just want I want to be able to people watch it
[15097.37s -> 15103.05s]  and not to pay for it and pay per view no that's too much that's too far I don't I wouldn't want
[15103.05s -> 15133.91s]  to do that how can I not do this I can jump through that contact yeah this we'll see I think it's
[15133.91s -> 15140.44s]  just to see it live would be fine yeah but the thing about venues like that you just have to
[15140.44s -> 15149.35s]  remember it it would have to be wherever it was filmed it would have to be you know obviously
[15149.35s -> 15154.87s]  protected and safe from anyone just kind of coming in and just hey I'm here I'm on the stream now
[15155.83s -> 15163.86s]  so having like a private venue is probably better especially if it's like a scripted event I gotta
[15163.86s -> 15168.10s]  make sure the right shit is done right people are involved because if it's just like oh hey guys
[15168.10s -> 15173.62s]  by the way we're at this venue welcome everybody to turbo rebel live twitch edition then oh and
[15173.62s -> 15178.42s]  there's five cars that just pulled up and there are just people are coming in people are knocking
[15178.42s -> 15206.82s]  on the door oh you can punch that guys he can punch that guys he can punch that thing the heck
[15206.82s -> 15271.59s]  but that's another thing like funding for a fuck I'm done I said all right I said we'll call it
[15271.59s -> 15277.14s]  her I'll see you tomorrow hey 500 dollars dude don't read that out loud because it's outrageous
[15278.62s -> 15288.86s]  uh so are we gonna fund this no no no what I was gonna say is I don't want to have a large stream
[15288.86s -> 15297.30s]  be the sole responsibility for you guys to pay for it hey I can't wait to do I'm gonna hype you
[15297.30s -> 15304.90s]  guys up turbo rumble live too I just need a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars guys
[15304.90s -> 15313.02s]  I just need like I need like seventy five thousand dollars everybody come on let's go like I don't
[15313.02s -> 15328.02s]  want to do that we have a number now no that's not even accurate not even accurate because there be
[15328.02s -> 15334.12s]  I would want you know obviously if you can get like a sponsor to cover a majority of that that's a
[15334.28s -> 15344.49s]  big deal it's gonna be more than that maybe the shit that I want to have happen on that stream is
[15344.49s -> 15351.40s]  like that they're gonna have to let's just put it this way it's gonna have to be uh four or five
[15351.40s -> 15361.16s]  different units on set for that so but there's other things that have been worked on just I don't
[15361.16s -> 15365.56s]  I'm not talking about them because why talk about something unless it's ready to go or makes any
[15365.56s -> 15383.70s]  sense or is real what kind of unit well you thought I was gonna do it no but uh yeah well
[15383.70s -> 15388.58s]  we'll call it here did I even explain what the new schedule was before I feel like I started
[15388.58s -> 15392.26s]  halfway and then I just gave up and like somebody called me stupid and I like yelled at them what
[15392.26s -> 15401.10s]  happened did I even explain it to anybody all right so what this channel has been used to has
[15401.10s -> 15410.02s]  been about three days a week for six to eight hours changing it because of my medical problems
[15410.98s -> 15415.22s]  it's better for me to do this in small doses but I'm going to do it more times a week
[15416.18s -> 15419.74s]  so instead of three to four times a week we're going to go four or five times a week
[15420.38s -> 15428.15s]  for about four to five hours a stream that's the plan so the streams will be shorter but they will
[15428.15s -> 15433.72s]  be at least one more day so it'll it'll actually turn out to be probably around the same time
[15433.72s -> 15450.06s]  streamed but just spread out a little more but yeah he has a yes make them shorter but funnier
[15450.62s -> 15455.19s]  I mean I just I don't have an I don't know how you can't how you do that
[15458.60s -> 15459.80s]  shorter but funnier
[15465.08s -> 15471.56s]  is that even I don't know how do I even how just be you have to be funny all right
[15472.20s -> 15480.20s]  I contrary to think popular belief here there is no plan when I turn a stream guys I'm not just
[15480.20s -> 15486.15s]  like okay I've got these 200 jokes ready I've got they're all lined up in front of me on
[15486.15s -> 15491.40s]  six pieces of paper I'm gonna go bullet to bullet it's kind of just kind of shit just
[15491.40s -> 15505.82s]  kind of happens show the joke list you have to break a leg use the sneeze macro it's gone
[15505.82s -> 15511.98s]  this thing had to be unplugged and like I did deleted shit leak the joke list
[15513.42s -> 15520.02s]  maybe I should start writing stuff down well I do have a lot of stuff written down would you
[15520.02s -> 15523.46s]  like to see would you like to hear what some of the ideas are written down they're gonna happen
[15523.46s -> 15530.71s]  in the next probably month or so I'll read them to you streams here we go I'll read a couple to
[15530.71s -> 15539.45s]  you let's see if I remember what any of these are green screen DLC obviously that's still
[15539.45s -> 15547.78s]  going to happen the iPad stream the iPad stream that's somebody had this this interesting concept
[15547.78s -> 15554.26s]  where you go to like YouTube on the iPad and click on every ad that's for a video game downloaded
[15554.26s -> 15559.98s]  and play it for 20 minutes and just do that continue to do it I'm gonna need a fucking new
[15559.98s -> 15571.14s]  iPad after that but you know that was one of the things to do like all those just mobile game ads
[15571.14s -> 15575.54s]  click of and download them but then I'm gonna get like tracked for life so that one hasn't happened
[15575.54s -> 15582.66s]  yet the easy bake oven stream is still on the on the plants here just have to buy a few more
[15582.66s -> 15588.50s]  things for it but that's gonna happen sooner rather than later oh another one that's gonna
[15588.50s -> 15599.58s]  happen soon you I was gonna get a bunch of those old kids board games like slobber and Sam
[15600.38s -> 15606.06s]  and like mousetrap and just get like a two dozen of them and just try to play them and like over
[15606.06s -> 15610.92s]  like a two stream period I was thinking about maybe even seeing if other like people might
[15610.92s -> 15614.28s]  want to do that get like four or five people to try to play these stupid shitty games from like
[15614.28s -> 15621.08s]  1995 that's another one that's coming up probably what else we got all right we got mad world for
[15621.08s -> 15632.41s]  the week that's written here for some reason that's here uh monster lab for the week we can

[15676.42s -> 15684.22s]  and try to play through it like just pick random character and play and see how far i can get with
[15684.22s -> 15697.02s]  each character that's probably a terabyte of space that's a hundred terabytes are you serious
[15698.17s -> 15703.93s]  some characters have viruses but what if i just get another computer like can i use like an old
[15703.93s -> 15709.77s]  laptop or something or an old like desktop and just get a one like two terabyte drive and that's
[15709.77s -> 15718.65s]  just the mu gun computer and like even if it gets a bunch of viruses who cares that's money no i'm

[16159.26s -> 16171.05s]  what is this is this some kind of a line there there's a comedy line i've said all right look
[16171.05s -> 16214.82s]  at can you read that produced produced produced with produced produced with genetic engineering
[16215.46s -> 16231.34s]  what the fuck does that even mean produced with genetic engineering
[16234.41s -> 16245.61s]  it's a 5g easy bake oven most food it's well it's a gmo oh that means gmo why did they say made with
[16245.61s -> 16248.89s]  gmos why they put genetic engineering that makes it sound like a resident evil plot
[16256.74s -> 16264.87s]  mixes contain wheat milk egg soy and trace amounts of peanuts tree nuts and something else
[16267.32s -> 16275.96s]  allergen information okay uh mixes contain wheat milk egg soy allergic to soy trace amounts of

[16344.20s -> 16350.54s]  stream to you that's that's a stream leak do you think it said do you think in there it says like
[16350.54s -> 16362.15s]  do not consume alcohol when operating the easy bake oven right probably probably bad idea right
[16366.55s -> 16379.45s]  well it's for kids so it's right okay i know but what if it all right okay no it's not this is not
[16379.45s -> 16385.29s]  a nintendo labo this is a large piece of fucking electronic equipment that i could burn myself

[16394.65s -> 16410.17s]  of wine can you have before using an easy bake oven one well what the what uh it was designed
[16410.17s -> 16417.38s]  to be used with a dumb brain it's made for what it's made for kids yeah but that doesn't mean you
[16417.38s -> 16423.45s]  can you you can still get hurt what's the temperature that it gets in there oh this is
[16423.45s -> 16427.21s]  kind of freaking me out is this thing getting like i hate ovens by the way have we never even

[16461.98s -> 16469.26s]  like five fucking hundred degree little box that has gas going into it and it this i did the same
[16469.26s -> 16473.91s]  thing i've said we talked about yes i have all right okay you're doing the same words i know i
[16473.91s -> 16480.20s]  just got to be clear that's i asked i asked i know i know i've talked about it before so
[16481.00s -> 16486.28s]  how what is what does it get to be like 400 degrees in here how hot does an easy bake oven get
[16487.43s -> 16499.35s]  like 350 how much is how hot does it get it's a children's toy with gas no you don't hope
[16499.35s -> 16505.27s]  does it feel like a gas line i'm just saying how hot does it get it's it's wait an easy bake oven
[16505.27s -> 16515.93s]  is a light bulb it's a fucking light bulb it cooks with the light bulb is that can you you can't how
[16516.49s -> 16520.81s]  oh that's not even accurate i put my hand up to some like halogen lights before and been like
[16520.81s -> 16530.54s]  oh shit that's fucking toasty i never thought to put like sprinkles on it so it's just it's
[16530.54s -> 16538.14s]  just a light i could have a glass of wine if it's a light if it's just a light bulb
[16538.94s -> 16547.42s]  i'm gonna look that up it's heat remember don't eat the light bulb i'm not gonna eat the light
[16547.42s -> 16569.99s]  bulb let's see how hot how hot does an easy bake oven get to 375 fucking degrees guys that's not a
[16570.07s -> 16582.20s]  light bulb that's 400 degrees that's your oven gets to be 350 400 that's gonna fuck i'm getting
[16582.20s -> 16593.24s]  hurt it's a light bulb how hot is the light bulb in this room right now how hot is this light bulb
[16593.24s -> 16606.34s]  let's see that's hot is that 375 degrees though okay let me ask a question i actually have a
[16606.34s -> 16612.18s]  question for you guys so when you touch a light bulb and you go fuck that's hot how hot is that
[16612.18s -> 16617.06s]  what degrees what what at what degree are you like whoa that's fucking hot like your light bulb
[16617.06s -> 16626.42s]  the light bulb in your room i'm sure you like right 200 200 okay so you tell me that that is
[16626.42s -> 16633.90s]  gonna get 175 degrees hotter than the whoa that's hot okay i'm afraid to put i'm afraid to use this
[16633.90s -> 16640.49s]  in my room i'm gonna like i'm gonna do the stream like in the garage i'm gonna go to i'm gonna do
[16640.49s -> 16646.89s]  like a garage stream that's gonna be creepy as fuck by the way what a creepy fucking stream
[16647.53s -> 16663.78s]  i'm doing an easy bake oven stream in a garage that's terrifying let's have bugleberry do it
[16663.78s -> 16670.26s]  no that's you know how hot bugleberry gets do you understand that how hot bugleberry gets
[16670.26s -> 16676.42s]  in his skin how hot bugleberry's skin is when he's sitting there with the trench coat on and his big
[16676.42s -> 16682.62s]  fucking face you know how hot it is in that trench coat probably pretty hot i would say if i was
[16682.62s -> 16694.10s]  bugleberry and i was sitting there for like 20 straight minutes in if i was him i haven't used
[16694.10s -> 16701.69s]  light bulbs for easy bake ovens in literally decades so what is in there i'm gonna be like
[16701.69s -> 16711.22s]  wicked safety about this i'm gonna be so safe with this you have no idea because it's not just easy
[16711.22s -> 16718.04s]  bake oven easy bake oven is probably the main event of that stream i would say i'm gonna get
[16718.04s -> 16724.34s]  a bunch of those little like kits those little uh like cooking kits like remember the thing i
[16724.34s -> 16735.67s]  tweeted out i'm gonna get like three or four maybe five six of those and do them blend no it's a
[16735.67s -> 16742.82s]  fucking toaster yeah but i would don't be like scared of a toaster i don't know anything that
[16742.82s -> 16747.86s]  generates heat it just kind of yeah for some reason it freaks me out i know it's like safe and
[16747.86s -> 16755.78s]  shit but even a toaster it's like this is this is little it's a little these wires in there and they
[16755.78s -> 16760.82s]  just get to be like six fucking million degrees just so concentrated concentrated fucking heat
[16760.82s -> 16764.66s]  and i just like i don't even know i want to cook i wish like i wish i could cook with the sun
[16765.86s -> 16770.34s]  if i could cook with the sun i'd be that'd be great if there was like in everybody's backyard just one
[16770.34s -> 16776.79s]  beam of fucking insanely hot like 400 degree heat light that was just in your backyard oh you just
[16776.79s -> 16779.99s]  like put like a hamburger fucking out there and like underneath the light it was like
[16781.03s -> 16794.86s]  you flipped it you live in vegas you can do that not until august the sun is way hotter all right
[16795.50s -> 16798.94s]  when you go like this i know we're supposed to be ending the stream but i have i have questions
[16799.66s -> 16807.90s]  when you like a line like this and it's 120 like 115 degrees outside how hot it's 115 degrees
[16808.78s -> 16820.79s]  it's gonna say how hot is the sun on your face it's 115 degrees that's how hard it is outside
[16820.79s -> 16828.71s]  that's how hard it is i don't know why i thought that like it was like a chemical reaction on your
[16828.71s -> 16833.35s]  face i don't know why i'm thinking that when the sun that's 115 like is hitting your face there's
[16833.35s -> 16842.71s]  like a chemical reaction that goes up to like 180 you'd fucking melt your skin would be peeling
[16842.71s -> 16850.98s]  up humidity that's what i'm doing everybody hold on a second humidity right if if it's like
[16851.78s -> 16863.72s]  if it's like 75 humidity then it'd be 115 that it would go up to like 130 how hot is hot
[16863.72s -> 16868.81s]  if it's humid it's nice no it's not absolutely horrible thing i just heard somebody say
[16868.89s -> 16877.85s]  humanity is the worst thing in the world it just is i would i'm such a lizard fuck i dry just dry

[17167.34s -> 17183.59s]  he's mad mad enough to eat a fucking battery on stream no i don't want to put that that scares me
[17183.59s -> 17189.59s]  because can you like touch if you okay this is the plus and minus if i like touch my tongue to the
[17189.59s -> 17193.27s]  plus and like this is like a current on the my i like it i'll just shock my mouth i'm not gonna
[17193.27s -> 17196.87s]  do that that's a fucking terrible idea that's a mistake you could actually get you could actually
[17196.87s -> 17203.10s]  get hurt by that all right what's more dangerous putting a battery in your mouth
[17203.10s -> 17206.94s]  or operating an easy bake oven the way that it's supposed to be by the manual
[17214.58s -> 17219.14s]  like if i went like this and stuck my tongue on the battery is that more dangerous than operating
[17219.14s -> 17223.86s]  the easy bake oven with with with parent adult supervision the way that it's intended to what's
[17223.86s -> 17247.02s]  more dangerous where does iq go i have 124 iq by the way 60 performance iq but like 100 visual and
[17247.02s -> 17256.70s]  then like 80 linguistical that's actually real i did a real like four hour long iq test when i
[17256.70s -> 17261.18s]  was like 17 or 16 i did it again when i was 20 because i wanted to find out what was wrong with
[17261.18s -> 17266.62s]  me and it turned out i was really fucking smart but i was really stupid at doing things correctly
[17266.62s -> 17283.40s]  there you go it was on facebook no oh yeah click here five minute 10 questions yeah those are just
[17283.40s -> 17291.48s]  ways to find out how you lean politically by the way guys oh question number three solve this uh
[17291.48s -> 17297.08s]  solve this cube this cube you have to move some pieces around uh thanks for clicking on our iq
[17297.08s -> 17303.72s]  test nice nice okay next so it's over here it's over here is joe biden and then bernie sanders
[17303.72s -> 17310.52s]  is over here uh which one of these two would you would you say you lean more towards uh this one
[17310.68s -> 17319.22s]  okay okay so question six is um solve for x that's all they care about they don't the questions
[17319.22s -> 17324.82s]  one two three five six seven eight nine ten are fucking meaningless they just want question three
[17324.82s -> 17349.26s]  answered and you'll do it remind us collecting data he actually took a facebook iq test i think
[17349.26s -> 17360.09s]  i did it on this stream like two months ago the stream is never ending i'm just chilling
[17360.41s -> 17373.74s]  sometimes i just hang out those years ago no that was when i was in vegas for our adhd exam stream
[17374.54s -> 17378.94s]  i couldn't it's it's it's not even embarrassing me selling telling you this because
[17379.58s -> 17383.34s]  hold on i'm not done i said my streams are gonna be like four to five hours we're
[17383.34s -> 17389.90s]  almost five which is this is like a hangout session um if i took a like a high school test
[17389.90s -> 17397.58s]  right now like a real one an actual high school test geography math science social studies
[17397.58s -> 17404.97s]  whatever history i felt i would i'm gonna be realistic very realistic i'd get probably
[17404.97s -> 17411.21s]  between five and ten points on the test without question i would not get more than ten points
[17415.18s -> 17431.03s]  stand up and pace why stand up and pace and talk to you oh yeah because i can move around
[17434.26s -> 17443.00s]  okay so i mean if i took that test right now if i was in your classroom this is weird to me
[17443.96s -> 17458.01s]  i don't i don't like this i hate this i need a microphone right here if i don't have a
[17458.01s -> 17461.77s]  microphone right here then i'm just like i'm just like a guy in a room like walking around like no
[17461.77s -> 17470.04s]  vr headset or anything i'm just standing around and talking so if you gave me a test right now
[17470.04s -> 17475.40s]  and it was a high school test and by the way why why do i always just not look at anybody
[17476.04s -> 17482.22s]  right if there's a whole audience here i'm never looking at anyone in the audience literally ever
[17482.22s -> 17485.98s]  i'm looking at the exit signs that's a tip by the way for those of you public speakers that want some
[17485.98s -> 17491.18s]  public speaking tips just look at the exit signs back and forth that's how you do it so what you
[17491.18s -> 17494.22s]  do is you go like this there's an exit sign over there i'm going to talk at that exit sign and i'm
[17494.22s -> 17497.98s]  going to move our eyes over here and talk to this exit sign over here i'm going to make a couple of
[17497.98s -> 17503.34s]  points over on this exit sign and then somebody's gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna lock i'm gonna lock
[17503.34s -> 17508.22s]  fucking eye contact with somebody randomly in the audience and it's gonna freak the both of us out

[17832.34s -> 17841.93s]  whole rundown pretty much every level he was everything he did it was a different game oh
[17842.74s -> 17845.86s]  that's not the same game jackie chan adventures what was the one that star played
[17853.67s -> 17859.90s]  what was the stunt master oh i didn't know there was more than one jackie chan game for

[17934.10s -> 17939.64s]  there's only two ratings there and by the way minus two and plus two are not ratings for video
[17939.64s -> 17945.48s]  games there did you think the last thing said was funny and you're not using the rating system
[17945.48s -> 17951.53s]  correctly i think a lot of you have not been using the rating system correctly for a little

[18093.22s -> 18098.58s]  meant jackie i meant jackie chan stunt master so you did mean the one that started the video one

[18129.02s -> 18138.23s]  happened to my thing what do i think what the fuck happened to my thing

[18163.62s -> 18181.18s]  drew crew is back no they are not no they're not they are not no there we go all right i got it
[18182.31s -> 18191.11s]  uh we had 250 from yen wen president artist and they say uh i was thinking of recommending a game
[18191.11s -> 18207.83s]  that's by the same video i was thinking about recommending a game by the same developers as
[18207.83s -> 18218.20s]  beautiful joe clover studios which was founded by capcom however the game is around 30 plus hours
[18218.20s -> 18225.05s]  i'm about 34 hours into my play through him at the last level the game is okami i've actually
[18225.05s -> 18232.73s]  experienced okami before a great game the painting paintbrush the dog i think that's correct i think
[18232.73s -> 18236.17s]  that's the right game because you're a little you're a dog right you have a paintbrush you paint
[18236.17s -> 18245.50s]  with the paint for the wiimote yeah that's great it's a great game when you have a germa 985 video
[18245.50s -> 18252.70s]  about it i don't think i made a video on okami but i have played it so i probably wouldn't stream
[18252.70s -> 18257.90s]  it but it is fantastic it's a classic and then they didn't they remade it they remastered it
[18257.90s -> 18269.80s]  once or twice right he's played it get out of it but thanks for the recommendation yen wen
[18269.80s -> 18276.58s]  it's a great game hey drax von tour thanks for the 500 bits germa my brothers and i have loved
[18276.58s -> 18282.82s]  watching you for years and my dog is your biggest fan so this is from all of us hey thanks drax
[18282.82s -> 18287.54s]  von tour's dog also you should play the wonderful one-on-one when it comes out for the pc directed
[18287.54s -> 18291.38s]  by the same guy who directed beautiful joe another great game i have played it i played it when i was
[18291.38s -> 18294.66s]  on the wii u because it was one of the only games on the wii u that were worth buying
[18295.54s -> 18304.57s]  now there's probably four uh and that was one of them i have played it and it's very good i'm glad
[18304.57s -> 18315.11s]  they're actually gonna put it somewhere else but thanks again it's time for slime what's going on
[18315.11s -> 18320.71s]  time for slime thanks for the thousand bits 10 bucks you should filter out all caps chat messages
[18320.71s -> 18328.78s]  for a day just as an experiment see how much it throws off chat or to go another step further
[18328.78s -> 18334.94s]  uh shadow ban people that write paragraphs in all caps but here's the sad part about doing
[18334.94s -> 18343.66s]  something like that is we remove we then remove a person like the beautiful joe go brr thing
[18344.22s -> 18347.82s]  that was all caps that person was just fucking that person just that person was just thinking
[18347.82s -> 18351.26s]  they were gonna get banned you know what i mean they they probably was just like you know i'm
[18351.26s -> 18357.46s]  probably gonna get like timed out for this did they i'm not even sure they did like that was a
[18357.46s -> 18367.98s]  fucking paragraph in caps does everybody like have that message where is it what was the exact
[18367.98s -> 18383.69s]  message that is now in all caps mode if you ban me it was long it was super long and i it was just
[18388.38s -> 18392.46s]  i don't think anybody can i don't think it's like an elusive beast i don't think anybody has it
[18392.46s -> 18406.25s]  i don't think anybody has it but yeah maybe sometime we'll try it maybe one day for fun
[18406.89s -> 18414.86s]  thanks for the 10 bucks though appreciate it thank you trans scalp for the 500 bits
[18414.86s -> 18418.70s]  jerma trapped me in a mason jar and forgot to put holes in the lid jerma please it's so dark in

[18440.04s -> 18451.30s]  uh whoops thanks to the 500 bits though you're really trying to get my attention to let you
[18451.30s -> 18458.74s]  out of that jar hey shadows one disciple thanks for the 250 hey king that's me i guess i want
[18458.74s -> 18464.26s]  to meet up on club penguin after tonight's stream uh visit my igloo and i can get you an invite to
[18464.26s -> 18469.70s]  cracking gamer the service comes out in a couple weeks also in regards to your recent medical
[18469.70s -> 18475.54s]  problems i wanted to give you a hearty better shop it means get well soon in my language dutch
[18475.54s -> 18484.18s]  better shop well thank you you want to do an invite to cracking gamer we already are there

[18500.33s -> 18506.90s]  in club penguin i can't believe that service is still on silent serenity thanks for the 250
[18506.90s -> 18511.54s]  asking chat what game they want to watch seems like asking 5 000 toddlers what they want for
[18511.54s -> 18518.18s]  lunch the only way to win is to give them the streamer equivalent to mcdonald's aka play family
[18518.18s -> 18532.04s]  feud why is it so true it's such a what that's such a true statement drew crew played jojo
[18532.76s -> 18538.09s]  beautiful joe sucked out like i don't like burger king all right fine we're gonna go to mcdonald's
[18538.65s -> 18542.57s]  yeah yeah everyone that's so happy everyone gets so happy when you say that
[18548.94s -> 18553.66s]  i think that's also like obviously we're making them we fuck around a lot on these streams
[18553.66s -> 18561.56s]  but i think the nature of playing a different game almost every single day this stream never
[18561.56s -> 18566.12s]  sees the same game like there's not like a game that it's like oh i play that we're gonna go to
[18566.12s -> 18571.00s]  mcdonald's there is no mcdonald's on this stream there really kind of isn't because there's a new
[18571.00s -> 18577.48s]  game every two or three streams at least so we kind of just try different restaurants every
[18577.48s -> 18581.61s]  single day and some people don't like those restaurants some people want me to go to another
[18581.61s -> 18585.77s]  restaurant some people want me to go back to a restaurant that they really like that they love
[18585.77s -> 18597.61s]  eating at and i love that restaurant too i think that's part of the reason why there's a lot of
[18597.61s -> 18606.09s]  requests you're the guy for the area of streaming i take two bites of the burger and then i leave
[18606.09s -> 18612.33s]  and i go oh that was that's killer oh out of the park man oh you nailed it you nailed it and then
[18612.33s -> 18618.38s]  we play another one the next day and in the background and in the background you just
[18626.20s -> 18626.44s]  or
[18633.08s -> 18638.44s]  there's two different songs there's oh there's only two songs only two on any episode of
[18638.44s -> 18645.38s]  dinos drives and dives there's the i'm gonna give you a list of stuff that this restaurant does
[18645.38s -> 18649.56s]  i'm gonna give you and it's gonna guy get a guy's gonna be like this he's gonna have a plate and
[18649.56s -> 18653.88s]  he's gonna just like throw the plate into the camera it's gonna go ding ding ding ding ding ding
[18653.88s -> 18658.36s]  ding don't wear it to join and then he starts explaining all the things in the menu that's that
[18658.36s -> 18664.07s]  one the other song is that i'm about to take a big fucking bite of your hamburger so it's
[18664.71s -> 18669.11s]  oh i got no i don't want to put that on camera that's weird he goes in for the bite and it does
[18669.11s -> 18675.83s]  that
[18680.07s -> 18685.98s]  there's only two songs on that show but it works and that's a great show i love that show
[18685.98s -> 18691.67s]  that show is fucking phenomenal i i'm one of these i'm a weirdo i like to watch guyfieri take bites
[18691.67s -> 18698.12s]  of hamburgers while i eat my bucket of kentucky fried chicken i i love eating with guyfieri i
[18698.20s -> 18701.40s]  love watching him like oh where is this like crepe restaurant oh cool man
[18703.08s -> 18708.06s]  i'm eating food too and i love my i like my food i'm watching you eat food while i like to eat my
[18708.06s -> 18713.72s]  food too where's he now oh those ribs look good another bite of my fucking taco oh man i love
[18713.72s -> 18721.02s]  food if you don't do that then i also don't believe that you don't spend 30 minutes in the
[18721.02s -> 18740.94s]  bathroom sometimes you do fiery mukbangs so who cares he's i really like guyfieri i think he's
[18741.02s -> 18748.78s]  great i really do i i like him i really like i think he's i think he's fucking phenomenal he's
[18748.78s -> 18764.79s]  such a swell person he seems like a cool dude yeah he he does i bet you he's if you met guyfieri
[18766.39s -> 18769.67s]  you were out somewhere and i'm like you went it was in one of his restaurants he was there
[18769.67s -> 18773.75s]  i bet you'd come over and i bet you he would he'd be so happy to talk to you yeah i really
[18773.75s -> 18782.42s]  believe that that's what i hear what is he your best friend
[18785.35s -> 18797.58s]  he's best friend material i'm not going to talk to a grown man with a flame shirt
[18799.11s -> 18808.10s]  no no but but you'll watch a grown man in a star wars shirt and you see how that logic is kind of
[18808.10s -> 18819.13s]  a little flawed you'll watch a grown man eat his shoe right i'm not that different than guyfieri
[18819.13s -> 18830.94s]  except my hair is not as cool pronounce it right it's fieri right fieri fieri it's not fieri it's
[18830.94s -> 18841.66s]  it's it's it's fieri fieri guyfieri yeti there it is i knew it i ate my burger while you were
[18841.66s -> 18850.76s]  eating your shoe he's got a shirt he's gets it's like a brand it's an image he's like a he's got
[18850.76s -> 18858.28s]  his own brand like who cares he wears like the bowling shirt he's got the hair it's a brand
[18858.28s -> 18864.38s]  thing it's like an image thing so you now you you know who he is you could recognize guyfieri
[18865.34s -> 18876.66s]  from a mile away you would know who he was what's the germa brand i don't have one i don't need a
[18876.66s -> 18895.26s]  brand toilet water that's not a brand that's a delicious drink anyways all right we're getting

[19249.80s -> 19254.68s]  thanks for the 500 bits i was curious about the mugen stream so i checked the character archive
[19255.32s -> 19263.22s]  and there are about 71 500 characters most of them are around 10 to 100 megabytes
[19263.22s -> 19267.62s]  so assuming they average around 50 megabytes downloading every character would take about
[19267.62s -> 19280.71s]  3.57 terabytes jesus 71 fucking thousand characters how what does the character's
[19280.71s -> 19290.71s]  select screen look like it's just a bunch of dots it's not even possible that's almost but
[19290.71s -> 19302.10s]  oh i'm gonna do it there's a hundred pages of characters holy shit is that can you even
[19302.10s -> 19314.63s]  play the game like that you just screen for porn oh i will don't worry you're gonna fucking brick
[19314.63s -> 19321.11s]  a pc well hopefully it's an old one that doesn't matter one that i haven't really cared about in
[19321.11s -> 19328.23s]  probably five plus years i'm just gonna have to put a hard drive in it a few of them can you buy
[19329.19s -> 19335.83s]  okay what those not an ssd because a five terabyte ssd would be like 2000 fucking dollars
[19336.79s -> 19346.06s]  a five or 10 terabyte hard disk drive would be you can still get this for pretty cheap right
[19346.78s -> 19356.79s]  yeah like a 10 terabyte s uh hdd would be probably a couple hundred bucks hundred bucks
[19357.67s -> 19364.42s]  okay that's much better than like two or three thousand all right i'm gonna have my mugen drive
[19364.42s -> 19374.76s]  drive i see everybody doing a link here the whole chat is purple so i'm gonna just i'm gonna
[19374.76s -> 19409.86s]  screen it see what it is this is a six second video this is called crew crew take a look it's
[19409.86s -> 19444.25s]  off six seconds long check it out it's the true crew why does it take me so long to pull something
[19444.25s -> 19450.89s]  up uh because i don't have browser capture on by default because every because every time there are
[19450.89s -> 19455.85s]  links that like spammed in the chat and i like have to close them and look when i when i become
[19455.85s -> 19463.53s]  a professional streamer i'm gonna have a completely separate cap device that just pulls a a browser
[19463.53s -> 19467.85s]  window and it's gonna feed into the stream just i've got a i've got to grow up as a streamer a
[19467.85s -> 19474.70s]  little bit and sometimes it takes me a little while okay once i upgrade from a 1080 uh
[19475.34s -> 19480.49s]  graphics card is when i'll start having that easier and plus i don't like i don't want to
[19480.49s -> 19485.82s]  click on random shit just open it it takes me a few a few moments to make sure it's i have this
[19485.82s -> 19491.10s]  is a legal thing to show on stream because i know i've heard of streamers in the past they just open
[19491.10s -> 19496.06s]  up fucking every link that they see or they get sent to and then there's like a dick on screen
[19496.06s -> 19499.66s]  and then there's like uh something horrible or something bad and then they close the window
[19499.66s -> 19502.38s]  real quick and then they get uh yelled at or they get in trouble they get banned

[20756.66s -> 20761.30s]  ever made in the last like seven years has been the worst game i've ever seen last like seven what
[20761.30s -> 20769.74s]  what every other video what am i talking about true i mean like the quality model warfare was
[20769.74s -> 20774.54s]  good it was all right you know black ops is kind of fun every other video game that they've ever
[20774.54s -> 20779.10s]  made in the last like seven years has been the worst game i've ever seen he's backtracking
[20779.74s -> 20783.42s]  look you have to backtrack because somebody gets really angry look if you don't don't you
[20783.42s -> 20787.90s]  know understand like politics and social interaction 101 if you say something that
[20787.90s -> 20793.34s]  you know is going to really piss off a ton of people backtrace it reiterate and say it's my
[20793.34s -> 20799.50s]  opinion but it's not there were some good things that came from that series backtrack backtrace it
[20801.27s -> 20808.17s]  and then put some passive tracing i don't know whatever backtrack that's the
[20808.17s -> 20819.35s]  origination of backtrack where is this crack part i don't care got it but you can be smoking
[20819.43s -> 20823.59s]  crack in your car and i do what they don't give a shit if you're saying an illegal meme though
[20823.59s -> 20827.11s]  you're gonna get pulled over they'll pull you over they'll check your phone they'll they'll make
[20827.11s -> 20830.47s]  they'll check what your browser history to see that they see what like the things you've been
[20830.47s -> 20835.35s]  saying in chat rooms and stuff you could have like a pound of crack in your trunk or literally you
[20835.35s -> 20842.01s]  could be smoking crack in front of the meme officer and he's not his jurisdiction i have no
[20842.01s -> 20847.70s]  idea what that even means but i guess we found it hey anyways let's finish up the stream ending
[20847.70s -> 20853.62s]  here sometimes i feel like another person said this stuff you know what i mean like
[20854.58s -> 20857.70s]  we've talked about we've talked about this before we've talked about this before
[20858.34s -> 20862.26s]  we've talked about this before we've talked about this before we've gone over this before
[20863.30s -> 20866.58s]  we've gone over this before we've gone over this before i've talked about this before we said this
[20866.58s -> 20872.97s]  before i've talked about this before but uh i say a lot of i talk a lot on these streams and it's
[20872.97s -> 20882.90s]  weird to hear a person that i don't even know who that is talking it's weird to hear like a point i
[20882.90s -> 20891.42s]  was trying to make like three years ago i'm like who the fuck is this person anyways hey
[20893.02s -> 20898.70s]  thanks for the 500 bits mf doom is to the rap game as germa is to the internet that's
[20899.74s -> 20903.50s]  you have a wide meme reach but it still feels like for some reason you're the internet's biggest
[20903.50s -> 20908.46s]  inside joke in a very good way something i've observed deserve more clout for the effort you
[20908.54s -> 20921.06s]  put into your content um i don't know i feel like it i don't even i know it's like really this is
[20921.06s -> 20925.30s]  cliche for me to say this and i know it's i'm gonna say it and people are gonna be like i'm
[20925.30s -> 20930.58s]  gonna hear your eyes roll into the back of your fucking head you're gonna hit the back of your
