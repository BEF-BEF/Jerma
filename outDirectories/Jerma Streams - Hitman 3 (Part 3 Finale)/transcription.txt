[0.76s -> 4.90s]  Is it $359? Pretty cool. What's up?
[4.90s -> 11.40s]  Clap, clap. One time on time Andy.
[15.08s -> 25.59s]  One time on time Andy. Did I add that?
[25.59s -> 26.87s]  How are you guys doing? Hope you're doing well.
[28.58s -> 32.02s]  Uh, just let me make a tweet and we can get started. Give me one sec.
[32.02s -> 64.97s]  Okay. Neanderthal is playing the power wash simulator.
[66.25s -> 70.46s]  I saw that. Yeah. Does it suck?
[74.10s -> 78.74s]  Is it a shitty game? Or is it good?
[80.49s -> 84.92s]  Gonna have to get a little review here.
[84.92s -> 88.30s]  Are you going to try the don't starve mod? Wait, what?
[88.86s -> 95.13s]  Why did you have sub only mode on you fucking? What?
[95.69s -> 98.38s]  What are you talking about? Yesterday?
[101.94s -> 104.58s]  What? I can't turn on sub only? I already explained it.
[105.14s -> 108.47s]  Did that person wait of 24 hours to say that?
[111.69s -> 114.17s]  That must have been in your text box.
[115.72s -> 118.04s]  You ever text somebody and you just kind of give up halfway through?
[119.62s -> 122.26s]  Like three or four days go by and you like open up your
[122.26s -> 124.98s]  that person's message and you go, oh fuck, I was going to write this. Enter.
[125.78s -> 132.15s]  You must've just done that. Yes, I did.
[134.54s -> 137.50s]  Did you? That's so funny. No, no way.
[137.50s -> 138.62s]  Do you have like a tab open?
[143.30s -> 150.54s]  Jerma, please. Jerma, please sing me a song, please.
[151.42s -> 153.53s]  No, not everybody gets a song.
[158.14s -> 161.26s]  On time, Andy, a billion off the debt.
[161.98s -> 164.50s]  That would be pretty cool, actually.
[165.38s -> 166.34s]  I should have done it.
[167.24s -> 170.66s]  God damn it. Yesterday, I should have said,
[172.09s -> 178.73s]  hey, today, by the way, if I get exactly 359 live, it's a billion off the debt.
[178.73s -> 182.04s]  Oh, well. Missed my opportunity.
[187.34s -> 188.30s]  No deal? Well, that's all right.
[188.86s -> 191.13s]  Today, we're going to finish Hitman 3 today.
[191.85s -> 195.70s]  I have, I think, two more missions, but one more real mission.
[196.42s -> 199.38s]  And then like a finale or something, from my understanding.
[200.10s -> 202.70s]  You're late.
[206.54s -> 211.22s]  Shitman 3. Sing the Hitman 3 song.
[211.22s -> 222.18s]  It's all about songs with you guys, isn't it?
[222.18s -> 223.70s]  It's all about songs.
[225.05s -> 226.65s]  Everything has a song now.
[227.29s -> 229.38s]  Jerma, sing the tooth brushing song.
[229.38s -> 230.82s]  Well, that's a very important one
[231.46s -> 233.06s]  because you need to brush your teeth for two minutes.
[234.92s -> 237.16s]  So, I mean, I would do that one for you.
[243.42s -> 244.54s]  Let me get the lyrics for it.
[245.18s -> 247.35s]  So use this for when you're brushing your teeth, okay?
[257.22s -> 261.54s]  Here we go. Brush.
[261.54s -> 263.38s]  Start it now. It has to last two minutes.
[266.02s -> 268.82s]  Very important that you listen to this while you brush.
[270.54s -> 273.10s]  Brush, brushy, brush, brushy, brush, brush.
[273.74s -> 276.14s]  Brush, brushy, brush, brushy, brush, brush.
[276.14s -> 278.14s]  Brushy, brush them up and down.
[278.14s -> 280.78s]  Brushy, brush, brush them round and round.
[280.78s -> 283.26s]  To keep teeth healthy, here's the truth.
[283.26s -> 286.30s]  You gotta brush each and every single tooth.
[286.30s -> 288.70s]  The teeth in the back get a lot of wear.
[288.70s -> 290.70s]  So don't forget to wash back there.
[291.26s -> 294.62s]  Brush, brushy, brush, brushy, brush, brush, brush your teeth.
[294.62s -> 295.90s]  Keep them looking clean and neat.
[296.62s -> 298.78s]  Brush, brushy, brush, brush, brush, brush.
[298.78s -> 301.42s]  Brush your teeth every day and night.
[301.42s -> 303.42s]  Now your toothpaste may taste good
[303.98s -> 305.58s]  when you've got it in your mouth.
[306.14s -> 307.66s]  Elmo, that's not right.
[307.66s -> 309.42s]  That doesn't, that's, toothpaste sucks.
[309.42s -> 310.86s]  But you should never swallow it.
[310.86s -> 312.22s]  You gotta spit it out.
[312.22s -> 313.34s]  Go on and spit.
[313.34s -> 314.38s]  We'll wait it out.
[315.02s -> 315.82s]  Brush your teeth.
[315.82s -> 317.34s]  Keep them looking clean and bright.
[317.34s -> 318.86s]  Brush, brushy, brush, brush.
[318.86s -> 319.90s]  That's all right.
[319.90s -> 321.98s]  Brush, brush, brush every day and night.
[322.62s -> 325.74s]  Now if your parents heard, here's what you've gotta do.
[325.74s -> 326.86s]  Let them get your toothbrush
[326.86s -> 328.70s]  so they can brushy brush your teeth.
[328.70s -> 329.42s]  Great job.
[329.42s -> 330.94s]  Looks like you're almost done.
[330.94s -> 331.44s]  What?
[332.22s -> 335.50s]  Five, four, three, two, one.
[335.50s -> 336.22s]  Now spit.
[337.26s -> 340.57s]  That song's terrible.
[340.57s -> 344.25s]  That's like Elmo's teeth brushing song.
[344.25s -> 344.97s]  That song sucks.
[350.84s -> 355.40s]  Anyways, get your, wait, if your parents hear you,
[355.40s -> 356.76s]  get them to brush your teeth for you?
[357.64s -> 358.92s]  That's the end of the song, Elmo.
[360.07s -> 363.85s]  That's at the third, that's the final third of the song.
[365.58s -> 366.54s]  Two minutes.
[366.54s -> 369.66s]  Elmo, you have the parent line be the first two lines.
[370.30s -> 374.39s]  You just plagiarized Sesame Street.
[378.66s -> 380.18s]  Yeah, what, let's go.
[384.06s -> 385.02s]  Plagiarize.
[385.02s -> 386.54s]  I didn't plagiarize Sesame Street.
[386.54s -> 389.34s]  I just told you I was reading you something from Sesame Street.
[389.98s -> 398.58s]  I mean, I was giving you the source.
[398.58s -> 399.46s]  That's the source.
[400.18s -> 408.41s]  Plagiarizing means I pretended that I just made that song up
[408.41s -> 416.68s]  and I didn't take it from Elmo.
[416.68s -> 419.53s]  Today, oh no, yesterday, okay.
[419.53s -> 420.17s]  All right, so here we go.
[420.49s -> 422.41s]  We're in the final of real level of Hitman.
[423.56s -> 424.36s]  If you, you know what?
[424.36s -> 424.84s]  You know what?
[424.84s -> 426.68s]  Let's just, for the people that weren't here yesterday,
[426.68s -> 429.16s]  like let's, what am I, just skip till I get to,
[429.16s -> 431.16s]  no, we're gonna just restart the level
[431.16s -> 432.71s]  so people can know what's going on.
[434.42s -> 434.82s]  Here you go.
[435.46s -> 436.98s]  I want you to know what happened.
[437.62s -> 441.45s]  We're gonna just start it from the beginning.
[441.45s -> 446.18s]  Everything's planned, everything's good.
[446.18s -> 447.06s]  Yep, that's perfect.
[447.94s -> 448.50s]  And let's go.
[449.06s -> 452.58s]  Give us a recap.
[452.58s -> 453.94s]  We're meeting Diana.
[453.94s -> 455.62s]  You know, 47, this is Diana.
[455.62s -> 458.79s]  We're meeting her at a ledge
[458.79s -> 462.98s]  because there's a bad guy that's trying to kill us both.
[462.98s -> 466.34s]  So now we're meeting in an undisclosed location
[466.34s -> 469.78s]  so we can try to kill that guy and get him
[469.78s -> 471.98s]  because he's trying to get us.
[471.98s -> 474.54s]  And I just explained power is a thing.
[474.54s -> 475.83s]  There you go.
[475.83s -> 478.31s]  Power is a thing and some people grab it.
[478.31s -> 479.99s]  Some people miss their opportunity to grab it
[479.99s -> 481.51s]  and some people reach for it their whole life
[481.51s -> 483.19s]  but it's a thing that you can get.
[483.19s -> 490.25s]  There you go.
[490.25s -> 491.77s]  And for those of you that weren't here yesterday,
[492.78s -> 495.66s]  I'm gonna go ahead and do the exact same job I did last night.
[495.74s -> 497.50s]  I just killed Diana with one shot.
[497.50s -> 498.54s]  I killed her.
[498.54s -> 500.38s]  She's still alive.
[500.38s -> 502.30s]  Well, that person's dead instead.
[502.30s -> 503.26s]  I think I can still do it.
[504.06s -> 511.77s]  All right, but if you weren't here yesterday,
[511.77s -> 516.04s]  we're gonna start with that one.
[516.04s -> 517.00s]  All right, so it doesn't matter.
[517.00s -> 518.28s]  No, wait, no, you wanna see the beginning.
[518.84s -> 520.74s]  No, don't replan the mission.
[524.15s -> 525.75s]  It took so many.
[525.75s -> 528.15s]  Oh, fuck, this dude's out of material.
[528.15s -> 529.19s]  No, I just started.
[529.19s -> 537.99s]  Give me a second.
[537.99s -> 539.43s]  Hold on, what's going on here?
[539.43s -> 540.07s]  We've got a link.
[541.67s -> 545.14s]  Oh, is this a link spam day today?
[545.14s -> 546.66s]  What the fuck?
[546.66s -> 550.31s]  This is a fucking paragraph, dude.
[550.31s -> 554.49s]  This is like an essay.
[555.05s -> 555.53s]  Hold on.
[558.86s -> 559.74s]  I'm gonna read this.
[573.72s -> 575.08s]  Um, what the hell?
[575.08s -> 586.04s]  Okay, so, um, okay.
[586.04s -> 589.48s]  Jeremy, this is your principal from Clown High speaking,
[589.48s -> 590.52s]  Principal Bubbles.
[590.52s -> 591.80s]  Hi, Principal Bubbles.
[591.80s -> 593.32s]  I've been watching your Hitman 3 streams
[593.32s -> 595.08s]  and I've been very underwhelmed.
[595.08s -> 598.28s]  Okay, I know you can do better than zero stars every mission,
[598.28s -> 599.80s]  so I want to cut you a deal.
[599.80s -> 602.50s]  For this next mission, the score you get at the end
[602.50s -> 604.26s]  in the detailed score tab
[604.26s -> 606.82s]  is how much I would like to remove from your debt
[606.82s -> 608.49s]  times 100.
[608.49s -> 611.21s]  However, you kill one innocent man
[611.21s -> 614.17s]  and get even one point of a negative score.
[614.17s -> 615.37s]  The money you receive is null
[615.37s -> 616.89s]  and instead we will add to your debt
[616.89s -> 620.89s]  the amount that was penalized also times 100.
[620.89s -> 624.44s]  Loading a save if you have to is fine,
[624.44s -> 626.97s]  but no blatant save's coming.
[626.97s -> 629.45s]  We trust that you'll be a good person, Mr. Albertson.
[629.45s -> 631.45s]  You always were the best in the clown class.
[632.01s -> 633.05s]  If you accept,
[633.05s -> 636.01s]  you can also choose to double or triple the rewards
[636.01s -> 637.77s]  and penalties from the bet.
[637.77s -> 638.81s]  We believe in you,
[638.81s -> 642.38s]  valedictorian of the clown class of 2004.
[642.38s -> 643.98s]  Thank you, Principal Bubbles.
[643.98s -> 647.99s]  And I really wish I didn't get suspended that time
[647.99s -> 650.15s]  that I squirted the water in your face
[650.15s -> 653.03s]  with the flour on my blouse.
[653.03s -> 655.98s]  But, and I, everyone laughed at that but you,
[655.98s -> 657.93s]  and I got suspended.
[657.93s -> 660.41s]  So, I mean, you're gonna cut me a deal here, that's fine.
[660.41s -> 663.06s]  Is that a deal?
[663.06s -> 667.26s]  All right, I have to be very, very honest with everybody here.
[667.26s -> 672.86s]  This is, this is the truth, the absolute truth.
[672.86s -> 676.23s]  I've played every single Hitman, all of them.
[676.23s -> 679.30s]  Contracts, Blood Money, Hitman 1, Hitman 2,
[679.30s -> 681.51s]  the Hitman Absolution,
[681.51s -> 684.39s]  the new reimagining of this last trilogy here,
[684.39s -> 687.59s]  Hitman, Hitman 2, Hitman 3 here.
[687.59s -> 693.48s]  I have, I don't think ever, not one time ever,
[693.48s -> 698.20s]  in two decades, gotten more than zero stars on a mission.
[698.20s -> 703.43s]  I've gotten more than, I've never gotten more than zero
[703.43s -> 706.81s]  in two decades of playing this game, this franchise.
[706.81s -> 711.08s]  I don't even know how to properly play this game.
[711.08s -> 713.72s]  I don't even understand it.
[713.72s -> 718.30s]  So, that's a very bad deal for me to take, very bad.
[723.37s -> 725.26s]  I don't know if I can do it.
[725.26s -> 727.42s]  You're talking about a one in a million chance
[727.42s -> 728.46s]  that I will get this right.
[728.46s -> 730.14s]  I've played every single one of these
[730.14s -> 733.74s]  and I end up having to like throw a guy over a balcony
[733.74s -> 736.46s]  or like shoot some lady because she was in the way.
[736.46s -> 738.04s]  It's gonna happen.
[738.04s -> 739.40s]  It's not easy for me.
[739.40s -> 740.28s]  Should I do it?
[740.28s -> 742.94s]  But okay, what, times 100?
[747.06s -> 749.27s]  All right, let me ask you a question.
[749.27s -> 755.10s]  Can I do, can I get a save file
[755.10s -> 757.34s]  where I save and I can go to that save
[757.34s -> 758.78s]  and just like fucking throw a grenade?
[758.78s -> 759.50s]  Like, can I do that?
[759.50s -> 764.82s]  Like, can I take it out of my system
[764.82s -> 767.22s]  or do I have to just do it from now on
[767.22s -> 768.50s]  and do good on the mission?
[768.50s -> 772.12s]  Like, can I have like a comedy save file
[772.12s -> 773.88s]  and then like the regular save file?
[773.88s -> 779.30s]  No, it's from now on.
[779.30s -> 781.88s]  You get a comedy save, okay?
[781.88s -> 787.37s]  So, I get one comedy save.
[787.37s -> 788.41s]  All jokes are allowed.
[788.41s -> 789.53s]  This seems very elaborate.
[789.53s -> 791.45s]  We need to have a consensus here.
[791.45s -> 795.56s]  You have to say it's a comedy save.
[795.56s -> 800.20s]  So, like if I say this is a comedy save
[800.20s -> 802.52s]  I'm making right now, I can throw a grenade at somebody.
[802.52s -> 807.46s]  Do we have a, I'm allowed one comedy save
[807.46s -> 809.98s]  for this whole mission.
[809.98s -> 817.96s]  Okay, yes.
[817.96s -> 819.64s]  Yes, one comedy save.
[819.64s -> 820.68s]  Unfunny stream.
[820.68s -> 821.88s]  Wait, I just started.
[823.19s -> 824.15s]  Come on, dude.
[824.97s -> 825.85s]  What the fuck?
[827.08s -> 828.84s]  I haven't even started.
[828.84s -> 834.92s]  I'm like blocking out a deal.
[834.92s -> 836.28s]  Like, cause now, here's the thing.
[836.28s -> 838.12s]  Now a lot of you guys are concerned now
[838.12s -> 840.12s]  because now I'm not gonna just throw grenades at people.
[840.12s -> 841.40s]  I'm not gonna throw people to balconies
[841.40s -> 842.76s]  and I'm not gonna like trap somebody
[842.76s -> 845.64s]  like in like the kitchen and throw plates at them.
[845.64s -> 847.48s]  Now you're like, oh shit, this is the gaming.
[847.48s -> 849.96s]  He's gonna be like gaming on this stream.
[849.96s -> 852.04s]  Only 13% of the people from the census
[852.04s -> 853.48s]  even wanted this in the first place.
[853.48s -> 854.60s]  I'm going for it.
[854.60s -> 856.52s]  Let's go.
[856.52s -> 858.44s]  I accept the agreement.
[858.44s -> 860.12s]  I get one comedy save.
[860.12s -> 863.14s]  I get one comedy save.
[863.14s -> 865.67s]  And the rest is I have to play Hitman.
[865.67s -> 869.27s]  I'm gonna make, I'm gonna do the best I possibly fucking can.
[869.27s -> 872.12s]  And that's how times 100 at the end
[872.12s -> 874.52s]  is the hardest I'm ever gonna try in a video game.
[874.52s -> 878.47s]  All right, does it go, can I get it?
[878.47s -> 879.75s]  Let me get something out of my, should I?
[880.31s -> 882.68s]  Is it not starting now?
[882.68s -> 883.72s]  Is it starting now?
[883.72s -> 887.93s]  Is it starting right now?
[887.93s -> 890.09s]  But wait, this doesn't count as a comedy save, right?
[890.09s -> 891.54s]  Put that away.
[891.54s -> 892.10s]  Not right now.
[892.10s -> 893.86s]  Not right, can I start right now?
[893.86s -> 897.00s]  Not yet.
[897.00s -> 897.56s]  Doesn't start yet.
[897.56s -> 898.36s]  When does it start?
[898.36s -> 899.88s]  When can I, when does it actually start?
[899.88s -> 901.67s]  It starts right now.
[901.67s -> 902.15s]  Okay, right now.
[902.15s -> 903.11s]  All right, all right, all right.
[903.11s -> 907.43s]  I want to throw off so bad.
[907.43s -> 910.46s]  I want to push her over the edge so bad.
[910.46s -> 911.10s]  You got my message.
[911.10s -> 912.22s]  I have one comedy save.
[912.22s -> 913.10s]  I have to make it count.
[913.10s -> 920.58s]  Put the face cam on or no deal.
[920.58s -> 920.90s]  That doesn't-
[920.90s -> 923.06s]  I'm not the only one who's been busy, 47.
[923.06s -> 928.18s]  Okay, we already saw that.
[928.18s -> 930.33s]  You need, there has to be a face cam for this.
[930.33s -> 930.49s]  Why?
[930.49s -> 932.89s]  You know, I don't have to prove I'm looking at the screen.
[932.89s -> 935.93s]  Why do I have to prove that I'm looking at the screen for?
[935.93s -> 944.82s]  Or it's pre-recorded?
[944.82s -> 948.60s]  Don't get out of here.
[948.60s -> 949.48s]  Okay, fine.
[949.48s -> 959.24s]  Or you could be doing a walkthrough.
[964.90s -> 967.38s]  Okay, it's times a hundred, right?
[974.31s -> 975.83s]  All right, I'm going to try really fucking hard.
[978.15s -> 980.23s]  Eliminate Tamara.
[980.23s -> 981.99s]  Eliminate Dawn Archibald.
[981.99s -> 984.31s]  Do not eliminate Diana Burnwood
[984.31s -> 987.03s]  unless you make a comedy save file right now.
[987.03s -> 989.99s]  Too early.
[989.99s -> 991.13s]  Let's go.
[991.13s -> 998.52s]  Put the guy with the camera.
[998.52s -> 1005.83s]  Put the guy with the camera.
[1005.83s -> 1007.11s]  This is not a comedy save.
[1007.11s -> 1007.75s]  All right.
[1007.75s -> 1009.91s]  Slot one is regular save.
[1009.91s -> 1010.71s]  Slot two-
[1010.71s -> 1013.53s]  Can I have three comedy saves, please?
[1013.53s -> 1018.79s]  Can I please have three comedy save files?
[1018.79s -> 1019.35s]  Three-
[1019.35s -> 1027.35s]  One is not enough.
[1027.35s -> 1029.91s]  Three.
[1029.91s -> 1031.56s]  Okay.
[1031.56s -> 1032.28s]  Why are you asking?
[1032.28s -> 1034.23s]  It's your stream.
[1034.23s -> 1034.63s]  Right.
[1034.63s -> 1035.11s]  That's right.
[1035.11s -> 1035.83s]  I get three comedy-
[1035.83s -> 1036.47s]  Okay.
[1036.47s -> 1038.31s]  I get three comedy save files.
[1038.31s -> 1039.43s]  This is regular save file.
[1039.43s -> 1040.63s]  This is comedy save slot.
[1040.63s -> 1041.43s]  I get three.
[1041.43s -> 1050.33s]  Oh, damn it.
[1050.33s -> 1050.89s]  Like, okay.
[1050.89s -> 1051.37s]  You know what?
[1053.00s -> 1054.94s]  Soldier 76.
[1054.94s -> 1056.70s]  Right now, like, the visor came down,
[1056.70s -> 1057.10s]  and it's like,
[1057.10s -> 1059.58s]  Soldier 76, I got you in my sights.
[1059.58s -> 1061.22s]  And it's like-
[1061.22s -> 1061.94s]  Everybody's lighting up,
[1061.94s -> 1062.50s]  and I'm just like, which one?
[1062.50s -> 1062.90s]  Who do I-
[1062.90s -> 1063.46s]  I need to-
[1063.46s -> 1064.74s]  I gotta throw that guy in the front of the car.
[1066.81s -> 1067.77s]  I'm seeing so many-
[1067.77s -> 1068.41s]  I wanna, like, just-
[1068.41s -> 1069.05s]  I don't know what to do.
[1078.07s -> 1079.27s]  The person's smoking a cigarette.
[1079.27s -> 1081.11s]  Like, I wanna throw a cigarette at them.
[1082.58s -> 1082.98s]  Cell phone.
[1082.98s -> 1084.02s]  Smack cell phone out of his hand.
[1086.28s -> 1086.84s]  Walk through-
[1086.84s -> 1088.12s]  Just barrel through the crowd.
[1088.12s -> 1088.92s]  Shoulders.
[1088.92s -> 1089.42s]  Okay.
[1092.66s -> 1092.98s]  You know what?
[1092.98s -> 1094.34s]  I can, like, pretend I'm doing it.
[1098.68s -> 1099.32s]  I didn't do anything.
[1102.46s -> 1102.78s]  Okay.
[1102.78s -> 1103.18s]  Visitors.
[1103.18s -> 1103.58s]  Here we go.
[1104.22s -> 1105.93s]  I'm gonna start to pay attention,
[1105.93s -> 1106.49s]  because I need to-
[1106.49s -> 1107.53s]  I need to get a good score.
[1110.46s -> 1110.78s]  Okay.
[1115.80s -> 1116.76s]  You know-
[1116.76s -> 1119.70s]  Can I disguise as one of those guys?
[1120.42s -> 1125.22s]  Eliminate them-
[1125.22s -> 1125.94s]  But where are they?
[1126.66s -> 1127.78s]  Inside there, up there.
[1128.50s -> 1130.34s]  Oh, I wanna get in front of the-
[1130.34s -> 1132.42s]  I wanna pretend like I'm the singer of the band.
[1133.14s -> 1134.90s]  This is not gonna deduct points.
[1134.90s -> 1136.02s]  I can still do things like that.
[1148.39s -> 1152.71s]  Okay, I don't understand.
[1157.27s -> 1158.31s]  I did not understand any of that.
[1158.31s -> 1158.71s]  I'm sorry.
[1166.20s -> 1167.00s]  What about in here?
[1168.14s -> 1170.14s]  Do not eliminate Diana Burnwood.
[1170.14s -> 1171.26s]  Well, that's so easy.
[1171.26s -> 1171.82s]  She's-
[1171.82s -> 1173.58s]  Oh, she's coming to the party.
[1176.57s -> 1177.61s]  She's gonna stand.
[1180.06s -> 1180.38s]  She's-
[1180.38s -> 1186.65s]  Hey there.
[1186.65s -> 1187.61s]  Can I dance with her?
[1190.01s -> 1190.97s]  May I have this dance?
[1195.46s -> 1196.58s]  Oh, okay.
[1196.58s -> 1198.10s]  Are we gonna work together?
[1198.10s -> 1198.82s]  Oh, I know.
[1198.82s -> 1203.56s]  Excuse me.
[1203.64s -> 1204.12s]  May I-
[1204.12s -> 1204.84s]  May I button?
[1212.10s -> 1212.66s]  Excuse me.
[1212.66s -> 1213.46s]  May I button?
[1218.02s -> 1218.66s]  How can I tell-
[1218.66s -> 1219.54s]  No, I'm gonna cue.
[1229.26s -> 1229.74s]  Is this-
[1229.74s -> 1230.24s]  Okay.
[1233.02s -> 1233.42s]  Is that me?
[1242.06s -> 1243.26s]  I'm gonna disguise as that guy.
[1247.83s -> 1250.23s]  I would laugh so hard if she just turned to me when I pressed F1,
[1250.23s -> 1251.59s]  like her head just turns and she's like,
[1251.59s -> 1252.95s]  47, we have a new lead.
[1269.72s -> 1270.44s]  Okay.
[1270.44s -> 1271.08s]  Well, cool.
[1276.82s -> 1277.06s]  Okay.
[1280.34s -> 1280.66s]  Okay.
[1291.29s -> 1293.61s]  Oh, if I push her over the edge, it won't kill her, but it'll be funny.
[1298.06s -> 1300.38s]  Imagine just like a somersault over the railing.
[1302.62s -> 1303.10s]  This is a-
[1303.10s -> 1304.38s]  This is a gamer save, by the way.
[1304.38s -> 1305.34s]  I want to make that really clear.
[1310.63s -> 1311.83s]  This is-
[1311.83s -> 1313.51s]  They're playing music really loudly.
[1313.51s -> 1314.15s]  All right, what do we got?
[1314.15s -> 1314.55s]  Let's see.
[1314.55s -> 1315.27s]  Mission stories.
[1316.07s -> 1319.35s]  Eyes on the target, over the top, or the tour.
[1319.35s -> 1320.31s]  I want to do the tour.
[1326.73s -> 1328.09s]  The guy they were talking about is over here.
[1328.89s -> 1329.85s]  Turn down the music.
[1330.41s -> 1337.87s]  Better?
[1342.49s -> 1343.29s]  Turn it up.
[1343.29s -> 1347.56s]  All right, wait, wine bottle.
[1348.12s -> 1349.08s]  Let me get the wine bottle.
[1349.64s -> 1353.02s]  It's not illegal, right?
[1353.58s -> 1355.34s]  Oh my god, I can bottle somebody.
[1367.91s -> 1376.71s]  Me?
[1378.39s -> 1379.35s]  That's like me, but British.
[1383.35s -> 1384.47s]  All right, go sign in.
[1384.47s -> 1387.83s]  AKA get bottled in the bathroom, and then get your costume taken.
[1402.46s -> 1403.90s]  Wait.
[1408.46s -> 1410.14s]  The whole time I'm staring at them.
[1411.83s -> 1414.23s]  Oh, we can't get them to say that again.
[1415.03s -> 1417.48s]  We can't get them to say that again.
[1417.48s -> 1417.96s]  Too bad.
[1418.52s -> 1424.18s]  Skies yourself is Corvo Black.
[1436.81s -> 1437.29s]  Here we go.
[1439.14s -> 1440.42s]  Remember, this is a gamer save.
[1448.60s -> 1449.96s]  Don't kill anybody, that's important.
[1461.35s -> 1462.15s]  Kill them all, kill them.
[1462.15s -> 1464.15s]  I don't understand a 50-50 chance of getting caught.
[1464.15s -> 1466.63s]  I mean, you do realize the risk here, boss.
[1467.35s -> 1469.58s]  Brought the workers around.
[1469.58s -> 1471.58s]  Who would send me in this world?
[1471.58s -> 1473.26s]  Why does this chat suck so much?
[1473.98s -> 1475.26s]  I didn't say it, you did.
[1478.01s -> 1480.17s]  But if I'm going to be one of these heralds.
[1480.17s -> 1481.13s]  I didn't say that.
[1484.79s -> 1485.59s]  Oh, QR code.
[1486.39s -> 1487.35s]  Scan it with my camera.
[1492.82s -> 1493.38s]  What is that?
[1493.38s -> 1493.88s]  Cool.
[1497.46s -> 1500.74s]  Nero Yates features a spectacular dining patio
[1500.74s -> 1502.66s]  on top of their winemaking facility.
[1502.66s -> 1502.98s]  Cool.
[1506.52s -> 1507.56s]  We hate one guy.
[1507.56s -> 1508.06s]  What?
[1508.60s -> 1517.62s]  This is rude.
[1517.62s -> 1518.18s]  What's rude?
[1518.90s -> 1520.50s]  This is a terrible link.
[1520.50s -> 1521.78s]  I keep seeing terrible link.
[1529.02s -> 1530.86s]  I need to...
[1530.86s -> 1532.38s]  Okay, this guy's about to be alone.
[1532.38s -> 1533.50s]  Okay, this is important.
[1533.50s -> 1534.38s]  I don't want to fuck this up.
[1535.10s -> 1537.48s]  He's coming over here.
[1537.48s -> 1538.92s]  He is alone.
[1538.92s -> 1539.64s]  He's alone.
[1540.28s -> 1542.36s]  Diana.
[1542.36s -> 1546.04s]  Diana, just like scream really loud right now.
[1546.04s -> 1547.64s]  And when everyone runs over be like,
[1547.64s -> 1549.64s]  oh, I'm sorry, there was a bug on my face.
[1550.60s -> 1551.40s]  Give me a hand here.
[1552.04s -> 1564.97s]  Hey, I couldn't do it.
[1564.97s -> 1565.45s]  I couldn't do it.
[1565.45s -> 1566.09s]  I couldn't do it.
[1566.09s -> 1566.73s]  I couldn't do it.
[1566.73s -> 1567.21s]  I couldn't do it.
[1567.21s -> 1567.69s]  I couldn't do it.
[1567.69s -> 1568.89s]  I didn't save scum.
[1568.89s -> 1570.09s]  That's not a safe scum.
[1570.09s -> 1571.13s]  That was me completely...
[1571.13s -> 1571.77s]  I couldn't do it.
[1571.77s -> 1572.65s]  I couldn't do it.
[1580.07s -> 1580.39s]  Fuck!
[1580.39s -> 1595.35s]  Why is he mad at me?
[1595.35s -> 1595.67s]  Fuck!
[1595.67s -> 1596.31s]  I can't do it.
[1600.76s -> 1602.28s]  There's another opportunity right here.
[1602.84s -> 1607.22s]  If he turns around, I have to kill him.
[1612.25s -> 1616.73s]  Fuck!
[1616.73s -> 1617.93s]  I can't kill that guy.
[1646.97s -> 1647.69s]  Ahh!
[1647.69s -> 1651.46s]  Okay, I can't do it.
[1651.46s -> 1651.86s]  I can't do it.
[1651.86s -> 1652.50s]  It's impossible.
[1652.50s -> 1654.02s]  I can't play it man like this.
[1654.02s -> 1654.90s]  It's impossible.
[1654.90s -> 1656.34s]  It's literally impossible.
[1656.34s -> 1656.90s]  It's invo-
[1656.90s -> 1657.94s]  It's literally impossible.
[1657.94s -> 1659.22s]  It's impossible to play a game like this.
[1659.22s -> 1659.78s]  It's impossible.
[1659.78s -> 1660.10s]  I lose.
[1660.10s -> 1665.61s]  Somebody should call an exorcist.
[1665.61s -> 1666.41s]  Cancel the deal.
[1666.41s -> 1666.81s]  Cancel it.
[1667.69s -> 1668.73s]  Alright, this is this.
[1668.73s -> 1669.45s]  Cancel the deal.
[1669.45s -> 1670.09s]  Cancel the deal.
[1670.09s -> 1670.57s]  I can't do it.
[1671.21s -> 1672.34s]  Cancel the deal.
[1672.34s -> 1672.82s]  Cancel it.
[1674.34s -> 1675.30s]  Cancel the deal right now.
[1675.30s -> 1676.26s]  It's not gonna happen.
[1676.26s -> 1677.78s]  I guarantee it won't happen.
[1677.78s -> 1680.02s]  The deal is off.
[1680.02s -> 1687.98s]  Just not gonna fucking happen.
[1687.98s -> 1690.92s]  Load the save.
[1690.92s -> 1691.40s]  I'm not li-
[1691.40s -> 1692.28s]  I can't save scum.
[1692.28s -> 1694.36s]  And right there, I would have had to kill like four people.
[1695.08s -> 1699.26s]  Add a dollar to the debt.
[1699.26s -> 1703.61s]  It's dead.
[1703.61s -> 1704.65s]  Okay, well, you know what?
[1704.65s -> 1704.97s]  That's fine.
[1704.97s -> 1706.01s]  That's minus 50,000 points.
[1706.01s -> 1706.49s]  I don't even care.
[1712.82s -> 1715.02s]  The deal is off.
[1715.02s -> 1715.66s]  You know what?
[1715.66s -> 1716.62s]  You have this.
[1716.62s -> 1717.42s]  You can add-
[1717.42s -> 1721.82s]  You can add 50,000 dollars for every minute that we had that deal going before I canceled it.
[1741.59s -> 1741.99s]  Why?
[1741.99s -> 1742.71s]  That's not that much.
[1743.43s -> 1744.79s]  That's like two million.
[1744.79s -> 1746.60s]  How much is that?
[1746.60s -> 1751.70s]  It's 1.5 million.
[1751.70s -> 1763.19s]  I said 50,000 for every minute.
[1763.19s -> 1763.91s]  It's been like-
[1763.91s -> 1765.43s]  It's been like two minutes.
[1765.43s -> 1765.99s]  Twelve minutes.
[1766.63s -> 1767.48s]  What's this guy-
[1767.48s -> 1767.88s]  What's-
[1767.88s -> 1768.28s]  Why is-
[1768.28s -> 1769.32s]  What happened to this guy?
[1769.32s -> 1769.96s]  Why are you puking?
[1772.04s -> 1773.32s]  Why did I do that?
[1773.32s -> 1784.90s]  Who's searching?
[1784.90s -> 1789.53s]  Okay, we're gonna go up.
[1789.53s -> 1794.84s]  Let's get-
[1794.84s -> 1795.48s]  Let's take the tour.
[1798.34s -> 1799.62s]  That guy tripped.
[1808.62s -> 1809.58s]  Actual maniac.
[1812.10s -> 1815.54s]  Again, I will say it again for all the people that were not here a few days ago.
[1818.94s -> 1822.78s]  Playing GTA V but following all the rules and the traffic signals
[1823.64s -> 1825.96s]  is how Hitman is supposed to be played.
[1825.96s -> 1826.60s]  I can't do that.
[1840.76s -> 1844.36s]  If I'm driving the car in GTA and this is like-
[1844.36s -> 1845.88s]  I'm just gonna get out of the car and I'm gonna punch someone.
[1846.44s -> 1848.84s]  And then I'm gonna get back in the car and go back to normal and do the mission.
[1854.22s -> 1855.26s]  Body f-
[1855.26s -> 1856.06s]  He's naked.
[1857.34s -> 1862.57s]  Let's go start the tour.
[1870.81s -> 1876.50s]  Dream is actually not ironically fucked.
[1877.22s -> 1878.54s]  Dream.
[1878.54s -> 1879.42s]  Ooh, this is beautiful.
[1880.14s -> 1889.85s]  How was my day?
[1889.85s -> 1890.33s]  It was pretty good.
[1890.89s -> 1891.45s]  How was yours?
[1902.62s -> 1903.66s]  Your 1080 is dying.
[1905.82s -> 1906.46s]  Don't hold your breath.
[1906.46s -> 1906.86s]  Don't worry.
[1906.86s -> 1907.98s]  I'm getting a new computer.
[1907.98s -> 1909.10s]  Vidal is a true believer.
[1909.10s -> 1910.46s]  It's just this shit's hard to get right now.
[1910.46s -> 1911.18s]  He's loyal to the cops.
[1911.18s -> 1913.94s]  Must be why he chose her to show Burnwood-
[1913.94s -> 1915.38s]  Sorry, that like fucks with me in real life.
[1920.15s -> 1920.63s]  All right, here we go.
[1920.63s -> 1921.59s]  Let's join the other guests.
[1921.59s -> 1922.31s]  Here comes the tour.
[1925.64s -> 1926.20s]  Here.
[1926.20s -> 1929.00s]  You two must be Burnwood and Vidal.
[1929.00s -> 1931.56s]  And you must be Yates' garbage man.
[1931.56s -> 1936.87s]  Sorry, but I didn't catch your name.
[1936.87s -> 1938.87s]  This is Corvo Black, Tamara.
[1938.87s -> 1939.37s]  It's me.
[1940.07s -> 1941.35s]  I see a regular.
[1941.35s -> 1943.11s]  I only work with the best.
[1943.11s -> 1945.27s]  Well, we're all here it seems.
[1945.27s -> 1947.35s]  Except for our guide, the chief winemaker.
[1947.99s -> 1950.15s]  Looks like we're stuck here until someone fetches him.
[1951.03s -> 1953.99s]  Mr. Black, I'm looking in your direction.
[1953.99s -> 1954.49s]  Hold on.
[1955.11s -> 1956.39s]  I'll track him down.
[1956.39s -> 1956.89s]  Where is he?
[1957.51s -> 1959.11s]  We try and bring him back in one piece.
[1959.11s -> 1960.71s]  Infiltrate the grape fields?
[1961.91s -> 1963.27s]  That was a bit rude.
[1963.27s -> 1963.77s]  Yes.
[1964.47s -> 1965.99s]  Infiltrate the grape fields.
[1966.63s -> 1970.50s]  Why didn't I just say go get the guy?
[1970.50s -> 1971.94s]  Infiltrate the grape fields.
[1971.94s -> 1972.44s]  Okay.
[1977.43s -> 1978.98s]  We're supposed to be on the tour.
[1979.70s -> 1981.54s]  What the fuck is this?
[1987.46s -> 1988.26s]  Oh dear.
[1988.26s -> 1988.76s]  Okay.
[1995.46s -> 1996.82s]  Oh my god!
[1996.82s -> 1998.62s]  All right, I'm fine.
[1999.34s -> 2001.27s]  I got a coin here.
[2001.91s -> 2007.02s]  No, don't look over here.
[2007.02s -> 2007.58s]  Look over there.
[2016.54s -> 2017.10s]  Into the barrel?
[2017.90s -> 2018.40s]  Okay.
[2018.40s -> 2019.10s]  Hang out right here.
[2020.86s -> 2021.36s]  Puncture.
[2024.31s -> 2029.35s]  Doi doi doi.
[2037.48s -> 2038.36s]  I'm like a bird.
[2038.36s -> 2039.88s]  You just do certain calls, I'll call back.
[2047.16s -> 2054.76s]  I love Malbec.
[2063.70s -> 2064.34s]  Three grapes.
[2065.06s -> 2084.68s]  Excuse me.
[2085.14s -> 2089.28s]  Excuse me.
[2089.98s -> 2091.50s]  Dave scum.
[2091.50s -> 2092.14s]  The deal is off.
[2092.14s -> 2092.70s]  It doesn't matter.
[2092.70s -> 2093.74s]  There's no way I was going to do that.
[2093.74s -> 2094.86s]  You knew that was not going to happen.
[2095.66s -> 2097.00s]  It just wasn't.
[2097.00s -> 2099.40s]  It just that was that was not possibly going to happen.
[2109.58s -> 2110.08s]  Wait, what?
[2110.62s -> 2114.82s]  Why is he not investigating?
[2115.46s -> 2145.58s]  Is it a wood chipper?
[2146.46s -> 2147.26s]  What is that?
[2147.26s -> 2148.78s]  I'm not going to grind this guy's body up, right?
[2149.34s -> 2150.15s]  What?
[2150.15s -> 2150.71s]  You what?
[2150.71s -> 2151.03s]  What?
[2151.03s -> 2151.35s]  Why?
[2151.35s -> 2152.31s]  You can what?
[2152.31s -> 2162.49s]  Oh, here it is.
[2162.49s -> 2163.13s]  The skies.
[2163.69s -> 2209.58s]  I'm going to do the same exact thing I did last time.
[2209.58s -> 2215.58s]  You guys walk by.
[2215.58s -> 2215.90s]  Ready?
[2215.90s -> 2216.46s]  Check this out.
[2217.10s -> 2218.30s]  Two guards walk by.
[2218.30s -> 2219.98s]  I can't believe I ground that guy up.
[2220.78s -> 2223.34s]  Where are the two guards?
[2223.34s -> 2223.90s]  There they are.
[2228.42s -> 2252.79s]  Oh, I thought if I went the other way it'd be safer.
[2252.79s -> 2269.32s]  Read the objective.
[2269.32s -> 2271.88s]  Discard yourself as a winery worker.
[2273.78s -> 2276.76s]  Not the winery worker.
[2277.32s -> 2278.60s]  A winery worker.
[2284.25s -> 2285.53s]  A winery worker.
[2285.53s -> 2287.85s]  Not this winery worker.
[2287.85s -> 2290.01s]  Not that winery worker.
[2290.89s -> 2291.77s]  A winery.
[2291.77s -> 2292.49s]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[2292.49s -> 2293.93s]  He's the one with the fucking blue thing on it.
[2293.93s -> 2294.49s]  I'm taking him.
[2317.77s -> 2320.89s]  Acquire a grape picking knife.
[2320.89s -> 2321.69s]  Thread him.
[2321.69s -> 2327.11s]  No, I'm not going to shred this guy.
[2327.11s -> 2328.87s]  So that's so much money.
[2330.78s -> 2334.54s]  That's so much money from Freddy Dredd.
[2334.54s -> 2340.60s]  Freddy Dredd giving just millions of community subs at this point.
[2340.60s -> 2341.80s]  I'm a thousandth.
[2341.80s -> 2342.58s]  Thanks, Freddy.
[2342.58s -> 2343.86s]  That's 69 community subs.
[2343.86s -> 2344.50s]  Holy shit.
[2345.22s -> 2348.71s]  All right.
[2348.71s -> 2349.51s]  I need a knife.
[2349.51s -> 2349.99s]  Thank you.
[2349.99s -> 2351.99s]  That's people have given a shitload of money.
[2351.99s -> 2352.23s]  I...
[2355.06s -> 2355.78s]  Thanks, guys.
[2355.78s -> 2356.74s]  I don't even know what to do.
[2356.74s -> 2357.46s]  I don't know what to say.
[2357.46s -> 2358.50s]  This is so much money.
[2358.50s -> 2359.22s]  Does it give somebody?
[2359.78s -> 2361.93s]  You guys, a bunch of you.
[2364.95s -> 2366.15s]  Our benefactors.
[2366.95s -> 2368.90s]  All right.
[2368.90s -> 2370.10s]  I need a grape picking knife.
[2370.74s -> 2375.99s]  Oh, this guy.
[2375.99s -> 2377.27s]  These guys can see through my disguise.
[2377.91s -> 2378.71s]  Holy shit.
[2378.71s -> 2380.31s]  I just accidentally did this correctly.
[2381.03s -> 2390.22s]  Harvest three ripe Malbec grape vines.
[2390.22s -> 2394.57s]  Oh my God.
[2394.57s -> 2395.61s]  Is he crying?
[2395.61s -> 2404.92s]  What?
[2404.92s -> 2405.24s]  Yes.
[2405.80s -> 2408.01s]  Orders confirmed.
[2408.57s -> 2412.04s]  I will.
[2412.60s -> 2418.22s]  Just like the blue.
[2418.94s -> 2424.49s]  Okay.
[2424.49s -> 2426.81s]  Harvest three Malbec grapes.
[2427.37s -> 2436.82s]  Are these Malbec grapes?
[2440.28s -> 2440.92s]  No.
[2440.92s -> 2441.40s]  Oh, they are.
[2441.40s -> 2441.64s]  Okay.
[2444.66s -> 2445.22s]  These are big.
[2445.94s -> 2448.63s]  Harvest two ripe Malbec grapes.
[2449.27s -> 2454.60s]  Why would I have to sneak around doing this?
[2455.16s -> 2464.14s]  I think I have to distract this guy.
[2464.78s -> 2470.66s]  Here's the mission agent 985.
[2479.98s -> 2480.22s]  No.
[2481.35s -> 2481.99s]  Anisoto.
[2482.87s -> 2485.51s]  Why don't you just open this thing up and pick some grapes out of here?
[2486.23s -> 2492.34s]  I need there.
[2492.34s -> 2493.22s]  Is that one right there?
[2493.22s -> 2493.46s]  All right.
[2493.46s -> 2494.02s]  This one.
[2494.02s -> 2495.62s]  They look like beehives.
[2495.62s -> 2495.78s]  All right.
[2495.78s -> 2496.18s]  Here we go.
[2496.18s -> 2496.42s]  Ready?
[2496.98s -> 2498.86s]  What was that over there?
[2504.23s -> 2509.85s]  Oh, easy, easy, easy.
[2510.49s -> 2512.42s]  I don't know what to turn that on.
[2512.42s -> 2517.74s]  There's one this way.
[2519.35s -> 2520.39s]  Investigating distraction.
[2520.39s -> 2520.63s]  Good.
[2521.19s -> 2523.72s]  There's one right here.
[2523.72s -> 2523.96s]  Wait.
[2523.96s -> 2525.00s]  Is anybody looking this way?
[2525.00s -> 2525.32s]  Nope.
[2525.32s -> 2525.80s]  Okay.
[2525.80s -> 2526.92s]  What about this way?
[2526.92s -> 2527.24s]  Nope.
[2527.24s -> 2527.48s]  Go.
[2528.20s -> 2530.02s]  Last one.
[2530.50s -> 2532.25s]  Thank you.
[2532.25s -> 2536.18s]  Deliver the grapes to the chef.
[2536.66s -> 2537.96s]  Sure thing.
[2537.96s -> 2543.72s]  I heard.
[2543.72s -> 2547.14s]  I don't know why.
[2547.14s -> 2547.94s]  The grape chef.
[2548.66s -> 2550.26s]  We're going to give it to the grape chef.
[2577.58s -> 2581.22s]  This is why I don't do face cam because I end up going like this.
[2581.86s -> 2585.06s]  You know what they need to make?
[2585.78s -> 2588.02s]  They need to make a device that you put around your neck
[2588.02s -> 2590.10s]  to make it so you can't move your neck forward.
[2590.58s -> 2596.15s]  Would you guys get one of those if it was like a posture neck thing?
[2596.15s -> 2597.67s]  That like it was like a thing around your neck
[2597.67s -> 2599.83s]  and there was like a thing here that like went.
[2599.83s -> 2602.15s]  I know you just saw my fucking armpit hair and it's too long.
[2603.11s -> 2604.63s]  His armpit hair is way too long.
[2604.63s -> 2606.47s]  Does he do any manscaping?
[2606.47s -> 2608.39s]  All the time, but not recently because I've been busy.
[2609.43s -> 2613.51s]  So anyways, I've got a thing around the neck
[2613.51s -> 2614.95s]  that connects to the back of the chair.
[2614.95s -> 2625.13s]  So it's like because I always go like this and one is like that's all right.
[2625.13s -> 2630.15s]  That's that's just a chain.
[2630.15s -> 2633.77s]  No, I don't want that.
[2633.77s -> 2635.29s]  The gamer posture.
[2636.49s -> 2641.69s]  The gamer posture corrector is just like a a fucking like neck brace.
[2641.69s -> 2642.73s]  That whole like a chain.
[2643.61s -> 2655.59s]  If you would get so excited or like a big kill or something.
[2655.59s -> 2657.83s]  If you're sitting there like playing like fucking Fortnite.
[2657.83s -> 2661.11s]  Just like come on, come on, come on, come on, one more.
[2661.11s -> 2662.47s]  Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, come on, come on.
[2665.26s -> 2666.38s]  Oh, right, right.
[2666.38s -> 2666.88s]  Okay.
[2667.98s -> 2669.02s]  Victory Royale.
[2669.58s -> 2670.14s]  I did it.
[2670.78s -> 2676.95s]  Wait, so I gotta save it.
[2681.78s -> 2682.90s]  Game leash.
[2682.90s -> 2685.91s]  I have to hand it to him.
[2690.70s -> 2691.20s]  Fine.
[2692.87s -> 2697.80s]  Are we going to try it?
[2697.80s -> 2703.19s]  Is he's going to squish it in his hands like into this cup and I'm going to try it?
[2705.27s -> 2709.72s]  That's a 10.
[2713.29s -> 2713.79s]  That's a 10.
[2719.77s -> 2720.89s]  What if you had to go to the bathroom?
[2722.65s -> 2724.01s]  Do you have like the key right here?
[2724.73s -> 2728.98s]  Disguise yourself as Corvo Black.
[2736.14s -> 2739.18s]  I have the keys and there's just the key to this thing sitting here.
[2739.18s -> 2740.30s]  What if I drop it on the ground?
[2740.86s -> 2744.71s]  What if it's just like, okay, that was awesome.
[2744.71s -> 2746.87s]  I got two Victory Royales in a row.
[2747.43s -> 2748.55s]  Let me just get that key.
[2761.18s -> 2763.90s]  No, let me just get my phone.
[2764.70s -> 2765.88s]  My phone.
[2766.76s -> 2769.32s]  Oh boy, that's the phone on the ground.
[2770.28s -> 2786.31s]  I don't want to start screaming in that.
[2786.31s -> 2787.99s]  Well, I don't have access to my hands.
[2789.13s -> 2791.61s]  Why am I like strapped to the chair?
[2792.33s -> 2797.77s]  So not only do I have like the gamer like nerd neck preventer,
[2797.77s -> 2800.49s]  I also apparently have my arms taped to the chair.
[2800.49s -> 2803.66s]  I don't know why that's why.
[2803.66s -> 2806.46s]  Why am I like reaching like this to try to get the phone?
[2806.46s -> 2826.70s]  If you're going to see me do this, just in case somebody does, I'm saving it right here.
[2826.70s -> 2827.20s]  Okay, good.
[2827.90s -> 2828.94s]  I'm now trespassing.
[2828.94s -> 2830.14s]  All right, because I'm a different person.
[2831.26s -> 2831.82s]  Top the fence.
[2832.38s -> 2837.16s]  We're good.
[2837.16s -> 2842.15s]  Oh my god, German.
[2842.15s -> 2843.35s]  Look what Neanderthal is playing.
[2843.35s -> 2843.99s]  Oh yeah, I saw.
[2844.55s -> 2846.95s]  Power wash simulator.
[2846.95s -> 2848.39s]  I wonder if it's the game of the year.
[2860.23s -> 2861.03s]  All right, let's save it here.
[2861.59s -> 2864.07s]  I feel like I'm going to have a lot of opportunity to just be stupid.
[2867.75s -> 2868.87s]  This is not even a guy I have to kill.
[2874.97s -> 2876.01s]  This is not even the target.
[2879.45s -> 2882.89s]  Every time I hear Diana talk, I just think she's not here.
[2882.89s -> 2885.69s]  I just hear, I just hear like she's in a beer piece.
[2895.06s -> 2896.18s]  The production floor.
[2896.74s -> 2898.34s]  Graves are processed.
[2898.34s -> 2903.54s]  We insist on the steaming every grape by hand, which means that during harvest season,
[2903.54s -> 2905.62s]  the grapes do tend to pile up.
[2905.62s -> 2907.66s]  Plenty of sauce.
[2907.66s -> 2908.70s]  Is this how it actually works?
[2908.70s -> 2910.86s]  Our equipment is a state of the art.
[2910.86s -> 2913.32s]  Industrial sized freezer unit.
[2915.32s -> 2917.96s]  They bring the, I thought, I thought they just like froze them.
[2921.80s -> 2923.00s]  I can't pretend with that one.
[2923.00s -> 2925.24s]  I know how wine, I know how wine is made.
[2926.14s -> 2929.42s]  I can't like, I can't like make a fucking stupid bit how I like don't know what they do.
[2929.58s -> 2930.14s]  I know what they do.
[2930.14s -> 2931.50s]  They crush them and they squish them.
[2935.11s -> 2938.23s]  I can't pretend like, oh, they freeze them and then they put them in like the squisher.
[2939.11s -> 2940.55s]  I'm not going to even go down that road today.
[2944.63s -> 2947.11s]  Farm farming like question marks.
[2950.28s -> 2950.84s]  Oh, cool.
[2950.84s -> 2952.28s]  The McDonald's play place bar.
[2952.28s -> 2952.84s]  I love this.
[2954.04s -> 2954.52s]  Hold on.
[2969.38s -> 2974.10s]  Using our grape presser for the longer secondary stage of fermentation.
[2977.46s -> 2978.26s]  Ask questions.
[2978.26s -> 2978.76s]  Okay.
[2984.38s -> 2984.88s]  Yes.
[2987.82s -> 2992.30s]  Are they allowed, are we allowed to taste the grapes during the production process?
[3006.76s -> 3007.26s]  Wait.
[3012.60s -> 3013.24s]  What was it?
[3013.24s -> 3015.08s]  Wait, is it a squisher?
[3026.44s -> 3026.94s]  Yeah.
[3036.42s -> 3036.92s]  Press it.
[3037.62s -> 3038.50s]  Press the button right now.
[3039.56s -> 3041.80s]  Let's see if I can Indiana Jones get out of this in time.
[3047.77s -> 3048.27s]  Okay, cool.
[3049.05s -> 3052.41s]  Wait, what do you unlock safety mechanism?
[3057.03s -> 3058.15s]  Wait, I can squish them.
[3067.56s -> 3068.28s]  Who has a key?
[3069.45s -> 3070.33s]  Save, save, save.
[3077.11s -> 3078.15s]  Oh, I think he's just.
[3084.28s -> 3084.92s]  I need a key.
[3093.13s -> 3094.81s]  Oh, somebody pressed the button and squished her.
[3095.45s -> 3110.81s]  You have a lock pick.
[3116.30s -> 3117.34s]  It's why it's grayed out.
[3118.06s -> 3121.58s]  Who has the key?
[3122.46s -> 3123.59s]  One of these guys have a key.
[3129.34s -> 3131.58s]  I can't believe you would stand in this for more than one second.
[3131.58s -> 3133.42s]  I would, I would never even stand in it.
[3133.42s -> 3134.30s]  I'll take a picture.
[3135.18s -> 3139.82s]  The thing that that is designed to only fucking squish and crush things.
[3140.38s -> 3142.94s]  You're going to stand underneath that for a fucking tourist photo.
[3145.66s -> 3146.70s]  What are you talking about?
[3152.89s -> 3153.37s]  Wait, hold on.
[3153.37s -> 3154.01s]  We got to go up here.
[3154.65s -> 3161.11s]  Put the lock pick in your hand.
[3161.75s -> 3165.67s]  Wait, I have a key hacker.
[3166.31s -> 3167.27s]  Does that do anything?
[3167.99s -> 3172.74s]  Somebody said Willy Wonka joke incoming.
[3172.74s -> 3175.06s]  Did you just spoil a potential joke that I was going to make?
[3175.70s -> 3177.62s]  And I didn't even know I was going to make it until right now.
[3178.42s -> 3182.39s]  What the fuck, man?
[3187.75s -> 3188.47s]  Oh, come on.
[3190.79s -> 3195.16s]  Unbelievable.
[3195.96s -> 3196.60s]  Unbelievable.
[3201.08s -> 3202.52s]  Augustus, you're getting too close.
[3204.28s -> 3205.64s]  I love chocolate.
[3205.64s -> 3206.44s]  I was going to do that.
[3210.25s -> 3211.13s]  That was a wrong person.
[3211.77s -> 3215.64s]  That was Diana.
[3225.54s -> 3227.78s]  Why did you ruin that for me?
[3227.78s -> 3229.38s]  You've ruined that for me.
[3231.11s -> 3232.47s]  I didn't know that's what this was.
[3232.47s -> 3235.43s]  And I was about to, I could have done like an Augustus bit
[3235.43s -> 3237.59s]  where I dumped Augustus in there.
[3237.59s -> 3238.31s]  Well, not dumped.
[3238.31s -> 3238.71s]  I don't.
[3238.71s -> 3242.07s]  But like, I get that pretend like Augustus gets stuck in the pipe.
[3247.91s -> 3248.39s]  Down from there.
[3253.05s -> 3254.25s]  Don't do it, Diana.
[3256.89s -> 3258.33s]  Diana, don't do it.
[3271.45s -> 3272.25s]  Almost.
[3274.41s -> 3275.62s]  That was very close.
[3276.82s -> 3285.29s]  Standing on it with high heels.
[3285.29s -> 3285.53s]  Yeah.
[3286.17s -> 3307.54s]  I can't dump her in here?
[3315.72s -> 3316.84s]  Okay, but wait.
[3316.84s -> 3318.84s]  What happens when she doesn't come back to the door?
[3322.92s -> 3324.04s]  Cassie had diarrhea.
[3324.04s -> 3324.68s]  She had to leave.
[3342.23s -> 3343.19s]  There's a third option.
[3343.83s -> 3376.65s]  I'm just gonna say it.
[3377.21s -> 3378.25s]  That's what all of us are thinking.
[3379.48s -> 3381.40s]  If this was on Steam, this wouldn't happen.
[3381.40s -> 3385.91s]  Because it didn't.
[3386.55s -> 3404.22s]  It did happen.
[3404.22s -> 3406.65s]  This is on the fucking Nintendo Store.
[3406.65s -> 3407.29s]  This wouldn't happen.
[3422.09s -> 3423.13s]  I didn't just pick my nose.
[3423.13s -> 3424.33s]  I went like this.
[3424.33s -> 3429.11s]  That's the worst one.
[3429.11s -> 3432.02s]  Okay, error.
[3432.66s -> 3434.50s]  Unable to load the requested menu.
[3438.33s -> 3438.73s]  Oh, okay.
[3438.73s -> 3439.85s]  I'm gonna...
[3439.85s -> 3441.29s]  Here's another thing all of us are thinking.
[3441.93s -> 3443.21s]  Unable to load the requested menu.
[3443.21s -> 3447.29s]  Please retry the quest or contact Hitman support if this is a problem.
[3447.29s -> 3449.61s]  How many people are looking at those emails coming in?
[3452.22s -> 3455.66s]  Contact Hitman support about how I lost connection.
[3458.28s -> 3464.20s]  There's an inbox somewhere with like 40,000 unread emails saying,
[3464.20s -> 3468.23s]  hey, my server doesn't work.
[3485.70s -> 3486.10s]  Call them.
[3486.58s -> 3487.30s]  It's not a number.
[3487.30s -> 3488.98s]  It's like a support email.
[3489.78s -> 3498.71s]  Can I not even load the game now?
[3499.51s -> 3502.22s]  What the heck?
[3502.78s -> 3509.90s]  What the heck?
[3509.90s -> 3511.10s]  The bar is loading.
[3511.10s -> 3513.02s]  You can't see it, but it's going very slow.
[3513.66s -> 3520.20s]  Somebody said, the game stinks.
[3522.55s -> 3523.51s]  I'm just gonna hard reset.
[3523.51s -> 3524.55s]  I hope I don't lose save.
[3526.54s -> 3543.06s]  Do a hard destroy.
[3543.06s -> 3545.22s]  Good thing it cloud synced the game files.
[3546.02s -> 3559.86s]  What mods should you get for Oblivion?
[3561.10s -> 3564.73s]  Um, are you...
[3564.73s -> 3565.21s]  Never mind.
[3581.50s -> 3583.74s]  I am required to play online,
[3583.74s -> 3586.46s]  but you are not required to make sure it works.
[3587.26s -> 3592.12s]  Yes.
[3592.12s -> 3599.62s]  Let's go!
[3599.62s -> 3616.20s]  Don't do it again.
[3616.20s -> 3617.98s]  Don't do it again.
[3617.98s -> 3619.50s]  I'm gonna be very upset if it does it again.
[3620.38s -> 3621.02s]  Thank God.
[3624.38s -> 3624.94s]  All right, so...
[3633.42s -> 3634.30s]  There's a third option.
[3634.30s -> 3634.78s]  I want to see it.
[3637.90s -> 3639.50s]  What is the comedy part of the stream?
[3639.50s -> 3641.82s]  Well, stay tuned.
[3642.86s -> 3646.22s]  Stay tuned when we do the next, um, like, mouse trap.
[3652.95s -> 3653.75s]  We'll push him in.
[3660.31s -> 3661.50s]  Can I have this?
[3662.30s -> 3667.58s]  All right.
[3667.58s -> 3669.26s]  I want to see the, uh, the last one.
[3669.90s -> 3672.46s]  It was the third one.
[3673.02s -> 3682.02s]  Where's this last one?
[3682.66s -> 3687.61s]  How would he hear me from all the way over here?
[3688.41s -> 3691.62s]  We've never heard 47 raise his voice.
[3697.08s -> 3698.12s]  Has he ever screamed?
[3701.38s -> 3702.18s]  I mean, all right.
[3702.18s -> 3702.50s]  Come on.
[3702.50s -> 3703.38s]  Like, give me a break.
[3703.38s -> 3703.88s]  Really?
[3707.75s -> 3712.98s]  Like, what can you tell me about the grape crusher?
[3715.85s -> 3718.89s]  Well, it crushes things.
[3723.62s -> 3724.50s]  Hold on.
[3724.50s -> 3725.54s]  Does it kind of crush anything?
[3747.13s -> 3748.41s]  You're gonna see me do this, though.
[3749.05s -> 3751.42s]  Had any workplace accidents?
[3751.42s -> 3754.63s]  Well, fall into the bath and get crushed to a pulp.
[3755.27s -> 3757.96s]  You'd have to be a bona fide idiot.
[3757.96s -> 3759.48s]  Waste of space if you ask me.
[3760.44s -> 3764.28s]  Yes, well, fortunately, we have had none of that.
[3764.28s -> 3765.96s]  So if there's no further questions...
[3765.96s -> 3767.16s]  He's gonna put on some music?
[3770.09s -> 3771.37s]  What about that guy?
[3771.37s -> 3783.58s]  That's fucking disgusting.
[3784.14s -> 3791.06s]  What happened to your calling?
[3791.06s -> 3792.02s]  I should call.
[3792.02s -> 3792.82s]  Something about work.
[3794.41s -> 3795.13s]  What happened?
[3796.17s -> 3797.37s]  Hey, what happened to the calling?
[3800.09s -> 3801.61s]  Looks like a little deep red.
[3801.61s -> 3802.81s]  A little deeper than usual.
[3803.69s -> 3808.17s]  You know what's the funniest part about that?
[3808.17s -> 3809.05s]  I throw in a wrench.
[3809.05s -> 3810.17s]  Everybody screams.
[3810.17s -> 3814.18s]  I throw a person in there who screams and makes way more noise.
[3814.18s -> 3815.14s]  Nobody gives a shit.
[3821.96s -> 3823.96s]  Have to be a bona fide idiot.
[3824.84s -> 3827.45s]  That was fucking awesome.
[3828.09s -> 3832.38s]  Remember, this is fucked up.
[3832.38s -> 3833.42s]  It's a hit man.
[3833.42s -> 3837.26s]  You kill people and you grind them up and you throw them off the ocean and shit.
[3837.98s -> 3842.79s]  This is not Yoshi's Woolly World.
[3842.79s -> 3843.75s]  This is Hitman.
[3843.75s -> 3846.39s]  You grind people up and do it into like a meat grinder.
[3857.27s -> 3863.74s]  Oh, I just tried to close the door on him.
[3868.62s -> 3869.99s]  Well, this motherfucker's right here.
[3873.51s -> 3875.58s]  Can I like throw that guy in the meat grinder?
[3879.08s -> 3884.92s]  Is he in the barrel?
[3887.56s -> 3889.72s]  To make sure the wine is good, he stays in there?
[3891.08s -> 3892.68s]  He is what makes it so delicious?
[3893.48s -> 3901.08s]  The secure wine fridge next to the barrel room contains the vineyard's most precious wines,
[3901.08s -> 3903.96s]  but the access doors which are made from ballistic glass can only be unlocked
[3903.96s -> 3906.20s]  from a terminal in the upstairs security room.
[3910.31s -> 3911.59s]  Oh, it's not a real barrel.
[3915.11s -> 3917.48s]  Ah, Ms. Burnwood.
[3917.48s -> 3918.52s]  Don Yates.
[3918.52s -> 3919.24s]  Pleased to meet you.
[3919.80s -> 3921.56s]  You come very highly recommended.
[3922.12s -> 3925.64s]  As chief of the heralds, let me be the first to say welcome aboard.
[3925.64s -> 3927.56s]  Why, thank you, Mr. Yates.
[3927.56s -> 3933.00s]  Rest assured that I will be following your every lead very closely.
[3933.00s -> 3935.24s]  Say, that reminds me.
[3935.24s -> 3938.68s]  We're about to have a little herald get together up the house.
[3938.68s -> 3939.40s]  We are.
[3939.40s -> 3943.40s]  Modest toast to celebrate my forthcoming inauguration is constant.
[3944.04s -> 3945.48s]  You are, of course, most welcome.
[3945.48s -> 3948.47s]  I believe you shall make a fine.
[3948.47s -> 3949.11s]  I believe?
[3950.31s -> 3951.43s]  Take the black.
[3951.43s -> 3953.96s]  I wouldn't miss it for the world.
[3953.96s -> 3955.96s]  Capital, right this way.
[3955.96s -> 3956.52s]  Into the...
[3956.52s -> 3961.27s]  Why don't you take a break, Corvo?
[3961.27s -> 3963.75s]  We're done here for now, I think.
[3963.75s -> 3965.43s]  Oh, but don't go too far.
[3965.43s -> 3967.27s]  I may still need your services later.
[3967.27s -> 3969.27s]  I'll be closer than you think.
[3969.27s -> 3971.27s]  Oh, almost forgotten.
[3971.27s -> 3971.99s]  What is it?
[3971.99s -> 3975.83s]  Please nip down to the wine cellar and tell Mr. Flowers, the sommelier,
[3975.83s -> 3980.23s]  to prep the 1945 grand paladin and bring it up to the house.
[3980.23s -> 3980.87s]  That's code.
[3980.87s -> 3982.23s]  For our special occasion.
[3982.23s -> 3983.35s]  1945 grand paladin.
[3983.35s -> 3984.39s]  That's like a bazooka.
[3985.48s -> 3988.60s]  Make sure to get the bazooka ready to fire it when they start to come into the front door.
[3989.16s -> 3997.13s]  What's going on?
[3997.13s -> 3997.85s]  Intel.
[3997.85s -> 4005.75s]  There he is.
[4005.75s -> 4006.07s]  Okay.
[4007.03s -> 4007.43s]  Intel.
[4007.43s -> 4028.20s]  Mr. Flowers, Mr. Yates wants the 1945 grand paladin brought up to the house.
[4028.20s -> 4029.00s]  I have my orders.
[4029.00s -> 4029.64s]  Special occasion.
[4029.64s -> 4030.60s]  You have to follow.
[4030.60s -> 4039.66s]  Have the ghosts of Jesus, John Lennon, and Eva Perrone unexpectedly come for dinner?
[4041.86s -> 4044.42s]  What could possibly be so special?
[4044.82s -> 4046.50s]  Above your clearance, Flowers.
[4046.50s -> 4047.86s]  Just fetch it already.
[4047.86s -> 4048.18s]  Fine.
[4049.06s -> 4050.98s]  What's the passcode again?
[4050.98s -> 4052.42s]  Last year of World War II.
[4053.14s -> 4054.74s]  If you have to look it up, shame on you.
[4059.53s -> 4064.98s]  Last year of...1945? 1946?
[4068.87s -> 4072.47s]  Yates has invited the heralds to a small gathering in his wine cellar,
[4072.47s -> 4075.11s]  celebration of his upcoming inauguration as the new constant.
[4075.75s -> 4078.63s]  Likely, Yates wants to make a good impression with his future team,
[4079.27s -> 4081.67s]  but he hadn't expected the team to include Diana Burnwood.
[4082.31s -> 4082.79s]  That's me.
[4083.35s -> 4098.07s]  Disguise yourself as a sommelier.
[4098.07s -> 4106.65s]  How do I get in there?
[4110.33s -> 4110.81s]  Wait.
[4110.81s -> 4111.53s]  Security camera.
[4112.09s -> 4115.45s]  Can I take a photo of it?
[4116.01s -> 4116.97s]  Can I open this somehow?
[4121.19s -> 4122.07s]  Shoot the glass.
[4122.07s -> 4123.91s]  I'm not gonna shoot the fucking glass.
[4135.37s -> 4136.25s]  Punch the glass.
[4136.97s -> 4141.62s]  Can I go in here?
[4143.67s -> 4144.47s]  Turn the tap.
[4151.58s -> 4152.70s]  Tap on the glass.
[4152.70s -> 4153.50s]  No, that's not gonna work.
[4154.22s -> 4161.80s]  Can I do something with this?
[4161.80s -> 4162.68s]  Can I open it like this?
[4163.48s -> 4163.72s]  No.
[4164.28s -> 4167.53s]  Nothing I can do about this.
[4167.53s -> 4168.49s]  Is there a place I can go?
[4170.10s -> 4171.14s]  Maybe I should just like...
[4171.14s -> 4171.62s]  Hold on.
[4171.62s -> 4173.30s]  Maybe I should just tap on the glass.
[4173.30s -> 4177.27s]  What's the worst that could happen?
[4177.27s -> 4179.51s]  I like drop a bottle and they come and say, what's wrong?
[4180.31s -> 4181.72s]  I'm gonna tap on the glass.
[4186.01s -> 4187.13s]  That's a bomb!
[4188.01s -> 4192.73s]  I thought that was a coin.
[4193.29s -> 4198.46s]  I thought it was a coin.
[4199.10s -> 4201.26s]  Oops.
[4202.06s -> 4204.73s]  Let me take a piss.
[4204.73s -> 4205.69s]  I'll be right back.
[4205.69s -> 4385.30s]  Goku?
[4385.30s -> 4387.86s]  Well, let me ask you a question, Goku.
[4387.86s -> 4388.34s]  I can't do it.
[4388.34s -> 4388.90s]  I just ate food.
[4388.90s -> 4389.62s]  I can't.
[4389.62s -> 4389.94s]  Hold on.
[4390.58s -> 4395.61s]  Well, I can't believe it, Goku.
[4395.61s -> 4398.23s]  No, I just had like a piece of beef jerky.
[4398.23s -> 4399.51s]  So like it's kind of still going down.
[4399.51s -> 4399.99s]  I can't do it.
[4399.99s -> 4402.47s]  I need full empty throat to be able to do that.
[4407.51s -> 4408.87s]  I kind of sound like a little different.
[4408.87s -> 4410.87s]  It's because like the idea...
[4410.87s -> 4413.75s]  I had two beef jerky sticks and they're still going down.
[4413.75s -> 4415.51s]  I need full complete empty pathway.
[4418.87s -> 4419.75s]  I'm like crying.
[4423.00s -> 4423.56s]  Reality.
[4433.86s -> 4440.06s]  Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry.
[4440.06s -> 4444.82s]  Can I just like cry on stream with like a full cam
[4444.82s -> 4446.66s]  and just wait for somebody to be like, what's going on?
[4446.66s -> 4456.31s]  Just get like water droplets like to wet my fingers
[4456.31s -> 4457.75s]  and like make sure like tears are coming down.
[4457.75s -> 4463.46s]  Just sit there and be going, sure.
[4469.03s -> 4469.99s]  That's like kind of fucked up.
[4469.99s -> 4471.03s]  I don't want to do that.
[4471.03s -> 4472.01s]  What happened?
[4472.01s -> 4472.57s]  Oh, okay.
[4476.81s -> 4479.08s]  1709.
[4485.94s -> 4486.74s]  Shave your head.
[4486.74s -> 4487.22s]  I'm not...
[4487.22s -> 4489.94s]  No, I have it for now and it's staying here until it's gone.
[4491.38s -> 4491.70s]  All right.
[4491.70s -> 4492.82s]  I don't want to be on camera.
[4493.46s -> 4493.70s]  Hold on.
[4493.70s -> 4495.30s]  Let me do the thing where I sit down at the computer
[4495.30s -> 4496.26s]  and I like go like this.
[4496.98s -> 4501.00s]  Okay.
[4501.00s -> 4503.64s]  I have really like watery eyes just in general.
[4504.44s -> 4506.12s]  So if you notice, I go like this a lot.
[4506.84s -> 4509.08s]  And like so if I get like shot from this direction,
[4509.88s -> 4511.72s]  and I'm like kind of doing hard blinks with my eyes
[4511.72s -> 4512.44s]  because they're watery.
[4513.08s -> 4514.52s]  Like that's why I didn't see that guy.
[4514.52s -> 4517.00s]  A lot of people when you go like, oh, how did you not see that?
[4517.00s -> 4517.80s]  I probably went like this.
[4517.80s -> 4519.00s]  I was probably looking this way and I went...
[4519.80s -> 4521.72s]  And somebody showed up right there, right there.
[4521.72s -> 4523.08s]  And I didn't see them and they disappeared.
[4524.28s -> 4525.40s]  I have really watery eyes.
[4525.96s -> 4529.02s]  I just have very...
[4531.14s -> 4531.30s]  All right.
[4531.30s -> 4532.58s]  I need to go upstairs.
[4532.58s -> 4541.62s]  What's this?
[4544.25s -> 4545.05s]  I'm not trespassing.
[4545.05s -> 4546.33s]  I'm like I'm allowed to be here.
[4546.97s -> 4548.98s]  Anything in this room I can...
[4548.98s -> 4549.22s]  Oh, wait.
[4549.22s -> 4549.78s]  This poison.
[4555.46s -> 4556.58s]  Binary worker's key.
[4556.58s -> 4557.14s]  Oh, shit.
[4557.14s -> 4557.38s]  Nice.
[4558.18s -> 4560.12s]  And a tier one access dongle.
[4560.92s -> 4561.64s]  Just sitting out here.
[4562.20s -> 4564.52s]  Key to unlock doors and machinery on the winery production floor.
[4564.52s -> 4564.68s]  Cool.
[4565.80s -> 4568.14s]  PLT sandwich.
[4575.35s -> 4581.10s]  What did he just do?
[4583.46s -> 4584.50s]  Poison that?
[4585.14s -> 4587.75s]  I guess I could disguise as one of these guys.
[4591.37s -> 4592.01s]  Use, sell.
[4598.79s -> 4600.39s]  Should I disguise as one of them?
[4600.39s -> 4606.01s]  Maybe I'll need the outfit.
[4606.01s -> 4620.34s]  I just added some sugar.
[4630.38s -> 4631.66s]  I gotta distract him.
[4631.66s -> 4639.30s]  I could go for some mate right now.
[4639.30s -> 4643.91s]  Somebody said that.
[4650.84s -> 4651.32s]  Mate?
[4651.88s -> 4659.45s]  Mate.
[4659.53s -> 4659.85s]  Okay.
[4661.45s -> 4662.33s]  Let's distract.
[4662.89s -> 4663.93s]  Let's distract them both.
[4669.50s -> 4669.82s]  What?
[4669.82s -> 4670.94s]  I'm just looking back here.
[4672.14s -> 4672.62s]  I'm all right.
[4673.26s -> 4674.52s]  I appreciate your concern.
[4679.13s -> 4680.33s]  You messed up your spine?
[4695.56s -> 4696.12s]  Gamer neck.
[4696.12s -> 4696.52s]  I'm all right.
[4702.60s -> 4703.64s]  Oh, you don't like that either.
[4704.20s -> 4725.96s]  I mean, I'm trying to pause it at the...
[4725.96s -> 4726.44s]  I'm trying to...
[4726.44s -> 4727.88s]  I'm doing that every time.
[4727.88s -> 4730.12s]  And I thought it might get old at this point.
[4730.92s -> 4732.68s]  But it hasn't.
[4732.68s -> 4733.00s]  I don't...
[4733.00s -> 4733.56s]  You know what I mean?
[4733.56s -> 4735.00s]  It still is like funny to me.
[4735.56s -> 4745.75s]  I mean, I could do that.
[4745.75s -> 4746.31s]  This is just...
[4746.31s -> 4747.35s]  This is tried and true.
[4747.43s -> 4748.07s]  Here's the tried...
[4748.07s -> 4748.87s]  Wait, I have grapes.
[4752.12s -> 4752.36s]  Yeah.
[4752.36s -> 4753.40s]  This is tried and true.
[4753.40s -> 4754.52s]  I'm gonna go with tried and true.
[4755.91s -> 4756.87s]  This is how I play.
[4757.51s -> 4759.27s]  I throw something to cause a distraction.
[4759.91s -> 4762.71s]  And then they both turn around.
[4762.71s -> 4763.43s]  They both go over there.
[4763.43s -> 4764.23s]  And then I'm gonna poison.
[4764.79s -> 4774.22s]  Like, yep.
[4793.42s -> 4795.02s]  It's a pretty cool Halloween drink.
[4796.76s -> 4799.40s]  In fact, I'm 95% certain that...
[4800.36s -> 4800.92s]  That was...
[4800.92s -> 4801.96s]  It was in the Doc...
[4801.96s -> 4802.20s]  What?
[4802.20s -> 4803.40s]  Doctor Dreadful commercial.
[4807.83s -> 4810.15s]  I have bubbling disgusting bruise.
[4810.15s -> 4810.39s]  Yeah.
[4811.27s -> 4812.95s]  And I drank it.
[4815.51s -> 4818.63s]  You can even eat brains in my Dr. Dreadful kid science kit.
[4819.27s -> 4826.36s]  You know, I wanted to do Dr. Dreadful on stream.
[4827.08s -> 4829.40s]  But holy shit, it's rare as absolute fuck.
[4830.78s -> 4832.06s]  They don't make that shit really anymore.
[4832.06s -> 4832.78s]  And it's hard to find.
[4833.34s -> 4837.70s]  Wait, get him now.
[4837.70s -> 4838.34s]  Get him right now.
[4838.34s -> 4839.22s]  Get him now.
[4839.22s -> 4840.42s]  No, I wanted to choke him.
[4840.42s -> 4841.78s]  I wanted to choke him.
[4841.78s -> 4842.34s]  I wanted to choke...
[4842.34s -> 4843.06s]  Did anybody hear that?
[4844.92s -> 4845.80s]  No, good.
[4845.80s -> 4860.86s]  Where can I put him when no one's gonna see him?
[4864.63s -> 4865.11s]  Oh, shit.
[4865.11s -> 4865.35s]  Nice.
[4865.35s -> 4865.59s]  Okay.
[4866.31s -> 4867.38s]  All right.
[4867.38s -> 4869.06s]  Where can I put him that no one will see him?
[4869.06s -> 4870.02s]  There's a guy right here.
[4870.66s -> 4871.54s]  Oh, come on.
[4871.62s -> 4877.45s]  Just grind this guy.
[4877.45s -> 4881.85s]  You tell me you want me to drag this guy all the way to the grape crusher and crush him.
[4882.49s -> 4908.92s]  He's gonna be on camera.
[4909.48s -> 4950.78s]  Oh, shit.
[4958.25s -> 4962.07s]  I need to be quiet.
[4962.07s -> 4963.59s]  I need to do it tactically.
[4963.59s -> 4964.55s]  God damn it.
[4964.55s -> 4965.11s]  Fine.
[4965.11s -> 4967.27s]  I'll do it fucking tactically.
[4967.27s -> 4976.86s]  Just kill a guy near the grinder.
[4977.42s -> 4980.86s]  Let me try this one more time.
[4981.67s -> 4983.19s]  Isn't the grinder really far away?
[4987.75s -> 4989.19s]  Grinder is not close.
[4989.19s -> 4990.07s]  It's very far away.
[4990.71s -> 4996.15s]  It's over there.
[4996.71s -> 4999.69s]  Now, hold on.
[5000.41s -> 5002.65s]  It's the fucking video camera.
[5002.65s -> 5003.69s]  Oh, it's this guy.
[5003.69s -> 5004.09s]  Whatever.
[5004.81s -> 5008.12s]  Who is looking at this?
[5008.84s -> 5023.70s]  You're ignoring the link.
[5023.70s -> 5025.22s]  Yeah, I am.
[5026.10s -> 5034.92s]  I am ignoring the link.
[5034.92s -> 5036.38s]  You're right.
[5036.38s -> 5039.16s]  And I'm gonna continue to do so.
[5039.16s -> 5046.02s]  Third time's the charm.
[5046.02s -> 5047.54s]  If I don't get it this time, I'm just gonna move on.
[5049.85s -> 5051.69s]  I have to distract everybody somehow.
[5052.33s -> 5054.95s]  Come on out here.
[5061.05s -> 5061.37s]  Okay.
[5062.01s -> 5063.99s]  I have my special save point right here.
[5064.63s -> 5068.79s]  Put him down.
[5068.79s -> 5069.69s]  Give me a coin.
[5070.33s -> 5071.45s]  All right.
[5071.45s -> 5072.57s]  That's like a fuse cell.
[5072.57s -> 5073.77s]  Let me like throw it or something.
[5073.77s -> 5074.57s]  I have like a bottle.
[5074.57s -> 5075.85s]  Let's throw the bottle over here.
[5076.49s -> 5090.07s]  He's dead.
[5090.07s -> 5090.55s]  I got him.
[5091.19s -> 5094.31s]  I got him.
[5094.31s -> 5099.86s]  Just pretend I ground him up in the grape grinder.
[5099.86s -> 5104.74s]  Does Jerma look down at his keys?
[5104.74s -> 5105.38s]  It's killing me.
[5109.58s -> 5109.82s]  Yes.
[5110.54s -> 5127.11s]  Just grind up everybody.
[5127.11s -> 5129.27s]  I think I want to do like a crazy guy run
[5129.27s -> 5131.03s]  where everybody gets put in the meat grinder.
[5131.75s -> 5133.96s]  I have a save over there, right?
[5134.60s -> 5136.07s]  All right.
[5136.07s -> 5136.47s]  I do.
[5136.47s -> 5140.22s]  Not right now, but eventually.
[5140.22s -> 5143.18s]  When I finish this mission, I want to go back to that save file.
[5143.34s -> 5146.62s]  I want to just put like 50 people into the grinder.
[5146.62s -> 5147.66s]  I want to put the whole...
[5147.66s -> 5149.66s]  I want to put the entire mission in the grinder.
[5149.66s -> 5152.92s]  I want to put every enemy into the meat grinder.
[5152.92s -> 5154.81s]  Oh, that's going to take a long time.
[5157.99s -> 5158.23s]  All right.
[5158.23s -> 5160.71s]  I need to go down this way to disguise as the sommelier.
[5176.66s -> 5177.30s]  And links.
[5181.66s -> 5181.98s]  Maybe.
[5183.06s -> 5184.18s]  Disable the security.
[5184.74s -> 5186.82s]  Enable alarm, temperature controls, ventilator...
[5186.82s -> 5187.06s]  All right.
[5187.06s -> 5188.50s]  Disable security doors.
[5188.50s -> 5197.91s]  Go down.
[5197.91s -> 5198.63s]  Down, down, down, down.
[5198.63s -> 5199.35s]  Go down, down, down, down.
[5199.35s -> 5199.51s]  Hurry.
[5199.51s -> 5200.87s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[5200.87s -> 5218.60s]  I'm trespassing.
[5218.60s -> 5219.48s]  I'm a security guard.
[5220.04s -> 5223.85s]  And we look pretty good for 53.
[5223.85s -> 5225.21s]  That's how old my dad is.
[5225.21s -> 5225.53s]  Thanks.
[5247.69s -> 5248.41s]  I'm going to need these.
[5249.61s -> 5255.66s]  Why do I feel like these have paints?
[5256.38s -> 5261.19s]  The Endo Yates Pinot Noir.
[5261.19s -> 5263.35s]  Inspired by wines from the Au Valley.
[5263.35s -> 5266.87s]  Medium bodied and fruit forward with an aroma of cherries and raspberry.
[5266.87s -> 5268.39s]  Not their most popular.
[5268.39s -> 5269.82s]  This one's not good.
[5276.04s -> 5279.29s]  I don't...
[5279.29s -> 5280.89s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5280.89s -> 5282.65s]  You don't throw the Malbec.
[5282.65s -> 5285.82s]  You throw the Pinot out of here.
[5285.82s -> 5288.06s]  You hold on to the Malbec.
[5291.88s -> 5318.58s]  Now disable the lasers.
[5319.38s -> 5323.74s]  Can I hide this guy somewhere?
[5324.81s -> 5325.37s]  Oh, shit.
[5325.37s -> 5325.93s]  They're coming back.
[5326.57s -> 5338.54s]  I thought this was a disguise as water.
[5343.66s -> 5343.98s]  All right.
[5343.98s -> 5344.46s]  Nine...
[5344.46s -> 5345.98s]  Was it 1945?
[5345.98s -> 5346.62s]  1946?
[5347.34s -> 5354.30s]  1945.
[5356.39s -> 5357.27s]  Can't even read this.
[5363.91s -> 5364.95s]  Wait, this is like the...
[5364.95s -> 5366.31s]  This is the super bottle.
[5366.31s -> 5373.00s]  All right.
[5373.00s -> 5374.28s]  Put them both in here.
[5374.28s -> 5374.52s]  Right?
[5376.28s -> 5377.64s]  We're going to hide these guys.
[5377.64s -> 5379.45s]  I don't think anybody comes in here.
[5380.09s -> 5396.57s]  I need that.
[5396.57s -> 5397.69s]  I need that.
[5397.69s -> 5404.90s]  Drop the shotgun.
[5404.90s -> 5406.74s]  The zombie here has a shotgun.
[5406.74s -> 5414.41s]  Does it matter if the zombie here has a shotgun?
[5414.41s -> 5419.86s]  Does it?
[5419.86s -> 5420.50s]  Fine.
[5420.50s -> 5422.78s]  What else is illegal?
[5422.78s -> 5423.50s]  Fine.
[5424.12s -> 5425.40s]  What else is illegal?
[5425.40s -> 5428.60s]  I mean, this is illegal, but whatever.
[5428.60s -> 5437.26s]  All right, let's go.
[5453.18s -> 5455.82s]  1945 Grand Paladin.
[5455.82s -> 5457.42s]  Chat, shut the fuck up about the pistol.
[5457.42s -> 5457.66s]  What?
[5459.10s -> 5459.74s]  I'm going to get searched.
[5466.12s -> 5468.36s]  Oh, I can't wait till we pour the...
[5468.36s -> 5469.24s]  Wait, he's going to know.
[5469.24s -> 5470.68s]  Doesn't he know his own sommelier?
[5473.99s -> 5475.59s]  Ah, you're a lot bald.
[5475.59s -> 5477.75s]  Balder than you were five to ten minutes ago.
[5478.31s -> 5479.35s]  And you have a different voice.
[5479.99s -> 5481.11s]  And you're jacked.
[5484.92s -> 5486.78s]  I told you that was going to happen.
[5486.78s -> 5487.26s]  Come on.
[5488.36s -> 5488.92s]  Right.
[5488.92s -> 5490.60s]  I told you this shit was going to happen.
[5491.32s -> 5492.44s]  Go get the pistol.
[5492.44s -> 5493.56s]  I'm about to get patted down.
[5494.12s -> 5509.85s]  What?
[5509.85s -> 5511.59s]  Why did I not kill this guy?
[5512.23s -> 5515.19s]  You both just did like a dance routine.
[5519.16s -> 5521.16s]  All right, I guess I'll hide it in the trash.
[5521.16s -> 5523.56s]  I guess I'll hide it in a trash can.
[5523.56s -> 5530.01s]  Like I passed a reflex save.
[5533.24s -> 5534.84s]  Passed a reflex save.
[5535.64s -> 5543.03s]  Oh, well, the good thing is the trash can here.
[5543.75s -> 5546.98s]  Won't this explode?
[5548.09s -> 5549.05s]  I can't place that.
[5566.98s -> 5568.34s]  I can't put this down.
[5569.30s -> 5570.66s]  I can't put this down.
[5570.66s -> 5571.38s]  I have to put...
[5571.38s -> 5573.22s]  I have to throw it somewhere where no one's going to touch it.
[5573.94s -> 5578.55s]  I have to put it somewhere where no one is going to walk by it.
[5578.55s -> 5583.96s]  It's proximity.
[5583.96s -> 5585.64s]  I know, but I can't have it on me.
[5597.37s -> 5598.73s]  Gently place an item down.
[5598.73s -> 5599.21s]  You can.
[5599.21s -> 5601.29s]  Yeah, but somebody's going to walk by here.
[5601.93s -> 5609.13s]  It's fucking armed.
[5609.13s -> 5609.63s]  Okay.
[5610.09s -> 5618.54s]  Just pat me down for the love of God.
[5619.18s -> 5621.59s]  Whatever.
[5621.59s -> 5621.91s]  Let's go.
[5629.46s -> 5630.82s]  What does the word proximity mean?
[5631.54s -> 5632.74s]  It means near.
[5632.74s -> 5633.78s]  When you go near it.
[5634.87s -> 5635.51s]  Around.
[5635.51s -> 5636.55s]  In an area.
[5636.55s -> 5637.27s]  I know.
[5637.27s -> 5639.03s]  But what am I supposed to do with it?
[5639.03s -> 5640.71s]  If it arms if I put it on the ground?
[5640.71s -> 5641.67s]  No matter what I do.
[5641.67s -> 5642.47s]  And it's illegal!
[5645.45s -> 5647.21s]  So here's the deal, Flowers.
[5647.21s -> 5647.69s]  Here's the deal.
[5647.69s -> 5651.45s]  The boss is having a powwow with some employees, and discretion is the name of the game.
[5652.33s -> 5654.97s]  I'm sure you figured that out already, you being a scholar and all.
[5655.85s -> 5660.09s]  Don't discuss, disclose, or hell even contemplate what goes down.
[5660.89s -> 5662.89s]  Just set your mind to wool-gathering mode.
[5663.53s -> 5665.72s]  You think you can do that for me, Flowers?
[5666.60s -> 5668.84s]  Worry not, Mr. Cortezar.
[5668.84s -> 5670.84s]  I'm the very soul of discretion.
[5671.56s -> 5672.06s]  Good man.
[5672.84s -> 5675.22s]  Just waiting for someone to walk over there.
[5676.36s -> 5678.28s]  1080 is struggling, MonkaS.
[5678.28s -> 5678.78s]  It is.
[5680.20s -> 5682.44s]  I don't know why we're looking clear in an enclosed building.
[5683.59s -> 5684.95s]  Why am I eye twitching?
[5684.95s -> 5689.27s]  I'll place the wine on the table.
[5689.83s -> 5690.55s]  I'll pour it.
[5690.55s -> 5691.61s]  Deca-
[5691.61s -> 5693.75s]  Pardon me, your majesty.
[5693.75s -> 5698.12s]  It's considered the heralds the unspoken heroes of Providence.
[5698.12s -> 5699.32s]  He ain't okay.
[5700.28s -> 5701.34s]  I need to poison this.
[5701.98s -> 5704.78s]  I have to poison the wine.
[5705.78s -> 5706.66s]  I need to poison the wine.
[5708.87s -> 5709.51s]  I need to poison-
[5709.51s -> 5710.79s]  I need to poison the wine!
[5710.79s -> 5711.43s]  Wait a minute.
[5711.43s -> 5712.39s]  I have always-
[5712.39s -> 5716.68s]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[5716.68s -> 5719.24s]  Mr. Flowers, our resident sommelier.
[5719.24s -> 5719.74s]  Flowers.
[5719.74s -> 5721.40s]  I believe he has brought us something-
[5721.40s -> 5721.90s]  Oh shit!
[5722.20s -> 5723.40s]  Quite special.
[5723.40s -> 5724.44s]  Hello sir, how's your wine?
[5724.44s -> 5724.94s]  Do you want to-
[5724.94s -> 5726.04s]  I have to educate us, Mr. Flowers.
[5728.14s -> 5729.50s]  No, no, put the shitty one on the table.
[5729.50s -> 5730.54s]  Put the shitty one on the table.
[5731.26s -> 5734.22s]  I'm gonna put the really shitty one on the table.
[5734.22s -> 5734.94s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5734.94s -> 5735.44s]  Not the good one.
[5735.98s -> 5743.53s]  I'm gonna put the terrible one on the table.
[5744.01s -> 5746.92s]  That everybody hates.
[5746.92s -> 5754.98s]  Which one was it?
[5756.07s -> 5757.43s]  It was their, uh-
[5757.43s -> 5759.82s]  Was it the-
[5759.82s -> 5760.54s]  It was the Pinot, right?
[5760.54s -> 5761.82s]  Was the Pinot the one that they don't like?
[5762.38s -> 5763.18s]  It's the blue one, yep.
[5763.18s -> 5764.06s]  Nobody likes the Pinot.
[5764.62s -> 5769.10s]  Whatever, just-
[5769.10s -> 5772.38s]  Don't go over there and look.
[5774.10s -> 5774.74s]  Good, frisk me.
[5774.74s -> 5776.26s]  Don't go over there and look at anything, please.
[5776.26s -> 5776.76s]  Go.
[5791.14s -> 5792.18s]  No, don't walk over there.
[5794.34s -> 5796.73s]  I want that ax-
[5797.69s -> 5799.93s]  So bad, you have no idea.
[5801.13s -> 5802.49s]  So here's the deal, Flower.
[5810.78s -> 5813.51s]  It's illegal, I can't.
[5814.07s -> 5817.67s]  You being a scholar and all.
[5817.67s -> 5820.23s]  Don't discuss, disclose, or help-
[5820.23s -> 5820.95s]  Okay, where's the Pinot?
[5823.96s -> 5825.56s]  Even contemplate what goes down.
[5826.36s -> 5827.32s]  Just set your mind to-
[5827.32s -> 5828.44s]  This is the shitty one.
[5828.44s -> 5829.08s]  They're all gonna be like-
[5829.08s -> 5829.80s]  Pfft, ugh!
[5829.80s -> 5831.48s]  You can do that for me, Flowers.
[5831.48s -> 5836.33s]  To court as our very soul of discretion.
[5837.05s -> 5837.55s]  Good man.
[5840.79s -> 5842.79s]  And then smash the other one on the table.
[5844.63s -> 5845.11s]  Spill it.
[5846.78s -> 5848.94s]  We're gonna do like the Mr. Bean routine.
[5848.94s -> 5851.42s]  Where he like breaks the expensive bottle of alcohol or something.
[5851.42s -> 5852.94s]  Everyone like is staring at him.
[5852.94s -> 5856.81s]  Go on, place the wine on the table.
[5856.81s -> 5858.33s]  All right, I have to do the Mr. Bean routine.
[5858.33s -> 5859.30s]  I do.
[5859.30s -> 5861.62s]  Do not save over that one, stupid idiot.
[5861.62s -> 5862.12s]  Here we go.
[5874.50s -> 5875.00s]  Hello.
[5878.10s -> 5880.06s]  Wait a minute, I need-
[5880.06s -> 5892.10s]  I need this to play a few times.
[5897.54s -> 5898.90s]  It was so fucking loud, it hurt.
[5899.78s -> 5900.90s]  I need- I need to play this.
[5900.90s -> 5901.94s]  I need to get this recorded.
[5902.74s -> 5903.70s]  Will this pick up through here?
[5907.16s -> 5916.94s]  I need to get this saved.
[5916.94s -> 5922.26s]  Because I can't- I can't alt-tab and click it.
[5922.82s -> 5924.84s]  How do we try to pull that through?
[5925.48s -> 5926.54s]  Can I pull that through?
[5927.10s -> 5929.80s]  Take your own laugh track.
[5930.36s -> 5933.19s]  Dominic, I could.
[5933.19s -> 5962.70s]  That's just a roomful of weird people.
[5968.22s -> 5969.02s]  No, that's a roomful-
[5969.02s -> 5970.06s]  No, no, that doesn't work.
[5970.06s -> 5970.54s]  That doesn't work.
[5970.54s -> 5971.50s]  That doesn't work out.
[5971.50s -> 5972.06s]  That doesn't work.
[5972.06s -> 5973.10s]  That's a roomful of weird people.
[5973.74s -> 5975.16s]  I have to-
[5975.16s -> 5976.68s]  I gotta give this 30 more seconds to figure this out.
[5976.68s -> 5977.64s]  How am I gonna do this?
[5977.64s -> 5981.72s]  Fuck, I need a soundboard.
[5981.72s -> 5982.84s]  I need a laugh track soundboard
[5982.84s -> 5984.04s]  that I can put on this fucking thing.
[5991.66s -> 5993.02s]  Wait, I think I got it.
[5993.02s -> 5994.20s]  Where's my XLR?
[5997.21s -> 5997.71s]  Sampler!
[5999.58s -> 6000.38s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[6000.38s -> 6000.86s]  I think I got it.
[6001.42s -> 6010.97s]  It's not gonna work.
[6010.97s -> 6011.85s]  Sampler enabled.
[6011.85s -> 6014.01s]  Nah, I can't alt-tab.
[6014.01s -> 6018.73s]  It will-
[6018.73s -> 6019.45s]  I can't-
[6019.45s -> 6020.41s]  I have to like load it into-
[6020.41s -> 6022.25s]  It had to have already been prepared,
[6022.25s -> 6024.18s]  which it wasn't.
[6024.18s -> 6025.78s]  Scary fucking eyes.
[6025.78s -> 6029.05s]  Just do the-
[6029.05s -> 6030.49s]  Just do the laughs already.
[6030.49s -> 6032.17s]  You will need some boos too.
[6032.81s -> 6039.19s]  If I do this,
[6039.19s -> 6040.63s]  you let me know if it pulls through here.
[6040.63s -> 6041.19s]  Let me just do-
[6041.19s -> 6042.23s]  Let me try something really quick.
[6042.23s -> 6043.03s]  I'm gonna give this a minute.
[6043.03s -> 6043.67s]  I think it's worth it.
[6046.49s -> 6046.97s]  Routing.
[6046.97s -> 6047.45s]  Here we go.
[6048.09s -> 6054.28s]  If I do this-
[6058.76s -> 6061.40s]  Broadcast mix needs to be this.
[6063.40s -> 6064.12s]  Got it.
[6064.12s -> 6064.90s]  Here we go.
[6068.42s -> 6080.09s]  It was too long, wait.
[6087.03s -> 6087.35s]  Really?
[6087.91s -> 6088.71s]  No, what the fuck?
[6094.84s -> 6095.08s]  Why?
[6095.08s -> 6095.56s]  One minute-
[6096.20s -> 6097.00s]  Hello?
[6097.00s -> 6097.90s]  Hello?
[6097.90s -> 6098.30s]  What the fuck?
[6098.30s -> 6099.10s]  Why won't it save it?
[6099.82s -> 6101.26s]  Hold on, I have an idea.
[6101.26s -> 6103.96s]  I think I have to make a noise.
[6103.96s -> 6105.48s]  Boons.
[6112.44s -> 6112.68s]  It will-
[6112.68s -> 6113.56s]  It won't do it, nevermind.
[6113.56s -> 6128.38s]  Let's go.
[6128.38s -> 6129.02s]  Decrease-
[6129.90s -> 6134.52s]  I'm so-
[6134.52s -> 6135.16s]  I'm so upset.
[6136.18s -> 6138.58s]  The brain to the body and limbs of our-
[6139.14s -> 6141.51s]  I'm upset.
[6141.51s -> 6143.59s]  I had to like have that prepared like two hours ago.
[6144.15s -> 6146.74s]  All right.
[6146.74s -> 6147.46s]  What's the shitty one?
[6147.46s -> 6148.10s]  This one.

[8700.12s -> 8716.65s]  final level of the game what play is diana that'd be kind of cool but how did you know
[8718.10s -> 8726.52s]  your deal that kind of power always comes with a price what's yours i think you know
[8727.40s -> 8742.46s]  oh yeah it was a setup i am sorry this is a necessary evil have you done the heat gun
[8744.70s -> 8752.46s]  transfers by touch see edwards learns by his mistakes 47 and as you've clearly demonstrated
[8752.46s -> 8764.86s]  brute force is futile it had to be me it was the only way to get this class my family i know what
[8764.86s -> 8777.96s]  you did after all these years i finally know sorry you didn't have a choice i did providence
[8777.96s -> 8786.20s]  used you but i'm no better all i saw was a blank slate a weapon to wield this is when i put my
[8786.20s -> 8791.80s]  hand up and start shaking my fist and the crowd starts screaming hulk hogan starts to get on one
[8791.80s -> 8796.92s]  knee the ultimate warriors just towering over him the power he gains it shaking his fist back
[8796.92s -> 8810.86s]  and forth bye agent you're telling me to shut up you care about the you care about the storyline
[8810.86s -> 8841.64s]  here we just saw it this is important we care about feet what you guys are crazy this is

[8883.59s -> 8909.91s]  to your self-image agent 47 the apex predator always hiding behind the headlines i remember
[8909.91s -> 8924.55s]  this this is the first game was perfection its own justification or a willful distraction
[8927.93s -> 8934.86s]  i remember this level built contract by contract to shield you from the uncomfortable truth
[8935.66s -> 8944.65s]  i remember this level you're exactly the tool they bred you to be i remember this level
[8945.93s -> 8952.79s]  i remember that one i remember that guy i remember that dj i remember that lady how could you
[8952.79s -> 8966.42s]  possibly function on your own you never even had a name until i gave you one that's him burnwood
[8966.42s -> 8975.90s]  never ceases to surprise me you really are a most singular individual and to think she wanted me to
[8975.90s -> 8988.50s]  put you down lucky for you i never throw away anything useful prepare the serum forgetting's
[8988.50s -> 8997.08s]  not so bad you've done it before you may see it all in me a bad dream what's he doing is he still
[8997.16s -> 9003.88s]  looking at us i'm afraid so poor sap just won't accept his days are done perhaps i should take
[9003.88s -> 9012.76s]  him out to the woods and set him free oh it's a classic he was a loyal tool but everything goes
[9012.76s -> 9024.82s]  the way of the horse and cart eventually must be me up there are you the toxins are playing into
[9024.82s -> 9051.08s]  your fears don't let them why is this guy my opium on go to get your head straight she wants
[9051.08s -> 9060.62s]  me dead she has every right to after what we did but that's not what is really going on she chose
[9060.62s -> 9068.76s]  power in the end she was just like them no she found a way to turn edwards own cleverness against
[9068.76s -> 9084.04s]  him the rest is up to you i don't know how you do know diana once you dispose of edwards i will
[9084.04s -> 9092.84s]  dismantle providence from the top down it will finally be over all you have to do is embrace the

[11063.67s -> 11080.26s]  deal reload the last save file and kill one person only and one billion is wiped from the dead new
[11080.26s -> 11103.96s]  deal finish the game twice oh give me off screen it's been a long time agent 47 that's not who i
[11103.96s -> 11134.62s]  am anymore the name is the name's greg it's greg 47 v o r t i e z e v e n i choose this path because

[11316.46s -> 11363.30s]  inject yourself with the serum just take the serum grind xp take the serum myself oh wait hold on can
[11363.78s -> 11401.11s]  let's stop the train just wait hold it and wait hold the serum and wait second thoughts perhaps
[11401.11s -> 11410.78s]  we understand each other after all i have to wait 47 seconds he was haunted by his humanity freedom
[11410.78s -> 11427.69s]  from choice is also freedom everything is so much simpler in black and white thank you my friend i
[11427.69s -> 11441.38s]  will take care of you now all will be well wake up wake up my friend it's the dawn of a new day
[11441.54s -> 11462.76s]  and you have things to do how does that change how does that change the ending that's the that's it
[11462.76s -> 11480.74s]  you just wake up on a weird bed that was the start of hitman 1 what that's the start of hitman 1
[11481.46s -> 11493.22s]  so wait is that is that the true ending yeah i have played all of them i haven't played hitman 1
[11493.86s -> 11505.43s]  since i was probably like 17 like 18 or something it's been a long time i can prove that i played
[11505.43s -> 11511.75s]  the original hitman 1 because remember the mansion level with the that lady ran up the stairs it was
[11511.75s -> 11515.51s]  a mansion and it would be uh they they were they were speaking they weren't speaking english what
[11515.51s -> 11520.60s]  were they saying they ran up the stairs and like you you have to shoot the lady going upstairs
[11520.60s -> 11537.13s]  that's absolution no it's not no no no no no that's all the games that's most hitman games well a
[11537.13s -> 11541.21s]  lady running up the stairs not speaking english and you push her down the stairs i mean i guess
[11541.21s -> 11550.84s]  you could do that in all of them some i but i mean this is the whatever all right well i'm just
[11550.84s -> 11569.78s]  going to grind up a bunch of people now never touch this fucking franchise again well guess
[11569.78s -> 11577.42s]  what it's over they're not making any more hitman games the trilogy of assassination
[11578.06s -> 11584.62s]  is over you're never going to see me play this again until hitman
[11589.82s -> 11597.08s]  how do i get her to move i'll get her she's like freaking out just walk in there please
[11598.95s -> 11613.45s]  walk in walk in walk in walk in diana diana walk in
[11622.36s -> 11630.49s]  shoot her in push her i couldn't push her just shoot her
[11635.40s -> 11638.86s]  interesting are those cooling sockets they are indeed
[11639.82s -> 11646.38s]  the cooling system allows us to fine tune the entire process temperature humidity levels didn't
[11646.38s -> 11661.43s]  go up it's quite simple from the state of the yard why make you how did i get her to go up
[11661.43s -> 11673.77s]  go behind her when you shoot she'll back away from you just stand still don't move i kind of
[11673.77s -> 11678.71s]  blocked her right was i blocking her so stand still interesting are those cooling sockets they
[11678.71s -> 11686.07s]  are indeed so you will insist him allows us to fine tune the entire process temperature humidity
[11686.07s -> 11691.27s]  levels etc our goal here push button yeah i couldn't push her when she was standing up there
[11692.23s -> 11697.42s]  okay do i have to let me try to stand over there and we're just fucking around now the stream is
[11697.42s -> 11701.88s]  pretty much over we're just messing we're just hanging up we're never gonna get it how did i
[11701.88s -> 11709.38s]  get it again it's like a way i think i have to if i move like over here maybe she'll i'll block
[11709.38s -> 11714.20s]  her and she'll move up there are those cooling sockets save it like right here so i can reload it
[11714.20s -> 11720.89s]  like a thousand times they are indeed signora cooling system allows us to fine tune the entire
[11720.89s -> 11737.53s]  process don't know it doesn't work i got lucky and i blew it you ruined it i didn't move the
[11737.53s -> 11744.25s]  last time i tried it system allows us to fine tune the entire process temperature humidity levels
[11745.21s -> 11746.65s]  didn't work the last time when i stood still
[11752.81s -> 11765.78s]  i didn't move the last time i reloaded it what are you talking about ron's dead
[11770.73s -> 11775.02s]  cooling system allows us to fine tune the entire process
[11775.74s -> 11778.70s]  temperature humidity levels etc oh well
[11778.70s -> 11784.86s]  our goal here at pineda yates it's quite simple from the state of the art winemaking facility
[11784.86s -> 11789.42s]  to our carefully nurtured gravestock handpicked with loving care we look what
[11791.02s -> 11795.02s]  i'm gonna add some special ingredients okay i'll add some extra wine
[11799.90s -> 11802.86s]  a little bit of that a little bit of uh a little bit of metal
[11803.58s -> 11813.46s]  large fermentation tanks constructed from solid french oak and each contain up to 500 gallons of
[11814.42s -> 11818.81s]  interesting are those cooling something they are indeed
[11820.57s -> 11834.46s]  ah yes their large fermentation tanks are constructed from solid french oak i think this
[11834.46s -> 11863.27s]  could use a little bit of spice i gotta go stand up here okay here we go it's time to do the thing
[11863.27s -> 11870.71s]  i wanted to do the whole time you threw that good for you all right here's what we're gonna do um
[11871.35s -> 11876.38s]  just let everybody know the stream is the stream is over i'm gonna i'm gonna kill everybody in the
[11876.38s -> 11882.44s]  room we're gonna grind everybody in the room just to let everybody know that's what's happening
[11882.44s -> 11888.92s]  now that's what's going on humidity levels etc our goal here at pineda yates it's quite simple
[11888.92s -> 11901.00s]  from the state of the art might as well start at the top here just broke her neck i'm turning
[11906.28s -> 11925.82s]  he shoot it out of my fucking head all right i scratchy ass beard that just threw me off

[12052.94s -> 12055.34s]  very cool i love it come down here
[12055.34s -> 12060.30s]  temperature humidity levels etc stupid dumb fucking dumb fucking idiot stupid
[12060.30s -> 12072.79s]  fucking goddamn fucking game new strategy stupid fucking goddamn fucking stupid fucking game
[12072.79s -> 12096.31s]  fucking goddamn fucking idiot bro it's okay to put the catboy costume on here we go this is it

[12189.13s -> 12195.56s]  to be everyone yes of course but what if i can't get every single person over what they said to
[12195.56s -> 12282.14s]  despawn i'm over here i'm over here what's the bad guy put them on this put them on the ground
[12282.14s -> 12289.05s]  and then activate the smasher holy shit that's a way better idea i'll just wait i'm gonna save it
[12289.05s -> 12295.30s]  we'll crush like 100 people in the ground in the in the crusher holy shit what a good idea
[12298.04s -> 12302.68s]  yeah that's an that's an incredible idea yeah let's go can i do this first

[12395.13s -> 12404.15s]  patience for this trust me the payoff will probably be worth it especially when we squish them
[12413.66s -> 12434.68s]  telling us to have patience hydraulic press them okay i'm gonna save it i'm gonna save it here i
[12434.68s -> 12441.69s]  can't even i can't save it till i'm not let me oh you okay i'm not am i still compromised
