[0.31s -> 16.89s]  Hey, what is going on everybody. Jerma here with Super Meat Boy Chapter 5, The Rapture.
[16.89s -> 23.43s]  And this is going to be probably the ragiest episode. Well, I take that back.
[23.43s -> 26.43s]  You might be watching this in the future after I do a few more of these episodes and go,
[26.43s -> 32.43s]  Jerma, well, three episodes from now you throw your controller against the wall and punch your brother in the face.
[32.43s -> 35.43s]  Well, you know, I'm sorry, but I will. Let's just go.
[35.43s -> 41.66s]  Rapture Chapter 5. I'm not looking forward to this, guys.
[41.66s -> 44.60s]  So let's start the cutscene.
[51.51s -> 55.88s]  We're climbing. Oh my God, my whole body hurts.
[56.88s -> 59.12s]  Time to get revenge.
[60.12s -> 64.81s]  Yay, I did it. I kicked that asshole off the edge.
[64.81s -> 67.50s]  The Rapture.
[67.50s -> 72.11s]  Here we go, guys. Level one.
[72.11s -> 75.11s]  I only have four Band-Aids. My goodness gracious, that's bad.
[75.11s -> 81.13s]  Let's try and get this warp zone. I don't think I'm going to have enough time to get it.
[82.56s -> 84.56s]  Oh, listen to that music.
[86.99s -> 88.99s]  Oh dear Lord.
[88.99s -> 94.26s]  Already level one. It's like impossible.
[94.26s -> 96.46s]  Here we go.
[96.46s -> 100.46s]  I got to remember there's like a very specific way you do this. You go up.
[100.46s -> 104.46s]  And then, oh my God, I don't remember.
[104.46s -> 108.02s]  No, I do. Now I do. Now I do. Now I do.
[108.02s -> 110.90s]  Let's make this...
[110.90s -> 115.90s]  I'm gonna die so many times in this game.
[115.90s -> 120.78s]  You have to go very fast right here. It's like that. No!
[126.11s -> 131.23s]  Well, welcome to the 97 minute video.
[131.23s -> 139.06s]  There we go. There it is. Warp zone. You know what? Forget the warp zone.
[139.06s -> 143.42s]  I know for a fact I'm going to be very mad at myself.
[143.42s -> 150.22s]  Oh my goodness gracious. That was just level one.
[150.22s -> 153.10s]  That was level one.
[153.10s -> 156.75s]  Level one, folks.
[166.08s -> 168.45s]  That's one way.
[168.45s -> 170.45s]  Forget what you do here. Definitely this.
[170.45s -> 173.14s]  That one wasn't so bad.
[173.14s -> 175.44s]  That one wasn't so bad.
[175.44s -> 180.92s]  Go. We got to jump over because it pushes you down.
[180.92s -> 186.04s]  Jump. Oh dear God.
[186.04s -> 191.98s]  Jump. Jump.
[191.98s -> 194.34s]  No.
[194.34s -> 198.97s]  Speaking another language now. German, apparently.
[198.97s -> 203.73s]  Okay, get this right this time. Just float through it.
[203.73s -> 206.22s]  Float through it. No! Oh!
[206.22s -> 211.06s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[211.06s -> 214.06s]  What you got? I can't believe it didn't register again.
[214.06s -> 220.30s]  It usually doesn't happen two times in a row like that.
[220.30s -> 222.92s]  Oh, for the love of...
[222.92s -> 224.92s]  Here come the swears.
[224.92s -> 230.66s]  You know, if you are an old subscriber of mine, you know that I typically don't use a...
[230.66s -> 232.66s]  How come this...
[232.66s -> 236.41s]  You know that I typically don't swear very much in my videos,
[236.41s -> 240.41s]  and that's because I like to keep my channel PG-13, essentially.
[240.41s -> 246.41s]  But when you're playing Super Meat Boy, sometimes you just have to scream the F word.
[251.10s -> 254.82s]  Okay, here we go. Let's do it. Come on.
[254.82s -> 260.78s]  Oh, boy. It's going to be a long day.
[260.78s -> 269.44s]  No, I'm not going to make it. Not going to make it. Not going to make it.
[269.44s -> 273.98s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[273.98s -> 279.72s]  Come on. Come on. My whole body just moved.
[279.72s -> 283.72s]  Oh, I am doing something wrong. You know what? I need to stop on that platform.
[283.72s -> 286.28s]  That's what I'm doing wrong.
[286.28s -> 289.78s]  Oh, boy.
[289.78s -> 295.00s]  I hope this isn't like a nine-hour video.
[295.00s -> 298.30s]  All right. No. Right here. Stay there.
[298.30s -> 301.95s]  That's not what I wanted. That's not what I wanted!
[305.28s -> 311.74s]  Okay. Who knows? Guys, I really might puke.
[311.74s -> 313.74s]  Oh, my word. There's no way I'm going to get this.
[313.74s -> 315.74s]  This is impossible. This is impossible.
[315.74s -> 318.69s]  This is not possible.
[318.69s -> 321.38s]  I might as well just jump off the damn edge.
[321.38s -> 323.74s]  Whee. Yeah, just jump off the damn edge.
[327.52s -> 334.54s]  Come on. Get it.
[334.54s -> 336.98s]  Okay. Okay.
[336.98s -> 339.98s]  Now, I can't let this happen like this again.
[339.98s -> 344.24s]  Oh, I forget how you even go about doing this.
[344.24s -> 346.80s]  Go, go, you smelly.
[346.80s -> 352.64s]  Okay, I cannot mess this up, or else I'm going to be very bad.
[355.99s -> 359.64s]  There was a lot of deaths there, and I skipped them all.
[359.64s -> 360.64s]  I'm sorry.
[360.64s -> 363.58s]  No, I got to come across like this.
[363.58s -> 366.53s]  Just...
[366.53s -> 370.50s]  God.
[378.75s -> 380.75s]  God, no.
[384.72s -> 386.72s]  My whole body hurts. This is like level three.
[386.72s -> 388.72s]  I don't even know what level this is.
[388.72s -> 391.60s]  Well, I didn't make that.
[391.60s -> 392.60s]  Now I know what to do exactly, though.
[392.60s -> 394.60s]  Get it this time. I'm going to get it this time.
[394.60s -> 395.78s]  Here we go.
[395.78s -> 401.78s]  Oh, for the... I'm going to punch a piece of puke in the face.
[403.78s -> 407.50s]  I hope I'm not peeking my microphone.
[407.50s -> 412.42s]  I got to go much higher than that.
[412.42s -> 416.35s]  Like that.
[416.35s -> 421.58s]  Come on. Come on.
[421.58s -> 422.58s]  Time to switch.
[422.58s -> 425.08s]  Time to switch to commander video.
[425.08s -> 429.16s]  Oh, yeah.
[429.16s -> 431.16s]  I just fought off edge, I stupid.
[431.16s -> 434.42s]  It's like so much worse.
[435.60s -> 440.21s]  Oh, just get me over here.
[440.21s -> 443.28s]  It doesn't even matter. I can't even...
[443.28s -> 448.82s]  You know, I really need to unlock a couple of characters.
[448.82s -> 450.82s]  That's like the big kicker right here.
[450.82s -> 455.54s]  What if I do this?
[455.54s -> 456.54s]  Is that going to help me?
[456.54s -> 457.85s]  No, it's not.
[457.85s -> 458.85s]  Absolutely not.
[458.85s -> 462.30s]  What? I'm stuck.
[467.42s -> 469.24s]  Come on. There it is.
[469.24s -> 470.24s]  There we go.
[470.24s -> 472.18s]  Finally.
[472.18s -> 473.18s]  No.
[473.18s -> 475.96s]  How am I...
[475.96s -> 476.96s]  There's no way.
[476.96s -> 477.96s]  There's no way I can do this.
[477.96s -> 480.20s]  How am I going to make this jump?
[484.54s -> 485.54s]  That was my head exploding.
[485.54s -> 489.70s]  You know, I'm probably doing something wrong.
[489.70s -> 491.70s]  And this is what happens when you play the game blind
[491.70s -> 493.70s]  if you're not playing for like a year or two.
[493.70s -> 495.06s]  No, I'm doing something wrong.
[495.06s -> 496.06s]  What am I doing wrong?
[496.06s -> 498.26s]  I will never know.
[498.26s -> 504.26s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[504.26s -> 508.18s]  What if I...
[508.18s -> 509.18s]  Do I jump up there maybe?
[509.18s -> 510.55s]  I just don't know.
[510.55s -> 512.55s]  I just don't know.
[512.55s -> 515.65s]  Oh, that's what you have to do.
[515.65s -> 517.65s]  You got to like hang out on it for a second.
[517.65s -> 518.65s]  All right, I got it.
[518.65s -> 519.65s]  I got it. I got it.
[519.65s -> 523.91s]  Man, this is just going to get so much worse.
[530.40s -> 534.15s]  No, I just tried to do the same damn thing I was doing before.
[534.15s -> 535.15s]  All right, so how long has it been?
[535.15s -> 539.42s]  Like 30 minutes and I'm on like level six?
[539.42s -> 542.94s]  Oh, don't you dare.
[542.94s -> 545.94s]  Don't you dare.
[545.94s -> 548.70s]  Oh, I got an A plus.
[548.70s -> 549.70s]  Level five.
[549.70s -> 553.28s]  Oh, my goodness.
[553.28s -> 554.28s]  Good.
[554.28s -> 558.54s]  I'd rather play on this level to be totally honest with you.
[558.54s -> 560.54s]  This thing is a piece of cake compared to the other ones.
[560.54s -> 565.92s]  I can't.
[565.92s -> 569.89s]  Go, go, go.
[569.89s -> 573.70s]  You slippery bastard.
[573.70s -> 579.68s]  And cut this thing off.
[579.68s -> 582.68s]  If I can make it up there.
[582.68s -> 584.50s]  Good, good, good.
[584.50s -> 586.50s]  Let's string a few together, huh?
[586.50s -> 592.17s]  It's been a while since I've been able to string one of these together.
[592.17s -> 596.46s]  The real question is I need to...
[596.46s -> 598.46s]  Oh, I'm like not paying attention.
[598.46s -> 599.46s]  Does that stay open?
[599.46s -> 600.46s]  No, it doesn't.
[600.46s -> 602.46s]  Okay, go, go, go.
[602.46s -> 605.54s]  Whew.
[605.54s -> 606.84s]  The fallen.
[606.84s -> 607.84s]  The fallen.
[607.84s -> 610.59s]  I should have grabbed that key.
[610.59s -> 614.83s]  Like, you know, I got to get that key when it falls like this.
[614.83s -> 616.78s]  Like that.
[616.78s -> 621.22s]  Hmm.
[621.22s -> 624.80s]  Don't know what's down here.
[624.80s -> 625.80s]  Nothing.
[625.80s -> 626.80s]  There's nothing down here.
[626.80s -> 627.80s]  Except the button.
[627.80s -> 630.49s]  You have to...
[630.49s -> 636.42s]  They're training you to catch that key.
[636.42s -> 637.42s]  That's what that's all about.
[637.42s -> 642.62s]  Isn't that just fan-freaking-tastic?
[642.62s -> 643.62s]  Die!
[643.62s -> 646.31s]  You just have to die if you don't get it.
[646.31s -> 647.31s]  That's the worst part.
[647.31s -> 652.86s]  This whole game is just about playing the level over and over and over again
[652.86s -> 654.86s]  until you memorize the pattern.
[654.86s -> 657.12s]  And I got it.
[657.12s -> 658.12s]  I got it.
[658.12s -> 659.49s]  Let's go back now.
[659.49s -> 661.18s]  Can I even go back?
[661.18s -> 662.18s]  Yeah, I can.
[663.61s -> 667.66s]  Whew.
[667.66s -> 671.80s]  Oh, I didn't have enough speed!
[671.80s -> 677.00s]  I didn't have enough goddamn speed!
[677.00s -> 679.00s]  Meepo, you're supposed to be all about speed.
[679.00s -> 684.23s]  What the hell, man?
[684.23s -> 685.23s]  There's the speed I need.
[685.23s -> 687.23s]  A little bit of speed, that's it.
[687.23s -> 688.73s]  What?
[688.73s -> 690.80s]  Oh.
[690.80s -> 691.80s]  Imagine if I just fell down right there.
[691.80s -> 695.30s]  I would probably take a dump and a brick would come out.
[695.30s -> 698.58s]  Good.
[698.58s -> 700.58s]  Give me 50 of these levels in a row.
[700.58s -> 701.58s]  I can handle these.
[701.58s -> 702.58s]  No, I can't.
[702.58s -> 706.10s]  Eh, famous last words.
[706.10s -> 711.59s]  I've got to be easy here.
[711.59s -> 712.59s]  Just a pattern.
[712.59s -> 714.54s]  That's all it is.
[714.54s -> 719.50s]  I'm going to go left, stand left, and then go right.
[719.50s -> 723.00s]  It's all just a bunch of mathematical problems.
[723.00s -> 728.16s]  Oh my god, what am I thinking?
[728.16s -> 729.16s]  Very easy.
[729.16s -> 730.53s]  Very easy.
[730.53s -> 731.96s]  Just be easy.
[731.96s -> 733.52s]  You've got to be smooth.
[733.52s -> 734.52s]  You just got...
[734.52s -> 735.52s]  Why did I just let that hit me?
[735.52s -> 739.52s]  I just stood there with like a goose with a thumb up my butt.
[739.52s -> 740.52s]  Just like...
[740.52s -> 744.08s]  I don't know what kind of relevance that has, but...
[744.08s -> 748.08s]  Oh my god.
[748.08s -> 751.08s]  I can't take it anymore.
[751.08s -> 752.26s]  I need to utilize my jumps.
[752.26s -> 754.26s]  I have the damn jumps.
[754.26s -> 756.26s]  Like, why am I not utilizing them?
[756.26s -> 758.43s]  I was in the clear.
[758.43s -> 764.64s]  I'm going to drink gasoline if that happens again, but not really.
[764.64s -> 775.80s]  Oh, I got ultimate rage party.
[775.80s -> 780.80s]  Who wants to be invited to the ultimate rage party with me as your host?
[780.80s -> 783.36s]  Oh, it's not even over yet.
[783.36s -> 785.36s]  Not even close to being over, probably.
[785.36s -> 788.56s]  And then you got this little dumb jump.
[788.56s -> 790.50s]  A+.
[790.50s -> 791.50s]  Yeah.
[791.50s -> 792.50s]  Thanks.
[792.50s -> 795.02s]  Hey.
[795.02s -> 796.02s]  Hey.
[796.02s -> 797.02s]  Hey.
[797.02s -> 798.84s]  Whoa.
[798.84s -> 800.66s]  Whoa.
[800.66s -> 801.66s]  What did I ever do to you?
[801.66s -> 803.73s]  Leave me alone.
[803.73s -> 804.73s]  Who do you think you are?
[804.73s -> 805.73s]  What do you think you're doing?
[805.73s -> 808.18s]  You know, I'm running you back here.
[808.18s -> 809.18s]  You're a real nuisance.
[809.18s -> 810.18s]  Get out of here.
[810.18s -> 811.18s]  I'll let your other buddy out too.
[811.18s -> 812.18s]  You guys can play hide and go seek together for all I care.
[812.18s -> 814.58s]  Get away from me.
[814.58s -> 815.58s]  Oh, and now there's three of yous?
[815.58s -> 816.58s]  I can't wait.
[816.58s -> 818.26s]  Let's have a party.
[818.26s -> 822.13s]  All right.
[822.13s -> 825.61s]  This one's not that bad.
[825.61s -> 826.61s]  I just got to keep these guys at bay.
[826.61s -> 827.61s]  Get this thing.
[827.61s -> 830.70s]  Drag this idiot over here.
[830.70s -> 831.70s]  Come on.
[831.70s -> 832.70s]  I know you're all about jumping around like a freak.
[832.70s -> 833.70s]  Just like me.
[833.70s -> 835.52s]  We could be best friends.
[835.52s -> 836.52s]  Thank you.
[836.52s -> 837.52s]  Grinding mill.
[837.52s -> 838.52s]  Wow.
[838.52s -> 839.52s]  Okay.
[839.52s -> 840.52s]  Okay.
[840.52s -> 843.10s]  Cool.
[843.10s -> 845.30s]  I'm trying to like just cheat.
[845.30s -> 846.30s]  Can I jump up to you?
[846.30s -> 847.30s]  What am I?
[847.30s -> 848.30s]  Oh, now I remember.
[848.30s -> 853.02s]  You need to, you need to last this entire time until they all fall down.
[853.02s -> 854.02s]  Get out.
[854.02s -> 855.02s]  Oh, hold on.
[855.02s -> 856.02s]  Headphone just fell out.
[856.02s -> 858.47s]  Headphone fell out of here.
[858.47s -> 859.47s]  Emergency.
[859.47s -> 860.90s]  There we go.
[860.90s -> 861.90s]  It's back in.
[861.90s -> 862.90s]  Just standing here dying over and over again.
[862.90s -> 863.90s]  That's fantastic.
[863.90s -> 864.90s]  Let's go.
[864.90s -> 869.58s]  Come on.
[869.58s -> 871.53s]  I'll take all of you on at the same time.
[871.53s -> 872.53s]  Yeah.
[872.53s -> 873.53s]  Look at this.
[873.53s -> 876.05s]  Look at this.
[876.05s -> 877.05s]  Exploit.
[877.05s -> 878.48s]  Exploit.
[878.48s -> 880.49s]  Another question.
[880.49s -> 881.49s]  What is this?
[881.49s -> 882.49s]  What is this?
[882.49s -> 883.92s]  What is this?
[883.92s -> 884.92s]  What is this?
[884.92s -> 887.18s]  What is this?
[887.18s -> 888.18s]  What is this?
[888.18s -> 889.49s]  What is this?
[889.49s -> 890.49s]  What is this?
[890.49s -> 891.73s]  What is this?
[891.73s -> 893.16s]  What is this?
[894.16s -> 895.85s]  Exploit.
[895.85s -> 896.85s]  Exploit.
[896.85s -> 898.15s]  Another question is how do I get down?
[898.15s -> 899.33s]  That's the actual question now.
[899.33s -> 900.33s]  Like this?
[900.33s -> 903.22s]  No, you have to go back and forth.
[903.22s -> 904.22s]  It's all about just going.
[904.22s -> 910.73s]  Oh, you had to have it spawn right there, you son of a bitch.
[910.73s -> 911.73s]  Give me the key.
[911.73s -> 912.97s]  Give me the key.
[912.97s -> 914.40s]  Give me that key.
[914.40s -> 919.22s]  Now that they're all spread out, get away from me.
[919.22s -> 920.22s]  No more spawn, right?
[920.22s -> 921.66s]  Oh my God.
[921.66s -> 924.24s]  Come on.
[924.24s -> 927.79s]  Oh, I'm going to punch someone.
[927.79s -> 931.07s]  I'm going to punch myself in the face.
[931.07s -> 934.26s]  It's waiting over here.
[934.26s -> 935.26s]  No, no, I can't.
[935.26s -> 936.26s]  Just keep moving.
[936.26s -> 942.52s]  God, it's so much anxiety.
[942.52s -> 945.55s]  Make it.
[945.55s -> 946.55s]  No.
[946.55s -> 947.55s]  No.
[947.55s -> 955.14s]  Come on.
[955.14s -> 956.74s]  There is no escaping this.
[956.74s -> 959.00s]  I need to get this going here.
[959.00s -> 960.00s]  I need to get this going.
[960.00s -> 964.78s]  Give me the key.
[964.78s -> 966.02s]  Everyone get over here.
[966.02s -> 967.98s]  I swear there's a tea party over there on the right side.
[967.98s -> 968.98s]  Now I'm taking way too long.
[968.98s -> 971.63s]  Go.
[972.59s -> 973.59s]  I got it.
[973.59s -> 974.59s]  I got it.
[974.59s -> 977.43s]  I got it and everything.
[977.43s -> 984.49s]  Oh, I just send me to hell.
[984.49s -> 985.49s]  Wow.
[985.49s -> 986.49s]  That's yeah.
[986.49s -> 989.01s]  Okay.
[989.01s -> 990.76s]  Hi, guys.
[990.76s -> 991.76s]  Oh, I did.
[991.76s -> 992.76s]  I did take a break after that one.
[992.76s -> 993.76s]  Hold on.
[993.76s -> 994.76s]  Give me 10 seconds.
[994.76s -> 998.43s]  We'll watch all these deaths.
[998.43s -> 1003.46s]  Oh, holy crap.
[1003.46s -> 1009.50s]  That is a way to have your stomach erupt in flames.
[1009.50s -> 1010.50s]  What?
[1010.50s -> 1012.45s]  Oh, hey.
[1012.45s -> 1015.49s]  Hey, leave me alone.
[1015.49s -> 1017.18s]  Go.
[1017.18s -> 1018.18s]  Get them.
[1018.18s -> 1019.86s]  I can get them killed, can't I?
[1019.86s -> 1022.28s]  I'm not sure I can get them killed.
[1022.28s -> 1023.28s]  Hit the button.
[1023.28s -> 1024.71s]  Hit the button.
[1024.71s -> 1031.78s]  Oh, you troll.
[1031.78s -> 1036.10s]  This is this game was just created to frustrate people.
[1036.10s -> 1037.10s]  And that's why it's so fun.
[1037.10s -> 1039.11s]  Get me up there.
[1039.11s -> 1041.29s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1041.29s -> 1043.81s]  There it is.
[1043.81s -> 1044.81s]  Wait, where's the?
[1044.81s -> 1049.05s]  Oh, no, I got to hit the button too.
[1049.05s -> 1050.61s]  Let's try this again.
[1050.61s -> 1051.61s]  There we go.
[1051.61s -> 1052.61s]  Yeah.
[1052.61s -> 1054.62s]  Get smashed.
[1054.62s -> 1055.62s]  Get smashed.
[1055.62s -> 1066.25s]  Thank the high heavens.
[1066.37s -> 1071.53s]  And go.
[1071.53s -> 1073.17s]  I wish these guys would just go away.
[1073.17s -> 1075.89s]  I can't imagine what this is like in the dark world.
[1075.89s -> 1076.89s]  There's no way I'm going to get up here.
[1076.89s -> 1077.89s]  Yeah, there is.
[1077.89s -> 1079.37s]  Come on now, man.
[1079.37s -> 1080.37s]  I was there.
[1080.37s -> 1083.53s]  Go.
[1083.53s -> 1086.30s]  Go.
[1086.30s -> 1087.93s]  Oh.
[1087.93s -> 1089.94s]  Hoo.
[1089.94s -> 1092.01s]  Hoo.
[1092.01s -> 1094.66s]  The lamb?
[1094.66s -> 1096.66s]  What the hell was this level just called?
[1096.66s -> 1098.34s]  The lamb?
[1098.34s -> 1099.34s]  Go.
[1099.34s -> 1101.74s]  Oh.
[1101.74s -> 1102.74s]  Hands.
[1102.74s -> 1103.74s]  Hands are getting sweaty.
[1103.74s -> 1108.14s]  That's how you know you're in a lot of trouble when your hands get all clammy.
[1109.84s -> 1110.84s]  Go.
[1110.84s -> 1112.02s]  Jump.
[1112.02s -> 1113.62s]  Jump.
[1113.62s -> 1114.62s]  Jump.
[1114.62s -> 1115.86s]  Jump.
[1115.86s -> 1116.86s]  Oh.
[1116.86s -> 1117.86s]  No, wait.
[1117.86s -> 1118.86s]  I can wait here.
[1118.86s -> 1120.36s]  I can rest here.
[1120.36s -> 1121.66s]  Go.
[1121.66s -> 1123.35s]  Go.
[1123.35s -> 1124.59s]  Go.
[1124.59s -> 1125.90s]  Come on.
[1125.90s -> 1126.90s]  Come on.
[1126.90s -> 1127.90s]  Come on.
[1127.90s -> 1128.90s]  Come on.
[1128.90s -> 1129.90s]  Come on.
[1129.90s -> 1132.54s]  Oh my god.
[1132.54s -> 1136.55s]  Oh my god.
[1136.55s -> 1139.70s]  I think that just took six months off my life.
[1139.70s -> 1140.70s]  I really think so.
[1140.70s -> 1144.66s]  I remember these guys.
[1144.66s -> 1146.98s]  They chase you around.
[1147.06s -> 1150.90s]  These guys are really annoying.
[1150.90s -> 1153.50s]  They remind me of the thing in the...
[1153.50s -> 1157.71s]  A lot of things remind me of the Mario Brothers thing, huh?
[1157.71s -> 1162.00s]  I want to go off that wall.
[1162.00s -> 1163.69s]  Yeah.
[1163.69s -> 1164.69s]  Come on.
[1164.69s -> 1168.10s]  Come on.
[1168.10s -> 1169.10s]  Get that key.
[1169.10s -> 1172.17s]  I've got to go back up here now, don't I?
[1172.17s -> 1173.17s]  No, I don't.
[1173.17s -> 1174.54s]  You know what?
[1174.54s -> 1177.94s]  I kind of want to go up here and just launch off just to get away from this guy, but I'm
[1177.94s -> 1182.16s]  not going to do that because I'll probably end in certain death.
[1182.16s -> 1184.16s]  So I'm just going to do it again.
[1184.16s -> 1185.16s]  Don't get st...
[1185.16s -> 1186.16s]  Oh, I got stuck underneath.
[1186.16s -> 1189.16s]  You know, I'm just going to do what I want to do in the beginning, just jump off the
[1189.16s -> 1191.36s]  whole thing.
[1191.36s -> 1193.82s]  Nope.
[1193.82s -> 1194.82s]  That didn't work.
[1194.82s -> 1195.82s]  I had it too.
[1195.82s -> 1196.82s]  Why did I come all the way back here?
[1196.82s -> 1198.38s]  Why did I do that?
[1198.38s -> 1200.52s]  That was such a dumb move.
[1200.52s -> 1205.67s]  And so was jumping into his mouth right there.
[1205.67s -> 1208.49s]  I don't know where anything is.
[1208.49s -> 1211.20s]  No.
[1211.20s -> 1213.85s]  Ugh.
[1213.85s -> 1216.94s]  God.
[1216.94s -> 1218.50s]  Jump.
[1218.50s -> 1219.50s]  Jump over him.
[1219.50s -> 1221.38s]  Yeah.
[1221.38s -> 1223.97s]  Come follow me this way.
[1223.97s -> 1224.97s]  Anglerfish.
[1224.97s -> 1225.97s]  Whatever the hell you are.
[1225.97s -> 1228.17s]  Freak of nature.
[1228.17s -> 1230.18s]  Get away.
[1230.18s -> 1233.18s]  Oh, now he's just going to hover here.
[1233.18s -> 1236.94s]  I hate this guy.
[1236.94s -> 1238.94s]  Oh, he's stuck over here now.
[1238.94s -> 1239.94s]  Oh, man.
[1239.94s -> 1240.94s]  This is bad.
[1240.94s -> 1243.97s]  This is bad.
[1243.97s -> 1245.72s]  Oh.
[1245.72s -> 1248.98s]  I got to get over here.
[1248.98s -> 1251.95s]  Ugh.
[1251.95s -> 1254.28s]  Ugh.
[1254.28s -> 1264.99s]  Let's watch the deaths.
[1264.99s -> 1265.99s]  Everybody goes.
[1265.99s -> 1269.43s]  There actually wasn't very many people.
[1269.43s -> 1272.61s]  Only one survived this long though.
[1272.61s -> 1273.61s]  And it was this guy.
[1273.61s -> 1275.55s]  The flood.
[1275.55s -> 1276.86s]  Oh, the flood.
[1276.86s -> 1277.86s]  Oi.
[1277.86s -> 1280.48s]  The flood isn't coming.
[1280.48s -> 1282.78s]  You have to run from the flood.
[1282.78s -> 1283.78s]  I should have ran already.
[1283.78s -> 1284.78s]  Yeah.
[1284.78s -> 1286.09s]  I should have ran before that.
[1286.09s -> 1287.84s]  Like right now.
[1287.84s -> 1289.84s]  And I shouldn't hit my head on the ceiling.
[1289.84s -> 1293.22s]  Like a butt head.
[1293.22s -> 1295.22s]  Now I'm in a lot of trouble.
[1295.22s -> 1297.35s]  Gotta go fast.
[1297.35s -> 1305.16s]  Stop going slow.
[1305.16s -> 1306.16s]  Ugh.
[1306.16s -> 1308.78s]  I slowed down again.
[1308.78s -> 1310.22s]  Good.
[1310.22s -> 1311.22s]  Oh.
[1311.22s -> 1319.74s]  If somebody were to cut together all the noises I've made in these videos, you'd probably have quite a symphony of noises.
[1319.74s -> 1326.82s]  I hate plus.
[1326.82s -> 1331.02s]  I think I've only gotten three or four of those this entire time.
[1331.02s -> 1334.35s]  Oh my goodness gracious.
[1334.35s -> 1335.35s]  Hey, look.
[1335.35s -> 1336.35s]  She's right there.
[1336.35s -> 1337.35s]  Yo.
[1337.35s -> 1338.35s]  What a troll.
[1338.35s -> 1342.98s]  What a troll.
[1342.98s -> 1343.98s]  Aye.
[1343.98s -> 1347.06s]  Germa powering down.
[1347.06s -> 1349.49s]  Germa powering down.
[1349.49s -> 1351.73s]  Germa is powering down.
[1351.73s -> 1354.67s]  Ugh.
[1354.67s -> 1355.67s]  Backup power initiated.
[1355.67s -> 1358.32s]  Really?
[1358.32s -> 1359.32s]  You just gotta have to jump over there.
[1359.32s -> 1360.32s]  Just into her.
[1360.32s -> 1362.32s]  And you just get launched down like that.
[1362.32s -> 1363.32s]  That's how you do it.
[1363.32s -> 1367.97s]  The only question now is just getting over here without getting crushed.
[1367.97s -> 1371.17s]  I don't even know what's over there.
[1371.17s -> 1372.17s]  I have no idea.
[1372.17s -> 1380.13s]  Hey, why didn't I just jump over there?
[1380.13s -> 1381.13s]  And what am I doing?
[1381.13s -> 1383.13s]  What am I doing with my life?
[1383.13s -> 1385.94s]  This time I'm just going to jump.
[1385.94s -> 1392.92s]  I'm gonna go to commander video.
[1392.92s -> 1396.92s]  I have a feeling that he might be a little bit better on this particular stage at least.
[1396.92s -> 1398.92s]  Oh, just go straight down.
[1404.00s -> 1405.00s]  Oh, that was just...
[1405.00s -> 1407.00s]  Oh, come on.
[1407.00s -> 1411.66s]  You're gonna do that to me like that.
[1411.66s -> 1412.66s]  You're gonna play with commander video.
[1412.66s -> 1413.66s]  You gotta go a long way.
[1413.66s -> 1414.66s]  I didn't...
[1414.66s -> 1421.53s]  Where is my jump?
[1421.53s -> 1422.53s]  There it is.
[1422.53s -> 1423.53s]  And now I brought this guy.
[1423.53s -> 1424.77s]  Great.
[1424.77s -> 1427.46s]  He's absolutely going to kill me.
[1427.46s -> 1430.85s]  Not if I do this.
[1435.52s -> 1437.52s]  This is not healthy.
[1437.52s -> 1440.78s]  This is not healthy.
[1440.78s -> 1446.84s]  If I went to my doctor and told him, like,
[1446.84s -> 1447.84s]  Oh, hey, doctor.
[1447.84s -> 1449.84s]  By the way, I'm playing Super Meat Boy right now.
[1449.84s -> 1450.84s]  He'd probably be like,
[1450.84s -> 1452.84s]  Don't play that game.
[1452.84s -> 1456.23s]  That game's gonna give you a heart attack, son.
[1456.23s -> 1458.23s]  What the hell are you thinking?
[1458.23s -> 1461.05s]  And I'd say, well, I wanted it to have fun.
[1461.05s -> 1462.05s]  And he'd go,
[1462.05s -> 1465.05s]  Get out of my office before I slap you.
[1465.05s -> 1467.35s]  I don't know why my doctor's slapping me.
[1467.35s -> 1470.49s]  Something ill is going on there.
[1470.49s -> 1473.49s]  I can't even, like, figure this out with anybody.
[1473.49s -> 1479.76s]  No, no.
[1481.76s -> 1484.76s]  Oh, I know what the title of this video is gonna be.
[1484.76s -> 1490.26s]  Uninstall game is gonna be the title of this video.
[1490.26s -> 1494.27s]  Oh, Super Meat Boy.
[1494.27s -> 1496.27s]  Uninstall the damn game.
[1496.27s -> 1499.64s]  If that's not the title, then I don't know what should be.
[1499.64s -> 1502.33s]  No, I was there.
[1502.33s -> 1504.33s]  I was there, man.
[1504.33s -> 1507.08s]  How are you gonna do me like that?
[1507.08s -> 1510.28s]  I'm gonna get Game Genie
[1510.28s -> 1513.28s]  and put the cheat codes into this stupid game.
[1513.28s -> 1516.16s]  Now you know you're starting to get mad
[1516.16s -> 1518.16s]  when you start to call the game names
[1518.16s -> 1520.16s]  and say it's bad and not a good game.
[1520.16s -> 1524.59s]  That's how you know that you're really getting pressed.
[1524.59s -> 1527.75s]  No, whoa, whoa.
[1527.75s -> 1529.75s]  I just had, like, a little bit of lag right there.
[1529.75s -> 1530.75s]  What's going on with the lag?
[1530.75s -> 1533.44s]  Can you guys...
[1533.44s -> 1535.13s]  No.
[1535.13s -> 1538.13s]  Oh, my good God.
[1538.13s -> 1542.58s]  I'm gonna hire somebody to come beat this level for me.
[1542.58s -> 1548.70s]  1-800-get-someone-to-beat-the-damn-level-for-you.org.com.
[1548.70s -> 1550.70s]  slash.edu
[1550.70s -> 1553.78s]  I...
[1553.78s -> 1555.78s]  See, right now, I'm just so bad.
[1555.78s -> 1558.22s]  I can't even concentrate on what I'm doing.
[1558.22s -> 1560.22s]  And this isn't even the hardest thing that's gonna happen.
[1560.22s -> 1562.90s]  This is actually pretty tame.
[1562.90s -> 1565.66s]  I gotta get that guy away from that.
[1565.66s -> 1566.66s]  That's the number one thing.
[1566.66s -> 1568.66s]  Get this guy away from that.
[1568.66s -> 1570.54s]  No.
[1570.54s -> 1573.54s]  I...
[1573.54s -> 1578.85s]  Now I'm just getting sad.
[1578.85s -> 1582.15s]  I've been on this level for, like, 15 minutes.
[1582.15s -> 1586.93s]  Now I'm just making careless mistakes.
[1586.93s -> 1593.29s]  By the end of this, I'm gonna buy a new controller
[1593.29s -> 1595.29s]  because this one is going across the room.
[1595.29s -> 1598.87s]  Hey, Wall.
[1598.87s -> 1599.87s]  Nice to meet you, Wall.
[1599.87s -> 1601.87s]  My name's Jerma's Controller.
[1601.87s -> 1603.87s]  I'm about to be thrown into you
[1603.87s -> 1607.11s]  and shatter into a million pieces.
[1607.11s -> 1611.08s]  All right, I'm gonna be totally silent.
[1611.08s -> 1624.07s]  Oh, crap.
[1624.07s -> 1628.00s]  Just...
[1628.00s -> 1633.14s]  Is this the last level?
[1633.14s -> 1635.09s]  Screw this.
[1635.09s -> 1637.09s]  Is this the last level before the boss?
[1637.09s -> 1639.09s]  Oh, no!
[1639.09s -> 1643.74s]  There's, like, four more levels after this.
[1643.74s -> 1656.60s]  Gotta get that guy away from that.
[1656.60s -> 1659.22s]  Okay, he's gone.
[1659.22s -> 1662.38s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[1662.38s -> 1663.38s]  Easy, easy.
[1663.38s -> 1666.56s]  Don't lose it here.
[1666.56s -> 1673.90s]  Oh, my God, there's even more.
[1673.90s -> 1675.90s]  There's even more.
[1675.90s -> 1677.97s]  Oh!
[1677.97s -> 1681.96s]  Oh!
[1681.96s -> 1684.22s]  Oh!
[1684.22s -> 1688.06s]  Now this guy's over here.
[1688.06s -> 1691.65s]  He's gonna get me.
[1691.65s -> 1694.59s]  Now, how am I supposed to get this without...
[1694.59s -> 1697.59s]  Oh, you have to jump a tiny bit.
[1697.59s -> 1701.22s]  Get out of here.
[1701.22s -> 1703.30s]  Oh!
[1703.30s -> 1704.30s]  Oh, come on.
[1704.30s -> 1707.50s]  Just get her.
[1707.50s -> 1710.91s]  Wow.
[1710.91s -> 1712.91s]  Could you give me some other level to deal with?
[1712.91s -> 1714.92s]  I don't care.
[1714.92s -> 1717.92s]  I'm so, so sick of dying on that last level.
[1717.92s -> 1721.78s]  Oh, of course.
[1721.78s -> 1722.78s]  I run right into that.
[1722.78s -> 1729.04s]  Oh.
[1729.04s -> 1733.04s]  This is the sound you make when you're depressed.
[1733.04s -> 1735.04s]  When you're depressed, you...
[1735.04s -> 1738.90s]  Come on.
[1738.90s -> 1743.04s]  Now I can do this.
[1743.04s -> 1745.04s]  It's getting close, guys.
[1745.04s -> 1753.04s]  I'm getting really close to either biting, throwing, or punching everything around me.
[1753.04s -> 1755.04s]  My whole desk is going down.
[1755.04s -> 1761.73s]  I'm going to drop a nuclear bomb of just destruction on my desk.
[1761.73s -> 1768.58s]  There's going to be no remnants of this desk.
[1768.58s -> 1769.58s]  Go!
[1769.58s -> 1773.10s]  Yeah, go ahead and shoot your saw blades at me.
[1773.10s -> 1774.53s]  Do it again.
[1774.53s -> 1781.48s]  Oh, there's so much difficulty in these levels.
[1781.48s -> 1785.06s]  So much difficulty.
[1785.06s -> 1792.78s]  Literally, I think that really the only way you could beat this game is if you play each level 5,000 times.
[1792.78s -> 1795.95s]  That's really the only way you can successfully get through some of this stuff.
[1795.95s -> 1797.38s]  Shoot it at me.
[1797.38s -> 1799.38s]  Why didn't you shoot it at me?
[1799.38s -> 1803.10s]  I don't even want to know how long this video is going to be.
[1803.10s -> 1806.10s]  This is going to take like 16 hours to upload.
[1806.10s -> 1809.04s]  General Plays Chapter 5.
[1809.04s -> 1810.04s]  Whatever the...
[1810.04s -> 1811.60s]  F...
[1811.60s -> 1812.60s]  S-H-I...
[1812.60s -> 1815.60s]  Capital D-A...
[1815.60s -> 1820.17s]  All right.
[1820.17s -> 1822.86s]  Last time I was quiet.
[1822.86s -> 1823.86s]  I did it.
[1823.86s -> 1824.86s]  So time to be quiet.
[1824.86s -> 1833.94s]  Shoot at me, you mother...
[1833.94s -> 1837.46s]  How did that get in there?
[1837.46s -> 1842.03s]  Shoot it.
[1842.03s -> 1856.50s]  This is not even turning into a...
[1856.50s -> 1862.50s]  This is turning from a let's play into a whirlwind of fury.
[1862.50s -> 1864.44s]  You know what?
[1864.44s -> 1865.44s]  That's actually a pretty good title.
[1865.44s -> 1867.44s]  I think that's what I'm going to call this video.
[1867.44s -> 1869.44s]  Whirlwind of fury.
[1869.44s -> 1874.56s]  I just got to get up there quick.
[1874.56s -> 1875.56s]  Quickly.
[1875.56s -> 1876.56s]  Shoot it.
[1876.56s -> 1877.56s]  Shoot it.
[1877.56s -> 1881.72s]  Get another break.
[1881.72s -> 1885.84s]  Whew.
[1885.84s -> 1888.36s]  Where's auto?
[1888.36s -> 1889.36s]  I need like...
[1889.36s -> 1890.36s]  I need comfort from my dog.
[1890.36s -> 1893.11s]  That was ridiculous.
[1893.11s -> 1895.70s]  Almost done.
[1895.70s -> 1896.70s]  Two more levels.
[1896.70s -> 1897.70s]  That's it.
[1897.70s -> 1900.09s]  Hey, I got the band-aid.
[1900.09s -> 1908.82s]  Oh, I can only imagine how terrible this is going to be.
[1909.82s -> 1910.82s]  Wow.
[1910.82s -> 1911.82s]  No way.
[1911.82s -> 1914.26s]  I totally forgot about this level.
[1914.26s -> 1915.26s]  This level is atrocious.
[1915.26s -> 1916.26s]  Please.
[1916.26s -> 1917.26s]  No.
[1917.26s -> 1918.26s]  I had...
[1918.26s -> 1919.26s]  Why did I move?
[1919.26s -> 1920.26s]  Why the...
[1920.26s -> 1922.90s]  We're sorry.
[1922.90s -> 1924.90s]  Jerma is experiencing technical difficulties.
[1924.90s -> 1931.34s]  He is currently about to scream every swear he's ever heard in his life.
[1931.34s -> 1933.09s]  Almost.
[1933.09s -> 1934.09s]  Almost.
[1934.09s -> 1935.09s]  That was close.
[1935.09s -> 1936.09s]  That was close.
[1936.09s -> 1937.09s]  Seriously.
[1937.09s -> 1944.91s]  I'm going to put a cereal box.
[1944.91s -> 1946.22s]  Never mind.
[1946.22s -> 1947.22s]  Oh, I got the band-aid.
[1947.22s -> 1948.22s]  Girl, good.
[1948.22s -> 1949.22s]  You're great.
[1949.22s -> 1950.22s]  Good thing you got that band-aid.
[1950.22s -> 1951.71s]  Let's go.
[1951.71s -> 1952.71s]  Just be easy.
[1952.71s -> 1954.53s]  Be careful.
[1954.53s -> 1956.98s]  Because this next part...
[1956.98s -> 1957.98s]  That was my hand on the desk.
[1957.98s -> 1958.98s]  This is the end of the game, right?
[1958.98s -> 1960.42s]  This is like the end of the, like, actual game.
[1960.42s -> 1961.42s]  I'm pretty sure about that.
[1961.42s -> 1964.64s]  All right.
[1964.64s -> 1965.64s]  Time to be silent.
[1965.64s -> 1968.16s]  Just going to sit right...
[1968.16s -> 1969.16s]  Never mind.
[1969.16s -> 1970.16s]  This is so horrible.
[1970.16s -> 1971.16s]  This is horrible.
[1971.16s -> 2026.56s]  I wish I could just stand, like, just bob up and down here.
[2026.56s -> 2029.85s]  I could probably be easier dodging things.
[2029.85s -> 2033.05s]  I'm going to get hit with a missile.
[2033.17s -> 2034.17s]  Not yet.

[2099.24s -> 2100.24s]  Not yet.
[2100.56s -> 2101.96s]  Now get in there.
[2101.96s -> 2107.23s]  Get...
[2107.23s -> 2108.23s]  Oh.
[2108.23s -> 2110.37s]  Ooh.
[2110.37s -> 2112.95s]  Happy time.
[2112.95s -> 2113.95s]  Happy...
[2113.95s -> 2115.95s]  Just think about a happy place in your life.
[2115.95s -> 2117.75s]  Think about grandma's cookies.
[2117.75s -> 2126.29s]  Think about how delicious grandma's cookies are and how much you love going to summer
[2126.29s -> 2128.59s]  camp when you were a kid.
[2128.59s -> 2136.78s]  And you gotta think of your favorite ice cream, my chocolate, and how much you want to strangle
[2138.11s -> 2139.11s]  you.
[2139.11s -> 2141.31s]  No, no.
[2141.31s -> 2142.31s]  We gotta think happy thoughts here.
[2142.31s -> 2143.31s]  No.
[2143.31s -> 2144.74s]  We gotta get happy thoughts.
[2144.74s -> 2146.14s]  Will you blow it up already?
[2146.14s -> 2147.14s]  Oh.
[2147.14s -> 2148.14s]  Would you blow it up already?
[2148.14s -> 2150.34s]  How did...
[2150.34s -> 2151.34s]  Oh, wow.
[2151.34s -> 2153.58s]  That was a stroke of just weird luck that it didn't hit me.
[2153.58s -> 2157.83s]  Okay.
[2157.83s -> 2158.83s]  I can take a second here.
[2158.83s -> 2160.78s]  Take a second.
[2160.78s -> 2162.95s]  I don't care about the A+.
[2162.95s -> 2163.95s]  Just want to go.
[2163.95s -> 2164.95s]  Go.
[2164.95s -> 2167.86s]  Go.
[2167.86s -> 2168.86s]  Go.
[2168.86s -> 2169.86s]  This guy.
[2169.86s -> 2170.86s]  Don't even think about killing me.
[2170.86s -> 2173.76s]  Don't even think about it.
[2173.76s -> 2174.76s]  Okay, guys.
[2174.76s -> 2178.90s]  We have successfully made it to level 20 of Rapture.
[2179.18s -> 2181.31s]  And...
[2181.31s -> 2182.71s]  Dude, this guy is relentless.
[2182.71s -> 2183.71s]  Get out of here, man.
[2183.71s -> 2188.70s]  You know, I gotta get these guys out of here.
[2188.70s -> 2190.18s]  This guy cannot be over here with me.
[2190.18s -> 2192.30s]  I gotta get him all over on this side.
[2192.30s -> 2193.30s]  So you come up with me.
[2193.30s -> 2194.30s]  Go ahead.
[2194.30s -> 2197.04s]  Come on, you piece of crap.
[2197.04s -> 2202.13s]  Come on, you stupid piece of crap.
[2202.13s -> 2204.77s]  Just this and then I have to beat Dr. Fetus, I think.
[2204.77s -> 2205.77s]  Oh, all three of them.
[2205.77s -> 2206.77s]  Come on over here.
[2206.77s -> 2210.10s]  Why not all three of you?
[2210.10s -> 2213.78s]  It actually turned out to be for the better, apparently.
[2213.78s -> 2214.78s]  There's still...
[2214.78s -> 2215.78s]  All three of them still here.
[2215.78s -> 2216.78s]  Oh, this is not possible.
[2216.78s -> 2217.78s]  This is not possible.
[2217.98s -> 2218.98s]  This is not possible.
[2218.98s -> 2219.98s]  This is impossible.
[2219.98s -> 2220.98s]  This is impossible.
[2220.98s -> 2225.78s]  Oh, and the blade kills me.
[2225.78s -> 2238.80s]  You guys just go fast so they can't come near you.
[2238.80s -> 2240.74s]  Get back over here.
[2240.74s -> 2241.74s]  I'm going to...
[2241.74s -> 2242.74s]  Not good.
[2242.74s -> 2245.33s]  Not good.
[2245.33s -> 2246.33s]  Not good.
[2246.33s -> 2259.49s]  At least there's only two now to just smoke me in one second.
[2259.49s -> 2263.13s]  See there's like so many other nice things I could be doing like right now.
[2263.13s -> 2265.53s]  I could be going for a walk.
[2265.57s -> 2272.09s]  I could be singing a song on like karaoke machines.
[2272.09s -> 2277.32s]  I could be at Burger Boys laughing.
[2277.32s -> 2285.04s]  But no, I'm stuck on level 20 of Super Meat Boy Rapture.
[2285.04s -> 2286.52s]  Oddly enjoying this though.
[2286.52s -> 2287.52s]  I don't know why.
[2287.52s -> 2292.12s]  Typically when I rage at games, I get very, very mad, but not right now.
[2292.12s -> 2293.12s]  But you know what?
[2293.12s -> 2294.44s]  It's time to shut up and beat the Dlamia level.
[2294.44s -> 2295.44s]  Let's go.
[2295.44s -> 2299.69s]  Get...
[2299.69s -> 2301.77s]  Oh my good gravy.
[2301.77s -> 2307.33s]  The inside of the dish, it's thick and it's gross.
[2307.33s -> 2313.39s]  Even though gravy is actually pretty delicious.
[2313.39s -> 2315.71s]  I want to find a guy that created this character.
[2315.71s -> 2319.39s]  Whoever like made this character, I want to punch him in the face.
[2319.39s -> 2328.24s]  Because this is the most annoying thing I've come across in this entire damn game.
[2328.24s -> 2338.91s]  God damn.
[2338.91s -> 2339.91s]  Finally get the...
[2339.91s -> 2347.54s]  Get away from me.
[2347.54s -> 2360.80s]  Now I just don't die here like an idiot.
[2360.80s -> 2362.36s]  And he came with me.
[2362.36s -> 2366.16s]  No surprise there.
[2366.16s -> 2369.32s]  Over here.
[2369.32s -> 2374.06s]  My hand hurts.
[2374.06s -> 2379.98s]  I really am curious as to how many people bought this game and then just never played
[2379.98s -> 2384.64s]  it ever again because of these levels.
[2384.64s -> 2387.88s]  I can't imagine the amount of people that have been like, oh, let me get Super Meat
[2387.88s -> 2388.88s]  Boy.
[2388.88s -> 2391.85s]  It looks like a fun game.
[2391.85s -> 2392.85s]  I can't beat it.
[2392.85s -> 2396.74s]  Oh, that was a miss.
[2396.74s -> 2398.14s]  I can't believe I didn't die from that.
[2398.14s -> 2400.38s]  Now just run back and forth.
[2400.38s -> 2401.38s]  That's it.
[2401.38s -> 2402.38s]  Drop down.
[2402.38s -> 2403.38s]  Go.
[2403.38s -> 2405.33s]  Don't die here.
[2405.33s -> 2406.33s]  Go.
[2406.33s -> 2407.33s]  Don't be a complete idiot.
[2407.33s -> 2409.78s]  No, that wasn't that.
[2409.78s -> 2412.61s]  That wasn't not what I wanted to do.
[2412.61s -> 2414.17s]  Go.
[2414.17s -> 2420.86s]  Oh, at the boss now.
[2420.86s -> 2426.79s]  Housers.
[2426.79s -> 2427.79s]  Larry's lament.
[2427.79s -> 2430.31s]  Let's go.
[2430.31s -> 2433.07s]  Where am I?
[2433.07s -> 2436.71s]  There's a button I'm going to press and you're going to be in trouble.
[2436.71s -> 2437.71s]  Locked in.
[2437.71s -> 2439.02s]  What the hell is this?
[2439.02s -> 2440.02s]  What?
[2440.02s -> 2441.02s]  What the hell is that thing?
[2442.02s -> 2446.12s]  Well, you're weird.
[2446.12s -> 2447.12s]  I know.
[2447.12s -> 2449.16s]  And so is my brother and my other brother.
[2449.16s -> 2450.16s]  And we're all twins.
[2450.16s -> 2451.16s]  Did you know?
[2451.16s -> 2452.16s]  Can you notice?
[2452.16s -> 2453.16s]  Yeah, I noticed.
[2453.16s -> 2454.16s]  Let's go.
[2454.16s -> 2458.02s]  I remember how to do this.
[2458.02s -> 2459.02s]  Kind of.
[2459.02s -> 2462.58s]  They pop out of different places in the map and you got to run them into the blades.
[2462.58s -> 2463.58s]  That's all I remember.
[2463.58s -> 2465.01s]  Somebody jump into it.
[2465.01s -> 2467.34s]  Somebody jump into the blades.
[2467.34s -> 2468.34s]  No.
[2468.34s -> 2473.61s]  I'm going to stand right here.
[2473.61s -> 2476.38s]  No.
[2476.38s -> 2477.38s]  Hey.
[2477.38s -> 2478.38s]  Well, why don't you come over this way, you bastards?
[2478.38s -> 2482.18s]  That's one.
[2482.18s -> 2483.18s]  Then they run along.
[2483.18s -> 2484.18s]  I know they run across the edge.
[2484.18s -> 2485.54s]  I know that's one of them does that.
[2485.54s -> 2488.51s]  All right.
[2488.51s -> 2490.39s]  All right.
[2490.39s -> 2491.39s]  All right.
[2491.39s -> 2492.39s]  That was so close.
[2492.39s -> 2493.39s]  I can't even begin to tell you how close that was.
[2493.39s -> 2496.81s]  Watch out for the little ghouls.
[2496.81s -> 2498.24s]  Ghosts.
[2498.24s -> 2501.38s]  Got to stand right here.
[2501.38s -> 2504.26s]  Oh, I had one dead.
[2504.26s -> 2505.26s]  I had one dead.
[2505.26s -> 2506.69s]  I just did it.
[2506.69s -> 2508.13s]  I prematurely did that.
[2508.13s -> 2510.52s]  Can't stand there.
[2510.52s -> 2511.52s]  That's going to be trouble.
[2511.52s -> 2512.82s]  Should have stood there.
[2512.82s -> 2514.06s]  I should have stood there.
[2514.06s -> 2515.06s]  Come on.
[2515.06s -> 2518.80s]  Come on.
[2518.80s -> 2523.30s]  Right here.
[2523.30s -> 2525.18s]  Come on.
[2525.18s -> 2526.18s]  Do it.
[2526.34s -> 2527.34s]  No.
[2527.34s -> 2528.34s]  Split second more.
[2528.34s -> 2532.40s]  Split second more.
[2532.40s -> 2533.40s]  Just got to get rid of this one.
[2533.40s -> 2535.34s]  Come on.
[2535.34s -> 2547.19s]  Oh, poo in my breakfast.
[2547.19s -> 2548.19s]  I'm a broken man.
[2548.19s -> 2552.12s]  Yeah.
[2552.12s -> 2553.12s]  Land in that.
[2553.12s -> 2558.38s]  Just got to get your other, your siblings to do the same damn thing.
[2558.38s -> 2559.58s]  What even hit me?
[2559.58s -> 2561.22s]  What just hit me right there?
[2561.22s -> 2564.02s]  I'm going to rewind back and I want to see what actually just hit me right there because
[2564.02s -> 2565.02s]  nothing did.
[2565.02s -> 2569.07s]  Over this way.
[2569.07s -> 2570.07s]  I should have waited.
[2570.07s -> 2571.07s]  I never wait, though.
[2571.47s -> 2572.97s]  No.
[2572.97s -> 2573.97s]  Oh.
[2573.97s -> 2574.97s]  Damn it.
[2574.97s -> 2581.82s]  That was a big mistake because now he's going to be alive.
[2581.82s -> 2586.06s]  No.
[2586.06s -> 2587.06s]  I just wanted to.
[2587.06s -> 2588.06s]  Yeah.
[2588.06s -> 2592.63s]  I just.
[2592.63s -> 2594.45s]  Stay here.
[2594.45s -> 2595.45s]  Have him jump into it.
[2595.45s -> 2599.01s]  Now, you just got to stay on this thing and then somebody else will launch into that.
[2599.01s -> 2601.18s]  Well, not right there, but they will.
[2601.18s -> 2602.49s]  Oh, they will.
[2602.49s -> 2605.58s]  Come on.
[2605.58s -> 2606.58s]  No.
[2606.58s -> 2621.78s]  There's a pattern here that I'm missing sort of maybe kind of not really.
[2621.78s -> 2623.14s]  I can't believe I did not.
[2623.14s -> 2627.01s]  I almost died with that.
[2627.45s -> 2628.75s]  Over here.
[2628.75s -> 2629.75s]  Come on.
[2629.75s -> 2631.95s]  I don't get all day.
[2631.95s -> 2632.95s]  He's going to do it again.
[2632.95s -> 2633.95s]  Whoa.
[2633.95s -> 2634.95s]  My game just froze.
[2634.95s -> 2637.19s]  My game just froze.
[2637.19s -> 2641.63s]  That was that was that was really bad.
[2641.63s -> 2643.15s]  Game legit just froze right there.
[2643.15s -> 2645.78s]  That's what I needed.
[2645.78s -> 2646.78s]  All right.
[2646.78s -> 2647.78s]  Now do it.
[2647.78s -> 2650.04s]  Do it.
[2650.04s -> 2651.04s]  Huh.
[2651.04s -> 2652.20s]  I'm not even touching them.
[2652.20s -> 2653.84s]  I didn't even touch that guy.
[2653.84s -> 2664.53s]  Oh, for the love of everything in planet Earth.
[2664.53s -> 2665.53s]  Somebody give me.
[2665.53s -> 2668.18s]  I got it.
[2668.18s -> 2670.12s]  I got it.
[2670.12s -> 2671.68s]  Just don't do anything stupid here.
[2671.68s -> 2673.18s]  And I got this.
[2673.18s -> 2681.84s]  Yeah.
[2681.84s -> 2682.84s]  Jump over him.
[2682.84s -> 2683.84s]  Jump over him.
[2683.84s -> 2687.26s]  Come on.
[2687.26s -> 2689.20s]  No.
[2689.20s -> 2690.20s]  Do your little dumb scream.
[2690.20s -> 2692.85s]  Get over here.
[2692.85s -> 2693.85s]  Come on.
[2693.85s -> 2695.86s]  Do it.
[2695.86s -> 2696.86s]  Please.
[2696.86s -> 2700.02s]  Just jump.
[2700.02s -> 2701.02s]  You're not jumping like I asked.
[2701.02s -> 2702.02s]  Oh, I did it.
[2702.02s -> 2705.94s]  Oh, my God.
[2705.94s -> 2709.18s]  Oh, I killed these guys.
[2709.18s -> 2710.86s]  You killed my minions.
[2710.86s -> 2713.26s]  Now you're going to really pay.
[2713.26s -> 2715.30s]  Oh, no, dude.
[2715.30s -> 2716.30s]  You're not getting away this time.
[2716.30s -> 2719.98s]  I'm absolutely jumping up this cliff and I'm going to grab onto this and you're dead.
[2720.50s -> 2721.50s]  Come on.
[2721.50s -> 2722.93s]  Did I get it?
[2722.93s -> 2725.38s]  You got it.
[2725.38s -> 2732.50s]  OK, guys, that is the end of that.
[2732.50s -> 2737.94s]  Now I think the final thing, the end, is coming up.
[2737.94s -> 2742.92s]  So I think there's only a few levels here.
[2742.92s -> 2743.92s]  Don't worry.
[2743.92s -> 2747.15s]  We'll see it next week.
[2747.15s -> 2751.31s]  Only five, six levels, but they are all going to probably take me as long as this video
[2751.31s -> 2753.26s]  has taken me already.
[2753.26s -> 2755.94s]  Oh, thank you for watching, everybody.
[2755.94s -> 2757.10s]  Really appreciate it.
[2757.10s -> 2762.69s]  So hopefully we can trek to the end of this and I can beat this game without breaking
[2762.69s -> 2763.86s]  something.
[2763.86s -> 2764.86s]  Because I don't want to break anything.
[2764.86s -> 2771.30s]  I came so, so close to doing bad things with this controller.
[2771.30s -> 2772.30s]  But in the end, it's all right.
[2772.30s -> 2773.60s]  It all worked out.
[2773.60s -> 2774.60s]  So thanks again, guys.
[2774.60s -> 2775.60s]  I'll see you all soon.
[2775.60s -> 2777.20s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
