[31.10s -> 81.69s]  Hope that music pumped you up because I'm uh, get pumped up pumped up for that starting stream soon music
[82.01s -> 90.10s]  I'm gonna sit here and play monster ranger. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry
[105.45s -> 126.70s]  Never mind. Hey, uh get sad anybody ever done that before
[126.94s -> 135.13s]  I know a lot of like streamers and youtubers really like pump up and they pump the fuck up their streams. Has anybody made it like
[136.09s -> 149.77s]  A sad music start. We're just like a somber beginning to the stream like
[150.57s -> 154.73s]  Just like hanging out instead of every stream of being like pumping up music
[156.09s -> 158.57s]  every stream starts really really like slow and
[159.45s -> 161.85s]  They like air the grievances in the beginning of every stream
[163.05s -> 165.05s]  Uh, you know, let's let's pump
[165.37s -> 188.26s]  But in all actuality, let me turn this down. Yeah, we're gonna do monster rancher again
[189.86s -> 191.86s]  monster rancher 4 we're gonna close
[192.82s -> 196.38s]  The series here probably with monster rancher 4
[197.26s -> 201.58s]  Unless I decide i'm gonna play the ds ones because the ds ones apparently are really good, too
[202.30s -> 205.18s]  It's just a question of capping
[205.88s -> 207.88s]  The ds which I know you need to mod it
[209.18s -> 212.30s]  So this will probably be the last monster rancher 4 stream
[213.77s -> 216.09s]  I'm really close to a and s rank
[216.81s -> 219.05s]  With one of the monsters and we have a dream team now
[223.77s -> 225.77s]  So we're gonna probably close it up today
[226.90s -> 228.90s]  Tomorrow we're gonna do risk of rain
[228.98s -> 230.42s]  uh taleks
[230.42s -> 231.94s]  wanted to uh
[231.94s -> 233.94s]  Swap the days we were talking about it
[234.02s -> 237.38s]  Downstairs we were saying yeah, we'll just do it on friday. So we'll do that tomorrow
[238.50s -> 241.38s]  And then the day after that is the sakiro gambling stream
[243.43s -> 245.43s]  But welcome though. I didn't even say hello
[246.01s -> 248.01s]  I didn't even introduce the stream at all
[248.01s -> 255.75s]  I just kind of turned on the music and forgot
[258.62s -> 260.62s]  Online game. No, no, no, no, no, no
[261.42s -> 269.70s]  There's a just preface to this there's a reason for this I painted your crying face
[270.34s -> 272.34s]  It's something else. That's for sure
[275.26s -> 277.10s]  I'm gonna skip the music. I'm sorry
[277.10s -> 279.48s]  It's kind of it's speech jamming me
[282.04s -> 284.52s]  But uh, let's turn this off so you can see the screen
[287.27s -> 291.98s]  Push this forward
[291.98s -> 293.98s]  But i'm ready to go
[295.10s -> 298.55s]  Exactly what we left off. We had the five monsters
[299.27s -> 301.58s]  And I don't really know what to do with them
[301.74s -> 303.74s]  I know that four of them are gonna be useless
[307.74s -> 309.82s]  Hold on. Let me see this before we get started
[313.77s -> 319.08s]  Oh my god
[319.08s -> 320.28s]  Look at this
[320.28s -> 327.00s]  I gotta put this like on screen. This is fucking insane
[335.45s -> 337.61s]  No, the music I don't want to hear the music for this
[338.25s -> 339.93s]  This is what i'm talking about
[339.93s -> 341.93s]  It's not supposed to be like this
[342.17s -> 355.27s]  Look at this happy music
[366.22s -> 368.22s]  Thank you. Yeah, man, that's fucking amazing
[376.18s -> 379.22s]  If you're just joining us. Yes, that is on the screen
[379.94s -> 383.35s]  There's a lot of emotions going on right now that I can't really describe to you
[391.29s -> 392.81s]  All right, let's go
[392.81s -> 402.41s]  Another amazing piece of artwork from yenwen. Yeah one at least one or two
[402.57s -> 404.57s]  Probably like three of those are gonna be emotes
[409.29s -> 412.09s]  I mean just have like three different versions of like the crying face
[412.65s -> 414.65s]  One of them really zoomed in
[414.65s -> 426.23s]  That'll be like Jerma Cry
[426.23s -> 430.57s]  Jerma Cry 2, Jerma Cry 3 or Jerma Cry Z for like zoom in
[431.13s -> 436.70s]  Hello everyone. I did several chores today. Hope your rooms are clean
[437.42s -> 439.98s]  Thanks for reminding me. I probably should do that
[444.02s -> 446.02s]  Next time on Jerma Cry Z
[448.78s -> 451.02s]  Jerma my boy. Yeah, that's it. That could be another one
[453.74s -> 455.18s]  but so
[455.18s -> 459.91s]  If you haven't seen the last few or last two monster rancher 4 streams
[461.02s -> 463.02s]  We've ended up with this team of five
[463.59s -> 465.19s]  the unprover
[465.19s -> 466.71s]  the spyroid
[466.71s -> 468.71s]  Roberto who's our main
[468.73s -> 470.73s]  These are just fucking smurfs. The rest are just alts
[471.43s -> 472.97s]  blossom
[472.97s -> 474.97s]  and add rock plus
[478.57s -> 481.67s]  Those are
[481.67s -> 486.73s]  You can tell yeah, you can tell who the main character is here. It actually is kind of funny
[487.21s -> 492.89s]  Because even if I didn't say anything
[492.89s -> 494.89s]  This is just the cast of an anime it is
[499.35s -> 505.70s]  Okay, so you've got main character who's on a mission. This is the one that matters. This is the character that matters
[506.80s -> 508.84s]  menacing
[508.84s -> 510.84s]  Little bit has a kind of a dark past
[511.48s -> 520.31s]  Really powerful really strong. This is the huge guy. There's always a huge guy in anime that has a deep booming voice
[522.98s -> 528.34s]  It's pretty arbitrary to the story but ends up jumping in and hitting somebody with a big punch every couple episodes
[529.82s -> 531.58s]  Here's comic relief
[531.58s -> 536.23s]  Comic relief goofy weird guy. Yeah, he has a voice like this
[538.42s -> 543.94s]  Has sage like advice but is strange beyond measure
[546.52s -> 553.86s]  Uh cute weird stuffed animal that pops up out of somebody's pocket or out of their purse or something
[557.90s -> 572.06s]  Makes a couple of noises is what is the main selling point at hot topic make the noise
[572.86s -> 575.74s]  I'll try
[578.82s -> 584.06s]  I think i'm pretty close, uh, then you got
[585.42s -> 587.42s]  rival
[587.42s -> 593.51s]  You've got best friend rival, but not really as intimidating or cool
[594.15s -> 599.66s]  As main character and ends up getting shown up all the time
[600.14s -> 609.62s]  In almost every other episode and can't stand it and eventually it turns evil because of it. We got the whole team here
[610.02s -> 612.98s]  We've got the whole anime show. You don't even need to watch the show. I just described the whole thing to you
[618.28s -> 626.41s]  He has to die at some point. Yeah, this character is gonna die. I like it. It's a pretty good team
[628.28s -> 637.48s]  It'll take eight seasons. Yeah, I like huge guy. Let's take a look at a schedule
[640.25s -> 651.98s]  I haven't read the manga you're reading it right now huge guy is best guy and huge guy
[652.06s -> 656.54s]  Also, here's the thing about huge guy that maybe about some of you guys that don't know about animated shows
[657.26s -> 658.84s]  huge guy
[658.84s -> 665.05s]  And little funny cute thing somehow become best friends and that you did not think that was gonna happen
[666.78s -> 671.99s]  And in fact eventually through the story little cute thing stuffed animal toy
[673.05s -> 677.61s]  Will be in the pocket of this character after about four or five seasons
[680.28s -> 681.83s]  In fact
[681.83s -> 686.55s]  Some people said well, okay, well and japanese anime. No, no, no, no. No, this happens in shrek
[687.78s -> 696.07s]  This exact character is in shrek, which is an american animated movie. So
[697.51s -> 706.09s]  That happens in american television animated movies as well. All right, let's go
[706.97s -> 717.37s]  Enough of this bullshit donkey and no the dragon. Have you not seen shrek the giant dragon?
[720.79s -> 723.43s]  All right. Let me look at their stats again. I forget everything
[724.70s -> 735.27s]  But I hope we're having a good day. That's the that's the intro. Okay adrock power. What is what adrox moves?
[736.41s -> 737.61s]  all power
[737.61s -> 742.01s]  Okay, probably build power and
[742.97s -> 743.93s]  life
[743.93s -> 748.95s]  This character is terrible. No wonder you're like the second right anime character
[749.51s -> 754.25s]  All right. This is 140 147 is actually pretty good base
[763.58s -> 765.58s]  Because that's not terrible
[766.23s -> 768.23s]  Not terrible base accuracy either
[768.47s -> 772.31s]  You can't nobody can step up to Roberto though. All right spiroid
[773.56s -> 775.88s]  Huge intelligence, right? We've been building it for a while
[776.52s -> 781.82s]  That speed is so bad though
[781.82s -> 783.77s]  All right, so we need
[783.77s -> 784.97s]  life
[784.97s -> 787.00s]  accuracy
[787.00s -> 788.46s]  life
[788.46s -> 792.01s]  Speed I was going full power here
[794.01s -> 796.33s]  And then maybe defense life for now
[798.97s -> 800.41s]  defense
[800.41s -> 806.81s]  So I don't want to there's never a manager for the anime team. That's the thing that sucks about monster rancher 4
[807.29s -> 814.84s]  There's not somebody standing there with a notepad while they all go off on their fucking quests and missions and shit
[817.40s -> 818.36s]  No
[818.36s -> 830.28s]  They all do their own thing. I'm just gonna auto do it for two of them. Here we go. Let's get Roberto done. I want sandbag
[831.91s -> 833.91s]  Yeah, what do we got? Yeah sandbag
[834.47s -> 836.47s]  He's he can rest the next day
[836.47s -> 840.07s]  Who are the two or three characters that I actually care about probably spiroid?
[840.89s -> 841.85s]  Look
[841.85s -> 845.99s]  And we're gonna do speed
[846.15s -> 851.51s]  I really don't care about anybody else. I really don't like i'm sorry. I don't maybe uh, I like the weird little
[852.76s -> 854.76s]  dancing plush toy thing
[858.86s -> 864.06s]  These two actually really don't matter. I'm gonna be honest. So you add rock plus and unprover do not matter
[869.02s -> 875.80s]  How do they ever expect you to manage five fucking monsters? We're gonna end up combining them eventually
[876.20s -> 884.97s]  It's the book trampoline. All right, let's start working on you
[885.93s -> 888.17s]  What did you need? The other two can just be automatic
[888.81s -> 890.98s]  They're just dna bait anyways
[891.06s -> 907.50s]  So intelligence speed let's go with life defense for now and then you can rest and we'll take a look after that
[913.74s -> 915.74s]  No, fuck ad rock didn't do anything
[917.26s -> 919.34s]  Hey, wait, was that was I supposed to do something?
[920.30s -> 930.49s]  Yeah. Yeah, sorry. I'm just managing fucking everybody. This is just a circus
[934.65s -> 938.09s]  Fuck doing tournaments. I should start charging people admission to come in here
[941.72s -> 943.72s]  We've got a dragon that reads books
[943.96s -> 947.35s]  We've got the funny dancing, uh weight lifter
[948.07s -> 954.70s]  We got the juggling act
[954.70s -> 955.58s]  and then
[955.58s -> 958.65s]  We've got the guy that kicks the sandbag
[958.97s -> 961.77s]  Great and then somebody's sleeping over here. Where is he?
[962.33s -> 966.01s]  That's kind of depressing
[966.01s -> 968.09s]  This is so depressing that i'm gonna have to fuse you
[973.10s -> 975.10s]  All right, you know what? He looks like
[975.10s -> 978.62s]  He looks like somebody looks like
[978.68s -> 980.46s]  frozen dog poop
[980.46s -> 984.14s]  Well, like dog shit that's on the sidewalk that nobody picked up after like six months
[988.41s -> 990.57s]  You don't I don't know if you belong here man
[992.63s -> 994.63s]  Okay, let's just go to the weekend
[997.51s -> 1000.30s]  I'm being so mean to him
[1000.30s -> 1003.74s]  Yeah, well that's part of his character arc. He has to prove to the group
[1004.30s -> 1007.58s]  That he's stronger than the main character and he gets close
[1008.82s -> 1017.27s]  Not quite there. Oh
[1018.95s -> 1020.95s]  Roberto has become very mature
[1021.99s -> 1023.99s]  Got to adjust our raising to keep up with it
[1025.74s -> 1028.23s]  This is not good. Um
[1032.68s -> 1035.72s]  Roberto is signed up for this tournament. I gotta get Roberto to a rank
[1036.84s -> 1039.38s]  Before he dies
[1039.38s -> 1041.38s]  So if I win this one this one
[1044.49s -> 1047.61s]  Shit, I still have to find the stupid rock for that guy
[1049.27s -> 1051.77s]  All right new plan
[1051.77s -> 1055.37s]  I'm sending in the troop of morons to go find the thing that the guy wants
[1057.53s -> 1059.53s]  Roberto's not going he's just gonna rest
[1063.93s -> 1071.29s]  And this is perfect for the anime storyline because in every anime whenever the main character is not involved
[1071.77s -> 1073.77s]  They all fumble all over each other
[1073.85s -> 1076.65s]  They're sent on a mission and they can't fucking do it. They're all useless
[1078.42s -> 1084.84s]  And eventually they accidentally complete the mission. I can't wait to see what happens
[1085.88s -> 1087.16s]  uh
[1087.16s -> 1089.08s]  What was it exactly that I needed?
[1089.08s -> 1094.04s]  Did I already get it? Or I need like I need to go explore the jungle because somebody's lost, right?
[1094.68s -> 1103.30s]  That's what happened last time
[1103.30s -> 1108.66s]  Yeah, so we've got to explore the jungle with everybody but Roberto and hope that they can come up with a victory
[1109.38s -> 1111.61s]  So let's rest
[1111.61s -> 1114.49s]  And then we got trampoline everyone needs to be fed too
[1115.13s -> 1117.37s]  How do you feed five people?
[1118.10s -> 1120.10s]  rest tub
[1120.68s -> 1123.48s]  You don't know just automatic who cares you're gonna die anyways
[1125.70s -> 1126.58s]  Okay
[1126.58s -> 1134.07s]  Pretty terrible gains, but that's okay
[1137.34s -> 1139.58s]  Oh, we gotta see the cutest thing in the world. Where is it?
[1141.43s -> 1144.73s]  Where is it?
[1144.73s -> 1146.22s]  Where is it?
[1146.22s -> 1151.51s]  There you are
[1151.51s -> 1153.37s]  You're really hungry
[1153.37s -> 1154.41s]  food
[1154.41s -> 1157.53s]  Uh, do we have we got squid? Do you beef?
[1158.17s -> 1173.42s]  Okay, have a squid beef is for very special occasions. Nah, sorry. Sorry beef is only for main characters
[1176.62s -> 1178.38s]  all right, yeah, have a uh
[1178.38s -> 1187.22s]  Have a banana
[1187.22s -> 1190.58s]  What you don't think that's a pretty good rule that beef is should be only for main characters
[1191.86s -> 1194.58s]  You want me to give the side storyline our character the
[1195.36s -> 1210.92s]  $300 piece of food. What do you like? Have a mango. I'm keeping you around
[1211.32s -> 1215.80s]  I'm kidding. This this is this is this character's gonna stay around for a long time. I'm not getting rid of this one
[1223.85s -> 1228.41s]  We can replace the character with this can be comic relief and cute thing that pops out of somebody's purse
[1228.97s -> 1238.39s]  and every time it shows up the screen goes different like colors behind them and
[1239.72s -> 1255.40s]  Bubbles are on the screen and shit. Oh, you're good. It makes a weird squishy noise. You've already heard me do it
[1255.40s -> 1257.40s]  I don't have to do it twice. All right, everyone's fine. Let's go
[1261.62s -> 1263.62s]  Keeps getting hit in the head
[1264.82s -> 1266.82s]  All right jungle
[1266.82s -> 1270.34s]  Select the troop. Let's go. No Roberto. I don't want
[1271.38s -> 1272.66s]  Should I
[1272.66s -> 1284.70s]  Feel like i'm gonna run into a boss and it's gonna be a waste of time. I mean no
[1285.34s -> 1289.50s]  Can only I can only take three
[1294.98s -> 1296.98s]  Okay, well then we're gonna
[1305.08s -> 1307.72s]  Try to leave spiroid here, but I need to level up
[1308.62s -> 1315.62s]  Now unprover blossom and spiroid. No, this is a good one
[1315.78s -> 1318.98s]  We'll get like the two or three frames of animation of unprover
[1320.50s -> 1326.26s]  Scary going in from behind spiroid out from behind and like looking and peeking with the sweat coming off his head would be perfect
[1326.74s -> 1349.18s]  Okay, so we need to find the people that are here. Somebody's lost here
[1352.44s -> 1354.44s]  It even makes the right noise too
[1355.14s -> 1361.06s]  That's the same noise it makes. Oh, I can't it's it's too scary for me. I'm not sure
[1362.26s -> 1372.30s]  Watch out
[1372.30s -> 1376.01s]  Why do I know all these tropes?
[1376.01s -> 1379.14s]  I don't know because i've seen
[1380.10s -> 1384.26s]  It doesn't take more than seeing like one or two episodes of an anime to know these tropes
[1384.74s -> 1390.18s]  You don't have to be like a seasoned anime veteran to know these things
[1390.82s -> 1392.32s]  This happens in like
[1392.32s -> 1398.34s]  85 of every episode. All right, come on do something here
[1401.50s -> 1404.62s]  machine gun
[1404.62s -> 1406.62s]  All right, you know bring in the real character, please
[1415.75s -> 1417.59s]  Not bad. All right
[1417.59s -> 1423.13s]  All right, so now I have the ability to do like a team up, right?
[1425.78s -> 1427.22s]  What was it square?
[1427.22s -> 1431.37s]  Was a circle. What was the button to have somebody jump in from the other side?
[1436.92s -> 1438.92s]  Oh, there it is. Okay, it's x
[1444.84s -> 1447.88s]  That was just the anime that was the uh, that's perfect
[1448.76s -> 1451.40s]  Yeah, I don't need to do I need to explain that. Oh, you know what happened?
[1452.12s -> 1454.68s]  Big character did all the work
[1454.76s -> 1460.92s]  Little funny plush toy character jumps out at the end gets the last hit and goes like yeah, you take that
[1463.42s -> 1478.15s]  Oh, it's perfect
[1478.15s -> 1480.44s]  Maybe we'll flex
[1480.44s -> 1486.20s]  And when they flex there's a goofy boom big explosion of like muscles, but they're not real
[1486.28s -> 1490.68s]  It's just a cute thing with muscles like big muscles that show when they inflate for a second
[1493.27s -> 1496.23s]  And then after holding that pose for more than a couple seconds
[1497.19s -> 1499.19s]  It's like the air comes out of them
[1499.19s -> 1515.29s]  And a big sweat mark comes on the head. How the fuck is he level eight?
[1517.30s -> 1538.76s]  I feel like he hasn't done anything. We get it. Yes, we get it. You watch anime
[1539.72s -> 1545.05s]  I really don't though. I do not that often but I do
[1545.69s -> 1557.29s]  Maybe like twice. I've seen at least two of them. I work at an animation studio. I'd like to hire you
[1558.09s -> 1560.09s]  Me you'd like to hire me
[1560.81s -> 1564.65s]  I'm not so sure about that
[1564.65s -> 1566.65s]  But what if I don't do my job? Well, I
[1570.10s -> 1572.10s]  Guess I could try
[1576.60s -> 1578.60s]  and fired
[1583.70s -> 1586.66s]  That's right. You are in charge of everybody on the team
[1586.90s -> 1588.90s]  Oh
[1588.90s -> 1591.78s]  Okay, everybody. Oh finally everybody has to listen to me
[1593.48s -> 1594.84s]  Line up everyone
[1594.84s -> 1601.22s]  And then they just like they just like fucking stampede over him. He just still doesn't have any power. He thought he did
[1611.16s -> 1612.36s]  Now, let's try
[1612.36s -> 1620.79s]  What's this?
[1620.79s -> 1623.10s]  Do it. Come on
[1623.10s -> 1631.21s]  So I love somebody's rights. Can you stop this? I don't know if I haven't I don't know if I can turn it off
[1631.77s -> 1639.91s]  Well, that's amazing
[1639.91s -> 1645.93s]  Was it a cake?
[1645.93s -> 1648.81s]  Okay, blossom. What do you got?
[1648.87s -> 1651.85s]  hyper beam
[1651.85s -> 1653.13s]  head attack
[1653.13s -> 1672.47s]  We'll see you overrun. I love it. Nobody can do oh wait. What was it? Let me take a look head attack
[1674.57s -> 1677.05s]  Exactly what that image should look like
[1678.47s -> 1683.98s]  very high accuracy rating
[1683.98s -> 1687.98s]  Not very much life, but good crit and good accuracy and it doesn't take very much guts
[1694.50s -> 1696.82s]  This thing is amazing. If you start off with this every time
[1697.78s -> 1703.51s]  You could just drain them. Oh wait, wait, that wasn't I got something else too, didn't I?
[1705.30s -> 1708.39s]  hyper beam
[1708.39s -> 1709.51s]  beams
[1709.51s -> 1711.67s]  Apparently eventually they're gonna get a beam
[1726.57s -> 1729.22s]  B's no beam
[1729.22s -> 1731.22s]  B E A M
[1739.43s -> 1741.51s]  B E A M
[1741.51s -> 1743.51s]  M as in Michael
[1743.67s -> 1750.28s]  You guys ever get on the phone with somebody that does that for every other word and you kind of just like you don't need to do that
[1756.57s -> 1760.73s]  Yeah, you coming to the party? Yeah. Yeah, i'm coming to the party. You got you got the address, right?
[1761.05s -> 1763.93s]  Yeah, I think so. I think I got it. What was it? One? Uh, what was it? Just tell me one more time

[1798.97s -> 1812.15s]  nice
[1812.31s -> 1814.31s]  Hey
[1814.63s -> 1817.91s]  Why was it w e a guy was even spelling it wrong
[1829.29s -> 1830.73s]  West
[1830.73s -> 1832.73s]  Yeah, if you're gonna do that, you at least give me the right
[1833.61s -> 1843.14s]  spelling
[1843.14s -> 1845.14s]  a as an i i ya
[1848.30s -> 1859.21s]  What?
[1859.21s -> 1865.98s]  Nobody can help me do that
[1865.98s -> 1870.86s]  Why did you say that? What did I say? I said somebody wrote. I don't know what that is. Oh, that's the okay
[1870.86s -> 1877.78s]  Never mind. I don't know if that is
[1877.78s -> 1884.95s]  I know what that is
[1884.95s -> 1887.19s]  Sure you I prove it. I'm not gonna prove that
[1890.26s -> 1903.21s]  I know what it is
[1903.21s -> 1907.34s]  What is it then? It's the
[1908.65s -> 1935.99s]  It's the emote it's like an emote on twitch hit it. All right, I gotta play out. We see in the classroom
[1936.07s -> 1941.83s]  There is uh, the the girl's name is ayayo, right? And then uh, what happens is she doesn't understand her
[1941.83s -> 1945.51s]  She thought she's saying ayaya. So she ends up screaming ayaya like that's your name
[1945.51s -> 1948.07s]  She's going around the room pointing at people's names and giving them
[1948.71s -> 1952.55s]  Their names when they tell her but she's confused with ayayo because she doesn't understand that one
[1952.55s -> 1958.07s]  She's thinking and they keep going back and forth about ayayo or ayaya and then um,
[1958.47s -> 1978.07s]  You end up watching like a 15 hour version of it on youtube. I know what it fucking is
[1990.07s -> 1994.95s]  He looked it up like right now you like yeah like while i'm doing inputs and sitting here right now
[1994.95s -> 2010.73s]  Did you hear a keyboard press? No, it's called it's called like a few months ago
[2011.74s -> 2013.82s]  I had no idea what the fuck that was
[2014.62s -> 2018.94s]  And I was and saw it everywhere and I saw references to it. I'm like, I don't know what this is
[2018.94s -> 2020.94s]  So I searched it and I read about it
[2021.34s -> 2024.42s]  And now I know the whole entire story
[2024.74s -> 2029.48s]  It's called informing yourself and then seeing the facts presented in front of you and knowing what it is
[2047.46s -> 2049.06s]  Oh funny glasses
[2049.06s -> 2064.39s]  Can I can give those to me? I like those bro. They're facts facts
[2076.63s -> 2092.28s]  Funny glasses distract me. What was that? What did I just pick up? I can't go into data on my data
[2101.67s -> 2105.83s]  I did get distracted. You're right
[2105.83s -> 2111.54s]  It worked
[2111.54s -> 2115.78s]  Although somebody wrote I didn't even know what that meant and he does why?
[2116.74s -> 2122.97s]  It's because I typed it in and I looked up what it meant because I didn't know because I saw it everywhere
[2131.45s -> 2134.65s]  Guys, i've done the same thing with other emotes on twitch that I didn't understand
[2137.18s -> 2140.78s]  Like sour, please. I kept seeing it. I didn't know what it was and i'm like what the fuck is this
[2141.42s -> 2143.78s]  It's a guy like dancing in wal-mart
[2144.18s -> 2146.90s]  And I looked it up. It was from a video of a guy dancing in wal-mart
[2160.41s -> 2165.82s]  Oh, come on. How much gust damage is how much does do
[2166.46s -> 2172.78s]  That does 29 guts damage. That's pretty good damage. Actually. What about let's try that. No bring come back out here
[2173.34s -> 2174.95s]  Let's try the headbutt
[2174.95s -> 2179.24s]  I mean, that's that's the cutest thing ever
[2182.01s -> 2184.33s]  Not bad damage either for it being a shitty move
[2185.61s -> 2187.61s]  With no power levels up
[2193.27s -> 2195.27s]  Nice counter stupid
[2202.07s -> 2204.07s]  It's the eye from monster rancher one
[2204.86s -> 2206.62s]  Dude, what?
[2206.62s -> 2211.70s]  What a fucking easter egg
[2211.70s -> 2213.78s]  hard head
[2213.78s -> 2215.78s]  and mastered kiddie punch
[2223.16s -> 2225.16s]  Look at this
[2226.31s -> 2228.28s]  Kiddie punch
[2228.28s -> 2230.28s]  Apparently it does a lot of damage
[2234.82s -> 2237.30s]  10 it's only 10 guts to do this
[2238.65s -> 2240.65s]  Oh, it's a terrible accurate
[2241.21s -> 2243.21s]  The accuracy is awful
[2244.04s -> 2246.50s]  I don't know man
[2246.50s -> 2247.68s]  you build
[2247.68s -> 2249.69s]  accuracy
[2249.69s -> 2252.49s]  With this character and just spam this move over and over again
[2255.93s -> 2273.10s]  And hard head is moves that use your head. What is the most useless body part?
[2274.33s -> 2276.95s]  um
[2276.95s -> 2278.95s]  I mean, that's kind of a weird question
[2283.26s -> 2287.82s]  Okay, I was I didn't you just said body part and I just I see lungs on the screen here
[2288.76s -> 2292.36s]  Lungs are very important, but I mean that's that's a pair of lungs. You just said body part
[2292.36s -> 2294.36s]  And that's my brain just turned that into a pair of lungs
[2294.68s -> 2295.80s]  um
[2295.80s -> 2298.33s]  What's the most useless body part? Okay, let's think about this
[2302.44s -> 2309.75s]  uh
[2309.75s -> 2311.75s]  I mean, yeah, like your appendix doesn't do anything
[2315.82s -> 2317.18s]  battle cards
[2317.18s -> 2320.50s]  Your appendix doesn't do anything
[2328.15s -> 2331.75s]  Your your nails. Yeah, like your toenails your nail like
[2332.31s -> 2336.31s]  You know that there's a theory that we're gonna evolve off our fingernails and toenails, right?
[2338.10s -> 2342.58s]  Over a million years if humans are still around we're you're gonna evolve off no fingernails
[2346.02s -> 2348.02s]  Oh this again, i've talked about this before
[2352.38s -> 2358.70s]  No, look it up. Look i'm serious. Look it up. Hey, you know the thing that I did called this
[2359.26s -> 2362.88s]  facts and knowledge and data from like the institute of technology
[2379.03s -> 2381.03s]  Which institute of technology
[2383.83s -> 2386.70s]  That's easy
[2386.70s -> 2389.18s]  The reblog from my grandmother's facebook
[2391.54s -> 2394.04s]  It says it on the bottom right
[2394.20s -> 2398.60s]  Institute of technology
[2398.60s -> 2413.58s]  It has to be real
[2413.58s -> 2417.70s]  Which institute of technology the institute of technology?
[2426.52s -> 2428.38s]  flight ride
[2428.38s -> 2429.82s]  grave throw
[2429.82s -> 2444.54s]  All right flight ride
[2445.02s -> 2448.94s]  Let's you ride your monster and fly over ops. Oh, okay. I can finally do that now
[2449.50s -> 2451.50s]  I can cross the gaps there
[2451.82s -> 2455.00s]  And what is this?
[2455.00s -> 2457.00s]  d by grave throw
[2457.00s -> 2458.20s]  Look at that
[2458.20s -> 2461.91s]  s life damage
[2461.91s -> 2465.37s]  Not bad accuracy either
[2465.37s -> 2469.59s]  All right, which one of these sucks?
[2469.59s -> 2472.47s]  So this is a short range so fire is good
[2473.51s -> 2477.11s]  Flutter is mid. So this is d bite life a life s
[2478.58s -> 2481.06s]  Guts 23 30 not a big difference in guts
[2482.86s -> 2488.70s]  Hey, this is just a better move. It takes more guts, but it's just a better move. It'll land more often in general. So
[2489.58s -> 2492.66s]  There's no uh, yeah, let's replace this one
[2504.04s -> 2506.14s]  He's an intelligence monster
[2506.14s -> 2508.14s]  Yeah, but some of those moves are good to have
[2508.62s -> 2510.62s]  If you run up to somebody that has
[2510.86s -> 2513.67s]  um
[2513.67s -> 2518.07s]  You run into somebody that has high intelligence those moves are not going to work
[2518.71s -> 2531.32s]  Can I fly over that?
[2531.32s -> 2532.44s]  Hold on
[2532.44s -> 2538.47s]  Can you fly this?
[2538.47s -> 2543.40s]  I can't like just fly over that, huh?
[2560.06s -> 2562.06s]  Holy my god
[2562.30s -> 2567.90s]  That did a lot of damage. That was a nice crit though. All right, bring it up
[2568.86s -> 2570.73s]  fire in the middle
[2570.73s -> 2574.12s]  blast him
[2574.12s -> 2575.00s]  nice
[2575.00s -> 2585.59s]  Jeremy I bite my own fingers. Do you was that cannibalism?
[2587.56s -> 2589.30s]  um
[2589.30s -> 2594.26s]  I don't know. That's that's a different that's a topic that I don't know if we can even touch on right now because that's
[2595.06s -> 2598.17s]  Depends on who you ask
[2598.17s -> 2600.81s]  Is it auto cannibalism if I bite my fingernails?
[2603.11s -> 2607.27s]  No, because you're not you're not biting your fingernails and eating your fingernails for sustenance
[2608.47s -> 2613.67s]  It's just it's a habit. I'm asking you. Okay. No, I don't think that's cannibal. That's not auto cannibalism
[2613.67s -> 2615.67s]  You're not eating your fingernails for nutrients
[2616.23s -> 2627.54s]  What if I am though? Well, then i'm I really hate to tell you this but you've been doing that really wrong because there's no nutritional value
[2627.62s -> 2629.64s]  In your fingernail
[2629.64s -> 2632.84s]  I don't I don't think it's even calories in your fingernail
[2636.73s -> 2649.43s]  It's like chew. It's like biting. It's like eating wood. Damn it. Holy shit that hurt
[2652.71s -> 2655.43s]  All right, pull them out pull them out. I don't want them to get hurt here
[2658.47s -> 2663.64s]  Nice blossom
[2663.64s -> 2668.71s]  Try it again
[2668.71s -> 2672.39s]  Come on, hit it. Just try to get it. Just try to hit it. Oh my goodness. Not good
[2678.60s -> 2683.10s]  Damn, I always got this stupid thing
[2688.13s -> 2690.13s]  16 chance to hit this
[2691.86s -> 2694.95s]  No
[2694.95s -> 2696.71s]  Oh, come on
[2696.71s -> 2699.19s]  What the fuck? What is this guy? Seriously?
[2702.10s -> 2704.10s]  He's blocking every attack
[2706.22s -> 2708.10s]  They're gonna all die
[2708.10s -> 2712.34s]  Because nobody will do a fucking move. Look at this and he blocks every attack
[2714.97s -> 2716.97s]  Oh my god, give me a break
[2723.26s -> 2731.78s]  Hey

[2762.50s -> 2765.90s]  Like I blocked almost every attack
[2765.98s -> 2771.53s]  60 to 70 percent of every move I tried to do they wouldn't do and he got final guts
[2773.98s -> 2777.26s]  I got fucking party wiped right? Yeah. What the hell was that?
[2777.90s -> 2780.30s]  Genuinely angry. What the fuck was that?

[2805.32s -> 2807.40s]  Decided to block every single move
[2826.46s -> 2828.46s]  That's such a horse shit

[3004.46s -> 3007.18s]  Not intelligent
[3007.18s -> 3010.54s]  I'm so fucking mad right now. I can't believe I don't want to do that again
[3010.62s -> 3024.65s]  I don't want to bring i'm gonna have to bring roberto in there. Can I save scum? No, no, no, that's not necessary
[3025.13s -> 3031.34s]  Go put your ass handed to you again. And I was reading stuff about um
[3032.06s -> 3035.59s]  There are people saying that to add like an easy mode to
[3036.15s -> 3041.99s]  Sekiro
[3041.99s -> 3043.99s]  That's like a current that's a current topic right now
[3053.62s -> 3059.70s]  Was did this happen when like bloodborne came out or dark souls 3 when dark souls 3 came out was there like a no
[3059.70s -> 3062.02s]  But nobody there wasn't a reason for it because you could just over level
[3067.29s -> 3070.01s]  That's true. This is like the first time really this has probably ever happened
[3070.81s -> 3074.33s]  Cuphead yeah, but cuphead had like a casual mode didn't it where you could play like on easy
[3077.06s -> 3084.17s]  It did still happen. I'm of the opinion that like
[3086.82s -> 3093.82s]  Okay, if I go into an art gallery and there's a picture like with like this the scream right and I look at the scream
[3093.82s -> 3095.18s]  And i'm like, huh?
[3095.18s -> 3097.61s]  The scream that's who made that?
[3098.46s -> 3100.46s]  Oh, uh leonardo da vinci
[3100.46s -> 3101.50s]  Oh, okay
[3101.50s -> 3106.94s]  Do you mind you pull up you grip a fucking sharpie off and you like do you mind if I uh go in here for a second?
[3107.34s -> 3113.56s]  What are you doing? What are you doing? You like and you add like a row of teeth on the screen
[3115.74s -> 3119.42s]  It's a church. What the fuck are you doing? And like everyone's gonna like tackle you and like rip you out of there
[3127.40s -> 3133.66s]  I must have what the screen is by edward. I know I know I got it wrong. I just said any painter
[3138.55s -> 3140.55s]  How are teeth in easy mode?
[3142.07s -> 3146.68s]  No, i'm just saying it's like
[3147.88s -> 3153.43s]  Making like an easy mode after the fact I think is not it wouldn't work
[3154.70s -> 3159.50s]  If from the very beginning they decided to do something like that, then I think that would make some sense, right?
[3159.66s -> 3161.66s]  But if the game's already out
[3161.66s -> 3164.06s]  And they retroactively go back and have to change everything
[3166.26s -> 3169.18s]  You know what I mean?
[3169.18s -> 3173.74s]  There are a lot of games that are made from the ground up with like that in mind and that's that's great
[3174.58s -> 3178.41s]  If securo had in like an easy mode at launch
[3179.64s -> 3183.24s]  It's like okay. They said they wanted to do this. They wanted to have it like that. That's fine
[3184.97s -> 3191.08s]  But if it's already done and it wasn't like part of the plan then somebody's give 20 fucking community subs
[3193.30s -> 3206.22s]  Uh great lord wall and thanks for the 20 community subs. Holy shit. Thank you for the 20 fucking subs. That's uh,
[3206.95s -> 3220.04s]  A lot, thank you
[3220.04s -> 3223.00s]  but yeah, I mean I I totally understand the the aspect of
[3224.65s -> 3228.33s]  Like I want to enjoy the game too, right and I don't want to grind
[3229.11s -> 3238.65s]  Ishin for 17 hours, right? I completely understand it, but I think something like that should be like tied into
[3239.45s -> 3250.94s]  How the game is developed in the first place because that shit is fucking hard
[3250.94s -> 3255.90s]  That game is hard hard hard like very fucking hard you've heard you those either watch those streams. Holy shit
[3256.22s -> 3268.78s]  That's one of the hardest things i've ever done. Okay life
[3269.50s -> 3277.75s]  All right, everybody needs to rest because of that shit
[3278.47s -> 3283.91s]  Only reverto can do anything
[3283.91s -> 3288.23s]  You fought the headless guy and had a psychotic breakdown. Yeah, I know that's what i'm saying
[3288.23s -> 3292.31s]  Like it's I understand like what people are talking about when they say like holy shit
[3292.31s -> 3303.26s]  This game is fucking next level
[3303.26s -> 3305.90s]  But in my opinion, I think decisions like that need to be made
[3306.62s -> 3314.50s]  Right at the beginning. All right, everyone needs to eat
[3334.17s -> 3336.17s]  How about uh, you like bananas?
[3336.57s -> 3339.98s]  Uh, wait, wait, are we talking about a germa opinion here?
[3340.70s -> 3351.26s]  But also like look think about this too and I know that some people are gonna like I've given my opinion in my stance
[3351.26s -> 3353.26s]  on that right how I think like
[3353.32s -> 3355.98s]  retroactively adding modes to games that are not
[3356.54s -> 3360.70s]  Baked into the vow the artistic vision of the creator, right?
[3360.78s -> 3362.70s]  I think should be done differently
[3362.70s -> 3371.50s]  But the person that wants to enjoy sakiro they still paid for the product, right? They still paid for it
[3372.14s -> 3374.46s]  and sometimes it can be difficult for
[3375.42s -> 3379.24s]  You think about that like oh like imagine you get like I yeah, I got like two kids
[3380.04s -> 3386.36s]  I gotta go to work and come back. I got like 45 minutes today to play sakiro and you you just add the ogre for four days straight
[3386.84s -> 3389.08s]  You know what I mean?
[3389.08s -> 3393.45s]  Some people just want to like enjoy the experience and that's like a whole nother
[3394.26s -> 3405.05s]  That's a whole nother opinion there. You could just play another game. Yeah, but they still bought it and they still want to like it, right?
[3405.53s -> 3414.78s]  Somebody says having one difficulty means you can balance the game specifically for it
[3415.82s -> 3419.42s]  Yeah
[3419.42s -> 3424.86s]  But but if you have modes like I mean like devil may cry right has like a bunch of hard and easy mode
[3424.86s -> 3429.74s]  The cuphead is one of the hardest games that came out like last year and that that had modes too
[3429.82s -> 3433.14s]  And it wasn't like holy shit. Why are these in here? But it was
[3433.86s -> 3437.62s]  Baked into the game. They like planned for that. They were making that that way
[3449.48s -> 3453.08s]  Yeah, there's no need to be rude to each other. This is this is we can have a very
[3454.20s -> 3456.20s]  Decent conversation with each other
[3460.04s -> 3463.16s]  Sometimes we talk about these things. You don't have to be angry or mean with each other. Come on guys
[3467.62s -> 3469.62s]  I mean, I just beat sakiro
[3470.02s -> 3472.90s]  Last week and I see a lot of people talking about it. So I figured hey
[3475.02s -> 3491.21s]  Why don't we talk about it for a sec? It's interesting. He's flexing on it. I mean, I did just beat sakiro last week
[3491.69s -> 3496.07s]  Okay, everyone's okay
[3496.07s -> 3498.71s]  All right, let's do some training. Wait, no, no, no, when's the tournament?
[3503.18s -> 3512.18s]  It's today. All right, don't train. No, actually you can train today
[3513.56s -> 3522.26s]  You'll be fine. All right. What about everybody else? You need to do no everybody. Look at how fucked up they all still are just rest
[3523.06s -> 3528.44s]  You're the only one that can even do anything
[3549.77s -> 3552.39s]  Okay, let's give you some good food
[3558.98s -> 3560.98s]  Uh, that's not good food
[3561.88s -> 3563.88s]  I was just gonna give you a potato
[3569.72s -> 3572.36s]  All right. Roberto is somebody said Roberto's gonna die
[3573.00s -> 3581.19s]  He's not gonna die yet. He'll be okay
[3581.43s -> 3583.61s]  for like another couple tournaments
[3584.89s -> 3589.19s]  How much time does he have left? What do rocks like to eat?
[3592.20s -> 3594.20s]  You can even have a potato who cares?
[3602.60s -> 3606.20s]  Yeah, but I I didn't want to like open up like a can of worms with that topic
[3606.76s -> 3614.70s]  I just figured it's very very much relevant right now and we talk about relevant things on this channel
[3616.07s -> 3631.99s]  We don't you're good
[3631.99s -> 3633.43s]  so you can now
[3633.43s -> 3638.60s]  Train tomorrow. Let's do we need you to do like life
[3641.34s -> 3645.58s]  No, no, no, you need you had high speed high intelligence. You know, just fucking burn
[3646.44s -> 3652.38s]  Intelligence just do it. We got a tournament
[3656.41s -> 3658.65s]  All right, Roberto. Let's see what you got. You're in b rank now
[3674.97s -> 3677.93s]  All right, Roberto versus lean. This is a dragon. I think
[3681.06s -> 3686.82s]  Look at that 296 intelligence high defense high power. This thing is not to be fucked around with
[3689.43s -> 3691.43s]  Nice and nice lean meat
[3708.65s -> 3711.35s]  Right at the bat. Perfect
[3711.35s -> 3715.19s]  It's a giant sonic the hedgehog. They're always going to be sonic the hedgehog no matter what
[3719.38s -> 3735.62s]  Every one of these will be sonic. I want a statue of beanbag sonic
[3739.38s -> 3741.70s]  All right. Well lean beat
[3741.70s -> 3742.82s]  sunday
[3742.82s -> 3744.82s]  On sunday won the last match
[3745.82s -> 3747.82s]  high power high defense
[3749.22s -> 3755.35s]  All right, it's got a land move that's it at that i'm just i'm stacking power on Roberto
[3762.71s -> 3764.71s]  We're just going for one hit kills
[3765.51s -> 3766.55s]  Uh-oh
[3766.55s -> 3772.65s]  Thank god
[3772.65s -> 3774.65s]  It's so hard to counter that it's so quick
[3782.04s -> 3784.04s]  It was energized. It was energized
[3796.04s -> 3798.62s]  Eden looks like you're not that threatening
[3800.31s -> 3802.31s]  No, not at all. It should be easy
[3807.93s -> 3809.93s]  Sponsored by energizer not quite
[3818.87s -> 3824.90s]  Perfect. Come on. I have to get to give me to a rank. Nice countered it
[3826.95s -> 3832.15s]  All I want is a rank. I don't even need to do s rank. I just want to get to a rank
[3832.55s -> 3836.97s]  Roberto has six months to a year left to live. Okay
[3837.77s -> 3843.90s]  I'll save every month
[3843.90s -> 3847.18s]  I'm gonna drink this five-year-old pac-man energy drink. That's been on my shelf
[3847.90s -> 3849.26s]  Don't do that
[3849.26s -> 3860.50s]  You're gonna insta puke
[3860.50s -> 3863.78s]  Yeah, you will insta puke. I watched somebody do stuff like that
[3864.34s -> 3866.34s]  And then I can't recommend you do that
[3869.21s -> 3870.33s]  paron
[3870.33s -> 3873.85s]  High power, but not that bad shouldn't be that much of an issue
[3886.34s -> 3888.84s]  Huge dog
[3888.84s -> 3893.72s]  Uh-oh, let's go for a power slash
[3896.68s -> 3898.68s]  Oh almost back it up
[3902.92s -> 3904.20s]  You missed it
[3904.20s -> 3908.10s]  Just going for a little tap damage. That's all I wanted
[3916.01s -> 3918.01s]  Somebody said that was a cursed
[3918.63s -> 3929.40s]  inkling
[3929.40s -> 3934.44s]  Uh
[3934.44s -> 3939.66s]  What a what like a very specific reference. All right, this is the guy to beat life 284
[3940.28s -> 3943.16s]  So it looks like he's gonna try to outlast
[3944.07s -> 3946.87s]  No, even if I lose here, it's sunday and I already beat sunday
[3947.59s -> 3952.25s]  Just has really high health
[3952.25s -> 3953.93s]  Why am I not using more?
[3953.93s -> 3958.42s]  midair
[3958.42s -> 3961.90s]  Um, I don't know. It takes too much damage
[3962.54s -> 3967.59s]  Takes too much, uh guts
[3967.59s -> 3980.30s]  pretty good
[3980.30s -> 3982.78s]  I am the victor of this championship tournament
[3989.53s -> 3990.97s]  Roberto wins
[3990.97s -> 3996.26s]  B rank two more tournaments and I win and I can get to A
[3999.69s -> 4004.02s]  A rank
[4004.02s -> 4008.98s]  I got a salmon too. Am I the most popular I can be? This is as popular as you are physically allowed to be
[4009.46s -> 4015.94s]  In a fresh salmon
[4015.94s -> 4017.94s]  He doesn't get to eat it though because he's gonna die
[4018.33s -> 4020.60s]  We're gonna give that to the baby
[4020.60s -> 4022.44s]  All right. We need I need a friend
[4022.44s -> 4024.79s]  Who's friends?
[4024.79s -> 4027.27s]  I need to look at this because if I get six more months
[4033.78s -> 4035.69s]  Who likes each other?
[4035.69s -> 4038.41s]  Roberto and spyroid are good friends
[4042.23s -> 4044.23s]  How do I make them great friends?
[4048.01s -> 4050.81s]  so we need to level up and get spyroid up
[4052.28s -> 4054.09s]  and then
[4054.09s -> 4069.38s]  Combine spyroid and roberto and then have the ultimate being but how do I make them better friends?
[4070.71s -> 4073.83s]  By taking them on adventures together. What if I just bring two of them?
[4081.91s -> 4083.91s]  Blossom does not have any good friends
[4084.76s -> 4089.78s]  That's kind of sad
[4089.78s -> 4091.78s]  Send adrock to the slaughterhouse
[4092.98s -> 4094.79s]  Not yet
[4094.79s -> 4097.99s]  All right. I'm gonna bring spyroid blossom and roberto
[4099.00s -> 4101.24s]  And roberto's gonna steamroll while they all become friends
[4101.88s -> 4118.25s]  Let's save it here. All right. What do we got for tournaments?
[4121.74s -> 4124.86s]  Where is spyroid spyroid I need to win I'm gonna
[4127.61s -> 4132.81s]  I have to I have to stop ranking spyroid up. He's the only other one I really care about besides blossom
[4132.81s -> 4133.85s]  but
[4133.85s -> 4138.01s]  Can I just can they both rank up if they win this one together?
[4143.62s -> 4147.40s]  A fifty dollars just came in
[4147.70s -> 4148.76s]  shala
[4148.76s -> 4151.78s]  shalasha
[4151.78s -> 4154.55s]  Thank you shalasha
[4154.55s -> 4161.34s]  For the fifty dollars five thousand bits and they say your streams are always so unique compared to other streamers
[4161.34s -> 4164.14s]  And that's something that I that I draw a lot of joy from
[4164.62s -> 4167.58s]  This money's chump change compared to what others to what you deserve
[4168.14s -> 4172.78s]  Hope you can continue to bring laughs to your viewers for years to come. Thank you again. You're pretty good
[4176.10s -> 4184.76s]  Thank you for the extremely extremely generous amount of money shalasha shala shal's shala shal's
[4185.24s -> 4191.96s]  the bostonian accent
[4200.71s -> 4208.54s]  Shala shashka shala sha that's the shala shashka got it. What did I say shalashka?
[4209.64s -> 4212.98s]  shalashka
[4212.98s -> 4214.98s]  You ever been to shalashka before?
[4215.22s -> 4219.46s]  It's the most it's the most northwestern state in the entire united states
[4223.86s -> 4230.38s]  But thank you so much, man. Really appreciate it. That's a ton of money and
[4233.08s -> 4238.81s]  Don't don't compare yourself to what other people have given any amount of money is appreciated on this channel
[4238.89s -> 4253.78s]  No matter what what every denomination it is. Let's get uh, let's get spyroid in this tournament
[4255.85s -> 4259.53s]  And then this one we got to start ranking them up because if we're gonna fuse spyroid
[4262.65s -> 4265.69s]  Yeah, if we're gonna we have to just do it. We just have to blow through it
[4267.30s -> 4269.30s]  I don't like that feature
[4270.20s -> 4271.64s]  You know what I mean?
[4271.64s -> 4277.56s]  I don't like the three star feature if he's ready. He's ready. I don't i'm having to do three tournaments. No matter what
[4278.20s -> 4292.22s]  Am I drinking right now? No, i'm not
[4293.40s -> 4296.36s]  No, i'm drinking coffee. I have a cup of coffee in front of me right now
[4297.62s -> 4300.01s]  rest rest
[4300.01s -> 4302.25s]  Rest today because you have a tournament
[4302.49s -> 4304.01s]  You can actually
[4304.01s -> 4305.45s]  just automatic
[4305.45s -> 4308.97s]  for technique
[4308.97s -> 4310.97s]  You can do the book
[4311.96s -> 4313.32s]  and you
[4313.32s -> 4317.58s]  Who cares?
[4317.58s -> 4325.00s]  Okay, let's go for it decent gain
[4331.78s -> 4333.38s]  You're good
[4333.38s -> 4349.99s]  I need food though. I gotta get go to town and get some food. Does this take the whole no it doesn't
[4351.40s -> 4352.68s]  Oh fuck
[4352.68s -> 4359.77s]  I'll do it tomorrow
[4359.77s -> 4361.77s]  Hope we get acting lessons today
[4363.38s -> 4365.75s]  step one
[4365.75s -> 4372.60s]  Imagine the situation you're currently in I really should do an acting lesson stream an acting workshop
[4377.66s -> 4382.14s]  Damn it. I should just bring in
[4383.50s -> 4385.50s]  actors into the studio
[4386.52s -> 4388.52s]  And do an acting workshop on stream
[4398.82s -> 4403.99s]  We'll take maybe we'll get the discord or the chat to vote on
[4404.87s -> 4407.83s]  Slides like scripts teach from movies to do
[4409.99s -> 4417.10s]  Huh? I like this idea actually a lot
[4421.00s -> 4422.84s]  and then at the end
[4422.84s -> 4429.22s]  This takes a little more planning, but at the end maybe chat holds up like a sign of like between zero and ten
[4431.93s -> 4434.17s]  Like the olympics, but it's like the acting olympics
[4435.14s -> 4436.82s]  Why don't they do that?
[4436.82s -> 4442.97s]  How come there's no acting olympics?
[4443.91s -> 4446.15s]  I guess that it's just the academy awards, but
[4450.30s -> 4452.30s]  Because that's mean
[4459.80s -> 4462.02s]  The acting olympics
[4462.02s -> 4466.98s]  You give them different scenarios that they have to do on the fly. They have like an hour to prepare for the scene
[4472.97s -> 4474.97s]  Because it's so subjective
[4476.60s -> 4483.59s]  We see why I think they shouldn't add an easy mode two huge
[4484.31s -> 4486.07s]  animals versus each other
[4486.07s -> 4497.50s]  Look at this one
[4497.50s -> 4498.86s]  Holy shit
[4498.94s -> 4501.10s]  Best character ever best character ever
[4501.66s -> 4508.49s]  Now we have to do that two more times before you can get to d
[4519.72s -> 4521.14s]  fries
[4521.14s -> 4522.50s]  a potato
[4522.50s -> 4535.16s]  Jeremy have you ever heard that some animals can see colors that humans can't you ever wonder what those colors could be?
[4539.90s -> 4541.98s]  No, I have no concept of what that could be
[4547.30s -> 4549.62s]  You know, there's no concept of what that possibly is
[4554.65s -> 4556.81s]  like infrared maybe or
[4558.66s -> 4561.30s]  Anytime I think of a color that I don't know why this is
[4562.02s -> 4566.98s]  Well, whenever I can't think of a color that humans can perceive I always just think of
[4568.23s -> 4571.80s]  The prism the prism color, you know what I mean?
[4574.54s -> 4578.76s]  It's because movies have done that
[4578.76s -> 4580.76s]  It's a color that humans can't see
[4581.82s -> 4585.98s]  And there it is on the screen and it's just like a reflecting prism color
[4586.46s -> 4610.23s]  Okay, you got another one tomorrow life blade. How are you? You're okay rest today and eat I gotta eat bingo right here
[4610.47s -> 4614.15s]  Another competition is scheduled for that. Just yes, we're doing this one instead. God damn it
[4614.79s -> 4617.35s]  Why can't I do more than one?
[4617.35s -> 4620.55s]  sloppy sloppy game design sloppy game
[4621.17s -> 4637.51s]  Sloppy can only do one tournament. How am I supposed to manage five fucking monsters if I can only do one tournament?
[4640.98s -> 4649.02s]  I can't I gotta hire somebody to do the other one. All right schedule. We've got
[4649.56s -> 4658.89s]  Tomorrow we've got a rest. We've got what do you know what my power right? Yeah power and health
[4659.61s -> 4662.49s]  power and accuracy
[4662.49s -> 4668.50s]  Straight up power
[4668.58s -> 4673.88s]  Everybody else you can you can go fuck off. I'm just kidding
[4675.85s -> 4677.66s]  rest
[4677.66s -> 4679.18s]  sandbag
[4679.18s -> 4687.93s]  You can do something and you're on automatic anyways
[4699.32s -> 4711.40s]  Plus 14 power almost a little 20 power. All right, you're good. Let's praise and give I gotta get food
[4714.76s -> 4716.62s]  floppy game design
[4716.62s -> 4724.62s]  Yeah
[4724.62s -> 4728.76s]  No, that salmon is for whoever comes out when I fuse the two of you
[4730.66s -> 4733.37s]  Um, I don't have anything else to give you
[4736.23s -> 4739.32s]  Uh-oh
[4739.32s -> 4741.64s]  Huh? You're gonna have to wait till tomorrow to eat
[4744.07s -> 4746.07s]  Wait, do you have a tournament today?
[4750.68s -> 4755.19s]  Everyone people are hungry
[4755.19s -> 4757.19s]  Uh, who do I give this food to?
[4758.74s -> 4760.39s]  Lee
[4760.39s -> 4763.37s]  I'm so glad you took care of my kids lee my son
[4767.37s -> 4786.38s]  Not so easy. Is it well actually we want you to be okay. Here we go
[4786.70s -> 4788.74s]  You get the beef
[4788.74s -> 4791.54s]  We want you to stick around for a little while because you gotta get it like at least c or b
[4791.86s -> 4808.06s]  He loved it. All right, proceed to the weekend. Give me some town go here. Let's get some more food
[4818.86s -> 4820.94s]  Welcome fain. I would like
[4821.74s -> 4823.66s]  to buy
[4823.66s -> 4826.06s]  A lot of this let's get fuck it. Come on, man
[4826.62s -> 4828.06s]  Get five of them
[4828.06s -> 4833.18s]  Let's get a bunch of bananas
[4838.46s -> 4839.82s]  and
[4839.82s -> 4841.82s]  I need more mangoes
[4844.68s -> 4848.04s]  Uh a couple of squids maybe a couple of squids
[4852.49s -> 4854.25s]  And that's good
[4854.25s -> 4861.67s]  I have so much dumb shit. Look at this
[4862.63s -> 4865.35s]  raises spirit a little during adventures
[4867.26s -> 4869.66s]  Toughens toughness and accuracy a little bit during battle
[4870.46s -> 4876.07s]  I feel like I should just liquidate my inventory but money it doesn't seem to have
[4877.26s -> 4879.26s]  Too much of a purpose yet
[4879.26s -> 4881.26s]  I think it will very soon though
[4881.66s -> 4895.35s]  You sound like orson wells
[4895.43s -> 4899.48s]  What?
[4899.48s -> 4902.76s]  Orson well, it sounds like this. This is kind of the way that he used to talk
[4903.40s -> 4905.78s]  I don't think that I have that kind of inflection
[4906.34s -> 4917.42s]  The beginning and end of most of his words were pulled in a little. Why do I sound like that?
[4923.90s -> 4925.90s]  Young orson. No, I don't
[4927.58s -> 4929.58s]  I don't think young orson wells
[4930.57s -> 4939.14s]  What that's I've I've never heard that before. Okay, we got
[4940.42s -> 4942.42s]  Trampoline that's fine
[4942.60s -> 4944.52s]  Target that's good
[4944.52s -> 4947.08s]  Rest and food and then your tournament
[4948.44s -> 4949.40s]  uh
[4949.40s -> 4951.00s]  you need to
[4951.00s -> 4953.64s]  Rest because you're gonna be very angry and you
[4954.28s -> 4961.06s]  Or something who cares I could go for a mimosa
[4962.54s -> 4966.73s]  Do it up. Look at how bad adrock actually is
[4967.37s -> 4976.52s]  You sound like my cousin orson wells
[4986.20s -> 4990.63s]  All right. Here we go. Let me give you a nice delicious scrumptious
[4992.06s -> 4999.67s]  Mango, you got to be nice and nutrient nutrious eyes for your tournament today
[5000.23s -> 5006.84s]  and you
[5006.84s -> 5014.33s]  You're good. You
[5014.33s -> 5016.09s]  uh have a
[5016.09s -> 5017.13s]  Have a
[5017.13s -> 5033.91s]  Banana there's also the stream the guys there's so many streams that I want to do this summer
[5034.47s -> 5038.01s]  I just need to get in touch with the right people somebody's like bartender
[5038.97s -> 5043.53s]  I want to just like throw a party where i'm the bartender and the stream is just
[5044.17s -> 5046.17s]  I have a party in the studio
[5047.03s -> 5051.19s]  When I just invite a bunch of people and I have to make their drinks for them
[5053.75s -> 5067.38s]  And see if I can do it
[5067.38s -> 5069.38s]  Go get my bartender's license
[5070.46s -> 5073.90s]  And do it it's that you can get a bartender's license in like I think a weekend
[5076.07s -> 5085.46s]  Just for the stream
[5085.46s -> 5087.46s]  Just like invite a bunch of people
[5088.55s -> 5092.63s]  Like streamers youtubers like friends just get them all here
[5093.11s -> 5105.02s]  All right. What do you let me what do you like?
[5105.02s -> 5114.50s]  Okay likes
[5114.50s -> 5116.50s]  trokaten and like just doesn't like to play
[5117.62s -> 5119.94s]  Spyro likes to fight doesn't like to play
[5122.01s -> 5124.01s]  Likes reference doesn't like to sleep, right?
[5127.21s -> 5129.77s]  So blossom likes roses and doesn't like to fight
[5130.41s -> 5133.96s]  He likes fossils and doesn't like to battle
[5135.24s -> 5137.72s]  What do you like for food though?
[5137.72s -> 5139.32s]  high pride cool
[5139.32s -> 5140.52s]  cheerful
[5140.52s -> 5150.39s]  Have a banana
[5150.39s -> 5154.15s]  Imagine having like a room with like 40 50 people in it and i'm making drinks everybody
[5156.33s -> 5159.77s]  And everyone would try. Yeah. Hey, do you think you can fucking make this one?
[5160.65s -> 5162.65s]  And I do and I can
[5162.81s -> 5166.28s]  And i'll be wicked fucking lively and i'll be chatting up everybody
[5167.00s -> 5180.50s]  It'd be so fun
[5180.50s -> 5182.58s]  Rent out a hibachi and try to cook there
[5191.37s -> 5194.03s]  It's like, okay, you know how people do first impression
[5194.91s -> 5198.83s]  For games and stuff what if I did it now hear me out on this
[5199.23s -> 5201.23s]  What have I started doing first impressions?
[5201.87s -> 5203.31s]  on other
[5203.31s -> 5205.16s]  occupations
[5205.16s -> 5206.92s]  like occupations
[5206.92s -> 5208.48s]  chef
[5208.48s -> 5213.42s]  teacher
[5213.42s -> 5214.40s]  detective
[5214.40s -> 5223.10s]  Show like just how difficult these jobs are
[5227.85s -> 5229.85s]  Be go be a pool boy
[5235.42s -> 5238.62s]  Just do like this be a pool boy for a stream
[5239.26s -> 5242.22s]  And give like my first impressions on like being a pool boy
[5249.61s -> 5251.61s]  This is just dirty jobs, but
[5252.62s -> 5256.46s]  Not dirty jobs, not like dirty jobs. This is just
[5257.10s -> 5260.68s]  jobs
[5263.52s -> 5266.66s]  Jobs with jerry b elbertson
[5282.16s -> 5285.16s]  Uh, this is why I like dude, I just
[5287.26s -> 5291.74s]  Some of these things just have to happen
[5291.74s -> 5295.82s]  I'm gonna tell you something right now. I'm gonna i'm gonna I think i'm gonna blow the lid off of one of these things
[5295.90s -> 5297.82s]  That is coming up soon
[5297.82s -> 5300.54s]  Because I need to tell you what it is. I have to talk about it
[5301.02s -> 5303.02s]  Because you have to be ready for it
[5305.77s -> 5307.69s]  This is not like you need to know what this is
[5307.69s -> 5310.17s]  And i've already started talking with people and trying to get the ball rolling on it
[5310.17s -> 5312.25s]  So it's gonna if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen soon
[5314.27s -> 5316.27s]  This like if this just pops up one day
[5316.99s -> 5319.71s]  No one's gonna know what to do. It's gonna be fucking confusing
[5320.27s -> 5332.91s]  It's gonna be really confusing if this stream just turns on it's gonna be like I don't even know what the fuck's happening
[5333.23s -> 5339.48s]  Remember how we talked about the detective stream before it happened for like a week or so a couple weeks
[5339.48s -> 5341.48s]  And I mean this is not gonna happen in like a week or two
[5341.48s -> 5346.88s]  But like i've already started the process of trying to figure out how this is actually gonna work. Here you go
[5346.88s -> 5347.92s]  You ready?
[5347.92s -> 5352.08s]  An upcoming stream that i'm trying to and i've been i've been trying to do this for a long time because it's just hard to do
[5356.41s -> 5357.85s]  It's not like a big deal
[5357.85s -> 5361.93s]  It's just something fun that i've wanted to do and it's gonna happen probably if it's going to happen
[5361.93s -> 5365.58s]  It's gonna happen soon. Here it is
[5365.66s -> 5367.66s]  i'm going to set up a stream
[5371.90s -> 5373.00s]  where
[5373.00s -> 5375.79s]  I sit in a dunk tank
[5375.79s -> 5378.75s]  And twitch controls a robot pitching machine
[5379.31s -> 5382.06s]  To try to dunk me while I talk shit
[5393.96s -> 5396.20s]  I think I may have talked about it once before
[5397.92s -> 5404.49s]  At the very end of a stream
[5404.49s -> 5408.41s]  But I never not like in the middle of a stream. I think I talked about it maybe once a little bit
[5410.04s -> 5414.36s]  I've been and that was probably a while ago and i've been trying to figure out how to do this and i've got somebody now
[5415.31s -> 5421.12s]  That has knowledge in this area that can help so
[5422.80s -> 5435.53s]  That idea is actually probably going to happen. How does that relate to detective? Well, it relates like this
[5437.56s -> 5442.36s]  There's going to be like chat bots and stuff that are in the stream a day or two before people are going to be like
[5442.36s -> 5443.96s]  What the fuck is this?
[5443.96s -> 5446.12s]  So you kind of need to know that that's a possibility
[5449.82s -> 5452.54s]  Is chat going to aim it by saying left right? Yes
[5453.50s -> 5455.34s]  It's going to be total chaos
[5455.34s -> 5464.48s]  And you gotta dunk me
[5468.94s -> 5473.42s]  And then and I know people saying well, hold on a second. What if we just aim it like backwards?
[5473.90s -> 5475.90s]  No, there's going to be like safety
[5476.30s -> 5480.88s]  There's going to be a safety person there that's job is to make sure that you guys don't like
[5481.44s -> 5483.44s]  aim it all the way to the left and like
[5484.24s -> 5491.93s]  Blow out a window. There'll be a safety individual there whose job is to make sure that it's safe
[5504.14s -> 5506.14s]  Do you guys know how it don't tank works
[5506.99s -> 5518.75s]  There's a cage and like a little button fill the tank with maple syrup. No
[5519.31s -> 5523.40s]  I'm filling up with hot sauce
[5523.40s -> 5535.45s]  That's not happening either
[5535.45s -> 5538.49s]  But there was a major development on that very recently
[5540.19s -> 5544.27s]  So there is a very high possibility that you're just gonna see that it's just gonna happen
[5544.99s -> 5549.15s]  You'll see the fucking okay when you start to see like the chat bot come into the channel
[5551.71s -> 5554.91s]  And I we might do some testing too on it to make sure it works
[5555.71s -> 5571.82s]  That's how you know, it's coming
[5571.82s -> 5576.17s]  Fill it with ecto cooler
[5576.25s -> 5578.59s]  Uh, not this this guy's a pushover
[5581.04s -> 5583.12s]  Is it's gonna be a pitching machine the chat moves? Yes
[5586.48s -> 5588.48s]  the original idea was
[5588.94s -> 5591.58s]  To have it be
[5591.58s -> 5595.34s]  a stream that you kind of got like it lined up for and
[5596.91s -> 5599.52s]  Okay, that was insane
[5599.52s -> 5601.52s]  Like it was somebody's turn, right?
[5604.44s -> 5609.88s]  But it logistically it would be very difficult to set that up and maybe it depends on if I can get some
[5610.44s -> 5612.68s]  The people that I have involved if they can give me guidance on it
[5616.56s -> 5621.44s]  So, you know essentially maybe you like you pay like five dollars in bits or something you get three balls
[5621.76s -> 5624.56s]  That was like the original idea that this would all be for charity, by the way
[5625.50s -> 5628.86s]  Um, but then I thought about that would be very very difficult to do
[5630.49s -> 5632.73s]  because
[5632.73s -> 5635.29s]  It would just there could be a ton
[5636.25s -> 5638.89s]  Of people in that line and it went we might never end
[5645.82s -> 5651.10s]  There was ideas maybe to have like certain people maybe get a you know white listed to do it
[5651.50s -> 5654.46s]  Like another streamer is something to get a chance or make it an event
[5656.40s -> 5660.80s]  But i'm not sure yet, but I don't think that I don't I don't want people to pay to do it though
[5668.01s -> 5671.37s]  Bidding war for five minutes highest bid after five minutes gets the ball
[5676.03s -> 5680.51s]  Yeah, or like random draw is another thing maybe like random draw give somebody a chance to do it
[5680.51s -> 5682.51s]  But the thing with random draw is
[5683.44s -> 5685.44s]  If what if that person's like afk
[5686.44s -> 5690.36s]  It'd be like, oh, all right. Well, we need to have a code set up where if they didn't move
[5691.68s -> 5694.16s]  For x amount of seconds, they would just go on to another person
[5709.04s -> 5712.88s]  Have a quiz at the first but yeah, I think these are all interesting things to try
[5715.10s -> 5717.98s]  But I didn't want to kind of just start opening up a conversation about it
[5718.54s -> 5721.34s]  Because it's something that I really really want to do soon
[5722.22s -> 5725.90s]  Because it's I once the weather started to get better
[5726.70s -> 5730.78s]  It was going to be these things I want to try to do and this is one of them the asmr stream is another one
[5732.22s -> 5734.48s]  That's still happening
[5734.48s -> 5738.16s]  I can't let that one go because of a couple of very specific things. I want to do in it
[5738.56s -> 5763.05s]  Well 260 accuracy, yeah, I would break twitch. I don't know
[5764.92s -> 5766.68s]  If it was done, right?
[5766.68s -> 5769.16s]  I mean when like twitch plays pokemon was a thing there was
[5769.88s -> 5771.88s]  Tens of thousands of people there
[5772.41s -> 5791.72s]  Just needs to be done, right?
[5791.72s -> 5794.52s]  Isn't asmr banned from twitch? Uh, I
[5795.32s -> 5797.72s]  That would be very new development if that was the case
[5798.28s -> 5806.48s]  They're people that based their entire channels on that, right?
[5813.42s -> 5815.42s]  prga2c
[5816.40s -> 5831.20s]  Okay
[5831.20s -> 5832.65s]  uh
[5832.65s -> 5835.13s]  What the fuck is this? It's an actual robot thing
[5837.31s -> 5839.31s]  This is like a true bot
[5839.31s -> 5843.34s]  a terrible defense apparently
[5847.76s -> 5853.39s]  That thing's cool
[5853.39s -> 5855.71s]  Breeding robots. Yeah, don't you just build a robot?
[5864.09s -> 5868.65s]  yeah, the reason why the the dunk tank thing is something that was going to take a while was just because
[5870.70s -> 5872.40s]  programming and
[5872.40s -> 5876.72s]  Robotics and stuff that takes people to know what the fuck they're doing with that certain
[5877.52s -> 5878.64s]  field
[5878.64s -> 5882.20s]  And i've been throwing the line out a bunch of times actually
[5883.15s -> 5888.03s]  over the course of the last like five months to see if I could find somebody that was like really knowledgeable in like the
[5888.11s -> 5890.78s]  chatbot area and
[5890.78s -> 5895.02s]  Very the reason only reason why i'm talking about it is because there was a very very recent development
[5895.84s -> 5908.16s]  On getting it actually started. Let's back it up and just end this. Let's let's make this like flashy

[7085.06s -> 7090.38s]  And just signs it and gives it to him and the kid
[7091.02s -> 7096.96s]  Puts like a million dollars on the check and cashes it and gets the money
[7101.81s -> 7104.77s]  In a sense, apparently the banking system would just allow that
[7109.81s -> 7113.09s]  That's already I mean, I know it's i'm like i'm describing the movie
[7113.09s -> 7118.34s]  This is blank check is the name of the movie and he buys a bunch of fucked up shit

[7475.87s -> 7480.51s]  No, I don't have a dream car I I just want a car that works and is easy to drive
[7495.17s -> 7497.33s]  No, I don't I don't drive manuals. No
[7501.02s -> 7503.18s]  I'm the type of person that gets behind the wheel of a manual
[7504.26s -> 7510.10s]  And would this would exactly what would happen? It would be fine. Everything would be going perfectly. Normally I would be good
[7510.10s -> 7513.22s]  Everything would be fine. Pull up to that red light slow it down a little
[7518.11s -> 7519.31s]  Okay
[7519.31s -> 7523.63s]  Now let's start up. I've done this like a hundred times. Let's keep going get it out of neutral clutch up
[7524.19s -> 7526.19s]  Put in first gear
[7526.19s -> 7528.91s]  Get into second gear and then accidentally put it in fourth gear
[7532.46s -> 7546.32s]  To that'll be 2,500 dollars, please i'm so stupid with that kind of shit man. I would fuck it up at some point I would
[7559.86s -> 7561.86s]  Nobody wants to hear your life story
[7570.85s -> 7574.05s]  I don't know why i'm thinking about this going to like a convenience store
[7576.56s -> 7580.18s]  Like oh, yeah, I want to pay uh put up like a fucking
[7580.82s -> 7587.78s]  Tootsie roll with a monster energy drink i'm gonna be paying in cash and you think it's like scary
[7598.67s -> 7600.67s]  What am I gonna feed him have a banana
[7611.07s -> 7613.79s]  Why why are you paying for this energy drink in cash?
[7614.43s -> 7616.99s]  What the fuck is this? Huh? Why would you get this buddy?
[7628.13s -> 7632.05s]  That's so fucking funny. It's not really but it just like is
[7632.77s -> 7644.32s]  All right, let's go to the
[7644.32s -> 7646.48s]  This dude's got like 20 in cash on him
[7647.87s -> 7649.87s]  Would that come from where'd you get that?
[7667.90s -> 7669.90s]  How did you get that much?
[7671.70s -> 7673.06s]  All right, let's get
[7673.06s -> 7676.82s]  Spyroid out of this like fucking wood rank already
[7677.46s -> 7681.74s]  Before I say other things that make no fucking sense
[7687.04s -> 7689.20s]  What are we gonna get rid of like the penny?
[7689.84s -> 7708.05s]  That's another one. Aren't we the only country on earth that still has like a one cent denomination in physical currency?
[7722.67s -> 7733.07s]  No, you know canada's the only country that got rid of it. Is that true?
[7738.70s -> 7741.18s]  Why are you still alive? Don't ruin this for me
[7742.40s -> 7744.48s]  Oh my god, I hate this game
[7745.68s -> 7750.24s]  He's gonna win. He's gonna win right here because of this don't do it again
[7750.72s -> 7775.62s]  I let you know, you know, I really would love somebody said i'd love like a 20 dollar coin
[7776.26s -> 7779.94s]  That'd be what kind of cool wouldn't it be to have like a hundred dollar coin?
[7780.66s -> 7794.45s]  You'd lose it. Well, you could lose a hundred dollar bill too and they still make those
[7804.35s -> 7805.95s]  It's heavier too
[7805.95s -> 7812.62s]  And plus if hey if that that hundred dollar bill gets stuck in your in your pockets or something and it gets in the laundry
[7813.26s -> 7816.06s]  That shit's all fucked up and it could be ripped up and destroyed
[7817.02s -> 7820.34s]  That coin is going to be fine
[7820.34s -> 7822.34s]  And yeah, why does it have to be?
[7822.66s -> 7824.66s]  You got why are you guys talking about like a quarter?
[7825.90s -> 7830.78s]  Why wouldn't if it was a hundred dollar coin, it would be the size of like a small like teacup
[7831.42s -> 7835.74s]  It would be like a rock
[7835.74s -> 7843.07s]  It'd be like a tea saucer. It would weigh like four pounds to make sure you couldn't lose it
[7848.94s -> 7859.55s]  a twenty dollar rock
[7859.55s -> 7863.95s]  Why not just have a hundred dollar rock? Yeah, that's what i'm saying. Like have a half a rock that's priced at a hundred dollars
[7865.30s -> 7869.22s]  Well, like i'll look at nostalgia like this is what they used to trade when they were cavemen
[7869.30s -> 7871.30s]  So like there's a nostalgia factor there
[7871.78s -> 7886.80s]  I didn't block that come on. So a diamond a diamond is a okay a four pound diamond
[7887.52s -> 7889.84s]  that was as big as a teacup would be like
[7890.78s -> 7892.78s]  a hundred and fifty million dollars
[7893.20s -> 7895.20s]  That's not a twenty dollar what?
[7900.56s -> 7907.60s]  Four pounds of gold would be very expensive too. No, just there's no material like cubric zirconium or something that could be like
[7908.16s -> 7914.56s]  100 bucks
[7914.56s -> 7917.52s]  and you just bring that to the grocery store and they pay for your
[7918.56s -> 7938.02s]  Pay for your sunny delight
[7939.06s -> 7941.30s]  Just replace
[7942.40s -> 7946.16s]  Replace the dollar with a full can of arizona iced tea
[7949.49s -> 7953.42s]  That's fucking awesome
[7953.42s -> 7957.92s]  Yeah, we got rid of the dollar. It's now the one dollar denomination is a can of arizona
[7960.58s -> 7966.26s]  What a pain in the ass imagine getting back like six dollar bills you get six cans of arizona iced tea
[7968.64s -> 7970.64s]  What a miserable experience
[7982.66s -> 7984.66s]  How the fuck are they able to still do that?
[7987.15s -> 7991.55s]  But it can't like think about that, but we've had this conversation. I'm having like deja vu
[7992.27s -> 7994.27s]  Why is arizona iced tea a dollar?
[7997.66s -> 8006.70s]  That's just like it's like a gallon of iced tea in there. Is it just water and then like syrup?
[8013.68s -> 8019.36s]  How come arizona iced tea is 99 cents and like the one next to it on the shelf is a dollar 80
[8019.76s -> 8022.51s]  for less iced tea
[8027.30s -> 8029.30s]  The strip club
[8029.54s -> 8034.82s]  It would be a bunch of fucking weirdos like like drinking their iced teas and like putting them on the table
[8043.87s -> 8049.73s]  You just look around the guys like counting their strip club money they got like fucking 40 arizonas in a backpack
[8051.46s -> 8058.38s]  That would be a mess
[8058.38s -> 8062.54s]  People would be accidentally dropping them and like they would be exploding and fizz would be going everywhere
[8065.74s -> 8068.94s]  A casino was just like you had to just open it and pour it in the machine
[8069.34s -> 8076.96s]  Those things are so heavy too
[8079.89s -> 8085.49s]  Going through the the turn the kiosk for like the toll
[8086.45s -> 8090.29s]  You just like whip out the window like fucking four arizona iced teas
[8093.04s -> 8106.74s]  out of the car
[8106.74s -> 8108.74s]  Oh, that's so fucking funny
[8111.10s -> 8115.82s]  Shit like that is just like yeah, I I love that shit
[8117.71s -> 8123.78s]  fucking absurd
[8123.78s -> 8129.06s]  Wishing wells. Yeah, there's just floating hundreds of floating arizona cans
[8138.85s -> 8140.85s]  arizona
[8141.41s -> 8143.33s]  Okay, I gotta take a break
[8143.33s -> 8147.97s]  Atm arizona tea machine. I gotta pee. I'm gonna grab an arizona iced tea. I'll be right back
[8390.96s -> 8414.48s]  Shall we? Oh, hey, yeah, I get grabbing tea beer back. But yeah, honestly, I don't I don't know how the arizona iced tea just must
[8416.72s -> 8422.11s]  I don't know how maybe they sell a lot which arizona did I get the watermelon one?
[8423.63s -> 8425.63s]  Green tea and honey. Oh
[8429.25s -> 8439.57s]  They have so many flavors too. How do you have that many flavors? You don't actually know what it is
[8439.57s -> 8443.02s]  Hey, this is for real. You know what? I've been doing lately. I've been
[8444.72s -> 8446.90s]  Like soda. No get out of here
[8447.06s -> 8453.10s]  Juice. No, no, no, no, no juice. Get it out of here. You want to like a little secret cut down on your sugar intake
[8453.82s -> 8458.11s]  Check it out. Ready? Listen to me. Take a glass of water
[8458.51s -> 8461.90s]  Right filtered water probably if you have it
[8462.14s -> 8467.74s]  So just water and put a little bit of ice in it take a buy lemon
[8467.82s -> 8478.74s]  Just get like a bag of lemons. It's like three or four dollars take one out roll it on the counter cut that shit in half
[8479.22s -> 8482.59s]  Get a little lemon squeezer a little like a little juicer
[8482.59s -> 8484.99s]  You know things like with the upside down cone and you go
[8486.50s -> 8499.94s]  The juice of a half lemon put that into the ice water, you know straight out if you want to and then add to that
[8500.42s -> 8503.54s]  Just one teaspoon of sugar
[8504.80s -> 8506.80s]  One teaspoon no more
[8507.65s -> 8517.39s]  Spin it around with a straw. Enjoy it one teaspoon and make your own easy
[8517.47s -> 8523.34s]  It's like it tastes much better than the lemonade you can buy at the store. Even the ones that are organic
[8523.66s -> 8525.66s]  They still load those things with shit
[8532.80s -> 8535.76s]  That's like that and if you don't want the sugar you don't have to add it
[8536.16s -> 8539.82s]  But I like having a little bit of sweetness to my lemonade
[8541.28s -> 8545.36s]  It is just lemonade. I know that what do you think this is a rocket scientific thing that i'm describing
[8551.60s -> 8553.92s]  Just squeeze half a lemon of juice
[8555.09s -> 8559.97s]  Into a glass of water with a little teaspoon of sugar stir it up. That's a healthy alternative
[8561.15s -> 8562.83s]  to like
[8562.83s -> 8569.98s]  Monster or even like a orange juice. It's light. It's refreshing. It gets the bowels moving
[8581.58s -> 8585.10s]  I'm serious now. That's a good thing
[8585.18s -> 8588.62s]  Everything is a healthy replacement to monster. You know, that's probably true
[8588.70s -> 8593.18s]  I you know, probably smoking cigarettes is probably a healthy alternative to drinking monster
[8600.64s -> 8604.75s]  All right, who's got a tournament you are in d now, right? Good. Let me see the schedule
[8605.31s -> 8613.17s]  All right, so you are here now. We can do one two three and bring you up
[8618.91s -> 8620.51s]  Three of these in a row
[8620.51s -> 8625.60s]  And then the official tournament is here
[8626.72s -> 8628.72s]  I can't sign up for it yet. All right, what about you?
[8629.68s -> 8632.08s]  Roberto has one more tournament
[8633.04s -> 8634.56s]  in s
[8634.56s -> 8639.52s]  Already signed up for it and then the official cup is here. Hopefully we can no it's not it's a group battle
[8640.53s -> 8642.29s]  Don't die before this
[8642.29s -> 8644.85s]  Fuck I have to go find the stupid explorers
[8649.55s -> 8653.63s]  Blood is a healthy drink. I've been feeling a lot better since I started replacing soda with blood
[8656.42s -> 8659.54s]  Is that some kind of new like energy drink or something?
[8660.18s -> 8665.28s]  That's got to be some
[8665.36s -> 8672.05s]  Really interesting marketing campaign, right? I'm surprised no one's done that yet if that's not true
[8672.69s -> 8679.52s]  Have it be like thick and red and like have a weird sugary flavor to it with a bunch of like b vitamins
[8680.48s -> 8692.14s]  Monster blood. Why have they not done that? Okay, that's fine. You should rest here
[8693.31s -> 8697.09s]  rest and then
[8697.25s -> 8702.64s]  I gotta look at stats here
[8702.64s -> 8704.34s]  212
[8704.34s -> 8707.86s]  Terrible life. I gotta work on life right now life and speed
[8709.39s -> 8715.47s]  That just they're just awful or life and defense i'm gonna get speed at least that's abysmal
[8716.03s -> 8725.22s]  There's speed here
[8725.22s -> 8726.98s]  Get on that trampoline
[8726.98s -> 8729.90s]  Then you can rest
[8729.90s -> 8731.90s]  You doing why then you can chill
[8732.54s -> 8734.54s]  You can rest
[8734.70s -> 8737.14s]  You can do sandbag you can
[8737.62s -> 8739.57s]  do
[8739.57s -> 8751.04s]  uh accuracy
[8751.04s -> 8757.60s]  Well, that was a huge gain for improver. I miss being back sonic. I think we all do
[8758.40s -> 8759.36s]  but
[8759.74s -> 8761.74s]  His legacy lives on
[8761.90s -> 8778.06s]  I think you deserve the salmon. Yeah, you do. We gotta get you up
[8784.54s -> 8793.28s]  Frustrated why you don't like fish? Oh, no that wrong person is Roberto alive. Yeah, Roberto still alive tired though
[8793.92s -> 8802.50s]  What a character but that's Roberto salmon
[8804.19s -> 8806.19s]  He used them before he expires
[8806.51s -> 8807.92s]  I will
[8807.92s -> 8809.92s]  I'm saving before every week in case he dies
[8810.64s -> 8813.04s]  Then i'm just gonna reload and then put him on ice
[8813.76s -> 8815.76s]  Get the dragon up. Are they friends?
[8820.32s -> 8822.32s]  What how I gotta get them to be good friends
[8826.59s -> 8835.46s]  That's breeder info. I mean they're good friends, but I want to be great friends
[8835.94s -> 8842.59s]  I gotta take them on an adventure
[8842.59s -> 8844.62s]  All right
[8844.62s -> 8846.93s]  You're who cares?
[8847.87s -> 8851.42s]  wisdom
[8851.42s -> 8855.84s]  Where the hell's the doll there is?
[8855.92s -> 8862.29s]  Very lively today
[8862.29s -> 8866.64s]  Okay, let's see
[8866.64s -> 8867.68s]  dead

[8875.89s -> 8878.61s]  Uh more tournaments here in a row
[8879.57s -> 8883.06s]  Rest and then let's get you on speed
[8884.35s -> 8886.35s]  Two speed that's two speeds in a row
[8887.78s -> 8889.78s]  And then let's get you on
[8892.37s -> 8893.33s]  health
[8893.33s -> 8896.29s]  You need it bad. You just it's like a guy this big
[8900.29s -> 8902.29s]  Rest trampoline life blade life blade
[8902.93s -> 8905.01s]  Maybe even rest here. Yeah, just rest here
[8907.38s -> 8909.38s]  And you are gonna rest
[8909.62s -> 8911.62s]  sandbag rest
[8912.34s -> 8914.34s]  Book book rest good
[8914.90s -> 8916.90s]  Rest rest rest
[8916.98s -> 8920.58s]  i'm tired
[8920.58s -> 8922.94s]  Now i'll put you under
[8923.02s -> 8928.21s]  Target, okay
[8930.86s -> 8939.42s]  Bad
[8939.42s -> 8955.81s]  Arizona iced tea. Okay, you're doing good. You are okay
[8956.61s -> 8958.78s]  Let's praise you
[8958.78s -> 8961.58s]  You got a big tourney coming up before you die
[8968.05s -> 8978.98s]  That's so sad, but it's true. All right spiroid clean it up
[8989.58s -> 8991.74s]  My toilet water tastes like I can't drink sweet tea
[8995.01s -> 9006.26s]  Sweet tea hurts
[9006.26s -> 9010.02s]  If I drink sweet tea, I feel bad. My body hurts
[9017.39s -> 9019.47s]  I'm wearing the pumpkin goggles
[9020.19s -> 9031.74s]  pumpkin vr
[9031.74s -> 9037.84s]  But you you see sometimes I understand I like having things sweet. I like sugary stuff, right?
[9038.40s -> 9040.40s]  I like drinking soda. Sometimes I like
[9041.20s -> 9046.06s]  Uh, I like sweetened things. I like sugary things cakes ice cream, right?
[9046.94s -> 9051.18s]  But you really get to know somebody you get to see who they are who they truly are
[9051.98s -> 9054.62s]  when they order a tea from a restaurant
[9055.50s -> 9058.06s]  And watch how much sugar they put into their iced tea
[9058.86s -> 9071.63s]  You really they can tell you anything they want about themselves. You'll know exactly who they are. I see some people
[9073.28s -> 9076.40s]  For like an unsweetened tea that they get from ice from the restaurant
[9077.20s -> 9079.12s]  They put in
[9079.12s -> 9081.12s]  like 10 sugar packets
[9081.44s -> 9087.14s]  What's going on there? Why what's what's going on there? Why you what's going on? Why are you doing that?
[9091.60s -> 9102.59s]  too much
[9102.59s -> 9104.59s]  10 that's rookie numbers
[9104.75s -> 9112.86s]  They're okay. Uh, like the coffee is another uh situation here, right?
[9114.91s -> 9116.91s]  there were the order like I
[9116.91s -> 9121.90s]  And if you're one of these people then it's uh, that's it's all right to be one of these people
[9122.46s -> 9124.42s]  but just be careful
[9124.42s -> 9126.98s]  i'm not telling you how to drink coffee, but
[9127.46s -> 9129.22s]  a double double
[9129.22s -> 9131.22s]  double cream double sugar
[9132.42s -> 9133.62s]  Be careful
[9133.62s -> 9142.00s]  You end up it's like you're drinking
[9142.48s -> 9144.48s]  Ice cream. It's milk and sugar
[9145.47s -> 9151.15s]  double double double cream double sugar in a regular coffee
[9153.17s -> 9156.13s]  And when I say regular i'm talking if you go to like dunkin donuts
[9156.53s -> 9162.69s]  They're regular already like a regular iced coffee from dunkin. I believe has four or five teaspoons. I think tablespoons of sugar
[9166.11s -> 9169.07s]  easy
[9169.07s -> 9171.39s]  You work with someone who drinks four times four
[9176.64s -> 9178.48s]  Just be careful
[9178.48s -> 9188.29s]  That's so much
[9188.29s -> 9190.29s]  That's an insane amount of sugar
[9195.10s -> 9196.24s]  unprover
[9196.24s -> 9204.14s]  Well, I don't care if you drink coffee black or if you drink coffee with double double
[9204.78s -> 9210.50s]  But if you're gonna order like a ultra quad
[9211.14s -> 9214.58s]  Just order an ice cream
[9214.58s -> 9215.94s]  It's probably better
[9215.94s -> 9222.02s]  Do you tell people that when you have coffee with them be careful
[9227.30s -> 9231.14s]  Yeah, i'll take a a quad quad 15 sugar, uh
[9231.78s -> 9233.14s]  half cream

[10430.94s -> 10433.80s]  I'm running out of food
[10433.80s -> 10440.99s]  Here have a banana
[10440.99s -> 10442.99s]  Never had a lemon lemon's probably my favorite fruit
[10456.54s -> 10458.54s]  I just like lemon juice
[10458.54s -> 10460.88s]  I like lemon zest
[10460.88s -> 10463.28s]  Lemon can is is an incredibly versatile thing
[10466.73s -> 10470.25s]  Mario and zelda are gonna work with labo vr. Oh, that's gonna be fun
[10477.07s -> 10481.15s]  Need a lemon on stream. No lemons the best fruit that you don't eat
[10483.39s -> 10488.45s]  It's used in so many things, but you don't actually eat lemons
[10489.33s -> 10491.01s]  It's kind of weird how that works
[10491.01s -> 10503.97s]  What do you mean you do?
[10503.97s -> 10508.13s]  You guys like cut a lemon in half and like eat the fruit out like a grapefruit or like an orange
[10510.54s -> 10518.45s]  I don't believe anybody that's saying that none of you. I just really don't believe that at all
[10526.24s -> 10530.03s]  You're gonna fuck up like your stomach acid. Yep. Be careful
[10530.67s -> 10545.18s]  All right, we got a single battle with spyroid. Just can you do it this time and actually win?
[10545.98s -> 10556.77s]  That's like saying eating a pickle fucks you up. What?
[10559.12s -> 10563.12s]  Lemon lemon juice straight is insanely acidic
[10565.58s -> 10582.80s]  Pickles are pickled. I don't believe it. What's my opinion on limes?
[10583.36s -> 10586.35s]  Yeah, they're like the jokey side character next to a lemon
[10586.91s -> 10618.74s]  Lemon's the main character plus lime also kind of tastes like throw up. So this guy this character sucks
[10624.85s -> 10631.97s]  What's wrong with this guy
[10631.97s -> 10641.71s]  He can't land anything and his moves don't hurt. I just gotta keep him away from tournaments
[10644.59s -> 10651.84s]  No, I actually I love lemons and I love limes not I don't like limes as much limes are good on food
[10652.32s -> 10656.08s]  More than lemons for me like a squeeze of lime
[10657.47s -> 10662.51s]  Adds a lot more. I lost four fans. Well, that's what happens. You lose two tournaments in a row
[10663.71s -> 10668.35s]  And there's the backtrack. No, I said, okay, but fine. I'm not gonna backtrack it. I don't like limes
[10669.31s -> 10672.99s]  They're only good when you squeeze it on like a piece of meat or something
[10684.58s -> 10689.70s]  That's 90 of their use. Yeah, but i'm talking about i'm talking pure just flavor eating a lime versus eating
[10689.78s -> 10697.22s]  lemon, but I would rather you fill a
[10699.25s -> 10702.24s]  like a tub of
[10702.24s -> 10705.44s]  No, I don't think I would no, I can't I wouldn't do that either way. So
[10706.08s -> 10713.44s]  I never had limeade. Yeah, I have it just it tastes it's too sour for me
[10714.26s -> 10716.26s]  limeade versus lemonade limeade has that weird
[10717.30s -> 10718.34s]  super
[10718.34s -> 10720.34s]  Like puckery aftertaste
[10720.58s -> 10727.52s]  Lemonade does not
[10727.52s -> 10730.40s]  All right, please just do life in defense. Just don't do anything else
[10734.08s -> 10736.08s]  Just life over and over again
[10742.10s -> 10744.10s]  Strawberry lemon, I love strawberry lemonade
[10745.36s -> 10747.73s]  It's really good
[10747.73s -> 10750.21s]  Cherry limeade i've never had that before that sounds pretty good
[10751.94s -> 10753.78s]  Maybe one day i'll find it
[10753.78s -> 10760.88s]  All right, you need to rest you're frustrated
[10761.76s -> 10762.88s]  rest
[10762.88s -> 10764.16s]  rest
[10764.16s -> 10766.64s]  target saying ah rest you're all like
[10767.86s -> 10770.10s]  You're all fucked up
[10770.10s -> 10771.78s]  Cherry limeade is good
[10771.78s -> 10787.58s]  I'll have to try it. I've never had cherry limeade. Do I live under a rock?
[10791.70s -> 10794.10s]  I don't think i've ever had cherry limeade before
[10795.39s -> 10797.23s]  If I have I didn't really
[10797.23s -> 10799.23s]  I didn't go holy shit and remember it
[10801.74s -> 10803.98s]  Favorite flavor of red bull none of them I drank one
[10804.30s -> 10808.62s]  I drank like two of them three weeks ago and had the worst migraine i've ever had in probably the last five years
[10809.18s -> 10813.31s]  So I I stopped
[10813.31s -> 10828.72s]  Is there in none of the above?
[10828.72s -> 10830.08s]  Just drink one
[10830.08s -> 10832.64s]  Yeah, I didn't drink like three
[10834.43s -> 10837.79s]  I had one and then I had one the next day
[10839.87s -> 10848.03s]  I didn't just slam them
[10848.03s -> 10849.79s]  Be careful
[10849.79s -> 10852.69s]  Be careful
[10852.69s -> 10855.41s]  Okay, you're lively you're fine. You don't need to eat anything you could
[10857.44s -> 10859.44s]  Everyone's doing just fine
[10859.89s -> 10863.46s]  You're fine
[10863.46s -> 10870.38s]  You're fine. Everyone's good to go. Keep going
[10870.94s -> 10881.39s]  There's a way to make lemonade sweet without sugar just add it. That's not that's disgusting
[10884.85s -> 10888.05s]  I love mayonnaise, but I think it only belongs in certain things for me
[10888.77s -> 10893.82s]  Did you wait? Did you say he loves mayonnaise?
[10895.58s -> 10899.15s]  Right
[10899.15s -> 10901.15s]  He puts mayo on like a turkey sandwich
[10901.87s -> 10914.26s]  Yeah, it's fantastic actually and don't even throw this nonsense at me for miracle whip that stuff
[10914.90s -> 10916.32s]  is
[10916.32s -> 10919.00s]  Unedible it's unedible
[10919.58s -> 10929.79s]  It tastes like poison miracle whip tastes to me like what poison tastes like if I've ever had it
[10934.24s -> 10939.04s]  And this is in my personal opinion. I'm not i'm just saying I don't really like okay. I gotta be careful here
[10939.04s -> 10953.10s]  Just be careful
[10953.10s -> 10956.30s]  No to be completely fair though miracle whip actually is pretty good
[10957.12s -> 10962.48s]  In certain recipes where it replaces mayonnaise and it tastes better but on a sandwich though
[10963.20s -> 10968.93s]  That's a yuck
[10968.93s -> 10972.16s]  He's wrong
[10972.16s -> 10974.40s]  That's not a backtrack. I just still I just said yuck
[10980.88s -> 10984.08s]  He's spineless. No, I just said it was I think it's yucky
[10989.76s -> 10992.88s]  Guy don't ever have an opinion on the internet. Someone will throw a drink in your face
[10993.52s -> 11000.93s]  Sorry, the only way i'm allowed to have an opinion on miracle whip
[11001.49s -> 11006.27s]  Is if I go to like a mayonnaise reddit and we like talk about how bad it is
[11025.23s -> 11033.84s]  Is there no, that can't be what am I saying? There probably has to be all right. I like everyone's
[11034.56s -> 11036.38s]  schedules here
[11036.38s -> 11038.38s]  sandbag book tub
[11039.34s -> 11047.68s]  target lightweight
[11047.68s -> 11052.24s]  I'm honestly surprised that there's an active batman arkham reddit than a mayonnaise one
[11058.62s -> 11064.16s]  What japanese mayo is that japanese mayo is fucking amazing
[11065.76s -> 11067.76s]  it is
[11067.76s -> 11069.22s]  Unbelievable
[11069.22s -> 11071.22s]  If you've never had japanese mayo before
[11071.94s -> 11093.23s]  You gotta get it
[11093.23s -> 11094.91s]  Isn't mayonnaise just
[11094.91s -> 11096.91s]  whipped oil and eggs
[11098.98s -> 11116.16s]  Don't tell anybody that
[11116.16s -> 11120.96s]  I said you just I don't know where you got that secret recipe from but what the fuck man
[11121.52s -> 11126.75s]  I'm gonna have to delete this pod
[11126.75s -> 11129.87s]  Fuck, I I can't believe somebody actually just said that
[11138.46s -> 11140.86s]  Aioli is next level. Yeah, like a garlic aioli
[11142.58s -> 11144.58s]  You guys are gonna make me want a sandwich
[11158.00s -> 11162.64s]  Oh, you know, I don't know why but for right now, I don't know what it was
[11163.28s -> 11168.90s]  I somebody said the word like garlic and then mayonnaise and then sauerkraut came in my mind
[11169.30s -> 11171.94s]  And then like swiss cheese popped up and then pastrami showed up
[11173.52s -> 11178.24s]  And then thousand island dressing just showed up too with toasted rye bread and now I want that
[11179.82s -> 11182.38s]  I want I want a pastrami sandwich right now
[11182.94s -> 11184.56s]  I want a ruben
[11184.56s -> 11187.44s]  Or it could be just pastrami doesn't matter with mustard. Maybe
[11189.31s -> 11194.22s]  hmm
[11195.44s -> 11202.82s]  Damn swiss cheese is bad. Come on. That's not true
[11203.38s -> 11214.37s]  Thousand island is shit
[11214.37s -> 11219.01s]  Guys food is more subjective than like art or comedy. You know that right?
[11219.57s -> 11229.47s]  Think about how many stand-up comics you've seen that you were like, oh those jokes weren't funny multiply that by 500 million types of food
[11230.03s -> 11250.83s]  All right, everyone's good. I think it's the tournament right now, right? There are so many kinds of food
[11251.47s -> 11255.95s]  Group battle. This is not
[11256.27s -> 11259.07s]  I don't have anybody up here. I need to do the stupid find the
[11259.95s -> 11261.87s]  guy in the forest
[11261.87s -> 11266.70s]  Yeah, the amount of food combinations you can make
[11268.51s -> 11269.71s]  There's
[11269.71s -> 11271.71s]  So many of them
[11277.25s -> 11279.41s]  There's as many types of foods as there are houses
[11280.21s -> 11281.57s]  at least
[11281.57s -> 11283.57s]  Do you like uh gyros? I do
[11285.14s -> 11287.14s]  I do love gyros. They're amazing
[11287.78s -> 11291.74s]  chicken gyro
[11291.74s -> 11295.66s]  No competitions just train and send people to the dungeon whatever the hell it is
[11298.69s -> 11301.17s]  I look I like we talked about this already
[11302.11s -> 11303.07s]  I've
[11303.07s -> 11305.63s]  There's a bunch of i've had a ton of delicious
[11306.59s -> 11307.71s]  gyros
[11307.71s -> 11308.83s]  gyros
[11308.83s -> 11311.79s]  Gyros every time I order one I get corrected on the phone
[11312.74s -> 11320.27s]  I've ordered a gyro from probably 15 different establishments and I say it I say
[11320.99s -> 11322.99s]  Yeah, can I get a chicken gyro, please?
[11323.15s -> 11328.56s]  Uh chicken gyro. Yeah. Yeah, that's the one I then call another place
[11329.34s -> 11331.34s]  Hey, can I get a chicken gyro, please?
[11331.42s -> 11332.46s]  a chicken
[11332.46s -> 11333.50s]  Gyro
[11333.50s -> 11337.36s]  Yeah. Yeah, that's the one. Yes, of course. What's happening every time so it doesn't
[11338.16s -> 11347.63s]  What am I supposed to do
[11347.63s -> 11350.83s]  From my understanding it's like euro, right like euro
[11351.47s -> 11356.74s]  Like gyro are they just fucking with me on the phone?
[11359.33s -> 11363.65s]  So I am saying it correctly, but but how come I get corrected on the phone?
[11370.27s -> 11373.79s]  Like I like hey, I'll take one. I'll take one chicken gyro, please
[11374.03s -> 11380.08s]  Okay, one chicken gyro like almost like they're underhandedly correcting me and I'm like, yeah
[11380.72s -> 11390.61s]  All right. What we got for you. Let's do more life blade life blade life blade
[11396.03s -> 11398.03s]  You are going to do power
[11398.35s -> 11402.30s]  I forget about adrock
[11415.22s -> 11419.70s]  I don't care about this guy at all. I I don't want to even put him on the ranch anymore
[11421.71s -> 11424.11s]  But i'm gonna level him up a little so he has friends
[11436.45s -> 11439.01s]  All right, you rest and then we'll get you on the
[11440.61s -> 11450.05s]  Book again
[11450.05s -> 11454.37s]  Tons of power. That's a good life increase. I'm just gonna keep i'm gonna spam life on spirid
[11458.98s -> 11461.30s]  Uh, yeah, I could I could go for like a corned beef sandwich right now
[11465.68s -> 11466.96s]  You're good
[11466.96s -> 11469.52s]  Who's not having who's having a rough time here? Oh you okay?
[11473.92s -> 11477.70s]  What about avocado toast?
[11477.78s -> 11479.22s]  Yeah, I mean I
[11479.22s -> 11492.35s]  Avocado toast is man. I'd put an egg on it. That's just for me. You know, I don't order it but sometimes it's available
[11497.74s -> 11499.98s]  Like a poached egg or a nice like cooked egg on top
[11500.70s -> 11515.36s]  That's vegan. Well, that's not what I mean a vegan food. What do you mean?
[11516.00s -> 11518.69s]  I just told you I put an egg on it
[11525.60s -> 11529.10s]  I need to win
[11529.10s -> 11531.25s]  All right, he's dead
[11531.25s -> 11533.25s]  He'll be dead real soon. I gotta be
[11533.25s -> 11534.45s]  Uh
[11534.45s -> 11538.29s]  How do I pronounce caramel?
[11539.20s -> 11542.62s]  It depends on the day
[11542.62s -> 11545.34s]  Caramel caramel caramel caramel
[11545.98s -> 11548.19s]  I don't know. It just depends
[11548.19s -> 11558.24s]  You're all good
[11558.24s -> 11559.36s]  continue
[11559.36s -> 11561.36s]  Save it. Did I save it? Just do it again
[11577.85s -> 11578.99s]  Caramel
[11578.99s -> 11586.02s]  Okay. Well, I need to look at stats because unprover has seriously gained 20 in
[11586.90s -> 11602.18s]  A couple of categories more than four or five times. Let me see this. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What are you doing?
[11602.18s -> 11604.90s]  What are you doing? Stop shaking around. What the fuck is this? Hey
[11606.10s -> 11611.49s]  Hey
[11611.49s -> 11613.25s]  What is this doing this for?
[11613.25s -> 11625.65s]  What are you doing?
[11625.65s -> 11635.09s]  Uh, why are you doing this? This is weird. My shit's like getting all fucked up
[11643.20s -> 11646.40s]  Uh, this might be like a bug in the game. Not necessarily the hardware I have
[11646.88s -> 11650.91s]  Okay, that was weird
[11650.91s -> 11663.25s]  Now that was a game. That was a bug in the game
[11663.25s -> 11667.23s]  Strange. Anyways, what was I doing? I was looking at it over here
[11671.63s -> 11673.63s]  Joke incoming? No. No, I just
[11673.63s -> 11674.99s]  I
[11674.99s -> 11678.19s]  It's just that screen
[11678.19s -> 11680.19s]  Don't ask me why the hell that happens on
[11680.51s -> 11690.14s]  This own why are you doing? It's probably the winter. Um, I'd really love to look at the stats
[11691.10s -> 11696.74s]  Apparently not though
[11696.74s -> 11698.74s]  Well, I was gonna have to try tomorrow
[11700.98s -> 11708.48s]  I'm out of food. Fuck. I'm out of food
[11717.90s -> 11721.50s]  I thought the disc was fucking up at first. Yeah
[11722.70s -> 11725.90s]  Uh, I need I gotta feed you something beef
[11727.65s -> 11729.65s]  You're not gonna want that beef though. I don't think
[11730.05s -> 11742.98s]  I have five beef. Why am I playing this?
[11744.90s -> 11746.90s]  This is I like this game
[11747.30s -> 11749.46s]  Will you eat, uh
[11749.46s -> 11752.02s]  chocolate
[11752.02s -> 11763.84s]  Here have a chocolate you liked it good
[11765.70s -> 11767.70s]  All right, you're gonna have to wait
[11768.53s -> 11770.93s]  You're gonna have to eat something here, too
[11771.97s -> 11780.61s]  You can have a beef too
[11780.61s -> 11782.77s]  What's a food combo you like that nobody else likes?
[11783.66s -> 11786.86s]  I like cut up cucumber and cold hot dogs with hot sauce and lemon juice
[11787.58s -> 11789.50s]  well
[11789.50s -> 11791.50s]  I'll tell you one of my favorite things in the world
[11791.58s -> 11794.30s]  I'm, not sure I ever talked about this before but let's talk about it now
[11795.10s -> 11796.70s]  I love
[11796.70s -> 11798.78s]  nice firm crispy french fries
[11800.35s -> 11801.95s]  I dip them
[11801.95s -> 11803.39s]  in tuna
[11803.39s -> 11805.50s]  Like tuna fish
[11805.50s -> 11807.50s]  If I have fries in a tuna sandwich or something
[11809.26s -> 11813.34s]  I'm talking about the mayo whipped up tuna fish sandwich type tuna
[11814.29s -> 11815.81s]  And dip fries in it
[11815.81s -> 11820.80s]  And it's it's really good. It tastes great. It's got a lot going on there
[11823.42s -> 11830.06s]  Yeah, like tuna salad like a tuna fish that's mixed in like a the kind of tuna fish you order in a sub or you put on a sandwich
[11831.86s -> 11833.86s]  Also on top of that pretzel
[11833.86s -> 11835.30s]  uh, if you do
[11835.30s -> 11840.18s]  One of the my favorite snacks was just make a bunch of tuna take like a one or two cans of tuna
[11840.50s -> 11843.38s]  Whip it up with the mayonnaise add a little sprinkle a little bit of fucking basil in there
[11844.02s -> 11848.50s]  Don't do that. But you know, i'm making a joke reference to the last like four or five hours of talking
[11849.38s -> 11852.82s]  And just dip pretzels like hard pretzels into the tuna fish and eat it
[11857.38s -> 11859.38s]  I'm serious like that's it's fantastic
[11860.96s -> 11862.56s]  another thing
[11862.56s -> 11866.64s]  Weirdly enough this and this isn't a staple. I know but not this way
[11867.44s -> 11871.12s]  if you take a hard pretzel, like if you go get a bag of pretzels from the grocery store, whatever
[11872.00s -> 11872.88s]  and
[11872.88s -> 11874.88s]  uh american cheese
[11875.04s -> 11877.04s]  Just slices of american cheese
[11877.70s -> 11881.30s]  Take one slice of american cheese take a bite of the pretzel
[11881.86s -> 11884.66s]  And then take a little bit of the american cheese and put it in your mouth and eat it
[11885.14s -> 11887.62s]  At the same time the combination of those two things
[11888.90s -> 11890.90s]  Is godlike
[11890.98s -> 11892.98s]  It is absolutely godlike
[11896.27s -> 11901.95s]  You have to try it
[11901.95s -> 11904.43s]  Normal cheese. No, it's it's it's got to just be like
[11905.37s -> 11908.98s]  american cheese
[11908.98s -> 11910.72s]  Don't melt it
[11910.72s -> 11914.96s]  To see that the flavor doesn't make any sense. It's a perfect flavor combination
[11917.12s -> 11920.48s]  You could do you could do it with cheddar too. You could but i'm just giving you my recommendation
[11929.09s -> 11932.61s]  You could do that with pretty much any cold sliced cheese
[11933.25s -> 11935.01s]  I wouldn't do it with swiss
[11935.01s -> 11936.77s]  cheddar american
[11936.77s -> 11939.49s]  Provolone provolone is amazing with this exact technique
[11940.51s -> 11944.51s]  In fact, I'd probably recommend provolone and the hard pretzel over american cheese and hard pretzel
[11945.07s -> 11955.14s]  And that's fine. Everybody can say what they want. I'm just telling you that's it tastes so good together
[11961.15s -> 11963.15s]  It is a secret technique
[11974.78s -> 11978.86s]  Pretzels and cheese together. Yeah, but people when people eating pretzels and cheese
[11979.92s -> 11982.40s]  They typically it's not just like a sliced deli cheese
[11982.96s -> 11989.68s]  And biting hard pretzel pretzels and cheese is a big baked pretzel with a cheese dipping sauce not the same
[11990.32s -> 11993.04s]  It does not taste the same. It's incredibly different. Trust me
[11995.68s -> 12013.44s]  I'm gonna open up my own fucking restaurant tuna and french fries
[12014.48s -> 12017.68s]  Sliced provolone cheese and hard pretzels that I bought from the grocery store
[12019.81s -> 12025.24s]  Basil lemonade ice cream. Let's get some mangoes
[12026.50s -> 12033.92s]  You'd be out of business in minutes. I disagree
[12040.75s -> 12041.95s]  Oh
[12041.95s -> 12044.85s]  Yeah, like 300 bucks for a uh watermelon
[12046.11s -> 12047.95s]  I have to replace it
[12047.95s -> 12056.13s]  It's a you unless but wait what I got plenty of beef still. Let's just get a couple more of them
[12058.27s -> 12060.27s]  Grab a few bananas
[12060.51s -> 12072.83s]  And be on our way
[12072.83s -> 12074.83s]  I wouldn't be able to even beat diner dash
[12075.23s -> 12077.73s]  Why would I play diner dash?
[12077.81s -> 12087.97s]  Diner dash is the type of game that your mom accidentally downloaded in a virus facebook website and she's still playing it for some reason
[12095.74s -> 12102.38s]  But that's fine
[12103.02s -> 12105.02s]  Because it's good
[12105.98s -> 12111.58s]  But that's I can't backtrack that one, but you know, that's fine
[12115.30s -> 12117.30s]  Fuck oh
[12120.83s -> 12122.83s]  Hey somebody needs to give a lot of money
[12123.95s -> 12126.91s]  50 bucks from kxc 5000 bits. Thank you
[12127.55s -> 12134.64s]  Thank you for the 50 dollars 5000 bits loving the monster rancher streams germa
[12135.20s -> 12137.20s]  These games are comfy as fuck. No lie
[12138.96s -> 12140.96s]  Yeah, I love playing games like this
[12141.12s -> 12143.30s]  because we could just sit here and just
[12143.30s -> 12147.54s]  Talk shit about whatever we want and just have anything we want any topic can be rifled out here
[12148.10s -> 12150.91s]  It doesn't matter. We just talk about anything
[12151.49s -> 12153.89s]  Half the things we're saying aren't even real but still fun
[12154.61s -> 12158.91s]  It's just comfy game
[12158.91s -> 12161.31s]  But thank you for the 50 dollars 5000 bits kxc
[12162.11s -> 12166.06s]  insane contributions
[12166.70s -> 12171.28s]  Play animal crossing when the new one comes out i'll play it
[12175.46s -> 12178.02s]  I'm gonna but by the way that stream title is gonna be
[12179.17s -> 12181.17s]  trying not to rage
[12181.25s -> 12185.92s]  At animal crossing like and then like in parentheses like death counter
[12186.56s -> 12195.22s]  Okay, you're gonna rest and then we'll do life training
[12198.91s -> 12203.97s]  stack health
[12203.97s -> 12205.97s]  You can do
[12207.02s -> 12208.38s]  Target
[12208.38s -> 12210.38s]  You can rest
[12210.62s -> 12216.05s]  You're he's probably so close to death and I didn't even get to a rank
[12216.77s -> 12219.76s]  Because i'm supposed to take
[12219.76s -> 12227.36s]  Uh, I think i'm gonna bring him in to the jungle and try to get that next rank to unlock the new monsters. I have to try
[12229.66s -> 12232.94s]  Yeah, everybody rest up. We're taking the strong. We're gonna take Roberto
[12233.98s -> 12236.99s]  spiroid and blossom
[12236.99s -> 12238.19s]  into the
[12238.19s -> 12248.24s]  Forest not the forest the jungle has to be done
[12260.85s -> 12262.85s]  And then we have to combine
[12264.40s -> 12266.88s]  I need at least to get to a rank before I move on from this game
[12268.78s -> 12271.26s]  You know like I have to at least unlock a rank
[12271.98s -> 12273.98s]  What an accomplishment that would be
[12278.53s -> 12280.21s]  Okay jungle
[12280.21s -> 12282.21s]  Let's bring Roberto
[12283.06s -> 12285.14s]  And spiroid and blossom
[12286.02s -> 12289.46s]  These are the ones that are doing well here. Let's just say this is a good place to look at stats
[12292.83s -> 12296.11s]  Pretty balanced across the board life intelligence and accuracy
[12296.83s -> 12298.83s]  Actually really balanced across the board
[12301.52s -> 12303.36s]  You are like better than
[12303.36s -> 12305.18s]  spiroid
[12305.18s -> 12307.18s]  64 to 12
[12308.04s -> 12311.12s]  I don't balanced
[12313.84s -> 12315.84s]  Look at the power on Roberto
[12316.35s -> 12321.47s]  He's at almost 500 power. I have to get him in the next tournament before he dies
[12329.96s -> 12332.33s]  All right, let's go
[12343.87s -> 12348.73s]  I should start a lunchables restaurant. How long do you think it would take?
[12350.96s -> 12355.04s]  So if I opened up a restaurant called like germa's food or welcome to the restaurant
[12355.04s -> 12357.52s]  What doesn't matter whatever the fucking placeholder name can be
[12358.08s -> 12361.44s]  How long would it take if I were to buy a bunch of frozen dinners and shit
[12363.79s -> 12368.51s]  Like stuff from the grocery store unpackage it like heat it up and like pretend and put it on the menu and all that
[12370.60s -> 12382.91s]  How long would it take for someone to figure out that I wasn't making this food a few hours? I don't think so
[12383.55s -> 12388.28s]  If I went to the frozen section
[12389.34s -> 12392.30s]  And picked out like like like hungry man
[12395.28s -> 12397.36s]  And plated it so it looked really nice
[12398.70s -> 12412.25s]  It would probably take a little while
[12412.25s -> 12418.51s]  Oh, I have a burger on the menu and it's just the frozen patty from the grocery store and I just I put like
[12419.15s -> 12425.12s]  Kale on it and shit. I put like a nice little garlic sauce on it and I don't think people would know
[12436.96s -> 12438.96s]  That's literally what they do
[12447.12s -> 12452.32s]  Microwaving a tv dinner and then putting it and presenting it a different way on a plate
[12453.61s -> 12455.61s]  and calling it like
[12455.69s -> 12457.69s]  chicken a la carte
[12458.01s -> 12460.56s]  and it's like the
[12460.56s -> 12461.76s]  kid cuisine
[12461.76s -> 12463.04s]  Fried chicken
[12463.04s -> 12473.77s]  I really think would take a couple months before somebody figured it out. I worked at a restaurant for three years. We did that
[12475.29s -> 12477.29s]  people actually doing that
[12482.24s -> 12484.24s]  With blue pudding
[12485.92s -> 12487.92s]  Yeah, like the shitty little
[12488.00s -> 12490.00s]  Square brownie thing that they have
[12490.64s -> 12492.40s]  That's on there too
[12492.40s -> 12498.22s]  The brownie that is the whole it's like a well
[12498.86s -> 12501.90s]  And it's supposed to be a brownie, but it's just a well of chocolate cake mix
[12510.52s -> 12522.35s]  Corn that's half frozen eating it uncooked is the best
[12523.23s -> 12531.74s]  I've never done that
[12531.74s -> 12533.74s]  Like the you go, okay
[12533.82s -> 12539.18s]  You would be able to figure it out really really quickly if it was a kid. Okay. Remember the Lunchables pizzas
[12540.94s -> 12545.90s]  Imagine ordering a pizza from a restaurant and the Lunchables pizza comes out
[12546.54s -> 12551.36s]  That would be a bad business move. It would have to be stuff that would be easily hideable
[12552.75s -> 12557.88s]  For see
[12557.88s -> 12567.61s]  Yeah, you wouldn't be able to get away with the
[12567.77s -> 12570.49s]  Lunchables deli meat stack circle things
[12571.37s -> 12574.27s]  It would have to be
[12574.27s -> 12576.27s]  the chicken nuggets
[12577.10s -> 12579.34s]  Kid cuisine lean cuisine type stuff
[12580.22s -> 12582.14s]  the turkey dinner
[12582.14s -> 12587.26s]  They put the three or four slabs of turkey in the gravy. You could get away with that if you presented it correctly
[12599.05s -> 12602.96s]  a jack in the chow
[12602.96s -> 12613.00s]  Is this a fight? I think this is like a minute like a hidden. Okay
[12613.88s -> 12616.92s]  I can't counter. He missed it kill him in one hit
[12617.80s -> 12628.81s]  All right. What is it? What do I get?
[12632.14s -> 12639.16s]  What's the point of that? Did you get anything?
[12639.16s -> 12640.68s]  nothing
[12640.68s -> 12641.72s]  All right
[12641.72s -> 12648.28s]  It's just a mimic. I don't remember the last time I had
[12650.24s -> 12652.00s]  one of those
[12652.00s -> 12654.00s]  like thanksgiving dinner
[12654.22s -> 12656.40s]  microwaved lean cuisine esque
[12657.95s -> 12659.31s]  tv dinners
[12659.31s -> 12670.51s]  Was it good? I don't remember
[12672.43s -> 12675.71s]  All I have in my mind anytime. I think of one of these tv dinners
[12677.10s -> 12678.94s]  Is the taste
[12678.94s -> 12680.94s]  of low quality gravy
[12681.42s -> 12683.90s]  That's it. No other flavor comes to mind just
[12684.78s -> 12687.26s]  kind of watery low quality gravy
[12688.06s -> 12694.68s]  And i'm talking not even for the thanksgiving one. I'm talking even for the fried chicken one
[12699.80s -> 12705.37s]  Who can dig?
[12705.37s -> 12712.04s]  Which one of them can dig?
[12712.04s -> 12714.48s]  Of plant plants aren't even here
[12728.46s -> 12730.94s]  Stouffer's
[12730.94s -> 12732.94s]  Yeah stouffer's stouffer's does have
[12733.50s -> 12735.50s]  Sort of just one flavor doesn't it?
[12736.41s -> 12738.81s]  All I think of is stuffing gravy taste
[12742.59s -> 12746.11s]  I'm thinking of the macaroni and cheese and I all I think of is gravy stuffing
[12746.67s -> 12751.98s]  Stouffer's is just oven flavor
[12756.60s -> 12758.60s]  Why do I know what that means?
[12759.95s -> 12763.88s]  I know what you mean by that. I understand what you're saying
[12767.16s -> 12775.55s]  It's oven flavored
[12775.61s -> 12780.16s]  macaroni and gravy
[12780.16s -> 12782.80s]  Would you guys like to know what the best macaroni and cheese is?
[12785.04s -> 12787.76s]  I can tell you the best store macaroni and cheese
[12796.60s -> 12801.88s]  No, and it is not the yellow earwax mac and cheese. It's not that one. I'm not gonna say the name
[12809.72s -> 12820.72s]  king's fist
[12820.72s -> 12826.64s]  The best macaroni and cheese from the store that you can possibly buy this cracker bread
[12827.20s -> 12831.93s]  If you don't believe me try the cracker barrel challenge
[12844.91s -> 12846.27s]  It is the best
[12846.27s -> 12850.54s]  That you can possibly buy
[12850.54s -> 12852.54s]  I do not take that lightly
[12853.18s -> 12865.18s]  Is this stream sponsored? No, this stream tells you real things that the stream believes
[12865.98s -> 12886.89s]  None of this is paid for if you don't if you never had it before just try it next time
[12888.25s -> 12891.93s]  Next time you're at the store or the grocery store if it carries it
[12892.73s -> 12895.47s]  Just try it
[12895.47s -> 12897.47s]  Make it on the stove. You have to make it on the stove
[12897.71s -> 12903.45s]  Try it come back
[12904.43s -> 12907.55s]  And tell me that that was not in your top three
[12908.89s -> 12910.89s]  grocery store mac and cheese
[12912.52s -> 12915.80s]  If it was not in your top three grocery store mac and cheeses
[12916.76s -> 12924.38s]  Then I will remove you from the channel I will get you ip banned from my channel I will remove your
[12925.34s -> 12928.30s]  Name, I will make sure that the name never pops up again
[12938.19s -> 12940.19s]  Now I will respect your opinion
[12941.24s -> 12942.56s]  but
[12942.56s -> 12952.16s]  grunt
[12952.16s -> 12957.28s]  Cracker barrel is my favorite. It's number one. It's my favorite. It's in my pantry right now. Please don't ban me
[12959.16s -> 12964.12s]  We don't have crappy us mac and cheeses over here mac and cheese is like as
[12965.00s -> 12967.00s]  Us american as you could possibly get
[12975.66s -> 12981.71s]  mac and cheese is
[12981.71s -> 12983.47s]  American. Whoa
[12983.47s -> 12988.97s]  When am I gonna go on hot ones?
[12989.96s -> 12992.60s]  I'm not fucking cool enough to go on hot ones guys
[12994.04s -> 12996.68s]  I don't have enough clout to go on hot ones. What are you talking about?
[13004.30s -> 13006.70s]  I can't go on hot ones guys. I don't have an instagram
[13010.92s -> 13014.84s]  I would have to make an instagram and take a picture today and just post it there
[13015.48s -> 13023.36s]  I can't fly over that
[13023.36s -> 13029.20s]  So today we're going to be talking about what it's called what's happened in that pic and it seems that you have this instagram
[13029.20s -> 13034.48s]  Picture here. We're going to go back to 2018 2019. What is this? What happened here?
[13035.28s -> 13037.36s]  I made that account like four days ago
[13037.36s -> 13041.28s]  And I took the picture because I knew that you were going to ask me a question about an instagram picture and I
[13041.44s -> 13043.44s]  That's the only one I got. It's me smiling
[13043.92s -> 13044.80s]  uh
[13044.80s -> 13047.52s]  With a like a just like a gray backdrop behind it
[13049.31s -> 13051.95s]  All right, man. Well, thanks for coming out here for hot ones
[13052.83s -> 13054.83s]  I actually like that show. It's not bad
[13064.64s -> 13068.00s]  How well would I do? I would do very well in that show. I wouldn't have any milk wouldn't have any water
[13068.64s -> 13073.80s]  I would be completely fine
[13086.30s -> 13088.30s]  I would be perfectly fine
[13088.54s -> 13093.76s]  It says the guy with digestive problems. So no, I mean I later I wouldn't be but I wouldn't I wouldn't be like
[13097.44s -> 13099.20s]  I'd be fine
[13099.20s -> 13103.52s]  Where's the milk?
[13103.52s -> 13123.13s]  That wouldn't happen. I'd be okay. What's going on with the internet here? Oh no
[13130.03s -> 13151.72s]  Are we good? They have a hot ones. How come they don't have a cold ones?
[13153.29s -> 13156.17s]  It starts off you drink like a room temperature water
[13156.89s -> 13161.96s]  And eventually it gets to like ice cream popsicles and then you get to like
[13162.58s -> 13166.32s]  nitrogen
[13166.32s -> 13175.60s]  They do have that
[13181.29s -> 13183.55s]  Everybody okay
[13183.55s -> 13188.11s]  I know everyone's really obsessed with hot hot sauce on their food, right? Hot hot hot
[13190.28s -> 13193.48s]  Yeah, yeah, but let me get some hot sauce on that sandwich. Let me get some hot
[13194.86s -> 13201.61s]  Franks red hot whatever right? Is there a reason why people aren't like nitrogen infusing their green beans?
[13202.57s -> 13221.80s]  Why does it not go the other way? Why is it only hot because you can get hurt with nitrogen
[13222.52s -> 13225.87s]  You can get hurt with hot sauce too. You eat like a hot
[13226.81s -> 13228.81s]  California whatever it is a reaper
[13229.31s -> 13233.04s]  People have like gone to the hospital because of that shit
[13233.68s -> 13248.89s]  Spicy is a flavor cold is not that's true. But how come somebody hasn't invented?
[13250.14s -> 13262.70s]  Like in a lab somewhere like cold as like a condiment. I can't keep that up. I'm sorry. There's only so far I can go
[13264.67s -> 13266.43s]  Menthol
[13266.43s -> 13269.39s]  Why are you not putting menthol on your french fries?
[13283.16s -> 13285.24s]  Yeah, mint is cold spice that's true
[13290.91s -> 13293.15s]  menthol mac and cheese
[13293.23s -> 13294.27s]  I
[13294.27s -> 13304.68s]  You might be onto something there. Oh a spicy italian sausage. No menthol italian sausage
[13319.72s -> 13321.72s]  That would be actually gross
[13336.51s -> 13338.51s]  That's some real hipster shit
[13342.00s -> 13345.68s]  No, I even I can't continue to talk about that shit white pot
[13347.00s -> 13349.00s]  I have to draw the line at like
[13350.12s -> 13353.50s]  We're just talking shit at menthol sausages
[13369.61s -> 13372.65s]  Can I please find this so I can level up my characters and do another?
[13373.69s -> 13375.48s]  Come on
[13375.48s -> 13377.48s]  Before the stream ends we need to see
[13378.19s -> 13380.03s]  wind lore
[13380.03s -> 13382.19s]  Spyroid can't obtain any more traits
[13383.07s -> 13389.47s]  Abandoned wind lore. Uh-oh. What how do I remove a trait?
[13397.40s -> 13399.56s]  Remove wind lore
[13404.95s -> 13406.73s]  Inferno
[13406.73s -> 13409.68s]  Okay, good thing. I just did that
[13409.68s -> 13411.68s]  Because I use fire on that character all the time
[13422.81s -> 13425.37s]  I just want to do
[13427.29s -> 13430.49s]  The next tournament, but I have to find the lost people here
[13431.61s -> 13436.25s]  So Roberto can one shot the boss and we can go and move on with our lives
[13437.21s -> 13463.12s]  Come on. Why is everybody freaking out?
[13465.07s -> 13470.72s]  Why are you freaking out?
[13470.72s -> 13473.52s]  I got Roberto here. He's got just 500 attack power
[13474.24s -> 13477.74s]  And he's level 13
[13477.74s -> 13484.67s]  Earth lore. He doesn't know
[13493.71s -> 13496.01s]  He doesn't know
[13496.01s -> 13497.45s]  Neither do you
[13497.45s -> 13504.62s]  What's the percentage of the people that have even played this game before that are here?
[13505.58s -> 13516.91s]  Don't ever get rid of lore
[13526.01s -> 13527.13s]  Bingo
[13527.13s -> 13530.43s]  I'm doing 250 to 500 damage a swing
[13531.31s -> 13533.31s]  And that's not even with my big move
[13533.87s -> 13537.90s]  And that's just pressing x
[13538.46s -> 13541.63s]  Okay, blossom. What do you got?
[13541.63s -> 13553.26s]  Ruby, that's it. How much longer till Roberto dies of old age? Very soon
[13554.88s -> 13556.88s]  So i'm saving the game
[13557.90s -> 13560.30s]  at every point that i'm pretty much allowed to save
[13561.85s -> 13563.13s]  and
[13563.13s -> 13566.00s]  When he dies, we're going to rewind time
[13567.93s -> 13570.65s]  And we're going to freeze him and fuse him probably with dragon
[13572.96s -> 13586.22s]  Maybe you can call it. Yeah, you can call me scum if you want. That's fine. You can call me scum
[13586.78s -> 13608.52s]  Can you speak like courage the cowardly dog courage? Does doesn't courage not talk?
[13609.48s -> 13611.48s]  Doesn't he only just go like
[13613.16s -> 13629.47s]  That's pretty much all he does right
[13629.47s -> 13631.47s]  Oh, he talked to the camera. That's true
[13631.87s -> 13634.48s]  I don't even kind of
[13634.48s -> 13636.80s]  I can't really place where his voice sounds like
[13641.79s -> 13643.79s]  I got cute and it's gonna be bad
[13650.20s -> 13652.52s]  Sorry, I just wanted to do 300 plus damage
[13653.40s -> 13656.03s]  We'll do it again. I'm gonna do as hard as I can
[13657.55s -> 13659.23s]  48 guts watch this
[13659.23s -> 13674.38s]  That's it

[13693.13s -> 13695.64s]  stop
[13695.64s -> 13700.51s]  Stop this
[13701.07s -> 13711.29s]  Don't stop 290. It's not enough
[13711.93s -> 13718.35s]  Everybody gets final guts with me
[13725.61s -> 13727.37s]  Nice good follow-up
[13727.37s -> 13741.53s]  Did I see the episode of dexter's lab when they swear?
[13743.24s -> 13745.08s]  I don't think so
[13745.08s -> 13748.94s]  I don't think i've seen that
[13748.94s -> 13753.53s]  Did somebody search this?
[13753.53s -> 13757.16s]  Somebody can here, right?
[13757.16s -> 13759.98s]  Lawson can search, right?
[13759.98s -> 13761.98s]  Investigate what's in there?
[13761.98s -> 13770.94s]  Okay, I don't want anyone to panic but
[13770.94s -> 13773.18s]  I just took a sip out of my coffee
[13773.50s -> 13775.58s]  And there was something solid that I just swallowed
[13778.35s -> 13780.35s]  That was weird
[13787.72s -> 13791.16s]  I think I just I think I swallowed chicken bone. Look there's a chicken bone in my coffee
[13795.71s -> 13797.87s]  Don't you hate it when you have chicken bones in your coffee?
[13798.43s -> 13803.55s]  This sucks. I don't want to look around here anymore
[13806.99s -> 13808.99s]  You just drank up a spider
[13809.88s -> 13813.16s]  My brother told me this the only reason why I think about this and my brother told me a story
[13815.05s -> 13817.77s]  About how he did that. Oh, I can't even think about it
[13821.55s -> 13826.11s]  Oh god, okay. I'm gonna I can I even tell the story. It's so fucked up. It's just horrible
[13828.49s -> 13830.49s]  Well, it's making me like shiver
[13830.89s -> 13835.85s]  So, all right, if you're queasy about spiders and shit mute the stream for like five minutes
[13836.81s -> 13842.33s]  All right. Here we go. Three two one. Hey, what's going on guys? Welcome to the video. My name's jim. I got a story for you here
[13843.95s -> 13846.51s]  Uh in the background is gonna be some monster rancher four
[13848.01s -> 13850.73s]  And it got me thinking at this one time
[13851.45s -> 13853.45s]  That my brother told me the story
[13854.80s -> 13857.28s]  About how when he sucked up a spider through his straw
[13858.62s -> 13859.58s]  and
[13859.58s -> 13861.58s]  I'll tell it for you. Here we go
[13861.66s -> 13863.02s]  so, uh
[13863.02s -> 13864.38s]  my brother
[13864.38s -> 13868.14s]  Made coffee. It's like the similar situation. Oh my god. Did I do that?
[13871.88s -> 13875.80s]  Yeah, he made coffee in his coffee maker, which I did
[13877.29s -> 13879.61s]  And he had a glass and ice and coffee
[13880.57s -> 13882.57s]  And he was drinking his coffee
[13883.36s -> 13885.36s]  and he slurped up a
[13886.00s -> 13888.00s]  Super big solid object
[13888.96s -> 13890.96s]  And he like spit it out
[13892.44s -> 13894.44s]  And it was a huge spider
[13896.19s -> 13919.44s]  And he freaked out but I may have swallowed it. I don't even want to think about that. I hate the unknown
[13920.62s -> 13921.98s]  Stuff like that
[13921.98s -> 13929.40s]  Anytime something like that happens. You just don't know
[13930.04s -> 13932.04s]  Well, what the hell was that? What could that have been?
[13932.60s -> 13952.64s]  Don't worry tomorrow. You'll have powers
[13955.79s -> 13957.79s]  Ooh, this is a tobita c
[13958.35s -> 13960.91s]  Okay
[13960.91s -> 13964.91s]  Okay, this is the building chat was talking about they said he doesn't know
[13972.68s -> 13976.84s]  God i've got the all-powerful roberto with his one hit kill moves
[13983.29s -> 13985.53s]  I can't wait to get a pastrami sandwich
[13987.40s -> 13989.40s]  thunder lore
[13989.50s -> 13991.50s]  Abandoned thunder lore
[14005.61s -> 14016.75s]  Zap I got a tablet. Hold on. What how can I remove?
[14017.31s -> 14020.59s]  Lore or something what's going on here? I have to keep all these
[14023.88s -> 14025.40s]  seriously, why
[14025.40s -> 14027.40s]  Do I have to have all these?
[14027.64s -> 14029.64s]  I can't remove them 4c
[14030.44s -> 14039.02s]  What's the point of having all these traits if you just it fills a list and then you you're stuck
[14039.66s -> 14058.64s]  Local boomer can't read. No, I know I can I can remove them or not remove them
[14058.64s -> 14061.52s]  But let me can I just take the ones I don't want off?
[14064.20s -> 14068.04s]  Not at the menu where I learned them. You can remove them at the ranch then god
[14074.76s -> 14079.48s]  Uh-oh
[14079.48s -> 14081.48s]  Thank god, this is the thing that fucked it up last time
[14082.20s -> 14085.42s]  Didn't have roberto though
[14085.42s -> 14095.88s]  All right. Come on internet. Stop it. You're starting to make me angry
[14102.41s -> 14104.41s]  I think this is the last place
[14116.28s -> 14118.28s]  This is a jaguar
[14123.34s -> 14125.34s]  Thank god. I've got roberto. He's
[14126.20s -> 14127.42s]  unstoppable
[14127.42s -> 14132.25s]  Get to a rank
[14132.25s -> 14134.81s]  How long is this game? It's kind of never ending
[14138.40s -> 14143.90s]  I don't think the game ends
[14144.22s -> 14152.41s]  It's the seventh floor of this jungle
[14154.86s -> 14156.86s]  If you finish s rank it ends
[14157.50s -> 14160.96s]  I'm, not sure i'm going to be able to do that because roberto is going to die
[14164.48s -> 14167.20s]  And then i'm going to have a new monster to try to play around with
[14172.94s -> 14174.94s]  Okay. Yeah, you can unmute. Yeah unmute
[14177.44s -> 14179.70s]  Lifestyle, okay cool tablets more tablets
[14208.64s -> 14213.31s]  Beat the game dump ass
[14213.31s -> 14216.35s]  To get s rank you need to fuse two a ranks
[14218.64s -> 14224.24s]  So I have to get hold on so I need to fuse two a rank. So I have to get roberto to a rank
[14225.72s -> 14227.48s]  fuse him
[14227.48s -> 14229.12s]  with
[14229.12s -> 14231.52s]  the dragon get the dragon to a
[14232.08s -> 14236.32s]  Fuse two people together and get those two a fuse them together and then bring those two
[14237.71s -> 14238.91s]  to s
[14238.91s -> 14246.81s]  Oh god, kraikin just came in with a raid. Hello everybody
[14247.84s -> 14249.20s]  kraikin raid
[14249.20s -> 14251.80s]  Thanks a lot kraikin. Hope you had a good stream
[14252.52s -> 14255.40s]  Not sure what you planned, but I hope it was fun
[14256.60s -> 14257.96s]  Welcome everybody
[14257.96s -> 14262.86s]  Oh god, i'm gonna die. Don't die. It'll actually kill him if he dies
[14263.82s -> 14265.82s]  No, don't counter it. Oh, this is bad
[14266.78s -> 14267.74s]  No
[14267.74s -> 14271.34s]  Three hp bring out somebody else anybody anyone. I don't care who it is
[14272.06s -> 14278.12s]  This will kill him. He'll die
[14278.28s -> 14283.00s]  Come on not they not a new audience coming in just kill them
[14284.25s -> 14286.25s]  Oh, this is fucking horrible
[14287.93s -> 14289.93s]  All of a sudden everybody doesn't want to do any moves
[14290.52s -> 14293.56s]  You see this?
[14293.56s -> 14305.16s]  Thank god. We're playing monster rancher 4. This is a game where you breed monsters
[14306.32s -> 14308.08s]  You put cds in
[14308.08s -> 14310.08s]  And it pulls a random seed
[14310.59s -> 14316.65s]  And you can fuse them together. You can mess around with dna. It's pretty interesting
[14319.05s -> 14327.45s]  And we can't go that way. I do not want you in the front now
[14327.93s -> 14330.99s]  Oh my god, why are we getting so many of these random encounters?
[14331.71s -> 14334.52s]  They're increased exponentially
[14339.48s -> 14344.70s]  Sorry, this thing sucks
[14344.70s -> 14346.70s]  No, it doesn't I gotta do a different move
[14346.86s -> 14357.02s]  Where's my bite?
[14357.02s -> 14358.57s]  bullish
[14358.57s -> 14362.25s]  Bullish come on grave throw bullish again. Come on
[14362.89s -> 14372.27s]  Just hit it
[14372.27s -> 14375.71s]  Just let me end this encounter. I need to find these people here
[14387.39s -> 14389.39s]  God my god
[14389.71s -> 14391.15s]  Please
[14391.15s -> 14393.15s]  Uh, this is really bad
[14393.79s -> 14399.10s]  There's a group of people on an expedition that I have to find down here and for some reason
[14399.90s -> 14403.16s]  This won't let me leave this area
[14403.16s -> 14420.96s]  This is bad. Don't counter it. Thank god
[14424.48s -> 14427.64s]  Kill him on 97 damage. That's it
[14428.44s -> 14439.52s]  All right, that's a double team move. You should die from this. Yeah
[14440.16s -> 14448.27s]  Unless you knew he has a clip explaining who he is
[14452.09s -> 14453.53s]  out of context
[14453.53s -> 14458.72s]  This looks way harder than it was last time
[14459.20s -> 14465.21s]  I can't even go this way
[14465.21s -> 14466.49s]  Uh, it's
[14466.49s -> 14469.29s]  I don't know if it's harder than it was last time. There's a lot of new mechanics
[14470.01s -> 14472.01s]  That the game has thrown in
[14472.09s -> 14474.33s]  these counters
[14474.33s -> 14475.93s]  can sometimes be pretty
[14475.93s -> 14477.77s]  Uh bullshit, but
[14477.77s -> 14488.22s]  Why are you looking all these?
[14488.22s -> 14503.37s]  Are you trying to scare everybody away? All right, i'm gonna pull Roberto back. No, i'm not
[14503.37s -> 14507.39s]  Like
[14507.39s -> 14510.40s]  Now I might have to
[14510.40s -> 14513.92s]  This dragon's defense is so bad. His health is so bad
[14515.36s -> 14530.41s]  That was the luigi side running move from smash brothers
[14531.29s -> 14541.76s]  Your whole team is shit
[14541.76s -> 14548.48s]  All we need is one character to do anything good
[14548.88s -> 14557.26s]  Somebody just has to get to a rank
[14557.72s -> 14559.56s]  And then we fuse them
[14559.56s -> 14561.56s]  With somebody else that's their friend
[14566.01s -> 14569.77s]  This has taken a long time. I'm on the seventh floor. How long have I been in here for?
[14570.57s -> 14572.57s]  30 40 straight minutes
[14577.21s -> 14599.58s]  Can't go this way
[14599.58s -> 14608.51s]  100 years
[14608.51s -> 14611.15s]  Switch back to Roberto. I mean if I can get the damage here
[14611.63s -> 14613.31s]  Uh, maybe not
[14613.31s -> 14618.22s]  I'd like to have you level up
[14618.62s -> 14622.12s]  Come on grab him. All right
[14622.20s -> 14626.91s]  Fine switch it up
[14626.91s -> 14628.35s]  Don't want him to kill
[14628.35s -> 14630.35s]  All right, bring in Roberto
[14631.39s -> 14648.54s]  You want to play that game?
[14648.54s -> 14652.30s]  Don't let the spider bite your stomach. I added that somebody just said bite you
[14658.20s -> 14660.96s]  I miss wall-e
[14661.04s -> 14662.64s]  Everybody misses wall-e
[14662.64s -> 14666.24s]  But the problem is wall-e unfortunately was not very good
[14675.90s -> 14680.96s]  So we had to freeze wall-e
[14680.96s -> 14684.59s]  I just went in a circle
[14684.59s -> 14686.19s]  Where am I supposed to go?
[14686.19s -> 14690.92s]  Oh, I could get up
[14691.66s -> 14693.10s]  Up here
[14693.10s -> 14698.00s]  All right. I made it
[14698.00s -> 14703.93s]  Thank god
[14703.93s -> 14705.93s]  Well, here's your beanbag sonic
[14708.24s -> 14710.56s]  Just be huge this time with an eye patch
[14713.47s -> 14717.08s]  Is he the one who kidnapped the folks around here?
[14717.96s -> 14719.96s]  Wait, he's trying to tell me something
[14722.03s -> 14725.63s]  I know what you're up to you're going to use that machine to alter us monsters
[14726.57s -> 14729.53s]  I know what evil you're up to my altered arm is proof
[14730.96s -> 14733.44s]  Alter the monsters. No, we would never do such a thing
[14734.40s -> 14738.96s]  Silence I can see through your plan. I've experienced far too much agony to stand by idly
[14739.52s -> 14742.78s]  I won't allow a single other monster to go through what I did
[14744.20s -> 14750.94s]  Please listen to us. We admit we use machines. We just we use gadgets but altering our monster friends
[14751.90s -> 14754.30s]  We would never ever do that. Please believe me
[14755.36s -> 14757.12s]  Your words tell me nothing
[14757.12s -> 14759.60s]  We shall fight and I shall gaze into your soul
[14760.89s -> 14762.89s]  No fain he refuses to listen
[14763.64s -> 14766.68s]  It's okay. We'll prove to him that rio's telling the truth of fighting
[14767.40s -> 14778.80s]  Why would that yeah, let's fight him. Let's prove let's prove him right
[14790.41s -> 14792.49s]  again
[14792.49s -> 14793.53s]  Chain it
[14793.53s -> 14795.53s]  Kill him not even fucking hard. Come on
[14796.92s -> 14799.08s]  Last hit get I need last hit fire last hit
[14802.28s -> 14807.37s]  You can do it
[14807.37s -> 14810.41s]  Come on fire last hit so you get the level up
[14823.21s -> 14825.93s]  You can't look please don't no don't die
[14829.05s -> 14831.05s]  It's okay. We're gonna be fine
[14831.13s -> 14835.45s]  It's okay the dragon died, but we're gonna get this last hit got it game over hard one
[14838.97s -> 14840.97s]  The dragon is uh
[14842.70s -> 14843.98s]  earth lore
[14843.98s -> 14845.98s]  mastered 10 out of 10
[14864.65s -> 14867.45s]  Please understand. We just want you to return the people you've kidnapped
[14868.17s -> 14870.17s]  We never meant to harm you
[14871.34s -> 14874.46s]  No matter let these wounds be a sign of the trust you earned
[14875.63s -> 14880.19s]  You need only to promise to me you will never alter monsters and I will return all the people
[14880.83s -> 14883.20s]  We could never let a monster suffer
[14884.12s -> 14888.52s]  Rio you have great promise the rest is up to you now. I take my leave
[14890.08s -> 14893.44s]  Don't he looks so sad altering monsters. It's just wrong
[14894.00s -> 14896.36s]  Whoever did this won't get away with it
[14902.81s -> 14905.61s]  You beat me you have my trust you hurt me
[14909.12s -> 14914.59s]  Fuck this garfield voice spy rod was injured. I'll send it to the hospital
[14918.40s -> 14921.04s]  I think we may have our priorities wrong here

[14926.11s -> 14928.99s]  Spyroid hasn't gotten better. I hope I hope it comes back soon
[14929.55s -> 14936.33s]  Excuse me. Hello

[15030.24s -> 15032.32s]  Intellect defense is actually really good
[15033.55s -> 15039.85s]  Just do a bunch more intellect and intellect. Yeah, read some books
[15051.32s -> 15057.72s]  Very balanced
[15058.28s -> 15060.28s]  Sandbag, yeah
[15061.40s -> 15063.48s]  Today you can do probably life
[15064.44s -> 15067.93s]  Who cares what you do?
[15067.93s -> 15078.86s]  Look at the look at the stat gains on unprover. That's ridiculous
[15079.90s -> 15081.90s]  All right. I think there's a change of plan here
[15083.24s -> 15088.44s]  Unprover has that's a that's the third or fourth in a row more than 20 stat points
[15089.16s -> 15108.89s]  You deserve this
[15108.89s -> 15131.07s]  Quills
[15131.07s -> 15133.07s]  Oh boy, you're like starving
[15133.23s -> 15134.83s]  um
[15134.83s -> 15136.83s]  Here have a have a banana
[15136.99s -> 15148.97s]  Is dragon gone?
[15148.97s -> 15158.12s]  Dragon actually is gone
[15161.58s -> 15163.58s]  Tired all right proceed
[15172.11s -> 15174.11s]  Uh, we're gonna go to town
[15174.19s -> 15177.07s]  The association let's finally get out of this rank
[15189.93s -> 15196.32s]  Ah to you I have something for you and it's this a breeder's rank b certificate
[15197.58s -> 15200.62s]  Now you can proudly enter the ima competition in tourable
[15201.71s -> 15205.23s]  and the ima competition is as much as I
[15206.62s -> 15209.26s]  Hate to admit it a tougher than our fimba competition
[15215.13s -> 15217.31s]  Everybody fucking hates this
[15217.47s -> 15219.96s]  What's wrong with you? What's that thing up?
[15219.96s -> 15224.76s]  Mr. Carnab, I have you heard of altered monsters. They're monsters with machines grafted to them
[15226.56s -> 15229.04s]  No, I can't say that I have
[15229.04s -> 15233.20s]  I like to fiddle with machines, but I could never imagine meddling machine with monster
[15234.86s -> 15238.14s]  Goodness gracious. I'm so busy. I've got to get going now. Ta ta
[15240.75s -> 15241.79s]  He's gone
[15241.79s -> 15245.34s]  That seems strange
[15245.34s -> 15247.34s]  Goodbye. Oh, where's mr. Carnab?
[15247.96s -> 15256.08s]  Oh philia glad to have run into you. There's something I wanted to ask you so that guy's evil. He's he's definitely manipulating monsters
[15257.31s -> 15264.43s]  Grafting hooks on them and stuff like a fucking psycho. Well, that's the situation. Do you know anything about it monster alterations?
[15265.07s -> 15270.99s]  I've never heard of such a thing. How cruel how awful like
[15272.28s -> 15274.28s]  not awful at all is
[15275.46s -> 15284.56s]  Breeding monsters and forcing them to fight each other for your own personal gain, but that's okay. That's that's fine
[15285.12s -> 15290.96s]  How cruel?
[15290.96s -> 15292.96s]  freezing them in canisters
[15294.16s -> 15298.64s]  And stuffing their dna into each other until you get what you want so it can fight in a tournament for you
[15307.50s -> 15311.36s]  Nendoro's arm was altered. I don't know who did it, but somebody surely did
[15311.92s -> 15314.73s]  Hmm. Why don't you try torbal?
[15315.13s -> 15320.25s]  That town is on the forefront of technology. You might be able to find some clues there
[15322.36s -> 15328.43s]  torpola
[15328.43s -> 15330.33s]  box off locked
[15330.33s -> 15331.85s]  uh-oh
[15331.85s -> 15336.16s]  Shit for those of you guys that came over from kraken stream if you don't save every fucking
[15336.80s -> 15339.05s]  single time
[15339.05s -> 15341.05s]  You get a softlock scenario which we're in right now
[15343.93s -> 15349.24s]  God damn it
[15349.24s -> 15351.96s]  Well, I mean, I don't know what the last time I saved it. Let me try something here
[15352.52s -> 15355.23s]  I'm gonna try to like blow into the microphone and see if it helps
[15357.80s -> 15360.40s]  It's a long shot, but we'll see
[15360.40s -> 15361.72s]  one
[15361.72s -> 15363.96s]  two three
[15366.60s -> 15395.52s]  Spyroid hasn't gotten better. That's not good. This is actually it's I think spyrode might actually die
[15398.62s -> 15401.90s]  I mean you did you did get one hit KO'd
[15403.23s -> 15405.63s]  He got the hook dug into his skull
[15411.26s -> 15414.46s]  so
[15414.46s -> 15417.10s]  We've got a new favorite best friend
[15418.87s -> 15420.33s]  unprover
[15420.33s -> 15429.85s]  Intelligence again
[15429.85s -> 15437.00s]  I'm gonna do i'm gonna try to get intelligence to like 300
[15438.03s -> 15440.11s]  Everything else is perfect. The health is fine
[15441.23s -> 15449.34s]  What about uh blossom?
[15449.50s -> 15451.26s]  Tired, do you have rest?
[15451.26s -> 15453.26s]  Sandbag
[15458.25s -> 15464.81s]  Adrock is so bad has adrock ever had a stat increase that was more than eight. I don't think it's ever happened
[15474.01s -> 15476.75s]  Come on, stop stop kinking my hose
[15477.47s -> 15481.31s]  Internet somebody's like going to my internet and just like kinking the hose
[15481.95s -> 15514.08s]  I love when this thing rests
[15514.84s -> 15516.84s]  It just lies on its back
[15517.56s -> 15519.56s]  Come here. Let's give you a
[15521.69s -> 15541.04s]  Some hot chocolate what the hell what the fuck
[15542.22s -> 15550.86s]  Stop this nonsense
[15550.86s -> 15556.76s]  Uh, I I apparently i'm still live
[15559.37s -> 15561.37s]  Weird. I don't know why this fucking happens, man
[15562.09s -> 15564.25s]  It really is almost like somebody steps on the wire
[15572.43s -> 15574.11s]  I should be live still
[15574.11s -> 15575.63s]  It doesn't say it's off
[15575.63s -> 15583.31s]  I think I am should still be live
[15593.05s -> 15595.13s]  Well, i'm gonna have to send another message
[15598.22s -> 15602.06s]  Because this has been happening the last like four or five streams, right? We just hit like this
[15602.62s -> 15603.58s]  patch
[15603.58s -> 15605.44s]  for like an hour
[15605.44s -> 15606.78s]  it just
[15606.78s -> 15613.39s]  Dumps on itself
[15613.39s -> 15618.70s]  Well, yeah, it's all over the place
[15626.17s -> 15628.54s]  Lively good
[15628.54s -> 15631.42s]  Uh, what about you frustrated, but you're gonna be fine
[15632.14s -> 15640.04s]  I'm not me. Wait, is it is it is it twitch servers?
[15641.08s -> 15643.08s]  Is twitch having problems today?
[15643.08s -> 15645.08s]  No, I I don't think so
[15660.76s -> 15665.35s]  Torbjorn
[15673.18s -> 15675.61s]  Yeah, you may have to refresh
[15675.61s -> 15677.77s]  Because it's kind of
[15677.77s -> 15679.37s]  This is just weird
[15679.37s -> 15683.63s]  It's as like a surge because i'm getting
[15685.05s -> 15687.37s]  I have a my cap my bitrate cap
[15688.17s -> 15690.51s]  Is that six thousand?
[15690.51s -> 15695.63s]  It's like electrically surging through my internet because like okay, so six thousand is my cap for upload
[15697.12s -> 15702.08s]  And this shit is going to like twelve fifteen thousand up like twelve thousand up
[15703.31s -> 15705.31s]  And then dumping down to like five hundred
[15705.95s -> 15712.25s]  That's weird
[15712.25s -> 15723.31s]  And like obs shouldn't even be allowing this to go past like ten thousand
[15723.71s -> 15725.71s]  Why is it a twelve thousand?
[15725.95s -> 15732.51s]  Like right now right right now. It says i'm streaming at like nine thousand up, which is
[15733.07s -> 15735.15s]  What I have a cap at six thousand here
[15736.60s -> 15745.98s]  What the hell is this doing?
[15745.98s -> 15749.05s]  That's very odd
[15749.05s -> 15754.62s]  You know, sorry, this is happening
[15754.62s -> 15756.78s]  Really is something else and all the people what's this?
[15761.13s -> 15763.95s]  Is that wit?
[15763.95s -> 15765.69s]  Huh fain?
[15765.69s -> 15767.85s]  I never thought i'd see you here. How are you doing?
[15768.75s -> 15770.73s]  Just fine and you
[15770.73s -> 15774.09s]  Me well a day hasn't passed that I didn't recall the events of that day
[15778.94s -> 15781.34s]  It won't help anything, but let me say i'm sorry
[15781.98s -> 15787.98s]  Oh, it's all right. Don't worry about it. I've eaten i've even managed to become an official breeder
[15791.45s -> 15793.45s]  Really? Congratulations. You did it
[15794.16s -> 15800.28s]  No, if you have to ask something come to the university. I work there. I'm willing to help you out if you need it
[15800.28s -> 15802.28s]  Well, I must be going bye
[15804.25s -> 15805.93s]  See a friend of yours
[15805.93s -> 15810.14s]  Something happened between you guys you're acting different than you did when you met graham and philia
[15811.31s -> 15815.87s]  Yeah, I guess although something did happen, but it's all in the past now rio. Let's go to the university later
[15818.57s -> 15820.57s]  All right. I need to
[15821.29s -> 15825.12s]  What's the end what are you gonna do?
[15827.10s -> 15828.94s]  New store
[15828.94s -> 15830.70s]  watermelon peach
[15830.70s -> 15832.70s]  beef chocolate canned fuel
[15833.98s -> 15837.44s]  solid fuel in a can
[15837.44s -> 15845.90s]  honey toast
[15845.90s -> 15847.90s]  Uh get a couple of carrots
[15854.25s -> 15856.73s]  That's such a weird number to stop at for drop frames
[15858.40s -> 15864.20s]  I'm at ten thousand even drop frames. That's very odd
[15869.71s -> 15875.73s]  Peaches mangoes watermelon, uh, how much is beef is five hundred dollars here. That's kind of a rip-off
[15889.93s -> 15891.93s]  What does the fuel do
[15892.73s -> 15894.97s]  is the fuel like the
[15895.05s -> 15897.05s]  energy drinks or energy bars
[15899.66s -> 15902.94s]  Where if I feed it to them and pumps them up, but it takes their lifespan away
[15903.50s -> 15917.61s]  Or is it better?
[15917.61s -> 15922.73s]  Hey, isn't it horrible amazing the bustle of town the incredible technology and the monsters. There's nothing like the other times
[15923.37s -> 15928.17s]  Yes, it certainly isn't like the other time so definitely in this town is anything other than the budget
[15928.81s -> 15932.49s]  Altering no, that's not something i've heard but it's certainly possible
[15933.63s -> 15935.63s]  Here improve battle ability is everything
[15936.03s -> 15940.43s]  Monsters are raised to be strong and i'll be i'm trying to do this like a times five speed apparently
[15941.68s -> 15946.08s]  It's entirely feasible that somebody has already done some experimentation in monster alteration
[15948.09s -> 15951.85s]  But that's too cruel that may be but that's the reality of this town
[15954.16s -> 15956.16s]  You'll see once you enter the competition
[15956.56s -> 15961.55s]  It's no walk in the daisies, but I don't expect a fimb of reader will have much of a chance
[15962.35s -> 15967.76s]  Thanks for the advice, but I have no choice. I've got to enter the competition and find out
[15968.64s -> 15972.89s]  Well, then first you've got to go to the association and register for the competition. Yeah
[15973.77s -> 15976.41s]  Go to the torval monster association next week
[15977.76s -> 15979.12s]  I'll mention you
[15979.12s -> 15981.52s]  Oh, don't even tell me we're gonna have to do a thing where
[15982.40s -> 15986.80s]  Titi you called master wit. Do you have visitors?
[15990.19s -> 15992.19s]  oh
[15993.07s -> 15996.27s]  It's always been celebrated what the heck are you doing in that getup?
[15996.83s -> 15998.83s]  And since when did you talk so politely?
[16000.46s -> 16002.73s]  Why you iota?
[16002.73s -> 16007.68s]  I mean shoot how very unkind of you. I happen to be very proud of master wits abilities
[16007.76s -> 16009.76s]  And that's why I became his assistant
[16010.36s -> 16012.36s]  If you're done, please get the heck
[16013.32s -> 16015.32s]  I mean kindly to cleave. Hmm
[16016.22s -> 16017.66s]  You're talking funny
[16017.66s -> 16023.32s]  Please mention us at the association don't tell me I have to go like on another one of these missions
[16023.96s -> 16025.48s]  What is this guy?
[16025.48s -> 16027.48s]  What brings you here today?
[16028.02s -> 16029.24s]  Command
[16029.24s -> 16033.28s]  He sees a very promising boy
[16033.28s -> 16037.52s]  But he's just a bit too serious if he lightened up a bit new worlds would open up for him
[16040.84s -> 16043.45s]  Come back anytime. Okay
[16043.45s -> 16045.45s]  So come back next week. What if
[16045.53s -> 16050.78s]  I'm gonna have to go to
[16050.78s -> 16052.78s]  Another one of these adventure things and do a mission
[16053.42s -> 16065.00s]  It's gonna be such a pain
[16065.00s -> 16067.00s]  Spyroid has come home from the hospital
[16072.72s -> 16084.80s]  Not dead not dead, but we got this other good shit going on here
[16090.27s -> 16092.27s]  I'll just we'll see if you can catch up
[16096.22s -> 16097.58s]  Sandbag
[16097.58s -> 16099.58s]  You can do can you do?
[16100.14s -> 16102.14s]  Life no, you can do defense
[16104.27s -> 16106.27s]  You can do target. Okay, that looks good
[16106.91s -> 16110.27s]  If we got another 20 plus increase from unprover then
[16111.84s -> 16113.84s]  I mean, nah, fuck everybody else
[16127.55s -> 16130.27s]  The intelligence stat increase I can get that to like 500
[16142.46s -> 16146.30s]  So we're probably gonna end up fusing these two together then because the stats are gonna be so much better
[16147.53s -> 16149.53s]  i'm, sorry, you're cool and all but you just
[16150.33s -> 16152.89s]  You haven't been improving as much as the unprover has
[16153.53s -> 16171.88s]  It's a weird sentence
[16171.88s -> 16173.88s]  Frustrated you'll be all right
[16173.88s -> 16181.04s]  Okay, what's coming up?
[16181.04s -> 16183.79s]  town, right
[16183.79s -> 16185.79s]  Go to the get our association
[16195.24s -> 16199.16s]  You're a femba breeder. I'm sorry, but I think it may be too difficult for you to at your level
[16199.80s -> 16201.80s]  All right, but of course you're welcome to enter
[16202.04s -> 16205.93s]  It was a pain to get into the Ruin competition, but it's easy here in Torval
[16206.81s -> 16210.09s]  Yes, you know, there's been a spike in the stray monster population in Torval
[16210.73s -> 16215.28s]  Since we have that problem on our hands. There's a hardly a time to test competition applicants
[16215.84s -> 16217.12s]  Sorry
[16217.12s -> 16220.04s]  It's not a problem. But why are all the stray monsters here?
[16220.92s -> 16222.68s]  It's a side effect of over
[16222.68s -> 16225.00s]  bearing training and machine based methods
[16225.72s -> 16229.87s]  Many monsters run away and injured monsters are often abandoned
[16230.59s -> 16234.60s]  Oh, I shouldn't talk about such gloomy matters before the competition. I'm so sorry
[16239.47s -> 16245.63s]  Uh, nothing gloomy about it. It's a fabulous story. I must say here's the asshole
[16246.51s -> 16248.68s]  Is that fain I see here?
[16250.04s -> 16254.76s]  Oh, you live in Torval. Don't you your father is a top ranking. I'm a official, right?
[16256.46s -> 16259.50s]  An elite. I'm a official. Thank you very much. Let's get it right pal
[16261.63s -> 16265.63s]  You can't be serious about entering the I'm a competition. Have you lost your marbles?
[16267.05s -> 16268.17s]  What
[16268.17s -> 16271.92s]  Oh, so sorry. Didn't mean to say that out loud to make it up to you
[16272.00s -> 16281.98s]  Why not stop by and see my fabulous ranch just look at these the latest training gadgets more than 60 monsters
[16283.31s -> 16286.35s]  If you can't take the training regimen, well, then poof you get axed
[16288.40s -> 16291.92s]  Maximum efficiency only made possible by my maximum wealth
[16292.56s -> 16295.52s]  The best ranch in ima no make that the world
[16298.28s -> 16299.40s]  axed
[16299.40s -> 16304.76s]  What do you think monsters are they're not replaceable cogs in some machine?
[16305.40s -> 16307.40s]  The best ranch you've got to be kidding
[16308.65s -> 16315.05s]  Oh for heaven's sake I know you're jealous fain, but don't get mad at me just because you lack the means to run things like me
[16316.68s -> 16322.64s]  Besides you're really only wasting your time you evil stragglers. They're not back. He got real angry real quick
[16323.04s -> 16329.93s]  They're not worth a grain of salt fain. I'm sorry

[18239.49s -> 18247.17s]  Oh, this rank is getting too easy for this monster. It needs new challenges. It could be a good time for a fresh start
[18247.81s -> 18264.24s]  Roberto hates resting. Why am I doing this to him because you have to sleep when you're tired. You don't just stand in the corner
[18264.96s -> 18271.54s]  Okay, rest
[18271.54s -> 18273.25s]  rest
[18273.25s -> 18275.52s]  sandbag
[18275.52s -> 18279.76s]  Here it is up here. This is the this is the one that matters as long as you live for the next one
[18280.08s -> 18282.08s]  One, two, three, four five six weeks
[18284.53s -> 18288.61s]  We'll be good to go and we'll finally get to a rank and that will have beat the game
[18288.69s -> 18292.21s]  But not really that's a lie. It would just you know close enough as they say
[18301.89s -> 18304.13s]  Why have I not put anybody else in tournaments for eight months?
[18305.25s -> 18306.86s]  well because
[18306.86s -> 18309.17s]  monster rancher four
[18309.25s -> 18311.25s]  Is hard to uh manage
[18311.49s -> 18313.49s]  Because I have five monsters
[18313.97s -> 18315.97s]  each monster has to do three
[18317.09s -> 18318.75s]  tournaments
[18318.75s -> 18320.75s]  each to rank up
[18320.91s -> 18327.79s]  So that's three six nine twelve fifteen tournaments to be able to be allowed to rank up to just to get to d rank
[18329.87s -> 18331.87s]  So I kind of have to pick a couple that I care about
[18332.75s -> 18336.19s]  And the other ones are just dna bait for a while while they sit on the ranch
[18340.16s -> 18342.32s]  There's a lot of it's a lot of management
[18343.54s -> 18345.94s]  And i've been told by an expert monster rancher player
[18352.98s -> 18357.38s]  Told me that uh, usually you want to have focus on one or two and the rest are just adventure bait
[18361.92s -> 18365.44s]  Somebody also told me I got one guide. It's not that hard to get to s rank
[18365.44s -> 18380.64s]  I thought somebody said somebody lied to me. Okay
[18384.66s -> 18386.34s]  You're just doing okay
[18386.34s -> 18388.34s]  Here have some food
[18388.66s -> 18396.34s]  Have a mango
[18396.98s -> 18400.56s]  How are you you're you doing? All right?
[18407.98s -> 18412.14s]  S rank is actually easier to get to than a and b rank war really
[18416.26s -> 18418.26s]  Well, i'll be at a rank
[18418.26s -> 18420.42s]  Very very soon. Hopefully he can live long enough
[18421.14s -> 18423.14s]  Is there a way that I can prolong his life?
[18423.54s -> 18425.84s]  To make it so he can do s rank
[18425.84s -> 18440.03s]  Or is he just gonna die?
[18440.03s -> 18443.81s]  Yeah freeze him
[18445.28s -> 18448.88s]  What if I just feed him nice beef every day will he live
[18456.66s -> 18458.34s]  But hold on. Wait, wait, wait
[18458.34s -> 18460.90s]  Is it true? Tell me if this is a false thing or not
[18461.78s -> 18466.50s]  If I freeze him and combine him with somebody else, he will stay at a rank. Is that true?
[18467.06s -> 18468.66s]  Was that why?
[18468.66s -> 18470.19s]  Is that for real?
[18470.19s -> 18480.40s]  The thing that comes out will be a rank. That's a half truth. Well, how does it what does that mean?
[18488.91s -> 18490.91s]  You have to combine it with another a rank
[18492.42s -> 18493.94s]  Okay
[18493.94s -> 18509.49s]  All right schedule again
[18511.22s -> 18513.22s]  You're going to what are you at? Yeah
[18514.40s -> 18516.40s]  Get that magic book
[18516.88s -> 18518.88s]  Just become unstoppable
[18519.60s -> 18524.46s]  Uh, let's do life blade
[18526.35s -> 18528.35s]  Rest. No, you don't need to rest training
[18530.45s -> 18532.45s]  What are you at? No tired fullness
[18533.25s -> 18535.17s]  um, maybe
[18535.17s -> 18536.98s]  Get on the rodeo
[18536.98s -> 18538.98s]  Let's see a little bit of a health increase
[18539.54s -> 18541.54s]  Rest and then sandbag. Okay, let's go
[18549.09s -> 18552.53s]  23 life minus three intelligence. I don't really use it at all. So it's not a big deal
[18564.03s -> 18570.46s]  I might need to buy some more food here in a minute. Thanks for the stream. Hey, thanks for coming up
[18574.18s -> 18576.32s]  Glad you like the string
[18576.32s -> 18578.62s]  Thank you
[18578.62s -> 18580.96s]  Uh, you're okay
[18580.96s -> 18582.96s]  You're okay. You can eat though
[18586.64s -> 18611.09s]  Okay, let's also praise you you're doing a great job sleepy over here you're fine
[18621.41s -> 18623.41s]  It's inevitable it's gonna happen real soon
[18623.97s -> 18627.42s]  I'm paranoid at bad death
[18633.92s -> 18638.24s]  Two things Roberto can live another year if you're lucky it should only require
[18639.28s -> 18643.36s]  It should only require only one monster to keep rank, but in four i'm not so sure
[18643.84s -> 18647.76s]  I think it's still ho it's true. I suggest not taking Roberto into the dungeon again
[18648.48s -> 18650.72s]  As he could die as soon as the dungeon ends
[18653.70s -> 18658.99s]  Definitely do we noted here
[18658.99s -> 18663.55s]  Do the book again
[18663.55s -> 18666.62s]  Then you can rest here
[18666.62s -> 18668.53s]  like blade
[18668.53s -> 18670.53s]  You're doing well. Okay tub
[18671.41s -> 18675.25s]  Yeah, I don't like the defense thing didn't really work out for you last time rest
[18683.39s -> 18685.28s]  27
[18685.28s -> 18686.50s]  17
[18686.50s -> 18700.06s]  The final dungeon is an hour long and it sucks. My monster died of old age as soon as the dungeon ended
[18703.22s -> 18706.54s]  That kind of sucks
[18707.10s -> 18725.25s]  Anybody who was hungry somebody else was hungry weren't they you're kind of hungry. What about you?
[18728.34s -> 18744.26s]  Uh, I have another beef. That's the last one I got that wasn't enough. How was I not enough food?
[18744.82s -> 18746.82s]  That was a piece of meat
[18748.42s -> 18757.01s]  Okay
[18757.01s -> 18759.95s]  Let me check their stats here
[18761.97s -> 18767.14s]  That screen is killing me. It's like being underwater and opening your eyes
[18767.86s -> 18781.98s]  He's almost at 400 intelligence
[18782.54s -> 18784.54s]  Hates mangoes
[18788.43s -> 18797.46s]  Well, that's all we got stop feeding unprover mangoes. He hates them
[18801.10s -> 18807.42s]  Well, what does he like
[18807.42s -> 18814.06s]  squid
[18814.14s -> 18817.15s]  Rest and then magic book
[18820.74s -> 18822.74s]  What no, no, no, no, no
[18834.22s -> 18836.30s]  God damn it. You have a tournament in like two days
[18836.94s -> 18851.10s]  the menus
[18851.10s -> 18855.10s]  Just click click, click, click, click, click. Sometimes you just accidentally hit the wrong button
[18860.43s -> 18865.09s]  Okay, thank god it's not today two days two weeks
[18865.09s -> 18867.65s]  Yes
[18882.62s -> 18884.62s]  Everything requires a confirmation
[18885.10s -> 18890.46s]  Feel like i'm using windows
[18890.46s -> 18894.30s]  Yes, run as administrator, please. Can I run this game as administrator and not have to do this?
[18894.94s -> 18908.96s]  All right, here we go
[18908.96s -> 18911.58s]  sleep
[18911.58s -> 18913.58s]  Rest do not do anything today at all
[18915.98s -> 18917.34s]  You can do
[18917.34s -> 18919.34s]  something how about
[18919.74s -> 18922.08s]  How about accuracy?
[18922.08s -> 18924.08s]  And you can go in front of the cannon
[18925.04s -> 18944.86s]  Whoa, what what happened? What happened plus three? What what was wrong?
[18957.47s -> 18958.99s]  mango
[18958.99s -> 18965.25s]  He doesn't hate him. Okay. Did I just give him something he doesn't like even more than a mango?
[18967.41s -> 18970.69s]  He doesn't like he likes but uh, he
[18971.81s -> 18974.18s]  He hates fucking bananas
[18978.58s -> 18989.30s]  It's ranked from top to bottom, isn't it? The stats are way too high for his rank
[18990.74s -> 18992.42s]  Well, let me just take him into the tournament
[18992.42s -> 18996.58s]  I don't want to do three garbage can tournaments to be able to prove that he's ready to go
[18997.06s -> 19011.42s]  All right, you go to tournament. Why did you buy so many mangoes? I don't know
[19012.62s -> 19016.58s]  They looked cool
[19016.58s -> 19017.86s]  All right
[19017.86s -> 19021.63s]  No, it's tomorrow not this week next week
[19022.59s -> 19024.59s]  Is the official b cup?
[19025.41s -> 19027.41s]  to move on to a
[19028.05s -> 19033.42s]  And then freeze them
[19035.66s -> 19037.66s]  Yeah, no
[19046.46s -> 19052.80s]  Some more food and high spirits
[19053.52s -> 19055.28s]  That wouldn't set up less
[19055.28s -> 19058.88s]  By the way, are you raising any mochi at the ranch?
[19059.68s -> 19061.68s]  No, no mochi at the ranch
[19061.68s -> 19063.68s]  Hmm really well then forget it
[19064.35s -> 19065.95s]  Why do you ask?
[19065.95s -> 19068.38s]  Well something is up
[19068.38s -> 19071.58s]  Recently, we've experienced these odd incidents mochi are disappearing
[19072.30s -> 19077.39s]  Okay, they walk off in the night
[19078.11s -> 19083.66s]  As if something is beckoning them a number of the customers here have lost their mochi recently
[19084.38s -> 19087.82s]  Mochi are so affectionate to humans why on earth would they run away?
[19088.62s -> 19092.35s]  Yeah, that's just it and mochi are the only kind disappearing
[19093.07s -> 19095.38s]  Have you had any problems at your ranch rio?
[19096.16s -> 19097.36s]  Hmm
[19097.36s -> 19100.32s]  No, but we don't have any mochi. So that may be why we're doing. Okay
[19102.56s -> 19106.29s]  Well, okay in that case, don't worry about it. I'll be sure to tell you if there are any updates
[19106.85s -> 19114.59s]  Yes, please do
[19114.59s -> 19118.91s]  All right. Give me give me like five give me 10 carrots
[19122.34s -> 19123.62s]  give me
[19123.62s -> 19127.57s]  three watermelons
[19127.65s -> 19129.97s]  Give me
[19129.97s -> 19133.07s]  Five beefs
[19133.07s -> 19150.02s]  And that's it
[19150.02s -> 19159.49s]  What's what is a mochi?
[19159.49s -> 19162.77s]  Week three spring cool
[19162.77s -> 19165.23s]  Uh, hello
[19165.23s -> 19167.25s]  Oh philia. Hello
[19167.25s -> 19169.01s]  Oh, who is that with you?
[19169.01s -> 19173.54s]  Oh, hey, I have regenerated ariel a new friend a mochi
[19174.82s -> 19176.82s]  It's so soft and nice to touch
[19177.55s -> 19179.70s]  Won't you try petting it?
[19179.70s -> 19181.63s]  No, thanks
[19181.63s -> 19183.87s]  When it comes to mochi fan acts strange
[19185.14s -> 19187.36s]  Just like at the restaurant
[19187.36s -> 19189.20s]  Why do you avoid mochi?
[19189.20s -> 19191.94s]  Are we eating these animals?
[19191.94s -> 19196.66s]  Am I allergic to mochi? I don't get it. You could tell, huh?
[19197.54s -> 19201.62s]  A long time ago. I had a mochi. I had no parents. So it was my only friend
[19202.86s -> 19206.54s]  I took my mochi around acting like a real breeder showing it off to everybody
[19207.44s -> 19209.92s]  And I didn't even notice how exhausted my mochi was
[19210.48s -> 19215.62s]  One time I was out with my mochi who didn't want to be out at all when we were attacked by a stray monster
[19216.43s -> 19218.43s]  My mochi weak from exhaustion
[19218.43s -> 19220.75s]  Lunged at the monster and they both fell into the sea
[19221.92s -> 19230.56s]  My mochi protected me despite my selfishness. I can't raise a mochi again. Sorry. I want to be alone for a while
[19230.80s -> 19236.37s]  I never saw him raising a mochi at school
[19237.33s -> 19239.97s]  Even though they are so popular because they are so easy to raise
[19241.54s -> 19246.45s]  Rio, I can't always be with fain to help him. Please support him as much as you can
[19248.78s -> 19260.13s]  Bye then me me support fain. Okay
[19263.89s -> 19274.13s]  So that's uh, I got more backstory now apparently let me see the stats
[19276.01s -> 19278.67s]  376 intellect he's eve rank
[19279.71s -> 19283.23s]  I don't want to uh, I really don't want to do this. I don't want to gap him
[19284.11s -> 19287.57s]  You want to see what's gonna happen with this?
[19287.65s -> 19292.30s]  They're gonna everyone's gonna forfeit every single match. It's gonna be a waste of menu pressing
[19297.01s -> 19305.33s]  Well, there's a fight tonight. This is the big one for Roberto. Do I even have to show up?
[19305.33s -> 19307.33s]  Can I just send like a piece of paper?
[19309.49s -> 19311.49s]  That says he's who's gonna come today
[19316.40s -> 19320.88s]  No, my god, man. I don't want I'm trying to press down and hit no
[19322.51s -> 19353.54s]  Uh, whatever here
[19355.06s -> 19362.99s]  Have a carrot
[19362.99s -> 19367.47s]  Why is digimon still around but monster rancher isn't um
[19368.98s -> 19371.46s]  I think it has something to do with the fact that the gimmick of this game
[19373.60s -> 19376.00s]  Really could only live a certain amount of time
[19377.50s -> 19379.58s]  The whole cd thing. What would you do now?
[19380.38s -> 19385.04s]  It'd be kind of hard to do now. You could still do discs, but I think I
[19385.76s -> 19389.92s]  Somebody mentioned I don't know where I read it, but like maybe like urls or something
[19390.72s -> 19394.18s]  For this would be like interesting maybe
[19398.11s -> 19403.49s]  QR codes. Yeah
[19403.57s -> 19405.57s]  Bar codes. Yeah, that'd be cool
[19405.81s -> 19407.81s]  But you'd also need a way to scan them
[19408.06s -> 19410.06s]  And you're talking about another game peripheral
[19410.46s -> 19414.14s]  That's probably why there was a monster rancher announcement, right on their twitter
[19415.92s -> 19418.80s]  This game really can only exist on mobile if that's the case
[19422.13s -> 19424.61s]  QR scan with your phone, right?
[19425.25s -> 19431.20s]  All right, Roberto, let's go
[19431.36s -> 19443.02s]  But yeah, there was a recent announcement from the monster rancher twitter that was like hey here we come soon
[19445.49s -> 19448.69s]  Yo, all you monster battling freaks. This is the day you've been waiting for
[19449.81s -> 19452.37s]  Win and you get a ticket to glory. You'll be rank a
[19453.25s -> 19455.09s]  Lose and you get nothing
[19455.09s -> 19458.29s]  Who will a goddess look fondly upon only one of you?
[19459.60s -> 19463.44s]  Now show us a good fight official grade rank b in trouble
[19465.44s -> 19466.64s]  Roberto
[19466.72s -> 19475.58s]  Versus depart 320 intelligence 240 defense pretty across the board. I have almost 500 power
[19476.78s -> 19482.02s]  Let's bite the floor with them to get to rank a
[19492.99s -> 19495.49s]  Bill out of the cannon
[19496.77s -> 19511.58s]  This was a skull skull doll thing see if I can get it quickly here
[19514.78s -> 19521.25s]  Good start. Oh, wow. You're nothing. This is rank b, man. You can't be fucking around now
[19521.97s -> 19537.74s]  Back to the miners. I'm keeping you from writing your lab report. I'm sorry
[19539.38s -> 19541.06s]  Go get go get that done
[19541.06s -> 19544.64s]  There's a vod though. You can watch the vod if you want if you're into it
[19549.76s -> 19552.16s]  All right, daras versus roberto
[19552.96s -> 19558.72s]  Oh high speed
[19558.72s -> 19562.30s]  Shouldn't be that concerned about it
[19564.74s -> 19571.78s]  You're putting this is b rank man. You don't quit to get to a rank
[19573.57s -> 19575.01s]  That's unbelievable
[19575.01s -> 19577.01s]  All right, uh colorn
[19580.22s -> 19581.76s]  327 health
[19589.18s -> 19590.78s]  Just high hp
[19590.78s -> 19596.61s]  It's weird. I mean hot dog things
[19597.17s -> 19600.43s]  Let's get in here and just try to get it. Let's just try to get it right now
[19601.98s -> 19603.98s]  That was risky, but it was worth it. Oh do it again
[19604.86s -> 19611.25s]  See you later. That was square
[19612.32s -> 19613.36s]  power move
[19613.36s -> 19624.35s]  It was risky
[19624.35s -> 19626.35s]  Uh bal boa
[19627.31s -> 19630.32s]  Is three, you know looks like that's the competition
[19635.38s -> 19637.38s]  Uh radicon
[19637.62s -> 19643.47s]  Pretty balanced across the board. Nothing too scary. I don't think
[19644.19s -> 19655.79s]  It's one of these robots
[19655.79s -> 19658.74s]  All right, let's see how we're gonna do this here
[19661.39s -> 19664.08s]  got it
[19664.08s -> 19668.21s]  Follow it up with just a swing check this ready power swing
[19669.89s -> 19673.38s]  Again don't counter that. Uh, oh
[19675.06s -> 19677.30s]  It's all right back it up
[19677.30s -> 19683.79s]  It's two counters. Is it god that sucks to just guess
[19690.62s -> 19694.10s]  All right
[19694.10s -> 19696.26s]  If I beat balboa, I it's a little bit stung
[19699.14s -> 19702.42s]  Even if I lose to balboa. No, he's fighting. No, this is bad
[19703.62s -> 19706.11s]  We're both four and oh
[19706.91s -> 19708.91s]  Really has to come down to this
[19711.15s -> 19713.15s]  All right
[19715.82s -> 19719.42s]  322 defense 350 power and a ton of health
[19720.74s -> 19723.92s]  slow speed
[19723.92s -> 19726.24s]  I have a lot more power, but I don't have that much defense
[19726.80s -> 19732.42s]  Let's go for it
[19736.85s -> 19739.09s]  Well, well, so you really come to fight in the competition
[19740.11s -> 19745.55s]  Oh, don't worry. I'm not interested in getting revenge for that time. You punched me. I didn't punch you my friend
[19746.51s -> 19751.47s]  Watch yourself my balboa sword fighting skills are top tip top and sharp as a knife
[19752.43s -> 19755.63s]  Who knows he might even accidentally injure your poor monster
[19757.63s -> 19770.77s]  I have the same thing. Don't I except you we have like this you guys is it made out of cakes
[19775.26s -> 19777.50s]  You this is like the candy land version of my character
[19786.45s -> 19787.89s]  Don't do that
[19787.89s -> 19793.46s]  Got it. That's a big one
[19793.62s -> 19795.62s]  Oh
[19798.67s -> 19807.36s]  You got nothing what was about what was that balboa mixed with it but like the it was almost like a
[19808.26s -> 19810.42s]  One of the slugs like the one little cake people
[19817.79s -> 19819.79s]  The goddess showed her love to roberto
[19821.09s -> 19823.09s]  He was a fairy in a robot. Okay
[19824.96s -> 19844.10s]  Congratulations. What's going on? Hope you come to your senses deal and can see that your methods were wrong
[19845.71s -> 19847.31s]  Hi, you cheated
[19847.31s -> 19850.43s]  You met with wit didn't you what did wit do for you?
[19851.39s -> 19859.02s]  Like like steroids. Yeah, you use steroids to strengthen your monsters. How awful. How could you dare say such a thing?
[19860.88s -> 19862.88s]  Shut up. So I can't accept this. I won't
[19866.32s -> 19867.68s]  What do you mean? I did
[19867.68s -> 19870.02s]  I never did steroids
[19870.02s -> 19875.22s]  And one of the other ones is on steroids. Not this one
[19876.02s -> 19878.98s]  How can we save the poor monsters on your ranch?
[19880.02s -> 19882.02s]  Darn it. What will it take to convince stale?
[19883.22s -> 19884.90s]  How about a teacher?
[19884.90s -> 19887.30s]  Maybe a teacher from the school that everybody went to
[19888.40s -> 19892.32s]  Hmm, I see but I was expelled and I don't know
[19893.78s -> 19894.74s]  No
[19894.74s -> 19896.82s]  You must not close your heart out of fear
[19897.46s -> 19899.46s]  That's the same mistake I made
[19900.59s -> 19902.59s]  You must overcome it
[19902.67s -> 19904.82s]  You're right rio
[19904.82s -> 19908.42s]  Maybe we should go to the town of visually and elvis
[19909.30s -> 19911.94s]  I can't do that. That's not gonna happen. That was really like
[19912.58s -> 19914.58s]  That was phoned in like crazy
[19918.18s -> 19920.18s]  Don't ever try to do a goofy
[19920.18s -> 19922.18s]  Because only one guy can do goofy
[19922.26s -> 19939.90s]  Roberto's two fans
[19939.90s -> 19941.90s]  What a hack performance
[19944.75s -> 19950.43s]  It was I I kind of figured I figured halfway through that that wasn't turning out of what I held the way that I thought
[19951.15s -> 19953.15s]  And I just kept going tall. Hello
[19954.03s -> 19955.31s]  Oh tall
[19955.31s -> 19956.35s]  Hi
[19956.35s -> 19960.00s]  How are your monsters doing? Shall I give feins monsters a checkup?
[19961.17s -> 19963.17s]  Well, thank you. That would be great
[19963.55s -> 19964.67s]  Let's see
[19964.67s -> 19967.09s]  How's everybody doing?
[19967.09s -> 19969.09s]  All done. None of them had any problems at all
[19970.72s -> 19973.84s]  They love you tallt you understand monster language
[19975.58s -> 19977.58s]  What made you decide to become a monster vet?
[19979.14s -> 19983.94s]  A long time ago. I had a mochi her name was mochina and she died from an injury
[19984.50s -> 19988.18s]  What's with these mochis? Everybody has a mochi apparently that tragically died
[19989.97s -> 19992.05s]  I was so sad. I couldn't do anything to help
[19993.44s -> 19996.72s]  I guess that's how it started
[19996.72s -> 19998.40s]  But isn't it hard for you?
[19998.40s -> 20001.52s]  It's your job to protect life, but you have that sad memory
[20002.59s -> 20004.59s]  I had a similar experience
[20004.59s -> 20009.31s]  Really what happened to you?
[20009.31s -> 20011.63s]  Did you write that down? That is a sad story
[20012.43s -> 20017.39s]  But I think of that experience as inspiration. I always think i've got to try hard for mochina
[20018.61s -> 20023.25s]  I figure if I don't keep working with monsters that mochina would keep would weep in heaven
[20024.34s -> 20026.34s]  She'd probably think it was her fault
[20026.34s -> 20034.00s]  I bet your mochi was happy because it cared about you enough to risk its life to protect you
[20035.52s -> 20042.18s]  Thanks tallt not at all. I'll come to do a checkup again. Bye
[20042.82s -> 20050.99s]  Okay, we now have
[20053.69s -> 20055.69s]  585 power
[20058.83s -> 20060.99s]  That is such an unbelievable number
[20061.79s -> 20063.63s]  I want it to be 600
[20063.63s -> 20072.30s]  And then we're gonna stack health a rank reverto can still he's still living
[20072.94s -> 20079.31s]  Let's do it. Let's see what the what it looks like. This is like the real league
[20082.38s -> 20084.38s]  This is the actual league
[20084.38s -> 20096.80s]  So what about the other ones? We've got
[20098.43s -> 20100.03s]  five
[20100.03s -> 20103.71s]  206 275 health you can you can slow down on the health now. He's got plenty
[20106.05s -> 20108.10s]  Maybe uh
[20108.10s -> 20110.10s]  Intellect and accuracy for a little bit
[20111.23s -> 20115.55s]  You on the other hand, let's get you to 400 intellect. No, you have to do a tournament
[20116.59s -> 20120.19s]  Everyone's just gonna quit. We just have to do a menu spam for like 10 minutes
[20120.83s -> 20127.36s]  Do this shit
[20127.36s -> 20135.36s]  tournament here
[20135.36s -> 20137.98s]  here
[20138.54s -> 20142.51s]  No here
[20143.81s -> 20149.10s]  All right
[20149.10s -> 20151.92s]  Book I have a tournament now
[20152.40s -> 20155.28s]  But I can do the book again, no, don't even just just let somebody else do it
[20156.96s -> 20159.49s]  You just rest
[20159.49s -> 20162.11s]  You do the light blade again
[20162.11s -> 20163.55s]  Sandbag. Yeah
[20163.55s -> 20165.31s]  and then rest
[20165.31s -> 20167.31s]  You can rest and you can tub
[20168.11s -> 20182.96s]  Roberto almost at almost at 600
[20183.76s -> 20189.23s]  How much more do we need?
[20189.23s -> 20192.98s]  At 602 you made it now just work on living life
[20193.70s -> 20195.70s]  a little bit extra accuracy
[20195.70s -> 20199.86s]  Okay, how's everybody doing food?
[20199.94s -> 20202.30s]  You could eat
[20203.02s -> 20204.54s]  Have a beef
[20204.54s -> 20212.64s]  Roberto can easily get s rank. I would suggest now icing two monsters and making some new ones
[20213.28s -> 20216.08s]  Some of the rank a rank fusions can be really good
[20217.04s -> 20220.10s]  Okay
[20220.10s -> 20224.42s]  So who we ice in here? I'm gonna say
[20225.22s -> 20228.61s]  I don't know what to do about this
[20235.68s -> 20239.41s]  Unprover is just I feel like he's gonna be insane
[20244.80s -> 20248.08s]  Maybe these two blossom and um ad rock
[20252.40s -> 20254.40s]  I'm gonna try to do ad rock and blossom
[20257.68s -> 20259.84s]  I forgot ad rock was a monster to be honest
[20272.51s -> 20283.41s]  Are they friends and make sure that they're friends blossom and ad rock are not really that close
[20284.21s -> 20294.90s]  We can just do it. Who cares
[20295.38s -> 20299.38s]  We're almost we're at s rank. Anyways, pretty much we just gotta beat a rank with you. You'll do it easily
[20300.02s -> 20306.82s]  Roberto's friends everybody but Roberto's still
[20307.62s -> 20309.22s]  Good
[20309.22s -> 20312.90s]  And I really don't want to have to go through every single tournament again
[20318.54s -> 20322.66s]  You can stick around
[20322.66s -> 20326.18s]  Let's do it. Let's let's head to the uh, let's head to the shrine
[20330.50s -> 20333.54s]  Spyrode and Roberto the only friendships that matter. Okay
[20336.29s -> 20344.58s]  Let's head to the shrine that was a competition today who oh right i'm prover
[20346.98s -> 20352.16s]  Visily
[20352.48s -> 20357.54s]  Uh, no, fuck that let's just go back and association and ice people
[20358.18s -> 20379.14s]  So let's see what we get it's time to retire ad rock
[20383.71s -> 20397.86s]  Goodbye what retire one of them? What do you mean frozen? Oh
[20399.62s -> 20402.11s]  Prover
[20402.43s -> 20405.79s]  Vroomer energize shroomer get rid of shroomer
[20412.98s -> 20422.98s]  What do you mean wait, wait what
[20422.98s -> 20425.41s]  If you use them, don't retire them
[20425.41s -> 20429.87s]  Don't they have to be frozen to they have to be retired to freeze them
[20432.16s -> 20434.16s]  Breeze instead of retiring
[20434.48s -> 20435.92s]  How do you freeze?
[20435.92s -> 20439.12s]  Don't you have to be retired? What are we talking about? Wait, what?
[20444.10s -> 20446.10s]  Don't you don't you have to freeze them?
[20447.81s -> 20449.81s]  You have to retire them to freeze them
[20456.03s -> 20460.11s]  You can fuse the retired ones to open up space. Yeah, but those ones don't do anything
[20465.10s -> 20467.10s]  We already tried this before we we already did this
[20468.14s -> 20472.22s]  And these combinations are don't do anything. They're terrible retiring is deleting. Yeah, I know
[20473.18s -> 20478.05s]  Yeah, I don't
[20478.13s -> 20480.13s]  I'm gonna delete shroomer. He was one of the eight
[20480.85s -> 20485.62s]  Willy Wonka mushrooms that we had I I know I know that
[20491.70s -> 20493.70s]  if I combine like
[20493.78s -> 20501.33s]  Prover and like energize i'm just gonna get another dumb useless energize bunny. Okay, like prover
[20502.62s -> 20504.58s]  and energize
[20504.58s -> 20510.35s]  Are you ready? Like it's gonna show me right? Let's see what it does. Don't use a combination item
[20512.18s -> 20515.22s]  Yeah, like mush mush tan and then gun bit
[20515.78s -> 20521.33s]  Look at these terrible stats
[20523.26s -> 20531.12s]  We've already seen mush tan it's a gun bit let's go
[20541.62s -> 20559.71s]  Just energize
[20559.71s -> 20567.79s]  That's why I was just retiring them like let's do mouse and uh rumor
[20573.17s -> 20578.05s]  No item. Yeah, we've already seen these skunk roller. Remember?
[20581.25s -> 20585.28s]  Yeah, i'm just retiring them
[20590.02s -> 20598.59s]  So we're gonna do blossom and add rock right these two are gonna be combined when he's eventually about to die
[20598.59s -> 20600.37s]  Goodbye
[20600.37s -> 20602.37s]  You also need to rank up too
[20607.12s -> 20612.13s]  That's weird. There should be more fusions unlocked, but there's not more options. It's weird
[20612.77s -> 20616.59s]  All right blossom
[20616.59s -> 20626.00s]  Goodbye. Yes
[20626.40s -> 20632.88s]  Retire who the next mouse you did mouse was the monster I got for free in the beginning of the game. Goodbye
[20633.60s -> 20645.31s]  That's the start of pokemon. Yeah
[20648.91s -> 20650.58s]  All right
[20650.58s -> 20652.58s]  Now we've got some real combos here
[20653.36s -> 20655.76s]  so blossom
[20655.76s -> 20658.13s]  And add rock
[20659.92s -> 20665.07s]  Uh, no item. Yeah, let me see what happens mum mew
[20666.19s -> 20668.43s]  Rage rock and aunt mew
[20676.46s -> 20678.70s]  Rage rock
[20679.34s -> 20683.89s]  Those stats are awful
[20697.79s -> 20699.17s]  artificial
[20699.17s -> 20700.53s]  sprite
[20700.53s -> 20702.05s]  artificial
[20702.05s -> 20704.99s]  They were both e here. Yeah
[20708.85s -> 20710.85s]  I mean, this is a rock monster
[20710.85s -> 20718.34s]  We don't have one of these
[20718.34s -> 20725.78s]  You think a rock monster would have way more like base defense. Oh, no, that's the secondary. Okay
[20730.27s -> 20732.27s]  Rage rock just is add rock
[20735.68s -> 20769.76s]  Aunt mew let's do it. The stats aren't even that good. Let's go. Fuck it. Let's see it. What the hell kill it
[20813.94s -> 20816.94s]  That's that's blueberry

[20830.21s -> 20832.21s]  Let's put a cd in see if I can get anything
[20832.61s -> 20837.30s]  from saucer
[20837.30s -> 20840.74s]  Uh, what do I have for a disc that's still just hanging out here? Let me see. I gotta grab one
[20843.07s -> 20845.07s]  Now i'm gonna freeze blueberry I will

[20866.38s -> 20869.71s]  Ed and eddie
[20869.71s -> 20871.71s]  All right, we got ed and eddie

[20873.87s -> 20876.19s]  And uh psyops the mind game conspiracy
[20877.86s -> 20881.50s]  Let's do ed and eddie first
[20892.48s -> 20896.32s]  Put it in upside down. I'm trying to get me to break my playstation 2

[20975.31s -> 20977.87s]  Take it home. Should I take away ed ed and eddie?

[21070.78s -> 21074.80s]  This is the ed boys
[21074.80s -> 21076.80s]  2d or 3d
[21077.65s -> 21079.89s]  two b's and boys
[21079.89s -> 21082.37s]  No, no, no, no, no, it's just ed boys
[21089.42s -> 21092.96s]  Can I do any more? All right, let's freeze uh blueberry
[21106.22s -> 21110.02s]  old english
[21110.02s -> 21117.74s]  That's a let me get a sip of my water. Let me get a sip of my water. Let's see the stats
[21118.38s -> 21120.94s]  Of the ed boys
[21121.10s -> 21129.98s]  It's just terrible 115 127 125
[21133.73s -> 21134.93s]  garbage
[21134.93s -> 21140.22s]  What about you?
[21140.46s -> 21144.43s]  Well, definitely gonna freeze blueberry
[21145.55s -> 21148.75s]  No, no, not the shrine
[21149.71s -> 21162.45s]  No, no, no back back back back back back
[21162.69s -> 21174.06s]  I'm putting the sopranos
[21174.30s -> 21176.24s]  blueberry
[21176.24s -> 21177.92s]  Freeze blueberry
[21177.92s -> 21187.26s]  Here's the thing though. I do have a lot of the second and third level
[21187.82s -> 21189.82s]  Uh training devices
[21189.82s -> 21192.00s]  So there is that
[21192.00s -> 21201.47s]  So it's gonna take a lot less time to get that much
[21202.35s -> 21207.09s]  stat points
[21207.09s -> 21225.04s]  Let's put in the surprise. I do want new types though
[21225.68s -> 21231.90s]  I see some people saying hey, well, those were what you froze the that one the blueberry was good
[21233.25s -> 21235.25s]  Yeah, but it was still just one of those
[21235.33s -> 21237.33s]  Little toy sack puppet things
[21237.73s -> 21239.09s]  I want something new
[21239.09s -> 21244.34s]  All right. Sopranos is gonna go in
[21246.14s -> 21284.80s]  Uh done that's it. That was quick soprano something we have not seen before
[21293.06s -> 21311.49s]  Faked it
[21312.45s -> 21316.93s]  No
[21316.93s -> 21335.47s]  No, I don't want to duck
[21335.55s -> 21360.70s]  Psyops Psyops the mind gate conspiracy use monster rancher 3. I actually don't even know what that disc is
[21362.34s -> 21365.49s]  I'm, not sure. I brought that with me to vegas
[21366.21s -> 21392.37s]  No, I didn't like it. I didn't like that game monster rancher
[21392.93s -> 21410.46s]  Going back in it was bbs the boston era. Yeah, that is back when I was in massachusetts. You're right. I've unlocked
[21411.34s -> 21414.14s]  Like eight to twelve new species
[21414.78s -> 21417.34s]  Can we get something else besides?
[21417.58s -> 21421.10s]  The sack people the ducks and the plants and the shrooms
[21423.52s -> 21425.52s]  What's the process here? All right, so this game
[21426.32s -> 21434.22s]  Any cd that has data on it has a seed what i'm doing is pulling
[21435.23s -> 21437.81s]  the seed
[21437.89s -> 21439.09s]  From the disc
[21439.09s -> 21442.85s]  And then swapping the cds because you have to and I think the game may have locked up here
[21443.33s -> 21447.81s]  It'd have to be ps2. It does not
[21452.27s -> 21488.46s]  Uh ps2 is making a lot of noise. It's trying to read. Did I like burn out my reader? Come on
[21492.22s -> 21497.39s]  Come on. What is this?
[21497.39s -> 21507.10s]  It's it's getting stuck. It's repeating itself the ps2 got
[21507.66s -> 21518.48s]  Fucking whacked. I'm gonna try something drastic here. I just opened it and closed it
[21534.83s -> 21565.92s]  Come on. Hold on
[21568.16s -> 21576.72s]  Ha ha ha ha ha
[21576.72s -> 21578.72s]  What is this an nes cartridge?
[21578.72s -> 21586.46s]  This better be good the plant. It's a windmill robot plant
[21600.02s -> 21618.90s]  Steam punk i'm not gonna get another disc
[21621.55s -> 21624.03s]  I don't want another plant guys. I've had like three of them
[21625.30s -> 21627.38s]  Hold on
[21627.38s -> 21637.87s]  How about what's this one?
[21637.87s -> 21647.79s]  You got it. No, I don't even want to I don't even put that in the tray. That's the stupid without warning game
[21648.43s -> 21654.24s]  this this is
[21660.82s -> 21662.75s]  freedom fighters
[21662.75s -> 21664.75s]  A clock tower, of course
[21664.99s -> 21670.53s]  clock tower three
[21670.53s -> 21672.53s]  Seem it. I did see him in a couple days ago
[21673.09s -> 21683.02s]  Let's get clock tower in here and whatever we get from one of these. Uh, that's it
[21683.58s -> 21691.70s]  We got freedom fighters as well
[21691.70s -> 21695.78s]  Space channel five dreamcast does not work for some reason good something about the discs
[21697.50s -> 21702.62s]  And the data and how they're coded on the cd or something because we kept getting the same monster over and over again
[21703.18s -> 21716.42s]  Okay, let's go
[21717.14s -> 21721.55s]  It's another plant
[21721.63s -> 21724.91s]  I'm just gonna win the game with s rank and just feed
[21725.87s -> 21727.39s]  Roberto
[21727.39s -> 21730.75s]  Like energy fuel every day and make sure I can get to s rank and win
[21731.39s -> 21753.78s]  No softlock this time. That's good
[21753.78s -> 21754.82s]  cats
[21754.82s -> 21784.53s]  Freedom fighters, this is it. I am making a commitment to this creature
[21785.09s -> 21794.21s]  Put in the disc for the office season two
[21798.42s -> 21805.23s]  I didn't bring very many dvds or anything with me here. All right, pray for something cool
[21805.71s -> 21812.02s]  This is pretty much our last shot. All right, close it up
[21821.57s -> 21823.57s]  aka the good season
[21823.57s -> 21828.32s]  Don't people love that show except for like the last two seasons or something
[21831.89s -> 21835.41s]  Go buy a bunch of one dollar dvds. I did do that for monster ranger 2
[21836.13s -> 21848.46s]  Well, there it is. Mr. Jello
[21848.94s -> 21859.18s]  Oh, just wuss Thanos
[21859.58s -> 21865.78s]  Looks like snow. Does somebody say it looks like snow white?
[21885.96s -> 21894.02s]  Squisher rubber cement man
[21894.02s -> 21898.35s]  Then
[21923.57s -> 21925.57s]  Slop that's it
[21925.89s -> 21929.34s]  This monster doesn't matter
[21929.34s -> 21931.81s]  Let's take a look at stats
[21931.81s -> 21934.29s]  How sad that monster looks? Okay. Here we go
[21934.85s -> 21937.17s]  slop
[21937.17s -> 21939.17s]  I'd like to wuss Thanos
[21939.25s -> 21942.32s]  But that's too like me me. I get it
[21943.47s -> 21945.47s]  Not bad base stats
[21945.63s -> 21948.83s]  That's we we put this guy on the magic book
[21951.15s -> 21953.15s]  We'll have like 800 intelligence
[21955.62s -> 21957.62s]  Here's the eds. Okay
[21959.86s -> 21961.06s]  Okay
[21961.06s -> 21970.34s]  Let's get a save
[21970.34s -> 21975.76s]  magic book no breaks
[21975.76s -> 21978.16s]  Well, we still yeah. Okay, let's get you on the book
[21978.88s -> 21981.66s]  You still have to do tournaments. We're speaking of tournaments
[21982.54s -> 21989.33s]  We've got a tournament here a rank signed up for it. This will be the first time seeing it
[21990.80s -> 21992.56s]  a rank a rank
[21992.56s -> 21994.74s]  today
[21994.82s -> 21996.82s]  You are
[21996.90s -> 22004.19s]  Let me see the schedule again rest it up
[22005.07s -> 22007.71s]  Uh, let's do training on the magic book
[22009.55s -> 22012.43s]  I want to see how what the second one on day one what your stats are like
[22013.79s -> 22025.81s]  Wait, what does it say? Oh somebody doesn't who doesn't have a schedule? Oh you okay?
[22040.19s -> 22048.67s]  Plus six on the magic book. Come on you can do better than that. You don't need anything
[22050.11s -> 22059.44s]  He puts on glasses that's so stupid
[22073.02s -> 22075.02s]  Young monsters gain less from the machines
[22075.10s -> 22078.14s]  Yeah, I probably should just have them not do any machines, right?
[22083.33s -> 22086.05s]  All right rank a seven grand salmon
[22087.01s -> 22090.45s]  Let's see what the competition is like in the second highest rank in the game
[22091.17s -> 22107.01s]  the galaxy tuck
[22107.01s -> 22109.01s]  Roberto and slim
[22109.49s -> 22115.63s]  Not that scary
[22118.10s -> 22143.66s]  Everybody's gonna die in one hit anyways, you're cool looking this power is out of control
[22145.25s -> 22147.71s]  That's just what happens
[22147.71s -> 22150.83s]  When you stack it, he's have 600 fucking power
[22156.67s -> 22158.67s]  Just keep him alive to the end of the game
[22158.91s -> 22169.60s]  300 almost 400 health
[22170.00s -> 22173.39s]  That's nothing i'll tear through you
[22182.26s -> 22193.39s]  Bomber, okay, that's fine
[22193.47s -> 22199.41s]  You don't stand a chance
[22199.41s -> 22204.72s]  kill everyone
[22206.05s -> 22213.42s]  What's championship will helm it's another one of uh, it's a sword user
[22217.26s -> 22218.80s]  350 power
[22218.80s -> 22229.52s]  You can't match my strength. I'm sorry. Oh fuck. It's the same
[22230.08s -> 22233.73s]  You're just me from another dimension
[22233.89s -> 22236.32s]  And they can only be one of us. I'm sorry
[22236.48s -> 22253.93s]  Put on
[22253.93s -> 22265.76s]  Congratulations seven thousand dollars. I mean, it's just raisin
[22267.10s -> 22270.11s]  This is raising somebody the right way
[22271.90s -> 22284.38s]  complete mid-maxing steps
[22295.71s -> 22297.95s]  Can't wait till he dies. Well, hey
[22298.91s -> 22300.94s]  easy
[22300.94s -> 22308.00s]  Okay
[22308.00s -> 22311.82s]  So let me like let me ask a question if I fuse Roberto
[22312.83s -> 22314.83s]  With somebody that's e rank
[22315.78s -> 22318.98s]  Is it just going to come out as like a shitty e rank monster?
[22331.68s -> 22337.14s]  Do not just saves come and find out
[22338.29s -> 22341.14s]  They always come out as e
[22341.14s -> 22348.42s]  Because I mean it just it just seems so counterproductive to just get three people at the same time to rank a
[22349.06s -> 22354.69s]  Let's see. I want to see what happens. I'm curious
[22363.65s -> 22365.65s]  We got to save
[22366.45s -> 22389.54s]  I'm just curious what happens. It's either they come out at the current rank or two ranks lower
[22390.18s -> 22397.22s]  Let's see combine
[22397.22s -> 22403.74s]  combine Roberto
[22405.12s -> 22407.41s]  with
[22407.41s -> 22409.41s]  Um, I don't like rumor
[22410.29s -> 22412.29s]  Prover just i'm just curious. Let's see
[22416.42s -> 22419.46s]  Who's d this is uh, somebody that's e let's see somebody that's e
[22421.44s -> 22423.12s]  no combo item
[22423.12s -> 22425.47s]  What comes out?
[22425.47s -> 22428.75s]  e two e's and they're both just awful base stats
[22429.47s -> 22432.93s]  So that's not gonna happen
[22433.01s -> 22435.01s]  Not even any stat increases at all
[22435.49s -> 22445.79s]  So what if it's d? Let's see
[22451.89s -> 22453.89s]  uh, so Roberto
[22454.29s -> 22456.29s]  and rumors d
[22456.69s -> 22459.95s]  Do I get a d monster?
[22462.24s -> 22468.10s]  No
[22468.10s -> 22470.10s]  These definitely look like they have better stats though
[22478.54s -> 22481.02s]  Better step but like okay. Here's the thing. I don't understand about this game
[22482.22s -> 22484.94s]  If it gives you a rank e monster
[22485.66s -> 22489.74s]  With stats that are that good base the higher. Okay, if you have two people at a higher rank, right?
[22490.91s -> 22492.35s]  Won't I just
[22492.35s -> 22494.51s]  One hit kill every single monster in rank e
[22495.15s -> 22497.58s]  What's the point of even doing e tournaments?
[22505.39s -> 22507.39s]  You just climb faster, but I mean that
[22508.19s -> 22515.31s]  Seems kind of redundant to do all the tournaments again at the bottom when all the monsters are gonna have like 100 stats
[22516.03s -> 22527.23s]  It's just a smurf account. That's really what it is
[22529.87s -> 22531.87s]  um, okay, well
[22533.42s -> 22540.85s]  I'm gonna bring the dra I'm gonna bring the dragon over here just to see what happens. We have it saved. So don't worry
[22546.58s -> 22549.06s]  Uh, can I retire from here? Oh fuck. Whoops
[22549.62s -> 22568.05s]  Might be able to beat the game with Roberto. Yeah, that's true. I don't I mean I could but i'm just curious what I could get
[22571.36s -> 22573.20s]  Yeah, let's retire
[22573.20s -> 22578.21s]  Spyroid and just see what happens. I want to see what it would be
[22587.54s -> 22595.60s]  He's ranked d. Uh, yeah retire somebody just i'm doing this for the sake of just checking
[22596.72s -> 22598.72s]  Uh, I get rid of like prover who cares
[22609.15s -> 22615.55s]  Okay, they're friends Roberto and
[22617.79s -> 22619.79s]  Spyroid are friends
[22620.61s -> 22623.17s]  So this should be more favorable
[22624.13s -> 22631.79s]  And no combo item just yet glacier zag
[22633.47s -> 22636.42s]  I mean this that's
[22636.42s -> 22638.66s]  191 power base. It's pretty great. But
[22641.31s -> 22645.92s]  175
[22645.94s -> 22662.00s]  Vesuvius
[22662.00s -> 22663.68s]  fire flutter
[22663.68s -> 22667.04s]  Detail d bite and this is swing charge kick and cut in two
[22669.30s -> 22670.91s]  Is this a
[22670.91s -> 22675.73s]  dragon with a sword
[22675.73s -> 22678.72s]  Let's see
[22678.72s -> 22681.36s]  Or is this a there's a dragon coated
[22682.32s -> 22683.36s]  Knight
[22683.36s -> 22685.36s]  All right. That's pretty cool
[22685.92s -> 22696.82s]  So that's a dragon knight
[22696.82s -> 22698.82s]  he's really cool, but
[22698.98s -> 22700.90s]  I have to start over again. Okay. I mean can I
[22703.58s -> 22705.06s]  let
[22705.06s -> 22709.22s]  Just wait, just wait. Wait, wait. No, no, no, no. I'm gonna get let's wait till
[22709.86s -> 22715.14s]  Let's wait till roberts is gonna die. I'm gonna bring spyroid up to like rank c or b
[22715.70s -> 22724.45s]  Let's see what the other one looks like
[22724.45s -> 22726.93s]  I'm gonna try to get to let's just wait till he's dead
[22727.89s -> 22731.17s]  I'm gonna keep leveling them both and then event we're gonna pick whichever one is the best here
[22731.81s -> 22736.72s]  No combo and I can do a combo item too. Okay, let's see what this one is
[22741.89s -> 22747.09s]  Freeze roberto now so he doesn't die. Well, the theory is that i'm gonna be saving so frequently. It's just the same thing
[22747.65s -> 22750.27s]  No, the other thing's way cooler by far
[22753.41s -> 22758.29s]  This is just a better base version of the one that I already have. All right, let's load it
[22759.70s -> 22770.00s]  That second the dragon knight was awesome. That's what we're gonna do. Let's see what combo items can I do?
[22770.00s -> 22774.86s]  No
[22775.02s -> 22781.07s]  Combo item speed stone
[22782.03s -> 22784.59s]  Defense stone int stone. All right, that's kind of cool
[22785.84s -> 22787.68s]  higher defense
[22787.68s -> 22795.98s]  Look at that defense
[22795.98s -> 22798.30s]  I'm warning i'll never have to level that up once
[22799.98s -> 22802.10s]  This is glacier
[22802.10s -> 22805.94s]  Stats aren't as nearly as good as this one though. This is like really really good to start off with
[22807.07s -> 22809.31s]  especially if they
[22809.31s -> 22813.07s]  If I get him to rank s and spyroid to rank like c or b
[22815.38s -> 22817.38s]  Glacier is the same. Yeah, it's the same one
[22819.28s -> 22821.28s]  Yeah, that's the plan. We're gonna do defense stone
[22822.22s -> 22825.90s]  And get these both to rank like c and s
[22828.80s -> 22830.32s]  Let's load the game
[22830.32s -> 22844.21s]  Can also swap the order. Yeah, you could swap the order too. Let me see that
[22845.15s -> 22847.55s]  Just in case you know, just in case let's get our bases covered
[22858.93s -> 22864.69s]  Hello fain
[22864.69s -> 22866.29s]  spyroid
[22866.29s -> 22870.13s]  And then roberto
[22871.22s -> 22874.02s]  Uh use an item just to see what it looks like
[22874.18s -> 22877.31s]  Like and we can get
[22878.43s -> 22880.43s]  Say same stuff
[22882.40s -> 22884.40s]  Same deal
[22890.54s -> 22896.46s]  All right, oh i'm just gonna turn the playstation off
[22897.42s -> 22899.74s]  I don't think can I load game from here? Probably no
[22902.30s -> 22921.25s]  All right. See you in a second
[22921.25s -> 22923.34s]  Data corrupt
[22923.34s -> 22929.49s]  That would be awful, but we're good. So for the remainder of the stream
[22930.61s -> 22932.05s]  We're gonna try to get
[22932.05s -> 22934.05s]  Roberto as high as we can before he dies
[22937.78s -> 22939.30s]  And then when he's dead
[22939.30s -> 22941.30s]  Just right before he dies
[22942.30s -> 22944.03s]  Freeze him
[22944.03s -> 22948.43s]  Make sure he was friends that he's friends enough with spyroid get spyroid to like rank c
[22949.42s -> 22953.18s]  Or b or whatever and just see how far I can get that and then fuse them together
[22970.72s -> 22974.48s]  So the question I have the people that have played this game before if I get to s rank
[22976.51s -> 22978.11s]  And he's still alive
[22978.11s -> 22983.92s]  I pretty much have beaten the game. I just have to do you win. Is there a credit sequence?
[22985.02s -> 22989.90s]  Should I not do that? Should I just fuse and just have our last child be the dragon knight and just that's cool
[22990.54s -> 22995.73s]  I'm just getting late too, isn't it?
[22997.36s -> 23001.50s]  Yes, okay. There is a final dungeon and final boss
[23002.38s -> 23005.50s]  I feel like i'm gonna need three people to be high for that though
[23011.62s -> 23014.50s]  So we got spyroid. All right. Let's just keep going. What does the calendar look like?
[23015.62s -> 23018.50s]  Roberto, uh, let's yeah, let's do this
[23019.30s -> 23021.30s]  Try to get to s rank as fast as possible
[23021.30s -> 23023.54s]  Okay
[23023.54s -> 23026.72s]  That's good
[23026.72s -> 23028.26s]  and then
[23028.26s -> 23032.75s]  Any official turn do I have to do something here to get another fresh official tournament?
[23036.98s -> 23040.58s]  Uh, you don't and I didn't as a kid. There is a credit credit sequence
[23043.60s -> 23047.09s]  Okay
[23047.09s -> 23056.62s]  The map generation could be really annoying
[23058.61s -> 23059.65s]  Well
[23059.65s -> 23061.65s]  How about that? I'm not gonna stop yet, but
[23062.93s -> 23065.81s]  We'll see how far we are in the next like 45 minutes or so
[23069.41s -> 23071.41s]  And if i'm not like close
[23073.28s -> 23075.49s]  Because let's put it this way
[23075.49s -> 23077.73s]  I'm gonna be I have mr. Mosquito
[23078.37s -> 23081.28s]  So mr. Mosquito is a game that i'm gonna be playing
[23082.08s -> 23085.15s]  and I also have um
[23085.15s -> 23087.98s]  What's shadow of rome? Let me see what we got here
[23092.22s -> 23094.22s]  Yeah, I have shadow of rome and mr. Mosquito
[23095.38s -> 23100.02s]  So maybe what we'd end up doing is just if I don't if i'm like another hour or two out
[23101.41s -> 23102.85s]  I would probably just
[23102.85s -> 23104.85s]  Cap the stream next week
[23105.79s -> 23108.22s]  After all the other stuff I want to do
[23108.30s -> 23111.82s]  With start with mr. Mosquito play through that do like shadow of rome or
[23117.42s -> 23119.86s]  And finish this
[23119.86s -> 23125.76s]  At some point during that stream or start with it and then move on to mr
[23125.76s -> 23133.33s]  Mosquito and then do shadow of rome because if i'm this close to the end then the next time I turn the playstation 2 on
[23133.33s -> 23140.61s]  I probably should finish it. So but for now, let's uh, let's just keep doing this for a little bit longer
[23143.09s -> 23144.69s]  because tomorrow
[23144.69s -> 23147.41s]  Uh, think me and italics are gonna try risk of rain 2 co-op
[23148.43s -> 23150.03s]  Seems like it's really fun
[23150.03s -> 23154.19s]  And then saturday is the secura scratch off germa slots day
[23154.75s -> 23157.63s]  So that's kind of the plan for the next few days
[23159.20s -> 23160.56s]  but
[23160.56s -> 23161.76s]  calendar
[23161.76s -> 23163.84s]  Let's see if I can win some more of these
[23164.64s -> 23167.62s]  And get to s tonight. I wonder we'll try
[23170.91s -> 23175.07s]  Uh sandbag tonight. No, you know what? You're you're so powerful already
[23176.13s -> 23178.13s]  I probably should do something else like
[23178.69s -> 23181.18s]  life
[23181.66s -> 23183.66s]  And then rest
[23184.62s -> 23187.74s]  You are the only two that really really actually matter
[23188.46s -> 23196.19s]  Did I decide on the charity yet?
[23196.35s -> 23198.99s]  No, i'm trying to have a cup narrowed down
[23199.55s -> 23203.84s]  I will tell you what the charity is
[23203.84s -> 23206.24s]  Because i'm trying to get it to like a good charity, you know
[23206.96s -> 23208.48s]  Trying to do my research
[23208.48s -> 23219.06s]  So you are fine. You can actually switch these
[23220.18s -> 23221.70s]  Do this one
[23221.70s -> 23223.70s]  No, no, no, no
[23224.10s -> 23226.40s]  Get on the rodeo. Why not and then rest?
[23226.56s -> 23235.79s]  All right, let's go it's pretty good gain
[23246.43s -> 23252.37s]  Have some more meat
[23252.53s -> 23278.14s]  He's pretty tired. That's all right. You you're fine. I can feed you. There we go
[23280.51s -> 23283.54s]  Uh
[23283.54s -> 23285.54s]  Is he sitting in a tub of himself?
[23289.31s -> 23303.31s]  He just pissed in this tub. He just made a tub around himself and peed in it weirdo. Oh, this is this tomorrow
[23308.75s -> 23310.75s]  There's a drink in there too
[23310.75s -> 23312.91s]  That is this probably still also piss
[23313.55s -> 23316.94s]  All right, rest rest
[23317.86s -> 23323.30s]  You uh, you the goofy fuck. I don't know what the hell you're gonna be doing. Um life blade maybe
[23324.26s -> 23328.02s]  Not like any of these guys really matter. It's too much to have to deal with
[23329.06s -> 23331.22s]  Take take too long. Everyone lives only a certain amount of time
[23331.94s -> 23335.20s]  I can't say I was a huge fan
[23335.60s -> 23336.64s]  of the
[23336.64s -> 23350.77s]  Three plus monsters to have on your ranch. Yeah, save it
[23360.99s -> 23362.11s]  target
[23362.11s -> 23366.91s]  Uh, you don't it's just like that. You're just not any i'm not gonna be using you anymore
[23367.39s -> 23374.11s]  And do what you need to do
[23379.42s -> 23384.62s]  Plus the re he just needs to rank up but for him to rank up I have to do three full tournaments
[23385.18s -> 23388.22s]  And then do the official tournament just to get him to rank d
[23389.10s -> 23392.00s]  I don't have time for that. I got like so many other things to have to deal with
[23400.27s -> 23404.27s]  Like Roberto's almost dead. So I got to get him as far up as I can before he dies
[23404.91s -> 23420.21s]  Okay, paz. Let's see what you got
[23420.53s -> 23434.59s]  Not even quick do a tag tournament. Yeah, I mean, okay if you got this whole thing with you have five monsters
[23435.23s -> 23440.24s]  That can be on the ranch at the same time. Why on earth would you have most of the tournaments be single tournaments?
[23440.80s -> 23448.86s]  Is that kind of counterintuitive to the how the very base of the game is supposed to be played?
[23464.08s -> 23472.53s]  Is I mean instead of it being the single tournaments of half of the tournaments that you could select were t for team
[23474.51s -> 23477.31s]  It seems like there's one tag tournament every like two or three months
[23478.72s -> 23480.72s]  They should be every other week
[23480.80s -> 23494.34s]  Because as it stands right now, it's almost like you have to focus on one or two and the other ones just kind of get left behind
[23495.14s -> 23501.68s]  Because there's not enough opportunity to rank them up when you have to do it five separate times
[23514.50s -> 23516.50s]  By the rights to monster rancher
[23517.90s -> 23520.14s]  Uh, I don't I don't have that kind of money
[23521.73s -> 23523.73s]  Counter miss that you did
[23524.21s -> 23538.67s]  Have you considered how many people in this game must fucking hate the two of you?
[23540.80s -> 23551.94s]  Because we're unbeatable
[23551.94s -> 23555.70s]  All right. Well, hold on here. He's got 420 power and 400 defense
[23556.82s -> 23575.79s]  If anybody was going to stop me it would be this kind of character right here. It's a dragon with dodge
[23580.90s -> 23586.51s]  Uh-oh
[23586.51s -> 23595.47s]  You got high defense, but I can
[23599.18s -> 23602.70s]  You scared me a little bit not very much though. Just a tiny bit
[23608.01s -> 23609.90s]  Congratulations
[23609.90s -> 23611.90s]  So for those who get played what?
[23612.54s -> 23615.50s]  How do I get the official cup to rank up to s?
[23618.61s -> 23621.81s]  Is this something else I have to do?
[23621.81s -> 23623.81s]  Is there a storyline thing that I have to progress to do it?
[23625.09s -> 23641.26s]  Another town I have to go to stop stop stop
[23643.50s -> 23646.85s]  Go to the new town. Well, let me just get
[23649.44s -> 23652.16s]  Uh, I wish like okay, so this is what i'm talking about. So you look ready
[23654.00s -> 23658.80s]  Solo solo solo solo solo solo solo solo solo solo solo team
[23660.00s -> 23665.36s]  Why wouldn't yeah if you're gonna have a game with more than one two three four five monsters that need to be raised at the same time
[23665.76s -> 23667.76s]  Why aren't half of these t?
[23667.84s -> 23672.88s]  T solo t t t why are they so far in between look at like rank e
[23674.74s -> 23675.94s]  may ready
[23675.94s -> 23677.31s]  april
[23677.31s -> 23681.39s]  April may june july august september. How many have you seen down here?
[23683.76s -> 23690.67s]  one
[23690.67s -> 23693.17s]  In six months not enough t's
[23693.81s -> 23707.47s]  Wait, so you tell me okay, but this is a group battle
[23708.35s -> 23710.98s]  Like so I can't pull anybody up here
[23718.46s -> 23720.46s]  Well, it's all good
[23721.10s -> 23727.12s]  I'm close to the end anyways
[23727.12s -> 23730.32s]  Oh, man, the devs really got to release an update for this game
[23731.12s -> 23734.64s]  Well, there's the patch
[23735.68s -> 23744.40s]  Let's let's win one more which is down here
[23745.28s -> 23747.28s]  I just have to wait till
[23747.60s -> 23749.74s]  Let's see
[23749.74s -> 23751.74s]  Look at this shit. Come on
[23751.82s -> 23755.54s]  Did you just forget to fill in the slots?
[23757.25s -> 23758.53s]  one two
[23758.53s -> 23763.17s]  Three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven like where are the tournaments?
[23764.05s -> 23775.49s]  Can I just do this by myself? I can just pull you up here. Okay, like you're gonna get destroyed. No, why can I
[23776.21s -> 23783.01s]  Roberto has to kill. Okay, Roberto has to win
[23783.81s -> 23785.81s]  This is gonna be horrible
[23785.81s -> 23791.76s]  Does it have to be three?
[23791.76s -> 23793.76s]  It's all five
[23796.37s -> 23802.35s]  It's we're gonna have to kill all five people. Do you think he can do it? I don't think he can do it
[23802.91s -> 23806.35s]  Oh my god, this is gonna be so stupid. He's not gonna build it. He's gonna run out of guts
[23806.99s -> 23813.81s]  There's no way he's gonna run out of guts not gonna be possible. I wish I could just do it alone
[23815.76s -> 23817.76s]  I can't no that's not gonna work either
[23826.27s -> 23828.99s]  Use the others as meat shields
[23830.59s -> 23837.54s]  I'm just gonna have to i'm just gonna spam the rest of this was gonna rest everyone's gonna go to sleep for like a month
[23839.06s -> 23841.06s]  Let me go here
[23841.62s -> 23867.33s]  Fuck it. Let's go
[23867.73s -> 23869.73s]  I also wish I could set up like an auto feeder
[23883.57s -> 23886.85s]  Having to hit a okay open menu open menu
[23887.81s -> 23895.79s]  Select item. I can't just like set this up like you have a schedule system
[23896.43s -> 23907.26s]  All right, let's go
[23907.26s -> 23911.74s]  Let me see that new town visily go to visily see if I can open up anything already scheduled to competition
[23911.74s -> 23914.86s]  Do you yeah what i've just I need to open up the next story thing
[23919.46s -> 23921.14s]  Uh, let's go to the school
[23921.14s -> 23923.14s]  We're gonna find out why he got expelled
[23926.61s -> 23928.61s]  Nice to see you. What brings you here?
[23928.94s -> 23931.34s]  Mrs casa, I want to talk to you about dale
[23932.14s -> 23934.54s]  You see it's very sad indeed
[23934.54s -> 23936.54s]  This is casa, please tell him what he needs to hear
[23937.66s -> 23944.22s]  That I cannot do to teach us to guide with language and to encourage learning. It's not about forcing ideas upon others
[23945.42s -> 23946.56s]  but
[23946.56s -> 23950.64s]  The only thing we can do is consult with ima about creating official rules to regulate this
[23951.68s -> 23955.84s]  But even if that is done, there will be those who break the rules like you once did. Oh
[23957.81s -> 23960.27s]  What what happened?
[23960.27s -> 23965.95s]  the ancient book the tomb of black arts that sleeps in our school library
[23966.43s -> 23970.59s]  And is rumored to contain ancient arts of monsters strengthening
[23971.68s -> 23975.76s]  Our school forbids anybody from opening the pages of this dangerous book
[23976.56s -> 23978.86s]  He broke that rule
[23978.86s -> 23981.34s]  Arts of monster strengthening. Is that true?
[23982.27s -> 23984.50s]  Why would you do that?
[23984.50s -> 23989.46s]  Exactly. We were all surprised that one the one who cared for the monsters most would do such a thing
[23991.12s -> 23997.44s]  That's why when it happened, I asked you are you covering for somebody but you insisted it was your own doing
[23999.17s -> 24000.93s]  Yes, it was
[24000.93s -> 24002.69s]  Yes, of course. I see
[24002.69s -> 24007.73s]  I shall wait then wait for the day that you have grown strong enough to tell me the whole truth of this matter
[24008.21s -> 24013.02s]  Here we go
[24013.02s -> 24014.38s]  out of the way
[24014.38s -> 24016.62s]  What's your problem get lost? I tell you
[24017.78s -> 24018.90s]  oh

[24026.21s -> 24028.21s]  Don't you have respect for your seniors?
[24028.61s -> 24032.90s]  What the heck are you doing?
[24032.90s -> 24034.42s]  I mean, uh

[24038.67s -> 24044.59s]  Huh chris why you there? What are you up to? Uh, oh, it's mr. Richter
[24046.02s -> 24048.50s]  You bet. It's mr. Richter. Are you little punks?
[24050.10s -> 24051.94s]  We're sorry
[24051.94s -> 24055.71s]  Hey, you two got what you deserved chris. I'm talking to you, too
[24057.22s -> 24063.10s]  Yes. Yes, mr. Richter. Well, i'm sorry things are crazy around here. Here's your class s license
[24063.89s -> 24069.33s]  Thanks for listening to our dumb shitty story for the last 47 straight minutes get lost
[24073.55s -> 24079.31s]  Oh boy, finally they're out of my hair to think it's just a while back. I was scolding you and your friends
[24082.94s -> 24084.94s]  Well, you seem to be doing well fain
[24085.42s -> 24089.87s]  You gotta be worried there for a while if we can learn from all of this
[24090.35s -> 24092.83s]  In any case, i'm glad I had the chance to see you again
[24093.15s -> 24098.08s]  Hope we can learn from all this in any case. I'm glad I had the chance to see you again
[24098.40s -> 24104.05s]  Hope we can learn from all this in any case. I'm glad I had the chance to see you again
[24104.05s -> 24108.06s]  Hope we can learn from all this.
[24108.06s -> 24116.23s]  In any case, I'm glad I had the chance to see you again.
[24116.23s -> 24125.67s]  Hello, what brings you here?
[24125.67s -> 24135.52s]  Oh, that's it.
[24135.52s -> 24136.36s]  You want me to do it?
[24136.36s -> 24137.18s]  Should I do it?
[24137.18s -> 24138.02s]  You want me to do this?
[24138.02s -> 24167.84s]  Should you want me to do it?
[24167.84s -> 24170.14s]  I'm putting everything on.
[24170.14s -> 24179.64s]  All right, give me my stupid quest.
[24179.64s -> 24185.55s]  What's the title of this stream?
[24185.55s -> 24188.67s]  What is the title of this stream?
[24188.67s -> 24197.20s]  The Five Horses of the Apocalypse.
[24197.20s -> 24198.96s]  That was the last second title, wasn't it?
[24198.96s -> 24200.32s]  Today's another nice day.
[24200.32s -> 24202.48s]  Oh, we have a visitor.
[24202.48s -> 24206.03s]  Hello, like always, delivery.
[24206.03s -> 24208.03s]  Oh, rank A Breeders Certificate, awesome.
[24208.03s -> 24210.35s]  Maybe it's from the battle with Deal?
[24210.35s -> 24212.65s]  Although Deal didn't admit your victory.
[24212.65s -> 24213.85s]  Rank A, that's amazing.
[24213.85s -> 24215.55s]  I didn't know you were doing so well.
[24215.55s -> 24216.79s]  Shoot, I'm a big fan.
[24216.79s -> 24220.03s]  So don't leave me out of the loop on your progress.
[24220.03s -> 24220.87s]  I'm sorry.
[24220.87s -> 24222.35s]  Thank you so much.
[24222.35s -> 24223.19s]  Don't worry about it.
[24223.19s -> 24225.74s]  Well, keep up the good work.
[24225.74s -> 24230.32s]  Can I do it now?
[24230.32s -> 24233.50s]  Fane, now you can enter the Vizli competition.
[24233.50s -> 24234.34s]  Yep.
[24234.34s -> 24235.16s]  How are things?
[24235.16s -> 24236.00s]  Anything today?
[24236.00s -> 24237.46s]  Go ahead and take a look around.
[24237.46s -> 24238.30s]  What will you do?
[24239.30s -> 24241.10s]  Do you have anything that I can do?
[24244.08s -> 24248.34s]  Anything I can praise?
[24248.34s -> 24249.18s]  Come on.
[24249.18s -> 24252.48s]  S-rank, give me those tournaments.
[24255.76s -> 24258.00s]  Team tournament, you can't do it.
[24258.00s -> 24259.06s]  All right, bingo.
[24261.27s -> 24262.25s]  Done.
[24262.25s -> 24270.32s]  And then that is gonna be the rank A competition.
[24270.32s -> 24271.74s]  Get them prepared, get them ready.
[24271.74s -> 24273.38s]  And then bingo, S-rank.
[24276.17s -> 24279.75s]  Also, let me hold on a second here.
[24279.75s -> 24286.68s]  Spyroid, and then this one.
[24286.68s -> 24288.10s]  Spyroid will be ready.
[24290.62s -> 24302.52s]  Let's go.
[24302.52s -> 24303.52s]  I don't think you're gonna beat the game
[24303.52s -> 24304.80s]  until you win the S-rank tournament,
[24304.80s -> 24310.02s]  which I don't think Roberto will live to.
[24310.02s -> 24313.90s]  Well, I at least wanna see the S-rank tournaments.
[24313.90s -> 24318.03s]  Even if I don't do it and I'm gonna end the stream.
[24318.03s -> 24319.67s]  Like I said, I will probably clean it up
[24319.67s -> 24324.67s]  on the next PlayStation 2 stream I do next week.
[24324.67s -> 24326.87s]  So this is not the end.
[24326.87s -> 24328.74s]  We will do it again.
[24328.74s -> 24329.74s]  We will clean it up.
[24337.22s -> 24338.86s]  Roberto can definitely live as long to do it
[24338.86s -> 24340.22s]  as long as you don't give him drugs
[24340.22s -> 24341.60s]  and send him in a dungeon.
[24341.64s -> 24348.27s]  Okay, let's see.
[24350.51s -> 24351.51s]  Let's go back here.
[24353.17s -> 24354.65s]  Everyone has a thing to do, right?
[24354.65s -> 24356.13s]  Sandbag, no, don't do sandbag.
[24356.13s -> 24358.21s]  You already have so much power.
[24358.21s -> 24359.67s]  I'd rather you do like life or something
[24359.67s -> 24361.39s]  just to get some more defense.
[24365.53s -> 24366.37s]  Magic book.
[24367.57s -> 24371.41s]  And you just stand on your tippy toes for a minute.
[24379.06s -> 24383.74s]  Pretty good increase for a Spyroid.
[24383.74s -> 24389.76s]  All right, you're hungry.
[24390.92s -> 24391.76s]  You love chocolate?
[24391.80s -> 24400.07s]  I got one left for you.
[24400.07s -> 24404.16s]  That's very odd.
[24404.16s -> 24405.00s]  Okay.
[24413.90s -> 24416.12s]  You're good on food.
[24416.12s -> 24418.07s]  You are all right.
[24418.07s -> 24419.31s]  You are all hungry.
[24419.31s -> 24420.27s]  What do you eat?
[24420.27s -> 24421.19s]  Let's see.
[24421.19s -> 24423.97s]  Canned fuel, yeah, of course you love canned fuel.
[24424.99s -> 24429.93s]  You're not gonna get it though.
[24429.93s -> 24433.71s]  You turned yourself into a basil lemonade.
[24433.71s -> 24436.38s]  Where, there you are.
[24436.38s -> 24437.20s]  How are you doing?
[24437.20s -> 24447.11s]  Tired?
[24452.49s -> 24453.65s]  All right, Spyroid.
[24455.82s -> 24457.42s]  I'm gonna spam X.
[24457.42s -> 24465.97s]  You think it'll work?
[24465.97s -> 24477.63s]  What the hell is this?
[24477.63s -> 24482.56s]  Yeah, I was gonna hit X.
[24482.56s -> 24484.80s]  She's speaking into a chalice.
[24484.80s -> 24486.68s]  She's talking into a cup.
[24490.60s -> 24513.80s]  All right, Spyroid, spam X the game.
[24513.80s -> 24515.12s]  Final guts.
[24549.24s -> 24550.68s]  Oh my fucking God.
[24559.96s -> 24567.20s]  Please stay the fuck down.
[24567.20s -> 24568.72s]  God, it's hard when you don't have
[24568.72s -> 24581.20s]  an overpowered character, huh?
[24581.24s -> 24583.08s]  This game would piss me off to no end.
[24588.60s -> 24596.38s]  All right, shill, burning.
[24596.38s -> 24597.62s]  Pretty good start.
[24597.62s -> 24604.85s]  And then we're gonna do counter it.
[24604.85s -> 24605.93s]  What was it?
[24605.93s -> 24606.77s]  Power?
[24622.80s -> 24626.88s]  He's been paid to throw.
[24626.88s -> 24635.29s]  Ladies and gentlemen, Spyroid wins.
[24635.29s -> 24637.33s]  A lot of health, just realizing that now.
[24652.28s -> 24659.41s]  Gambit, flip him up.
[24659.49s -> 24661.93s]  Let's go with a slowed now, that's good.
[24665.86s -> 24667.66s]  Counter, and he missed it.
[24667.66s -> 24668.50s]  Those eyes.
[24682.20s -> 24684.84s]  A ton of health, no accuracy.
[24684.84s -> 24685.68s]  Look, it doesn't matter.
[24685.68s -> 24686.76s]  We just have to get him to a higher rank
[24686.76s -> 24693.56s]  so he can be melded together.
[24693.56s -> 24702.00s]  Gotcha.
[24702.00s -> 24703.32s]  That's the eyes of somebody that didn't know
[24703.32s -> 24719.79s]  there was a math test.
[24719.79s -> 24721.03s]  That face win.
[24721.03s -> 24730.92s]  Pop quiz.
[24730.92s -> 24732.24s]  That face win, my boy.
[24740.05s -> 24741.89s]  All right, we're close.
[24741.93s -> 24743.97s]  We're so close.
[24743.97s -> 24746.52s]  We're almost there.
[24746.52s -> 24749.16s]  Not much longer.
[24749.16s -> 24751.48s]  We just have to do this one here.
[24751.48s -> 24754.00s]  Right, he's already signed up for it.
[24754.00s -> 24756.08s]  And then you have to go this way.
[24756.08s -> 24759.54s]  That official one after beating this one.
[24759.54s -> 24764.10s]  Relax, train, and we'll be fine.
[24764.10s -> 24766.30s]  Rest.
[24766.30s -> 24767.78s]  Don't rest, you don't like resting,
[24767.78s -> 24773.40s]  so what you should do instead is get on the rodeo.
[24773.40s -> 24774.76s]  Who cares what you two do?
[24792.60s -> 24795.92s]  Take some beef.
[24795.92s -> 24799.84s]  Crunchy.
[24799.84s -> 24803.94s]  Don't feed him a bone.
[24803.94s -> 24807.81s]  And who else wants to eat food?
[24807.81s -> 24809.33s]  You, what do you want, a tomato?
[24809.33s -> 24810.81s]  Whatever it is, what is it?
[24810.81s -> 24811.97s]  Vitamin.
[24811.97s -> 24814.68s]  Take a vitamin.
[24814.68s -> 24816.20s]  Let's load you up with drugs.
[24826.70s -> 24838.53s]  You can have a nice fresh salmon.
[24838.53s -> 24841.01s]  Is Unproved doing good or is he still lame?
[24841.01s -> 24843.65s]  I mean, he's good, but I just don't have the time
[24843.65s -> 24845.01s]  to really care about it.
[24846.01s -> 24850.75s]  Roberto's dying, so we need to focus on Roberto completely.
[24855.53s -> 24862.04s]  Save it, this is gonna get risky.
[24862.04s -> 24877.41s]  Okay, we have two tournaments here, coming up.
[24877.41s -> 24879.88s]  You, rest, you.
[24879.88s -> 24881.88s]  It don't matter.
[24881.88s -> 24886.08s]  Rest, you hit the book, and you punch a sandbag
[24886.08s -> 24892.64s]  for a little while.
[24892.64s -> 24904.60s]  I remember to save, yeah.
[24908.17s -> 24910.13s]  You got a tournament.
[24910.13s -> 24911.21s]  You, everyone's fine.
[24915.42s -> 24916.46s]  All right, Spyroid.
[24922.95s -> 24926.76s]  The fresh green cup.
[24926.76s -> 24928.36s]  Sounds tasty.
[24928.36s -> 24941.86s]  Sounds healthy.
[24941.86s -> 24943.86s]  Don't put Spyro on the rodeo, it lowers his intelligence.
[24943.86s -> 24947.34s]  Well, we're not gonna even get him close to rank B.
[24947.34s -> 24948.58s]  If I can get him to C, I'll be happy,
[24948.58s -> 24950.88s]  because then I can fuse him.
[24950.88s -> 24952.60s]  This is all just to get a better stat
[24952.60s -> 24967.91s]  when I combine the both of them eventually here.
[24967.91s -> 24977.24s]  Whip.
[24977.24s -> 24979.72s]  Rank A or bust, baby, speed run.
[24979.72s -> 24984.72s]  I don't even, I don't know if that's gonna get there tonight.
[24985.48s -> 25000.03s]  Next time I play it, I will.
[25000.03s -> 25003.55s]  You, D.
[25003.55s -> 25015.98s]  Why does she have a disc floating in front of her?
[25015.98s -> 25023.59s]  Final guts, yeah, sure, I'll do it again.
[25023.59s -> 25032.52s]  Fuck that, can't break.
[25032.52s -> 25034.65s]  How does that hurt you?
[25034.65s -> 25039.14s]  What?
[25039.14s -> 25040.62s]  You just jump around in a circle,
[25040.62s -> 25043.14s]  and it did more damage than punching me.
[25043.14s -> 25050.24s]  All right.
[25050.24s -> 25054.71s]  Jesus Christ, what the hell was that?
[25054.75s -> 25057.11s]  Oh my God.
[25057.11s -> 25061.32s]  No, stop, go closer in.
[25061.32s -> 25063.12s]  Hit this.
[25063.12s -> 25082.05s]  Oh my God, don't even make me jump.
[25082.05s -> 25082.89s]  I gotta stay back.
[25088.03s -> 25092.75s]  I can't, I couldn't counter it in time.
[25092.75s -> 25097.88s]  Seriously, why?
[25097.88s -> 25108.35s]  It's over, I have one HP.
[25108.35s -> 25114.84s]  I have to block whatever it is.
[25114.84s -> 25118.16s]  We both have one health, except you unfairly got yours.
[25118.16s -> 25121.60s]  Do it.
[25121.60s -> 25138.14s]  Give me a fucking break.
[25138.18s -> 25141.90s]  It's just a load of absolute bullshit.
[25141.90s -> 25144.62s]  It's just bullshit, that's really all it is.
[25144.62s -> 25146.18s]  It's just total bullshit.
[25151.18s -> 25167.10s]  It's just so many of the games mechanics fighting against me.
[25167.10s -> 25170.72s]  Oh, I killed you in one hit.
[25170.72s -> 25171.56s]  Oh my God.
[25176.48s -> 25178.52s]  I think I lose.
[25178.52s -> 25180.08s]  No, I win.
[25180.08s -> 25194.98s]  I still won the tournament.
[25194.98s -> 25198.74s]  Does UD accidentally beat me with,
[25198.74s -> 25206.47s]  she rolled a one five to 10 times in a row.
[25206.51s -> 25212.17s]  No, by the way, this is like a 40 sided die.
[25212.17s -> 25219.60s]  I accidentally lost to that character.
[25219.60s -> 25222.84s]  Let's go to the calendar.
[25222.84s -> 25224.30s]  There it is.
[25224.30s -> 25225.14s]  Rank up.
[25226.82s -> 25230.65s]  And then this is almost time to rank up.
[25230.65s -> 25235.03s]  I'm so sick of it, I'm so sick of that.
[25235.03s -> 25237.43s]  Okay, rest, you actually rest here.
[25239.16s -> 25242.00s]  No more, no, no sandbag.
[25242.00s -> 25253.68s]  I want life blade, more life, more.
[25253.68s -> 25256.08s]  Did I get bit by a bug?
[25256.08s -> 25257.36s]  I feel like an itchy arm.
[25264.70s -> 25268.18s]  Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm,
[25268.18s -> 25274.38s]  hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
[25274.38s -> 25275.54s]  No, sorry.
[25275.54s -> 25279.64s]  Mosquitoes out today?
[25279.64s -> 25285.12s]  That means you're gonna get money soon.
[25285.12s -> 25296.18s]  Are you sure I didn't just get bit by a fly?
[25296.18s -> 25298.18s]  Oh, I absolutely loved it.
[25309.11s -> 25311.99s]  You haven't been singing in your guay voice lately
[25311.99s -> 25313.47s]  and it makes me sad.
[25313.47s -> 25316.87s]  Guay, guay, what is guay?
[25316.87s -> 25319.15s]  I haven't been singing in my guay voice?
[25334.23s -> 25339.24s]  All right, spiroid, no one's got anything.
[25339.24s -> 25341.72s]  This is tomorrow.
[25341.72s -> 25342.96s]  And then we're close.
[25342.96s -> 25344.44s]  We're close, we're close, we're close, we're close,
[25344.44s -> 25345.44s]  we're really close.
[25346.57s -> 25349.18s]  The throat noise?
[25349.18s -> 25350.66s]  Bleh, bleh.
[25350.66s -> 25351.74s]  That, like what?
[25361.28s -> 25362.76s]  Guay, guay, guay, guay.
[25362.76s -> 25364.12s]  Oh, I know what you're talking about.
[25364.12s -> 25367.72s]  Like, guay, guay, guay, guay, guay, guay, guay, guay,
[25367.72s -> 25372.52s]  I know what you mean.
[25372.52s -> 25374.12s]  Guay, okay, let's see.
[25383.16s -> 25384.80s]  Stream saved, he did it.
[25392.75s -> 25394.99s]  What sort of genetic lottery did Roberto win
[25394.99s -> 25396.79s]  to be born such a killing machine?
[25398.52s -> 25400.76s]  It's scientifically proven that Skrillex's song
[25400.76s -> 25403.28s]  Scary Ghosts and Sprites causes mosquitoes
[25403.28s -> 25405.52s]  to stay away and stop having sex.
[25409.19s -> 25412.11s]  Just like blast it.
[25412.11s -> 25413.31s]  We should have a day.
[25415.36s -> 25416.92s]  Where's the legislature?
[25416.92s -> 25422.08s]  If that's true, seriously, if that's true,
[25422.08s -> 25426.58s]  then have a day dedicated to everywhere on earth.
[25426.58s -> 25429.42s]  You put, you have to legally put a pair of speakers
[25429.42s -> 25434.55s]  out your window and blast that song as loud as it can go.
[25434.55s -> 25437.03s]  If that's true, then no mosquitoes
[25437.03s -> 25440.00s]  will ever come back ever again.
[25440.00s -> 25452.64s]  Why don't we blast it everywhere?
[25452.64s -> 25455.16s]  And then they'll never have any offspring
[25458.31s -> 25466.67s]  and mosquitoes will go extinct.
[25466.67s -> 25473.96s]  It confuses them.
[25473.96s -> 25477.43s]  Light blade, fresh.
[25477.43s -> 25478.91s]  This looks good to me.
[25488.64s -> 25490.52s]  Where's the rock version of this song?
[25490.52s -> 25491.36s]  The metal one.
[25495.48s -> 25511.93s]  There's a rock music song in this one.
[25511.93s -> 25516.58s]  All right, this is the last tournament here before
[25516.58s -> 25517.62s]  I can do the official one.
[25517.62s -> 25520.46s]  And then I'm probably gonna have to call it after this
[25520.46s -> 25522.26s]  because it gets getting late.
[25522.26s -> 25524.54s]  I'm going for more than seven hours now.
[25524.54s -> 25526.30s]  Streaming tomorrow too.
[25526.30s -> 25536.67s]  So I do need to kind of get some rest.
[25536.67s -> 25540.58s]  It really is a goblet, isn't it?
[25540.58s -> 25543.62s]  South Thirl versus Roberto.
[25543.62s -> 25546.34s]  Do I have a new, that's high, 468 health.
[25547.82s -> 25551.76s]  Get out of here.
[25551.76s -> 25553.92s]  When's the stream gonna start?
[25553.92s -> 25559.82s]  Um, I don't know.
[25559.82s -> 25562.20s]  Essentially, probably in the same time
[25562.20s -> 25569.51s]  between like it always is, between three and four.
[25569.51s -> 25575.20s]  Good start.
[25575.20s -> 25581.00s]  Then go.
[25581.00s -> 25586.66s]  Yeah, I mean, I don't see why it wouldn't.
[25586.66s -> 25587.50s]  This'll be quick though.
[25587.50s -> 25591.04s]  I like when they just get it over with.
[25591.04s -> 25594.18s]  It looks better this way.
[25594.18s -> 25595.74s]  Blue versus Lily.
[25601.00s -> 25605.41s]  Moody.
[25605.41s -> 25606.93s]  This is versus Jinx.
[25609.44s -> 25614.64s]  High 300s.
[25614.64s -> 25615.80s]  Roberto is not dead yet.
[25615.80s -> 25620.88s]  No, Roberto's still alive.
[25620.88s -> 25623.37s]  Whoa.
[25623.37s -> 25624.33s]  Robo Bird?
[25633.35s -> 25634.19s]  Sit down.
[25637.08s -> 25649.90s]  It's so much easier when you have a Roberto.
[25649.90s -> 25654.26s]  All right, Moody.
[25654.26s -> 25656.80s]  You know, nothing special.
[25656.80s -> 25668.48s]  Just getting lucky I think.
[25668.48s -> 25681.12s]  Just one of these little bird things.
[25681.12s -> 25682.68s]  Take me to Asteroid.
[25682.68s -> 25683.52s]  Just let me see.
[25683.52s -> 25684.36s]  Get me there.
[25684.48s -> 25692.75s]  It's pretty much done deal at this point.
[25692.75s -> 25694.55s]  Is this even fun anymore?
[25697.39s -> 25698.55s]  Yeah.
[25698.55s -> 25702.48s]  Yes, because I'm gonna get to see S rank.
[25702.48s -> 25704.96s]  Highest we got in Monster Rancher 2
[25704.96s -> 25706.92s]  was I think B is the highest I got to.
[25706.92s -> 25709.28s]  And that was hard.
[25709.28s -> 25715.80s]  I'm just steamrolling people.
[25715.80s -> 25726.44s]  Monster Rancher 2 was hard.
[25726.44s -> 25727.88s]  Jerma's spending hours and hours here
[25727.88s -> 25729.28s]  just to see the letter S.
[25730.56s -> 25732.00s]  Well, that's not wrong.
[25737.18s -> 25739.54s]  Okay, so then this is, oh, come on, really?
[25740.54s -> 25742.62s]  This is what I'm talking about.
[25742.62s -> 25744.94s]  Now you tell me, I got another monster
[25744.94s -> 25748.50s]  that needs to do a ranking and I have to wait.
[25748.50s -> 25749.34s]  Just look at this.
[25749.34s -> 25750.42s]  I want you to just pay attention here
[25750.42s -> 25752.74s]  because this is why, what the fuck, right?
[25752.74s -> 25755.20s]  What the hell?
[25755.20s -> 25756.97s]  Official tournament.
[25756.97s -> 25761.01s]  August, September, October is the next official tournament
[25761.01s -> 25769.98s]  to rank one of these monsters up.
[25769.98s -> 25771.10s]  I don't like that.
[25771.10s -> 25772.62s]  What's going on with that?
[25772.62s -> 25786.98s]  What the hell?
[25786.98s -> 25791.73s]  Might as well just burn it up and just get there.
[25791.73s -> 25794.41s]  And I wanna do one match in S to see what it's like.
[25801.49s -> 25803.65s]  You did put it all on Roberto.
[25803.65s -> 25807.08s]  I did, but that seems so spread out
[25807.08s -> 25810.96s]  for having this many monsters on the ranch.
[25810.96s -> 25812.64s]  You can't have more than one official tournament
[25812.64s -> 25814.44s]  in six months, four months.
[25824.79s -> 25827.03s]  I know I don't have to have more than one monster,
[25827.03s -> 25827.95s]  but that's like fun.
[25827.95s -> 25834.56s]  It's a cool mechanic and I would like to enjoy it.
[25834.56s -> 25836.22s]  All right.
[25836.22s -> 25840.20s]  Rest is the last thing I'll be able to do
[25840.20s -> 25841.20s]  before this official tournament.
[25841.20s -> 25845.89s]  Let's do, let's do accuracy.
[25845.89s -> 25846.89s]  We haven't done it in a while.
[25846.89s -> 25848.77s]  Might as well just get it up a little bit more.
[25851.42s -> 25852.26s]  All right, let's go.
[25852.26s -> 25862.40s]  Let's see it.
[25862.40s -> 25863.48s]  They don't wanna do official tournaments
[25863.48s -> 25875.75s]  when they know you're just gonna come in and win anyways.
[25875.75s -> 25878.86s]  I've just been giving him pills.
[25878.86s -> 25881.34s]  Just freeze, slough already.
[25891.63s -> 25896.90s]  Where's the Roberto will win coffee pasta?
[25896.94s -> 25901.05s]  It's funny how that was like a little meme two days ago,
[25901.05s -> 25902.49s]  but it's actually true.
[25906.13s -> 25907.69s]  I mean, that's true.
[25907.69s -> 25909.21s]  It is, almost there.
[25929.14s -> 25931.14s]  He doesn't even need a coffee pasta.
[25931.14s -> 25932.26s]  Coffee pasta.
[25934.80s -> 25938.20s]  Target practice, and there's the tournament.
[25938.20s -> 25940.92s]  Life blade, rest, you need to be fed.
[25940.92s -> 25941.76s]  You don't even have anything.
[25941.76s -> 25943.60s]  It's just automatic for like technique.
[25960.68s -> 25970.80s]  People are gonna start to get banned.
[25970.80s -> 25972.40s]  Here comes a R9K.
[25981.24s -> 25984.10s]  You did this.
[25984.10s -> 25985.50s]  Why would you want a potato?
[25985.50s -> 26005.60s]  Fair enough, just eat it.
[26005.60s -> 26007.04s]  Roberto's gonna die in 30 minutes.
[26007.04s -> 26010.34s]  Might as well spam it while we can.
[26010.34s -> 26011.34s]  I don't think he will.
[26011.34s -> 26012.98s]  I think he's gonna be around for a lot longer
[26012.98s -> 26022.90s]  than you think.
[26022.90s -> 26029.52s]  I think he's gonna be just fine.
[26029.52s -> 26038.78s]  All right, tournament time.
[26038.78s -> 26044.40s]  Beautiful life increase by Spyroid.
[26044.40s -> 26051.12s]  Official rank A tournament.
[26051.12s -> 26052.08s]  Give me some food.
[26054.32s -> 26059.32s]  Carrot, please stop.
[26059.32s -> 26070.81s]  My laptop is heating up and it's burning my legs.
[26070.81s -> 26080.45s]  This is it.
[26080.45s -> 26085.64s]  Official league grade A.
[26085.64s -> 26090.60s]  The final barrier to rank S.
[26090.60s -> 26092.28s]  Nash versus Roberto.
[26092.28s -> 26093.60s]  Let's see, who at the top?
[26093.60s -> 26095.68s]  What's the cream of the crop here?
[26095.68s -> 26097.46s]  Easy.
[26097.46s -> 26098.50s]  I feel like Roberto is,
[26098.50s -> 26101.14s]  I feel like Roberto's not supposed to be still alive.
[26124.93s -> 26128.25s]  There's no reason for,
[26128.81s -> 26130.49s]  I think Roberto's supposed to be dead.
[26130.49s -> 26141.76s]  He's just one hit killing everybody still.
[26141.76s -> 26143.28s]  He's not supposed to be alive still.
[26143.28s -> 26151.55s]  He's unkillable.
[26151.55s -> 26152.99s]  He could live another year.
[26153.83s -> 26157.19s]  Am I just gonna steamroll S and just beat the game tonight?
[26157.19s -> 26159.15s]  Is that, that might happen.
[26159.15s -> 26160.31s]  Who cares about the other monsters?
[26160.31s -> 26166.43s]  Let's just win.
[26166.43s -> 26168.58s]  I'm just gonna kill everybody.
[26168.58s -> 26171.67s]  This is view.
[26171.67s -> 26190.62s]  Like 300s.
[26190.62s -> 26193.74s]  All right, all right, go cocky.
[26193.74s -> 26195.62s]  Uh-oh, all right, don't get cocky.
[26195.62s -> 26197.26s]  Still very possible to lose.
[26197.26s -> 26210.66s]  Very possible now.
[26210.66s -> 26214.26s]  I'm gonna hold back.
[26214.26s -> 26215.10s]  No.
[26218.06s -> 26218.90s]  Uh-oh.
[26218.90s -> 26220.06s]  All right, easy.
[26220.06s -> 26221.66s]  That was so many guts damages.
[26221.66s -> 26225.02s]  Whoa, boy.
[26225.02s -> 26226.06s]  I gotta counter this.
[26226.06s -> 26228.38s]  Oh, you motherfucker gave me a break.
[26228.38s -> 26230.15s]  He's gonna lose.
[26230.15s -> 26230.99s]  No, he's not.
[26230.99s -> 26233.05s]  Hit it.
[26233.05s -> 26236.31s]  Oh, not good.
[26236.31s -> 26237.55s]  Yes.
[26237.55s -> 26256.28s]  I fucking hate this game.
[26256.28s -> 26266.74s]  Are you gonna die?
[26266.74s -> 26270.87s]  God, why?
[26270.87s -> 26273.75s]  I almost got killed by the troll doll.
[26273.75s -> 26274.99s]  All right, sunset.
[26276.89s -> 26277.73s]  Look at those stats.
[26277.73s -> 26278.57s]  And then I was down.
[26278.57s -> 26280.33s]  Look at how bad the speed and intelligence is.
[26280.33s -> 26283.11s]  Wow, I really am.
[26283.11s -> 26285.40s]  Like the last cannon.
[26285.40s -> 26303.05s]  Sunset.
[26303.05s -> 26309.49s]  Wow, that was fast.
[26309.49s -> 26319.06s]  Get in there.
[26319.06s -> 26321.16s]  Like that.
[26321.16s -> 26323.78s]  Back it up.
[26326.20s -> 26342.73s]  Don't blow the guts here.
[26342.73s -> 26345.09s]  Three no.
[26345.09s -> 26348.21s]  All right, Sun Louise.
[26348.21s -> 26352.08s]  There are, I'm still undefeated.
[26352.08s -> 26353.28s]  Three people here are undefeated.
[26353.28s -> 26355.36s]  Let's see what happens here.
[26355.36s -> 26356.20s]  All right, this is gonna be tricky
[26356.20s -> 26359.85s]  because three and oh, the top three.
[26360.65s -> 26362.93s]  I'm gonna get RNG'd somehow.
[26362.93s -> 26363.77s]  I know it.
[26363.77s -> 26365.01s]  Sun Louise.
[26366.05s -> 26367.13s]  Why are you so good?
[26367.13s -> 26367.97s]  You aren't.
[26367.97s -> 26370.60s]  It's probably your move set.
[26370.60s -> 26373.00s]  Tail sting, smoke bomb.
[26373.00s -> 26376.93s]  Whole lot of bullshit.
[26376.93s -> 26377.97s]  Let the AI control it?
[26377.97s -> 26379.36s]  No.
[26379.36s -> 26384.94s]  The AI is so dumb.
[26384.94s -> 26393.79s]  That's cool looking though.
[26393.79s -> 26394.95s]  Clean it up right now.
[26396.60s -> 26398.40s]  That's a good combo.
[26398.40s -> 26407.24s]  Just gotta connect, that's it.
[26407.24s -> 26411.24s]  Okay, Spartacus or Spartix.
[26411.24s -> 26415.65s]  Spartax.
[26415.65s -> 26418.33s]  Spartax versus, okay, Spartax loses here
[26418.33s -> 26421.12s]  and that's a good game.
[26421.12s -> 26424.80s]  Ooh, who won?
[26424.80s -> 26425.64s]  No.
[26425.64s -> 26433.27s]  All right, Spartax is really the only thing in the way.
[26433.27s -> 26435.51s]  Four and oh versus four and oh.
[26435.51s -> 26437.40s]  Comes down to this.
[26437.40s -> 26439.92s]  Huge accuracy.
[26439.92s -> 26450.40s]  But I just gotta land, just gotta land the attacks.
[26450.40s -> 26451.92s]  Oh, you two came to Visley too.
[26451.92s -> 26454.56s]  I had some important business here so I dropped by.
[26454.56s -> 26456.88s]  Picked a stop at a C to enjoy the competition
[26456.88s -> 26458.68s]  near the old school.
[26458.68s -> 26460.96s]  With rank A opponents, my Spartax should get
[26460.96s -> 26461.92s]  some good exercise.
[26461.92s -> 26465.70s]  What, you just came and joined the tournament?
[26465.70s -> 26467.78s]  You would just go into the grocery store
[26467.78s -> 26469.86s]  and you just have to stop and join mid-tournament
[26469.86s -> 26470.70s]  at the end?
[26470.70s -> 26475.54s]  What are you talking about?
[26475.54s -> 26477.96s]  What a humble brag.
[26477.96s -> 26480.24s]  Oh, you know, I was just like on the way to the store
[26480.24s -> 26483.04s]  and I would enter the highest capable quality tournament
[26483.04s -> 26503.34s]  in the world.
[26503.34s -> 26504.18s]  Lock it.
[26504.18s -> 26508.66s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[26511.19s -> 26516.04s]  Bad.
[26516.04s -> 26517.56s]  Come on, come on, one more, one more.
[26517.56s -> 26518.40s]  Do it right now.
[26518.40s -> 26519.24s]  Double tap him right here.
[26519.24s -> 26522.44s]  No!
[26540.76s -> 26544.48s]  Fuck, this stupid game mechanic.
[26544.48s -> 26548.96s]  Where you just have to guess what move they're gonna do.
[26548.96s -> 26550.12s]  Like, what the hell?
[26550.12s -> 26554.22s]  I have to do this whole tournament again.
[26554.22s -> 26556.86s]  Like, why would that be in the game?
[26559.29s -> 26563.75s]  Just a one out of three chance to not get hit by a move.
[26565.30s -> 26570.30s]  Oh, come on, it really is rock, paper, scissors
[26570.30s -> 26572.10s]  at the highest competitive level.
[26581.35s -> 26592.33s]  This is rock, paper, scissors at the Olympics.
[26592.33s -> 26593.29s]  Did I save before?
[26593.29s -> 26595.01s]  I don't wanna do that again.
[26595.01s -> 26598.14s]  Did I save right before that?
[26598.14s -> 26599.62s]  Was it right before that happened?
[26599.62s -> 26607.48s]  God damn it, I don't, I hate that.
[26607.48s -> 26609.14s]  God.
[26611.06s -> 26627.43s]  I don't know.
[26627.43s -> 26630.03s]  No, but I need to get to S rank and then I'm gonna.
[26633.86s -> 26636.00s]  Ugh.
[26636.00s -> 26637.16s]  Yeah, it is today.
[26637.16s -> 26638.32s]  All right, what can I do differently?
[26638.32s -> 26639.16s]  How about this?
[26641.08s -> 26647.31s]  What if I just go, come on, just.
[26647.31s -> 26648.63s]  Here comes choke two.
[26648.63s -> 26650.11s]  No, I'm not gonna choke again.
[26650.11s -> 26654.49s]  It's not even choke.
[26654.49s -> 26656.65s]  It's just fucking whipping dice in the air.
[26658.70s -> 26661.34s]  All right, I'm gonna give the best food I can.
[26661.34s -> 26662.58s]  Why do they all want potatoes?
[26662.58s -> 26664.22s]  Get a watermelon.
[26664.22s -> 26671.48s]  Nutrients, focus.
[26671.48s -> 26675.32s]  Lively, completely focused and not tired at all.
[26675.32s -> 26689.50s]  Let's go.
[26689.50s -> 26690.82s]  Where's a good place to start the franchise?
[26690.82s -> 26691.66s]  What do you think is the best?
[26691.66s -> 26695.81s]  Monster Rancher 2 is absolutely the best start
[26695.81s -> 26698.76s]  and it's probably the best game.
[26698.76s -> 26701.32s]  You could probably just do Monster Rancher 2
[26701.32s -> 26704.44s]  and not any of the others, if I'm completely honest.
[26704.44s -> 26705.80s]  Or maybe the DS one.
[26705.80s -> 26722.04s]  I have not tried the DS one.
[26722.04s -> 26722.88s]  This one's all right.
[26722.88s -> 26723.70s]  No, this one's good.
[26723.70s -> 26724.54s]  I like two more than four.
[26724.54s -> 26727.53s]  Yeah, I do.
[26727.53s -> 26728.97s]  I do like, I mean, I wouldn't play this one
[26728.97s -> 26733.44s]  for like 30 hours if I didn't like it.
[26733.44s -> 26737.30s]  I do think two is a better game though.
[26737.30s -> 26757.20s]  I like two's mechanics a little more.
[26757.20s -> 26758.04s]  All right, stay down.
[26758.04s -> 26765.55s]  Let's go.
[26765.55s -> 26768.31s]  You draw to make monsters in Monster Rancher DS?
[26768.31s -> 26780.02s]  That's cool.
[26780.02s -> 26783.81s]  So we're in the same timeline though, right?
[26783.81s -> 26803.92s]  Does that mean that he'll do the same exact moves?
[26803.92s -> 26806.44s]  I can't lose right now.
[26806.44s -> 26807.48s]  Block it.
[26807.48s -> 26830.09s]  Oh my God.
[26830.09s -> 26832.90s]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[26832.90s -> 26834.02s]  Ha ha ha.
[26834.02s -> 26836.83s]  Ha ha ha ha.
[26836.83s -> 26838.11s]  I can still do it.
[26838.11s -> 26842.61s]  I can still do it.
[26842.61s -> 26843.73s]  I can still do it.
[26843.73s -> 26867.06s]  I just can't lose another one.
[26867.06s -> 26867.90s]  I didn't even try.
[26867.90s -> 26868.72s]  Okay, fine.
[26868.72s -> 26869.56s]  I'm fine.
[26869.64s -> 26874.98s]  I'm fine.
[26874.98s -> 26878.43s]  Spartacus is the only one that's not,
[26878.43s -> 26881.89s]  that doesn't have a loss.
[26881.89s -> 26884.78s]  I just gotta get there.
[26884.78s -> 26886.18s]  Oh my God, I almost lost.
[26886.18s -> 26889.82s]  Ha ha ha.
[26889.82s -> 26890.86s]  How did I almost lose?
[26890.86s -> 26892.54s]  I thought the past was already written.
[26892.54s -> 26897.00s]  The ink is dry.
[26897.00s -> 26923.18s]  I thought that's what the case was.
[26923.18s -> 26924.89s]  Things are looking up.
[26924.89s -> 26926.61s]  I mean, the past is already written.
[26926.61s -> 26948.93s]  The ink is dry, but I can do it.
[26948.93s -> 26954.74s]  All right, Spartacus versus Roberto, go.
[26954.74s -> 26956.78s]  Win this match and I win the tournament
[26956.78s -> 26960.60s]  and I don't have to do this bullshit again.
[26960.60s -> 26962.32s]  Oh, yeah, all right, out of the way of the store.
[26962.32s -> 26963.24s]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[26963.24s -> 26964.52s]  Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[26964.52s -> 26984.22s]  Let's go.
[26984.22s -> 26986.14s]  99 fucking percent.
[26987.42s -> 26992.37s]  99 percent chance to hit.
[26992.37s -> 26993.69s]  What the hell?
[26993.69s -> 27000.11s]  Go for it again.
[27000.11s -> 27004.97s]  Get it.
[27004.97s -> 27005.79s]  You missed.
[27005.79s -> 27010.71s]  Fuck you, I win.
[27010.71s -> 27013.37s]  Because I have 100 speed.
[27013.37s -> 27020.48s]  I know, but I won.
[27020.48s -> 27023.52s]  That has pulled a muscle in the front of my left shoulder.
[27023.52s -> 27024.52s]  How did that happen?
[27024.52s -> 27034.66s]  That hurt.
[27034.66s -> 27038.10s]  The young breeders from Toggle, Fane and Rio.
[27038.10s -> 27039.62s]  These new champions will have a new trophy
[27039.62s -> 27043.34s]  sent to them, congratulations.
[27043.34s -> 27044.90s]  Thank you very much.
[27044.90s -> 27046.78s]  The trophy boasts an exotic gem unearthed
[27046.78s -> 27050.02s]  at the ancient ruins of Prometheus.
[27050.02s -> 27051.42s]  It's been a while.
[27051.42s -> 27053.66s]  What the voice of the Gaia stone.
[27053.66s -> 27055.17s]  What is it, Rio?
[27055.17s -> 27058.53s]  The flow of darkness strengthens hurry, you must remember.
[27058.53s -> 27060.65s]  You must protect humans from the very fate
[27060.65s -> 27065.57s]  that they are headed for by their own mistaken actions.
[27065.57s -> 27069.82s]  This is the human monster war that's incoming, right?
[27069.82s -> 27081.16s]  20, 40, 80.
[27081.16s -> 27082.00s]  I was thinking about it.
[27082.00s -> 27082.96s]  What is it, Rio?
[27082.96s -> 27084.71s]  Rio!
[27084.71s -> 27092.47s]  Oh my, quick, bring a stretcher.
[27092.47s -> 27093.99s]  Where am I?
[27093.99s -> 27095.63s]  Rio.
[27095.63s -> 27099.33s]  You fainted on stage, that was a real scare.
[27099.33s -> 27101.61s]  This is the school nurse station.
[27101.61s -> 27103.49s]  But what in the world happened to you?
[27103.49s -> 27105.41s]  Could you tell me?
[27105.41s -> 27108.09s]  Yes, well, you see, a voice from a stone
[27108.09s -> 27111.83s]  and a frightful sight, that's all very strange.
[27111.83s -> 27114.51s]  The Prometheus ruins, where the stone was dug up,
[27114.51s -> 27117.11s]  contains many unsolved mysteries.
[27117.11s -> 27118.31s]  Perhaps if you checked into it,
[27118.31s -> 27121.26s]  we may get to the bottom of things.
[27121.26s -> 27122.46s]  Prometheus ruins, huh?
[27122.46s -> 27123.62s]  Let's go.
[27123.62s -> 27125.26s]  But Rio, have you recovered okay?
[27126.26s -> 27127.22s]  I'm fine now.
[27127.22s -> 27129.39s]  It was just a little shock.
[27129.39s -> 27132.23s]  And I can't just lie around here, let's go.
[27132.23s -> 27140.86s]  Okay, then it's off to the ruins of Prometheus.
[27140.86s -> 27143.10s]  I was gonna do one match in rank S to see what it looks like
[27143.10s -> 27153.99s]  and then turn the stream off.
[27153.99s -> 27160.57s]  I just wanna smell the air in the rank S tournament.
[27166.77s -> 27168.61s]  Look at this shit, here we go.
[27168.61s -> 27189.59s]  Sign up for it, it's today, let's go.
[27189.59s -> 27193.65s]  I didn't save.
[27193.65s -> 27194.65s]  I don't think I can.
[27199.80s -> 27202.88s]  I can smell the game.
[27202.88s -> 27209.62s]  It doesn't matter, this is one and done.
[27209.62s -> 27211.38s]  Whatever, you're fine.
[27211.38s -> 27214.15s]  You're fine, where's Roberto?
[27214.15s -> 27219.28s]  Roberto, why are you doing this?
[27219.28s -> 27221.33s]  You should be resting.
[27221.33s -> 27225.26s]  I'm supposed to see.
[27225.26s -> 27229.06s]  If he dies, I die, what is that?
[27229.06s -> 27232.96s]  Whatever.
[27232.96s -> 27235.36s]  Rank S, I just wanna see it.
[27235.36s -> 27241.55s]  Don't knock over everything.
[27241.55s -> 27247.39s]  Arcadia.
[27247.39s -> 27250.67s]  Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the Arcadia Cup.
[27250.67s -> 27252.03s]  Who will arise victorious?
[27252.03s -> 27253.57s]  There can only be one.
[27253.57s -> 27256.33s]  Now let tournament begin.
[27256.33s -> 27259.54s]  Goldy.
[27259.54s -> 27260.82s]  Holy shit.
[27272.72s -> 27280.78s]  Well, that was a big increase in difficulty.
[27280.78s -> 27281.62s]  What the hell?
[27281.62s -> 27283.78s]  Their circle encompasses my circle.
[27283.78s -> 27319.60s]  This is bad, look at these hit chances.
[27320.44s -> 27325.44s]  Zero percent, zero, zero.
[27333.72s -> 27338.07s]  Well, that's one way to do it.
[27338.07s -> 27351.10s]  Okay, Rudolph versus Maxi Mill.
[27351.10s -> 27352.62s]  We don't even need to see this shit.
[27352.62s -> 27356.49s]  Goldy, look at how, Goldy's impossible.
[27356.49s -> 27362.77s]  What is this nonsense?
[27362.77s -> 27365.81s]  Okay, Ogre versus Goldy.
[27365.81s -> 27377.88s]  Look, it's not even fair.
[27377.88s -> 27380.24s]  I lost 11 fans.
[27380.24s -> 27385.04s]  11% of my fame is gone.
[27385.04s -> 27387.00s]  What a bunch of fucking assholes.
[27387.00s -> 27388.99s]  Not even true fans.
[27388.99s -> 27393.31s]  I one hit KO'd 99 out of 100 monsters.
[27393.31s -> 27394.23s]  And then 11 people are like,
[27394.23s -> 27403.88s]  yeah, I don't like this guy anymore, he didn't win.
[27403.88s -> 27433.62s]  You're really gonna hang up the towel there that quickly?
[27433.62s -> 27434.46s]  He's still alive.
[27435.74s -> 27450.10s]  Just in case something horrible happens.
[27450.10s -> 27452.50s]  All right, I need to get you where you can go, Cali.
[27455.68s -> 27456.56s]  This is nonsense.
[27457.80s -> 27460.60s]  Let me wait four months for another, no.
[27462.48s -> 27463.64s]  I'm gonna call it here.
[27465.03s -> 27465.95s]  I'm gonna call it tonight.
[27465.95s -> 27469.61s]  I'm going for just about eight hours.
[27469.61s -> 27470.45s]  I did not expect,
[27470.45s -> 27476.48s]  that was a huge ramp up in difficulty there.
[27476.48s -> 27478.32s]  So I had one stat that was really good.
[27478.32s -> 27483.02s]  It's like 89 intellect, 106 speed.
[27483.02s -> 27496.60s]  Dude, you gotta use, rank S is the actual video game.
[27496.60s -> 27499.19s]  But I'll call it here, that's it.
[27499.19s -> 27504.64s]  Before it gets too late.
[27504.64s -> 27509.48s]  So Monster Rancher 4, we will probably do, like I said,
[27509.48s -> 27512.72s]  tomorrow is Risk of Rain 2 with Taleks.
[27512.76s -> 27516.94s]  Saturday is the Sekiro scratch-off and German slots.
[27516.94s -> 27521.18s]  And then next week, like a Tuesday or something,
[27521.18s -> 27522.26s]  whenever I, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[27522.26s -> 27525.76s]  whenever I come back next week,
[27525.76s -> 27531.17s]  we're probably gonna do, what are we gonna do next week?
[27531.17s -> 27533.75s]  Should we start with this?
[27533.75s -> 27536.07s]  Yeah, it's still, it's in everybody's mind now.
[27536.07s -> 27537.39s]  After this next couple of days,
[27537.39s -> 27539.19s]  after I take a couple of like two, three days off
[27539.19s -> 27543.09s]  after the weekend, we will come back
[27543.09s -> 27545.81s]  and we will play this a little more.
[27545.81s -> 27550.04s]  Mr. Mosquito and Shadow of Rome.
[27550.04s -> 27551.52s]  After that, I don't think there's gonna be
[27551.52s -> 27553.65s]  more than a couple of days.
[27553.65s -> 27557.41s]  Those three games combined might even be one stream.
[27557.41s -> 27560.22s]  VR is gonna come back after that.
[27560.22s -> 27562.78s]  We'll do a whole week or two of more VR.
[27562.78s -> 27564.22s]  I wanna do some more multiplayer VR.
[27564.22s -> 27570.37s]  I'm gonna do Mind Show, actually do Mind Show.
[27570.37s -> 27578.15s]  There's still a ton of content in VR that I have not done.
[27578.15s -> 27580.78s]  But for the immediate future,
[27580.78s -> 27583.76s]  Risk of Rain 2 tomorrow co-op,
[27583.76s -> 27584.72s]  looks like a really fun game.
[27584.72s -> 27586.53s]  Everyone seems to love it.
[27586.57s -> 27587.81s]  Alex brought it up and it's like,
[27587.81s -> 27588.65s]  yeah, let's just try it.
[27588.65s -> 27591.00s]  Let's see how good it is.
[27591.00s -> 27592.71s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[27592.71s -> 27594.18s]  Thanks for watching.
[27594.18s -> 27597.61s]  Take care.
[27597.61s -> 27600.35s]  Monster Ranger 4 will return for at least some,
[27600.35s -> 27604.65s]  what if it will do, there will be a conclusion.
[27604.65s -> 27607.36s]  Roberto's still alive.
[27607.36s -> 27609.55s]  There's still a fuse potential here.
[27609.55s -> 27614.93s]  There will be a conclusion to Monster Ranger 4.
[27614.93s -> 27618.24s]  But that's gonna be the time.
[27618.24s -> 27620.12s]  We'll see you guys tomorrow.
[27620.12s -> 27620.96s]  Take care of yourselves.
[27620.96s -> 27623.58s]  We're gonna do the bits.
[27623.58s -> 27625.06s]  If you're taking off, see you soon.
[27625.06s -> 27626.38s]  Labo VR is another thing.
[27626.38s -> 27628.85s]  There's a lot of stuff going on.
[27628.85s -> 27634.15s]  Other stings, other projects.
[27634.15s -> 27637.91s]  There's plenty to do.
[27637.91s -> 27641.44s]  Let's head back to earlier today,
[27641.44s -> 27644.81s]  about just about eight hours ago.
[27644.81s -> 27648.05s]  Mandem Requiem, thanks for the $12.
[27648.05s -> 27648.99s]  No message is 12 bucks.
[27648.99s -> 27650.55s]  Thank you so much.
[27650.55s -> 27651.97s]  Dork Cube, thanks for the 250.
[27651.97s -> 27652.81s]  Wait a second, guys.
[27652.81s -> 27655.55s]  What if Jerma doesn't know all this stuff about anime
[27655.55s -> 27657.33s]  because he's a huge weeb,
[27657.33s -> 27660.49s]  but rather it's because Jerma himself is an anime?
[27664.72s -> 27667.06s]  Well, that's a debate that you guys can have
[27667.06s -> 27672.22s]  without me involved, because that's about me.
[27672.22s -> 27673.46s]  I don't know.
[27673.46s -> 27675.70s]  I have no comment there.
[27675.70s -> 27678.30s]  Master of Ceremonies, thanks for the $5.
[27678.30s -> 27681.67s]  They say Hyper Beam.
[27681.67s -> 27684.19s]  I don't know if that is, but thank you for the $10 here.
[27684.19s -> 27687.06s]  $5 again for Master of Ceremonies.
[27687.06s -> 27688.54s]  Is there a way to refund bits?
[27688.54s -> 27690.34s]  I didn't think my hard-earned money
[27690.34s -> 27696.66s]  was going to a weeb streamer.
[27696.66s -> 27697.78s]  Well, you gave five more.
[27697.78s -> 27700.77s]  You gave $5 on top of that.
[27700.77s -> 27701.65s]  Also, before everybody goes,
[27701.65s -> 27704.43s]  I wanna say thanks to Kraiken for the raid.
[27704.43s -> 27706.25s]  If you were still sticking around from Kraiken stream,
[27706.25s -> 27707.95s]  thank you.
[27707.95s -> 27713.12s]  Maybe we'll see you again soon.
[27713.12s -> 27718.12s]  But thank you to Master of Ceremonies for the $10.
[27718.12s -> 27720.28s]  Manboy, thank you, Manboy, for the 250.
[27720.28s -> 27722.00s]  Jerma, you can't hide your weeb ways now.
[27722.00s -> 27726.80s]  I found your MyAnime list.
[27726.80s -> 27732.58s]  AnimeLover985.
[27732.58s -> 27735.02s]  Well, I mean, you clearly just made that account
[27735.02s -> 27744.90s]  and did that.
[27744.90s -> 27745.86s]  Appreciate the 250, though.
[27745.86s -> 27749.27s]  Thank you, Manboy777.
[27749.27s -> 27751.35s]  Jess, you got it, thanks for the 250.
[27751.35s -> 27753.15s]  So there is a species of shrimp
[27753.15s -> 27755.63s]  that has 16 cones in its eyes.
[27755.63s -> 27759.05s]  We have three, red, blue, and green.
[27759.05s -> 27762.59s]  With 16 cones, that's about 500 primary
[27762.59s -> 27764.79s]  and secondary tertiary colors.
[27764.79s -> 27766.91s]  How fucked is that?
[27766.91s -> 27770.17s]  That's weird.
[27770.17s -> 27775.32s]  You just can't, there's no way to know what that looks like.
[27775.32s -> 27779.40s]  So why hasn't science come up with a way to clone that?
[27779.40s -> 27780.40s]  There's no way we can, no.
[27780.40s -> 27783.65s]  Okay, a shrimp is a shrimp, right?
[27783.65s -> 27785.01s]  We don't have a way to find out
[27785.01s -> 27787.69s]  with their genetic DNA and their code
[27787.69s -> 27790.13s]  how that happens and how we can't, you know,
[27790.13s -> 27793.91s]  get eyes, cover our brain with eyes.
[27793.91s -> 27798.18s]  Why can't we do that?
[27798.18s -> 27807.34s]  Our eyes have yet to open.
[27807.34s -> 27810.62s]  I don't know how we can figure that out.
[27810.62s -> 27812.97s]  Thank you, Jess, you got it.
[27812.97s -> 27814.41s]  Sad, Vega, thanks for the 250.
[27814.41s -> 27815.97s]  Jerma, another good stream, but really,
[27815.97s -> 27818.57s]  you as a bartender, that may be your weirdest skit.
[27818.57s -> 27821.61s]  Are you gonna dress up in a fancy bartender tuxedo, too?
[27821.61s -> 27824.21s]  Also, you should take a look at a game called Outward.
[27824.21s -> 27827.41s]  It's kind of an older style RPG, RPG,
[27827.45s -> 27829.37s]  with modern game mechanics that seems really good
[27829.37s -> 27831.75s]  and has co-op you can do with a friend, maybe.
[27834.30s -> 27836.44s]  I don't know, I don't think so.
[27836.44s -> 27837.48s]  That's how Alex played that game,
[27837.48s -> 27843.52s]  and he told me that it was kind of a brutal game
[27843.52s -> 27849.82s]  that was kind of, maybe would be fun with two people,
[27849.82s -> 27851.68s]  but maybe not, I don't think.
[27851.68s -> 27856.62s]  It's not in the cards right now.
[27856.62s -> 27857.86s]  Would you beat Dark Souls?
[27857.86s -> 27859.54s]  I mean, isn't that game like you start,
[27859.54s -> 27865.58s]  like it says Kenshi with a dodge roll?
[27865.58s -> 27866.42s]  We'll see.
[27866.42s -> 27872.45s]  One of the plans does look interesting, though.
[27872.45s -> 27875.56s]  Talk about Outward.
[27875.56s -> 27877.28s]  Holy shit, he didn't say, I'll look into it.
[27877.28s -> 27881.86s]  I'll check it out, but thank you, though.
[27881.86s -> 27887.74s]  Also, thank you to Void01 for the $2.50, the 250.
[27889.14s -> 27892.88s]  Jerma, update on that TF2 item based on your hair.
[27892.88s -> 27893.84s]  It's getting close to being done,
[27893.84s -> 27895.96s]  and we're having some troubles figuring out
[27895.96s -> 27898.40s]  the side and back views.
[27898.40s -> 27900.80s]  Can we get a face cam reference?
[27900.80s -> 27903.52s]  I don't have clothes on,
[27903.56s -> 27906.66s]  so I cannot turn the face cam on.
[27906.66s -> 27910.38s]  I'll give you some references on Saturday,
[27910.38s -> 27913.62s]  because I'll be on face cam the whole time.
[27913.62s -> 27917.36s]  You'll see me Saturday, on camera.
[27917.36s -> 27924.45s]  Ass slap incoming, nope, those are pants.
[27924.45s -> 27927.62s]  But thank you, Void.
[27927.62s -> 27930.30s]  Zalaski, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[27930.30s -> 27933.30s]  Thank you, Zalaski.
[27933.30s -> 27938.30s]  And it is a Giazio, is it linked to a rock?
[27938.30s -> 27945.18s]  Oh, there's a giant Spongebob coin rock thing, okay.
[27945.18s -> 27950.96s]  We were talking about, I've got some weird tangents.
[27950.96s -> 27954.24s]  Sometimes we just go, just start talking about random
[27954.24s -> 27961.81s]  nonsense, but thank you, Zalaski, for the 10 bucks.
[27961.81s -> 27963.47s]  Appreciate it.
[27963.47s -> 27964.71s]  Honey Chain, thanks for the 250.
[27964.71s -> 27967.07s]  Don't you hate it when you buy an ice cold Arizona,
[27967.07s -> 27970.83s]  open it up, take a sip, and it's actually PVR?
[27970.83s -> 27976.65s]  I hate when that happens.
[27976.65s -> 27977.49s]  Thank you for the 250.
[27977.49s -> 27979.13s]  Thank you, Frody and Weapon for the 250.
[27979.13s -> 27982.46s]  Enjoy your two and a half Arizona green teas.
[27982.46s -> 27986.55s]  I will.
[27986.55s -> 27987.95s]  Who drinks their money?
[27988.63s -> 27991.08s]  It was an elaborate conversation.
[27991.08s -> 27992.92s]  I wouldn't even, I can't even describe how that
[27992.92s -> 27994.36s]  conversation even happened.
[27994.36s -> 27997.58s]  Just did.
[27997.58s -> 27999.06s]  Something or other, thanks for the 250.
[27999.06s -> 28000.74s]  Hey, Jerma, bank just called and apparently
[28000.74s -> 28001.98s]  everything is wrong.
[28001.98s -> 28004.38s]  I'm gonna start paying for bits in cash.
[28004.38s -> 28008.06s]  They'll get the first envelope in two to three weeks.
[28008.06s -> 28010.83s]  Cash, paying with cash.
[28010.83s -> 28017.95s]  Where'd you get that cash from?
[28017.95s -> 28021.15s]  You carry that cash, like you're paying in cash.
[28021.15s -> 28022.39s]  Interesting.
[28022.39s -> 28026.58s]  Why, that was weird.
[28026.58s -> 28028.26s]  Hey, Meef, playable, thanks for the 250.
[28028.26s -> 28036.27s]  Monster energy, blood and basil, five stars.
[28036.27s -> 28039.97s]  Mithril bong, thanks for the five dollars.
[28039.97s -> 28044.26s]  Hey, Jerma, just wanted to say go fuck your hat.
[28044.26s -> 28046.17s]  Fuck my hat.
[28046.17s -> 28054.08s]  I'm not wearing a hat, but thanks for the five dollars.
[28054.08s -> 28059.39s]  Hatless today, hatless yesterday.
[28059.39s -> 28062.46s]  But thank you, Mithril bong, for the five bucks.
[28062.46s -> 28063.98s]  Snoozing copter, thanks for the 250.
[28063.98s -> 28065.30s]  Your story reminded me of something.
[28065.30s -> 28067.98s]  One day my mom was doing garden work outside,
[28067.98s -> 28070.30s]  and when she came back in and told me,
[28070.34s -> 28073.54s]  she was hearing scratching sounds in her ear,
[28073.54s -> 28076.30s]  and asked me to take one of those ear magnifying glasses
[28076.30s -> 28079.26s]  to take a look, so I did, and I didn't see anything
[28079.26s -> 28081.46s]  until a spider came crawling at me.
[28082.42s -> 28085.54s]  Imagine looking at a spider through a magnifying glass.
[28085.54s -> 28087.82s]  It's huge, and you could see the eyes and the hairs.
[28087.82s -> 28089.06s]  It was like a jump scare.
[28092.20s -> 28099.55s]  That's, that's un-fucking-believable.
[28099.55s -> 28107.78s]  Your mother had a spider in her ear canal.
[28107.78s -> 28108.62s]  What?
[28111.46s -> 28119.19s]  That, that's what happens in the first hour of a horror movie
[28119.19s -> 28121.19s]  when the main character thinks that something's wrong,
[28121.19s -> 28123.91s]  they got like cursed or grabbed by like the witch
[28123.91s -> 28125.67s]  or something, and then she goes to the,
[28125.67s -> 28127.59s]  or they go to the doctor, or he goes to the doctor,
[28127.59s -> 28129.99s]  and the witch doesn't go to the doctor.
[28129.99s -> 28131.59s]  Well, I'm sure the witch can go to the doctor too,
[28131.59s -> 28132.43s]  that's fine.
[28132.43s -> 28137.75s]  You know, I grabbed somebody, I think I gave him something.
[28137.75s -> 28139.47s]  But the doctor does that.
[28139.47s -> 28140.55s]  That's the part of the horror movie
[28140.55s -> 28148.67s]  where it starts to really turn for the worse.
[28148.67s -> 28153.08s]  What a scary movie.
[28153.08s -> 28154.98s]  That's fucked up though.
[28154.98s -> 28158.34s]  If that's true, that's fucking insane.
[28158.34s -> 28161.42s]  Jerma lied about 5K subs thanks to the 250.
[28161.42s -> 28165.59s]  You did change your name though, I will give you credit.
[28165.59s -> 28167.07s]  Hey Jerma, have you heard of a game called
[28167.07s -> 28170.01s]  Digimon World Championship?
[28170.01s -> 28171.53s]  I had it as a kid and it's like this game,
[28171.53s -> 28173.65s]  but you can't control your monsters in battle.
[28173.65s -> 28175.21s]  You might want to check it out if you like these games.
[28175.21s -> 28177.29s]  We talked about it a couple of days ago.
[28187.28s -> 28190.26s]  He did lie, but it was April Fools.
[28190.26s -> 28192.54s]  It's not a lie if it's April Fools.
[28192.54s -> 28200.78s]  It's an April Fools gag.
[28200.78s -> 28203.18s]  Wait, wait, wait, there's this two Jerma lied now.
[28203.18s -> 28211.38s]  That's not the person changing their name?
[28211.38s -> 28217.38s]  How many of these are there?
[28219.81s -> 28221.50s]  That's funny.
[28221.50s -> 28222.98s]  Hey smelly boy, thanks for the 250.
[28222.98s -> 28225.73s]  Please do an orc impression.
[28225.73s -> 28227.53s]  No, I can't, I can't, it's too late.
[28230.53s -> 28235.24s]  I'm too tired.
[28235.24s -> 28238.88s]  Me, me orc.
[28238.88s -> 28241.76s]  There, that's one of the workers.
[28241.76s -> 28243.04s]  Hey pin, thanks for the 250.
[28243.04s -> 28244.88s]  Hey Jerma, been having some serious heart issues
[28244.88s -> 28247.44s]  due to my ADHD medication.
[28247.44s -> 28249.76s]  Despite the fact that I took the lowest dose.
[28249.80s -> 28252.56s]  I made the decision to taper off of it.
[28252.56s -> 28253.76s]  It's hard to live with ADHD,
[28253.76s -> 28256.24s]  especially because I got a taste of what it was like
[28256.24s -> 28259.76s]  to just think clearly and for the most part, be normal.
[28259.76s -> 28261.64s]  I'm frustrated that nothing in my life seems to go well
[28261.64s -> 28263.88s]  and every time I try to do something to improve my life,
[28263.88s -> 28265.60s]  it ends up making things worse.
[28265.60s -> 28268.23s]  It's been rough.
[28268.23s -> 28270.47s]  I had a similar scenario.
[28270.47s -> 28276.34s]  When I was younger, I was prescribed Ritalin and Adderall
[28277.26s -> 28279.54s]  when I was like 16, 15.
[28279.54s -> 28282.62s]  And I didn't like, I didn't like the way it made me feel.
[28282.62s -> 28287.61s]  So I tapered off it and I stopped taking it.
[28287.61s -> 28288.45s]  But yeah, that's probably when I was,
[28288.45s -> 28290.25s]  that was when I was probably like in high school,
[28290.25s -> 28293.01s]  like junior high maybe, like 14, 15.
[28294.13s -> 28295.69s]  I would know, I wasn't on both at the same time.
[28295.69s -> 28298.25s]  I was on one and then transitioned to the other one.
[28298.25s -> 28300.17s]  But I didn't really like it.
[28300.17s -> 28304.79s]  My appetite dropped.
[28304.79s -> 28310.43s]  It was, I wasn't eating a lot when I was taking Adderall.
[28310.43s -> 28314.54s]  So I tapered off it and stopped doing it.
[28314.54s -> 28318.19s]  But hopefully, in my case at least,
[28318.19s -> 28322.61s]  I just kind of tried to work around it,
[28322.61s -> 28325.13s]  figure out what I was good at doing
[28325.13s -> 28333.82s]  in the time that my brain would focus on it.
[28333.82s -> 28339.11s]  And so far, I mean, I'm in my 30s now, I'm doing all right.
[28339.11s -> 28340.47s]  I'm doing okay with it.
[28340.47s -> 28345.46s]  I mean, you guys know me pretty well at this point.
[28345.46s -> 28347.74s]  Sometimes like it's just, it'll crop up that like,
[28347.74s -> 28351.62s]  holy shit, just all over the place.
[28351.62s -> 28357.51s]  But you know, it is what it is.
[28357.51s -> 28360.46s]  But hopefully you can figure it out
[28360.46s -> 28363.94s]  because it does take time to figure that out.
[28363.94s -> 28365.46s]  And sometimes, sometimes it would mean,
[28365.46s -> 28370.11s]  like you said, low dosages, low dosage of medicines.
[28370.11s -> 28375.09s]  You know, sometimes you do have to get on something
[28375.09s -> 28378.18s]  to kind of start to get better or feel better.
[28378.18s -> 28388.50s]  And that's fine.
[28388.50s -> 28391.77s]  I really hope you get it sorted out soon though.
[28391.77s -> 28398.35s]  Because it can be difficult to work with.
[28398.35s -> 28402.64s]  CBD helps my bad anxiety issues.
[28402.64s -> 28404.68s]  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of research and data
[28404.68s -> 28412.37s]  going into like CBD, things that it can do, the benefits.
[28412.37s -> 28414.82s]  That's a conversation for your doctor though.
[28414.86s -> 28416.06s]  And a lot of doctors are really warming up
[28416.06s -> 28424.87s]  to the fact that that's a possibility.
[28424.87s -> 28429.46s]  But I wish you the best of luck.
[28429.46s -> 28435.32s]  We also had 283, $2.83 from Errolis.
[28435.32s -> 28437.40s]  There's a Jex wallpaper here on Reddit.
[28439.76s -> 28443.99s]  I told you that that was the screenshot, right?
[28443.99s -> 28445.31s]  Why do you have to always use the picture?
[28445.31s -> 28447.79s]  Why do you guys always have to use this fucking picture?
[28447.79s -> 28452.54s]  We're making the face with the crazy eyes.
[28452.54s -> 28455.19s]  There's so many different images you could use.
[28455.19s -> 28457.63s]  It has to be the one with my crazy bug eyes.
[28464.91s -> 28468.95s]  It's a classic.
[28468.99s -> 28473.65s]  Thank you, Errolis, for the 283 and the image.
[28473.65s -> 28478.62s]  Krosk, you know, I have 370 images of you.
[28478.62s -> 28483.46s]  I've got a folder of you.
[28483.46s -> 28486.46s]  If that's what you look like, I know, but still.
[28486.46s -> 28488.14s]  Peek-A-Banana, thanks for the 250.
[28488.14s -> 28491.77s]  They just said Germa Hart, thank you so much.
[28491.77s -> 28494.25s]  Felix Phillips, thanks for the three bucks.
[28494.25s -> 28496.38s]  You're great.
[28496.38s -> 28498.62s]  Thank you, Felix, for the three dollars
[28498.62s -> 28500.46s]  and the incredibly nice message.
[28500.46s -> 28503.87s]  You're great too, thank you.
[28503.87s -> 28511.77s]  Let's get the credits rolling here.
[28511.77s -> 28514.02s]  Thank you so much, everybody.
[28514.02s -> 28515.22s]  All the community subs given tonight.
[28515.22s -> 28518.22s]  All the resubs, all the new subs.
[28518.22s -> 28524.54s]  All of you, thank you.
[28524.54s -> 28528.69s]  Finally, we had Tyler Mike came in with 250.
[28528.69s -> 28530.45s]  Hey, Germa, just wanted to let you know,
[28530.45s -> 28532.81s]  Ace Attorney for PC releases on Tuesday.
[28533.69s -> 28535.53s]  Obviously, you have a lot of stuff planned at this point.
[28535.53s -> 28537.05s]  Just making sure it's on the list.
[28537.05s -> 28538.94s]  It is.
[28538.94s -> 28542.95s]  Those are gonna be some just relaxing streams.
[28542.95s -> 28545.94s]  Kind of like the Monster Rancher streams,
[28545.94s -> 28548.74s]  where we just kind of hang out, talk a lot of shit.
[28548.74s -> 28552.46s]  Have a good time.
[28552.46s -> 28560.32s]  Those will just be fun little chill streams.
[28561.04s -> 28564.87s]  That's gonna have to be after the VR,
[28564.87s -> 28565.99s]  because I do want to get through some more
[28565.99s -> 28570.87s]  that I've had the itch for VR.
[28570.87s -> 28575.10s]  And that's it, thank you everybody for the bits.
[28575.10s -> 28577.62s]  See you all tomorrow.
[28577.62s -> 28581.39s]  More puking.
[28581.39s -> 28583.61s]  When did I puke?
[28583.61s -> 28589.40s]  I mean, I almost puked on the Sekiro stream.
[28589.40s -> 28592.16s]  Hey, should Sekiro have an easy mode?
[28592.16s -> 28593.80s]  I don't know, maybe, I don't think so,
[28593.80s -> 28595.80s]  but ask the guy that almost threw up
[28595.80s -> 28596.96s]  because it was too hard.
[28601.22s -> 28608.95s]  I mean, it almost happened.
[28608.95s -> 28609.91s]  Yeah, the Jaws game too,
[28609.91s -> 28615.83s]  but that was because of motion sickness.
[28615.83s -> 28618.38s]  I was also sick too.
[28618.38s -> 28621.52s]  Try not to use a walkthrough on Ace Attorney.
[28621.52s -> 28625.69s]  No, I got plenty of walkthroughs here.
[28625.69s -> 28628.27s]  They chat in the chat room.
[28628.27s -> 28632.21s]  You guys can help me.
[28632.21s -> 28633.61s]  I'll put like a timer on the screen,
[28633.61s -> 28635.05s]  for if I can't figure the case out,
[28635.05s -> 28637.54s]  then you guys will just tell me the answer.
[28637.54s -> 28640.36s]  I'll make a game out of it.
[28640.36s -> 28642.92s]  I'll give myself like 20 minutes per case.
[28642.92s -> 28644.16s]  And if I just can't do it, then like,
[28644.16s -> 28646.52s]  okay guys, what, help me.
[28646.52s -> 28655.86s]  20 minutes.
[28655.86s -> 28657.38s]  Watch the anime instead.
[28663.55s -> 28667.80s]  That might be better.
[28667.80s -> 28670.22s]  I, what do I got here?
[28670.22s -> 28672.30s]  I gotta clean up this desk.
[28672.30s -> 28674.46s]  My desk is covered in PlayStation 2 games
[28674.46s -> 28676.58s]  and cases and discs and everything.
[28684.42s -> 28691.02s]  Each case is an entire stream after the tutorial, really?
[28691.02s -> 28692.42s]  Am I gonna, am I getting myself into something
[28692.42s -> 28702.57s]  that's gonna be over my head here?
[28702.57s -> 28709.92s]  Yeah, nah, nah, okay.
[28709.92s -> 28711.64s]  All right, well, that's gonna be it.
[28711.64s -> 28715.73s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow for Risk of Rain 2.
[28715.73s -> 28719.51s]  Gonna check it out.
[28719.51s -> 28723.02s]  And after that, see you on Saturday.
[28723.02s -> 28724.56s]  That's all.
[28724.56s -> 28725.68s]  Take care.
[28725.68s -> 28728.50s]  We went a little late tonight, but that's good.
[28728.50s -> 28731.92s]  I mean, it's not good, but it's all good.
[28731.92s -> 28732.76s]  That's what I meant to say.
[28732.76s -> 28738.16s]  It's all good.
[28738.16s -> 28739.86s]  And I'm gonna sit here,
[28739.86s -> 28741.46s]  because it's almost eight hours.
[28741.46s -> 28743.63s]  And you know me.
[28743.63s -> 28745.43s]  It's 7.59.19 right now.
[28745.43s -> 28747.63s]  So I gotta sit here for 40 seconds.
[28747.63s -> 28753.95s]  Wait till it's eight hours so I can turn it off.
[28753.95s -> 28756.09s]  Good night.
[28756.09s -> 28757.65s]  Awkward goodbye streamer.
[28757.65s -> 28760.27s]  Okay, see ya.
[28760.27s -> 28763.98s]  Yeah, see ya, okay.
[28764.02s -> 28764.86s]  Run ads.
[28764.86s -> 28767.39s]  No, I'm not running ads.
[28767.39s -> 28770.46s]  I'll run ads tomorrow.
[28770.46s -> 28781.98s]  I'll run ads tomorrow at the end of tomorrow's stream.
[28781.98s -> 28784.29s]  30 minute ad.
[28784.29s -> 28785.57s]  All right, all right, all right, all right.
[28785.57s -> 28786.41s]  Fine, fine, fine.
[28786.41s -> 28787.25s]  All right, here you go.
[28787.25s -> 28788.09s]  I'm giving you 30 seconds.
[28788.09s -> 28788.93s]  His one 30 second ad, that's it.
[28788.93s -> 28791.29s]  I'm out.
[28791.29s -> 28792.13s]  I promised.
[28792.13s -> 28794.60s]  All right, here's 30 seconds.
[28794.60s -> 28796.84s]  Why do you guys have to beg me for ads?
[28796.84s -> 28803.66s]  This feels wrong on every level.
[28803.66s -> 28806.10s]  All right, see you in 30 seconds.
[28806.10s -> 28809.39s]  Those of you that don't wanna see this, see you tomorrow.
[28809.39s -> 28817.18s]  Here we go.
[28817.18s -> 28821.86s]  It's running.
[28822.50s -> 28826.52s]  Ads.
[28826.52s -> 28832.56s]  I can't see the ads, JermaPluto.
[28832.56s -> 28837.59s]  Okay, if a marketing person saw this chat,
[28837.59s -> 28842.07s]  you know how many emails I would receive
[28842.07s -> 28844.87s]  from various companies if they saw the timestamps
[28844.87s -> 28851.16s]  for these chat messages?
[28851.16s -> 28852.36s]  Holy shit.
[28852.36s -> 28854.88s]  You see that audience of people that are all begging
[28854.88s -> 28857.12s]  for advertisements and to be marketed to?
[28857.12s -> 28859.04s]  Hey, Jerma985, what's going on, man?
[28859.04s -> 28860.68s]  I work for XYZ company,
[28860.68s -> 28862.28s]  and we really wanna do a thing with you.
[28862.28s -> 28873.51s]  Maybe play some ads at the end of your stream.
[28873.51s -> 28877.77s]  All right, people should be coming back now.
[28877.77s -> 28884.73s]  All right, welcome back.
[28884.73s -> 28885.89s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[28885.89s -> 28887.13s]  Take care, guys.
[28887.13s -> 28888.77s]  Hey, thanks for watching the ad.
