[0.89s -> 20.01s]  Hello, my wonderful friends. Good afternoon. Hope you're having a good day. I'm just hanging out. I'm just having a good time.
[20.57s -> 32.66s]  There we go. Hey, why don't we change some music? Yeah, let's change the music a little bit today.
[36.54s -> 44.85s]  Those of you that weren't out here a couple days ago. This is the intro song to Monster Rancher 4. I don't know why.
[45.53s -> 50.84s]  What if this was just my intro?
[50.84s -> 103.34s]  Stream's starting soon, guys. See you in a minute. I can kind of do it again. I thought my cough was kind of back. Remember I couldn't do that last week?
[104.34s -> 112.34s]  Hey, that's what you've been hearing. That's been the intro to Monster Rancher 4. We're going to continue where we left off.
[113.34s -> 125.34s]  We had three wonderful little babies that are starting to grow up into adults. And they're probably going to die really soon, so don't get too attached.
[126.34s -> 138.86s]  But yeah, I was out last night. I took Kim out. It was her birthday weekend, so we went out. It was her birthday weekend.
[140.94s -> 147.61s]  We ended up being able to take the same amount of time off because she works too. So we ended up being able to go out last night.
[148.61s -> 157.61s]  It was really fun. It was great. But the only problem is I have made my sickness come back. I'm coughing again, which sucks because I was just over it.
[160.00s -> 170.91s]  Well, what can you do? But I think I just caused it to come back for a minute.
[174.33s -> 183.62s]  I don't know. Something's going on. Something is going around. I probably got sick with something else. I'd be so pissed.
[185.11s -> 189.11s]  Sick forever. I just keep getting a different strand of the cold.
[192.53s -> 195.53s]  Anyways, let's go right where we left off. Welcome, everybody.
[201.38s -> 206.94s]  I've been sick since I swallowed the semen. I'm like, I know. That's fucked up.
[207.94s -> 214.99s]  I'm going to have to go to the doctor and be like, why have I been sick for like three weeks?
[217.38s -> 225.18s]  I never get sick like this. You guys know that. Maybe like once or twice, maybe once a year, I will get sick like this.
[226.18s -> 235.39s]  Like sort of like coughing and no, never. I have a bunch of other problems, but I never get sick.
[236.39s -> 254.76s]  It was your first winter in Vegas. That's true. It was the Mike and the raw pizza. Raw pizza.
[259.26s -> 263.50s]  As is Vroomer. I catch everybody up that wasn't paying attention last time.
[264.50s -> 268.50s]  Maybe you fell asleep because of a retarded sleeper. Or maybe you were just not here.
[269.50s -> 273.50s]  These are our three monsters. We have Wally, Roberto, and Vroomer.
[274.50s -> 281.32s]  Vroomer is the best currently, but I think Roberto is going to be passing him very soon.
[282.32s -> 291.06s]  But Wally I think is on their way out. They're not very good. They're causing problems.
[292.06s -> 298.32s]  This thing sucks. I'll be honest. But its cute factor brings it to like an eight.
[299.94s -> 303.82s]  So its usefulness is like a four. But look at that dance.
[304.82s -> 311.74s]  We can try fusing Wally with somebody. How about this? This is what we're going to do.
[312.74s -> 318.71s]  We're going to say goodbye to Wally, but we're not going to say bye.
[318.71s -> 322.71s]  We're not going to say bye. We're going to say hello to their fresh DNA.
[323.71s -> 326.71s]  And we're going to fuse them with somebody else. Because we're going to put some more CDs in.
[327.71s -> 338.14s]  Give him...I'm a monster.
[342.90s -> 344.90s]  Let me...alright, here's what's going to happen.
[345.90s -> 347.90s]  Let me see...no, no, no, don't do that.
[348.90s -> 356.59s]  Let's take a look at the calendar. I didn't win in the D rank. I got cheesed by the enemy.
[356.59s -> 364.83s]  They resurrected twice. But I think you unlock more monsters when somebody gets up here.
[365.83s -> 369.83s]  So we were almost here, but I got screwed.
[370.83s -> 373.83s]  So unfortunately we got to go back and do that again.
[374.83s -> 376.83s]  That was kind of an annoying moment, but whatever.
[377.83s -> 381.65s]  For the time being, I think it's time.
[384.36s -> 387.24s]  It's time to freeze Wally.
[388.24s -> 391.24s]  We're going to have them forever.
[392.24s -> 400.30s]  Everyone's going to be very upset about this.
[404.55s -> 405.55s]  Just wait longer.
[407.30s -> 409.61s]  I kind of want to put in some more CDs.
[416.16s -> 418.16s]  Let's be honest here.
[419.78s -> 421.78s]  I want to see a couple more CDs worth of monsters.
[422.78s -> 428.02s]  And Wally's just the weakest link out of the three of them. That's just the way it is.
[428.02s -> 435.00s]  High King Milk, 10 community subs.
[436.00s -> 442.50s]  What is it with Monster Rancher 4 and community subs right off the bat? 10.
[443.50s -> 444.50s]  Thank you, High King Milk.
[447.02s -> 453.18s]  His intelligence is so high, but he just don't...
[454.18s -> 463.34s]  Let me take a look at this.
[464.34s -> 467.34s]  So this is 216, 199, 200.
[468.34s -> 469.64s]  But better moves.
[470.64s -> 473.64s]  This is 242, 139, 182.
[473.64s -> 475.64s]  Alright, maybe not.
[478.03s -> 482.03s]  Maybe if I just increase his accuracy, he'll be good.
[483.03s -> 491.65s]  Roberto just doesn't have high stats, but the moves, they hit so often and they're so good.
[497.82s -> 499.82s]  Maybe Vroomer. Vroomer sucks.
[501.44s -> 503.44s]  No, I've said that about all three of them. They're all good.
[504.44s -> 511.93s]  Look, Vroomer is almost a year and three months old.
[513.17s -> 515.17s]  And Roberto is about to pass them.
[517.18s -> 518.18s]  You understand?
[519.48s -> 520.48s]  D, he's not even one.
[522.17s -> 524.17s]  It might be time to put Vroomer on ice.
[533.28s -> 535.28s]  Alright, I'm going to give it a couple more weeks.
[536.65s -> 545.34s]  If Vroomer and Wally can prove in the next two or three weeks of training that they're worth keeping around, then I'll keep them.
[546.65s -> 548.65s]  I'm telling you, one or two of them are gone.
[552.13s -> 553.13s]  We can even combine them.
[555.20s -> 559.82s]  I could combine Vroomer with Roberto or Wally.
[560.82s -> 562.58s]  Alright, what have we got for schedule?
[563.58s -> 569.10s]  You know what? Fuck it.
[570.28s -> 571.28s]  I'm going to combine the two of them.
[572.28s -> 575.50s]  Let's go.
[576.50s -> 577.50s]  Roberto is our ranked player.
[578.50s -> 579.50s]  We're just going to mess with DNA now.
[582.79s -> 584.79s]  Look, the game is saved, so if this sucks, I'll just save this comment.
[591.66s -> 603.98s]  Goodbye, Vroomer.
[604.98s -> 609.29s]  See, he's happy.
[610.29s -> 612.29s]  Alright, now let's retire Wally and we're going to fuse them together.
[613.29s -> 615.98s]  We're going to get a nut on a wheel.
[616.98s -> 617.98s]  How do you guys not think that's cool?
[618.98s -> 619.98s]  I do.
[620.98s -> 628.28s]  It's cool, man.
[629.28s -> 630.28s]  You're going to get a pinwheel.
[630.28s -> 631.28s]  Alright, here we go.
[635.14s -> 636.96s]  Combine.
[637.96s -> 638.96s]  Let's see.
[640.97s -> 641.97s]  We still have these idiots here.
[642.97s -> 645.94s]  Alright, Vroomer and Wally.
[648.58s -> 649.58s]  What happens?
[652.04s -> 655.04s]  Skunk Roller and Suzurecho.
[660.89s -> 661.89s]  Sprite.
[667.10s -> 669.10s]  The base stats are not really that good.
[675.39s -> 676.39s]  Skunk Roller.
[680.00s -> 681.00s]  Wind Lore, Backspin.
[682.00s -> 683.75s]  It's just a wheel.
[684.75s -> 685.75s]  Attack and...
[685.75s -> 692.34s]  These both sound like Twitch emotes.
[693.34s -> 697.46s]  Let's do it.
[699.15s -> 700.15s]  Let's see what happens.
[701.15s -> 711.61s]  I'll save scumming.
[712.61s -> 713.61s]  Okay, well Vroomer just consumed.
[717.02s -> 718.02s]  That's just Vroomer.
[719.02s -> 721.02s]  It was unfrozen and ate the walnut and then just walked out.
[722.02s -> 725.70s]  No.
[731.54s -> 732.54s]  Vroomer and...
[733.72s -> 734.72s]  Okay, what about High Intelligence?
[735.72s -> 736.72s]  What about Wonka and Wally?
[737.72s -> 747.34s]  Mush Tan.
[748.34s -> 749.34s]  Pumpkey Plant.
[749.34s -> 753.06s]  Pumpkey Plant has actually pretty high...
[754.06s -> 756.06s]  Actually, Mush Tan does too.
[757.06s -> 760.28s]  Look at the health on Mush Tan.
[761.28s -> 766.94s]  That's not bad base stats.
[767.94s -> 768.94s]  Mush Tan.
[776.26s -> 777.26s]  Let's see, what do you look at?
[782.53s -> 783.53s]  It's a plant, right?
[784.53s -> 785.53s]  No.
[786.53s -> 787.53s]  We've seen it already.
[788.53s -> 789.53s]  I don't want this.
[806.19s -> 807.19s]  Oh my god.
[811.06s -> 812.06s]  I kind of have to keep this one.
[813.06s -> 819.61s]  How about Wally Wonka?
[820.61s -> 825.30s]  No.
[826.30s -> 827.30s]  Let's do Shroomer.
[832.32s -> 833.32s]  We already had a Shroomer.
[835.01s -> 836.70s]  How about like Prove It To Me?
[837.70s -> 838.70s]  Yeah, that's a good name.
[849.02s -> 850.02s]  Prove It To Me.
[856.77s -> 859.22s]  Come on.
[860.22s -> 861.22s]  Prove it to me.
[862.66s -> 863.66s]  Prove it to me.
[864.66s -> 867.73s]  That's worse than hashtag V.
[871.21s -> 873.21s]  Yeah, I know how to spell prove it, guys.
[873.21s -> 878.21s]  Look, it needs to fit in this tiny amount of characters that can fit here.
[884.18s -> 885.18s]  Prove it to me.
[888.41s -> 889.41s]  Prove to me.
[890.41s -> 891.97s]  No, that sucks.
[892.97s -> 893.97s]  That's worse than what I did.
[921.92s -> 922.92s]  Prover.
[932.16s -> 933.72s]  Let's see if they can prove it.
[934.72s -> 943.58s]  Let's get a couple of discs in here.
[944.58s -> 945.58s]  High base stats, though.
[945.58s -> 948.48s]  All right, Prover.
[949.48s -> 950.48s]  I need to go back.
[951.66s -> 952.66s]  We got Roberto.
[953.66s -> 954.66s]  Shrine.
[955.66s -> 958.47s]  Let's get some more discs in here.
[961.76s -> 964.76s]  Roberto is going to climb the ranks real fast, so don't worry about losing progress there.
[965.76s -> 966.76s]  All you really need is just one.
[970.24s -> 971.24s]  Create.
[972.80s -> 975.13s]  All right, from a saucer.
[976.13s -> 977.62s]  What's going in?
[978.62s -> 988.95s]  I've got Dark Souls.
[989.95s -> 990.95s]  I don't even own Dark Souls.
[991.95s -> 992.95s]  The actual physical copy.
[992.95s -> 993.95s]  I don't think I own any of them.
[995.26s -> 996.26s]  How about Dynamite Cop?
[997.26s -> 998.26s]  Or Space Channel 5 is down here, too.
[1001.54s -> 1002.54s]  Let's put in Dynamite Cop.
[1003.98s -> 1004.98s]  Here, I'll prove it.
[1006.22s -> 1007.22s]  Hey, don't worry, I'll be a Prover.
[1009.10s -> 1010.10s]  How do I look today?
[1013.96s -> 1017.06s]  Probably bad.
[1017.06s -> 1020.02s]  No, not that bad.
[1021.02s -> 1022.02s]  Here, Dynamite Cop for the Dreamcast.
[1031.39s -> 1032.39s]  Going to insert CD into the disc tray.
[1039.01s -> 1041.01s]  After this, I'll put Red Box in after this.
[1049.35s -> 1050.35s]  It's going to be a Shroomer.
[1051.78s -> 1053.78s]  If it is, then I'm just going to accept fate and just wait until we unlock more.
[1053.78s -> 1060.48s]  And you get some really good McDonald's M hair today.
[1061.48s -> 1077.95s]  But I should just spray paint.
[1078.95s -> 1079.95s]  Or what's the spray color?
[1080.95s -> 1081.95s]  My hair?
[1083.70s -> 1085.58s]  Yellow in the front there.
[1087.40s -> 1088.40s]  All right, here we go.
[1089.40s -> 1090.40s]  Oh, by the way, I have something to talk about.
[1091.40s -> 1093.40s]  I got approval from somebody at Twitch.
[1094.40s -> 1098.40s]  The Scratch Ticket charity stream is going to happen.
[1099.40s -> 1100.40s]  Probably in the next couple days.
[1100.40s -> 1101.40s]  For the deaths in Sekiro.
[1103.02s -> 1104.02s]  Oh my fucking God, it's fate.
[1105.02s -> 1106.97s]  I'm just going to play.
[1107.97s -> 1108.97s]  Should I just take them both?
[1115.07s -> 1121.62s]  Let's try a different one.
[1122.62s -> 1123.62s]  Let's try Space Channel.
[1132.93s -> 1136.73s]  Give me a break.
[1137.73s -> 1139.73s]  Is it because they're Dreamcast and all Dreamcast games are the same game?
[1140.73s -> 1143.12s]  Well, this is not even a Dreamcast game, so that's fine.
[1144.12s -> 1147.12s]  Space Channel 5, this is the bootleg one, isn't it?
[1148.12s -> 1149.87s]  So, you know what I mean?
[1152.07s -> 1153.07s]  This is the bootleg one.
[1154.07s -> 1155.38s]  This is not even a Sega Dreamcast game.
[1155.38s -> 1158.38s]  This is somebody like burnt this on their fucking Windows 2000 computer.
[1159.38s -> 1170.86s]  Something.
[1176.70s -> 1177.70s]  Something that's not the mushroom guy.
[1178.70s -> 1183.76s]  I would be, it's going to be the mushroom, it's going to be Dreamcast.
[1184.76s -> 1187.76s]  Because all the Dreamcast games have the same internal seed or something.
[1188.76s -> 1192.06s]  I'm going to have to grab other disks that are not Dreamcast.
[1193.06s -> 1199.23s]  Okay.
[1211.10s -> 1212.10s]  Dreamcast used proprietary code.
[1213.10s -> 1214.66s]  So maybe it is.
[1215.66s -> 1217.66s]  Maybe they can't, maybe you can't pull data from Dreamcast.
[1231.25s -> 1232.25s]  Okay, come on.
[1233.25s -> 1240.65s]  The fungus is a catch-all for any disk that's too new.
[1242.46s -> 1244.28s]  I'm going to have to get some old shit.
[1245.28s -> 1246.28s]  I got some old shit here.
[1250.53s -> 1251.53s]  It's a meat rumor.
[1253.41s -> 1254.41s]  We just replaced this one.
[1255.41s -> 1256.41s]  We just replaced the rumor with meat rumor.
[1263.02s -> 1264.02s]  It's just Cheeto dusted rumor.
[1265.02s -> 1266.02s]  We already talked about this.
[1267.02s -> 1274.34s]  Upgraded.
[1275.34s -> 1279.46s]  No.
[1280.46s -> 1281.46s]  No, no, no.
[1283.66s -> 1285.10s]  I'm putting in Redbox.
[1286.10s -> 1287.10s]  Redbox is about to go in.
[1287.10s -> 1297.38s]  And then, like somebody said, you might as well just grind up to rank A.
[1298.38s -> 1300.38s]  I got a really good monster to grind up to rank A.
[1301.38s -> 1306.94s]  We're just going to just, we're steamrolling all the competitions.
[1307.94s -> 1313.73s]  Let's get this here.
[1314.73s -> 1316.61s]  Too new?
[1317.61s -> 1319.61s]  We'll just use standard DVDs and CDs and PS1, PS2 disks.
[1320.61s -> 1321.61s]  Copy protection doesn't affect those.
[1322.61s -> 1323.85s]  Interesting.
[1324.85s -> 1326.34s]  But here is, here's Redbox.
[1330.46s -> 1331.46s]  It's a great CD.
[1336.35s -> 1337.35s]  Redbox guy, come on.
[1338.35s -> 1340.55s]  Give us something here.
[1340.55s -> 1342.55s]  This is a regular, just CD, DVD.
[1343.55s -> 1345.55s]  It's not like a protected code from Dreamcast.
[1348.20s -> 1351.20s]  Watch like Vinnie come in here and goes, oh, actually, we use like the protected code, man.
[1352.20s -> 1353.20s]  You're going to get a fucking shroomer.
[1367.11s -> 1368.48s]  What is it?
[1376.12s -> 1377.12s]  Something cool. Come on.
[1378.12s -> 1379.12s]  To get a monster with higher stats, the two monsters you're combining need to be friends.
[1381.00s -> 1382.00s]  What?
[1383.00s -> 1384.00s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
[1385.00s -> 1390.00s]  To get a monster with better, with higher stats, the two monsters you're combining need to be friends.
[1390.00s -> 1395.00s]  You can see how good of friends they are by going into the Breeder tab and going to the last page.
[1397.20s -> 1398.20s]  What?
[1399.38s -> 1400.38s]  How can you be friends when you're frozen and dead?
[1401.38s -> 1402.94s]  I don't know how that works.
[1403.94s -> 1409.78s]  KD, five community subs.
[1410.78s -> 1411.78s]  Thank you, KD.
[1414.94s -> 1415.94s]  Welcome back.
[1418.85s -> 1419.85s]  KD, give him more subs.
[1421.15s -> 1422.15s]  Thank you so much, KD.
[1426.46s -> 1433.72s]  Now we got a robo bunny.
[1434.72s -> 1438.84s]  Yeah.
[1439.84s -> 1441.59s]  Yeah, we're taking this monster home.
[1442.59s -> 1443.59s]  We got a farm full of robots.
[1444.59s -> 1448.82s]  It's a X bunny.
[1449.82s -> 1451.31s]  No.
[1453.45s -> 1454.45s]  Bunny.
[1462.22s -> 1463.22s]  The energizer rabbit.
[1464.22s -> 1466.42s]  Did the energizer rabbit have a name?
[1467.42s -> 1468.42s]  I like energizer.
[1473.82s -> 1474.82s]  It was bunny. No, it was not.
[1479.90s -> 1480.90s]  Five more community subs from KD.
[1481.90s -> 1482.90s]  Thank you, KD.
[1483.90s -> 1485.14s]  Again, ten now.
[1486.14s -> 1488.98s]  How about a, how about vroomer?
[1489.98s -> 1490.98s]  How about, how about energizer?
[1492.22s -> 1497.49s]  Like this.
[1505.64s -> 1513.92s]  The energizer.
[1514.92s -> 1516.86s]  Energize sleep.
[1517.86s -> 1528.90s]  All right, energize.
[1529.90s -> 1531.07s]  He's a little sleepy.
[1532.07s -> 1535.49s]  All right, let's go to the ranch.
[1536.49s -> 1537.86s]  We got some new stuff.
[1548.89s -> 1549.89s]  It's time.
[1550.89s -> 1552.64s]  So here are the two.
[1553.64s -> 1555.20s]  We got energize prover and Roberto.
[1556.20s -> 1557.20s]  Roberto is, sole purpose is to grind tournaments.
[1558.20s -> 1560.20s]  These two are going to just relax.
[1561.20s -> 1562.20s]  I don't care.
[1563.20s -> 1564.82s]  They're not joining any tournaments.
[1565.82s -> 1566.82s]  Let me take a little bit.
[1572.48s -> 1573.48s]  Let's just hold that thought.
[1576.00s -> 1580.00s]  Yeah, you guys just rest and eat and just go to training.
[1581.00s -> 1582.00s]  You are going to grind tournaments.
[1583.00s -> 1594.43s]  In each rank unlocks more monster fusion types.
[1595.43s -> 1598.43s]  So after D, new races unlock is possible on the discs you put in.
[1599.43s -> 1600.43s]  All right, cool.
[1601.43s -> 1602.43s]  So let's, it's going to grind up tournaments.
[1603.43s -> 1604.43s]  When's the next one?
[1605.43s -> 1606.43s]  More community subs from KD.
[1607.80s -> 1608.80s]  My God.
[1609.80s -> 1610.80s]  Thank you, KD.
[1611.80s -> 1612.80s]  For your, every five minutes.
[1612.80s -> 1614.55s]  Is it the tournament today?
[1615.55s -> 1616.55s]  Let's go.
[1617.55s -> 1618.55s]  Join it, Roberto.
[1619.55s -> 1621.88s]  He's ready.
[1622.88s -> 1623.88s]  Just crush the competition.
[1627.36s -> 1628.36s]  He's so good.
[1629.36s -> 1631.24s]  And you guys, who gives a shit?
[1632.24s -> 1637.77s]  You can just do whatever you want.
[1638.77s -> 1639.94s]  No, automatic for technique.
[1643.23s -> 1646.23s]  I mean you, automatic for speed.
[1647.23s -> 1648.86s]  Yeah, who cares?
[1649.86s -> 1651.42s]  They're just DNA.
[1652.42s -> 1654.74s]  Roberto is going to do life training today.
[1655.74s -> 1660.89s]  It's a little quiet.
[1661.89s -> 1665.56s]  Nine health from Roberto.
[1666.56s -> 1672.02s]  That's good.
[1673.02s -> 1675.03s]  Kill or be killed?
[1676.03s -> 1677.03s]  You're doing just good.
[1678.03s -> 1679.03s]  Let's give you some food.
[1680.03s -> 1681.03s]  Because we have to just grind tournaments.
[1682.03s -> 1683.03s]  Oh shit, I'm out of food.
[1684.03s -> 1685.78s]  You can use squid today.
[1691.63s -> 1692.63s]  I'll go buy some food tomorrow.
[1693.63s -> 1694.63s]  Let's see how funny.
[1696.51s -> 1700.82s]  Okay, depending on how funny and cute they are.
[1701.82s -> 1702.82s]  You're a lot bigger than I thought you were.
[1705.41s -> 1706.41s]  I hate this thing so much.
[1707.90s -> 1710.90s]  I really hope that that stupid mushroom is not the most powerful thing we have.
[1712.90s -> 1718.30s]  We all love him.
[1719.30s -> 1720.30s]  No, you don't.
[1721.30s -> 1723.30s]  I can't wait to see in the chat in an hour or two.
[1724.30s -> 1726.06s]  Burn him.
[1727.06s -> 1728.06s]  Just eat him.
[1729.06s -> 1730.06s]  Ice him.
[1731.06s -> 1733.83s]  Kill that fucking stupid thing.
[1734.83s -> 1739.98s]  It's going to be everywhere.
[1740.98s -> 1741.98s]  It's the dumbest monster that we've ever seen.
[1743.22s -> 1744.22s]  And there's going to be an argument in chat.
[1745.22s -> 1746.22s]  I don't know why you guys think that.
[1747.22s -> 1748.65s]  Like why do you think that?
[1749.65s -> 1750.65s]  Like that person's name.
[1751.65s -> 1752.65s]  Like are you stupid?
[1757.54s -> 1762.54s]  I saw, I see that you've only been a follower of the channel for like two months.
[1763.54s -> 1764.71s]  I was here when Beanbag Sonic was created.
[1765.71s -> 1766.71s]  You don't know shit, idiot.
[1767.71s -> 1768.71s]  And then that person's going to be like, fuck you man.
[1769.71s -> 1770.71s]  It's going to cause problems.
[1771.71s -> 1782.74s]  Don't do that.
[1784.43s -> 1785.99s]  All right, what do you got?
[1786.99s -> 1787.99s]  Nothing.
[1792.82s -> 1793.82s]  I don't even need to look at the stats.
[1794.82s -> 1795.82s]  Roberto is too good.
[1796.82s -> 1798.95s]  I see you've only been a follower for two months.
[1802.69s -> 1803.69s]  I was here when Beanbag Sonic was created.
[1804.69s -> 1805.69s]  Look at that thing.
[1810.00s -> 1813.67s]  It really is cooking.
[1818.30s -> 1820.82s]  It's all right.
[1828.21s -> 1829.21s]  It's a little rusty.
[1830.21s -> 1831.21s]  This is such a high hit for someone.
[1834.50s -> 1835.50s]  I just need to do three of these and we can get the secret.
[1836.50s -> 1846.18s]  Guy versus Ghassan.
[1847.18s -> 1850.09s]  Ghassan wins.
[1853.95s -> 1854.95s]  And then the championship is against Ghassan.
[1855.95s -> 1856.95s]  This is one of those big rocks.
[1857.95s -> 1858.95s]  Lots of life.
[1859.95s -> 1860.95s]  Pretty good defense.
[1861.95s -> 1862.95s]  Just kind of have to knock it hit.
[1866.75s -> 1867.75s]  That'll be good.
[1868.75s -> 1869.75s]  Guy Ghassan was a French revolutionary, I think.
[1874.77s -> 1878.12s]  Guy Ghassan.
[1879.12s -> 1881.77s]  Monster.
[1884.29s -> 1886.49s]  Bingo.
[1887.49s -> 1889.30s]  And then we can go with a shoulder tackle.
[1890.30s -> 1894.38s]  This, if you don't think we're going to grind up the tournaments and win them.
[1895.38s -> 1896.38s]  With Roberto.
[1897.38s -> 1899.38s]  It was a long shot with Rumor because Rumor didn't have very good accuracy.
[1901.83s -> 1903.83s]  I should win all these up to like rank C or B.
[1915.76s -> 1917.76s]  One final tip from the Monster Rancher expert.
[1918.76s -> 1924.76s]  The good trick is to get the house that allows you to have four monsters have three you don't care about doing exploring.
[1924.76s -> 1927.76s]  And one you use to get your rank up.
[1928.76s -> 1929.76s]  All right.
[1930.76s -> 1932.76s]  Well, I already meeting you halfway there because I already don't care about the other two.
[1933.76s -> 1935.76s]  So I'm already getting to that point.
[1944.04s -> 1948.35s]  I miss Wally, but you gotta move on.
[1958.94s -> 1959.94s]  All right.
[1961.88s -> 1962.88s]  So let's go to the calendar.
[1963.88s -> 1965.88s]  The next tournament here is for Roberto.
[1966.88s -> 1967.88s]  Sign you up for that one.
[1968.88s -> 1969.88s]  Just do any every single one I can do in a row.
[1970.88s -> 1972.06s]  That's at least ranked D.
[1972.06s -> 1977.06s]  Now the other two are going to just go for go on a walk.
[1978.06s -> 1984.22s]  Let me take a look at this.
[1985.22s -> 1986.22s]  So you let me do.
[1987.22s -> 1988.22s]  Why don't you just do intelligence.
[1989.22s -> 1991.22s]  Just make it at least look like you're trying.
[1994.22s -> 1995.22s]  And then speed.
[1996.22s -> 1999.22s]  I don't have to think of speed accuracy.
[2000.22s -> 2003.64s]  What did you have Roberto?
[2004.64s -> 2005.64s]  You can sleep now.
[2006.64s -> 2008.14s]  You're good.
[2008.14s -> 2009.14s]  I think you can do life again, right?
[2010.14s -> 2012.08s]  Yeah, life blade then rest.
[2013.08s -> 2018.66s]  I think I should maybe I should bring them all exploring because Roberto's almost level five.
[2019.66s -> 2024.49s]  I need food.
[2026.56s -> 2033.77s]  I'll go to town this week because he does that with his ears.
[2034.77s -> 2035.77s]  Weirdly enough.
[2037.01s -> 2038.01s]  Yeah, you are tired.
[2039.01s -> 2052.79s]  You're tired. I don't want to bring you.
[2053.79s -> 2054.79s]  Oh, I hate you so much.
[2059.62s -> 2060.62s]  Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it.
[2061.62s -> 2065.29s]  I'm turning the page with his face.
[2066.29s -> 2073.03s]  I need food.
[2073.03s -> 2077.92s]  I would like to buy.
[2078.92s -> 2079.92s]  I got lots of money.
[2081.29s -> 2084.29s]  Let's get some like 10 potatoes because I always use them.
[2085.29s -> 2090.41s]  Let's get like five bananas.
[2091.41s -> 2094.25s]  Maybe a couple of squids.
[2096.25s -> 2097.25s]  Beef is too expensive.
[2098.49s -> 2099.49s]  Squid.
[2100.49s -> 2102.49s]  I'll get like three squids for Roberto.
[2103.86s -> 2106.76s]  And.
[2109.76s -> 2113.76s]  I feel like I said I have so much stuff to sell, but I don't know the hell it does.
[2114.76s -> 2121.33s]  Like Yu-Gi-Oh cards.
[2122.33s -> 2123.33s]  These battle cards.
[2124.33s -> 2125.33s]  What are these even for?
[2126.33s -> 2127.33s]  Silver coin, amethyst.
[2128.33s -> 2130.57s]  Hey, where's the monster rancher expert?
[2131.57s -> 2132.57s]  You still here?
[2133.57s -> 2134.57s]  What are these for?
[2142.66s -> 2143.66s]  Yes, I am. All right. What what are these for?
[2144.66s -> 2147.30s]  Should I just sell all this expensive stuff?
[2148.30s -> 2149.30s]  Luxuries?
[2152.85s -> 2153.85s]  It's for fusions later on.
[2154.85s -> 2155.85s]  Okay, so don't use them.
[2155.85s -> 2157.34s]  Ooh.
[2158.84s -> 2159.84s]  All right. Don't use these either.
[2160.84s -> 2162.27s]  I'm not going to use them. I'm going to hold on.
[2172.09s -> 2173.09s]  I hate forever so much.
[2174.09s -> 2175.09s]  I'm whimpering right now.
[2176.09s -> 2180.21s]  Don't worry.
[2181.21s -> 2182.21s]  We'll only walk the plank in like a few days.
[2186.71s -> 2187.71s]  Some of those will relieve stress.
[2188.71s -> 2193.46s]  Okay, the way we raise Roberto from this point on will determine the difference between victory and defeat.
[2194.46s -> 2196.83s]  Roberto is now no longer a baby.
[2197.83s -> 2202.59s]  Rest.
[2203.59s -> 2204.59s]  And then you got a sandbag.
[2205.59s -> 2206.59s]  Let me take an actual look here.
[2207.59s -> 2209.47s]  220 power.
[2210.47s -> 2213.47s]  Accuracy could use a little work and so could speed.
[2215.35s -> 2216.35s]  Accuracy and speed.
[2217.35s -> 2218.35s]  Although his moves are so accurate anyways.
[2220.42s -> 2221.42s]  All right. What does it say? Your favorite food?
[2222.42s -> 2230.58s]  His moves.
[2232.14s -> 2233.70s]  Traits, super weapon.
[2234.70s -> 2235.70s]  Record.
[2236.70s -> 2237.70s]  Temper, cool, size, normal. Likes, reference.
[2238.70s -> 2239.70s]  Doesn't like to sleep.
[2240.70s -> 2246.82s]  What do you mean likes to be referenced?
[2251.32s -> 2258.46s]  Why would you not like to sleep?
[2259.46s -> 2260.46s]  That's kind of strange.
[2265.67s -> 2266.67s]  You have to rest though.
[2267.67s -> 2268.67s]  Do you have to rest?
[2272.41s -> 2273.41s]  Maybe he doesn't have to sleep.
[2274.41s -> 2275.41s]  Okay, well.
[2278.76s -> 2280.64s]  All right.
[2282.65s -> 2283.65s]  What about these other two?
[2284.65s -> 2285.65s]  Let's make sure they're at least doing something.
[2287.46s -> 2288.46s]  Let's do automatic.
[2289.46s -> 2290.96s]  Ah, fuck me.
[2291.96s -> 2298.06s]  I didn't mean to press X.
[2299.06s -> 2300.62s]  Let me go talk to him.
[2301.62s -> 2304.27s]  He likes references.
[2305.27s -> 2306.27s]  I have those.
[2307.27s -> 2308.27s]  Item, reference.
[2309.27s -> 2310.27s]  Items of knowledge.
[2311.64s -> 2312.64s]  Here.
[2315.42s -> 2316.42s]  I just have to show it to him and he likes it.
[2319.19s -> 2320.19s]  Is he holding it?
[2322.01s -> 2324.72s]  Ah.
[2327.37s -> 2328.37s]  He doesn't even read it.
[2329.37s -> 2330.37s]  He just looks at it and goes, yes.
[2333.34s -> 2334.70s]  He's happy.
[2338.44s -> 2339.44s]  That's my favorite book.
[2363.32s -> 2365.32s]  As you know, I'm building an underdog story here.
[2370.40s -> 2372.77s]  Let's take, let's get them.
[2373.77s -> 2374.77s]  Yeah, let's go.
[2376.46s -> 2377.46s]  Let's still do the caves.
[2378.46s -> 2379.46s]  Try to level up again.
[2381.21s -> 2382.21s]  Bring him up.
[2392.98s -> 2393.98s]  Kill the shroom.
[2397.78s -> 2398.78s]  No, I want to progress in the cave.
[2399.78s -> 2403.20s]  Because he's almost level five.
[2404.20s -> 2408.02s]  This will at least get him maybe into the move or another trade maybe.
[2409.02s -> 2410.02s]  That'd be good.
[2416.06s -> 2417.06s]  Oh yeah, right.
[2417.06s -> 2419.38s]  I have to turn this down every time I come in here.
[2420.38s -> 2421.38s]  Give shroom a chance to let him prove himself.
[2425.63s -> 2426.63s]  Nah.
[2427.63s -> 2428.63s]  It's going to end up as a scenario where he accidentally comes.
[2428.63s -> 2429.63s]  Roberto's going to get hurt.
[2431.64s -> 2432.64s]  And shroom is going to have to come off the bench.
[2433.64s -> 2434.64s]  It's going to be the last person.
[2435.82s -> 2436.82s]  I'm going to be the coach sitting there staring into the audience.
[2437.82s -> 2439.82s]  Being like, is there anybody in here that I can throw?
[2440.82s -> 2441.82s]  Any of you?
[2442.82s -> 2443.82s]  I'm looking for my star quarterback got hurt.
[2445.06s -> 2446.06s]  And no one's going to raise their hands.
[2447.06s -> 2449.06s]  And I'm going to have to go to the bench and there's going to be the shroom.
[2450.06s -> 2452.06s]  And I'm going to, I'm going to wince and go.
[2453.06s -> 2454.49s]  Get in there.
[2455.49s -> 2456.98s]  He's going to be like, oh, okay.
[2457.98s -> 2459.98s]  It's going to be a very, very defining moment of his character.
[2460.98s -> 2461.98s]  He's going to get in.
[2462.98s -> 2463.98s]  He's going to get the ball.
[2464.98s -> 2465.98s]  And it's going to be, here we go with like five seconds left.
[2466.98s -> 2467.98s]  One, two, three.
[2468.98s -> 2469.98s]  And he's going to go back.
[2471.48s -> 2472.48s]  It's going to be in slow motion.
[2473.48s -> 2474.48s]  And here comes like somebody on the left.
[2475.48s -> 2476.48s]  Oh, it's a blitz.
[2477.48s -> 2478.48s]  It's an all out blitz.
[2480.23s -> 2481.23s]  And as his sweats coming down his head, he's got to prove that one fucking point away from a win.
[2482.23s -> 2483.23s]  Literally, he rears back to throw.
[2484.23s -> 2485.23s]  And the cuts to the coach.
[2486.23s -> 2487.54s]  Can't believe it.
[2487.54s -> 2488.54s]  Oh, did I make the right decision?
[2489.54s -> 2490.54s]  Somebody comes he didn't see from his right.
[2490.54s -> 2493.54s]  He grabs him by the arm, tackles and rips his arm off.
[2494.90s -> 2496.90s]  And he just looks over and starts screaming at his arm.
[2497.90s -> 2498.90s]  That's now just a socket.
[2500.98s -> 2504.46s]  Countdown goes down to zero.
[2505.46s -> 2506.70s]  You lose the game.
[2508.26s -> 2521.59s]  You didn't go fast enough.
[2522.59s -> 2523.59s]  Roll the credits.
[2524.59s -> 2525.59s]  And as the credits are rolling, like he's getting put on a stretcher.
[2526.59s -> 2527.59s]  And like the coach is seen.
[2529.09s -> 2530.09s]  Was betting on the other team.
[2531.09s -> 2532.65s]  It's like, what the fuck is that?
[2533.65s -> 2534.65s]  Hold on.
[2535.65s -> 2536.65s]  What's going on over there?
[2536.65s -> 2537.65s]  He's playing with the other coach.
[2539.46s -> 2540.46s]  He put him in.
[2541.46s -> 2543.60s]  Okay, that's weird.
[2544.60s -> 2545.60s]  The credits keep going down.
[2547.93s -> 2550.93s]  After like another 30 seconds of credits, there's a school board meeting.
[2551.93s -> 2553.23s]  For like the college.
[2554.54s -> 2557.54s]  And they're shutting down the sports program.
[2558.54s -> 2561.54s]  Not enough money came in this year because of that horrible loss for the college.
[2578.90s -> 2579.90s]  That's not how school funding works.
[2580.90s -> 2609.55s]  If you lose a monster football tournament.
[2610.55s -> 2621.33s]  Oh, I got another one of these.
[2622.33s -> 2624.33s]  You need a psychopath so you can take all the glory yourself.
[2625.33s -> 2629.81s]  Now you're thinking, now you're thinking with portals.
[2634.63s -> 2635.63s]  These monsters are so easy to cut through.
[2643.02s -> 2650.59s]  All right, five, what do we get?
[2656.25s -> 2661.01s]  That's it?
[2662.01s -> 2663.01s]  I don't think you get anything for level five.
[2669.94s -> 2670.94s]  Not even flex tape.
[2671.94s -> 2695.78s]  Please no portal spoilers.
[2698.23s -> 2699.23s]  I'm sorry.
[2700.23s -> 2706.34s]  I didn't mean to.
[2707.34s -> 2708.34s]  Most of the items you find in this dungeon, you give to your monsters.
[2709.34s -> 2710.34s]  Later on, items need to be appraised.
[2711.34s -> 2712.34s]  Then used in fusions.
[2720.36s -> 2721.36s]  That mist, how?
[2734.57s -> 2735.57s]  You need to milk rumor before he died.
[2736.57s -> 2738.51s]  No.
[2739.51s -> 2744.02s]  You can't do that in this game.
[2745.02s -> 2746.02s]  I just want to get him to level five but it seems like he didn't get anything.
[2759.67s -> 2760.67s]  Why do I keep, I don't know guys.
[2761.67s -> 2762.67s]  I wish I could tell you why I read those.
[2764.94s -> 2765.94s]  It just kind of is there.
[2767.56s -> 2768.56s]  As a one hit kill.
[2771.14s -> 2773.14s]  I just, I look over and I see it and it's just, oh okay.
[2776.37s -> 2777.37s]  One guy.
[2785.39s -> 2786.39s]  Read the good boy messages for once.
[2787.39s -> 2788.39s]  All right.
[2789.39s -> 2793.63s]  I'm no longer going to read those messages that come up about like milking people.
[2796.34s -> 2797.34s]  So don't even try.
[2812.34s -> 2823.61s]  I really love your stuff by the way, have you?
[2824.61s -> 2826.17s]  Pretty good try.
[2830.29s -> 2831.29s]  Damn, okay.
[2838.42s -> 2847.66s]  97 damage.
[2848.66s -> 2849.66s]  Do you like the TV show The Venture Brothers?
[2851.41s -> 2853.35s]  Yeah, it's a good show.
[2854.35s -> 2855.91s]  It was fun, funny.
[2856.91s -> 2857.91s]  Didn't they bring it back for like a special season or something?
[2858.91s -> 2859.91s]  Or is it actually back now forever?
[2860.91s -> 2868.74s]  They're still making episodes.
[2869.74s -> 2874.06s]  It never ended.
[2875.06s -> 2877.06s]  Didn't it go on like a hiatus for six years or something?
[2878.06s -> 2882.62s]  More than that.
[2883.62s -> 2884.62s]  It was a long time ago.
[2889.00s -> 2890.00s]  Nobody stands a chance.
[2891.00s -> 2901.01s]  152 damage.
[2902.01s -> 2904.72s]  I just, I don't belong here.
[2905.72s -> 2913.23s]  Almost level six though.
[2914.23s -> 2915.23s]  All right, can anybody help me with the...
[2918.01s -> 2919.01s]  Hasn't every Adult Swim show been canceled at some point?
[2920.01s -> 2921.01s]  Yeah.
[2926.28s -> 2927.28s]  Adult Swim is such a weird network.
[2928.28s -> 2930.97s]  Because they just like kind of throw spaghetti into the ceiling.
[2931.97s -> 2940.38s]  And then sometimes a piece will stick.
[2941.38s -> 2942.38s]  All right, what about the other monsters?
[2945.02s -> 2948.63s]  Roberto can't help you, but what about the other ones?
[2949.63s -> 2950.63s]  Can the bunny do something here?
[2950.63s -> 2953.86s]  What about Prover?
[2965.02s -> 2968.70s]  But I think some of my, probably some of my favorite shows,
[2969.70s -> 2974.57s]  at least back when I watched TV every day were on Adult Swim,
[2975.57s -> 2985.51s]  there were some really good shows.
[2986.51s -> 2990.82s]  I have like four of those.
[2991.82s -> 2996.58s]  I hate Prover so much.
[2997.58s -> 2998.58s]  Don't you understand?
[2999.58s -> 3011.13s]  Well, just wait for the football game.
[3012.13s -> 3013.13s]  Please, no.
[3014.43s -> 3015.43s]  That was too dark.
[3018.02s -> 3019.02s]  Get in there.
[3020.02s -> 3021.02s]  Really? You're a little bunny rabbit and you can't go in a little bunny rabbit hole.
[3021.02s -> 3022.02s]  Wait, we have to see the animation.
[3033.43s -> 3034.43s]  What happened?
[3035.43s -> 3041.09s]  Did you hear that?
[3048.02s -> 3049.02s]  You have the least offensive walk.
[3050.02s -> 3051.02s]  Sound and animation.
[3063.66s -> 3064.66s]  Offensive, yeah, like offensive to my ears.
[3065.66s -> 3069.97s]  660 points.
[3070.97s -> 3074.32s]  There are too many bats.
[3075.32s -> 3076.32s]  Yeah, there are.
[3077.32s -> 3078.32s]  Yeah, there are.
[3082.57s -> 3083.57s]  Languages are so weird.
[3087.24s -> 3088.24s]  There are.
[3089.24s -> 3090.24s]  I just said the same word.
[3091.24s -> 3093.06s]  English is so hard to understand.
[3094.06s -> 3095.06s]  Oh, they're over there.
[3096.06s -> 3097.06s]  What did you say?
[3112.38s -> 3113.38s]  Let's see what the bunny can do.
[3114.38s -> 3115.38s]  One damage.
[3116.38s -> 3117.38s]  Wait, what's this? Is this a scream?
[3118.68s -> 3119.68s]  This is a scream.
[3122.14s -> 3123.14s]  This is bunny Pogchamp.
[3124.14s -> 3125.14s]  You guys want to be able to enable Pog?
[3126.14s -> 3128.40s]  There it is.
[3135.08s -> 3136.08s]  I can't even go.
[3140.84s -> 3141.84s]  Back up and do it.
[3142.84s -> 3143.84s]  I can't move back to have me back it up.
[3144.84s -> 3146.14s]  Here we go.
[3147.14s -> 3148.14s]  It's called Muhaha.
[3154.50s -> 3155.50s]  Muhaha.
[3156.50s -> 3168.05s]  What?
[3169.05s -> 3170.05s]  Oh, this is.
[3171.05s -> 3172.93s]  How much damage?
[3175.51s -> 3179.76s]  Weak.
[3180.76s -> 3183.47s]  What about, let's bring in the plant.
[3185.10s -> 3186.10s]  Prove it.
[3187.59s -> 3188.59s]  You got Pecking and Joseph Pollen.
[3189.96s -> 3193.57s]  Joseph Pollen.
[3194.57s -> 3195.57s]  Pretty sick move.
[3196.57s -> 3204.98s]  Pretty sick move.
[3205.98s -> 3210.74s]  Sorry, I just screamed at you.
[3212.10s -> 3213.10s]  Golden Foot.
[3214.34s -> 3215.34s]  Sniper.
[3216.34s -> 3222.38s]  Probably better for the Pollen attack.
[3223.38s -> 3224.38s]  Well, he does have high intelligence, so that helps.
[3230.42s -> 3231.42s]  Another sword.
[3232.42s -> 3235.46s]  Yeah.
[3236.89s -> 3237.89s]  Let's see.
[3238.89s -> 3241.78s]  Bunny's traits are.
[3242.78s -> 3244.78s]  Power moves that use the feet and do just damage, but it's harder to dodge.
[3245.78s -> 3248.72s]  And the traits for Prover are.
[3249.72s -> 3250.72s]  Magic Lore.
[3251.96s -> 3254.96s]  Ups magic power and lets you add a magic to skill.
[3255.96s -> 3257.97s]  I still don't know what that means.
[3258.97s -> 3260.97s]  And then Sniper and Pheromone.
[3261.97s -> 3262.97s]  Increase power moves that use charm.
[3263.97s -> 3264.97s]  It's like a charm enemies.
[3264.97s -> 3278.53s]  What do you guys think is the hardest English sentence to remotely understand for someone that does not speak it?
[3279.53s -> 3287.10s]  It's got to be something with the words that sound exactly the same, but mean different things.
[3288.10s -> 3305.25s]  Follow German985 on Twitch is the hardest thing to understand.
[3306.25s -> 3309.28s]  Buffalo?
[3310.28s -> 3313.06s]  What do you mean, Buffalo?
[3316.92s -> 3317.92s]  That's the hardest word to understand?
[3326.39s -> 3327.39s]  He doesn't know.
[3328.39s -> 3341.02s]  No, I don't.
[3342.02s -> 3343.02s]  I don't know what that means.
[3346.95s -> 3347.95s]  Well, don't let him die.
[3348.95s -> 3350.96s]  Pull him out quick.
[3351.96s -> 3352.96s]  Pull him out.
[3353.96s -> 3354.96s]  Pull him out.
[3356.46s -> 3357.46s]  Bring in Roberto.
[3358.46s -> 3361.87s]  I don't want anybody dying.
[3366.50s -> 3367.50s]  Wikipedia.
[3368.50s -> 3369.50s]  There's a Wikipedia article for the word Buffalo.
[3370.50s -> 3371.50s]  It's like eight times.
[3374.28s -> 3385.28s]  It's a grammatically correct sentence in American English, often presented as an example of how homonyms and homophones can be used to create complicated linguistic constructs through lexical ambiguity.
[3385.28s -> 3390.28s]  It has been discussed in literature in various forms when it appeared in Beyond Language Adventures in Word and Thought.
[3391.28s -> 3415.98s]  The sentence employs three distinct meanings of the word Buffalo as a proper noun to refer to a specific place named Buffalo, the city of Buffalo, New York, as a verb meaning to bully, harass, or intimidate, as a noun to refer to the animal more easily decoded, though semantically equivalent would be bison from buffalo.
[3415.98s -> 3420.15s]  That other bison from buffalo bully themselves, bully bison from buffalo.
[3428.15s -> 3436.62s]  But that's not.
[3442.62s -> 3443.62s]  All right, I'm done.
[3445.30s -> 3446.30s]  I'm not, I don't want to read that anymore.
[3447.30s -> 3452.36s]  But that's not a sentence.
[3452.36s -> 3466.22s]  turn slash nice but about I mean it is a sentence but those are just words you
[3466.22s -> 3473.87s]  just it's just Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo it's a noun verb in an adjective that's
[3473.87s -> 3487.52s]  a stupid Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo
[3487.52s -> 3512.70s]  yeah but you don't say Buffalo from Buffalo that's right you say Buffalo
[3512.70s -> 3521.42s]  Buffalo how late to my how late am I to the party here
[3521.42s -> 3536.09s]  word bump any word is weird when you say it let's say pick a word okay I'm gonna
[3536.09s -> 3542.01s]  use the word mosquito okay when you say a word that many times you think about a
[3542.01s -> 3547.97s]  word that many times it becomes so strange mosquito mosquito mosquito
[3547.97s -> 3560.84s]  mosquito mosquito that doesn't sound right now the speed is too much just
[3560.84s -> 3576.29s]  instantly please this is like probably there's like 2,700 people here I bet you
[3576.29s -> 3584.66s]  anything 2,000 of you want me to stop this conversation and 400 of you just
[3584.66s -> 3612.16s]  said the same word like ten times and went what the fuck James well John had
[3612.16s -> 3620.81s]  had had had had had had had had but nobody talks like that you know he
[3620.81s -> 3627.22s]  actually speaks the way that is written semantic say see say semantic
[3627.22s -> 3632.04s]  satiation if that's not like a real sentence but that's not you wouldn't
[3632.08s -> 3642.04s]  have a conversation like that with somebody if somebody was talking like
[3642.04s -> 3648.66s]  that on the subway you'd move two seats to the right you'd be like I don't know
[3648.66s -> 3657.60s]  this person's fucking kind of crazy John had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had you'd be
[3657.60s -> 3678.50s]  like move down a few seats it's a hundred percent grammatically perfect
[3678.50s -> 3693.90s]  and that's the point you're missing the point don't hurt yourself trying to
[3694.30s -> 3698.30s]  no I get it I know it's like a complete grammatical sentence but I'm talking
[3698.30s -> 3703.58s]  about if somebody was learning English you wouldn't a difficult sentence for
[3703.58s -> 3708.10s]  them to understand would not be John had had had had had had had had had had had
[3708.10s -> 3712.70s]  had had had had had had had right I'm talking about like a sentence that you
[3712.70s -> 3723.24s]  would see in like everyday life that's not a goalpost move that's like that's
[3723.24s -> 3776.25s]  not and nobody has that conversation final guts this topics fucking sucks is
[3776.25s -> 3800.95s]  it not really it's not really a topic as much as it's a question but can be
[3800.95s -> 3812.94s]  understood through I'm not reading it I'm not gonna read it no I've already
[3812.94s -> 3833.63s]  read two of them Buffalo had had had had Buffalo had Chad what what is this
[3833.63s -> 3854.25s]  that's it I beat it so I got a new move for I was almost gonna say Chad let's
[3854.25s -> 3872.99s]  take a look there's a calm turn slash life damage a cut into is also a this
[3873.03s -> 3878.62s]  takes 30 guts this takes 20 so a little bit more to use it accuracy see
[3878.62s -> 3885.84s]  accuracy ease more accurate mid-range so it's it's kind of better than cutting
[3885.84s -> 3894.10s]  too it just takes more to use but that's fine I'd rather use that to be honest
[3894.10s -> 3902.15s]  does the same amount of damage and hits more often but just time it better with
[3902.15s -> 3909.43s]  the guts then you get something else to somebody else somebody get something
[3909.43s -> 3921.24s]  else all right you like golden sword and honey you don't like honey toast you
[3921.24s -> 3928.70s]  like sleep and you don't like to fight I told you this is the worst let's see it

[5014.34s -> 5044.35s]  time I don't even know if you guys could hear that but I tried try another scene
[5065.20s -> 5068.68s]  I just the reason why this is funny to me is I imagine somebody in the gym with
[5068.68s -> 5075.39s]  a playlist with this shit on their playlist why would you have this on a
[5075.39s -> 5081.29s]  playlist this is something that you listen to you are fucked you are fucked

[5367.48s -> 5373.62s]  oh somebody farting oh harder than secure is a hard thing this is like the
[5373.62s -> 5392.96s]  hard thing challenge no that's it I can't go back oh I can't go back I look

[6759.09s -> 6764.16s]  where I like devolve into like the computer generated person and then I
[6764.16s -> 6780.14s]  turn into this you guys are so quick with this shit it's fucking hilarious
[6780.14s -> 6797.17s]  okay I this is too much fun that is real this is what's really going to
[6797.17s -> 6812.04s]  happen I want you to remember this I will look like this exactly it's gonna
[6812.04s -> 6878.96s]  be completely the same oh fuck wrong thing this doesn't work like this I got
[6878.96s -> 6953.41s]  it hold on almost there is the evolution this evolution of my boy yeah so all
[6953.41s -> 6956.97s]  right you got this is what like dad okay I got it this is what dad looked like
[6956.97s -> 6964.63s]  when he was in college and then dad you know met your mother and then they had
[6964.63s -> 6970.87s]  children and this is like you about my boys are growing up there they are my
[6970.87s -> 6975.83s]  boys and girls are both growing up getting older riding the bike for the
[6975.83s -> 6987.77s]  first time changing diapers move on to here he proposed he proposed to her my
[6987.77s -> 6994.99s]  back hurts I can't really mow the lawn anymore I might actually get I'm gonna
[6994.99s -> 6999.15s]  get to see my grandson and my granddaughter get married I can't believe
[7000.33s -> 7006.08s]  here's the day of the wedding they got married they actually did and all the
[7006.08s -> 7013.63s]  work I've put in over the decades of time finally gonna see my son and my
[7013.63s -> 7027.22s]  daughter no no no like they have two kids and they both marry different
[7027.22s -> 7061.35s]  people guys no these have to be flipped because this is like young this is like
[7061.35s -> 7074.26s]  16 year old this is like dad in college this is dad when he's a teenager I think
[7074.70s -> 7112.93s]  okay schedule I'm fucking believable so we need to rest every Roberto has a
[7112.93s -> 7118.58s]  tournament today rest rest we're good everyone's gonna gonna feed everybody
[7118.58s -> 7127.94s]  that's good plus almost nine defense from Roberto it's funny because the
[7127.94s -> 7132.30s]  title of this dream is splicing DNA on the ranch and that's kind of what we
[7132.30s -> 7143.08s]  were just we're doing with me so we got a tournament today cool okay
[7143.08s -> 7175.80s]  tournament today okay sorry I had to take a second today's the day for
[7175.80s -> 7188.45s]  Roberto I gotta feed Roberto food squid you like squid don't you I'm gonna move
[7188.45s -> 7199.87s]  this I'm you can't continue like nothing happened look that was the
[7199.87s -> 7207.99s]  intermission the stream goes on that was like the episode 2 of stream Monster
[7207.99s -> 7220.96s]  Rancher stream to speed the rabbit potato that was an exhausting intermission
[7220.96s -> 7228.55s]  yeah there's all of it how many do you have German thick that's not part of the
[7228.55s -> 7239.64s]  family that what if I just filled out every one of my last emotes lots with
[7239.64s -> 7246.72s]  those what dog shit what a terrible channel this would be imagine if like
[7246.72s -> 7258.68s]  half of my emotes were just all those images all right Roberto let's stomp it
[7258.68s -> 7268.32s]  mean the planets that put the planets at least have like a transparency
[7268.32s -> 7273.96s]  background it's not just clips of my foam in the
[7273.96s -> 7290.12s]  background that was something else all right Roberto versus Fiddler let's take
[7290.12s -> 7303.89s]  a look at the enemy here it's gonna be with one hit kill or two hit kill
[7303.89s -> 7314.24s]  why like stunk fucking hurts yeah that's audio foam yeah that's the new
[7314.24s -> 7344.85s]  move turn slash it's really good he's so good he's really so good he's got BBS
[7344.85s -> 7357.87s]  colors of course he's good no we're gonna just win instantly could it be
[7357.87s -> 7371.91s]  sweet Ryan definitely I think so key ready one two three he's too good that
[7371.95s -> 7378.48s]  move is so good it's just it is a one hit kill on 90% of everybody we got to
[7378.48s -> 7383.28s]  get him up quick before he dies I'm gonna just do tournaments with Roberto
[7383.28s -> 7406.27s]  get him to like rank B and a this thing is terrible just kill it whoa how do you
[7406.27s -> 7414.35s]  get one of these how do you get one of the big dogs I would love one of these
[7414.35s -> 7428.28s]  big dogs risk of rain two is out yeah I think actually I think me and it's out
[7428.28s -> 7440.68s]  because I'm gonna play that one in a couple days looks fun it is an a rank
[7440.68s -> 7451.13s]  unlock cool 1500 gold eight more fame Roberto getting popular it's very good
[7451.13s -> 7459.63s]  cool peaceful Haley five community subs from peaceful Haley thank you Haley five
[7459.63s -> 7468.00s]  community subs thank you that means a lot thanks all thank you so much
[7468.00s -> 7474.01s]  oh there's another image if people want me to click on I guess I guess I'll do

[7520.14s -> 7537.46s]  to the five community subs thank you oh god that one with like my eyebrows up my
[7537.94s -> 7545.92s]  let's get you intelligence training are you tired now you get and let's get you
[7545.92s -> 7553.92s]  some acts yeah accuracy training and then you sandbag training and then rest
[7553.92s -> 7557.96s]  and then light blade twice sounds good and then I'm also gonna make sure you
[7557.96s -> 7568.89s]  sign up for the next possible tournament which is where's it this one right here
[7568.89s -> 7573.93s]  Roberto get it and then the official tournament is the next two days afterwards
[7573.93s -> 7592.32s]  uh I can't like play when shit like this is in the chat you know how difficult
[7592.32s -> 7595.80s]  it is for me to like focus on this video game when this is in the chat over and
[7595.80s -> 7614.07s]  over again what image is this and why is it still in the background no let's go
[7614.07s -> 7625.70s]  all right he signed up for it his training is gonna be yeah so he's going
[7625.70s -> 7635.44s]  today all of them are doing something not bad everybody's pretty good how are
[7635.48s -> 7643.01s]  you doing you got tournament you need to eat tired praise you're doing great you're
[7643.01s -> 7653.27s]  actually doing a great job and I'll feed you too because you're hungry give a
[7653.27s -> 7663.58s]  squid gotta feed the robot yeah for some reason you're gonna sleep before the
[7663.58s -> 7684.03s]  tournament and you need to eat too I'll give you a squid lively and you are
[7684.03s -> 7695.32s]  tired though so to bed is this better than Monster Rancher 2 ah that's it's
[7695.32s -> 7704.58s]  hard to say so he's gonna rest today they both I like Monster Rancher 2's
[7705.06s -> 7712.24s]  minigame system better because this is kind of just numbers on the screen
[7712.24s -> 7717.39s]  whereas you got to actually see the fun little animation play out and and
[7717.39s -> 7720.63s]  although they were they were repetitive it was still fun to see them all right
[7720.63s -> 7727.11s]  we can buy something maybe here what will you do I can I buy a bigger house
[7727.11s -> 7735.16s]  like blade tub trampoline target book sandbag what am I missing trampoline
[7735.16s -> 7744.10s]  target I have no I have it all how do I buy a bigger house praise anything
[7744.10s -> 7753.83s]  customize is there a way I can custom I can buy a bigger house I do have to win
[7753.83s -> 7776.37s]  more tournaments it's another corn emote what am I missing another yeah there's
[7776.37s -> 7784.09s]  like 10 or 12 corn emotes flying around can't really do anything
[7791.72s -> 7799.81s]  all right calendar we've got another tournament here almost ready to get out
[7799.81s -> 7812.19s]  of D rank and to see rank hopefully you can do some some accuracy training you
[7812.19s -> 7823.95s]  can do some more like we need some more help on you who cares rest and then your
[7823.95s -> 7838.22s]  tournament sounds good begin well that's terrible some people have all
[7838.22s -> 7848.76s]  their whole channels emotes corn related how the hell would you do that
[7849.16s -> 7857.94s]  that's almost as dumb as having him be completely planet related like every
[7857.94s -> 7864.92s]  emotes a planet just like a royalty-free NASA image with like your face on it
[7864.92s -> 7871.39s]  from like a picture you took at Blizzcon like four and a half years ago I mean
[7877.63s -> 7886.04s]  you can eat too I know you don't like bananas but do you know do you like
[7886.04s -> 7901.09s]  bananas let me see get Roberto in their steam role another time yeah steam roll
[7901.09s -> 7906.86s]  another competition and then we can finally climb out of this dumb rank
[7906.86s -> 7913.79s]  German says he won't read gross messages but spends an hour crying at a fart joke
[7913.79s -> 7918.47s]  it wasn't the fact that it was a fart it was the fact that it was loud and it was
[7918.47s -> 7923.43s]  the whole scenario it wasn't just the fart that I thought was funny it was the
[7923.43s -> 7929.09s]  entire bowl soup it wasn't just the carrots it was the lentils it was the
[7929.09s -> 7934.28s]  kale it was the broth the whole bowl soup was hilarious to me
[7934.28s -> 7940.46s]  Freudian weapon thanks for 10 bucks no 10 bucks 10 community subs not 10 bucks
[7940.46s -> 7948.68s]  that's way more than $10 Freudian coming in 10 community subs thanks for 10
[7948.68s -> 7964.92s]  bucks thank you Freudian 10 community subs rolling it did I just described
[7964.92s -> 7969.88s]  farts like a bowl soup no I described the whole scenario as many ingredients
[7969.88s -> 7974.40s]  into why I thought that was that funny German is a mature streamer that's I'm
[7974.40s -> 7981.97s]  not gonna it's all right by the way this is a fluffy dog rumor that's actually
[7981.97s -> 7993.95s]  pretty cool turnslash and just wait bingo Roberto
[7993.95s -> 8007.40s]  maybe I should just build up I think I'm just gonna oh okay for Roberto now I'm
[8007.40s -> 8012.88s]  just gonna build accuracy and power and just try to beat the complete glass
[8012.88s -> 8017.48s]  cannon where you have you just have really high chance to hit and just try
[8017.48s -> 8031.08s]  to kill things in one or two hits preferably one hit opponent quit afraid
[8031.08s -> 8039.60s]  of Roberto holiday versus they're all the same monster I got this in the back
[8040.08s -> 8053.13s]  I still have this corn on my monitor gets out of here every time I close a
[8053.13s -> 8056.77s]  window there's another fucked up image that I have to see I have like 10 tabs
[8056.77s -> 8071.46s]  open that's it one almost one hit it's okay what is a higher hit percent chance
[8071.46s -> 8091.16s]  slash does well I missed the kick no that's not good no that's not good at
[8091.16s -> 8098.47s]  all all right back it up getting close now closer closer closer closer
[8098.63s -> 8118.61s]  all right that's why I got to build up accuracy and power you run into a
[8118.61s -> 8124.26s]  scenario where I'm just gonna burn through guts and lose what I get the
[8124.26s -> 8131.33s]  money yeah the dashing is what did it but I just didn't want to get in range I
[8131.33s -> 8152.06s]  got a peach cool Roberto getting pretty popular almost 50 so then let's take a
[8152.06s -> 8157.70s]  look at the calendar you got official tournament here or Roberto let's get him in
[8157.70s -> 8169.51s]  tip-top shape we have two cycles to work with today let me see 228 power I
[8169.51s -> 8172.67s]  got to get that accuracy up German a lot about Minecraft VR thanks to five
[8172.67s -> 8181.02s]  community subs more community subs rolling in thank you guys more community
[8181.02s -> 8190.98s]  sub drops you guys are very generous thank you accuracy and speed are
[8190.98s -> 8205.38s]  probably what I need to do accuracy speed and power so let's take this get
[8205.42s -> 8216.76s]  life out of here accuracy speed let's do accuracy twice and then we'll rest before
[8216.76s -> 8223.78s]  the tournament he's tired he's tired we'll do we'll rest now and then we'll
[8223.78s -> 8234.27s]  do two days of accuracy training that should be good what about you guys you
[8234.35s -> 8241.94s]  let's get you into yeah let me just even look up you guys are just useless so who
[8241.94s -> 8250.46s]  cares your life your intelligence a great power act but you're not gonna be
[8250.46s -> 8256.48s]  doing back accuracy and defense probably important let's just do accuracy and
[8256.48s -> 8263.40s]  intelligence then or this is good intelligence like over 200 or defense
[8264.04s -> 8281.17s]  I'm gonna say defense defense book is fine and then what about you kind of
[8281.17s -> 8285.44s]  balanced all the way around except your health is terrible uh I'm gonna say
[8285.44s -> 8293.26s]  health and speed or health and accuracy let's just do health a couple times what
[8293.26s -> 8298.62s]  does intelligence improve it improves magic damage any move that is a green
[8298.62s -> 8302.58s]  move not a yellow move yellow is based on power green is based on intelligence
[8302.58s -> 8308.78s]  so it makes you do more damage with your green based intelligence based moves
[8308.78s -> 8313.90s]  and I believe it also increases your defense to those moves as well at least
[8313.90s -> 8319.12s]  I think that's what it was like in the second game yeah it's like magic resist
[8319.12s -> 8326.00s]  because defense does not help with magic damage I don't think I think that's good
[8326.00s -> 8336.38s]  you just need health right health and health
[8336.38s -> 8350.23s]  your health is terrible all right good night not reasoned by very much
[8350.23s -> 8361.52s]  tired you can rest tomorrow frustrated oh no wait how are you doing lively good
[8361.52s -> 8378.47s]  have a potato what flavor mushroom is that lemon lime that's a sprite flavored
[8378.47s -> 8395.32s]  mushroom oh sorry a surge flavored mushroom it's probably more accurate so
[8395.32s -> 8406.35s]  the tournaments tomorrow right here so I got a couple of days you killed Wally
[8406.35s -> 8418.48s]  no I had to I had to do it all right you're frustrated so you don't do anything
[8418.48s -> 8443.34s]  today rest and then book you are tired so rest and then like blade you are
[8443.34s -> 8453.21s]  going to target training and then maybe target training again go for it that was
[8453.21s -> 8462.24s]  really good plus 12 into accuracy and we doing it tomorrow as well good work
[8462.24s -> 8482.10s]  anybody else need anything I think everyone's asleep yeah you're good next
[8482.10s -> 8491.22s]  day next week competition is one more day nobody can join this one so I can't
[8491.78s -> 8501.77s]  do it this will hopefully get us to see I really hope so because that'd be the
[8501.77s -> 8506.23s]  first time we've been able to do it I'm getting carried by Roberto oh yeah
[8506.23s -> 8514.62s]  absolutely so you can probably do this training and be fine yeah and I'll just
[8514.62s -> 8533.54s]  feed you you'll be fine you're lively okay not bad please don't be tired nice
[8533.54s -> 8543.19s]  okay good have some good food we're gonna give you a oh I wonder if I should
[8543.19s -> 8546.97s]  give him an energy bar no this is too expensive maybe I'll just give it to
[8546.97s -> 8557.74s]  him so I can guarantee myself yeah I'm gonna give it to him take this and get
[8557.74s -> 8581.04s]  us into rank C he's good Roberto's gonna get addicted to energy bars fuse him
[8581.04s -> 8590.57s]  before he dies his genes are too good to lose I'll make sure all right we got a
[8590.61s -> 8597.90s]  bullshit ending on the last time we did this by Calabrino last standing like
[8597.90s -> 8607.93s]  three times my stats are really really good I have amazing moves this is just
[8607.93s -> 8617.50s]  high intelligence watch out for the int attacks I gave myself some more
[8617.50s -> 8633.64s]  accuracy this should help a lot he's already starting up good block get in
[8633.64s -> 8636.27s]  there get in there don't let him do anything
[8636.27s -> 8642.96s]  all right all right I'm gonna stick with this just a regular slash does so
[8642.96s -> 8652.13s]  much damage just twice if you can start it off with that turn slash move the
[8652.13s -> 8655.85s]  jumping one then you're good to go but if you don't get it first I'm not gonna
[8655.85s -> 8666.62s]  do it again because it takes 30 guts not a good idea Roberto currently is
[8666.62s -> 8671.96s]  probably gonna live to three and a half years old energy bars boosts and remove
[8671.96s -> 8677.10s]  some of the remaining time alive yeah that's good to know so energy bars
[8677.10s -> 8680.97s]  actually take years off of their life
[8684.68s -> 8692.42s]  state pretty much balanced across the board except no power and no defense
[8692.42s -> 8715.10s]  really stay away from the intelligence moves from what it seems and go bye stay
[8715.10s -> 8722.63s]  in close see you guys at rank C cuz that's definitely where we're gonna be
[8722.63s -> 8735.38s]  at the end of this and I'll see you at rank B not long after probably
[8735.82s -> 8744.32s]  most I've not seen so far since playing very many high-power enemies everyone's
[8744.32s -> 8764.37s]  building intelligence for some reason very few high-power enemies all right
[8764.37s -> 8773.40s]  that's all right not good good final guts all right that's annoying
[8773.44s -> 8791.97s]  that's also annoying not good thank God final guts is the worst
[8791.97s -> 8798.26s]  oh is there a way that I wonder there's a move you can get where you just turn
[8798.26s -> 8818.20s]  off their final guts I wonder if there's a stay dead move it always ends in
[8818.20s -> 8824.22s]  Calabrino so I just have to beat everybody here all right here we go high
[8824.22s -> 8829.70s]  power of high life decent speed this is gonna be hard I get it I'm okay I'm not
[8829.86s -> 8835.78s]  gonna do I'm only gonna do slash here because it's the highest accuracy that
[8835.78s -> 8849.34s]  I have he'll dodge everything just getting close that's not a good start
[8849.34s -> 8856.63s]  that's a really bad start just don't even give him a chance again 78% chance
[8856.63s -> 8887.51s]  to hit this got only one more two more fights Roberto versus Calarino round two
[8887.51s -> 8893.96s]  have you improved at all high intelligence low power high health so
[8893.96s -> 8904.94s]  just watch out for the intelligence moves and try to just burn down I'm only
[8904.94s -> 8911.86s]  gonna go for slashes here I already saw that dialogue I already read it in a
[8911.86s -> 8925.58s]  funny voice didn't I all right monitor guts get in close and slash good block
[8925.62s -> 8938.49s]  84% chance to hit this perfect do it again 83% goodbye that was we didn't get
[8938.49s -> 8945.98s]  that was such bullshit last time I did this was two final guts going up to
[8945.98s -> 8960.79s]  rank C Roberto really is just extraordinarily powerful that's why I
[8960.79s -> 8966.18s]  want to try to just grind to rank a so we can unlock some more monsters how
[8966.22s -> 8972.43s]  could I lose to this kid this is just unbelievable whoo two grand of a squid
[8972.43s -> 8998.57s]  Roberto you've done it you brought us into a new ring congratulations Fane I
[8998.57s -> 9005.37s]  had no idea you'd come so far I mean no sorry what it's all right see oh no that
[9005.37s -> 9009.99s]  was me talking it's all right see so I can't even believe that myself I mean
[9009.99s -> 9014.33s]  shoot after I was kicked out of Elvis school I thought that I'd lost my last

[9966.86s -> 9971.04s]  just came to see if we could enter the room competition now listen here this is
[9971.04s -> 9977.07s]  the Fimber headquarters we can't have people coming in without appointments now
[9977.07s -> 9980.47s]  you come again next week and we'll answer any little question that you have
[9980.47s -> 9986.40s]  but for now well the exit is over there it's nothing like the toggle monster
[9986.40s -> 10002.67s]  Association shoot we'll just have to come back next week softlock softlock
[10002.67s -> 10029.02s]  softlocked softlocked softlocked oh I was gonna do it right before coming here
[10029.02s -> 10036.71s]  but the I got distracted oh no I was gonna do it right before coming here but
[10036.75s -> 10041.74s]  I got distracted by the other town and now the game's softlocked itself thank
[10041.74s -> 10047.02s]  fucking God get me back quick oh my goodness that would have been such a
[10047.02s -> 10050.46s]  horrendous end to the stream because of what am I gonna go back and do three
[10050.46s -> 10062.15s]  hours worth of Monster Ranger again get me back there quick that was I didn't
[10062.15s -> 10070.52s]  save one time this whole entire stream look at that that's the walnut is still
[10070.52s -> 10079.61s]  in here guys that was before I even froze walnut and from her
[10079.61s -> 10095.53s]  shit that would have been so bad that was this entire stream almost three
[10095.53s -> 10104.52s]  hours all right let's see how I fare in C rank we got a couple more three or four
[10104.52s -> 10108.46s]  more weeks what are you doing you're resting today yes you're very tired you
[10108.46s -> 10110.42s]  deserve it target training twice and then we'd be
[10110.42s -> 10121.65s]  sandbag training after a rest that's good pretty good recovery why did I
[10121.65s -> 10126.30s]  freeze rumor because we got to the realization that Roberto was the only
[10126.30s -> 10130.12s]  one that was gonna take us through to a higher rank so then we made these two
[10130.12s -> 10135.67s]  assholes that were just kind of funny characters to be side content comic
[10135.67s -> 10143.24s]  relief characters for the main character who is this one and so far I think it's
[10143.24s -> 10151.76s]  worked out pretty well you almost gave me a heart attack with that softlock I
[10151.76s -> 10155.48s]  almost had a heart attack in the chair here playing the game we went in almost
[10155.48s -> 10162.01s]  softlocked or hard I would be a hard lock at that point we can do anybody
[10162.17s -> 10177.52s]  frustrated here just be happy what would you have done if it had actually
[10177.52s -> 10182.64s]  crashed I'm gonna be real with you guys I am having a lot of fun playing this
[10182.64s -> 10185.16s]  and this is like you know the second stream we've done of this game and I'm
[10185.16s -> 10190.44s]  having a good time but that would be so devastating to me that I would probably
[10190.44s -> 10196.68s]  just put in mr. mosquito and maybe I would do off-stream I would just grind
[10196.68s -> 10217.60s]  up and do it again you need to eat okay you should probably eat too you don't
[10217.60s -> 10223.86s]  want potatoes though here have a peach this is like shaped like you you
[10223.86s -> 10238.78s]  probably like it you loved it but adventure is still a toggle
[10238.78s -> 10244.74s]  caves all right let me go back to town and actually inquire about tournaments
[10244.74s -> 10255.54s]  and stuff maybe that's why there's not an official tournament let's see so it
[10255.54s -> 10260.23s]  appears that you attended Elvis school but later dropped out meaning that you
[10260.23s -> 10265.94s]  don't have an official breeder license then you can't enter the competition
[10265.94s -> 10270.64s]  what but I entered the toggle competition just fine according to your
[10270.64s -> 10276.06s]  toggle registration you entered with a recommendation hmm well for local
[10276.06s -> 10278.94s]  competition recommendations from a respected member of the community is
[10278.94s -> 10283.54s]  acceptable but we can't have just anybody entering the top level
[10283.74s -> 10291.13s]  competition hmm but fame is the toggle champion then it shouldn't be a problem
[10291.13s -> 10296.14s]  for him to get a real license now if you would kindly shuffle over to the exit
[10296.14s -> 10301.90s]  all right we need a license shoot we came all this way for nothing what's
[10301.90s -> 10308.50s]  with that I can't believe this I go out on the road for a bit and that little
[10308.50s -> 10316.52s]  brat philia goes and turns into a star what a cruel world TT and she's in a
[10316.52s -> 10322.19s]  very bad mood huh it's you the ones from toggle this is too much I'm going

[11560.65s -> 11580.78s]  accuracy let's just end it not gonna live a lens pretty cool design that's a
[11580.78s -> 11586.56s]  dog with a gigantic binocular in his head one single binocular it's like a
[11586.56s -> 11610.00s]  sniper scope that was a wow 70% chance didn't hit it holy shit easy slow down
[11610.00s -> 11626.54s]  sorry not that much damage went for it I'm gonna wait for my guts to build up
[11626.54s -> 11633.84s]  he's bullish just hang on hang out I'm gonna get this kick take less than
[11633.84s -> 11644.25s]  slash more than slash single one more he's out of guts that hurt but he's out
[11644.25s -> 11663.80s]  of guts it's not good got it so okay everybody has lost one match that means
[11663.80s -> 11680.97s]  it's anybody's game Vinette 225 intelligence actually pretty good across
[11680.97s -> 11705.43s]  the board revenge of the walnut that is just Wally the same exact kind that's
[11705.43s -> 11710.42s]  how you that's what I want to see right off the bat almost 200 damage instantly
[11710.42s -> 11720.13s]  killed that's why we built so much power go back to it more power more accuracy I
[11720.13s -> 11725.11s]  want to build do that every time and you guys were telling me that I shouldn't
[11725.11s -> 11730.22s]  have frozen one three thousand gold in a fish
[11744.70s -> 11759.19s]  okay good work calendar we've got another one of these so I'll sign up for

[11766.43s -> 11774.59s]  that's also the same one in February March Jesus May where's there an
[11774.59s -> 11784.76s]  official tournament there is no official time really
[11784.80s -> 11792.48s]  oh it's cuz I have to get the license I gotta get the license so how much time
[11792.48s -> 11799.22s]  is between there so we got let's take them to the caves and find that healing
[11799.22s -> 11809.47s]  mushroom hopefully then that we can get a license handed to us and then there'll
[11809.47s -> 11812.99s]  be an official tournament hopefully soon after these ones here already signed up
[11812.99s -> 11818.86s]  for this one all right let's go let's take a look we got sandbag now rest and
[11818.86s -> 11828.13s]  then we'll do two sandbags and then rest that's fine that's good you're on
[11828.13s -> 11854.93s]  automatic anyways automatic for speed for technique who's hungry the fish is
[11854.93s -> 11863.64s]  going to you know who I keep trying to give prover a potato and they never
[11863.72s -> 11885.21s]  wanted you think I would have figured that out by now no not yet feed us you
[11885.21s -> 11911.74s]  guys fine all right now you're good sandbag sandbag level 14 power I want
[11911.74s -> 11933.30s]  him to have over 300 attack power sleeping you need to eat yeah I was
[11933.30s -> 11947.12s]  Roberto still alive he's not that old he's not even like a year or two old now
[11947.12s -> 11954.21s]  I'll give you a fish you're probably gonna love it rare in the seas of Togo
[11954.21s -> 11970.19s]  the nice monster tree here feed your guild members how long do they live for
[11970.19s -> 11975.19s]  between I believe between three and five years depending on how you treat them
[11975.19s -> 11982.48s]  how tired they are how your training goes right it's between like three and
[11982.52s -> 11993.57s]  five three and six years you got another tournament here at the sandbag rest
[11993.57s -> 12010.26s]  target that sounds good he's killing it right now did I superglue Wally's mouth
[12010.26s -> 12038.62s]  shut no I just froze him he needs to rest come here one more day how are
[12038.62s -> 12046.33s]  things doing go ahead take a look around what will you do still don't have
[12047.21s -> 12054.81s]  I don't have another level up for these like sandbag hanging punching bag or
[12054.81s -> 12059.45s]  something or weightlifting it has to be a third or fourth level why would you
[12059.45s -> 12064.37s]  stop a little too if I need to find an item or something I'm gonna find those
[12064.37s -> 12080.09s]  tablets right Twitch streamers stroking his ego it's towards stroking his ego
[12080.09s -> 12103.70s]  I go I don't know what you mean by that Lego my ego rest and then target make
[12103.70s -> 12109.76s]  him feed you guys all right you know what here listen everybody relax open up
[12109.76s -> 12116.35s]  your open stream legends if you want it I'm gonna I'm caving here I do this at
[12116.35s -> 12124.35s]  the end of the stream usually extensions stream well we got it open
[12124.75s -> 12154.89s]  ready three two one there you go I wasn't making it up look bro I fucking
[12154.89s -> 12162.39s]  love Monster Rancher well so don't we here we love this franchise here what
[12162.39s -> 12170.00s]  you gonna give what you gonna give us a follow yes and I mean every all three
[12170.00s -> 12183.97s]  thousand nine ninety eight people here now he's good competition two no what is
[12183.97s -> 12198.02s]  it oh it's next week right it's this next week okay you are lively but a
[12198.02s -> 12205.30s]  little hungry you'll be good after this and then your tournament comes up this
[12205.30s -> 12211.28s]  will put a bit around nice plus 13 Roberto has had at least five to six in
[12211.28s -> 12221.41s]  a row more than ten steps all right let's give him some food let's praise him
[12221.41s -> 12224.89s]  too you're doing great you're gonna carry us all the way to be and see an a
[12224.89s -> 12238.02s]  rank feed you a potato I don't have I don't know if you like carrots do you
[12238.02s -> 12252.87s]  like carrots you do this all right Roberto get in there three thousand
[12252.87s -> 12266.96s]  bucks and it's a fish ever so closer to potentially ranking up to be ranked
[12266.96s -> 12279.91s]  Roberto versus Boonin Boonin Boonin has nearly 200 in every step which is
[12279.91s -> 12292.03s]  really good lots of moves hard skin this might be challenging I was a 300
[12292.03s -> 12297.83s]  attack power though speed and intelligence are so bad I don't know if
[12297.83s -> 12314.12s]  that's that's gonna be bad thing for me almost 300 attack horrible cockroach
[12314.12s -> 12322.16s]  dog let's go you know what's gonna happen here right off the bat nice got it
[12322.36s -> 12330.03s]  getting close slash came over you don't have a chance I can't fuck around in
[12330.03s -> 12333.71s]  these because once you get to like C and B you can die in one or two hits so I
[12333.71s -> 12350.65s]  have to make it count I can get one shot by some of these people all right this
[12350.65s -> 12366.41s]  is Tilden Tilden one why that's why my defense is so bad to 202 power it's just
[12366.41s -> 12382.50s]  gonna come down to who gets who hits first essentially all right I have better
[12382.50s -> 12389.62s]  accuracy don't I oh you got it first sorry I'll answer right here fuck not
[12389.62s -> 12396.60s]  good do it again come on don't lose this here come on don't lose it got it nice
[12396.60s -> 12406.24s]  all right now get him a slash quick again 70% all right I was pretty risky
[12406.24s -> 12424.24s]  that's it do pont I guess no I can lose this here if I
[12424.24s -> 12434.00s]  listed du pont how did you lose so many that insane accuracy insane speed and
[12434.00s -> 12448.08s]  high and terrible health though that's probably 125 health do you pond this
[12448.08s -> 12462.95s]  should be one hit see if I can get it so good I just build power and accuracy
[12462.95s -> 12471.14s]  and I can just always open with that move and win that strategy might not
[12471.14s -> 12474.30s]  work getting into rank B and rank a but at least I'll get there
[12474.30s -> 12494.58s]  Alberto is almost too famous almost 100 fame all right so now we're gonna save
[12494.58s -> 12504.85s]  the game rest up a little and then go in the cave
[12513.84s -> 12519.76s]  schedule so we've got everyone's tired let's just have this be a day of rest
[12519.76s -> 12529.44s]  for everybody and then you're going full-on sandbag sandbag accuracy
[12529.44s -> 12532.44s]  accuracy
[12536.13s -> 12550.94s]  all right everybody go to bed food has to go around here it's very hungry
[12551.94s -> 12565.26s]  yeah these guys are just bait to go do the adventure mode
[12566.78s -> 12574.82s]  all right I'm out of food hates carrots hates potatoes hates carrots hates
[12574.82s -> 12580.34s]  but I can't know I'm sorry I think it's time for you to go into the fucking yeah
[12580.34s -> 12587.00s]  I'm sorry you you you suck you're too hard to deal with we'll get a new
[12587.00s -> 12597.72s]  monster you're fine you're good to go Roberto hates Jeremy I remember that
[12597.72s -> 12610.81s]  that was so fun all right weekend activities let's go find the mushroom
[12614.00s -> 12635.41s]  crush it right now not yet so you're trying to healing mushroom I want
[12635.41s -> 12662.90s]  Roberto to get all the experience here did you beat Sekiro actually I did not
[12662.90s -> 12667.58s]  I got to the chained ogre and lost a hundred and forty five times and
[12667.58s -> 12684.70s]  decided the games probably wasn't for me so I just moved on it was so good it
[12684.70s -> 12694.92s]  really is these enemies are nothing now well energized leveled up to level 3
[12694.92s -> 12708.89s]  hard head and on show okay can I do anything with this Roberto's almost
[12708.89s -> 12712.81s]  level six or seven hopefully he gets something else
[12712.81s -> 12728.32s]  come on mushroom all right maybe another couple random encounters so Roberto can
[12728.32s -> 12739.77s]  level up have you beaten ender dragon in minecraft yet no but what happened was I
[12739.77s -> 12744.01s]  actually I got to a point in minecraft I started it and found out the game just
[12744.01s -> 12748.45s]  kind of wasn't for me I got to a creeper and it exploded and I died to a creeper
[12748.45s -> 12751.65s]  like ten times in a row and I was like I just don't think I can it's the games
[12751.65s -> 12769.77s]  are for me so stop playing that's actually true is it though almost level
[12769.77s -> 12780.88s]  seven come on did you ever beat Saxton Hale in team fortress 2 well no because
[12780.88s -> 12788.16s]  I opened up TF2 for the first time and I'm I'm of the opinion that a first
[12788.16s -> 12791.80s]  person shooter should not have somebody that can kill you instantly from behind
[12791.80s -> 12795.24s]  so I got back stabbed and I was like what this is not even a fucking first
[12795.24s -> 12813.80s]  person shooter and I got like irritated so the games just kind of off of me
[12813.80s -> 12821.64s]  hundred and seventy seven damage can I go to a different cave did you ever
[12821.64s -> 12827.14s]  graduate from high school well now what happened was I got to high school and
[12827.14s -> 12830.42s]  it was in ninth grade and I've just I couldn't do it the geometry was way too
[12830.42s -> 12834.35s]  hard so I just said like yeah fuck it is kind of not for me so I just didn't do
[12834.35s -> 12843.56s]  it I stopped high school you know just nothing level seven nothing at level
[12843.72s -> 12874.35s]  seven why really at that's kind of dumb it's like a long time to get there you
[12874.35s -> 12890.21s]  can dodge one you can dodge two but you can't dodge three you're dead yeah I
[12890.21s -> 12899.40s]  gotta get to a new zone this experience is not good enough for Roberto uh explore
[12899.40s -> 12903.60s]  everything I feel like I have to find the mushroom I feel like is it a cut
[12903.60s -> 12918.67s]  scene thing or could I have missed it here I was watching a different streamer
[12918.67s -> 12926.19s]  last night and somebody asked in Chad if they died to pinwheel if you even if
[12926.19s -> 12931.79s]  you die to pinwheel that's all right that's not even a big deal why is that
[12931.79s -> 12937.11s]  some super unforgivable sin if you die to pinwheel in Dark Souls what if you
[12937.11s -> 12941.95s]  happen to have like an itchy ass when you go into the encounter I don't know
[12941.95s -> 12945.03s]  maybe you put your controller down because you didn't the cutscene came up
[12945.03s -> 12957.68s]  and you went to go grab like a snack or cheese it's or something maybe you just
[12957.68s -> 12980.73s]  got unlucky and you just got hit I don't know it's not such a good deal they
[12980.73s -> 13003.35s]  didn't even have a chance it's not like losing to the divine dragon Roberto can't
[13003.35s -> 13012.44s]  help you investigate this any I don't this part I don't understand this who
[13012.44s -> 13017.32s]  can help me investigate these things do you have to be like a water monster or
[13017.32s -> 13024.86s]  something I'm just gonna let Prover get hit in the head in this next encounter
[13024.86s -> 13047.79s]  mushroom where's a mushroom Prover can't help you with that I don't think anybody
[13047.79s -> 13069.40s]  can what about Roberto Roberto can't help you with that Prover is the
[13069.40s -> 13088.45s]  healings room what oh look how good you are actually kind of good he's got very
[13088.45s -> 13115.62s]  high intelligence and it's poison got a teddy bear the bunny can't fit in there
[13115.62s -> 13126.21s]  I don't think mushroom obtained silver coin yeah we tried to put put the bunny
[13126.21s -> 13138.37s]  in there last time nobody can do anything with that can you give the
[13138.37s -> 13153.23s]  teddy bear to my little brother no it's mine you see those video clips of the
[13153.23s -> 13158.29s]  baseball home runs where this is some buddy sitting next to a little kid and
[13158.29s -> 13164.41s]  the big home run Wow and the guy or girl whatever reaches over like the kid
[13164.41s -> 13173.57s]  and grabs the home run and cheers and doesn't give it to the kid that's what I
[13173.57s -> 13194.16s]  do isn't that part of a Will Ferrell movie probably yeah soon I caught it I
[13194.16s -> 13201.86s]  caught the ball I caught the ball I did I did it no no you cannot have the
[13201.90s -> 13227.00s]  ball no it's my ball no probably something like that yeah you probably
[13227.00s -> 13240.43s]  root for the Red Sox so it makes sense all sports fans of the same sports fans
[13240.43s -> 13269.24s]  as Jerry Seinfeld once said you're rooting for laundry god damn it I should
[13269.24s -> 13286.15s]  be trying to level them up anyways no of course you want to support your team
[13286.15s -> 13292.36s]  right I like the Red Sox because they grew up in the area and they had a
[13292.36s -> 13307.52s]  stadium it's fun to go to games and hey this is the team where I live I think
[13307.52s -> 13313.04s]  wrestling is wrestling now I don't think is cooler but the idea of wrestling is
[13313.04s -> 13317.12s]  cooler I think because it's a theater show where they actually like to hurt
[13317.12s -> 13324.59s]  each other kind of and there's like like a big in baseball if they were like
[13324.59s -> 13330.80s]  dramatic story arcs where you know at one point the center fielder got like
[13330.80s -> 13336.12s]  kidnapped or something and an old guy with like a vase came out and halfway
[13336.12s -> 13339.92s]  through the fourth inning like resurrected the center fielder or
[13339.92s -> 13346.88s]  something I imagine there was like the wacky bullshit from wrestling in
[13346.88s -> 13355.82s]  baseball and football yeah turns out I don't know what happened the entire
[13355.82s -> 13363.04s]  outfield is not here we haven't seen the entire outfield in two straight days but
[13363.04s -> 13365.96s]  they're gonna play the game anyways and it's just the infield and they there's
[13365.96s -> 13369.64s]  like fly balls going over their heads and shit and then finally after like four
[13369.64s -> 13375.76s]  of like a five maybe six innings it cuts to backstage of the outfielders coming
[13375.76s -> 13381.05s]  into the stadium they're getting into the outfielders here they are they made
[13381.05s -> 13390.78s]  into the stadium and then a car drives and runs two of them over the car who
[13390.78s -> 13398.01s]  is that it's like the manager of the other team oh my god oh that's Bill
[13398.05s -> 13409.01s]  Broski the third base coach for the Orioles and then the one outfielder has
[13409.01s -> 13418.24s]  to play every position imagine if the wrestling weird shit was in other sports
[13418.24s -> 13427.49s]  instead of the pitcher walking from the bullpen they like how do you like an
[13427.49s -> 13432.84s]  elaborate entrance he like comes up from the ground and this like fire around the
[13432.84s -> 13446.97s]  mound like gangrel used to do back in the attitude error he drinks from a
[13446.97s -> 13463.18s]  goblet of blood that's a gangrel used to do that where the hell is this
[13463.18s -> 13471.35s]  mushroom and all of them instead of special moves they had special they'd
[13471.35s -> 13477.42s]  know they still had their finishing moves but it was weird pitches and wacky
[13477.42s -> 13482.50s]  baseball like batting stances and you knew when he did the weird fucked up
[13482.50s -> 13489.74s]  stance it was his finishing move and you might hit a home run here the pitcher
[13489.74s -> 13492.54s]  changes their windup to be their finishing move wind up and it's like
[13492.54s -> 13511.49s]  here it is the quirky ball this is just making the Mario games real life as of
[13511.49s -> 13525.91s]  what it is Mario Baseball is just what I'm describing Mario Super Slugger but
[13525.91s -> 13554.48s]  wouldn't that be fun scream it scream what baseball somebody asked earlier
[13554.52s -> 13561.97s]  what's with all the violent sports references what what are you talking
[13561.97s -> 13569.98s]  about yeah they'd have like weird special
[13569.98s -> 13572.66s]  abilities like I know like we're talking about Mario sluggers but imagine if
[13572.66s -> 13580.86s]  somebody was like this really like decrepit small old man came up to the
[13580.86s -> 13589.45s]  mound it's like oh here it is this is old man yeah people I don't know what
[13589.45s -> 13594.61s]  I couldn't I couldn't think of a name he comes up and he gets to the mound and
[13594.61s -> 13597.41s]  everyone's like oh wait that's who this guy sucks like who's this guy's terrible
[13597.41s -> 13602.53s]  and he pulls up well you know everyone knows of course old man people's got the
[13602.53s -> 13607.25s]  cannon he sucks himself but he's got a great item he gets on the mound and he
[13607.25s -> 13611.17s]  loads the baseball into the cannon and it's like shoots into the catcher's
[13611.17s -> 13625.04s]  minute like 7,000 miles per hour the catcher would have to just get out of
[13625.04s -> 13633.76s]  the way no the catcher gets a special item too that's why you have these two
[13633.76s -> 13637.76s]  guys work together one of your catchers has like a metal plate for a catcher's
[13637.76s -> 13647.66s]  minute and he does like a wicked comedy stance when he loads the thing and does
[13647.66s -> 13653.90s]  the lights the fuse he likes if using that jumps back and goes puts his
[13653.90s -> 13674.36s]  fingers both fingers in his ears and crouches down everyone screams old man
[13674.36s -> 13682.29s]  no no no he's just he just screams crouches down it's gotta be a loud one
[13682.29s -> 13698.73s]  Mario Kart double-dash but with WWE wrestlers didn't they do that already
[13699.96s -> 13708.27s]  energize obtains cave search really doesn't move to have to learn yeah they
[13708.27s -> 13718.56s]  already did that yeah i streamed that game i forgot that's true i that was as
[13718.56s -> 13732.16s]  well that was a stream on this channel i genuinely thought that you made the
[13732.16s -> 13757.64s]  gnome video for a while what i did too i no i didn't uh 10 community subs just
[13757.64s -> 13768.97s]  came in from pin man thank you for the 10 community stuff big sub drop thank
[13768.97s -> 13782.60s]  you that was quick i think i'll probably get to level 8 after this one maybe i'll
[13782.60s -> 13795.77s]  learn something new something at level 8 a new trait new passive there it is
[13795.77s -> 13808.03s]  Roberto mastered midair midair midair is that his finisher
[13808.03s -> 13827.76s]  mid holy shit life damage s accuracy a this is what i'm using now what is this
[13827.76s -> 13837.60s]  is short range takes almost my entire guts meter takes 50 guts so it has to go
[13837.60s -> 13844.54s]  in this short range slot but holy crap that's i have to put it i'm gonna
[13844.54s -> 13851.52s]  replace kick we're gonna try this out i'm actually i'm gonna do this too i'm
[13851.52s -> 13858.24s]  gonna put charge down here i'm gonna put turn slash here i'm gonna put regular
[13858.24s -> 13865.12s]  slash here and then midair here
[13872.28s -> 13884.44s]  let's see what this does it says the highest damage you can possibly have for
[13884.44s -> 13892.19s]  a move in the game and one of the highest accuracy ratings let's see how it
[13894.03s -> 13910.00s]  is midair wow uh oh i don't know if uh i don't know if it's possible for me to
[13910.00s -> 13918.60s]  lose i think i will take this character to s or at least a ranking and wipe the
[13918.60s -> 13924.92s]  floor with everyone because that move potentially will doesn't matter even a
[13924.92s -> 13931.87s]  high health pool it's over 200 220 250 health is a lot of health that's an
[13931.87s -> 13940.11s]  instant kill move and it's one of the most accurate in the game rose perfume
[13940.11s -> 13945.77s]  it's pronounced midair not midair but don't tell me but don't let me tell you
[13945.77s -> 13967.90s]  how to live your life midare midare midair midair midoria
[13985.66s -> 13999.85s]  prover flower dance is this it oh sick yeah sick yeah sick dude dude sick yeah
[13999.85s -> 14007.00s]  yeah sick yeah put in a little too much the mushrooms were somewhere around here
[14010.16s -> 14016.00s]  what is it i hear the voice of a monster it's saying be gone from my territory
[14018.14s -> 14020.70s]  something's headed this way watch out
[14032.27s -> 14047.74s]  blobster oh something's coming it's the blobster let's kill him in one hit he dodged it he dodged
[14047.74s -> 14062.80s]  the midair not this one all right let's clean it up with a swing all right you two guts relax
[14063.68s -> 14080.36s]  see you later blobster oh i get it he's a lobster wow good thing i did that with
[14080.36s -> 14089.98s]  roberto i was level nine well that was a real tough one not really oh look fain over there the
[14089.98s -> 14101.18s]  mushroom i feel like i just did that on stream i feel like i just like activated one of my scenes
[14101.82s -> 14111.07s]  can't believe you remembered this yeah if i see something once i rarely forget it
[14112.38s -> 14117.10s]  that's why when i picked up the gaia stone and saw the vision i felt like i'd seen it before
[14118.14s -> 14130.30s]  let's go home we've got to give this to maro yes that's right joke incoming no not really
[14136.14s -> 14139.98s]  february week four week four
[14146.28s -> 14155.44s]  let's go give it tomorrow save the game what's versus data i think that means you can bring
[14155.44s -> 14169.32s]  monsters to your friend's house approver on ice not until i get to rank b with roberto
[14169.96s -> 14177.02s]  well you know what fuck it let's do it now actually i want to do the let's see what we
[14177.02s -> 14185.90s]  got for training here we wanted power and accuracy with roberto it's plenty of power
[14186.54s -> 14192.86s]  that move is going to be incredible and then under incredible undodgeable
[14194.22s -> 14197.10s]  and i will win the entire video game with roberto
[14197.58s -> 14223.18s]  but undoing couple undodgeable hey these guys are gonna be dna food oh hungry right
[14225.93s -> 14234.70s]  um oh you don't like any food i have to go to the town you can eat in a minute you're fine

[14308.94s -> 14314.70s]  kalaragi jungle well it's a very odd place the jungle is littered with these gadget thingies

[14342.64s -> 14357.60s]  oh uh guys i was never soft-locked i had to press x
[14365.63s -> 14368.56s]  so apparently there's that
[14371.32s -> 14382.62s]  need food all right we want i need more carrots

[14427.52s -> 14434.60s]  hello there what are you doing here oh uh well i wanted to thank you for the other day so
[14436.38s -> 14442.96s]  shoot you don't have to thank us no i do and about the battles in ruin you better learn new
[14442.96s -> 14449.92s]  battle techniques if you don't learn counters you'll have a hard time i wanted to warn you
[14451.74s -> 14474.59s]  counters what kind of ability is that time to learn a counter the counter when an opponent
[14474.59s -> 14482.52s]  attacks hold the l2 button then push the button you think they used i'll use an x button move
[14482.92s -> 14503.40s]  uh so i have to guess what button they're pressing but what do you mean x yeah but you can also change
[14503.40s -> 14514.54s]  skills by pushing different buttons try performing a skill with the o button yes with the o button
[14514.54s -> 14521.34s]  you perform a skill precisely damage is lowered but you may contact more often next try performing
[14521.34s -> 14537.36s]  a skill with the square button to perform a skill with force what how did we not hear know this
[14537.36s -> 14546.27s]  before why is the tutorial for this yeah why is it halfway through the game it's not halfway
[14546.27s -> 14555.85s]  through the game so circle is force does a lot of damage x button yeah that's what i've been doing
[14555.85s -> 14569.10s]  this whole time what does that do i've been doing every single move with x that's a no okay normally
[14570.40s -> 14572.24s]  try using the x again to perform a skill
[14573.04s -> 14603.88s]  so i have to guess at what button they press and okay thanks well fooey you get away from him girl
[14605.52s -> 14608.88s]  huh tt you came all this way geez lay off and go home
[14611.21s -> 14618.16s]  you sure are charming you must think you're king of the world today i'll show you who's a real boss
[14618.16s -> 14625.20s]  around here get your pesky assistant and prepare yourselves oh boy well okay let's make it a tag
[14625.20s -> 14642.54s]  battle let's see what you got tag battle that mechanic is the whole reason i dislike this game
[14644.56s -> 14651.42s]  i've had so many victories snatched away in s rank because of that oh all right we're going
[14651.42s -> 14664.70s]  up against your garbage and calorino okay time to learn about tag battles first the tag how to
[14664.70s -> 14672.35s]  switch monsters i've done before try this l1 l1 tag out now you've switched in tag battles you
[14672.35s -> 14683.53s]  were able to use partnership powers take a deep breath stay still and wait team up there now your
[14683.53s -> 14690.84s]  partnership power is charged now you can carry out a chase attack while your partnership power
[14690.84s -> 14697.53s]  is rising the skill panel turns red select the panel and use a skill after you perform a skill
[14697.53s -> 14709.18s]  the standby partner will do a chase attack so that all right so you have to have the team up
[14709.82s -> 14729.02s]  did we even we didn't even play why you you have the nerve to use combinations on me
[14731.64s -> 14737.26s]  this is just the pits i'm going home counters and tag moves this is so cool thanks philia
[14738.38s -> 14743.76s]  not at all i'm glad you like them well see you around fain best of luck i can't wait to use
[14743.76s -> 14751.07s]  those on you because you're going to be the champion of the next area and i'm going to use
[14752.19s -> 14756.83s]  tag maneuvers on you and you're going to be like i can't believe i told you that i told you those
[14756.83s -> 14782.36s]  things all right so we can do let me see no official tournaments so i i'm gonna i'm gonna
[14782.36s -> 14787.77s]  just go to the jungle everybody let's feed and what do we got for schedules who's tired
[14788.73s -> 14789.45s]  everyone's all right
[14794.60s -> 14799.24s]  book high jump and sandbag and then we can feed everybody and then do the jungle
[14806.56s -> 14813.23s]  or we go i don't think both of these guys just suck should we should just make them
[14813.23s -> 14825.98s]  dna if we can try to get some new monsters yeah sorry roger oh i don't think he knew that i was
[14825.98s -> 14833.88s]  just a mushroom this whole time stan stan i can't believe you didn't see through my disguise
[14839.98s -> 14850.33s]  and you maybe both people suck uh i want to go to town
[14855.45s -> 14868.60s]  have some fish we could do some combinations but where i could put some discs in look at how
[14868.60s -> 14878.35s]  hungry you are well it's you just are they friends they might not be friends to combine
[14883.48s -> 14908.24s]  what is it what's this link that is a long messy link not a virus it's not that messy
[14922.11s -> 14944.17s]  that crying face is gonna follow me forever let's see lawful good neutral good chaotic good
[14945.13s -> 14958.46s]  lawful neutral true neutral chaotic neutral neutral evil lawful evil uh chaotic neutral and
[14958.46s -> 14967.80s]  chaotic evil are the same image except in chaotic evil there's a little bit of gray hair dusting
[14967.80s -> 14986.51s]  just having more gray hair makes me eviler yes apparently there's gray hair in all of them
[14987.23s -> 15018.32s]  the fuck there is no there's not i don't have gray hair all right should we go to the haba
[15019.52s -> 15029.32s]  select the monster to be retired
[15032.35s -> 15046.73s]  look at that 303 power energize sucks 160 160 not good enough 241 and 212 really isn't bad
[15046.73s -> 15074.68s]  but you just you just aren't very good freeze roberto or no balls why would i ever do that
[15076.52s -> 15086.44s]  i've ranked up to another rank let's see if we can get some new monsters i got a bunch of
[15086.44s -> 15091.60s]  playstation 1 games over there and some playstation 2 we'll try some of those
[15093.28s -> 15108.00s]  create i would like to use a saucer stone all right let me grab hold on let me grab
[15108.80s -> 15135.24s]  some of those other discs over here stuntman alias the ring stuntman again the jackass game
[15135.24s -> 15152.27s]  let's put in let's put in the ring put in the fallout boy cd i don't own i don't own a fallout
[15152.27s -> 15162.24s]  boy cd there you go for proof he could be putting anything in there he could be putting the same
[15162.24s -> 15166.56s]  thing in there he's just like he's just acting on stream i mean i'm a fucking damn good actor
[15167.36s -> 15185.68s]  this is the ring burn the brown note onto a cd and then play that and do that i don't even have
[15187.36s -> 15196.54s]  i don't even have a burnable cd i don't have to burn okay i have a question those of you that
[15196.54s -> 15205.23s]  i don't have a cdr or anything but i have a question is it possible for me to burn over this
[15206.28s -> 15224.78s]  this is just a disc right can i just delete this and burn over it there's no way oh well
[15224.78s -> 15254.56s]  it's read only read only memory so this is from the ring thank you for waiting
[15265.61s -> 15268.57s]  no shroom no shroom no shroom and no rumor either
[15288.32s -> 15315.00s]  well let's put alias in here this is playstation 2 i think it actually might be the dreamcast
[15315.00s -> 15343.40s]  curse yeah it's just dreamcast i don't i didn't want to believe it but now i do alias something
[15343.40s -> 15364.99s]  give me a new seed let's see something awesome something that i'll be proud to level up after
[15364.99s -> 15382.25s]  this we'll do jackass the game um all right what the hell is this it's a skull flower
[15385.20s -> 15395.50s]  not a mushroom let's i'll take a look at it it's the mushroom but it's dead
[15403.58s -> 15415.39s]  the unprover unprover doomer i like the unprover i don't think it'll fit though
[15419.79s -> 15423.63s]  so
[15424.75s -> 15429.15s]  now it doesn't fit
[15438.32s -> 15439.36s]  unprover
[15446.35s -> 15457.40s]  i can do the actual word but i can't do two o's the way that you want unprover i can do unprover
[15462.40s -> 15483.00s]  the unprover unprover isn't a word yeah i know unprover try another stone this is jackass what
[15483.00s -> 15490.59s]  does that word mean that means that you are um if you're a prover that means you're proving
[15490.59s -> 15499.87s]  something no fuck it whatever so an unprover uh this is that's weird to understand explain i
[15499.87s -> 15506.83s]  know what it means but i can't explain what it means does that make sense it means that you are
[15506.83s -> 15512.33s]  supposed to be somebody that can prove things but you're not being able to prove anything
[15512.33s -> 15516.73s]  you're a disprover but you're unproving things it's i i can't explain it you guys know what i mean
[15516.73s -> 15540.14s]  so debunk no no but he's the prover that's his name his name is the prover the unprover
[15541.48s -> 15545.08s]  at that i mean we're not using that's not the terminology like proving something
[15545.08s -> 15558.73s]  it's his actual name he's the prover guys it's a proverb thank you

[15777.24s -> 15794.92s]  god wow you're fucking huge all right let's see come on uh 163 intelligence base why is everybody
[15794.92s -> 15803.84s]  laughing that base intellect level nine 163 base intellect don't he's bad okay yes it's all right
[15803.84s -> 15831.04s]  though is the unprover better 153 what about the moves fire fire and bite and then power moves
[15831.04s -> 15841.48s]  with the tail d bite what is d bite all right what about you unprover what do you got i kind
[15841.48s -> 15855.44s]  of like unprover let me see again what do you have the moves uh this is pecking and pollen
[15856.16s -> 15863.26s]  kind of like the other one but much better base stats yeah they're not going to hand us a god
[15863.26s -> 15870.46s]  character that's true he's good 163 base stats at just being born is really actually pretty good
[15871.34s -> 15883.45s]  147 power 163 and just mash intellect and um accuracy and can be used for a fusion later as
[15883.45s -> 15892.80s]  well this is true all right um let's get them in let's get them into the uh let's go intellect
[15892.80s -> 15909.00s]  and uh accuracy oh maybe i'll just hammer accuracy for a little while let's hammer accuracy
[15911.40s -> 15922.80s]  and then uh rest we'll bring up uh intelligence book gonna be a smart dragon
[15922.80s -> 15928.97s]  again rest and we'll go to
[15931.77s -> 15935.29s]  more accuracy and we'll take a look at it after that all right you on the other hand
[15936.41s -> 15949.36s]  what do you need uh defense and intelligence maybe you kind of need a lot of things intelligence
[15949.36s -> 15956.52s]  and accuracy defense and speed maybe defense in life i'm gonna say defense in life for now
[15963.88s -> 15985.69s]  okay and then we'll take a look at it afterwards there will be the book it's an int now you on the
[15985.69s -> 15993.77s]  other hand you're doing just fine but you also need to rest here and then we'll do power let's
[15993.77s -> 16008.97s]  take a look here we go that's a lot for being zero years old unprover didn't do very well what
[16008.97s -> 16023.66s]  does this dragon like to eat good job save i'll save i'll save i'll save i'll save i'll save
[16024.30s -> 16038.43s]  it's the skull and you're doing fine too all right proceed the weekend activities let's
[16038.43s -> 16045.34s]  should i just take them yeah let's just take them out to the jungle i have Roberto Roberto
[16045.34s -> 16052.91s]  can just carry everybody free experience free exp i mean maybe Roberto should just go
[16055.23s -> 16084.04s]  i'll save yeah save first okay Roberto's so much better than everyone else yeah but he's also a
[16084.04s -> 16091.76s]  lot older think of it this way if i do three or four weeks of intelligence with the dragon
[16094.91s -> 16102.94s]  there'll be over 200 intelligence that's pretty great actually all right target sandbag and
[16102.94s -> 16117.87s]  lifeblade game is saved and we'll take everybody into the jungle after this i'll tell you though
[16117.87s -> 16128.22s]  he's got really really good stat uh stat adding usually it takes him to like at least six months
[16128.22s -> 16140.88s]  before they start getting that much so he'll be really good stat adding okay what does he eat
[16140.88s -> 16155.63s]  though are you gonna be mad if i give you like a carrot is that thank you or is that no thank you
[16156.27s -> 16174.48s]  okay you're doing just fine i think you eat uh you eat mangoes and shit i can't believe we
[16174.48s -> 16186.12s]  got a dragon out of jackass okay uh i think it's time let's say good job to you too
[16187.08s -> 16199.82s]  so proceed to the weekend head to the jungle and let's continue because i want to be able to do
[16200.70s -> 16208.73s]  higher ranks bring everybody it's just free experience for the other two because they're
[16208.73s -> 16230.78s]  not going to take any damage well at least i hope not jungle so we're just supposed to explore this
[16230.78s -> 16238.83s]  and find the junk right uh you currently have unlocked dragon and robot you can get a cool
[16238.83s -> 16248.84s]  robot dragon or bone dragon or shroom dragon and the the i want to have right now is part naga so
[16248.84s -> 16277.55s]  it likes fish okay good to know let's see what happens uh well that's it even in the next area
[16277.55s -> 16291.87s]  he's too good he might be too good level nine obtained wind lure i don't know what that means
[16292.51s -> 16299.85s]  let's find out so there's a fish type that's funny what is wind war
[16304.49s -> 16310.97s]  ups wind and fire power and lets you add a wind power to skill you still don't get how that works
[16317.32s -> 16327.26s]  you combine Roberto and the dragon and get a metal dragon that would be crazy well i got an
[16327.26s -> 16353.02s]  intelligence stone whatever that means help for your information yeah i know i know i've read it
[16353.02s -> 16377.10s]  the first time that's so good i'm gonna play with a spiroid for a little bit try to get him some
[16377.10s -> 16410.81s]  levels am i using square i'm just using x at the moment that system's kind of weird forward i bring
[16410.81s -> 16428.73s]  up the dragon what the hell are you guys doing over here now you know but you know the car when
[16428.73s -> 16433.72s]  you're driving the car you know there's a i know the gas pedal but there's also a brake
[16437.90s -> 16441.98s]  you've not maybe you might well put your foot on the brake and just gently put your foot on it and
[16441.98s -> 16459.32s]  press it a little uh-huh and do a drift hey as long as you start to slow down a little
[16459.32s -> 16476.60s]  come on where's the stuff this stuff here can i touch anything with the bushes or anything no
[16477.64s -> 16505.84s]  i want to see what the fire looks like what is that thing spiroids let's see fire that is such
[16505.84s -> 16526.36s]  a weird monster seriously holy shit this thing's amazing real shit just got real probably should
[16526.36s -> 16538.75s]  try to counter that that was awesome so you gotta do those quick and guess it correctly so you have
[16538.75s -> 16546.27s]  a one in three chance to get that right and you have to do it fast got him the anime move
[16548.41s -> 16560.92s]  hard skin and detail level up a couple more times see if i can get another move or two there
[16561.88s -> 16572.11s]  it doesn't very much help but Roberto carry um can somebody dig
[16574.27s -> 16583.16s]  can spyroid dig actually no you have to learn it don't you yeah something you learn by leveling up
[16593.28s -> 16603.12s]  burn that's big let's go big on it power move real i don't know what that even means
[16604.00s -> 16618.60s]  he blocked it blocked it again he's bullish uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh he's gotta hit it here
[16619.48s -> 16662.83s]  uh-oh i missed well jackass dragon oh well how are you still here well he was just bullish half
[16662.83s -> 16679.98s]  the time nice dodge he's that counter now you're dead lower lifespan well he shouldn't have missed
[16679.98s -> 16700.49s]  four of the moves i tried well what does bullish even mean like stupid it means stubborn
[16701.05s -> 16721.66s]  well don't be so stubborn otherwise it's gonna get you killed he learned he'll figure it out
[16722.22s -> 16743.47s]  he's just a baby i know what bullish means bullish in like a stock market term is not
[16743.47s -> 16750.49s]  what they mean in this game it's like a financial term that they're not like oh things are looking
[16750.49s -> 16765.71s]  bullish not this again i didn't say it i didn't bring it up i tried to fight to stop it from
[16765.71s -> 16800.40s]  happening nothing how can i cross this oh almost got the teenage mutant ninja turtles
[16801.88s -> 16831.66s]  boss character ah this thing almost level 10 so it's not this way wherever this random junk
[16831.66s -> 16855.40s]  that this guy wants is not here this would be level 10 hopefully we get something good at level
[16855.40s -> 16875.90s]  10 actually countered it unbelievable dude all right so it's just turned this is this just turned
[16875.90s -> 16900.51s]  into a guessing game yes really oh come on if you don't try to counter you can still block it
[16901.31s -> 16911.60s]  welcome to the reason why i said go back to two well we're already this invested
[16911.60s -> 16920.78s]  magic lore for Roberto unprover obtained sniper Roberto mastered air shot and unprover has slap
[16920.78s -> 16941.39s]  now air shot what is air shot air shot accuracy a so it's an intelligence move was it like a
[16941.95s -> 16948.96s]  moonlit sword move that's a lot of guts damage i think that's the highest guts damage thing i have
[16949.60s -> 16954.36s]  yep so this is a far range i can put it pretty much anywhere
[16957.82s -> 16965.80s]  so my intelligence is terrible though and i also got the magic lore helps magic power
[16968.49s -> 16975.60s]  uh what about the other unprover got pecking slap
[16977.74s -> 16985.82s]  slap is a accuracy much better accuracy but does barely any damage uh this is kind of just uh
[16986.78s -> 16991.63s]  light move to maybe get one last tap in for them to guess and uh block it
[16995.76s -> 17019.40s]  all right let me find this thing great now the other baby is gonna die no he's not check it
[17019.40s -> 17031.05s]  no if he gets hit once Roberto's coming well Roberto's coming Roberto we'll get it
[17033.31s -> 17044.43s]  let's try it air shot that's pretty cool if you know if you have to zone somebody up oh fuck
[17047.00s -> 17059.50s]  don't let that happen i could get out of here they're almost dead this is bad i don't want to
[17059.50s -> 17069.69s]  lose any more health i hope it's in this box they're not prepared for this yet oh shit oh no
[17092.59s -> 17101.23s]  all right i need to get to the menu i need to sort first before this happens
[17102.03s -> 17108.43s]  put Roberto up front because otherwise he's gonna get hit and die item do i have anything
[17108.43s -> 17116.17s]  thing no oh use when combining to regenerate a monster with higher intelligence that's pretty
[17116.17s -> 17128.12s]  cool all right please be in here toy junk get me out of here before somebody dies
[17130.44s -> 17146.88s]  fuck this is bad let's just hope for no random battle this is it right look at this huge area
[17150.08s -> 17173.04s]  that's good obtain a speed stone oh my god this is so huge no don't do this got it come on

[17808.80s -> 17816.70s]  told you twitch has approved of my scratch off stream so that's gonna happen risk of rain with
[17816.70s -> 17825.82s]  italics maybe more monster rancher 4 some more vr maybe and something else very special something
[17825.82s -> 17837.39s]  very very special will also be happening uh during that period of three streams in a row late april
[17837.39s -> 17846.75s]  fools no no no no a lot of you already know what it is but it looks really really fucking cool so

[17881.87s -> 17888.59s]  i have to take care of they fall at the time periods where it just makes it so i can't stream
[17889.23s -> 17896.12s]  but let's go let's continue for like another couple hours we've got
[17899.00s -> 17906.88s]  all right i need to go find the junk he's already signed up for this one what have we got how old
[17906.88s -> 17927.24s]  is roberto because this is roberto is a year and a half almost roberto is a year and a half
[17928.04s -> 17938.56s]  he's only we gotta get him up there now so much power some let's get over 200 accuracy
[17939.58s -> 17947.74s]  and then i'm gonna move into once he gets over like 220 accuracy i think we'll split it between
[17948.70s -> 17954.60s]  power and speed or power in life power indeed probably power in life maybe a little bit of
[17954.60s -> 17967.48s]  defense so he's resting today he's gonna do get that yeah we'll do two let's get the rest of the
[17968.84s -> 17971.16s]  accuracy out of the way try to get like 220 240
[17973.76s -> 17979.76s]  and then power power and we'll take a look after that you on the other hand you're doing book book
[17979.76s -> 17990.43s]  rest yeah intelligence tub tub rest all right okay sounds good hydrate i'm drinking right now

[18037.80s -> 18053.08s]  not a lie that's for real everybody's working today there we go two more accuracy and we should
[18053.08s -> 18059.95s]  be good to go with accuracy until probably rank like a i would assume to give you some food good
[18059.95s -> 18092.97s]  job first of all and carry please die already Roberto why are you saying that really ban that
[18092.97s -> 18122.68s]  guy a dragon that eats carrots i need to get meat almost there to do potentially the official cup
[18122.68s -> 18129.28s]  is to go get the junk i'm sure everybody has something to do today yeah no you don't need to
[18129.28s -> 18148.91s]  rest back to the book then rest you no don't rest you're fine target target target you
[18150.43s -> 18167.04s]  uh just do sandbag sandbag sandbag rest pretty good hey that's not bad it's pretty good
[18167.84s -> 18178.19s]  it's pretty good pretty good pretty good all right you now need to press
[18180.99s -> 18183.79s]  i swear these little flower guys eat more than anybody else
[18188.41s -> 18193.74s]  the mushrooms and the flowers eat way more you you you eat more food than the dragon does
[18194.38s -> 18209.08s]  how makes no sense all right now everybody seems to be this is a day of rest
[18209.08s -> 18232.75s]  rest rest rest anybody feeling down everybody good lively let's give you something to eat too
[18235.23s -> 18249.77s]  a mango this time this is like a little snack okay you're good lively lively and you're all good
[18249.77s -> 18256.30s]  a little bit more training
[18264.91s -> 18271.53s]  so let's get you into the accuracy right but i want to do one more
[18273.37s -> 18277.77s]  let's get you into the book again and then you into the light blade
[18281.92s -> 18293.61s]  pretty great gains Roberto should be fine now for accuracy for a while he's probably over to 22 30
[18303.98s -> 18310.92s]  and let's also good work
[18320.00s -> 18328.03s]  okay everybody's all right what we got for competitions something's coming up right
[18329.82s -> 18338.33s]  yeah cup of more weeks Roberto has this that'll give him enough to actually compete
[18338.33s -> 18355.95s]  and bring him up to here to be so let's see let's block out the week here so we got let's do
[18358.35s -> 18364.89s]  a sandbag and then maybe a rest here yeah let's say sandbag and then rest he should be good to go
[18364.89s -> 18370.65s]  and then we'll from there going forward we're going to do power and life or power and defense
[18371.61s -> 18377.31s]  you need some more accuracy yes you do and health is fine for both of you good for
[18389.20s -> 18396.12s]  all right you can relax now what's with the gross plant get rumor back
[18397.08s -> 18413.24s]  um i really hate to tell you this but rumor is rumor is dead i'm sorry
[18421.28s -> 18431.47s]  here have a potato you liked it no he didn't like it he was he was pissed off at that
[18432.19s -> 18449.32s]  all right you got a tournament tomorrow so it should have been you it should have been you
[18449.40s -> 18462.64s]  instead yeah who's gonna raise them who's gonna play i will me maybe i will so this is today
[18464.32s -> 18484.01s]  rest today target and you can rest today too and then do life bad plus four only what's up with
[18484.01s -> 18502.91s]  that oh you're tired all right you're yeah uh i'm sorry but roberto is the last one i have to win
[18503.87s -> 18515.28s]  don't feed your monster potatoes it's the worst food in the whole game even if the monster likes
[18515.28s -> 18527.68s]  it well i actually haven't been i truly have not been i've been given to mangoes and carrots and
[18527.68s -> 18538.92s]  bananas all right shouldn't be too much of a problem everybody in c rank seems to be just
[18538.92s -> 18549.20s]  across the board 180 190 on every step we saw that weird monster with 482 intelligence that time
[18550.24s -> 18551.04s]  made no sense
[18562.99s -> 18574.54s]  i'll just bully you forever i want to spray that flower with roundup oh my god easy
[18579.08s -> 18585.28s]  he already is dark dead how do you kill which that is already dead
[18587.44s -> 18608.96s]  my power with fire that's not a good start
[18608.96s -> 18623.82s]  all right look at that damage look at that damage he's unstoppable unbeatable immutable
[18624.62s -> 18638.73s]  unbelievable irreplaceable irredeemable undeniable this is versus push
[18640.54s -> 18675.82s]  oh 232 with insane accuracy just kill it fast kill it fast aesthetic that's not good
[18682.65s -> 18712.00s]  again quick thank god that yeah nice game mechanic that actually sucks i can't fucking
[18712.00s -> 18716.96s]  wait for Roberto to win again jesus christ that arrogant fuck thinks he's so fucking tough
[18717.52s -> 18722.56s]  of picking on unprepared ai's what a load of shit what's the point of having attorney
[18722.56s -> 18736.62s]  if we know what the results will be all right out of any coffee pasta just coffee paste
[18736.62s -> 18742.62s]  bullshit my favorite it really is the one about my mom bought me a laptop for my birthday and it's
[18742.62s -> 18750.19s]  heating up my laptop and just burning my legs that's i that's actually a funny thing
[18751.29s -> 18766.27s]  coffee pasta's like all right here it comes but that's actually kind of funny i don't want i don't
[18766.27s -> 18770.67s]  have to get no isn't it like it it's burning my legs it hurts and shit i thought that was that's

[18876.62s -> 18898.86s]  how you doing you doing good proceed i think it's time now to try to find that junk because
[18898.86s -> 18899.82s]  Roberto's ready
[18905.50s -> 18911.39s]  how tired is everybody uh maybe i'll wait i'll wait till like the next day
[18918.78s -> 18921.50s]  hello how are things need anything today go ahead take a look around
[18923.90s -> 18927.74s]  not really unless you have something new do you have anything new
[18929.50s -> 18934.81s]  get the same shit what about i have those stones right no
[18934.81s -> 18953.76s]  no well see you later everyone's all right yeah it's probably it's time maybe you should rest

[18960.84s -> 18965.55s]  open the book up with the tub and they'll be okay they don't doesn't matter anyways
[18965.55s -> 18975.69s]  then i can feed everybody and go on the adventure good increase i played a lot of monster rancher
[18975.69s -> 18979.29s]  too when i was 10 but then one of my monsters died of old age and i cried and i quit playing
[18979.29s -> 19008.38s]  forever that's sad but you know life life is a circle you know you have some mango
[19019.82s -> 19027.12s]  everyone's good let's find the junk in the jungle let's bring everybody let's just farm experience
[19027.12s -> 19044.22s]  for these two start exploring so i didn't do this last time somehow i found the end
[19044.30s -> 19045.66s]  but i need to find the junk
[19048.51s -> 19082.04s]  i guess time is cubic no time is a circle the earth is a circle the snake eating itself
[19085.76s -> 19101.04s]  the oreboreus is a circle pizza is a circle your brain is a circle your head is a circle
[19101.04s -> 19119.77s]  the pills i just took that make me think this strangely shaped like a circle everything just
[19119.77s -> 19138.83s]  circle man the casino chips they're a circle the earth is a circle the moon is a circle the sun is
[19138.83s -> 19166.00s]  a circle 87 chance to hit now i think that's fine final guts it up now don't do drugs it's
[19166.00s -> 19183.47s]  fucking bad for you don't be crazy don't be an idiot tylenol okay i'm gonna list you the drugs
[19183.47s -> 19207.45s]  that are okay tylenol that's all
[19221.37s -> 19231.71s]  level 11 what do i get genius he's now a genius this one you thought Roberto couldn't get any
[19231.71s -> 19244.60s]  better genius increases intelligence attacks but strength attacks damage easily what can i turn
[19244.60s -> 19259.37s]  this off i don't know what does this mean but strength attacks damage easily i get hurt more
[19259.37s -> 19273.76s]  by strength that's terrible oh somebody can dig right who can dig straight down
[19274.56s -> 19296.43s]  uh unprover right i think so investigate it unprover couldn't find anything what good
[19297.15s -> 19298.75s]  are you gonna give me here man come on
[19322.38s -> 19338.99s]  this game looks like a fake game that an extra would be playing in a movie uh spyroid obtained
[19339.07s -> 19342.11s]  big lung i got toy glasses
[19353.69s -> 19354.73s]  it's very funny
[19357.77s -> 19365.74s]  is it a trait big lung increases power of moves that expel breath so fire
[19371.16s -> 19375.96s]  a fake game that the extra is playing in the movie somewhere in the background
[19376.68s -> 19421.20s]  you don't even get a chance sit down germa subs you are a germa sub all right junk
[19428.14s -> 19438.20s]  junk yes obtained junk toy that's it right that's what he wanted is germa sub to germa yes but
[19438.20s -> 19445.96s]  germa is sub to germa because germa is germa is germa so therefore it just gets a badge next to
[19445.96s -> 19459.45s]  their name i thought that was a monster i just get a sub to my own channel but it's not i don't
[19459.45s -> 19469.08s]  have to pay for it it's just there i didn't do anything i just have it wait was there something
[19469.08s -> 19483.00s]  over here that i just walked by no imagine subbing to germa see to that the person just said that
[19483.00s -> 19491.37s]  and they're not subscribed so they can say that i mean it's rude exceptionally rude but we're not
[19491.37s -> 19525.04s]  going to talk about that we're just talking about facts i don't know the toy is not the junk that i
[19525.04s -> 19532.76s]  need did you wave your hands and fingers across while you said that in a kind british accent
[19534.76s -> 19538.12s]  and with their twinkle sounds made and my eyes kind of glazed over
[19539.16s -> 19573.84s]  that is what i'm looking for where is this thing star wars is too old kids don't get that reference
[19574.24s -> 19586.04s]  what one just came out like a year ago that was the biggest hit 334
[19587.64s -> 19608.48s]  all right unprover leveled up flower dance didn't oh no that was the mushroom why are
[19608.48s -> 19618.60s]  mushrooms just flowers in this game i don't bunny anymore do i no we iced the bunny
[19623.88s -> 19638.44s]  and apparently no apparently you can't cut for this with your sword somehow like digimon world
[19638.92s -> 19659.80s]  that is digimon world is that like an mmo the massive multiplayer game or something
[19670.54s -> 19678.91s]  this should even exist in this game please have this be it that's a document 10
[19683.53s -> 19692.78s]  it's a playstation 1 game it's like this but you explore a world with your monster rancher friend
[19693.66s -> 19714.28s]  i can't progress anymore i have to go all the way around it's one of my favorite games
[19714.36s -> 19720.65s]  i'll check it out am i looking for the mushrooms now i'm looking for this
[19720.65s -> 19725.29s]  specific junk that this guy wants so i can participate in the city tournament
[19736.32s -> 19747.63s]  digimon world is amazing but you hatch eggs it's like this and you get to watch your monsters poop
[19747.63s -> 19769.31s]  everywhere i love how that's a selling point that's perfect for you you definitely won't check it out
[19769.31s -> 19779.52s]  by the way well why wouldn't i just because i check it out doesn't mean i'm gonna play it
[19779.52s -> 19786.89s]  i'm gonna check it out that means i'm gonna open up a tab type in digimon world watch like a trailer
[19787.53s -> 19804.46s]  look up reviews and then decide you know what that sounds good feels so good when you insta kill
[19805.26s -> 19819.71s]  the fart streamer is judging a poop game we already talked about that why that wasn't the
[19819.71s -> 19849.93s]  reason why i thought that was so funny you're putting words in my ears that's fine yes words
[19849.93s -> 19856.80s]  in my ears you're currently putting words into my ears and i don't not like them i don't like
[19856.80s -> 19884.12s]  hearing them great wing probably trait great wing our moves that use the wings you guys don't have
[19884.12s -> 19890.99s]  the twitch integration uh better twitch.tv notification sound thing every time a line
[19890.99s -> 19901.00s]  of chat comes i can hear you guys because i want to make sure i know when a chat message comes
[19901.00s -> 19925.21s]  through every time almost level six for unprover i really don't know what this is
[19927.45s -> 19936.57s]  it's causing me anguish yeah i get an email every time there's a chat message twitch sends
[19936.57s -> 19952.06s]  me a notification it's hard though i mean i'd like to know exactly when in the time the date
[19952.06s -> 19957.37s]  stamped when i get a chat message in my chat room but it can be hard because you know my bank
[19957.37s -> 19964.46s]  statements are on that same email so uh credit card like it's all there so i have to like skim
[19964.46s -> 19970.44s]  through like once every couple months and i'm really trying to see like bank like info i have
[19970.44s -> 19996.68s]  to sift through like 800 to 900 000 emails unprover mastered helicopter somebody said you know you can
[19996.68s -> 20005.05s]  just search emails what is the search box i don't have i just i just killed a fucking new
[20005.05s -> 20011.00s]  anime i didn't see what it was because i've been one hitting everything i don't know what that
[20011.00s -> 20027.36s]  monster was golden foot and flutter can i walk forward five feet without this happening
[20036.70s -> 20050.73s]  i mean i guess i was farming experience everyone write messages with the word bank so he can't
[20050.73s -> 20051.21s]  find them
[20054.52s -> 20061.69s]  if only that were real bang yeah i'll just search the word bank and i'll find it
[20063.07s -> 20086.36s]  search result turned up 41 000 entries the place to dig you suck unprover two in a row
[20087.72s -> 20117.85s]  important info please open give me the junk oh come on can i even do this
[20118.57s -> 20148.33s]  is this something i can physically do all the way down is that a timer uh it's an energy meter

[20367.08s -> 20379.26s]  where is this stupid item why is this part of the game gated i just want to take him to a tournament
[20389.34s -> 20394.22s]  all right third time's charm is your last chance if you don't get this i'm actually going to freeze
[20394.22s -> 20426.16s]  you nice knowing you fifty thousand dollars has been transferred to stir you did not complete this
[20426.16s -> 20431.69s]  transaction please contact city bank customer service um that's no that's real that's weird
[20431.69s -> 20438.22s]  that's in twitch chat that's real okay i don't know what that's weird that pops up here though
[20447.37s -> 20459.98s]  keen fang trample machine gun machine let me see what that looks like
[20463.12s -> 20470.89s]  so let's see machine gun critical hit rate is a all right maybe i'm not going to put you into
[20470.89s -> 20479.02s]  the friar lady again all right machine gun is long range so it takes 40 guts to do that
[20479.02s -> 20496.54s]  accuracy is terrible the dance flower dance it's a charm all right well let's uh get dirt search
[20496.54s -> 20503.50s]  already keen fang of course that's what it means uh you got something new too you got trample
[20505.26s -> 20514.06s]  uh this is really good tons of guts damage massive crit rating tons of damage
[20514.06s -> 20518.78s]  actual to health and not terrible accuracy takes 34 guts to do is it long range
[20519.42s -> 20531.00s]  uh this is my flutter is a super accurate move i'm not sure what this it might be a status effect
[20532.76s -> 20537.88s]  we also have detail trample uh detail
[20541.88s -> 20547.29s]  i guess i could put it on the last row flutter is a slow that's cool
[20547.29s -> 20593.48s]  what's the best breakfast food whoa this is your animal you got jigglypuff
[20598.73s -> 20603.69s]  we stole all your money well that would be impossible considering i don't have any money
[20604.89s -> 20613.37s]  every set that i make i buy gold bars and i scrape the gold into small baggies you just take a knife
[20613.37s -> 20620.01s]  and you scrape scrape scrape filings off into ziploc bags and i've stored them all over the world
[20621.53s -> 20639.50s]  only i know where they are everywhere in fact i i've done it so many times that i had originally
[20639.50s -> 20646.92s]  a treasure map that i was going to leave but over time i did it so often that the map got so confusing
[20647.88s -> 20654.89s]  that i don't even know where they are there was circles and x's and i had a globe and it's been
[20654.89s -> 20662.57s]  done eight nine thousand twelve hundred times i only know where two of them are and one of them's
[20662.57s -> 20674.84s]  under my bed but it's only like four dollars worth of gold the other one is under a tree
[20674.84s -> 20680.76s]  i buried it under a tree and it sucks because this is like probably 15 it's probably 15 bucks
[20680.76s -> 20686.60s]  worth of gold under that tree but i i know i can bring it in like the general area of the general
[20686.60s -> 20695.80s]  forest of what tree it was but i couldn't point at which one it was i was quick fucked up for
[20695.80s -> 20717.69s]  some reason like i i i ubered here i just ubered to the forest nice story now shut up and keep
[20717.69s -> 20738.88s]  playing hey you shut up and keep playing we got a boss coming okay fine pass the controller here
[20738.88s -> 20753.40s]  take it let me talk about my gold filings while you beat the boss in one hit there's a lot of
[20753.40s -> 20779.05s]  help oh fuck i'm gonna die this is baby grute hey shut up do die you shut up employing the use of
[20779.05s -> 20784.25s]  eighth grade at the lunch table insults that's you know that's how you know it's going real well
[20787.58s -> 20807.92s]  uh stray monster left something behind it's gonna be the junk yes wonder what it is well whatever

[20813.04s -> 20839.45s]  took long enough all right
[20844.88s -> 20850.99s]  let me save the game that took over 30 minutes took longer than that
[20852.51s -> 20860.46s]  we got a game wall put in front of us to go walk around in circles to find this junk
[20869.66s -> 20871.93s]  i think now i can get this done let me see
[20872.49s -> 20880.49s]  i'm really tired you are you rest
[20882.65s -> 20885.85s]  you rest too you can do target no you do something else
[20886.73s -> 20907.77s]  life maybe i don't need any more accuracy it's perfect that's better uh you hungry
[20907.77s -> 20920.44s]  i'm hungry not particularly all right let's go to the town see if i can actually do this
[20920.44s -> 20936.01s]  yes association and oh are you fain who i've been hearing about and is that little rio

[20975.32s -> 20980.43s]  best young star then nobody can argue that he doesn't deserve a license he wants me and her
[20980.43s -> 20991.95s]  to fight an all-or-nothing single match with philia i'm you want to fight her hardly seems like a
[20991.95s -> 21010.64s]  little test but i accept the challenge yes okay show me what you got fain this is gonna be easy
[21010.64s -> 21026.28s]  i'll take the license now please thank you can i have it now or is there gonna be a fourth test
[21026.28s -> 21034.67s]  or quest i have to go in before i can continue to play the game now there's no question i present
[21034.67s -> 21040.11s]  you with a license and rank c reader status from this day you are an official fimb of breeder
[21041.07s -> 21044.83s]  congrats now you can enter the real competition yes i can thanks rio now i can enter the same
[21044.83s -> 21051.82s]  competition as graham and philia philia ever since fain left school for such a reason
[21052.38s -> 21059.45s]  i never never thought i'd have a chance to fight you again i'm so glad philia thank you next we
[21059.45s -> 21063.61s]  meet in the official competition where i will want to kill you monster again and this time
[21063.61s -> 21067.05s]  it'll be even more embarrassing because there are going to be three people watching this is
[21067.05s -> 21079.53s]  going to be 300 000 people watching good luck why was i kicked out of school i wonder if philia
[21079.53s -> 21092.20s]  knows the reason all right let's enter that tournament with roberto
[21107.64s -> 21110.84s]  hello there fan congratulations i heard you earned your breeder certification
[21112.20s -> 21117.05s]  thanks it wouldn't have happened without you caesar i didn't do much you earned this by your
[21117.05s -> 21121.93s]  own accord i just provided an opportunity for you well now that you're an official breeder
[21122.73s -> 21129.72s]  i'll be sure to ask for your help and you too rio yes father with that in mind i figure it's
[21129.72s -> 21137.16s]  about time you expanded the ranch a bit told you to come by next week coming by again expanding
[21137.88s -> 21148.01s]  can't wait till next week so we're gonna get a bigger ranch read chat members
[21150.04s -> 21151.74s]  we can now enter the competition
[21154.38s -> 21164.33s]  why did i read that it was weird all right um let's see when is the official competition
[21165.60s -> 21171.52s]  it's coming up right i don't need to do this one i already did it so we're gonna this is four
[21171.52s -> 21178.40s]  thousand dollars a cake i think we'll be ready let's get some more life life twice rest and then
[21178.40s -> 21190.84s]  maybe let's see 342 power which is unmatched probably need a little bit more life and maybe
[21190.84s -> 21196.59s]  some more defense because i yeah i need more defense because i just got that stupid trait
[21197.15s -> 21210.24s]  that makes me take more damage from power attacks so defense and life let's just do life now
[21211.72s -> 21213.88s]  life rest life defense
[21216.36s -> 21224.96s]  probably defense probably rest well let's see this might be a little too much
[21226.88s -> 21244.83s]  target and then that's fine book and then we'll just see what it looks like i feel like i have
[21244.83s -> 21251.15s]  some speed otherwise a cc train is gonna hit you hard yeah that's true what is the speed
[21251.87s -> 21252.75s]  is pretty bad isn't it
[21268.54s -> 21272.38s]  i need more food too i will get that after the end of this
[21278.54s -> 21293.10s]  don't have any more food that you can eat um six mangoes so i got a little bit fine you're fine
[21293.10s -> 21302.11s]  you also need mango no wrong person come here i feel like very slowly without paying attention
[21302.11s -> 21318.36s]  he's getting really really really insane stats let me look he's coming along 200 intelligence
[21319.66s -> 21326.78s]  i need way more health and accuracy though is the act okay that might look bad at first glance
[21326.78s -> 21341.34s]  here but remember the accuracy was below 60 or something it was horrible he looks pretty good
[21341.34s -> 21348.80s]  too my intelligence i wish i could just skip tournaments because these guys have to fight
[21348.80s -> 21357.26s]  down at the e-rank but maybe not maybe i'll just keep them for exploring and just not even have
[21357.26s -> 21368.00s]  him just be the tournament one because it almost feels like that's too much to do
[21372.64s -> 21377.84s]  they're going for like three hours how's Roberto he's been pretty good
[21382.84s -> 21389.24s]  so you actually sell meat it's very expensive but you still sell it
[21390.22s -> 21401.04s]  beef 500 that's so much squid let's get a bunch of these and did i say that correctly that's
[21401.12s -> 21408.25s]  eating screws why would i feed screws to my animals
[21412.35s -> 21417.87s]  it seems kind of insane i'm gonna buy a couple of beefs just for the purpose of making sure
[21419.63s -> 21421.87s]  people are taken care of but get some more bananas
[21424.75s -> 21436.99s]  feed it to the robot should feed it up the robot a screw
[21437.07s -> 21462.32s]  oh robots don't eat screws they might okay here i am again long time no see and feign how do
[21462.32s -> 21468.72s]  you manage to make so much progress in such a short while very loud laugh i'm nothing compared
[21468.72s -> 21476.70s]  to you you you've even got the talk down buddy well then we're going to get this done in the
[21476.70s -> 21494.06s]  jiffy just like last time we're doing this in one week all right boys thank you you okay so that
[21494.06s -> 21501.47s]  gives us another session here you can do this one more time and then rest here so let's do
[21501.47s -> 21515.07s]  like play again rest and then you need to let's do book again no let's do target target book and then
[21515.07s -> 21522.75s]  rest you need to do book
[21525.15s -> 21537.39s]  probably rest all right reberto is probably gonna just i'm gonna do speed now
[21538.19s -> 21546.20s]  i gotta put the trampoline back here though that's what speed is he's tired now
[21554.73s -> 21559.13s]  what disc did that dragon come from it came from jackass the video game for playstation 2
[21561.44s -> 21580.65s]  all right relax now this should be the end of the week let's see what happens
[21583.76s -> 21594.03s]  that just about wraps things up what do you think does this suit your tastes
[21595.47s -> 21601.00s]  view is really nice okay next is the house and hut like before tell me where you want me to put
[21601.00s -> 21609.32s]  them i gotta figure yard now back here great house
[21609.32s -> 21612.04s]  nice
[21615.21s -> 21618.17s]  okay and then a great hut
[21622.96s -> 21627.68s]  nice no no no i want okay i gotta put some more shit here
[21628.80s -> 21631.82s]  i'm gonna put i have the sandbag already out here i need the trampoline
[21635.82s -> 21638.78s]  let's move some of this stuff out of the way let's get this over here is the tub
[21638.78s -> 21645.90s]  is the life blade all the ones that are small go in the same spot here you turn this way
[21647.58s -> 21650.30s]  another single right which one of these is single this is
[21657.95s -> 21661.79s]  this that something else can go here
[21661.79s -> 21665.15s]  monster
[21668.51s -> 21671.15s]  sandbag book target what am i missing
[21675.71s -> 21677.55s]  that's it right yeah that's everything
[21680.35s -> 21702.51s]  all right five monsters can live in the hut oh god five more jesus or a five total
[21704.35s -> 21713.50s]  this is gonna get overwhelming here all right rest tub right when is the official tournament
[21713.50s -> 21721.61s]  the next week is everybody tired right now
[21724.25s -> 21732.06s]  uh rest for everybody rest rest rest and we'll take a look tomorrow see if i can pull him out
[21732.06s -> 21740.33s]  of this and get to b rank before the stream comes to a close here six hours into this
[21740.33s -> 21752.91s]  hopefully i can get him i probably i'm gonna do speed so many managements good luck feeding
[21752.91s -> 21757.15s]  all of them yeah i wish i could hire somebody to come feed them and do you know i wish i
[21757.15s -> 21764.40s]  could have somebody feed them no i don't give him beef he's not hungry he's hungry enough for
[21764.40s -> 21777.69s]  like a mango i feel like i'm gonna accidentally neglect at least two or three of the monsters
[21777.69s -> 21780.25s]  that are here i'm already having trouble dealing with these two or three
[21786.64s -> 21797.80s]  here have a squid disc time before i call it yeah i'll uh i'll after i do this next
[21797.80s -> 21800.28s]  tournament we'll see if we can get something else because that means i would have unlocked
[21800.28s -> 21817.76s]  another set of monsters right getting to b rank all right let's go well i have to you have to get
[21817.76s -> 21842.67s]  to b rank that's another thing tub he's um he'll be fine nice okay decent defense now he's doing
[21842.75s -> 21853.18s]  okay let's praise him and then go win imagine having to make five individual training schedules
[21853.18s -> 21859.20s]  and make sure all your monsters participate in tournaments that's a little too much
[21862.48s -> 21877.92s]  thanks for the stream thanks for watching no problem okay weekend oh no no no not yet
[21878.00s -> 21889.55s]  yeah you're fine all right c cup official c cup moving on to nearly the end of the cups here
[21890.19s -> 21903.96s]  i'm almost gonna be in b and there's a the final is this the fight that is your key to success
[21904.84s -> 21917.63s]  reverto versus ropez pretty strong intelligence but not even close to matching my sheer just
[21917.63s -> 21928.06s]  absolute dominating step hope my advice wasn't annoying no not at all these games are really
[21928.06s -> 21936.86s]  strange and they have a lot of weird particular things so that's fine i'm just kidding around
[21936.86s -> 21945.48s]  when i go back and forth about you know saying random things about the game and i'm just messing
[21945.48s -> 21953.92s]  around i don't think i said anything that but hopefully you don't feel that way here we go
[21953.92s -> 21969.79s]  you know how it's gonna end good start you want to back it up fine air shot i'll take it
[21977.72s -> 21988.32s]  i can't wait for him to win again dodongo versus sherry bundy versus alaman
[21988.32s -> 21998.94s]  dodongo versus ropez ropez looks like you're not gonna win this all right sherry
[22000.06s -> 22013.95s]  you got sherry is pretty scary my intelligence is so low and smoke bomb crescent lightning meteor
[22014.83s -> 22017.72s]  i cannot get hit by one of those up i'll die in one hit
[22036.11s -> 22050.19s]  again quick thank god you just gotta go in you gotta do the front flip move into the slash
[22050.83s -> 22072.04s]  okay reverto versus alaman not that scary but is not gonna miss and dodge a lot of shit
[22074.48s -> 22085.90s]  i'm not gonna go in uh with the typical guaranteed victory button i need something
[22085.90s -> 22095.10s]  that's gonna hit that's 55 70 here we go that's my way no see i guess that one right
[22095.90s -> 22128.04s]  didn't get that one it's a lot of damage it's a lot of overkill but i did it all right bundy
[22128.04s -> 22132.94s]  and dodongo are the ones to worry about these are the ones that are winning no sherry wins
[22133.66s -> 22139.64s]  so dodongo and alaman let's see dodongo is one of those huge rock monsters
[22140.83s -> 22154.91s]  that might be bad for me because all i have a power moves that are really any good decent but
[22155.63s -> 22169.24s]  high health how does counter work uh you can either press x square or circle to do a move
[22170.04s -> 22176.28s]  x is standard square is power and circle is i believe a better chance to hit like lighter
[22177.00s -> 22181.96s]  so when they do a move i have to just guess which one they're doing there's no indicator of which
[22181.96s -> 22189.87s]  it is i have to just do a one out of three chance to get it and if i miss it then i get hit but if
[22189.87s -> 22197.45s]  i counter it i actually the move doesn't work and i hit them that's not good bad start
[22200.12s -> 22218.32s]  holy shit that was okay i pressed square on that that was a power move so dodongo is the only thing
[22218.32s -> 22222.56s]  if dodongo loses here to bundy then i automatically will win the tournament
[22225.29s -> 22245.77s]  that ain't gonna happen though god damn it well let's see 336 power 355 health 272 defense
[22247.50s -> 22256.01s]  oh boy this is gonna be bad low intelligence but so do i i don't my intelligence moves aren't good
[22256.01s -> 22266.48s]  enough to do my speed is awful too this guy's just a better version of me i have to work i'm
[22266.48s -> 22272.27s]  gonna try to counter why you punks you've come out of your hole have you i've been waiting for you
[22272.75s -> 22279.10s]  i couldn't beat you at school but with my new dodongo i'm unbeatable besides i want to impress
[22279.10s -> 22287.02s]  phillias so i mean no forget what i just said i won't pull any punches this time it really is
[22287.02s -> 22293.60s]  just me but stronger i have a little bit more power but he's way more health i have to rely on
[22293.60s -> 22316.72s]  getting a good counter let's try it start like maybe i could just bully him knock it knock it
[22321.00s -> 22332.64s]  oh boy i have to hit him hit him with something come on again hailberry do it oh again do it
[22336.67s -> 22339.71s]  yes oh my god
[22339.71s -> 22367.31s]  see i'm telling you it's gonna be the big guys that do one single move that lands b rank 4000
[22367.31s -> 22386.17s]  gold and a cake you are almost as famous as you can ever possibly be he's an anime protagonist
[22386.17s -> 22395.24s]  it's not fair he never loses congratulations on your victory nice fighting now do you have a
[22395.24s -> 22403.28s]  moment to speak with me sure what is it your victory proves that you too are top class breeders
[22403.92s -> 22407.04s]  and your search in the jungle has proved that you are excellent investigators
[22408.08s -> 22416.25s]  and so i have a very important favor that i'd like to ask of you sounds awfully important yes
[22416.25s -> 22423.29s]  well we at femba sent an investigation team out to the jungle but they haven't returned
[22424.76s -> 22429.80s]  are they lost we don't know with some breeders who have gone exploring have not come back as well
[22430.52s -> 22434.43s]  and so i wish to rely on you with your skills find out what's going on in there
[22435.31s -> 22446.88s]  understood excellent you're a great help i'm just not going in there you deserve a rest
[22448.48s -> 22454.03s]  let's see here b rank now it's just to get real
[22456.86s -> 22464.19s]  five thousand dollars melons salmon all right let's see let's try it this is the real deal
[22464.19s -> 22470.68s]  this is the one thing this is a real game no mistakes allowed up here so Roberto's gonna try
[22470.68s -> 22472.84s]  it let's save the game
[22490.25s -> 22498.30s]  so that last encounter was a little bit of a wake-up call that i need much more power
[22498.94s -> 22506.49s]  and more defense because if i'm gonna trade blows then i better have at least two to 220
[22506.49s -> 22525.24s]  something plus 250 defense because at this point he's got another probably year plus of life
[22527.63s -> 22533.63s]  and i think it's time that we get to like 450 power and actually just try to one hit kill our
[22533.63s -> 22543.00s]  way to the top because spreading out here to intelligence and speed and i think we just have
[22543.00s -> 22562.64s]  to do like 400 power and just do the one hit kill move i'm gonna get to 400 power
[22566.62s -> 22567.74s]  and see where i'm at after that
[22567.74s -> 22571.72s]  that sandbag
[22573.55s -> 22577.47s]  no no no rest right you just you just want a tournament sandbag
[22582.00s -> 22587.68s]  uh let's see sandbag again put a rest in there
[22589.68s -> 22592.56s]  target that's fine uh you can do
[22592.56s -> 22610.99s]  you can do the speed nice can i get the new equipment yet uh i think i think that guy has
[22610.99s -> 22615.07s]  to show up he shows up like once every uh once every few months right once a month
[22621.12s -> 22629.00s]  you need to eat you need to eat too do you know you're fine did i save yeah i saved i got a
[22629.00s -> 22651.24s]  save point uh here's a banana okay i just want to see just how dangerous everybody is here
[22652.20s -> 22668.96s]  i can join no this is group battle oh you gotta be kidding me tag battle
[22671.60s -> 22685.23s]  i have to get somebody else leveled up and ranked up i can't just do it with can i enter this with
[22685.23s -> 22697.76s]  one person i really wish i didn't have to because i'll tell you here's a complaint about monster
[22697.84s -> 22704.96s]  ranch before at this point do do i really need to beat three of these to do an official tournament
[22704.96s -> 22710.16s]  like one of these you know i mean i shouldn't be able to go to one of these like that i should
[22710.16s -> 22716.00s]  be able to i feel like that's added shit for no reason because i'm just gonna go through here
[22716.00s -> 22722.09s]  because my stats are so high i'm just gonna wipe the floor with everybody here with the dragon
[22722.41s -> 22731.53s]  okay if you fuse roberto the fusion will keep its rank that's actually really good to know
[22735.10s -> 22738.70s]  well it's not that i want to cheat with the wolf i just i really don't want to do three
[22739.58s -> 22743.23s]  cloth league tournaments to do the actual tournament
[22746.78s -> 22763.20s]  all right what do we got all right let's get some training done 12 more power slowly climbing away
[22763.20s -> 22775.42s]  over 400 let's give you some more meat and i got some squid here what about the cake
[22776.22s -> 22781.63s]  from the finest bakery it tastes as good as it looks no you get that's a that's a really special
[22781.63s -> 22804.38s]  thing okay have a squid good where's the other guy all right always hungry
[22806.46s -> 22813.72s]  fusing a b tier with an e tier is probably not going to be as good as if you fuse it with
[22813.72s -> 22831.24s]  something else so this is kind of how the game works i guess is so you get this guy
[22831.96s -> 22838.28s]  up to like b rank he's gonna die right so in another year he's dead before he dies
[22839.00s -> 22848.24s]  you freeze him and then you level up somebody else and get them to like cb rank fuse them together
[22850.28s -> 22854.60s]  and then start that person over with insane stats and then they can just grind up to
[22854.60s -> 22860.62s]  s rank that's how it works right for the most part but then this game they have to be friends
[22861.50s -> 22870.43s]  so how does that even work didn't didn't somebody say that they have to be friends with each other
[22871.07s -> 22885.60s]  so can i freeze him and just keep him here let me take a look monster like bonding right
[22887.50s -> 22894.46s]  i mean reverto is really bonded with me but how do i make him friends with somebody else
[22894.46s -> 22896.06s]  they have to like work together or something
[22902.19s -> 22919.18s]  data school land fame raised after i how have i raised seven flowers competitions one affinity
[22921.71s -> 22934.73s]  so good friend friend they're friends great friend i gotta get the dragon up
[22938.11s -> 22941.87s]  the dragon i don't the dragon just has to be leveled up and
[22941.95s -> 22953.84s]  fused together in the time that he still has left yeah after you fuse them they become
[22953.84s -> 22966.11s]  inseparable that's true let's keep moving having five monsters on a farm should be priority number
[22966.11s -> 22971.08s]  one i guess that because then they can all be friends i guess
[22973.64s -> 22979.88s]  yeah all right let's i got up to b rank i think that i'm gonna call it here well not yet i'm
[22979.88s -> 22987.31s]  gonna make two more monsters get them on the farm save it and then we'll call it there so this
[22987.31s -> 22991.72s]  should take us another like probably 30 minutes or so let's get some new monsters let's see how
[22991.72s -> 23004.16s]  it's gonna look does it matter what town i go to well or what shrine i go to i just don't know

[23658.16s -> 23665.20s]  you'll get an ad but during the stream you should never see an ad i don't run them i don't think

[23907.42s -> 23944.67s]  now i can only run a break every eight minutes run a three minute ad block all right no no shroom
[23945.23s -> 23974.96s]  it's not a fake disc it's right here well that's how we do it that is a stone beetle that's a very
[23974.96s -> 23981.04s]  cool monster yes i'll take this one
[24011.47s -> 24013.39s]  ad block or ad rock
[24019.66s -> 24022.30s]  and every time he shows up every time he lands a move i run an ad
[24022.62s -> 24029.24s]  and twitch channel i swear to god
[24044.04s -> 24052.19s]  there it is the sound is decent like in the game the audio that shouldn't be
[24057.60s -> 24064.41s]  every win with ad rock run a three minute ad i mean we actually do joke around about this but
[24065.21s -> 24069.37s]  there are there's okay let's just put it this way there's probably a bunch of people here
[24069.45s -> 24074.94s]  that are just hanging out and watching you just maybe just sitting there just chilling oh this
[24074.94s -> 24078.22s]  is a monster at your four stream i'll just turn this one on you know what i mean this is fun that
[24078.22s -> 24084.49s]  sounds fun you're not chatting you're just kind of hanging out yeah if you get three straight minutes
[24084.49s -> 24090.41s]  of ads you're going to leave you're gonna go okay this is uh he's doing like a joke thing
[24090.97s -> 24094.49s]  and like yeah hey everyone's in on it this is like kind of funny but like fuck three minutes of ads
[24094.49s -> 24106.17s]  like i'm gonna leave nobody wants that nobody wants to see that we need a timer until the next
[24114.16s -> 24119.23s]  all right well i did say that that was going to be it we've been going just about seven hours i'm
[24119.23s -> 24129.18s]  going to call it here it would be funny at first and then after the third or fourth time would be
[24129.18s -> 24139.15s]  like i'm sick of hearing the same loud totino's pizza roll ad over and over again oh i do want
[24139.15s -> 24158.19s]  to see their stats that was just an ad no it wasn't that was me telling you that not to watch
[24158.19s -> 24167.88s]  look at how many people are here all right let's see what are the base stats on blossom not bad
[24168.36s -> 24179.90s]  almost 150 speed 140 intelligence that rock is 147 power pretty terrible actually besides the power
[24180.94s -> 24192.76s]  let me get the moves scissors and whirlwind lots of guts damage what about blossom
[24192.92s -> 24213.24s]  so scratch and hawaiian and a for guts damage hawaiian okay what about traits sweet voice
[24214.04s -> 24224.19s]  increase power boobs that use the voice add rock sounds like malware it probably is but that's
[24224.19s -> 24230.94s]  gonna be it guys here's the plan i'm gonna tell you the plan there's a possibility here so we got
[24230.94s -> 24233.50s]  a lot of random things that are going to be happening over the next few days
[24234.78s -> 24244.70s]  monster rancher 4 a yay or an a from monster rancher 4 continuing this i still fun we got a
[24244.70s -> 24253.40s]  yay thing probably i think people are having fun people enjoying this i am we have our dream team
[24253.40s -> 24263.60s]  here let me save it i think it's fun yeah i'm having a great time i feel like i'm gonna get
[24263.60s -> 24275.20s]  really irritated at the countering system but you know it's fine you're asking the people that stuck
[24275.20s -> 24285.69s]  around for seven hours yeah the best people to ask but even though this is that yeah fuck
[24285.69s -> 24293.36s]  it i'll do it that sounds fun we'll do it again but in between the next stream is probably not
[24293.36s -> 24299.56s]  going to be monster range for there's the scratch ticket stream for sekiro that's going to take me
[24299.56s -> 24303.24s]  at least like an hour or two to scratch those i already got confirmation with twitch that that
[24303.24s -> 24309.64s]  should be fine you don't know what that what's happening there for every time i died in sekiro
[24309.64s -> 24317.16s]  i'm buying that amount monetarily in scratch tickets so whether it's a bunch of ten dollar
[24317.16s -> 24322.36s]  five dollar equaling two hundred and twenty one dollars i'm going to scratch all those tickets
[24322.36s -> 24331.40s]  on stream and whatever happens through those tickets is going to go right to charity if i
[24331.40s -> 24337.08s]  don't win anything if it's zero i'm going to donate two hundred and twenty one dollars
[24337.64s -> 24351.90s]  to that charity anyways so winner lose that was something that why wait why 221 i died 221 times
[24351.90s -> 24357.44s]  in sekiro and said that i was going to get a scratch ticket for every death even if it's a
[24357.44s -> 24363.21s]  million dollars yes if i hit a million dollars on one of these scratch tickets the charity is
[24363.21s -> 24376.52s]  getting a million dollars that's just going to happen why did you die that much all right whatever
[24378.11s -> 24383.07s]  it's gonna be funny when you only donate six dollars because you only win six dollars but that
[24383.07s -> 24391.53s]  i just told you i'm going regardless of anything i'm going to donate at least 221 dollars like if i
[24398.86s -> 24403.02s]  scratch up like hundreds of dollars worth of tickets you win like eight bucks all right
[24403.02s -> 24418.75s]  eight dollars is going here no it would be so it would be dumb but that's the plan that's
[24418.75s -> 24436.14s]  including revives now they they kept track there was a the actual deaths i think please
[24436.14s -> 24438.78s]  do a three minute ad i would love to see some products to buy
[24445.72s -> 24452.86s]  uh so the charity that i'm going to choose i have not decided yet uh i have narrowed it down to a
[24452.86s -> 24469.79s]  few what about taxes okay so that's whatever i can so okay let's say i on stream hit like
[24470.75s -> 24475.31s]  this is not this is probably not going to happen but like if i win like 50 grand on a scratch
[24475.31s -> 24481.50s]  ticket on stream i i don't know how taxes work with that i don't know this is a question for
[24481.50s -> 24492.52s]  my cpa because if i win 50 grand on a scratch ticket a bunch of that's taxed so then i would
[24492.52s -> 24498.41s]  have to pay taxes on that but i would give it to be given it to charity but charity is deductible
[24498.41s -> 24510.00s]  from taxes but was that with that count as income i would be getting 50 grand of income and writing
[24510.00s -> 24522.00s]  off 50 grand of income how does that work i'm gonna okay i'm gonna i gotta call my cpa about
[24522.00s -> 24530.00s]  this he's gonna think i'm fucking insane hey so i have a question for you if i buy
[24531.04s -> 24536.88s]  200 dollars worth of scratch tickets and i win 50 grand and give 50 grand of charity what happens
[24536.88s -> 24552.27s]  to my income he's probably gonna go what the fuck are you talking about he's probably gonna
[24552.27s -> 24571.39s]  hang up on me he's watching now no do that voice on the phone hey i got a question for you
[24575.31s -> 24588.04s]  all right that's it let's get out of here thanks for hanging out everybody i'll see you guys in a
[24588.04s -> 24596.48s]  couple days i'll see you on thursday so this i depending on what happens italics and i were
[24596.48s -> 24601.44s]  going to play risk of rain two together we're thinking about doing that monster rancher four
[24601.44s -> 24607.76s]  has to continue sakiro scratch off to charity stream has to do has to be there and then something
[24607.76s -> 24615.56s]  else and i mean well look i'll just say i'll just tell you what it is i'm gonna play the uh the germa
[24615.56s -> 24625.96s]  game on stream it's coming out real soon prepare for that it's gonna be it's gonna be real soon
[24633.18s -> 24642.48s]  on pc yep on pc does that include ads no risk of rain two is very very good
[24643.20s -> 24648.48s]  yeah so but we'll jumble it around but that's what you can expect over this next uh week or so
[24649.04s -> 24656.70s]  general roll the ads oh okay i'll do the three minutes of ads at the end of the stream before i
[24656.70s -> 24662.80s]  leave because i want everyone that does not want to see three minutes of ads to have an opportunity
[24662.80s -> 24676.27s]  to just leave so we're gonna do the bits let's go back uh about seven plus hours ago just about
[24676.27s -> 24688.48s]  seven hours ago to the beginning and it was lazy luke thanks for the 250 lazy luke they say germa
[24688.48s -> 24697.32s]  heart it's all thank you for the 250 thank you also to uh tingy for the 250 if you do have the
[24697.32s -> 24700.68s]  scratch ticket stream sometime this week and please be on the weekend i don't want to miss
[24700.68s -> 24708.54s]  it due to work it'll probably end up being let me just try to think this through here
[24709.42s -> 24716.06s]  so nothing tomorrow on wednesday and then thursday friday saturday all right i would probably do
[24717.92s -> 24726.33s]  saturday might be a really weird stream because saturday might turn out to be
[24727.29s -> 24737.37s]  the sakiro scratch off and the germa slot game stream because i feel like that would be a whole
[24737.37s -> 24746.88s]  stream worth of stuff to do because i feel like the scratching the tickets is going to take probably
[24746.88s -> 24751.84s]  like an hour plus and then that a game is going to take a couple hours probably or an hour plus
[24752.96s -> 24765.87s]  i feel like that makes sense to have those be on the same day you know one can kind of prelude to
[24765.95s -> 24774.75s]  the other sounds like a plan and then that makes thursday and friday monster rancher 4 will come
[24774.75s -> 24780.27s]  back if not thursday then friday and if me and italics play risk of rain then we'll continue
[24780.27s -> 24787.68s]  monster rancher 4 on friday so you can probably assume risk of rain 2 monster rancher 4 and the
[24787.68s -> 24804.49s]  weird like irl gambling stream somehow sounds good so expect that on saturday you did spend
[24804.49s -> 24812.48s]  six hours trying to build a bird house that's true was that six hours is gambling against the
[24812.48s -> 24819.71s]  tos now i actually i talked to two twitch staff about this and as long as gambling is legal in
[24819.71s -> 24825.96s]  your area in your state it's fine i mean especially considering that whatever money i would win
[24826.68s -> 24838.09s]  would just be going to charity there's i mean guys i live in las vegas is gambling legal in nevada
[24838.09s -> 24845.21s]  let me check let me ask one of the 300 casinos that are within a 15 mile radius of where i'm
[24845.21s -> 24857.58s]  standing right now do i still have the bird house uh i don't think i do i may have i may have thrown
[24857.58s -> 24861.90s]  that away i think i had like no actually you know i just i think it is still down downstairs
[24863.13s -> 24873.52s]  i think it's still there but thank you tingy probably see you on saturday for that thank you
[24873.60s -> 24883.40s]  heretic for the five dollars jeremy you've been consistently enjoyable to watch and listen to

[24947.77s -> 24953.61s]  i just want to know how you like to watch your movies i like to watch my movies in an empty
[24953.61s -> 24964.24s]  theater because anytime i go to a movie that's packed it's always been one of those scenarios
[24964.24s -> 24976.38s]  where every possible moment for somebody to scream yeah oh whoa what the whoa like spider-man shows
[24976.38s -> 24981.64s]  up for the first time and it's like the spider spider-man whoo it's like we all know he's in the

[25018.64s -> 25026.40s]  because uh because of they want to make sure that there's not enough not a lot of noise in the
[25026.40s -> 25033.92s]  theater you know what i mean i see what exactly what you mean by that because you just because
[25033.92s -> 25038.48s]  it could get loud in the theater and you should be like easier to hear and stuff that's why i know
[25038.48s -> 25050.62s]  exactly what you're talking about thank you people clap during the theater what are you clapping for

[26975.66s -> 26981.31s]  diablo 2 for hours would you ever consider playing it or something like it on stream
[26981.31s -> 26987.60s]  i don't i don't think so the last game that i played that was a isometric rpg like that was
[26987.60s -> 26994.46s]  grim don and i played it through the third act it was before it was all done and i never went
[26994.46s -> 26998.70s]  back and finished it but i don't think i would stream a game like that a game like that is
[26998.70s -> 27010.62s]  probably something i would do just for to kind of chill out and just open my mouth and play a game
[27010.62s -> 27019.58s]  maybe for a chill stream it would make sense but not something that's in the pipeline or anything
[27019.58s -> 27030.64s]  yeah the intermission today was uh kind of threw the whole thing off for a while but it was still
