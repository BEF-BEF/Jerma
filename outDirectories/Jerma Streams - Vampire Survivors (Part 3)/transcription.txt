[2.04s -> 23.99s]  That was a good game. Alright, so what do they update in Vampire Survivors? What's the update? What do they do? Let's see. Should I even look?
[23.99s -> 32.87s]  One stage, one relic access, two minor gameplay mechanics, two new arcana, there's one more rank.
[32.87s -> 42.46s]  Did they add anything? What else did they add? Oh my god, fuck, I hate that there's no noise gate.
[42.46s -> 49.34s]  I do want to turn this down because it's probably going to be pretty loud.
[49.34s -> 60.34s]  There's three new characters and two new evolutions. Really? I turned it down for you but not me.
[60.34s -> 74.38s]  I turned it down for you guys, thank god. Not for me. Okay, let's put that on the screen.
[74.38s -> 109.48s]  Looks good. So what do we got? Okay, anything new? I need to do survive 15 minutes with
[109.48s -> 120.58s]  Consetta. Unlocks shadow pinion. Okay, well that's, who's Consetta? I've done almost everything else.
[120.58s -> 129.11s]  I've played this game by shitload. Find the magic banger. Find and buy the glass
[129.11s -> 140.54s]  visard. Unlocks a merchant. Find and open the coffin in the gallo tower. Okay, we'll go to the tower.
[140.54s -> 145.54s]  There's so much shit to do. Unlock hyper mode for four normal stages. Alright, there's so much more.
[145.54s -> 152.17s]  Alright, let's do this at that one first. So go to the tower. Let's refund. Who do I want to play with?
[152.17s -> 172.25s]  Consetta. Where's Consetta? Consetta? I don't think I have Consetta unlocked. Alright, well we're
[172.25s -> 190.86s]  gonna go with Popia. Popia's got the cool shit. Movement speed, area, cooldown, duration, luck.
[190.86s -> 203.05s]  I have so much fucking money. It's insane. Oh, let's do growth. Revive. Can I? I don't need it.
[203.05s -> 219.86s]  Do I need to revive? Meh. I can almost do everything. Banish, skip, re-roll. I'll do another
[219.86s -> 226.14s]  banish. Another, yeah, another banish. I always use three banishes. Sound pretty good to me. Greed and
[227.02s -> 230.38s]  max health or whatever I can buy. I can't buy anything, so who cares? Alright, let's go.
[230.38s -> 258.18s]  We're gonna go to the tower with Popia. No, you dummy. Okay, the tower. Let's go. I've already
[258.18s -> 279.50s]  turned this up. Feels weird, man. What, what'd I do? That sounds good. Let's do it. Alright, I want
[280.15s -> 290.97s]  uh, garlic. So I'm looking for the question mark. Yeah, I'm going to the question mark,
[290.97s -> 308.58s]  so I gotta go up. I love lightning rod. It's like my favorite move. Feels weird, man. Put the music
[308.58s -> 338.78s]  up louder. Nice face, nerd. You're on Twitch. You're on Twitch, dork. Oh, Laurel. We're all dorks
[338.78s -> 357.82s]  here, okay? We're all geeks, nerds, and dorks. Alright, I'm gonna go up. Not me. Some of us are
[357.82s -> 366.20s]  dweebs. Yeah, well whatever, you know. When was the last time everybody said dork? I feel like,
[366.20s -> 373.46s]  I feel like that's kind of fallen off, right? Oh, shut up, you fucking dork. Yeah, whatever,
[373.46s -> 380.18s]  you fucking geek. I kind of feel like it's, it's got, there's a lot of, uh, I can't, yeah,
[380.18s -> 388.18s]  I feel like, like people don't say it anymore. I feel like if somebody called me a dork, I'd,
[388.82s -> 400.46s]  for a second, I would take a minute and go, hey, like shut up. When are you gonna, I like when you
[400.46s -> 406.60s]  play actual games and not meme shit. You think this is a meme game? This is like one of the best
[406.60s -> 420.70s]  games on Steam right now. Uh, should I get the tiramisu? Nah. Are we talking about the puppet
[420.70s -> 446.57s]  combo stuff? I never played him before. Yeah, Song of Mana again. The camera smudged? What?
[446.57s -> 477.24s]  Was it smudged the whole stream? It was? What the fuck? Uh, garlic again. I gotta remember
[477.24s -> 500.81s]  some of the combos here. I need duration. It's the shadow from the mic. Oh, well that's alright.
[500.81s -> 521.00s]  It's the mic shadow. That's fine. It doesn't make a difference in 160p. That's true.
[522.28s -> 530.62s]  Oh, the cats. Right. Should I get the cats? No, they're kind of terrible. They eat all the food
[531.69s -> 538.71s]  and they attack you. They're terrible. Um, hold on a minute. I need, I only have two more slots.
[539.35s -> 545.35s]  If I'm going to do eight the sparrow, then I need the tiramisu. I think I'm not sure what to do.
[545.91s -> 551.78s]  I think I'm just going to do garlic again. The cat evolution is great. I know, but
[552.42s -> 559.74s]  let's look for the other gun. I can't pick up anything else though. I need the other gun.
[559.74s -> 591.34s]  I'm going for it. I need the tiramisu and the other gun. Whoa, careful. Will this guy die?
[595.29s -> 606.47s]  Zoomer? Binding of Isaac? That's not right. All right. Eight of, eight the sparrow. Yeah,
[606.47s -> 613.42s]  I also upgraded this a lot. Looking for the other gun. This is not even remotely like Binding of
[613.42s -> 630.90s]  Isaac. These guys respawn. It's annoying. Song of Mana again. I think I need to buy, I gotta get
[630.90s -> 656.07s]  curse for that, right? All right. I'm almost there. Don't touch any of these. Ooh. All right.
[656.07s -> 670.58s]  So I want that because I want to evolve the garlic eventually. Turn over the question mark. I know.
[670.58s -> 675.19s]  I'm going, I'm heading up. That's my destination. I should get there soon.
[675.83s -> 683.03s]  Well, I'm going to do this first because I have the evolution for it. So I want to get that
[683.03s -> 707.70s]  quick. Are we there yet? Nope. Not yet. There we go. Duplicator. Lightning. All right. Just don't
[707.70s -> 717.11s]  mess this up. Laurel again. I need Laurel. It's a, I can't play the game without it.
[717.75s -> 734.82s]  Especially after about 10 to 15 minutes. I just bump into so much shit. Oh my God. Oh,
[734.82s -> 780.42s]  it's always Duplicator every time you see it. What's hitting me? Oh shit. Fuck you. All right.
[780.42s -> 790.74s]  Ah, I can't take any of these. Sorry. I need the other gun. We'll do lightning run. Sorry.
[791.38s -> 796.90s]  Someone says, I think I'm going to go to bed. I had a lot of fun interacting with the German 985
[796.90s -> 800.90s]  chat section on Twitch. German 985 was super cool in his exploration of the murder house. I wish I
[800.90s -> 804.74s]  could stay for a while longer, but at last the sleepy time calls to me. Once again, thank you
[804.74s -> 808.58s]  for the awesome live stream, German 985. Good night and sleep well. Well, that was really nice.
[809.78s -> 844.17s]  Hope you have a good sleep too. Ah, pentagram is sick. I'm going to leave that. In fact,
[844.17s -> 849.91s]  let's hang on here for just a second because I'm close to, not really. Just take it.
[850.87s -> 881.40s]  Nevermind. I'm not really that close. I'll get more. Damn it. I need cool down. Bad.
[882.20s -> 911.88s]  There we go. All right. We're good. I can't even walk over here. Let's make a line for the
[911.88s -> 934.46s]  question mark. There's a turkey right there. Looking for curse, the other gun, a tiramisu.
[935.42s -> 957.19s]  I'll take any of those. I might banish something as well to make sure I get something. Banish
[957.27s -> 964.52s]  the copy pastas. I mean, they're going to get banished if they're not careful.
[965.24s -> 979.69s]  I want what was in here. Give me a chest. Did you guys remember the last time I played this a month
[979.69s -> 984.84s]  or two ago and everyone was bat-chesting me because I was playing this? I'm not making that
[984.84s -> 999.93s]  up. I remember that, right? That was a thing, wasn't it? I was getting bat-chested. I think I
[999.93s -> 1058.42s]  heard Otto. Was that Otto? Let me see. I'll be right back. One sec. Yeah, it was. Just give me
[1058.42s -> 1065.69s]  one second. I think he wants maybe some water. He's still kind of getting over the UTI, so
[1065.93s -> 1670.07s]  I just want to make sure that he's good to go. I'll be right back. Okay, I'm back. Hello. Sorry,
[1670.07s -> 1677.35s]  that was so long. That was a long time, but I wanted to make sure he was good to go. And you
[1677.35s -> 1684.90s]  can probably hear him crunching in the background. Yeah, he had to take his antibiotic, so that's
[1684.90s -> 1691.35s]  kind of a little ordeal. He has to take it every 12 hours and it's been almost exactly 12 hours.
[1697.11s -> 1703.22s]  Where's this train wreck of a streamer? What are you talking about? I'm taking care of my dog.
[1704.18s -> 1717.50s]  Give me a sec. Okay, it was a raid. Was there? I'm gonna say a thousand people from Menace.
[1718.14s -> 1726.06s]  Menace Alcamilla. What's going on? Welcome. Thanks for the raid. We're just kind of winding down
[1726.06s -> 1733.67s]  here. Thanks for the raid. Welcome, guys. Playing vampire survivors just for a little bit to wind
[1733.67s -> 1740.94s]  down the night. Yeah, he's good, though. But I wanted to take his antibiotic. He needed to go
[1741.10s -> 1749.24s]  outside. He needed to go pee. He needed to get a special treat for taking his antibiotic. He
[1749.24s -> 1760.15s]  gets a treat and we can go. Let's do it. Hello. Oh, it's been playing this music the whole time,
[1760.15s -> 1777.61s]  hasn't it? It's just been going. All right. Should I pick that up yet? Yeah, whatever. Yes.
[1778.97s -> 1791.72s]  Yes. Really actually not that happy about that. Two of the heart ones. Come on. I need both
[1791.72s -> 1805.34s]  headphones in so I can hear the stereo sound. All right. Song of Man is level eight. I need the
[1805.34s -> 1827.96s]  curse skull, right? I gotta go up. I'm almost there. I need the other one or tiramisu. Either
[1827.96s -> 1847.58s]  one. I don't want it. I don't think I want to take any of these. Maybe the spinach. All right. I need
[1851.69s -> 1858.50s]  the other gun. I need the curse. I could take the spinach or I could just reroll it. That sucks.
[1876.18s -> 1894.44s]  Garlic. I need a curse. Okay. Garlic. Okay. Garlic eight. All right. Good to go. I just need a chest.
[1895.08s -> 1912.12s]  Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday to you. All right. No more farming. Just go up.
[1912.12s -> 1926.04s]  No more farming. It's not my birthday. Is it your birthday? Whose birthday is it? It's not mine. I
[1926.04s -> 1938.30s]  don't want to see this ever again. All right. This is where I'll get it. That's going to drop a chest,
[1938.30s -> 1956.58s]  right? There it is. All right. We got the garlic upgrade. There it is. Soul eater steals hearts.
[1956.58s -> 1975.24s]  Power increases when recovering HP. Let's go. All right. Now I'm going to go up. No more farming. Go.
[1975.88s -> 1991.13s]  Turma, you should be on Cameo. I did Cameo for free. I said a hundred people's names and did
[1991.13s -> 2004.92s]  birthdays or anniversaries or it's still available. I think the website's still up. You didn't say my
[2004.92s -> 2026.74s]  name though. Oh, shit. All right. Almost there. Just keep going. Come on. Give me the other one.
[2026.74s -> 2035.83s]  Well, I got max lightning now. That's good. Just need a chest. Add more names to it.
[2038.78s -> 2066.10s]  Oh, no. No. I don't feel like it. Okay. Here we go. I'm hungry. We're talking about Pizza Hut.
[2066.10s -> 2073.78s]  Five hours ago and now I want it. I just want. I want a large Pizza Hut pizza all for myself.
[2074.50s -> 2096.98s]  Here we go. This would be the lightning upgrade. Should be pretty sick. Should I get this? No,
[2096.98s -> 2110.14s]  I need the other gun. That thing's really cool. That's too bad. No, I probably shouldn't need
[2110.14s -> 2122.31s]  pizza. That's good. Evolve lightning ring. Projectile strike twice. And that's awesome.
[2122.31s -> 2152.38s]  And it's really, really good. Watch it. Here it comes. Boom. Really need the other gun. All right.
[2152.38s -> 2168.39s]  Go get the item. Ate the sparrow. Another one. Durnby, it's 1 a.m. Yeah, I'm not streaming.
[2168.39s -> 2178.42s]  I'm done after this. I'm like, I'll only be live till this is over. That doesn't drop anything.
[2180.62s -> 2198.81s]  I just needed a wind down from the puppet combo insanity. I needed a little wind down. Another
[2198.81s -> 2217.80s]  one. Shit. I guess I could just take the attract orb, but I don't know. Either that or skip.
[2218.44s -> 2222.44s]  The attract orb is just, or I could banish the armor or something. I'm going to banish armor.
[2223.00s -> 2248.81s]  I don't want it. Oh, it's right here. Okay. I'm a sir. What is that? What the hell is this? What
[2248.81s -> 2255.64s]  the hell is this? What did I just do? I don't even know what I just did. Oh, I found it. It's that.
[2256.36s -> 2278.74s]  Okay. So did I do it? Thank you. Pop up for arena. The vampire is at another coffin. There it is.
[2278.82s -> 2293.19s]  Concetta. Very cool. Got it. We'll check out what they do. Try to get the 30 minutes there.
[2293.75s -> 2314.86s]  I need to be doing way more than this. Nothing else up here. I don't want to get the bracers yet.
[2318.52s -> 2323.94s]  All right. Level eight, eighth sparrow. Maybe the other one will show up now.
[2330.18s -> 2349.59s]  Shit. Shit. I have to start taking something though. Area, it's going to be the candle.
[2351.29s -> 2358.33s]  I need spell binder and candle. They're both all right. I'll take the candle. To upgrade what I
[2358.33s -> 2383.03s]  have, I only realistically need curse and then the tiramisu duration is fine. I only need any
[2383.03s -> 2411.51s]  tiramisu and curse so I can take spell binder or cool down. I'm skipping. Those are the good shit.
[2411.51s -> 2418.02s]  I keep missing it. Spell binder is good. I know what it is. It really is. All right. That's good.
[2418.02s -> 2431.00s]  Come on. That's huge. Look at the area now. Look at the garlic area. That's just stupid. How big
[2431.00s -> 2441.62s]  that is. Where's the song of mana? How come the song of mana is not shooting anymore?
[2442.26s -> 2455.72s]  What's going on? Song of mana isn't firing. The mirror broke it. Wait. Why is it? Oh, there we go.
[2455.72s -> 2468.20s]  Finally. Okay. Why is it not shooting? What happened? The game looks fun. The game's amazing.
[2468.20s -> 2474.30s]  I think it's bugged. Hold on a second. What's, is something wrong? What's the matter? What's the
[2474.30s -> 2481.34s]  matter? Where are you? Hello, Agile. I think he wants something again. Do you need something
[2481.34s -> 2486.70s]  again? What can I do for you? Okay. Well, watch out. I don't. Move over there for a second.
[2487.34s -> 2493.62s]  Watch out. What do you want? Yeah. I, I, I guess there's something he wants. Do you want me to help
[2493.62s -> 2500.57s]  you? Yes. Okay. Let's go. Agile. You want me to show him? Um, I can't really. Let's see if I can
[2500.57s -> 2506.09s]  show. Agile. Can you see? All right. Agile. They want to see you. Come over here. Over there.
[2507.90s -> 2518.66s]  Auto cameo. Hold on. Let me see if I can. It's too dark in here. Hold on. I'll show him. Let me
[2518.66s -> 2530.06s]  turn the light on. Can you hear him? Can you hear his feet on my, uh, thing here? Okay. Can you see
[2530.06s -> 2546.26s]  him? I just turned the light on. Agile. What's that over there? Go, come over here. My hair looks
[2546.26s -> 2564.04s]  fucking crazy. Put this down. Hey, look. Agile. Agile, look. Agile. Agile. Look over there. Look
[2564.04s -> 2574.12s]  over there. What's that? You want to go? Okay. Let's go. Okay. Let's go. For real. No, he's not
[2574.12s -> 2588.74s]  wearing pants. All right. Give him a rest. All right. What are you looking for? What do you need?
[2589.78s -> 2650.82s]  All right. Give me one second. I'll be right back. Come on, you. Somebody said this song is driving
[2650.82s -> 2660.34s]  me insane. Why? It's not that good. Why? Okay. I'm going to have one earphone in because I don't
[2660.34s -> 2668.54s]  know if he's, uh, he might need, um, me to follow him again. I think he's just bored. I'm honest.
[2676.66s -> 2688.90s]  I think he's just bored. Okay. I'll finish this. This won't take that long. Another 12 minutes or
[2688.90s -> 2704.82s]  so. Yeah. What happened to the song of mana? Is it actually, is it happening? And I just don't see
[2704.82s -> 2719.77s]  it. I'm very confused. Is the animation bugged? Go back into the mirror. Hold on. I will in a
[2719.77s -> 2747.42s]  sec. Yeah. So what's the problem? I can hear it. I think it's happening. Um, I can't leave. Oh,
[2749.50s -> 2757.85s]  oh shit. That's not good. What if I just sit here? What if I just sit here? I can just win.
[2758.49s -> 2763.72s]  I don't have to do anything. Just sit here and win. This is a free win. Okay. All right.
[2766.14s -> 2776.12s]  Is it, oh, there we go. I don't know. I think, I think the animation is bugged. I think it's
[2776.12s -> 2795.77s]  actually still happening, but we just can't see it. That's my theory. Good. I can, uh, oh,
[2797.37s -> 2806.55s]  I need the tiramisu and I need the curse. There it is. Okay. So now we'll, if I evolve it,
[2806.55s -> 2823.75s]  maybe it'll fix it. All right. I need tiramisu. Hopefully it fixes it. Oh, I turned off the damage
[2823.75s -> 2842.78s]  numbers. Yeah. Oh my God. Die. How much health do you have? Holy shit. That was ridiculous.
[2845.90s -> 2849.34s]  Okay. Do I have enough? Yeah, I do. Let's do it. All right. Please fix it.
[2853.74s -> 2864.54s]  Might slow enemies. Does it fix? Um, I, yeah, I did. All right. It's good. It fixed. All right.
[2864.54s -> 2881.88s]  Thank God. That would have been bad. Yeah. It comes up from the middle. All right. Now
[2881.88s -> 2887.06s]  we're looking for a tiramisu and that's it. And that should get me pretty much what I want.
[2887.86s -> 2907.05s]  Just survive. We're at a Pizza Hut Bistro. What the hell is Pizza Hut Bistro? Let me go to six.
[2919.21s -> 2926.15s]  All right. Be careful. I don't want to die. The spammer is one. I don't know what happened.
[2926.79s -> 2964.98s]  Tiramisu. Oh, hell yeah. This is a guaranteed win. I'll open up another slot too. And there it is.
[2964.98s -> 2970.58s]  All right. I got leveled up. Yep. Let's open that chest up and let's see the double,
[2971.88s -> 2981.02s]  the double revolver upgrade. It's actually pretty ridiculous. I think it's just a huge circle. Union
[2981.02s -> 2997.51s]  of Ferrara de la Tefilo and Eight of the Sparrow. Check this out. I need duration. Oh well. Okay.
[2997.51s -> 3004.04s]  Now I can go down. I can collect all this shit down here and I can, can I, what should I get?
[3004.04s -> 3014.65s]  What's the, what's the candle upgrade for the clover? Which one? Cross is, uh, one of them,
[3014.65s -> 3024.39s]  right? I actually don't really want to upgrade the skull. Axe and cross. Which one's better for this
[3024.39s -> 3039.88s]  build? Probably the cross, right? Oh no. Axe is better because Axe is the spin. Yeah. I'll get the
[3039.88s -> 3072.55s]  Axe if it shows up and it's okay. You know, I got a craving for bugles too. I just want a big bag of
[3072.55s -> 3094.79s]  bugles. I'm going to eat the whole bag. Tons of area. Yeah. So much area effect. I could probably
[3094.79s -> 3099.42s]  just stand still to be honest. Yeah, I can. I'm going to stand still for one minute. I'm going to
[3099.42s -> 3104.63s]  collect and I'm going to get all the items. Try the spicy fried chicken bugles. I don't know why
[3104.63s -> 3108.86s]  those sound terrible, but I feel like I probably would like them. Those sound gross, but good at
[3108.86s -> 3150.52s]  the same time. I can't really, I gotta move. All right. Come on. Stop. I'll take it. Ooh,
[3151.48s -> 3162.63s]  that's a tiramisu. That means I get to revive if I die two times. There's so much food left over
[3162.63s -> 3170.87s]  from the tierless stream. Uh, I'm not going to eat Mike and Ike's snowcaps and butterbread for
[3170.87s -> 3180.07s]  dinner. That's not what I'm going to eat. Well, it's over. Uh, I'm probably going to have to just do
[3181.19s -> 3193.64s]  santa water or whip. Whip is probably better for here. How much is left? Uh, the two diet sodas
[3193.64s -> 3200.54s]  are still in the fridge. I refuse to drink them. Upgrade the whip. I can no longer upgrade anything.
[3201.62s -> 3209.86s]  I'll take the water. Why? It's just area. Um, what were we just saying? Yeah. Okay. I've opened up
[3209.86s -> 3214.50s]  the fridge and gone. Okay. Wait, there's a soda in here. I drank all the other ones besides the diet
[3214.50s -> 3223.56s]  Mountain Dew and the diet Coke. Every, all the other ones are gone, but man, I just think of
[3223.56s -> 3228.20s]  drinking the diet soda and I go, that's, that's grossing me out. I do not want it.
[3229.24s -> 3235.00s]  And I get kind of annoyed that it's in there. I get sad and irritated that it's in the fridge
[3235.00s -> 3257.42s]  because I can't drink it. I don't know what to do with it. Diet soda sucks. It really does.
[3257.42s -> 3263.75s]  It's just awful. I know some people have that specific palette that really loves diet soda.
[3265.46s -> 3281.88s]  I'm not, I am not one of the metal. Pour it in your engine. I'm not going to do that.
[3282.44s -> 3292.55s]  That's a very bad idea. Um, I'm going to have to upgrade the skull-o-matic.
[3292.55s -> 3299.26s]  This is going to be a disaster. Five minutes. Okay. I'm just not going to level up for five
[3299.26s -> 3315.70s]  minutes. Regular soda is too sugary. You know, this is, you can't really do this with soda,
[3316.42s -> 3324.17s]  but I will buy juice from the grocery store. And instead of drinking it just straight up,
[3324.81s -> 3330.66s]  I dilute most of the juices that I drink besides orange juice, which I feel like orange juice and
[3330.66s -> 3337.26s]  apple juice. You can't do this with, but all the junk, the cranberry juice cocktail that tastes
[3337.26s -> 3345.02s]  like you're drinking a syrup. Um, I dilute it by 50% lemonade store lemonade, lemonade you buy in
[3345.02s -> 3355.78s]  the store. I dilute by about 40 to 60%. So if I buy a, I don't know what two liter of lemonade,
[3356.58s -> 3369.51s]  that'll last for fucking two weeks at least. It lasts a very long time. I dilute a lot of my drinks.
[3369.51s -> 3381.24s]  I guess I could go pick up those items. Yeah. I'll just do it. What is that? Um, what is that?
[3381.24s -> 3385.43s]  What's going on? That's kind of weird. I don't know what that is. I'm afraid to go over there.
[3386.15s -> 3407.21s]  I'll even do that with Powerade or Gatorade too. If I get a large Powerade from something like
[3407.21s -> 3413.93s]  McDonald's or something, I always drink half of it and then put water in it, drink half of it,
[3413.93s -> 3421.21s]  put water in it, drink half of it, put water in it until it's, Oh, Oh, Oh my God. I'm dead.
[3422.01s -> 3425.21s]  I got to, I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. Just relax. It's supposed to be a
[3425.21s -> 3439.27s]  wind down. I'm fine. Yeah. It gets to a point where it turns into like homeopathy. I just
[3439.27s -> 3444.95s]  diluted so much. Don't die. Please. I don't have enough dip. I'm fucking dead. Oh my God. What
[3444.95s -> 3450.92s]  happened? No, I'm fine. I got revived. Just run. What is going on down here with this fucking weird
[3450.92s -> 3457.74s]  cold shit? Guys, I'm going to die. I'm going to lose right now. I've never seen this before.
[3457.74s -> 3463.22s]  I'm dead. I lost games over. I don't know what's happening. I can't even do anything. I couldn't
[3463.22s -> 3468.34s]  move. You picked garlic. What just happened right there? What is it? What's going on? I
[3468.34s -> 3474.02s]  have my screen. Like my CRTV fucking is broken. My CRT TV is broken. What is that? What the fuck
[3474.02s -> 3487.24s]  is going on down here? What is this? What is this? I was half the screen. I can't go over there.
[3487.24s -> 3499.91s]  What the fuck was that? What the, who gives a shit? What were we even just talking about? I'm pissed.
[3499.91s -> 3504.86s]  What were we just talking about? Cause I'm never bringing it up ever again. I dilute all my drinks
[3504.86s -> 3512.42s]  like a fucking weirdo. All right. Good to know. Okay. I go up to this. I go to the sink and I
[3512.42s -> 3518.66s]  fill it with water and I make the Powerade last an extra, an extra six hours. Dude,
[3518.66s -> 3533.86s]  you're a fucking weirdo. Stop. Why can I not do this? Can I buy it? Oh, all right. What the fuck?
[3533.86s -> 3540.57s]  I'm so pissed. Oh, I want to see what that does. Gains 1% area every level. I'm, I'm curious what
[3540.57s -> 3554.74s]  it does. So I want area. I can't believe I just died. I wasn't killing anything fast enough.
[3554.74s -> 3580.18s]  I'm fucking mad right now. All right. Let's check it out. Moon glow. What's moon glow? Should I try
[3580.18s -> 3590.33s]  it? All right. What's this new weapon? Whoa. That's kind of, does it go in the area that you aim in?
[3590.33s -> 3605.43s]  Oh, that's kind of weird. That's pretty weird. Wind down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm up.
[3605.43s -> 3615.05s]  Said I was only going to do one round. You're right. What is, look at all this. Um, there's
[3615.05s -> 3630.33s]  items everywhere. He's cranky. I was, I was shocked that I lost. I was doing so well. And then I was
[3630.33s -> 3637.48s]  talking about diluting my Powerades. I feel like the next thing I was going to say was, oh, I also
[3637.48s -> 3642.60s]  reuse my band-aids too, because they're fine. I take them off the cut and I put them in a box.
[3642.60s -> 3653.43s]  And then when I have another cut, I put like, what am I talking about? What the hell am I talking
[3653.43s -> 3670.86s]  about? He's frugal, frugal. This character is pretty cool. No, no. Why would you don't do that
[3670.86s -> 3678.15s]  ever? Why would you ever do something like that? Talk to the guy in the middle. Oh, I thought that
[3678.15s -> 3699.88s]  was an enemy. Golden egg. Summons the merchant in all stages for 10,000 bucks. Um, that's okay. So
[3699.88s -> 3706.70s]  I can buy stuff. It's another money sink. Well, that makes sense considering if you have more
[3706.70s -> 3711.50s]  than a few hundred hours in this game, you can pretty much buy every single upgrade in the power
[3711.50s -> 3722.22s]  up list. So I'm imagining this is the way to make it so people have to drop 20 grand. That's fine.
[3722.22s -> 3729.59s]  All right. That's fine. Yeah. Yeah. I'll say what only I was only going to one more than a few
[3729.59s -> 3737.18s]  hundred was a few grand. It was like five, 10 grand. All right. What was today? Well, let's,
[3737.18s -> 3741.83s]  let's talk about what we're doing this week. Uh, I have access to the multi versus game,
[3741.83s -> 3748.92s]  so I want to play that. Uh, let's get a schedule here. All right. Here you go. Here's, here's,
[3748.92s -> 3758.84s]  here's a schedule for you. Wednesday. We're going to do multi versus and, um, probably the house
[3758.84s -> 3767.22s]  flipper at DLC. And then this weekend, probably Friday and Saturday or Saturday, Sunday, we'll do
[3768.42s -> 3775.22s]  something else, but we'll do Wednesday. We're going to do multi versus and, you know, fucking, uh,
[3775.86s -> 3791.69s]  fucking heads DLC. Sounds good. You should play Soma. When's the Elden Ring PVP thing? You know,
[3791.69s -> 3800.07s]  it's, I gotta talk to Ludwig because I, when we did that last time, it was just, it felt like so
[3800.07s -> 3805.75s]  difficult to actually get that to work. Um, and then it kind of fell out, fell out and fell out
[3805.75s -> 3813.06s]  and fell out. So I don't know if we're going to do it. I'll, I'll ping Ludwig and say, uh, maybe
[3813.06s -> 3820.41s]  we'll do something else. Go get a Snickers. You're not you when you're hungry. I'm, I'm fine. I'm
[3820.41s -> 3827.74s]  having a good time. I've been having a good time this whole time. You should try people's playground.
[3827.74s -> 3833.96s]  I'll check it out. When are you going to do the green screen stream? I will announce the date for
[3833.96s -> 3843.26s]  the green screen stream when, uh, we get closer to it, but over the next night or two, you will
[3843.26s -> 3849.26s]  see a green screen discussion for you to please go to that channel, talk about what you want me to do
[3850.14s -> 3854.30s]  actions you want to see. Cause this is the last time I'm ever going in front of the green screen
[3854.38s -> 3860.54s]  ever. This is it. This is the third and final four to six hour green screen
[3861.18s -> 3869.21s]  stream. And then after that, they will be a green screen movie night. I know the whole copyright
[3869.21s -> 3876.01s]  thing. I don't give a shit anymore, if I'm honest. Um, I feel like I've had that bottled for two and
[3876.01s -> 3882.84s]  a half years or so, two years, and I'm just going to do it. So we're going to have some rules in
[3882.84s -> 3886.54s]  place to make it so it's not, if you do it, if you're going to, this is all stuff for like a
[3886.54s -> 3892.07s]  couple of weeks from now, but there's going to be rules for copyright. There's going to be rules for
[3893.51s -> 3897.35s]  length of the videos and we'll, we'll get there, but let's just, let me get in front of the screen
[3897.35s -> 3907.93s]  first. Why is this going to be the last one? It just is. This is the last green screen stream.
[3907.93s -> 3921.38s]  I feel like it kind of has to be. Can I find the stream schedule anywhere? Um, I don't really have
[3921.38s -> 3927.48s]  one. Uh, if you, if you want to know my schedule, well, this is not even accurate either. Exclamation
[3927.48s -> 3932.76s]  point sus, nothing to do with Among Us. I, that was my thing before Among Us came out seven years
[3932.76s -> 3938.04s]  ago. Okay. Uh, exclamation point sus. It'll tell you the general idea of when the next stream will
[3938.04s -> 3945.35s]  be usually a date. Sometimes I do it another day, but sometimes I do it early. Whatever.
[3946.73s -> 3950.57s]  Whatever. It's okay. It's okay. I might do a stream earlier than sus or later than sus,
[3950.57s -> 3956.58s]  but that's a general idea. And I usually stream about two or three times a week, at least once.
[3960.10s -> 3965.22s]  He's never been earlier in his whole life. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. I was early,
[3965.86s -> 3970.42s]  literally two days ago, three days ago. That stream was not supposed to happen on that day.
[3970.42s -> 3982.58s]  It was supposed to be a day later. It was literally three days ago. Dermot, when you retire,
[3982.58s -> 3993.83s]  can I have your life force? Um, why do you think it should just be you? No, I want you to fucking,
[3993.83s -> 4003.67s]  I want, I want you to fucking sprinkle my fucking ashes. I want you to fucking sprinkle my ashes
[4003.67s -> 4007.91s]  in a place where I want to grow into a big fucking tree with a lot of shade. And I want
[4007.91s -> 4012.79s]  people to be able to come in and enjoy the shade as a, I want to be a big oak tree.
[4013.43s -> 4025.40s]  Retirement doesn't, well, that is retirement does not mean you're going to die. Yeah. Retirement
[4025.40s -> 4037.19s]  means you're going to get cremated. I probably shouldn't retire then. Turn them into an urn tree.
[4041.08s -> 4044.28s]  All right. I'll see you later. I'll see you on Wednesday. Thanks for watching as always.
[4044.92s -> 4052.36s]  We'll do multiverses and the pets DLC on Wednesday. See you in a day or two and then we'll see you
[4052.36s -> 4068.06s]  this weekend as well. Can I keep some of your ashes for jewelry? No, you're, this is what's
[4068.06s -> 4073.10s]  going to happen to me. I'm going to, my urn is going to be filled with fertilizer and like fucking
[4073.10s -> 4078.90s]  vitamins for an oak tree. You're going to put an oak tree seed in the urn and you're going to bury
[4078.90s -> 4095.21s]  the urn. That's what happens to me. Yeah. I want vitamins. I want oak tree vitamins. I want you
[4095.21s -> 4100.97s]  to sprinkle in a little bit of stuff that I like, you know, maybe some green tea powder,
[4101.53s -> 4113.05s]  stuff that I like too. A tree will be dead in a week. I want some orange juice. If the
[4113.05s -> 4130.82s]  thing's going to sprout up and just be dead. Oh God, you should be an apple tree. No, I don't
[4130.82s -> 4140.07s]  want people to eat me. That's kind of weird to me. I just want to be a huge towering oak tree.
[4140.79s -> 4144.63s]  And the only thing you could ever do is if somebody ever came up with, oh, I can,
[4144.63s -> 4150.55s]  we can hear, we can hear the oak tree, some sound of phone or whatever. I just,
[4150.55s -> 4160.78s]  all I want is to be able to hear like, that's all I want you to be able to do. Nothing else.
[4160.78s -> 4167.00s]  I want you to be able to hear that. It's going to be a short tree. No, it's going to be the
[4167.00s -> 4180.79s]  biggest oak tree in the forest and the whole forest. Yeah. You're going to put your ear up
[4180.79s -> 4194.58s]  to the bark and you're just going to hear like Nutella. Yeah. You put your ear up and you just
[4194.58s -> 4218.57s]  hear Nutella. What do you mean ow? Stop that. I didn't do, I, I look at it, but that's not even
[4218.57s -> 4229.27s]  that loud. They're going to chop you down for a housing development. No, they will not. I will
[4229.35s -> 4239.05s]  stop them. They will get to my tree and the, it's going to darken and a storm is going to
[4239.85s -> 4244.97s]  start rolling in and then lightning strikes, strikes, strike all around the tree, all around
[4244.97s -> 4250.54s]  me. And they're going to go, we got to get out of here. Oh my God, this is crazy. A storm.
[4251.93s -> 4255.85s]  And then right when they leave, the sun is going to start shining and a sun shower is going to
[4255.85s -> 4261.13s]  happen. And every time they come over there, every time they try to take my tree down with
[4261.13s -> 4265.69s]  a bulldozer, the storm rolls in again. Lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning,
[4265.69s -> 4280.12s]  lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning. They'll never take me down. This sounds like a child made
[4280.12s -> 4288.94s]  this story up. Oh, let's just get rid of our imaginations. Okay. Bye. I'll see you Wednesday.
[4288.94s -> 4295.21s]  Good night. Goodbye. Take care of yourselves. Call your mother. You know, good night. Goodbye.
[4295.21s -> 4301.83s]  Take care of yourselves. Call your mother. See you Wednesday. Goodbye.
