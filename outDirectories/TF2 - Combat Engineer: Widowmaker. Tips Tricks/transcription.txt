[1.78s -> 9.28s]  Hey, what's happening guys? Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, but you already knew that so let's get right into this here.
[9.28s -> 15.28s]  Playing as the engineer, the new Widowmaker engineer. First time I really got to sit down with it and really try it out.
[15.28s -> 20.28s]  Gonna give you guys my real impressions rather than my live crazy psycho impressions.
[20.28s -> 23.28s]  Playing on defense on upward right now.
[23.28s -> 29.34s]  And we are using the Widowmaker obviously, the pistol and the gunslinger.
[29.34s -> 32.84s]  So real quickly I want to break down what happened right there in the beginning.
[32.84s -> 37.08s]  If you noticed, when I came out of the spawn I had 200 metal.
[37.08s -> 41.08s]  I dropped a mini sentry on the ground and just started firing away.
[41.08s -> 45.58s]  I killed three people and got back to 200 metal.
[45.58s -> 54.08s]  What that means is I can drop another sentry down if that one gets destroyed or I can start to build a dispenser and not have to worry about running around to find ammo.
[54.08s -> 62.58s]  What we used to do as engineers is we'd have the frontier justice or the normal shotgun and we would be waiting for an opportunity to shoot somebody.
[62.58s -> 66.58s]  With the frontier justice you are waiting for an opportunity to shoot.
[66.58s -> 73.58s]  Rather than just shooting and firing away with a regular shotgun or with this gun, the frontier justice was kind of a wait and see attitude.
[73.58s -> 76.58s]  You wanted to get those crits, you wanted to really make sure they really counted.
[76.58s -> 83.08s]  With the Widowmaker you are not as concerned about holding on to your shots or making your shots count.
[83.08s -> 90.58s]  Because honestly, if you miss, if I miss this gun four times and then I land one body shot, I'm fine.
[90.58s -> 96.32s]  That one on one right there that you just saw with that sniper I missed six times.
[96.32s -> 99.50s]  I missed him six times and still killed him.
[99.50s -> 104.50s]  So throw away the notion that you have to be a really good shot to use this gun.
[104.50s -> 107.12s]  You really don't have to.
[107.12s -> 110.62s]  So now let me just give you guys a few combat engineer tips.
[110.62s -> 115.12s]  Some things that will help your team out, especially if there's more than one engineer on the team.
[115.12s -> 116.62s]  See what I'm doing right here.
[116.62s -> 121.12s]  I'm giving this guy my dispenser because I technically don't really need it for anything.
[121.12s -> 123.93s]  I don't have to have a constant supply of metal.
[123.93s -> 126.43s]  I don't need to run back to my dispenser all the time.
[126.43s -> 129.93s]  Because of course I throw away my sentries, I drop them in random places.
[129.93s -> 137.93s]  As a combat engi your dispenser is pretty much designed to be a healbot for the rest of the team and to give the other engineers metal.
[137.93s -> 142.93s]  I can't really think of another reason why you'd ever need a dispenser for any reason if you're doing the mini sentry.
[142.93s -> 145.93s]  Because the Widowmaker is just a generator of metal.
[145.93s -> 149.93s]  So you can technically just run around in circles and get metal by killing people.
[149.93s -> 157.42s]  Also another really really important combat engi tip I want to give you guys is don't worry about your mini sentry.
[157.42s -> 159.42s]  Watch how fast I put it down right here.
[159.42s -> 162.42s]  I'm just getting it in the line of sight of the other players.
[162.42s -> 167.42s]  You don't have to really fiddle with it and oh should I put it here or maybe I should put it over here.
[167.42s -> 169.42s]  Don't worry about it, just drop it somewhere.
[169.42s -> 170.42s]  I'll do it again, ready?
[170.42s -> 171.42s]  Boing, right here.
[171.42s -> 173.79s]  I know it's going to get destroyed.
[173.79s -> 176.79s]  Your mini sentry is always going to get destroyed.
[176.79s -> 179.79s]  So don't try and hide it somewhere, don't try and fiddle with it.
[179.79s -> 184.79s]  The only reason why I would say to hide it somewhere is if you're on a map that's pretty small.
[184.79s -> 188.79s]  Like a King of the Hill map like Harvest or something where you can sneak it in a window or something.
[188.79s -> 191.79s]  But on a fairly large map like this, just get it out there.
[191.79s -> 194.79s]  It's a huge map, people will always be running around it.
[194.79s -> 195.79s]  Just get it down.
[195.79s -> 203.22s]  The third and final combat engineer tip I'm going to give you guys in this video is about spies and dealing with your sentry being sapped.
[203.22s -> 208.22s]  Up in the top left corner my sentry has been sapped and I don't care.
[208.22s -> 211.64s]  Never care about that.
[211.64s -> 216.64s]  If your sentry is getting sapped, your mini sentry by a spy, just let him have his glory.
[216.64s -> 222.64s]  Let him have his fun because it's not worth going over to whack it two times to take the sapper off.
[222.64s -> 226.64s]  When, like I said before, it's just going to get destroyed anyways.
[226.64s -> 232.82s]  You can give that spy a little tip to the hat and say, alright, you did it, you got my mini sentry, whatever.
[232.82s -> 233.82s]  It doesn't matter.
[233.82s -> 240.82s]  Don't get yourself into trouble because a lot of times when somebody does that, when a spy does that, he's trying to lure you over to the sentry,
[240.82s -> 245.82s]  try to pull you away from the front lines, try to get you in a position where they can get a backstab on you
[245.82s -> 249.82s]  or where they can get a revolver kill on you because they're knowing that you're a combat engineer.
[249.82s -> 251.82s]  I have seen it so many times when I play spy.
[251.82s -> 255.82s]  I'll put a sapper on a mini sentry and I'll just see in the distance,
[255.82s -> 258.82s]  only my sentry I've got to protect it.
[260.82s -> 262.82s]  And they'll just burp and come back over and puke.
[262.82s -> 264.82s]  And you don't have to do that.
[264.82s -> 266.82s]  There really is no reason to do that.
[266.82s -> 267.82s]  It's a mini sentry.
[267.82s -> 269.82s]  Just let it die and say, you did it, spy.
[269.82s -> 270.82s]  Thanks.
[270.82s -> 275.38s]  So right now I'm just browsing the area trying to get some damage on people.
[275.38s -> 279.38s]  I don't want to shoot with the Widowmaker from that far away because the Widowmaker takes 30 metal to shoot.
[279.38s -> 285.38s]  And if you hit someone from that far away, you're only going to get like 3 or 4 metal back
[285.38s -> 289.68s]  and it's totally 100% not worth it getting this dispenser up to level 3
[289.68s -> 293.68s]  because it's been level 1 for the whole entire match.
[293.68s -> 295.68s]  And I apologize to my team for that.
[295.68s -> 298.68s]  Get it right up next to this building so spam can't take it out.
[298.68s -> 301.68s]  The only concern I have is in the right side of that tunnel.
[301.68s -> 303.68s]  Somebody could just come over there and kill it.
[303.68s -> 306.68s]  Not that worried about it though because we have a full level 3 sentry
[306.68s -> 309.68s]  and a level 3 dispenser right in the room next to me.
[309.68s -> 311.68s]  So not that concerned about it.
[311.68s -> 314.86s]  As I was dead, they ended up killing the sentry in this building.
[314.86s -> 318.86s]  Good thing this dispenser is still here because this engineer is probably going to need it.
[318.86s -> 321.86s]  Like I said before, it's a perfect spot for him to get it.
[321.86s -> 324.86s]  And he can take as much as he wants because I don't need it.
[324.86s -> 327.86s]  Dropping a mini sentry over here trying to get these guys off the cart.
[327.86s -> 330.86s]  They get on the cart, the soldiers on the cart, and the scout.
[330.86s -> 332.86s]  I follow the scout into this room. This is great.
[332.86s -> 334.86s]  And I run out of metal.
[334.86s -> 338.86s]  So I pull out the whippin' gunslinger and I just punch him in his face.
[338.86s -> 341.86s]  He was pulling out the fish I believe so that could have been bad.
[341.86s -> 344.86s]  Medic is trying to get on the cart. I get him, dominate him.
[344.86s -> 346.86s]  I don't even know how many people I was dominating.
[346.86s -> 349.10s]  I was dominating at least 2 or 3 people.
[349.10s -> 351.10s]  This is where it becomes crunch time as you all know.
[351.10s -> 354.10s]  Less than 2 minutes on the clock. We all have been in this situation before.
[354.10s -> 356.10s]  Cart is very close to being capped.
[356.10s -> 358.10s]  Less than a few minutes to go.
[358.10s -> 361.10s]  Everybody's nervous. Everyone's nerve wracking right now.
[361.10s -> 366.10s]  Because you don't want them to cap it because the clock just goes right back up and we start all over again.
[366.10s -> 370.40s]  At this point in the match when it becomes this hectic and when it becomes this close,
[370.40s -> 374.40s]  definitely help out your other engineer that has a big sentry.
[374.40s -> 378.40s]  It's so important that this gets up to at least level 2.
[378.40s -> 381.40s]  Because if they did cap it, if they do cap it,
[381.40s -> 385.40s]  they will not be able to just steamroll right through everyone.
[385.40s -> 389.40s]  There will be a big sentry here to suppress them and maybe we can keep it rolling.
[389.40s -> 393.70s]  But I don't even want it to get that far. We want to just end it right now.
[393.70s -> 397.70s]  Get back here behind the enemy lines and this is where it gets pretty interesting.
[397.70s -> 400.70s]  Kill this sniper. I was pretty concerned about getting shot in the face.
[400.70s -> 402.70s]  Get him with a nice couple of shots.
[402.70s -> 404.70s]  Another sniper, a huntsman sniper goes down too.
[404.70s -> 407.70s]  Then me and this spy go over here and look what's in this room.
[407.70s -> 410.70s]  They had a teleporter here the entire time.
[410.70s -> 413.70s]  I'm not going to shoot it because I don't want to steal the spy's kill.
[413.70s -> 416.70s]  Because I don't like when that happens to me so I don't like doing it to other people.
[416.70s -> 418.70s]  Kill that scout with a few shots right in his face.
[418.70s -> 420.70s]  This is coming down to the end here.
[420.70s -> 421.70s]  Less than a minute left.
[421.70s -> 425.70s]  Putting a mini sentry in this room to surprise the crap out of people.
[425.70s -> 429.88s]  My dispenser right now is being sapped and there's obviously nothing I can do about it
[429.88s -> 432.88s]  because I just got shot in my face with the huntsman.
[432.88s -> 436.12s]  Less than 20 seconds left in the game and look at the cart.
[436.12s -> 441.12s]  I was just screaming in my head, no please.
[441.12s -> 443.12s]  So I just get on the cart, do anything I can.
[443.12s -> 446.12s]  I don't care if I die. I'm just going on here to stop this cap.
[446.12s -> 447.12s]  And this is the end right here.
[447.12s -> 450.12s]  I pushed the scout off, he accidentally falls.
[450.12s -> 453.12s]  And that's going to be the end of the gameplay guys.
[453.12s -> 455.30s]  I never have said this before but I want to say it.
[455.30s -> 456.30s]  I've never shouted this out.
[456.30s -> 458.30s]  I have a Facebook now.
[458.30s -> 461.30s]  An official German 985 Facebook.
[461.30s -> 462.30s]  No one really knows about it.
[462.30s -> 465.30s]  There's only like 30 or 40 people that even know.
[465.30s -> 466.30s]  So go check it out.
[466.30s -> 468.30s]  The link will be in the description for my Facebook.
[468.30s -> 470.30s]  I will see you all next time.
[470.30s -> 472.30s]  And take care everybody.
