[1.91s -> 12.52s]  Okay, so I think what I want to do is I want to play the game. I want to play the game
[13.56s -> 26.92s]  that I was gonna play instead of this. I want to play Wizorb, another requested game. It looks
[26.92s -> 33.03s]  like a lot of fun, and it's a good, I think, little short little game just to play in the meantime.
[34.14s -> 46.54s]  It's, we made a reference to it during Nancy Drew. Just chill out for a little bit. I'm gonna give
[46.54s -> 60.07s]  it a try. Let's open it right now. If I can get, where's my library? Diablo II. I do want to
[60.07s -> 65.75s]  actually play Diablo II. I want to play Diablo II on hardcore and keep that character alive as
[65.75s -> 73.59s]  best as I can. And if the character, you know, that's it, hardcore. Try to keep that character
[73.59s -> 82.04s]  going. Maybe jump in random servers with people. But I don't want to boost, I know, I don't want
[82.04s -> 90.12s]  to do a thing where you join the cowl level 10 times or you join the tombs 10 times. You do
[90.12s -> 97.75s]  Tristram 30 times in a row and you level up 40 times. I want to do it legit. But anyways,
[97.75s -> 103.64s]  I'm gonna play Wizorb. It was in the recommended channel and it actually looks cute. It looks very
[103.64s -> 111.08s]  cute. It looks very fun. We'll see. I'm gonna give it a chance. It looks pretty good. And good thing
[111.08s -> 119.38s]  I turned that volume off because holy shit, I would have just hurt a lot of people. You can
[119.38s -> 128.15s]  probably hear it through. It looks like Game Boy. Okay, hold on. Look what was said about you. Hold
[128.15s -> 138.50s]  on. I'll look at it in a sec. No vibration. Full screen on. Paddle speed. What am I supposed to do?
[138.50s -> 153.72s]  40%? This is still loud. 20%? Yeah, it's still loud as fuck. Hold on, I'll look at it. Beat Dark
[153.72s -> 160.81s]  Souls real quick. Um, I, no, I don't think so. Let me get this captured. Can this be captured?
[160.81s -> 172.90s]  Let's hope so. Let's hope so. What was it? Let me see that clip to people spamming this clip.
[172.90s -> 191.16s]  What was said about me? What did Joel say? Let's see. All right. What does he say? He's like
[191.16s -> 199.94s]  stretching something over my face. Did he trace my, what did he trace over my face? What the hell is
[199.94s -> 219.18s]  this? That's not even that funny. That's not even funny. Oh, this is kind of funny. Hold on,
[219.18s -> 224.47s]  hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Let me just get this captured first. He thinks it's his real face. He
[224.47s -> 232.65s]  thinks that, no, I don't. I mean, it could have been. Wizard Orb. You guys are gonna like this.
[232.65s -> 237.37s]  Look at how cute this is. Look at how fucking cute this is. All right. I gotta show this shit
[238.01s -> 244.20s]  because everybody wants to fucking laugh out loud.
[245.08s -> 285.08s]  Everyone's just laughing out loud about it. Okay. I gotta also do this. It's being stretched.
[285.08s -> 292.20s]  It's being stretched. It's being stretched. All right. I'll see you soon. Bye. Thank you.
[294.60s -> 298.12s]  All right. I'm going to, the image is being stretched. I got to change this.
[299.08s -> 304.84s]  Uh, let's do, it's called Wizard Orb, right? I think I got a prediction here. I think you guys
[304.84s -> 318.71s]  are gonna really like this game. This is like a breakout. Breakout. I think I'm gonna like this
[318.71s -> 328.23s]  game. Time to get addicted. Let's go. Uh, new quest. Difficulty. What do we do? Easy. No. Ah,
[328.23s -> 332.79s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I wanted to do normal. Oh no. Back it up. Back it up. No, no, no, no, no,
[332.79s -> 344.44s]  no, no. I got to turn it, but I just found out it's too loud. Let's turn that down.
[348.98s -> 359.42s]  Shit, it's fucking loud. All right. New quest. Yes, I'm sure. Is hard. Let's just, let's just do
[359.42s -> 376.62s]  normal. How hard is hard? I wonder how hard hard is. Hmm. All right. I'll try. How do you control it?
[378.97s -> 391.72s]  Oh shit. I have to hit the bears? Wait, I can shoot? Oh, I think I can only do that. So wait,
[391.72s -> 394.20s]  I can only do that a little. I think I just wasted all of it. It's all gone.
[395.08s -> 408.26s]  Yeah, that's all gone. God damn it. It's breakout. Yeah. This is sick. Thank you for helping us.
[408.26s -> 412.26s]  The citizens of Taro are the only ones to have escaped the curse cast by demons.
[413.06s -> 418.81s]  However, monsters came from Gerudo castle and attacked our town. Please save the kingdom of
[418.81s -> 426.73s]  Gerudo. All right. Go ahead. I can wait. I can walk around too. The mayor cares more for his
[426.73s -> 432.81s]  citizens than for himself. I'd rebuild his house if I had the funds. Donate 999 GP.
[434.52s -> 441.27s]  I don't have that. Once united, the four sacred children of Gerudo have the power of summoning
[441.27s -> 447.51s]  the forces of nature. They could help us if we could find them. All right. This is fucking
[447.51s -> 456.23s]  pogchamp if I've ever seen one. Does he have to like rebuild shit? All right. Let's go. I can't
[456.23s -> 460.55s]  do any business without a nice shop. What shall I do? Donate 700. I don't have that. All right.
[461.51s -> 469.42s]  This is all upgradable. It's already got me. It's already got me. All right. Those little cows are
[469.42s -> 476.57s]  so cute. It would be a shame if they got lost and hurt themselves. Yeah. All right. Again, 100 GP.
[477.37s -> 480.90s]  Please accept this reward as a token of my gratitude. You got a key.
[481.62s -> 489.13s]  Well, you're welcome. All right. What about you? What does a poor peasant like me do without his
[489.13s -> 498.92s]  farm and his land? Donate 350. All right. I need to get GP. Time to unbox. Without a watermill,
[498.92s -> 505.61s]  we can't produce flour. People are starving. Look, I can only do one thing at a time here. All
[505.61s -> 525.91s]  right. How do I leave? Do I just leave? Oh, shit. All right. Clover village. Oh, all right. Let's
[525.91s -> 539.86s]  do it. This is it. This is where we get money. I don't have any fire left. All right. Hold on.
[539.86s -> 543.46s]  What am I doing? Okay. My brain is freaking out. It's just mouse. It's just the mouse.
[544.42s -> 552.44s]  I'm doing like WASD. You can move it with WASD. Okay. I got fireballs now. Can I break them?
[552.60s -> 556.52s]  You can break them with the fireball. Holy shit. All right. This is overwhelming me. This is fun.
[557.48s -> 565.70s]  I actually like this. Yep. All right. It's on hard. Fuck. It's on hard. All right. All right.
[565.70s -> 568.82s]  It's fun. It's fun. It's fun. Continue. Continue. I only have three continues. What?
[570.30s -> 577.85s]  Not rich is rich. Oh, okay. Hold on. Hold on. Re, um, reach. Do I only have three continues ever?
[578.49s -> 588.65s]  All right. Don't mess with me. Oh my God. Why am I so, I'm like, I'm so overexcited and shit.
[588.65s -> 611.42s]  Like, what's wrong with me? I'm freaking out. All right. I got the bad guy. Am I getting, am I
[611.42s -> 627.85s]  getting GP? Holy fuck. That was close. I can break the last two over here. It's got, the ball moves
[627.85s -> 646.63s]  really fast. Got it. All right. Oops. So red rupees 10 GP. Cool. That's level one. All right.
[647.19s -> 650.71s]  I got to get it up in the top. So it bounces on top of everything. Here we go. Ready?
[651.67s -> 660.02s]  First try. Get it. Thank you. And I can't shoot these. So I have to, it has to go up there.
[660.90s -> 667.96s]  What is K? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What did I just do? All right. Well, K does what? Oh, it's wind.
[668.84s -> 678.89s]  It's the right amount. I'm not sure what it does. I just fucking blew that. All right. Let's go.
[682.39s -> 688.46s]  Alter? So you can blow it the other direction?
[690.82s -> 703.22s]  Huh. I see. All right. Well, that was easy. Push me towards the paddle. Is that what's going on?
[703.86s -> 715.13s]  Remember this shit's on heart. Let's go. Where should I go? I'm going to try to go. I'm going to
[715.13s -> 727.34s]  try to get stuck in the top right. Fucked it up. Sorry. Open the crates. Stay on that right. Stay
[727.34s -> 738.31s]  on the left side. Yeah. When did this game come out? Why did I not know this game existed?
[739.11s -> 765.99s]  Came out in 1980? No, it's not. It's got great sounds too. I have enough to do with the lumber
[765.99s -> 787.58s]  mill, whatever it is. Maybe I'll do that. Get on there. The farmer? Yeah. Yeah. We'll, we'll pick
[787.58s -> 798.73s]  one. 2011 was almost 10 years ago. I know it's ridiculous. I'm making a lot of money though.
[799.37s -> 805.00s]  Jeremy, this is a fun mini game. Can you please go back to solving the main mystery in Nancy Drew?
[806.31s -> 816.58s]  Nah. Nah, I'm good for now. I only have two more continues though. I'm kind of concerned about
[816.58s -> 826.60s]  that. Did I blow the whole thing? Do I only get three continues the whole game? I wasted all my
[826.60s -> 837.48s]  ammo. Can I sneak it up the side? Yep. Oh, this is, this is nice. I like this. This is relaxing to me.
[838.36s -> 853.43s]  Shit. I missed the coin. Whoa. What just happened? I was like, it's like pinball.
[855.05s -> 862.74s]  All right. Pop it. Pop it off. Do I have any time or is it just whenever I fall?
[870.66s -> 874.34s]  Oh, this is cool. There's like 20 plus hours of Nancy Drew on YouTube now.
[875.06s -> 885.24s]  What do you mean? 20 plus hours? You're talking about from this channel? I mean, yeah.
[885.96s -> 895.19s]  We played three of the games and beaten two of them. I have to be careful though because
[896.46s -> 903.03s]  if you, there are some Twitch metrics that you can look at and you can see, you can analyze your
[903.03s -> 909.03s]  stream. You can analyze data and all this shit, right? Once you, I don't want to cross the
[909.03s -> 921.37s]  threshold where Nancy Drew is in like the top five of most time on stream. I have to be careful with
[921.37s -> 928.86s]  that because oh, Nancy Drew, 20 hours. Nancy Drew is like Nancy Drew, 40 hours. Nancy Drew is like
[928.86s -> 937.05s]  180 hours of Nancy Drew that trumps every single game I've ever played. Oh shit. I can press the
[937.05s -> 948.60s]  button and go in. I didn't know that. I'm going to use the fireball here. Right in front. Get in
[948.60s -> 968.01s]  there. Give me the bonus. Bonus. Give it to me. No. No. Get in there. Does it close? Get in. Get in.
[968.01s -> 988.09s]  Get in. No. Yes. What is this for? 75. Is this a magnet? Let's the orbs stick to the magic one
[988.09s -> 995.98s]  when they collide. Oh, that's pretty good. For 75 though. I don't know about that.
[1000.10s -> 1006.28s]  This is just another live. I think I'm going to get replenish his magic. I'm going to get this.
[1007.96s -> 1011.48s]  Yeah, that feels, look at my bar. All right. Cool. All right. I'm going to save the rest.
[1012.20s -> 1036.94s]  What is this? I don't get it. What did I just do? Is that a curse? Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. What? What's
[1036.94s -> 1062.22s]  wrong? Are there bosses in this game? Yeah. He doesn't know. What happened? Oh, I had 666 coins.
[1063.02s -> 1071.61s]  Now I see your concern. It's okay. I'm fine. I feel like I don't want to touch that.
[1072.57s -> 1090.98s]  There are other spells available when the ball hits the paddle. Really? Oh shit. There is. What
[1091.06s -> 1100.17s]  is the, what does K do? Get in there. Get stuck up there. Come on. Get stuck up there. Get in the
[1100.17s -> 1109.46s]  middle and bounce around all over the place. Oh shit. There is. Oh, it turns into fire.
[1110.26s -> 1118.44s]  I don't have enough to do it. What is, what's, I don't understand. That's all my magic is gone.
[1119.16s -> 1141.78s]  I don't know what that did for the chest though. Get up close. Fairy lets you control the ball. Oh,
[1144.55s -> 1153.38s]  very cool. Streamer plays mobile game for 6K viewers. This game ain't even, this
[1153.38s -> 1156.42s]  ain't even on mobile. What are you on about? You can't even get this on mobile.
[1157.54s -> 1171.06s]  You should be able to. I feel like it would be hard on mobile. You have to have your finger
[1171.06s -> 1176.39s]  on the screen just drag back and forth like crazy. I mean, maybe it would not be hard.
[1177.35s -> 1188.87s]  A lot of money. That was awesome. How is that hard? It just, it is. Your finger gets like
[1188.87s -> 1195.13s]  greasy and shit and you can't register. By the way, I think this game is like $2. I'm not kidding.
[1195.13s -> 1209.93s]  This game is like $2 or $3. Tops. No, I can still save it. Just get up there. Get in there. Come on.
[1210.01s -> 1226.58s]  I can still do it. Yes. No. Get up there. Don't break this. Whatever. It's over. Okay. That's
[1226.58s -> 1236.65s]  amazing. I just was shocked. That's awesome. It goes through everything. The save up for that one
[1239.03s -> 1263.13s]  is literally $3. Yeah. This game is $3. I think I'm playing pretty well. Ooh, that was close.
[1264.01s -> 1280.10s]  All right. I'm just going to get it. Kill the two bears. There it is. What's left? What is left?
[1282.30s -> 1295.48s]  Oh, the top left corner. Shit. All right. Let me just box top left. I got it. $4. Wow. This game
[1295.48s -> 1311.54s]  must be bad. $4 must be awful then. No, if a game, it might be fun. No, I want to. Ooh,
[1311.62s -> 1329.66s]  not worth it. I'll buy this. Saving. You're a real stinker. What do you mean?
[1330.46s -> 1341.83s]  I want the magnet. Well, I want to fix the town up first. I don't want to just go straight for the
[1341.83s -> 1366.57s]  magnet. I think that's using keys. What about the left door? Get in that left door. All right. I
[1366.57s -> 1384.78s]  got to feed it up there. Very gently. Damn it. Jesus. Get up there. Yes. What about the button?
[1384.78s -> 1398.12s]  I didn't get the button. I feel completely unsatisfied. Oh, I feel terrible right now.
[1398.84s -> 1419.83s]  All right. Watch this. Jesus. Give me it. Yeah, that's pretty damn good. I don't want to get...
[1424.23s -> 1432.92s]  What? Teleport spell? I didn't want to get grabbed. I still don't know what the grab does.
[1442.55s -> 1451.54s]  You're cheating. You lose money. Oh, that's terrible. How much do you lose? I feel like
[1451.54s -> 1469.10s]  my paddle is smaller. Or am I making that up? Oh my god. I'm not making this up.
[1470.30s -> 1480.18s]  Sorry, I got plenty of lives. You've always had a small paddle. I don't even know what you're
[1480.18s -> 1498.07s]  referring to. Keep going. No, no. Turn, turn. Yes. We can just watch the movie play out.
[1498.79s -> 1517.19s]  Here it is. I don't even have to do shit. Telekinesis achievement. I want to see another
[1517.19s -> 1525.56s]  scare Saturday. Well, a scary game that I want to play has got to come out. This one's odd. Although
[1525.56s -> 1537.96s]  I can go straight up. Do I have a key? I've got two keys. Oops. Get in. The same magnet. I feel like
[1537.96s -> 1548.02s]  I'm trying to get it. I mean, it's just going to be here every time. I'm getting it. And I'm getting
[1548.02s -> 1556.36s]  the heart. No, I'm not. Yeah. Fuck it. I'll give you the magic. Yeah. All right. I'm up. Should I
[1556.36s -> 1564.44s]  get the heart too? All right. I got plenty of money. Wait, what? Adds one life. Oh, I can buy
[1564.44s -> 1572.95s]  this as many times as I want. All right. I'm doing five and I'm up. Watch it. I'm going to sneak it
[1572.95s -> 1582.74s]  through right there. Does it keep the same trajectory? No, you can actually move it.
[1582.74s -> 1602.98s]  That's great. Maybe it does. It's not cheating. It's an item in the game. So I got to use
[1605.00s -> 1615.90s]  so much magic. I couldn't get them both. You know, I couldn't. Am I in easy mode? Well,
[1615.90s -> 1638.95s]  this is level one. I have to assume it gets harder after this. Sure it does. Kappa. I actually
[1638.95s -> 1651.26s]  don't like it. I'm trying to figure out how the trajectory works. So I think it just keeps
[1651.26s -> 1661.74s]  following. No, it doesn't. I thought it kept following the path. It's based on where it is
[1661.74s -> 1668.57s]  on the paddle. That makes sense. So I want to get it on the left side. Like this. And then,
[1668.57s -> 1687.21s]  yeah. All right. I feel you. I feel you. Come on. Get over there. Nice. VIP this person? VIP who?
[1688.74s -> 1697.13s]  Somebody here? I'm falling asleep here. That's all right. We're just chilling.
[1698.49s -> 1703.06s]  We're just chilling right now. I'm relaxing. I'm just fucking chilling.
[1704.65s -> 1710.97s]  Just lying back. Yeah, this is like pretty nice actually. This is pretty nice to me.
[1715.48s -> 1720.68s]  Honestly, all I need right now is just a large pizza. I just want a large pizza.
[1723.66s -> 1733.05s]  After every level, I take just a huge bite of like this crispy pepperoni pizza. You know what I mean?
[1735.77s -> 1744.65s]  I love pizza. I know. Every time somebody, when you ask anyone what their favorite food is
[1744.65s -> 1751.61s]  from the second to the eighth grade, pizza. But I love pizza. That's seriously the best. One of
[1751.61s -> 1761.66s]  my favorite things on earth. I would probably still have like the fourth grade answer. French
[1761.66s -> 1782.60s]  fries? No. Pizza. Pipo happy. Pizza. It's so good though. It really is. I could probably eat pizza
[1782.60s -> 1802.22s]  every single day. You know, I could. That sounds bad. I'm just saying. I'm not going to do it,
[1802.22s -> 1807.11s]  but I probably could. I'm actually pretty easy to please when it comes to food.
[1807.91s -> 1815.27s]  I really am. There are people that would say like, man, I mean, I've eaten pizza like four times
[1815.27s -> 1820.15s]  this week. Fuck that. I want something else. And I'm the guy that's like, yeah, fuck that.
[1821.91s -> 1825.99s]  I would eat it again though. If you like wanted to get it, I would eat it. I would eat it every day.
[1826.63s -> 1838.50s]  I'm pretty easy to please. Yeah, fuck that. I've had pizza like three times this week.
[1838.50s -> 1844.42s]  Fuck. But I mean, like what else is open? I mean, it's like, we could go to like McDonald's,
[1844.42s -> 1848.34s]  but that's like, I mean, what else is open? And we don't have fucking options besides maybe like
[1848.34s -> 1871.58s]  pizza. And that's true though. It actually is. But Uber Eats is a thing now. Oh, hold on. We've got
[1871.58s -> 1884.68s]  a boss battle. Do I have a health bar? How does this work? Holy shit. All right. All right. I got
[1884.68s -> 1915.43s]  to get like the... I'm wasting these shots. No, we are. All right. Giant wolf. Watch it. Yeah,
[1915.43s -> 1922.41s]  there aren't many, there really aren't that many foods I could eat every day. But pizza. Uh oh.
[1929.61s -> 1946.87s]  Very small. Tiny. First boss. Seven lives too. All right. Am I going back to town?
[1947.59s -> 1959.13s]  There's another slime fort. No, let's go back to town. Kingdom of Gerudo. All right. Who do we,
[1960.17s -> 1966.44s]  who do we give money to? I have 1400. I love my tavern. I'll be ruined. I'll miss all the
[1966.44s -> 1971.08s]  gossip going around. Donate. Yeah, let's get the tavern going. You just saved my business. Please
[1971.08s -> 1979.22s]  accept this reward. You got an extra life. All right. Well, we're going to get a tavern.
[1980.98s -> 1986.58s]  What is this? An enormous flying eye struck my house with a lightning bolt and burnt it to the
[1986.58s -> 1997.45s]  ground. Yeah. All right. Let's get your house built. Got a key. Woof woof. Donate to the dog?
[1999.54s -> 2011.74s]  Barf. You got a key. Let's open up the shop. I need a nice shop. What should I do? All right.
[2011.74s -> 2020.17s]  I gotta do the shop. Yeah. 750. Shop will be open after I do one more. All right. I got three keys,
[2020.17s -> 2041.98s]  eight lives. Let's go to the next area. Slime forest. Level two, one. Wait, do I keep everything
[2041.98s -> 2056.28s]  from lab? Oh, I do. I keep everything. I still have the magnet. That's pretty awesome. I gotta
[2056.28s -> 2074.04s]  get in the corner. Get up there. Dammit. Dammit. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come
[2074.20s -> 2095.21s]  on. Magnet run. Magnet run. Why can't I go in there? Is there a button somewhere missing?
[2097.90s -> 2108.01s]  Get it. I almost have 10 health. Oh, there's one problem I'm seeing with the magnet. I can't do the
[2108.01s -> 2128.98s]  fireball. I don't think the fireball is possible to do because it gets stuck. How do I get in that
[2128.98s -> 2142.90s]  door? Drop the magnet or I'm going to bed. Relax. What? This is just a slime room.
[2143.86s -> 2165.11s]  Holy fuck. That was okay. I had to use it. Wait, what's my what happened? My paddle's back to normal.
[2165.75s -> 2172.36s]  I don't have the magnet anymore. I draw. Okay. You're staying up then. You're not going to bed
[2172.36s -> 2195.38s]  anymore. You lose whatever you get when you. Oh, that sucks. Okay. Well, good to know. Holy shit,
[2195.38s -> 2215.53s]  dude. Germ is a god at breakout. I appreciate that. Thank you. What's going on? Oh, I think I just got
[2215.53s -> 2222.66s]  luigi'd. If it becomes impossible, it just gives it to you. That's pretty cool. I'm going to sneeze
[2222.66s -> 2242.15s]  though, just to make everyone aware. I do actually like breakout. It's fun. I don't know what that
[2242.15s -> 2256.44s]  does, but I don't want those bad apparently somehow. Germa, how do you I don't even know
[2256.44s -> 2262.92s]  what that is. I'm not going to answer it. What do these slimes do? I'm terrified to touch them.
[2263.56s -> 2271.66s]  Germa, quick. Give me your opinion on this thing. You don't know what it is.
[2272.71s -> 2297.34s]  Oh, all right. He knows. He doesn't. He doesn't actually know. I don't know what you're doing.
[2297.34s -> 2314.54s]  Guys, I didn't know what uh-oh stinky was. Why would I know what anything else is? And yes,
[2314.54s -> 2324.38s]  I've seen the video. I've seen it. How do you know what ayayaya is? Well, that's easy because
[2326.30s -> 2329.26s]  you know how many times I've seen that link put in chats on Twitch?
[2329.98s -> 2334.46s]  You know how many times I've been linked that video randomly by people? You know how many times
[2334.46s -> 2338.62s]  I've seen that random thing pop up? I've seen those words pop up a hundred times.
[2339.66s -> 2352.79s]  Apologize. I already did. I said I was sorry like five times.
[2357.34s -> 2360.62s]  How many times do I have to apologize? Do I have to apologize every day?
[2361.66s -> 2370.81s]  Hey everybody. Welcome to another stream. This is stream number 15 since the ayaya incident.
[2371.45s -> 2375.77s]  Just want to make sure I make this really well aware. I'm really sorry about that.
[2375.77s -> 2397.46s]  I'm incredibly sorry. I'm embarrassed about it. Ooh, huge paddle. All right, that's good. Is this
[2397.46s -> 2405.05s]  even any bigger? It doesn't even look that bad. Much bigger. Yeah, I have to apologize every day
[2405.61s -> 2420.62s]  for saying the... doing the ayayaya thing. I have to say sorry every day. All right, I don't die
[2420.62s -> 2430.36s]  because you'll lose your power-ups. I have to shoot them. God damn it. Come on. And I didn't
[2430.36s -> 2445.35s]  even need to do that. Ugh. You have to apologize to God. Apologize on Twitter. I already did my
[2445.35s -> 2456.33s]  apology. I already said I was sorry. I don't have to... what? I'm not apologizing on Twitter.
[2457.13s -> 2461.93s]  That would break my... uh-oh. Get it off. Oh! Now that would break my rule of having
[2462.73s -> 2480.95s]  like five tweets a year that aren't going live tweets. Get in that cave. It's gonna be a bonus
[2480.95s -> 2500.78s]  for my Jess. Know it. You have five new tweets? No, I don't. What are you spamming here? Attention
[2500.78s -> 2505.02s]  parents and grandparents. Herbal life. Hold on. You're gonna make me pause the game for this.
[2506.06s -> 2512.81s]  Get in the cave. Fall in cave. Fall in cave. Attention parents. I don't even know what it is.
[2514.94s -> 2531.50s]  Look at all this money. This is crazy. Oh, I got them all so far. Come on. Keep it going.
[2545.99s -> 2560.44s]  Get them all. Yep. I'm gonna get them all. Funny memes. Have you ever listened to penis music
[2560.44s -> 2571.42s]  before? You just replaced a noun with the word penis. That's all you did. I mean, come on. You
[2571.90s -> 2587.46s]  gotta get a little more effort than that. It's gotta be some more effort than that.
[2592.22s -> 2595.74s]  You guys critique my jokes sometimes. It's time to critique yours.
[2604.39s -> 2620.58s]  Just kidding. I'm not gonna hit that one ever. I got nine lives. I'm gonna be doing just fine.
[2623.59s -> 2629.64s]  You cry laughing at fart noises. So did you. Don't throw stones if you live in a glass house.
[2639.94s -> 2650.89s]  Some of you... I can pretend that you didn't, but you know. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Where'd it go?
[2650.89s -> 2666.42s]  Wait, is Pac-Maning? It's Pac-Maning. Holy shit. It is Pac-Maning. I don't know. This is perfect.
[2666.42s -> 2673.06s]  I don't have to do anything. I'm gonna shoot this one. Didn't even need... All right. No, no, no,
[2673.06s -> 2692.36s]  no. Get that chest. Yes. Yes. Did a raid just come in? Or am I crazy? Why is it not listed here?
[2701.02s -> 2707.43s]  Was there a raid? It's not on my... Why is it not on my streamlabs? It's... I mean, it says that...
[2708.15s -> 2726.12s]  Who came in with the raid? It was a while ago? When was it? Hold on. Where? No, it wasn't. No,
[2726.12s -> 2737.50s]  this just happened like right now. Why is this... I swear to god, I just saw that a raid came in.
[2740.97s -> 2763.18s]  From... from... from GMART? Am I making this up? I swear to god. I'm... I have to be insane. I swear
[2763.18s -> 2771.06s]  to god, I looked over and I saw it. Thank you for fucking raiding. Seriously. Thanks for the raid.
[2771.06s -> 2788.12s]  I swear to god this happened. I'm not crazy. No, somebody look up... Is somebody like... Is
[2788.12s -> 2793.24s]  somebody hosting this channel right now called like called like GMART or something? It was like
[2793.24s -> 2798.92s]  600 people. I swear to god. I'm not... I'm not insane. Thank you so much for the raid. Seriously.
[2815.78s -> 2819.14s]  No, yeah. Thanks a lot. Seriously. Whatever you were doing, hopefully you had a good time.
[2819.78s -> 2827.06s]  We're playing. We are playing. I just lost my paddle. Fuck. Uh, we're playing this breakout
[2827.06s -> 2837.75s]  game. It's only three dollars on Steam. You can do shit like that. Pretty damn cool. Uh, welcome
[2837.75s -> 2852.38s]  though. Welcome. Get it. Sponsored. Sponsored by a three dollar game. What are you talking about?
[2855.29s -> 2873.83s]  This was made with passion and love. And they're charging almost nothing for it. Gah! I thought
[2873.83s -> 2881.35s]  I was gonna bounce higher. All right, I'm... I can't... I can't get cocky. That was pretty pog
[2881.35s -> 2895.21s]  champ right there, I'll tell you. That was pog. Yeah, like I said again, welcome.
[2897.35s -> 2905.91s]  That... I'm saying... I'm saying your name right? GMART, right? GMART. You're so bad at this.
[2905.91s -> 2912.57s]  But I'm hard. What are you talking about? So why did that not show up in my streamlabs? I saw it
[2912.57s -> 2949.66s]  like blow by the chat. That's a lot of free... that... that's two free lives. I wonder how many
[2949.66s -> 2972.07s]  levels are in the game. Holy fuck. Another door. Another key. What is this? The orb starts at speed
[2972.07s -> 2991.37s]  twice slower. Yeah, let's get it. And here's world magic too. Holy shit. Wait. Oh, I didn't
[2991.37s -> 2999.43s]  want to do that. Yeah, that's too slow. I just increased the time I'm gonna play the game by
[2999.43s -> 3018.41s]  50% or 100%. That's all I did. More time on stream. Yeah, I don't like this. I want it to be faster.
[3025.66s -> 3030.78s]  No, I didn't want to do that either. Fuck. I'm gonna... all right, I'm gonna let it fall. I'm gonna
[3030.78s -> 3039.16s]  let it fall. I'm gonna let it fall. Just fall. I don't want this anymore. I still have it, don't I?
[3039.88s -> 3061.14s]  Do I still have it? I get... no, I don't. I feel like this is slower. I know. I'm trying to get it. I
[3061.14s -> 3083.69s]  can't get it. It's too... it's a weird spot. The reaction times have ascended here. Yeah, just throw
[3083.69s -> 3105.88s]  coins in the trash. You're right. Unfortunate. Unfortunate. Damn it! I tried. I tried to get this
[3105.88s -> 3110.04s]  sneaking in there. Oh, it would have been awesome too. You know, it would have been so cool.
[3110.92s -> 3136.89s]  Oh well. I would have eaten everything. How many of you guys got a pizza? Seriously, how many?
[3137.61s -> 3155.82s]  At least like three of you? Actually you? Good. Explain how it tastes to me. How is it? Like,
[3155.82s -> 3165.00s]  what is it? Is it crunchy? Is it doughy? Is it deep? Explain it to me in full detail. Is the sauce
[3165.00s -> 3172.58s]  tangy? Is the sauce... is it like thin sauce? Is it soupy? You know, don't ever think that a soup pizza
[3172.58s -> 3180.04s]  is bad. All right. If you don't get it, me and Burger Boy used to call them soup pizzas because
[3180.04s -> 3185.72s]  when you got a fresh hot pizza that was so hot that just came out of the oven, where the cheese,
[3185.72s -> 3193.24s]  the sauce, and the oil all mixed together into this moving lava and you pick up a piece of pizza
[3193.80s -> 3200.02s]  and it's just... the whole thing is liquid. That's a soup pizza. And don't... don't think that a
[3200.02s -> 3213.37s]  soup pizza is not good. It can be very good. Sometimes it's like, all right, this sucks,
[3213.37s -> 3218.41s]  but it's a soup pizza. It's pretty good. You'll pick up a slice and it all just starts... it's
[3218.41s -> 3223.37s]  all liquid, all really, really thin, and you have to fold it together and like keep... you can't
[3223.37s -> 3230.30s]  happen to do this shit. Hold on. Pause it. You keep having to do this shit. Can you guys even see me?
[3233.16s -> 3236.92s]  You have to... you keep having to do this, right? So you have to keep going like...
[3237.98s -> 3247.45s]  like fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold over and over again with the cheese. He's handsome?
[3252.47s -> 3261.45s]  Yes, I am. You'll go in for a bite and everything will start to fall and you put your hand under
[3261.45s -> 3267.21s]  here and your hand's like accepting hot lava and you like fold it back up on top of the pizza
[3267.21s -> 3273.77s]  and like... and you keep folding it on top of each other and eating it and eventually you like churn
[3273.77s -> 3285.34s]  it like butter. That's sometimes... it sucks, but sometimes it's okay. Sometimes it's actually
[3285.34s -> 3299.19s]  exactly what you're looking for. Worst noise of 2020. Well, I will make sure you clip it because
[3299.19s -> 3319.54s]  you'll make sure you remember where it is. Dammit, it's not gonna hit it, is it? Yes, it is.
[3320.10s -> 3336.36s]  Do you own more than three shirts? Yes, I do. These are comfortable. You have no idea how
[3336.36s -> 3343.59s]  comfortable this... this Nightwing shirt is. You have no idea. It's ridiculous. It is the most soft,
[3343.59s -> 3349.19s]  wonderful material and it's washed. I wear it a couple times and you wash it. It's the most
[3349.19s -> 3358.49s]  comfortable... it's one of the most comfortable things I own. Plus, I like to fucking like pretend
[3358.49s -> 3367.67s]  I'm Nightwing. Not even... not as cool as Batman and I used to be Robin, remember me? But I got two
[3367.67s -> 3379.53s]  fucking batons now. Cool... it's cooler than Robin and like definitely like... definitely like sexier
[3379.53s -> 3384.41s]  than Batman. You know what I mean? Nightwing. Bruce Wayne ain't got nothing on me, okay?
[3385.53s -> 3392.86s]  What's it... what's it... Drew Carey? What's his name? Not Drew Carey. Who is Nightwing?
[3398.06s -> 3404.73s]  Who is Nightwing? Not Bruce Wayne. I'm talking about Nightwing.
[3410.68s -> 3418.79s]  Yeah, Drew Carey. Good, good. Drew Carey can be Nightwing if you want.
[3426.76s -> 3430.28s]  Did you see how fucking pogchamp that just was? That was the most pog...
[3430.28s -> 3449.50s]  put... nominate that shit. Watch this. Ready? What is that? Oh my goodness.
[3451.40s -> 3482.15s]  Fuck. It's okay. Yeah, Batman's old news. God damn it. I didn't move my hand fast enough.
[3487.62s -> 3497.46s]  Dude, he's begging for nominations. Eye roll. Uh, me and Joel are gonna play the bomb game. Yes,
[3497.46s -> 3503.91s]  we were supposed to play it today, but uh he kind of last second got uh ill. I think he was
[3503.91s -> 3509.86s]  feeling under the weather. So instead of it being... all right let's... we want... we want
[3509.86s -> 3516.10s]  Joel to be in, you know, peak health while we do that. So he wasn't feeling well. So I just was
[3516.10s -> 3519.22s]  like, you know what, fine, it's all good. I'll just do something else today and we'll do it tomorrow.
[3521.91s -> 3532.04s]  Obviously, uh, if Joel's feeling all right. Otherwise we'll do something else. There we go,
[3532.04s -> 3545.98s]  get in there. Should I do the bigger paddle? Yeah. And... no, that's fine. Joel's streaking
[3545.98s -> 3553.50s]  the bomb game right now. Now that would have actually been pretty hilarious. Um, can you
[3553.50s -> 3560.14s]  imagine if... hey, sorry, um, no, we're not doing it... and then just streaking it with somebody else.
[3561.02s -> 3575.26s]  You'd be like, oh shit. No, I can assure you that is not the case. I don't like these ice blocks.
[3575.90s -> 3593.66s]  Don't do it. Neither does... whoa! Whoa! I don't like ice blocks. Oh! And neither does...
[3596.47s -> 3611.85s]  oh! Anybody that played WoW PvP back in 2005. Fuck! I tried to stop it. I'm sorry. I fucking
[3611.85s -> 3616.49s]  couldn't stop. I couldn't stop it. I couldn't stop it. I had to say... I had... I couldn't stop.
[3617.13s -> 3626.60s]  I tried to stop. Don't worry, I'll apologize for the next, like, five days straight. Don't worry.
[3627.24s -> 3654.52s]  You're a psycho. Who said that? Okay, no. I love this game. This game's actually fun.
[3655.56s -> 3666.41s]  Uh, this is just a fun game just to sit here and just dick around. Come on, get back in there.
[3666.41s -> 3673.24s]  Is there a button I can press? But no, long story short, yeah, we'll do, uh,
[3673.24s -> 3677.16s]  keep talking and nobody explodes tomorrow. We're very prepared for it.
[3678.04s -> 3683.34s]  Like I said earlier, I think a lot of people really are underestimating just how much we're
[3683.34s -> 3690.63s]  going to be prepared for these streams. Or these stream, whatever it is. I'm going to take it dead
[3690.63s -> 3696.07s]  serious. Even if he does not take it seriously, I'm going to take it as dead serious as humanly
[3696.07s -> 3701.19s]  possible. I'm going to try as hard as I can. I'm going to be very clear with my instructions.
[3702.07s -> 3704.95s]  I'm not gonna, whoa, what if I say this and like fuck it up?
[3706.60s -> 3717.85s]  Laugh. Laugh. Uh, nope, not gonna happen. Oh dude, I'm gonna say cut like the blue wire and he's
[3717.85s -> 3721.37s]  gonna cut it. He's gonna explode and it's gonna be, nope, I'm gonna be trying as hard as I fucking can.
[3730.01s -> 3753.02s]  Whoa, he actually, he can get attacked? I'm so excited for the explode joke next stream.
[3754.22s -> 3761.05s]  That's not gonna happen. I mean, maybe, we're probably gonna lose. It's a very complicated
[3761.05s -> 3788.01s]  game. Is it dead? Jelly? What did I just get? Keep pogging and nobody explodes. Should I go back?
[3788.01s -> 3803.93s]  Yeah, let's go back and see what the town looks like now. Oh, look at this. I can go in the houses.
[3803.93s -> 3812.07s]  Oh, it's the, it's the tavern. This is cool. I guess this has opened up me. Heard that everywhere,
[3812.07s -> 3818.49s]  else in Gerudo, people turned into ghosts and vanished. Isn't that creepy? Do you sell stuff?
[3819.13s -> 3833.24s]  Can I play piano? I don't think so. Oh, a chest. Uh, I'm not sure I can do anything with this yet.
[3838.18s -> 3851.77s]  Dog? Oh, I can't take their, okay. I would have never believed that such a hideous creatures existed
[3851.77s -> 3867.82s]  if I hadn't seen them with my own eyes. She's talking about you? Can I go to the dog house?
[3868.62s -> 3914.74s]  I want to do it too. All right, I did the shop. Let's go to the shop. I already own all this stuff.
[3915.38s -> 3927.16s]  I'm out. Slow. All right. Uh, farmer? The windmill. Watermill. People are starving. 350. Yes. Thank
[3927.16s -> 3937.82s]  you. You got an extra life. Good. Uh, can I repair this or provide the entire town with milk? All
[3937.82s -> 3948.68s]  right, let's fix the farm. 350. Except this, you got an extra life. Cool. Anything else need to be
[3948.68s -> 3954.50s]  fixed? Couple houses up here. What is this for? The mayor carries more for his citizens than for
[3954.50s -> 3960.10s]  himself. I'd rebuild this house if I had the funds. 999. All right, well, I don't have that.
[3962.20s -> 3979.26s]  All right, well, let's just build this house back up then. Omega low link. I had to like double take
[3979.26s -> 4007.10s]  for a second here. Bomb game. Don't tell the German. Don't tell him. Don't tell him. Imagine
[4007.10s -> 4021.48s]  this is real. Imagine if it was real. Now that would be ridiculous. All right, this is terrible.
[4021.48s -> 4030.23s]  These monsters took away everything. Here. 250. I got a key. What about you? Do what you need.
[4031.53s -> 4036.09s]  How could those monsters destroy a statue? Boo hoo. Donate 500 for the statue. I don't have it.
[4036.09s -> 4042.46s]  All right, let's go. This buddy gave me these meatballs. One pound spaghetti ground beef.
[4042.46s -> 4048.78s]  Bread and crumbs. Finally chopped parsley. Freshly grated parmesan plus more for serving.
[4048.78s -> 4063.69s]  One egg. Two garlic cloves. That sounds gross. I'm making meatballs. They're wrong.
[4063.69s -> 4088.44s]  I mean, well, I mean. What does that thing in the middle mean? Stay up there. Get up top. Oh,
[4088.44s -> 4105.21s]  my fucking hand slipped. It's all right. I don't have any powerups anyways. Greed? Well, yeah,
[4105.21s -> 4127.88s]  I need that money to rebuild the whole town. Should have saved it. That was dumb. All right,
[4127.88s -> 4132.60s]  top five favorite superheroes or super villains. They can both be on the same list. Who are they?
[4133.48s -> 4144.73s]  That's a good question. Let's find out. Bator? That's not a superhero. That's just,
[4144.73s -> 4158.42s]  that's a word that I've said a few times. All right, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.
[4162.33s -> 4177.96s]  Hmm. Shit, this is tough. Who's, what's the, who's the best, coolest? It's too bad because I would
[4177.96s -> 4185.98s]  have said, I would say Deadpool. But Deadpool has been like meme-ified now. You know what I'm saying?
[4185.98s -> 4190.78s]  It's very hipster of me to say that. Deadpool is like too popular for me to say that now.
[4216.07s -> 4228.98s]  So many people were just like, what the fuck? Fuck you, man. Uh, no, all right, it's probably
[4228.98s -> 4247.02s]  Deadpool. Spider-Man, Deadpool. Lame. Stop! I'm trying to have conflicting, backtracking opinions.
[4247.02s -> 4253.37s]  Stop. Stop, stop it. Don't you understand? I'm, I'm saying something, engaging what everybody
[4253.37s -> 4259.56s]  says and then I'm just gonna go with what you are all saying and backtrack. I'm gonna make a
[4259.56s -> 4265.08s]  statement and then immediately tell you otherwise and see what you guys say and then I'm gonna,
[4265.08s -> 4282.06s]  that's what my opinion is gonna be? This guy's fucking smart. No, uh, for real though, no jokes,
[4282.06s -> 4291.78s]  no bullshit. It's probably Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Uh, it's Spider-Man. It's definitely Spider-Man.
[4291.78s -> 4296.44s]  It's Spider-Man. What's cooler than Spider-Man? Nothing's cooler than Spider-Man.
[4298.79s -> 4302.47s]  It's not Captain America. I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put my foot down there. It's not Captain
[4302.47s -> 4318.81s]  America. It's Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Venom. Aquaman. No, no, I don't think so. Not for me.
[4319.61s -> 4339.42s]  Although he makes great t-shirts, but not for a superhero. Um, some of the X-Men too. The problem
[4339.42s -> 4344.62s]  with the X-Men is the X-Men were so cool and then they made like the last two or three movies were
[4344.62s -> 4355.54s]  just real bad. So it's kind of, they gotta get the X-Men in somebody else's hands. The actors were
[4355.54s -> 4364.97s]  fine for the X-Men, I think. Um, when I was younger it was Gambit. What is this? The Magic
[4364.97s -> 4378.30s]  Wand launches three at once. Oh, fuck yeah. Gambit was my favorite superhero when I was like 14, 15,
[4378.30s -> 4389.88s]  16. It might still be. They even put Gambit anywhere, really. Besides the cartoon. Okay,
[4389.88s -> 4416.07s]  this is, I gotta have to show you guys some skill here. Do I get three balls at once forever?
[4417.61s -> 4446.71s]  Yeah, I do. All right, I gotta be really, really good here. Bat fucked it up. Sorry. What does Bat
[4446.71s -> 4463.75s]  even do? Is it taking my health? Wait, is it taking my health? It drains your magic. Ah, that sucks.
[4463.75s -> 4468.92s]  I'm so happy you get this for every level though. This is great. Not much I could do
[4468.92s -> 4489.37s]  there. Oh, fuck, that instantly kills you. I mean, yeah, the Avengers are cool. They're,
[4489.37s -> 4497.85s]  they're all right. They're interesting. Although, is it weird that I really only like those movies
[4497.85s -> 4518.86s]  because Spider-Man's in them? Even though they're good. I love that latest Spider-Man. That Spider-Man
[4518.86s -> 4530.65s]  movies are great. I love them. All of them. They're all so good. Me hate popular thing. Me interesting.
[4533.21s -> 4536.97s]  Spider-Man is insanely popular. He's like the most popular superhero ever.
[4537.93s -> 4542.31s]  It's, it's, it's, it's the Deadpool thing that I said, isn't it? People are gonna be mad at me now.
[4543.19s -> 4569.77s]  I love, I like Deadpool. I was just fucking, I was just joshing everybody. Super villain though.
[4570.33s -> 4600.55s]  Spider-Man superhero. What's the best villain? Freeze? That's not a bad pick. That's not a bad
[4600.55s -> 4618.92s]  pick. I don't know. Who else though? I like the Riddler. The Riddler's cool because the Riddler
[4618.92s -> 4627.51s]  doesn't even have any superpowers. He's just a dick. Like the Riddler doesn't have superpowers.
[4627.51s -> 4642.42s]  He's, he's just like, he's just like a really good lawyer. All right. Get the balls again.
[4642.98s -> 4656.28s]  He was super intelligent. Yeah, but that's all right. I mean, yeah, that's fine. But
[4657.08s -> 4667.06s]  Riddler sucks. Just tells shitty puns. I, I was kind of sad when in the Christopher Nolan series,
[4667.94s -> 4671.86s]  it was Bane. I really thought it was going to be the Riddler and we were going to get a Christopher
[4671.86s -> 4676.42s]  Nolan Riddler and that would have been, that would have been awesome. Can you imagine a
[4676.42s -> 4699.42s]  Christopher Nolan Riddler? Oh, I missed it. I have to keep him alive. Weren't they in talks to maybe
[4699.42s -> 4704.78s]  do a Riddler? Long time ago. Why do I feel like it was going to be Johnny Depp? Why have I like
[4704.78s -> 4724.09s]  heard that somewhere? Am I insane? Jim Carrey? Yeah, but the only Riddler we ever got on TV was
[4725.13s -> 4731.21s]  or in the movies was the guy from the sixties and Jim Carrey. And although I love Jim Carrey's
[4731.21s -> 4735.53s]  Riddler, it was more the Joker than it was the Riddler, but he still, it was good.
[4748.73s -> 4758.86s]  Get stuck in there. How did you even get out? The Arkham Riddler was the best one.
[4760.87s -> 4769.82s]  Yeah, that's pretty good. It was. We haven't got a TV or movie Riddler besides. I mean,
[4769.82s -> 4773.10s]  the one from Gotham. I haven't really watched Gotham though. Is that a good show?
[4773.90s -> 4789.30s]  Why am I not paying attention? I'm seeing a lot of conflicting opinions here. Of course not.
[4789.94s -> 4797.61s]  Wasn't the penguin good on that show though? I heard that was the reason to watch the show
[4797.61s -> 4816.46s]  because the penguin was really good. Oh, the wind. Yeah, I'm an idiot. Yeah. All right. If we
[4816.46s -> 4827.06s]  already got a really good penguin locked down, then we got to get him in a movie. Danny DeVito
[4827.06s -> 4832.82s]  was the best penguin. I mean, that's, that's not even up for debate though. Yeah, that's
[4833.70s -> 4843.16s]  But Danny DeVito, I don't know. How old is Danny DeVito now?
[4847.00s -> 4849.48s]  That movie is so awful, even though DeVito is great. Yeah.
[4856.95s -> 4862.89s]  I don't remember much of that movie, but I, no, I can't say that. Michael Keaton,
[4862.89s -> 4868.22s]  Michael Keaton's in that movie. It's automatically a good movie. If you guys
[4868.22s -> 4886.01s]  didn't know, Michael Keaton's like my favorite actor. All right, I gotta hold on. These things
[4886.01s -> 4896.20s]  launching around. Have I seen Birdman? Yes, I have. It was fantastic. He was great as
[4897.08s -> 4907.53s]  Batman. He was great in Birdman. He was great in Spider-Man. All the other, all the man movies.
[4907.53s -> 4926.44s]  He was great in Beetlejuice. God. Fuck. It's one of those scenarios where anytime there's a
[4926.44s -> 4932.28s]  Beetlejuice ever again, it's just going to be, uh, you're not Michael Keaton. I don't like this
[4932.28s -> 4936.76s]  movie. You're not Michael Keaton. No, like we can't, it's not going to work. And it is that it's not,
[4936.76s -> 4949.74s]  it's impossible. It has to be Michael Keaton. It can't be anybody else. It can't be. What is this
[4949.74s -> 4955.83s]  one? The above deals double damage until it's lost. Um, okay. I gotta read. Wait, does that mean I
[4955.83s -> 4973.78s]  got double damage and the three balls? Yeah. Michael Keaton is great. Well, so what other actors
[4973.78s -> 4992.26s]  do I really like? What's my superhero, uh, actor list? I think Michael Keaton, Tom Holland. Yeah,
[4992.26s -> 5000.06s]  but we'll, we'll see though. Tom Holland is awesome. Got a long career ahead of him. Ask
[5000.06s -> 5023.83s]  me in 15 years. Willem Dafoe, Jim Carrey. Yeah. Oh, Woody Harrelson. Yeah. Woody Harrelson's pretty
[5023.83s -> 5058.38s]  good too. I was trying to sneak it in. It's all right. Cape Lanchette is awesome and almost
[5058.38s -> 5083.48s]  everything. Who else? Ooh, Ryan Gosling. Yeah, he's done, he's done some good work. He's done some
[5083.48s -> 5102.74s]  good work. You're right. Die. Sorry. Fuck. I needed that. No, I didn't. Uh, you know who actually
[5103.78s -> 5111.22s]  tops that list besides Michael Keaton, uh, is probably Gene Wilder. Gene Wilder was
[5111.22s -> 5122.66s]  awesome in everything, in everything. The original Willy Wonka. Yeah. And way more on an
[5122.66s -> 5137.61s]  incredibly storied career. He was just so interesting. He was so funny and fun and
[5138.57s -> 5141.93s]  everything he said was just, you carried weight. It was, it was, it was amazing.
[5142.73s -> 5164.87s]  Gene Wilder influenced a lot of people that you watch now, including me. So you're here now.
[5165.67s -> 5179.75s]  Oh, fuck. Don't touch anything. God damn it. Why am I so stupid about that? I got to be
[5180.63s -> 5187.67s]  on my way. I want to know what this means. Somebody said, I feel like I'm at a family
[5187.67s -> 5192.55s]  get together. And then they said residence sleeper. Is it, wait, you mean this is as
[5192.55s -> 5201.45s]  boring as being at a family get together? What? Get, well, go get fucking Yahtzee or Uno. What
[5201.45s -> 5212.94s]  are you doing? Why is that my fault? Go open up Monopoly and play six rounds and then everybody
[5213.02s -> 5228.25s]  has to leave. Speaking of Monopoly, do you guys, like we should play Monopoly. Do I have Uno?
[5229.30s -> 5233.85s]  I don't even, I don't remember how to play Uno, if I'm honest with you. I really don't know.
[5233.85s -> 5246.12s]  You're supposed to be the entertainer. Yeah, but I got, I got, I got, I got that by, yeah,
[5246.12s -> 5252.38s]  but I'm like stuck here. I'm like in traffic right now. I'm in really relaxing traffic
[5253.18s -> 5264.62s]  and I'm, I'm all right. You have Uno. What do you mean I have? How do you know I have Uno?
[5268.66s -> 5283.75s]  How do you know that? You have Uno. You have the box. I don't, it came with your Xbox.
[5284.39s -> 5288.79s]  It comes with your Xbox. I bought this Xbox third party guys. I don't have Uno.
[5296.81s -> 5307.62s]  The? What is this? You have, I don't have Uno. Why is me saying I don't have Uno as strange as me
[5307.62s -> 5314.14s]  saying when I turn the faucet, no water comes out. What are you talking about? You fucking turn your
[5314.14s -> 5323.74s]  faucet. What are you, what? Like, no, it's not as, what are you talking about? He doesn't have
[5323.74s -> 5338.98s]  water in his house. It's a meme. Oh, I'm getting memed on. Okay. Well, sometimes it's hard to tell.
[5339.70s -> 5353.66s]  It's hard to tell. Everyone's saying it at the same time. I can't even hit that one.
[5353.66s -> 5364.79s]  This is the end. I gotta play that too. I gotta play No More Heroes 2. I can play Rhythm, uh,
[5364.79s -> 5375.50s]  Rhythm Heaven. I'm gonna be doing both beautiful Joes. We're fully, we're fully packed. All right,
[5375.50s -> 5400.73s]  boss battle. I gotta play God Hand. That's right. I got Tony Hawk's Underground. What else we got?
[5400.73s -> 5420.62s]  I got a whole list, guys. Shit. All right. Don't be an idiot. Uh, what else we got off hand?
[5420.62s -> 5428.54s]  Oh, the Surge 2. Yeah, the Surge 2. But I'm probably only gonna, I'm probably only gonna
[5428.54s -> 5438.23s]  play that for like two hours. All the Lord of the Rings PlayStation 2 games. All of them. Um,
[5438.23s -> 5459.54s]  holy shit, am I about to beat the game? Why are we here then? Because this is, uh, come on,
[5459.54s -> 5471.78s]  this is, this is unplanned scream. I have plans for everything else. All right, let's put a statue
[5471.78s -> 5488.10s]  up. Did I do, did I rebuild everything already? Wait, what about this house? You literally won't
[5488.10s -> 5494.87s]  get past the first part of Fellowship, I guarantee it. All right, I wouldn't, all right, I'm gonna
[5494.87s -> 5499.59s]  remember your name because when I get past level one in Fellowship of the Ring, I'm going to fucking
[5499.67s -> 5510.20s]  scream your name. What was your name? It's fake what? I'm gonna write that name down. I'm gonna
[5510.20s -> 5516.01s]  literally yell your name. I'm gonna yell your name when I get, when I'm done. Fake up. All right,
[5516.01s -> 5521.29s]  fake, fake rumble. You got it. All right. Yeah. I'm, when I am done with that, I'm screaming your
[5521.29s -> 5536.25s]  name. And I'm gonna turn the gain on my mic as high as it'll go. Oh, look at the farm. Oh,
[5536.25s -> 5543.62s]  this is cute. At least my daughter now has a decent place to live. We're at the end. This is
[5543.62s -> 5553.70s]  the last level, I think. This, look at this cute little game. This is, wow. Seriously. Wow.
[5555.38s -> 5560.82s]  Ooh, can I do anything here? King of Gerudo is valiant. People never starved under his reign.
[5560.82s -> 5578.70s]  He disappears and makes everyone sad. Cool. Jump in there and get crushed. But I'm the psycho.
[5579.42s -> 5587.93s]  All right, let's rebuild the house. 9.99. Do it. You have a heart of gold. Please accept this reward.
[5587.93s -> 5599.94s]  You got an extra life. It's the mayor's house. I have enough money. What about you? I haven't
[5599.94s -> 5603.70s]  talked to you the whole thing. I've heard that you can cast special magic spells if you press
[5603.70s -> 5611.80s]  a magic button when the orb hits the magic wand. Yes, I can. All right, let's get it.
[5613.48s -> 5635.59s]  The cursed castle. Here we go. Yeah, I got all the Lord of the Rings games.
[5636.47s -> 5642.31s]  What else we got? We got all that shit too. Oh, I was gonna bring this up because,
[5642.55s -> 5649.37s]  uh, not what a dodge. Um, I was talking about cleaning games and this is like, you know,
[5649.37s -> 5654.73s]  maybe three or four days ago when I last streamed before New Year's. And it was like, oh, you,
[5654.73s -> 5658.49s]  you would love Chibi-Robo. I'm like, all right, Chibi-Robo. Let's get it. That sounds like fun.
[5659.29s -> 5667.93s]  This fucking game is $200. Is this like some extremely rare video game? It's like 200 fucking
[5667.93s -> 5678.39s]  bucks. Somebody just said, I have it. Um, well, you might be able to make like at least 180 dollars.
[5680.79s -> 5685.77s]  Time to sell it. Yeah. Yeah. All, yeah. All of you sell it. All of you sell it. Flood the market.
[5685.77s -> 5691.02s]  Flood the market. So it comes down to like fucking 80 bucks. So all of you sell. So all of you sell.
[5694.46s -> 5704.79s]  All of you sell it. Somebody said they have two copies. Holy shit. You lose a life and it bounces
[5704.79s -> 5726.46s]  back up. This could get really bad. I just lost two lives in a row. Have I thought I'm playing
[5726.46s -> 5735.18s]  control? Yeah, but control sits kind of in that weird spot. Kind of a Jedi fallen order is.
[5735.82s -> 5743.70s]  It's something I want to do and want to play, but I, I just, I'm probably not gonna. And why is
[5743.70s -> 5762.34s]  this happening? Maybe I, it's on, it's on the list. It is, but it would have to, it's kind of, okay.
[5764.87s -> 5770.54s]  Just like Breath of the Wild. I still, I might play Breath of the Wild. I mean, I got, look,
[5770.54s -> 5775.10s]  I have to come clean with you guys. I have to be completely realistic. I did put on the list of
[5775.10s -> 5783.24s]  games, the ones that I've bought. Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games 2020. So how could I,
[5783.24s -> 5790.55s]  could I really play that without playing Breath of the Wild? I feel like that would be upsetting
[5790.55s -> 5817.74s]  to a lot of people. You're not going to get the lore of Breath of the Wild? Why not? But yeah,
[5817.74s -> 5822.70s]  also another game that I really, really want to play desperately. And this game is also
[5823.98s -> 5835.83s]  $250 for the GameCube. It's called Gotcha Force. Anybody remember that one? Game was
[5835.91s -> 5857.62s]  ridiculous. It was so much fun. Mario Sunshine is also on that list. What the fuck is this?
[5860.89s -> 5872.98s]  10,000 for the crown? Jesus. I'm, I'm not getting the crown. It's not going to happen.
[5879.78s -> 5890.41s]  I, I got distracted. So when you have this shit out, I feel the same way about multi-ball and
[5890.41s -> 5903.10s]  pinball. And so it's like, you need to have two eyes go in two different directions. Omega lol
[5903.10s -> 5917.94s]  bits. Wait, what? Hold on. Bilater just gave $250 in bits. 25,000 bits. Buy Gotcha Force,
[5917.94s -> 5925.58s]  you sweaty streamer fuck. I'm, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna buy Gotcha Force. So I'm
[5925.58s -> 5929.10s]  going to buy it and I'm going to own it. And then I'm going to be the guy that owns Gotcha Force.
[5930.14s -> 5940.89s]  I'll be one of like five people on earth and then I will lock it away. It's going to be an
[5940.89s -> 5951.53s]  asset that I hold for the rest of my life. Uh, but if I like to, Jesus, that's insane amount of
[5951.53s -> 5960.10s]  money again. Let's be clear. Again. Thanks a lot, dude. Seriously. Buy it now, you fucking liar.
[5960.10s -> 5987.59s]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna buy it. Jesus. Damn it. He's going to use, he's going to use it on pizza
[5987.59s -> 6000.73s]  instead. I'm going to buy a $250 pizza. I'm going to get a special ordered 600 foot wide pizza.
[6003.48s -> 6007.08s]  Make it, make it, make it real soupy this time too. Make it real soupy.
[6007.80s -> 6024.12s]  Yeah, make, make, make, make me an old fashioned, old fashioned way. I can't, I can't see. I can't,
[6024.68s -> 6030.20s]  I can't, I can't see. He can't see. I can't see. Why am I quoting It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World?
[6030.20s -> 6046.92s]  What the fuck is going on? That's a movie from like the fucking fifties. Have I quoted it before?
[6047.88s -> 6057.80s]  I, I, wait, hold on. I've quoted It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World before. When? I do it all the time?
[6065.22s -> 6077.29s]  Do I actually do this? It's under the big W. It was Smiley Grogan and the great tuna factory robbery.
[6077.93s -> 6092.89s]  Yeah, I used to watch the movie all the time when I was younger. In fact, when I was younger,
[6092.89s -> 6100.49s]  we had that movie recorded on a blank VHS tape, but the movie is so long that we never got to
[6100.49s -> 6106.17s]  see as kids the end of the movie because it was like 90 minutes for a VHS tape or something,
[6106.33s -> 6110.89s]  60 minutes. And we would always get to the apex of the entire movie and we never got to see it
[6110.89s -> 6116.73s]  because we didn't have the second part recorded. So we just watched the first like hour and 12
[6116.73s -> 6127.45s]  minutes of whatever it was. My parents used to just describe, oh, and by the way, this is what
[6127.45s -> 6141.86s]  happens at the end and blah, blah, blah. Oh yeah, okay, that's funny. I'll give, I'll give you a
[6141.86s -> 6154.79s]  dollar. Um, three dollars, three dollars. I'm remembering the whole movie. Ray, we're gonna
[6154.87s -> 6161.42s]  have to kill him at the gas station where Jonathan Winters is like freaking the fuck out and like
[6161.42s -> 6171.88s]  beating the shit out of those two guys. Okay. Has that movie influenced more in my life than
[6171.88s -> 6187.72s]  I give it credit for? Probably. I don't know. I mean, that was one of like six VHS tapes that I
[6187.72s -> 6195.64s]  had. So when I was, I don't know, 12, 10, nine, 10, 11, 12, I probably watched the first hour
[6195.64s -> 6218.74s]  and 10 minutes of that movie 150 times. Listen to your father. He's holding the two phones up
[6218.74s -> 6224.42s]  and the mother is like yelling at the daughter. He's holding the, he's on two different phones
[6225.14s -> 6229.70s]  and he's talking to his daughter and his mother and he holds the phones up together
[6229.70s -> 6235.45s]  so they can talk to each other. I gotta watch this movie again. That movie's fucking crazy.
[6243.86s -> 6246.34s]  On stream. That movie's not public domain. No way it is.
[6252.54s -> 6261.34s]  Mama, I'm coming. Mama, I'm coming to save you. It's, it's all coming back to me. It really is.
[6268.23s -> 6277.93s]  Now that's what we call walking in there. I still, I can't afford that.
[6285.18s -> 6289.58s]  There's that one scene where the two, where the two guys are fighting outside in like the sand,
[6289.58s -> 6295.18s]  like the desert area and they do, they do the classic, I think they like came up with it maybe.
[6295.18s -> 6301.18s]  I don't know but they did, they both throw a punch at each other and they, they connect with
[6301.18s -> 6309.16s]  their fists in the air and they get hurt. It's like fucking funny. They throw a punch at the
[6309.16s -> 6326.60s]  exact same time and they fucking smash fists together. That's hilarious, boomer. Hey, some of
[6326.60s -> 6342.50s]  it, come on. It's, it's, it's a, it's a comedy movie. It seriously has some great stunts in it.
[6343.22s -> 6354.57s]  Yeah, it really was. It really was like, I don't remember. All right, we're gonna get in that right
[6354.57s -> 6362.02s]  side and then we don't. It's over. What movie? The movie's called It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.
[6362.90s -> 6378.33s]  It's the actual title of the movie. It's public domain? No, it's not. It's public domain? Am I,
[6378.33s -> 6397.37s]  am I, wait, am I finally gonna get to see the end of this movie? Yeah, I still want to do that.
[6397.37s -> 6406.42s]  Watch public domain movies. In fact, I want to show you guys a skill called we're gonna watch
[6406.42s -> 6411.30s]  a bunch of public domain movies and we're gonna do what I do when I watch regular movies sometimes
[6411.30s -> 6416.34s]  on Netflix. And that's the, you'll get the gist of the entire movie. You watch for two minutes
[6416.34s -> 6421.86s]  and then you skip 20, watch for three minutes, skip 30 minutes, watch for five minutes, skip 10
[6421.86s -> 6449.75s]  minutes. Why would you do that? What do you mean why would I do that? I, some, guys, there are a
[6449.75s -> 6474.39s]  lot of movies that aren't very good and I just want to get the gist of them. You're a psycho,
[6474.39s -> 6482.76s]  what? And watch movies that are good. Yeah, but I sometimes, what's the last one I did it with?
[6482.76s -> 6496.81s]  I did it with Dad's Home 2? The one with John Cena and, no, yeah, the one with John, no. Will
[6496.81s -> 6503.99s]  Farrell? Will Farrell and, you've heard this before, yeah, it's the last, I'm telling you,
[6503.99s -> 6515.46s]  that's the last time I did it. Yeah, Mark Wahlberg, Will Farrell, yeah, I've seen that whole
[6515.46s -> 6520.55s]  movie. I just have to skip like 20 minutes every five minutes. You'd be surprised how many movies
[6520.55s -> 6531.94s]  you can watch and understand everything that's happening when you do this role. Can you just
[6531.94s -> 6562.18s]  get in there, please? Come here. Just read the Wikipedia. No, that's, that's way worse. Yeah,
[6562.18s -> 6567.21s]  at least I get to see some of the scenes in the movie and I only do this with movies that are
[6567.21s -> 6579.08s]  not good. Because I'm not going to do this with The Godfather. I think, like, the Sherlock Holmes
[6579.08s -> 6583.32s]  Will Farrell movie is not a movie I want to spend two fucking hours watching, so I'll watch it for
[6583.32s -> 6604.73s]  12 minutes. Plus, it means I can reference scenes so people think, you know, think I actually watched
[6604.73s -> 6611.50s]  the whole movie. I can reference specific quotes from the movie that I would, I, I wouldn't know
[6611.50s -> 6619.30s]  unless I saw it otherwise. So now at the office I can be like, remember that scene with the bees?
[6620.26s -> 6627.96s]  Hey, remember that scene in Dad and Daddy's Home 2 with the thermostat? They all freak out
[6627.96s -> 6630.76s]  and then they're like, who's changing the thermostat? And John Lithgow comes down,
[6630.76s -> 6654.90s]  it's like, it's not billions of degrees in here. See, it's not hard. All right, I, I don't want to
[6654.90s -> 6682.12s]  die here. This is like the last level. Clean it up. Clean it up. One, two. I could play Bubble
[6682.12s -> 6693.35s]  Bobble too. That's a classic game. And no, not, not Bust-A-Move. Not, ready, go! No, I'm talking
[6693.35s -> 6698.89s]  about the original Bubble Bobble. They really threw those two dragons on the bus, by the way.
[6699.85s -> 6702.73s]  Because like, where's, where's Bubble Bobble? Like, where's the other, where's the actual
[6702.73s -> 6720.97s]  Bubble Bobble game sequel? Bust-A-Move is better? That's, I don't think so. I don't think that's
[6720.97s -> 6730.28s]  correct. They took those two dragons and turned them into an iPad game. And have they even appeared
[6730.28s -> 6737.66s]  anywhere else ever? They were, they were really iconic characters. What happened to them? What
[6737.74s -> 6757.00s]  happened to those two dragons? They're public domain now. All right. But really, who owns those
[6757.00s -> 6769.50s]  characters? Are those Namco characters? No, Konami? Who owns the two dragons? Taiko? Taito? Okay.
[6770.22s -> 6777.96s]  What is, what has Taito done recently? Anything? Or did they get liquidated somewhere?
[6778.68s -> 6796.28s]  Nothing. They're under Square Enix now. Oh, okay. I'd love to see a new Bubble Bobble-inspired
[6796.28s -> 6820.41s]  video game with those two dragons. And I'm going to lose this game. Get in there. Finally. Get in
[6820.41s -> 6827.70s]  there. This was always the worst new plate breakout when you ended up with one that you needed to get
[6827.70s -> 6856.76s]  and it was just, you couldn't do it no matter what you did. Oh jeez. Square Enix owns it? No.
[6857.64s -> 6871.77s]  Now picturing the Bubble Bobble RPG. It'd probably be pretty fun. What are the characters that did,
[6872.41s -> 6877.21s]  because Taito was around right from the very beginning of the NES. They probably have a bunch
[6877.21s -> 6882.09s]  of characters. Are they, are they Snake, Rattle, and Roll? Is it Snake, Rattle, and Roll, they
[6882.09s -> 6911.46s]  Taito? Who owns Snake, Rattle, and Roll? Rare does? Why, what the hell are they doing? How have they
[6911.46s -> 6921.99s]  not done Snake, Rattle, and Roll too? I feel so bad for Rare because I really feel like they're
[6921.99s -> 6935.21s]  just like frozen in cryostasis. Like they have Rare frozen in cryostasis so Microsoft gets to
[6935.21s -> 6938.49s]  walk into the museum where they are and just look at them every once in a while and it'd be like
[6938.65s -> 6944.49s]  have a big cigar in their mouth being like, that's right, I remember, I remember Banjo-Kazooie.
[6945.53s -> 6949.05s]  Nobody else does. And then close the fucking door and lock it.
[6951.91s -> 6957.75s]  Spoilers for Star Wars, but who cares? Um, no, people, do people care about like the ones from
[6957.75s -> 6986.36s]  the 70s? Probably. Who gives a fuck? Oh no, that's right, that's not, it doesn't matter. I've already
[6986.36s -> 6993.29s]  talked about it on stream because I've already shown it on stream. You can't stop but now the
[6993.29s -> 7018.92s]  carbonite is gone. Yep, all right, that's true. How much money do you think that Raiden Solo makes
[7018.92s -> 7042.97s]  because that song exists? What do you think? It's probably a lot. Get in there. Wait, why is this
[7042.97s -> 7050.90s]  locked? Don't waste all your gold. Actually, I can, ready? This is gonna be a big moment for me.
[7050.90s -> 7058.38s]  No, it's not. I just like shook. I need more magic. I fucked it up. It's in Just Dance too.
[7059.10s -> 7073.56s]  Give me more magic. I could have done a huge line here. Do they still make Just Dance games? Yes,
[7073.56s -> 7080.84s]  yeah, they do. In fact, I think, I think they still release for the Wii. Original Wii, not Wii U.
[7081.56s -> 7108.82s]  It's accurate? Yep. Pepsi. The Wii is still going pretty strong from my understanding.
[7113.19s -> 7119.29s]  And the game cube. I love those little discs. Little game cube discs. Oh, they're so cool.
[7126.33s -> 7140.79s]  They're so cool. I can't wait to spend $500 on two discs. Door. Oh, door, door, door, yeah.
[7140.79s -> 7150.46s]  Come on, get in there. Don't. I can't. Ah, guys, it's hard to get in there.
[7151.34s -> 7186.98s]  Chibi-Robo. Look at this room. It's all treasure chests. Guys. Ooh, this is a fun game. This is a
[7186.98s -> 7190.98s]  cute little game. All right. Let me tell you. You can tell when a game is good. Guys, I've spilt
[7190.98s -> 7216.04s]  coffee on me that were more expensive than this. So come on. You. Time for the final boss. What
[7216.04s -> 7227.42s]  kind of coffee is that expensive? A, a Trenta iced Frappuccino with extra sugar, double milk,
[7227.42s -> 7254.02s]  double cream, 10 pumps of French vanilla. The drink is like $11. No, I don't owe to that.
[7254.66s -> 7296.46s]  Oh, what do I do? I do the thing. It's going fast. Things going fast. How big is the Trenta?
[7296.46s -> 7302.62s]  Anybody know? How many ounces? And how big is the super size that they like made it legal?
[7305.11s -> 7324.79s]  30 ounces. What's the super size? Super size is 80. Wait, a super size from McDonald's was 80
[7324.79s -> 7340.78s]  ounces? No. Holy shit. Wait, how many ounces is in a two liter? Was a super size as big as a two
[7340.86s -> 7363.99s]  liter? No magic allowed in the final boss. It's an instant kill. Only four lives left.
[7364.87s -> 7366.63s]  This could go to shit really quickly actually.
[7372.76s -> 7378.07s]  80 ounces is like three liters. I kind of want to look this up.
[7380.04s -> 7390.63s]  What's the, um, the biggest purchasable large drink? Big gulp from seven up.
[7392.09s -> 7398.63s]  Super size from McDonald's. Which one? What was it? Oh, fuck. There's another one. The nether world.
[7410.62s -> 7425.99s]  Wait, there's another one to build? Oh look, there it is. Is that me? There we go. All right,
[7425.99s -> 7436.98s]  this is the mayor's house. All right, so what do I talk to now? The four sacred children have the
[7436.98s -> 7440.34s]  power of summoning the forces of nature. They could help us if we could find them. I got them.
[7441.22s -> 7448.55s]  Have I ever heard of Fury? I've played Fury on stream. I think I got like halfway through it.
[7450.82s -> 7454.10s]  And then like a lot of games I've ever played on this channel years ago I sort of gave up on.
[7455.13s -> 7461.21s]  Yeah, I did. Like four years ago or something. Okay, this looks ridiculous.
[7466.58s -> 7475.43s]  We're in the nether. Go back? Go back to the map. I forgot about somebody?
[7477.03s -> 7497.18s]  There are only four lives left. Oh, my house is a real palace and now it's gone. Donate one
[7498.06s -> 7506.65s]  GP. Ha ha, gotcha. I've never had a house, but thanks. Today's a great day for Tarot.
[7506.65s -> 7511.13s]  Thanks to you this town will flourish once again. Again, once evil is vanquished. By the way,
[7511.13s -> 7520.76s]  we found this amulet piece in the debris. You got the fire amulet piece. What does that do?
[7521.32s -> 7537.46s]  All right, let's go. Oh, buy. I could buy. I'm even gonna buy stuff. I'm gonna buy hearts.
[7538.42s -> 7548.76s]  Oh, here we go. Here's the biggest big gulps. The original fountain drink from McDonald's was
[7548.76s -> 7560.38s]  seven ounces. All right, hold on. Let's see. Let's get this on stream. I want to look at this.
[7560.38s -> 7571.45s]  So, the biggest of big gulps. Kid-sized McDonald's in 2012 was 12 ounces.
[7574.50s -> 7582.71s]  Super-sized from McDonald's was 42 ounces. That's it? Great biggie from Wendy's,
[7582.71s -> 7595.26s]  the king size. They were all the same. The KFC mega jug? What is the KFC mega jug? The beast?
[7597.06s -> 7608.92s]  What is ARCO? I've never heard of ARCO. Like a gas station? The humongous come and go.
[7609.96s -> 7624.12s]  100. What the fuck? I feel like that's, is that a made up name? Is this real? No, it's a,
[7624.12s -> 7629.35s]  come and go is a convenience store. Okay. Well, why is it, why is it spelled like that? It's like,
[7629.35s -> 7638.89s]  kind of like humongous. Oh, okay. 100. Fuck it. The team gulp from 7-Eleven was 128 ounces.
[7639.85s -> 7650.23s]  What's the team gulp? This is just the thing that they dump on the coach
[7650.79s -> 7664.95s]  when people win the football game. Team gulp. Why would somebody order this? This is,
[7664.95s -> 7671.62s]  this is just a trash barrel with, you know, this is gross. This is just like a weird trash
[7671.62s -> 7695.67s]  barrel full of liquid. This is a gallon. Gross. Look at that thing. That's like the, that's the
[7695.67s -> 7702.18s]  thing that has fucking fertilizer in it in your garage. You don't want to drink out of that.
[7710.76s -> 7724.41s]  Propane tank? Yeah. Jesus. What is this? Is it a germ of gulp? This is, this is a coffee.
[7732.95s -> 7750.86s]  I hate this picture. No, I don't, I don't even want this on camera.
[7751.66s -> 7756.22s]  I don't want that on camera. That looks just, I don't like it. I do not like that picture.
[7756.22s -> 7764.06s]  I don't like it. I'm not leaving it. Oh wait, I was going to buy stuff here.
[7764.06s -> 7786.10s]  Let's refill all our magic. Let's get a bunch of health. Hey, one life. Oh, I'll do it to 10.
[7786.74s -> 7800.58s]  I think that's enough. 12. All right, I guess I need a thousand. Let's go. We want it back. We
[7800.58s -> 7809.58s]  want coffee mug back. No, it's just, I don't, that looks like a good cup of coffee though.
[7809.58s -> 7815.86s]  I love coffee. There's two things that are certain in life for me. That's pizza and coffee.
[7816.42s -> 7836.06s]  Both of them. Can I kill these things? Oh, they block. You fuckers.
[7839.98s -> 7858.31s]  Got him from behind. Oh shit. This is bad. Can you let us hear your BPM? Beats per minute,
[7858.31s -> 7862.90s]  like my heart. How would I even, how would you guys even be able to hear that?
[7870.20s -> 7873.24s]  Put the microphone off to my chest and mute everything and make everything really,
[7873.24s -> 7890.98s]  really quiet. I'm not even sure you still hear it. Get up there. Get up there. Try it. I feel
[7890.98s -> 7898.38s]  like a lot of people will leave if I do that. That's, I mean, I don't think people would want
[7898.38s -> 7912.01s]  to hear that. Can you imagine if I put my chest up here and it's like, like, holy fuck me. Jeremy,
[7912.01s -> 7933.05s]  go to the doctor. It's like, that's not normal. I got it in the mouth. Oh boy. Really could use
[7934.01s -> 7960.78s]  this right now. Damn it. I don't have any more. There it is. I don't want to die. This
[7960.78s -> 7971.62s]  reminds me of a cake. Yeah. It's kind of, it's kind of cakey. It's like a cake. Oh,
[7971.62s -> 7975.70s]  I forgot to show you guys. I got the, I got something cool. I got something cool.
[7977.46s -> 7998.92s]  Not like I forgot to show you guys. Oh yeah. I'll show you. This is tough. I don't want to lose
[7998.92s -> 8009.90s]  this. There's a lot of opportunity for me to lose and I don't want it right now. Not this. No, no.
[8017.85s -> 8027.61s]  Oh yes. This is a bonus room. I don't know. I'll show you after. Well, before I turn the stream
[8027.61s -> 8036.02s]  off, I'll show you. What level is this one? All right. I'm going to sneak it up underneath.
[8036.02s -> 8054.52s]  No, there we go. It's stuck. Get stuck. Get stuck. Get stuck. Get in there. Get stuck. Show us. I
[8054.52s -> 8060.94s]  got, you mentioned the cake thing. Oh, that instantly kills me. I just lost two lives.
[8061.82s -> 8077.80s]  Oh, I got, I got a great portrait of cake Mario. It's going up. I'm going to hang on to magic.
[8078.60s -> 8083.78s]  In fact, I actually may. Is it cake Mario though? I get a further inspection. I'll look at it in a
[8083.78s -> 8106.26s]  minute. I think it's cake. Yeah, it's cake Mario. Chat doesn't know. A lot of new viewers. Oh,
[8107.30s -> 8133.34s]  whatever. It's just cake Mario. All right. This guy's got to die. Get it. Get it. Die. What?
[8134.06s -> 8150.09s]  That hit him right in the back. How did I, how did I let it? I was going to say I ain't
[8150.09s -> 8174.39s]  fucking around anymore. Have I played Noita? Nope. I have not. Jesus. Oh, all right. Nine lives.
[8181.45s -> 8197.70s]  Play it right now. I'm about to beat this breakout game. You say Noita? How do you say it?
[8198.34s -> 8219.88s]  Noita? Noita? Noita? Shit. That was bad. All right. There can't be many more levels after this.
[8219.88s -> 8224.28s]  Hopefully I don't blow it. He's not going to ever, he's never going to play Noita.
[8226.02s -> 8237.51s]  Um, I don't know. We got a lot of stuff to do and I also have seven streams that are not video games.
[8240.54s -> 8259.59s]  That might be fun. That's right. You heard that right. Seven. Seven. Did you give up on FTK? No,
[8259.59s -> 8264.79s]  actually. I have a meeting with the people that made it because now I believe it is pretty close
[8264.79s -> 8271.99s]  to being really truly ready and that test that we did a few weeks back was very, very, very, very
[8271.99s -> 8281.32s]  helpful. Uh, yeah, I have like a meeting with those guys on, um, I think on Monday. You'll
[8281.32s -> 8296.41s]  hear more about that soon. They all unlock the puzzle card game. Oh, this is it. Oh man, that's
[8296.41s -> 8328.62s]  fast. I have five health? Oh, break the, I could break the cage. It's like playing air hockey. Get
[8328.62s -> 8376.84s]  up there. That's how you, that's the way you do it. Damn it. One more. Oh, oh, success losing against
[8376.84s -> 8385.83s]  CPU paddle. I'm fine. I got it. Damn, I got late, didn't it? Did I win? You saved the sacred child
[8385.83s -> 8399.85s]  of fire. Thank you. Save the remaining children and they will grant you with their power. That was
[8399.85s -> 8425.51s]  one. Wait, what? Talk to her in the town. Oh, demons could have used our magic to open a breach
[8425.51s -> 8446.94s]  to the nether world. That's one fourth of the game. Is it though? Where's the other, where the other
[8446.94s -> 8458.20s]  children? Are they hidden? They might be hidden in another level. I'm telling you, simple living is
[8458.20s -> 8472.04s]  the best lifestyle. He doesn't know. Go back to the nether world. Wait, what?
[8472.44s -> 8489.75s]  Oh, the 60 levels across the five worlds. Wait, so I have to find the way to get in.
[8490.87s -> 8513.51s]  Wait, didn't I go in this thing's mouth? I'm confused. Clear this level. Yeah, I'm going to
[8513.51s -> 8525.38s]  clear this level. Fuck, there's only five lives too. Shit, I'm in trouble. I should have bought
[8525.38s -> 8551.62s]  lives. That was a mistake. How the fuck did I miss all those? I'm so sad. Come on. But yeah, after
[8551.62s -> 8559.61s]  tomorrow. I'm not sure what we're doing after that. There's a ton of things on this list.
[8560.33s -> 8569.77s]  We'll just pick one. Got a lot of things to stream. All right, I don't want to get accidentally put
[8569.77s -> 8581.78s]  in there. Katana Zero. I'm going to play Katana Zero. Maybe that's what we'll do after playing
[8581.78s -> 8591.85s]  Keep Talking Nobody Explodes. Possible. Next day or the day after, whatever. It's on the list.
[8592.73s -> 8612.46s]  I would show you the list, but I don't want to spoil everything. Dude, I forgot that I played
[8612.46s -> 8621.29s]  that police game. That game was weird. I completely forgot about that game. That was like
[8621.29s -> 8653.77s]  yesterday in my brain. There it is. Is Pikmin on that list? It is not. It is not. Shit, it's not.
[8659.75s -> 8678.82s]  Yeah, it's not. Sorry. I just didn't put it on the list. Put it on. But which one? Pikmin 1,
[8678.82s -> 8683.38s]  Pikmin 2, Pikmin 3. Which one is the one that people think is good? They are all good.
[8684.66s -> 8701.70s]  1 and 2. Get them all. Mario Sunshine is on that list, though, so people can be happy about that
[8701.70s -> 8724.17s]  one. Just go in order. We could. How long are they? Are they long game? Not really. All right,
[8724.17s -> 8757.85s]  gotta be all blue. Or all whatever. All yellow. All red. All blue. All yellow. Oh my god. Yellow.
[8759.10s -> 8797.21s]  Yellow. I'm gonna beat the level before this happens. Blue. Red. Yellow. Red. All right. No.
[8798.68s -> 8819.43s]  Red. Red. Oh my god. This is fucking ridiculous. Finally. It was just for one heart.
[8819.51s -> 8837.78s]  There could be a crown in there. Have we still? All right, I get it. So you have to get them all
[8837.78s -> 8846.25s]  through different... All right. All of them are in here. Are we gonna get them all? I don't know.
[8846.25s -> 8855.54s]  I don't know if we're gonna get them all. Well, we're going up here. Oh, this will be interesting.
[8856.42s -> 8873.80s]  Three orbs. Double power. And catch them all. Let's go. It's just a shotgun that I get to catch.
[8875.43s -> 8881.43s]  Fuck! What? How? How? I'm done playing again. That just made me so sad. Like, that actually
[8881.43s -> 8888.84s]  made me so sad. I can't believe it. That's... I'm... That's actually ridiculous. I can't believe I
[8888.84s -> 8914.04s]  fucked that up. Is this gonna go down? I'm so... What the fuck? All right. I'm in trouble. If I die,
[8914.04s -> 8920.44s]  I'm a... If I die, it was a cute game. This is a really cute game. I'm done with it if it's cute.
[8921.16s -> 8927.88s]  If it's... If it's a cute game, I'm done with it. It wants... All right. I'm... Okay. I actually am
[8927.88s -> 8933.45s]  like fucking starting to freak out. I just want... I just want a pizza. No. All right. I'm not gonna
[8933.45s -> 8938.73s]  be able to... Who cares? It's... This heart's in here. Don't even get the chest. What is going on
[8938.73s -> 8945.21s]  right now, guys? What's going on? What am I doing? I just... I'm like throwing. I'm not even trying
[8945.21s -> 8988.18s]  to throw. I swear to God. Motherfucker. Yellow. All right. Bart. Bart. Bart. Your mind says game,
[8988.18s -> 9002.92s]  but your heart says pizza. Or like maybe like tacos or something. A good... A good nice like
[9003.56s -> 9008.36s]  soft shell, you know what I mean? Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking
[9008.36s -> 9032.14s]  about. Get up there. All right. Pull together here, seriously. Before I lose... Well, I got one child,
[9032.14s -> 9041.13s]  right? So that's all right. Look, I need to get the four children of power. All right. Well,
[9041.13s -> 9046.09s]  with this, I'll be able to at least turn on... Our TV's at least will work, right?
[9067.22s -> 9089.42s]  His brain is mush. Oh my God. I was looking at chat. All right. Yeah. All right. Okay. There it is.
[9089.42s -> 9096.22s]  All right. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yep. Yep. This game's actually really fun, though.
[9096.86s -> 9115.05s]  I like this game. He's done? No, I'm... Not yet. I'll get to one more boss. He said the same thing
[9115.05s -> 9122.41s]  about Jump King. Yeah, but Jump King was... So you guys don't know this, but like two days ago,
[9122.41s -> 9129.85s]  I had this extreme urge to play the DLC. I was like, I want to play Jump King DLC right now.
[9130.65s -> 9136.28s]  And then I stopped myself. I don't want to do that. That does not sound like a good idea.
[9141.62s -> 9157.29s]  All right. This is it. No losing here. Get it up top. Nice. Good. Again. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[9157.29s -> 9165.62s]  Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. That's just exactly what I wanted to have happen.
[9170.46s -> 9183.85s]  So there are two Jump King DLCs. I'm dead. No, we're good. We're good. I can do it again.
[9184.49s -> 9206.95s]  The second one on average is between 25 and 40 hours. Yeah, I know. I've seen a lot of the clips
[9207.91s -> 9216.25s]  of streamers and bawling. And I'm just like, that's probably going to be me. And
[9219.26s -> 9227.32s]  it's just like, damn, that's a lot. Some of these people handle that shit way better than I would.
[9240.81s -> 9259.29s]  Seriously. It takes an average of like 20 to 40 hours. Maybe. We'll see. I really know what's
[9259.29s -> 9264.36s]  going to happen. I said this to myself. I'm going to open it. I'm going to be really into it. Yeah,
[9264.36s -> 9268.87s]  let's go into the DLC. I'm going to get into it. I'm going to beat it. And after like two or three
[9268.87s -> 9273.27s]  hours, I'm going to be sitting there and you guys won't even hear about this. It'll be me internally
[9273.27s -> 9280.23s]  saying to myself, not out loud, just going fucking mistake. This was, I could have fucking played
[9280.23s -> 9284.23s]  Nancy Drew or anything. I could have played fucking no more heroes or something, but now I'm here.
[9285.82s -> 9303.51s]  Fucking idiot. Stupid fucking goddamn idiot. And now I can't leave. I will be internalizing that.
[9311.72s -> 9326.82s]  Get him. How is it not getting him? Jump in real life instead.
[9328.06s -> 9342.04s]  That would be interesting, wouldn't it? Play this game if you're a streamer or a YouTuber.
[9343.88s -> 9351.66s]  I'm just happy that I beat it. And I, look, if I never beat it again, if I never do anything,
[9351.66s -> 9360.10s]  but I did the base game and I'm like, okay. But if you start the DLC, you are accepting
[9362.68s -> 9369.93s]  the fact that you have to try to finish it. You don't start the Jump King DLC and go, man,
[9369.93s -> 9375.77s]  all right, it's the Jump King DLC. It's been an hour. No, I'm out. I'm not doing that. It's like,
[9375.77s -> 9389.82s]  you've no, you have to get, you have to stay there. You did it. You did that. Oh, I didn't.
[9389.82s -> 9417.50s]  When did I do that? Oh, you tried out both DLC. Yeah. But that was before even one of those times
[9417.50s -> 9421.18s]  is I just stumbled upon it accidentally. I thought it was another area in the game. I didn't know it
[9421.18s -> 9428.34s]  was a DLC. Yeah, of course. But I wanted to see what it looked like. I didn't start playing the
[9428.34s -> 9450.98s]  DLC. I just wanted to see what it looked like. Oh, you started it. I didn't even start it.
[9459.66s -> 9467.50s]  I did. Yeah, I did one screen. I'm playing a game that's relaxing. That's not Jump King.
[9475.85s -> 9482.73s]  The stream has been kind of interesting. This was like, I was that that emergency game was
[9482.73s -> 9496.55s]  crazy. And now I'm just like mouth open. It's pretty rare. We don't want you to relax. We
[9496.55s -> 9506.09s]  want you to play Jump King. Don't relax. Stop relaxing. Fine. Fine. I'll open it.
[9507.29s -> 9521.96s]  I'm not going to beat it. I'm going to. No, no, don't let them get to you. Don't let them feed on your
[9523.16s -> 9539.05s]  vices and your insecurities. Don't let them. I don't want to open it. I'm not going to beat it
[9539.05s -> 9546.60s]  tonight. I've been streaming for six hours. I'm not going to beat Jump King DLC tonight.
[9547.16s -> 9552.94s]  You guys just told me it takes like 50 hours to beat this thing. I'm not going to beat it now.
[9554.14s -> 9570.02s]  Me and Joel are planning to keep talking. Nobody explodes tomorrow. I'm going to play it right now.
