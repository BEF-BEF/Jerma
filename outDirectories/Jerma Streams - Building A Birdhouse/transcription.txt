[1.08s -> 15.03s]  Hey, sorry I'm late. I had a couple things I had to do that I wasn't aware of until like 45 minutes
[15.03s -> 30.73s]  ago. Let me just get a tweet out there. Hey, a tweet? What a coincidence. Tweeting out a birdhouse
[30.73s -> 38.12s]  stream. I mean, there's something funny there, I think. Rvem just gave out five community subs.
[38.76s -> 47.54s]  Thank you so much, Rvem. Right off the bat. Didn't even get started yet. I'm making a gaming bird...
[47.54s -> 52.10s]  Like, this is going to be the worst stream you've ever watched. Hold on. Let me just...
[52.10s -> 87.43s]  I'll be right back. Give me one second. Okay, so yes, tonight is more proof that all you need
[87.43s -> 95.32s]  to do is just kind of just be the one guy sometimes. Maybe like five or four or five days
[95.32s -> 104.82s]  ago, somebody in the recommended channel just wrote, build a gamer birdhouse. And I was like,
[106.34s -> 115.24s]  that's really dumb. And then I bought a birdhouse kit. And that's where we are right
[115.24s -> 124.62s]  here. That's what we're doing now. One guy. More proof that eventually, if you stick around
[124.62s -> 134.50s]  long enough, you probably be the one guy. And I was thinking about it as I was unpacking
[134.50s -> 142.10s]  this thing and just looking at it and taking a look at the directions. This is going to be
[142.10s -> 149.05s]  really bad. This is going to be bad. I just want to make sure right off the bat,
[149.05s -> 153.88s]  your expectations are very low. Okay. We're talking like, think about where you could put
[153.88s -> 162.22s]  your expectations. Like a scale of a 10 point scale. Okay. One is... Oh, let's get like
[162.86s -> 171.42s]  this off the screen here. So expectation one at a 10 point scale is a guy turns on a live stream
[172.30s -> 179.67s]  and he's asleep with a black screen, right? It's tiny. What do you mean it's tiny?
[185.13s -> 190.17s]  SheXOXO, thanks for the five community subs. Oh, and I'm already dropping stuff. That's super
[190.17s -> 196.25s]  glue. Don't want to get, don't want to get that on your lips. Hey, here's like the funny
[196.25s -> 200.25s]  joke for today. I'm going to pretend that this is chapstick at some point. I'm going to
[200.25s -> 204.73s]  put super glue on my lips and I'm going to go and then everyone's going to laugh.
[208.10s -> 215.43s]  Ripped shirt? No, it's old. This is like a shirt from 1981. Is it ripped shirt or is he
[215.43s -> 221.03s]  wearing a choker? No, this is a ripped shirt. I'm not wearing a fucking choker.
[234.87s -> 249.62s]  Anyways, let me just get a sip of my delicious fucking tea. Oh, my tooth. That's
[249.62s -> 254.58s]  good tea. All right, my train of thought. Thank you to the five community subs. Thanks for coming
[254.58s -> 259.78s]  out. And so here's what we're talking about here. So if you talk about a point scale for
[259.78s -> 266.10s]  for streams, one is guy turns on stream, black screen, sleeping, you just hear him snoring
[266.10s -> 270.10s]  and that stream is on for 12 hours. Nothing changes. It's just black screen, guy snoring.
[270.82s -> 277.06s]  A two would be cam on guys sleeping and snoring, not just black screen.
[278.20s -> 288.36s]  A three is this stream. That's what you're about to watch. You're about to watch a
[288.36s -> 295.82s]  tier above the guy sleeping with the webcam on. Let's see what we even got in here. We
[295.82s -> 301.62s]  have to work with this like nails in here. So I got to be actually careful that I got this.
[301.62s -> 309.08s]  I could get hurt. Somebody just broke joke incoming. This is the joke. This is it. Like
[309.08s -> 314.04s]  somebody told somebody to build this on stream. It's gonna be so loud. This fucking
[314.04s -> 318.44s]  hammer is going to make like loud noises. The neighbors are going to fucking hear me.
[319.16s -> 331.80s]  So let's take a look at the pieces we've got in our fucking bird house.
[331.80s -> 338.25s]  No, it's too early for that. So this little, this little guy right here,
[338.25s -> 342.41s]  that's what the bird sits on when he's outside, outside of his house.
[343.90s -> 354.26s]  Let's go over the pieces. So we've got front door, back door. I don't know what these
[354.26s -> 366.92s]  are. Side panels. Okay. Well, this has like a, why is this like a tombstone?
[366.92s -> 375.67s]  This is like a bird tombstone. Okay. This looks like the floor. Where's the roof?
[377.35s -> 384.31s]  Where's the actual roof to this thing? And I got, and paint. It came with four paints.
[384.87s -> 388.63s]  So I hope you're ready to paint this because you only get to choose between yellow,
[388.63s -> 397.08s]  white, red, or blue. So is this the roof? This comes with instructions,
[397.08s -> 399.56s]  but should I try to build it without the instructions? Maybe that would be
[400.68s -> 406.74s]  more fun. I don't think fun, I don't think fun is the right word. Without the instructions,
[406.74s -> 410.34s]  but I don't know how I'm going to do this. I need the instructions. I need the glue.
[410.90s -> 422.95s]  All right. No, no instructions. I can fucking do this. All right. So here we go. So it's
[422.95s -> 425.27s]  going to look, let's, let's just, let's block it out. So we make sure we know what
[425.27s -> 435.03s]  we're doing here. Like this, right? This is a fucking small bird house. What bird is going
[435.03s -> 447.46s]  to fit in here? No bird's going to fit in this. By the way, I don't think there are any birds
[447.46s -> 458.65s]  in Las Vegas. I don't think there are birds here. All right. Let's go. I don't, I'm
[458.65s -> 463.93s]  using the fucking instructional manual. All right. Sort the pieces, find the hammer,
[463.93s -> 480.55s]  ask an adult if you need to find a hammer. Are they labeled? Don't use it. Fine. Here you go.
[482.33s -> 511.85s]  Okay. This is, this is the, this is, this is the top. This is the roof because look,
[511.85s -> 515.21s]  it has to go like that, right? Cause there's, there's that like chain that comes over.
[515.21s -> 524.87s]  So this has to be the roof because there's a chain in here. So this is the floor.
[526.60s -> 533.58s]  Is that the floor? I don't think that's the floor. I think this is the floor
[533.58s -> 549.85s]  because then, ah, look at that. You guys didn't think I was going to figure it out.
[549.85s -> 558.71s]  Well, this is the floor right here. Here's the floor. How do I, I have to like hammer
[558.71s -> 566.68s]  the nails in here. But which way do those go? So that's the floor. Here are the side panels
[577.40s -> 583.48s]  like that. That's not the, what about the sides? Are these the sides?
[589.82s -> 597.45s]  Give me the instruction. I don't care. What did I get? I crumpled them all up.
[597.45s -> 600.97s]  Let me just get the, let me just get the base first and then we can, who cares?
[604.74s -> 611.59s]  These are the side walls. How the fuck are these the side walls? I had it right. So how, what?
[616.09s -> 624.44s]  So this is the roof. So that's, that's the floor. I had it right the first time.
[624.44s -> 631.02s]  How are these, how are these the walls? Those are walls. Look at this from this angle.
[632.98s -> 642.22s]  This is, that's not a fucking wall. That's very clearly not going to help.
[644.78s -> 659.43s]  They go on top of the wood. Okay. Wait, what am I doing? I'm doing the first two steps.
[661.22s -> 671.85s]  The floor. What do you mean the floor? Do you like to have them like that?
[679.70s -> 694.89s]  There we go. I have to glue this shit on top of the floor. Wait,
[694.89s -> 707.26s]  I'm going to stop reading this chat room. Okay. Just let me, let me just read this.
[707.26s -> 713.94s]  Select perch B and house front C, which is this these two. Okay. I'm doing it one at a
[713.94s -> 718.10s]  time place. I can't do it. If I do it in the wrong order, I'm not going to be able to get
[718.10s -> 721.14s]  it right. And then the, and then the no birds that are in Las Vegas, they're not going to
[721.14s -> 728.17s]  enjoy this. I need a small amount of glue on end of perch and insert small. All right. So
[728.17s -> 735.06s]  I got to glue this thing on. Just, just relax. See, it's got to go right there.
[735.06s -> 741.08s]  I don't even need glue. No birds are going to enjoy this. They'll be, they'll be fine.
[742.71s -> 745.75s]  So this is the glue. I can't, I'm not going to fucking be stupid. I'm not going to eat
[745.75s -> 752.22s]  this. Although it all, it is tempting though. Frosting, frosting. It's like frosting. It's
[752.22s -> 760.46s]  not frosting, Jeremy. Okay. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Okay. Whoa. Okay. So this is glue.
[760.46s -> 765.50s]  What kind of glue is this? Oh, that comes up fucking fast. You guys want a good shot of the
[765.50s -> 790.71s]  glue going on? Perfect amount of glue. Look at that. See? And then that goes in here
[795.88s -> 802.15s]  like this. I don't want to see the glues go out around the edges though. I already
[802.15s -> 806.98s]  fucked it up. It's already ruined. Look it. It's already ruined. Already I fucked it up.
[806.98s -> 814.76s]  It's already fucked up. I already ruined it. I already fucking ruined it. See? No, don't.
[815.40s -> 822.01s]  Whatever. Who fucking cares? Okay. Done. Let's take a look at what the next step is.
[824.33s -> 845.86s]  Place floor on flat surface. This is the floor. What? Like this. Just wipe it. No,
[845.86s -> 850.62s]  I'm not going to wipe it. Once, okay, I will stop after this and I'll throw the
[850.62s -> 855.58s]  directions behind me in a fucking fit of rage and you'll think, you'll think it's cute, right?
[857.50s -> 861.66s]  Okay. On the inside bottom edge, I got to run glue down here and then glue it
[863.82s -> 874.60s]  to here like this. So we've got glue again. Oh, fuck. I need like four people for this.
[887.78s -> 946.76s]  Okay. So like this and then I have to hammer this in. What happened? Ask your mother for
[946.76s -> 956.86s]  help. I'm going to have like sticky fucking hands. Look at the instructions again. That is the
[956.86s -> 974.25s]  floor. Place floor on flat surface. That's what I did. Take the front. Place against floor edge,
[974.25s -> 985.51s]  matching up nail holes. Don't you understand? I had it done right. Like I did that right.
[985.51s -> 995.37s]  Like this. That was correct. Why is everybody freaking out? That's what I was supposed to
[995.37s -> 1005.56s]  do. Because see, look. See? See the holes there? Like something else has to go in there.
[1006.12s -> 1016.23s]  Because this is the floor. On top? What do you mean on top? Like this? How am I supposed to
[1016.23s -> 1029.43s]  hammer this in? How am I supposed to hammer this in? I can hammer it in this way. Why do
[1029.43s -> 1044.09s]  I even need to put the glue there? Just fucking hammer it in. God damn it. Now I don't know
[1044.09s -> 1058.22s]  where the holes are. He's pretending. Yeah. Yeah. Got you. All right. So then like this
[1058.22s -> 1069.82s]  and then the nails. Look at that. All right. All right. I don't want a bird to go in this.
[1069.82s -> 1076.20s]  They're gonna, they're gonna like die from like the glue poisoning. Okay. We're gonna hold it
[1076.20s -> 1087.59s]  there for 10 seconds. All right. Now I need to hammer the nails in. How am I gonna do that
[1087.59s -> 1097.62s]  though? Is it? Oh, what? Disgusting. There's a fucking worm in my fucking drink. Don't step on
[1097.62s -> 1111.99s]  those. You didn't. Whatever. Don't step on that. Watch it. Hey. Watch it. This is fucking
[1111.99s -> 1143.75s]  dangerous now. Watch it. I don't think this is possible. All right. I got an idea. What?
[1143.75s -> 1154.31s]  Okay. So if I just like make it land on the spikes, I'm gonna put a nail through my hand
[1154.31s -> 1162.71s]  on this stream. I'm taking my fucking time, man. All right. Here we go. Ready?
[1162.71s -> 1194.39s]  You gotta put. All right. It's in. Now I gotta get the other one. Oh, look. Like coddled,
[1194.39s -> 1201.58s]  soft hands man. Scared by, scared by fucking hammer and nail. Oh, well,
[1202.30s -> 1214.98s]  I don't touch those things. That's it, right? That's going in. Let's get it in one hit.
[1216.62s -> 1221.70s]  Oh no, don't do that. This is dangerous and you could be, you could get hurt. Don't fucking try
[1221.70s -> 1226.71s]  this at home. Uh, yeah. Don't build a bird house at home. That's, they're fucking dangerous guys.
[1226.71s -> 1245.96s]  Pretty sick. All right. That's good. It's in there. It ain't going anywhere. Nice. All right.
[1246.76s -> 1250.04s]  Now we're on the right track. Now I don't need, I don't, I, I know this is the back.
[1250.60s -> 1258.92s]  So that's going here. How loud? That's probably really fucking loud. Table dented. Where?
[1260.65s -> 1277.37s]  Right there. Where's the table dented? Right there. Right here. Stop. This table is.
[1278.89s -> 1286.20s]  All right. Listen to me. This table has seen a lot of work. I've built every labo on these
[1286.20s -> 1292.60s]  tables. Uh, that's a lie, but some of them, this was thrown in as a last second in the
[1292.60s -> 1298.04s]  moving truck because it was just a random shitty table that I still had that my mother
[1298.04s -> 1304.36s]  gave me like 10 years ago. So look, it's going to be fine. Don't worry. This is not
[1304.36s -> 1309.00s]  expensive table. This table was like probably four and a half dollars 12 years ago, 20 years ago.
[1310.06s -> 1315.34s]  It's an heirloom. No, it's tested. Look, it's tested with the test of time and it can take
[1315.34s -> 1321.64s]  anything I want. This is my like fuck you table. You know what I mean? Like build a
[1321.64s -> 1339.34s]  bird house and paint on it. All right. We guys relax. How are these? Wait a minute.
[1339.34s -> 1358.36s]  Look at how small that is. A bird can't fit in here. This is a wall. If I were a bird,
[1358.36s -> 1365.27s]  I would throw up in here. I'd get claustrophobic inside of this place. All right. Where are the
[1365.27s -> 1374.28s]  holes here? There's a hole here. So these two holes are designed to go in. There's holes on
[1374.28s -> 1384.20s]  the edges here. So that's like this. Okay. So they'll have to connect that. Let's glue it
[1384.28s -> 1410.07s]  first. I don't understand what the glue is for if you have nails. Okay. The wasps are going
[1410.07s -> 1421.30s]  to appreciate this nest. I'm done. I'm done using the glue. Look, okay. Here's the glue
[1421.30s -> 1424.50s]  will be the icing on our, it's going to be like a gingerbread house. I'll just put like
[1424.50s -> 1430.95s]  icing swirls on it. Fuck this shit. Get this out of here. Don't do, don't get that on the
[1430.95s -> 1439.90s]  nice desk. Don't put that over here. Don't fuck up this desk. I don't care about this
[1439.90s -> 1443.74s]  one. This one, they might look the same guys, but they are not the same. They are very much
[1443.74s -> 1449.58s]  not the same desk. I'm so paranoid. I dumped a whole coffee on here the other day. All
[1449.58s -> 1461.88s]  right. That was enough time to load it in. Is this shit blurry? Is this blurry? No, you're
[1461.88s -> 1471.50s]  good. Basically the same desk. No, it's not the same desk. Well, I'm just realizing
[1471.50s -> 1476.58s]  right now where the web with the face cam is. This looks like I'm like fucking huge.
[1476.58s -> 1481.85s]  I got like a tiny head and a huge fucking arms. Yeah, this looks easy enough for me.
[1482.57s -> 1489.70s]  It's like a mech suit, the body type of a fucking Megazoid.
[1499.72s -> 1523.37s]  All right. Uh, nail right in the front, right? Right there. Huh? I'm not using
[1523.37s -> 1528.81s]  glue anymore. There's no reason to do it. It doesn't do anything. It doesn't fucking do
[1528.81s -> 1538.65s]  anything. I have to hold this and hammer the nail in. I should have put these on
[1538.65s -> 1596.33s]  first. Why did I not do the walls first? Fucking gamer bird house. How can I think
[1596.41s -> 1603.90s]  of this with physics, right? Cause you know, cause phonetically speaking, I have to
[1603.90s -> 1609.03s]  connect these two together, but the, the centrifugal force of the glue is not
[1609.03s -> 1617.78s]  holding it. So it falls off. So I gotta go like that. Oh yeah. I got it. I got
[1617.78s -> 1622.17s]  it right. Fucking here. That lined up right? Yeah. Fucking just squeeze it.
[1644.41s -> 1656.12s]  Just get it. Here we go. Now it's in. Now it's in. Just get it in there. Got it.
[1659.50s -> 1691.56s]  Hmm. No, there's a fucking little gap. There's no gap anymore. Get over there.
[1691.56s -> 1732.04s]  Mother fuck. Am I hitting this into cement or I don't understand. I'm going
[1732.04s -> 1749.58s]  to break it. I'm going to break it. It's in. No, it's in. It's in. Oh,
[1757.37s -> 1772.94s]  look at how red I am. We'll come back to that later. I got to get the other
[1772.94s -> 1777.10s]  one in. No, how am I supposed to do this? How are you supposed to
[1777.10s -> 1790.90s]  actually do this? I gotta think of what color I want to paint my bird house.
[1790.90s -> 1800.62s]  Oh my fucking God. And now it's like bent. The nail is bent. I bent the
[1800.62s -> 1807.78s]  fucking nail. No. All right. It's an extra perch for the bird. You know
[1807.78s -> 1814.63s]  what I mean? The bird, one daddy bird can go here, right? And then baby bird
[1814.63s -> 1823.88s]  can go here. And then baby bird too can go over here. I'm like knocking
[1823.88s -> 1831.85s]  out other nails. There's no pulling this out. I'm already committed. I've
[1831.85s -> 1836.60s]  got to just really get this in. This, I've become too completely
[1836.60s -> 1839.96s]  committed. But how? I'm gonna need something to wedge this up against
[1839.96s -> 1842.20s]  like a wall or something. I'm gonna like push it against, no, but I can't
[1842.20s -> 1849.93s]  like, I'm gonna put a hole in the wall. Use the side of the table.
[1849.93s -> 1868.92s]  Yeah, but look at it. It's all wiggly. I think that was a glue on my hand.
[1868.92s -> 1880.94s]  No, that wasn't. I'm just panicking for no reason. Okay.
[1880.94s -> 1883.66s]  All right. What's next on this? It's not even written. All right. So now I
[1883.66s -> 1890.95s]  gotta put the other wall. No, I gotta put the other nail in.
[1890.95s -> 1893.59s]  God, this is, are we having fun yet? You know what I mean? We haven't
[1893.59s -> 1907.02s]  fun yet on this stream. No. No. No. Hey, fucking one guy
[1907.02s -> 1911.37s]  wanted to do this. Do you understand? That's what we're doing this for.
[1911.37s -> 1923.64s]  One fucking guy said, hold on. All right. That wall's on. This feels a little
[1923.64s -> 1928.98s]  not secure at all though. All right. You know when you're sitting at a
[1928.98s -> 1933.02s]  dinner table and if you put your elbow on it goes
[1933.02s -> 1936.14s]  and then you have to spend the entire evening trying to not put
[1936.14s -> 1938.94s]  enough pressure on the table so you don't knock everybody's food
[1938.94s -> 1943.06s]  around and knock everybody's drinks off and shit.
[1943.06s -> 1946.26s]  I hate that, man. That's the absolute worst. You know, don't you like hate
[1946.26s -> 1948.42s]  like fucking weird shit like that? Do you just hate stuff like that, guys?
[1948.42s -> 1962.90s]  Relatable. All right. Now other wall. I don't even know if I'm going to get
[1962.90s -> 1965.98s]  this correct. It's gonna be, this is gonna be so
[1965.98s -> 1973.40s]  fucked up. So then this goes, I need it. I need, I don't, the glue is not
[1973.40s -> 1976.12s]  gonna, is not doing it for me. Forget about the glue. That's the
[1976.12s -> 1978.52s]  decoration on top. I dropped nails on the ground.
[1978.52s -> 1983.74s]  Don't, let me forget those. That'll go through my foot in like three
[1983.74s -> 1992.65s]  days. Don't forget those. Don't forget them.
[1992.65s -> 2002.25s]  This birdhouse is like such a simple stupid little shit birdhouse.
[2002.25s -> 2005.53s]  Yeah, what's the point of the glue? It's just there to make
[2005.53s -> 2010.65s]  like little, little Timmy think he's like working on something.
[2010.65s -> 2013.69s]  Because you bet your ass that's why that's there.
[2013.69s -> 2018.57s]  You think them parents are gonna let little Timmy pick up the hammer and
[2018.57s -> 2023.27s]  fucking hammer this thing? No. That's what dad's for. That's what
[2023.27s -> 2027.94s]  I'm for. You know what I mean? Oh, it's gonna go on the bottom one
[2027.94s -> 2042.02s]  first. Get that in there. Okay, same deal as last time. I
[2042.02s -> 2044.10s]  gotta, I gotta be careful because it's
[2044.26s -> 2048.63s]  it's not flush. If it's not flush here, that means it's not gonna be flush up
[2048.63s -> 2062.10s]  top either though. Fuck you, come on. Get over here. Like this.
[2062.10s -> 2071.08s]  Get on the edge of the table. Get on there. This doesn't feel right.
[2071.08s -> 2087.26s]  I don't know what that was. I'm sorry. All right, we're almost done with the
[2087.26s -> 2089.66s]  construction. Actually, no we're not. We have a lot of other shit to do
[2089.66s -> 2094.74s]  with it. That was cool. I love those muscular
[2094.74s -> 2101.93s]  items. Hey, thanks. All right, one. Don't, every time I put my thumb
[2101.93s -> 2106.17s]  here. Okay, I'm gonna like, I'm gonna line it up real quick.
[2106.17s -> 2109.69s]  That's how, that's cartoon goofy from fucking the Disney channel. That's how
[2109.69s -> 2129.14s]  he like hurts his hand every episode. Oh, didn't go in. Uh-oh.
[2129.14s -> 2135.99s]  No, we're good. Oh, maybe not. I think I may have actually
[2135.99s -> 2144.07s]  broke it. No, I didn't. We're fine. All right, come on. Don't, don't goofy
[2144.07s -> 2148.68s]  this. Do not goofy this. It's in the perfect spot to get
[2148.68s -> 2153.08s]  goofy and I don't want to do that. So we're gonna be very gentle, very
[2153.08s -> 2167.58s]  careful. Okay, now I can move the thumb.
[2167.58s -> 2186.12s]  It's going like this. Whatever, I don't have to fucking live here.
[2186.12s -> 2195.08s]  So then hammer it in there. Almost got, it's almost complete.
[2195.08s -> 2198.20s]  I can't, this is, it's almost complete for us to go to the top and
[2198.20s -> 2202.18s]  just baseball throw it down into the ground and watch it explode.
[2202.18s -> 2213.26s]  We're not doing that, I'm kidding. Jesus, he's not very smart, is he?
[2213.26s -> 2217.42s]  It's a fucking birdhouse. These things, do you think, do you think, do you
[2217.42s -> 2220.38s]  think that, do you think that these things are cut correctly?
[2220.38s -> 2223.66s]  No, they mass produce 500 fucking million of these
[2223.66s -> 2227.66s]  and they're all at random specs. They're not cut correctly. They're not all cut
[2227.66s -> 2236.58s]  correctly. They, yes they are. It says who?
[2236.58s -> 2247.11s]  Do you work at Birdhouse Factory for? It's just, it's just some credentials.
[2247.11s -> 2252.33s]  Oh, you see, I work at the Birdhouse Factory. They're all cut to spec.
[2252.33s -> 2259.78s]  They're in any room for error in my Birdhouse Factory.
[2259.78s -> 2266.33s]  How is this gonna stay down here? No, I gotta go through them. No, I have
[2266.33s -> 2268.97s]  to go through this one first. I can't go through the bottom
[2268.97s -> 2277.42s]  because I have to connect it first. Yeah, all right, what side of the
[2277.42s -> 2281.22s]  Birdhouse Factory did you guys wake up on today?
[2281.22s -> 2303.69s]  Fuck! No, it's all right. I thought it was really wrong.
[2303.69s -> 2310.66s]  Mmm, that's moving a lot. I don't like how that's moving around so much.
[2310.66s -> 2316.92s]  These pieces of wood are near flawless for a quarter of a penny.
[2316.92s -> 2322.73s]  Really? Didn't that sell? Did that sell?
[2322.73s -> 2347.58s]  He's the same piece. Would you look at that.
[2347.58s -> 2355.32s]  Oh, would you, would you look at this? That's not exact, is it?
[2355.32s -> 2359.29s]  Oh, listen, it's a little, what happened here?
[2359.29s -> 2385.10s]  What happened there? Factory? Hmm? What happened here?
[2385.10s -> 2388.54s]  Yeah, get fucking, get the Birdhouse Factory exposed.
[2388.54s -> 2398.10s]  I don't even know where these, where were these plugged in? I don't know.
[2398.10s -> 2402.82s]  I gotta move this way though. I'm stuck over here. Not in the
[2402.82s -> 2406.87s]  Birdhouse. I'm talking about in, in this life.
[2406.87s -> 2412.02s]  There we go, all right. Of course, Mickey!
[2412.02s -> 2433.80s]  Whoa! Almost did it, Mickey! Don't fucking do this at your house.
[2433.80s -> 2466.38s]  It didn't do anything. Fuck! It's still, the Pinocchio nose is in the
[2466.38s -> 2468.38s]  front. That's why it makes it impossible to do this.
[2468.38s -> 2484.60s]  And the leg. Oh, I just broke the table! Table broken up!
[2484.60s -> 2510.10s]  All right, looking pretty good. I'm gonna do the outside first.
[2510.10s -> 2512.42s]  I don't know why anybody else feels like this when you're working with
[2512.42s -> 2516.92s]  tools, especially with wood and nails. So, this is getting very tight
[2516.92s -> 2521.54s]  right now. To a point where I, it's like, oh, I gotta pull it and then
[2521.54s -> 2524.02s]  hammer it in. Don't you feel like that the wood's gonna explode?
[2524.02s -> 2527.77s]  But isn't that, can't that happen? Can't there be like enough pressure
[2527.77s -> 2530.73s]  being pulling and pushing and crack, crack, crack, that the thing just
[2530.73s -> 2535.98s]  blows the fuck up? I don't want that to happen, so I'm
[2535.98s -> 2558.17s]  being very careful. This thing's gonna explode. All right,
[2558.17s -> 2564.50s]  I'm missing a nail somewhere, right? Thank you for reminding me about the
[2564.50s -> 2573.38s]  nail on the floor. Okay, they're still gonna put the
[2573.38s -> 2581.06s]  roof on. Oh, shit! There's already a bird in here!
[2581.14s -> 2600.23s]  He like, found his way in! How does this even, I'm really fucking
[2600.23s -> 2611.94s]  reaching here, huh? You can see it better that way, right?
[2611.94s -> 2621.18s]  Oh yeah, I'm very proud of myself right now. This is an accomplishment.
[2621.18s -> 2631.26s]  You know what I mean? I'm gonna go to sleep tonight and I'm gonna be going,
[2631.26s -> 2635.10s]  just having a couple of nightmares, like fucking nightmares, like Jason
[2635.10s -> 2639.10s]  the chainsaw, like chainsawing me! And then I'm gonna scream, wake up, and
[2639.10s -> 2641.74s]  like go back to bed. And then I'm gonna have like a pretty decent
[2641.74s -> 2655.42s]  dream about like birds and, you know, I built that. That was fun.
[2655.42s -> 2660.07s]  I don't think that's in. It is actually. All right, the general construction is
[2660.07s -> 2665.21s]  complete. No, it's not. Not yet.
[2665.21s -> 2671.35s]  Are you stressed out? No, I'm just kidding.
[2671.35s -> 2691.69s]  Bird lands and the bottom fall. Yeah, all right, so we make like a bird
[2691.69s -> 2696.25s]  trap door. The bird lands and like falls out.
[2696.25s -> 2699.61s]  And then I'll build a bigger, better house, right?
[2699.61s -> 2702.73s]  Connected. It's an, and this thing has cushions and it's got like
[2702.73s -> 2706.09s]  cable tv and it's five times as big and they go into that one. And then
[2706.09s -> 2709.45s]  this is just kind of the entrance. So then the people don't know
[2709.45s -> 2713.37s]  what the bird has. I mean, this is like the fake house. Like I just have like
[2713.37s -> 2716.33s]  four walls and a fucking front door, but they don't know. Like they come
[2716.33s -> 2718.73s]  down, the trap door goes whoop, they fall through,
[2718.73s -> 2723.46s]  and then there's another exit out the back of the tree. So
[2723.46s -> 2737.51s]  they can have as many nuts in there as they want. Bird tax evasion.
[2737.51s -> 2747.56s]  I did it. Now I'm just gonna put these two on. Now how the fuck does
[2747.56s -> 2764.17s]  this work? Because this little, little slot here,
[2764.17s -> 2769.62s]  so it goes like this. Oh wait, hold on, I see.
[2769.62s -> 2776.54s]  I get it. Do I? Yeah, because the chain goes through there,
[2776.54s -> 2782.90s]  because this goes like that, because there's the slots on top.
[2782.90s -> 2786.66s]  You should really pull your pants up. I'm wearing pants today.
[2786.66s -> 2791.98s]  I had to. Fuck, no, it goes like this.
[2791.98s -> 2800.73s]  Because then the chain goes, how the fuck does this work? It goes
[2800.73s -> 2804.86s]  like that. How does the chain go in here? The
[2804.86s -> 2814.65s]  chain has to go up and through there. Like that, because the divot, I don't
[2814.65s -> 2823.58s]  know if you guys can see. I'm pretty sure it has to go like
[2823.58s -> 2832.33s]  this. I have no fucking idea, because the
[2832.33s -> 2836.94s]  chain has to go through. The chain, see, the chain has to go through. So
[2836.94s -> 2841.32s]  you know, it's like that. Got it. Bingo. But this might have to have to
[2841.32s -> 2847.69s]  turn around like this, because the chain goes. No, no, I had it
[2847.69s -> 2853.94s]  right. Bingo. Okay, so like that. So this
[2853.94s -> 2864.25s]  one's gonna go on first. Oh shit. What? How the fuck does this go on? There's no
[2864.25s -> 2870.44s]  holes here. I don't have a guide. I don't have any hole guide.
[2870.44s -> 2882.73s]  The holes are on the top. I think that's how,
[2882.73s -> 2885.05s]  I think this is how it goes, and I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna deal with
[2885.05s -> 2894.68s]  it. I think. Don't get angry,
[2894.68s -> 2902.78s]  because there's no, the only holes are on the top here. Nail it with the
[2902.78s -> 2937.93s]  chain already attached. My neck is too thick for this. Somebody
[2937.93s -> 2952.38s]  mentioned choker earlier. You can like see this digging into my
[2952.38s -> 2959.32s]  skin. Hey, uh, what's up? Do you like my new look?
[2959.32s -> 2966.09s]  It's just like digging into my body. Yeah, I'm gonna do like accessories now.
[2966.09s -> 2972.84s]  What do you think? Now here's the worst part about this. I
[2972.84s -> 3001.35s]  might not be able to get this off. See, it didn't even leave a mark, but
[3001.35s -> 3005.58s]  very clearly it did. It's like, it's like a fucking red
[3005.58s -> 3012.52s]  line. My like neck just drank kool-aid.
[3012.52s -> 3017.21s]  Whatever. How do I do this? I'm about to go get
[3017.21s -> 3031.58s]  alcohol. I don't, I'm done. I don't care. I was hanging. Look, wouldn't it be better?
[3031.58s -> 3034.79s]  Okay, listen, hear me out. Hear me out, guys.
[3034.79s -> 3039.51s]  Just wait. Don't you think it would be better if I put like water in here
[3039.51s -> 3045.02s]  and it looks like a bird hot tub? You know, like a bird bath.
[3045.02s -> 3047.98s]  Look at how perfect this is. They come in here, they could put their
[3047.98s -> 3050.86s]  towel over there, they go right through, they could be in the water,
[3050.86s -> 3054.78s]  bird bath, take a bath, come out and leave.
[3054.78s -> 3058.49s]  This is not a house. This is a bird. This is a shower. This is a shower that
[3058.49s -> 3067.42s]  goes in your house. I don't think the seal is good enough
[3067.42s -> 3075.98s]  though. There's no birds in Vegas. I slowly came to the realization about
[3075.98s -> 3079.08s]  this. All right, give me the instructions.
[3079.08s -> 3082.44s]  Who ripped them? That's what I want to know. Who ripped them?
[3082.44s -> 3085.64s]  Which one of you guys ripped these? Because I wouldn't, I,
[3085.64s -> 3092.25s]  one of you guys possessed me. I saw like
[3092.25s -> 3100.15s]  ripped paper and my eyes fucking turned red.
[3100.31s -> 3110.52s]  Why am I, what am I sitting like? Okay. Oh, it's just the old treasure map.
[3110.52s -> 3113.91s]  How do we build the old fucking hot tub, mate? All right, so
[3113.91s -> 3117.19s]  take a side wall piece E and run a thin line of glue on either edge.
[3117.19s -> 3119.27s]  That's not where we are. We already did that.
[3119.27s -> 3123.03s]  Lay roof panel F flat on working surface.
[3123.03s -> 3126.95s]  Place roof panel G at a 45 degree angle on top of panel F,
[3126.95s -> 3130.15s]  matching edges and nail holes. There's only one way to put these pieces
[3130.15s -> 3132.47s]  together. This will ensure proper alignment once you've lined up the
[3132.47s -> 3135.51s]  nail holes. Remove roof panel G and run a thin line on the length
[3135.51s -> 3149.83s]  Okay. Get out of my head. Stop it. Damn it. No. Okay, I'm back.
[3149.83s -> 3156.58s]  I'm just gonna, I'm just fucking connecting the damn thing like this.
[3156.58s -> 3160.98s]  There's only one way the thing can go. This is the way it goes.
[3160.98s -> 3166.73s]  Like that. Nail holes are here. I'm gonna do it off
[3166.73s -> 3181.05s]  camera. It's bitter. It's the shoe. It was the goblin. Okay, so here,
[3181.05s -> 3185.11s]  like right here. All right, the instructions weren't clear enough for
[3185.43s -> 3198.78s]  me. Like that. How the fuck am I gonna do this?
[3198.78s -> 3221.00s]  Do you see how impossible this is? How would a six-year-old do this?
[3221.00s -> 3224.63s]  All right, score check. I want a score check of the string. I told you it was
[3224.63s -> 3241.93s]  gonna be a three. Four? You can't, Jeremy, you can't
[3241.93s -> 3264.71s]  hold it and put it down and then hammer it. Why does that hurt?
[3264.71s -> 3274.82s]  Almost, this is gonna end bad. It's the only way I can do it.
[3274.82s -> 3283.91s]  Imagine if I missed. I would just hit myself like right in the chest.
[3283.91s -> 3287.83s]  My stomach is too malleable. It can't, it's not gonna work.
[3287.83s -> 3292.15s]  I have too much of like a jiggly stomach. I gotta like rock hard abs this.
[3292.15s -> 3307.58s]  Why is this not going, it's so loud. I'm sorry. Ready? I'm gonna try to talk over
[3307.58s -> 3311.90s]  it so it's not so loud. So sorry, it's loud. I'm, I didn't,
[3311.90s -> 3339.38s]  that's, that wasn't even funny. This is just
[3339.38s -> 3344.95s]  Nintendo Labo but dangerous. This is gonna be loud.
[3344.95s -> 3347.19s]  I'm gonna meet the mic because you're not gonna want to listen to
[3347.19s -> 3356.39s]  this. Trust me, you didn't want to hear
[3356.39s -> 3363.32s]  that. That's a little fucked up but that's
[3363.32s -> 3376.84s]  fine. All right, here comes the moment of truth.
[3376.84s -> 3388.73s]  Don't do it. Don't do that joke. Don't do it. No one's gonna think it's funny.
[3388.73s -> 3416.89s]  Castlevania, just pretend I did a Belmont thing.
[3416.89s -> 3422.95s]  Get in there. Get the fuck in there. Get in there.
[3422.95s -> 3433.90s]  Get it. Oh, get in. Oh, I'm just gonna put it on the ground, okay?
[3433.90s -> 3438.31s]  Why do I need to hang this? I'm just gonna put it onto the,
[3438.31s -> 3450.06s]  on the dirt. Fuck you. How did this even happen?
[3450.06s -> 3454.06s]  Birds fly? So they can land on the ground. They go to eat the worms in the ground.
[3454.06s -> 3459.32s]  They can't go in their house. Oh yeah, a squirrel will just go in
[3459.32s -> 3465.08s]  there and like take all their stuff. So add a security system, which is what
[3465.08s -> 3476.57s]  I'm gonna add. Okay, the chain is in. So how the
[3476.57s -> 3483.10s]  fuck do I do this? I have to connect these two.
[3483.10s -> 3489.86s]  How the heck am I gonna do that? What the heck is gonna happen? What
[3489.86s -> 3498.44s]  the heck? Okay, I need the knife.
[3498.44s -> 3511.99s]  What the heck, man? No, I need to paint this first. Get out of here.
[3511.99s -> 3517.08s]  Get it out. Get it out of here. This has to be painted
[3517.08s -> 3520.92s]  before the chain goes on. There you go. There's your little bird house, guys.
[3520.92s -> 3524.74s]  There's the fun little bird house. Okay,
[3524.74s -> 3529.35s]  now I need, how do I keep this on? Do I have to glue this?
[3529.35s -> 3531.91s]  All right, so do we want the bird house to have like a Sonic the Hedgehog
[3533.14s -> 3550.92s]  or like a visor? Well, balding. I mean, that's like balding or Sonic
[3550.92s -> 3554.60s]  because that's too typical. It's got to be like somebody's
[3554.60s -> 3559.22s]  blowing a hairdryer in the bird house's face.
[3559.22s -> 3562.36s]  Oh, that's right. That's a lot of shade for the bird.
[3562.36s -> 3569.13s]  That's a nice shade there. That's not bad
[3569.13s -> 3575.00s]  because then they can hang out. But what bird is, I don't know. This is what I
[3575.00s -> 3581.18s]  don't understand. The bird is supposed to sit here.
[3581.18s -> 3592.09s]  What bird is this big? This is a bird. A bird's not this big.
[3592.09s -> 3597.59s]  Is this a replica? Is this like not supposed to be held anywhere?
[3597.59s -> 3601.03s]  This is a bug house. This is going to be filled with fucking
[3601.03s -> 3607.10s]  cockroaches and beetles in like six months.
[3607.10s -> 3610.14s]  I'm going to look in there and it's going to be like
[3610.14s -> 3612.94s]  that X-Files fucking sound effect is going to play that like weird fucked
[3612.94s -> 3625.26s]  up violin. I'm going to cause an infestation.
[3625.26s -> 3629.18s]  Yeah, I know what a bird house looks like but, I mean, lots of birds have
[3629.18s -> 3635.74s]  nests that are like this big, right? They're like huge. A fucking
[3635.74s -> 3653.26s]  condor ain't going in there. A hawk ain't going in there. Uh-oh.
[3653.26s -> 3658.94s]  This is not good. That's not good. Oh, that's not good at all. This is not
[3658.94s -> 3671.43s]  even going to fit. Oh shit. How did that happen? Oh,
[3671.43s -> 3674.31s]  that's not good. But during the winter time they're going to get cold.
[3674.31s -> 3677.59s]  That's raft. All right, I'm just plugging it in.
[3677.59s -> 3683.06s]  I'm hammering it in. Where are the nails that I dropped?
[3683.06s -> 3699.59s]  Because I need both of them. Do you see it?
[3699.59s -> 3707.77s]  I have no idea where they are. All right, this is one.
[3707.77s -> 3715.16s]  I'm gonna have to glue this because I only have one. Wait, hold on a second.
[3715.16s -> 3720.44s]  Did I only drop one? I think I only dropped one, right?
[3720.44s -> 3739.67s]  Because how does this stay on? That was a disgusting, gross,
[3739.67s -> 3742.74s]  under-the-breath burp. Hold on, what are these?
[3742.74s -> 3750.68s]  What are these? These little hooks? What are those for?
[3750.68s -> 3755.00s]  Use the glue? But this is the fucking icing.
[3755.00s -> 3766.63s]  We're going with the shade because I want the bird to have a nice shade.
[3766.63s -> 3770.49s]  Let's get the glue on there. I don't want to use that much of this though
[3770.49s -> 3777.62s]  because I swear to god this is really icing.
[3777.62s -> 3780.50s]  And then I'm going to paint it. And you'd better believe that we're not
[3780.50s -> 3782.58s]  going to spend very much time on that shit.
[3782.58s -> 3796.52s]  The bird won't fit. Don't put that over there. I gotta think of a good color
[3796.52s -> 3799.16s]  scheme with the four colors I can choose from.
[3799.16s -> 3806.60s]  This is important. Yeah, but the bird. Yeah, maybe the bird. But then,
[3806.60s -> 3812.44s]  look, no, I'm doing the bald head because if a bird can't stand up, if a
[3812.44s -> 3815.64s]  bird's this tall, right, then it'll bump its head on
[3815.64s -> 3828.81s]  the ceiling. We're doing the bald head.
[3828.81s -> 3834.41s]  Ruined it. How did I ruin it? And there we go.
[3834.41s -> 3838.31s]  All right, this needs to be hammered a little bit. How can I do this in a
[3838.31s -> 3851.26s]  way that it's not going to? See? Look at that. It's perfect. What
[3851.26s -> 3858.42s]  happened up here? It exploded. I told you it was
[3858.42s -> 3873.75s]  going to. I split the wood. All right, so now it's
[3873.75s -> 3877.40s]  time to paint. This is going to be a joy. What about
[3877.40s -> 3882.98s]  this last nail? Not an extra nail. All right, let me show
[3882.98s -> 3884.90s]  you. Can I show you the utensil that they gave
[3884.90s -> 3891.78s]  in the box here? The utensil that they gave.
[3891.78s -> 3901.34s]  Are you ready for this? Here's how you're supposed to paint the bird house.
[3901.34s -> 3906.26s]  It's a fucking carrot brush. What am I supposed to do with this?
[3906.26s -> 3910.26s]  I'm supposed to paint with this fucking little carrot.
[3910.26s -> 3914.25s]  All right, important. Red roof, yellow roof,
[3914.25s -> 3923.10s]  white roof, blue roof. I ain't gonna, it's gotta, I'm gonna, it's gotta be one color.
[3923.10s -> 3931.58s]  I think, I think I like blue roof, but that's just me.
[3931.58s -> 3935.10s]  Because then we get blue and then blue,
[3935.10s -> 3941.75s]  white, blue, then sonic, and blue, yellow. No, I'm not making a sonic the
[3941.75s -> 3950.66s]  hedgehog birdhouse. Smart click. All right, fine. You
[3950.66s -> 3953.06s]  want to play that game? We can play that game.
[3953.06s -> 3990.25s]  Enhance it. Here we go. What have I selected here? Hold on.
[3990.25s -> 3993.53s]  Wait, I can rip these off, right? No, I can't. We gotta get even closer.
[3993.53s -> 4012.86s]  Fucking god damn it. Hold on. Okay, you ready?
[4012.86s -> 4025.69s]  Go for it. Ah, it looks like blue is, get, don't click my face.
[4025.69s -> 4029.06s]  Blue is winning by a lot. Yeah, yeah, I'll click.
[4029.06s -> 4049.14s]  Fuck! No! He distracted me! Why was, I'm such a total, I'm
[4049.14s -> 4057.29s]  looking at the, get away from me! Get out of here! I'm
[4057.29s -> 4061.94s]  not afraid to use it! Don't, I didn't hit myself in the fucking
[4061.94s -> 4069.86s]  face. All right, it was blue. All right, stop. Stop it. Everybody stop
[4069.86s -> 4078.55s]  it. Stop. All right, so the color of the
[4078.55s -> 4084.09s]  fucking roof. Okay, so the color of the roof is
[4084.09s -> 4088.65s]  gonna be blue. Please select the color. Please
[4088.65s -> 4093.16s]  select the color of the front panel here, the front.
[4093.16s -> 4104.66s]  What color is the front going to be? That was
[4104.66s -> 4117.40s]  blue. Blue? Is it blue or white? This is tough.
[4117.40s -> 4121.88s]  If only, if only like a massive amount of you guys weren't clicking
[4121.88s -> 4133.11s]  this spot right here. All right, it's gonna be white.
[4133.11s -> 4136.47s]  Why am I, I'm gonna hurt myself. Put that down. All right,
[4136.47s -> 4145.48s]  so we got blue, white. What would you like the back
[4145.48s -> 4150.36s]  panel to be? Don't vote yet. Back panel.
[4150.36s -> 4161.61s]  What do you want the back to be? Go ahead. I mean jeez.
[4161.61s -> 4169.35s]  Blue? Really? That's gonna fuck, that's gonna fuck it all up.
[4169.35s -> 4175.32s]  Blue? So it's gonna be, so blue up top,
[4175.32s -> 4181.69s]  blue on the back, white in the front. So then what about this, what about the
[4181.69s -> 4187.78s]  side panels? Side panels. What are the side, both, they
[4187.78s -> 4202.01s]  have to be the same. Side panels. Really, the whole thing
[4202.01s -> 4208.71s]  is gonna be fucking blue. The whole thing is gonna be blue
[4208.71s -> 4219.10s]  except for the white. Okay. What would you like
[4219.10s -> 4227.32s]  the bottom, the base to be? What is the base?
[4227.32s -> 4233.85s]  Oh, we're getting a little bit of a different story here.
[4233.85s -> 4241.30s]  Red. This is just gonna be Spider-Man house.
[4241.30s -> 4246.02s]  Oh no, it's red shoes for Sonic the fucking Hedgehog.
[4246.02s -> 4250.54s]  All right, bottom is red. What about the, most importantly,
[4250.54s -> 4258.31s]  the little tip. What's the tip gonna be? Sonic does not have a fucking
[4258.31s -> 4274.73s]  red nose. Yellow? Okay. I think I get what you guys are
[4274.77s -> 4280.28s]  saying here. So we got blue all around, blue, blue,
[4280.28s -> 4288.98s]  blue, blue, white in the front, yellow tip, red base. Okay, thank you for,
[4288.98s -> 4297.11s]  thank you for playing. Let's try to get this back to where it was
[4297.11s -> 4313.22s]  and begin painting. Fucking Sonic the Hedgehog.
[4313.22s -> 4317.11s]  Okay, so let's get this a little closer.
[4317.11s -> 4320.31s]  All right, that's good. So let's begin.
[4320.31s -> 4332.07s]  So how do I do this reliably? We have to start from the top.
[4332.07s -> 4334.95s]  No, we can't start from the top. I have to do the bottom first.
[4334.95s -> 4350.54s]  But how am I gonna, okay, bottom first. Red bottom?
[4350.54s -> 4353.90s]  Do I have to, are these concentrated orange juices? Do I need water for
[4353.90s -> 4433.46s]  this shit? No, I like this cup. Hold on.
[4433.46s -> 4438.10s]  Okay, so I got something to do this with.
[4438.10s -> 4444.50s]  I got like a machinimish mixer shot glass. I don't even know
[4444.50s -> 4447.46s]  where I, I don't know who this gave this to me.
[4447.46s -> 4456.70s]  Well, we're gonna use it to fucking dirty our brushes in.
[4456.70s -> 4459.58s]  I think I got that like, so I don't know why.
[4459.58s -> 4465.11s]  It was just in the group of glasses. Maybe you got it from machinima.
[4465.11s -> 4468.63s]  Probably, whatever. Let's just dirty our
[4468.63s -> 4476.46s]  brushes in there. All right, so we go with red, right?
[4476.46s -> 4483.53s]  Like this first? I have not painted in a very long time. Okay, so
[4483.53s -> 4486.49s]  I gotta be careful here. I gotta do this correct, because if I
[4486.49s -> 4490.26s]  don't do this correct, then the whole thing goes to hell.
[4490.26s -> 4518.65s]  I already started. You don't need water to paint it?
[4518.65s -> 4524.41s]  Wrong side, what are you talking about? This is the bottom. This is the bottom.
[4524.41s -> 4530.28s]  The bottom of the device. How could this be the wrong side? It's the
[4530.28s -> 4534.33s]  bottom. I don't, it's, this is not the top of
[4534.33s -> 4542.30s]  the birdhouse. You think I'm fucking dumb? I do need water for this.
[4542.30s -> 4552.92s]  It'll make it spread easier. Like, could they have given me anything
[4552.92s -> 4556.44s]  besides like the bridge cleaning dental device?
[4556.44s -> 4565.51s]  You know what I mean? Like, oh, I'm gonna clean into my dentures.
[4565.51s -> 4571.90s]  This is one of those fancy flosses that nobody uses.
[4571.90s -> 4577.43s]  Am I doing this right? But I can't be done after, I have to like, I have to
[4577.43s -> 4580.41s]  decorate it. I have to write like sayings on it.
[4580.41s -> 4584.97s]  Like, a couple of, I've got a couple of frags. You know what I mean?
[4584.97s -> 4595.86s]  Because it's a gamer birdhouse. This is already drying.
[4595.86s -> 4602.22s]  Give me that house. No, this is for the birds.
[4602.22s -> 4607.22s]  This is not for you. Not for me either.
[4607.22s -> 4626.25s]  It's for next week's recycling. I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, yeah, birdhouses.
[4626.25s -> 4629.21s]  I don't like the way this looks. I need like a brighter light on here. Give me
[4629.21s -> 4633.96s]  this fucking sun. There we go. Now you guys can see.
[4633.96s -> 4638.31s]  Look at how much better that is. You can give me like some tips
[4638.31s -> 4645.40s]  and some pointers. Get over here. I thought that-
[4645.40s -> 4650.33s]  Don't drop a fucking expensive light! Why are you like this light?
[4650.33s -> 4656.25s]  Stop! Oh my god, will you please just fucking stop?
[4656.25s -> 4661.35s]  There, that's better. I mean, I'm like blowing up my face huge, but
[4661.35s -> 4667.77s]  this is for you guys to be able to see the the colors here.
[4667.85s -> 4672.30s]  Was this- what? Hold on. I gotta like change the settings here because this is
[4672.30s -> 4680.31s]  blowing me out. That's better. Hey, look at that.
[4680.31s -> 4682.71s]  That's better. Now I don't look- well, I don't-
[4682.71s -> 4685.83s]  I don't have paint on my hands, right? I already have enough fucking hair
[4685.83s -> 4696.66s]  problems. Okay, here we go. So what did that guy-
[4696.66s -> 4700.34s]  jerma985? Is it j- is it jeremy985? What's-
[4700.34s -> 4704.04s]  what's his name on Twitch? Yeah, yeah, no, you had it right, man.
[4704.04s -> 4707.62s]  You watch that guy? Yeah, I mean, I check his stream out every now and then.
[4707.62s -> 4710.18s]  Like sometimes he's playing something cool or he's doing something.
[4710.26s -> 4713.86s]  I'm like, oh yeah, I'm like a fan. Oh, really? What's he doing now? Oh, dude,
[4713.86s -> 4717.86s]  probably something really fucking cool. Like, have you never heard of him before?
[4717.86s -> 4720.90s]  No, never. I did, but what is he- yeah, I'll check him out.
[4720.90s -> 4725.58s]  Yeah, right now he's uh, he- oh, I just saw what he was doing.
[4725.58s -> 4728.46s]  Uh, no, you know, man, like uh, you know, let's um, you want to like get in
[4728.46s -> 4730.94s]  the lobby and like play Overwatch or something, man?
[4730.94s -> 4733.42s]  No, no, I'm gonna check this guy out. You're like a fan of him. Yeah, I
[4733.42s -> 4735.58s]  want to see what he's doing. Yeah, no, but no, man, like we should
[4735.58s -> 4738.78s]  like go- I gotta go though, like uh, hey, just-
[4738.78s -> 4742.55s]  do you want a free Steam game? Yeah, dude, free Steam game. What are you talking
[4742.55s -> 4745.67s]  about? Yeah, uh, just pick a game that you want and just like don't open that
[4745.67s -> 4748.39s]  page, because like I think Twitch is fucking broken or something. Twitch is
[4748.39s -> 4757.67s]  fucked up. Yeah, man, I'll have to check him out
[4757.67s -> 4760.23s]  some other time. Yeah, some other time, like give me- he's live,
[4760.23s -> 4763.75s]  he's live like sometimes and he's live, he plays uh,
[4763.75s -> 4770.06s]  he's like, all right though, it's not today,
[4770.06s -> 4777.10s]  not today, Dan. Look at that, perfect coat of fucking paint.
[4777.10s -> 4780.14s]  You know, it almost makes me want to just grab it and fucking smear my
[4780.14s -> 4784.90s]  hands on it. All right, so now, uh, how do we- how do we wait till
[4784.90s -> 4795.45s]  this dries? I didn't think this through. I'm gonna do a second coat.
[4795.45s -> 4809.42s]  No, I gotta get the edges. This is kind of relaxing. Sometimes-
[4809.42s -> 4813.98s]  listen, listen to me, okay? Sometimes, you're like, we do a little
[4813.98s -> 4818.92s]  relaxing, fun little relaxing streams, you know? Not every stream has to be,
[4818.92s -> 4822.44s]  you know, something that you share with your friend. Sometimes we're just
[4822.44s -> 4826.04s]  gonna relax and then build a bird house on stream,
[4826.04s -> 4829.64s]  right? This is just one of those relaxing streams
[4829.64s -> 4832.68s]  that you'd refuse to tell your friends that exists.
[4832.68s -> 4839.98s]  Why do I have this shirt? It's alf, it's an old alf shirt.
[4839.98s -> 4844.41s]  It was a gift. I can't- I thought if I
[4844.41s -> 4849.88s]  even get one touch of paint on any other place but this is not
[4849.88s -> 4859.78s]  supposed to be, one push up. Then I'm talking about
[4859.78s -> 4863.14s]  over the course. If I do it once, it doesn't matter, it doesn't stack.
[4863.14s -> 4876.55s]  Whoa, dude, one push up. Yeah, one. No, fine, we'll make it 100.
[4876.55s -> 4892.06s]  Almost done with the base. No, I'm not. Okay, I gotta be very careful
[4892.06s -> 4896.38s]  because this- oh no, oh no, no, no. How am I gonna get
[4896.38s -> 4905.24s]  in there? This little bit here. Don't touch it.
[4905.24s -> 4909.16s]  All right, have we gotten to a point in the world?
[4909.16s -> 4911.96s]  Right now, I'm sitting here thinking, man, I have to like do all this shit by
[4911.96s -> 4914.76s]  hand. If this was just like a building
[4914.76s -> 4919.16s]  video game, I would put my cursor over this and it would go red
[4919.16s -> 4927.06s]  and I'd be done. I'm just thinking about, man, if I only had like the
[4927.06s -> 4933.21s]  paint tool and like house flipper or something, this is
[4933.21s -> 4936.87s]  gonna look really nice when it's done and then you guys can all say that you
[4936.87s -> 4943.45s]  helped pick out the colors because I made this. No, I did. No, I
[4943.45s -> 4954.66s]  did. No, I did this. Okay, I need a little bit of water
[4954.66s -> 4961.72s]  here. How am I gonna switch color? That's why I gotta get it all done
[4961.72s -> 4968.63s]  in one go, whatever color I'm using. Don't rush it.
[4968.63s -> 4971.91s]  This is not a video game. This is one of- this is one of those
[4971.95s -> 4976.95s]  experiments, guys, where we have to have patience, okay?
[4976.95s -> 4981.75s]  Sometimes you gotta bring yourself back to reality. Not everything can be
[4981.75s -> 5005.91s]  done by opening up a Google Doc. Google Doc painting. Well, you know what
[5005.91s -> 5008.70s]  I'm saying. Not everything can be done with a
[5008.70s -> 5014.33s]  fucking Google Doc. You know, back when I was a kid, if we
[5014.33s -> 5017.86s]  wanted- if you wanted to like say hello to somebody,
[5017.86s -> 5024.15s]  you know what our Discord chat was? The living room!
[5024.15s -> 5027.43s]  And I had to call up on the phone. Hey, what's up, man? You got- all four of us
[5027.43s -> 5029.83s]  want to get in the room and play Ninja Turtles?
[5029.83s -> 5049.00s]  Yeah, it was the living room. The arcade. Yeah, the arcade was awesome.
[5049.00s -> 5053.74s]  The crazy thing about the arcade, we're- we're in this- like, hear me out on
[5053.74s -> 5059.05s]  this, right? So it used to be back when video
[5059.05s -> 5062.65s]  games were just becoming very, very a popular thing and arcades still
[5062.65s -> 5065.69s]  existed. Think about, like, think about the original
[5065.69s -> 5071.77s]  microtransactions, guys. You used to have to pay like 50
[5071.77s -> 5075.13s]  cents to play a game. You'd go in and play Mortal
[5075.13s -> 5079.30s]  Kombat? No, no, that's 50 cents and if you lose,
[5079.30s -> 5082.34s]  go fuck and see you later. Give us another 50 cents or you can't play
[5082.34s -> 5093.90s]  again. What do you think they got the idea?
[5093.90s -> 5098.54s]  Not wrong. I mean, just think about it. And I would go into that arcade
[5098.54s -> 5102.71s]  with my allowance and I would spend- I would put 20 dollars in that
[5102.71s -> 5107.82s]  machine and out would spit for just 20
[5107.82s -> 5110.81s]  bucks and quarters. And I would spend it all in a
[5110.81s -> 5114.25s]  couple hours. All right, hold on, I gotta be careful.
[5114.25s -> 5119.03s]  Make sure there's no bubbles. It's gonna be hard with this little toothpick,
[5119.03s -> 5123.61s]  though. Yeah, it was an entertainment vending
[5123.61s -> 5125.05s]  machine. That's a really good way to put it.
[5125.05s -> 5136.44s]  Okay, now I've got all the edges done. Now,
[5136.44s -> 5145.00s]  how- how am I gonna do this? I think I can go underneath like this.
[5145.00s -> 5149.48s]  All right, this is where I gotta be actually careful because
[5149.48s -> 5153.83s]  as you see, I gotta get right in this little edge.
[5153.83s -> 5160.14s]  But it's okay, I can paint over it later. Play- play Christmas music? It's
[5160.14s -> 5164.12s]  not- it's not Christmas yet. It's not- it's not
[5164.12s -> 5175.96s]  Christmas yet. It's all right, I'm gonna paint over it.
[5175.96s -> 5182.95s]  Not bad, actually. Not bad at all. Spider on the wall.
[5182.95s -> 5192.18s]  Ah, let me get in a better position here. Spider on the wall. There's a
[5192.18s -> 5193.94s]  fucking spider, dude. What are you doing?
[5193.94s -> 5205.21s]  Stop what you're doing. But yeah, I mean, I remember arcades.
[5205.21s -> 5212.26s]  Arcades. I was gonna just say something but I forgot what it was.
[5212.26s -> 5224.87s]  Can you guys see that? Okay, looking good.
[5224.87s -> 5228.71s]  Looking good, Jeremy. Have you been practicing
[5228.71s -> 5231.19s]  off-stream with a paintbrush to make sure you didn't make a fool out of
[5231.19s -> 5238.41s]  yourself? No. No, I didn't buy five bird houses and
[5238.41s -> 5242.89s]  build them all five times to make sure I knew exactly
[5242.89s -> 5249.69s]  where the pieces went. You know, I'm not like that, guys.
[5249.69s -> 5257.40s]  I'm a genuine streamer. I wasn't even paying attention and
[5257.40s -> 5263.00s]  I didn't fuck it up. You know what I
[5263.00s -> 5269.77s]  could use right now? A piece of toast. Do I want toast
[5269.77s -> 5275.58s]  because this is reminding me of toast? These pieces. This is just bread. I'm
[5275.58s -> 5282.10s]  trying not to eat bread though. I'm trying to stay the fuck away from it.
[5282.10s -> 5286.58s]  Original Doom OST. I'm not putting on fucking do- oh my god.
[5286.58s -> 5291.08s]  Do you want to put on Doom for this shit? You want me to put that on?
[5291.08s -> 5294.33s]  Is that all you guys- do you guys listen to any other- I thought that
[5294.33s -> 5298.41s]  was an animal on my camera. I looked over at the
[5298.41s -> 5303.61s]  OBS preview and I thought this. I thought this was an animal in my
[5303.61s -> 5314.22s]  room. Anyways, do you guys listen to any
[5314.22s -> 5318.63s]  other songs? It's just, hey I got an idea. Doom
[5318.63s -> 5322.73s]  OST. Yeah, that's just what's always on repeat.
[5322.73s -> 5335.06s]  That's what my alarm is. I cook to it.
[5335.06s -> 5337.94s]  Although it's kind of like that with a lot of things.
[5337.94s -> 5341.37s]  Like I can tell you right now there are some songs on YouTube especially
[5341.37s -> 5344.97s]  where I am absolutely at least 10% of every single play.
[5344.97s -> 5355.00s]  Absolutely. The little hairs are coming off of this fucking toothbrush.
[5355.00s -> 5363.74s]  Is the bottom dry enough for me to put this down? I think it is.
[5363.74s -> 5369.85s]  We got a good coating on it. Filled in all the cracks. Just this last
[5369.85s -> 5375.42s]  little bit right here. See it? Don't worry, I'm gonna get it.
[5375.42s -> 5389.10s]  And then we'll put on the Doom OST. How many times have I caved in and
[5389.10s -> 5392.54s]  just put on the Doom soundtrack? I wonder how many times that's
[5392.54s -> 5403.18s]  actually happened. Doom OST. All right, looks good, huh?
[5403.18s -> 5426.74s]  Bang. So can, that shit's dry. No it's not, fuck. This is the edges are
[5426.74s -> 5437.91s]  like, I gotta spread the edges out. I'm bleeding. I cut myself accidentally
[5437.91s -> 5441.19s]  on the, on the wood. That's just, that's not, that's dry.
[5441.19s -> 5450.14s]  That's just blood. Should be a little more alarming.
[5450.14s -> 5484.57s]  Okay, I gotta, I gotta pass out. Don't do that. Okay.
[5484.57s -> 5490.86s]  Uh, I think it's good. Look, I don't cut all day, okay?
[5490.86s -> 5496.70s]  It's good. Wash it off in the machinima. Oh yeah baby!
[5496.70s -> 5502.38s]  Oh, look at that! Oh, I got this cool, awesome new drink idea.
[5502.38s -> 5508.68s]  Dude, check this out. It's the machinima slammer. Martini, man. Oh, we got,
[5508.68s -> 5518.50s]  we got triple sec, uh, rum, some watermelon juice. It's the machinima
[5518.50s -> 5524.44s]  slam. Yeah, you won't do it. I need another
[5524.44s -> 5536.73s]  color now, right? No way, I'm fine, right? Is this, is this gonna be dirty?
[5536.73s -> 5539.53s]  Because that's, we're done with the red. I see one little spot right there.
[5539.53s -> 5544.38s]  Let me just get it. Should this be in
[5544.38s -> 5550.54s]  arts and crafts now? Am I in the wrong category? This is just like,
[5550.54s -> 5556.25s]  I need to be in like, arts and crafts. How do I do that?
[5556.25s -> 5568.84s]  Arts and crafts. Art. This is not art, though. This is not art.
[5568.84s -> 5573.00s]  Uh, this is like, this is like offensive.
[5573.00s -> 5582.94s]  Oh yeah, I'm an art streamer. Look at me go like I'm painting a bird house.
[5582.94s -> 5589.19s]  Uh, crea- creative? There's no, creative? Destruction.
[5589.19s -> 5598.60s]  Go under body painting. I'm not gonna go under body painting.
[5598.60s -> 5609.75s]  Crafting? I just, uh, I don't, uh, what about like bird houses? Is there a
[5609.75s -> 5617.45s]  bird house category? God damn it. I just have to go into
[5617.45s -> 5621.83s]  art. And, okay, how about building a bird
[5621.83s -> 5624.87s]  house in parentheses. Don't watch this stream. It's not,
[5624.87s -> 5627.83s]  don't watch it. Don't tell your friends about it. No, that's like a
[5627.83s -> 5637.34s]  reverse psychology. Like, oh don't watch this, man.
[5637.34s -> 5642.74s]  Whatever, building a bird house. I was in just chatting before, but what's
[5642.74s -> 5650.54s]  like just chatting building a bird house?
[5650.54s -> 5654.30s]  All right, here we go. I did not forget about the Doom OST.
[5654.30s -> 5682.49s]  I can't fucking believe I'm putting this on. Give me a second.
[5682.49s -> 5744.33s]  Don't drink that! Welcome to the fucking Satan stream.
[5744.33s -> 5750.47s]  Whoa! Why have I made it a plastic? I swear to God I don't look like
[5750.47s -> 5756.57s]  this. I don't look like this. That's so
[5756.57s -> 5758.41s]  strange. I, this is something to do with the
[5758.41s -> 5762.73s]  lighting, I can promise you. I'm not like greasy. This is, I didn't
[5762.73s -> 5769.58s]  just paint my face. I just painted my face. That's what I did.
[5769.58s -> 5790.34s]  I painted my face red. I can't even see. I need to do paint.
[5790.34s -> 5872.28s]  Hold on, just hold on a minute. I'll be right back. Dude, it fucking stinks in
[5872.28s -> 5876.92s]  this room. I don't know why. It smells like old,
[5876.92s -> 5884.68s]  old like rubber mats. I don't understand why that is.
[5884.68s -> 5888.98s]  All right, back to, back to our Doom bird house.
[5888.98s -> 5893.90s]  So it was all blue, right? Blue everywhere on all the sides,
[5893.90s -> 5901.85s]  down the back, right? Or should we just do fucking
[5901.85s -> 5908.02s]  red? All right, let me close red. We don't need it anymore.
[5908.02s -> 5919.13s]  Give us the old boom. The old Doom. Doom, you know, I'm not doing all red.
[5919.13s -> 5924.86s]  We already voted on it. All blue up top. I can't fucking see
[5924.86s -> 5927.34s]  though. This is hard to see what, I can't
[5927.34s -> 5933.51s]  read this. This is the, it doesn't, it's messing with my brain. It's the
[5933.59s -> 5939.00s]  wrong color. See, you guys, we can't, that looks like
[5939.00s -> 5945.29s]  black. I'm gonna change the, the screen back to normal in a minute here.
[5945.29s -> 5966.70s]  That's right. We'll build a fucking bird house. I need more than that. I gotta
[5966.70s -> 5970.71s]  get like a lot on there. Not doing more than one coat. Just
[5970.71s -> 5974.82s]  get it on there. This actually is kind of working like
[5974.82s -> 5980.66s]  a black light, so I can see exactly where I haven't painted.
[5980.66s -> 5991.91s]  You want to put on the boom Doom? Boomer Doom?
[5991.91s -> 5996.07s]  Yes, I'll put on Boomer Doom in a little bit. Let me get one panel with
[5996.07s -> 6000.90s]  the original Doom new boom soundtrack.
[6000.90s -> 6008.54s]  The new boom, you know what I mean? It's all right if that's,
[6008.54s -> 6011.90s]  I got, I splattered it a little bit. What if we did like a cool thing where
[6011.90s -> 6016.10s]  it was like, never mind, shut the fuck up Jeremy.
[6016.10s -> 6031.16s]  Whoa. I say anybody that comes in from like the art
[6031.16s -> 6035.94s]  category, just, we need to just tell them that I did all this by hand.
[6035.94s -> 6040.30s]  Like I, I crafted the wood myself. I like cut it, I like did it with my
[6040.30s -> 6050.71s]  bare hands. When this is done, I know a lot of
[6050.71s -> 6054.07s]  people might be taking a little bit of jokes and talking shit,
[6054.07s -> 6060.42s]  but you are going to wish you had this birdhouse when it's done.
[6060.42s -> 6065.72s]  Which won't be very long from now. All right, this is, okay,
[6065.72s -> 6070.04s]  can I stop the boom joke? The Doom joke? All right, hold on.
[6070.04s -> 6072.20s]  I'm gonna like move out of the way so I can make sure I, because I need
[6072.20s -> 6082.57s]  to see it from afar so I can make sure the lights are correct.
[6082.57s -> 6099.50s]  There we go. Hey. Now we can actually see what we're doing.
[6099.50s -> 6112.28s]  It's purple, but we're on Twitch who gives a shit. That's my excuse.
[6112.28s -> 6127.05s]  So original Doom. Original Doom OST. Okay.
[6127.05s -> 6134.98s]  This is from, this is the original Doom soundtrack. I'm gonna put it low in the
[6134.98s -> 6136.98s]  background because I don't want it to be, I don't want it to take over the
[6136.98s -> 6147.50s]  stream. Not like it matters. What, what happened
[6147.50s -> 6155.59s]  here? Why is it yellow? Sonic the Boom House. Sonic the
[6155.59s -> 6161.27s]  Birdhouse. Sonic the Boom House. You guys got me
[6161.27s -> 6164.39s]  saying boom and boomer and shit. I don't know
[6164.39s -> 6178.70s]  who came up with that. Some television show.
[6178.70s -> 6210.94s]  Of course, bring it, we contribute it back to TV shows.
[6210.94s -> 6218.02s]  Someone just says stop. Stop doing what you're doing, Ralph, please.
[6218.02s -> 6228.25s]  I got, I don't need any more paint than this. This is a little too much.
[6228.25s -> 6232.25s]  This is a cute little bird house. Don't you think so?
[6232.25s -> 6267.80s]  What's wrong with you guys? Calm down. I feel like I've been doing the
[6267.80s -> 6287.56s]  same motion for five minutes straight. Fucking just move on already, man.
[6287.56s -> 6300.14s]  Squirreling in the holes. Look, it is perfect. It is perfect.
[6300.14s -> 6304.73s]  Ohhhh. I'm not doing it again, don't worry.
[6304.73s -> 6308.33s]  I had at least a thousand people just fucking clicked mute wicked fast right
[6308.33s -> 6318.15s]  there. Somebody was, I had a sandwich and
[6318.15s -> 6321.51s]  they like fucking dropped this shit. Fucking, god damn it, dude.
[6321.51s -> 6327.96s]  Jeremy, what the fuck? Like a food all over the floor. Right now they're
[6327.96s -> 6335.86s]  cleaning that all up and it's my fault. And it is.
[6335.86s -> 6338.50s]  Somebody's on their hands and knees right now because they dropped like a
[6338.50s -> 6341.14s]  fucking bowl of macaroni and cheese on the ground
[6341.14s -> 6350.89s]  because they thought I was gonna be really loud again. Okay, this is turning
[6350.89s -> 6355.05s]  into more of a Super Mario house than it is a Sonic the Hedgehog house.
[6355.05s -> 6359.74s]  I'm gonna have to finish it up by drawing his face on the front.
[6359.74s -> 6366.34s]  Right? All right, that looks good. We're completely coated on the front.
[6366.34s -> 6375.75s]  Same thing on this side. Just get a little bit of water on there to
[6375.75s -> 6381.05s]  loosen it up. You know, you know what I could
[6381.05s -> 6387.96s]  really go for right now? I should have a slammer. Triple
[6388.00s -> 6401.85s]  sack, rum, watermelon puree. I'm really craving one right now. I
[6401.85s -> 6404.09s]  could probably do this better with my hands
[6404.09s -> 6410.78s]  but I'm not going to because then what do I do with my hands? What am I supposed
[6410.78s -> 6421.67s]  to do with the hands after that? Paint. I'm okay, so if I if I dunk my
[6421.67s -> 6425.85s]  hand in here and smear it all over there and do it in five seconds.
[6425.85s -> 6429.69s]  Okay, that's great. Then what am I supposed to do with my hands?
[6429.69s -> 6432.81s]  I can't leave the room. I would have to sit here until
[6432.81s -> 6440.12s]  so I would have to scream for help. I'm gonna grab the doorknob with
[6440.12s -> 6445.46s]  paint all over my hands. Wipe it all over my nice shirt, you know?
[6445.46s -> 6453.80s]  Like, all you guys that are talking shit right now about this shirt.
[6453.80s -> 6457.56s]  Keep in mind I put this shirt on because it's like a shitty shirt
[6457.56s -> 6460.44s]  and if I got paint on it I wouldn't be it wouldn't be the end of the
[6460.44s -> 6463.16s]  world. When you paint you wear painting
[6463.16s -> 6464.92s]  clothes that you know you don't care about.
[6464.92s -> 6467.88s]  But I care a lot about this shirt. This is like a this was a gift
[6467.88s -> 6471.16s]  from my mother and it means a fucking lot to me.
[6471.16s -> 6474.28s]  So I'm not getting paint on it. She gave it to me a long time ago and
[6474.28s -> 6482.73s]  it's a really great fucking gift and I don't want to ruin it.
[6482.73s -> 6486.65s]  So was the table. But do you understand I-
[6486.65s -> 6501.53s]  No. Don't go that far. Your shirt is amazing, sweetie. Thanks, Mom.
[6501.53s -> 6506.71s]  Thanks a lot, Mom. I appreciate it. We're running
[6506.71s -> 6510.26s]  running out of blue paint just to let you guys know.
[6510.26s -> 6525.61s]  We're getting down to the bottom. God, oddly satisfying.
[6525.61s -> 6529.62s]  Like, yeah. Watching him paint that. Oddly.
[6529.62s -> 6540.90s]  You know what I'm saying? There's a dev in the chat? Dude, love your bird houses, man.
[6540.90s -> 6545.86s]  Can you uh confirm for the for the viewers here? First of all, yeah I mean
[6545.86s -> 6550.60s]  I think the release went really well. But can you confirm? Just I just was
[6550.60s -> 6553.56s]  curious is is there something about the in the factory
[6553.56s -> 6556.92s]  the way that they cut the pieces? Because some of the pieces weren't
[6556.92s -> 6560.12s]  matched up correctly but I mean but you can't- Come on. It's day one. Bugs.
[6560.12s -> 6569.45s]  You can't get over bugs on day one. So I understand but is it
[6569.45s -> 6571.77s]  going to be- Yeah. Day one bug. Like there was a
[6571.77s -> 6574.01s]  bug in here when I put it up on the first day.
[6574.01s -> 6580.50s]  Because I've had bird houses from the same company before. But there I
[6580.58s -> 6585.86s]  mean it's still a problem I think. All right so this is almost done here
[6585.86s -> 6590.92s]  and then we can do some finesse work. And then I'm gonna add the icing. I don't
[6590.92s -> 6593.16s]  give a shit if this is supposed to be a Sonic the Hedgehog house. He's
[6593.16s -> 6596.90s]  getting icing all over his head. What am I- What else am I supposed to
[6596.90s -> 6606.82s]  do with the glue? This is Christmas Sonic the Hedgehog.
[6606.82s -> 6611.19s]  I gotta really thin this out. The blue is going away.
[6611.19s -> 6613.83s]  I don't have very much and I have to do the whole rest of the house.
[6613.83s -> 6618.38s]  Any art people in here that know how to do that? How do I like make this
[6618.38s -> 6630.46s]  go further? Can I put like olive oil in there?
[6630.46s -> 6634.92s]  Paint thinner. Easier said than done when you- This wood
[6634.92s -> 6639.96s]  eats it up. It drinks it up man. Yeah something about- Your walls are just
[6639.96s -> 6645.14s]  drinking up the paint. That's why it's gonna take us a couple more days.
[6645.14s -> 6648.82s]  Yeah we put a coat on and your walls just fucking drank the thing up.
[6648.82s -> 6651.38s]  You know? We're gonna give us like four more coats.
[6651.38s -> 6655.22s]  It'll be like $425. It's not a big deal but you know your walls man
[6655.22s -> 6665.74s]  they just fucking drink it up. All right it looks good. Pretty decent.
[6665.74s -> 6670.54s]  Now that we have- We're missing a little bit down here.
[6670.54s -> 6682.01s]  Paint- Put less on your brush at a time. That's a good idea!
[6682.01s -> 6688.46s]  But you see what I'm saying? Look at the edge here. I mean your fucking walls
[6688.46s -> 6699.22s]  just fucking drink it up though. All right that looks fine. Let's see if
[6699.22s -> 6715.26s]  we can get away with this. Not getting away with it. This is
[6715.26s -> 6725.00s]  the hard part because this is where the little divots are.
[6725.00s -> 6730.33s]  Shit! I gotta go underneath. Can I- Can underneath be white?
[6730.33s -> 6736.90s]  Guys, do you care about that if underneath is white?
[6736.90s -> 6741.30s]  No. No it can't be. Why? Why can't I have the underneath be white?
[6741.30s -> 6755.70s]  Because it's Sonic but whatever. Doesn't Sonic have like white
[6755.70s -> 6762.12s]  frosted tips or is that his like- No that's his like weird cousin right?
[6762.12s -> 6771.74s]  Who's the Sonic the Hedgehog with the frosted tips? There really is one.
[6771.74s -> 6779.61s]  Silver. Silver the time traveling hedgehog right?
[6779.61s -> 6783.45s]  He went over real well. Didn't see him in another fucking game.
[6783.45s -> 6790.06s]  All right. Why didn't everybody tell me that I was dripping? I can use
[6790.06s -> 6795.75s]  that later though. I have to wait till this dries to do that part.
[6795.75s -> 6806.49s]  The front is white. All right. We let- This is going a little bit further than
[6806.49s -> 6813.34s]  I thought on the edge here because this is a smooth edge.
[6813.34s -> 6817.80s]  Looking kind of good. Looking kind of good.
[6817.80s -> 6828.25s]  Looks good. It worked. Now I'm just going to do that on all sides.
[6828.25s -> 6831.45s]  Thankfully the blue is gone after this. I have plenty of yellow too. Can I
[6831.45s -> 6834.41s]  just make his whole body yellow? You guys are not really going to
[6834.41s -> 6840.14s]  care that much. No one is going to care that much if
[6840.14s -> 6854.52s]  his body is fucking yellow. No no no no. All right my god.
[6854.52s -> 6859.35s]  And why do I care? Like the bird that's going to live in this house
[6859.35s -> 6862.31s]  is not going to worry about if his house looks like Sonic the Hedgehog.
[6862.31s -> 6866.12s]  I didn't know what that is. He's a bird.
[6866.12s -> 6869.48s]  Birds don't play video games no matter what Falco
[6869.48s -> 6885.03s]  tries to tell you. It's Falco's house. No it's not Falco. Well it could be.
[6885.03s -> 6888.39s]  Guys are you starting to realize that every fucking video game character is
[6888.39s -> 6890.79s]  the same color scheme? Are you figuring this out yet?
[6890.79s -> 6895.50s]  Think of a video game character right now in your head. Are they
[6895.50s -> 6910.38s]  are they red and blue? Yes they are. No no uh Doomguy. Doomguy is red and blue.
[6910.38s -> 6915.02s]  Look it up. Somebody said Link. Uh the the the game with on the DS with the
[6915.02s -> 6920.30s]  four of the links and the one was blue and red.
[6920.30s -> 6943.64s]  Metroid. Samus is blue and red. Pac-Man is yellow. Donkey Kong. His tie
[6943.72s -> 6947.56s]  is blue and red. Red tie with a blue
[6947.56s -> 6963.46s]  decay on it. Oh I'm almost out of fucking paint.
[6963.46s -> 6970.17s]  Oh this has got I gotta make this go longer.
[6970.17s -> 6975.26s]  Captain America. Blue and red. Spider-Man.
[6975.26s -> 6980.07s]  Blue and red. Thor. Blue and red. Iron Man.
[6980.07s -> 6999.00s]  Red with a little bit of blue and a small by orange for his eyes.
[6999.00s -> 7002.36s]  Heinz tomato ketchup. The weird blue bottle.
[7002.36s -> 7005.48s]  And it's red. And they did a blue they did a blue version of it too. Remember
[7005.48s -> 7025.13s]  the gross blue one that nobody wanted? Blue and red. What the fuck was that
[7025.13s -> 7031.74s]  noise? German 985. Well you're probably thinking
[7031.74s -> 7038.41s]  German your colors are not oh wait they're blue and red.
[7038.41s -> 7041.45s]  They're like teal and they're like a version of that.
[7041.45s -> 7054.73s]  Okay it looks good. Did I get some on me? No. All right we're
[7054.73s -> 7058.63s]  getting to the point where I need to I still have blue. I still need to do
[7058.63s -> 7061.27s]  blue. Just gotta do the back. Wait hold
[7061.27s -> 7065.85s]  on wait wait wait wait. Only the front is white right? Front is
[7065.85s -> 7070.18s]  white the sides are blue the back is blue.
[7070.18s -> 7075.66s]  Is that correct? Right he's right okay right right right.
[7075.66s -> 7092.70s]  I need to spread this out a lot because I did a heavy heavy-handed
[7092.70s -> 7100.46s]  coats on the top. And this children's toy only gives you
[7100.46s -> 7117.77s]  two teaspoons of paint. There we go nice and liquidy.
[7117.77s -> 7140.06s]  Who is white? Yeah white's in the front while blue's in the back.
[7141.02s -> 7153.21s]  It's not a big deal like I didn't just get what the fuck is wrong with me.
[7153.21s -> 7160.23s]  I can fix it later. That was a horrible jump scare in a horror game.
[7160.23s -> 7189.94s]  No I painted blue on the red. Whatever will I do? Okay I think I might
[7189.94s -> 7200.17s]  have just enough just barely. Gonna get underneath here. Good thing
[7200.17s -> 7203.26s]  the whole thing is blue. You guys really didn't make it that
[7203.26s -> 7206.65s]  hard for me. If you guys had made the sides yellow
[7206.65s -> 7209.93s]  the top blue the corner red you guys really just said
[7210.09s -> 7217.03s]  blue house. Do whole house blue. Made it pretty easy for me. Thanks guys I
[7217.03s -> 7225.30s]  appreciate it. Pay up with those push-ups baby arms.
[7225.30s -> 7231.46s]  What did I say I was gonna do one? I can't put this down.
[7231.46s -> 7240.06s]  Don't you realize this? I cannot put this down. You're gonna have to wait
[7240.06s -> 7251.67s]  a minute. Just remember that. They won't. Now
[7251.67s -> 7267.27s]  is the top dry? Not really. Gotta spread that shit out man.
[7267.27s -> 7277.05s]  This blue paint fucking everywhere. Thanks mom for the fucking desk.
[7277.05s -> 7301.56s]  I have to put this down. All right now I gotta do. I can't hold it.
[7301.56s -> 7308.10s]  I didn't think this through at all. Get out of the way machinima.
[7308.10s -> 7318.79s]  That table is now fucked up. No it's a memory that I'll never
[7318.79s -> 7325.19s]  I'll never lose. I always remember the day that we all built a birdhouse
[7325.19s -> 7332.41s]  together. You know what I mean? Remember the
[7332.41s -> 7334.97s]  time that he built a birdhouse and we were all there screaming and
[7334.97s -> 7349.99s]  cheering him on. You got to the finish line. I'm just
[7349.99s -> 7352.87s]  okay I gotta just pick it up. Just get just rip off the band-aid. Pick
[7352.87s -> 7375.43s]  the fucking thing up. I'm out of fucking paint.
[7375.43s -> 7382.30s]  Why wouldn't they give me like triple the amount that's in here? Who made this?
[7382.30s -> 7386.49s]  I did. I made this. Me. I did. I did this. Me. I did this.
[7386.49s -> 7411.56s]  Me. I did this. Change the OST. Hold on. I just gotta fill it in
[7411.56s -> 7415.70s]  good enough. It's a whole other side that I have to do and I don't have
[7415.70s -> 7419.29s]  any more blue. We're gonna have to desperate times call for desperate
[7419.29s -> 7430.79s]  measures because this is not going to work anymore like this.
[7430.79s -> 7466.98s]  Thing is fucking empty. Blue. Everything has to be blue.
[7466.98s -> 7481.88s]  I'm on the desk right? All right okay good. The top is so good
[7481.88s -> 7488.70s]  and the fucking god damn it. Mix the other colors.
[7488.70s -> 7498.73s]  I can't make blue with yellow and red? I can't make blue with white and
[7498.73s -> 7505.48s]  yellow. How do you make blue? Go buy more
[7505.48s -> 7510.01s]  paint. Use a blue marker. I don't think I even have a blue
[7510.01s -> 7513.21s]  marker. No. I can I can work with this. Just
[7513.21s -> 7537.70s]  wait. This soundtrack sounds like shit by the way.
[7537.78s -> 7543.78s]  I can't. It's not my headphones aren't in but all I can hear is like
[7544.10s -> 7559.27s]  and I'm does that that must sound fucking terrible.
[7559.27s -> 7570.12s]  Almost. And then we just deal with the consequences.
[7570.12s -> 7576.73s]  Oh I got it. It's over man. I got it. I'm gonna be good to go. What? That
[7576.73s -> 7586.04s]  was so unnecessary. Just put just add water and then swirl
[7586.04s -> 7591.22s]  it up and that's perfect. We're good. I can touch up
[7591.22s -> 7602.50s]  Bullshit later. Just want to make sure it's coated. Look at that. Doesn't that make you feel fucking great?
[7603.06s -> 7628.26s]  Okay, is a robot singing right now? I can't tell. Is there lyrics to this song? No. Okay, dude
[7628.26s -> 7633.68s]  Oh, man, you know what I'm craving right now? The new fucking drip from machinima
[7634.52s -> 7639.70s]  Bacardi 151 top it off with a little bit of rum chata underneath that a
[7640.28s -> 7644.96s]  layer of fucking orange juice and then blue food coloring
[7645.32s -> 7682.17s]  All right, almost done. See we stretched it out. We stretched it out guys. We made it
[7682.17s -> 7701.58s]  We stretched it out and we did it prices averted nice and blue just have to take care of the edges, but that's fine
[7702.10s -> 7712.45s]  The touch-up work can come later because I'm gonna use the white to do little touch-ups and I did not think in a fucking trillion years
[7713.09s -> 7717.96s]  That the birdhouse stream was gonna be more than two hours
[7718.56s -> 7723.17s]  not in a fucking
[7723.45s -> 7729.06s]  Million years I would have taken the bet last night if you said this was gonna take 15 minutes
[7729.50s -> 7741.74s]  Nah, dude, that's gonna take like 15 fucking minutes
[7742.26s -> 7753.06s]  Alright good gotta get the underside here. What do we really even need to? Oh
[7753.78s -> 7756.52s]  Fuck you, Jeremy. You touched it and it's ruined now
[7757.14s -> 7760.62s]  How am I ever gonna win the fucking birdhouse contest?
[7761.02s -> 7786.25s]  Just gotta get a little bit here and then the blue is done and I can finally it's empty empty empty
[7786.53s -> 7799.76s]  Actually empty actually literally physically literally physically fucking actually empty, you know, this is a pretty good Splatoon song
[7800.20s -> 7815.49s]  What's wrong the roof? What's wrong with the roof? The roof is a design choice
[7815.97s -> 7818.92s]  No, well, it's the reverse of the design choice
[7827.70s -> 7833.70s]  That looks a lot cleaner. So we're supposed to be shade for the bird
[7834.26s -> 7841.00s]  But we ran into a little problem where looked so cool if it was wind blowing against the house's hair
[7841.82s -> 7846.30s]  So we just said cool man. We decided to do that instead
[7846.98s -> 7852.98s]  Needs to be a thicker amount of paint here. And then we move on to the white
[7852.98s -> 7860.57s]  I'm gonna take the nub out that looks like shit
[7861.13s -> 7867.98s]  I'm not happy with that at all. It's this goddamn art, man. It's got to be the way that I want it
[7868.20s -> 7887.78s]  It looks fucking horrible back here
[7888.04s -> 7896.17s]  What what like fucking pizza delivery music is this is this actually doom?
[7896.85s -> 7912.52s]  Okay done
[7912.52s -> 7914.52s]  All sides are done
[7914.76s -> 7919.47s]  Blue blue, it's not perfect over here
[7919.99s -> 7943.95s]  See that you see look at the faint done. There it is. Now we just need to I need to wash my fucking hands
[7943.95s -> 7951.57s]  I can't see this the problem that I knew was gonna happen. Why didn't you why did you let me do this?
[7951.85s -> 7954.01s]  Why did you guys let me do this? Because now I can't leave the room
[7954.01s -> 7959.00s]  I can't touch anything over here because I don't get paint on my fucking mouse
[7959.60s -> 8117.28s]  Beck, okay clothes this weight. This is paint all over this. I'm not touching that ever again
[8117.28s -> 8127.80s]  Just open the white. All right front. This is this still is drying so I can't really touch it
[8127.80s -> 8139.65s]  Is there an OST still playing? Don't touch your mouse. You're fine. Okay, what other OST something like relaxing?
[8139.65s -> 8143.55s]  Something we could just chill to
[8143.91s -> 8145.59s]  Sonic OST
[8145.59s -> 8182.05s]  Sonic Mania complete soundtrack playing. Okay, Sonic the Hedgehog Sonic Mania OST
[8183.50s -> 8190.38s]  Sonic Heroes OST guys, it's so hard to decipher because this take 400 Sonic games
[8190.86s -> 8203.07s]  Okay, I have to hold it by this thing right there
[8203.07s -> 8250.80s]  I gotta use a lot because it's not showing up. This just looks like glue
[8251.40s -> 8270.87s]  Paste this looks so fucking bad. What's with this color opacity here? What's with the pigment? This pigment sucks
[8271.41s -> 8275.75s]  Dump the whole thing on there. No, cuz then it'll never dry
[8276.35s -> 8295.49s]  How am I ever supposed to draw Sonic the Hedgehog's fucking shitty face on here? I'm so mad right now
[8295.61s -> 8307.68s]  This was looking kind of good and now the white paint just ruined it doesn't even show up through the wood
[8308.24s -> 8310.24s]  I'm gonna have to do like five coats
[8317.31s -> 8319.27s]  Mix it in the glue
[8319.27s -> 8321.79s]  But I need this for the adult not not yet. That's
[8322.43s -> 8337.48s]  This is absolute last resort. This needs to dry and then we can figure out a fucking absolute last resort plan
[8338.16s -> 8347.20s]  If it doesn't work, how come all the other paints were so good, but this one was terrible
[8347.76s -> 8353.86s]  This is not even trying to be paint. I actually I'm pretty certain. This is not even his paint. This is not even paint
[8358.75s -> 8360.27s]  Absolutely not paint
[8360.27s -> 8369.07s]  Fucking bullshit. This looks terrible. Why haven't put this color in here, you know me why do what what instead of white?
[8369.07s -> 8371.07s]  why don't give like orange or
[8371.63s -> 8376.59s]  Brown or green whiz green you put up not a white that just doesn't work
[8376.59s -> 8396.88s]  I need layers, but I don't have enough to do that many layers
[8397.52s -> 8405.80s]  I really should just put fucking frosting on here. That's what it looks like
[8406.44s -> 8439.05s]  Are you fucking kidding me? It is frosting. What color is Sonic's eyes? Look at this up close
[8439.57s -> 8444.50s]  That's not even that's just powder
[8445.46s -> 8460.16s]  Baking soda on the front of this thing. I guess we could do the nose and then paint over it again
[8460.60s -> 8473.32s]  It's got to dry and then we'll do it again. Alright, so let me do some let me do some little bit
[8473.44s -> 8475.92s]  Alright, so this now that I have a minute here
[8476.64s -> 8478.37s]  Let's do the icing
[8478.37s -> 8483.96s]  Because this is this is done up top here. So what do you think like or horizontal?
[8484.70s -> 8485.82s]  vertical
[8485.82s -> 8499.87s]  What do you guys think? I would say probably horizontal like this just a little bit because it's so it's festive
[8499.87s -> 8502.47s]  What do you mean? Those are the spikes. That's spikes
[8503.27s -> 8506.70s]  How have you not figured this out yet? I gotta go like spikes
[8507.38s -> 8508.58s]  spikes
[8508.58s -> 8526.18s]  Don't ruin it. Oh, yeah, don't ruin it. Don't ruin this fucking great piece of work here
[8526.70s -> 8532.76s]  But don't ruin it
[8532.96s -> 8534.96s]  Hey, why was I saying? Hey
[8534.96s -> 8540.71s]  Hey, oops, that was I accidentally just turned off from Sonic the Hedgehog
[8542.27s -> 8546.94s]  Sonic was it Sonic Heroes you wanted Sonic Heroes
[8547.72s -> 8577.46s]  Ost. All right. I gotta dry this quicker. I fucked it up. I was gonna sing it, but I can't hear it
[8577.46s -> 8579.46s]  I was gonna lip-sync it
[8579.58s -> 8590.57s]  Whatever. All right, let's try another
[8597.60s -> 8599.60s]  I'm gonna see if I could fit something in there afterwards
[8606.23s -> 8610.63s]  Sharpie have a sharpie that'll do that
[8611.81s -> 8613.53s]  Let's try another coat
[8613.53s -> 8617.79s]  No, it just clumps up. You can't even see it
[8618.47s -> 8632.74s]  Whatever it Sonic's face is a little patchy, right? He's gonna have like a fucking goatee. Anyways, this Sonic has like a big goatee, right?
[8633.38s -> 8638.63s]  He is an animal. He is a hedgehog. Why would he not have a fur there? This is fur. That's perfect
[8638.63s -> 8640.63s]  Okay, that's fine. I'm okay with this
[8640.83s -> 8651.60s]  It's not gonna get any better than this. I mean the stream by the way fucking goddamn it
[8652.12s -> 8670.52s]  This really doesn't do anything. Okay, I'm gonna have to it's time for glue
[8671.00s -> 8673.00s]  I'm gonna see what it looks like. I'll try it in one spot
[8682.47s -> 8687.66s]  Doesn't seem to be helping much
[8687.66s -> 8699.27s]  But here's the what I'm gonna do with the glue. I'm gonna draw his face with the glue
[8699.67s -> 8707.59s]  That's right because I'm gonna mix in some blue into this bottle. I'm gonna shake it up and I'm gonna draw his face
[8708.15s -> 8718.71s]  This actually is working somehow
[8718.79s -> 8723.83s]  It's almost forcing the paint to clump together. So it makes a an actual patch
[8724.79s -> 8731.13s]  Like don't you remember that you guys have seen the videos where the guys make the pancake art
[8731.77s -> 8733.13s]  It's gonna be like that
[8733.13s -> 8735.13s]  except just forget about the pancake part
[8738.49s -> 8742.41s]  figure out what was wrong by the way, everybody everybody's gonna freak out but I
[8745.26s -> 8749.90s]  I should have painted the whole thing red and then I would have painted over the paint white
[8762.95s -> 8767.19s]  White over because look what's happening with it. Look look down here. See how this is actually coming up
[8767.75s -> 8769.27s]  It's coming up white
[8769.27s -> 8771.59s]  Rather than this weird fucking puke
[8772.47s -> 8776.52s]  I can't even say it
[8787.38s -> 8790.82s]  Started over and no, I want to get to the design. That's the best part
[8791.54s -> 8795.53s]  So I need to put
[8795.53s -> 8796.73s]  blue
[8796.73s -> 8801.11s]  Like I need a picture of son. Okay, turn the shitty fucking music off. It's not shitty. It's okay
[8801.67s -> 8804.71s]  For like a 2003 game. All right, um sonic
[8805.59s -> 8806.55s]  sonic
[8806.55s -> 8808.94s]  What does he look like?
[8808.94s -> 8812.65s]  What does sonic look like?
[8812.65s -> 8814.26s]  All right. It's
[8814.26s -> 8819.00s]  You guys made me do this all wrong. Why did you make me do it like this?
[8820.31s -> 8834.60s]  I it needs to be blue down to here eyes and then it's a yellow here. All right, so I need yellow
[8838.34s -> 8840.34s]  Might as well paint the stick here
[8841.54s -> 8843.06s]  We're so sorry
[8843.06s -> 8847.85s]  Don't be sorry. I'm just kidding. All right, white doesn't matter because it doesn't stick to anything. So
[8848.49s -> 8850.49s]  We just need to paint this thing yellow
[8859.38s -> 8876.26s]  This one sucks too
[8876.26s -> 8883.85s]  Whatever. All right. Look at that. Would you look at that? It's almost completely done
[8886.18s -> 8888.18s]  Just got here. How shit faced is jerma?
[8889.10s -> 8893.26s]  I mean not really I had um, i've only i've been drinking these machinima drinks
[8894.22s -> 8898.22s]  Like the latest one
[8898.22s -> 8900.22s]  the fucking moo machine
[8901.11s -> 8904.06s]  This is vodka cream
[8904.54s -> 8913.06s]  Heavy cream that is and then two droplets a fucking hot sauce
[8913.70s -> 8931.24s]  It's called the crazy fucking cow from machinima. All right, i'm done with this and we're gonna put the chain on
[8931.72s -> 8939.02s]  And i'm gonna hang it
[8939.02s -> 8940.86s]  You won't be able to see the hanging
[8940.86s -> 8942.86s]  Because that's not gonna all right. Well, there we go
[8943.34s -> 8946.86s]  I gotta fix the red down there
[8946.86s -> 8949.34s]  Do the face the face is gonna be very very much last
[8956.23s -> 8960.74s]  And then I gotta do push-ups. Yeah, don't worry. I'll do them. It's fine
[8960.74s -> 8965.70s]  All right, just need the red to get the bottom because that's all dry and then i'm gonna paint the sonic face
[8967.83s -> 8974.31s]  A bird's is what is it? What is this lead paint? What is this based off of this acrylic?
[8974.47s -> 8980.38s]  Can birds even like touch this stuff? I feel like a bird can't touch this
[8981.02s -> 8992.01s]  I feel like the music will hit them so hard when they land in here that'll make them say oh my lord
[8992.57s -> 8997.69s]  And then if they go to bird church, they'll be blessed
[9001.29s -> 9003.29s]  I'll take the minus twos for that. That was fucking horrible
[9009.99s -> 9017.93s]  All right. Hold on nice coat of red
[9027.51s -> 9035.19s]  Almost done. You guys won't let me put on the icing. I'm just gonna do it off fucking camera. Anyway
[9035.75s -> 9039.56s]  Anyway, thanks coming up the stream guys. That was a lot of fun and see you later
[9039.56s -> 9041.80s]  I'm gonna fucking drench it with icing
[9042.52s -> 9056.82s]  All right. I'm above bob ross right now
[9060.94s -> 9066.68s]  Jesus christ
[9066.68s -> 9070.34s]  All right one more little coat
[9070.34s -> 9073.62s]  And I can say that this is ready to dry while I do the face
[9077.75s -> 9079.29s]  We're ready
[9079.29s -> 9083.45s]  Seems sturdy seems like a good fit for any sonic the hedgehog bird
[9086.23s -> 9087.83s]  Let's do the face
[9087.83s -> 9090.55s]  So let's see if my tactic is gonna be worth doing
[9091.19s -> 9095.37s]  We'll just do yellow. So I need to put yellow paint in this glue jar
[9097.54s -> 9105.42s]  How am I gonna do that?
[9105.98s -> 9108.20s]  It's got limoncello
[9108.20s -> 9112.04s]  And it's apple cider. This was called the shooter
[9126.31s -> 9128.31s]  No, never mind. I wanted that
[9139.61s -> 9142.65s]  He's breaking down. No, i'm fine. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Here we go
[9143.05s -> 9144.33s]  I'm gonna get this
[9144.33s -> 9148.34s]  Into there and then we're gonna stir it. This is gonna be hard because take a look at the little hole there
[9150.60s -> 9153.56s]  But man if this works, I will be a fucking genius
[9154.36s -> 9178.92s]  It's working. It's working
[9181.18s -> 9189.05s]  Everybody thought I was insane. That's not gonna work. Jeremy. Oh really
[9190.42s -> 9207.51s]  Take a look at my science almost there and I'm gonna put the gap back on
[9210.68s -> 9223.98s]  Don't just i'm why am I showing this to you guys it's not that important. There we go
[9225.21s -> 9227.21s]  It is a nice dyed yellow
[9229.46s -> 9238.28s]  Put the cap back on and here we go. Check this shit out. All right sonic's face
[9298.18s -> 9300.18s]  His nose is inside of his mouth
[9302.28s -> 9336.60s]  I can fix it. Hold on. Oh, well if it wasn't safe for birds before it's definitely not safe for them now
[9338.50s -> 9340.82s]  What'd you use for the paint there? Oh glue
[9352.55s -> 9364.66s]  Plank from ed ed and eddie
[9364.66s -> 9365.78s]  I can't put my hands on this
[9365.78s -> 9369.38s]  I need to put the chain on and I still need to figure out these fucking two hooks or four
[9370.02s -> 9426.78s]  All right, one last be right back. Hold on. Fuck. Why did I even shut the door that tight? I almost just dumped this
[9427.50s -> 9591.45s]  I almost got it open. It's close
[9596.79s -> 9601.06s]  I tried to get it open with my foot and I couldn't get it. Okay, so
[9601.86s -> 9618.02s]  Uh, we're good, right? It moved it moved, huh? Listen closely. There are screams coming from the bird house
[9619.85s -> 9640.81s]  I don't think I want this in my house. You know what I mean? No shit. It's a bird house
[9640.81s -> 9648.79s]  Yeah, but I don't think I like want this near my house. All right. There you go. There's bird house. Let's get these hooks or four something
[9649.27s -> 9653.88s]  Finishing touches and then we smash it
[9654.52s -> 9677.54s]  It's a treasure map three pieces
[9678.18s -> 9689.34s]  Three pieces. That's all I got three pieces. All right, so you've created a okay. This is a very hold on
[9689.34s -> 9692.78s]  Wait, this is a very specific bird house for very specific birds
[9694.39s -> 9697.11s]  Get out get out of the fucking way dummy
[9697.67s -> 9702.87s]  All right, so this bird house is for somebody look this up and see if these are in vegas
[9705.48s -> 9708.94s]  Uh, you've just created a perfect home for chickadees
[9710.71s -> 9724.60s]  Nut hatches and finches are any of those in las vegas. I don't think I don't think there are any
[9729.11s -> 9731.67s]  The only birds that we have here in vegas are scorpions
[9733.18s -> 9735.18s]  Okay, so connect
[9735.50s -> 9740.50s]  I can't believe I have to use the fucking treasure map to figure this out
[9744.65s -> 9746.65s]  Lay roof panel on flat surface
[9750.20s -> 9752.26s]  match up the help
[9752.26s -> 9754.26s]  Lay roof panel flat on surface
[9755.58s -> 9758.22s]  place roof panel at 45 degree angle
[9758.86s -> 9761.90s]  proper once you have lined up the nail holes remove
[9762.86s -> 9763.82s]  roof
[9763.82s -> 9767.18s]  Remove roof panel g and run a thin line of glue along the connecting edge play
[9767.82s -> 9770.46s]  Connect one end of the chain to a hook
[9771.26s -> 9773.26s]  Run it through the bottom
[9773.74s -> 9777.66s]  Of the roof across the top and back down again attaching it to the other hook
[9787.50s -> 9790.38s]  Where's the chain? I know I my mother took it from me because I was playing with it too much
[9791.58s -> 9793.58s]  All right, so like this
[9796.63s -> 9797.59s]  Okay
[9797.59s -> 9804.82s]  Hold on just like the crane game. I can get it
[9806.92s -> 9809.00s]  This is just one of those tense scenes in a movie
[9809.48s -> 9813.96s]  Where I have to be very quiet because like the weird pig guard over there like the guy with a pig face
[9814.44s -> 9817.32s]  He's snoring and he's fat and he's like he ate a bunch of same shit before I came over
[9817.32s -> 9819.32s]  And i'm trying to get the key from his fucking side of his pocket here
[9824.98s -> 9829.78s]  Oh, he woke up. Oh, hold on. Hold on a second. Hold on. Okay. He's back asleep. I gotta get that key
[9854.04s -> 9857.56s]  Just fucking karate chop him in the back of the neck and then take the key. That's what I would do
[9865.18s -> 9869.21s]  I'm stuck. All right, so I need to feed this through here
[9871.11s -> 9877.18s]  Like this
[9877.18s -> 9883.77s]  Wait, hold on. No, no, no, no, this has to go the other way put the hooks down
[9885.59s -> 9886.87s]  For a second
[9886.87s -> 9888.63s]  Jesus jason
[9888.63s -> 9890.63s]  Oh real name. Fuck
[9941.46s -> 9943.78s]  Get in the fucking hole
[9945.11s -> 9948.23s]  It's really just too it's too thin
[9949.14s -> 9952.39s]  It won't go through good and
[9965.18s -> 9966.14s]  Hey
[9966.14s -> 9969.27s]  I'm getting paid. Oh, that's stupid
[9970.07s -> 9974.63s]  Fuck. No, i'm getting it everywhere. God. Damn it. This stupid face
[9976.98s -> 9981.02s]  It's a glue
[9982.87s -> 9989.19s]  That's not gonna dry i'm wiping it off. Oh, it's ruined. I've ruined it. Look at the side of the fucking house
[9989.83s -> 10002.39s]  I want to show you that i'm trying it. Do you see what's happening here?
[10003.35s -> 10015.51s]  The shit it don't want to work like it don't work it doesn't want to okay got it now
[10027.48s -> 10029.24s]  What does this want me to do?
[10029.24s -> 10033.34s]  You know what I mean?
[10033.34s -> 10038.17s]  How does this want me to actually do this do I have to I have to hang this I have to drill those holes somewhere
[10043.53s -> 10048.46s]  What labo is this?
[10048.94s -> 10051.18s]  This is pretty much a labo stream
[10052.60s -> 10058.74s]  So then it wants because then you hang it like that. Okay, so this has to come out here
[10059.94s -> 10081.30s]  The hole is just not big enough for the chain to be in here. It's a problem with this device
[10084.57s -> 10085.69s]  All right
[10085.69s -> 10087.69s]  We're almost through completely
[10089.96s -> 10091.96s]  So that's that's through
[10092.12s -> 10093.72s]  like this
[10093.72s -> 10095.96s]  So, but am I supposed to have these connected?
[10096.86s -> 10098.86s]  So it's like that
[10098.86s -> 10107.05s]  You feel like it's not that hard
[10110.44s -> 10127.14s]  Sure, it's in
[10128.10s -> 10129.96s]  Now these get connected
[10129.96s -> 10136.31s]  And then it hangs somewhere now. The question is how the fuck am I going to connect these?
[10141.74s -> 10143.56s]  Who needs it?
[10143.56s -> 10153.61s]  Perfect. I need to test it though
[10164.18s -> 10166.02s]  Got it. Look at that
[10166.02s -> 10169.62s]  It's ready. All right. Now we need to like put stuff in it to pretend there's a bird in there
[10171.59s -> 10177.29s]  Here I got an idea
[10177.29s -> 10179.29s]  Get wait get in there
[10179.77s -> 10186.25s]  See, it's like a little bird
[10186.25s -> 10200.12s]  Um, okay. I gotta make a family and see how they like it in there. Okay, there's one
[10200.76s -> 10208.60s]  Gotta get the baby bird
[10208.60s -> 10210.92s]  See, it's like a little baby bird, right? See
[10213.70s -> 10217.42s]  I'm gonna make the papa bird
[10235.99s -> 10241.48s]  Um, whatever this is
[10241.56s -> 10243.56s]  Yeah, so now there's a family in there
[10245.96s -> 10258.22s]  Close this shit up. Let's take a look. How does it how is it pretty good? I think so
[10258.70s -> 10262.33s]  This is sturdy
[10262.33s -> 10273.48s]  If it was just hanging on the side there, see that's what's gonna look like when it's hanging
[10281.19s -> 10286.18s]  Smash it with the birds in there. I need to connect this though because this it seems
[10287.16s -> 10288.68s]  I can't really bend it
[10288.68s -> 10295.35s]  It looks like I can but it's I need like a wire
[10295.83s -> 10298.31s]  I need a like a wire cutter or pliers or something
[10300.02s -> 10302.02s]  Well, whatever. All right
[10302.02s -> 10306.68s]  There's your bird house
[10311.10s -> 10318.14s]  No, it can't fit in there
[10320.95s -> 10322.95s]  I can't put any more birds in here
[10323.43s -> 10325.66s]  Now un-paint it
[10325.66s -> 10327.98s]  What do you mean? I can't un-paint a bird house
[10331.37s -> 10333.37s]  Make the hole bigger with the hammer
[10333.93s -> 10335.45s]  No, this is perfect
[10335.45s -> 10345.42s]  Okay, it's good
[10345.50s -> 10348.15s]  Now burn it
[10348.15s -> 10359.05s]  Wait, how how how am I gonna get that out of there? Oh that that stuff is just in there
[10368.68s -> 10418.23s]  This is bad. I gotta I gotta get rid of that. The wood is split here. Why is that not doing anything?
[10418.31s -> 10433.61s]  Come on get in there. All right, we're good
[10458.94s -> 10468.09s]  What is with the scooby-doo nails like I smash one and the other one opens up whack-a-mole. Oh my god. It's stuck in here
[10482.73s -> 10485.93s]  Jesus. All right. We're good
[10490.23s -> 10496.07s]  Okay, it's all free in there. See I need a little bit more of this to put this back on
[10501.22s -> 10503.94s]  This is like hey you Pikachu
[10504.66s -> 10517.32s]  The hell are you talking about? I used all the glue to do the stupid face. Didn't I? Nope. We're still good
[10518.66s -> 10520.66s]  Just need enough to put it on there and so it stays
[10524.46s -> 10529.96s]  Perfect. All right. Come on just a little bit more. That's like you never saw a fucking thing
[10531.29s -> 10533.30s]  Got it
[10533.30s -> 10552.15s]  Okay
[10552.15s -> 10555.51s]  Back to normal. There it is
[10555.51s -> 10558.38s]  Eat the glue. I'm not gonna eat the fucking glue
[10559.88s -> 10561.88s]  Glue your fingers together
[10562.60s -> 10564.60s]  That doesn't work guys. This isn't a cartoon
[10572.18s -> 10577.91s]  There we go
[10577.91s -> 10588.31s]  There's the bird house. The chain has been the hardest part. That's what broke it the first time. Just do it very carefully
[10590.44s -> 10593.00s]  Glue your tongue to a lamp post. It doesn't work. I've tried it
[10602.20s -> 10603.42s]  All right
[10603.42s -> 10605.42s]  There it is. There's your bird house done
[10607.29s -> 10610.81s]  I can't wait to this fucking chain. It's just whatever
[10611.67s -> 10614.87s]  It was it looks fine. It looks all right. It looks cute
[10615.43s -> 10625.80s]  What do I mean pull? What am I doing a pull for?
[10630.57s -> 10635.62s]  A pull for what for this?
[10635.62s -> 10638.50s]  The roof is backwards. No, that's sonic the hedgehog
[10638.98s -> 10648.26s]  That's what we decided on a thousand volts. Where do you think i'm gonna get a thousand volts from?
[10652.54s -> 10654.41s]  Look at the paint
[10654.41s -> 10657.96s]  What I mean this paint is some paint here, but that's okay
[10658.44s -> 10662.76s]  As long as I don't get it on my desk or on my mouse or on my face or on my body. I'll be fine
[10665.67s -> 10669.27s]  Have we has has sonic heroes been playing the background this whole time? I hope it hasn't
[10670.57s -> 10677.83s]  Under the roof
[10677.83s -> 10693.50s]  I don't have any I don't have any blue. There's no more blue left. It's gonna have to be red
[10694.06s -> 10697.45s]  To my i'm not gonna smash it. This has been almost three hours
[10697.85s -> 10705.45s]  This has been three hours to make this fucking thing. Perfect. Okay, the roof is so bad
[10707.30s -> 10719.82s]  I'm not gonna smash it. This is a this is a piece of memorabilia. It's a memorabilia piece
[10720.30s -> 10727.00s]  That glue is actually pretty good
[10727.00s -> 10733.26s]  Fix it with the hammer. I'm gonna get this away from me. Don't put it over there because it's paint on it
[10733.50s -> 10734.86s]  I have to look at it
[10734.86s -> 10737.64s]  All right. What am I doing with the treasure? I gotta like clean up
[10740.28s -> 10746.98s]  Sell it how much would you help? Okay, let's start it. Start the start the bidding
[10747.54s -> 10750.18s]  Start the bidding start the bidding at 30 cents
[10750.74s -> 10765.34s]  Well, that was fun
[10766.79s -> 10773.66s]  I pulled it off the auction. Okay, i'll give you i'll give you six golden rings for it
[10774.38s -> 10779.56s]  I'll trade it for a better one. I made myself
[10786.46s -> 10790.38s]  The back does look a little fucked up, but it doesn't matter. We tried our best
[10791.18s -> 10795.02s]  The resources that we had four dumb shitty cheap paints
[10795.66s -> 10798.70s]  A little stick of don't eat me glue a treasure map
[10799.26s -> 10801.26s]  And badly cut wood
[10822.36s -> 10828.54s]  Never mind. This took him four hours. Don't add time for no reason. It was three
[10829.02s -> 10831.58s]  This took him four hours. This would be three hours
[10831.66s -> 10834.54s]  Okay, not four don't add time to make it funnier
[10834.78s -> 10841.10s]  It was three and by the way an hour of that was us just chilling out and talking and playing in our irl stream
[10841.34s -> 10847.05s]  So it wasn't a complete and total build that I left. I washed my hands. It probably took like
[10847.53s -> 10853.21s]  Two and a half hours and we were just hanging out. We that's what we were doing today
[10854.79s -> 10862.17s]  I'm gonna smash it. Don't smash it. This didn't take nine hours
[10864.14s -> 10866.14s]  I look like kind of dirty today
[10867.19s -> 10870.17s]  It's because of this that's right. I forgot
[10876.28s -> 10880.20s]  Face cam you putting it up. Where am I gonna? Oh, I have to do a push-up, right?

[10896.44s -> 10900.15s]  To somewhere safe
[10900.55s -> 10907.85s]  Just move the whole fucking thing. Hold on
[10908.01s -> 10910.01s]  It looks like a torture instrument
[10913.78s -> 10915.86s]  It's very clearly a bird house
[10917.98s -> 10919.82s]  Oh, hey birdot

[10934.39s -> 11012.60s]  For a second. Hold on. Okay
[11013.43s -> 11015.11s]  So whoa
[11015.11s -> 11017.11s]  Hold on. That's
[11017.27s -> 11033.86s]  hold on there
[11033.86s -> 11042.04s]  Naked see I had to wear clothes today and that sucks move this back to here
[11042.52s -> 11053.45s]  Actually, let me just go like this. All right. So, uh, that was that thank you for joining me on that
[11054.94s -> 11057.06s]  Let me move
[11057.06s -> 11059.91s]  Do I have?
[11059.91s -> 11063.62s]  Yeah, I should be using the other camera, but it's all good
[11065.02s -> 11067.14s]  It's all good
[11067.14s -> 11071.30s]  So that was kind of the plan today and i'm going to give you a couple of things to look forward to
[11072.17s -> 11076.71s]  Uh, oh, that's disgusting. That was not a bug around my hand. Okay
[11077.51s -> 11080.07s]  So many people are gonna freeze frame this image
[11080.63s -> 11082.76s]  It was like this
[11082.76s -> 11087.24s]  And people are gonna be like what the fuck is that on his thumb? There's like yellow green boogers on his hands
[11087.24s -> 11094.10s]  It's paint. Oh freeze it right there dude. What does he have in his thumb? Is that like fucking schnauz?
[11096.22s -> 11099.34s]  No, so, uh, I want to go over a couple of things while there's still a lot of people here
[11099.58s -> 11101.58s]  Thanks for coming out. That was just a stupid
[11101.82s -> 11106.86s]  Uh one guy said to do that and that was that was the stream was the one guy said to build bird house
[11108.68s -> 11110.68s]  Proving yet again that you could be the one guy
[11111.35s -> 11115.75s]  Uh, but what i've been doing the last couple of days and today and i'm going to continue to do today
[11116.31s -> 11118.31s]  And probably tomorrow and for the next few days
[11118.95s -> 11123.61s]  The christmas eve stream is is there's two things that are going to happen here
[11124.89s -> 11130.22s]  Uh, I can't really talk about them yet, but is that if I can get
[11130.94s -> 11132.38s]  studio time
[11132.38s -> 11137.67s]  On christmas eve watch out for that fucking stream because it's going to be insane
[11139.50s -> 11143.50s]  If I can do what I want to do on christmas eve i'm going to try and that's why I took the last couple days off
[11144.39s -> 11147.03s]  Um, not green screen part two something completely different
[11148.25s -> 11149.29s]  uh
[11149.29s -> 11151.51s]  If I can get in there
[11151.51s -> 11154.02s]  I'm gonna have a lot of fun
[11154.02s -> 11156.02s]  So it's something i've been trying to plan
[11156.10s -> 11160.22s]  And something i've been spending a lot of time recently trying to get it to work
[11160.62s -> 11163.98s]  And if it doesn't work if I can't get into the studio on christmas eve
[11164.46s -> 11166.46s]  We're still going to do something
[11166.46s -> 11170.38s]  That's going to be very very fun. I'll give you more details very soon
[11170.38s -> 11174.54s]  I've only got like another couple days to plan this really before knowing if it's going to be possible
[11175.02s -> 11181.03s]  In studio or out of studio. So it's kind of what i've been doing over the last uh,
[11181.51s -> 11185.59s]  No, not ipad game something different something that you haven't seen before on the channel something different
[11186.23s -> 11190.12s]  Something a little different but let me uh move with this
[11190.84s -> 11199.43s]  I need to I need like the better camera because after this this camera like sucks
[11204.20s -> 11207.16s]  But it does i'll tell you what it does involve. No, I can't i'm not gonna do that
[11207.78s -> 11212.26s]  There's like five different segments that are gonna be on that stream if it happens and it's gonna i'm gonna put a ton
[11212.34s -> 11223.22s]  Of time into it. Well, that's as good as i'm gonna be able to get because I can't put the other camera in
[11225.02s -> 11227.10s]  It's an incoming joke. No, no incoming jokes
[11227.66s -> 11239.42s]  Well, actually incoming joke potentially on the 24th because that's christmas eve gonna play alf shirt. Yeah
[11240.79s -> 11243.19s]  No problem. This motherfucker used to eat cats. You know that right?
[11247.21s -> 11251.93s]  I thought he was a cat. He's a cat with
[11253.58s -> 11255.58s]  Look at this like pompadour haircut. He has
[11257.91s -> 11263.00s]  You sure? Yeah, I know we've talked about the hole in the shirt. I need to get off of um
[11263.16s -> 11269.94s]  I need to get off of this because i'm on art right now and i'm just kind of sitting here
[11270.02s -> 11272.02s]  So let's go back to just chatting for a little bit
[11272.66s -> 11278.98s]  So plan over the next couple days like oh what no no title just chatting. No that I build a birdhouse complete
[11280.02s -> 11281.46s]  birdhouse
[11281.46s -> 11282.74s]  done
[11282.74s -> 11285.30s]  and then in brackets
[11285.30s -> 11290.02s]  Pretty decent. Okay, and then this is just chatting
[11291.64s -> 11293.64s]  Because that's what we're actually doing now
[11295.51s -> 11309.66s]  Oh, I think I got the push-ups. Fine. Here you go. I can't you can't even see this
[11313.85s -> 11315.85s]  This is what's this tv?
[11316.17s -> 11319.61s]  No, that's my chair. I thought that was like a giant fucking tv. Get out of the way
[11323.26s -> 11333.82s]  You can see here. Okay. Come on. There you go. I don't care green. Where's green from?
[11334.38s -> 11349.24s]  I thought there's a person behind me. What the fuck is wrong with me right now? What's wrong with me?
[11351.24s -> 11353.24s]  I thought this was a person
[11354.02s -> 11356.02s]  Like standing behind me
[11358.33s -> 11360.33s]  I'm losing my fucking mind
[11360.57s -> 11364.38s]  I just caught it in the peripheral like who the fuck is that guy?
[11367.88s -> 11371.32s]  Too much paint. Yeah, I'm like breathing these fucking fumes
[11373.48s -> 11378.46s]  But anywho, yeah that so let's go over a couple things one christmas stream
[11379.26s -> 11381.02s]  Uh incoming
[11381.02s -> 11385.98s]  And it's gonna be fun and whether it's in the studio or not in the studio. I got two different plans
[11386.94s -> 11389.18s]  Tomorrow, we're probably gonna play hotline miami 2
[11389.74s -> 11393.42s]  And i'm just gonna play it all day and all night. That's the plan tomorrow
[11394.79s -> 11395.99s]  uh
[11395.99s -> 11397.94s]  and then
[11397.94s -> 11400.38s]  so monday
[11400.38s -> 11402.87s]  I'm probably going to take
[11402.87s -> 11404.87s]  monday and tuesday off
[11405.27s -> 11408.95s]  Because I desperately want to try to get this stream to work for christmas eve
[11409.43s -> 11416.41s]  And it's gonna take a lot of off stream work where I can't really be live. I have to be making phone calls and hiring
[11417.14s -> 11419.06s]  people and
[11419.06s -> 11424.02s]  Without giving anything away. I have to really really give it an honest try because I think it's gonna be a lot of fun
[11424.74s -> 11430.74s]  So that's the plan over the next couple of days tonight. We had this tomorrow. We're doing hotline miami
[11430.82s -> 11433.54s]  I don't i might try to beat all of hotline miami tomorrow
[11434.74s -> 11437.46s]  Try to give you guys like a good like eight to ten hours stream tomorrow
[11437.78s -> 11440.90s]  Just fucking beat the damn game just play it and fucking engross into it
[11443.62s -> 11449.91s]  Nervous streamer. No, I don't think so when I talk about
[11451.11s -> 11452.55s]  I'll give you a little
[11452.55s -> 11455.83s]  Uh in depth into my life here when i'm just like being me
[11457.00s -> 11463.72s]  It's like hard to just be me i'm gonna be with a camera on like if i'm doing like a character or like
[11463.80s -> 11468.52s]  Voices look at how easy i'm not nervous at all, but i'm like, hey, i'm just like talking to you guys
[11468.52s -> 11472.52s]  I'm like a camera on it's like wait, hold on. I gotta be me
[11475.86s -> 11478.02s]  So guys, uh, hey, it's me and uh
[11484.66s -> 11489.94s]  Is there a guy i'm kidding i'm not nervous. I don't know why I would be why would I be nervous right now?
[11492.74s -> 11494.74s]  I don't have like a reason to be nervous
[11494.90s -> 11499.58s]  Just kind of I just talk too fast
[11499.58s -> 11504.46s]  Stop shaking speaking of shaking. Is there any coffee left in here or tea?
[11509.27s -> 11512.55s]  All right. I had a panic attack in my brain for a second. I thought there was paint in here
[11513.58s -> 11517.26s]  I thought because remember I reached over to this and I was like, oh, yeah dip that in there
[11517.90s -> 11521.58s]  I thought like it was like three hours ago now. I thought I did that
[11522.30s -> 11529.54s]  There's nothing even look at it's like empty you want me to drink that gross dirt at the bottom
[11530.10s -> 11536.09s]  He's flying off the handle. No, but that's the plan
[11536.57s -> 11539.21s]  I really hope I can get it to work because it'll be
[11541.26s -> 11543.26s]  If I can do what I want to do on christmas eve
[11543.26s -> 11548.23s]  It will be the most intricate stream that i've ever done by far
[11548.87s -> 11556.57s]  By a fucking million times so it's gonna be we'll try i'll try i'm gonna try as hard as I fucking can
[11556.81s -> 11561.26s]  But if I can't get it
[11561.34s -> 11567.85s]  Then we'll have plan b and plan b is not as elaborate and intricate as the studio stream is
[11569.46s -> 11574.44s]  But it'll still be a lot of fun
[11574.44s -> 11577.32s]  This is not something that i've talked about before this is just a christmas
[11578.38s -> 11580.87s]  Themed stream that's all you need to know
[11584.79s -> 11589.27s]  But let me let me hammer out some of the details before I really like announce anything because it's very easy to be like
[11589.35s -> 11593.11s]  So this is what's happening on christmas eve and I hope you're there and it's gonna be a lot of fun
[11593.19s -> 11599.88s]  And this is exactly what's happening and then some of it just doesn't happen. So I'd rather why are you guys adding push-ups?
[11604.58s -> 11612.09s]  What what what what what's this command that we're adding from push-ups somebody adding plus one push-up
[11613.99s -> 11624.31s]  Why I didn't do them all. Oh, it's being deleted. It's being deleted. Okay, I get it
[11626.57s -> 11628.57s]  Why would you be counting those in the first place?
[11633.99s -> 11636.17s]  christmas eve present
[11636.17s -> 11638.15s]  maybe
[11638.15s -> 11639.93s]  maybe
[11639.93s -> 11642.33s]  Keep your ear to the ground over the next few days guys
[11645.16s -> 11647.16s]  hopefully I have something interesting to announce but
[11647.72s -> 11651.48s]  Uh speaking of that it's still early enough where I can go work on it
[11652.18s -> 11656.23s]  So i'm gonna i'm gonna get out of here now short three hour stream

[11838.33s -> 11840.73s]  I don't here here's tip number one. I don't put any
[11841.45s -> 11843.06s]  product in my hair
[11843.06s -> 11848.33s]  Right. I use products in the shower. So i'm in the shower and I use good
[11848.97s -> 11852.41s]  Shampoos and conditioners and then I don't do anything else to it
[11852.41s -> 11855.13s]  And I let it do what it's gonna do and make sure it's nice and fluffy
[11856.94s -> 11860.22s]  I don't put hair gel mousse. I don't do that at all. Never
[11866.94s -> 11874.39s]  Your hair is fluffy in the shower when you get out and you fluff it up
[11875.21s -> 11877.21s]  I get I fluff it up and then I leave it alone
[11879.80s -> 11881.80s]  Moose hair what?
[11882.12s -> 11889.83s]  How often do I comb only after the shower? So I get out of the shower. I brush my teeth
[11890.39s -> 11892.79s]  Sometimes I brush my teeth in the shower to save some time
[11893.35s -> 11895.85s]  Sometimes I piss in the shower
[11896.09s -> 11897.85s]  To save some time
[11897.85s -> 11899.85s]  Uh, and then when I get out of the shower
[11902.39s -> 11907.27s]  I just go live with a comb not a fine tooth comb because you know, you don't want to rip out hairs
[11911.13s -> 11913.13s]  You go back with it. You know what I mean?
[11913.45s -> 11916.01s]  You just kind of get it nice. So it's not all crazy and
[11916.57s -> 11921.13s]  Flip it up a little bit make it do fluff it up and then leave it alone and make sure it's it's been combed
[11921.45s -> 11925.90s]  And then I leave it alone
[11925.90s -> 11929.74s]  Why we all yeah you all everybody pees in the shower. Don't ever anybody that's weird
[11930.38s -> 11931.98s]  Why do people say that?
[11931.98s -> 11935.42s]  What the fuck you what's wrong with you? You did that today
[11936.14s -> 11940.74s]  I know you did
[11940.74s -> 11942.42s]  I know you did it today
[11942.42s -> 11954.38s]  did I ever tell you guys the story of when I was in college and somebody was peeing in the shower and
[11955.02s -> 11960.22s]  Everybody was upset about it. It's like dude. Somebody's like pissing in the shower. Somebody's peeing in the shower, dude
[11960.22s -> 11962.70s]  I don't know. Who is it? It was like 10 of us
[11963.42s -> 11968.09s]  Like almost 12 of us that lived in this place and there was detective work
[11968.09s -> 11970.09s]  Everybody was trying to find out who it was
[11971.53s -> 11974.41s]  And huh, here's the punchline all of us was doing it
[11975.78s -> 11979.06s]  It was like pretend we were pretending that we were upset about it for some reason
[11979.38s -> 11982.66s]  Nobody wanted to get caught
[11982.66s -> 11992.65s]  It was at least like four or five of us that were doing it and I remember sitting on the couch being like who's fucking
[11992.65s -> 11994.46s]  Doing this man
[11994.46s -> 11998.46s]  That's like really messed up like stop doing that like we go in there and I was doing it
[12007.85s -> 12010.73s]  There are people who piss in the shower and then there are liars
[12014.82s -> 12025.70s]  Do you pee in other people's showers guys? I don't piss in the shower every fucking single time
[12026.34s -> 12028.34s]  Okay
[12028.34s -> 12035.67s]  Please be clear about this
[12035.67s -> 12045.59s]  If I come over to your house, I'm not gonna pee in your shower. No, I'm not I wouldn't do that
[12049.50s -> 12052.31s]  I'm a liar
[12055.80s -> 12058.36s]  Don't invite him over your house man. He's gonna pee in your house
[12060.44s -> 12064.84s]  Why are you showering at my house? Because because you invited me over there and I like stay the night
[12065.32s -> 12072.12s]  What do you mean? Why am I this we're talking about if I was invited to sleep over and I stayed there and I agreed
[12072.20s -> 12074.20s]  And we both were like, yeah, that would be fun
[12077.56s -> 12080.12s]  Do you shit in the shower too? No, it's a polar deal
[12080.12s -> 12083.16s]  You gotta open up the drain and it's like a pain in the ass. I haven't I don't do it anymore
[12094.92s -> 12097.80s]  I'm sorry anymore
[12097.80s -> 12101.34s]  No, never I pee in the shower like three times a year
[12102.36s -> 12104.60s]  This is all this is all just smoke and mirrors
[12108.50s -> 12113.86s]  Anyway, thank you to sprite 37 for the one dollar. Hope you're enjoying las vegas and it's treating you better than it did
[12114.42s -> 12116.42s]  Me before I moved away several years ago
[12117.22s -> 12119.22s]  Be safe and I hope you have a chance to check out
[12119.84s -> 12122.90s]  Excalibur's tournament of kings if you decide to visit the strip
[12124.30s -> 12126.30s]  There's a lot of interesting stuff on the strip
[12126.95s -> 12129.85s]  But yeah, you do have you do have to like just be careful
[12131.42s -> 12133.26s]  You can get really sucked in
[12133.26s -> 12135.80s]  to the vegas culture
[12135.80s -> 12137.06s]  so
[12137.06s -> 12140.87s]  actually, um
[12140.87s -> 12144.55s]  I wanted to go to the esports arena at some point here
[12145.19s -> 12150.94s]  To check it out because that's on the strip. I think we were talking about that
[12151.34s -> 12164.36s]  A few weeks ago in the luxor. Yeah, did you move to las vegas? Yes, I did
[12164.84s -> 12166.92s]  Uh just about a few months ago now
[12167.64s -> 12174.94s]  Back in october
[12174.94s -> 12176.94s]  Well, I don't think you're ready to compete
[12178.79s -> 12181.59s]  No to watch
[12181.59s -> 12183.59s]  And i'm gonna go to evo this year
[12184.31s -> 12186.47s]  Because that's right in vegas. Oh
[12188.92s -> 12192.62s]  I've always wanted to go to evo just because I feel like it's an interesting thing to watch
[12198.54s -> 12202.38s]  I want to go watch like mortal kombat 11 at evo. It'll be held by then
[12207.42s -> 12209.02s]  What the hell is evo?
[12209.02s -> 12211.26s]  Uh evo is the fighting game tournaments
[12211.90s -> 12217.35s]  But yeah, I I kind of said I wasn't gonna do any more
[12218.23s -> 12221.51s]  any conventions for the next probably six to twelve months just because
[12222.71s -> 12225.26s]  Moving was very expensive
[12225.26s -> 12226.22s]  and
[12226.22s -> 12227.50s]  Spent
[12227.50s -> 12232.06s]  We spent we've spent a lot of money so far just on getting this place livable
[12234.70s -> 12236.62s]  So I kind of like yeah, you know that
[12237.34s -> 12239.34s]  that expensive trip to
[12239.98s -> 12247.82s]  Like twitchcon or the the expensive hotel rooms at packs east going back it's I just I don't think I'd be able to do it
[12251.58s -> 12253.42s]  but 2019
[12253.42s -> 12259.70s]  Somewhere in the halfway point in the summertime. I'll probably be making my way back to conventions and stuff. So
[12261.93s -> 12267.48s]  Anywho, uh, thank you sprite. I've been enjoying vegas so far. Thank you
[12269.29s -> 12273.05s]  Joey fedacini. Thank you for the 27 dollars and 50 cents
[12274.12s -> 12279.35s]  No message. Thank you. Joey. Thanks for the 27 dollars
[12281.56s -> 12289.40s]  Appreciate it and there is no message here put all your money on red. No
[12292.86s -> 12295.66s]  No
[12295.66s -> 12300.94s]  Thank you to uh, jinxibo for the 10 dollars here. We had a big nearly 30 dollars
[12301.67s -> 12304.17s]  From joey and then a big 10 dollars here from jinxibo
[12305.02s -> 12309.02s]  Jerma is like that weird uncle who keeps telling the same fucked up story every time you meet him
[12309.34s -> 12311.34s]  And you're still not sure if it's real or not
[12311.58s -> 12314.86s]  So you sit there nervously contemplating whether you should laugh or not
[12315.26s -> 12318.14s]  I got you right where I want you
[12318.22s -> 12322.55s]  It's like anything could be real
[12322.63s -> 12347.40s]  Anything could be real. You know what I mean? What does your reality look like? Huh?
[12350.71s -> 12359.40s]  Hmm. Tell me what does your reality look like?
[12360.04s -> 12369.03s]  What does your reality look like? But you can't even see it. You're gonna turn off these monitors
[12369.83s -> 12375.18s]  It's a this ball. It's a glow-in-the-dark like squishy ball
[12381.58s -> 12383.34s]  I don't know why this is in here
[12383.34s -> 12386.18s]  Hold on. Can you see?
[12386.18s -> 12392.47s]  I gotta
[12392.47s -> 12398.07s]  Let that sit there for a minute. It's I fucked it up. It doesn't matter
[12401.62s -> 12404.18s]  I he could wait down. All right. Whoa
[12406.04s -> 12410.28s]  See, it looks like this. There we go. It's kind of glowing. I gotta get all these monitors turned off
[12410.92s -> 12430.55s]  Hold on. All right. Ready?
[12430.63s -> 12444.04s]  Well, don't drop it. What the fuck does your reality look like?
[12444.60s -> 12480.23s]  Let me get let me get like a little bit more juice on it. Okay, that should be better
[12481.59s -> 12487.00s]  Nice
[12487.00s -> 12492.17s]  This thing is fucking powerful. What the fuck?
[12495.34s -> 12518.26s]  Whoa, what the fuck turn the fucking lights back on man. This is freaking me up. I can see you guys again
[12518.50s -> 12525.80s]  I've got a slimy face
[12529.06s -> 12537.21s]  Nice joke idiot. I don't have a slimy. It's a contrast
[12537.61s -> 12540.65s]  You see goes if you see me if you those of you see me in real life
[12540.97s -> 12545.30s]  You know that I don't have a slimy face
[12549.74s -> 12557.08s]  Uh, thank you slimer. Oh, thank you slimes for the five dollars. That's a really
[12557.80s -> 12561.56s]  Perfect name to read right this second. No message. Thank you slime

[12576.20s -> 12578.04s]  out loud
[12578.04s -> 12581.05s]  For those of you boomers in here
[12582.26s -> 12586.90s]  Hey, awesome. Awesome alec. Thanks for the one dollar. If you were a bird, I think you could fit in that house
[12588.81s -> 12592.07s]  back to back
[12592.07s -> 12596.50s]  Back to back. Hey dubski dude. Thanks for the one dollar
[12596.50s -> 12600.26s]  The act of you turning on your webcam is the equivalent of taking a sledgehammer to my already
[12600.88s -> 12602.88s]  fragile heterosexuality
[12608.39s -> 12615.93s]  Well, thank you dubski
[12615.93s -> 12617.93s]  Thank you so much for the one dollar
[12618.25s -> 12622.15s]  Although I don't know I have like weird days
[12623.90s -> 12626.06s]  I have days where I look in the mirror and I go. Ooh nice
[12626.14s -> 12628.14s]  And then I have days where I look in the mirror and I go. Ooh
[12630.60s -> 12633.67s]  I think we all have those days though
[12633.75s -> 12636.87s]  But thank you
[12636.87s -> 12638.31s]  Thank you
[12638.31s -> 12643.19s]  Thank you. She xoxo for the one dollar. Hey germa. Where did you get that pac-man mug?
[12643.99s -> 12648.49s]  Looks really neat. I have secret locations like amazon.com
[12650.95s -> 12653.27s]  Now you can get it. There's a lot of places you can get it get it online
[12656.30s -> 12660.06s]  You can get it. There's a lot of like novelty gift stores. You can get it at if you have
[12660.78s -> 12662.78s]  One of those weird novelty stores near you
[12667.51s -> 12669.78s]  Sponsored by amazon
[12669.78s -> 12672.02s]  Now this whole website is sponsored by amazon
[12672.02s -> 12678.09s]  What are you on about the entire this whole entire platform is now sponsored by amazon the whole thing
[12683.48s -> 12685.48s]  I didn't that's not my decision
[12691.38s -> 12693.62s]  But thank you for the one dollar
[12693.70s -> 12696.42s]  Hey logan. Thanks logan for the one dollar. Hey germa. I've been a big fan
[12696.74s -> 12699.86s]  I've been a big fan since tf2 days and this is the worst thing i've ever seen
[12700.82s -> 12704.18s]  Thanks god bless hashtag charity. I told you guys
[12704.98s -> 12716.33s]  I've made sure your expectations were very low today. Thank you logan. Thank you. Novi for the one dollar
[12716.33s -> 12720.01s]  This is more embarrassing than the raptor hashtag charity. Nope. What?
[12722.54s -> 12727.50s]  Me building a bird house on stream is more embarrassing than me putting on
[12728.06s -> 12730.54s]  A dinosaur costume and making dinosaur noises
[12731.18s -> 12739.66s]  No fucking way absolute there's no way that I can agree with that they're about equal
[12745.42s -> 12747.42s]  Thank you, thank you hans beats for the two bucks
[12747.42s -> 12749.50s]  He's still going to do the do the music stream
[12750.30s -> 12753.42s]  In fl studio love the streams. Thanks for the laughs. Yes
[12756.36s -> 12758.36s]  That's kind of in the back pocket right now
[12760.47s -> 12764.63s]  In fact, that will probably end up being the next large stream
[12765.64s -> 12768.12s]  after the christmas one
[12768.12s -> 12770.12s]  Because I have quite a few ideas
[12770.86s -> 12774.22s]  And now that I have access to that studio and I told you pretty much like once a month
[12774.22s -> 12776.62s]  I want to get in that studio and do something
[12778.23s -> 12781.27s]  And we're talking about potentially hiring like a real band
[12781.83s -> 12783.67s]  to like record and
[12783.67s -> 12785.67s]  Make terrible fucking music
[12788.52s -> 12790.52s]  I mean
[12790.52s -> 12793.96s]  There's I have access to stuff now that I never had before
[12798.62s -> 12803.02s]  Hire like a hire like an actual audio engineer to mix together songs
[12803.90s -> 12808.06s]  This this goes way beyond me just fucking around in fl studio at this point
[12818.73s -> 12820.73s]  Make up the band name make a whole album
[12822.15s -> 12825.11s]  God, we'll see though. I'm i'm i'm into it
[12825.67s -> 12829.59s]  So but now that'll happen after the christmas stream because if the christmas tree does happen
[12830.23s -> 12833.35s]  The way that I want that will also be a fairly large stream. So
[12834.17s -> 12839.37s]  Got to spread them out once a month or so once every like 40 30 to 45 days. That's what I want
[12842.01s -> 12845.93s]  Uh, thank you tingy for the one dollar. Remember to pick up the nails you dropped ps. I'm really glad you're not
[12846.49s -> 12848.49s]  a contractor hashtag charity
[12851.08s -> 12855.16s]  Yeah, if I I did I did kind of make a fool out of myself trying to hammer those in didn't I
[12857.40s -> 12858.90s]  That's all right
[12858.90s -> 12863.78s]  Thank you butter dirt for the one dollar. If you really want to do this. Well, you'd use wood glue and clams
[12864.50s -> 12865.70s]  German moon
[12865.70s -> 12871.75s]  It was whatever came in the kit. Oh clamps. Okay
[12874.10s -> 12878.66s]  Ferotian weapon. Thanks for the ten dollars ferotian looks like you don't skip arm day
[12880.33s -> 12883.08s]  I never used to and it just stuck with me
[12883.16s -> 12886.68s]  I I did so many arm workouts guys that my arms still look fucking sick
[12887.24s -> 12898.30s]  It uh, I don't even do it anymore, but thank you for the ten dollars ferotian weapon. Appreciate it. Thank you so much
[12899.69s -> 12901.13s]  Extra cheesy. Thanks for the one dollar
[12901.13s -> 12904.17s]  I was on break at work and showed someone your stream while I was watching it
[12904.17s -> 12907.13s]  They looked at me with a mix of confusion and judgmental contempt
[12907.93s -> 12911.45s]  Also, if you had to pick one, would you rather be stranded somewhere really hot or really cold?
[12912.58s -> 12920.97s]  Uh, really probably really hot. I mean they both have awful consequences really cold you freeze to death really hot you dehydrate to death
[12922.81s -> 12929.29s]  Which one of those things would you rather do probably hot because I feel like I could like
[12929.93s -> 12931.05s]  search
[12931.05s -> 12932.17s]  While it was hot
[12932.17s -> 12945.50s]  You can't really search when it's cold for stuff because it's your body locks up and heat you die slower
[12945.58s -> 12947.58s]  Yeah, but that gives me more time to search
[12948.09s -> 12949.13s]  for like
[12949.13s -> 12952.57s]  I don't know i'm stranded on a desert island. We're like the fucking bananas and coconuts and
[12953.41s -> 12957.11s]  Strawberries and carrots and shit. They might be on that island. I can that gives me more time to find them
[12963.40s -> 12969.08s]  Thank you irate gamer screen cap for the one dollar germa you'd look really hot in a choker
[12969.64s -> 12975.10s]  I don't know why I just read that
[12975.10s -> 12977.88s]  Thank you for the one dollar demonic cucumber
[12977.88s -> 12981.16s]  Thanks for the one dollar considering the large amount of predatory birds in the vegas area
[12981.48s -> 12988.04s]  Are you sure that by encouraging smaller birds to stay in one place you aren't just building a bird feeder for a larger audience?
[12993.53s -> 12998.56s]  We're making just like a live feeding den for vultures
[12999.36s -> 13006.59s]  Thanks for the advice
[13006.59s -> 13011.56s]  Thank you to par follow eel for the one dollar. It's a youtube link. I'm not gonna make the mistake by clicking it again
[13014.76s -> 13025.90s]  Uh, it's a guy like putting a bird in his mouth. I want a fun fucking thank you for the one dollar
[13028.75s -> 13030.75s]  extra cheesy
[13030.83s -> 13035.15s]  Thank you. Why is the game cube intro playing? What the fuck? Okay, here we go
[13037.37s -> 13038.65s]  Thank you
[13038.65s -> 13044.81s]  One dollar extra cheesy the judgmental man was some old crotchy guy who wouldn't understand the antics of us
[13045.21s -> 13050.81s]  Fry young streamers such as yourself. So don't worry. You're still cool. Also, i'm the place you're stranded on
[13051.29s -> 13054.09s]  Would you rather eat a razor death adder or a logitech mouse?
[13055.05s -> 13058.97s]  Well, a razor death adder would mean I would have to have it with me and I would not want that with me
[13060.43s -> 13062.91s]  So I probably want to take the logitech mouse
[13069.52s -> 13072.72s]  Thank you. Demonic cucumber again for the one dollar. Hey jeremy back again
[13073.12s -> 13075.36s]  Wanted to clarify something about my bits from earlier this week
[13075.36s -> 13080.24s]  What I meant was you are a very attractive man regardless of your age not in spite of it
[13080.64s -> 13082.88s]  I'm crushing pretty hard to be honest
[13086.80s -> 13088.81s]  Well, thank you
[13088.81s -> 13090.97s]  No, that's very very kind of you. That's very nice of you
[13092.14s -> 13093.80s]  um
[13093.80s -> 13095.64s]  I don't
[13095.64s -> 13097.64s]  Thanks. I don't
[13098.92s -> 13102.76s]  I don't know how to I don't even know how to react and people give me compliments like this
[13105.92s -> 13107.92s]  because I don't know
[13108.00s -> 13109.76s]  I like sit on the couch
[13109.76s -> 13114.88s]  And like shit my pants and stuff and like don't get up and like then I I I get like fed
[13114.96s -> 13119.34s]  Fed
[13119.34s -> 13121.58s]  None of that's true. None of that's true. I'm just

[13839.18s -> 13843.26s]  Long time watcher first time caller. Have you thought about getting a p.o box that people can send stuff to
[13843.82s -> 13847.10s]  I imagine there's a lot of traditional fan art that people would love to send and share if not
[13847.42s -> 13849.74s]  It'd probably be motivating a lot of people to make some
[13850.22s -> 13854.86s]  There's a few streamers I watch that open their public p.o boxes every week and it's really entertaining
[13855.50s -> 13858.14s]  Uh, love you and give auto a pet from me next time you see them
[13859.48s -> 13864.04s]  I have talked about this a couple times before and unfortunately I have to say no
[13865.36s -> 13867.84s]  P.o boxes because number one they have to be maintained
[13869.10s -> 13871.10s]  I can't i'm so
[13871.34s -> 13877.10s]  Scatterbrained you guys all know that that p.o box would fill up and I would get calls from the post office
[13877.66s -> 13880.86s]  Like can you fucking come down here and pick this shit up?
[13882.09s -> 13884.49s]  Um, whoa shit, right? Okay. Okay. Okay
[13887.48s -> 13891.88s]  and then also there's like the the chances that people send really fucked up stuff and
[13893.92s -> 13896.32s]  Uh, i've thought about it in the past before
[13904.11s -> 13907.23s]  People send terrible shit to yeah, I just
[13908.59s -> 13909.79s]  I mean if
[13909.79s -> 13913.95s]  For for some streamers in some communities like yeah, it's like a fun thing you do and I get it
[13913.95s -> 13915.95s]  I think it's that's like a funny interesting thing to do
[13916.67s -> 13918.75s]  But I am not like ready nor prepared
[13919.39s -> 13921.95s]  To like open up a box and have there be
[13922.67s -> 13924.51s]  Like throw up in it
[13924.51s -> 13928.83s]  Because i'll just be like uh, uh, and i'll like have to i'll have to leave the room and like end the stream
[13937.50s -> 13939.66s]  Yeah, maybe like one day
[13941.36s -> 13945.68s]  But no, I don't even want to like pretend like that would be a reality probably not
[13948.22s -> 13950.78s]  Your viewer base is very wholesome. I can't imagine that happening
[13951.50s -> 13953.10s]  I know but
[13953.10s -> 13956.06s]  Just don't want to have the opportunity for it to be a thing that could happen
[13961.42s -> 13964.62s]  Hold on to it though in the future. Maybe i'll lighten up a little bit about it
[13965.52s -> 13968.56s]  But not now not now not me in the immediate future at all
[13969.12s -> 13983.63s]  But thank you for the one dollar sandrager. Appreciate it. It'd be like five people that actually send like blood
[13984.91s -> 13986.91s]  And ruin it for everybody else
[13992.57s -> 13995.37s]  Yeah, I made like a whole video about getting like blood in the mail
[13995.45s -> 13999.21s]  Are you trying to tell me that you don't think that five of those packages the first day would not be?

[14112.14s -> 14115.66s]  Thank you, sweetie swanky for the one dollar story time when I was seven
[14115.66s -> 14119.82s]  I wanted my dad to make a bird house with me. It was a special time because he was never home
[14120.46s -> 14121.82s]  Being a truck driver
[14121.82s -> 14125.10s]  however, shortly after the bird house was finished, uh, a
[14125.64s -> 14131.02s]  Starling did try to go inside it but the hole was made too small and the bird's head got stuck
[14131.58s -> 14134.72s]  And couldn't get out
[14134.72s -> 14138.64s]  It's only until a week later that my dad had to throw away the bird house
[14140.01s -> 14145.29s]  With the body is still attached and vowed never to make anything with me again. Oh my god
[14148.81s -> 14150.81s]  That's fucking horrible
[14153.93s -> 14162.33s]  Oh no

[14313.58s -> 14317.42s]  Seagull was stuffed inside it like a looney toons character with its beak poking out the front
[14319.77s -> 14322.41s]  No, not right after that last story
[14323.37s -> 14328.49s]  No
[14328.49s -> 14332.81s]  You mean what you mean to say you mean the bird is in the house
[14333.45s -> 14340.22s]  Arms like the wings are sticking out the side beak out the front feet out of the bottom and he's pretending like he can't see me
[14340.54s -> 14342.91s]  And he doesn't think I can see him
[14342.99s -> 14348.24s]  That's the trope you're talking about
[14348.32s -> 14350.32s]  That I would first of all laugh
[14351.29s -> 14353.53s]  And then I would be like I would try to help the bird
[14354.33s -> 14356.33s]  By taking the top off
[14356.78s -> 14358.78s]  I would I would take the top off
[14359.95s -> 14362.09s]  And then the bird would
[14362.09s -> 14363.37s]  And get out
[14363.37s -> 14380.27s]  But this is the looney toons universe. So it would be all right, but thank you for the one dollar

[15048.72s -> 15067.72s]  This guy's fucked
[15067.72s -> 15070.28s]  But for somebody like there's so much fucked up material
[15071.74s -> 15076.38s]  That would be actually embarrassing for me. It happened like two nights ago
[15076.94s -> 15079.82s]  when we were playing edf they're talking about like i'm naked and shit and
[15080.46s -> 15083.98s]  How like i'm an idiot and like it's embarrassing when i'm like naked
[15084.86s -> 15088.06s]  That like if that was on a roast that would be real and it would be actually embarrassing for me
[15102.25s -> 15105.85s]  You never responded about the art showcase. Oh shit. I'm sorry
[15106.99s -> 15108.43s]  Uh, yes
[15108.43s -> 15109.87s]  Yes, yes. Yes
[15109.87s -> 15112.43s]  I think something like that would be very fun
[15112.51s -> 15115.07s]  I know that there's a
[15115.07s -> 15117.07s]  there's a few uh streamers
[15117.63s -> 15122.11s]  That I know of and particularly that do art showcases and it seems really really cool really fun
[15123.16s -> 15126.52s]  Really great way to show off stuff from the community and i'm all about that
[15128.00s -> 15129.77s]  Just not immediately
[15129.77s -> 15131.82s]  Once we get to the new year
[15131.82s -> 15134.06s]  I'm going to sort out a few things to try
[15136.44s -> 15139.18s]  2019 i'm going to come up with a couple of things to do
[15139.90s -> 15144.20s]  For either the end of streams or once a week or once a month
[15145.02s -> 15146.78s]  That we just kind of hang out and do
[15146.78s -> 15155.34s]  Yeah, vinnie does it. Yeah, I think there's there's a few other people that know that actually that do like art streams
[15156.41s -> 15160.36s]  But yeah, Vinnie's been doing it and it's really really cool
[15163.28s -> 15165.28s]  But that's not something I would do
[15166.43s -> 15170.43s]  On like a day to day or a week to week basis. That would be something I'd want to do once in uh
[15171.23s -> 15173.39s]  You know, I feel like once like I said every month or two
[15173.95s -> 15182.36s]  Is it going to be a death of the memes on new year's eve?
[15184.28s -> 15188.16s]  Not this year they get to live
[15188.16s -> 15192.40s]  You saw what happened when I when I killed the memes. They just came back stronger obi-wan style

[15477.56s -> 15479.96s]  So we could meet our esteemed streamer
[15480.76s -> 15482.74s]  I wanted to donate
[15482.74s -> 15487.38s]  5,000 last time but 5,000 bits costs over a hundred fucking dollars
[15488.26s -> 15490.58s]  You deserve it. You're an idol to me and many more. I love you, man
[15492.87s -> 15495.35s]  Holy shit. Why is it? Why is that so much money?

[15501.34s -> 15508.55s]  in australia
[15508.55s -> 15513.03s]  That's an insane
[15513.03s -> 15517.35s]  That's an exchange. That's the exchange rate and like the tax that's fucked up
[15525.19s -> 15527.19s]  but anyways, um
[15527.67s -> 15529.67s]  Yeah, don't worry about that. Don't worry about
[15529.91s -> 15532.47s]  Wanting to give me like a hundred dollars or fifty dollars
[15536.25s -> 15541.16s]  That's not important
[15541.16s -> 15543.16s]  Thank you for even considering it
[15544.34s -> 15549.19s]  But yeah, if I ever decide I mean australia that's a long ways away
[15550.98s -> 15552.98s]  australia is
[15553.00s -> 15556.12s]  That's a trip. That's like a two week long trip
[15558.36s -> 15563.32s]  You can't really just go to australia. Yeah, I live in the u.s. Let's just go to australia for a few days
[15563.80s -> 15565.80s]  I would want to spend at least a couple weeks there
[15565.96s -> 15574.68s]  Maybe one day but if I was going to go there it would have to be for
[15575.24s -> 15578.44s]  I'd want to line it up with at least a couple of particular reasons why I would go
[15579.00s -> 15585.82s]  Three months in a balloon
[15585.82s -> 15587.26s]  But thank you
[15587.26s -> 15589.77s]  That's dog man. Appreciate it

[15616.74s -> 15620.90s]  Thank you s dog man again for the one dollar. Oh, also I use fl studio a lot
[15621.90s -> 15625.82s]  If you need help getting the hang of things message me on the discord or something would love to be able to contribute
[15627.74s -> 15631.88s]  Yeah, there's a lot of talented fucking people and I definitely would
[15632.44s -> 15634.52s]  Before that stream i'd probably hop into a channel
[15635.96s -> 15637.96s]  There's also like I want to make a game
[15639.02s -> 15645.51s]  Design channel on the discord eventually here because I want to see how many people are interested and how many people uh,
[15646.07s -> 15652.94s]  Because i've seen people making games i've seen at least two instances three instances of people making
[15654.07s -> 15657.93s]  playable video games and it's it's fucking really cool, so
[15660.57s -> 15662.57s]  It would be nice to have a place
[15662.57s -> 15670.81s]  For that and somewhere down the line. I would love to I don't know
[15672.01s -> 15673.61s]  I always have trouble
[15673.61s -> 15676.09s]  Saying stuff like this because it's not necessarily true
[15676.41s -> 15681.08s]  But I have a lot of things that i'd like to do a lot of things that interest me have a lot
[15681.08s -> 15683.08s]  Of ideas that i'd like to try to have happen
[15683.83s -> 15689.03s]  Now how many of these things are realities right you watch you watched me over the course of four years
[15689.59s -> 15692.15s]  Talk about how badly I wanted to write something write a book
[15693.35s -> 15697.67s]  I started it. I tried it and every few months i'd be like, yeah i'm trying
[15698.15s -> 15702.39s]  And then like a year went by and it's like I I don't think I can do this and then like a year ago
[15702.39s -> 15706.30s]  It was like um, that's never gonna happen. So
[15707.18s -> 15711.58s]  I don't want to do that anymore. I don't want to be like hey, uh, yeah
[15711.66s -> 15716.38s]  So i'll see you like next year when there's a video game that's released and that I made
[15718.66s -> 15729.22s]  These are ideas that I just want to see if they're possible, but the channel
[15730.36s -> 15731.96s]  on the discord
[15731.96s -> 15733.96s]  Would mainly just be for just general
[15734.52s -> 15736.84s]  game dev talk because a lot of you guys are interested in it, too
[15737.88s -> 15739.48s]  You know, it's not just
[15739.48s -> 15742.76s]  Me that eventually that'd be fun to make a game at some point. Wouldn't it?
[15743.24s -> 15746.04s]  Wouldn't that be like fun to do in like a few years or something, right?
[15747.59s -> 15749.59s]  The bullet hell thing was a game
[15749.75s -> 15752.44s]  There's somebody else working on another game
[15753.80s -> 15757.72s]  Somebody put like made a whole mugen template for me. There's a lot of you guys that are interested
[15757.88s -> 15759.40s]  So it might be fun to do
[15759.40s -> 15761.40s]  To have like a place where you could go talk about it
[15767.90s -> 15770.44s]  But yeah
[15770.44s -> 15772.44s]  Uh getting close to the end here

[15780.57s -> 15783.37s]  Yeah, man, he went ballistic over a bird house. What a boomer

[15788.89s -> 15792.33s]  It still doesn't live up to bill crazy though. I mean, how are you gonna beat him?
[15793.27s -> 15795.27s]  Thank you kairatobi for the one dollar

[16538.02s -> 16541.62s]  I love your streams. Would you care to check out a green screen video I made
[16542.10s -> 16547.40s]  It's called the germinator
[16547.40s -> 16548.84s]  Uh, well
[16548.84s -> 16551.08s]  I did say a while ago that we weren't going to do them
[16551.72s -> 16553.72s]  uh in like bit messages
[16554.12s -> 16555.16s]  but
[16555.16s -> 16558.86s]  I think what i'm going to do I think what i'm going to do
[16560.46s -> 16562.58s]  Is there may be
[16562.58s -> 16569.03s]  There may be a movie night encore and what I mean by that is
[16571.38s -> 16579.00s]  Not like a five or a six hour long stream. We're talking like a end of the stream kind of deal here
[16579.64s -> 16584.89s]  Hey, here's like movie night encore and we're talking like maybe 30 to 40 minutes of
[16585.61s -> 16588.17s]  Other ones that have come in since you know what I mean?
[16596.79s -> 16600.47s]  Because there were a lot of submissions that I've talked about. Hey, it's not just gonna be for one day
[16600.47s -> 16604.62s]  Maybe we'll do it again and we probably will because i've already seen at least a dozen
[16605.34s -> 16607.98s]  That were not on the movie night that were very very good
[16610.30s -> 16612.92s]  Just do it every couple of months
[16612.92s -> 16615.88s]  Yeah, but if we were gonna do it every couple months i'd want to give more material
[16616.36s -> 16619.56s]  because there's only so much you can do with like
[16620.44s -> 16626.25s]  Like a fucking raptor I would need to do more if it's gonna be a regular thing
[16636.25s -> 16638.65s]  Kiwo up to upload of like six already
[16646.22s -> 16649.54s]  That's so funny
[16650.74s -> 16653.19s]  Six
[16653.19s -> 16657.37s]  I actually saw I I actually saw one on twitter. It was fucking funny
[16658.01s -> 16664.66s]  But if I was gonna do more of that, I would want to do more
[16666.65s -> 16668.65s]  So maybe I would do another green screen
[16669.51s -> 16671.48s]  appearance
[16671.48s -> 16679.82s]  Like the green screen bonus pack one thing at a time. I got this christmas stream that I need to get ready
[16680.46s -> 16682.46s]  And one one step at a time
[16684.18s -> 16688.92s]  green screen dlc
[16688.92s -> 16694.52s]  But hopefully that answers your question dark prime. We will probably see it very soon
[16695.00s -> 16699.91s]  Hey superintendent chalmers. Thanks for the one dollar. Hey jeremy. How many bars of soap have you stolen from hotels?
[16700.63s -> 16707.02s]  I know it's a lot hashtag charity. There's no such thing as stealing soap from a hotel. It's free
[16708.31s -> 16710.55s]  They put a bar of soap in there for you to use it and take it
[16712.84s -> 16716.55s]  You're supposed to use that. So

[16734.49s -> 16738.58s]  Hey, uh, can I go one stream without doing that?
[16739.67s -> 16743.43s]  You said it, but I didn't say it everywhere's closed. I just there's no food
[16746.62s -> 16748.62s]  Okay, i'm not allowed to say that tomorrow
[16750.33s -> 16756.57s]  Whisper it well, i'm doing hotline miami too tomorrow. I'm not allowed to say beater tomorrow call me out on it if I do
[16757.05s -> 16760.89s]  Because i'm not going to

[16782.44s -> 16784.44s]  Checkmate jeremy. Oh and hashtag charity
[16788.62s -> 16791.66s]  And never be the one guy if you lurk. Well, you have to be the one guy

[16801.06s -> 16803.29s]  Thank you
[16803.29s -> 16807.69s]  Dark prime again for five dollars. Thank you. I appreciate your streams. Would you care to check out the green screen video?
[16808.33s -> 16810.49s]  I think you might maybe it didn't go through the first time
[16811.13s -> 16813.43s]  Maybe that's ten dollars total here
[16814.66s -> 16819.30s]  Uh, I was late to the party, but I think you'd love it. Hashtag charity. Thank you for putting the hashtag charity there
[16819.70s -> 16822.10s]  Hopefully I answered your question. Hopefully you're still here
[16823.26s -> 16827.26s]  Uh, hold on to that because we will probably put it into a small compilation
[16830.41s -> 16832.41s]  On green screen encore night
[16833.05s -> 16836.73s]  At the end of another stream at some point over the next probably the early 2019
[16837.53s -> 16839.53s]  after the christmas stream
[16839.53s -> 16842.73s]  because that gives some more time for people to get some and we'll do another little thing and
[16843.37s -> 16851.38s]  You hang on to that. Thank you. S dog man again for the one dollar on the bits thing. Yeah
[16851.92s -> 16853.86s]  a udt usd
[16853.86s -> 16856.66s]  Plus gst and I guess there's the online tax
[16857.68s -> 16862.10s]  Entertainment tax shit. Yeah, it's an it's an around the world thing traveling here
[16862.18s -> 16865.70s]  I've wanted to go to america, but likewise, it's a big commitment to make and a lot of travel
[16868.28s -> 16869.48s]  Yeah
[16869.48s -> 16871.48s]  Travels hard no matter how far you go
[16872.31s -> 16874.20s]  You go
[16874.20s -> 16875.77s]  an hour
[16875.77s -> 16877.77s]  You know to another state
[16877.77s -> 16879.43s]  You go

[16884.79s -> 16891.96s]  When I was in massachusetts, that's like a four-hour drive and that like that sucks. It's a long way so
[16893.66s -> 16896.46s]  Any type of travel is stressful, especially going that far
[16897.58s -> 16900.62s]  Five minutes to mcdonald's. Yeah, it's like it's fucking a lot
[16902.66s -> 16904.66s]  I can't mcdonald's just deliver
[16910.04s -> 16914.44s]  but yeah, and it's if you get like on an airplane or you travel by boat or
[16915.74s -> 16917.74s]  More than four or five hours in a car
[16918.38s -> 16922.95s]  It's always a pain in the ass
[16922.95s -> 16927.34s]  Yeah, maybe one day you'll come over
[16927.34s -> 16929.34s]  uber rats what?
[16933.05s -> 16937.29s]  Thank you marty20k again for two dollars. Hey germa985. Where's the ocean?
[16937.93s -> 16939.29s]  the deepest
[16939.29s -> 16942.31s]  At the bottom
[16942.31s -> 16944.87s]  I threw up. I just puked because I read that

[16965.40s -> 16972.04s]  I'm running out of these. I love how you can run out of them
[16972.52s -> 16974.68s]  Like you've had a supply rules, too
[16976.12s -> 16980.28s]  Excuse me. May I see your license? I'm afraid i've left it at home
[16980.76s -> 16984.44s]  In that case, you'll have to take it to the police station within five days
[16984.92s -> 16988.92s]  But why you were speeding ma'am, but I was only doing 75
[16989.24s -> 16994.12s]  There's a 70 kilometer hour speed limit on this road ma'am. Is there I didn't see a sign
[16994.52s -> 16999.00s]  Well, ma'am, we've been following you so you were doing 75 too
[16999.64s -> 17003.72s]  No, ma'am, we were doing 90 kilometers an hour and we couldn't catch you
[17005.08s -> 17008.44s]  Wait traffic 90 kilometers an hour. Isn't that like
[17009.56s -> 17012.84s]  That's like 30 miles per hour. Well, isn't it like 40 miles per hour?
[17020.49s -> 17024.57s]  Boomer can't do math. I don't work in kilometers. I don't work in kilometers
[17026.62s -> 17028.70s]  I work in miles per hour
[17034.70s -> 17037.74s]  Thank you timmy tim tan. Thank you chubby funster for the one dollar. Hey germy you make me laugh
[17037.74s -> 17039.42s]  So I guess you're funny or something
[17039.42s -> 17045.58s]  Trug uh, jess for confirmation your fursona would be a rat, right? I'm sure you'll answer this and not laugh nervously and move on
[17046.06s -> 17048.06s]  from it, uh
[17048.14s -> 17050.30s]  No, hashtag charity. No, my fursona would be
[17051.50s -> 17057.26s]  If I were to have one like an alternate look there's a haven't you seen that spider-man movie where they're all different spider-mans from different spider-man universes
[17057.58s -> 17059.34s]  There's a bunch of you already
[17059.34s -> 17062.62s]  The one germa that is a in a fursuit right now somewhere
[17063.34s -> 17065.34s]  That exists in some alternate timeline
[17065.98s -> 17067.50s]  Is probably
[17067.50s -> 17079.37s]  In a big slippy toad costume this one. No, not this one
[17084.92s -> 17086.44s]  or uh
[17086.44s -> 17089.34s]  I was gonna say goblin
[17089.34s -> 17094.92s]  But that's not a that's not an animal. That is a mythical creature
[17095.40s -> 17099.29s]  Can a goblin be a fursona?
[17099.37s -> 17104.33s]  It can right like a goblin is is that that's that's technically like an otherworldly mythical animal
[17116.18s -> 17118.70s]  Goblins don't have fur
[17118.70s -> 17119.98s]  Who cares?
[17119.98s -> 17126.55s]  Well, that's yeah, that's that's two different alternate timelines
[17127.19s -> 17129.19s]  one of them's a frog one of them's a
[17129.59s -> 17131.59s]  A toad and one of them is a rat
[17131.75s -> 17133.91s]  One of them's a goblin
[17133.91s -> 17135.91s]  One of them is a wolf
[17137.29s -> 17141.69s]  And then in this timeline, it's uh, it's a a leopard so
[17148.10s -> 17154.81s]  Whatever. Okay
[17159.08s -> 17167.48s]  I really gotta like put this to bed one of them is one of them's a human it's this one
[17172.78s -> 17174.78s]  Thank you moist n
[17174.78s -> 17177.58s]  For the one doll i've been watching your youtube videos forever

[17203.30s -> 17207.58s]  Socks rocked confirmed. Hey demonic cucumber. Thanks for the one dollar
[17207.58s -> 17211.02s]  If you don't title the gamer gear stream the bionic boomer
[17217.94s -> 17224.58s]  It's the bionic boomer i'm gonna get one of those eye trackers and track the screen and shit
[17225.30s -> 17228.10s]  I'm gonna be so plugged in there's gonna be so many cords all over me
[17230.92s -> 17233.74s]  Boomer
[17235.98s -> 17237.98s]  I'm gonna look so shitty too
[17238.62s -> 17241.50s]  A heartbeat sensor i'm gonna oh my god
[17242.14s -> 17245.98s]  Don't tell me to do all this. I'm gonna do this like soon
[17247.48s -> 17250.68s]  I'm gonna get so much fucked up shit. I'm gonna get like a virtual boy
[17255.48s -> 17259.72s]  I'm gonna take my blood sugar in the middle of the stream. Although I don't think I can do that
[17261.54s -> 17264.82s]  Can I like take my can I like read my blood sugar in the middle of the stream?
[17264.90s -> 17267.54s]  I don't think i'm I don't think i'd be allowed to do that. That like breaks t. O. S
[17275.59s -> 17277.59s]  What if it was really fucking bad
[17281.21s -> 17283.21s]  Oh by the look it's been long enough
[17283.45s -> 17287.13s]  Can I tell you guys the the thing that I that i'm so pissed off that I didn't get a chance to do
[17288.23s -> 17290.23s]  During the lie detector stream
[17290.94s -> 17293.18s]  So I purchased a bunch of medical shit
[17294.34s -> 17297.62s]  I've bought one of those blood spinning machines
[17298.58s -> 17300.82s]  One of those things where you put all the blood tubes in and it
[17304.47s -> 17306.63s]  I purchased one. I actually fucking bought one
[17307.90s -> 17314.07s]  And the thing I was gonna do is I was going this is too bad. I'm so sad that this didn't happen
[17314.79s -> 17317.91s]  But we were gonna do an elaborate thing me and the doctor
[17318.55s -> 17320.55s]  where every question
[17320.63s -> 17325.27s]  Instead of just asking a question and then like reading and saying oh that was a lie. That wasn't a lie
[17326.23s -> 17328.63s]  He was gonna take up he's gonna drop blood from me
[17329.67s -> 17331.19s]  every question
[17331.19s -> 17333.59s]  So he's gonna ask a question and then draw blood
[17334.15s -> 17338.87s]  Put it in the spinning machine and then put it under a microscope and then determine if it was a lie
[17339.59s -> 17345.51s]  And the whole joke was over the course of the stream. I was gonna be losing so much blood that like okay
[17345.51s -> 17348.55s]  Yeah, it takes a while. We're gonna do like 20 30 questions
[17350.70s -> 17355.66s]  And at the I was gonna like go get like water and come back with like like blue skin
[17356.62s -> 17360.30s]  Like I was getting I was draining all my blood and then I realized
[17361.26s -> 17364.06s]  Um, that's like breaks a lot of rules here
[17368.60s -> 17372.76s]  That would be like I bought like a like a fake syringes and shit and I'm like wait
[17372.76s -> 17374.76s]  I don't I can't do that
[17375.02s -> 17382.97s]  I don't think I can do that
[17382.97s -> 17385.93s]  but I was like laughing my ass off about it me and uh
[17386.97s -> 17389.37s]  The guy that helps me do most of the videos and stuff
[17390.09s -> 17391.53s]  We were just like
[17391.53s -> 17393.93s]  Oh, and the doctor was gonna look up every now and again
[17394.25s -> 17399.77s]  He's gonna look through the microscope and be like, ah, this is the most full of shit blood i've ever seen in my life
[17401.72s -> 17404.92s]  Like how why would you need that to determine if it's a lie or not?
[17409.14s -> 17411.14s]  There you go. There's that's uh
[17411.30s -> 17415.86s]  There's some insight on on that stream. I couldn't do the
[17416.58s -> 17420.58s]  draw blood from me until I like am fucking turning into
[17421.38s -> 17423.06s]  like I was gonna be like
[17423.14s -> 17427.94s]  Falling asleep and shit and he's gonna be like waking me up to ask more questions and draw more blood
[17429.94s -> 17432.98s]  And then we were like, no, I think that might I think that's a little too much
[17433.62s -> 17444.95s]  I'm gonna need a piss sample
[17445.51s -> 17454.54s]  Because we were trying to think of like ways that if you took a lie detector
[17456.20s -> 17458.20s]  What would you not ever have to do?
[17463.98s -> 17468.62s]  But yeah, that was that was part of one of the ideas that just never ended up and I still I fucking
[17468.62s -> 17470.79s]  Had the machine up until I moved
[17470.87s -> 17474.15s]  I was trying to think about some another way to use that machine
[17474.71s -> 17476.71s]  And I couldn't it was just not enough time
[17485.99s -> 17489.67s]  No, he wasn't really gonna be drawing any blood from me. It was gonna be all fake
[17500.94s -> 17505.42s]  How much did it cost? It wasn't that expensive because I don't know somebody was like getting rid of it weirdly enough
[17512.02s -> 17514.02s]  Bionic boomer we have the technology
[17516.62s -> 17519.82s]  Yeah, now that I think about it. What the fuck was all that shit?
[17525.78s -> 17529.70s]  How much was it? I I I I I can't say
[17530.50s -> 17532.84s]  I can't say
[17532.84s -> 17535.11s]  What can I say?
[17535.11s -> 17539.83s]  I don't still have it. I'm not gonna look there was only a certain amount of stuff I could put
[17540.63s -> 17542.95s]  In and when I when I moved right?
[17543.67s -> 17546.07s]  So when I was like stuffing up boxes and shit
[17546.63s -> 17551.51s]  The big spinning blood machine is not something that it was a priority to bring to vegas
[17558.50s -> 17560.57s]  How do you come up with this stuff?
[17560.57s -> 17565.88s]  I don't know
[17565.88s -> 17569.56s]  You still took the machinima shot glass. Um, excuse me
[17570.28s -> 17573.24s]  Uh, the machinima shot glass is like an inch tall
[17574.25s -> 17582.01s]  The blood machine was a fucking huge machine. It was giant. It was a big heavy clunky machine that made a loud noise
[17588.86s -> 17594.09s]  All right. Let's finish this up
[17594.09s -> 17596.97s]  But uh look forward. I look forward to the bionic boomer stream
[17599.08s -> 17601.37s]  Put it on the list
[17601.37s -> 17607.94s]  Thank you. Uh, lulamore for the one dollar found you on your old layers of fear youtube stream

[17631.27s -> 17634.31s]  I was desperately trying to keep my cool and not look like a weirdo
[17635.11s -> 17637.67s]  But how do you keep your cool when something like that's happening? I don't know
[17642.95s -> 17644.95s]  Back when I had short hair. Yeah
[17650.70s -> 17653.51s]  But thank you lulamore, uh

[17696.74s -> 17699.22s]  Not the mall in the in the back of an airplane
[17700.82s -> 17708.74s]  The sky mall
[17708.74s -> 17711.06s]  It's going to be all it is going to be a joke
[17711.78s -> 17714.18s]  If you think that the birdhouse stream was just like oh he
[17714.90s -> 17718.74s]  So like somebody said look at these pants and hey build a birdhouse
[17719.22s -> 17721.40s]  This is gonna i'm taking this to 100 now
[17722.62s -> 17726.14s]  The bionic boomer is going to it's gonna happen and i'm going to be decked out
[17726.78s -> 17727.82s]  head
[17727.82s -> 17729.02s]  To toe

[17734.22s -> 17736.22s]  It's gonna take hours to go through them all
[17743.16s -> 17745.16s]  bionic boomer
[17747.26s -> 17753.42s]  I'm gonna attach you know those little claws those like robotic hands like those things that you can reach up like grandma users to grab
[17753.50s -> 17754.70s]  stuff
[17754.70s -> 17756.70s]  We're gonna like pour a drink
[17757.21s -> 17760.09s]  I'm gonna have a robot on me like moving an arm and shit
[17775.06s -> 17777.30s]  Oh spill drink joke incoming

[17805.54s -> 17808.06s]  No more bits
[17808.06s -> 17810.14s]  Uh, no more bits anyways because the stream is pretty much over
[17810.86s -> 17813.26s]  But thank you marty20k for the five dollars
[17814.30s -> 17821.96s]  And no more drunk bits. Okay, if you spill a drink on the bionic boomer, he dies
[17825.72s -> 17827.80s]  I actually want it to be hard to move
[17829.05s -> 17831.05s]  Is it gonna take like i'm gonna need help here
[17831.77s -> 17836.57s]  I'm going to make an elaborate suit that is going to be physically difficult for me to actually move
[17839.13s -> 17841.13s]  It's gonna it's gonna be very hard
[17847.13s -> 17851.37s]  Thank you, uh wind thank you wind windar for the one dollar
[17852.01s -> 17855.77s]  If we do a movie night encore will there be limitations on what we watch?
[17856.41s -> 17862.41s]  Like is it possible to avoid 15 to 20 vids of jojo stuff? They're fun to watch but they took up a lot of
[17862.97s -> 17865.66s]  uh the first movie night
[17865.90s -> 17868.07s]  I would probably say
[17868.07s -> 17869.75s]  It would be
[17869.75s -> 17871.99s]  um
[17871.99s -> 17873.51s]  I don't know. I don't know
[17873.51s -> 17875.91s]  I can't really I can't say
[17877.11s -> 17878.60s]  because
[17878.60s -> 17881.40s]  I haven't thought too much about it until right now
[17882.14s -> 17887.34s]  So I don't want to give rules and guidelines on something that I haven't even personally thought about yet. So
[17890.23s -> 17894.63s]  Uh, we'll talk about that at a later date when I can get a more clear idea of what I would like to do
[17897.54s -> 17899.61s]  But we'll see
[17899.61s -> 17901.13s]  and then finally, uh
[17901.21s -> 17905.93s]  Solomon the squid thanks for the two dollars. Hey, germa love the stream was wondering if you ever had made progress on that book
[17906.01s -> 17907.99s]  You said you were writing it you're back
[17907.99s -> 17911.93s]  It's no big deal to me if you decided to cut it all together or put it on hold
[17913.21s -> 17919.91s]  Uh, I just wanted to know if there was any cool details you'd like to share on it. Well
[17920.87s -> 17922.44s]  uh
[17922.44s -> 17925.46s]  I actually uh, i've talked about the book
[17926.98s -> 17931.22s]  Not only tonight, but I put the can on it probably like a year or two ago
[17932.55s -> 17938.30s]  Remember we were streaming. I don't know what we were playing but I like actually put the nail in the coffin
[17939.00s -> 17948.78s]  Like a couple years ago, didn't I it was gonna be a choose your own adventure book of rote with this engine that I was
[17949.18s -> 17957.61s]  Learning tell this the end of the book now that it's dead. How far did it get?
[17958.63s -> 17964.58s]  I didn't I copy and pasted like a bunch of shit in here. Remember that was how long how many you guys were here
[17964.66s -> 17967.16s]  For that I copy and pasted
[17967.64s -> 17975.99s]  Probably like 1500 words in here. Was it twine? It was not twine. It was the it was the ink
[17976.71s -> 17977.75s]  the
[17977.75s -> 17995.61s]  Inkling writer, no, they were not inkling the ink ankle ankle writer. What is this? What are you guys doing?
[18000.84s -> 18005.56s]  Weren't there like a dozen pages that got pasted? Yeah, I just like copy and pasted all the shit that was there
[18007.56s -> 18012.81s]  Oh, okay
[18012.81s -> 18018.09s]  But that's it talked about it. I i'm surprised that people were asking about it
[18018.65s -> 18020.89s]  Was anybody asking about it? Did I just go off?
[18021.86s -> 18025.30s]  Because I thought I did kind of put the nail in it like a year or two ago
[18027.91s -> 18038.78s]  When I copy and pasted everything because we like your stuff. Oh, okay
[18039.34s -> 18048.12s]  It was a lot of fun to try to make but here's the next part of this that needs to be addressed
[18049.98s -> 18052.70s]  To do something like that you that's what you have to do
[18053.42s -> 18054.95s]  You know what I mean?
[18054.95s -> 18058.23s]  I can't like unless I like wrote that book on stream
[18059.45s -> 18063.37s]  It would never get done because that's what what am I doing? That's what i'm doing right now, you know
[18063.77s -> 18065.77s]  There's only so much time in a day
[18066.09s -> 18068.09s]  Where if you focus on something
[18068.49s -> 18075.08s]  That's kind of what you're focusing on
[18075.16s -> 18077.16s]  stream making an adventure book
[18077.40s -> 18083.56s]  Yeah, but I don't that's as much as everybody says that that's something fun to do I I don't work well that way
[18085.11s -> 18090.15s]  I have to be like silent just staring at a screen when I come up with something that I want to try or write or
[18091.64s -> 18093.72s]  Talk, you know like uh when I came up with like, you know
[18093.72s -> 18097.24s]  They're getting blood taken from me and putting the uh in the spinning machine for the lie detector
[18097.24s -> 18105.30s]  I mean I was silent just staring at the screen
[18105.46s -> 18107.86s]  Smart click so you guys write it for me
[18110.49s -> 18112.33s]  No
[18112.33s -> 18113.77s]  Anyways, that is going to be it
[18113.77s -> 18118.17s]  We got a few more here moo means moo one dollar lego's bionicle boomer the mask of light

[18124.98s -> 18130.74s]  And for some strange reason I watched like five ads and didn't get any bits for them which caused this message to get delayed

[18135.54s -> 18138.98s]  And i'm looking forward to future streams and future biomic bionic booming
