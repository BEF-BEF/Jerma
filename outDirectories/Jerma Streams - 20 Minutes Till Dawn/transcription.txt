[7.03s -> 9.53s]  What about Rumbleverse? I've heard of it, but I haven't played it.
[9.53s -> 18.52s]  Alright, what's it called? 20 minutes? Is it on Steam?
[18.52s -> 24.85s]  20 minutes till dawn. Okay. Early access.
[24.85s -> 31.09s]  This is also $3! Vampire Survivors is $3 too, isn't it? Or $2?
[31.09s -> 39.46s]  That's interesting. Okay.
[39.46s -> 45.43s]  Uh, stream might have an issue here, because I'm about to be sick.
[45.43s -> 55.68s]  I'm downloading a game right now, so the stream might, like, die. Are we good?
[55.68s -> 67.54s]  Rumbleverse is fun. This game's 100 megabytes. Damn.
[67.54s -> 71.06s]  Okay, let's see how it is.
[80.36s -> 96.97s]  20 minutes till dawn. How about? Stop!
[96.97s -> 109.47s]  Yeah, 100 megabytes.
[109.47s -> 116.68s]  Dude, I don't even need to change the name of the title.
[116.68s -> 124.26s]  Trying out this new game, right?
[124.26s -> 128.08s]  Alright, how are the options? Is this a controller game?
[128.08s -> 140.33s]  Thank you. I can turn that off.
[140.33s -> 150.26s]  Should I do controller, or should I do mouse and keyboard?
[150.26s -> 151.36s]  Controller? Okay.
[151.36s -> 153.86s]  This is the only character that I have. Standard mode, endless mode.
[153.86s -> 157.61s]  Standard mode. Ten minutes survival. Alright.
[157.61s -> 164.96s]  20 minutes? Standard mode. Yeah.
[164.96s -> 170.46s]  Okay. Flip to shoot. It's a right trigger to shoot.
[170.46s -> 173.44s]  I actually would probably prefer mouse and keyboard.
[173.44s -> 177.12s]  Yeah, definitely. Oh yeah, without a doubt. Hold on.
[177.12s -> 194.44s]  I need to turn the sensitivity down. Can I turn the sensitivity down?
[194.44s -> 205.79s]  Auto-aim. Oh, okay.
[205.79s -> 216.75s]  This is fun. Choose an upgrade. Double shot?
[216.75s -> 222.87s]  Dark arts. Ooh, it's like a crit.
[222.87s -> 232.34s]  Bullet speed? Max vitality? Ghost friend. Ghost friend.
[232.34s -> 235.75s]  This is a full-on genre now.
[235.75s -> 240.85s]  That actually makes me really happy, because Vampire Survivors is so fucking fun.
[240.85s -> 245.75s]  This type of game is so fun. I hope these guys make millions of dollars
[245.75s -> 249.15s]  setting this genre. Right?
[249.15s -> 252.77s]  I hope they make millions of dollars.
[252.77s -> 255.27s]  And then it's like, okay, a bunch of people are making games that are like this too,
[255.27s -> 259.97s]  but that's alright. You got a huge bag.
[259.97s -> 263.77s]  Alright, I hope they make a lot of money.
[263.77s -> 271.68s]  This game is called Garlic Likes. Really?
[271.68s -> 286.45s]  I like that. Rapid fire. Let's go.
[286.45s -> 290.04s]  Oh fuck, I'm gonna die. I'm dead. I'm not.
[290.04s -> 291.44s]  Alright, hold on.
[291.44s -> 296.71s]  Energetic friends. Summon attack speed plus 50%. That sounds good.
[296.71s -> 303.15s]  Oh, I see. And it also unlocks stuff. Dragon egg?
[303.15s -> 324.14s]  Oh, fuck yeah. This thing hatches into a dragon in three minutes.
[324.14s -> 327.47s]  Fuck, I'm dead. This game is awesome. Shit.
[327.47s -> 330.55s]  Okay, this game is cool.
[330.55s -> 341.59s]  Okay, let's do it again. Let's do it again. This game is fun.
[341.59s -> 360.00s]  So, it's two hits. Move speed is essential.
[360.00s -> 368.13s]  It feels like it, yeah, because there's not really any reliable way to get away.
[368.13s -> 370.83s]  Are there upgrades in this game afterwards? Yes, there is.
[370.83s -> 373.26s]  Oh my God, I love this game.
[373.26s -> 374.46s]  The other one was good too, but this one feels...
[374.46s -> 376.32s]  Okay, here's the thing.
[376.32s -> 379.06s]  The difference between the last game and this one
[379.06s -> 382.49s]  is from the very beginning of that last one that we just played,
[382.49s -> 387.49s]  I felt just powerful. I was so powerful almost already.
[387.49s -> 392.10s]  I was just destroying everything. I just got my ass kicked.
[392.10s -> 394.96s]  I didn't even make it five minutes.
[394.96s -> 397.42s]  I like that better.
[397.42s -> 401.43s]  I like the game needs to really progress, progress, progress, progress
[401.43s -> 405.42s]  until you get to that point where it's just crazy.
[405.42s -> 410.86s]  It almost gives you an opportunity to learn the game better.
[410.86s -> 413.43s]  Alright, let's see. Reload rate, fire rate, yeah.
[413.43s -> 423.08s]  Wait, no, let me see everything else.
[423.08s -> 434.94s]  I think I like this one.
[434.94s -> 437.85s]  Vampire survivors get a lot more difficult as you progressed.
[438.25s -> 443.11s]  Yeah, I did. I shoot the tree.
[443.11s -> 450.21s]  Oh, all right.
[450.21s -> 459.50s]  Pick up range is always good. That's a good.
[459.50s -> 478.32s]  Oh, should I just do super reload, Andy?
[478.32s -> 481.62s]  I do appreciate you can see the ammo on the cursor.
[481.62s -> 497.26s]  That's huge.
[497.26s -> 504.59s]  I got to collect some shit here, otherwise I'm going to be in trouble.
[504.59s -> 509.05s]  All right, double shot sounds good with this.
[509.05s -> 516.21s]  Oh, move speed, but didn't you guys say this is important?
[516.21s -> 521.86s]  I probably should do it.
[521.86s -> 532.81s]  I'm already starting to slow down. Yeah, I'll do it.
[532.81s -> 534.01s]  That's definitely a huge increase.
[534.01s -> 547.14s]  Yeah, this is much better.
[547.14s -> 551.44s]  When are you going to unbox an Xbox One?
[551.44s -> 555.52s]  No, that's actually really funny.
[555.52s -> 565.10s]  I do an Xbox One unboxing video like the Halo edition with faster cheap on it.
[565.10s -> 566.30s]  Right. That would be actually pretty funny.
[566.30s -> 575.21s]  I'm into that. Wow.
[575.21s -> 577.21s]  Am I going am I going super fast right now?
[577.21s -> 617.42s]  Oh shit, I want it to be a lot of help.
[617.42s -> 638.64s]  Oh, is that I like the setup.
[638.64s -> 641.75s]  I like the build.
[641.75s -> 643.85s]  Oh, all right. I got to get some of that.
[643.85s -> 656.08s]  All right. Time to collect.
[656.08s -> 661.49s]  It's simple. Yeah, it is simple, but that's a good thing.
[661.49s -> 663.86s]  I think I'm doing double shot.
[663.86s -> 678.24s]  Yeah, a little damage, but I think that's fine.
[678.24s -> 684.87s]  All right. Let's really start to snowball here.
[684.87s -> 692.69s]  HP. Increase bullet damage and move speed by 10 percent every 10 seconds.
[692.69s -> 694.70s]  This resets when you get hit.
[694.70s -> 696.54s]  Oh my God. That's actually huge.
[696.54s -> 721.45s]  40 percent. I just don't get hit.
[721.45s -> 725.82s]  There we go. That's what I wanted.
[725.82s -> 730.03s]  Don't get greedy. I got greedy.
[730.03s -> 732.33s]  Your dragon gains 8 damage every 60 seconds.
[732.33s -> 735.65s]  This ability works even if your dragon is still in the egg.
[735.65s -> 743.05s]  Egg salad. Increase reload rate by 5 percent for every enemy killed.
[743.05s -> 748.06s]  That's okay. That's kind of cool.
[748.06s -> 749.95s]  That's kind of cool.
[749.95s -> 753.30s]  Should I just I think I'm going to go for the dragon.
[753.30s -> 755.37s]  It's going to stay alive.
[755.37s -> 770.80s]  Oh shit, I'm going to die.
[770.80s -> 800.16s]  I got to focus. No more talking.
[800.16s -> 801.36s]  What the fuck is that?
[801.36s -> 810.51s]  All right. Holy shield. Health.
[810.51s -> 821.15s]  I think I need this. I got one health.
[821.15s -> 833.45s]  Ooh. Enemies within your vision range take 25 damage every two seconds.
[833.45s -> 839.80s]  I got to stay alive though.
[839.80s -> 842.40s]  Re-halo pieces can now appear as upgrade choices.
[842.40s -> 847.02s]  Collect all three to recover Shauna's halo.
[847.02s -> 850.68s]  Okay. Is something else in there?
[850.68s -> 851.78s]  Oh my God.
[851.78s -> 853.68s]  Okay. That was... I died.
[853.68s -> 860.73s]  Shit. All right. That was fun.
[860.73s -> 873.47s]  Let's go. Get the upgrades of the main menu.
[873.47s -> 882.03s]  I'll do one more and then we'll go there.
[882.03s -> 884.98s]  Fuck. I really like this.
[884.98s -> 886.08s]  When did this come out?
[886.08s -> 897.17s]  A couple months ago?
[897.17s -> 904.34s]  Why did it take me so long to understand that it existed?
[904.34s -> 907.44s]  I got 20 in the recommended Discord channel.
[907.44s -> 911.19s]  20 play Freddy fish 3.
[911.19s -> 917.08s]  Oh no. No play this one?
[917.08s -> 918.58s]  I think we're going electro.
[918.58s -> 923.33s]  Let's try it. Every second shot.
[923.33s -> 937.28s]  That's awesome.
[937.28s -> 938.98s]  All right. Magic lens.
[938.98s -> 940.94s]  Quick hands.
[940.94s -> 942.64s]  Let's go with the health right off the bat.
[942.64s -> 947.94s]  This is the one. This is the run.
[947.94s -> 953.70s]  We're going to get to at least 15 minutes or 10 minutes.
[953.80s -> 963.78s]  I need some rapid fire though so the lightning happens more often.
[963.78s -> 982.16s]  Dumb ass.
[982.16s -> 984.77s]  All right. Give me something good.
[984.77s -> 988.07s]  Max HP plus 2. Character size plus 50%.
[988.07s -> 991.76s]  I don't know if I like that.
[991.76s -> 995.16s]  Ooh. Egg. No.
[995.16s -> 1002.04s]  I want lightning.
[1002.04s -> 1003.04s]  Okay. When lightning strikes an enemy,
[1003.04s -> 1005.34s]  there's a 20% chance to automatically refill three ammo.
[1005.34s -> 1012.14s]  Let's do it.
[1012.14s -> 1017.42s]  I wonder how often that's going to happen.
[1017.42s -> 1021.04s]  Hasn't happened yet.
[1021.04s -> 1040.94s]  There we go. It's pretty good.
[1040.94s -> 1044.70s]  That's good, but I need reload speed.
[1044.70s -> 1050.93s]  Summon an electro bug that calls down lightning to strike two nearby enemies.
[1050.93s -> 1058.94s]  Rapid fire or electro bug? Let's do it.
[1058.94s -> 1060.84s]  That's good that it just passively does that.
[1060.84s -> 1081.32s]  Ooh. Power shot. Nice.
[1081.32s -> 1084.11s]  All lightning damage increased by 12.
[1084.11s -> 1086.41s]  Increased lightning area effect by 75%.
[1086.41s -> 1089.00s]  Yeah. Lightning build.
[1089.00s -> 1094.78s]  Let's do it.
[1094.78s -> 1111.97s]  Now I need rapid fire and more ammo.
[1111.97s -> 1112.67s]  Double shot.
[1112.67s -> 1116.93s]  Ooh. Yep.
[1116.93s -> 1118.63s]  Does that count as two?
[1118.63s -> 1122.30s]  It does, right?
[1122.30s -> 1138.95s]  Oh, it doesn't count as two.
[1138.95s -> 1142.43s]  I think it's that one.
[1142.43s -> 1144.14s]  Yeah. I need the movement speed.
[1144.14s -> 1162.63s]  Plus the fire rate.
[1162.63s -> 1165.85s]  Thank you.
[1165.85s -> 1169.17s]  Three halo pieces can now appear.
[1169.17s -> 1171.26s]  Take it.
[1171.26s -> 1173.44s]  Dude, what the fuck just happened?
[1173.44s -> 1174.74s]  That's got bounced around like crazy.
[1174.74s -> 1176.14s]  Bullet speed.
[1176.14s -> 1180.82s]  Fire rate. That's what I want.
[1180.82s -> 1186.12s]  Oh, yeah.
[1186.12s -> 1188.42s]  All right. As long as I don't act like a bonehead,
[1188.42s -> 1209.96s]  I should be fine here.
[1209.96s -> 1214.76s]  Ooh. Ooh.
[1214.76s -> 1217.85s]  Does this count?
[1217.85s -> 1222.15s]  It's not fun when Jerma is not being stupid.
[1222.15s -> 1226.12s]  Man, we're just sometimes just chilling, dude.
[1226.12s -> 1229.92s]  Dude, if you step on the gas and you go 100 miles per hour the whole time,
[1229.92s -> 1235.01s]  you're going to run out of gas and the car is going to break down.
[1235.01s -> 1235.81s]  You got your car.
[1235.81s -> 1242.88s]  You need to refuel sometimes.
[1242.88s -> 1245.28s]  Magnet's good.
[1245.28s -> 1265.96s]  Yeah. It's a good choice.
[1265.96s -> 1277.71s]  Yeah. You don't want the car to run out of gas.
[1277.71s -> 1279.41s]  How many times have you said gas today?
[1279.41s -> 1282.96s]  At least 10.
[1282.96s -> 1284.26s]  All right. I want that.
[1284.26s -> 1302.28s]  Or what is the is the vision rain this big circle around me?
[1302.28s -> 1304.46s]  Were you ever come to Pittsburgh?
[1304.46s -> 1306.36s]  Dude, I was there yesterday.
[1306.36s -> 1307.26s]  I was there yesterday.
[1307.26s -> 1308.76s]  I got a fucking steak of cheese.
[1308.76s -> 1315.50s]  I got a Philly cheesesteak.
[1315.50s -> 1330.81s]  You missed me by like four hours.
[1330.81s -> 1332.93s]  Wrong city.
[1332.93s -> 1336.83s]  Well, you don't think that they have cheap like famous cheese steaks
[1336.83s -> 1340.48s]  in any other cities in that state?
[1340.48s -> 1346.00s]  Well, you think it's only exclusive to Philly?
[1346.00s -> 1347.20s]  They do, but they suck.
[1347.20s -> 1354.54s]  What?
[1362.20s -> 1367.76s]  Are we this one?
[1367.76s -> 1372.99s]  You called it a Philly cheesesteak.
[1372.99s -> 1375.19s]  If I order a New York style pizza,
[1375.19s -> 1378.46s]  the person behind the counter is not going to go.
[1378.46s -> 1384.52s]  Hey, you know, this is Buffalo.
[1384.52s -> 1385.62s]  Oh, no, no, no. Sorry.
[1385.62s -> 1389.58s]  Hey, you know, you know, you're in Cincinnati, dude.
[1389.58s -> 1390.98s]  If it's in New York style pizza,
[1390.98s -> 1393.33s]  New York City style pizza.
[1393.33s -> 1394.43s]  You're an idiot.
[1394.43s -> 1395.73s]  You don't even know what city you're in.
[1395.73s -> 1405.00s]  I just fucking lost because of that.
[1405.00s -> 1413.54s]  Oh, my eye.
[1413.54s -> 1415.04s]  That was such a good run too.
[1415.04s -> 1427.38s]  Man that person for seven days.
[1427.38s -> 1428.98s]  Philly cheese rant.
[1428.98s -> 1430.98s]  Yeah, if you make a Philly cheese, dude,
[1430.98s -> 1433.28s]  you can't just be like, oh, hey.
[1433.28s -> 1434.28s]  Oh, hey, grandpa.
[1434.28s -> 1434.78s]  How are you?
[1434.78s -> 1436.18s]  I'm doing very good.
[1436.18s -> 1436.68s]  Oh, man.
[1436.68s -> 1439.98s]  Hey, are you going to make me your famous Philly cheesesteak?
[1439.98s -> 1441.78s]  Yes, I'm going to make you a Philly cheesesteak.
[1441.78s -> 1444.15s]  I know how to make it really good.
[1444.15s -> 1446.67s]  Did you even grow up in Philadelphia?
[1446.67s -> 1447.47s]  No, I didn't.
[1447.47s -> 1449.87s]  I just know how to make them really good.
[1449.87s -> 1451.67s]  And I have family there.
[1451.67s -> 1454.52s]  Did you grow up in Philly?
[1454.52s -> 1455.42s]  No, I'm sorry.
[1455.42s -> 1456.32s]  I didn't mean to.
[1456.32s -> 1457.12s]  Is it Otto?
[1457.12s -> 1463.84s]  No, it's not.
[1463.84s -> 1471.93s]  Cheese steak gatekeeping.
[1472.03s -> 1497.00s]  All right, I want to do something cool like this.
[1497.00s -> 1499.64s]  I got a famous salmon I'd like to make.
[1499.64s -> 1503.96s]  I got a famous egg salad I want to make for you.
[1503.96s -> 1510.43s]  What was even your eggs?
[1510.43s -> 1528.56s]  I'm sorry.
[1528.56s -> 1536.06s]  All right, I'm going to pay attention.
[1536.06s -> 1538.88s]  Remember, that's disgusting.
[1538.88s -> 1543.66s]  Well, that's kind of something.
[1543.66s -> 1549.29s]  Ooh, I like that.
[1549.29s -> 1574.86s]  But this synergizes better.
[1574.86s -> 1575.96s]  All right, more, more, more.
[1575.96s -> 1577.24s]  Should I go for the egg?
[1577.24s -> 1579.08s]  All right, I'm actually going to go for the egg
[1579.08s -> 1614.44s]  and not be a moron.
[1614.44s -> 1616.72s]  We're good?
[1616.72s -> 1620.20s]  All right, I think I can comfortably.
[1620.20s -> 1632.54s]  Yeah, that one.
[1632.54s -> 1645.90s]  Whoa, tree.
[1645.90s -> 1647.10s]  Damage 35%.
[1647.10s -> 1649.77s]  Yep, we're going straight up.
[1649.77s -> 1679.88s]  Just bullet damage.
[1679.88s -> 1680.78s]  Bullet bounce?
[1680.78s -> 1685.60s]  All right, I got to think about going somewhere else.
[1685.60s -> 1687.80s]  So it will bounce off of people.
[1687.80s -> 1691.76s]  Hey, I've been performing some rituals on you
[1691.76s -> 1693.46s]  and just wanted to know if you still had 10 toes.
[1693.46s -> 1696.64s]  Yes, I do.
[1696.64s -> 1700.54s]  Please do a ritual where I have a healthy life and shit.
[1700.54s -> 1705.05s]  Come on, do some rituals where I learn
[1705.05s -> 1707.55s]  how to figure your skate or ice skate or something.
[1707.55s -> 1708.35s]  Something interesting.
[1708.35s -> 1710.20s]  Let me do something cool.
[1710.20s -> 1712.00s]  Stop removing toes and shit.
[1712.00s -> 1714.50s]  Stop.
[1714.50s -> 1716.70s]  Next time you're at the altar or whatever it is,
[1716.70s -> 1719.36s]  just be like, you know what?
[1719.36s -> 1720.76s]  Let's make something cool.
[1720.76s -> 1721.86s]  Let's do something.
[1721.86s -> 1725.98s]  Maybe he eats a really good piece of pizza tomorrow or something.
[1725.98s -> 1728.75s]  Come on.
[1728.75s -> 1730.35s]  Enough of this bullshit.
[1730.35s -> 1744.08s]  Enough of the bullshit.
[1744.08s -> 1748.47s]  Don't go over there.
[1748.47s -> 1750.33s]  Gun mastery.
[1750.33s -> 1753.16s]  Wait, did I just?
[1753.16s -> 1755.62s]  All right, yeah.
[1755.62s -> 1760.33s]  That sounds pretty amazing.
[1760.33s -> 1771.13s]  This is actually the run, so I'm not going to blow it.
[1771.13s -> 1771.93s]  Quick learner.
[1771.93s -> 1773.83s]  Increase experience gain by 40%.
[1773.83s -> 1775.38s]  Yep.
[1775.38s -> 1776.88s]  OK, that's where.
[1776.88s -> 1781.15s]  All right.
[1781.15s -> 1783.15s]  Really?
[1783.15s -> 1800.43s]  Oh, the dragon's coming out soon, right?
[1800.53s -> 1805.13s]  That experience thing is insane.
[1805.13s -> 1806.43s]  Reload rate, 5%.
[1806.43s -> 1811.98s]  Bullet damage by 50% for one second after reloading.
[1811.98s -> 1814.72s]  Reload rate by 5% for every enemy killed.
[1814.72s -> 1816.02s]  This resets after reloading.
[1816.02s -> 1818.32s]  No, we'll do this one.
[1818.32s -> 1837.38s]  Yeah.
[1837.38s -> 1838.76s]  Yep.
[1838.76s -> 1840.12s]  OK.
[1840.12s -> 1841.12s]  Dragon.
[1841.12s -> 1842.42s]  Bullet speed.
[1842.42s -> 1844.72s]  Ghost friend.
[1844.72s -> 1848.85s]  Dragon bond.
[1848.85s -> 1851.10s]  This one.
[1851.10s -> 1865.28s]  Dragon does more damage, even when he's in the egg.
[1865.28s -> 1875.45s]  Did he actually kill the trees, or is that just a waste of time?
[1875.45s -> 1887.25s]  Jesus.
[1887.25s -> 1888.05s]  Whoa.
[1888.05s -> 1894.51s]  OK, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[1894.51s -> 1898.23s]  Damage 45% and huge size.
[1898.33s -> 1902.06s]  Yes.
[1902.06s -> 1902.56s]  Fuck.
[1902.56s -> 1908.35s]  All right, this is getting hard.
[1908.35s -> 1911.04s]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[1911.04s -> 1916.80s]  Choose an upgrade.
[1916.80s -> 1919.55s]  Bullet damage minus 50%.
[1919.55s -> 1922.55s]  But burn, lightning, and freeze duration by 30%.
[1922.55s -> 1923.85s]  I don't have any of that.
[1923.85s -> 1925.35s]  Summon damage by 50%.
[1925.35s -> 1929.22s]  Summon attack speed, but my reload rate is awful.
[1929.22s -> 1930.72s]  Forward bullet damage, bullet su-
[1930.72s -> 1932.69s]  Yeah, it's got to be this one, right?
[1932.69s -> 1933.39s]  Max HP.
[1933.39s -> 1940.58s]  Is that going to kill me?
[1940.58s -> 1941.48s]  This one will kill me?
[1941.48s -> 1949.83s]  I think that was the right call.
[1949.83s -> 1960.27s]  This is ridiculous.
[1960.27s -> 1963.78s]  Is the area getting smaller?
[1963.78s -> 1972.74s]  I'm not getting fortnighted, am I?
[1972.74s -> 1981.40s]  Definitely this one.
[1981.40s -> 1982.30s]  What is causing that?
[1982.30s -> 2000.66s]  Can I stop it?
[2000.66s -> 2017.25s]  I'm really glad their enemy projectiles are red.
[2017.25s -> 2020.39s]  Movement speed.
[2020.39s -> 2028.14s]  Uh, I don't know.
[2028.14s -> 2029.77s]  Probably this one.
[2029.77s -> 2040.25s]  Just more, more piercing with damage.
[2040.25s -> 2069.18s]  Oh, that was close.
[2069.18s -> 2081.32s]  No.
[2081.32s -> 2085.25s]  I think I need to take it.
[2085.25s -> 2105.65s]  I do.
[2105.65s -> 2107.55s]  I got so much shit over there to go pick up.
[2107.55s -> 2121.00s]  Let's run them over here.
[2121.00s -> 2133.34s]  All right, pick up.
[2133.34s -> 2136.66s]  Enemies explode into three bullets when killed.
[2136.66s -> 2144.58s]  Huge.
[2144.58s -> 2145.78s]  That's good too, though.
[2145.78s -> 2149.18s]  I'm going to do this.
[2149.18s -> 2155.37s]  They explode when killed and does 10% damage.
[2155.37s -> 2156.97s]  Holy shit, that's unbelievable.
[2156.97s -> 2170.03s]  All right, just don't blow it.
[2170.03s -> 2178.48s]  There's so many bullets everywhere.
[2178.48s -> 2179.98s]  So I got a question.
[2179.98s -> 2183.39s]  Does this include...
[2183.39s -> 2185.94s]  Way too dank?
[2185.94s -> 2194.76s]  Uh, does that count for the little bullets that are coming out from the explosion?
[2194.76s -> 2195.94s]  It does?
[2195.94s -> 2198.22s]  Okay, that sounds kind of crazy.
[2198.22s -> 2212.91s]  Uh, yeah.
[2212.91s -> 2215.72s]  Jesus.
[2215.72s -> 2219.58s]  When shooting your last ammo, also shoot 10 bullets in a circle.
[2219.58s -> 2243.41s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[2243.41s -> 2246.67s]  Oh my god.
[2246.67s -> 2251.74s]  Okay.
[2251.74s -> 2255.61s]  This one's probably good too, now.
[2255.61s -> 2256.61s]  Yeah, 25 damage.
[2256.61s -> 2260.74s]  All enemies within your vision range take 25 damage every two seconds.
[2260.74s -> 2261.54s]  Or take the shield.
[2263.64s -> 2282.61s]  That's probably a good idea.
[2282.61s -> 2283.11s]  All right.
[2283.11s -> 2284.01s]  It's getting kind of crazy here.
[2284.01s -> 2288.01s]  Bullet speed plus 30%.
[2288.01s -> 2289.11s]  I'm going to do the moving speed.
[2289.11s -> 2289.91s]  I feel like I need it.
[2289.91s -> 2309.27s]  So many experience gems everywhere.
[2309.27s -> 2331.15s]  Pick up range.
[2331.15s -> 2333.58s]  Bullet speed.
[2333.58s -> 2336.58s]  Increase reload rate and move speed by 25% while Holy Shield is active.
[2336.58s -> 2341.32s]  Um, yeah.
[2341.32s -> 2350.57s]  Wow.
[2350.57s -> 2352.05s]  All right, this is definitely the one.
[2352.05s -> 2364.80s]  Feels like I get killed by a boss or something.
[2364.80s -> 2368.46s]  On every fifth shot, launch a fireball that deals 40 damage.
[2368.46s -> 2372.90s]  Burn as well.
[2372.90s -> 2375.52s]  I think I'm going to do maybe speed.
[2375.52s -> 2376.22s]  All right, I'll do the fire.
[2376.22s -> 2377.22s]  Yeah, this one.
[2377.22s -> 2387.07s]  All right, that's a new enemy.
[2387.07s -> 2406.85s]  Shit.
[2406.95s -> 2413.21s]  Oh, but it's so bad.
[2413.21s -> 2422.77s]  I think it's this one.
[2422.77s -> 2425.85s]  Why is it happening twice?
[2425.85s -> 2426.75s]  Why is it happening twice?
[2426.75s -> 2429.73s]  That shouldn't be happening twice.
[2429.73s -> 2452.05s]  Am I just getting really lucky or something?
[2452.05s -> 2453.05s]  Oh, yes.
[2453.05s -> 2502.91s]  Let's go.
[2502.91s -> 2503.81s]  Walk speed.
[2503.81s -> 2506.92s]  Uh, ghost friend.
[2506.92s -> 2509.42s]  Pick up range.
[2509.42s -> 2509.62s]  Go.
[2509.62s -> 2521.36s]  All right, I'll do ghost friend.
[2521.36s -> 2521.56s]  All right.
[2521.56s -> 2527.30s]  Whatever that is, I got to be careful.
[2527.30s -> 2561.93s]  My ears are itching.
[2561.93s -> 2563.03s]  Ah, all right.
[2563.03s -> 2564.36s]  What is it?
[2564.36s -> 2566.66s]  Triple the effect of the next upgrade you take.
[2566.66s -> 2567.46s]  Oh my God.
[2567.46s -> 2567.76s]  All right.
[2567.76s -> 2573.08s]  What is it?
[2573.08s -> 2575.96s]  I mean, wait.
[2575.96s -> 2581.05s]  That'll, I'll die.
[2581.05s -> 2586.82s]  Minus three that I'll, it'll kill me.
[2586.82s -> 2588.82s]  300% walk speed though.
[2588.82s -> 2605.98s]  That would be crazy.
[2605.98s -> 2608.75s]  That's your speed while shooting.
[2608.75s -> 2610.35s]  I mean, that's still amazing.
[2610.35s -> 2614.68s]  I could reroll it.
[2614.68s -> 2623.84s]  Should I try to reroll it?
[2623.84s -> 2626.98s]  So this will shoot three bullets behind me.
[2626.98s -> 2630.09s]  Wait.
[2630.09s -> 2630.79s]  So hold on a minute.
[2630.79s -> 2640.26s]  This will shoot three bullets behind me every time I click.
[2640.26s -> 2642.64s]  It sucks.
[2642.64s -> 2649.79s]  I'm doing it.
[2649.79s -> 2650.99s]  How come it's not shooting three?
[2650.99s -> 2659.02s]  Didn't say it triples the effect.
[2659.02s -> 2662.07s]  Oh, I got scammed.
[2662.07s -> 2664.66s]  Oh, well, I got seven minutes.
[2664.66s -> 2665.16s]  I'm fine.
[2665.16s -> 2670.23s]  It's three stacked together.
[2670.23s -> 2671.55s]  Is it?
[2671.55s -> 2672.65s]  I think it actually might be.
[2672.65s -> 2673.25s]  Yeah, no, it is.
[2673.25s -> 2673.85s]  It is.
[2673.85s -> 2674.45s]  It definitely is.
[2674.95s -> 2676.26s]  See what it's doing.
[2676.26s -> 2677.46s]  Yeah, it is three.
[2677.46s -> 2678.46s]  No, we didn't get scammed.
[2678.46s -> 2682.53s]  We're good.
[2682.53s -> 2713.39s]  Yeah, it's definitely three.
[2713.39s -> 2717.65s]  Maybe it's time for lightning.
[2717.65s -> 2757.23s]  I'm shooting a lot of bullets.
[2757.23s -> 2761.30s]  Okay, so but is that really that good?
[2761.30s -> 2771.01s]  So max HP, it'll take away one of the empty ones.
[2771.01s -> 2773.50s]  So that's just a free plus 10 more damage.
[2773.50s -> 2783.32s]  Okay, I'm doing it.
[2783.32s -> 2786.36s]  I can already tell the difference.
[2786.36s -> 2812.81s]  Worth it.
[2812.81s -> 2813.21s]  Five minutes.
[2813.21s -> 2829.44s]  We're almost there.
[2829.44s -> 2831.99s]  Is that zero?
[2831.99s -> 2834.29s]  Reload rate, bullet damage crazy, but max ammo.
[2834.29s -> 2842.55s]  Wouldn't that make my max ammo zero?
[2842.55s -> 2846.12s]  I would have one ammo.
[2846.22s -> 2848.65s]  No, no way.
[2848.65s -> 2853.50s]  You will spin so much though.
[2853.50s -> 2855.18s]  I go for it.
[2855.18s -> 2855.38s]  All right.
[2855.38s -> 2867.79s]  I'm going to go for it.
[2867.79s -> 2867.99s]  All right.
[2867.99s -> 2872.63s]  Turns out it was worth it.
[2872.63s -> 2877.25s]  Oh shit.
[2877.25s -> 2899.36s]  I just got hit by what?
[2899.36s -> 2907.32s]  Actually not great for right now because I can't aim.
[2907.32s -> 2934.20s]  I would love to aim at these guys.
[2934.20s -> 2949.24s]  Shit.
[2949.24s -> 2950.34s]  I was so close.
[2950.34s -> 2954.14s]  I think that kind of screwed me because I couldn't aim at.
[2954.14s -> 2956.94s]  I couldn't aim at the individual people shooting the eyeball.
[2956.94s -> 2958.80s]  The bullets.
[2958.80s -> 2959.20s]  Damn it.
[2959.20s -> 2961.33s]  It's all right.
[2961.33s -> 2964.41s]  Wait, is this stuff shotgun?
[2964.41s -> 2965.51s]  Oh, this is awesome.
[2965.51s -> 2966.01s]  Really?
[2966.01s -> 2974.14s]  There's so much to do.
[2974.14s -> 2984.55s]  I'm going to turn this down.
[2984.55s -> 2985.25s]  Okay.
[2985.25s -> 2993.26s]  Um, who should I unlock?
[2993.26s -> 2996.16s]  On every third shot throw out a wave of fire that burns enemies.
[2996.16s -> 2998.10s]  That's kind of cool.
[2998.10s -> 3002.81s]  Starts with more HP.
[3002.81s -> 3012.41s]  Right click to summon a shadow clone.
[3012.41s -> 3017.98s]  Starts with lightning.
[3017.98s -> 3021.31s]  That's pretty good.
[3021.31s -> 3024.91s]  Right click to quickly shoot all of your remaining ammo in random directions.
[3024.91s -> 3027.92s]  That's kind of cool too.
[3027.92s -> 3031.01s]  Is there more?
[3031.01s -> 3034.65s]  There's more.
[3034.65s -> 3034.85s]  All right.
[3034.85s -> 3037.68s]  I'm going to.
[3037.68s -> 3037.98s]  All right.
[3037.98s -> 3039.78s]  We're going to we're going to save our money for a second here.
[3039.78s -> 3041.08s]  Let's do the one.
[3041.08s -> 3041.68s]  All right.
[3041.68s -> 3042.48s]  More HP.
[3042.48s -> 3044.78s]  Let's do this one.
[3044.78s -> 3047.60s]  And shotgun.
[3047.60s -> 3050.50s]  I love shotguns.
[3050.50s -> 3052.00s]  I like that crossbow.
[3052.00s -> 3058.08s]  That's kind of cool.
[3058.08s -> 3061.84s]  Ooh, I like that too.
[3061.84s -> 3062.14s]  All right.
[3062.14s -> 3065.85s]  I'm going to go with shotgun.
[3065.85s -> 3070.67s]  Wait a minute.
[3070.67s -> 3077.23s]  Oh sword or shield.
[3077.23s -> 3078.83s]  Do I have to go in order?
[3078.83s -> 3079.23s]  Oh, okay.
[3079.23s -> 3082.45s]  Rank one.
[3082.45s -> 3093.33s]  I think I'm going to go with this pickup range is huge.
[3093.33s -> 3098.87s]  That's 3 6 9 12.
[3098.87s -> 3099.07s]  All right.
[3099.07s -> 3100.57s]  That's 15% pickup range.
[3100.57s -> 3108.85s]  I think I'm cool with that bullet damage and summon damage.
[3108.85s -> 3113.43s]  I mean just do more damage, right?
[3113.43s -> 3117.57s]  I think this this is the one to do.
[3117.57s -> 3117.87s]  Yeah.
[3117.87s -> 3118.17s]  Okay.
[3118.17s -> 3120.70s]  All right.
[3120.70s -> 3121.20s]  Let's go for it.
[3121.20s -> 3122.30s]  I got the shotgun.
[3122.30s -> 3127.42s]  I got a diamond.
[3127.42s -> 3127.72s]  All right.
[3127.72s -> 3132.02s]  This is the one.
[3132.02s -> 3133.22s]  You didn't have to stop aiming.
[3133.22s -> 3135.10s]  Well, the problem is I only had one shot.
[3135.10s -> 3136.85s]  And if I...
[3136.85s -> 3152.33s]  What do bullets do I have?
[3152.33s -> 3154.17s]  Okay.
[3154.17s -> 3158.20s]  A fire rate bullet damage.
[3158.20s -> 3160.00s]  I'm going to do damage and knock back with the shotgun.
[3160.00s -> 3164.64s]  That seems like a good idea.
[3164.64s -> 3175.72s]  Face is itchy.
[3175.72s -> 3186.92s]  Stop.
[3186.92s -> 3188.59s]  I kind of want this.
[3188.59s -> 3194.76s]  Enemies in your vision take 25 damage every two seconds.
[3194.76s -> 3199.11s]  Now the vision is what circle?
[3199.11s -> 3201.89s]  Oh, it's the little circle.
[3201.89s -> 3202.29s]  Okay.
[3202.29s -> 3204.58s]  I'm not happy about that, but whatever.
[3204.58s -> 3207.47s]  That's okay.
[3207.47s -> 3225.04s]  I thought it was the big circle.
[3225.04s -> 3226.04s]  I mean, it's a shotgun.
[3226.04s -> 3245.90s]  So might as well.
[3246.00s -> 3252.42s]  Actually, the vision thing is actually doing pretty good.
[3252.42s -> 3253.02s]  This is a little bit more.
[3253.02s -> 3269.87s]  It's more damage than the shotgun is doing.
[3269.87s -> 3285.58s]  Rapid fire shotgun.
[3285.58s -> 3285.78s]  All right.
[3285.78s -> 3287.76s]  What should I get for food today?
[3287.76s -> 3289.38s]  What do you guys think?
[3289.38s -> 3291.08s]  Somebody said Taco Bell.
[3291.08s -> 3296.56s]  They were going to get it, but I kind of screwed that up for them.
[3296.56s -> 3298.55s]  Oh, yeah.
[3298.55s -> 3301.67s]  Double shotgun blast.
[3301.67s -> 3303.76s]  Is it actually firing double?
[3303.76s -> 3308.13s]  I can't tell.
[3308.13s -> 3315.94s]  Is it?
[3315.94s -> 3319.82s]  It's just plus one.
[3319.82s -> 3321.82s]  Oh, it's the fifth projectile.
[3321.82s -> 3340.40s]  Okay.
[3340.40s -> 3344.61s]  Movement speed.
[3344.61s -> 3359.58s]  Good to get it early.
[3359.58s -> 3360.68s]  Vision range plus 15.
[3360.68s -> 3366.21s]  The damage from glare also applies the on-hit effects on your bullets.
[3366.21s -> 3367.11s]  Oh, okay.
[3367.11s -> 3371.59s]  So I have to get burn or freeze or something, right?
[3371.59s -> 3374.56s]  Oh, come on, dude.
[3374.56s -> 3374.96s]  Stop.
[3374.96s -> 3377.22s]  What am I doing?
[3377.22s -> 3398.36s]  I'm blowing it.
[3398.36s -> 3399.94s]  What do you got?
[3399.94s -> 3405.03s]  Raise bullet damage and bullet size by 15% permanently every time you heal.
[3405.03s -> 3407.81s]  Whoa.
[3407.81s -> 3425.87s]  I'm about to get hit.
[3425.87s -> 3429.26s]  So I have to start healing.
[3429.26s -> 3430.26s]  How do you heal though?
[3430.26s -> 3431.36s]  Reliably.
[3431.36s -> 3433.16s]  All I see is max HP.
[3433.16s -> 3435.98s]  I haven't seen heal HP yet.
[3435.98s -> 3437.38s]  Is it my doing something wrong?
[3437.38s -> 3443.00s]  Not healing somehow.
[3443.00s -> 3449.69s]  Fire path heals.
[3449.69s -> 3450.89s]  Fire and HP.
[3450.89s -> 3451.69s]  HP plus.
[3451.69s -> 3457.33s]  Okay.
[3457.33s -> 3459.68s]  Twice as much glare.
[3459.68s -> 3465.42s]  I'll do freeze because I need it.
[3465.42s -> 3490.83s]  Because glare will inflict freeze, right?
[3490.83s -> 3520.74s]  Very helpful.
[3520.74s -> 3525.62s]  This one?
[3525.62s -> 3527.82s]  You can get a healing fruit if you kill a tree.
[3527.82s -> 3530.73s]  Oh.
[3530.73s -> 3555.67s]  Good to know.
[3555.67s -> 3564.44s]  Does the eye have to be open for it to take damage?
[3564.44s -> 3572.56s]  Jeez.
[3572.56s -> 3576.36s]  Only talks to us when he needs us.
[3576.36s -> 3577.86s]  Well, I'm focusing.
[3577.86s -> 3583.60s]  I have to pay attention.
[3583.60s -> 3588.68s]  Probably going to do this.
[3588.68s -> 3623.71s]  Or should I do ghost?
[3623.71s -> 3624.41s]  Stop.
[3624.41s -> 3626.11s]  The freeze made me run into you.
[3626.11s -> 3634.15s]  Shit.
[3634.15s -> 3634.75s]  All right.
[3634.75s -> 3645.25s]  I'm losing it here.
[3645.25s -> 3650.04s]  Okay, there we go.
[3650.04s -> 3655.18s]  I mean, that's probably the one to do.
[3655.18s -> 3663.29s]  Yeah.
[3663.29s -> 3665.33s]  Reload rate.
[3665.33s -> 3667.37s]  Max ammo is big.
[3667.37s -> 3670.54s]  I can shoot three times, right?
[3670.54s -> 3681.05s]  Yep.
[3681.05s -> 3681.85s]  Oh my god.
[3681.85s -> 3682.95s]  I'm absolutely blowing it.
[3682.95s -> 3686.14s]  I'm moving so fast.
[3686.14s -> 3687.44s]  The movement speed made me run it.
[3687.44s -> 3689.54s]  I don't know if I want the movement speed.
[3689.54s -> 3693.10s]  It's too fast.
[3693.10s -> 3694.30s]  I wasn't prepared for it.
[3694.30s -> 3700.72s]  I just ran into that person twice.
[3700.72s -> 3701.02s]  All right.
[3701.02s -> 3734.54s]  I'll pull it together.
[3734.54s -> 3761.54s]  Die.
[3761.54s -> 3762.64s]  Have to take a healing thing?
[3762.64s -> 3763.24s]  I know.
[3763.24s -> 3775.72s]  It's this one.
[3775.72s -> 3777.22s]  I got to kill one of these trees.
[3777.22s -> 3794.64s]  I thought he was dead.
[3794.64s -> 3820.46s]  That was almost death.
[3820.46s -> 3825.53s]  This one?
[3825.63s -> 3830.29s]  I think so.
[3830.29s -> 3831.49s]  Trees have so much health.
[3831.49s -> 3836.41s]  Should I not even be trying?
[3836.41s -> 3837.41s]  I'm definitely in trouble though.
[3837.41s -> 3874.82s]  I'm not doing enough damage.
[3874.82s -> 3875.02s]  All right.
[3875.02s -> 3887.40s]  Give me a level.
[3887.40s -> 3888.20s]  All right.
[3888.20s -> 3897.01s]  Health?
[3897.01s -> 3897.51s]  Shield?
[3897.51s -> 3898.01s]  Probably.
[3898.01s -> 3898.51s]  I mean, it's got to be.
[3898.51s -> 3905.68s]  It has to be the shield because if I take a hit or curse,
[3905.68s -> 3906.28s]  that's just crit.
[3906.28s -> 3909.46s]  I'll do it.
[3909.46s -> 3937.94s]  I'm in so much trouble though.
[3937.94s -> 3941.45s]  Oh, glare and curse work together really well.
[3941.45s -> 3941.75s]  All right.
[3941.75s -> 3956.33s]  I see what you mean.
[3956.33s -> 3959.43s]  I have to take it.
[3959.43s -> 3960.13s]  I have to.
[3960.13s -> 3996.92s]  Because don't I get a bonus for that?
[3996.92s -> 4000.22s]  Just try to level up glare the whole way.
[4000.22s -> 4013.09s]  It's the only thing that's keeping me alive.
[4013.09s -> 4017.33s]  I think I'm going to get overwhelmed when it's all these sucker
[4017.33s -> 4017.83s]  things.
[4017.83s -> 4047.03s]  That's back.
[4047.03s -> 4071.00s]  I don't like any of these.
[4071.00s -> 4074.18s]  I don't like any of these but splinter is probably the best one.
[4074.18s -> 4094.08s]  Oh, I'm in trouble.
[4094.08s -> 4114.53s]  Oh, shit.
[4114.53s -> 4115.03s]  This thing.
[4115.03s -> 4167.98s]  I need a level.
[4167.98s -> 4185.03s]  Come on.
[4185.03s -> 4197.70s]  Shoot.
[4197.70s -> 4229.11s]  Dead.
[4229.11s -> 4230.11s]  There's nothing I could do.
[4230.11s -> 4231.60s]  I was so screwed.
[4231.60s -> 4232.90s]  I just couldn't kill anything.
[4232.90s -> 4234.04s]  Shit.
[4234.04s -> 4234.64s]  All right.
[4234.64s -> 4235.74s]  I'm going to do that one.
[4235.74s -> 4236.24s]  One more.
[4236.24s -> 4238.45s]  One more.
[4238.45s -> 4238.95s]  One more.
[4238.95s -> 4239.45s]  One more.
[4239.45s -> 4239.95s]  One more.
[4239.95s -> 4240.45s]  One more.
[4240.45s -> 4240.95s]  One more.
[4240.95s -> 4242.65s]  One more.
[4242.65s -> 4244.27s]  One more.
[4244.27s -> 4244.87s]  Character is good.
[4244.87s -> 4247.46s]  I'm going to try this.
[4247.46s -> 4250.77s]  I'm going to try the crossbow.
[4250.77s -> 4257.41s]  All the damage.
[4257.91s -> 4262.11s]  That counts as a crossbow, right?
[4262.11s -> 4262.31s]  All right.
[4262.31s -> 4265.56s]  Let's go again.
[4265.56s -> 4266.36s]  I feel like I'm going to like this.
[4266.36s -> 4266.76s]  You hold it.
[4266.76s -> 4273.98s]  You charge it.
[4273.98s -> 4279.59s]  This thing does a lot of damage.
[4279.59s -> 4284.46s]  Here's to everybody too.
[4284.46s -> 4287.50s]  I like it a lot actually.
[4287.50s -> 4290.84s]  We just need a ton of damage.
[4290.84s -> 4292.44s]  Why do his eyes look like that?
[4292.44s -> 4296.39s]  Like what?
[4296.39s -> 4296.59s]  Okay.
[4296.59s -> 4298.39s]  So technically it's one shot.
[4298.39s -> 4304.84s]  So this would be awesome, right?
[4304.84s -> 4307.59s]  Smite everybody after shooting your last shot.
[4307.59s -> 4309.39s]  I have one shot.
[4309.39s -> 4327.90s]  So yes, exactly precisely what I thought.
[4327.90s -> 4335.18s]  This is this is my weapon.
[4335.18s -> 4335.88s]  Okay.
[4335.88s -> 4337.08s]  That's cool.
[4337.08s -> 4343.98s]  I think I'm going with magnetism early.
[4343.98s -> 4351.68s]  Make sure I don't have to worry about it later.
[4351.68s -> 4354.65s]  You can hold it for a long time.
[4354.65s -> 4355.15s]  Wow.
[4355.15s -> 4355.75s]  All right.
[4355.75s -> 4362.43s]  I didn't know that.
[4362.43s -> 4370.12s]  You can probably chew through in a whole line of enemies like that.
[4370.12s -> 4372.47s]  All right.
[4372.47s -> 4375.17s]  Yes.
[4375.17s -> 4376.63s]  Double shot.
[4376.63s -> 4377.23s]  Oh fuck.
[4377.23s -> 4380.08s]  Yeah, that's disgusting.
[4380.08s -> 4398.68s]  That is disgusting.
[4398.68s -> 4404.21s]  Okay, a shot behind me too.
[4404.21s -> 4423.14s]  I think so.
[4423.14s -> 4424.44s]  Who said this sucks?
[4424.44s -> 4436.86s]  I don't know if I agree with you.
[4436.86s -> 4440.18s]  Dark Arts.
[4440.18s -> 4446.12s]  That could be good.
[4446.12s -> 4447.02s]  Whoa.
[4447.02s -> 4448.43s]  Yep.
[4448.43s -> 4456.50s]  This is one shot.
[4456.50s -> 4457.90s]  Although it's only doing two damage though.
[4457.90s -> 4470.72s]  That's kind of bad.
[4470.72s -> 4472.82s]  It doesn't scale with the charge.
[4472.82s -> 4490.71s]  Unfortunately, 100% that.
[4490.71s -> 4493.40s]  Yeah.
[4493.40s -> 4515.94s]  Reload rate is absolutely key here.
[4515.94s -> 4517.83s]  Ghost friend.
[4517.83s -> 4518.53s]  More reload.
[4518.53s -> 4519.23s]  Max ammo.
[4519.23s -> 4520.03s]  Wait a minute.
[4520.03s -> 4522.47s]  That's probably not a good idea.
[4522.47s -> 4526.43s]  Or is it a good idea?
[4526.43s -> 4527.43s]  Don't tell him.
[4527.43s -> 4538.81s]  Don't tell me what.
[4538.81s -> 4542.77s]  Take the lens.
[4542.77s -> 4546.36s]  Give all bullets to pass through 30% damage in size.
[4546.36s -> 4548.76s]  Oh, that's right.
[4548.76s -> 4550.63s]  Oh, I see.
[4550.63s -> 4574.47s]  One of these things.
[4574.47s -> 4584.58s]  I didn't know he's right next to me.
[4584.58s -> 4584.78s]  All right.
[4584.78s -> 4586.48s]  What is this one going to be?
[4586.48s -> 4589.38s]  Bullet damage and bullet size by permanently every time you heal.
[4589.38s -> 4590.93s]  All right.
[4590.93s -> 4595.97s]  I got to pick up that other thing then.
[4595.97s -> 4596.37s]  Where's that?
[4596.37s -> 4601.99s]  Where is it?
[4601.99s -> 4613.66s]  Two bounce.
[4613.66s -> 4614.46s]  Do the fire.
[4614.46s -> 4617.74s]  Pyro Mage.
[4617.74s -> 4618.34s]  Not bounce.
[4618.34s -> 4630.61s]  Pyro.
[4630.61s -> 4635.18s]  Or at least I can kill shit this time.
[4635.18s -> 4654.55s]  I was having a lot of trouble killing anything last time.
[4654.55s -> 4658.62s]  Bullets that pass through your magic lens will inflict burn.
[4658.62s -> 4659.12s]  Pick up range.
[4659.12s -> 4660.91s]  Vision range.
[4660.91s -> 4689.86s]  I mean, that's probably a good one to take.
[4689.86s -> 4696.07s]  Kill a tree.
[4696.07s -> 4697.17s]  Tree, tree, tree, tree.
[4697.17s -> 4697.77s]  What do you mean tree?
[4697.77s -> 4700.78s]  What happened?
[4700.78s -> 4714.51s]  Get the freeze so you can kill a tree.
[4725.32s -> 4729.87s]  That's three arrows.
[4729.87s -> 4730.67s]  Less damage.
[4730.67s -> 4738.92s]  But that seems kind of amazing.
[4738.92s -> 4755.22s]  It is.
[4755.22s -> 4763.89s]  It's plus four projectiles.
[4763.89s -> 4769.01s]  Get out of the way.
[4769.01s -> 4772.74s]  Dude.
[4772.74s -> 4774.34s]  Get out of the fucking way.
[4774.34s -> 4811.60s]  Why am I so slow?
[4811.60s -> 4814.68s]  This one's big.
[4814.68s -> 4815.38s]  This is big.
[4815.38s -> 4817.21s]  I got to be very careful.
[4817.21s -> 4820.15s]  Please be careful.
[4820.15s -> 4821.55s]  This is massive.
[4821.55s -> 4863.42s]  That's a massive deal.
[4863.42s -> 4867.02s]  Yes.
[4867.02s -> 4916.71s]  I need the heals.
[4916.71s -> 4917.61s]  Sorry.
[4917.61s -> 4920.20s]  I'm quiet Andy right now.
[4920.20s -> 4930.18s]  But I got to get to the end.
[4930.18s -> 4940.12s]  As much damage as your bullets.
[4940.12s -> 4950.26s]  Probably this, right?
[4950.26s -> 4954.76s]  Reload rate.
[4954.76s -> 4956.36s]  That's fire, right?
[4956.36s -> 4957.95s]  Do the dagger.
[4957.95s -> 4963.82s]  All right, we'll do the magic dagger.
[4963.82s -> 4965.52s]  I have to remember that that's my projectile.
[4965.52s -> 4985.78s]  I will confuse it.
[4985.78s -> 4990.64s]  I went around the tree.
[4990.64s -> 4999.36s]  I'm pissed.
[4999.36s -> 5043.06s]  I think it's this one.
[5043.06s -> 5047.98s]  Oh, that's huge.
[5047.98s -> 5052.15s]  That's monstrous.
[5052.15s -> 5087.27s]  That is monstrous.
[5087.27s -> 5090.89s]  Monstrous.
[5090.89s -> 5094.79s]  I just take the health.
[5094.79s -> 5096.09s]  So there's just 20.
[5096.09s -> 5097.43s]  Just take the extra health.
[5097.43s -> 5121.80s]  I'm taking it.
[5121.80s -> 5126.78s]  So I'm going to magic scythe.
[5126.78s -> 5130.20s]  Bullet speed.
[5130.20s -> 5131.56s]  Shield.
[5131.56s -> 5159.54s]  Yeah.
[5159.54s -> 5162.56s]  Bullet damage and fire rate when you get hit.
[5162.56s -> 5165.64s]  That one's pretty good.
[5165.64s -> 5166.64s]  I think this one's good.
[5166.64s -> 5167.34s]  10 extra damage.
[5167.34s -> 5168.14s]  30 extra damage.
[5168.14s -> 5205.05s]  Yep.
[5205.05s -> 5208.91s]  Let's go.
[5208.91s -> 5210.71s]  Oh my God.
[5210.71s -> 5212.61s]  Reload rate and speed.
[5212.61s -> 5222.27s]  Reload rate.
[5222.27s -> 5235.99s]  Am I at the cap?
[5235.99s -> 5237.19s]  Holy shit.
[5237.19s -> 5238.69s]  Bullet damage and knockback.
[5238.69s -> 5258.18s]  Yep.
[5258.18s -> 5260.65s]  How come I haven't healed yet?
[5260.65s -> 5269.51s]  Don't I have something that heals every time somebody dies by something?
[5269.51s -> 5271.21s]  Curse 2 would be insane.
[5271.21s -> 5271.91s]  Summon damage.
[5271.91s -> 5284.68s]  That's it's definitely curse.
[5284.68s -> 5285.58s]  How come you don't blink?
[5285.58s -> 5286.45s]  I haven't.
[5286.45s -> 5289.18s]  I like I have.
[5289.18s -> 5291.64s]  I'm doing curse.
[5291.64s -> 5292.04s]  Holy shit.
[5292.04s -> 5295.12s]  I probably I don't think I have blinked.
[5295.12s -> 5295.62s]  Oh my God.
[5295.62s -> 5297.37s]  You're right.
[5297.37s -> 5297.77s]  Hold on.
[5297.77s -> 5303.16s]  Give me a second.
[5303.16s -> 5311.40s]  Jesus.
[5311.40s -> 5389.07s]  I just like made my I just made it worse.
[5389.07s -> 5394.95s]  We got fire rate and reload rate by 10% permanently every time you get hit.
[5394.95s -> 5396.15s]  Okay, that's okay.
[5396.15s -> 5433.10s]  I guess this is such a great build.
[5433.10s -> 5435.64s]  I can't lose it now.
[5435.64s -> 5448.88s]  You got to play smart.
[5448.88s -> 5454.94s]  Oh, I don't like that.
[5454.94s -> 5463.82s]  That's I mean doubled though better shield.
[5463.82s -> 5465.62s]  I think that's the that's the safe play.
[5465.62s -> 5574.60s]  Not the cool play, but it's a safe one.
[5574.60s -> 5680.09s]  Burn.
[5680.09s -> 5681.13s]  See you later.
[5681.13s -> 5685.20s]  What do we got?
[5685.20s -> 5687.92s]  Speed.
[5687.92s -> 5688.72s]  Fire rate.
[5688.72s -> 5691.69s]  Spread.
[5691.69s -> 5692.99s]  Max ammo.
[5692.99s -> 5694.96s]  Summon damage.
[5694.96s -> 5699.18s]  It's just speed.
[5699.18s -> 5725.91s]  Be careful speed damage.
[5725.91s -> 5761.16s]  So yeah, hell yeah.
[5761.16s -> 5761.76s]  I just want to kill it.
[5761.76s -> 5772.21s]  I need to know what it is.
[5772.21s -> 5772.71s]  My God.
[5772.71s -> 5776.56s]  This thing's still alive.
[5776.56s -> 5789.35s]  Yes, when diamonds HP is at or below half of Max HP piercing plus to a knockback.
[5789.35s -> 5813.70s]  Oh, well, look at all these goodies over here.
[5813.70s -> 5815.40s]  Zero point five percent chance.
[5815.40s -> 5835.37s]  Okay, two minutes.
[5835.37s -> 5853.76s]  I feel like it's going to get crazy here in a second.
[5853.76s -> 5858.56s]  When Holy Shield is not active kills with smite lower the regeneration time for Holy
[5858.56s -> 5859.76s]  Shield by one second.
[5859.76s -> 5860.16s]  Damn.
[5860.16s -> 5860.46s]  All right.
[5860.46s -> 5882.08s]  That's amazing.
[5882.08s -> 5884.69s]  Try to get to level 30, right?
[5884.69s -> 5921.58s]  Probably important.
[5921.58s -> 5922.08s]  Oh, yeah.
[5922.08s -> 5925.79s]  This is this over 40 seconds.
[5925.79s -> 5945.28s]  Nice 30 seconds.
[5945.28s -> 5967.38s]  Not level 30, but it's all right.
[5967.38s -> 5973.43s]  Yeah, great.
[5973.43s -> 5974.93s]  10,000 currency.
[5974.93s -> 5977.50s]  Nice.
[5977.50s -> 5984.64s]  Very cool.
[5984.64s -> 5984.94s]  All right.
[5984.94s -> 5985.74s]  Let's do one more.
[5985.74s -> 5987.34s]  Just joke one, right?
[5987.34s -> 5988.34s]  Let's do one more crazy one.
[5988.34s -> 5990.67s]  What do I want to unlock?
[5990.67s -> 5995.62s]  Maybe the flamethrower.
[5995.62s -> 6022.45s]  Okay, I'm going to do flamethrower and the flame character darkness one small survive
[6022.45s -> 6027.70s]  the night to unlock greater challenges small enemy spawn more often.
[6027.70s -> 6031.58s]  I'll just do regular fun to watch.
[6031.58s -> 6035.81s]  It's kind of like Binding of Isaac.
[6035.81s -> 6036.31s]  Oh my goodness.
[6036.31s -> 6041.80s]  That's fast.
[6041.80s -> 6044.20s]  Well, this is a great character.
[6044.20s -> 6045.10s]  It's a joke character.
[6045.10s -> 6049.58s]  But I mean when I'm in joke character, I meant joke weapons.
[6049.58s -> 6054.43s]  This is not a joke character.
[6054.43s -> 6056.53s]  Go darkness one to progress.
[6056.53s -> 6060.01s]  That's all right.
[6060.01s -> 6061.11s]  I restart.
[6061.11s -> 6073.19s]  I wasn't looking at the best kind of the whole game.
[6073.19s -> 6076.76s]  Oh, you're betting.
[6076.76s -> 6081.71s]  Sorry.
[6081.71s -> 6082.81s]  Well, we refund it.
[6082.81s -> 6090.06s]  Refund it.
[6090.06s -> 6090.96s]  You ruin the bets.
[6090.96s -> 6091.36s]  It's all right.
[6091.36s -> 6093.02s]  I just we can refund.
[6093.02s -> 6098.70s]  It'll work.
[6098.70s -> 6102.56s]  The SMG is OP too.
[6102.56s -> 6106.27s]  Oh wait, I can do another rune.
[6106.27s -> 6106.97s]  All right here.
[6106.97s -> 6108.37s]  Now you're betting on this one.
[6108.37s -> 6112.87s]  Okay, same deal.
[6112.87s -> 6115.17s]  And I will do darkness one.
[6115.17s -> 6130.94s]  You turned off the rune.
[6130.94s -> 6131.94s]  Wait, don't bet yet.
[6131.94s -> 6132.74s]  Wait, hold on.
[6132.74s -> 6134.14s]  Did I turn off a rune?
[6134.14s -> 6134.94s]  Oh shit.
[6134.94s -> 6137.60s]  Hold on.
[6137.60s -> 6138.90s]  I unequipped the rune.
[6138.90s -> 6139.80s]  Oh, okay.
[6139.80s -> 6144.82s]  Well, we're going to restart.
[6144.82s -> 6146.62s]  You can only pick one for tree.
[6146.62s -> 6151.99s]  Oh, okay.
[6151.99s -> 6156.74s]  I didn't know that.
[6156.74s -> 6157.34s]  I get it.
[6157.34s -> 6157.74s]  All right.
[6157.74s -> 6162.18s]  So this is 10% damage and summon damage.
[6162.18s -> 6167.08s]  Okay, 10% damage.
[6167.08s -> 6169.48s]  10% damage.
[6169.48s -> 6169.88s]  All right.
[6169.88s -> 6176.42s]  Now you're for real betting on this right now.
[6176.42s -> 6178.02s]  I mean you guys it doesn't really matter.
[6178.02s -> 6180.10s]  You're going to bet anyways.
[6180.10s -> 6181.20s]  Do you think I'm going to win or not?
[6181.20s -> 6186.39s]  Like it's not like we have to redo it all.
[6186.39s -> 6189.06s]  It's not we don't have to redo it.
[6189.06s -> 6192.78s]  You guys are going to bet anyways.
[6192.78s -> 6201.47s]  Yeah, it's equipped.
[6201.47s -> 6201.97s]  Okay.
[6201.97s -> 6202.37s]  Here we go.
[6202.37s -> 6203.47s]  Darkness one.
[6203.47s -> 6204.57s]  Rune is equipped.
[6204.57s -> 6205.07s]  20 minutes.
[6205.07s -> 6213.89s]  Let's go for it.
[6213.89s -> 6217.70s]  This weapon's fun.
[6217.70s -> 6218.20s]  Oops.
[6218.20s -> 6219.30s]  Oh, I was too busy.
[6219.30s -> 6220.00s]  It's all right.
[6220.00s -> 6240.92s]  They haven't even bet yet.
[6240.92s -> 6241.42s]  All right.
[6241.42s -> 6245.95s]  I'm thinking fire rate, spread, and reload rate.
[6245.95s -> 6247.35s]  Fire rate right here.
[6247.35s -> 6251.46s]  Bingo.
[6251.46s -> 6252.76s]  Oh my god.
[6252.76s -> 6253.36s]  Oh my god.
[6253.36s -> 6256.90s]  I'm so sorry everybody that's going to lose.
[6256.90s -> 6275.27s]  I'm not used to being this slow.
[6275.27s -> 6283.45s]  Everything's fine.
[6283.45s -> 6285.16s]  I think it's just fun.
[6285.16s -> 6286.82s]  But burn.
[6286.82s -> 6293.22s]  It's the burn character.
[6293.22s -> 6298.10s]  Fire rate.
[6298.10s -> 6299.00s]  I need reload rate.
[6299.00s -> 6324.97s]  Bad.
[6324.97s -> 6325.67s]  Reload rate.
[6325.67s -> 6327.03s]  There it is.
[6327.03s -> 6329.73s]  Oh, double.
[6329.73s -> 6330.63s]  I need the reload rate.
[6330.63s -> 6352.72s]  Bad.
[6352.72s -> 6353.52s]  Don't worry believers.
[6353.52s -> 6399.33s]  I got your back.
[6399.33s -> 6430.21s]  Oh, ah.
[6430.21s -> 6431.01s]  Don't worry believers.
[6431.01s -> 6462.42s]  I'm not giving in.
[6462.42s -> 6535.02s]  I'm not giving in.
[6535.02s -> 6536.06s]  Drastic.
[6536.06s -> 6565.85s]  It was drastic, but it should work out.
[6565.85s -> 6566.55s]  All right, what do we got?
[6566.55s -> 6567.15s]  I got three health.
[6567.15s -> 6569.98s]  I'm good.
[6569.98s -> 6572.38s]  Burn damage plus 67%.
[6572.38s -> 6574.94s]  Oh my goodness.
[6574.94s -> 6577.26s]  Hey, believers.
[6577.26s -> 6578.06s]  I got you back.
[6578.06s -> 6587.51s]  I almost walked into somebody, I think.
[6587.51s -> 6589.76s]  Why did I narrate that part?
[6589.76s -> 6590.56s]  Like, I got you back.
[6590.56s -> 6592.13s]  I almost just walked into somebody.
[6592.13s -> 6593.03s]  Like, yeah, no shit.
[6593.03s -> 6593.93s]  You fucking idiot.
[6593.93s -> 6594.93s]  Who are you talking about?
[6594.93s -> 6595.63s]  Of course you.
[6595.63s -> 6621.83s]  Oh.
[6621.83s -> 6622.73s]  I'm sorry believers.
[6622.73s -> 6624.80s]  I couldn't help it.
[6624.80s -> 6625.70s]  I was just too slow.
[6625.70s -> 6627.20s]  This thing's so fast.
[6627.20s -> 6627.80s]  I'll win it back.
[6627.80s -> 6628.20s]  I'll get it back.
[6628.20s -> 6629.80s]  Just bet on me right now.
[6629.80s -> 6630.40s]  Bet on me right now.
[6630.40s -> 6632.19s]  I'll get it back right now.
[6632.19s -> 6632.89s]  Bet on me right now.
[6632.89s -> 6633.69s]  Bet on me right now.
[6633.69s -> 6634.19s]  Bet on me right now.
[6634.19s -> 6634.49s]  You lost.
[6634.49s -> 6635.89s]  I know, but bet on me right now.
[6635.89s -> 6636.59s]  Bet on me right now.
[6636.59s -> 6637.49s]  Bet right now.
[6637.49s -> 6638.29s]  Bet on me right now.
[6638.29s -> 6640.13s]  I'm telling you right now to bet on me.
[6640.13s -> 6642.43s]  I am saying bet on me right fucking now.
[6642.43s -> 6644.53s]  I'm going to go all 20 minutes.
[6644.53s -> 6645.03s]  Bet on me.
[6645.03s -> 6647.09s]  I'm telling you do it.
[6647.09s -> 6648.29s]  Do it.
[6648.29s -> 6678.07s]  Check this out.
[6678.07s -> 6697.70s]  I'm telling you bet on me right now.
[6697.70s -> 6700.42s]  I'm not fucking around.
[6700.42s -> 6705.62s]  Not anymore.
[6705.62s -> 6708.14s]  Double shot.
[6708.14s -> 6715.27s]  It just got real right now.
[6715.27s -> 6718.21s]  Imagine being a non-believer right now
[6718.21s -> 6800.65s]  after seeing what I just picked up.
[6800.65s -> 6801.05s]  You're believing?
[6801.05s -> 6801.25s]  Good.
[6801.25s -> 6802.76s]  You should.
[6802.76s -> 6805.44s]  I'm not going to be communicating that much with you.
[6805.44s -> 6809.31s]  I'm trying to win you channel points.
[6809.31s -> 6824.43s]  Mitigation is going to cease as of right now.
[6824.43s -> 6825.63s]  That's burn effect.
[6825.63s -> 6828.50s]  Glare puts on burn effect.
[6828.50s -> 6834.26s]  Can you imagine spending money against me after what you...
[6834.26s -> 6852.97s]  Really?
[6852.97s -> 6854.87s]  I mean, if you bet against me at this point,
[6854.87s -> 6856.47s]  I mean, you got like a...
[6856.47s -> 6878.91s]  Your hands are kind of full of fucking air.
[6878.91s -> 6931.42s]  A lot of crunchies over here.
[6931.42s -> 6933.12s]  Dude, if I win this, I deserve.
[6933.12s -> 6938.98s]  I deserve McDonald's tonight if I win.
[6938.98s -> 6941.65s]  I'm just being really, really honest.
[6941.75s -> 6967.94s]  I deserve five Happy Meals.
[6967.94s -> 6968.74s]  Welcome to McDonald's.
[6968.74s -> 6970.14s]  How can I help you?
[6970.14s -> 6973.52s]  Yeah, I'd like to get five Happy Meals, please.
[6973.52s -> 6976.07s]  I don't have any kids.
[6976.07s -> 6980.06s]  Should I say that?
[6980.06s -> 6990.44s]  Oh, yeah.
[6990.44s -> 6993.54s]  I don't have any kids there for me.
[6993.54s -> 7004.28s]  Okay, I don't care, but all around.
[7004.28s -> 7009.40s]  It's illegal to buy a Happy Meal if you don't have any kids.
[7009.40s -> 7010.30s]  Shut up.
[7010.30s -> 7180.32s]  Not you.
[7180.32s -> 7192.50s]  If you lose, you have to get one of the gyros from Arby's.
[7192.50s -> 7200.44s]  World's grossest fast food item.
[7200.44s -> 7205.40s]  That's not part of the deal.
[7205.40s -> 7209.08s]  That could be the world's grossest fast food item.
[7209.08s -> 7211.26s]  A gyro, gyro.
[7211.26s -> 7212.36s]  There's a, I don't know.
[7212.36s -> 7217.93s]  You know what I mean?
[7217.93s -> 7220.45s]  That's my favorite comment of the whole night.
[7220.45s -> 7221.55s]  Okay, if I...
[7221.55s -> 7222.95s]  No, that's gross.
[7222.95s -> 7228.39s]  I don't want to do that.
[7228.39s -> 7231.62s]  Gyro, gyro, gyro.
[7231.62s -> 7232.92s]  It's gyro.
[7232.92s -> 7233.52s]  Stop.
[7233.52s -> 7234.22s]  What do I pick?
[7234.22s -> 7234.72s]  Do I just leave?
[7234.72s -> 7241.24s]  I don't think any of these work.
[7241.24s -> 7245.84s]  Power, but bullets is not, it's not gonna help.
[7245.84s -> 7247.44s]  Can the fire bounce?
[7247.44s -> 7259.50s]  I feel like that sucks.
[7259.50s -> 7260.40s]  I think I'm just gonna leave.
[7260.40s -> 7261.80s]  I don't like any of these.
[7261.80s -> 7267.67s]  Not for what I have right now.
[7267.67s -> 7275.40s]  Bullet bounce plus two, but can the fire even bounce off anything?
[7275.40s -> 7278.40s]  This would be the one that I'd pick, but I don't really know if I want this.
[7278.40s -> 7281.82s]  Bullets, I mean, maybe this is all right.
[7281.82s -> 7286.50s]  Bouncy fire.
[7286.50s -> 7288.41s]  I'm just leaving.
[7288.41s -> 7289.01s]  Oh, wait.
[7289.01s -> 7289.61s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[7289.61s -> 7290.31s]  That doesn't count.
[7290.31s -> 7291.11s]  That actually doesn't count.
[7291.11s -> 7293.55s]  I pressed D instead of S.
[7293.55s -> 7295.55s]  That, I would have to do it again because I pressed,
[7295.55s -> 7298.90s]  I thought I was pressing S, but I was pressing D instead.
[7298.90s -> 7301.00s]  I took too long on that dumbass screen.
[7301.00s -> 7302.30s]  So I pressed D.
[7302.30s -> 7304.29s]  I was trying to hold S.
[7304.29s -> 7305.19s]  Whatever, just bet on me again.
[7305.19s -> 7305.89s]  I promise.
[7305.89s -> 7306.19s]  All right.
[7306.19s -> 7307.75s]  This is the real one.
[7307.75s -> 7309.09s]  This is the real one.
[7309.09s -> 7312.29s]  If I lose, I have to get a fucking gyro from Arby's.
[7312.29s -> 7315.05s]  And if I win, then I get my McDonald's Happy Meals.
[7315.05s -> 7315.55s]  This is the real one.
[7315.55s -> 7323.06s]  This is my bet.
[7323.06s -> 7323.66s]  This one's for real.
[7323.66s -> 7348.90s]  This one's for me.
[7348.90s -> 7350.50s]  You have to eat it live on stream.
[7350.50s -> 7355.02s]  No, I will take a picture of it.
[7355.02s -> 7363.23s]  I will take a picture of at least two bites out of it.
[7363.23s -> 7365.06s]  You know what's crazy?
[7365.06s -> 7367.26s]  I don't want to eat fucking Arby's.
[7367.26s -> 7369.26s]  I don't want that at all.
[7369.26s -> 7370.76s]  I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[7370.76s -> 7372.40s]  I'm gonna be silent now.
[7372.40s -> 7375.14s]  I don't want to eat an Arby's gyro.
[7375.14s -> 7375.94s]  I don't want that.
[7375.94s -> 7378.34s]  That sounds awful to me right now.
[7378.34s -> 7379.74s]  That's the last thing I want.
[7379.74s -> 7382.21s]  I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[7382.21s -> 7384.21s]  I'm actually putting both headphones in for this.
[7384.21s -> 7384.81s]  And I'm shutting up.
[7384.81s -> 7468.52s]  I'm not going to talk the rest of the time I'm playing.
[7468.52s -> 7470.02s]  Pyro does not sound like a good idea, though.
[7470.02s -> 7472.57s]  Because why would I get pyro?
[7472.57s -> 7474.47s]  My bullets already inflict burn.
[7474.47s -> 7480.23s]  Why would I do pyro?
[7480.23s -> 7480.93s]  It stacks?
[7480.93s -> 7643.33s]  Okay, I didn't know that.
[7643.33s -> 7777.05s]  That's not good.
[7777.05s -> 7778.29s]  It's dead?
[7778.29s -> 7786.04s]  Oh shit, I killed it.
[7786.04s -> 7834.64s]  Yes.
[7834.64s -> 7841.86s]  Oh my goodness.
[7841.86s -> 7845.22s]  Sick super fast rate.
[7845.22s -> 7847.52s]  Triple base max ammo.
[7847.52s -> 7868.62s]  I get to have McDonald's today.
[7868.62s -> 7879.82s]  All right, let's go.
[7879.82s -> 7884.22s]  I need burn damage, burn damage, burn damage, burn damage.
[7884.22s -> 7885.22s]  I see burn damage up.
[7885.22s -> 7885.82s]  I need it.
[7885.82s -> 7934.69s]  Shit.
[7934.69s -> 7936.27s]  I don't know.
[7936.27s -> 7968.27s]  It's probably Galeria.
[7968.27s -> 7969.17s]  I need lightning too.
[7969.17s -> 7970.17s]  The lightning is going to be...
[7970.17s -> 7976.72s]  The lightning is doing so much work here, more than the fire.
[7976.72s -> 7983.80s]  I need lightning damage increase.
[7983.80s -> 7985.75s]  That's pretty good.
[7985.75s -> 7994.72s]  That's pretty good too.
[7994.72s -> 8011.70s]  I'll go with ice.
[8011.70s -> 8032.22s]  They're closing in.
[8032.22s -> 8050.98s]  I'm surrounded.
[8050.98s -> 8069.36s]  Shoot someone!
[8069.36s -> 8071.27s]  Dark arts.
[8071.27s -> 8075.20s]  Dark arts.
[8075.20s -> 8081.09s]  Arby's, we have the meat.
[8081.09s -> 8098.90s]  Frostbite.
[8098.90s -> 8101.56s]  Jesus, it's that.
[8101.56s -> 8102.46s]  Or it's curse.
[8102.46s -> 8131.10s]  It's curse.
[8131.10s -> 8146.52s]  Oh, it's that one.
[8146.52s -> 8147.82s]  Why are there so many things?
[8147.82s -> 8159.21s]  Oh, it's because I did that hard mode.
[8159.21s -> 8159.91s]  It's that.
[8159.91s -> 8165.18s]  Or I need more reload.
[8165.18s -> 8166.18s]  Bad.
[8166.18s -> 8186.41s]  That's a dire.
[8186.41s -> 8189.43s]  When you inflict freeze, also inflict burn.
[8189.43s -> 8193.44s]  Whoa.
[8193.44s -> 8204.31s]  Let's go.
[8204.31s -> 8206.81s]  The new Arby's disgusting chicken sandwich.
[8206.81s -> 8207.61s]  I feel bad.
[8207.61s -> 8209.57s]  Okay, I feel kind of bad.
[8209.57s -> 8213.20s]  Because like I think Arby's is a fucking awful place.
[8213.20s -> 8214.50s]  But I mean, is it all right?
[8214.50s -> 8218.55s]  I don't know.
[8218.55s -> 8229.62s]  Does that like mean what I'm saying?
[8229.62s -> 8231.29s]  Oh shit.
[8231.29s -> 8232.09s]  Oh no.
[8232.09s -> 8274.91s]  I don't want to go to Arby's.
[8274.91s -> 8275.71s]  Why am I reloading?
[8275.71s -> 8280.07s]  I have auto reload on.
[8280.07s -> 8321.87s]  Every 10 enemies killed by curse will increase your bullet damage by 1% permanently.
[8321.87s -> 8340.28s]  This one.
[8340.28s -> 8340.98s]  Shit, I bumped somebody.
[8340.98s -> 8374.41s]  I didn't even see them.
[8374.41s -> 8411.94s]  I'm okay.
[8411.94s -> 8413.04s]  Where's the boss?
[8413.04s -> 8414.83s]  Where's the boss die?
[8414.83s -> 8465.38s]  Where's the boss?
[8468.60s -> 8486.06s]  It's probably this.
[8486.06s -> 8487.16s]  Watch out for the tree.
[8504.71s -> 8506.55s]  Oh my God, that's so good.
[8506.55s -> 8542.60s]  Come on.
[8542.60s -> 8543.90s]  Oh, yeah.
[8543.90s -> 8544.40s]  Yeah.
[8544.40s -> 8545.20s]  Oh, yeah.
[8545.20s -> 8588.56s]  I think so.
[8588.56s -> 8589.92s]  Glare?
[8589.92s -> 8596.64s]  I think it's glare.
[8596.64s -> 8597.34s]  Glare.
[8597.34s -> 8636.87s]  Let's go.
[8636.87s -> 8756.65s]  Oh, holy shit.
[8756.65s -> 8759.15s]  10% fire rate every time she inflicts burn.
[8759.15s -> 8767.25s]  Oh, knock back.
[8767.25s -> 8767.85s]  Knock back.
[8767.85s -> 8768.55s]  Knock back.
[8768.55s -> 8769.15s]  Knock back.
[8769.15s -> 8769.65s]  Knock back.
[8769.65s -> 8784.51s]  Knock back.
[8787.85s -> 8798.99s]  I don't have to eat at Arby's.
[8798.99s -> 8799.79s]  Well, hold on.
[8799.79s -> 8801.09s]  Don't get cocky.
[8801.09s -> 8810.03s]  I could die really quickly here.
[8810.03s -> 8812.53s]  Fire rate, bullet damage, reload rate, ammo, piercing.
[8812.53s -> 8817.12s]  Yep.
[8817.12s -> 8817.82s]  That's over.
[8817.82s -> 8818.82s]  It's literally over.
[8818.82s -> 8828.84s]  It's over.
[8828.84s -> 8852.81s]  I killed the tree.
[8852.81s -> 8855.72s]  This is just absolutely stupid what's going on right now.
[8855.72s -> 8858.91s]  Look at how fast this is.
[8858.91s -> 8860.83s]  Look at this fire rate.
[8860.83s -> 8895.18s]  The game is broken.
[8895.18s -> 8911.49s]  This whole bet is so stupid.
[8911.49s -> 8912.29s]  Might hit level 40.
[8912.29s -> 8929.07s]  I might.
[8929.07s -> 8932.42s]  38.
[8932.42s -> 8933.82s]  Wait, I'll do this.
[8933.82s -> 8954.46s]  Stand still.
[8954.46s -> 8968.53s]  Firework.
[8968.53s -> 8989.02s]  Holy shit, don't be stupid.
[8989.02s -> 9002.75s]  I don't think I'm not going to hit 40, but still cool.
[9002.75s -> 9008.56s]  I did it.
[9008.56s -> 9010.76s]  Sorry, Arby's fans.
[9010.76s -> 9018.59s]  Not tonight.
[9018.59s -> 9022.00s]  Eating an Arby's gyro.
[9022.00s -> 9023.40s]  That's such a huge punishment.
[9023.40s -> 9027.09s]  I like, wouldn't you feel bad if you were Arby's?
[9027.09s -> 9034.03s]  No, I don't want to lose a bet and eat an Arby's gyro.
[9034.03s -> 9034.83s]  Double or nothing?
[9034.83s -> 9038.43s]  What, I have to eat two Arby's gyros or no?
[9038.43s -> 9039.33s]  There's no double or nothing.
[9039.33s -> 9039.83s]  That's it.
[9039.83s -> 9043.31s]  Your eyes are deep fried.
[9043.31s -> 9051.20s]  They are?
[9051.20s -> 9056.98s]  I think they're okay.
[9056.98s -> 9057.48s]  Maybe not.
[9057.48s -> 9061.32s]  Maybe they're a little weird.
[9061.32s -> 9063.00s]  It was worth it.
[9063.00s -> 9065.79s]  And that's where I'm going to end the stream.
[9065.79s -> 9067.09s]  I think that's a solid place to go out on.
[9067.09s -> 9068.92s]  I will buy some stuff though.
[9068.92s -> 9070.92s]  This game is absolutely fantastic.
[9070.92s -> 9074.64s]  What a great game this is.
[9074.64s -> 9075.74s]  This is really good.
[9075.74s -> 9078.29s]  Very good.
[9078.29s -> 9080.09s]  I got to say, this is wonderful.
[9080.09s -> 9084.50s]  This is a great game.
[9084.50s -> 9084.90s]  Dual S.
[9084.90s -> 9108.07s]  All right, I just want to test these.
[9108.07s -> 9114.97s]  I like this.
[9114.97s -> 9119.07s]  Start the game with your HP at half of your max HP.
[9119.07s -> 9125.38s]  Bullet damage and fire rate by 5% per rank.
[9125.38s -> 9129.78s]  I kind of feel kind of bad.
[9129.78s -> 9134.31s]  I'm going to unlock all the weapons.
[9134.31s -> 9140.14s]  Bat gun, grenade launcher, magic bow.
[9140.14s -> 9149.39s]  All right, I just want to try the SMGs.
[9149.39s -> 9149.99s]  That's kind of cool.
[9149.99s -> 9151.49s]  All right, I'm going to try spark.
[9151.49s -> 9152.83s]  With the dual SMGs.
[9152.83s -> 9153.73s]  I just want to try.
[9153.73s -> 9156.80s]  I'm just going to try.
[9156.80s -> 9163.38s]  I'm going to play for 10 seconds.
[9163.38s -> 9168.74s]  Yeah, it's pretty damn good.
[9168.74s -> 9169.44s]  This is great.
[9169.44s -> 9169.94s]  OK, cool.
[9169.94s -> 9172.26s]  What a great game.
[9172.26s -> 9172.96s]  Synergies.
[9172.96s -> 9178.13s]  Oh, that was helpful.
[9178.13s -> 9179.71s]  All right, I'll see you guys later.
[9179.71s -> 9180.71s]  I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[9180.71s -> 9183.01s]  Wednesday, we're going to play Sorcery Part 3.
[9183.01s -> 9188.10s]  Going back to it should be a nice, chill stream.
[9188.10s -> 9189.10s]  Thanks for watching today.
[9189.10s -> 9190.63s]  The games were fun.
[9190.63s -> 9193.60s]  Had a good time, as always.
[9193.60s -> 9195.00s]  And I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[9195.00s -> 9198.00s]  And then again, I'll be on Name Your Price on Austin Show's
[9198.00s -> 9205.21s]  Name Your Price this Thursday.
[9205.21s -> 9213.05s]  I think I earned a Happy Meal.
[9213.25s -> 9213.75s]  Thanks for watching.
[9213.75s -> 9218.32s]  Thanks for the support.
[9218.32s -> 9224.68s]  Take care of yourselves.
[9224.68s -> 9230.94s]  Hopefully we see you soon.
[9230.94s -> 9235.76s]  This has to be five Happy Meals.
[9235.76s -> 9239.16s]  If I had lost that round, I would have been like,
[9239.16s -> 9239.96s]  all right, see you guys later.
[9239.96s -> 9242.36s]  Yeah, I'll tweet out the Arby's.
[9242.36s -> 9243.16s]  I would have turned the stream off.
[9243.16s -> 9246.50s]  I would have went and talked to Holly.
[9246.50s -> 9249.52s]  I would have closed the door and been like,
[9249.52s -> 9256.58s]  how do we fake me eating Arby's because I really don't want it?
[9256.58s -> 9257.38s]  But I would have to prove it.
[9257.38s -> 9265.98s]  I would have to have to take a bite on camera and prove it to you, right?
[9265.98s -> 9272.86s]  Oh, God.
[9272.86s -> 9275.19s]  Somebody got a McDonald's ad.
[9275.19s -> 9281.16s]  Really?
[9281.16s -> 9286.85s]  Well, you're making it sound so much worse than it is.
[9286.85s -> 9289.91s]  I know it's not that bad,
[9289.91s -> 9297.37s]  but I actually genuinely don't like Arby's at all.
[9297.37s -> 9305.71s]  It is probably one of my least favorite fast food places.
[9305.71s -> 9306.41s]  Have you ever eaten it?
[9306.41s -> 9310.21s]  Yes, I've had it twice and both times I said,
[9310.21s -> 9322.43s]  I do not really like this.
[9322.43s -> 9331.53s]  You're making it sound like you're forced to eat prison slop.
[9331.53s -> 9336.52s]  The new Arby's prison slop sandwich full of meat,
[9336.52s -> 9340.04s]  cheese, and onions.
[9340.04s -> 9349.22s]  Authentic to the real thing.
[9349.22s -> 9350.12s]  All right, I'll see you guys later.
[9350.12s -> 9351.50s]  See you guys Wednesday.
[9351.50s -> 9355.89s]  Starting at, let's see, what time should I start on Wednesday?
[9355.89s -> 9357.29s]  We're probably going to start early on Wednesday.
[9357.29s -> 9364.16s]  Probably like somewhere between 12 and 1.
[9364.16s -> 9367.26s]  We'll probably start somewhere around 12 31 on Wednesday.
[9367.26s -> 9372.79s]  Pacific.
[9372.79s -> 9373.19s]  Good night, though.
[9373.19s -> 9374.95s]  We'll see you soon.
[9374.95s -> 9377.70s]  Take it easy.
[9377.70s -> 9425.42s]  Goodbye.
[9425.42s -> 9425.72s]  Yeah.
