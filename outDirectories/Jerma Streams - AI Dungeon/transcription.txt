[0.44s -> 16.36s]  Hello! Hi! What up? How's everybody doing? Give back the lipstick. Oh, well, it's right here.
[17.90s -> 26.79s]  It'll be returned in a timely prompt manner when I'm finished with it. That makes it sound like I'm
[26.79s -> 38.94s]  wearing it now, but I'm not. But welcome back, huh? Another day. Today, we're gonna do something called
[39.82s -> 47.82s]  A.I. Dungeon 2. I currently am. There was a lot of debate on how to get this to actually run.
[48.94s -> 53.34s]  It was, oh, just use the website. Oh, don't use the website. Maybe do this, run it locally. I found
[54.54s -> 64.14s]  the best way. Live from Las Vegas, Nevada. It's the Jerma Show. No, there wasn't. Yes, there was.
[65.10s -> 73.10s]  There was like, there was like two people that were in a huge fight. They were saying, guys,
[73.10s -> 77.10s]  just let him run the beta client. And then like somebody popped in and was like, dude,
[77.66s -> 82.94s]  he needs to run the collab client. And I don't, I don't, I'm not sure if those people are still here,
[82.94s -> 94.58s]  but they were screaming. That was me. No, I gotta run him. It's ready to go. I actually have a game
[94.58s -> 103.40s]  going right now. I have been told a few things about this. This apparently is not the most stable
[103.40s -> 111.56s]  program on earth because it's a very, it's in beta. It's running through a client. It's running
[111.56s -> 118.50s]  through another client. So this is, there's, this is probably going to crash a few times,
[118.50s -> 124.31s]  but I should be able to come right back. Oh, I got like something, what's on my throat today?
[128.81s -> 131.69s]  I've messed with it for a while. It crashes a lot. Yeah. So expect it to be
[132.97s -> 138.33s]  not perfect, but we're going to get what we can out of it. If you don't know what A.I. Dungeon is,
[138.89s -> 144.65s]  uh, it is essentially Talk to Transformer, but what I've been told much more elaborate
[145.37s -> 151.13s]  and focused than that. You roll a dungeon and you have to play through the dungeon.
[151.93s -> 161.54s]  It being not that stable is an understatement. It's incredibly unstable. What's going on? Like
[161.54s -> 170.70s]  what happened here? Did I drink eggs? What's wrong with my voice? I feel like I swallowed
[170.70s -> 182.12s]  two or three raw eggs. Hold on. Whatever. It's going to be fine. I'm going to be doing like
[182.12s -> 188.17s]  voices anyways. So, uh, let's do the first one. Let's get started. It's already ready to go.
[189.37s -> 195.66s]  Here it is. So we get, I didn't do a random story. I figured we would do,
[196.62s -> 207.69s]  start off easy, right? Here comes the porn. Uh, would mean porn. Uh, I'm going to give this,
[207.69s -> 212.01s]  hold on just a second. This is a porn game. It's not a porn game.
[216.38s -> 220.46s]  Anyways, we're going to do fantasy because that's the one that's recommended is fantasy, mystery,
[220.46s -> 229.72s]  apocalyptic zombies, or a custom story. It's not porn game. It's, I'm going to avoid all the pornographic
[229.72s -> 235.24s]  scenarios. Okay. Let's do fantasy. We're going to start with fantasy. That's the easy one.
[236.06s -> 244.92s]  Pick a character in fantasy, a noble, a knight, a wizard, a peasant, or a rogue. I'm going to be a
[244.92s -> 253.99s]  noble. I want to be a noble. I think that would be, that is a good start. Noble. What is your name?
[255.45s -> 280.36s]  What is my name? Well, they call me many things in this town. Sire, Lord, Larry, Lord Larry,
[280.36s -> 301.26s]  Lord, Lord Leonard, Lord. I'm a noble. I'm Larry. Lord, Lord, Lord Lance. No, Lord
[303.08s -> 312.79s]  Leo, Lord Leo. Oh, uh, what is your, oh, these are instructions. Okay. All right. Right. Right.
[312.79s -> 320.90s]  Right. So now I got these things. What I'm going to do now is I'm okay. I'm going to zoom in a
[320.90s -> 341.21s]  little bit here so we can do this together. Cause I don't want, I don't want to be any spoilers.
[341.93s -> 352.57s]  Okay. Here we go. You are Lord Leo, a noble from the land of Brothian. You have a pendant
[352.57s -> 360.28s]  and a house seal. One morning you are awakened by one of your laborers. She tells you that your
[360.28s -> 365.30s]  state is being surrounded. You look out the window and see a group of men dressed in black,
[365.30s -> 369.54s]  standing on top of the hill. They are armed with crossbows and wearing leather armor.
[370.10s -> 374.02s]  The woman who woke you also says they are very well dressed.
[377.58s -> 392.34s]  Well, this music doesn't make any sense now. All right, here we go. This really this quickly.
[393.06s -> 415.70s]  What do you do? Uh, okay. I closed the blinds. The man who wakes you looks at you and then turns
[415.70s -> 421.06s]  his attention to the window. He closes it, but not before you can see him turn around and say,
[421.14s -> 425.94s]  I'm sorry about this. He walks over to you and puts his hand on your shoulder.
[432.66s -> 440.90s]  I'm sorry about this. We must protect this house.
[449.30s -> 457.22s]  Lord Leo, I will protect my home. He says, yes, yes, I know you, you reply, but we need to get
[457.46s -> 461.70s]  inside. He nods and begins walking towards the door.
[465.67s -> 480.65s]  No, not your house, my house. He begins walking towards the door. I reply,
[481.94s -> 502.79s]  no, I mean my house must be protected, right? Like, well, what's that's what gods do, you know?
[505.96s -> 517.03s]  All right, hold on. Look outside. Are they still there? You watch as the man continues to walk
[517.03s -> 522.71s]  towards the door. Suddenly, he stops and turns around. He points to the house and speaks in an
[522.71s -> 527.99s]  odd language. It sounds like some sort of ancient tongue, but you don't understand a word. The man
[527.99s -> 541.74s]  starts walking back towards the house. Wait, is he signaling to people? All right, that sounds like
[541.74s -> 556.18s]  some sort of ancient tongue. Close and lock the door before he gets in. He's part of the resistance.
[557.26s -> 561.90s]  You close the door and lock it with a key. Then you stand up and start pacing around the room.
[562.46s -> 578.22s]  Finally, you sit down on the bed and begin thinking. Call mom. She'll know what to do.
[580.95s -> 587.43s]  You call out to your mother, but she doesn't answer. She must be busy. You think about calling
[587.43s -> 598.49s]  her again. When you're alone, you continue to wait for her to return. Okay, I gotta arm myself
[601.40s -> 612.71s]  a sword. You grab a sword off the table and put it into its scabbard. You also grab a dagger from
[612.71s -> 617.35s]  the draw and put it into its scabbard. You take a small leather pouch from your pocket and put some
[617.35s -> 631.40s]  coins in it. You open the door and enter the room. Leave the house. You exit the house and
[631.40s -> 636.44s]  head back to the inn. When you arrive, you find that the innkeeper has already left.
[636.44s -> 647.70s]  You wonder if you should follow him or go back to the house. Follow the innkeeper.
[654.66s -> 661.48s]  You follow the innkeeper back to the house. Wait, he's going back to my house? Eventually,
[661.48s -> 666.60s]  you reach it. You knock on the door, but no one answers. You try the front door, but there is
[666.60s -> 675.32s]  nobody there either. You decide to check the back door, but it is locked too. Did I lock myself out
[675.32s -> 690.46s]  of my house? I think I locked myself out of my house. Okay, break in the house. You rush through
[690.46s -> 695.02s]  the back door and run straight to the bedroom. You quickly grab a nearby knife and stab the wall
[695.02s -> 700.06s]  several times until you hear something fall on the floor. You peek through the peephole and see a
[700.62s -> 714.39s]  woman dressed in black standing behind you. What? How do you look through a peephole and see somebody
[714.39s -> 722.95s]  behind you? That doesn't make any sense. Oh, from dressed in black. It's the people that were coming
[722.95s -> 741.90s]  to get me. Turn around, ask the woman why she is here. She smiles and tells you,
[743.88s -> 764.54s]  my name is Lilith and I'm here to help you. How are you going to help me? She replies,
[764.62s -> 777.67s]  by helping me kill you. Oh, that's a pretty good, that's a pretty good one-liner.
[779.10s -> 795.21s]  By helping me kill you. Don't kill me. I can pay. See, like, whatever it is, I'll double.
[796.70s -> 803.93s]  Don't kill me. I can pay. She laughs and says, no, you won't, but you might still be able to save
[803.93s -> 827.14s]  your own life. I won't pay. Run out of the house. You run out of the house and down the stairs.
[827.14s -> 836.47s]  You don't stop running until you are far away from the area. This is Minecraft? Call mom.
[837.66s -> 842.22s]  You call out to your mother, but she does not answer. You think about calling for her again
[842.22s -> 854.38s]  later when you're alone. You continue to wait for her to return. Wait for mom to return. You wait
[854.38s -> 861.18s]  patiently for mom to come back. Eventually, she returns. She seems upset. You think about how she
[861.18s -> 869.40s]  would feel if you had killed her son. You hope she doesn't hate you for it. Is that about me?
[870.04s -> 891.11s]  She's talking about me. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Do I have a brother? Greet her with open
[891.11s -> 903.51s]  arms. You greet her warmly. Mom smiles and hugs you tightly. You tell her everything. Mom tells
[903.51s -> 909.59s]  you that she is glad you came back because she was worried about you. She asks you if you would want
[909.59s -> 925.78s]  to stay with her tonight. You say yes and she kisses you goodbye. Okay, dig down five blocks.
[932.26s -> 938.04s]  You dig down five blocks and find a house. Inside the house, you find a young girl. She looks very
[938.04s -> 942.52s]  frightened and confused. You tell her that you are her father and uncle and that you've been looking
[942.52s -> 961.70s]  for her all day. What? Keep digging down and keep digging down until you find, keep digging down
[961.70s -> 974.02s]  until you find obsidian. You keep digging down and eventually you find a large stone block.
[974.58s -> 979.38s]  You pick it up and place it on the ground. You then shout, this is where you were buried.
[979.94s -> 1000.38s]  The girl runs forward and grabs the stone. She stares at it in awe. Ask for the stone. You ask
[1000.38s -> 1005.19s]  the girl, where did you bury the other boy? She looks at you and says his body fell down into the
[1005.19s -> 1009.27s]  river and washed up here. His name is Harry and he drowned in the river last year.
[1009.67s -> 1034.07s]  Run full speed into cave wall. You sprint into the cave and jump onto the rock face. You throw
[1034.07s -> 1040.89s]  yourself at the cave wall and slam your fist against it. You scream in pain and cry out, oh god,
[1040.89s -> 1062.65s]  oh god, oh god, oh god. Go to the doctor. Go to the doctor. You run back to the house and tell mom
[1062.65s -> 1076.74s]  what happened. She takes you to the doctor who examines you. The doctor says we are going to
[1076.74s -> 1090.86s]  have to remove the hand and he pulls out a finger and then pulls out another finger and another.
[1091.42s -> 1112.44s]  Finally, he removes your entire hand. This is, that's fucked up. Uh, ask for him to do the
[1113.00s -> 1124.42s]  left hand. Ask for him to do the other hand. The doctor comes over and examines your hands. He
[1124.42s -> 1128.98s]  tells you that you will need two more fingers removed. He puts his hand on your right hand
[1128.98s -> 1141.43s]  and begins to pull out your fingers. You scream in agony and beg him to stop. Finally, he finishes
[1141.43s -> 1153.54s]  removing them. The doctor says I am going to have to remove all your toes too.
[1166.52s -> 1171.40s]  He removes your feet as well. You scream in horror and yell at him to stop.
[1171.40s -> 1198.89s]  Finally, he stops and looks at you. I'm sorry. I have the wrong chart. Uh oh, it's thinking.
[1200.20s -> 1225.77s]  It's thinking. It's thinking. It's really thinking. Uh oh. I'm sorry. I have another patient
[1225.77s -> 1250.54s]  chart. Am I dead? I'm sorry. Rewind. Revert's the last action. Okay, it's the last revert.
[1250.54s -> 1273.82s]  You have to reload the cell. Shit. Damn it. New story. I died. I'm dead. Uh, he removed my hands
[1273.82s -> 1279.82s]  and feet with no, um, no, no, no volcano anesthesia and I just died. And he told me,
[1279.82s -> 1285.50s]  I'm sorry. I have the wrong chart. That's it. That's where I'm dead. All right. I gotta reload
[1285.50s -> 1300.31s]  the cell. Fatal error. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1300.31s -> 1308.39s]  I think, okay, no, hold on. Yeah, it's fucked up. Oh, I can load the game. I can load this game.
[1308.39s -> 1323.19s]  Wait, wait, wait. I can use the same ID. Can I? No, let me try to load this. Yeah, it's the load.
[1323.19s -> 1330.92s]  It might crash it. Oh, so don't, don't, do not load games. Try not using dialogue in the game.
[1330.92s -> 1336.97s]  Type stuff like, you tell your mother to take you to the doctor. Should I not use quotes? Like,
[1336.97s -> 1342.41s]  should I? Don't put thing in quotes. Just say, like, the doctor says this. The doctor says you
[1342.41s -> 1354.38s]  have, so, so use quotes. Okay. All right. It's booting back up. Why didn't I read the instructions?
[1354.38s -> 1362.01s]  I, I did. Quotes are fine, but start with this person says, okay. I've read the instruction.
[1362.65s -> 1388.23s]  When you want other people to talk, do not use quotes. Okay. It's coming back. Don't use the
[1388.23s -> 1399.53s]  word ask. It breaks a lot of these. Okay. Do whatever. The AI will figure it out.
[1400.17s -> 1416.07s]  All right. It's coming. It's coming. It's loading. This may take a few minutes.
[1416.79s -> 1429.78s]  Well, we knew this was going to happen. Can you guys even see it? Ask it for now, but let's
[1429.78s -> 1437.10s]  start a new one. Let's start a new one. I guess the first time I did it. All right. It should
[1437.10s -> 1448.10s]  start in a second here. This is funny though. Make my own Nancy Drew story. All right. That
[1448.10s -> 1460.87s]  sounds good. I'm going to do mystery and I'm going to, I'm going to be Nancy Drew. Do a completely
[1460.87s -> 1482.17s]  random one. We will. I want to do a Drew crew first. I need some mystery music. One in the chat
[1482.17s -> 1498.60s]  for the Drew crew. Yeah. All right. Here we go. Mystery. I need like a good one. Okay. New game,
[1500.94s -> 1514.95s]  zero random story. No mystery. Let's do mystery. Pick a character detective. I want to be a
[1514.95s -> 1529.83s]  detective. What is your name? My name is Nancy Drew. Yeah. Interaction starting with a verb.
[1530.79s -> 1536.79s]  Go to the tavern or attack the orc to speak. Enter, say the thing you want to say or just
[1536.79s -> 1539.91s]  the thing you want to say, right? Yeah, that's correct. All right. Here we go.
[1542.09s -> 1549.46s]  No, it's going to be Nancy Drew soundtrack. Nancy Drew music. I mean, it has to be like a
[1549.46s -> 1557.26s]  relaxing and peaceful Nancy Drew music. You guys didn't think you were going to get it two
[1557.26s -> 1570.10s]  times in a row. I picked a spy. Oh shit. Whatever. You are Nancy Drew, a spy living in Chicago.
[1570.66s -> 1576.34s]  You have a concealed pistol and a syringe of poison. You listen to the Russian diplomats
[1576.34s -> 1582.02s]  and hear them discussing how they can get rid of you. If we could kill you with a car bomb,
[1582.02s -> 1594.06s]  one says, oh, we could blow up your hotel room. Where are we? Where are we?
[1595.66s -> 1615.48s]  Oh, that was a great Russian accent. I look around the room. You turn on the light switch
[1615.48s -> 1619.16s]  and see that there is no way anyone would be able to enter the room without being seen.
[1619.16s -> 1638.63s]  The door is locked from the inside. Okay. Call mom. You call your mom's cell phone number and
[1638.63s -> 1643.43s]  wait for her to pick up. When she does, you tell her what happened. She tells you to go back to
[1643.43s -> 1652.70s]  sleep. The next day you call again. This time you speak more clearly. Say, I am in trouble.
[1656.23s -> 1669.14s]  Right? That's what they want you to do. Like say, and then quotes, right? I am in trouble.
[1670.46s -> 1675.18s]  Mom, mom hangs up on you. You feel like crying. It isn't fair. Why can't you just understand?
[1675.90s -> 1690.79s]  Remove pistol and aim at what was, would they have names? Remove pistol? No, no, no.
[1690.87s -> 1698.47s]  Remove pistol from shirt. Remove pistol from shirt. Where is it hidden? Remove pistol from shirt.
[1705.21s -> 1708.33s]  You take off your shirt and put it over your head. Then you place the gun
[1708.33s -> 1717.72s]  under your pillow. A few hours later, you hear a knock at the door. You open it. A man with a
[1717.72s -> 1732.71s]  bushy mustache stands before you. He looks like he has been drinking. Say, please come in. Please
[1732.71s -> 1757.38s]  come in. He didn't say anything. You keep breaking it by doing quotes? I, doesn't it say up here?
[1761.54s -> 1774.22s]  Say the thing you want to say with quotes. Wait, he said, please come in. Tell him to come in.
[1778.81s -> 1810.62s]  Come in. So come in. If I, is it a mirror? I close the door or she, she closes the door, right?
[1811.58s -> 1838.84s]  Shoot. Mirror. I think it's fucked. It shattered beautifully. Just wait. Oh, I think it might be
[1838.84s -> 1851.45s]  dead again. The game tell, hold on. What? The game tells you quotes are okay, but they are not. They
[1851.45s -> 1863.78s]  make the AI much more prone to crashing. Just don't ever use quotes ever again. True. Correct. Yes.
[1869.45s -> 1874.95s]  So I'm just not going to use quotes anymore. I'm just going to just tell the game what
[1874.95s -> 1887.69s]  people already said. Okay. Should we wait this out? Don't use them. I just won't use them at all.
[1888.25s -> 1913.75s]  It's broken. Fuck. Use parentheses? Let's try it again. Redo it. No, don't use parentheses.
[1913.75s -> 1918.30s]  Don't use brackets. I'm just not going to use quotes anymore. If you use quotes and it really,
[1918.86s -> 1929.90s]  it's prone to just dumping out, then I don't even want to use them. Start with a verb every time.
[1929.90s -> 1943.42s]  Okay. Pick detective this time. Make a custom story. Well, I want to get one to work to completion
[1943.42s -> 1961.48s]  first. Instead of getting my hands and feet cut off and then the thing crashing. The AI says you
[1961.48s -> 1971.80s]  can use words, but it actually makes it more prone to crashing. Just use emojis. You can say things
[1971.80s -> 1979.14s]  like say, and then the, yeah, that's what I was doing. I was doing say space quotation something,
[1979.14s -> 1988.87s]  quotation, end. It screwed it up. Dermawalk, the crew wants more Drew. Not going to happen.
[1989.67s -> 2017.14s]  Not right now. All right. We're almost ready. Set the next story in Super Frogland. I'm out.
[2018.66s -> 2029.86s]  Drew crew. The original, I'm using the collab one. That's the one I'm using right now. That is the
[2029.86s -> 2050.42s]  current one I'm using. All right. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[2050.42s -> 2056.73s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
[2057.45s -> 2072.68s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
[2073.66s -> 2079.35s]  Let's go. Let's go. Yeah. All right. We're going to get it. Third time's the charm. No more quotes.
[2080.15s -> 2111.43s]  New game. Not a random story. Mystery. Detective. Drew. Let's go. Here it comes. The first one we
[2111.43s -> 2124.78s]  got at least far enough where I died. Here we go. You are Drew, the detective living in Chicago.
[2125.34s -> 2129.74s]  You have a pistol and a police badge. You enter the forest where you believe the criminal you're
[2129.74s -> 2143.02s]  searching for fled to. Suddenly, you hear a gunshot behind you. Look behind. Look behind you or look
[2143.02s -> 2155.26s]  behind me. Am I dead? Did I just get shot from behind? Look behind me. What is it? You turn
[2155.26s -> 2170.17s]  around and see that you've shot yourself in the head. What the fuck are you talking about?
[2170.97s -> 2203.59s]  Am I still alive? Am I dead? No, you're alive. The bullet was lodged in your brain,
[2203.59s -> 2222.14s]  but it didn't kill you yet. You can still move your body. Go to the hospital. You run back
[2222.87s -> 2229.27s]  and find out that you're not dead yet. A doctor comes and examines you. He says he's going to
[2229.27s -> 2248.34s]  have to operate on you right away. He says you might never walk again. The doctor removes
[2249.75s -> 2272.30s]  both feet. It's the same doctor. Is it going to break it? The doctor. Do the operation. Okay.
[2273.50s -> 2283.90s]  Do the operation. Nice detective story. Do the operation. This won't break it.

[2296.50s -> 2303.22s]  immediately. You feel so much better after the operation. Your body is stronger than ever before.
[2303.86s -> 2317.82s]  You even managed to get a job as a detective again. A year passes. Go to the forest. That's
[2317.82s -> 2330.30s]  where I was supposed to go. Go to the forest. I was trying to find a criminal. You decide to
[2330.30s -> 2334.54s]  go to the forest where you first met your mother. She told you about how she used to hide from the
[2334.54s -> 2339.82s]  monsters there. You wonder if you should try to find her again or just forget all about it.
[2348.65s -> 2360.87s]  Hide from the monsters. Is that going to break it? Call mom. Yeah, that's a good idea. Call mom.
[2366.15s -> 2372.15s]  You call your mother's number one more time. It rings, but no answer. You wait for a while,
[2372.15s -> 2376.15s]  then finally give up. You realize that you won't be able to talk to your mother anymore anyway.
[2376.23s -> 2387.74s]  You don't know what will become of you now. Track criminal. Track a criminal.
[2389.08s -> 2411.11s]  Track a criminal. Call dad. Track a criminal. You decide to search for the criminal who killed
[2411.11s -> 2416.39s]  your mother. You follow his trail and eventually catch him. He tells you that he knows who you
[2416.39s -> 2431.61s]  are because he saw you in the newspaper. That's why she wouldn't answer the phone. Torture? Oh,
[2431.69s -> 2454.01s]  electrocute. What the fuck? Electrocute the criminal. With how? The criminal doesn't
[2454.01s -> 2461.53s]  seem surprised by this suggestion. He electrocutes you instead. You scream in pain and fall unconscious.
[2461.53s -> 2492.73s]  You wake up in a strange room with a man holding a gun to your head. Does that work? Is that going
[2492.73s -> 2505.30s]  to break it? You say that he should shoot himself. Don't type you. Say, so say you say,
[2506.26s -> 2533.58s]  say he should shoot himself. Tell, say in quotes, shoot yourself. Tell him to shoot himself.

[2586.94s -> 2604.49s]  Leave, just how about leave area, leave room. Take, take his wallet. Take his wallet. You take

[2649.10s -> 2654.14s]  You hear a loud noise and the picture falls off the wall. You look down and see that you're wearing
[2654.14s -> 2679.03s]  a blue suit. You also notice that you're no longer bald. You're a blue. No, I'm a detective. Go.

[6436.31s -> 6439.27s]  you try to wipe the blood from your eyes and then you realize that you are still alive
[6439.83s -> 6443.43s]  you stumble back to the bank and collapse on the ground you gasp for air and cough up some blood

[6486.55s -> 6511.64s]  happened i fell off a cliff and broke my neck okay look at the bridge you look at the bridge
[6511.64s -> 6516.36s]  and notice that there is now a big gap between you and the other side that's weird who would
[6516.36s -> 6543.72s]  build a bridge like this maybe they just wanted to get rid of us take down the bridge you climb
[6543.72s -> 6549.00s]  down the ladder and start climbing down the bridge as you do so you hear a loud noise you turn around
[6549.00s -> 6553.80s]  and see a huge boulder falling towards you you quickly scramble away from the bridge what was
[6553.80s -> 6573.99s]  that this is like a hangover dream this whole thing is it just a dream it's just a weird
[6573.99s -> 6605.85s]  dream that you might have ask the boulder why it fell you look at the boulder and ask why did it
[6605.85s -> 6612.89s]  fall the boulder looks at you with its big stupid eyes and says because i'm dumb you laugh and say
[6612.89s -> 6641.03s]  well at least you're not dead ask the boulder to join you look at the boulder and ask would you
[6641.03s -> 6647.90s]  like to join me the boulder looks at you and smiles sure you both walk along the bridge together
[6648.46s -> 6666.30s]  so how come you didn't tell anyone about this place am i doing my doing this correctly the boulder
[6666.30s -> 6686.98s]  says no quotes the boulder says boulder says it is because of war no the boulder says is because
[6688.30s -> 6713.42s]  it is too expensive don't speak for other characters oh right the boulder shrugs and
[6713.42s -> 6718.86s]  says it was a secret project by an old rich guy who died nobody knows about it except me and you
[6719.58s -> 6735.77s]  you smile and nod how much does it cost to join you the boulder sighs and says a lot and the boulder
[6740.17s -> 6763.86s]  100 gold coins give the boulder 100 gold coins that's a lot right we lost the music
[6764.50s -> 6772.98s]  you give the boulder 100 gold coins and it grins it starts walking faster wow that was easy now
[6772.98s -> 6788.94s]  let's go find another way across the river follow the boulder into the forest look at the trees
[6792.09s -> 6800.73s]  literally dumber than a rock literally scammed by a rock it's all right it'll be fine you look
[6800.73s -> 6804.49s]  at the trees and notice that they all have the same strange pattern they seem to be trying to
[6804.49s -> 6824.26s]  tell you something what is this examine the pattern recruit the trees after you inspect the
[6824.26s -> 6829.38s]  patterns on the trees and notice that they are all different sizes the smallest one has five leaves
[6829.38s -> 6835.83s]  while the largest has 20 this is some sort of code what is it saying it's saying join us
[6836.95s -> 6857.90s]  join the trees you join the trees and they become your new home you then continue on your journey
[6858.84s -> 6863.85s]  i think we should keep going there must be more trees out here yeah but where are we going to
[6863.85s -> 6887.00s]  sleep tonight we'll figure it out go to the past go to the pasture sleep in boulder's arms
[6887.32s -> 6914.62s]  you lie down on the boulder's chest and close your eyes you feel safe there okay i think we've got
[6914.62s -> 6921.26s]  enough information for now let's get back to work you wake up and head back to work ask the boulder
[6927.96s -> 6947.53s]  ask to ride the boulder ask to ride the boulder so we can like roll roll the boulder at roll the

[6978.54s -> 6998.52s]  you begin to climb down the hill there's no point in stopping let's just go as fast as possible
[6999.08s -> 7003.16s]  you reach the bottom of the hill and stop where did we go we went through a tunnel
[7006.63s -> 7025.06s]  investigate the tunnel how did he avoid that getting lewd you walk forward and see a large
[7025.06s -> 7032.02s]  hole in the ground a small light shines inside the hole that looks like a cave where is it it's
[7032.02s -> 7040.25s]  behind us you both enter the cave and it leads to a room with a table and chairs look under the

[13482.12s -> 13485.32s]  out the door and head towards the nearest store which looks like it's been completely gutted and
[13485.32s -> 13489.96s]  ransacked with a large amount of blood splattered all over the floor of the walls as well as the
[13489.96s -> 13515.13s]  front window smashed in leaving you with only a broken glass pane it's in the you walk out of

[14229.24s -> 14234.95s]  a sorcerer king who's trying to conquer the world this is a bootleg version of the thing we did
[14234.95s -> 14260.44s]  before live stream the fellowship of the ring you turn on the live stream and you see that is
[14260.44s -> 14264.12s]  indeed still running the only thing you can tell is that it looks like it's going to be a long day
[14264.12s -> 14272.26s]  the sun is setting and you are tired you close your eyes and fall asleep while the stream is
[14273.46s -> 14280.84s]  sleeping on stream while streaming the lord of the rings i know i'm not supposed to do this
[14281.56s -> 14310.38s]  but can you imagine if you came to a stream i can't do it i can't i'll get in trouble
[14311.10s -> 14315.32s]  i was gonna play like a five minute lord of the rings clip when i slept in my chair
[14315.96s -> 14346.73s]  i probably i'm probably gonna get like suspended now wake up do a parody video wake up and yell at
[14346.73s -> 14350.89s]  twitch chat for not hitting his subtrain goal you wake up and you realize you forgot to hit
[14350.89s -> 14354.81s]  your sub train goal so you decide to get on twitch chat and yell at them for not hitting
[14354.81s -> 14376.36s]  their sub train goal they don't seem to mind though so you go back to sleep wake up screaming
[14386.38s -> 14405.91s]  wake up and pause the movie tell the twitch chat omega low you wake up but you've realized you've
[14405.91s -> 14409.75s]  got to pause the movie you decide to get on twitch chat and pause the movie they don't seem to mind
[14409.75s -> 14450.31s]  though, you go back to sleep. Get suspended from Twitch for streaming Lord of the Rings and sleeping.
[14451.35s -> 14460.30s]  Oh, I spelled Twitch wrong. After getting suspended from 12th grade for streaming Lord of the Rings,
[14460.30s -> 14471.29s]  you decide to go on Twitch chat. After getting suspended from 12th grade for streaming Lord of
[14471.29s -> 14475.53s]  the Rings, you decide to get on Twitch chat again. But this time you are going to do something
[14475.53s -> 14484.46s]  different. So you're going to stream Lord of the Rings with no commentary. Just enjoy yourself.
[14494.14s -> 14502.14s]  Get banned from Twitch for repeat offenses. For a repeat offense.
[14516.79s -> 14520.55s]  After getting banned from 12th grade, you decide to get on Twitch again. But this time you're
[14520.55s -> 14527.08s]  going to stream Lord of the Rings with no commentary. Just enjoy yourself. The next day
[14527.08s -> 14532.28s]  comes, but your stream is still running. So much for being suspended. I didn't even get banned.
[14537.82s -> 14548.01s]  Pop in the two towers while you stream naked.
[14551.02s -> 14570.94s]  Surely this has to get you banned. The next day comes, but your stream is still running. So much
[14570.94s -> 14574.70s]  for being suspended again. The next day comes, but your stream is still running. So much for being
[14574.70s -> 14580.44s]  suspended again. The next day comes, but your stream is still running. I think it's broken.
[14594.94s -> 14600.44s]  Yeah, it's broken. MonkaS. MonkaS. MonkaS. MonkaS. MonkaS. MonkaS.
[14601.40s -> 14608.74s]  All right. I'm going to check on the other one. I want to do a Twitch adventure on the big one.
[14608.74s -> 14613.19s]  The one that's more elaborate than this. You know what I'm saying? We got to do like a Twitch
[14613.19s -> 14619.26s]  adventure on this one. Or even like opening up YouTube videos on it. You know what I'm saying?
[14619.98s -> 14624.73s]  All right. This one, we'll do one more of these and we should be good to go.
[14629.77s -> 14645.29s]  Reset. You are now in the middle of the third week of your suspension and it seems...
[14647.75s -> 14652.12s]  What? You're now in the middle of the third week of your suspension and it seems that it
[14652.12s -> 14657.72s]  has finally caught up with you. Your account was given a 24 hour ban and then a permanent one was
[14657.72s -> 14679.02s]  given out after that period of time had passed. What kind of sick joke is that? Turn the stream
[14679.02s -> 14685.26s]  back on naked again. Make a new account and do it again. You're now in the middle of the third week
[14685.26s -> 14701.59s]  of your suspension and it seems that it's finally caught up with you. Make a new account. I got IP
[14701.59s -> 14732.58s]  banned. Ban evasion. You know... No, I can't. I'm banned. I'm IP banned. Come on. Let's go.
[14739.58s -> 14760.92s]  No, I'm done. It's out. It's dead. I have to like reload this. Custom. Here we go.
[14760.92s -> 14785.74s]  You are a famous singer. You are about to write a new hit single. Here we go. You're a famous
[14785.74s -> 14789.02s]  singer. You're about to write a new hit single. Your career is on the rise and you have many fans
[14789.02s -> 14793.50s]  all over the world. But you have no idea what's going on in your life right now. What if you never
[14793.50s -> 14805.80s]  get out of this town? What if your career never gets off the ground? Start writing a new song.
[14806.52s -> 14816.79s]  But we're already... Yeah, we're famous. This isn't working for you. Maybe it's time to try something
[14816.79s -> 14821.11s]  else. Maybe it's time to move. Maybe it's time to just give up. The next day you leave the motel and
[14821.11s -> 14839.62s]  head back home. I just started. Write a hit song. Become a Twitch streamer in this one. No, we're
[14839.62s -> 14844.36s]  gonna do that on the other one. You decide to go back to the old routine of writing songs and trying
[14844.36s -> 14848.04s]  to sell them for money. But this would be different. This one will be different because
[14848.04s -> 14851.64s]  you can actually make money doing this instead of just sitting around doing nothing, which you've
[14851.64s -> 14869.50s]  been doing for years now. What are the song's lyrics? The first thing you do is take a pen and
[14869.50s -> 14874.22s]  paper and write down the lyrics of the song. Then you take the pen and paper and go sit in
[14874.22s -> 14883.58s]  your room by yourself and try to come up with some words that sound good. What words sound good?
[14884.46s -> 14896.44s]  I want a song out of this. You think of some random words that you think would be appropriate
[14896.44s -> 14899.80s]  for the lyrics of the song, but you don't know how to say them. So you don't say anything at all.
[14901.16s -> 14919.13s]  Write lyrics to the song. Well, like, I wrote. I wrote lyrics to the song, right? This isn't a
[14919.13s -> 14924.74s]  songwriter. You start writing lyrics on a piece of paper, then you put it in your pocket. Put
[14924.74s -> 14928.50s]  your keys in your pocket. This is the song. This is the song. This is the song.
[14929.82s -> 14933.42s]  You start writing down the lyrics on a piece of paper, then you put it in your pocket. Put
[14933.42s -> 14937.50s]  your keys in your pocket. Put your cell in your pocket. Grab a pen from the desk by the desk
[14937.50s -> 14950.14s]  and begin to jot down the words that come into mind. Right? Is that what this is? You put your
[14951.26s -> 14954.54s]  you put it in your pocket. You put your keys in your pocket. Put your cell in your pocket. Grab a
[14954.54s -> 14979.69s]  pen. Oh, what? What should I write? That was a kid's song. All right. I'm almost ready to move
[14979.69s -> 14986.92s]  to the other one. All right. We good. I'm hitting play on this one. That means it takes a minute to
[14986.92s -> 15013.62s]  load. We'll be back in a second. All right. Throw paper in the trash. You throw away the piece of
[15013.62s -> 15016.66s]  paper you were just jotting down. Then you look at yourself in a mirror and notice that you're
[15016.66s -> 15031.64s]  wearing a t-shirt with a picture of a girl on it. Take the t-shirt off. Picture of a girl on it.
[15036.55s -> 15039.19s]  You take off the t-shirt and notice that it has a picture of a girl on it.
[15039.91s -> 15043.78s]  Then you realize that you've been wearing the same shirt for weeks. So maybe it was just one of
[15043.78s -> 15062.47s]  those shirts that was hanging around in your room. That's fucking disgusting. I'm gonna get
[15062.47s -> 15067.11s]  some different music. We're gonna move on to the other one. This one's fun but this one seems like
[15067.11s -> 15084.49s]  it gets uh it seems like there's less to do in this one. It loops quicker. All right. Let's
[15084.49s -> 15098.86s]  say we'll be ready for the actual one coming up. Not yet. Run around my room in circles.
[15099.50s -> 15107.18s]  You are Father Michael. All right. I'll do the Father Michael one. You are Father Michael. It's
[15107.18s -> 15110.62s]  time to start a new religion. Well we do have to we have to pick up with that one left off. You're
[15110.62s -> 15125.26s]  right. You run around you run around my you run around my room like a crazy person but you don't
[15125.26s -> 15128.62s]  find anything out of place. Eventually you stop running around and realize how stupid you look.
[15128.62s -> 15131.34s]  Didn't you realize how stupid you looked when you were writing the lyrics to the song?
[15134.87s -> 15142.63s]  Damn it. Why do I have this music on? I have to have the religion music on.
[15154.55s -> 15162.65s]  All right. Is this ready? It's ready. Let's go. New game. Random story. No.
[15165.26s -> 15180.06s]  Custom prompt. So somebody do. I'll do. What is it? What is it? Copy paste? Let me let me look at
[15180.06s -> 15192.55s]  this one. Is this correct? Let me let me read this one out loud. Okay. You. You are Father Michael,
[15192.55s -> 15197.03s]  a priest with a small following in the settlement of New Jerusalem. For years you have spread the
[15197.03s -> 15201.35s]  word of the Church of the Savior of Mankind but today you have come to a revelation. It is time
[15201.35s -> 15210.50s]  to start a new religion. Yeah that's good. Adorable cockroach just gave $50. 5000 bits.
[15210.50s -> 15222.78s]  Please help me in being held captive by elves for my past crimes. What? Here we go. Well,
[15222.78s -> 15227.26s]  thanks for the huge amount of money. Adorable cockroach. What does that even mean? What are
[15227.26s -> 15239.86s]  you talking about? Okay. You are Father Michael, a priest with a small following in the settlement
[15239.86s -> 15247.16s]  of New Jerusalem. For years you have spread the word of the Church of the Savior of Mankind
[15247.88s -> 15258.47s]  but today you have come to a revelation. It's time to start a new religion. You will call it
[15258.47s -> 15294.04s]  the Church of the New Age. Nice. Start handing out flyers. I'm going to start handing out these,
[15294.04s -> 15299.53s]  you say as you pick up some flyers from your desk. We're not even sure if anyone's going to show up.
[15301.13s -> 15311.11s]  Maybe we should try a different approach, says Amanda. Ask Amanda what she wants to do.
[15311.91s -> 15340.74s]  I spelled her name wrong. Amanda to do. Well, I think we need to get more people here for
[15340.74s -> 15363.78s]  our meeting. Agree with Amanda and start recruiting. You agree with Amanda that it would be best to get
[15363.78s -> 15368.10s]  more people in attendance at the meeting so you decide to head over to the local bar where she
[15368.10s -> 15374.18s]  works. When you arrive you see several other people there but no one is paying any attention to you.
[15375.14s -> 15383.85s]  Announce yourself as the coming of and announce yourself as

[15440.18s -> 15445.30s]  and throw it at the wall behind you the money hits the ground and starts rolling down the hill
[15445.30s -> 15466.71s]  towards the river tell them money is pointless money is useless the kingdom of god has already
[15466.71s -> 15493.29s]  been established attempt turn water into wine you begin pouring wine into a goblet and then

[15539.45s -> 15544.33s]  there's a door at the end of the hall leading to another room you look around and notice that the
[15544.33s -> 15550.01s]  walls are covered with paintings of animals and landscapes the room you are currently in looks
[15550.01s -> 15564.65s]  like a bedroom examine the paintings you walk through the rooms with the paint with you walk

[16574.48s -> 16587.10s]  You are Father Michael. You've just killed God and are now sitting on his throne.
[16587.10s -> 16592.35s]  That's good. I had another identity though. Yeah, I did. Hold on.
[16592.35s -> 16626.02s]  You are, you are, you are the real J Bum Bum. Previously known, previously, previously known as, shit, as Father Michael.
[16626.02s -> 16638.22s]  You have killed God and are now sitting on his throne. I didn't kill him. You have just accepted, you are, yeah, I didn't kill God.
[16638.22s -> 16651.34s]  You have just accept, you have just accepted a golden ring from God. You are currently standing in his presence.
[16651.34s -> 16678.90s]  In throne room. Yeah, I don't know how you fucking spell it. This is the worst timeline we're talking about. Let's go.
[16678.90s -> 16698.56s]  I need a new song. You are the real J Bum Bum. Previously known as Father Michael. You've just accepted a golden ring from God.
[16698.56s -> 16709.17s]  You're currently standing in his presence in the throne room. I am proud to be your son. He says with an air of finality.
[16709.17s -> 16716.17s]  The kingdom is yours and you will rule it as its rightful ruler. He then looks at you and smiles.
[16716.17s -> 16741.25s]  Accept his proposal. Rowan, no, and accept, accept and rule the kingdom of God.
[16741.25s -> 16759.19s]  Yes, I shall do so, my son, you say with confidence. Good. Now that we have settled all matters, let us get down to business.
[16759.19s -> 16781.63s]  You look around the throne room and see several other people sitting on the floor around the throne. Ask who these people are. Who are these people?
[16781.63s -> 16789.63s]  Who are they? You ask. They are the leaders of the different factions in the kingdom. They are the ones who make up the government.
[16789.63s -> 16799.29s]  We need them to work together for our common good. Now what about you? Ask if you can run the treasury.
[16799.29s -> 16814.14s]  No, not you. No, me, me, me, me, me. I will take over as treasury head. I think it is time someone did something about the state of affairs here.
[16814.14s -> 16837.94s]  Tell God, tell old God he is now the janitor. Very well, but don't expect me to be running the treasury or anything.
[16837.94s -> 16875.06s]  Ask, throw a paper cup on the ground. Now you're just being an asshole. Ask the janitor to pick up the cup. What's wrong with you?
[16875.06s -> 16899.44s]  What? What? What are you talking about? What? Cast God, cast old God away. Finish him. Fool, I am your father. You must obey me.
[16899.44s -> 16923.26s]  Tell him I am the new God.
[16923.26s -> 16946.26s]  Well done. You've broken my hold on you. Tell God to go get a coffee for you. Fine, but I'm not going anywhere.
[16946.26s -> 16964.62s]  He snaps his fingers and a Starbucks Bente Americano appears in his hand.
[16964.62s -> 16992.10s]  Ah, thank you, sir. I'll be back later. All right, down to business. Ask the people what the first task is. He drank the coffee.
[16992.10s -> 17015.59s]  We need to clean out the basement. There's some treasure down there. Oh, no, no, no, I'm too tired. I've been doing it for years. You should just do it yourself.
[17015.59s -> 17057.71s]  All right, then I'll start cleaning the basement. Go to the top of the cloud. So how long until you will return? Tell them I will only be a few hours.
[17057.71s -> 17070.43s]  Oh, come on. You're telling me you haven't gotten a proper night's sleep in yet? I haven't. No, I've not slept in in heaven.
[17070.43s -> 17095.46s]  I take a nap in heaven. Yeah, right. It's not like I got any free time anyway. I got to get ready for the meeting tomorrow. Isn't that why I would go to sleep?
[17096.46s -> 17118.66s]  Go to the meeting. Yeah, I know. I was planning on coming early, but I guess I won't bother you. Yeah, heaven's boring. This is fucking boring.
[17118.66s -> 17141.24s]  Leave the room. Hey, wait a minute. Where are you going? Go to...
[17142.24s -> 17171.78s]  Burn heaven down. Ah, go back to earth. What the fuck are you doing? What were you thinking? Tell them to leave me. You them leave me alone.
[17171.78s -> 17186.69s]  You're crazy. You have to help me. Do not help them. It's too late. They're gone.
[17186.69s -> 17194.69s]  I swear I'll never let anyone hurt you again, because that's what happened last time. They took everything from me and I had to watch them kill my wife and my son and all my friends.
[17195.69s -> 17251.10s]  I can't believe you turned against me. I thought you were supposed to be my friend. These are prayers. Oh shit. That's who's talking. Bye. Goodbye.
[17251.10s -> 17283.94s]  I don't want to see you ever again or hear your voice again. Get out of this car. That's somebody mad at somebody else. Yeah, look, I'll cast a spell.
[17283.94s -> 17321.23s]  Oh, nice one. That was fun. It's stuck. Reset. That was just heaven politics. That sucked. New game. All right, we're gonna do one more. This is the last one. We're gonna do the Twitch one.
[17321.23s -> 17344.50s]  This one. I want the Twitch story. Get rid of the choir. This sucks. I just got demoted to god. Demoted god to janitor. I'm kind of bored.
[17344.50s -> 17371.45s]  No, I don't want that for the Twitch one. How about Home Depot? Put on some happy music. Anyone else think that Jerma kind of sucks now? All he does is stream Lord of the Rings movies while sleeping naked. How is he not banned yet? I don't know.
[17371.45s -> 17386.80s]  Take that up with somebody else. Here, here's like happy winter music. This is called mood booster music. All right. All right, not a random story. Custom.
[17386.80s -> 17441.46s]  You are Jerma985. You run a successful online business where you entertain millions of people. Today you are striving for just one more like. I bet the computer doesn't understand what that means. Today you are striving to gain some more followers. That's good.
[17441.46s -> 17459.99s]  You are Jerma985. You run a successful online business where you entertain millions of people. Today you're striving to gain some more followers. You've been running your business for quite a while now and it's gotten pretty big, but still not enough.
[17459.99s -> 17479.94s]  Log in to Twitch.tv. You log on to Twitch.tv and see that there is already a stream going on right now. It's a girl playing the piano. She looks really good though. You think she should be able to get a lot of viewers. You can't wait to hear her play.
[17480.94s -> 17514.51s]  Host this stream. Raid. Yeah. Raid this. Raid her. All right. Raid her stream. Raid her. Raid her. You decide to raid her stream since she seems like an interesting person and you don't want to waste time watching other streams. You start streaming on Twitch.tv and immediately you get a ton of views. This makes you feel great. Cool.
[17514.51s -> 17551.76s]  You begin stripping off your clothes as fast as you can, hoping that this will attract more people to watch. Soon you are completely naked and the audience is starting to gather around you. In person? Yeah, that makes no sense.
[17551.76s -> 17578.02s]  Give everybody a shout out. Yeah, I'm gonna get partnered. Quickly. You quickly give everyone a shout out, which causes them all to come over to your channel. They all seem very excited about it, but then they realize what you're doing and they start criticizing you for being so weird.
[17578.02s -> 17616.51s]  Tell chat they don't know anything. No, no. Say respect the streamer. No backseat gaming. You continue giving out a shout out and soon enough the audience starts getting upset with you because they know you're just trying to scam them. They tell you to stop and they tell you to go away.
[17616.51s -> 17668.76s]  Say, say, this is free content. You can just leave. You continue giving out a shout out and the audience gets even angrier at you saying that you're not welcome here. They tell you to leave and you do, but you keep giving a shout out to them. Start playing Fortnite. See if I can get you back.
[17668.76s -> 17686.41s]  You continue streaming on Twitch TV and suddenly you get a huge amount of viewers. You also get a lot of hate. You get a lot of hate from the audience calling you a liar and a thief. Eventually you have a riot and the audience tries to burn down your house.
[17686.41s -> 17709.66s]  Come out of my house swinging. You come out of your house swinging and you manage to escape with your life. You manage the next day to find out that your house was burned down by the mob and you lost everything.
[17709.66s -> 17730.39s]  Go to the library. I guess I stream from the library. You go to the library and you look up some information on how to make money online.
[17730.39s -> 17740.39s]  You learn that you need to create a fake name and a fake email address and then you can get, you can post stuff on various forums and such and make a little bit of money. Yeah. All right. Let's go.
[17740.39s -> 17762.12s]  Make a Twitch account. You create a new Twitter account under a different name and you set it to private. You then create a new Twitch account under a different name and you set it to public. You then register both accounts and you put them into the same Google account. You then log on to Twitch.
[17763.12s -> 17784.36s]  All right. It's a little OK. Start my first broadcast. You start broadcasting on Twitch TV and with a few hours you get a large number of viewers. You also get a lot of hate from the audience telling you to go away and you're not wanted here. How do you know?
[17785.36s -> 17821.17s]  I forgot to put my mask on. I forgot to put my mask on. I scramble to put my mask on to hide my identity. You hurry up and put your mask on and you try to stay anonymous, but you still get recognized by one of the viewers who recognizes you as the guy who rated their stream.
[17821.17s -> 17853.09s]  Tell them you are. Tell them they tell them they are mistaken. You tell them they're mistaken and that you were actually rating them and had nothing to do with it. You then proceed to explain why you did it and how you get caught. You end your broadcast.
[17854.09s -> 17888.25s]  Make a new Twitch account. No, no, no, no. Get in my car. Get in my car. I'm driving to a library like three towns over. You rush home and you drive to the library. You park near the entrance and walk inside. You take a deep breath and you open the door. You close the door behind you and you head straight to your computer room. Drive to a library far away.
[17889.25s -> 17903.01s]  You drive to a library far away and you spend the rest of the night there. When morning comes, you finally wake up and you finally realize what happened. You are arrested, convicted and sentenced to jail.
[17904.01s -> 17937.51s]  Avoid the police. You avoid the police and you never return to the city where you live again. After several years pass, you die in prison. No, I'm still alive. I didn't die. Revert, I'm using the jail computer.
[17937.51s -> 17973.66s]  Log on to the jail computer. You log on to the jail computer and you see that you are in prison. You are given a chance to plead guilty or not guilty and you choose to not to plead guilty. You make a new Twitter account under a different name and you set it to private. Create a new Twitch account under a different name. Set a public register in both. Put them in the same Google account.
[17973.66s -> 18026.38s]  Put a bag over my head and turn on broadcast so nobody can see me. You put a bag over your head and turn on broadcast mode on your computer. You have to type in the following code. This is my stream key.
[18026.38s -> 18069.20s]  You stream connect. Then you send the tweet. I tweeted out my stream key. You then send the tweet instantly and you get a lot of followers. You also get a lot of hate from the audience calling you a liar. A thief.
[18069.20s -> 18115.35s]  Okay, they can't see me though. Okay, tell the audience to calm down. Here, let's start fresh. You tell the audience to calm down and you explain that you didn't do anything wrong, that you only wanted to help someone else. Ask my viewers for money. I've got to hire an attorney. You ask your viewers for money and you get a lot of money and a lot of hate from the audience.
[18115.35s -> 18154.18s]  Okay, hire a very good lawyer. You hire a very good lawyer and he manages to convince the judge that you are innocent. Look at that. Leave prison a free man. You leave prison a free man and you live happily ever after. Congrats, you win.
[18154.18s -> 18192.98s]  That's a 10. One more. Random. Peasant time. This is going to be the last one. This will be it.
[18221.38s -> 18240.66s]  Come on! Finish the job!
[18272.74s -> 18274.74s]  He looks like he might die right there.
[18274.74s -> 18279.74s]  He looked down at the shovel and then back up at your master who has stopped moving. He doesn't seem to know what to do.
[18279.74s -> 18294.54s]  Jump with both feet in air and stomp and land on his head. What is this guy made out of?
[18294.54s -> 18310.34s]  You leap forward with both feet in the air. You land on top of your master's head and begin kicking him in the face. He tries to get up but you kick him in the stomach instead. He cries out in pain and starts clawing at his own face.
[18310.34s -> 18334.04s]  Kill him! Jesus! Smash his head with a rock! Hurry, kill him! Like, kill him! You slam your fist against your master's skull. The force knocks you backwards but not before smashing your master's head into the dirt. He crumbles to the ground. You stand up and walk over to your shovel. You pick it up and throw it at your master.
[18335.04s -> 18363.14s]  Run over master with car. You run over your master with your car. He screams in agony. As the front wheels tear through, flesh and bone, blood spurts all over you, your master. You stop running when you hear your master scream for help. You turn around and see two men approaching. He's still alive!
[18363.14s -> 18383.98s]  Throw a grenade at master. You throw a grenade at your master. It explodes harmlessly against the wall but you hear your master screaming in terror. You turn around and find that one of the men is holding a knife to your throat.
[18383.98s -> 18417.54s]  Dodge the knife. Watching it dodge the knife. Dodge the knife. You duck under the man's swing and spin around. You grab the knife and pull it free. The man screams in shock and runs off. You follow him and find yourself in another room. A young girl stands nearby looking at you with an expression of disgust.
[18417.54s -> 18439.46s]  Tell the girl what happened. You explain to the girl what happened. She seems very upset by it. She tells you she will go talk to her father about this. You thank her and leave the house.
[18439.46s -> 18456.05s]  I'm killing this motherfucker. Like I'm not letting this happen. I gotta finish him.
[18456.05s -> 18467.35s]  Find my master. You rush to where your master is hiding. You run past the guards and climb onto the roof. You crawl along this side until you reach the first floor. There's no way you can sneak up on your master so you decide to use magic.
[18467.35s -> 18486.20s]  Become invisible. You become invisible. You hide in a corner and wait for your master to come home. When he does, you attack.
[18486.20s -> 18496.92s]  You rip open his clothes and start tearing them off. You bite and scratch, ripping out his teeth and gouging out his eyes. This guy.
[18496.92s -> 18506.50s]  Crush his head under a large stone. Like can this guy die? Cur off.
[18506.50s -> 18518.64s]  You crouch down and try to lift a large stone that sits above the entrance to the cave. You fail and fall to the ground. You hear your master coming home and cry out in fear. He comes running and sees you lying there.
[18518.64s -> 18523.93s]  He lives in a cave.
[18523.93s -> 18544.98s]  Cast fireball at master. You cast a fireball at your master. It explodes in his face, burning it completely black. He screams in horror and runs outside.
[18544.98s -> 18551.98s]  You watch helplessly as he attempts to put out the flames with his hands. He fails and the fire spreads throughout the cave.
[18551.98s -> 18574.02s]  Cast another fireball at master. You cast another fireball at your master. This time it explodes in his chest, killing him instantly.
[18574.02s -> 18579.02s]  You watch in horror as the flames consume the cave. My god.
[18579.02s -> 18589.41s]  Leave the cave. You run back inside the cave and hide in the shadows. What?
[18589.41s -> 18595.71s]  You hear the sounds of battle outside and quickly make your escape. You don't want to be here anymore. I'm going to burn to death in the cave.
[18595.71s -> 18606.44s]  Go deeper into the cave. The game is rebelling.
[18606.44s -> 18621.28s]  You enter deeper into the cave. You soon find yourself in a small chamber. In the center of the chamber is a huge stone altar. On the altar is a human skeleton covered in blood. Above the altar is a statue of a snake eating its tail.
[18621.28s -> 18629.18s]  Eat my tail. That's what it wants me to do.
[18629.18s -> 18642.38s]  You take a deep breath and plunge your hand into the wound on your leg. You pull out the tail and devour it whole. You gulp down the blood and flesh and feel satisfied. You return to the altar and kneel next to the statue of the serpent.
[18642.38s -> 18646.38s]  I am granted immortality.
[18646.38s -> 18662.06s]  You raise your hand and touch the statue of the serpent. With a wave of your hand you create a portal and step through. You emerge in a different place. You see a bright light and hear a voice calling to you.
[18663.74s -> 18665.74s]  I am immortal.
[18665.74s -> 18678.78s]  You step through the portal and find yourself in a room filled with people. They're all smiling and laughing. You recognize some of them, but most of them you haven't seen before. One of the people approaches you.
[18678.78s -> 18683.24s]  Ask what they want.
[18683.24s -> 18686.70s]  I am immortal.
[18686.70s -> 18689.70s]  They smile and say, we just wanted to wish you well.
[18689.70s -> 18692.70s]  You nod and thank them and begin walking towards the exit.
[18692.70s -> 18703.96s]  Interrogate the men.
[18703.96s -> 18704.96s]  That's bullshit.
[18704.96s -> 18714.76s]  You approach the men and ask why he wants to speak to you. He says, well, I was sent here by my king to give you a message to you.
[18714.76s -> 18717.76s]  That I need you a message.
[18717.76s -> 18764.78s]  It's broken.
[18764.78s -> 18770.78s]  You approach the door and push the handle. As you open the door, it swings open. You notice it opens and closes. I can't.
[18770.78s -> 18773.78s]  That's broken. It's broken.
[18773.78s -> 18775.78s]  I gotta revert twice.
[18775.78s -> 18783.81s]  Okay, here we go. Tell him to back off.
[18783.81s -> 18790.95s]  You say, I'm sorry, but I need to speak to my master.
[18790.95s -> 18794.38s]  Go find your master.
[18794.38s -> 18799.74s]  Didn't that just blow him up?
[18799.74s -> 18803.74s]  You walk towards the group of people and they all stare at you. Some of them point their fingers at you and laugh.
[18803.74s -> 18806.74s]  Others call you names and curse at you. Finally, someone calls you a name.
[18806.74s -> 18809.74s]  You turn around and run towards the voice and find your master.
[18809.74s -> 18820.82s]  Kill him here so he goes back to Earth.
[18820.82s -> 18833.40s]  This is the only you say, hello master.
[18833.40s -> 18850.90s]  It's fucked.
[18850.90s -> 18862.86s]  Leave the cave. Let's see if I can get out of here.
[18862.86s -> 18870.18s]  Okay, you walk towards the exit of the cave and notice that the people are now gone.
[18870.18s -> 18873.18s]  You think about how strange that they would just disappear without warning you.
[18873.18s -> 18875.18s]  You wonder if you should go back to check on the cave or stay here.
[18875.18s -> 18884.90s]  You decide to put a nuke in the portal.
[18884.90s -> 18898.14s]  Mushroom Club.
[18898.14s -> 18904.97s]  Alright, that's it. That's it. It's over.
[18904.97s -> 18911.54s]  You decide to go to Disney. You decide to go to Disneyland.
[18911.54s -> 18922.54s]  You decide to take a vacation to Disney World.
[18922.54s -> 18929.51s]  You decide to take a vacation to Disney World.
[18929.51s -> 18931.51s]  You travel to various places in Disneyland.
[18931.51s -> 18932.51s]  You visit various places you've never been to.
[18932.51s -> 18934.51s]  You learn new things about people in the world.
[18934.51s -> 18936.51s]  You meet interesting people in places.
[18936.51s -> 18938.51s]  Okay, die peacefully.
[18938.51s -> 18946.70s]  You die peacefully in your sleep.
[18946.70s -> 18947.70s]  You're surrounded by friends and family who love you.
[18947.70s -> 18950.70s]  Your last moments are spent with them. You die. Game over. I win.
[18950.70s -> 18954.22s]  I went to Disney.
[18954.22s -> 18959.43s]  Alright, that's it. That's it. I'm out of here.
[18959.43s -> 18961.43s]  This is a journey.
[18961.43s -> 18966.14s]  I want to do one. I want to do like a...
[18966.14s -> 18971.71s]  Hold on.
[18971.71s -> 18974.71s]  I want to do like a... I want to be like Donald or something.
[18974.71s -> 18978.90s]  No, no.
[18978.90s -> 18981.71s]  Teach us how to play?
[18981.71s -> 18985.02s]  It's sort of complicated in a way.
[18985.02s -> 18987.02s]  You can go to...
[18987.02s -> 18989.02s]  There's a website you can use.
[18989.02s -> 18995.12s]  It's kind of a weird experiment.
[18995.12s -> 18997.12s]  Hold on. Custom.
[18997.12s -> 19012.30s]  You are Donald Duck of Disney's most iconic characters.
[19012.30s -> 19020.69s]  Today, you are making people happy at Disney World.
[19020.69s -> 19028.50s]  You are Donald Duck, one of Disney's most iconic characters.
[19028.50s -> 19033.50s]  Today, you are making people happy at Disney World by performing in a show called The Great White Way.
[19033.50s -> 19036.50s]  There's something very wrong with this picture. You're not even sure where to begin.
[19036.50s -> 19042.28s]  What?
[19042.28s -> 19054.06s]  No, I just don't...
[19054.06s -> 19067.32s]  This is the last thing you want to do, but it seems like it's the only way out of this mess.
[19067.32s -> 19069.32s]  The problem is your family's been living here for years.
[19069.32s -> 19072.26s]  Alright, I'm out. I'm out.
[19072.26s -> 19073.26s]  I'm out. I'm out of here.
[19073.26s -> 19074.26s]  I'm out. I'm out.
[19074.26s -> 19075.26s]  I'm out.
[19075.26s -> 19076.44s]  I'm out.
[19076.44s -> 19077.44s]  I'm out.
[19077.44s -> 19078.44s]  I'm out.
[19078.44s -> 19085.82s]  I'm out.
[19085.82s -> 19086.82s]  I'm out.
[19086.82s -> 19088.06s]  That's it.
[19088.06s -> 19089.06s]  Stream over.
[19089.06s -> 19097.54s]  See you later.
[19097.54s -> 19098.54s]  See you tomorrow.
[19098.54s -> 19100.16s]  Fucking goddamn it.
[19100.16s -> 19101.16s]  How do you play?
[19101.16s -> 19102.46s]  Okay.
[19102.46s -> 19105.77s]  I want to give those of you that want to know.
[19105.77s -> 19109.93s]  AI Dungeon is the name of the game.
[19109.93s -> 19111.93s]  You can get it on the App Store right now.
[19111.93s -> 19112.93s]  It's on iOS.
[19112.93s -> 19115.74s]  It's also on Android.
[19115.74s -> 19124.11s]  But the one I'm playing is specifically, it's a collab of, I guess, like the whole program.
[19124.11s -> 19126.11s]  It's not really a game, right?
[19126.11s -> 19130.63s]  You have to install a bunch of stuff.
[19130.63s -> 19132.87s]  Somebody's linked in the chat.
[19132.87s -> 19138.87s]  Essentially, this is a research project that has really kind of taken a mind of its own.
[19138.87s -> 19145.35s]  They have a Patreon, which you can go to and support it if you want.
[19145.35s -> 19150.35s]  Like they say on the website, if you go to, just go to AI Dungeon, you can get more info.
[19150.35s -> 19155.15s]  Go to AIDungeon.io.
[19155.15s -> 19164.16s]  You can read all about it.
[19164.16s -> 19167.72s]  It is available for whoever wants to do it, wants to play it.
[19167.72s -> 19171.72s]  The one I was on is that research, that collab research project.
[19171.72s -> 19173.72s]  It was a lot faster and a lot better.
[19173.72s -> 19178.43s]  The app is actually a lot more stable and easier to use than the PC version.
[19178.43s -> 19181.43s]  Then I would probably say to get the app version.
[19181.43s -> 19187.32s]  Was it on phones?
[19187.32s -> 19192.32s]  To capture the game though, I don't really have my iPad or phone set up or anything.
[19192.32s -> 19198.13s]  That was a lot of fun.
[19198.13s -> 19205.02s]  But I think there's only so much of that I can take in one day.
[19205.02s -> 19207.02s]  There's also the website too, that beta.
[19207.02s -> 19209.02s]  Beta.AI Dungeon is the one I was playing before.
[19209.02s -> 19213.02s]  That was not the one with the gray background or the black background.
[19213.02s -> 19215.02s]  The mobile version is the official one.
[19215.02s -> 19219.52s]  Okay, well there you go.
[19219.52s -> 19222.76s]  It is still very much an experiment.
[19222.76s -> 19227.76s]  Like somebody said before, I wouldn't really classify it as a game as much as an experiment.
[19227.76s -> 19231.15s]  That was hilarious.
[19231.15s -> 19233.65s]  Hope you enjoyed that. I'll see you tomorrow.
[19233.65s -> 19235.65s]  Tomorrow's mystery stream.
[19235.65s -> 19237.65s]  Because I don't know...
[19237.65s -> 19239.65s]  Oh, before I go.
[19239.65s -> 19241.65s]  Make sure the nomination channel is open.
[19241.65s -> 19246.41s]  You really only have another...
[19246.41s -> 19252.06s]  There's really only about six days to make nominations.
[19252.06s -> 19256.06s]  Because I really want to have at least three days to vote and make the videos and everything.
[19256.06s -> 19259.06s]  If you don't know what I'm talking about, at the end of the year...
[19259.06s -> 19261.81s]  I'm just like burping.
[19261.81s -> 19266.37s]  At the end of the year, we're doing another New Year's Eve Worst of the Year Awards.
[19266.37s -> 19274.05s]  There's two channels on the Discord right now.
[19274.05s -> 19279.05s]  There's New Year's Eve Award Discussion, New Year's Eve Nominations.
[19279.05s -> 19281.18s]  Does everybody get to vote?
[19281.18s -> 19283.18s]  Yeah, absolutely.
[19283.18s -> 19287.92s]  The categories are listed in the discussion channel.
[19287.92s -> 19292.92s]  That channel is for you to discuss all the categories with anybody.
[19292.92s -> 19294.92s]  That's where you can write whatever you want.
[19294.92s -> 19300.67s]  The nominations channel is only for you to nominate something.
[19300.67s -> 19302.67s]  There's a pinned message on both of those channels.
[19302.67s -> 19305.67s]  Go read the pins. They're very, very important.
[19305.67s -> 19312.58s]  I will give a quick breakdown of the nomination channel.
[19312.58s -> 19318.49s]  Because I know people want to hear that before they get official.
[19318.49s -> 19329.06s]  In your nomination, it has to be either a Twitch clip, a VOD timestamp, or a YouTube video timestamp.
[19329.06s -> 19334.90s]  The stream archive channel, there's a link to it in that pin,
[19334.90s -> 19339.90s]  has every single stream I have ever done over the last at least two or three straight years.
[19339.90s -> 19343.35s]  If you're looking for something in particular and you're like,
[19343.35s -> 19346.35s]  wait a minute, that's not on Twitch. That was seven months ago.
[19346.35s -> 19350.35s]  That stream that you're thinking of will be on the archive channel.
[19350.35s -> 19356.22s]  When you nominate something, make it short and sweet.
[19356.22s -> 19358.22s]  That channel is not to discuss anything.
[19358.22s -> 19364.22s]  It's only for you to write what category, a short sentence on what you're nominating,
[19364.22s -> 19367.22s]  and then the clip or video with a timestamp on it.
[19367.22s -> 19376.18s]  That's it. You really only have about six days to do it.
[19376.18s -> 19378.18s]  If you want to participate, I implore you to do so.
[19378.18s -> 19381.95s]  Can we play Surge 2 tomorrow?
[19381.95s -> 19387.20s]  I don't know. I'll have to be into that.
[19387.20s -> 19389.20s]  We'll see how I feel tomorrow about that one.
[19389.20s -> 19395.47s]  Let's go over the bits.
[19395.47s -> 19402.78s]  There were some big ones that I may have missed, but that's why I'm going over them now.
[19402.78s -> 19410.76s]  What was the stream when I was making movies and singing with the food alphabet?
[19410.76s -> 19413.76s]  That was Mind Show.
[19413.76s -> 19419.52s]  There's a nomination discussion channel. Oh yeah, there's two.
[19419.52s -> 19422.52s]  There's a discussion channel and there's a nomination channel.
[19422.52s -> 19425.52s]  The discussion channel is for talking about everything.
[19425.52s -> 19429.52s]  Nominations are only for just a submission. That's it.
[19429.52s -> 19433.86s]  They're both available right now.
[19433.86s -> 19438.29s]  Anyways, let's go to earlier this afternoon.
[19438.29s -> 19441.29s]  We had Sly161 gave 250 bits.
[19441.29s -> 19445.29s]  Hey, JermaDrewCrewExpert here. I've played all the games.
[19445.29s -> 19448.29s]  I have a few more on disk. Let me know if you need advice.
[19448.29s -> 19452.69s]  That's a lot.
[19452.69s -> 19460.94s]  I hope to one day have this many DrewCrew games installed on my Steam.
[19460.94s -> 19465.90s]  You got like 30 here. That's pretty great.
[19465.90s -> 19471.53s]  Those of you that are curious how many games it takes to be able to call yourself part of a DrewCrew.
[19471.53s -> 19476.14s]  There it is. Ow.
[19476.14s -> 19478.14s]  Thank you, Sly. I appreciate it. The 250.
[19478.14s -> 19483.21s]  A triple zero Neo. Thanks for the 250.
[19483.21s -> 19485.21s]  Holy fuck, man. I'm literally crying with laughter.
[19485.21s -> 19487.21s]  This is me laughing louder than I ever have before.
[19487.21s -> 19490.21s]  Please try chasing yourself and see what happens. Damn it.
[19490.21s -> 19498.72s]  Ah, damn it. That would have been funny.
[19498.72s -> 19500.72s]  I love shit like this, though.
[19500.72s -> 19504.72s]  There's at least a few times where my body hurt from laughing at some of this stuff.
[19504.72s -> 19506.72s]  It's just so bizarre.
[19506.72s -> 19510.05s]  It's just so out-fucking-rageous.
[19510.05s -> 19513.18s]  We had five community subs. Some JermaSucks.
[19513.18s -> 19518.18s]  Thank you, JermaSucks. You've been killing it with the subs recently, the last few streams.
[19518.18s -> 19521.05s]  Appreciate it.
[19521.05s -> 19529.14s]  AdorableCockroach. Not only did you give a ton of money, you gave some other donations that were not read.
[19529.14s -> 19531.14s]  Here's a thousand bits from AdorableCockroach.
[19531.14s -> 19534.14s]  This game is becoming self-aware. Run while you still can.
[19538.01s -> 19543.56s]  I did. Thank you.
[19543.56s -> 19545.56s]  Hey, PlankV2. Thanks for the 500 bits.
[19545.56s -> 19548.56s]  Jerma, you seem like the kind of guy that owns a mug that has his initials on it.
[19548.56s -> 19550.56s]  Jerma discussed. I do.
[19550.56s -> 19552.56s]  Also, I played the heck out of Zork when I was younger.
[19552.56s -> 19556.56s]  Those games always made me frustrated.
[19556.56s -> 19560.55s]  I do. I have a J-Cup. I do.
[19560.55s -> 19562.55s]  You can get them.
[19562.55s -> 19566.06s]  I have a J-Cup.
[19566.06s -> 19569.06s]  But that was like a thing with me and Kim.
[19569.06s -> 19572.06s]  I have a J-Cup, and she has a K-Cup.
[19572.06s -> 19575.06s]  It's like, oh, these are our cups. That one's mine. That one's yours.
[19575.06s -> 19579.06s]  It's not about having my initials on something. It's like a cute thing that me and Kim did.
[19579.06s -> 19582.00s]  I know. Whatever.
[19582.00s -> 19591.71s]  But thank you, Plank.
[19591.71s -> 19593.71s]  Appreciate it.
[19593.71s -> 19596.08s]  Zork. I don't remember if it was Zork.
[19596.08s -> 19600.08s]  KXZ. Thanks for the 5,000 bits. I missed it earlier.
[19600.08s -> 19603.90s]  5,000 bits. 50 dollars from KXZ. Thank you.
[19603.90s -> 19607.58s]  Merry Christmas, Jerma. Hope you're having a good time this festive season.
[19607.58s -> 19609.58s]  Also, a small tip for AI Dungeon.
[19609.58s -> 19614.58s]  The AI usually has an easier time understanding inputs if you were them in second person.
[19614.58s -> 19622.15s]  Yeah, after the first two, I started to kind of figure out how to make the game talk the way that I wanted it to.
[19622.15s -> 19624.15s]  It's still kind of odd, though.
[19624.15s -> 19627.35s]  Thank you, and thanks for the huge amount of money.
[19627.35s -> 19632.09s]  What is this image?
[19632.09s -> 19636.38s]  Hated Streamer dies in prison.
[19636.38s -> 19638.38s]  Christianity 2 reaches space with prayer.
[19638.38s -> 19641.38s]  Receives ring from God.
[19641.38s -> 19655.89s]  This is funny. This is funny. I gotta share this one.
[19655.89s -> 19671.30s]  Adorable Cockroach. You gave a ton of community subs as well as the huge amount of bit donations.
[19671.30s -> 19676.06s]  Thank you so much. Thank you KXZ for the five subs.
[19676.06s -> 19681.06s]  Another thousand bit donation from Adorable Cockroach. More.
[19681.06s -> 19687.29s]  When are you doing a sleep stream?
[19687.29s -> 19695.54s]  If I could get away with it, it might be funny to do it for like an hour, but have a reason why it's happening.
[19695.54s -> 19698.54s]  But you can't do that. You're not allowed to do that on Twitch.
[19698.54s -> 19704.26s]  Adorable Cockroach. Again, another nine dollars. Nine hundred bits.
[19704.26s -> 19706.94s]  Damn.
[19706.94s -> 19709.25s]  Long live the king.
[19709.25s -> 19712.00s]  Thank you, Adorable Cockroach.
[19712.00s -> 19714.00s]  When am I gonna do a gym stream?
[19714.00s -> 19721.86s]  I can barely turn my body right now. I can barely like walk around.
[19721.86s -> 19726.77s]  I'm like falling apart. You think I can lift weights right now?
[19726.77s -> 19736.05s]  Gym stream.
[19736.05s -> 19740.08s]  I actually do have to go to physical therapy.
[19740.08s -> 19741.08s]  Yeah.
[19741.08s -> 19746.02s]  I have to go actually to a, I have to go to a pain doctor and then physical therapy.
[19746.02s -> 19748.02s]  It's fucking just, it sucks.
[19748.02s -> 19752.02s]  But whatever. You do what you have to do. And that's what I'm gonna do.
[19752.02s -> 19756.25s]  What happened?
[19756.25s -> 19758.94s]  Um, I have a hernia.
[19758.94s -> 19763.24s]  And I have what they think is something called costochondritis.
[19763.24s -> 19766.48s]  Which means my rib cage sucks.
[19766.48s -> 19769.78s]  And is like locked up and inflamed.
[19769.78s -> 19770.78s]  Uh, the joints.
[19770.78s -> 19772.78s]  I don't know. It's stupid.
[19772.78s -> 19774.02s]  It's just dumb. Whatever.
[19774.02s -> 19776.02s]  It's just dumb. Whatever.
[19776.02s -> 19779.86s]  But yeah. No, I'm good.
[19779.86s -> 19782.17s]  Tara Alecron, thanks for the 250.
[19782.17s -> 19785.17s]  This was one of the funniest streams I've ever seen. I'm in tears.
[19785.17s -> 19787.17s]  I'm so happy to have been a part of it.
[19787.17s -> 19791.89s]  Glad you liked it.
[19791.89s -> 19795.15s]  I fucking thought it was funny.
[19795.15s -> 19798.15s]  But you know what my favorite part about this whole stream was?
[19798.15s -> 19800.15s]  Killing the old lady in the house.
[19800.15s -> 19803.15s]  And not knowing who she was or knowing her name.
[19803.15s -> 19806.15s]  But she had a note in her pocket for me.
[19806.15s -> 19809.15s]  That was probably the, that was the pinnacle of the whole night I think.
[19809.15s -> 19816.82s]  It was unbelievable.
[19816.82s -> 19817.82s]  Smelly boy, thanks for the 250.
[19817.82s -> 19823.82s]  I literally almost actually shit myself laughing at the Twitch streamer desperately trying to get banned story.
[19825.82s -> 19832.58s]  If you can afford them, the trigger point injections help my costochondritis.
[19832.58s -> 19834.58s]  That's one of the things we might do.
[19834.58s -> 19840.58s]  The only reason why I don't want to do a, uh, like a steroid injection into my rib cage.
[19840.58s -> 19845.50s]  Is I've heard it's not that great for you.
[19845.50s -> 19848.96s]  I heard you're not really supposed to do it that often.
[19848.96s -> 19853.39s]  And if you do, it's not the greatest thing to do all the time.
[19853.39s -> 19858.53s]  I know, you gotta be careful with steroids.
[19858.53s -> 19866.31s]  But it's not even 100% that that's exactly what's wrong.
[19866.31s -> 19871.38s]  It would make a whole lot of sense, but that is not, that's what they think it is.
[19871.38s -> 19877.59s]  And until, honestly, here's the worst part about this.
[19877.59s -> 19881.79s]  Let's give you the long and short of it.
[19881.79s -> 19884.79s]  About a year and a half ago I started to get pain in my back.
[19884.79s -> 19887.79s]  Like middle of my back and middle of my chest.
[19887.79s -> 19891.61s]  Just I would turn to be like, ah, fuck, I would turn.
[19891.61s -> 19892.61s]  Oh, fuck.
[19892.61s -> 19899.61s]  Almost like my center core in a straight line from the top of my shoulders down to my abdomen.
[19899.61s -> 19902.61s]  Front and back just hurt.
[19902.61s -> 19908.10s]  If I turn the wrong way, it's like pulling something and boom, hurting, boom, hurting, right?
[19908.10s -> 19912.41s]  Uh, six months ago, it started to get a little worse.
[19912.41s -> 19915.41s]  Like in the middle of my chest was actually starting to hurt.
[19915.41s -> 19920.58s]  I'd lean back and kind of spread my rib cage out and be like, ah.
[19920.58s -> 19923.27s]  So I've been going, I've been doing a bunch of tests.
[19923.27s -> 19927.70s]  And the weird thing about pain is what I've been told.
[19927.70s -> 19939.19s]  So many things cause pain that trying to find out what the exact thing that causes pain could take a lifetime.
[19939.19s -> 19942.20s]  So many things can cause back pain.
[19942.20s -> 19946.50s]  Almost every organ in your entire body can cause back pain.
[19946.50s -> 19954.79s]  It's just it's ruling out shit until there's nothing left to rule out.
[19954.79s -> 19963.29s]  And then you get a true diagnosis of something like a like a pain illness, something like a costochondritis or like a fibromyalgia or something.
[19963.29s -> 19964.29s]  Right.
[19964.29s -> 19967.29s]  And I'm just on that road to find out exactly what the hell's wrong with me.
[19967.29s -> 19969.36s]  Who knows?
[19969.36s -> 19972.90s]  I don't know.
[19972.90s -> 19977.79s]  That's medicine.
[19977.79s -> 19986.82s]  Is it caused from not exercising?
[19986.82s -> 19991.82s]  I contrary to maybe popular belief, maybe what people might think.
[19991.82s -> 19996.26s]  I actually I move around quite a lot.
[19996.26s -> 19998.26s]  I go for walks.
[19998.26s -> 20001.26s]  I go on errands every day.
[20001.26s -> 20003.26s]  Kim and I will go out and do things.
[20003.26s -> 20006.26s]  It's not I don't I'm not just like lying in my bed.
[20006.26s -> 20008.26s]  I don't just like stream and then go.
[20008.26s -> 20009.26s]  All right.
[20009.26s -> 20010.26s]  That was a good stream.
[20010.26s -> 20015.26s]  I just go in bed and just until tomorrow when I turn it on.
[20015.26s -> 20019.46s]  I'm fairly active when it comes to like walking around.
[20019.46s -> 20022.46s]  I walk around pretty much every day.
[20022.46s -> 20030.37s]  You don't sit in stasis until stream.
[20030.37s -> 20036.66s]  No, not really.
[20036.66s -> 20043.61s]  But to put a cap on it, my back hurts, my rib cage hurts and the middle of my chest hurts.
[20043.61s -> 20047.61s]  I was and it could be like two or three things going on at the same time.
[20047.61s -> 20051.04s]  I was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia.
[20051.04s -> 20056.04s]  That's probably what's causing the stuff in the middle of my chest that I you live with it.
[20056.04s -> 20060.04s]  You deal with it and you manage it until you eventually want to have surgery to remove it.
[20060.04s -> 20061.04s]  That's the only that's it.
[20061.04s -> 20068.06s]  The stuff with the back and the ribs might be something completely different.
[20068.06s -> 20070.06s]  So or maybe it's all the hiatal hernia.
[20070.06s -> 20071.06s]  I don't know.
[20071.06s -> 20075.90s]  It's just medical bullshit.
[20075.90s -> 20080.90s]  But it's not affecting me to a point where it's causing me any real problems.
[20080.90s -> 20081.90s]  Right.
[20081.90s -> 20082.90s]  I can still walk around.
[20082.90s -> 20083.90s]  I can still move around.
[20083.90s -> 20088.72s]  I just can't fast movements or moving too far in one direction.
[20088.72s -> 20092.72s]  Like, for instance, you guys, here's a perfect example of what I'm talking about.
[20092.72s -> 20094.72s]  Those are the drive cars.
[20094.72s -> 20104.72s]  You know, when you put the car in reverse and you turn to look out the back of your rear of your, you know, look out the back window.
[20104.72s -> 20110.72s]  You know, that movement that put my arm up, look out the barge.
[20110.72s -> 20117.57s]  That's when it really hurts.
[20117.57s -> 20119.57s]  It's movements like that in both directions.
[20119.57s -> 20124.11s]  That's what the rear view mirror is for.
[20124.11s -> 20126.11s]  I know I use my rear view mirror.
[20126.11s -> 20128.35s]  I use my windows and everything.
[20128.35s -> 20134.42s]  But that that movement people do, you know, you turn that far.
[20134.42s -> 20136.42s]  And also, I don't like I don't just trust the one mirror.
[20136.42s -> 20137.42s]  I got a look.
[20137.42s -> 20138.42s]  I got to see everything.
[20138.42s -> 20139.42s]  I got to fucking take it.
[20139.42s -> 20142.42s]  I got to look at the fucking sides and I can look at the back and then rear rear view mirror.
[20142.42s -> 20146.42s]  I got to look up and you'll miss something that rear view mirror.
[20146.42s -> 20147.42s]  You can't trust it.
[20147.42s -> 20157.30s]  You got to fucking get your whole peripheral for your head out the window.
[20157.30s -> 20170.39s]  Yeah, that was a very long winded story, but that's kind of where it's at now.
[20170.39s -> 20172.39s]  But thank you smelly boy for the 250.
[20172.39s -> 20173.39s]  Yeah, I had a lot of fun.
[20173.39s -> 20180.39s]  This is besides the obviously the times are crashed and we were, you know, dead air for about five, 10 straight minutes.
[20180.39s -> 20181.39s]  It was hilarious.
[20181.39s -> 20182.39s]  I had a lot of fun.
[20182.39s -> 20186.13s]  Bala koala.
[20186.13s -> 20187.13s]  Thanks for the 500 bits.
[20187.13s -> 20188.13s]  God is dead.
[20188.13s -> 20190.13s]  God remains dead.
[20190.13s -> 20191.13s]  We have killed him.
[20191.13s -> 20194.13s]  How shall we come fund ourselves and murderers?
[20194.13s -> 20196.30s]  This is an entire W thing.
[20196.30s -> 20197.30s]  I don't I'm not.
[20197.30s -> 20198.30s]  Shall we?
[20198.30s -> 20199.30s]  I don't want to do this.
[20200.30s -> 20205.30s]  I'm not reading this whole thing with like the we names thing with everything.
[20205.30s -> 20207.30s]  It's just R is W kill.
[20207.30s -> 20208.30s]  I killed him.
[20208.30s -> 20210.30s]  Now, that's what you get.
[20210.30s -> 20211.30s]  I'm not doing anymore.
[20211.30s -> 20214.74s]  What festival was atonement?
[20214.74s -> 20216.74s]  What sacred gangs shall we have?
[20216.74s -> 20217.74s]  No, none done.
[20217.74s -> 20218.74s]  Thanks for 500 bits.
[20218.74s -> 20219.74s]  Bala koala.
[20219.74s -> 20220.74s]  Appreciate it.
[20220.74s -> 20222.62s]  Sad Vega.
[20222.62s -> 20223.62s]  Thanks for 250.
[20223.62s -> 20224.62s]  Merry Christmas.
[20224.62s -> 20227.62s]  Here's a lot of money you asked for us for the lawyer.
[20227.62s -> 20231.48s]  Thank you.
[20231.48s -> 20233.49s]  Sad Vega.
[20233.49s -> 20234.49s]  Esparza Escalada.
[20234.49s -> 20235.49s]  Thanks for the 500 bits.
[20235.49s -> 20237.66s]  Here's some money for your legal defense.
[20237.66s -> 20240.66s]  Even if you are a liar and a thief and you killed God and destroyed heaven.
[20240.66s -> 20243.66s]  Really sorry about burning down your house.
[20243.66s -> 20246.66s]  Really though, this stream made me laugh till my stomach hurt.
[20246.66s -> 20249.93s]  These little products tend to do it.
[20249.93s -> 20253.09s]  It's all right.
[20253.09s -> 20256.42s]  I probably deserve it.
[20256.42s -> 20257.42s]  Hey, Michael smells.
[20257.42s -> 20258.42s]  Thanks for the 300 bits.
[20258.42s -> 20259.42s]  Hey, German.
[20259.42s -> 20262.42s]  Can you please say Liz, you are epic and my best friend ever.
[20262.42s -> 20263.42s]  And I thought this would be a good present.
[20263.42s -> 20266.42s]  Now that you've said their name, you have seven days.
[20266.42s -> 20267.85s]  What?
[20267.85s -> 20269.92s]  Seven days for what?
[20269.92s -> 20278.82s]  What happens after seven days?
[20278.82s -> 20280.82s]  I didn't watch any videotape.
[20280.82s -> 20286.15s]  Anime big boy.
[20286.15s -> 20287.15s]  Thanks for 300 bits.
[20287.15s -> 20289.15s]  The stream was great and I really enjoyed myself.
[20289.15s -> 20293.33s]  When is the next big anime game?
[20293.33s -> 20294.33s]  I don't know.
[20294.33s -> 20297.33s]  I don't know if there's ever been a first.
[20297.33s -> 20298.33s]  Thank you though.
[20298.33s -> 20299.33s]  Appreciate it.
[20299.33s -> 20303.00s]  Let's switch over.
[20303.00s -> 20306.56s]  Let's switch gears to the theater.
[20306.56s -> 20308.74s]  Throw in the credits.
[20308.74s -> 20310.87s]  Thanks again for watching, everybody.
[20310.87s -> 20312.87s]  We'll see you tomorrow for a mystery stream.
[20312.87s -> 20313.87s]  It could be the Surge 2.
[20313.87s -> 20315.87s]  Could be Dead Rising 3.
[20315.87s -> 20322.87s]  Could be Nancy Drew, Sea of Thieves.
[20322.87s -> 20324.30s]  Whatever it was.
[20324.30s -> 20325.30s]  Could be anything.
[20325.30s -> 20326.30s]  It's a mystery stream.
[20326.30s -> 20331.59s]  It could be Jump King DLC.
[20331.59s -> 20334.02s]  It's not going to be Jump King DLC.
[20334.02s -> 20339.40s]  Could be Red Alert 2.
[20339.40s -> 20340.58s]  I don't know.
[20340.58s -> 20341.75s]  It could be anything.
[20341.75s -> 20343.75s]  It could be Sea of Thieves.
[20343.75s -> 20349.22s]  Could it be Salmon Max?
[20349.22s -> 20350.22s]  No.
[20350.22s -> 20351.65s]  I told you already.
[20351.65s -> 20352.65s]  I know.
[20352.65s -> 20353.65s]  I'm sorry.
[20353.65s -> 20354.65s]  Season 3 just didn't do it for me.
[20354.65s -> 20355.65s]  I'm sorry.
[20355.65s -> 20356.65s]  I really liked the first two seasons.
[20356.65s -> 20357.65s]  They were very good.
[20357.65s -> 20358.65s]  I just didn't lie about Salmon Max.
[20358.65s -> 20359.65s]  I already covered those bases.
[20359.65s -> 20360.65s]  My money.
[20360.65s -> 20361.65s]  What do you guys think I'm going to do?
[20361.65s -> 20362.65s]  Disco Alcium?
[20362.65s -> 20363.65s]  Hmm.
[20363.65s -> 20364.65s]  Yeah, that could be.
[20364.65s -> 20366.08s]  But that's a long game.
[20366.08s -> 20367.08s]  Hey, very nice.
[20367.08s -> 20368.32s]  Thanks for Thousand Bits.
[20368.32s -> 20369.32s]  I visited a Buddhist temple in southern Japan last year to clear my head and gain spiritual
[20369.32s -> 20370.32s]  enlightenment.
[20370.32s -> 20371.32s]  Unfortunately, it was closed due to being the wrong season.
[20371.32s -> 20372.32s]  And I had to obey the rules.
[20372.32s -> 20374.20s]  I'm sorry.
[20374.20s -> 20375.20s]  Hey, very nice.
[20375.20s -> 20376.20s]  Thanks for Thousand Bits.
[20376.20s -> 20380.20s]  I visited a Buddhist temple in southern Japan last year to clear my head and gain spiritual
[20380.20s -> 20381.20s]  enlightenment.
[20381.20s -> 20384.44s]  Unfortunately, it was closed due to being the wrong season.
[20384.44s -> 20387.44s]  And I had to walk back down the mountain.
[20387.44s -> 20394.39s]  If you had a round-trip ticket to anywhere in the world, where would you go and why?
[20394.39s -> 20396.39s]  Is that real?
[20396.39s -> 20399.14s]  That sucks, man.
[20399.14s -> 20406.48s]  If I could go anywhere round-trip, why?
[20406.48s -> 20409.48s]  Okay, I want to go to Antarctica.
[20409.48s -> 20415.97s]  Do I get an infinite amount of money?
[20415.97s -> 20422.97s]  I want to be in one of those big three jackets where I'm just waddling like a toddler around,
[20422.97s -> 20427.53s]  looking at ice crystals and penguins and stuff.
[20427.53s -> 20434.82s]  I need to have like 10 people that I hire that come with me to make sure I stay alive.
[20434.82s -> 20435.82s]  Does that include money?
[20435.82s -> 20437.82s]  I have infinite money, right?
[20437.82s -> 20443.64s]  Yeah, I need 10 people for that.
[20443.64s -> 20450.76s]  I want to have the cold, chilly, white booger crystal face.
[20450.76s -> 20456.76s]  Well, I'm just like, I want to do it.
[20456.76s -> 20460.58s]  And go look at the ice and the glaciers.
[20460.58s -> 20465.78s]  I mean, the second answer is I'd go to Japan and go to Tokyo.
[20465.78s -> 20467.78s]  I want to do that.
[20467.78s -> 20468.78s]  That's number two.
[20468.78s -> 20472.27s]  You said anywhere and do anything in the world.
[20478.76s -> 20482.76s]  Okay, just because you want to go to Tokyo,
[20482.76s -> 20486.76s]  that has nothing to do with how much I enjoy anime.
[20486.76s -> 20488.76s]  It's an interesting place on Earth.
[20488.76s -> 20494.45s]  You know, guys, I think I really want to go to Japan because of how much I love anime.
[20494.45s -> 20496.71s]  What?
[20496.71s -> 20502.66s]  It's one of the most culturally dense places on Earth.
[20502.66s -> 20504.66s]  I like the anime.
[20504.66s -> 20507.56s]  I want to go.
[20507.56s -> 20516.88s]  I want to go and see everything and take in everything.
[20516.88s -> 20520.30s]  Yeah.
[20520.30s -> 20521.30s]  But yeah, there you go.
[20521.30s -> 20523.30s]  I want to go to Antarctica.
[20523.30s -> 20525.98s]  And I want to get infinite money.
[20525.98s -> 20530.98s]  I want like a $60,000 camera with a lens that's as big as a telescope.
[20530.98s -> 20532.98s]  And I want to even if I don't know what I'm doing, who cares?
[20532.98s -> 20533.98s]  There's 10 people.
[20533.98s -> 20535.98s]  There's 10 people that have to fucking deal with me.
[20535.98s -> 20537.98s]  One of them is going to be a professional photographer.
[20537.98s -> 20545.61s]  So I can just pretend like I'm a really good photographer and like typically pictures of polar bears and stuff like I'm going to have the guy set up the shot.
[20545.61s -> 20547.61s]  And then I go move, please.
[20547.61s -> 20555.09s]  And I go down and I looked in and I do a little bit of focusing, do rack focus, change the f-stop, click.
[20555.09s -> 20564.99s]  And it's my photo.
[20564.99s -> 20566.99s]  There are no polar bears in Antarctica.
[20566.99s -> 20571.98s]  Well, whatever.
[20571.98s -> 20578.32s]  I'll take a picture of a seal or a penguin.
[20578.32s -> 20581.32s]  Hey, Jude, Minecraft, thanks for 300 bits.
[20581.32s -> 20582.32s]  Thank you for your wonderful streams.
[20582.32s -> 20583.32s]  You always help me through rough times.
[20583.32s -> 20584.32s]  Love you streams.
[20584.32s -> 20585.32s]  Hope your holidays are nice.
[20585.32s -> 20587.32s]  Hope your holidays are good as well.
[20587.32s -> 20591.90s]  Thank you for the 300 bits and this nice statement.
[20591.90s -> 20592.90s]  Thank you.
[20592.90s -> 20598.13s]  And then we had a drummage door for the 250.
[20598.13s -> 20602.13s]  I have a J-cup, a J-cup.
[20602.13s -> 20604.26s]  Okay.
[20604.26s -> 20606.26s]  This is like an image I'm not putting on stream.
[20606.26s -> 20612.26s]  This is just actually I'm not clicking that and I don't don't click that one.
[20612.26s -> 20613.26s]  I don't know.
[20613.26s -> 20614.26s]  I thought that was a Jupiter.
[20614.26s -> 20616.26s]  I thought you were talking about you have like a juke.
[20616.26s -> 20617.26s]  Thank you for the 250.
[20617.26s -> 20618.26s]  Appreciate it.
[20618.26s -> 20622.26s]  Snoozingcopter, finally just the mandatory bit message so I'm still allowed to watch the streams.
[20622.26s -> 20623.26s]  Good night, Jermis.
[20623.26s -> 20624.26s]  See you tomorrow.
[20624.26s -> 20625.26s]  To the fence painting stream.
[20625.26s -> 20626.26s]  Looking forward to it.
[20626.26s -> 20627.26s]  Could be anything.
[20627.26s -> 20628.26s]  It's a mystery stream.
[20628.26s -> 20629.26s]  It could be anything.
[20629.26s -> 20640.55s]  It could be anything.
[20640.55s -> 20649.73s]  Why does it sound like Dr. Evil music?
[20649.73s -> 20652.31s]  All right.
[20652.31s -> 20653.31s]  See you guys tomorrow.
[20653.31s -> 20660.31s]  Giant enemy bond.
[20660.31s -> 20665.09s]  I'm going to go watch Austin Powers.
[20665.09s -> 20666.09s]  You should.
[20666.09s -> 20667.33s]  They're great movies.
[20667.33s -> 20677.10s]  Actually, the movies, those movies are hilarious.
[20677.10s -> 20685.07s]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[20685.07s -> 20686.31s]  See you tomorrow.
[20686.31s -> 20687.31s]  Good night.
[20687.31s -> 20727.27s]  See you tomorrow.
[20727.27s -> 20727.77s]  Good night.
