[3.45s -> 12.36s]  What is up guys, it's Germa here with another gameplay commentary.
[12.36s -> 19.36s]  This time we are playing as the Demo Knight, the Persian Persuader Demo Knight with the splendid screen and the Wii booties.
[19.36s -> 26.54s]  I know I said a long time ago I was gonna do a proper Demo Knight gameplay, and it just never happened.
[26.54s -> 33.54s]  So here it is, a proper Demo Knight gameplay. Using the Uber Update stuff like I said, this is on King of the Hill Nucleus.
[33.54s -> 39.54s]  Minicentury, get out of town. And now let us talk about a legitimate strategy when using the Demo Knight.
[39.54s -> 43.84s]  Did you see what I just did there? I was on fire, there were a lot of people around.
[43.84s -> 50.84s]  So I turned around like, oh my god, I'm gonna run away. And then I whipped around, charged, and smashed somebody in the face.
[50.84s -> 54.84s]  That is a legitimate great strategy to use if you're gonna play Demo Knight.
[54.84s -> 59.84s]  Make people think that you're vulnerable, like, oh I gotta get out of here, and then just whip around and charge them.
[59.84s -> 63.84s]  It freaks people out all the time. Nice kill on that scalp, by the way.
[63.84s -> 70.84s]  It's a great strategy to use, I hope you guys utilize that. You'll see me do it a couple times where I back off, like as if I need to run away.
[70.84s -> 76.84s]  And that gives people a false sense of security, and they go, oh, I can take my time with this guy, he must have some low health.
[76.84s -> 82.84s]  I'm gonna pull my secondary out, maybe I'll try and juke him a little bit, and they don't expect you just to come right back at them.
[82.84s -> 87.84s]  It's a great idea, please use it, you will get much more kills, especially stringing kills together.
[87.84s -> 93.84s]  I see a lot of Demo Knights just ram into somebody and then just get blown up five times in a row.
[93.84s -> 101.84s]  Like one for one, one for one. To get out of that one for one kills as a Demo Knight, you need to utilize some trickery.
[101.84s -> 106.84s]  You need to really mess with people because you don't have any other option. You have no other way to hurt anyone.
[106.84s -> 113.84s]  So if you're just gonna charge in and hit somebody and just start swinging like a freak show, you're gonna kill one person and then you're just gonna die.
[113.84s -> 121.99s]  Kind of, it's kind of weird for me to say this, but play the Demo Knight the way you would play a spy.
[121.99s -> 128.17s]  What I mean by that is utilize the same mindset that you play when you play spy.
[128.17s -> 135.17s]  The trickery, sneaking around, hiding, using things other than weapons to get kills.
[135.17s -> 141.73s]  So obviously you're gonna have to kill somebody with the sword, but getting to that point is what I'm talking about.
[141.73s -> 145.73s]  Getting to that point where you have to kill somebody is what I'm talking about.
[145.73s -> 150.10s]  And if you've noticed, I've stayed kind of in the same area for the most part of this gameplay.
[150.10s -> 158.10s]  Up near the right side of the blue team spawn, this kind of stairway over here, this is a great spot to hang out and be the Demo Spy.
[158.10s -> 163.10s]  It's awesome because they don't expect, when people come up here, people think they're gonna go around.
[163.10s -> 166.10s]  Maybe they'll encounter a scout. That's what goes through people's mindsets.
[166.10s -> 172.10s]  But people don't expect to see somebody at the top of these stairs because it's blocked out by a lot of things.
[172.10s -> 178.10s]  That right staircase, on our side as well, is blocked by the ceiling, the walls.
[178.10s -> 181.10s]  You can't really see anything when you come up there.
[181.10s -> 185.34s]  So I charged at this soldier who came up the stairs, didn't really think I was gonna be there.
[185.34s -> 188.34s]  I believe that was Chicken Fingers, and this is on Shibbi's server.
[188.34s -> 192.34s]  If you don't play on Shibbi's server, then you are missing out because it's a great time.
[193.34s -> 200.34s]  I completely missed that charge. I have the Wii booties on, but it's not enough of a turn radius to be able to turn and hit somebody, if you don't know.
[200.34s -> 206.77s]  The Wii booties give you the ability to turn while you're charging, which can help in some situations.
[206.77s -> 210.77s]  But for the most part, I put the Wii booties on for the extra health.
[210.77s -> 216.94s]  Now, it's also good, the Wii booties can be very, very good if you're going to use them with the regular Islander.
[216.94s -> 222.12s]  The Islander, if you don't know, makes your health go down by, I believe, I think it's 15 or 25.
[222.12s -> 224.12s]  I don't remember, but it's one of those two.
[224.12s -> 229.49s]  And when you put the Wii booties on, you completely negate that downside of the Islander.
[229.49s -> 233.49s]  So the Islander just turns into a 100% upgrade.
[233.49s -> 238.73s]  And I think I'm going to utilize that more often because I'm kind of sick of using this setup as the demo night.
[238.73s -> 244.73s]  Because ever since the Uber update came out, every single demo man is using this for the demo night.
[244.73s -> 250.73s]  And it's kind of sad because, I mean, the Persian Persuader is so good.
[250.73s -> 253.73s]  It is probably the best melee item in the game.
[253.73s -> 258.73s]  Of course, excluding things like the Gunslinger and the Spy Knife and stuff like that.
[258.73s -> 264.90s]  But for a side melee weapon for the other classes, this definitely takes the cake.
[264.90s -> 267.08s]  So let's get back into the gameplay now.
[267.08s -> 270.08s]  I get hit by something from behind, so I'm going to go up these stairs.
[270.08s -> 272.08s]  No, I'm not. Smash kill this guy.
[272.08s -> 274.08s]  I think that's Chicken Fingers again.
[274.08s -> 276.08s]  Sorry, Chicken, I got you.
[277.08s -> 282.32s]  Get the assist on that demo man and then smash myself right into a grenade.
[282.32s -> 286.32s]  But again, that's what you want to do as a demo man using the demo night setup.
[286.32s -> 292.32s]  You want to make people think that you're running away or make people think you're vulnerable and then smash them, baby.
[292.32s -> 296.50s]  So we have one second left and now there's overtime.
[296.50s -> 298.50s]  And we end up actually winning this. It is a great...
[298.50s -> 302.50s]  Look at this, just chaos on the point. I love chaos on the point.
[302.50s -> 303.50s]  It's a whole lot of fun.
[303.50s -> 307.50s]  Get a bunch of assists, get a bunch of kills in that little short period.
[307.50s -> 310.93s]  And now we are the winners of the game.
[310.93s -> 312.93s]  That is not the end, guys.
[312.93s -> 317.30s]  I know some of you might have thought that was the end, but it is not the end.
[317.30s -> 324.30s]  I have a couple of small bonus clips of me just destroying people as the Heavy,
[324.30s -> 329.30s]  using the killing gloves of boxing and the Buffalo Steak Sandwich,
[329.30s -> 333.30s]  getting the crit so you can crit, crit, crit over and over and over again.
[333.30s -> 340.78s]  And it was pretty funny. I played like this for an entire game for at least probably maybe 20 to 30 minutes.
[340.78s -> 342.78s]  This is all I was doing.
[342.78s -> 344.78s]  So I hope you enjoyed these bonus clips.
[344.78s -> 347.78s]  I'm not going to really commentate on them because it's pretty self-explanatory.
[347.78s -> 349.78s]  You'll get to see what I do.
[349.78s -> 352.78s]  You're actually seeing it right now, so I hope you're laughing.
[352.78s -> 356.78s]  Just absolutely crushing people, getting in front of a spawn room door and stuff like that.
[356.78s -> 360.78s]  Just one, two, three, four.
[360.78s -> 363.78s]  Let me just say this before this ends, before these little bonus clips are over.
[363.78s -> 367.78s]  Guys, this is actually a pretty legitimate setup.
[367.78s -> 374.32s]  If you can kill one person with these gloves, you will just go on a tirade.
[374.32s -> 377.32s]  As you can see, I'm not an expert at melee.
[377.32s -> 381.32s]  I just go on a complete and total catastrophe with these things.
[381.32s -> 384.32s]  And you can kill like four, maybe five people in a row.
[384.32s -> 388.32s]  You can kill like five people in one second.
[388.32s -> 392.32s]  Just by going one, two, three, four, and get a line of people.
[392.32s -> 394.94s]  It's like a chain stab.
[394.94s -> 397.94s]  But anyways, guys, I want to say thank you so much for watching.
[397.94s -> 398.94s]  You guys are awesome.
[398.94s -> 404.94s]  I hope you enjoyed this little goofy couple of gameplays of Demo Night and Heavy Freak Show.
[404.94s -> 405.94s]  So thank you all for watching.
[405.94s -> 410.21s]  Take care, everybody, and I hope to see you all next time.
