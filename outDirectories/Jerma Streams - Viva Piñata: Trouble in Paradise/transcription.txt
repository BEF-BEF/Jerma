[0.50s -> 9.29s]  Hi. So I'm realizing the tweet that I just put out, uh, sounds kind of weird.
[9.29s -> 16.46s]  Relaxing for a bit with some stuffed animals. Like, am I just lying on my bed,
[16.46s -> 20.36s]  camera pointed at me, with like all of my stuffed animal friends?
[24.47s -> 28.14s]  Anyways, hi guys. Welcome back.
[31.42s -> 41.88s]  Kinda. Welcome back. Kinda. I am not moved. I mean, I'm in the process.
[42.68s -> 47.85s]  Uh, I actually haven't really had a moment to sit down until right now.
[48.57s -> 59.61s]  It was like the first time I've sat down, unless I was in bed sleeping in about six days, five days.
[60.49s -> 62.81s]  You can, hey, you can hear the rumor. That's how you know.
[63.45s -> 70.54s]  But I just sat in this room. It was all bullshit. I'm just, you know, I'm not going anywhere.
[73.05s -> 81.88s]  He lied about canceling streaming. Wait, what? I 100% guaranteed there'd be a stream today.
[82.52s -> 86.12s]  It was one. I mean, you cannot go back on a 100% guarantee.
[86.76s -> 91.00s]  Hey, you get yourself in some trouble. What do you mean you banned that guy?
[92.09s -> 96.01s]  Oh, right. I was supposed to ban somebody. That's right. I'm sorry. I've been all over the place.
[96.01s -> 101.21s]  Uh, these last five days, someone's going to get banned. They said, ban me if you do, right?
[101.21s -> 107.08s]  You remember their name? Yeah. They were like, there's no way you're streaming on Saturday.
[107.08s -> 112.84s]  I fucking guarantee it. Otherwise ban me, dickhead or something, right? So ban that person, I guess.
[113.40s -> 116.92s]  Uh, turtle toenail just gave 5,000 bits. We haven't even started.
[118.68s -> 121.48s]  I wouldn't give me any money before I tell you what the plan is. You know what I'm saying?
[121.48s -> 126.38s]  Like, let me just be really honest with you. Uh, okay. Let me give you the plan first before
[126.38s -> 129.98s]  anybody's like, he's back. All right, let's there. There we go. He's back.
[130.22s -> 135.78s]  Let's talk about, let's go over the plan first. Uh, anyways, thanks for the huge money though.
[135.78s -> 145.96s]  Seriously. That's 5,000 bits. Appreciate it. I'm turtle toenail. They say, hey, you, you, do you,
[145.96s -> 155.34s]  hey, do you got a Mitch Hedberg? Oh, do I have a Mitch Hedberg impression? Oh, I was like, what?
[155.34s -> 159.82s]  Uh, it's kind of, Mitch Hedberg is kind of hard to do. He's fucking legendary comedian.
[159.82s -> 169.64s]  Um, Mitch Hedberg is kind of like this. He talks about, why the Pringles? No, I can't do it.
[169.64s -> 174.76s]  I got it. Maybe a little bit. Uh, the answer is no. Uh, he's a legendary fucking comedian.
[174.76s -> 178.12s]  Some of the funniest shit ever. I can't. I'll do an impression of Mitch Hedberg. I tried.
[183.72s -> 187.48s]  Look, if somebody's all right, I'm seeing a lot of minus twos. If somebody's going to give me
[187.48s -> 194.22s]  $50 to attempt an impression, what am I going to say? No. All right. Thanks for the $50. Uh,
[194.22s -> 202.68s]  you know, I don't think I feel like saying one sentence for $50. Come on, man. Come on, Gwen.
[202.68s -> 213.19s]  I can, I can, I see some, come on, wins here, please. You know what I mean? Why is nobody
[213.19s -> 217.35s]  doing it? Oh fuck. I forgot pre-stream chat is not every single person that watches this channel.
[217.35s -> 229.96s]  Sorry. I, I seriously like forget that. Anyways, uh, so here's the deal. Here's the deal. Uh,
[230.52s -> 234.58s]  there's been a lot of, it's been slow going. Let's just put it that way.
[236.39s -> 240.47s]  And it's going to take a lot longer than initially anticipated to actually move.
[241.77s -> 246.97s]  So because of all the coronavirus stuff and social distancing and all that shit, we're trying to do
[246.97s -> 251.21s]  this right. And we're trying to do it in a way that we're all comfortable and everything. So
[252.70s -> 261.99s]  we're not really ready yet, but we are, but we aren't. So, uh, streams for the next few days,
[261.99s -> 267.51s]  I'm going to be streaming, but they're only going to be three to four hours each for the next few
[267.51s -> 272.98s]  days. This is temporary until all this is kind of get where we need to be. You know what I mean?
[274.63s -> 280.57s]  So that's the way it is. So hold off on your, on your, on your $50 donations.
[281.59s -> 285.27s]  Fuck somebody already did it right. So we're going to do, we're going to relax. I haven't really had
[285.27s -> 289.19s]  a time to relax. I've been, I have, like I said, I haven't stopped moving. So we're going to play
[289.19s -> 293.75s]  Viva Piñata, uh, trouble in paradise is the one that everyone wanted me to play. Here comes the
[293.75s -> 309.29s]  hype train. Why don't you just try moving harder? It won't be that easy. But, uh, anyways, let's get
[309.29s -> 313.21s]  going. We're going to play Viva Piñata, trouble in paradise. Jerma sucks gave 10 community subs.
[313.21s -> 320.26s]  This guy sucks. Well, not you, me. Cause that's what you're referring to. So short streams over
[320.26s -> 327.78s]  the next few days. Um, we'll get back to normal here soon. I promise, but not immediately. Not
[327.78s -> 335.72s]  immediately. Here it is. So this is the good one, right? This is the one that everybody wanted me
[335.72s -> 350.30s]  to play. This is, this is the good one. You don't have an active gamer profile. Yeah, I do. What
[350.38s -> 379.61s]  are you talking about? No, I don't care about Xbox live. When you change a gamer profile,
[379.61s -> 384.33s]  you be returned to the title screen. Enjoy your time with Viva Piñata. Trouble in paradise.
[384.97s -> 391.86s]  Like your message. I'm not going to fucking do that. I don't care. Cause I haven't like paid
[391.86s -> 405.10s]  for Xbox live in probably like nine months or something. I already did this. Oh no. I'm saying
[405.10s -> 411.82s]  I don't, I don't have it. I don't own Xbox live right now. I, I consolidated all my subscription
[411.82s -> 416.71s]  services. What does it give me a warning for? The auto save. Yeah. There's a big donut in the
[416.71s -> 426.04s]  middle. Another 5,000 bits just came in. Uh, you missed my pre-stream bits, but they're irrelevant
[426.04s -> 437.21s]  now due to the poll being closed. Thanks for the 5,000 fucking bits dude. Seriously. If you were,
[437.21s -> 442.33s]  I was here like three hours ago, just checking in. I'm not even going to say this because the
[442.33s -> 448.49s]  votes are over and I'm not going to cause a fight in chat. Long story short, Nancy Drew was on that
[448.49s -> 458.76s]  list and it had 6% of the whole vote and a lot of people were angry. How many times do I have to
[458.76s -> 480.36s]  pick? Do I really care about this? Yes. I'm aware that that is a name of somebody that I've
[480.36s -> 490.23s]  potentially made up in the chat. Okay. I don't just, what the fuck do I care? Chat will never
[490.23s -> 498.81s]  forget. This is my, no, I'm changing it, but what if I, just be careful. What if like who's David?
[498.81s -> 506.20s]  I don't fucking know. I probably made that name when I was drunk or this is a used Xbox 360 console.
[506.20s -> 510.79s]  That could be like some other person's account or something. I don't know. I don't remember.
[510.79s -> 523.06s]  I don't remember. I don't know. Stolen. No, it's not. I made it or something. I don't know. I can't.
[523.06s -> 531.58s]  I have no idea. I cannot tell you the real reason why it's just there. All right. How do I, hold on.
[531.58s -> 541.19s]  What should I name this? This is a stolen Xbox. I didn't fucking steal this Xbox.
[541.99s -> 549.54s]  It didn't steal it. I purchased it. God damn it. I purchased it. I purchased it.
[550.26s -> 557.21s]  Prove it. People, you want me to show you the receipt from when I bought this Xbox 360.
[558.89s -> 567.29s]  Guys, that receipt went into the trash. What do you want me to say? Do you think I held on to the
[567.29s -> 578.70s]  Xbox 360 refurbished receipt? This thing was like $44. No, I think this thing was like $38.
[579.74s -> 596.92s]  That's irresponsible. For tax purposes. I don't know. You want to write off the 360?
[597.98s -> 601.74s]  All right. Fine. I'll go get the receipt and I'll write off the 360 for you. Okay.
[604.41s -> 613.10s]  Look, I've got a CPA that takes care of this for me. Jeremy, did you itemize that fucking 360?
[613.10s -> 617.11s]  No, I don't care. Want me to throw it in the trash? I'll just open the trash. I've not dropped
[617.11s -> 622.66s]  the fucking thing into the trash. No, I wouldn't do that. I would fucking donate it. Stop. Anyways,
[622.66s -> 626.42s]  what's the name of the garden? What's the name of the garden? Anybody got a name for the garden?
[631.56s -> 650.81s]  David's garden. David's garden. Well, I don't, I don't. I've missed you guys. It's been like five
[650.81s -> 659.32s]  days. I've missed you guys. David, wait, where's the, where's the little symbol that shows possession?
[670.22s -> 677.98s]  Okay, there we go. Put it on the hard drive. Oh, finally we can get past the fucking main menu.
[677.98s -> 682.62s]  Great gardeners can make their piñatas candy-o-city meter full and piñatas at full
[682.62s -> 687.26s]  candy-o-city are much more valuable. So this, you say this one's much better than the last one.
[687.26s -> 703.37s]  Why? Why is this one better than the last one? Extra, extra sweet? It's the same fucking game.
[703.37s -> 712.55s]  Oh. I just love fireworks. Oh, get away. This is my moment.
[724.94s -> 728.14s]  Okay. It's been like five days since I said that.
[735.75s -> 739.35s]  No such thing as a simple hacking technique. It's all incredibly detailed code and shit.
[739.35s -> 743.27s]  I hate when people fucking say that, by the way. As a fucking coder myself,
[743.27s -> 754.20s]  that's so fucking irritating.
[765.90s -> 774.26s]  Is this a bit? Hold on. You can't tell if me saying that I'm a coder is real or not.
[777.54s -> 781.22s]  There's absolutely no way I know that's accurate.
[783.22s -> 791.35s]  Um, no, I don't know anything about code. In fact, I tried a long time ago and it was a
[791.35s -> 796.15s]  disaster. Seriously fucking impossible. It's like one of the most detailed,
[796.15s -> 808.18s]  most difficult skills in the world. Okay. Let's open up the menu. This is the garden. Oh,
[808.18s -> 813.94s]  it's just like the last one. We're gonna, here comes the same stream we did with different animals.
[814.90s -> 822.97s]  This is gonna be, we're gonna get introduced to all the weird bugs and
[824.97s -> 827.13s]  foxes. It's a rerun.
[831.45s -> 834.49s]  Hey, at least the garden is done. I don't have to like do any bullshit.
[835.29s -> 847.50s]  Oh, you can take pictures in this one. Oh, wait, we already get a frog too? Holy shit.
[848.46s -> 856.15s]  Wow. Okay. What do you want me to do? Make a flower?
[856.15s -> 862.33s]  Okay, so if we read this, this is a bispati.
[900.02s -> 903.70s]  and lacquerate spots, and those eyelashes just don't naturally curl like that, you know.
[921.05s -> 924.71s]  Okay, must be a maximum candy-osity.
[933.00s -> 936.87s]  Okay, you can get your pinatas ready for their trip in a
[937.51s -> 942.39s]  cano, can, canonata by feeding them. This is a lot, this is not the same game.
[948.44s -> 950.84s]  Nobody said, feel good ink laugh.
[956.18s -> 965.86s]  Find the many ways that you can increase a pinata's candy-osity meter and then send it off to a party.
[965.86s -> 972.01s]  All right, how do we fill the candy, what, you have to like dress it up in clogs?
[972.65s -> 980.15s]  All right, we, we need a flower. That's what he wants, right?
[983.35s -> 986.79s]  Somebody make that? Yeah, I'm sure somebody will. Don't worry, give them like five minutes.
[987.51s -> 996.71s]  It's like the bug with your cursor. Information button. All right, we need a flower, right?
[997.27s -> 1002.17s]  Have three poppies in the garden and that will bring a bispati in.
[1012.30s -> 1015.18s]  Move the cursor into the garden and open up the menu and put a flower.
[1016.30s -> 1019.26s]  All right, so where should I put these? I know people are gonna scream at me.
[1019.26s -> 1020.70s]  I'm gonna get screamed at for doing this wrong.
[1026.76s -> 1029.32s]  You have some lovely poppies. Somebody already made it.
[1029.32s -> 1032.60s]  If you put the cursor on a bispati and press Y, you can find out what it means to stay in your garden.
[1032.60s -> 1037.56s]  How the fuck have you already done this? You need at least like five minutes to upload
[1037.56s -> 1045.86s]  the video to YouTube. It's impossible. Are we doing animal crossing tonight? No, we are not
[1045.86s -> 1052.02s]  because during the process of the move and packing and getting bought, Kim has been playing animal
[1052.02s -> 1058.26s]  crossing each night because it's one thing that we can like do. So that is currently in the
[1058.26s -> 1066.98s]  occupation of Kim. They cannot play animal crossing. It's been commandeered. Oh, we have
[1066.98s -> 1070.42s]  lovely flowers. If you put the cursor on the bispati and press Y, you can find out what it needs.
[1070.42s -> 1083.42s]  So we need three of them, right? Oh, he's here. Okay, cool. So it wants three of these. Oops.
[1083.42s -> 1093.58s]  What did I just do? Wait, can I plant this? Wait, there are already three in here, aren't there?
[1093.58s -> 1101.72s]  There's one, two, only two. Do I have to buy this shit or can I plant this? Kim stream. Kim stream.
[1102.68s -> 1112.33s]  She's not here. This dude is a simp. What? Hold on. Let me get this straight. So because
[1113.93s -> 1121.03s]  my girlfriend is currently occupying the Nintendo Switch during the potential downtime of a move,
[1122.70s -> 1134.15s]  that makes me a simp. Is that what we're understanding here? I don't know what that
[1134.15s -> 1146.30s]  word really means. Simp meme is already dead. Give it a rest. All right. Yeah. Give it a rest.
[1146.30s -> 1149.90s]  That's a dead meme according to that one guy. That's a one guy moment. All right. So how do
[1149.90s -> 1167.53s]  let's wait. What? Oh, fuck. There's another one. I remember these guys. Well done. You attracted
[1167.53s -> 1175.91s]  a world. Good soil. Oh shit. Here they come again. This is part two snakes and worms and bugs.
[1178.70s -> 1190.44s]  Okay. Some grass. All right. What do you need? You need
[1192.66s -> 1195.62s]  three poppies in the garden. All right. And I got to buy a poppy.
[1199.85s -> 1205.88s]  Shovel. So would you just dig a hole? Does it matter where? Hey, hey, hey, get away from there.
[1205.88s -> 1214.31s]  Get away from that. Don't eat that. I'll just. Can I put it on? How close can they be?
[1215.03s -> 1227.18s]  Just dig it. Just do it wherever. Let's do it right here. Okay. I'm going to put a poppy, right?
[1228.06s -> 1237.74s]  Oh, that's a poppy right there. Don't ignore the story. There is no story. It's invite a bunch of
[1237.74s -> 1246.98s]  fucking stuffed animals over your house for a few hours. That's the game. Menu. Now I can get the
[1246.98s -> 1259.80s]  watering can. You're missing the lore. You make up your own lore when it comes to stuffed animals.
[1259.80s -> 1265.00s]  As I used to sit in my bedroom with a dozen stuffed animals and make up TV shows with them.
[1265.00s -> 1268.20s]  That was my lore with them. I can do whatever I can say, whatever I want with these guys.
[1273.05s -> 1277.13s]  All right. That's good. So now it's going to grow and that will that guy will stay. So I have good
[1277.13s -> 1281.34s]  grass, right? What do you, what does this say? What do you need? How do you, how do I get you to be a
[1281.34s -> 1288.87s]  resident? Let's see. Okay. You have two square, uh, penometers of grass has eaten a mouse mallow.
[1288.87s -> 1296.92s]  All right. I need a mouse mallow. He wasn't a kid. That was last week. I mean, that's kind of accurate
[1296.92s -> 1301.45s]  if you think about it. All right. Get that poppy to grow. What are you? Are you, are you a resident
[1301.45s -> 1314.22s]  here? Romance has eaten one green flutterscotch. Okay. Wait for the bug to reside. But how long
[1314.22s -> 1326.06s]  does the flower take? These things remind me of a toad. This is a fucking toad. I don't want these
[1326.06s -> 1337.85s]  things. Let them out. Well, I don't know. I'm not letting the frog out. This is my only friend.
[1339.90s -> 1347.61s]  I only have one friend and it's this toad. Max candy-osity hint. Okay.
[1360.71s -> 1370.49s]  Okay. This is a new thing. This is different. Candy-osity award for being a resident. What do
[1370.49s -> 1374.57s]  you get? Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. All right. Let's figure, let's figure out how to raise our
[1374.57s -> 1385.67s]  candy-osity meter. New resident, new resident. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, look, it's kind of cool looking.
[1385.67s -> 1397.13s]  Okay. So and rename this potty. What should we rename this? Toad. I mean, I did just say it. So
[1397.13s -> 1417.43s]  why don't we just do it? It's 7 40 a.m. I don't know. Do you think I ever set the date and time
[1417.43s -> 1428.46s]  on this Xbox? Never. Wherever David lived is where this is probably set to. All right. This is the
[1428.46s -> 1444.97s]  house, right? Cognata at full candy-osity. Okay. So now it's like you pack item. Wait, I'm packing
[1444.97s -> 1458.23s]  this? What am I doing? I just disintegrated them. Wait, where are you going? Am I harvesting this guy?
[1462.82s -> 1467.14s]  Congratulations. You've completed the first challenge by successful. All right. So we,
[1468.26s -> 1476.20s]  we gonzo the graded into where? That wasn't too hard, was it? Now let's try something a bit more
[1476.20s -> 1486.78s]  tricky. Oh, you. So is that the point of trouble in paradise? As you make them really happy and
[1486.78s -> 1500.47s]  then you fire them out of a cannon to a party. You sent them to the glue factory. Oh my god.
[1501.67s -> 1512.23s]  You fucking psycho. All right. Anyways, candy. So we have to make them really happy and then send
[1512.23s -> 1525.13s]  them to the, to the party, to the party in quotes. God damn it. Oh, why did you have to say that?
[1525.13s -> 1533.69s]  Langston. Okay. Bring them back alive. I've got a request from someone having a beach party.
[1533.69s -> 1539.70s]  They want a sandy pinata. So I suggest you go to the desert area and trap a sweetle.
[1539.70s -> 1547.96s]  Follow the cursor and we'll soon have this one done. Ooh. Jeremy's garden. When you're here,
[1547.96s -> 1559.53s]  you're family. Okay. So we've got to get a, a sweetle. Oh, sorry. I just read that. That was,
[1559.53s -> 1563.85s]  that was not even my joke. Uh, that was a bit joke. I just read it. I just stole it. I'm going
[1563.85s -> 1566.89s]  to make sure I give credit. That was potion dwellers said that that was a stolen joke and
[1566.89s -> 1574.04s]  I want to make sure I give credit for it. Oh, and now everyone changes to plus two. That's really
[1574.04s -> 1583.90s]  funny. That's very, very interesting, by the way. When the sun goes down, look for a suitable
[1583.90s -> 1593.34s]  garden moth drop more. Oh, it's a pretz tail. I had a couple of these before they're hard to
[1593.34s -> 1606.50s]  manage though. They eat everybody. It's on his ear. The tag has appeared. They like to investigate
[1606.50s -> 1611.85s]  a garden in the dark. Okay. Here comes another one. All right. Select the desert. You can go to
[1611.85s -> 1618.68s]  multiple parks. All right. Where are we going? Is it the desert? The desert dessert, the dessert
[1618.68s -> 1624.63s]  desert. What? I don't know why it is red. Do you want to follow the shitpost to the desert?
[1625.67s -> 1640.12s]  Sure. I would not follow a shitpost map. You'd end up, you'd have been like fucking another country.
[1640.12s -> 1664.54s]  Oh, there it is. A sweetle, right? First sighting of a sweetle. How do I get them?
[1664.54s -> 1672.74s]  Yurt bag. Okay. Let's see. We have to bait, put bait down. Oh, again, selling traps is my
[1672.74s -> 1685.43s]  sideline. And to help you along, you can have a freebie. Wait, he talks? Wait a minute. This is
[1685.43s -> 1705.96s]  one of the squid billies. Bucky feel. I can tell. It was the frog. Okay. Place the item. I have more
[1705.96s -> 1710.04s]  than one. This is kind of cool. I like this. I get to manage more than one right in the corner.
[1710.04s -> 1716.38s]  Make sure it's perfect or I'll delete my fucking whole account on Twitch. I use that too often.
[1716.38s -> 1721.91s]  You know what I mean? That carries no weight anymore. I say that like every four or five days.
[1721.91s -> 1741.13s]  That doesn't carry any weight anymore. Bait trap. Have we been alert? Okay. How do we use it?
[1751.29s -> 1766.52s]  We need new material. I'm not sure I do. Think about it. All right. We've got to put bait on here.
[1766.92s -> 1778.17s]  Yams? How many yams do I have? Oh, you just buy one. Okay. That's good. Right. Wait for the
[1778.89s -> 1783.38s]  trap to catch the... All right. How do we... Is he just going to walk the whole perimeter?
[1784.02s -> 1794.28s]  I probably should have put this a lot closer. Not all the way across the whole thing.
[1798.01s -> 1813.61s]  Go get it. Why don't you go eat one of those yams? Come on. Make a trail of yams. Let's know. That's
[1813.61s -> 1821.13s]  a waste of money. This one's going for it. Here we go. Geki. I want one of these. I want one of these
[1821.13s -> 1836.94s]  so bad. You can only find the Geki in the desert. You can only find the Geki in the desert.
[1836.94s -> 1850.81s]  I'm just going to say that's an ugly piece of shit lizard. What is wrong with you? Look at him. He's
[1850.81s -> 1856.87s]  perfect. I want you. How do I get you? Okay. A Geki finds it hard to resist a delicate snow drop
[1856.87s -> 1872.39s]  flower. I want one. All right. We need a snow drop flower. How do I get one? I want it. I
[1872.39s -> 1881.75s]  want it now. I want that Geki. I will get you a golden goose when we get home there, darling.
[1882.31s -> 1901.58s]  I want that one, daddy. Mr. Wonka. How much for the golden Geki? It's not for sale. Come on. Will
[1901.58s -> 1917.03s]  somebody eat this? Somebody please. Not today, son. Do the whole movie. I can't do the whole movie.
[1919.88s -> 1925.00s]  Somebody eat this yam. Look at this party. Is this the party they were talking about? Look at how
[1925.00s -> 1936.47s]  much fun they're having. Oh, I need you. I need to have you forever. Somebody eat this.
[1937.27s -> 1955.43s]  Look at this party. They don't even need music. Hey. All right. Can I direct you over here?
[1956.95s -> 1974.33s]  You. Scared? No. Why do I feel like this is exactly, this is exactly the shit that happens
[1974.33s -> 1979.45s]  if you go to a doggy daycare. This is exactly how they all act. This is why I walked back and
[1979.45s -> 1987.48s]  forth like 10 times. I'm going to go around the edge of a whole building 50 times. Who's
[1987.48s -> 1993.61s]  that over there? I don't know. Who are you? Let me see. No. I'll go this way instead.
[1997.72s -> 2004.22s]  This is doggy daycare. And then there's usually one just chewing on a bone over in the corner
[2004.22s -> 2022.65s]  all day. Somebody eat this. All right. Do I have to make another one? Oh God. Okay. Move. Wait.
[2022.65s -> 2030.63s]  What are you doing? What are they doing? The party's over. Party's over. Apparently. What?
[2032.71s -> 2037.53s]  Everybody scram. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2039.82s -> 2049.88s]  God damn it. How did I fuck this up? What happened? This is free, right?
[2053.24s -> 2058.01s]  You scared them. All right. Where the fuck is one of these things?
[2061.16s -> 2065.00s]  I don't know. So did I soft lock myself in the tutorial for a game for five year olds?
[2066.04s -> 2096.92s]  I think I did. I'm fucked. I think I really am. Please come back. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2099.10s -> 2124.87s]  I want one daddy. All right. All right. All right. All right. Put one down. Look. Go eat it.
[2135.13s -> 2139.40s]  Go get over here. Why are they not even coming inside the circle?
[2142.33s -> 2149.85s]  Only one is brave enough to come back after the party pooper. Here we go. Here we go. Come on.
[2150.57s -> 2158.36s]  I'm sorry. I take back everything I said about doggy daycare. If that was, if that was like a,
[2159.08s -> 2163.08s]  if that was like a begging strip on the ground, a hundred dogs are running after that.
[2163.64s -> 2176.78s]  Like, come on. I was incorrect. Get it. Yes. You've eaten. Now you're with friends.
[2177.42s -> 2181.59s]  Oh, what I meant to say was, um, got you.
[2182.31s -> 2192.17s]  Return to the main garden and visit the post office to unpack your trap.
[2192.17s -> 2211.05s]  I have to send this animal through the mail and that wicked fucked up. You're evil. I'm not even
[2211.05s -> 2232.07s]  evil. Oh, there's Fanny Franker. You know, passing stuff on, getting some goodies off other Xbox live
[2232.07s -> 2240.26s]  gardeners doesn't exist anymore. Sorry. All right. Ooh. The trap has triggered.
[2240.26s -> 2242.39s]  And now we have to put, just put it anywhere. It doesn't matter.
[2245.51s -> 2255.00s]  The post office. There's no Xbox live guys. Howdy sweet pea. Welcome to the post office.
[2255.00s -> 2260.20s]  I heard there was a new face in town. We can help you with crate sales, crate delivery,
[2260.20s -> 2266.90s]  messages, invites. You just holler when you've made up your mind. Anybody else like this is
[2266.90s -> 2273.06s]  a nightmare person. Like, don't you see in a nightmare, the flap going up and down
[2273.06s -> 2276.58s]  really fast to like very distinct laughing sounds like,
[2279.86s -> 2292.92s]  while it's fucking running after you. It's fucking terrifying. Deliver this crate to me.
[2295.67s -> 2302.50s]  Sleep around. So does it matter where I put this? Right in the corner. All right. If I then,
[2303.30s -> 2312.42s]  you know what I'm saying? Unpack. Move out of the crate. Ooh, there you go.
[2314.26s -> 2324.30s]  Why is that? Why is it saying my name up there? You have a new sweet old visitor. Congratulations
[2324.30s -> 2333.72s]  on catching this little pinata. Now put the. Okay. How do I make you stay? What is this ominous
[2333.72s -> 2339.24s]  fucking mothership flying over us right now? What is going on? What's the fucking, oh, okay.
[2339.24s -> 2351.80s]  It really is a mothership. You have one square penometer of sand or you need sand.
[2351.80s -> 2357.46s]  So I see you've got a sand critter. Might be just the right time to give you this
[2357.46s -> 2363.93s]  sand packet. It works just like the grass packets and you can find it in the same place on the menu.
[2363.93s -> 2370.68s]  So there should be no problem for you to use. Okay. Cool. Sand packet. So he just needs one
[2370.68s -> 2378.76s]  little meter of sand. Short grass sand. Okay. Let's do a right in the corner.
[2381.46s -> 2392.82s]  This is going to be your little house. What's the snail doing over here? Get out of here.
[2394.02s -> 2403.56s]  Why does this guy always do shit in the corners? Cause you build out. Oh, okay. That was relax.
[2406.95s -> 2419.58s]  Relax. Um, okay. I need to change that. Um, no, no, I'm not going to do,
[2420.14s -> 2427.82s]  I am not going to do medical textbook penis for, no, I'm sorry. I'm not, it has to change.
[2438.57s -> 2455.26s]  That's better. Okay. Are you happy here? Fucking unfollowed. Okay. Sorry. All right. Select.
[2460.54s -> 2472.55s]  Go over here. Look, he's my friend. Apologize. I'm sorry. I said it. I know that wasn't a real
[2472.55s -> 2476.79s]  fault. That was it. I'm sorry. I'm saying this because you're making me. I know. But look,
[2477.91s -> 2484.92s]  name him. What does he want me to direct? Direct over here? Oh, eat this.
[2494.89s -> 2499.53s]  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. Yes, I did. All right. Has eaten one turnip.
[2499.53s -> 2505.42s]  I have a sweet little house in the garden. Okay. This is bad. Romance. What does he want me to do?
[2505.42s -> 2515.70s]  Select and do what? What do you want me to do? Direct it to where? What do you want me to do?
[2521.05s -> 2530.68s]  He's blind. Am I blind? Oh, read the instructions.
[2533.48s -> 2548.89s]  Read. I'm trying to. Oh, so that he's done with the party. Okay. Cool. It's not enough to.
[2551.53s -> 2563.67s]  It's not. Now stop. Oh, didn't I already do this though? I thought I already did this. Oh,
[2563.67s -> 2569.43s]  he has to eat three. Okay. You need to eat three of them. No, no. Eat, eat, eat. Fucking
[2569.43s -> 2583.75s]  mothership returns. All right. Now I can replace this, right? Eat. I need to build a house for you.
[2584.74s -> 2590.95s]  He's eaten one turnip. You need to eat turnips. No, I'm shipping this guy off.
[2597.72s -> 2618.46s]  It's ready to party. All right. It's time to party. Turnips have feelings.
[2638.31s -> 2640.95s]  It's like the future of Amazon package delivery.
[2652.26s -> 2656.18s]  All right. Time for a challenge. One more.
[2659.75s -> 2664.34s]  A bouncing baby piñata. There's going to be a baby shower. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[2664.34s -> 2668.97s]  Romance two piñatas. I will do that. I remember how to do it. Do you still have to do the mini
[2668.97s -> 2679.11s]  game from like the last one? Okay. You've leveled up. You filled the petals around the clock,
[2679.11s -> 2684.39s]  which means you've taken a step closer to becoming a truly great gardener. He remembers.
[2684.39s -> 2690.23s]  All kinds of things happen when you become a better gardener. Costalot store has opened. You
[2690.23s -> 2696.87s]  can buy some paving, some fences, a couple of items to decorate your garden with, and some seeds.
[2696.87s -> 2704.09s]  Oh, that guy. The guy that you hit with the shovel, right? New piñata spotted. Where?
[2704.09s -> 2711.86s]  All right. So these two need to, um, come here, come here, come here. Stop. What are you going?
[2713.43s -> 2720.50s]  Where are you going? I need, they need a house to have romance. Stop flying around.
[2722.94s -> 2726.70s]  He's like got a cursor underneath him. Like he's going to drop. Like what are you doing?
[2726.70s -> 2739.98s]  Is that your firing cursor? Well, there's a crab. It's not a giant crab. It's a regular sized crab.
[2739.98s -> 2752.66s]  Everybody relax. Beach party animals. I love what they want. They're beach party animals.
[2752.66s -> 2764.86s]  So there is sand over here. Sand and sunshine. Okay. All right. Come here. You, you too.
[2764.86s -> 2770.66s]  Actually, no, I need to see what it takes. I need to eat a daisy and we need a bespotty
[2770.66s -> 2791.64s]  house in the garden to make a bespotty house. Oh, there he is. I see. Cool. All right. There's,
[2791.64s -> 2799.32s]  there's no reason ever any human ever on any fucking circumstance. He's obsessed with gathering
[2799.32s -> 2805.59s]  seeds. Go like this. Talking to him. This is, that's like the Nosferatu fucking Dracula like
[2805.59s -> 2810.79s]  hands. Like what, there's no reason to anyone do that. If you do this, that you, that the, I,
[2810.79s -> 2820.74s]  I get away from me. Like that's universal. Like nobody fucking does that. You're in the same house.
[2820.74s -> 2836.97s]  Yeah. I told you. I'm not in a different place. It didn't move. It was all a ruse from day one.
[2836.97s -> 2845.42s]  All right. Let's talk to Acidos. That's pre-recorded. I can prove to you this is not
[2845.42s -> 2856.60s]  pre-recorded. Okay. Oh! Like would I be able to time that perfectly? Oh! No, no way. Today is,
[2856.60s -> 2862.84s]  it's, it's March 28th at 4 15 PM. March 28th, 4 15 PM. March 28th, 4 15 PM. That would have been
[2862.84s -> 2886.20s]  really fucking hard for me to do that. Pull out a newspaper. Pull out a newspaper. You're assuming
[2886.20s -> 2895.77s]  that anybody has newspapers anymore. Oh, there he is. Acidos. I'm Acidos. Take a seat and don't
[2895.77s -> 2909.24s]  hit me with your spade. Oh man. I remember this guy. Oh, we have a worm resident. I wish I put
[2909.24s -> 2915.32s]  the sprayer. It's like there's already dirt here. It's perfect. No, I want the shovel.
[2918.15s -> 2925.98s]  You have improved again. Lottie has some new items in her store including only eight more
[2925.98s -> 2934.79s]  levels. That's kind of a long way to go. All right. Let's plant this like right here.
[2935.51s -> 2954.90s]  Let's get out of my way before you make me angry. What kind of plan is this? Attack him. I'm not
[2954.90s -> 2965.58s]  going to attack him. Oh, a sparrow mint. So how many, how many Pokemons are in this game?
[2966.62s -> 2977.29s]  How many like actually exist in the game? Oh, they can hear the worms. All right. I'm going to
[2977.29s -> 2986.10s]  start to, I'm going to start to do some builds here. Kill him. I'm not going to, you can't kill
[2986.10s -> 2992.41s]  anybody. Oh, there's another one. Let's plant this right next to each other. This is a daisy.
[2992.41s -> 2999.91s]  Somebody has to eat a daisy, don't they? You can't kill anybody, guys. Why does everything have to be
[2999.91s -> 3022.46s]  but like, kill him, kill him, kill. You're killing the animals. I'm not killing the animals. Oh,
[3022.46s -> 3031.14s]  what did that, what's that for? I'm not killing any animals. No, that's a lie. I don't believe
[3031.14s -> 3037.61s]  the people in here saying that. That's a lie. They're lying to you. Be on the lookout for people
[3037.61s -> 3043.61s]  with false information right now on this channel. They're lying to you. Oh, I didn't know it was
[3043.61s -> 3049.83s]  going to be overwatered that far. That's that far. I thought it was a little more. Can you suck that
[3049.83s -> 3055.18s]  up? You can just like suck it up or something. All right. Wait, there's another one of these.
[3056.06s -> 3063.61s]  Give me this thing. I don't like this pavement here. Why would you pave a huge square around
[3063.61s -> 3069.75s]  one flower? Are you stupid? Terrible design, awful craftsmanship,
[3077.19s -> 3084.18s]  and a lot of new animals. Oh, I thought that was his tail for a second.
[3084.66s -> 3092.39s]  Congratulations. You have attracted a sense of flowers. Okay, a taply. No, I don't want, I,
[3092.39s -> 3098.76s]  these things, these things remind me of Otto, but I don't want to. Remember we had too many
[3098.76s -> 3102.92s]  taplys before and everybody freaked out and told me, put tap, put taply in fire.
[3103.56s -> 3112.74s]  Put taply in fire becomes fire taply. It was a lot of, I didn't want to do that anymore.
[3112.74s -> 3118.04s]  All right. I got to, I want to get rid of this shit. How do I like delete an area?
[3120.46s -> 3140.79s]  Shovel. Like I was getting rid of this. This is so dumb. Sell it? What do you mean sell it?
[3140.79s -> 3189.38s]  How do I sell it? No, I want to take a picture. Go on. Yes. Okay. What was I doing?
[3189.46s -> 3197.77s]  Yeah. How do I sell this? Can I do that? I don't think I can sell this stuff guys,
[3197.77s -> 3203.38s]  unless I can't select it or anything. I just delete. Can I just go to the store?
[3204.02s -> 3221.27s]  Go to the store. There is no store. There's the post office. I have to unlock the shop. Okay.
[3224.47s -> 3229.35s]  No, just don't, don't slap that, the mouth up and down really quick and make a laughing noise.
[3229.99s -> 3239.62s]  Oh, this doesn't, this tutorial doesn't matter. Okay. Somebody said, please do a chocolate
[3239.62s -> 3251.38s]  factory stream. What would I even, how would I even do? Would you like, you want to do like a
[3251.38s -> 3269.77s]  travel channel? This is the chocolate factory. Show me how it all works. Yes. So you guys
[3270.57s -> 3280.22s]  unanimously want a chocolate factory tour. There's no jokes here. It's just, hey,
[3280.22s -> 3290.15s]  this was the chocolate factory. This is what you want. There's not going to be like any,
[3290.15s -> 3293.03s]  there's no clowns going to run by her and it's, it's going to be like, that's what it is.
[3293.59s -> 3302.18s]  Okay. Not a joke. Okay. I'll see what I can do. I'll see what I can do. I'll see what I can do.
[3314.02s -> 3320.57s]  He, he, what he, he acts like he doesn't want a factory tour. I mean I do. That's kind of cool.
[3321.13s -> 3334.68s]  I do want that. Okay. I'm going to try it. All right. All right. Let's see what I can do.
[3335.48s -> 3349.03s]  He's going to tour a chocolate factory. Yeah. I don't think this is going to work.
[3353.05s -> 3360.01s]  It's going to be, it's going to be working loud. You don't really hear anything. It's going to be
[3360.01s -> 3366.97s]  like, so what do you think? Like just, you want to feel it. It's going to be like a vacuum cleaner
[3366.97s -> 3377.50s]  in the background constantly. I'm going to have to get like a shitty lapel mic that's going to be
[3377.50s -> 3386.71s]  like, I think that, yeah, that looks like the chocolate coming off the rack there.
[3386.71s -> 3406.84s]  It's going to be the worst dream. All right. Fine. Cut his lapel mic. Fine. Okay. I still
[3406.84s -> 3417.45s]  need to make a hole here with the jelly bean factory. Am I going to start doing like
[3418.89s -> 3424.66s]  candy factory tours? How do I explain this to one of these factories by the way?
[3425.96s -> 3429.24s]  Make a phone call, make a few phone calls, talk to them. Just so I'm just wanting to get in touch
[3429.24s -> 3433.96s]  with you with your like your PR, your marketing or your, you know, your tour department for being,
[3433.96s -> 3439.56s]  you know, on like on camera and do it for like a broadcast. What am I supposed to say? Oh, cool.
[3440.68s -> 3449.10s]  What industry do you work in? Well, I'm like, I'm an e-clown. Oh, so why do you want to do this?
[3449.10s -> 3455.42s]  Is this like a new food channel? No, no, no. I just, one person in my community said that it
[3455.42s -> 3459.82s]  would be a fun idea to do a chocolate factory tour. So that's why I'm here. One person told
[3459.82s -> 3464.92s]  me to do this. Oh, so there's literally, you know, this, that you don't have any reason to be here
[3464.92s -> 3468.92s]  besides this one person told you to do this. Yeah. That's it. And that's, that's pretty much all
[3468.92s -> 3479.13s]  that's going to happen. I'm not like a food blogger. Should I make a food blog in the meantime,
[3479.13s -> 3487.16s]  just to like have a website and just like having for like the next couple of weeks,
[3487.16s -> 3494.33s]  write about like fucking foods I eat and then just send them there and say, hey, I'm an e-clown,
[3494.33s -> 3497.77s]  but I also do have a good a food blog. I just started and really try to, this is like,
[3498.82s -> 3517.82s]  this is like when, like I make it till you make it. Don't eat that. You don't know where it's been.
[3518.86s -> 3530.33s]  Okay. First of all, okay. Fine. I'll do like fucking, I'm going to do my own like fucking
[3530.41s -> 3545.56s]  restaurant guide streams. Like chocolate factories and restaurants. This one's called
[3545.56s -> 3552.49s]  take a bite with Jerma. Take a more than, ah, more than you can chew. Starring Jerma985.
[3553.13s -> 3564.98s]  Got it. Got it. Printed. Done. Welcome back to more than you can chew with Jerma985. I'm here at
[3564.98s -> 3571.46s]  this joint. Well, that's, that's literally just ripping off completely. Um, guy fairy. I can't do
[3571.46s -> 3576.89s]  that. I can't do, I can't do that. I can't talk like that. All right. I need to play this game.
[3576.89s -> 3589.59s]  First of all, why? Why? Why? You, you put an idea in my head and now it's like the only thing I care
[3589.59s -> 3597.96s]  about. All right. I'll make, I'm going to make this happen. No jokes. I had so many other things
[3598.68s -> 3609.11s]  like planned. This is stepping over all of them. All right. You guys need a house. You even need
[3609.11s -> 3616.46s]  a daisy. What the fuck? Don't eat a daisy. You eat a daisy, please. They're over here. Eat it.
[3618.86s -> 3628.70s]  Eat daisy. Go do it tonight. I, I'm sorry. I can't, I can't take a tour of a chocolate factory right
[3628.70s -> 3640.81s]  now. You guys, it's not, it's not possible. All right. You need to eat two of these. One more.
[3640.81s -> 3648.70s]  Has eaten one daisy. What? You just ate it. That's not a daisy. Wait a minute. Did you just not eat
[3648.70s -> 3675.48s]  a daisy? It was a daisy. He just crushed it. What are you doing? Remember you should get bangs before
[3675.48s -> 3688.01s]  showing us the chart. Why would I get bangs? Why do you want me to have bangs? Are you going to eat
[3688.01s -> 3697.90s]  this or what? There you go. All right. You got to eat one more of those. There we go. All right. Now
[3697.90s -> 3711.38s]  we can do it. Now we need a bespotty house in the garden. How do we do that? Uh, nay. Thank you. Nay
[3711.38s -> 3724.74s]  means nay for the 11 community subs. Thanks to the fucking 11 sub drop. Well, I don't want,
[3724.74s -> 3731.93s]  why do you want me to keep doing this? There's something deeply wrong with your audience.
[3738.95s -> 3750.79s]  Okay. I'm sorry. All right, guys. Stop being so weird. You're scaring people off. Stop being so
[3750.79s -> 3766.22s]  weird. No, no. Yes. Uh, I am the ruler of the kingdom and the rule of the kingdom says to relax.
[3766.22s -> 3782.70s]  I have a new visitor? Never. No. Fuck the king. Uh oh. What have I done? We are influenced by you,
[3782.70s -> 3790.62s]  weirdo. No, don't. Don't do that. Captain Crunchy, thanks for the five community subs.
[3790.62s -> 3802.62s]  Jerma sucks. Thanks for the five community subs. Thanks both of you. Cool. Hey, cool. Thanks.
[3804.92s -> 3811.56s]  Finally, we can build a house. We need a, uh, build a house for the beskotties. A beskottie house.
[3816.12s -> 3817.64s]  There it is. How much does it cost? Zero. Good.
[3821.56s -> 3841.14s]  Now what if? No. God damn it. Don't fucking do this. No, it's, I can't right now.
[3842.10s -> 3849.86s]  I can't do that right now. It's not possible. I can't do it. It's not possible. I can't.
[3852.66s -> 3861.29s]  I actually can't. I was gonna say instead of going to a real chocolate factory, just do a huge
[3861.29s -> 3868.25s]  fucking bit where they make a fake chocolate factory and go through a tour with like six
[3868.25s -> 3878.25s]  different people and they're all characters and like I'm in a costume and shit. It's just,
[3878.25s -> 3888.71s]  it's just Willy Wonka, but it's not. Oh, there's a lot of, that's a lot of money and I can't,
[3888.71s -> 3893.43s]  right? This is like all the, that's not possible right now. Maybe, maybe in the future.
[3893.43s -> 3904.28s]  All right, I gotta put this down. You're a, I'm not a millionaire. I don't know if you'll get
[3904.28s -> 3918.01s]  this idea. I don't have, I don't have millions of dollars. This is, this is like, this is like
[3918.01s -> 3936.57s]  expensive. Making a fake chocolate factory is, that's extreme. You own two houses. Oh,
[3936.57s -> 3950.15s]  I don't own two houses. What are you talking about? He owns three. That was very, I'm kidding.
[3951.88s -> 3956.28s]  No, but for real, that's, I'll have to figure out how I want to do that. That'd be really fun.
[3956.28s -> 3967.22s]  He owns a Boston vacation house. I don't own that. Stop.
[3969.62s -> 3979.77s]  Tore, tore a sewage plant and pretend it's a chocolate factory. Holy shit.
[3989.34s -> 3993.82s]  And the whole time, the whole time I'm asking questions about like, so what do you wrap it
[3993.82s -> 3998.14s]  and everything? And they're just, they keep correcting me. This is not a chocolate factory.
[3998.14s -> 4003.13s]  What's wrong with you? So I see up there, is that, is that where the, is that where the vanilla
[4003.13s -> 4011.43s]  paste is added? This is, this is shit up there. What's wrong with you? The whole time, I'm just
[4011.43s -> 4025.58s]  so fucked up and so oblivious. I think that's where I am. This is very, oh, they have like a
[4025.58s -> 4045.11s]  nice little driveway. Just ask for money from your 985 relatives. I can't, okay. This is
[4045.11s -> 4055.91s]  fucked up and wicked fucking disgusting, but I can't even say it. Okay. So, oh, come on.
[4055.91s -> 4065.53s]  Do you know where it could go? I'm not going to, I can't, I can't even talk about this. We're
[4065.53s -> 4078.92s]  going to move on. I can't talk about that. It's too fucked up. It's too fucked up. It's too fucked up.
[4079.64s -> 4083.88s]  I can't, I can't, there's too many people here. There's 5,000 fucking people. I can't be on,
[4083.88s -> 4088.04s]  I can't record myself saying this in front of 5,000 people. My mother would be so ashamed of me.
[4088.76s -> 4106.17s]  All right, let's open it. Ta-da. Make bugleberry say it. It's not even you. Oh, that's not,
[4107.05s -> 4116.46s]  that's not how this works. I, I can't, I can't like plead insanity to my mother. Oh, it's okay.
[4116.46s -> 4127.10s]  No, it's okay. My mother's going to be very upset with me. I can't, I can't do that to my mother.
[4127.66s -> 4141.18s]  Here, I'll say it. Just type it to me. I'll say it. No, no, no. Okay. I was just, I was going to say,
[4142.14s -> 4146.22s]  let's, let's just, okay, let's make these two bugs. Let's just, let's just let these two bugs
[4146.22s -> 4155.00s]  have sex with each other and maybe we'll, oh, don't hit them. Come here. You guys ready? Oh,
[4155.00s -> 4165.75s]  no, no, no, wrong. It's these two. And here we go. We're going to have some bespotty children.
[4175.03s -> 4181.35s]  I always go, okay. Welcome to the romancing mini game. Like this, no. You need to take
[4181.35s -> 4185.83s]  control of your pinata and try to reach your partner without hitting any loavers.
[4186.55s -> 4189.75s]  The loavers are creatures created by Professor Pester and they hate the pinata being happy.
[4189.75s -> 4198.15s]  It's so fucking messed up. I can't say it. But it's kind of funny. If you hit a loafer,
[4198.15s -> 4202.15s]  you will lose a chance and waste some of your time. If you lose all of your time.
[4202.15s -> 4209.37s]  All right. So like the sewer water is coming down, right? Just like through like a pipe.
[4210.17s -> 4218.41s]  It's like, and I'm like, oh wow, cool, man. It's like a fountain. Like can I try it? I just like
[4218.41s -> 4233.58s]  dip my head underneath it and like, and it's like, you know, when like a huge amount of water
[4233.58s -> 4241.46s]  in a very concentrated beam, like it hits a part of your body and it just like it fucking goes
[4241.46s -> 4256.09s]  everywhere. Imagine that like directly in the forehead. There you go. That's what I was thinking.
[4256.09s -> 4259.85s]  I didn't say anything. I just that's what that's what I was thinking and it's like ridiculous.
[4259.85s -> 4266.06s]  Okay. I said, I said the sewer. I said the water. I said the sewer water coming down
[4266.70s -> 4276.70s]  and say anything else. Okay. This is game over. How did I get a game over? Your mom is my mom.
[4276.70s -> 4284.73s]  No, mom. I know you, mom. I know you're watching. Just remember I almost ate a shoe on camera.
[4284.73s -> 4290.49s]  Okay. Like just, I don't know. We talked about that and it was like, don't do that, honey, please.
[4290.49s -> 4297.18s]  I was like, mom, I'm not gonna eat a shoe on camera. I'm not going to unless, unless in a
[4297.18s -> 4300.94s]  few days, maybe they get like a hundred million, like 10 million channel points will come in and
[4300.94s -> 4308.84s]  maybe I'll do it. Oh, the romancing mini game. Right. Okay. Let's go. The old saying goes,
[4308.84s -> 4315.03s]  you can't hurry love. And that's especially true on Pinata Island these days. You'll notice that
[4315.03s -> 4320.87s]  the object of your affections will be none too pleased if you make your approach before proving
[4320.87s -> 4325.43s]  your feelings. To do this, you need to collect the required number of love hearts.
[4325.43s -> 4330.09s]  You'll do anything for money. Oh, stop. I won't do anything for money.
[4332.25s -> 4337.85s]  But I do like that word. I do like that word money. Any heart tokens you leave behind. No,
[4337.85s -> 4345.61s]  I won't. Okay. To do this, you need to collect the number of hearts and you get a bit of meter.
[4345.61s -> 4358.95s]  Okay. Let's go. Okay. All right. You've walked in the way. This is tricky. This actually is
[4358.95s -> 4366.47s]  tricky. This actually, this actually, this actually is actually, this actually is actually
[4366.47s -> 4377.96s]  tricky. Oh, fuck it. This time of it. Holy fuck. I was lost. Actually, it's actually, it was actually.
[4379.37s -> 4389.45s]  Yep. Now you've completed the game. Your happy pinatas will go into their house
[4389.45s -> 4395.13s]  and do a romance dance. And this is, they do the dance, right? Do we get to,
[4395.13s -> 4399.43s]  I really don't want to say this part out loud, but do we, the last time in the last game,
[4399.43s -> 4405.77s]  do we get to, do we get to, um, in the last game, you can, they did a dance on camera.
[4405.77s -> 4414.70s]  Do we get to watch? I don't, okay. First thing I thought that was a dead snake. I was like,
[4414.70s -> 4427.67s]  holy shit. You want, no, they do like a dance and can't you see? Yeah. It does it automatically.
[4427.67s -> 4471.75s]  Great. The storkos. Your pinatas have made an egg. Your pinatas have done the romance dance.
[4471.75s -> 4476.71s]  A new baby pinata is brought to the garden safely packed in a patterned egg.
[4477.35s -> 4484.55s]  Oh, so now we're gonna wait for that to hash. Level four already. What is level four? You really
[4484.55s -> 4496.14s]  seem to have taken a shine to this garden. New store items. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Uh, you,
[4496.14s -> 4501.54s]  I don't, uh, don't eat that. You know what? You can't eat that. Don't eat that. Your new
[4501.54s -> 4507.22s]  egg has been delivered safely. Don't eat that. Just, excuse me. You, you are encroaching on
[4507.22s -> 4519.74s]  my property. That's the only wormhole that I have. Just murdered him. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.
[4522.50s -> 4528.62s]  All right. Now go back in and do it again. Go eat a daisy and do it again. Cause I need more
[4528.62s -> 4539.77s]  bespotties. Oh, he moved in. He ate one of my friends and decided to move in. Well, that's
[4539.77s -> 4551.59s]  great. Why is my frog in prison? Is he not? What do you mean prison? I mean, yeah, he kind of is.
[4551.59s -> 4569.29s]  How do I free the frog? I didn't even know. Uh-oh. Apple, right? Sour shelly bean.
[4577.26s -> 4582.86s]  Seed feast. All right. Uh, this is, I feed, this is the same way in the last game. I feed it a, uh,
[4582.86s -> 4591.16s]  an apple seed and they become my friend, right? Do the Gary. Do Gary. No, I'm not gonna do Gary.
[4591.16s -> 4596.60s]  Do Gary. Do Gary. Oh man. I can't. No, I'm not gonna do Gary. All right. All right.
[4598.71s -> 4604.15s]  Ah, all right. You know, people are begging me. Have to. Every time a new pinata is hatched in
[4604.15s -> 4610.31s]  your garden, your label is fixed to it. You can change your label by using the label designer.
[4612.57s -> 4627.02s]  Where does it ship these up? You want to get rid of? Pack. Are we going to fire them out of the can?
[4627.02s -> 4633.88s]  Wait, this is a baby. Hold on a second. Have I, did I just take their baby and I'm going to fire
[4633.88s -> 4653.10s]  the baby out of a cannon to a party? Congratulations on romancing your bespottis. You breezed through
[4653.10s -> 4665.37s]  that. Well, it looks like. That's crazy. That poor baby. Hey everyone. You should all know
[4665.37s -> 4671.37s]  my store is open again. I expect to see you in here very soon. Just bring lots of cash.
[4672.33s -> 4676.01s]  Nobody likes the taste of chocolate coins more than Lottie, I can tell you.
[4676.81s -> 4681.05s]  I love chocolate coins. I used to pretend they waste to play poker with them.
[4681.05s -> 4686.22s]  And then we would use them instead of money or chips. It was so much fun.
[4687.59s -> 4704.87s]  Okay, remove the fence. He's a child gambler. You guys didn't, when you were like a teenager,
[4704.87s -> 4712.87s]  you didn't play like chocolate coin cards. You guys didn't play like Oreo poker.
[4714.54s -> 4730.78s]  Nobody in here played Oreo poker. You, what the fuck? That's like, you didn't play like
[4730.78s -> 4740.04s]  war for like Oreos. The fuck is, what the fuck is going on? No, we play Fortnite.
[4746.34s -> 4763.14s]  We play, we play Fortnite for Oreos. All right, let's do, I need to get some seeds. I need to
[4763.14s -> 4772.14s]  build, okay. I need a sweet little house. I need, what do I need? Okay. Get out of here. Leave him
[4772.14s -> 4777.27s]  alone. Leave him alone. He didn't do anything. You're like, you're just being annoying to the
[4777.27s -> 4793.85s]  frog. Okay. Let's go to the store. Don't play with your food. Well, then tell them to stop making
[4794.57s -> 4798.73s]  chicken nuggets in the shape of dinosaurs. Not my fault.
[4798.81s -> 4804.39s]  Or whether you're here to buy or sell, which will it be today? Highlight and select one
[4804.39s -> 4812.71s]  and let's get those coins flowing shopping. All right. Paving. But now I, I can select this
[4812.71s -> 4821.24s]  and I can sell all the shit that's over here. Right. You're buying, huh? Is there, how do I
[4821.24s -> 4830.71s]  just sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell. Okay. This is the dino nuggets are good.

[4843.98s -> 4851.83s]  Wait, how is it a toad? What is it? That's a toad. Oh no, your name is toad. Right. Okay.
[4851.83s -> 4873.42s]  They're okay. I guess you can make my garden as I see fit. Yes. If not for spending, I'd spend,

[5032.84s -> 5035.60s]  It's just a bunch of money that you just gave me in bits right now
[5035.60s -> 5041.68s]  That's that's pretty much all there is to it. I can't fucking believe that you did that and there's no message. It's just
[5042.20s -> 5047.26s]  I'm fucking forever grateful. Thank you. Thanks a lot
[5048.26s -> 5051.14s]  Chocolate funds play Resident Evil 4

[5056.76s -> 5059.82s]  Yeah, I actually here's the thing. I want to play Resident Evil 4 for the Wii
[5060.88s -> 5066.41s]  Because that's the best version and uh, but I know a lot of people gonna say PC play piece
[5066.41s -> 5071.81s]  No, the Resident Evil 4 for the Wii version is the best version. I'm not playing it PC
[5072.41s -> 5081.97s]  Resident Evil 4 for the Wii by streaming tomorrow. Yes, but we're gonna we're gonna continue to do these reduced
[5082.61s -> 5085.13s]  Stream hours for a little while until
[5086.41s -> 5089.33s]  Just to be up to be frank with you to be upfront with you
[5089.89s -> 5091.01s]  a
[5091.01s -> 5095.89s]  Lot of services and a lot of stuff has slowed down a lot since all the corona virus stuff
[5096.21s -> 5099.83s]  But that's why it's taking a little bit more time. It's kind of get it all done
[5100.57s -> 5102.78s]  so that's why
[5102.78s -> 5104.78s]  Didn't really get everything done that we wanted to
[5105.34s -> 5112.55s]  But that's just you know, that's the way it is right now, you know have to do we can right?
[5113.07s -> 5116.97s]  So over the next week or so

[6024.88s -> 6032.92s]  No, that's not correct. It's not to who
[6034.83s -> 6036.15s]  You who?

[6892.74s -> 6898.50s]  Probably not how quickly could I lose every single viewer? It wouldn't take very much time
[6900.12s -> 6904.68s]  I would just play white noise as loud as I can possibly go and turn it up all the way to like plus 5000 db
[6905.00s -> 6907.00s]  You would just everybody would leave you have to
[6910.68s -> 6913.40s]  Like the people wouldn't stay for that as much as people like pretend like they would
[6915.59s -> 6921.28s]  All right, here we go
[6921.92s -> 6928.60s]  You want to experiment no, i'm i'm i'm playing uh, i'm playing viva piñata. I want to like just kill
[6929.24s -> 6934.60s]  I don't want to blast white noise for 25 straight minutes. Why i'm not doing that right now
[6942.72s -> 6944.72s]  Or I know I mean, I know a way that it would
[6946.36s -> 6951.04s]  I could I would probably lose two or three thousand concurrent people that are here right now
[6951.86s -> 6954.23s]  if I like switch to like
[6954.23s -> 6956.07s]  like singing stream
[6956.07s -> 6958.07s]  and like I was actually trying like
[6958.31s -> 6963.35s]  Really really hard and it wasn't my I was really off key and shit and I was looking right in the camera
[6964.07s -> 6966.76s]  If I was looking directly in the camera and singing
[6967.08s -> 6969.64s]  I think at least three or four probably three thousand people would leave instantly
[6971.46s -> 6973.33s]  so
[6973.33s -> 6977.09s]  And then i'm not like jokey like that. I got a feeling not not like that
[6977.17s -> 6980.21s]  I'm talking like i'm looking in the camera and singing like add everybody here
[6981.25s -> 6985.35s]  I think it would take wouldn't take very long because i'm I can't i'm not like that great at singing
[6985.91s -> 6990.07s]  And if I was like taking a dead serious, I feel like people would be like I gotta fucking get out of here, man
[7000.90s -> 7003.14s]  Dude like
[7003.14s -> 7008.34s]  Really deep songs to not like rock and roll or like a beat or pop
[7008.98s -> 7014.23s]  Like really like deep emotional song. I feel like people would be like, uh, i'm not really into this
[7022.48s -> 7024.48s]  You think you would say you would not
[7025.04s -> 7027.84s]  All right. We got turnips. We got daisies. I need to wear those. Uh,

[7093.00s -> 7096.76s]  You don't you don't understand
[7096.76s -> 7099.48s]  I would go all in on it and it'd be like
[7102.68s -> 7104.84s]  Like it would be like that for like 30 minutes
[7105.80s -> 7107.80s]  With like instrumental behind me
[7112.52s -> 7118.76s]  You'd hate that they can move in any direction and we'll try to chase you down and zap you with their pesky pest power
[7118.76s -> 7120.44s]  If you get too close
[7120.44s -> 7123.96s]  They're all so indestructible to boot. So take care

[13764.27s -> 13767.07s]  All the coronavirus stuff. I'm not sure that would be possible
[13767.87s -> 13771.70s]  We'll see though

[13834.16s -> 13836.46s]  Me too. It's a really fun chill game
[13838.18s -> 13846.86s]  Yeah, we're taking we're taking it slow and we need to kind of
[13847.82s -> 13850.30s]  Get to where we need to be
[13850.30s -> 13852.48s]  And do it slow
[13852.48s -> 13854.08s]  at a good pace
[13854.08s -> 13856.32s]  but slow enough where we can actually get stuff done and
[13856.88s -> 13858.88s]  To work around some of the companies that
[13859.36s -> 13874.82s]  Um have some coronavirus uh restrictions. So we're taking it slow, but thanks for the 250
[13875.74s -> 13878.58s]  Uh, stay safe

[13891.38s -> 13893.38s]  It's a good game pepe hands
[13893.38s -> 13901.47s]  What do I do now?
[13901.47s -> 13903.23s]  We cross the threshold
[13903.23s -> 13907.81s]  Those of you that don't know some of you new viewers don't know what the threshold is and that's a huge quote
[13908.69s -> 13910.69s]  The threshold is I play a game
[13911.09s -> 13913.17s]  And I say yeah, I might go back to this
[13913.17s -> 13917.33s]  Uh, maybe like uh, maybe next week or something. Uh, and two weeks go by
[13918.19s -> 13920.85s]  After the 14th day
[13920.85s -> 13925.65s]  You've passed the threshold on if i'm gonna go back and play it. So
[13926.45s -> 13932.35s]  We've passed it
[13932.35s -> 13936.77s]  holo night pepe hands
[13941.18s -> 13942.94s]  DOS games, no
[13942.94s -> 13944.94s]  Fucking pepe hands
[13946.62s -> 13949.98s]  Sir's wrath dlc. Oh pepe hands

[13960.42s -> 13961.78s]  Well
[13961.78s -> 13966.40s]  Put your pepe hands down for a second on that one. I want to play that I want to play vr
[13966.48s -> 13970.48s]  There's like so many good vr games that just can't physically do it right now. That's not a pepe hand scenario
[13970.96s -> 13976.91s]  That's a you wait and see scenario. We didn't pass the threshold on that one. I'm still there
[13982.32s -> 13985.12s]  Sit down and play alex
[13985.12s -> 13987.52s]  I think the the device on my head
[13989.01s -> 13993.90s]  Because it's kind of heavy and annoying. I feel like that's gonna put pressure down on me. I
[13996.51s -> 14001.23s]  Very soon here i'm gonna have some actual real answers for what i'm doing with my life
[14002.03s -> 14004.03s]  in regards to my medical stuff
[14004.03s -> 14005.49s]  so
[14005.49s -> 14017.28s]  We'll cross that bridge soon reason for the short stream. Yes, the next few streams will be like this
[14018.16s -> 14019.44s]  because
[14019.44s -> 14021.20s]  Right after I turn this off
[14021.20s -> 14023.20s]  I'm going back to the moving process
[14025.63s -> 14028.35s]  I just wanted to make sure that I didn't not stream
[14029.97s -> 14032.85s]  potentially like a full week or two straight
[14033.57s -> 14037.89s]  Because I do want to stream I want to hang out and play games and just chill and dick around I love doing it
[14038.69s -> 14042.13s]  So anytime I can put some time in and do what I want to so
[14042.85s -> 14051.62s]  He just wants to eat a burrito. Shh
[14052.74s -> 14054.32s]  Say that
[14054.32s -> 14061.33s]  He's gonna move from his stream computer to his bed
[14065.78s -> 14069.78s]  He's just gonna sit in the chair till four pacific. Oh my god
[14071.49s -> 14073.65s]  Anyways dark soul, thanks for the 250 tonight
[14073.65s -> 14080.37s]  I learned that trying to fake vr with resident evil 2 first person and vore px makes you instantly sick
[14080.93s -> 14082.53s]  Never try that shit
[14082.53s -> 14086.67s]  Also, when are you going to collaborate with someone from hollow live? You've already said ayaya
[14086.75s -> 14089.31s]  So you may as well. I have no idea what that is
[14090.27s -> 14099.22s]  If you said I will give you a million dollars if you tell me what hollow live is
[14100.58s -> 14105.15s]  Um, I would not get the million dollars. I would cry and go home and be like how the fuck
[14105.15s -> 14106.67s]  I don't know what that is
[14106.67s -> 14109.42s]  No, and I said the word. Yeah, whatever
[14111.49s -> 14113.97s]  He said it get him obstinare wall lover
[14114.53s -> 14121.70s]  Thanks to the 278 bits. Do you prefer 2k 14 wwe or 2k 15 to 2k 20 creative?
[14122.58s -> 14124.58s]  He's doing emote contest
[14124.74s -> 14128.50s]  Uh, everything after 2k 14 is absolute absolute dog shit
[14130.64s -> 14135.84s]  They just pulled the rug out from underneath the creative process that that game had after 2k 14
[14136.32s -> 14141.98s]  2k 15 all the way to now it's just been utter dog shit just dog shit
[14142.70s -> 14148.62s]  They cared more about having a realistic fucking sports simulation than having fun characters fight each other in a ring
[14148.78s -> 14153.50s]  That's what happened. That is just what happened when the companies changed over the the new company that took it over was like
[14153.50s -> 14154.94s]  Let's make this a sports game
[14154.94s -> 14160.35s]  And it was the biggest mistake that they ever made and from my understanding now the last one they made
[14160.67s -> 14165.39s]  Was an absolute total fucking joke of a video game. It was riddled with just awful bugs
[14165.87s -> 14168.27s]  No new features. It was a piece of dog shit from what i've heard
[14168.75s -> 14175.15s]  Um, so it did it did it turned into it turned into like the like a madden or like an mlb 2k fucking 20
[14175.39s -> 14181.92s]  But they just release a roster update and uh tweak the fucking fighting mechanic. He's so passionate about this
[14182.16s -> 14187.92s]  Yeah, I am because that's one of my favorite things on earth was making characters
[14188.38s -> 14193.18s]  In wrestling games and making them fight each other. I've been doing this shit since I was like fucking 13
[14194.00s -> 14196.16s]  Oh, I mean I could we could sit here with I could sit up
[14196.24s -> 14198.72s]  Grab a fucking cup of coffee right now and sit here for two hours
[14198.96s -> 14202.16s]  And talk to you about how much of a how much of a fucking injustice this is
[14202.48s -> 14210.26s]  I would sit here for like an hour straight. Anyways, uh, it was a big mistake
[14211.31s -> 14214.00s]  And I don't know who was responsible for that
[14214.00s -> 14216.48s]  There's a lot of people a lot of moving parts in that
[14217.04s -> 14217.84s]  where
[14217.84s -> 14221.68s]  Making it a more realistic sports kind of game rather than
[14222.59s -> 14227.55s]  Look, you're making a bunch of crazy monsters and you're doing fighting and CPUs are fighting each other in the ring
[14228.18s -> 14232.50s]  I don't know, but they've been stripping pieces of it for the last five years
[14236.67s -> 14241.55s]  I would do 2k 14. I would play it and I would continue to make characters and do rumbles on it
[14241.79s -> 14244.03s]  But it's so old at this point
[14244.03s -> 14246.27s]  It takes forever to do fucking anything in that engine
[14247.47s -> 14253.87s]  If you have more than five ten fifteen layers five layers on a character and you're painting on their face with something
[14254.45s -> 14260.86s]  You'll you'll press the button to do a circle and wait four straight seconds for the game to load the circle
[14261.79s -> 14265.39s]  It's just it's just old at this point on old hardware is not
[14265.71s -> 14275.71s]  It's just I can't I could never go back into that again. Wait for that new aew game. We'll see we'll see what happens
[14276.66s -> 14278.66s]  I know that um, was it yukes?
[14279.17s -> 14285.79s]  Didn't yukes broke off completely and was like fuck this we want to make our own video game from my from my understanding
[14285.87s -> 14289.97s]  That's in big quotes yukes was like this is boring the fuck out of us
[14290.45s -> 14292.82s]  Uh, we need to creatively
[14292.88s -> 14296.82s]  Re-imagine the series a little bit for ourselves and we want to make another game. That's a wrestling game
[14297.22s -> 14300.72s]  That's what i've heard
[14300.72s -> 14304.16s]  That's very encouraging because let's hope that they actually make something fun
[14306.83s -> 14313.28s]  I wish them the absolute best of luck and all the support and I hope they're passionate and I hope they make something good
[14313.52s -> 14321.54s]  That's all I can do but moving on uh, thank you
[14322.24s -> 14328.37s]  Nv11 casting for the 250 remember yesterday was my 21st birthday and it was pretty stressful
[14328.69s -> 14334.06s]  I can think of no better birthday gift than my favorite streamer. This is in all capitals singing
[14334.14s -> 14343.62s]  Happy birthday as poorly as possible jokes. Oh, it's a joke. It was a joke
[14343.94s -> 14347.87s]  They say jokes aside, uh, you don't have to sing if you don't want to look at that
[14348.11s -> 14354.38s]  But i'd appreciate any beverage suggestions you might have thanks for the laughs. I got one for you
[14356.11s -> 14372.75s]  Uh sprite a little bit of cranberry juice squeeze the lime happy
[14374.03s -> 14377.57s]  the rest

[14382.34s -> 14386.74s]  I'm planning on getting two rats next semester and i'm in the process coming up with names. Do you have any suggestions?
[14387.52s -> 14392.40s]  Um, yeah black and blue, you know
[14392.48s -> 14407.52s]  Like is that because they fucking pray at night and they fucking stalk at night those are shit names like they're bruisers
[14407.52s -> 14422.62s]  Yeah to the two bruisers you have to try try harder. I like those names try what do you mean?
[14422.62s -> 14430.53s]  Try harder spaghetti and meatballs. That's way worse than what I said
[14430.85s -> 14440.96s]  If you name don't name any of your animals fart fart. That's such a bad. What a terrible name
[14441.12s -> 14449.15s]  Don't know. I can't believe people are laughing at that like give me a frank guys
[14450.66s -> 14459.31s]  Really my well my my cat's name is art
[14464.03s -> 14466.03s]  Okay
[14466.11s -> 14467.55s]  You wouldn't think that was real
[14467.55s -> 14472.43s]  But if it was that's actually kind of funny that it is real because it's such a that's such a rotten
[14472.99s -> 14475.90s]  awful terrible name
[14475.90s -> 14481.66s]  That if you just saw like fart the cat lying down on the windowsill or something just sitting there with his eyes closed
[14482.54s -> 14484.54s]  Like holy shit, that is the cat's name
[14492.85s -> 14502.54s]  That's such a bad name don't name your cat art thanks for the 500 bits
[14503.26s -> 14508.94s]  Uh scruffle. Thanks for the 400 bits cough cough. I don't know. I don't understand. This is why you coughing
[14510.30s -> 14513.82s]  Did I say are you like trying to tell me something like hey, uh, excuse me
[14514.62s -> 14518.21s]  What did I do? What did I say?
[14518.21s -> 14524.85s]  Tar alacran, thanks for the 250 bits. I doubted that you would stream this weekend. I was gravely in error
[14525.25s -> 14530.61s]  However, i'm a man of my word and gave you permission to ban me if you streamed and chat must have their ban
[14531.41s -> 14536.21s]  I throw myself at the mercy of you and chat and ask that you commute my sentence
[14536.53s -> 14543.41s]  From a lifetime lifetime ban to only a ban for a week. I swear. I will be a reform chatter who never doubts the streamer
[14544.21s -> 14571.55s]  Yes, man. No mercy thumbs down thumbs
[14572.59s -> 14576.94s]  What do you mean? I actually did it?
[14577.26s -> 14580.59s]  What do you mean?
[14580.59s -> 14588.10s]  We have to have justice. It's like oh sire. I'm so sorry
[14588.50s -> 14592.82s]  Yes, I threw a javelin through your window and skimmed your forehead
[14593.98s -> 14598.38s]  And was trying to kill you. I was trying to murder you sire
[14598.86s -> 14600.86s]  But please just know
[14601.10s -> 14607.74s]  That fuck you and I die hate you but I am willing for you to drop me into the pit of the lions
[14608.22s -> 14611.58s]  But just know that I only expect to be in there for a day
[14612.06s -> 14615.26s]  And if I can make it a day then I want you to release me
[14618.82s -> 14620.82s]  So you don't make the terms
[14621.47s -> 14623.47s]  It seems your terms
[14624.34s -> 14632.16s]  Are unacceptable that was a convoluted example
[14637.60s -> 14643.36s]  It'll be back in i'll i'll unban them tomorrow. It's fine. I'll put my hand down to the fucking lion pit
[14644.86s -> 14648.70s]  And i'll be like, i'm just kidding. It was a joke. Let me see your
[14650.62s -> 14652.62s]  And then my hand gets fucking ripped off
[14654.30s -> 14656.62s]  Ah, it turns out hubris is the real killer
[14657.10s -> 14666.83s]  Anyways, what what what what happened? I just banned somebody for like, yeah. Oh, okay. I'll unban them tomorrow. I'll probably forget
[14667.31s -> 14671.49s]  I probably guys i've like told you that I was playing a certain game like tomorrow and I don't play it
[14671.73s -> 14675.65s]  So if i'm gonna forget about what i'm even streaming tomorrow, you think i'm gonna remember unbanning this guy?
[14676.05s -> 14683.70s]  I'm gonna forget i'm gonna forget forever
[14684.42s -> 14690.98s]  Okay, one of the mods unban tara alecran as of tomorrow at 7 32 pm specific standard time
[14691.62s -> 14696.40s]  I have a ban log. Okay
[14696.40s -> 14700.02s]  And I did ban the right person. There was no misspelling there. I didn't like add it
[14700.02s -> 14706.58s]  I had like an extra c or something. Hey goo berry juice
[14706.58s -> 14709.86s]  Thanks to the 250 I doubted that you would stream this weekend. I was gravely in error
[14709.94s -> 14714.58s]  However, i'm a man of my word and gave you permission to ban me if you streamed chat must have their ban
[14714.90s -> 14732.58s]  I throw wait, why is another person saying this just banned that guy too
[14741.74s -> 14744.46s]  You just you killed that you banned the wrong guy
[14745.18s -> 14750.80s]  All right, that was goo berry juice
[14750.80s -> 14756.72s]  Okay, by the way, just i'll give you another convoluted fucked up messed up like go around in five circles example
[14757.52s -> 14759.52s]  If there's a guy in front of you
[14759.52s -> 14761.52s]  And he's robbed a bank
[14761.60s -> 14763.84s]  Okay, and he's got a bag of money
[14764.74s -> 14766.42s]  And he's like I gotta get out of here
[14766.42s -> 14771.86s]  I just robbed the fucking bank and like money is flying out of his the bag and he's running down the street and he's like
[14773.06s -> 14775.06s]  Cops everywhere. You're just watching this happen
[14775.70s -> 14778.34s]  Don't um, don't run after that guy
[14779.26s -> 14785.55s]  And chant that you're also robbing the bank at the same time like me too. I'm robbing the bank too
[14786.11s -> 14788.91s]  Yeah, we both together. We're both robbing the bank together
[14790.10s -> 14792.98s]  I don't think you should do that. You're gonna get you're gonna get arrested
[14795.95s -> 14802.82s]  Uh, because that's just what happened and i've got him i've got justice has to be served
[14809.18s -> 14811.34s]  You don't want to you don't want to participate in that
[14812.70s -> 14815.36s]  I'm just saying hey grave embrace. Thanks for 250
[14816.29s -> 14820.61s]  I streamed doom for 14 and a half hours. I would say it's pretty good, but look out for the glitches
[14821.01s -> 14826.93s]  Some bosses have invincibility mechanics that depend on range, but doesn't properly gauge the range other than that
[14827.01s -> 14831.89s]  It's a whoa. That sounds terrible. Can't wait to not play that terrible fucking game
[14832.53s -> 14837.89s]  Wow, maybe there's a bug. It's a small like glitch or something. Get that off my list
[14837.97s -> 14843.55s]  I want nothing to do with it. I am I am appalled
[14844.19s -> 14847.71s]  And and offended that it would be released in a state like that
[14848.19s -> 14851.95s]  I want nothing to do with that shot. Why would I stream it? Yeah, thank you
[14852.03s -> 14856.56s]  Why would I stream that game god if i'm yelling thinking i've been playing on my own time
[14856.88s -> 14866.46s]  So i'm i'm not gonna stream it. No. Hey goiki. Thanks for the 500 bits

[14912.30s -> 14913.58s]  because
[14913.58s -> 14915.58s]  I know that a lot of people right now are
[14916.22s -> 14922.46s]  Kind of just in their houses looking for something to do and i'm kind of the same way
[14923.33s -> 14931.63s]  So I would love to be here just I have to get this done
[14932.19s -> 14938.43s]  I'll see you tomorrow. We'll keep going with uh
[14939.15s -> 14941.15s]  viva piñata travel in paradise
[14943.46s -> 14946.02s]  Thanks for the support all of you
[14946.66s -> 14950.18s]  There's a piñata in the corner
[14952.46s -> 14954.94s]  It might be
[14954.94s -> 14961.20s]  Thanks for the subs. We have some bits to do left. There's still a little bit left. We have rtx 4 20 69 ti
[14962.85s -> 14966.69s]  Eventually, they'll have to have that number although just skip it because they're too embarrassed to have it
[14968.82s -> 14970.18s]  Uh, thanks for the 250. Hey germs
[14970.18s -> 14979.98s]  I went shopping recently and I realized that germa raptor is incorrect and inaccurate. I don't understand
[14980.54s -> 14983.30s]  Germa raptor is incorrect and inaccurate
[14983.86s -> 14990.21s]  Because you went shopping
[14990.21s -> 14992.21s]  I don't get it. He's a fake
[14995.38s -> 15001.22s]  Oh, and they say there's another here's another 250. Oops. I did my bits early. Here's what I meant to say germa raptor is inaccurate
[15004.16s -> 15010.74s]  Oh, I see
[15010.98s -> 15013.14s]  Okay, so that's the yeah. Well, what?
[15013.94s -> 15015.94s]  That's right, they look the same
[15016.10s -> 15018.10s]  Of raptor faces of whatever
[15021.82s -> 15031.39s]  It's not it's a diet. Uh, really gonna you're gonna throw me under the bus here. Look
[15032.19s -> 15035.42s]  That's a raptor. It's not a raptor. That's et
[15036.59s -> 15043.54s]  look at
[15043.54s -> 15047.70s]  Jurassic world tyrannosaurus rex. Jurassic world velociraptor mass
[15048.42s -> 15055.84s]  Can I just tell you something?

[15059.06s -> 15060.42s]  five stars
[15060.42s -> 15065.06s]  There are 519 ratings and this thing people love this shit
[15065.78s -> 15076.99s]  Look at those reviews
[15076.99s -> 15084.43s]  Why are there so many people getting the velociraptor one? The t-rex one has 10 reviews and the velociraptor one is 500
[15085.15s -> 15087.52s]  But what's with people don't want the t-rex one. Why?
[15088.24s -> 15092.14s]  Because it's a sans raptor
[15093.26s -> 15099.58s]  Okay, you and like 16 other people know what that is the people buying these toys don't care that this is a sans raptor
[15104.06s -> 15107.58s]  Why does everything have to be said? It's like and I see it too. Why is everything I
[15112.78s -> 15118.14s]  Hey reaper 500 thanks, but the 250 hey germ boy minister convinced chat to stop to shop
[15119.38s -> 15125.46s]  To stop asking you to show something if you use your germ powers to stop this

[15132.43s -> 15136.75s]  Uh, I i'm not gonna say the thing you want to be saying because that makes that means people will
[15137.63s -> 15139.63s]  Say it over and over again and never stop saying it
[15140.11s -> 15143.87s]  The more you talk about things like this the more the people go i'm gonna say let me say that
[15144.43s -> 15150.51s]  So, uh, no not blt. We're we've got we're over that already and I just said it. I just fucked it all up

[15171.92s -> 15173.92s]  And a sleeper agent for the dru crew
[15177.63s -> 15180.03s]  Uh, because I i've invested in the dru crew
[15181.09s -> 15183.57s]  I bought the fucking dru crew super pack
[15184.13s -> 15190.26s]  Which has like 35 games in it. I have a very vested interest
[15196.45s -> 15198.61s]  Play more of it then I know I buy
[15200.21s -> 15201.81s]  That's that's
[15201.81s -> 15207.25s]  That's like last resort streams. You have to you have to understand that's like
[15207.89s -> 15211.49s]  Oh, no, there is nothing left for me to do. That sounds bad
[15215.94s -> 15218.18s]  Those are great games to have when it's like
[15218.50s -> 15221.94s]  Oh the thing that we're doing turns out sucked or really wasn't fun at all
[15222.26s -> 15225.38s]  I have nothing else to do and I don't have any plan and I have nothing set up

[15240.45s -> 15243.41s]  Yeah, uh dru crew is not my first choice
[15244.13s -> 15247.25s]  For what I want to do on a day-to-day basis. It was
[15247.97s -> 15249.63s]  It was
[15249.63s -> 15253.38s]  I mean it was
[15253.46s -> 15255.46s]  Was it was
[15260.19s -> 15263.39s]  Those you yeah, you said you would marry them

[15315.10s -> 15318.72s]  I don't think there are any there's not very many anymore
[15319.52s -> 15326.98s]  I don't think there's very many wink thinkers. I think they never was very many wink thinkers to begin with
[15328.64s -> 15333.12s]  You had some bandwagon wink thinkers that kind of jumped off after links went away and
[15343.09s -> 15345.09s]  I can't even read that. You're fucking crazy
[15345.41s -> 15348.69s]  Hey morning maple. Thanks for the 250. Hey gerber before I forget
[15349.17s -> 15352.13s]  There's a game you can get on the pc and switch and think you enjoy called
[15353.58s -> 15355.26s]  pico nico
[15355.26s -> 15360.94s]  It's a short physics based puzzle exploration game. I think it'd be worth streaming because it could be beaten in just one stream or two
[15361.58s -> 15364.10s]  If you play your cards, right?
[15364.10s -> 15369.38s]  The humor can be a bit lol. So random and there's a cringy meme or two in there
[15369.38s -> 15384.29s]  But the gameplay is consistently fun is the trailer. Good luck with the boob lol. So random. Okay, i'll give this trailer 10 seconds

[15411.41s -> 15412.93s]  I don't want to show you guys
[15412.93s -> 15416.86s]  I don't want you to see I don't want to wait you you want to see what like a stream could be
[15417.18s -> 15421.34s]  I want you to be surprised
[15423.74s -> 15427.26s]  He's too lazy to put the browser source on and resize the window to youtube
[15427.82s -> 15435.18s]  He's a toxic streamer. I'm not a fucking toxic streamer. What the fuck are you talking about?
[15441.23s -> 15443.23s]  And finally we have uh 250
[15444.70s -> 15447.17s]  From jason. Thank you jason
[15447.17s -> 15449.65s]  Here's the person you're supposed to ban for life. I already did
[15454.66s -> 15459.86s]  This is uh, this is tar tar alec for they've been banned. They did they says but they said they said
[15460.42s -> 15462.35s]  Here's this and I quote
[15462.35s -> 15469.07s]  The odds that germa manages to move to a new house set up internet properly find the motivation to stream is less than zero percent
[15469.63s -> 15474.99s]  If germa streams a real stream next saturday, I give him permission to personally ban me for life
[15480.13s -> 15482.13s]  That's the right guy. Yeah, it is. It's the right guy
[15485.39s -> 15487.39s]  You didn't move though
[15487.55s -> 15490.43s]  I mean, I mean look i'm in the process of moving
[15490.99s -> 15494.35s]  That's why I had I took the last like four or five days off
[15496.93s -> 15498.45s]  It's a process
[15498.45s -> 15505.12s]  What do you mean it doesn't count you didn't move and didn't stream a full stream
[15506.62s -> 15507.84s]  um
[15507.84s -> 15511.84s]  Four hours. All right, four four and a half hours. That's a stream
[15512.56s -> 15516.24s]  If this was like two hours, okay, I'd understand if this is like
[15516.86s -> 15518.88s]  2016 two-hour stream germa sure
[15519.90s -> 15523.82s]  Four four and a half five that's four and a half. That's a stream. All right, that's a stream
[15523.98s -> 15532.94s]  He still didn't move I bet assumed you'd be in a new place and you're not
[15535.74s -> 15537.74s]  They're only banned for one day. It's okay. It'll
[15538.30s -> 15541.44s]  What constitutes yeah, what what constitutes a full stream
[15543.60s -> 15545.84s]  What when it when it what is it? What is a full stream?
[15546.56s -> 15548.00s]  It has to be
[15548.00s -> 15550.70s]  six hours
[15550.70s -> 15553.22s]  eight hours
[15553.22s -> 15561.25s]  At least six hours six to eight hours at least 24
[15562.29s -> 15564.29s]  Six minimum six minimum
[15564.69s -> 15566.62s]  minimum
[15566.62s -> 15572.46s]  Six to eight. Yeah, six to eight is all right. That's a full stream. Yeah. All right. We're doing small condensed ones
[15573.66s -> 15575.82s]  I typically do six to eight. All right
[15576.14s -> 15577.52s]  Okay
[15577.52s -> 15579.68s]  All right. Yeah, you got you. All right. I didn't sorry
[15579.68s -> 15584.16s]  I didn't know everybody every single person in chat here is tar alacran's fucking lawyer
[15585.87s -> 15599.86s]  The ban will be removed just doing my civic duty
[15604.78s -> 15610.54s]  Oh, you see my client said full stream and germa 985 a typical full stream from germa
[15610.54s -> 15614.86s]  985 is presumably anywhere between six and eight hours sometimes even longer than that your honor
[15615.42s -> 15620.94s]  And you tell me this man comes in on a saturday after not streaming for four or five straight days
[15622.37s -> 15625.25s]  And only turns the stream on for about four to five hours
[15626.24s -> 15632.32s]  And says specifically in the beginning of said stream that this is not a real stream that these are going to be shorter
[15632.72s -> 15638.10s]  Streams that are not going to be typical your honor. You should throw the book at him
[15639.54s -> 15642.22s]  not at my client at germa and
[15643.31s -> 15651.04s]  And it's not aim for his chest aim for his shoulder. All right, let me see if I get
[15653.22s -> 15656.80s]  Uh, all right missed completely
[15657.28s -> 15663.20s]  I mean, I mean I hit the wall like 40 feet away. I look I i've i've thrown a fucking ball in a long time
[15663.98s -> 15669.74s]  Mr. Albertson. Yeah, sorry. I was there was a noise 40 feet over here. I know
[15669.82s -> 15671.90s]  Yeah, well i'm trying to do something funny for somebody
[15672.46s -> 15676.94s]  Mr. Albertson, you are hereby named guilty for
[15678.20s -> 15680.20s]  banning
[15681.18s -> 15685.95s]  Let me see tar alacran for life
[15686.67s -> 15693.26s]  Uh, that ban will be removed will be reversed under the order of the court. Have a good day. I've made my decision
[15694.14s -> 15701.02s]  What what the fuck are you fucking what the fuck you're kidding me. Oh, oh the fuck man. No, no
[15701.26s -> 15723.47s]  What the we all leave the courtroom. What was the other guy's name? They've both been on bed
[15727.42s -> 15729.02s]  This is corruption
[15729.02s -> 15730.86s]  Move no move
