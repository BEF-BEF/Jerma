[1.40s -> 16.47s]  We're gonna, I'm gonna open Viscera. Viscera got a new level. Really? Okay, so, uh,
[17.19s -> 23.06s]  Amid Evil, we are probably gonna, we're gonna stop here from Amid Evil. We're gonna move on
[23.06s -> 28.63s]  to Viscera Cleanup, but I like this game. You will probably end up seeing this game again.
[30.15s -> 34.65s]  Nah, Viscera, um, Viscera's pretty fun, but I don't think, I fucked it up. I said the wrong game.
[34.65s -> 40.84s]  I was trying to do like, nevermind, fuck it, I just said the wrong thing. I was gonna say, like,
[40.84s -> 43.88s]  it's, like, pretend it's been like two weeks, and like, I'm never playing this game again.
[44.44s -> 58.89s]  I said the wrong game. Just pretend like I made something funny happen. I was trying to get the
[58.89s -> 66.18s]  music queued up, too. Oh well. All right, we're gonna play Viscera Cleanup Detail. Merry Christmas,
[66.18s -> 82.02s]  everybody. What, what's the new level called? I already did the Christmas level. Do I even
[82.02s -> 101.08s]  have this game installed? I do. Is it just on the base, Viscera Cleanup Detail? Or is, do I have to
[101.08s -> 104.68s]  buy it? Do I actually have to buy it? What's it called? Here, just put the BRB on for you.
[105.32s -> 125.69s]  Is it, it's like DLC? Oh, okay. Would it be on a DLC? House of Horror the Vulcan Affair.
[126.41s -> 137.99s]  I've already, I've done this. Is it a separate video game, not DLC?
[142.42s -> 148.36s]  Is it not called Visceral Cubes? Have you done the Vulcan Affair? I don't even remember.
[150.84s -> 165.13s]  Have I? What is the Vulcan Affair? They're just debating you. All right, well, fuck it,
[165.13s -> 173.11s]  we'll just open up, we'll open up one of them. I'm the god of so excited for the stream.
[174.44s -> 192.63s]  Uh, I don't think I've done the Vulcan Affair. How big is this one? It's spy themed? This is the
[192.63s -> 203.14s]  newest one. All right, well, fuck it, whatever, I'll try it. Your account already owns this game.
[203.86s -> 225.40s]  Oh, how? What? I don't have it listed here. I don't own this. You already own this game.
[228.42s -> 240.41s]  What? It's not in my library. Viscera Cleanup Detail, Santa's Rampage, and then Shadow Warrior.
[240.41s -> 261.90s]  I don't have this. It's just DLC on the base game. Let's just open it. Should I launch 64-bit or
[261.90s -> 275.80s]  play, just play it normally? I haven't played this in a long time. I don't remember. All right,
[275.80s -> 286.06s]  let's go. Hey, and the title doesn't even need to change. That could, that still makes sense.
[286.06s -> 311.85s]  All right, hold on. Switch game, DLC. The Vulcan Affair. I don't even own this. All right, hold on.
[311.85s -> 319.21s]  Wait, wait, wait, FOV 90, windowed mode. Nope. 1920 by 1080, windowed mode, turn it off.
[320.01s -> 329.53s]  Okay, gamma, 0.75, FOV 90, view bob, get it out of here. Dynamic shadows, sure.
[329.53s -> 337.99s]  Environmental shadows, I guess. Sure, motion blur, get it out of here. Bloom, who wants that?
[337.99s -> 345.67s]  Light shafts, nobody wants those either. Anti-aliasing, times two. Antroscopic filtering,
[345.67s -> 359.30s]  four. Ambient occlusion, get that out of here. It's ugly. Expensive particles, sure. Okay. Oh,
[359.30s -> 376.92s]  I think it crashed. Did it? Yeah. Too many expensive particles. I don't know where to get it. Hold on.
[376.92s -> 387.05s]  All right, there it is. Start assignment. It's a little, it's kind of loud.
[387.05s -> 393.85s]  Audio, sound, master down to 50, effects, music, ambient, that's whatever, that's fine.
[394.81s -> 408.63s]  Start. I would like to play solo. Save file, game type, clean up, work site, the Vulcan Affair,
[409.11s -> 416.98s]  okay. Game rules, I know how this works. Disable the sniffer, time limit, footprint limit, unlimited,
[416.98s -> 425.45s]  that's fine. All right, let's go, let's go, let's go. Am I going to be in the YouTube rewind? No.
[426.01s -> 433.54s]  Why would I be in the YouTube rewind? Okay, company vids you welcome to this
[433.54s -> 440.30s]  dump or whatever, right? It's a, oh, wait, wait, wait. Your mission, should you choose to accept it?
[440.30s -> 443.98s]  Well, you have no choice but to accept it or face severe disciplinary measures, understood.
[443.98s -> 448.14s]  Now then, this sprawling facility and various accessible areas are to be rendered clean and
[449.18s -> 453.90s]  rehabitable. As always, once decontaminated and cleared, you are to ignore and forget any details
[453.90s -> 458.06s]  regarding the incident. The multitude of nations that may or may not be connected with the events
[458.94s -> 462.70s]  would just clean up. Finally, considering the nature of the operations and work,
[462.70s -> 466.30s]  it's advisable to proceed with caution. Certain devices and systems may remain operable.
[467.98s -> 484.09s]  Well, that's a 10 million DPI. Okay, all right, so those of you who don't know how to play Vista
[484.09s -> 495.96s]  Cleanup Detail, it goes like this, and then you clean up stuff. I need to remember how to play.
[495.96s -> 504.52s]  All right, I need to track down a few things here. What's the, what room do I want to go to first?
[505.32s -> 513.35s]  Oh, right, put on music. This is new music, right? That's going to get my entire channel deleted.
[516.28s -> 531.45s]  No, that was, oh, that was all right. It's too loud, though. All right, so I need to find, where's the
[531.45s -> 538.86s]  broom? All right, this is a guy. Pick him up with the incinerator. Find the incinerator first. That's
[538.86s -> 550.49s]  most important. Okay, okay, okay. What's this? Warehousing. This shit don't work. What's this?
[550.49s -> 554.57s]  What's this? No, this is the particle exploder.
[555.61s -> 572.34s]  Oops. Uh, these are flares. It's a better broom. Now, that's where I put the USB drives.
[575.86s -> 598.68s]  Cool. So, where is the darks in here? Shit, this is so far away. Where's the incinerator?
[602.02s -> 610.36s]  Oh, god, this place is huge. All right, so this is where you get the buckets.
[615.11s -> 633.85s]  That's locked. Does this work? First floor. What about the sharks? Hold on. Oh, that's easy.
[639.48s -> 654.70s]  All right, wait, is this where you throw stuff away? Did they eat anything? Okay, did that,
[656.34s -> 682.66s]  okay, cool. Wait, I don't want to walk. What's in here? All right, let me, um, okay, I need a
[682.66s -> 692.41s]  buckets and shit. Buckets, buckets, buckets, buckets, and all right. Dude, Dr. Evil OST.
[694.07s -> 712.46s]  There is no, Dr. Evil OST. Is that even what you said? No, you said Dr. Phil OST. Right, okay.
[717.18s -> 731.53s]  That music sucks. I need my trash bag. Give me my trash bag. There it is.
[740.22s -> 751.51s]  Now, people get mad if I break this. Okay, we got some trash over here from the Home Depot OST.
[760.14s -> 774.97s]  I'm desperately trying to grab this. Isn't there a way to grab this a different way?
[776.25s -> 803.96s]  Depot theme. Hurry up. Home Depot theme. Now, I'll get you guys talking about the trash.
[804.60s -> 822.68s]  Very cool. All right, give me the mop. Do guns work? That'd be cool if they did. No. Okay,
[822.68s -> 833.43s]  just get rid of everything. Will they delete everything? So they can't be killed.
[835.59s -> 850.12s]  They're not gonna die, right? I need to clean that. I'll be up here, right?
[852.62s -> 868.54s]  One room at a time. This room first. I gotta bring, um, I need to fucking memorize where the
[869.50s -> 893.70s]  water comes out from. Give me this one. Go two at a time. Okay. When's he gonna do it?
[893.70s -> 897.94s]  When's he gonna do it? When's he gonna spill it? Here comes the first spill.
[900.26s -> 906.54s]  Fighting my tongue. I can't believe he's gonna do it. All right, corner to corner. Let's go.
[907.34s -> 925.34s]  What's over here that's dirty? This place is a clean. This is a clean. There it is. You got
[925.34s -> 938.20s]  what you wanted. You got what you wanted. There it is. You got it. Done. I did it.
[939.00s -> 957.74s]  Congratulations, everybody. Job well done, all of you. Okay, now next game. That's what I wanted.
[957.74s -> 974.36s]  All right, next. Next, do next thing. This one doesn't feel as messy as the other ones.
[974.36s -> 979.56s]  It just seems a little, it just seems bigger. Am I missing? Do I have to go down floors and shit?
[979.56s -> 990.54s]  Oh, that's gonna be hell. Let's put all the trash over here.
[990.54s -> 997.18s]  Fill joke has been filled. Time for the next game.
[998.30s -> 1021.96s]  Great. No, this is where we're staying and this is where we're ending. Play Dark Souls 3. I already
[1021.96s -> 1053.69s]  did. A lot. What qualifies as trash? Is that chair trash? Four game stream. I've never done that
[1053.69s -> 1062.60s]  before. What's the most games that you've seen on stream in one stream? Three? Two? Probably two or
[1062.60s -> 1074.46s]  three. Three, yeah. Go in the water. Why would I go in the water? That's death.
[1075.82s -> 1099.61s]  Isn't that gonna kill me? Yeah, no, this chair is junk. Look at this thing. Get rid of it. Why is
[1099.61s -> 1126.74s]  it still there? Good. Nice work. Nice work. Dr. Revo Lo St. Anything important? Trash. What's the
[1126.74s -> 1142.28s]  dirtiest level in this whole game? Anybody know? What's like the bloodiest, dirtiest level? How did
[1142.28s -> 1147.56s]  I knock that over? I wasn't even near it. Like, honestly, next level spill joke. I wasn't even
[1147.56s -> 1167.54s]  there. It fell behind me. How do you flip things around quickly? R? E? T? How do you do it? There's
[1167.54s -> 1192.07s]  nothing in water in it. Trash. Okay, how are we looking? Not bad. I gotta make sure it's all done
[1192.87s -> 1205.54s]  before moving on. No, I'm not doing face cam. There's no reason for face cam.
[1207.16s -> 1224.57s]  No, you know, I'm not doing it. No, I refuse. No, no, no. Eat that guy. Bring my trash receptacle
[1224.57s -> 1240.41s]  over here, please. One by one. I wish that... Can I just sweep these into the... Can I do that?
[1241.59s -> 1257.00s]  Can I do that? Yes, I can. That's it. I'm just painting. No, that's... Just do it. Just do it.
[1257.88s -> 1282.39s]  What do we got? This thing is filthy. Is it time to dump? Just very soon here it will be.
[1283.27s -> 1303.72s]  Time to dump, yeah. Yeah, it's time to dump. There's too much shit in here.
[1318.49s -> 1335.56s]  Good. Dumping. I know. I'm gonna mop it all up later. I should have done this first.
[1335.56s -> 1357.64s]  Face cam fortress. That's an old one. Are these open? I don't think they are.
[1360.54s -> 1379.03s]  Should you store your teeth? No, no, I don't like my teeth lately. Not lately.
[1387.11s -> 1392.71s]  That means they're clean, but they're not... They're not sparkling clean, and I don't like that.
[1393.67s -> 1399.45s]  I have to go back. I gotta get a cleaning or something. I think they're green. They're like
[1399.45s -> 1406.39s]  dark green. They're a clean green, but they're not... They're not like sparkling white, you know?
[1407.59s -> 1421.34s]  Yeah. How long has it been since what? How long since what been? All right,
[1421.34s -> 1423.34s]  now let's get the mop in here because everything's cleared out, right?
[1424.06s -> 1441.02s]  Nothing else on the ground, right? I don't care about this. Dr. Moreau. Oh, okay. Somebody
[1441.02s -> 1447.59s]  screenshot that and read it later. These are both locked. Can I just pick up the whole thing?
[1448.15s -> 1456.09s]  Here, watch ready. That didn't work the way that I wanted it to, but what if we're throwing this
[1456.09s -> 1472.50s]  away anyway? Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Almost there. Looks all right. Bring a couple buckets.
[1475.45s -> 1493.88s]  Can I dunk my feet in there if I step in anything? I didn't fuck this up last time, so...
[1494.84s -> 1531.37s]  Baldi's Basics? I've never even played that game and I know what that is. How do I know that? Why do
[1531.37s -> 1549.83s]  I know that? I've never even seen anybody play that game. Why do I know that? It's only because of the
[1551.91s -> 1566.46s]  in this song. That's what I'm thinking about that. All right, we're almost done. This fucking level
[1566.46s -> 1599.93s]  was easy. Fuck. No, it's the FOV. It's not balling up. Whatever. Easy. Yeah, there's this up there.
[1602.25s -> 1607.13s]  Why do I know this? I shouldn't know this. I've never fucking played this and I've never seen it.
[1607.13s -> 1615.85s]  I've seen the intro screen. What? I know this. Did I play this in my sleep?
[1616.81s -> 1639.67s]  And there's another character that goes like, hey, I... Did I? No, I didn't. I did not stream this game.
[1639.67s -> 1656.95s]  No, I did not. Give me a clip. I don't believe you. No fucking way. You did. No, I didn't. I know I
[1656.95s -> 1686.70s]  did not. Okay, just bring them. Wake up. I don't want to wake up. I want to stay here. So, this is
[1686.78s -> 1700.26s]  just part one of like 10, right? In this level. Look at the clip. Nobody linked anything.
[1702.28s -> 1712.63s]  I'm getting... I'm getting gaslit by my own community. I know I didn't play it.
[1713.43s -> 1726.74s]  Why'd you leave the keys on the table? You made the video. What the fuck are you talking about?
[1726.74s -> 1734.90s]  Hold on. Wait, I need to save this because what if it breaks? Oh, shit. Look it. I have stuff.
[1737.56s -> 1754.84s]  Five and a half hours? What is this? I made this video. I'm going to play the whole song.
[1755.56s -> 1777.18s]  No, I'm not. I don't want to. I don't want to listen to that. I mean, it's a great song. It
[1777.18s -> 1790.90s]  just is. But I don't want to play the whole thing. And that just messed up my framerate. Sing the
[1790.90s -> 1832.92s]  lyrics. I need water. Oh, I keep thinking. That stream was fucking ridiculous.
[1835.91s -> 1841.56s]  I wake up screaming sometimes because of that stream.
[1842.52s -> 1880.55s]  No, no, it's not real. Oh, it was. That stream killed me. Me too. All right. Only a couple more
[1880.55s -> 1888.07s]  pieces of fresh. And that's it. And I beat it. It was pretty cool. It's pretty good level.
[1890.55s -> 1900.92s]  Nice and clean. I have some cigarettes. Looks good. Looks good. This one looks good.
[1900.92s -> 1930.81s]  Good. Good. Good. It's a dirty monitor. Get in there. This is the longest YouTube video.
[1930.81s -> 1949.90s]  What do you mean? What are you talking about? YouTube video? Monitor lizard? I don't know
[1949.90s -> 1965.98s]  you guys talking about an S tier animal. S tier, yeah. Monitor lizard is an S tier animal. We
[1965.98s -> 1980.49s]  already know that. I've already done the tier list. All right. Is this clean? It sure is.
[1981.29s -> 2029.72s]  All right. What's wrong? What's today's date? Uh, December 3rd. See, I do know some things.
[2032.30s -> 2048.63s]  Cheating view the scanner. Part of the game. This looks pretty good. I would call this clean.
[2050.31s -> 2057.14s]  Would you? I didn't have to put a cheat code in to get this into the game. Wait, there's something
[2057.14s -> 2089.58s]  else here. Where is it? Bucket. Maybe it is the bucket. Is it? Is it? No, it's not the bucket.
[2089.58s -> 2108.50s]  Look right here. Oh, well you can't clean them all. That room's done. Is it above?
[2109.62s -> 2119.58s]  I don't see anything above. All right. The bucket's out of here. It was the bucket. Yeah.
[2120.46s -> 2134.04s]  We're good. Room clean. Don't spill. Okay. Now let's just get rid of this.
[2134.36s -> 2141.14s]  How are we looking over here? This room is pretty normal. There's an elevator to go down.
[2141.86s -> 2146.57s]  There's an elevator to go down. There's an elevator to go down. That runs off the tongue.
[2146.57s -> 2161.29s]  Really fun. Should I go down? Let me check these other floors. All right. Current floor.
[2162.17s -> 2175.51s]  One, two. Let's go take a look. Let's go to two. Am I on two?
[2175.99s -> 2203.61s]  Am I on two? Let's go down. Not there. This isn't even that messy though. That's not that messy.
[2210.95s -> 2233.77s]  What is this? Is it? Is my? Is this massage chairs? Am I activating their massage chairs?
[2234.65s -> 2269.64s]  Okay, it's dropping. Oh yeah. All right. Cool. So just put all trash here.
[2269.72s -> 2287.05s]  Jump in. Nope. I'm testing the theory. See where it goes. It goes. It's going into the
[2288.97s -> 2304.04s]  shark pit. I know where it's going. I can put them in there. I have one of those squares too.
[2307.03s -> 2313.93s]  Yeah, I don't even. Just get all trash ready. They have to be in the gray squares. Whatever.
[2313.93s -> 2328.57s]  It's okay. I'll do it in a minute. Just get it on a square. Coffee cup. Just get it on a square.
[2329.05s -> 2351.61s]  Hats and shit. Just throw it away. Good. Wait, is this chair of music playing out of it?
[2352.49s -> 2366.92s]  That easy. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna push broom this stuff.
[2367.80s -> 2394.15s]  It's dirty. I know, but I'm gonna mop later. So it goes under the hole. That's not far enough.
[2395.19s -> 2416.92s]  Oh, it's a big brain, big brain place. Thank you. Big brain school. Nice.
[2417.08s -> 2435.54s]  Oh, these are going to have to be picked up individually. This is fine. Uh, drop this guy
[2435.54s -> 2445.13s]  down. See you. I want to watch though. All right. This is starting to look all right. Just need to
[2445.13s -> 2470.94s]  mop eventually. I got a broom. Wait, hold on. This one does jump. Please. I am.
[2475.85s -> 2478.65s]  This one does jump. Please. I am.
[2492.97s -> 2507.99s]  Oh, hello. It's me Baldy. I am restoring Valia. I don't, I didn't play it. I don't fucking know why.
[2538.55s -> 2545.38s]  All these basics. I started with hand simulator and you guys told me I can't believe you're
[2545.38s -> 2551.54s]  playing the YouTuber game, but for some reason you'd like me to play all these basics.
[2553.72s -> 2571.86s]  I want you to say that into the mirror. I'm pretty cleansed.
[2574.02s -> 2585.18s]  I like how the trash receptacles are just really right here. This is great.
[2586.14s -> 2594.71s]  We got it. All right. Now I need to get, uh, some water up here. Where's this music coming from?
[2595.59s -> 2638.14s]  Seriously. Use gun. You can't use gun. It's gonna be so much fun. It really is.
[2639.10s -> 2643.21s]  I would put this up there with like ocarina of time.
[2644.09s -> 2663.19s]  And you have to say ocarina of time. Otherwise your list is invalid. The best games ever made.
[2664.31s -> 2682.47s]  Am I ever going to play that monkey game again? No, no, I'm not.
[2683.75s -> 2690.44s]  No ancient. What's it called? Ancient ancestors. No, you will not see that game again.
[2691.00s -> 2694.62s]  I do. I do not think so.
[2697.43s -> 2706.94s]  I'm here. Uh, a lot of these random. I get that with a broom.
[2711.80s -> 2725.66s]  Drop them. I think I brought a bucket up here. Where the fuck does he live? It's four o'clock
[2725.66s -> 2732.82s]  in the morning. I live in the center of Pacific Ocean. I'm on it's currently on a submarine.
[2733.94s -> 2759.46s]  Where's the water? Water bucket. There it is. All right. We're going to work out,
[2760.34s -> 2768.76s]  bring the bucket in here. What are you dumb? We're on the sub cam.
[2770.20s -> 2780.14s]  You guys do realize that's the next step for IRL streaming, right? All right. Uh, we've,
[2780.94s -> 2788.62s]  we've been, I've been to every location on earth. Now I'm going to stream myself getting into a
[2788.62s -> 2803.43s]  space shuttle and going to the moon or Mars. I don't want to go to Mars. I'm going to stream
[2803.43s -> 2824.07s]  the whole journey. It did that in the sixties already. Yeah, but, but it wasn't,
[2824.07s -> 2841.11s]  but it wasn't my favorite streamer. So whatever. I got to go more buckets. I am on floor one.
[2851.90s -> 2854.14s]  I know you're going to hate me for this, but I'm going to bring like three up there.
[2858.36s -> 2862.04s]  Somebody's getting the chat. I can already read their comment is going to say in all capitals,
[2862.92s -> 2890.18s]  just fucking do it normally. God, I know I've already read it. I can see it already. See,
[2891.14s -> 2903.85s]  not a problem. Bounce there. I'll do it. Fuck it normally.
[2908.76s -> 2921.80s]  I keep, we're going to have to put our own OST on again. Oh, Paul, they space it.
[2925.30s -> 2982.30s]  Where am I? That's the whole song. That's the, I thought it was more longer than this.
[2990.90s -> 3001.66s]  Home Depot theme, the Home Depot theme song. You guys, this is real. Oh, it's this thing.
[3004.68s -> 3022.84s]  Let's save it. We're doing that's power. Home Depot. Now I know what you mean. This is all,
[3022.84s -> 3033.34s]  this song is too. It's like eight seconds. This song is six, not even one, two, three,
[3033.34s -> 3045.45s]  it's three seconds long. It's not even a song. It's just the end of the commercial after the
[3045.45s -> 3070.86s]  guy says it. It's so stupid. It's growing on you. You can't be copyrighted if it's only three
[3070.86s -> 3089.29s]  seconds long. Oh, it's because I'm hearing this music too. I can't, I can't fucking do this anymore.
[3091.14s -> 3097.72s]  This is actually terrible. I mean, it's fine for a like 15 second ad for the Superbowl,
[3097.72s -> 3132.81s]  but not right now. I have to stop this. Lowe's doesn't have one. That's unfortunate. How about
[3135.64s -> 3147.34s]  Allstate? How it's made. We've done that already. How about we need cleaning music. Music to clean
[3147.42s -> 3154.02s]  too. This doesn't have to be like a playlist. Catchy songs to clean your room. One hour of
[3154.02s -> 3191.02s]  cleaning music. Okay. Oh, so some like dumb teenager made that. Some teenager made that
[3191.74s -> 3200.38s]  and that's fine. It's cool. Let's see what they have on their playlist. Cool. What's next?
[3204.02s -> 3208.78s]  Okay. What's the next one?
[3211.16s -> 3225.30s]  We should start now. Wait, is this Coldplay? Okay. What's the next one? I think this is,
[3234.63s -> 3238.04s]  uh, this one doesn't have a list. What's the next one?
[3244.39s -> 3252.34s]  I guess the search. That one didn't have a song. And not a bad playlist. Some of those. I don't
[3252.34s -> 3270.02s]  know what any of these are actually. Why would I type this? I, like I said before,
[3270.02s -> 3275.78s]  this stream was an extra stream for the week. And I can, you can tell that I just typed in,
[3275.78s -> 3292.60s]  um, I typed in piano key mashing. Like I was going to put that on. Nobody's made a video.
[3292.60s -> 3303.02s]  I'm trying to find one. Okay. If you type in piano key mashing, nobody has like,
[3303.58s -> 3315.53s]  uh, why are you kidding me? How has nobody done this? This like 600 trillion videos on YouTube,
[3315.53s -> 3330.30s]  not one person made one. That's unbelievable to me. Hitting every key on piano. What is this?
[3330.30s -> 3346.33s]  Fast piano key hitting. I could do that faster. I know I can. This is the fastest in the world.
[3346.33s -> 3354.26s]  I can do faster than this. You guys know I can do that faster than this Guinness world record
[3354.26s -> 3366.25s]  fastest hitting the piano keys in a minute. I could beat this. No, I can't believe nobody
[3366.25s -> 3378.09s]  has a video where they just hit a bunch of keys and it's like a 15 minute long video. How you
[3378.09s -> 3402.94s]  guys got one? I found one. Did you actually find one? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3403.02s -> 3431.45s]  Funny. All right. Who gives a shit? Wait, no, that's not it. That's not whatever. I'm done.
[3432.01s -> 3450.94s]  Just give me something normal to play. This took five seconds to find. What did you type in? No.
[3450.94s -> 3474.82s]  Yeah. Oh, the stinky video. I'm not, I don't trust you guys ever again. What is this? I can't put on
[3474.82s -> 3504.84s]  like this music. This is the cartoon music. Okay. I'm done. I'm actually done. What I'm going for
[3504.84s -> 3515.10s]  this one. This would be best background music. That's all I need. This is just stress relief
[3515.10s -> 3537.43s]  music. Sounds good to me. I gotta like continue playing the video game guys. That's not even
[3537.43s -> 3560.36s]  trash. Oh, you're a video game streamer now. Yes. I don't know what happened there. I know
[3560.36s -> 3577.62s]  it's a push from it still. Like what happened? Drop it. The best thing is I can drop these
[3577.62s -> 3606.46s]  too, right? Yes, I can get rid of them. Just press every button for God sakes.
[3607.66s -> 3635.78s]  Am I walking this around? Still have one bucket. That's clean. This is the same music that you
[3635.78s -> 3657.06s]  played when you died. Is it? It is. Dude, I scrawled a long way. I scrawled pretty fucking
[3657.06s -> 3686.12s]  far. That's so stupid. This is the music I played when I died. Fuck me. God damn it.
[3686.76s -> 3722.82s]  Okay, I can do a little bit more. I can do a little bit more cleanup. I have to use the device,
[3722.82s -> 3746.47s]  the shooter. This one's unlocked. Well, this is a mess. This is a mess. Just break a world record
[3746.47s -> 3755.58s]  on stream. Do you know how hard that is to do? People train for months doing the same thing
[3755.58s -> 3759.02s]  every day. And you want me to break a world record that I don't even know what record I'm
[3759.02s -> 3774.49s]  going to break on stream. Just now. God, do it already.
[3830.87s -> 3839.94s]  5G noises. You want to play 5G noises? Fine. You guys are in trouble. You guys,
[3839.94s -> 3886.65s]  you guys are on restriction right now. Okay. This thing's actually called chilling and relaxing
[3887.21s -> 3895.59s]  to 60 cycle hump. 12 hours of power line, power line noise.
[3899.61s -> 3915.83s]  This is what I feel like. I feel like it feels like cell tower sounds. Do they actually make
[3915.83s -> 3936.23s]  sounds? No, I don't think they do. Let's keep going. Don't, don't, don't, don't let it go.
[3937.19s -> 3961.35s]  Okay. Bring this one over here. Cool. No, I'm not playing it. I'm not playing it. You're making
[3961.35s -> 3967.90s]  that up in your head. There's no, I don't have any video on right now. You're making it up.
[3968.62s -> 3981.67s]  It's you. It's you. You think you hear it, but it's not there. That's just the air conditioner
[3981.67s -> 4006.84s]  in this room. Okay. Let me Dr. Phil. Dr. Phil. Sorry. Maybe some other day. Let's get this over
[4006.84s -> 4039.67s]  here. Play background crowd noises. Like at a bar. How about, um, crowd noises? Yeah, that's fine.
[4049.94s -> 4064.87s]  Internet cafe. That's right. This is not the same one though. Do a Twitch con panel?
[4065.83s -> 4093.85s]  You mean like right now? Yes. It's not Twitch con anymore. It hasn't been for a long time.
[4094.65s -> 4104.39s]  I need to dunk this in the water without knocking anything over.
[4105.19s -> 4115.62s]  Oh, fuck. Okay. Do a head start on next year's Twitch con panel. You're going to do
[4121.43s -> 4134.20s]  I'm not going to do a Twitch con panel. What the hell would I even tell you guys or anybody
[4143.18s -> 4153.11s]  dance? So if I, if I was on a Twitch con panel, what do you, what do Twitch con panels talk about?
[4154.07s -> 4174.12s]  I've never been to one. Weren't you there? I mean, I was at Twitch con. I never been to a
[4174.12s -> 4193.32s]  Twitch con panel. I had a Twitch con panel and I just had like a dummy on the stage and I was in
[4193.32s -> 4210.14s]  a doctor's outfit and I was just doing open heart surgery to the dummy. And the, the name of the
[4210.14s -> 4218.39s]  panel would be, I made a mistake, but I have to do this anyways. You know, I made a scheduling
[4218.39s -> 4226.14s]  mistake, but, but this guy needs a new heart. You know what I mean? So that's what I'm doing.
[4226.86s -> 4244.57s]  I just have like 10 people all in scrubs, just like openly are these operating and then randomly
[4244.57s -> 4252.34s]  answer Q and A questions about Twitch. That just, you know, like the people come up with a
[4252.34s -> 4264.30s]  microphone. So how did you get your start? Uh, on Twitch? Well, uh, hold on just a second. Yep. I
[4264.30s -> 4272.17s]  need a, can we close that one please? See that up. Yep. Thank you. Well, I, uh, I funny thing,
[4272.17s -> 4287.02s]  I played team fortress too. And I made comedy video. You have to do that now. I, do you don't,
[4287.02s -> 4289.82s]  do you think that they're going, I would ever be allowed to do something like that?
[4293.80s -> 4301.75s]  That's the type of scenario where you tell somebody that idea and then they go, oh, yeah. Whoa. Super,
[4301.75s -> 4308.87s]  super cool. Interesting idea. Let me, uh, let me throw some lines out and yeah, cool though.
[4309.43s -> 4315.91s]  Cool idea. And then they, you don't, they never talk to you again. That's how that works.
[4316.63s -> 4336.68s]  Those aren't Twitch panels reserved for, but do you have to actually talk about something?
[4337.72s -> 4343.27s]  I feel like they wouldn't want me just to make a mockery of Twitch panels, right? I don't think
[4343.27s -> 4361.77s]  they would want, I don't think they would want me to do that. Oh, just, just copy, just copy pen
[4361.77s -> 4367.37s]  and teller. And I have a panel where it's, what's the name of their show? Like fool us.
[4368.17s -> 4373.67s]  And I get up there and I'm like, welcome to a magician. I just bring like magicians on to like
[4373.67s -> 4397.61s]  fool me. I have to try to figure out what they did. Yeah. They filmed that show in Vegas and bring
[4397.61s -> 4405.45s]  in a, just bring in a bunch of really expensive looking fake cameras and hire 10 people to be
[4405.53s -> 4409.53s]  fake production staff. Like this is a real show that's on television, but all the cameras aren't
[4409.53s -> 4419.96s]  even real. Like it's, it's nothing about it is real at all. People are going to come into the,
[4419.96s -> 4422.36s]  into the panel, into the hall and they're going to look around and be like, holy shit,
[4422.36s -> 4427.24s]  there's like fucking 10 cameras. There's like a guy on a crane that he's sitting like Steven
[4427.24s -> 4431.98s]  Spielberg style sitting in the crane camera seat. The camera is made out of plastic. It's not real.
[4445.50s -> 4450.62s]  Crane is also plastic. Well, I think that would be kind of dangerous. So that would not be the case.
[4455.32s -> 4462.68s]  And have 250 actors be the audience and have one person actually in there that signed up for the
[4462.68s -> 4478.18s]  panel. And people are like treating it like it's a real thing. You know, actually would be kind of
[4478.18s -> 4487.13s]  funny is to have a panel, but to actually do that. I have a bunch of people that are hired to be
[4487.13s -> 4493.05s]  there to just talk you up and say how awesome you are and ask a bunch of questions and then
[4493.05s -> 4497.85s]  never really talk about it. But like somehow it comes out that those were all fake paid people
[4497.85s -> 4513.69s]  to be there. I would just look so bad and so fucked up. I would, it would just look really awful.
[4514.49s -> 4532.41s]  That's impractical jokers type shit. Yeah. Do a Reddit AMA. I do a Reddit AMA, but it's not even
[4532.41s -> 4540.22s]  me doing the AMA. It's not even me. And like halfway or like 75% of the way through that AMA,
[4540.22s -> 4549.67s]  my channel goes live and I'm sleeping in my bed. And then the stream turns off after like
[4549.67s -> 4569.58s]  two to three minutes. Nope, that ain't me talking. Two to three hours? Oh, I don't think I could do
[4569.58s -> 4580.28s]  that. Or have an AMA, but have like 10 accounts pretending to be me. One of them is the real one
[4580.28s -> 4586.30s]  and we're all answering questions. One of those accounts is real, but you don't know which one.
[4596.84s -> 4604.22s]  Everything looks good, except for this window that needs to be broken. Never mind.
[4605.18s -> 4623.06s]  That's the EQ stream, but in reverse. I would call this room clean except for this one.
[4623.94s -> 4636.57s]  There might be a couple of, uh, oh wait. Nope. Nevermind. I gotta get rid of all these bullet
[4636.57s -> 4663.61s]  holes. Here comes spade tornado. Oh, progress is being, uh, progress is being made on the
[4664.17s -> 4668.65s]  Minecraft stream by the way. That still should be, should be good to go for the 15th.
[4668.65s -> 4676.65s]  I mean, depending on how long it takes the, uh, the devs to put it all together,
[4678.14s -> 4683.50s]  I will have a better answer soon, but looking like it's going to happen. It will, this will
[4683.50s -> 4692.60s]  probably happen at least in December, but we're still shooting for the 15th. So that should be
[4692.60s -> 4700.07s]  fun. No, no, no, no. Not like the actual devs of Minecraft, like the people that are making
[4700.63s -> 4705.03s]  the server for all this to go down and all the plugins and everything.
[4706.55s -> 4728.68s]  Get them all in one go, get them all in one go, get them all in one go. Come on, do it.
[4733.70s -> 4760.23s]  I left one behind. Leaving one behind is fine. Leaving 12 behind is not. Hey, that's me. Who?
[4760.87s -> 4780.98s]  Me. All right, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it. This is going to be the worst room in real
[4780.98s -> 4796.44s]  life. Yeah, it's made out of strands of hair. All right, that's good enough for now. Make a joke.
[4797.16s -> 4818.73s]  What are you talking about? Make a joke. I'm not a woody doll. You pull the back, you pull my string
[4818.73s -> 4840.98s]  and I just say something. There's buttons under here. I want to press them. How do I press these
[4840.98s -> 4865.30s]  buttons? How do you crouch? What does that do? What the hell does that do? Shit, 5G dude, 5G.
[4874.92s -> 4929.03s]  Are you ready for 5G? Which one is this? This one? Okay, it's that one. Press it, press this button.
[4934.52s -> 4952.68s]  I can't press this now? This only works one time. Are you kidding me? Crouch, control, C, space,
[4953.64s -> 4970.30s]  caps lock, shift. What is crouch? Control, C, V, F, C, control. There is no crouch.
[4981.50s -> 4985.34s]  In the evening, in the event of my escape, I will bring Puddlesworth with me. I expect all of you
[4985.34s -> 5015.26s]  to attend to his requirements. You left your ring. That's a big ass ring. Caution. Caution. Submarine.
[5015.26s -> 5044.81s]  See, I told you I live here. Did you get out? It's clean. Re-chat, re-chat, re-chat. It's a collar.
[5044.81s -> 5059.93s]  Yeah, I know. Look, here's the cat right there. There. See?
[5093.98s -> 5100.65s]  Get on there. Fucking thing's not fucking working. Fucking stupid, fucking dumb,
[5100.65s -> 5115.51s]  fucking dumb, fucking stupid, fucking thing. This room is clean. Take a look. It's like nothing
[5115.51s -> 5128.28s]  ever happened in here except for these two blood stains. Pick them up. Fine. The bullet holes.
[5128.92s -> 5161.70s]  D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d. I know. Remember dead bodies up here? New viewer here. This guy's pretty cool.
[5162.90s -> 5174.63s]  Hey, thanks. Welcome. Welcome to the channel. How come there's no Twitch preview for when
[5174.63s -> 5179.83s]  somebody's new? Instead of a pre-roll ad, if you've never clicked on this channel before,
[5180.47s -> 5184.39s]  instead of a 30-second pre-roll ad, why don't you get like a, hey, my name's German on A5.
[5185.35s -> 5188.55s]  Welcome to the channel. And like a cut-up of a highlight and stuff.
[5201.08s -> 5205.40s]  Crazy things happen here all the time. 5G! The 5G, it hurts!
[5206.52s -> 5212.20s]  But I also do real talks. And then it cuts to another one. And I'm talking about like real shit.
[5213.40s -> 5236.62s]  I also, I also have a hernia. Why would I put that in my trailer?
[5237.34s -> 5244.34s]  Just in case you didn't know, I have a hernia. Okay. All right. What, why do I have to know that?
[5244.90s -> 5271.75s]  Oh, my rib cage is all fucked up. Just let it vent, chat. That is the lore.
[5278.10s -> 5283.38s]  I can't wait to, I don't even care if you guys don't want to see it. I'm going to make it in
[5283.38s -> 5303.32s]  front of the green screen channel trailer. And who remembers this one? Hi, German985 here. You
[5303.32s -> 5310.02s]  might know me as the Shpee Guy. Cut to like, Shpee, Shpee, like you've seen me say it like five times.
[5310.02s -> 5323.90s]  But I'm so much more than that. Just last week, I broke the world record. I'm the current world
[5323.90s -> 5332.81s]  record holder for clicking a single mouse button more times than anyone in five seconds. And then
[5332.81s -> 5337.21s]  I whip my hand up over my mouth to kind of lean in, whisper and be like, try to beat that one.
[5337.85s -> 5357.05s]  I'm also the only person that's slapped themselves in the face very hard, not on purpose.
[5363.03s -> 5370.95s]  In fact, it's probably, I'm probably more known for that than the carnival I did. And I'm going
[5370.95s -> 5396.97s]  to look right into the camera and be real fucking sad. All right. It's clean. We're good. And then
[5396.97s -> 5405.26s]  it's going to, the best part about if you could actually have that is I have to fucking,
[5409.21s -> 5416.04s]  don't make me do this. It's just make people think they're getting an ad on the stream.
[5416.04s -> 5421.53s]  Is that against term service? It's just in the middle of my stream, just fucking boom, play,
[5421.53s -> 5425.77s]  just like have a pretend like ad banner on it and like have a play over the video.
[5426.73s -> 5438.20s]  So it's like, you're actually getting an ad on my stream, but it's just, it's pumped in.
[5438.20s -> 5457.14s]  Imagine having an ad play on your stream. It's your own stream. And it's talking about,
[5458.39s -> 5461.75s]  Hey, you should like stick around. And it's like, it's like six minutes.
[5463.06s -> 5465.78s]  And then it cuts back and I don't fucking say anything. I'm just, I,
[5465.78s -> 5469.78s]  I, as if I continued playing where I left off, where I, you know, six minutes in the game has
[5469.78s -> 5478.18s]  gone by. Oh, you guys got an ad. All right. Hold onto that one. You might see it. All right. I'm
[5478.18s -> 5496.18s]  done up here. Everything's clean. You have this rocket ship. That's just a YouTube. Yeah. I know.
[5498.25s -> 5526.65s]  Press the button. This button. Press the button. All right. Next, next room. Wait,
[5526.65s -> 5529.53s]  Twitch staff is in here. What, who, who, who on Twitch staff is in here?
[5530.65s -> 5543.64s]  I should just make a bunch of fucking fake commercial shit. What was that?
[5544.44s -> 5550.81s]  Hey, commercials for like grills and shit that I, that I apparently am endorsing that I,
[5550.89s -> 5560.71s]  that aren't real staff is here because you said you were taking a dump on your desk.
[5569.50s -> 5571.18s]  Fuck. Oh,
[5583.83s -> 5590.95s]  like too much headquarters. You get, you get, you get a, a lead. It says, Hey, uh,
[5590.95s -> 5595.51s]  just made somebody stick around there for a while. This guy said he was going to take a dump on his
[5595.51s -> 5615.16s]  desk. You just sit in there with the stream open, just with your hand, I'll be mild, just like,
[5615.16s -> 5623.37s]  okay, what the fuck is this guy doing? Your hand is hovering over the like turn off stream.
[5628.81s -> 5631.53s]  Okay. What else do I have to do? Let's go. I gotta go up a floor.
[5635.48s -> 5655.94s]  Your ribs are breaking. Streamer, streamer removed from Twitch for threatening to take dump on desk.
[5656.42s -> 5660.89s]  Oh, that's fucking so stupid.
[5665.53s -> 5672.25s]  Career over. Please jump in the shark pit. All right, I'll do it for you. I'm going to do it for you.
[5672.89s -> 5700.94s]  My friend. It's me. I'm back. Ooh, good. I gotta go up a floor.
[5702.06s -> 5714.22s]  I'm going to get calls to the principal's office. Like a DM on like Twitter or something.
[5715.18s -> 5720.34s]  Did you Twitch staff Andrew or something? Hey, you got time to chat.
[5724.31s -> 5748.36s]  Uh, what's up? Hey, so, uh, we're going down. We're going to go three.
[5754.94s -> 5773.46s]  All right. This is not bad. Door control. Enter code. Now here's the really fun thing.
[5774.26s -> 5781.30s]  Not even fun. All right. So, oh, didn't DM from which staff? Oh, no, no. Oh, boy.
[5782.97s -> 5788.25s]  Hey, what's up? I'm sorry. I'm sorry about talking about shitting on my desk. I'll never happen again.
[5788.25s -> 5794.50s]  I promise that was really fucked up. Hey, dude, just want to say congratulations on your for your
[5794.50s -> 5820.95s]  partner. Right. Right. Okay. Thanks. But now that you said, what are you talking about?
[5823.06s -> 5828.82s]  Nothing. I didn't. Don't worry. I just, I'm, you know, Mr. Comedy Man. That's what I do.
[5829.46s -> 5834.66s]  Hold on. Somebody's linked me a clip. Oh, don't click that. It's probably a virus.
[5840.38s -> 5843.90s]  You know, it's not important. Just get them on the elevator. Who cares?
[5844.86s -> 5855.19s]  Who cares how they're on the elevator? Just get them in. Get another message back. Yeah,
[5855.19s -> 5865.35s]  I've reviewed this clip. I don't know what to say about this. Bring it all.
[5866.31s -> 5887.18s]  All of it. All of it. All of it. It's in here.
[5903.45s -> 5915.56s]  Uh, okay. Do I open these? Say it. Say what? What would you say if you were really,
[5915.56s -> 5920.60s]  really sort of tense and scared and there's a fucked up moment that's about maybe about to happen?
[5920.60s -> 5946.74s]  What would you say?
[5955.03s -> 5970.31s]  I'm just picking stuff up and moving it. Launch aborted. One second remaining. All right. I
[5970.31s -> 5975.51s]  can't do this yet. I need the code. What's the code? Just give it to me. I just want to tell
[5975.51s -> 6006.26s]  me what it is. I'll sit here all day. I don't care how long this takes. I'm waiting for someone to
[6006.26s -> 6051.30s]  put the real one in. Why would I ever think that would be real? I mean, it's been in the chat so
[6051.30s -> 6054.74s]  many times that how am I supposed to know that that's not how am I supposed to know that?
[6067.18s -> 6085.38s]  They are random. What makes a different sound? It was on the cat's collar. Thank you. Appreciate it.
[6087.37s -> 6112.46s]  Thank you. Where's the elevator? How do I get out of here? Am I stuck in here?
[6119.45s -> 6127.85s]  No, there it is. Right. I fucking barricaded myself. Where is it? Two
[6128.57s -> 6157.58s]  cats collar. This is not even right. Screen blinks green when you do a right number.
[6158.54s -> 6176.78s]  Oh, I'm already here. Let me see. Is it on the cat's collar? Mr. Cuddlesworth.
[6186.06s -> 6207.27s]  Right. Is it on the back? Oh, how is this not spilled? These two have not spilled.
[6208.31s -> 6213.91s]  That's almost impossible. I sneeze next to one of these and they break and they fall over.
[6213.91s -> 6241.53s]  It does a green. It blinks green. Wait. All right. Hold on. The second number is three.
[6244.04s -> 6262.47s]  Second number and fifth number are three. Third number is seven. Fourth number is seven.
[6265.10s -> 6277.53s]  Something. Wait, what? First number is eight. First number is eight. Three. No.
[6277.53s -> 6297.27s]  Eight. Three. Eight. Three. Seven. Eight. Three. Seven. Three. Nope. Eight. Three. Eight. Seven.
[6299.02s -> 6310.94s]  Three. Three. Eight. Seven. No, it's eight. Three. Seven. Seven. Eight. Three. Seven. Seven. Eight.
[6310.94s -> 6327.93s]  No. Eight. Three. Eight. Three. Seven. Seven. Three. Now what? Seven. What's on lock? What did I do?
[6329.29s -> 6362.10s]  Oh, shit. Can I launch this? Death Ray is ready. Fire the weapon in Yellowstone.
[6362.66s -> 6371.40s]  Okay. Where's the button to go? Fire the missile. How do you fire the missile?
[6372.36s -> 6393.40s]  Do I have to throw a match in here? Launch the missile. What do you think I'm trying to look for? A way to launch it.
[6394.92s -> 6407.59s]  Man. All the way from the ground floor. Okay. Well, I want to launch this shit. Let's go.
[6408.87s -> 6438.14s]  All right. It's locked. Where the hell am I? What is all I'm going to do? This map is huge.
[6439.77s -> 6441.77s]  There it is. All right. Here's the way to... How do I get this open?
[6447.34s -> 6467.19s]  German. I dot dot dot. What? Oh, no. All right. Two. Two is the first number.
[6468.31s -> 6482.06s]  This is... Holy shit. Do you see how long this code is? I have to write this down. Oh, my fucking
[6482.06s -> 6496.78s]  God. I gotta write it down. Two is the first number. Two. Four. No. There's four in here.
[6497.42s -> 6515.00s]  There's a backspace. Yeah. Two. One. Two. Four. Two. Three. Two. Five. Two. Six. Two. Seven. Eight. Two.
[6515.96s -> 6534.26s]  One. You know. Two. Three. Two. Eight. Three. Four. Five. Eight. Six. Seven. Nine. Zero. One. Two.
[6534.26s -> 6591.27s]  What? Three. Okay. Three. One. Okay. Almost. Okay. One more. Pay attention. I wasn't paying
[6591.27s -> 6593.99s]  attention. I wasn't paying attention. It's not what I want. I wasn't paying attention. What was
[6593.99s -> 6614.66s]  that number? Two. What? Two. Eight. Two. Eight. Three. Three. Five. Three. Guys, I don't... Two.
[6614.66s -> 6628.20s]  Eight. Three. Three. Five. Three. Seven. Nine. What's the last number? Six. Seven. Eight.
[6629.24s -> 6648.55s]  What's that? What's the last number? What's the last number? Four. Am I gonna miss the explosion?
[6650.84s -> 6676.02s]  Wait. Map. It's so big. This is a huge map. This is so big. I'm not gonna be... I'm not doing this
[6676.02s -> 6688.60s]  whole thing on stream. No. Nope. It's not gonna happen. You're not meant to do it in one day.
[6689.48s -> 6726.41s]  Yeah, I know. Frogman? Whoa. I'm interested. What's this? I would get so lost in here.
[6727.77s -> 6757.42s]  I already am. Giant laser? Holy shit. Okay. So there's two target acquired.
[6759.69s -> 6823.05s]  That's cool. Recharging. Wait. Can I move it around? I lived on the moon. I'm sorry.
[6824.41s -> 6854.15s]  I think I did it. You have 24 hours until it hits the earth. I'm supposed to be cleaning.
[6856.12s -> 6870.97s]  This is too expansive. It's too expansive. I want to launch this, though. How do I open this thing?
[6878.52s -> 6897.61s]  That's the wrong one. So it's this one. How do I get you open? There's gotta be a way to get this
[6897.61s -> 6920.92s]  open, right? This way? Baldi's waiting room. You're never going to see Baldi's basics on this stream.
[6922.20s -> 6936.15s]  I need to explain to you why. Can I just like... Wait a minute. What are the tools? A beacon.
[6936.95s -> 6954.25s]  Well, I don't think we can launch the thing because I don't know how to open the door.
[6955.21s -> 6968.38s]  You either play Doki Doki Literature Club or you play Baldi. There are no alternatives.
[6968.78s -> 6981.83s]  No. All right. Let's just pretend this is the room that I cleaned and this is the one that
[6982.79s -> 6997.72s]  is the one that matters right now. Look at how clean it is, right? I don't have the broom anymore.
[6998.52s -> 7004.33s]  All right. I have to take care of this. This is a lot of bullshit. I need to go back down to...
[7016.34s -> 7026.22s]  What was still needs to be cleaned up here? There's a whole spot over here. What is going
[7026.22s -> 7056.20s]  on? Yeah. This spot here. God damn it. I need buckets. Okay. Bucket and bring three.
[7057.24s -> 7068.14s]  I need to ascend. To where? I don't need to ascend. Jump in and out of the pool real quick.
[7069.10s -> 7101.96s]  I already did that. You missed it. I'm bored. Dual voice. Just give me a minute. I'm down.
[7102.12s -> 7116.57s]  Stream's over. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow. So tomorrow,
[7117.13s -> 7125.10s]  tomorrow, what is planned is Joel and I are going to be potentially... We're going to be starting
[7126.06s -> 7135.54s]  Halo Reach. We're going to do Halo Reach today, but we rescheduled for tomorrow.
[7136.10s -> 7141.93s]  And then I played Hand Simulator and everybody... If you weren't here earlier,
[7141.93s -> 7148.09s]  rewind to that part of the VOD. Everybody thought it was so fucking funny. So good.
[7149.05s -> 7155.78s]  They're not watering these. This is a razor.
[7165.27s -> 7172.36s]  Joel's going to ignore you and just play Baldi's Basics. Don't even kid.
[7180.95s -> 7187.99s]  But yeah, so I decided instead of just postponing streaming till tomorrow, we're going to... We
[7187.99s -> 7194.49s]  decided to play a triple game today. Stream is just an extra one. I'm going to go three
[7194.49s -> 7201.21s]  days in a row from here on out after this. I'm assuming Halo Reach will be maybe a full stream
[7201.21s -> 7206.87s]  or two. I don't know what the plans are. We'll see. And then we're going to play Tools Up.
[7207.59s -> 7211.43s]  We're going to see if we can get that to work with the second, third, fourth day.
[7211.43s -> 7215.90s]  Play Hand Simulator tomorrow. I already got what I wanted out of it.
[7216.30s -> 7224.02s]  But no more Hand Simulator. I already said it was the worst game of the decade.
[7224.02s -> 7231.14s]  And I kind of regret saying that because that's definitely not true. I know it's not true.
[7231.14s -> 7235.38s]  But I said it and I need to retract that statement because that's definitely not true.
[7245.58s -> 7257.24s]  Of the decade. All right. Yeah, I'll call... No, not yet. I want to clean this house.
[7270.15s -> 7279.74s]  Just... I want to do this part. I'm almost done. Well, okay. It's a base, not a house.
[7280.62s -> 7292.97s]  Why does this shit not work? Five more minutes, mom. Five more minutes. Five more minutes.
[7293.85s -> 7307.45s]  Oh, let's just bring them up there. Baldi, Baldi, Baldi. One day I will just turn on Baldi's Basics
[7307.45s -> 7315.40s]  and I'm not going to tell you when. It'll just happen one day. You'll just see it one day.
[7316.12s -> 7330.50s]  That's a lie. That's a lie. That's a lie. Can't be a lie if it hasn't happened yet.
[7331.30s -> 7338.46s]  All right. So if I told you that I was going to play Baldi's Basics and then
[7338.46s -> 7351.61s]  six years went by and I played it, is that a lie? No, I played it. I didn't say I was going to play
[7351.61s -> 7371.69s]  it tomorrow. Can I clean this in here? You actually can. Wow. Technically. Yeah. Halo
[7371.69s -> 7375.37s]  Reach should be fun. By the way, for those of you that don't know, I have never played
[7376.70s -> 7383.58s]  one solitary minute of Halo. I told you Halo 2 is the only one I've ever played
[7384.46s -> 7389.42s]  and I played the multiplayer across like four TVs once or twice in college.
[7392.12s -> 7401.34s]  I've never played one second of any of the campaigns. So we'll find out. That's not a lie.
[7402.14s -> 7410.26s]  That is not a lie. I've never played Halo. I mean, so I've lied. No, I never had an Xbox.
[7411.96s -> 7418.84s]  I didn't have a regular Xbox and I got an Xbox 360 late into the game and just didn't play them.
[7419.88s -> 7428.74s]  We played Halo 2. It's a multiplayer. Maybe for 45 seconds in two or three lives when I drove a
[7428.74s -> 7443.43s]  car into a wall and like threw a grenade at somebody. But okay, what constitutes playing
[7443.43s -> 7451.27s]  the game? Okay is. Oh, I played Halo 2, but I really didn't though. I can't even name you one
[7451.27s -> 7460.47s]  gun. I guess I physically pressed the button on it once and then I've watched somebody play for
[7460.47s -> 7474.07s]  15 minutes. So you played it. Yes. Physically I have sat in front of the screen and played
[7474.07s -> 7490.74s]  Halo 2 multiplayer for a minute or two minutes tops. So you played it. I guess I've played it.
[7501.03s -> 7517.85s]  Literally competitive Halo. I love how somebody's doing that joke for me right now and I didn't even
[7517.85s -> 7547.11s]  plan it. All right. All right. I'll see you guys later. I'm gonna call it here. This was a real
[7547.11s -> 7553.74s]  wild one. And Medieval is actually pretty fun. So you may actually see me complete that game.
[7553.74s -> 7560.46s]  You actually might because it was pretty fun. I did enjoy it. Thanks for watching the secret.
[7560.46s -> 7563.26s]  I don't even have a secret. I tweeted about it and I told everybody I streamed today.
[7563.66s -> 7566.46s]  Uh, thanks for the coming to the extra stream this week.
[7567.59s -> 7579.35s]  See you tomorrow for Halo Reach Cooperative Multiplayer Campaign with Joel. Thanks for
[7579.35s -> 7589.54s]  watching guys. You made a video on Halo. I'm not going to click another Rick roll. Jump in.
[7592.57s -> 7630.31s]  My computer crashed. I just have a bloody screen. Yeah, there's just blood on the screen.
[7638.01s -> 7645.00s]  All right. Actually, good night guys. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm looking forward to Halo. I've
[7645.00s -> 7651.42s]  heard a lot of things about Halo. I've heard, dude, Halo is, is just, it's like the best. You
[7651.42s -> 7664.44s]  have to play it. You're going to love it. I hope so. And when they all release, I'm going to be
[7664.44s -> 7668.68s]  playing all of them. I mean, I can't necessarily guarantee I'm going to co-op every single one of
[7668.68s -> 7683.86s]  them, but we'll see. Hey, Bob Boy. What's going on, Bob Boy? Thanks for the five subs. Richard
[7683.86s -> 7691.93s]  Nixon's still a top sub gifter. Thank you. But let's go back. Let's do the bits. I'll see you
[7691.93s -> 7698.98s]  guys tomorrow. Thanks for hanging out earlier, earlier, about six, what six hours ago. Yes.
[7700.78s -> 7710.31s]  Hey, uh, hey, turret hugger. Thanks for the 500 bits. That face when hernia. Poor Jeremy show
[7710.31s -> 7722.98s]  love. Appreciate it. Thank you. I'll be okay though. I'll be good to go. We'll continue to
[7722.98s -> 7732.52s]  work on it and see what happens. Appreciate it. Oh, so thank you to swiggity swanky for 250
[7732.52s -> 7741.38s]  bits. They say hand simulator. What is this? Let's find out. You ma'am, get your hands in there.
[7741.38s -> 7748.47s]  Like open this up and get your hands in there and just start feeling around. I want you, you. Oh,
[7748.47s -> 7754.89s]  wait, this is me talking about how I want, I told ma'am, get your hands. Yeah. Look at how old this
[7754.97s -> 7759.45s]  is. Get your hands in there and just start feeling around. I want you. All right. This is two years
[7759.45s -> 7764.49s]  ago. This is me describing what I wanted the doctor to do. I wanted to do exploratory surgery on me.
[7765.05s -> 7782.42s]  Yeah, that was, that was two years ago. Jesus. Time flies when you have a hernia. Thank you,
[7782.42s -> 7787.14s]  Zeke for the 250. Your streams have been a soundtrack to many long lonely nights of studying.
[7787.14s -> 7793.61s]  Cheers for that. Still waiting for the cooking stream. Hopefully it's worth the wait when you
[7793.61s -> 7800.49s]  see it eventually. We'll see. Hey, Jason, thanks for the 500 bits. Hey, German, today marks the
[7800.49s -> 7805.45s]  one year since I first started watching you. Today's also the same day since the green screen
[7805.45s -> 7809.61s]  movie night. Ever since then, I was hooked on your content and never missed a stream. Not only have
[7809.61s -> 7814.41s]  you helped me through so many tough times, but most importantly, you've helped us. Whether it's
[7814.41s -> 7820.09s]  being called short or saying, look at me, you never cease to make us laugh. I'm so grateful to
[7820.09s -> 7829.42s]  have discovered such a great guy. Keep on keeping on. Thank you. I really appreciate it, Jason.
[7832.98s -> 7844.58s]  I'm glad you stuck around. Hope you continue to do so. Thanks again. Hey, Marvish McGally,
[7844.58s -> 7848.10s]  thanks for the 250. I look forward to the stream with Joel, especially after we recently reacted
[7848.10s -> 7856.49s]  to rat movies on stream. Not sure if you saw that. It was quite wholesome. Yeah, we'll see. The one
[7856.49s -> 7864.10s]  thing I'm concerned about is ping tomorrow. We're going to have to see how the connection is from,
[7865.67s -> 7875.64s]  you know, across the world. Might be interesting. But yeah, that's, Joel's a funny guy.
[7876.28s -> 7886.74s]  Let's see how the stream is tomorrow. It's not, it won't be too bad. Let's hope so.
[7886.74s -> 7897.38s]  Because remember, I'm Pacific. So West Coast to, I wonder how far the travel time is. But thank you,
[7897.38s -> 7902.87s]  Marvish McGally. Appreciate it. Thank you, Gnarly, for the 250. My friend got me to play Hand
[7902.87s -> 7907.51s]  Simulator. I've never raged more at a game in my entire life. I've beaten every Soulsborne and I
[7907.51s -> 7913.35s]  actively play League of Legends and yet fucking Hand Meme Game is what breaks me. Fuck this game.
[7913.35s -> 7925.74s]  Fun stream. You know the thing about that game? I would have sat there until I got it. Until I got
[7925.74s -> 7935.91s]  it, I would have done it. But I had, I had to stop. I had to just pull the plug. Even if I wasn't
[7935.91s -> 7939.91s]  streaming, I would have sat there for like six hours trying to put the clip into the handgun.
[7939.91s -> 7950.97s]  I know I would have. You didn't though, you said it. I put it, I put the clip into the gun and I
[7950.97s -> 7956.87s]  fired the gun. I didn't, there's, I didn't shoot at anything. I didn't hit any targets.
[7957.83s -> 7972.82s]  That's okay. Thank you, Final Fantasy, for the 300 bits. They say nice. Thank you. Martin had
[7972.82s -> 7977.46s]  a meme. Thanks for the thousand bits. 10 bucks. Appreciate that. Jerma, you should have, you should
[7977.46s -> 7982.34s]  have just admitted to the gun range owner that this was your first time. Lying about your experience
[7982.34s -> 7988.98s]  is never right. Now you're gonna have to make up excuses like, I swear this doesn't usually happen.
[7988.98s -> 7998.50s]  I guess I'm just nervous. Thank you, Snarobosis, for the 10 community subs earlier. Don't think
[7998.50s -> 8004.74s]  we saw it. I think I was in the middle of doing a chill stream where I get very angry at a game
[8004.74s -> 8009.06s]  that I then call the worst game of the decade. Chilling out, just hanging out. Chill stream today.
[8009.94s -> 8015.45s]  Extra chill stream. Thank you though for the 10 community subs. Appreciate it.
[8015.45s -> 8025.54s]  And thank you, Martin had a meme again for the thousand bits. CAD, BTV. What's going on CAD?
[8026.87s -> 8033.35s]  A thousand bits here from CAD. What a game. It gives you a gun, makes you want to shoot yourself,
[8033.35s -> 8051.38s]  and then doesn't let you. All right, no. Hey, Jerma95 AMA. How's it going? I could get a large
[8051.38s -> 8056.66s]  number 10 with fries, please. No. Did you ever play Halo? When's the next Kenshi stream?
[8057.38s -> 8063.32s]  Kenshi was an incredible experience and I'd love to stream it again. However, when you do multiple
[8063.32s -> 8067.32s]  streams in a row like that, it can get pretty tiring. A lot of people in chat were tired of it
[8067.32s -> 8070.92s]  too, but seeing how warm of a response the videos on the second channel got, I'll probably play it
[8070.92s -> 8075.64s]  again at some point. It's supposed to be fun to return to it at some point. Just like I return
[8075.64s -> 8084.31s]  every Tuesday to get a $5 waffle meal at Burger King. What was that sketch you had 100% confidence
[8084.31s -> 8090.26s]  in that didn't execute as expected? The infamous slap myself in the face joke was supposed to end
[8090.26s -> 8095.30s]  with me turning around and leaving the room, with my arm whipping around, with my body turning to
[8095.30s -> 8100.02s]  follow, but I timed it wrong while looking at my second monitor. I suppose that went better than
[8100.02s -> 8104.98s]  expected, much like the $12 or 99 family bundle deal they have at Burger King. That's three
[8104.98s -> 8108.02s]  cheeseburgers, three small fries, and three waffles for under $13.
[8111.58s -> 8116.34s]  Thoughts on the new Crispy Pretzel Chicken Fries? Did Burger King Crispy Crunchy Pretzel outside
[8116.34s -> 8120.90s]  tender juicy white meat chicken inside new Crispy Pretzel Chicken Fries?
[8123.30s -> 8128.90s]  That stream was a mess. I don't condone the things I said while I was live. It was really
[8128.90s -> 8133.46s]  out of character. I don't think you'll be seeing me streaming with him again. Sorry. What?
[8134.42s -> 8141.45s]  Have you ever tried coffee marinated chicken stuffed with Cheetos before?
[8142.49s -> 8147.05s]  Oh, look at you. It's the same fucking coffee Cheetos chicken joke again. Well played. Look,
[8147.05s -> 8153.05s]  everyone. We have a fucking comedy genius over here. Jesus Christ, you subhuman. Okay.
[8153.05s -> 8161.80s]  Can't think of anything. This is not me. This is not me. This is me. This is somebody. This is me
[8161.80s -> 8167.85s]  pretending that this is somebody pretending to be me. Why are you a massive compulsive liar?
[8168.65s -> 8172.33s]  If you're looking to throw hands, I'd be willing to meet you at next year's
[8173.37s -> 8180.89s]  winner buys the other a $3 10 piece nugget. Okay. I can't. Okay. Oh my fucking God damn it.
[8184.42s -> 8206.30s]  All right. That's it. That's it. That's it. All right. Abort, abort, abort, abort, abort, abort.
[8206.30s -> 8215.11s]  I'm not, there's no AMAs going on. There's no AMAs going on. There's no AMAs.
[8227.64s -> 8260.49s]  It's your AMA. It's not my AMA. Why? This guy, this is a PR nightmare for me. Yes. This is going to
[8260.49s -> 8267.05s]  pop up like 10 times. I have no control over this. No, no. What? What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Wait,
[8267.05s -> 8273.29s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. A real AMA. You have to prove it's a real AMA. Don't,
[8273.29s -> 8276.49s]  I have to tweet out a picture of me holding up a sign that's pointing to it going like,
[8276.49s -> 8284.58s]  Reddit AMA. Uh, January 10th, 2020. Right? That's how you know it's real. So it doesn't matter.
[8295.91s -> 8305.53s]  Fucking damn it. Okay. Let's keep going. Let's keep going. PR nightmare.
[8312.10s -> 8326.20s]  Anyways, thank you. Really appreciate it. Large 27. Thanks for the 500 bits.
[8327.16s -> 8331.21s]  Dermot, please for the love of all that is holy, stop for your health and mine. I can't take it
[8331.21s -> 8336.17s]  anymore. I'm about to die and combust into a million pieces of dirt. Please stop. Oh my god,
[8336.17s -> 8346.90s]  stop. I was playing hand simulator and like, nobody liked it. Thanks. Hey, uh, hip moose. We
[8346.90s -> 8358.95s]  didn't see this five community subs from hip moose. Oh man. Thank you hip moose. Sad Vega,
[8358.95s -> 8362.47s]  thanks for 300 bits. I suffer from a condition where I get a lot of information and I suffer
[8362.47s -> 8366.95s]  from it year round. I take a thousand milligram capsules of turmeric to help manage it. It helps
[8366.95s -> 8371.91s]  a lot, but as a heads up, it's going to dehydrate the hell out of you, which means expect constipation
[8371.91s -> 8380.26s]  if you don't drink tons of H2O. Yeah. Uh, what's probably going to end up happening here is I'm
[8380.26s -> 8387.08s]  going to do, I'm going to do some, maybe try to do some supplements and stuff, but I'm probably
[8387.08s -> 8391.66s]  going to start to go see a physical therapist because I know that there are some things to help,
[8392.46s -> 8398.22s]  um, kind of unlock your joints a little bit, different stretches, different physical therapy
[8398.22s -> 8409.86s]  you can do to help with this issue. Cause like I said before, it really does feel like
[8411.08s -> 8417.64s]  I almost just need somebody to like press down and twist and then pull up and then twist and it'll
[8417.64s -> 8422.68s]  be like, and I'll go back to normal. But I know that, I mean, that's just kind of how it feels.
[8423.48s -> 8434.38s]  But even sometimes when I like, if I, if I lean back and I pull back a little, I can feel inside
[8434.38s -> 8453.14s]  of my chest around to my back, like it's like, so that's what I get for shoplifting. That's what
[8453.14s -> 8465.38s]  you get for stopping lifting. Oh, that's what you get for not lifting anymore. Well, it's actually
[8465.38s -> 8472.94s]  a very good thing. I don't like lift any weights anymore. So I'll probably do some physical therapy,
[8472.94s -> 8480.26s]  see if we can move some shit around, see if I can do some stretches, try to loosen up
[8481.22s -> 8484.74s]  these apparently inflamed joints. And yeah, I know that I've been told,
[8485.46s -> 8490.90s]  the doctor told me you might get like a shot of cortisone, cortisol, whatever steroid into the
[8490.90s -> 8496.18s]  bone, into your, that's not, that's not good for you though. I've heard that that's really not good
[8496.18s -> 8517.02s]  for you. We'll see what they say. I'd like to try physical therapy first. I've had that in my back
[8517.02s -> 8525.86s]  and it's the second worst pain I've ever felt. Damn it. Oh well. Is the pain in your back or
[8525.86s -> 8532.42s]  is it on your stomach? It's my whole entire core. So it starts right in the middle of my sternum,
[8532.42s -> 8539.30s]  right in my breastbone and then goes out inside that area around my ribs. And then it's all around
[8539.30s -> 8544.42s]  the back of my ribs too, my whole back. Mostly, most pain is on like the right side of my back
[8544.42s -> 8552.65s]  into the center of my chest. This has been about a year and a half of dealing with it.
[8553.45s -> 8556.06s]  And something that I didn't really talk that much about because it was just like,
[8556.06s -> 8558.30s]  ah, what is it? What would I, what is there even to talk about?
[8560.84s -> 8572.70s]  So it's just like a, just constant, just there always, but this last six months or so, I've
[8572.70s -> 8577.90s]  been really pushing hard, hard, hard, hammered hard to really try to figure out what the fuck
[8577.90s -> 8589.02s]  is even going on with my body. And I, over the last, yeah, like six, seven, eight months straight,
[8589.74s -> 8595.14s]  I've been trying to figure out what the fuck it is. And maybe one piece of that puzzle is the
[8595.14s -> 8600.84s]  hernia, which is what I had, that's what I have. But the doctor also says it's probably both.
[8601.72s -> 8623.64s]  His skeleton is hatching. But hey, we get it. When's the ball de-stream?
[8627.70s -> 8629.94s]  There's still blood all over my screen, by the way.
[8632.47s -> 8654.36s]  We get it. Oh my God. You guys are ruthless. I, yeah, I've got this like fucking medical
[8654.36s -> 8658.36s]  problem that's like really been bothering me for like two years. Where's Baldi?
[8661.96s -> 8672.38s]  Oh, it's something about it's like funny though. It kind of is to me. It's all good. Hey, thanks a
[8672.38s -> 8677.27s]  lot, Frody and Weapon for the 256. It's hard to hear about the hernia and ribs. I'm sure you don't
[8677.27s -> 8679.91s]  need to hear it from me, but take it easy. If you need to, I'm sure you'll overcome it.
[8682.12s -> 8691.42s]  Yeah, from all the things I've heard about, if it is costochondritis, is that some, it's some,
[8691.42s -> 8699.67s]  for some people, it's around for like a few years and then it just disappears. Oh yeah,
[8699.67s -> 8704.47s]  it's inflammation in your ribs, joint pain and joint problems inside your ribs. Oh, by the way,
[8704.47s -> 8710.70s]  it's not, it's gone now. It's been four years and now it's just not there anymore. What? What the
[8710.70s -> 8729.96s]  hell? What are you talking? What? Your body just balks it out. Check and make sure it's not a heart
[8729.96s -> 8741.43s]  thing. No, we've, we've eliminated every major organ in my body. At this point, I've had enough
[8741.43s -> 8748.63s]  blood tests and scopes and it's not anything going. I don't, it's, it would be shocking to me if this
[8748.63s -> 8765.54s]  was an organ problem. You need those. I know. Did you have an x-ray? Yes, I've had an MRI
[8766.02s -> 8776.92s]  and an x-ray of two different places and they confirmed a few things and there we go.
[8777.72s -> 8786.33s]  You want to look at, look at your x-rays on stream. Now that would probably be the strangest thing
[8786.33s -> 8792.63s]  that you would ever see on Twitch. Has no one's ever done that? Like you want x-ray of my spine?
[8793.19s -> 8809.21s]  What, you want to pretend to know what I'm looking at? No, I'm not going to do that.
[8809.78s -> 8825.22s]  That's super naked. That is naked 3.0. Put it up on your Reddit. Yeah, just make like a post.
[8825.22s -> 8828.42s]  Hey guys, here's the result. Here's all my MRIs. What's wrong with me?
[8835.78s -> 8842.73s]  I'm not doing that. That is strange. That's strange. That's really strange. I can't do that.
[8842.73s -> 8847.53s]  I can't do that. That's too fucked up for me. It's like, oh, here's like your x-rays of his back
[8847.53s -> 8851.77s]  and spine and shit. It's like, I don't know. No, no, no. I, you, I don't want you guys to see,
[8851.77s -> 8855.61s]  I don't want you guys to see me naked. I don't want you guys to see me times three naked.
[8858.52s -> 8866.34s]  Then my dream would just come true. But yeah, I have, I've got turmeric tea. I'm going to be
[8866.34s -> 8874.66s]  doing that. Drinking turmeric tea, probably taking some turmeric, try to eat more of an
[8874.66s -> 8881.99s]  anti-inflammatory diet. That's hard to fucking do though. Like no dairy, no processed meats,
[8881.99s -> 8890.55s]  no nothing fried, no gluten, no wheat. That's so no hydrogenated oils. If you live in 2019,
[8890.55s -> 8900.90s]  it's actually really hard to avoid all of those things. Because half of the shit that you ever
[8900.90s -> 8909.32s]  eat is just cooked in some kind of pressed oil. This is olive oil, which is, that's not inflammatory
[8910.04s -> 8919.88s]  or whatever. Just go vegan. I could never do it. I could never go vegetarian or vegan. I just,
[8919.88s -> 8926.36s]  I could not do it. I couldn't do it. I'd go crazy after like a, like a month. I'd lose my mind.
[8926.36s -> 8934.74s]  I'd turn into like Gollum. I love certain foods and certain meats so much. I could not,
[8934.74s -> 8948.47s]  I just would not be able to do it. Who's this? Hey Reddit, hey Jeremy, here are my MRI scans.
[8961.62s -> 8965.22s]  If you're a brand new viewer and you're brand new to that sub Reddit,
[8966.18s -> 8973.37s]  I'm, and you think that's me or something, you're gonna be, it's like, I, I, this person's like
[8973.37s -> 8983.69s]  freaking me out. But anyways, uh, thank you SadVega for the 300 bits. Thank you Freuding Weapon for
[8983.69s -> 8988.57s]  the 256. And thank you Gnarly for the 250. I had a hernia removed from my stomach when I was like six
[8988.57s -> 8993.37s]  or seven. I don't remember anything, but the dream I had when I went under, I was on a steel bed in
[8993.37s -> 8998.65s]  an empty room and a metal claw dug into my stomach and pulled my hernia out. It was a scary and
[8998.65s -> 9011.93s]  painful dream, but I got a dual popsicle afterwards. So easy, 10 out of 10. Oh my God. Thank you. Please
[9011.93s -> 9015.37s]  go out with my grandpa for the 500 bits. Hey Jeremy, just want to thank you for saving my
[9015.37s -> 9019.77s]  relationship. Uh, me and my girlfriend have had some hard times together and I didn't think our
[9019.77s -> 9034.20s]  relationship would last till we discovered the erotic, it's, um, it's hard to not, it's hard to
[9034.20s -> 9053.34s]  say this. Erotic, uh, no. No. Rat movie RP and since then our relationship is going strong.
[9053.34s -> 9076.17s]  Thank you. She's a giant rat. Okay. Shitty Viewbot, thanks for the 400 bits. Seems good. Hey,
[9076.17s -> 9080.65s]  Jerma, since this is the week of co-op and you might need some game recommendations, might as
[9080.65s -> 9085.54s]  well just pay day one and two. Uh, you decide whether you want to play or not and I hope your
[9085.54s -> 9092.10s]  hernia gets better. Me too. Um, well I know for the next day or two it's going to be Halo Reach.
[9093.72s -> 9098.04s]  After the stream tomorrow I think we'll probably just come to a consensus if we're just going to
[9098.04s -> 9105.72s]  do it the next stream. Maybe, uh, Joel and I will be like, oh that was fun, that was cool, but
[9106.52s -> 9111.03s]  maybe we don't want to finish it together. Maybe I would just, if he wasn't into it doing it again,
[9111.03s -> 9116.78s]  I would just do the rest. Something like that. We'll find out. And then there's another co-op
[9116.78s -> 9120.06s]  game that's already lined up. If that doesn't work though, then we'll probably look for something
[9120.06s -> 9137.38s]  else. Thank you. For the 400 bits. Uh, P flavor, thanks for the 300 bits. Jerma, I keep missing
[9137.38s -> 9142.58s]  your streams so stop streaming when I can't watch. Also here's your 6% Jerma tax. Sorry it's late,
[9142.58s -> 9153.78s]  please don't hurt my family. You say, you say this every time. Don't, this is like two or three of
[9153.78s -> 9162.20s]  you that have the same end to your messages. Hey, the coldest fridge, thanks for the 500 bits. Hi
[9162.20s -> 9165.72s]  Jerma, you told me that you would say happy birthday to me on stream three years ago,
[9165.72s -> 9182.09s]  but you never did. What? I just like put the phone in the back and put it, like throw it down there
[9182.09s -> 9187.53s]  and just have it. No, that's fucking weird. That's a good reverse surveillance video.
[9192.25s -> 9195.98s]  All right. Good night, everybody. Coldest bridge. Thanks for the $1.
[9196.70s -> 9200.15s]  Well, thanks for the $2 actually. Jerma, can I get a happy birthday message?
[9200.79s -> 9209.34s]  Uh, December 6th, like Nicholas. I'm going to have to start doing like, all right, I remember that.
[9210.06s -> 9218.14s]  December 6th? What's going on on the 6th? I don't know. Remind me. Siri, remind me in six days
[9218.78s -> 9226.74s]  to say happy birthday to the coldest fridge. Saved it. Got it. Thanks for the $3 coldest fridge.
[9226.74s -> 9229.70s]  That's one, two, three in a row. Okay, for real, thank you for the coolest beans stream.
[9232.78s -> 9244.07s]  Right. And that's three years ago. So in three days, it's your, it's your birthday again.
[9245.05s -> 9251.72s]  I've got another chance. I didn't mean I was going to say happy birthday to you
[9252.70s -> 9259.93s]  on your 25th birthday. I was talking about happy birthday on your 28th birthday. Remind me.
[9262.10s -> 9268.52s]  Siri, make a note here. Remind me on December 6th to say happy birthday to the coldest fridge.
[9271.45s -> 9285.00s]  Got it. There it is. Thanks for the 500 bits. Appreciate it. Stinky beaver. Thanks for the $2.50,
[9285.00s -> 9294.38s]  6% tax. Frank West and TK for a Jerma Rumble. Why is everything 6%? Why do I, why do I have to
[9294.38s -> 9309.77s]  take 6% of your money? What? Is that the number that we agreed upon somehow? 6% tax? I said that?
[9309.77s -> 9323.24s]  Oh, not a bad number. Hey, uh, Firo Swee. Thanks for the 400 bits. Dude, Jerma, thank you for
[9323.24s -> 9333.11s]  streaming on my birthday. Happy birthday. We've got one right now. It's Firo's birthday. Happy
[9333.11s -> 9345.59s]  birthday, Firo. Hope you had a good one. Happy birthday. Uh, Midna says, thanks for the 500 bits.
[9346.23s -> 9350.74s]  Hey, Jerma, I don't usually watch full streams due to my work schedule and only heard about
[9350.74s -> 9354.82s]  your medical procedure through SUS last week. Hope everything went well and you're feeling
[9354.82s -> 9364.26s]  better. Thanks for streaming. Yeah, I'm doing all right. I'm at the stage right now where I'm,
[9365.32s -> 9369.64s]  the, the light at the end of the tunnel is starting to open and I'm going, I can see through that.
[9370.73s -> 9374.65s]  I can see it. The beams kind of just hit me right in the eye and it's like, oh, oh, oh,
[9375.37s -> 9378.97s]  oh, it's so bright. And I'm, I'm going, I'm walking towards it. No, that's not a good,
[9378.97s -> 9385.45s]  that's a bad analogy. That means that, that means I'm dead. That's a terrible, no, no, the light at
[9385.45s -> 9391.78s]  the end. Don't go into the light, Jeremy. Don't go into the light. Go the other way. Open the door
[9391.78s -> 9399.43s]  that you came through. Uh, go away from the light. Right. Uh, I'm getting to the end of the road
[9399.43s -> 9410.17s]  here. That also is not a great analogy. Okay. I know what might be wrong with me. They're done.
[9410.17s -> 9418.92s]  So therefore, hopefully the next couple of months solutions start to be put in place as to this
[9418.92s -> 9424.36s]  fucking dumb mystery illness. So I kind of have some answers now. There you go. That's better than
[9424.36s -> 9438.20s]  don't walk towards the light. But yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry. I'm fine. It's not a significant
[9438.20s -> 9445.18s]  enough problem to really affect my day to day life. It's just kind of there. And I always know
[9445.18s -> 9451.88s]  it's there and it's just irritating, but it's not, it doesn't necessarily affect too much of my
[9451.88s -> 9461.10s]  actual day to day to day life. It just kind of hurts sometimes. It's just kind of, it just,
[9461.10s -> 9465.50s]  like, it just hurts a little. Not enough to really, you know, it just hurts a little. That's it.
[9469.75s -> 9478.52s]  Am I colorblind? I don't think so. But I appreciate it. Thank you. Hey, Flugboy,
[9478.52s -> 9482.28s]  thanks for the 250. You know how long I've been in this community. I thought I had seen everything
[9482.28s -> 9487.24s]  and I'm sure you've seen it by now, but someone put the fucking picture of you crying on their
[9487.24s -> 9492.46s]  credit card. I love this community with all my heart and they never cease to amaze me.
[9493.10s -> 9509.38s]  All right. But here's the thing. They, you have to hand that to the cashier. The cashier doesn't
[9509.38s -> 9516.57s]  know who I am. So I am almost taken completely out of that equation. That's the thing between
[9516.57s -> 9529.10s]  you and that cashier. They don't know me. And if they do, that you just surprised us the surprise
[9529.10s -> 9569.74s]  of the century. Somebody just leaked it. Okay. What the fuck, man? That's so fucking ridiculous.
[9571.74s -> 9575.74s]  Dunkin' Donuts. How does it look? Here's some Dunkin' Donuts because you have good news. You
[9575.74s -> 9594.94s]  can upload custom photos on Dunkin' Donuts gift cards. It's here. You guys are fucking,
[9594.94s -> 9602.58s]  you guys are fucking hilarious. But what's that person that you give it to?
[9608.12s -> 9614.73s]  Because you're epic. That's how I read that. Here's some Dunkin' Donuts. Because you're
[9614.73s -> 9628.20s]  epic. That's how I see it. Now, you know, put it in a greeting card now. You know those cards
[9628.20s -> 9634.34s]  that you open and they just talk. Put that, get that sound bite into a greeting card.
[9634.34s -> 9638.26s]  Put the Dunkin' Donuts card in there. And when it's opened, it plays that really shitty low
[9638.26s -> 9653.14s]  bitrate quality audio. I mean, you have my permission. We are almost at the end.
[9653.70s -> 9662.47s]  Let's get the credits rolling as they do. Let's move the scene over to here. Let's roll the
[9662.47s -> 9671.27s]  credits. Thanks for watching. Thanks for the subs. Holy shit. That's a lot of subs. I was gone for
[9671.27s -> 9677.62s]  about four days. So look at all these racked up subs. You guys are fucking awesome. Thank you.
[9677.62s -> 9683.88s]  Thanks for the support. Thanks for streaming. Thank you for streaming, guys. I really loved
[9683.88s -> 9694.06s]  that hand simulator stream. It was great. No, thank you for real. All of you. Let's head back
[9694.06s -> 9703.29s]  to the bits. Let's finish them up. Flugboy, thanks for the 250. You know how long I've been
[9703.29s -> 9706.97s]  in this community. I've seen everything and I'm sure you've seen it by now, but somebody put the
[9706.97s -> 9711.13s]  fucking picture of you crying on their credit card. I love this community with all my heart and
[9711.13s -> 9716.09s]  they never cease to amaze me. What? Somebody put it on the what somebody put my that image on
[9716.09s -> 9729.38s]  a what do you mean that image? You have a link? Hey, mad. Thanks for the 1500 bits mad. No, I'm
[9729.38s -> 9734.90s]  not kidding. Thank you, mad. Thanks for the 1500 bits. So it was my birthday on Thanksgiving,
[9734.90s -> 9741.78s]  which had a good meal. So here's your obligatory 10%. It was 6% must have gotten that incorrect.
[9741.78s -> 9745.38s]  Please let me out of your basement, Mr. Comedy Man. It's getting dark in here. Okay.
[9745.86s -> 9763.58s]  Okay. Oh, he spelled it. M-O-N-K-U-H. Monka S with two S's. Uh, phylactery. I missed
[9764.14s -> 9771.21s]  5000 bits from phylactery. Thanks for the $50 phylactery. Again, again, again, again, again,
[9771.21s -> 9781.21s]  50, 50, 50, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100. Thank you. And you say $50 for playing spill joke the game.
[9781.21s -> 9784.90s]  Love you, Jeremy. That level was huge. I didn't think it was gonna be that big.
[9785.54s -> 9799.77s]  It was 500 last time. Yeah. Yeah, it was. And who could forget Bob Boy? Bob Boy 61. I mean,
[9799.77s -> 9806.89s]  out of out of the potentially just thousands and thousands and thousands of community members,
[9806.89s -> 9813.37s]  Bob Boy 61 has got to be up there at least in like the top in the top like fucking
[9814.17s -> 9837.66s]  two to 300,000 people. Thank you, Bob Boy for the five subs. Appreciate it. You rank us. He's
[9837.66s -> 9843.50s]  picking favorites now. Yeah, he's in the top like two to three. How many people actually think,
[9843.50s -> 9847.91s]  watch this channel? I have no idea. How many people follow this channel? Two what?
[9849.46s -> 9852.58s]  250 something, 270. How many, how many followers are on this channel?
[9853.30s -> 9861.00s]  Well, I can't, I'm too, I'm too lazy to click over here apparently. How many followers do I have?
[9862.42s -> 9869.82s]  265,000 followers. Okay. So yeah, I, Bob Boy's definitely in somewhere in the top like 300,000.
[9869.82s -> 9888.15s]  That's a flex. How's that? What do you mean? How's that flex? Do a tier list of all your viewers,
[9888.15s -> 9901.10s]  all everyone that's followed. That would take probably five years to do that. If I did it
[9901.10s -> 9905.16s]  every single stream and it would never be finished because people would know that the stream was
[9905.16s -> 9911.96s]  happening and they would continue to make new accounts and follow. I would in the first week
[9911.96s -> 9920.57s]  of doing that stream, I would probably get 10,000 new followers. It would never end. You guys are
[9920.57s -> 9927.06s]  all up at, hold on. I don't want, wait a minute. I don't want you to think, you know, I don't want
[9927.06s -> 9932.92s]  you. Well, you, everyone, everyone's asked here. I don't know if I could say that. What about the
[9932.92s -> 9937.08s]  person that came in here and they may be followed the channel. They called me like a idiot like two
[9937.08s -> 9950.38s]  days ago. Is that person on S tier? This is not you making the tier list. This is me making the
[9950.38s -> 9966.63s]  tier list. Everyone except him. Yeah. Everybody except that person. Who is it though? I don't know.
[9967.43s -> 9977.66s]  M-O-N-K-U-H space B-S-S. I don't know. Who is it? Thank you back in for the 300 bits. Hi,
[9977.66s -> 9982.94s]  Jerma. Thanks for streaming as always. I'm losing, uh, I'm losing cognition more and more,
[9982.94s -> 9986.95s]  but hopefully my upcoming appointment should help maybe. Anyways, I hope you and Chad have a
[9986.95s -> 10001.61s]  wonderful day. Thanks for the 300 bits back in. Let's send some love and energy over to back in.
[10005.43s -> 10020.70s]  Thanks for the 300 bits. Hope you have a wonderful day. Take care. Thank you so much for the 300
[10020.70s -> 10038.57s]  bits. Send some Jerma hearts over to back in please. There we go. That's what I like to see.
[10040.04s -> 10055.22s]  That's what I like to see. Also, thank you to snoozingcopter for the 250. Hey, Jerma,
[10055.22s -> 10057.62s]  missed the beginning of the streams. I haven't heard the medical updates yet. Hope you're all
[10057.62s -> 10065.88s]  right. However, I wanted to say something else. You've been robbed. Oh no, there's more. There's
[10065.88s -> 10073.18s]  more. There's more. There's more. Any stories that you could share? I, I've, no, I've never
[10073.18s -> 10081.24s]  been robbed before. They said my girlfriend recently got her phone snatched out of her hands.
[10083.26s -> 10087.74s]  Holy shit, that's horrible. Currently seeing if they can access the cameras.
[10088.54s -> 10092.62s]  But it was a real shock. Some people are unbelievable. Also play Disco Elcium. Do it.
[10092.62s -> 10105.56s]  I just started it and I swear to god this game is made for you. Um, no, well, I've never been,
[10105.56s -> 10108.68s]  I've never been robbed. Like somebody comes up to you and says, hey,
[10108.68s -> 10128.54s]  give me your money or something. That's never happened. But Disco Elcium. I, I, maybe. That's
[10128.54s -> 10132.70s]  been kind of just sitting there. I feel like Disco Elcium is going to be dusk. I'm not going
[10132.70s -> 10136.14s]  to play it for like a year and then I'll play it and it'll be one of my favorite games I played
[10136.14s -> 10149.37s]  the whole year. That's kind of what happened with dusk. So that just count on it. Count on it. Hey,
[10149.37s -> 10154.25s]  Bobo Durago. Thanks for the 500 bits they say. Sup Jerma, I'm playing Apex Legends right now.
[10154.81s -> 10160.25s]  I absolutely love the game. Have you ever played it? I have not. Also nice stream and also my
[10160.25s -> 10171.27s]  username is pronounced Bobo Durango. Please say it. There's no N. It's, it's, it's Bobo Durago.
[10176.38s -> 10178.86s]  What have I done? What do you mean? What have I done? What did I do? What did I do?
[10187.43s -> 10193.27s]  Okay. Everyone's like, Oh my God. He said, like, okay, do you understand saying names out loud
[10193.27s -> 10199.46s]  that I, that I, I have many panic attacks when it's like, wait, he said it. He, he said the thing.
[10200.10s -> 10209.70s]  What did I say? What happened? Where? What did I do? It's like every like seven names or every
[10209.70s -> 10214.02s]  like 10 names is that one like panic attack moment where it's like, did somebody just phonetically
[10214.02s -> 10225.77s]  make me say something horrible? No, no, no, right? No, no, no. Okay. No. But no, I've never played
[10225.77s -> 10238.28s]  Apex. I'm not really into the BR thing was never my cup of tea. I heard, I heard that it was fun
[10238.36s -> 10249.88s]  if you liked BRs. But then I heard that it was not fun anymore. You won PUBG mobile on stream.
[10249.88s -> 10254.55s]  Yeah, but I only played PUBG mobile for like two weeks and then I just deleted it and never played
[10254.55s -> 10267.10s]  it again. But hey, KXE, thanks for the $20, 2000 bits from KXE. No message. Thank you.
[10267.90s -> 10276.81s]  Thanks for the 2000 bits. Uh, Squimpist, thanks for the 250. Hey Jermbo, just wanted to say,
[10276.81s -> 10281.85s]  I know chronic illnesses, pains. They're no joke. And I'm sorry about the bozos in chat who are mean
[10281.85s -> 10292.49s]  about it. Living with these things can be tough, but you're tougher. Godspeed. Yeah, but here's the
[10292.49s -> 10303.34s]  thing. It's not. I've had an annoying chronic illness for like more than 10 years. I, I kind
[10303.34s -> 10314.60s]  of know what to expect. I've had irritable bowel disease. It's just for, I don't know how long. I
[10314.60s -> 10319.48s]  was like a, I was a junior senior in college when I first had to start, started having the problems.
[10320.44s -> 10331.74s]  But that's, that's what 10, 12, 12 plus years ago, something like that. So, you know, I, it's, it's,
[10331.74s -> 10347.10s]  it is what it is. It is what it is. I'm just going to keep just, uh, kicking at it. You know what I
[10347.10s -> 10355.21s]  mean? Till I start to get some answers and some real solutions, right? Which those should be
[10355.21s -> 10363.29s]  starting very soon. Hey SaranRaps, thank you for the 300 bits. Hey Jerma, thanks for streaming despite
[10363.29s -> 10374.86s]  your health problems. Is the game Rain World on your radar? Rain World? Uh, what is Rain World?
[10375.58s -> 10392.15s]  Not Rim, not Rim World, right? I know Rain World. What is this game? This looks pretty cool.
[10392.15s -> 10403.46s]  Wow, are you like a little fox or something? Wayne's World? No. I'll punch that into Steam
[10403.46s -> 10413.70s]  after the stream, see what it looks like. It's very cute, very hard. But I mean, I, on stream,
[10415.54s -> 10428.97s]  I completed after only, on hard. So I think I'll be all right. It'd make a good what do I do stream
[10428.97s -> 10438.98s]  game. That's cool. Hey Gondolin, thanks for the 250. Hey Chumer, Chad plus Boomer, will you do a
[10438.98s -> 10444.95s]  video game award stream with your villain hair? Nah, I'll probably have a haircut by then. I'll
[10444.95s -> 10454.36s]  have a haircut by then. Thank you Gondolin, appreciate it. Thank you Saturn for the 500 bits.
[10454.36s -> 10458.36s]  Hey Jerma, it's inspiring that you have these health issues, like IBS, hernias, and back
[10458.36s -> 10462.52s]  problems, but you still get up and entertain us where others may not even get out of bed.
[10462.52s -> 10474.70s]  Much love. Here's the thing though. This is one of the, this is probably in the top one, two,
[10474.70s -> 10485.74s]  or three things that I care about in the whole world. I have to. It's, I care so much about
[10485.74s -> 10494.97s]  doing this. I have so much fun. This is so interesting to me that I, I would, I would
[10494.97s -> 10497.53s]  rather be doing this than something, anything else. You know what I mean?
[10503.38s -> 10509.80s]  And it's, it's not, don't get me wrong. It's not a scenario where I'm getting up and like forcing
[10509.80s -> 10517.13s]  myself to turn a stream on and I'm not healthy or happy or anything. No, that's not the case at all.
[10521.38s -> 10525.86s]  If that was the case, I just wouldn't do it. I just wouldn't turn the stream on,
[10528.49s -> 10532.65s]  which I've done many times, many, many, many times. I've pushed a stream, delayed a stream,
[10532.65s -> 10536.33s]  said, you know what? No, we're going to, we're going to do like three days, like Tuesday,
[10536.33s -> 10539.37s]  Wednesday, Thursday, instead of what I said, I would, you know, I'm not feeling it today.
[10539.37s -> 10555.54s]  I do it all the time. So do not worry about that at all. It's not, I'm not in a position right now
[10555.54s -> 10563.66s]  where it's a major, major, major issue or anything. It's just a minor problem that's going to take.
[10564.54s -> 10569.10s]  Here's the thing. It's some, it's a minor problem. That's going to take some potential major changes
[10569.10s -> 10580.68s]  for me to fix. Right. Then that's what you get. That's what you do. But I do appreciate it.
[10580.68s -> 10592.26s]  Appreciate the concern. Do not worry. Thank you produces. Thank you produces San for the 500 bits.
[10592.98s -> 10598.06s]  Want to thank you for making me laugh so much. This time when I have, there's times where I haven't
[10598.06s -> 10607.22s]  laughed so hard. Oh, sorry about that. I got like a bubble in my throat. Okay. Uh, there's time where
[10607.22s -> 10611.00s]  I haven't laughed so hard in my life. Thanks to you. It's been really making my days that much
[10611.00s -> 10615.40s]  better considering where I am now. Uh, kind of lost and drifting at the moment, trying to find
[10615.40s -> 10619.40s]  my place. But these laughs are well worth making me know the world is still turning.
[10620.20s -> 10623.80s]  And also the burger king has the whopper junior, which has the same great taste as the regular
[10623.80s -> 10633.88s]  whopper for a dollar 50, except it's fucking tiny. It's a small sandwich. Okay. It's, uh, it's a
[10633.88s -> 10641.32s]  whopper junior is, um, just, uh, Wendy's bacon, uh, Wendy's junior bacon. What the fuck? What's the,
[10641.32s -> 10645.08s]  what's the thing called with the huge bunch of lettuce on it? And they've got rid of the lettuce.
[10645.88s -> 10649.40s]  They changed it recently. It's just a tomato now. What's called the junior bacon cheeseburger
[10657.30s -> 10665.99s]  from Wendy's. I like, did they change the recipe or something? Cause I remember it had lettuce on
[10665.99s -> 10675.34s]  it and I didn't get lettuce last time. Wendy's is not kosher. Is any fast is, is McDonald's and
[10675.34s -> 10691.86s]  Burger King kosher? I don't think it is. No, McDonald's is not kosher. And what do you mean
[10691.86s -> 10705.62s]  kosher McDonald's and Burger King? There are rats. I can't even say that out loud because I don't
[10705.62s -> 10718.04s]  want to get like sued. Uh, there are rats in rat movie too. It's a fun movie. Only two or three
[10718.04s -> 10725.16s]  more to do. We've got, uh, shades fen, shades fen for two 50. Hey German, watching your VR stream
[10725.16s -> 10729.00s]  videos lately and didn't remember just how funny they were. You're going to do more VR before
[10729.00s -> 10736.84s]  half-life Alex. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Also ever since the, uh, I'm Jeremy Lammy and Parappa streams
[10736.84s -> 10741.48s]  have been massively hooked on the OST, especially the Jeremy Lammy one can never thank you enough
[10741.48s -> 10745.48s]  for all the laughs and introduced me to such an awesome music. Can't wait to see what you have in
[10745.48s -> 10755.58s]  store for us during December. I'll put these kids to sleep. Will you? Yes. There will be a, another
[10755.58s -> 10763.16s]  VR stream before a half-life Alex and by I'll probably just do, it'll be one of those scenarios
[10763.16s -> 10770.74s]  where, uh, is this even playing? Why is the music stopped? Okay. That was weird. Uh, it'll be a
[10770.74s -> 10779.61s]  scenario where we'll do like another five, 10 games over the course of a week. So yeah, I,
[10780.33s -> 10787.83s]  absolutely. And I will be, and I will be one of the, every single streamer on the website
[10787.83s -> 10801.93s]  that's doing half-life Alex at launch. Yes, they will. But thank you. Also, this is, uh, from
[10803.18s -> 10815.24s]  uh, Flugboy. It's a Twitter link and it's, it's the Dunkin Donuts gift card. This has 17,000 likes
[10815.88s -> 10821.64s]  and has been retweeted five fucking thousand times. I thought this was just like a few dozen of you
[10821.64s -> 10852.33s]  thought this was funny. What? What the fuck? Link the tweet. Uh, this five, I can't even get like
[10852.33s -> 10868.94s]  5,000 retweets on anything. Oh my God. It's cause you don't tweet. Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I
[10868.94s -> 10880.50s]  know. But when I do, when I do, that's so funny. And then the other tweet is the, the debit card,
[10880.50s -> 10894.95s]  the credit card. So I think somebody linked the picture already, but am I going to do Boneworks?
[10895.99s -> 10899.51s]  Yeah. If I'm going to do Boneworks, I need the new controllers though. I have to get those
[10899.51s -> 10910.01s]  index controllers. The game was made for it. When you do go viral, it's the mom baking cookies
[10910.01s -> 10920.54s]  of the drawstring tweets. Going viral. I'm going, Hey mom, I'm going viral. If you get the index
[10920.54s -> 10924.54s]  controls before Christmas, you get Alex for free. Is this really, that's a pretty good deal.
[10927.69s -> 10934.95s]  All right guys, we'll see you tomorrow. Joel and I are going to try to attempt to play, uh,
[10934.95s -> 10944.02s]  Halo Reach co-op. What did I just do? That's the wrong thing. It's this one. So see you tomorrow.
[10944.02s -> 10947.06s]  If something comes up for some reason, then we'll probably figure something else out.
[10948.02s -> 10958.71s]  Flugboy, thanks for the 250 right at the end here. I know I didn't add a caption that last one,
[10958.71s -> 10962.71s]  but I'm sure that you know what those links are by now. I hope you have a good rest of your night.
[10962.71s -> 10967.03s]  Wish me luck on my finals. Please. I really need it. Good luck on your finals. Hopefully you studied.
[10967.03s -> 10974.06s]  Hopefully you get that information we walked in. Thanks for the 250. Good luck on your finals,
[10974.06s -> 10985.53s]  Flugboy. Oh, Jerma real quick before you go, be ready for Reach not to work because it has
[10985.61s -> 10990.65s]  peer-to-peer connections. Well, that's bad. We're going to test it to make sure it does work.
[10991.29s -> 10999.54s]  And if it doesn't, then we'll figure something out. It is, you know what? You are right. It is
[10999.54s -> 11008.34s]  day one launch day of a brand new video game in 2019. It's guaranteed to not fucking work
[11008.34s -> 11015.66s]  as intended for at least six or seven days. Technically day two. You're right.
[11016.62s -> 11025.62s]  Halo brand new video game. Well, you know what I mean? Like a brand new launch.
[11026.26s -> 11030.58s]  That's been, it's a brand new, it's a launch of a game that has a lot of multiplayer connections.
[11031.46s -> 11037.34s]  We'll see. See you tomorrow. Take care of yourselves. Thanks for joining me on the
[11037.34s -> 11043.42s]  hand simulator. I'm medieval and visceral clean of detail. Triple stream. That's right. You got
[11043.42s -> 11054.95s]  three streams in one today. Stream three separate streams in one stream. Now I don't granted.
[11055.99s -> 11063.58s]  It was the first, the first hour and 40 minutes. Uh, for a lot of you was like having your teeth
[11063.58s -> 11071.96s]  pulled without novocaine, but it was fun. The streams, not even cannon. That's right. The
[11071.96s -> 11077.56s]  streams, not cannon. This is an expanded universe stream because I wasn't even going to scream
[11077.56s -> 11083.40s]  today, but I was like, you know what? Fuck it. Let's go. Let's play hand simulator and piss off
[11083.40s -> 11090.60s]  an entire community. That sounds like a good idea. Good night guys. See you tomorrow. Have a
[11090.60s -> 11104.38s]  wonderful rest of your night. Take care. Somebody said, didn't even try a hand simulator multiplayer.
[11105.18s -> 11113.08s]  They were burning my house down. I had to leave. Maybe I'll play it again in multiplayer.
[11114.28s -> 11126.12s]  Maybe you'll see it again. Fuck it. We'll do it. Halo reach. Let's go play with Joel. Yeah,
[11126.12s -> 11131.27s]  that's what's happening. Do you remember when me and Joel did the gamer challenge?
[11131.91s -> 11137.75s]  We made the gamer challenge like a year ago. Let's go. Gamer challenge activated. They're
[11137.75s -> 11145.21s]  going to be co-op game. Let's go. What time? Somewhere. Oh, let me see. I actually have it.
[11147.94s -> 11152.02s]  This also be correct, but just for you to know, be the first to know.
[11152.66s -> 11161.34s]  A year in the, it's a year in the works. It'll be, so because we're working
[11162.46s -> 11168.15s]  around both of our like streaming schedule, streaming times, it's going to be somewhere
[11168.15s -> 11179.11s]  around four PST. Joel doesn't have a schedule. Neither do I. So when you have two non-schedules
[11179.11s -> 11186.09s]  run into each other, you got to pick a time here. 4 p.m pacific state tomorrow. Good night. Take care.
