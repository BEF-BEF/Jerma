[2.62s -> 8.06s]  Hey, what is happening guys? Jerma here with the gameplay commentary. Spy, I don't think so.
[8.06s -> 14.46s]  Playing as the Pyro on Gold Rush, defense on Gold Rush, I'm using the strange flamethrower,
[14.46s -> 19.50s]  the strange flare gun, and the power jack. I don't use melee that often, so if you're wondering,
[19.50s -> 23.42s]  Jerma, why don't you use the extinguisher? Cause I'm an idiot and I can't use it.
[24.30s -> 29.34s]  Also, we started right in the beginning, because I was checking my steam messages
[29.42s -> 33.26s]  and standing completely still. And when I watched the demo back, I was like,
[33.26s -> 37.42s]  what the hell was I doing? Why am I just standing here? And I was like, all right,
[37.42s -> 41.99s]  I was just checking my messages. That's why we started right off the bat, right when the
[41.99s -> 47.03s]  card is coming out the door. No setup time, none of that malarkey. Let's get right into it here.
[47.03s -> 50.39s]  Let's do it, Jerma, let's do a shoutcast in the beginning. Why not? Let's go for it.
[50.39s -> 53.67s]  Walking up the stairs, Jerma sees a soldier, turns around, shoots him with a flare gun,
[53.67s -> 57.91s]  but he dies before Jerma can get any shots on him. Two teleporters up, and that's a very,
[57.91s -> 61.59s]  very fantastic thing for the engineers, because everybody can get out here as fast as they can.
[61.59s -> 65.11s]  Give him a couple of spritz here, trying to find a spy, does not see one. He gets a wrangled
[65.11s -> 68.95s]  sentry up, comes down nosy as the cover, gets the health pack, comes down here, sees a spy,
[68.95s -> 73.35s]  and a pyro, and an engineer, and I made up those names, gets the flare gun shot on that medic,
[73.35s -> 77.19s]  absolutely fantastic. He gets another shot on the flare gun with that sniper, and here comes a spy,
[77.19s -> 80.39s]  Jerma gets him, pops him in the air, misses with the shot, shoots him again, he's gonna get the
[80.39s -> 85.19s]  shot, he does not get the shot, but he kills him with the flame anyways. Oh my God, those are hard
[85.19s -> 93.14s]  to do. So, up here just protecting the sentry nest, and just really quickly I want to talk about
[93.14s -> 98.04s]  something that happened to me in the last couple days. Very, very scary stuff, I was terrified,
[98.04s -> 104.54s]  I was freaking out. So my computer, my big, expensive, crazy computer, crapped the bed on,
[104.54s -> 109.82s]  I think it was Friday or Thursday, one or two days ago. So I was getting blue screens and black
[109.82s -> 116.62s]  screens every time I turned on the computer, and I lost everything, guys. I had to reformat
[116.62s -> 121.98s]  everything, reinstall windows, reformat the hard drive, everything you could think of I had to do.
[121.98s -> 127.26s]  So now I'm starting from complete and total scratch, I had to reinstall Team Fortress.
[127.26s -> 131.27s]  Not like that fixed the crash problems, because they're still happening. I'm back in business,
[131.83s -> 135.43s]  nothing happened from it, I was really scared that I was gonna have to go rush out and buy
[135.43s -> 138.47s]  new computer parts so I could get some more videos out, because I want to make videos,
[138.47s -> 143.43s]  because I love doing it. Thank goodness I did not have to do that, though. So there is no concern,
[143.43s -> 147.43s]  I am back in business, even though I didn't go anywhere in the first place, just figured you
[147.43s -> 152.15s]  guys might want to know that. So let's get back into the gameplay. I've been practicing my flare
[152.15s -> 156.63s]  gun shots, guys. I've gotten a hell of a lot better than I was a couple months ago, or even a
[156.63s -> 163.45s]  few weeks ago, because I came to the realization that the flare gun is just the huntsman that
[163.45s -> 167.53s]  lights people on fire. And I'm pretty good with the huntsman, I'm decent with the huntsman, enough
[167.53s -> 171.85s]  where I'm confident on using it. I never wanted to use the flare gun, I was never good with it.
[171.85s -> 178.52s]  Demo right in my face. That was great. But anyways, if you can use the huntsman, you can use the flare
[178.52s -> 183.80s]  gun, they're both the exact same mechanic, they both almost have the same projectile speed,
[183.80s -> 188.36s]  and the same projectile movement. The flare gun I think has a little bit more drop-off than the
[188.36s -> 193.80s]  huntsman, but I've started playing with the flare gun as if I was using the huntsman, or the crossbow
[193.80s -> 198.68s]  for the medic. So start thinking like a huntsman when you're playing as the flare gun pyro.
[198.68s -> 203.27s]  If you are not good with the huntsman, and you're not good with the crossbow with the medic,
[203.27s -> 206.87s]  there's not a whole lot of advice I can give you right now, other than just try to get good
[206.87s -> 211.11s]  with your timing, and try to get good at leading your targets. It's a little easier with the flare
[211.11s -> 215.67s]  gun, because most of the time, you're going to be lighting somebody on fire, like you'll see me do,
[215.67s -> 220.31s]  pop them in the air, and shoot them with the flare gun and kill them. That's a little easier to me
[220.31s -> 224.15s]  than trying to get a headshot with the huntsman. Here's a good example right here, this scout light
[224.15s -> 228.71s]  him on fire, instantly shoot him with the flare gun, he is dead instantly, almost within two seconds
[228.71s -> 232.63s]  of him coming out of the spawn. That's what you want to try and do, you want to try and just get
[232.63s -> 237.35s]  somebody lit, don't really have to try and hold the mouse button on him, just get them on fire,
[237.35s -> 242.15s]  move them around a little bit, try and time it, get the flare gun shot. You will kill most classes
[242.15s -> 247.11s]  in the game with one shot, maybe two, if you're dealing with a heavy, or a soldier, or something
[247.11s -> 253.03s]  like that. Now this part is lucky crit fire activation right now, kill four people in like
[253.03s -> 258.23s]  two seconds, pop that sniper in the air, shoot him with the flare gun, get the kill, we're not done
[258.23s -> 263.43s]  yet, coming over to the spawn, see that heavy, blast him back into the spawn door, light all these
[263.43s -> 271.19s]  people on fire, it's just absolute chaos, get the shot, more flare fire, oh my god, I killed seven
[271.19s -> 278.89s]  people right there, that was unbelievable, I was like wow, pyro for the win. Coming back around
[278.89s -> 284.09s]  here on the side again, get the flare gun kill on the sniper again, see the entire team coming out
[284.09s -> 288.31s]  there, I was like no way I'm running into that. Backing up here shooting the flare gun a couple
[288.31s -> 292.47s]  more times, trying to get some shots, get it on that heavy, coming up here guys, make sure you do
[292.47s -> 296.63s]  this too, spray around just once or twice when you come up to a sentry nest, only because your
[296.63s -> 301.77s]  engineers would really appreciate it, a spy that comes back here could really damper the team,
[301.77s -> 305.53s]  here comes an uber soldier, it doesn't matter, he doesn't really go that far, those engineers had
[305.53s -> 309.93s]  that sentry pretty much on lockdown, trying to dance around right here, me and him having a
[309.93s -> 314.33s]  dancing competition, I end up winning the contest, I got first prize, they gave me a blue ribbon and
[314.33s -> 318.50s]  everything. Coming back to the spawn again, they don't want me up here, I'm not going to do it
[318.50s -> 322.42s]  either, I'm going to run backwards, here comes a heavy with the, I think that's the brass beast,
[322.42s -> 326.52s]  who knows what he's got, I'm just getting the hell out of there. I want to bring this up right now
[326.52s -> 331.48s]  because I feel like somebody else might agree with me, does anybody else get motion sickness
[331.48s -> 336.84s]  from the Gerardi on their screen? I get physically sick whenever the Gerardi's on my screen with
[336.84s -> 342.28s]  like the wavy yellow bubbly kind of feel to it, every time that happens I kind of look down for
[342.28s -> 348.68s]  a second because I know that I'm going to be like, oh I'm going to like puke if I see it for any
[348.68s -> 354.17s]  longer, so if you get that too let me know, I'm pretty curious. So for the first time in the entire
[354.17s -> 358.57s]  match the blue team is finally getting onto the cart with less than a minute and a half to go,
[358.57s -> 362.89s]  I get a nice reflect right here, they get covered in Gerardi, the rest of the team goes down, this
[362.89s -> 367.45s]  push was nullified, come up here up in the top left here you'll see this is a great direct hit
[367.45s -> 372.65s]  reflect, right there I get a kill, don't end up getting the victory on the soldier though because
[372.65s -> 377.61s]  you'll see I get absolutely humiliated, go for the melee kill and then I'm a little too quick to pull
[377.61s -> 383.61s]  it out again and he smashes me in the face, skipping all of the respawn times on this particular
[383.61s -> 389.77s]  gameplay because the respawn time on this server was like 17 seconds and that's a little too long
[389.77s -> 394.01s]  for me especially in a gameplay, you got to cut that out because it's kind of boring, coming around
[394.01s -> 398.57s]  to the side here 30 seconds left trying to stop them from coming, I missed this I thought I was
[398.57s -> 402.17s]  going to get it that would have been awesome but I get the kill anyways and I get another kill from
[402.17s -> 407.53s]  the afterburn on that scout I believe, any of a century here I did not see it before but I get
[407.53s -> 412.33s]  smoked by it and that is going to be the end of the gameplay for the rest of the time I'm just
[412.33s -> 417.30s]  sitting out because look at the respawn time 17 seconds, thank you all so much for watching I
[417.30s -> 422.10s]  really do appreciate it, I'll see you guys all next time and take care everybody.
