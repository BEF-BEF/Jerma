[0.89s -> 61.05s]  Good afternoon. Where's my coffee? What? It disappeared. I'm here now. Hello everybody.
[62.81s -> 75.40s]  Good afternoon. We're going to continue Chibi-Robo. Now if I finish it tonight, that's a question.
[76.76s -> 85.30s]  I should. I don't see why I will not, considering there's only about six hours, seven hours left
[85.30s -> 93.98s]  in the game. We should do it tonight. Thank you for joining me. Taking an extra second. Why am I out
[93.98s -> 100.38s]  of breath? If I, well, I guess I just sprinted. That makes sense. Yeah, I did just sprint.
[101.10s -> 105.94s]  I hit the mute button. Yeah, I'm an idiot. I hit the mute button. I got up and I like
[108.50s -> 122.65s]  grab. We got a long hallway. So I'm good. Are you guys ready for Chibi-Robo part two?
[125.38s -> 129.26s]  Coffee's worth it. Yes, it is. It's always worth it to get a coffee.
[131.86s -> 137.14s]  Mansion. Yeah. When you describe to people that you're full sprinting for more than three to four
[137.14s -> 143.22s]  seconds down your hall, you have a, I guess you have a big house. It may have been embellishing
[143.22s -> 152.65s]  a little, but anyways, let's go. I don't need to wait because I don't need to introduce this
[152.65s -> 158.89s]  because we just did it yesterday. And I, here we are. Caffeine is terrible for you.
[159.85s -> 177.86s]  Yes. Or bananas, apparently. Yeah. Don't have it. I don't ever do it. Sorry. I don't ever do anything
[177.94s -> 184.82s]  wrong, right? Don't ever drink caffeine. Don't ever fucking go to an R rated movie, right? Don't
[184.82s -> 195.24s]  ever do anything wrong. Only drink water and sit in your house and lie in your bed and look at the
[195.24s -> 201.80s]  ceiling. And every so often get up and stretch and only eat lettuce. Um, well, lettuce is bad for you
[201.80s -> 217.62s]  too because fucking the Romaine scare. Yeah. Literally don't do anything ever. Way ahead of
[217.62s -> 225.85s]  you. Live the tortoise life. Oh, don't be in the water because there's all the bacteria and all
[225.85s -> 232.62s]  the fucking gross shit in the water, in our oceans. No, no, don't go swimming. Don't drink coffee.
[232.62s -> 247.29s]  The only thing that you should do is fart on your webcam. That's the only thing you should be doing.
[249.46s -> 255.54s]  Well, what the fuck can I do then? You tell me. All right. So, uh, I have to go upstairs.
[256.44s -> 261.88s]  Quick recap. I'm a household robot. I fix things. I help with the family. I put sugar in people's
[261.88s -> 269.64s]  cups. I clean stains off the ground. Uh, mom and dad are about to go through a divorce probably.
[269.64s -> 276.07s]  Typical robot helper robot stuff. So we're going up to mom's room right now to find out what's going
[276.07s -> 287.54s]  on, which was the foyer, which we're going to go this way. Yep. Frash. Get it. Oh yeah. And there's
[287.54s -> 297.99s]  a dead frog outside that I could have saved four hours ago. Wait, I want to give, um, Ribbit Girl.
[297.99s -> 311.66s]  Ribbit Girl's very sad, by the way. Ribbit, maybe. What is this? Is us in, is, is, oh wait,
[311.66s -> 323.34s]  I think that's the other robot. Yeah, that, that, because that's, that's the old robot. The, the one
[323.34s -> 341.94s]  that everyone was their best friend. Yaybit. 13 happy points. Spread the happiness. That's you and
[341.94s -> 350.81s]  her. We also, we have a con. Yeah, we do. We have frog rings. We have to collect frog rings for her.
[350.81s -> 366.81s]  She loves them. And there's, I think, six or five more in the house. How many more? Five more. Ribbit.
[369.53s -> 376.23s]  Everybody loves Chibi Robo. I, where's the trash can? I gotta, I have a lot of trash. Remember I,
[376.23s -> 381.19s]  remember I went underneath, um, her bed and I picked up like three years worth of trash
[381.19s -> 390.92s]  under the bed. This game is dumb. I really don't give out permanent bands that often.
[391.64s -> 418.52s]  Don't make me start now. Hey, we got a Wink. Look at all this trash. Ten. Oh, look at that mound of
[418.52s -> 429.05s]  spitballs. I have two boxes. Yep. Wait, no, no, do I, no, I already fed the fish plenty of time.
[431.50s -> 439.64s]  44 happy points. Holy shit. Wet to dry in one frame. Well, you can tell when I was sitting here
[439.64s -> 443.48s]  testing and making sure it worked and everything for the first time. You can tell when that was.
[444.52s -> 458.94s]  And it's like probably 40 minutes ago. All right, wait, I'm gonna clean. See, I'm helping.
[459.66s -> 466.76s]  As per the title of the livestream, I'm going to help. Show memory card are emulated. You can,
[466.76s -> 471.59s]  I don't care if you think this is emulated at this point. That's not like some thing that I'm
[471.59s -> 475.88s]  going to be like, how dare you? No, not me. I don't care. You, if you, if you think this is emulated,
[475.88s -> 480.44s]  I'm glad. If you think this is on original hardware, I'm also very glad. I'm very glad
[480.44s -> 489.94s]  about those things. I don't care. He did show the memory card. He slammed it in a door. Yeah,
[489.94s -> 500.94s]  I did two days ago. All right, it's time. It's time to go into mom's room. What's in mom's room?
[502.10s -> 516.97s]  First, let me charge the emulator. This is pre-recorded. Don't stop saying that. You're
[516.97s -> 523.59s]  going to get me in fucking trouble. I haven't turned on an actual live broadcast in like two
[523.59s -> 539.80s]  and a half years. It's not fucking with my game. All this is pre-recorded. I just, I sit here with
[539.80s -> 547.34s]  it on one of my monitors while I'm watching lost right now on my other monitor. I'm in season four.
[547.34s -> 560.47s]  It gets good, right? And I just chime in sometimes. You want to know how to use the warp bot. Oh yeah,
[560.47s -> 567.54s]  this is new. Insert your plug to power it up. When the energy field appears, climb on top of
[567.54s -> 572.34s]  the utility bot and automatically be transported to the other warp utility bot. Well, where is it?
[572.34s -> 585.10s]  Let's test this. This is the foyer. It goes to, that's a adorable sound. It just goes upstairs.
[585.10s -> 596.46s]  Oh, wow. That's better than having to fly over on the banister. I'm really,
[596.46s -> 600.62s]  really happy you said season four. It's the best season, Jerma. Thank you. I'm looking forward to
[600.62s -> 612.78s]  it. All right, sorry. Back to the regularly scheduled pre-recorded Jeremy. Okay. Gotta clean
[612.78s -> 624.70s]  this up. Good, good. Happy points for that one. Okay. 165 stains. Time for a cleaning bonus.
[625.98s -> 636.15s]  Happy points. Oh, the reverb is on. There was a lot of reverb on there. I was trying to make it.
[636.15s -> 650.02s]  Whatever. The reverb was dialed up a lot. I got a lot of points for that. Why does reverb equal
[650.02s -> 656.02s]  pre-recorded? Well, because that means I've opened 30 windows within a 10th of a second
[656.58s -> 661.13s]  of the same stream. That's what that means. Sorry, guys. I fucked it up. I'll fix it.
[662.49s -> 685.98s]  I'm getting the trash. I'm going to go to mom's room. That would be a delay echo.
[686.54s -> 694.12s]  Not if they were all opened within a 10th of a second. You would hear a lot of reverb.
[694.92s -> 704.82s]  He's wrong. Wrong. I'm an audio engineer. I went to school for audio engineering. I think I know
[704.82s -> 736.04s]  what I'm talking about. So did I. Show degree. Well, I never said I graduated. I said I went.
[736.68s -> 742.07s]  I mean, I did pretty poorly and had been stopped after about two classes.
[744.78s -> 755.38s]  All right. Let's go in mom's room. Let's find out what's going on. It's time.
[755.94s -> 775.43s]  We're going to find out what's in here. Here we go. He was a neat. All right. Bedroom. New area.
[776.39s -> 783.50s]  What is the secret in here? There's a frog. Specifically, there's an alive frog right here.
[785.59s -> 805.19s]  It's dead, too. Dead frogs everywhere. What's that? Let's go and have a closer look.
[807.74s -> 818.84s]  It looks like a frog. But how horrible. Who could have done such a thing?
[824.17s -> 829.75s]  You think it could have been Tao? I mean, maybe the dog could have picked it up and
[830.71s -> 842.92s]  thrown it around. Probably. It's possible. I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I can't
[842.92s -> 847.98s]  jump to conclusions like that. I don't know. Yeah, you're right. He already has plenty of
[847.98s -> 860.15s]  food and bones and stuff. I mean, who could have? Huh? It's a Tyrannosaurus Rex stuffed animal in
[860.15s -> 872.15s]  this room. Chibi robo. There's something over there. What are you talking about? There's
[872.23s -> 882.01s]  nothing there, Tally. Wait a minute. It really was something over there. I'm going to go take a look.
[887.32s -> 906.55s]  Okay, so another dead frog. I don't know what to do. Poor guy. Yeah, what am I supposed to do?
[907.27s -> 911.11s]  I need water. All right, we got to get a good, we got to make a perimeter here.
[911.91s -> 923.10s]  Ticket stub. Wait, can I drag this? Save him. I can't. Holy shit. I'm strong. What's in here?
[923.10s -> 936.36s]  Can I open the briefcase? There's probably something in the briefcase, right? Charge the frog.
[936.92s -> 940.76s]  That's not going to help. Let me clean under the bed first and we'll figure it out.
[941.40s -> 951.86s]  What's this? For seat one, chibi robo equals crazy moola. I'm very expensive. Okay. Well,
[951.86s -> 961.26s]  we knew that. Charge the frog. Charge the frog. If I put the plug near that frog,
[961.26s -> 971.19s]  it's going to zap him and kill him. So, no. Why would I use a defib on a frog that's currently
[971.19s -> 981.62s]  breathing? The frogs, that's not the point. What are you talking about? Why would I use a defib
[981.62s -> 990.95s]  on a frog that's awake and alert and breathing and has a heartbeat? He's just thirsty and there's
[990.95s -> 995.59s]  another one outside that's also thirsty. I just need thirsty. I need to, I can't wake him up. What
[995.59s -> 1014.09s]  do you want me to do? Absorb his power. All right. I got to look for some other stuff in here.
[1014.09s -> 1019.94s]  How about, um, wait, I can go on top of this. Can I, can I drag this all the way over? How far
[1019.94s -> 1028.65s]  can I bring this? I can't jump on top of here. It won't open if you don't know the correct password.
[1029.37s -> 1039.32s]  Oh, we need the pad. This is the secret right here. That's the secret we need to know the
[1039.32s -> 1045.66s]  password. We've got to find out. We've got to get the password from mom, right? All right. In the
[1045.66s -> 1051.66s]  meantime, let me go over here. Isn't mom going to know that I, that somebody was in looking at the
[1051.66s -> 1072.68s]  briefcase? Wait, what about the shoes? Anything hidden? Point. Pull it out. I'm going to pull this
[1072.68s -> 1086.01s]  up. Is there a bug up here? There's a demon door. Mom's going to give us her password.
[1087.42s -> 1099.27s]  Oh, there's a lot of trash on mom's desk. Jeremy, what's your social? Oh, that's easy. Uh, zero,
[1099.35s -> 1117.54s]  zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, one. I was the first person. Can I get up there?
[1117.54s -> 1124.09s]  I got to climb. Same joke years later.
[1127.77s -> 1135.77s]  Pogchamp. Dude, Pogchamp. Remember when he did that like in 2014? Probably. I don't know.
[1136.33s -> 1150.01s]  Is mom going to be mad that I'm in the bedroom cleaning? Let's get a good view. All right. We
[1150.01s -> 1158.31s]  got dead frog. This other side ticket stub. Holy shit. We'll get all those doors up there.
[1162.25s -> 1169.40s]  All right. I'm going to try to, how do I get up there? That's a lot. Get on the fan. Get on the
[1169.40s -> 1175.51s]  fan. Get on the fan. I mean, I can't right now. I got to find a way up there. Let's do the baseline
[1175.51s -> 1185.14s]  stuff first. Like over there. I got to get up there on the window sill. What is that? What the
[1185.14s -> 1207.38s]  hell is that? All right. Investigate. Mission. You need to recharge your, yeah, me. I need to
[1207.38s -> 1214.57s]  recharge me. You're right. It's a good tip. Can I get up there? Can I climb anything over this way?
[1215.29s -> 1228.87s]  Is that these ladders? Yes, they are. You almost fell for it. Almost. You got a keyword there.
[1228.87s -> 1241.32s]  Almost. Can I turn the radio on to turn on the turntable? I should be able to. All right. Who
[1241.32s -> 1258.71s]  the hell is this? I pull the thing and hmm. I can't grab that. It's like a flower freaking out
[1258.71s -> 1273.32s]  over here. I got to open up the window. I can't get up there. Can I shoot it? Yeah, look, it's
[1273.32s -> 1289.58s]  right there. Can I dislodge it? Maybe I can dislodge it. Shit. I want to get up there.
[1290.30s -> 1311.13s]  Can I climb anything else? Hey, let me in. Oh, well. Maybe I need something else. What's this?
[1311.93s -> 1319.16s]  I can't interact with the big speaker thing.
[1334.94s -> 1344.07s]  Shit. I need the, I need the big, I need the ladder. I think there's not, I need the,
[1344.07s -> 1346.79s]  okay, there's a briefcase in here, but I can't do anything with the briefcase.
[1347.59s -> 1371.74s]  I guess I can land on this. Anything on here? Can't climb this. Oh, well. Oh, wait, what's that?
[1372.46s -> 1380.23s]  Look at that. We need the passcode for the briefcase, but I can pull this.
[1380.23s -> 1398.63s]  Is this the blinds? A hat? Oh, it looks like you can use this to climb up. All right, well.
[1400.23s -> 1411.66s]  Don't water the frog. I can't. I don't have a means to. Woody Woodpecker charge noise.
[1417.03s -> 1436.89s]  That's pretty good. I love it. All right, let's climb up this shit. I hate that Woodpecker. Why?
[1436.89s -> 1445.70s]  Why do you hate Woody Woodpecker? How do you even hate Woody Woodpecker? It doesn't make any sense.
[1445.70s -> 1474.84s]  Why? Bell? Ring the bell. Wait a minute. This is gonna, I stand on it? This is, I can't hit it.
[1474.84s -> 1504.12s]  I'm trying to ring it. Oh, what does that do? Somebody to come open the door? Uh, ticket stub.
[1504.12s -> 1507.96s]  Can I fly from here? No, I definitely can't fly from here. I'm just gonna land on the,
[1508.76s -> 1528.89s]  I mean, I rang the bell. Hello? The fuck is this? Who lives in here? You open the peephole.
[1529.85s -> 1537.93s]  Now you can pass through here at night. Oh, now I can come in here at night. Shortcut. Nice. All
[1537.93s -> 1551.78s]  right. Well, how do I, can I climb up this? Look at this. Oh yeah. Look at that frog ring over there.
[1552.50s -> 1562.36s]  All right. I'm going to go fly over this way. No, I can't make it. All right. Well, I'll come back
[1562.36s -> 1577.43s]  at night. Let me see where this goes. Oh shit. How do I? Okay. Then I can climb up. Okay. I can climb
[1577.43s -> 1583.56s]  up the, this thing over here. Let me see. Yeah. So I can climb that all the way up. Good. Good to
[1583.56s -> 1605.98s]  know. All right. Cool. Did I miss anything else in, uh, in the kid's room? Yes, you did. Well,
[1605.98s -> 1615.64s]  let's go take a look. Remember, it didn't wink. I fucking, I have a thing that tells me if there's
[1615.64s -> 1622.25s]  winks, the winks, the winks are real and I didn't even look. I just believed you for no reason. I
[1622.25s -> 1637.06s]  have a, is today the last wink day? No, it'll be a day or two. Like it's going to be, uh, Tuesday
[1637.06s -> 1657.14s]  is the last day for wings and they're going to be significantly reduced in price. All right. Let me,
[1657.14s -> 1686.78s]  uh, do something for it. We can go talk to the Frankenstein guy, but hold on. So almost out of
[1686.78s -> 1693.58s]  time though. I had to put this trash, I see trash and I need to get it. I'm obsessed with trash.
[1694.30s -> 1700.58s]  I'm obsessed with it. Look, I, I, it's wasting time, but I have to open this and go get it.
[1703.46s -> 1706.18s]  You see, I've wasted so much time. I have to pick up every piece of trash.
[1708.10s -> 1724.47s]  I think I leveled up too. All right. It's nighttime. We can go into mom's room at night.
[1727.42s -> 1737.18s]  Great work out there. Let's adjust your happy points. What about my ranking? I am now in the
[1737.18s -> 1744.30s]  top 10 of all chibi robos in the world. Special gift, a brand new bonus battery.
[1744.94s -> 1754.63s]  1800. Yeah. 880. So good. Top 10 chibi.
[1757.67s -> 1771.91s]  I do have money though. Let's see what I want to spend it on. Top chibi streamer. Speech, speech.
[1774.34s -> 1781.54s]  Guys, I just want to say I never would have got here if it wasn't for all of you leaving
[1781.54s -> 1788.41s]  your cans and bottles scattered throughout the house and not walking even two feet to the trash
[1788.41s -> 1795.83s]  can and for dropping oil all over the ground and never cleaning the vents above your stove.
[1796.55s -> 1816.28s]  Without this, I never would have made it. Thank you everybody. Range chip, passive aggressive speech.
[1817.56s -> 1827.93s]  We'll start cleaning. How's that for aggressive aggressive? All right. I'm going to get the
[1827.93s -> 1839.67s]  range chip. Fire long distance blaster shot. I want it. And I also want another battery too. Yep.
[1846.70s -> 1853.48s]  Kitchen bridge. A bridge that stretches far placed near the planter. All right. I got,
[1854.04s -> 1880.28s]  I got so much to do. You're an asshole. You made my daughter cry. What? All right.
[1884.12s -> 1888.52s]  Let's put the rest in here.
[1899.72s -> 1909.58s]  I'm sorry. I tried to do it exact. I got caught. All right. Uh, I can, I have to do a thousand at
[1909.58s -> 1927.58s]  a time. You're doing diva. Diva is Elmo is Gollum. We want shit. We need shit. Diva reporting for
[1927.58s -> 1944.62s]  duty. It's also one of the Ed brothers. It could be anyone, Eddie. It could even be Elmo. It could
[1944.62s -> 1962.15s]  be anybody. Plus two, hire him. Something about being available. All right. Let's go to, uh,
[1962.15s -> 1972.42s]  let's go to mom's room at night. Mom's room at night. Where's the warper in the foyer behind me?
[1972.42s -> 1997.42s]  I can't stop thinking about woody woodpecker. Yeah. It was a great reference. Great.
[2015.30s -> 2038.65s]  Let's hear it again. No, I love it. I can't wait to hear it again. All right. Into mom's room.
[2041.27s -> 2049.58s]  Anything new? Okay. I teddy bear. I went, I went into mom's room. Mom locks the door at night and
[2049.58s -> 2064.31s]  she leaves the door open all day. I'll handle this. Diva Gollum, double D Elmo quad impression.
[2064.87s -> 2080.62s]  Why did you even clip that wrong door? So what does this change at night or something?
[2080.62s -> 2097.51s]  Is mom just in here sleeping? Is there anything we do because like, is there something we can do
[2097.51s -> 2102.71s]  while mom is asleep? Like go in her drawer and find a key or? I don't understand. Why would I
[2102.71s -> 2109.32s]  do this at night? Does mom like bring like this password up here and put it somewhere? I don't
[2109.32s -> 2138.01s]  understand. Well, we're going to find out. What are we going to do? These bills are piling up.
[2138.57s -> 2142.84s]  On top of that, the electric bill has skyrocketed. See, I am a problem.
[2146.73s -> 2159.38s]  He's just hopeless. Okay. We need to, that is what if I make, what if I make my presence known?
[2164.31s -> 2173.83s]  What is that up there? Wait a minute. What is that? You see this thing? What is this? Like a secret.
[2174.47s -> 2193.82s]  Hi mom. Uh, is it something? Should I make my presence known? Say hello? Uh, yeah, I guess I
[2193.82s -> 2203.08s]  could say hi. Hi there Chibo. How'd you get in here? Did you come to check on me because
[2203.08s -> 2219.40s]  you were worried about me? Yes. Thank you Chibo. 52. I bet Jenny and her dad asked you to check
[2219.40s -> 2224.84s]  up on me. Well, since you're here, would you mind keeping me company? I'm balancing our
[2224.84s -> 2229.48s]  checkbook, but something just doesn't add up. Oh, you want me to do math? I'm exhausted.
[2230.12s -> 2233.72s]  I wonder if there's a toy receipt I'm missing. I bet he's hiding one somewhere.
[2234.52s -> 2240.46s]  It was a receipt. I asked him about earlier and he said, don't worry. You have all,
[2240.46s -> 2245.13s]  that was a great impression. When it comes to toys, I don't know if I can trust him to have
[2245.13s -> 2250.33s]  any self-control. Oh, can you do me a favor Chibo? See if you can find a hidden toy receipt. I think
[2250.33s -> 2256.86s]  I know where it is. Bring it back to me if you find one. If you do, my husband will have explaining
[2256.86s -> 2263.00s]  to do. Isn't it like right here? GB robo. Crazy move. A hidden toy receipt.
[2265.99s -> 2273.11s]  Shit. That's not it. Oh mom, you're gonna do anything about the dying frog in the middle of
[2273.11s -> 2285.24s]  the room. He's just sleeping. No, I don't have it in my inventory. It's hidden somewhere. Hidden
[2285.24s -> 2299.35s]  receipt for a toy. Let me check up here for a second. I still have to throw my trash away. I
[2299.35s -> 2310.55s]  have a lot of it. Anything over here? I thought those were Pop Tarts and a toaster. That's my,
[2310.55s -> 2315.27s]  that's my actually, actually mutated brain. Just thought that. It's like, oh, Pop Tarts and a
[2315.27s -> 2340.65s]  toaster. Let's plug it. Let's go to the other room. I can't connect. You're connected. You're
[2340.65s -> 2356.28s]  right here. Toy receipt. Where does dad even hang out? Does dad only hang out on the sofa? Is that
[2356.28s -> 2376.73s]  it? On the toilet. Dad hangs out in the bathroom. He saw the receipt already. Well that, no, that
[2376.73s -> 2400.30s]  was the Chibi robo one. That's not the right one. Dad lives in the walls. It's a wall dad. God. I
[2409.56s -> 2414.04s]  want to go back into Jenny's room. I didn't explore everything in Jenny's room. I picked up
[2414.04s -> 2418.92s]  trash and had to leave. I wish I could use the Stuart Little Car, but that's unfortunate. I can't.
[2418.92s -> 2442.41s]  Why? Why is she so sad? Well, she's upset that her parents are not getting along. It's kind of sad
[2442.41s -> 2460.28s]  because she's really sad. I'd hate to see their electric bill. Yeah, she was talking about it.
[2464.92s -> 2470.84s]  All right. What have we got? Okay. Thank God. Let's dump all this crap. I have a lot of it.
[2471.48s -> 2489.64s]  Look at that. Like five wrappers, can of orange juice, party poppers, wads of junk. What's the 1500?
[2499.22s -> 2520.60s]  Okay. What are you doing here? Hello, space hunter robo. Look at that. That towering castle
[2521.90s -> 2525.02s]  and all the way at the top of it. What do I see?
[2525.98s -> 2536.09s]  Oh, a delightful damsel. He gazes down at me with lost eyes. I can tell her heart aches for justice.
[2537.34s -> 2550.71s]  Listen, he's jumping. Space hunter code. He's going to jump up to that table and try to jump
[2550.71s -> 2556.65s]  to the microwave and fall five times and then fucking leave. Be like, never mind. This game
[2556.65s -> 2565.86s]  sucks. Drake Redcrest must speak to her. She needs my attention. However, a minor obstacle stands in
[2565.86s -> 2574.73s]  my way. How am I supposed to get up there? One called Mort will know what to do. I'm at a loss,
[2574.73s -> 2583.29s]  but the destiny of a space hunter is to find the truth. All right. Well, hold on. Let me,
[2583.29s -> 2591.29s]  let me just get up here. Wait, is he talking about the guy under the bed? He's talking about the
[2592.17s -> 2601.86s]  Frankenstein guy under the bed? He was a syringe? That's a squirter from a doctor's kit.
[2602.66s -> 2609.75s]  It's probably Jenny's. Looks like you can pull up water with it. Bingo. You can spray it on all
[2609.75s -> 2629.66s]  sorts of things. We just saved the frog. Wow. Yes. Okay. Cool. Oh, is this a TV?
[2642.17s -> 2650.78s]  That was a really good show. I love the part when the bear got mad at the honey not being in there.
[2651.74s -> 2682.84s]  Can I get on top of the TV? I still have time to explore in here. Why not? Bear actually mad.
[2683.64s -> 2705.45s]  Bear actually. Wait, that was telling me something. No, you can't just jump. The bear was mad about
[2705.45s -> 2737.08s]  the pot. There's music. Well, let's get up here. Red shoe. What is this? Whose shoe is this?
[2738.20s -> 2751.93s]  This is a mushroom? Oh, it's a break mushroom. You shouldn't be slacking off.
[2757.30s -> 2778.01s]  Get back in there, champ. I can't get over there. Can I go down here? I can maybe sneak in this.
[2779.13s -> 2789.34s]  If I hover, I think I can sneak in there. Yeah, I can. I definitely can. Do I even need to?
[2790.14s -> 2799.48s]  I don't think I even need to. What the fuck? Did I just clip through?
[2805.13s -> 2808.50s]  What the fuck are you talking about? Why am I clipping through this?
[2826.46s -> 2841.67s]  Toe. Toe. What? Toe. Toe. Toe. Toe. Toe? Toe. Why is everyone saying toe? I don't get it.
[2843.86s -> 2849.38s]  You're confusing him. Yeah, you are. Very much so. I don't know what you're even talking about.
[2849.38s -> 2858.63s]  Let's go talk to this guy. Oh, someone did a juke with a toe. Okay.
[2859.51s -> 2865.45s]  I get it, I guess. Although I don't. I'm going to pretend I get it.
[2867.21s -> 2868.97s]  Let's talk to the bumming again.
[2891.38s -> 2895.48s]  Will you listen to my story? Yeah.
[2897.00s -> 2899.80s]  It's about the other night.
[2913.35s -> 2917.11s]  Why is the bear attacking? Stop, stop. You're going to break it.
[2918.15s -> 2924.58s]  Okay, I got that. That's the shoe for the girl up there.
[2926.98s -> 2928.18s]  That is what transpired.
[2932.92s -> 2936.04s]  The lovely Princess Pitts hasn't left her castle since then.
[2937.24s -> 2940.20s]  Her bare foot causes her terrible embarrassment, I'm sure.
[2941.88s -> 2943.88s]  I'm very worried about her.
[2947.43s -> 2954.54s]  If you find the red shoe, please let me know. What? You've got the red shoe?
[2955.18s -> 2962.89s]  I've got the red shoe. Come back up. It's really elaborate and probably pain in the
[2962.89s -> 2965.37s]  ass to get in and out of here. I don't know why you didn't ask first.
[2969.03s -> 2982.94s]  Did you find the shoe? There it is. Yes. Hurry up and give it to Princess Pitts.
[2982.94s -> 2986.86s]  I can't go into the castle because my body won't fit. Another one of life's little
[2986.86s -> 2992.86s]  disappointments. I put a flight of stairs in front of the castle. Go ahead and use it.
[2994.62s -> 3005.21s]  Oh, shit. They gave us a way out. What's a button on the back of you do?
[3005.21s -> 3013.94s]  All right, let's charge up and then try to go up to the top of the castle.
[3019.75s -> 3023.51s]  I need an outlet. Where's an outlet? Only one outlet in this whole room.
[3025.66s -> 3057.26s]  It's just bad bedroom design. One outlet. All the way over here. Can you play the piano?
[3057.74s -> 3067.13s]  Is it a battery? Oh, I'm gonna be able to get that. I can't pick those up. Here we go.
[3067.93s -> 3075.70s]  Let's make our way up. This is gonna be a puzzle. Not really. Not that big of a deal.
[3079.08s -> 3089.10s]  Now, what is this? Battery. Double A battery. Okay, more items. Can I jump from here to there?
[3089.74s -> 3095.11s]  Nope. I don't know if this is like Zelda or something where if I got to the edge,
[3095.11s -> 3125.03s]  I just did it. Okay, pull these. And then can I- whoo! Jump onto the heart thing and we float.
[3126.71s -> 3137.38s]  This really is Jump King. What's this? This is where you inserted a double A battery. Ah,
[3146.38s -> 3163.80s]  nice. I want to hear the whole song. I wonder, should I- I was gonna get on his head and then
[3163.80s -> 3170.74s]  we float from here. This game is so cute. It really is. It's just adorable, the whole thing.
[3171.38s -> 3184.02s]  All right, keep going. Dude, I just smoked like two grams. What the fuck is this?
[3185.14s -> 3197.98s]  Dude, I just smoked two grams. No one said that. Yes, they did. He said, man, I just smoked two
[3197.98s -> 3208.76s]  grams. What the fuck? Why? Why? I don't need that info. I don't need- I mean, that's fine, but I
[3208.76s -> 3224.54s]  don't- I don't need that info. Should I go left or right? Go right. Oh, the gosh. The
[3224.54s -> 3265.03s]  the perspective. It was just wrong. Back to the sewer. I didn't want to wait. Bye. Okay, we're
[3265.03s -> 3287.24s]  good. I need another battery. I need another battery. Fuck. Where's there another double A
[3287.24s -> 3342.50s]  battery? A D battery. Shit. Where's there a D battery? Man! I'm gonna have to do it tomorrow.
[3343.14s -> 3356.70s]  Throw the trash away. I need a D battery. I wonder, is that in here? It's probably on the other side.
[3356.70s -> 3364.36s]  I just went the wrong way. I went right instead of left. End of the stream voice.
[3365.96s -> 3375.22s]  I just started like 45 minutes ago. What are you talking about? Oh, because I keep saying
[3375.22s -> 3398.98s]  tomorrow. I'm gonna have to say in the game. Coin. I'm gonna go down the slide too. Cool. You ready?
[3398.98s -> 3407.24s]  Oh, I did the slide wrong. I'm actually- I'm annoyed by that. Okay, water. I gotta get- wait!
[3407.88s -> 3426.49s]  What's in here? Why is this like this? Cat can't distinguish the game and reality.
[3427.45s -> 3436.44s]  Term is an eggplant head. What the hell is that? What's up? What? What is that? What's that thing
[3436.44s -> 3451.59s]  on your- 20. What's this 20? Twitchcon Amsterdam. What? Eggplant head.
[3451.59s -> 3461.03s]  That's what it's like when kids first learn the word eggplant. They start calling each other
[3461.03s -> 3468.39s]  eggplant head. Eggplant head. Eggplant head. It's because they just found out what that word was.
[3468.39s -> 3488.57s]  They ate it like three days ago. Eggplant head. Stop it. Stop calling me that. If German reads
[3488.57s -> 3514.22s]  this out loud, I'll do 20 push-ups and 50 squats. Good luck. Go for it. Back to what we were doing.
[3515.93s -> 3525.61s]  No, I want water. Where do I get water? Can I get it from a sink? My wife ever finds out
[3526.57s -> 3543.19s]  I'm in huge trouble. This should be a safe place. All right. The receipt is in the couch.
[3543.99s -> 3553.05s]  Receipt in couch. I'm going to get it. I'm getting it, dad. I'm going to get that chip right now.
[3553.05s -> 3559.72s]  No. Yeah, I'm going to get that. Wait, I got to- I'm over- I'm too excited to like-
[3560.68s -> 3587.06s]  I'm too excited to snitch on dad. Hold on. There it is. He really doesn't go anywhere
[3587.06s -> 3601.11s]  besides the couch, does he? Let's get the crumbs. Bro! What's wrong, chibi robo? Toy receipt? I have
[3601.11s -> 3607.91s]  no idea what you're talking about, silly robot. Oh, by the way, the room looks really clean today.
[3607.91s -> 3627.86s]  You must have worked so hard. Toy receipt. No, no, no, no, no. You found it. Ew. Well,
[3627.86s -> 3644.23s]  don't tell my wife, all right? Oh, I want to pick the trash up. Why would it be ew? All right,
[3644.23s -> 3657.88s]  we got to go to mom's room at night. We got to show her. Do we have any more of those things?
[3657.88s -> 3679.59s]  I don't have any more of those things. Rings. No. Gone. Man, the news is boring. What a snorefest.
[3679.59s -> 3688.92s]  Hey, chibi. Can you change the channel, buddy? The amount of work it takes for me to change the
[3688.92s -> 3694.60s]  channel on the TV is astronomical. Do you see how small I am and how little- how much is it
[3694.60s -> 3701.78s]  going to take me to do this? It's going to take me so long to do this. I have to go get my ladder.
[3701.78s -> 3709.11s]  You can't just sit up and press a button. Look at what- I want you to watch this whole time.
[3709.99s -> 3722.62s]  Dad. I don't even know where it is. Where's my elevator? I have to go- I'm going to do it.
[3722.62s -> 3736.82s]  It's a happy point. Save the frog. Frog comes after TV. Don't worry. No, it doesn't. Yes,
[3736.82s -> 3742.65s]  it does because I'm currently in the room. Look, let me just change this lazy motherfucker's TV
[3742.65s -> 3760.94s]  channel. Imagine watching this from the couch. Chibi Robo. Yes? Change TV channel. Yes, sir.
[3765.66s -> 3776.97s]  Wow, what's taking this thing so long? Lag. Lag. What do I have for ping?
[3782.36s -> 3801.24s]  This thing sucks. Fuck, man. What the fuck are you doing? Chibi Robo. Yes?
[3802.22s -> 3809.86s]  Change TV channel. Yes, sir. No, no, no. You were already going up. This fucking thing sucks.
[3810.42s -> 3845.27s]  Return this thing. Oh, this won't work. Oh, hooray. I've done it. What the- Hey. Hold it,
[3845.27s -> 3861.43s]  hold it. Whoa. It's Drake Redcrest. Thanks for the- Dad just gave you 19 happy points and $50.
[3862.31s -> 3879.45s]  Fuck you, dad. I'm going back to the news. Wait, no. No, stop. Put it back. Put it back.
[3882.62s -> 3896.50s]  No, no. Keep it on the news. No. You piece of shit. How will I ever be able to change it again?
[3898.68s -> 3910.20s]  No, look at him mocking me. Look at him mocking me. How dare you piece of shit. And then all
[3910.20s -> 3917.16s]  of a sudden from above the screen, smash, a fucking shoe, a foot, crushes Chibi Robo.
[3917.16s -> 3932.12s]  All right. Can I get water out here? I don't think so. All right. I did what dad wanted. Let's plug
[3932.12s -> 3944.52s]  in and let's go back. I love this game. There's so much to do. Bad ending. Yeah. Then it just
[3944.52s -> 3951.77s]  shows dad going into the store with the receipt. Yeah. I don't know what's wrong with it. Okay.
[3951.77s -> 3956.92s]  You just returning it? Yeah. It just stopped working. There's a piece missing, I think.
[3957.88s -> 3971.93s]  Okay. Thank you for the return and exchange. Yeah. Yes. Alex, I'll take every single time
[3971.93s -> 3979.59s]  someone's ever returned something to a store for 500, please. Stop throwing shit at me.
[3980.23s -> 3990.55s]  This happened five times. Yeah. Why are you keeping track of how many times people have thrown
[3991.51s -> 4007.80s]  dinner plates at me? Oh, whatever. Let's go. Because it's funny. All right. We're going to the,
[4008.76s -> 4014.79s]  what do I want to do? We're during the day. We've got to go back to mom at night.
[4014.79s -> 4020.07s]  So I do have access to, I have access to the kitchen because I got the ladder for the kitchen.
[4023.54s -> 4030.02s]  You can give it to her in the day. Oh, you can go to the sink. There's no water in the sink.
[4030.66s -> 4039.45s]  All right. Where's my, uh, the thing that I bought? I just bought it. Where is it?
[4040.09s -> 4050.34s]  Is it, is it, oh, it's up, it's up on top. Why is it up on top? Okay. Well, we have to get up there.
[4051.30s -> 4060.87s]  Hold on. Did I already go up? I think I did this already, but
[4061.43s -> 4071.74s]  worth a shot. It's to reach the spoon. Ah, this tiny husband video is weird.
[4078.70s -> 4091.82s]  Husband, husband video. Why does it have to be a video? What do you mean this?
[4091.82s -> 4108.54s]  Oh, and I guess it is a stream, but tiny husband. Oh, I can think of mom can just put us up there.
[4108.54s -> 4130.15s]  Can't you step on the lever of the toaster? I just tried to go. So did you find the toy receipt?
[4130.79s -> 4144.07s]  This is important. Do we, um, it's do we sit? We'd sit. Yes, we do. Sorry. I mean,
[4144.07s -> 4152.20s]  come on. We got so hot rod. Where's the receipt? The husband, we got to get this free, you know,
[4152.20s -> 4157.51s]  the husband's really, there's a lot of fault has to lay on the husband here.
[4157.67s -> 4169.78s]  She said he spends all their money on toys. I mean, we got to stop that. Another Red Crest toy.
[4170.74s -> 4179.43s]  I told him that these toys are a waste of money. Doesn't he listen? Is he deaf?
[4180.23s -> 4194.95s]  God, my husband is so stupid. Thank you, Chibo. I think that was worth more than 30. Spread the
[4194.95s -> 4207.46s]  happiness. Aren't I spreading sadness and discourse? I've had it with that man. He can do the housework
[4207.46s -> 4215.27s]  himself then. I don't even want to look at him. Spread the happiness. Forget this. I'm going to
[4215.27s -> 4225.70s]  lock myself in my room. You want to explain this? Oh, where did you find that, sweetie?
[4227.06s -> 4231.94s]  Doesn't matter where I got it. Another toy. What is wrong with you? That's it. I've had enough of
[4231.94s -> 4246.94s]  this family. I'm locking myself in the bedroom. Oh man, I'm in a world of hurt. Spreading happiness.
[4247.74s -> 4265.96s]  Happiness being spread. Tearing entire family apart. Oh, shit. Uh, okay. I got to get up here.
[4266.60s -> 4281.21s]  I just need a spoon. It's all your fault. It's not all my fault. They're hiding things from each
[4281.21s -> 4288.47s]  other. They're lying to each other. Like, this was going to fester for another 10 more years?
[4288.47s -> 4312.33s]  No. Wait, can I suck this up? Water. Yeah. All right. Put it away. Is this like soapy water though?
[4312.33s -> 4318.66s]  I'm going to spray soapy water into a frog's mouth. What's all this chemicals in this shit?
[4318.66s -> 4327.83s]  There's like chlorine in this water. Frogs can't have chlorine. All right. Let's do this.
[4344.70s -> 4355.62s]  Chemicals in the water. I mean, it's the frog. I play this game a few nights ago with my daughter.
[4355.62s -> 4361.35s]  My son is playing Chibi-Robo. And in Chibi-Robo, there's frogs. And let me tell you something.
[4363.35s -> 4390.78s]  They had a water system in that game. This is real life. Bug. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop here.
[4390.78s -> 4401.56s]  Stop here. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop it here. There's little robots running around. And that's
[4401.56s -> 4408.54s]  the future. That's our future. That's our future. We're going to Bernie. Whoops. And these little
[4408.54s -> 4414.44s]  robots, they're supposed to be doing housework and cleaning up after you. But it's not happening.
[4414.44s -> 4419.32s]  It's not housework. They're going to take over. These robots are going to get AI and we are dead.
[4419.32s -> 4445.98s]  All of us. Everybody, you know. That's a kid's spoon. Alex Sanders. Bernie Jones.
[4445.98s -> 4450.46s]  I mean, here's the thing. Wall Street. What we're going to have to do is we're going to have to
[4450.46s -> 4457.51s]  break up Wall Street. And let me tell you, I drank water today. A little too much water. And it's
[4457.51s -> 4481.27s]  flooding my lungs, I think. The chemicals that are in this water. They're too much. A demon door.
[4485.37s -> 4501.14s]  Alex, Alex Beetlejuice Sanders. All right. Fuck. But the problem here is it's not about just the
[4501.14s -> 4506.90s]  banks. It's about the fact that I'm living on this bottle. And this bottle, it needs updating. I'll
[4506.90s -> 4512.79s]  tell you. The tree over there hasn't been watered in over three days. Three, four years, I think.
[4513.61s -> 4534.17s]  Nice fucking bottle is what I got to say to that one. Bernie Beetlejuice Alex. I don't even know
[4534.17s -> 4546.55s]  what that was. I got the spoon. Let's plant a plant. And I got the demon door too. I got a demon door.
[4553.69s -> 4561.10s]  How come nobody's made like a Beetlejuice Alex Jones edit? That's perfect. With the music in
[4561.10s -> 4577.24s]  the background, it would be perfect. Let's slow down. You just do it right now. I'm playing
[4577.24s -> 4588.86s]  Chibi-Robo. How does it feel to be 6'10"? Feels pretty good. How about that? Not very many humans
[4588.86s -> 4609.62s]  are that tall. So, I mean, funny. Oh, he's on his way. What? What the fuck are you talking about?
[4609.62s -> 4628.06s]  He's on his way? All right. Let's do some planting. Okay. Now let's plant a seed. Let's plant
[4628.87s -> 4638.71s]  nectar flower seed. Look at this. You can't grow a nectar flower here. Let's put it away.
[4638.71s -> 4675.19s]  Oh, fuck you. Fuck you. Blue flower. Hey, look. Now we need to water it, right? Is this doing
[4675.19s -> 4721.67s]  anything? Well, okay. I can't aim. There's no first person. Oh, sorry. I attacked somebody.
[4721.67s -> 4732.02s]  I just had to attack somebody about something real quick. I'm good. Let's plant. I want to plant
[4732.02s -> 4738.44s]  the other seed. I have two more flowers, right? Yeah. White flower seed. I put them all here.
[4739.40s -> 4761.43s]  Is there a reason to not do this? I guess we can. Does it make mom happy? I'm sure it does.
[4761.43s -> 4781.37s]  Don't jump off the edge. All right, we're good. Okay. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[4781.37s -> 4786.41s]  Now I have water. In fact, I'm going to fill it up completely because I used it.
[4787.13s -> 4795.38s]  There's a lot more water that's in here than I picked up. They're very liberal with that.
[4796.02s -> 4806.81s]  That's like not even a teaspoon of water, so that's cool. Frogs dying. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[4807.37s -> 4831.82s]  I'm not out of... Oh, I am out of time. See you next time. The frog's been dying for two weeks.
[4836.47s -> 4851.53s]  Well, we're about to go rescue the frog. Let's just run in a circle. Whoa. Fight. Fight.
[4872.70s -> 4885.45s]  Holy shit, chibi. Holy shit, chibi. What was that? Chibi. Holy shit, chibi. I love saying that word.
[4901.75s -> 4924.52s]  Yes, save. Save. All right, timer. Run out. I bought the... Yeah, I bought 15 minutes, so
[4927.99s -> 4938.95s]  we have a lot of time. Remember, you're killing my ADHD. I have it too. Don't worry. We both have it.
[4938.95s -> 4947.08s]  We both have it. Don't worry. It's like a disease. Hey, we both have it now. Like what?
[4947.80s -> 4973.74s]  It's like a virus. Gloves. What the fuck? You're very liberal with your assessment of ADHD, guys.
[4974.30s -> 5010.78s]  Okay. Relax. Would you like to save? Sure. Call it out. Liberal ADHD. What the fuck is going on?
[5012.57s -> 5019.93s]  Hey, everybody. Somebody said the word liberal three times. I heard somebody in this chat room.
[5020.97s -> 5028.01s]  It's me, Bernie Sanders. Bernie Alex Jones Sanders. Somebody said the word liberal. I hear you. I said
[5028.01s -> 5035.16s]  I felt it. What are you going to do? Try to take over our entire world? Not on my watch. Not until
[5035.16s -> 5042.15s]  we break up the banks and until we get out. Get back in the box. You're taking me back in the box.
[5042.15s -> 5045.83s]  You did this joke two years ago, German. Now let me tell you about it. Get out of there.
[5086.98s -> 5112.31s]  German, you're scaring Chibi. Fucking music. Oh, shit. I muted the... What? What happened?
[5115.02s -> 5130.22s]  I didn't... I mean, I knew... I thought it was off. I thought I turned it off. Oh, the frog. The frog.
[5130.22s -> 5149.00s]  The frog. We're gonna go, go, go, go, go. Frog, frog, frog, frog, frog. Worst joke of the last
[5149.32s -> 5158.63s]  two decades. What are you talking about? I was just attacked. I was just attacked.
[5159.19s -> 5189.02s]  Was that... That's funny? Attacked by Bernie Jews. Wait, can I dig right there? All right. Yeah,
[5189.02s -> 5194.86s]  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[5194.86s -> 5226.34s]  yeah, yeah. He's still alive. Told you. Here, look what I got. Frida just gave you seven happy points.
[5226.34s -> 5250.26s]  Frida. Again. Spread the happiness. Come on, Frida. Ribbit, Ribbit, Ribbit.
[5250.26s -> 5254.10s]  Thank you for giving me the water I so desperately needed.
[5254.10s -> 5261.61s]  I will commence the nuclear attack on this country. Good day. Oh chat, what the
[5261.61s -> 5281.75s]  fuck? The frog seems to be saying something.
[5281.75s -> 5286.42s]  I don't understand this strange language. Chat, what would you maybe do? What the
[5286.42s -> 5298.95s]  fuck? Frog suit. Well, I'll never take this off. Thank
[5298.95s -> 5305.43s]  you, Ribbit. I'm fine now, thanks to you. My boyfriend's lost in that house and
[5305.43s -> 5310.73s]  I'm tired of waiting around. Now that you're one of us, you can speak
[5310.73s -> 5318.63s]  Ribbit-ese too. Cool, huh? Isn't it just the greatest?
[5318.63s -> 5331.51s]  Now that we can communicate, I have to ask you a favor. If you find him, I want you to
[5331.51s -> 5340.79s]  bring him here. Okay. Super frog. Okay, so what a great
[5340.79s -> 5348.41s]  costume this is. I know where he is. Show Jenny the frog
[5348.41s -> 5355.32s]  suit. Show Jenny the frog suit. I will, after I do some cleaning.
[5355.32s -> 5370.28s]  Who cares about cleaning? This is a frog game. This is a cleaning game with frogs
[5370.28s -> 5373.42s]  in it. Sorry, I have to correct when people are
[5373.42s -> 5400.06s]  wrong. This is a frog cleaning game. Well, it is now.
[5400.06s -> 5424.54s]  All right, let's see what the pose is. That takes... Okay, I'm gonna die.
[5424.54s -> 5444.65s]  Run. Run. Run. Use spoon to dig up the... Yeah, I gotta dig up the bone.
[5444.65s -> 5453.18s]  I'm out of power. I need to plug in. Press Z and wait. Well, I'm out of
[5453.18s -> 5460.28s]  power. I'm gonna die if I do that. No, don't say
[5460.28s -> 5476.25s]  F's. No F's. Yes, I am. F is cancelled.
[5476.25s -> 5488.47s]  Yup. Okay, I will hold down Z now. We'll see what it does. Ready?
[5488.47s -> 5500.22s]  Nothing. You just... That's it. Imagine having a device
[5500.22s -> 5507.27s]  that did one small animatronic movement and needed to take thirty dollars of
[5507.27s -> 5521.78s]  your power bill. This is not efficient at all. Uh, cleaning
[5521.78s -> 5531.32s]  game first. It takes more power to do a single frog
[5531.32s -> 5534.04s]  hop than it is to clean a whole living room.
[5534.04s -> 5556.28s]  I think there's a bug there. Bonus! Happy point bonus is...
[5556.28s -> 5594.04s]  32. Nice. 132 bucks. You gotta keep the house clean otherwise
[5594.04s -> 5598.22s]  people lose their minds. The right one is my favorite. Middle one
[5598.22s -> 5608.55s]  is my favorite. All right, now we're gonna go
[5608.55s -> 5613.51s]  bring the other frog back to life. We'll have to speak frog to the frog
[5613.51s -> 5647.42s]  and bring the frog back here. Feed the frog sand instead of water.
[5647.42s -> 5668.30s]  All right, we need to go to the upstairs. Jenny, what are we gonna do? Your mom is...
[5668.30s -> 5678.63s]  That was what? I thought that was mom again. Mom is what? Your mom is what?
[5678.63s -> 5696.79s]  I gotta get over there. I gotta go. Hurry, save mom. I'm going.
[5696.79s -> 5710.25s]  What should we do, Jenny? Mom is, uh, ribbit ribbit.
[5710.33s -> 5721.00s]  Huh? Wait, that's it. I can look through these slats. That's my smart girl.
[5721.00s -> 5729.10s]  Ribbit. It's no use, kiddo. My face is too big. I can't see inside.
[5729.10s -> 5746.76s]  Give me a hand, Jenny. Oh, Chibi Robo. She locked herself in the bedroom. I'm a
[5746.76s -> 5750.12s]  little worried about her. I need to see what's going on in there.
[5750.12s -> 5755.29s]  I can't see through the slats. I'm sure she'll be happy to see you. She's not mad
[5755.29s -> 5770.49s]  at you. Can you help me out? Hold on. Let's get the fucking paper.
[5775.72s -> 5783.61s]  Cheese crumbs and whatever the hell this is. Book? Oh, well, this is your book.
[5786.42s -> 5791.34s]  All right, let's go. I'm in. I'm in. Go check on my wife and see what she's up
[5791.34s -> 5828.12s]  to. Say you'll do it. I'm begging you. Okay, she's sleeping. Dead frog. Hey,
[5828.12s -> 5869.66s]  you. Get up. Keep her up. Are you still here? What the hell? A Lego dinosaur.
[5883.00s -> 5889.24s]  I hope it has the Rex's voice from Toy Story. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Look at
[5889.24s -> 5902.74s]  the size of that thing. Chibi, what do we do? Goodbye. You're going to leave?
[5903.46s -> 5923.21s]  You're going to leave me? Is mom awake from this? Oh, you're right. My teeth.
[5924.86s -> 5939.62s]  You're made of metal. Goodness gracious. I can't be running around without my teeth.
[5941.74s -> 5950.18s]  Hold on there, you little varmint. I need my teeth. It really is the guy from Toy Story. Here,
[5951.16s -> 5960.41s]  Dinah teeth. Take it. You can have back. Can I have whippersnapper? Give me my teeth.
[5964.30s -> 5979.38s]  Bombers not to bite me. Thanks, Junior. This ain't much, but you go on and take it.
[5980.02s -> 5983.86s]  Dinah gave me more happy points than everybody in the whole house.
[5984.66s -> 5992.25s]  Sorry, I don't need the money. I want the happy points. I mistook you for one of them dang frogs.
[5994.73s -> 6005.78s]  What do you expect? My eyes are going and you was dressed all in green. I guess it was fate that
[6005.78s -> 6021.14s]  brought us together. Stop by if you need anything. You hear? Bye now. Well, we made a new friend.
[6021.14s -> 6059.02s]  It was the frog. We lost the frog. Lening game first. Ease out up. 20, 30 happy points
[6059.02s -> 6063.10s]  every time I do that. That adds up. I've done that dozens of times. It's worth a ton of points.
[6064.06s -> 6076.50s]  What happened? I've got to get back to Frida on the double. Will you take me to the backyard?
[6078.86s -> 6091.27s]  Yes. Really? Truly? I'm counting on you, Ribbit. Not yet.
[6105.03s -> 6122.97s]  Counting on you, losing for dead. I did not. When I find that motherfucker that's doing that,
[6123.85s -> 6128.86s]  I'm going to spray them with water. That's not going to be water in that thing.
[6130.73s -> 6137.61s]  I'm going to go. I'm going to suck up something from the drain and squeeze it. Spray it. All right,
[6137.61s -> 6159.45s]  let's go. Mom? Fantastic. More receipts. So many bills. Oh, look at you dressing up like Jenny.
[6159.45s -> 6163.77s]  Why don't you go show her? I bet she'd get a kick out of it. Very nice. You've been cleaning
[6163.77s -> 6187.08s]  up the house. Thank you, Chibo. All right, we're going to take this off. More receipts, more receipts.
[6187.08s -> 6208.31s]  Oh, my husband must have sent you in here. Oh, well, it's not your fault. But let me tell you
[6209.19s -> 6216.33s]  something. He's not getting off the hook until he's sorry for what he did. Chibo, could you
[6216.33s -> 6225.96s]  give my husband this letter? What's a letter? What do you mean, this letter? Shit. Uh, okay.
[6232.55s -> 6241.16s]  Thank you, Chibo. He has to understand. Okay, I'll give the letter. All right, Frog, let's go.
[6241.16s -> 6245.24s]  Wait, I have to be dressed like a frog. Otherwise, he won't trust me. And I can't talk to him.
[6245.80s -> 6271.58s]  All right, let's go, Frog. Take some of this. Let's go. Okay. Are there breathing holes in my body?
[6272.38s -> 6306.49s]  Put them into the trash? I can't. I don't think that'll even work. All right, let me out. All
[6306.49s -> 6322.20s]  right, Dad. I've got a letter for you. I need him to fish. Dad, are you still out here? Jenny,
[6323.32s -> 6354.10s]  where's Dad? Rivet. Did the evil frog wizard put a curse on you too, Chibi-Robo? Yes. Yeah,
[6354.10s -> 6369.78s]  that's what I thought. Just like me. Looks very good on you. Holy fuck, that's a lot of points.
[6370.42s -> 6387.99s]  I can only speak to other frogs. How do you do, Rabbit? I mean, Rivet. Can I talk to the bear?
[6391.19s -> 6397.74s]  Chibi, thanks for checking on Mom. Looks like Dad's asleep. He'll be up in the morning.
[6403.05s -> 6415.29s]  Everybody's sleeping out here. Why don't you need to go to sleep? You're like three. You need more
[6415.29s -> 6432.73s]  sleep than all of us. You need to be in bed. Hey, look, I can't sleep. I wish everything was all
[6432.73s -> 6469.45s]  better. Jesus. Mm-hmm. It's traumatizing. This is pretty fucked up. It is. All right. Dad's going
[6469.45s -> 6471.69s]  to get up in the morning, which means I don't think I can do anything. Can I wake him up?
[6476.50s -> 6486.87s]  I can't. Okay. Can I do anything else today? I could probably float from, hold on. There's
[6486.87s -> 6501.45s]  other stuff down here that I can get from up here, isn't there? Hey, what are you doing here? Frog.
[6501.45s -> 6517.05s]  Hey, but hold on. What are you doing over here? Hey. Well, all right. Let's go bring the frog to
[6517.05s -> 6543.03s]  the backyard. Okay. Back to the living room, which is over here. Jenny's too close. Oh, okay. That
[6543.03s -> 6557.42s]  makes sense. Have I been to the basement? Yes. I have the charger. I haven't put any money in it,
[6557.42s -> 6568.52s]  though. I currently got a family I'm trying to work out their problems. How is divorce any percent
[6568.52s -> 6592.52s]  coming along? Not sure. A couple of these. That's worth a lot. Ten. Very good. Thirty-nine happy
[6592.52s -> 6600.54s]  points. I got to be in like the top five at this point, right? Have to be. You think I'm going to
[6600.54s -> 6605.74s]  be a Chibi-Robo? I'm going to be top five Chibi-Robo in the world and let a piece of trash sit up here?
[6606.82s -> 6636.84s]  You are mistaken. Sorry. You wish you were top five. Oh, oh. Oh, I am top five. When I go back and
[6636.84s -> 6647.14s]  charge up, you'll see. I'm going to fill this up, though. I'm probably going to need this for
[6647.14s -> 6669.32s]  something. I want a full water syringe. All right, frog. It's time to reunite. I wonder who the worst
[6669.32s -> 6680.33s]  Chibi-Robo is. I don't know. That's a good question. Okay, frog. Here we go. Here comes the reuniting of
[6680.33s -> 6694.60s]  the frogs. Hello, Frida. I have someone. How long is that loser boyfriend of mine going to keep me
[6694.60s -> 6708.49s]  waiting, Ribbit? Honestly. Yeah, I found him. He was lying down on the ground. I think he was
[6708.49s -> 6723.40s]  shit-faced. Frog divorce present. Fred, you're still alive. You sure got yourself into a mess.
[6723.40s -> 6739.91s]  Frida, I'm done for Ribbit. I got mistaken for food and chewed to bits. What did I tell you? That
[6739.91s -> 6748.09s]  house is dangerous. You got hurt because you didn't listen to me, as usual. Don't talk so loudly.
[6749.53s -> 6756.14s]  My head still hurts. You don't know what pain is, my friend, but you're going to find out pretty
[6756.14s -> 6770.01s]  soon. What? Maybe I was better off as a dinosaur snack. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[6770.81s -> 6780.10s]  Sorry if it caused you any trouble. See you later. Wait, wait, was that meant?
[6782.18s -> 6790.07s]  Help me! Help! You just wait for what's in store for you. Holy shit! Do I go in there?
[6790.07s -> 6808.54s]  How do I do help him? Hey! Oh my god! Get out of there! Spreading happiness, as usual. Can I do
[6808.54s -> 6824.44s]  anything right? Everything I do just goes horribly wrong. Should I? Oh, this thing's a dig up over
[6824.44s -> 6866.89s]  here. What is this? Okay. What is it? More digging? The tank? Oh, it's the hidden pirate ship.
[6867.85s -> 6903.94s]  Ah, why don't I just unearth? Good job, you unearthed ghost pirates. Do I hop aboard?
[6903.94s -> 6934.90s]  A ghost problem solved. It's so scary. Can I dig in here? I just like the song. That was cool.
[6934.90s -> 6957.70s]  So I gotta go talk to the pirate again. What else? I'm gonna run out of time. Don't dig too deep. Get
[6957.70s -> 6986.60s]  the bone? Dog bone. Oh, all right. There's bone over here. Really? I can't dig this up? I guess I
[6986.60s -> 7006.98s]  can. Is it up enough for me to grab it? Dog bone. Okay, nice. Give dog bone to the dog?
[7007.70s -> 7034.79s]  Should I have a lot of these flowers? Oh wait, there's nectar in here! Oh! All right, put that
[7034.79s -> 7059.00s]  away. Plant the nectar seed. Come on! Drained all the nectar. All right, I'm gonna be top five.
[7061.98s -> 7069.75s]  At least six. I got a lot of points. Good morning. Let's adjust your point total.
[7070.71s -> 7085.34s]  Oh, well, I made it to nine. Top nine. Citrusoft is sending you a brand new bonus battery. It'll be
[7085.34s -> 7098.98s]  at 200. Yeah! 394 more points. All right, I also have to... I got money and I got scrap.
[7099.94s -> 7119.34s]  Get the backup batteries? I have one already. All right, let's do some scrap. Kitchen bridge,
[7119.34s -> 7123.18s]  living room bridge. A bridge that stretches far placed on top of the bookcase
[7123.18s -> 7130.28s]  or the kitchen one. Place near the planter. Which one of these is more useful?
[7131.24s -> 7145.96s]  One in the kitchen. Chibi-Robo, put your scrap into the recyclotron and then I'm going to dump
[7145.96s -> 7158.39s]  all this money into the battery. Save giga-robo. Yeah, I'm going to put the money in here. I'm
[7158.39s -> 7183.67s]  going to do 2,000 gigawatts. Do you want to charge it? Yes. 2,000. 2,000 kilowatts. Fill it!
[7183.67s -> 7195.99s]  Ooh, that was not very much at all. Did I break it? Something seems a little off, but...
[7196.95s -> 7197.75s]  Oh, well, never mind.
[7206.60s -> 7216.17s]  Okay. Well, I'm going to go pee. I'll be right back. See you guys in like two minutes.
[7216.81s -> 7447.78s]  Can I ask if I just press the unmute button and fucking scream as loud as I could?
[7448.58s -> 7464.71s]  Okay. It's a new day. Time to give dad the letter. How dare you? No, no, no, no. That's not cool.
[7464.71s -> 7475.03s]  That would be so bad. All right, dad, I got a letter for you. Where's dad? Dad not on couch.
[7477.90s -> 7489.40s]  Dad not watching TV on couch. Weird. Is he still upstairs? I mean, it's a cleaning game first.
[7490.36s -> 7548.26s]  I put on my wizard robe for this. What? It's a cleaning game first. It's a cleaning game
[7548.26s -> 7565.30s]  first. Divorce game second. All right. That's right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7565.30s -> 7573.30s]  Four for footprints. These add up. They add up. Guys, doing side quests gives me sometimes like
[7573.30s -> 7599.91s]  12. This adds up like crazy. All right. Charge up. I'm going to go talk to dad. Remember, you
[7599.91s -> 7608.38s]  would do that even if it gave one. Yeah, I would. Yes, I would. Because that's seven to 10 points
[7608.38s -> 7616.76s]  per cleanup. Do that 10 times. You've just made almost entire battery worth. 30% almost.
[7619.19s -> 7624.71s]  What about pirate friend? Yeah, but I mean, priority right now is give the give the letter
[7624.71s -> 7643.03s]  to dad. We're doing main storyline quest here. That's one of my favorite noises. He's being
[7643.03s -> 7652.84s]  frugal. Yeah, come on. This is how I get my points. I level up. Two, four, six, eight, 10,
[7652.84s -> 7661.19s]  12 foot. Like I just did a whole side mission. Like picking up dog hair. You have to read the
[7661.19s -> 7676.01s]  letter first. Why? This letter contains some bad news. Are these papers? Are these like divorce
[7676.01s -> 7702.30s]  papers? No, they're not. Is this game going to go full dark? How'd it go? What'd she say?
[7704.98s -> 7713.40s]  Uh, I mean, this is the chaos route. Release the scurvy splinter and everyone has to like,
[7713.40s -> 7731.26s]  oh, everyone get out. And then, hey, is that what I think it is? It is, isn't it? A love letter.
[7731.26s -> 7742.74s]  Say it is. Thanks little buddy. Uh, the heart is in half. Oh man, this dude's truly clueless.
[7748.41s -> 7757.93s]  I think I'll read this love letter out loud. And then the little girl. Dear dysfunctional
[7757.93s -> 7769.21s]  family. Tao tracks mud all over the house. Jenny thinks she's a frog. And the man of the house
[7770.68s -> 7782.68s]  isn't man enough to find another job. Well, I've had enough. I'm sorry, but you've pushed me to the
[7782.68s -> 7800.50s]  edge. The only option I've got left is divorce. Divorce. Ribbit. No.
[7800.50s -> 7815.13s]  No. I got no time to lose. I gotta cook, clean the house, and fix stuff. I have to win her back.
[7816.39s -> 7825.19s]  Let's go, Jenny. Come on, Tao. Hurry. Down the stairs. She's huge. She's huge.
[7832.04s -> 7855.88s]  Arf. Oh my god. She's, she's huge. She grew. She's as big as dad. What? Okay. Um, congratulations.
[7859.42s -> 7876.84s]  She's like 26. What? No. I've never seen him in the same room before. That's the first I've ever
[7876.84s -> 7888.44s]  seen him in the same room. No, but wasn't she kneeling on the ground? Wait, what? How have I
[7888.44s -> 7908.38s]  not figured this out? She's like six feet tall. She's still like two years old. Jenny's in her
[7908.46s -> 7946.17s]  thirties. All right, let's go. Uh, let's go down and see what they're doing. To the kitchen. Yes,
[7946.17s -> 7965.94s]  to the kitchen. Yes. Yes. Yes. I got, I just got a bridge for the kitchen, right? Yes. To the base.
[7965.94s -> 7974.60s]  Hold on. Go see mom. I know, one thing at a time. I want to see what they're doing. I got a bridge.
[7974.60s -> 7987.22s]  I got a bridge in the kitchen. I got to bring back the guy's pirate ship. All right. Hold on.
[7987.22s -> 7991.62s]  Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me talk to mom first. I mean, I'm right here.
[7991.62s -> 8038.17s]  Might as well. Where's it? There it is. Climb. Blow. Wait, I don't know why I just thought I
[8038.17s -> 8052.18s]  could just open the door. I'm an idiot. All right, let's go. How much power does a teleporter cost?
[8052.18s -> 8064.34s]  A lot. I can't believe I got timed out for typing this TP noise.
[8073.93s -> 8113.40s]  And is it not like this? Well, how many times did you write it? Not enough. Jesus. Dog tracks
[8113.40s -> 8122.17s]  mud in the house as mom tracks huge prints behind a locked door. You know what? Yeah. How
[8122.17s -> 8142.07s]  did these get here? That's bullshit. Hmm. Yes. It's happened seven times. I still don't know who's
[8142.07s -> 8156.63s]  throwing those at. I don't know why they're doing. Okay. Mom, let's talk. Let's see. Delivered my
[8156.63s -> 8170.74s]  letter. Oh, look at you. Ah, I'm dressed like this. I'm going to. I've been picking up garbage
[8170.82s -> 8181.38s]  around the house. 10 happy points. That's as much as I get more cleaning up three footprints.
[8181.38s -> 8200.33s]  Just saying. That's a bonus for cleaning up those footprints. Yes, I delivered the letter.
[8200.33s -> 8205.40s]  I think you deserve a reward for being just the smartest little robot ever.
[8206.36s -> 8217.21s]  Holy shit. That is a big one. 120 points. I never thought boycotting all my housework would be this
[8217.21s -> 8226.58s]  boring. I wish there was something I could do. Wait, I know. I haven't sewn for ages. I think
[8226.58s -> 8230.98s]  I'll get out of the old sewing kit for a change. Since you've been working so hard and have been
[8230.98s -> 8237.06s]  such a good bot, I'll make something nice and cozy just for you. Ooh. Give me a little time.
[8237.06s -> 8268.71s]  Okay. All right. Mom, what's the code for the briefcase? 666. Just a minute, Chibo.
[8270.76s -> 8273.56s]  Being so tiny must make things awfully hard for you. Let me give you a hand.
[8275.61s -> 8281.59s]  Here you go. I know you're small, but you do your best. Oh, thanks. You just saved me some time.
[8282.15s -> 8300.87s]  Very nice of you, mom. All right. Now we're going to go down to the basement and then back. No,
[8300.87s -> 8334.06s]  we're not. Get off me. All right. Do we have enough? Oh, not enough. We're good. All right.
[8334.06s -> 8349.08s]  Back downstairs. Wait. I see a stain that I haven't gotten. Two of them actually. Okay. Wait. A little
[8349.08s -> 8354.52s]  bit more over here. Yep. I think that's just artifacting. No, these are scuff marks.
[8355.32s -> 8365.32s]  Probably from dad. Scuff marks are worth four points. Scuff marks on a carpet.
[8377.64s -> 8389.96s]  Scuffed stream. It's from the car peeling out. Got a cleaning bonus. I think I'm pretty close
[8389.96s -> 8424.86s]  to another rank up, right? Look at all this dirt. I just can't have this. Ah! Wait, hold on.
[8430.06s -> 8439.77s]  It's your mom. I can't clean on surfaces. Why can I not clean these? I can't scrub on surfaces in
[8439.77s -> 8447.54s]  front of me. Only on the ground. I missed one. No, I didn't. I know. I'm going over here.
[8449.11s -> 8498.18s]  Water? Oh. Well, I don't have water. I have nectar. Do I have enough power to do this? Yeah. He had
[8498.18s -> 8527.02s]  to charge his eyelids. How much power does it take to wink? Oh, let's see. How many? Okay.
[8527.02s -> 8534.44s]  You get 2,000 calories in a day. Just sitting here breathing is about... Let's see. Oh, let's pause
[8534.44s -> 8542.84s]  for a second. Oh, I'm actually curious about this. So how many calories do you burn blinking?
[8547.03s -> 8561.86s]  Do you burn calories when you blink? Okay. Do you lose weight when you blink? What?
[8563.59s -> 8572.15s]  How many calories do you burn when you fart? A popular internet claim from 2015 said that
[8572.15s -> 8579.35s]  one fart burned 67 calories and that farting 52 times a day would burn a pound of fat.
[8580.34s -> 8597.90s]  What a bunch of bullshit. Okay, so if you blink... All right, so by doing nothing...
[8603.93s -> 8613.46s]  So it's probably like two tenths of a calorie to blink. So two tenths of one
[8613.46s -> 8638.26s]  calorie kilowatt. Don't get banned by doing that noise. 60 calories. So you're telling me
[8638.26s -> 8642.74s]  that if you go on like... Oh no, this is going to be gross, but we're talking. This is real life.
[8643.96s -> 8651.66s]  If you go on like a farting spree over the course of like an hour, it's going to burn
[8651.66s -> 8658.55s]  like a thousand calories? Who the fuck wrote that? All right, I want to go in the kitchen.
[8658.55s -> 8686.86s]  I want to see the bridge. I want to see what they're doing. Uh-oh, small spiders. He starved
[8686.86s -> 8708.14s]  to death because he farted too many times in a row. That's so disgusting. Gross. Just, just gross.
[8709.74s -> 8738.66s]  Come on, I don't want any more random Pokemon battles. I've got cleaning to do. Where's the
[8738.66s -> 8764.39s]  family? Why is nobody to be found? Holy shit, look at all this dirt. I imagine somebody opening the
[8764.39s -> 8769.98s]  chat because they like Chibi-Robo. The first time they're here and they look at this fucking chat
[8769.98s -> 8774.38s]  room and they see fart redeemed. Actual fart. Fart redeemed. Fart redeemed. It would just be like...
[8776.52s -> 8779.72s]  Like you just, you just pop the chat out and minimize it at that point, I think.
[8780.68s -> 8806.68s]  So you don't have it. We just close the tab. A good bonus. Can I buy the car? Yeah, and I haven't been
[8806.68s -> 8812.18s]  able to use it. I own the car and I can't even use it. I don't know what to do with it.
[8814.78s -> 8821.67s]  Take the ghost costume off. Take the... Got you. Sorry, I had to do that one more time before I
[8822.23s -> 8836.87s]  took it off. So much to do. Look at this. So much dirt on the ground. Oh yeah, there's another
[8836.87s -> 8851.22s]  training regimen with the eggs, right? Yeah, I go back there after I do the boat. 39 more points.
[8851.22s -> 8901.88s]  I'm raking it in. All right, let's go to the ship. How many side quests? The bridge. Where's the
[8901.88s -> 8907.93s]  bridge? Yeah, I don't have enough time. I have enough time to do the bridge. Wait, wait, wait.
[8907.93s -> 8915.02s]  All right, all right, all right. Look at all this dirt. No, fuck the dirt. Forget it. Oh, it's so
[8915.02s -> 8932.26s]  easy. No, it's not. I want to do the bridge. Think about how much dirt. I haven't done it in so long.
[8932.26s -> 8942.46s]  Think about how much junk is up in the, uh, in the fan. Let me check the bridge out because I've
[8942.46s -> 8951.37s]  invested a lot of money into making the kitchen traversable. Where's the bridge? Right there.
[8951.37s -> 8955.58s]  Okay. I'm gonna run out of time, but I still want to see it. What about the flowers? I haven't
[8955.58s -> 8970.81s]  checked down those either. Oh, look, they're little sprouts. It's a bud, chibi robo. Wow.
[8974.74s -> 8979.69s]  All right, turn it on. Do you want to know how to use the bridge utility bot?
[8982.44s -> 8987.48s]  Insert your plug to unfold the bridge, and you want to shorten it, just tilt down.
[8988.60s -> 8994.36s]  Change the bridge's direction, plug in the side. Push or pull the utility bot freely,
[8994.36s -> 9000.04s]  so try moving the utility bot to a different location. All right, what do I want to go from
[9000.04s -> 9043.43s]  here? Ah, that way. Ooh. Ooh. Oh my goodness. What have you done? It really is. Or it's...
[9044.95s -> 9064.62s]  I thought the bridge was complete, and it wasn't. This is a stranding type game. Death stranding.
[9064.62s -> 9075.35s]  This is a stranding. All right, this is happening way more frequently. It's happened nine times in
[9076.54s -> 9083.42s]  10 hours of gameplay. It's happened like four times in the last one hour. Why is it happening
[9083.42s -> 9100.22s]  in more frequency? No, whatever. I can... I'll come back. There's not enough time in the day
[9101.10s -> 9128.73s]  to do anything. I'm definitely like eight or seven. The seventh best robo? Eight. Making
[9128.73s -> 9145.43s]  into the top eight. More power. That's a lot. That's a huge increase. 230. That's huge.
[9150.62s -> 9156.33s]  Oh, chibi robo is a new product available for the online store.
[9157.29s -> 9160.89s]  Let's see here. Ah, there. It's some new chibi gear. They call it chibi radar.
[9161.69s -> 9165.32s]  With one of those, you'd be able to find things not visible to the naked eye.
[9166.84s -> 9169.08s]  You have to buy it and see if it's true. Okay, yeah. Let's go.
[9171.24s -> 9203.34s]  Well, it depends on how much it is. Okay, seeds. Chibi radar. I can't afford it.
[9204.06s -> 9209.02s]  Let you see things that are hidden from normal view. Okay, I'll buy that next.
[9210.06s -> 9224.41s]  I have enough to do this. Living room bridge. Yeah, I can do this. Let's do it. Does Jerma ever
[9224.41s -> 9239.70s]  scream? Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes. Maybe like once. It's a utility bot. Where's this going on
[9239.70s -> 9255.86s]  the bookcase? Set it out in the living room. All right. I want to go to the basement, too.
[9256.74s -> 9268.26s]  But we just... Okay, where is it? Because there's other stuff in here that I didn't get.
[9269.38s -> 9295.51s]  Frog ring up there. Where is it? I gotta get higher. Where's this bridge? Top of the TV,
[9295.51s -> 9306.76s]  you know? Oh, it's over there. But I can't... Can I get up there yet? I think I can, right?
[9307.72s -> 9338.89s]  Hold on. Let me push this back. Ah, a Joop classic. Nice. All right. Can this go any higher?
[9345.91s -> 9356.30s]  No, it can't. It's pronounced jump. Can you imagine going into a stream and correcting
[9356.30s -> 9362.22s]  somebody on their own thing that they created? Can you imagine the scenario where you do that?
[9363.26s -> 9378.42s]  What's the scenario where you do that? When you look through a telescope and you see the beautiful,
[9378.42s -> 9386.74s]  big, beautiful, huge planet known as Juppiter. Yeah. Juppiter. It's the biggest planet we have
[9386.74s -> 9403.72s]  in our solar system. It's huge. All right. Oh, I can get this. No, stop picking up the cord.
[9403.72s -> 9419.42s]  I wish there was a way I could make it so I don't pick the cord up. Let's get that frog ring more.
[9419.42s -> 9433.82s]  Okay. I was wondering how to get this for the longest time, and now we got it.
[9434.62s -> 9466.07s]  Well, now I know how to get over there. Slow, slow, slow. All right. Now we just drop down to
[9466.07s -> 9496.97s]  here. Nice. Demon door. Okay. And I can climb on that too? Let's do this first. Good chunk of
[9496.97s -> 9509.38s]  change. It's going to bring me to the ceiling? Oh, man. We're up pretty high. All right. Hold on.
[9510.26s -> 9522.42s]  This is... I'm all the way to the top. Okay. What's up here? I could go this way and go over there.
[9523.88s -> 9532.65s]  Or what do I want to do up here? Is there anything that's super high up that I haven't gotten? I
[9532.65s -> 9550.55s]  guess over there. And here. All right. Let's just walk around. I don't fall, right? Okay. As long
[9550.55s -> 9560.06s]  as I'm careful. Can I go in here? Fall and float into this? But is there anything even over there?
[9560.06s -> 9576.36s]  There's nothing even there. I don't think there's any reason to do that. All right. There's a space
[9576.36s -> 9591.50s]  over this way. What is this? This is a weird spot. Oh! Right there. Okay. I can fall from there and
[9591.50s -> 9598.01s]  float into the demon door. I could also... Yeah. That's... And then I got everything.
[9598.73s -> 9605.93s]  I've not missed one thing in this room at that point. All right. Let's keep the walk. I'm gonna...
[9605.93s -> 9613.24s]  No, I don't want to take the drop door out. Is the demon door under me? Oh, wait. Isn't
[9613.24s -> 9623.83s]  the one like... There's one right... Did I get this one? I got this one already! Wow. I knew I got
[9623.83s -> 9628.62s]  this one already. I knew I got this one already. Oh, I got it already. I knew it. I was like,
[9629.18s -> 9651.62s]  Oh, baited. It's all right. I can get right back up there. I knew it too. I knew it. All right. Charge
[9651.62s -> 9705.69s]  up. No save. What happens at a hundred charges? The battery explodes. Same deal. Climb and then
[9705.69s -> 9730.52s]  run along the wall and get the secret demon door. Camera. Float. All right. Wait. Maybe something
[9730.52s -> 9739.11s]  behind the picture of... Maybe there was... I don't know. Maybe it's something behind there.
[9739.75s -> 9757.50s]  What's the fastest way? Get to... I think they're both equally slow. We got to get over there.
[9758.06s -> 9769.80s]  We're just gonna have to run this way. All right. Let's go. All the way in the whole wall.
[9771.61s -> 9801.58s]  Just run. Yep. Where is it? No. Where is it? It's underneath. It's like right here, right?
[9811.35s -> 9827.91s]  Okay. Isn't it right here? It's right here, isn't it? Where is this thing?
[9828.55s -> 9847.94s]  Did I pass it? No, it's right there. It's right there. Okay. I just got to get on top of this
[9850.31s -> 9871.05s]  and then float into here. Aha! This is the last door that's in here. I think, right? I can check
[9871.05s -> 9887.05s]  the... Let me see. Eight out of nine. Who is the ninth one? There's one more. Eight out of nine.
[9887.05s -> 9891.82s]  It's probably hidden somewhere. It's probably hidden. Yeah. I probably need that device.
[9891.82s -> 9901.86s]  All right. Let's go. All right. What's next on the list? We're going to
[9903.62s -> 9914.07s]  the basement. The basement is into the foyer and then basement. Actually, I want to do the... Yeah.
[9914.07s -> 9920.42s]  Let's go this way. I want to do this first. German, did you read this important message? I didn't.
[9921.24s -> 9930.97s]  It was very important. I'm so glad that you brought it to my attention. All right. Let's
[9930.97s -> 9951.32s]  go talk to the beans or the eggs, whatever they are. Private Vegas reporting with duty. Uh-huh.
[9951.96s -> 9958.30s]  Sarge has been a tough egg to crack lately. All I want to do is race cars.
[9959.10s -> 9964.94s]  Maybe I'll drive away and go AWOL. Tag me when German lies. What the fuck is going on here?
[9965.50s -> 9977.67s]  What did I lie about? What are you doing? What was my lie? I didn't lie. Tell me the lie. What was
[9977.67s -> 9993.45s]  the lie? Let me know when you want this to stop. Yeah. There was nothing there. He didn't like the
[9993.45s -> 10006.25s]  message. A lot about Rain World. All right. Enough with the Rain World. Can we move on
[10006.25s -> 10022.95s]  from Rain World? It's a fun game. All right. Where's the captain? I want to do this mission,
[10022.95s -> 10037.61s]  whatever it is. Come back to it in like a month or two. All right. Here come the timeouts.
[10038.25s -> 10044.76s]  I cannot guarantee you will not be timed out if you continue to spam that.
[10049.42s -> 10059.59s]  Uh-oh. MonkaW. What is MonkaW? All right. Basement. Basement. Let's go get this guy's ship back.
[10059.59s -> 10085.53s]  Enable it and find out. No. I don't need to. What are the music? Please do. It's better. Isn't it
[10085.53s -> 10103.98s]  just... Okay. It's GermaFear and GermaMars, right? That's what it is. Oh, we just had a shitload of
[10103.98s -> 10118.07s]  subs coming. That's a lot of subs. GermaSucks gave 50 community subs. Thank you, GermaSucks.
[10119.72s -> 10128.44s]  That's a heavy, heavy full bag of community subscriptions. You just dumped it in front of
[10128.44s -> 10135.54s]  everybody. Thanks a lot. It's a lot of money. That's a cat puke noise, especially for you.
[10136.34s -> 10150.89s]  Thanks for the monumental amount of subscriptions. There's a new GeForce driver for your information.
[10150.89s -> 10167.16s]  All right. Wait, why do I have to? This is going... Is it for the GameCube? Shit, I gotta update my
[10167.16s -> 10174.49s]  GeForce GameCube driver. Okay, what was actually in the Wii? It was ATI, wasn't it? Yeah, the Wii
[10174.49s -> 10195.74s]  was ATI. So it was GameCube. What does everybody have now? Like for instance, what is in the Switch?
[10197.72s -> 10207.11s]  Is it an ATI still? Is it Nvidia? What's in the Switch? What's in the Xbox One? What's in the PS4?
[10207.11s -> 10213.75s]  Is it all in video? Does anybody have ATI anymore? All right. Okay. Let's talk to this guy and give
[10213.75s -> 10227.80s]  him his... Hold on. Xbox is AMD. Yes, for an Xbox are AMD. I'm pretty sure.
[10233.14s -> 10240.84s]  It's good to see you. It's been long and long, hasn't it? So you've come to hear this old salt
[10240.84s -> 10254.26s]  tale, have you? No, but I'm sure. All right, sit you back and get ready for a whale of a tale.
[10254.26s -> 10264.44s]  Hold on. I'm here to keep my promise too. Ahoy there, squid bait. You're looking ship shaped today.
[10264.44s -> 10272.01s]  Squid bait? Squid bait! Hi squid bait. Now simmer down. What I'm about to tell you
[10272.01s -> 10296.28s]  happened many years ago when Twirl was young. I've got a loading screen for this. A big coin.
[10298.60s -> 10303.16s]  That fateful day I found a doubloon gleaming like a wee lassie's eyes.
[10305.54s -> 10314.66s]  And the salty scourge of the seas that I was. I decided to seize this shiny treasure from
[10314.66s -> 10324.26s]  myself. Oh, what a pretty treasure it was. However, the Sandersons were so poor he could
[10324.26s -> 10332.86s]  hear their bellies rumbling like thunder. Giga-Robo blamed himself for their troubles.
[10333.42s -> 10342.98s]  Aye, he did. Every pirate swears to be as evil as a barnacle in bed. It be our code.
[10346.12s -> 10354.65s]  But I couldn't even steal one measly doubloon. Ah, a foul humiliation it was. As ye know pirates
[10354.65s -> 10360.17s]  who aren't evil end up at theme parks. It be terrifying. That's pretty funny.
[10362.01s -> 10372.31s]  I hid me ship and confined myself in the briny dark basement. Your the Sanders be out of moolah
[10372.31s -> 10391.61s]  and can't be buying food. I'm betting they be dead. Wait, like now? They're dead? Huh? Actually,
[10391.61s -> 10396.89s]  the Sanderson family is doing just fine. They may not be rich but they were at least able to buy us.
[10397.85s -> 10401.13s]  And were not exactly bargain basement items if I do say so myself.
[10406.73s -> 10417.42s]  What's that ye be saying? So they'd not have been troubled if I'd claimed the moolah I foundish me
[10417.42s -> 10422.74s]  on? I heard that Mr. Sanderson hasn't been working and finances are kind of tight.
[10423.46s -> 10425.75s]  But if it's just a little it's not a problem.
[10429.85s -> 10437.59s]  You know what this means. I'm no longer bound to this dank backwater. This treasure in this house
[10438.15s -> 10453.83s]  that is and I means to find it. What's the main sale me hearties? Main sale? Oh right it's I have
[10453.83s -> 10463.80s]  it. I have to give it to you. Don't you need a ship first? Shiver me timbers I forgot I've got
[10463.80s -> 10473.61s]  no ship. This is the quest we just got put on and I have it already. I put me ship in a dry dock so
[10473.61s -> 10482.95s]  as to keep her safe but me head's full of fog and me ship's lost. You're me only hope chibi I want
[10482.95s -> 10495.34s]  you to find me ship and bring her home. I've got a surprise for you. Stop ad-living. What? I'm going
[10495.34s -> 10505.13s]  off script. Who cares? What? I'm going off script for a few words like any real actor does. You know
[10505.13s -> 10509.21s]  how many lines you've heard in movies that were not scripted turned out to be the most classic
[10509.21s -> 10514.95s]  things you've heard on screen? A pirate in need is a pirate who gets what he wants.
[10517.78s -> 10524.71s]  That's the pirate's code you see. Doesn't seem right somehow. Hmm don't think so eh?
[10525.43s -> 10537.02s]  You fancy yourself a great thinker don't you? You fly and bucket a bitch. If you're half as keen
[10537.02s -> 10543.18s]  as you think you'll keep your blowhole shut. Pirates are not accustomed to waiting now go
[10543.18s -> 10557.30s]  find me ship. Yes yes sir uh captain captain sir. Let's go look for the ship chibi. We'll go
[10557.30s -> 10562.22s]  ahead and scout around but now that he's gone let me just talk about how I wish I just don't
[10562.22s -> 10566.78s]  want him fucking following me around anymore. I have your ship but I don't want to tell him.
[10566.78s -> 10575.14s]  I'm just gonna let him go do that for a while. You want to let go hang out? What's that chibi?
[10575.14s -> 10601.69s]  Have you found me long lost ship already? I have the scurvy splinter. It's so big. Yeah it is.
[10602.65s -> 10609.34s]  Aha so I'm assuming we can fly around in this thing.
[10614.50s -> 10622.89s]  Yes it'd be mine ye floating kelp cube. That's me scurvy splinter. Me ship you've earned me thanks.
[10622.89s -> 10628.63s]  It's gonna be a lot of happy points. Captain Plankbeard just gave you 66 happy points.
[10633.74s -> 10639.86s]  Spread the happiness. There's treasure awaiting and me thinks I'll be getting me some.
[10644.12s -> 10645.96s]  All right so have we completed his quest line?
[10649.54s -> 10660.14s]  It says there's treasure awaiting. Anchors away me hearties. Probably needs power.
[10661.26s -> 10666.12s]  We have to have a new battery charge for grandpa's fucking rowboat.
[10670.14s -> 10673.26s]  Barnacles and bilge pumps. I've got no blasted crew.
[10673.90s -> 10689.43s]  Oh hi then there's only one thing to do. I need you to find me some brave lads who yearn for a
[10689.43s -> 10703.26s]  life of swashbuckling adventure. If you find me four men brave and true I'll have no choice but
[10703.26s -> 10709.16s]  to give you me treasure map. Got it. One pirate crew coming up. Get the eggs would probably do
[10709.16s -> 10716.18s]  it right. Need four crewmen. Courage me lads. Courage. Probably the dinosaur.
[10717.22s -> 10734.86s]  One of the eggs. The dinosaur. What about you? It's probably yeah it's definitely the eggs.
[10734.86s -> 10762.97s]  I am. Here we go. Okay so the next order of business. It's gonna be a new day.
[10763.85s -> 10769.37s]  We gotta go check out where's the family. We gotta go check up on what the family's doing.
[10774.68s -> 10781.43s]  Valley the princess. We gotta go climb the tower. Right right right. Yeah that's true.
[10782.39s -> 10787.13s]  All right we have the tower with the shoe. We have the family doing whatever the hell the family's
[10787.13s -> 10796.14s]  doing. Wherever they are. We're doing chores. I haven't seen them in any of the rooms. Let's
[10796.14s -> 10806.66s]  go climb the tower. We'll do that tomorrow. Maybe I can recruit somebody up here. What does it mean
[10806.66s -> 10815.82s]  if your computer says um it means i would turn it off and check to see if potentially one of the
[10815.82s -> 10822.06s]  fans is spinning and hitting something in your case that's a very easy fix i would check that
[10822.06s -> 10829.80s]  first uh if not then i would be careful with the potential messed up power supply um i wish you
[10829.80s -> 10836.89s]  got to be careful with that though electricity don't fuck with electricity go check you want
[10836.97s -> 10845.32s]  to begin jungle training um do i have enough time for this no it could be an ssd dying
[10845.32s -> 10865.24s]  yep a quiet time with television what do you do if your computer is just a pile of rocks
[10866.44s -> 10871.00s]  um somebody has convinced you that your computer is a pile of rocks but behind the big rock
[10871.64s -> 10876.36s]  there's a small probably form factor pc that's behind it plugged into the wall and then plugged
[10876.36s -> 10881.48s]  into a monitor so somebody's been lying to you for a long time i don't know what your situation
[10881.48s -> 10896.26s]  is wherever you are still rank eight check the seasoning and the garlic salt may have dried up
[10900.34s -> 10903.46s]  maybe the rock is the case now that's actually kind of cool
[10905.05s -> 10908.65s]  carve out of this in the middle of a rock and have your components in there
[10912.20s -> 10920.63s]  i think that would be pretty bad for heat conduction flintstone case how is that cool
[10921.35s -> 10928.31s]  i don't know people dunk their motherboards in oil in a like a fish tank without any fish in it
[10928.87s -> 10937.70s]  people do all kinds of weird shit with their computer setups i think i'm gonna buy
[10938.58s -> 10950.39s]  wait do i have enough i do bedroom bridge bedroom basement warp works here from place to place
[10952.31s -> 10956.79s]  basement warp bedroom bridge bridge that stretches far placed on the ceiling beam yep
[10957.75s -> 10969.58s]  yeah let's see i'm gonna get the radar too
[10981.85s -> 10993.77s]  okay do i have enough for the radar what was 1700 gb radar lets you see things that
[10993.77s -> 11019.58s]  are hidden from normal view buy it upgrade give it up gb robo let's go
[11028.65s -> 11038.30s]  let's test it see how it works gb radar um how does it work
[11041.42s -> 11052.04s]  points in the direction of something hidden uses power does something hidden back here

[11237.51s -> 11262.49s]  this is now uh an issue this is an omega f oh it's because i'm playing halo hey get off halo
[11262.49s -> 11274.33s]  stop playing halo let's wait this out for a little bit i'm gonna sit in the corner i'm gonna pause
[11274.33s -> 11278.41s]  this i'm gonna pause it so there's no movement on the screen here ready i'll this is how you
[11278.41s -> 11291.51s]  this is how you work with this scenario so black screen requires no rendering stop all movement on
[11291.51s -> 11314.41s]  screen stop playing halo well hmm i'm at 1000k up right now oh this is bad we're going even lower

[11507.22s -> 11520.95s]  let's give it some more frame data i think we're okay right a little that's kind of a major
[11521.99s -> 11532.50s]  let's hope that doesn't happen again because that just like kind of killed the stream for like
[11533.30s -> 11540.31s]  oh five minutes but let's keep going i got i'm monitoring it over here let's see if it happens
