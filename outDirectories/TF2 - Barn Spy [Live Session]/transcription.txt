[5.37s -> 14.25s]  Hey what's going on everybody? Jerma here with a live spy gameplay commentary currently on Barnblitz.
[14.98s -> 22.49s]  So welcome. Just gonna jump in play some TF2 and I'll show you how to deal with a bunch of blue
[22.49s -> 31.24s]  metanaries. Oh all right let's play let's play let's play let's play come on come on just don't even
[31.24s -> 39.03s]  realize that there's a spy waiting for this heavy to turn the corner and get him oh oh oh oh oh oh
[39.11s -> 43.43s]  change change god i feel like it's been like a million years since i played spy especially
[43.43s -> 49.03s]  like live and being recorded so let's see how this goes pattern opportunity it's okay i still got it
[49.75s -> 54.63s]  and i had another opportunity it's okay i got that one too it's okay just chill out everyone
[54.63s -> 59.93s]  chill just chill out back here so that sniper is going for you he knows the changed disguise go
[59.93s -> 68.76s]  to a scout hide in the in the bush uh i should probably move here damn it this is bad this is
[69.48s -> 77.64s]  real bad actually not really i'm in a not terrible position because there's a i say that as a spy
[77.64s -> 86.28s]  okay i haven't really had an opportunity to say any words but yes the word i will say is yes at
[86.28s -> 94.97s]  the moment apparently you again where are you please don't tell me i'm not going to get that
[95.61s -> 104.58s]  where is he here i feel like he's dead ringering is that another one all i'm doing is reacting
[104.58s -> 111.80s]  i might be able to get this pyro and in fact we'll hopefully get couple here
[111.80s -> 118.55s]  there's spy checking which is a good opportunity for some kills
[120.89s -> 129.77s]  ah no no no no no no no get me out of there the shield spy never dies he always finds
[129.77s -> 136.76s]  your way does something spawn here i forget well it doesn't really matter because i'm in full
[136.76s -> 143.27s]  health anyways but something to talk about something to talk about i'll talk about something
[143.27s -> 152.58s]  in this video what the fuck is that is that what is that could i just see that shadow of the of a
[152.58s -> 163.40s]  spy i did yeah i could he had the same hat on that was really weird uh anyways halloween's coming up
[163.40s -> 171.77s]  and i have a halloween video that hopefully is going to get done and hopefully people think is
[171.77s -> 179.46s]  interesting and i'm not going to give you i'll give you one hint it has to do with iconic video
[179.46s -> 186.02s]  game characters as there's your hint what the fuck am i doing why did i just do that i just
[186.02s -> 190.68s]  jumped right down to everybody's face that was stupid i should get off of this why am i still
[190.68s -> 201.58s]  sniper that's very obvious oh shit hopefully he doesn't know he didn't good very very good
[201.58s -> 210.04s]  still alive too which is somewhat remarkable don't that yeah yeah yeah yeah you all know
[210.04s -> 215.16s]  yeah or do you okay well now you obviously know because i picked up the health
[215.16s -> 224.79s]  on the ammo i got like all this stuff hi hello he's gonna get killed by this
[227.83s -> 233.78s]  no what is i'm i'm bumping into sentries what am i bumping into what's even happening
[237.83s -> 242.92s]  i need a plan of action here that plan of action is going to be just run straight at them
[242.92s -> 247.77s]  that's a pretty good idea right yeah apparently it was a really good idea
[247.77s -> 253.42s]  because i made it out of that no i didn't no i didn't actually thanks for the help you just
[253.42s -> 256.70s]  like helped me get back up here i need to like do i haven't got to kill in like two straight
[256.70s -> 264.90s]  minutes i'm probably i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead son of a bitch son of a bitch come here
[268.60s -> 278.66s]  i did it do not kill me i'm not your enemy i am not your enemy now let's change to pyro
[282.10s -> 289.18s]  please don't hear that thank you for not hearing that what do you got that's a crit that's great
[289.18s -> 296.47s]  don't want to die from a crit still alive dude this is that i remember when i mentioned in the
[296.47s -> 302.12s]  beginning that i haven't played spy in a while like live don't ask me why i'm doing fairly
[302.12s -> 312.70s]  decently i haven't died this is just must be some type of fluke no where is he no don't shoot me
[312.70s -> 316.18s]  i will get you with this headshot when you turn when you come around this corner there to see
[316.18s -> 322.15s]  that do you see that i got him i got him on my head damn it somebody will finish him off no they
[322.15s -> 331.67s]  won't i will i will i don't even care i do care what am i talking about this is where we die
[331.67s -> 337.06s]  because i'm standing and totally still like a fucking idiot with the man melted the guy
[337.06s -> 346.50s]  man melted me and i died don't let him get it don't let him get it do not let them get this
[346.50s -> 354.34s]  under any circumstances get out of my way get out of my i don't want you to see me can i still get
[354.34s -> 366.57s]  it okay hold back hold back here hold back hold back i'm just a pyro just a pyro all right we're
[366.65s -> 371.45s]  okay that guy's gonna get backstabbed no he's he's gonna freak out and he's gonna turn to kill that
[371.45s -> 378.95s]  spy thinking that i'm not a spy i will end up getting the kill oh that's really really annoying
[380.30s -> 388.68s]  he thought he got the kill on the spy but the spy there's two of us and you know he just don't get
[388.68s -> 394.47s]  spotted that's bad because now i just did like the i'm definitely a guaranteed spy move where i
[394.47s -> 399.46s]  looked at him and i went no i don't i spun around real fast but it's not gonna get me killed i don't
[399.46s -> 410.98s]  think not yet at least let's change speaking of spy let's disguise as a spy i'm okay with this and
[410.98s -> 423.42s]  drop down get you and this guy too oh can we do this for another seven minutes i don't know but
[423.42s -> 435.26s]  i'm gonna go this way i want to wrap around to potentially don't don't don't holy shit why did
[435.26s -> 444.87s]  that not work i was like cut off by the door you are a spy who would win you cannot defeat me he's
[444.87s -> 454.14s]  where you're running where you're running man that was a spy v spy fight i liked i don't know why i
[454.14s -> 457.98s]  like to do that i like to activate the dead ringer jumping down but is the most obvious thing you
[457.98s -> 468.39s]  could like ever do just feels fun i'll get around him oh what am i god i'm breaking the rule here
[468.39s -> 485.16s]  what just what what what what that hit him i refuse to believe that i should have just walked up and
[485.16s -> 491.19s]  stabbed him but i wanted to get the double ambassador headshot that was a stupid move
[491.19s -> 496.73s]  i was trying to get on like the highlight reel and i should have just like killed the damn guy
[496.73s -> 502.26s]  koda walked up and just stabbed him right in his like fucking butt cheeks but no i gotta get like
[502.34s -> 514.55s]  boom like no just get the sure thing germa there i go again come on
[517.05s -> 530.74s]  come on gibs what do you say drop down on somebody we held him for a long time but it's coming down
[530.74s -> 534.26s]  to like the last second here it's going to be the last minute they're going to get it to like right
[534.26s -> 540.57s]  there and it's going to be either team's game i really don't know who at this point hey hey hey
[541.53s -> 549.72s]  well he pushed it pretty far for being one person on it for the remaining 60 seconds i really just
[549.72s -> 556.22s]  kind of want to protect this area i don't want anyone to jump down from here or something i think
[556.22s -> 565.54s]  we're going to be golden though i really do there is a scout look i'm pretending to push it with you
[567.88s -> 577.85s]  i for some reason thought that was over i don't know why holy shit you are a heavy they focused
[577.85s -> 586.81s]  on him 30 seconds now damn it it's all right though i think we got it as long as this guy
[586.81s -> 591.32s]  sticks around as long as these two guys stick around here i don't think they're going to get
[591.32s -> 602.09s]  it and we win the game nice nice use of the charge shot 10 seconds i thought that was by
[603.14s -> 613.02s]  final push let's see if they can do anything with it otherwise we win the game hey overtime
[613.02s -> 622.01s]  three two one 62 points when the fuck did that happen
