[1.85s -> 15.03s]  Hello everybody. Okay, give me a moment while I set this up. I should be able to do this.
[25.78s -> 32.26s]  I spy or we're all gonna leave. No, I have to write a children's book.
[32.26s -> 40.98s]  Doesn't mean we can't play I spy again. All right, let me uh, let's go. So if I do this,
[41.62s -> 59.22s]  I should be able to get this open. Close that. I remember when this was an I spy stream.
[59.86s -> 83.21s]  But, but yes, I spy goes away. But you do get like a on camera guy stream right now. I mean,
[83.21s -> 93.46s]  we've got a guy on camera writing children's book. I don't know. I don't know. So I need paint.
[94.26s -> 104.58s]  I need notepad. I got to block this out. I'm not going to do this like stupid. I'm not going to
[104.58s -> 110.10s]  be like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not going to make noises. I don't make noises. Okay.
[112.33s -> 118.33s]  Don't be naked on this camera. Please don't be naked on the camera for one frame. In fact,
[118.33s -> 128.78s]  I'm going to like open it here to make sure it's not right. I think we're okay. Can you see me?
[129.34s -> 134.17s]  No, not yet. Good. Good. I don't want you to see me yet. I'm not ready for my like close up.
[134.73s -> 147.74s]  All right, let's go down here. Let's grab a window. Let's get the paint window,
[149.93s -> 162.62s]  which there it is. Let's get it nice and clean looking. Those of you think that I'm messing
[162.62s -> 173.69s]  around, I'm actually going to do this. This is not me fucking around. Sometimes we make jokes and
[173.69s -> 181.05s]  sometimes we write whole children's books on stream. So I got this. I need like a notepad
[181.93s -> 189.83s]  to like to write the story. No, this is just to block it out. This is not blocking the scenes out.
[189.83s -> 198.07s]  Let's go with like a gray background though, because this is gonna, it's gonna like hurt
[198.07s -> 209.02s]  people's eyes. That's better. Steal my book and publish it. No, you can't do that because
[209.02s -> 214.95s]  right now you're ready for this. Everything in this stream from here on out going forward,
[214.95s -> 225.74s]  now I gotta be on camera. Okay. You ready? Was that, that was not like a naked frame, right?
[229.11s -> 240.71s]  Okay. So everything on stream here for the remainder of the stream here, I am copyright
[240.71s -> 248.22s]  trademarking the next three hours of the stream. All characters, all original characters and all
[248.30s -> 255.93s]  text written and created by me, Germa985 on the channel Germa985 will henceforth be under my
[255.93s -> 264.86s]  property. So here's what we're going to do. Because I don't want to get myself in any trouble. That's
[264.86s -> 271.58s]  not how it works. Yes it does. I have documented proof. I have a fucking email I sent myself at
[271.58s -> 277.61s]  fucking six o'clock in the afternoon. Why did I just look into the camera like that? That was weird.
[278.78s -> 283.26s]  Okay. So I sent an email to myself. This is now copyrighted to mine and I did it first.
[283.98s -> 289.69s]  So let's go over some characters here because this is important. I'm going to throw out a
[289.69s -> 293.77s]  few phrases and you guys tell me if they've been made into children's books. I'm going to change
[293.77s -> 300.31s]  the title too. That's a good, that's a good point. I'm going to change the title to writing a
[300.31s -> 313.56s]  children's book. This is people are going to come in. Writing a children's book. Is it children?
[313.56s -> 318.94s]  How do you spell children's? Like children apostrophe S like a children's book or is it
[318.94s -> 329.03s]  children's book? Yeah. Okay. But IRL, what would it, what is this even categorized as?
[331.45s -> 338.41s]  What is it? What is this? Just chatting? It kind of, I don't know, creative,
[343.24s -> 361.06s]  science and technology, special event, education, creator verse. No, that's like a fucking,
[361.06s -> 373.43s]  that's like a now defunct Minecraft clone, isn't it? I'm just going to put it under,
[373.43s -> 379.54s]  I can't put this into art. I can't. People are going to come and be fucking angry at this stream.
[379.54s -> 383.22s]  They're going to be like, who's, who's like, oh, like, oh, a nice art stream. You're drawing
[383.22s -> 399.43s]  like fucking children's stick figures. Dick. It is art. All right. Fine. It's going to art.
[401.67s -> 411.32s]  And that is a misleading title. Whatever. It's dumb. All right. We are now in a different
[411.32s -> 415.16s]  category of writing a children's book. So here, this is very important. Incredibly important.
[415.16s -> 419.72s]  Number one, I'm going to throw out some characters names. I'm going to throw some characters like
[419.72s -> 423.96s]  animals and other worldly special effect type creatures. And you tell me if they've been made
[423.96s -> 429.64s]  into a book before, like a creature book. Okay. Ready? Scenario one. Scary monster that's in the
[429.64s -> 434.04s]  closet. That's it. That's hiding under the bed or in the closet, right? A person is scared,
[434.04s -> 438.28s]  but the book is about how the monster just wants a snack late at night from the fridge.
[438.28s -> 450.14s]  Like Munchy the monster just wants a snack. Has it been done? Been done. Been done. Okay. Like
[450.14s -> 459.98s]  monster wants to like, go get a snack and it's late at night and he's hungry. I was sure about
[459.98s -> 471.18s]  this because that's a good idea. Okay. So you've done it before. So you've done it before. All
[471.18s -> 479.38s]  right. Small animal needs help doing basic human activities. That's a big one for a lot of these,
[479.38s -> 488.30s]  right? So you've got like mouse needs help tying shoes. It's been done before. Small
[490.39s -> 496.10s]  rat learns how to ride a bike. Been done? That may have been done. Give a mouse a cookie. That's
[496.10s -> 501.61s]  right. Okay. We can't do that one. Ratatouille. Yeah. But does Ratatouille learn how to ride a
[501.61s -> 520.90s]  bike? No. So Ratatouille in the movie does not learn how to ride a bike. Okay. Okay. So that's
[520.90s -> 526.97s]  a D. He does ride a bike. I can't throw that one in the trash. Okay. So what about, um,
[528.20s -> 531.64s]  there's another, another view. That's the route we can go down. Well, we'll vote on it.
[532.20s -> 537.80s]  So we'll put it up on the screen here. So we got small animal doing basic human children's task.
[537.80s -> 546.25s]  Okay. I'm going to call that option two. So let me write that out. So we've got small animal. It's
[546.25s -> 558.22s]  great. Doing basic children's tasks. Put it in bold. Cause I like that. All right. Can we,
[558.86s -> 567.61s]  can I make that bigger? I don't know. How the fuck do I even do that? Okay. So this is that,
[567.61s -> 575.54s]  that is that option. So now we've got, I really liked the idea of something that is scary. Like
[575.54s -> 581.46s]  is another thing, right? Something that is scary, but is shown over the course of like the 15 pages
[581.46s -> 587.62s]  to not be scary. We're talking dentist. We're talking doctor. We're talking, uh, haircut,
[587.62s -> 593.14s]  go to the haircut. Has it been a haircut book? Scary haircut, but it's not, it's had these been
[593.14s -> 610.20s]  done. All right. But things, things that are, would you fucking let me write this things that
[610.28s -> 621.19s]  are scary to a child, but actually not. Right. Well, actually the dentist is fucking scary. I
[621.19s -> 626.65s]  haven't been in like three years. So that's, I don't know if I agree with that one. I take the
[626.65s -> 632.65s]  dent, take, take dentists off the list because that's scary. Okay. Uh, we got things that are
[632.65s -> 637.94s]  scary to a child, but actually not small animal doing basic children's tasks. Uh, we've got
[638.66s -> 646.52s]  learning, right? So like counting, uh, alphabet. I mean, this has been done a lot. They're like
[646.52s -> 653.00s]  a for alligator B for bear, like that, read that kind of thing. Learning, learning material,
[655.18s -> 663.48s]  not super fond of that, but we can, we keep it there. Okay. So there's learning material,
[663.48s -> 666.84s]  things that are scary to it, but they're not small animal doing basic children's tasks. Or
[668.12s -> 682.04s]  I think we don't want to get too fussy here though. Do the dentist book so I can convince
[682.04s -> 699.35s]  myself that the dentist is not scary. That's really funny, but not today. All right. Learning
[699.35s -> 706.28s]  material, small animal doing basic. Okay. How about growing up, right? There's things you need
[706.28s -> 711.91s]  to know, like how to fucking write a check. The child learns, right? Think growing up,
[712.47s -> 721.29s]  writing a check, doing laundry, um, bathroom, like going to the bathroom. There's a shit load
[721.29s -> 735.53s]  of those books growing, like go into the bathroom. So we got growing up things that are scary to a
[735.53s -> 741.13s]  child, but are not small animal doing basic children's tasks, learning material, growing up.
[742.28s -> 747.21s]  Um, what else? What else? What else? What else? What else? What else? What else?
[755.53s -> 758.57s]  You guys got me how to do taxes. That's not for, that's not a children's book.
[762.41s -> 768.02s]  Uh, dealing like with, with consequences, like, like the wizard of Oz, that was a,
[768.02s -> 773.27s]  that was a hilarious children's book, right? Go into like the wizard of Oz. That would have,
[773.27s -> 776.31s]  what a hysterical trip that was when they met the lion and the dog.
[778.92s -> 790.65s]  Got to keep it simple. Things kids should not do, but I think that goes into, yeah, like, but that
[790.65s -> 798.90s]  growing up kind of fits that category too. How to deal cards. Kids aren't going to dealers.
[804.02s -> 813.30s]  How to play Fortnite. Don't make me write that. I think these are good. I think this is good.
[813.30s -> 820.01s]  I think we got to the basic four here. Or, you know, there also is just like for fun,
[821.69s -> 826.23s]  like the cat in the hat, the cat in the hat didn't have a fucking message. A cat shows up
[826.23s -> 832.12s]  and breaks a bunch of shit in their house and like does a bunch of drugs. The cat in the hat
[832.12s -> 842.31s]  has no act, does the cat in the hat have an actual meaning? The cat in the hat had a meaning. I don't
[842.31s -> 854.57s]  remember that. It's about responsibility. Okay. Um, James and the giant peach. A giant peach
[854.57s -> 860.94s]  rolls into New York and like fucking catamari meatballs in front of James and he gets on it.
[860.94s -> 865.90s]  And then like, they go on a funny adventure. That was it. He meets like a bunch of bugs.
[865.90s -> 886.74s]  That's the, what was that one? It was about friendship. Got it. Uh, friendship or love.
[887.69s -> 895.88s]  Okay. Friendship or love. I'm going to block this out too. I'm getting, I'm getting a flow chart.
[895.88s -> 903.11s]  We're going to have like 17 different scenarios. We're going to like just be ready to write the
[903.11s -> 907.11s]  book and then I'm going to go to bed. Okay. I'm going to look at all this material that we got.
[907.11s -> 918.12s]  All right. See you tomorrow. Is he doing the bit yet? This is not a bit. What bit? I told you one
[918.12s -> 921.88s]  guy said that I've got, you can't write it. You never got to write a children's book. You're not
[921.88s -> 928.60s]  talented. And I said, what the fuck? All right. I think we're good. So things that are scary to
[928.60s -> 935.38s]  a child, but not small animal doing basic children's tasks, learning material, growing up
[935.94s -> 946.54s]  friendship or love, or like a learning, like teaching or learning a lesson. Right. But I guess
[946.54s -> 952.09s]  that could be growing, growing, growing up or no, cause that like going to the bathroom is not like
[952.09s -> 963.32s]  learning how to do something. No, learning a lesson could be anything. Right. So I'm going
[963.32s -> 974.70s]  to move these around. How do you even, how do you select something? Oops. How do I do this?
[975.42s -> 988.49s]  How do I grab this? All right. Yeah. You just don't. Okay. So just make sure you click in the
[988.49s -> 1003.32s]  right spot. So we got, we're almost ready to start here. What do you guys think? Let me get out of
[1003.32s -> 1017.02s]  the way. And by the way, this does not dictate exactly what we're doing. This is just like a,
[1017.02s -> 1026.74s]  what do you guys think? Write a book about the bear? No, it's got to be, it has to be very simple.
[1029.00s -> 1049.22s]  Where, where's my click thing? All right. What do you think? Hold on. You can't see them. Okay.
[1049.22s -> 1054.66s]  It looks like a lot of people gravitating towards small animal doing basic children's tasks.
[1059.13s -> 1063.13s]  Once we pick one, we have to be damn sure that it doesn't exist already.
[1063.13s -> 1067.37s]  We're going to write out like every basic children's tasks that I can think of
[1076.36s -> 1084.26s]  small animal going to the dentist, like biting the guy's hand. No, we can't put that in.
[1092.14s -> 1095.10s]  All right. I would probably gravitate. What do you want to do? Edit colors?
[1095.74s -> 1102.89s]  I'm not going to paint with 3d. So someone said mix them all together. So we've got a
[1103.93s -> 1108.25s]  learning material, a math book about a small animal doing a basic task,
[1108.25s -> 1112.57s]  something that's scary, but it's not learning a lesson at the end and growing a little
[1112.57s -> 1118.82s]  and finding a friend along the way. I'll be a millionaire in a few years.
[1119.54s -> 1126.52s]  It's a small animal doing basically, let's, let's, let's get this shit out of my face.
[1126.52s -> 1142.38s]  All of it. I don't want to leave and look at it. Oh, that doesn't look right. It looks even worse.
[1143.10s -> 1229.24s]  How do I, how do I do that? How do you delete text? I got shit to do. Okay. Okay. So we,
[1232.14s -> 1236.14s]  I don't, I don't use paint to draw like in like the black marker and that's it.
[1237.78s -> 1247.42s]  All right. So we got easy. I'm going to eat. What was it? The task. So we've got tasks
[1248.15s -> 1253.38s]  that are a basic human tasks that an animal is going to do. I got one for you right now.
[1253.38s -> 1258.50s]  Lawn care. Okay. Forget about the animal because we got to pick one that hasn't happened yet.
[1259.46s -> 1279.74s]  Lawn care, basic human task, laundry, cleaning, cleaning the house like a duck that cleans the
[1279.74s -> 1290.22s]  house. That's pretty good. Or a very large animal that's cleaning the house. And you think that it's
[1290.22s -> 1293.66s]  funny because they bump into stuff and break stuff and then they have to clean that up too.
[1294.46s -> 1300.92s]  That's pretty funny. Oh, that's pretty funny. Like a, like a bowl has to clean like a bear,
[1308.52s -> 1314.52s]  turtle. Okay. What? No, no, no. Okay. Shopping. Like whether that's, uh, I'll make it clear.
[1314.52s -> 1334.57s]  Rocherie or otherwise. Okay. What else? Capitalism versus communism. We're talking
[1334.57s -> 1351.38s]  about like laundry here. No, doing homework. That's a basic task, right? Homework. Um,
[1352.74s -> 1356.66s]  reading, like learning to read, but that's kind of learning, but it's that's all a basic human thing.
[1358.14s -> 1362.62s]  Teaching like a fucking alien to read. It could be that doesn't have to be, it could be an alien.
[1362.62s -> 1372.36s]  This could be the first alien, uh, children's book. Cooking. We've got lawn care, laundry,
[1372.36s -> 1379.11s]  cleaning, shopping, homework, reading, cooking, uh, eating healthy. Pretty, yeah, that's pretty
[1379.11s -> 1390.26s]  basic stuff. Hiding a body. You want this thing to sell or do you want me to like get in trouble?
[1402.74s -> 1408.98s]  Computer, computers. Ooh, we got a whole new generation of kids that are going to be on
[1408.98s -> 1418.79s]  computers and iPads, computers and tablets. Like a rat with a computer, like a mouse will get the
[1418.79s -> 1427.99s]  fuck out of here. A mouse on the mouse. Has it, no one's done it. Has somebody done like a computer
[1427.99s -> 1443.06s]  kids learning, like fun, like kids computer mouse with a mouse? No, they haven't. No, they haven't.
[1443.06s -> 1447.37s]  We'll get the mouse a headset too and it'll be like talking because that's people are going to be
[1447.37s -> 1454.68s]  talking on headsets. These kids are growing up with the fucking technology. ABC mouse is already
[1454.68s -> 1468.82s]  a thing and that's what they do. Is that real? ABC mouse isn't a book. It's yeah, it's an online
[1468.82s -> 1480.58s]  fucking web media portal. Yes, it is. Game. Okay. Keep that in mind. Keep like, okay, I'm going to
[1480.58s -> 1487.86s]  just make sure I don't forget this. Possible gaming mouse. No, no, no, not gaming mouse. Fucking
[1487.86s -> 1505.88s]  computer mouse. Computer mouse. You know what I mean here. Okay. So we've got computers and tablets,
[1505.88s -> 1519.06s]  possible computer mouse. Farms. Out on the farm. Right. I know there's a few that already exist,
[1519.06s -> 1535.61s]  but it's okay. We can have our own different one. Basic human task. No, skateboarding is not
[1535.61s -> 1561.35s]  basic. It's hard. Self-defense class. That's not dancing, but that's, yeah, you know, dance. Okay.
[1561.35s -> 1575.48s]  Dancing. Let me fix that. Dancing is possible. Crypto investing. Construction. No, I don't know
[1575.48s -> 1584.01s]  anything about construction. General like housework. No, that's like kind of cleaning.
[1590.84s -> 1602.17s]  Gardening. I would put that under lawn care. Hygiene. Yeah. Hygiene is a good one. Hygiene.
[1602.49s -> 1613.96s]  I don't know if I spelled that right. Who gives a shit. How to steal things from work. Manners.
[1614.68s -> 1621.93s]  Basic. Very basic human thing. Yeah. They always have like, oh, it's a fucking monster that doesn't
[1621.93s -> 1629.37s]  know manners. A monster that doesn't understand manners and needs to be taught manners by the
[1629.37s -> 1644.90s]  family. Has it happened? Why does everything, including a monster, had to have happened in
[1644.90s -> 1654.82s]  Monster's Ink already? Teaching a monster manners. Teaching a monster hygiene. Like a monster doesn't
[1654.82s -> 1661.56s]  brush its teeth. A monster does not brush its teeth. And there'd be a really cute panel of them both.
[1661.56s -> 1665.96s]  You know, like it could be like a little girl, like just barely being able to see above the sink,
[1665.96s -> 1669.96s]  like brushing the teeth. There's a huge monster like brushing and there's like soap all over his
[1669.96s -> 1680.82s]  mouth. And he brushes his teeth with the soap because he didn't know. That literally happens
[1680.82s -> 1711.96s]  in Monster's Ink. That's been done thousands of times. I don't believe you. Hold on. Monster's
[1711.96s -> 1716.76s]  Ink brushing teeth. God damn it. He does brush. He brushes his fucking teeth in the mirror.
[1717.40s -> 1727.83s]  All right. Forget that one. No monsters and hygiene. It's been done. Monsters and cooking.
[1727.83s -> 1736.62s]  They don't know how to cook. So monsters. What? No, no. We're going too far. Stop it. We're going
[1736.62s -> 1746.12s]  too far. Forget about the main character. Get the composition of the story first. Okay? Dancing
[1746.60s -> 1755.54s]  monsters. Haven't done that yet. So okay, we're getting to the point where we can pick.
[1755.54s -> 1769.21s]  I think this is good. So now over here, we are going to put people or things, right? Animals or
[1769.21s -> 1785.58s]  maybe not animals. We got rats. We got mouse. We've got alligator. We've got, we got monsters. We have
[1785.58s -> 1804.84s]  aliens. We have a chipmunk. We've got duck, crabs, lobsters, mollusks. No, that's way too weird.
[1804.84s -> 1817.32s]  Kid doesn't know what a fucking mollusk is. Armadillo. Lobster modillo? That's not right.
[1817.32s -> 1837.21s]  How do I fix this? Lobster, armadillo, aardvark. Aardvark is pretty good. Frog. Frog
[1837.21s -> 1850.95s]  and toad are the same thing, by the way. A seagull. A germ. Oh, actually, you know what?
[1850.95s -> 1858.94s]  That's kind of funny. Like a germ that needs to learn how to eat healthy. A germ that needs to
[1858.94s -> 1866.36s]  learn how to cook. A germ that needs to learn hygiene. What? You know what I mean? Like what
[1866.36s -> 1881.88s]  the fuck? That's so weird. Not good enough. It's not good enough. Okay. Germ. A stove.
[1883.32s -> 1912.66s]  I thought about, okay. A bear. A turtle. I'm not writing gnome. It's not an animal. Cats. Yeah.
[1912.66s -> 1917.45s]  Cats. Dogs. All right. All right. Hold on. Slow down. Slow down. We don't want to get too crazy
[1917.45s -> 1926.46s]  here. Snake. All right. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Rat, mouse, alligator, monster, alien,
[1926.46s -> 1930.86s]  chipmunk, dog, crab, lobster, armadillo, aardvark, frog, seagull, germ, bear, turtle, cat, dog, snake,
[1931.82s -> 1942.82s]  a cinder block. An animate object might be kind of interesting. We could pull a like a beauty
[1942.82s -> 1951.70s]  and the beast and then lose everything because Disney will DMCA claim my life. An elephant
[1951.70s -> 1962.22s]  learning how to fucking brush its teeth. That's pretty cute. Elephant. Spider. Whoa. Whoa. What?
[1962.22s -> 1969.13s]  I'm losing something here. What did we lose? All right. All right. That's enough. That's enough.
[1969.13s -> 1983.03s]  That's enough. That's enough. Enough. I got it. No more. That's good. What was under elephant? I
[1983.03s -> 2000.02s]  don't even. Spider. All right. Spider is down here. Just remember that. So then in the middle here,
[2000.74s -> 2015.58s]  we are going to put a theme. Okay. A theme right here. The theme is going to go down here.
[2015.58s -> 2022.63s]  Oh, what the fuck? So if you can, if you've got a rat doing laundry, what happens? You know what I
[2022.63s -> 2036.79s]  mean? We've got aliens doing homework, but what's the theme? Where are like, we need like a setting.
[2037.59s -> 2044.65s]  That's important. Setting. Just throw them out here. I'll take, I'll take a few of them.
[2049.69s -> 2060.23s]  Like setting. Okay. You, the, no, but the United States is way too vague. Like the kitchen or
[2060.23s -> 2080.22s]  like a home, right? A house. Okay. College. Like in college. The playground, right? Like we're outside
[2081.10s -> 2100.36s]  in the garden at space in the, on the moon, on the moon, on the sun in space,
[2105.21s -> 2123.18s]  in VR, in olive garden, in a restaurant, in a restaurant. I don't, who cares? On a cinderblock
[2125.40s -> 2132.17s]  and a castle. That's a good one. Nice. Excellent work in the school, right? Like in the school,
[2132.17s -> 2137.53s]  we're like learning how to like read in school. We're learning how to clean in school. Okay.
[2143.53s -> 2157.74s]  In underwater. Okay. School and underwater school. I'm liking it. Not in the casino,
[2160.09s -> 2170.82s]  not in prison, in the sky, on a cloud, on a cloud, like on Mount Olympus or something, right?
[2176.52s -> 2185.99s]  In the, in the dirt. No, in the grass. Well, we've got, we got garden, right? In the garden.
[2193.83s -> 2205.83s]  I think we got some good ones. In the wild west. That's not a bad setting. It's like, you know,
[2205.83s -> 2217.58s]  like the cactuses, the cacti, the sun. It could work. Set the book in hell. I don't think that's
[2217.58s -> 2227.54s]  going to work. At the beach. Nobody said the beach yet. Come on. The beach. What's perfect
[2227.54s -> 2243.38s]  for half of these? At the amusement park. Yep. Like the theme park. No. Yeah. Theme park. Like
[2243.38s -> 2270.62s]  an amusement park. At the, but the fair could be the theme park. On a mountain. Okay. In a graveyard.
[2270.62s -> 2276.62s]  I don't know. Graveyard might be a little too scary. I think graveyard would be too scary,
[2276.62s -> 2280.46s]  I think. But like maybe it'd be possible. Like at the graveyard. Maybe you could like make it
[2280.46s -> 2286.23s]  like a Halloween theme. You can make like a Halloween theme children's book. It's like,
[2286.23s -> 2300.14s]  ooh, like we're at the graveyard and okay. Now like the mall. Okay. I think this is good
[2300.14s -> 2305.72s]  because I'm going to show you what we're going to do now because this is important. The zoo. Oh,
[2305.72s -> 2319.30s]  you've got it right at the end there. The zoo. The zoo. The zoo. The farm. I can't forget the farm.
[2322.89s -> 2330.78s]  So here's what we're going to do. We're going to play a game called each one of these is getting
[2330.78s -> 2335.51s]  a number and they're going to be thrown into a random number generator and we're going to pull
[2335.51s -> 2339.91s]  them up. So for instance, category one will be numbered category two, category three,
[2339.91s -> 2347.62s]  and we're going to just pull them fucking out randomly. That's the plan. So let's go ahead
[2347.62s -> 2356.90s]  and do that. I think, I think this is good. Let me, I think that's it. Right now. Like anybody,
[2356.90s -> 2372.81s]  anybody else see one at the hospital? That could work. Okay. Two for it. What the fuck?
[2373.45s -> 2381.50s]  I got to move this though. Okay. So we have, let's see what we've got for numbers here. I'm
[2381.50s -> 2386.98s]  just going to do this very, very easily. I need to open up like random number generator.
[2387.86s -> 2396.06s]  So we need to generate numbers. So we need to number these. This is one,
[2400.20s -> 2406.17s]  two for it. Who's that? What kid is going to know what the fuck two for it is? So we've got one,
[2406.17s -> 2413.29s]  two. Let's just number them just to do it. Uh, with the, where's like a crayon? Just give me a crayon.
[2417.19s -> 2435.75s]  So we've got, who cares? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.
[2437.40s -> 2452.47s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not, that's the same category. Delete that. 11, 12, 13, 14.
[2452.47s -> 2460.39s]  I'm just realizing it's very possible we're going to get like a seagull at the zoo out on the farm
[2465.11s -> 2471.83s]  or like a crab on a cloud eating healthy. Oh, this is going to get fucking weird. I love it.
[2478.54s -> 2492.68s]  Set the book here. What is this? Oh God. Me brushing my teeth. That's so cute.
[2494.76s -> 2499.00s]  A seagull in the hospital in the wild west. Some of these are going to be hard to do,
[2499.00s -> 2510.74s]  but I'm going to do them. Okay. So we got one, two, three, 14 things. Fucking God damn it. One, two,
[2512.39s -> 2540.81s]  three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 18. That settings are themes.
[2540.81s -> 2555.37s]  There's so many of these. One, two, three, six, seven, eight, nine. It's hard to do this.
[2556.58s -> 2583.43s]  10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. And spider is 21. 21 is spider. Okay.
[2583.83s -> 2607.06s]  You mislabeled the activities. Aliens at school. Otherwise. It's too late. I can't fucking fix it.
[2607.06s -> 2618.10s]  I don't care. Are you ready? So here we go. Kat, let's get a number generator over here.
[2618.74s -> 2638.14s]  Let me get it. Hold on. I got random.org. This is truly just random. Let's get a good image of
[2639.10s -> 2655.75s]  that on screen. Where is this? Oops. No, I should be able to get a nice box here. One second. Bear
[2655.75s -> 2666.20s]  with me here. Otherwise. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm doing like, I'm doing like fucking skexy neck. I
[2666.20s -> 2677.90s]  got to like straighten up. You know, they're remaking the dark crystal. Why is Kobayashi
[2677.90s -> 2687.26s]  versus giant bear still here? Okay. Random.org. There it is. Well, you can't see it, but there
[2687.26s -> 2704.57s]  it is. Where the fuck? No, that's, that's just not right. Is it? There we go. Okay. Let's make it so
[2704.57s -> 2711.61s]  it's nice and prominent. So, you know, I'm not fucking faking any of these because I could fake
[2711.61s -> 2729.11s]  them. We're not faking it. All right. Here we go. You can still see everything, right? I'll get the
[2729.11s -> 2736.50s]  fuck out of the way a little bit too. Here we go. So we got, this is for category one. Category one
[2736.50s -> 2743.48s]  there's a 14 different responses, right? So no, no, no, we need to do category, no, no,
[2743.48s -> 2747.48s]  category three first. So that's 21. We need to find out what we're working with. So we're
[2747.48s -> 2765.86s]  working with one of the 21. Here we go. Bingo. 19. We've got a snake, a snake on a cloud,
[2766.84s -> 2780.54s]  snake on a cloud. Otherwise. We're going to stick on a cloud. Otherwise. How do you make that a book?
[2800.20s -> 2804.76s]  Uh, so let's write it down. We got snake on a cloud. We're going to do this like 10 times.
[2804.76s -> 2822.07s]  We picked the best one. Snake on a cloud. Otherwise is the first one. This is an ugly fucking
[2822.07s -> 2828.95s]  text here. Here we go. Let's do it again. We got, uh, we're going to go same category one,
[2829.51s -> 2849.06s]  one out of 21. County, the next possible option, uh, a seagull, a seagull at the beach,
[2849.86s -> 2864.58s]  seagull at the beach. Oh, seagull at the beach learning manners. Cause holy fuck man. Seagulls
[2865.96s -> 2873.14s]  perfect. Seagulls are assholes. They're eating people's like french fries and they're like
[2873.14s -> 2876.74s]  flying over, shitting on people at the beach. Oh my God. Somebody gave a lot of money. That's
[2876.74s -> 2883.24s]  perfect. A seagull at the beach learning manners because they're fucking, they're like flying rats
[2883.24s -> 2888.68s]  and they're, they're, they, they like eat people. They're like vultures. Oh, I like that one. But
[2888.68s -> 2899.46s]  somebody gave a lot of money. Uh, La Cranda just gave 50 bucks. Thank you so much for the $50
[2899.46s -> 2906.92s]  La Cranda. Snakes on a cloud sounds like a good sequel to snakes on a train. Snakes on a plane.
[2907.64s -> 2917.48s]  So, all right. Thank you so fucking much for the $50. It's a huge amount of money.
[2917.48s -> 2926.07s]  My God. Snakes on a plane clouds snakes on a cloud. Otherwise. I like this one a lot. This is
[2926.07s -> 2943.00s]  great. Seagulls at the beach learning manners. Perfect. Let's move it over here. We're going to
[2943.00s -> 2947.00s]  do this like another six, six or seven times. We didn't spend like 35 minutes making this.
[2947.00s -> 2963.64s]  We only do it once. You get the fucking idea. All right. Let's do it again. Next category.
[2964.36s -> 2969.40s]  I know you can't see it. Don't worry. I'll move it. No. Oh yeah. Well, I'll move out of the way
[2969.40s -> 2977.10s]  in a second. There's a lot of possible outcomes here. We have to see a lot of them because I'm
[2977.10s -> 2993.16s]  going to vote on which one's the one. Here we go. Animal or thing. 21. We got nine. Lobsters.
[2994.41s -> 3010.42s]  Lobsters. Pretty good start. Lobsters in a restaurant. It's writing itself.
[3010.98s -> 3022.94s]  Doing homework. Lobsters in a restaurant doing homework. And at the end of the book,
[3022.94s -> 3045.16s]  they get like dropped into the boiling water. Uh, no, that's I don't know. I don't want to write
[3045.16s -> 3062.34s]  that one. Uh, lobsters in the restaurant doing homework. The seagull book already exists. No,
[3062.34s -> 3089.29s]  it doesn't. If that fucking book exists, I'm going to have a meltdown. Greedy, naughty seagull at the
[3089.29s -> 3095.18s]  beach. James is a little bear who happens to save a seagull that has some behavioral problems. One
[3095.18s -> 3099.34s]  day James goes fishing with the seagull. James is disappointed with the bird's display of greed
[3099.34s -> 3103.74s]  when she eats nearly all the catches. James replaces the fish by spending his pocket money
[3103.74s -> 3107.82s]  to buy fish for the at the beach seagull being greedy at the beach, not knowing manners.
[3108.70s -> 3138.89s]  Delete it. Uh, snake on a cloud. Otherwise lobster, lobster at the restaurant. But you
[3138.89s -> 3144.28s]  understand how this one can't be done that the lobster is at the restaurant. They're like the
[3144.28s -> 3157.54s]  food at the restaurant. So it's going to be dark. This one can't be done. Lobster at the restaurant
[3158.47s -> 3166.87s]  doing homework. And then they get like eaten. Like they're at, what are they doing at the restaurant?
[3166.87s -> 3174.25s]  Okay. Well, I got it written down. Let's do it again. One, two, 21, 16. We've got turtles
[3174.25s -> 3192.20s]  or a turtle. A turtle at the zoo. Turtle at the zoo doing laundry. Turtle at the zoo doing laundry.
[3192.20s -> 3207.43s]  That's very, very easy. Turtle at the zoo doing laundry. Okay. We'll do it again. We got, we got
[3207.43s -> 3218.36s]  four and one of them I can't do. Three of them I can't do. Uh, we've got a bear. So that's bear
[3222.87s -> 3241.27s]  at the zoo. You fucking better not be doing laundry. Learning manners. Bear at the zoo
[3241.27s -> 3254.81s]  learning manners. That's a, that one's a resident sleeper. Okay. Only like a few more and then we'll
[3254.81s -> 3272.31s]  move on from here. This is, we've got monsters. Monsters. Monsters in a castle. Does it know
[3272.31s -> 3286.70s]  that I'm trying to do this? Monsters in a castle dancing. That's not bad. Monsters in a castle
[3286.70s -> 3302.22s]  dancing. Okay. What else we got? I want 10. That's one, two, three, four, five, six. That's called
[3302.22s -> 3306.30s]  Shrek. Now, but Shrek was one monster. This is multiple monsters. All like a ball or something.
[3306.30s -> 3330.44s]  All right. 120. Let's go. 13. Seagull again. A seagull underwater eating healthy. An underwater
[3330.44s -> 3345.53s]  seagull eating healthy. He might have scuba gear on, right? That's possible. It'd be funny
[3345.53s -> 3349.77s]  if he had to hold his breath and go underwater. Don't they have to do that anyways? To like eat
[3349.77s -> 3373.00s]  fish? This is going to get messy. I got to shrink these. Seagull underwater eating healthy. I got
[3373.00s -> 3388.74s]  the font has to be smaller. This is too big. Okay. Three more. Let's get a good animal here.
[3388.74s -> 3407.53s]  We've got two seagulls. Alligator. An alligator at the beach. What are you doing at the beach?
[3409.46s -> 3426.68s]  Reading. Learning how to read. That one sucks. How do you make a coherent story with an alligator
[3426.68s -> 3443.00s]  learning how to read on the beach or just reading on the beach? That one sucks. All right. Two more.
[3443.00s -> 3472.94s]  An aardvark at school. Aardvark at school. Thank God. Doing homework. This is a copywritten
[3472.94s -> 3477.66s]  character already. We have to trash this one. That's an aardvark at school doing homework.
[3477.66s -> 3481.34s]  There was a PBS show that ran for like 40 years about that exact topic.
[3485.08s -> 3492.82s]  That one's vetoed. I'm not even going to write it down. Cats. We got a cat or multiple cats
[3498.62s -> 3521.42s]  at the zoo. Cats at the zoo. Otherwise. Great. Fucking hell. All right. Vetoed Arthur,
[3521.42s -> 3532.47s]  so I got to do another one. 20. That's an elephant. Elephant in the wild west.
[3532.47s -> 3549.46s]  This could be good. Reading. An elephant in the wild west learning how to read.
[3550.18s -> 3574.02s]  Fucking reading. I'll write it down. I wish we got shopping. They're all over the place,

[3584.34s -> 3588.34s]  are, I'm going to keep them. Even if they're copywritten, even if it's Mickey Mouse learns
[3588.34s -> 3602.62s]  to read, I'm going to keep it. So we get aliens in a restaurant. Aliens in a restaurant. What are
[3602.62s -> 3609.93s]  they doing there? Cleaning. They're teaching aliens cleaning a restaurant. They don't know
[3609.93s -> 3632.98s]  anything about like humans and they can like learn. Watching them eat. Humans. Humans.
[3637.18s -> 3687.82s]  Eating humans. It's Twilight Zone level. Snakes. I didn't know. I put my head down and snorted.
[3687.82s -> 3759.11s]  God damn it. What's the next one? Okay. We've got aliens. Why? Oh, I don't like this. What are they
[3759.19s -> 3775.29s]  doing? They're on a mountain observing humans. Aliens on a mountain cleaning.
[3784.06s -> 3801.08s]  Okay. Aliens on. Where did that go? What are they cleaning? I don't know. That's just predator.

[3887.43s -> 3907.40s]  I gotta get out of here. I gotta get out of here. Only like one more of these fucking things.
[3907.40s -> 3917.59s]  We have so many categories already. All right. We got an armadillo. No. Fuck it. Ready? Lightning
[3917.59s -> 3920.47s]  round. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. What are you gonna get? What are we gonna get?

[3926.31s -> 3935.24s]  gonna be. Lobsters on a mountain. Lobsters on a mountain. There they go. Where are they? What's
[3935.24s -> 3947.64s]  the plan here? They're shopping. I can work with all this. I can work with it. Last one and we're
[3947.64s -> 3961.08s]  moving on. We have to block something out here. We've got a turtle. Turtle in a restaurant. There's
[3961.08s -> 3974.57s]  so many in a restaurant. Shopping in a restaurant. For what? One more and then we have to do
[3974.57s -> 3990.01s]  elimination. This is the final one. Absolutely no questions asked. Last one. A seagull on a cloud.
[3992.18s -> 4015.24s]  Seagull on a cloud doing lawn care or gardening. Okay. That's one more. Last one. Last. This is
[4015.24s -> 4022.68s]  actually the last one. No questions asked. Final one. That's a duck. No, no, no, no, no, no. That

[4046.94s -> 4053.66s]  fucking it. I gotta get these together. I gotta get out of here. Okay, here we go. We can close
[4053.66s -> 4074.28s]  out of this. All right, so this is a mess. I gotta clean these up. Okay, clean them up. Doesn't
[4074.28s -> 4078.20s]  matter how they look. We just gotta get them in the right spot. We gotta start eliminating them.
[4084.44s -> 4098.46s]  Right here. Alligator reading on the beach. Duck on a farm learning computers.
[4101.69s -> 4107.69s]  Seagull on a cloud learning lawn care. Aliens in a restaurant observing humans and cleaning while
[4107.69s -> 4114.98s]  they observe humans and stuff like that from outer space. Yep. Elephant learning how to read in the

[4138.47s -> 4152.38s]  Monsters in a castle dancing and seagull underwater eating healthy. This is very messy.
[4152.38s -> 4165.54s]  I gotta get a notepad open. Nobody can read this. This hurts. This looks like a glitch in a computer
[4165.54s -> 4172.14s]  game. This looks like you just grabbed the N64 cartridge and fucking pulled it out halfway through
[4172.14s -> 4187.98s]  your game. All right, let me get a like actual notepad because this shit ain't gonna work.
[4188.94s -> 4197.74s]  Notepad. A rich rich text document is also good. Let me get that off the screen before somebody
[4197.74s -> 4209.72s]  fucking throws up. Where am I? No, I don't know. I'm all squished. Go back to normal. There we go.
[4209.72s -> 4224.46s]  All right. Uh, it was very thin. So that's that. Get the notepad open. Okay, I gotta get this
[4224.46s -> 4232.60s]  fucking clean. You know what I'm saying? So we've got turtle in a restaurant shopping.
[4234.22s -> 4249.21s]  That one sucks. We've got cats at the zoo otherwise. Alligator. Alligator of reading on the
[4249.21s -> 4261.38s]  beach. No, what do I do? Just put it in a straw poll. What the fuck am I doing? You know what I'm
[4261.38s -> 4269.77s]  saying? Like just put it in a straw poll. Why am I writing it over here? Uh, by the way, top five
[4269.77s -> 4277.51s]  answers move on and then I'm gonna fucking decide which one. Uh, let's get one over here.
[4295.42s -> 4299.74s]  Okay, uh, so let me get, I'm gonna just condense these so they're easier because there's a bunch
[4299.74s -> 4311.59s]  of them. We get cat shopping at the farm, right? What was it? Okay, we got turtle in a restaurant
[4313.50s -> 4322.30s]  shopping. Let's clean them up, right? Let's just get it clean. Cats at the zoo otherwise. Top five
[4322.30s -> 4328.62s]  move on, by the way. I know I just said that, but I'm gonna reiterate it. Alligator reading
[4329.58s -> 4347.70s]  on the beach. Duck on the farm learning computers. Uh, seagull on a cloud doing lawn care.
[4348.66s -> 4375.05s]  Aliens in a restaurant observing humans and cleaning. Aliens, turtle doing laundry.
[4375.69s -> 4382.68s]  Did I miss one? Chat, what am I looking at here? A mess, but it's gonna be cleaned up right now.
[4391.11s -> 4400.33s]  Okay, uh, we've got elephant learning to read in the Wild West. Almost getting on,
[4400.33s -> 4412.22s]  almost halfway there. Aliens on a mountain cleaning. Elephants in, oh fucking god damn it.
[4412.22s -> 4441.53s]  I pressed enter. Fuck. Can I add to this? Damn it. I gotta do it again. Fuck me. I pressed enter and
[4441.53s -> 4452.49s]  it like stopped it halfway through. Fuck. All right, well, hold on. Ah! All right, I gotta do
[4452.49s -> 4461.66s]  it again. I'm just gonna copy and paste. Yeah, I gotta put it like a fucking video for you guys
[4461.66s -> 4474.52s]  to watch. Hold on. This won't take long. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Turtle in a restaurant
[4474.52s -> 4492.86s]  shopping. Cats at the zoo otherwise. Alligator at the beach. Duck on the farm learning computers.
[4492.86s -> 4503.24s]  Seagull on a cloud doing lawn care. Aliens in a restaurant observing humans and cleaning.
[4503.32s -> 4526.04s]  Elephant learning to read in the Wild West. Aliens on a mountain cleaning. Okay, uh, lawn care.
[4526.04s -> 4530.12s]  All right, now I got just a few more. What was the last one? Aliens from, aliens from outer space on
[4530.12s -> 4545.30s]  a mountain cleaning. Right up there. Elephants in space out on the farm. Uh, alien, uh, elephants
[4545.30s -> 4560.55s]  in space on the farm. Uh, undo lobster shopping on a mountain. Oh, that's a lot of work. Damn. Snake
[4562.17s -> 4575.99s]  on a cloud otherwise. Seagulls at the beach learning manners. Lobster at the restaurant
[4575.99s -> 4592.18s]  doing homework. Fucking morbid. Almost done. Turtle at the zoo doing laundry. Bear at the zoo
[4594.25s -> 4610.68s]  learning manners. Monsters in a castle dancing. And seagulls, seagull underwater eating healthy.
[4612.86s -> 4623.05s]  We're ready. That's it, right? I didn't miss any. We have a straw poll already. Well, I made the
[4623.05s -> 4639.88s]  official one. It's already done. Great poll. Somebody made it 10 minutes ago. Uh, just use
[4639.88s -> 4652.20s]  the official one. Top five, move on. And then whatever the top five are, I'm going to determine
[4652.20s -> 4671.85s]  which one I'm going to write a book about. Since we're voting on this, we get writing credit. How
[4671.85s -> 4681.98s]  many people are here? 5,068 people. It's going to be like a, it's going to be like a Kickstarter.
[4682.38s -> 4686.50s]  All right. The book is going to be like 200 pages long because it's going to be like
[4687.54s -> 4700.81s]  12 pages for the book and then 195 pages for the Kickstarter credits. All right. Let's see
[4700.81s -> 4706.54s]  what we got here. Uh, we got the aliens from outer space observing humans in restaurant and cleaning
[4706.54s -> 4713.43s]  snake on cloud. Otherwise duck on the farm learning computers. Seagull on a cloud doing
[4713.43s -> 4731.53s]  lawn care. Seagull underwater eating healthy. This fucking snake one. Okay. Link the poll.
[4731.53s -> 4751.46s]  There you go. Let's see what's at the bottom. Let's see what nobody wanted. Turtle at the zoo
[4751.46s -> 4760.90s]  doing laundry has 19 votes out of 1400 people that clicked it. Holy shit. Nobody wants to see that
[4760.90s -> 4765.94s]  one. Uh, it's what's with the turtles. What's with the hatred versus the turtle? Turtle in a
[4765.94s -> 4770.26s]  restaurant shopping and turtle at the zoo doing laundry. Fucking nobody clicked on them.
[4772.42s -> 4778.74s]  Although they, they, they do suck. So not turtles, but like the restaurant shopping and like the
[4778.74s -> 4787.67s]  category didn't come out that well. Also lobsters in space, odd on the farm. I'm surprised it's this
[4787.67s -> 4798.36s]  low. That's just elephants are dead. We've got the aliens from outer space at a restaurant observing
[4798.36s -> 4805.18s]  humans and cleaning snake on cloud. Otherwise duck on the farm. See, all right. You got like 30
[4805.18s -> 4843.90s]  seconds. Okay. This is artwork. That's really good. Look at that. It's already fucking there for you.
[4843.90s -> 4859.75s]  That's already made for you. It's already here. That's already cover art. How do you make it so
[4859.75s -> 4880.23s]  fast? All right. 10 seconds and the poll closes. And then I monsters in a castle dancing is down
[4880.23s -> 4891.50s]  there in the middle. So we've got the top five. Thank you for voting. Uh, I'm going to write just
[4891.50s -> 4896.46s]  to make sure they have them. We've got aliens from outer space in a restaurant observing humans
[4896.46s -> 4901.58s]  and cleaning snake on a cloud. Otherwise duck on the farm, learning computers, seagull on a cloud,
[4901.58s -> 4908.84s]  doing lawn care, seagull underwater, eating healthy. I think I could work with some of those
[4917.50s -> 4932.54s]  seagull underwater. Okay. Here we go. I am going to put these new poll, new poll. Let's get a new
[4932.54s -> 4940.66s]  poll going. This is the final five. Just make it a short story. Yeah. It's going to be like
[4941.06s -> 4965.70s]  10 pages long. Write them all and then do a crossover like the Avengers. No. Okay. Snake
[4965.70s -> 4970.62s]  on the cloud. The snake one. No, that's another thing. We have to make sure that of these top
[4970.62s -> 4980.81s]  five, they don't exist already. Is there a duck on a farm learning computers? Because if there is,
[4980.81s -> 4994.63s]  it can't be done. We tried our best to make original content. All right. We've narrowed
[4994.63s -> 5002.62s]  it down and then I get to have my vote, which is worth 600 votes. So just be aware. All right.
[5002.62s -> 5005.58s]  Here's the final poll. I'm going to take a piss while you guys vote on this last one.
[5007.26s -> 5024.94s]  There it is. And then it's time to start writing the book, doing lawn care. I'll be right back.
[5024.94s -> 5033.99s]  I'm going to pee. Good luck. And then I'm going to start blocking the book out and they're doing
[5033.99s -> 5167.02s]  panels. Are we reaching a consensus? No. Yes. No. Okay. Duck friends, computer chase. What is this?
[5172.90s -> 5181.62s]  Give me the middle finger. All right. It looks like at the moment here, we got snake on a cloud
[5181.62s -> 5192.54s]  otherwise is currently the winner. Snake on a cloud. Otherwise. Jesus Christ. How the fuck am
[5192.54s -> 5198.15s]  I going to write a book about this? Duck on the farm learning computers. It could have been
[5198.15s -> 5210.65s]  seagull on a cloud doing lawn care. What the fuck does that mean? Snake on a cloud. Otherwise.
[5217.34s -> 5231.78s]  This one keeps turning me upside down. Okay. But how did you get up there? All right. It's time.
[5240.42s -> 5246.42s]  I think it's time to figure it out. So here we go. Let's block it out. This is it. Snake on a cloud.
[5248.17s -> 5258.14s]  Otherwise. It's going to be like an indifferent snake that doesn't care. Got up on a cloud somehow.
[5258.14s -> 5264.70s]  How's he going to get down? How did he get up there? What? Brilliant. What did I just say?
[5264.70s -> 5267.82s]  What did I say? Clip that. Somebody clip it. Clip it. Clip it. Clip it. Clip it. Right now.
[5267.82s -> 5273.91s]  Clip that. Right now. Give it to me. Give it to me. What I just said. I don't remember, but it was
[5273.91s -> 5292.57s]  good. That was good. Let's block it out. This is it. Snake on a cloud. I rhymed it. Otherwise.
[5292.57s -> 5301.72s]  It's going to be like an indifferent snake that doesn't care. Doesn't care. Got up on a cloud
[5301.72s -> 5306.12s]  somehow. How's he going to get down? How did he get up there? Fucking brilliant. That's the opening
[5306.12s -> 5314.23s]  line. How's he going to get? That doesn't care. Snake. This is a story about a snake that doesn't
[5314.23s -> 5322.47s]  care. That doesn't care. Got up on a cloud. Got up on a cloud. How did he get there?
[5325.58s -> 5329.26s]  Write that down. So make sure everybody writes that down. But no, me. Oh, me write that down
[5329.26s -> 5339.18s]  because it's my book. What did I say again? I repeat that again. What was it? It's going to
[5339.18s -> 5347.93s]  be like an indifferent snake that doesn't care. There once was a snake that didn't care. Got up
[5347.93s -> 5353.53s]  on a cloud somehow. How did he get up there? What did I just say? What did I say? Clip that.
[5353.53s -> 5356.57s]  Somebody clip it. Clip it. Clip it. Clip it. Right now. Clip that. Right now. Give it to me.
[5356.73s -> 5365.99s]  But sometimes I just like just pure genius. All right. That's the opening line.
[5366.79s -> 5371.13s]  When you get an opening line, that's how you get started. I don't care about the other categories.
[5371.13s -> 5379.82s]  This one wins. So we're going to do we're going to start with the it's flowing now. It's flowing.
[5381.46s -> 5388.10s]  Get back to where I was right here. Okay. Get all this out of here. I don't want to look at this.
[5388.58s -> 5403.10s]  Okay. Let's block it out. So the first panel, first page, this is going to be this can be page
[5403.10s -> 5411.62s]  one. Okay. Page one is there once was a snake that didn't care. Got up on a cloud somehow.
[5411.62s -> 5421.03s]  How'd he get up there? That's a little too wordy. I think. Hold on. Page one. There once was a snake
[5421.03s -> 5441.50s]  that didn't care. That's page one. The cover comes later. Okay. This is page one. Easy words for
[5441.50s -> 5450.65s]  children. There once was a snake that did not care. This is not the layout. I just got to get
[5450.65s -> 5461.13s]  it on the front first page. Huge fucking fun. And we'll block that out later. I got to get the
[5461.13s -> 5471.13s]  the basis of the first page. So here's what I'm thinking. So you've got I just Kramered. I'm sorry.
[5471.69s -> 5481.91s]  There once was a snake that did not care. We've got establish the perimeter here. We got
[5483.00s -> 5487.88s]  we got to look it up here like this. You know what I mean? I've seen the cloud and it's just
[5487.88s -> 5494.79s]  an establishing of the cloud. Like they're like fucking children right here. Take a look at this.
[5495.43s -> 5504.78s]  All right. I need the paint tool now. There's remember we need like 12 pages. Okay. So we
[5504.78s -> 5508.76s]  got the kids down here. They're like outside. Remember I'm going to I'm going to fucking
[5508.76s -> 5515.88s]  commission an artist. So we got I'm not an artist. Let's go with like okay. So up here we got like
[5516.68s -> 5521.70s]  cloud right because they're looking up. You can have a couple other clouds like over here
[5523.03s -> 5527.43s]  in this section. Maybe a couple like over here in this section. This is the one the snakes are.
[5527.43s -> 5537.54s]  Don't fucking forget it. It's important. So maybe there's like a ball. There's a two. There's a ball
[5537.54s -> 5540.50s]  bouncing between. I got to just I got to get the action of the ball because I'll forget it.
[5541.30s -> 5554.26s]  There's a ball. No, no, no, no lower ball. Like like I just kicked it. You know what I mean?
[5558.78s -> 5568.07s]  That's the ball. Then you've got let's have the we're going to stick figure because I can't draw
[5568.07s -> 5581.43s]  anything. So you've got like one kid here. You know this like it's a kid. Right. This is I need
[5581.43s -> 5601.62s]  the kick of the ball. Right. Easy. Okay. Easy. It's fucking easy. And then another kid is like here.
[5602.58s -> 5609.77s]  Easy. Maybe like catching a bit like oh I'm about to catch it. Like here it comes.
[5610.41s -> 5621.82s]  Oh maybe like yeah. So the kid is about to catch the ball. They're very happy. Right. Like that's
[5621.82s -> 5630.58s]  a good. This person looks like they're getting a ball kicked to their face. They don't look very
[5630.58s -> 5649.13s]  happy. Well he doesn't. But look I fixed it. So this is the playing of the ball. There once
[5649.13s -> 5654.57s]  was a snake that did not care. And then the reader that has no idea. Right. Reader has no clue what
[5654.57s -> 5659.05s]  the fuck you're talking about. What do you mean that once was a snake that did not care.
[5659.69s -> 5680.31s]  This I see kids playing. There's a house over here too. So we've got the house and there once
[5680.95s -> 5690.23s]  I don't see a snake here sir. Right. That's not a factory. That is a house. It's that's a chimney.
[5695.59s -> 5703.88s]  What are you linking me here. This that's pretty good. But I didn't get that far yet.
[5703.88s -> 5706.92s]  But that was exactly I didn't get that far. But you got you getting the right idea.
[5711.67s -> 5717.03s]  No this is a chimney. It's cold. Look they're wearing jackets. All right. That's the ball
[5717.03s -> 5721.11s]  playing ball. There once was a snake that did not care. But we make sure we had the clouds are very
[5721.11s -> 5729.75s]  prominent in this shot. They are like wow it's pretty pretty. God fuck. It's all right.
[5731.11s -> 5737.58s]  They're huge. So this is the first page. And then maybe like a couple of birds.
[5741.06s -> 5747.14s]  And then maybe for the people with the keen eyes. What color is a snake. This is very important.
[5747.14s -> 5755.29s]  Green. Blue. Pink. Red. Blue. Like you could like a little like right there. Like a little
[5755.29s -> 5766.68s]  face. Little snake face with tongue coming out. Just like oh I see him. Right. Kids love that shit.
[5766.68s -> 5775.61s]  Kids love to be like there once was a snake. Where's this. I found him. Right. The sky is blue.
[5779.62s -> 5783.06s]  Then the snake can be. But is there but is there any copywritten green snakes.
[5783.78s -> 5798.34s]  Is that make sure there's no copywritten green snakes. Are there. None. There are a lot. It's
[5798.34s -> 5804.33s]  a green snake. Snakes are green. Yeah but I don't know what there's like a copywritten fucking snake.
[5805.05s -> 5814.28s]  All right. Well we need to maybe like a green. There once was a snake that didn't care.
[5815.51s -> 5821.67s]  There's a little face popping just barely over that cloud. So they could point it out and be
[5821.67s -> 5827.51s]  like wait is what is that. And then we're gonna medium zoom. Next page. Save this one. There once
[5827.51s -> 5833.22s]  was a snake that did not care. All right. I'm gonna save this. Let's just open up another one.
[5834.62s -> 5845.37s]  Open. How do I quickly just open a new paint. The next page is just this image.
[5845.85s -> 5852.71s]  Yeah you guys are getting it. You are. The gray makes this very depressing.
[5852.71s -> 5863.16s]  Now the grays do not hurt your eyes. What's the what's the fucking. Do I need to open like
[5863.16s -> 5870.49s]  another one of these. Can I just do new. Well let's delete this one. It's control n right.
[5871.21s -> 5890.23s]  Can I do tabs. Save as png. I'm gonna title this page one. Okay. And then just control n.
[5891.27s -> 5895.45s]  Control n. That works. Look I told you it's gonna hurt your eyes. That's why I want to block this
[5895.45s -> 5908.50s]  shit out. Because look. Nope. Right there. Like I just blew everybody's eyes out. So then we got
[5908.50s -> 5914.26s]  the the next one is there once was a snake that did not care. Got up on a cloud. How'd he get there.
[5916.54s -> 5929.13s]  Got up on a cloud. How'd he get there. 50 dollars just came in. From some guy. Thanks for 50 bucks.
[5929.85s -> 5935.70s]  Okay so I've got the greatest idea. Let's say the snake got up on the cloud because he didn't care.
[5935.78s -> 5941.30s]  Right. That's how he got there. But he got removed far from his friends. He's lonely. He wants to get
[5941.30s -> 5946.10s]  back down and through a process of learning how to care again he gets back off the pedestal he
[5946.10s -> 5969.19s]  created for himself. That's too deep for kids. I was gonna have him like fucking ride up on a
[5969.19s -> 5990.63s]  rainbow because like he don't underestimate kids. Well he could still get up there because he wanted
[5990.63s -> 5996.50s]  to get away. He didn't care and he he got removed from his friends and maybe there's a bunch of
[5996.50s -> 6013.46s]  snakes. This is gonna be groundbreaking book. But how did you get up there? Rainbow is the serpent.
[6013.46s -> 6023.58s]  Rainbow snake already exists. Well it doesn't matter. Okay well that's a great fucking idea.
[6023.58s -> 6027.18s]  I'm gonna hold on to that for a second while we make panel two. So this is panel two. We gotta
[6027.18s -> 6038.82s]  get first two panels. Uh the once was snake that did not care. Got up on a cloud. How. Remember
[6038.82s -> 6051.74s]  it's gonna be simple english. Like how did he get there. But we only got you look all these kids
[6051.74s -> 6068.58s]  books are not even one sentence per page. How are we gonna get like a struggle in here. The cloud is
[6068.58s -> 6086.30s]  from the it's not a factory. It's not a factory. Okay so again here we go page two. We are we are
[6086.30s -> 6098.04s]  now up here. Put some more back here for for distance and depth and that way there and then
[6098.04s -> 6105.00s]  here he is looking down. You know he's like staring down like that. I don't know how to
[6105.00s -> 6117.26s]  do that in uh pretend painting. Like he's looking down like that. So he's like looking down.
[6118.06s -> 6139.35s]  He's on the cloud here. Okay that like you gotta get it right you know.
[6140.07s -> 6169.77s]  Okay okay okay okay okay okay. Now we gotta get his mouth. All snakes have the fun tongue right.
[6170.73s -> 6176.50s]  But this is down. He's looking down and he could even have the factory over here. You know what
[6176.50s -> 6188.65s]  I mean. Like we need perspective down. Like maybe you could have like some other shit that's over
[6188.65s -> 6195.29s]  here. Maybe like some other like buildings or something. Like he he is looking the perspective
[6195.29s -> 6208.57s]  is that way. No like this. Like I'm looking at you right now. Like all right so let's get uh I mean
[6208.57s -> 6214.57s]  I can't really. You understand what I'm going for here. Okay got up on a cloud. How did he get
[6214.57s -> 6228.73s]  there? That's page two. Just say bird's eye view. It was a snake. So it wouldn't be it would be a
[6228.73s -> 6236.38s]  snake's eye view. Wouldn't be a bird's eye. Okay page two is done. I don't want to blow your eyes
[6236.38s -> 6258.14s]  out when I do this. So I'm gonna go like this. Save this one. Page two. Okay let's come back.
[6258.86s -> 6271.82s]  There we go. So page three. Here we go. Once was a snake that didn't care. Got up on a cloud somehow.
[6271.82s -> 6287.08s]  How'd he get there? Where we're used to the rain. Droplets of water. Don't fall up there. Watch the
[6287.08s -> 6303.66s]  teeter totter. Um should a storm come in and like fucking lightning and stuff. And that's what he
[6303.66s -> 6328.15s]  like maybe he falls off and goes like down the chimney. How'd it get up there? No that was a
[6328.15s -> 6348.23s]  fun book. Um see you later. No uh the chimney he climbed one day. To his friends. Wait goodbye.
[6348.79s -> 6390.15s]  I'll see you another day. The why could I turn to seagulls doing math? There once was a snake that
[6390.15s -> 6400.17s]  didn't care. Got up on a cloud somehow. How'd he get there? His friends and family he did say goodbye.
[6401.50s -> 6416.17s]  Friends and family he did say goodbye. Reaching higher he wanted to try. It's about reaching too
[6416.17s -> 6422.17s]  high. It's about trying too hard and not setting correct goals for yourself that you get in over
[6422.17s -> 6438.14s]  your head and you get to a point where you can't come down. What did I just say clip that? I don't
[6438.14s -> 6459.67s]  even know what I just said clip it. It was genius though. Whatever it was. It's about reaching too
[6459.67s -> 6464.95s]  high. It's about reaching too high. It's about trying too hard and not setting correct goals
[6464.95s -> 6469.43s]  for yourself that you get in over your head and you get to a point where you can't come down.
[6469.43s -> 6472.31s]  Okay what what what what was the shitty rhyme that I did?
[6473.43s -> 6493.40s]  No that's no but you don't know. It's about reaching too high. No but what was the actual
[6493.40s -> 6505.91s]  line? It was he's okay but how did he get there? To his friends and family he did say goodbye.
[6506.71s -> 6525.32s]  It's about setting realistic goals and this could be like a flashback of him like with a
[6525.32s -> 6535.62s]  fucking hat on right like getting on a train like waving and like getting on a train yep.
[6535.62s -> 6549.38s]  This is going to be an elaborate one here okay so we've got the train to his friends family he
[6549.38s -> 6554.22s]  did say this is like if there's a flashback there's going to be look right watch this
[6555.02s -> 6561.72s]  so in this panel there's going to be like there'll be some like mist around the edges so like
[6561.72s -> 6566.84s]  children can understand that this is like this happened before right so there's like mist here
[6568.70s -> 6584.36s]  how it's cloudy kind of mist and make it cloudy you know what I'm saying let's just get the train
[6584.36s -> 6589.08s]  out so this i'm thinking i'm thinking like this way right i'm thinking like dye like this
[6589.96s -> 6607.61s]  like this is the train and here's like the like the bottom part of the train i gotta get like
[6608.17s -> 6623.66s]  look it's hard to do this there's like the tracks it's it's a fucking dream sequence all right lay
[6623.74s -> 6637.06s]  off you get the idea though like yeah like that is the snake his snake friends are here here they
[6637.06s -> 6648.31s]  are and he's gonna be like out of hanging out of a window with a fucking hat on like it like it
[6648.31s -> 6678.71s]  happened with the 30s just blocking it out this is just like the fucking bitcoin chart so hanging
[6678.71s -> 6688.82s]  out the window he's traveling he's away he's leaving he's traveling he's going to he's going
[6688.82s -> 6702.41s]  to do something he's going to where's he going and it could be like other people like walking
[6702.41s -> 6710.70s]  with other snakes like walking briefcases right with other like fucking hats on it's like a
[6710.70s -> 6722.97s]  fucking briefcase uh and you know like walking in the subway there's like there's like fucking
[6722.97s -> 6729.77s]  40 of these snakes like walking around with like briefcases and shit and imagine that's like just
[6729.77s -> 6736.17s]  kind of everywhere and this is like it's like a living fucking city back here there's a there's
[6736.17s -> 6753.05s]  a factory you know uh there's a couple of the buildings in the back this is like other shit
[6753.05s -> 6760.28s]  over here well i want like you know i want um what do i want over here i want a guy
[6762.14s -> 6766.78s]  uh like okay just imagine these are like other snakes like going to and from places
[6767.66s -> 6797.08s]  okay let me get the hat it's just like a hat uh let's go with like this okay you need a hat
[6797.08s -> 6807.80s]  too you're a business you're a businessman you need a hat on you know like children's worlds
[6807.80s -> 6817.75s]  and books that this is need that needs to be believable you know and make it really really
[6817.75s -> 6824.28s]  obvious that he you know he's got he's got like fucking laundry in here or something he's got
[6824.28s -> 6831.61s]  like a backpack or a suitcase or something over here you're wearing like a backpack right i mean
[6831.61s -> 6835.85s]  this looks like somebody's sitting that is like there's a person sitting on the train next to him
[6835.85s -> 6849.13s]  this is just a person just sitting that you know there's people here there's people but you get it
[6849.13s -> 6854.09s]  okay there's like something going on in here there's like a there's like a there's like a
[6854.09s -> 6860.70s]  fucking elephant or an animal like a lion or something there's like a tiger right here
[6861.26s -> 6877.02s]  waving because kids all kids want to like point out the shit it doesn't matter if it makes no sense

[7201.62s -> 7209.86s]  maybe okay maybe this could be like three or four things going on here right so we could have like
[7209.86s -> 7213.62s]  like small bubble small bubble small bubble small bubble we get to get like four page we're gonna
[7213.62s -> 7225.26s]  get four pages done right now yeah i'm thinking like flashback photo here flashback photo here
[7225.90s -> 7229.82s]  flashback photo here showing flashback photo doesn't matter how the fuck he got there
[7237.99s -> 7245.05s]  flashback inside of flashback no but this whole thing is a flashback so we got him it doesn't
[7245.05s -> 7257.27s]  matter what it was he got he went away trying to do something you know he's like excited and in this
[7257.27s -> 7264.22s]  one uh maybe there's like fucking money in his hand no no kids don't understand money this one
[7264.22s -> 7278.22s]  he's here uh maybe like a calendar a calendar here with a bunch of like x's on it like he's
[7278.22s -> 7290.44s]  been doing a bunch of shit not very sweat marks you know what i mean like there's like oh x like

[7309.06s -> 7319.35s]  wipes it away with his hand you know like he like whip whips the sweat i'm just blocking it out just
[7319.35s -> 7333.37s]  seeing it maybe like it's him uh if this is like like it just it could be anything back in like a
[7333.37s -> 7340.25s]  couple of buildings this could be just buildings back here behind him like he's in like is it like
[7340.25s -> 7355.96s]  a window seat he's got like a big window behind him you know maybe a factory back here like this
[7355.96s -> 7365.00s]  is he this is a window that he's sitting like in front of okay you know wow that was hard
[7375.54s -> 7383.32s]  and then now it's like no not okay now he's remembering this like friends and family you
[7383.32s -> 7387.80s]  know so we gotta have like a flat like a second like a third like flashback of him remembering
[7387.80s -> 7395.14s]  his family you know like oh wow i'd like where's my you know here they are and there's like a whole
[7395.14s -> 7402.90s]  other scene in here of like the like everyone's like waving and saying hello you know he's like

[7418.28s -> 7436.36s]  he's like a piece of working too hard you know what i'm saying and then maybe he looks out over
[7436.36s -> 7451.61s]  all the factories he owns no that's like all right what does he own the fact i don't know
[7451.61s -> 7471.00s]  now that's stupid he wanted to try for this guy he's like fat no he's not fat in the first
[7471.00s -> 7489.21s]  panel i think no sense i have this guy i don't know maybe the company like tanks his sports car
[7489.29s -> 7499.90s]  no kids won't understand that okay like oh like what the hell and notice the symbolism here
[7500.62s -> 7509.24s]  with the way that these are the way that they look they could be factories but it's like so
[7509.24s -> 7523.48s]  muddled in his brain this could be factories they're like shaped like factories could be
[7523.48s -> 7535.45s]  pollution i don't know writing fucking books is hard okay especially when you write them in like
[7535.45s -> 7550.92s]  40 minutes all right wait wait is this a flashback yes this is a flashback so he's
[7550.92s -> 7559.37s]  up on this cloud now and when he wanted to try for the sky what's the last fucking thing he does
[7559.37s -> 7589.42s]  here maybe just maybe just like another front facing camera he's got a nose in this one okay
[7589.42s -> 7605.45s]  he's like irritated he's working and there's a bunch of money behind him no kids don't know
[7605.45s -> 7641.72s]  what money is no he's not going to die either in the story this book sucks uh you couldn't
[7641.72s -> 7650.60s]  pay me to read this well it's a snake on a cloud otherwise that's what we had to work with we got
[7650.60s -> 7660.50s]  to work with it okay hold on i'm gonna try for the sky that's fine this is fine done page done
[7660.50s -> 7667.58s]  there's money behind him this is gold doesn't matter what it is it could be anything something
[7668.22s -> 7683.18s]  okay done that's that's it he sends up the rainbow no he goes up like the gold he goes up like the
[7683.18s -> 7689.94s]  fucking gold and he's on the cloud right he like goes up on the fucking gold and he's on the cloud
[7689.94s -> 7714.10s]  now like yeah i made my millions on the fucking gold it sounded so easy at first all right so
[7714.10s -> 7721.03s]  he's got all the money behind him so let's save this one here i'm gonna let this one's done
[7726.70s -> 7730.46s]  still on this joke i say we're gonna write a book it doesn't matter if it's five or six pages long
[7730.46s -> 7741.64s]  it's still gonna happen all right let's save it it'd be better if i could have any artistic
[7741.64s -> 7749.45s]  ability at all all right page four he's gonna ride up the fucking gold all right i got the
[7749.45s -> 7768.33s]  rest of it already done okay so we're riding the gold i get this done in fucking five seconds
[7768.33s -> 7792.79s]  okay here we go i can write the line after so that's like this is like the the yellow brick gold
[7801.67s -> 7817.11s]  there's like a fucking window here it's not a factory this is not a factory it's like his
[7817.11s -> 7830.01s]  office somewhere let's get the clouds over here okay i fucked up a little bit over here but it's
[7830.01s -> 7839.86s]  fine there he is he's like going up like whoa he's really fast he's like his face is like head is
[7839.86s -> 7865.77s]  like whipping around like holy shit this is i'm going too fast that's his mouth is up here
[7866.41s -> 7870.25s]  whatever his mouth is supposed to be that way but it's fine like his head he's back this way
[7876.44s -> 7882.71s]  okay i'm just blocking the story out okay i'm just blocking out for the when i give the artist
[7882.71s -> 7899.54s]  direction all right so read back to me it's going too fast i better hold off now or it won't last
[7899.54s -> 7914.87s]  no this is somebody just said easiest money what is this have we talked about how like writing a
[7914.87s -> 7918.15s]  children's book would be the fucking most easy money you could ever make those you guys like
[7918.15s -> 7922.31s]  wondering oh what the like i have like some artistic talent like what what should i do
[7923.19s -> 7931.98s]  make a fucking children's book your whole story can be like 14 words yeah and just draw like
[7931.98s -> 7941.18s]  cute fun pictures if you're like artistically talented like just write a children's book make
[7941.18s -> 7949.05s]  up a story doesn't matter what the story is it doesn't thread i'll prove it to you guys i will
[7949.77s -> 7957.78s]  something you guys have to remember here i mean this is i've been live for four hours
[7958.98s -> 7971.72s]  and we've been doing this for like two so if people spend a decade of their life writing a book
[7972.71s -> 7980.47s]  people spend years of time writing a book if this is the bullshit that i can come up with in fucking
[7980.47s -> 7985.93s]  45 minutes to an hour that's some pretty good like time versus investment you know what i mean
[7985.93s -> 7992.90s]  that like really some people write a book for fucking four years and i'll prove it to you
[7993.54s -> 8002.18s]  but it's not good though but that's this is art you can't say that
[8004.73s -> 8020.30s]  that's why we're in the art category all right here we go you just you you're fucking up with my
[8020.94s -> 8045.94s]  mojo here so it's too fast it won't last now soaring and seek soaring and seeking
[8053.06s -> 8074.33s]  how high can he go soaring and no soaring and slithering because he's a snake yeah
[8074.33s -> 8084.73s]  kids love that shit done this page is done this one's done now we're now cranking them out see
[8084.73s -> 8098.10s]  i'm gonna roll here this is page five and yes i am well aware that this is gonna end up being
[8100.66s -> 8106.58s]  the quality of something that you would get if you went to a diner and it's the shit that the
[8106.58s -> 8110.98s]  kids drawn with their crayons to like protect the table i'm aware of that that doesn't mean it won't
[8110.98s -> 8130.31s]  sell all right soaring and slithering how high can he go to the moon no that no i'm not doing
[8130.31s -> 8146.09s]  a cryptocurrency bullshit thing here soaring is living how high can he go yeah i saved it i
[8146.09s -> 8154.02s]  saved it i have a good comeback there's only like three more pages and then we're done soaring and
[8154.02s -> 8190.31s]  slithering how high can he go it's the furthest a snake the snakes ever known where it's soaring
[8190.31s -> 8204.02s]  soaring slithering how high can he go shut up guys writing books is fucking hard
[8214.89s -> 8232.63s]  uh all right how can he go this looks nice comfy and this looks nice comfy and oh comfy and
[8233.19s -> 8237.35s]  this looks nice he's getting off on the cloud and he's like really up there this looks nice
[8237.35s -> 8250.01s]  comfy and this looks nice comfy and nice no this looks nice comfy and soft no it's gotta be this
[8250.01s -> 8258.10s]  looks nice comfy this spot is cool comfy and nice this part is this this spot is wow this
[8258.10s -> 8269.06s]  shit is fucking dank this looks nice comfy this looks nice full of mice no but we don't have to
[8269.06s -> 8290.86s]  eat anything this looks nice comfy and covered in lice no this looks nice this will suffice
[8292.95s -> 8311.96s]  you fucking saved this project whoever the fuck you are bingo and the fucking gold road is going
[8311.96s -> 8327.02s]  up and down and around and he's it's right he lands on the cloud only two more pages after this
[8327.02s -> 8334.81s]  guys and i'm done and i win the bet what somebody got me the five grand that i wasn't gonna do it
[8340.94s -> 8350.28s]  pay up you could have gone you could have gone even like higher you know what i mean
[8351.00s -> 8376.09s]  like this keeps going right yeah they got this like okay yeah yeah yeah and if you guys are
[8376.09s -> 8384.78s]  wondering here what's going on with this it's shaped like a snake interesting because this
[8384.78s -> 8395.19s]  is his own greed that got him here and it's his own we're talking metaphors inside of
[8395.99s -> 8418.09s]  the metaphor when he lands like a factory smog is gonna go right into his fucking face
[8419.40s -> 8427.48s]  and he's gonna like cough like like a huge hack no no okay i gotta get rid of the fucking
[8428.20s -> 8446.10s]  how am i gonna wrap this up in a single page he look in the next page he realizes that he
[8446.10s -> 8450.58s]  misses everybody and like he well why do i i miss like everybody and i want to like
[8452.57s -> 8461.88s]  come down and see everybody and then he's gonna slide down um a slide i've made it to something
[8461.88s -> 8473.70s]  and then he lands in the family everyone's happy no he's not gonna jump off so he's like looking
[8473.70s -> 8495.40s]  down there's the cloud you get the idea this looks nice this was suffice he sees the cloud
[8495.40s -> 8508.71s]  he's gonna get off no no what do you mean no conflict book sucks so this is all shit this is
[8508.71s -> 8514.12s]  all flashback isn't it yeah this whole thing is a flashback so i had like the mist on the edge of
[8514.12s -> 8530.47s]  that the whole book has been a flashback it's okay we've got two more pages page six here it is
[8531.45s -> 8538.89s]  and then page seven incoming this looks nice this was suffice now we're back in the regular time
[8538.89s -> 8549.69s]  like now you understand so bright okay here we go there's no point to the book there's no point to
[8549.69s -> 8556.52s]  any children's book it's about like how to clean your room this one is about uh a random number
[8556.52s -> 8563.32s]  generator and uh not being not going don't like make sure you like don't lose your friends and
[8563.32s -> 8569.10s]  family and friendship and like the james and the giant peach the fucking giant tomato rose through
[8569.10s -> 8587.67s]  town is the same exact story he has to go back and like and enjoy his friends and shit james
[8587.67s -> 8599.45s]  and the large tomato i never read the book i i haven't read the book in like 30 years

[11031.02s -> 11041.64s]  the vibe is incoming shout out to the one guy that said you couldn't do it and i mean we there
[11041.64s -> 11046.92s]  was probably like 5400 people 5300 people there i dropped a thousand viewers writing and doing
[11046.92s -> 11060.65s]  that stupid stream it's okay uh look it don't matter you were number one trending on twitch
[11061.61s -> 11067.06s]  no it doesn't matter look as long as i'm having a good time and you guys are having a good time
[11067.06s -> 11072.09s]  it's fine it's that don't matter i had a lot of fun this is a fucking fun stream

[11137.26s -> 11150.07s]  of people thought were fun late to the party pretty much a five week coming up here but the
[11150.07s -> 11153.67s]  reason why i'm gonna do three days in a row with five is because those streams are not going to be
[11153.67s -> 11159.74s]  very long those of you that know that you saw me play other games with the psvr i could get this
[11159.74s -> 11165.98s]  image off the fucking screen too by the way i can really only go in that thing for like four hours
[11167.62s -> 11179.35s]  so we'll just do three days in a row right with like three to five hour streams can i even get
[11179.35s -> 11190.26s]  this off the screen it's like kind of stuck here forever keep it for the stream over but yeah we'll
[11190.26s -> 11197.05s]  do a few days in a row five shorten the streams up a little bit but go more days so thanks for
[11197.05s -> 11201.77s]  coming thanks for watching a little bit shorter today but uh i did the things that i thought i
[11201.77s -> 11213.67s]  would that would be fun to do that's the thumbnail for the stream oh god yeah and also i was talking
[11213.67s -> 11222.60s]  to uh i was talking to kiwo and she was talking about maybe doing vr chat because i don't know
[11222.60s -> 11227.96s]  anything about it and she knows that whole world so we may do a stream where we just do vr chat and
[11227.96s -> 11244.22s]  fuck around you know we talked about it don't do that heavy supervision don't worry i'm gonna be
[11244.22s -> 11256.78s]  i'm gonna be on lockdown it's the meme game boomer explores the virtual world it's our virtual world

[11604.01s -> 11607.93s]  money to ask when you were going to play shen mu and you said you would start on thursday i remember
[11607.93s -> 11617.83s]  rich streamer lies to his fans no no no no what happened was here's what happened i got addicted
[11618.39s -> 11626.31s]  i got addicted to crazy taxi and space channel to a point where i bought space channel part one
[11626.87s -> 11633.50s]  and i'm gonna play that so i got addicted to other dreamcast games before opening shin mu
[11634.73s -> 11639.69s]  so what's gonna happen which i own one and two shin mu is gonna have to turn into one of those
[11639.69s -> 11645.82s]  streams where it's just i'm just gonna relax and i'm gonna play it because it doesn't it didn't
[11645.82s -> 11651.74s]  fit in with like the dreamcast streams because it's a long game that requires a lot of attention
[11651.74s -> 11657.26s]  and a lot of time so i couldn't really just open up shin mu for 40 minutes all right that was funny
[11657.26s -> 11672.09s]  hello well no you gotta get that game attention in time so that's why they haven't seen shin mu
[11672.09s -> 11675.29s]  yet that's why and also ace attorney a lot of people have been talking about ace attorney
[11676.42s -> 11681.78s]  and i know i said i was gonna play ace attorney but then i was told that there's a better version
[11681.78s -> 11687.86s]  that's gonna come out that's being remastered in hd and the ipad version sucks and it's buggy and
[11687.94s -> 11692.97s]  broken and terrible and then i'm like ah i was gonna play it on the ipad and then get a ds but
[11692.97s -> 11704.71s]  i'm emulating a ds is i'd rather just own it and do it legally change oh i gotta change category
[11704.71s -> 11713.78s]  you're right because that is true we're just kind of sitting here change the category i'm no longer
[11713.78s -> 11733.98s]  streaming art you are correct on that for sure uh just irl uh chatting right okay there we go
[11734.62s -> 11738.06s]  yeah i don't want to just be in a category i'm not supposed to be in well other people are
[11738.06s -> 11744.20s]  actually doing art and stuff on stream so you can play ace attorney on apple yeah but that's what
[11744.20s -> 11750.44s]  i'm saying uh the ipad version i've been told by many people is not the version that i want to play
[11751.24s -> 11760.36s]  it's apparently not very good it's not as clean as the ds version kind of sloppy from what i've
[11760.36s -> 11770.68s]  heard it is something i'm going to do eventually when the pc version comes out the pc version has
[11770.68s -> 11779.66s]  a random release date of 2019 yeah it is just going to come out one day but i'll be ready uh

[11914.01s -> 11919.45s]  is real i used to play these games these i spy games in my elementary typing class in the fourth
[11919.45s -> 11925.53s]  and fifth grade the teacher let anyone over 75 words per minute goof off and i had the highest
[11925.53s -> 11934.01s]  in my class at 95 yeah at some point the teacher is probably just you know what you're doing at
[11934.01s -> 11944.38s]  that point you probably had to pass with like 30 or 40 words per minute that's a lot for being
[11944.38s -> 11953.83s]  that young though you could go on to be like a court stenographer going that fast but yeah i
[11953.83s -> 11961.99s]  never played the i spy games i did not play it it was cute it was cute it was endearing
[11962.79s -> 11969.32s]  i could see what people have such fond memories of it i can a stenographer needs 200 plus words
[11969.32s -> 11977.48s]  per minute how do you not run into sentences on each other if you can do 200 words a minute
[11978.78s -> 11982.78s]  at some point you the words that are coming before the words you just typed are already
[11982.78s -> 11990.71s]  happening in your brain and on the screen it's just too that's too fast i don't know how that's
[11990.71s -> 11997.50s]  possible uh hey rtm thanks for the three bucks i remember when i was a little lad i would read
[11997.50s -> 12002.54s]  the look alike books which were kind of like i spy but instead of having things to look for
[12002.54s -> 12007.18s]  they would just present an image of day-to-day life recreated with common items like for a movie
[12007.18s -> 12011.90s]  theater scene the ticket booth would be made out of film canisters and the bright stage lights
[12011.90s -> 12017.18s]  would be popcorn i haven't thought about those since school so thanks for unearthing a pleasant
[12017.18s -> 12029.13s]  childhood memory absolutely i never played them but they sound interesting 3d movie maker was my
[12030.38s -> 12039.08s]  childhood game that i played on the computer that was like 1994 1995 so i was like how old was i

[12059.58s -> 12064.70s]  systems that i i love reminiscing on how it's like the stepping stone for all video games
[12064.70s -> 12069.10s]  but i also don't think i'd ever want to go back and play atari because it's actually like two
[12069.10s -> 12074.30s]  tetris blocks on the screen moving back and forth in a ball going somewhere between them
[12074.94s -> 12085.16s]  it's not they're not like oh yeah i can't wait to go back and play tanks not really but i do
[12085.16s -> 12090.36s]  respect the fact that it was the stepping stone for pretty much everything so you have to respect
[12090.36s -> 12100.44s]  that the pitfall is at least is interesting enough but a lot of the atari library is very very
[12100.44s -> 12109.46s]  simple stuff the 2600 can be fun no i know it can be but i'm not sure that's something i would
[12109.46s -> 12118.71s]  want to go back and go get and oh i'm gonna spend like a grand on atari 2600 stuff not necessarily
[12118.71s -> 12129.10s]  i'll watch a documentary about it and say that was awesome thank you damona cucumber for the
[12129.10s -> 12133.58s]  one dollar he takes so long with the camera because talax needs to set up the facial tracking to make

[12208.44s -> 12214.92s]  a joke out of the category so that's why it's kind of hard to put myself in a category on when we do
[12214.92s -> 12224.39s]  these things because it's like it was only 3k relax wait what no it was like it was like 50 i
[12224.39s -> 12230.55s]  looked over it was like 5500 and we transitioned out of the uh it was like at least 40 48 to yeah
[12230.55s -> 12253.37s]  it was 5k it was relax it was 2k egomaniac well anyways anyways what i was saying is it's sometimes

[14257.38s -> 14261.38s]  specifically it's something that you or your community offers that others don't something
[14261.38s -> 14271.53s]  that would explain the abundance of them thinking i don't know well are these is this the are these

[14307.02s -> 14310.54s]  question i just said it it's okay what do you have to say about the overwhelming amount of furries
[14311.54s -> 14320.31s]  i don't even think about that i see them as you talk about the overwhelming amount of germ
[14320.31s -> 14325.91s]  to take take furry out of that sentence overwhelming amount of germa fans i don't
[14325.99s -> 14341.43s]  got nothing wrong with that what's wrong with that i'm not a fan well every fan is a furry
[14342.07s -> 14349.27s]  i don't think that's true did you just call it no i'm saying it doesn't matter i like that

[14817.35s -> 14821.59s]  uh snooze and coffee thanks for the one dollar still thinking about making those trading cards
[14821.67s -> 14828.22s]  now that you have the store i remembered it don't think you i forget it uh i've talked about the
[14828.22s -> 14832.22s]  trading cards a couple times the thing about the trading cards thing that i want to do here's if
[14832.22s -> 14836.38s]  you're not curious the thing like an idea that i have that i thought would be fun is to make
[14837.58s -> 14844.06s]  collectible cards and physical packs uh not a card not a game but just kind of a collectible
[14844.06s -> 14851.66s]  physical tangible thing to hold on to for fun and have different you know oh like i open you open
[14851.66s -> 14855.26s]  up like a pack and there's art on the pack and it's nice and they're made well and they're you
[14855.26s -> 14860.78s]  know distributed and there's like a bunch of different commons and like really like an epic
[14860.78s -> 14864.54s]  card in each one it wouldn't be very expensive would just be for fun just to have for the
[14864.54s -> 14872.58s]  community and what i ran into with i know a guy that knows like that industry about like selling
[14872.58s -> 14878.10s]  and wholesaling and uh did a lot of research for me and how much things are going to cost
[14878.10s -> 14881.91s]  and the whole thing was going to cost like tens of thousands of dollars it's going to be like
[14881.91s -> 14887.05s]  probably thirty to fifty thousand dollars for the whole thing so i was like uh i'm probably
[14887.05s -> 14894.23s]  gonna have to hold off on that because it was gonna cost a lot of money just even the card
[14894.23s -> 14905.77s]  packaging and card packs themselves is it like a lot of production cost just to get them made so
[14906.65s -> 14913.00s]  not now but i always told myself so for instance if it was let's say i could like kind of if i could
[14913.00s -> 14918.20s]  like swim by because obviously it's the production cost which was a lot of money just to get it in
[14918.20s -> 14925.42s]  the first place and we're talking remember we're talking if you sell a card pack and there is think
[14925.42s -> 14929.82s]  about this how just just physical how many of these things would have to be made because if
[14929.82s -> 14937.69s]  they were like five to ten cards in each like card pack i would need to produce potentially
[14937.69s -> 14943.72s]  thousands of cards right even if they were only like 50 to 100 pieces of artwork they would need
[14943.72s -> 14952.04s]  to be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cards made it's a lot of cards so my theory was if i
[14952.04s -> 14956.52s]  ever get like to a position where i had a lot of extra kind of income or a lot of money that i had
[14956.52s -> 14961.67s]  that i was ready to go it would be sort of a decision i'd have to make because as long as i
[14961.67s -> 14967.00s]  could like break even that i was it was something i wanted to do and maybe the production cost
[14967.00s -> 14972.07s]  paying i was gonna have a bunch of artists potentially but as of right now it's not like
[14972.07s -> 14984.46s]  on the table not now so that's kind of the long and short of the whole thing so uh and i what
[14984.46s -> 14989.42s]  i've told myself recently is coming up with ideas and things that i'd like to do are great
[14989.42s -> 14997.18s]  but i really need to focus on things that i can do now not things that i want to do later things
[14997.18s -> 15010.01s]  i can do now and that's something that i can't do now hope you understand green screen green
[15010.01s -> 15014.98s]  screen card is just a green card yeah it's gonna be like a bunch of characters a bunch of original
[15014.98s -> 15023.11s]  like rumble characters and no like copy written characters but there's plenty of original stuff
[15023.11s -> 15031.37s]  to make into like a little card thing at least i think but we'll have to wait maybe but thank you
[15031.37s -> 15038.38s]  snoozing copter uh thank you though for the one two dollars you oh i accidentally press enter now
[15038.38s -> 15041.82s]  see what you made me do i messed up and i forgot what i was saying oh yeah apparently you didn't
[15041.82s -> 15046.66s]  promise my me my lawyer just told me but whatever if you still want to do it you know where you can
[15046.66s -> 15053.00s]  find me yeah and that's i've wanted to make like a game to all these things of stuff that's gonna
[15053.00s -> 15060.09s]  have because it's got to be by the fucking book because i'm not gonna do like a kickstarter or
[15060.09s -> 15065.80s]  do like oh i'm gonna throw up like fucking 30 grand unless like it is certain that it's
[15065.80s -> 15070.52s]  going to be completely by the book people are going to get paid like this amount and this is
[15070.52s -> 15075.48s]  what's going to happen this is who's going to be involved it's a it's very messy and i don't want
[15075.48s -> 15081.40s]  to cause like a mess in this community so i'm going to have to be very very careful with stuff
[15081.40s -> 15093.19s]  like that because then you kind of get into the weeds of are there too many people that are on
[15093.19s -> 15098.71s]  the project are there do you have enough money to pay everybody make sure that first before it's
[15098.71s -> 15114.90s]  like oh yeah you you you you you you you and you it's got to be done right and i obviously
[15114.90s -> 15120.74s]  want to have a significant amount of money to pay people because people are going to be making
[15120.74s -> 15129.90s]  potentially at least a handful of pieces each so it's got to be done right i can't just do it
[15129.90s -> 15134.97s]  just there let's go tomorrow i guess i'm gonna write like some stuff down no it's gonna be done
[15134.97s -> 15141.58s]  correct but i do appreciate the enthusiasm because it shows that there are there's a lot
[15141.58s -> 15148.81s]  of interest so but thank you thank you to base grandpa as well for 15 dollars thank you base

[15377.37s -> 15381.69s]  and everyone thought it was just a fad that had passed until nintendo resurrected the industry
