[0.31s -> 15.38s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerema here with a Team Fortress 2 Gameplay commentary.
[15.38s -> 26.55s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Medic. It's been a million years. I know, I'm sorry. My last Medic video was like, at least two months ago.
[26.55s -> 36.55s]  I mean, I've done live commentaries and, of course, livestream stuff with the Medic, but I haven't done a sit-down, discussion-thought-out Medic commentary since I was like 11 years old.
[36.55s -> 43.98s]  We are gonna change that right now. Gonna talk about the Kritzkrieg. Gonna bring up why it is my favorite out of all the Medic guns.
[43.98s -> 48.98s]  Well, there's only three, but it is my favorite out of the three. There's a couple of different reasons for that, and I will get into them.
[48.98s -> 58.22s]  But I also want to talk about computer upgrades in this video as well, because I just bought a bunch of them, and I spent all last night putting it all together.
[58.22s -> 66.22s]  And it can be kind of a headache, and it can be really irritating sometimes, but the end result is awesome. I have pretty much a brand new computer.
[66.22s -> 74.46s]  It's like taking the engine out of a Chevy and putting it into something else, you know what I mean? It's still the same case, but it's got different stuff in it.
[74.46s -> 83.46s]  And, of course, I want to tell you what stuff I put into it. But first, we're gonna talk about the Kritzkrieg right now.
[83.46s -> 87.46s]  What kind of transition was that? What am I, introducing a king?
[87.46s -> 98.43s]  And here he is, your grace, the almighty Kritzkrieg. All hail the Kritzkrieg, your grace. I'm watching too many episodes of Game of Thrones.
[99.43s -> 106.80s]  Anyways, the Kritzkrieg is my favorite pub medigun. Now, specifically because of the word I just used, pub.
[106.80s -> 113.98s]  This is the easiest medigun to jump into a game and just play with, because you never really have to coordinate Ubers.
[113.98s -> 123.15s]  This is the only medigun where if you pop an Uber on somebody, Kritzkrieg on someone, it doesn't matter if you timed it right or if there's a sentry around the corner or something like that.
[123.15s -> 129.15s]  When you use the Kritzkrieg, you are gonna get some benefit no matter who you do it to or when you do it.
[129.15s -> 134.15s]  As long as you're weary of people's reload times, that's the number one thing you need to remember.
[134.15s -> 143.52s]  Because if you pop a Kritzkrieg randomly on a soldier, a demo man, or really anybody that has to reload their weapon, you're kind of putting yourself in a bad situation.
[143.52s -> 150.70s]  Because they might not even have anything to shoot. And even if they do, even if they have one or two rockets or one or two grenades or something,
[150.70s -> 155.70s]  you put them in a freakout mode, because they go, why? How many times does that happen to you?
[155.70s -> 160.70s]  It happens to me all the time when I get Kritzkrieg'd and I have one rocket or two rockets inside of my rocket launcher.
[160.70s -> 166.70s]  And I go, okay, hold on, do I shoot? No, reload. And you can make the person really, really uncomfortable.
[166.70s -> 169.70s]  So remember that when you have your Kritzkrieg ready to go.
[169.70s -> 176.19s]  Besides that, and of course knowing where enemies are and if there's gonna be more than one or two people around a corner,
[176.19s -> 181.19s]  that's the only coordination you need with the Kritzkrieg, at least in a public game standpoint.
[181.19s -> 186.19s]  Now with the Uber Charge or even with the Quick Fix, you need to know where sentries are.
[186.19s -> 189.19s]  You need to know who to Uber. You need to know when to do it.
[189.19s -> 194.19s]  But with the Kritzkrieg, a lot of that pressure is taken off your shoulders and you just become a healer.
[194.19s -> 199.19s]  You don't have to worry about really anything else. And if you Kritzkrieg somebody, oh, I Kritzkrieg that soldier.
[199.19s -> 203.43s]  What did he do? Kill two people? Sick. Nice job, dude.
[203.43s -> 207.43s]  It's not like with the Uber where you do it to somebody, turn a corner, sentries there.
[207.43s -> 210.43s]  Sentry doesn't go down and everyone is just like...
[214.74s -> 220.35s]  That doesn't really happen. But it does need to be noted that this kind of carefree Kritzkrieg...
[220.35s -> 224.35s]  I just made a tongue twister right there. Kind of carefree Kritzkrieg.
[224.35s -> 231.53s]  This style only really works when there's another medic on the team that's using regular Uber or you're on defense.
[231.53s -> 236.53s]  Because obviously if you're on offense and there's a bunch of sentries around, you're not going to be able to really push anywhere.
[236.53s -> 243.09s]  So keep that in mind. So with that, let's transition to talking about computer parts.
[243.09s -> 249.09s]  I want to bring up this because I'm so excited. I just got three new additions to this little home of a computer here.
[249.09s -> 257.09s]  I got a GTX 670 and I used to have a GTX 470. So that's the video card upgrade. I'm loving that. It's awesome.
[257.09s -> 261.09s]  It's so much cooler than the 470. I will say that. Oh my God.
[261.09s -> 273.09s]  My 470, I used to have to put the fans up to 75% to keep games like Team Fortress or even Diablo 3 to stop from running at like 90 degrees Celsius.
[273.09s -> 276.09s]  That's how insane that is. So that's a huge upgrade for me.
[276.09s -> 282.09s]  The second big thing is I got six more gigs of RAM. So instead of six gigs now I have 12 gigs.
[282.09s -> 285.09s]  Which is obviously going to help so much with video editing.
[285.09s -> 290.09s]  And I got another hard drive. So I have a brand new 7200 RPM hard drive in here now, internal.
[290.09s -> 295.46s]  I was using an external hard drive for a lot of my recording stuff through eSATA.
[295.46s -> 299.46s]  So I'm glad to throw that thing in the garbage. Get rid of it. I hated that thing.
[299.46s -> 305.76s]  The one thing I could not upgrade, which it's kind of, if you're going to do that, you might as well buy a new computer.
[305.76s -> 313.94s]  I wanted to upgrade the processor. I have a 950, i7 950 in here. It's overclocked and it's getting kind of old, which scares me a little bit.
[313.94s -> 320.94s]  But I couldn't really do anything about it. I think the sockets in this thing and this motherboard only allow the old generation i7s.
[320.94s -> 325.30s]  So I wouldn't even be able to get one of the new ones. I'm not that concerned about it though.
[325.30s -> 331.80s]  I got these upgrades. I'm good to go for a while. I'll cross the processor bridge when I have to, but for now I'm fine.
[331.80s -> 335.80s]  So that wraps up this video, guys. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[335.80s -> 339.80s]  And I'll catch you guys all soon. So take care, everybody.
