[0.82s -> 14.58s]  He's on time. I am on time. I made it. I'm here. And I got the tweet out too. Seconds to spare.
[14.58s -> 22.65s]  Yeah, well, I started at 12.59. But it takes two, three minutes for it to process through the
[22.65s -> 27.54s]  internet and then go through your screen and then get to your computer. Why are my lights not on?
[28.18s -> 50.94s]  My lights aren't even turned on. Yeah, I have one of those, like, click click lights. Hey, there we
[50.94s -> 62.97s]  go. Now I can see. Is this title too too much? I think it is. I kind of have to change this title.
[67.59s -> 72.20s]  The title is hurting me. Well, there's a reason why that I made the title the way it is.
[73.16s -> 78.04s]  Today we're going to play. Well, first of all, let's go right to business. Let's talk about
[78.04s -> 85.19s]  what's going on. Hey, how have you been? It's been a few days. I don't want to get right to business.
[85.99s -> 96.42s]  We actually got a couple things to talk about. Maybe one thing. It's hard to talk remotely
[96.42s -> 102.89s]  seriously when this is on my screen. I'm sitting here like, hey, let's talk about some serious
[102.89s -> 108.01s]  stuff. There's like a pancake blueberry guy dancing on the screen. How can I be serious?
[108.57s -> 120.26s]  That's what I have to look at. The title of this game is sometimes to deal with the difficulty
[120.26s -> 123.78s]  of being alive. I need to believe there's a possibility that life isn't real. That's the
[123.78s -> 137.32s]  name of this game. I would have abbreviated this. I don't think this even fits on Steam.
[138.04s -> 146.12s]  Does this dot dot dot at the end on Steam? You thought this was a joke? No, no, this is real.
[147.59s -> 152.39s]  Those of you that don't know, typically maybe 30, 40 minutes before a stream starts, I get in the
[152.39s -> 158.39s]  chat and we just talk. We go over lottery numbers. We go over our favorite animals.
[159.03s -> 162.15s]  And then sometimes we're talking about the game that's going to be played in the next 30, 40
[162.15s -> 167.27s]  minutes. So I did a poll, a couple of polls. Usually I throw it up there if I have like
[167.27s -> 172.07s]  something I like to do or something that I want to do. And everyone thought that this was fake,
[172.63s -> 179.22s]  that I was just putting this up here to be like a weirdo. No, this is an existential game. There's
[179.22s -> 186.84s]  no end. There's no beginning. You just play it. I don't know if this could be fun. Somebody
[186.84s -> 193.66s]  requested this. And I tell you, I take requests dead seriously. That recommendation channel,
[195.64s -> 203.51s]  if you have a recommendation, put it there. I look at it all the damn time. I am absolutely serious.
[204.49s -> 207.93s]  If you don't think, oh no, I'm not going to recommend that. There's no way he'll fucking
[207.93s -> 213.53s]  play it, right? No, there's no way. If I put something in that channel, is it possible that
[213.53s -> 221.77s]  he might just like glaze over it and and not care? And no, I think I'm good. I don't think
[221.77s -> 231.56s]  he'll play that. I don't think he ever would. Don't worry. If you got something interesting,
[231.56s -> 235.88s]  put it in that channel. I'm all about the interesting things. Why is there no audio?
[237.19s -> 253.32s]  No, that's why. Because there's music here, isn't there? Yes, there is. Well, now that makes more
[253.32s -> 262.62s]  sense is why the sprinkle bread guy is dancing. How long do you think I can stay on this screen
[262.62s -> 277.50s]  for? This is a starting soon screen. It just is. Hold on. Like, oh, that's a gerba is starting soon.
[278.14s -> 300.41s]  I need to see. Okay, we're gonna make that. Let's do orange or something. All right, here we go,
[300.41s -> 335.98s]  guys. Hey, let's turn the stream on. Starting the stream right now. Okay. Okay. Oh, hey,
[335.98s -> 346.82s]  hey, what's going on, guys? Hope you had a good day today. Me, Jeremy. Nice to see you. Happy
[346.82s -> 354.38s]  birthday to all of you birthday people out there today. Got a special one for you tonight.
[355.18s -> 360.15s]  Have you been playing? Sometimes there's a possibility that life and death are the same
[360.15s -> 364.47s]  thing and it's not even real in the first place. There's a possibility that I've never
[364.47s -> 372.22s]  found it to begin with. That's the name of the game we're playing. Let's go. All right. How do I?
[372.22s -> 380.94s]  All right. Hey, buddy. I'm going on vacation tomorrow for my birthday. I told you happy birthday.
[383.26s -> 388.63s]  Awesome. Happy birthday. Awesome. All right. There is no beginning and no end to this game.
[388.63s -> 401.37s]  Who's gonna go? I don't. I'm not even gonna get told how to control the game.
[402.62s -> 419.46s]  I have a traffic light on my back. There's a punch. Uh, okay. Try to examine the things over here.
[420.50s -> 429.94s]  Oh, there's a sprint. All right. So if this is, if I was making a video right now,
[429.94s -> 433.14s]  okay, you ready? Those of you that are like, oh, man, remember, remember when he used to make
[433.14s -> 439.24s]  videos? What I would do here is after about a minute is like, what, what just happened right
[439.24s -> 443.72s]  there? Like, oh, how do I play this? Left click, right click. Oh, I don't know. There would be a
[443.72s -> 448.52s]  cut right here and it would cut to police sirens and wanted stars in the top right. And I'd be
[448.52s -> 452.52s]  running around like punching and screaming and stuff. That would be like the joke for this part.
[457.96s -> 461.32s]  That's what I would do. I'm not even 10 seconds into the game and I know that's what I would do.
[467.37s -> 479.06s]  Is this an NPC? I want to chat. Uh, okay. I thought he was grabbing me. I thought he was grabbing
[479.06s -> 495.43s]  me one star. Uh, I don't think I want to do this. I'm busy. Can't talk now. I don't like this. I
[495.43s -> 509.58s]  don't like what's going on here. Hey, you're so dumb. You think I'm a computer. Obviously I'm not.
[514.02s -> 520.70s]  Uh, who's running around with these people in the background? What? Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[520.70s -> 524.30s]  What's going on in the background? That's important. There's like a half house there.
[524.94s -> 529.42s]  Where are you from? Um, I'm not, I'm never gonna tell anybody where you from online.
[531.69s -> 537.69s]  What are you doing? I was gonna write like Ohio. Did you just converse with a human?
[538.73s -> 552.39s]  That was a machine. Lost one. Yes. Hold on. What? Oh, it's, it's people. There are people.
[553.11s -> 576.44s]  There are no people in this game. What do I have to do? What happened? Did it break? Uh,
[577.40s -> 583.19s]  oh, I just lost my HUD. Is this part of like the existential part of the game?
[599.74s -> 603.18s]  Sometimes to understand the actuality of the universe, you have to fucking combine two or
[603.18s -> 642.86s]  three atoms in the root of all square roots. I'm coming back. Hold on. Come on. I still think it's
[642.86s -> 651.24s]  funny. And that's all I care about. I think that's funny. Some of you comedy fucking scholars,
[651.24s -> 656.09s]  maybe a little bit. I think that's funny. All right. Single player. What the fuck's happening?
[664.63s -> 675.82s]  How do I get out of this place? I just want to play the game. Okay. That's clearly not a robot.
[675.82s -> 685.59s]  I don't think this is a robot. How do I talk to this person? Go away. I'm swimming. I want to talk
[685.59s -> 694.42s]  to you. Come here. Go away. This is not my head. Oh, go away. I'm picking up items. This is not,
[694.42s -> 708.98s]  we're even picking up items. Two. Did I get two items? Press E to interact. This is a guy from
[708.98s -> 714.34s]  Pee Wee Herman. An artist was secretly hired by the Bolsheviks when he was 14 to try and ruin
[714.34s -> 719.86s]  Western culture. He becomes an egomaniacal misogynist who hides gold bars under his bed.
[719.86s -> 730.01s]  Everyone loves him and admires him. Institutions teach children to be like him. Um, that's a little
[730.01s -> 733.29s]  too deep for Pee Wee Herman. Can you just say the word of the day? It's like sofa.
[734.17s -> 742.52s]  Ah! Would you like to play pizza in the woods? No. Wait, should I have said yes?
[742.52s -> 755.19s]  Somebody's just lying on the ground. Oh, I got something. Turning on radio.
[767.70s -> 774.02s]  Is this a real song? No, no, no. This is a real song. This is a, no, of course it is. No,
[774.10s -> 783.24s]  you just, okay, go away. I'm in a conversation. Holy shit. Is this music? Is this music?
[784.44s -> 795.80s]  What a sick computer set. Look at that. That person is all over the place. That's fucking
[795.80s -> 801.32s]  Bitcoin. That's fucking Ethereum. That's gold, silver, platinum. That's all.
[803.24s -> 807.32s]  Except if it was gold, it would be pretty high.
[811.03s -> 816.15s]  I just, I want to go near the song. A capitalist buys up all the aspirin to control the headache
[816.15s -> 821.51s]  market. He stores it in a giant warehouse just outside the city. One hot day, the aspirin melts
[821.51s -> 826.47s]  and forms the largest privately owned lake in the country. It costs 10 bucks for a swim.
[827.67s -> 833.88s]  I feel like this is, you put on headphones and you walk around and press the buttons at the museum.
[834.68s -> 843.13s]  Now stop playing music! The beginning of every fucking battle royale game.
[843.85s -> 848.90s]  All we need is the guy that crawls around, the three people that crawl around prone,
[848.90s -> 851.54s]  and then the one guy that punches everybody in the face like over and over again. All right,
[851.54s -> 861.85s]  I'm talking to you. Come here. I feel like I've done this move before. On camera. I have. I've
[861.85s -> 874.71s]  done that exact fucking move and you've seen it like a thousand times. All right, I'm going
[874.71s -> 882.34s]  to go play the pizza one. How do we do anything? I thought I was supposed to be only, okay, here we go.
[887.21s -> 898.57s]  Hey, where are you from? From Ohio. I hate my job.
[899.13s -> 917.53s]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That was a machine. All right, let's go play the pizza game.
[918.25s -> 932.58s]  What am I gaining here? I'm gaining some kind of weird currency. Pizza in the woods, a walking
[932.58s -> 937.22s]  simulator. Leave idle and pizza will walk and fly by himself or explore on your own with WASD in
[937.22s -> 940.90s]  the mouth. There are things to see in four corners of the forest and a lake to swim in. Hit escape
[940.90s -> 946.73s]  to return to Polly's pond. I feel like that's something nobody wants to do on his own.
[954.14s -> 957.02s]  All right, so my hand, I'm just watching this with you guys. We're watching the same thing.
[957.66s -> 965.83s]  There's nothing more hilarious than the urgent care waiting room. What the fuck is going on?
[966.55s -> 980.86s]  Fires on cocaine and the elephants have learned to use email. They're writing letters to giant
[980.86s -> 986.22s]  squid who are saving their ink for perfume that makes bats horny. The bats are making babies to
[986.22s -> 992.70s]  replace the supreme court justices. It's all been signed off on set of four. Annex is playing the
[992.70s -> 997.58s]  flute on top of it. This is what happens when you take a dose higher than you're supposed to
[997.58s -> 1003.42s]  take of acid. First of all, just don't do it. I'm not going to condone any of that.
[1005.10s -> 1008.94s]  Don't take drugs, ever. Don't take too many of them because they end up writing a sentence.
[1010.78s -> 1017.14s]  I see that person in the corner with their eyes wide open saying all these things. Just don't do
[1017.14s -> 1024.23s]  drugs. They're not good for you. Take Tylenol. If you've got a headache, take Tylenol. Aspirin.
[1024.47s -> 1028.79s]  I did just say the thing that the museum button press thing just told you not to do.
[1033.27s -> 1037.19s]  It's documented evidence of why things like marijuana are beneficial to the human body
[1037.19s -> 1045.19s]  taken in the right way. It's good for pain relief and especially for irritable bowel disease as
[1045.19s -> 1051.82s]  well. Just want to make sure everyone's aware of that. Be careful when you do drugs. If you
[1051.82s -> 1062.86s]  don't do them, just don't do them. Can I have control again? I have no more control. A pizza
[1062.94s -> 1080.90s]  like Pizza Paul, whatever his name is. What am I throwing? Are those jacks?
[1083.24s -> 1094.34s]  If you can just do something different than your parents, it is a major accomplishment.
[1097.66s -> 1111.51s]  These are just acid fortune cookies. Oh, something's going on here. Why is this
[1111.51s -> 1130.12s]  getting so laggy? All right, what is laptop lap dance? Return to main level. How do I
[1130.12s -> 1137.83s]  teleport? Return to main level. Should I find something in here? There's probably something
[1137.83s -> 1151.88s]  in here to do. Hey, you want to ditch the stream and light up? No, I can't, man. I can't.
[1154.12s -> 1168.15s]  All right. I can't, man. What is this? Should I go to find the laptop? There's like two rockets
[1168.15s -> 1173.59s]  and stuff apparently out here. There's things to see in the corners. There we go. I found it.
[1174.31s -> 1180.31s]  I found the portal. I can't wait until the wild development team. I know I make a wild reference
[1180.31s -> 1185.98s]  every single stream, but I have to. That's the portal. That's the original portal in what was
[1185.98s -> 1191.50s]  the name of the zone for the Emerald Nightmare, the Emerald Dream. That was the Emerald Dream
[1191.50s -> 1195.02s]  portal. It was right behind a dragon. There were four dragons in the world. What was his name?
[1196.78s -> 1204.90s]  Duskwood, right? That portal that was behind. What was the dragon's name? It was in there for
[1205.06s -> 1227.50s]  eight years. I'm not telling a joke. I'm giving a wild reference. What is this? Toilet? All right.
[1238.46s -> 1277.30s]  How many more times am I going to do it? Is it naked? What? Holy shit. What is that?
[1278.10s -> 1294.54s]  Well, this looks different. Is that pencil? Whoa. Is it an actual pencil NPC?
[1295.26s -> 1311.11s]  How do you talk to the pencil? Holy shit, dude. Duskwood. Okay. This is somebody's house. I don't
[1311.11s -> 1324.81s]  like this. I want to go through this quickly. I don't like this tunnel. What am I doing? What's
[1324.81s -> 1335.64s]  going on? Why am I sitting? What do you mean you can't believe that? That sounds awesome.
[1338.49s -> 1363.06s]  That's not it. No, I get it. You guys thought this was going to be like a meme. You know,
[1363.06s -> 1373.96s]  this is like an existential fucking like serious game. Why is it dark? All right. I kind of want
[1373.96s -> 1385.67s]  to get away with getting from the pizza place. I want to get out of the pizza place. This gives
[1385.67s -> 1392.15s]  me like freaking me out. A fox and a cricket develop a deep friendship in the Buruburu forest,
[1392.15s -> 1395.91s]  but the humans are encroaching with their subdivisions and shopping malls.
[1395.91s -> 1400.39s]  The fox and the cricket organize all the animals in the forest and they commit group suicide.
[1401.35s -> 1428.23s]  All right. So, um, can I do the test again? Run. I'm going up here. Is there anywhere else I can go?
[1432.25s -> 1451.94s]  Bed? Painting? I can't like hold down and go like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Something going on
[1451.94s -> 1485.48s]  over here. There's a guitar hero controller. Give me some music. I don't want to do it.
[1486.12s -> 1495.00s]  I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. I have to. I can't help it.
[1508.28s -> 1515.08s]  I can't stop. I can't stop. I need to do it.
[1518.15s -> 1524.87s]  It's all I care about. I don't care about anything else. I'm losing my mind right now.
[1524.87s -> 1531.14s]  Wait, wait, just wait. Just wait, wait. Okay.
[1560.30s -> 1573.83s]  I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. People are probably fucking pissed. I can't help it. Okay. What else
[1573.83s -> 1577.75s]  can I do? That's the only thing I've been able to do in this game is just zoom in on people doing
[1577.75s -> 1583.11s]  that dance. I really should be paying attention to the message that the game is trying to convey,
[1583.11s -> 1588.31s]  right? Like the messages and the things that you should be thinking about. All right.
[1589.99s -> 1599.45s]  What the fuck was that? Somebody's driving by really fast in a car with windows down.
[1600.41s -> 1604.41s]  You know, I love, anytime that happens, I laugh my ass off. When you get this like,
[1604.41s -> 1611.16s]  oh, it's coming from over here. You know, like you're at a red light and the guy,
[1611.16s -> 1615.40s]  somebody pulls up next to you and you hear it. You're talking like your mother in the front seat.
[1615.40s -> 1620.04s]  Like, oh yeah, I really do think that it's, yeah, I think that the best part about,
[1620.12s -> 1625.64s]  um, uh, yeah, no, no, yeah, that will get milked too.
[1633.03s -> 1636.55s]  Look at that windows down. You got your windows down. Is anybody going to roll them up?
[1637.75s -> 1641.43s]  No, the person is going to be like, just get fucking rolling his windows up. You don't like
[1641.43s -> 1650.79s]  my music. Topical stand up. You know, you know, when you pull it up at a red light.
[1651.83s -> 1665.59s]  So I did say that this is going to be, I did say I've been, I've been very clear that we were
[1665.59s -> 1670.23s]  going to either play this for 30 minutes or two hours and it's been 30 in 30 minutes. What was
[1670.23s -> 1697.43s]  that? Is it stack city? Yeah. Okay. This is a lot. We got, try to read this. I'm not going to read
[1697.43s -> 1711.14s]  this. Should I read this whole thing? That's too many. That's too many words. I think picture a
[1711.14s -> 1714.82s]  dark room in your head. It's night. Maybe just a little bit of moonlight is creeping in through a
[1714.82s -> 1719.06s]  window so you can just make out some of the silhouettes of some objects. The pictures on
[1719.06s -> 1723.38s]  the wall are black. The couch is black. The table is black. The lamp over the couch is black. The
[1723.38s -> 1730.34s]  air is dark blue. Take out the ceiling. Look at the room from above. All you see is blue and black.
[1730.34s -> 1734.98s]  Now turn on a lamp in the room. It spreads over everything. The pictures are white. The couch and
[1734.98s -> 1740.34s]  rug are over saturated warm colors. Yellow is pouring out from the window. It's so bright. It
[1740.34s -> 1746.10s]  hurts your eyes and you have to squint, but you stay in the room anyway and bask in the glow.
[1746.10s -> 1753.72s]  You feel so nice. Now there's a light on your head. And let me tell you something, Larry. Get
[1753.72s -> 1776.78s]  the fuck out of here. Now there's a light in your head. That's one of the best shows of all time,
[1776.78s -> 1780.46s]  by the way. Kirby Enthusiasm is one of the best fucking comedic actors. Some of the best comedy.
[1781.02s -> 1784.30s]  Just true quick witted fucking real comedians. Not me.
[1785.59s -> 1790.55s]  Bart Simpson. No, no, no, no. Bart Simpson's not part of that group. I just saw that and had to say
[1790.55s -> 1802.10s]  it and I think that's Bart Simpson. Okay. What do I press? No, no, no, no. This is another one of
[1802.10s -> 1817.02s]  these. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Here we go. I had somebody wash my face with rose water.
[1822.87s -> 1826.31s]  My bedroom window, but I don't think I could actually see it. Okay. Well, what else is going
[1826.31s -> 1834.54s]  on? Let's think about the private parts of my ancestors. How much they... I don't want to think
[1834.54s -> 1841.14s]  about that. I really don't want to think about that. I'm not sure I want to. I don't want to
[1841.14s -> 1854.31s]  look at it. I don't want to look at this one either. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it.
[1865.16s -> 1896.07s]  I need to fix it. It's wrong. One of these times I'm going to do this and I'm actually just going
[1896.07s -> 1900.79s]  to get up and fucking leave for like five minutes. I will drop a thousand viewers, but like, I don't
[1900.79s -> 1917.24s]  know. It might be worth it. In the shower, my girlfriend art pieces is when a Russian cosmonaut
[1917.24s -> 1920.84s]  plugged a hole in the international space station with a thumb knife. But Billy Hilliard's space
[1920.84s -> 1925.43s]  was prevented from seeping into the astronaut's small living pot. Since the thumb around the same
[1925.43s -> 1929.03s]  time back on Earth, they're already receiving a real astronaut breakdown. He's advanced nothing
[1929.03s -> 1933.59s]  into space, aspiring with corrupt leadership to take a branch on Earth's improbable complexity.
[1934.39s -> 1962.97s]  That's like an emote. That's the emote I would expect to like have like react to this. We've got
[1962.97s -> 1972.68s]  some overlap here. Let's get to the frame. Let's get to the top. In the shower, my girlfriend
[1973.48s -> 1982.87s]  from a young age, William Blake, I don't... This is freaking me out. I don't like this. And maybe
[1982.87s -> 1999.59s]  it's... Maybe that's by design. Homo sapiens die off. Some of the computers we program to act like
[1999.59s -> 2005.51s]  us live on. What if a future homo sapien, homo species, is able to communicate with us through
[2005.51s -> 2010.47s]  our AI? Will they be convinced to click on links that claim to forgive their mortgages and have
[2010.47s -> 2014.47s]  pictures of large breasts over they have a conversation that inspires them and makes them
[2014.47s -> 2029.74s]  miss us? Holy shit. That's a good point. That's a great point. What will they do?
[2029.74s -> 2043.14s]  What the hell's gonna happen? I think the five-point narrative structure has ran its course,
[2043.14s -> 2047.86s]  homelining with the Sopranos. Lately, when I put on a movie or TV show, I get so bored and barely pay
[2047.86s -> 2052.66s]  attention. I browse the web and send messages. I just want bright, warm lights on all around me.
[2052.66s -> 2056.98s]  Things to glance at and be reminded I'm not alone in the universe. I don't know. Five-point structure
[2057.70s -> 2075.43s]  I mean, it's... The Sopranos is one of the best TV shows ever made. I mean, I want your... I want
[2075.43s -> 2079.51s]  your character creator because I definitely would make something like this in like the journal
[2079.51s -> 2091.03s]  record. I would love this creator. Give me one of these WWE. I love the idea of a tulpa, a spiritual
[2091.03s -> 2095.59s]  being you make with your focused mind that acts independently from them. I'm always having dreams
[2095.59s -> 2099.03s]  where I interact with people I've never seen in waking life. That's true. Happens to me too.
[2099.03s -> 2103.75s]  I've fallen in love and grown very angry with people that don't exist. I probably have a lot of
[2103.75s -> 2107.67s]  tulpas in me I could create if I ever really concentrate. A capacity for creating
[2107.67s -> 2112.23s]  analogical spaces could be the greatest thing about us or make us the shortest surviving of
[2112.23s -> 2121.51s]  all the species. Dude, I... I'm telling you, I've had dreams before where like I had this... It's
[2121.51s -> 2128.79s]  like me and my dad in our house, but it's just some bald guy with a mustache. My dad does not
[2128.79s -> 2139.78s]  have a mustache. I am of like Irish and Polish descent and like this guy in my dream
[2140.26s -> 2144.90s]  he's in like a few of them is like an Italian guy. He's like an Italian guy with a mustache.
[2144.90s -> 2161.10s]  He's not my dad. So I don't know. I have no idea why. Why does that happen? It's not Mario. Oh,
[2161.10s -> 2174.41s]  you guys, it's not fucking Mario. It's just... It's what it just is. I play too many video games
[2174.41s -> 2181.45s]  and fucking Mario has been burned in my brain as like dad. That's also kind of messed up
[2181.45s -> 2191.14s]  and maybe that's... What's going on? I want to keep... What's going on? Trees. Trees. Gathering.
[2191.14s -> 2205.22s]  Gathering. Humans. One human at Pala... Pawn. So? What the fuck? Oh, I forgot to tell you guys this
[2205.22s -> 2208.26s]  story. It's about sleeping. This is important. This has nothing to do with anything going on
[2208.26s -> 2213.62s]  the screen. Nothing at all. So, um, you know, every so often I tell you guys a story about like
[2213.62s -> 2218.50s]  Kim and I with some like weird shit happens when we're in the same... We're sleeping in the same
[2218.50s -> 2225.14s]  room sometimes. Like she'll have a dream or I'll have like a dream or something funny will happen.
[2225.14s -> 2231.30s]  So why are you rezzing sleeper? I don't even... This is fucking fun. This is a funny story and
[2231.30s -> 2235.78s]  I'm gonna tell it and I don't even care if you think it's a boring story. I thought it was funny
[2235.78s -> 2240.58s]  and that's what we do on this stream. We talk about funny things that happen in my... What a crazy
[2240.58s -> 2247.46s]  fucking life, right? What a wild life I have, right? Listen to me. All right. So Kim gets up
[2247.46s -> 2251.38s]  sometimes in the middle of the night and then goes to the bathroom. I do it too, but I was dead
[2251.38s -> 2256.66s]  asleep. I'm lying on my back and I'm dead asleep and I heard her start to move around and start to
[2256.66s -> 2261.62s]  stir, if you will, right? So she kind of turns and she sits on the edge of the bed and that's
[2261.62s -> 2266.34s]  when I started to wake up and I didn't know... I didn't see what she was doing. I'm looking at her
[2266.34s -> 2270.74s]  back, right? So her back and the back of her head. So she's sitting on the edge of the bed and she
[2270.74s -> 2276.04s]  leans forward and this is the first thing I remember. My eyes just open. I see this. I hear
[2279.70s -> 2284.66s]  and she leaned forward. I thought she shit diarrhea in her pants. Just like leaning forward,
[2284.66s -> 2291.67s]  just shitting her pants, but she was blowing her nose, but in my... I just barely got out of sleep
[2291.67s -> 2299.05s]  in my... I'm... I just am becoming conscious. I was just like, what are you doing? Are you okay?
[2300.55s -> 2303.91s]  He's like, why would anybody sit up on the edge of bed, lean forward and just
[2305.58s -> 2318.31s]  fucking... You know what? What? I really thought it happened. It was a huge nose blow.
[2318.31s -> 2325.05s]  That's a funny story. That's a funny like, be it my girlfriend, you know, like funny things.
[2325.05s -> 2335.83s]  Why is that a story? Because we're talking about sleep and dreams and stuff. What? You don't think
[2335.83s -> 2346.34s]  that that's like a humorous story? That's not even a boomer story. Was it a boomer story?
[2352.98s -> 2357.53s]  I thought it was really funny. Oh, we have something else.
[2357.53s -> 2363.29s]  A man is so anxious he can't stop grinding his teeth. He grinds them so hard they start to break.
[2363.93s -> 2369.13s]  This makes him even more nervous and he starts to grind the broken teeth into his gums as he
[2369.13s -> 2374.62s]  gurgles while his mouth is dripping blood. I don't want to listen to that. Can I light off?
[2375.74s -> 2388.47s]  Cut to power. Can I get up there? Would you like to play the founders now? Oh god, I don't know.
[2388.47s -> 2399.61s]  The central nervous gives you a version of reality that keeps it comfortable.
[2400.49s -> 2407.93s]  To exist is to have a body. To have a body is to have limited understanding.
[2408.65s -> 2416.33s]  Suddenly you find your consciousness far away from your flesh and your awareness drifting to
[2416.33s -> 2426.20s]  wherever and is very slowly blending with a universal laziness that shrouds all sentience.
[2426.20s -> 2438.28s]  Why did somebody say ASMR truck? It's not truck. That is not actual TOS. What? What are you talking
[2438.28s -> 2449.05s]  about? What do you mean? Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. What? What's
[2449.05s -> 2455.99s]  going on? What's going on? A break dancer with ice cream zits. An alien reggae band using
[2455.99s -> 2463.51s]  dismembered chimeras as instruments. Everyone's listening to radio stations from across earth
[2463.51s -> 2469.59s]  trying to make sense of humanity. The more they try to make sense the less sense there is.
[2470.23s -> 2477.35s]  The founders of Daytona Beach also founded Dayton, Ohio. Stock trading through Vedic ritual.
[2477.99s -> 2485.35s]  Decapitated heads telling sci-fi stories to walls. A green cowboy stuck inside a wooden temple.
[2486.39s -> 2494.62s]  I don't understand. Is it like something at the end? If you want your body back you need to
[2494.62s -> 2504.36s]  pronounce a seven syllable word three times. It is a vibration key to a corporate figure out your
[2504.36s -> 2513.50s]  work and you will return to a body. Seven syllable word. Supercalifragilisticexpial. That's
[2513.50s -> 2576.65s]  like 12. Never mind. I need a seven syllable word. No. I'm not going to do it twice. Whoa.
[2578.01s -> 2588.81s]  Isn't that thing just... Everybody always makes these horror game things and these scary monsters
[2588.81s -> 2595.29s]  and oh my god look out it's the lady with the long hair and the coat on or whatever and they
[2595.53s -> 2599.29s]  know if this thing's sprinting full speed down like an alley screaming
[2599.29s -> 2602.09s]  this will be way scarier than like the guy from Outlast.
[2625.59s -> 2667.06s]  There's nobody dancing here. Is this a band song? All right if I do that joke again I want 100
[2667.06s -> 2673.64s]  people to unsubscribe. If I do that joke one more time I want 100 people to unsubscribe.
[2676.47s -> 2680.60s]  Ugh. Mouth? Oh it's an eye. Whatever it is. What did I just pick up?
[2690.52s -> 2693.08s]  Do I have to collect all the things? Is it going to bite me?
[2720.34s -> 2730.31s]  This is very strange. I guess this is weird. This is strange. Am I not tall enough to go over here?
[2730.31s -> 2742.46s]  What's that? R1. Do I have to press R1 on the controller? I like that. I like that little guy.
[2747.13s -> 2751.93s]  Now that's cool. I know what that feels like. You know when you just look at something I know it's
[2751.93s -> 2757.29s]  like a leather. It's like a nice smooth leathery feel. I know what that feels like. I want that.
[2757.29s -> 2761.93s]  I'm gonna feel that right now. I want to like raise my hand over that like soft like very smooth
[2761.93s -> 2801.54s]  leather. I'm losing 100 subs. Got my finger on the unsub button. Am I just talking to this thing?
[2807.83s -> 2811.27s]  Don't don't don't don't what do you mean don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't
[2811.43s -> 2816.63s]  go upstairs don't go upstairs don't go up don't do it don't is this like something up here

[3361.70s -> 3369.56s]  not gonna do multiplayer in this game if it even still works
[3379.82s -> 3385.82s]  multiplayer in a game like this is probably just like hey come on in anybody and fucking

[3608.86s -> 3629.64s]  all right so how close was i what's the name of the game uh greg 39 gathering gathering i can make
[3629.64s -> 3638.28s]  them do things this is like a weird idol game out here they can like build more town sometimes to
[3638.28s -> 3641.56s]  deal with the difficulty of being alive and to believe there's a possibility that life is not
[3641.64s -> 3647.88s]  real who's to say there is something about life to which is it even real or not all right that's
[3647.88s -> 3660.54s]  close enough i don't think i have to deduct very many points i get like a 75 visiting secret lair
[3661.35s -> 3680.28s]  i didn't do that all right i apparently am visiting the secret lair am i in their brains
[3685.50s -> 3697.34s]  what hey i wasn't done i actually wasn't done i don't get this thing going is this a person
[3698.14s -> 3720.50s]  or is this a person's clothes i think this is their clothes yeah that's like a sweatshirt right
[3720.50s -> 3734.34s]  i think so go away and pray all right i think that about sums it up no i'm not gonna do it
[3734.34s -> 3743.38s]  that's too late for that i already read over it i've already read over it i've read over it
[3743.38s -> 3758.18s]  i can't do it again see he stopped doing it no i can't do it all right let's play metal wolf chaos
[3758.90s -> 3763.74s]  that was a nice little beginning to the stream this is a request and it was pretty interesting
[3763.74s -> 3769.32s]  it was pretty weird it was all kind of out there you're forgetting the xd i know and whatever
[3774.28s -> 3782.46s]  that was called there is something to say about life and death to bring yourself to the
[3782.46s -> 3787.50s]  realization that it might not be real it's just type in there is something into steam and you'll
[3787.50s -> 3789.58s]  find it i think that's the only one that has that
