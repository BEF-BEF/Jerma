[21.37s -> 46.30s]  Hey what's up? What's up? Today's the day. Final Fantasy 16 is out! I've actually been waiting
[46.30s -> 52.86s]  for this. I had a lot of fun with the demo. I'll give you a quick little update of what the plan
[52.86s -> 60.09s]  is before we get started. What about where's the smurf report? Well, what the fuck is that?
[60.89s -> 67.64s]  Why did somebody just electrocute the chat with one... was it a euro? What was that?
[68.28s -> 70.92s]  Is there... why is there money? Wait, what are these different...
[71.56s -> 83.82s]  is there one euro at the top? Is there a new money thing? Do you see this? What is this?
[85.93s -> 100.81s]  Hype. Derma Go. Why is it gone? When are you gonna take the dino quiz? What on earth is happening?
[101.37s -> 108.26s]  Okay, this is weird. I feel like I'm... I feel like I'm playing a like mobile game and I have to like
[108.26s -> 111.94s]  press these to get them. If I don't touch these at the top, I feel like I don't get them.
[112.50s -> 115.56s]  And then they disappear. So if I don't click them, do they go away?
[120.22s -> 124.94s]  Okay, I just to make sure everyone's aware of this. I think you're giving real money.
[124.94s -> 128.86s]  Just to make sure you're clear on that. You guys are giving real money right now. I don't know.
[128.86s -> 137.59s]  I don't know what this is. But just be aware. This is you're spending real money. What is it?
[137.59s -> 150.33s]  Okay. Well, interesting. I think they know. Play Kingdom Hearts. Hold on. Hold on a second.
[150.33s -> 165.08s]  I think it's bugs in your brain making you see things. If this is... If this sticks around,
[165.08s -> 168.12s]  I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna make... I think I might have to make a few changes.
[172.68s -> 177.00s]  Does it... Can I... How do... All right. Well, this is interesting. All right. Anyways, hello.
[177.00s -> 188.34s]  Welcome, everybody. Today, I'm gonna be playing Final Fantasy 16. Sponsored stream. Thank you to
[188.34s -> 193.14s]  Square Enix for sponsoring this stream. I'm very excited to play it. I don't know if it was...
[193.14s -> 196.42s]  Probably wasn't hard to tell at the end of the demo, but I genuinely think this is gonna be
[196.42s -> 205.96s]  really fun. And here's the best part. The best part is we don't have to do the demo again.
[206.90s -> 213.66s]  You start right from where we left off in the demo. Are you gonna do Next Fest? I am. I'm gonna...
[214.22s -> 218.86s]  So here's the thing. I was thinking about doing half the stream Final Fantasy and then half the
[218.86s -> 231.53s]  stream as the Next Fest. But I'd rather just do it this weekend and play Sorcery this weekend.
[232.33s -> 245.08s]  And okay. Hold on a second. Let me just do one thing real quick. Where the hell is your face?
[245.88s -> 257.78s]  My face is hanging out. Sorcery needs its own stream. We'll figure it out. Don't worry. Don't
[257.78s -> 265.86s]  worry. So wait, these are pinned... These are pinned messages and they stay up longer depending
[265.86s -> 271.26s]  on... Well, I just want to make it really clear. I am not clicking on any of these. So just to be
[271.26s -> 275.18s]  aware, they stay up longer depending on how much money you give. I just want to make sure
[275.18s -> 279.03s]  everyone's aware. I'm not... I haven't clicked on any of them. I think the point is like I'm
[279.03s -> 283.75s]  supposed to click on these and be like, oh, this person has a chat pinned up here. They're all
[283.75s -> 287.03s]  gone by the time I click on them. I'm not gonna click on any of these. I just want to make sure
[287.03s -> 293.69s]  you know that. Well, I'll click on this one. This one says the CCO of Offbrand calls hype chats.
[294.94s -> 306.04s]  What? So I've said my thing. I'm not gonna click on any of these.
[306.84s -> 313.02s]  I'm sorry, but like maybe I don't know. Let me... Let's just go through today and I'll figure out
[313.02s -> 333.66s]  if I want to keep that or not. Okay. Okay. Streamers, you can't tell how much they're really
[333.66s -> 342.62s]  spending. Yeah. Some of them are just different currencies. I feel like I'm like Forex trading
[342.62s -> 349.19s]  in my chat room. Like a Canadian and then we have like English pounds and we all... I feel like I'm
[349.27s -> 369.56s]  trading up here like Forex. Well, all right. So that's a feature now, just so you know.
[370.84s -> 375.72s]  Let's make it really clear. I just said it. I ain't reading any of this. So just to let you know,
[375.72s -> 380.68s]  I know we have this policy where I don't really read anything that comes in monetarily, but that
[380.68s -> 385.88s]  also applies to here. I'm not gonna read any of these. Just to let you know, I have to be
[387.00s -> 392.12s]  consistent and I got to be transparent with you. There you go. Okay. I appreciate it nonetheless,
[392.12s -> 398.66s]  but thank you. But let's, let's go. Let's go. I ain't reading all that. No, not an,
[398.66s -> 412.33s]  I ain't reading all that. I just, I ain't reading all that. Wait, wait a second. Hold on.
[413.29s -> 421.26s]  You cannot opt out of hype chat as we wanted to, but you can set a minimum. You can set a minimum
[421.26s -> 433.08s]  of a hundred dollars. Okay. Well, let's just, I'm just going to leave it as it, but you know,
[433.08s -> 437.99s]  make it like, I don't know. I can't make, I, you know what? We're going to have to, I think.
[441.37s -> 446.17s]  All right. Just, it's a new feature. It's there. Let's just play. Let's play. I got a sponsorship
[446.17s -> 451.53s]  for you to do right now. You know what I'm saying? Set it at like a billion dollars. So nobody can do
[451.53s -> 467.98s]  it. You must read them. No, now run ads. No, I'm not doing anything. All right. I'm, I have a,
[467.98s -> 475.96s]  let's go. It'll, it'll play out for a little bit. It's all right. I appreciate it nonetheless,
[475.96s -> 483.72s]  but I ain't reading all that. All right. There you go. If, if, if we need to make it a little
[483.72s -> 488.84s]  higher, so it's not spammed, we will, but it's a new feature, I guess. Cool. Okay. Anyways,
[489.40s -> 500.25s]  Final Fantasy 16. Wow. Wowee. Here it is. Get to pick up right where we left off in the demo.
[505.21s -> 513.70s]  I'm excited. I cannot wait to hear that battle music like a thousand more times. Yes, it is an
[513.70s -> 521.77s]  ad. This is hashtag ad. This is sponsored by Square Enix. Keep that in mind, but I'm having
[522.82s -> 531.90s]  a blast in the demo. It seems like I'm, I don't know. I, I'm, I think this is going to be pretty
[531.90s -> 538.55s]  gosh darn fun. All right. You guys ready? Let's go. You want to, you get a face game if you're good.
[538.55s -> 546.23s]  You'll get a face game if you're good. Only if you're good. All right. So I'm gonna,
[546.23s -> 558.90s]  it's probably this one here. What about the Super Mario RPG remake? Huh? What are you talking about?
[558.90s -> 568.90s]  What are you talking about? He's making stuff up. It's real.
[573.22s -> 585.08s]  I like when people make up. It's real. Uh, no, that's cool. I'm glad they didn't just
[585.72s -> 592.57s]  port it. Uh, I'm excited. Hopefully it's really good. I'm looking forward to it. That's, I mean,
[592.57s -> 596.25s]  I feel like collectively everybody that has that in their top 10 favorite games of all time,
[596.89s -> 601.93s]  I think everybody just kind of had a sigh of relief when they did that first little intro
[601.93s -> 608.57s]  when it was like, okay, this is a port. And then they did the, wait a minute. Here comes the
[608.57s -> 612.81s]  magical star that's flying over and turning everything to 3D. I think everyone was like,
[612.81s -> 623.96s]  oh, okay. Oh, okay. This is real. Yeah. Uh, I would, I would be lying to you if I didn't tell you.
[623.96s -> 630.38s]  I was not excited for that because it seems cool. All right. Ready? I am excited. If you don't know
[630.38s -> 637.22s]  the story of Final Fantasy 16, uh, you probably have to go watch the VOD, but the game is officially
[637.22s -> 644.74s]  out. It's out right now. It launched today. PlayStation five. Let's freaking go. Additional
[644.74s -> 648.42s]  content is now available for redemption. These items can be claimed from the system tab. Ooh.
[650.81s -> 668.66s]  All right. Let's do it. This should pick up right with the demo left off. Yeah. It'll pick up 13
[668.66s -> 681.96s]  years after the demo. Wait, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. Is it correct? Welcome back. Sorry.
[681.96s -> 691.98s]  What's our situation? Let's just say Shiva and Titans little spat hasn't made things any easier.
[692.86s -> 709.77s]  Lord check. No, wait. Good call. Let's just get a quick little rundown. Wait, what? Lord check.
[712.47s -> 717.67s]  Wyvern. Oh, that's okay. All right. I remember. I remember. Yes. Yes. But at the very end,
[717.67s -> 721.11s]  we were, we were a soldier now. All right. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. All right. Good thing.
[721.11s -> 727.53s]  This exists. I swear. I'm telling you. Slave soldier for the Holy empire of Sam Brickay. Now
[727.53s -> 732.95s]  in his 13th year of servitude, drafted as a frontline infantryman, the magical might granted
[732.95s -> 737.83s]  him by the blessing of the phoenix quickly saw him promoted to an elite squadron of assassins.
[737.83s -> 744.18s]  He was assigned the moniker by which he is now known. Interesting. Okay. I am really glad this
[744.18s -> 750.92s]  exists because I was going to just ask why the fuck is this guy's name not Clive? I was like,
[750.92s -> 763.10s]  what happened? Oh, right. Bastards. Okay. Unit of Imperial army assassin tasked with taking the
[763.10s -> 781.91s]  head of the iron kingdom's dominant warden of ice and vessel of the icon Shiva. Got it. Go. And
[781.91s -> 787.18s]  it's as you thought, the crusaders have sounded the retreat. Then we follow.
[789.24s -> 795.32s]  We need to change your title. Well, if we return without Shiva's head, our fate will be no different
[795.32s -> 801.32s]  from Beasts. I'll take my chances with the iron blood. At least then I might die fighting
[803.91s -> 816.73s]  after you do. That is the misleading title right now. No, it's not. No, it's not. When I get
[816.73s -> 826.39s]  control, I tweeted that too. Not today. Then it's settled. No dying. Now, if you don't mind,
[826.39s -> 839.19s]  we have an army to chase. Go. All right. A chance encounter. The iconic abilities,
[839.19s -> 844.23s]  scarlet cyclone and heat wave for the phoenix are now available for acquisition and upgrade
[844.23s -> 849.03s]  on the abilities tab in the main menu. Do not forget that once acquired new abilities must
[849.03s -> 853.83s]  be equipped on the gear and icons tab. How do they expect us to kill something that can do this?
[854.23s -> 861.75s]  They don't. Only the girl holding its leash. They now it's not misleading anymore.
[867.90s -> 870.22s]  I have to make sure my tweet and my title makes sense.
[878.87s -> 886.92s]  Should I keep the, um, this control scheme? I feel like if it now is time to learn how to
[886.92s -> 903.98s]  do the other one or go to the, um, what is it? Type B, right? What sprint does sprint, right?
[904.78s -> 923.67s]  Ooh, do type B. It's going to be way better in the long run. Uh huh. So I want to do
[925.85s -> 936.39s]  type B. It is on type B. Okay. All right. So that this is circle is evade. I'm going to take a
[936.39s -> 941.59s]  little bit of extra getting used to it because I did the tutorial with type A. So it might take
[941.59s -> 945.03s]  me like a little bit to get used to it, but it's probably better. Like you said, in the long run,
[945.75s -> 959.27s]  we have a face game. We've been good. No, no, not yet. What is sprint or run? I could lock on his
[959.27s -> 968.34s]  Elvon cycle. Icons is triangle. R2 is magic on this one. Square is ready. Iconic ability.
[973.91s -> 987.86s]  No face game. You have to wait. I'm waiting for your birthday. Your birthday is in like 20 minutes.
[991.67s -> 1005.78s]  Your birthday is in 20 minutes. Okay. What's your iconic ability? Being able to go like this.
[1010.22s -> 1014.76s]  For a long time and hold the note. Titan has knocked the fight out of our iron blood and
[1014.76s -> 1029.05s]  the rest of them can't be the main host. Wait. Our fortunes have turned sergeant. It's her,
[1029.05s -> 1035.21s]  the dominant. Are you certain the crystalline orthodox is a backwards faith for a backwards
[1035.21s -> 1041.53s]  people in the iron kingdom? They teach the dominance are unclean aberrations born of
[1041.53s -> 1046.01s]  blackest sin. Only their priests are allowed to perform the rights of priming.
[1046.89s -> 1050.49s]  And I see many. Change it live to Wyvern if you want in the title.
[1055.78s -> 1061.91s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's go.
[1073.43s -> 1090.62s]  Holy shit. Nobody messes with the bastards.
[1113.93s -> 1119.50s]  Okay. Hey, what? Wait, what?
[1125.98s -> 1139.45s]  Understood. Should have done a lower check. I got to get the controls down. So there's like a
[1139.45s -> 1149.05s]  parry. There's a parry. There's a, okay. That's the magic. Magic is if I want to do the,
[1150.33s -> 1157.30s]  sorry, I am, I am hyping up right now. Okay. So that's if you want to do the combo
[1165.69s -> 1172.41s]  and then holding instead of it's where and then what is it? What button is that? Is it up?
[1172.41s -> 1182.18s]  What button is that? Okay. That's our two. That's our one. All right. How do I do this
[1182.18s -> 1190.60s]  phoenix shift when it comes to the new control scheme? Lock on. What? Oh, okay. L2 is phoenix
[1190.60s -> 1203.67s]  shift. All right. Got it. Oh, shit. What does that say? Shit. Shit. What does that say?
[1212.58s -> 1226.06s]  What? Why did that happen? They're having an auto update. Whatever. I'm going to get like
[1226.06s -> 1231.80s]  ticks from mom up there apparently. All right. I gotta, I gotta learn, I gotta learn to get my
[1231.80s -> 1242.31s]  controls back. I got a whole new control scheme. All right. You know what? You know, you know what?
[1242.31s -> 1251.29s]  I think I'm going back. I think I'm going back. I got used to it. I'm going back. Yeah, I'm going
[1251.29s -> 1259.59s]  back. I know. I know. One's like, no, no, no, no, but I got used to it in the demo and I got to use
[1259.59s -> 1320.73s]  it. Yep. She's not even fully primed. Shit. All right. It's square and triangle, square and
[1320.73s -> 1325.10s]  triangle. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. It's just a good warmup. It's a good warmup.
[1345.02s -> 1376.71s]  Do I have enough heals? Yeah, I'm good. Oh shit. All right. We're good. Okay. I went to type A,
[1376.71s -> 1380.47s]  then I went to type B and I went back and I went forward. I got it. I got it. I figured it out
[1380.47s -> 1394.70s]  quick. Can you dodge roll? It is a dodge. Okay. Frozen tier crafting. Very nice. I probably
[1394.70s -> 1414.49s]  shouldn't lower check. Moves are cool. They are. I want to look at the upgrade tree. Is she dead?
[1415.13s -> 1428.87s]  I don't think so. Well, what are you waiting for? Oh, we, okay. We don't need to lower check. I know.
[1429.35s -> 1472.60s]  What are you here? Bloody do it then. What the? Jesus. Company Wyvern. You've dodged that? Yeah,
[1473.46s -> 1481.90s]  a hundred percent. What the hell are you doing? Get your ass over here and help me with these
[1481.90s -> 1506.70s]  bastards. We're the bastards. Which ones do you mean? Sorry Jill. All right. Let's go. What is
[1506.70s -> 1522.02s]  wrong with you Wyvern? Dominant. I know her. All right. It's L1 is lock on. Yep. There we go.
[1522.02s -> 1535.32s]  That's what I'm looking for. Is there a better way to kind of flick between? Okay. It's bright
[1535.32s -> 1556.36s]  stick. Let me get the dodge down again. That was my kill. That's done. Won't ask you again, Wyvern.
[1557.32s -> 1571.11s]  Take her head so we can be done with this. I can't. I won't. We have to fight? Betray the holy empire?
[1571.83s -> 1578.07s]  Betray? I don't recall ever pledging allegiance to your emperor. My service may have been bought
[1578.07s -> 1587.62s]  with this brand, but not my loyalty. I just fight to survive. Really? We have to fight you?
[1588.58s -> 1592.26s]  Are you dead? Wait, what is going on?
[1600.23s -> 1602.39s]  All right. I gotta, I gotta, I gotta play now. I gotta play.
[1616.04s -> 1643.06s]  You're not going to hit me. You'll never hit me. Top it off.
[1643.06s -> 1644.82s]  Did you think you'd get tired of just wearing it that many times?
[1661.62s -> 1666.42s]  I've always had a name. And I've not forgotten it. It's Clive.
[1671.10s -> 1679.93s]  Oh. Oh.
[1679.93s -> 1723.59s]  Oh, this is fucking fun.
[1746.50s -> 1749.62s]  Cool. All right. See, I got it. Need to take a vinegar. So
[1751.10s -> 1759.46s]  level up. Nice. All right. You've been good. You've been good. I'll turn it on.
[1759.46s -> 1769.22s]  You've been good. Although I didn't do this. Ooh, the whole crafting system.
[1769.22s -> 1770.58s]  Actually, let me, let me turn this off for a sec.
[1771.88s -> 1789.58s]  Got seen. Your mom did a nice job with your hair today. Okay. Okay, dude.
[1819.83s -> 1854.06s]  Damn. Constant conflict. And dog.
[1884.95s -> 1890.30s]  We need to lower check. We actually kind of do. All right. This is great because we actually
[1890.30s -> 1896.23s]  really need this. Uh, let me, let me, I need to do something very quickly. Give me one second.
[1896.23s -> 1905.66s]  I need to. Okay. That's actually all right. Oh, there we go. So make sure that looks all right.
[1906.22s -> 1916.18s]  I need to make sure my webcam is delayed a little because it will not be synced up with the game.
[1918.04s -> 1924.09s]  Now it should be. Hi. Hi there. Uh, where's a good place for the camera? Like up here.
[1924.09s -> 1931.22s]  I'll just gonna be tiny camera. And by the way, it's going off unless you're good.
[1937.61s -> 1944.89s]  All right. So we got, let's see. Right. Dominant Shiva and Clive's childhood friend
[1944.89s -> 1950.65s]  in the depths of the Nysa Defile. The two came to blows at the orders of the armies that enslaved
[1950.65s -> 1964.26s]  them. That should be good. Too much. Delay is too much. Really? Shouldn't be. Should match up pretty
[1964.26s -> 1977.78s]  well. That's not, that's bad. It's really badly desynced. Wait, what? Really shouldn't be. It's
[1977.78s -> 1994.68s]  not even close. How about now? If I go like this. How about now? No? It's by like 500 milliseconds.
[1994.68s -> 2010.15s]  Well, the face cam's going off. All right. Okay. I remember this. Holy empire. Tiamat is the leader
[2010.15s -> 2021.99s]  of the elite assassin squadron to which Wyvern is assigned. The bastards. I'll figure it out at the
[2021.99s -> 2026.57s]  break. Or in like 10 minutes. I don't know. Just, just, just hang out. Just chill. I'll fix it.
[2029.14s -> 2035.88s]  Okay. And this is Branded Soldier. Bears forced to fight for the nations that enslaved them.
[2035.88s -> 2040.28s]  Able to cast powerful magics yet entirely disposable. They're often placed on the front
[2040.28s -> 2049.54s]  lines in battle or assigned to highly dangerous scouting or assassination missions. All right.
[2080.47s -> 2095.64s]  You put the ice queen on her back. No doubt. But you'll have to work harder if you're to claim
[2095.64s -> 2113.62s]  this price. My lady, the thunder. We'll be hearing more soon enough. Always worth
[2113.62s -> 2125.05s]  fucking snakes it. Gather the men. We have work to do. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. All right.
[2125.93s -> 2133.35s]  Yeah. Cause I have to delay my microphone by 800 milliseconds to go with the capture of the
[2133.35s -> 2139.91s]  PlayStation 5. So I have to delay my webcam by 800 milliseconds, but apparently that's not matching
[2139.91s -> 2161.00s]  up. Why is your setup so bad? It's, it's fine. And who's this fine hound I see before me?
[2161.00s -> 2177.48s]  A fine hound who saved your life. That's who? Toggle. Hi. His name is Toggle. You two acquainted?
[2178.71s -> 2187.88s]  Well then, you won't mind taking him off my hands. Funny. I'd always pictured you as more
[2187.88s -> 2200.33s]  the chocobo type. Clive Rosfield. Can you do this voice? No. Come now. Fleetus flame,
[2200.41s -> 2205.11s]  fierce as a wildfire. That there was the blessing of the phoenix.
[2205.11s -> 2211.22s]  I'd heard rumors that you'd survived, but I never paid them much heed.
[2213.27s -> 2219.22s]  You could definitely do it with filters. And if I drop my pitch down. Calm down. I didn't
[2219.22s -> 2225.13s]  come all this way for your handsome mug. Now her on the other hand, she seemed worth muddying my
[2225.13s -> 2243.26s]  boots for. None the worse for her. Still might be best to get a second opinion. Crack her up.
[2244.26s -> 2258.39s]  Who's that? Not another step. I mean it. Well, I'm not about to leave her here.
[2258.39s -> 2269.19s]  Not one with a warm bed waiting. It's all right. You're welcome to join us.
[2270.17s -> 2275.86s]  You do want to help her, don't you? Lord Shack, we know who these people are.
[2275.86s -> 2287.19s]  Sid, if we aren't back soon, Nana will have our heads. I'll explain everything once we're back
[2287.19s -> 2296.81s]  at the hideaway. Come on. We'll get some more introductions.
[2296.81s -> 2312.74s]  You should lore check your microphone and see if the delay can get fixed.
[2321.37s -> 2343.35s]  Okay, cool. The hideaway. Don't worry. I will lore check a million more times.
[2343.35s -> 2354.34s]  How much further now? But we're in the middle of it.
[2355.35s -> 2363.22s]  Keen eye. The blights suck this place dry. Meaning no trees, no birds, and no magic.
[2364.18s -> 2370.39s]  But it also means no neighbors. The last place anyone would think to look.
[2377.40s -> 2388.71s]  That was weird. What just happened in the corner? Are we good? One, two, three, four.
[2394.81s -> 2400.10s]  What are you hearing first? Do you hear me and then my movements or do you see movements then
[2400.10s -> 2408.49s]  hear me? It's very important. Your audio is coming in a second or two before I move.
[2409.13s -> 2431.16s]  Okay, then let's fix it. This place. These are fallen ruins.
[2431.16s -> 2435.80s]  Is this better? Two, one, two. And it keeps the black from our lungs.
[2435.80s -> 2444.38s]  But how do you survive without magic? How does anyone? You must be starving.
[2445.10s -> 2447.50s]  We grow them here. Believe it or not.
[2449.11s -> 2453.53s]  Suit yourself. You're back.
[2455.29s -> 2459.13s]  It's a little bit of a big bite of an apple. This is the dominant.
[2459.85s -> 2464.01s]  How cold since we found her? I was hoping you might give her a look over.
[2465.22s -> 2468.58s]  All right. Good. Get her upstairs.
[2471.30s -> 2474.90s]  Don't fret about Karen. I've taken care of her fee.
[2474.90s -> 2478.42s]  All of it. She's the best healer this side of the belt.
[2479.46s -> 2484.47s]  You have nothing to worry about. Have a look around.
[2484.47s -> 2486.71s]  So do you ever think about getting into voice work?
[2487.67s -> 2490.79s]  You should probably say, do you ever think about reading some of the plays that we have
[2491.59s -> 2497.14s]  in front of an audience? Hide, hide away.
[2499.77s -> 2502.41s]  All right. So we get a map. Detail map of your current area.
[2502.41s -> 2507.54s]  Main scenario destinations are marked with that. That's a map. Cool.
[2507.54s -> 2511.43s]  Oh, and I know exactly. Is it? I know exactly where I need to go.
[2511.99s -> 2517.98s]  Oh, I can just mark it too. How are we doing? We all right?
[2517.98s -> 2529.66s]  One, two, three. Better. Perfect. Yeah. All right.
[2529.66s -> 2535.35s]  And he's a soldier then. Be surprised if he wasn't.
[2535.35s -> 2548.20s]  I'd have some around here. Blacksmith?
[2565.66s -> 2569.10s]  That is not perfect. I'll get it better.
[2570.52s -> 2574.60s]  Is it still are you hearing it still or is it are you hearing me first and then
[2575.32s -> 2577.80s]  my face moving or is it how is it? How bad is it?
[2578.84s -> 2589.64s]  It's fine. It's fine. Just working on a pet project of mine.
[2590.81s -> 2599.51s]  She's not about biting the hand that feeds you. All right.
[2600.07s -> 2603.91s]  I was hoping we might try and solve the mystery of poor Clive Rusfield,
[2604.47s -> 2609.56s]  a bearer of the San Brecois Imperial Army sent behind enemy lines
[2610.60s -> 2615.96s]  with orders to wait until it turned into a brawl, then slip the dominant throat in the chaos.
[2617.40s -> 2621.64s]  I didn't know it was her. How could it be?
[2622.36s -> 2626.73s]  And so to save her neck, you slit your sergeants,
[2626.73s -> 2632.49s]  then set your sights on the hills, conveniently forgetting how the Empire deals with deserters.
[2633.29s -> 2637.37s]  Because with that on your chop, my friend, we both know you won't be getting far.
[2639.67s -> 2642.71s]  Without you, I mean, you're going to help me, though. Of course.
[2645.82s -> 2651.19s]  You've fallen a long way, Rusfield. You look like a pickle today.
[2651.91s -> 2670.52s]  It's fine. A lot of it said that I'm a poor host.
[2671.08s -> 2674.62s]  What do you mean to do with her? Do with her?
[2675.58s -> 2682.86s]  Why nothing? Her life is her own now. If I wanted to use her, do you think I'd be talking to you?
[2683.96s -> 2688.97s]  All I want to do is help. Dominance like her. Branded like you.
[2689.77s -> 2693.85s]  Of course, the realm doesn't approve, which is why we live in a cave.
[2694.57s -> 2700.60s]  I want candles like that. And it's also why we need help
[2701.24s -> 2704.10s]  from Branded who know one end of a sword from the other.
[2707.05s -> 2710.18s]  What say you, Clive? Will you join us?
[2723.11s -> 2728.10s]  Sid, was it? I trust that you'll do right by Joe.
[2728.82s -> 2735.13s]  But until my brother is avenged, I must walk my own path.
[2735.93s -> 2738.65s]  Avenged?
[2740.41s -> 2746.18s]  Are you typing? I'm I'm watching. I'm just I'm asking a quick question.
[2746.18s -> 2752.38s]  The phoenix's evil swing. Another room I've proven true.
[2753.46s -> 2756.50s]  I only stand here today because of Joshua.
[2757.46s -> 2761.62s]  13 years I've waited for this chance. I've slept in filth.
[2762.26s -> 2765.22s]  Junk from a gutter. Killed more men than I can count.
[2767.08s -> 2771.30s]  You're right. The Empire will not suffer a deserter.
[2772.65s -> 2777.66s]  This will be my best opportunity. My last.
[2778.30s -> 2781.82s]  Which is why you should join us.
[2783.10s -> 2784.54s]  I told you I'm not-
[2784.54s -> 2785.74s]  Interested, I know.
[2790.22s -> 2794.46s]  One of my scouts sent word there's a group of branded fugitives north of here,
[2794.46s -> 2796.22s]  in the Imperial village of Lostwing.
[2797.34s -> 2800.54s]  Among them is one he believes to be a dominance of fire.
[2804.41s -> 2805.13s]  Is he certain?
[2808.54s -> 2809.82s]  What say we go and ask him?
[2814.62s -> 2816.30s]  This doesn't mean I'm joining you.
[2825.93s -> 2826.89s]  Let's make ready then.
[2828.17s -> 2835.18s]  You'll find everything you need down in the main hall, as well as a few things you don't.
[2835.18s -> 2845.05s]  Sid's solar. Visit the main hall.
[2846.47s -> 2847.03s]  On this way.
[2847.59s -> 2849.75s]  I wonder, should I like, buy anything?
[2851.59s -> 2853.11s]  How much money do I even have?
[2853.11s -> 2865.48s]  Your hair looks red.
[2879.99s -> 2881.59s]  This is the full game. Full game came out today.
[2883.19s -> 2884.71s]  We picked up at the end of the demo.
[2888.34s -> 2889.14s]  On PS5.
[2891.69s -> 2892.95s]  To the forge it is then.
[2893.51s -> 2896.82s]  Do we actually get to upgrade stuff?
[2896.82s -> 2899.64s]  Oh wait, no, hold up. You'll be needing this.
[2901.00s -> 2903.24s]  Blackthorn won't take no notice of you otherwise.
[2904.12s -> 2905.43s]  Might not anyway.
[2906.23s -> 2910.47s]  Somebody said it looks like your room is upside down?
[2911.27s -> 2912.31s]  What are you talking about?
[2921.64s -> 2923.00s]  My room is not upside down?
[2925.11s -> 2927.03s]  Why would I even need to address that?
[2927.75s -> 2929.75s]  Of course I'm not, I'm sitting here.
[2929.75s -> 2933.99s]  I'm not here to talk.
[2934.55s -> 2935.75s]  I'll be accompanying you.
[2935.75s -> 2939.51s]  Imagine defending that no, I am not in fact upside down.
[2941.03s -> 2942.39s]  How do you even argue that?
[2942.39s -> 2943.35s]  For all I care.
[2943.35s -> 2946.42s]  Or lifting a finger for you.
[2946.42s -> 2947.14s]  Is that so?
[2948.02s -> 2951.35s]  Okay.
[2951.35s -> 2958.17s]  Some spirit, better suited to stripping oil from a painter's canvas than consumption,
[2958.17s -> 2962.65s]  grants overworked conscripts a few rare moments of sweet oblivion
[2962.65s -> 2966.73s]  on their long arduous sea journeys north from the continent.
[2966.73s -> 2969.37s]  Okay, here, take this.
[2971.16s -> 2972.36s]  Do you want that or not?
[2973.80s -> 2974.76s]  I can take it back.
[2977.78s -> 2981.08s]  Damn you, Goots.
[2981.08s -> 2982.12s]  All right, all right.
[2982.12s -> 2983.90s]  No need to be hasty.
[2985.67s -> 2986.63s]  Let's have a look at you.
[2992.78s -> 2993.42s]  Drop something?
[2996.30s -> 2998.46s]  Everybody just seriously thinks that I'm upside down.
[2998.46s -> 2999.42s]  I'm going to let this go.
[3002.98s -> 3006.26s]  I'll do what I can as a favor to Goot's mind.
[3012.89s -> 3014.17s]  We could barely see that.
[3014.73s -> 3017.21s]  It's hard when you're in a little cube over here.
[3017.85s -> 3020.01s]  There, I have to match it up that way.
[3020.01s -> 3020.73s]  Okay.
[3020.73s -> 3024.86s]  The crafting of new gear as well as the upgrading of existing gear
[3024.86s -> 3028.10s]  can be done at a blacksmith.
[3028.10s -> 3031.32s]  As long as you have the recipe and the proper materials.
[3031.32s -> 3035.00s]  Select a highlighted item from the list and hold X to craft or upgrade.
[3035.00s -> 3039.34s]  Looks like I can upgrade my iron belt.
[3039.34s -> 3047.90s]  Okay.
[3047.90s -> 3049.58s]  Okay.
[3049.58s -> 3050.86s]  Fine, I'll stop vibing.
[3050.86s -> 3052.14s]  I'll stop vibing then.
[3052.14s -> 3052.46s]  Fine.
[3053.02s -> 3055.58s]  Okay.
[3055.58s -> 3058.68s]  Iron belt.
[3058.68s -> 3059.32s]  I can also read.
[3059.32s -> 3059.96s]  There's nothing to read for.
[3059.96s -> 3060.52s]  Sorry, I could do...
[3061.16s -> 3062.60s]  Okay.
[3062.60s -> 3063.16s]  Let's see.
[3063.16s -> 3064.04s]  It wants me to do it.
[3064.68s -> 3069.54s]  And the belt sees a square.
[3069.54s -> 3073.11s]  You want anything else, you bring your own materials.
[3073.75s -> 3074.79s]  I'll bear that in mind.
[3076.20s -> 3076.68s]  Thank you.
[3079.88s -> 3080.92s]  A word of advice.
[3081.56s -> 3083.40s]  Don't let Sid decide what's best for you.
[3088.36s -> 3090.84s]  Notices when something has changed in the hideaway,
[3090.84s -> 3093.48s]  a notice will appear in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.
[3094.12s -> 3098.50s]  In addition to stock updates for Charon's Toll
[3098.50s -> 3101.22s]  and new forging recipes for the Black Hammer,
[3101.22s -> 3102.74s]  there are also notices for new quests,
[3102.74s -> 3104.98s]  new missions, and many other things.
[3105.54s -> 3107.94s]  A icon will appear in-game
[3107.94s -> 3109.86s]  as well as on the local map to indicate recent updates.
[3109.86s -> 3110.98s]  Sorry, it's a little like side thing.
[3110.98s -> 3111.86s]  I suppose I should think it...
[3111.86s -> 3112.26s]  Updates.
[3114.58s -> 3116.50s]  A new crafting recipe is available at the...
[3116.50s -> 3117.22s]  Okay.
[3117.22s -> 3117.94s]  Let's just see what it is.
[3118.74s -> 3119.70s]  I see I'm busy here.
[3120.58s -> 3122.30s]  I'm a Sanfordian, dear.
[3125.40s -> 3127.59s]  Broad sword.
[3127.59s -> 3130.15s]  I need three Y-rite.
[3130.15s -> 3133.75s]  I could do iron bracers.
[3134.31s -> 3141.43s]  What do I have right now?
[3141.99s -> 3143.51s]  I'm wearing the broadsword right now.
[3143.51s -> 3145.26s]  Broad sword plus one.
[3145.90s -> 3147.38s]  No, I actually don't.
[3147.38s -> 3148.18s]  What do I have right now?
[3148.98s -> 3150.50s]  Why did I do this with my voice?
[3150.50s -> 3151.96s]  All right.
[3151.96s -> 3152.44s]  I can...
[3152.44s -> 3154.44s]  Should I make some bracers?
[3154.44s -> 3166.92s]  I could.
[3166.92s -> 3167.40s]  Why not?
[3167.40s -> 3167.88s]  Say...
[3167.88s -> 3168.12s]  Yeah.
[3168.12s -> 3168.28s]  Wait.
[3168.28s -> 3169.32s]  Oh, this uses a Y-rite.
[3169.32s -> 3169.96s]  I'll save for the sword.
[3171.83s -> 3172.71s]  I want damage.
[3173.35s -> 3176.38s]  All right.
[3176.38s -> 3178.62s]  So what else is unlocked here?
[3178.62s -> 3179.98s]  The fat chocobo.
[3179.98s -> 3181.50s]  Well, I'm going to see that.
[3181.50s -> 3186.84s]  There's no way I'm not going to go investigate that.
[3193.62s -> 3193.86s]  All right.
[3193.86s -> 3195.06s]  Where's this fat chocobo?
[3195.06s -> 3196.58s]  Oh, that's the name of the restaurant.
[3197.14s -> 3207.24s]  I thought there was going to be like a big chocobo in here.
[3207.88s -> 3211.08s]  Can I eat something?
[3218.84s -> 3219.72s]  Auto.
[3223.10s -> 3223.34s]  All right.
[3223.34s -> 3223.90s]  Well, let's just go.
[3226.01s -> 3236.65s]  The gift worked.
[3237.69s -> 3238.57s]  You have my thanks.
[3238.57s -> 3241.29s]  Your face game doesn't line up with the header in the game,
[3241.29s -> 3242.89s]  and it's torturing me.
[3242.89s -> 3243.77s]  Come on.
[3243.77s -> 3244.41s]  Nearly there.
[3264.06s -> 3264.70s]  You.
[3264.70s -> 3265.34s]  Blankets.
[3265.34s -> 3266.06s]  Quick as you like.
[3278.31s -> 3279.27s]  All right.
[3279.27s -> 3281.51s]  We're making comfortable while a bed's made up.
[3281.51s -> 3282.79s]  Can you guys test the command?
[3282.79s -> 3284.71s]  Can you guys do exclamation FF16?
[3284.71s -> 3285.83s]  I'm just going to stand there.
[3285.83s -> 3287.03s]  Someone face some water.
[3287.59s -> 3288.71s]  I'll get the bucket.
[3289.59s -> 3291.51s]  You can't see if what I need's out.
[3292.79s -> 3294.71s]  Oh, wait, me.
[3296.14s -> 3300.09s]  Well, not all of you at the same time, but it could be working.
[3300.95s -> 3301.51s]  Is it working?
[3302.07s -> 3304.94s]  What the hell have I got myself into?
[3319.80s -> 3321.56s]  Nurseries in 864 P.
[3321.56s -> 3322.12s]  Who are they?
[3322.84s -> 3324.34s]  It's got a 30 second cooldown.
[3325.94s -> 3328.02s]  They're freed imperial bearers.
[3328.02s -> 3328.82s]  Who the hell are you?
[3332.63s -> 3334.87s]  Shit, at this rate, you won't make it through the night.
[3335.59s -> 3338.55s]  Then you can find your way up them stairs to the infirmary.
[3338.55s -> 3339.43s]  We need Taya.
[3340.07s -> 3340.71s]  Well, go on.
[3341.43s -> 3342.23s]  Shift your arse.
[3343.11s -> 3348.60s]  Let's tell you the one looking after Jill.
[3349.72s -> 3350.04s]  All right.
[3350.04s -> 3352.28s]  Speak with Taya in the infirmary.
[3352.28s -> 3357.38s]  What's all the commotion?
[3357.38s -> 3358.58s]  I think we should go and help.
[3358.58s -> 3361.78s]  It sounds like we've got some new customers.
[3361.78s -> 3362.26s]  Auto.
[3364.38s -> 3366.70s]  R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.
[3374.28s -> 3375.80s]  Your friend needs her rest.
[3376.52s -> 3379.88s]  There'll be time for tearful reunions once she's recovered.
[3380.52s -> 3381.40s]  I'm not here for Jill.
[3381.96s -> 3383.48s]  You're wanted downstairs.
[3383.48s -> 3385.08s]  There are injured bearers in need of attention.
[3385.80s -> 3387.16s]  Well, why didn't you say so?
[3388.86s -> 3391.02s]  Can you explain the lore of the last 16 games?
[3391.02s -> 3393.91s]  Well, that's the beauty of Final Fantasy.
[3393.91s -> 3395.27s]  You don't need to know anything
[3395.27s -> 3396.63s]  about the other Final Fantasy games.
[3396.63s -> 3398.95s]  You could start at Final Fantasy 16
[3398.95s -> 3402.68s]  and you are golden with its own story.
[3402.68s -> 3404.54s]  You don't need to know anything
[3404.54s -> 3405.90s]  about any of the Final Fantasies.
[3405.90s -> 3407.26s]  It's a perfect place to start.
[3412.02s -> 3413.38s]  He's going to be all right.
[3413.38s -> 3413.78s]  Thank you.
[3413.78s -> 3415.94s]  But I'll need to examine them both in the infirmary.
[3418.86s -> 3420.06s]  Yeah, but nobody said that.
[3420.06s -> 3420.54s]  Yeah, they did.
[3420.54s -> 3421.26s]  They just asked it.
[3439.10s -> 3441.02s]  Another fond day of the Heideweide.
[3441.02s -> 3444.23s]  To many of the bearers who come here arrive in this state.
[3444.95s -> 3446.31s]  It's no easy thing.
[3446.31s -> 3447.43s]  Cast me off your chains.
[3448.71s -> 3450.39s]  By the time most pluck up the courage,
[3450.95s -> 3451.99s]  they're all too far gone.
[3451.99s -> 3453.19s]  Can we get a lore check?
[3453.91s -> 3455.35s]  These two here are the lucky ones.
[3467.35s -> 3472.82s]  Sedolphus Telemann, cornered by a battalion of iron kingdom crusaders
[3472.82s -> 3478.02s]  in the depths of the Nysa Defile, Clive thought his end was nigh,
[3478.02s -> 3480.82s]  until Cid appeared and spirited him and Jill away
[3480.82s -> 3482.50s]  to his secret hideaway in the Deadlands.
[3484.01s -> 3485.29s]  Pretty fucking sick.
[3485.93s -> 3488.15s]  The name's Otto.
[3488.79s -> 3489.59s]  You need anything?
[3490.23s -> 3490.87s]  You asked me.
[3491.59s -> 3494.15s]  Well, Otto, I do need some supplies.
[3494.95s -> 3495.67s]  Do you now?
[3496.79s -> 3500.31s]  Then Lady Karen over there will be more than happy to help.
[3500.31s -> 3501.19s]  Can buy some stuff.
[3501.83s -> 3502.15s]  Right.
[3504.31s -> 3506.62s]  Oh, and thanks.
[3507.51s -> 3508.23s]  Be seeing you.
[3508.87s -> 3509.51s]  Not likely.
[3510.39s -> 3511.19s]  I won't be staying.
[3511.91s -> 3512.55s]  Is that right?
[3513.94s -> 3515.54s]  Well, for as long as you are.
[3515.54s -> 3517.62s]  This guy does not sound like Otto.
[3518.58s -> 3519.62s]  You helped us today.
[3520.58s -> 3521.62s]  And we won't forget it.
[3522.34s -> 3524.42s]  You have to stay and we won't forget it.
[3524.42s -> 3524.82s]  Thank you.
[3525.80s -> 3528.12s]  It's a pleasure to do business with you.
[3528.12s -> 3528.92s]  My name's Otto.
[3530.18s -> 3531.06s]  Yeah, you're right.
[3531.06s -> 3532.18s]  Doesn't sound the same.
[3534.06s -> 3536.95s]  Side quests have been unlocked.
[3536.95s -> 3539.75s]  So green icons are side quests.
[3543.83s -> 3547.43s]  After accepting quest, quest objectives appear in the to-do list.
[3547.43s -> 3547.85s]  Okay.
[3548.97s -> 3553.13s]  Red is a main scenario and then you can have up to three green side quests.
[3554.10s -> 3555.70s]  Any quest can be prioritized.
[3556.98s -> 3557.62s]  Right.
[3557.62s -> 3561.06s]  Okay.
[3563.16s -> 3564.84s]  The Thousand Tomes.
[3564.84s -> 3566.12s]  An ever-growing compendium.
[3566.12s -> 3567.56s]  All things Velystia.
[3568.44s -> 3570.12s]  The Orchestrion.
[3570.12s -> 3572.04s]  Jukebox for all the songs collected through the game.
[3572.04s -> 3572.28s]  Cool.
[3573.40s -> 3574.76s]  They're in the Fat Chocobo.
[3574.76s -> 3575.96s]  Who are these people?
[3575.96s -> 3576.60s]  Oh, all right.
[3577.40s -> 3581.91s]  Does anybody want the little M&M crunchies in my ice cream?
[3581.91s -> 3583.11s]  I kind of just want the ice cream.
[3587.02s -> 3588.78s]  You don't want the M&M's in the ice cream?
[3588.78s -> 3589.58s]  What do you mean?
[3589.58s -> 3590.86s]  You eat around the M&M's?
[3591.88s -> 3592.20s]  That's...
[3592.92s -> 3593.24s]  Really?
[3593.80s -> 3595.30s]  It's like the best part.
[3596.02s -> 3599.85s]  I need supplies for my journey to Lostwing.
[3600.49s -> 3601.43s]  I'm talking...
[3601.43s -> 3602.23s]  What else can you provide them?
[3602.87s -> 3603.51s]  What's that?
[3604.55s -> 3607.27s]  Does the newcomer think it proper to make demands
[3607.27s -> 3610.87s]  of a poor old matron before even introducing himself?
[3612.63s -> 3613.51s]  It's Clive.
[3613.51s -> 3614.39s]  M&M's are gross?
[3614.39s -> 3615.83s]  No, Clive.
[3615.83s -> 3617.35s]  M&M's are gross by themselves.
[3617.35s -> 3617.91s]  I hear that dog is yours.
[3617.91s -> 3620.31s]  They're amazing in other baked goods or ice creams.
[3620.31s -> 3622.55s]  Since he found Sidon one night, I've seen to it that his
[3622.55s -> 3624.39s]  chin's rubbed and his belly fed.
[3625.11s -> 3626.95s]  Though I suppose that's your job now.
[3628.22s -> 3629.90s]  Unless you lose him again.
[3629.90s -> 3630.78s]  M&M's and cookies?
[3630.78s -> 3631.10s]  I won't.
[3631.10s -> 3631.82s]  S tier.
[3631.82s -> 3633.26s]  M&M's and ice cream?
[3633.26s -> 3633.34s]  Not again.
[3633.34s -> 3634.22s]  S tier.
[3634.22s -> 3635.10s]  Handful of M&M's?
[3635.10s -> 3636.38s]  Thank you for watching him.
[3636.38s -> 3636.88s]  C.
[3636.88s -> 3639.50s]  So, were you gonna buy something?
[3640.06s -> 3640.94s]  C plus maybe.
[3641.58s -> 3644.78s]  You didn't think I'd shower your lordship with my hard-won wares
[3644.78s -> 3647.34s]  while you swagger about with a pocketful of gil?
[3648.30s -> 3650.30s]  Life doesn't work that way, lad.
[3651.10s -> 3653.91s]  Now, let's see some coin.
[3656.49s -> 3657.37s]  All right.
[3660.57s -> 3662.57s]  Shop stock changes as the story progresses,
[3662.57s -> 3663.69s]  so be sure to check frequently.
[3664.70s -> 3665.98s]  So, I can buy a broad-
[3665.98s -> 3667.66s]  Wait, I can buy a broadsword?
[3667.66s -> 3668.70s]  I'm gonna buy a broadsword,
[3668.70s -> 3670.62s]  then I'm gonna take it over and upgrade the broadsword.
[3670.62s -> 3674.81s]  How many I f-
[3674.81s -> 3675.13s]  Four.
[3675.13s -> 3675.85s]  I'll get another one of these.
[3676.73s -> 3677.45s]  Wait, how much-
[3677.45s -> 3678.33s]  That's 200!
[3679.05s -> 3682.81s]  It's 500 bucks for the broadsword,
[3682.81s -> 3684.97s]  and it's 200 for potion?
[3685.53s -> 3689.70s]  Seems like a lot.
[3689.70s -> 3690.02s]  All right.
[3690.74s -> 3691.70s]  I'm getting the broadsword.
[3696.06s -> 3697.02s]  Yeah, I'm gonna-
[3697.02s -> 3697.82s]  I'm gonna go upgrade it.
[3699.34s -> 3701.02s]  You're robbing me blind, you know.
[3701.66s -> 3704.09s]  Just don't get hit.
[3704.09s -> 3704.57s]  I'll be fine.
[3705.21s -> 3706.71s]  That's all.
[3706.71s -> 3710.25s]  Why, you're barely a girl to your name.
[3710.25s -> 3710.89s]  Just don't get hit.
[3711.53s -> 3716.46s]  You're taking his side now.
[3717.74s -> 3719.90s]  And after all I've done for you.
[3722.14s -> 3722.86s]  All right.
[3724.25s -> 3724.97s]  All right.
[3724.97s -> 3726.49s]  I can make an exception.
[3729.03s -> 3730.79s]  But just this once, mind.
[3731.43s -> 3732.87s]  Me stores are getting cluttered,
[3732.87s -> 3734.87s]  and I need to make room for the next shipment.
[3737.45s -> 3737.93s]  You're-
[3737.93s -> 3738.73s]  You're broke now?
[3738.73s -> 3741.21s]  Thank you.
[3741.21s -> 3741.85s]  Thank me?
[3743.77s -> 3744.73s]  Thank your dog.
[3745.37s -> 3749.48s]  Wha- wha- wha- wha- wha- wha- wha- wha- wha- wha-
[3749.48s -> 3750.60s]  What button do I press to get off?
[3750.60s -> 3751.08s]  Camera.
[3751.08s -> 3751.40s]  That one.
[3766.25s -> 3766.57s]  All right.
[3766.57s -> 3767.61s]  Collect the supplies.
[3767.61s -> 3769.77s]  Wait, did I just buy a broadsword for no reason?
[3772.49s -> 3774.73s]  I swear to God there's a broadsword in one of these sacks.
[3774.73s -> 3775.53s]  I'm gonna be pissed off.
[3785.02s -> 3787.34s]  Virtual Battlescape provides Clive a safe location
[3787.34s -> 3788.70s]  to test out new abilities
[3788.70s -> 3790.54s]  and train against all manner of enemies.
[3792.12s -> 3794.20s]  Oh, it's like a little training zone.
[3794.20s -> 3795.00s]  All of virtue.
[3797.24s -> 3797.72s]  That's cool.
[3798.66s -> 3799.62s]  I guess it wants me to do it.
[3800.94s -> 3801.66s]  Do I?
[3801.66s -> 3802.94s]  Yeah, I guess it's like go do it.
[3809.86s -> 3810.74s]  I'm telling you, I'm gonna-
[3810.74s -> 3811.30s]  I'm gonna be-
[3811.30s -> 3814.02s]  I'm gonna be the guy that has the big bump on the-
[3814.02s -> 3815.06s]  on like the- the uh-
[3815.78s -> 3817.54s]  the official source of this music.
[3818.84s -> 3820.68s]  I- I'll be the bump on YouTube, you know what I mean?
[3821.24s -> 3830.71s]  Okay.
[3830.71s -> 3831.35s]  Ooh!
[3831.35s -> 3832.71s]  Wait, you can see what I do over here!
[3832.71s -> 3833.51s]  That's kind of- I don't like-
[3834.07s -> 3834.63s]  That's weird.
[3834.63s -> 3836.23s]  You guys are gonna try to judge my movements.
[3841.00s -> 3842.12s]  The YouTube video hump.
[3842.12s -> 3843.48s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[3843.48s -> 3846.46s]  The thing that says the most replayed part of the video.
[3846.46s -> 3847.50s]  I'm gonna contribute to that.
[3847.50s -> 3848.22s]  It's gonna be bad.
[3849.34s -> 3870.58s]  Why does he move so weird?
[3870.58s -> 3871.94s]  I'm just fucking around.
[3874.90s -> 3876.26s]  All right, this is really cool.
[3876.26s -> 3877.94s]  So I can do invincibility.
[3877.94s -> 3879.06s]  I can do an action log.
[3879.06s -> 3882.01s]  I can do enemy invincibility.
[3882.01s -> 3883.53s]  I can probably change the tar-
[3883.53s -> 3884.09s]  Yeah, all right.
[3884.09s -> 3884.65s]  That's cool.
[3887.45s -> 3887.93s]  So I can-
[3888.49s -> 3890.25s]  Oh, you can practice against bosses?
[3890.25s -> 3890.97s]  Is that how that works?
[3905.42s -> 3907.02s]  So not attacking currently.
[3907.66s -> 3913.06s]  Oh, enemy aggro.
[3913.06s -> 3913.54s]  Here we go.
[3915.45s -> 3915.93s]  Interesting.
[3916.65s -> 3923.80s]  It's a good place to practice dodging.
[3925.72s -> 3935.16s]  Ow!
[3936.65s -> 3937.29s]  All right, cool.
[3937.85s -> 3939.85s]  I might practice here with some encounters.
[3940.49s -> 3954.62s]  The person really wants me to know that they ate a bunch of bread.
[3962.87s -> 3964.71s]  Even already, are ya?
[3965.27s -> 3968.95s]  It's you I'll miss the most, Lady Karen.
[3968.95s -> 3970.23s]  It always is.
[3970.23s -> 3971.99s]  Doesn't stop you going, does it?
[3973.98s -> 3974.78s]  This should be fun.
[3979.02s -> 3980.46s]  When's the BLT stream?
[3982.14s -> 3982.64s]  Soon.
[3995.40s -> 3996.44s]  There's fast travel.
[3996.44s -> 3997.40s]  You use the world map.
[3997.40s -> 3999.24s]  Instant travel between unlocked locations.
[4000.78s -> 4003.02s]  New locations are unlocked by progressing through the main story
[4003.02s -> 4008.68s]  or discovering waymarks known as obelisks.
[4008.68s -> 4011.56s]  World map up and automatically upon leaving an area.
[4011.56s -> 4011.88s]  What?
[4011.88s -> 4013.00s]  That was a weird way to say that.
[4014.25s -> 4017.21s]  All right, collect the supplies, which were right here.
[4017.77s -> 4019.50s]  Come on, get us off.
[4020.14s -> 4021.61s]  Clear this.
[4021.61s -> 4025.34s]  There we go.
[4025.34s -> 4026.70s]  Make for the Great Wood.
[4033.13s -> 4034.39s]  Oh, world map.
[4034.39s -> 4034.95s]  There it is.
[4034.95s -> 4035.67s]  Which button is that?
[4038.04s -> 4038.54s]  Ah.
[4042.95s -> 4043.45s]  Okay.
[4044.73s -> 4045.61s]  We're going over here.
[4045.61s -> 4046.41s]  The Great Wood.
[4047.05s -> 4048.57s]  So deep and vast as the Great Wood,
[4048.57s -> 4052.01s]  it serves as a defensive barrier between the Crystal Belt and the Holy Empire.
[4052.97s -> 4055.53s]  Are you gonna finish the game?
[4056.42s -> 4059.62s]  I, streaming-wise, if you guys continue to like it,
[4059.62s -> 4061.62s]  I mean, I'm invested.
[4062.34s -> 4064.17s]  I might finish it on my own time,
[4064.17s -> 4066.97s]  like just kind of hanging out on the couch or maybe I'll play it here.
[4066.97s -> 4067.29s]  I don't know.
[4067.29s -> 4067.61s]  We'll see.
[4067.61s -> 4070.09s]  We'll see how you guys feel because I'm into it.
[4096.60s -> 4104.33s]  When are you gonna do a live audience stream so we can throw tomatoes at you?
[4114.47s -> 4117.67s]  There we go.
[4117.67s -> 4118.79s]  So here's the party.
[4118.79s -> 4119.62s]  Let's go.
[4128.60s -> 4130.81s]  That sound is huge.
[4134.33s -> 4134.83s]  I suppose not.
[4137.48s -> 4137.98s]  Okay.
[4138.68s -> 4139.80s]  Banning embers.
[4143.37s -> 4146.41s]  Torgl has joined the party and will fight alongside Clive.
[4147.61s -> 4154.71s]  So use the d-pad to talk between item shortcuts and pet commands.
[4154.71s -> 4159.64s]  Attack, heal, and launch an enemy into the air.
[4160.82s -> 4161.32s]  Oh.
[4161.70s -> 4164.31s]  So I gotta go boom and then up.
[4165.11s -> 4171.03s]  The accessory known as the Ring of Timely Assistance removes the need for giving Torgl commands.
[4171.03s -> 4171.99s]  When this item is equipped,
[4171.99s -> 4175.75s]  Torgl will attack and heal automatically based on the current battle situation.
[4175.75s -> 4177.59s]  Did I mention there'd be deadly beasts?
[4177.59s -> 4178.63s]  I don't need to put that on.
[4178.63s -> 4179.75s]  There'll be deadly beasts.
[4180.47s -> 4182.15s]  Nothing a trained assassin can't handle.
[4183.03s -> 4183.99s]  How reassuring.
[4185.05s -> 4185.45s]  You're welcome.
[4185.45s -> 4186.41s]  It's very pretty.
[4186.41s -> 4188.09s]  For that and his shortcut.
[4202.55s -> 4203.11s]  Can you walk?
[4204.14s -> 4204.70s]  Walk, walk.
[4205.74s -> 4206.38s]  I'm walking.
[4220.34s -> 4221.06s]  I don't think so.
[4232.42s -> 4233.46s]  I thought he was on the ground.
[4233.46s -> 4234.18s]  I was like, oh shit.
[4234.18s -> 4234.98s]  Sid's like dead.
[4236.10s -> 4246.28s]  Where is Torgl?
[4246.84s -> 4248.14s]  Oh, he's already up there.
[4249.50s -> 4259.32s]  I want to upgrade this.
[4260.04s -> 4263.42s]  I like the magic.
[4264.62s -> 4267.67s]  Is this for sponsorship?
[4267.67s -> 4268.23s]  This is.
[4269.03s -> 4270.34s]  This is sponsored by...
[4270.34s -> 4272.26s]  The stream is sponsored by Square Enix.
[4272.26s -> 4277.16s]  Come on, Thanos 16.
[4277.16s -> 4284.33s]  What do you think of the PS5?
[4287.11s -> 4287.61s]  It's...
[4290.12s -> 4293.88s]  So I use consoles as like a complete multimedia box.
[4295.53s -> 4297.85s]  And PS5 seems pretty great for...
[4297.85s -> 4298.65s]  Hold on a minute.
[4299.85s -> 4300.41s]  Wait a minute.
[4301.05s -> 4301.69s]  He hates it.
[4301.69s -> 4304.25s]  I just thought I'm about to explain to you why I like it so much.
[4304.81s -> 4310.33s]  I didn't even like say two sentences.
[4310.33s -> 4313.37s]  What in good Grieger's name is he doing this far south?
[4315.35s -> 4316.63s]  Looking for food.
[4316.63s -> 4318.31s]  No more wolves where he's from.
[4318.31s -> 4321.35s]  The north was one of the first parts of storm to fall to the blight.
[4322.23s -> 4324.82s]  Oh sod.
[4325.46s -> 4328.26s]  I'd invite him over for a cup of tea if I didn't think he'd eat the dog.
[4336.33s -> 4339.45s]  You said on August 2nd there'd be a bald cam for your birthday.
[4339.45s -> 4342.09s]  I'll just put my head down and you can laugh for five seconds.
[4342.09s -> 4343.77s]  Let's try and stay out of its path.
[4344.41s -> 4345.53s]  Okay, stay away from that.
[4361.98s -> 4379.77s]  Oh, I have the charge move too, don't I?
[4379.77s -> 4380.89s]  This one here.
[4380.89s -> 4384.31s]  Here we go.
[4384.31s -> 4388.55s]  Down.
[4388.55s -> 4393.46s]  Ooh, level up.
[4398.06s -> 4399.02s]  Eleven Gil.
[4399.02s -> 4400.30s]  Is it Gil or Jill?
[4401.02s -> 4401.52s]  Gil?
[4402.14s -> 4411.85s]  Oh, I got...
[4411.85s -> 4412.65s]  Why right?
[4412.65s -> 4414.41s]  Maybe that's enough to upgrade the broadsword.
[4414.41s -> 4415.29s]  Do I even have the broadsword?
[4415.29s -> 4416.09s]  I have it equipped, right?
[4416.09s -> 4416.89s]  Yeah.
[4416.89s -> 4424.76s]  After you.
[4424.76s -> 4425.32s]  It's strong.
[4425.96s -> 4427.08s]  Thank you kindly.
[4435.80s -> 4437.24s]  Like, Gil?
[4437.96s -> 4444.17s]  The ruins.
[4444.81s -> 4452.74s]  They're everywhere, aren't they?
[4452.74s -> 4455.14s]  Some say there was a time they blocked out the stars.
[4456.65s -> 4458.41s]  Down was the only way for them to go.
[4458.41s -> 4459.61s]  Do I not have the broadsword equipped?
[4460.25s -> 4462.33s]  There's probably a lesson to be learned from that.
[4463.13s -> 4464.33s]  But it can wait.
[4464.33s -> 4465.05s]  Come on.
[4465.05s -> 4466.76s]  I'll check.
[4466.76s -> 4468.76s]  Actually, I have points to spend too in the abilities.
[4478.76s -> 4479.72s]  What do I want to focus on?
[4482.04s -> 4483.32s]  Journal tab has information.
[4483.88s -> 4484.36s]  All right.
[4484.36s -> 4485.08s]  What I want to see...
[4486.62s -> 4487.18s]  Items.
[4487.74s -> 4492.70s]  You can assign shortcuts.
[4492.70s -> 4493.20s]  Uh-huh.
[4493.98s -> 4495.66s]  I think the shortcuts are fine.
[4496.38s -> 4497.35s]  What is...
[4497.35s -> 4499.43s]  Wait, I want the strength one, I think.
[4500.90s -> 4502.34s]  Increases attack bar by 10%.
[4502.34s -> 4503.70s]  Yeah, let's put this down here.
[4503.70s -> 4509.88s]  Just don't get hit and just do more damage.
[4509.88s -> 4510.60s]  That sounds good to me.
[4514.47s -> 4514.95s]  All right.
[4515.69s -> 4517.13s]  Gear and icons.
[4521.37s -> 4522.17s]  They have these.
[4522.17s -> 4523.37s]  I don't think I unlocked anything new.
[4523.37s -> 4523.61s]  No.
[4523.61s -> 4523.85s]  All right.
[4523.85s -> 4524.41s]  Abilities.
[4524.41s -> 4524.89s]  Here we go.
[4524.89s -> 4525.05s]  All right.
[4525.05s -> 4525.69s]  What do I got?
[4525.69s -> 4526.49s]  115?
[4527.21s -> 4535.85s]  Should I upgrade Scarlet Cyclone?
[4536.65s -> 4537.77s]  Probably should get all these first.
[4538.33s -> 4539.13s]  Magic Burst?
[4539.13s -> 4540.57s]  Oh, actually, I use this all the time.
[4541.29s -> 4542.33s]  I use this all the time.
[4542.97s -> 4547.10s]  This is my move.
[4551.99s -> 4552.87s]  It's either that or...
[4553.59s -> 4556.76s]  I'm doing it.
[4558.01s -> 4558.73s]  This is my move.
[4559.86s -> 4560.74s]  You see me do it a lot.
[4561.38s -> 4562.50s]  All right.
[4562.50s -> 4563.06s]  Now I'm gonna...
[4564.60s -> 4565.16s]  I'll get this.
[4566.28s -> 4568.04s]  Put this well in the air to slice down.
[4568.76s -> 4572.86s]  Cool.
[4572.86s -> 4573.26s]  Taunt?
[4573.82s -> 4578.52s]  R2 plus that button to pull an enemy?
[4581.64s -> 4582.44s]  Swift Recovery.
[4583.24s -> 4583.96s]  That's important.
[4588.55s -> 4588.95s]  Stomp.
[4589.51s -> 4592.95s]  Kick off a nearby enemy, increasing jump height.
[4592.95s -> 4593.27s]  Yeah.
[4593.27s -> 4594.47s]  I mean, just all the cheap ones.
[4594.47s -> 4595.27s]  I'll just get them all.
[4595.99s -> 4600.09s]  Okay.
[4600.09s -> 4600.57s]  Cool.
[4600.57s -> 4605.70s]  Do you believe in dolphins?
[4606.42s -> 4608.90s]  Do you mean, do I believe that the animal, the dolphins, exist?
[4609.62s -> 4612.98s]  Or do I believe that the dolphins will win the Super Bowl eventually?
[4612.98s -> 4613.46s]  What do you mean?
[4614.34s -> 4615.62s]  Like, do I believe in the dolphins
[4615.62s -> 4617.86s]  or do I believe that a dolphin as an animal exists?
[4618.66s -> 4621.62s]  I feel like you mean, like,
[4621.62s -> 4624.26s]  do I believe in the dolphins, like the football team?
[4628.63s -> 4631.22s]  Which, not a great season last year.
[4632.02s -> 4633.46s]  Not a good season last year.
[4634.18s -> 4637.19s]  What did they do?
[4637.83s -> 4638.39s]  Fucking...
[4639.19s -> 4641.88s]  What was their record last year?
[4642.76s -> 4648.14s]  Dolphins did, like, they were all right last year.
[4652.23s -> 4652.87s]  Nine and eight?
[4655.29s -> 4656.49s]  Jeez, could get a little better.
[4657.13s -> 4665.02s]  Jesus.
[4668.20s -> 4668.92s]  The dragon?
[4670.46s -> 4671.50s]  Wait, wasn't that my name?
[4673.50s -> 4687.19s]  I'll get, I'll hit you with the Precision Dodge all day.
[4700.60s -> 4701.48s]  2300!
[4716.94s -> 4718.81s]  I'm gonna hit you with,
[4718.81s -> 4720.25s]  I'm gonna hit you with Precision every day.
[4721.05s -> 4739.96s]  Ow!
[4740.20s -> 4740.70s]  Torgl!
[4741.32s -> 4753.55s]  Dude, Jerma is so precise.
[4754.19s -> 4755.28s]  That's what I like to hear.
[4755.84s -> 4764.67s]  Dragon Talon?
[4766.68s -> 4768.04s]  Ooh, using it in crafting.
[4771.37s -> 4772.33s]  No one said that.
[4772.33s -> 4773.61s]  Go look at the logs, yes they did.
[4774.17s -> 4778.24s]  Must be a nest nearby.
[4779.20s -> 4787.07s]  Keep your eyes open.
[4787.07s -> 4788.19s]  Can I have a heal, Torgl?
[4800.11s -> 4802.11s]  Insufficient inventory space, potion used.
[4802.11s -> 4803.23s]  Oh, I'm out of room.
[4803.23s -> 4804.99s]  It appears we won't be going this way.
[4811.34s -> 4819.10s]  What is it, Torgl?
[4821.07s -> 4821.63s]  Got something!
[4825.42s -> 4827.02s]  Why trust in your own animal instinct
[4827.02s -> 4829.42s]  when you now have an actual animal at your side?
[4829.98s -> 4832.70s]  If you're lost, hold down L3,
[4832.70s -> 4837.56s]  and let Torgl point you in the right direction.
[4837.56s -> 4840.60s]  Ooh, you're so smart.
[4844.81s -> 4845.31s]  No!
[4849.58s -> 4851.26s]  Okay, here we go.
[4851.90s -> 4853.82s]  There we go, that's what I was trying to do.
[4853.82s -> 4854.78s]  That's what I was going for.
[4862.40s -> 4863.12s]  Oh, a treat!
[4871.72s -> 4874.60s]  My mouse is on the unsubscribe button.
[4874.60s -> 4875.80s]  You better be careful.
[4877.31s -> 4878.19s]  I was careful.
[4880.62s -> 4881.50s]  Hovering over it.
[4907.98s -> 4909.02s]  New enemies approaching.
[4910.72s -> 4911.76s]  This is stupid.
[4920.96s -> 4924.86s]  All right, give it to this thing first.
[4940.70s -> 4941.20s]  Cool.
[4950.44s -> 4955.61s]  You're so precise.
[4956.09s -> 4962.60s]  Did you give your thoughts on the Mario RPG remake?
[4962.60s -> 4963.08s]  I did.
[4963.08s -> 4964.28s]  It went like this.
[4965.00s -> 4975.84s]  Just make sure you take that image
[4975.84s -> 4979.44s]  and like blow the contrast up times a thousand.
[4979.44s -> 4981.52s]  Make my eyes wicked blue.
[4981.92s -> 4983.28s]  What a wicked blue.
[4983.28s -> 4984.96s]  Way blue, more blue than they really are.
[4985.84s -> 4988.08s]  And then superimpose that on top of any other topic.
[5006.20s -> 5007.88s]  Yeah, I'm very excited about it.
[5007.88s -> 5009.08s]  Like one of my favorite.
[5009.08s -> 5010.28s]  Yeah, no guys.
[5010.28s -> 5013.88s]  One of my favorite games ever created.
[5013.88s -> 5015.56s]  Ever since I was a child.
[5016.52s -> 5017.64s]  No, I don't.
[5017.64s -> 5019.08s]  You know, whatever.
[5019.08s -> 5021.08s]  Whoa, whoopsie, whoopsie daisy.
[5022.36s -> 5023.69s]  Whoopsie daisy.
[5024.41s -> 5029.24s]  I'm very excited for it.
[5029.24s -> 5043.16s]  Boss fight.
[5043.96s -> 5047.12s]  All right, make sure you get your...
[5047.12s -> 5049.04s]  Look at how precisely his comments ready.
[5049.84s -> 5053.08s]  I'd like to see them very soon.
[5072.75s -> 5074.00s]  All right.
[5074.62s -> 5086.18s]  Ow!
[5086.48s -> 5092.40s]  All right, all right, all right.
[5093.20s -> 5094.08s]  We just got real here.
[5109.88s -> 5111.32s]  Oh, shit, that really hurt.
[5112.28s -> 5123.31s]  Oh, it takes a little bit longer.
[5124.81s -> 5127.61s]  Oh, look at how precise he is.
[5135.93s -> 5149.28s]  Shit, I could have gotten it every time.
[5149.28s -> 5149.92s]  Nobody said that.
[5149.92s -> 5150.42s]  I did.
[5151.12s -> 5154.86s]  All right, let's go.
[5155.50s -> 5171.02s]  That wasn't bad.
[5182.12s -> 5185.32s]  Oh, my God.
[5188.08s -> 5188.48s]  What?
[5188.48s -> 5190.08s]  Oh, God damn it.
[5192.32s -> 5222.51s]  Oh, I thought I dodged it.
[5223.15s -> 5226.08s]  No, I wanted to...
[5226.80s -> 5246.99s]  Charge it.
[5257.32s -> 5259.00s]  All right, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[5272.92s -> 5273.56s]  See you later.
[5286.01s -> 5286.97s]  All right, I'm gonna end it like this.
[5286.97s -> 5287.77s]  One, two, three.
[5287.77s -> 5288.27s]  Goodbye.
[5293.28s -> 5296.01s]  I will never stop spamming caps.
[5296.01s -> 5297.61s]  Well, you're gonna get timed out.
[5298.17s -> 5302.03s]  Pretty good precision, I think.
[5311.18s -> 5311.98s]  Move your camera.
[5312.94s -> 5313.66s]  Where do I go with it?
[5314.30s -> 5316.26s]  Right here?
[5319.48s -> 5319.98s]  Phase two?
[5346.57s -> 5347.69s]  That was actually pretty...
[5348.57s -> 5349.37s]  That was pretty crazy.
[5365.61s -> 5367.69s]  Oh, bloody Rome of strapping young lads.
[5368.33s -> 5370.60s]  And it was this sorry sack of bones,
[5370.60s -> 5371.96s]  Rome, who saw fit to home.
[5372.76s -> 5378.28s]  He's so cool.
[5379.16s -> 5379.66s]  Sid.
[5380.04s -> 5380.92s]  Did he like that with...
[5387.34s -> 5389.10s]  That's a good image.
[5389.10s -> 5390.94s]  But I don't want to put it on screen.
[5391.50s -> 5392.46s]  What's in it for me?
[5393.10s -> 5394.70s]  The same as for all of us.
[5395.58s -> 5397.10s]  What we want and deserve.
[5398.70s -> 5400.14s]  Save for our knack.
[5400.14s -> 5402.94s]  Dominance and bearers are no different from anyone else.
[5403.98s -> 5406.70s]  The ability to use magic or summon great beasts
[5406.70s -> 5407.90s]  should command respect,
[5407.90s -> 5409.66s]  but instead has left us outcasts.
[5410.22s -> 5412.62s]  Our kind are used and discarded like tools,
[5412.62s -> 5413.66s]  yet we are men.
[5413.66s -> 5415.18s]  So why must we die as less?
[5415.98s -> 5416.48s]  I see.
[5417.18s -> 5419.90s]  So what you're saying is you want to start a war.
[5421.34s -> 5424.88s]  You flatter me, lad.
[5425.52s -> 5429.04s]  But my days as a firebrand are long behind me.
[5429.04s -> 5431.68s]  No, I only wish to offer our kind of choice.
[5432.40s -> 5434.80s]  A place where we can die on our own terms.
[5435.76s -> 5436.88s]  Hey.
[5439.28s -> 5440.24s]  Take a big shove.
[5440.88s -> 5449.26s]  How do you feel, good boy?
[5449.82s -> 5459.63s]  Can I give him a treat, too?
[5459.63s -> 5460.59s]  Mejmer was like, here!
[5461.15s -> 5466.88s]  He was like, anything I'm missing here?
[5470.57s -> 5471.21s]  Damn.
[5471.21s -> 5476.54s]  Okay.
[5476.54s -> 5477.98s]  Let's make sure I didn't miss anything.
[5477.98s -> 5490.72s]  What exactly do you plan on doing
[5490.72s -> 5492.32s]  when you find this dominant of fire?
[5492.88s -> 5493.68s]  What do you think?
[5494.40s -> 5496.81s]  I'll show him the mercy he showed my brother
[5497.45s -> 5498.89s]  and cut out the tongue of any man
[5498.89s -> 5500.25s]  who tries to talk me out of it.
[5501.05s -> 5501.55s]  All right.
[5502.57s -> 5503.93s]  Forest Dark enough as it is.
[5503.93s -> 5529.24s]  I'm just taking it in.
[5539.98s -> 5541.10s]  Level 11 Hornets.
[5541.82s -> 5559.96s]  Level 11 Hornets.
[5560.68s -> 5564.81s]  Yeah, the soundtrack is so good.
[5564.81s -> 5565.45s]  I love it.
[5569.93s -> 5572.81s]  Yeah, you know when I'm asking for OSTs?
[5572.81s -> 5573.93s]  Like, oh, man, I was here.
[5573.93s -> 5574.97s]  OST, you guys want to do?
[5574.97s -> 5575.61s]  I already got one.
[5576.57s -> 5577.37s]  I'll put on this one.
[5589.42s -> 5590.88s]  Put it over here?
[5591.60s -> 5593.80s]  Okay.
[5593.80s -> 5594.52s]  I'm going over here.
[5595.32s -> 5604.00s]  Whoa.
[5604.70s -> 5615.24s]  Okay, easy, easy.
[5619.60s -> 5624.60s]  I thought I dodged it.
[5627.16s -> 5628.04s]  My Wounds Boy.
[5629.08s -> 5646.32s]  Not bad.
[5668.73s -> 5690.43s]  All right.
[5690.43s -> 5691.23s]  Bloody hides.
[5695.58s -> 5696.06s]  Ocean.
[5696.06s -> 5696.70s]  Actually, I need to.
[5699.60s -> 5699.92s]  Okay.
[5699.92s -> 5700.80s]  Something in this cave.
[5704.72s -> 5705.28s]  Meteorite.
[5711.04s -> 5712.08s]  Dude, epic, Jerma.
[5712.08s -> 5712.56s]  Great job.
[5712.56s -> 5712.80s]  Thanks.
[5713.44s -> 5724.67s]  Yeah, I'm off.
[5724.67s -> 5727.88s]  Stop talking to yourself.
[5727.88s -> 5729.56s]  That's literally a live streamer.
[5757.40s -> 5758.28s]  You don't need to lower check.
[5763.76s -> 5769.02s]  Excellent.
[5775.74s -> 5776.30s]  We move.
[5776.94s -> 5779.26s]  Dude, I forgot everything.
[5779.26s -> 5779.50s]  Please.
[5779.50s -> 5780.38s]  Can I have a lower check?
[5780.38s -> 5781.42s]  I don't understand.
[5781.42s -> 5792.41s]  It is true.
[5792.41s -> 5795.21s]  My leech values loyalty above all else.
[5797.13s -> 5799.45s]  But where are you not quick to betray your countrymen
[5799.45s -> 5800.73s]  for the promise of coin?
[5802.73s -> 5803.05s]  God.
[5804.25s -> 5813.71s]  Damn.
[5813.71s -> 5829.90s]  Benedicta Harmon, commander of Waluld's elite intelligences.
[5830.62s -> 5833.92s]  We can capture her.
[5833.92s -> 5836.78s]  What did you do that for?
[5836.78s -> 5839.82s]  You.
[5839.82s -> 5840.62s]  She was showing off.
[5843.61s -> 5845.37s]  If you could make magic come out of your hands,
[5845.37s -> 5847.05s]  you wouldn't just show off randomly to your friends.
[5849.74s -> 5850.94s]  Imagine the birthday parties.
[5850.94s -> 5852.22s]  You'd be able to make so much cooler.
[5853.20s -> 5854.48s]  Let's get this over with.
[5854.48s -> 5864.40s]  At least they're not giant lizards.
[5864.40s -> 5864.88s]  Let's go.
[5867.12s -> 5867.92s]  You're already dead.
[5869.52s -> 5871.36s]  That guy was lying on the ground when we got over here.
[5872.24s -> 5889.29s]  Ow, that hurt.
[5916.73s -> 5919.90s]  Oh, it's rank time.
[5919.90s -> 5920.46s]  Oh, my God.
[5921.10s -> 5921.58s]  You're clear.
[5932.86s -> 5933.66s]  Get up.
[5933.66s -> 5948.75s]  Big damage.
[5948.75s -> 5949.23s]  Big damage.
[5950.28s -> 5950.92s]  Oh, my God.
[5954.36s -> 5956.92s]  Cinematic clash when the screen flashes orange like this
[5956.92s -> 5957.88s]  during a pivotal moment.
[5957.88s -> 5958.84s]  Repeat it.
[5958.84s -> 5959.88s]  Don't even tell me anything else.
[5960.76s -> 5981.00s]  I'll never fail one of those ever.
[6003.66s -> 6004.06s]  That hurt.
[6007.53s -> 6009.66s]  Ready to go.
[6042.94s -> 6045.56s]  Everybody get up.
[6064.04s -> 6064.60s]  Buton?
[6065.56s -> 6066.44s]  What's Buton?
[6078.94s -> 6079.82s]  Oh, I'm going to die.
[6079.82s -> 6083.69s]  I'm not.
[6102.20s -> 6102.44s]  Tap.
[6118.75s -> 6119.07s]  Again.
[6126.49s -> 6127.13s]  Oh, shit.
[6128.41s -> 6133.05s]  The boss fights are so fucking fun.
[6133.05s -> 6134.01s]  I'm just telling you.
[6143.24s -> 6144.68s]  Badge of Might is an accessory.
[6145.40s -> 6149.00s]  Oh, it is.
[6149.00s -> 6149.48s]  Okay.
[6149.48s -> 6150.76s]  Attack by seven.
[6150.76s -> 6152.06s]  Look at how precise that was.
[6152.06s -> 6153.42s]  That's not even a boss either.
[6153.42s -> 6153.82s]  Really.
[6159.64s -> 6160.36s]  I'm sleeping right now.
[6160.36s -> 6161.48s]  My dreams are kind of weird.
[6163.58s -> 6164.70s]  Are you typing?
[6164.70s -> 6170.83s]  What's the face you make when you hit a cinematic slash?
[6170.83s -> 6171.23s]  This one.
[6171.95s -> 6176.19s]  They thought we were Imperials.
[6178.64s -> 6179.84s]  You do look the part.
[6179.84s -> 6187.10s]  Fight like a true shield of Rosaria.
[6187.10s -> 6189.69s]  Blast by the phoenix of that.
[6190.41s -> 6192.48s]  What's wrong with that face?
[6193.20s -> 6204.60s]  Speaking of which, I wonder.
[6204.60s -> 6207.66s]  Does the other icon of fire give blessings, do you think?
[6209.29s -> 6210.17s]  You don't believe me.
[6211.13s -> 6216.28s]  And lo, the creator did make of the elements eight icons
[6216.28s -> 6218.12s]  to serve as keepers of the one roar.
[6221.04s -> 6223.84s]  Not that I've ever set too much store by holy doctrine.
[6224.56s -> 6226.24s]  But on that point, it's clear.
[6227.12s -> 6233.92s]  Fire has always had just the one warden as of all the rest.
[6233.92s -> 6236.40s]  A new one can't be born until the previous dies.
[6237.20s -> 6238.56s]  And even that can take years.
[6239.68s -> 6245.07s]  Thank God the face game is too scary for me.
[6245.71s -> 6252.76s]  You don't strike me as a liar, which leaves but one person
[6252.76s -> 6255.00s]  who might be able to shed some light on the matter.
[6256.22s -> 6257.58s]  And they're in a lost swing.
[6261.69s -> 6262.33s]  Oh, son.
[6262.33s -> 6263.21s]  What game are you playing?
[6263.21s -> 6265.45s]  Can you catch me up on the plot before I walk upstairs?
[6267.61s -> 6270.78s]  What if someone discovers the bodies?
[6271.58s -> 6274.03s]  Well, they'll be sorely disappointed.
[6276.35s -> 6288.27s]  Stage replay in arcade mode.
[6288.27s -> 6290.11s]  Is it an arcade mode?
[6290.11s -> 6292.68s]  In the hideaway.
[6293.24s -> 6297.16s]  So you can just kind of do just wonder what arcade mode is.
[6297.16s -> 6308.12s]  So this is Orbel Downs.
[6308.76s -> 6310.46s]  All right, so there's new missions back here.
[6310.46s -> 6311.74s]  I kind of want to upgrade my weapon.
[6312.38s -> 6313.69s]  Or should I just keep going?
[6317.45s -> 6319.13s]  There's a new side quest back here.
[6319.13s -> 6323.88s]  I think I should upgrade.
[6324.44s -> 6328.76s]  I want to check it out.
[6328.76s -> 6331.60s]  Hey, you do you?
[6332.48s -> 6332.80s]  Yeah.
[6333.44s -> 6340.06s]  New crafting recipe is available.
[6347.53s -> 6348.33s]  Longsword.
[6349.74s -> 6350.94s]  Longsword's better than...
[6350.94s -> 6354.11s]  Wait, okay.
[6356.43s -> 6357.63s]  Longsword, how much money do I have?
[6358.19s -> 6358.83s]  I got money.
[6368.04s -> 6369.72s]  Is it worth spending 700 right now?
[6381.95s -> 6383.39s]  I could craft a longsword.
[6384.11s -> 6386.84s]  Or I could do this broadsword plus one
[6388.00s -> 6389.68s]  as good as just crap.
[6389.68s -> 6391.60s]  Maybe I should craft a longsword and upgrade a longsword.
[6395.24s -> 6397.32s]  This does take a dragon talon, though.
[6397.32s -> 6400.20s]  I would probably just go buy it.
[6402.97s -> 6404.57s]  I'm going to go buy it and then upgrade it.
[6405.29s -> 6409.66s]  Wait, do I?
[6409.66s -> 6410.54s]  No, I don't have one already.
[6411.10s -> 6414.24s]  I don't think you have the longsword equipped.
[6414.24s -> 6416.16s]  Oh, I don't think I have the longsword
[6416.72s -> 6418.32s]  because I bought the broadsword.
[6419.04s -> 6421.28s]  And then the thing I started was the Imperial Infantry Blade.
[6421.28s -> 6422.56s]  It's just the starter weapon.
[6422.56s -> 6423.92s]  I have the broadsword on right now,
[6423.92s -> 6425.28s]  but the longsword looks like it's just better.
[6426.00s -> 6426.88s]  I'm going to buy...
[6427.68s -> 6428.40s]  Is this you own it?
[6430.57s -> 6431.21s]  I don't think so.
[6431.21s -> 6432.89s]  All right, I'll buy it.
[6438.83s -> 6439.79s]  I want to save the materials.
[6444.20s -> 6445.40s]  I'll sell the broadsword back.
[6446.04s -> 6448.04s]  I think that makes sense, right?
[6454.08s -> 6456.56s]  Because crafting this, I have to use a gnarled scale.
[6456.56s -> 6457.76s]  I have two of those.
[6457.76s -> 6458.96s]  With this one, I...
[6458.96s -> 6461.05s]  Oh, yeah, see?
[6461.05s -> 6463.66s]  I have to use a gnarled scale for this.
[6463.66s -> 6465.10s]  Why not just use it on upgrades?
[6465.10s -> 6465.74s]  I have the money.
[6466.30s -> 6468.12s]  Let's go for it.
[6473.82s -> 6474.62s]  I could do it again.
[6480.36s -> 6483.88s]  I have three meteorite, so I'm just going to go again.
[6483.88s -> 6485.08s]  You can find me later.
[6485.64s -> 6487.13s]  I could do it again.
[6487.13s -> 6490.20s]  No, I couldn't.
[6490.20s -> 6491.00s]  Cool.
[6491.00s -> 6493.56s]  All right.
[6493.56s -> 6494.84s]  Keep going.
[6494.84s -> 6495.96s]  I think that's all I can do.
[6495.96s -> 6496.44s]  So let me...
[6496.44s -> 6497.40s]  What about other stuff?
[6499.31s -> 6501.13s]  Iron racers?
[6501.69s -> 6505.47s]  I think I have...
[6506.67s -> 6508.51s]  I could do iron belt plus two.
[6508.51s -> 6510.59s]  Although what about...
[6510.59s -> 6510.99s]  What do you...
[6510.99s -> 6513.79s]  Okay, wolfskin sash.
[6513.79s -> 6514.67s]  28.
[6514.67s -> 6520.73s]  28 versus 26 and two health.
[6520.73s -> 6521.85s]  This one just gives 28.
[6521.85s -> 6523.45s]  28 defense versus health.
[6523.45s -> 6529.50s]  Just don't get hit.
[6529.50s -> 6531.84s]  That's true.
[6531.84s -> 6533.04s]  I'll take the health.
[6533.04s -> 6538.73s]  This is just better, though.
[6538.73s -> 6540.70s]  All right, I'm going to...
[6540.70s -> 6541.50s]  All right, here's what's happening.
[6541.50s -> 6544.16s]  I'm going to make this sash.
[6544.16s -> 6545.20s]  Then I'll upgrade it.
[6545.20s -> 6546.24s]  I do say so myself.
[6546.88s -> 6555.36s]  Okay, so this is going to be good before health.
[6557.76s -> 6559.84s]  Yeah, see, this is only two, even if it's plus two.
[6559.84s -> 6561.60s]  Okay, yeah, we'll do this one plus two.
[6562.24s -> 6563.44s]  You can find me later.
[6564.24s -> 6567.04s]  Trophy earned.
[6567.04s -> 6569.61s]  Okay, cool.
[6569.61s -> 6570.73s]  Can't really do any of these.
[6571.53s -> 6573.64s]  Do I...
[6573.64s -> 6575.24s]  I have iron burses on right now, I do.
[6577.04s -> 6577.92s]  Okay, we're good.
[6580.40s -> 6582.64s]  I should buy some heals, though, right?
[6584.17s -> 6584.89s]  Kind of low.
[6588.22s -> 6588.86s]  Installed.
[6589.50s -> 6592.06s]  Why do you look like a gigachat right now?
[6592.06s -> 6593.66s]  I think I look like gigachat.
[6598.33s -> 6598.73s]  What do you got?
[6598.73s -> 6599.29s]  You got a mission?
[6601.12s -> 6601.60s]  Damn it.
[6601.60s -> 6603.44s]  We'll be needing more wood.
[6603.44s -> 6606.25s]  If I step away to fetch any,
[6606.25s -> 6611.15s]  this lot will be down around our ears.
[6611.15s -> 6611.87s]  Ah, you there.
[6612.51s -> 6613.87s]  Perfect timing.
[6613.87s -> 6616.27s]  I couldn't persuade you to fetch me some timber, could I?
[6616.83s -> 6621.20s]  Ooh, what do I get for it?
[6622.01s -> 6622.97s]  I'd be happy to.
[6624.01s -> 6625.21s]  Oh, thank you.
[6625.21s -> 6627.45s]  You'll be helping me and the hideaway both.
[6628.17s -> 6629.37s]  Side mission.
[6629.37s -> 6629.93s]  Let's go.
[6631.61s -> 6633.21s]  More than we can manage, if I'm honest.
[6633.93s -> 6635.93s]  It certainly looks like you've got your hands full.
[6636.65s -> 6638.25s]  Ah, you can say that again.
[6638.25s -> 6640.73s]  The fallen knew their craft, make no mistake.
[6640.73s -> 6642.89s]  But not even their handiwork lasts forever.
[6642.89s -> 6644.17s]  This guy looks like the kind of person that...
[6644.17s -> 6645.53s]  That's why the walls need shoring up.
[6645.53s -> 6648.97s]  ...always finishes top three in the arm wrestling competition every year.
[6648.97s -> 6650.33s]  ...for our first harvest now, can we?
[6651.29s -> 6654.22s]  No, I suppose not.
[6654.94s -> 6657.98s]  Where can I find this wood?
[6658.94s -> 6660.38s]  Ask over at the white ads.
[6661.02s -> 6662.46s]  They'll point you in the right direction.
[6663.10s -> 6663.98s]  Thanks again.
[6663.98s -> 6664.22s]  Okay.
[6664.22s -> 6665.42s]  I really appreciate the help.
[6667.26s -> 6667.50s]  Yeah.
[6670.80s -> 6672.00s]  Let's prioritize this.
[6672.00s -> 6673.36s]  Let's do some good stuff.
[6676.04s -> 6676.92s]  Hashtag add.
[6676.92s -> 6677.32s]  Oh, yeah.
[6678.20s -> 6680.70s]  Square Enix sponsored this stream.
[6682.86s -> 6684.30s]  I think the game is fantastic.
[6684.94s -> 6686.72s]  I really mean that.
[6686.72s -> 6689.44s]  I am going to finish this game.
[6689.44s -> 6690.56s]  I'm going to play it all the way through.
[6692.59s -> 6693.87s]  I really like it.
[6694.51s -> 6696.75s]  Yeah, it's out on PS5 right now.
[6698.57s -> 6699.61s]  You can also get the demo.
[6699.61s -> 6701.05s]  The demo is still available too.
[6703.88s -> 6705.80s]  Coin purse weighing you down.
[6705.80s -> 6707.32s]  Okay, I want to sell some stuff.
[6707.32s -> 6708.52s]  I'm going to sell the broadsword.
[6708.52s -> 6711.00s]  It's probably a bad idea, but somebody will scream at me.
[6711.00s -> 6712.60s]  I reckon I can find a buyer.
[6712.60s -> 6716.00s]  I'm getting rid of the infantry belt.
[6716.00s -> 6719.28s]  I know, but what about just for drip?
[6719.28s -> 6720.48s]  No, it's fine.
[6721.36s -> 6723.31s]  All right, I got to equip this.
[6723.95s -> 6724.67s]  Come again.
[6731.26s -> 6732.86s]  All right, I don't want to put these ones on.
[6732.86s -> 6737.92s]  This is the rings that give you much more damage and power and stuff.
[6738.48s -> 6740.75s]  I just want this one, the one that I found.
[6747.02s -> 6748.22s]  There is my sword.
[6748.22s -> 6749.10s]  That looks good.
[6749.82s -> 6753.08s]  Okay, yeah, it's only on PS5 right now.
[6756.64s -> 6757.52s]  Only on PS5.
[6762.75s -> 6765.15s]  Can you see the chat's donations things?
[6765.15s -> 6769.71s]  Yeah, like I said before, it's a new feature.
[6769.71s -> 6771.39s]  I don't really know what it is, but I'll look into it.
[6771.39s -> 6774.11s]  I'll see what it is, but I can reiterate.
[6774.11s -> 6776.03s]  I do not read donations or subs on stream.
[6778.03s -> 6783.37s]  I'll say I've had for a long time and could tell you why.
[6784.17s -> 6787.26s]  But already, you know, let's go.
[6789.32s -> 6790.44s]  Excuse me.
[6790.44s -> 6794.08s]  The man working over by the garden sent me to fetch some wood.
[6794.08s -> 6794.96s]  Do I have to cut the wood?
[6794.96s -> 6797.44s]  Ah, that'll be Jeffrey, master carpenter.
[6798.08s -> 6798.80s]  Luck would have it.
[6798.80s -> 6800.64s]  We've just finished cutting the timber he's after.
[6801.44s -> 6803.28s]  You take as much as you need from the stack.
[6804.32s -> 6804.80s]  Thank you.
[6805.60s -> 6806.40s]  So let's just grab it.
[6806.40s -> 6807.28s]  No, not at all.
[6807.28s -> 6808.72s]  We appreciate the assistance.
[6809.60s -> 6814.99s]  Collect the planks.
[6815.55s -> 6818.94s]  Here we are.
[6818.94s -> 6820.01s]  Okay.
[6820.01s -> 6823.29s]  You better get this to Jeffrey, was it?
[6823.69s -> 6826.96s]  Hold on.
[6826.96s -> 6827.68s]  Let me help you here.
[6828.70s -> 6830.46s]  Ah, fuck if I know, man.
[6833.12s -> 6833.92s]  I don't know either.
[6834.48s -> 6846.51s]  I've fetched in that wood.
[6846.51s -> 6847.55s]  Wasn't too much trouble.
[6848.19s -> 6853.31s]  I get money for this.
[6853.87s -> 6854.96s]  Will this be enough?
[6856.27s -> 6857.63s]  This will do nicely.
[6857.63s -> 6858.59s]  Thank you.
[6858.59s -> 6862.03s]  With a bit of luck, the walls won't be falling in on us just yet.
[6862.59s -> 6863.63s]  That sounds ominous.
[6864.27s -> 6868.04s]  It's not as bad as all that.
[6868.04s -> 6870.60s]  And it's a damn sight better than the alternative.
[6870.60s -> 6871.08s]  We're safe.
[6871.08s -> 6872.12s]  We're warm and we're hidden.
[6872.68s -> 6873.72s]  What more could we ask for?
[6874.60s -> 6876.60s]  Now stop fretting and take this.
[6876.60s -> 6877.56s]  You've earned it.
[6877.56s -> 6878.52s]  Welcome to the fold.
[6880.41s -> 6880.81s]  And?
[6880.81s -> 6881.69s]  There's no need to.
[6882.49s -> 6884.49s]  That's not a matter of need, my friend.
[6884.49s -> 6885.45s]  You're one of us now.
[6886.01s -> 6886.81s]  What do I get?
[6887.53s -> 6893.50s]  What do I get?
[6898.51s -> 6899.23s]  Meteorite.
[6899.23s -> 6899.95s]  That's pretty good.
[6899.95s -> 6901.15s]  And a gill bug.
[6901.71s -> 6904.20s]  Contrary to popular belief,
[6904.20s -> 6907.40s]  this small insect does not get its name from its appearance,
[6907.40s -> 6910.28s]  but rather from the fact that it is highly sought after by
[6912.17s -> 6912.81s]  fizzickers?
[6913.45s -> 6914.65s]  Fizzickers?
[6914.65s -> 6916.49s]  For use in brewing medicines.
[6918.59s -> 6920.67s]  In summer, when the beetles are most numerous,
[6920.67s -> 6926.04s]  children across the realm will spend nigh every waking hour collecting specimens
[6926.04s -> 6929.08s]  in readiness to exchange them for a handful of coppers.
[6929.08s -> 6933.56s]  As children have tiny hands, however, this amounts to fewer than one might expect.
[6933.56s -> 6944.62s]  Rate this bug on a tier list.
[6945.26s -> 6946.99s]  I don't know.
[6948.48s -> 6948.72s]  B?
[6949.52s -> 6950.40s]  All right, so I can sell that.
[6951.12s -> 6952.41s]  Should I sell it?
[6952.41s -> 6953.29s]  What if I get more stuff?
[6954.49s -> 6960.14s]  Oh, I'm curious about the arcade mode thing.
[6960.14s -> 6960.78s]  I was supposed to see it.
[6964.17s -> 6968.41s]  Replay any previously cleared stage and be awarded a score based on performance.
[6968.41s -> 6971.13s]  Restrictions on level gear consumables are applied.
[6972.12s -> 6975.16s]  Gameplay mode will default to action focused.
[6975.16s -> 6976.91s]  All right, that's cool.
[6977.47s -> 6979.26s]  Play a little challenge mode.
[6982.91s -> 6983.55s]  Go see...
[6983.55s -> 6984.59s]  Can you go see the moogle?
[6984.59s -> 6985.23s]  Where's the moogle?
[6986.22s -> 6987.26s]  Yeah, sure.
[6987.26s -> 6994.70s]  Where's the moogle?
[6994.70s -> 7000.83s]  Why is everybody doing mag?
[7000.83s -> 7007.02s]  Over by the board?
[7007.66s -> 7012.24s]  What board?
[7012.88s -> 7017.23s]  Why is everybody doing mag?
[7017.23s -> 7018.35s]  What happened?
[7018.35s -> 7021.71s]  Because they want moogle.
[7022.27s -> 7023.72s]  I gotta find moogle.
[7023.72s -> 7024.76s]  All right, let me sell this first.
[7025.32s -> 7028.25s]  Just said to sell this for a lot of money.
[7036.80s -> 7037.28s]  Heal bug.
[7039.12s -> 7040.32s]  Valuable can be sold.
[7043.50s -> 7043.90s]  200?
[7046.30s -> 7047.74s]  Would you eat a bug, be honest?
[7048.46s -> 7050.06s]  I don't know if I had.
[7050.06s -> 7050.38s]  Maybe.
[7051.02s -> 7053.74s]  I wouldn't be happy about it, but it would be like, whatever.
[7053.74s -> 7054.70s]  Do I have to eat bugs?
[7054.70s -> 7055.58s]  I don't know.
[7055.58s -> 7057.26s]  No, I don't know.
[7059.53s -> 7060.17s]  I don't know.
[7060.97s -> 7064.32s]  All right, let's go.
[7064.32s -> 7066.70s]  Wait, quest.
[7075.79s -> 7080.92s]  I want to make as much money as I can.
[7080.92s -> 7082.92s]  Ah, a new face.
[7082.92s -> 7086.43s]  And, dare I hope, a willing pair of hands.
[7086.43s -> 7091.31s]  The fat chocobo is a demanding mistress, and we are too few to keep her on her feet.
[7091.31s -> 7095.55s]  Might I persuade you to offer a meal or two to souls in need of sustenance?
[7096.35s -> 7101.71s]  For your trouble, I can offer you the contents of my strong box and my enduring gratitude.
[7103.55s -> 7104.75s]  There's not going to be anything in there.
[7106.83s -> 7108.27s]  Oh, there's 500 bucks in there.
[7108.99s -> 7110.27s]  And I see why not.
[7111.36s -> 7112.16s]  Marvelous.
[7112.16s -> 7114.80s]  And who exactly do I have the honor of addressing?
[7115.68s -> 7116.18s]  Clive.
[7117.66s -> 7119.90s]  Delighted to make your acquaintance, Clive.
[7119.90s -> 7125.34s]  I'm Kenneth, and mine are the weary shoulders upon which the weight of this fine establishment rests.
[7126.62s -> 7129.90s]  Now, I have three hungry customers awaiting their vittles.
[7129.90s -> 7132.38s]  Take these, if you would, and be careful.
[7132.38s -> 7133.02s]  They're hot.
[7135.21s -> 7136.41s]  I would eat that right now.
[7137.29s -> 7143.48s]  A meal.
[7143.48s -> 7146.28s]  Long as it been.
[7146.28s -> 7147.48s]  Can I just eat them all?
[7152.01s -> 7152.51s]  There you go.
[7155.72s -> 7156.84s]  Your food.
[7156.84s -> 7161.15s]  I was hoping it might be.
[7161.79s -> 7164.19s]  Well, doesn't this look fine?
[7164.19s -> 7164.99s]  Thank you, lad.
[7166.01s -> 7167.45s]  You're new, aren't you?
[7167.45s -> 7170.01s]  Kenneth's running your ragged already, I expect.
[7170.01s -> 7170.97s]  The old rascal.
[7171.85s -> 7172.41s]  Very hot.
[7172.41s -> 7172.81s]  Be careful.
[7172.81s -> 7174.97s]  I didn't say he'd give me something for my trouble.
[7176.70s -> 7177.82s]  And so he should.
[7177.82s -> 7179.74s]  We're not slaves anymore.
[7179.74s -> 7180.78s]  Well met, lad.
[7180.78s -> 7182.30s]  And keep up the good work.
[7188.56s -> 7189.92s]  I'm going to get 500 bucks.
[7194.86s -> 7199.71s]  Yeah.
[7199.71s -> 7202.19s]  Fully clad in armor, bringing your food to your table.
[7202.83s -> 7207.39s]  I hope you do not think me lazy for waiting to be served like a lord.
[7207.39s -> 7210.83s]  I mean, it's like a bunch of themed restaurants do that already, don't they?
[7210.83s -> 7212.75s]  Did not use me kindly, you see.
[7213.39s -> 7216.67s]  You left me half lame, truth be told.
[7217.31s -> 7219.95s]  That Sid took me in nonetheless.
[7220.91s -> 7221.41s]  Precise.
[7223.37s -> 7225.85s]  The hideaway is the home I never knew.
[7226.65s -> 7228.49s]  And a mighty fine one at that.
[7232.67s -> 7233.17s]  Enjoy.
[7234.03s -> 7242.68s]  Any crusty bread?
[7242.68s -> 7249.40s]  How can you have stew and no crusty bread?
[7249.40s -> 7254.19s]  Well, there's so much more to farming than just seeds and soil.
[7254.19s -> 7255.47s]  I'm talking bread that you have to like.
[7257.87s -> 7258.43s]  Your food.
[7259.31s -> 7260.03s]  Just a moment.
[7260.03s -> 7261.39s]  I need to finish this.
[7261.39s -> 7263.00s]  I won't be a burden.
[7263.00s -> 7267.72s]  I'm of no use to anyone as I am, but maybe if I can master this.
[7268.52s -> 7271.93s]  All right, but see that you eat it before it gets cold.
[7272.73s -> 7273.21s]  Of course.
[7275.50s -> 7275.90s]  Thank you.
[7276.54s -> 7279.74s]  If I had a restaurant, I would name it with crusty bread.
[7283.26s -> 7284.78s]  That would be the name of my restaurant.
[7285.42s -> 7286.94s]  With crusty bread.
[7287.50s -> 7293.79s]  It'd be such a really hearty.
[7294.59s -> 7296.35s]  Everybody knows you're gonna when you come in.
[7296.35s -> 7298.11s]  When you when you're here, you come in here.
[7298.11s -> 7299.15s]  Your family in here.
[7299.15s -> 7299.71s]  You know what I mean?
[7300.51s -> 7309.79s]  Wait, did I not feed them?
[7312.83s -> 7314.35s]  Oh, no, no, no, I gotta turn it in.
[7315.87s -> 7317.71s]  All done, I presume.
[7317.71s -> 7318.35s]  Splendid.
[7318.99s -> 7319.79s]  They were bearers.
[7321.05s -> 7324.81s]  Stay away from my family master's pleasure.
[7324.81s -> 7328.22s]  But I'm waiting to be fed like equals.
[7329.04s -> 7333.92s]  Indeed, equality is the very cornerstone upon which our little community has found it.
[7333.92s -> 7335.28s]  You know, everything's gonna be warm.
[7336.00s -> 7336.96s]  Beyond these walls.
[7336.96s -> 7338.32s]  Gonna be like candles and shit.
[7340.08s -> 7342.00s]  Speaking only when spoken to.
[7342.00s -> 7344.16s]  Eating only what scraps our masters.
[7344.16s -> 7346.00s]  We have the best crusty bread.
[7346.00s -> 7348.16s]  The first hot meal here in the city.
[7348.16s -> 7349.44s]  First, many will have known.
[7350.16s -> 7352.48s]  In the hideaway, we are free.
[7352.48s -> 7355.84s]  Truly free to speak as we please, when we please.
[7355.84s -> 7358.24s]  And to eat what and when we desire.
[7359.12s -> 7362.24s]  More than reason enough to trust in Sid's vision, wouldn't you say?
[7362.24s -> 7363.20s]  There's no utensils.
[7363.20s -> 7366.32s]  Now, I promised you something for your trouble, did I not?
[7366.32s -> 7369.36s]  This bread is gonna be so hard and so shit.
[7370.16s -> 7373.92s]  You're gonna have you pull it apart and you're gonna use that as utensils
[7373.92s -> 7375.28s]  to eat your soup and stew and stuff.
[7381.37s -> 7382.89s]  The bread is your utensil.
[7388.40s -> 7389.20s]  And why, right?
[7389.20s -> 7390.00s]  That's pretty good.
[7390.00s -> 7392.56s]  And 500 bucks just, that was all right.
[7394.54s -> 7399.18s]  The table is made out of bread.
[7399.18s -> 7402.46s]  That restaurant would be open for, okay.
[7402.46s -> 7405.26s]  First of all, that restaurant's open for one or two days
[7406.14s -> 7407.66s]  before the whole thing gets closed.
[7409.79s -> 7410.83s]  Everything is edible.
[7413.90s -> 7415.66s]  Somebody's dog is gonna get, you know what I mean?
[7415.66s -> 7417.82s]  An animal is gonna get, like a bear is gonna get into that restaurant.
[7417.82s -> 7418.94s]  It's gonna be a fucking nightmare.
[7419.74s -> 7424.09s]  They'll be like, hey, stop eating the post to the table.
[7424.65s -> 7425.13s]  Oh no.
[7428.43s -> 7430.27s]  Rats, yeah, they'd be all, it'd be animals.
[7430.27s -> 7431.87s]  They'd be just animals all over the place.
[7432.43s -> 7436.67s]  It'd be like a weird cartoon moment where you'd be sitting there eating.
[7436.67s -> 7440.75s]  Oh, did you know that the table is edible?
[7440.75s -> 7442.99s]  And it just cuts down to one of the posts of the table
[7442.99s -> 7447.79s]  and there's a rat just gnawing on the very bottom to have it fall out.
[7447.79s -> 7449.55s]  And it just, the whole table falls
[7449.55s -> 7451.39s]  and my grandpa's soup goes up in his face.
[7456.67s -> 7457.87s]  The whole restaurant is edible.
[7465.87s -> 7467.79s]  The bathroom would have to be normal though.
[7467.79s -> 7469.71s]  The bathroom, it's a normal bathroom.
[7470.43s -> 7473.95s]  We can't have edible fucking urinals and edible toilets, guys.
[7474.51s -> 7476.51s]  The bathroom is a normal bathroom.
[7478.38s -> 7479.26s]  That does not work.
[7480.06s -> 7484.70s]  Why not?
[7487.31s -> 7487.95s]  All right, let's go.
[7487.95s -> 7488.99s]  That was fun.
[7488.99s -> 7489.95s]  I got my upgrades.
[7489.95s -> 7490.91s]  I'm ready to move.
[7490.91s -> 7498.73s]  Let's do the next part.
[7498.73s -> 7500.25s]  No one was thinking that except for you.
[7500.25s -> 7502.01s]  I was thinking ahead, actually.
[7502.01s -> 7504.52s]  I was thinking ahead.
[7504.52s -> 7505.56s]  Go back and get the chest.
[7506.36s -> 7507.56s]  Wait, what do you mean the chest?
[7507.56s -> 7509.48s]  Didn't he just deposit it into my fucking account?
[7523.10s -> 7524.14s]  Any idea what that is?
[7524.14s -> 7525.34s]  They built the village around.
[7525.34s -> 7525.98s]  Get the chest.
[7525.98s -> 7527.26s]  The Fallen Ruin.
[7527.26s -> 7529.61s]  I've heard someone call it an airship.
[7530.25s -> 7532.67s]  Though its flying days seem to be behind it.
[7533.55s -> 7534.65s]  It's a shame, that.
[7535.29s -> 7539.05s]  Do you truly think her dominance waiting for us in that village?
[7539.69s -> 7542.17s]  My scout has never given me any reason to doubt him,
[7543.05s -> 7544.73s]  which is why I think we should hurry.
[7544.73s -> 7545.23s]  Come on.
[7545.93s -> 7550.68s]  Just give me one second to go back.
[7551.32s -> 7559.58s]  A tuning with an obelisk allows Clive to travel quickly to the location
[7559.58s -> 7568.12s]  via both the world map and local map.
[7568.12s -> 7569.40s]  Louder than words.
[7571.04s -> 7571.76s]  Let me go back to the...
[7573.12s -> 7574.48s]  Are you guys messing with me here?
[7575.44s -> 7576.08s]  Is that for real?
[7576.72s -> 7579.32s]  This isn't the first time I've seen one of these.
[7579.32s -> 7581.47s]  Perhaps I can use them as waymarks.
[7584.88s -> 7586.08s]  Are you guys being for real?
[7586.80s -> 7591.95s]  Is there actually something in here?
[7591.95s -> 7593.55s]  Is there a chest I didn't get on the table?
[7594.11s -> 7606.56s]  Do you think we should go and help?
[7607.77s -> 7608.89s]  Oh, there is.
[7608.89s -> 7610.09s]  I thought you guys were lying to me.
[7611.21s -> 7611.93s]  Okay.
[7611.93s -> 7612.73s]  Hold on.
[7612.73s -> 7615.20s]  It's important.
[7615.20s -> 7615.60s]  Thank you.
[7616.32s -> 7623.05s]  That was badge of metal defense.
[7623.05s -> 7624.01s]  Yeah, we're gonna put that on.
[7624.01s -> 7624.57s]  Of course we are.
[7638.89s -> 7639.85s]  Let's go back.
[7640.57s -> 7654.11s]  Guys, your face came weird.
[7656.19s -> 7656.91s]  This is my face.
[7657.71s -> 7659.56s]  And you can say my face is weird.
[7659.56s -> 7661.72s]  I mean, rude.
[7661.72s -> 7663.96s]  But that's your opinion on how you feel about my face.
[7666.22s -> 7670.00s]  I also have an opinion that your opinion is...
[7671.68s -> 7673.63s]  No, let's just play.
[7673.63s -> 7675.79s]  Why is it so small?
[7675.79s -> 7676.19s]  It's not...
[7676.19s -> 7677.55s]  I want you to focus on the gameplay.
[7681.28s -> 7681.92s]  Definitely, foe.
[7682.40s -> 7686.36s]  I don't know, Sid.
[7686.92s -> 7689.71s]  It really depends on if you start hearing music or not
[7689.71s -> 7690.51s]  when we walk up here.
[7691.07s -> 7694.00s]  Do you hear it?
[7696.28s -> 7697.08s]  No?
[7697.08s -> 7698.64s]  They might be friends.
[7703.77s -> 7704.49s]  Yeah.
[7704.49s -> 7705.47s]  Let's go!
[7729.69s -> 7730.17s]  Damn!
[7731.13s -> 7744.20s]  Dude, you're blocking gameplay.
[7744.20s -> 7745.56s]  I am not blocking gameplay.
[7745.56s -> 7746.44s]  I'm going to purposefully spot.
[7752.81s -> 7755.05s]  Combat looks so fucking fun.
[7756.03s -> 7759.53s]  Combat is so freaking fun.
[7760.25s -> 7769.56s]  No, it actually is.
[7771.69s -> 7776.84s]  You're in the center of the screen.
[7777.56s -> 7778.84s]  I think I'm in a perfect spot.
[7779.48s -> 7783.16s]  This is right over the stuff down here.
[7783.16s -> 7784.04s]  I'm not blocking anything.
[7787.21s -> 7788.41s]  No sign of the Royalists.
[7789.13s -> 7791.13s]  Else for that matter.
[7792.19s -> 7796.49s]  It's too bloody even for this hour.
[7796.49s -> 7797.29s]  What do we do now?
[7797.85s -> 7799.90s]  First, we look for my scout.
[7799.90s -> 7800.78s]  You start here.
[7800.78s -> 7801.98s]  I'll circle around the back.
[7802.78s -> 7805.12s]  How do I let you know if I find him?
[7806.00s -> 7806.89s]  Good question.
[7808.22s -> 7811.45s]  Shout?
[7811.45s -> 7811.95s]  Subtle.
[7818.97s -> 7823.05s]  The combat director of the game, Ryota Suzuki,
[7823.69s -> 7827.77s]  which, uh, Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma.
[7827.77s -> 7828.33s]  I'm curious.
[7829.56s -> 7831.96s]  You're like, wow, that combat looks really great.
[7832.68s -> 7833.88s]  Combat director of the game.
[7835.12s -> 7838.04s]  So the village can't be complete.
[7838.04s -> 7839.32s]  Very, very cool.
[7840.60s -> 7841.48s]  All right.
[7841.48s -> 7843.32s]  This looks like I have to pay attention here.
[7849.68s -> 7850.16s]  Very cool.
[7850.16s -> 7850.96s]  Very cool.
[7850.96s -> 7851.76s]  Very cool.
[7851.76s -> 7852.26s]  Okay.
[7856.25s -> 7856.89s]  I hear music.
[7862.48s -> 7863.60s]  That sounds like a child.
[7864.72s -> 7869.69s]  Everything all right?
[7870.33s -> 7871.12s]  It's all right.
[7871.12s -> 7872.24s]  We should play Dragon's Dogma sometime.
[7872.24s -> 7872.96s]  I'm not one of them.
[7873.60s -> 7874.56s]  My friend and I were.
[7875.12s -> 7876.01s]  I saw Sturve.
[7876.01s -> 7876.81s]  We did Imperial Army.
[7876.81s -> 7877.77s]  Sturve made a video on it.
[7877.77s -> 7878.49s]  We've come to help.
[7878.49s -> 7879.13s]  It's funny.
[7879.13s -> 7880.49s]  Do you know where your parents are?
[7882.06s -> 7884.30s]  In the church.
[7885.10s -> 7888.09s]  Then I'm going to find them and make sure they're safe.
[7889.55s -> 7891.63s]  Can you stay hidden here until then?
[7892.35s -> 7896.16s]  To the church then.
[7896.16s -> 7896.66s]  Go.
[7897.20s -> 7899.84s]  But not yet because I want to see if you have any, uh,
[7900.72s -> 7901.76s]  hidden gil anywhere.
[7902.32s -> 7915.68s]  I feel like it's a lot more urgent than this.
[7916.48s -> 7919.60s]  What is he doing over there?
[7920.88s -> 7923.61s]  Is he mocking this entire situation?
[7924.41s -> 7927.74s]  Just skipping around.
[7928.46s -> 7930.46s]  I think I don't think I missed nothing.
[7939.13s -> 7939.77s]  Stop skipping.
[7939.77s -> 7941.45s]  You're breaking my immersion.
[7941.45s -> 7942.01s]  The church.
[7942.01s -> 7942.41s]  I know.
[7942.41s -> 7943.45s]  I'm one step ahead of you.
[7944.64s -> 7945.14s]  True.
[7945.60s -> 7962.20s]  Can you speak in a British accent for that entire stream?
[7962.84s -> 7964.84s]  No, but 5,000 of you will leave.
[7964.84s -> 7965.88s]  You hate when I do that.
[7965.88s -> 7966.92s]  Everybody hates when I do that.
[7967.48s -> 7968.30s]  More than anything.
[7975.48s -> 7976.68s]  Everybody hates it.
[7987.64s -> 7990.44s]  This man's gonna die if we don't get into a healer.
[7990.44s -> 7992.36s]  Enough of your barking, dog!
[8003.79s -> 8005.39s]  That was fucking awesome.
[8007.39s -> 8007.95s]  Didn't even...
[8009.15s -> 8010.03s]  That was...
[8010.03s -> 8011.55s]  I loved that so much.
[8014.51s -> 8015.71s]  It was just right on cue.
[8016.99s -> 8019.39s]  Enough of your barking, dog.
[8019.39s -> 8019.89s]  Boom.
[8020.43s -> 8021.71s]  Not even a small second.
[8021.71s -> 8023.15s]  It was right when he was done talking.
[8025.10s -> 8026.22s]  Just right in the back of the head.
[8034.25s -> 8036.40s]  He's with me.
[8036.40s -> 8037.20s]  Is this everyone?
[8038.06s -> 8038.78s]  No.
[8038.78s -> 8040.06s]  There were others.
[8040.06s -> 8043.82s]  A pair of royalists came for the bearers just before you arrived.
[8043.82s -> 8045.02s]  Was a dominant among them?
[8048.73s -> 8049.45s]  Maybe.
[8049.45s -> 8051.29s]  It's not like you is old in a sign.
[8062.84s -> 8063.56s]  Oh, shit.
[8068.70s -> 8070.92s]  This is great.
[8070.92s -> 8072.12s]  We're just chasing this guy?
[8072.84s -> 8074.28s]  We actually have to chase this guy down.
[8082.91s -> 8083.47s]  Oh, shit.
[8084.44s -> 8086.20s]  The really good part of the song is starting.
[8086.20s -> 8087.48s]  That means I'm dead.
[8087.48s -> 8088.92s]  I'm dead in like 10 seconds.
[8089.72s -> 8091.82s]  I gotta run as fast as I fucking can.
[8092.70s -> 8097.84s]  As long as I don't hear those fucking trumpets, mate,
[8097.84s -> 8098.88s]  I'm gonna be just fine.
[8123.60s -> 8124.72s]  That big turkey leg.
[8132.52s -> 8133.48s]  Will you join me?
[8135.40s -> 8135.96s]  My thanks.
[8138.12s -> 8139.72s]  To our lady of the wind.
[8140.36s -> 8141.08s]  And the king.
[8148.25s -> 8150.33s]  Imperials drink this piss?
[8150.33s -> 8153.29s]  Well, it would go some way to explain their breath.
[8156.99s -> 8157.95s]  You are disgusting.
[8158.75s -> 8160.99s]  Everybody back nowadays were gross.
[8160.99s -> 8163.87s]  We had disgusting breath and smelly bodies.
[8163.87s -> 8164.75s]  We all smell.
[8165.55s -> 8172.73s]  And instead of killing them,
[8172.73s -> 8174.81s]  you lead the rats straight to us.
[8175.37s -> 8175.85s]  Mercy.
[8178.65s -> 8179.53s]  This poor guy.
[8180.65s -> 8182.65s]  This poor guy had to run into...
[8182.65s -> 8184.33s]  Oh, I feel bad for this guy.
[8184.33s -> 8185.45s]  That was just so...
[8185.45s -> 8186.33s]  That was so bad.
[8188.11s -> 8189.55s]  An imperial bearer.
[8191.44s -> 8193.44s]  But I was getting bored.
[8203.56s -> 8204.36s]  Recruited that guy.
[8239.13s -> 8242.73s]  What is that thing?
[8242.73s -> 8243.23s]  Torgl!
[8247.29s -> 8250.49s]  I have no potions.
[8250.49s -> 8251.69s]  I have to actually be really careful here.
[8313.95s -> 8314.45s]  Let's go!
[8315.63s -> 8337.58s]  I love ending it like that with a charged shot.
[8337.58s -> 8339.39s]  This feels so good.
[8339.39s -> 8350.88s]  You have the worst face cam out of any streamer I know.
[8350.88s -> 8352.32s]  Uh, all right.
[8352.32s -> 8362.81s]  This is a cam, whatever.
[8377.07s -> 8377.47s]  Turn it off.
[8377.47s -> 8378.51s]  They don't appreciate it.
[8382.43s -> 8384.67s]  Don't recall you complaining, Benedicta.
[8391.74s -> 8392.24s]  So.
[8393.48s -> 8394.36s]  Sedolphus.
[8395.79s -> 8396.99s]  Remind me.
[8396.99s -> 8399.23s]  Why was it that you betrayed your kingdom?
[8402.68s -> 8404.04s]  I asked you a question.
[8405.08s -> 8406.04s]  Lord Commander.
[8406.76s -> 8407.96s]  Why'd she keep saying that, Cid?
[8408.60s -> 8409.64s]  Cid, what's going on here?
[8409.64s -> 8410.36s]  Why?
[8410.36s -> 8414.51s]  Because I've had enough of you and your king's antics.
[8417.26s -> 8421.34s]  And yet here you are, stealing my branded.
[8422.73s -> 8423.69s]  What are you plotting?
[8424.65s -> 8426.25s]  As if I'd tell you.
[8426.25s -> 8427.85s]  This wasn't in the lore, check.
[8427.85s -> 8429.85s]  I looked at it before I even started hanging out with you.
[8430.65s -> 8432.30s]  Did you lie on your resume?
[8433.02s -> 8436.04s]  Lady Benedicta!
[8436.04s -> 8437.64s]  We have secured the dominant.
[8443.00s -> 8449.93s]  Who's that guy?
[8450.73s -> 8457.74s]  Okay!
[8458.20s -> 8459.84s]  That's Gav.
[8459.84s -> 8464.08s]  That's Cid's faithful scout who puts his legendary nose to work
[8464.08s -> 8466.08s]  in tracking the movements of slaver soldiers
[8466.08s -> 8468.56s]  and any other object of interest to the hideaway.
[8469.52s -> 8474.32s]  The ever-agreeable fellow only too gladly delving behind enemy lines
[8474.32s -> 8476.40s]  if he can get a good story out of it or two.
[8476.40s -> 8479.74s]  Okay, good, cool.
[8479.74s -> 8481.61s]  Let me just, remind me again.
[8482.25s -> 8484.06s]  Commander of the Kingdom of...
[8484.06s -> 8484.86s]  Okay.
[8484.86s -> 8491.39s]  All right, got it, got it.
[8493.95s -> 8503.15s]  Finally explaining the lore.
[8503.15s -> 8505.15s]  I told you last week when we played the demo.
[8506.51s -> 8508.51s]  I unironically think that is the best,
[8508.51s -> 8510.27s]  one of the best features of this game.
[8512.91s -> 8513.63s]  I want more of that.
[8521.23s -> 8522.80s]  Trust me.
[8522.80s -> 8530.46s]  Especially for a game that's, you know, you come back,
[8530.46s -> 8532.14s]  you jump back and forth, jump into it.
[8533.32s -> 8535.16s]  Sometimes I play a game and I'll come back a week or two later
[8535.16s -> 8537.24s]  and it's just like, I don't even know who the fuck any of these people are.
[8538.04s -> 8539.00s]  It's very helpful.
[8539.00s -> 8540.12s]  Unironically, I mean it.
[8540.92s -> 8550.36s]  So, it wasn't about bears at all.
[8550.36s -> 8551.64s]  They, unironically again.
[8563.32s -> 8564.36s]  Everyone with a brand.
[8564.92s -> 8566.76s]  And then everyone without one and all.
[8567.00s -> 8571.56s]  And locked you in the cellar, hoping sooner or later someone would break.
[8577.55s -> 8582.19s]  You know, things might have been different if you'd accepted my invitation.
[8582.19s -> 8583.39s]  Oh, don't remind us.
[8583.39s -> 8584.99s]  We were all saying the same thing.
[8584.99s -> 8586.19s]  This is our own, isn't it?
[8586.99s -> 8588.99s]  Don't mean we won't help when we can, though.
[8588.99s -> 8590.91s]  And that, I'll drink to.
[8592.03s -> 8595.69s]  I just wish one of them would keep dying.
[8595.69s -> 8597.13s]  Yes, I'll drink to that.
[8597.13s -> 8597.61s]  Because like,
[8598.57s -> 8601.55s]  Let's do something weird.
[8602.11s -> 8602.59s]  Like, who?
[8608.57s -> 8609.85s]  But people still think it was cool.
[8636.11s -> 8642.59s]  13 years ago, I watched the dominant kill my brother right in front of me.
[8643.63s -> 8645.24s]  And I did nothing.
[8648.14s -> 8649.10s]  But now I can.
[8651.45s -> 8653.13s]  I can kill the son of a bitch.
[8654.67s -> 8657.55s]  And bring peace to my brother's soul.
[8659.92s -> 8663.79s]  After that, whatever happens, happens.
[8664.51s -> 8670.92s]  Wait, you're content to be a slave, then?
[8670.92s -> 8681.10s]  That's what I'm saying.
[8681.10s -> 8681.66s]  That's what I was...
[8682.70s -> 8683.82s]  Like, Sid, there's nothing in that cup.
[8684.62s -> 8685.58s]  Sid, there's nothing in there.
[8685.98s -> 8687.98s]  That cup has been empty for like, 40 minutes.
[8692.52s -> 8693.40s]  He did the thing!
[8693.40s -> 8697.48s]  This radiance would have us believe the Imperial host invincible.
[8699.45s -> 8705.85s]  Yet here we find the Empire's cornerstone teetering on the backs of a handful of cowards and cutthroats.
[8709.64s -> 8712.44s]  While the Hamid may lead a hundred full legions.
[8713.08s -> 8718.60s]  Could it be that the young prince defends a house of cards ready to topple at the slightest breeze?
[8718.60s -> 8720.12s]  But I recognize that guy's voice.
[8720.92s -> 8722.28s]  He's in Game of Thrones.
[8722.28s -> 8724.68s]  Pretty big part in Game of Thrones.
[8773.37s -> 8773.87s]  Ow!
[8774.49s -> 8775.45s]  That's not a good...
[8776.41s -> 8778.41s]  You're literally, like, hurting me.
[8778.41s -> 8779.13s]  Why would I do that?
[8795.58s -> 8797.26s]  Why didn't you want to make it seem like this...
[8797.26s -> 8798.06s]  What you were doing was like...
[8799.90s -> 8800.78s]  Like, hey, I'm gonna...
[8800.78s -> 8802.94s]  By the way, here's like a full steak dinner.
[8803.82s -> 8808.01s]  And, like, you know, you want one of these swords?
[8808.01s -> 8808.89s]  We can make one for you.
[8809.45s -> 8811.60s]  What's your favorite movie?
[8811.60s -> 8813.60s]  That we can get it on an emblem on the handle for you?
[8814.32s -> 8815.69s]  Or your favorite play?
[8815.69s -> 8816.33s]  Whatever.
[8816.33s -> 8817.61s]  You know, what's your favorite book?
[8827.23s -> 8829.15s]  Yeah, I get pulp fiction on the emblem.
[8829.15s -> 8829.71s]  It's like the...
[8857.13s -> 8861.21s]  It's freaking Gav.
[8863.13s -> 8864.57s]  I hope Gav is a party member.
[8866.01s -> 8866.57s]  What about Gav?
[8872.49s -> 8872.99s]  Aww.
[8876.33s -> 8876.97s]  I like Gav.
[8889.64s -> 8893.77s]  I suppose I better scout ahead for any surprises.
[8894.65s -> 8897.56s]  Don't you let him down.
[8898.36s -> 8901.61s]  I won't.
[8901.61s -> 8904.35s]  Wait, we're sending him ahead because he has a...
[8904.35s -> 8905.95s]  He can smell things better than us.
[8906.59s -> 8907.63s]  Not so fast.
[8908.27s -> 8909.71s]  We wait until tomorrow.
[8911.34s -> 8912.14s]  He's right there.
[8912.78s -> 8916.78s]  And if we leave now, we'll arrive just as the sun comes up.
[8916.78s -> 8918.94s]  Maybe join the guards in breaking their fast.
[8919.74s -> 8921.02s]  Come on, Clive.
[8921.02s -> 8922.56s]  They only just took the place.
[8923.12s -> 8924.72s]  They'll be there a while yet.
[8924.72s -> 8927.52s]  I bet you cannot name Gav's accent.
[8929.36s -> 8929.84s]  Welsh.
[8929.84s -> 8930.16s]  Thank you.
[8930.64s -> 8931.36s]  What were you going to give me?
[8932.16s -> 8932.40s]  No.
[8944.41s -> 8945.13s]  Even close.
[8945.77s -> 8948.56s]  Dude, I'm very precise.
[8949.20s -> 8955.61s]  Okay, cool.
[8957.36s -> 8958.00s]  New stock.
[8969.28s -> 8971.29s]  Let me upgrade first.
[8972.01s -> 8977.79s]  Is there a blacksmith here?
[8977.79s -> 8979.15s]  There's a shop, but...
[8982.78s -> 8988.32s]  What do you got?
[8988.32s -> 8989.92s]  What can I interest you in today?
[8990.64s -> 8993.68s]  Give the best voice of the entire video again.
[8994.24s -> 8996.09s]  Can I get you to talk more?
[8996.09s -> 8997.29s]  Like, way more?
[8997.29s -> 9000.49s]  What does that get you to talk 10 times more than you already have, Button?
[9003.20s -> 9004.59s]  I have the longsword.
[9005.55s -> 9006.43s]  I need potions.
[9007.23s -> 9008.43s]  Yeah, I'm kind of out of these.
[9009.53s -> 9010.41s]  These are expensive.
[9018.52s -> 9019.56s]  Ah, yes.
[9020.20s -> 9023.61s]  I hope it's to your liking.
[9025.47s -> 9026.67s]  I trust it's all here.
[9031.76s -> 9032.40s]  Okay.
[9032.40s -> 9033.36s]  I don't need more than this.
[9035.90s -> 9037.74s]  $40,000.
[9037.74s -> 9038.38s]  What is this?
[9040.99s -> 9045.44s]  Adds a new song to the hideaways orchestrion.
[9045.44s -> 9046.32s]  40 grand?
[9046.88s -> 9048.81s]  Oh, that's a gold sink right there.
[9049.93s -> 9050.41s]  Good day.
[9055.69s -> 9056.97s]  I have like 3,000.
[9057.53s -> 9060.72s]  Quentin, my good man.
[9060.72s -> 9062.16s]  It seems we'll be spending the night.
[9062.80s -> 9064.08s]  I thought as much.
[9064.64s -> 9067.45s]  Where do you find that one?
[9068.17s -> 9069.66s]  What, him?
[9069.66s -> 9071.18s]  You won't believe me if I told you.
[9073.84s -> 9079.04s]  Quentin here is an old friend, one who is sympathetic to our cause.
[9079.04s -> 9080.80s]  Grind forward, or we riot.
[9081.92s -> 9083.84s]  And he knows about your little sanctuary.
[9086.65s -> 9089.77s]  I would never have guessed so many people were bent on setting us free.
[9092.00s -> 9095.84s]  When last I checked, the mere thoughtward only would trip to the gallows.
[9097.63s -> 9101.55s]  I am well aware of the risks, as I am of the rewards.
[9105.26s -> 9108.30s]  And what could be more rewarding than your very own dominant of fire?
[9109.34s -> 9110.46s]  A dominant?
[9110.46s -> 9110.86s]  Here?
[9112.06s -> 9114.06s]  Now that I would like to see.
[9117.50s -> 9118.38s]  Meaning you haven't.
[9119.34s -> 9122.14s]  No, but nothing passes unnoticed in Lostwing.
[9122.14s -> 9123.98s]  Take your brand, for example.
[9131.63s -> 9134.43s]  People will see that at once.
[9136.08s -> 9140.56s]  And I need hardly tell you how they will greet the inquiries of a bearer.
[9142.22s -> 9147.10s]  You are afraid your words will fall on deaf ears.
[9148.46s -> 9152.70s]  As they have ever since the moment you were marked.
[9153.42s -> 9154.74s]  Okay.
[9158.86s -> 9163.02s]  Happily, I can provide a solution to your dilemma.
[9163.02s -> 9164.70s]  As a favor to Cid, that is.
[9170.12s -> 9171.00s]  Take this.
[9172.94s -> 9176.70s]  You will find it has the uncanny power to loosen tongues.
[9178.84s -> 9179.48s]  Seal.
[9179.48s -> 9182.04s]  You accept the hanged man from Quentin?
[9182.04s -> 9183.64s]  May the mothers guide you.
[9184.28s -> 9194.88s]  This might be Imperial land, but here in Lostwing, it's his word that's law.
[9195.60s -> 9196.32s]  But how?
[9197.66s -> 9199.82s]  You don't need to worry about that just yet.
[9199.82s -> 9200.32s]  Trust me.
[9200.94s -> 9203.34s]  Everyone in Lostwing knows what that seal means.
[9203.98s -> 9205.90s]  And what it means if they don't take note.
[9206.94s -> 9213.28s]  We can sit here counting our blessings or put them to good use and find that dominant.
[9213.92s -> 9214.48s]  Your choice.
[9215.84s -> 9220.32s]  Hey, I guess I'll use it for finding the dominant.
[9221.45s -> 9223.45s]  Let's see if this thing really works.
[9224.57s -> 9227.39s]  Gather information from the villagers.
[9227.39s -> 9227.89s]  Okay.
[9228.51s -> 9233.32s]  But is it to walk up to them and be like, hey, what do you know?
[9233.96s -> 9236.22s]  That's all you can do.
[9236.22s -> 9239.00s]  All right.
[9239.00s -> 9239.48s]  What do you know?
[9240.04s -> 9245.52s]  Master Quentin took a liking to you, I see.
[9246.24s -> 9248.64s]  And there I was thinking you were in bed with Cid.
[9249.36s -> 9251.12s]  Wonder what Gav will have to say about this.
[9251.84s -> 9253.95s]  Speaking of whom.
[9253.95s -> 9254.45s]  What?
[9255.07s -> 9255.71s]  You see him.
[9257.15s -> 9259.47s]  Tell him thanks for looking after us.
[9261.05s -> 9263.31s]  Now, what can I help you with?
[9264.11s -> 9265.95s]  I'm searching for a dominant of fire.
[9266.83s -> 9269.07s]  Gav seems to think he might have taken refuge here.
[9269.95s -> 9272.17s]  We see a lot of bearers around these parts.
[9273.13s -> 9276.30s]  But I do seem to recall one who commanded the flame.
[9276.94s -> 9279.90s]  Now whether or not that makes him a dominant, I can't say.
[9281.02s -> 9284.16s]  But the Waludas certainly took a keen interest in the poor sod.
[9284.80s -> 9285.68s]  Did you go look at him?
[9287.76s -> 9288.56s]  Didn't have a chance.
[9289.36s -> 9291.20s]  One of the other bearers might have died.
[9291.84s -> 9292.32s]  Thank you.
[9301.15s -> 9301.65s]  Okay.
[9303.13s -> 9303.77s]  I don't know.
[9308.88s -> 9309.44s]  What is this?
[9309.44s -> 9310.32s]  What is this crystal?
[9311.04s -> 9319.90s]  That thing's kind of cool.
[9323.63s -> 9324.19s]  Get over here.
[9324.19s -> 9324.69s]  I can't.
[9328.84s -> 9333.68s]  This is a genuine laugh.
[9334.24s -> 9345.73s]  What do you know?
[9347.55s -> 9349.07s]  About a hanged man, I see.
[9350.33s -> 9352.33s]  Master Quentin must think you're important.
[9352.89s -> 9354.41s]  It was a good thing you done today.
[9355.05s -> 9356.41s]  Getting rid of those bastards.
[9357.05s -> 9358.33s]  If you hadn't come when you did,
[9358.97s -> 9360.65s]  I'd be on my way to Ashby now.
[9361.61s -> 9362.49s]  Along with the others.
[9363.53s -> 9364.33s]  Poor buggers.
[9365.05s -> 9367.77s]  These others, was there a dominant among them?
[9367.77s -> 9369.05s]  A dominant of fire?
[9369.93s -> 9371.21s]  Might have been, yeah.
[9372.25s -> 9374.17s]  Royalists seem to think there was, anyhow.
[9374.17s -> 9374.57s]  You know what?
[9374.57s -> 9380.33s]  I'm in an NPC dialogue with another NPC
[9380.33s -> 9383.21s]  and that character was the playable character coming to kill me.
[9386.32s -> 9387.60s]  Only that you weren't alone.
[9388.32s -> 9390.40s]  Was a young maid who went wherever he did.
[9391.12s -> 9392.08s]  Including the church.
[9392.80s -> 9395.76s]  And wherever the royalists dragged them both off to before you got here.
[9396.32s -> 9396.80s]  I see.
[9397.68s -> 9398.16s]  Thank you.
[9398.72s -> 9402.12s]  I wonder if Sid's found anything.
[9402.12s -> 9403.80s]  I want to bite your head right now.
[9406.67s -> 9407.55s]  I can relax.
[9408.27s -> 9416.57s]  All right, speak with Sid.
[9417.37s -> 9435.52s]  All right, I got info.
[9435.52s -> 9437.68s]  Tell me that scowl means you've got good news.
[9441.16s -> 9441.66s]  Sorry.
[9447.15s -> 9447.71s]  It's all right.
[9447.71s -> 9448.27s]  It's all right.
[9448.27s -> 9449.07s]  A shady lad.
[9449.07s -> 9449.95s]  Just relax.
[9449.95s -> 9450.75s]  Just relax.
[9450.75s -> 9452.35s]  And it's equally shady lass.
[9453.15s -> 9454.27s]  Not much to go on.
[9454.99s -> 9455.49s]  But.
[9456.27s -> 9456.77s]  But.
[9458.24s -> 9459.12s]  I've been thinking.
[9459.68s -> 9461.44s]  If our friend is a dominant,
[9462.00s -> 9464.00s]  why not just burn the royalists to a crisp?
[9464.64s -> 9466.24s]  There's a reason he's holding back.
[9466.24s -> 9467.76s]  Burn the royalists to a crisp?
[9467.76s -> 9469.52s]  I reckon it has something to do with his partner.
[9469.52s -> 9471.84s]  That's such a horrible way to...
[9471.84s -> 9475.20s]  One of the villagers I talked to said the two were separated.
[9475.84s -> 9477.36s]  If the Waludas have her,
[9477.36s -> 9480.32s]  our dominants like to think twice before starting any fires.
[9480.96s -> 9483.92s]  Whoever he is, he's shown himself to have a level head.
[9484.64s -> 9487.92s]  He's careful, cunning, and he doesn't want to be found.
[9489.72s -> 9493.31s]  This could spell trouble for us and the royalists both.
[9496.16s -> 9496.66s]  Still.
[9497.36s -> 9501.12s]  It'll be a whole lot worse if we set off after them with bleary eyes and empty bellies.
[9501.68s -> 9504.16s]  There should be a pair of pallets waiting for us back at the inn.
[9505.04s -> 9505.54s]  Shall we?
[9506.80s -> 9507.44s]  Let's do it.
[9508.72s -> 9511.28s]  Your party makeup has changed.
[9520.60s -> 9532.78s]  How come you're not skipping?
[9532.78s -> 9533.28s]  I...
[9537.34s -> 9538.06s]  I forgot.
[9538.62s -> 9548.43s]  I seem to recall your request being to spend the night.
[9548.99s -> 9551.87s]  And for that, the floor will more than suffice.
[9552.67s -> 9554.59s]  Better than a wet rock, I suppose.
[9557.00s -> 9558.20s]  My thanks, Quentin.
[9559.00s -> 9561.88s]  Next time you're at the hideaway, our floor's all yours.
[9562.68s -> 9564.12s]  No need for thanks, Sid.
[9564.92s -> 9566.92s]  This isn't an act of charity.
[9567.64s -> 9568.68s]  You don't say.
[9568.68s -> 9569.72s]  I do like the voice work, though.
[9569.72s -> 9573.64s]  In exchange for my floor, I shall be requiring your services.
[9574.36s -> 9576.36s]  Even like, the side characters are great.
[9576.36s -> 9579.56s]  ...to barricade across the road south when they occupied the village.
[9580.28s -> 9582.36s]  And failed to remove it when they left.
[9583.08s -> 9585.08s]  I expect it to be gone before you leave.
[9585.96s -> 9586.76s]  As you wish.
[9600.33s -> 9601.29s]  Following evening.
[9601.29s -> 9602.25s]  Uh oh, we're not gonna get...
[9602.97s -> 9605.29s]  Well, that's all longer than expected.
[9606.33s -> 9608.09s]  First time dismantling a barricade?
[9608.65s -> 9609.45s]  It gets easier.
[9609.45s -> 9611.93s]  Dude wants a favor for letting somebody sleep on the floor?
[9612.89s -> 9616.17s]  If we leave now, we'll arrive at the care when the shadows are at the deepest.
[9616.17s -> 9616.89s]  Yeah, what the fuck?
[9616.89s -> 9617.61s]  Well, I should rather wait.
[9618.33s -> 9619.29s]  No more waiting.
[9620.09s -> 9624.24s]  The road's south end.
[9625.34s -> 9625.82s]  Unless...
[9626.62s -> 9627.82s]  I know of another shortcut.
[9628.80s -> 9629.84s]  You should be so lucky.
[9630.48s -> 9632.16s]  I have heels, right?
[9632.16s -> 9632.80s]  Yeah, I do.
[9632.80s -> 9633.84s]  I have a potion.
[9633.84s -> 9634.88s]  I have three?
[9635.76s -> 9637.60s]  Uh, the high potions over there?
[9638.40s -> 9648.72s]  Oh, yippee!
[9651.40s -> 9653.96s]  I'm gonna collect potions, and I'm gonna collect materials,
[9653.96s -> 9654.84s]  and I'm gonna get...
[9654.84s -> 9655.96s]  I'm gonna get status effects!
[9656.76s -> 9657.92s]  Just you wait!
[9657.92s -> 9658.72s]  Just you wait, Sid!
[9666.94s -> 9668.97s]  Everything all right?
[9669.69s -> 9679.21s]  Yup.
[9679.21s -> 9683.90s]  If the royalists were looking to take the care
[9683.90s -> 9687.02s]  that have posted centuries to prevent any unwelcome surprises,
[9687.66s -> 9688.70s]  at least I would have.
[9689.85s -> 9691.77s]  Well, you should know.
[9706.27s -> 9708.27s]  Make for Care Norvent.
[9712.00s -> 9712.64s]  Five bucks?
[9719.85s -> 9720.35s]  Let's go!
[9722.56s -> 9742.43s]  Wait.
[9743.29s -> 9746.14s]  I probably didn't even need to buy the potions now that I'm looking at it.
[9746.86s -> 9749.00s]  What are the royalists thinking?
[9749.00s -> 9751.87s]  Why take a stronghold they've no chance of holding?
[9752.59s -> 9754.35s]  When they've no intention of holding it,
[9755.15s -> 9757.32s]  the king is up to something.
[9758.12s -> 9758.62s]  The king?
[9759.24s -> 9761.71s]  Well, you don't think they're acting on a whim, do you?
[9762.81s -> 9765.37s]  This is one of his majesty's cunning stunts,
[9766.09s -> 9768.01s]  and he's sent his best to execute it.
[9769.45s -> 9769.95s]  Back over here.
[9770.89s -> 9771.39s]  Item.
[9778.57s -> 9780.89s]  Two pinches of magicked ash.
[9782.40s -> 9782.90s]  Ooh!
[9783.60s -> 9784.24s]  What is this?
[9785.84s -> 9787.39s]  This is like a super chest.
[9788.03s -> 9797.28s]  Did I get a lore check?
[9797.28s -> 9798.16s]  I had to shave.
[9798.16s -> 9798.66s]  Yeah.
[9801.20s -> 9803.04s]  We're going to Care Norvent.
[9803.60s -> 9806.08s]  It's an imperial stronghold located along the southern fringes
[9806.64s -> 9810.00s]  of Sambricoi's territory,
[9810.00s -> 9812.80s]  far from its capital of Oriflame.
[9814.17s -> 9815.21s]  Shatter was wondering.
[9815.21s -> 9818.17s]  It occupies a key strategic position adjacent to the Crystal Belt,
[9818.81s -> 9822.17s]  and it's suitably formatively fortified as a result.
[9822.17s -> 9823.93s]  Within its walls there are living quarters,
[9823.93s -> 9826.81s]  a church, a jail, and sufficient storehouses
[9826.81s -> 9829.29s]  to see the occupants through the lengthy siege.
[9829.29s -> 9830.17s]  Hope you had a good shave.
[9869.88s -> 9872.56s]  You're going to do another Halloween week this year?
[9872.56s -> 9873.44s]  Yeah, of course.
[9874.16s -> 9880.06s]  Play at least a few scary games.
[9880.06s -> 9881.18s]  There's quite a few that have come out.
[9888.80s -> 9891.12s]  All right, check over here.
[9891.84s -> 9899.00s]  Can't go this way?
[9899.64s -> 9900.14s]  No?
[9903.18s -> 9904.14s]  He won't do it now.
[9904.14s -> 9904.94s]  He just said he would.
[9904.94s -> 9905.66s]  Now he won't do it.
[9908.04s -> 9911.48s]  You should wear a cardigan again for Halloween week.
[9911.48s -> 9912.12s]  All right, hold on.
[9913.24s -> 9913.88s]  Getting attacked.
[9933.48s -> 9934.76s]  Oh, I should have jumped up there.
[9936.36s -> 9939.63s]  Level 14?
[9940.51s -> 9955.58s]  Can you do a minus two stream where you tell bad jokes on purpose?
[9957.34s -> 9959.80s]  We did that three days ago.
[9959.80s -> 9961.16s]  I feel like I do that every other stream.
[9965.76s -> 9969.36s]  My plan for Halloween this year is to get a full elaborate vampire outfit.
[9971.36s -> 9971.86s]  I'm doing that.
[9974.78s -> 9981.66s]  I'm going to be in character the whole night.
[9984.52s -> 9988.12s]  I'm going to pretend like it's 1100 or something.
[9989.00s -> 9990.68s]  When do vampires rain?
[9990.68s -> 9991.18s]  I don't remember.
[9993.72s -> 9994.52s]  Well, they didn't ever.
[9996.04s -> 9997.16s]  When are vampires supposed to exist?
[10012.80s -> 10014.16s]  Somebody said 2008.
[10046.03s -> 10047.23s]  Fourteen hundreds.
[10047.23s -> 10047.73s]  Okay.
[10064.06s -> 10065.66s]  Wear a cardigan as the vampire?
[10066.14s -> 10068.54s]  The best and worst decision I ever made.
[10068.54s -> 10073.77s]  Your estimator, Clive.
[10073.77s -> 10077.04s]  A fight with her icon is not one you're likely to walk away from.
[10077.98s -> 10082.06s]  Garuda, warden of the wind.
[10082.06s -> 10087.90s]  Yeah, I'll just drink like a bottle of wine on stream.
[10089.02s -> 10093.39s]  Let's play scary games.
[10107.23s -> 10108.03s]  New location.
[10116.72s -> 10122.12s]  I think this is that part in the demo.
[10122.12s -> 10122.84s]  Is that correct?
[10122.84s -> 10124.68s]  This seems like the place for it.
[10124.68s -> 10125.88s]  I think this is the part from the demo.
[10127.87s -> 10128.37s]  Yeah, it is.
[10145.70s -> 10146.98s]  The land has fallen.
[10150.13s -> 10152.93s]  The eastern territories all but belong to the orcs.
[10154.22s -> 10156.14s]  I'll have my men ready to depart by noon.
[10156.14s -> 10156.78s]  Don't bother.
[10157.74s -> 10159.76s]  But what of the mines?
[10159.76s -> 10163.04s]  Without Adamantite, the light would have engulfed the mines ere long.
[10164.32s -> 10167.52s]  Besides, you already have your orders.
[10169.79s -> 10171.15s]  Yes, my liege.
[10171.15s -> 10175.87s]  The dark swallows more of the realm with each passing day.
[10176.51s -> 10180.11s]  The land starved of the ether that gives it life.
[10180.11s -> 10186.19s]  And as the fringes fade, the people flock to the mother crystals desperate for their blessing.
[10187.15s -> 10190.64s]  For we wage for possession of that blessing.
[10191.52s -> 10196.16s]  It breaks us from within, hastening us to our own destruction.
[10196.72s -> 10199.84s]  And so you do what must be done.
[10201.07s -> 10206.11s]  I unite the dominance that we may bring an end to the strife
[10206.75s -> 10210.59s]  and found a new order to see us unto tomorrow.
[10210.59s -> 10216.38s]  The world must be restored and I will see it so.
[10216.38s -> 10219.10s]  You might have already had Sedolphus not betrayed us.
[10219.10s -> 10219.60s]  Last fight.
[10221.47s -> 10222.11s]  Him again.
[10223.07s -> 10224.99s]  Lost you still for his embrace.
[10226.51s -> 10229.34s]  But worse not.
[10230.70s -> 10231.58s]  My liege.
[10233.94s -> 10236.58s]  I serve you and you alone.
[10237.70s -> 10245.20s]  I remember well the day you first entered these halls.
[10247.86s -> 10252.26s]  Your pale hand pressed into his as if it would never let go.
[10252.26s -> 10255.58s]  That that was a long time ago.
[10256.78s -> 10261.02s]  Sometimes it's like, hey, man, you're going to like play Breath of the Wild like next week.
[10270.11s -> 10279.31s]  Soon my hand that is that keeps them from falling into the darkness.
[10280.62s -> 10281.74s]  Hold me, my liege.
[10282.62s -> 10283.58s]  Never let me go.
[10295.79s -> 10297.07s]  That scared the shit out of me.
[10297.07s -> 10300.75s]  Well, our sentries has failed to report, my lady, your orders.
[10300.75s -> 10303.15s]  Pull the men back inside their care, Geralt.
[10303.15s -> 10304.03s]  He is here, then.
[10305.06s -> 10308.10s]  Have them lead Sid and his little pet to the chapel.
[10308.74s -> 10310.34s]  I shall entertain them there.
[10318.59s -> 10320.19s]  So you've come for me after all.
[10323.15s -> 10324.03s]  Yes, I have.
[10328.27s -> 10329.79s]  Yeah, this is the demo part.
[10330.67s -> 10332.35s]  Well, the part of the extra demo.
[10346.05s -> 10347.25s]  Yep, this is the same part.
[10354.29s -> 10354.85s]  Headwind.
[10361.50s -> 10362.99s]  To teach me some time.
[10365.26s -> 10367.34s]  Oh, yeah, I forgot how do I turn this back on?
[10367.34s -> 10370.30s]  Remember, I had to turn the brightness up on my game because I didn't know how to turn it back on.
[10374.54s -> 10375.50s]  I was like, I can't see.
[10376.14s -> 10378.34s]  We should start with the dungeons.
[10378.34s -> 10386.26s]  Where is that?
[10386.26s -> 10388.48s]  Oh, yeah.
[10388.48s -> 10390.03s]  In here.
[10396.13s -> 10397.01s]  They're all empty.
[10398.11s -> 10400.34s]  And you're going to give up.
[10404.19s -> 10411.36s]  Sid, this gate needs some help.
[10412.70s -> 10414.54s]  We just cast a headache curse on me.
[10415.18s -> 10415.90s]  Let me help you here.
[10419.90s -> 10420.62s]  Should be gone now.
[10428.30s -> 10429.50s]  I did my I did my best.
[10429.50s -> 10438.14s]  You made it worse.
[10442.53s -> 10449.14s]  Oh, you just made me dumber.
[10451.78s -> 10452.66s]  No, you don't.
[10452.66s -> 10454.10s]  You can't even prove that, by the way.
[10454.10s -> 10454.82s]  Did you hear that?
[10455.38s -> 10456.74s]  What are you in the middle of a math test?
[10458.50s -> 10459.54s]  Now you just don't know how to do it.
[10466.80s -> 10467.30s]  Hi.
[10477.15s -> 10477.79s]  Kind of loud.
[10477.79s -> 10478.11s]  I know.
[10478.11s -> 10479.79s]  But I mean, you got to get pumped up, right?
[10479.79s -> 10480.75s]  You got to get pumped up.
[10493.82s -> 10494.78s]  Oh, that was cool.
[10502.40s -> 10503.76s]  Where to next?
[10506.37s -> 10506.85s]  I don't know.
[10506.85s -> 10507.49s]  Ask the dog.
[10509.95s -> 10510.59s]  Wait, let me check it.
[10510.59s -> 10512.91s]  I don't want to miss anything.
[10532.74s -> 10534.58s]  This door only leads to more Royalists.
[10535.30s -> 10535.86s]  We can take them.
[10535.86s -> 10536.58s]  Find another one.
[10536.58s -> 10537.14s]  We can take them.
[10538.93s -> 10539.73s]  Oh, snap.
[10539.73s -> 10542.61s]  It's the goofy guy I keep seeing on my YouTube feed.
[10546.88s -> 10547.76s]  Welcome to the stream.
[10548.40s -> 10555.07s]  Hope you enjoy your stay.
[10561.38s -> 10562.98s]  OK, now here's how I actually am.
[10581.82s -> 10584.43s]  Well, we found the Imperial garrison.
[10585.94s -> 10587.46s]  Right where the Royalists left.
[10587.70s -> 10678.26s]  I feel like I'm one of those living, like, AI paintings.
[10678.26s -> 10682.51s]  The ones that's like, oh, look, we can make grandpa blink.
[10682.51s -> 10683.47s]  You know what I mean?
[10683.47s -> 10702.78s]  The ones that are like, they're everywhere.
[10702.78s -> 10703.84s]  Let's go.
[10715.66s -> 10718.22s]  Get them all in the same zone.
[10718.22s -> 10719.02s]  Is it zero?
[10719.02s -> 10719.90s]  The same zero?
[10723.62s -> 10728.06s]  I think so.
[10735.15s -> 10735.65s]  You.
[10736.29s -> 10736.79s]  You.
[10737.01s -> 10737.65s]  You're the healer.
[10737.65s -> 10738.21s]  You need to die.
[10738.85s -> 10742.80s]  That was cool.
[10743.60s -> 10748.44s]  All right.
[10748.44s -> 10748.92s]  Can you heal me?
[10748.92s -> 10749.80s]  Because I don't want to use a potion.
[10750.44s -> 10756.04s]  I really don't want to use a potion.
[10756.04s -> 10756.44s]  I don't know.
[10756.44s -> 10756.92s]  Whatever.
[10756.92s -> 10757.48s]  I'll use them.
[10757.48s -> 10757.98s]  Fine.
[10768.15s -> 10775.43s]  Oh, bloody hide.
[10776.72s -> 10777.68s]  Bloody fangs.
[10787.08s -> 10788.36s]  Thanks for the...
[10824.50s -> 10825.46s]  Oh, shit.
[10826.26s -> 10839.76s]  And then one big one.
[10840.32s -> 10841.86s]  And then one of these.
[10843.22s -> 10844.09s]  There we go.
[10845.11s -> 10857.14s]  Oh, you went fast.
[10858.02s -> 10875.48s]  God damn it.
[10875.48s -> 10876.36s]  I keep forgetting he does that.
[10899.12s -> 10899.62s]  Kill.
[10900.32s -> 10902.12s]  All right.
[10902.12s -> 10903.08s]  I need to heal.
[10903.80s -> 10919.54s]  Would you consider yourself a junk food streamer?
[10919.54s -> 10920.74s]  Can you sing Billie Jean?
[10931.73s -> 10932.41s]  That one?
[10940.12s -> 10943.32s]  Oh, do Billie Jean without without any emotion at all?
[10943.32s -> 10943.82s]  Sure.
[10950.18s -> 10966.73s]  After them.
[10975.24s -> 10975.96s]  Well guarded.
[10975.96s -> 10979.08s]  Attacking the opponent from the front while his guarding will deal no damage.
[10979.08s -> 10980.82s]  Go to the back.
[10980.82s -> 10985.62s]  Hey, yeah, they can break through.
[10986.26s -> 10986.76s]  Yep.
[10988.28s -> 10988.78s]  Okay.
[11011.73s -> 11012.85s]  New enemies approach.
[11049.14s -> 11049.64s]  Four.
[11057.22s -> 11058.02s]  Caster, hold on.
[11081.28s -> 11082.16s]  I'm hungry.
[11082.16s -> 11082.80s]  Well, you should.
[11083.44s -> 11083.94s]  Get a snack.
[11092.26s -> 11093.14s]  You didn't even do the...
[11096.21s -> 11096.71s]  Now I did.
[11105.62s -> 11110.36s]  Don't miss a chest or anything.
[11110.36s -> 11110.84s]  I don't want to...
[11110.84s -> 11111.34s]  Yeah, see?
[11112.20s -> 11114.00s]  I don't want to miss anything.
[11121.81s -> 11122.85s]  I got some pizza here.
[11122.85s -> 11123.57s]  You want a slice?
[11124.21s -> 11124.93s]  Oh, I'm good.
[11125.57s -> 11127.59s]  What kind of pizza though is it?
[11128.23s -> 11128.73s]  Pepperoni?
[11143.53s -> 11154.18s]  What the hell?
[11154.18s -> 11156.34s]  A little late for prayer, isn't it?
[11156.34s -> 11162.07s]  Do I seem so desperate as to grovel at the feet of a false god?
[11162.07s -> 11164.31s]  This is gonna be much harder because I don't have all the things...
[11164.31s -> 11166.07s]  I was waiting for you.
[11166.07s -> 11167.35s]  All the accessories were on last time.
[11167.35s -> 11168.15s]  For too long, I hope.
[11170.76s -> 11172.36s]  All this for a midnight chat?
[11175.06s -> 11176.82s]  Well, let's chat then.
[11177.64s -> 11179.72s]  Where are the men and women you took from Lostwing?
[11180.28s -> 11181.80s]  You mean where's the dominant?
[11182.52s -> 11185.16s]  Well, Luke shall be requiring his services indefinitely.
[11186.74s -> 11188.90s]  Come back to me, Sedulphus.
[11188.90s -> 11189.62s]  I need you.
[11190.18s -> 11192.50s]  Think of all the things we can create together.
[11194.12s -> 11195.88s]  The world that we can build.
[11196.60s -> 11197.72s]  You need me?
[11199.66s -> 11201.42s]  Your king needs me.
[11201.42s -> 11203.18s]  I'm all for building a new world.
[11204.22s -> 11205.18s]  Just not his.
[11205.98s -> 11209.58s]  That bastard's dreams are as twisted as his promises are false.
[11210.38s -> 11212.38s]  And I want no part of him.
[11212.38s -> 11216.38s]  King Barnabas saved you, and this is how you speak of him.
[11216.46s -> 11218.14s]  Have you no shred of loyalty?
[11219.56s -> 11220.62s]  What?
[11220.62s -> 11222.14s]  To a leader who'd use me?
[11223.48s -> 11224.60s]  Like he uses you?
[11225.56s -> 11227.96s]  You know nothing of me, Sedulphus.
[11227.96s -> 11228.52s]  You're right.
[11229.64s -> 11233.18s]  I don't know who you are anymore, or what you want.
[11235.66s -> 11237.42s]  I only know what you used to say.
[11239.13s -> 11240.65s]  That you were tired of running.
[11242.65s -> 11244.89s]  That you just wanted to be free.
[11244.89s -> 11245.69s]  Free of it all.
[11247.02s -> 11248.94s]  You weren't lying to me then, so what changed?
[11250.42s -> 11253.38s]  What made you think you had to sacrifice who you were
[11253.38s -> 11254.50s]  to get what you wanted?
[11255.88s -> 11256.68s]  Sacrifice?
[11257.32s -> 11259.40s]  I used my talent to my advantage,
[11259.40s -> 11261.32s]  and you would tell me there is shame in that?
[11261.32s -> 11265.64s]  If there's no shame, then why do you feel so sorry for yourself?
[11265.64s -> 11267.64s]  Arousing speech, Lord Commander.
[11268.52s -> 11271.08s]  I was a fool to believe you might have changed.
[11272.04s -> 11275.00s]  The only person I feel sorry for is you!
[11277.96s -> 11279.32s]  I can't do this anymore.
[11286.07s -> 11289.35s]  If you would stand between our leash and his dream,
[11290.58s -> 11292.10s]  then you leave me no choice.
[11294.07s -> 11294.95s]  You're gonna do about it.
[11294.95s -> 11295.91s]  Goodbye, Sedulphus.
[11308.09s -> 11308.49s]  I'm back.
[11308.49s -> 11309.61s]  Did I miss anything?
[11309.61s -> 11340.89s]  And don't forget about what I can do.
[11341.61s -> 11342.89s]  I can get rid of your headaches.
[11345.86s -> 11346.66s]  Keep going, Sid!
[11347.30s -> 11350.90s]  I'll make sure you're clean of all pain in your upper region.
[11351.70s -> 11355.66s]  You are gonna wake up with fresh tomorrow.
[11356.46s -> 11370.49s]  Head's not gonna hurt.
[11370.49s -> 11384.31s]  I'm just the migraine medicine guy.
[11384.31s -> 11385.35s]  I don't want any part of this.
[11385.99s -> 11386.63s]  Finish them.
[11387.19s -> 11389.78s]  I don't even know how to use a sword.
[11389.86s -> 11390.34s]  I, uh...
[11395.56s -> 11399.00s]  Well, Sid, the beast is not three against one.
[11411.61s -> 11412.17s]  Watch out.
[11446.38s -> 11447.58s]  Cinematic evasion.
[11448.30s -> 11455.08s]  Oh, they crashed into each other.
[11455.08s -> 11456.20s]  I didn't even pick that up last time.
[11462.66s -> 11463.22s]  Get in here!
[11463.78s -> 11503.54s]  All right, this one's done.
[11524.23s -> 11524.73s]  Shit!
[11525.35s -> 11525.85s]  Sorry.
[11528.50s -> 11529.62s]  Okay, I'm getting hurt.
[11534.36s -> 11534.86s]  Shit.
[11573.72s -> 11574.84s]  8K, that's not bad.
[11586.44s -> 11586.94s]  Shit.
[11587.58s -> 11612.04s]  How come you look really interesting today?
[11612.04s -> 11612.92s]  I think it's just...
[11612.92s -> 11622.59s]  I have a beard I haven't shaved.
[11622.59s -> 11624.19s]  Mom instincts kicked in?
[11629.69s -> 11630.81s]  Mom instincts?
[11631.61s -> 11648.04s]  We're not done.
[11652.24s -> 11652.74s]  Sid.
[11655.69s -> 11656.57s]  Do I look all right?
[11659.20s -> 11669.60s]  Does he actually make it?
[11669.60s -> 11673.07s]  I mean, in the demo, doesn't it kind of just end?
[11673.07s -> 11677.52s]  Benedict II will be on her way to collect the Domain if she hasn't already.
[11680.20s -> 11681.96s]  You can't afford to let them leave.
[11682.52s -> 11684.60s]  Remember, she has wings, you don't.
[11685.56s -> 11686.20s]  What about you?
[11687.66s -> 11689.18s]  Before or after I catch my breath?
[11690.59s -> 11691.09s]  Sorry.
[11696.78s -> 11697.50s]  Come on, Toggle.
[11698.46s -> 11708.84s]  Oh, he is...
[11708.84s -> 11710.04s]  Yeah, he is there at the end of the demo.
[11712.57s -> 11715.80s]  Okay, let's keep going.
[11727.28s -> 11728.00s]  Give him a potion?
[11728.56s -> 11729.20s]  Oh, they're mine.
[11730.60s -> 11737.90s]  He had a lot of opportunities to go to the store and buy three high potions just like I did.
[11738.70s -> 11740.30s]  Wait, they might be just over here.
[11740.94s -> 11753.72s]  She must be here somewhere.
[11755.32s -> 11767.26s]  Yeah, I'll just throw this over at the favor of fire.
[11767.26s -> 11767.82s]  What was that?
[11768.70s -> 11774.49s]  Did I just get something?
[11774.49s -> 11783.15s]  What was that?
[11783.15s -> 11796.27s]  Oh, forget about the defense.
[11796.27s -> 11805.60s]  Let's put these both on.
[11805.60s -> 11806.96s]  I'm going to open the other door that was down here.
[11807.52s -> 11815.16s]  Can you equip the dog too?
[11815.16s -> 11817.32s]  I don't believe so.
[11817.96s -> 11818.68s]  I don't believe so.
[11819.24s -> 11820.36s]  At least not at the moment.
[11820.36s -> 11821.16s]  I'm not sure maybe later.
[11830.33s -> 11830.73s]  Good.
[11830.73s -> 11831.23s]  Meteorite.
[11837.76s -> 11841.36s]  We want to go this way.
[11841.36s -> 11842.56s]  You need to equip Otto.
[11859.90s -> 11862.70s]  Kind of sounded like Homer Simpson, didn't it?
[11864.14s -> 11865.10s]  For like one second.
[11866.22s -> 11875.66s]  I need to get rid of you.
[11885.47s -> 11886.03s]  You too.
[11886.03s -> 11886.59s]  You need to die.
[11916.86s -> 11917.34s]  Good dog.
[11918.20s -> 11922.27s]  Any more Cheshire Trests?
[11922.27s -> 11939.44s]  How do I get over there?
[11940.00s -> 11942.75s]  How do I get over there?
[11945.40s -> 11950.96s]  How do I get over there?
[11960.22s -> 11962.14s]  How lazy wants us gone before sunrise?
[11988.92s -> 11990.12s]  Oh, this is okay.
[11990.12s -> 11991.08s]  You go down from here.
[11991.72s -> 12000.43s]  Is there anywhere else to go?
[12003.52s -> 12004.56s]  I don't think so.
[12005.28s -> 12007.29s]  Can you pronounce something funny?
[12007.29s -> 12007.85s]  Give me a word.
[12008.65s -> 12009.53s]  Give me a word to pronounce.
[12028.54s -> 12029.42s]  Lobster.
[12029.42s -> 12030.00s]  There you go.
[12033.98s -> 12034.86s]  Oh, hold on.
[12037.98s -> 12039.82s]  All right, get everybody near the table.
[12040.70s -> 12042.33s]  I didn't hit anybody.
[12042.89s -> 12050.04s]  Oh, you got a good one.
[12050.84s -> 12058.44s]  Shit.
[12080.57s -> 12094.38s]  Oh, my hair's getting in the way.
[12095.10s -> 12102.06s]  Starting to like this game more and more.
[12103.26s -> 12105.28s]  It's just it's fun to play.
[12105.28s -> 12106.16s]  It's fun to play.
[12106.96s -> 12109.98s]  My mom made macaroni and cheese.
[12111.02s -> 12111.52s]  Pog.
[12112.30s -> 12124.83s]  This won't be easy.
[12125.63s -> 12128.56s]  Get him.
[12128.56s -> 12134.00s]  That fire breathing gets me a little like.
[12135.68s -> 12215.64s]  It's the first video game you ever played.
[12216.68s -> 12218.36s]  Super Mario Brothers for the NES.
[12220.73s -> 12222.09s]  Super Mario Brothers for the NES.
[12222.65s -> 12225.79s]  First game I really ever played.
[12225.79s -> 12228.83s]  Same, yeah.
[12230.60s -> 12231.48s]  I remember because.
[12232.60s -> 12236.12s]  So me and my siblings would play and we were terrible at it.
[12236.12s -> 12237.64s]  You've heard this story before.
[12237.64s -> 12238.60s]  That's lame.
[12238.60s -> 12241.24s]  All right, time that person up for fucking six weeks.
[12241.88s -> 12245.15s]  All right, so I've told the story before.
[12245.71s -> 12247.39s]  So siblings and I would.
[12248.27s -> 12250.99s]  So my dad would be like, all you got to do.
[12251.95s -> 12255.95s]  You just get to Bowser with five lives and I'll beat it.
[12256.59s -> 12258.35s]  He's like, as long as you get to the end of the game.
[12258.35s -> 12260.59s]  As long as you get to Bowser with at least five lives, I'll beat it.
[12261.45s -> 12264.97s]  And we would be desperately just trying to get to the end of the game with five lives.
[12264.97s -> 12266.65s]  Because we couldn't beat Bowser, but he could.
[12269.60s -> 12271.92s]  And he'd be like, Dad, Dad, we got six lives.
[12271.92s -> 12274.08s]  And he'd be like, all right, let me get in there.
[12275.04s -> 12278.32s]  And he'd die like five times in a row, but he would actually do it.
[12278.32s -> 12279.28s]  He would do it every time.
[12280.00s -> 12283.29s]  Good memories.
[12286.72s -> 12292.57s]  Because my dad knew that if we didn't have at least four or five lives.
[12294.33s -> 12297.10s]  Oh, I don't know if he's confident on doing it.
[12315.47s -> 12317.07s]  Oh, get your dad.
[12317.79s -> 12321.98s]  Yeah, we'd be cheering.
[12321.98s -> 12324.06s]  It'd be like, yeah, he did it.
[12324.06s -> 12325.18s]  He beat Bowser.
[12325.18s -> 12326.30s]  And he would just be like, that's right.
[12327.02s -> 12332.49s]  Okay, I'm going to pay attention.
[12332.49s -> 12337.56s]  What door did I knock on?
[12337.56s -> 12339.80s]  I just opened like five doors and I don't know where I'm going.
[12340.44s -> 12342.84s]  Okay, it's this one.
[12342.84s -> 12359.84s]  What are you going to do?
[12363.18s -> 12376.01s]  You coming?
[12376.01s -> 12389.48s]  How's the job going?
[12390.20s -> 12391.32s]  Start with off brand.
[12391.32s -> 12392.52s]  It's going awesome.
[12392.76s -> 12395.00s]  I'm starting to work on some projects.
[12395.00s -> 12397.40s]  I'm going to get some, you know, writing days in.
[12398.20s -> 12398.84s]  It's going great.
[12398.84s -> 12399.88s]  I'm really, really happy.
[12400.60s -> 12406.62s]  Trying to get the workflow, you know, different days that I'm going to be doing stuff and
[12407.66s -> 12409.90s]  meetings, meetings, meetings.
[12410.54s -> 12412.97s]  Is Ludwig a good boss?
[12412.97s -> 12416.17s]  Oh, yeah, I would say Ludwig is a great boss.
[12416.81s -> 12431.76s]  I confess I expected more from the old man and less from you.
[12431.76s -> 12434.64s]  This is the second time you've bested my sisters.
[12436.40s -> 12438.48s]  Men of your talents are rare indeed.
[12438.48s -> 12439.44s]  Did you get a new planner?
[12439.44s -> 12441.92s]  Why waste your lot with such undesirables?
[12441.92s -> 12447.36s]  If it is the hearth you long for, you will find more than enough warmth under my wings.
[12449.24s -> 12450.68s]  You know exactly what I want.
[12452.36s -> 12455.16s]  Hand over the dominant and I'll leave you in peace.
[12456.28s -> 12458.76s]  You would dare to make demands of me?
[12459.96s -> 12462.94s]  Know your place, little lamb.
[12464.46s -> 12468.14s]  Fool is the shepherd who heats every bleat of the flock.
[12469.85s -> 12472.89s]  And I will suffer yours no longer.
[12475.61s -> 12477.13s]  Must I spell it out for you?
[12477.13s -> 12482.25s]  See how the chief creative officer of off-brand does in this boss battle.
[12484.17s -> 12489.80s]  To the slaughter with you.
[12491.16s -> 12492.04s]  You brought it up.
[12492.04s -> 12492.68s]  I'm just.
[12494.60s -> 12495.56s]  Let's go.
[12496.28s -> 12517.76s]  That hurt a lot.
[12552.94s -> 12553.82s]  Oh, I don't have anything.
[12555.53s -> 12556.03s]  Yeah.
[12594.75s -> 12595.47s]  Headache on.
[12619.95s -> 12634.01s]  Cry all you.
[12634.01s -> 12637.74s]  There's no one to save you now.
[12643.98s -> 12671.24s]  Oh, it hurt.
[12671.24s -> 12688.88s]  Just charge it, charge it, charge it.
[12689.52s -> 12698.13s]  This time.
[12713.36s -> 12713.86s]  Shit.
[12731.90s -> 12732.40s]  Hold up.
[12733.02s -> 12739.15s]  3k, that's nothing.
[12739.95s -> 12771.45s]  Ram will fall.
[12774.41s -> 12777.00s]  I always press the L1.
[12782.19s -> 12793.82s]  Oh, go.
[12839.61s -> 12840.41s]  Oh, shit.
[12840.41s -> 12841.05s]  What does this mean?
[12901.53s -> 12902.57s]  Deadly embrace.
[12905.85s -> 12908.97s]  I will say it's much more difficult without the accessories on.
[12909.69s -> 12918.40s]  Come on, dog.
[12919.04s -> 12927.26s]  Get her.
[12936.56s -> 12956.82s]  Go.
[13008.67s -> 13009.95s]  Get her, Torgo.
[13009.95s -> 13010.45s]  Get her.
[13011.77s -> 13012.81s]  Shit, I'm in a combo.
[13013.77s -> 13037.47s]  Okay, we're good.
[13038.43s -> 13046.00s]  I thought it was crazy.
[13053.72s -> 13054.92s]  So this is as far as we've seen.
[13076.76s -> 13077.56s]  What's the difficulty?
[13078.76s -> 13079.48s]  The action.
[13079.48s -> 13080.44s]  There's two difficulties.
[13081.24s -> 13082.92s]  This story and action.
[13082.92s -> 13084.28s]  We've played your games.
[13084.92s -> 13086.11s]  I'm on action.
[13086.11s -> 13087.87s]  Tell me where he is.
[13091.31s -> 13091.81s]  Where are you?
[13106.81s -> 13109.37s]  What are you doing?
[13110.01s -> 13138.12s]  Why, why did you do that?
[13153.16s -> 13165.79s]  What the fuck?
[13165.79s -> 13166.59s]  Enough of this.
[13169.79s -> 13171.23s]  Oh.
[13176.19s -> 13176.91s]  I took it.
[13180.38s -> 13182.70s]  Now you really are only useful with birthday parties.
[13186.30s -> 13187.26s]  She's gone.
[13187.26s -> 13201.82s]  Give her back.
[13205.84s -> 13210.99s]  Or is she?
[13212.09s -> 13213.13s]  Where is Garuda?
[13219.44s -> 13221.71s]  Have you done?
[13221.71s -> 13225.92s]  Did you hear?
[13227.36s -> 13234.91s]  What the hell is going on?
[13247.20s -> 13247.92s]  Her power.
[13249.55s -> 13250.91s]  You took it from her.
[13251.55s -> 13253.42s]  How'd you do that?
[13253.42s -> 13254.46s]  And I'll take yours too.
[13256.40s -> 13257.52s]  You don't cut the shit.
[13258.94s -> 13261.18s]  That magical purple electricity.
[13261.18s -> 13263.16s]  I hope the bearers found a way out.
[13263.16s -> 13263.88s]  Looked cool.
[13264.68s -> 13269.07s]  This place is ready to collapse.
[13271.60s -> 13274.12s]  If your dominance started this fire,
[13274.12s -> 13275.16s]  and I'm betting he did.
[13279.66s -> 13284.73s]  What the hell is going on?
[13285.53s -> 13287.26s]  I thought that was us for a second.
[13288.22s -> 13289.34s]  We did not make it.
[13289.34s -> 13290.14s]  We didn't make it.
[13291.32s -> 13292.60s]  Oh boy, that's bad.
[13293.48s -> 13295.80s]  That's a bad thing for us to cut into being killed.
[13296.44s -> 13299.82s]  What was that?
[13299.82s -> 13305.45s]  I created a diversion as commanded, your grace.
[13306.01s -> 13308.62s]  The villagers escaped in the confusion.
[13308.62s -> 13310.73s]  As should we.
[13311.53s -> 13312.41s]  Yes.
[13312.41s -> 13317.90s]  Cutscene isn't over.
[13317.90s -> 13318.94s]  Basecam boy.
[13328.28s -> 13354.11s]  Yeah, I could do some upgrades.
[13354.11s -> 13354.91s]  I have a lot of points.
[13354.91s -> 13355.47s]  Come on.
[13355.47s -> 13357.76s]  If the catcher's leaving a burning care,
[13357.76s -> 13361.15s]  people might jump to conclusions.
[13361.15s -> 13365.37s]  Right.
[13365.37s -> 13366.41s]  Wings of change.
[13370.83s -> 13372.75s]  How can we remove basecam for cutscenes?
[13373.39s -> 13374.83s]  It makes it easier to pay attention to.
[13375.47s -> 13379.31s]  So you don't watch me pull boogers out of my nose and sneeze and stuff.
[13379.95s -> 13382.73s]  The power of wind.
[13382.73s -> 13386.57s]  Clive has claimed a portion of the icon Garuda's Essence.
[13386.57s -> 13390.81s]  Tuning with Garuda not only changes the elemental aspect of Clive's magic spells,
[13390.81s -> 13393.77s]  but also allows access to several new iconic abilities,
[13393.77s -> 13397.37s]  such as Gouge, a deadly flurry of talons
[13397.37s -> 13400.81s]  that can tear into an opponent for multiple hits.
[13400.81s -> 13404.22s]  Ability details can be found in the abilities tab in the main menu.
[13404.22s -> 13406.16s]  Garuda's Feet.
[13406.16s -> 13408.72s]  Garuda's iconic feat, Deadly Embrace,
[13408.72s -> 13412.56s]  can be used to draw smaller, lighter enemies toward Clive.
[13412.56s -> 13416.22s]  The action can also topple larger enemies and that, you know,
[13416.22s -> 13419.82s]  become partially staggered when their will gauge reaches 50%.
[13420.70s -> 13424.27s]  Toppling an enemy in this manner can deal significant damage.
[13424.27s -> 13425.87s]  So use it wisely.
[13425.87s -> 13428.04s]  This is called Deadly Embrace.
[13428.92s -> 13441.80s]  By the way, press L2 to cycle between currently attuned icons in real time,
[13441.80s -> 13444.38s]  allowing for more varied assault.
[13444.38s -> 13448.16s]  Cool down times for iconic abilities are displayed around the corresponding icon
[13448.16s -> 13449.68s]  in the ability widget.
[13449.68s -> 13452.64s]  Ability availability for all attuned icons can be confirmed.
[13452.64s -> 13456.44s]  Let me go like this.
[13458.04s -> 13465.92s]  So I have Deadly Embrace as this like hole.
[13465.92s -> 13466.96s]  I can feel it.
[13466.96s -> 13468.68s]  Okay, I'm back.
[13469.24s -> 13472.30s]  Inside me, the flames.
[13472.30s -> 13473.42s]  Gouge and Wicked Wheel.
[13474.38s -> 13478.44s]  Of course I want to try it out.
[13478.44s -> 13483.68s]  Of course I want to try it out.
[13483.68s -> 13484.56s]  Let's try it on these people.
[13516.64s -> 13517.52s]  Pretty cool.
[13529.12s -> 13530.30s]  Come here!
[13532.11s -> 13555.76s]  What do you got?
[13556.30s -> 13557.10s]  That's not going to help you.
[13558.06s -> 13563.58s]  Hey, I think you'd like the Final Fantasy 16 battle theme.
[13563.58s -> 13568.54s]  I think so.
[13569.18s -> 13580.24s]  Thank God you have CC now.
[13582.04s -> 13582.68s]  It's helpful.
[13583.48s -> 13584.28s]  The pole is helpful.
[13588.00s -> 13595.68s]  All right, we got a big dragon thing here.
[13598.06s -> 13618.72s]  Oh my goodness.
[13618.72s -> 13619.76s]  Oh my God, I forgot how to play.
[13620.56s -> 13639.55s]  What is the actual just default magic with this leg?
[13640.11s -> 13640.61s]  Pretty cool.
[13662.43s -> 13668.03s]  7K.
[13668.99s -> 13689.49s]  You watch the Smurfs movie yet?
[13689.49s -> 13691.38s]  Nope, I will.
[13691.38s -> 13692.42s]  I will this weekend.
[13692.42s -> 13698.67s]  You have Lego hair?
[13698.67s -> 13699.07s]  That's fine.
[13699.63s -> 13702.27s]  I don't want to move it because it'll...
[13707.02s -> 13707.66s]  I don't want to touch it.
[13708.22s -> 13709.98s]  If I touch it, I screwed up.
[13709.98s -> 13714.30s]  I need to go upgrade my weapon.
[13714.86s -> 13721.18s]  I have materials to upgrade this.
[13721.74s -> 13728.59s]  Don't just avoid all the items.
[13728.59s -> 13736.18s]  Five bucks.
[13739.44s -> 13742.53s]  Okay, let's take a look.
[13742.53s -> 13743.17s]  Abilities.
[13744.13s -> 13746.21s]  Garuda Channeled.
[13746.85s -> 13751.23s]  All right, this is where I got to figure out what I want to do.
[13751.79s -> 13756.51s]  Because there's at least three plus icons in the game.
[13756.51s -> 13762.24s]  There's at least three.
[13762.24s -> 13762.96s]  What is this one?
[13767.36s -> 13767.84s]  I don't know.
[13769.92s -> 13771.04s]  I like the pole.
[13777.73s -> 13779.09s]  I like the slashes.
[13779.09s -> 13779.73s]  It's gouged.
[13789.06s -> 13793.58s]  This is good too.
[13793.58s -> 13797.57s]  What's down here?
[13797.57s -> 13801.38s]  I use this a lot.
[13801.38s -> 13803.71s]  I use this a lot.
[13803.71s -> 13806.26s]  I use this a lot.
[13806.26s -> 13812.29s]  I use this a lot.
[13812.29s -> 13815.46s]  Does the pole just upgrade the damage?
[13815.46s -> 13816.50s]  Ah, that's a good question.
[13820.37s -> 13824.82s]  Range.
[13824.82s -> 13830.46s]  Looks like range?
[13830.46s -> 13831.66s]  Range is pretty good.
[13831.66s -> 13833.26s]  I'll go with this.
[13833.26s -> 13833.90s]  I like this one.
[13838.30s -> 13839.42s]  Follow up strike speed.
[13847.60s -> 13849.52s]  Jump back then deliver a punishing counter.
[13849.52s -> 13852.88s]  If the jump evades an attack, counter potency is increased.
[13852.88s -> 13861.60s]  So is this just a regular dodge?
[13862.16s -> 13863.28s]  But backwards and then I press...
[13863.84s -> 13865.12s]  How do I do the move?
[13865.12s -> 13866.99s]  Or is it a new move?
[13866.99s -> 13872.94s]  I'm upgrading this.
[13872.94s -> 13873.66s]  I use it all the time.
[13881.90s -> 13887.34s]  All right, what do I got?
[13887.34s -> 13893.28s]  Is it a different ability?
[13899.07s -> 13899.63s]  It is.
[13899.63s -> 13906.40s]  Okay, I would probably replace this.
[13906.40s -> 13911.87s]  So I really want to try to evade with this thing.
[13912.51s -> 13915.42s]  So you want to go wham.
[13916.22s -> 13918.62s]  And if you get a perfect evade, it's way better.
[13918.62s -> 13920.24s]  What's the cooldown?
[13921.04s -> 13924.82s]  Hmm is very pretty.
[13924.82s -> 13925.54s]  It is very pretty.
[13926.10s -> 13934.48s]  I want to practice that move.
[13934.48s -> 13938.02s]  Cool stream.
[13938.02s -> 13939.38s]  You can use this in IRL.
[13945.26s -> 13946.14s]  Wait, Gav is here.
[13958.51s -> 13965.39s]  I didn't know Gav was going to show up.
[13966.03s -> 13968.67s]  I'm not going to...
[13968.67s -> 13969.71s]  I'm going to stop talking.
[13974.24s -> 13974.88s]  Who was it?
[13975.68s -> 13976.88s]  Good question.
[13976.88s -> 13978.32s]  Someone who didn't have their hands full
[13978.32s -> 13979.92s]  fighting a bloody harpy, I guess.
[13981.12s -> 13983.82s]  But what matters is they're safe.
[13984.78s -> 13987.74s]  Something they wouldn't be had it not been for you, Gav.
[13989.82s -> 13991.58s]  Just doing my job like.
[13992.38s -> 13995.65s]  So what about his dominant?
[13996.29s -> 13996.79s]  Gone.
[13997.41s -> 13998.77s]  And after we were so close.
[13999.33s -> 14003.31s]  I can track him.
[14004.43s -> 14005.88s]  Who are you?
[14006.82s -> 14008.90s]  Sir told us about your family.
[14009.86s -> 14012.54s]  Lost mewing to imperial steel.
[14013.42s -> 14015.82s]  Sometimes vengeance is the only thing that keeps you going.
[14015.82s -> 14017.18s]  I'm biting my lip off camera.
[14017.18s -> 14017.68s]  I know.
[14018.30s -> 14019.66s]  You would be scolding me if you knew it.
[14019.66s -> 14020.70s]  Go safely, brothers.
[14021.82s -> 14026.16s]  Raggedy likes you.
[14027.04s -> 14038.48s]  She's gone.
[14039.04s -> 14039.98s]  She's gone.
[14040.54s -> 14043.30s]  My lady, you have to hold on.
[14043.30s -> 14043.94s]  We're going to get you.
[14043.94s -> 14044.66s]  Gone, gone, gone, gone.
[14045.70s -> 14050.34s]  What am I going to do?
[14054.78s -> 14056.30s]  How long to the coastal road?
[14057.18s -> 14059.18s]  At this pace, we won't make it by sunset.
[14060.14s -> 14063.34s]  No, he'll cost me up like all the others.
[14064.46s -> 14065.71s]  What am I going to do?
[14066.59s -> 14067.55s]  What am I going to do?
[14067.55s -> 14068.03s]  My lady.
[14068.03s -> 14068.91s]  Just pretend you still have it.
[14069.47s -> 14071.07s]  Oh, my God.
[14071.07s -> 14072.03s]  What the fuck?
[14074.69s -> 14080.46s]  I was waiting to see what that guy's story was,
[14080.46s -> 14081.74s]  but we're not going to get it anymore.
[14082.70s -> 14093.15s]  I thought that was going to be a major boss battle,
[14093.15s -> 14094.03s]  but no, he's just gone.
[14094.03s -> 14094.75s]  What are we out here?
[14094.75s -> 14095.25s]  Goodbye.
[14095.25s -> 14099.74s]  Thank you.
[14099.74s -> 14101.38s]  Jerov.
[14101.38s -> 14105.22s]  Second in command of Wayload's Royal Intelligencers.
[14105.30s -> 14107.55s]  Serving under Benedicta Harmon.
[14107.55s -> 14110.91s]  Killed by footpads while attempting to evacuate
[14110.91s -> 14114.91s]  the stricken Benedicta from the collapsing we just got.
[14114.91s -> 14118.86s]  This is just what happened to him right now.
[14118.86s -> 14120.14s]  This is the eulogy.
[14121.71s -> 14130.46s]  This is like the two sentence of what just happened to this guy.
[14130.46s -> 14131.98s]  Wiki page updated.
[14131.98s -> 14133.02s]  That's so funny.
[14138.38s -> 14139.26s]  What does this one say?
[14141.36s -> 14143.57s]  Huh?
[14143.57s -> 14149.52s]  No more powers.
[14149.52s -> 14152.40s]  Her love for former Lord Commander Sid
[14152.40s -> 14155.60s]  was deep and true and left an equally abyssal hole
[14155.60s -> 14160.38s]  in her heart when he fled Wayload.
[14160.38s -> 14161.66s]  Just pretend you still have the powers.
[14163.34s -> 14164.22s]  Who's going to question you?
[14164.22s -> 14166.94s]  We'll be doing the slavers of this service
[14166.94s -> 14169.74s]  if we didn't appraise our worth.
[14170.86s -> 14171.42s]  Stay away.
[14190.69s -> 14191.33s]  It's all right.
[14193.17s -> 14194.85s]  They can't hurt you anymore.
[14194.85s -> 14206.27s]  Let's go home.
[14206.27s -> 14220.00s]  Is this at Sotophis' punishment for not listening to you?
[14226.27s -> 14230.48s]  This wretched world.
[14232.00s -> 14237.74s]  Still got power?
[14260.62s -> 14260.94s]  Huh?
[14283.20s -> 14283.52s]  No.
[14283.52s -> 14284.48s]  Do we not have the power?
[14288.32s -> 14288.64s]  Sid.
[14289.36s -> 14292.42s]  Do you feel it too?
[14301.26s -> 14302.22s]  By the flames.
[14302.22s -> 14313.63s]  The harvest is hungry.
[14313.63s -> 14318.10s]  Been too much, Aether.
[14318.74s -> 14319.94s]  She can't control it.
[14321.14s -> 14322.72s]  Rude isn't stopped.
[14322.72s -> 14325.04s]  That vortex will swallow this whole forest
[14325.04s -> 14326.00s]  and us along with it.
[14327.36s -> 14328.72s]  And I'll stop her.
[14328.72s -> 14330.00s]  You'll stop her.
[14330.00s -> 14330.88s]  I heard it again.
[14331.68s -> 14332.64s]  Someone is calling me.
[14333.44s -> 14334.56s]  Come in, lad.
[14334.56s -> 14336.08s]  That doesn't mean you have to listen.
[14337.52s -> 14338.80s]  Well, I should have gone with you.
[14339.92s -> 14340.24s]  Yeah.
[14342.14s -> 14343.74s]  Best character in the whole franchise.
[14344.70s -> 14349.79s]  Okay.
[14349.79s -> 14351.63s]  Clyde, I don't think you understand.
[14352.43s -> 14354.83s]  That's not just windy weather you're wandering into.
[14355.55s -> 14357.87s]  Benedict's rage knows no bounds.
[14358.51s -> 14359.95s]  And that's on a good day.
[14360.83s -> 14362.93s]  I don't want to know what's waiting inside that.
[14363.57s -> 14364.29s]  But I do.
[14365.25s -> 14366.29s]  I have to find out.
[14366.29s -> 14367.09s]  That's all you have to say.
[14367.09s -> 14368.05s]  And I'm not turning back.
[14368.05s -> 14369.17s]  That's the only thing you have to say is,
[14369.17s -> 14370.77s]  I don't care where we're going.
[14370.77s -> 14371.01s]  Okay.
[14371.97s -> 14380.21s]  What is this?
[14380.21s -> 14388.50s]  There are so many.
[14389.62s -> 14393.31s]  I won for every fragment of our mind.
[14393.31s -> 14394.11s]  I'm just trying to get items.
[14394.99s -> 14401.71s]  Three bloody finds.
[14402.43s -> 14408.83s]  All right, let's go.
[14413.02s -> 14413.58s]  Yep.
[14427.02s -> 14428.06s]  Oh, that looks good.
[14428.86s -> 14434.22s]  I'm always late on that one.
[14451.81s -> 14452.37s]  Everybody in?
[14453.41s -> 14459.86s]  Have you learned the parry system?
[14460.50s -> 14461.30s]  I have.
[14461.30s -> 14463.30s]  But I'm a dodge Andy.
[14464.18s -> 14466.58s]  And I'm way more comfortable dodging frame.
[14467.22s -> 14471.78s]  Um, invulnerability frame thing than I am Barry.
[14472.42s -> 14475.22s]  It's cool that you can do it though.
[14506.38s -> 14522.64s]  And understandable.
[14522.64s -> 14523.36s]  Have a nice day.
[14524.16s -> 14524.40s]  What?
[14525.04s -> 14526.43s]  Have a nice day, I guess.
[14527.15s -> 14530.74s]  Barry is hard in this game.
[14530.74s -> 14533.06s]  It did feel like it was tricky to pull off.
[14544.30s -> 14544.54s]  Hi.
[14578.69s -> 14582.53s]  Oh, that was like perfect.
[14583.49s -> 14587.82s]  Wait, this is an item right here.
[14588.46s -> 14590.42s]  How long is the game?
[14591.22s -> 14591.94s]  That's a good question.
[14595.09s -> 14596.21s]  I want to say probably,
[14598.80s -> 14599.92s]  I don't think anyone's beaten it.
[14599.92s -> 14600.56s]  It came out today.
[14601.76s -> 14623.74s]  Let me try doing this move.
[14623.74s -> 14624.70s]  See if I can get it perfect.
[14625.50s -> 14629.25s]  It's not quite.
[14658.96s -> 14659.76s]  Sick of Torgl.
[14660.40s -> 14662.26s]  Yeah, we finally got to hear it.
[14662.98s -> 14665.07s]  All right, I want to get the item that was over here.
[14665.71s -> 14671.18s]  And do that thing with your face.
[14671.18s -> 14672.06s]  So what do you want to do?
[14673.89s -> 14674.13s]  This?
[14683.58s -> 14685.02s]  Yeah, thanks, dude.
[14720.13s -> 14727.28s]  You look a bit sloppy today.
[14728.72s -> 14730.48s]  I was, no, I was going to do something weird.
[14737.28s -> 14739.28s]  I feel like I'm having a dream watching this.
[14739.28s -> 14741.12s]  Why does I have a beard?
[14749.25s -> 14750.05s]  Oh, one of these things.
[14750.69s -> 14757.49s]  Who the hell are you?
[14757.49s -> 14758.21s]  Who the hell are you?
[14760.51s -> 14779.60s]  I feel like this is going to be a pretty,
[14780.32s -> 14782.56s]  it's going to be a milestone of the video game.
[14782.56s -> 14783.36s]  I think come on up here.
[14785.04s -> 14790.50s]  I am going to go back because I think it's time to upgrade.
[14806.51s -> 14807.63s]  Detour Danny.
[14809.79s -> 14813.95s]  I mean, yeah, I'm not going to go with just broken up shit weapons.
[14814.59s -> 14817.55s]  What do you got?
[14823.38s -> 14828.29s]  There's now a bastard sword.
[14828.29s -> 14832.61s]  So sell the bastard, sell the long sword by the bastard sword
[14832.61s -> 14838.37s]  and then upgrade the bastard sword.
[14838.37s -> 14845.09s]  It's a good sword for you.
[14845.73s -> 14850.67s]  It's okay to be scared of birds.
[14850.67s -> 14851.87s]  You can be, I love birds.
[14852.51s -> 14857.01s]  Do you know how badly I've wanted a bird to land on my finger?
[14857.01s -> 14859.49s]  Do you know how much I want that?
[14859.49s -> 14861.87s]  There's hummingbirds all over Vegas.
[14861.87s -> 14863.58s]  They're everywhere.
[14863.58s -> 14866.54s]  And I would like nothing more than to be able to put my hand out
[14866.54s -> 14870.22s]  and just Disney fucking princess have one land on my finger.
[14870.86s -> 14873.34s]  Do you understand how important that is to me?
[14873.34s -> 14875.18s]  Do you know how important that would be to me?
[14875.82s -> 14877.10s]  It'd be a huge deal.
[14877.10s -> 14877.98s]  It would change my whole life.
[14877.98s -> 14878.86s]  That would be life changing.
[14878.86s -> 14880.14s]  That would change my entire life.
[14884.50s -> 14886.66s]  I'm not, I ain't going to hear anybody tell me I'm afraid of birds.
[14886.66s -> 14887.46s]  Okay.
[14887.46s -> 14891.74s]  Do you even try?
[14892.75s -> 14894.75s]  Yeah, I have.
[14894.75s -> 14900.21s]  Do you know how many times I've thought like, wait, is today the day?
[14900.21s -> 14906.11s]  It's today the day because the outside and you'll hear them.
[14906.11s -> 14906.91s]  You'll hear them.
[14908.35s -> 14910.43s]  They sound like massive hornets.
[14910.43s -> 14912.51s]  So for the first spot, you have to be really aware of it.
[14914.24s -> 14920.43s]  Hummingbirds have been like, just kind of just hovering in front of me before.
[14920.43s -> 14928.08s]  It's just like, and they're gone.
[14933.17s -> 14938.22s]  I just, I just like did, I just did the guy's voice for one second.
[14942.10s -> 14942.50s]  Jeez.
[14943.82s -> 14944.38s]  All right.
[14944.38s -> 14945.10s]  We good.
[14945.10s -> 14948.54s]  Yeah. You know, how many times I've been just,
[14949.34s -> 14953.18s]  and I was imagining one landing and just doing this, doing this,
[14953.18s -> 14954.06s]  you know what I'm saying?
[14954.06s -> 14958.08s]  This, you know what I mean?
[14958.08s -> 14959.44s]  Like, who are you?
[14959.44s -> 14960.32s]  Who are you?
[14960.32s -> 14960.80s]  Who are you?
[14960.80s -> 14961.68s]  Who are you?
[14961.68s -> 14963.42s]  I'm just like, you're looking at me.
[14963.42s -> 14965.42s]  I know when you turn your head to the side, you're looking at me.
[14965.42s -> 14970.70s]  You would be a toucan.
[14970.70s -> 14971.58s]  Definitely.
[14971.58s -> 14972.78s]  What a cool bird.
[14972.78s -> 14974.14s]  What an amazing bird.
[14974.14s -> 14975.78s]  That sounds awesome.
[14975.78s -> 14978.64s]  What a cool.
[14978.64s -> 14980.24s]  Oh dude, you'd be a toucan.
[14980.24s -> 14981.36s]  That's fucking cool.
[14981.36s -> 14982.96s]  What a cool animal that is.
[14982.96s -> 14992.10s]  Your webcam looks really crusty today.
[14992.10s -> 14993.86s]  I think I look crusty.
[14993.86s -> 14996.70s]  You just don't want to say that.
[14996.70s -> 14997.10s]  All right.
[14997.10s -> 15004.27s]  I'm buying the bastard sword and I'm going to sell.
[15008.96s -> 15013.57s]  I'm going to sell the long sword and then upgrade the bastard sword.
[15028.13s -> 15028.61s]  120.
[15028.61s -> 15028.77s]  All right.
[15028.77s -> 15029.65s]  So it was the right idea.
[15033.95s -> 15037.60s]  Oh, well now I have two.
[15049.66s -> 15050.06s]  It's all right.
[15050.62s -> 15051.98s]  I got 130 damage now.
[15051.98s -> 15052.78s]  Better than what I had before.
[15058.29s -> 15059.01s]  I guess I can.
[15061.44s -> 15062.88s]  Torgl doesn't have an inventory.
[15063.74s -> 15065.18s]  I love this down here.
[15065.18s -> 15069.52s]  This is great.
[15069.52s -> 15071.84s]  It doesn't seem to have an inventory.
[15076.11s -> 15077.55s]  This seems like it can be upgraded though.
[15083.70s -> 15086.50s]  Okay, actually, it's probably better stuff to put on.
[15096.11s -> 15096.91s]  Dark sash.
[15097.71s -> 15106.51s]  Steel crowns.
[15108.74s -> 15110.50s]  This is way better than what I have right now.
[15123.20s -> 15123.84s]  Iron belt.
[15124.80s -> 15125.20s]  Can't do.
[15125.20s -> 15126.88s]  I'll put dark sash on.
[15132.50s -> 15133.54s]  Bastard sword plus two.
[15136.83s -> 15138.03s]  And then steel crowns.
[15138.99s -> 15140.43s]  Now let me sell this other stuff.
[15141.15s -> 15144.45s]  Oh, I actually do.
[15144.45s -> 15144.93s]  It's just different.
[15145.49s -> 15150.24s]  Doesn't it look different from my mind?
[15157.68s -> 15160.69s]  Hey, I crafted it and made money.
[15161.25s -> 15162.35s]  That's how I see it.
[15171.06s -> 15174.11s]  I don't want to sell any of these.
[15180.66s -> 15181.62s]  I'm not buying potions either.
[15185.20s -> 15185.60s]  All right.
[15185.60s -> 15186.32s]  I'm good.
[15186.32s -> 15187.60s]  Let's continue with what we're doing.
[15188.16s -> 15195.06s]  New weapon upgraded.
[15195.06s -> 15195.46s]  Let's go.
[15196.02s -> 15201.84s]  You'd be a screeching owl.
[15210.38s -> 15211.39s]  Count based.
[15212.03s -> 15227.15s]  Oh, that's what we saw when we were...
[15245.22s -> 15246.90s]  I was under the impression that we did that.
[15248.98s -> 15254.14s]  I thought we did that.
[15261.01s -> 15261.49s]  Maybe not.
[15267.31s -> 15280.43s]  Lost our party members.
[15282.98s -> 15284.02s]  Awakening.
[15284.02s -> 15297.71s]  Where did he go?
[15309.22s -> 15340.56s]  Oh, shit.
[15342.24s -> 15343.36s]  Oh, do I have to dodge?
[15360.75s -> 15361.55s]  We cut the shit.
[15384.59s -> 15384.83s]  All right.
[15384.83s -> 15386.03s]  So what's the deal?
[15386.03s -> 15386.91s]  Is it us?
[15386.91s -> 15387.79s]  Is it you?
[15387.79s -> 15389.07s]  Is it her?
[15397.78s -> 15398.26s]  Is this...
[15398.26s -> 15399.06s]  Is this Joshua?
[15399.62s -> 15400.90s]  This is Joshua.
[15400.90s -> 15421.49s]  All right.
[15421.49s -> 15421.89s]  Let's go.
[15422.77s -> 15428.66s]  She's huge.
[15447.02s -> 15447.74s]  Holy shit.
[15447.74s -> 15448.06s]  Okay.
[15448.06s -> 15448.62s]  We got to go.
[15466.08s -> 15466.88s]  Holy shit.
[15466.88s -> 15467.36s]  That hurt.
[15486.38s -> 15487.10s]  Take down.
[15487.10s -> 15488.86s]  Larger enemies will become partially staggered
[15488.86s -> 15491.18s]  when their will gauges are reduced to 50%.
[15492.61s -> 15494.05s]  Using Garuda's deadly embrace
[15494.05s -> 15496.21s]  on a partially staggered enemy will topple it,
[15496.21s -> 15498.37s]  leaving it vulnerable to follow-up attacks.
[15499.33s -> 15499.57s]  Okay.
[15500.45s -> 15504.03s]  So deadly embrace.
[15504.83s -> 15506.69s]  I don't even have that equipped.
[15507.57s -> 15509.73s]  Oh, yes, I do.
[15551.18s -> 15552.54s]  It's in mod chat right now.
[15553.34s -> 15555.02s]  What is in mod chat right now?
[15566.48s -> 15567.04s]  10k.
[15567.04s -> 15567.52s]  Let's go.
[15584.74s -> 15585.54s]  Oh, jeez.
[15586.50s -> 15599.23s]  I think I just have to avoid it.
[15607.76s -> 15610.08s]  Oh, that hurt a lot.
[15611.20s -> 15643.60s]  Oh, pull her down.
[15676.72s -> 15677.20s]  It hurt.
[15678.00s -> 15712.78s]  Goodbye.
[15712.78s -> 15713.66s]  Perfect music.
[15744.88s -> 15745.12s]  Oh.
[15747.65s -> 15749.55s]  Oh, it's over.
[15754.11s -> 15754.51s]  Pause.
[15755.81s -> 15756.13s]  Damn.
[15756.85s -> 15760.37s]  That was cool.
[15760.37s -> 15762.43s]  Music's...
[15762.43s -> 15764.35s]  Honestly, music's probably my favorite part.
[15764.35s -> 15768.06s]  There's so many different ups and downs.
[15768.06s -> 15768.70s]  There's so many different...
[15769.42s -> 15770.46s]  Yeah, it's great.
[15770.46s -> 15773.66s]  55 fangs came out of that.
[15773.74s -> 15786.93s]  Dude, I have to show you what they put in mod chat.
[15786.93s -> 15788.37s]  It is fucking crazy.
[15792.38s -> 15795.18s]  Some of these are fucking insane.
[15796.30s -> 15797.98s]  What even is this supposed to be?
[15798.86s -> 15799.34s]  I'm gonna...
[15799.34s -> 15799.74s]  Hold on.
[15799.74s -> 15800.54s]  Just watch the cutscene.
[15800.54s -> 15801.42s]  I don't want to fuck this up
[15801.42s -> 15803.18s]  because this is like insane.
[15804.22s -> 15815.07s]  Wait.
[15815.07s -> 15815.39s]  Uh-oh.
[15840.22s -> 15840.62s]  Uh-oh.
[15840.62s -> 15858.40s]  It's me, right?
[15858.40s -> 15859.04s]  That's what I...
[15859.04s -> 15859.92s]  That's what I was thinking.
[15861.47s -> 15861.71s]  Yeah.
[15862.35s -> 15894.56s]  It's in emote now.
[15895.60s -> 15898.37s]  Oh, shit.
[15899.17s -> 15904.38s]  I think this is gonna be a big deal.
[15905.34s -> 15914.16s]  All right.
[15914.16s -> 15916.00s]  That's really funny, but I need to pay attention.
[15916.72s -> 15922.99s]  No way.
[15922.99s -> 15924.11s]  Do I get to play like this?
[15925.97s -> 15926.61s]  You do.
[15926.61s -> 15926.93s]  Okay.
[15928.27s -> 15928.75s]  Ifrit.
[15929.47s -> 15931.90s]  Melee ranged and evade.
[15932.54s -> 15936.37s]  Charging enemy covering great.
[15936.37s -> 15937.65s]  This is a short period of time,
[15937.65s -> 15940.21s]  as well as dealing damage if the enemy is struck.
[15940.93s -> 15943.47s]  All abilities available while embodying Ifrit
[15943.47s -> 15946.59s]  can be obtained and confirmed on the abilities tab.
[15946.59s -> 15946.99s]  Let's go.
[15955.02s -> 15956.14s]  Monster battle time.
[15964.00s -> 15965.20s]  Oh, that was good.
[15966.08s -> 15972.32s]  Holy shit.
[15973.81s -> 15975.41s]  85,000 damage.
[15984.46s -> 15984.86s]  Punch.
[15985.50s -> 16011.90s]  Skyfall.
[16012.86s -> 16019.57s]  Tap.
[16020.05s -> 16021.10s]  No.
[16021.90s -> 16048.53s]  Uh-oh.
[16049.17s -> 16049.89s]  I'm now losing.
[16050.77s -> 16071.81s]  Oh, 30k.
[16092.86s -> 16093.82s]  Oh, shit.
[16093.90s -> 16094.38s]  That's better.
[16114.78s -> 16115.42s]  You stink.
[16116.06s -> 16133.20s]  Oh, my God.
[16134.48s -> 16135.04s]  Jesus.
[16135.92s -> 16156.27s]  Is this an arm?
[16157.60s -> 16158.16s]  Oh, shit.
[16159.52s -> 16178.86s]  Holy shit.
[16179.50s -> 16186.27s]  Sid right now is down on the ground floor.
[16187.23s -> 16191.62s]  Just like, I can't do any of that shit.
[16193.10s -> 16195.74s]  Gonna be up to you for the rest of the game.
[16196.86s -> 16202.19s]  I thought lightning was cool.
[16202.19s -> 16202.75s]  Not really.
[16211.30s -> 16212.42s]  And we're both throwing back.
[16212.98s -> 16227.23s]  This is awesome.
[16227.23s -> 16227.55s]  What?
[16228.43s -> 16233.33s]  Oh, am I ripping the arms?
[16262.93s -> 16263.73s]  Hellfire?
[16264.86s -> 16265.74s]  Hellfire!
[16267.02s -> 16268.06s]  Hellfire!
[16278.66s -> 16278.90s]  That?
[16280.42s -> 16285.12s]  That sequence took like four months to animate.
[16286.37s -> 16287.73s]  That was crazy.
[16287.73s -> 16294.48s]  That was really cool.
[16296.29s -> 16297.41s]  Wind shard.
[16297.41s -> 16307.17s]  Is there any more or is that it?
[16307.17s -> 16326.10s]  Control Nick Clive.
[16326.10s -> 16328.64s]  It is you, isn't it, Clive?
[16333.78s -> 16335.22s]  Oh, here we go again.
[16336.50s -> 16337.00s]  Now.
[16337.46s -> 16351.65s]  He's not gonna activate into public.
[16351.65s -> 16352.77s]  No, he's not, right?
[16353.33s -> 16354.13s]  We're doing this again?
[16365.95s -> 16368.11s]  What the fuck is going on in this game?
[16369.84s -> 16370.16s]  What?
[16375.55s -> 16376.99s]  It's like a giant wizard.
[16382.85s -> 16413.87s]  Does he shrink back down to?
[16415.55s -> 16424.96s]  You're too nice as your problem.
[16425.60s -> 16427.50s]  Tells you to quit it, dude.
[16427.50s -> 16427.74s]  Yeah.
[16428.38s -> 16432.40s]  That's this.
[16432.40s -> 16448.14s]  Okay, well, so do I, can I get electricity out of my hands?
[16449.02s -> 16450.78s]  Because that's what I'm into.
[16452.29s -> 16453.25s]  Lorecheck, please.
[16453.89s -> 16465.01s]  The Warden of the Wind who Benedict had transformed into during her ill-fated flight
[16465.01s -> 16468.69s]  from the Empire takes the form of a fearful harpy,
[16468.69s -> 16474.83s]  summoning storms and tearing into the flesh to prey with hawk-like talons.
[16474.83s -> 16482.38s]  Such is the icon's frenzy for destruction that even allies of the dominant of the day won't.
[16482.38s -> 16484.99s]  And let's try that again.
[16484.99s -> 16488.59s]  For destruction that even allies of the dominant of the day are won't
[16488.59s -> 16492.11s]  to begin fleeting the battlefield when dark clouds gather over.
[16492.11s -> 16497.09s]  Wait, am I reading this wrong?
[16497.09s -> 16498.53s]  Am I reading this wrong?
[16498.53s -> 16503.58s]  I feel like, why can I not read this right?
[16503.58s -> 16505.34s]  Well, that happened.
[16505.34s -> 16506.78s]  All right, well, I love how it's like,
[16508.14s -> 16510.70s]  you have like 10 notifications about Sudolphus.
[16510.70s -> 16512.14s]  You have a lot of notifications.
[16512.14s -> 16514.62s]  He's been DMing you about his fucking wizard form.
[16542.43s -> 16543.07s]  That picture.
[16543.07s -> 16547.92s]  The ghost you've been chasing was inside you all along.
[16547.92s -> 16550.40s]  This fucking picture is ridiculous.
[16550.40s -> 16551.44s]  Who even made this?
[16555.79s -> 16557.15s]  I'm going to try to look like that.
[16557.15s -> 16558.59s]  I'm going to just grow everything.
[16558.59s -> 16560.67s]  Just turn the camera on one day, I'm going to look like this.
[16561.47s -> 16570.10s]  And there has to be a part during one of that stream where I laugh like this.
[16575.12s -> 16577.44s]  And my teeth are like black.
[16577.92s -> 16598.61s]  Why did you have to listen to him?
[16605.15s -> 16608.03s]  This can't be what you wanted, can it?
[16623.50s -> 16623.82s]  Dad.
[16659.90s -> 16661.55s]  Some time later.
[16661.55s -> 16662.67s]  How much later is this?
[16663.55s -> 16672.03s]  Who the fuck is this?
[16672.59s -> 16673.71s]  Who is this?
[16673.71s -> 16674.83s]  That horse is giant.
[16674.83s -> 16675.39s]  Oh my God.
[16675.39s -> 16678.40s]  The king is bold, desperate.
[16678.40s -> 16684.22s]  Will you engage him personally, your highness?
[16684.78s -> 16687.23s]  Of course.
[16687.23s -> 16688.67s]  Am I going to engage him personally?
[16688.67s -> 16690.43s]  Of course I'm going to turn into a giant whale.
[16691.39s -> 16693.47s]  You don't think I have the giant dolphin power?
[16693.47s -> 16694.91s]  Griegel's breath fill your wings.
[16694.91s -> 16696.27s]  You know what the fuck you're talking to?
[16700.03s -> 16700.67s]  Yep.
[16700.67s -> 16720.03s]  The Hombet.
[16720.03s -> 16721.07s]  The prince is with us.
[16741.94s -> 16743.14s]  New music track too.
[16744.02s -> 16771.49s]  Am I going to have to fight all these things eventually?
[16774.53s -> 16793.18s]  Precision?
[16793.18s -> 16794.91s]  Yeah.
[16794.91s -> 16795.95s]  Reform the cohorts.
[16796.51s -> 16809.70s]  At once, your highness.
[16809.70s -> 16810.98s]  I can't get over.
[16810.98s -> 16814.02s]  I can't get over the germa that drank the chaos potion.
[16814.66s -> 16817.46s]  You know, I've got powers but I'm all fucked up now.
[16845.33s -> 16860.78s]  That was cool.
[16862.75s -> 16863.71s]  No, I don't want to lore check.
[16863.71s -> 16865.63s]  I don't want to spoil myself or anything.
[16886.27s -> 16892.14s]  You plan on streaming the whole game?
[16894.08s -> 16896.19s]  Let's figure that out.
[16896.19s -> 16897.63s]  I'm going to ask you that very question.
[16897.95s -> 16899.39s]  Ah, you're awake.
[16899.95s -> 16902.82s]  Because I really like it.
[16902.82s -> 16903.70s]  I would.
[16903.70s -> 16905.22s]  You're just full of surprises.
[16905.22s -> 16906.02s]  I think it's fun.
[16906.02s -> 16909.94s]  First that trick with Geruda, then whatever the hell that other thing was.
[16912.53s -> 16914.21s]  Didn't know you had it in you.
[16916.96s -> 16918.91s]  Do it.
[16918.91s -> 16919.41s]  Hey.
[16925.47s -> 16926.19s]  It was me.
[16927.23s -> 16928.03s]  I killed him.
[16928.99s -> 16930.83s]  I killed Joshua.
[16930.83s -> 16931.95s]  I killed them all.
[16932.67s -> 16933.79s]  I'm a monster.
[16934.83s -> 16936.51s]  And I deserve to die.
[16938.35s -> 16939.23s]  So end it.
[16940.27s -> 16940.77s]  End it.
[16941.95s -> 16942.45s]  Please.
[16943.07s -> 16943.57s]  Please.
[16951.65s -> 16952.93s]  I reckon I can take you.
[16953.81s -> 16954.85s]  If that's what you want.
[16957.62s -> 16963.06s]  But first, I thought I'd give you the benefit of my timeless wisdom.
[16967.01s -> 16967.97s]  It seems to me-
[16967.97s -> 16968.85s]  Take him in a fight.
[16969.41s -> 16973.65s]  But since you're still breathing, you might as well make yourself useful.
[16973.65s -> 16974.61s]  I don't know about that.
[16976.66s -> 16977.30s]  Get dressed.
[16978.18s -> 16980.58s]  Pretty as you are, you're not my type.
[16985.98s -> 16988.54s]  I'll see you in the hole.
[16988.54s -> 16993.49s]  I don't know, I have uncontrollable demon rage.
[16996.88s -> 17002.61s]  He's a cool wizard, but I mean, gigantic demon.
[17002.61s -> 17006.58s]  I think I can win.
[17006.58s -> 17024.93s]  He just beat you.
[17024.93s -> 17026.37s]  Yeah, but I wasn't prepared.
[17026.37s -> 17028.21s]  What are you going to do now?
[17028.21s -> 17035.28s]  Plus, I was fighting Garuda, who was also one of these icons.
[17035.28s -> 17039.01s]  Wages of guilt.
[17039.01s -> 17046.83s]  There are certain times during the game that side quests will become temporarily unavailable
[17046.83s -> 17049.39s]  until progress has been made through the main scenario.
[17049.39s -> 17053.84s]  Okay, so I have to focus on the main story.
[17053.84s -> 17056.24s]  There's, we'll hear what he has to say.
[17062.03s -> 17064.75s]  Don't go making me throw you back in there now, eh?
[17065.98s -> 17066.48s]  Hello, Doug.
[17067.18s -> 17075.89s]  I think I'm just gonna upgrade if I can.
[17076.61s -> 17077.33s]  So, what'd it be?
[17078.13s -> 17078.69s]  What is that?
[17079.41s -> 17081.41s]  That's the, okay, this is, this one's purple.
[17086.45s -> 17087.17s]  Storm Cry.
[17091.52s -> 17093.28s]  That's way cooler than the Bastard Sword.
[17093.84s -> 17106.22s]  Does it have any properties on it or is it just, they don't get it?
[17108.38s -> 17109.66s]  No scratches, right?
[17113.81s -> 17115.33s]  Can't reinforce it.
[17115.33s -> 17118.00s]  Anything else?
[17118.64s -> 17122.62s]  Ooh, cool looking.
[17122.62s -> 17128.70s]  Can I buy anything from you out here?
[17129.42s -> 17131.02s]  Look what the curl dragged in.
[17131.98s -> 17133.50s]  Coin purse weighing you down?
[17142.32s -> 17143.12s]  This is just better.
[17143.92s -> 17144.48s]  Call my guy.
[17144.48s -> 17146.72s]  Hold on, can I make anything new besides the sword?
[17146.72s -> 17148.72s]  I'm not much bothered either way.
[17148.72s -> 17151.66s]  Play it quick.
[17152.22s -> 17155.82s]  What do you want?
[17155.82s -> 17176.05s]  What am I wearing for a belt right now?
[17176.05s -> 17178.27s]  This one, right?
[17180.24s -> 17180.80s]  Plus two.
[17181.60s -> 17184.88s]  I need a plus one, but don't I already, oh, I have a plus two.
[17184.88s -> 17187.60s]  I just don't, I can't upgrade any more plus, uh, pass plus two.
[17189.25s -> 17190.93s]  Okay, well, I have the new weapon.
[17190.93s -> 17191.49s]  That's all that matters.
[17191.49s -> 17192.05s]  Anything else?
[17192.85s -> 17198.42s]  Hi, can we, can we get a poll in chat?
[17199.73s -> 17204.38s]  Do you want me to continue to stream Final Fantasy 16?
[17205.42s -> 17207.26s]  It would probably be on the, just chill nights.
[17207.98s -> 17211.04s]  Probably turn the cam off, play it and just hang out.
[17211.60s -> 17212.08s]  What do you think?
[17212.08s -> 17212.64s]  Can we get a poll?
[17213.36s -> 17216.78s]  I really like it.
[17216.78s -> 17218.70s]  So I'm going to play it regardless.
[17218.70s -> 17221.74s]  So I'm either going to, I'm either going to turn it on and just play it
[17221.74s -> 17225.34s]  for fun, just chilling out on stream or I'm just going to play this
[17225.34s -> 17227.02s]  and just with my mouth open on the couch.
[17227.66s -> 17235.62s]  That has to be 85% at least since you gave that same number
[17235.62s -> 17237.38s]  to Strawberry Magic.
[17237.38s -> 17240.42s]  Strawberry Magic is not Final Fantasy 16.
[17240.42s -> 17245.71s]  Final Fantasy 16 is a little different than Strawberry Magic was.
[17246.82s -> 17247.78s]  I would say.
[17247.78s -> 17248.82s]  I think that's a little different.
[17249.46s -> 17256.90s]  I mean, most people are into it.
[17256.90s -> 17258.74s]  Then I'll keep playing it.
[17258.74s -> 17261.07s]  I mean, that's pretty overwhelming.
[17261.07s -> 17262.99s]  That seems like it was almost 90%.
[17264.03s -> 17266.51s]  Yeah, I'll, I'll just stream it more.
[17272.27s -> 17275.31s]  Uh, I'm going to do this next mission and then I'm probably going to call it.
[17275.31s -> 17278.27s]  So whatever happens at the end of this, that'll be it for tonight.
[17278.27s -> 17279.23s]  I'll see you on Saturday.
[17279.87s -> 17282.83s]  Uh, the sponsor is obviously Square Enix, sponsor of the stream,
[17282.83s -> 17284.11s]  but I kind of kept going.
[17288.21s -> 17288.77s]  Very, very fun.
[17297.81s -> 17298.69s]  What are you going to do with the demos?
[17301.65s -> 17302.61s]  Uh, Saturday.
[17308.53s -> 17308.77s]  Gav.
[17312.45s -> 17314.21s]  Gav's gone through a fair bit of trouble for you.
[17314.85s -> 17317.17s]  The least you can do is hear the poor bugger out.
[17317.89s -> 17319.54s]  He's going to meet us at the King's.
[17319.54s -> 17322.82s]  Yes, we'll play SOS 3 on Saturday and we'll do some steam demos.
[17324.96s -> 17328.16s]  And then after that, after Saturday, I'll probably come back to this and just play.
[17328.72s -> 17331.60s]  Oh yeah, I Square Enix, thanks for the sponsor.
[17331.60s -> 17333.28s]  Um, the game's great.
[17333.84s -> 17336.40s]  It's out on PS5 right now.
[17336.40s -> 17337.52s]  Came out literally today.
[17338.64s -> 17339.92s]  It's very good.
[17340.56s -> 17341.76s]  The demo is available.
[17341.76s -> 17343.92s]  You can just get the demo and play it if you want right now.
[17343.92s -> 17346.72s]  You've seen it already, but if you want to check it out, maybe see if it's for you.
[17347.68s -> 17348.75s]  I think it's great.
[17348.75s -> 17349.47s]  I'm having a lot of fun.
[17349.47s -> 17350.27s]  I'm going to continue to play it.
[17350.27s -> 17351.23s]  I'm going to keep streaming it.
[17351.23s -> 17356.16s]  So, but for now, let's, um, let's finish up this last mission
[17356.16s -> 17357.68s]  and then I will call it and see you Saturday.
[17358.32s -> 17365.41s]  Uh, I don't think I need any other items.
[17372.42s -> 17377.86s]  We waited 295 days for a half a stream of sorcery.
[17377.86s -> 17382.77s]  Dude, you're a booger streamer.
[17388.22s -> 17390.38s]  Yeah, I'm not just getting half a stream of sorcery.
[17390.38s -> 17393.66s]  You're getting us getting back into sorcery.
[17394.46s -> 17398.30s]  Plus you're getting, I'm going to do voices.
[17398.30s -> 17404.96s]  German does voices, right?
[17404.96s -> 17406.40s]  It's so funny when German does voices.
[17408.90s -> 17412.90s]  You'll get at least two or three different tones and two or three different pitches.
[17413.78s -> 17415.46s]  Someone's going to sound like this.
[17415.46s -> 17416.66s]  Isn't that cool?
[17416.66s -> 17417.54s]  Isn't that weird?
[17426.86s -> 17428.14s]  And I'll do the dinosaur quiz.
[17428.14s -> 17429.26s]  What dinosaur are you?
[17444.16s -> 17445.84s]  Please think about it.
[17445.84s -> 17455.68s]  Clive, the rumors all point to that was an Imperial signal.
[17456.80s -> 17457.68s]  There shouldn't be here.
[17458.24s -> 17459.92s]  The old force been abandoned for years.
[17461.54s -> 17462.74s]  Our little chat can wait.
[17463.38s -> 17465.14s]  I need to see what the bastards are up to.
[17465.14s -> 17468.02s]  For those of you that didn't know, I know we talked about it a few times,
[17468.02s -> 17471.62s]  but you liked Final Fantasy 14.
[17473.33s -> 17478.90s]  The producer and director of Final Fantasy 14, producer of this game.
[17482.11s -> 17484.59s]  I know that a lot of people really like that game.
[17484.59s -> 17501.74s]  So you obviously got the devil may cry, Yoshi P, Yoshi P, Yoshi P is a legend.
[17506.64s -> 17510.72s]  Honestly, I wait till he's done talking.
[17514.38s -> 17516.22s]  I was never really into Final Fantasy.
[17517.42s -> 17519.66s]  I was a big, I liked the old ones,
[17520.38s -> 17522.78s]  but I didn't really pay that much attention past like six or seven.
[17522.78s -> 17523.10s]  Really?
[17525.76s -> 17526.48s]  This is good.
[17526.48s -> 17527.28s]  This is really good.
[17528.59s -> 17529.95s]  I'm very happy with it so far.
[17534.45s -> 17538.83s]  Oh, there's a giant enemy.
[17539.79s -> 17566.34s]  Spiders have a follow up to that, don't I?
[17609.81s -> 17610.05s]  Cool.
[17617.15s -> 17620.11s]  Yeah, the composer and sound director of Final Fantasy 14.
[17620.83s -> 17621.71s]  That's soaking.
[17622.43s -> 17622.91s]  Don't know.
[17623.71s -> 17624.51s]  Also on this game.
[17625.47s -> 17627.87s]  Somebody said this is like a dream team for Final Fantasy,
[17628.99s -> 17631.41s]  which that's really cool.
[17632.05s -> 17650.70s]  Is that a Minotaur?
[17655.42s -> 17656.38s]  It is a Minotaur.
[17661.20s -> 17661.76s]  All right, let's go.
[17662.32s -> 17683.73s]  Pull him down.
[17692.48s -> 17697.07s]  Oh, I'm having heels.
[17697.87s -> 17747.82s]  Oh, that was perfect.
[17754.00s -> 17755.28s]  Oh, cool down.
[17759.81s -> 17771.06s]  Oh, I did not time that right.
[17771.70s -> 17772.90s]  All right, don't blow it here.
[17772.90s -> 17773.30s]  Don't blow it.
[17773.30s -> 17773.70s]  Don't blow it.
[17774.74s -> 17775.58s]  This time.
[17777.79s -> 17802.94s]  This time.
[17802.94s -> 17806.94s]  If you do Torgl buttons mid-dodge, you'll get precision.
[17807.66s -> 17811.55s]  Cool.
[17811.55s -> 17818.58s]  Pet Torgl, oh, we're going to riot.
[17818.58s -> 17819.30s]  I did already have.
[17819.94s -> 17826.03s]  I love how he's just kind of like, yeah.
[17833.50s -> 17834.30s]  I need to heal.
[17835.26s -> 17838.69s]  Potion.
[17838.69s -> 17844.18s]  I need way more of those.
[17849.82s -> 17851.98s]  He's never going to check the lore ever again.
[17852.86s -> 17859.97s]  Hey, dude.
[17859.97s -> 17862.62s]  The hooded man.
[17862.62s -> 17866.61s]  A mysterious man that many believed to be a dominant of fire.
[17867.17s -> 17871.97s]  Clive first saw him at Phoenix Gate on the night of the Imperial invasion.
[17871.97s -> 17876.53s]  And for years believed him to be the dominant of the icon that killed his brother.
[17876.53s -> 17883.18s]  But to Clive's eternal chagrin, he has proved otherwise.
[17895.49s -> 17896.61s]  Pretty bloody hides.
[17907.60s -> 17928.11s]  What does it mean?
[17928.67s -> 17946.42s]  Oh, that's a good move.
[17972.51s -> 17973.15s]  Awesome music.
[17973.79s -> 17978.62s]  I just keep biting my lip and it's going to cause me stress.
[17979.50s -> 17986.53s]  Still making a little clay guys.
[17987.49s -> 17992.48s]  I actually haven't in a little while, but I'll get back into it.
[17999.90s -> 18000.78s]  Another minotaur.
[18001.34s -> 18002.85s]  Okay.
[18002.85s -> 18004.13s]  Well, I beat one.
[18004.13s -> 18004.85s]  I could beat the other.
[18005.81s -> 18006.61s]  Oh, this is not good.
[18012.80s -> 18015.09s]  I saw him come from a mile away, too.
[18113.63s -> 18122.48s]  Stop hurting these poor animals.
[18123.20s -> 18124.32s]  They don't deserve this.
[18125.12s -> 18136.35s]  You're saying true.
[18137.79s -> 18140.02s]  Is a minotaur an animal?
[18140.74s -> 18142.50s]  What is a minotaur?
[18142.50s -> 18145.38s]  Isn't a minotaur like a guy with horns that's like a bull?
[18146.75s -> 18149.07s]  Minotaur is like a mythical being.
[18157.92s -> 18159.12s]  Half man, half bull.
[18160.40s -> 18161.60s]  Humans are animals.
[18163.65s -> 18169.46s]  Yeah, animals can be mythical, too.
[18171.09s -> 18171.89s]  You're an animal.
[18171.89s -> 18172.93s]  I'm an animal.
[18172.93s -> 18174.13s]  Stop the violence.
[18187.38s -> 18189.38s]  There's no way I'm going to let Gab die.
[18189.46s -> 18191.14s]  I'll be actually upset if Gab dies.
[18192.46s -> 18194.38s]  They keep killing characters.
[18194.38s -> 18195.90s]  I will be upset if Gab is dead.
[18216.64s -> 18220.08s]  Bye.
[18220.96s -> 18249.39s]  Your webcam is atomically...
[18267.86s -> 18268.82s]  Are we doing it?
[18268.82s -> 18269.46s]  Are we doing it?
[18270.42s -> 18274.30s]  No, it's all right.
[18274.30s -> 18274.94s]  What's his name?
[18275.98s -> 18277.90s]  Uncle Fester is here to help us.
[18277.90s -> 18278.54s]  What's his name?
[18280.14s -> 18280.78s]  Forget his name.
[18283.10s -> 18283.66s]  Sid!
[18283.66s -> 18284.22s]  That's it.
[18285.98s -> 18286.30s]  Okay.
[18297.60s -> 18298.40s]  Oh, let's go.
[18341.78s -> 18342.82s]  Do you have any heals, dude?
[18342.82s -> 18343.62s]  Do you have any potions?
[18374.61s -> 18375.09s]  Oh, yeah.
[18375.81s -> 18376.13s]  Shit.
[18385.87s -> 18386.35s]  Uh-oh.
[18387.39s -> 18387.71s]  I got it.
[18387.71s -> 18388.83s]  That's exactly what I was trying to do.
[18414.18s -> 18416.43s]  Oh, shit.
[18449.38s -> 18450.34s]  Jesus Christ.
[18453.47s -> 18459.15s]  I had potions.
[18459.15s -> 18460.83s]  I had potions and I didn't use them.
[18465.55s -> 18465.95s]  Get in.
[18488.98s -> 18490.50s]  That was really, really scary.
[18499.01s -> 18499.65s]  First death.
[18502.34s -> 18503.54s]  Level 19.
[18514.66s -> 18515.30s]  It doesn't matter.
[18515.30s -> 18517.46s]  I had to sneeze and I couldn't even do the fucking funny joke.
[18529.41s -> 18529.97s]  Come on.
[18529.97s -> 18530.69s]  My back is itchy.
[18533.50s -> 18538.30s]  Each fight in this game feels like it has a lot of weight on it.
[18538.30s -> 18542.38s]  It's like everything feels like you're in this and it feels fun.
[18543.34s -> 18544.30s]  Even fighting the spiders.
[18544.94s -> 18548.99s]  We need to save.
[18548.99s -> 18549.55s]  We got to save.
[18549.55s -> 18549.79s]  Yeah.
[18549.79s -> 18551.07s]  No, this is too much.
[18551.07s -> 18552.14s]  It's too much.
[18552.94s -> 18557.78s]  Shit.
[18562.11s -> 18562.67s]  He's not going to...
[18562.67s -> 18565.55s]  His eyes aren't going to turn like red and he's going to turn like a big goose.
[18581.86s -> 18582.42s]  Holy shit.
[18582.42s -> 18583.14s]  That was cool.
[18584.50s -> 18589.86s]  He's holding on to the rock, right?
[18591.42s -> 18591.74s]  Yes.
[18593.82s -> 18597.82s]  He's got the branch, the one branch sticking out from the rock.
[18598.62s -> 18609.82s]  Do not.
[18610.46s -> 18619.82s]  Thank God.
[18621.42s -> 18623.28s]  Thank God.
[18630.75s -> 18647.87s]  Gav has plot armor.
[18647.87s -> 18649.71s]  Well, I don't speak so soon because
[18652.14s -> 18654.46s]  remember the guy that got hit in the face with the axe
[18654.46s -> 18656.14s]  that we didn't even get an introduction for yet?
[18658.14s -> 18661.26s]  He seemed like he was ready to get involved.
[18667.07s -> 18668.43s]  My sniffing days will be over.
[18669.55s -> 18670.03s]  Thank you.
[18671.23s -> 18671.71s]  Truly.
[18672.51s -> 18675.66s]  Yeah, a lot of people have died.
[18675.66s -> 18677.50s]  That would be deemed pretty important, I would say, huh?
[18677.50s -> 18678.62s]  So, what news?
[18679.34s -> 18684.48s]  I found out where your friend's heading for one thing.
[18685.20s -> 18686.96s]  Gav, I...
[18686.96s -> 18691.28s]  Him and his mate are on their way to your old stomping ground, Rosaria.
[18692.16s -> 18696.03s]  You should have seen what they did to the Imperials who tried to stop them.
[18698.50s -> 18699.78s]  There's no question about it.
[18700.66s -> 18703.06s]  He's a dominant fire, all right?
[18703.06s -> 18703.86s]  He can't be.
[18704.26s -> 18708.48s]  Clive, I saw you turn into an icon before my very eyes.
[18709.36s -> 18712.82s]  And yes, there's a good chance it was you who killed the phoenix.
[18713.70s -> 18718.08s]  But we weren't alone, were we?
[18718.08s -> 18720.85s]  There was the fellow you saw enter the whirlwind.
[18721.65s -> 18722.15s]  I...
[18722.99s -> 18723.79s]  I saw him too.
[18724.51s -> 18727.58s]  You didn't dream it, Clive.
[18727.58s -> 18728.30s]  He's out there.
[18728.86s -> 18731.34s]  I don't know who this guy is, but he's chuffing back at that.
[18731.34s -> 18731.84s]  Who is he?
[18732.94s -> 18734.34s]  Ask me.
[18734.34s -> 18735.54s]  I don't bloody know.
[18735.54s -> 18739.66s]  But I do know one thing.
[18740.46s -> 18742.46s]  You're gonna find him and find out.
[18743.26s -> 18745.42s]  It's a cigarette Andy in chat right now.
[18747.65s -> 18749.01s]  We have a few of those here.
[18749.01s -> 18751.09s]  You swore you'd avenge your brother's death.
[18751.65s -> 18754.77s]  That you'd never rest until you'd hunted down the man responsible.
[18756.03s -> 18761.65s]  So, find out if this man's responsible and kill yourself if he's not.
[18764.30s -> 18764.80s]  Sid.
[18765.26s -> 18765.76s]  I...
[18766.22s -> 18767.58s]  Don't thank me.
[18767.58s -> 18768.14s]  Thank Gav.
[18775.52s -> 18776.24s]  Thank you, Gav.
[18777.38s -> 18778.10s]  Yeah, well, yeah.
[18792.22s -> 18792.86s]  Hot stew?
[18794.58s -> 18795.30s]  Crusty bread?
[18796.74s -> 18798.50s]  No birds returning this year.
[18799.22s -> 18804.29s]  The deadlands have swallowed their roosts like it's not.
[18809.22s -> 18810.42s]  We're running out of time.
[18811.14s -> 18813.09s]  That's definitely Joshua.
[18813.09s -> 18814.85s]  We'll be in Rosaria in a day or two.
[18814.85s -> 18815.81s]  It's a phoenix.
[18815.81s -> 18816.77s]  Phoenixes don't die.
[18817.89s -> 18824.72s]  That goes against all phoenix lore ever.
[18824.72s -> 18827.73s]  Back to where it all began.
[18828.77s -> 18829.27s]  Yeah.
[18829.57s -> 18843.10s]  Who's that?
[18843.10s -> 18844.35s]  Who's the girl?
[18844.35s -> 18845.95s]  He must be stopped.
[18845.95s -> 18860.37s]  We don't have the reveal yet.
[18861.33s -> 18863.49s]  Can't lorry check the non-reveal.
[18866.59s -> 18867.79s]  No updated wiki?
[18867.79s -> 18868.43s]  No, not yet.
[18873.68s -> 18874.32s]  All right, cool.
[18875.04s -> 18876.93s]  I think that about calls it for me.
[18878.37s -> 18879.01s]  That was a good time.
[18880.67s -> 18881.63s]  I will play it again.
[18881.63s -> 18882.35s]  We'll stream it again.
[18885.47s -> 18888.83s]  Saturday, we're going to do Steam Next, Best, and Sorcery.
[18888.83s -> 18893.58s]  And then after Saturday, I'll come back to Final Fantasy 16.
[18900.99s -> 18902.03s]  What are your overall thoughts?
[18903.57s -> 18905.63s]  I think it's...
[18906.51s -> 18911.15s]  So the boss fights are some of the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time.
[18911.79s -> 18914.11s]  You just feel like you're doing a good job.
[18914.11s -> 18916.99s]  The game does a really great job of making you think you're doing very well.
[18917.55s -> 18919.07s]  The dodge mechanic is really fun.
[18919.07s -> 18924.27s]  When the follow-up attack, the music that plays in all the fights,
[18924.27s -> 18926.99s]  they vary it up so it's not the same thing every time, which I really like.
[18927.55s -> 18932.53s]  I don't know how big the world is.
[18932.53s -> 18935.41s]  I think that's the one kind of, I guess, outlier is.
[18936.96s -> 18941.04s]  Is there an opportunity for me to go and just kind of play and go collect stuff?
[18941.60s -> 18942.48s]  I'm imagining so.
[18943.57s -> 18945.41s]  But as it stands so far, I think it's great.
[18945.41s -> 18946.13s]  I'm going to keep playing it.
[18957.63s -> 18959.07s]  It looks like there's quite a bit.
[18959.63s -> 18966.56s]  How long have I played so far, including the demo?
[18966.72s -> 18967.84s]  The demo is included in this, too.
[18967.84s -> 18970.96s]  So this is five hours and about five hours and some change.
[18972.46s -> 18974.88s]  Eight? Eight hours total so far.
[18976.06s -> 18976.86s]  Probably another island.
[18977.92s -> 18978.72s]  Yeah, we'll see.
[18979.97s -> 18980.45s]  I like it.
[18980.45s -> 18985.66s]  I'm having a good time playing it, so I'm going to keep playing it.
[18985.66s -> 18989.42s]  And yes, the stream was sponsored, but I think you all know.
[18990.69s -> 18993.49s]  I don't think I would come back to the game and play it again if I wasn't into it.
[18993.49s -> 18995.82s]  So we'll play it again.
[18995.82s -> 18999.74s]  You'll see it on this channel at some point early next week, mid next week.
[18999.74s -> 19006.10s]  It's a good game, yeah.
[19010.11s -> 19011.47s]  And I'll see you Saturday.
[19012.27s -> 19015.63s]  Thank you again Square Enix for sponsoring the stream.
[19016.27s -> 19019.58s]  Again, it's on PS5 right now.
[19019.58s -> 19020.54s]  You have a PS5.
[19020.54s -> 19024.75s]  I highly recommend you at least check out the demo because that is free.
[19024.75s -> 19027.23s]  And you can just play a little bit of the first few hours of the game.
[19027.23s -> 19028.11s]  First like hour or two.
[19028.91s -> 19034.19s]  Well, I want to make sure I save it, though.
[19035.33s -> 19036.37s]  I think it's auto saves.
[19038.51s -> 19039.47s]  Yeah, I think it's auto saves.
[19039.47s -> 19040.19s]  I'll be fine.
[19040.19s -> 19054.37s]  This is coming through my.
[19054.37s -> 19054.85s]  That's weird.
[19054.85s -> 19055.89s]  It's coming through my speakers.
[19059.42s -> 19060.70s]  They're supposed to be music playing, but.
[19061.34s -> 19064.14s]  It's just coming through my actual speakers.
[19064.14s -> 19071.17s]  Can you hear it?
[19071.17s -> 19072.37s]  Very, very faintly.
[19077.47s -> 19081.15s]  Well, it's playing to my right somehow.
[19081.15s -> 19087.36s]  It's only when you talk.
[19087.36s -> 19091.97s]  Well, thanks for sticking around.
[19091.97s -> 19092.77s]  Have a great night.
[19092.77s -> 19094.48s]  Call your mother.
[19094.48s -> 19096.08s]  Final Fantasy 16.
[19096.08s -> 19104.66s]  Go check it out.
[19104.66s -> 19106.02s]  Thank you for resuming sorcery.
[19106.02s -> 19110.72s]  My mother is back from her trip just in time.
[19110.72s -> 19111.76s]  Well, there you go.
[19111.76s -> 19115.07s]  Put it close to the mic.
[19115.07s -> 19116.03s]  I kind of can't.
[19116.03s -> 19118.19s]  My mic is connected to my desk.
[19118.90s -> 19130.05s]  Kind of bolted on.
[19130.05s -> 19131.89s]  Yeah, it's not going anywhere.
[19131.89s -> 19135.81s]  When's the next no cam chill stream?
[19136.94s -> 19138.14s]  I've been doing a lot of those.
[19138.14s -> 19141.86s]  I mean, just kind of base cam and high energy.
[19141.86s -> 19147.20s]  Just sort of whenever I have the energy, I'll do it.
[19147.20s -> 19149.66s]  But yeah, I mean, maybe next stream.
[19149.66s -> 19150.86s]  The next Final Fantasy stream.
[19150.86s -> 19151.26s]  Absolutely.
[19151.26s -> 19155.71s]  We'll just kind of hang out and just have my mouth open.
[19155.71s -> 19156.61s]  Just playing it.
[19156.61s -> 19165.94s]  What demos do you plan on checking out for next best?
[19166.96s -> 19168.48s]  I plan on just going to the popular tab.
[19169.36s -> 19172.32s]  Obviously, also, if you have a recommendation, put it in the Discord.
[19172.32s -> 19174.40s]  The Discord recommendation channel.
[19177.28s -> 19180.86s]  Give it a look.
[19180.86s -> 19184.08s]  If you have one that you think, well, yeah, you really should play that.
[19184.08s -> 19187.12s]  Then throw it in the recommended.
[19187.12s -> 19187.84s]  I'll take a look.
[19187.84s -> 19188.48s]  Add it on the list.
[19188.48s -> 19198.53s]  I plan on just kind of blowing through a dozen of them or so over a few hours.
[19198.53s -> 19199.81s]  But see you later.
[19199.81s -> 19201.54s]  Don't forget the BLT.
[19201.54s -> 19202.34s]  No, I won't.
[19202.34s -> 19208.46s]  I'll take at least one bite of a BLT on Saturday.
[19208.46s -> 19217.76s]  Probably starting around 4 Pacific on Saturday, 4 p.m.
[19217.76s -> 19218.00s]  All right.
[19218.00s -> 19218.88s]  I'll see you later.
[19218.88s -> 19220.37s]  Have a good night.
[19220.37s -> 19223.65s]  Take care of yourselves.
[19223.65s -> 19224.37s]  And goodbye.
