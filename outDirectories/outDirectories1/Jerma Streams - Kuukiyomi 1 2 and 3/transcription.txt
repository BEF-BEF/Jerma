[3.38s -> 7.03s]  Hey, I'm here. Yep. Sorry. I had to take a phone call.
[8.38s -> 10.54s]  I had a phone call. I had to take. I couldn't ignore it.
[13.43s -> 18.66s]  Sorry.
[18.66s -> 20.66s]  Okay. Sorry. I might have to clear my throat.
[22.41s -> 24.41s]  So today, hello. Hi.
[25.94s -> 27.48s]  What's up?
[27.48s -> 29.16s]  Welcome to the stream.
[29.16s -> 33.50s]  Hope you had a good week.
[33.50s -> 35.50s]  I did. I think I had a pretty good week.
[37.53s -> 39.21s]  Here on the weekend now.
[39.21s -> 41.21s]  To hang out with you.
[42.31s -> 44.94s]  And play video games.
[44.94s -> 47.24s]  Aren't you ready?
[47.24s -> 49.24s]  Uh, we have a few things to do this weekend.
[49.94s -> 53.62s]  Today, we're gonna play this game called Considerate.
[54.73s -> 56.97s]  It's a game kind of like WarioWare.
[57.53s -> 59.54s]  I'm really into the micro game stuff right now.
[60.66s -> 63.22s]  The only difference is the choices you make in this game
[64.10s -> 66.10s]  are based on how nice of a person you are.
[66.81s -> 68.41s]  How considerate you are.
[68.41s -> 72.74s]  And to get rated at the end of how considerate of a person you are.
[73.38s -> 76.97s]  Based on the micro games.
[76.97s -> 78.97s]  So I, it looks cool.
[79.98s -> 81.50s]  Resident Sleeper.
[81.50s -> 83.58s]  I was, oh wow, he's gonna scream.
[84.68s -> 86.20s]  One day I will do that.
[86.20s -> 88.12s]  One day I'm gonna see a Resident Sleeper and I'm gonna go
[90.12s -> 92.12s]  Just like scream into the fucking microphone.
[94.49s -> 97.05s]  So that person is, because they just pressed enter.
[99.21s -> 101.77s]  And now it's like, holy shit, I just did Resident Sleeper.
[102.73s -> 104.73s]  And this motherfucker screamed.
[106.36s -> 108.52s]  And I can see it scrolling up the chat.
[109.32s -> 110.28s]  So I was wrong.
[110.28s -> 112.52s]  I'm not, how do I delete my chat room?
[115.70s -> 117.14s]  Oh shit, you're right, thank you.
[117.14s -> 125.29s]  Is this the guy from Bloodwigs?
[126.09s -> 127.13s]  Wait, Bloodwigs, what?
[127.77s -> 130.34s]  Yeah, I'm the guy, I'm the guy that likes to work with Bloodwigs.
[130.90s -> 133.56s]  I'm just, I stream with like another room.
[134.12s -> 137.69s]  Let me tweet.
[145.03s -> 146.63s]  Okay, tweet is out.
[146.63s -> 147.91s]  Now I can talk about what we're doing.
[148.71s -> 151.10s]  Where's my tweet?
[151.74s -> 153.69s]  What the fuck?
[153.69s -> 158.82s]  Here we go, okay, see it.
[161.56s -> 164.15s]  All right, what about Deltarune?
[164.15s -> 164.95s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[164.95s -> 166.63s]  Hey, hold on, let me, let me move the clock.
[166.63s -> 167.59s]  I almost said the clock.
[168.74s -> 169.62s]  It's a microphone.
[170.65s -> 171.69s]  It's not a clock.
[171.69s -> 172.89s]  Let me move the clock.
[172.89s -> 177.40s]  Hold on, there.
[177.40s -> 179.40s]  Let me move the mic closer to my face so I don't have to lean in.
[180.12s -> 181.24s]  So we're going to play Considerate.
[181.24s -> 182.28s]  There's three of them.
[182.28s -> 184.92s]  I think they're both, the three of them are like an hour each.
[185.64s -> 186.76s]  Maybe Considering?
[186.76s -> 187.48s]  I don't know.
[187.48s -> 188.82s]  We're going to do them.
[189.38s -> 191.14s]  I'm going to get bored of them, or maybe not.
[191.70s -> 194.82s]  And if we do get bored, then we're going to move on to Roswell Agent,
[195.54s -> 200.30s]  which is the third person FBI game where you drive around and you're an agent.
[200.94s -> 202.54s]  And it's about an alien invasion.
[203.18s -> 207.80s]  And there's a car in it, so you know how we feel about those.
[210.04s -> 211.96s]  And then I was going to play Deltarune tomorrow,
[212.60s -> 215.16s]  but Deltarune is going to be next weekend,
[215.80s -> 217.83s]  because I want to play Chapter One,
[217.83s -> 221.43s]  because I think it's been a long time between chapters,
[222.23s -> 224.55s]  and I want to make sure I know what the fuck I'm talking about,
[224.55s -> 226.46s]  because I don't remember a goddamn thing.
[226.46s -> 229.02s]  The only thing I remember is I beat that clown.
[229.02s -> 230.86s]  I beat Jevil first try.
[232.06s -> 234.94s]  I don't know anything else, and I kind of want to refresh her.
[234.94s -> 239.58s]  So off stream, I'm going to play Deltarune Chapter One before next weekend,
[239.58s -> 241.58s]  and then obviously we'll do Chapter Two next weekend.
[245.66s -> 249.66s]  Also next weekend, we're finally going to do the Sims 3 modded hell.
[250.38s -> 254.86s]  I have like 10 game changing mods, just like I did in the fourth game.
[254.86s -> 256.46s]  Sims 4, you get the idea.
[257.02s -> 258.30s]  We'll do that next weekend as well.
[258.86s -> 260.86s]  So there's your Friday, Saturday for next weekend.
[261.42s -> 266.79s]  Friday, Saturday for this weekend, however, is going to be this game,
[266.79s -> 271.11s]  the FBI game, and then tomorrow we're going to probably play the pawn shop game.
[272.23s -> 273.27s]  No umbrellas allowed.
[273.27s -> 275.11s]  It's a pawn shop simulator.
[275.75s -> 278.47s]  I think it looks pretty fun.
[280.76s -> 281.64s]  You're going to play Diablo?
[281.64s -> 283.16s]  I'm not going to stream Diablo 2.
[283.16s -> 288.47s]  No, I streamed Diablo 2 earlier last year or the year before.
[289.35s -> 290.31s]  I don't need to do it again.
[294.20s -> 295.00s]  That's pretty based.
[296.63s -> 299.11s]  I just don't think I need to stream it.
[302.22s -> 305.90s]  It's going to be hard for me to even play Diablo 2.
[306.54s -> 309.21s]  There's a lot going on right now.
[311.11s -> 315.03s]  It's not like my days of yesteryear where I would stay up
[315.03s -> 317.19s]  till like four in the morning playing Diablo 2.
[317.91s -> 318.95s]  Like 10 hours.
[319.35s -> 321.75s]  Those days are probably long gone.
[322.31s -> 328.71s]  Especially now with all this kind of stuff going on.
[328.71s -> 329.21s]  Projects.
[332.04s -> 333.56s]  Maybe I'll talk about that at some point.
[334.12s -> 335.75s]  Yeah, let's go.
[335.75s -> 336.15s]  Let's go.
[336.15s -> 340.79s]  I got this game ready.
[340.79s -> 343.35s]  Toby Fox referenced you on the stream?
[344.76s -> 345.80s]  Yeah, I know.
[345.80s -> 346.44s]  It was pretty cool.
[347.08s -> 348.12s]  I didn't even...
[348.12s -> 349.00s]  It's weird.
[349.00s -> 350.92s]  It's weird when somebody that you think is like cool,
[351.96s -> 353.72s]  or like, holy shit, Undertale.
[353.72s -> 355.48s]  Toby Fox, that guy's fucking legendary.
[356.87s -> 358.31s]  Like, he said my name.
[358.87s -> 363.86s]  That's like Brad Pitt saying your name.
[363.86s -> 365.62s]  That's like going to the red carpet
[365.62s -> 367.14s]  and standing there with like a microphone
[367.14s -> 368.58s]  and like waiting for an interview.
[369.30s -> 371.70s]  And Brad Pitt walks by everybody else,
[372.26s -> 375.06s]  makes direct eye contact with you on the red carpet,
[375.06s -> 376.34s]  walks straight up to you and goes,
[377.14s -> 378.39s]  I know you, bro.
[379.90s -> 380.46s]  I know you.
[381.10s -> 381.90s]  And you're like, what the...
[382.86s -> 384.78s]  Hey, Brad Pitt.
[385.42s -> 385.92s]  Yeah.
[386.38s -> 387.18s]  Yeah, I do.
[387.18s -> 389.40s]  Hey, enjoy the movie.
[389.40s -> 390.52s]  And they fucking just keep walking.
[391.45s -> 393.05s]  It's like, holy shit, Brad Pitt.
[393.05s -> 393.93s]  How do you know who I am?
[394.57s -> 398.39s]  You're the worst streamer.
[401.72s -> 402.44s]  Ego Andy.
[404.98s -> 406.26s]  No, not Ego Andy.
[406.26s -> 408.02s]  You didn't even see the movements I was doing.
[408.58s -> 412.46s]  Do you understand the movements I was just making?
[412.46s -> 414.52s]  I was just going like...
[414.52s -> 417.24s]  Okay, I was going like this with the microphone in my hand.
[418.04s -> 419.80s]  Hey, hey, Brad Pitt, how are you?
[419.80s -> 422.92s]  That's not Ego Andy.
[422.92s -> 424.92s]  That's like holy shit, Andy.
[424.92s -> 425.48s]  You know what I mean?
[425.48s -> 427.00s]  That's not Ego Andy.
[427.00s -> 433.03s]  I was shaking.
[433.03s -> 433.83s]  Okay, I'll be honest.
[433.83s -> 434.95s]  When I first opened this,
[434.95s -> 439.11s]  I thought it was an iPhone game that I had to flip up like left.
[439.83s -> 443.91s]  I really thought this was like an iPhone.
[444.63s -> 446.23s]  My orientation is wrong.
[446.23s -> 448.95s]  But no, this is correct.
[449.51s -> 455.42s]  First, I was like, why is my resolution so wrong?
[455.42s -> 457.74s]  Okay, so I think we're ready.
[457.74s -> 459.42s]  I'm ready to play Consider It.
[459.42s -> 460.07s]  Good afternoon.
[460.07s -> 460.63s]  Good afternoon.
[462.28s -> 463.48s]  Go camera again.
[463.48s -> 465.16s]  You'll get it in waves.
[465.16s -> 466.90s]  All right, let's play.
[466.90s -> 467.78s]  Do you want to use the mouse?
[469.51s -> 470.55s]  I don't think I use the mouse.
[471.19s -> 477.08s]  This is a space where you are free to consider things as you like.
[477.08s -> 481.00s]  There is no one here to stop you from being as considerate as you, please.
[481.00s -> 492.02s]  Now what?
[492.02s -> 492.98s]  After considering the...
[493.86s -> 495.46s]  That was me holding a burp back.
[496.02s -> 500.52s]  After considering the situation, move the red object on the screen.
[500.52s -> 502.52s]  Sometimes there may be nothing to move.
[502.52s -> 505.16s]  Just do what you consider the appropriate action.
[505.16s -> 508.60s]  If you wish to stop playing, just push the escape key.
[508.60s -> 509.72s]  It's too bright.
[509.72s -> 510.04s]  I don't...
[510.04s -> 510.52s]  What am I...
[510.52s -> 513.66s]  I can't fix that.
[513.66s -> 515.10s]  All right, number one.
[515.10s -> 516.57s]  The first thing to consider.
[522.52s -> 524.74s]  Together.
[524.74s -> 525.30s]  Oh, okay.
[530.41s -> 535.45s]  I wasn't going to move for those people.
[535.45s -> 536.33s]  Elementary dominoes.
[536.33s -> 537.69s]  Let's set a world record.
[537.69s -> 539.93s]  Okay.
[539.93s -> 548.15s]  I feel like I'm doing like a psychology test.
[548.15s -> 552.70s]  Down, boy.
[552.70s -> 553.34s]  I did it.
[553.34s -> 558.52s]  The wobble filter hurts my head.
[558.52s -> 559.96s]  Yeah, how do I turn that off?
[559.96s -> 560.76s]  In Tokyo.
[561.40s -> 563.30s]  Oh, someone's behind us.
[564.58s -> 566.10s]  Yeah, you're going to move out of the way.
[566.10s -> 567.06s]  Somebody, you don't want to...
[567.06s -> 567.78s]  If you're going to stand there.
[567.78s -> 569.78s]  If somebody wants to walk up the escalator, you got to let them pass.
[573.83s -> 575.03s]  Okay, I'm going to go here.
[575.03s -> 581.58s]  Is it going to reveal you?
[582.14s -> 583.91s]  You're moderately considerate.
[583.91s -> 587.19s]  I did everything that anyone should do in those situations.
[589.69s -> 591.85s]  I'm incredibly considerate.
[591.85s -> 596.54s]  Wait, this is going to keep going.
[596.54s -> 600.41s]  Does this get harder?
[600.41s -> 600.91s]  Santa.
[601.53s -> 604.20s]  Oh, I had to put my head down.
[607.78s -> 608.28s]  Okay.
[609.30s -> 613.56s]  What?
[613.56s -> 614.60s]  Can I take your order?
[615.24s -> 619.50s]  I know this fucking wobble filter is freaking me out.
[619.50s -> 620.14s]  Cocktails.
[620.14s -> 620.86s]  I would want a...
[623.19s -> 623.69s]  Okay.
[624.39s -> 626.47s]  I'm going to rate these on a scale of one to ten.
[628.01s -> 628.51s]  Eight.
[629.38s -> 630.82s]  Okay, no, I don't want a white Russian.
[633.45s -> 635.42s]  Did I pick a white Russian?
[636.06s -> 639.45s]  What am I supposed to do?
[640.25s -> 642.71s]  I just pressed a button.
[642.71s -> 643.51s]  What button did I press?
[645.05s -> 645.69s]  A, B, C?
[646.33s -> 650.81s]  What happened?
[650.81s -> 658.34s]  A, B, A, B, B.
[660.23s -> 661.43s]  Am I not saying words?
[661.43s -> 661.91s]  How do I...
[661.91s -> 663.27s]  I visit space bar?
[663.27s -> 668.23s]  If I get this last pin, you'll go out with me.
[668.23s -> 668.87s]  Yeah, okay.
[669.67s -> 674.14s]  Wait, what?
[674.86s -> 676.22s]  That thing's on a fucking string.
[682.58s -> 686.94s]  That thing was pulled in some way or another considerate.
[686.94s -> 688.14s]  I didn't even do anything.
[688.14s -> 692.42s]  You didn't get on a date.
[692.42s -> 697.70s]  Well, I was supposed to knock the inconsiderate Andy.
[697.70s -> 698.10s]  I didn't do...
[698.10s -> 698.82s]  What did I do wrong?
[699.45s -> 702.79s]  How many levels are there?
[702.79s -> 703.91s]  Okay, cans and bottles.
[704.55s -> 706.25s]  I have to break these?
[708.71s -> 712.65s]  Oh, I can jump.
[712.65s -> 713.93s]  Is this considerate?
[713.93s -> 715.45s]  I'm destroying recycling, right?
[715.45s -> 716.73s]  Am I breaking it down?
[716.73s -> 720.25s]  I'm confused.
[720.25s -> 722.65s]  I am too.
[722.65s -> 726.14s]  Stand.
[726.14s -> 729.72s]  Oh, seat.
[729.72s -> 731.08s]  Okay, I did all three of them.
[731.08s -> 738.07s]  Is this a puzzle?
[738.07s -> 739.27s]  Let's go to the zoo.
[739.27s -> 741.03s]  Okay, me and girlfriend.
[741.03s -> 741.99s]  Sensor, the lines are...
[742.63s -> 745.69s]  Wait, oh, I probably...
[745.69s -> 748.42s]  I mean, you would do the same thing though, right?
[748.42s -> 750.42s]  There's no way anybody could tell me.
[751.06s -> 751.54s]  Hold on.
[751.54s -> 752.42s]  We got to talk about this.
[752.42s -> 752.82s]  Tap, tap.
[752.82s -> 753.38s]  There's a ghost.
[754.02s -> 758.06s]  If there are two lions having sex at the zoo,
[759.27s -> 760.15s]  what, are you going to leave?
[763.75s -> 765.03s]  Every single person is going to be like,
[765.03s -> 765.75s]  what the fuck?
[765.75s -> 766.15s]  Oh, wow.
[766.95s -> 767.99s]  What's going on?
[768.87s -> 772.62s]  You're going to like turn away and leave.
[772.62s -> 778.42s]  All right, I did the wave with everybody.
[778.42s -> 783.22s]  Moderately considerate.
[783.22s -> 786.01s]  Okay, there are like three buttons.
[786.01s -> 787.61s]  There's up, down, left, right, and space.
[787.61s -> 789.05s]  From what I'm understanding here.
[789.05s -> 792.47s]  You went right up to it.
[792.47s -> 796.31s]  So I guess it would be inconsiderate.
[796.31s -> 803.02s]  Oh, well.
[803.02s -> 803.50s]  Wait, what?
[804.06s -> 806.30s]  No, I was trying to walk with the character.
[806.38s -> 807.26s]  Was that considerate?
[809.53s -> 811.13s]  Why would putting your umbrella down
[811.13s -> 812.57s]  be considerate in the rain?
[812.57s -> 814.01s]  That's you getting rained on.
[814.01s -> 819.94s]  Oh man, I got to get off at the next stop.
[819.94s -> 820.90s]  Doki, doki.
[821.70s -> 823.08s]  Oh, great.
[823.08s -> 824.28s]  This is the final stop.
[824.28s -> 825.56s]  Carano Bus Terminal.
[825.56s -> 829.13s]  All right, so get off.
[833.90s -> 834.70s]  I got off.
[834.70s -> 838.73s]  What's boyfriend and girlfriend here?
[838.73s -> 843.30s]  Okay, I'm going to sit down.
[843.30s -> 845.30s]  What?
[845.30s -> 845.94s]  What?
[845.94s -> 848.90s]  There was enough room.
[848.90s -> 849.86s]  Today is our date.
[850.58s -> 853.06s]  Okay, Robocon or RomCon.
[855.98s -> 857.58s]  Let's go to Robocon.
[858.38s -> 861.45s]  I think we both would enjoy that.
[861.45s -> 868.44s]  It's still our date.
[868.44s -> 869.00s]  Okay.
[869.00s -> 870.44s]  What am I supposed to do?
[870.44s -> 871.24s]  Oh, walk on this side.
[871.24s -> 873.80s]  So nobody splashes her?
[873.80s -> 877.61s]  I don't know.
[877.61s -> 885.10s]  And somewhere or another considerate.
[885.10s -> 885.34s]  What?
[885.34s -> 890.55s]  Did I not raise my hand to say I need to get off?
[890.55s -> 892.07s]  Robocon is...
[892.07s -> 893.27s]  Wait, what does that mean?
[893.27s -> 894.07s]  Does that mean something?
[900.12s -> 902.28s]  You have to do it based on Japanese culture?
[902.84s -> 903.80s]  Good morning.
[903.80s -> 904.92s]  Oh, shit, his head.
[904.92s -> 906.71s]  No, no, pick it up.
[907.43s -> 908.39s]  No, don't look.
[908.39s -> 909.03s]  Don't look.
[909.03s -> 909.35s]  You don't...
[910.47s -> 916.58s]  Japanese samurai is weaker than great elderly.
[916.58s -> 922.92s]  Okay.
[922.92s -> 923.16s]  Um...
[924.12s -> 926.76s]  They have no options to do anything.
[927.32s -> 930.68s]  Oh, I got to walk with her.
[930.68s -> 932.04s]  Don't walk too fast.
[932.04s -> 940.94s]  Why would I walk in front of her?
[940.94s -> 946.02s]  Today is another date.
[946.02s -> 947.70s]  I guess we could think of them as a couple now.
[947.70s -> 948.34s]  Okay.
[948.34s -> 952.04s]  They were heading towards an anime
[952.04s -> 953.96s]  when suddenly they turned towards a romance movie.
[953.96s -> 955.64s]  He seems really naive.
[955.64s -> 957.16s]  He builds up his courage and takes her hand.
[957.16s -> 958.60s]  It seems like they are really dating now.
[968.66s -> 973.19s]  Oh, what you don't know is when you looked over,
[973.19s -> 974.39s]  he was sleeping.
[974.39s -> 977.66s]  No, keep walking.
[977.66s -> 978.38s]  You don't just walk.
[978.38s -> 978.94s]  Just go by.
[978.94s -> 985.34s]  You don't have to sit there and stare at anybody.
[985.34s -> 986.94s]  In some way or another, consider it.
[986.94s -> 987.82s]  Yeah, but I don't even know...
[988.70s -> 989.26s]  I couldn't...
[989.26s -> 990.14s]  I pressed every button.
[990.14s -> 991.90s]  I couldn't like swing the sword at that guy.
[991.90s -> 998.52s]  You'll stare at the zoo animal.
[998.52s -> 999.24s]  Okay.
[999.24s -> 999.80s]  I want...
[999.80s -> 1000.36s]  I want to take...
[1000.36s -> 1001.24s]  Hold on.
[1001.24s -> 1002.04s]  So you have...
[1002.04s -> 1004.12s]  So who have we got for the yellow ranger?
[1004.12s -> 1006.04s]  What's...
[1006.04s -> 1008.33s]  I don't get it.
[1008.33s -> 1009.05s]  Me?
[1009.05s -> 1012.47s]  Did I not have raised my hand?
[1012.47s -> 1020.38s]  Did I do it?
[1020.38s -> 1021.10s]  I got it.
[1021.10s -> 1025.06s]  What's the max grade?
[1025.06s -> 1025.54s]  I don't know.
[1026.42s -> 1028.36s]  Is that the guy from South Park?
[1032.28s -> 1037.40s]  Why is that the South Park Warcraft guy?
[1037.40s -> 1038.20s]  Okay.
[1038.20s -> 1040.73s]  Why is he so sweaty?
[1042.33s -> 1043.85s]  Hey, I got my personality test back.
[1043.85s -> 1044.41s]  You want to see?
[1044.41s -> 1045.29s]  Let's see what you got.
[1047.24s -> 1050.28s]  My personality is looking at animals?
[1054.78s -> 1058.60s]  How do I exit?
[1058.60s -> 1059.96s]  Wait, is that what's on my mind?
[1059.96s -> 1061.16s]  That's weird.
[1061.16s -> 1069.70s]  Turn right.
[1069.70s -> 1070.26s]  Okay.
[1070.26s -> 1072.26s]  I feel like that's not a good thing.
[1073.35s -> 1074.71s]  In some way or another.
[1081.29s -> 1083.53s]  There's probably like four letters or four grades.
[1083.53s -> 1084.41s]  This is me.
[1084.41s -> 1086.71s]  Barber or bar?
[1086.71s -> 1087.43s]  I don't have any hair.
[1089.34s -> 1089.98s]  Why would I go...
[1090.54s -> 1091.58s]  I don't have hair.
[1091.58s -> 1099.19s]  I missed.
[1099.19s -> 1100.31s]  I didn't know that's what I was supposed to do.
[1102.73s -> 1105.13s]  You know what really is really fucking inconsiderate?
[1105.77s -> 1108.89s]  Sliding a drink down a wet slippery bar
[1109.61s -> 1111.69s]  and expecting your friends to catch it.
[1111.69s -> 1112.81s]  So that was on him, not me.
[1112.81s -> 1116.65s]  That was inconsiderate on them.
[1116.65s -> 1117.13s]  Oh, fuck.
[1117.13s -> 1117.77s]  I struck out.
[1128.84s -> 1129.80s]  Wait, why is it...
[1129.80s -> 1130.28s]  Oh, wait.
[1130.28s -> 1131.80s]  I'm supposed to let him do that.
[1131.80s -> 1137.53s]  Down to my last ball.
[1137.53s -> 1139.37s]  This is my last chance.
[1139.37s -> 1143.82s]  Was I supposed to not block that?
[1144.54s -> 1145.74s]  Oh, he's catching me.
[1145.74s -> 1147.42s]  He's catching the monster.
[1147.42s -> 1152.76s]  In some way or another.
[1154.47s -> 1155.27s]  That means bad.
[1155.27s -> 1163.30s]  There's a lot...
[1163.30s -> 1164.10s]  Okay, 36.
[1164.10s -> 1165.22s]  We're just still going.
[1165.22s -> 1170.31s]  I didn't know what button jump was.
[1170.31s -> 1171.67s]  I pressed up and it wasn't that.
[1172.55s -> 1177.14s]  What do I do?
[1179.22s -> 1180.18s]  I don't know what that is.
[1180.18s -> 1182.02s]  I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[1182.02s -> 1187.66s]  Why am I scheming?
[1189.56s -> 1190.12s]  He missed.
[1192.47s -> 1194.63s]  How do I move in those scenarios?
[1194.63s -> 1196.57s]  Is there another button I'm not pressing?
[1197.13s -> 1201.66s]  Okay, this guy...
[1201.66s -> 1202.46s]  Let him sleep on me.
[1209.61s -> 1210.65s]  But is it in...
[1210.65s -> 1211.37s]  Okay.
[1211.37s -> 1215.62s]  When I say you, clap your hands.
[1215.62s -> 1218.46s]  Did I get it?
[1218.46s -> 1223.50s]  And somewhere...
[1223.50s -> 1224.54s]  I think I'm missing a button.
[1226.18s -> 1229.38s]  I have up, down, left, right on the arrow keys.
[1229.38s -> 1230.10s]  And I have space.
[1230.10s -> 1231.38s]  And sometimes I can't move anybody.
[1242.79s -> 1251.00s]  Wait, am I supposed to be moving them?
[1251.00s -> 1261.13s]  I can't believe I'm actually going to meet AA in person.
[1261.13s -> 1262.25s]  I know I get it.
[1262.25s -> 1263.85s]  Okay, BB is nobody there.
[1263.85s -> 1264.97s]  But like I wanted to come...
[1264.97s -> 1267.51s]  I came here to see AA.
[1267.51s -> 1275.77s]  Oh, I don't have very much time.
[1275.77s -> 1277.37s]  Oh, you get that mushroom so you can get bigger.
[1278.57s -> 1280.44s]  Well, I didn't want you to...
[1280.44s -> 1282.18s]  Okay, we're good.
[1282.18s -> 1283.22s]  I got two lives now.
[1283.22s -> 1285.51s]  What if it was a poison mushroom?
[1293.82s -> 1294.86s]  No, take the picture.
[1295.90s -> 1297.02s]  I tried to press space.
[1297.02s -> 1298.06s]  It didn't do anything.
[1298.06s -> 1300.55s]  Some of these don't work.
[1301.91s -> 1303.91s]  Is it just me or is it cold in here?
[1303.91s -> 1304.55s]  Got it.
[1304.55s -> 1306.12s]  Temperature.
[1313.10s -> 1314.54s]  We'll turn the heat up a little.
[1314.54s -> 1319.58s]  And somewhere in there, consider it.
[1321.56s -> 1322.04s]  A little?
[1322.04s -> 1322.92s]  What do you mean?
[1322.92s -> 1325.64s]  30 Celsius, Jesus Christ, is what?
[1325.64s -> 1327.30s]  Is it 100 degrees?
[1327.94s -> 1328.66s]  Shit.
[1328.66s -> 1333.22s]  I have so much trouble with Celsius because like
[1333.22s -> 1335.62s]  one or two degrees is something completely different.
[1336.34s -> 1347.85s]  Am I trying to block this guy from reading?
[1347.85s -> 1348.81s]  Oh, okay.
[1348.81s -> 1353.40s]  If I lose, that's considerate.
[1353.40s -> 1354.20s]  Hey, I'm thirsty.
[1355.08s -> 1355.72s]  Okay, got it.
[1355.72s -> 1356.76s]  She's like burning up.
[1356.76s -> 1358.28s]  All right, give me a coffee.
[1358.28s -> 1359.08s]  All right, coffee.
[1359.88s -> 1360.60s]  I'll take one.
[1361.48s -> 1368.41s]  But that's a hot coffee.
[1368.41s -> 1380.57s]  Oh, I was trying to...
[1381.93s -> 1382.97s]  All right, first of all, I'll be honest.
[1382.97s -> 1384.17s]  I was trying to drop it on the floor.
[1384.17s -> 1385.22s]  I'll be honest.
[1385.22s -> 1388.23s]  TV special, witness the power.
[1393.59s -> 1396.92s]  Oh, that would be inconsiderate.
[1396.92s -> 1398.28s]  I'm just seeing what my options are.
[1399.54s -> 1401.46s]  I'm just trying to see what it's even possible.
[1406.68s -> 1407.96s]  Psycho, psycho, psycho.
[1407.96s -> 1409.56s]  No, okay, I'm sorry.
[1409.56s -> 1410.20s]  I have to really...
[1410.20s -> 1411.72s]  I'm going to have to defend myself on this here.
[1413.48s -> 1414.04s]  What am I doing?
[1416.15s -> 1417.67s]  Be looking at somebody?
[1417.67s -> 1418.71s]  What should we be looking at?
[1418.71s -> 1419.27s]  Straight ahead?
[1423.50s -> 1425.66s]  You need to know what your tools are capable of doing, okay?
[1427.32s -> 1428.76s]  Oh, look, we need a spot.
[1432.07s -> 1433.83s]  No, I was trying at first to get a spot.
[1433.83s -> 1434.95s]  Not me take a spot.
[1437.67s -> 1438.47s]  Speed.
[1438.47s -> 1450.12s]  I thought it was us walking.
[1450.12s -> 1451.24s]  Big bro, I'm so hungry.
[1451.24s -> 1453.24s]  Big bro has to do something.
[1453.24s -> 1455.29s]  Ghost leg competition final.
[1455.29s -> 1456.81s]  The winner gets all you can eat.
[1456.81s -> 1458.42s]  Bra or don't draw.
[1458.42s -> 1459.14s]  It's up to you.
[1459.14s -> 1459.86s]  The last line.
[1460.50s -> 1462.34s]  You, big bro, winner.
[1462.34s -> 1462.84s]  What?
[1463.30s -> 1468.22s]  How do I draw?
[1468.78s -> 1470.50s]  How do I do this?
[1470.50s -> 1471.38s]  Control?
[1471.38s -> 1471.70s]  Alt?
[1473.82s -> 1474.22s]  Enter?
[1474.94s -> 1475.98s]  Hold the mouse button down?
[1478.62s -> 1479.82s]  I can't draw anything.
[1479.82s -> 1483.75s]  You need to put a controller in?
[1489.59s -> 1490.47s]  I didn't have any controls.
[1495.59s -> 1497.03s]  I don't think you can even look at the control.
[1497.03s -> 1499.96s]  Keyboard and mouse?
[1499.96s -> 1509.86s]  Hey, why don't we check that personality test again?
[1509.86s -> 1510.90s]  Quick, hit escape.
[1511.93s -> 1513.29s]  Hit escape quick.
[1513.29s -> 1514.81s]  Why am I trying to hit escape?
[1514.81s -> 1520.07s]  What, did I have like a porn hub tab open?
[1520.07s -> 1521.11s]  I don't understand.
[1521.11s -> 1522.31s]  Why was I freaking out?
[1522.31s -> 1523.67s]  Are you even listening?
[1523.67s -> 1524.39s]  Yes, I am.
[1524.39s -> 1527.42s]  Do you think I've get-
[1527.42s -> 1527.92s]  No!
[1530.74s -> 1531.78s]  That's what I-
[1531.78s -> 1532.34s]  What?
[1532.34s -> 1533.14s]  Are you listening?
[1533.14s -> 1533.78s]  I'm listening.
[1533.78s -> 1534.34s]  I'm listening.
[1534.34s -> 1534.58s]  I am.
[1534.58s -> 1535.54s]  I swear to God.
[1535.54s -> 1537.86s]  It'd be so much better to be on the other side.
[1537.86s -> 1538.66s]  I'm listening.
[1539.62s -> 1541.54s]  How do I stand the character up?
[1541.54s -> 1547.26s]  Turn the volume down.
[1547.90s -> 1558.92s]  Today is premium Friday.
[1558.92s -> 1562.90s]  Premium Friday.
[1562.90s -> 1563.78s]  Leave at 15.
[1564.34s -> 1568.86s]  Okay.
[1569.74s -> 1570.24s]  Leave.
[1571.02s -> 1571.90s]  Everybody leave.
[1571.90s -> 1573.18s]  Everybody fucking leave.
[1573.18s -> 1573.66s]  Leave.
[1573.66s -> 1574.38s]  You don't have to work anymore.
[1574.38s -> 1574.88s]  Leave.
[1575.66s -> 1576.06s]  Leave.
[1576.06s -> 1576.70s]  All of you leave.
[1576.70s -> 1577.58s]  It's time to go home.
[1577.58s -> 1578.78s]  How do I say go home?
[1578.78s -> 1580.46s]  You were here for like four extra hours.
[1580.46s -> 1584.55s]  Today is our date.
[1584.55s -> 1585.27s]  Why does she have-
[1586.07s -> 1586.87s]  Wait a second.
[1590.50s -> 1592.66s]  Am I dating a cow?
[1597.59s -> 1598.31s]  What was that?
[1598.95s -> 1604.89s]  Wait, that's beef?
[1606.76s -> 1607.56s]  I didn't-
[1607.56s -> 1608.60s]  I thought the sushi-
[1608.60s -> 1609.16s]  Okay.
[1609.16s -> 1609.48s]  Let me-
[1609.48s -> 1610.28s]  Hear me out.
[1610.28s -> 1612.20s]  I thought sushi was meat.
[1612.20s -> 1613.72s]  And I didn't know what the other thing was.
[1614.20s -> 1627.16s]  I was unconcerned.
[1627.16s -> 1627.96s]  I'm taking too much.
[1633.99s -> 1636.07s]  I get thrown out of the restaurant at this point.
[1636.07s -> 1638.73s]  You thought sushi was meat?
[1639.93s -> 1640.97s]  Sushi is meat.
[1642.66s -> 1643.14s]  I-
[1643.14s -> 1644.18s]  You just did it!
[1644.18s -> 1645.54s]  You can't change the rules.
[1645.54s -> 1648.70s]  What do you mean sushi is not meat?
[1648.70s -> 1651.02s]  What do you think it is?
[1651.02s -> 1653.10s]  Waiting for your bento to heat up.
[1654.66s -> 1655.22s]  Um, okay.
[1655.22s -> 1655.94s]  How much does it cost?
[1656.50s -> 1656.74s]  All right.
[1656.74s -> 1658.34s]  So you can go ahead of me because I'm waiting for my-
[1658.34s -> 1659.14s]  You can just go ahead of me.
[1660.02s -> 1660.63s]  Yeah.
[1660.63s -> 1661.11s]  That's what I do.
[1661.11s -> 1661.91s]  If I was like I could look,
[1661.91s -> 1663.83s]  I'm gonna be like probably another two minutes or so.
[1663.83s -> 1664.71s]  Yeah, that's considerate.
[1672.46s -> 1673.42s]  No buttons do anything.
[1673.98s -> 1676.78s]  Let me hear you make some noise.
[1678.70s -> 1679.74s]  Oh, okay.
[1679.74s -> 1681.50s]  I think I've given certain love and peace.
[1685.77s -> 1686.89s]  Yes, we cannot.
[1687.53s -> 1689.05s]  Cannot what?
[1689.29s -> 1691.69s]  I don't know what I'm agreeing to as a collective audience.
[1698.42s -> 1699.30s]  Today is our date.
[1699.30s -> 1700.26s]  Okay, this is a robot.
[1700.26s -> 1702.02s]  All right, we're gonna go to Robocon.
[1702.02s -> 1709.93s]  Is that what I should have done?
[1709.93s -> 1710.17s]  Mod-
[1710.17s -> 1711.53s]  Okay, that was better than last time.
[1711.53s -> 1712.57s]  Moderately considerate.
[1717.66s -> 1718.06s]  Gundam.
[1729.53s -> 1729.93s]  There we go.
[1729.93s -> 1737.29s]  Okay.
[1737.29s -> 1737.93s]  Moderately-
[1737.93s -> 1738.57s]  First in line.
[1738.57s -> 1740.57s]  Okay, please ride the robots in order.
[1741.37s -> 1742.95s]  I don't know-
[1742.95s -> 1743.27s]  What?
[1746.79s -> 1747.75s]  Oh, that one's broken.
[1752.66s -> 1752.98s]  Help!
[1755.51s -> 1755.99s]  Help!
[1755.99s -> 1756.47s]  Okay, help.
[1757.35s -> 1757.75s]  Ally.
[1767.24s -> 1779.18s]  Shut up.
[1779.18s -> 1779.74s]  Let him get it.
[1782.65s -> 1787.37s]  Yeah, like, look, I'm not gonna get in the middle of two, like, cowboys, okay?
[1787.93s -> 1791.06s]  Those are two Red Dead Redemption characters.
[1791.06s -> 1792.42s]  I'm gonna grab the drink in the middle.
[1792.42s -> 1793.22s]  That's not considerate.
[1793.22s -> 1795.38s]  That's called survival.
[1795.38s -> 1796.02s]  I'm just-
[1796.02s -> 1801.34s]  I'm not getting involved with that one.
[1801.34s -> 1802.06s]  You can do it.
[1803.37s -> 1811.85s]  Oh, close that.
[1811.85s -> 1813.21s]  Why is there no food in our pot?
[1813.21s -> 1813.93s]  We need to be patient.
[1813.93s -> 1814.73s]  Something will arrive.
[1820.02s -> 1821.54s]  Okay, how the fuck are you supposed to do?
[1821.54s -> 1822.26s]  I didn't want to eat that.
[1823.54s -> 1825.14s]  How are you supposed to do that?
[1825.14s -> 1836.30s]  I think-
[1836.30s -> 1837.66s]  Okay, I got what they were looking for.
[1838.30s -> 1840.47s]  This is not even considerate.
[1840.47s -> 1841.75s]  It's just remembering the routine.
[1844.81s -> 1845.85s]  I've got a date tomorrow.
[1845.85s -> 1847.77s]  Tomorrow's exam could affect my whole life.
[1847.77s -> 1848.97s]  Tomorrow's the big day.
[1848.97s -> 1850.33s]  Live at the Bucadab-
[1850.33s -> 1851.13s]  Buc-
[1851.13s -> 1851.93s]  Typhoon.
[1851.93s -> 1852.17s]  What?
[1853.13s -> 1855.83s]  Why would I-
[1857.02s -> 1858.38s]  Why would I have let that go?
[1859.18s -> 1862.84s]  It's always been my dream to be saved by a handsome prince riding on a horse.
[1866.36s -> 1866.84s]  Evil ca-
[1866.84s -> 1867.56s]  Wait.
[1867.56s -> 1868.20s]  Evil ca-
[1868.84s -> 1869.48s]  What should I do?
[1870.12s -> 1871.00s]  Go to the race-
[1871.00s -> 1871.80s]  The race course?
[1878.98s -> 1879.70s]  No, wrong.
[1881.88s -> 1886.58s]  So I was going to just go into the evil castle.
[1886.90s -> 1893.56s]  Shouldn't I just go hang out and meet somebody at the horse track thing?
[1893.56s -> 1898.65s]  I'm going to go walk up to Bowser's castle, knock on the door, and be like,
[1898.65s -> 1900.01s]  I'm going to wait for Mario.
[1900.01s -> 1901.59s]  Why would I do that?
[1901.59s -> 1909.32s]  Well, I guess in the later games, in Mario games.
[1909.96s -> 1912.02s]  Isn't Bowser not even a factor anymore?
[1912.74s -> 1916.58s]  Is he still doing that?
[1916.58s -> 1926.04s]  Is Bowser still like-
[1926.04s -> 1927.05s]  No.
[1927.05s -> 1928.01s]  Pay attention.
[1928.01s -> 1928.97s]  Costume competition.
[1932.73s -> 1934.87s]  I won.
[1934.87s -> 1936.87s]  He's in the new game, Mario Odyssey.
[1936.87s -> 1937.19s]  Is he?
[1942.46s -> 1943.34s]  Okay.
[1943.34s -> 1944.46s]  Don't push me.
[1944.46s -> 1945.90s]  Stunt on a comedy show.
[1945.90s -> 1947.26s]  What the fuck is this?
[1947.90s -> 1948.70s]  Don't push me.
[1948.70s -> 1949.74s]  I'm not going to push you.
[1953.21s -> 1953.45s]  Okay.
[1953.45s -> 1953.93s]  I'm not-
[1953.93s -> 1955.85s]  What the fuck is going on?
[1957.42s -> 1958.14s]  Not even hot.
[1958.86s -> 1960.55s]  I have to like-
[1961.43s -> 1962.55s]  Oh, it's crazy.
[1962.55s -> 1962.79s]  It's-
[1962.79s -> 1963.83s]  I'm real hot here.
[1964.55s -> 1972.41s]  Eye witness.
[1975.46s -> 1976.02s]  Oh, okay.
[1976.02s -> 1976.18s]  Is it-
[1976.18s -> 1976.66s]  We're going to blur-
[1976.66s -> 1977.62s]  We have to blur her.
[1982.14s -> 1982.62s]  Don't try-
[1982.62s -> 1983.90s]  In some way or another, consider it.
[1984.46s -> 1985.54s]  Push him.
[1985.54s -> 1986.66s]  It's comedy.
[1986.66s -> 1987.62s]  Oh yeah.
[1987.62s -> 1990.74s]  Somebody's literally begging me not to push them in something.
[1990.74s -> 1993.53s]  Yeah, but comedy show.
[1994.01s -> 1995.29s]  What is that supposed to mean?
[1995.29s -> 2000.10s]  And for the celebrity first pitch, Miss BB.
[2000.74s -> 2010.28s]  That looked bad.
[2010.28s -> 2013.93s]  I'll be honest, I was trying to hit it out of the park.
[2013.93s -> 2015.85s]  I was trying to embarrass BB.
[2015.85s -> 2021.88s]  Here we go.
[2022.76s -> 2023.40s]  I got it.
[2023.40s -> 2027.32s]  Remember, you'd be bad at improv.
[2027.32s -> 2029.83s]  He's telling me not to.
[2029.83s -> 2031.83s]  No, this is how considerate are you?
[2031.83s -> 2035.19s]  And dumping somebody into like a burning hot cauldron is not-
[2035.19s -> 2036.15s]  I didn't know what the hell I was-
[2036.79s -> 2037.51s]  What are you talking about?
[2038.07s -> 2039.61s]  We have to be safe.
[2041.13s -> 2041.77s]  No, no, no.
[2041.77s -> 2042.17s]  Put it back down.
[2042.17s -> 2043.13s]  Put it back down.
[2043.13s -> 2047.08s]  It's a comedy bit.
[2047.08s -> 2048.60s]  I didn't know I was on a comedy show
[2048.60s -> 2058.12s]  until five seconds into that.
[2058.12s -> 2060.57s]  Uh, did I do it too early?
[2060.57s -> 2065.98s]  It said comedy show on the bottom.
[2066.54s -> 2068.10s]  Textbook.
[2069.69s -> 2070.89s]  Should I not look?
[2070.89s -> 2073.43s]  I think that's like where my eyes are looking.
[2073.43s -> 2075.32s]  So I'm gonna like look over here.
[2076.65s -> 2077.37s]  Right?
[2077.37s -> 2084.58s]  No, you look at the book.
[2085.14s -> 2087.10s]  Yeah, all right.
[2087.10s -> 2089.18s]  I'm like looking over at like a poster.
[2097.66s -> 2098.46s]  Oh, seatbelt.
[2099.02s -> 2109.61s]  Why are people calling you psycho?
[2109.61s -> 2110.41s]  I don't know.
[2110.41s -> 2113.42s]  Anyone know the answer?
[2117.96s -> 2118.60s]  You do.
[2118.60s -> 2141.38s]  Oh, but look, there's a spaceship over there.
[2141.38s -> 2152.10s]  Don't be distracted.
[2152.10s -> 2154.17s]  Me and then a couple.
[2154.17s -> 2156.89s]  Oh, I like sacrifice myself to get abducted.
[2156.89s -> 2169.64s]  Or yes, hand up.
[2169.64s -> 2174.52s]  Or no, hand down.
[2174.52s -> 2178.34s]  Answer if don't want world destroyed.
[2178.34s -> 2178.98s]  What?
[2178.98s -> 2180.66s]  Answer if don't you is human?
[2181.30s -> 2181.94s]  Yes.
[2181.94s -> 2183.62s]  Answer if don't want world destroyed.
[2183.62s -> 2184.50s]  Yes or no?
[2184.50s -> 2186.28s]  Don't want the earth destroyed.
[2186.28s -> 2187.88s]  No, I don't want the earth destroyed.
[2187.88s -> 2189.00s]  But don't want the earth-
[2189.00s -> 2189.96s]  I don't no-
[2189.96s -> 2192.28s]  Don't not want the earth not destroyed.
[2192.28s -> 2194.55s]  Put the hand down.
[2194.55s -> 2197.27s]  Tomorrow of today's day before yesterday's three days ago.
[2198.73s -> 2200.49s]  I can't even put my hand back down.
[2200.49s -> 2201.45s]  You lose weight?
[2201.45s -> 2202.33s]  Yes, apparently.
[2204.63s -> 2205.67s]  You see here?
[2205.67s -> 2209.61s]  I can't put my hand down.
[2209.61s -> 2210.65s]  You secret keep?
[2214.62s -> 2215.82s]  You have itchy spots?
[2216.46s -> 2218.50s]  Yes, I don't know.
[2218.50s -> 2219.38s]  I can't put my hand down.
[2220.02s -> 2221.78s]  You hero, you save world?
[2222.84s -> 2226.63s]  Yes, I can't put my hand down.
[2226.63s -> 2241.88s]  Was it escape?
[2241.88s -> 2242.36s]  Telephone.
[2242.36s -> 2243.08s]  Help, save me.
[2243.88s -> 2247.58s]  What's happening?
[2247.58s -> 2248.06s]  Save me?
[2251.21s -> 2256.63s]  Oh, I had to look away because he was changing to turn into a superhero.
[2256.63s -> 2259.27s]  I get it.
[2259.43s -> 2260.23s]  Okay, so we're just talking.
[2260.79s -> 2261.51s]  Somebody wants to-
[2261.51s -> 2262.39s]  All right, somebody wants to get up.
[2263.19s -> 2263.83s]  Let them go.
[2264.55s -> 2273.54s]  Discussion, future of the band, break up or vocal solo debut?
[2276.68s -> 2277.40s]  Oh, shit.
[2277.40s -> 2279.80s]  Okay, that was just me walking by it.
[2279.80s -> 2290.86s]  Okay, consider it.
[2291.50s -> 2294.62s]  All right, we got an important announcement for all of you.
[2295.26s -> 2299.77s]  My grandma suddenly passed away.
[2299.77s -> 2301.21s]  Oh, that's not-
[2301.21s -> 2301.77s]  I don't-
[2301.77s -> 2302.25s]  I'm not gonna-
[2303.05s -> 2305.05s]  We're gonna break up after today.
[2305.05s -> 2306.09s]  Okay, we don't cheer.
[2308.06s -> 2311.67s]  And what else you got?
[2311.67s -> 2312.23s]  Oh, okay.
[2312.23s -> 2319.64s]  Well, I was waiting for the other one.
[2319.64s -> 2320.12s]  Oh, fuck.
[2320.12s -> 2320.60s]  I'm sorry.
[2322.04s -> 2324.54s]  What's considerate here?
[2324.54s -> 2325.42s]  I don't know.
[2325.42s -> 2328.81s]  How do I get you to get up?
[2330.79s -> 2331.67s]  That wasn't considerate.
[2335.61s -> 2337.37s]  Very vaguely considerate.
[2343.35s -> 2344.15s]  Top right corner.
[2344.15s -> 2345.91s]  Could I have clicked it with the mouse?
[2345.91s -> 2346.47s]  I couldn't move.
[2346.47s -> 2347.43s]  I couldn't walk around.
[2347.43s -> 2352.68s]  You're a horrible person.
[2354.33s -> 2355.77s]  And today, I'm definitely gonna get-
[2355.77s -> 2356.01s]  What?
[2356.57s -> 2369.21s]  I don't know what that said, but I would sit here if I had a choice.
[2369.21s -> 2370.01s]  I'm bored.
[2370.01s -> 2371.77s]  I guess I should go attack a planet or something.
[2372.33s -> 2373.05s]  Hero is away.
[2373.05s -> 2373.77s]  Hero is in.
[2374.57s -> 2378.12s]  Well, it'd be considerate to, like, if the hero's there,
[2378.84s -> 2381.80s]  that I would lose, but I could get, like, my fill of attacking a planet,
[2381.80s -> 2383.16s]  but I would lose and I could just do it again.
[2383.16s -> 2383.64s]  I would leave.
[2383.64s -> 2384.84s]  I wouldn't actually destroy it, right?
[2385.72s -> 2389.05s]  Yeah, you got me.
[2389.05s -> 2400.07s]  Jesus.
[2400.63s -> 2407.69s]  It's been a while, but you came.
[2408.33s -> 2411.53s]  I really wanted to see you.
[2414.58s -> 2415.78s]  Just hold my hand.
[2416.34s -> 2420.79s]  Brings back memories, huh?
[2420.79s -> 2428.62s]  You sent me photo of that ghost.
[2428.62s -> 2433.05s]  I said it as my background, you know.
[2433.05s -> 2437.85s]  It was fun going to see that band.
[2437.93s -> 2443.16s]  We even went on a date with that cow, right?
[2443.88s -> 2446.20s]  Now I'd be like, okay, what are you talking about?
[2446.20s -> 2447.32s]  I know all about it.
[2450.25s -> 2452.81s]  It would have been nice to stay with you longer.
[2452.81s -> 2454.57s]  This is fucking horrible.
[2454.57s -> 2457.16s]  Remember the giant monster?
[2460.22s -> 2463.99s]  I totally beat it.
[2463.99s -> 2466.23s]  Do you remember the first day we met?
[2466.23s -> 2473.05s]  You were so indecisive.
[2473.05s -> 2474.73s]  Anyway, forget about me.
[2474.73s -> 2479.35s]  Just go find someone new.
[2479.35s -> 2481.77s]  What the fuck?
[2481.77s -> 2483.77s]  Sorry, can't stop crying.
[2483.77s -> 2485.72s]  Is this a bad ending?
[2485.72s -> 2488.47s]  I'm sorry I couldn't be more considerate.
[2488.79s -> 2492.54s]  But I'm not strong enough.
[2492.54s -> 2494.22s]  Wait, this is me.
[2494.22s -> 2496.14s]  I'm on my deathbed.
[2496.14s -> 2497.90s]  You always look out for other people.
[2497.90s -> 2501.66s]  You're so kind.
[2501.66s -> 2503.26s]  I really loved that about you.
[2503.26s -> 2506.17s]  I think it's me.
[2506.17s -> 2507.93s]  Even the times you didn't need to.
[2511.54s -> 2512.78s]  Oops.
[2512.78s -> 2513.18s]  Thank you.
[2516.46s -> 2517.10s]  Bye.
[2517.10s -> 2521.78s]  I don't want to die.
[2522.34s -> 2523.77s]  What the fuck?
[2523.77s -> 2524.57s]  This is got...
[2525.21s -> 2527.37s]  We went from like taking seats on the subway
[2527.37s -> 2529.45s]  to like somebody dying in your arms.
[2529.45s -> 2533.54s]  That's quite the bad ending.
[2533.54s -> 2551.46s]  That's still going, okay?
[2551.46s -> 2553.06s]  Very vaguely considerate.
[2556.90s -> 2558.02s]  Oh, should you get out of the way
[2558.02s -> 2559.86s]  for people walking up the escalator?
[2559.86s -> 2561.70s]  This person's fucking dead.
[2561.70s -> 2566.20s]  And it's your fault.
[2566.20s -> 2572.25s]  Oh.
[2572.25s -> 2573.29s]  Ooh, okay.
[2574.01s -> 2576.09s]  Your sympathy is your best quality.
[2576.09s -> 2577.61s]  Eco tote bag level.
[2581.77s -> 2583.21s]  All right, so my sympathy...
[2585.21s -> 2588.47s]  Ability to fit in, sense of duty,
[2588.47s -> 2592.23s]  quick thinking, application, and determination.
[2592.23s -> 2593.91s]  Eco tote bag level.
[2593.91s -> 2597.21s]  That's really fucking funny.
[2597.21s -> 2597.53s]  Okay.
[2600.78s -> 2602.30s]  Inconsiderate mode.
[2602.30s -> 2604.38s]  Considerate extras, chapters, secrets.
[2604.94s -> 2607.45s]  Okay, that was cool.
[2608.09s -> 2609.93s]  Should we just go right on to the next one?
[2609.93s -> 2611.21s]  There's three of these.
[2611.21s -> 2617.10s]  There's literally one, two, and three.
[2617.10s -> 2618.06s]  Should we just do number two?
[2618.62s -> 2621.08s]  Do inconsiderate mode.
[2621.08s -> 2621.80s]  All right.
[2621.80s -> 2623.26s]  What does this mean?
[2623.26s -> 2625.80s]  No one's going to hold you back.
[2625.80s -> 2627.24s]  Go ahead and mess around to your heart's content.
[2627.24s -> 2627.88s]  Okay.
[2627.88s -> 2630.73s]  Please be inconsiderate and mess around.
[2630.73s -> 2631.53s]  There's no explanations.
[2631.53s -> 2632.49s]  Just go nuts.
[2632.49s -> 2634.41s]  Or you can escape if you don't want to play anymore.
[2634.41s -> 2638.15s]  All right.
[2638.15s -> 2638.47s]  Oh, okay.
[2638.47s -> 2639.19s]  That's very...
[2639.19s -> 2639.91s]  I get it.
[2639.91s -> 2641.82s]  I get it.
[2641.82s -> 2643.61s]  You're just doing the opposite.
[2643.61s -> 2644.17s]  I get it.
[2644.17s -> 2645.21s]  Nah, I wouldn't need to do this.
[2645.21s -> 2645.61s]  Let's do that.
[2645.61s -> 2649.48s]  Let's do the next one.
[2649.48s -> 2649.96s]  Yeah.
[2649.96s -> 2650.52s]  Let's do...
[2650.52s -> 2653.58s]  Let's just go right on to the second one.
[2653.58s -> 2655.02s]  We could probably just bang them all out in a row.
[2655.02s -> 2660.34s]  Put the next one on.
[2660.34s -> 2660.58s]  Here.
[2660.58s -> 2665.74s]  You can get the cam for like 15 seconds while I do this.
[2671.05s -> 2672.17s]  Exit application.
[2672.17s -> 2675.35s]  You can see my pores.
[2675.35s -> 2676.15s]  Whatever.
[2676.15s -> 2676.95s]  We all have them.
[2676.95s -> 2681.08s]  All right.
[2681.08s -> 2682.60s]  Let's play inconsiderate two.
[2682.60s -> 2687.50s]  This one's called considerate more.
[2687.50s -> 2688.70s]  Considerate more.
[2688.70s -> 2691.85s]  A new era.
[2691.85s -> 2693.05s]  It's not too loud.
[2693.05s -> 2693.69s]  Brace yourself.
[2693.69s -> 2694.17s]  It might be...
[2694.73s -> 2695.61s]  Let's mute it.
[2695.61s -> 2697.64s]  I think we're good.
[2697.64s -> 2703.16s]  Does that count?
[2703.72s -> 2704.58s]  Okay.
[2704.58s -> 2707.00s]  Let's do it.
[2707.00s -> 2714.44s]  Hey, there it is.
[2714.44s -> 2714.60s]  Yeah.
[2714.60s -> 2715.72s]  I'll check the controls on this one.
[2716.20s -> 2718.04s]  Should I even change the game title?
[2718.04s -> 2722.25s]  I mean, do I even really need to change the game title?
[2722.25s -> 2723.13s]  It's the same fucking game.
[2724.97s -> 2725.29s]  All right.
[2726.49s -> 2727.37s]  Press any button.
[2732.39s -> 2732.71s]  All right.
[2732.71s -> 2733.19s]  Options.
[2736.50s -> 2736.82s]  Video.
[2736.82s -> 2738.42s]  Let's make sure it's in the right resolution.
[2738.98s -> 2739.22s]  Yeah.
[2739.22s -> 2740.18s]  1920 by 1080.
[2740.18s -> 2740.66s]  Full screen.
[2740.66s -> 2741.30s]  That's all I can do.
[2742.84s -> 2743.16s]  All right.
[2743.16s -> 2743.80s]  How to play.
[2744.44s -> 2747.83s]  This is a space where you are free to consider things as you like.
[2747.83s -> 2750.55s]  There's no one here to stop you from being as considered as you please.
[2753.48s -> 2756.44s]  After considering the situation, move the red object on the screen.
[2758.46s -> 2758.70s]  Okay.
[2759.26s -> 2762.50s]  But how do I move on the screen?
[2763.46s -> 2764.74s]  I think it's just the arrow keys in space.
[2766.38s -> 2767.18s]  It didn't tell you anything.
[2771.00s -> 2771.32s]  All right.
[2771.32s -> 2771.80s]  Consider it.
[2773.21s -> 2775.06s]  Use a controller.
[2775.06s -> 2776.26s]  It's just arrows in space.
[2776.26s -> 2776.58s]  Okay.
[2777.14s -> 2779.58s]  All right.
[2779.58s -> 2780.06s]  Part two.
[2782.26s -> 2783.14s]  Keep the face cam on.
[2783.14s -> 2785.30s]  I'll do the face cam for consider it's free.
[2785.30s -> 2787.78s]  That's what I'm going to have to keep really in with the third sequel.
[2787.78s -> 2788.18s]  You know what I mean?
[2794.66s -> 2798.58s]  Number one.
[2798.58s -> 2799.78s]  The announcement of a new era.
[2799.78s -> 2802.90s]  And the new name, the new era will be called Rewa.
[2805.59s -> 2806.07s]  Bro.
[2806.07s -> 2807.03s]  I held it up the wrong way.
[2807.99s -> 2816.90s]  There we go.
[2816.90s -> 2817.22s]  Okay.
[2817.86s -> 2819.82s]  Should I move?
[2820.38s -> 2824.54s]  Oh, this is for a ride.
[2824.54s -> 2825.18s]  What am I doing?
[2826.84s -> 2827.24s]  Okay.
[2827.88s -> 2830.12s]  You guys can go first because you're together, right?
[2830.12s -> 2835.51s]  Because then you'll take up two cars.
[2835.51s -> 2836.07s]  Line drive.
[2838.39s -> 2840.47s]  Oh, let the kid get it.
[2844.09s -> 2846.15s]  That's not how I would do this, by the way.
[2846.15s -> 2849.67s]  I would be up there trying to catch it with the sole reason that
[2849.67s -> 2852.50s]  two of us trying to catch it for that kid is...
[2853.14s -> 2853.38s]  All right.
[2853.38s -> 2853.86s]  Walk.
[2853.86s -> 2854.26s]  Holy shit.
[2854.26s -> 2854.74s]  Don't walk.
[2858.39s -> 2862.07s]  Two of us trying to catch it for that kid is exponentially more statistics for that to happen.
[2862.47s -> 2862.71s]  All right.
[2862.71s -> 2863.67s]  This is a comedy show.
[2863.67s -> 2865.66s]  I'll do it.
[2865.66s -> 2866.70s]  I won't do it.
[2866.70s -> 2870.04s]  Because everybody laughs, right?
[2870.04s -> 2873.99s]  The previous five questions.
[2873.99s -> 2877.22s]  Very vaguely considerate.
[2877.22s -> 2877.86s]  Oh.
[2877.86s -> 2885.80s]  You catch it and you hand the ball to the kid
[2885.80s -> 2888.12s]  to have the chance the kid actually gets the ball higher.
[2889.08s -> 2889.96s]  Let's eat ramen.
[2891.75s -> 2892.31s]  Recommended.
[2892.31s -> 2892.95s]  Your salt.
[2894.49s -> 2895.21s]  Salt ramen.
[2895.85s -> 2898.92s]  I'll take this one here.
[2899.56s -> 2902.26s]  How is that inconsistent?
[2902.26s -> 2903.62s]  It's what I wanted to order at a restaurant.
[2904.34s -> 2905.56s]  Thanks for the meal.
[2906.28s -> 2910.25s]  Who's waiting for a seat, please?
[2910.25s -> 2911.37s]  Oh, people are waiting.
[2912.01s -> 2913.05s]  No, don't fucking get up.
[2913.05s -> 2913.55s]  Get up.
[2921.53s -> 2925.72s]  Okay.
[2926.26s -> 2926.92s]  Here we go.
[2926.92s -> 2927.96s]  Oh, they're trying to take a picture.
[2928.60s -> 2942.39s]  See, I really tried to photobomb that, but I got it wrong.
[2943.03s -> 2946.94s]  Tablet.
[2946.94s -> 2947.18s]  Here.
[2948.04s -> 2948.84s]  You always give two.
[2951.37s -> 2952.97s]  Always.
[2952.97s -> 2955.53s]  Because some people, they want more than one.
[2955.53s -> 2957.32s]  But they'll never ask for more than one.
[2957.88s -> 2958.92s]  You were part-time for a...
[2958.92s -> 2959.24s]  What the...
[2959.24s -> 2960.04s]  I didn't even read it.
[2961.90s -> 2962.38s]  Books.
[2962.38s -> 2962.94s]  I don't know.
[2962.94s -> 2963.34s]  I didn't even...
[2963.34s -> 2970.18s]  I could have the chance to read the thing.
[2970.18s -> 2970.90s]  Considerably...
[2970.90s -> 2971.14s]  All right.
[2971.14s -> 2971.46s]  That's...
[2971.46s -> 2975.98s]  I was pretty considerate.
[2975.98s -> 2979.53s]  Three words per minute reading Andy.
[2979.53s -> 2980.41s]  No, it's called like...
[2981.05s -> 2982.57s]  50 words a minute reading Andy.
[2982.57s -> 2986.33s]  But it's split evenly across two different screens reading your comments.
[2986.33s -> 2987.82s]  I'll let you have one bite.
[2988.46s -> 2991.03s]  Oh, one bite.
[2991.03s -> 2991.43s]  Right there.
[2991.43s -> 2992.47s]  Okay, that's pretty good.
[2992.47s -> 2993.67s]  Never eat the top.
[2993.67s -> 2996.15s]  Always just one little bite at the bottom.
[2996.15s -> 2998.71s]  And you leave the frosting and shit forever for them to enjoy.
[2998.71s -> 3002.74s]  50 words per minute is still awful.
[3003.38s -> 3004.65s]  Starting school today.
[3004.65s -> 3005.85s]  Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump.
[3005.85s -> 3006.35s]  Okay.
[3008.38s -> 3009.90s]  Emperor.
[3009.90s -> 3011.64s]  Yep.
[3011.64s -> 3011.96s]  Here.
[3011.96s -> 3012.44s]  Oh, no.
[3012.44s -> 3013.08s]  I'm God.
[3018.49s -> 3019.45s]  That kid...
[3019.45s -> 3019.95s]  Wow.
[3020.33s -> 3023.95s]  Censored.
[3024.49s -> 3027.00s]  Quick, change the channel.
[3027.00s -> 3028.76s]  Get away from the lion sex.
[3028.76s -> 3032.70s]  There's only two channels on TV.
[3032.70s -> 3034.62s]  They're broadcasting this across every network.
[3035.18s -> 3037.82s]  I think that's very actually important to find out why.
[3038.38s -> 3040.46s]  Like, CBS, ABC, NBC.
[3040.46s -> 3041.34s]  They're all airing it.
[3041.34s -> 3041.84s]  Why?
[3045.82s -> 3046.32s]  Okay.
[3046.94s -> 3047.74s]  Yellow Fighter.
[3048.46s -> 3049.66s]  Oh, you got me.
[3052.54s -> 3053.04s]  Did I lose?
[3053.74s -> 3061.29s]  This isn't my stop.
[3061.29s -> 3075.54s]  Here we go.
[3075.54s -> 3076.90s]  That's the thing to do, but here's the thing.
[3076.90s -> 3079.42s]  That also seems kind of rude, doesn't it?
[3079.42s -> 3080.06s]  I don't know.
[3080.06s -> 3080.70s]  Part of me is like...
[3081.26s -> 3082.94s]  Everybody gets up and like...
[3082.94s -> 3083.44s]  What?
[3083.60s -> 3084.80s]  Something wrong with me?
[3084.80s -> 3089.47s]  You're just gonna get the fuck away from me as fast as possible?
[3089.47s -> 3090.03s]  Like, oh, wow.
[3090.03s -> 3092.51s]  You really hate sitting next to me so badly that
[3092.51s -> 3095.55s]  the second the seat came available, you ran the fuck away as soon as you could.
[3095.55s -> 3099.69s]  I know that's completely irrational, but I feel like somewhere in my brain I think that.
[3099.69s -> 3103.71s]  So moving one seat over...
[3103.71s -> 3104.11s]  Oh, shit.
[3104.11s -> 3104.67s]  That's right.
[3104.67s -> 3105.47s]  I did it wrong.
[3105.47s -> 3109.77s]  But one seat over is like...
[3111.21s -> 3114.17s]  You're barely offensive enough to me where one seat is fine.
[3114.17s -> 3116.75s]  Okay, so what are we doing?
[3116.75s -> 3117.39s]  Oh, we're gonna walk...
[3117.39s -> 3117.71s]  Oh, wait.
[3117.71s -> 3118.43s]  I have to go like this.
[3126.56s -> 3129.18s]  I wanna play this game.
[3130.94s -> 3131.58s]  That is cool.
[3133.48s -> 3135.24s]  One seat over is giving them space.
[3135.24s -> 3137.08s]  Five seats is you smell.
[3137.64s -> 3138.76s]  Yeah, that's fucked up.
[3138.76s -> 3139.72s]  I shouldn't have gone that far.
[3142.00s -> 3142.50s]  Um...
[3144.62s -> 3145.34s]  Can you fit?
[3148.12s -> 3149.08s]  They not want that?
[3149.80s -> 3151.68s]  Was I supposed to get out of the elevator?
[3151.68s -> 3159.52s]  Two.
[3161.07s -> 3161.57s]  Three.
[3163.42s -> 3163.92s]  Four.
[3164.70s -> 3172.86s]  My god.
[3173.66s -> 3174.54s]  Holy shit.
[3174.54s -> 3175.58s]  That would be terrifying.
[3185.02s -> 3185.52s]  Psycho.
[3187.45s -> 3188.89s]  It's a pleasure to meet you.
[3188.89s -> 3189.39s]  Here.
[3190.54s -> 3191.98s]  Take my card?
[3192.70s -> 3193.74s]  It's a pleasure to meet you.
[3193.74s -> 3195.10s]  How do I give you the card?
[3197.53s -> 3198.33s]  Other person, you.
[3198.33s -> 3199.45s]  This pleasure is all mine.
[3199.45s -> 3199.77s]  What's...
[3199.77s -> 3200.41s]  Why am I look...
[3200.41s -> 3201.21s]  Where am I looking?
[3201.21s -> 3202.01s]  It's pulling up.
[3202.81s -> 3203.61s]  It's pulling up.
[3204.59s -> 3205.23s]  Okay.
[3205.23s -> 3205.47s]  Where...
[3205.47s -> 3224.80s]  I'm gonna stay here.
[3224.80s -> 3226.00s]  Look at her face.
[3226.00s -> 3226.96s]  I couldn't look at her face.
[3226.96s -> 3229.24s]  I could just look at her teeth.
[3229.24s -> 3239.48s]  I'm moderately considerate.
[3239.48s -> 3241.48s]  Because it was definitely pulling up, guys.
[3241.48s -> 3242.60s]  Oh, my stomach.
[3256.19s -> 3257.24s]  Sorry.
[3257.24s -> 3257.88s]  Last one.
[3259.02s -> 3259.52s]  Uh...
[3260.22s -> 3261.34s]  Ow, my stomach.
[3261.34s -> 3262.96s]  I'm gonna shit my pants.
[3262.96s -> 3264.48s]  I'm no longer thinking about...
[3264.48s -> 3265.28s]  I just got killed.
[3265.28s -> 3265.78s]  Thanks.
[3266.68s -> 3268.04s]  I'm no longer thinking about...
[3268.60s -> 3269.24s]  Where the...
[3269.24s -> 3270.84s]  Like, how the stall's situated.
[3271.96s -> 3272.44s]  That shit.
[3273.00s -> 3274.20s]  If I'm gonna, like, shit my pants,
[3274.20s -> 3274.84s]  I'm going...
[3274.84s -> 3275.40s]  I gotta get in one.
[3275.40s -> 3276.04s]  I gotta get in one.
[3276.60s -> 3280.41s]  Oh, he's having his password in.
[3280.41s -> 3284.73s]  What am I supposed to not look at?
[3284.73s -> 3285.69s]  Just look at the doll?
[3290.40s -> 3291.36s]  Inconsiderate.
[3291.36s -> 3292.88s]  Both of those things could be weird.
[3295.04s -> 3296.24s]  Why are you staring at my computer?
[3296.24s -> 3297.28s]  Cafe moonbucks.
[3297.28s -> 3297.76s]  Outdoor...
[3297.76s -> 3298.16s]  No, no, no.
[3298.16s -> 3299.12s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3299.12s -> 3300.00s]  It's hot out.
[3300.00s -> 3300.50s]  Oh, I...
[3306.57s -> 3307.37s]  Oh, God.
[3308.01s -> 3309.45s]  Why does it have a gun?
[3309.45s -> 3324.62s]  Was it...
[3324.62s -> 3326.46s]  Maybe it was put my hands up?
[3326.46s -> 3327.55s]  Oh, here we go again.
[3328.11s -> 3345.32s]  I'm a ghost.
[3345.32s -> 3346.68s]  Why are you guys question marking me?
[3346.68s -> 3348.04s]  Why are you guys saying that's inconsiderate?
[3348.04s -> 3348.76s]  Is it really?
[3348.76s -> 3351.18s]  Because they just got a picture of a fucking ghost.
[3351.18s -> 3354.92s]  They can sell that for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[3354.92s -> 3355.88s]  I was trying to make them money.
[3355.88s -> 3375.37s]  It's considerate to get sucked up as, like, a boba ball?
[3377.79s -> 3378.29s]  Okay.
[3379.13s -> 3380.41s]  It was three minutes?
[3381.05s -> 3383.10s]  Big bro, I'm so hungry.
[3383.10s -> 3383.50s]  Hang on.
[3383.50s -> 3384.62s]  Big brother will earn some money.
[3385.34s -> 3387.28s]  Closer Trans Am quiz.
[3387.28s -> 3389.44s]  Person who answers correctly first will get the prize.
[3389.44s -> 3392.36s]  Mount Fuji is the tallest mountain in Japan.
[3396.03s -> 3396.43s]  I don't know.
[3399.56s -> 3399.96s]  Maybe?
[3401.02s -> 3401.98s]  Probably?
[3401.98s -> 3410.68s]  What does it say?
[3410.68s -> 3412.04s]  Oh, I gotta keep the spotlight.
[3412.60s -> 3419.29s]  And you, down to the front row.
[3420.48s -> 3422.16s]  Quit throwing popcorn.
[3422.16s -> 3438.65s]  That was good.
[3438.65s -> 3442.36s]  I know I voice cracked.
[3442.36s -> 3443.00s]  I know.
[3443.00s -> 3457.96s]  This is a natural sense.
[3458.76s -> 3461.34s]  It's not something that can be trained.
[3461.98s -> 3462.48s]  Okay.
[3462.94s -> 3464.88s]  Looks like I was right about this one.
[3465.52s -> 3467.60s]  Oh, put the glasses up.
[3467.60s -> 3471.88s]  Let's keep it up.
[3471.88s -> 3472.68s]  Keep the glasses up.
[3485.23s -> 3487.07s]  Just hold them on your face at this point.
[3487.63s -> 3495.87s]  Should I let them stay down?
[3495.87s -> 3504.75s]  Take this, our finishing move.
[3506.38s -> 3506.70s]  All right.
[3506.70s -> 3508.70s]  At this rate, it'll never end.
[3508.94s -> 3516.68s]  I'm dead?
[3516.68s -> 3526.97s]  All right, can I leave?
[3526.97s -> 3528.25s]  Is it from oil tycoon?
[3528.81s -> 3532.78s]  Oh, electric vehicle.
[3532.78s -> 3534.72s]  Let's get in the electric vehicle.
[3534.72s -> 3542.57s]  E.
[3542.57s -> 3546.62s]  It was from oil tycoon.
[3546.62s -> 3549.74s]  Well, look, look at it.
[3549.74s -> 3551.72s]  What do you mean it's an oil tycoon?
[3551.72s -> 3553.68s]  I don't know.
[3553.68s -> 3554.40s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[3554.40s -> 3560.96s]  About to use the hand dryer.
[3563.04s -> 3563.84s]  Put your hands.
[3563.84s -> 3565.28s]  No, put your hands underneath this.
[3565.92s -> 3566.64s]  I'm sorry.
[3566.64s -> 3567.68s]  I need to get this right.
[3568.32s -> 3572.12s]  Oh, whatever.
[3572.12s -> 3572.76s]  Fucking just go.
[3578.04s -> 3579.80s]  You never learned how gasoline is made?
[3579.80s -> 3580.60s]  I know.
[3580.60s -> 3582.04s]  But EV, I don't know.
[3582.44s -> 3583.56s]  I want to get in the EV car.
[3583.56s -> 3585.08s]  I don't care how considerate that is.
[3585.08s -> 3592.52s]  I don't even drive an EV car.
[3592.52s -> 3595.16s]  But I want to see what the inside looks like.
[3597.21s -> 3598.01s]  Oh, shit.
[3598.65s -> 3600.81s]  Oh, I just fucking killed that person.
[3601.53s -> 3606.41s]  Taking the train with your girlfriend.
[3607.87s -> 3608.11s]  Okay.
[3609.12s -> 3609.92s]  We're going to go over here.
[3610.48s -> 3612.94s]  Right here.
[3612.94s -> 3614.27s]  This looks good.
[3614.83s -> 3615.76s]  Want to sit down?
[3615.76s -> 3616.64s]  Yeah.
[3616.64s -> 3623.80s]  Your change is 3,201 yen.
[3626.70s -> 3626.94s]  Here.
[3627.66s -> 3631.05s]  What is the other person doing with their handout?
[3631.05s -> 3633.50s]  Is that the wrong customer?
[3638.59s -> 3639.39s]  Line up.
[3639.39s -> 3644.20s]  Attention.
[3648.57s -> 3655.04s]  Right.
[3655.04s -> 3655.52s]  What?
[3655.52s -> 3658.00s]  You just said right.
[3658.00s -> 3659.04s]  I'm the only one that listened.
[3659.68s -> 3660.80s]  No, stand up.
[3660.80s -> 3667.39s]  You okay?
[3667.39s -> 3669.15s]  Mr. A isn't feeling well.
[3669.15s -> 3676.48s]  The tallest mountain in Japan is Mount Fuji.
[3676.48s -> 3679.96s]  That's true.
[3679.96s -> 3681.16s]  I am a doll made of wood.
[3684.35s -> 3685.39s]  No, that's not a lie.
[3685.39s -> 3686.83s]  My whole body is made of metal.
[3686.83s -> 3687.47s]  That's a lie.
[3688.19s -> 3689.15s]  I wanted a group date.
[3689.15s -> 3690.19s]  I invented the light bulb.
[3690.19s -> 3690.99s]  This is all lies.
[3690.99s -> 3691.63s]  I'm Mario.
[3691.63s -> 3692.11s]  That's a lie.
[3692.75s -> 3694.96s]  I was the vote of the sexiest man again this year.
[3694.96s -> 3695.84s]  That's a lie.
[3695.84s -> 3696.48s]  I'm Mickey.
[3696.48s -> 3697.60s]  That's a lie.
[3697.60s -> 3698.16s]  Same company.
[3699.18s -> 3701.10s]  I was just scouted by a professional soccer team.
[3701.10s -> 3701.50s]  That's a lie.
[3703.82s -> 3704.78s]  They insured my legs.
[3704.78s -> 3705.26s]  That's a lie.
[3706.06s -> 3706.70s]  No, that's true.
[3718.08s -> 3719.36s]  I couldn't go any further.
[3719.36s -> 3721.58s]  I tried to go up higher and it gets stuck.
[3721.58s -> 3728.14s]  I could only go.
[3728.14s -> 3730.38s]  I could only move it one direction or the other.
[3730.38s -> 3732.54s]  I tried to move it longer like three or four times.
[3732.54s -> 3733.02s]  It didn't work.
[3741.26s -> 3743.02s]  Consider it to let you fight.
[3743.02s -> 3745.64s]  Yeah, I tried to make the nose longer.
[3745.64s -> 3746.04s]  It didn't work.
[3746.04s -> 3748.28s]  The controls in this game are fucking ass.
[3748.28s -> 3752.08s]  I have a date with my boyfriend today.
[3756.67s -> 3757.31s]  Prairie.
[3757.31s -> 3757.71s]  I don't know.
[3758.27s -> 3758.75s]  What's that mean?
[3759.55s -> 3778.86s]  Deers love prairies.
[3778.86s -> 3779.58s]  No smoking.
[3779.58s -> 3780.46s]  Put the cigarette down.
[3781.10s -> 3782.43s]  Put the cigarette down.
[3782.43s -> 3783.07s]  Get out of the way.
[3783.07s -> 3784.03s]  How do I put down the cigarette?
[3788.38s -> 3790.70s]  Smoking's not the inconsiderate part of this.
[3790.70s -> 3793.26s]  I mean, it is because there's a post-it sign there.
[3793.26s -> 3797.10s]  But walking in the way of the Olympian that's lighting the torch or whatever the fuck's going on
[3797.10s -> 3799.82s]  is that's like the ultimate inconsiderate thing.
[3800.38s -> 3806.19s]  Okay, here we go.
[3806.83s -> 3808.44s]  You ready?
[3810.62s -> 3811.02s]  All right.
[3813.13s -> 3813.61s]  Boring.
[3814.25s -> 3817.64s]  Take it.
[3818.20s -> 3838.60s]  That wasn't bad.
[3838.60s -> 3839.24s]  Okay.
[3839.24s -> 3840.51s]  Who do I?
[3840.51s -> 3841.47s]  What do I do?
[3841.47s -> 3842.67s]  That person's gonna die.
[3842.67s -> 3842.91s]  All right.
[3842.91s -> 3845.07s]  So then you get on here and you switch.
[3845.87s -> 3850.12s]  Here we go.
[3850.20s -> 3854.67s]  Move the cursor.
[3854.67s -> 3861.80s]  I'll move the cursor off the screen.
[3861.80s -> 3863.16s]  I'm not going to get that.
[3864.44s -> 3865.50s]  I could probably kick it.
[3865.50s -> 3865.74s]  No.
[3868.64s -> 3876.67s]  No, I try to put my foot up, but none of the buttons work.
[3876.67s -> 3878.84s]  I'm in charge of the paper ball.
[3878.84s -> 3880.44s]  The closer the timing, the better.
[3880.44s -> 3881.16s]  What?
[3881.16s -> 3883.13s]  I've been waiting.
[3883.69s -> 3886.49s]  I wanted to put my foot out and stop the can.
[3890.14s -> 3890.86s]  Okay.
[3890.86s -> 3893.13s]  All right then.
[3894.94s -> 3895.26s]  Again.
[3897.44s -> 3897.76s]  Oh!
[3903.82s -> 3906.22s]  I literally tried to put my foot out to stop the cannon.
[3906.22s -> 3907.98s]  None of the actions did anything.
[3907.98s -> 3919.18s]  That was fine.
[3919.18s -> 3923.95s]  I wish I had a bike.
[3924.67s -> 3925.63s]  Leave it to big bro.
[3927.36s -> 3928.40s]  Road race competition.
[3928.40s -> 3930.08s]  The winner of the race will get a brand new bicycle.
[3930.80s -> 3933.12s]  Okay.
[3933.12s -> 3937.00s]  Who will win the new bicycle?
[3937.00s -> 3938.48s]  This is the final stretch.
[3943.08s -> 3945.24s]  Um, I can't.
[3946.04s -> 3948.30s]  Wait, should I not be winning?
[3948.86s -> 3957.21s]  You're an asshole.
[3957.21s -> 3958.41s]  I'm trying to slow down.
[3958.41s -> 3959.69s]  If I couldn't, I couldn't stop.
[3961.08s -> 3967.42s]  He hates it.
[3967.42s -> 3969.90s]  I saw the can in the middle of the road and I was like, do I hit the can?
[3969.90s -> 3971.18s]  So I tried to run the can over.
[3971.18s -> 3972.78s]  The can didn't knock my bike over.
[3973.34s -> 3976.51s]  Am I the, who am I?
[3977.07s -> 3977.87s]  Am I the groom?
[3989.08s -> 3993.28s]  Ladies and gentlemen, please stand for the bride.
[4000.86s -> 4003.10s]  I should have just, I should have stayed seated.
[4003.10s -> 4007.47s]  Okay.
[4007.47s -> 4008.83s]  Um, what finger does it go on?
[4009.47s -> 4011.15s]  It goes on this one, right?
[4011.15s -> 4012.99s]  What, one, two, it goes on this finger.
[4013.55s -> 4024.35s]  It doesn't go on the middle finger.
[4025.07s -> 4026.19s]  Okay.
[4026.19s -> 4026.69s]  Hooray!
[4031.95s -> 4032.45s]  Yay!
[4033.31s -> 4043.07s]  Oh, time to catch it.
[4043.63s -> 4048.81s]  Oh, I missed it.
[4049.37s -> 4052.17s]  So you just pretend like you're going to go for it but you don't actually go for it.
[4052.17s -> 4055.05s]  Because I don't want to be lined up for like another hour taking photos
[4055.05s -> 4057.53s]  with like the photographer, videographer.
[4057.53s -> 4061.07s]  You pretend like you really want to catch it and then it's like,
[4061.07s -> 4062.03s]  oh no, I missed it.
[4062.03s -> 4063.23s]  Oh, congratulations.
[4063.23s -> 4067.10s]  I don't want to line up with like, oh, bring it over here in front of the cake.
[4067.10s -> 4068.38s]  Let's take five pictures.
[4068.38s -> 4069.98s]  No, just, I don't fucking want to do that.
[4069.98s -> 4076.22s]  Okay.
[4077.45s -> 4079.21s]  Uh, don't let go.
[4079.21s -> 4081.63s]  You better not let go.
[4082.19s -> 4090.54s]  Oh, I'm not letting go.
[4090.54s -> 4096.81s]  Look, I know like when the kid's riding the bike and it's like, did you let go?
[4096.81s -> 4097.61s]  Don't let go.
[4097.61s -> 4098.33s]  Did you let go?
[4099.05s -> 4100.49s]  I fucking didn't even pay attention.
[4101.29s -> 4103.28s]  Oops.
[4103.28s -> 4104.64s]  I denied my boss work.
[4105.74s -> 4106.24s]  Oops.
[4106.62s -> 4109.47s]  I give her, all right, just give everybody fucking holidays.
[4110.19s -> 4111.07s]  Give everybody a holiday.
[4111.71s -> 4114.20s]  Wait, I just, what did I just do?
[4114.20s -> 4116.60s]  I think I denied, I think I just made everybody work.
[4116.60s -> 4120.64s]  Lunch with a girl in a dress.
[4121.28s -> 4124.96s]  I didn't even, it was too fast.
[4124.96s -> 4125.76s]  I don't know where to go.
[4126.48s -> 4128.64s]  It was on the screen for less than a tenth of a second.
[4129.28s -> 4131.56s]  I don't know where it was supposed to go.
[4131.56s -> 4138.48s]  The store featured recent releases.
[4139.45s -> 4140.09s]  Texas Hold'em.
[4140.09s -> 4141.29s]  Oh, I want this one.
[4141.29s -> 4149.48s]  What about anything else?
[4149.48s -> 4167.00s]  I just woke up on my own.
[4167.00s -> 4174.78s]  Um, okay.
[4176.36s -> 4179.24s]  It was, she wasn't really by the game.
[4179.80s -> 4181.87s]  Why are you bad at this?
[4182.67s -> 4186.59s]  Explain to me how a guy flying across the screen with his lips puckered
[4187.15s -> 4189.20s]  and I'm lying down.
[4189.20s -> 4191.76s]  How am I supposed to understand what I have to do there?
[4191.76s -> 4192.80s]  What are you talking about?
[4199.29s -> 4200.09s]  Yeah, so what?
[4200.09s -> 4200.89s]  I have to get kissed?
[4200.89s -> 4202.09s]  I didn't even do anything.
[4202.09s -> 4203.61s]  I would have to sit up to get a kiss?
[4203.61s -> 4204.17s]  I don't understand.
[4204.73s -> 4210.73s]  Yeah, if you need to get out, go.
[4211.29s -> 4214.30s]  I'm not going to like close you in.
[4221.32s -> 4223.77s]  Okay, something wrong.
[4223.77s -> 4225.05s]  All right, what's wrong?
[4225.77s -> 4229.58s]  Oh, okay, I moved.
[4229.58s -> 4230.46s]  All right, move out of the way.
[4231.26s -> 4237.31s]  Am I controlling the smoke?
[4238.03s -> 4243.42s]  How is a grill sentient?
[4243.42s -> 4247.21s]  How can I be considerate with a grill smoke?
[4247.21s -> 4248.81s]  All right, cold sake.
[4248.81s -> 4250.28s]  Press the button to stop.
[4252.08s -> 4253.20s]  The button, okay.
[4253.20s -> 4257.05s]  I'm going to, that's what you want.
[4257.05s -> 4262.43s]  No use, I'm so sleepy.
[4262.43s -> 4263.23s]  I've got to take a nap.
[4273.71s -> 4274.83s]  No, that's not considerate.
[4279.66s -> 4281.50s]  Your yearly physical exam came in.
[4281.50s -> 4283.66s]  We'll start with a urine test.
[4283.66s -> 4284.78s]  Please fill this cup up.
[4297.66s -> 4298.94s]  That's right to the brim.
[4301.88s -> 4304.44s]  It's just like a party cup too, by the way.
[4311.16s -> 4313.56s]  Not even in a tight, encloseable thing.
[4314.20s -> 4315.80s]  Why was it just a big solo cup?
[4316.36s -> 4319.29s]  I'll get our tickets to the soccer game.
[4319.29s -> 4320.89s]  Only three tickets left.
[4320.89s -> 4327.95s]  No, grandma wants to go to the soccer game.
[4327.95s -> 4328.83s]  There's three tickets left.
[4328.83s -> 4331.31s]  I'm going to go get a, I'm not going to just, no.
[4331.31s -> 4334.96s]  I'm sorry, okay?
[4339.34s -> 4341.34s]  The person that looks at this guy gets shot.
[4341.34s -> 4352.72s]  So I'm not doing that.
[4352.72s -> 4358.19s]  Well, just a fucking chug in his blood.
[4361.77s -> 4372.41s]  What's considerate in a pistol duel is, okay, he cheated.
[4373.74s -> 4374.94s]  He did that literally.
[4374.94s -> 4377.68s]  Like that was too quick.
[4377.68s -> 4378.32s]  I pressed left.
[4378.88s -> 4383.63s]  That's better.
[4386.49s -> 4387.37s]  Is it not better?
[4387.93s -> 4390.17s]  Was it too much?
[4393.39s -> 4394.51s]  No, you idiot.
[4394.51s -> 4395.47s]  What are you doing?
[4395.47s -> 4396.51s]  Why would you take it away?
[4396.51s -> 4397.71s]  I didn't want to take it away.
[4409.40s -> 4410.68s]  Wrong person.
[4410.68s -> 4412.52s]  Taking in the night scenery with your girlfriend.
[4415.20s -> 4417.20s]  This person's having sex in their car.
[4418.00s -> 4423.60s]  Okay, was that a taxi?
[4424.56s -> 4425.92s]  That looked like a taxi.
[4425.92s -> 4429.21s]  The family's calling.
[4429.21s -> 4430.25s]  Mom, dad, or girl.
[4431.53s -> 4432.65s]  It's always you go right to mom.
[4433.45s -> 4435.87s]  Every dog that's ever been in my family.
[4435.87s -> 4438.51s]  Every dog, it always goes to mom.
[4438.51s -> 4439.15s]  Always.
[4439.15s -> 4443.08s]  Make little one inch bigger.
[4443.08s -> 4447.74s]  How much bigger?
[4447.74s -> 4452.03s]  Is that good?
[4452.03s -> 4452.83s]  More?
[4452.83s -> 4456.22s]  I don't know how big you want me to make little one inch.
[4456.22s -> 4461.29s]  If I could make them too big.
[4461.85s -> 4467.74s]  Wait, why am I sneaking out?
[4467.74s -> 4468.62s]  I didn't read the text.
[4468.62s -> 4469.74s]  I was too busy looking at it over here.
[4469.74s -> 4470.46s]  Everybody yelling at me.
[4487.66s -> 4489.18s]  Yeah, I like this dance.
[4497.69s -> 4498.89s]  Ooh, nice, okay.
[4499.53s -> 4501.20s]  I saw the belly move.
[4516.36s -> 4516.68s]  Cool.
[4521.72s -> 4523.48s]  All right, I did that one perfectly.
[4523.56s -> 4533.23s]  Plainly considerate.
[4533.23s -> 4542.81s]  I don't know what the scale here is.
[4542.81s -> 4543.93s]  That was a good match.
[4543.93s -> 4552.24s]  Let's head home.
[4552.24s -> 4553.28s]  I hope I clean up.
[4553.92s -> 4556.88s]  I wouldn't be, I wouldn't do this at all, by the way.
[4556.88s -> 4558.40s]  I'm not touching somebody else's trash.
[4559.39s -> 4562.35s]  I'm going to make sure that my area is perfect.
[4562.35s -> 4565.88s]  So that was, wait, what is going on?
[4565.88s -> 4571.04s]  You see when and might as then as well, right?
[4571.04s -> 4571.28s]  Yep.
[4572.64s -> 4572.88s]  Yep.
[4574.64s -> 4575.36s]  But said that.
[4576.96s -> 4577.84s]  Don't fall asleep.
[4579.52s -> 4580.24s]  Can you believe it?
[4580.24s -> 4580.88s]  Ha ha ha ha.
[4580.88s -> 4581.84s]  I know, I can't believe it.
[4581.84s -> 4587.23s]  It's crazy.
[4587.23s -> 4588.51s]  Let's cross at the crosswalk.
[4592.27s -> 4592.99s]  It's not ready yet.
[4593.47s -> 4595.58s]  Do I go?
[4595.58s -> 4596.14s]  Where's the light?
[4598.88s -> 4600.72s]  That person was sitting in the middle of the intersection.
[4600.72s -> 4606.72s]  I like had to go.
[4606.72s -> 4608.56s]  Making cold Chinese noodles.
[4608.56s -> 4610.57s]  I think I did it.
[4610.57s -> 4612.89s]  Did I?
[4612.89s -> 4622.40s]  Bro, look, it's a sea turtle.
[4622.40s -> 4623.12s]  Wow, for real.
[4623.68s -> 4626.35s]  She's here to lay her eggs.
[4626.35s -> 4627.23s]  Let's watch over them.
[4627.23s -> 4627.71s]  Absolutely.
[4634.41s -> 4637.72s]  He wants to become a hero.
[4639.96s -> 4640.68s]  What?
[4640.68s -> 4644.41s]  I don't get it.
[4644.41s -> 4646.20s]  What was I supposed to do?
[4659.87s -> 4661.47s]  You were part-time for a moving company.
[4662.81s -> 4664.41s]  I didn't even get to read this.
[4664.41s -> 4666.17s]  I can't read that fast.
[4666.17s -> 4668.33s]  I'm going to put dad's DVDs at somewhere.
[4668.89s -> 4683.69s]  And that's how you solve these formulas.
[4683.69s -> 4685.13s]  This will be on the test.
[4685.13s -> 4686.09s]  Make sure to take notes.
[4693.32s -> 4696.14s]  Okay, I had to put sunglasses on?
[4701.56s -> 4702.60s]  Move out of the way.
[4702.60s -> 4703.24s]  Move out of the way.
[4703.24s -> 4703.96s]  Get out of the way.
[4703.96s -> 4704.36s]  Dodge.
[4705.37s -> 4706.09s]  Dodge.
[4706.09s -> 4719.77s]  What the hell's going on?
[4719.77s -> 4722.35s]  January, New Year's Day.
[4722.35s -> 4723.87s]  Exorcism rituals.
[4723.87s -> 4726.70s]  Oh, I just got exorcised.
[4726.70s -> 4734.41s]  The evil Mr. Rogue was cast down into hell.
[4734.97s -> 4738.80s]  However, since he once saved a spider in the past,
[4738.80s -> 4743.68s]  the Buddha lowered a thread of spider silk down to him.
[4744.00s -> 4746.16s]  Seeing it, he went and started climbing the thread.
[4746.16s -> 4750.57s]  But also, others crowded around, seeking to climb up as well.
[4751.29s -> 4755.80s]  Everybody stay calm.
[4755.80s -> 4758.33s]  The thread will snap if we all try to climb.
[4758.89s -> 4760.57s]  He's so smart, so persuasive.
[4762.83s -> 4764.59s]  Make a line and we'll climb one at a time.
[4765.23s -> 4770.46s]  When you reach the top, call down for the next person.
[4773.79s -> 4774.43s]  So smart.
[4776.44s -> 4777.16s]  Wait, this is...
[4780.24s -> 4787.58s]  Okay, I'm going to snip the line and fucking...
[4790.12s -> 4790.76s]  I'm not going to...
[4790.76s -> 4792.84s]  No, I'm not going to cut the thread.
[4797.77s -> 4800.57s]  I gave that opportunity, so I'm just going to take it away.
[4801.21s -> 4803.58s]  Shake.
[4803.58s -> 4811.52s]  Those people were in hell.
[4811.52s -> 4816.00s]  So don't make the offer if you don't plan on going through with it.
[4816.00s -> 4822.03s]  Did I move?
[4822.03s -> 4822.59s]  What am I doing?
[4823.87s -> 4824.37s]  Shit.
[4825.15s -> 4826.19s]  I'm sorry.
[4826.19s -> 4827.55s]  I didn't know what I was supposed to be doing.
[4829.07s -> 4829.71s]  I don't get it.
[4829.71s -> 4830.59s]  Just stand still?
[4831.15s -> 4835.60s]  Did I miss?
[4851.48s -> 4856.40s]  I'm going to tell you, ask me for my daughter's hand.
[4858.80s -> 4860.24s]  Three, two, one.
[4860.88s -> 4864.91s]  No way.
[4864.91s -> 4867.07s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[4867.07s -> 4868.35s]  This doesn't make any sense.
[4868.35s -> 4869.63s]  I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[4870.52s -> 4875.84s]  I pressed every button once in a lifetime opportunity.
[4876.48s -> 4882.19s]  All right, open your eyes now.
[4885.82s -> 4886.22s]  All right.
[4887.50s -> 4888.70s]  You can see it.
[4889.34s -> 4890.78s]  Look at it with your eyes.
[4890.78s -> 4892.06s]  You put sunglasses on.
[4892.06s -> 4894.46s]  Whatever you're supposed to do, the special ones.
[4894.46s -> 4907.52s]  You need to look at it with the special sunglasses.
[4914.70s -> 4916.14s]  Why did the door not close?
[4916.14s -> 4919.98s]  You had to hold it there?
[4919.98s -> 4920.54s]  I couldn't.
[4920.54s -> 4921.34s]  I was trying to.
[4925.08s -> 4928.70s]  Here, eat some.
[4928.70s -> 4931.18s]  I swear to God, half the time the input doesn't do anything.
[4931.18s -> 4935.45s]  Match the rhythm and kick the whatever it is.
[4935.45s -> 4941.26s]  Okay.
[4956.76s -> 4957.56s]  On the count of three.
[4962.75s -> 4963.47s]  Nice.
[4963.47s -> 4975.16s]  Here we go.
[4975.16s -> 4979.23s]  New year in five, four, three, two, one.
[4982.49s -> 4983.53s]  What the fuck?
[4983.53s -> 4986.14s]  I pressed happy new year.
[4988.17s -> 4989.05s]  Happy new year.
[4989.69s -> 4992.76s]  Now for the next song.
[4993.40s -> 4999.02s]  Get a controller.
[4999.02s -> 5001.82s]  I might just plug a controller in, but I feel like it's not going to do anything.
[5001.82s -> 5009.58s]  I don't even see controller support on this Steam page.
[5009.58s -> 5012.48s]  Okay, so it's time to walk.
[5013.12s -> 5014.43s]  All right, walk.
[5016.19s -> 5020.03s]  Fuck.
[5020.03s -> 5023.31s]  Hey, why press button to clap hands?
[5030.46s -> 5032.76s]  Hmm?
[5032.76s -> 5033.64s]  You said clap the...
[5033.64s -> 5035.24s]  You said clap hands.
[5035.24s -> 5036.28s]  You said clap hands.
[5037.47s -> 5038.99s]  You told me to clap my hands.
[5038.99s -> 5047.47s]  Do I hatch while the mom's here?
[5047.47s -> 5049.42s]  Or hatch...
[5049.42s -> 5050.78s]  No, no, I don't want to hatch with you here.
[5050.78s -> 5051.58s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[5065.29s -> 5067.21s]  Staff, congratulations on graduating.
[5067.85s -> 5071.37s]  So be our final homeroom together until the next game, which is coming up right now.
[5071.93s -> 5073.77s]  Just a quick roll call, then we're finished.
[5073.77s -> 5075.61s]  Be sure to answer when I call your name.
[5076.25s -> 5084.80s]  The really weird thing to see looking out your window is scrolling credits.
[5086.36s -> 5088.20s]  At that point, you're in a simulation, right?
[5088.76s -> 5090.88s]  Would that be enough for you to know?
[5098.75s -> 5099.39s]  Too fast?
[5100.03s -> 5102.01s]  What?
[5102.01s -> 5104.04s]  Oh, there.
[5104.68s -> 5108.73s]  And finally, you.
[5109.37s -> 5115.56s]  After today, you will each begin walking your own path.
[5115.56s -> 5121.55s]  From time to time, you will find yourselves in situations where you will need to be considerate of others.
[5122.11s -> 5125.72s]  However, being considerate all the time isn't always a good thing.
[5126.83s -> 5128.51s]  You need to also think of yourself.
[5129.71s -> 5134.35s]  Being considerate of others and knowing when to take care of yourself are both vital skills.
[5135.87s -> 5138.11s]  I want you to become strong adults.
[5138.11s -> 5139.71s]  There is something out this window.
[5144.89s -> 5150.04s]  Okay, everybody stand and bow.
[5150.04s -> 5150.52s]  Goodbye.
[5156.73s -> 5157.61s]  So what did I get for...
[5157.61s -> 5159.05s]  What's my personality like?
[5159.05s -> 5170.57s]  What happened?
[5170.57s -> 5172.01s]  I've realized how to walk.
[5172.01s -> 5179.34s]  I just know it.
[5179.34s -> 5179.90s]  He stood up.
[5179.90s -> 5181.10s]  Yep, get right in the camera.
[5181.90s -> 5183.10s]  Camera, get the camera.
[5183.10s -> 5184.81s]  What are you doing?
[5185.37s -> 5189.50s]  Come on, what are you doing?
[5198.09s -> 5198.81s]  He messed that up.
[5198.81s -> 5209.63s]  I didn't.
[5209.63s -> 5214.03s]  Okay, total.
[5214.03s -> 5216.59s]  Generally considerate and understanding mediator.
[5216.59s -> 5219.98s]  Detailed results.
[5219.98s -> 5225.72s]  Common sense versus specified knowledge.
[5225.72s -> 5227.00s]  Above average, common sense.
[5227.00s -> 5230.84s]  Commonly understood social manners and etiquette is the first step in becoming more considerate.
[5230.84s -> 5233.16s]  I'm above average.
[5233.16s -> 5234.68s]  All right, specified knowledge.
[5234.68s -> 5237.00s]  Specialized know-how that isn't commonly known.
[5237.00s -> 5239.72s]  Having a lot of knowledge is an essential weapon for being more considerate.
[5239.72s -> 5242.76s]  Average, that's fine.
[5242.76s -> 5245.39s]  Spatial awareness and group dynamics.
[5245.39s -> 5247.15s]  Average and above average for group dynamics.
[5247.15s -> 5249.71s]  The knowledge to understand the role others expect you to play in a group.
[5249.71s -> 5253.13s]  Your cooperative nature leads to smooth teamwork.
[5253.13s -> 5254.08s]  All right.
[5254.08s -> 5255.44s]  Look at this adulting shit though.
[5255.44s -> 5258.19s]  Look at that.
[5258.19s -> 5262.67s]  Ability to step back and take in the situation then assume the roles others don't want to do.
[5262.67s -> 5266.32s]  Allowing everyone to better enjoy themselves.
[5266.32s -> 5267.52s]  And my sympathy is pretty average.
[5267.52s -> 5270.16s]  Whether or not you can put yourself in another one's shoes and understand how they feel.
[5273.23s -> 5275.55s]  Information integration is above average.
[5275.55s -> 5281.26s]  The power to instantly find the right meaning from fragmented hints with no context.
[5281.26s -> 5282.46s]  My speed is average.
[5282.46s -> 5285.02s]  The ability to immediately make decisions in any situation.
[5285.02s -> 5290.89s]  The speed to understand and react to a situation.
[5290.89s -> 5292.09s]  My rhythm is above average.
[5292.09s -> 5293.69s]  Talent of following rhythm is instructed.
[5293.69s -> 5299.85s]  Being flexible with the ability to go with the flow will be useful in being considerate.
[5299.85s -> 5300.81s]  And then interval.
[5300.81s -> 5301.61s]  Good and bad intervals.
[5301.61s -> 5304.73s]  Whether or not you understand the best timing when enacting in a series of events.
[5306.62s -> 5308.22s]  I'm really good at adulting.
[5308.22s -> 5311.29s]  All right, cool.
[5311.29s -> 5313.18s]  We got one more of these to do.
[5313.18s -> 5318.08s]  We got one more to do.
[5320.08s -> 5320.80s]  Average Andy.
[5321.68s -> 5324.48s]  I got good and above average in like four things we're talking about.
[5324.48s -> 5326.78s]  All right, I want to play the last one.
[5327.42s -> 5338.72s]  This is not all we're doing today.
[5340.80s -> 5343.84s]  Those of you freaking out saying that this is the end of the stream in like 30 minutes.
[5343.84s -> 5345.20s]  No, you're completely inaccurate.
[5346.32s -> 5350.32s]  We're going to be playing Roswell Agent after this.
[5350.32s -> 5352.22s]  For the remainder of today's stream.
[5354.91s -> 5357.13s]  And where is it?
[5357.69s -> 5362.35s]  All right, considerate three.
[5362.35s -> 5363.63s]  More and more.
[5363.63s -> 5369.24s]  Father to son in this.
[5371.42s -> 5372.30s]  Hey, Billy Bob.
[5372.30s -> 5374.78s]  Thanks for the vibe.
[5374.78s -> 5375.93s]  Immunity subs.
[5377.13s -> 5378.09s]  Agent of Roswell.
[5378.09s -> 5379.45s]  Yeah, Roswell Agent.
[5379.45s -> 5380.01s]  Agent Roswell.
[5380.01s -> 5380.73s]  I don't know, whatever it is.
[5381.37s -> 5396.96s]  Why is my screen capture not picking it up?
[5396.96s -> 5398.94s]  Hello?
[5400.41s -> 5404.62s]  There it is.
[5404.62s -> 5407.82s]  All right, I promised a face cam for this one, so I'll keep it on.
[5409.47s -> 5410.27s]  Are you purple?
[5413.84s -> 5415.04s]  It's a white balance in this room.
[5417.84s -> 5418.96s]  You're so purple.
[5421.24s -> 5424.12s]  I didn't think I was purple until you just said that.
[5424.12s -> 5425.96s]  I don't, because the white balance is wrong.
[5440.59s -> 5446.81s]  There, this is like what it's actually like in this room right now.
[5446.81s -> 5452.91s]  I'm still purple?
[5454.35s -> 5455.79s]  Whatever, I'm fucking purple.
[5455.79s -> 5456.27s]  Who cares?
[5461.85s -> 5462.81s]  All right, this is it.
[5462.81s -> 5463.61s]  Press any button.
[5463.61s -> 5464.89s]  I think they all just control the same way.
[5465.53s -> 5470.17s]  All right, let's go.
[5471.63s -> 5473.31s]  Consider it with a face cam, I promised.
[5473.31s -> 5476.60s]  Free to consider things, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5477.24s -> 5480.20s]  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[5480.84s -> 5481.56s]  All right, number one.
[5486.14s -> 5488.38s]  So I would grab onto right here.
[5489.18s -> 5492.67s]  Because I'm not going to just stand there.
[5492.67s -> 5493.23s]  That's dangerous.
[5493.23s -> 5493.87s]  You could get hurt.
[5494.51s -> 5498.60s]  That's it.
[5499.16s -> 5502.76s]  You look like a plum.
[5507.79s -> 5508.67s]  Welcome, you.
[5508.67s -> 5509.47s]  Glad you're here.
[5510.19s -> 5513.69s]  The world is an estate at the hands of the Demon King.
[5514.49s -> 5517.15s]  Okay.
[5517.95s -> 5519.07s]  Would you help save it?
[5522.86s -> 5523.10s]  Yeah.
[5523.98s -> 5524.30s]  Money?
[5530.81s -> 5531.45s]  Yes, I'll help.
[5534.41s -> 5535.13s]  This one's correct.
[5535.77s -> 5539.34s]  Store your mayonnaise upside down.
[5539.34s -> 5541.72s]  Store some of your, most of your condiments upside down.
[5542.28s -> 5556.67s]  Store your bread upside down.
[5557.71s -> 5558.75s]  The consider it mart.
[5559.39s -> 5563.08s]  I'm just going to go to the one that has less people.
[5572.22s -> 5573.34s]  Did I bumper?
[5573.34s -> 5575.96s]  Don't change the lines.
[5575.96s -> 5577.32s]  What do you mean don't change the lines?
[5582.27s -> 5585.31s]  That helps like the store stay efficient.
[5585.31s -> 5587.15s]  And yeah, you change lines.
[5587.95s -> 5588.91s]  Oh no, I'm late.
[5589.71s -> 5597.45s]  That's going to barrel through people.
[5604.68s -> 5605.56s]  Okay, big bro.
[5605.56s -> 5606.44s]  I'm so hungry.
[5606.44s -> 5607.56s]  Big bro has something to do.
[5608.75s -> 5610.03s]  Old made championship.
[5610.03s -> 5612.12s]  All right, don't get this wrong.
[5612.12s -> 5613.24s]  Final round.
[5613.24s -> 5615.16s]  Who will win the all you can eat sushi prize?
[5621.63s -> 5622.27s]  Did I what?
[5622.27s -> 5622.83s]  I don't know.
[5622.83s -> 5624.11s]  What was I supposed to do?
[5624.11s -> 5628.38s]  I'm going to take the picture.
[5628.38s -> 5629.02s]  All right, I gotta get in.
[5632.08s -> 5632.88s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[5632.88s -> 5633.20s]  Right here.
[5637.26s -> 5639.42s]  Am I like shouting out something?
[5639.42s -> 5640.38s]  I'm doing an ad.
[5641.02s -> 5648.72s]  All right, movie feedback.
[5648.72s -> 5654.78s]  And then be pissed that they're taking so long.
[5655.42s -> 5662.84s]  I would not stand up.
[5662.84s -> 5663.48s]  Marathon.
[5664.20s -> 5667.76s]  We'll reach the goal together.
[5668.32s -> 5669.13s]  We sure will.
[5670.01s -> 5675.28s]  All right, I'm going to make this look good.
[5675.28s -> 5676.16s]  But I still want to win.
[5676.72s -> 5677.50s]  You know what I mean?
[5678.38s -> 5681.77s]  We're almost there.
[5682.49s -> 5684.59s]  Like I won.
[5687.10s -> 5687.98s]  It was close.
[5687.98s -> 5689.50s]  It was so close.
[5689.50s -> 5691.18s]  But I fucking win.
[5691.18s -> 5698.41s]  Yeah, remember we were like neck and neck.
[5698.41s -> 5699.93s]  Yeah, it could have been anybody's game.
[5699.93s -> 5700.57s]  But it was still me.
[5702.27s -> 5703.15s]  I can't believe I won.
[5703.15s -> 5703.71s]  What the fuck?
[5703.71s -> 5704.11s]  I know.
[5704.67s -> 5707.96s]  That's not what do you mean it's bad friend?
[5707.96s -> 5711.34s]  That's a planetary ego.
[5711.34s -> 5714.88s]  A planetary ego would just be to sprint.
[5714.88s -> 5717.20s]  Take both cups of water that they were handing both of us.
[5717.20s -> 5718.24s]  Drink them both.
[5718.24s -> 5721.77s]  Throw the cups on the ground and sprint to the finish.
[5721.77s -> 5723.05s]  I stayed with my friend.
[5723.05s -> 5725.29s]  I knew I was capable of winning the race.
[5725.29s -> 5727.29s]  But I stayed with my friend.
[5727.29s -> 5728.09s]  We talked about shit.
[5728.09s -> 5730.09s]  We were hanging out jogging and we did it on our own time.
[5730.09s -> 5731.45s]  But I got in first place.
[5731.45s -> 5740.96s]  I didn't.
[5740.96s -> 5743.12s]  Somebody said going easy is not considerate.
[5745.66s -> 5746.86s]  All right, I hope it reaches him.
[5747.50s -> 5757.77s]  What?
[5757.77s -> 5759.05s]  I was supposed to hit him in the head?
[5759.05s -> 5759.45s]  What?
[5759.45s -> 5760.49s]  Why not?
[5760.49s -> 5760.73s]  What?
[5762.17s -> 5763.93s]  That was very unclear.
[5763.93s -> 5768.19s]  Is it going to roll over me?
[5776.01s -> 5778.68s]  I found a funny video.
[5778.68s -> 5779.80s]  Yeah, let's do it.
[5779.80s -> 5780.97s]  It's going to be the two...
[5780.97s -> 5781.45s]  I knew it.
[5781.45s -> 5783.29s]  It was going to be the two lions having sex.
[5784.75s -> 5786.11s]  And this is an ad.
[5786.11s -> 5788.11s]  Why is this an ad on YouTube?
[5788.11s -> 5793.48s]  I'm not...
[5793.48s -> 5793.96s]  I want...
[5793.96s -> 5794.36s]  Why?
[5794.36s -> 5795.24s]  I would be...
[5795.24s -> 5796.52s]  Fuck the considerate shit.
[5796.52s -> 5799.24s]  I would be so confused as to why that existed.
[5799.96s -> 5805.31s]  Next stop is your stop.
[5805.87s -> 5807.79s]  Announce it.
[5807.79s -> 5813.08s]  You can be considerate...
[5813.08s -> 5829.69s]  The fuck doesn't do that?
[5839.80s -> 5840.76s]  Who doesn't do that?
[5840.76s -> 5843.64s]  If you get one of those clickable mechanical pencils,
[5844.44s -> 5846.11s]  one of the first thing you're going to do that
[5846.11s -> 5847.87s]  until it all comes all the way out.
[5847.87s -> 5850.27s]  And then you're going to try to write with it
[5851.66s -> 5852.86s]  and to be really gentle and be like,
[5852.86s -> 5854.30s]  holy shit, can I do this?
[5854.30s -> 5855.90s]  And it's going to break in half
[5855.90s -> 5856.94s]  and you're going to go, fuck, whatever.
[5856.94s -> 5858.30s]  And then you're going to pick up the pieces.
[5858.30s -> 5860.70s]  You're going to unscrew the top of the thing,
[5860.70s -> 5862.78s]  put the pieces back in because it doesn't matter.
[5862.78s -> 5864.06s]  It's not like you have to throw it away.
[5865.69s -> 5867.37s]  Going like this and going like this,
[5867.37s -> 5870.33s]  you put the lead back, the graphite back in the top.
[5870.97s -> 5877.16s]  What are you guys talking about?
[5877.16s -> 5878.36s]  You just put it back in.
[5881.23s -> 5882.27s]  You can refill them?
[5882.27s -> 5882.51s]  Yeah.
[5883.82s -> 5884.78s]  Yes, you can.
[5884.78s -> 5886.62s]  What do you mean you can't refill them?
[5886.62s -> 5894.41s]  That's, I, where, what planet are you guys on?
[5894.97s -> 5897.36s]  You did, did, did, did, did, did the slider,
[5897.36s -> 5898.32s]  did, did, did, did, did the slider.
[5898.32s -> 5900.32s]  And you put the, the eraser comes off
[5900.32s -> 5901.60s]  and you put it inside where the eraser is.
[5901.60s -> 5902.48s]  Did you not know that?
[5903.04s -> 5903.84s]  Hold on, what do I have to do?
[5908.81s -> 5910.86s]  I, did I get it?
[5911.50s -> 5915.50s]  I got it.
[5915.50s -> 5920.06s]  That is confirmed stupid.
[5925.98s -> 5927.34s]  Oh, watch out for the, yeah, old lady.
[5927.90s -> 5929.18s]  You go ahead and sit down.
[5929.18s -> 5931.34s]  But like, holy shit, fucking hurry up.
[5931.34s -> 5932.38s]  The train is moving.
[5932.38s -> 5935.00s]  Okay, we're good.
[5935.00s -> 5939.18s]  I think that would be dangerous.
[5939.82s -> 5944.57s]  If you did that to a mechanical pencil,
[5944.57s -> 5945.69s]  we would no longer be friends.
[5947.45s -> 5947.93s]  Bye bye.
[5948.49s -> 5952.96s]  Reporting from the field.
[5952.96s -> 5953.68s]  That's it from me.
[5953.68s -> 5954.72s]  Wait, should I not be over here?
[5963.95s -> 5966.88s]  It's hot.
[5966.88s -> 5968.91s]  Open the window a little.
[5968.91s -> 5970.91s]  This is a waste collection truck.
[5970.91s -> 5971.47s]  Wait, what?
[5975.55s -> 5976.35s]  TVs.
[5976.35s -> 5986.36s]  No, I, but will the smelly, smelly air come up here?
[5986.36s -> 5986.92s]  What?
[5986.92s -> 5990.46s]  I'm trying to have the, this is a waste collection truck.
[5990.46s -> 5991.66s]  Okay, I know you're trying to pay attention,
[5991.66s -> 5997.34s]  but like, it's, that's, that's good.
[5998.14s -> 6002.03s]  The author feels, I don't know if it's okay that,
[6002.03s -> 6002.99s]  I opened the window and it said,
[6002.99s -> 6004.43s]  we're a garbage collection truck.
[6004.43s -> 6004.67s]  I don't know.
[6004.67s -> 6006.35s]  I figured they was going to go in there and smell.
[6016.51s -> 6017.95s]  Can you, are you going to do something about that?
[6023.88s -> 6025.00s]  I think I'm pretty considerate.
[6036.56s -> 6037.04s]  Come back.
[6037.68s -> 6038.00s]  What?
[6047.58s -> 6050.08s]  Is he muted?
[6051.12s -> 6055.20s]  Stand up.
[6055.20s -> 6056.16s]  Sit, no, don't sit.
[6056.16s -> 6056.72s]  Should I sit?
[6057.44s -> 6059.82s]  I feel like this is way more inconsiderate
[6059.82s -> 6062.06s]  than just standing and not leaning back like an asshole.
[6073.93s -> 6074.89s]  Come back up.
[6074.89s -> 6075.45s]  Come back up.
[6077.23s -> 6079.87s]  Uh, dude, I can't pull it back up.
[6080.59s -> 6084.56s]  I don't understand.
[6084.56s -> 6085.44s]  None of them worked.
[6086.33s -> 6088.17s]  I don't, I don't, I don't, what the fuck?
[6088.17s -> 6090.46s]  I'm a crab.
[6090.46s -> 6090.78s]  All right.
[6090.78s -> 6091.50s]  Should I get out of the way?
[6091.50s -> 6091.98s]  Go in the water.
[6092.54s -> 6098.49s]  I have to hold it?
[6098.49s -> 6098.81s]  I did.
[6098.81s -> 6102.91s]  I swear to God.
[6102.91s -> 6104.03s]  Good luck in Tokyo.
[6104.03s -> 6106.25s]  Yeah, I'll write to you.
[6106.89s -> 6107.21s]  Yeah.
[6119.55s -> 6132.16s]  Uh, that's fucking, that was creepy.
[6132.80s -> 6139.50s]  It's like, I'm making sure you're actually on the train in the seat.
[6139.50s -> 6139.98s]  For what?
[6139.98s -> 6141.64s]  For some reason.
[6141.64s -> 6143.64s]  Like, I got to make sure you're actually sitting down doing that
[6143.64s -> 6146.60s]  because I'm about to go this way real fast and, and do something.
[6147.16s -> 6147.96s]  It's weird.
[6147.96s -> 6149.64s]  Why would you need to, it's weird.
[6153.92s -> 6154.96s]  Psychotic behavior.
[6155.76s -> 6160.24s]  Hey, where are the dentists?
[6160.24s -> 6162.08s]  Raise your hand if you feel any pain.
[6162.08s -> 6167.08s]  We're almost done.
[6167.08s -> 6168.76s]  This hurts a little more.
[6168.76s -> 6169.32s]  It hurts.
[6169.96s -> 6170.52s]  It hurts.
[6171.48s -> 6174.28s]  You didn't give me an Innova can, you fucking monster doctor.
[6174.28s -> 6175.00s]  What are you doing?
[6178.65s -> 6179.21s]  It hurts.
[6193.20s -> 6193.52s]  Wait.
[6193.52s -> 6194.00s]  Oh no.
[6194.00s -> 6194.32s]  Okay.
[6194.88s -> 6196.08s]  I was like, where should I go?
[6196.80s -> 6201.82s]  Is it inconsiderate to say you're in pain?
[6201.82s -> 6202.54s]  That's what I'm saying.
[6202.54s -> 6203.02s]  Like what?
[6203.66s -> 6207.76s]  If a dentist is just drilling my mouth and it hurts, I'm going to go like this.
[6211.40s -> 6211.72s]  Right?
[6211.72s -> 6212.36s]  Wait, hold on.
[6218.83s -> 6219.39s]  Got it.
[6219.39s -> 6220.03s]  Nice.
[6220.03s -> 6222.56s]  Yeah.
[6222.56s -> 6223.60s]  You make an audible like.
[6227.02s -> 6230.78s]  If somebody's drilling inside your mouth, you do not want to make a bunch of movements.
[6231.42s -> 6240.38s]  Like if somebody has a drill sticking out of your fucking mouth,
[6240.38s -> 6243.13s]  I don't want to be like, oh, that hurt me.
[6243.13s -> 6243.85s]  Ouchies.
[6243.85s -> 6244.81s]  No, that they'll fuck.
[6244.81s -> 6245.53s]  No way.
[6245.53s -> 6246.17s]  You go like this.
[6248.16s -> 6251.24s]  And then they go, fuck.
[6251.24s -> 6251.56s]  Okay.
[6251.56s -> 6251.88s]  All right.
[6252.68s -> 6256.81s]  Turn the wind down.
[6256.81s -> 6266.04s]  And then when you hear the drill, power down.
[6266.04s -> 6266.60s]  They look at you.
[6266.60s -> 6267.16s]  Everything okay?
[6267.16s -> 6283.21s]  And then you go, oh, I hurt because he's still afraid something back it up.
[6283.21s -> 6284.49s]  Oh my God.
[6284.49s -> 6286.09s]  That was a lot of power.
[6287.21s -> 6288.33s]  I was not expecting that.
[6300.70s -> 6302.22s]  Dude, that's weird.
[6303.02s -> 6305.32s]  Am I supposed to be falling off?
[6305.32s -> 6310.36s]  No, I think I said to get it.
[6314.72s -> 6319.00s]  Downloading 27%.
[6319.88s -> 6321.61s]  How would it go backwards?
[6329.42s -> 6332.22s]  That made no sense.
[6332.22s -> 6334.30s]  I pressed to like, I was trying to.
[6334.30s -> 6335.18s]  That made no sense.
[6335.74s -> 6337.26s]  Okay.
[6337.26s -> 6337.98s]  Look at this graph.
[6337.98s -> 6338.78s]  I was trying to fill it.
[6340.35s -> 6341.55s]  They made apps of fucking.
[6341.55s -> 6342.83s]  The guy's fly is done.
[6358.68s -> 6363.10s]  Broccoli broccoli.
[6363.10s -> 6366.62s]  And then the ketchup and then I don't.
[6366.62s -> 6367.66s]  What am I looking at here?
[6367.66s -> 6368.30s]  This food.
[6370.52s -> 6371.64s]  What the fuck?
[6371.64s -> 6375.64s]  Oh, I'm putting a condiment on my food.
[6375.64s -> 6378.84s]  I thought I was selecting what food I wanted to eat first in what order.
[6379.48s -> 6381.56s]  This cow is so cute.
[6381.56s -> 6386.40s]  Yeah, let's get some lunch.
[6386.40s -> 6387.12s]  I'm starving.
[6387.68s -> 6396.38s]  Why are we crying?
[6396.94s -> 6412.43s]  That was sad.
[6412.99s -> 6416.35s]  A comment.
[6416.91s -> 6423.60s]  Oh, I like this.
[6423.60s -> 6424.64s]  I liked this video.
[6425.20s -> 6431.88s]  I guess I have a date with my boyfriend today.
[6431.88s -> 6432.12s]  Okay.
[6433.48s -> 6448.01s]  I mean, it's fine.
[6448.01s -> 6454.30s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[6454.30s -> 6456.06s]  Going in the haunted house with your boyfriend.
[6459.32s -> 6459.96s]  It's scary.
[6464.67s -> 6465.15s]  Hold me.
[6468.35s -> 6468.91s]  What?
[6468.91s -> 6471.87s]  Why are we putting our hands up?
[6471.87s -> 6480.65s]  Why did he, why was he freaked out by that?
[6480.65s -> 6482.97s]  Next up, a roller coaster with my boyfriend.
[6483.61s -> 6484.65s]  Here we go.
[6484.65s -> 6485.21s]  We're going to have fun.
[6492.83s -> 6499.20s]  Whoa, that was crazy.
[6499.84s -> 6501.16s]  Did you have fun?
[6512.48s -> 6514.72s]  Oh, you, you listen to it too together.
[6515.44s -> 6523.77s]  That's always like a nice thing to do.
[6524.41s -> 6530.89s]  But unfortunately, it's like really impractical because if usually you'll forget, it's the,
[6530.89s -> 6532.49s]  it's really this far, right?
[6532.49s -> 6534.01s]  You don't have very much distance.
[6534.01s -> 6538.43s]  So, so one of the two will forget that it's in and just be like, oh, cool.
[6538.43s -> 6539.79s]  And go over here.
[6539.79s -> 6544.19s]  And it like essentially like fucking strangles the person and like rips out of their ear
[6544.19s -> 6548.52s]  and shit just simply by tilting your head like, like this.
[6549.53s -> 6550.33s]  It sucks.
[6550.33s -> 6556.48s]  I'm surprised they haven't made like just a quad earbud thing at this point.
[6556.48s -> 6558.48s]  Like to prevent this from happening.
[6558.48s -> 6560.16s]  Why not just have like a, I mean, you can get a splitter,
[6560.16s -> 6563.60s]  but why not make one that's just like four so we can both listen.
[6565.50s -> 6568.30s]  I have that wireless.
[6569.23s -> 6571.63s]  No, but I want to be connected.
[6571.63s -> 6573.71s]  Wireless means we can literally sit across the fucking room.
[6574.35s -> 6577.31s]  If you have a TV or something, or you have like a big iPad or phone,
[6577.31s -> 6578.67s]  I can like sit over here.
[6578.67s -> 6582.27s]  I want to be like close, but not constricted.
[6582.27s -> 6583.15s]  You understand?
[6583.15s -> 6585.08s]  Because then one of us can go like this.
[6585.08s -> 6591.21s]  You know, one of us can be like, oh, look at this.
[6591.21s -> 6596.40s]  And they're like, oh, that's cute.
[6597.77s -> 6598.41s]  That's the fuck.
[6598.41s -> 6598.73s]  Come on.
[6598.73s -> 6599.93s]  You guys don't know how to be cute.
[6599.93s -> 6600.49s]  Give me a break.
[6607.44s -> 6608.48s]  It's time to pay the bill.
[6610.86s -> 6612.22s]  Oh, no, no, it's okay.
[6612.22s -> 6612.78s]  All right, fine.
[6613.34s -> 6614.75s]  You can pay for it.
[6623.55s -> 6624.35s]  I got a date tomorrow.
[6624.35s -> 6625.07s]  Tomorrow's the field trip.
[6625.07s -> 6626.35s]  Tomorrow's the outdoor concert.
[6626.99s -> 6629.79s]  I'm not going to like attack with a fucking tornado.
[6630.43s -> 6641.56s]  There we go.
[6641.56s -> 6649.82s]  Just enough for me to drop the fucking energy beam, right?
[6651.77s -> 6654.17s]  There comes, there comes a monster attack.
[6662.78s -> 6663.50s]  What's today's date?
[6664.06s -> 6665.90s]  Oh shit.
[6665.90s -> 6667.18s]  No, I'll take, I'll take the one that's half off.
[6673.42s -> 6675.02s]  Thanks, demon weather god.
[6679.05s -> 6681.21s]  Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
[6685.48s -> 6686.44s]  Yeah, you can take that.
[6686.44s -> 6687.00s]  You can do it.
[6687.00s -> 6687.48s]  That's fine.
[6688.20s -> 6691.23s]  It really depends on how far away you are.
[6696.22s -> 6700.06s]  If, okay, if I can see you across the grocery store
[6700.06s -> 6702.43s]  and you're making your way here, I'm going in front of you.
[6702.43s -> 6710.56s]  If you are within like 10 to 15 feet, then yeah, I'll do that.
[6710.56s -> 6715.55s]  But I'm sorry, if you, if you're like across the whole store,
[6715.55s -> 6717.15s]  I don't know, you could be going to a different aisle.
[6717.15s -> 6717.79s]  I don't know.
[6717.79s -> 6730.04s]  And you're yelling, hurry up.
[6730.04s -> 6733.60s]  That was you and me talking about that.
[6733.60s -> 6734.80s]  I wouldn't, that, hold on.
[6734.80s -> 6735.76s]  First of all, what's going on?
[6737.42s -> 6737.98s]  Excuse me.
[6738.54s -> 6739.02s]  Excuse me.
[6739.66s -> 6740.38s]  Excuse me.
[6740.38s -> 6740.86s]  Excuse me.
[6740.86s -> 6741.50s]  Pay attention.
[6741.50s -> 6741.98s]  Excuse me.
[6741.98s -> 6742.46s]  Pay attention.
[6743.10s -> 6743.90s]  Pay attention.
[6743.90s -> 6751.64s]  Can I turn around and say like, watch where you're fucking going?
[6751.64s -> 6753.00s]  Camping experience tour.
[6753.00s -> 6753.72s]  Start a fire.
[6756.67s -> 6759.23s]  Get a fire going before I, should I put the sun out?
[6759.23s -> 6765.80s]  Get a fire going so I can go to bed.
[6768.48s -> 6771.13s]  Get a fire started.
[6771.13s -> 6772.41s]  They just suck.
[6772.41s -> 6776.08s]  Consider it.
[6776.08s -> 6777.44s]  The title is partially displayed.
[6777.44s -> 6783.76s]  Wait, are we playing the game?
[6783.76s -> 6784.72s]  Oh, consider it together.
[6784.72s -> 6786.16s]  We're going to play the co-op.
[6791.40s -> 6799.16s]  You became stranded.
[6799.16s -> 6801.16s]  Do I keep, I gotta keep him awake?
[6801.16s -> 6815.60s]  Could you get us some tea, please?
[6815.60s -> 6817.24s]  Sure.
[6817.24s -> 6818.12s]  Green tea.
[6818.12s -> 6824.32s]  That's what they wanted, right?
[6824.32s -> 6832.20s]  Okay, here you go.
[6832.20s -> 6832.44s]  What?
[6832.44s -> 6832.92s]  What'd I do?
[6840.78s -> 6841.02s]  Okay.
[6841.58s -> 6843.02s]  And you make mine a little sweet.
[6843.02s -> 6843.34s]  Got it.
[6846.83s -> 6847.15s]  One.
[6847.15s -> 6847.55s]  That's it.
[6848.11s -> 6851.72s]  People are weird about sugar in their coffee.
[6852.28s -> 6855.20s]  Some people take one sip of something with one sugar in it
[6855.20s -> 6856.16s]  and they like want to spit it out.
[6856.96s -> 6860.32s]  And some people want like 50 sugars in it
[6860.32s -> 6861.84s]  and they think it tastes bland.
[6861.84s -> 6863.44s]  I don't even know what the fuck they were just saying.
[6863.44s -> 6863.76s]  Heaven.
[6869.84s -> 6871.20s]  I don't do sugar for people.
[6871.20s -> 6871.44s]  Ever.
[6875.26s -> 6876.30s]  If somebody ever tells you,
[6876.30s -> 6878.46s]  oh yeah, you just put some sugar in it for me.
[6878.46s -> 6880.03s]  You go, no.
[6880.03s -> 6881.63s]  You bring over a few of sugars
[6881.63s -> 6883.87s]  or a few packets of whatever or like sweetener
[6883.87s -> 6884.91s]  and you just say, here you go.
[6885.71s -> 6886.91s]  I'm not responsible for that
[6886.91s -> 6887.71s]  because people don't like it.
[6895.16s -> 6896.36s]  Turtles are so slow.
[6896.36s -> 6897.64s]  Whoa, that's not true.
[6898.36s -> 6901.66s]  Wanna race me?
[6903.84s -> 6904.16s]  Sure.
[6904.72s -> 6910.62s]  They didn't tell me it was Mario Kart.
[6910.62s -> 6914.84s]  Oh, I just like killed the turtle and the bunny.
[6919.69s -> 6920.65s]  I win.
[6920.65s -> 6923.45s]  That's the most important part.
[6923.45s -> 6946.68s]  I'm trying to switch them.
[6947.32s -> 6951.76s]  Were we together?
[6958.11s -> 6959.79s]  Uh, just to come out of the snow?
[6961.79s -> 6966.14s]  What's considerate about that?
[6966.14s -> 6967.26s]  Oh shit, Darth Vader.
[6967.90s -> 6974.08s]  How long does it need to be?
[6974.72s -> 6975.60s]  Make it like a spear.
[6976.16s -> 6981.15s]  Okay.
[6981.15s -> 6985.40s]  Would you get us some tea, please?
[6985.40s -> 6986.20s]  Yes, I can.
[6986.20s -> 6998.17s]  How do I stop pouring?
[6998.17s -> 6999.37s]  How do I stop pouring?
[6999.37s -> 6999.77s]  There we go.
[7007.31s -> 7008.43s]  You hear that.
[7008.43s -> 7009.31s]  How do I stop pouring?
[7009.31s -> 7010.75s]  I don't know how to stop pouring.
[7010.75s -> 7011.92s]  I don't understand.
[7011.92s -> 7016.44s]  How do I stop?
[7016.44s -> 7018.12s]  Whoa, that's a little too much though.
[7018.12s -> 7019.24s]  That's not considerate.
[7019.24s -> 7033.16s]  Well, it didn't do the thing where you stand in front.
[7033.16s -> 7036.43s]  So you get them moving
[7036.43s -> 7038.35s]  and then you go into the front.
[7038.35s -> 7040.51s]  So you stand in front of them while they're going like this
[7040.51s -> 7042.75s]  and you go like, no, whoa!
[7042.75s -> 7043.47s]  When they get close
[7043.47s -> 7045.47s]  and you pretend like you got flew backwards from them.
[7045.47s -> 7047.20s]  You're not doing that.
[7047.20s -> 7058.03s]  That's inconsiderate.
[7058.03s -> 7058.67s]  All right.
[7058.67s -> 7059.47s]  Considerate.
[7059.47s -> 7061.07s]  Which considerate is this?
[7061.07s -> 7061.71s]  Three.
[7061.71s -> 7069.23s]  What was he talking about?
[7069.23s -> 7071.07s]  Do I have to explain that?
[7071.07s -> 7071.71s]  I'm a guide bot.
[7071.71s -> 7073.39s]  If you want to know where to go, just ask me.
[7073.39s -> 7077.08s]  People always force me to work.
[7077.08s -> 7078.52s]  I'll revenge you one day.
[7082.03s -> 7082.59s]  Lost kid.
[7083.47s -> 7084.11s]  Lost.
[7084.11s -> 7084.59s]  Go that way.
[7085.15s -> 7087.92s]  That way.
[7087.92s -> 7101.95s]  Going to the arcade with my boyfriend.
[7102.97s -> 7103.45s]  Punch.
[7103.45s -> 7103.77s]  Fight.
[7105.88s -> 7107.24s]  The boyfriend did it really well.
[7107.24s -> 7108.76s]  Should I go lower?
[7114.54s -> 7115.42s]  Way stronger.
[7115.42s -> 7115.74s]  All right.
[7115.74s -> 7116.94s]  That's all right.
[7116.94s -> 7117.50s]  Whatever.
[7117.50s -> 7120.00s]  It wasn't my fault,
[7120.00s -> 7121.84s]  but I have to apologize in the next three seconds.
[7122.65s -> 7124.17s]  What button is apologize?
[7124.17s -> 7127.50s]  It was left.
[7127.50s -> 7139.26s]  It was left.
[7139.26s -> 7139.74s]  What is that?
[7140.38s -> 7141.72s]  I don't know what this is.
[7142.44s -> 7147.55s]  They put it out.
[7150.20s -> 7151.16s]  I don't know what that was.
[7151.16s -> 7152.52s]  It was a fireworks sparkler.
[7152.52s -> 7153.80s]  Why would I be holding it upside down?
[7156.22s -> 7157.74s]  Who holds it like this?
[7158.54s -> 7159.10s]  Like that.
[7159.10s -> 7159.58s]  What are you?
[7159.58s -> 7160.06s]  Out of your mind?
[7167.34s -> 7169.10s]  You became stranded again.
[7178.12s -> 7179.72s]  Buddy, you're a boy.
[7179.72s -> 7180.36s]  I can't do this.
[7180.36s -> 7181.24s]  Nobody can do that.
[7181.24s -> 7183.66s]  That's what I'm supposed to do.
[7183.66s -> 7188.70s]  Not even going to attempt.
[7188.70s -> 7190.22s]  I'm not doing another like singing thing
[7190.22s -> 7191.26s]  and get all fucked up from it.
[7192.25s -> 7193.53s]  Working from home today.
[7193.53s -> 7199.77s]  Some rest.
[7199.77s -> 7202.88s]  It was almost a funny number.
[7202.88s -> 7204.28s]  Uh-oh.
[7204.84s -> 7205.32s]  Not good.
[7205.32s -> 7205.88s]  Not good.
[7206.76s -> 7207.96s]  Can't hold it in.
[7207.96s -> 7211.87s]  Can't hold who?
[7213.69s -> 7214.41s]  Oh, shit.
[7214.41s -> 7215.93s]  I'm going to the bathroom.
[7215.93s -> 7226.11s]  Okay.
[7226.11s -> 7226.83s]  Little flush.
[7226.83s -> 7228.51s]  What are you doing for your birthday?
[7228.51s -> 7232.44s]  Maybe I should start preparing something.
[7232.44s -> 7234.52s]  Now, if you want to hide,
[7234.52s -> 7235.56s]  you want to hide,
[7235.56s -> 7237.80s]  here's a pro tip for all of you.
[7237.80s -> 7239.45s]  If you want to hide
[7239.45s -> 7240.09s]  and you're like,
[7240.09s -> 7240.97s]  holy shit,
[7240.97s -> 7241.77s]  what am I going to do?
[7242.49s -> 7243.53s]  I'm in the bathroom right now.
[7243.53s -> 7245.21s]  I don't want them to hear me in the bathroom.
[7245.21s -> 7246.01s]  Okay.
[7246.01s -> 7246.81s]  Here's what you have to do.
[7247.45s -> 7248.57s]  You do a flush.
[7249.47s -> 7250.59s]  You hold that thing down.
[7250.59s -> 7251.95s]  You do a big fucking flush.
[7252.51s -> 7254.83s]  And when you hear the like,
[7254.83s -> 7255.71s]  go, go, go, go, go,
[7255.71s -> 7257.23s]  it going into the tank,
[7257.23s -> 7259.32s]  like down into the tube.
[7259.32s -> 7260.28s]  That's when you shit.
[7260.28s -> 7262.72s]  You should go, you shit right there.
[7262.72s -> 7263.52s]  The sound will,
[7263.52s -> 7264.16s]  it'll be masked.
[7264.16s -> 7265.92s]  It'll be sounding like the end of the toilet.
[7265.92s -> 7266.42s]  Like that.
[7267.36s -> 7269.42s]  Trust me.
[7269.42s -> 7270.22s]  If you time it right,
[7270.22s -> 7271.74s]  no one will fucking ever know what happened.
[7271.74s -> 7278.67s]  I'm eating.
[7279.23s -> 7282.43s]  Happy birthday.
[7283.07s -> 7284.12s]  Blow my candle up.
[7286.14s -> 7286.78s]  How cute.
[7286.78s -> 7287.82s]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[7287.82s -> 7288.32s]  What?
[7289.10s -> 7289.82s]  I couldn't do it.
[7289.82s -> 7291.02s]  Oh, I'm the candle.
[7291.82s -> 7293.37s]  How do I go back up?
[7294.84s -> 7295.64s]  I can't.
[7295.64s -> 7297.08s]  I'm holding up arrow right now.
[7297.08s -> 7298.36s]  All I can do is hold down.
[7298.36s -> 7308.44s]  That was wicked fucked up.
[7308.44s -> 7309.16s]  The thing I just said,
[7309.16s -> 7310.04s]  but whatever.
[7310.04s -> 7311.36s]  It works.
[7311.82s -> 7313.13s]  Be careful.
[7313.13s -> 7313.61s]  Don't go too,
[7313.61s -> 7314.25s]  you got to be gentle.
[7319.10s -> 7325.26s]  You want more slices?
[7325.98s -> 7329.61s]  What kind of weirdo?
[7330.17s -> 7335.93s]  Okay.
[7335.93s -> 7336.76s]  Hello.
[7337.85s -> 7338.73s]  I'm ZZ,
[7338.73s -> 7340.01s]  the VTuber.
[7340.01s -> 7341.21s]  Just have to adjust a few settings.
[7341.21s -> 7341.93s]  Hold on a second.
[7365.42s -> 7366.06s]  Extra large.
[7366.06s -> 7367.50s]  I brought my own bottle.
[7367.50s -> 7368.46s]  Extra large.
[7368.46s -> 7372.91s]  All right.
[7372.91s -> 7373.39s]  That's enough.
[7373.39s -> 7374.83s]  You don't need to take the whole goddamn thing.
[7375.47s -> 7387.47s]  That's how I feel when you put the cam on.
[7387.47s -> 7388.35s]  Oh, get out of here.
[7388.35s -> 7389.15s]  Train your brain.
[7391.08s -> 7393.16s]  Guess how many people are left in the house?
[7393.16s -> 7395.63s]  One, two, three.
[7400.48s -> 7401.68s]  There could have been people in there before.
[7402.24s -> 7403.24s]  Three.
[7403.24s -> 7406.81s]  There's one person left.
[7406.81s -> 7407.53s]  I don't know.
[7407.53s -> 7408.33s]  Input your answer.
[7409.74s -> 7410.62s]  I, but it didn't,
[7410.62s -> 7411.66s]  I don't have all the info though.
[7412.46s -> 7412.78s]  Right?
[7412.78s -> 7414.22s]  Like there could be somebody actually in there still.
[7414.22s -> 7415.50s]  It could be somebody else's house.
[7415.50s -> 7421.64s]  Oh, 911.
[7431.47s -> 7433.47s]  I'm for the explosion scene.
[7433.47s -> 7435.63s]  I mean, it's everything with explosions.
[7435.63s -> 7436.59s]  There's only one chance.
[7437.39s -> 7442.00s]  You got it.
[7442.00s -> 7445.60s]  That was perfect.
[7445.60s -> 7447.32s]  That was perfect.
[7447.88s -> 7451.53s]  Would you get us some tea, please?
[7451.53s -> 7451.77s]  Yes.
[7454.51s -> 7455.63s]  Water, milk.
[7455.63s -> 7456.75s]  How do I, how do I make tea?
[7457.47s -> 7459.15s]  There's no tea.
[7459.15s -> 7462.04s]  Is there tea bags?
[7465.55s -> 7466.51s]  Where's tea?
[7466.51s -> 7471.42s]  There's no tea.
[7472.14s -> 7476.08s]  I haven't lunch with a client today.
[7476.72s -> 7478.54s]  Okay.
[7478.54s -> 7479.74s]  We're going to go to the family diner.
[7481.07s -> 7481.95s]  The cabaret?
[7486.76s -> 7487.24s]  I see.
[7488.60s -> 7489.64s]  Please take care of it.
[7490.28s -> 7494.22s]  Understood.
[7494.22s -> 7516.65s]  It's like a chatter.
[7517.93s -> 7518.67s]  All right.
[7518.67s -> 7519.15s]  Watch out.
[7520.03s -> 7525.05s]  What do I do?
[7532.57s -> 7537.34s]  Um, oh, it's, I'm the bullet.
[7537.98s -> 7539.98s]  Nice job.
[7547.34s -> 7549.74s]  But like, I, the water is probably considerate, right?
[7550.46s -> 7553.66s]  I would think so.
[7561.84s -> 7563.76s]  Uh, catch this person.
[7564.40s -> 7569.15s]  I don't know if that was considered or not.
[7569.15s -> 7581.15s]  The end.
[7581.15s -> 7582.03s]  Oh, right.
[7582.67s -> 7584.83s]  No, but I, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[7584.83s -> 7586.75s]  I, look at, look at me, look at me.
[7587.39s -> 7591.42s]  During the credits, what you do is you slowly start to get up.
[7591.42s -> 7593.66s]  You start to do the thing where everyone starts to stretch a little bit.
[7594.30s -> 7595.58s]  You get into the aisle.
[7597.31s -> 7599.87s]  What's the fuck is going, what?
[7600.59s -> 7604.67s]  Turn the cam off.
[7604.67s -> 7605.39s]  Turn the cam off.
[7607.28s -> 7610.36s]  Um, anyways.
[7610.36s -> 7613.72s]  Everybody gets up and you slowly make your way into the aisle
[7613.72s -> 7616.76s]  and you just walk like one mile per hour.
[7617.40s -> 7618.84s]  You walk so slow.
[7619.93s -> 7620.57s]  What am I doing here?
[7624.24s -> 7624.64s]  Exit.
[7628.97s -> 7630.49s]  Oh, it was the kids wanted me to do that.
[7630.49s -> 7631.13s]  Okay.
[7631.13s -> 7644.30s]  That it?
[7644.30s -> 7647.34s]  That what I, I got my fingers all over the sauce.
[7647.34s -> 7649.64s]  All right, that's fucking disgusting.
[7650.91s -> 7652.91s]  I would actually be pissed about that.
[7652.91s -> 7657.87s]  What am I doing with my hands?
[7657.87s -> 7661.55s]  Why is it no like fork or chopsticks or utensil or what?
[7661.55s -> 7662.11s]  I don't understand.
[7662.84s -> 7665.32s]  Why would I be dipping sushi like that with my hands?
[7669.28s -> 7669.68s]  Fork?
[7669.68s -> 7670.16s]  I don't know.
[7670.88s -> 7672.56s]  I use chopsticks.
[7672.56s -> 7676.06s]  It's the traditional way.
[7676.06s -> 7676.78s]  What?
[7676.78s -> 7679.05s]  Eating sushi with your hand?
[7683.12s -> 7684.72s]  I'd never ask for a fork.
[7684.72s -> 7686.56s]  I always use chopsticks.
[7686.56s -> 7687.68s]  I know how to use them.
[7687.68s -> 7693.61s]  You eat sushi with your hands.
[7693.61s -> 7695.05s]  It's a hand food.
[7695.05s -> 7696.75s]  That's the traditional way.
[7698.32s -> 7700.73s]  Oh, prove it.
[7700.73s -> 7707.31s]  When we come back from break, after this game is done,
[7707.31s -> 7711.15s]  I'll, I'll go get chopsticks and I'll show you that I can use them.
[7711.88s -> 7712.52s]  Fine.
[7712.52s -> 7714.30s]  Fine.
[7718.30s -> 7719.18s]  Fork works better.
[7720.14s -> 7721.74s]  I'm, don't say that.
[7721.74s -> 7722.14s]  Watch out.
[7722.14s -> 7725.26s]  I'm very, everyone's really upset about you for saying that.
[7725.26s -> 7730.72s]  Would it be, what am I doing?
[7730.72s -> 7732.32s]  I'm drinking a lot of drinks.
[7732.32s -> 7735.64s]  Only just drink two.
[7735.64s -> 7737.84s]  When it comes to men, there are just so many of them.
[7738.40s -> 7742.41s]  I'm sure there's someone out there, yeah, who can see me from where I am.
[7742.41s -> 7742.81s]  That's right.
[7743.37s -> 7746.38s]  Two drinks, no more than that.
[7746.38s -> 7749.07s]  Will you back me up?
[7749.07s -> 7768.06s]  I'm sorry, but like, get out of the fucking way.
[7768.06s -> 7773.21s]  I didn't mean to bump you, but like, I'm very clearly way ahead of you by now.
[7773.21s -> 7774.41s]  But get out of the fucking way.
[7774.41s -> 7775.77s]  You don't own the sidewalk, fuck off.
[7776.33s -> 7780.27s]  You don't own the sidewalk, fuck off.
[7780.27s -> 7792.52s]  Am I waiting for somebody?
[7793.08s -> 7795.92s]  Am I waiting for someone?
[7796.56s -> 7800.44s]  It looked like she was waiting for somebody.
[7802.84s -> 7804.20s]  I'm going to set off the fireworks.
[7804.20s -> 7806.36s]  Timing is everything with fireworks.
[7806.36s -> 7808.11s]  I had a great time today.
[7811.37s -> 7820.60s]  Um, uh, shit, I have to fill it.
[7820.60s -> 7821.56s]  Please marry me.
[7828.14s -> 7829.82s]  I'm giving you material to work with.
[7832.86s -> 7833.90s]  Uh, sure.
[7833.90s -> 7842.40s]  This is weird.
[7842.40s -> 7848.62s]  Are we dancing?
[7848.62s -> 7852.35s]  What am I doing?
[7852.99s -> 7856.65s]  This is something that like really has to pee.
[7856.65s -> 7858.33s]  I don't understand what I'm supposed to be doing.
[7858.33s -> 7864.43s]  Oh, all right.
[7864.43s -> 7866.99s]  But let me, let me defend myself for the last thing I said.
[7866.99s -> 7874.28s]  So if you're taking up a whole sidewalk, like if you look, if you want to stop and,
[7874.28s -> 7874.92s]  oh, look at that.
[7874.92s -> 7876.12s]  Let's look, we're sightseeing.
[7876.12s -> 7876.76s]  That's fine.
[7876.76s -> 7877.24s]  That's great.
[7877.80s -> 7881.15s]  But like, if you're not going to take a picture, right?
[7881.15s -> 7884.75s]  If you're not taking, oh, hey, let me get a good photo of that.
[7884.75s -> 7885.55s]  Go over there.
[7885.55s -> 7885.95s]  Oh, cool.
[7885.95s -> 7886.11s]  Yeah.
[7886.11s -> 7886.83s]  How about right here?
[7886.83s -> 7887.31s]  Right?
[7887.31s -> 7890.62s]  You give people the space to like, okay, you can take a photo.
[7890.62s -> 7894.54s]  But if you're just sitting there standing in the middle of like, and blocking the whole way,
[7895.10s -> 7898.14s]  there's nothing in my, nothing I can do to make you leave or make you move.
[7898.14s -> 7898.86s]  Right?
[7898.86s -> 7900.46s]  So it's, it's, it's inconsiderate.
[7901.02s -> 7902.91s]  That's very inconsiderate.
[7902.91s -> 7906.35s]  If you are with somebody and there's people behind you that are just walking,
[7906.99s -> 7908.59s]  you go, oh, that's really cool.
[7908.91s -> 7909.79s]  Come over here for a sec.
[7909.79s -> 7912.99s]  Like you step kind of on the edge and like, oh, yeah, yeah, cool.
[7912.99s -> 7913.15s]  Good.
[7913.15s -> 7915.07s]  People are just walking by one, two, three.
[7915.07s -> 7915.31s]  All right.
[7915.31s -> 7918.27s]  We've got a gap of like this, like not a person for like another minute, two minutes.
[7918.99s -> 7922.19s]  Let's go back into the sidewalk and fucking look around.
[7922.19s -> 7923.07s]  There we are.
[7923.07s -> 7925.60s]  You got to be aware of people walking on the sidewalk.
[7925.60s -> 7929.85s]  Otherwise you get a situation with someone.
[7929.85s -> 7930.81s]  You don't know what somebody has to be.
[7932.44s -> 7934.12s]  Throw the sword out, defend thyself.
[7938.70s -> 7939.82s]  Okay, Mr. David.
[7947.76s -> 7949.20s]  There was an honest woodcutter.
[7950.27s -> 7952.19s]  One day he dropped his precious axe in a lake.
[7952.19s -> 7954.91s]  A goddess then returned it to him or maybe not.
[7955.31s -> 7956.59s]  What kind of axe did you drop?
[7956.59s -> 7958.75s]  A golden axe or a silver axe?
[7958.75s -> 7960.24s]  Or was it this?
[7960.80s -> 7965.68s]  I mean, this is, this is a lot.
[7965.68s -> 7967.12s]  I can't lie to like a goddess.
[7967.12s -> 7967.60s]  They'll know.
[7969.31s -> 7971.87s]  Now they give me the golden one because I was truthful.
[7971.87s -> 7974.91s]  That's how this works.
[7974.91s -> 7984.11s]  I'm going to sneeze.
[7988.24s -> 7988.88s]  Okay.
[7988.88s -> 7989.92s]  I don't know if I got it or not.
[7989.92s -> 7990.40s]  I might have.
[7991.12s -> 7997.08s]  Hopefully I got it.
[7997.64s -> 8006.43s]  Train your brain.
[8006.99s -> 8008.72s]  What do you see?
[8008.72s -> 8009.52s]  Answer in English.
[8010.24s -> 8016.94s]  Apple.
[8016.94s -> 8030.40s]  Carrie.
[8030.40s -> 8032.48s]  I really like that lion having sex joke.
[8033.12s -> 8037.45s]  Okay.
[8037.45s -> 8038.73s]  I'm pregnant.
[8038.73s -> 8040.01s]  So I'm going to sit down.
[8041.28s -> 8041.92s]  Oh, sit down.
[8043.90s -> 8044.30s]  Thank you.
[8052.49s -> 8053.53s]  Why are the animals in here?
[8055.34s -> 8055.58s]  You.
[8062.76s -> 8063.48s]  That was bizarre.
[8063.48s -> 8063.80s]  I don't know.
[8065.96s -> 8067.40s]  Very vaguely considerate.
[8067.40s -> 8069.10s]  Down to the last five.
[8069.10s -> 8079.90s]  What am I doing?
[8079.90s -> 8080.46s]  Whoa.
[8080.46s -> 8080.78s]  Whoa.
[8080.78s -> 8081.02s]  What?
[8081.66s -> 8082.14s]  I don't get it.
[8083.15s -> 8083.95s]  Oh, shit.
[8083.95s -> 8084.27s]  Okay.
[8084.83s -> 8090.20s]  I think I have to get this all the way across.
[8090.20s -> 8103.24s]  All right.
[8103.24s -> 8103.88s]  Got it.
[8103.88s -> 8106.70s]  Another one.
[8106.70s -> 8131.32s]  When should I wake?
[8131.32s -> 8132.04s]  Three?
[8132.04s -> 8132.84s]  What time do I wake?
[8132.84s -> 8133.88s]  I don't know when to wake it up.
[8138.94s -> 8143.15s]  Did I not have done that?
[8143.15s -> 8147.87s]  I don't know.
[8147.87s -> 8149.23s]  We're running like a schedule.
[8149.23s -> 8150.03s]  Okay.
[8150.03s -> 8150.99s]  We need a baby.
[8150.99s -> 8151.79s]  Everybody in the frame.
[8151.79s -> 8152.83s]  Everyone's looking.
[8152.83s -> 8153.40s]  Got it.
[8153.40s -> 8154.84s]  Well, you weren't that happy, but it's all right.
[8154.84s -> 8156.36s]  At least we're all looking in the right direction.
[8156.36s -> 8162.27s]  You woke the baby up at 3 a.m.
[8162.27s -> 8167.95s]  Hey, you.
[8167.95s -> 8169.63s]  My, how the time flies.
[8169.63s -> 8174.78s]  You're already three.
[8174.78s -> 8181.95s]  It seems that my time as a mother will pass in a flash.
[8182.51s -> 8187.79s]  Got nothing to say about this one.
[8188.35s -> 8192.75s]  I had a dream yesterday.
[8193.39s -> 8225.85s]  You say that's more like me.
[8225.85s -> 8226.89s]  That might be so.
[8226.89s -> 8230.57s]  I wonder if one day this child will be considerate too.
[8234.40s -> 8237.52s]  Nowadays, don't they say that being too considerate when it comes to others is a fault?
[8242.11s -> 8243.71s]  Since everyone's different, you need to be considerate.
[8243.71s -> 8244.03s]  You have...
[8247.04s -> 8248.08s]  Everybody, wait a minute.
[8249.71s -> 8252.24s]  He's going like...
[8252.24s -> 8252.72s]  I'm so...
[8252.72s -> 8253.36s]  I was fucking...
[8253.36s -> 8254.32s]  That was weird.
[8254.32s -> 8255.28s]  That was strange.
[8256.16s -> 8260.17s]  That was...
[8260.73s -> 8261.13s]  I...
[8261.13s -> 8262.49s]  That was fucking weird.
[8262.49s -> 8264.27s]  With somebody's leg?
[8268.84s -> 8269.48s]  Yeah, I know.
[8269.48s -> 8271.00s]  But like, it was fucking weird.
[8271.00s -> 8272.04s]  It was a weird spot.
[8272.97s -> 8274.33s]  That was in a weird spot.
[8274.33s -> 8284.83s]  All right.
[8284.83s -> 8289.02s]  Turn the page.
[8289.02s -> 8289.42s]  Dirty.
[8289.42s -> 8290.06s]  Oh, no.
[8290.06s -> 8293.18s]  I'm just saying like it was fucking jarring for a second.
[8293.18s -> 8293.74s]  I was just like...
[8293.74s -> 8295.98s]  So I thought it was like his arm down there.
[8295.98s -> 8297.10s]  But both of his arms are up here.
[8297.10s -> 8298.38s]  And there was another arm like coming up here.
[8298.38s -> 8299.02s]  It was a leg.
[8299.02s -> 8299.66s]  It was a knee.
[8303.77s -> 8304.17s]  All right.
[8304.17s -> 8305.69s]  Ban all conversations.
[8305.85s -> 8306.73s]  Ban all conversations.
[8306.73s -> 8308.01s]  Just lock it down right now.
[8308.01s -> 8308.73s]  Lock it down right now.
[8308.73s -> 8309.45s]  Lock it down quick.
[8310.09s -> 8310.89s]  Lock it down quick.
[8310.89s -> 8311.29s]  I've made...
[8311.29s -> 8312.09s]  I've ruined it.
[8312.09s -> 8312.65s]  But...
[8312.65s -> 8313.37s]  Lock it down.
[8313.37s -> 8314.41s]  Ban all conversations.
[8314.97s -> 8319.26s]  What do you mean?
[8319.26s -> 8340.99s]  Get over here.
[8340.99s -> 8341.71s]  How did we do?
[8343.52s -> 8345.44s]  Not that great with timing.
[8345.44s -> 8345.76s]  Okay.
[8347.52s -> 8350.88s]  Generally considerate, a kind-hearted hot pot maestro.
[8350.88s -> 8359.63s]  I want to see the detailed...
[8359.63s -> 8360.51s]  I couldn't even read the...
[8360.51s -> 8361.15s]  I hit tab.
[8361.15s -> 8361.95s]  It didn't do anything.
[8361.95s -> 8362.19s]  What?
[8368.96s -> 8369.36s]  Can I go...
[8369.36s -> 8369.92s]  Okay, here we go.
[8372.20s -> 8372.92s]  All right.
[8372.92s -> 8373.24s]  Whoa.
[8375.29s -> 8377.29s]  Disappointing in group dynamics in this one.
[8377.77s -> 8382.43s]  The knowledge to understand the role others expect you to play in a group.
[8383.07s -> 8387.16s]  I think so.
[8387.16s -> 8387.88s]  What about interval?
[8387.88s -> 8388.76s]  Good and bad intervals?
[8390.04s -> 8391.32s]  My spatial awareness is big.
[8392.04s -> 8392.68s]  Shut it down.
[8420.14s -> 8423.42s]  Not five minutes ago.
[8423.42s -> 8425.04s]  It was a scene.
[8425.76s -> 8427.68s]  It was lying down like this.
[8428.32s -> 8432.48s]  And there was a sensor bar down there covering me.
[8432.48s -> 8441.13s]  It was like a sensor thing on him.
[8441.13s -> 8443.21s]  And then it was like, oh, here's another photo of like,
[8443.21s -> 8444.17s]  dad or whatever.
[8444.17s -> 8445.37s]  Like going like this.
[8445.37s -> 8445.69s]  And I'm...
[8446.33s -> 8450.83s]  I have defenses here.
[8450.83s -> 8451.47s]  I have a defense.
[8466.24s -> 8467.04s]  What's wrong with you?
[8467.04s -> 8468.24s]  And nothing's wrong with me!
[8469.68s -> 8473.66s]  All right, so that was considerate.
[8474.38s -> 8475.76s]  That was considerate.
[8475.76s -> 8476.96s]  It was a really fun experience.
[8477.52s -> 8482.78s]  I had a great time.
[8482.78s -> 8484.20s]  There's nothing wrong with me.
[8484.20s -> 8485.56s]  There's nothing wrong with me.
[8485.56s -> 8488.88s]  I'm going to get chopsticks to prove to you that I can use them.
[8489.93s -> 8492.17s]  And then we're going to go from there.
[8492.17s -> 8493.93s]  We're going to play the Roswell game.
[8499.92s -> 8501.04s]  You failed every test.
[8501.04s -> 8501.52s]  I did not.
[8501.52s -> 8502.80s]  I got like a 70 on everything.
[8504.70s -> 8506.54s]  We're going to take a three-minute break.
[8506.54s -> 8507.34s]  I'm going to get some water.
[8507.98s -> 8508.54s]  I'm going to pee.
[8509.50s -> 8512.70s]  And we'll just switch to Roswell Agent, whatever it's called.
[8512.70s -> 8517.96s]  70 is a C.
[8518.76s -> 8520.32s]  That's fine.
[8520.32s -> 8521.12s]  I passed.
[8521.12s -> 8522.16s]  All right, I'll be right back.
[8522.16s -> 8522.80s]  See you guys in a minute.
[8522.80s -> 8524.08s]  We're going to play the Alien game.
[8524.08s -> 8524.96s]  That was considerate.
[8524.96s -> 8525.68s]  One, two, and three.
[8525.68s -> 8526.48s]  That was very fun.
[8526.48s -> 8527.36s]  It was very engaging.
[8527.36s -> 8528.00s]  I really liked it.
[8528.00s -> 8528.72s]  I thought it was really fun.
[8529.52s -> 8532.11s]  I think it's like 10 bucks for the whole series.
[8532.99s -> 8535.47s]  It might be like $12 for all three of those games.
[8535.47s -> 8539.47s]  So it's like, you know, get like a few hours of fun out of it.
[8539.47s -> 8540.51s]  Like 10 bucks.
[8540.51s -> 8541.15s]  Yeah, it was fun.
[8541.15s -> 8542.99s]  See you in a minute.
