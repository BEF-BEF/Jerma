[0.31s -> 21.87s]  Zoe looks terrible in this poster. She looks huge. She's got the same body shape. She has the same body shape as a pyro.
[21.87s -> 29.87s]  Alright boo, introduce this. Death tool. Hell came to earth. These four are gonna send it back.
[29.87s -> 31.87s]  That was awful.
[31.87s -> 34.11s]  Why did you say it like the demo man?
[34.11s -> 36.11s]  I had like eight different accents.
[40.61s -> 42.61s]  Let's pull this off boys.
[42.61s -> 44.61s]  Alright, I'm a boomer. I'll do what a boomer is.
[50.61s -> 52.61s]  You don't want to return to lobby.
[52.61s -> 55.61s]  Oh, like ping? Oh, ping, ping, ping.
[55.61s -> 58.17s]  Like who cares?
[58.17s -> 62.34s]  Oh, I don't know if this is... Well, okay.
[63.34s -> 65.34s]  Do you got to change the server?
[65.34s -> 67.34s]  But Zoe looks terrible in this poster.
[67.34s -> 69.34s]  You know what? She looks like the pyro.
[69.34s -> 71.65s]  I hate you.
[73.65s -> 77.65s]  What a stupid comment to make. Looks like the pyro. Get out of there. Get out.
[79.65s -> 84.65s]  Death tool. Hell came to earth. These four are gonna send it back.
[84.65s -> 90.65s]  I can't wait to play both those back to back. Like I'm gonna show the first one too.
[91.65s -> 94.14s]  You are the worst.
[95.14s -> 97.14s]  Those things are pretty horrible.
[97.14s -> 99.14s]  Oh, is it really?
[99.14s -> 101.14s]  Our things are great.
[103.83s -> 105.83s]  Sorry, I'll say no.
[105.83s -> 108.83s]  Alright, we're gonna try this one more time and that's it.
[109.83s -> 111.83s]  I'm sorry that they're awful.
[111.83s -> 115.35s]  Oh, gosh.
[115.35s -> 117.59s]  Welcome to Left 4 Dead 2.
[118.59s -> 121.41s]  You know what? I really think...
[124.41s -> 128.41s]  You know, she really looks like the pyro in this picture. Don't you guys think that?
[128.41s -> 130.41s]  I mean, she looks exactly like the pyro.
[130.41s -> 132.41s]  It's crazy.
[132.41s -> 134.41s]  How did the hell they get... Oh, okay.
[134.41s -> 136.41s]  Yeah, buddy.
[136.41s -> 138.41s]  Oh, what the heck.
[138.41s -> 140.41s]  My ping is too high.
[140.41s -> 142.41s]  It did kick me out.
[142.41s -> 144.41s]  Oh, it's made me be the tank.
[144.41s -> 146.41s]  Your ping is too high.
[146.41s -> 148.41s]  My ping is too high as well.
[148.41s -> 150.41s]  I told you.
[150.41s -> 152.41s]  I told you we just need to play against other people.
[154.41s -> 157.16s]  I was like, I was wrecking some bulls as a tank.
[157.16s -> 159.16s]  Dude, I got disconnected.
[159.16s -> 161.16s]  Your ping is too high.
[163.16s -> 165.72s]  Well, that works.
[165.72s -> 167.72s]  You know, we definitely should hang up by the docks.
[167.72s -> 169.72s]  Only because they can only really come from two real areas.
[169.72s -> 171.72s]  Like they come from straight.
[171.72s -> 173.72s]  They can't like climb. What are you doing?
[173.72s -> 175.72s]  I wanna go for a swim.
[175.72s -> 177.72s]  What are you doing, you idiot?
[177.72s -> 179.72s]  Well, okay, that answers that question.
[179.72s -> 181.72s]  The dock is not safe.
[181.72s -> 183.72s]  What did you do?
[183.72s -> 185.72s]  What did you do?
[185.72s -> 187.72s]  I thought he was gonna at least like grab on.
[189.72s -> 191.72s]  We will eventually have to jump down.
[191.72s -> 193.72s]  I will come to the rescue.
[193.72s -> 195.90s]  Of anyone who gets pulled off the roof.
[195.90s -> 198.65s]  Alright, let's do this thing.
[198.65s -> 200.65s]  Stay together to survive.
[200.65s -> 202.65s]  I immediately regret going on the roof.
[202.65s -> 204.65s]  There's a charger up here.
[204.65s -> 206.65s]  When can they climb?
[206.65s -> 208.65s]  Oh, I just fell. Awesome.
[208.65s -> 210.65s]  Spinner, watch out for the Spinner.
[210.65s -> 212.65s]  Oh my god, there's so many.
[212.65s -> 214.65s]  Oh, you're inside now. I'm coming for the rescue mission.
[214.65s -> 216.65s]  Good thing I didn't like edit my volume.
[216.65s -> 218.65s]  And me shooting the gun is louder than my thoughts.
[220.65s -> 222.65s]  Hobby Hamburger saved you.
[224.65s -> 226.65s]  Hamburger.
[226.65s -> 228.65s]  There's a lot of fire on the roof.
[228.65s -> 230.65s]  Yeah, I accidentally created all of them.
[230.65s -> 232.65s]  Why is the burger joint on fire?
[232.65s -> 234.89s]  Alright, try and regroup. Get back on top.
[234.89s -> 236.89s]  Regroup, get back on top.
[236.89s -> 238.89s]  Alright, is this a safe time to alt tab?
[238.89s -> 240.89s]  So I can talk to people?
[240.89s -> 242.89s]  There comes a tank.
[244.89s -> 246.89s]  Hunter down there too, Hunter.
[246.89s -> 248.89s]  Oh god, the tank does not like me at all.
[248.89s -> 250.89s]  Alright, sacrifice yourself and stand in the middle of the open
[250.89s -> 252.89s]  so we can shoot the tank.
[252.89s -> 254.89s]  Let me just do that right now.
[254.89s -> 256.89s]  Hunter on the roof.
[256.89s -> 259.90s]  Tank is jumping back down.
[259.90s -> 261.90s]  Watch yourself, Boo.
[261.90s -> 263.90s]  Where are you?
[263.90s -> 265.90s]  The tank is made of bricks.
[265.90s -> 267.90s]  Oh, just keep running in circles.
[267.90s -> 269.90s]  It's not fire.
[269.90s -> 271.90s]  Yeah, I have two health.
[271.90s -> 273.90s]  Tank down, tank down.
[273.90s -> 277.99s]  Charger on me.
[277.99s -> 280.68s]  Protect us.
[280.68s -> 282.68s]  I am protecting the healer.
[282.68s -> 284.68s]  Alright, let's get back.
[284.68s -> 286.68s]  Take those pills and get back on the roof.
[286.68s -> 288.68s]  Secret ladder.
[288.68s -> 291.50s]  Wish I saw that earlier.
[291.50s -> 293.50s]  Are we all up here?
[293.50s -> 295.50s]  Yeah. We are now.
[295.50s -> 298.76s]  Nice.
[298.76s -> 300.76s]  I am going to heal up.
[300.76s -> 302.76s]  Yeah, heal up. We will protect you.
[302.76s -> 304.76s]  Hey, where do we get that ammunition stuff?
[304.76s -> 306.76s]  Down there.
[306.76s -> 308.76s]  Yeah, ammo is downstairs I think.
[308.76s -> 310.76s]  Okay, let me just go down there.
[310.76s -> 313.26s]  Yeah, thanks.
[313.26s -> 315.26s]  So far so good, so far so good.
[315.26s -> 317.26s]  We are alright here.
[317.26s -> 319.26s]  Halfway, towards like any sort of credibility.
[319.26s -> 321.26s]  Yeah, tank down there.
[321.26s -> 323.26s]  Tank coming up front, tank coming up front right now.
[323.26s -> 325.69s]  Oh, I am getting stuck.
[325.69s -> 328.57s]  Oh, I am on fire now.
[328.57s -> 330.57s]  There is a lot of fire.
[330.57s -> 332.57s]  Tank is up here.
[332.57s -> 334.57s]  Oh, he just clubbed me.
[334.57s -> 336.57s]  I just fell down.
[336.57s -> 338.57s]  Uh oh.
[338.57s -> 341.51s]  I am down the back side.
[341.51s -> 343.51s]  I need ammo, I need ammo so bad.
[343.51s -> 346.20s]  Oh, my tank.
[346.20s -> 348.20s]  No, give me the ammo.
[348.20s -> 350.20s]  Get the hell away from me.
[350.20s -> 352.20s]  You bastards, you rat bastards.
[352.20s -> 354.20s]  I am getting smoked, he is on the roof.
[354.20s -> 356.20s]  Thank you, nice.
[356.20s -> 358.20s]  Oh, 110 shock, oh my god.
[358.20s -> 360.20s]  No.
[360.20s -> 362.20s]  I will not die in vain.
[362.20s -> 365.14s]  I tried, Jerma.
[365.14s -> 367.14s]  There is a tank near you.
[367.14s -> 369.14s]  I am resisting.
[369.14s -> 371.90s]  I am alive, I am still alive.
[371.90s -> 373.90s]  Oh, you are in the spit.
[373.90s -> 375.90s]  I am going to throw the pipe bomb.
[375.90s -> 378.65s]  I am still, this is unbelievable.
[378.65s -> 380.65s]  I can't believe I am still alive.
[380.65s -> 382.65s]  Oh, there is a tank on the fence right there.
[382.65s -> 384.65s]  He is right behind me.
[384.65s -> 386.65s]  Wait, the tank was behind me?
[386.65s -> 388.65s]  The tank was behind me?
[388.65s -> 390.65s]  Thanks, bro.
[390.65s -> 392.65s]  Alright, let's get on the roof and evade all the zombies.
[392.65s -> 394.65s]  There is a ladder around here.
[394.65s -> 396.65s]  Hey, you guys got 40 seconds and we got the bronze standard.
[396.65s -> 398.65s]  I got hit by the tank.
[398.65s -> 400.65s]  And his rocks.
[400.65s -> 402.65s]  It is alright.
[402.65s -> 407.27s]  Did we both just throw a pipe bomb at the same exact time?
[407.27s -> 409.27s]  Well, it is double the amount of distraction.
[409.27s -> 411.27s]  I think I threw a pipe bomb.
[411.27s -> 413.27s]  Also, there is a big mean tank.
[413.27s -> 415.27s]  Oh, and a charger on me.
[415.27s -> 417.27s]  There is two tanks and a charger next to me.
[417.27s -> 419.27s]  20 seconds, 20 seconds, you can do it.
[419.27s -> 421.27s]  Oh god, not towards the water.
[421.27s -> 423.27s]  Run in as many circles as you can.
[423.27s -> 425.27s]  Approximately 10 seconds of circles.
[425.27s -> 427.58s]  Oh god, invisible wall.
[427.58s -> 429.94s]  No!
[429.94s -> 431.94s]  5 seconds!
[431.94s -> 433.94s]  5 seconds!
[439.94s -> 441.94s]  At least we tried.
[441.94s -> 443.94s]  That's unfortunate.
[443.94s -> 445.94s]  I should have taken a spill or a swim.
[445.94s -> 447.94s]  Yeah, I should have just ran towards the water and teased him.
