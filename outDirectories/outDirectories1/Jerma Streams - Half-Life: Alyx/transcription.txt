[0.70s -> 8.88s]  Yeah, Half-Life Alex. Half-Life Alex. I've been waiting about a year, waiting a while to play Half-Life Alex.
[8.88s -> 17.83s]  I told you, everybody thought I was gonna take a day off today. No, I'm here. After yesterday, I was a little tight, yes.
[17.83s -> 25.80s]  But I'm not taking a day off. I got VR to play. Though in an hour and ten minutes when this stream has to turn off,
[25.80s -> 29.42s]  we can both be right. How does that sound?
[35.21s -> 43.22s]  How you guys doing? Hope you're doing well. How drunk is he?
[44.26s -> 50.33s]  Ugh. On a scale of one to ten? Maybe like, like seven?
[52.30s -> 62.97s]  Yeah, it's like, it's like two fifteen, guys. I'm obviously a seven right now. No, I'm drunk. I've got a coffee in my hands.
[68.01s -> 77.32s]  You're always a seven. Don't play the, don't play Alex on the Vive. Well, this is, what, I'm sorry.
[79.24s -> 82.92s]  I'm the sorry bastard that got the Wii
[84.10s -> 92.07s]  and have to play the shitty version of the AAA games. They're called Call of Duty 3 on the Xbox.
[93.30s -> 100.57s]  Call of Duty 3 on the Wii was like an N64 game. I have the Wii version of all these AAA games.
[105.96s -> 112.30s]  Or they just make a party game. And they do, oh, Assassin's Creed for the Xbox 360.
[113.10s -> 119.18s]  Hi, 1080p graphics. And then they make the one for the Wii. Assassin's Creed, where's the party?
[120.18s -> 132.95s]  And there's bowling. I, I had to play that one. And they all have like big heads.
[134.81s -> 137.77s]  They all, they all got like big avat, like Wii avatar heads.
[138.81s -> 146.95s]  But me, sorry, me, sorry. Please play Assassin's Creed Wii bowling.
[151.67s -> 161.29s]  Oh, big head tennis. Don't make fun of my weird mannerisms. I'm aware of them.
[164.04s -> 170.60s]  Remember, anytime I'm about to say something, I say, oh, oh, and, and, oh, oh, I know that.
[170.60s -> 177.83s]  Like it's been made, people have told me that a thousand times. I know. Oh, oh, it even bleeds
[177.83s -> 187.91s]  into other characters. Dick Bugleberry. It's just like, oh, and, oh, oh, I can't help it.
[189.30s -> 194.44s]  I just, it's, it's a filler word. When are you going to play Chubby Bunny? I'm not playing
[194.44s -> 199.16s]  Chubby Bunny right now. I'm doing Half-Life Alex, the most anticipated virtual game
[199.88s -> 205.77s]  since the second one came out. Now, a lot of people were like hyped up for this game.
[206.41s -> 211.16s]  I kind of wasn't. So I'm going in with completely just basic expectations.
[216.71s -> 224.12s]  I'm really not hyped up about this at all. So I'm not a liar. I swear to God. I, I, I,
[224.12s -> 227.96s]  I have to be completely honest with you guys. I kind of don't even care that I'm playing this
[227.96s -> 234.73s]  right now. I've made sure to not give a shit because I want to be either blown away or not.
[234.73s -> 238.81s]  Like, I don't want it to, I got to have my expectations. Like, I don't care, right? I've
[238.81s -> 243.14s]  been telling myself, no, you don't fucking care. Who cares? It's a dumb game. Who cares?
[248.07s -> 254.07s]  You're going to get blown to hell. Get the other controllers. I got the Wii controllers,
[254.07s -> 259.26s]  all right? What's wrong with you? What do you mean what's wrong? What's wrong with you?
[259.26s -> 266.86s]  Why are you saying that? Here we are. And just in case you didn't know,
[267.74s -> 278.14s]  just in case you didn't know, I'm on Twitch. Do you ever think, I've, no, I've already talked
[278.14s -> 282.46s]  about this. I already went over, like, if the doctor went to the drive-through with his doctor's
[282.46s -> 287.43s]  coat on. Like, I don't like to wear this shit anywhere besides, like, in front of the camera
[287.43s -> 296.18s]  here. Because people see the shirt and they go, you Twitch? Twitch, huh? And I'm just like, oh,
[296.18s -> 307.00s]  yeah, I'm a fan. I don't even, I like, I stole this. I stole this shirt. It's like, if a doctor
[307.00s -> 311.88s]  goes to like a drive-through at Dunkin' Donuts and he wears his lab coat, they're going to be like,
[312.44s -> 322.15s]  you're a doctor? Yeah, yeah, fuck, I forgot I had this on. No, no, I'm an engineer. I don't do that.
[322.79s -> 331.85s]  Somebody said nice bulge. Oh, that's funny. That you can literally not see below my waist right now.
[333.05s -> 344.79s]  And that guy for 20 minutes. Like, you mean this? Is that what you mean? Is that the thing
[344.79s -> 354.14s]  you're describing? Because, I mean, that's there. That's what we mean. Right, okay. He's got a dad
[354.14s -> 365.85s]  bod? I'm not 20. I'm not even 25. I'm not even 30. I look good for 35, okay? You can see the outline
[365.85s -> 374.07s]  of my breasticles. Don't you know that means that's a good thing for a 35-year-old? I can do this.
[374.71s -> 385.94s]  And I can do this. That actually kind of hurt. I know I shouldn't do that. You know, if you tell
[385.94s -> 389.14s]  yourself that you look good in the mirror over and over again at some point, hey, guess what?
[389.14s -> 392.26s]  What's that? Oh, wow, that's the wart finger. No, it's not. It's covered up today. Sorry about that,
[392.26s -> 399.77s]  guys. No wart jokes today. All right, I'm ready. No more stalling. Wait, one more, one more sip
[399.77s -> 420.09s]  of coffee. I don't want the thing to fly off. Oh, let me put it down on my coaster.
[420.81s -> 436.55s]  I like the bedroom of like an 11-year-old boy. You guys ready for Half-Life Alex or should I
[436.55s -> 448.63s]  continue? I'm going in. Close to going. Am I gonna get this shit good? Look, you get to stall
[449.35s -> 455.16s]  on a game like this. This is the plan for today. I'm not changing games. Like, I'm playing Half-Life
[455.16s -> 459.72s]  Alex until I can't breathe anymore, which would probably be in about an hour, two hours, three,
[459.72s -> 483.13s]  I don't know, maybe four. You're a doomer. How would I be a doomer? Ready. God, it's been so
[483.13s -> 490.10s]  long since I've gone into the world of Half-Life. I forgot the whole story because it was seriously
[490.10s -> 500.92s]  like fucking 15 years ago. I can't wait to not even know fucking basic characters' names. Why is this
[500.92s -> 510.01s]  so tight? This hurts. Ow. This fucking hurts. I think I broke it from last night. I didn't even
[510.01s -> 526.28s]  care. Okay, I'm ready. You guys ready? Here we are. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Didn't I fuck with this
[526.28s -> 535.51s]  last night? 64, right? Show the settings. I'll show the settings in a second. Hold on. I can't
[535.51s -> 546.76s]  even hear myself talk. Okay. Not quit. Show the settings. Sure. Okay. You wanna see? There. There
[546.76s -> 554.15s]  you go. There you go. Okay. Yeah, it's on low. I got a 1080. I can't even put that on medium,
[554.15s -> 570.90s]  I don't think. Here we go. Difficulty normal. Challenging combat. Very challenging. Easy. Wait,
[570.90s -> 580.17s]  there's a mode below easy? There's a story mode? Do you even play the game or do you just sit and
[580.17s -> 585.45s]  watch? That's actually kind of cool. All right, I'm doing normal. No, we're not doing hard.
[586.09s -> 591.80s]  That's not happening. Movement. Blink. Teleport to destinations with fast linear movement.
[593.72s -> 600.36s]  Move continuously based on your head orientation. Move continuously based on your hand orientation
[600.36s -> 619.38s]  or blink. It's no audio. What the fuck? Oh, sorry. Where the fuck is the mouse? There you go. Got it.
[620.02s -> 631.48s]  Okay, good. Wait, which one of these is better? Blink with head orientation. Is that the best one?
[632.12s -> 650.23s]  Blink sucks. Continuous hand. Continuous hand. Can I change this? Continuous head.
[651.11s -> 664.41s]  Can I stop moving? Continuous head. Okay. Aim slot. S.O. 50. All right. Quiet. Here comes the
[664.41s -> 694.47s]  cutscene. Gotta go. Hello. That was not a good intro. Right. Do I get visited? Do I get visited
[694.47s -> 700.31s]  by a Gorgonaut? It's five years before the collapse of the Citadel and the death of Eli Vance.
[701.69s -> 710.22s]  Oh yeah. Object. Alex Vance. Age 19. Female. Affiliation. Human resistance. Current assignment.
[711.56s -> 719.37s]  A connoissance. Why are you here? This is like the third game they've made. Why? What are you
[719.37s -> 727.21s]  doing here? You don't jump. You don't watch like fucking Return of the Jedi first and then go,
[727.21s -> 741.98s]  wait, hold on. Darth Vader is just dead? Holy shit. Okay, low fidelity graphics. My ass. This
[741.98s -> 769.42s]  looks fantastic. What station does it have to be on? Push to move. Push. Whoa. Push snap. Turn left or
[769.42s -> 787.94s]  right? Oh, that's okay. Pretty good fidelity, I think. You hit somebody. All of a sudden you
[787.94s -> 817.06s]  hear like. What's saying? Why am I acting like a caveman? That was just handed this. Who was this?
[817.62s -> 838.33s]  Oh, this make me angry. Oh, dude, sick. You got a fucking GTX 3090. What do I have to do?
[838.97s -> 860.39s]  What do I do? Crush the can. Oh, you can't. Isn't there like a fucking alien invasion?
[861.35s -> 887.16s]  Oh, incoming call. How do I turn on device? Oh, I hate that already. Metricot movement is normal.
[887.16s -> 890.20s]  Same for the combine patrols. How's it going in the stockyard?
[891.82s -> 897.74s]  One combine. Oh, I don't like that subtitle. They're never going to miss it. Here, see for yourself.
[900.84s -> 906.68s]  Someone's taken the combine construction network. Don't get greedy guys. We're not made of time here.
[906.68s -> 913.16s]  One minute and I'm out. Guaranteed. Oh, also I spotted the combine supplies into the quarantine
[913.16s -> 922.25s]  zone. That place has been deserted for years. That is all. Well, we'll look into it. Oh,
[922.25s -> 928.25s]  let's pay attention. Eat back at the safe house baby. Eat back at the safe house. What is it,
[928.25s -> 938.46s]  Russell? Is the game blinking? Is my character blinking? I keep seeing like a little like black
[938.46s -> 945.91s]  flash. Like flash. Like I'm blinking. And no, no, no, no, no. It's not me blinking in the headset.
[945.91s -> 959.29s]  Right? That's me. No, it's not. I'm telling you. All right. Let's go. Of course, you can.
[959.93s -> 984.38s]  What is he drawing? Me. Me. Me. Son. Explode. Wait, what's this? B 456 B pilon seven B.
[985.10s -> 996.92s]  I don't know. Do I need that information? I don't know. All right. Let's go meet in the safe house.
[996.92s -> 1011.90s]  I'm telling you, the shit's blanking.
[1011.90s -> 1016.37s]  How do I get out of here?
[1016.37s -> 1017.45s]  Enable spectator mode.
[1017.45s -> 1026.98s]  It's too jerky.
[1026.98s -> 1027.98s]  Enable spectator.
[1027.98s -> 1028.98s]  I think it's already on.
[1028.98s -> 1030.80s]  Medium?
[1030.80s -> 1031.80s]  Turn on spectator.
[1031.80s -> 1034.21s]  Yeah, it's already on.
[1034.21s -> 1038.10s]  What button do I press?
[1038.10s -> 1041.10s]  Capture the game window.
[1041.10s -> 1042.10s]  Capture the game window.
[1042.10s -> 1043.10s]  Capture the game.
[1043.10s -> 1045.28s]  Isn't that what I'm doing?
[1045.28s -> 1046.96s]  We're capturing the wrong thing.
[1046.96s -> 1050.22s]  Capture game window.
[1050.22s -> 1051.22s]  Wait a minute.
[1051.22s -> 1054.64s]  I'm coming out.
[1054.68s -> 1056.24s]  I'm capping the VR view.
[1056.24s -> 1059.55s]  Should I not be doing that?
[1059.55s -> 1072.83s]  Capture the actual game engine.
[1072.83s -> 1074.99s]  Spectator mode shows us your ammo and shit.
[1074.99s -> 1076.68s]  Oh.
[1076.68s -> 1080.16s]  Wait a minute.
[1080.16s -> 1081.16s]  Turn off the subtitles.
[1081.16s -> 1082.16s]  Wait, hold on.
[1082.16s -> 1084.08s]  This is like a lot to take in right now.
[1084.08s -> 1086.00s]  I'm doing the steam mirror thing.
[1086.00s -> 1087.80s]  So I just cap the actual game?
[1087.80s -> 1109.21s]  Like that.
[1109.21s -> 1112.97s]  So this is like the actual game being captured, not the VR window.
[1112.97s -> 1123.79s]  Okay.
[1123.79s -> 1127.42s]  The game is now being captured.
[1127.50s -> 1131.02s]  How do you actually get into the settings of the game?
[1131.02s -> 1132.02s]  What's the pause menu?
[1132.02s -> 1139.14s]  Left grip?
[1139.14s -> 1145.50s]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[1145.50s -> 1146.50s]  All right, let's go.
[1146.50s -> 1148.94s]  All right, now help me out here.
[1148.94s -> 1149.94s]  Options menu.
[1149.94s -> 1154.00s]  Spectator.
[1154.00s -> 1156.00s]  Yeah, spectator camera.
[1156.00s -> 1157.00s]  Okay.
[1157.00s -> 1158.00s]  Spectator HUD.
[1158.00s -> 1159.00s]  Medium.
[1159.00s -> 1161.84s]  Spectator smoothing low.
[1161.84s -> 1162.84s]  Spectator medium.
[1162.84s -> 1166.70s]  On high.
[1166.70s -> 1167.70s]  Is that going to work?
[1167.70s -> 1172.61s]  Can my computer do this?
[1172.61s -> 1174.61s]  And turn off the subtitles.
[1174.61s -> 1175.61s]  Is that good?
[1175.61s -> 1186.06s]  All right.
[1186.10s -> 1189.10s]  Subtitles for spectator only.
[1189.10s -> 1191.92s]  Subtitles in closed captions.
[1191.92s -> 1195.70s]  Subtitles for spectator.
[1195.70s -> 1201.01s]  Subtitles on.
[1201.01s -> 1204.63s]  Subtitles spectator window only.
[1204.63s -> 1206.00s]  Okay.
[1206.00s -> 1207.00s]  Okay.
[1207.00s -> 1209.58s]  I didn't...
[1209.58s -> 1215.08s]  Well, there are a lot of settings in this fucking game.
[1215.08s -> 1217.79s]  I gotta check these cables.
[1217.79s -> 1219.79s]  Why am I getting a black light?
[1219.79s -> 1220.79s]  Everything's good.
[1220.79s -> 1230.58s]  Oh, because I dropped the headset on the ground last night.
[1230.58s -> 1231.58s]  What am I stupid?
[1231.62s -> 1232.62s]  All right, I'm ready.
[1232.62s -> 1235.14s]  Let's go.
[1235.14s -> 1238.75s]  It's playable.
[1238.75s -> 1241.50s]  All right, let's get out of here.
[1241.50s -> 1246.97s]  Is that better?
[1246.97s -> 1251.60s]  Out of the door.
[1251.60s -> 1254.31s]  Much better?
[1254.31s -> 1255.31s]  Okay.
[1255.31s -> 1256.62s]  Well, I didn't...
[1256.62s -> 1259.62s]  Every VR game I've ever played was just like plug it in and turn it on.
[1259.62s -> 1261.62s]  I didn't know there was like all these settings.
[1261.62s -> 1262.62s]  All right, let's go.
[1262.62s -> 1277.64s]  You can't see the chat?
[1277.64s -> 1281.64s]  Oh, the fucking chat is now not viewable.
[1281.64s -> 1288.14s]  Okay, well, we'll deal with that later.
[1288.14s -> 1293.78s]  Oh, toggle game mode.
[1293.78s -> 1296.36s]  Right.
[1296.40s -> 1299.28s]  I would have said to walk down the stairs.
[1299.28s -> 1300.28s]  Okay, here we go.
[1300.28s -> 1302.42s]  Hey, it doesn't even matter.
[1302.42s -> 1303.42s]  Like, you guys...
[1303.42s -> 1304.42s]  What do you mean?
[1304.42s -> 1305.42s]  You guys can see the chat.
[1305.42s -> 1306.42s]  I just...
[1306.42s -> 1307.42s]  You guys are...
[1307.42s -> 1308.42s]  You guys are there.
[1308.42s -> 1317.31s]  Because every time I go like this, you just know that I'm looking at you.
[1317.31s -> 1324.40s]  All right, let's move.
[1324.40s -> 1335.75s]  Do my part!
[1335.75s -> 1345.67s]  All right, I'm going back in.
[1345.67s -> 1348.49s]  Well, that was fucking crazy.
[1348.49s -> 1353.80s]  I need the full audio experience.
[1353.80s -> 1354.80s]  Oh.
[1354.80s -> 1367.78s]  Oh, there's an alien in there.
[1367.78s -> 1370.42s]  Let him out?
[1370.42s -> 1374.01s]  Oh, let the alien out.
[1374.05s -> 1375.05s]  What are we looking at?
[1375.05s -> 1384.22s]  Are we filming this?
[1384.22s -> 1385.72s]  Feed him.
[1385.72s -> 1390.29s]  Feed the baby.
[1390.29s -> 1391.29s]  Feed the baby.
[1391.29s -> 1392.29s]  Feed him with what?
[1392.29s -> 1393.29s]  This?
[1393.29s -> 1402.96s]  Oh!
[1402.96s -> 1403.96s]  I don't overfeed the fish.
[1403.96s -> 1404.96s]  Don't overfeed...
[1404.96s -> 1406.96s]  Some people just sit there and they just dump.
[1406.96s -> 1408.96s]  Over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[1408.96s -> 1413.85s]  Fuck it.
[1413.85s -> 1414.85s]  My stream is on.
[1414.85s -> 1419.52s]  Why is my video feed...
[1419.52s -> 1420.52s]  I just caught that.
[1420.52s -> 1421.52s]  Barely.
[1421.52s -> 1428.19s]  Right there, I saw, like, my stream playing.
[1428.19s -> 1430.01s]  All right, let's go.
[1430.01s -> 1433.49s]  Oh, shit.
[1433.49s -> 1434.49s]  I think it just hit you.
[1434.49s -> 1436.30s]  See?
[1436.30s -> 1442.98s]  Can I pull this down?
[1443.02s -> 1444.02s]  All right, whatever.
[1444.02s -> 1452.41s]  It wants me to aim it right there.
[1452.41s -> 1453.41s]  Is he standing there?
[1453.41s -> 1460.64s]  I think there's a person standing there.
[1460.64s -> 1462.39s]  Let me in!
[1462.39s -> 1478.99s]  He's got, like, a little finger.
[1478.99s -> 1479.99s]  All right, let's move.
[1479.99s -> 1482.74s]  Wait, wait, wait, where are we going?
[1482.74s -> 1484.18s]  Uh, I don't know.
[1484.18s -> 1485.18s]  This one?
[1485.18s -> 1486.18s]  This one.
[1486.18s -> 1487.18s]  This one.
[1487.18s -> 1488.42s]  That one.
[1488.42s -> 1489.42s]  The only one that works.
[1489.42s -> 1490.42s]  What?
[1490.42s -> 1499.59s]  Nobody can do more wire but him.
[1499.59s -> 1500.59s]  Alex!
[1500.59s -> 1501.59s]  Hey!
[1501.59s -> 1505.31s]  Are we good?
[1505.31s -> 1506.31s]  Yep, they got the reactor.
[1506.31s -> 1507.31s]  Easy peasy.
[1507.35s -> 1510.35s]  I'm headed back to the safe house right now to meet Dad.
[1510.35s -> 1512.35s]  The dinosaur DNA is in here.
[1512.35s -> 1513.35s]  Stay safe.
[1513.35s -> 1514.35s]  Hey!
[1514.35s -> 1515.35s]  Whoa!
[1515.35s -> 1516.35s]  Ow!
[1516.35s -> 1531.54s]  My hand!
[1531.54s -> 1534.70s]  Too much strength.
[1534.70s -> 1535.70s]  Too much strength.
[1535.70s -> 1541.74s]  What's in here?
[1541.74s -> 1542.74s]  Documents.
[1542.74s -> 1543.74s]  All right, go.
[1543.74s -> 1545.82s]  We're under attack.
[1545.82s -> 1546.82s]  I have to, like, move my butt.
[1546.82s -> 1547.82s]  Alex, over here.
[1547.82s -> 1550.21s]  Hey!
[1550.21s -> 1551.21s]  What is it?
[1551.21s -> 1560.70s]  This doesn't seem like a routine sweep.
[1560.70s -> 1562.01s]  Are you sure?
[1562.01s -> 1569.33s]  I don't know.
[1569.37s -> 1570.37s]  I have to, like, move my butt.
[1570.37s -> 1571.37s]  Alex, over here.
[1571.37s -> 1572.37s]  Hey!
[1572.37s -> 1573.37s]  What is it?
[1573.37s -> 1574.37s]  This doesn't seem like a routine sweep.
[1574.37s -> 1575.37s]  Are you sure everything went okay?
[1575.37s -> 1576.37s]  100 percent.
[1576.37s -> 1577.37s]  Okay, let's do a funny thing.
[1577.37s -> 1578.37s]  Get a camera.
[1578.37s -> 1579.37s]  I'll be like, hey, let me out of here.
[1579.37s -> 1580.37s]  Yoo-hoo!
[1580.37s -> 1583.27s]  Oh, yeah!
[1583.27s -> 1585.34s]  Here we go.
[1585.34s -> 1586.34s]  Didn't work.
[1586.34s -> 1587.34s]  Didn't work.
[1587.34s -> 1599.02s]  Didn't work.
[1599.02s -> 1607.23s]  Didn't work.
[1607.23s -> 1608.23s]  How do I run?
[1608.23s -> 1609.23s]  How do you run?
[1609.23s -> 1610.23s]  He's so slow.
[1610.23s -> 1613.84s]  What?
[1613.84s -> 1614.84s]  There we go.
[1614.84s -> 1615.84s]  Oh, my God.
[1615.88s -> 1622.24s]  I didn't see him.
[1622.24s -> 1623.99s]  Oh, shit.
[1623.99s -> 1624.99s]  Cargo.
[1624.99s -> 1625.99s]  Oh.
[1625.99s -> 1631.97s]  In there?
[1631.97s -> 1632.97s]  Door.
[1632.97s -> 1633.97s]  Store.
[1633.97s -> 1634.97s]  What?
[1634.97s -> 1635.97s]  Door.
[1635.97s -> 1636.97s]  Hey!
[1636.97s -> 1637.97s]  Hey!
[1637.97s -> 1647.27s]  I won't!
[1647.27s -> 1656.00s]  No, no, no, no, no!
[1656.00s -> 1657.00s]  I just...
[1657.00s -> 1662.14s]  Ow!
[1662.14s -> 1669.02s]  Come on!
[1669.02s -> 1677.17s]  Fred.
[1677.17s -> 1678.17s]  Eat this?
[1678.17s -> 1681.17s]  Hey, I feel like something just popped up on my HUD.
[1681.17s -> 1682.17s]  What?
[1682.17s -> 1683.17s]  Oh, I eat cookies.
[1683.17s -> 1684.17s]  Oh, yeah.
[1684.17s -> 1693.15s]  Oh, yeah.
[1693.15s -> 1696.38s]  Oh, yeah.
[1696.38s -> 1699.66s]  Oh, yeah.
[1699.66s -> 1700.66s]  Oh, yeah.
[1700.66s -> 1701.66s]  Oh, yeah.
[1701.70s -> 1702.70s]  Oh, I eat cookies.
[1702.70s -> 1703.70s]  Thumbs up.
[1703.70s -> 1704.70s]  I ate it.
[1704.70s -> 1717.00s]  This is fucking...
[1717.00s -> 1721.78s]  OK, I'm going to fall.
[1721.78s -> 1738.83s]  And that's, ladies and gentlemen, what it would look like if bugs ruled the world.
[1738.83s -> 1743.83s]  If bugs were even 20% larger than they are now, that's the kind of shit we'd be dealing
[1743.83s -> 1744.83s]  with.
[1744.83s -> 1753.58s]  I would never leave my house, ever.
[1753.58s -> 1772.99s]  Should I bring this with me?
[1772.99s -> 1773.99s]  I need it.
[1773.99s -> 1787.01s]  All right.
[1787.01s -> 1788.01s]  It's just like Hitman.
[1788.01s -> 1789.82s]  It's just like fucking Hitman.
[1789.86s -> 1792.86s]  I got, like, my guns in here, and they're going to pat me down.
[1792.86s -> 1807.24s]  I just got a delivery!
[1807.24s -> 1808.24s]  I just got a delivery!
[1808.24s -> 1809.24s]  I just live here!
[1809.24s -> 1810.24s]  Shoot!
[1810.24s -> 1817.42s]  Pat me down.
[1817.42s -> 1820.42s]  I got a delivery for the mafia boss!
[1820.42s -> 1827.14s]  I didn't steal anything.
[1827.14s -> 1830.14s]  This just flowers for fuck's sake!
[1830.14s -> 1831.14s]  No one!
[1831.14s -> 1832.14s]  I didn't see anyone!
[1832.14s -> 1833.14s]  Quick, run!
[1833.14s -> 1834.14s]  Dear.
[1834.14s -> 1854.38s]  Nice posture.
[1854.38s -> 1857.10s]  Shut up.
[1857.10s -> 1860.10s]  Give me a break.
[1860.14s -> 1861.14s]  Give me a break.
[1861.14s -> 1864.14s]  I got, like, a 12-pound thing on my head.
[1864.14s -> 1871.05s]  Where are you taking me?
[1871.05s -> 1872.05s]  This posture.
[1872.05s -> 1873.05s]  Where's my father?
[1873.05s -> 1875.31s]  Hello?
[1875.31s -> 1878.15s]  Damn it!
[1878.15s -> 1879.15s]  Where's my father?
[1879.15s -> 1882.61s]  Just stop moving around.
[1882.61s -> 1884.62s]  Asshole.
[1891.53s -> 1893.02s]  It's Wheatley!
[1893.02s -> 1896.02s]  Wheatley's coming to save us!
[1896.02s -> 1901.42s]  Sticks in his...
[1901.42s -> 1902.42s]  Sorry!
[1902.42s -> 1903.42s]  Sorry!
[1903.42s -> 1904.42s]  I didn't mean to...
[1904.42s -> 1905.79s]  Sorry!
[1905.79s -> 1919.45s]  Sorry!
[1919.45s -> 1920.45s]  Alex, run!
[1920.49s -> 1921.49s]  If you see something here, just be...
[1921.49s -> 1922.49s]  I'm sorry!
[1922.49s -> 1926.03s]  Nice.
[1926.03s -> 1929.03s]  PlayStation 2 gamer headset.
[1929.03s -> 1935.26s]  Russell?
[1935.26s -> 1936.26s]  I told you.
[1936.26s -> 1937.26s]  I've been in an accident.
[1937.26s -> 1938.26s]  I know!
[1938.26s -> 1939.26s]  I caused it.
[1939.26s -> 1940.26s]  So, technically, not an accident.
[1940.26s -> 1941.26s]  You've got to get moving.
[1941.26s -> 1942.26s]  Wait.
[1942.26s -> 1943.26s]  Wait.
[1943.26s -> 1944.26s]  Where's Dad?
[1944.26s -> 1945.26s]  He's fine.
[1945.26s -> 1946.26s]  Follow the drone.
[1946.26s -> 1953.71s]  It's Wheatley.
[1953.71s -> 1956.72s]  All right, let's go.
[1956.72s -> 1958.90s]  So, Dad's okay, right?
[1958.90s -> 1959.90s]  Yeah.
[1959.90s -> 1960.90s]  Well, no.
[1960.90s -> 1961.90s]  To be honest, he's in huge trouble.
[1961.90s -> 1962.90s]  But...
[1962.94s -> 1963.94s]  I still...
[1963.94s -> 1964.94s]  I can't help it.
[1964.94s -> 1965.94s]  I have to help him.
[1965.94s -> 1966.94s]  I need to have something in my hands.
[1966.94s -> 1967.94s]  I'm one of those weirdos.
[1967.94s -> 1968.94s]  I had no way of knowing who was in the window.
[1968.94s -> 1970.94s]  If I don't have something in my hand, I can't function.
[1970.94s -> 1971.94s]  Yes.
[1971.94s -> 1972.94s]  The result was that I saved you.
[1972.94s -> 1973.94s]  Do we know where they're taking him?
[1973.94s -> 1974.94s]  Criminal holding.
[1974.94s -> 1977.94s]  And then, when they realized he was Eli Vance,
[1977.94s -> 1981.74s]  they want to plan to get him back.
[1981.74s -> 1982.74s]  Hey.
[1982.74s -> 1983.74s]  You're close to my lab.
[1983.74s -> 1984.74s]  Keep following the drone.
[1984.74s -> 1985.74s]  What's true?
[1985.74s -> 1988.74s]  Bring up the jump indicator and release to jump.
[1988.74s -> 1991.74s]  Russell, what did you guys find back there?
[1991.74s -> 1992.74s]  Well, that's the crazy thing.
[1992.74s -> 1993.74s]  I don't know.
[1993.74s -> 1994.74s]  Just...
[1994.78s -> 1997.78s]  Just very picturesque building.
[1997.78s -> 1998.78s]  Citadel?
[1998.78s -> 1999.78s]  Something else.
[1999.78s -> 2000.78s]  And whatever it is...
[2000.78s -> 2007.01s]  Okay.
[2007.01s -> 2008.01s]  Jump indicator.
[2008.01s -> 2010.01s]  Russell, just hang on.
[2010.01s -> 2011.01s]  I'm almost there.
[2012.01s -> 2022.02s]  When do I get a gun?
[2022.02s -> 2029.25s]  Force push!
[2029.25s -> 2043.74s]  Minus two.
[2043.74s -> 2046.13s]  Come on.
[2047.13s -> 2048.13s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2048.13s -> 2049.13s]  Can we get to play?
[2049.13s -> 2050.13s]  Can I play this with him?
[2051.13s -> 2053.13s]  Please tell me I can play this with him.
[2053.13s -> 2055.01s]  All right.
[2055.01s -> 2056.01s]  It's me versus you, chat.
[2056.01s -> 2057.01s]  Ready?
[2057.01s -> 2062.90s]  I'm X's UROs, okay?
[2062.94s -> 2065.20s]  Guess what?
[2065.20s -> 2067.21s]  It'll...
[2067.21s -> 2074.34s]  Okay.
[2074.34s -> 2075.34s]  I'm over it.
[2075.34s -> 2077.98s]  Wait, can I?
[2077.98s -> 2087.42s]  Ow!
[2087.42s -> 2094.52s]  And here's the best feature of the game.
[2094.52s -> 2100.88s]  Hey!
[2107.79s -> 2108.79s]  Ah!
[2109.79s -> 2113.53s]  He's dead!
[2123.83s -> 2124.83s]  He didn't see us.
[2124.83s -> 2126.14s]  Oh, no.
[2126.14s -> 2127.14s]  It's the last...
[2127.14s -> 2131.14s]  It's the last remnant of Wheatley's chat piece.
[2132.14s -> 2145.09s]  What did that say?
[2145.09s -> 2147.03s]  I need that tutorial.
[2148.03s -> 2150.03s]  To mantle, push, and hold while moving.
[2151.03s -> 2158.74s]  Hello?
[2158.74s -> 2169.87s]  Hello, hello, hello?
[2170.87s -> 2171.87s]  Whoa, stop.
[2174.01s -> 2175.01s]  There was a phone on there.
[2176.95s -> 2180.37s]  It's too heavy.
[2181.37s -> 2183.37s]  Holy shit, this is like 50 pounds.
[2191.71s -> 2194.74s]  Secret entrance.
[2194.74s -> 2195.74s]  Okay, let's wait.
[2198.20s -> 2199.20s]  Nope, it exploded.
[2199.20s -> 2200.20s]  I'm fine, by the way.
[2201.20s -> 2202.44s]  Right.
[2202.44s -> 2203.44s]  Let me get the tea.
[2205.38s -> 2206.38s]  Okay.
[2208.75s -> 2210.75s]  I promise I'm your grandmother.
[2211.75s -> 2213.12s]  Russell.
[2213.16s -> 2214.40s]  They've got Dad.
[2215.40s -> 2216.58s]  I know.
[2216.58s -> 2217.58s]  This...
[2217.58s -> 2218.58s]  This is bad.
[2218.58s -> 2222.58s]  They're gonna find out what he knows and then, yeah, they're gonna kill him.
[2222.58s -> 2224.84s]  Oh, God.
[2224.84s -> 2227.84s]  But, the good news is, we've got something they don't.
[2227.84s -> 2228.84s]  Which is?
[2229.84s -> 2230.84s]  My plan to get him back.
[2230.84s -> 2231.84s]  Great.
[2231.84s -> 2232.84s]  Let's hear it.
[2232.84s -> 2235.84s]  Now, pretty soon they're gonna realize that your Dad is not gonna talk.
[2235.84s -> 2237.84s]  And when that happens, he's off to have his brain sucked out.
[2237.84s -> 2238.84s]  Russell.
[2238.84s -> 2239.84s]  Potentially.
[2239.84s -> 2240.84s]  Maybe not, though.
[2240.84s -> 2241.84s]  I mean, they could just drill into his...
[2241.84s -> 2242.84s]  Stop.
[2242.84s -> 2243.84s]  Oh, yeah.
[2243.88s -> 2244.88s]  Right.
[2244.88s -> 2245.88s]  Well, what they will do is take a train from here...
[2245.88s -> 2246.88s]  What's happening?
[2247.88s -> 2250.88s]  This is Eli to Nova Prospect.
[2251.88s -> 2254.88s]  And if he gets on that train, that's it, right?
[2255.88s -> 2256.88s]  Not necessarily.
[2256.88s -> 2257.88s]  Grab something that represents us.
[2258.88s -> 2262.14s]  It has some cool computers in here, man.
[2263.14s -> 2265.38s]  Grab something that represents us.
[2273.47s -> 2274.47s]  A teacup?
[2274.47s -> 2276.47s]  There's plenty of these around.
[2276.47s -> 2277.47s]  Of course, it's a teacup.
[2277.47s -> 2278.47s]  Okay, that's you.
[2279.47s -> 2280.47s]  That's us.
[2280.47s -> 2281.47s]  I thought you said us.
[2281.51s -> 2285.51s]  Well, one of us, me, will have to stay here for this plan to work.
[2285.51s -> 2286.51s]  All right.
[2286.51s -> 2287.51s]  Fair enough.
[2287.51s -> 2292.51s]  Just outside, there's a second train that also leads out of 717 through the quarantine zone.
[2292.51s -> 2293.51s]  Okay.
[2294.51s -> 2296.51s]  Both trains intersect here at the Fairview Junction.
[2296.51s -> 2297.51s]  I'm ready to go.
[2298.51s -> 2300.51s]  Get there before this train and hack into the controls.
[2301.51s -> 2302.51s]  That'll let me take over the system.
[2303.51s -> 2307.51s]  Train comes to a halt, you deal with the Combine situation, and we get your Dad back.
[2308.51s -> 2309.51s]  Sounds good.
[2309.51s -> 2310.51s]  Where's the train I'm taking?
[2310.55s -> 2311.55s]  Out the back, through the yard.
[2311.55s -> 2312.55s]  Out the back, through the yard.
[2312.55s -> 2314.55s]  It's decommissioned, but I think I can hack into its controls.
[2315.55s -> 2317.55s]  Oh, and get yourself a pair of Russells on the way out.
[2317.55s -> 2319.55s]  Anybody else feel like this is two people under a train show?
[2320.55s -> 2321.55s]  Alex, you know, the Gravity Clubs.
[2322.55s -> 2323.55s]  I have a few sets through there.
[2324.55s -> 2325.55s]  You can calibrate them out by the ship.
[2326.55s -> 2327.55s]  Got it.
[2327.55s -> 2328.55s]  We can do this, Alex.
[2329.55s -> 2330.86s]  You got that, didn't you?
[2330.86s -> 2331.86s]  Though I said we could do it.
[2332.86s -> 2333.86s]  All right, here we go.
[2333.86s -> 2334.86s]  Yeah, we are.
[2334.86s -> 2335.86s]  Oh, yeah.
[2335.86s -> 2336.86s]  This is where you get the portal gun.
[2337.86s -> 2343.38s]  Oh, shit.
[2343.42s -> 2344.42s]  Oh, I...
[2346.62s -> 2347.62s]  That's hard.
[2347.62s -> 2348.62s]  You guys take that up.
[2348.62s -> 2349.62s]  I can't see that.
[2350.62s -> 2355.96s]  You guys are in the way.
[2356.96s -> 2357.96s]  All right, I'll do it.
[2360.48s -> 2361.48s]  What am I touching?
[2361.48s -> 2366.62s]  Back up.
[2366.62s -> 2367.62s]  Time to get a gun?
[2367.62s -> 2379.74s]  Can't even get the light bulb.
[2379.74s -> 2380.74s]  The game's not even good.
[2382.82s -> 2384.06s]  I missed it.
[2384.06s -> 2385.06s]  You missed it.
[2385.06s -> 2388.79s]  What?
[2388.79s -> 2392.02s]  Did I miss something?
[2392.02s -> 2393.02s]  Did I miss?
[2395.22s -> 2396.22s]  I missed it.
[2397.84s -> 2404.11s]  I thought that was really the wall right next to me.
[2404.11s -> 2405.11s]  It's the same color as the wall.
[2406.11s -> 2407.11s]  I thought that was the wall in my house.
[2407.15s -> 2408.15s]  All right, you know how this goes.
[2409.15s -> 2410.15s]  There should be a bunch of junk down there.
[2411.15s -> 2412.15s]  Aim at something with your hand open.
[2413.15s -> 2417.72s]  What?
[2420.75s -> 2421.75s]  You're attached.
[2421.75s -> 2430.54s]  Make a grip.
[2430.54s -> 2431.54s]  Now target something with the rustles.
[2433.42s -> 2434.42s]  Target it.
[2434.42s -> 2435.73s]  Close your hand.
[2436.73s -> 2437.73s]  Register it.
[2437.73s -> 2438.73s]  Now flick your wrist to bring it in.
[2438.73s -> 2439.73s]  Catch it.
[2440.73s -> 2444.78s]  Try again.
[2444.78s -> 2445.78s]  That's it.
[2445.78s -> 2446.78s]  That's cool.
[2446.78s -> 2448.86s]  One more time.
[2448.86s -> 2449.86s]  Yep, you did it.
[2449.86s -> 2451.22s]  Make a grip.
[2451.22s -> 2452.22s]  You've got it.
[2452.22s -> 2453.22s]  Just a little flick of the wrist.
[2453.22s -> 2454.22s]  Just like that.
[2454.22s -> 2455.22s]  Perfect, we're done.
[2455.26s -> 2456.26s]  Oh, wait.
[2456.26s -> 2457.26s]  I almost forgot.
[2458.26s -> 2459.26s]  Alex, up here.
[2459.26s -> 2460.26s]  You're going to need a gun.
[2460.26s -> 2461.26s]  Don't worry.
[2461.26s -> 2462.26s]  It's unloaded.
[2463.95s -> 2465.32s]  It's unloaded now.
[2466.32s -> 2468.26s]  Oh, almost forgot.
[2468.26s -> 2469.26s]  Guns need ammo.
[2470.26s -> 2471.26s]  I really could have used that bullet, Ted.
[2472.26s -> 2473.26s]  Force push.
[2473.26s -> 2476.54s]  Got it.
[2477.54s -> 2481.22s]  Press button or pull slide to do it.
[2484.70s -> 2485.70s]  How much ammo do I have?
[2491.04s -> 2501.69s]  I have a lot of ammo?
[2502.69s -> 2503.69s]  What was the last thing you said?
[2508.11s -> 2509.11s]  At the gnome.
[2509.15s -> 2514.15s]  Where?
[2514.15s -> 2515.15s]  Oh, shit.
[2515.15s -> 2516.15s]  Hold on.
[2516.15s -> 2517.15s]  There's an herb here.
[2517.15s -> 2518.15s]  Resident Evil told me I could eat these.
[2518.15s -> 2531.54s]  This is no.
[2531.54s -> 2532.54s]  What do you want me to do?
[2532.54s -> 2533.97s]  Where's my gun?
[2542.94s -> 2546.10s]  Where are you?
[2546.10s -> 2547.10s]  Where are you guys?
[2547.10s -> 2548.72s]  Okay.
[2548.72s -> 2549.72s]  Move cam top right.
[2549.72s -> 2550.72s]  Let's see if I can do it.
[2550.72s -> 2558.09s]  And go.
[2558.09s -> 2559.09s]  Got it.
[2559.09s -> 2560.09s]  I got it.
[2560.09s -> 2563.06s]  I actually got it.
[2563.06s -> 2565.06s]  Well, okay.
[2565.06s -> 2566.06s]  So what does he want me to do?
[2566.06s -> 2567.06s]  Shoot at his...
[2567.06s -> 2568.06s]  Shoot in his window?
[2569.06s -> 2571.14s]  What does he want me to do?
[2572.14s -> 2576.32s]  Jump over this?
[2576.32s -> 2577.32s]  Can I be able to vault over this?
[2577.32s -> 2589.30s]  Am I blind?
[2589.34s -> 2590.34s]  Well, that, that, that, that, that.
[2590.34s -> 2591.34s]  Okay.
[2591.34s -> 2592.34s]  I don't know where the gnome is, guys.
[2592.34s -> 2598.44s]  All right.
[2598.44s -> 2599.44s]  Shoot this lock off.
[2599.44s -> 2601.13s]  Nice.
[2601.13s -> 2603.30s]  Oh, you took care of that lock then.
[2603.30s -> 2604.30s]  Good.
[2604.30s -> 2605.67s]  Great.
[2605.67s -> 2606.67s]  Did have the key for it.
[2606.67s -> 2607.67s]  But should have given you that.
[2608.67s -> 2609.67s]  More ammo in backpack.
[2618.08s -> 2619.08s]  That didn't work?
[2619.08s -> 2622.43s]  Okay.
[2622.43s -> 2627.13s]  There we go.
[2627.13s -> 2628.13s]  All right.
[2628.13s -> 2629.13s]  Here we go.
[2629.13s -> 2630.13s]  Next stop, Fairview Junction.
[2631.13s -> 2632.13s]  How do you reload?
[2632.13s -> 2633.13s]  And good luck, Alex.
[2633.13s -> 2634.13s]  Goodbye.
[2636.33s -> 2637.33s]  Obviously, just to let you know,
[2637.33s -> 2638.33s]  I am still here though.
[2638.33s -> 2639.33s]  I know.
[2639.37s -> 2644.13s]  Okay.
[2644.13s -> 2648.38s]  Oh, it's a load.
[2648.38s -> 2649.38s]  It is a cool loading screen.
[2650.81s -> 2651.81s]  It shows you the entire Sim,
[2651.81s -> 2652.81s]  Sim City area.
[2653.81s -> 2654.81s]  City Skylines.
[2654.81s -> 2655.81s]  Whatever.
[2655.81s -> 2656.81s]  You think this city is better
[2656.81s -> 2657.81s]  built than anything I build
[2657.81s -> 2658.81s]  in City Skylines?
[2658.81s -> 2659.81s]  Look at this.
[2659.81s -> 2660.81s]  What's the traffic doing over there?
[2662.24s -> 2663.24s]  What kind of roads are these?
[2663.24s -> 2664.24s]  Look at...
[2664.24s -> 2665.24s]  Oh, curved roads.
[2665.24s -> 2666.24s]  Oh, mega-lull.
[2666.24s -> 2667.24s]  Give me a break.
[2667.24s -> 2668.24s]  And I get shit for how I design a city?
[2668.24s -> 2673.10s]  Don't see the loading screen though.
[2673.10s -> 2682.28s]  Hello, Alex?
[2682.28s -> 2683.28s]  We might have a problem.
[2683.28s -> 2685.28s]  Probably nothing to worry about, but...
[2685.28s -> 2687.74s]  I'm just...
[2687.74s -> 2688.74s]  Did the train stop?
[2689.34s -> 2690.34s]  It stopped, didn't it?
[2690.34s -> 2691.34s]  Yeah.
[2691.34s -> 2692.34s]  What happened?
[2692.34s -> 2693.34s]  Oh, it's jammed.
[2693.34s -> 2694.34s]  When the Combine shut down
[2694.34s -> 2695.34s]  the quarantine zone,
[2695.34s -> 2696.34s]  they must have tightened security.
[2696.34s -> 2697.34s]  Which means?
[2698.34s -> 2699.34s]  Yeah, you're nowhere near
[2699.34s -> 2700.34s]  Fairview Junction.
[2700.34s -> 2701.34s]  You're just outside the QZ.
[2702.34s -> 2703.34s]  And this is as far as
[2703.34s -> 2704.34s]  we get by train.
[2705.34s -> 2706.34s]  Then I'm headed on foot.
[2706.34s -> 2707.34s]  Good.
[2707.34s -> 2708.34s]  I'll see if I can get you
[2708.34s -> 2709.34s]  in some other way.
[2710.34s -> 2711.34s]  Here we go.
[2718.08s -> 2719.08s]  Are you guys going to stand up?
[2719.08s -> 2720.08s]  There's a dead zombie here.
[2720.08s -> 2721.08s]  I thought the Combine
[2721.08s -> 2722.08s]  sealed up the QZ.
[2722.08s -> 2723.08s]  Oh.
[2723.08s -> 2725.34s]  This one must have...
[2725.38s -> 2726.38s]  with barnacle spores
[2726.38s -> 2727.38s]  outside the containment area.
[2727.38s -> 2730.74s]  Probably not a one-off then.
[2730.74s -> 2731.74s]  Oh, so you can pick them up?
[2731.74s -> 2732.74s]  I doubt it.
[2735.58s -> 2736.58s]  Press to bring up jump indicator
[2736.58s -> 2737.58s]  or at least...
[2743.74s -> 2744.74s]  I don't think this is going to stand up
[2744.74s -> 2745.74s]  and I'm going to have to shoot it.
[2745.74s -> 2751.21s]  I'll go that way.
[2751.21s -> 2752.21s]  That looks dangerous.
[2753.21s -> 2760.51s]  Wait.
[2760.51s -> 2762.39s]  Ooh!
[2762.39s -> 2763.39s]  That's...
[2763.39s -> 2774.49s]  I'm not going to be very good at that.
[2774.49s -> 2775.49s]  Perch the environment
[2775.49s -> 2776.49s]  for useful items.
[2776.49s -> 2777.49s]  Ooh, what's this?
[2778.49s -> 2780.69s]  Would you look at that?
[2780.69s -> 2781.69s]  And if there's resin around here
[2781.69s -> 2783.69s]  there should be a Combine fabricator.
[2783.69s -> 2784.69s]  Keep an eye out.
[2784.69s -> 2785.69s]  We might be able to upgrade
[2785.69s -> 2786.69s]  your firepower a bit.
[2786.73s -> 2787.73s]  Really?
[2787.73s -> 2788.73s]  This upgrades?
[2794.77s -> 2795.77s]  Wait, was I supposed to wait
[2795.77s -> 2801.49s]  for somebody?
[2801.49s -> 2802.49s]  Key plots?
[2802.49s -> 2803.49s]  Do not enter.
[2803.49s -> 2805.24s]  All right, this is...
[2805.24s -> 2806.24s]  I know something's going to
[2806.24s -> 2807.24s]  fucking jump out.
[2807.24s -> 2808.24s]  They don't give you the gauntlet.
[2808.24s -> 2809.24s]  When the guy comes in
[2809.24s -> 2810.24s]  the one enemy you have to kill.
[2815.64s -> 2816.64s]  I think I can reroute this
[2816.64s -> 2817.64s]  with my multi-tool.
[2817.64s -> 2818.64s]  Your what?
[2818.64s -> 2820.64s]  It's a tool with multiple functions.
[2820.64s -> 2822.64s]  So, you know, multi-tool.
[2823.64s -> 2825.84s]  Oh, it's...
[2825.84s -> 2826.84s]  Okay.
[2826.84s -> 2827.84s]  Use multi-tool.
[2828.84s -> 2834.18s]  This is cool.
[2834.18s -> 2836.18s]  All right, did I just turn the power on?
[2836.22s -> 2841.62s]  Did I not do it long enough?
[2843.88s -> 2848.13s]  Hold on.
[2848.13s -> 2849.13s]  Oh, it's a puzzle game play.
[2849.13s -> 2850.13s]  Alex, that thing's incredible.
[2850.13s -> 2853.22s]  Something that really sells it.
[2854.46s -> 2855.46s]  Who am I going to sell it to?
[2855.46s -> 2856.46s]  I'm not telling you.
[2856.46s -> 2857.46s]  The Combine's not going to be here forever.
[2857.46s -> 2858.46s]  You should be thinking
[2858.46s -> 2859.46s]  about the future, Alex.
[2860.46s -> 2861.46s]  Well, how about I call it...
[2861.46s -> 2862.46s]  His step ladder.
[2862.46s -> 2863.46s]  The...
[2863.46s -> 2864.46s]  Alex.
[2866.02s -> 2867.02s]  It's a little derivative of the Russells,
[2867.02s -> 2869.02s]  but yeah, provisionally, sure.
[2869.02s -> 2870.02s]  The Alex.
[2870.02s -> 2871.02s]  Yeah.
[2872.02s -> 2873.58s]  Sweaty ears.
[2877.13s -> 2878.13s]  I gotta reroute the power
[2879.69s -> 2880.69s]  from here.
[2880.73s -> 2882.42s]  Hold on.
[2883.42s -> 2885.42s]  Oh, just like in Saw.
[2886.42s -> 2890.02s]  Fucking Saw.
[2890.02s -> 2891.26s]  Why is it...
[2892.26s -> 2893.26s]  Russells.
[2894.26s -> 2895.26s]  The Combine use these.
[2896.26s -> 2897.26s]  Are they safe for people?
[2898.26s -> 2899.26s]  Yeah, I use them all the time.
[2900.26s -> 2901.26s]  Wait, what just happened?
[2901.26s -> 2902.26s]  Yeah, they're great.
[2903.26s -> 2904.26s]  Ow.
[2905.26s -> 2913.26s]  Hey, you were right.
[2914.26s -> 2915.26s]  These are great.
[2918.04s -> 2920.11s]  You got a flashlight?
[2920.15s -> 2928.13s]  You have to quickly switch to and from your hand.
[2929.13s -> 2931.75s]  Heavy objects with both hands.
[2932.75s -> 2945.58s]  Don't touch everything.
[2946.58s -> 2947.58s]  I'm touching every single object
[2947.58s -> 2948.58s]  in the whole game world.
[2949.58s -> 2955.49s]  Oh, careful of that barnacle, Alex.
[2956.49s -> 2958.24s]  Oh, these things are in the game?
[2959.24s -> 2961.24s]  Oh, I hated these in Half-Life.
[2963.44s -> 2964.44s]  Oh.
[2973.30s -> 2985.10s]  Is that right?
[2985.10s -> 2986.10s]  Yeah.
[2987.59s -> 2988.59s]  First try.
[2989.59s -> 2990.59s]  They said try again in a year.
[2991.59s -> 2992.59s]  I don't need to tell you
[2992.63s -> 2993.63s]  what happened after that.
[2994.63s -> 2995.63s]  Lucky break for me, really.
[2998.09s -> 2999.09s]  First try, guys.
[2999.09s -> 3000.09s]  Honestly, it's a miracle
[3000.09s -> 3001.78s]  you and your dad got out of it.
[3002.78s -> 3003.78s]  All right, watch out.
[3005.46s -> 3010.67s]  Don't touch that.
[3012.94s -> 3021.28s]  Something moved in there.
[3023.67s -> 3024.67s]  Come here, come here.
[3025.67s -> 3026.67s]  I need you.
[3026.67s -> 3030.54s]  I need you for a minute.
[3031.54s -> 3032.54s]  Get it.
[3032.54s -> 3033.54s]  Did you get it?
[3034.54s -> 3036.03s]  He doesn't want it.
[3037.03s -> 3040.06s]  He's like, eww, gross.
[3040.06s -> 3047.00s]  That's a dead body, dude.
[3057.20s -> 3058.20s]  Get him.
[3058.20s -> 3059.20s]  What are you holding on to?
[3059.24s -> 3060.24s]  Throw that.
[3061.24s -> 3062.24s]  Put it down.
[3063.99s -> 3064.99s]  Take him.
[3064.99s -> 3067.00s]  Take him.
[3067.00s -> 3068.00s]  Take it.
[3071.61s -> 3072.61s]  Come on.
[3073.61s -> 3075.36s]  I'm about to throw this guy out of the bar.
[3076.36s -> 3081.25s]  Oh, God damn it.
[3084.28s -> 3087.18s]  What happened?
[3092.33s -> 3100.67s]  What's going on?
[3100.67s -> 3101.67s]  Where am I?
[3102.67s -> 3106.09s]  I just see a sun setting.
[3114.56s -> 3115.56s]  I think I'm in the ceiling.
[3126.66s -> 3127.66s]  You're out of the play zone.
[3129.02s -> 3136.02s]  I got eaten.
[3137.02s -> 3138.02s]  I got eaten by the barnacle,
[3138.06s -> 3141.06s]  Did I touch it and then just get sucked straight up?
[3142.06s -> 3144.97s]  Hey!
[3157.68s -> 3158.68s]  It doesn't miss.
[3164.14s -> 3165.14s]  Shit, I need that.
[3166.14s -> 3167.14s]  I need that.
[3168.14s -> 3195.00s]  This is the worst ride at Disney World.
[3196.00s -> 3200.86s]  I need to reset.
[3201.86s -> 3202.86s]  I need those things.
[3204.55s -> 3208.55s]  I sucked one of those upgrade stones into the thing's head and it destroyed it.
[3209.55s -> 3210.55s]  I need that thing.
[3211.55s -> 3216.10s]  I don't want to shoot it because that's a waste of money.
[3216.10s -> 3217.10s]  That's a waste of ammo.
[3218.10s -> 3226.57s]  Careful of that barnacle, Alex.
[3235.68s -> 3236.68s]  Okay, I'm ready.
[3237.68s -> 3238.68s]  Yeah.
[3239.68s -> 3241.24s]  Where am I?
[3242.24s -> 3243.24s]  I interviewed at Black Mesa.
[3244.24s -> 3245.24s]  They said try again in a year.
[3247.82s -> 3248.82s]  I'm not going to fuck this up.
[3249.82s -> 3253.54s]  Honestly, it's a miracle you and your dad got out of it.
[3254.54s -> 3255.54s]  Give me that thing.
[3258.25s -> 3264.80s]  Oh, shit.
[3265.80s -> 3270.62s]  I have to shoot them.
[3270.66s -> 3271.66s]  What?
[3271.66s -> 3277.13s]  Fuck.
[3278.30s -> 3280.50s]  Give me that.
[3280.50s -> 3281.50s]  Don't touch anything.
[3281.50s -> 3283.64s]  I missed the resin?
[3283.64s -> 3284.64s]  What?
[3284.64s -> 3285.64s]  No, I didn't.
[3285.64s -> 3288.29s]  Where?
[3288.29s -> 3292.54s]  Where's the resin?
[3292.54s -> 3293.54s]  Oh, right.
[3293.54s -> 3299.77s]  All right, we're good.
[3307.54s -> 3308.90s]  Here we go.
[3308.90s -> 3309.90s]  Ready?
[3309.90s -> 3312.94s]  What the fuck?
[3312.94s -> 3317.63s]  Can I get in here?
[3317.63s -> 3325.08s]  No, wrong fucking guy.
[3326.08s -> 3327.08s]  Should I shoot?
[3327.08s -> 3346.82s]  Kill it?
[3346.82s -> 3347.82s]  How do I reload the gun?
[3350.66s -> 3361.88s]  Let's go.
[3372.59s -> 3373.59s]  Finally.
[3374.59s -> 3386.01s]  Quiet.
[3386.05s -> 3387.05s]  I mean, it is quiet.
[3388.05s -> 3389.54s]  I'm going to get ambushed.
[3389.54s -> 3390.54s]  How many do I have in this gun?
[3390.54s -> 3391.54s]  Six.
[3391.54s -> 3393.54s]  I take it the quarantine zone is behind this hatch?
[3394.54s -> 3395.54s]  Yeah, yeah, that's where they keep it.
[3397.10s -> 3398.10s]  Look around for a control panel.
[3399.10s -> 3400.10s]  Oh, no, no control panel.
[3401.10s -> 3402.10s]  Shoot that thing and it'll go ding!
[3403.10s -> 3404.10s]  It'll turn to green.
[3405.10s -> 3407.30s]  I mean, it was worth the shot.
[3408.30s -> 3416.54s]  I didn't even know I was back there.
[3417.54s -> 3434.85s]  I can't wait to upgrade.
[3434.85s -> 3435.85s]  This is going to be so much fun.
[3436.85s -> 3437.85s]  What about anything over here?
[3437.85s -> 3445.68s]  The combine?
[3445.68s -> 3446.68s]  Where would I put a control panel?
[3447.86s -> 3448.86s]  Oh, does that hurt?
[3449.86s -> 3458.71s]  Is shit in here?
[3462.38s -> 3466.63s]  These things are everywhere.
[3468.58s -> 3469.58s]  This is like an Easter egg hunt.
[3470.58s -> 3473.10s]  This is awesome.
[3491.87s -> 3497.59s]  I hear a bug.
[3498.59s -> 3501.11s]  Why am I looking in the toilet?
[3502.11s -> 3503.11s]  What the fuck is wrong with me?
[3504.11s -> 3505.11s]  I thought that was going to be a resin stone.
[3510.83s -> 3511.83s]  I got a lot of these.
[3517.42s -> 3518.42s]  My face is itchy.
[3519.42s -> 3521.24s]  That's a bad sign.
[3522.24s -> 3524.24s]  Is this how the speedrunners do this game?
[3531.69s -> 3532.69s]  Okay, we're looking for a control panel.
[3532.73s -> 3533.73s]  That's it right there, isn't it?
[3534.73s -> 3537.82s]  Climb this.
[3543.42s -> 3544.42s]  Control panel.
[3544.42s -> 3545.42s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[3545.42s -> 3546.78s]  I have a tool.
[3550.20s -> 3552.20s]  I feel like I'm struck by lightning doing this.
[3553.20s -> 3554.20s]  This is like a Chevy Chase movie.
[3555.20s -> 3556.20s]  Oh, I got it.
[3557.20s -> 3558.20s]  I'm just trying to get a signal.
[3559.20s -> 3560.20s]  Yikes!
[3561.50s -> 3562.50s]  What do I do?
[3563.50s -> 3564.50s]  That up there?
[3567.79s -> 3568.79s]  Harry Potter joke incoming.
[3569.79s -> 3570.79s]  What do you mean by Harry?
[3571.79s -> 3573.48s]  That's a control panel right here.
[3573.52s -> 3574.52s]  This is electricity, right here.
[3576.08s -> 3577.08s]  This is an electricity panel.
[3579.98s -> 3595.82s]  What the hell is this?
[3596.82s -> 3600.30s]  Look with your special eyes.
[3601.30s -> 3603.69s]  Aren't I doing that?
[3604.69s -> 3606.31s]  This is definitely a control panel.
[3607.31s -> 3608.49s]  Absolutely.
[3609.66s -> 3610.66s]  It has a handle on it.
[3612.74s -> 3613.74s]  Look, it's got a handle on it.
[3615.17s -> 3616.17s]  Am I dead?
[3625.54s -> 3628.38s]  Follow the wire.
[3629.38s -> 3630.38s]  I think I may have found it.
[3644.35s -> 3652.54s]  Oh, you grabbed me, you resin evil.
[3653.54s -> 3662.34s]  Yep, up there.
[3662.38s -> 3675.46s]  Wait, I keep climbing the window.
[3676.46s -> 3677.46s]  Oh, you're alive?
[3681.32s -> 3682.32s]  Oh, that's me making that noise.
[3683.32s -> 3684.32s]  I need this window, dude.
[3685.32s -> 3687.33s]  Wait a minute.
[3688.33s -> 3690.21s]  Stay right there.
[3691.21s -> 3692.21s]  And before your very eyes,
[3693.21s -> 3694.21s]  I'm going to take the dollar out of your pocket
[3695.21s -> 3696.21s]  and put it in your girlfriend's.
[3697.21s -> 3698.21s]  Can you believe it?
[3699.21s -> 3700.21s]  Street magic with Gerber 985.
[3701.21s -> 3705.52s]  I'll get it, sir.
[3719.30s -> 3720.30s]  Not what I'm supposed to do?
[3726.09s -> 3729.25s]  Fuck.
[3733.30s -> 3735.70s]  Can I just push it?
[3736.70s -> 3737.70s]  Oh my god, oh my god, I can't use this.
[3738.70s -> 3753.87s]  Ah, a lot of shit in here.
[3754.87s -> 3763.46s]  Okay, right here?
[3764.46s -> 3765.89s]  Look at that.
[3770.39s -> 3771.39s]  Ooh, cigarette.
[3775.70s -> 3776.70s]  Okay, if you put it into your mouth,
[3777.70s -> 3778.94s]  it just goes right in.
[3778.94s -> 3779.94s]  Really important.
[3785.86s -> 3792.28s]  Anyone have an ashtray?
[3793.28s -> 3797.91s]  A control panel, wait.
[3803.12s -> 3804.12s]  There?
[3805.49s -> 3806.49s]  There's something I can turn on in there, right?
[3807.49s -> 3808.49s]  There's something I can turn on over there.
[3812.74s -> 3819.40s]  Control panel.
[3820.40s -> 3821.40s]  I've probably scrambled the circuit,
[3821.44s -> 3822.44s]  but considering no one would be dumb enough
[3823.44s -> 3824.44s]  to open the hatch,
[3825.44s -> 3828.09s]  it shouldn't be too hard to put back.
[3829.09s -> 3830.09s]  Okay, wait.
[3831.09s -> 3832.09s]  How much debt do I have?
[3833.39s -> 3836.10s]  I got full health, I don't need that.
[3837.10s -> 3838.10s]  Okay, let's go.
[3839.41s -> 3841.03s]  Oops, who are you?
[3842.46s -> 3851.00s]  What's that?
[3854.86s -> 3864.87s]  Okay, multi-tool.
[3865.87s -> 3866.87s]  How much?
[3867.87s -> 3868.87s]  Oh, okay.
[3869.87s -> 3870.87s]  I need to put a device in here?
[3871.87s -> 3875.22s]  Yeah, I need to put a tube in there.
[3876.22s -> 3880.66s]  How's that?
[3880.70s -> 3891.54s]  All right, what's that?
[3893.49s -> 3898.38s]  Does it explode?
[3899.38s -> 3906.12s]  Is that to put?
[3913.12s -> 3919.86s]  Where does it want me to go?
[3922.64s -> 3925.39s]  I don't understand which one it goes in.
[3926.39s -> 3928.66s]  How do I tell?
[3929.66s -> 3930.66s]  Can I tell?
[3931.66s -> 3938.72s]  Can I get a thing that tells me?
[3942.33s -> 3943.33s]  Oh, can I get an emergency thing?
[3944.57s -> 3946.57s]  Now that I'm walking into the quarantine zone,
[3947.57s -> 3948.57s]  it just hit me.
[3949.57s -> 3950.57s]  Is that in the game?
[3951.57s -> 3953.19s]  Well, actually, the word quarantine
[3953.23s -> 3954.23s]  means 40 days.
[3955.23s -> 3956.23s]  Oh, shit.
[3957.23s -> 3958.23s]  The period that all ships were required to be isolated
[3959.23s -> 3960.23s]  before crew could go ashore during the Black Death.
[3961.23s -> 3962.23s]  That's an amber alert.
[3963.23s -> 3964.23s]  Let me look at this for a sec.
[3968.80s -> 3974.90s]  It's not around here.
[3975.90s -> 3976.90s]  I thought that was in the game.
[3977.90s -> 3980.90s]  I was like, that's the complete demission sound?
[3990.78s -> 3991.78s]  Yeah, it's in Utah, apparently.
[3996.67s -> 3997.67s]  Jesus Christ.
[4004.35s -> 4005.35s]  Hold on.
[4006.35s -> 4007.35s]  Actually, I'm going to take this opportunity to pee
[4008.35s -> 4009.35s]  and this is so fogged up in here.
[4010.35s -> 4011.35s]  I've been playing for a fucking hour.
[4012.35s -> 4013.35s]  It's been like 10 minutes.
[4019.46s -> 4020.46s]  Holy shit, I must be having a lot of fun.
[4021.46s -> 4022.46s]  All right, let me go get a water
[4023.46s -> 4025.59s]  and let me just clean this out.
[4026.59s -> 4180.78s]  I'll be right back.
[4181.78s -> 4185.64s]  Okay, I'm back.
[4186.64s -> 4187.64s]  The worst part about VR
[4188.64s -> 4189.64s]  is you get so sweaty in this thing
[4191.46s -> 4192.46s]  that I almost wish there was a way
[4193.46s -> 4194.46s]  to make it so like you didn't bog up
[4195.46s -> 4196.46s]  the lenses every 40 minutes.
[4202.37s -> 4204.44s]  Are you guys counting?
[4205.44s -> 4206.44s]  Spectator smoothing.
[4210.24s -> 4211.24s]  The spectator smoothing is on high.
[4212.24s -> 4222.22s]  I'm out right now, so
[4223.72s -> 4225.09s]  are we good?
[4226.09s -> 4227.09s]  Let me just do a check here.
[4236.01s -> 4237.01s]  Are we good?
[4239.21s -> 4240.21s]  I'm making sure because when I'm in there
[4241.21s -> 4242.21s]  it's kind of hard to, you get in VR
[4243.21s -> 4246.37s]  and you can't even tell what's going on.
[4247.37s -> 4248.37s]  How are the subtitles?
[4249.37s -> 4250.37s]  Oh, I don't see that on the screen.
[4251.37s -> 4252.37s]  That would be awesome if I could see
[4253.37s -> 4254.37s]  how much health and breath.
[4255.37s -> 4256.37s]  I'm going to have to ask you guys these things
[4258.31s -> 4263.39s]  because I don't even see that shit.
[4265.59s -> 4266.59s]  I'm going back in.
[4266.63s -> 4267.63s]  Chat is on that hand too,
[4268.63s -> 4269.63s]  so when I see how much health I have
[4270.63s -> 4271.63s]  I see you guys spamming like omega lulz.
[4279.66s -> 4280.66s]  Move it.
[4281.66s -> 4284.37s]  No, I can't, it has to be on my left hand.
[4285.37s -> 4286.37s]  My right hand is my shooting hand.
[4287.37s -> 4288.37s]  I can't be like in the middle of shooting
[4289.37s -> 4290.37s]  and be like, hey guys, hey, hold on a minute.
[4291.37s -> 4294.21s]  What are you saying?
[4295.21s -> 4296.21s]  No, that's not going to happen.
[4297.58s -> 4298.58s]  That's better.
[4299.58s -> 4303.25s]  Better, better, better.
[4304.25s -> 4305.55s]  Oh boy, it's starting to crush my eyes.
[4306.55s -> 4307.55s]  All right, let's go.
[4308.55s -> 4309.55s]  We're good?
[4309.59s -> 4311.98s]  Look at it.
[4317.58s -> 4318.58s]  Okay, we're good.
[4329.35s -> 4330.35s]  Oh, there it is.
[4331.35s -> 4341.49s]  There's the power thing.
[4342.49s -> 4343.49s]  I'm sick.
[4344.49s -> 4345.49s]  What am I, like 60, 70% of the way through the game?
[4346.49s -> 4347.49s]  Maybe 80% of the way through the game?
[4370.42s -> 4371.42s]  It's pretty good so far.
[4375.93s -> 4377.23s]  It didn't do anything?
[4378.23s -> 4382.03s]  What's in there?
[4383.59s -> 4384.90s]  There's like guts in here.
[4385.90s -> 4386.90s]  Oh, don't, no.
[4387.90s -> 4388.90s]  Get him out of there.
[4389.90s -> 4390.90s]  Oh no, he's like part of it.
[4392.84s -> 4393.84s]  Part of it.
[4396.74s -> 4404.06s]  What the hell?
[4405.06s -> 4407.14s]  How do we get him out of there?
[4410.30s -> 4411.30s]  I can't.
[4412.60s -> 4415.38s]  It's the inception sound.
[4416.38s -> 4417.38s]  That's the inception music.
[4420.73s -> 4422.22s]  Ha ha.
[4424.68s -> 4425.68s]  Finally.
[4426.68s -> 4428.68s]  You'll go through the old subway tunnels on your way to the train yard.
[4430.18s -> 4431.18s]  Have they started moving down yet?
[4432.18s -> 4434.18s]  I don't think so, which is good news because we've still got time.
[4435.18s -> 4436.18s]  Great.
[4437.18s -> 4438.18s]  Or bad news because they've already killed them
[4439.42s -> 4440.42s]  and you don't need to move a corpse.
[4441.42s -> 4442.42s]  You just bury it.
[4445.90s -> 4446.90s]  Yeah.
[4448.71s -> 4449.71s]  Can that get on me every five minutes?
[4450.71s -> 4454.00s]  Get that gun out.
[4454.00s -> 4455.00s]  I feel like it's going to be trouble.
[4468.08s -> 4477.38s]  Load it.
[4477.38s -> 4478.38s]  Russell, are you seeing this?
[4479.38s -> 4481.46s]  What is this?
[4482.46s -> 4483.70s]  Great.
[4483.70s -> 4486.28s]  There we go.
[4492.26s -> 4493.26s]  Can I take that?
[4494.26s -> 4517.11s]  It's so annoying.
[4518.11s -> 4520.31s]  I tried to shoot the alien, whatever.
[4521.31s -> 4527.35s]  I haven't seen any resin for a little while.
[4528.35s -> 4537.27s]  Oh, why not?
[4538.27s -> 4540.79s]  Oh, all right.
[4541.79s -> 4546.36s]  Next part of the game.
[4546.40s -> 4547.40s]  Resin.
[4550.24s -> 4551.24s]  Been at the same bit for 20 minutes.
[4552.24s -> 4553.24s]  I took a break too.
[4554.24s -> 4556.31s]  That's going to explode.
[4557.31s -> 4558.31s]  That's going to explode.
[4559.31s -> 4560.31s]  That's an explosive barrel.
[4560.31s -> 4561.31s]  It's going to blow up.
[4565.94s -> 4566.94s]  It doesn't work every time.
[4571.06s -> 4572.06s]  Hey, Russell.
[4573.06s -> 4574.06s]  I just found a loose syringe of God knows what.
[4575.30s -> 4576.86s]  Is this medicine?
[4577.86s -> 4579.55s]  Does it have a skull and cross spines on it?
[4580.55s -> 4581.55s]  I don't see one.
[4582.55s -> 4583.55s]  Adrenaline should probably be medicine then.
[4587.29s -> 4589.29s]  Back in like 2004 when this was ridiculous.
[4592.45s -> 4593.45s]  God, how we've gone so far.
[4594.45s -> 4599.01s]  Back in 2004, this was like showing the movie of the train to the people in the 1800s.
[4600.01s -> 4601.01s]  They thought they were going to get hit by the fucking train.
[4602.01s -> 4604.57s]  The first movie ever when everyone in the audience was like,
[4605.57s -> 4606.57s]  the train's going to hit us.
[4607.57s -> 4609.57s]  That was 2004 with like the first physics based game.
[4610.57s -> 4615.58s]  Is there a...
[4617.46s -> 4618.46s]  This is going to explode.
[4619.46s -> 4620.46s]  Resin, search.
[4621.46s -> 4623.92s]  Any resin?
[4627.21s -> 4628.21s]  No, that's stupid.
[4632.97s -> 4633.97s]  The old prospector.
[4634.01s -> 4635.01s]  The old prospector.
[4636.01s -> 4637.01s]  Don't go near that one.
[4638.01s -> 4639.01s]  Let me see.
[4640.01s -> 4641.01s]  I've got a lantern here.
[4642.01s -> 4643.01s]  Let's see if I can see where the gold is.
[4644.01s -> 4645.01s]  Get that fucking guy away from us.
[4646.01s -> 4647.01s]  Don't do that.
[4664.38s -> 4665.38s]  Get the old man out of here.
[4669.37s -> 4670.37s]  I changed my mind.
[4671.37s -> 4673.18s]  I want it.
[4674.18s -> 4675.18s]  Let's take a look and see.
[4676.18s -> 4678.38s]  Be careful.
[4682.06s -> 4683.06s]  I heard there were monsters down here.
[4685.13s -> 4686.13s]  Oops.
[4687.13s -> 4688.13s]  I can't hold it.
[4689.62s -> 4698.80s]  Oh, it's one of these guys.
[4699.80s -> 4700.80s]  I heard they will suck on your brain.
[4701.80s -> 4702.80s]  Yeah, that is.
[4703.80s -> 4706.58s]  Eat this, motherfucker.
[4707.58s -> 4708.58s]  Oh, it didn't go far enough.
[4710.97s -> 4711.97s]  Oh, shit, I missed.
[4718.78s -> 4719.78s]  I could have had him just suck it up.
[4729.66s -> 4730.66s]  Clock it, clock it, clock it.
[4753.72s -> 4754.72s]  That seemed to work.
[4759.93s -> 4762.13s]  Keep doing that.
[4763.13s -> 4764.13s]  I got it.
[4765.37s -> 4769.49s]  Clock it, clock it.
[4770.49s -> 4771.49s]  Yeah, clock it.
[4778.36s -> 4780.50s]  Oh, quick.
[4780.54s -> 4785.70s]  Oh, just so you know, the Russells have a built-in display.
[4788.09s -> 4789.09s]  The show might come in handy.
[4790.09s -> 4791.09s]  Yeah, I got it.
[4795.08s -> 4796.08s]  Thanks.
[4797.38s -> 4798.38s]  Check for resin.
[4805.70s -> 4806.70s]  I haven't gotten any resin.
[4811.78s -> 4812.78s]  I'm terrible.
[4818.70s -> 4819.70s]  Is resin this bad at the game or am I not seeing any?
[4822.41s -> 4823.41s]  What's a gas mask?
[4824.41s -> 4827.50s]  I put it on.
[4828.50s -> 4829.50s]  Holy shit, I didn't even know you could do that.
[4830.74s -> 4831.74s]  I heard a noise.
[4832.74s -> 4841.09s]  I heard somebody heard a noise.
[4842.09s -> 4843.58s]  Oh, this is a Ghostbusters thing.
[4844.58s -> 4848.58s]  Do I actually need that, though?
[4849.58s -> 4864.96s]  Oh, shit, all right, good.
[4865.96s -> 4870.14s]  Oh, what's the point of doing that?
[4871.14s -> 4879.74s]  Just go like this.
[4881.62s -> 4886.51s]  This is fun.
[4887.51s -> 4891.50s]  Can you do it to the skull?
[4892.50s -> 4898.61s]  Oh, get the hat.
[4902.02s -> 4904.61s]  I don't need a hat.
[4907.00s -> 4908.62s]  I don't need a hat.
[4911.91s -> 4912.91s]  I have nine resins.
[4913.91s -> 4914.91s]  Is that good?
[4917.56s -> 4919.44s]  How much ammo is in this?
[4920.44s -> 4921.94s]  Can you tell how much bullets?
[4922.94s -> 4925.39s]  Wait, does it say that on here?
[4941.22s -> 4942.22s]  Look, bud.
[4949.61s -> 4954.88s]  How am I going to let this mean lover try to get over here
[4955.88s -> 4956.88s]  and try to shoot me?
[4957.88s -> 4964.05s]  I don't work.
[4968.17s -> 4986.94s]  Smash his head.
[4996.44s -> 4997.44s]  Back.
[5008.66s -> 5009.66s]  Am I shitting him?
[5023.43s -> 5027.81s]  Out of here.
[5029.56s -> 5030.99s]  Lock it in the head.
[5031.99s -> 5036.82s]  Do you think I'm aiming for his toes?
[5037.82s -> 5038.82s]  I have 90 ammo.
[5040.06s -> 5041.06s]  Are you serious?
[5042.06s -> 5044.90s]  Why am I trying so hard to not waste it?
[5050.94s -> 5051.94s]  Ace, what's in it?
[5055.61s -> 5057.23s]  Oh, there's a lock on it?
[5058.23s -> 5059.23s]  Of course it's impossible to get into.
[5060.23s -> 5075.10s]  It's a Samsonite.
[5076.10s -> 5078.43s]  I'll jump for that guy.
[5079.43s -> 5080.43s]  I like to pick him up and pretend to be an alien.
[5097.48s -> 5099.87s]  Oh, shit.
[5100.87s -> 5101.87s]  Oh, man.
[5102.87s -> 5103.87s]  I don't want to do it, man.
[5104.87s -> 5129.58s]  I don't want to do it.
[5130.58s -> 5131.82s]  How much ammo is in this?
[5132.82s -> 5133.82s]  Six.
[5139.99s -> 5140.99s]  This is fun as fuck.
[5141.99s -> 5146.50s]  What is that?
[5147.50s -> 5151.10s]  Is this a coffin?
[5152.10s -> 5153.10s]  Alex, I think that's a combined fabricator.
[5154.10s -> 5155.10s]  Put something in it.
[5156.10s -> 5157.10s]  Will it work on a Russell's?
[5158.10s -> 5159.10s]  No, but it should fix up that pistol nicely.
[5160.10s -> 5161.10s]  Good thing, too.
[5161.10s -> 5162.10s]  I gave you one of my lesser gum.
[5163.10s -> 5164.10s]  Resin?
[5165.10s -> 5166.10s]  Thanks, Russell.
[5167.10s -> 5168.10s]  Resin?
[5169.10s -> 5170.10s]  Oh, resin.
[5171.10s -> 5172.10s]  Come on, it's got to be resin in here somewhere.
[5173.10s -> 5175.94s]  Come on, man.
[5176.94s -> 5181.64s]  It's got to be resin.
[5182.64s -> 5187.59s]  All right, it'll do.
[5191.58s -> 5195.32s]  See?
[5196.32s -> 5197.56s]  Wait.
[5198.56s -> 5200.56s]  This is probably resin in this old grandmother's attic box.
[5201.56s -> 5202.56s]  I knew it.
[5203.99s -> 5204.99s]  Any more?
[5206.87s -> 5222.13s]  I can't put the glove on.
[5223.13s -> 5227.70s]  Can I open this?
[5228.70s -> 5229.70s]  Fun. Very fun.
[5230.70s -> 5234.82s]  Wait a minute, over here.
[5239.77s -> 5241.07s]  Batteries?
[5242.07s -> 5243.89s]  I'm a resin boy right now.
[5244.89s -> 5247.34s]  All right, I think I got it.
[5249.80s -> 5254.50s]  Please take the hat off.
[5255.50s -> 5269.58s]  There's only the hat?
[5270.58s -> 5277.78s]  Get over here.
[5278.78s -> 5279.78s]  Oh, I get it.
[5280.78s -> 5284.13s]  You got to have the line go through everything.
[5298.94s -> 5299.94s]  I got it.
[5305.40s -> 5307.40s]  It takes a second to figure out a puzzle.
[5308.40s -> 5315.27s]  Oh, man.
[5316.27s -> 5317.96s]  Oh, man.
[5318.96s -> 5319.96s]  Oh, man.
[5320.96s -> 5321.96s]  Oh, yeah, this is cool.
[5322.96s -> 5323.96s]  Reflex site?
[5324.96s -> 5325.96s]  Or should I hold the laser reflex site?
[5329.44s -> 5330.44s]  I might as well.
[5335.46s -> 5339.96s]  I always feel like this.
[5340.96s -> 5343.96s]  Whenever you go to a store and they have the iPad that you have to sign and touch,
[5344.96s -> 5345.96s]  I'm always like, I don't want to touch this screen, man.
[5346.96s -> 5348.33s]  Reflex sucks.
[5350.66s -> 5351.66s]  It's terrible.
[5351.70s -> 5353.77s]  Is it?
[5354.77s -> 5355.77s]  Whatever, I'm good.
[5364.37s -> 5365.37s]  How do I insert resin?
[5366.80s -> 5378.82s]  Oh, oh, reflex is ass.
[5379.82s -> 5380.82s]  It's all right.
[5383.72s -> 5384.96s]  Looks pretty cool.
[5385.96s -> 5386.96s]  What are you talking about?
[5387.96s -> 5392.80s]  Wait, so that circle is not my crosshair.
[5393.80s -> 5394.80s]  How does that suck?
[5398.66s -> 5399.66s]  That's sick.
[5400.97s -> 5401.97s]  Who's this head so much?
[5402.97s -> 5409.97s]  I mean, am I moving my head too much?
[5414.54s -> 5415.54s]  Fun guy.
[5415.58s -> 5417.52s]  All right, let's, let's heal.
[5418.52s -> 5426.03s]  Oh, I can see the dot.
[5427.03s -> 5432.00s]  Oh, this is actually going to be fucking kind of hard to use.
[5433.00s -> 5434.00s]  I get it now.
[5439.46s -> 5440.46s]  I'm hurting them.
[5446.38s -> 5447.38s]  All right, I'm good.
[5448.38s -> 5449.38s]  I got my reflex site.
[5451.13s -> 5452.13s]  I've got my ready to go site.
[5453.13s -> 5460.06s]  But my resin, it's all right.
[5461.06s -> 5467.23s]  There's tons of resin in the game.
[5469.11s -> 5473.87s]  Right out.
[5474.87s -> 5475.87s]  Oh, my God.
[5482.49s -> 5483.49s]  Lock it.
[5507.26s -> 5509.46s]  It actually, I, it doesn't, it's actually kind of good.
[5514.15s -> 5515.15s]  Seriously.
[5516.15s -> 5517.15s]  It highlights the head.
[5519.42s -> 5524.75s]  No.
[5525.75s -> 5534.48s]  You guys see what I'm saying, right?
[5535.48s -> 5536.48s]  Oh, my God.
[5545.14s -> 5546.14s]  I thought it was going to explode.
[5555.32s -> 5556.32s]  Oh, buddy.
[5557.75s -> 5567.38s]  Oh, buddy.
[5576.55s -> 5577.55s]  Get out of here.
[5578.55s -> 5579.55s]  It's not bad.
[5584.55s -> 5585.55s]  What?
[5586.55s -> 5587.55s]  I don't know what you could do.
[5590.39s -> 5591.39s]  Somebody came in the door.
[5594.23s -> 5595.23s]  You can do that.
[5598.26s -> 5599.26s]  All right.
[5602.04s -> 5603.04s]  Resident search, thank you.
[5634.60s -> 5635.60s]  What the fuck is this?
[5639.27s -> 5640.27s]  Oh, my God.
[5641.27s -> 5642.27s]  Resident Evil 4 taught me so well.
[5658.04s -> 5659.22s]  I don't have any more.
[5661.16s -> 5662.16s]  I got plenty.
[5663.16s -> 5664.16s]  Any complainers?
[5668.47s -> 5669.47s]  Any complainers?
[5670.47s -> 5671.47s]  Five minutes you play.
[5672.47s -> 5676.47s]  Guys, something that you guys have to remember is Resident Evil 4 was the original GTA V.
[5676.51s -> 5679.82s]  What I mean by that is they came out with the game.
[5680.82s -> 5682.82s]  They've re-released it like eight times.
[5683.82s -> 5684.82s]  This is like before Skyrim did this.
[5685.82s -> 5686.82s]  This is before Resident Evil 5.
[5687.82s -> 5688.82s]  I mean before GTA V did this.
[5689.82s -> 5690.82s]  They released it on like 12 different consoles.
[5691.82s -> 5692.82s]  I've played through it like four times.
[5693.82s -> 5702.65s]  Why are you talking about releases?
[5705.62s -> 5706.62s]  Somebody just said I've never played.
[5707.62s -> 5709.62s]  Somebody said I've played four minutes of Resident Evil 4.
[5710.62s -> 5711.62s]  They don't understand.
[5722.39s -> 5723.39s]  What's that?
[5723.43s -> 5724.43s]  I see it.
[5725.86s -> 5726.86s]  The what?
[5727.86s -> 5749.58s]  The lamp?
[5750.58s -> 5752.21s]  I hear it.
[5753.21s -> 5754.77s]  I hear this motherfucker up in that vent.
[5755.77s -> 5756.77s]  I heard him in the vent.
[5758.78s -> 5759.78s]  He's in the vent.
[5760.78s -> 5761.78s]  I know he's in the vent.
[5764.17s -> 5765.17s]  I know you're in that fucking vent.
[5775.18s -> 5781.60s]  I see him.
[5782.60s -> 5791.71s]  I hate those things.
[5792.71s -> 5793.71s]  Do what he just did.
[5797.45s -> 5798.94s]  Can I ask a question?
[5799.94s -> 5802.94s]  Why do I continue to make Among Us references when I've never played the game?
[5803.94s -> 5807.91s]  I don't even play that game.
[5808.91s -> 5809.91s]  Why do I keep doing that?
[5810.91s -> 5811.91s]  I don't even watch it.
[5812.91s -> 5813.91s]  I don't even care.
[5814.91s -> 5815.91s]  I'm never going to play it.
[5816.91s -> 5818.98s]  I don't get it.
[5819.98s -> 5820.98s]  How do I know all this?
[5821.98s -> 5822.98s]  I need to stay relevant.
[5823.98s -> 5825.54s]  I'm not even trying to.
[5826.54s -> 5827.54s]  It's just for some reason.
[5828.54s -> 5829.54s]  I'm just talking about it all the time.
[5830.54s -> 5845.69s]  I talk about Among Us more than I make WoW references at this point.
[5847.44s -> 5848.44s]  That's how you know there's a problem.
[5848.48s -> 5849.48s]  I don't even watch that fucking game.
[5850.48s -> 5851.48s]  You don't even know what I'm talking about.
[5852.48s -> 5853.48s]  I know half of you have played WoW.
[5864.83s -> 5865.83s]  Untrue, untrue.
[5866.83s -> 5867.83s]  No, come on.
[5870.10s -> 5871.10s]  Everybody's played WoW at some point in their life.
[5872.10s -> 5873.10s]  Even if you got the get to level 10 trial and said,
[5874.10s -> 5875.10s]  this game sucks, I'm never playing it again.
[5876.10s -> 5878.10s]  Get pissed off at your friend that introduced you to it.
[5879.10s -> 5880.10s]  Be like, dude, fuck it.
[5881.10s -> 5886.30s]  I'm not playing this stupid game.
[5888.25s -> 5889.25s]  Level 20, whatever.
[5890.25s -> 5891.25s]  No.
[5892.25s -> 5893.25s]  Radio silence since you got on the train.
[5893.29s -> 5894.29s]  Damn.
[5895.29s -> 5896.29s]  Well, the good news is he's probably fine.
[5897.29s -> 5898.29s]  How do you know that?
[5899.29s -> 5900.29s]  Because they're taking him to Nova Prospect to toy with him.
[5901.29s -> 5902.29s]  Oh, shit.
[5903.29s -> 5904.29s]  So they're hardly going to toy with him.
[5908.79s -> 5920.46s]  Yo, what's up?
[5921.46s -> 5922.46s]  When did I get hit?
[5928.38s -> 5932.43s]  That box?
[5935.72s -> 5936.72s]  I didn't think that was going to do anything.
[5945.32s -> 5946.32s]  I need a thing over there.
[5953.70s -> 5954.70s]  Wait, resin.
[5955.70s -> 5956.70s]  I need to make a new indentation on my face.
[5957.70s -> 5962.53s]  There we go.
[5962.57s -> 5963.57s]  Get this shit out of me.
[5967.75s -> 5971.74s]  That's in.
[5973.69s -> 5976.08s]  That's in.
[5987.43s -> 5993.09s]  That's in.
[5994.52s -> 5995.52s]  I have to try this.
[6002.20s -> 6007.92s]  Floppy disk.
[6008.92s -> 6009.92s]  We used to store information on them.
[6012.50s -> 6014.50s]  Specifically, two micrometers of magnetic iron oxide.
[6015.50s -> 6018.73s]  Three micrometers.
[6019.73s -> 6020.73s]  How do you know all that?
[6021.73s -> 6022.73s]  I'm reading it here on my computer.
[6023.73s -> 6024.73s]  I downloaded the internet before the war.
[6025.73s -> 6026.73s]  You downloaded the entire internet?
[6027.73s -> 6028.73s]  Most of it.
[6028.77s -> 6029.77s]  That's Tim and Eric.
[6030.77s -> 6031.77s]  Got the whole internet on this one CD.
[6032.77s -> 6033.77s]  That's one of the best bits.
[6034.77s -> 6039.77s]  One of the best skits of any comedy television show is the internet on the CD bit that Tim and Eric did.
[6040.77s -> 6041.77s]  That's one of the best.
[6042.77s -> 6050.60s]  Ah, there we go.
[6065.60s -> 6066.60s]  Hosted all options.
[6069.12s -> 6075.86s]  Heal.
[6093.30s -> 6099.27s]  That healer.
[6101.60s -> 6102.60s]  No, it's somewhere.
[6116.58s -> 6117.58s]  What did I do with it?
[6118.58s -> 6121.86s]  What?
[6122.86s -> 6127.24s]  What do you mean, what the fuck?
[6128.24s -> 6129.24s]  What happened to this?
[6139.31s -> 6140.31s]  I got ultra-resident instinct.
[6162.99s -> 6163.99s]  What the hell is that?
[6167.02s -> 6168.02s]  Is this electricity or what?
[6171.57s -> 6172.57s]  Can I walk into it?
[6173.57s -> 6174.57s]  Wait a minute, I'm going to throw something in there and see what happens.
[6179.39s -> 6183.64s]  Safe.
[6184.64s -> 6185.64s]  It's an eye.
[6186.64s -> 6187.64s]  It looks like garbage.
[6188.64s -> 6190.84s]  Right.
[6191.84s -> 6192.84s]  It seems harmless.
[6193.84s -> 6194.84s]  Can I put my hand in this?
[6195.84s -> 6207.62s]  This is why I can't play Luigi's Mansion.
[6208.62s -> 6210.43s]  Fuck.
[6210.47s -> 6211.47s]  I'm sorry.
[6224.42s -> 6225.42s]  Aha, aha, aha.
[6242.41s -> 6243.58s]  Okay.
[6244.58s -> 6252.61s]  Resident anywhere else?
[6258.84s -> 6273.01s]  Let's go.
[6275.66s -> 6276.66s]  Alright, I made it out.
[6278.60s -> 6279.60s]  I have to press the series of buttons.
[6280.60s -> 6287.33s]  I'm so glad to be outside.
[6288.33s -> 6289.33s]  Is this like Kinect 4?
[6315.70s -> 6318.70s]  Calling it now, he's going to hit the two correct ones accidentally.
[6319.70s -> 6322.61s]  I don't know what makes them correct.
[6323.61s -> 6336.94s]  One of these is the right combo.
[6337.94s -> 6346.16s]  Going anywhere?
[6347.66s -> 6348.66s]  Oh wait, they're over there.
[6349.66s -> 6353.73s]  This is just the thing that's in the doctor's office to keep your child occupied.
[6354.73s -> 6363.46s]  It'll say it right here.
[6364.46s -> 6373.76s]  Look, look, look at that.
[6374.76s -> 6375.76s]  Would you look at that?
[6376.76s -> 6378.70s]  This tomb is a lot of them.
[6379.70s -> 6382.74s]  Which one is the right one?
[6383.74s -> 6386.26s]  Any of these.
[6391.40s -> 6402.24s]  Do I have to try them all?
[6403.24s -> 6404.93s]  Alright, it's that one and that one.
[6405.93s -> 6410.54s]  Second row three, fourth row two.
[6411.54s -> 6413.35s]  Second row three, fourth row two.
[6414.35s -> 6423.53s]  Try every single one.
[6424.53s -> 6425.53s]  This one.
[6425.57s -> 6431.01s]  Hey, I told you guys I did.
[6432.01s -> 6441.55s]  I think this mask in here has been worn down so raw that I'm getting hit with plastic just digging into my face.
[6442.55s -> 6443.73s]  I'm going to have to replace it.
[6444.73s -> 6448.14s]  Press it?
[6459.37s -> 6460.37s]  Might be a waste, but I don't care.
[6468.65s -> 6471.94s]  Brick.
[6472.94s -> 6476.93s]  Beginning with a brick, I gotta try.
[6477.93s -> 6480.70s]  Who bricks?
[6481.70s -> 6486.91s]  I can make fire on somebody's head.
[6487.91s -> 6490.56s]  Can I crush somebody's head?
[6491.56s -> 6492.56s]  Alex, are you alright?
[6492.60s -> 6493.60s]  I'm fine, Russell.
[6494.60s -> 6495.60s]  What's up?
[6496.60s -> 6499.18s]  I'm fine, I'll see you in a minute.
[6500.18s -> 6503.66s]  Just get me a large.
[6504.66s -> 6505.66s]  Get me a large steak and cheese.
[6510.30s -> 6511.30s]  What did I have to say that for?
[6512.30s -> 6513.30s]  Why did I say that?
[6515.43s -> 6516.43s]  Now I want a large steak and cheese.
[6517.43s -> 6518.43s]  Something so bad right now.
[6519.43s -> 6520.43s]  Why did I do that?
[6521.43s -> 6522.43s]  What the fuck is wrong with me?
[6537.05s -> 6538.05s]  That would hurt so much.
[6544.34s -> 6546.34s]  I'm ready to pancake somebody's head.
[6560.83s -> 6565.46s]  Alright.
[6565.50s -> 6568.47s]  Hello?
[6569.47s -> 6577.24s]  This is weird.
[6578.24s -> 6584.34s]  Ring the doorbell?
[6585.34s -> 6586.34s]  The Alex Vans.
[6587.34s -> 6588.34s]  I said Gorgon, I-
[6589.34s -> 6592.25s]  You see?
[6594.45s -> 6595.75s]  Did?
[6596.75s -> 6597.75s]  Come, enter.
[6598.75s -> 6602.36s]  Okay, thanks.
[6603.36s -> 6604.36s]  You are welcome.
[6605.36s -> 6606.36s]  So, what's that vortigaunt doing here?
[6607.86s -> 6608.86s]  Cooking.
[6609.86s -> 6610.86s]  Right, but I mean in general.
[6611.86s -> 6612.86s]  Okay.
[6612.90s -> 6613.90s]  I do too.
[6614.90s -> 6616.65s]  I'm sorry.
[6617.65s -> 6618.65s]  My brain is injured.
[6618.65s -> 6619.65s]  That's terrible and I hope-
[6620.65s -> 6622.95s]  Look, I'm actually pretty busy looking for my father.
[6623.95s -> 6624.95s]  The-
[6625.95s -> 6626.95s]  Eli Vans.
[6627.95s -> 6628.95s]  Yes.
[6629.95s -> 6631.95s]  The Combine have him and I really do need to get moving.
[6632.95s -> 6633.95s]  The Combine?
[6634.95s -> 6635.95s]  Yes, do not go yet.
[6636.95s -> 6637.95s]  I will show you something.
[6638.95s -> 6639.95s]  Look, I appreciate it.
[6640.95s -> 6641.95s]  This way.
[6641.95s -> 6642.95s]  I can't stick around.
[6642.99s -> 6643.99s]  Is this important?
[6644.99s -> 6645.99s]  I know, I'm sure it is.
[6646.99s -> 6648.99s]  The Alex Vans must go this way.
[6649.99s -> 6650.99s]  This way.
[6651.99s -> 6652.99s]  These guys are so cool.
[6663.58s -> 6664.58s]  I want some.
[6665.58s -> 6666.58s]  Oh, he's the one doing the spells.
[6667.58s -> 6670.03s]  Hold on, wait.
[6671.03s -> 6682.62s]  I'm missing lore.
[6683.62s -> 6702.04s]  The Combine and Alex Vans.
[6703.04s -> 6705.62s]  I would help.
[6706.62s -> 6711.62s]  I really would, but the Alex Vans is honestly very busy saving her dad.
[6712.99s -> 6713.99s]  I will not save him.
[6714.99s -> 6715.99s]  He is dead.
[6716.99s -> 6717.99s]  What?
[6717.99s -> 6718.99s]  Or he will be.
[6719.99s -> 6720.99s]  Is or will be?
[6721.99s -> 6722.99s]  It is a matter of perspective.
[6724.49s -> 6727.49s]  Alex Vans alone cannot prevent his fate.
[6728.49s -> 6729.49s]  I-
[6730.49s -> 6734.49s]  Look, thank you for everything, but I really have to go.
[6735.49s -> 6737.49s]  I'm sorry, but I really don't have time for riddles.
[6738.49s -> 6739.49s]  No riddles.
[6740.49s -> 6741.49s]  The Combine drilled here.
[6741.53s -> 6743.53s]  I am severed from the Vortessence.
[6744.53s -> 6746.96s]  I am alone in my head.
[6747.96s -> 6750.99s]  I'm sorry.
[6752.23s -> 6754.18s]  This is your war.
[6755.18s -> 6758.18s]  If I can, if I run across your friends, I will see what I can do.
[6759.18s -> 6761.74s]  You have saved my kin.
[6762.74s -> 6763.74s]  I haven't.
[6764.74s -> 6765.74s]  Then you will.
[6768.38s -> 6771.86s]  Venge Alex Vans.
[6772.86s -> 6775.38s]  Risen!
[6778.29s -> 6779.29s]  Risen, over here.
[6780.91s -> 6782.66s]  Oh no, I got-
[6782.70s -> 6783.70s]  You must go.
[6787.76s -> 6788.76s]  Risen?
[6790.51s -> 6792.51s]  You're baiting people with resin over here.
[6796.06s -> 6797.06s]  It's probably right there.
[6797.06s -> 6798.06s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[6798.06s -> 6799.06s]  I think I see some resin.
[6802.86s -> 6803.86s]  The mission begins.
[6804.86s -> 6805.86s]  They might be-
[6806.86s -> 6807.86s]  Calm down!
[6809.67s -> 6810.67s]  He's gonna suck it in the back of the head.
[6813.45s -> 6814.45s]  Whatever, I probably missed the resin.
[6817.22s -> 6818.22s]  I'm a fucking maniac.
[6819.22s -> 6820.22s]  Just go, Omega Well.
[6821.22s -> 6823.40s]  Tell me you didn't get baited from the resin over there.
[6824.40s -> 6831.08s]  Oh, he's the one doing this shit.
[6832.08s -> 6836.71s]  Oh!
[6837.71s -> 6838.71s]  I will help you.
[6839.71s -> 6841.71s]  Look to the northern star.
[6842.71s -> 6843.71s]  Why?
[6844.71s -> 6845.71s]  For guidance.
[6846.71s -> 6847.71s]  Okay, thanks.
[6848.71s -> 6849.71s]  Are you done helping?
[6850.71s -> 6852.27s]  I am not here.
[6853.27s -> 6854.96s]  Sustenance.
[6855.96s -> 6856.96s]  I'll eat it later.
[6857.96s -> 6858.96s]  Thanks for the help.
[6859.96s -> 6861.26s]  You'll be welcome.
[6862.26s -> 6863.26s]  Why is that such a big deal?
[6864.26s -> 6876.00s]  Eat those.
[6876.04s -> 6877.04s]  They're just protein and shit.
[6878.04s -> 6880.56s]  Why not just eat them?
[6882.06s -> 6884.06s]  I don't know, but test it for like, disease?
[6885.06s -> 6902.22s]  Let's go.
[6903.22s -> 6910.09s]  Why don't you just eat slugs?
[6911.09s -> 6920.08s]  Well, I would eat like slugs and bugs and shit if that was the only source of real food that was still around.
[6923.11s -> 6928.11s]  There's only so many cans of Chef Boyardee, ravioli, mini raviolis that exist.
[6928.11s -> 6931.11s]  Once those are gone, they're gone and then you have to deal with whatever the fuck you have to deal with.
[6933.11s -> 6935.06s]  Is it horrible?
[6935.06s -> 6939.56s]  Alex, the signal's back.
[6939.56s -> 6940.56s]  Can you hear me?
[6940.56s -> 6941.56s]  Are you okay?
[6941.56s -> 6942.56s]  Russell, I'm good.
[6942.56s -> 6943.56s]  How's Dad?
[6944.56s -> 6945.56s]  I've got him on the train.
[6945.56s -> 6946.56s]  He's on the move.
[6946.56s -> 6948.56s]  You've got to find Sea View Junction before they get there.
[6949.56s -> 6950.56s]  I'm working on it.
[6951.56s -> 6953.82s]  Why are these guys going to stand up?
[6954.82s -> 6963.10s]  No, come on.
[6963.10s -> 6964.10s]  I can't.
[6964.10s -> 6965.10s]  I don't want to say it.
[6966.28s -> 6967.28s]  I don't want to say it.
[6968.28s -> 6971.52s]  I found Yellow, the dead body, among us.
[6971.52s -> 6972.52s]  Like, I found him.
[6972.52s -> 6973.52s]  Who was it, right?
[6973.52s -> 6974.52s]  Like, come on.
[6974.56s -> 6975.56s]  I'm sorry.
[6975.56s -> 6976.56s]  Why?
[6976.56s -> 6977.56s]  I'm sorry.
[6978.80s -> 6979.80s]  I'm sorry.
[6979.80s -> 6980.80s]  It doesn't even make any sense.
[6980.80s -> 6981.80s]  Can I use this?
[6986.18s -> 6987.18s]  I'm like...
[6988.18s -> 6991.53s]  Oh, it's a hat.
[6997.25s -> 6998.25s]  Or the Half-Life door sound.
[6998.25s -> 7012.65s]  I'm not going to believe this, but I ran into a building.
[7014.65s -> 7015.65s]  It's in the heart.
[7015.65s -> 7016.65s]  In the heart.
[7020.65s -> 7021.65s]  These are the spiky ones.
[7021.69s -> 7023.69s]  That brings me more to that stuff.
[7031.33s -> 7037.18s]  Fuck!
[7037.18s -> 7052.75s]  Try to give up.
[7058.41s -> 7060.99s]  Get that off.
[7060.99s -> 7061.99s]  I just don't care.
[7061.99s -> 7062.99s]  I don't care if I miss.
[7063.99s -> 7064.99s]  I don't care if I miss, right?
[7064.99s -> 7065.99s]  Like, I don't care if I miss.
[7065.99s -> 7066.99s]  Stop caring and you'll get it.
[7066.99s -> 7067.99s]  Right?
[7067.99s -> 7068.99s]  No, I don't care.
[7068.99s -> 7069.99s]  I don't care if I miss.
[7069.99s -> 7073.66s]  I don't give a shit if I miss.
[7073.66s -> 7074.66s]  I'm going to go.
[7074.66s -> 7075.66s]  I'm going to keep moving.
[7075.66s -> 7076.66s]  I obviously can't shoot that guy.
[7076.66s -> 7077.66s]  I don't even care if I miss.
[7077.66s -> 7078.66s]  I don't care.
[7078.66s -> 7079.66s]  I don't care if I miss.
[7091.46s -> 7102.88s]  Fuck off.
[7102.88s -> 7103.88s]  Oh, electricity.

[7106.93s -> 7114.44s]  What was that?
[7118.50s -> 7119.50s]  Oh, it was just his shoes.
[7119.50s -> 7120.50s]  Never mind.
[7120.50s -> 7127.50s]  What's in here?
[7127.50s -> 7139.30s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[7139.30s -> 7140.30s]  Something in the barrel.
[7141.30s -> 7148.04s]  What is this?
[7148.04s -> 7159.07s]  What is that?
[7160.63s -> 7164.05s]  Mask on.
[7164.05s -> 7165.05s]  Where's the mask?
[7165.05s -> 7182.67s]  Where's the mask?
[7186.09s -> 7187.09s]  Russell, Russell.
[7187.09s -> 7188.09s]  I didn't eat it.
[7189.09s -> 7190.09s]  Right.
[7190.09s -> 7191.09s]  Of course you didn't.
[7191.09s -> 7194.65s]  I can check down there, but what is this guy holding?
[7194.65s -> 7202.93s]  Pressing.
[7205.51s -> 7207.51s]  Oh, that zombie has a shotgun.
[7207.51s -> 7208.51s]  What?
[7208.51s -> 7212.31s]  There's a shotgun in the game?
[7213.31s -> 7214.31s]  All right.
[7217.86s -> 7218.86s]  That's shit.
[7218.86s -> 7219.86s]  That's the only brick I had.
[7219.86s -> 7241.06s]  What do I do now?
[7241.06s -> 7242.06s]  I don't drop him?
[7242.06s -> 7245.03s]  N-A-A-M.
[7246.03s -> 7254.76s]  I'm shooting it.
[7255.76s -> 7259.28s]  Omega Low, you idiot.
[7267.30s -> 7268.30s]  I just like force walk to the ground.
[7269.30s -> 7272.08s]  Okay, hold on.
[7272.08s -> 7274.73s]  Okay.
[7274.73s -> 7286.46s]  Oh, it's a pulley system.
[7286.46s -> 7292.18s]  Launched.
[7292.18s -> 7293.18s]  Oh, all right.
[7293.18s -> 7296.34s]  There we go.
[7296.34s -> 7297.34s]  You hear that?
[7297.34s -> 7298.84s]  Yeah.
[7298.84s -> 7301.84s]  Let's get this shotgun and get out of here.
[7301.84s -> 7303.02s]  What's down there?
[7303.02s -> 7304.02s]  I don't...
[7304.02s -> 7305.02s]  What do you mean you hear that?
[7305.06s -> 7311.29s]  What are these?
[7312.29s -> 7313.53s]  What are these?
[7313.53s -> 7314.53s]  I don't know.
[7314.53s -> 7315.53s]  The bullets.
[7315.53s -> 7320.22s]  Give me the...
[7320.22s -> 7321.72s]  Oh, my God.
[7322.72s -> 7323.72s]  There's something coming through the door.
[7325.47s -> 7326.47s]  How do I get this shotgun?
[7335.54s -> 7336.54s]  Give me the shotgun, dude.
[7338.98s -> 7341.75s]  Let it go.
[7341.75s -> 7351.31s]  Oh, stop.
[7351.31s -> 7352.31s]  Where's the thing?
[7352.31s -> 7360.21s]  All right.
[7360.21s -> 7361.21s]  Stop it right there.
[7361.21s -> 7367.33s]  Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me,

[7368.89s -> 7373.39s]  Oh, yeah.
[7373.39s -> 7374.39s]  How do I open shotgun to load shells?
[7374.39s -> 7375.39s]  What?
[7375.39s -> 7380.86s]  Oh, shit.
[7380.90s -> 7382.90s]  Oh, shit.
[7383.90s -> 7385.90s]  Click controller to do that.
[7385.90s -> 7386.90s]  Okay.
[7386.90s -> 7389.04s]  I got the shotgun.
[7389.04s -> 7390.04s]  Oh, this...
[7390.04s -> 7391.04s]  What did I just throw?
[7394.65s -> 7405.10s]  Get out of here.
[7406.10s -> 7407.10s]  Okay.
[7407.10s -> 7408.10s]  Whoa.
[7408.10s -> 7413.18s]  We did it.
[7413.18s -> 7415.13s]  I lost this gun.
[7415.13s -> 7416.13s]  Last shell.
[7416.13s -> 7417.13s]  I'm out.
[7417.13s -> 7418.13s]  Last shell?
[7418.13s -> 7422.95s]  Fuck you.
[7422.95s -> 7426.05s]  Any more?
[7426.05s -> 7427.05s]  Bottom of a gamer?
[7427.05s -> 7428.05s]  Really, man?
[7428.05s -> 7429.42s]  Maybe?
[7429.42s -> 7443.39s]  I'm basically going to stand up.
[7443.39s -> 7444.39s]  I haven't gotten any resin either.
[7444.39s -> 7445.39s]  I'm so bad.
[7445.39s -> 7446.39s]  Such a bad player.
[7446.39s -> 7447.39s]  Stiff gamer.
[7447.43s -> 7473.06s]  Yeah, kind of.
[7474.06s -> 7475.06s]  What's over here?
[7476.06s -> 7489.07s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7489.07s -> 7490.07s]  There's something over here.
[7490.07s -> 7494.26s]  Oh!
[7495.26s -> 7496.26s]  I almost died.
[7496.26s -> 7499.29s]  Bottle or something.
[7500.29s -> 7507.80s]  Ow!
[7507.80s -> 7508.80s]  Oh!
[7508.80s -> 7518.66s]  Hell, yeah.
[7518.66s -> 7522.53s]  The headcrab.
[7522.53s -> 7524.98s]  Can I do that?
[7524.98s -> 7525.98s]  Wait.
[7525.98s -> 7528.06s]  Who wants a drink?
[7528.06s -> 7531.79s]  Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[7531.79s -> 7532.79s]  What does that do?
[7532.79s -> 7537.62s]  What does that do for me?
[7537.62s -> 7538.62s]  What did I do that for?
[7538.62s -> 7544.85s]  Look at the liquid of the bottle.
[7544.85s -> 7545.85s]  Look at the liquid.
[7545.85s -> 7556.88s]  Yeah, that's it.
[7556.88s -> 7557.88s]  I'm going to die.
[7557.92s -> 7562.55s]  Okay.
[7562.55s -> 7563.55s]  Let me ask you a question.
[7563.55s -> 7589.78s]  If you could eat this, if this was completely edible, but it stunk like rotten trash, but
[7589.78s -> 7603.83s]  it was like 25 grams of protein in like all your vitamins, like vitamin C, vitamin B,
[7603.83s -> 7606.83s]  vitamin A, all of them.
[7606.83s -> 7609.83s]  This was like six years worth of food.
[7609.83s -> 7616.83s]  If you eat this, or over here, on that pallet over here, is a stack of food.
[7616.83s -> 7624.14s]  If you eat this, or over here, on that pallet over here, is a stack of a year's worth of
[7624.14s -> 7626.14s]  Chef Boyardee mini raviolis.
[7626.14s -> 7629.70s]  And this is like stacked up to this height.
[7629.70s -> 7630.70s]  This is at least five years.
[7630.70s -> 7631.70s]  This is one year.
[7631.70s -> 7632.70s]  I would take that one.
[7632.70s -> 7638.10s]  I would take the short thing.
[7638.10s -> 7639.59s]  Coming in here.
[7639.59s -> 7640.59s]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[7640.59s -> 7660.39s]  What?
[7660.39s -> 7661.39s]  What?
[7661.39s -> 7669.10s]  How could there be nothing in a chest?
[7669.10s -> 7670.10s]  That's bullshit.
[7670.10s -> 7671.10s]  Wait!
[7671.10s -> 7700.54s]  I have a gas mask, right?
[7700.54s -> 7701.78s]  I did.
[7701.78s -> 7702.78s]  Oh shit.
[7702.78s -> 7704.22s]  Okay.
[7704.22s -> 7709.23s]  Oh shit.
[7709.23s -> 7713.10s]  Oh shit.
[7713.10s -> 7714.10s]  Oh shit.
[7714.10s -> 7715.10s]  Oh shit.
[7715.10s -> 7716.10s]  Okay.
[7716.10s -> 7717.10s]  We're not going to fuck around.
[7717.10s -> 7718.10s]  Wipe out!
[7718.10s -> 7723.94s]  Wasn't even the right guy!
[7723.94s -> 7726.14s]  Holy shit.
[7726.14s -> 7727.14s]  Okay.
[7727.14s -> 7730.30s]  Overkill?
[7730.30s -> 7742.68s]  Was it?
[7742.68s -> 7743.68s]  Wait, I need to.
[7743.68s -> 7747.86s]  I'm just going to...
[7747.86s -> 7753.52s]  Who holds a shotgun like this?
[7753.52s -> 7754.52s]  I need ammo.
[7754.52s -> 7755.52s]  Okay.
[7756.52s -> 7759.04s]  Okay.
[7759.04s -> 7763.35s]  Overkill?
[7763.35s -> 7764.35s]  Was it?
[7764.35s -> 7766.62s]  Wait, I need to.
[7766.62s -> 7770.10s]  I'm just going to...
[7770.10s -> 7771.10s]  Who holds a shotgun like this?
[7771.10s -> 7772.10s]  I need ammo.
[7772.10s -> 7773.10s]  Bad, dude.
[7773.10s -> 7778.43s]  It's not looking good.
[7778.43s -> 7779.43s]  Oh.
[7779.43s -> 7780.43s]  I need a resin.
[7780.43s -> 7781.43s]  There's a ladder over there.
[7781.43s -> 7792.51s]  Holy shit.
[7792.51s -> 7814.42s]  Did I kill him?
[7814.42s -> 7815.42s]  I almost have full health.
[7815.42s -> 7821.85s]  Go there.
[7821.85s -> 7827.31s]  These things again.
[7827.31s -> 7828.31s]  Okay.
[7828.31s -> 7843.50s]  Got it.
[7843.50s -> 7844.50s]  Oh, it's an upgrade station.
[7849.78s -> 7853.06s]  Oh.
[7853.06s -> 7856.54s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[7856.54s -> 7860.92s]  More resin.
[7860.92s -> 7861.92s]  Okay.
[7861.92s -> 7862.92s]  That's it.
[7862.92s -> 7863.92s]  Yeah, that's the one.
[7863.92s -> 7865.93s]  Look for more resin.
[7865.93s -> 7866.93s]  Okay.
[7866.93s -> 7872.58s]  Okay.
[7872.58s -> 7873.95s]  Okay.
[7873.95s -> 7874.95s]  Okay.
[7874.95s -> 7875.95s]  Okay.
[7875.95s -> 7876.95s]  Okay.
[7876.95s -> 7877.95s]  Okay.
[7877.95s -> 7878.95s]  Okay.
[7878.95s -> 7879.95s]  Okay.
[7879.95s -> 7880.95s]  Okay.
[7880.95s -> 7881.95s]  Okay.
[7881.95s -> 7882.95s]  Okay.
[7882.95s -> 7883.95s]  Okay.
[7883.95s -> 7884.95s]  Okay.
[7884.95s -> 7885.95s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[7885.95s -> 7886.95s]  More resin.
[7886.95s -> 7887.95s]  Okay.
[7887.95s -> 7888.95s]  I'll take an eye out.
[7888.95s -> 7889.95s]  Resin.
[7889.95s -> 7890.95s]  Yeah, that's the one.
[7890.95s -> 7891.95s]  Look for more resin.
[7891.95s -> 7892.95s]  Shit.
[7892.95s -> 7893.95s]  Come on.
[7893.95s -> 7896.09s]  There's got to be some resin.
[7896.09s -> 7897.09s]  Don't I have one of those?
[7897.09s -> 7898.09s]  Resin hiding under one of these, I guarantee it.
[7898.09s -> 7900.99s]  One of these.
[7900.99s -> 7901.99s]  Oh, yeah.
[7901.99s -> 7916.29s]  Resin, but I'll take the ammo.
[7916.29s -> 7917.29s]  I need it.
[7917.29s -> 7918.29s]  Okay.
[7918.29s -> 7922.02s]  Do I do the side or do I just hold it?
[7922.02s -> 7924.48s]  Do you need a...
[7924.48s -> 7925.66s]  Yes.
[7925.66s -> 7926.66s]  Okay.
[7926.66s -> 7928.98s]  Okay.
[7929.98s -> 7930.98s]  I'll take the ammo.
[7930.98s -> 7934.91s]  I need it.
[7934.91s -> 7935.91s]  Okay.
[7935.91s -> 7936.91s]  Do I do the side or do I just hold it?
[7936.91s -> 7937.91s]  Do you need a...
[7937.91s -> 7942.10s]  Yes, I would eat a headcrab.
[7942.10s -> 7945.10s]  If I had to, if I was like life or death, I'm not going to go like, oh, ew, gross, ew,
[7945.10s -> 7946.72s]  no, I don't want it.
[7946.72s -> 7949.72s]  Like, if I'm going to die, if I'm starving to death, I'm going to eat a headcrab.
[7949.72s -> 7950.72s]  Why wouldn't you?
[7950.72s -> 7951.72s]  Why are you so against doing that?
[7951.72s -> 7952.72s]  Ew, but I don't really need to.
[7952.72s -> 7953.72s]  I saved the resin.
[7953.72s -> 7955.34s]  I'm not going to use it.
[7955.34s -> 7957.74s]  What point?
[7957.74s -> 7958.74s]  The Easter egg.
[7958.74s -> 7965.48s]  I swear to God.
[7965.48s -> 7966.48s]  Okay.
[7966.48s -> 7978.73s]  Okay.
[7978.73s -> 7979.73s]  Okay.

[7997.78s -> 7998.78s]  Okay.
[7998.78s -> 7999.78s]  Where am I?
[7999.78s -> 8003.90s]  I'm somewhere in the house.
[8003.90s -> 8004.90s]  I don't know where I am.
[8004.90s -> 8009.14s]  Where am I?
[8009.14s -> 8010.14s]  At the shelf.
[8010.14s -> 8012.15s]  Okay.
[8012.15s -> 8014.15s]  That means I should be facing the right way now.
[8014.15s -> 8017.25s]  That's good.
[8017.25s -> 8021.94s]  Crack my fingers.
[8021.94s -> 8029.39s]  Ah, damn it.
[8029.39s -> 8036.58s]  They take three hits each.
[8036.58s -> 8037.58s]  Did I not catch that?
[8037.58s -> 8038.58s]  How?
[8038.58s -> 8044.75s]  I've been catching it all day.
[8044.75s -> 8045.75s]  Wait a minute.
[8045.75s -> 8046.75s]  Get closer.
[8046.75s -> 8047.75s]  I need 25, right?
[8047.75s -> 8051.62s]  All right.
[8051.62s -> 8055.93s]  That's good.
[8055.93s -> 8058.26s]  Where do I go?
[8059.26s -> 8067.54s]  Ban the counters.
[8067.54s -> 8068.54s]  All right.
[8068.54s -> 8076.62s]  Start banning them.
[8076.62s -> 8083.11s]  Start banning the counters.
[8083.11s -> 8084.11s]  They need to get like a five minute timeout.
[8084.11s -> 8086.31s]  Start banning those counters.
[8086.31s -> 8087.31s]  What did I miss?
[8087.31s -> 8093.22s]  Monster.
[8093.22s -> 8094.22s]  Fuck.
[8094.22s -> 8095.72s]  Here we go.
[8095.72s -> 8096.72s]  What about down there?
[8096.72s -> 8097.96s]  Ah!
[8097.96s -> 8098.96s]  Go to catch.
[8098.96s -> 8100.39s]  Oh shit.
[8100.39s -> 8101.39s]  Here we go.
[8101.39s -> 8102.39s]  You just threw a bullet.
[8102.39s -> 8103.70s]  Oh shit.
[8103.70s -> 8104.70s]  Oh shit.
[8104.70s -> 8105.70s]  Oh shit.
[8105.70s -> 8113.72s]  Oh shit.

[8176.57s -> 8177.57s]  Oh shit.
[8177.57s -> 8181.11s]  Here we go.
[8181.11s -> 8189.50s]  You just threw a bottle at me.
[8189.50s -> 8209.85s]  I just whipped a fucking glass bottle in my face.
[8209.85s -> 8211.85s]  I do appreciate this mechanic.
[8211.85s -> 8215.85s]  But like, well, it's actually really, really fun just to do it.
[8215.85s -> 8219.05s]  Works out pretty well.
[8219.05s -> 8224.23s]  Let's see if we can do anything.
[8224.23s -> 8228.71s]  At Krasity Field.
[8228.71s -> 8230.27s]  You're alive.
[8230.27s -> 8232.27s]  Oh, he's alive.
[8232.27s -> 8238.67s]  That kind of was scary for a second.
[8238.67s -> 8246.34s]  Can I go through that?
[8246.34s -> 8247.34s]  Doesn't look like it hurts.
[8247.34s -> 8254.98s]  Where does this go?
[8254.98s -> 8257.43s]  Okay.
[8257.43s -> 8261.49s]  Off.
[8261.49s -> 8274.03s]  That isn't how this has to go over here.
[8274.03s -> 8276.03s]  Oh, this one's off.
[8276.03s -> 8281.79s]  What the fucking floor?
[8281.79s -> 8294.27s]  Get on.
[8294.27s -> 8307.40s]  Okay.
[8307.40s -> 8308.40s]  Door is locked.
[8308.40s -> 8310.40s]  It's a locked door.
[8310.40s -> 8311.40s]  Curious.
[8311.40s -> 8314.41s]  It's a locked fucking door.
[8314.41s -> 8323.37s]  Don't get this one down.
[8323.37s -> 8325.37s]  Oh, we get the key.
[8325.37s -> 8336.02s]  With both hands.
[8336.02s -> 8339.88s]  Beep!
[8339.88s -> 8352.10s]  I knew there was going to be a guy.
[8352.10s -> 8353.10s]  Hey!
[8353.10s -> 8359.08s]  He's supposed to be dead.
[8359.08s -> 8360.08s]  Show penis.
[8360.08s -> 8364.15s]  That's literally the first thing I see.
[8364.15s -> 8367.10s]  Show penis.
[8367.10s -> 8369.53s]  Show your penis.
[8369.53s -> 8372.34s]  No!
[8372.34s -> 8375.10s]  Why even say that?
[8375.10s -> 8377.10s]  It's never going to happen.
[8377.10s -> 8379.10s]  Why even write it?
[8379.10s -> 8382.62s]  It's just never fucking happening.
[8382.62s -> 8391.32s]  Show your penis.
[8391.32s -> 8393.32s]  I think that's probably the key.
[8393.32s -> 8395.32s]  Get collapsed on, so let me get this shotgun out.
[8395.32s -> 8397.32s]  Yeah, I'm going to get collapsed on.
[8397.32s -> 8399.32s]  I guarantee it.
[8399.32s -> 8401.32s]  Everything all right?
[8401.32s -> 8402.32s]  One good?
[8402.32s -> 8403.32s]  Good.
[8403.32s -> 8410.51s]  Okay.
[8410.51s -> 8411.51s]  Last four.
[8411.51s -> 8414.26s]  Two shells left.
[8414.26s -> 8415.63s]  Whoa.
[8415.63s -> 8422.08s]  You got to give me that back.
[8422.08s -> 8423.83s]  Okay, I'm ready.
[8423.83s -> 8425.83s]  I'm ready for whatever the fuck is supposed to happen.
[8425.83s -> 8428.20s]  I'm going to pick up the key and there's going to be ten people.
[8428.20s -> 8433.64s]  Look at how many shotgun shells.
[8433.64s -> 8434.64s]  Yeah, how they're setting.
[8434.64s -> 8438.22s]  This is like a boss fight.
[8438.22s -> 8439.22s]  That's a lot of ammo.
[8439.22s -> 8445.43s]  Okay, here we go.
[8445.43s -> 8454.90s]  Flashlight and gravity glove.
[8454.90s -> 8473.21s]  Oh, thank God.
[8473.21s -> 8475.21s]  Oh, shoot.
[8475.21s -> 8476.64s]  Okay, I'm ready.
[8476.64s -> 8479.90s]  Oh, no.
[8479.90s -> 8480.90s]  No, this became another game.
[8480.90s -> 8481.90s]  Oh, boy.
[8481.90s -> 8482.90s]  Here we go.
[8482.90s -> 8499.12s]  I can see them.
[8499.12s -> 8501.12s]  I can see them.
[8501.12s -> 8514.53s]  Ah.
[8514.53s -> 8515.53s]  Okay, close it up, please.
[8515.53s -> 8516.53s]  Thank you.
[8516.53s -> 8530.18s]  This is fine.
[8530.18s -> 8531.68s]  It's fine.
[8531.68s -> 8536.31s]  I hate this.
[8536.31s -> 8537.31s]  I hate this.
[8537.31s -> 8538.31s]  I hate this.
[8538.31s -> 8539.31s]  Yeah?
[8539.31s -> 8541.31s]  Can you just talk?
[8541.31s -> 8542.31s]  About what?
[8542.31s -> 8543.31s]  About anything.
[8543.31s -> 8544.31s]  Literally anything.
[8544.31s -> 8545.31s]  Oh.
[8545.31s -> 8546.31s]  Oh, this hand.
[8546.31s -> 8547.31s]  Oh, yeah.
[8547.31s -> 8548.31s]  So, when you're in a situation
[8548.31s -> 8550.31s]  your irrational fear of the dark is actually quite appropriate.
[8550.31s -> 8552.31s]  You know, I can give you easily a hundred reasons to be terrified.
[8552.31s -> 8555.31s]  Okay, that was my fault.
[8555.31s -> 8556.31s]  I'll be more specific next time.
[8556.31s -> 8558.31s]  Everybody boo.
[8558.31s -> 8561.13s]  Love it after we get real funny glass break joke.
[8561.13s -> 8563.13s]  I still got it.
[8563.13s -> 8571.64s]  Big fan of this flashlight.
[8571.64s -> 8574.64s]  And it's not unlike yourself is also sensitive to the dark.
[8574.64s -> 8575.64s]  Oh, yeah?
[8575.64s -> 8578.64s]  Meaning it should go on automatically when the lights go out.
[8578.64s -> 8580.64s]  Oh, how do I turn it off when the lights are on?
[8580.64s -> 8581.64s]  Yes.
[8581.64s -> 8586.70s]  How do I turn it off?
[8586.70s -> 8593.42s]  What am I swapping out here for?
[8593.42s -> 8594.91s]  I thought I was pooping.
[8594.91s -> 8595.91s]  Oiling yourself.
[8595.91s -> 8598.82s]  Yup.
[8598.82s -> 8603.13s]  Off.
[8603.13s -> 8604.13s]  What is going on?
[8604.13s -> 8609.40s]  Dude.
[8609.40s -> 8611.40s]  I just didn't know.
[8611.40s -> 8616.86s]  Aha.
[8616.86s -> 8619.68s]  It resonated behind me.
[8619.68s -> 8621.30s]  Hot gun shells.
[8621.30s -> 8622.54s]  No.
[8622.54s -> 8623.54s]  Well, fell on the ground.
[8623.54s -> 8630.20s]  Okay, does it matter what shoulder?
[8630.20s -> 8633.81s]  Like I keep messing that up somehow.
[8633.81s -> 8644.47s]  Back up to the electricity thing.
[8644.47s -> 8647.80s]  That's the door that was locked.
[8647.80s -> 8650.38s]  Did I get a key or anything?
[8650.38s -> 8670.29s]  I got a flashlight.
[8670.29s -> 8704.08s]  Is it making him uncomfortable?
[8704.08s -> 8706.70s]  I mean, ignoring them?
[8706.70s -> 8712.33s]  Well, yeah, I'm trying to pick through, like, look at his dick comments to see if anybody has an answer.
[8712.33s -> 8725.41s]  Okay.
[8725.41s -> 8727.03s]  Going back out.
[8727.03s -> 8736.66s]  Wrong way.
[8736.66s -> 8742.74s]  Back in the dark tunnel?
[8742.74s -> 8754.32s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[8754.32s -> 8758.74s]  I was going the wrong way?
[8758.74s -> 8759.74s]  Wrong way.
[8759.74s -> 8760.74s]  You fucking idiot.
[8760.74s -> 8762.68s]  Oh, please.
[8762.68s -> 8764.68s]  Nobody mentioned your dick.
[8764.68s -> 8766.68s]  It's all anybody's saying.
[8766.68s -> 8769.68s]  It's like the only thing being said.
[8769.68s -> 8777.86s]  Am I going the right way?
[8777.86s -> 8782.08s]  I'm going the right way, right?
[8782.08s -> 8793.73s]  No, the taser's not going to work.
[8793.73s -> 8794.73s]  Yeah, I'm going the right way.
[8794.73s -> 8808.55s]  I got jumpscared.
[8811.05s -> 8819.78s]  Hey.
[8819.78s -> 8822.78s]  No, no, no.
[8822.78s -> 8825.37s]  You're fine.
[8825.37s -> 8827.37s]  Get it off your face, Alex.
[8827.37s -> 8829.31s]  Get it off my face.
[8829.31s -> 8844.89s]  I'm fine.
[8844.89s -> 8845.89s]  I'm fine.
[8845.89s -> 8846.89s]  I'm fine.
[8846.89s -> 8849.09s]  I'm fine.
[8849.09s -> 8850.09s]  I got two hearts.
[8850.09s -> 8852.10s]  I'm good.
[8852.10s -> 8861.63s]  I don't even think about it, you little shit.
[8861.63s -> 8863.63s]  That's where I got to go, but wait.
[8863.63s -> 8864.63s]  Ammo.
[8864.63s -> 8869.07s]  Both?
[8869.07s -> 8871.50s]  Let me just check.
[8871.50s -> 8875.60s]  That's why you check.
[8875.60s -> 8888.34s]  Why you check.
[8888.34s -> 8891.82s]  Guys.
[8891.82s -> 8892.82s]  You want an ammo?
[8892.82s -> 8893.82s]  830?
[8893.82s -> 8898.77s]  I got enough.
[8898.77s -> 8899.77s]  All right, rest.
[8899.77s -> 8901.77s]  Oh, yeah.
[8901.77s -> 8902.77s]  Absolutely.
[8902.77s -> 8905.42s]  Before.
[8905.42s -> 8907.42s]  What was life like before the combine?
[8907.42s -> 8908.42s]  Ah, excellent.
[8908.42s -> 8912.06s]  Have a club sandwich.
[8912.06s -> 8913.06s]  Uh, nope.
[8913.06s -> 8914.06s]  Not once.
[8914.06s -> 8915.06s]  Right.
[8915.06s -> 8917.06s]  To make a club sandwich, you need to start with bread.
[8917.06s -> 8918.06s]  Not from a bread line.
[8918.06s -> 8920.06s]  From a bakery across the street.
[8920.06s -> 8922.06s]  I actually would rather you talk about something else completely.
[8922.06s -> 8924.06s]  You had tomatoes, lettuce.
[8924.06s -> 8928.06s]  We've been eating fucking soup out of a can in the last five years.
[8928.06s -> 8929.06s]  I don't want to hear about this.
[8929.06s -> 8930.06s]  Tell me about something else.
[8930.06s -> 8931.06s]  You toast the bread.
[8931.06s -> 8932.06s]  And you put all that in.
[8932.06s -> 8933.06s]  You're making me want to turn the stream off.
[8933.06s -> 8934.06s]  You guys have all that.
[8934.06s -> 8935.06s]  I want one of those now.
[8935.06s -> 8936.06s]  That's insane.
[8936.06s -> 8937.06s]  It is.
[8937.06s -> 8941.22s]  And I'm not on top of the first one.
[8941.22s -> 8942.22s]  You put ham in it.
[8942.22s -> 8943.22s]  Also from a pig.
[8943.22s -> 8945.22s]  And turkey from an animal we used to call.
[8945.22s -> 8946.22s]  Back up.
[8946.22s -> 8947.22s]  Back the fuck up.
[8947.22s -> 8948.22s]  And more tomato.
[8948.22s -> 8949.22s]  I can't back up.
[8949.22s -> 8951.22s]  And one of the other things I'm forgetting.
[8951.22s -> 8956.02s]  It was six inches tall and weighed up to continents.
[8956.02s -> 8959.02s]  It was the most impossible food item you could imagine.
[8959.02s -> 8961.02s]  In any age before ours.
[8961.02s -> 8962.65s]  Shit.
[8962.65s -> 8963.65s]  Wow.
[8963.65s -> 8964.65s]  I know, right?
[8964.65s -> 8965.65s]  That is.
[8965.65s -> 8966.65s]  Wow.
[8966.65s -> 8967.65s]  Okay.
[8967.65s -> 8968.65s]  Okay.
[8968.65s -> 8969.65s]  Thanks, man.
[8969.65s -> 8970.65s]  You're welcome, Alex.
[8970.65s -> 8972.46s]  In.
[8972.46s -> 8978.18s]  Thank you.
[8978.18s -> 8989.47s]  Else.
[8989.47s -> 8990.47s]  We're good.
[8990.47s -> 8991.97s]  After that fucking thing.
[8991.97s -> 8992.97s]  Okay.
[8992.97s -> 8994.72s]  This is going to be weird.
[8994.72s -> 8995.72s]  I need to pull this out.
[8995.72s -> 8996.72s]  Hey, get over there, dude.
[8996.72s -> 9007.82s]  Just get over there.
[9007.82s -> 9008.82s]  Get this over there.
[9008.82s -> 9009.82s]  What happened?
[9009.82s -> 9012.02s]  What did I just do?
[9012.02s -> 9013.02s]  What did I just do?
[9013.02s -> 9014.70s]  It's too dark.
[9014.70s -> 9019.98s]  Where's the thing?
[9019.98s -> 9020.98s]  What happened to the healing thing?
[9020.98s -> 9021.98s]  Where did it go?
[9021.98s -> 9022.98s]  Oh.
[9022.98s -> 9026.52s]  It's a.
[9026.52s -> 9032.82s]  It's a box down.
[9032.82s -> 9033.82s]  Give me it.
[9033.82s -> 9038.83s]  Watch out.
[9038.83s -> 9040.07s]  Watch out.
[9040.07s -> 9041.07s]  He's going to get you.
[9041.07s -> 9042.07s]  Back up.
[9042.07s -> 9044.59s]  Back up.
[9044.59s -> 9045.59s]  Do it.
[9045.59s -> 9054.90s]  Do it.
[9054.90s -> 9055.90s]  Do it.
[9055.90s -> 9059.31s]  Do it.
[9059.31s -> 9069.26s]  Do it.
[9069.26s -> 9070.26s]  Do it.
[9070.26s -> 9072.71s]  Do it.
[9072.71s -> 9075.87s]  Do it.
[9075.87s -> 9076.87s]  Do it.
[9076.87s -> 9077.87s]  Do it.
[9077.87s -> 9078.87s]  Do it.
[9078.87s -> 9082.86s]  Do it.
[9082.86s -> 9089.61s]  Get out of there.
[9089.61s -> 9090.61s]  Get out of there.
[9090.61s -> 9096.07s]  Go.
[9096.07s -> 9097.07s]  Get out of here.
[9097.07s -> 9098.07s]  Get out of here.
[9098.07s -> 9104.56s]  Get out of here.
[9104.56s -> 9105.56s]  Get out of here.
[9105.56s -> 9108.72s]  Go.
[9108.72s -> 9119.05s]  Go.
[9119.05s -> 9120.05s]  Go.
[9120.05s -> 9122.70s]  Go.
[9122.70s -> 9123.70s]  Go.
[9123.70s -> 9125.45s]  Oh my God.
[9125.45s -> 9126.45s]  Oh my God.
[9126.45s -> 9127.88s]  Oh my God.
[9127.88s -> 9130.98s]  Oh my God.
[9130.98s -> 9134.33s]  Oh my God.
[9134.33s -> 9135.33s]  What is he?
[9135.33s -> 9136.33s]  He's inside of my desk.
[9136.33s -> 9143.14s]  Sicken.
[9143.14s -> 9148.98s]  He's in a sicken.
[9148.98s -> 9149.98s]  Where's the.
[9149.98s -> 9153.14s]  Exploder.
[9153.14s -> 9154.14s]  Holy shit.
[9154.14s -> 9155.14s]  Is he dead?
[9155.14s -> 9156.14s]  Let me do that.
[9156.14s -> 9160.46s]  I ain't even scared as shit.
[9160.46s -> 9161.46s]  Wilhelm scream?
[9161.46s -> 9166.32s]  That was not a Wilhelm scream.
[9166.32s -> 9170.33s]  What was it?
[9170.33s -> 9171.89s]  I did the Wilhelm scream?
[9171.89s -> 9174.98s]  Get off of me.
[9174.98s -> 9175.98s]  Get off of me.
[9175.98s -> 9180.23s]  It was?
[9180.23s -> 9184.74s]  Maybe.
[9184.74s -> 9186.94s]  Nerve-racking, man.
[9186.94s -> 9187.94s]  This is scary shit.
[9187.94s -> 9188.94s]  I thought this was an ammo.
[9188.94s -> 9195.42s]  Really?
[9195.42s -> 9196.42s]  Uh-huh.
[9196.42s -> 9197.42s]  One thing I don't...
[9197.42s -> 9207.50s]  Why?
[9207.50s -> 9222.10s]  I have to scratch the very part of my back that I cannot reach to put that in my backpack.
[9222.10s -> 9235.94s]  What does it even do?
[9235.94s -> 9239.40s]  I only have one of these?
[9240.82s -> 9241.82s]  Oh, shit.
[9241.82s -> 9244.22s]  I can only hold one.
[9244.22s -> 9245.22s]  Can I hold it in the other hand?
[9245.22s -> 9246.90s]  We're good.
[9246.90s -> 9253.46s]  Here it is.
[9253.46s -> 9262.57s]  Fuck.
[9262.57s -> 9266.70s]  Ah, there's another one of these rooms with a bunch of shit in it.
[9266.70s -> 9276.47s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[9276.47s -> 9277.47s]  Okay.
[9277.47s -> 9284.15s]  I'll take a shotgun, please.
[9284.15s -> 9285.15s]  Okay.
[9285.15s -> 9286.71s]  Okay.
[9286.71s -> 9291.98s]  Okay.
[9291.98s -> 9293.61s]  Okay.
[9293.61s -> 9338.11s]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[9338.11s -> 9343.11s]  This is how I got here, you son of a bitch.
[9343.11s -> 9352.03s]  There's...
[9352.19s -> 9360.88s]  Everybody's running!
[9360.88s -> 9366.74s]  This is true terror.
[9366.74s -> 9367.74s]  Okay.
[9367.74s -> 9373.22s]  ER is too much, man.
[9373.22s -> 9377.04s]  No, no, no, it's too much.
[9377.04s -> 9384.57s]  Okay, I've like been bumping into walls and screaming.
[9384.57s -> 9387.81s]  They're shooting at me, smash!
[9387.81s -> 9389.81s]  Oh my God, boom!
[9389.81s -> 9393.81s]  If you're like a neighbor, I'm being attacked in here.
[9393.81s -> 9397.30s]  Like, I'm being physically fucking assaulted in here.
[9397.30s -> 9399.80s]  There's a fight going on in here.
[9399.96s -> 9407.87s]  Especially if you have this playing through speakers, too.
[9407.87s -> 9411.05s]  Like, let's say there's like two or three buddies in the room and like you're hearing
[9411.05s -> 9414.05s]  like glass breaking and like explosions and stuff.
[9414.05s -> 9417.05s]  Wouldn't you be like, holy shit, what the fuck is happening over there?
[9417.05s -> 9420.46s]  Oh shoot, this?
[9420.46s -> 9421.46s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[9421.46s -> 9422.46s]  I'm gonna take this...
[9422.46s -> 9433.13s]  Let's check for resin, now that we can calm down.
[9433.13s -> 9442.62s]  I don't see anything.
[9442.62s -> 9445.62s]  I'm not gonna freak out this time.
[9445.62s -> 9453.15s]  They've given it to me for a reason.
[9453.15s -> 9474.64s]  Okay, what's that?
[9474.64s -> 9475.64s]  What's this?
[9475.64s -> 9476.64s]  Relax song?
[9476.80s -> 9477.80s]  Oh my God!
[9477.80s -> 9480.38s]  Run, run, run!
[9480.38s -> 9481.38s]  It was the same energy.
[9481.38s -> 9488.49s]  Give me this thing!
[9488.49s -> 9516.74s]  Oh shit, chapter complete!
[9516.74s -> 9533.61s]  Sucks but the video is kind of cool.
[9533.61s -> 9543.10s]  True?
[9543.10s -> 9547.54s]  I haven't heard that song in a very very long time.
[9547.54s -> 9551.02s]  What do we got?
[9551.02s -> 9552.90s]  What do we got?
[9552.90s -> 9553.90s]  I was just looking for resin.
[9553.90s -> 9560.54s]  When you're looking for it, you got it.
[9560.54s -> 9566.13s]  Okay, bad?
[9566.13s -> 9567.13s]  Breakable blocks?
[9567.13s -> 9568.13s]  Resin in here?
[9568.13s -> 9572.97s]  I know me, aren't you?
[9572.97s -> 9575.94s]  Flashlight?
[9575.94s -> 9579.58s]  Wait, is that a dead combine soldier?
[9579.58s -> 9585.22s]  Yeah, that is a dead combine soldier.
[9585.22s -> 9587.22s]  When you guys were off to do the reactor, I saw the combine leaving some ties in here.
[9587.22s -> 9589.22s]  So, I guess they're interested in this place again.
[9589.22s -> 9591.22s]  Right, well keep an eye out. Something's definitely up.
[9591.22s -> 9593.22s]  I didn't want him to get up.
[9593.22s -> 9595.22s]  I didn't want him to get up. He's a fucking bad guy.
[9595.22s -> 9597.22s]  What the hell is that?
[9597.22s -> 9602.72s]  Oh my god, what did I do about it?
[9602.72s -> 9611.36s]  Oh my god, it's a dead combine soldier.
[9611.36s -> 9613.36s]  I didn't want him to get up.
[9613.36s -> 9627.44s]  I didn't want him to get up.
[9627.44s -> 9630.26s]  I didn't want him to get up.
[9630.26s -> 9632.26s]  I didn't want him to get up.
[9632.26s -> 9634.26s]  Oh my god, it's a big...
[9637.65s -> 9643.28s]  I'm gonna fly your drone inside in the hallway.
[9643.28s -> 9652.50s]  I hear a little...
[9652.50s -> 9655.63s]  I hear a guy.
[9655.63s -> 9673.94s]  I hear a...
[9673.94s -> 9678.22s]  You guys hear it, right?
[9678.22s -> 9680.22s]  You can always tell when a combine's around because they sound kind of like a pig relaxing.
[9680.22s -> 9700.45s]  Okay, so...
[9700.45s -> 9702.45s]  Right now, what it's like to live on Earth on a scale of one to ten.
[9702.45s -> 9704.45s]  What it's like to live on Earth on a scale of one to ten.
[9704.45s -> 9706.45s]  What it's like to live on Earth on a scale of one to ten.
[9706.45s -> 9710.35s]  I'd say right at two.
[9710.35s -> 9712.35s]  What would you rate it before the combine showed up?
[9712.35s -> 9714.35s]  Ooh, that's a toughie. I don't know.
[9714.35s -> 9716.35s]  What the fuck was that?
[9716.35s -> 9718.35s]  Good day, I'd say six.
[9718.35s -> 9720.35s]  Do I have any healing?
[9720.35s -> 9722.35s]  Six? That's not great.
[9722.35s -> 9724.35s]  Well, that's life, Alex. You know, it's not always great.
[9724.35s -> 9726.35s]  Well, maybe we get the combine offer.
[9726.35s -> 9728.35s]  Oh, here we go.
[9728.35s -> 9730.35s]  Get up.
[9730.35s -> 9732.35s]  Ooh, an eight. Yeah, that really would be nice.
[9732.35s -> 9734.35s]  I'm gonna go yellow to yellow.
[9734.35s -> 9739.41s]  I don't...
[9739.41s -> 9744.59s]  I just have to remember where they are.
[9744.59s -> 9746.59s]  This is green. Green to green.
[9746.59s -> 9749.41s]  Red.
[9749.41s -> 9757.98s]  Okay, red to red.
[9757.98s -> 9764.37s]  Over here. Nope.
[9764.37s -> 9766.37s]  I don't know. Purple. Green. No.
[9766.37s -> 9772.26s]  There's just green over here.
[9772.26s -> 9786.83s]  You know, purple.
[9786.83s -> 9789.65s]  Invisual lockers.
[9789.65s -> 9794.70s]  Probably going to be a thing. Yes, there is.
[9794.70s -> 9796.70s]  Something is stomping around upstairs.
[9796.70s -> 9798.70s]  I seriously don't know what it is.
[9798.70s -> 9809.39s]  Resid.
[9809.39s -> 9815.20s]  That thing.
[9815.20s -> 9834.13s]  How do I use this? Empty?
[9834.13s -> 9841.74s]  That's it. There's the guy making the noise.
[9841.74s -> 9853.20s]  Hear that shit?
[9853.20s -> 9856.02s]  Fucking chest. Box.
[9856.02s -> 9858.32s]  Fucking box.
[9858.32s -> 9860.32s]  Fucking box. Hold on.
[9860.32s -> 9865.31s]  Yeah, guess what?
[9865.31s -> 9867.31s]  There ain't gonna be shit in here.
[9867.31s -> 9869.31s]  It's gonna be empty. Ready?
[9869.31s -> 9871.31s]  Okay, if this chest is empty,
[9871.31s -> 9873.31s]  I get 100 subs.
[9873.31s -> 9876.19s]  If this chest is full of stuff,
[9876.19s -> 9878.19s]  I'm gonna shout out your name. That's right, you.
[9878.19s -> 9880.19s]  I'm gonna shout your name out in the chat room.
[9880.19s -> 9890.50s]  My fucking arm.
[9890.50s -> 9895.36s]  That really hurt.
[9895.36s -> 9897.36s]  Really, really hurt.
[9897.36s -> 9903.76s]  I look like I'm bleeding, am I?
[9903.76s -> 9907.41s]  Okay.
[9907.41s -> 9910.29s]  It's full of stuff.
[9910.29s -> 9912.29s]  Sawdust bunnies. Got a shout out for you.
[9912.29s -> 9914.98s]  Hey, Russian space fruit.
[9914.98s -> 9916.98s]  Got a shout out for you too.
[9916.98s -> 9921.07s]  Hey, Funder Dunder.
[9921.07s -> 9923.07s]  I'm talking to you.
[9923.07s -> 9925.76s]  You and me. We're friends.
[9925.76s -> 9927.76s]  Hey, the My SQ. You and me.
[9927.76s -> 9931.34s]  We're best friends.
[9931.34s -> 9933.34s]  Don't shout me out. James. W.
[9933.34s -> 9936.29s]  Hey, the train doctor.
[9936.29s -> 9939.49s]  Alright, very close.
[9939.49s -> 9942.18s]  Hey, Les Manda.
[9942.18s -> 9944.93s]  Hey,
[9944.93s -> 9950.56s]  I'm talking to you.
[9950.56s -> 9952.56s]  Hey, Ecalb99.
[9952.56s -> 9956.46s]  Suck.
[9956.46s -> 9958.46s]  Alright, that's enough.
[9958.46s -> 9967.26s]  What is this? Television?
[9967.26s -> 9971.55s]  What about me? Hey, Yellow.
[9971.55s -> 9973.55s]  Me, me, me. Okay, one more.
[9973.55s -> 9976.11s]  Lemon, the lemon guy.
[9976.11s -> 9978.80s]  Alright, we'll do five more.
[9978.80s -> 9981.04s]  Hey, Jabe. Hey, Goat Boy.
[9981.04s -> 9983.04s]  Hey, Navy Bog.
[9983.04s -> 9985.04s]  Hey,
[9985.04s -> 9987.79s]  Daisy Day.
[9987.79s -> 9991.12s]  Hey, Believe Blood.
[9991.12s -> 9993.12s]  Hey, Axolotl Inferno.
[9993.12s -> 9996.77s]  I'm talking about you.
[9996.77s -> 9998.77s]  Hey, Squeezy Chips.
[9998.77s -> 10002.29s]  I'm done doing this.
[10002.29s -> 10004.29s]  This joke was over 15 seconds ago.
[10004.29s -> 10007.23s]  I'm gonna fucking
[10007.23s -> 10012.93s]  smash the computer.
[10012.93s -> 10016.83s]  Alright, let's head down here.
[10016.83s -> 10023.34s]  Oh, shit.
[10023.34s -> 10025.34s]  Hey.
[10025.34s -> 10027.34s]  Oh, shit.
[10027.34s -> 10030.80s]  Okay, he's dead.
[10030.80s -> 10051.20s]  He has a backpack?
[10051.20s -> 10059.90s]  He's gonna, I know
[10059.90s -> 10061.90s]  when he's gonna be alive. He's gonna be this one.
[10061.90s -> 10073.74s]  Alright, this, we're gonna go this way.
[10073.74s -> 10080.32s]  Oh, sub.
[10080.32s -> 10084.10s]  Wait, Vinny got a sub. Vinny got
[10084.10s -> 10088.96s]  a vinesauce sub.
[10088.96s -> 10090.96s]  Well, follow Vinny. I'm talking to you directly. Go follow Vinny
[10090.96s -> 10092.96s]  if you have any. He's fucking one of the best streamers on Twitch.
[10092.96s -> 10094.96s]  Vinesauce, go do it.
[10094.96s -> 10098.03s]  If at least half of you don't go follow Vinny
[10098.03s -> 10100.03s]  right now, I'm gonna turn the fucking stream
[10100.03s -> 10124.61s]  off. Is this liquid in here?
[10124.61s -> 10129.02s]  I thought, I always thought it was, propane was just
[10129.02s -> 10131.02s]  gas. Is this propane
[10131.02s -> 10133.02s]  or is this gasoline?
[10133.02s -> 10135.02s]  Gasoline doesn't explode, does it? When it comes into
[10135.02s -> 10137.02s]  contact with combustible material.
[10137.02s -> 10146.42s]  Yeah, no, gas doesn't
[10146.42s -> 10148.98s]  explode. Not the only light on fire,
[10148.98s -> 10150.98s]  but gasoline, like, unless
[10150.98s -> 10152.98s]  when it comes into contact with combustible material.
[10152.98s -> 10154.98s]  Combustible.
[10154.98s -> 10160.29s]  Not like, gas.
[10160.29s -> 10168.67s]  All right, here's my review for
[10168.67s -> 10170.67s]  Half-Life Alex so far.
[10170.67s -> 10173.17s]  Gunplay, nine.
[10173.17s -> 10175.79s]  Hori, nine.
[10175.79s -> 10178.22s]  Atmosphere, nine
[10178.22s -> 10181.17s]  point one. Put things in your
[10181.17s -> 10193.01s]  backpack. Average it
[10193.01s -> 10196.34s]  out, although that doesn't have
[10196.34s -> 10200.50s]  very much weight. What are you gonna
[10200.50s -> 10202.50s]  explode through here? Why do I have somebody else?
[10202.50s -> 10217.92s]  Oh, yeah, best VR game
[10217.92s -> 10219.92s]  ever. I don't know where to go, therefore it's a
[10219.92s -> 10221.92s]  bad game. I don't know where to go
[10221.92s -> 10223.92s]  right now, therefore it's not a good game.
[10223.92s -> 10233.31s]  True. Not true.
[10233.31s -> 10236.82s]  Stupid. Pull these
[10236.82s -> 10239.38s]  guys up. Oh, then I can go that
[10239.38s -> 10241.38s]  way. Here, explode.
[10241.38s -> 10246.74s]  Oh, true LMR.
[10246.74s -> 10252.05s]  It's great.
[10252.05s -> 10254.99s]  It's very, very good.
[10254.99s -> 10260.11s]  Oh, you can't get me.
[10260.11s -> 10262.80s]  You can't get me. That one you can't get me.
[10262.80s -> 10275.84s]  I need a shield.
[10275.84s -> 10291.33s]  Resin, please.
[10291.33s -> 10293.89s]  Flushed up can.
[10293.89s -> 10316.74s]  Dude, I like this song.
[10316.74s -> 10337.41s]  Oh, yeah.
[10337.41s -> 10357.44s]  It's like, like, racquetballs.
[10357.44s -> 10359.44s]  It's already playing squash back there.
[10359.44s -> 10379.14s]  Resin.
[10379.14s -> 10383.66s]  Oh.
[10383.66s -> 10387.74s]  Oh.
[10387.74s -> 10389.74s]  All right, I'm just gonna have to
[10389.74s -> 10391.74s]  just be crying. Like, ten people that
[10391.74s -> 10393.74s]  are gonna come into this room randomly, like, as they say,
[10393.74s -> 10395.74s]  oh, this guy's pulling out. I'm just gonna be crying. They're gonna be like,
[10395.74s -> 10409.82s]  oh, what's going on? I said,
[10409.82s -> 10413.86s]  I guess it's all right.
[10413.86s -> 10417.12s]  Oh, I don't want it.
[10417.12s -> 10419.12s]  Guys, stop. Leave me alone.
[10419.12s -> 10426.02s]  Fuck.
[10426.02s -> 10430.43s]  Shotgun show. Great.
[10430.43s -> 10432.43s]  And I'm done. I'm done for the month.
[10432.43s -> 10435.50s]  I'm fucking out of here, dude.
[10435.50s -> 10438.19s]  Dude, my game is
[10438.19s -> 10447.09s]  stupid.
[10447.09s -> 10449.09s]  Okay, fucking, oh my god, there's people here.
[10449.09s -> 10456.96s]  I know what you're gonna do.
[10456.96s -> 10458.96s]  I see, dude. I know what you're doing.

[13933.77s -> 13934.77s]  something big
[13934.77s -> 13935.77s]  something huge
[13935.77s -> 13937.77s]  they're here in the QC in some kind of vault but they're about to move it
[13937.77s -> 13939.52s]  where are we soon?
[13939.52s -> 13941.52s]  then we gotta steal it before they do
[13941.52s -> 13946.52s]  yes and look look I managed to pocket the combined data pod
[13946.52s -> 13949.52s]  if I can decrypt it we can figure out how to use their weapon against them
[13949.52s -> 13950.52s]  so what's the plan?
[13950.52s -> 13954.52s]  you head to the vault I'll take this thing back to Russell's and get to work

[13956.52s -> 13958.52s]  dad where's the vault?
[13958.52s -> 13961.52s]  look to the northern star
[13961.52s -> 13964.52s]  I guess look to the star got it dad
[13964.52s -> 13967.52s]  it's right in the middle of the QC and it's big
[13967.52s -> 13969.52s]  get up up around and see what you can find
[13969.52s -> 13975.98s]  I will accompany the alive and sure to save you

[13988.65s -> 13989.65s]  I love you too
[13989.65s -> 13990.65s]  the vortigaunts
[13990.65s -> 13991.65s]  thank you
[13991.65s -> 13994.65s]  the vortigaunts are good guys right?
[13994.65s -> 13996.65s]  they don't like the G-man
[13996.65s -> 14000.00s]  don't do it
[14000.00s -> 14002.37s]  you know you know it's available but don't do it
[14002.37s -> 14004.37s]  I never said I would tell them to stay
[14004.37s -> 14007.37s]  no no no no absolutely not
[14007.37s -> 14008.37s]  why would you do that?
[14008.37s -> 14011.37s]  oh they're the bad guys and G-man is the good guy
[14011.37s -> 14012.37s]  nobody knows
[14012.37s -> 14014.37s]  I'll let you know if he gets here
[14014.37s -> 14015.37s]  oh when?
[14015.37s -> 14017.37s]  when he gets here
[14017.37s -> 14026.33s]  that's the G-man
[14026.33s -> 14032.13s]  I mean they never like really made it clear
[14032.13s -> 14035.13s]  it was open to interpretation of what was even going on
[14035.13s -> 14040.12s]  I just you know I'm one of those people
[14040.12s -> 14043.12s]  I think G-man is Gordon Freeman without the goatee on
[14043.12s -> 14045.12s]  and it's like him like thousand years in the future or something
[14045.12s -> 14048.12s]  and going back and like well I'm in that camp
[14048.12s -> 14055.97s]  true true true yeah I know come on

[14141.70s -> 14142.70s]  that didn't open
[14142.70s -> 14143.70s]  alt over this

[14224.07s -> 14226.07s]  so much pressure in fact that I
[14226.07s -> 14230.42s]  while I hit you reached out for your father's hand
[14230.42s -> 14236.50s]  had his grip would have crushed all the delicate senses in the Russells
[14236.50s -> 14237.50s]  ah
[14237.50s -> 14238.50s]  okay
[14238.50s -> 14241.50s]  totally understandable and would have been worth it by the way
[14241.50s -> 14242.50s]  in this case
[14242.50s -> 14243.50s]  great
[14243.50s -> 14248.50s]  having said that I have a hard time imagining another situation where that would have been the case
[14248.50s -> 14249.50s]  I'm screaming I forgot sorry
[14249.50s -> 14252.50s]  and uh much like your father the Russells are priceless

[14461.22s -> 14464.58s]  this
[14464.58s -> 14467.74s]  okay let's go
[14467.74s -> 14489.37s]  authorized personnel only
[14489.37s -> 14493.18s]  is a key card of some sort that I don't have
[14493.18s -> 14497.86s]  terminal authority sure

[14553.45s -> 14565.82s]  this
[14565.82s -> 14571.29s]  I think it's the wrong door
[14571.29s -> 14591.66s]  oh this one
[14591.66s -> 14592.66s]  oh it's nothing
[14592.66s -> 14603.44s]  okay whatever
[14603.44s -> 14620.55s]  progress
[14620.55s -> 14625.95s]  it's alive
[14625.95s -> 14626.95s]  you
[14626.95s -> 14637.34s]  can't be serious
[14637.34s -> 14638.34s]  what?
[14638.34s -> 14639.34s]  dead?
[14639.34s -> 14640.34s]  well when it comes to
[14640.34s -> 14642.34s]  combined data encryption
[14642.34s -> 14643.34s]  yay
[14643.34s -> 14644.71s]  yay
[14644.71s -> 14645.71s]  it's robotic
[14645.71s -> 14646.71s]  it works
[14646.71s -> 14647.71s]  I can make short work of those
[14647.71s -> 14648.71s]  I feel like I'm trying to kill a cockroach
[14648.71s -> 14649.71s]  in my living room
[14649.71s -> 14652.42s]  might as well be an alien
[14652.42s -> 14657.95s]  it is an alien
[14657.95s -> 14658.95s]  god damn it man
[14658.95s -> 14672.93s]  wait for a resin
[14672.93s -> 14692.16s]  what makes you wish for a resin?
[14692.16s -> 14693.16s]  big brain resin
[14693.16s -> 14696.42s]  there's a combine over here
[14696.42s -> 14702.63s]  phone in prepared
[14702.63s -> 14703.63s]  fuck this
[14703.63s -> 14718.12s]  shit

[14730.79s -> 14732.35s]  what is that?
[14732.35s -> 14734.72s]  that's gotta be the vault
[14734.72s -> 14735.72s]  yeah
[14735.72s -> 14738.72s]  your dad didn't mention it was floating
[14738.72s -> 14741.72s]  so even if we make it there
[14741.72s -> 14742.72s]  we still have to get up to
[14742.72s -> 14744.72s]  this motherfucker is stealing all the neighbors internet
[14744.72s -> 14745.72s]  all the cables
[14745.72s -> 14746.72s]  look at all the cables attached to it
[14746.72s -> 14748.72s]  all we have to do is follow them
[14748.72s -> 14750.72s]  and break whatever's at the other end
[14750.72s -> 14751.72s]  and down comes the vault
[14751.72s -> 14752.72s]  simple
[14752.72s -> 14753.72s]  simple
[14753.72s -> 14755.72s]  yeah I like this plan
[14755.72s -> 14756.72s]  here
[14756.72s -> 14757.72s]  done
[14757.72s -> 14769.50s]  wait that's a key card
[14769.50s -> 14771.63s]  nice okay
[14771.63s -> 14773.63s]  do I still need this key card?
[14773.63s -> 14775.06s]  or can I
[14775.06s -> 14779.12s]  what about this key
[14779.12s -> 14781.12s]  do I get rid of this key card?
[14781.12s -> 14785.92s]  that's a lot of cables
[14785.92s -> 14788.18s]  is that?
[14788.18s -> 14789.18s]  what do I just throw?
[14789.18s -> 14791.00s]  no I want to
[14791.00s -> 14793.00s]  where'd the ammo go?
[14793.00s -> 14808.96s]  called the injector thing but I don't need it
[14808.96s -> 14811.99s]  I don't need this at all
[14811.99s -> 14812.99s]  I don't need this at all
[14812.99s -> 14814.68s]  take it for fun
[14814.68s -> 14822.68s]  that's a real kind of VR right?
[14822.68s -> 14832.50s]  you guys remember
[14832.50s -> 14837.50s]  some of you older viewers might remember the PSVR shit
[14837.50s -> 14839.50s]  do you guys remember when I was playing the Batman game
[14839.50s -> 14841.50s]  and the thing was so fucked up and so shitty
[14841.50s -> 14842.50s]  and the calibration was so wrong
[14842.50s -> 14846.50s]  that I could not reach my hand this far in front of me
[14846.50s -> 14848.50s]  I had to put a key into a safe
[14848.50s -> 14850.50s]  and I physically couldn't do it
[14850.50s -> 14855.38s]  I feel so nice to actually be able to do this
[14855.38s -> 14860.78s]  it's fun to do that
[14860.78s -> 14862.95s]  okay I got that key card let's go
[14862.95s -> 14869.29s]  that should be for the other door
[14869.29s -> 14871.87s]  healing watch it
[14871.87s -> 14875.01s]  they're gonna break this
[14875.01s -> 14877.95s]  I mean of course they're gonna break this
[14877.95s -> 14878.95s]  fuck you
[14878.95s -> 14890.67s]  fuck you dick

[14902.73s -> 14903.73s]  flip over right now
[14903.73s -> 14904.73s]  flip over
[14904.73s -> 14905.73s]  flip over
[14905.73s -> 14907.73s]  you flip over
[14907.73s -> 14909.90s]  drop it drop it drop it drop it
[14909.90s -> 14911.90s]  hey hey hey hey hey drop it what's he got

[14924.22s -> 14926.72s]  oh my god alright finally
[14926.72s -> 14932.39s]  have you heard any combine chatter about dad escaping?
[14932.39s -> 14933.39s]  no nothing
[14933.39s -> 14936.72s]  no that's not
[14936.72s -> 14937.72s]  on the plus side
[14937.72s -> 14939.72s]  that means dad is still on his way back home
[14939.72s -> 14940.72s]  okay

[17236.89s -> 17238.89s]  we were at a balcony and he
[17238.89s -> 17240.89s]  kind of looked over at me and he was like
