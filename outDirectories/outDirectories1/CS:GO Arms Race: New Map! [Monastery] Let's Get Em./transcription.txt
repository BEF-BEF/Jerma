[0.31s -> 12.94s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some live gun game.
[13.38s -> 18.42s]  This is actually on the newer map for gun games. Arms race, whatever you want to call it.
[19.10s -> 21.10s]  Come here you.
[21.10s -> 29.27s]  Come here. I'll get this guy. Bang! Get slotted. Come on, come on, come on.
[29.83s -> 34.96s]  What's up, dude? What's up, dude? Keep it going, keep it going, keep it going here.
[35.52s -> 40.05s]  Whoa, whoa!
[40.05s -> 44.33s]  What? How did I not kill that guy? Oh, that was a bunch of BS.
[44.93s -> 55.09s]  That was a bunch of HE double hockey sticks. Isaac Clarke has killed me. He spent time away from... Whoa, behind us.
[56.86s -> 63.48s]  Oh, that was lucky. Come on, come on, come on. I don't know anything about this map. Where, what, it's like a snow map?
[63.48s -> 72.38s]  What the hell is this place? Oh, damn it. I'm not that far behind. I can catch up. Like that. Come on.
[72.74s -> 78.83s]  Where you at? Oh, looks like they spawn over here, maybe? I don't even know.
[81.33s -> 92.45s]  Ooh, there it is. No, no, no. Oh, damn it. Come here. Oh,
[93.53s -> 96.52s]  God, I'm so bad. Oh, so bad. Oh,
[99.25s -> 105.72s]  Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? I gotta keep this going here. I could win this if I keep it up.
[106.00s -> 108.00s]  That's a teammate. Sorry.
[110.88s -> 122.84s]  Let's go back up here. No, come here you. Come here. Got an achievement too.
[123.20s -> 127.70s]  Hell-freaking-yeah. Top. Yeah, he's a guy.
[128.94s -> 140.18s]  I'm falling behind here. What? How is it even possible? I should have hit that guy right in his teeth. There we are.
[140.18s -> 144.35s]  Come on. I gotta string some together here. Get two, two, three in a row. Two, three, two, come on, come on, come on.
[144.59s -> 155.50s]  There's a guy right out here. Drop down. Nope. See up here. I'm so scared. I'm still in this. D'oh!
[157.34s -> 168.36s]  That guy got turned on big time right there. Oh, they spawn. Spawn. Where is he? I have no idea where that guy is. Oh,
[169.93s -> 180.86s]  shit. What? How the hell did you get up there, dude? Come on. Show yourself. Show yourself. Did he kill him? Oh my god.
[183.90s -> 197.01s]  I'm losing it now. All right. Try hard mode. Here we go. Oh, this guy's got 15.
[202.37s -> 212.08s]  I'm gonna scream. There it is. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Of course. Of course I run into the guy that said
[212.84s -> 229.14s]  invincibility. I'll give you invincibility. Gotta get that headshot. What's more have I got right now? 12 and 10. Yes.
[229.34s -> 242.57s]  That's a teammate. Don't want to shoot the teammate in the back. Oh, damn it. I'm going up top. I'm going up top here.
[242.57s -> 247.98s]  I will get a good vantage point up here. This guy right here is so dead. Wait, what? That's a shadow.
[249.82s -> 258.04s]  That's the guy's shadow I was gonna shoot at. If that guy turned around and killed me, I would have been so upset about that.
[259.24s -> 274.05s]  16, 21. Damn it. There we go. There it is. Come on. How many times have I said there it is?
[274.65s -> 289.50s]  Probably like 80. Is he right here? Where is he? Where? Oh, where? Top. This guy's gonna be on knife in a second here.
[291.61s -> 300.54s]  They're up on the roofs. The roofs. Such a bad gun to be doing that with. That was such a bad idea.
[300.54s -> 312.17s]  I gotta go up and under. Where? Where? On the roofs?
[313.33s -> 317.94s]  Everybody's on a roof.
[318.06s -> 337.14s]  We've got to catch up to this guy. Pick that guy off. This guy's gonna be on knife. It's alright. It's alright.
[337.30s -> 341.22s]  As long as that guy does not get a knife kill right now. That's the guy right there. There he is.
[341.46s -> 345.50s]  Don't get knifed. Don't get knifed, man. Don't get knifed.
[346.02s -> 349.28s]  Where? I keep...
[351.54s -> 374.08s]  He's through the door. Oh, we're gonna lose this I think. He's gonna get it right here. No.
[374.92s -> 386.11s]  Just don't get knifed. Yeah, that was him right there. That was the guy. Oh, I'm so lucky. Gotta get some more picks.
[386.11s -> 392.13s]  Oh, that was so...
[392.13s -> 399.89s]  That poor guy. I can still make this happen.
[405.46s -> 413.94s]  If that guy wasn't with me, I would not have killed him. Thank you, dude. Oh
[418.91s -> 425.75s]  No, he got it. That guy was 27 and 7. Oh my god.
[426.39s -> 431.90s]  Well, that's gonna wrap up the video guys. Thank you so much for watching. Really do appreciate it. Go check out this new map.
[431.90s -> 437.38s]  I believe there is another map as well, but it's not arms race. So go check out this new content dudes.
[437.38s -> 442.70s]  It's free, free download, and I'll see you guys all soon. And of course, take care everybody.
