[40.44s -> 51.43s]  Okay, see? I'm early. I'm early. I mean, I said I was going to be much earlier than this, but,
[51.43s -> 57.16s]  you know, take what we can get. Four minutes is fine. By the way, I looked over here,
[58.30s -> 60.78s]  and right when I pressed the go live button, I saw somebody say,
[61.75s -> 65.59s]  oh, like he farted or fart fart or something. And I was like, oh, what? Because I did.
[66.73s -> 72.41s]  Right before I pressed the button. I was like, how is it possible they could know that? But I forgot
[72.41s -> 79.70s]  that's like one of your guys' favorite words. So like, oh, of course, that somebody probably
[79.70s -> 87.62s]  writes the word farts in this chat, like once every, I mean, it's probably every like two or
[87.62s -> 99.85s]  300 words. So yeah, didn't catch me. Okay, hi. How's it going? Welcome to the stream.
[103.75s -> 112.09s]  Somebody said, great. Yeah, like, okay, great. Today, we're gonna look at him. Hmm. What are
[112.09s -> 124.84s]  we doing today? We're playing the logical journey of the Zoombinis. I played this game 30 years ago.
[125.99s -> 133.06s]  I also played this game about six or seven years ago. It's been a long time. It has been at least
[133.06s -> 144.84s]  five full years. Don't you feel old? 30 years ago? I mean, when did this come out? Okay.
[145.56s -> 167.66s]  Logical journey of the Zoombinis. This came out in 1996. That's 27 years ago. Yeah, 30 years ago.
[174.04s -> 183.16s]  People were question marking when I said 30 years. Hmm. Damn, you're old. Yeah, but we're
[183.16s -> 187.72s]  gonna play it. We're gonna get to my favorite part. If you don't know my favorite part,
[188.68s -> 196.42s]  it's the narrator. And it's when, you know, for all the new viewers, we'll let you experience it on
[196.42s -> 205.70s]  your own here. It's a puzzle game for kids. I seem to be on a trend here playing puzzle games for
[205.70s -> 217.30s]  children. I feel like I did that a lot. But yeah, let's go. It's a shame you don't have any brain
[217.30s -> 239.94s]  fluid. Wait, was this the brain fluid stream? It was. Okay. Yeah, it was. Here comes an embarrassment.
[240.50s -> 245.40s]  Well, the thing about the logical journey of the Zoombinis is you can change the difficulty to be
[245.40s -> 256.90s]  as easy or as hard as you want. You can make this game impossible. Okay, you know when you're in a
[256.90s -> 261.78s]  character creator, and you can just go to the hands, and you can make the hands just scaled
[261.78s -> 270.07s]  500 times. It's like, holy shit, that's kind of ridiculous. The Zoombinis you can you can scale
[270.07s -> 287.61s]  the difficulty up almost impossible. You'll see. So is this like Street Fighter? Dude, you're playing
[287.61s -> 297.37s]  a 30 year old game and not Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom. Hey, I'm the fart simulator
[297.37s -> 305.22s]  guy. I'm the fart simulator guy. I'm not the Zelda guy. Do you know what I'm saying? You got to do
[305.22s -> 321.88s]  what you know. All right, is Zoombinis some of the most important media? I'm kidding. All right,
[321.88s -> 333.94s]  let's go. Actually, yeah, it kind of is educational, fun, engaging. I think it was pretty formative.
[333.94s -> 349.83s]  All right, so we're going to watch the intro because I want you to see it. Here we go. All right. All
[349.91s -> 365.50s]  right. The intro is not clickable, so never mind. We're going to skip that part. Zoombini Island.
[365.50s -> 374.97s]  I can't watch the intro. Why? Don't skip. You hear me clicking up. I am clicking as fast as I can.
[374.97s -> 394.28s]  Will you play Left 4 Dead 2? Not right now. Watch the intro. I'm trying. I can't. All right, the
[394.28s -> 399.64s]  intro is just the Zoombinis need to find a new place to live, and they've picked an area that
[399.64s -> 406.98s]  they just need to traverse dangerous world to get to. We have to make our character. So the whole
[406.98s -> 411.46s]  point of Zoombinis is you have to make a bunch of Zoombinis, try to get them all. That's right,
[411.46s -> 424.76s]  I said all, not one, not two. All of them to survive to the end. So let's start. Okay, I'm
[424.76s -> 434.39s]  making this. I'm making that. And you could just make it all random too, which is probably what I...
[434.39s -> 443.54s]  Oh, they have names. Oh, I just randomized the entire group. All right, we've got a lot of
[444.50s -> 448.50s]  pink noses. And this matters, by the way. This is incredibly important.
[448.50s -> 455.94s]  He did it again when I did this last. I did this six years ago. I just programmed to do something
[455.94s -> 463.86s]  wrong. I did it the same. I did that already. Why am I programmed to do this wrong? All right,
[463.86s -> 482.10s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Can I go back? All right, how about we'll do half? Okay, we'll do half
[482.66s -> 488.02s]  randomly generated because it's fun to be because randomly generated. It needs to be this way.
[488.02s -> 507.93s]  I'll make three people. Why was more springs? We don't have any springs. What is going on here?
[512.22s -> 518.92s]  Uh, let's get a... How many... What do we have? A lot of green noses. Not a whole lot of blue noses.
[518.92s -> 530.23s]  Where's Gunu? That's a different universe. All right, I like that. We got a lot of pink shoes.
[530.23s -> 537.32s]  I don't know if I want more pink shoes. What do you guys think? I think we need more wheels.
[537.32s -> 548.50s]  No, what do we miss? What if we don't have a lot of blue shoes? Need more springs. Oh yeah,
[548.50s -> 556.49s]  we do need more springs. Spring, red nose, sunglasses. We have a lot of sunglasses. We don't
[556.49s -> 571.18s]  have very many of these eyes. Okay, only a few more. All right, another... Should we do a cyclops?
[571.18s -> 592.30s]  Okay, a lot of this ponytail here, these little guys edible. How does the game work? You will
[592.30s -> 601.83s]  see very shortly. Need another one of these. Yeah, let's do, uh, that green nose. Oh, that's it. All
[601.83s -> 632.65s]  right, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. It's all right. It's just it's old. It's an old
[632.65s -> 639.78s]  90s game where the cut scenes were dialed up times a thousand in audio. All right,
[640.50s -> 647.83s]  are we ready? I'm excited to play the logical journey of the Zumbinis. So we have two bridges
[647.83s -> 656.12s]  here. Probably asking, okay, the logical journey of the Zumbinis. We just across the bridge, right?
[656.12s -> 661.46s]  Let's go. Let's go ahead and do it. Let's go ahead and do it. Let's send somebody across the bridge.
[664.89s -> 676.97s]  Made it over safely. Safely. Okay, so let's deduce why that happened. Well, should I let you figure
[676.97s -> 686.97s]  it out? Let's find out. Okay, ready? Let's have somebody else go across. Okay, so there was a
[686.97s -> 699.02s]  problem there. I could not bring this guy over and the reason for that... This is not my face.
[699.02s -> 705.38s]  Why are you everyone saying Jerma? Jerma? All right, so this one made it across. What do you
[705.38s -> 708.58s]  think is wrong with this one? You think it's the different nose color because that's what you have
[708.58s -> 713.98s]  to figure out. Let's figure this out. All right, is it yellow noses are allowed to cross? Uh oh.
[714.94s -> 724.50s]  And by the way, they can die. Just so you understand, they can die. You get it? Do you
[724.50s -> 735.96s]  see what we're dealing with right now? Okay, is it... It's not the nose. So is it the hair?
[735.96s -> 739.72s]  Or is it the wheels? All right, do we have any other wheels? All right, wheels and a completely
[739.72s -> 747.10s]  different hairstyle. But the eyes are... All right, everything is completely different but the wheels.
[747.10s -> 758.84s]  If you have wheels, please go on the bottom bridge because that is what it is. Okay, so
[759.72s -> 771.32s]  what about springs? All right, people are gonna start dying. Uh, so springs... Can springs go up
[771.32s -> 780.86s]  here? Yeah, they have to be able to go through. Right, okay. All right, so they get a little
[780.86s -> 791.70s]  excited. Who couldn't make it? Okay, what about you? Yeah, you're fine. You're fine up there.
[791.70s -> 798.10s]  All right, you're fine up here. I think it's only based on the shoes but I don't know about those.
[798.10s -> 802.63s]  Let's just get everybody out. I think I'm just on the regular difficulty as well. You... I think
[802.63s -> 818.63s]  this can be much harder as well. As well, as well, as well, as well. All right. Settle down. All
[818.63s -> 829.03s]  right, it's time to... Like, what? It's all right. We got... All right, we got everybody.
[829.03s -> 833.21s]  Everybody has safely made it across and now they're all gonna go...
[835.99s -> 846.81s]  Watch. You've done quite well. Well, I did that sound so that's fine. Where's the Diablo 4 end
[846.81s -> 855.72s]  game stream? You don't want to hear my D4 thoughts. You don't want to hear how I feel about D4.
[855.72s -> 858.12s]  I don't think you... I don't think you want to hear how I feel about that game.
[862.30s -> 876.20s]  I don't think you want to hear it. These stone guards have their rules so do proceed with skill.
[876.20s -> 881.72s]  All right, this one is like the bridge but there's more... there's more places for error.
[887.74s -> 895.85s]  What did we do to deserve this? More of those little pebbles. Okay, so just like the bridge,
[896.81s -> 902.90s]  this one is also about letting people pass depending on like the shoes they have and the
[902.90s -> 911.78s]  hair they have. But as you see, there's multiple points of failure because if this rock is fine
[911.78s -> 922.22s]  and doesn't care, this one might care. So we have to deduce. Hey, it's logic, right? You're always
[922.22s -> 929.18s]  gonna start somewhere. We're going pink shoes. We're going straight in this way. All right,
[929.18s -> 939.90s]  not happy about that. So some people are probably gonna die here. I just want you to understand.
[941.08s -> 947.13s]  Okay, so something about this I'm gonna say. Let's go left side. You're cool with this. You are not
[947.13s -> 959.56s]  cool with that. Okay, so what is it? What is this? You've got red nose, pink shoes, glasses. All
[959.56s -> 967.10s]  right, maybe it's glasses. Is it the glasses that you don't like? Let's see. Okay, who's got glasses?
[967.10s -> 978.52s]  Excuse me. Okay, so it's the feet. Yeah, it's the feet. All right, so propellers cannot go this way.
[978.52s -> 988.58s]  So propellers have to go this way. Can the propellers go here? Is it based only on propeller
[988.58s -> 1005.96s]  for you too? Are you good? Okay, that's weird. All right, do we have pink shoes? Okay, this is based
[1005.96s -> 1017.22s]  on shoes. These. Okay, all right. So what about spring? You don't want spring. Do you care? You
[1018.02s -> 1028.86s]  both don't care. Nobody is going up here. Enjoy yourself. Speedrun the game? All right, what about
[1028.86s -> 1048.17s]  this way? Wheels? All right. Wrong way. Okay, with it this way. Oh, shit. Wait, what? Sorry. What is it?
[1048.17s -> 1062.42s]  Oh, so what is the problem? Have a good time. Have a good time. This process is pleasant.
[1062.42s -> 1072.30s]  Why are they doing this? Are you enjoying Final Fantasy 16 exclusively for the PS5 as a timed
[1072.30s -> 1081.51s]  exclusive? Yeah, I actually think it was fucking phenomenal. Okay, all right. What about blue shoes
[1081.51s -> 1087.98s]  this way? Welcome. I think we got it. So what was the problem? What does she just want? Anything?
[1087.98s -> 1102.97s]  Enjoy yourself. This is just practice. We're gonna do this again on hard and you'll see how
[1102.97s -> 1110.49s]  impossible the game is. Here's the best part of the whole game.
[1134.02s -> 1140.54s]  I used to sit here when I was younger and the reason why I thought this was my favorite part
[1140.54s -> 1149.74s]  of the game is because when you're younger, just making food. Oh, look, I made a, I made a jalapeno
[1149.74s -> 1157.70s]  and pepperoni pizza. I say, oh, okay. You get to like make stuff. All right, we got to go simple
[1157.70s -> 1167.58s]  though. Okay, well, let's see. All right, you have to, so we're going to play this again with the
[1167.58s -> 1171.42s]  other characters. Don't worry. I'm just, we're doing the tutorial. The tutorial is can we get
[1171.42s -> 1178.66s]  all 20 zoom beanies to the end on normal five-year-old difficulty. All right, so he doesn't
[1178.66s -> 1181.78s]  like it. He's something something on this. He doesn't like, so let's just try this. A regular
[1181.78s -> 1201.48s]  cheese pizza. Okay, you like the cheese, but he wants toppings. Okay, so what? Okay, something
[1201.48s -> 1216.18s]  maybe was it the, I don't know. Maybe just pineapple. All right, we got it. Pineapple and cheese
[1216.18s -> 1233.45s]  pizza. I would have said gross. I have absolutely fucking said that before. You got them all.
[1233.45s -> 1241.30s]  Play the harder difficulty. Yeah, I just, we're just doing the tutorial. I think we have to go
[1241.30s -> 1247.83s]  through it once. Eventually there are three different tree characters here and they're
[1247.83s -> 1266.04s]  very specific, but let's keep going. How many hours do you have in this game? I don't know.
[1266.12s -> 1278.89s]  Like four.
[1287.32s -> 1288.28s]  What the duck.
[1296.60s -> 1302.41s]  Right, so this game is kind of, let's turn the difficulty up. Why not? Let's go for it. Oh,
[1302.41s -> 1309.51s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not yet. If you don't have enough
[1309.51s -> 1316.74s]  zumbinis you have to have 16 if you don't have 16 you have to play the game
[1316.74s -> 1323.65s]  again but you have to get enough in the first three levels to be able to
[1323.65s -> 1334.25s]  continue on and we can go up or down too you have 16 yeah I know I'm just
[1334.25s -> 1337.25s]  showing you how it works you know when you do your full playthrough you'll
[1337.25s -> 1353.27s]  you'll see all right up or down I forget I forget what direction is easier go
[1353.27s -> 1366.60s]  down down is better I don't remember bro no one's gonna play this other than you
[1366.60s -> 1371.86s]  this is tutorial mode well it's just easy mode we'll go through it another
[1371.86s -> 1376.18s]  two or three times because if well I mean I've played this game a lot this is
[1376.18s -> 1379.66s]  like one of my favorite games I haven't played the game in six or seven years
[1379.66s -> 1382.42s]  and then before that it's been like 15 or 20 or something but you know you get
[1382.42s -> 1389.48s]  the idea you have to get a ton of zumbinis to the end to beat the game
[1389.48s -> 1399.60s]  this is one of my favorite games you got a problem I'm just going down you got a problem like do you
[1399.60s -> 1402.36s]  have a problem with me is that like I'm asking do you have a problem with me
[1402.36s -> 1405.36s]  sitting in the chair like I'm playing this you got a problem there's no sense
[1405.36s -> 1420.62s]  leaving it up to chance no the flings off the tree branch oh the flings that's
[1420.62s -> 1432.33s]  right all right you wonder why I like this game so much because all the
[1432.33s -> 1444.43s]  zumbinis just go like yeah of course I'd like the game all right so each
[1444.43s -> 1452.59s]  fling is matched to each individual zumbini so we have to figure out what
[1452.59s -> 1467.06s]  is matched with what so we're just gonna sacrifice somebody all right so blue
[1467.06s -> 1473.97s]  shoes is the treads these eyes are the mask the little hair
[1473.97s -> 1480.66s]  follicle is the helmet so we need to knock them off of this branch so we need
[1480.66s -> 1491.02s]  to find a hair follicle with those eyes okay hair follicle with okay and then
[1491.02s -> 1505.23s]  the tank it's gonna be old and unhealthy yeah
[1505.23s -> 1513.14s]  zumbinis are I love this game I used to play this when I was younger I'm just
[1513.14s -> 1520.42s]  trying to desperately key hold on to my youth okay so we don't what's the what's
[1520.42s -> 1533.66s]  the mohawk we know that the spinny is the tank green nose is blue okay so
[1533.66s -> 1552.19s]  somebody that has these eyes and a spinny yeah okay ponytails mohawk so we
[1552.19s -> 1557.23s]  have a few more options oh no we don't no it's like just two okay that's this
[1557.23s -> 1579.61s]  one it's gonna match that rock out break big brain moment I actually don't know
[1579.61s -> 1592.82s]  how much harder they make that at the higher difficulty
[1592.82s -> 1611.45s]  this sounds like a garbage disposal garbage like wait in that rock song yes
[1611.45s -> 1622.86s]  ah yes I'll be right down make yourself cozy oh that's right we have to you're
[1622.90s -> 1631.10s]  just in time for tomorrow's concerto help yourselves to a room if I remember
[1631.10s -> 1636.38s]  rehearsal go ahead find yourselves a room as the game gets harder I think they
[1636.38s -> 1641.85s]  the room stack up this tall and this wide so it gets very hard and I think
[1641.85s -> 1645.45s]  there's a timer all right so we have to see who can like be in this in like a
[1645.45s -> 1653.45s]  same hotel room okay is it about is can you go in okay is it it's probably just
[1654.33s -> 1665.52s]  shoes we're on the easiest difficulty it's definitely just shoes it's not okay
[1665.52s -> 1681.59s]  is it oh is it I don't know noses this is too blue this is blue and red eyes
[1681.59s -> 1688.39s]  it's its eyes that's the eyes all right so we need any more okay okay it's the
[1688.39s -> 1706.46s]  eyes you guys are so smart no help we have to get one batch of zoom beanies
[1706.46s -> 1715.94s]  across to the end because when it gets harder it's easy to lose people all right
[1715.94s -> 1734.46s]  yeah this plays out hey that's cool a place for everyone and everyone in a
[1734.46s -> 1754.97s]  place please protect the red glasses with you all life I'll try
[1758.61s -> 1764.35s]  mud ball wall I love this one I used to just bail this one deliberately because
[1764.35s -> 1780.24s]  it was fun just to use the toy okay so where so this is green ball with square
[1780.24s -> 1790.19s]  fire it I just went a hundred million miles per hour I got it right all right
[1790.19s -> 1795.31s]  so that was very fast I think the game is running at 60 FPS so the the game
[1795.31s -> 1804.49s]  runs at 6,000 percent speed so this is how many we're allowed to bring up so
[1804.49s -> 1809.37s]  that was a green square what is red square is red square gonna be over here
[1809.37s -> 1821.11s]  not okay so color is the column and shape is the row all right so we're
[1821.11s -> 1838.65s]  looking for I think let's just go blue and got it all right so no more just
[1838.65s -> 1844.94s]  scared me or second I thought they were doing a frog noise I was like no we're
[1844.94s -> 1851.26s]  in a swamp Chad is so stupid to find this confused confusing wait do I know
[1851.26s -> 1861.24s]  something the chat doesn't know this doesn't make sense wait am I better at
[1861.24s -> 1867.86s]  chat at a logical journey of the zoom beanies puzzle game you don't get it
[1867.86s -> 1878.42s]  are you struggling to do it you don't get it oh bad all right so let's do
[1878.42s -> 1888.67s]  triangle blue let's hope it's right there no it's right there that's fine
[1888.67s -> 1895.74s]  star blue is it has to be at some point down here all right that's fine it's
[1895.74s -> 1909.75s]  what it's circle and diamond now I get it yeah you get it eventually this gets
[1909.75s -> 1913.35s]  to be like three different colors and the board is like huge with like a
[1913.35s -> 1928.34s]  thousand different combinations all right so triangle yellow yeah triangle
[1928.34s -> 1945.46s]  pink hurry up all right we got him now we need to do star green educational
[1945.46s -> 1954.34s]  experience how can you keep mentioning the harder difficulty I don't know I

[1971.32s -> 1984.92s]  favorite character and he's proving to you why all right here it is here comes
[1985.16s -> 1992.08s]  the best part of the whole game this is the single best part of the whole game

[2359.12s -> 2364.72s]  else I can't believe I killed the only person everybody wanted me to save and
[2364.72s -> 2369.08s]  that's the only person that's not gonna make it to the end that's the only one
[2369.08s -> 2394.47s]  the only one that didn't make it all right we got not this one yeah I've been
[2394.63s -> 2401.75s]  like just a burpee I'm not I don't know why it's happening to my body of my
[2401.75s -> 2430.84s]  body is turning old okay getting old and burpee happens to the best of us there
[2430.84s -> 2436.16s]  we go yeah I'm speeding it up I'm speeding it up I'm going much faster than
[2436.16s -> 2469.09s]  I was before all right I can't believe I killed that person okay restart we're
[2469.13s -> 2488.12s]  gonna restart okay I'm looking for no you're this one here some beanies do
[2488.12s -> 2511.56s]  not have an afterlife oh I'm sorry how do you know that it'll start getting
[2511.56s -> 2523.24s]  easier here hey pink shoes yeah here we go but they're lying they have an
[2523.24s -> 2535.85s]  afterlife but it sucks okay pink shoes oh I almost did this
[2535.85s -> 2563.13s]  one green nose who the hell is it pink nose it's gonna be one of the springs
[2563.13s -> 2588.68s]  right has to be has to be spring no I think it's this one why am I doing the
[2588.68s -> 2611.12s]  Bioshock infinite thing and it was a price I paid price I paid all right how
[2611.12s -> 2630.42s]  you doing today I'm doing good you're doing good too you good we're about to
[2630.42s -> 2658.04s]  be there we made it to some beanieville no this more this is the one that gets in
[2658.04s -> 2664.27s]  my head because you have to put this two entry points and depending on what they
[2664.27s -> 2667.63s]  have for features they move in a different direction so I have to be
[2667.63s -> 2673.70s]  careful so if somebody goes here and they have these eyes they're gonna stop
[2673.70s -> 2680.18s]  here and move this way then up up right so anybody that has these eyes is safe
[2680.18s -> 2690.30s]  but wait I don't want to do that yeah I do what if you don't okay if you do not
[2690.30s -> 2698.54s]  have these eyes you're dead if you go this way so let's get this right because
[2698.54s -> 2707.09s]  I don't want to lose anybody else so let's say you are a spring and I put
[2707.09s -> 2712.54s]  you this way you're gonna go straight through that you're gonna go up right
[2712.54s -> 2725.78s]  down left up right right okay it's gonna turn this thing that way I mean no I
[2725.78s -> 2732.35s]  mean she's dead no she's not oh fuck she has the hair oh that's right it's
[2732.35s -> 2745.99s]  all right everybody wave bye when she passes by am I gonna make it oh I don't
[2745.99s -> 2758.38s]  know if that means but hopefully it's yes yeah okay well hold on I always had
[2758.38s -> 2764.10s]  trouble with this one even on like the kids difficulty okay so up you don't
[2764.10s -> 2771.54s]  have those eyes you'll go right if you have the mohawk you're gonna go down up
[2771.86s -> 2777.09s]  down left die shit let's just get everybody over there that we know we
[2777.09s -> 2805.06s]  can get over there okay so if you have hair you need to go now because no yep
[2805.06s -> 2810.82s]  so all the eyes are gone so if you have this you're gonna go up you're gonna go
[2810.82s -> 2827.86s]  through this right okay here we go I mean no I mean wrong bad what you made
[2827.86s -> 2836.36s]  it we talked about that I made it it's correct okay so now if I do a mohawk
[2836.36s -> 2844.53s]  it's gonna go up up right down left up right so we can't have a mohawk go that
[2844.53s -> 2859.78s]  way chat is waffling do more funny murders ha ha ha this is only gonna get
[2859.78s -> 2865.37s]  way harder so trust me if you're sitting here waiting to make fun of me hey Jerma
[2865.37s -> 2868.65s]  I was watching your stream yesterday and I didn't have a chance to make fun of
[2868.65s -> 2872.45s]  how stupid you were I'm kind of bored not being able to make fun of you not
[2872.45s -> 2875.61s]  being able to do this children's puzzle game so I just I think I'm gonna take a
[2875.61s -> 2879.63s]  break of watching your stream for a few weeks just wait just wait till we play
[2879.63s -> 2881.99s]  on the medium and hard difficulties because you're probably gonna be gonna
[2881.99s -> 2891.08s]  get your your fill of that okay so now I think I can just alternate because if I
[2891.08s -> 2919.78s]  do the hair now all right is this right no yes it is okay is somebody dead here
[2920.26s -> 2942.30s]  okay you go up right okay yeah we're good only one person done we got what
[2942.30s -> 2974.98s]  14 out of 16 we're good hey what happened to the red glasses well we
[2974.98s -> 2998.55s]  tried to hold us together that you just reminded me we did it
[3007.15s -> 3023.34s]  all right how many did we get 14 yes this windmill was brought to honor the
[3023.34s -> 3029.78s]  Zumbinis who flushed the finicky flings in hotel dementia had pleasant dreams
[3029.78s -> 3034.30s]  and catapulted cleanly over a mud ball wall and the traveling was not so easy
[3034.30s -> 3042.72s]  okay look at all of our friends that made it as you bring Zumbinis to Zumbini
[3043.28s -> 3051.33s]  more structures are created more stuff is available as you see we got the
[3051.33s -> 3065.17s]  windmill and now let's go back very cool okay not so easy very hard very very
[3065.17s -> 3084.17s]  hard what is it okay there are 384 Zumbinis so how do we change these I
[3084.17s -> 3095.57s]  forget I'm not press it because for journey of practice we're not taking
[3095.57s -> 3107.71s]  anybody how do I make it harder it scales with you how many you save oh
[3107.71s -> 3114.54s]  okay all right so we're gonna go up this time we went down and took us this way
[3114.54s -> 3117.22s]  up is gonna take us around this way so let's just do it again
[3117.22s -> 3120.98s]  journey just gets harder okay yeah let's go let's go let's get all 384
[3120.98s -> 3154.10s]  glasses glasses glasses glasses that's too many glasses way too many fuck it
[3154.30s -> 3165.92s]  all right now we speedrun now we understand how it works we go fast
[3165.92s -> 3175.20s]  tossed about by a stormy sea the Zumbinis reach the shore speed runtime
[3175.20s -> 3180.95s]  so you get how it works we have to get all the Zumbinis over to the Zumbini
[3180.95s -> 3187.79s]  island remember how this one works we're just gonna go all right good start let's
[3187.79s -> 3191.71s]  see if it's probably just wheels it's definitely just wheels we're still on
[3191.71s -> 3203.79s]  easy I think oh oh oh oh they made it harder maybe it's noses blue got it got
[3203.79s -> 3214.41s]  it all right what about pink let's go pink up here pink is also down here the
[3214.41s -> 3222.11s]  rock does look like you this does not look like me at all this looks nothing
[3222.11s -> 3235.88s]  like my face it looks zero and I mean zero wait a minute so what is it then
[3235.88s -> 3257.38s]  why did you not is it not noses okay so it's spinners blue shoes are and is that
[3257.38s -> 3262.94s]  correct no that's not correct you're gonna kill these things is it the hair
[3262.94s -> 3276.85s]  no it's not is it that I think maybe it is the hair all right this one is a
[3276.85s -> 3290.32s]  ponytail snap made a Zumbini okay I'm gonna put this on screen I like this I
[3290.32s -> 3311.32s]  like this I'm putting it here although it's the shoes from Jen loss that's
[3311.32s -> 3343.20s]  funny there we go all right I'm in all right so was hair okay is it mohawk these
[3343.20s -> 3348.79s]  ones were okay yeah all right we're good let's go that's good cuz I could have
[3348.79s -> 3364.19s]  only made one more mistake I'll lose oh what about I gotta do me too okay let's
[3364.19s -> 3391.39s]  put me over here oh fuck I die I can't keep going I got I got eliminated these
[3391.39s -> 3397.99s]  stone guards have their rules so do proceed with skin zoom beanies one guard
[3397.99s -> 3420.06s]  won't allow surely here we go again all right little pebbles don't screw it up
[3420.06s -> 3425.46s]  because if you lose anybody in the early game you may as well just restart
[3425.46s -> 3440.44s]  just gotta pick up pick it all right all right what about this side okay is it
[3440.44s -> 3448.80s]  propeller it's not propeller it's also not potentially not even knows is it
[3448.80s -> 3459.08s]  eyes enjoy yourself okay but you might not be happy with okay
[3459.12s -> 3465.15s]  glasses all glasses this way you're gonna stop one of these I know you are
[3465.15s -> 3478.71s]  don't be shy good welcome propellers good all right what about skateboards
[3478.71s -> 3495.34s]  hello skateboards step right up okay propeller spring this way we must be
[3495.34s -> 3503.04s]  selective about our clientele well welcome hello this way welcome all
[3503.08s -> 3514.74s]  right pink shoes this way have a good time nailed it oh what's wrong with this
[3514.74s -> 3529.14s]  character blue wait what no glass oh have a good time you did it you'll save
[3529.14s -> 3537.68s]  them all you're throwing I'm all fine you've done quite well how delightful
[3537.68s -> 3544.44s]  so stupid travelers continue on through this dusty wasteland you have to deduce
[3544.44s -> 3561.02s]  it first man all right pizza troll time should still be pretty easy
[3561.02s -> 3579.44s]  whatever you are always start with cheese every time okay let's do same
[3579.44s -> 3589.20s]  thing as the last time let's see if the RNG gave us the exact same thing based
[3589.20s -> 3610.43s]  okay what about just helping us more stuff more stuff I think this guy in
[3610.43s -> 3622.35s]  particular formed my entire personality somehow more stuff so if I I gotta get
[3622.35s -> 3640.05s]  this right don't like that maybe something Moscow okay so it's mushrooms
[3640.05s -> 3676.54s]  and jalapenos I love the other two characters in this eventually as you
[3676.54s -> 3679.58s]  keep going and progressing you get harder the other two characters are
[3679.58s -> 3687.42s]  great too you have to please three different people with tons of toppings
[3687.42s -> 3711.50s]  boilers why this a campsite with hot soup all ready to meet but when they're
[3711.50s -> 3723.44s]  ready to move on they'll need a group of 16 along the way go up we do not go up
[3723.44s -> 3733.04s]  yet beanies must have something in common with their neighbor to sit on
[3733.04s -> 3739.20s]  Captain Cajun's oh you need to match somebody this gets ridiculous I
[3739.20s -> 3755.69s]  remember later on that's be perfect welcome to the boat about right they
[3755.69s -> 3758.97s]  have to have something in common whatever you want to I don't really
[3759.97s -> 3785.92s]  have to have something in common with your neighbor blue noses do hair we'll
[3785.92s -> 3809.62s]  do noses first blue nose and then hair and then wait there you go you got this
[3809.62s -> 3832.60s]  green bring hair there you go you got it okay hold on you blew it this is not
[3832.60s -> 3884.24s]  on a time list no what what hair oh shit right sure shit hold on is there any
[3884.24s -> 3896.84s]  yellow noses this will do it right well it's no yeah I need a yellow nose at the
[3896.84s -> 3927.52s]  start what if I did this and go I'll give you a little bit of a tidbit in
[3927.52s -> 3932.16s]  30 years that I've come back and played this game every like half deck every
[3932.76s -> 3940.06s]  so I've never beaten this truly it's always wrong especially the medium to
[3940.06s -> 3944.52s]  hard ones I think is impossible I think they actually made it not possible so
[3944.52s -> 3948.36s]  you guys can help when we get to hard because it's actually not physically
[3948.36s -> 3958.76s]  possible to beat it this is on easy okay um so what happens here is I believe you
[3958.76s -> 3964.50s]  put somebody on a frog and they jump out and they have to match a path based on
[3964.50s -> 3969.84s]  the color or the shape because you can't move anything so I have to put
[3969.84s -> 3973.00s]  this somewhere where it's gonna get to the other side based on I don't know
[3973.00s -> 3980.53s]  shape this one is shaped like the lily pad here so if I put this one here it'll
[3980.53s -> 3996.91s]  go up and then they'll die I think I'm just gonna I will have to figure it out
[3996.91s -> 4001.05s]  I'm just gonna go for it because this one is blue that you can only put this
[4001.05s -> 4006.48s]  on a blue so they're based on color and shape so okay if I put this one here
[4006.48s -> 4021.19s]  this is what the three leaf one no okay this where am I going oh should have
[4021.19s -> 4026.25s]  missed it this one is correct but three leaf because it'll go here and then
[4026.25s -> 4035.14s]  it'll go up okay so this one is correct for the three leaf get somebody on here
[4035.14s -> 4051.52s]  all right yellow let's go this way but wait a minute is it the flower it's
[4051.52s -> 4064.56s]  looking at little four leaf or leaf what can I start here okay start here I just
[4064.56s -> 4070.69s]  do that as many times I want four leaf does not have a path I don't think so
[4070.69s -> 4081.07s]  the line is the color yeah so if I go pink pink can know yeah wait all right
[4081.07s -> 4092.53s]  pink can do it right here each frog can be used twice okay that's good to know
[4092.53s -> 4104.72s]  what about blue this looks pretty solid yeah it's a solid for blue with X X does
[4104.72s -> 4116.32s]  not have a starting path so fuck with this one this one also does not have a
[4116.32s -> 4133.54s]  starting path dark blue has a path what about the pac-man pac-man has a starting
[4133.54s -> 4146.04s]  path and doesn't go anywhere no wait all right pac-man has the correct path here
[4146.04s -> 4165.18s]  for red what about this shape yeah all right this shape has a path right here
[4165.18s -> 4181.97s]  it doesn't matter right each one can be used twice so this is fine what yellow
[4181.97s -> 4185.75s]  yellow yeah yellow it can do it too will they hurt each other if they run into
[4185.75s -> 4204.95s]  each other which one was it this one right yeah this one here okay what about
[4204.99s -> 4220.32s]  this I can start here oh no this doesn't work here this doesn't work either I
[4220.32s -> 4230.60s]  don't think this one works at all what about X no yellow yellow can still go I
[4230.60s -> 4246.36s]  need four more diamond does work where are you seeing diamond working does no
[4246.36s -> 4260.58s]  diamond doesn't have a path where do you see diamonds path down up turning it does
[4260.58s -> 4268.36s]  it doesn't does bottom diamond at the bottom works huh right right down no it
[4268.44s -> 4281.00s]  doesn't it gets stuck right here no wait like diamond diamond diamond diamond
[4281.00s -> 4298.83s]  diamond diamond no middle middle middle teal diamond no look look see it gets
[4298.83s -> 4314.66s]  trapped right here ah three leaf well any three more it was a three leave that
[4314.66s -> 4321.27s]  worked already wasn't it because this one here yeah it's this one here
[4321.27s -> 4344.43s]  oh is that pac-man one over here right why so many ads you should not be
[4344.43s -> 4350.67s]  getting any ads I mean when you come to the stream you get when I can't turn
[4350.67s -> 4359.23s]  those off there's a lot of ads right now I didn't run any all right one more who's
[4359.23s -> 4372.18s]  the last one the diamond okay I haven't gotten any I've gotten 12 I think you're
[4372.18s -> 4391.81s]  making that up we want to play an app do you guys remember when you guys would
[4391.81s -> 4406.15s]  force me to run ads and you pretended to like it it was really weird it was like
[4406.15s -> 4411.67s]  ads oh my god pogchamp please more ads and you guys weren't hitting you actually
[4411.67s -> 4430.96s]  wanted me to do it me it was very funny and weird I feel like the the upper path
[4430.96s -> 4437.47s]  is the hard path because I remember some of these being very very very hard later
[4437.47s -> 4441.96s]  this being one of them I don't know what this wants me to do so we're gonna have
[4441.96s -> 4452.48s]  to figure it out I think it's hair has to match hair so there and there nobody
[4452.64s -> 4472.79s]  has this haircut nobody else has this haircut nose and nose was a green nose
[4472.79s -> 4481.34s]  did I kill that okay I thought I killed that person I did I just misclicked okay

[4887.86s -> 4896.16s]  I remember when I was younger. I think I even asked my mother to help me do some of these things in this game.
[4896.16s -> 4899.88s]  And she was like, I just I can't do this, Jeremy.
[4899.88s -> 4904.68s]  Just like, I can't, I don't understand, I can't do this.
[4906.20s -> 4908.20s]  Yo, just wait, you'll see.
[4913.50s -> 4915.50s]  You'll come!
[4926.92s -> 4930.62s]  All right, we got her back.
[4931.02s -> 4947.90s]  Throughout these gloomy mountains, strange carvings left by ancient peoples are everywhere.
[4949.96s -> 4958.86s]  Well, I just turned off pre-roll ads for how long did it say? Like 20 minutes? That's like not a bad thing.
[4959.42s -> 4967.32s]  Okay. All right, here we go. You gotta go buy glasses.
[4968.04s -> 4978.89s]  So glasses first. I thought she was gone.
[4988.18s -> 4992.57s]  All right, we're good.
[4992.57s -> 4995.30s]  What is that? I can't tell what that is.
[5004.60s -> 5006.60s]  And then sunglasses.
[5006.84s -> 5008.60s]  What?
[5008.60s -> 5011.24s]  Oh, no, it's not. All right, don't close the gate on them.
[5012.36s -> 5015.08s]  What?
[5015.08s -> 5019.75s]  Uh-oh. Wait, what's? Oh, there's one more of these.
[5024.66s -> 5029.02s]  World trusted guide.
[5029.50s -> 5037.58s]  You run a few minutes of ads in a row and you can disable them for an hour.
[5038.38s -> 5045.74s]  I really just hate running ads. Use the crystal filters to change the Zumbini's reflection.
[5046.30s -> 5049.50s]  It will give them crystal slamming protection.
[5053.58s -> 5056.30s]  All right, I've got all 16. We're almost there.
[5064.78s -> 5067.90s]  Okay, this one takes the most time, obviously.
[5068.70s -> 5070.54s]  We have to get it right.
[5070.54s -> 5091.40s]  I have to pee so bad, but no, I'm not peeing until I beat the Zumbini's.
[5093.40s -> 5094.76s]  At least get
[5094.76s -> 5099.72s]  this group over.
[5099.72s -> 5102.98s]  Oh, right here.
[5108.26s -> 5113.83s]  Okay, next.
[5117.14s -> 5120.31s]  I love that little like bird sound, whatever it is. It's like bats.
[5125.83s -> 5134.90s]  Right here, a diaper.
[5134.98s -> 5138.90s]  I don't trust that, honestly. I don't need it, but I don't, I don't, I don't trust it.
[5145.29s -> 5147.13s]  I just don't trust it.
[5147.13s -> 5149.61s]  An adult diaper to me is like, I don't know. I feel like I
[5150.09s -> 5152.97s]  Sometimes I do like a full 60 second piss. I don't think it would work.
[5157.64s -> 5170.10s]  Okay. Oh, there we go.
[5180.20s -> 5201.26s]  60 second piss is easy. I don't think so. Spring?
[5206.26s -> 5211.22s]  Well, there's only two springs. So if it's a spring and it doesn't, yeah, it's not gonna match.
[5214.84s -> 5232.68s]  How much is 60 seconds to gallons? I don't, I don't know. Gallons?
[5234.42s -> 5236.74s]  I wonder. I'll figure it out one day.
[5236.74s -> 5257.14s]  Okay.
[5257.22s -> 5268.47s]  I'm eating a whole tray of ice. Why are you doing that? Did you make ice popsicles? Because if you did, cool.
[5269.27s -> 5270.97s]  But if you didn't, then
[5270.97s -> 5279.42s]  what are you doing?
[5279.90s -> 5287.37s]  Okay.
[5287.37s -> 5289.85s]  See, this one takes the longest, but this is the patience.
[5290.49s -> 5292.41s]  This is the patience part of the game.
[5293.29s -> 5296.65s]  It's really easy to be like, oh, just let's go and hurry up, but you'll make a mistake.
[5297.45s -> 5325.67s]  Bottom right. Hurry up.
[5326.34s -> 5338.63s]  I just did it. Okay.
[5343.86s -> 5347.86s]  What is wrong with the stream tags?
[5348.18s -> 5355.22s]  Um, he's having enough fiber. See, see how it off-brand eats bugs.
[5355.62s -> 5362.23s]  I don't know because I don't, I don't, the tags just don't, I don't really care.
[5368.20s -> 5370.52s]  Almost fucked it up. See, that's what happens in your rush.
[5386.92s -> 5389.48s]  How does the mail work?
[5389.80s -> 5392.25s]  Um,
[5392.25s -> 5398.01s]  go look up like a science fucking video. I don't know. Like, I know, but I don't want to sit here to explain it.
[5398.41s -> 5402.25s]  It's like, I don't know. It's a big long complicated process with a lot of moving parts.
[5402.81s -> 5406.65s]  It's probably a YouTube video about like, how does the mail get sorted and shipped?
[5407.45s -> 5409.45s]  Why do you want me to tell you that? I don't know.
[5426.90s -> 5433.05s]  Hey, dude, how does it, how does a mail work?
[5437.21s -> 5439.58s]  I don't know.
[5439.58s -> 5442.06s]  You put it into the mailbox and the
[5442.78s -> 5446.14s]  carrier picks it up, brings it to a sorting facility and
[5447.50s -> 5449.50s]  sends it out with different carriers.
[5450.62s -> 5459.59s]  Oh, look it up.
[5459.59s -> 5461.59s]  All right, I'm gonna mess this up. I have to pay attention.
[5469.05s -> 5471.66s]  Okay, only
[5471.66s -> 5475.42s]  ponytails can go this way or they die.
[5477.45s -> 5484.73s]  So if you have a ponytail, you cannot go this way. You are dead. So all ponytails, please
[5485.29s -> 5487.29s]  line up at this one.
[5493.00s -> 5511.37s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's not necessarily true. Hold on. Yes, it is. How much is this game?
[5511.77s -> 5515.08s]  Um
[5515.54s -> 5521.03s]  Owned it for a very long time. How long I think it's like
[5521.75s -> 5524.15s]  10 bucks 5 bucks 20 bucks
[5524.87s -> 5526.87s]  It can't be more than that
[5533.85s -> 5537.37s]  Okay, so let's get this right because I see a lot of bullshit over here
[5538.25s -> 5543.37s]  So if I take this person with the glasses and I have you go up here, you're gonna go right
[5544.25s -> 5549.21s]  Up, you're gonna pass this you're gonna pass this and you're gonna be fine
[5555.42s -> 5556.98s]  so now
[5556.98s -> 5562.02s]  Glasses goes this way if I put glasses here again, it's gonna go right up and then get
[5562.74s -> 5565.69s]  Completely screwed up and die. So
[5567.29s -> 5569.29s]  It has to be somebody with
[5569.80s -> 5571.80s]  What about sunglasses if I do sunglasses?
[5572.36s -> 5585.42s]  We're good. So we have to alternate until there are no more glasses left. No, what do you mean? No what?
[5585.42s -> 5591.78s]  No, that's right. I got it. So then I do the the glasses will go up and be fine
[5592.68s -> 5600.22s]  I'm fine. What do you guys chat? What are you going about? Have you gotten the grimace meal yet? No, I'll probably try it eventually here
[5602.95s -> 5611.96s]  I got it because now i'll do the glasses will go up into the right and then be fine and then we do sunglasses
[5613.88s -> 5630.22s]  I didn't fuck it up. Oh, no, I got it. You guys are just you gaslighting
[5631.56s -> 5646.76s]  Okay, now it doesn't matter now everybody can just go on it. I hope this is right
[5655.86s -> 5657.86s]  Yeah, it doesn't matter anymore. I got it
[5662.26s -> 5664.70s]  All right, all 16 made it
[5665.10s -> 5668.17s]  Everybody died
[5668.97s -> 5675.30s]  Let's go
[5680.81s -> 5682.81s]  One died in the crystal. Oh
[5683.37s -> 5687.48s]  This is this be the place they've been seeking
[5691.16s -> 5705.62s]  I like when he does the funny voice. Yeah, I don't know if you can hear the audio wine
[5706.50s -> 5709.35s]  it's like
[5709.35s -> 5711.10s]  Got a house
[5711.10s -> 5713.34s]  The schoolhouse salutes the zoom beanies who?
[5714.14s -> 5718.94s]  armed captain cajun rode tattooed toads and knew how to network
[5719.74s -> 5724.60s]  Got a house
[5725.00s -> 5736.15s]  Trying to get some uh, some dwellings here this clock tower
[5737.70s -> 5742.89s]  Cool building out the village
[5747.53s -> 5750.34s]  Okay, still doing the journey
[5751.26s -> 5756.86s]  It's still on a pretty we still we still on easy. Let's try to speed run after I p I'll be right back
[5757.02s -> 6052.06s]  Give you a warning that the music was stopping and I saw a monkey ass. Yeah. Yeah, I see if i've seen a few monkey asses
[6052.70s -> 6068.70s]  You've gone for a long time. What was I? I wasn't gone for that long. Well, I had to pee and then I had to refill my water
[6069.26s -> 6072.26s]  Beverage, why did you say it like that?
[6073.08s -> 6076.04s]  Why didn't you just say water you said water and then pause and said beverage
[6076.12s -> 6081.83s]  Why did you why did you pause? Why did you couldn't you just you could have just said water what's in the water?
[6085.02s -> 6087.16s]  a little bit of a uh
[6087.16s -> 6088.62s]  a bit of a tea
[6088.62s -> 6090.70s]  Powdered drink thingy having it today
[6093.66s -> 6102.52s]  Okay, let's go. It's like I fuck with you guys and then I end up just fucking with myself
[6114.78s -> 6119.58s]  All right. Is this a good makeup here?
[6119.58s -> 6123.42s]  I'm speed running is i'm gonna go as fast I can now because I think after we do this next one
[6123.42s -> 6126.86s]  We should unlock the next difficulty. So let's go i'm going doesn't matter what is i'll make it work
[6127.26s -> 6134.34s]  You want variety? Yeah
[6135.06s -> 6147.72s]  I think this is pretty good. Maybe some more of the smaller eyes like this. Just make them all the same
[6148.54s -> 6151.26s]  I think you actually get soft locked if you do that
[6158.46s -> 6163.34s]  Because if one of the bridges for instance doesn't allow red noses and everybody has a red nose you they all die
[6176.30s -> 6178.30s]  Also, um, can we get a pole?
[6179.02s -> 6183.14s]  Do you want me to skip the intro cut scenes for each little game?
[6183.70s -> 6187.54s]  If we speed right, you know what I mean? All right, let's go speed run
[6189.51s -> 6193.35s]  All right, it's gonna be shoes probably, uh, we got pink shoes going up here
[6194.55s -> 6199.43s]  Is that correct? This looks pretty good. All right, what about um,
[6200.52s -> 6202.04s]  No, that's not right
[6202.04s -> 6204.41s]  So what is it then?
[6204.49s -> 6206.49s]  Okay, it could be
[6207.99s -> 6210.39s]  Different eyes. All right. What about is it eyes?
[6212.79s -> 6216.70s]  Might be looks good so far
[6217.59s -> 6221.05s]  Uh-huh. I think it's based on eyes
[6225.75s -> 6229.02s]  up
[6229.02s -> 6232.09s]  Is it not eyes hair
[6235.03s -> 6241.22s]  So what makes you able to go up here nose? All right, it's noses
[6250.07s -> 6251.19s]  What?
[6251.19s -> 6255.64s]  It's only pink allowed in the bottom
[6258.38s -> 6260.38s]  So many people are going on this first bridge
[6262.98s -> 6264.18s]  Okay
[6264.18s -> 6268.55s]  well
[6268.55s -> 6270.95s]  Uh, I actually can't I gotta be careful because
[6271.99s -> 6275.91s]  All right, can yellow go here?
[6277.03s -> 6279.75s]  Okay, i'm gonna everyone's dead. They're all dead after this
[6280.97s -> 6282.97s]  Because I okay. I know you go
[6283.43s -> 6284.63s]  Up here
[6284.63s -> 6288.49s]  Does everybody go up here but pink if I get it wrong, they're dead
[6290.07s -> 6293.66s]  Only pink at the bottom
[6293.74s -> 6295.35s]  What?
[6295.35s -> 6297.43s]  That's weird. Okay. Well, we made it
[6300.60s -> 6302.09s]  You
[6302.09s -> 6306.90s]  You'll save them all. Are you dumb? No, that's a weird
[6307.70s -> 6312.82s]  Only two people go on the bottom bridge. That's weird. This doesn't usually happen that way guards have their rules
[6313.14s -> 6315.14s]  So do proceed with skill
[6315.76s -> 6318.10s]  Zumbini's one guard won't allow
[6323.99s -> 6327.98s]  You are dumb. Hey, i'll run another ad if you say that again
[6328.78s -> 6331.10s]  I'm not actually gonna run another ad. Welcome
[6334.89s -> 6340.01s]  Okay, let's just go. Okay
[6341.05s -> 6344.73s]  We must be selective about our clientele. Have a vote over here
[6347.90s -> 6356.55s]  Let's try um noses enjoy yourself. Okay, is it all yellow noses? Is it a nose playthrough this time? All right
[6363.61s -> 6365.93s]  Enjoy yourself. Okay blue noses
[6366.41s -> 6378.04s]  What's the problem? Welcome
[6379.88s -> 6385.50s]  The hair
[6385.50s -> 6390.25s]  Enjoy yourself
[6390.25s -> 6396.33s]  I misunderstood what this stream was gonna be. I thought you were gonna drive around on one of those ice cleaners for skating rinks
[6396.65s -> 6404.20s]  I mean that's
[6404.60s -> 6415.26s]  That's funny. All right hair who else has that spiky hair you do. All right you
[6416.94s -> 6419.37s]  This way, okay
[6421.53s -> 6429.21s]  Speed run go
[6430.09s -> 6436.98s]  Okay, not a single person has been able to go up and to be selective about our clientele
[6437.70s -> 6442.09s]  We can't go up in this area. Why? Okay by me
[6449.93s -> 6453.06s]  Have a good time
[6454.57s -> 6456.57s]  Uh, oh they're okay, right?
[6457.13s -> 6461.08s]  We're good
[6461.08s -> 6463.32s]  Splendid say hi to arno
[6464.28s -> 6470.52s]  Say hi to auto our brave travelers. I'll say hi to auto this dusty wasteland until they meet
[6471.08s -> 6480.74s]  Oh
[6484.41s -> 6487.05s]  All right, still simple still basic we're good
[6489.34s -> 6491.34s]  Whatever you are
[6496.86s -> 6503.74s]  So this formula starts to become impossible to we have to go a little bit more detailed but no cheese
[6521.10s -> 6524.48s]  All right, so you like pepperoni and mushrooms
[6525.28s -> 6533.46s]  More more, okay, crony mushrooms and peppers
[6545.00s -> 6553.39s]  You want them all? All right. Well, here you go
[6562.25s -> 6565.29s]  I think eventually you start making ice creams too for them, right?
[6566.33s -> 6577.36s]  Spoiler, I know but whatever it's fun. Everything but cheese
[6588.75s -> 6595.80s]  You're adjusting to the trials of the journey like look she messed up if you must we're going down
[6596.76s -> 6599.00s]  I'm going down. I'm not the up is harder
[6605.15s -> 6607.95s]  There's no sense leaving it up to chance
[6610.59s -> 6614.35s]  Okay, this we know this one. All right, so let's just get somebody to go forward
[6622.72s -> 6626.30s]  All right, so spring is
[6627.34s -> 6629.34s]  uh heels
[6629.50s -> 6634.97s]  Can we match anything here? All right, so we got all right these eyes. All right
[6635.98s -> 6638.86s]  I would say the same like three words a lot today
[6639.50s -> 6647.61s]  What about the hair? All right yellow?
[6648.17s -> 6652.99s]  Shit, all right. So yellow noses are blue noses
[6658.01s -> 6661.37s]  Just take a guess here. All right. Shit. Stop saying that
[6662.41s -> 6664.17s]  Fuck it in my own head
[6664.17s -> 6671.04s]  I can't I can't help but I have to it's like a filler word for my brain
[6675.76s -> 6684.84s]  So it has to be these two. There's only two more yellow noses
[6687.74s -> 6694.65s]  Yeah
[6705.60s -> 6707.60s]  This one
[6709.84s -> 6722.96s]  It's almost no more room on the tree oh it's pink shoes pink shoes this one
[6728.30s -> 6750.57s]  All right, this one's easy i'm skipping I know
[6751.92s -> 6756.96s]  I know don't skip don't skip. How could you skip zoom beanies intro cut scenes? I know but we'll watch them again
[6757.52s -> 6769.13s]  See if it's hair it might be here it might be noses too nose it looks like it's noses again
[6781.26s -> 6783.98s]  All right, so if it's yellow noses then
[6784.70s -> 6790.38s]  That's it green
[6807.00s -> 6813.37s]  The door opening noise is the same on the tf2 team selection screen. It is you're right
[6814.14s -> 6817.82s]  Cool a place for everyone and everyone in a place
[6820.52s -> 6827.53s]  You know that although I say that but I've I hear sounds in games and in movies and I go I know where that's from
[6833.32s -> 6837.79s]  My favorite puzzle
[6837.79s -> 6839.79s]  All right, let's get us squared up
[6840.57s -> 6843.07s]  Okay, so this is green
[6843.07s -> 6845.07s]  So triangle yellow
[6845.63s -> 6850.00s]  Oh red
[6850.00s -> 6851.52s]  so red
[6851.52s -> 6853.76s]  Some of the shape of triangle blue
[6856.11s -> 6858.11s]  Oh crap
[6858.75s -> 6861.39s]  Whoa, what am I doing? It's pink. Okay
[6869.68s -> 6871.36s]  Yellow
[6871.36s -> 6884.33s]  square
[6884.33s -> 6885.61s]  yellow
[6885.61s -> 6890.70s]  circle
[6890.70s -> 6892.70s]  What the fuck is this game?
[6892.78s -> 6894.78s]  Laughing my ass off
[6895.76s -> 6902.54s]  Logical journey of the zoom beanies
[6903.26s -> 6920.51s]  I don't want to run out of juice here circle red
[6925.96s -> 6933.13s]  red triangle
[6933.61s -> 6936.89s]  Wait, what? Oh shit. No, no, no triangle blue
[6938.49s -> 6944.57s]  Whoa, wait, what's happening blue? Wait blue circle. I'm gonna people are gonna die people are dead
[6948.72s -> 6951.85s]  I have one shot left. It's pink diamond
[6952.17s -> 6959.24s]  I have enough for one more shot. It's pink diamond
[6963.39s -> 6967.16s]  Thank god, that was it I would have lost I almost just threw one easy
[6992.17s -> 6997.47s]  Another relaxing campsite ready and waiting for zoom beanies
[6998.17s -> 7000.17s]  And they'll need their rest
[7000.49s -> 7006.75s]  The darkest most dangerous part of the journey is yet to come
[7016.11s -> 7019.55s]  There are two other zoom beanies games that were apparently dog shit
[7021.71s -> 7024.59s]  I want to play them. I never played them even when I was younger
[7030.00s -> 7033.66s]  They were good
[7033.66s -> 7035.82s]  How do they compare to the logical journey of the zoom beanies?
[7037.40s -> 7053.95s]  Mountain rescue is super good. All right, i'm willing to try it spring. This pace is so much better
[7079.52s -> 7083.29s]  This is way too scary
[7086.97s -> 7092.46s]  What are you talking about got it right off the bat
[7093.90s -> 7103.05s]  I gotta go fast. I told you I was not gonna just mess around right now. Here we go. All right
[7104.01s -> 7106.01s]  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh
[7106.25s -> 7115.12s]  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh
[7123.28s -> 7136.43s]  Trembling and shivering and sweating because this game is so scary
[7137.15s -> 7147.15s]  Well, um, I don't know. I wonder how well you do with the back of cereal boxes because that's the same amount of fear inducing
[7147.87s -> 7149.31s]  imagery
[7149.31s -> 7151.39s]  So I I don't know what to tell you
[7151.39s -> 7162.19s]  Yeah
[7162.19s -> 7166.51s]  All right, we're gonna go by noses first let's go red nose
[7179.26s -> 7186.94s]  Um
[7186.94s -> 7192.96s]  Nope, that's wrong
[7193.60s -> 7208.06s]  How many zoom beanies you think you could eat I don't know how big zoom beanies are I think they're really small
[7214.80s -> 7228.73s]  Why would I want to eat the zoom beanies
[7237.69s -> 7240.09s]  I'm not even gonna give that a response because it was so
[7241.67s -> 7246.34s]  Unbelievably stupid. Okay
[7247.16s -> 7258.09s]  They look delicious
[7258.55s -> 7277.34s]  Unbelievably out of bounds. Okay. All right. All right. They look like candy
[7296.12s -> 7300.65s]  Gargamel there's gargamel from the smurfs
[7303.44s -> 7314.72s]  Wait, so gargamel's whole thing was he wanted to eat them. That was his whole villain schtick because I'm going to eat the smurfs
[7318.32s -> 7319.68s]  What why?
[7319.68s -> 7327.88s]  It wasn't about like world domination or something
[7327.88s -> 7330.84s]  It was he just wanted to eat them because he thought they looked like they would taste good
[7334.22s -> 7336.22s]  Because they have an eternal life
[7338.44s -> 7343.88s]  The smurfs live forever. No, they don't the smurfs do not live forever. They don't have eternal life
[7345.00s -> 7346.36s]  They'd live
[7346.36s -> 7348.36s]  Like as long as a crane fly
[7349.16s -> 7351.40s]  Like fucking four days. What are you talking about?
[7364.19s -> 7369.84s]  No, dude, but what about papa smurf? Have you not seen the movie?
[7370.78s -> 7378.41s]  No, i've not seen any of the smurf movies I can't say i've witnessed any of the smurf movies
[7380.44s -> 7389.92s]  I've seen some of the old smurf cartoons
[7390.96s -> 7393.20s]  from the 80s and 90s
[7393.84s -> 7398.11s]  But not any of the movies when they went 3d. I haven't seen any of them
[7416.44s -> 7422.11s]  Where's the zoom beanie the lower button? Oh, it's gonna mess me up
[7424.04s -> 7432.86s]  Didn't you play smurfs dance party smurfs smurfs quests
[7434.11s -> 7443.07s]  Quests i'm gonna mess up your brain for a little while. Our language is so weird say quests
[7444.49s -> 7446.40s]  quests
[7446.40s -> 7448.96s]  We make like a
[7450.16s -> 7457.20s]  Quests quests. Oh, I have to do some I have to do some quests. It's it's a double
[7458.48s -> 7460.44s]  I didn't realize you're doing it

[7463.36s -> 7465.79s]  quests
[7465.79s -> 7467.79s]  You're never gonna be able to say that word ever again
[7481.44s -> 7482.88s]  That's just you
[7482.88s -> 7485.61s]  That's not quests
[7496.44s -> 7501.39s]  Forget the stream by tomorrow, dude
[7505.53s -> 7511.29s]  I'm trying to figure out if that's like some kind of an insult or if that's just your just like I don't really care
[7511.93s -> 7515.29s]  What is that? Is that what was that like an insult that sounded like an insult?
[7516.49s -> 7519.45s]  I don't think that's what it was though. I think it was just purely like I dude
[7519.45s -> 7522.41s]  I'm not gonna remember this tomorrow like you saying this shit
[7524.22s -> 7527.77s]  Was it an insult?
[7527.77s -> 7529.77s]  All right, be careful
[7530.09s -> 7544.94s]  All right, if you have a red nose
[7545.64s -> 7547.64s]  The left side
[7547.80s -> 7553.31s]  Is always safe. You have a red nose and you go on the right side. You will always die
[7554.11s -> 7555.79s]  Let's just get that out of the way
[7555.79s -> 7573.95s]  for the rest of you
[7573.95s -> 7576.43s]  Everybody else has to go this way, but we got to do this right
[7577.07s -> 7577.87s]  so
[7577.87s -> 7578.83s]  up

[7584.97s -> 7588.57s]  Eyes and the glasses so we want to do glasses first
[7588.73s -> 7595.78s]  First then these eyes then glasses and glasses
[7598.24s -> 7602.90s]  And eyes and glasses
[7607.23s -> 7609.23s]  Now everybody else should be safe
[7610.11s -> 7617.37s]  Yep, we're good. Oh, oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what'd I do?

[8788.03s -> 8790.32s]  But i'm gonna pick this one
[8790.32s -> 8796.17s]  You've been given the opportunity to choose one superpower to possess for 24 hours
[8796.17s -> 8801.64s]  You choose to go back in time to be invisible to be a speed reader
[8803.20s -> 8809.63s]  To fly or to be super why to be a speed reader who clicks that which what do you clicked on that one?

[8864.09s -> 8870.54s]  You go to an amusement park with the gang your favorite part of the whole day is
[8871.02s -> 8877.56s]  Crashing and smashing on the bumper boats screaming until your voice is gone on the scariest roller coasters

[8882.72s -> 8887.77s]  Taking pictures and just hanging out with your friends playing games and winning a stuffed animal for your crush
[8888.25s -> 8898.27s]  Now too much movement, especially if you've eaten during the day this one, but I don't screaming. No, I don't scream on it

[8980.72s -> 8988.78s]  You call her later to say you're an idiot and you're sorry call out her name and beckon for her to come over
[8990.01s -> 8994.06s]  Ask her to join you and apologize for forgetting her don't know what to do
[8994.06s -> 8996.06s]  She walks by and you just look the other way
[8999.13s -> 9009.48s]  Gasp and duck behind a display and stay hidden until she disappears. Well, there needs to be more context here

[9948.00s -> 9953.10s]  Something's wrong, okay, so it has to be mushrooms
[9967.46s -> 9969.46s]  Little pizza makers
[9969.94s -> 9972.15s]  There it is. All right. Good
[9972.15s -> 9974.15s]  So you do not want this
[9974.23s -> 9981.20s]  So we're gonna have to just go and there's no cheese option either. How about just how about we'll just go musk make it easy
[9982.82s -> 9985.81s]  Make it simple
[9996.32s -> 9998.32s]  What does do you just want a sauce pizza
[10005.04s -> 10008.80s]  More topping, okay. All right. All right. All right. So let's do
[10011.64s -> 10014.31s]  I think this is gonna be
[10014.31s -> 10017.80s]  Just punch me in the face
[10017.80s -> 10021.99s]  Just punch me in the face. He punched me in the face. Okay
[10031.22s -> 10034.16s]  More toppings
[10034.40s -> 10040.21s]  Oh
[10040.21s -> 10045.38s]  That's all right. Bye. Uh-oh
[10046.50s -> 10048.71s]  Okay
[10048.71s -> 10050.71s]  So you don't like mushrooms
[10051.51s -> 10056.96s]  This is the pizza that you want unless you don't want pineapple, but you want sprinkles on the ice cream
[10057.68s -> 10073.49s]  Their stuff I don't like you piece of shit. He's gonna kill somebody else. He's gonna kill another
[10078.10s -> 10080.10s]  Shit. All right. Well, we did it
[10084.39s -> 10088.39s]  Thank you. Thank you. It's all good
[10102.63s -> 10107.49s]  We lost two but that's we'll be fine
[10112.36s -> 10114.36s]  That was challenging
[10114.60s -> 10119.96s]  But you did it. You are a bright one. Oh shit. We can't go any we can't go forward
[10122.80s -> 10126.21s]  We have to store everybody I can't move forward without 16
[10135.40s -> 10148.98s]  Yeah, we gotta go back I can see how you shaped your personality. Yeah
[10153.72s -> 10164.68s]  What is this freakish little game? That's a weird way to put it
[10175.96s -> 10183.64s]  All right, let's go
[10183.64s -> 10189.72s]  How about here?
[10190.04s -> 10196.05s]  Is it glasses or I mean these are pretty much the same let's try glasses
[10197.40s -> 10199.40s]  Nope
[10199.80s -> 10201.80s]  It's probably hair or feet
[10202.44s -> 10214.77s]  Try hair. Well could be either one. Let's try feet. Okay, I think that's correct
[10219.67s -> 10220.55s]  Oh
[10220.55s -> 10226.48s]  Maybe it is hair
[10229.46s -> 10233.36s]  So, okay, it's hair is it hair though all the same shoes
[10235.54s -> 10247.52s]  Slow down slow down slow down slow down. I'm good. I got it. Okay
[10266.05s -> 10268.05s]  Okay, I hope I don't get this wrong because
[10269.57s -> 10282.63s]  Did you add that as an emote? That's fine. All right, you've done quite well
[10290.60s -> 10295.08s]  These stone guards have their rules so do proceed with skill
[10297.48s -> 10299.16s]  They're blue
[10299.16s -> 10305.68s]  What's the point of the game is to try to get as many zumbinis to the zumbini ville town without losing any of them
[10306.63s -> 10309.06s]  But you will
[10311.32s -> 10327.24s]  Chosen few let's go pink noses this way see if it works. Uh-huh blue. All right blue noses
[10330.82s -> 10332.82s]  one of the chosen
[10332.98s -> 10334.98s]  What about green noses this way?
[10341.40s -> 10348.07s]  All right, what about this way not all doors are open to you
[10354.16s -> 10357.60s]  This is almost the exact same character. So, uh
[10358.40s -> 10367.12s]  Let's just assume that this is gonna get through assume this one will get through as well. No
[10368.00s -> 10370.63s]  Those eyes away you go
[10371.80s -> 10377.06s]  It's not hair. It's not feet. It's not nose. It's eyes. Okay
[10383.01s -> 10384.45s]  Step right up
[10384.45s -> 10386.69s]  Any more glasses up this way?
[10387.24s -> 10388.84s]  Okay by me
[10388.84s -> 10390.28s]  Do go in
[10390.28s -> 10393.75s]  Okay
[10393.75s -> 10399.80s]  Step in why is this one over here? Oh blue nose, right? The blue nose does it?
[10405.01s -> 10416.66s]  Okay, I think they all just go this way. Yeah, we're good
[10422.34s -> 10428.65s]  Glad to drop in don't mess up the pizza stuff now
[10445.19s -> 10447.19s]  Make me a pizza
[10448.45s -> 10450.45s]  All right, same deal. We're gonna go just
[10450.45s -> 10452.45s]  like this
[10459.14s -> 10462.58s]  Some of those toppings are distasteful. They both don't like pineapple
[10463.62s -> 10465.70s]  They're both hyper intelligent beings
[10466.40s -> 10471.19s]  Hyper intelligence. All right, what about this?
[10478.55s -> 10484.88s]  Okay, there's something there I hate oh good. All right, so you both don't want that
[10484.88s -> 10487.44s]  So what about sprinkles and then we're gonna then we'll go forward from there
[10488.32s -> 10495.06s]  There's stuff on that. I don't like
[10496.68s -> 10500.60s]  More toppings. All right, so we gotta we're gonna do hers. Okay, here we go
[10502.56s -> 10506.71s]  So you both don't want pineapple? How about sprinkle and
[10508.87s -> 10512.90s]  Maybe she'll just want it
[10519.43s -> 10523.78s]  Okay, so you don't like any of this shit
[10530.23s -> 10539.92s]  Something on that I don't like do you want a plain pizza possible? Sometimes it happens
[10550.84s -> 10557.89s]  You might just want a plain sauce pizza well find out right now
[10566.85s -> 10568.85s]  And nobody had to die
[10578.56s -> 10584.95s]  Is it why are you moaning in the background? Where do you hear that?
[10585.19s -> 10587.19s]  Is that you
[10590.76s -> 10592.92s]  That was challenging
[10592.92s -> 10596.68s]  But you did it. You are a bright one
[10597.40s -> 10599.40s]  Yes, you are
[10599.72s -> 10601.72s]  I'm not going up until I have to
[10607.65s -> 10614.47s]  There's no this one might be my favorite game besides the pizza one
[10616.16s -> 10618.56s]  This is my favorite non pizza related minigame
[10627.73s -> 10629.73s]  any of these match
[10629.73s -> 10636.45s]  All right, so it's a green nose and that's it. So we single out the green noses
[10637.41s -> 10639.41s]  And this one looks very different
[10648.50s -> 10651.30s]  So it's the green nose this hair
[10652.90s -> 10657.06s]  and pink shoes green nose this hair
[10658.02s -> 10660.02s]  And this is it right here. No, it's not
[10660.26s -> 10662.26s]  Yes, it is
[10673.30s -> 10679.46s]  Breaking news germa's favorite non pizza related minigame revealed. I got deleted by nightbot. Sorry
[10680.76s -> 10684.12s]  You used too many capital letters. I think all right
[10684.12s -> 10687.67s]  Okay
[10687.67s -> 10694.63s]  So green nose
[10694.63s -> 10699.43s]  Different hair though this one
[10700.23s -> 10703.48s]  No
[10703.48s -> 10709.43s]  So it's pink shoes and green nose
[10709.99s -> 10714.02s]  this one
[10714.74s -> 10721.24s]  That is really loud for me. Hopefully it's not loud for you
[10722.12s -> 10734.79s]  This entire game is food mode
[10736.04s -> 10738.04s]  Yeah, that's fine
[10738.04s -> 10747.46s]  Let's just go for shoes
[10747.46s -> 10749.06s]  No
[10749.06s -> 10752.21s]  Is it glasses?
[10752.21s -> 10755.49s]  It might be nose or glasses. Let's try glasses with a different color nose
[10756.53s -> 10757.57s]  Oh
[10757.57s -> 10766.77s]  It's noses always do noses first. What the hell am I doing? Am I dumb? Am I am I dumb?
[10767.09s -> 10780.68s]  Why would I not start with noses? I love this song
[10806.71s -> 10810.07s]  Hey, you're ready to snooze dream a little dream
[10815.36s -> 10817.36s]  Gonna play final fantasy 16
[10817.52s -> 10821.46s]  I can tell you the answer to that question is yes
[10822.18s -> 10826.84s]  I'm gonna play it at launch and and guess what?
[10829.00s -> 10836.47s]  I'll be sponsored to play again. Let's fucking go
[10853.84s -> 10858.24s]  You love saying let's go no, I just think saying let's go makes me
[10859.06s -> 10862.71s]  More relatable. So I try to throw it in there every now and again
[10863.51s -> 10878.02s]  Is it working red?
[10878.82s -> 10883.94s]  uh triangle
[10884.42s -> 10892.56s]  Can you say let's go zoom beanie gang that is like a youtube video
[10893.12s -> 10899.06s]  I'm gonna do like a tuba intro. I could if you wanted to see
[10899.62s -> 10907.52s]  I just got this incredible urge for tabasco habanero sauce
[10908.08s -> 10910.08s]  Just I had this
[10910.14s -> 10917.08s]  Immediate urge to just eat it. It was immediate
[10920.93s -> 10923.30s]  pink circle
[10923.38s -> 10925.68s]  Wait, oh, I thought I clicked circle
[10929.89s -> 10931.89s]  All right circle
[10931.97s -> 10939.61s]  What is it pink star? No, it's pink triangle. No pink square
[10948.82s -> 10957.68s]  How do you pronounce this pico de gallo you can put your head down in shame now because you thought I was gonna say it wrong
[10966.47s -> 10968.71s]  All right blue diamond
[10970.07s -> 10971.43s]  No
[10971.43s -> 10973.43s]  Well blue star
[10974.23s -> 10984.77s]  Good blue circle. Did you want me to do like a hot sauce a hot sauce burn my whole face?
[10986.16s -> 10992.31s]  List. Oh, this one is so hot. You want to do that? I'll do it
[11017.08s -> 11019.08s]  You catch up is too hot for you
[11023.33s -> 11025.33s]  Actually, that's kind of true in a lot of cases
[11026.21s -> 11028.21s]  Ketchup can kind of be a little too much
[11028.98s -> 11035.17s]  Good work. Can you brave the challenges of not spicy but like annoying?
[11035.65s -> 11039.65s]  The new dangers of the mountains of despair
[11044.20s -> 11048.92s]  Not spicy i'm just saying ketchup ketchup can kind of be annoying on food sometimes
[11051.48s -> 11053.48s]  I wouldn't want ketchup on let's say
[11054.52s -> 11058.61s]  I'm trying to think of what like would be kind of geared on
[11059.25s -> 11061.81s]  the little too
[11062.69s -> 11068.69s]  Tangy and acidic strange carvings left. I'd say the same thing about a tabasco sauce
[11068.93s -> 11071.17s]  I wouldn't want that on everything. It's like a little too harsh
[11071.89s -> 11085.19s]  What is this even telling me these hair styles? I think these are hairstyles
[11105.99s -> 11111.30s]  Can you eat a carolina reaper hole on stream for the haters?
[11115.12s -> 11117.72s]  I would want to like
[11117.72s -> 11121.72s]  Eat a bowl of soup for the haters. You understand that that would make the haters happy
[11122.44s -> 11127.80s]  Why would I do that for the haters?
[11127.88s -> 11130.92s]  That would make the haters be very pleased
[11132.87s -> 11137.03s]  The haters would be very unhappy if I was just eating soup on stream and I was like having a good time and normal
[11137.35s -> 11142.13s]  What do you what do you mean for the haters?
[11142.13s -> 11144.13s]  Me being like
[11145.57s -> 11150.85s]  Like on stream is like yeah. Yeah, fuck you. I fucking hate you fucking I hate him like I hope he fucking gets hurt
[11151.41s -> 11164.84s]  I'm waiting for the haters
[11165.16s -> 11173.38s]  When you're gonna eat soup on stream, I don't know never you should stream soup then for the haters
[11174.18s -> 11184.55s]  Okay, I can't tell what hairstyle that is. All right
[11194.05s -> 11202.40s]  What about where where's the soup tier list I want to do the frozen food tier list
[11205.72s -> 11209.08s]  You know what let's just stop talking about it and get a crystal filter
[11209.64s -> 11211.64s]  Let's get it a plan for it
[11211.64s -> 11215.24s]  Here's what I want to do
[11215.24s -> 11221.17s]  I'll talk to the mods and we will get a system where we can figure out what the best
[11221.97s -> 11223.81s]  frozen foods are
[11223.81s -> 11226.76s]  I'll get a bunch of them
[11226.76s -> 11237.62s]  And we'll do it
[11237.62s -> 11243.24s]  We'll talk after the stream get some guys so you can recommend like oh, hey, you gotta get the like the stoffer is
[11244.12s -> 11246.12s]  fucking meat and potatoes meal
[11247.28s -> 11265.46s]  Right, you're never gonna do this. Oh, I will I will like tv dinner. Yeah
[11266.26s -> 11268.26s]  just like frozen meals
[11268.66s -> 11271.08s]  frozen foods
[11271.08s -> 11273.40s]  Maybe like three or four from each major brand
[11277.38s -> 11278.42s]  Okay, here's the thing
[11278.42s -> 11283.43s]  I want to make sure that I can take at least enough from each one
[11285.48s -> 11288.68s]  And to be able to save the rest of it to eat later or if it's gross, you know
[11288.68s -> 11313.25s]  Obviously not gonna keep it. I think frozen meals is where we start. Jimmy Dean breakfast bowl
[11314.20s -> 11319.44s]  Okay
[11319.44s -> 11323.49s]  Fish sticks when you can do the baby food tier list
[11324.64s -> 11326.72s]  Your microwave is going to be working over time
[11333.00s -> 11336.42s]  Can you explain this minigame for the haters? Um
[11340.56s -> 11342.88s]  Yeah, that's fine
[11342.88s -> 11345.35s]  so in this game mode
[11345.35s -> 11351.43s]  You have to match the zoom beanie with the one of the mirrors and there are five to six fake zoom beanies up here
[11351.75s -> 11356.18s]  To throw you off. So I have to take one of my zoom beanies
[11357.06s -> 11359.20s]  and
[11359.20s -> 11382.56s]  Match it to this one. I can't like do this
[11383.52s -> 11407.96s]  Why am I having so much trouble with this? Oh, I don't know this one. I don't know whether it's getting an exist up there
[11408.92s -> 11424.95s]  a lot of pink shoes
[11424.95s -> 11433.84s]  You seem to be really bad at bottle flipping
[11434.64s -> 11454.79s]  Yeah, I am. I don't actually I never even tried it. I might be good at it. I've never tried do a bottle flipping stream
[11458.64s -> 11466.20s]  Is this game an analogy for children's journey through life to reach god in eternal paradise?
[11470.08s -> 11473.04s]  um
[11473.04s -> 11477.68s]  Media you can interpret. Oh, you know certain ways. How have you, you know feel like you interpret the media?
[11479.17s -> 11481.17s]  I interpret this as
[11481.49s -> 11489.92s]  the struggle to relocate
[11489.92s -> 11496.80s]  the hardships that come with relocating
[11502.76s -> 11504.28s]  and man's
[11504.28s -> 11506.52s]  constant struggle
[11506.52s -> 11509.32s]  With who we are and what we're what we're doing on this planet
[11524.07s -> 11529.52s]  And our ability as humans to overcome anything
[11532.61s -> 11534.61s]  That's what I think it is. That's how I believe it is
[11545.59s -> 11547.11s]  No, it's not
[11547.11s -> 11551.83s]  Just a fun game for kids about matching puzzles
[11560.63s -> 11573.76s]  Dope you got that from chat gpt
[11577.08s -> 11580.12s]  Does chat gpt even know who the zoom beanies are?
[11580.92s -> 11591.99s]  You should ask it
[11591.99s -> 11594.47s]  I've never used chat gpt. I just hear about it
[11595.27s -> 11612.52s]  Do you want to know the fastest way to make me never do anything have the thing?
[11613.48s -> 11614.60s]  that
[11614.60s -> 11618.76s]  Is something that to use have any kind of account sign up beforehand?
[11619.80s -> 11621.48s]  And I just won't use it
[11621.48s -> 11628.74s]  Ever the zoom beanies are a fictional group of small blue creatures who star in a series of educational puzzle games
[11629.14s -> 11632.02s]  First game logical journey of the zoom beanies. Okay. Well, they know
[11632.82s -> 11634.82s]  It's just a search thing, isn't it?
[11647.96s -> 11652.68s]  It's not just a search thing. Well, I mean if you okay if you type into chat gpt, what are the zoom beanies?
[11653.08s -> 11655.32s]  It's going to find it. It's going to figure it out
[11656.02s -> 11663.64s]  You didn't write what are the zoom beanies favorite foods or like how do we stop the zoom beanies or?
[11664.28s -> 11666.28s]  That's you're asking it a very simple question
[11684.37s -> 11699.80s]  You stop by not playing you killed one what no I didn't
[11701.00s -> 11703.00s]  Oh shit, I killed one
[11703.08s -> 11705.82s]  I wasn't paying attention. I wasn't paying attention
[11710.92s -> 11713.40s]  I was looking over at chat. I was talking to you guys
[11714.28s -> 11727.30s]  I was talking to you guys. I wasn't even looking at the game. I was just hanging out
[11733.27s -> 11739.03s]  There is no need or reason to stop the zoom beanies as they are fictional characters from a series of education educational games
[11739.67s -> 11744.23s]  Some beanies exist solely within the context of those games and do not pose any real world threat
[11746.16s -> 11751.44s]  However, if you're referring to a specific challenge or obstacle within the zoom beanie games that you're having trouble with
[11751.84s -> 11755.36s]  I'd be happy to help you with strategies or solutions to overcome it
[11755.68s -> 11758.32s]  Just let me know which part you're struggling with and i'll do my best
[11774.02s -> 11778.34s]  All right, how many people there's like 17 000 people here you are training
[11779.14s -> 11781.78s]  You're training the language learning model right now
[11782.34s -> 11786.50s]  People are going to start getting zoom beanie lore in their random fucking generations
[11786.58s -> 11794.58s]  They do chat gpt is just going to think that the zoom beanies are incredibly important and to start putting them in other places
[11795.14s -> 11810.05s]  Well, they are important. So
[11810.53s -> 11830.87s]  I can't believe I killed one. Can you please turn on the mic camera?
[11835.70s -> 11842.12s]  I haven't showered today and i'm naked. So no search first
[11843.48s -> 11856.45s]  All right, let's do this one. This one is got shoes in the mix now
[11864.37s -> 11868.53s]  So if shoes go pink shoes go up this way, they always will bump that way
[11869.41s -> 11873.76s]  And then be safe if pink shoes go this way. They will always go this way
[11877.08s -> 11882.36s]  And then they always die. So if you have pink shoes, you have to go this way. There's no other option
[11892.02s -> 11897.06s]  Wait, yeah, okay. That's right
[11897.38s -> 11940.23s]  Okay, so now what so it doesn't really okay. What about hair?
[11941.25s -> 11944.05s]  So this hair is going to go up this way. It'll go all the way up
[11945.48s -> 11946.76s]  down
[11946.76s -> 11949.06s]  All right, so no matter what
[11949.06s -> 11951.22s]  Hair has to go this way
[11951.78s -> 11953.78s]  Wait, no, everybody dies if they go that way
[11954.26s -> 11962.71s]  They have to alternate so as it stands right now
[11963.35s -> 11965.11s]  This has to go
[11965.11s -> 11970.53s]  This is right. Wait, hold on
[11970.53s -> 11973.09s]  If you have one of these hairs you go up
[11975.33s -> 11983.97s]  Up into the right down up. All right, so hold on. I this i'm gonna fuck this up. I think this is great
[11983.97s -> 11985.17s]  I think this is correct
[11985.17s -> 11991.81s]  Can we play Vinnie in street fighter?
[11991.89s -> 11995.41s]  I mean, it would be an absolute fucking massacre. I don't know. I don't think that's a
[11996.29s -> 12005.83s]  Probably not a good idea
[12005.83s -> 12013.14s]  It would be an absolute massacre. I'm telling him you said that
[12015.92s -> 12017.92s]  I'm talking about me losing
[12018.68s -> 12023.32s]  Before you go tattle tail on me really
[12027.32s -> 12031.28s]  Wow, okay
[12031.28s -> 12035.68s]  All right. So now I have to go up right down up. Okay, so if I put
[12036.24s -> 12038.58s]  this person with his hair
[12038.58s -> 12039.94s]  that's correct
[12039.94s -> 12041.94s]  and we do the
[12041.94s -> 12046.53s]  This hair and this should be fine, right? I believe that's correct
[12047.01s -> 12051.94s]  Let's love to worry about this
[12051.94s -> 12053.30s]  so now
[12053.30s -> 12059.73s]  Okay, you can go
[12059.73s -> 12065.03s]  and then
[12065.03s -> 12079.94s]  I think I fucked it up
[12079.94s -> 12090.44s]  No, I got it
[12090.44s -> 12096.15s]  Game sounds are too loud. It might be one guy, but i'll do it. Is it a one guy?
[12096.63s -> 12125.72s]  I turned it down a little bit. Are you slippery on a milkshake? I wish
[12136.66s -> 12149.46s]  You're wearing a star wars shirt today. No, not today. Can we get to a hundred zoom beanies in zoom beanieville?
[12150.42s -> 12168.48s]  We're definitely gonna get to a hundred there's no way we won't oh what's this swimming pool
[12169.28s -> 12183.65s]  They got a pool now
[12183.65s -> 12203.96s]  Okay, things have gotten harder this way. There's 60 here. Okay. Let me ask you
[12204.36s -> 12207.00s]  Should we continue to do just the journey and bring more people?
[12207.48s -> 12210.44s]  Or do you want to see how hard this game is because we've been playing it for three hours
[12210.76s -> 12221.08s]  What do you think let's get a pull-up you want to do the hard stuff and we'll play some hard minigames and then
[12221.64s -> 12235.38s]  See where we are journey or go to hard i'm seeing a lot of hard
[12235.78s -> 12247.43s]  Yeah, this is actually almost impossible for me on some of these you wouldn't last a day on hard
[12247.59s -> 12255.28s]  I know I I won't they're actually really hard. All right, so we'll let's do
[12256.18s -> 12261.22s]  Very very hard for pizza because everyone wants to see that. Let's go
[12269.65s -> 12271.89s]  So there are three
[12271.97s -> 12278.87s]  You won't last a minute playing this game on hard
[12282.00s -> 12283.62s]  That's not what you said
[12283.62s -> 12289.51s]  Oops, okay. So
[12291.72s -> 12293.72s]  We already have some things they don't like
[12295.00s -> 12303.40s]  I don't know if it's cheese sometimes hard to tell so somebody doesn't like mushrooms
[12304.26s -> 12310.48s]  Sprinkles or cheese i'm gonna go pineapple plain
[12311.44s -> 12316.63s]  go
[12319.32s -> 12321.32s]  I'd appreciate more toppings. Okay
[12323.56s -> 12328.55s]  All right, so let's work on hers so we got pineapple
[12329.41s -> 12332.61s]  And cheese is that is that good?
[12341.64s -> 12345.16s]  Getting there gee I wasn't expecting that one
[12352.23s -> 12354.23s]  So they all don't like sprinkles apparently
[12355.16s -> 12357.16s]  Because she likes cheese
[12361.28s -> 12368.04s]  So she doesn't want sprinkles. What about a cherry?
[12381.24s -> 12384.68s]  All right expecting that one so you all right
[12386.92s -> 12390.95s]  All right. All right
[12391.43s -> 12399.30s]  It's not pepperoni it could be mushrooms
[12412.61s -> 12414.61s]  Little pizza makers
[12419.24s -> 12421.09s]  So
[12421.09s -> 12424.53s]  What do they actually want? Let's just go chocolate sauce
[12429.72s -> 12431.72s]  more toppings start
[12431.96s -> 12432.76s]  Oh
[12432.76s -> 12435.80s]  Something's wrong. Okay. Well, I don't care. I got one
[12441.57s -> 12443.33s]  Okay, so
[12443.33s -> 12455.51s]  I don't he didn't like cheese did he doesn't want pepperoni doesn't want sprinkles. He didn't like the pineapple
[12455.59s -> 12459.35s]  Okay. Wait, what about the mushrooms down here? What about cheese and mushrooms and shit?
[12462.96s -> 12468.45s]  Didn't he not like cheese?
[12468.61s -> 12481.28s]  No, he didn't like cheese something on that's not good for me. Okay. I don't think he likes cheese
[12488.08s -> 12494.45s]  That's gonna be it
[12495.01s -> 12497.25s]  What?
[12504.82s -> 12514.20s]  What the hell do you want do you just what something's wrong
[12514.28s -> 12516.42s]  Wrong
[12516.42s -> 12518.42s]  Do you just want a cherry?
[12518.58s -> 12524.72s]  This is a fucked up meal
[12527.12s -> 12530.00s]  Well, maybe not. I actually think a tomato based pie. No
[12530.72s -> 12535.57s]  Something on that's not good for me. What does he want?
[12545.06s -> 12554.56s]  Doesn't want cherry doesn't like peppers doesn't like mushrooms doesn't want cheese. Is it pineapple? Didn't he say?
[12555.52s -> 12559.83s]  Yuck. No, he doesn't like anything. Maybe it's just cheese
[12571.01s -> 12572.29s]  Oh
[12572.29s -> 12579.33s]  Kill the log
[12579.33s -> 12585.20s]  All right. So you want pepperoni and chocolate sauce? That should be it
[12586.98s -> 12590.76s]  Yep
[12592.07s -> 12602.12s]  I've no idea what this guy wants. I don't think he wants any ice cream stuff
[12611.08s -> 12613.32s]  Let's check it
[12613.32s -> 12623.59s]  I have three or I feel like four more more please. Okay, you want sprinkles. Why do you uh,
[12624.15s -> 12632.08s]  Hey you that you liked it. That was a that was a happy punch to the face. Okay, whatever
[12637.49s -> 12639.49s]  No cheese. I don't think he wants cheese
[12639.49s -> 12646.87s]  Sprinkles and cheese is here and it's down here. No mushrooms either sprinkles and mushrooms and he's like get that shit out of here
[12647.68s -> 12653.89s]  So what about um pepperoni?
[12660.79s -> 12663.75s]  Gee, I wasn't expecting that one
[12677.14s -> 12679.32s]  Thank you, yes
[12686.96s -> 12692.93s]  Oh that one on the right was pretty doughy that one on the right did not look very good
[12701.44s -> 12703.41s]  Cool. All right
[12703.41s -> 12715.96s]  So, can I show you how hard this is on very hard? I don't even know why I don't know what this is
[12720.74s -> 12722.74s]  Okay, so because there's
[12733.68s -> 12735.49s]  uh
[12735.49s -> 12738.44s]  All right pac-man. No
[12740.00s -> 12744.72s]  Pac-man. No pac-man has nothing this
[12745.44s -> 12747.44s]  Can go down down
[12748.10s -> 12756.61s]  No, nothing. This can go. No, nothing. It's gonna go right. Nothing
[12758.29s -> 12762.64s]  This can go nothing
[12762.64s -> 12763.60s]  uh
[12763.60s -> 12766.42s]  This can go blue
[12767.30s -> 12770.98s]  Um
[12770.98s -> 12773.30s]  Wait, they're changing them. Do you see what's happening?
[12773.86s -> 12782.63s]  What see how fucked up this is look at what's happening. This is uh, I don't I can't even do it
[12782.71s -> 12796.61s]  I can't do it use the magic wand to do what I have to go really fast
[12797.40s -> 12801.35s]  I can't I can't look at it. I actually can't look at it. Watch this one
[12803.84s -> 12809.97s]  Those of you that thought this was a kid's game. Good luck because uh
[12811.59s -> 12818.18s]  Okay, let's try to get one person across so if this one goes up
[12818.50s -> 12824.55s]  It's gonna go up. I don't know what this is. We have to test it. What does this do?
[12825.11s -> 12835.22s]  Is it a teleporter?
[12835.22s -> 12837.22s]  No, it freezes them in place
[12839.24s -> 12843.48s]  So this is gonna go up and then a red I need another red nose to bump
[12855.80s -> 12863.16s]  Why would anybody get sent up here?
[12863.16s -> 12866.92s]  Uh
[12866.92s -> 12882.20s]  Wait, what? Okay. If I go everybody has to go this way. Oh, wait a minute. I can bump you this way
[12885.51s -> 12895.46s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, no. Um, oh, there's another path to wait
[12897.40s -> 12920.08s]  What i'm not gonna be able to do it. I don't I don't think I can do it. It's too hard
[12920.32s -> 12927.94s]  It's not even too hard. It's just too much my brain to look at I have to get one person over there
[12928.26s -> 12940.82s]  How do we even go this way? I think this is just death for every single character
[12941.14s -> 12960.80s]  I mean not really how to because that's changing this to go that way
[12962.58s -> 12977.97s]  Now this one wants to go up if it goes up. It'll hit the green marker hit the green and then it's stuck here
[12978.61s -> 12984.26s]  This made this one turn right so this one now is gonna go right right if you have one eye
[12984.82s -> 12989.40s]  Which will make you go this way then up got it
[12990.04s -> 12992.24s]  We're gonna save at least one person
[12992.24s -> 13022.34s]  Because now I can focus on the green and glasses. I can't I don't want to look at it anymore. Check this one out
[13027.33s -> 13034.85s]  I actually really like this one. This one is fun to do. So let's go. Let's just start blue square blue interior
[13039.01s -> 13039.97s]  blue
[13039.97s -> 13046.04s]  Square red interior blue yellow interior
[13048.80s -> 13050.92s]  all right, so what
[13050.92s -> 13078.52s]  Does this mean this is yellow internal square is up here red internal square is here red internal square with blue
[13080.52s -> 13081.96s]  with a star
[13081.96s -> 13083.96s]  Oh, that was so completely wrong
[13087.04s -> 13091.33s]  triangle
[13091.33s -> 13100.13s]  Each one of these is it's okay. Hold on. So it will be green with a square. Okay
[13103.81s -> 13106.16s]  the square
[13106.24s -> 13117.16s]  Red interior square triangle. No shit. It's not a red interior square
[13121.20s -> 13124.37s]  pink
[13124.37s -> 13126.37s]  red interior square
[13126.83s -> 13140.21s]  Yellow
[13140.21s -> 13148.52s]  Get this guy some lithium. Remember we don't get this game. Let me help you
[13149.67s -> 13155.27s]  So I have to pick a color the color is corresponding to a space on this board
[13155.99s -> 13160.55s]  The square the shape is corresponding to a space on this board. You get it
[13165.04s -> 13167.52s]  So all red interior
[13168.26s -> 13174.26s]  Shapes are this row you see what's happening all blue
[13174.80s -> 13180.85s]  Interior shapes are on this row all yellow interior shapes are on this row
[13184.44s -> 13190.55s]  So to get this it is a red interior shape. We have not seen circle
[13191.11s -> 13192.93s]  So let's try it
[13192.93s -> 13195.25s]  Okay
[13195.25s -> 13197.89s]  So this is a circle. This is a circle with a green
[13198.67s -> 13206.80s]  exterior
[13206.80s -> 13208.80s]  You couldn't possibly know that I do
[13209.20s -> 13214.39s]  So the problem is not knowing
[13214.79s -> 13216.48s]  what
[13216.48s -> 13219.20s]  Interior color this is i'm gonna say pink
[13221.44s -> 13237.41s]  Okay, i'm almost out of power. Fuck you. Why is that over there?
[13242.08s -> 13243.92s]  Fuck you. What?
[13243.92s -> 13261.33s]  I want let me restart. Let me restart. I'm going to try again. What are you gonna do et atari?
[13264.28s -> 13281.80s]  I don't know. We have to get a center. So this is interior yellow triangle interior pink triangle
[13288.62s -> 13290.45s]  interior
[13290.45s -> 13291.97s]  pink triangle
[13292.05s -> 13294.39s]  red
[13294.39s -> 13296.39s]  interior pink triangle green
[13298.39s -> 13301.38s]  interior
[13301.38s -> 13306.69s]  pineapple
[13306.69s -> 13310.61s]  interior pink triangle yellow outside
[13312.08s -> 13317.88s]  star
[13317.88s -> 13320.36s]  Interior pink triangle yellow outside
[13330.76s -> 13347.08s]  Wait, i'm confusing myself. I just had it. I just hold on. I had it restart. Okay
[13355.97s -> 13372.31s]  Okay, the rules change every time you restart. Are you serious? Oh fuck. Okay, that's why I was screwed
[13372.39s -> 13379.44s]  All right. All right. All right. I'll get it. I'll get it. I get it pink interior
[13380.52s -> 13385.22s]  Red triangle red interior red triangle
[13386.10s -> 13390.52s]  Looks like it goes this way blue interior
[13392.04s -> 13394.04s]  Okay, good guy
[13394.28s -> 13402.85s]  Here we go. So that means that this is red. Would this be all red?
[13404.34s -> 13407.79s]  exterior red exterior
[13408.37s -> 13409.89s]  red
[13409.89s -> 13412.24s]  star
[13412.24s -> 13420.16s]  shit
[13420.16s -> 13421.44s]  Wait, what?
[13421.44s -> 13437.91s]  Why would that not be in here?
[13437.91s -> 13441.36s]  Exterior is the columns. So what about blue?
[13442.32s -> 13446.63s]  I dude I had it I had it and I just like fucked it all up
[13447.40s -> 13452.31s]  Interior is the line this time shit. I like okay
[13452.39s -> 13457.08s]  You know when you when you have something in your brain and then you you think about it more than once
[13457.48s -> 13462.98s]  And then it just completely disappears and it's as if you've never played it before it's just gone
[13463.46s -> 13469.09s]  Just it's gone like oh pink interior a red exterior shape
[13469.81s -> 13492.71s]  Is in this column in this row. Well, i'll try it again one more time. It was a good guess
[13497.08s -> 13500.28s]  So they're both squares they're both blue exteriors
[13500.92s -> 13503.32s]  The only difference is their interior is a different color
[13503.88s -> 13510.79s]  So what does that mean? Why is that on a different? Why is this in a different spot? I'm going to try something here
[13511.70s -> 13513.70s]  What is blue exterior?
[13514.47s -> 13516.90s]  square
[13516.90s -> 13538.95s]  Green interior. Oh, yeah, so all squares are here in this zone
[13541.20s -> 13543.20s]  all squares
[13543.20s -> 13545.00s]  In this zone
[13545.00s -> 13558.52s]  No, all blue exterior is this zone wait that might be right i'll test it one more time
[13562.26s -> 13565.80s]  Okay
[13565.80s -> 13571.14s]  So i'm imagining this is all green. This is all blue. This is all red. So this is all blue
[13572.53s -> 13573.81s]  blue
[13573.81s -> 13580.24s]  Interior no shit. Don't nobody stop talking. Hold on. Wait, this is oh i've had it. I lost it. Where's it?
[13580.87s -> 13592.37s]  This is blue. Yeah, i'm losing it. Stop just sit down for a second blue interior blue exterior blue interior
[13592.85s -> 13595.89s]  Is this so this is not star. Let's try circle
[13605.57s -> 13613.12s]  What this is all blue interior?
[13614.68s -> 13617.56s]  What diamond god damn it
[13620.98s -> 13624.05s]  star
[13624.05s -> 13633.73s]  All right. I got it now. I actually I have the pattern. I have the pattern so this means this is this is blue exterior
[13636.84s -> 13637.80s]  Okay
[13637.80s -> 13647.44s]  Blue exterior. It's not green, but it's a square. I guess we'll try pink
[13649.19s -> 13651.59s]  What i'm so confused. No
[13652.32s -> 13653.68s]  Okay, it's
[13653.68s -> 13660.47s]  Green that it has no the yellow interior
[13661.78s -> 13663.54s]  no
[13663.54s -> 13665.81s]  What the hell is this?
[13665.81s -> 13670.95s]  yellow
[13670.95s -> 13673.03s]  square
[13673.03s -> 13682.00s]  Okay, this is a the shapes don't match up. So this is a yellow interior
[13683.20s -> 13691.52s]  It's what that does not match up though
[13693.96s -> 13700.31s]  All right. Good luck trying to figure out the rest of this shit. It's not fucking hard
[13701.94s -> 13703.78s]  It's not hard
[13703.78s -> 13714.84s]  Jerma, it's called a pattern. I just got to recognize it and figure it out
[13715.52s -> 13720.15s]  And it's not even really a pattern because look at this like these shapes are not even in the right order here
[13721.09s -> 13729.83s]  This should be a square. This is not this is completely different in each row. So sit down relax
[13730.31s -> 13756.07s]  Hey, sit down. It's going diagonally. You spoken crack. All right, so let's drive red
[13756.87s -> 13758.79s]  Let's see where this goes
[13758.79s -> 13760.66s]  Okay
[13760.66s -> 13765.08s]  Red so I need red exterior
[13767.39s -> 13768.53s]  square
[13768.53s -> 13786.26s]  Is here with a blue interior circle
[13791.04s -> 13799.83s]  I do blue interior. What does it go? Where does this go? Is it going to be?
[13806.40s -> 13811.09s]  All right. So this is this matches so it does match
[13813.20s -> 13820.05s]  I didn't know if it was going to be scrambled in every single one of these quadrants. Okay, so go diagonal
[13824.15s -> 13829.38s]  So this is a no no, this is not I do this
[13831.25s -> 13833.25s]  the red exterior
[13834.07s -> 13837.81s]  shit
[13837.81s -> 13839.81s]  A red triangle then
[13839.81s -> 13841.81s]  Okay, so red triangle will do that
[13842.21s -> 13856.92s]  Can I have the controller you can download the game?
[13862.47s -> 13867.12s]  I'm sorry. I'm already out of juice. I might accidentally get like two of these. Let's see
[13871.01s -> 13877.41s]  So I don't know what the leftmost thing is. Okay, so hold on. What is that? I have not figured that out
[13877.81s -> 13886.04s]  What is this one? I have not figured that out. This is a square. So this is a square. It is a
[13887.09s -> 13895.25s]  Interior blue square and the color is we don't have any idea
[13905.57s -> 13909.30s]  green
[13909.30s -> 13912.85s]  What is here?
[13912.85s -> 13914.29s]  It has to be
[13914.29s -> 13921.38s]  You don't have any mud left. No
[13922.10s -> 13924.10s]  Okay, so green exterior
[13927.51s -> 13931.76s]  No, I want to do
[13931.76s -> 13936.18s]  Circle what color inside red?
[13939.25s -> 13947.72s]  Yep, i'm out of juice. I stopped paying attention to the puzzle. I feel so lost
[13951.20s -> 13957.65s]  Is there another shot left? I'm able to get the last at least two people. I got one shot left
[13957.89s -> 13964.12s]  All right, so this is either yellow or pink. Oh, no, I lose
[13971.86s -> 13972.90s]  Okay
[13972.90s -> 13975.59s]  Check this one out on hard
[13978.58s -> 13990.07s]  We're going on tour, but thanks to you good luck. This place has grown can't drop down right now
[13990.15s -> 13998.31s]  But a half it's better than having none. Okay, I don't I don't even I don't know what they want me to do
[14001.04s -> 14004.31s]  But i'm gonna just put people in places
[14008.32s -> 14018.82s]  This shouldn't even be that hard. What about noses? But can't I just put everybody in an individual room?
[14020.23s -> 14043.16s]  There are more doors than zumbinis. They have to go in a specific spot green noses the door pattern
[14045.01s -> 14055.40s]  mmm door pattern and the floor pattern so that would be
[14056.13s -> 14086.45s]  Uh to make me cry if I was playing this by myself. I don't I just genuinely don't really know
[14094.36s -> 14112.07s]  And I I already lost right springs. Um, well at least one person survived
[14118.45s -> 14124.42s]  Somebody said this one feels legit impossible. I don't think it is. I think but maybe it is
[14124.42s -> 14129.41s]  I don't know. Let's do the fleeing one. Let's see how much different difficult this one is
[14131.88s -> 14133.88s]  Because how much harder could you possibly make this one?
[14137.48s -> 14147.56s]  It might be opposites
[14147.56s -> 14153.20s]  All right, so let's just go by what we know the hair is all this stuff is wrong
[14153.92s -> 14167.96s]  None of this matches. Let's just put another random person that it has nothing in common with you. Okay
[14168.52s -> 14184.31s]  Do the glasses match?
[14184.31s -> 14190.71s]  Pink nose. Okay. Hold on. So red nose is purple nose. Maybe red nose and glasses. Do I have one?
[14194.98s -> 14196.98s]  I don't have a red nose and glasses
[14197.06s -> 14216.84s]  What the hell is this criteria spring is high heel bike is also high heel
[14219.97s -> 14231.25s]  Yellow nose is also purple nose as well as red nose. What about you? No you
[14231.73s -> 14259.08s]  Okay, it's the hat one two three hats left. Are there three of these hairs left one two
[14259.64s -> 14266.20s]  Three there is all right
[14266.20s -> 14274.48s]  Um, the glasses are the feet. Oh, that's true
[14278.76s -> 14283.38s]  so glass so eyes are feet so that means that
[14285.14s -> 14293.80s]  Hurts my head eyes are this so cyclops. I will just see what this does
[14297.01s -> 14301.04s]  No
[14301.04s -> 14302.80s]  Okay. Well eyes
[14302.80s -> 14308.26s]  So this is a a cyclops. There's only one cyclops left. It has to be this one
[14310.28s -> 14314.80s]  Right. I think so
[14314.80s -> 14325.94s]  Yep, his feet hair
[14328.45s -> 14331.01s]  Noses eyes eyes his feet hair his nose
[14331.65s -> 14343.35s]  Noses eyes
[14343.35s -> 14346.21s]  What is hair?
[14346.21s -> 14360.82s]  Beat his hair. So it's one of these four. Okay, so feet is
[14361.54s -> 14369.17s]  So it's not this one. Wait, maybe it is this one. It's this one, right?
[14372.37s -> 14382.36s]  Oh fuck
[14383.24s -> 14390.56s]  Yeah, it's that one okay and then it's this one
[14391.60s -> 14393.60s]  All right. Well, okay. That was hard
[14403.16s -> 14407.30s]  Cool. What else do we try very very hard?
[14408.39s -> 14410.39s]  What is this one on very hard?
[14411.51s -> 14414.63s]  Uh, it doesn't tell you you just have to figure it out. All right, let's start with you
[14415.75s -> 14418.93s]  now
[14418.93s -> 14420.93s]  How about um spring?
[14425.00s -> 14427.24s]  What about uh yellow nose and spring?
[14427.96s -> 14432.88s]  It's probably hair
[14432.88s -> 14435.36s]  I think it's hair
[14435.36s -> 14438.07s]  It's not hair
[14438.07s -> 14442.12s]  Is it eyes?
[14442.12s -> 14448.61s]  It's not eyes
[14448.61s -> 14452.23s]  Is it noses?
[14452.23s -> 14466.34s]  What is it? Is it feet? I think it is feet
[14467.14s -> 14468.58s]  Whoa, what?
[14468.58s -> 14492.05s]  What do you mean? Wait, wait, what why did that not happen? What is going on? Oh, they're all locked
[14496.28s -> 14508.98s]  Blue should wait hold because this sorting by multiple traits at once or by feet then eyes, etc. Okay, that's hard
[14511.09s -> 14517.88s]  What about this one? Wait, what?
[14518.68s -> 14521.03s]  Okay
[14521.03s -> 14532.68s]  What are we doing? Uh
[14534.47s -> 14540.05s]  Huh
[14540.05s -> 14546.95s]  They're changing so I have to match this one. I can I have to so I need a spring
[14552.12s -> 14553.80s]  No, I want this to be a spring
[14553.80s -> 14581.08s]  How do I get that to be a spring pass through the ice that matches them? I have to match in the middle
[14583.49s -> 14585.57s]  What the fuck? Okay. Um
[14588.98s -> 14593.17s]  Dude, i'm not doing this one. I don't care
[14594.24s -> 14598.07s]  It's too much
[14598.07s -> 14600.85s]  Uh, what about this one?
[14602.44s -> 14604.44s]  Yikes, no fucking way
[14606.08s -> 14617.44s]  Not a chance i'm doing this one. I'll give it a real try but no I can't I can't even look at it
[14620.18s -> 14632.15s]  Huh? This is not wait. They all have to be connected. I can't do it. What about this one?
[14634.52s -> 14640.08s]  This one might not be that bad
[14640.96s -> 14649.08s]  Okay, so they have to share
[14650.92s -> 14652.92s]  They have to share a trait with
[14653.08s -> 14660.68s]  Somebody that in adjacent to them, right? So you have to go here. This is gonna be a nightmare, but i'll try
[14660.68s -> 14673.35s]  Oh, you got it. They have to share some kind of trait. What's wrong the shoes the shoes match
[14673.75s -> 14684.24s]  There's a page on making an algorithm to solve this specific puzzle on zoom beanies. By the way, what?
[14688.53s -> 14690.71s]  Dude, how about this?
[14690.71s -> 14701.62s]  Try to do one for 30 minutes and we'll gamble that's a long time 30 minutes sub only
[14702.96s -> 14704.72s]  30 minutes that's
[14704.72s -> 14708.00s]  That sounds boring. That sounds really boring
[14709.75s -> 14717.78s]  That's like a third that's like 20 of this whole stream so far making an hour. No, that'd be horrible
[14718.26s -> 14729.40s]  How about 10 minutes 15 minutes 15 minutes? Can I complete this in 15 minutes what i'm looking at right now?
[14729.48s -> 14750.66s]  I'm getting bored 15 minutes the deal do one that you're at least comfortable with
[14756.16s -> 14759.60s]  I think I could do that one. It's gonna be kind of hard but I could do it
[14759.92s -> 14769.56s]  So this one again is if they have to share a trait with whoever's adjacent to them
[14771.01s -> 14782.31s]  Yeah, put it in emote only 15 minutes. You got it. I'll try you'd better beat it
[14782.39s -> 14786.44s]  I'm I can't tell you that's gonna happen in five minutes
[14786.44s -> 14788.68s]  I might realize I can't do this and get up and go get like a snack
[14790.87s -> 14792.87s]  Just be aware of what you're betting on here
[14793.11s -> 14800.56s]  This is very very hard zumbini's logical journey this shit is not for kids kids can't do this
[14800.88s -> 14807.65s]  This is not even for adults computers have problems doing this they made an algorithm to try to beat this game on very very hard
[14808.76s -> 14828.39s]  And that even struggled so just make sure you understand what you're betting on. All right, ready and go 15 minutes
[14831.76s -> 14833.76s]  All right, let's go
[14833.76s -> 14835.76s]  Looking
[14841.52s -> 14853.57s]  What do I have the most of this hair there you go, you got it
[14863.08s -> 14866.98s]  What's the matter, uh
[14876.07s -> 14879.27s]  Why not
[14880.79s -> 14888.69s]  He just drowned that person why not is it only based on hair
[14891.09s -> 14893.09s]  Hold on nose. Wait
[14893.25s -> 14896.76s]  It's got to match everybody so I need
[14934.47s -> 14942.34s]  Oh fuck
[14963.03s -> 14967.09s]  You cannot help me with emotes it's not gonna work this isn't breath of the wild
[14977.35s -> 14983.41s]  Nope, what do you mean? No, why not glasses shoot? What what?
[14985.48s -> 15001.33s]  All this dickhead down here
[15003.46s -> 15011.64s]  I screwed up so bad. I need to go buy feet and hair and nose
[15012.20s -> 15071.67s]  And eyes, this is impossible. There you go. You got i'm going i'm going
[15076.61s -> 15104.08s]  Uh, how much time do I have left? It's been five minutes already. What?
[15105.68s -> 15123.43s]  All right, i'm gonna lock in I have so many of these pink shoes
[15123.43s -> 15136.02s]  I don't know what to do with them eyes and hair eyes and hair eyes and hair hair and eyes and nose
[15138.95s -> 15141.57s]  Okay eyes
[15142.56s -> 15143.84s]  nose
[15143.84s -> 15148.47s]  hair, okay eyes
[15149.84s -> 15152.07s]  nose
[15152.07s -> 15155.96s]  hair
[15155.96s -> 15160.79s]  eyes
[15160.79s -> 15174.08s]  Oh
[15174.08s -> 15182.23s]  This is close. Okay, if I move the one to the left and switch it with somebody with shoes, hold on
[15188.74s -> 15194.76s]  Why no I can I can I can yes I can
[15212.92s -> 15216.28s]  It's so close and I just I need to move like one person
[15223.97s -> 15227.03s]  Uh
[15227.03s -> 15236.98s]  Who needs to move to make this right pointing at me outy. What does that mean?
[15238.66s -> 15251.78s]  You trying to tell me something sunglasses down hair left eyes up. Wait if I
[15271.12s -> 15297.11s]  Gg gg gg not yet. There you go. You got it. What why?
[15297.75s -> 15306.84s]  No, what are you talking about? What? Oh, i'm very confused right now. Explain this pink shoes pink shoes to the left
[15307.65s -> 15311.89s]  Uh the eyes that are kind of half closed down eyes that are half closed
[15312.37s -> 15340.63s]  Oh the person on the right. Yeah, there's only two. Come on. I can do it. No, I wanted to put you there
[15351.89s -> 15365.80s]  Time seven minutes. There you go. You got it. Shit
[15387.09s -> 15394.07s]  I need to rethink this
[15394.55s -> 15402.21s]  It's just like it's like four distinct different variables to be aware of i'm so close, but i'm so far away
[15414.00s -> 15424.12s]  For the two of you why?
[15447.89s -> 15452.55s]  I can't do it. I can't do it. It's just it's so tricky
[15452.63s -> 15459.73s]  It's a lot of it's a lot of ifs thens or buts and then there's a lot of moving. It's huh
[15460.13s -> 15467.80s]  I got five minutes. Hold on. I didn't put any springs down. Oh
[15495.25s -> 15497.40s]  Not this one
[15497.40s -> 15500.92s]  But wait, no it
[15502.87s -> 15515.56s]  I think I lose. Sorry everybody. I was like I can do it green nose green nose. Wait, hold on
[15517.00s -> 15522.74s]  Green green green
[15522.74s -> 15524.40s]  and then
[15524.40s -> 15533.52s]  No, and then no, I need a different nose. I need a different nose to go here. We're in a different nose
[15538.34s -> 15556.68s]  Our computer had prob they made a computer program and it didn't do it. This is so hard
[15566.98s -> 15570.98s]  Everybody has to have something in common with everybody next to them and it's just like hurting my head
[15592.05s -> 15595.25s]  Nope, no, but it's always always a problem
[15597.89s -> 15606.13s]  It's a it's always a problem see because like there's always somebody that doesn't match there. You got it. It's always a problem
[15614.21s -> 15629.04s]  Okay, hold on there. You got it
[15650.12s -> 15655.51s]  I think it was a it was a good attempt. It was a pretty good attempt. I think it's over though
[15655.75s -> 15680.26s]  I think this is far too difficult. It's not over yet. Hold on. No
[15685.38s -> 15691.57s]  Shit, i'm not happy right now. I'm very unhappy. No, what do you mean? No?
[15702.29s -> 15703.65s]  30 seconds
[15703.65s -> 15709.01s]  Nope, can't do that. I lose it. It's over. I just end it. I lose it's over. I can't do it
[15713.88s -> 15716.10s]  I can't do it
[15716.10s -> 15718.34s]  It's over. I I can't do it and it
[15718.34s -> 15720.77s]  It's I just can't do it
[15720.77s -> 15725.86s]  Let him out let him out of emote only I came kind of close but not really it's like a rubik's cube
[15726.34s -> 15728.42s]  Where somebody's probably just like oh dude, it's so easy
[15728.42s -> 15733.06s]  Just put the green guy over there and then put the fucking purple guy right here and put the blue guy over here
[15733.30s -> 15743.32s]  It's so simple
[15743.32s -> 15750.13s]  Hard sorry everybody you fucked me bro. I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you already
[15754.87s -> 15756.87s]  Can I do the pizza one? I'm very very hard
[15758.31s -> 15763.91s]  Bet on me. This is my game. This is my game. This is my game right here
[15765.06s -> 15768.29s]  Another bet 10 minutes. This is my game
[15779.92s -> 15781.92s]  I did it before you watched me do it before
[15782.40s -> 15794.13s]  How could you make it up to my grandma? Huh? She went all in she has nothing now your grandmother
[15794.77s -> 15797.57s]  Probably has like 12 channel points on this stream
[15798.92s -> 15803.88s]  She probably opened it was checking in to see what her grandson or granddaughter was up to
[15805.12s -> 15808.10s]  And closed it in five minutes. So
[15810.31s -> 15819.30s]  Okay, we ready
[15819.30s -> 15821.06s]  Have faith in me with the pizza mini game
[15821.06s -> 15826.10s]  I'm telling you you I just did it on very very very very very very very very very very very very very very hard already
[15826.95s -> 15854.34s]  I got it. I got it. Why do you play puzzle games on stream? You don't like it chat doesn't like it
[15854.42s -> 15862.39s]  I don't like it. Can you just go back to playing ass fart simulator? I mean, I like it. I think one of my favorite games
[15867.27s -> 15873.43s]  I love how you're separated from that. You don't like it chat doesn't like it. I don't like it
[15874.20s -> 15883.75s]  Aren't you a part of chat? How come you're separating yourself from chat? You're in chat
[15887.56s -> 15894.64s]  You know, you don't like it. I love this. I love this pizza game. All right, we ready
[15894.96s -> 15902.24s]  I hope you bet on me because i'm gonna make you a lot of channel points if you did in three
[15902.88s -> 15905.06s]  Two one go
[15911.08s -> 15915.01s]  Good toppings are distasteful where it doesn't matter
[15916.93s -> 15924.15s]  That's fine. We already know we're going for the uh, we're going for the trunk right here. Okay trunk
[15925.11s -> 15928.40s]  Very much would have been happy about this does not want
[15929.42s -> 15934.26s]  jalapenos jalapenos, I know how to say it. Why did I just say it weirdly? Let's go like this
[15940.77s -> 15944.85s]  No cheese got it. There's something there. I'll remake it. I'll remake it
[15945.33s -> 15947.33s]  I'll give you a refund. Just give it back
[15956.16s -> 15961.08s]  So you don't want cheese you don't want peppers. Do you want pineapple?
[15970.48s -> 15973.60s]  Those of you that have just lost a shitload of channel points, I just want to say
[15974.48s -> 15979.52s]  How could you have possibly bet against me in my favorite mini game in my favorite game of all time?
[15982.77s -> 15988.60s]  I'm just shocked really I am
[15988.60s -> 15990.10s]  Okay
[15990.10s -> 15992.10s]  What about just sprinkles?
[15993.28s -> 16002.84s]  Something on that's not good for me
[16003.24s -> 16017.32s]  Okay, well i'm gonna do something here that it might be a little unorthodox and it was because I didn't even look
[16026.52s -> 16029.48s]  Yeah, that's really unorthodox to a point where it was completely wrong
[16030.76s -> 16032.76s]  I just didn't even look over there. Okay
[16033.08s -> 16041.62s]  Nobody wants cheese. I'd appreciate more toppings good
[16042.66s -> 16054.29s]  There's something on that. I don't want time check. What do I got seven and a half minutes?
[16056.64s -> 16059.44s]  Uh and pepperoni
[16064.71s -> 16068.15s]  There's something there. I won't eat you don't want pepperoni
[16069.75s -> 16077.35s]  There's something on that. I don't want she might actually like pineapple because the cherry was there so he wanted it. I'll try that
[16086.93s -> 16088.37s]  No, okay
[16088.37s -> 16089.81s]  um
[16089.81s -> 16091.41s]  so you want
[16091.41s -> 16096.66s]  That one you want pepperoni sprinkles and jalapenos
[16106.64s -> 16108.95s]  What no, wait, what's going on?
[16109.19s -> 16112.07s]  Something's wrong pepperoni. What's happening pepperoni?
[16114.56s -> 16132.66s]  What doesn't want pineapple doesn't want mushrooms doesn't want jalapenos. What the hell do you want chocolate syrup?
[16132.98s -> 16137.44s]  Is it cheese?
[16137.44s -> 16141.51s]  I thought everybody didn't want cheese. Oh, it's because that one has a
[16142.23s -> 16147.09s]  Fucking cherry on it
[16147.57s -> 16149.65s]  What?
[16149.65s -> 16159.00s]  There's something on that. I don't want what it's mushrooms. Oh my god. What am I doing? It's mushrooms. It's mushrooms
[16159.08s -> 16162.04s]  Okay, I got it. I got it. It's mushrooms. It's literally mushrooms game over. I win
[16163.27s -> 16167.94s]  What toppings are?
[16168.18s -> 16169.86s]  Wait, what's happening?
[16169.86s -> 16171.62s]  What's going on?
[16171.62s -> 16175.54s]  I thought she liked mushrooms, which does she not like pepperoni? Was I not paying attention?
[16176.26s -> 16183.83s]  What happened? No. No, i'm serious. What happened? I thought she liked the pepperonis. She liked the mushrooms
[16186.45s -> 16193.11s]  I'm very confused right now. What did I just do to what happened? I just like blacked out for five seconds
[16193.67s -> 16206.36s]  I did she not want pepperoni. Why did what's going on? I just lost track of everything because look at all this shit
[16207.36s -> 16216.69s]  What happened? I got five minutes. I have to just start from scratch here. Okay, let's um, she likes mushrooms
[16218.13s -> 16225.51s]  Mushrooms and pepperoni just do it again. Just do it again. I fucked it up. Oh my god. What's happening actually fucking being stupid
[16227.03s -> 16233.43s]  Okay, she doesn't want pepperoni. Why did I think she wanted pepperoni? Why did I think she wanted pepperoni who why?
[16234.15s -> 16238.55s]  I don't even remember what made me think that what made me think she wanted pepperoni on this
[16239.94s -> 16243.30s]  Nobody nobody it's cheese
[16246.87s -> 16248.87s]  I got it. We're good
[16249.19s -> 16251.19s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[16253.75s -> 16257.67s]  How did I just black out the last like two minutes, I don't even know what happened
[16259.44s -> 16261.44s]  Oh shit. Okay. So what do you?
[16262.32s -> 16268.84s]  On your pizza
[16268.84s -> 16281.83s]  Is it no you don't want pineapple? Maybe it is pineapple because there was
[16282.39s -> 16284.39s]  That topping no, it's not pineapple
[16285.89s -> 16288.53s]  There's something on that. I don't want dude
[16288.61s -> 16292.61s]  I can't even read the chat and i've and I like I looked over here and forgot the whole game
[16294.26s -> 16297.86s]  I'm gonna get it right now. I'm not looking over at chat. I looked over at chat and I forgot the entire game
[16298.10s -> 16302.58s]  I like was like, oh, what are they doing over here? Oh interesting and I look back over and i'm like I forget the entire experience
[16303.30s -> 16307.60s]  All right. I'm not looking at chat ever again. What do you want?
[16308.93s -> 16312.97s]  You want this shit and you want jalapenos on it, too? That's a guarantee
[16317.72s -> 16323.96s]  Hmm little pizza makers good. Okay, let's go. Let's go. I got four minutes. I'm good. I have three minutes
[16324.84s -> 16329.77s]  What is this? What do you want? You don't like anything? This guy doesn't like anything. Let's just do um
[16331.16s -> 16338.94s]  This like more toppings, please. All right, good start
[16339.90s -> 16353.22s]  You don't want jalapenos. How about um, how about uh, uh
[16357.10s -> 16360.63s]  I gotta start from scratch. This is gonna be it
[16361.91s -> 16364.07s]  No, no cheese. All right, so we know no cheese
[16369.80s -> 16371.00s]  No cheese
[16371.00s -> 16377.72s]  What about just mushrooms?
[16377.96s -> 16382.76s]  Okay. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. No cheese. No mushrooms. What about just pepperoni? We're gonna get it
[16394.33s -> 16397.53s]  What's the time time? That's time. That's time. That's time. That's time. That's time. That's time
[16403.85s -> 16416.09s]  That's time how much time was left 150 seconds left. We got it. I completely forgot her entire order
[16417.88s -> 16419.75s]  Jesus
[16419.75s -> 16424.17s]  Don't have a bet against me and pizza maker
[16429.80s -> 16435.05s]  Have we not seen one on very very hard?
[16435.21s -> 16440.06s]  We haven't done this one here we go again
[16440.62s -> 16442.62s]  More of those little pebbles
[16442.62s -> 16447.21s]  And you can let them out. We don't need to bet any again. We don't have to bet again
[16448.90s -> 16454.02s]  Anymore I made all your money back
[16461.70s -> 16464.87s]  As it knows
[16464.87s -> 16466.87s]  You do not okay, maybe hair
[16467.59s -> 16481.00s]  What about hair? Let's try hair. What the actual hell did I just tune into the logical journey of the zoom beanies?
[16486.14s -> 16488.70s]  This way
[16493.82s -> 16495.53s]  Go ahead
[16495.53s -> 16497.59s]  Do go in
[16497.59s -> 16508.18s]  It was the easiest money of my life. Uh, can I go this way? Are you okay with me coming up? No, you're not
[16510.68s -> 16513.02s]  We must be selective about our clientele
[16516.10s -> 16522.78s]  So why can you go here but you can't what's the difference? Is it eyes? It has to be nose, right?
[16523.42s -> 16526.49s]  Yellow nose this way. No
[16527.56s -> 16532.87s]  Yellow nose this way
[16532.87s -> 16534.87s]  Has to be noses for the top bro
[16539.42s -> 16548.01s]  Okay
[16548.01s -> 16550.63s]  really
[16553.51s -> 16555.51s]  So this one must be eye no
[16555.67s -> 16560.92s]  hair
[16560.92s -> 16565.99s]  I have no idea
[16565.99s -> 16567.99s]  I guess we just figured it out
[16569.22s -> 16571.69s]  Uh, let's try that then
[16571.69s -> 16572.65s]  Okay
[16572.65s -> 16574.65s]  I think this is correct. No, it's not
[16578.78s -> 16582.04s]  Spring probably has to go up this way
[16587.91s -> 16600.46s]  Red nose over here. No red nose this way red nose this way. No. Oh, sorry
[16601.70s -> 16604.58s]  this way
[16605.46s -> 16616.36s]  A blue nose with this hair going this way. Nope, that's wrong. Enjoy yourself
[16616.76s -> 16625.94s]  That's correct pink and then there's there no green noses where the green noses go probably up around
[16631.86s -> 16637.59s]  All right, let's see happen. Do you want to see what happens when you lose? It's pretty bad
[16643.56s -> 16654.87s]  Ready? Why is it not happening?
[16660.79s -> 16677.94s]  Can you lose on practice? Oh, yes, you can. Yeah you can
[16681.90s -> 16687.32s]  Can't let you in this whole place is gonna fucking cave in
[16702.89s -> 16707.53s]  They're very forgiving on this level unlike every other level in the game on hard
[16715.30s -> 16719.24s]  Why do I remember this being way more morbid? I thought the whole thing caved in
[16726.76s -> 16741.37s]  All right, that's probably it. That was fun. Any encores you'd like to see before we stop any encores do the lion room
[16745.72s -> 16750.84s]  Do pizza again paint wall again. Let me do paint wall on the on the very hard. Not very very hard
[16759.99s -> 16763.51s]  Okay, that's very weird. I don't know why they'd be this far away from each other
[16767.46s -> 16788.58s]  How would these two be this far away? They have the same hair. They have the same feet. Okay blue pink blue
[16790.31s -> 16793.88s]  pink blue
[16793.88s -> 16796.18s]  I don't know pink pink
[16800.73s -> 16802.73s]  blue pink blue
[16804.89s -> 16808.70s]  Pink blue
[16808.70s -> 16810.06s]  blue
[16810.06s -> 16813.26s]  Blue pink blue blue blue pink pink
[16813.90s -> 16820.49s]  pink green
[16822.17s -> 16823.37s]  Green
[16823.37s -> 16824.25s]  No
[16824.25s -> 16855.37s]  It's the eyes. Yeah, I know but but who goes where because I can't just put this guy right here the hair and the eyes
[16858.44s -> 16862.22s]  Eyes, then feet so it would be that
[16863.02s -> 16866.63s]  Okay
[16866.63s -> 16878.86s]  Um, i'm gonna imagine it's this and then this and then
[16882.22s -> 16892.52s]  This but what how do I determine this then like this?
[16896.06s -> 16915.62s]  Very very very hard. Very very very hard. This one is not on very very very hard. All right. Good got it
[16916.84s -> 16919.61s]  Interior blue
[16919.61s -> 16928.12s]  Exterior blue diamond. Why did I just do that twice? I need to go eat a fucking jar of peanut butter
[16931.80s -> 16947.11s]  I thought that was wait. I'm confusing myself. Here it is. I had to mute you dude. Sorry. You're annoying
[16947.51s -> 16952.18s]  I had to mute. What are you doing here?
[16961.90s -> 16963.86s]  Okay, how about that?
[16963.86s -> 16983.51s]  Nope a jar one of the whole jar a like a few spoonfuls. All right, so this is blue
[16984.15s -> 16985.82s]  red
[16985.82s -> 16988.18s]  Let's just try pink
[16988.26s -> 16991.43s]  No, okay. What about yellow?
[16991.43s -> 16993.67s]  Got it yellow with a diamond
[16994.29s -> 17001.29s]  interior
[17001.29s -> 17003.74s]  circle interior
[17003.74s -> 17007.83s]  Why peanut butter protein protein good fats?
[17016.04s -> 17024.55s]  Okay, so we need to find a different
[17025.41s -> 17028.50s]  interior
[17028.50s -> 17029.86s]  Okay
[17029.86s -> 17032.82s]  Red interiors. I need red interior triangle
[17033.62s -> 17034.66s]  yellow
[17034.66s -> 17044.36s]  This is green
[17044.36s -> 17046.84s]  exterior
[17046.84s -> 17058.02s]  Red interior triangle, okay
[17060.22s -> 17067.19s]  so
[17067.35s -> 17070.87s]  yellow interior
[17071.03s -> 17075.16s]  square
[17075.16s -> 17076.12s]  green
[17076.12s -> 17089.54s]  exterior pink
[17089.54s -> 17101.70s]  Interior there's only two places it could be pink interior or green interior. We're gonna do pink interior which hopefully is over here
[17105.14s -> 17112.23s]  pink exterior
[17112.23s -> 17114.49s]  square
[17114.49s -> 17120.63s]  right
[17120.63s -> 17122.23s]  Ah
[17122.23s -> 17135.85s]  It's right here. Do I have enough shots to do one more? No, there's no more mud. Damn it. It's all right
[17136.25s -> 17149.42s]  It's okay. Do it again. All right one more time that one. This one's fun
[17150.30s -> 17156.62s]  This time I don't want to waste that much. Let's go
[17159.22s -> 17162.50s]  All right. So what does that mean? Let's try a different one. Let's try like just like circle
[17163.62s -> 17173.40s]  Okay
[17178.50s -> 17180.66s]  Shit okay, this is gonna be weird. So this is yellow
[17183.46s -> 17187.06s]  diamond
[17187.06s -> 17189.06s]  so this would be
[17189.98s -> 17192.46s]  God, I don't know. It's all green exterior in here
[17194.87s -> 17210.44s]  When the interior is in the same area like this, it's kind of hard. I'm gonna say red. No blue interior and
[17210.92s -> 17212.60s]  star
[17212.60s -> 17221.30s]  Nope pink interior
[17223.10s -> 17225.10s]  square
[17225.10s -> 17231.45s]  Good. All right. We're gonna go red exterior
[17232.49s -> 17234.49s]  pink interior square
[17234.49s -> 17242.20s]  I'm hoping it's this one right here. We're gonna do blue exterior red pink interior square
[17242.76s -> 17270.87s]  So what is all what would be all the way to the right circle? Right? No star. No square. No triangle yellow interior
[17271.11s -> 17281.56s]  Is a his here blue exterior is here. It'll be triangle. Okay
[17284.79s -> 17288.01s]  blue exterior
[17288.01s -> 17292.55s]  green interior
[17292.55s -> 17296.52s]  Triangle I am so
[17297.46s -> 17301.62s]  brilliant at this
[17301.62s -> 17306.89s]  Okay, I think i'll get it this time yellow exterior
[17313.35s -> 17316.46s]  We're hoping it's this one yellow exterior
[17317.46s -> 17319.96s]  square
[17319.96s -> 17323.51s]  pink
[17323.51s -> 17325.51s]  Ah
[17328.22s -> 17334.55s]  What no I fucked it up yellow exterior blue interior there it is
[17338.20s -> 17340.04s]  I have two more shots in here for sure
[17340.04s -> 17351.11s]  pink exterior
[17351.11s -> 17355.98s]  What's in the middle star?
[17358.70s -> 17362.55s]  and
[17362.55s -> 17365.94s]  yellow interior
[17367.27s -> 17373.48s]  Oh, no, no, no, it's the third slot. What's the third slot trying diamond? I got one more shot. I'm good
[17373.56s -> 17382.06s]  Let's go get it right. All right
[17382.06s -> 17390.10s]  I got one more shot. This is triangle with a pink exterior
[17392.81s -> 17403.91s]  And a blue interior think that's correct. All right, I got it
[17404.39s -> 17418.63s]  I got it earlier in the stream. You said you don't know mountain rescue, but you literally streamed it
[17418.87s -> 17424.94s]  I know but here's the thing dude
[17425.02s -> 17431.56s]  I've played like I've played like two or three thousand video games over the last 12 years doing this
[17431.88s -> 17439.03s]  I I don't remember all of them. I just really don't I just don't remember
[17443.86s -> 17445.70s]  some some of them like
[17445.70s -> 17447.78s]  Like seven or eight nine years ago
[17448.44s -> 17452.46s]  I don't I don't have the capacity to remember every single video game
[17452.54s -> 17460.98s]  I played five to ten years ago, like if you put it in front of me, I'd be like, oh, okay, right
[17462.54s -> 17468.54s]  All right, but there's been
[17469.26s -> 17481.91s]  Millions of pieces of information have gone through here over the last 15 years. I win. All right, and that's it
[17482.23s -> 17495.82s]  I'm just trying to get one across
[17495.82s -> 17560.94s]  It sounds like a lincoln park sound it kind of does hey one survived. All right, these are impossible
[17564.25s -> 17568.63s]  All right, that's gonna be it. That's all the plan was today. Let's play this for a little while
[17568.95s -> 17573.30s]  Look at how much easier this is one easy
[17573.62s -> 17585.34s]  Okay, you guys ready? I literally thought the perfect game you should play it's called you're in the movies. I played that already
[17585.66s -> 17595.62s]  So here's the thing. What is
[17596.02s -> 17603.02s]  What is a good game that I can play? I have a couple of options here
[17605.98s -> 17612.38s]  I'm not talking about today talking about the next time I stream. I've really been playing this for five hours
[17613.88s -> 17621.70s]  It was fun. Maybe we'll do like a grab bag stream
[17622.34s -> 17624.10s]  next stream
[17624.10s -> 17632.36s]  Yeah, so s3 is still on the 24th because we we got through the things I wanted to get through
[17633.08s -> 17639.50s]  I wanted to play zoom beanies. We did that. I wanted to
[17640.06s -> 17647.40s]  Play katamari and finish it. We did that do the lies of p demo. I'll probably just wait for the full game
[17647.80s -> 17654.34s]  I'm imagining the lies of p demo is the tutorial zone and the tutorial boss and then that's it
[17654.58s -> 17663.88s]  I'll just wait till it's up. Maybe we'll do a grab bag on
[17664.44s -> 17673.00s]  Monday. I'll see you guys on monday next stream do more infomercials
[17675.00s -> 17678.28s]  Maybe a reverse delay maybe a reverse delay in the future
[17678.60s -> 17681.40s]  It's possible. I just stream on sunday
[17681.40s -> 17690.20s]  But let's plan for monday and then maybe i'll show up on sunday. We'll see keep an eye on the sus
[17690.28s -> 17697.32s]  It might change it definitely won't be later than monday, but it could be sunday. It won't be it's not gonna be tuesday
[17698.76s -> 17702.10s]  It's not gonna be tuesday. It's gonna be
[17702.82s -> 17719.93s]  At some point as at some point as of monday there will be a stream sunday or monday, but that is the end
[17720.01s -> 17727.19s]  Have a great night. See you guys later. See you on monday or sunday. He's gonna delay till wednesday. No, I will not
[17732.74s -> 17734.74s]  I will not delay till wednesday
[17740.44s -> 17745.16s]  Thanks for sticking around. Thanks for hanging out. That was zoom. It's on steam zoom beanies is on steam if you feel like playing it
[17745.40s -> 17749.74s]  It was a good time. Thanks for hanging out. See you guys on
[17750.38s -> 17759.82s]  monday or so
[17759.82s -> 17761.82s]  Somebody said nah, i'm good
[17762.74s -> 17767.21s]  That is so much more. All right, they're like nah, i'm good
[17768.06s -> 17774.23s]  It's so much worse than no than just saying no, don't you think so?
[17775.50s -> 17780.78s]  Saying i'm good means you've really thought about it and we're like, nah, nah fucking i'm i'm good. I'm good
[17781.64s -> 17790.28s]  That would make it bad. I'm good over here to me. That's more insulting than just saying no like oh
[17790.44s -> 17792.44s]  You're gonna be there on monday?
[17793.06s -> 17800.71s]  No. Oh, okay. Cool. Hey, you're gonna be there on monday. No, i'm good because to me i'm good means
[17802.49s -> 17807.37s]  I thought about it and the answer is no no means there could be something else going on that you're missing the stream for
[17808.12s -> 17811.32s]  You got homework. You got friends are coming over. You got some stuff to do
[17811.88s -> 17816.68s]  You don't feel like watching twitch that you know, it could be it could mean anything. I'm good means you've already thought about it
[17820.18s -> 17824.60s]  Banned that person for life by the way. All right. I'll see you guys later. Thanks for watching. See you on monday
[17824.68s -> 17827.82s]  Goodbye. Good night. Call your mother. See you soon. Take care of yourselves
[17830.88s -> 17843.96s]  Overthinking andy i'm i'm kidding. Don't worry. Well, the credits are over
[17845.82s -> 17846.78s]  Oops
[17846.78s -> 17853.83s]  All right. Good night guys. See you later. Have a good one
[17937.90s -> 17940.38s]  Also, I want to talk quietly in case anyone was
[17940.94s -> 17942.62s]  I'm still here
[17942.62s -> 17945.34s]  I'm waiting till it's exactly five hours of stream time
[17946.46s -> 17948.46s]  Because I can't 459
[17949.10s -> 17951.58s]  Is is just killing me here has to be five
[17953.13s -> 17956.01s]  And it has to be that's gonna drive me crazy
[17957.69s -> 17959.69s]  All right. See you later
