[0.31s -> 9.70s]  Let's ditch him.
[9.70s -> 15.30s]  Those are some big tires you've got there, Jerma.
[16.30s -> 21.44s]  They're better to see you with. They're better to eat you with, my dear.
[24.44s -> 27.44s]  Yep, those are all solid objects. Okay, that is two.
[27.44s -> 31.44s]  Alright, this is where I want to go. I want to get on this because I'm going to turn around.
[31.44s -> 33.44s]  We're going to get some big air.
[36.54s -> 42.54s]  Alright, what's the proper way to change weapons while inside of a vehicle?
[42.54s -> 45.54s]  Mouse... No, that's not going to do it.
[45.54s -> 48.54s]  It's mouse scroll outside of the vehicle.
[48.54s -> 50.54s]  Not sure what it is inside, though.
[50.54s -> 52.54s]  Whoa, that cop was flying.
[52.54s -> 56.54s]  Inside the vehicle it is change radio stations.
[56.54s -> 58.54s]  Ready for some dukes of hazards?
[58.54s -> 60.54s]  Let's try and catch the mirror with this little leap.
[60.54s -> 62.54s]  Oh, we didn't get in the air.
[62.54s -> 64.54s]  That was the leap back there.
[64.54s -> 67.54s]  I thought it was the leap, but I guess not.
[67.54s -> 69.71s]  I guess not, huh?
[70.71s -> 73.71s]  Switch to the driver's seat.
[73.71s -> 77.07s]  Okay, maybe not.
[80.46s -> 86.78s]  I probably would have been better off just sitting in the vehicle.
[103.43s -> 107.43s]  I just spawned and you like flew by the screen.
[109.80s -> 112.80s]  Why did I spawn at the perfect time? That was awesome.
[112.80s -> 115.55s]  Oh, how surreal.
[115.55s -> 117.98s]  I flew you out of the car.
[123.90s -> 135.47s]  I picked up something that looked remotely like statue charges,
[135.47s -> 138.47s]  and I clicked the button right as you ran into me.
[138.47s -> 144.47s]  So, I can only assume that I successfully planted C4 on your vehicle.
[144.47s -> 147.47s]  You smacked your face on the car.
[149.61s -> 152.36s]  One of us is going to have a bad day.
[152.36s -> 156.33s]  A real bad day.
[156.33s -> 158.63s]  Where's Boo? I see him coming, but I don't see him.
[158.63s -> 160.63s]  Boo, where you at?
[160.63s -> 162.63s]  Oh my, police.
[162.63s -> 164.63s]  Turn around, Boo.
[164.63s -> 166.63s]  Alright, let's do it.
[166.63s -> 168.63s]  Watch out for the guy in the Ferrari.
[173.51s -> 175.51s]  That seriously startled me.
[175.51s -> 176.51s]  That scared me.
[176.51s -> 178.51s]  What is blowing up?
[178.51s -> 180.51s]  What just happened?
[182.52s -> 184.52s]  Why are there so many explosions?
[184.52s -> 187.52s]  Apparently, I had my grenade launcher out.
[195.89s -> 196.89s]  Where are you guys?
[196.89s -> 198.89s]  I'm trying to play Ski... Wow.
[198.89s -> 200.89s]  What?
[200.89s -> 202.89s]  What did you just do?
[202.89s -> 207.80s]  I'm trying to...
[207.80s -> 209.80s]  I'm trying to play Ski Ball.
[209.80s -> 215.39s]  And this is what you do when you play Ski Ball.
[216.39s -> 218.39s]  Oopsie daisy.
[218.39s -> 222.92s]  I can't even like...
[222.92s -> 223.92s]  Who shot that?
[223.92s -> 225.92s]  What is going on over there?
[225.92s -> 228.35s]  I just saw that firsthand.
[228.35s -> 230.35s]  You just crashed into that building.
[230.35s -> 232.35s]  Yeah, but I landed.
[232.35s -> 234.35s]  I landed on top of the building.
[234.35s -> 238.35s]  My character flew through the window, safely, on top of the building.
[238.35s -> 240.35s]  That was incredible.
[240.35s -> 242.35s]  Can I still fly this thing?
[242.35s -> 244.66s]  Is this thing still able to be flown?
[244.66s -> 246.66s]  My character is trying to find a way.
[246.66s -> 247.66s]  Maybe that way.
[247.66s -> 250.22s]  Just get in, you butt head.
[250.22s -> 254.18s]  Will you just get in?
[254.18s -> 255.18s]  What is he doing?
[255.18s -> 257.18s]  He's like so unsure of himself.
[257.18s -> 258.18s]  I don't know, should I get in?
[258.18s -> 259.18s]  I don't think so.
[259.18s -> 261.06s]  No, maybe not.
[261.06s -> 264.54s]  I get an idea.
[264.54s -> 265.54s]  I'm gonna move this thing.
[265.54s -> 266.54s]  I'm gonna just ram into it.
[266.54s -> 268.04s]  Move.
[268.04s -> 270.43s]  Get in.
[270.43s -> 273.04s]  I gotta find you guys again.
[273.04s -> 274.47s]  I will get in this.
[274.47s -> 277.31s]  I just need a car.
[277.31s -> 278.81s]  Like this car.
[278.81s -> 281.18s]  Hey, I didn't even need to move it.
[281.18s -> 284.18s]  This moron ran into it for me.
[284.18s -> 293.32s]  Who would drive directly into a helicopter?
[293.32s -> 295.32s]  It's gonna be like that, is it, boo?
[295.32s -> 296.32s]  No.
[296.32s -> 298.32s]  Dude, seriously, just get in the helicopter.
[298.32s -> 308.37s]  That's a nice little jump you found.
[308.37s -> 309.37s]  Alright.
[309.37s -> 311.67s]  Let's see how this works.
[311.67s -> 316.58s]  So everybody, keep you guys...
[316.58s -> 318.58s]  Is it straight down that way or straight down that way?
[318.58s -> 323.44s]  Straight from where you guys are?
[323.44s -> 324.44s]  Like right here?
[324.44s -> 325.62s]  Yep.
[325.62s -> 326.62s]  Alright, you guys ready?
[326.62s -> 328.79s]  Let's do it, baby, all at the same time.
[328.79s -> 329.79s]  Are we going?
[329.79s -> 331.48s]  Are we going?
[331.48s -> 332.48s]  Yeah, just go.
[332.48s -> 334.04s]  We gotta line up.
[334.04s -> 335.04s]  We're not going fast enough.
[335.04s -> 336.04s]  Yeah, wait, wait.
[336.04s -> 337.04s]  Stop right there.
[337.04s -> 338.04s]  Stop right there.
[338.04s -> 339.34s]  Stop right there.
[339.34s -> 340.34s]  Everybody line up right here.
[340.34s -> 341.34s]  We gotta get some speed.
[341.34s -> 344.52s]  Oh, watch out for the police.
[344.52s -> 346.52s]  This guy's after me, by the way.
[346.52s -> 348.52s]  This bastard's trying to kill me.
[348.52s -> 351.91s]  Alright, so everybody line up.
[351.91s -> 355.82s]  Just like good little boys and girls.
[355.82s -> 357.82s]  Are these kids in traffic?
[357.82s -> 359.82s]  Alright, you ready?
[359.82s -> 361.82s]  What is that guy's problem?
[361.82s -> 363.82s]  Alright, you ready?
[363.82s -> 364.82s]  Alright, you ready?
[364.82s -> 366.12s]  Yeah.
[366.12s -> 368.12s]  Just like good little students.
[368.12s -> 369.12s]  Ready?
[369.12s -> 373.18s]  One, two, three, go.
[373.18s -> 375.18s]  Oh, the tandem.
[375.18s -> 376.18s]  Here we go.
[376.18s -> 378.18s]  All go up at the same time.
[378.18s -> 380.18s]  See you later, guys.
[403.65s -> 405.65s]  Oh, there's just all kinds of explosions.
[405.65s -> 410.49s]  What is happening here?
[410.49s -> 411.49s]  Oh my god.
[411.49s -> 413.49s]  I love hitting my face on cars.
[413.49s -> 414.49s]  It is so...
[414.49s -> 415.49s]  Whoa!
[417.82s -> 422.06s]  Please don't kill me.
[422.06s -> 424.06s]  Please don't kill me.
[424.06s -> 425.74s]  Why am I running towards you?
[425.74s -> 428.74s]  I'm trying to jump and grab onto the ledge.
[428.74s -> 430.69s]  Come here.
[430.69s -> 432.69s]  I'm gonna get the ledge.
[432.69s -> 434.69s]  It's gonna be mine.
[434.69s -> 436.99s]  I'm going to get it.
[436.99s -> 437.99s]  I'm not careful, man.
[437.99s -> 439.99s]  You're going to slice off my head.
[439.99s -> 442.55s]  What happens if I hit you with the blades?
[442.55s -> 443.55s]  I don't know.
[443.55s -> 446.55s]  Let's find out.
[446.55s -> 448.55s]  Where am I?
[448.55s -> 451.43s]  Where am I?
[451.43s -> 453.43s]  You just zipped up into the sky.
[453.43s -> 459.32s]  I'm like...
[459.32s -> 460.32s]  I don't know.
[460.32s -> 462.32s]  If I scream, I'm black.
[462.32s -> 464.32s]  I take it you didn't survive then.
[464.32s -> 466.32s]  Oh, no.
