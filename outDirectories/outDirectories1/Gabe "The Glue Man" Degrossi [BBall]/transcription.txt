[0.25s -> 14.36s]  Today's video we're gonna open up a box on camera. Oh, I've already done it. I've already done it.
[14.36s -> 17.36s]  Out of the arena and look out, look out, hey, whoa, whoa, watch out!
[17.36s -> 22.86s]  Mayo coming up the front of the court over the Boston Celtics sign, passing it over to Knight, Knight layup.
[22.86s -> 29.86s]  That's two points for Milwaukee. Now we've got Gabe Glewman Degrosie gonna do, well that's what he typically does.
[29.86s -> 33.86s]  And it's in! Another three points for the Boston Celtics.
[33.86s -> 37.86s]  A deficit like this is gonna be hard to come back from for the Milwaukee Brewers.
[37.86s -> 42.86s]  But maybe they can mount something. They need to get some type of offense and keep the defense alive.
[42.86s -> 46.86s]  Oh, what a fake there, passing it over to Sanders. Two points for Milwaukee again.
[46.86s -> 51.86s]  You gotta give Milwaukee some credit here though. They've showed perseverance this entire game.
[51.86s -> 56.86s]  How do you go up against a team like the Celtics of 1997? I'm not entirely sure Degrosie now.
[56.86s -> 59.86s]  Passing Technique, that's another three points.
[59.86s -> 65.86s]  If you can hear the speechlessness in my voice, it's because I need somebody call a nuclear physicist right now.
[65.86s -> 72.86s]  And ask them, how is this even possible to score three points every single possession the entire season?
[72.86s -> 77.86s]  You've got Gabe the Glewman Degrosie. They gave him that name because he's got hands like glue.
[77.86s -> 83.86s]  And he can throw the ball so well. And he was able to teach the entire team how to do this.
[83.86s -> 86.86s]  And I just don't understand. And Degrosie's not gonna get the ball.
[86.86s -> 92.86s]  Wallace, Wallace is gonna do it now. That's gonna be three points. They've never missed one time the whole season.
[92.86s -> 97.86s]  I haven't casted a game for the Celtics, but this is the first time I've casted a Celtics game.
[97.86s -> 106.86s]  And I must tell you, ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the most remarkable basketball games I have ever encountered in my entire 67 years on the planet.
[106.86s -> 113.86s]  So now we're gonna just try to calm down here. Glewman, how do you calm down? How do you calm down when something like that happens?
[113.86s -> 116.86s]  How do you calm down? How am I supposed to...?
[116.86s -> 119.86s]  Knight's got the ball now. We have Knight on the Milwaukee team with the ball.
[119.86s -> 122.86s]  He's gonna try to come up court. He's gonna do a jump shot right at the paint and he misses.
[122.86s -> 125.86s]  But Frank Pizza's got the ball now. Frank Pizza with a toss. And it's...
[125.86s -> 129.86s]  Oh! He missed it.
[129.86s -> 136.86s]  Frank Pizza just missed the first shot of the entire season. And that's just unbelievable. I really can't believe that.
[136.86s -> 141.86s]  And of all the things we've seen here tonight, ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you I did not expect Frank Pizza
[141.86s -> 145.86s]  to be the guy to ruin the streak of the Boston Celtics. But can we start it again?
[145.86s -> 153.86s]  We're gonna start it again! Start that counter at zero and add one to it, ladies and gentlemen, because that is the first of many from these Boston Celtics.
[153.86s -> 160.86s]  They are making a speed leave again, which is something that their GM over and over again has said in interviews.
[160.86s -> 164.86s]  Dan Bringus, we caught up with him earlier this afternoon.
[164.86s -> 172.86s]  Look, I'm gonna say the same thing I've said like 12 times now. I fucking hate this job and I hate this whole fucking organization.
[172.86s -> 179.86s]  And this whole throw the ball as hard as you can from the back of the court was a joke to get me fired. And it didn't work.
[179.86s -> 188.86s]  Wiser words I don't think have ever been spoken. But down to the final 15 seconds, Milwaukee down by nearly 200 points.
[188.86s -> 194.86s]  Not even entirely sure why you shoot the basket right there. I would just go take a long shower and think about this.
[194.86s -> 199.86s]  Jordan at the buzzer for good measure gets the final one at the buzzer.
[199.86s -> 206.86s]  And for the 67th time, the Boston Celtics are going to win in near perfect fashion.
[206.86s -> 212.86s]  And because obviously it's the end of the game, as we see the players all take off into their respective locker rooms,
[212.86s -> 217.86s]  I'm going to have to give the player of the game award to Gabe Gloomander Grossi.
[217.86s -> 220.86s]  That's right. The fan favorite. You all know him. You all love him.
[220.86s -> 224.86s]  I really truly think he is one of the best players to ever live.
[224.86s -> 231.86s]  And honestly, I hope to God nothing bad happens to this guy like 10 years from now.
