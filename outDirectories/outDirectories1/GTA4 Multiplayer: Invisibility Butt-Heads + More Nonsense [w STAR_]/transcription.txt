[1.27s -> 5.34s]  It's a beautiful day today. Did you see the sun?
[5.34s -> 9.03s]  I can't see the sun because of my cameras facing the stairs.
[9.03s -> 15.03s]  Oh, well, you know, just sitting on this staircase with you makes me just remember the days when I was younger.
[15.03s -> 19.03s]  There was all kinds of fun things we used to do. I used to come to the-
[20.03s -> 33.36s]  Oh, my head, Jerma. Is this what you used to do in the old days?
[43.79s -> 48.22s]  Well, I didn't think we would ever be in outer space together, just floating around.
[48.22s -> 53.40s]  I don't know what to say. This is too dumb. Whoa, where are we going?
[53.40s -> 57.96s]  I kind of want to just- I want to see what happens when I try to get out.
[59.96s -> 66.51s]  This is so awkward looking. Good thing I'm like riding you.
[67.51s -> 69.51s]  This is just a piggyback.
[84.06s -> 96.94s]  No, get out of my way. It's my friend. No, I want to get in. No, I'm in. I can't. I have to drive it.
[103.97s -> 105.97s]  These guys are too dangerous, yet again.
[105.97s -> 111.45s]  No, we don't want you to drive the car. You die.
[111.45s -> 118.74s]  It's going too fast.
[118.74s -> 120.74s]  You're going to make me sick.
[120.74s -> 128.62s]  We're going to the water.
[128.62s -> 131.62s]  This is so stupid. I'm going to hit my head on the-
[135.61s -> 149.15s]  This is real. That person's head would have just censored great.
[149.15s -> 158.50s]  Okay, here we go. Here we go. We're doing a revert ramp.
[158.50s -> 160.50s]  Oh, yeah. Tony Hawk's pro skater.
[161.80s -> 163.80s]  Except with bikes, so completely different.
[164.80s -> 166.80s]  Damn, that was sick.
[166.80s -> 171.17s]  200 points. 300 points. You are a rock star.
[172.86s -> 174.86s]  150 points.
[179.55s -> 180.55s]  How many points, Jeremiah?
[180.55s -> 187.14s]  Didn't kill me.
[187.14s -> 191.51s]  Look at the two ostriches in their natural habitat.
[191.51s -> 194.51s]  I want someone to walk by and see us like this.
[194.51s -> 202.38s]  And just be like, what the fuck is going on here?
[202.38s -> 203.38s]  Get in the car.
[203.38s -> 206.38s]  What about these dolls that are just standing upright?
[222.51s -> 227.51s]  This larch-looking son of a bitch is still standing.
[228.75s -> 230.75s]  Look at this person.
[230.75s -> 234.14s]  She has just moved.
[234.14s -> 237.14s]  Look at the way she's holding the gun. Look at her shoulders.
[237.14s -> 239.14s]  She's hunched over. She just doesn't care.
[246.14s -> 248.14s]  I thought she instantly died.
[256.09s -> 258.09s]  She had enough.
[258.09s -> 261.10s]  She had enough.
[261.10s -> 262.10s]  I'm not sure what's happening.
[262.10s -> 268.37s]  Oh, this is so stupid.
[268.37s -> 270.37s]  Can we move on from this?
[270.37s -> 272.37s]  What? Why?
[272.37s -> 274.37s]  Why did that happen?
[274.37s -> 276.37s]  Why is it not letting us go over this?
[280.02s -> 283.02s]  What is it?
[286.08s -> 296.62s]  Are you dead?
[296.62s -> 302.47s]  I don't know.
[302.47s -> 305.47s]  Apparently, if you stub your toe, you just die.
[305.47s -> 307.47s]  You know what? I think I was dead in midair,
[307.47s -> 309.47s]  and it just didn't say I was dead until I left.
[314.55s -> 331.75s]  I don't have any words for this.
[333.75s -> 338.44s]  Did you see how we were jello-jiggling down that staircase?
[338.44s -> 341.44s]  No, I just instantly died and was gone.
[342.44s -> 343.44s]  That was jello.
[343.44s -> 346.44s]  We were just jello sliding around in somebody's cup.
[346.44s -> 349.70s]  Do you eat jello out of a cup?
[349.70s -> 351.70s]  Yeah, you can.
[351.70s -> 353.70s]  I mean, you can, but would you?
[353.70s -> 355.94s]  Don't hit me over here.
[355.94s -> 357.94s]  You'll never get me.
[360.98s -> 365.89s]  What?
[365.89s -> 368.32s]  I got you.
[368.32s -> 370.32s]  How did this even happen?
[370.32s -> 375.31s]  No, the tire.
[375.31s -> 379.64s]  Something tells me that's not going to work.
[379.64s -> 383.80s]  That's not going to work.
[383.80s -> 385.80s]  You're going to crash your game.
[385.80s -> 397.19s]  You just wait until one of them spawns up there.
[397.19s -> 403.91s]  The balance.
[403.91s -> 407.47s]  I could not replicate that if I tried.
[407.47s -> 409.47s]  I just love how you keep ditching different cars
[409.47s -> 411.90s]  and trying other things.
[411.90s -> 412.90s]  Okay, I got it this time.
[412.90s -> 414.90s]  For some reason, I don't have hydraulics,
[414.90s -> 417.90s]  but I'm putting the hydraulics on.
[417.90s -> 418.90s]  God damn it, that doesn't work.
[418.90s -> 419.90s]  Ditch it.
[419.90s -> 422.04s]  Try the helicopter.
[422.04s -> 425.04s]  No, let's try 14 garbage trucks.
[425.04s -> 428.52s]  Come on, do the thing.
[428.52s -> 432.42s]  I know you're going to do it.
[432.42s -> 434.42s]  No, get away from me.
[434.42s -> 436.92s]  No, get away from me.
[436.92s -> 442.12s]  No, no, no.
[442.12s -> 443.12s]  Get me up.
[443.12s -> 449.99s]  Get me up.
[449.99s -> 461.08s]  You made a staircase of garbage trucks.
[461.08s -> 463.08s]  You ought to do some platforming.
