[5.88s -> 7.16s]  I'm sure you've tested it.
[7.16s -> 10.76s]  Oh, you're the first thing they heard, was you loudly yelling.
[13.35s -> 17.11s]  Yeah, hi guys. We're not currently live yet. I mean, well, Ster is.
[17.11s -> 22.55s]  That was just weird. The moment you start watching me play PUE on your stream,
[22.55s -> 25.91s]  you're gonna drop down to like 1k viewers concurrent for the rest of your life.
[29.03s -> 32.23s]  Just funnel everybody to you and they never come back.
[34.28s -> 37.24s]  No, they're just gone forever from both of us.
[37.24s -> 39.00s]  Oh, they just they just disappear.
[39.00s -> 43.32s]  Yeah, they like see what's on the screen and go, why was I watching this guy?
[44.20s -> 47.24s]  So maybe like later, I can follow both channels.
[47.24s -> 50.60s]  Yeah, and we can just go to Dying Light.
[50.60s -> 52.76s]  All right, fine. All right. Well, you show me later.
[53.56s -> 58.47s]  Yeah, we're gonna play Dying Light 2.
[59.43s -> 63.19s]  Or what would have been a more funnier title, Coffee Cheetos Chicken Remastered.
[63.99s -> 67.51s]  I didn't want to put that in the title though, because I don't want to.
[67.51s -> 69.43s]  The Zombie Jackasses 2.
[69.43s -> 73.02s]  Yeah. You know what's really funny about Coffee Cheetos Chicken?
[74.10s -> 75.62s]  That video's not even live.
[75.62s -> 77.62s]  That's an unlisted fucking video, yeah.
[77.62s -> 81.46s]  That is on your channel, it was a secret hidden video that you had.
[82.26s -> 85.43s]  I don't know how everybody found it and it became what it is.
[86.23s -> 93.88s]  It was a secret video. Did you eventually public it?
[93.88s -> 96.76s]  No, I did. I made a joke that I would and I never did.
[100.15s -> 101.03s]  Oh, that's funny.
[103.75s -> 105.91s]  I mean, it's unlisted, never made public.
[105.91s -> 108.39s]  It's about 200,000 views, which is like.
[109.11s -> 112.15s]  Which I mean, which is that's crazy for it being unlisted,
[112.15s -> 116.15s]  but in the grand scheme of things, how many people reference that exact video?
[116.15s -> 117.35s]  That's not very much.
[117.35s -> 120.39s]  Yeah, I would have thought it would have been more with how much it gets brought up.
[120.39s -> 124.81s]  All right, let's get in the game.
[124.81s -> 125.69s]  Do I just invite you?
[126.97s -> 128.97s]  Well, I'm not online yet. Are you online in Steam?
[128.97s -> 130.81s]  Are you like hiding like celebrities?
[132.01s -> 135.37s]  You know, I'm constantly offline, but I think I can invite you.
[135.37s -> 138.84s]  Let's see. Let's see, can I?
[139.48s -> 143.61s]  There's like a system where I can.
[146.28s -> 149.72s]  Uh, when you press escape, it's like F4 for friends menu.
[149.72s -> 152.60s]  Yeah, online link to the Epic Games store.
[153.40s -> 154.28s]  I'm not doing that.
[155.24s -> 165.03s]  OK, if I'm so I'm online right now, can I like, how do we like join a party?
[165.67s -> 173.59s]  Find games? No, wait, sort.
[173.59s -> 176.54s]  Is it can I sort by like friend or something?
[177.42s -> 178.62s]  I don't think so.
[181.56s -> 183.64s]  Yeah, we're early. We're a little early.
[183.64s -> 187.00s]  Well, stirs been streaming for like an hour, but this stream is like 10 minutes early
[187.00s -> 188.76s]  because we're making sure we can get in the game.
[191.86s -> 192.82s]  That's what makes sense.
[192.82s -> 194.18s]  Let's pretend we're not here.
[194.18s -> 199.13s]  We're not here. The streams are offline right now.
[199.13s -> 202.49s]  Because I mean, I can open up friends, but I can't.
[202.49s -> 206.01s]  If I see your name here, I can't like do anything about it.
[206.65s -> 210.94s]  I mean, I just open up your profile.
[210.94s -> 211.66s]  My name is gas.
[211.66s -> 213.50s]  Oh, well, I'm adding you to favorites.
[213.50s -> 214.70s]  No, it has you.
[214.70s -> 215.82s]  Oh, I guess I have you.
[216.78s -> 217.34s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[217.34s -> 218.22s]  I don't get it.
[218.22s -> 219.58s]  Yeah, I have no idea.
[222.86s -> 223.42s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[223.42s -> 224.30s]  I'm sending you an invite.
[224.30s -> 225.58s]  Oh, how'd you do that?
[225.98s -> 229.10s]  I held down S to call for support.
[231.40s -> 233.80s]  And now wait, is your game private or is your game public?
[234.36s -> 235.40s]  I don't know.
[235.40s -> 237.16s]  Oh, you don't know your game is public.
[237.16s -> 238.44s]  You get this game is public.
[238.44s -> 239.80s]  We got to get out of here now.
[239.80s -> 241.45s]  I'm dropping out.
[246.66s -> 248.34s]  We're going to get we're going to get it.
[248.34s -> 248.90s]  Okay. Okay.
[248.90s -> 250.98s]  No, I changed. I changed it to private.
[250.98s -> 251.48s]  Okay.
[255.58s -> 259.50s]  Okay. I'm putting down the my mark in front of the boss.
[259.50s -> 260.78s]  You have to do the tutorial first.
[260.78s -> 261.82s]  We we've done that.
[261.82s -> 262.46s]  We're ready to go.
[262.54s -> 264.54s]  We just wanted to figure out how the multiplayer work.
[266.30s -> 267.18s]  It's not even two o'clock.
[267.18s -> 267.90s]  We're fine.
[267.90s -> 269.26s]  I sent you an invite.
[269.26s -> 272.50s]  Okay.
[272.50s -> 273.30s]  Accepted an invite.
[274.18s -> 276.65s]  Hey, I have a question.
[276.65s -> 278.97s]  I actually have like I'm deeply curious.
[278.97s -> 279.53s]  Hold on.
[279.53s -> 281.61s]  Because I got to show the actual stream.
[282.33s -> 283.29s]  I was already doing the wall.
[284.09s -> 284.57s]  Yeah.
[284.57s -> 284.89s]  All right.
[284.89s -> 285.61s]  Anyways, I got this.
[285.61s -> 288.33s]  Can you can you like talk a little bit to like make sure I get the audio levels?
[293.32s -> 294.68s]  Okay, I think I think it's good.
[297.18s -> 297.34s]  All right.
[297.34s -> 298.30s]  So what was your question?
[299.02s -> 302.86s]  Um, so whenever like you're like, oh, hey, like stern drummer are going to do a stream.
[302.86s -> 307.02s]  They come into my offline chat and they'll type exclamation point sus.
[307.66s -> 308.94s]  So I'm curious.
[308.94s -> 311.56s]  Like I, you know, me and you, we're going to know.
[311.56s -> 312.52s]  We know where that joke comes from.
[312.52s -> 315.32s]  But do people think now that that's like an Among Us reference?
[315.32s -> 315.48s]  Yeah.
[315.48s -> 316.28s]  Oh, yeah, they do.
[317.00s -> 317.32s]  Okay.
[317.32s -> 317.96s]  That's sad.
[317.96s -> 319.08s]  That's very disappointing.
[319.08s -> 319.56s]  All right.
[319.56s -> 321.32s]  That that is an Among Us reference.
[321.32s -> 323.56s]  Well, we took to the old viewers.
[323.56s -> 329.29s]  No, they know nothing of Annalander.
[329.29s -> 330.25s]  I mean, that's a great game.
[330.81s -> 332.57s]  Have you ever played that game like on stream?
[333.96s -> 336.79s]  Uh, I think I played through the first two.
[336.79s -> 337.75s]  You really should.
[337.75s -> 341.27s]  I mean, you're going to hate it, but you're going to like probably love it at the same time.
[341.27s -> 343.83s]  You're going to love certain aspects of that game, but you're going to like,
[343.83s -> 347.27s]  I just told you I played the first two and you're telling me like I've never you're all you're going
[347.27s -> 347.51s]  to know.
[347.51s -> 348.55s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[348.55s -> 349.03s]  There's a difference.
[349.03s -> 350.15s]  The first two are good.
[350.15s -> 354.55s]  The second, the third and the fourth are are very all over the place.
[355.72s -> 360.07s]  The fourth one is I would consider the worst of the of the four that you're going to hate it.
[360.07s -> 360.63s]  They're the worst.
[360.63s -> 361.59s]  You're going to hate it.
[361.59s -> 363.59s]  You're going to come to me and be like, why don't you tell me to play that?
[363.59s -> 364.79s]  Here's all the things wrong with it.
[365.35s -> 367.35s]  You're going to give me like a list of shit that's wrong with that game.
[368.07s -> 370.98s]  Are you ready for Dying Light 2?
[370.98s -> 371.78s]  I'm in the game.
[372.90s -> 373.14s]  All right.
[373.14s -> 376.42s]  So the story so far, we just jumped in.
[377.38s -> 380.10s]  We had to get the thing, the marker for our arm.
[380.66s -> 382.98s]  And does anybody really care?
[382.98s -> 385.22s]  Or do you just want us to go walk around and like, and hit each other with like,
[385.22s -> 388.02s]  I skipped every single possible cut.
[389.30s -> 389.86s]  I okay.
[389.86s -> 391.30s]  I kind of know what's going on.
[392.70s -> 392.86s]  Yeah.
[392.86s -> 394.94s]  So you meet this guy and you're running with him and he's like, yeah,
[394.94s -> 397.18s]  back before the place hit and you do all that stuff.
[397.18s -> 397.74s]  Wrong game.
[397.74s -> 398.54s]  Like, let's go.
[399.18s -> 402.94s]  You're like, you are the vaccine man because someone has to be a vaccine guy
[402.94s -> 405.26s]  or like experimental zombie.
[405.26s -> 405.90s]  And that's us.
[405.90s -> 410.38s]  And now we, uh, now we're going to do like parkour on zombies.
[410.38s -> 410.54s]  All right.
[410.54s -> 411.02s]  So we need to meet.
[411.02s -> 413.26s]  We need to meet the people of the, uh, of the Bazaar.
[414.73s -> 414.97s]  Yeah.
[414.97s -> 415.77s]  I talked to you first.
[418.10s -> 419.62s]  Anybody just talk to anybody.
[419.62s -> 421.62s]  I got, I got stuck on this quest.
[421.62s -> 422.50s]  You got stuck on this?
[423.22s -> 423.46s]  Yeah.
[423.46s -> 424.66s]  Did you not do this?
[424.66s -> 427.62s]  No, I once I was able to do, um, multiplayer.
[427.62s -> 428.10s]  I just left.
[428.66s -> 428.98s]  Okay.
[428.98s -> 432.74s]  Well, I came to a safe zone because I thought we'd have to be in a safe zone for me to invite
[432.74s -> 432.98s]  you.
[432.98s -> 436.42s]  And then it asked me to meet the people and I walked around and tried to talk to everyone
[436.42s -> 437.46s]  for like 15 minutes.
[438.18s -> 438.42s]  Okay.
[439.06s -> 440.52s]  Should I buy this?
[441.24s -> 441.96s]  I don't have any money.
[442.92s -> 445.64s]  Sell all valuables for $700.
[445.64s -> 446.20s]  Should I do that?
[446.84s -> 448.92s]  All right.
[448.92s -> 449.88s]  Well, I'm going to how to trade.
[449.88s -> 450.12s]  Okay.
[450.76s -> 454.07s]  You have to do the two quests.
[454.07s -> 455.58s]  All right.
[455.58s -> 456.62s]  So who do I talk to?
[456.62s -> 458.14s]  This is so loud for me.
[458.14s -> 458.86s]  I'm sorry, guys.
[459.66s -> 465.02s]  I know everybody like gets, everybody hates how quiet my like game audio is, but I have
[465.02s -> 466.62s]  to drop it because it's too loud for me.
[467.26s -> 471.53s]  All right.
[471.53s -> 472.17s]  So where are we going?
[472.73s -> 476.49s]  I think, I think we're going to do like a side quest or something.
[476.49s -> 478.49s]  Meet the people of the bizarre.
[478.49s -> 479.21s]  There's not, nobody here.
[479.21s -> 480.41s]  We have to talk to individually.
[480.41s -> 481.53s]  I talked to them.
[481.53s -> 482.81s]  I got a few side quests.
[482.81s -> 487.53s]  We can just like, let's just leave and like, you know, find our own way in this vast open
[487.53s -> 487.85s]  world.
[487.85s -> 491.77s]  I don't think we, dude, we can't leave until we talk to the right people.
[491.77s -> 494.33s]  One of the only way out.
[494.33s -> 495.61s]  Meet people in the bizarre.
[495.61s -> 497.13s]  What we can just leave.
[498.49s -> 500.33s]  The only way out is talk to us.
[500.33s -> 501.77s]  Oh, that's the quest name.
[501.77s -> 502.01s]  All right.
[502.01s -> 502.33s]  Let's go.
[502.33s -> 503.13s]  Funny stuff.
[503.13s -> 505.21s]  I can't, I can't hit you.
[505.21s -> 505.37s]  Yeah.
[505.37s -> 506.57s]  Because we're in like a safe zone.
[506.57s -> 507.45s]  You can't use weapons here.
[507.45s -> 509.05s]  So all right.
[509.05s -> 510.18s]  This is the front door.
[511.06s -> 512.63s]  We got something.
[512.63s -> 516.10s]  It's a main story.
[525.08s -> 527.61s]  Oh yeah.
[527.61s -> 528.41s]  That's the whole plot.
[528.41s -> 532.65s]  All you need to know is we're looking for a girlfriend.
[533.72s -> 534.36s]  We're looking.
[534.36s -> 534.60s]  Okay.
[539.21s -> 539.53s]  Okay.
[539.53s -> 541.05s]  So we, we met that person.
[542.95s -> 544.55s]  Now let's go meet somebody else over here.
[544.55s -> 545.75s]  Let me, I'll tell you something.
[547.94s -> 549.38s]  You correct me from wrong history.
[550.47s -> 554.39s]  Is this game like in this game is very well optimized for me.
[554.39s -> 557.27s]  Like it runs at like a lightning fast, a hundred frames a second, no matter what.
[557.99s -> 559.11s]  Lightning fast.
[559.11s -> 564.07s]  Like I played Watch Dogs Legion and, and it was one of the worst experiences of my entire life.
[564.71s -> 568.79s]  If I alt tab, I can't click any of my other windows.
[569.19s -> 571.11s]  Is my experience like OBS.
[571.11s -> 573.91s]  I can't minimize or adjust in any way.
[573.91s -> 574.15s]  Yeah.
[574.15s -> 575.19s]  But the game looks great though.
[576.95s -> 577.75s]  Who paid you?
[577.75s -> 578.87s]  We got to go down.
[578.87s -> 579.27s]  Nobody.
[580.07s -> 581.62s]  Oh, we have to go in here.
[581.62s -> 581.86s]  All right.
[581.86s -> 583.06s]  So it does.
[583.78s -> 585.91s]  Oh, that's great.
[585.91s -> 587.59s]  Like I remember that first part when you're looking at the,
[588.71s -> 589.91s]  like all the trees and shit.
[589.91s -> 591.35s]  It was, it was blown away.
[591.35s -> 594.95s]  Game would be trash after all the delays and all those bad press it got.
[596.95s -> 597.19s]  Yeah.
[597.83s -> 599.67s]  I'm, I'm not going to say shit.
[599.67s -> 601.19s]  We usually talk shit about games.
[601.19s -> 601.75s]  That's what we do.
[601.75s -> 602.39s]  That's like our thing.
[603.99s -> 606.15s]  We have our little podcast that we do here once in a while.
[606.15s -> 607.11s]  And you're about to bet.
[607.11s -> 607.35s]  Okay.
[607.35s -> 608.23s]  But I'm about to get mad.
[609.35s -> 610.87s]  How the fuck do we just progress this?
[612.62s -> 613.90s]  I can like choose.
[615.45s -> 616.41s]  You have to do something.
[616.41s -> 617.69s]  Am I just like a guy that's here?
[617.69s -> 620.49s]  Like as your sidekick, like where I don't have like a quest marker.
[620.49s -> 620.81s]  Do you?
[623.70s -> 626.18s]  I think I can change our current question.
[626.18s -> 628.97s]  Well, so we have to meet in the bizarre.
[634.42s -> 637.14s]  Peacekeepers closed off the passage to the city center to get there.
[637.86s -> 639.78s]  Con and I had to find a way around the patrols.
[639.78s -> 641.14s]  Meet the people of the bizarre.
[642.66s -> 643.46s]  They're in front of us.
[643.46s -> 643.78s]  All right.
[643.78s -> 644.18s]  Hi.
[644.18s -> 645.06s]  How do we leave?
[645.06s -> 645.22s]  Yeah.
[645.22s -> 645.46s]  Okay.
[645.46s -> 645.86s]  Well, okay.
[645.86s -> 646.26s]  Cheers.
[646.26s -> 646.66s]  Let's go.
[647.62s -> 648.10s]  New quest.
[648.82s -> 649.06s]  What?
[650.14s -> 650.54s]  Cheers.
[650.54s -> 652.38s]  Find Marco the water supplier.
[653.10s -> 653.66s]  Oh, nice.
[654.46s -> 655.98s]  I want somebody to calm down.
[655.98s -> 656.22s]  All right.
[656.22s -> 657.10s]  I'm coming down.
[657.10s -> 658.62s]  You're looking for water chips.
[658.62s -> 658.86s]  All right.
[658.86s -> 659.26s]  Are we ready?
[665.75s -> 667.43s]  So, oh, now I got my bad.
[667.43s -> 667.83s]  Cool.
[667.83s -> 668.23s]  Don't even.
[668.95s -> 670.39s]  Oh, come on, man.
[670.39s -> 670.63s]  Don't it.
[670.63s -> 671.19s]  You're going to swing it.
[671.19s -> 671.67s]  You can hit me.
[671.67s -> 672.23s]  Friendly fire.
[673.21s -> 673.45s]  It's not.
[673.45s -> 674.09s]  It doesn't exist.
[674.65s -> 678.39s]  All right.
[678.39s -> 678.87s]  Where are we going?
[682.70s -> 683.98s]  You can't hit anybody.
[683.98s -> 684.22s]  Yeah.
[684.22s -> 685.42s]  I broke my weapon on him.
[686.86s -> 690.98s]  What is this?
[691.62s -> 693.46s]  Wait, he's not zombies.
[693.46s -> 694.26s]  Well, that was just a guy.
[695.14s -> 696.10s]  You got to clear them out.
[696.82s -> 699.38s]  It's just a person going through the trash.
[700.26s -> 700.90s]  Who does that?
[702.50s -> 703.78s]  You're all just going through the trash.
[705.46s -> 706.90s]  I don't think we're supposed to be doing this.
[708.10s -> 709.22s]  I'm from Austin.
[709.22s -> 710.10s]  That's what we do here.
[711.80s -> 712.04s]  What?
[712.68s -> 715.11s]  We got to go get the water chips.
[718.23s -> 718.71s]  Where is it?
[721.32s -> 722.84s]  Do you not have the objective markers?
[722.84s -> 723.24s]  Oh, I do.
[723.24s -> 723.72s]  Yeah, I do.
[724.76s -> 726.44s]  Why are you hurting innocent people?
[726.44s -> 727.08s]  What happened?
[727.08s -> 727.88s]  Wait, are these?
[727.88s -> 728.92s]  Can we talk to these people?
[730.14s -> 732.30s]  Oh, trying to talk after the opponent.
[735.56s -> 736.52s]  Wait, what's going on?
[738.65s -> 739.53s]  These are zombies here.
[741.61s -> 742.41s]  No, not that guy.
[742.41s -> 743.45s]  That's a normal guy.
[743.45s -> 744.01s]  It's a guy.
[745.29s -> 747.30s]  We are not supposed to be.
[747.30s -> 747.70s]  All right.
[747.70s -> 749.14s]  Don't stop hitting innocent people.
[750.97s -> 753.05s]  That guy ran away and said, who did that?
[760.76s -> 761.16s]  All right.
[761.16s -> 762.04s]  Let's focus here.
[762.04s -> 763.24s]  We need to focus on focus.
[763.88s -> 765.08s]  Turn off the health bars.
[765.08s -> 765.40s]  Hold on.
[765.40s -> 765.72s]  Hold up.
[766.44s -> 767.24s]  Don't don't don't.
[767.24s -> 768.36s]  I'm going to get this unkindled.
[770.38s -> 776.02s]  I love how they added metal gear solid neck breaks to the zombies.
[776.02s -> 776.34s]  Watch out.
[776.34s -> 776.82s]  Watch out guy.
[776.82s -> 777.22s]  Come right in.
[777.94s -> 787.11s]  Honestly, they're like so like you feel bad.
[789.98s -> 790.86s]  You hold on.
[790.86s -> 792.54s]  You feel bad for the zombies that you're killing,
[792.54s -> 794.30s]  but not for like the regular innocent people
[794.30s -> 795.66s]  that you hit that were in the trash can.
[796.22s -> 797.66s]  They can defend themselves.
[797.66s -> 798.62s]  These zombies cannot.
[801.67s -> 803.91s]  All right, so we have to get.
[804.95s -> 805.75s]  Okay, let's go.
[805.75s -> 806.79s]  Okay, let's focus.
[806.79s -> 807.51s]  Focus.
[807.51s -> 808.95s]  Mark number one.
[808.95s -> 809.59s]  Follow me, runner.
[809.59s -> 810.07s]  All right, fine.
[810.07s -> 810.39s]  Let's go.
[811.35s -> 814.31s]  If you guys don't know, Dying Light 2 has some parkouring in it.
[814.31s -> 816.79s]  It's all about staying on the rooftop, staying away from danger.
[817.69s -> 821.21s]  I'm trying to find your way above a roof to roof.
[821.21s -> 822.73s]  You don't want to alert the horde.
[823.05s -> 824.97s]  That's a big problem in this game.
[824.97s -> 825.93s]  Got to be very careful.
[828.39s -> 830.63s]  It's actually pretty fluid experience so far.
[830.63s -> 832.07s]  Jumping from place to place.
[832.79s -> 835.54s]  But we're going to give it the real review here.
[836.10s -> 837.46s]  I'm not going to be like those other reviewers.
[837.46s -> 839.22s]  We're not going to be like those other people that you watch.
[839.22s -> 841.38s]  We're not going to go into real, real super detail.
[843.19s -> 847.03s]  Yeah, we're going to do some detailed talking about this game and what it means.
[849.99s -> 851.75s]  Yeah, why is this weapon broken?
[852.71s -> 856.39s]  My game is not suddenly when we're fighting things.
[861.54s -> 862.70s]  Wait, you can jump on.
[862.70s -> 863.10s]  Oh, wait, wait.
[863.10s -> 863.98s]  I remember this in the tutorial.
[863.98s -> 865.10s]  Ready?
[865.10s -> 867.27s]  That didn't do anything.
[867.99s -> 870.90s]  Ready?
[870.90s -> 873.08s]  I can do it.
[873.08s -> 873.88s]  You can do a drop kick.
[873.88s -> 874.20s]  Watch this.
[875.00s -> 875.40s]  Watch it.
[876.04s -> 876.20s]  What?
[879.19s -> 880.81s]  Is that you?
[880.81s -> 881.61s]  Oh, shit.
[881.61s -> 882.33s]  I thought that was you.
[883.13s -> 887.99s]  What's going on?
[890.95s -> 892.15s]  Why are we killing normal people?
[893.11s -> 893.67s]  I don't know.
[900.73s -> 901.37s]  Yeah, you're right.
[901.37s -> 903.61s]  In combat, my frames are dropping a little bit.
[903.61s -> 904.41s]  Not very much, though.
[905.13s -> 906.26s]  I heal up.
[910.14s -> 912.90s]  Can you guys play games normally, please?
[914.74s -> 916.82s]  What did we do abnormal so far?
[916.82s -> 918.02s]  We just killed a few people.
[918.02s -> 918.66s]  Wait, lockpicks.
[922.94s -> 923.66s]  Are you good at these?
[923.66s -> 924.78s]  I'm usually not that great at this.
[926.98s -> 928.18s]  How can you be bad at it?
[928.18s -> 928.66s]  You did it.
[928.66s -> 929.54s]  You're good.
[929.54s -> 930.90s]  You gotta have confidence.
[930.90s -> 932.18s]  I thought this said coffee sneakers,
[932.18s -> 932.90s]  and I was about to do it.
[937.02s -> 937.98s]  Do you get something in there, too?
[938.62s -> 942.78s]  Yeah, coffee sneakers.
[942.78s -> 944.06s]  You actually get this?
[944.06s -> 944.38s]  Yeah, yeah.
[944.38s -> 945.10s]  Do we share loot?
[945.10s -> 945.42s]  Okay.
[945.42s -> 945.98s]  Yeah.
[945.98s -> 946.22s]  Okay.
[946.22s -> 946.78s]  All right, cool.
[946.78s -> 947.34s]  So.
[947.34s -> 947.82s]  All right, cool.
[947.82s -> 948.06s]  Yeah.
[948.06s -> 948.78s]  Can you make the X?
[954.55s -> 956.71s]  That does not look like it would be safe at all.
[957.27s -> 959.51s]  It's one single spring mattress.
[960.15s -> 961.51s]  If you put a Tempur-Pedic down here,
[961.51s -> 963.11s]  it would still break all your bones.
[963.75s -> 964.47s]  This is bullshit.
[965.03s -> 966.07s]  You can't even break down.
[969.43s -> 970.71s]  I mean, I can, but not anymore.
[971.43s -> 972.23s]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[976.31s -> 978.79s]  I seriously, why are you choking outside?
[978.79s -> 980.31s]  Wait, how did you flip it on me?
[980.31s -> 981.35s]  He started choking you.
[984.20s -> 985.48s]  He's like, get out of here.
[985.48s -> 986.36s]  I'll do that to you.
[987.00s -> 990.78s]  Probably didn't mash out.
[990.78s -> 992.78s]  Okay, dude, can you land on the bed of that truck?
[994.55s -> 995.59s]  Okay, I guess maybe.
[997.90s -> 998.94s]  Land on the bed of the truck.
[999.50s -> 1000.49s]  Why?
[1000.49s -> 1002.01s]  Oh my God, that guy's coming up there.
[1002.01s -> 1003.05s]  That guy's so better than you.
[1004.01s -> 1006.84s]  They have bow and arrows.
[1007.56s -> 1009.40s]  They're throwing daggers or something.
[1009.40s -> 1010.68s]  They're ignoring the zombie.
[1010.68s -> 1014.06s]  Oh, what the fuck was that?
[1015.19s -> 1015.67s]  I got you.
[1018.22s -> 1018.94s]  It kind of worked.
[1020.38s -> 1021.42s]  I just got the guy's head off.
[1022.14s -> 1029.56s]  Make sure you're looking for, hit your gamer sense
[1029.56s -> 1031.56s]  because you need to craft stuff in this game.
[1031.56s -> 1033.91s]  It's a bit of a looter crafter.
[1033.91s -> 1035.03s]  It's kind of like Breath of the Wild.
[1036.07s -> 1037.11s]  Wait, he's fighting the zombie.
[1037.43s -> 1047.78s]  Oh, don't watch your stamina bar.
[1055.86s -> 1056.98s]  Why is the game so juicy?
[1057.86s -> 1059.38s]  It is really juicy, isn't it?
[1059.38s -> 1060.66s]  It's very like chunky.
[1060.66s -> 1061.94s]  A little bit creamy, a little bit.
[1062.58s -> 1064.81s]  Okay, so we keep going.
[1065.61s -> 1066.81s]  This is 200.
[1066.81s -> 1067.85s]  How far away is this?
[1071.96s -> 1073.32s]  Don't aggro the horde.
[1073.88s -> 1074.65s]  I'm not.
[1078.15s -> 1079.11s]  It's really creamy.
[1080.17s -> 1096.92s]  I'm turning it down again.
[1100.92s -> 1101.64s]  Our attacks.
[1102.44s -> 1103.56s]  Oh, that's right.
[1103.56s -> 1104.04s]  You have to dodge.
[1107.51s -> 1109.43s]  You hold the direction in space.
[1109.43s -> 1110.79s]  You'll do a Dark Souls dodge.
[1115.91s -> 1120.55s]  Yeah, I think you should.
[1121.27s -> 1123.03s]  We actually probably need to be looking for stuff
[1123.03s -> 1124.87s]  because look, I mean, like you go up in trash cans
[1124.87s -> 1126.23s]  and take scrap and stuff.
[1126.23s -> 1127.59s]  Why are we rushing through?
[1127.59s -> 1129.59s]  We've been waiting for this game for like seven years.
[1130.31s -> 1131.35s]  Have we?
[1131.35s -> 1133.59s]  You and I, we've talked about like, man,
[1133.59s -> 1136.31s]  that fucking dying light tunnel troll
[1136.31s -> 1137.83s]  and coffee and Cheetos and stuff.
[1137.83s -> 1138.87s]  We've been waiting for this shit.
[1140.46s -> 1142.86s]  All right, well, let's take some time role play
[1142.86s -> 1145.66s]  and make sure we really engross ourselves
[1145.66s -> 1146.94s]  into the environment.
[1146.94s -> 1147.82s]  Remember the guy?
[1147.82s -> 1148.54s]  Oh, I got to get home.
[1148.54s -> 1149.10s]  I got to get home.
[1149.10s -> 1149.90s]  My mom's going to kill me.
[1149.90s -> 1151.66s]  Remember the guy outside that was running away?
[1151.66s -> 1152.62s]  He was like the big zombie guy
[1152.62s -> 1153.66s]  and he ran into the fence.
[1153.66s -> 1153.98s]  Remember?
[1159.51s -> 1161.19s]  All right, we need to craft those.
[1162.94s -> 1166.28s]  You actually don't remember.
[1166.28s -> 1167.88s]  That was like one of the funniest things
[1167.88s -> 1171.78s]  in any of the videos we ever made.
[1171.78s -> 1173.94s]  It was like this special super infected guy
[1173.94s -> 1174.66s]  and it was light out.
[1174.66s -> 1176.58s]  Oh, that fell into the fence.
[1176.58s -> 1178.10s]  He ran into the fence and died.
[1178.10s -> 1183.70s]  Just say it already.
[1183.70s -> 1185.30s]  No, I'm not just going to say it
[1185.30s -> 1186.74s]  because we're in the game's sequel.
[1186.74s -> 1189.22s]  We have to actually find the thing for me to say it.
[1196.44s -> 1197.56s]  Everybody's waiting.
[1198.12s -> 1199.82s]  We got to go save that guy over there.
[1199.82s -> 1201.58s]  That guy's looking like he's in a little bit of danger.
[1201.58s -> 1201.98s]  Which one?
[1204.54s -> 1205.02s]  Oh, yeah.
[1210.76s -> 1211.88s]  This guy's a zombie.
[1211.88s -> 1215.61s]  I feel like all these bandits are just getting along.
[1215.61s -> 1216.49s]  Oh shit, I'm going to die.
[1217.37s -> 1219.82s]  Yeah, we got to craft this.
[1219.82s -> 1223.40s]  This game looks like New Vegas.
[1225.16s -> 1225.80s]  Am I crouching?
[1233.98s -> 1237.38s]  What are you even doing?
[1244.66s -> 1247.38s]  Like everybody's just swinging melee weapons
[1247.38s -> 1248.26s]  at each other outside.
[1250.42s -> 1252.10s]  Yeah, it just feels like Mordhau.
[1262.25s -> 1265.05s]  All we need is to press like the E mode button and go.
[1267.05s -> 1273.14s]  And then get vote kicked out of the server.
[1275.69s -> 1276.17s]  Where are you?
[1276.81s -> 1278.73s]  I'm right here hitting the guy in the Mordhau.
[1280.33s -> 1284.17s]  Okay, so let's go.
[1284.89s -> 1285.53s]  Hey, let's go up.
[1285.53s -> 1286.49s]  We got to stay on the rooftop.
[1286.49s -> 1288.25s]  Let's kind of get a little bit of parkour.
[1288.81s -> 1289.37s]  Oh, you're right.
[1289.37s -> 1290.01s]  Hold on.
[1290.01s -> 1290.33s]  You're right.
[1290.33s -> 1291.53s]  We do have to stay on the rooftops.
[1293.46s -> 1294.26s]  Shit's too loud.
[1294.26s -> 1295.86s]  I know people are going to be mad at me for this,
[1295.86s -> 1296.34s]  but whatever.
[1296.34s -> 1297.06s]  It's too loud for me.
[1304.63s -> 1307.43s]  Is there actually somebody up there?
[1318.22s -> 1319.42s]  Wait, I thought there were zombies.
[1319.42s -> 1319.90s]  I thought there was.
[1319.90s -> 1320.38s]  I didn't wait.
[1320.38s -> 1320.62s]  What?
[1321.82s -> 1323.74s]  I thought they were actually zombies.
[1324.79s -> 1327.27s]  I thought they were like monsters.
[1327.27s -> 1328.15s]  All right, we got to get out of here.
[1328.15s -> 1328.55s]  We got to leave.
[1329.91s -> 1330.47s]  We have to leave.
[1333.96s -> 1335.62s]  We have to get out of here.
[1335.62s -> 1336.58s]  That guy just walked off.
[1336.58s -> 1337.22s]  I didn't do that.
[1339.22s -> 1340.02s]  Where'd shit go?
[1340.90s -> 1343.46s]  Is he going to follow?
[1350.52s -> 1355.37s]  When do we get guns?
[1359.54s -> 1360.26s]  This is fun.
[1360.26s -> 1360.82s]  What is this?
[1361.38s -> 1362.26s]  We got to defeat that.
[1362.98s -> 1363.70s]  That guy's getting fucked up.
[1363.70s -> 1364.42s]  Get him.
[1364.42s -> 1364.98s]  Oh, go, go.
[1367.70s -> 1368.66s]  I just broke my leg.
[1369.62s -> 1370.26s]  He's running.
[1371.06s -> 1371.94s]  Why is he running?
[1372.66s -> 1376.18s]  I don't understand.
[1377.14s -> 1378.10s]  He just beat that guy up.
[1378.10s -> 1378.66s]  He's a thief.
[1383.26s -> 1384.14s]  Murder him.
[1384.14s -> 1384.70s]  Murder him.
[1386.07s -> 1387.03s]  You cut his head off.
[1387.99s -> 1388.95s]  Bandit caught.
[1388.95s -> 1390.63s]  Bandit decapitated.
[1390.63s -> 1390.87s]  What?
[1391.75s -> 1393.32s]  What do they have on him?
[1393.32s -> 1395.40s]  A little bit of street justice.
[1395.40s -> 1396.04s]  Oh, my God.
[1397.64s -> 1398.12s]  He had some...
[1398.92s -> 1400.60s]  You have collected a new collectible.
[1408.94s -> 1410.70s]  Every weapon I have is broken.
[1410.70s -> 1412.17s]  Are we not...
[1412.17s -> 1412.49s]  Okay.
[1413.21s -> 1415.21s]  Are we not supposed to be...
[1415.21s -> 1416.49s]  I have like a cane.
[1417.13s -> 1419.02s]  I don't think we're supposed to be
[1419.02s -> 1420.14s]  just whacking people with these.
[1420.14s -> 1420.94s]  I think we need them.
[1421.82s -> 1422.94s]  Need them for what?
[1422.94s -> 1423.26s]  I don't...
[1423.26s -> 1424.94s]  I mean, do you have any other weapons?
[1424.94s -> 1425.74s]  I don't.
[1425.74s -> 1426.60s]  I've got...
[1426.60s -> 1427.40s]  I think I got two.
[1428.04s -> 1431.69s]  I mean, we're still doing it.
[1431.69s -> 1433.45s]  I have like tiny Tim's cane.
[1434.33s -> 1436.17s]  You're like beating up a random zombie.
[1436.17s -> 1438.41s]  There's a guy in a ski mask waiting for me.
[1439.45s -> 1445.05s]  All right.
[1445.05s -> 1445.61s]  We need to...
[1445.61s -> 1446.49s]  I'm leaving.
[1446.49s -> 1446.97s]  I'm running away.
[1447.53s -> 1448.65s]  We're going to the quest marker
[1448.65s -> 1450.49s]  because we're going to break all of our weapons.
[1450.49s -> 1451.37s]  Okay, okay.
[1451.37s -> 1452.89s]  We got to go on the rooftops, Sharma.
[1452.89s -> 1454.25s]  This is a little bit of a parkour game.
[1454.25s -> 1454.73s]  Oh, that's right.
[1454.73s -> 1454.97s]  That's right.
[1454.97s -> 1455.37s]  That's right.
[1455.37s -> 1457.29s]  It's parkour kind of experience.
[1457.29s -> 1462.84s]  I know the route.
[1462.84s -> 1463.56s]  Come on, pow down.
[1471.16s -> 1472.44s]  Did you make an arcane reference?
[1473.85s -> 1474.57s]  It's what's hip.
[1474.57s -> 1475.53s]  You got to stay relevant.
[1476.09s -> 1480.74s]  I only know that because I saw the first two episodes.
[1482.47s -> 1483.51s]  And you didn't watch the rest?
[1485.05s -> 1487.53s]  I mean, I probably will eventually.
[1487.53s -> 1489.05s]  I always watch like one episode of TV
[1489.05s -> 1489.93s]  and then never watch it again.
[1499.18s -> 1500.54s]  This game is so crunchy.
[1502.14s -> 1504.09s]  Why would he die?
[1509.66s -> 1513.59s]  Okay. League of Legends Andy.
[1513.59s -> 1514.79s]  I'm not the one that made the reference.
[1514.79s -> 1515.51s]  He did.
[1515.51s -> 1521.46s]  Oh, you're talking about a lot.
[1521.46s -> 1521.70s]  All right.
[1521.70s -> 1523.54s]  But look, before we go any further.
[1524.50s -> 1525.70s]  I need to make it really clear.
[1525.70s -> 1526.74s]  You're running.
[1527.46s -> 1529.40s]  I'm right here.
[1529.40s -> 1532.95s]  When a game has really beautiful trees,
[1533.67s -> 1534.87s]  that's usually an indicator
[1534.87s -> 1536.95s]  that it's going to run at like 15 frames a second.
[1536.95s -> 1537.83s]  Is that wrong or not?
[1540.97s -> 1544.22s]  I guess that's a fair assessment.
[1544.22s -> 1546.46s]  Every time I've ever played a game
[1547.02s -> 1549.26s]  where it was like, look at how detailed our environment is.
[1549.26s -> 1550.62s]  We have these big lush trees
[1550.62s -> 1552.14s]  with all kinds of particle effects.
[1552.14s -> 1554.30s]  It runs at like 12 frames a second.
[1554.30s -> 1555.58s]  And you have to turn all that shit down
[1555.58s -> 1557.37s]  and get it to even run.
[1557.37s -> 1560.84s]  This came out of the box running at like 60 for me.
[1563.98s -> 1565.34s]  We have to give credit where it's due.
[1565.34s -> 1565.82s]  I have to.
[1566.54s -> 1568.65s]  Okay.
[1568.65s -> 1569.29s]  And look at this.
[1570.52s -> 1572.04s]  This is beautiful.
[1572.60s -> 1574.28s]  You got a 30-90, 30-90 moment.
[1575.00s -> 1576.60s]  Yeah, the glowing sea.
[1576.60s -> 1577.40s]  You don't want to go through there.
[1578.12s -> 1579.32s]  Ster, what do you have for a graphics card?
[1580.44s -> 1581.24s]  280 Ti.
[1582.28s -> 1584.20s]  And you're running at pretty much like 60, right?
[1586.23s -> 1589.13s]  I have issues.
[1590.81s -> 1592.57s]  Generally speaking, I've got some issues.
[1593.53s -> 1593.93s]  In general?
[1593.93s -> 1594.73s]  Nothing to do with the game.
[1594.73s -> 1597.64s]  The game, I mean, we've got to give credit
[1597.64s -> 1598.68s]  where credit's due, apparently.
[1599.32s -> 1600.36s]  I am dead serious.
[1600.36s -> 1603.32s]  I am so sick and fucking goddamn tired
[1603.32s -> 1605.88s]  of games coming out that are AAA games
[1605.88s -> 1607.80s]  that are, whoa, look at how beautiful.
[1607.80s -> 1609.40s]  And they run like shit and they crash
[1609.40s -> 1611.24s]  and they don't even work.
[1611.24s -> 1613.32s]  This is like unheard of to me.
[1613.32s -> 1614.76s]  When was the last time you played a game
[1614.76s -> 1617.11s]  that came out in current year?
[1617.11s -> 1621.05s]  Watch Dogs Legion.
[1621.05s -> 1625.18s]  Okay, then yeah, what you're saying is valid.
[1625.18s -> 1627.50s]  Any major AAA game I played in the last two, three years
[1627.50s -> 1629.42s]  always kind of ran like dog shit, always.
[1631.21s -> 1632.01s]  This game could suck.
[1632.01s -> 1632.33s]  I don't know.
[1632.33s -> 1633.13s]  We have no idea.
[1633.13s -> 1635.05s]  Oh, wait, what's this?
[1641.91s -> 1643.67s]  We're going in the wrong direction.
[1643.67s -> 1644.71s]  I got to turn you up a little bit.
[1647.03s -> 1648.47s]  We're going the wrong direction?
[1648.47s -> 1649.43s]  Yeah, we got to go this way.
[1649.43s -> 1650.79s]  Watch out, there's heads.
[1650.79s -> 1653.90s]  Okay, so there's special gear.
[1657.27s -> 1660.97s]  All right, so we got, oh, climb up stuff.
[1660.97s -> 1664.62s]  What about Resident Evil 8?
[1666.26s -> 1668.18s]  Yeah, Resident Evil 8 was all right, too.
[1668.18s -> 1671.62s]  But was that like 70 FOV?
[1672.26s -> 1674.02s]  I ran out of, I need help.
[1674.58s -> 1675.94s]  Help, you need help me?
[1678.76s -> 1680.12s]  Why do I have no stamina?
[1680.76s -> 1684.28s]  I have to take your inhibitor.
[1684.28s -> 1685.86s]  Do I actually have to do that?
[1686.42s -> 1692.07s]  Oh, no, I got it.
[1692.71s -> 1698.09s]  I think we're going to get in the building.
[1698.09s -> 1699.53s]  Okay, very cool.
[1699.53s -> 1700.09s]  Up top, maybe?
[1700.09s -> 1700.89s]  Watch out, they're climbing.
[1700.89s -> 1701.69s]  We got climbers.
[1702.25s -> 1704.50s]  There's a book over there.
[1707.64s -> 1710.98s]  Dad here.
[1715.10s -> 1715.74s]  He's running.
[1716.54s -> 1717.74s]  He doesn't want anything to do with this.
[1718.71s -> 1718.87s]  What?
[1718.87s -> 1719.75s]  Nobody can do that.
[1729.54s -> 1730.90s]  He was so scared.
[1730.90s -> 1731.70s]  That's kind of crunchy.
[1732.50s -> 1733.54s]  This game's really creepy.
[1735.94s -> 1738.02s]  I feel like when we're interacting with NPCs,
[1738.02s -> 1740.02s]  I feel like we're seeing two different things happening.
[1740.82s -> 1743.62s]  That guy walked off the pole for me.
[1744.26s -> 1746.66s]  Yeah, he teleported to the pole for me and then fell off.
[1746.66s -> 1748.42s]  Oh, he ran across and then fell.
[1749.14s -> 1752.38s]  Watch out, we're inside the quest area.
[1753.10s -> 1754.30s]  He's just a five percent.
[1754.30s -> 1755.66s]  We have five minutes to do this, by the way,
[1755.66s -> 1756.70s]  so actually don't mess around.
[1757.50s -> 1758.06s]  Wait, what?
[1758.06s -> 1758.54s]  Why?
[1758.54s -> 1759.34s]  I don't know, it's timed.
[1762.81s -> 1764.33s]  Okay, we start picking up stuff.
[1764.33s -> 1765.85s]  We're going to be so underleveled by the time
[1765.85s -> 1767.61s]  we get to like the end game in the next few hours.
[1768.65s -> 1771.61s]  We're not getting past like level two at this rate.
[1773.05s -> 1775.51s]  Oh, wait, there's more stuff in here.
[1776.71s -> 1778.95s]  Do you see the secret like mine shaft?
[1781.45s -> 1785.26s]  I have like a mine shaft over here.
[1786.33s -> 1786.81s]  Let's go.
[1787.45s -> 1788.57s]  This is one of the hollows.
[1789.29s -> 1790.63s]  Be careful down here.
[1790.63s -> 1791.35s]  We slide?
[1791.35s -> 1792.55s]  I'm losing stamina.
[1792.55s -> 1793.19s]  How do you slide?
[1793.99s -> 1795.66s]  Is this going to hurt?
[1796.54s -> 1797.50s]  Oh, shit, be careful.
[1798.14s -> 1803.50s]  There's a dude.
[1804.06s -> 1805.78s]  Wait, quest?
[1805.78s -> 1807.54s]  All players required.
[1807.54s -> 1808.42s]  We're doing a heist.
[1808.42s -> 1809.14s]  We're doing a heist.
[1809.14s -> 1810.42s]  All right, just let him talk for a second
[1810.42s -> 1811.46s]  until we even know what he's doing here.
[1811.46s -> 1811.96s]  Great.
[1812.42s -> 1817.62s]  Another just what I need between thieves and infected.
[1817.62s -> 1818.90s]  I'll be out of business soon.
[1818.90s -> 1819.38s]  All right, we're good.
[1822.42s -> 1823.46s]  I'm here.
[1823.46s -> 1824.02s]  You just do it.
[1824.02s -> 1825.14s]  It's your you're the host.
[1830.50s -> 1831.06s]  My god.
[1831.78s -> 1834.73s]  Okay.
[1834.73s -> 1835.77s]  Secure the building.
[1835.77s -> 1838.65s]  Find Hans the hunter before he drinks the poisoned water.
[1839.45s -> 1842.15s]  Wait, we have to stop somebody from drinking water.
[1845.86s -> 1846.36s]  Okay.
[1846.90s -> 1848.26s]  That's quite the quest.
[1848.26s -> 1848.74s]  You know what?
[1848.74s -> 1851.62s]  Wait, as a streamer, I'm morally opposed to this.
[1851.62s -> 1852.90s]  You need to stay hydrated.
[1853.62s -> 1855.96s]  Okay, so where are they?
[1860.04s -> 1861.56s]  You know what's funny about games like this, though?
[1861.56s -> 1863.56s]  Okay, so take a look at your perspective.
[1863.56s -> 1864.20s]  Like come over here.
[1864.84s -> 1866.04s]  This is a hiding spot, right?
[1866.60s -> 1867.10s]  Yeah.
[1867.72s -> 1870.26s]  I'm hiding right now.
[1871.06s -> 1873.78s]  This is the equivalent of like a three year old.
[1873.78s -> 1877.35s]  Where'd you go?
[1877.35s -> 1878.07s]  Oh, I see.
[1878.07s -> 1878.57s]  That's funny.
[1879.11s -> 1881.74s]  Okay.
[1881.74s -> 1882.62s]  Okay, ready?
[1882.62s -> 1883.58s]  I'm going to go do the thing.
[1883.58s -> 1884.70s]  I'm going to go into the corner here
[1884.70s -> 1886.22s]  and I'm going to count to 10
[1886.22s -> 1887.66s]  and you be the three year old
[1887.66s -> 1889.82s]  and find the best hiding spot in the room.
[1889.82s -> 1890.32s]  Okay?
[1890.62s -> 1891.02s]  Okay.
[1891.02s -> 1892.38s]  And we're going to do that routine.
[1892.94s -> 1893.34s]  Okay.
[1893.34s -> 1893.98s]  All right, you ready?
[1893.98s -> 1894.62s]  Okay, here we go.
[1896.26s -> 1904.90s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[1904.90s -> 1905.54s]  Here I come.
[1906.18s -> 1908.46s]  And you got to start like this.
[1908.46s -> 1910.62s]  Okay, it's always the okay.
[1912.97s -> 1914.25s]  Wonder where they are.
[1915.05s -> 1916.39s]  Where did he go?
[1919.50s -> 1921.10s]  Not under there.
[1921.10s -> 1922.22s]  Oh, I don't know.
[1923.27s -> 1925.03s]  I have no idea where they are.
[1926.15s -> 1927.59s]  Did they fit in here?
[1927.59s -> 1928.79s]  Oh, no way.
[1930.66s -> 1931.22s]  Okay.
[1932.42s -> 1934.78s]  I found you.
[1934.78s -> 1935.50s]  And then you have to go.
[1936.46s -> 1940.07s]  Okay.
[1940.07s -> 1942.15s]  And then we have to do it again.
[1942.15s -> 1942.63s]  Here we go.
[1942.63s -> 1943.35s]  Ready?
[1943.35s -> 1944.33s]  Here we go.
[1944.33s -> 1945.85s]  Why do we have to do it again?
[1946.97s -> 1953.85s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[1955.29s -> 1956.09s]  Here I come.
[1957.29s -> 1957.93s]  Okay.
[1961.42s -> 1963.98s]  No, you're supposed to be in the same spot.
[1963.98s -> 1965.42s]  The exact same spot.
[1965.42s -> 1965.98s]  You did it wrong.
[1966.54s -> 1968.06s]  I didn't know that was a joke.
[1968.06s -> 1969.02s]  No, that's dangerous.
[1969.02s -> 1969.66s]  Get out of there.
[1971.05s -> 1971.77s]  That's dangerous.
[1971.77s -> 1973.21s]  That's in the drywall.
[1973.21s -> 1974.09s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1974.09s -> 1974.97s]  Come out, come out, come out, come out.
[1974.97s -> 1975.77s]  Oh, my God.
[1975.77s -> 1976.25s]  This is bad.
[1977.14s -> 1978.74s]  Mom, mom, mom.
[1980.20s -> 1981.40s]  Tim went in the drywall.
[1981.40s -> 1982.36s]  I don't know where the fuck they went.
[1982.36s -> 1983.08s]  Mom, I'm serious.
[1983.08s -> 1983.56s]  Zombies.
[1985.50s -> 1985.82s]  Help.
[1985.82s -> 1987.02s]  We got to go find them.
[1987.82s -> 1989.08s]  All right, let's go.
[1989.08s -> 1989.88s]  Help, I'm lost.
[1990.84s -> 1992.04s]  No, don't run in here.
[1994.34s -> 1995.30s]  Why does that door not work?
[1995.94s -> 1996.66s]  It doesn't work.
[1998.47s -> 1999.99s]  That's a that's a bait door.
[2001.03s -> 2003.85s]  All right, do the thing.
[2005.06s -> 2005.54s]  What thing?
[2006.26s -> 2007.46s]  Okay, if you stagger them.
[2008.02s -> 2009.06s]  You can't do it with the zombies.
[2009.06s -> 2010.18s]  You can't carry a zombie.
[2010.18s -> 2011.06s]  Yes, again.
[2011.06s -> 2011.86s]  I just did it.
[2011.86s -> 2016.58s]  Okay, I did it.
[2017.38s -> 2018.92s]  It's a lot harder.
[2019.96s -> 2027.08s]  It's just chivalry.
[2027.08s -> 2028.28s]  I'm not going to be able to get over that
[2028.28s -> 2030.12s]  the whole time we're playing, by the way.
[2030.12s -> 2031.16s]  It's just chivalry.
[2036.10s -> 2037.62s]  Watch out.
[2037.62s -> 2038.42s]  We got Zs.
[2038.42s -> 2039.38s]  No, we can open this.
[2040.26s -> 2041.22s]  Well, that we got to leave.
[2041.22s -> 2042.34s]  That's like leaving now.
[2042.34s -> 2044.07s]  I think that's giving up.
[2044.07s -> 2044.55s]  Are you sure?
[2045.27s -> 2046.55s]  You got to grab my call.
[2046.55s -> 2047.43s]  I'm collecting things.
[2047.43s -> 2048.39s]  I found a Molotov.
[2048.39s -> 2048.79s]  Oh, my God.
[2048.79s -> 2049.43s]  There's a lot of stuff here.
[2049.43s -> 2049.83s]  You're right.
[2053.18s -> 2054.46s]  I found a common bottle.
[2055.62s -> 2056.10s]  A brick.
[2058.41s -> 2059.29s]  My opportunity.
[2059.29s -> 2059.93s]  Wait, what?
[2061.05s -> 2062.81s]  Use of friendly fire.
[2062.81s -> 2069.14s]  This game got a full letter grade lowered.
[2069.14s -> 2070.18s]  How do I use the brick?
[2075.59s -> 2078.86s]  I'm a child.
[2078.86s -> 2080.14s]  You can craft options.
[2080.14s -> 2082.22s]  Lock it in friendly fire off.
[2082.22s -> 2083.74s]  Hey, go turn friendly fire off.
[2085.27s -> 2086.07s]  How are we going to do?
[2086.07s -> 2087.51s]  How are we going to do any like funny jokes?
[2087.51s -> 2088.01s]  It's done.
[2093.21s -> 2093.93s]  Was this it?
[2094.65s -> 2095.85s]  I think we just have to.
[2095.85s -> 2097.13s]  I think that was securing the building.
[2097.13s -> 2097.77s]  What we just did.
[2097.77s -> 2100.09s]  Parts for Carlos and his groundbreaking fence.
[2100.81s -> 2102.60s]  Hope he's still waiting at the bazaar.
[2102.60s -> 2104.52s]  Oh, I had the bottle in my hand.
[2104.52s -> 2105.32s]  Hayden.
[2105.32s -> 2106.52s]  How's it been, kid?
[2106.52s -> 2106.84s]  We're good.
[2106.84s -> 2108.20s]  The taste for city life.
[2108.20s -> 2109.32s]  I've been here and there.
[2110.28s -> 2112.52s]  You know, the best part is always happening in the center.
[2113.08s -> 2114.04s]  And that's where we're going.
[2114.04s -> 2114.60s]  I think we just leave.
[2114.60s -> 2116.68s]  Yeah, because we secured the building.
[2116.68s -> 2117.96s]  I'll tell you everything on the spot.
[2118.60s -> 2121.24s]  Meet me on the roof near the main metro station.
[2122.20s -> 2123.00s]  There's a time limit.
[2123.00s -> 2124.92s]  Yeah, we only have three more minutes to leave the building.
[2131.78s -> 2133.32s]  No help.
[2133.32s -> 2133.88s]  Oh, shit.
[2134.68s -> 2138.01s]  Don't skip this.
[2138.01s -> 2139.21s]  I feel like something interesting is going to happen.
[2141.62s -> 2142.50s]  I thought we were leaving.
[2143.06s -> 2144.38s]  Oh, OK.
[2144.38s -> 2144.94s]  You're safe.
[2145.74s -> 2148.14s]  Now, what's the story with the water?
[2148.14s -> 2148.30s]  Yeah.
[2148.30s -> 2149.58s]  Who did we stop from drinking?
[2151.11s -> 2151.75s]  I don't know him.
[2159.24s -> 2159.64s]  OK.
[2159.64s -> 2160.68s]  My head just hurt from that.
[2160.68s -> 2162.12s]  I thought that that was something wrong with the game.
[2162.12s -> 2164.36s]  Got to be a fucking criminal.
[2164.36s -> 2166.52s]  Or pretty damn fucked up to drag your ass
[2166.52s -> 2167.96s]  a hundreds of miles through a world of violence.
[2167.96s -> 2170.44s]  I feel like you're pressing right arrow key on a YouTube video.
[2170.44s -> 2172.50s]  Fucked up in a good way, of course.
[2172.50s -> 2174.02s]  So what about the water?
[2174.74s -> 2177.08s]  There ain't nothing wrong with my water.
[2177.08s -> 2178.36s]  The man at the bazaar was poisoned.
[2179.00s -> 2180.20s]  You'll be blamed if he dies.
[2181.56s -> 2181.88s]  All right.
[2182.84s -> 2183.48s]  Dammit.
[2183.48s -> 2183.88s]  OK.
[2184.76s -> 2185.80s]  It was an accident.
[2186.44s -> 2186.94s]  OK?
[2187.48s -> 2188.28s]  An accident.
[2189.16s -> 2191.08s]  It's because of these goddamn thieves.
[2191.72s -> 2192.22s]  Right.
[2192.92s -> 2194.52s]  They're always stealing my water.
[2194.52s -> 2195.08s]  Where is he?
[2195.08s -> 2196.12s]  I can't take it anymore.
[2196.68s -> 2197.24s]  So hold on.
[2197.24s -> 2198.60s]  I decided to set the trap.
[2198.60s -> 2199.24s]  Hold on.
[2199.24s -> 2200.04s]  Dude, you do.
[2202.44s -> 2204.31s]  I'll tell him the truth.
[2204.31s -> 2204.79s]  I won't.
[2206.15s -> 2207.03s]  I won't.
[2207.03s -> 2207.99s]  Wait, is he mad at us?
[2208.63s -> 2209.03s]  Yeah.
[2209.03s -> 2209.53s]  Wait.
[2210.47s -> 2211.27s]  What happened?
[2211.27s -> 2213.03s]  We missed really important context.
[2215.61s -> 2217.69s]  Dude, even if your stamina goes to zero, don't stop.
[2217.69s -> 2218.97s]  Don't stop left clicking.
[2218.97s -> 2219.61s]  Double team him.
[2220.98s -> 2222.42s]  With zero stamina, it doesn't matter.
[2222.42s -> 2223.62s]  Don't fucking stop left clicking.
[2224.42s -> 2229.21s]  I have no weapon.
[2230.57s -> 2231.21s]  So punch him.
[2242.52s -> 2243.80s]  I'm swinging at him.
[2245.53s -> 2246.89s]  But now his head comes off.
[2249.37s -> 2250.49s]  He had flour on him.
[2251.13s -> 2252.41s]  I knew he was up to something.
[2255.72s -> 2257.64s]  We killed this guy for a bag of flour.
[2258.36s -> 2261.16s]  He's baking cookies with poisoned water.
[2261.16s -> 2262.47s]  Didn't even use milk.
[2264.76s -> 2265.80s]  This is going to be a fun game.
[2267.00s -> 2270.15s]  OK.
[2270.15s -> 2271.59s]  So I mean, do we own this place now?
[2273.83s -> 2275.03s]  The world is ours for the taking.
[2275.03s -> 2275.91s]  15% off.
[2277.46s -> 2278.66s]  Oh, never mind.
[2278.66s -> 2279.46s]  I was like, what is this?
[2280.87s -> 2281.37s]  Catch.
[2285.69s -> 2287.13s]  You threw that from your ankle.
[2288.57s -> 2289.85s]  You underhanded that to me.
[2298.18s -> 2300.18s]  Night has fallen and your immunity will go down.
[2301.38s -> 2302.10s]  Oh, that's right.
[2302.10s -> 2303.46s]  We have to go into the light.
[2303.46s -> 2304.26s]  We have to be careful.
[2304.26s -> 2305.06s]  Otherwise, we turn.
[2311.56s -> 2312.68s]  We can leave the room now.
[2312.68s -> 2313.32s]  I think.
[2313.32s -> 2313.72s]  Well, yeah.
[2313.72s -> 2315.24s]  Can we wait for night to...
[2316.04s -> 2317.27s]  Do we sleep?
[2317.27s -> 2318.23s]  Maybe we should sleep.
[2318.23s -> 2318.73s]  Yeah.
[2318.95s -> 2321.27s]  Is there a bed down here?
[2321.27s -> 2322.07s]  Or should we go up to...
[2323.35s -> 2324.07s]  Yeah.
[2324.07s -> 2326.92s]  Oh, that's really important.
[2326.92s -> 2327.96s]  Yes, we're infected.
[2327.96s -> 2329.96s]  And we are slowly turning throughout the course of the game.
[2330.36s -> 2332.76s]  That was something you missed in the first, like, 10 minute cutscene.
[2332.76s -> 2333.40s]  Sorry about that.
[2334.20s -> 2337.80s]  I feel like if there was a bed, there would be one down there.
[2338.60s -> 2340.04s]  You have to craft the...
[2340.60s -> 2342.36s]  You guys are making things up.
[2342.36s -> 2342.76s]  They make...
[2342.76s -> 2343.40s]  Wait, what are they saying?
[2345.56s -> 2346.20s]  What is...
[2346.20s -> 2347.40s]  I got hurt, but...
[2347.40s -> 2352.12s]  It's all imaginary.
[2352.12s -> 2353.24s]  Yeah, there's nothing up here.
[2353.24s -> 2353.88s]  There's no bed?
[2354.68s -> 2358.33s]  I thought there was a bed.
[2358.33s -> 2359.45s]  Usually there's like the...
[2359.45s -> 2360.57s]  Yeah, it's right here, right?
[2360.57s -> 2361.07s]  No?
[2361.53s -> 2371.13s]  I mean, we can leave, but we have to be really careful.
[2371.13s -> 2371.45s]  OK.
[2371.45s -> 2372.17s]  I mean, let's go.
[2373.38s -> 2374.66s]  I swear to God there was a bed here.
[2377.96s -> 2378.84s]  You don't want to be on the ground.
[2378.84s -> 2380.73s]  I mean it.
[2380.73s -> 2382.41s]  During nighttime, you actually don't want to be on the ground.
[2382.41s -> 2383.61s]  That was in the tutorial.
[2388.57s -> 2389.05s]  What did I get?
[2390.44s -> 2391.16s]  I got something.
[2391.16s -> 2392.52s]  He's not in the same room, though.
[2392.52s -> 2393.40s]  So I can't do it.
[2393.96s -> 2394.44s]  What are you doing?
[2395.32s -> 2397.32s]  I went back downstairs to go through the door.
[2397.32s -> 2398.92s]  Why did I just get sucked over here?
[2398.92s -> 2399.96s]  Oh, because I sucked you.
[2400.76s -> 2401.69s]  I'm in control.
[2401.69s -> 2402.65s]  We're not supposed to be on the floor.
[2402.65s -> 2403.53s]  This is my game.
[2403.53s -> 2404.41s]  Let's go on the floor.
[2404.97s -> 2405.85s]  We're not supposed to be on the floor.
[2405.85s -> 2406.25s]  Climb.
[2406.25s -> 2406.97s]  You gotta climb.
[2406.97s -> 2408.33s]  Right on the street side.
[2408.33s -> 2409.37s]  That's very impressive.
[2412.25s -> 2413.21s]  Watch out, we got Zeds.
[2413.85s -> 2415.93s]  Wait, somebody's yelling.
[2417.58s -> 2418.70s]  Yeah, the zombies.
[2418.70s -> 2418.94s]  No, no, no.
[2418.94s -> 2419.82s]  There's a guy in that building.
[2420.38s -> 2421.10s]  Somebody right there.
[2421.66s -> 2422.54s]  66 meters away.
[2422.54s -> 2422.94s]  Let's do it.
[2425.34s -> 2427.66s]  Isn't it kind of rude to look in someone else's windows?
[2429.14s -> 2430.42s]  This is like an office building.
[2432.15s -> 2433.19s]  Yeah, it's still kind of weird.
[2433.19s -> 2433.51s]  Right here.
[2434.52s -> 2434.92s]  Do you see him?
[2434.92s -> 2435.72s]  You need binoculars, though.
[2435.72s -> 2436.28s]  What is it?
[2436.84s -> 2437.48s]  Where?
[2437.48s -> 2439.72s]  Somebody's hurt on that roof.
[2439.72s -> 2440.36s]  Oh, he's hurt.
[2440.36s -> 2440.76s]  He's hurt.
[2440.76s -> 2441.24s]  Let's go help him.
[2444.09s -> 2445.85s]  Over here.
[2445.85s -> 2446.73s]  I'm going the other way.
[2448.66s -> 2451.06s]  Oh, there's a special infected over here.
[2451.06s -> 2451.62s]  No, don't go that way.
[2451.62s -> 2452.02s]  Go this way.
[2455.40s -> 2455.72s]  Watch out.
[2455.72s -> 2456.36s]  We got biters.
[2461.67s -> 2462.23s]  Oh, my God.
[2462.23s -> 2462.71s]  It moves.
[2463.91s -> 2464.79s]  Careful, careful, careful.
[2467.53s -> 2468.33s]  All right.
[2468.33s -> 2468.89s]  What are we going to do?
[2469.85s -> 2470.97s]  Immunity booster.
[2470.97s -> 2472.25s]  Or a shroom booster.
[2472.25s -> 2472.97s]  Or a shroom.
[2475.64s -> 2476.28s]  I think I have shrooms.
[2476.28s -> 2476.92s]  Do you have shrooms?
[2480.54s -> 2481.18s]  Oh, nice.
[2481.82s -> 2482.86s]  Do we get a point for that?
[2485.91s -> 2486.55s]  You idiot.
[2488.95s -> 2490.63s]  We already got the experience.
[2492.94s -> 2497.74s]  Okay, I'm going to put a point.
[2497.74s -> 2499.10s]  Okay, I got a parkour.
[2499.10s -> 2500.70s]  What are you going to put your parkour point in?
[2502.38s -> 2504.22s]  I'm going to put my parkour point into.
[2506.42s -> 2509.93s]  I like firm grip.
[2509.93s -> 2512.41s]  Actually, no, I'm getting a firm grip first.
[2512.41s -> 2513.37s]  Well, I don't have a point.
[2514.10s -> 2515.30s]  You don't?
[2515.30s -> 2516.10s]  No, I didn't get one.
[2516.66s -> 2518.58s]  I probably ran through too much of the tutorial.
[2519.38s -> 2520.66s]  Oh, easy.
[2521.83s -> 2522.47s]  Easy with that.
[2523.03s -> 2527.37s]  I'm just holding on to it for, you know, we get some zeds following us.
[2527.37s -> 2527.69s]  Okay.
[2528.33s -> 2531.05s]  Some zombies, some biters, some walkers, some crawlers.
[2531.05s -> 2533.93s]  I think we're going to turn in like three minutes.
[2533.93s -> 2535.42s]  What are we going to do?
[2535.42s -> 2535.74s]  I don't know.
[2535.74s -> 2537.26s]  We have to find a safe house.
[2537.26s -> 2538.38s]  Oh, this way.
[2538.38s -> 2539.90s]  Yeah, number one.
[2539.90s -> 2540.94s]  We have to go to number one.
[2540.94s -> 2542.90s]  Okay, let's go number one.
[2545.13s -> 2545.85s]  Oh, my God.
[2545.85s -> 2546.49s]  I fucked it up.
[2547.21s -> 2547.61s]  I'm fine.
[2548.17s -> 2551.62s]  Are you trying to throw that at me?
[2551.62s -> 2552.82s]  I couldn't jump with it.
[2552.82s -> 2557.42s]  Oh, now I got a parkour skill point.
[2557.42s -> 2558.86s]  Now I'm a firm gripper.
[2558.86s -> 2559.90s]  I just I don't want to.
[2559.90s -> 2561.66s]  I really don't want to like alarm you or anything,
[2561.66s -> 2563.74s]  but we really only have, I think, three minutes before we die.
[2564.30s -> 2565.51s]  Wait, question mark.
[2566.15s -> 2568.97s]  Somebody screaming down there.
[2569.91s -> 2571.19s]  Downstairs, we're going to go.
[2571.19s -> 2574.81s]  Ow.
[2575.51s -> 2577.48s]  Where'd you go?
[2577.48s -> 2577.98s]  I went down.
[2578.94s -> 2580.94s]  The other side of the building.
[2580.94s -> 2581.42s]  It's down.
[2581.42s -> 2583.10s]  Whatever it is, it's down like in the building.
[2588.31s -> 2589.35s]  Your immunity is low.
[2589.35s -> 2590.47s]  Use shrooms.
[2590.47s -> 2591.45s]  Oh, shit.
[2593.82s -> 2594.14s]  Oh, yeah.
[2594.14s -> 2594.94s]  We get over there room.
[2595.58s -> 2596.30s]  How do you shroom?
[2597.86s -> 2599.46s]  Mine's on my heel button.
[2599.46s -> 2602.34s]  How do we get in there?
[2609.94s -> 2612.18s]  We can see there's UV light in that direction.
[2612.18s -> 2614.02s]  We can go there is we can't get in there.
[2614.02s -> 2614.34s]  All right.
[2614.34s -> 2615.78s]  We have to actually get back up top.
[2615.78s -> 2617.62s]  We're going to get killed as a screamer.
[2617.62s -> 2617.86s]  Don't.
[2617.86s -> 2618.26s]  Oh, my God.
[2618.26s -> 2618.98s]  You're going to get us killed.
[2620.58s -> 2621.86s]  Don't alert the screamer.
[2621.86s -> 2623.22s]  I've been such a bitch.
[2623.22s -> 2626.04s]  It's tough.
[2626.68s -> 2631.24s]  I don't know where to go from here.
[2633.11s -> 2633.99s]  What did you do?
[2633.99s -> 2636.79s]  I jumped on the air conditioner.
[2636.79s -> 2637.03s]  OK.
[2637.03s -> 2637.91s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2637.91s -> 2638.39s]  Gas can.
[2639.11s -> 2639.59s]  Let's go.
[2640.95s -> 2642.23s]  180 meters.
[2642.23s -> 2643.19s]  Immunity is low.
[2646.38s -> 2647.90s]  What is shrooms on like the mini bar?
[2648.71s -> 2649.35s]  Mine is H.
[2650.95s -> 2651.83s]  I have no healing.
[2652.47s -> 2656.06s]  Oh, shit.
[2656.06s -> 2657.66s]  There's an inhibitor container nearby.
[2657.66s -> 2658.70s]  We're critical right now.
[2658.70s -> 2659.98s]  We're absolutely critical.
[2659.98s -> 2668.20s]  Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[2669.00s -> 2670.12s]  Why can't I grab this?
[2672.20s -> 2672.84s]  This is bad.
[2674.04s -> 2675.16s]  It changed my marker.
[2675.80s -> 2676.44s]  We have to go.
[2676.44s -> 2679.00s]  We have 49 seconds to touch this UV thing over here.
[2680.58s -> 2680.98s]  This way.
[2680.98s -> 2681.38s]  Follow me.
[2686.98s -> 2687.94s]  Oh, my God.
[2688.74s -> 2691.66s]  You're falling behind, kid.
[2693.02s -> 2695.30s]  Hey, I'm dead.
[2700.10s -> 2700.66s]  Did you make it?
[2701.22s -> 2701.46s]  Yeah.
[2702.34s -> 2703.06s]  Can you come help me?
[2706.15s -> 2707.67s]  I'm going to have lunch with these guys.
[2708.47s -> 2709.37s]  I'm dead.
[2710.17s -> 2713.35s]  What happens?
[2713.35s -> 2714.55s]  Are you actually dead?
[2714.55s -> 2714.95s]  Yeah.
[2714.95s -> 2718.49s]  I'm going to respawn.
[2719.43s -> 2719.83s]  I could.
[2719.83s -> 2722.55s]  It gives me the option to teleport you to me still.
[2722.55s -> 2724.98s]  Oh, can you do that?
[2726.42s -> 2727.86s]  Wait, actually, don't do that.
[2728.58s -> 2729.14s]  You're here.
[2729.14s -> 2729.54s]  I'm here.
[2731.90s -> 2732.46s]  Oh, OK.
[2732.46s -> 2732.70s]  Cool.
[2733.50s -> 2736.06s]  I don't know how to switch to my healing item.
[2736.06s -> 2737.66s]  It's still on shrooms for me.
[2737.66s -> 2739.16s]  All right.
[2739.16s -> 2743.58s]  We should probably make some weapons.
[2743.58s -> 2744.38s]  UV bar.
[2744.38s -> 2746.94s]  Oh, that's kind of cool.
[2746.94s -> 2748.66s]  Two.
[2748.66s -> 2749.78s]  Ah, hold two.
[2751.11s -> 2752.95s]  So I don't have any money.
[2753.85s -> 2754.97s]  Hold two.
[2755.61s -> 2758.09s]  Grade, scissors, craft parts.
[2758.09s -> 2758.49s]  All right.
[2758.49s -> 2759.29s]  I should.
[2759.29s -> 2763.38s]  Weapon mods, goods, fire arrows.
[2763.38s -> 2769.86s]  I wonder weapon mod grip.
[2769.86s -> 2771.70s]  Come back and I'll top you off real good.
[2772.26s -> 2773.93s]  I don't know what I should sell.
[2774.49s -> 2776.39s]  What's going on here?
[2776.39s -> 2776.87s]  Hello.
[2776.87s -> 2777.67s]  I'm Henkel.
[2778.31s -> 2781.43s]  This student here was curious about my lesson today.
[2781.43s -> 2782.55s]  It's a noisy chair.
[2782.55s -> 2784.95s]  Not when the guns were confiscated in villages.
[2784.95s -> 2785.51s]  You hear all that?
[2785.51s -> 2786.39s]  He wants.
[2787.35s -> 2788.23s]  Yeah, I'm in a cut scene.
[2788.23s -> 2788.79s]  Are you?
[2788.79s -> 2789.91s]  Yeah.
[2789.91s -> 2791.43s]  Oh, well.
[2791.43s -> 2792.55s]  No one touch it.
[2793.67s -> 2794.79s]  Henkel's got a problem.
[2795.67s -> 2797.05s]  History lesson, side quest.
[2797.61s -> 2798.49s]  Hold T to track.
[2798.49s -> 2799.05s]  I'm tracking it.
[2799.05s -> 2799.77s]  We're doing it.
[2799.77s -> 2800.57s]  He's important.
[2800.57s -> 2801.37s]  Reach the memorial.
[2801.37s -> 2801.93s]  Oh, hey.
[2801.93s -> 2802.81s]  OK, dude, it's two.
[2803.85s -> 2804.73s]  Yeah, hold two.
[2804.73s -> 2806.97s]  It's two to cycle through things on your minimap.
[2806.97s -> 2807.61s]  Yeah, really?
[2808.41s -> 2809.37s]  Are you serious?
[2809.37s -> 2810.98s]  Well, you already knew that?
[2813.29s -> 2814.01s]  This isn't a bit.
[2822.26s -> 2822.90s]  Accessories.
[2824.10s -> 2826.98s]  Make sure you have lock picks and stuff, man.
[2826.98s -> 2828.34s]  I mean, I'm geared.
[2828.34s -> 2829.38s]  I'm in the UV light.
[2830.26s -> 2831.54s]  OK, inventory.
[2831.54s -> 2834.44s]  Decoy, Molotov, throwing knives.
[2834.44s -> 2834.68s]  All right.
[2834.68s -> 2836.04s]  I have UV shrooms now.
[2836.04s -> 2838.49s]  Can you craft UV shrooms?
[2838.49s -> 2840.09s]  Oh, no.
[2840.09s -> 2844.07s]  OK.
[2844.07s -> 2844.95s]  How do you cycle through?
[2844.95s -> 2845.43s]  There we go.
[2846.07s -> 2847.99s]  I got my Molotovs.
[2847.99s -> 2848.79s]  Three, I'm assuming is.
[2848.79s -> 2849.67s]  How do you cycle weapon?
[2850.73s -> 2855.82s]  One, two, three, four.
[2855.82s -> 2857.90s]  You just completely tuned him out like it was your job.
[2858.62s -> 2861.69s]  It's still nighttime, though.
[2861.69s -> 2862.41s]  We have to go sleep.
[2863.22s -> 2865.51s]  I think I don't care.
[2865.51s -> 2867.35s]  Like, I'm a challenge.
[2867.35s -> 2868.71s]  Like, I want to move in stealth.
[2868.71s -> 2869.67s]  You know what I'm saying?
[2869.67s -> 2870.47s]  Like, the moon's out.
[2870.47s -> 2871.27s]  We can still see.
[2872.78s -> 2873.82s]  You remember in dying light?
[2873.82s -> 2876.46s]  Actually, it was so dark you couldn't see like more than a foot.
[2877.34s -> 2879.98s]  Let's pull your binoculars and start marking shit.
[2879.98s -> 2880.54s]  OK, there we go.
[2880.54s -> 2881.90s]  Discover the old lumber mill.
[2885.53s -> 2887.29s]  You definitely cannot see through those.
[2887.29s -> 2888.65s]  Those are way too wide for your head.
[2889.77s -> 2890.95s]  What do we got up here?
[2891.83s -> 2892.97s]  Look for things to mark.
[2894.84s -> 2895.88s]  I have them all already.
[2895.88s -> 2897.40s]  I always went out there.
[2897.40s -> 2897.64s]  Yep.
[2897.64s -> 2899.48s]  See?
[2899.48s -> 2900.20s]  All right.
[2900.20s -> 2902.28s]  So I think we just have to choose which way we're going to go.
[2903.00s -> 2906.20s]  Well, no, I'm doing the Reach the Memorial Squared mission
[2906.20s -> 2907.88s]  that this guy just gave us.
[2907.88s -> 2908.44s]  OK.
[2908.44s -> 2910.76s]  Are you ready?
[2910.76s -> 2911.16s]  Yeah.
[2911.72s -> 2913.90s]  Let's move.
[2913.90s -> 2914.46s]  Yeah.
[2914.46s -> 2918.06s]  You're all crafted up.
[2918.06s -> 2918.62s]  All right.
[2918.62s -> 2919.90s]  You think you can make this jump powder?
[2923.96s -> 2925.32s]  I did, but for some reason I felt...
[2926.04s -> 2926.60s]  Excuse me?
[2927.56s -> 2929.24s]  That's classic power.
[2929.24s -> 2929.56s]  No, no, no.
[2929.56s -> 2931.08s]  But like, honestly, excuse me.
[2931.08s -> 2932.04s]  What happened?
[2932.04s -> 2934.26s]  Why did I die?
[2934.26s -> 2935.30s]  What happened to me?
[2935.30s -> 2936.62s]  I got you.
[2936.62s -> 2937.10s]  It's fine.
[2937.74s -> 2939.34s]  You're not fast like the others.
[2939.34s -> 2941.45s]  There's a zombie right behind you.
[2941.45s -> 2943.05s]  Why did I delay my death?
[2943.05s -> 2943.69s]  That was weird.
[2946.18s -> 2946.58s]  What the...
[2948.90s -> 2949.54s]  Weird's going on.
[2949.54s -> 2950.50s]  I'm telling you.
[2950.50s -> 2951.62s]  I tried to climb up and I couldn't.
[2957.45s -> 2958.97s]  OK, are we climbing back up?
[2958.97s -> 2959.85s]  Let's climb back up.
[2959.85s -> 2960.09s]  Yeah.
[2963.03s -> 2968.47s]  I can't stand on this guy.
[2968.47s -> 2968.95s]  Come on.
[2972.17s -> 2973.29s]  OK, from here we can go this way.
[2973.29s -> 2973.45s]  Yep.
[2974.41s -> 2978.73s]  Are we going to...
[2978.73s -> 2979.85s]  We got a little hovel here.
[2980.49s -> 2982.12s]  I wonder what's inside.
[2984.42s -> 2985.30s]  Do you want to explore it?
[2985.94s -> 2986.34s]  Yeah.
[2986.34s -> 2987.30s]  I'm looking to explore it.
[2987.30s -> 2988.34s]  Let's go.
[2988.34s -> 2991.48s]  It looks like we're both having the same problem
[2991.48s -> 2992.52s]  of how do you just go down.
[2993.56s -> 2996.76s]  The whole tutorial, I was like, what button lets go?
[2997.48s -> 3000.25s]  Use your gamma resets.
[3000.89s -> 3002.33s]  This is one of those pre-war buildings
[3002.33s -> 3003.77s]  with four floors and no rooms.
[3004.41s -> 3007.99s]  Nothing down here.
[3012.28s -> 3014.28s]  Run to the ground floor again.
[3014.28s -> 3014.84s]  Oh, wait.
[3014.84s -> 3015.40s]  I can open this.
[3018.79s -> 3019.43s]  Oh, yeah.
[3019.43s -> 3020.47s]  We get guns in the police car.
[3020.47s -> 3020.71s]  All right.
[3020.71s -> 3021.83s]  I got your back.
[3021.83s -> 3022.63s]  A couple of heads coming.
[3024.39s -> 3024.95s]  Watch my back.
[3027.34s -> 3027.90s]  Oh, dude.
[3028.38s -> 3030.46s]  ASUS Republic of Gamers.
[3030.46s -> 3031.10s]  What?
[3031.10s -> 3037.32s]  There's a hallow over here.
[3042.92s -> 3043.32s]  Up here.
[3051.38s -> 3052.10s]  Why did my...
[3052.10s -> 3052.34s]  OK.
[3053.58s -> 3055.90s]  Why did my stamina just drop to zero?
[3056.54s -> 3057.34s]  What did I do wrong?
[3057.34s -> 3057.82s]  What happened?
[3059.21s -> 3060.65s]  My stamina bar was at like 60 percent
[3060.65s -> 3061.53s]  and it just went to zero.
[3062.09s -> 3063.59s]  Lion power.
[3064.23s -> 3065.94s]  Stop saying that.
[3067.06s -> 3067.38s]  Why?
[3068.26s -> 3070.10s]  Because I watched the show.
[3070.98s -> 3083.58s]  If you saw two episodes, it's all you need to know.
[3083.58s -> 3084.78s]  So from here, where do you want to...
[3084.78s -> 3085.18s]  This way?
[3085.90s -> 3088.46s]  Half of our UV, our life is gone.
[3088.46s -> 3088.86s]  I know.
[3088.86s -> 3090.22s]  We're not supposed to be doing what we're doing.
[3090.94s -> 3091.86s]  OK.
[3092.58s -> 3094.90s]  We're supposed to have been sleeping.
[3094.90s -> 3096.66s]  This is where we started.
[3096.66s -> 3096.98s]  What?
[3098.26s -> 3099.06s]  No, it is not.
[3100.58s -> 3101.46s]  No, it's not.
[3101.46s -> 3101.78s]  What?
[3101.78s -> 3102.34s]  No way.
[3102.98s -> 3103.54s]  No way.
[3105.18s -> 3106.06s]  This is impossible.
[3106.86s -> 3107.98s]  It's impossible.
[3107.98s -> 3109.26s]  How is it impossible?
[3109.26s -> 3110.14s]  They don't have a bed.
[3110.14s -> 3110.62s]  Where can we...
[3110.62s -> 3111.66s]  How do we skip time?
[3115.11s -> 3116.63s]  I can't believe it.
[3116.63s -> 3117.75s]  I can't believe it, man.
[3117.75s -> 3118.31s]  I really can't.
[3119.54s -> 3120.50s]  How did we do that?
[3121.06s -> 3123.54s]  OK.
[3125.29s -> 3126.33s]  We need to find...
[3126.33s -> 3126.65s]  OK.
[3128.12s -> 3129.56s]  I'm taking the reins.
[3129.56s -> 3130.04s]  All right.
[3130.04s -> 3130.60s]  You're my leader.
[3130.60s -> 3131.48s]  What do I do?
[3131.48s -> 3134.20s]  Mark on your map the bed over here.
[3134.20s -> 3137.45s]  The bed over here.
[3138.09s -> 3140.57s]  The green bed that's over here in the middle.
[3140.57s -> 3141.13s]  If you hit...
[3141.13s -> 3142.98s]  Go to your map.
[3142.98s -> 3144.33s]  Mark this.
[3144.33s -> 3145.13s]  The green bed.
[3145.69s -> 3147.13s]  No, we're going to do the history lesson.
[3147.13s -> 3147.45s]  Shut up.
[3147.45s -> 3147.85s]  I'm going.
[3147.85s -> 3148.57s]  I'm taking the reins.
[3148.57s -> 3149.05s]  We're not...
[3149.05s -> 3149.53s]  I'm telling you.
[3149.53s -> 3153.21s]  The game has told us over and over again not to play the game when it's nighttime.
[3153.21s -> 3154.57s]  I'm taking the reins right now.
[3164.02s -> 3164.66s]  Can you keep up?
[3165.22s -> 3166.07s]  I think so.
[3166.63s -> 3168.66s]  I'll look at this.
[3169.38s -> 3171.27s]  We actually can open this, can we?
[3172.15s -> 3172.39s]  No.
[3172.95s -> 3173.19s]  What?
[3174.92s -> 3176.20s]  Bait quest box.
[3176.20s -> 3176.84s]  You see down there?
[3176.84s -> 3177.56s]  Do you see the marker?
[3178.52s -> 3180.90s]  That's where we're going.
[3180.90s -> 3182.50s]  Don't play this game at 3 a.m.
[3185.78s -> 3186.66s]  No, don't.
[3186.66s -> 3189.03s]  That's not something we can mark.
[3189.03s -> 3190.92s]  There's a lot of zombies down there.
[3191.72s -> 3192.76s]  Oh, what's the plan?
[3192.76s -> 3193.56s]  Electrical station.
[3194.20s -> 3195.62s]  All right, the plan is we're going to go...
[3198.41s -> 3199.37s]  Well, we have to go that way.
[3199.37s -> 3200.25s]  So should we jump on the X?
[3201.82s -> 3202.46s]  Yeah.
[3202.46s -> 3203.26s]  All right, you go first.
[3204.62s -> 3205.50s]  All right.
[3205.50s -> 3206.78s]  I'm going to show you how a pro does it.
[3207.42s -> 3212.84s]  I went way too far.
[3212.84s -> 3213.24s]  I'm fine.
[3215.59s -> 3216.31s]  That's a howler.
[3216.31s -> 3217.03s]  We got to go.
[3217.03s -> 3217.91s]  We do actually have to go.
[3219.98s -> 3220.62s]  Come on, powder.
[3226.39s -> 3228.68s]  You got this.
[3228.68s -> 3229.72s]  You're going to keep doing that.
[3242.18s -> 3243.38s]  We got UV light and everything.
[3243.38s -> 3243.94s]  There's a howler now.
[3243.94s -> 3244.58s]  And there's a howler.
[3246.20s -> 3247.24s]  Take out your sniper rifle.
[3247.24s -> 3248.28s]  Take the shot.
[3248.28s -> 3248.44s]  All right.
[3248.44s -> 3250.12s]  How do I throw a device?
[3251.24s -> 3252.76s]  You got to find something to throw.
[3252.76s -> 3253.40s]  I'm pretty sure.
[3253.40s -> 3254.28s]  I mean, OK.
[3255.16s -> 3256.62s]  Anybody screaming?
[3257.26s -> 3258.47s]  Oh, shit.
[3258.47s -> 3259.03s]  We got Zeds.
[3259.67s -> 3260.79s]  Somebody actually just screamed.
[3260.79s -> 3264.71s]  Help me, Marina.
[3264.71s -> 3269.21s]  Did you ever play Mission Makers for N64?
[3270.17s -> 3270.41s]  What?
[3271.61s -> 3272.33s]  Mission Makers?
[3272.33s -> 3274.09s]  No, I have not.
[3274.09s -> 3277.54s]  It's very good.
[3277.54s -> 3277.78s]  All right.
[3277.78s -> 3278.50s]  So this person is...
[3281.45s -> 3282.09s]  They're on the roof.
[3282.09s -> 3282.57s]  Oh, you're here.
[3283.05s -> 3283.45s]  OK.
[3283.45s -> 3284.97s]  You're trying to help the person.
[3284.97s -> 3286.97s]  I mean, we might as well do missions and shit.
[3286.97s -> 3288.89s]  There's two howlers down here, dude.
[3288.89s -> 3289.69s]  Just walk by them.
[3291.75s -> 3292.47s]  Get up here, Omar.
[3296.90s -> 3297.30s]  X.
[3297.30s -> 3297.86s]  Press X.
[3298.98s -> 3300.79s]  How do you blow that up?
[3300.79s -> 3301.27s]  Oh, shit.
[3301.27s -> 3301.51s]  Go.
[3302.23s -> 3303.19s]  You had to press X.
[3307.56s -> 3308.04s]  Oh, no.
[3311.11s -> 3312.07s]  I'm going to die again, dude.
[3312.07s -> 3312.55s]  I'm not kidding.
[3319.37s -> 3320.97s]  Survivor has turned.
[3320.97s -> 3321.69s]  Did you turn?
[3322.65s -> 3322.89s]  No.
[3324.17s -> 3324.97s]  Did I?
[3324.97s -> 3325.37s]  No.
[3325.37s -> 3326.17s]  That must be you.
[3326.97s -> 3327.61s]  It's not me.
[3328.25s -> 3328.97s]  It's not me.
[3328.97s -> 3330.73s]  Oh, the person we were trying to save, maybe?
[3330.73s -> 3331.21s]  Oh, OK.
[3332.09s -> 3332.97s]  Come on, powder.
[3332.97s -> 3334.01s]  Silko's goons are coming.
[3335.82s -> 3337.10s]  Stop saying that.
[3337.98s -> 3340.71s]  Stay on mission.
[3340.71s -> 3341.59s]  Down here, we got a question mark.
[3341.59s -> 3343.59s]  No, I didn't want to grab this brick building.
[3344.47s -> 3346.28s]  Come on.
[3346.28s -> 3347.40s]  To the UV light up here.
[3350.73s -> 3350.97s]  Oh.
[3353.18s -> 3353.74s]  Zed's on me.
[3353.74s -> 3354.62s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[3354.62s -> 3355.18s]  Zed's on me.
[3356.47s -> 3356.95s]  Oh, no.
[3357.99s -> 3358.55s]  Go to the light.
[3358.55s -> 3359.51s]  I'm at the monument.
[3359.51s -> 3359.91s]  At the light?
[3359.91s -> 3360.39s]  You were right.
[3363.43s -> 3364.07s]  Breathe it in, quick.
[3364.71s -> 3364.95s]  OK.
[3365.83s -> 3368.78s]  There is much more to it.
[3368.78s -> 3369.50s]  You're getting burned.
[3371.10s -> 3372.06s]  They can't take the heat.
[3372.78s -> 3374.30s]  And they shouldn't stand in the fire.
[3374.30s -> 3374.62s]  Nice.
[3374.62s -> 3375.26s]  OK, we got it.
[3375.74s -> 3376.54s]  Objective updated.
[3380.47s -> 3381.43s]  Investigate the square.
[3382.39s -> 3384.18s]  Use your game revision.
[3384.18s -> 3385.86s]  So yeah, we have to investigate this area here?
[3386.42s -> 3388.50s]  All players required to investigate this plaque.
[3388.50s -> 3389.86s]  That's kind of going to get annoying.
[3391.06s -> 3393.91s]  What did that say?
[3393.91s -> 3394.55s]  Something detected?
[3394.55s -> 3395.43s]  There's a plaque here.
[3395.99s -> 3397.72s]  A lot of names on it.
[3397.72s -> 3398.36s]  People died.
[3398.36s -> 3398.60s]  Yeah.
[3399.24s -> 3403.43s]  Don't say this game sucks, bro.
[3403.43s -> 3404.07s]  No, it doesn't.
[3404.79s -> 3405.75s]  I'm really enjoying it.
[3405.75s -> 3406.63s]  It actually is pretty good.
[3407.43s -> 3410.23s]  I think the multiplayer connection is a little weird,
[3410.23s -> 3411.11s]  but that's not.
[3413.08s -> 3414.28s]  It looks OK for me.
[3414.28s -> 3415.88s]  Are you having lag issues?
[3415.88s -> 3417.80s]  It desyncs and it looks a little weird,
[3417.80s -> 3419.40s]  but it's just making it more fun, to be honest.
[3420.28s -> 3425.62s]  OK, so now investigate the square.
[3425.62s -> 3426.74s]  Is there more stuff we have to press?
[3428.09s -> 3429.05s]  Yeah, use your game revision.
[3429.05s -> 3430.09s]  OK, the thing right next to it.
[3431.29s -> 3435.10s]  This is one of those locked containers somewhere over here.
[3436.66s -> 3439.46s]  Yeah, we both need to investigate the same thing.
[3439.46s -> 3439.94s]  Yeah.
[3439.94s -> 3440.34s]  Come.
[3440.34s -> 3440.90s]  OK.
[3440.90s -> 3441.78s]  Wait, didn't we do that?
[3442.42s -> 3443.38s]  No, we didn't.
[3443.38s -> 3444.26s]  Apparently not this one.
[3445.08s -> 3447.08s]  Hold F and then press F and then press F again.
[3447.08s -> 3448.12s]  What happened here?
[3448.12s -> 3450.36s]  What happened in the last 10 years of PC games
[3450.36s -> 3451.72s]  where they changed E to F?
[3451.72s -> 3452.60s]  Have you noticed that?
[3452.60s -> 3454.68s]  They changed E to F and they made you have to hold it.
[3456.04s -> 3457.08s]  What happened there?
[3457.08s -> 3460.20s]  I'm going to blame Sean Murray and No Man's Sky
[3460.20s -> 3461.32s]  and all of his lies.
[3461.32s -> 3462.28s]  Shots were fired.
[3462.28s -> 3464.36s]  The army started shooting at people.
[3465.08s -> 3468.01s]  Is that person supposed to be in this cutscene?
[3468.01s -> 3468.65s]  We're killing him.
[3469.77s -> 3472.20s]  They are?
[3474.30s -> 3475.58s]  Light the candle.
[3477.77s -> 3479.85s]  Embrace the light, young man.
[3481.21s -> 3481.93s]  Light the candle.
[3482.89s -> 3484.65s]  I don't think this person is supposed to be in the cutscene.
[3484.65s -> 3486.49s]  I think they just accidentally got through the barrier.
[3487.13s -> 3492.15s]  All players required.
[3493.37s -> 3495.45s]  Man, imagine playing with like 16 people.
[3497.45s -> 3498.33s]  Made a bad call.
[3498.33s -> 3499.13s]  Taking people's guns.
[3502.22s -> 3503.58s]  This is actual flop.
[3503.58s -> 3505.02s]  This is not a flop.
[3505.02s -> 3506.22s]  Why are you guys saying flop?
[3506.78s -> 3516.62s]  OK, so now we got to go back to where we're going now.
[3517.90s -> 3520.14s]  What's this forsaken store in front of us?
[3520.14s -> 3520.62s]  You see that?
[3522.82s -> 3523.30s]  Yeah, I do.
[3524.34s -> 3528.34s]  With the beep beep beep the box detected, box detected.
[3528.34s -> 3529.14s]  Are you getting that over here?
[3530.02s -> 3532.02s]  No, I'm not getting a box detected.
[3532.02s -> 3533.30s]  It's like container detected.
[3533.30s -> 3538.02s]  There's one of those G, what is it?
[3538.02s -> 3538.74s]  The inhibitors?
[3539.30s -> 3541.54s]  Yeah, we can use our key on something here.
[3544.58s -> 3547.22s]  When you're close to one of those locked chests, it goes like this.
[3549.11s -> 3550.55s]  Yeah, it goes box detected.
[3552.94s -> 3553.26s]  I don't know.
[3553.26s -> 3554.22s]  I don't see anything.
[3554.22s -> 3555.42s]  I don't know where it is.
[3555.42s -> 3556.54s]  You have to use your gamer sense.
[3557.26s -> 3558.94s]  I'm gamer sensing as hard as I can.
[3558.94s -> 3560.86s]  I mean, maybe it's in the forsaken store.
[3560.86s -> 3563.98s]  It might be like if you want to go to the forsaken store.
[3563.98s -> 3564.46s]  That's right.
[3565.85s -> 3567.29s]  Bottom left icon.
[3567.29s -> 3567.93s]  Oh, shit.
[3567.93s -> 3569.37s]  OK, it tells you how close you are.
[3572.70s -> 3573.82s]  Oh, it does.
[3573.82s -> 3575.10s]  Oh, we're playing hot and cold.
[3575.66s -> 3578.14s]  Yeah, so when we walk, we walk towards the storage.
[3578.14s -> 3579.42s]  Actually, probably stealth this part.
[3584.41s -> 3587.70s]  There's one behind you.
[3588.90s -> 3590.18s]  I opened up a trunk.
[3590.18s -> 3590.90s]  You're going to attack me?
[3591.22s -> 3591.72s]  Yeah.
[3596.89s -> 3597.39s]  Didn't work.
[3603.37s -> 3604.17s]  Go back to the light.
[3605.56s -> 3606.28s]  Embrace the light.
[3607.96s -> 3608.84s]  We're going to get a redo.
[3609.56s -> 3610.06s]  Fine.
[3612.15s -> 3612.95s]  I got a decoy.
[3612.95s -> 3613.83s]  I don't know how to throw it.
[3613.83s -> 3614.63s]  How do you get a weapon?
[3615.75s -> 3616.25s]  What?
[3617.19s -> 3618.63s]  When did I have this?
[3619.51s -> 3624.26s]  I've had this the whole time.
[3624.26s -> 3624.90s]  It's always G.
[3625.70s -> 3626.34s]  It's not G.
[3630.97s -> 3631.78s]  All right.
[3631.78s -> 3632.74s]  We have to open this crate.
[3634.02s -> 3641.34s]  There's one guy here.
[3641.34s -> 3642.14s]  We don't have to worry about this.
[3642.86s -> 3645.00s]  I'm getting park work.
[3646.60s -> 3647.48s]  You're standing still?
[3648.36s -> 3649.00s]  Middle mouse.
[3649.00s -> 3649.64s]  OK, hold on.
[3649.64s -> 3650.14s]  Hold on.
[3651.08s -> 3651.96s]  I'm going to throw the thing.
[3651.96s -> 3652.44s]  You ready?
[3652.44s -> 3652.92s]  Wait, hold on.
[3652.92s -> 3653.56s]  I have a skill point.
[3654.20s -> 3655.08s]  I just stood there.
[3655.08s -> 3656.28s]  I survived the night.
[3656.28s -> 3656.78s]  Air kick.
[3659.22s -> 3660.50s]  Yeah, I'm getting an air kick.
[3660.50s -> 3661.78s]  I'm a bit of an air kicker.
[3662.58s -> 3665.02s]  We're killing them.
[3666.49s -> 3666.99s]  You missed.
[3668.17s -> 3669.29s]  Yeah, I don't want to break my weapon.
[3670.25s -> 3670.89s]  It's daytime.
[3670.89s -> 3671.85s]  See, we survived the night.
[3671.85s -> 3672.73s]  We're good.
[3672.73s -> 3673.85s]  Would you get extra EXP?
[3674.73s -> 3675.23s]  Yeah.
[3675.23s -> 3675.73s]  Cool.
[3677.07s -> 3678.27s]  OK, so let's go find the thing.
[3684.25s -> 3684.89s]  Find the thing.
[3686.09s -> 3686.59s]  What is that?
[3687.21s -> 3688.09s]  It's my noisemaker.
[3688.09s -> 3688.57s]  Find the thing.
[3688.57s -> 3688.73s]  All right.
[3688.73s -> 3689.45s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[3691.79s -> 3692.83s]  It's this way.
[3694.94s -> 3695.74s]  Container nearby.
[3697.10s -> 3697.82s]  Nine meters away.
[3697.82s -> 3699.02s]  There's so many people here.
[3699.58s -> 3701.85s]  They're not people anymore.
[3702.65s -> 3704.48s]  Where is it?
[3706.75s -> 3707.31s]  It's down that way.
[3707.31s -> 3709.39s]  It's got to be in one of these cars or something.
[3709.39s -> 3710.19s]  Get on top of this.
[3710.19s -> 3710.83s]  Yeah, it's over here.
[3711.39s -> 3712.27s]  A little bit further this way.
[3717.13s -> 3719.21s]  And then jump onto the sign.
[3719.85s -> 3723.47s]  And then we go that way.
[3724.27s -> 3731.08s]  Where are you looking for?
[3731.08s -> 3731.64s]  I'm going to die.
[3731.64s -> 3732.68s]  I'm going to die.
[3732.68s -> 3733.24s]  You're going to die?
[3734.28s -> 3734.76s]  What happened?
[3735.48s -> 3736.28s]  What are you doing?
[3737.08s -> 3738.76s]  I'm killing Zed.
[3739.64s -> 3740.28s]  What is happening?
[3740.28s -> 3741.16s]  Remember me.
[3741.16s -> 3742.36s]  What is going on over there?
[3742.92s -> 3743.56s]  Remember me.
[3744.44s -> 3746.52s]  Why do you have an infinite supply of these things?
[3749.08s -> 3749.58s]  What?
[3750.04s -> 3751.32s]  Watch out.
[3751.32s -> 3752.28s]  Somebody on the roof.
[3752.28s -> 3753.08s]  Somebody got sick of you.
[3755.55s -> 3757.31s]  It's like, who's the fuck throwing all those?
[3757.31s -> 3758.11s]  This is just...
[3758.11s -> 3759.55s]  We're making a skate video.
[3759.55s -> 3761.95s]  This is what a skate video would be like in this period here.
[3765.20s -> 3766.72s]  Are you just filming me?
[3766.72s -> 3767.84s]  All right, it's over here.
[3769.04s -> 3769.54s]  Oh, shit.
[3770.16s -> 3771.26s]  Oh, you get that, bro?
[3771.26s -> 3772.06s]  You get that on camera?
[3772.06s -> 3772.94s]  I did.
[3772.94s -> 3774.22s]  I'm uploading that to ZeeTube.
[3776.70s -> 3777.42s]  ZedTube.
[3777.98s -> 3779.10s]  All right, it's definitely...
[3779.10s -> 3781.50s]  I don't know where it is, but we keep getting closer.
[3782.38s -> 3782.88s]  Fuck you.
[3784.78s -> 3785.74s]  Where is it?
[3785.74s -> 3788.62s]  15, 13, 12, 10 meters.
[3789.42s -> 3790.54s]  I found some shrooms up here.
[3790.54s -> 3792.54s]  10, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3.
[3793.18s -> 3794.78s]  It's like on top of me somewhere right here.
[3795.50s -> 3797.36s]  Help me.
[3797.36s -> 3797.60s]  Help me.
[3797.60s -> 3798.16s]  Where's your bombs?
[3802.00s -> 3802.80s]  It's like, where is it?
[3802.80s -> 3803.76s]  It's right there somewhere.
[3804.64s -> 3805.52s]  It's got to be in the car.
[3806.24s -> 3809.72s]  Oh, it's in the subway station.
[3810.36s -> 3812.51s]  Okay, we're going under.
[3813.31s -> 3813.71s]  Let's go.
[3814.43s -> 3816.75s]  Make sure you press...
[3816.75s -> 3817.63s]  You turn on your flashlight.
[3818.67s -> 3819.61s]  Stealth, take down.
[3820.49s -> 3821.21s]  I choked him out.
[3821.77s -> 3822.57s]  We got to pick this stuff up.
[3822.57s -> 3823.53s]  I need to make some more heals.
[3824.33s -> 3826.51s]  Oh, it's right here.
[3826.51s -> 3827.55s]  Yep, nice.
[3827.55s -> 3830.72s]  So what's in it?
[3830.72s -> 3831.12s]  Anything good?
[3831.12s -> 3831.84s]  The defibrillator.
[3831.84s -> 3835.08s]  Why is that guy burning to death in the subway?
[3835.08s -> 3835.56s]  Oh, nice.
[3835.56s -> 3836.28s]  We need these things.
[3836.84s -> 3838.35s]  This thing actually...
[3838.35s -> 3839.23s]  We have to collect these.
[3840.11s -> 3844.49s]  Yeah, that's when your max stamina increases.
[3844.49s -> 3845.53s]  Hey, hold on.
[3845.53s -> 3846.41s]  Let me heal you.
[3846.41s -> 3849.37s]  We're taking a lot of damage out there.
[3849.37s -> 3849.93s]  Gas can.
[3850.57s -> 3851.53s]  Actually, we should actually...
[3851.53s -> 3853.05s]  Let me craft a little bit here.
[3853.05s -> 3854.01s]  This game is fun.
[3854.01s -> 3855.61s]  I need honey.
[3855.61s -> 3858.94s]  I can give you some honey.
[3859.95s -> 3860.67s]  Stop.
[3860.67s -> 3866.38s]  Regenerates a substantial part of your immunity.
[3866.38s -> 3866.88s]  Cool.
[3873.61s -> 3873.85s]  Huh?
[3873.85s -> 3874.57s]  What are you doing?
[3875.64s -> 3878.36s]  When you crouch and look down and move left and right,
[3878.36s -> 3879.40s]  your arms are just like...
[3879.40s -> 3879.80s]  I don't know.
[3879.80s -> 3881.80s]  I'm really coming...
[3881.80s -> 3883.48s]  You're holding a weapon, so it's probably not doing it.
[3883.48s -> 3883.96s]  Oh.
[3883.96s -> 3885.66s]  I think you press the X to put it away.
[3885.66s -> 3888.17s]  Did you turn your FOV up?
[3888.17s -> 3889.48s]  Yeah.
[3889.48s -> 3891.00s]  All right, let's get out of here.
[3891.00s -> 3892.04s]  I don't want to throw up.
[3892.04s -> 3894.62s]  Wait, we got Zeds.
[3894.62s -> 3896.22s]  Are you going to say that every time?
[3896.22s -> 3897.74s]  We should scavenge down here.
[3897.74s -> 3898.70s]  Yeah, that's true.
[3898.70s -> 3899.74s]  That's a lot of stuff.
[3899.74s -> 3900.14s]  All right.
[3900.86s -> 3902.06s]  Let's just clear out these Zeds.
[3902.62s -> 3905.39s]  I'm going to say that every time we see a new room of zombies.
[3905.39s -> 3905.87s]  I think.
[3905.87s -> 3906.75s]  We got fighters.
[3907.71s -> 3914.41s]  That is like the E3 party audio of all these single-player games, by the way.
[3914.41s -> 3915.77s]  Watch out, walkers.
[3915.77s -> 3916.81s]  We got Zeds.
[3916.81s -> 3918.33s]  Fighters incoming.
[3918.33s -> 3921.05s]  I just love how in every zombie show,
[3921.05s -> 3922.73s]  they have to call them something different
[3922.73s -> 3924.73s]  and they can't do what someone else has already done,
[3924.73s -> 3926.17s]  so they can't just be zombies.
[3926.73s -> 3928.01s]  They can't be walkers.
[3928.01s -> 3929.05s]  They have to be like...
[3930.73s -> 3931.85s]  I don't know.
[3931.85s -> 3933.13s]  You hear some weird ones.
[3933.13s -> 3933.69s]  How do you throw?
[3934.57s -> 3938.20s]  How do I throw Malte?
[3939.16s -> 3941.40s]  You have to have one on the middle mouse button.
[3942.36s -> 3944.99s]  Got it.
[3947.13s -> 3947.45s]  Got it.
[3948.59s -> 3950.03s]  I love the smell of human flesh.
[3952.60s -> 3954.76s]  I thought they weren't humans anymore.
[3954.76s -> 3955.00s]  Huh?
[3957.47s -> 3957.95s]  They aren't.
[3957.95s -> 3960.64s]  They just have our flesh.
[3960.64s -> 3961.52s]  Get off my buddy.
[3966.81s -> 3968.01s]  What the fuck?
[3968.01s -> 3969.05s]  Why are they...
[3969.05s -> 3970.25s]  What did you just do?
[3970.89s -> 3972.89s]  That's not what fire extinguishers do.
[3972.89s -> 3974.73s]  They don't light on fire.
[3974.73s -> 3976.32s]  What happened?
[3976.32s -> 3978.48s]  I hit a fire extinguisher
[3978.48s -> 3980.80s]  and flames were coming out of it and it blew up.
[3981.44s -> 3983.20s]  It's contents under pressure, dude.
[3984.00s -> 3985.92s]  But there was literal flames.
[3988.33s -> 3988.65s]  Here.
[3988.65s -> 3989.37s]  Let me heal you up.
[3990.70s -> 3991.66s]  What is making this like...
[3992.94s -> 3994.06s]  It's kind of annoying me.
[3994.62s -> 3995.10s]  I don't know.
[3996.06s -> 3997.58s]  This guy's still alive?
[3998.94s -> 4001.64s]  Help me kill this guy.
[4001.64s -> 4002.92s]  No, I'm scavenging.
[4004.44s -> 4005.24s]  We got some alcohol.
[4005.24s -> 4005.96s]  We're going to party.
[4005.96s -> 4006.76s]  There's three more.
[4007.80s -> 4008.92s]  Oh, God.
[4009.56s -> 4010.28s]  You keep him busy.
[4010.28s -> 4011.32s]  Oh, never mind.
[4011.32s -> 4011.96s]  I thought it was a bomb.
[4020.09s -> 4021.37s]  Where are these people coming from?
[4024.73s -> 4025.77s]  I think they're using the...
[4025.85s -> 4026.41s]  Bro, let's...
[4027.60s -> 4028.16s]  That reaction...
[4028.16s -> 4028.48s]  What you getting?
[4028.48s -> 4029.12s]  We got to go.
[4029.12s -> 4030.08s]  That reaction was like,
[4030.08s -> 4031.04s]  I'm about to crash.
[4032.97s -> 4034.81s]  I'm about to crash my car.
[4034.81s -> 4036.25s]  Like, oh my God.
[4037.93s -> 4038.25s]  Bro.
[4045.12s -> 4046.24s]  We've scavenged pretty much everything
[4046.24s -> 4047.36s]  we can scavenge from down here.
[4048.00s -> 4048.56s]  I haven't.
[4049.85s -> 4050.65s]  I'm on low health.
[4051.29s -> 4051.61s]  Are you?
[4052.33s -> 4053.77s]  No, don't crush the mushrooms.
[4053.77s -> 4054.33s]  What am I doing?
[4061.31s -> 4062.75s]  These guys have honey on them?
[4062.75s -> 4064.83s]  Oh, that beeping that you're saying is so annoying
[4064.83s -> 4066.51s]  is your immunity being critical.
[4067.58s -> 4068.38s]  I mean, I just took a mushroom.
[4068.38s -> 4069.02s]  Because we're in the dark.
[4070.19s -> 4071.31s]  Oh, well, I just heard it.
[4072.27s -> 4072.99s]  I got to...
[4072.99s -> 4073.55s]  We got to go.
[4074.11s -> 4075.15s]  We actually do have to go,
[4075.15s -> 4076.59s]  but we need to actually be careful
[4076.59s -> 4078.35s]  because we're low on health and shit.
[4083.15s -> 4083.95s]  I need some honey.
[4084.43s -> 4086.27s]  Oh, I do have IV heal.
[4086.91s -> 4087.87s]  How critical is your health?
[4088.83s -> 4089.39s]  Very low.
[4089.39s -> 4090.51s]  I mean, I keep healing you
[4090.51s -> 4091.31s]  and I don't have any left.
[4091.31s -> 4092.91s]  Well, let me return the favor here.
[4092.91s -> 4093.41s]  Okay.
[4094.75s -> 4095.25s]  Thank you.
[4096.25s -> 4096.75s]  Okay.
[4097.95s -> 4099.23s]  You're low on health.
[4099.23s -> 4100.03s]  Stop doing that.
[4105.28s -> 4107.84s]  Why is it doing that noise every five seconds?
[4108.56s -> 4111.58s]  Okay, where are we going?
[4111.58s -> 4112.46s]  I'm going...
[4112.46s -> 4113.02s]  Where are we going?
[4113.02s -> 4113.58s]  Okay, where are we?
[4113.58s -> 4114.46s]  Wait, hold on.
[4114.46s -> 4116.46s]  We need to go to the mission marker
[4117.18s -> 4118.38s]  and find a place to sleep.
[4119.26s -> 4120.06s]  It's daytime.
[4120.06s -> 4121.02s]  Why would we need to sleep?
[4121.02s -> 4122.14s]  Because we're tired.
[4122.94s -> 4123.66s]  I'm not tired.
[4126.24s -> 4127.04s]  I can keep going.
[4127.68s -> 4128.49s]  All right.
[4128.49s -> 4130.81s]  So where's our marker currently?
[4130.81s -> 4132.97s]  We don't have a quest.
[4132.97s -> 4134.41s]  We have one that we can do.
[4134.41s -> 4136.17s]  We have meet Hakann.
[4136.17s -> 4137.07s]  Oh, that's the guy.
[4137.71s -> 4138.51s]  Where is that?
[4138.59s -> 4139.39s]  That's over here.
[4140.03s -> 4140.59s]  We can go to that.
[4140.59s -> 4141.09s]  Okay, let's go.
[4144.38s -> 4145.26s]  We've already met him.
[4146.08s -> 4147.76s]  Well, we have to do more missions with him.
[4147.76s -> 4148.48s]  It's like GTA.
[4154.84s -> 4155.64s]  I'm bored of him.
[4156.20s -> 4162.46s]  Oh, we got enforcers.
[4163.58s -> 4164.62s]  Is that a bad thing or a good thing?
[4165.88s -> 4167.00s]  Ah, they've got spears.
[4167.56s -> 4168.92s]  Hey, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[4168.92s -> 4170.60s]  Come back here behind this bush, Gashkhan.
[4170.60s -> 4171.10s]  Okay.
[4171.64s -> 4172.91s]  What's the plan here?
[4173.87s -> 4174.67s]  We need their weapons.
[4175.31s -> 4177.60s]  I think we do need their weapons.
[4177.60s -> 4177.84s]  Okay.
[4177.84s -> 4179.28s]  You get behind one, I get behind one.
[4179.28s -> 4181.12s]  Let's see where they're situated here.
[4181.92s -> 4185.12s]  We've got this one facing us and then we've got one.
[4185.12s -> 4186.80s]  Okay, we've got two not facing us.
[4187.60s -> 4188.88s]  I don't think we actually can.
[4188.88s -> 4189.52s]  It's not letting me.
[4192.00s -> 4192.56s]  Yes, we can.
[4193.36s -> 4195.68s]  No, I meant like the actual instant kill takedown.
[4197.28s -> 4199.04s]  This guy's full of fucking knives.
[4201.04s -> 4203.52s]  He has so many knives coming out of his head.
[4203.52s -> 4204.40s]  Oh my god, I'm going to die.
[4205.44s -> 4207.58s]  Good luck.
[4208.60s -> 4209.08s]  He's almost dead.
[4209.08s -> 4209.80s]  Kill the guy on the ledge.
[4212.99s -> 4214.75s]  Don't push him off because now we can't loot him.
[4215.39s -> 4215.87s]  He fell.
[4215.87s -> 4216.83s]  Well, we can go down there.
[4216.83s -> 4217.71s]  I'm going down to loot him.
[4224.65s -> 4227.13s]  Kill the guys up here that are trying to attack me.
[4229.64s -> 4230.76s]  They're not trying to attack me.
[4231.48s -> 4232.97s]  Can I make anything?
[4234.33s -> 4234.97s]  Oh, easy.
[4236.75s -> 4237.31s]  Get some?
[4238.11s -> 4239.87s]  Get, get some is what he said.
[4242.38s -> 4243.26s]  He had shoes on him.
[4243.26s -> 4244.46s]  He didn't have a weapon on him.
[4244.46s -> 4245.58s]  He only had shoes.
[4246.54s -> 4251.58s]  And this guy's trying to dodge my attack so much that he's.
[4251.58s -> 4252.30s]  What the fuck?
[4256.64s -> 4257.92s]  Loot that guy too, please.
[4258.88s -> 4259.52s]  He didn't die.
[4262.24s -> 4263.44s]  Dude, what the fuck?
[4263.44s -> 4264.40s]  Stop dodging.
[4264.40s -> 4265.12s]  This is this guy's.
[4266.64s -> 4267.36s]  I need healing.
[4270.36s -> 4271.48s]  Oh my fucking god.
[4271.48s -> 4271.80s]  Okay.
[4271.80s -> 4273.88s]  Well, this is my character doing.
[4274.76s -> 4278.57s]  You push this one off too.
[4278.57s -> 4281.13s]  I was trying to throw knives at him and he killed himself.
[4281.93s -> 4285.12s]  Does he see if he has anything on him?
[4285.76s -> 4290.83s]  Oh, he does have this holy shit.
[4291.47s -> 4292.35s]  He's got a spear.
[4293.23s -> 4294.59s]  Oh my goodness.
[4294.59s -> 4296.75s]  It's a throwing spear, an opportunity weapon.
[4297.39s -> 4299.28s]  Where is that?
[4300.92s -> 4301.56s]  I didn't get one.
[4302.20s -> 4304.81s]  Oh, come up here.
[4304.81s -> 4305.93s]  There's a throwing spear on this guy.
[4306.81s -> 4307.85s]  He's not using it anymore.
[4307.85s -> 4308.25s]  Oh shit.
[4308.25s -> 4308.97s]  This is awesome.
[4308.97s -> 4309.13s]  Okay.
[4310.01s -> 4312.11s]  Where are you?
[4312.11s -> 4312.83s]  I got to heal first.
[4313.63s -> 4314.35s]  Come up here.
[4314.35s -> 4316.91s]  I also I've really I have no healing.
[4316.91s -> 4318.83s]  We have to find honey and stuff.
[4318.83s -> 4327.47s]  Keep your spear out because we need to use it.
[4327.47s -> 4328.19s]  I crafted it.
[4328.19s -> 4328.83s]  I dropped it.
[4328.83s -> 4329.95s]  There's another spear up here.
[4331.08s -> 4332.04s]  I have one already.
[4333.08s -> 4334.04s]  I think you can only hold one.
[4334.68s -> 4334.92s]  Yeah.
[4335.72s -> 4335.96s]  All right.
[4335.96s -> 4336.52s]  Let's go.
[4336.52s -> 4336.92s]  Well, hold on.
[4336.92s -> 4337.32s]  Hold on.
[4337.32s -> 4338.12s]  You see that guy down there?
[4339.53s -> 4339.93s]  Three.
[4340.73s -> 4341.45s]  Wait, hold on.
[4342.19s -> 4342.67s]  Three.
[4342.67s -> 4342.91s]  Yep.
[4343.47s -> 4343.63s]  Two.
[4344.35s -> 4345.07s]  One.
[4345.07s -> 4345.39s]  Action.
[4346.91s -> 4348.03s]  That was pretty sick.
[4348.03s -> 4348.83s]  I'm not going to lie.
[4348.83s -> 4349.71s]  That was really cool.
[4349.71s -> 4351.15s]  Let's go steal stuff.
[4351.15s -> 4352.11s]  He's definitely dead.
[4353.71s -> 4356.43s]  It was just like he was trying to cover up the graffiti.
[4356.99s -> 4358.73s]  Is that what he really was doing?
[4359.63s -> 4361.55s]  Hey, oh, medicine.
[4361.55s -> 4363.74s]  You had two heels on him.
[4363.74s -> 4365.42s]  Yeah, we don't need to find honey.
[4365.42s -> 4366.86s]  We just need to kill enforcers.
[4368.22s -> 4370.83s]  I don't have that in my inventory.
[4370.83s -> 4371.47s]  I can heal you.
[4371.47s -> 4372.35s]  You come over here.
[4372.35s -> 4376.17s]  Oh, no, you're good.
[4376.17s -> 4376.81s]  Yeah, no, I'm good.
[4379.69s -> 4381.96s]  Let's keep going here.
[4381.96s -> 4382.68s]  Get their attention.
[4386.25s -> 4387.45s]  You didn't throw it far enough, I don't think.
[4392.12s -> 4394.49s]  All right.
[4394.49s -> 4395.16s]  Okay.
[4395.16s -> 4395.96s]  Yeah, that was that.
[4395.96s -> 4397.48s]  That barely hurt this guy.
[4398.44s -> 4401.34s]  Probably a special effect of the explosion.
[4401.34s -> 4404.14s]  I mean, like they're all they're all feeling pretty okay.
[4405.02s -> 4406.22s]  Spears probably do so much damage.
[4413.95s -> 4415.15s]  Is there a way to charge up a swing?
[4415.15s -> 4416.91s]  I probably learn later.
[4417.55s -> 4419.07s]  Yeah, I don't think we can yet.
[4420.11s -> 4422.51s]  I think we got to do like the main quest.
[4422.51s -> 4423.87s]  I know we keep getting too distracted.
[4423.87s -> 4424.67s]  We really do.
[4424.67s -> 4425.71s]  Oh, there's no spear here.
[4426.51s -> 4429.64s]  What's the guy doing?
[4435.37s -> 4436.73s]  All right, let's go, please.
[4436.73s -> 4436.97s]  Okay.
[4437.61s -> 4439.77s]  This is like the starting area we were in.
[4439.77s -> 4441.53s]  I mean, this game reminds me of a video game.
[4442.25s -> 4443.69s]  Yeah, we're going to go speak to Hakan.
[4445.93s -> 4446.65s]  Hey, on that point.
[4446.65s -> 4446.89s]  Wait.
[4447.77s -> 4449.61s]  Oh, I think we have combat points.
[4449.61s -> 4450.09s]  I have one.
[4451.61s -> 4452.25s]  I don't.
[4452.25s -> 4453.39s]  Perfect dodge.
[4453.39s -> 4458.68s]  You have the XP bonus.
[4458.68s -> 4460.12s]  Oh, I like that.
[4460.12s -> 4461.16s]  I'm going to do air kick.
[4462.32s -> 4463.04s]  Are you serious?
[4463.68s -> 4474.62s]  Are you looking at?
[4474.62s -> 4476.12s]  Hold on.
[4476.12s -> 4476.76s]  Crouch.
[4476.76s -> 4477.72s]  You hear these guys talking?
[4479.85s -> 4480.25s]  Kind of.
[4481.56s -> 4481.96s]  Where are they?
[4485.44s -> 4487.44s]  They're just saying the same thing over and over again for me.
[4488.40s -> 4488.96s]  Got a hammer?
[4488.96s -> 4489.52s]  Let's get closer.
[4489.52s -> 4497.42s]  Got a hammer?
[4497.42s -> 4497.98s]  We got two.
[4497.98s -> 4500.09s]  Yeah, you can open there.
[4500.09s -> 4501.61s]  Don't why would you kick it open?
[4502.49s -> 4503.76s]  Taking so long.
[4511.79s -> 4513.23s]  Wait, somebody's about to blow a horn.
[4515.69s -> 4516.57s]  What's with the horn?
[4518.73s -> 4519.13s]  I don't.
[4519.13s -> 4520.25s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[4520.25s -> 4521.37s]  What's taking so long?
[4521.37s -> 4523.29s]  It was just a horn indicator on the screen.
[4524.41s -> 4525.13s]  Like they were going to go.
[4527.95s -> 4529.31s]  Well, they were going to rally the troops.
[4532.22s -> 4533.26s]  I mean, these are like tough guys.
[4533.26s -> 4534.30s]  This guy's wearing camo.
[4538.27s -> 4539.39s]  Lots of stuff over in the corner.
[4539.95s -> 4541.82s]  You can craft a new item.
[4542.75s -> 4544.03s]  Ooh, what is it?
[4544.03s -> 4549.29s]  You can't craft a new item.
[4549.29s -> 4552.86s]  We got a question mark over here.
[4552.86s -> 4554.30s]  You can't craft any new items.
[4554.30s -> 4554.94s]  Lying game.
[4555.66s -> 4563.63s]  Want to go to this question mark?
[4563.63s -> 4565.31s]  Yeah, I'm just getting the loot, man.
[4565.31s -> 4566.51s]  We got a blue over here.
[4567.23s -> 4568.11s]  All right, what's this?
[4568.11s -> 4568.91s]  Is it a random?
[4569.95s -> 4570.91s]  Let's go to this blue.
[4570.91s -> 4573.07s]  I kind of like how they just add a random
[4574.51s -> 4576.03s]  stranger quest like GTA.
[4576.75s -> 4577.87s]  It's another bandit.
[4577.87s -> 4578.83s]  We got to chase this guy.
[4581.71s -> 4583.04s]  It hurts so much.
[4586.24s -> 4588.32s]  Oh, it's just a bandit.
[4588.32s -> 4591.32s]  It is just a bandit quest.
[4595.96s -> 4596.92s]  Why can't I pick it up?
[4602.75s -> 4604.75s]  I feel like I just got out with my life.
[4604.75s -> 4607.15s]  That was like my life flash before my eyes.
[4610.54s -> 4611.98s]  Oh, holy shit.
[4614.70s -> 4615.90s]  We got to get Spider-Man.
[4616.70s -> 4618.06s]  I can't climb that fast.
[4621.48s -> 4622.64s]  I'm going to cut him off.
[4623.28s -> 4624.08s]  He fell.
[4624.08s -> 4624.58s]  What?
[4625.20s -> 4625.70s]  He fell.
[4626.64s -> 4627.14s]  I fell.
[4628.00s -> 4630.20s]  I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him.
[4630.84s -> 4633.95s]  Oh, shit.
[4633.95s -> 4634.43s]  I didn't get him.
[4634.43s -> 4635.79s]  I'm out of stamina.
[4635.79s -> 4636.51s]  He's still going.
[4637.23s -> 4641.23s]  Did I get him?
[4642.03s -> 4642.53s]  I got him.
[4642.99s -> 4646.36s]  Okay, I'm coming.
[4646.36s -> 4647.08s]  Oh, no.
[4647.08s -> 4648.70s]  I alerted the horde.
[4650.06s -> 4651.34s]  My hand.
[4652.99s -> 4654.11s]  I didn't loot him yet.
[4654.11s -> 4654.91s]  I didn't loot him yet.
[4654.91s -> 4655.79s]  I don't have any weapons.
[4656.43s -> 4657.55s]  Do I have a weapon?
[4657.55s -> 4658.43s]  I got him, I got him.
[4658.99s -> 4660.43s]  Wait, I need to stop to loot it.
[4662.03s -> 4663.71s]  One, two, three, four cycles your weapons.
[4663.71s -> 4664.99s]  Inventory, you can equip weapons.
[4664.99s -> 4666.75s]  You probably keep picking them up and not realize them.
[4669.02s -> 4671.50s]  Okay.
[4671.50s -> 4673.80s]  Oh, germa powder.
[4674.44s -> 4675.16s]  Come up here.
[4675.16s -> 4675.66s]  Mm-hmm.
[4678.41s -> 4680.89s]  There are people every 10 feet.
[4682.46s -> 4682.70s]  Why?
[4682.70s -> 4684.14s]  These people have like a birdhouse?
[4688.41s -> 4690.41s]  Why are these guys wearing ski masks?
[4691.64s -> 4692.44s]  I don't...
[4692.44s -> 4696.20s]  They were both up here wearing ski masks tending to their beehives.
[4696.20s -> 4697.88s]  Oh, wait, because they don't want to get stung in the face.
[4697.88s -> 4698.44s]  That makes sense.
[4699.00s -> 4701.42s]  That doesn't make sense.
[4701.42s -> 4702.22s]  All right, we can actually craft them.
[4702.22s -> 4702.94s]  Oh, yeah.
[4702.94s -> 4704.22s]  We got chamomile and honey.
[4704.22s -> 4704.94s]  That's what they're doing.
[4704.94s -> 4705.74s]  They're healing up.
[4705.74s -> 4706.24s]  Okay.
[4707.32s -> 4707.80s]  You see this?
[4707.80s -> 4708.84s]  There's a police car down there.
[4708.84s -> 4709.72s]  A couple of zeds on it.
[4710.78s -> 4712.46s]  No, I didn't want to take the inhaler.
[4713.47s -> 4714.11s]  Oh, my God.
[4714.11s -> 4715.71s]  I probably needed to use that at some point.
[4715.71s -> 4716.21s]  Important.
[4716.99s -> 4722.89s]  Let me put this stuff on my bar.
[4724.20s -> 4724.52s]  Okay.
[4724.52s -> 4725.40s]  I have two weapons.
[4728.04s -> 4728.60s]  Okay.
[4728.60s -> 4732.35s]  I want to get in this police car.
[4732.35s -> 4733.77s]  There's so much shit up here, though.
[4733.77s -> 4734.41s]  Look at all this stuff.
[4735.37s -> 4737.85s]  There's so much stuff.
[4738.41s -> 4746.38s]  There's like shrooms.
[4746.38s -> 4748.38s]  There's beehives.
[4749.02s -> 4752.83s]  These guys had a little thing going on up here, huh?
[4752.83s -> 4753.33s]  Yeah.
[4754.03s -> 4755.22s]  All right.
[4755.52s -> 4756.72s]  They really figured this whole thing out.
[4757.44s -> 4759.21s]  I think there's gas in here.
[4759.77s -> 4762.52s]  They had an axe and a birdhouse.
[4762.52s -> 4763.16s]  How was the axe?
[4763.88s -> 4765.55s]  You know, it's a raggedy.
[4765.55s -> 4766.59s]  It's a ragged chopper.
[4766.59s -> 4767.39s]  You know what I'm talking about.
[4767.39s -> 4767.89s]  That's not bad.
[4767.89s -> 4768.75s]  Did we get in a police car?
[4768.75s -> 4769.47s]  19 damage.
[4770.11s -> 4773.02s]  Okay.
[4773.02s -> 4773.90s]  Let's try the police car.
[4774.46s -> 4778.20s]  Okay.
[4778.20s -> 4779.48s]  I'll distract them and you open it.
[4779.96s -> 4781.24s]  Where's the police car?
[4781.24s -> 4782.76s]  Right in front of us in the middle of the road.
[4782.76s -> 4783.24s]  I see.
[4783.24s -> 4783.74s]  Okay.
[4785.08s -> 4786.56s]  Yeah, I'm going to distract them.
[4787.44s -> 4788.40s]  How come I couldn't kick that guy?
[4788.40s -> 4789.20s]  I tried to do my kick.
[4789.84s -> 4791.12s]  I'm lowering him away.
[4791.12s -> 4791.62s]  Get in there.
[4794.78s -> 4795.28s]  I can do it.
[4795.82s -> 4796.62s]  I'm keeping him off you.
[4796.62s -> 4797.18s]  It's a lockpick.
[4797.18s -> 4797.66s]  It's a lockpick.
[4797.66s -> 4798.62s]  It's a lockpick.
[4798.62s -> 4799.18s]  I can't open it.
[4799.18s -> 4800.06s]  I have to do the lockpick.
[4800.06s -> 4800.22s]  I can't.
[4800.22s -> 4800.94s]  We have to kill these guys.
[4803.02s -> 4803.34s]  Okay.
[4803.34s -> 4803.82s]  I got you.
[4808.81s -> 4809.29s]  That what?
[4809.29s -> 4809.85s]  What?
[4809.85s -> 4810.65s]  That was it?
[4810.65s -> 4811.45s]  That was the sound?
[4813.05s -> 4816.86s]  Dude, watch my back.
[4817.58s -> 4818.70s]  They're all fighting me.
[4820.06s -> 4821.98s]  You have one person over there attacking you.
[4822.94s -> 4824.89s]  I've watched my freaking back.
[4825.53s -> 4830.78s]  Keep him off me.
[4831.50s -> 4832.46s]  I can do that.
[4832.46s -> 4833.18s]  You handle the car.
[4833.18s -> 4833.98s]  I'll do my work.
[4835.34s -> 4836.30s]  I'm out of stamina.
[4840.60s -> 4841.40s]  I almost got it.
[4847.29s -> 4848.17s]  There's a snake in here.
[4848.17s -> 4848.67s]  Get it.
[4851.69s -> 4852.19s]  All right.
[4852.73s -> 4853.53s]  We're in the clear.
[4855.84s -> 4856.34s]  Leather.
[4856.88s -> 4857.38s]  Leather.
[4858.64s -> 4859.14s]  Leather.
[4866.44s -> 4867.88s]  I don't know if we're being gate kept.
[4868.92s -> 4870.52s]  We can't find guns and cop cars.
[4871.32s -> 4873.32s]  Hey, what's this place?
[4874.04s -> 4880.16s]  We're getting distracted every five seconds.
[4880.16s -> 4881.44s]  Yeah, it's the terminal.
[4883.16s -> 4883.88s]  The main terminal.
[4892.41s -> 4894.78s]  My god.
[4896.33s -> 4896.83s]  Okay.
[4897.98s -> 4900.06s]  Are we about to do the first story mission of the game?
[4901.26s -> 4902.30s]  Oh, you went to Hakann?
[4902.86s -> 4903.58s]  He's the other way.
[4905.42s -> 4905.90s]  Let's go.
[4905.90s -> 4908.06s]  Dude, we've been going the wrong direction.
[4908.94s -> 4909.58s]  No, we're fine.
[4910.14s -> 4911.18s]  We got a little distracted.
[4911.18s -> 4912.06s]  We got a whole bunch of honey.
[4912.06s -> 4913.10s]  We got a whole bunch of heals.
[4913.10s -> 4913.66s]  We're equipped.
[4913.66s -> 4914.94s]  We know how the game works.
[4914.94s -> 4916.54s]  It's like that's all smooth sailing from here.
[4916.54s -> 4917.50s]  No more distractions.
[4917.50s -> 4917.90s]  We're running.
[4917.90s -> 4918.54s]  It's parkour.
[4919.52s -> 4920.24s]  Here to Sunday.
[4920.80s -> 4922.64s]  I hear people talk and ignore them.
[4922.64s -> 4925.84s]  But they're funny NPCs we can go kill.
[4925.84s -> 4926.72s]  Somebody's blowing their horn.
[4926.72s -> 4927.22s]  See?
[4933.68s -> 4935.60s]  ADHD should be illegal.
[4935.60s -> 4939.12s]  Okay.
[4939.12s -> 4941.95s]  I discovered the dark hollows.
[4945.10s -> 4946.06s]  There's a tank down there.
[4946.86s -> 4947.58s]  A tank?
[4947.58s -> 4948.08s]  Yeah.
[4948.54s -> 4949.98s]  We can really use that thing.
[4949.98s -> 4951.18s]  Maybe we can get like...
[4951.18s -> 4952.54s]  Wait, is that an Omega Zed?
[4953.34s -> 4954.78s]  It looks like an Omega Zed.
[4954.78s -> 4955.74s]  Is that Big Bertha?
[4958.26s -> 4959.78s]  There's explosives down there.
[4959.78s -> 4960.90s]  What should we do?
[4960.90s -> 4963.94s]  This is just like that one scene in that one show.
[4965.09s -> 4966.45s]  Like the tyrant is down there.
[4967.01s -> 4968.77s]  I got a Molotov.
[4968.77s -> 4970.05s]  Should we just throw it over there and see what happens?
[4974.69s -> 4975.65s]  You completely missed.
[4976.21s -> 4977.68s]  You're supposed to be the gamer.
[4978.64s -> 4980.08s]  I didn't know how far they throw.
[4980.72s -> 4986.85s]  Here we go.
[4986.85s -> 4987.17s]  All right.
[4987.81s -> 4990.37s]  Is it going to blow up the...
[4990.37s -> 4992.21s]  Oh, the propane tank is still not blown up.
[4995.71s -> 4996.21s]  Yikes.
[4997.20s -> 4997.76s]  There's ghosts.
[4997.76s -> 4998.72s]  There are ghosts.
[4998.72s -> 4999.44s]  Chain reaction.
[5000.08s -> 5001.52s]  Oh, whoa, dude.
[5001.52s -> 5002.02s]  Nice.
[5002.40s -> 5002.90s]  Wait.
[5003.28s -> 5004.45s]  That guy's flying.
[5007.54s -> 5008.42s]  There goes another one.
[5008.42s -> 5008.92s]  Another one.
[5012.16s -> 5014.32s]  I'm not sure if we heard them or not.
[5014.32s -> 5019.22s]  Okay, so...
[5020.08s -> 5020.72s]  They're climbing.
[5021.44s -> 5022.56s]  All right, they're climbing.
[5022.56s -> 5023.20s]  I'm frozen.
[5023.20s -> 5023.68s]  What do we do?
[5023.68s -> 5024.64s]  All right, let's go back.
[5025.60s -> 5027.04s]  I don't think we can do that right now.
[5027.04s -> 5027.84s]  I think we can.
[5027.84s -> 5028.64s]  I think you're giving up.
[5029.60s -> 5030.72s]  It's a tyrant down there.
[5030.72s -> 5031.52s]  We don't have a...
[5031.52s -> 5032.72s]  We don't have a gun or anything.
[5032.72s -> 5034.24s]  There's more explosives.
[5034.24s -> 5035.44s]  All right, go for it.
[5035.44s -> 5035.76s]  Ready?
[5035.76s -> 5036.26s]  Oh, my God.
[5037.70s -> 5038.20s]  Ready?
[5039.20s -> 5039.92s]  One, two...
[5039.92s -> 5040.80s]  Wait, I'm not ready.
[5040.80s -> 5041.30s]  I'm not...
[5042.08s -> 5043.28s]  All right, I'm waiting.
[5046.37s -> 5047.49s]  When do you think you'll be ready?
[5047.49s -> 5049.09s]  I'm just curious.
[5049.09s -> 5050.05s]  Okay, I'm going.
[5050.05s -> 5050.61s]  I'm going.
[5050.61s -> 5051.73s]  I'm going.
[5051.73s -> 5052.23s]  All right, going.
[5055.49s -> 5056.85s]  Power attacks cannot be blocked.
[5056.85s -> 5057.33s]  All right, what was it?
[5057.33s -> 5057.83s]  What was here?
[5058.45s -> 5060.90s]  Something in the tank.
[5063.97s -> 5064.45s]  Holy shit.
[5064.45s -> 5064.95s]  Okay, what is it?
[5066.74s -> 5067.24s]  Open it up.
[5067.78s -> 5076.35s]  Dude, there's something we can do with the tank.
[5076.35s -> 5077.07s]  The back of the tank.
[5077.79s -> 5082.21s]  They're all coming for me.
[5082.21s -> 5083.25s]  See if you can get it.
[5083.25s -> 5083.81s]  I'm hurting.
[5084.45s -> 5084.69s]  What?
[5084.69s -> 5085.25s]  The back of the tank?
[5085.25s -> 5086.21s]  I don't see anything.
[5086.21s -> 5086.93s]  At the back of the tank,
[5086.93s -> 5087.89s]  there's like a lever you can pull.
[5091.54s -> 5092.66s]  All right, actually, you distract him.
[5093.38s -> 5094.98s]  Are you talking about the spear?
[5094.98s -> 5095.70s]  There's a lever here.
[5096.42s -> 5097.14s]  God damn it.
[5098.18s -> 5099.34s]  At the back of the tank,
[5099.34s -> 5100.14s]  right at the very back,
[5100.14s -> 5100.78s]  at the bottom of the tank,
[5100.78s -> 5101.82s]  there's like a lever.
[5104.43s -> 5105.07s]  I'm going to die.
[5106.03s -> 5106.53s]  You all right?
[5107.31s -> 5108.43s]  All right, just run away.
[5108.43s -> 5108.93s]  Run away.
[5109.39s -> 5111.73s]  Let's get out.
[5113.20s -> 5114.88s]  I keep pressing E to use
[5116.18s -> 5117.54s]  and I keep kicking things.
[5118.34s -> 5120.42s]  Just rebind it.
[5121.06s -> 5125.60s]  Can I craft like a bomb or something?
[5126.24s -> 5133.54s]  I'm going to craft some knives.
[5133.54s -> 5134.26s]  Just leave them.
[5136.18s -> 5136.74s]  I want to.
[5136.74s -> 5137.94s]  I mean, we already did.
[5137.94s -> 5139.14s]  We committed to this bullshit.
[5139.86s -> 5142.34s]  There's nobody here.
[5143.14s -> 5143.70s]  Are you kidding me?
[5143.70s -> 5144.26s]  I think I can get it.
[5144.82s -> 5147.54s]  Oh my God.
[5148.16s -> 5148.66s]  Oh my God.
[5149.28s -> 5150.15s]  Oh my God.
[5150.77s -> 5152.00s]  Oh my God.
[5152.00s -> 5152.50s]  I'm going to get it.
[5153.20s -> 5154.84s]  What is it?
[5156.19s -> 5156.69s]  Rations.
[5158.85s -> 5159.65s]  All right, the hard lock.
[5159.65s -> 5160.53s]  Oh, no, don't do it.
[5161.81s -> 5162.31s]  Hard lock.
[5162.93s -> 5164.13s]  All right, help me.
[5164.13s -> 5165.33s]  Just protect me.
[5167.68s -> 5169.66s]  Where did the Tyrant go?
[5170.30s -> 5170.80s]  I don't know.
[5171.34s -> 5173.94s]  How do I throw this?
[5173.94s -> 5174.42s]  Ignite it?
[5174.42s -> 5175.22s]  I can't ignite it.
[5175.22s -> 5175.72s]  Why not?
[5176.50s -> 5177.30s]  You have to hold X.
[5178.58s -> 5179.22s]  All right, watch out.
[5187.39s -> 5188.67s]  I think we can just clear it.
[5188.67s -> 5189.31s]  Just clear it out.
[5189.31s -> 5190.83s]  Yeah, I'm clearing.
[5193.50s -> 5194.46s]  The Tyrant left.
[5195.82s -> 5196.32s]  Yeah, he was.
[5197.66s -> 5198.38s]  That's good for us.
[5200.96s -> 5211.70s]  All right.
[5211.70s -> 5213.38s]  I think there's one of these two left, right?
[5217.76s -> 5219.57s]  Are we breathing in chemicals somewhere?
[5220.61s -> 5222.70s]  Oh, this one's a lock as well.
[5223.34s -> 5224.06s]  All right, this is perfect.
[5224.70s -> 5225.50s]  Loot everything.
[5227.39s -> 5228.67s]  Don't read this comment, Jerma.
[5228.67s -> 5229.17s]  What?
[5230.77s -> 5231.17s]  You...
[5231.17s -> 5231.73s]  Oh, man.
[5232.45s -> 5236.37s]  This is actually cool.
[5238.24s -> 5239.52s]  I'm breaking all my lockpicks.
[5240.16s -> 5242.37s]  Somebody said press C when you land to break your fall.
[5244.18s -> 5244.58s]  I can't.
[5244.58s -> 5245.22s]  I can't do this.
[5245.86s -> 5246.34s]  Oh, shit.
[5246.34s -> 5246.82s]  How many?
[5246.82s -> 5248.10s]  I think I have one.
[5248.10s -> 5248.98s]  I have one left.
[5249.86s -> 5253.06s]  Okay, where would you see the most non-resistance?
[5253.06s -> 5254.02s]  I didn't see anything.
[5256.64s -> 5258.08s]  Did you do the ambulance?
[5261.33s -> 5270.40s]  Yeah.
[5270.40s -> 5271.04s]  Holy shit.
[5271.04s -> 5271.52s]  What the hell?
[5272.08s -> 5275.36s]  Yeah, we're just like not good enough to do very hard yet.
[5277.14s -> 5277.78s]  I'm not getting anything.
[5282.32s -> 5282.96s]  Oh, my God.
[5286.99s -> 5287.71s]  I got it.
[5287.71s -> 5288.19s]  Holy shit.
[5288.19s -> 5288.59s]  I got it.
[5289.47s -> 5290.03s]  What a gamer.
[5290.03s -> 5291.31s]  It was all the way to the right.
[5293.04s -> 5296.40s]  Dust filter, solid shoes, and rations.
[5297.28s -> 5298.96s]  A bolted bludgeon.
[5299.76s -> 5300.72s]  28 damage.
[5301.52s -> 5303.44s]  Yeah, I feel like we're being gate kept from guns.
[5304.16s -> 5306.72s]  You don't find it in like the armored carrier.
[5306.72s -> 5307.84s]  Like, come on, man.
[5309.25s -> 5310.45s]  Didn't you say there was another thing to open?
[5311.01s -> 5312.29s]  This one here, too?
[5313.36s -> 5313.60s]  All right.
[5313.60s -> 5314.40s]  Let me see if I can get this.
[5322.05s -> 5322.37s]  I am...
[5322.93s -> 5324.21s]  Trust me when I say this.
[5324.21s -> 5325.57s]  I'm the lockpick guy from now on.
[5326.29s -> 5326.93s]  I trust you.
[5332.40s -> 5333.76s]  Please play Sam and Max VR.
[5334.78s -> 5337.02s]  Well, I put VR in the box and it's in the closet now,
[5337.02s -> 5338.22s]  so it's not going to happen.
[5340.08s -> 5341.68s]  I do own the game, though.
[5341.68s -> 5342.80s]  So eventually you'll see it.
[5343.36s -> 5349.07s]  Okay, can we like get in here?
[5349.55s -> 5354.27s]  There's a random person over there.
[5354.99s -> 5357.39s]  Hey, can we make it to this main quest right up here?
[5357.39s -> 5358.19s]  Meet Hakan?
[5358.19s -> 5358.99s]  Yeah, let's...
[5358.99s -> 5361.31s]  Okay, that's enough.
[5361.31s -> 5362.82s]  We've been playing for an hour and a half,
[5362.82s -> 5364.02s]  and I know we're having a lot of fun.
[5364.02s -> 5365.22s]  This is actually a really good time,
[5365.94s -> 5367.78s]  but we gotta...
[5367.78s -> 5369.38s]  We can't just not do the whole game.
[5369.38s -> 5370.10s]  We're having a good time,
[5370.10s -> 5371.78s]  but we need to like put it to an end right now
[5371.78s -> 5373.22s]  and like talk to this main quest guy.
[5373.22s -> 5373.86s]  Yep.
[5373.86s -> 5378.27s]  Hakan, you're a better climber than one crazy girl I used to know.
[5379.23s -> 5379.87s]  She was something.
[5379.87s -> 5381.15s]  Have you ever played Castlevania Symphony?
[5381.15s -> 5382.27s]  I climbed the tallest building.
[5382.27s -> 5382.83s]  Nope.
[5382.83s -> 5383.07s]  Right.
[5384.14s -> 5385.34s]  I feel like I lived it, you know?
[5385.98s -> 5387.50s]  I just like you playing the game is kind of boring.
[5387.50s -> 5389.10s]  There's an ad that might be...
[5389.10s -> 5390.80s]  Did you play Vampire Survivors?
[5394.50s -> 5395.90s]  That's a stir game.
[5396.54s -> 5397.50s]  I think we talked about it.
[5397.50s -> 5398.46s]  Yeah, that's a stir game.
[5400.96s -> 5402.08s]  I kept reading on the Reddit
[5402.08s -> 5404.16s]  that it's like a ripoff of Magical Survivors.
[5404.16s -> 5405.84s]  So on the plane trip out here,
[5405.84s -> 5407.84s]  I was like, oh, I'm gonna like download Magical Survivors
[5407.84s -> 5410.08s]  and like see what the one it was based on
[5410.08s -> 5411.44s]  and support the original.
[5411.44s -> 5412.56s]  And shit's not on iOS.
[5414.16s -> 5414.72s]  Is it actually?
[5415.44s -> 5416.48s]  It's like Android only.
[5418.56s -> 5421.60s]  I wonder why that one didn't take off.
[5427.14s -> 5427.86s]  All right, tunnels.
[5428.74s -> 5431.30s]  Dude, the tunnel troll.
[5431.30s -> 5431.78s]  Here we go.
[5436.03s -> 5437.63s]  Oh, wait, we're tunnel trolling?
[5437.63s -> 5439.07s]  Get to the station through the metro.
[5440.83s -> 5444.83s]  Wait, is there like...
[5444.83s -> 5445.23s]  Hold on.
[5446.50s -> 5447.46s]  Make sure that we can...
[5448.18s -> 5449.14s]  I don't want to just leave here
[5449.14s -> 5452.50s]  without something we can do or crafts of items.
[5453.38s -> 5456.61s]  Well, that's the objective.
[5457.33s -> 5458.77s]  Okay, so I'm just making sure.
[5459.65s -> 5461.30s]  Wait, which one is the objective?
[5462.02s -> 5464.90s]  Oh, down here, 20 meters down.
[5464.90s -> 5467.04s]  All right, it's nighttime, by the way.
[5467.04s -> 5468.56s]  So this is where it gets a little hairy.
[5478.88s -> 5486.83s]  Where did you get this two-hander?
[5487.63s -> 5488.99s]  It was in the military truck.
[5488.99s -> 5489.71s]  I got the good loot.
[5490.27s -> 5490.91s]  Oh, what?
[5492.35s -> 5497.31s]  We have to pick this lock.
[5498.82s -> 5500.34s]  Yeah, so clear the zeds, dude.
[5501.06s -> 5502.82s]  You're the one with the big two-hander.
[5502.82s -> 5503.94s]  I'm hitting them.
[5508.16s -> 5510.05s]  That was actually pretty cool.
[5511.01s -> 5512.77s]  Why did I just do the thing from God of War?
[5513.57s -> 5514.21s]  I threw...
[5516.21s -> 5519.57s]  I just recalled Mediolnir.
[5520.61s -> 5522.02s]  Hey, you're the lockpick guy.
[5522.02s -> 5522.42s]  Let's go.
[5522.42s -> 5522.90s]  That's me.
[5524.70s -> 5525.42s]  Zeds are coming.
[5525.42s -> 5526.14s]  Something exploded.
[5526.14s -> 5526.62s]  Don't know why.
[5532.67s -> 5533.07s]  That's me.
[5533.07s -> 5533.87s]  First try, Andy.
[5534.43s -> 5534.91s]  Bandits.
[5543.28s -> 5544.56s]  I think we should just leave.
[5545.84s -> 5547.20s]  I want these guys dead
[5547.20s -> 5549.04s]  for ever even considering fighting.
[5551.18s -> 5552.22s]  He had Siggy's name.
[5554.38s -> 5556.30s]  All right, let's go before we get killed.
[5558.06s -> 5559.78s]  My God.
[5559.78s -> 5560.26s]  I grabbed...
[5561.14s -> 5561.46s]  How do...
[5562.34s -> 5562.66s]  Help!
[5563.54s -> 5565.30s]  I don't know how to do it.
[5565.30s -> 5565.78s]  I'm honest.
[5568.83s -> 5569.95s]  Running out of stamina works.
[5572.83s -> 5573.63s]  Oh, shit!
[5573.63s -> 5574.27s]  Okay, I grabbed it.
[5574.27s -> 5574.59s]  I'm fine.
[5575.23s -> 5591.81s]  Ooh, pills.
[5592.37s -> 5592.77s]  Aspirin.
[5593.33s -> 5593.81s]  Pills here.
[5594.85s -> 5595.41s]  Cigarettes.
[5596.21s -> 5598.43s]  Hey, where are the rifles?
[5599.23s -> 5600.11s]  Where are the shotguns?
[5601.26s -> 5602.14s]  My chat is telling me
[5602.14s -> 5603.82s]  there are no guns in the future.
[5603.82s -> 5604.78s]  There are no guns in the game?
[5606.85s -> 5607.57s]  Good.
[5607.57s -> 5608.69s]  They said there's like two.
[5608.69s -> 5609.33s]  Like these gamers
[5609.33s -> 5611.01s]  have to fucking actually play the game.
[5611.01s -> 5612.37s]  They kind of spoiled it.
[5612.37s -> 5613.65s]  You know, I would have talked about it
[5613.65s -> 5615.17s]  for like six more hours, but...
[5615.17s -> 5616.05s]  Oh, we want guns.
[5616.05s -> 5617.49s]  Now the gamers actually have to fucking
[5617.49s -> 5618.05s]  play the game
[5618.05s -> 5619.17s]  and not just like shoot stuff.
[5620.05s -> 5620.29s]  Yeah.
[5632.90s -> 5633.78s]  Oh, shit!
[5634.42s -> 5635.22s]  Gary?
[5635.22s -> 5636.82s]  It was a fucking cockroach.
[5637.54s -> 5639.70s]  This is not how you would crawl through this.
[5641.14s -> 5642.42s]  You are deliberately
[5642.42s -> 5643.94s]  putting your ass in my face.
[5643.94s -> 5644.50s]  Deliberately.
[5645.14s -> 5646.10s]  I'm a spider.
[5646.74s -> 5647.54s]  Let me go in front of you
[5647.54s -> 5648.18s]  just so you can see.
[5648.18s -> 5650.50s]  This is not how somebody crawls through a vent.
[5650.50s -> 5652.50s]  I've been waiting years for you to say that.
[5652.50s -> 5653.14s]  Look at this.
[5656.77s -> 5659.79s]  Okay.
[5659.79s -> 5660.91s]  You wouldn't even fit doing that.
[5660.91s -> 5661.55s]  Wait, watch out.
[5661.55s -> 5662.27s]  Watch out, Zeds.
[5662.83s -> 5664.24s]  You get the one on the left.
[5664.24s -> 5664.48s]  All right.
[5664.48s -> 5666.24s]  You have to give one community sub
[5666.24s -> 5668.00s]  every time you say that from now on.
[5668.00s -> 5668.48s]  Say what?
[5669.20s -> 5670.24s]  Oh, Zeds, look out.
[5670.88s -> 5671.36s]  Oh, shit!
[5671.36s -> 5673.20s]  I owe a hundred community subs to my chat.
[5673.20s -> 5674.00s]  I hope I can do it.
[5674.80s -> 5676.46s]  You didn't do the one on the left.
[5677.74s -> 5680.77s]  My credit card got declined
[5680.77s -> 5682.45s]  like five times last time.
[5682.45s -> 5683.57s]  I hope I can do it this time.
[5684.85s -> 5688.72s]  Okay, I need a weapon.
[5688.72s -> 5689.44s]  Do you have any extras?
[5690.18s -> 5691.14s]  I do.
[5691.14s -> 5692.58s]  I don't know if I can drop them.
[5692.58s -> 5694.50s]  Oh, I can.
[5694.50s -> 5696.34s]  Oh, I got to take shrooms.
[5696.34s -> 5697.62s]  I dropped a slicer for you.
[5698.42s -> 5702.56s]  That didn't do anything.
[5702.56s -> 5703.52s]  My immunity is still low.
[5706.14s -> 5707.34s]  It adds like a minute.
[5707.34s -> 5708.86s]  It doesn't add like a full timer.
[5709.42s -> 5709.98s]  Okay, let's go.
[5709.98s -> 5710.38s]  We got to hurry.
[5710.38s -> 5712.06s]  It only adds like 30 seconds.
[5712.86s -> 5718.70s]  Okay, we got to speed run this.
[5719.34s -> 5720.32s]  The Zeds are coming.
[5720.96s -> 5722.16s]  That's one.
[5722.16s -> 5725.73s]  I'm in the tunnel.
[5725.73s -> 5727.57s]  Now watch out for the infected.
[5727.57s -> 5730.05s]  There might be a few or a few dozen.
[5730.05s -> 5732.21s]  You really are playing chivalry at this point now.
[5734.99s -> 5736.67s]  It looks like you're play fighting,
[5736.67s -> 5738.27s]  but you don't actually want to swing that.
[5738.27s -> 5739.15s]  You're just watching.
[5739.15s -> 5740.75s]  Do I give you my weapon so you can watch?
[5741.95s -> 5747.97s]  All right, take some more mushrooms.
[5747.97s -> 5749.41s]  We actually do have to go your right and run.
[5750.05s -> 5750.93s]  There's mushrooms right here.
[5751.73s -> 5752.93s]  Oh, sick.
[5752.93s -> 5753.89s]  Watch out, infected.
[5754.69s -> 5758.16s]  Don't alert them.
[5758.16s -> 5759.65s]  You can just crawl through.
[5760.37s -> 5763.87s]  Can you do the tutorial, man?
[5763.87s -> 5764.59s]  Oh, watch out.
[5767.81s -> 5771.33s]  Wait, oh, sick, sick.
[5772.13s -> 5775.23s]  What happened to don't alert the Zeds?
[5775.79s -> 5777.07s]  They were going to see me.
[5777.07s -> 5777.71s]  It was fate.
[5780.27s -> 5780.91s]  Oh, you said it.
[5780.91s -> 5783.47s]  Now you owe me 100 gifts for the community.
[5784.45s -> 5785.49s]  All right, this is lockpick door.
[5786.13s -> 5789.82s]  Lockpick guy.
[5789.82s -> 5790.54s]  Can you please do it?
[5790.54s -> 5791.02s]  I got you.
[5791.82s -> 5793.26s]  If you're actually going to protect me, I will.
[5793.26s -> 5799.97s]  I'm in.
[5799.97s -> 5801.95s]  Okay, shut the door.
[5802.67s -> 5805.82s]  Oh, there's a container in here somewhere.
[5806.46s -> 5808.51s]  They just punched me through the door.
[5810.05s -> 5811.01s]  48 meters somewhere.
[5822.54s -> 5825.18s]  That's definitely in here somewhere.
[5825.18s -> 5825.42s]  Cool.
[5826.30s -> 5829.76s]  Our immunity is getting even lower.
[5835.84s -> 5839.49s]  We're close, though.
[5839.49s -> 5839.89s]  It's fine.
[5841.25s -> 5844.61s]  Okay, that's like a dog tunnel at one of those dog shows.
[5844.61s -> 5845.41s]  What's the point of this?
[5846.64s -> 5849.12s]  You just went through the obstacle.
[5849.12s -> 5851.12s]  That's an air duct for the air to travel through this.
[5851.12s -> 5851.84s]  You see?
[5851.84s -> 5852.96s]  Yeah, but why?
[5852.96s -> 5853.52s]  Why did you?
[5853.52s -> 5854.64s]  What's the point of having it here?
[5854.64s -> 5857.28s]  The air is not going to circulate unless you make this tube.
[5863.81s -> 5864.29s]  48.
[5865.01s -> 5868.30s]  All right, let's get to this metro station.
[5868.94s -> 5870.06s]  We lost it.
[5870.06s -> 5871.18s]  We lost the center.
[5872.88s -> 5873.84s]  I don't know what we're doing here.
[5875.74s -> 5877.42s]  We had a beep beep and we lost the scent.
[5878.14s -> 5879.50s]  Oh, there was a beep beep back there.
[5879.50s -> 5879.90s]  It was.
[5880.54s -> 5881.42s]  Do you want to go back?
[5881.42s -> 5882.30s]  We only have two minutes.
[5882.30s -> 5882.86s]  It's too late.
[5883.58s -> 5885.18s]  There's a whole bunch of shrooms down here.
[5885.18s -> 5886.86s]  Like every 10 steps, there's a shroom.
[5886.86s -> 5887.42s]  You want to go back?
[5888.30s -> 5891.10s]  No, I want to do the main quest objective.
[5891.10s -> 5891.82s]  Okay, fine.
[5891.82s -> 5892.94s]  I don't want to get distracted.
[5903.17s -> 5903.49s]  All right.
[5903.49s -> 5904.37s]  What was that?
[5904.37s -> 5906.37s]  That's the sound I make when I swing my two-hander.
[5908.21s -> 5909.17s]  I'm going to play chivalry.
[5914.27s -> 5915.39s]  There are shrooms everywhere.
[5915.39s -> 5915.79s]  You're right.
[5916.51s -> 5920.74s]  All right, let's hide from this guy.
[5923.54s -> 5923.94s]  Does he know?
[5925.30s -> 5925.54s]  What?
[5925.54s -> 5926.66s]  How does he know?
[5926.66s -> 5927.94s]  Oh, your head was sticking out.
[5928.90s -> 5937.36s]  We got to run.
[5937.36s -> 5938.32s]  Okay, just run forward.
[5939.12s -> 5946.21s]  Oh, he had vodka and decoys.
[5947.09s -> 5948.53s]  Decoys on that guy.
[5948.53s -> 5949.09s]  Let's go.
[5950.21s -> 5953.09s]  And cigarettes and yep.
[5953.09s -> 5953.73s]  Yeah, I could.
[5954.37s -> 5955.65s]  I got to the flare.
[5955.65s -> 5958.61s]  Look around the technical tunnel to the main station.
[5958.61s -> 5959.09s]  Stand here.
[5959.09s -> 5962.46s]  Well, finally a new whip.
[5962.46s -> 5963.18s]  I'll chat them up.
[5963.18s -> 5964.06s]  Will you get inside?
[5966.50s -> 5968.34s]  Ooh, what is the immunity?
[5968.34s -> 5969.78s]  And it's drinking.
[5970.90s -> 5971.78s]  You put a mask on.
[5972.34s -> 5975.07s]  I think I'm sitting in the light.
[5975.07s -> 5977.07s]  No, you put a mask on your character.
[5978.37s -> 5979.65s]  Did you?
[5979.65s -> 5980.74s]  Yeah.
[5980.74s -> 5981.62s]  Oh, cool.
[5981.62s -> 5983.15s]  That's really cool.
[5983.15s -> 5984.51s]  Yeah, I really like that.
[5986.30s -> 5987.26s]  Here, you're the door guy.
[5988.24s -> 5990.80s]  I mean, I'm a walk-pick guy, not the door guy.
[5990.80s -> 5992.00s]  Oh, can you hold the door for me?
[5993.44s -> 5993.84s]  Watch out.
[5993.84s -> 5994.56s]  We got a spitter.
[5995.84s -> 5996.32s]  Oh, my God.
[5996.32s -> 5998.40s]  This guy spitting fucking squad out of his nose.
[5998.40s -> 5999.76s]  Oh, it's coming out of his hat.
[6008.19s -> 6008.67s]  What do I do?
[6012.42s -> 6013.46s]  Okay, skip, skip, skip.
[6013.46s -> 6014.82s]  Run forward and hit it with a hammer.
[6014.82s -> 6015.06s]  Okay.
[6015.62s -> 6019.74s]  Well, it's a medium walk-pick.
[6019.74s -> 6020.06s]  I got it.
[6024.46s -> 6024.94s]  Hakon.
[6025.82s -> 6028.62s]  I'm telling you, I'm going to first try every single one of these.
[6028.62s -> 6029.34s]  It's open.
[6029.34s -> 6034.59s]  Kill that guy?
[6034.59s -> 6035.09s]  Yeah.
[6036.19s -> 6038.43s]  Killing him took less time than the phone call.
[6039.15s -> 6042.19s]  Did he have anything on him?
[6042.19s -> 6042.91s]  Trophy?
[6042.99s -> 6045.07s]  He had a special zombie-infected trophy.
[6045.07s -> 6048.35s]  He was like, congratulations on killing one of my rare species.
[6048.35s -> 6049.55s]  Here is an award.
[6050.19s -> 6053.66s]  No power.
[6057.02s -> 6057.74s]  Watch out.
[6062.46s -> 6063.90s]  Yeah, you're going to want to stay behind me for this.
[6068.14s -> 6070.78s]  Are you doing like a, I'm like a gremlin routine.
[6070.78s -> 6074.14s]  That's like the, I'm going to go down and I'm going to act like a gremlin
[6074.94s -> 6076.38s]  to make people laugh at the party.
[6078.46s -> 6080.78s]  How often do you play gremlin?
[6082.30s -> 6082.70s]  I don't know.
[6083.50s -> 6086.78s]  Have I ever seen somebody do the thing that I just referenced?
[6086.78s -> 6089.57s]  I don't think so.
[6092.38s -> 6093.66s]  I don't think I've seen that.
[6093.66s -> 6095.98s]  I don't think gremlin is a game a lot of kids play.
[6098.70s -> 6102.94s]  Why am I, why am I imagining a fake scenario where like somebody's drunk at a party and
[6102.94s -> 6106.06s]  they go on all fours and are like, I'm the gremlin and like I'm running around.
[6106.86s -> 6107.74s]  Yeah.
[6107.74s -> 6108.78s]  I feel like that's probably happened.
[6109.66s -> 6112.30s]  I mean, anything that can happen has happened.
[6113.10s -> 6121.66s]  And then they like jump into the pool.
[6121.66s -> 6122.22s]  You know what I mean?
[6122.22s -> 6123.58s]  Like, it's me, gremlin guy.
[6124.46s -> 6125.42s]  And then they jump in the pool.
[6126.14s -> 6128.53s]  I think you're thinking of your Sims playthrough again.
[6135.74s -> 6138.22s]  Oh, we're getting some golden coins.
[6138.22s -> 6144.96s]  So these kind of like hitman, you just throw them to distract people.
[6147.17s -> 6147.73s]  I guess.
[6148.61s -> 6153.18s]  Are you sure this is something you did yourself?
[6153.18s -> 6154.22s]  Hitman VR.
[6154.22s -> 6155.18s]  Should I play?
[6155.18s -> 6155.42s]  No.
[6156.54s -> 6156.94s]  Really?
[6156.94s -> 6158.62s]  I thought you would have been like, oh God, yes.
[6158.62s -> 6159.90s]  Yeah, it's okay.
[6160.46s -> 6162.06s]  Let me, let me explain hitman VR to you.
[6163.12s -> 6166.48s]  So IO interactive, phenomenal company.
[6166.48s -> 6169.20s]  Like seriously, like what, what a great, they,
[6169.28s -> 6170.32s]  what a story, right?
[6170.32s -> 6171.60s]  Oh, the IO verse.
[6171.60s -> 6173.36s]  They bought back their rights to their game.
[6173.36s -> 6175.28s]  They made fucking incredible hitman games.
[6175.28s -> 6177.60s]  One, two, and three, absolute like masterpieces of games.
[6177.60s -> 6178.32s]  It was so much fun.
[6179.04s -> 6183.20s]  They decided to make a PS VR version of hitman.
[6183.20s -> 6184.48s]  Oh, it was only PS VR?
[6184.48s -> 6185.92s]  It was PS VR exclusive.
[6186.64s -> 6189.52s]  And when, what they did is like a year later,
[6190.48s -> 6193.92s]  because you had to play with the controller in your hand with the VR headset on.
[6195.12s -> 6199.28s]  A year later, they decided to port the PS VR version
[6199.28s -> 6200.64s]  to like all the other headsets.
[6201.84s -> 6204.72s]  And it's really weird how it controls.
[6204.72s -> 6205.84s]  We just got Westworlded.
[6208.94s -> 6211.20s]  Okay, imagine they took the controller.
[6211.20s -> 6215.28s]  They cut the controller in half and you hold the PS4 controller in two hands.
[6215.84s -> 6216.80s]  It's kind of, it's weird.
[6218.24s -> 6219.36s]  Is it worth doing?
[6220.08s -> 6222.80s]  I think it's fun and it's hilarious the shit you can do.
[6222.80s -> 6223.44s]  Here's the choice.
[6223.44s -> 6225.12s]  I still haven't played Half-Life Alex.
[6225.12s -> 6226.16s]  Do I play it?
[6226.16s -> 6226.96s]  What are you doing?
[6228.80s -> 6231.76s]  Do not even make that, that's, you want me to make the choice for you?
[6232.40s -> 6233.44s]  Yeah, or Wii Sports.
[6234.86s -> 6236.62s]  You've never played Wii Sports?
[6236.62s -> 6237.66s]  Never played Wii Sports.
[6237.66s -> 6241.02s]  So like if either Half-Life Alex, Wii Sports, or Hitman VR.
[6241.02s -> 6243.10s]  Oh, fuck the Super Bowl is today.
[6243.10s -> 6243.82s]  It is.
[6243.82s -> 6245.02s]  Oh, well.
[6245.02s -> 6245.82s]  You gonna watch?
[6245.82s -> 6246.78s]  No.
[6246.78s -> 6248.77s]  I'm hoping the Packers win.
[6248.77s -> 6251.17s]  Half-Life Alex, Wii Sports, or Hitman VR.
[6251.17s -> 6254.93s]  I'd say Wii Sports because I mean, that's a legendary classic video game.
[6255.65s -> 6256.45s]  Okay, I don't have a Wii.
[6256.45s -> 6257.57s]  The tunnel is going to be closed.
[6257.57s -> 6258.69s]  Well, then play Half-Life Alex.
[6259.49s -> 6264.13s]  I feel like I've been hyping Alex up to you for like a year straight now,
[6264.13s -> 6265.81s]  and you're going to play it and be like, that sucked.
[6267.81s -> 6270.61s]  Someone was hyping it to me, not that like a week ago as well.
[6270.61s -> 6270.93s]  Let's get.
[6280.13s -> 6281.09s]  I can't even click.
[6281.09s -> 6282.05s]  You're doing it too fast.
[6287.81s -> 6289.01s]  You shouldn't trust me.
[6289.01s -> 6290.21s]  I'm on trust where I can try.
[6291.49s -> 6294.08s]  There are people here that are probably wanting to watch this,
[6294.56s -> 6297.44s]  to even get even a sniff of what the story is.
[6297.44s -> 6299.12s]  And we have to both apologize.
[6299.12s -> 6300.16s]  I can recap it.
[6300.16s -> 6301.68s]  I don't have to apologize.
[6301.68s -> 6303.60s]  If you apologize to your chat, you give them power.
[6304.96s -> 6308.22s]  My feet off of that.
[6308.78s -> 6310.62s]  But anyways, play Half-Life Alex.
[6311.90s -> 6314.46s]  There's a couple of sequences in Half-Life Alex that were just like,
[6314.46s -> 6316.06s]  wow, this is what VR is supposed to be.
[6316.78s -> 6322.45s]  Okay, wait, are we just leaving here?
[6322.45s -> 6323.33s]  I think so.
[6323.33s -> 6323.89s]  How is it?
[6324.61s -> 6325.49s]  Okay.
[6325.49s -> 6327.33s]  Oh, it's the enforcers.
[6327.33s -> 6328.21s]  Oh, shit.
[6328.21s -> 6329.81s]  Speaking of Half-Life Alex,
[6329.89s -> 6333.31s]  if this is Half-Life 2 opening scene right now.
[6333.31s -> 6335.49s]  Well, you forgot to go.
[6339.25s -> 6340.53s]  But can't we all agree that, like,
[6341.68s -> 6343.36s]  Red Faction 1 is better than Half-Life?
[6344.90s -> 6347.06s]  Okay, I don't think you're going to be, like,
[6347.06s -> 6348.74s]  allowed to be on the internet anymore after saying that.
[6350.10s -> 6351.62s]  I want to make it really clear.
[6351.62s -> 6353.54s]  I have nothing to do with this person.
[6353.54s -> 6355.06s]  I don't really know them that well.
[6355.06s -> 6355.78s]  I don't.
[6355.78s -> 6357.38s]  I have friends who kind of,
[6357.38s -> 6358.58s]  I don't really know them that well, though.
[6358.58s -> 6359.78s]  Have you played Red Faction?
[6360.80s -> 6361.60s]  Yes.
[6361.60s -> 6364.54s]  Okay.
[6364.54s -> 6365.74s]  Well, are you going to tell me
[6365.74s -> 6367.18s]  Red Faction is not a good game?
[6367.18s -> 6369.10s]  I mean, I don't remember playing.
[6369.10s -> 6370.22s]  It was a long time ago.
[6370.86s -> 6372.46s]  Okay, well, do it again.
[6374.46s -> 6376.22s]  Better than Half-Life 1 or Half-Life 2?
[6377.82s -> 6378.78s]  Better than Half-Life 2.
[6379.90s -> 6383.34s]  Because it's basically Half-Life 1 made two years later.
[6383.98s -> 6387.41s]  Well, everybody can have opinions,
[6387.41s -> 6389.49s]  and, you know, we can respect your opinion,
[6389.49s -> 6390.53s]  but disagree with you.
[6390.53s -> 6393.25s]  I don't think anyone's respecting my opinion.
[6393.25s -> 6394.61s]  We can disagree with that opinion.
[6394.61s -> 6395.49s]  We all have opinions.
[6395.49s -> 6397.09s]  We can, you know, just settle down.
[6397.09s -> 6399.25s]  I'm driving so much chat engagement.
[6400.93s -> 6403.28s]  Okay, we can either leave or explore.
[6403.28s -> 6404.56s]  Yeah, I want to.
[6405.28s -> 6406.46s]  We got janitors.
[6406.46s -> 6407.98s]  Like, oh, we're in the metro.
[6407.98s -> 6409.50s]  Wait, are we in the metro?
[6410.14s -> 6413.95s]  Are we in the metro?
[6413.95s -> 6415.63s]  I don't think there's much we can do here.
[6415.63s -> 6421.49s]  There's a door over there,
[6421.49s -> 6423.89s]  and then there's a door that has a quest marker on it over there.
[6424.69s -> 6425.17s]  Yeah, okay.
[6425.17s -> 6426.77s]  Let's go to the quest marker.
[6426.77s -> 6427.81s]  We're going to distract it.
[6427.81s -> 6428.53s]  I'm walking.
[6429.57s -> 6437.58s]  I will say that when I got to the boat section of Half-Life 2,
[6437.58s -> 6439.58s]  I almost threw up every time I tried to play it.
[6439.58s -> 6442.06s]  Okay, but did you ever throw up during playing Red Faction?
[6442.86s -> 6443.36s]  No.
[6448.35s -> 6450.03s]  I also have to be fair to the game as well.
[6450.03s -> 6452.59s]  That's back before anyone knew what FOV even was.
[6453.55s -> 6458.30s]  Back in like 2006, 2007, like FOV,
[6458.30s -> 6459.50s]  people didn't even fucking care.
[6459.50s -> 6460.38s]  Nobody even knew what it was.
[6462.03s -> 6463.79s]  That was like a gamer enthusiast,
[6463.79s -> 6466.19s]  like only a few people really even knew or cared about.
[6466.19s -> 6468.67s]  You're kind of reminded of like the olden days
[6468.67s -> 6472.35s]  where every single video TotalBiscuit had to explain what FPS was.
[6473.07s -> 6474.27s]  No, yeah, like I mean,
[6474.27s -> 6478.27s]  it was not like common knowledge back in like 2005, 2006.
[6478.27s -> 6482.91s]  Like FOV was something that nobody really even thought really thought that much about.
[6484.27s -> 6486.19s]  Yeah, the human eye can only see like 20.
[6486.99s -> 6487.63s]  All right, where are we going?
[6488.75s -> 6491.71s]  Yeah, so there's that slider in the video menu
[6491.71s -> 6494.75s]  that it starts at 75 and goes up to 90, right?
[6494.75s -> 6495.63s]  I never touched it.
[6495.63s -> 6498.11s]  So during the boat missions, it was 75 FOV,
[6498.11s -> 6501.15s]  and I'm sitting like a foot away, two feet away from my screen.
[6501.15s -> 6502.51s]  And I'm just like, why the fuck?
[6502.51s -> 6503.15s]  I'm sick.
[6503.71s -> 6506.51s]  Oh, I remember having to lie down on my back on the floor.
[6507.15s -> 6508.99s]  I was in the middle of the boat mission,
[6508.99s -> 6511.23s]  and I seriously had to get up, hit escape,
[6511.23s -> 6514.35s]  lie down on my back and lie there for like a minute or two.
[6515.15s -> 6516.75s]  But I really wanted to experience the game
[6516.75s -> 6518.91s]  so that I got up eventually after I was not nauseous
[6518.91s -> 6520.75s]  and did it again for like another five minutes.
[6521.39s -> 6522.75s]  Felt like I was going to puke again,
[6522.75s -> 6523.87s]  lied on my back on the ground.
[6524.67s -> 6527.15s]  I had to do that for like 40 minutes to get through that boat section.
[6528.78s -> 6530.78s]  Okay, but how do you feel about the hour-long,
[6530.78s -> 6532.54s]  non-skippable in-character cutscene?
[6533.84s -> 6535.36s]  That's like, but all right.
[6535.36s -> 6537.20s]  But they like pioneered that shit.
[6538.38s -> 6538.86s]  Back, okay.
[6538.86s -> 6540.94s]  Pioneered you having to like stand still?
[6540.94s -> 6543.10s]  You have to understand something, stir.
[6543.10s -> 6545.58s]  Weren't you saying earlier that you like games that let you go fast?
[6545.58s -> 6546.22s]  Yeah, but listen.
[6546.22s -> 6547.42s]  You were saying like, oh, I'm going fast.
[6547.98s -> 6550.78s]  Back before, before that,
[6550.78s -> 6554.78s]  it used to be you had like eight Final Fantasy CDs
[6554.78s -> 6556.38s]  because there were fucking four CDs
[6556.38s -> 6559.42s]  full of FMV full motion video rendered cutscenes on them.
[6560.22s -> 6562.62s]  Like when they came up with that idea
[6562.62s -> 6565.02s]  to not have like rendered cutscenes,
[6566.16s -> 6567.60s]  that was a huge deal.
[6567.60s -> 6568.64s]  Having it in the game,
[6568.64s -> 6571.44s]  it wasn't just like a cutscene that you had to watch.
[6571.44s -> 6573.68s]  But I think just because you can doesn't mean you should.
[6574.64s -> 6575.28s]  I'm stuck on this.
[6575.28s -> 6577.28s]  Hey, can you sell all your valuables?
[6577.28s -> 6580.80s]  I actually think I'm going to sell some stuff.
[6580.80s -> 6583.28s]  Yeah, the like cutscene that is not,
[6583.28s -> 6585.68s]  you know, there's no loading screen, go to the cutscene.
[6586.72s -> 6588.54s]  There's classes in this game.
[6588.54s -> 6590.14s]  These weapons actually look pretty good.
[6590.14s -> 6593.18s]  This guy's selling joggers for a brawler class.
[6593.18s -> 6595.49s]  I think I want this axe.
[6595.49s -> 6604.06s]  Is that a bad idea?
[6604.06s -> 6608.29s]  I just sold everything.
[6608.29s -> 6611.97s]  I think selling all the valuables are all like things that don't matter.
[6611.97s -> 6612.69s]  Okay, I hope so.
[6613.25s -> 6616.80s]  Holy shit, there's grenades.
[6620.05s -> 6624.75s]  Ooh, stamina cost.
[6624.75s -> 6625.79s]  Bracers for a tank.
[6628.11s -> 6629.23s]  When do I get the wingsuit?
[6633.52s -> 6635.28s]  I'm pretty sure there is one.
[6635.92s -> 6636.48s]  They might be.
[6636.48s -> 6637.44s]  Yeah, I'm assuming they might be.
[6637.44s -> 6638.32s]  All right, we should probably get.
[6639.63s -> 6642.11s]  I know that they have like the grappling hook again.
[6642.11s -> 6645.76s]  Now, can't you upgrade and like craft your gear?
[6645.76s -> 6647.81s]  I think so, right?
[6647.81s -> 6649.33s]  I'm going to buy a few of these.
[6649.89s -> 6651.33s]  Yeah, I'm buying a grenade.
[6651.33s -> 6654.91s]  Yeah, buy a couple of grenades.
[6654.91s -> 6656.27s]  I think we can utilize them pretty well.
[6658.86s -> 6662.08s]  We got the craft master over here.
[6662.08s -> 6663.12s]  Oh, you get blueprints.
[6663.12s -> 6666.88s]  There's mines and shock arrows for my arrow.
[6666.88s -> 6669.28s]  Where do you see blue mines?
[6670.75s -> 6671.71s]  The other merchant over here.
[6671.95s -> 6673.31s]  That was truly a pleasure.
[6674.32s -> 6675.84s]  Reinforces your weapon.
[6676.48s -> 6677.60s]  Is your voice higher today?
[6677.60s -> 6678.64s]  You sound like a balloon.
[6678.64s -> 6679.84s]  What are you talking about?
[6679.84s -> 6682.86s]  I sound like a balloon?
[6683.50s -> 6684.70s]  What do you mean a balloon?
[6685.26s -> 6687.02s]  Your voice is a little higher.
[6687.02s -> 6689.73s]  Your voice is a little bit higher.
[6689.73s -> 6692.24s]  What do you mean?
[6692.24s -> 6693.31s]  Hold on.
[6693.31s -> 6698.53s]  I don't have my effects thing on, do I?
[6698.53s -> 6701.17s]  Yeah, you've actually like the whole time you've been talking.
[6701.17s -> 6703.17s]  You've actually been talking like this.
[6703.17s -> 6706.22s]  It's been really weird and I didn't want.
[6706.22s -> 6707.66s]  I thought you were doing like a new thing.
[6707.66s -> 6708.62s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6708.62s -> 6712.00s]  How do I sound?
[6712.24s -> 6715.95s]  Should we both just do this and see what people say?
[6715.95s -> 6717.87s]  Just continue to stream the whole time.
[6717.87s -> 6719.95s]  A little bit higher.
[6719.95s -> 6722.03s]  And every hour that goes by, we get a little bit higher.
[6722.03s -> 6722.99s]  Just go a little bit higher.
[6722.99s -> 6724.83s]  A little bit higher.
[6724.83s -> 6726.67s]  And then when we get too high, we end the stream.
[6729.60s -> 6732.45s]  Okay, we have to have a base level though.
[6733.49s -> 6734.69s]  That's just high enough.
[6735.33s -> 6737.33s]  That's like one notch over.
[6737.33s -> 6739.97s]  Okay, so how do I sound with one notch over?
[6740.45s -> 6742.62s]  Is it kind of weird, but you can't really tell?
[6742.62s -> 6743.58s]  Are you doing it now?
[6743.58s -> 6744.88s]  I'm doing it right now.
[6744.88s -> 6746.08s]  I can't tell at all.
[6746.08s -> 6747.92s]  I think I got used to it.
[6747.92s -> 6749.95s]  What about this one?
[6749.95s -> 6750.67s]  I can't tell.
[6750.67s -> 6751.94s]  What about now?
[6751.94s -> 6754.05s]  Is it different?
[6754.05s -> 6755.01s]  Very slightly.
[6755.01s -> 6756.13s]  I think I heard there.
[6756.13s -> 6757.09s]  Okay, so how about now?
[6759.15s -> 6760.19s]  Is it too noticeable now?
[6760.83s -> 6762.03s]  Extremely noticeable.
[6762.03s -> 6762.59s]  All right.
[6762.59s -> 6763.23s]  How about now?
[6767.63s -> 6771.39s]  That sounds like something might be wrong with your mic, but like kind of normal.
[6771.39s -> 6773.23s]  All right, now you do one notch on pitch.
[6773.23s -> 6775.60s]  We both have the same product.
[6775.60s -> 6777.04s]  Are you doing gender or pitch?
[6777.04s -> 6780.10s]  I did pitch.
[6780.10s -> 6782.50s]  Okay, that's one notch gender.
[6782.50s -> 6785.26s]  Okay, I don't hear anything.
[6785.26s -> 6785.90s]  Two.
[6785.90s -> 6787.66s]  Oh, you can start to hear it.
[6787.66s -> 6789.82s]  It just sounds like something wrong with your mic.
[6789.82s -> 6791.74s]  Yeah, and then you go a little.
[6791.74s -> 6792.62s]  Yeah, this one.
[6792.62s -> 6794.86s]  Okay, this one I have to go pretty far and then it's weird.
[6794.86s -> 6795.74s]  Is that pitch or gender?
[6795.74s -> 6796.24s]  Which one?
[6797.04s -> 6798.16s]  I'm doing pitch now.
[6798.16s -> 6799.44s]  This is one notch.
[6799.44s -> 6801.52s]  Okay, yeah, this is just one notch and I can kind of hear it.
[6801.52s -> 6802.48s]  Yeah, okay.
[6802.48s -> 6803.60s]  I'm on one notch as well.
[6803.60s -> 6804.24s]  All right, let's go.
[6805.36s -> 6805.86s]  Okay.
[6807.12s -> 6808.64s]  This is so weird.
[6808.64s -> 6809.92s]  It is really weird.
[6809.92s -> 6815.23s]  Once we get to a certain point though, then we're gonna, you know, we gotta go.
[6815.31s -> 6821.70s]  I am gonna upgrade my consumable.
[6821.70s -> 6824.42s]  Yeah, you can get like shock tips for your weapon here.
[6824.42s -> 6827.95s]  You can get, you know, we can get some crafts for our,
[6827.95s -> 6829.55s]  you gotta buy those so you can upgrade your weapon.
[6829.55s -> 6830.75s]  It's not like a different recursive.
[6830.75s -> 6831.25s]  Okay.
[6832.02s -> 6834.10s]  Yeah.
[6834.10s -> 6835.46s]  All right, I think I got what I need.
[6835.46s -> 6838.24s]  I'm gonna buy a couple.
[6838.24s -> 6840.40s]  What's this?
[6840.40s -> 6841.52s]  I have a lot of heals.
[6841.52s -> 6842.32s]  I got eight heals.
[6842.32s -> 6843.12s]  I think we're good.
[6843.12s -> 6846.10s]  All right.
[6846.88s -> 6847.68s]  You went up higher.
[6848.32s -> 6849.20s]  I didn't go up higher.
[6849.20s -> 6849.84s]  Yes, you did.
[6849.84s -> 6851.04s]  You went up higher.
[6851.04s -> 6852.48s]  I just started talking a little bit different.
[6852.48s -> 6853.60s]  No, you went up higher.
[6853.60s -> 6854.08s]  You went like this.
[6854.08s -> 6854.96s]  I didn't go up higher.
[6854.96s -> 6856.32s]  This is what you just did.
[6856.32s -> 6857.60s]  What are you talking about?
[6857.60s -> 6858.40s]  You just went higher.
[6859.12s -> 6861.28s]  I was just talking different.
[6861.28s -> 6863.12s]  I didn't change the slider.
[6863.12s -> 6863.76s]  Yes, you just did.
[6863.76s -> 6864.24s]  I heard it.
[6865.14s -> 6866.42s]  What do you mean you heard it?
[6867.22s -> 6867.78s]  Do Aaron.
[6870.61s -> 6870.77s]  Aaron!
[6870.77s -> 6871.73s]  What are you talking about?
[6871.73s -> 6873.25s]  Can I get an Aaron from you?
[6874.48s -> 6875.20s]  Aaron?
[6875.20s -> 6875.70s]  No.
[6876.75s -> 6877.25s]  There you go.
[6880.42s -> 6880.82s]  All right.
[6880.82s -> 6882.42s]  Let's fucking play the game, please.
[6883.06s -> 6884.18s]  Let's play the game.
[6887.20s -> 6889.20s]  No, that's that's like chipmunk.
[6889.20s -> 6890.40s]  You know, it's not.
[6890.48s -> 6890.98s]  It's...
[6892.00s -> 6892.50s]  It's like...
[6893.87s -> 6894.37s]  Not like...
[6907.66s -> 6909.02s]  Oh, so you like you suck.
[6909.58s -> 6910.08s]  You suck.
[6911.34s -> 6912.06s]  You suck.
[6912.06s -> 6912.62s]  Why you say it?
[6913.42s -> 6914.94s]  You just lost us like 3,000 viewers.
[6914.94s -> 6915.34s]  Thanks a lot.
[6915.34s -> 6915.84s]  Let's go.
[6917.66s -> 6918.16s]  Okay.
[6919.42s -> 6921.50s]  You're the one that like started this whole thing.
[6921.50s -> 6921.82s]  Thanks.
[6921.82s -> 6922.38s]  Thanks a lot.
[6922.38s -> 6922.70s]  Thanks a lot.
[6922.70s -> 6923.90s]  You lost us like 3k viewers.
[6923.90s -> 6924.40s]  Thank you.
[6925.04s -> 6925.54s]  Okay.
[6925.92s -> 6926.80s]  Yeah, I'm at negative.
[6928.24s -> 6932.26s]  Wait, wait.
[6932.26s -> 6933.22s]  I wanted to ask what they...
[6933.22s -> 6934.42s]  What did they want from me?
[6934.42s -> 6935.38s]  They asked me to help them.
[6935.38s -> 6936.82s]  He might let me through to the center.
[6937.38s -> 6937.86s]  If I...
[6937.86s -> 6938.50s]  Okay, we're caught up.
[6938.50s -> 6940.18s]  Completely unwatchable stream.
[6945.36s -> 6946.66s]  Fuck you, dude.
[6946.66s -> 6946.90s]  All right.
[6946.90s -> 6948.50s]  Find the brass knuckle thief.
[6948.50s -> 6951.14s]  Find Hubert Kerbapsos.
[6951.86s -> 6954.36s]  Let's find him.
[6955.40s -> 6957.76s]  Oh, so you went the wrong way.
[6957.76s -> 6962.34s]  Pretty sure Hubert Kerbapsos...
[6962.34s -> 6963.94s]  I'm sorry that I said you sound like a balloon
[6963.94s -> 6965.22s]  and made you lose a thousand viewers.
[6966.02s -> 6968.10s]  Well, time that person off for five minutes.
[6970.95s -> 6972.71s]  How dare you do that to our stream?
[6973.51s -> 6975.19s]  I take my stream very...
[6976.07s -> 6976.63s]  Seriously?
[6978.88s -> 6980.24s]  I still haven't figured this out.
[6980.24s -> 6981.44s]  I still haven't figured out how to climb.
[6981.44s -> 6982.40s]  Oh, this guy's got a book.
[6983.20s -> 6985.86s]  I still for some reason have not figured this out.
[6986.66s -> 6986.90s]  What?
[6987.46s -> 6988.98s]  Like how to like properly like climb
[6988.98s -> 6990.18s]  without losing all your stamina.
[6990.98s -> 6992.58s]  Oh, you just climb up.
[6992.58s -> 6993.62s]  I think the more you press...
[6993.62s -> 6995.62s]  Like if you mash spacebar, it's just like...
[6995.62s -> 6997.22s]  Oh, it's just drain...
[6997.22s -> 6997.54s]  Okay.
[6997.54s -> 6999.14s]  It sucks it out of you.
[6999.14s -> 6999.30s]  Yeah.
[6999.30s -> 7000.50s]  What is this book going on here?
[7000.50s -> 7000.90s]  I don't know.
[7000.90s -> 7001.94s]  I was by the campfire.
[7002.74s -> 7007.89s]  Is this Life is Strange?
[7011.99s -> 7013.75s]  I know you're cycling through your secondary
[7013.75s -> 7014.55s]  to see if you have a grenade.
[7015.89s -> 7016.37s]  I'm not.
[7016.37s -> 7016.93s]  I'm sitting down.
[7016.93s -> 7017.65s]  I can't do anything.
[7017.65s -> 7018.37s]  That's what I was doing.
[7019.09s -> 7019.49s]  Oh, no.
[7019.49s -> 7021.49s]  I'm sitting down and just taking in the environment.
[7022.53s -> 7024.42s]  Did it do anything?
[7024.42s -> 7025.62s]  No, there's like right here.
[7025.62s -> 7027.84s]  There's actually like a sit spot.
[7027.84s -> 7028.24s]  Oh, no.
[7028.24s -> 7029.04s]  I see what's going on.
[7029.68s -> 7032.16s]  All these guys got to the boat level in Half-Life 2.
[7032.16s -> 7032.56s]  I see.
[7032.56s -> 7032.96s]  I get it.
[7033.94s -> 7034.90s]  I mean, I have a grenade.
[7040.42s -> 7040.74s]  Yeah.
[7040.74s -> 7041.46s]  Life is Strange.
[7041.46s -> 7041.86s]  Let's go.
[7042.42s -> 7046.31s]  Just kind of chill and vibe out.
[7046.31s -> 7048.16s]  So tough being a teen.
[7049.40s -> 7049.80s]  All right.
[7049.80s -> 7050.36s]  Are you ready?
[7053.08s -> 7053.32s]  Yeah.
[7054.47s -> 7055.35s]  Is it...
[7055.35s -> 7055.91s]  Okay.
[7055.91s -> 7056.63s]  He almost...
[7056.63s -> 7056.87s]  Okay.
[7056.87s -> 7057.35s]  He almost...
[7057.35s -> 7058.31s]  I thought he was going to throw a grenade.
[7059.67s -> 7059.99s]  Yeah.
[7059.99s -> 7061.27s]  I thought he was going to throw a grenade at them.
[7063.88s -> 7064.12s]  All right.
[7064.12s -> 7064.36s]  Come on.
[7064.36s -> 7064.84s]  Let's go.
[7064.84s -> 7065.48s]  Sarah, stop.
[7065.48s -> 7066.76s]  I didn't even see it.
[7066.76s -> 7067.72s]  I didn't even look.
[7067.72s -> 7068.20s]  I didn't...
[7068.20s -> 7068.76s]  I thought that...
[7068.76s -> 7069.00s]  Okay.
[7069.00s -> 7070.12s]  I didn't even look.
[7071.72s -> 7073.16s]  I didn't even get it on camera.
[7074.04s -> 7076.56s]  Okay.
[7079.88s -> 7080.84s]  No, nothing.
[7081.72s -> 7083.03s]  Scraps.
[7083.03s -> 7084.87s]  I killed her for a box of scraps.
[7086.07s -> 7086.79s]  Oh, scraps?
[7088.26s -> 7090.58s]  Unlock faction structures and activate a safe zone.
[7092.87s -> 7093.03s]  Yeah.
[7093.03s -> 7093.83s]  I have no more grenades.
[7101.24s -> 7103.46s]  Let's just go do this.
[7103.46s -> 7103.70s]  Wait.
[7103.70s -> 7104.42s]  There's something going on here.
[7106.29s -> 7106.69s]  Bandit.
[7107.33s -> 7108.69s]  Oh, they're bandits?
[7108.69s -> 7109.01s]  Bandit.
[7110.55s -> 7111.35s]  That's not...
[7111.35s -> 7111.67s]  Okay.
[7111.67s -> 7112.47s]  They need to fix that.
[7112.47s -> 7113.59s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[7113.59s -> 7115.19s]  I'm sending an air support.
[7115.19s -> 7116.23s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[7116.23s -> 7117.99s]  Like, how would that even make any sense?
[7117.99s -> 7119.03s]  I can't even climb that.
[7120.07s -> 7122.53s]  There's an explosion.
[7123.25s -> 7125.70s]  He's going to get away.
[7125.70s -> 7127.38s]  Wait, there was...
[7127.38s -> 7129.54s]  Oh, that's what you meant by bandit.
[7130.26s -> 7130.74s]  Band-aid.
[7130.74s -> 7131.30s]  Bandit.
[7132.10s -> 7132.74s]  Oh.
[7132.74s -> 7133.38s]  We got to...
[7133.38s -> 7134.90s]  Can we go to the quest?
[7134.90s -> 7136.98s]  I want to earn like a new parkour skill.
[7138.98s -> 7139.30s]  Fine.
[7141.41s -> 7141.97s]  It's up here.
[7141.97s -> 7142.85s]  It's like straight up.
[7143.49s -> 7144.05s]  Oh, my God.
[7144.05s -> 7144.29s]  It is.
[7144.85s -> 7152.55s]  How did you get on top of that?
[7153.19s -> 7157.19s]  I lined it with my arm.
[7159.88s -> 7161.88s]  Explain how microwaves work to Jerma.
[7163.64s -> 7165.24s]  Literally, who knows how they work?
[7165.24s -> 7167.00s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7167.00s -> 7168.20s]  I have a question for you.
[7168.20s -> 7170.36s]  Don't listen to any of these jokers.
[7170.36s -> 7171.88s]  Any of these idiots.
[7172.60s -> 7173.08s]  Listen to me.
[7173.80s -> 7175.24s]  These morons, okay?
[7175.24s -> 7176.28s]  I have to make it very clear.
[7176.28s -> 7177.48s]  We got to get a baseline here.
[7178.44s -> 7180.52s]  So, when you microwave food...
[7181.32s -> 7182.68s]  I don't own a microwave.
[7182.68s -> 7184.76s]  You don't own a microwave.
[7184.76s -> 7186.13s]  I don't.
[7186.13s -> 7187.57s]  Why do you not own a microwave?
[7188.37s -> 7191.41s]  Because Gordon Ramsey would be really disappointed in me if I did.
[7191.41s -> 7192.53s]  So you have a microwave, fine.
[7192.53s -> 7193.89s]  When you can put something in the oven,
[7194.69s -> 7196.45s]  why not put it in the oven?
[7196.45s -> 7197.89s]  It takes like two hours.
[7197.89s -> 7198.77s]  It takes like an hour.
[7199.57s -> 7200.95s]  How do we climb?
[7200.95s -> 7202.15s]  What the fuck is going on?
[7202.15s -> 7202.65s]  Oh.
[7203.59s -> 7206.15s]  The Sonic and the Hedgehog shit is going on right now.
[7206.15s -> 7207.14s]  Okay.
[7207.14s -> 7209.06s]  Well, anyways, you've used a microphone.
[7213.56s -> 7215.24s]  Yeah, I've used my microphone a little bit.
[7215.24s -> 7217.24s]  So when you use your microwave oven,
[7219.33s -> 7220.13s]  when you do that...
[7221.17s -> 7222.37s]  Yeah, I do that.
[7222.37s -> 7222.87s]  Yes.
[7223.33s -> 7223.89s]  When you...
[7223.89s -> 7224.53s]  Okay, you put it in...
[7224.53s -> 7225.65s]  Let's say you put it in like popcorn.
[7225.65s -> 7226.13s]  It doesn't matter.
[7226.13s -> 7227.41s]  Someone's sneaking up on me.
[7227.41s -> 7228.93s]  Oh, it's behind you.
[7229.49s -> 7230.85s]  Okay, let's just theoretically say
[7230.85s -> 7233.33s]  that I'm making my own popcorn in my microwave that I own.
[7233.33s -> 7233.97s]  Sure.
[7233.97s -> 7234.47s]  You put it...
[7237.17s -> 7238.13s]  And it goes for like a minute.
[7238.77s -> 7239.17s]  Yeah.
[7239.17s -> 7239.65s]  And you hear...
[7240.53s -> 7241.01s]  Right.
[7241.01s -> 7242.13s]  When it gets to zero,
[7243.80s -> 7244.36s]  and you open it,
[7245.40s -> 7246.52s]  does that like...
[7246.52s -> 7249.32s]  Would you put like putting your hand in there like right when it hits zero?
[7250.13s -> 7250.53s]  Don't you...
[7250.53s -> 7251.73s]  Isn't it like kind of weird?
[7251.73s -> 7252.29s]  Like that...
[7253.40s -> 7254.84s]  Isn't that like an odd thing?
[7254.84s -> 7256.60s]  That like there was just radiation in there.
[7257.24s -> 7257.88s]  Zero, open.
[7257.88s -> 7259.24s]  Oh, that's my popcorn.
[7259.24s -> 7260.44s]  Like isn't that kind of weird?
[7261.08s -> 7262.20s]  I've never thought about it,
[7262.20s -> 7263.00s]  but you know what?
[7263.00s -> 7263.88s]  That is kind of weird.
[7264.60s -> 7265.64s]  Like really think about that,
[7265.64s -> 7266.28s]  but just a second.
[7267.99s -> 7271.75s]  Like the fact that like they may be like residual waves in there.
[7271.75s -> 7272.47s]  Does it just go away?
[7274.58s -> 7279.00s]  I mean, I'm pretty sure if the microwave was on,
[7279.00s -> 7282.20s]  your hand could be in it for like a second before like you would even...
[7282.76s -> 7284.04s]  Microwaves are not radiation.
[7284.04s -> 7286.20s]  Yeah, but it's like radio waves.
[7287.08s -> 7292.42s]  That's not how it works.
[7293.14s -> 7293.94s]  Kids these days,
[7293.94s -> 7295.62s]  they just grow up trusting technology
[7295.62s -> 7296.74s]  because they didn't live through that.
[7297.46s -> 7298.82s]  Like all the stuff that we did.
[7299.62s -> 7300.18s]  I'm just telling you.
[7300.18s -> 7302.82s]  The radio with the announcement of the aliens.
[7302.82s -> 7303.22s]  What was that?
[7303.22s -> 7304.02s]  The war of the world.
[7304.90s -> 7307.20s]  They like they didn't have that.
[7307.20s -> 7310.47s]  They just trust stuff and we know to like
[7310.47s -> 7312.79s]  to filter through and find what's real.
[7312.79s -> 7313.11s]  All right.
[7313.11s -> 7313.91s]  Hear the news.
[7313.91s -> 7317.59s]  Because most news these days is fake, honestly.
[7317.59s -> 7318.55s]  And okay.
[7318.55s -> 7320.79s]  Is it weird that there's a concept of the...
[7320.79s -> 7322.95s]  Is the microwave a weird appliance?
[7322.95s -> 7324.23s]  I want to buy something.
[7324.31s -> 7326.07s]  The fridge is like a fridge.
[7326.07s -> 7328.16s]  It is cold in here.
[7328.16s -> 7332.16s]  An oven heats up with gas and heat, right?
[7332.80s -> 7337.28s]  A microwave like zaps with fucking microwave radio waves
[7337.28s -> 7339.04s]  your food until it's like nuclear.
[7340.24s -> 7341.04s]  It's kind of weird.
[7341.04s -> 7342.08s]  It's kind of a weird appliance.
[7344.20s -> 7345.16s]  That's why I don't own one.
[7345.16s -> 7346.68s]  And you were judging me for not having one.
[7347.32s -> 7350.72s]  We got to go all the way to the top
[7350.72s -> 7351.68s]  and then you're going to jump off.
[7351.68s -> 7352.64s]  And I'm going to laugh at it.
[7355.22s -> 7356.66s]  That's the end of the conversation.
[7357.06s -> 7358.26s]  He's running away.
[7358.26s -> 7359.38s]  Wait, who's running away?
[7363.38s -> 7366.34s]  We have one minute and 15 seconds to go this way.
[7368.16s -> 7368.96s]  So we got to go up.
[7368.96s -> 7369.84s]  Where did you go?
[7369.84s -> 7370.64s]  We're going up.
[7385.33s -> 7387.25s]  It was a timer in front of me.
[7387.25s -> 7390.77s]  It said one minute 15 on a marker all the way across the map.
[7392.37s -> 7393.17s]  Oh, there is.
[7393.17s -> 7393.49s]  What?
[7393.49s -> 7394.13s]  Wait, what?
[7394.13s -> 7395.57s]  I'm not crazy, right?
[7395.57s -> 7396.53s]  Am I crazy?
[7396.53s -> 7398.45s]  There's a red circle pointing me up here.
[7400.08s -> 7401.36s]  All players require.
[7401.36s -> 7403.84s]  What are you going to come help me?
[7403.84s -> 7407.68s]  How do you think your Wi-Fi router works?
[7408.32s -> 7408.96s]  I don't know.
[7408.96s -> 7410.16s]  That's fucking weird, too.
[7410.88s -> 7412.95s]  You know, that's weird.
[7412.95s -> 7414.95s]  We can communicate like with nothing.
[7415.43s -> 7416.15s]  No wires.
[7416.15s -> 7417.27s]  Dude just fell off.
[7417.27s -> 7417.99s]  What are you doing?
[7419.03s -> 7420.07s]  Where am I?
[7420.07s -> 7422.31s]  Why am I on the top of a construction site?
[7426.98s -> 7428.18s]  I fast traveled you.
[7430.34s -> 7432.50s]  I didn't realize I got 10 seconds to.
[7437.70s -> 7438.34s]  OK, anyways.
[7439.22s -> 7440.02s]  Yeah, we felt that.
[7440.92s -> 7443.08s]  Anyways, we got to pull back a little.
[7444.87s -> 7449.51s]  I'm not saying that there's something wrong with like radio waves.
[7449.51s -> 7453.19s]  I'm not saying that like your phone and wireless signals are weird.
[7453.19s -> 7456.71s]  I'm just saying it's kind of odd like that we have this technology,
[7456.71s -> 7460.47s]  but we can be able to do stuff without wires and cords and stuff.
[7460.47s -> 7461.43s]  He's running away.
[7461.43s -> 7462.15s]  OK, we got to go.
[7463.35s -> 7463.51s]  All right.
[7463.51s -> 7464.63s]  So how do we get down safely?
[7465.27s -> 7466.87s]  I see you.
[7466.87s -> 7469.19s]  What you're saying is you also similar to me,
[7469.19s -> 7471.43s]  this man of culture do not trust 5G.
[7474.04s -> 7475.24s]  No, I don't look.
[7476.20s -> 7477.16s]  You want to have this conversation?
[7478.24s -> 7478.72s]  Here we go.
[7481.70s -> 7482.66s]  When is it going to be enough?
[7485.92s -> 7487.12s]  How many when is it?
[7487.12s -> 7490.16s]  When is it going to be enough for you to sit on the toilet and go on Twitter?
[7490.16s -> 7491.44s]  How many G's do we need?
[7491.44s -> 7492.24s]  When is it going to be enough?
[7493.32s -> 7495.24s]  Are you saying like we already have enough G's?
[7496.76s -> 7497.72s]  Do we need like 8G?
[7498.52s -> 7501.57s]  I mean, has your phone ever disconnected before
[7501.57s -> 7503.41s]  and you were like, oh, I don't think I can go on living.
[7509.67s -> 7510.31s]  10G.
[7511.11s -> 7513.67s]  What is a G?
[7514.47s -> 7517.49s]  It's a gigabit band of wireless information.
[7518.13s -> 7520.52s]  Just said a few words that I thought sounded good.
[7522.74s -> 7526.95s]  Am I there?
[7527.75s -> 7528.31s]  He's not here.
[7530.39s -> 7531.59s]  Why do we still have 14 seconds?
[7541.40s -> 7541.96s]  Climbing up this?
[7543.20s -> 7544.00s]  We failed the mission.
[7544.56s -> 7546.32s]  No, I got here, but you climbed up this.
[7546.32s -> 7547.04s]  We got to climb this.
[7554.85s -> 7555.33s]  Hey, man.
[7556.21s -> 7558.53s]  Yeah, we got to climb up this.
[7559.25s -> 7560.53s]  How are we supposed to do that?
[7568.23s -> 7569.75s]  Fucking grab something.
[7572.44s -> 7573.56s]  You're like, oh my.
[7573.56s -> 7573.80s]  Okay.
[7574.84s -> 7576.50s]  I thought you were going to fall through.
[7577.88s -> 7578.84s]  That looks so funny.
[7582.28s -> 7582.68s]  Nice.
[7582.68s -> 7583.08s]  Good job.
[7583.72s -> 7585.96s]  Okay, we got to climb.
[7586.92s -> 7589.40s]  I'm not like anti 5G.
[7589.40s -> 7591.96s]  I'm just saying it's crazy that we have this technology.
[7591.96s -> 7593.64s]  Who gave the aliens gave it to us?
[7593.64s -> 7594.76s]  All right, I'm going to fall on.
[7594.76s -> 7595.80s]  You want to hear what I really think?
[7596.96s -> 7597.36s]  I do.
[7603.80s -> 7605.08s]  Wow, they silenced you that quick.
[7608.07s -> 7609.59s]  Like in real time.
[7609.59s -> 7614.45s]  I was going to hold that longer,
[7614.45s -> 7615.17s]  but I feel like that would hurt.
[7615.17s -> 7616.37s]  It was really loud.
[7616.37s -> 7616.93s]  Was it loud?
[7617.57s -> 7617.97s]  It was.
[7617.97s -> 7618.29s]  Yeah.
[7618.29s -> 7618.85s]  Oh my God.
[7618.85s -> 7619.65s]  It wasn't supposed to be.
[7620.37s -> 7625.40s]  Well, you know, I'm dying now.
[7625.40s -> 7626.60s]  Is this guy's name Tuber?
[7628.13s -> 7629.41s]  It's Hubert.
[7629.41s -> 7630.05s]  Oh, I just heard.
[7630.05s -> 7630.61s]  Hey, Tuber.
[7631.25s -> 7640.69s]  That's a restricted area.
[7642.82s -> 7643.46s]  Yeah, watch out.
[7644.42s -> 7644.74s]  That's it.
[7645.38s -> 7647.62s]  Will you get a glue onto something?
[7648.18s -> 7648.90s]  Oh, it's this way.
[7657.48s -> 7658.04s]  Wait, where?
[7658.04s -> 7658.76s]  Where?
[7658.76s -> 7660.39s]  When you get close.
[7660.39s -> 7661.99s]  I think it's just we just find him, right?
[7662.71s -> 7663.83s]  There's a door here.
[7663.83s -> 7664.47s]  He's right here.
[7665.19s -> 7665.99s]  You fucking.
[7665.99s -> 7666.55s]  Is this you?
[7668.23s -> 7669.35s]  Is this you Tuber?
[7669.35s -> 7669.99s]  Is this Tuber?
[7670.71s -> 7671.88s]  What are you doing, Tuber?
[7674.04s -> 7674.44s]  I don't know.
[7676.20s -> 7678.82s]  Why'd you run away then?
[7678.82s -> 7681.22s]  Is it the light has a higher frequency than microwaves?
[7682.18s -> 7683.62s]  I know I look.
[7683.62s -> 7685.30s]  I don't have a problem with microwave ovens.
[7685.30s -> 7687.06s]  I'm just saying I like they kind of scare me a little.
[7688.07s -> 7689.27s]  You know what scares me?
[7689.27s -> 7692.31s]  And people always make fun of me for but magnets.
[7693.89s -> 7698.29s]  I'm terrified of putting a magnet like anywhere near my computer.
[7698.29s -> 7699.65s]  So I don't want any magnet.
[7702.24s -> 7704.24s]  They have like metal cases for your computer.
[7704.24s -> 7706.64s]  And it's like, oh, you could put like it was like magnet for your course.
[7706.64s -> 7708.08s]  They're like magnet on your computer.
[7708.08s -> 7708.64s]  I'm like, isn't it?
[7709.60s -> 7712.08s]  You put a magnet to a TV like what happened with that?
[7712.08s -> 7713.12s]  Shit went south.
[7713.12s -> 7715.12s]  Yeah, everyone's saying fair, fair.
[7715.12s -> 7716.40s]  You're afraid of magnets.
[7716.40s -> 7720.56s]  Okay, and I and I like don't like microwaves kind of freak me out.
[7720.56s -> 7722.08s]  But like you're afraid of magnets.
[7722.08s -> 7724.64s]  But people are saying true, fair, fair.
[7724.64s -> 7725.52s]  That's true, true, true.
[7726.66s -> 7728.90s]  I don't like because, okay, we were at PAX East once.
[7728.90s -> 7730.26s]  And this guy was like, hey, promoting my game.
[7730.26s -> 7731.78s]  I think it was like Starbound or something like that.
[7731.78s -> 7733.54s]  He's like, here we got like magnets for it.
[7733.54s -> 7735.86s]  And I was like, dude, I don't want your fucking gamer magnet.
[7735.86s -> 7736.98s]  I want that anywhere near my computer.
[7736.98s -> 7741.44s]  And he was like really weirded out.
[7741.44s -> 7743.28s]  I don't want that near my computer.
[7743.84s -> 7745.68s]  Yeah, I can't believe you're getting trued.
[7746.16s -> 7749.81s]  Okay, this is you're getting true, true.
[7749.81s -> 7750.45s]  Oh, yeah, true.
[7750.45s -> 7751.89s]  Well, like I'm not afraid.
[7751.89s -> 7754.13s]  My computer is accidentally going to go in a microwave.
[7755.25s -> 7760.69s]  I think they're both valid opinions to have.
[7761.25s -> 7762.21s]  Even though you're okay.
[7762.77s -> 7763.89s]  You're not afraid of magnets.
[7763.89s -> 7768.69s]  You just don't want them near your computer or my head.
[7768.69s -> 7769.01s]  Yes.
[7769.01s -> 7769.57s]  Or your head.
[7769.57s -> 7771.17s]  Like, okay, mess with your brain waves.
[7771.17s -> 7774.77s]  If you were to take a magnet and put it and put it next to your head,
[7774.77s -> 7775.41s]  would you do that?
[7779.91s -> 7782.15s]  I have to figure out what your level of fear is.
[7782.71s -> 7783.35s]  You know what?
[7783.35s -> 7784.63s]  I don't think I would.
[7784.63s -> 7786.15s]  This sounds really weird.
[7786.15s -> 7788.55s]  Like, if it was a really strong magnet and you were just like,
[7788.55s -> 7789.59s]  you put this near your head.
[7789.59s -> 7791.83s]  Like, sometimes I sit on my phone and I'm like,
[7791.83s -> 7793.43s]  are my balls being cooked right now?
[7793.43s -> 7795.11s]  Like, I don't legitimately think they are,
[7795.11s -> 7798.58s]  but it kind of makes you think like, why take the risk?
[7798.58s -> 7802.60s]  Okay, so yeah, so you don't really like them.
[7802.60s -> 7805.16s]  You don't really, you're not like, you know, you know, you don't,
[7805.16s -> 7805.80s]  you know, they work.
[7805.80s -> 7806.44s]  You know what they do.
[7806.92s -> 7810.28s]  But you don't make fan like of having them around, right?
[7810.84s -> 7813.72s]  Yeah, I figured like, why bother with magnets?
[7814.96s -> 7816.72s]  I feel like we don't need magnets.
[7817.44s -> 7819.36s]  There are detriments to magnets.
[7820.08s -> 7821.84s]  Okay, the, the, the true people,
[7821.84s -> 7823.92s]  the people that were saying true are have you've lost them.
[7823.92s -> 7828.00s]  So I'm good at losing them.
[7831.27s -> 7833.27s]  Chad, anyone who's watching this stream right now,
[7833.27s -> 7835.59s]  take your cellular, your cellular device.
[7835.59s -> 7836.15s]  Let me make it.
[7836.15s -> 7837.03s]  Don't do anything.
[7837.03s -> 7837.67s]  He said on it.
[7837.67s -> 7838.31s]  Don't do anything.
[7838.31s -> 7839.27s]  He says, don't do anything.
[7839.27s -> 7839.67s]  He ever said.
[7839.67s -> 7842.23s]  Place it right underneath your crotch and just sit on your phone.
[7842.23s -> 7842.87s]  Don't do anything.
[7842.87s -> 7843.51s]  He ever says.
[7843.51s -> 7844.87s]  This is a big disclaimer.
[7844.87s -> 7846.79s]  This is the, I do not condone anything he tells you to do.
[7850.48s -> 7851.20s]  We need to go down.
[7851.20s -> 7855.41s]  There's a, I want to jump.
[7855.41s -> 7857.09s]  I'm not afraid of microwaves.
[7857.09s -> 7858.85s]  I just, they, they, they're a little weird.
[7858.85s -> 7859.33s]  That's it.
[7859.33s -> 7860.29s]  That's the only argument.
[7861.49s -> 7872.32s]  Oh, I, I have to get down there too, man.
[7873.20s -> 7874.08s]  How am I going to do that?
[7874.98s -> 7875.78s]  Climb.
[7875.78s -> 7881.83s]  Holy shit.
[7881.83s -> 7882.95s]  Okay, we're good.
[7882.95s -> 7888.13s]  Help me.
[7888.13s -> 7889.09s]  Why would it be R?
[7889.89s -> 7893.25s]  I really thought you'd let me die.
[7894.58s -> 7903.32s]  Okay.
[7903.32s -> 7904.44s]  Can you follow me?
[7904.44s -> 7904.68s]  Yes.
[7907.27s -> 7908.23s]  Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[7909.43s -> 7909.99s]  Just follow me.
[7910.79s -> 7918.10s]  You know, people are coming in my chat sometimes and are still mad that I,
[7918.10s -> 7919.70s]  I dragged you through Terraria too quickly.
[7920.66s -> 7920.90s]  What?
[7922.10s -> 7925.14s]  It's like an ongoing disappointment in some people's lives.
[7926.18s -> 7930.52s]  Well, because you like played Terraria while I watched.
[7932.10s -> 7932.42s]  Yeah.
[7933.14s -> 7937.38s]  I crafted like a, I crafted like a bow and arrow and you beat the game for me.
[7938.39s -> 7939.27s]  Yeah, but it was a good time.
[7939.27s -> 7940.23s]  It was a good, I had a great time.
[7940.23s -> 7940.87s]  Yeah, that was fun.
[7940.87s -> 7941.75s]  People were mad about that.
[7942.31s -> 7942.55s]  Yeah.
[7943.27s -> 7945.19s]  Like he didn't get to enjoy it himself.
[7945.19s -> 7945.51s]  I did.
[7945.51s -> 7945.99s]  No, it was great.
[7946.79s -> 7948.77s]  I played Terraria, Terraria a little bit.
[7950.13s -> 7951.17s]  Not with all the mods.
[7951.81s -> 7952.53s]  I had a great time.
[7952.53s -> 7953.09s]  That was a lot of fun.
[7955.40s -> 7956.68s]  I'm not, I'm not buying it.
[7959.04s -> 7959.52s]  Nice dude.
[7960.64s -> 7961.91s]  How does stamina work?
[7962.63s -> 7966.58s]  Did you also not, you couldn't do it?
[7968.98s -> 7970.10s]  Hey, let me know.
[7970.10s -> 7973.22s]  Tell me if you think I did or didn't buy how loud my Ernie laugh is.
[7974.02s -> 7974.98s]  Hey, I can't do this.
[7977.19s -> 7977.43s]  Okay.
[7977.43s -> 7978.55s]  We need to find another way up.
[7987.00s -> 7988.60s]  Uh, jump fence.
[7990.71s -> 7991.03s]  We're good.
[7991.03s -> 7991.43s]  We're good.
[7991.43s -> 7992.08s]  We're good.
[7992.08s -> 7992.40s]  You good?
[7993.04s -> 7993.92s]  We're good.
[7993.92s -> 7998.32s]  Oh, we got one of the, I heard the inhibitor nearby thing.
[7998.32s -> 7999.84s]  We actually need to start doing that.
[8000.56s -> 8000.96s]  Yeah.
[8000.96s -> 8001.68s]  12 meters.
[8002.48s -> 8005.11s]  It's right, it's right this way.
[8006.08s -> 8007.20s]  You really did play Terraria.
[8007.20s -> 8009.04s]  Name the main character, Thomas Terraria.
[8009.04s -> 8009.36s]  Thank you.
[8015.67s -> 8016.55s]  There's a person up here.
[8023.22s -> 8024.58s]  Oh, there's a window down here.
[8024.58s -> 8025.14s]  We can go in.
[8026.74s -> 8036.40s]  Someone's screaming.
[8037.04s -> 8038.08s]  Someone's screaming down here.
[8038.98s -> 8039.38s]  Screaming.
[8039.94s -> 8042.20s]  Someone's in danger.
[8042.76s -> 8043.08s]  Hurry.
[8044.48s -> 8044.88s]  Loot this.
[8045.96s -> 8046.68s]  Lots of stuff to loot.
[8046.68s -> 8047.32s]  You're right.
[8047.32s -> 8048.28s]  I'm gonna gestalt it.
[8048.84s -> 8051.78s]  I hear screaming.
[8052.74s -> 8053.62s]  I don't hear any screaming.
[8053.62s -> 8054.82s]  Where do you hear screaming?
[8054.82s -> 8057.81s]  Oh, now I do.
[8060.45s -> 8063.99s]  A shithole indeed.
[8064.63s -> 8066.63s]  Did you keep going down?
[8067.43s -> 8069.59s]  I think the inhibitor might be in here somewhere.
[8069.99s -> 8070.87s]  Yeah, it's definitely in here somewhere.
[8071.43s -> 8080.74s]  I'm using gamer vision.
[8080.74s -> 8081.46s]  Where did you go?
[8082.02s -> 8083.70s]  I'm still in the house looking around.
[8083.70s -> 8085.70s]  Oh, there's a, we can climb up here.
[8085.70s -> 8086.26s]  We can go up?
[8086.90s -> 8087.70s]  Yeah, I found it.
[8088.58s -> 8093.51s]  Oh, shit.
[8093.51s -> 8093.75s]  Yep.
[8094.39s -> 8100.00s]  Okay.
[8101.91s -> 8103.35s]  Who is running around up here?
[8104.64s -> 8106.88s]  Someone had neighbors, huge footsteps.
[8108.26s -> 8109.78s]  Oh, there's a gamer up here.
[8111.09s -> 8111.73s]  Oh, gamers.
[8111.73s -> 8113.17s]  Oh, it's these two?
[8113.17s -> 8114.45s]  We're making all that noise?
[8120.00s -> 8122.80s]  Kids, I'm looking for a woman named Maya.
[8122.80s -> 8125.91s]  They were so funny.
[8126.98s -> 8128.02s]  Ain't a grown-up.
[8128.02s -> 8131.01s]  She's just a-
[8131.01s -> 8134.13s]  You were the one trying to sell a PK weapon to Hubert?
[8134.77s -> 8137.01s]  Yeah, but the jerk didn't want it.
[8137.01s -> 8139.01s]  Got all freaked out and chased me away.
[8141.64s -> 8142.14s]  Okay.
[8143.56s -> 8144.20s]  What is she holding?
[8144.20s -> 8145.64s]  Is she holding a grenade?
[8145.64s -> 8146.52s]  Yeah, it's a grenade.
[8146.52s -> 8146.84s]  What?
[8146.84s -> 8147.72s]  It's very important.
[8147.72s -> 8148.22s]  Yeah.
[8148.28s -> 8152.20s]  Do you expect me to just hand that brass Whozzy Whatzit over?
[8152.92s -> 8154.12s]  The Whozzy Whatzit's-
[8154.12s -> 8155.08s]  Oh, it's powder.
[8156.28s -> 8156.78s]  Stop it.
[8157.50s -> 8158.00s]  I can't.
[8159.02s -> 8171.83s]  I just scolded you like we were on a road trip and you're like one of my kids in the car.
[8173.35s -> 8175.19s]  And I'm sick of how like loud you're being.
[8175.19s -> 8176.15s]  Stop it.
[8176.15s -> 8176.65s]  Stop it.
[8177.11s -> 8177.61s]  Enough.
[8178.23s -> 8179.74s]  Okay.
[8182.54s -> 8186.38s]  So, report to Ator.
[8186.38s -> 8188.41s]  We need to get that.
[8190.09s -> 8190.65s]  I got a point.
[8190.65s -> 8191.21s]  Did you get a point?
[8193.78s -> 8194.34s]  No.
[8194.34s -> 8194.82s]  You should have.
[8194.82s -> 8197.06s]  I mean, I got to do the stamina point?
[8197.06s -> 8197.62s]  Yeah.
[8197.62s -> 8199.14s]  I don't know what to put it in.
[8199.14s -> 8201.58s]  Stamina or health?
[8202.78s -> 8203.74s]  I did stamina.
[8204.50s -> 8205.22s]  I don't know.
[8205.22s -> 8207.77s]  Stamina's probably more important.
[8207.77s -> 8209.77s]  Are you a tank or are you a bruiser?
[8209.77s -> 8213.80s]  I'm gonna do stamina.
[8213.80s -> 8216.28s]  Just feel like you really need that health.
[8216.28s -> 8216.92s]  Look at the health bar.
[8216.92s -> 8217.56s]  It's so tiny though.
[8218.95s -> 8219.83s]  Yeah, just don't get hit.
[8223.29s -> 8224.57s]  We got to go do-
[8228.92s -> 8230.04s]  Oh, you want water, by the way.
[8230.04s -> 8230.52s]  Have you had some?
[8230.52s -> 8231.32s]  Cool.
[8231.32s -> 8232.84s]  Get your ass to Ator with you.
[8232.84s -> 8234.20s]  No, I haven't had any water.
[8235.48s -> 8237.56s]  I have no idea when that prick was born.
[8237.56s -> 8238.12s]  I was dead.
[8238.12s -> 8239.80s]  I'll be near metro station.
[8239.80s -> 8240.30s]  Okay.
[8247.64s -> 8249.24s]  Will you tell them to stop sitting on their phones?
[8250.34s -> 8251.14s]  Are they doing it?
[8251.14s -> 8251.62s]  I don't know.
[8251.62s -> 8254.66s]  But you tell people to stop doing the thing you said.
[8254.66s -> 8256.10s]  Do they want to have kids?
[8256.10s -> 8256.42s]  Stop.
[8256.98s -> 8258.15s]  Tell them to stop.
[8259.45s -> 8260.17s]  Guys, come on.
[8260.17s -> 8260.49s]  Stop.
[8260.49s -> 8261.77s]  If you want to have kids, stop.
[8261.77s -> 8262.49s]  But you really shouldn't.
[8262.49s -> 8263.69s]  There's enough people in the world.
[8266.58s -> 8267.78s]  There's an airdrop over there.
[8268.42s -> 8269.46s]  Military airdrop.
[8270.10s -> 8272.38s]  We should go do that.
[8272.38s -> 8273.82s]  There might be like a gun there.
[8273.82s -> 8276.15s]  Let's do it.
[8276.71s -> 8277.67s]  We should do it.
[8277.67s -> 8279.11s]  We did two main story missions.
[8279.11s -> 8279.61s]  We're good.
[8280.07s -> 8280.57s]  Yeah, let's go.
[8281.43s -> 8294.44s]  Up on that roof across the way here.
[8294.92s -> 8303.54s]  Oh, I'm actually murdering.
[8304.26s -> 8306.52s]  I'll get these shrooms.
[8312.15s -> 8312.95s]  If you were to give this game.
[8312.95s -> 8313.67s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[8313.67s -> 8314.39s]  Why is it all green?
[8315.19s -> 8316.18s]  It's green.
[8317.22s -> 8318.02s]  Where's this coming from?
[8318.02s -> 8318.42s]  Chemicals?
[8318.42s -> 8318.82s]  Poison?
[8320.18s -> 8321.14s]  We're poisoned right now?
[8321.14s -> 8321.62s]  We got to go.
[8321.62s -> 8322.90s]  We're going to get our immunity.
[8322.90s -> 8323.94s]  The whole shroom thing.
[8323.94s -> 8324.18s]  Yep.
[8324.18s -> 8324.50s]  Yep.
[8324.50s -> 8324.74s]  Yep.
[8324.74s -> 8324.98s]  Yep.
[8324.98s -> 8325.22s]  Yep.
[8325.22s -> 8325.54s]  Yep.
[8326.42s -> 8329.66s]  You were going to you're about to ask me like a thing.
[8329.66s -> 8330.30s]  Oh, right.
[8331.26s -> 8331.58s]  Okay.
[8331.58s -> 8333.58s]  You would have scored this game one out of a thousand.
[8335.18s -> 8335.90s]  What would you give it?
[8336.54s -> 8340.33s]  Are we doing like Yu-Gi-Oh numbers for scores?
[8341.30s -> 8344.90s]  Well, just imagine like it's like an experience points you can put in
[8346.42s -> 8349.46s]  and getting to one thousand points levels you up to a one out of ten.
[8352.04s -> 8353.40s]  I'm more confused now.
[8353.40s -> 8357.06s]  So so is it a score out of ten thousand?
[8359.75s -> 8363.51s]  No, I mean, like, do you want to put enough experience points in the games to be like,
[8363.51s -> 8364.63s]  yeah, I'm going to give this a rating.
[8367.98s -> 8370.94s]  There's parts of it that I feel like dying light one did better.
[8370.94s -> 8372.22s]  But overall, it's a good game.
[8372.22s -> 8374.22s]  I could give it like a nine thousand.
[8374.22s -> 8374.72s]  Okay.
[8375.26s -> 8380.42s]  An eight thousand before I, you know, we haven't even seen grappling hooks or.
[8380.42s -> 8383.54s]  So you need to take a long time to level up, honestly.
[8383.54s -> 8384.02s]  So wait a minute.
[8384.02s -> 8389.38s]  So you have eight hundred points out of a thousand into being ready to review the game.
[8389.38s -> 8390.10s]  Is that correct?
[8391.14s -> 8394.90s]  Oh, you're saying like how how leveled up is my review?
[8394.90s -> 8395.62s]  Yes.
[8395.62s -> 8397.46s]  Not the score of the review.
[8397.46s -> 8400.42s]  No, like you need a thousand experience points in the game.
[8400.42s -> 8401.94s]  Like how much do you have right now?
[8403.14s -> 8403.62s]  Eight hundred.
[8404.42s -> 8405.38s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[8405.38s -> 8406.82s]  I would say I have like two hundred.
[8406.82s -> 8410.82s]  If we dropped it down to easy, then I would get like a journalist bonus of like five hundred.
[8411.70s -> 8412.20s]  Oh, OK.
[8412.82s -> 8414.22s]  I can feel you.
[8421.22s -> 8421.94s]  What are we doing here?
[8423.70s -> 8424.50s]  I'm just looking at the.
[8425.78s -> 8428.18s]  I'm just looking at the chat and people are just like,
[8428.18s -> 8429.78s]  I have no idea what's fucking happening.
[8430.66s -> 8433.06s]  I barely know what's happening and you're talking to me.
[8444.31s -> 8444.95s]  I know what you're saying.
[8444.95s -> 8447.83s]  The experience bar on are you ready to review this game or not?
[8447.83s -> 8449.91s]  It's like a two hundred out of a thousand right now.
[8449.91s -> 8451.75s]  And you're not going to play anything.
[8451.75s -> 8455.19s]  You are not going to play like the five hundred hours that it takes to beat this game.
[8455.83s -> 8456.15s]  Yeah.
[8456.15s -> 8458.07s]  So like, what's what's my cut off?
[8458.89s -> 8459.85s]  That's for you to decide.
[8459.85s -> 8463.37s]  Whatever you when you whenever you're like, I'm like a two hundred right now.
[8464.42s -> 8465.86s]  This area is weird.
[8465.86s -> 8466.74s]  You have to go up this way.
[8467.46s -> 8475.91s]  I think this is the Ubisoft Climb Climb upper.
[8475.91s -> 8477.51s]  And there's a bunch of stuff up there, though.
[8478.15s -> 8481.27s]  I don't see any way outside here.
[8481.99s -> 8484.46s]  Oh, my immunity.
[8484.46s -> 8485.50s]  I'm getting whipped.
[8485.50s -> 8486.46s]  Oh, this is actually really bad.
[8487.42s -> 8491.03s]  Remember, this is the kind of conversation you have to huffing fumes.
[8491.67s -> 8493.50s]  And I've been huffing.
[8494.70s -> 8495.26s]  What's wrong?
[8495.26s -> 8499.72s]  Oh, we I think we've kind of run out of time here.
[8500.76s -> 8504.15s]  Oh, I mean, I have shroomies.
[8507.32s -> 8509.54s]  It looks like from here.
[8510.18s -> 8514.52s]  Hold on.
[8514.52s -> 8516.12s]  We're trying to get to the top of this building.
[8516.68s -> 8517.90s]  What about on this side?
[8519.90s -> 8522.22s]  Is that platform right here on top of me?
[8522.22s -> 8523.10s]  How do we get to that one?
[8526.62s -> 8528.22s]  Kind of worried that maybe we don't have like
[8529.10s -> 8529.98s]  an ability for it.
[8529.98s -> 8531.90s]  Oh, wait, the metroidvania.
[8531.90s -> 8533.50s]  Yeah, I think there's a way to get up over here.
[8534.47s -> 8535.19s]  Yeah, there is.
[8535.19s -> 8535.67s]  Come to me.
[8536.31s -> 8537.27s]  Fucking Jesus.
[8537.83s -> 8539.51s]  I actually almost just shit my pants.
[8539.51s -> 8539.99s]  I'm serious.
[8540.71s -> 8541.83s]  I just almost jumped off.
[8541.83s -> 8543.83s]  I like the same thing.
[8543.83s -> 8544.39s]  That's right.
[8544.87s -> 8545.91s]  I'm not crazy.
[8547.38s -> 8552.73s]  Yeah, but like now from here, we can keep going.
[8552.73s -> 8553.21s]  Just keep going.
[8554.63s -> 8555.75s]  We fully wrapped around.
[8555.75s -> 8557.03s]  OK, we go up here.
[8557.03s -> 8560.55s]  Here we go.
[8560.55s -> 8563.79s]  Nice.
[8567.80s -> 8569.48s]  We're going up to the top all the way.
[8569.48s -> 8571.88s]  There should be a cache up here.
[8581.22s -> 8581.78s]  Not this way.
[8582.79s -> 8584.15s]  Oh, we got to do some jumpies.
[8584.71s -> 8585.27s]  Oh, great.
[8588.54s -> 8589.10s]  It'll be worth it.
[8589.10s -> 8589.74s]  Whatever's in here.
[8590.54s -> 8592.14s]  I have no more shrooms left.
[8592.14s -> 8592.62s]  We got to go.
[8593.26s -> 8594.78s]  I've got shrooms if you really need them.
[8596.10s -> 8598.10s]  I collected the artifact, the ancient artifact
[8598.10s -> 8599.54s]  left behind by predecessors.
[8605.18s -> 8606.46s]  You can hide under this table if you want.
[8609.34s -> 8610.14s]  There's a lot of them here.
[8610.14s -> 8611.42s]  I wonder if somebody chases you.
[8611.42s -> 8620.76s]  Oh, my God.
[8620.76s -> 8621.48s]  What?
[8621.48s -> 8623.08s]  Apparently, you can walk on that.
[8623.08s -> 8623.48s]  You can.
[8626.78s -> 8628.22s]  Oh, that was crazy.
[8628.22s -> 8629.42s]  I can't believe you actually made that.
[8632.17s -> 8636.41s]  All right, I'm fine.
[8638.04s -> 8639.00s]  I know you've waited.
[8639.00s -> 8641.16s]  You're turning the camera back because you know,
[8641.16s -> 8641.80s]  you're like, here goes.
[8641.80s -> 8642.12s]  You're going to fall.
[8643.13s -> 8644.97s]  I just want to make sure my little bro's making it.
[8644.97s -> 8646.33s]  Like, make sure powder is all right.
[8647.61s -> 8648.57s]  All right, here we are.
[8649.13s -> 8653.35s]  OK, right here.
[8653.35s -> 8654.82s]  Whatever this is.
[8655.46s -> 8659.32s]  Hey, are you about to turn, man?
[8660.28s -> 8661.32s]  No, I'm good.
[8661.32s -> 8666.81s]  I think I have immunity boosters.
[8668.17s -> 8670.41s]  Military airdrop, military tech.
[8673.94s -> 8674.50s]  Oh, OK.
[8674.50s -> 8675.62s]  We got military tech.
[8676.26s -> 8678.50s]  Is this an immunity booster?
[8678.50s -> 8680.98s]  You go to a craft master to upgrade your tools.
[8680.98s -> 8682.10s]  I need my tools.
[8682.10s -> 8683.38s]  OK, so that's an immunity booster.
[8683.38s -> 8684.34s]  I think I'll be here.
[8684.34s -> 8684.90s]  Yeah, all right.
[8684.90s -> 8687.14s]  So the immunity booster fills up your immunity bar completely.
[8687.86s -> 8689.80s]  OK.
[8689.80s -> 8691.08s]  The inhaler, the purple inhaler.
[8691.64s -> 8694.38s]  Where's the assassin's creed?
[8694.38s -> 8694.86s]  Jump down.
[8694.86s -> 8695.98s]  Is that the only thing that was up here?
[8696.86s -> 8697.36s]  Yeah.
[8697.84s -> 8703.02s]  Like a zipline or a...
[8703.74s -> 8705.02s]  You would think there would be something like that here,
[8705.02s -> 8706.84s]  but apparently not.
[8706.84s -> 8707.72s]  What the fuck?
[8707.72s -> 8709.40s]  I thought you just turned into Wally on my screen.
[8709.40s -> 8709.90s]  That was weird.
[8712.09s -> 8712.59s]  Yeah.
[8713.60s -> 8714.10s]  OK.
[8718.89s -> 8719.61s]  It really should be.
[8720.57s -> 8721.82s]  Here we go.
[8721.82s -> 8722.38s]  They're right here.
[8722.94s -> 8723.81s]  OK.
[8724.11s -> 8725.04s]  You ready?
[8725.58s -> 8726.06s]  You're doing?
[8726.06s -> 8726.94s]  Oh my god, you're doing it.
[8726.94s -> 8729.50s]  No, there's an assassin's creed thing right here.
[8730.06s -> 8731.21s]  OK, go for it.
[8734.01s -> 8734.73s]  Made it.
[8734.73s -> 8735.23s]  OK.
[8735.23s -> 8744.32s]  I'm critical.
[8744.32s -> 8745.04s]  Are you actually?
[8747.28s -> 8747.84s]  Do you have help?
[8750.91s -> 8751.55s]  Yeah, no, we're good.
[8751.55s -> 8752.59s]  We got to run.
[8752.59s -> 8753.55s]  Yeah, we actually do have to go.
[8754.35s -> 8755.31s]  All right, to the marker or?
[8757.50s -> 8759.74s]  To UV light or any kind of light.
[8761.02s -> 8761.74s]  Can't be out at night.
[8761.74s -> 8762.30s]  It's dangerous.
[8762.30s -> 8763.66s]  We're far away from that marker.
[8764.38s -> 8766.08s]  Oh my fuck.
[8766.08s -> 8766.88s]  This giant.
[8767.60s -> 8768.72s]  Is there fast travel?
[8768.72s -> 8769.28s]  I think there is.
[8770.24s -> 8772.32s]  Uh oh.
[8772.86s -> 8773.82s]  We got squelchers.
[8778.58s -> 8779.30s]  Make a new meme.
[8779.86s -> 8785.07s]  Oh shit, the chase started.
[8787.17s -> 8788.13s]  We started the chase.
[8789.74s -> 8791.18s]  Oh shit, the chase started.
[8791.18s -> 8794.14s]  I want to see if you have what it takes to beat me.
[8795.18s -> 8795.90s]  Top text.
[8795.90s -> 8796.70s]  The chase started.
[8796.70s -> 8797.42s]  Bottom text.
[8798.78s -> 8799.28s]  Oh no.
[8800.22s -> 8802.38s]  I'm going to offer you $50,000.
[8802.38s -> 8804.62s]  It says you can't beat me in trivia.
[8805.42s -> 8808.18s]  Trade request.
[8808.18s -> 8809.86s]  All right, Beastie, here we go.
[8813.49s -> 8821.49s]  You following me, powder?
[8823.14s -> 8823.64s]  Yeah.
[8829.51s -> 8831.01s]  Oh, you're going.
[8831.01s -> 8832.37s]  She's such a misfit.
[8832.93s -> 8834.21s]  Always ready to fight.
[8834.21s -> 8835.97s]  She's got a super beam.
[8835.97s -> 8837.89s]  And she's raising high.
[8837.89s -> 8839.41s]  If you believe you're strong.
[8840.21s -> 8843.70s]  So you know the whole song?
[8843.70s -> 8844.66s]  I don't know.
[8844.66s -> 8845.94s]  I heard like a minute of it.
[8846.74s -> 8847.24s]  Okay.
[8850.13s -> 8854.13s]  Okay, can we like not sleep or like pass time or?
[8854.77s -> 8856.05s]  We haven't really figured that out yet.
[8856.05s -> 8856.69s]  There's a couch.
[8856.69s -> 8858.45s]  You want to like chill on the couch?
[8862.64s -> 8863.52s]  I'm laughing.
[8864.40s -> 8864.64s]  Okay.
[8864.64s -> 8865.36s]  Yeah, we need to sleep.
[8871.28s -> 8871.78s]  Why?
[8876.15s -> 8880.87s]  I can't believe you did not react to me doing the the Vi theme song.
[8880.87s -> 8882.47s]  Did you just pretend I wasn't doing that?
[8883.27s -> 8884.63s]  Are those actually the words?
[8884.63s -> 8885.03s]  Kind of.
[8885.59s -> 8886.47s]  I don't know.
[8887.03s -> 8888.71s]  All I know is oh the misery.
[8890.71s -> 8891.43s]  Watch yourself.
[8892.31s -> 8893.83s]  No, you don't know.
[8893.83s -> 8894.63s]  Wow.
[8894.63s -> 8895.19s]  Fake fan.
[8896.90s -> 8897.86s]  I'm not a fan.
[8898.82s -> 8900.90s]  So we don't actually sleep here?
[8902.40s -> 8903.04s]  Yeah, either.
[8903.04s -> 8909.52s]  I feel like there must be a button to like pass the time.
[8909.52s -> 8911.20s]  I thought that would be right here.
[8911.76s -> 8914.02s]  Can you not do that on multiplayer?
[8916.72s -> 8917.20s]  I don't know.
[8917.76s -> 8919.67s]  Here.
[8919.67s -> 8922.07s]  We're going to survive the night and get the EXP bonus.
[8922.07s -> 8922.55s]  How about that?
[8923.11s -> 8923.59s]  I guess.
[8924.15s -> 8925.59s]  What's our current objective?
[8925.59s -> 8927.91s]  Oh, you can't sleep in all the safe houses.
[8927.91s -> 8928.47s]  Only some.
[8928.47s -> 8929.91s]  Report to Eeyore.
[8929.91s -> 8931.43s]  Let's go in this direction.
[8938.84s -> 8939.48s]  Oh, the church.
[8939.48s -> 8940.68s]  Well, church like right here, right?
[8943.24s -> 8944.44s]  Like Sunday mass, right?
[8947.24s -> 8949.08s]  Oh, this is a point of interest.
[8949.08s -> 8953.11s]  Yeah, push out that.
[8965.60s -> 8967.52s]  And now we can sleep here.
[8968.08s -> 8969.04s]  This is not.
[8969.04s -> 8970.32s]  No, we're going to the other area.
[8971.78s -> 8972.90s]  I don't want to sleep ever.
[8973.54s -> 8974.02s]  Okay.
[8974.02s -> 8980.76s]  This is this is why the forces of evil fear the Nephilim because they never rest.
[8985.57s -> 8987.09s]  What's your favorite Lord of the Rings movie?
[8989.12s -> 8993.80s]  Um, isn't there just one?
[8995.81s -> 8997.49s]  Just one of the Lord of the Rings movie?
[8998.21s -> 8999.17s]  Yeah, Lord of the Ring.
[9004.60s -> 9007.30s]  Mine's um, mine's return to the king.
[9007.86s -> 9011.36s]  I like the part that Peter that Peter Jackson wanted to remove.
[9011.36s -> 9012.56s]  Was my favorite part of the whole movie.
[9012.56s -> 9015.84s]  And it's the one that he said is his least favorite thing he's ever done in cinema.
[9015.84s -> 9016.48s]  That's my favorite.
[9016.48s -> 9019.60s]  I don't which scene I don't know too much about Lord of the Rings.
[9019.60s -> 9022.40s]  Honestly, the ghost people, the ghost ship people.
[9024.44s -> 9027.40s]  I don't remember a ghost ship.
[9029.06s -> 9030.82s]  Well, let me see if I can jog your memory.
[9031.78s -> 9032.50s]  What say you?
[9033.06s -> 9035.96s]  What say you the help?
[9037.72s -> 9043.75s]  No, it was a ghost ship.
[9043.75s -> 9051.16s]  Yeah, this is like a SpongeBob reference.
[9051.96s -> 9056.36s]  No, there was a bunch of scenes where they were ghosts in like this tomb.
[9057.08s -> 9064.44s]  And they had to go to the tomb and get the uh, the the legions of the ghost people.
[9065.24s -> 9067.38s]  Pirates of the Caribbean.
[9067.38s -> 9070.58s]  No, and the guy walks over and he's like, oh, you best not believe it in ghost stories.
[9070.58s -> 9073.48s]  Because you're in one.
[9073.48s -> 9076.28s]  And then they help them at that battle with the elephants and stuff.
[9081.01s -> 9082.37s]  Death will be repaid.
[9082.93s -> 9085.57s]  You don't this happened in that movie, right?
[9086.13s -> 9088.71s]  Thanks, but uh, sorry.
[9088.71s -> 9098.24s]  Uh, it was the Gondor, the ghost of Gondor.
[9098.24s -> 9100.79s]  Yeah, and they came in on a ship.
[9101.43s -> 9104.44s]  They were in the movie for like 35 seconds.
[9104.44s -> 9107.25s]  Now, I said she needs lavender for her.
[9107.25s -> 9108.45s]  I believe you.
[9108.45s -> 9109.57s]  Now, that makes more sense.
[9110.21s -> 9113.08s]  Metal scraps.
[9113.08s -> 9115.80s]  Nairo wants them Lord of the gaslighting.
[9115.80s -> 9119.40s]  Nobody even said that chase making perfume out of metal.
[9119.40s -> 9120.28s]  Sounds absurd.
[9121.96s -> 9124.36s]  I mean, I'm just trying to do quests and objectives here.
[9125.48s -> 9126.20s]  Oh, no, I'm dead.
[9126.92s -> 9129.06s]  Ow, my leg.
[9129.62s -> 9132.74s]  Hold on.
[9132.74s -> 9133.54s]  I'm going to do some.
[9133.54s -> 9134.66s]  I've got to do some crafting.
[9135.30s -> 9138.44s]  You good?
[9139.16s -> 9145.24s]  I feel like if you own old Aragorn a debt.
[9145.24s -> 9151.62s]  Yeah, and Peter Jackson said that was the worst thing he's ever done.
[9152.50s -> 9157.03s]  He's like, he's like, I wish I fucking deleted that from the whole fucking movie.
[9157.67s -> 9158.56s]  And I was like, what?
[9158.56s -> 9159.36s]  I like that scene.
[9162.12s -> 9164.44s]  Did you like it or did you like think it was funny?
[9165.08s -> 9166.20s]  No, I actually liked it.
[9166.20s -> 9168.52s]  I've I need a new topic.
[9168.52s -> 9169.96s]  I don't know what's going on right now.
[9169.96s -> 9170.84s]  I don't know what's real.
[9170.84s -> 9171.88s]  I don't know what's not real.
[9178.63s -> 9181.19s]  I owed Aragorn community subs.
[9183.43s -> 9186.68s]  I don't know why that's so funny to me.
[9186.68s -> 9194.56s]  Did you guys both take a tab of acid before playing this?
[9195.52s -> 9199.20s]  No, it's been a while since stir and I have like just played a game.
[9199.20s -> 9201.76s]  What we can't like we can't relax and have a good time.
[9201.76s -> 9203.12s]  Talk about microwaving stuff.
[9203.92s -> 9205.67s]  Can't talk about magnets.
[9206.39s -> 9209.59s]  I'm not all caught up on the microwaving and the other stuff.
[9209.59s -> 9210.47s]  Like this is new to me.
[9210.47s -> 9214.31s]  You guys probably hear it every single day, but I didn't I didn't know the microwave lore.
[9218.74s -> 9223.54s]  Oh, we were helping the guy from here doing a quest or something.
[9223.54s -> 9225.46s]  And now we're reporting back.
[9225.46s -> 9227.22s]  So we're completing the quest.
[9227.22s -> 9228.82s]  Whatever it was that we did for him.
[9229.54s -> 9231.99s]  I was to look for Eeyore.
[9232.71s -> 9234.07s]  We're just inside, right?
[9234.07s -> 9234.87s]  We're just inside.
[9239.28s -> 9245.88s]  Okay, I need all the characters.
[9245.88s -> 9246.76s]  I need all the players here.
[9249.25s -> 9250.36s]  Excuse me.
[9251.00s -> 9254.47s]  I'm here.
[9260.55s -> 9263.75s]  So you're comfortable microwaving popcorn even though it kind of scares you?
[9265.81s -> 9267.73s]  Like you'll eat you'll eat the popcorn.
[9268.37s -> 9270.05s]  I'm not afraid of microwaves.
[9270.05s -> 9271.33s]  They just are a little odd.
[9272.69s -> 9276.39s]  So wouldn't you just rather pop your popcorn on like the stovetop?
[9276.39s -> 9277.19s]  It actually is.
[9277.19s -> 9278.31s]  It actually is kind of better that way.
[9278.31s -> 9283.52s]  Anyways, I hear that get a nice little crisp to it.
[9283.52s -> 9288.08s]  But you do the thing that everybody accidentally does and you put way too much kernels in.
[9288.96s -> 9290.32s]  You think you're going to have.
[9290.32s -> 9291.28s]  Oh, no, that's not enough.
[9292.23s -> 9293.43s]  Let me just tell you right now.
[9293.43s -> 9296.95s]  It's enough at first scoop is enough worried about me.
[9297.59s -> 9301.67s]  Honestly, you're kind of making me want to pop some popcorn outside.
[9301.67s -> 9302.55s]  Yeah, no, you should.
[9303.43s -> 9305.11s]  But like I don't have a microwave.
[9305.11s -> 9306.71s]  So, you know, old fashioned.
[9306.71s -> 9308.55s]  I won't have to like worry about the radiation.
[9309.43s -> 9310.55s]  I love popcorn on the stove.
[9310.55s -> 9311.27s]  It's awesome.
[9311.27s -> 9313.51s]  But you end up doing way too much and then just gets everywhere.
[9314.15s -> 9315.75s]  We got to talk to Khan.
[9315.75s -> 9317.91s]  I just saw a ladder and I was like, I'm going to climb that.
[9317.91s -> 9327.54s]  You know what else is really good?
[9328.26s -> 9329.38s]  Can you come over here?
[9329.38s -> 9330.74s]  I'm trying to get down.
[9330.74s -> 9332.26s]  I didn't think he was looking at me.
[9333.27s -> 9334.63s]  It wants me to find Lucas's.
[9335.59s -> 9337.03s]  Only then will he help me get to the center.
[9337.03s -> 9338.55s]  Have you ever toasted your own sunflower seeds?
[9338.55s -> 9341.11s]  Dirty work only to know head.
[9341.11s -> 9344.26s]  So you buy just raw sunflower seeds.
[9345.86s -> 9348.69s]  Taking out of the shell and you just put it.
[9348.69s -> 9350.69s]  You got to take them all out of the shell yourself.
[9350.69s -> 9351.09s]  No, no, no.
[9351.09s -> 9352.45s]  Just buy the ones that are out of the shell.
[9352.45s -> 9353.97s]  They sell raw, untoasted.
[9353.97s -> 9354.77s]  You can do it yourself.
[9354.77s -> 9355.33s]  OK.
[9355.33s -> 9355.65s]  Yeah.
[9355.65s -> 9355.97s]  OK.
[9355.97s -> 9357.25s]  I'm like a king.
[9357.25s -> 9360.37s]  I don't have time for that, but you can control the amount of salt
[9360.37s -> 9362.85s]  you put on and any other little things you want to add to it, too.
[9362.85s -> 9364.69s]  I don't really add a lot of things.
[9364.69s -> 9367.57s]  You know, I'm kind of like kind of basic.
[9368.21s -> 9369.65s]  I'll just put a little salt on it.
[9369.65s -> 9369.97s]  It's good.
[9369.97s -> 9370.69s]  It's really easy, too.
[9371.25s -> 9371.49s]  Why?
[9372.29s -> 9374.61s]  I don't know, because it's fun to do the new things.
[9374.61s -> 9376.53s]  It's fun to, like, experience our world.
[9376.53s -> 9376.69s]  Why?
[9376.69s -> 9377.33s]  What do you mean, why?
[9377.89s -> 9379.09s]  I mean, why put salt on it?
[9379.09s -> 9379.97s]  Why not just toast it?
[9379.97s -> 9380.53s]  Oh, OK.
[9380.53s -> 9385.28s]  Just you could.
[9385.28s -> 9387.92s]  But the flavor wouldn't be kind of we're going this way.
[9388.48s -> 9389.44s]  It'd be a little dull.
[9394.64s -> 9396.48s]  Stir know that you grew sunflowers.
[9396.48s -> 9396.96s]  I think so.
[9396.96s -> 9397.36s]  Is it?
[9397.36s -> 9398.56s]  Do you hear about the sunflower?
[9398.56s -> 9398.96s]  I know.
[9400.45s -> 9401.41s]  Why would you know about that?
[9401.41s -> 9402.45s]  Actually, now that I think about it.
[9403.67s -> 9405.35s]  That's very weird.
[9405.35s -> 9406.95s]  It was like 10 feet tall.
[9406.95s -> 9407.35s]  It's huge.
[9408.96s -> 9414.05s]  Oh, and then you toast at your own sunflowers.
[9414.05s -> 9415.73s]  I gather from this tale.
[9417.06s -> 9417.86s]  No, you didn't.
[9417.86s -> 9418.18s]  I didn't.
[9419.14s -> 9420.34s]  I just grew some flowers.
[9421.22s -> 9424.18s]  Me and my girlfriend, we put them into a container
[9425.48s -> 9426.44s]  and we're going to plant.
[9426.44s -> 9430.12s]  We're going to pick out, like, the ones we're going to plant them again next season.
[9430.12s -> 9431.00s]  Why did I say it like that?
[9431.00s -> 9432.04s]  Like, season?
[9432.04s -> 9433.59s]  I don't know.
[9435.73s -> 9437.86s]  Wait, so OK.
[9439.25s -> 9439.97s]  We're not going to eat them.
[9439.97s -> 9440.69s]  We're going to replant them.
[9441.25s -> 9444.68s]  Because here's the thing about growing plants.
[9444.68s -> 9445.48s]  If you don't know, stir.
[9446.12s -> 9446.84s]  I don't.
[9446.84s -> 9449.16s]  If you want to grow, let's say, sunflowers,
[9449.16s -> 9452.04s]  you don't just plant one sunflower in the ground and go, OK.
[9452.60s -> 9454.52s]  Because it might not actually grow.
[9454.52s -> 9455.96s]  You don't plant one.
[9455.96s -> 9456.28s]  OK.
[9456.28s -> 9456.92s]  I didn't know that.
[9456.92s -> 9459.16s]  I thought you just did one sunflower.
[9460.04s -> 9461.72s]  Well, but then you were like, good.
[9461.72s -> 9463.56s]  And then like a whole field of them would grow.
[9464.36s -> 9464.92s]  No.
[9464.92s -> 9468.76s]  My point is if you want, let's say you want like two or three sunflowers in the same area.
[9468.76s -> 9472.68s]  You have to plant like 15 in that kind of small zone.
[9472.68s -> 9474.60s]  And then you have to get rid of the stragglers.
[9474.60s -> 9475.32s]  It's called thinning.
[9475.96s -> 9476.84s]  It's actually really sad.
[9477.97s -> 9479.65s]  Some of them are just not strong enough.
[9479.65s -> 9483.09s]  That is sad.
[9483.09s -> 9483.41s]  It is.
[9483.41s -> 9484.45s]  No, it is sad.
[9484.45s -> 9490.63s]  Well, what if you take the stragglers and you move them somewhere else?
[9490.63s -> 9491.11s]  Yeah, you could.
[9491.11s -> 9491.99s]  They get their own space.
[9491.99s -> 9492.31s]  You could.
[9492.31s -> 9493.43s]  But they might not go.
[9493.43s -> 9494.23s]  They might not keep going.
[9496.64s -> 9498.08s]  This is a really weird first date.
[9500.08s -> 9501.52s]  So it's in these microwaves.
[9501.52s -> 9502.24s]  Let me tell you something.
[9502.88s -> 9504.93s]  You can put a magnet on your head.
[9504.93s -> 9509.17s]  Why did you sit on your cellular device?
[9509.17s -> 9512.69s]  It's called you have to thin out your sunflower seeds and it's sad.
[9512.69s -> 9514.77s]  I can't plant them all on you.
[9518.52s -> 9520.04s]  This guy has so much to say.
[9521.16s -> 9522.07s]  Go that way.
[9522.07s -> 9522.39s]  Okay.
[9522.39s -> 9523.59s]  You'll see a giant man.
[9523.59s -> 9523.83s]  Okay.
[9526.05s -> 9527.97s]  Yeah, we actually gave some as gifts.
[9533.20s -> 9533.60s]  Okay.
[9533.60s -> 9533.76s]  Yeah.
[9533.76s -> 9535.68s]  Let me mail you a sunflower.
[9535.68s -> 9536.88s]  That would be pretty cool.
[9537.52s -> 9538.16s]  It wouldn't make it.
[9538.88s -> 9539.76s]  Why wouldn't it make it?
[9542.39s -> 9542.87s]  Oh, shit.
[9543.83s -> 9547.76s]  You should email him a sunflower.
[9548.40s -> 9550.10s]  Like I didn't I didn't hear the story.
[9550.10s -> 9551.06s]  I didn't see a picture.
[9556.80s -> 9558.96s]  Your off stream life is a mystery to me.
[9558.96s -> 9563.84s]  Like I'm curious what you do as hobbies because you show up hobbies.
[9563.84s -> 9566.56s]  Yesterday you made you show up like for a new year stream
[9566.56s -> 9568.00s]  and then you're gone till next New Year's.
[9568.00s -> 9569.44s]  It's like, what are you doing in the meanwhile?
[9571.20s -> 9572.48s]  Looking for a job.
[9572.48s -> 9572.88s]  I don't know.
[9572.88s -> 9574.24s]  I just like live my life, man.
[9574.24s -> 9575.36s]  Trust you.
[9576.00s -> 9576.64s]  It's grown some.
[9576.64s -> 9578.32s]  I mean, I didn't know about the grown sunflowers.
[9578.32s -> 9579.04s]  That's the thing.
[9579.04s -> 9580.40s]  Yeah, I'm kind of into plants.
[9581.12s -> 9582.24s]  Sad update.
[9582.24s -> 9583.12s]  Really sad update.
[9584.24s -> 9587.92s]  I had a money tree and it wasn't doing well.
[9588.82s -> 9590.10s]  I tried to replant it.
[9590.10s -> 9593.70s]  I tried to help it give it some space and it didn't make it.
[9593.70s -> 9594.66s]  That was actually really sad.
[9595.46s -> 9607.80s]  The money tree is a perfect place for shade or.
[9610.63s -> 9615.56s]  I was looking for some support is what I was looking for.
[9616.36s -> 9618.60s]  Well, I'll support you when I know what it is.
[9618.60s -> 9618.92s]  All right.
[9618.92s -> 9622.20s]  So we got get some work at the czar and earn Sophie's trust.
[9622.20s -> 9625.54s]  OK, it's a tree.
[9626.98s -> 9628.18s]  You can get they come in different sizes.
[9642.23s -> 9647.64s]  OK, I can upgrade your blueprint if you bring me.
[9650.60s -> 9652.36s]  13 infected trophies.
[9652.36s -> 9653.40s]  Why is he posing?
[9660.47s -> 9662.07s]  I said fuck you up like.
[9662.07s -> 9665.27s]  Yeah, I like all the parts of this game that aren't like talking to people.
[9665.99s -> 9667.99s]  Well, I mean, you have to sell items and stuff.
[9668.79s -> 9671.27s]  Yeah, but like all the crap, I just like running around the city
[9671.27s -> 9675.11s]  and they're being, you know, zombies and, you know, you looting, you know.
[9675.11s -> 9676.47s]  This is so much more damage than what I have.
[9677.72s -> 9678.44s]  Twenty five.
[9684.90s -> 9695.48s]  I don't I don't get some work at the bizarre from who got a lot of good weapons now.
[9696.60s -> 9698.76s]  Oh, do I have your permission?
[9700.24s -> 9700.88s]  Mission for what?
[9707.11s -> 9707.83s]  Quest giver.
[9707.83s -> 9713.92s]  OK, I'm Damian.
[9722.66s -> 9725.78s]  Hey, hey, streamer, maybe you'd like to everything else more
[9725.78s -> 9727.14s]  if you'd actually talk to anyone.
[9727.78s -> 9731.27s]  I mean, people have people have a point, right?
[9731.27s -> 9734.63s]  Like we're not immersing ourselves in the story.
[9734.63s -> 9739.59s]  We're literally going as fast as we can to go swing chivalry weapons at people.
[9739.59s -> 9742.79s]  I'm immersed in the parts that I want to be immersed in,
[9742.79s -> 9745.67s]  which is like hanging out with an identical clone of myself
[9745.67s -> 9748.63s]  and just like having a good time jumping around rafters
[9748.63s -> 9751.35s]  and jumping off buildings and doing monkey swings.
[9751.35s -> 9755.78s]  I don't think we got we didn't get a mission from that person.
[9755.78s -> 9757.86s]  OK, yeah, we have to go talk to someone else now.
[9765.32s -> 9765.88s]  All players.
[9768.26s -> 9770.50s]  And see, then this guy's like, oh, give you a job.
[9770.50s -> 9771.14s]  You want a job.
[9772.82s -> 9773.78s]  I think you got to play cards.
[9774.82s -> 9775.62s]  A job.
[9775.62s -> 9776.74s]  Oh, you want a job.
[9776.82s -> 9777.78s]  I got to work.
[9777.78s -> 9779.46s]  It's like, how did the conversation take that long?
[9779.46s -> 9782.26s]  That's why I'm a secretary and wedding ring on the wrong finger.
[9782.26s -> 9782.66s]  Come on.
[9782.66s -> 9783.86s]  Don't fuck with me.
[9783.86s -> 9784.58s]  I'm serious.
[9784.58s -> 9786.42s]  Well, then it's not a wedding here.
[9786.42s -> 9788.18s]  Like you own the place sticks.
[9788.18s -> 9789.70s]  Coconut sized balls.
[9792.61s -> 9795.70s]  OK, I might have a just a ring, dude.
[9797.28s -> 9798.88s]  Oh, minor thing.
[9799.76s -> 9800.64s]  This is a ring.
[9800.64s -> 9802.08s]  But it's a ring.
[9803.57s -> 9806.26s]  Oh, why did I ask why?
[9809.38s -> 9810.90s]  OK, he gave us a small job.
[9811.30s -> 9812.26s]  I think we can handle it.
[9812.26s -> 9813.46s]  The balls in your court.
[9813.46s -> 9813.86s]  All right.
[9813.86s -> 9815.86s]  Track track that.
[9816.50s -> 9818.02s]  Now we're going to earn their trust.
[9818.02s -> 9820.50s]  I mean, once we have their trust, we're going to split their throats.
[9820.50s -> 9831.22s]  I think we are the family in infantry.
[9832.44s -> 9833.32s]  Oh, my God, man.
[9833.88s -> 9834.92s]  Not coming up.
[9834.92s -> 9835.56s]  You have six.
[9836.74s -> 9837.22s]  Yeah, it is.
[9839.72s -> 9842.68s]  I want to beg you to play that and then like play for like a day
[9842.68s -> 9843.64s]  and then never talk to you again.
[9845.32s -> 9846.60s]  Like I said, you would.
[9846.60s -> 9847.10s]  Yep.
[9847.98s -> 9849.19s]  I was like, oh, yeah, real fun.
[9849.19s -> 9850.47s]  We'll play again sometime.
[9850.47s -> 9852.87s]  And then like, I think three years went by.
[9856.06s -> 9857.58s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[9857.58s -> 9858.86s]  I never apologize for that.
[9860.62s -> 9861.26s]  These bad guys.
[9863.37s -> 9873.90s]  Yeah, I'm not going to take the first swing because it's that's even.
[9873.90s -> 9874.30s]  I'm not.
[9874.30s -> 9875.26s]  It's not funny.
[9875.26s -> 9875.82s]  Like what do you think?
[9875.82s -> 9878.22s]  It's funny to just hit people and be mean all the time.
[9881.83s -> 9883.27s]  We got to find this building over here.
[9888.07s -> 9888.39s]  Oh, yeah.
[9888.39s -> 9889.83s]  But we're playing EDF six, right?
[9891.24s -> 9891.64s]  Maybe.
[9891.64s -> 9892.36s]  I don't know.
[9892.36s -> 9892.92s]  It depends.
[9892.92s -> 9893.56s]  It's going to be good.
[9898.36s -> 9899.48s]  Why wouldn't it be good?
[9899.48s -> 9900.36s]  I don't know.
[9900.36s -> 9903.37s]  Those games are so much fun, though.
[9904.09s -> 9906.15s]  Yeah.
[9906.15s -> 9906.95s]  So why do you doubt?
[9908.86s -> 9911.26s]  I mean, they take a long time to play, though.
[9911.90s -> 9915.78s]  If you're going to play EDF, it's not just like, yeah, you know, I'll play EDF for an hour.
[9915.78s -> 9916.18s]  You have to play.
[9916.18s -> 9918.42s]  You have to commit like 100 hours to EDF for it to be fun.
[9919.38s -> 9921.05s]  Or at least like 30.
[9928.94s -> 9930.46s]  Hubert, you here?
[9931.34s -> 9932.22s]  Dodger sent me.
[9933.18s -> 9934.14s]  Did he?
[9934.14s -> 9939.40s]  Are we going to find a way inside?
[9940.12s -> 9944.17s]  It's so pretty.
[9944.17s -> 9944.65s]  It really is.
[9948.76s -> 9949.26s]  Window.
[9954.47s -> 9954.71s]  I don't know.
[9954.71s -> 9956.31s]  I'm not sure where you're going, but I'm going to follow you.
[9958.31s -> 9959.75s]  I mean, I see a door over there.
[9959.75s -> 9961.19s]  I thought there might be a window somewhere.
[9961.19s -> 9962.07s]  We're trying to get in here.
[9962.07s -> 9963.03s]  Oh, there's a window right here.
[9965.80s -> 9966.60s]  There's heads.
[9966.60s -> 9967.16s]  Heads, bro.
[9967.16s -> 9968.28s]  I need your help, bro.
[9968.28s -> 9968.92s]  Thanks for the subs.
[9969.48s -> 9972.68s]  I'm trying to get off.
[9973.32s -> 9974.01s]  Watch out.
[9974.01s -> 9974.33s]  Watch out.
[9974.33s -> 9974.65s]  Watch out.
[9974.65s -> 9975.05s]  Watch out.
[9977.29s -> 9978.49s]  Came with a weapon this time.
[9989.38s -> 9992.66s]  Oh, there's tracks.
[9993.46s -> 9998.18s]  Yeah, because we're trying to figure out where the guy went.
[9998.18s -> 9999.06s]  Oh, cool.
[9999.14s -> 10003.54s]  In his place, his place appears to be infested, you know, from context clues.
[10005.62s -> 10006.74s]  But I'm just kind of looting.
[10007.75s -> 10008.39s]  Kind of what you do.
[10009.34s -> 10010.94s]  Yeah, I'm just opening up these boxes.
[10012.60s -> 10014.52s]  We're going to have to make it into the final circle soon, though.
[10019.19s -> 10020.63s]  Yeah, I see there's footprints.
[10020.63s -> 10027.22s]  They go probably up.
[10027.22s -> 10029.66s]  No, I'm going to climb this footprint.
[10030.30s -> 10033.51s]  That looks like we're going to be going down.
[10034.23s -> 10039.82s]  Where do we go from here?
[10043.96s -> 10044.44s]  Woodrobe.
[10046.42s -> 10048.74s]  Yeah, we've got to check and make sure there's not like another world in there.
[10051.16s -> 10052.20s]  Oh, we got a tunnel.
[10054.33s -> 10054.81s]  Perfect.
[10055.77s -> 10060.95s]  A secret gremlin tunnel where you like, you climb around in here for a little bit,
[10060.95s -> 10062.07s]  then you jump in the pool.
[10062.07s -> 10064.23s]  Yeah, you got to jump in the pool after.
[10064.87s -> 10079.96s]  It's Hector.
[10079.96s -> 10080.44s]  What are you doing?
[10082.04s -> 10083.82s]  This is for Rage.
[10083.82s -> 10085.58s]  How did you find my secret entrance?
[10086.14s -> 10087.34s]  You call that a secret?
[10088.22s -> 10089.26s]  It was supposed to be.
[10090.06s -> 10091.02s]  You're out of luck, though.
[10094.63s -> 10095.51s]  He hurt his leg.
[10095.51s -> 10096.39s]  You're going to have to put him down.
[10099.11s -> 10100.31s]  I think one of us is going to have to carry him.
[10105.77s -> 10107.38s]  He won't give a shit.
[10114.04s -> 10114.92s]  There's a lot of choices.
[10114.92s -> 10115.40s]  Which one?
[10117.59s -> 10118.39s]  I'll be back soon.
[10118.39s -> 10119.91s]  It sounded like a conversation under.
[10122.87s -> 10123.51s]  It did, yeah.
[10126.01s -> 10129.45s]  I gather we have to go loot like he was sent to go do a thing,
[10129.45s -> 10132.49s]  but he hurt his leg and he's going to get put down like a horse and he can't do it.
[10132.49s -> 10134.09s]  So we have to go do it for him.
[10134.09s -> 10136.09s]  And then like he's going to get the credit.
[10136.09s -> 10139.27s]  We're not supposed to go this way.
[10139.83s -> 10140.79s]  Yeah, the other way.
[10140.79s -> 10141.75s]  You have a knack for that.
[10142.31s -> 10145.11s]  I just I see arrows that are on the ground and I look at them.
[10145.83s -> 10150.63s]  You're going to send that guy to the glue factory.
[10154.94s -> 10163.35s]  Now, how did I hear these guys?
[10163.35s -> 10164.15s]  I tripped me.
[10165.85s -> 10166.65s]  You want to listen to them?
[10171.90s -> 10172.54s]  The same guy.
[10173.42s -> 10174.46s]  I think there's there's talking.
[10177.42s -> 10179.82s]  Like, is it really normal for you?
[10183.18s -> 10185.96s]  Are they going to notice him fall?
[10185.96s -> 10186.52s]  No, they're not.
[10190.65s -> 10192.57s]  I think I helped.
[10193.61s -> 10198.63s]  You fall in.
[10198.71s -> 10200.55s]  You're doing it.
[10200.55s -> 10208.87s]  Oh, OK, we got distracted.
[10209.98s -> 10212.14s]  You want to just like just get distracted.
[10212.14s -> 10214.54s]  You want to just like wander where we're doing quests.
[10214.54s -> 10215.82s]  I mean, we're already on this quest.
[10215.82s -> 10216.62s]  Let's just finish this one.
[10217.34s -> 10221.86s]  OK, I just want to, you know, go to some dangerous locales
[10221.86s -> 10225.78s]  and find some, you know, interesting go down in the metro.
[10226.42s -> 10227.94s]  Find out what's going on there.
[10227.94s -> 10229.06s]  What's with all these zombies?
[10229.86s -> 10230.66s]  I don't know what is with it.
[10230.66s -> 10231.22s]  It's crazy.
[10232.65s -> 10234.09s]  Like no one's talking about this.
[10236.66s -> 10243.00s]  No one's even talking about this happening everywhere we go.
[10243.00s -> 10246.28s]  It's like, oh, go over here and pick up my supplies like zombies.
[10246.28s -> 10247.16s]  No one's going to.
[10247.16s -> 10247.48s]  Wow.
[10248.44s -> 10249.00s]  See you later.
[10250.12s -> 10258.66s]  OK, 59 meters.
[10266.52s -> 10267.88s]  Inhibitor container detected.
[10267.88s -> 10270.63s]  Oh, inhibitor.
[10271.35s -> 10273.93s]  That's going to be in that zone.
[10275.53s -> 10279.45s]  Why isn't anyone talking about this with 200,000 tweets?
[10279.45s -> 10285.53s]  It's this is this is totally the mission from Dying Light one
[10285.53s -> 10287.69s]  where we go down there, open the garage door
[10287.69s -> 10289.53s]  and the big tyrant is going to show up.
[10289.53s -> 10290.25s]  Oh, it is.
[10290.81s -> 10291.29s]  You're right.
[10297.21s -> 10298.49s]  But they do it twice, though.
[10299.82s -> 10307.24s]  What they do is fucking guys will do anything.
[10309.56s -> 10310.44s]  Who made this game?
[10313.21s -> 10313.85s]  Who made this game?
[10315.83s -> 10320.55s]  I rent tech tech land.
[10320.55s -> 10320.79s]  Yeah.
[10321.61s -> 10322.73s]  What else is tech land made?
[10324.87s -> 10325.67s]  They made Dying Light.
[10326.71s -> 10327.83s]  Besides that, obviously.
[10330.02s -> 10331.06s]  I need you to help.
[10331.86s -> 10333.30s]  I did it.
[10333.30s -> 10336.98s]  No, I swear that was when I was them.
[10341.85s -> 10343.02s]  You guys need help.
[10343.58s -> 10344.38s]  We'll be fine.
[10344.38s -> 10345.26s]  Thanks.
[10345.26s -> 10345.82s]  What happened?
[10346.55s -> 10350.47s]  We heard a rumor about the pirate.
[10350.47s -> 10351.75s]  It's just two other players.
[10354.31s -> 10356.15s]  When we're like pretending not to be in the same game.
[10358.58s -> 10359.46s]  We're going down.
[10367.06s -> 10367.86s]  Trash doesn't hurt either.
[10368.42s -> 10373.32s]  You can go down, too.
[10375.90s -> 10377.18s]  Yeah, there's nothing here.
[10377.18s -> 10378.22s]  Looks like we're going down.
[10379.50s -> 10384.31s]  Elevator.
[10384.31s -> 10384.79s]  All right, cool.
[10388.57s -> 10389.69s]  We should turn off the generator.
[10397.32s -> 10398.04s]  Why did we do that?
[10400.68s -> 10401.96s]  That just gave us a problem.
[10406.60s -> 10407.40s]  Okay, you go first.
[10407.40s -> 10408.20s]  I got your back.
[10408.20s -> 10408.92s]  All right, I'm going first.
[10412.04s -> 10413.08s]  Owler, straight ahead.
[10422.57s -> 10424.41s]  I could find the GRE container.
[10430.04s -> 10432.98s]  Easy, easy.
[10432.98s -> 10433.78s]  You're aggroing.
[10434.42s -> 10436.23s]  Am I?
[10436.23s -> 10437.03s]  You're aggroed him.
[10438.60s -> 10439.56s]  What are you talking about?
[10439.56s -> 10440.36s]  You're aggroed him.
[10445.82s -> 10447.90s]  You're doing fake E3 gamer trailer.
[10447.90s -> 10448.46s]  No, we're not.
[10449.18s -> 10449.66s]  Oh, my God.
[10449.66s -> 10450.38s]  I'm aggroing him.
[10450.38s -> 10450.94s]  I'm the tank.
[10450.94s -> 10451.74s]  You're aggroing.
[10452.30s -> 10453.26s]  You're aggroing.
[10453.26s -> 10453.98s]  Let's walk away.
[10454.94s -> 10456.38s]  Uh-oh, we're aggroing.
[10456.38s -> 10457.66s]  There's a dude right here.
[10457.66s -> 10458.30s]  You aggroed.
[10460.06s -> 10465.08s]  It's time to run.
[10465.08s -> 10465.96s]  The Zeds see us.
[10466.84s -> 10467.48s]  There's no time.
[10468.20s -> 10470.34s]  Why would you hit the howler?
[10471.06s -> 10472.54s]  So he doesn't howl.
[10474.49s -> 10475.37s]  Oh, shit.
[10475.37s -> 10480.81s]  Except we gotta go.
[10480.81s -> 10481.77s]  Watch out.
[10481.77s -> 10482.81s]  Horde's coming.
[10482.81s -> 10484.81s]  Oh, my fucking heart is beating so fast.
[10485.53s -> 10487.29s]  There's monsters and shit everywhere.
[10487.29s -> 10488.97s]  Player number two up the stairs.
[10488.97s -> 10489.53s]  Come on, hurry.
[10489.53s -> 10490.01s]  Go, go, go.
[10490.01s -> 10491.77s]  My fucking heart is racing, dude.
[10491.77s -> 10492.27s]  Jesus.
[10493.53s -> 10494.97s]  Let's clear this out real quick.
[10494.97s -> 10496.33s]  We need to save them.
[10496.33s -> 10496.97s]  I need to stop.
[10496.97s -> 10497.77s]  I have to stop for a second.
[10498.73s -> 10499.69s]  Fucking God.
[10500.65s -> 10501.29s]  It's intense.
[10501.29s -> 10502.73s]  Stop for one second, man.
[10502.73s -> 10503.37s]  You need a heal?
[10504.09s -> 10504.65s]  I got you.
[10504.65s -> 10505.53s]  Let's patch you back up.
[10507.66s -> 10508.14s]  Thanks, man.
[10509.02s -> 10509.42s]  Jeez.
[10509.42s -> 10511.35s]  That's my last one.
[10511.35s -> 10512.07s]  Oh, shit, man.
[10512.07s -> 10512.95s]  My light.
[10512.95s -> 10514.76s]  My light's flickering out.
[10514.76s -> 10515.08s]  What?
[10515.88s -> 10516.60s]  I can't see a thing.
[10516.60s -> 10517.40s]  Oh, man.
[10518.04s -> 10518.68s]  Oh, man.
[10519.72s -> 10520.76s]  Okay, guys.
[10522.38s -> 10523.82s]  I can't see either, man.
[10523.82s -> 10524.62s]  I can't see either.
[10525.26s -> 10526.52s]  It could be one anywhere.
[10529.05s -> 10529.53s]  I sneezed.
[10529.53s -> 10530.33s]  It turns it back on.
[10532.97s -> 10534.09s]  There's a volatile down here.
[10534.09s -> 10534.57s]  We're doomed.
[10536.34s -> 10537.30s]  Oh, what's all this goop?
[10538.46s -> 10538.86s]  Guy?
[10538.86s -> 10539.18s]  God.
[10540.14s -> 10540.54s]  Guy.
[10540.54s -> 10541.34s]  I think he's dead, man.
[10541.34s -> 10541.90s]  I think he's dead.
[10541.90s -> 10542.54s]  I think he's dead.
[10543.34s -> 10543.98s]  Yeah, he is now.
[10544.70s -> 10545.82s]  Yeah, I took the assassin perk.
[10545.82s -> 10546.38s]  Oh, my God.
[10546.38s -> 10547.34s]  Watch out.
[10547.34s -> 10548.22s]  Ow, my heart.
[10548.22s -> 10549.26s]  My fucking body hurts.
[10549.26s -> 10550.86s]  That was so fucked up.
[10550.86s -> 10552.22s]  He just touched you, grabbed you.
[10553.02s -> 10554.18s]  Kill him.
[10554.18s -> 10554.90s]  Kill him.
[10554.90s -> 10555.30s]  Kill him.
[10556.90s -> 10557.46s]  All right.
[10557.46s -> 10558.26s]  I don't know, dude.
[10558.26s -> 10558.58s]  I think...
[10560.10s -> 10561.78s]  Can we play Mario or something?
[10561.78s -> 10562.66s]  You gonna be okay, man?
[10563.99s -> 10565.51s]  Can we play Mario Kart or something, dude?
[10565.51s -> 10566.71s]  I don't think I can do this.
[10566.71s -> 10568.86s]  This isn't a game.
[10571.62s -> 10572.26s]  I think he's gonna explode.
[10572.26s -> 10572.74s]  Don't hit those.
[10572.74s -> 10573.30s]  Don't hit those.
[10579.24s -> 10579.56s]  Sorry.
[10579.56s -> 10580.04s]  I'm sorry.
[10581.24s -> 10583.48s]  I was so confused because it was moving around
[10583.48s -> 10585.00s]  but not spraying on my screen.
[10586.30s -> 10588.14s]  It was just like doing a worm move.
[10588.14s -> 10588.62s]  Okay.
[10588.62s -> 10588.86s]  Okay.
[10589.90s -> 10591.10s]  Where's the GRE container?
[10591.10s -> 10591.42s]  It's all right.
[10591.42s -> 10592.54s]  We'll turn on the generator.
[10592.54s -> 10593.26s]  Get some light in here.
[10598.97s -> 10599.29s]  Nice.
[10599.29s -> 10600.89s]  Oh, cool.
[10600.89s -> 10602.92s]  There's his dead in there.
[10603.56s -> 10604.52s]  Oh, container.
[10605.96s -> 10606.68s]  This is the room we...
[10607.40s -> 10608.54s]  This is where we came from.
[10608.54s -> 10608.86s]  That's on the...
[10609.42s -> 10615.74s]  Watch out.
[10615.74s -> 10616.30s]  I'll get this loop.
[10618.17s -> 10618.97s]  Oh, shit.
[10618.97s -> 10619.45s]  Not again.
[10619.45s -> 10620.17s]  We're gonna have to run.
[10621.61s -> 10622.73s]  I don't want to do that again.
[10623.29s -> 10625.05s]  I don't want to do the acting routine again.
[10625.69s -> 10627.45s]  We need to find the container.
[10627.45s -> 10631.96s]  Which way are we going?
[10631.96s -> 10632.76s]  Are we going down this way?
[10633.32s -> 10634.44s]  I don't know.
[10634.44s -> 10635.32s]  We have to find one of those things.
[10635.32s -> 10635.72s]  Watch your back.
[10638.52s -> 10639.80s]  The indicator didn't beep yet.
[10639.80s -> 10641.72s]  I think this is the military storage area
[10641.72s -> 10642.60s]  Hubert told me about.
[10642.60s -> 10644.28s]  Yeah, it's down here in secret.
[10644.28s -> 10646.06s]  Okay.
[10646.06s -> 10646.54s]  I'm going.
[10647.26s -> 10649.69s]  I'm a runner.
[10649.69s -> 10653.46s]  Are you actually just running through this?
[10653.46s -> 10654.10s]  Yeah, I'm a runner.
[10655.62s -> 10656.58s]  Fucking idiot.
[10659.78s -> 10661.06s]  Call it next time then.
[10661.06s -> 10661.70s]  Call it now.
[10661.70s -> 10662.82s]  I don't want to be fucking mad, dude.
[10662.82s -> 10664.18s]  But call it next time.
[10664.18s -> 10664.82s]  I called it.
[10664.82s -> 10665.54s]  I don't know where to go.
[10666.26s -> 10666.98s]  Dead end, bro.
[10667.54s -> 10673.77s]  Fucking dead end, bro.
[10674.57s -> 10675.13s]  Through here.
[10675.13s -> 10675.69s]  Through here.
[10675.69s -> 10677.21s]  Go through the fucking door.
[10677.21s -> 10678.33s]  God damn it, man.
[10678.33s -> 10678.89s]  This way.
[10678.89s -> 10679.37s]  Up here.
[10679.37s -> 10680.81s]  Not playing games with you again.
[10680.81s -> 10681.85s]  Oh, my...
[10681.85s -> 10685.69s]  This isn't funny, bro.
[10688.20s -> 10688.92s]  Help me.
[10688.92s -> 10689.40s]  Watch my back.
[10689.40s -> 10690.44s]  I'm turning on the lights.
[10690.44s -> 10690.94s]  Yeah.
[10692.42s -> 10694.26s]  Nah, I'm just not fucking gonna play a game with you anymore.
[10698.92s -> 10700.60s]  Go play fucking COD, you fucking idiot.
[10703.37s -> 10703.77s]  Oh, wait.
[10703.77s -> 10704.57s]  You're locked the guy.
[10704.57s -> 10705.45s]  I need you.
[10705.45s -> 10705.85s]  Hey.
[10705.85s -> 10706.17s]  Yep.
[10706.17s -> 10706.65s]  I'm on it.
[10707.45s -> 10708.23s]  Drops up.
[10708.79s -> 10719.50s]  I got it.
[10719.50s -> 10719.90s]  Stop.
[10724.74s -> 10725.46s]  Oh, coffee.
[10726.60s -> 10727.48s]  Oh, Cheetos.
[10728.76s -> 10729.48s]  Roaty vest.
[10731.38s -> 10732.42s]  Cheetos.
[10732.42s -> 10732.90s]  Chicken.
[10734.02s -> 10736.42s]  Yeah, how did they not put any of that back in this game?
[10737.96s -> 10739.48s]  We've been playing for like two hours.
[10739.48s -> 10741.48s]  I haven't seen one coffee, Cheetos, or chicken.
[10742.04s -> 10745.62s]  Because I don't think any of those items are actually in the game.
[10747.45s -> 10748.65s]  Coffee was.
[10748.65s -> 10749.61s]  Was it?
[10749.61s -> 10750.49s]  It was.
[10750.57s -> 10751.37s]  Yes.
[10751.37s -> 10753.64s]  Oh, we got a box.
[10753.64s -> 10755.96s]  But you're acting like they were Cheetos in the game?
[10755.96s -> 10757.08s]  There were no Cheetos.
[10757.08s -> 10758.68s]  There was no Cheetos, but there was coffee.
[10758.68s -> 10760.60s]  And we haven't seen coffee yet, and I'm upset.
[10766.23s -> 10768.79s]  You said we weren't going to do the bit unless you found it.
[10770.18s -> 10771.14s]  Well, we're not going to find it.
[10772.36s -> 10773.16s]  You're just giving up.
[10777.98s -> 10778.62s]  No.
[10778.62s -> 10779.42s]  I thought that was coffee.
[10779.42s -> 10780.46s]  It looks like extra gold.
[10780.46s -> 10784.71s]  A bottle of risen glory cognac and some cigars.
[10784.71s -> 10785.91s]  Cubans, the box says.
[10785.91s -> 10786.79s]  Some cigars?
[10786.79s -> 10787.91s]  Yeah, some cigars.
[10788.95s -> 10792.46s]  Well, we have all this stuff here.
[10792.46s -> 10792.70s]  OK.
[10793.90s -> 10794.14s]  Yeah.
[10794.14s -> 10795.10s]  Do you have a heal, bro?
[10795.66s -> 10796.89s]  Of course I got a heal.
[10797.45s -> 10807.32s]  You know, I've been crafting healing items.
[10807.88s -> 10809.08s]  I don't have any of the stuff.
[10812.06s -> 10813.50s]  Oh, there's still a few more somewhere.
[10816.50s -> 10820.89s]  Oh, we're searching containers.
[10821.61s -> 10822.82s]  There's a lot of stuff over there.
[10824.02s -> 10824.58s]  I see.
[10827.14s -> 10829.38s]  I'm hacking in with my hack stick.
[10832.09s -> 10834.25s]  I do like the idea of a hack stick.
[10834.25s -> 10834.81s]  I think it's cool.
[10836.41s -> 10837.53s]  Oh, we got a hammer.
[10838.33s -> 10840.81s]  Yeah, I like I like a hack stick, but I think it's way cooler if you like.
[10841.29s -> 10845.29s]  On like the end of an arrow and then you shoot it into a USB port.
[10846.58s -> 10848.74s]  Obviously, it would never go in right the first way.
[10848.74s -> 10851.14s]  It would bounce off because you didn't have it the right way.
[10851.14s -> 10852.10s]  Like all USB sticks.
[10853.30s -> 10854.42s]  And then you shoot it a second time.
[10855.51s -> 10856.55s]  I can't open that box.
[10857.51s -> 10861.91s]  Hey, bro.
[10861.91s -> 10863.11s]  Oh, man, dude, it's bad.
[10863.11s -> 10880.25s]  It was such an enormous joke.
[10880.81s -> 10886.63s]  Nobody said that.
[10886.63s -> 10886.95s]  I did.
[10889.82s -> 10893.98s]  What's with these fake boxes where it's only like an inch deep?
[10893.98s -> 10898.57s]  Yeah, it's almost like this.
[10899.29s -> 10901.13s]  It's like this is a magic trick case.
[10902.14s -> 10903.42s]  Yeah, the body's in the bottom.
[10904.30s -> 10905.74s]  The real thing is underneath.
[10905.74s -> 10907.02s]  You open it, then you close it.
[10907.02s -> 10909.82s]  You press the magic button that lifts this too.
[10909.82s -> 10911.42s]  And then the other thing is in there.
[10911.42s -> 10913.10s]  Are you really giving away the whole trick?
[10914.58s -> 10916.58s]  Yeah, that's like that's how it works.
[10917.38s -> 10918.18s]  That's not cool.
[10919.50s -> 10920.54s]  Did I just turn that offer on?
[10922.10s -> 10922.66s]  It was on.
[10924.50s -> 10926.90s]  We're looking for we got to search one more box.
[10926.90s -> 10928.50s]  Wait, was this it?
[10929.22s -> 10931.22s]  OK, we got it.
[10931.22s -> 10933.22s]  Apparently, we got everything of value.
[10933.22s -> 10933.70s]  Nice.
[10933.70s -> 10934.58s]  Time to head out of here.
[10937.70s -> 10940.98s]  Oh, you you you really need some DSing on that, bro.
[10944.22s -> 10947.64s]  OK, bro, we just climb over here.
[10948.95s -> 10949.51s]  That hurt me.
[10950.74s -> 10951.54s]  Did it?
[10951.54s -> 10953.43s]  And they do things, Bob.
[10953.43s -> 10956.39s]  Yep, there's like you made it until you jump.
[10957.11s -> 10959.58s]  But how did you make it over?
[10959.58s -> 10960.22s]  I don't know.
[10960.22s -> 10960.78s]  I did the skip.
[10963.08s -> 10963.80s]  Oh, OK, I got it.
[10968.92s -> 10969.96s]  Oh, back other way.
[10970.68s -> 10973.42s]  Oh, we got to move this.
[10974.30s -> 10976.06s]  Oh, my God.
[10976.06s -> 10977.18s]  It's like a piece of wood.
[10979.26s -> 10980.22s]  Get over it, Aiden.
[10981.58s -> 10982.46s]  He's a plywood.
[10983.50s -> 10984.62s]  Do you know how they make plywood?
[10985.26s -> 10987.66s]  From wood?
[10988.38s -> 10992.94s]  They spin a tree like they shave a tree really thinly
[10992.94s -> 10995.50s]  and they mush all the pieces together that they shave
[10995.50s -> 10996.70s]  with like water and stuff and glue.
[10997.50s -> 11007.18s]  OK, I'm hearing ghosts.
[11008.22s -> 11011.38s]  I think we can leave.
[11011.38s -> 11014.58s]  This game is fun.
[11015.90s -> 11016.40s]  Pirates.
[11017.18s -> 11018.74s]  Did you find the stash?
[11019.46s -> 11020.34s]  Sure did.
[11020.34s -> 11021.86s]  Thanks for the lockpicks.
[11021.86s -> 11023.88s]  But what are you still doing here?
[11024.52s -> 11025.16s]  Is this him?
[11025.80s -> 11026.30s]  Sure is.
[11026.84s -> 11028.52s]  He was kind enough to get the goods for us.
[11029.40s -> 11030.92s]  Saved us a lot of trouble.
[11030.92s -> 11031.48s]  Very good.
[11032.20s -> 11034.12s]  So he's got a fanny pack.
[11038.84s -> 11040.68s]  Well, it's cool now like Kanye brought it back.
[11041.32s -> 11041.96s]  I'm just kidding.
[11041.96s -> 11042.36s]  I don't care.
[11043.32s -> 11044.84s]  You should care about fashion.
[11044.84s -> 11046.28s]  And now we don't need you.
[11046.84s -> 11049.08s]  So do we get counted?
[11050.22s -> 11052.06s]  More people keep coming on from stage.
[11052.06s -> 11052.86s]  Oh, wait, do we fight?
[11052.86s -> 11054.06s]  Do we do a little shit?
[11054.06s -> 11055.10s]  Oh, my God.
[11055.10s -> 11056.79s]  I counted.
[11056.79s -> 11057.59s]  Five corpses.
[11057.59s -> 11058.31s]  Five corpses.
[11058.31s -> 11059.83s]  Kill him and take the goods.
[11059.83s -> 11060.47s]  Oh, kill him.
[11061.11s -> 11062.07s]  Five corpses.
[11062.07s -> 11063.03s]  I thought that was in the game.
[11063.03s -> 11064.31s]  I thought that was one of those people here.
[11066.10s -> 11067.14s]  I'm going to get you.
[11068.26s -> 11069.46s]  Hey, how are we going to do this?
[11069.46s -> 11070.50s]  What tactical way are we going to?
[11083.08s -> 11085.08s]  Oh, yeah, you can't block power attacks.
[11085.08s -> 11085.88s]  I'm down.
[11085.88s -> 11086.38s]  Are you dead?
[11087.40s -> 11087.90s]  Yeah.
[11089.37s -> 11090.97s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[11090.97s -> 11091.77s]  Just hide on the truck.
[11092.57s -> 11094.12s]  How much health do you have?
[11094.12s -> 11094.84s]  How much time do you have?
[11100.12s -> 11100.76s]  Oh, my God.
[11100.76s -> 11101.24s]  Blow this up.
[11107.22s -> 11109.24s]  I got you.
[11110.42s -> 11111.14s]  Let's go.
[11111.14s -> 11112.50s]  Let's get this going.
[11112.50s -> 11113.00s]  Come on.
[11113.86s -> 11114.36s]  Watch out.
[11115.38s -> 11121.67s]  He's just taking it.
[11121.67s -> 11122.39s]  He's just taking it.
[11123.27s -> 11124.63s]  His head is thick.
[11133.58s -> 11135.02s]  He just popped him up.
[11135.02s -> 11136.22s]  Like we were on a trampoline.
[11136.22s -> 11137.02s]  What the fuck was that?
[11140.54s -> 11151.32s]  Wings.
[11154.38s -> 11162.26s]  You do these gigantic swings with two-handed swords in this game
[11162.26s -> 11162.98s]  and the person's head just spins.
[11162.98s -> 11164.34s]  Why do these guys have so many?
[11164.34s -> 11165.46s]  OK, I'm taking out two-hander too.
[11165.46s -> 11166.26s]  Two-hander versus two-hander.
[11171.99s -> 11172.63s]  I'm on the map.
[11175.10s -> 11178.65s]  How much health does this guy have?
[11180.57s -> 11191.88s]  I don't have any health potions left.
[11191.88s -> 11192.68s]  Well, whatever they are.
[11193.56s -> 11194.79s]  Hold on, mate.
[11194.79s -> 11195.35s]  Time out.
[11195.35s -> 11195.75s]  Time out.
[11195.75s -> 11196.07s]  Time out.
[11196.07s -> 11196.87s]  Time out.
[11196.87s -> 11197.37s]  Time out.
[11200.31s -> 11208.99s]  Damn.
[11208.99s -> 11209.45s]  Are we?
[11209.45s -> 11211.53s]  Why was this taking us so long?
[11211.53s -> 11212.09s]  I don't know.
[11212.09s -> 11214.97s]  Because our weapons are made out of duct tape, maybe?
[11219.90s -> 11221.50s]  There might be health in that box to your left.
[11223.61s -> 11224.81s]  He didn't even come close.
[11224.81s -> 11225.69s]  What was that hitbox?
[11229.62s -> 11231.94s]  He just berserker whirlwinded.
[11234.10s -> 11234.74s]  Take one of these.
[11235.46s -> 11236.58s]  I can't even look over there.
[11241.62s -> 11244.02s]  You are off-camera fighting these people.
[11244.02s -> 11244.58s]  I'm coming in.
[11244.58s -> 11245.62s]  I'm coming into camera.
[11245.62s -> 11248.26s]  I'm just waiting for a body to fly across the screen.
[11262.98s -> 11264.02s]  I feel like we're LARPing.
[11264.58s -> 11267.22s]  And I'm really disappointed right now because I feel like that sucks.
[11267.22s -> 11270.34s]  I came here, I dressed up, I brought my huge sword that I had crafted.
[11270.98s -> 11272.66s]  And somebody tagged me in the leg and it was like,
[11272.66s -> 11273.06s]  Dad!
[11273.06s -> 11274.02s]  And it's like, come on, dude.
[11274.02s -> 11275.62s]  Really, I get to watch the cool part now.
[11278.86s -> 11279.34s]  I got you.
[11281.48s -> 11282.68s]  Like, I have to watch you do that.
[11282.68s -> 11284.78s]  They're not going to stop me.
[11284.78s -> 11285.74s]  Get up, buddy.
[11285.74s -> 11286.14s]  You're fine.
[11286.78s -> 11288.14s]  You're going to stop fucking crying about it.
[11289.02s -> 11291.11s]  I take this right out of the pocket.
[11296.50s -> 11299.22s]  Yeah, you missed, by the way.
[11302.47s -> 11305.70s]  There's something in this chest.
[11309.02s -> 11313.00s]  I love when they have like a stream of blood coming out of their body.
[11313.00s -> 11313.96s]  Yeah, that was weird.
[11313.96s -> 11315.40s]  Like, snakes just came out of them.
[11317.96s -> 11326.07s]  Okay, honestly, God, why is it taking so long?
[11327.03s -> 11327.99s]  There's a skeleton here.
[11332.02s -> 11332.58s]  I'm in pain.
[11333.62s -> 11336.66s]  He's coming up behind you.
[11337.30s -> 11341.64s]  I got a new weapon.
[11342.20s -> 11343.48s]  What is it?
[11344.89s -> 11345.45s]  It's gone.
[11345.45s -> 11346.90s]  No, it's not.
[11346.90s -> 11353.51s]  Where's his weapon?
[11353.51s -> 11353.91s]  What happened?
[11354.87s -> 11357.91s]  What the fuck is happening?
[11357.91s -> 11359.11s]  It's gone.
[11359.11s -> 11359.59s]  What?
[11359.59s -> 11360.63s]  He doesn't have a weapon.
[11360.63s -> 11366.12s]  Where are you, asshole?
[11366.12s -> 11367.24s]  It's gone.
[11374.62s -> 11375.58s]  We are dead here.
[11378.26s -> 11379.78s]  This is a guy in a costume.
[11379.78s -> 11380.98s]  This isn't even a guy.
[11380.98s -> 11381.46s]  I'm dead.
[11382.42s -> 11383.78s]  No, please.
[11385.88s -> 11387.48s]  I couldn't save you, Gascan.
[11388.28s -> 11389.48s]  I don't think he can die now.
[11390.36s -> 11393.08s]  You cut his head off and he just kept swinging.
[11393.08s -> 11394.28s]  Can you pull me to you?
[11395.08s -> 11396.04s]  No, you're dead, man.
[11396.04s -> 11397.00s]  No, I'm alive again.
[11397.00s -> 11397.64s]  Can you pull me?
[11399.85s -> 11400.57s]  No, I can't.
[11401.53s -> 11403.29s]  Are you still running away from that guy?
[11403.29s -> 11404.73s]  He's dancing now.
[11406.26s -> 11406.66s]  Hold on.
[11406.66s -> 11407.22s]  I'm coming to you.
[11414.39s -> 11415.51s]  He thinks I'm invisible.
[11417.43s -> 11418.55s]  I gotta get there quick.
[11419.19s -> 11428.06s]  That was so stupid.
[11428.06s -> 11430.14s]  Okay, on my screen, he didn't have a weapon.
[11430.14s -> 11431.18s]  And then his head came off.
[11431.90s -> 11434.54s]  Yeah, you walked up to the side of him and cut his head off.
[11434.62s -> 11435.66s]  And he dropped his weapon.
[11435.66s -> 11436.78s]  He just started punching at you.
[11436.78s -> 11437.82s]  I thought it was like a...
[11437.82s -> 11441.26s]  I thought the game was doing an actual like chicken headless joke.
[11443.08s -> 11443.48s]  Hold on.
[11443.48s -> 11443.96s]  Keep him there.
[11443.96s -> 11444.60s]  Keep him there.
[11444.60s -> 11445.40s]  We gotta like...
[11445.40s -> 11446.60s]  We gotta take this guy somewhere.
[11447.16s -> 11449.10s]  I'm almost there.
[11449.10s -> 11450.38s]  He's still here.
[11450.38s -> 11452.54s]  I mean, we didn't get the reward for the quest.
[11452.54s -> 11453.02s]  We didn't?
[11453.98s -> 11454.78s]  What's going on here?
[11460.04s -> 11461.00s]  Are you able to get in here?
[11462.44s -> 11463.16s]  I'm in trouble.
[11463.16s -> 11463.48s]  Hold on.
[11465.30s -> 11466.02s]  I ran into...
[11467.06s -> 11469.22s]  Who's playing a clown horn?
[11469.46s -> 11470.10s]  What was that?
[11472.55s -> 11474.23s]  Somebody just like, oh, look at me.
[11475.03s -> 11478.94s]  God damn it.
[11478.94s -> 11479.66s]  Okay, I gotta run.
[11481.16s -> 11481.80s]  You're not far.
[11481.80s -> 11483.00s]  Just come here, man.
[11483.00s -> 11483.56s]  Oh, shit.
[11484.44s -> 11486.52s]  Run, run, run, run, run.
[11486.52s -> 11500.17s]  Yeah, I don't know how you...
[11500.17s -> 11500.97s]  All right, so where is he?
[11506.52s -> 11507.56s]  I can hear him swearing.
[11508.28s -> 11513.38s]  Yeah, he's still talking.
[11520.07s -> 11521.91s]  You motherfucker.
[11523.99s -> 11529.05s]  So what did we do?
[11529.05s -> 11530.33s]  We didn't get the quest reward?
[11530.33s -> 11531.77s]  What are we supposed to do about this?
[11531.77s -> 11534.09s]  I think we're supposed to go turn in the quest to the guy now
[11534.09s -> 11535.37s]  because it's giving me the other marker.
[11536.65s -> 11539.74s]  Okay, well...
[11539.74s -> 11542.30s]  If you press Q, you can still see his head.
[11542.30s -> 11542.78s]  It's there.
[11543.66s -> 11544.70s]  All right, so we can just leave.
[11545.82s -> 11548.71s]  Yeah, he's gonna kill me.
[11551.69s -> 11552.73s]  How are you this good?
[11556.74s -> 11557.54s]  Can we kill him again?
[11560.02s -> 11563.70s]  I don't think we can kill him again.
[11563.70s -> 11564.34s]  Let's go.
[11564.34s -> 11564.74s]  Yeah, run.
[11566.57s -> 11567.61s]  Okay, wrap around here
[11567.61s -> 11569.37s]  because there was like a weird quest with this guy.
[11569.37s -> 11570.97s]  I had like, he was handcuffed.
[11571.69s -> 11574.58s]  Oh, so you want to like go unhandcuff him?
[11574.58s -> 11575.70s]  Yeah, I tried to.
[11575.70s -> 11576.34s]  He's right over here.
[11576.90s -> 11578.26s]  Do the Uwuga thing?
[11578.26s -> 11578.98s]  Yeah, he's over here.
[11587.96s -> 11589.16s]  Okay, they grouped up now.
[11592.10s -> 11599.54s]  Yeah, do it.
[11601.78s -> 11603.90s]  Oh, damn it.
[11603.90s -> 11605.10s]  Another headless guy.
[11605.10s -> 11605.90s]  Oh no, he's staying down.
[11605.90s -> 11606.40s]  Good.
[11607.02s -> 11611.48s]  This guy's holding a foam bat.
[11611.48s -> 11612.36s]  That's not gonna hurt anyway.
[11617.06s -> 11619.56s]  All right, we rescued this guy.
[11620.76s -> 11621.24s]  Excuse me.
[11621.24s -> 11621.72s]  What are you doing?
[11622.60s -> 11624.06s]  I'm doing parkour.
[11624.06s -> 11625.26s]  No, the guy that we rescued.
[11627.26s -> 11629.80s]  Wait, is he trying to fight you?
[11629.80s -> 11630.76s]  Yes, I don't know what happened.
[11632.92s -> 11633.80s]  He's keeper rescued.
[11633.80s -> 11634.28s]  He's mad.
[11634.92s -> 11635.56s]  Wait, is he mad?
[11636.60s -> 11640.22s]  I think he's, he gave up.
[11641.26s -> 11643.50s]  All right, take his head off.
[11649.40s -> 11654.33s]  Take his head.
[11654.33s -> 11658.73s]  We're doing like no damage to him.
[11658.73s -> 11659.61s]  Why can't we hurt him?
[11661.05s -> 11662.97s]  I think you might have to like harry these guys
[11662.97s -> 11663.93s]  to get their helmet off.
[11665.77s -> 11672.44s]  He's got a black eye.
[11675.08s -> 11676.60s]  After all that, he has a shiner.
[11677.24s -> 11678.20s]  He's got a black eye.
[11685.32s -> 11685.80s]  Just leave him.
[11686.98s -> 11688.02s]  It's not worth our time.
[11690.07s -> 11697.11s]  Take some money.
[11697.11s -> 11697.91s]  Are we climbing this?
[11698.95s -> 11699.83s]  I like climbing.
[11702.07s -> 11703.46s]  Where are we going?
[11703.46s -> 11704.58s]  He's following you.
[11706.84s -> 11707.32s]  We're going on.
[11707.32s -> 11708.04s]  We're going this way.
[11708.04s -> 11708.44s]  Follow me.
[11708.44s -> 11710.44s]  He's picking up rocks and throwing them at us.
[11711.16s -> 11712.12s]  Yeah, he doesn't like us.
[11712.12s -> 11712.84s]  Let's go.
[11712.84s -> 11713.80s]  Hey, another cop car.
[11714.84s -> 11716.20s]  There's definitely nothing in there.
[11716.20s -> 11716.70s]  Let's go.
[11717.40s -> 11727.85s]  You want to stick to the roots.
[11727.85s -> 11730.33s]  Generally, you want to stick to the roof tops in this game.
[11730.33s -> 11730.97s]  Okay.
[11730.97s -> 11732.57s]  Who has the goofy horn?
[11733.45s -> 11734.57s]  I'm not hearing a horn.
[11734.97s -> 11735.93s]  Am I going crazy?
[11735.93s -> 11737.61s]  You don't hear a goofy horn.
[11737.61s -> 11743.42s]  I don't hear anything in that building.
[11743.42s -> 11746.62s]  I shouldn't have locked back.
[11746.62s -> 11747.50s]  I need lock that guy.
[11748.54s -> 11749.74s]  Oh, you're too far away.
[11749.74s -> 11752.46s]  I guess I'll just do it and you'll be like irrelevant.
[11752.46s -> 11755.83s]  Now you're kind of far right here right now.
[11763.27s -> 11766.06s]  Where's the lock?
[11767.38s -> 11768.02s]  There was this door.
[11768.02s -> 11768.42s]  I opened it.
[11768.42s -> 11769.22s]  There's nothing in here.
[11777.74s -> 11778.38s]  There's a question.
[11778.38s -> 11779.58s]  There's a question mark over here.
[11779.58s -> 11780.78s]  I want to go see the question mark.
[11780.78s -> 11781.28s]  Okay.
[11782.17s -> 11782.73s]  That was dumb.
[11784.73s -> 11785.61s]  Jumping off the roof.
[11785.61s -> 11786.25s]  Oh, you did it too.
[11786.97s -> 11788.81s]  I've made it, I guess.
[11794.75s -> 11797.07s]  I need to craft heals.
[11799.37s -> 11801.45s]  Apparently, we're supposed to come back at night.
[11802.17s -> 11803.90s]  I'm back at night.
[11804.99s -> 11805.47s]  All right.
[11805.47s -> 11805.79s]  Okay.
[11805.79s -> 11806.11s]  I don't.
[11808.20s -> 11809.16s]  It's a dark zone.
[11810.64s -> 11812.00s]  I don't know.
[11812.00s -> 11818.96s]  Oh, I can unlock far jump or running speed.
[11819.76s -> 11822.64s]  I'll do far jump.
[11823.28s -> 11826.56s]  When you get the cast like fireball.
[11828.52s -> 11831.48s]  So I seriously haven't like we've leveled up like one time.
[11832.20s -> 11834.44s]  Does that just mean we're not doing anything?
[11835.34s -> 11836.70s]  Maybe or we didn't get like the
[11847.05s -> 11848.80s]  About the halftime show.
[11849.52s -> 11852.08s]  I don't what do you want me to say about it?
[11852.08s -> 11853.20s]  I don't I'm not watching it.
[11853.92s -> 11858.64s]  Can you please react?
[11861.55s -> 11866.20s]  We have to actually go find honey.
[11866.20s -> 11869.93s]  Pretty sure we could like go to a place and buy it.
[11871.29s -> 11872.97s]  Yeah, I'm out of healing again.
[11876.20s -> 11876.92s]  Are you kidding me?
[11877.48s -> 11879.16s]  I fell at that last second there.
[11882.25s -> 11882.65s]  React.
[11883.21s -> 11886.32s]  No, I'm not reacting to the Super Bowl halftime show.
[11889.21s -> 11890.01s]  Who's performing?
[11890.57s -> 11891.05s]  I don't know.
[11891.93s -> 11893.21s]  I can react to that.
[11894.32s -> 11896.00s]  Is it fucking Barney again?
[11899.04s -> 11902.08s]  Barney comes on stage and they do like a whole routine with them.
[11902.08s -> 11902.80s]  Yeah.
[11902.80s -> 11905.20s]  Yeah, last year it was Barney and baby Bob.
[11909.84s -> 11910.96s]  I actually would watch that.
[11911.68s -> 11913.37s]  That was the halftime show.
[11914.17s -> 11916.73s]  Why do so many NPCs have this hair?
[11916.73s -> 11919.29s]  Because we keep coming back and talking to the same guy.
[11926.44s -> 11928.28s]  It's not it's a different.
[11928.28s -> 11929.56s]  It's not a different person.
[11929.56s -> 11930.68s]  What are you talking about?
[11934.20s -> 11941.61s]  Oh, that hair is what I don't feel like that hairstyle is always
[11941.61s -> 11944.81s]  selectable in any game that has character customization.
[11944.81s -> 11948.49s]  The just bizarre buzz cut in the wrong spots.
[11948.49s -> 11950.01s]  It's always like number.
[11950.01s -> 11951.69s]  It's only the second row always.
[11952.41s -> 11953.37s]  We got to rescue this guy.
[11957.05s -> 11960.04s]  Yeah, when dropping onto enemy from above.
[11960.60s -> 11962.84s]  He's like, what the fuck just happened?
[11962.84s -> 11964.04s]  He's like, holy shit.
[11964.04s -> 11965.96s]  Wait, you jumped out and died?
[11965.96s -> 11967.64s]  This guy's face is like, oh my God.
[11976.60s -> 11984.33s]  What was that?
[11984.33s -> 11985.29s]  I don't know what's happening.
[11986.01s -> 11988.01s]  Somebody's holding down a piano key.
[11991.74s -> 11993.74s]  He's got a song machine.
[11993.74s -> 11995.82s]  What was that song music maker?
[11998.56s -> 11999.36s]  I want one of those.
[11999.36s -> 12000.48s]  That thing is insane.
[12001.76s -> 12002.88s]  Who is this guy?
[12002.88s -> 12004.40s]  Why does he not have a health bar?
[12005.20s -> 12006.24s]  Where's his health bar?
[12011.37s -> 12013.13s]  This guy doesn't have a health bar, sir.
[12014.01s -> 12014.97s]  The sun's going down.
[12020.25s -> 12023.21s]  No, stop playing the fucking funny music.
[12023.21s -> 12024.33s]  I'm not hearing it.
[12027.53s -> 12028.03s]  Shut up.
[12036.92s -> 12038.12s]  All right, let's help this guy.
[12040.54s -> 12043.10s]  Look at all these homeless people that come off the street.
[12043.10s -> 12044.30s]  Like, oh, there's a fight going on.
[12044.30s -> 12044.94s]  I'm coming in.
[12045.74s -> 12046.24s]  We got him.
[12047.10s -> 12049.76s]  Holy shit, this guy's good.
[12050.48s -> 12051.52s]  Who is this guy?
[12052.32s -> 12056.75s]  I'm doing a 1v1.
[12063.52s -> 12067.60s]  Why does it have a trophy?
[12068.32s -> 12071.48s]  All right, let them 1v1.
[12072.64s -> 12073.20s]  Let them fight it out.
[12073.20s -> 12073.70s]  Let them fight.
[12074.64s -> 12075.14s]  Okay.
[12075.92s -> 12076.96s]  There's zombies coming.
[12077.92s -> 12080.48s]  I have no healing.
[12080.48s -> 12081.20s]  No, no.
[12081.20s -> 12082.24s]  What the fuck, dude?
[12083.12s -> 12085.53s]  I've had enough.
[12085.53s -> 12086.03s]  We gotta go.
[12086.03s -> 12086.53s]  Let's go.
[12093.49s -> 12094.53s]  Can we have a bar and kill him?
[12095.17s -> 12097.14s]  He has a trophy on him.
[12100.37s -> 12101.57s]  Let's finish saving him.
[12102.29s -> 12104.13s]  He's in danger.
[12105.09s -> 12106.40s]  Okay.
[12106.78s -> 12108.19s]  Does he, like, talk to us?
[12110.27s -> 12110.75s]  Oh, yeah.
[12110.75s -> 12112.11s]  I could, like, take it from him.
[12112.11s -> 12113.07s]  Take the trophy from him?
[12113.07s -> 12113.71s]  Okay, get it.
[12114.35s -> 12114.85s]  I got it.
[12115.47s -> 12116.11s]  How do I get it?
[12116.11s -> 12116.59s]  I can't get it.
[12116.59s -> 12117.23s]  I can't take anything.
[12118.75s -> 12120.19s]  That probably hurt so bad.
[12121.07s -> 12123.30s]  All right, here.
[12123.30s -> 12123.94s]  Thanks for the help.
[12124.74s -> 12130.30s]  Okay, let's go.
[12131.66s -> 12132.14s]  Rooftops.
[12132.14s -> 12132.64s]  We're in trouble.
[12135.15s -> 12135.65s]  Are we?
[12136.19s -> 12137.39s]  I don't feel threatened.
[12138.11s -> 12148.30s]  Somebody just called me Original Sin Andy.
[12149.02s -> 12153.07s]  Well, like, I haven't been baptized.
[12153.07s -> 12154.67s]  What the fuck is that message?
[12154.67s -> 12155.47s]  What is that comment?
[12156.27s -> 12157.55s]  Divinity Original Sin?
[12158.27s -> 12158.77s]  Good game.
[12159.31s -> 12162.66s]  This guy's gonna be a fruit.
[12167.68s -> 12172.03s]  Okay.
[12172.03s -> 12173.74s]  Can we eat those?
[12173.74s -> 12179.54s]  What did you do?
[12179.54s -> 12180.74s]  I threw a coin at his head.
[12183.78s -> 12184.42s]  He's on the run.
[12184.42s -> 12184.92s]  He's running.
[12185.80s -> 12186.76s]  Running for his life.
[12188.44s -> 12191.40s]  He's guilty of something.
[12192.85s -> 12193.35s]  What the fuck?
[12193.97s -> 12194.47s]  Like, he just...
[12195.81s -> 12197.25s]  He was just eating an apple.
[12197.25s -> 12198.13s]  He didn't even do anything.
[12198.13s -> 12198.77s]  You're a dick.
[12199.41s -> 12200.53s]  All right, quest is this way.
[12201.25s -> 12206.20s]  Let's go.
[12206.20s -> 12208.24s]  You gotta stop fooling around.
[12208.88s -> 12211.25s]  How are we ever gonna get the antidote?
[12212.24s -> 12212.96s]  Oh, wait, nighttime.
[12212.96s -> 12213.52s]  Let's go in here.
[12213.52s -> 12214.32s]  This was the place.
[12214.32s -> 12215.20s]  Oh, that's right.
[12215.20s -> 12215.70s]  You're right.
[12216.24s -> 12216.80s]  I'll watch out.
[12216.80s -> 12218.08s]  There's a, there's a scorcher.
[12218.72s -> 12222.53s]  I'd be careful in here.
[12223.17s -> 12224.77s]  Oh, there's one right there.
[12224.77s -> 12230.72s]  You don't want to alert him.
[12230.72s -> 12234.08s]  You wouldn't want to start playing the sound machine right now.
[12237.44s -> 12238.16s]  I think one person.
[12239.52s -> 12245.54s]  Oh, there's one more.
[12245.54s -> 12246.58s]  Sorry, I got it wrong.
[12246.58s -> 12247.30s]  One more person.
[12248.82s -> 12252.50s]  My zombie powers are showing that there's a lot of enemies in here.
[12256.40s -> 12258.56s]  Some of them in coats, some of them in pants.
[12260.92s -> 12261.56s]  I'm not seeing it.
[12263.16s -> 12265.48s]  I'm like an 800 on my experience here.
[12266.28s -> 12267.00s]  Are you actually?
[12267.00s -> 12267.50s]  Okay.
[12267.74s -> 12269.98s]  I feel like I'm starting to see a lot of the game and it's,
[12270.62s -> 12271.98s]  I've seen a lot of the same, you know?
[12271.98s -> 12274.30s]  So I feel like my experience meter is actually going up.
[12274.30s -> 12275.58s]  So you're, how far are you at the?
[12276.94s -> 12278.06s]  800 out of a thousand.
[12279.30s -> 12280.58s]  I'll say 823.
[12281.86s -> 12283.14s]  Nice round number.
[12283.14s -> 12283.46s]  You know what?
[12283.46s -> 12283.94s]  I'll be honest.
[12283.94s -> 12286.58s]  I'm probably getting kind of close too to be able to say that as well.
[12290.46s -> 12290.94s]  Blades.
[12300.82s -> 12301.38s]  You're gonna be.
[12301.38s -> 12302.34s]  Lock back guy.
[12302.34s -> 12303.06s]  Lock back guy.
[12303.78s -> 12306.38s]  We got some big loot in here.
[12306.38s -> 12306.94s]  This is odd.
[12312.34s -> 12312.98s]  I know where it is.
[12312.98s -> 12313.70s]  Don't worry.
[12313.70s -> 12319.93s]  I, what happened?
[12321.94s -> 12322.50s]  He fell over.
[12325.46s -> 12326.18s]  You're a bit silly.
[12326.18s -> 12327.22s]  You're doing some ditzy stuff.
[12332.52s -> 12333.40s]  Oh, you fuck.
[12333.96s -> 12336.02s]  That's right there.
[12336.02s -> 12336.58s]  A little bit more.
[12340.95s -> 12341.45s]  Ooh.
[12343.03s -> 12343.53s]  Urgent.
[12345.74s -> 12353.77s]  So, uh, from the last game, you just carried UV lights around with you.
[12353.77s -> 12357.13s]  And then the zombies went, I think you can, you can make them.
[12357.93s -> 12358.81s]  Oh, can you?
[12358.81s -> 12360.41s]  That makes a lot of sense.
[12360.41s -> 12364.09s]  I feel like everyone should just be covered in UV lights.
[12364.09s -> 12367.05s]  Like a RGB keyboard kind of situation.
[12367.77s -> 12369.85s]  This whole thing wouldn't really be a problem anymore.
[12370.89s -> 12372.09s]  Why are we getting intense music?
[12373.80s -> 12375.80s]  I'm not.
[12375.80s -> 12376.92s]  Oh my, I'm about to die.
[12378.23s -> 12382.09s]  Why?
[12382.09s -> 12384.01s]  There's a UV flashlight in a later mission.
[12384.01s -> 12384.41s]  That's cool.
[12387.32s -> 12388.12s]  That's all it was.
[12388.12s -> 12388.52s]  Let's go.
[12392.57s -> 12395.45s]  We actually could both die very soon here.
[12396.09s -> 12404.17s]  You guys are in the baby zone still because you're not doing any story missions.
[12406.06s -> 12407.26s]  You're stuck in the baby zone.
[12409.46s -> 12410.26s]  What?
[12410.26s -> 12412.07s]  You ran that fast?
[12418.90s -> 12420.26s]  We've been helping though.
[12420.26s -> 12421.30s]  He's been doing it.
[12421.30s -> 12421.94s]  He's been doing it.
[12422.90s -> 12424.10s]  I'm going to go to the craft master.
[12424.74s -> 12425.70s]  I need you all players.
[12428.01s -> 12429.85s]  I can't talk to this guy unless you got my back.
[12430.65s -> 12431.45s]  I'm anxious.
[12433.80s -> 12436.12s]  It's a skyscraper city that you haven't even gotten to.
[12436.12s -> 12437.16s]  You're not even going to get to it.
[12448.90s -> 12449.94s]  Shove up.
[12449.94s -> 12451.30s]  Shove them up your ass.
[12451.30s -> 12454.23s]  Okay.
[12454.23s -> 12458.89s]  That was a side quest.
[12459.85s -> 12462.33s]  We got to do some main story missions.
[12463.29s -> 12465.37s]  I mean, I learned a parkour point.
[12466.65s -> 12467.85s]  Okay.
[12467.85s -> 12471.53s]  So this only get some work at the bazaar and earn Sophie's trust.
[12471.53s -> 12472.41s]  Isn't that what we just did?
[12473.45s -> 12476.63s]  Yeah.
[12476.63s -> 12478.39s]  I guess we just do a job.
[12478.39s -> 12478.63s]  Yeah.
[12478.63s -> 12479.99s]  She doesn't trust us.
[12479.99s -> 12493.82s]  Perfect dodge will stagger an enemy.
[12493.82s -> 12494.70s]  That's cool.
[12494.70s -> 12502.89s]  Okay.
[12502.89s -> 12505.80s]  I'm going to go to the crafting zone.
[12506.44s -> 12513.08s]  I just, I don't even, I just purchased things.
[12513.08s -> 12514.20s]  I'm never going to use them.
[12515.56s -> 12516.92s]  Someone's going to tell me to use them.
[12516.92s -> 12517.88s]  I'm never going to do it.
[12518.60s -> 12519.93s]  I want to craft.
[12524.71s -> 12528.15s]  Oh, it's middle mouse button to upgrade your blueprints.
[12529.48s -> 12529.96s]  By the way.
[12535.77s -> 12536.73s]  I crafted.
[12536.73s -> 12538.15s]  I did it.
[12538.15s -> 12539.03s]  I crafted.
[12539.03s -> 12543.72s]  I did it.
[12543.72s -> 12544.60s]  I figured it out.
[12544.60s -> 12545.24s]  Cool.
[12545.24s -> 12545.88s]  All right.
[12545.88s -> 12547.24s]  So I just got that better.
[12548.12s -> 12548.36s]  Yeah.
[12549.10s -> 12549.50s]  Yeah.
[12549.50s -> 12550.38s]  You did get that better.
[12551.74s -> 12561.88s]  Like a million degrees in here.
[12561.88s -> 12565.32s]  Oh, who's selling the, uh, healing items?
[12565.32s -> 12569.50s]  Anyone got any healing items in here?
[12569.50s -> 12570.46s]  Um, somebody probably does.
[12571.02s -> 12572.06s]  Come back here.
[12572.06s -> 12575.66s]  Oxygen.
[12575.66s -> 12576.94s]  The general shop, I think has them.
[12579.27s -> 12581.27s]  This is fucking losers selling cans.
[12582.07s -> 12586.12s]  Oh, these are nice.
[12589.10s -> 12589.74s]  Get a job.
[12592.68s -> 12593.16s]  Glasses.
[12598.38s -> 12598.54s]  Yeah.
[12598.54s -> 12599.50s]  Just buy all the heals.
[12600.31s -> 12600.71s]  I did.
[12601.35s -> 12603.67s]  I purchased a full stack of healing items.
[12608.71s -> 12611.11s]  Tell all the bullshit that you, all the weapons you're not using either.
[12613.72s -> 12619.11s]  I got to say I'm feeling ready to take on the world.
[12619.11s -> 12620.17s]  This thing's pretty good.
[12620.81s -> 12621.53s]  Antique hammer.
[12622.25s -> 12625.05s]  I'm going to actually do a PP while you do your shopping.
[12625.05s -> 12626.25s]  Oh, we're going to do, we're going to do break.
[12627.29s -> 12630.09s]  If you want to do PP or if you want to like
[12630.09s -> 12631.53s]  pour tea into the toilet or whatever.
[12632.09s -> 12633.53s]  Let's, uh, let's go pee.
[12633.53s -> 12635.83s]  We'll be right back together.
[12635.83s -> 12635.99s]  Yeah.
[12635.99s -> 12637.35s]  Let's make sure we flush at the same time.
[12637.35s -> 12637.83s]  Sink it.
[12637.83s -> 12638.23s]  Okay.
[12638.23s -> 12639.61s]  We'll be right back.
[12639.61s -> 12640.54s]  See you in a minute.
[12640.54s -> 12869.62s]  Oh, I am back.
[12871.16s -> 12872.60s]  I don't think stir is though.
[12872.60s -> 12873.16s]  We'll find out.
[12874.12s -> 12877.74s]  Are you back?
[12878.86s -> 12879.34s]  Oh yeah.
[12879.34s -> 12879.82s]  I'm back.
[12879.82s -> 12880.78s]  All right.
[12880.78s -> 12882.06s]  My war hammer.
[12882.06s -> 12887.10s]  I electricity going through it the whole way.
[12887.10s -> 12890.04s]  Electricity you say, huh?
[12890.60s -> 12890.68s]  Yeah.
[12890.68s -> 12891.56s]  Electricity.
[12892.04s -> 12893.00s]  Pretty cool.
[12893.00s -> 12895.96s]  It's a little bit more practical than just finding a handgun.
[12895.96s -> 12899.00s]  So I wired up my metal hammer with electricity.
[12900.76s -> 12901.64s]  And how did you do that?
[12903.74s -> 12908.78s]  When you press I and you go in your inventory and you click on your weapon.
[12909.34s -> 12909.58s]  Yeah.
[12910.38s -> 12915.18s]  Oh, modify weapon to modify.
[12915.18s -> 12915.34s]  Yeah.
[12915.34s -> 12917.98s]  And if you have the blueprints on the equipment, then you can.
[12917.98s -> 12918.78s]  I don't.
[12918.78s -> 12919.82s]  I think I sold everything.
[12920.70s -> 12923.98s]  Someone in here sells blueprints for weapons.
[12923.98s -> 12925.26s]  Or it was that other place we were at.
[12925.26s -> 12927.10s]  They were selling a lot of weapon blueprints.
[12927.10s -> 12929.98s]  Well, yeah, this guy has like weapon mods for the shaft.
[12929.98s -> 12931.58s]  You want like a different shaft weapon.
[12934.01s -> 12936.89s]  Oh, he's got some flame tips.
[12936.89s -> 12937.29s]  Oxy.
[12938.41s -> 12938.81s]  Fire.
[12940.57s -> 12943.21s]  I think I want the toxic and the fire.
[12943.21s -> 12943.85s]  I want them both.
[12944.97s -> 12945.21s]  Yeah.
[12945.93s -> 12949.18s]  Yeah, definitely.
[12949.18s -> 12949.50s]  Nice.
[12950.54s -> 12951.10s]  Okay.
[12951.10s -> 12952.78s]  Now we go to the weapon.
[12952.78s -> 12953.90s]  Wait, that's not the weapon I want.
[12954.86s -> 12956.73s]  I want to put it on this.
[12958.49s -> 12963.16s]  Let's go ahead and put my blueprints.
[12963.80s -> 12965.56s]  I just bought them.
[12965.56s -> 12965.96s]  Where are they?
[12966.52s -> 12970.94s]  Didn't I buy them?
[12970.94s -> 12973.77s]  Those tips might have been for arrows.
[12974.33s -> 12977.53s]  And I just buy blueprints.
[12977.53s -> 12978.01s]  Where do they go?
[12980.06s -> 12982.54s]  When you go to modify your weapon, that's where they show up.
[12983.56s -> 12984.84s]  That was a shaft mod.
[12985.72s -> 12985.96s]  Yeah.
[12987.54s -> 12989.06s]  I was toxic to one.
[12989.06s -> 12989.38s]  Okay.
[12990.18s -> 12993.19s]  Do you know a tip mod?
[12993.19s -> 12993.59s]  How do I?
[12995.03s -> 12998.63s]  You press C on the weapon and then I bought one as a tip.
[12998.63s -> 13000.47s]  And then there's a shaft and there's a charm.
[13000.47s -> 13001.59s]  If you want to put a charm on it.
[13001.59s -> 13005.59s]  Oh, I get you.
[13006.39s -> 13009.35s]  So I can put like a flaming tip at the top of my shaft.
[13009.35s -> 13009.67s]  Okay.
[13010.39s -> 13011.27s]  My venom shaft.
[13012.31s -> 13015.11s]  I have a fire on the shaft.
[13015.11s -> 13016.09s]  Okay.
[13016.09s -> 13016.33s]  Yeah.
[13016.33s -> 13019.13s]  I've got a flaming weapon and a shaft.
[13019.13s -> 13020.65s]  Oh, this is cool.
[13020.65s -> 13020.97s]  Yeah.
[13020.97s -> 13021.21s]  Okay.
[13021.85s -> 13022.25s]  You ready?
[13022.89s -> 13023.13s]  Yeah.
[13036.31s -> 13036.87s]  I'm healing.
[13039.67s -> 13039.91s]  Okay.
[13041.80s -> 13043.72s]  So what story mission are we on now?
[13044.68s -> 13045.96s]  Get some work at the bazaar.
[13047.40s -> 13048.68s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[13048.68s -> 13051.24s]  Let me see if I have other quests.
[13051.88s -> 13055.16s]  See, I thought that was part of the main one.
[13055.16s -> 13056.04s]  Get some work.
[13057.00s -> 13059.38s]  I thought we just did work though.
[13059.38s -> 13060.82s]  Do we have to keep you inside missions?
[13061.62s -> 13063.22s]  We might have to do another.
[13064.31s -> 13065.03s]  Get some work.
[13065.59s -> 13068.87s]  Is there anybody else that has a job in here?
[13071.29s -> 13071.61s]  Yeah.
[13071.61s -> 13072.33s]  Story quest.
[13073.21s -> 13074.57s]  The only way out.
[13074.57s -> 13076.09s]  That's what we're doing, right?
[13076.09s -> 13077.21s]  I think so.
[13077.21s -> 13078.41s]  I mean, there's a person over here.
[13081.50s -> 13083.66s]  All players required to talk to this lady.
[13083.66s -> 13083.90s]  Yep.
[13083.90s -> 13085.42s]  We got to keep doing these.
[13085.98s -> 13093.66s]  Coming gas can, I'm sorry.
[13094.22s -> 13095.18s]  I just might be nothing.
[13095.18s -> 13095.50s]  I don't know.
[13107.08s -> 13107.56s]  Did we do it?
[13108.28s -> 13109.08s]  Yeah, I think we did it.
[13111.50s -> 13111.74s]  What?
[13111.74s -> 13112.30s]  We didn't do it.
[13115.56s -> 13115.96s]  What is it?
[13117.08s -> 13120.06s]  Hey, does anyone need any work?
[13120.94s -> 13121.98s]  Does anybody have anything to do?
[13123.10s -> 13124.22s]  Anyone have any work for us?
[13126.31s -> 13127.59s]  Anyone here you need?
[13127.59s -> 13128.39s]  Hey, all players.
[13128.39s -> 13129.83s]  Hey, this guy needs some work.
[13130.87s -> 13134.74s]  Please wait.
[13135.70s -> 13136.26s]  I'm waiting.
[13140.07s -> 13140.79s]  Yeah, I'm waiting.
[13141.59s -> 13142.07s]  Yep.
[13142.07s -> 13142.31s]  Okay.
[13142.31s -> 13142.95s]  We need some more.
[13142.95s -> 13143.99s]  Anyone here got some work?
[13144.79s -> 13145.35s]  He's wait.
[13145.91s -> 13147.35s]  All players required for this person.
[13148.39s -> 13151.91s]  Can I help you?
[13152.47s -> 13154.23s]  Can you help me to give me help to you?
[13154.23s -> 13155.83s]  Oh, perfect.
[13156.63s -> 13157.59s]  Thank you for the gift.
[13157.59s -> 13158.15s]  What do we get?
[13159.11s -> 13160.15s]  Who's Benny?
[13160.15s -> 13161.51s]  Who really is judging?
[13161.51s -> 13162.23s]  I'm confused.
[13162.95s -> 13163.83s]  This doesn't make any sense.
[13163.83s -> 13164.39s]  What are they saying?
[13165.03s -> 13167.67s]  Hey, get some work done.
[13168.87s -> 13169.75s]  Hey, this guy.
[13171.21s -> 13172.01s]  Please wait.
[13172.01s -> 13172.97s]  It still says please wait.
[13175.58s -> 13178.06s]  Look on your side quest for ones that say bizarre.
[13178.94s -> 13180.62s]  Yeah, we might already have.
[13180.62s -> 13182.06s]  Yeah, I probably already accept.
[13182.06s -> 13182.78s]  Did you already take one?
[13183.58s -> 13186.14s]  I took a bunch before stream started.
[13188.10s -> 13188.74s]  Side quest.
[13188.74s -> 13189.46s]  Cheers.
[13189.46s -> 13191.46s]  Yeah, they're saying these are side quests.
[13191.46s -> 13193.14s]  Return to Carlos.
[13193.14s -> 13194.90s]  Current objective report to the board.
[13196.34s -> 13197.22s]  Oh, I have to track.
[13197.22s -> 13199.46s]  I think that just kind of all they're all here.
[13199.46s -> 13200.26s]  They're all in front of us.
[13203.10s -> 13204.62s]  Skips all dialogue.
[13204.62s -> 13205.90s]  I'm confused, bro.
[13207.42s -> 13208.22s]  Yeah, that's the joke.
[13208.22s -> 13208.86s]  You got it.
[13208.86s -> 13209.50s]  I know.
[13210.94s -> 13212.30s]  Yeah, he got the joke.
[13212.30s -> 13213.26s]  We can't talk to this guy.
[13214.30s -> 13215.26s]  He's too popular.
[13216.22s -> 13218.62s]  We need to turn the quest into him and we can't.
[13219.94s -> 13220.74s]  I'm confused.
[13220.74s -> 13221.30s]  Is that okay?
[13221.86s -> 13223.16s]  Are we sure he's not above us?
[13223.88s -> 13224.84s]  No, it's over his head.
[13225.48s -> 13229.05s]  Okay.
[13229.05s -> 13229.85s]  Well, is there another one?
[13230.33s -> 13233.16s]  I mean, we did that quest.
[13233.16s -> 13234.76s]  I feel like I deserve credit for it.
[13235.48s -> 13239.16s]  Who else has a turn in?
[13239.80s -> 13240.60s]  Oh, Bebin.
[13241.16s -> 13243.19s]  Okay, let me look at what else we can do.
[13243.19s -> 13243.83s]  A different one.
[13247.50s -> 13248.70s]  Bring Lavender.
[13248.70s -> 13249.66s]  Oh, we can apparently.
[13252.14s -> 13253.66s]  Everything else is further away.
[13255.61s -> 13256.09s]  That guy.
[13257.05s -> 13261.56s]  I don't think we can talk to this guy.
[13262.36s -> 13264.12s]  Okay, let's go do this.
[13264.12s -> 13266.76s]  Then we can come back later when he decides to work.
[13266.76s -> 13268.44s]  Wait, are you still pointing me to what?
[13271.11s -> 13271.91s]  It's doing this.
[13272.79s -> 13273.99s]  I know there's someone out back.
[13274.55s -> 13278.23s]  Go to the main menu and then go back in.
[13278.95s -> 13279.99s]  No, don't do it.
[13279.99s -> 13280.23s]  Okay.
[13280.23s -> 13281.27s]  It's honestly a scam.
[13282.23s -> 13283.40s]  Oh, this is right here.
[13286.33s -> 13289.98s]  No, let's run 100 meters.
[13290.62s -> 13292.84s]  We're runners.
[13292.84s -> 13293.48s]  That's our job.
[13294.12s -> 13303.00s]  It's nighttime.
[13303.00s -> 13303.56s]  It's scary.
[13304.28s -> 13305.72s]  I'm honestly not afraid of the dark.
[13307.72s -> 13308.84s]  That's Aiden.
[13308.84s -> 13311.32s]  I've just been offered an extremely shady deal,
[13311.32s -> 13313.72s]  but maybe it'll turn up a lead on Lucas.
[13315.08s -> 13316.76s]  There's two random quests here.
[13316.76s -> 13318.28s]  Whatever it is, check it out.
[13318.28s -> 13319.32s]  Main quest.
[13319.32s -> 13320.44s]  That's right.
[13320.44s -> 13321.24s]  Yep.
[13321.24s -> 13321.64s]  Thank you.
[13321.64s -> 13322.76s]  Thanks for correcting me there.
[13326.81s -> 13327.61s]  All players.
[13327.61s -> 13328.09s]  Let's go.
[13332.97s -> 13333.61s]  Wait, I'm confused.
[13336.57s -> 13337.45s]  What did I agree to?
[13338.09s -> 13339.61s]  I don't know what just happened.
[13340.33s -> 13343.16s]  Didn't you hear what I said?
[13343.16s -> 13344.28s]  Get downstairs.
[13346.49s -> 13347.69s]  Oh, didn't you hear what I said?
[13347.69s -> 13348.33s]  Get downstairs.
[13349.05s -> 13354.47s]  See, they know.
[13354.47s -> 13355.67s]  I don't dig through the trash.
[13355.67s -> 13356.39s]  Does that hurt me?
[13358.15s -> 13359.27s]  This isn't a main quest,
[13359.27s -> 13361.51s]  but we can't do the main quest until we do all the side quests here.
[13362.63s -> 13366.01s]  I'm here for the job.
[13366.01s -> 13369.66s]  So you're new around here.
[13369.66s -> 13370.14s]  Damien.
[13372.22s -> 13373.26s]  Fly and say I'm a local.
[13374.06s -> 13375.10s]  Yeah, I'm a local.
[13375.10s -> 13377.06s]  Born and bred, if you must know.
[13377.70s -> 13380.50s]  Then why haven't I ever seen you before?
[13380.50s -> 13381.54s]  Couldn't say.
[13381.54s -> 13383.46s]  We're tightly packed, but it's still a big city.
[13384.02s -> 13384.90s]  I heard there's a new game.
[13384.90s -> 13386.50s]  This game makes no fucking sense.
[13386.50s -> 13387.06s]  It does.
[13387.06s -> 13389.22s]  We're just skipping every dialogue piece.
[13391.18s -> 13392.38s]  Double down.
[13392.38s -> 13395.53s]  Pilgrims are nomads.
[13395.53s -> 13396.89s]  The story is probably interesting.
[13396.89s -> 13397.13s]  I don't know.
[13397.13s -> 13397.53s]  It could be.
[13397.53s -> 13398.25s]  I have one.
[13398.25s -> 13401.14s]  That's another thing.
[13401.14s -> 13404.09s]  Almost got lynched at the bazaar.
[13404.73s -> 13406.06s]  Didn't have a marker.
[13406.06s -> 13406.94s]  When is this guy gay?
[13406.94s -> 13408.94s]  Some say he was recently infected.
[13409.74s -> 13411.45s]  Ring a bell.
[13411.45s -> 13412.33s]  What are they talking about us?
[13413.13s -> 13413.85s]  I double down.
[13414.49s -> 13415.69s]  I saw that guy.
[13415.69s -> 13417.53s]  He was taken outside by a hack on.
[13418.17s -> 13418.73s]  And killed.
[13419.69s -> 13420.49s]  Maybe he was.
[13421.77s -> 13423.61s]  Or maybe he will be.
[13423.61s -> 13426.01s]  Because he's sitting here lying to my face.
[13426.01s -> 13428.81s]  You know what they need to put into games for idiots like us?
[13429.45s -> 13430.90s]  What?
[13430.90s -> 13432.98s]  Like an audio tape you can play.
[13432.98s -> 13435.30s]  That's five minutes long that plays while you're playing.
[13435.30s -> 13436.42s]  That tells you the whole story.
[13438.17s -> 13439.05s]  We wouldn't look into it.
[13439.69s -> 13440.33s]  You don't think so?
[13441.85s -> 13442.17s]  No.
[13442.89s -> 13443.21s]  Okay.
[13444.92s -> 13446.04s]  And a lot of games do that.
[13446.04s -> 13449.56s]  Like when you're the master chief and you have the little blue girl telling you.
[13451.48s -> 13455.00s]  You think we would skip that if it was like oh hey for the people.
[13455.64s -> 13456.36s]  We're fighting these guys.
[13456.36s -> 13457.24s]  Yeah we're fighting them.
[13457.24s -> 13458.52s]  Did it matter?
[13461.24s -> 13462.84s]  Oh my god I threw a spear in that guy's head.
[13462.84s -> 13467.02s]  Wait why?
[13467.02s -> 13467.98s]  The guy lit on fire?
[13468.86s -> 13470.15s]  Yeah you got a fire weapon.
[13470.15s -> 13470.79s]  Oh that's right.
[13470.79s -> 13471.59s]  This is awesome.
[13472.55s -> 13474.28s]  Oh they got more goons.
[13475.00s -> 13476.04s]  Like that was the main guy.
[13476.04s -> 13476.68s]  He's already dead.
[13481.50s -> 13483.34s]  Wow I feel like our weapons are dealing damage.
[13487.51s -> 13489.83s]  Let me get that guy.
[13489.83s -> 13490.71s]  A roadie vest.
[13490.71s -> 13491.35s]  Okay let's go.
[13491.91s -> 13494.58s]  I'm a bit of a roadie.
[13498.10s -> 13501.77s]  This thing is awesome.
[13502.41s -> 13507.69s]  This is Fallout for people that don't want to play Fallout.
[13511.78s -> 13513.46s]  I mean it's not a mid-dime.
[13513.46s -> 13515.30s]  It's our business strategy.
[13515.30s -> 13517.62s]  We heard there's a lot of people out there that don't want to play Fallout.
[13517.62s -> 13519.22s]  So we're gonna make Fallout.
[13523.00s -> 13524.04s]  Okay board meeting approved.
[13524.04s -> 13524.68s]  Here's your budget.
[13534.94s -> 13535.50s]  I can't.
[13537.59s -> 13538.55s]  Oh I wonder who this person is.
[13543.24s -> 13544.36s]  I should tell Carl this.
[13547.67s -> 13551.83s]  You don't think it's like the little Microsoft paperclip guy was in the corner like.
[13551.83s -> 13555.91s]  So this is this is Damian and he's one of those players that you come across.
[13555.91s -> 13557.51s]  He's Michael's son.
[13558.07s -> 13559.19s]  Just for us to know.
[13559.19s -> 13560.68s]  Hey I got like choices.
[13560.68s -> 13562.38s]  Do I want to help him?
[13562.38s -> 13563.42s]  That sounds like a side quest.
[13564.47s -> 13566.15s]  Be careful he's a swindler.
[13566.15s -> 13568.15s]  Like and then and then the paperclip disappears.
[13569.27s -> 13575.69s]  Why do you keep doing that to me?
[13575.69s -> 13577.85s]  Because you were very hurt and I worry.
[13577.85s -> 13579.61s]  That wouldn't be immersive.
[13579.61s -> 13581.29s]  No but it's something you could turn off and on.
[13582.01s -> 13585.90s]  Oh so we're arguing against accessibility now.
[13585.90s -> 13587.50s]  No I said you can turn it off and on.
[13587.50s -> 13588.22s]  It's off and on.
[13588.22s -> 13591.34s]  I'm saying I'm saying the chatter like oh you don't want to go there.
[13591.82s -> 13594.55s]  Remember was the one guy that liked Clippy.
[13596.54s -> 13597.66s]  Oh look down there.
[13599.38s -> 13601.56s]  Oh is that Zeds?
[13601.56s -> 13605.56s]  You want to do something about this?
[13605.56s -> 13606.20s]  You want to defeat?
[13606.20s -> 13607.24s]  It does say defeat.
[13607.24s -> 13608.36s]  It does say defeat.
[13608.36s -> 13611.16s]  It does like that's a little Clippy telling us defeat.
[13611.16s -> 13613.42s]  We have any bombs or anything?
[13613.42s -> 13614.78s]  I don't have any bombs or anything.
[13614.78s -> 13616.06s]  All right well let's just go.
[13616.06s -> 13617.74s]  We got cool elemental weapons.
[13618.30s -> 13619.10s]  Hey you want to drop?
[13619.10s -> 13620.14s]  Oh there's a spear up here.
[13620.94s -> 13621.82s]  Nice good start.
[13622.46s -> 13626.65s]  We can double spear.
[13629.27s -> 13631.67s]  One two three.
[13632.95s -> 13633.90s]  We both miss.
[13634.70s -> 13635.82s]  No I threw it already.
[13636.06s -> 13636.54s]  I hit him.
[13639.91s -> 13647.91s]  Um okay careful.
[13647.91s -> 13650.22s]  He's on fire.
[13657.83s -> 13658.15s]  Nice.
[13658.87s -> 13667.64s]  You dare don't you dare.
[13669.40s -> 13669.80s]  He's dead.
[13674.52s -> 13675.00s]  Trophy.
[13675.00s -> 13675.96s]  Oh that was cool nice.
[13679.83s -> 13680.39s]  Perfume.
[13684.23s -> 13685.99s]  It's very weird how that just happened but I'll take it.
[13690.86s -> 13693.74s]  Yeah I finally unlocked power attack.
[13694.54s -> 13696.22s]  Seems kind of uh.
[13696.22s -> 13697.50s]  You got power attack?
[13697.50s -> 13698.86s]  I got power attack yeah.
[13699.58s -> 13704.89s]  Okay so let's keep moving.
[13704.89s -> 13710.02s]  Is someone ringing a bell?
[13712.06s -> 13713.50s]  The toll of the undead.
[13715.94s -> 13717.62s]  That is in every game isn't it?
[13718.50s -> 13720.82s]  Oh the toll of the dead.
[13724.10s -> 13726.97s]  You're saying bells are overdone.
[13726.97s -> 13728.25s]  I think they're in everything.
[13728.25s -> 13733.21s]  I think like the church bells symbolizes the undead has been.
[13733.21s -> 13736.68s]  Yeah what happened?
[13736.68s -> 13739.13s]  What happened?
[13739.69s -> 13740.58s]  I got kicked out.
[13741.64s -> 13745.32s]  Oh you said you left my session and then I dropped my weapon.
[13745.32s -> 13746.74s]  Did you get kicked out?
[13747.30s -> 13748.82s]  No I'm still in here.
[13748.82s -> 13752.33s]  What can you re-invite me?
[13753.59s -> 13755.70s]  Um help.
[13755.70s -> 13757.40s]  Try and re-invite.
[13757.40s -> 13761.56s]  Are you online?
[13761.56s -> 13762.44s]  I should be.
[13764.39s -> 13765.54s]  What's that all about?
[13769.50s -> 13771.02s]  Robo Yerma?
[13771.02s -> 13772.30s]  He sounds normal to me.
[13772.30s -> 13773.26s]  Wait did my stream die?
[13774.14s -> 13780.28s]  Whatever.
[13780.28s -> 13785.16s]  It was me oh shit.
[13785.16s -> 13786.68s]  I guess my internet effed for a second.
[13789.24s -> 13790.44s]  Do I sound weird?
[13790.44s -> 13791.00s]  A little bit yeah.
[13792.22s -> 13793.02s]  Well are you back?
[13793.02s -> 13793.58s]  Yeah you're back.
[13793.58s -> 13794.14s]  I think I'm back.
[13794.14s -> 13796.14s]  I think it was just a little a little chunky eff it's okay.
[13797.10s -> 13802.30s]  A little bit of uh yeah.
[13802.30s -> 13804.38s]  Uh can you pull me to where you are?
[13804.38s -> 13813.02s]  I can't act well I mean maybe if I go to this NPC I can.
[13813.02s -> 13816.86s]  Yeah that one counted because now Sophie wants to talk to us because we did the side quest.
[13816.86s -> 13817.50s]  Oh good.
[13818.70s -> 13820.46s]  We just had to do one side quest.
[13822.22s -> 13823.82s]  We've been running around for hours.
[13825.66s -> 13827.70s]  Hey she has a good one on her trust.
[13828.86s -> 13829.82s]  Okay fast travel.
[13830.54s -> 13833.30s]  Teleporting to leader in nine seconds.
[13833.30s -> 13834.18s]  Why can't I just do it now?
[13834.74s -> 13836.26s]  Yeah can you please call me leader?
[13837.93s -> 13839.13s]  Am I still dropping frames?
[13839.13s -> 13847.53s]  Do you want to see me?
[13847.53s -> 13849.05s]  I've been hearing about you.
[13849.61s -> 13851.21s]  Good or bad things?
[13851.21s -> 13853.29s]  How many people are streaming the super bowl?
[13853.29s -> 13855.94s]  The ones that make me believe it's worth giving you a chance.
[13855.94s -> 13858.10s]  Yeah don't you know what you're posing?
[13858.10s -> 13858.58s]  Go to one of the-
[13858.58s -> 13859.38s]  I do have fiber yeah.
[13863.64s -> 13865.64s]  Waiting for other players before proceeding okay.
[13868.65s -> 13869.29s]  Now I am.
[13869.29s -> 13870.57s]  It's probably just a little bump.
[13870.57s -> 13872.39s]  It happens sometimes.
[13875.32s -> 13876.68s]  I do have gigabit connection.
[13876.68s -> 13877.16s]  I have fiber.
[13878.73s -> 13879.53s]  It's very rare.
[13879.53s -> 13885.62s]  It's very rare that this happens.
[13885.62s -> 13887.06s]  Oh it'll pass it'll be good.
[13933.48s -> 13934.68s]  Well let's see if I come back.
[13938.30s -> 13941.35s]  Weird I'm back.
[13941.35s -> 13943.43s]  Yeah I just guys I just did a speed test.
[13943.43s -> 13945.35s]  I'm at a thousand a thousand.
[13945.35s -> 13946.71s]  I'm at full connection.
[13947.35s -> 13948.71s]  It looks like something weird's going on.
[13949.35s -> 13950.95s]  But um we'll try this again.
[13951.77s -> 13954.33s]  I mean maybe the super bowl is shutting down every-
[13954.33s -> 13957.14s]  Like maybe the super bowl is so crazy that like
[13957.14s -> 13959.22s]  nothing else is going to work for years.
[13959.22s -> 13960.49s]  Maybe it's the twitch server.
[13960.49s -> 13961.29s]  I don't think it's a twitch server
[13961.29s -> 13963.37s]  because I wouldn't be dropping from the game too.
[13963.37s -> 13970.94s]  Thanks for the invite.
[13970.94s -> 13972.06s]  Hey no problem.
[13972.06s -> 13977.80s]  Yeah I wouldn't be dropping out of the game.
[13980.50s -> 13982.42s]  Weirdly I'm not dropping out of the call.
[13982.42s -> 13985.82s]  That's kind of weird.
[13986.46s -> 13988.62s]  Well you're not even like-
[13988.62s -> 13990.14s]  Actually I think you did drop out of the call
[13990.14s -> 13991.82s]  for a little bit when you disconnected.
[13994.81s -> 13998.70s]  I couldn't hear you for a moment.
[13998.70s -> 13999.74s]  It's probably still happening.
[14006.30s -> 14007.51s]  Am I still here?
[14008.50s -> 14009.30s]  Yeah.
[14009.30s -> 14010.74s]  Okay well let's just try it.
[14010.74s -> 14011.78s]  Let's just let's just go.
[14014.17s -> 14018.57s]  Oh fiber omega low burr omega low whatever.
[14019.13s -> 14020.41s]  Yeah how much do you pay a month?
[14020.41s -> 14022.65s]  Like seven thousand dollars for this internet?
[14022.65s -> 14026.01s]  Actually actually way less than I was paying before
[14026.01s -> 14027.21s]  for like cable internet.
[14028.57s -> 14036.12s]  Yeah I bet.
[14036.12s -> 14037.32s]  Banana bro here.
[14037.32s -> 14038.68s]  Ditch that loser stream.
[14038.68s -> 14040.12s]  What does stir call you guys here?
[14040.12s -> 14041.08s]  The pineapple people?
[14041.72s -> 14044.28s]  No come back to my stream.
[14044.28s -> 14045.24s]  Come back to my stream.
[14045.24s -> 14046.44s]  Don't don't go straight away.
[14046.44s -> 14048.60s]  Hey welcome to the stir mada.
[14048.60s -> 14052.22s]  It's like an armada but like you know
[14052.22s -> 14055.50s]  let's hit 100,000 likes and show how strong we are.
[14055.50s -> 14057.98s]  The star mada is coming into the solar system.
[14057.98s -> 14059.03s]  That's actually pretty cool.
[14059.03s -> 14059.83s]  I would probably sub.
[14062.89s -> 14063.85s]  All right get over here.
[14063.85s -> 14065.53s]  Said no one ever.
[14065.53s -> 14070.57s]  Wait where are you?
[14070.57s -> 14072.65s]  I'm at the quest.
[14072.65s -> 14074.95s]  Oh I was facing out.
[14074.95s -> 14076.22s]  I was reading.
[14076.22s -> 14079.88s]  The stir mada.
[14079.88s -> 14084.70s]  What are the uh germa's group of inhumane psychopaths?
[14084.70s -> 14086.14s]  No the germamites.
[14086.14s -> 14089.72s]  You gotta get it right.
[14089.72s -> 14090.68s]  The germamites.
[14099.22s -> 14099.86s]  Have I told you?
[14100.42s -> 14102.62s]  Wait never mind.
[14102.62s -> 14104.39s]  How did Barney get hurt?
[14104.39s -> 14105.83s]  What happened at the Super Bowl halftime show?
[14105.83s -> 14109.38s]  Did he like break his leg like sprain his ankle?
[14109.38s -> 14117.91s]  Oh no not another Barney nip flip.
[14117.91s -> 14119.03s]  Wait wait after.
[14119.03s -> 14121.56s]  While exploring the city you'll come across characters
[14121.56s -> 14123.56s]  marked with the midnight carpet.
[14123.56s -> 14126.95s]  Okay.
[14126.95s -> 14131.26s]  And then you hold t to fast forward to night.
[14131.26s -> 14134.14s]  So I think it's that thing that gas station we're at.

[14157.83s -> 14159.75s]  not that long ago like I was panicked.
[14160.39s -> 14162.71s]  Um you probably like have your own story
[14162.71s -> 14165.51s]  like where you were on that day when Facebook was down.
[14168.76s -> 14170.12s]  No I don't.
[14170.12s -> 14180.02s]  Crap didn't Facebook just say that like
[14180.02s -> 14183.51s]  they're gonna pull all operations out of Europe
[14183.51s -> 14187.40s]  like if they don't like if they can't do advertising or something.
[14187.40s -> 14190.49s]  Can you imagine if Facebook just was like
[14190.49s -> 14193.42s]  yeah we're not in Europe anymore.
[14193.42s -> 14194.62s]  That was a bluff.
[14194.62s -> 14195.90s]  I don't know I'm just saying I've read that.
[14198.47s -> 14200.47s]  I mean someone would immediately take their place.
[14206.31s -> 14208.79s]  Yeah I don't I don't know about all that.
[14213.94s -> 14216.66s]  I feel like opinions are you like kind of cringe.
[14216.66s -> 14219.14s]  Somebody's talking like robbing somebody.
[14220.34s -> 14221.94s]  Yeah I'm interested in the main quest.
[14223.18s -> 14224.70s]  They bluff they got called out.

[14254.07s -> 14255.53s]  I did actually.
[14255.53s -> 14256.01s]  Pretty cool.
[14256.57s -> 14257.85s]  Do you know DMCA isn't real?
[14257.85s -> 14258.89s]  I know you already went over this.
[14258.89s -> 14261.05s]  You already talked about a bunch of shit about this.
[14261.05s -> 14262.57s]  Okay I just want to make sure you're in the know
[14262.57s -> 14264.49s]  because if you're not then you look like a fool.
[14264.49s -> 14265.21s]  What happened?
[14265.21s -> 14266.09s]  What happened to this guy?
[14268.34s -> 14269.30s]  Can we actually find out?
[14269.94s -> 14271.30s]  Wait do you want to help him?
[14271.30s -> 14272.10s]  We're kind of tripping.
[14273.19s -> 14274.47s]  Yes let's help him.
[14274.47s -> 14275.35s]  I'll do what I can.
[14275.99s -> 14276.87s]  Let's don't skip this.
[14276.87s -> 14278.23s]  All right I'll do what I can.
[14285.06s -> 14286.02s]  Okay he's gone.
[14286.10s -> 14286.74s]  Was he a ghost?
[14286.74s -> 14287.46s]  Was he not real?
[14288.76s -> 14289.40s]  Hey where is he?
[14294.84s -> 14298.22s]  We have two things to do.
[14298.22s -> 14299.98s]  Should we go over there?
[14300.70s -> 14302.22s]  Climb the windmill and restore power.
[14302.86s -> 14305.67s]  Or search for Barney.
[14306.23s -> 14307.72s]  Let's turn the power on.
[14307.72s -> 14309.16s]  That was like the choice quest we had.
[14311.56s -> 14312.20s]  Uh okay.
[14312.84s -> 14313.56s]  It's a container.
[14314.20s -> 14315.32s]  Uh okay.
[14316.74s -> 14318.58s]  I know main story main story main story
[14318.58s -> 14320.18s]  but it's fun to walk around and get stuff.
[14322.50s -> 14323.32s]  Am I lagging?
[14323.32s -> 14324.28s]  Is that you making a joke?
[14324.28s -> 14326.28s]  Yeah I'm making fun of you.
[14326.28s -> 14327.88s]  You're kind of robotting again.
[14327.88s -> 14328.20s]  What?
[14332.87s -> 14333.83s]  Wait what?
[14333.83s -> 14336.36s]  It's in here somewhere.
[14336.36s -> 14342.55s]  Is it on the roof?
[14345.19s -> 14346.55s]  There's one there's a one and a two.
[14346.55s -> 14347.27s]  I'm at the one.
[14347.91s -> 14352.07s]  It wants me to climb up top.
[14352.63s -> 14359.27s]  And I didn't get I didn't get the one cycle.
[14361.03s -> 14362.47s]  And every moment that you're not talking
[14362.47s -> 14363.51s]  I feel like you disconnected.
[14363.51s -> 14364.55s]  I'm still I'm here I'm here.
[14365.19s -> 14367.27s]  Okay like I'm worried about you.
[14367.27s -> 14368.31s]  Uh I found the thing.
[14369.43s -> 14371.03s]  I found the uh the thing.
[14371.83s -> 14372.79s]  I'm doing a different thing.
[14373.75s -> 14375.54s]  And I'm already like part way through it.
[14375.54s -> 14377.62s]  I feel like my thing's in precedence.
[14377.62s -> 14380.42s]  I mean can I loot this and do you get the credit for it?
[14381.30s -> 14381.94s]  I don't know.
[14381.94s -> 14382.60s]  Find out.
[14384.39s -> 14386.55s]  Oh dude you're gonna want to come over here.
[14386.55s -> 14387.43s]  This is a neck guitar.
[14388.54s -> 14389.74s]  Okay I'm coming.
[14389.74s -> 14391.43s]  There actually is one of those.
[14391.43s -> 14392.15s]  There's an inhibitor.
[14397.30s -> 14398.74s]  Okay teleporting to you.
[14407.19s -> 14407.91s]  VR hands.
[14409.67s -> 14410.79s]  It does kind of look like that.
[14411.75s -> 14415.96s]  Oh we did it we built a whole settlement.
[14416.76s -> 14417.93s]  Everyone's moving in.
[14418.57s -> 14420.41s]  Don't do that right next to your thigh.
[14420.49s -> 14421.85s]  Oh my god that was dangerous.
[14423.56s -> 14424.60s]  They don't know any better.
[14424.60s -> 14428.73s]  Oh you did it.
[14433.45s -> 14435.45s]  Somebody said iPad ad commercial.
[14437.32s -> 14438.36s]  It does feel like that.
[14439.00s -> 14445.18s]  Activate the windmill creates a safe zone around it.
[14445.18s -> 14446.50s]  Wow.
[14446.50s -> 14451.86s]  Okay cool.
[14451.86s -> 14456.71s]  There's a glider and a grappling hook in this game.
[14456.71s -> 14458.39s]  And at this pace you're never gonna see it.
[14461.10s -> 14462.14s]  Look at how pretty that is.
[14462.78s -> 14464.31s]  So the bitrate can catch up.
[14464.31s -> 14465.99s]  Just I'm not gonna move but damn.
[14473.11s -> 14474.63s]  Yeah I'm gonna use my glider right now.
[14477.13s -> 14478.97s]  But we're doing it on our own pace.
[14478.97s -> 14480.33s]  We don't have to be super gamers about it.
[14480.33s -> 14481.93s]  We're just enjoying the time.
[14485.59s -> 14487.99s]  Yeah speedrun already finished this game by now.
[14487.99s -> 14490.60s]  Just give up.
[14495.98s -> 14496.94s]  Yeah I'm giving.
[14496.94s -> 14498.46s]  Oh my god there's so many Zams.
[14499.10s -> 14501.02s]  What happened to the guy that was like help me.
[14501.02s -> 14502.78s]  And we're all on drugs while we shook his hand.
[14504.70s -> 14505.50s]  He wasn't real.
[14506.06s -> 14506.62s]  Oh my god.
[14508.22s -> 14509.77s]  What do you mean you're run.
[14510.33s -> 14510.81s]  I'm running.
[14511.90s -> 14512.54s]  Oh you're in.
[14512.54s -> 14513.26s]  I thought you were okay.
[14513.98s -> 14518.82s]  I'm in the corner.
[14518.82s -> 14524.73s]  I'm about to go down.
[14525.53s -> 14534.47s]  I have no stamina.
[14535.03s -> 14540.50s]  I'll heal you.
[14540.50s -> 14540.98s]  I'll do it to you.
[14541.86s -> 14545.27s]  Got you.
[14545.27s -> 14548.04s]  I'm electrified.
[14551.82s -> 14554.47s]  Oh wait I have one of these.
[14555.27s -> 14556.22s]  Do it.
[14557.02s -> 14557.26s]  Whoa.
[14558.65s -> 14558.97s]  Whoa.
[14566.44s -> 14566.76s]  Nice.
[14567.88s -> 14568.84s]  We got a lot of looting to do.
[14569.40s -> 14570.12s]  Players required.
[14579.94s -> 14580.50s]  Lot of loot.
[14581.54s -> 14582.26s]  Investigation.
[14583.42s -> 14585.42s]  Yeah I feel like we've done that a hundred times.
[14586.30s -> 14586.70s]  I know.
[14587.74s -> 14589.91s]  I feel like there was a whole tutorial.
[14589.91s -> 14590.95s]  I think we did that already.
[14591.59s -> 14595.74s]  Oh shit.
[14595.74s -> 14597.02s]  Wait how do we do this investigation.
[14597.02s -> 14597.90s]  There's like footprints here.
[14598.46s -> 14599.98s]  We just have to follow the footprints.
[14600.78s -> 14601.34s]  What.
[14601.34s -> 14601.98s]  Where are they going.
[14602.62s -> 14603.34s]  We'll find out.
[14606.23s -> 14606.63s]  Sophie.
[14607.43s -> 14608.68s]  It's fresh.
[14608.68s -> 14609.32s]  What am I doing.
[14610.44s -> 14611.67s]  Did you just eat that.
[14612.63s -> 14613.59s]  There's a crystal in here.
[14614.87s -> 14615.51s]  Power crystal.
[14616.31s -> 14616.63s]  Really.
[14617.27s -> 14617.83s]  Yeah.
[14619.03s -> 14621.03s]  You said you found an inhibitor in here earlier.
[14621.03s -> 14621.99s]  No I was backed up.
[14625.03s -> 14627.51s]  If you said that you'd give me a million dollars if I could show you where that was
[14627.51s -> 14628.23s]  I wouldn't be able to do it.
[14633.46s -> 14634.58s]  I have no idea where that was.
[14634.58s -> 14637.06s]  It was like 40 meters right.
[14640.18s -> 14641.38s]  I'm just looting.
[14641.38s -> 14642.87s]  Okay the blood goes this way.
[14643.51s -> 14649.38s]  I think we're getting these crystals.
[14649.94s -> 14651.14s]  We're smashing open these crystals.
[14651.14s -> 14652.10s]  We're doing a little bit of mining.
[14652.10s -> 14653.94s]  They go up the stairs too by the way.
[14654.98s -> 14662.81s]  Oh yeah you can sell these can't you.
[14664.15s -> 14666.87s]  The guy I remember them in the tutorial he's like these go for a lot.
[14666.87s -> 14667.43s]  Just remember.
[14668.15s -> 14671.99s]  Yeah he was like these are the most expensive things you'll ever own in your life.
[14671.99s -> 14674.38s]  And then he he like took it.
[14675.10s -> 14676.17s]  He didn't share.
[14684.15s -> 14684.55s]  Power.
[14685.11s -> 14686.55s]  I got them.
[14694.09s -> 14694.97s]  Shrooms.
[14694.97s -> 14696.09s]  Not much stuff to pick up.
[14697.14s -> 14702.68s]  Yeah I uh there's a person door here where we need people.
[14702.68s -> 14704.20s]  Is there any more crystals up here that I didn't get.
[14705.24s -> 14707.35s]  No you lied to me.
[14707.91s -> 14710.94s]  Wait Barney's dead.
[14712.14s -> 14712.54s]  Who am I?
[14712.54s -> 14713.10s]  Who are you?
[14713.10s -> 14713.50s]  Sophie?
[14713.50s -> 14714.06s]  Who's that?
[14714.06s -> 14714.54s]  Who are you?
[14714.54s -> 14714.94s]  I'm me.
[14714.94s -> 14715.90s]  Where's crystals Barney?
[14715.90s -> 14716.38s]  Fuck off.
[14716.38s -> 14718.86s]  Wait okay Barney.
[14718.86s -> 14719.82s]  Barney fuck off.
[14720.62s -> 14722.06s]  Come out or I'll make you.
[14722.06s -> 14724.70s]  Come out or I'll drag you out myself.
[14724.70s -> 14727.74s]  Oh yeah I am he's Barney.
[14729.74s -> 14730.86s]  It really just did that.
[14731.82s -> 14733.96s]  Oh fuck fuck you Barney.
[14733.96s -> 14734.44s]  Fuck off.
[14737.30s -> 14746.71s]  Yeah why does this feel like tutorial number two?
[14747.43s -> 14749.35s]  Because it is we're wasting so much time.
[14752.22s -> 14754.54s]  We walked around for like an hour and a half.
[14755.42s -> 14757.18s]  Yeah but we got all that sick loot.
[14757.18s -> 14759.90s]  I know we look I'm not saying we had to go faster.
[14759.90s -> 14761.90s]  I'm just saying we haven't done much of the story missions.
[14762.46s -> 14764.31s]  These aren't level one enemies.
[14764.95s -> 14765.43s]  They are.
[14768.47s -> 14769.19s]  Is that Barney?
[14769.19s -> 14777.56s]  It is fun though.
[14778.20s -> 14785.08s]  Get out of here.
[14790.04s -> 14792.20s]  Are you going to stream Angry Birds Star Wars?
[14792.20s -> 14794.20s]  That's a that's a question for stir.
[14797.46s -> 14798.18s]  Why is that for me?
[14798.82s -> 14800.49s]  I don't know because I'm not.
[14801.88s -> 14808.95s]  Angry Birds Star Wars um you know I'll try anything once.
[14818.09s -> 14819.93s]  Everybody has the same black eye in this game.
[14819.93s -> 14820.57s]  Have you noticed that?
[14821.61s -> 14822.97s]  Yeah the same exact eye.
[14822.97s -> 14824.25s]  It's never the other one.
[14824.25s -> 14827.38s]  Are we going to look for him?
[14827.46s -> 14828.10s]  Sure.
[14828.10s -> 14837.99s]  Where can I find him?
[14837.99s -> 14839.43s]  Follow Birdie's trail.
[14840.31s -> 14843.03s]  Uh we got an inhibitor in range 40 meters.
[14843.03s -> 14843.59s]  Are we actually?
[14844.23s -> 14850.36s]  Yep we gotta go outside.
[14851.00s -> 14854.20s]  Wait what am I?
[14854.20s -> 14859.51s]  Birdie's I should lead me to him.
[14859.51s -> 14861.51s]  How do you know there's so much blood here?
[14864.41s -> 14865.69s]  There is a lot of blood.
[14866.33s -> 14867.61s]  That's my survivor sense.
[14868.49s -> 14869.69s]  Hey I gotta follow these footprints.
[14870.41s -> 14871.61s]  Everybody's covered in blood.
[14879.42s -> 14881.19s]  Oh come on.
[14882.36s -> 14882.68s]  What?
[14883.56s -> 14885.06s]  I lost connection again?
[14888.10s -> 14888.34s]  What?
[14889.14s -> 14890.95s]  What the hell?
[14890.95s -> 14891.59s]  What's happening?
[14892.23s -> 14894.92s]  I don't know.
[14894.92s -> 14895.64s]  Re-invite me.
[14896.44s -> 14899.22s]  I don't know does this make any sense?
[14899.86s -> 14903.37s]  They're trying to keep us apart.
[14903.37s -> 14908.82s]  Is my stream still live?
[14908.82s -> 14909.62s]  No that's fine.
[14910.58s -> 14911.14s]  I don't get it.
[14913.08s -> 14914.36s]  I think you're faking it.
[14914.36s -> 14917.69s]  Hey at this point I can't find a problem.
[14917.69s -> 14919.53s]  Oh like I have I guess I gotta go.
[14924.55s -> 14925.19s]  Um cast.
[14926.15s -> 14928.60s]  Oh this never happens.
[14928.68s -> 14929.96s]  This is a this is a new problem.
[14930.52s -> 14931.40s]  Invite you.
[14931.40s -> 14932.60s]  Did you?
[14934.26s -> 14935.30s]  Oh yeah I did.
[14935.30s -> 14938.26s]  Oh yeah I'm following Birdie's trail but I'm gonna wait for you.
[14938.26s -> 14939.24s]  I don't have an invite.
[14940.62s -> 14943.34s]  Okay I'm gonna I like everyone saw me do it.
[14943.34s -> 14947.90s]  Everyone over here on the Sturmata with the perfectly fine connection saw it happen.
[14947.90s -> 14954.34s]  Now this oh my god stop.
[14956.44s -> 14957.24s]  What the fuck?
[14958.52s -> 14959.00s]  What?
[14959.00s -> 14961.16s]  You just invited me to play like a hundred times.
[14963.34s -> 14963.66s]  Okay.
[14964.38s -> 14965.02s]  What's happening?
[14965.83s -> 14966.95s]  I wanted to make sure you got it.
[14971.00s -> 14971.80s]  Okay am I in your game?
[14972.70s -> 14972.94s]  Yeah.
[14972.94s -> 14973.34s]  Let's go.
[14974.30s -> 14975.26s]  Yeah I don't know what's going on.
[14975.26s -> 14975.82s]  That's weird.
[14975.82s -> 14978.06s]  You're like 200 meters away again but.
[14978.06s -> 14980.14s]  I can teleport to you in a second.
[14980.14s -> 14984.55s]  I don't know what this would be related to.
[14989.72s -> 14990.60s]  I don't know.
[14990.60s -> 15000.46s]  Can you pull me over there bud?
[15000.46s -> 15004.22s]  I can't until I'm like actually doing a quest thing that needs you.
[15004.22s -> 15010.66s]  I teleport to you from minimap and I teleport to you.
[15012.50s -> 15013.30s]  I can't.
[15015.02s -> 15016.70s]  If you just walk over here.
[15016.70s -> 15019.56s]  I mean it's 172 meters away that's far.
[15019.56s -> 15022.94s]  Plus I don't know how to get out of this house.
[15023.50s -> 15035.14s]  I mean I'm trying to find this inhibitor.
[15035.14s -> 15038.25s]  I actually don't know how to leave this house.
[15038.25s -> 15041.69s]  Okay I guess I'll go to the quest down here and then you'll teleport.
[15041.69s -> 15047.62s]  Every door it doesn't work if I get out of here.
[15047.62s -> 15051.42s]  Oh I'm following the footprints.
[15051.42s -> 15053.34s]  I actually forgot I need a tutorial.
[15056.70s -> 15057.02s]  Down?
[15066.97s -> 15068.89s]  I can't leave this area.
[15068.89s -> 15070.78s]  All the windows are boarded.
[15078.79s -> 15083.50s]  Open a door or something.
[15083.50s -> 15085.50s]  Every door is boarded up I can't leave.
[15086.14s -> 15087.62s]  Okay I'm teleporting you.
[15087.62s -> 15088.50s]  You gotta wait.
[15088.50s -> 15101.75s]  Oh there we go.
[15104.34s -> 15105.22s]  This is Bertie.
[15105.22s -> 15106.50s]  Bertie is on the ground.
[15106.50s -> 15106.90s]  He's hurt.
[15106.90s -> 15108.26s]  He needs help.
[15109.86s -> 15112.02s]  You're the younger brother with the disconnected controller.
[15114.17s -> 15114.49s]  Mom.
[15115.05s -> 15115.85s]  Mom I'm dying.
[15116.89s -> 15117.13s]  Mom.
[15130.18s -> 15130.58s]  Is he dead?
[15136.28s -> 15139.14s]  Is that funny?
[15139.14s -> 15140.02s]  Is that funny to you?
[15140.02s -> 15141.06s]  It was.
[15145.24s -> 15146.04s]  Okay psycho.
[15146.92s -> 15147.40s]  You there?
[15147.96s -> 15149.80s]  Yeah I'm just trying to reach your brother.
[15149.80s -> 15151.88s]  You just ruined that whole moment.
[15151.88s -> 15152.92s]  It was just ruined.
[15154.12s -> 15155.24s]  What do you mean ruined?
[15155.24s -> 15156.68s]  Oh look military med kit in here.
[15158.36s -> 15163.42s]  He was just talking on the phone and all of a sudden he's just like in your arms.
[15163.42s -> 15164.78s]  It's just like was so off.
[15166.38s -> 15167.18s]  Just abnormal.
[15167.18s -> 15167.82s]  It was just weird.
[15167.82s -> 15168.14s]  And if...
[15172.22s -> 15172.94s]  I apologize.
[15175.22s -> 15176.58s]  I won't ever make it weird again.
[15177.22s -> 15179.22s]  Okay we finally can continue.
[15180.34s -> 15186.94s]  We can do the story mission now.
[15186.94s -> 15187.98s]  We've unlocked Sophie.
[15188.62s -> 15194.73s]  Who's your favorite NPC so far?
[15198.49s -> 15199.77s]  I don't know any of their names.
[15201.34s -> 15202.38s]  You just said Sophie.
[15203.34s -> 15205.02s]  Yeah but I don't know if that's my favorite NPC.
[15209.72s -> 15210.12s]  Damn it.
[15210.68s -> 15213.88s]  Whatever we gotta go this way anyways.
[15214.81s -> 15215.61s]  No we're going right here.
[15223.40s -> 15224.36s]  Uh oh door shut.
[15226.25s -> 15226.73s]  Here we...
[15226.73s -> 15227.37s]  We have to do it now.
[15227.37s -> 15227.85s]  Danger.
[15229.11s -> 15230.47s]  Things are better for us now right?
[15231.27s -> 15232.15s]  Depends.
[15232.15s -> 15233.27s]  Oh are we...
[15233.27s -> 15233.67s]  Dentists?
[15233.67s -> 15234.55s]  That guy was a prick.
[15235.27s -> 15238.07s]  The PK were painted hands with him in charge.
[15238.07s -> 15239.51s]  Conclusion's pretty straightforward.
[15240.23s -> 15241.27s]  Lucas is gone.
[15241.27s -> 15242.87s]  She patching up his eye.
[15244.09s -> 15245.69s]  It'd be better if you just shut up.
[15245.69s -> 15246.33s]  Same eye.
[15246.33s -> 15247.13s]  It's gonna be the eye.
[15248.09s -> 15248.33s]  No.
[15249.38s -> 15249.70s]  Oh.
[15250.42s -> 15251.24s]  What were they doing?
[15251.24s -> 15252.12s]  What are you doing?
[15252.12s -> 15253.24s]  Spying on me?
[15253.24s -> 15255.78s]  Yeah I mean I thought it was weird too.
[15255.78s -> 15256.58s]  Wait why'd you trick...
[15256.58s -> 15257.54s]  He tricked us.
[15257.54s -> 15259.26s]  You were supposed to wait for me.
[15259.90s -> 15260.94s]  Supposed most.
[15260.94s -> 15261.66s]  Plans changed.
[15262.38s -> 15264.38s]  Afraid I was after your crystals huh?
[15264.38s -> 15265.43s]  Afraid?
[15265.43s -> 15266.58s]  Of you?
[15266.58s -> 15267.22s]  Would you get any...
[15267.22s -> 15268.82s]  What like if you had to get one of his tattoos?
[15268.82s -> 15269.46s]  What role again?
[15269.46s -> 15270.58s]  Just to look after Pilgrim.
[15270.58s -> 15271.08s]  Uh...
[15272.66s -> 15273.78s]  Maybe the card?
[15273.78s -> 15274.82s]  I don't know.
[15274.82s -> 15277.62s]  I'm getting the vi tattoo he has.
[15286.17s -> 15286.89s]  Okay cool.
[15287.53s -> 15290.95s]  He had a sunflower?
[15291.83s -> 15292.79s]  He did have a sunflower.
[15292.79s -> 15293.59s]  Oh shit.
[15293.59s -> 15294.39s]  I picked sunflower.
[15299.66s -> 15300.46s]  Alright finally.
[15305.35s -> 15305.83s]  Carl.
[15308.15s -> 15309.19s]  I didn't auto tattoo.
[15318.98s -> 15320.02s]  See I have the opposite problem.
[15320.02s -> 15321.30s]  My game is way too quiet.
[15321.30s -> 15322.42s]  It wasn't love at first sight.
[15323.14s -> 15324.50s]  Barney has his downsides.
[15325.22s -> 15327.78s]  But on the upside he is unshakably loyal.
[15328.90s -> 15329.14s]  Oh.
[15333.70s -> 15335.06s]  Ask about the conversation with Carl.
[15335.78s -> 15336.26s]  That's...
[15336.26s -> 15338.26s]  Let's just say the cause in short order.
[15339.14s -> 15340.82s]  Oh they're worried about water.
[15340.82s -> 15341.78s]  Oh my god.
[15341.78s -> 15343.38s]  Just fucking turn the faucet on.
[15344.90s -> 15346.50s]  Carl is this California or what?
[15349.67s -> 15351.03s]  Unruly brother.
[15351.59s -> 15355.16s]  Oh shit a scrapper hammer?
[15356.04s -> 15356.84s]  Alright.
[15356.84s -> 15357.96s]  We finally can leave.
[15361.24s -> 15363.40s]  Go to the meeting place with Jack and...
[15363.40s -> 15364.04s]  Who's Jack?
[15364.04s -> 15364.60s]  Who's Joe?
[15366.20s -> 15366.60s]  Come here.
[15366.60s -> 15367.00s]  Come here.
[15367.00s -> 15367.40s]  Come here.
[15367.40s -> 15368.12s]  Come here right now.
[15368.76s -> 15369.40s]  Come here right now.
[15369.40s -> 15370.44s]  You said somebody in your chat.
[15371.16s -> 15372.68s]  Someone in your chat said something.
[15373.50s -> 15373.98s]  What did they say?
[15373.98s -> 15374.38s]  Don't come...
[15374.38s -> 15375.26s]  Wait don't come in yet.
[15376.70s -> 15378.14s]  What did they say about somebody's head?
[15379.64s -> 15380.84s]  No one said anything.
[15380.84s -> 15381.24s]  They did.
[15381.24s -> 15382.36s]  What did they say?
[15382.36s -> 15385.16s]  They said something very specific about somebody's hair.
[15385.16s -> 15385.80s]  What did they say?
[15389.32s -> 15390.68s]  No one said anything.
[15390.68s -> 15393.24s]  Somebody in your chat mentioned how somebody has...
[15393.24s -> 15394.68s]  They all have the same hair.
[15396.86s -> 15397.74s]  That fucking...
[15397.74s -> 15399.02s]  That fucked up haircut?
[15399.66s -> 15401.46s]  You don't remember this conversation we had?
[15401.46s -> 15403.22s]  Like an hour ago they said that.
[15403.22s -> 15404.26s]  Come in here.
[15404.26s -> 15407.14s]  Oh okay I thought you were saying they're saying it now.
[15407.14s -> 15408.90s]  No like this they...
[15408.90s -> 15409.62s]  He was right.
[15409.62s -> 15410.18s]  They were right.
[15410.18s -> 15412.66s]  This guy yeah he does have that haircut.
[15412.66s -> 15414.42s]  Now that I think about it like...
[15415.30s -> 15417.78s]  Like four out of ten NPCs have this haircut.
[15417.78s -> 15418.18s]  You're right.
[15418.18s -> 15421.06s]  I actually saw this character earlier and I honestly was like...
[15421.06s -> 15424.34s]  If you looked like that in ten years I wouldn't be surprised.
[15424.34s -> 15424.84s]  What?
[15425.54s -> 15426.18s]  It kind of...
[15426.18s -> 15427.70s]  Like the face kind of looks like you.
[15429.14s -> 15431.30s]  You think I'm gonna look like this in ten years?
[15431.30s -> 15432.90s]  No I'm saying I wouldn't be surprised.
[15432.90s -> 15434.42s]  Like if you showed up you're like hey what's up?
[15434.42s -> 15436.34s]  And you like walked in and you were like a B.I.
[15436.34s -> 15438.74s]  I would be like oh okay.
[15438.74s -> 15439.54s]  I wouldn't...
[15440.70s -> 15441.90s]  With that hair though?
[15441.90s -> 15443.10s]  No my hair's not gonna do that.
[15443.10s -> 15445.88s]  No I'm not with that hair.
[15445.88s -> 15447.24s]  I'm not gonna look like that in ten years.
[15447.24s -> 15448.36s]  I'm gonna look smokin'.
[15450.84s -> 15451.56s]  I don't doubt it.
[15451.56s -> 15453.16s]  I just like it could go either way.
[15457.22s -> 15457.94s]  Well they could...
[15457.94s -> 15459.06s]  No actually I could see that.
[15460.50s -> 15461.46s]  Okay now you're on board.
[15461.46s -> 15462.82s]  I mean I love McDonald's.
[15462.82s -> 15463.46s]  I do.
[15463.46s -> 15464.34s]  That's not a joke.
[15464.98s -> 15465.62s]  What's the order?
[15466.18s -> 15467.19s]  The new order?
[15467.19s -> 15467.69s]  Okay.
[15468.71s -> 15473.64s]  Oh my god wait hold up hold up hold up hold that pot.
[15474.28s -> 15475.96s]  Press heal on me like start healing me.
[15475.96s -> 15477.00s]  Do I have bald head?
[15477.00s -> 15477.56s]  Do I have the hair?
[15482.55s -> 15483.43s]  Isn't that kind of weird?
[15483.43s -> 15483.91s]  That's weird.
[15484.63s -> 15487.83s]  If you like don't finish the heal it's like the World of Warcraft auto-follow.
[15488.63s -> 15489.19s]  That is weird.
[15492.30s -> 15493.50s]  Okay I'm gonna start using this.
[15493.50s -> 15495.18s]  Anyway what's McDonald's order?
[15495.18s -> 15495.98s]  McDonald's order.
[15496.38s -> 15503.34s]  Oh did they talk about this at the thing with the milkshake and the M&M's?
[15503.34s -> 15503.66s]  What?
[15505.29s -> 15507.05s]  I don't get an M&M milkshake.
[15507.05s -> 15507.93s]  What are you talking about?
[15507.93s -> 15509.77s]  An M&M McFlurry?
[15509.77s -> 15511.69s]  No I don't get ice cream with my order.
[15511.69s -> 15517.32s]  Okay well I'm just remembering from the thing that we did with the stuff and you know the place.
[15518.41s -> 15519.93s]  We had an M&M McFlurry?
[15521.27s -> 15524.95s]  No one of the German contestants said...
[15524.95s -> 15525.99s]  Oh oh oh.
[15525.99s -> 15529.83s]  That was a good order and I was like oh are you also an M&M McFlurry guy?
[15529.83s -> 15530.71s]  Okay okay.
[15533.13s -> 15533.53s]  Anyways.
[15533.53s -> 15535.45s]  A different terma sorry different terma.
[15535.45s -> 15538.57s]  Well there's always been me I'm the only one that's been here.
[15538.57s -> 15544.30s]  Yeah I know but we were gonna replace you like we had that thing going and like I'm glad
[15544.30s -> 15545.98s]  that we ended up not doing it.
[15545.98s -> 15547.58s]  No because that would be like weird.
[15548.54s -> 15550.30s]  Look I'm gonna retire I'll just say it right?
[15550.30s -> 15551.50s]  It's not like it's a big deal.
[15553.90s -> 15554.94s]  Good shot though.
[15554.94s -> 15556.78s]  Good job you got that uh you got that fucker.
[15558.22s -> 15562.57s]  Yeah that imposter was seriously like causing problems and stuff.
[15564.17s -> 15566.81s]  I'm just really glad that we don't have to worry about that that guy anymore.
[15567.45s -> 15568.97s]  What was his number?
[15568.97s -> 15571.72s]  Number 12 or something I don't know.
[15571.72s -> 15577.18s]  I'm not yeah but police let me off too because they were like well you know there's only like
[15577.18s -> 15580.14s]  one germa here the other guy wasn't even real.
[15580.14s -> 15582.87s]  Yeah that's fucked up.
[15582.87s -> 15583.99s]  It's just the number.
[15583.99s -> 15584.87s]  So that was fucked up.
[15586.65s -> 15588.41s]  All right so the McDonald's order.
[15589.13s -> 15593.77s]  I come back and this guy is like phasing through the wood.
[15593.77s -> 15595.05s]  I knew you were gonna kill him.
[15595.05s -> 15602.58s]  All right McDonald's wait 20 meters and we've got a thingy this way.
[15604.84s -> 15605.80s]  We're making progress.
[15606.60s -> 15608.92s]  Oh we got a thingy oh I never found the last thingy.
[15608.92s -> 15609.56s]  That's what I'm saying.
[15609.56s -> 15618.04s]  It's over it's over uh I'm playing hot and cold.
[15618.04s -> 15619.32s]  I see a window down here.
[15619.32s -> 15620.28s]  Yeah it's simply inside her.
[15620.92s -> 15621.59s]  No.
[15622.47s -> 15623.35s]  On either side of the building?
[15623.99s -> 15626.62s]  It's on this side.
[15626.62s -> 15628.58s]  It's inside the building.
[15628.58s -> 15630.02s]  It's got to be inside this building.
[15630.02s -> 15630.58s]  Yeah it's inside.
[15631.30s -> 15632.50s]  We got an entryway.
[15633.22s -> 15633.54s]  Latch.
[15633.54s -> 15634.02s]  You see any routes?
[15634.74s -> 15636.49s]  I don't see anything.
[15637.54s -> 15639.83s]  Ah ah I see bands.
[15639.83s -> 15640.71s]  Found it.
[15640.71s -> 15643.48s]  Buddies Sophie I'm sorry.
[15643.48s -> 15644.28s]  All right we got an entrance.
[15644.28s -> 15645.32s]  I knew it.
[15645.32s -> 15648.01s]  We'd betray us.
[15648.01s -> 15650.15s]  Fuck them Aiden.
[15650.15s -> 15650.63s]  Kill them all.
[15650.63s -> 15655.00s]  Okay so it's in the chemical.
[15655.00s -> 15655.80s]  Okay we gotta go.

[15659.08s -> 15659.56s]  I don't know.
[15661.32s -> 15661.56s]  No.
[15661.56s -> 15662.68s]  So no it's not.
[15662.68s -> 15663.80s]  I'm back out on the street.
[15663.80s -> 15664.84s]  Oh god damn.
[15664.84s -> 15666.36s]  No it's it's definitely in there up there.
[15668.18s -> 15669.14s]  Okay McDonald's order.
[15669.14s -> 15671.54s]  My McDonald's order is wait.
[15672.26s -> 15673.40s]  It's this way.
[15673.40s -> 15674.20s]  We're really close.
[15674.20s -> 15675.64s]  There's a guy I got a gold statue dude.
[15675.64s -> 15676.76s]  A crystal statue.
[15676.76s -> 15677.56s]  This is probably worth a lot.
[15678.20s -> 15682.44s]  I gotta go.
[15683.16s -> 15684.57s]  I don't know where I am.
[15685.91s -> 15687.67s]  Do something yeah scream or something in the game.
[15687.67s -> 15688.07s]  There you are.
[15688.07s -> 15691.67s]  Okay get up.
[15691.67s -> 15692.15s]  Get up.
[15692.79s -> 15695.59s]  Like right down here it's like two meters away.
[15695.59s -> 15696.71s]  I think I got it.
[15696.71s -> 15699.69s]  Yep oh we have to go up the stairs.
[15699.69s -> 15700.81s]  This is a chemical zone though.
[15702.02s -> 15702.82s]  Oh shit.
[15703.62s -> 15705.30s]  I don't know how you are where you are.
[15706.55s -> 15708.47s]  There's like a biohazard door here.
[15709.19s -> 15710.23s]  Walk from the inside.
[15711.51s -> 15712.87s]  It's a hard lock pick.
[15712.87s -> 15713.43s]  Oh no.
[15714.15s -> 15715.43s]  I'm about to be poisoned to death dude.
[15715.99s -> 15718.42s]  Do it.
[15718.42s -> 15719.06s]  You got this.
[15719.06s -> 15719.86s]  I got it.
[15719.86s -> 15722.31s]  Oh shit this door is locked.
[15722.31s -> 15724.73s]  What open it quick.
[15724.73s -> 15726.33s]  Another hard lock pick two in a row.
[15726.97s -> 15729.18s]  What the fuck dude.
[15729.82s -> 15732.23s]  We got a medium lock pick here.
[15732.23s -> 15732.63s]  Hi.
[15738.60s -> 15740.36s]  Got it got it got it got it got it.
[15740.36s -> 15741.64s]  There's nothing in this fucking thing.
[15741.64s -> 15742.52s]  This thing was stupid.
[15743.40s -> 15745.53s]  I got this one open.
[15747.32s -> 15748.52s]  Oh there's a sack in it.
[15748.52s -> 15749.32s]  Old world money.
[15749.88s -> 15750.20s]  Run.
[15751.02s -> 15752.30s]  Wait there's a crystal.
[15752.30s -> 15754.14s]  I thought there was an epic mace in there man.
[15754.86s -> 15757.48s]  Get that crystal.
[15759.10s -> 15759.98s]  What's this door.
[15759.98s -> 15760.62s]  I don't know get out.
[15761.26s -> 15762.78s]  Locked from inside.
[15762.78s -> 15763.34s]  Oh what.
[15764.94s -> 15766.62s]  Oh yeah there's like a nighttime quest here.
[15767.42s -> 15768.79s]  I'm dead down here.
[15768.79s -> 15769.43s]  I don't know where I am.
[15771.05s -> 15777.26s]  Oh my god.
[15777.26s -> 15780.33s]  Oops oops.
[15782.10s -> 15784.87s]  Okay pretty cool man.
[15786.38s -> 15788.30s]  That wasn't even that wasn't even the thing we're supposed to get.
[15789.69s -> 15791.29s]  Oh yes yeah that wasn't it.
[15792.55s -> 15793.19s]  Here see come.
[15794.73s -> 15796.57s]  This it was down the street.
[15798.66s -> 15800.58s]  Then you turn a right you make a right.
[15800.58s -> 15805.98s]  And then down this street it goes down to like three two one one.
[15807.02s -> 15808.06s]  Is it right here.
[15808.06s -> 15809.82s]  It's definitely it's right here to the right.
[15810.62s -> 15812.73s]  You can see behind this wall.
[15812.73s -> 15813.61s]  Can you.
[15813.61s -> 15814.65s]  Yeah it's right there.
[15814.65s -> 15815.69s]  Yeah you can.
[15816.41s -> 15817.61s]  Is there a way to get in from here.
[15818.41s -> 15819.74s]  Oh we got a cop car.
[15820.38s -> 15822.47s]  Not that many people there.
[15824.90s -> 15826.02s]  Oh the fucking order.
[15826.02s -> 15830.41s]  Okay what is this McDonald's order.
[15830.41s -> 15831.29s]  McDonald's order.
[15832.01s -> 15832.73s]  It has changed.
[15834.22s -> 15836.70s]  Before I had a huge order before.
[15836.70s -> 15838.14s]  But people misunderstood what I said.
[15839.02s -> 15841.90s]  It was like five sandwiches and like a bunch of McNuggets and stuff.
[15842.54s -> 15845.02s]  What people didn't understand was that was a group order.
[15845.90s -> 15847.74s]  That was supposed to be shared.
[15847.74s -> 15849.18s]  They didn't take into account the shareables.
[15851.21s -> 15852.81s]  You buy the nuggets for the group.
[15852.81s -> 15854.41s]  You buy an extra sandwich for the group.
[15854.41s -> 15856.65s]  In case somebody wants like a McChicken or whatever.
[15856.65s -> 15857.85s]  It's a family pack.
[15857.85s -> 15859.69s]  It's like a yeah essential.
[15861.51s -> 15863.83s]  The actual order is.
[15863.83s -> 15865.59s]  Are you ready get out your pen.
[15866.65s -> 15867.15s]  Coffee.
[15867.85s -> 15868.89s]  It is a.
[15868.89s -> 15869.39s]  Cheetos.
[15870.66s -> 15876.60s]  A medium 10 piece nugget meal with sweet and sour and honey mustard.
[15879.27s -> 15883.58s]  And then it's two double cheeseburgers not McDoubles.
[15883.58s -> 15887.08s]  Two double cheeseburgers without a pickle.
[15887.08s -> 15887.64s]  No pickle.
[15888.81s -> 15889.37s]  You lost me.
[15891.96s -> 15896.14s]  And a powerade.
[15896.14s -> 15897.58s]  And if I'm feeling a little bit.
[15898.90s -> 15900.02s]  If I'm feeling sloppy.
[15900.02s -> 15901.83s]  An apple pie.
[15901.83s -> 15904.15s]  If I'm kind of sloppy could go for the pie.
[15906.41s -> 15907.13s]  Okay.
[15907.13s -> 15910.04s]  I think that's pretty good.
[15910.04s -> 15910.60s]  No pickle.
[15910.60s -> 15912.04s]  No I don't I don't want pickles.
[15913.45s -> 15914.89s]  I like eating pickles individually.
[15914.89s -> 15918.97s]  I like pickles but McDonald's pickles I mean pretty low on the totem pole.
[15918.97s -> 15919.29s]  Exactly.
[15919.29s -> 15921.70s]  We got to kill these bandits down here.
[15921.70s -> 15923.46s]  I think that's our current situation.
[15923.46s -> 15926.42s]  I think we were talking to Sophie about some premeditated murder.
[15926.42s -> 15929.03s]  Okay.
[15929.03s -> 15930.47s]  What's your order from McDonald's?
[15931.93s -> 15934.73s]  My order from McDonald's is like go anywhere else.
[15936.17s -> 15938.38s]  You one of those people come on.
[15938.38s -> 15941.74s]  If I have to like if like gun to my head.
[15942.54s -> 15944.46s]  Two double quarter pounders with cheese.
[15944.46s -> 15945.02s]  Okay.
[15945.02s -> 15950.46s]  And no like no like made up extra stuff so that the person gets confused and is like
[15951.10s -> 15952.46s]  they're putting the pickles on anyway.
[15952.46s -> 15952.96s]  That's mine.
[15955.58s -> 15958.54s]  Like you can't go to McDonald's and say well I don't want to pick they're fucking putting
[15958.54s -> 15959.18s]  the pickles on.
[15959.18s -> 15961.10s]  No then they will take them off.
[15961.58s -> 15965.10s]  Shut up and like accept your pickles and then she takes the pickles off herself.
[15965.10s -> 15966.46s]  I think it's kind of weird too.
[15966.46s -> 15968.94s]  I like pickles so I'm not going to like make a big fuss about it.
[15973.08s -> 15977.16s]  I mean if it's tomatoes I'll tell them no tomatoes because that's like satanic.
[15978.57s -> 15978.97s]  Okay.
[15978.97s -> 15985.74s]  So you mentioned earlier that if you had a choice you wouldn't go to McDonald's.
[15985.74s -> 15987.74s]  So where would you where would you go instead?
[15987.74s -> 15990.46s]  Well when I lived in Boston you know this place Boston right.
[15990.46s -> 15991.98s]  Oh yeah I've watched it I know that shitty Boston.
[15991.98s -> 15995.26s]  Okay yeah so like there was a u-burger great place.
[15995.98s -> 15997.82s]  You know u-burger of course.
[15997.82s -> 15998.06s]  Yes.
[15998.06s -> 16001.02s]  And across the street there was a McDonald's and the McDonald's always had people walking
[16001.02s -> 16003.58s]  into it and I was like what a bunch of fucking morons right.
[16003.58s -> 16007.21s]  So it really depends on the location like in that case I'm going to u-burger.
[16007.21s -> 16011.05s]  But hold on hold on hold on you have got this all wrong.
[16011.05s -> 16013.53s]  I'm supporting local business wherever possible.
[16013.53s -> 16016.89s]  You got this all wrong here's first of all McDonald's is way faster than a restaurant
[16016.89s -> 16017.45s]  like u-burger.
[16018.70s -> 16022.14s]  You can literally drive to the drive-through or walk in and have your meal in literally
[16022.14s -> 16024.41s]  like 30 to 40 seconds.
[16024.41s -> 16026.01s]  Nice nice eye by the way.
[16026.01s -> 16027.85s]  Hopefully it heals like the rest of the entire world.
[16029.85s -> 16034.89s]  I was laughing I had a one of the gas tanks and it blew up during the cut scene.
[16034.89s -> 16036.66s]  It was right behind us.
[16036.66s -> 16037.62s]  I hope we're not dead.
[16037.62s -> 16038.26s]  Oh she's dead.
[16040.66s -> 16042.74s]  She died of a black right eye.
[16042.74s -> 16043.62s]  You did it again.
[16044.58s -> 16047.21s]  Oh my god anyways.
[16049.21s -> 16051.37s]  We'll talk about this after we fight the tyrant okay.
[16056.74s -> 16060.10s]  Oh yeah did you remember in dying light one the guy would always say oh fuck it fuck this
[16060.66s -> 16062.90s]  fucker just fucking guy was snotting his goon fucker.
[16071.37s -> 16074.81s]  I don't know how to change weapons back to my good weapon because it's my one weapon
[16074.81s -> 16077.21s]  but my one is my throwies.
[16077.21s -> 16079.29s]  Are you looking for crystals or are you making me do all the work?
[16079.85s -> 16081.29s]  Looking for crystals.
[16081.29s -> 16082.89s]  Yes that's the mission.
[16082.89s -> 16084.09s]  Oh I thought we got to kill the guy.
[16084.97s -> 16088.28s]  He just lit himself up he just walked right through the fire.
[16089.16s -> 16093.53s]  Yeah threw a bottle at him.
[16094.57s -> 16096.36s]  Oh wait what about this?
[16097.32s -> 16101.32s]  Okay so you were going to say something about my desire to support local business over McDonald's.
[16102.20s -> 16104.36s]  No what I said was there's a huge difference.
[16105.16s -> 16108.60s]  You burger is on a different tier than McDonald's is.
[16108.60s -> 16109.64s]  Are we doing a tier list?
[16109.64s -> 16113.72s]  That's like saying oh you know the local like authentic Italian restaurant down the street from
[16113.72s -> 16119.48s]  my house is what exactly versus but versus like a fast Italian like food place.
[16119.48s -> 16124.20s]  You always have a choice everyone's always like oh chipotle so like fucking
[16124.28s -> 16128.44s]  what chipotle is like wait the fence you want to you die on fences now.
[16129.72s -> 16130.44s]  What?
[16130.44s -> 16133.08s]  Like what people talk about chipotle.
[16133.08s -> 16137.72s]  Hold on I just I just threw this tank at him and did half his health by hitting him in the head.
[16138.84s -> 16140.12s]  Okay we'll do it again.
[16140.12s -> 16147.69s]  All right listen to me it's the how much it costs how fast it is how are you in a hurry
[16147.69s -> 16152.01s]  do you want to sit down at like a restaurant right like because you could order takeout
[16152.01s -> 16156.25s]  from some of these places but it's it's not the same as getting like a cheeseburger from McDonald's.
[16156.25s -> 16157.77s]  Okay well what is a ron?
[16158.81s -> 16159.29s]  A what?
[16160.09s -> 16163.21s]  You can go in and you sit down and you can rest but you can also ron.
[16164.33s -> 16164.73s]  Ron?
[16165.61s -> 16176.49s]  Ron restaurant like which like trick or treat I understand that restaurant I don't understand.
[16176.49s -> 16179.13s]  But anyway let's get back to the point that we were making before.
[16179.77s -> 16183.78s]  Very important point McDonald's and you burger are not on the same tier of restaurant.
[16185.90s -> 16189.26s]  In fact I would probably assume that's what I'm saying though is
[16190.38s -> 16193.66s]  that's exactly what I'm saying you get to choose the tier of place you go.
[16193.66s -> 16196.78s]  Yes but the different tiers exist for very specific reasons.
[16196.78s -> 16199.82s]  You get McDonald's within like five minutes of walking in the restaurant.
[16199.82s -> 16201.58s]  New burger is fast food as well.
[16202.22s -> 16204.86s]  But it's not it's not the same fast food.
[16204.86s -> 16207.18s]  It's gonna get better and it's probably more expensive.
[16211.48s -> 16216.84s]  Probably how much how much is a single like I don't know I've been years since I've done.
[16217.64s -> 16221.53s]  Okay but it's more expensive and it's gonna take a little longer to get your food.
[16221.53s -> 16223.37s]  So if you okay you got 20 minutes.
[16224.01s -> 16226.65s]  Oh shit okay there's a you burger right here there's McDonald's right here.
[16226.65s -> 16229.93s]  I have literally 20 minutes before I have to go to my thing I'm doing.
[16229.93s -> 16232.09s]  You're not gonna go order like a burger from you burger
[16232.09s -> 16233.61s]  because it's gonna take it's gonna take a little longer.
[16234.33s -> 16236.17s]  It doesn't take 20 minutes.
[16236.89s -> 16240.65s]  But you want to make sure that you can just get in there get your two double cheeseburgers.
[16240.65s -> 16243.61s]  Have you ever shown up on time for anything you're going to you burger?
[16244.49s -> 16247.45s]  Oh I might be like 10 minutes late.
[16247.45s -> 16250.25s]  Like you're you're not thinking about this when you're going into the restaurant.
[16255.00s -> 16257.72s]  All right but the point still stands.
[16259.30s -> 16262.09s]  There are oh movement speed.
[16266.38s -> 16273.98s]  McDonald's there's a tier McDonald's Wendy's Burger King Carl's Jr. Arby's.
[16273.98s -> 16276.94s]  This tier I'm morally opposed to the tier.
[16276.94s -> 16278.54s]  You'd go to Arby's wouldn't you?
[16278.54s -> 16279.82s]  You'd go to Arby's wouldn't you?
[16279.90s -> 16280.22s]  Say it.
[16280.22s -> 16281.90s]  I've actually had a really good Arby's sandwich.
[16281.90s -> 16284.78s]  Oh and look at that he's gonna go to Arby's instead of McDonald's.
[16284.78s -> 16286.38s]  That's exactly what I was talking about.
[16286.38s -> 16288.38s]  I went to Arby's over McDonald's.
[16288.38s -> 16289.98s]  I'm sorry like was that a problem?
[16289.98s -> 16291.82s]  Yeah that's actually a huge problem.
[16291.82s -> 16292.94s]  I took Carl hostage.
[16292.94s -> 16293.82s]  What's wrong with Arby's?
[16294.78s -> 16295.26s]  It's all right.
[16295.98s -> 16297.90s]  Exactly I'm helping Sophie get him back.
[16300.79s -> 16303.67s]  I knew you were gonna be a guy that was gonna go to Arby's instead of McDonald's.
[16303.67s -> 16306.31s]  I mean Arby's I've only ever been like once.
[16307.19s -> 16310.63s]  Okay I've only been to Arby's because going on like
[16311.11s -> 16317.51s]  a bus like an actual public transport bus between Boston and New York they would stop at an Arby's
[16318.55s -> 16322.39s]  and it's like hey if you guys want food we're stopping at Arby's you don't have a choice.
[16323.70s -> 16324.90s]  So what did you get at Arby's?
[16326.20s -> 16330.20s]  I don't know I don't even know what any of their sandwiches are called.
[16330.20s -> 16331.56s]  Have you been to Jack in the Box before?
[16333.75s -> 16337.83s]  Jack in the Box and Sonic which I think are the same place both kind of just grossed me out and
[16337.83s -> 16339.03s]  I don't think I've ever been.
[16339.03s -> 16340.23s]  You're right about Sonic.
[16340.23s -> 16341.43s]  You got Sonic correct.
[16341.51s -> 16343.19s]  Is Jack in the Box another IHOP?
[16343.83s -> 16344.07s]  No.
[16345.22s -> 16347.70s]  Oh no there's Jack in the Box is not equivalent.
[16347.70s -> 16349.54s]  There's like Jenny's IHOP and Jack in the Box.
[16349.54s -> 16351.30s]  No no no he's wrong again.
[16351.30s -> 16354.10s]  Okay listen Jack in the Box is like a McDonald's.
[16354.10s -> 16356.74s]  I've I've never been so I'm just okay.
[16356.74s -> 16360.66s]  Jack in the Box is like a McDonald's but they have literally every food ever invented.
[16360.66s -> 16363.14s]  I think you can order fucking spaghetti at Jack in the Box.
[16363.14s -> 16365.14s]  Besides that did you have to do that?
[16367.37s -> 16369.90s]  No I didn't know.
[16372.12s -> 16372.84s]  Come help me.
[16373.56s -> 16384.25s]  Okay so we have to go to a trashy fast food like we have to.
[16384.25s -> 16385.93s]  There's no it has to happen.
[16385.93s -> 16387.53s]  What is your number one pick?
[16387.53s -> 16389.45s]  It's always McDonald's always.
[16389.45s -> 16390.73s]  Well how is it always McDonald's?
[16390.73s -> 16394.33s]  Because I like McDonald's and it's consistent and it's fun and it's delicious
[16394.33s -> 16397.45s]  and they had a clown it was Ronald McDonald's like really cool and
[16397.45s -> 16400.73s]  if you're going to McDonald's because of the marketing because of the clown.
[16400.73s -> 16403.21s]  Ronald McDonald's like cool and they got rid of them.
[16404.33s -> 16408.01s]  Have you guys noticed this they stir when was the last time you you don't go to McDonald's
[16408.01s -> 16409.05s]  so you do you can't relate to this.
[16410.76s -> 16414.60s]  I mean they're everywhere so I've seen them but no I understand Ronald McDonald's is really
[16414.60s -> 16415.96s]  they're kind of phasing them out.
[16415.96s -> 16419.08s]  Yeah they turned McDonald's into like a weird little like cafe.
[16419.88s -> 16422.52s]  They took out all the McDonald's there's no more grimace.
[16423.42s -> 16427.82s]  I I do feel like they're trying to Starbucks it up.
[16427.82s -> 16429.50s]  I I I get what you're saying there.
[16430.14s -> 16435.02s]  The food is still it's still the same though but they're trying to get rid of Ronald McDonald's
[16435.02s -> 16439.54s]  and they're replacing him with like yeah like a Starbucks window.
[16442.36s -> 16445.56s]  I don't think they did him I you know if they want how would this you know what I would have
[16445.56s -> 16450.84s]  been okay with if Ronald McDonald took the makeup off and he was Ronald and it was like look he's
[16450.84s -> 16455.72s]  a regular guy it's like Ron like Ronald like have him take the makeup off and just be like
[16455.72s -> 16458.12s]  a regular guy like what's the problem why do you have to get rid of him.
[16458.84s -> 16462.28s]  I don't know I could I could be down with a Ronald.
[16462.28s -> 16467.22s]  Like you know that he like puts the makeup on and like this like makes like people happy and stuff
[16467.22s -> 16473.51s]  but stop throwing bombs at me that would be creepy what
[16475.43s -> 16484.31s]  my god please the zombies over there got a couple dead yeah he would be Ronald McDonald right
[16485.11s -> 16489.40s]  like but if we just he wouldn't be the clown he'd be like a regular guy with
[16490.20s -> 16492.92s]  maybe they could keep the hair I don't I don't know what they would do
[16495.37s -> 16502.86s]  keep the nose I'm surprised like there's one thing in my life it's okay it's probably a
[16502.86s -> 16506.38s]  problem with me there's probably a lot of people that have no problem with us if someone orders
[16506.38s -> 16513.98s]  food they're like a an order food app yeah and it's McDonald's I'm like morally posed and there's
[16513.98s -> 16519.10s]  a nauseated disgusting feeling in the put in my stomach really yeah to see like oh here's your
[16519.10s -> 16527.58s]  delivery with like the McDonald's M on it it's just like you would you stay friends with this person
[16528.30s -> 16535.10s]  I wouldn't have you would you would avoid this fucking person we would you've definitely done
[16535.10s -> 16539.02s]  yeah we would avoid this person but this is what I'm saying you're like oh there's just 20 minutes
[16539.02s -> 16543.98s]  do you stop at a McDonald's okay you can order food from anywhere a person will magically appear
[16543.98s -> 16548.62s]  and be generated by the universe bring it to your door and then like disassemble as they leave
[16548.62s -> 16554.78s]  and you chose McDonald's oh but but what if it's not enough what if they're not open some
[16555.74s -> 16561.58s]  McDonald's is open if nothing else is open but when is nothing else but McDonald's open
[16561.58s -> 16564.94s]  I guarantee I get this in the window or I'll give a hundred community stops
[16566.14s -> 16573.88s]  thank you the point is if you are going to be in a scenario where you need something fast
[16574.52s -> 16580.50s]  yeah you don't have to order like uber eats McDonald's all the time right but McDonald's
[16580.50s -> 16585.06s]  is usually faster than all of them is usually cheaper than all of them but I like it so that's
[16585.06s -> 16596.34s]  all I have to say what is your argument is if there's you could just say you like it I like
[16596.34s -> 16601.14s]  the dogs you can be wrong it's cool it's not being wrong oh I think less of you but
[16602.10s -> 16608.87s]  okay then you have to answer me this question yeah McDonald's Burger King Wendy's Jack in the
[16608.87s -> 16615.43s]  Box Arby's where are you going if you had to pick one if I had to pick one of those
[16616.31s -> 16624.09s]  I think every time that's fair I think this guy's we're gonna kill this guy
[16624.09s -> 16636.66s]  permission that's fair will you help me kill this guy yeah hold on I thought you just puked
[16636.66s -> 16646.58s]  because like you thought he was gross I don't have enough stamina for these there's another
[16646.58s -> 16657.64s]  thing over here but no fast food I genuinely like McDonald's there's something else with it too
[16657.64s -> 16662.68s]  and you can call me oh cringe cringe cringe cringe Andy well I don't know when I was a kid
[16663.32s -> 16669.00s]  going to McDonald's was oh let's get I'm gonna get like five four nuggets I'm gonna get a happy meal
[16669.80s -> 16676.34s]  it's like a comfort food it's like oh yeah I like I love the nuggets from the comments right
[16677.14s -> 16682.02s]  doesn't have to be like restaurant quality high quality well it is a restaurant so it's
[16682.02s -> 16687.70s]  it is restaurant quality but which one would you choose restaurant if I wanted to go sit at a
[16687.70s -> 16696.14s]  restaurant of course my palate is enormous I'm dying hold up I have such a sophisticated palette
[16696.14s -> 16702.78s]  I could eat like the nicest sushi in the world and then have an uber eats delivered to the
[16702.78s -> 16709.30s]  restaurant at McDouble and I would be really happy about it oh what's this oh salmon sashimi
[16709.30s -> 16714.50s]  oh my god it's so buttery in your mouth oh yeah the orders over here for me yeah I had the 10
[16714.50s -> 16726.60s]  nuggets and the two cheeseburgers how did I get in here you know what it's fine you can like what
[16726.60s -> 16733.02s]  you like the person that said the venom movie was terrible and that he was pissed that it even came

[16739.38s -> 16744.68s]  was terrible and all if you would like the venom movie you're an idiot remember that one I didn't
[16744.68s -> 16756.54s]  say that but I wouldn't disagree what the fuck are we doing like where are you I've been doing

[17277.70s -> 17282.26s]  what yourself up here this is what you did yeah and you're like
[17282.26s -> 17302.20s]  what did you do it I didn't hear anything it's like you just screamed in my face and I don't
[17302.20s -> 17308.50s]  hear that that's like I'm baiting you that has to be bullshit right yeah no I'm pretty sure discord
[17308.50s -> 17313.30s]  will like you can do stuff like you can snap your fingers if you're not talking and the snap won't
[17313.30s -> 17317.54s]  go through discord that was ridiculous but you screamed for so long you would think it would come
[17317.54s -> 17324.58s]  through yeah I thought like a little like even the beginning of it would but no are we in like
[17324.58s -> 17332.42s]  a dream yeah we are you got any you got any opinions on dreams that I don't know about I
[17332.42s -> 17337.78s]  feel like that's a thing you'd have a like a whole bit about what about dreaming yeah I don't know
[17337.78s -> 17342.74s]  it just seems like a thing that you'd be into I mean it's kind of interesting that we do that
[17342.74s -> 17348.02s]  our brains are so overactive that even while they're turned off they have to be functioning
[17348.02s -> 17358.54s]  and have to be doing things like a shark it's pretty weird oh is this like where we remember
[17358.54s -> 17361.90s]  that the girl we've been looking for this whole time actually burned alive and we don't need to
[17361.90s -> 17368.97s]  look for anymore and the game's over it's weird why that guy show up yeah is he a part of the dream
[17369.61s -> 17376.89s]  are you downloading um lego star wars angry birds whatever it was uh no I had a bad feeling about
[17376.89s -> 17389.43s]  it from the start he kind of lied to us then I said I would try anything once I did oh I mean
[17389.43s -> 17394.47s]  like I like if someone put it in front of me I would try it was a whole other story when you
[17394.47s -> 17399.03s]  don't like you gotta like if you manage to take out those I don't have an ipad jack cock this
[17399.03s -> 17415.94s]  game's fun okay meat has anyone ever told you it's weird that you call them community subs
[17415.94s -> 17424.74s]  by peace immunity subs yeah like community gifted subs I've never heard anyone say that ever and do
[17424.74s -> 17432.90s]  me a favor um scroll over the uh the gifted sub I'm sure that's what the full like long
[17433.54s -> 17439.14s]  exact phrasing of it is I'm sure it is but it seems weird like when you could say like gifted
[17439.14s -> 17443.78s]  subs oh but it's the same that's literally the definition of what it is it's a community sub
[17443.78s -> 17450.17s]  it's a gifted community it's a community sub I'm not disagreeing oh what do you call it a
[17450.17s -> 17454.89s]  gift thanks for the gifted subs thanks for the community subs gift it just gifted it's shorter
[17455.53s -> 17462.50s]  yeah but I mean it's classified as a community sub there are prime subs right there are community
[17462.50s -> 17467.22s]  subs and then there are like regular subs right but but when when the thing happens it will say
[17467.22s -> 17476.36s]  so-and-so gifted 10 subs they gifted a gifted 10 community subs are we reaching for like content
[17476.36s -> 17481.58s]  right now for like funny things no I was I thought there was one of those things there
[17482.54s -> 17487.50s]  oh there is okay watch out guys we got one of those things there is a tutorial area
[17488.44s -> 17494.97s]  oh it's 40 meters oh it comes to chase let's see what you have what it takes to beat me
[17495.77s -> 17507.67s]  I'm fucking done I'm done I'm being chased what happened you're dying I got tutorial yeah you're
[17507.67s -> 17513.27s]  dying in the oh there's like a super monster above you I think that's like an ultra volatile oh

[17531.78s -> 17538.28s]  way more time I lost 113 community subs for that and I thought you're gonna say I lost like 10
[17538.28s -> 17554.46s]  quarts of blood I'm being chased oh it is like a super mutant do you want to try to kill him
[17555.10s -> 17560.46s]  I don't think we can I think so volatile it's kind of right in the way that I want to go
[17561.18s -> 17564.62s]  unless we run from him for like six hours and he falls into a fence you can't kill him
[17565.26s -> 17571.08s]  it's a container right here I don't know you probably don't care though I'm coming back to
[17571.08s -> 17575.88s]  you I made a loop around I lost him it's he's over here the big super mutant guys over here
[17576.76s -> 17582.84s]  he's he literally can see us right now he can see you they can't people saying that we can
[17582.84s -> 17590.23s]  people said we can kill this thing easily they think we're overreacting okay let's do it I'm

[18104.23s -> 18110.25s]  are you able to repair weapons I don't think so maybe I thought there was like a repair kit
[18110.89s -> 18121.13s]  thing just a hater delirious to it who am I hating McDonald's why you had you just you said like
[18121.13s -> 18135.35s]  three times you hate McDonald's um we should do this it's right here no repairs you got to craft
[18135.35s -> 18144.94s]  all that shit on your weapon then it breaks and you got to do it again every time are you aware
[18144.94s -> 18152.71s]  of what IGN's game of all time is ocarina of time they made a revised list of their game
[18153.67s -> 18161.29s]  I just I don't know what what was number one breath of the wild is now the new best game of all time
[18161.29s -> 18171.16s]  isn't yeah what's in the top five is there more than there I can't remember it was all very
[18171.16s -> 18177.22s]  upsetting but isn't breath of the wild and clicks isn't breath of the wild supposed to be really
[18177.38s -> 18182.42s]  good how could breath of the wild be any good when it all it did was coffee genshin in fact
[18182.42s -> 18187.96s]  would you rather it be ocarina of time can we be honest I would feel like I could see where they
[18187.96s -> 18195.32s]  were coming from if it was ocarina of time right but like it's ocarina of time is what everybody
[18195.32s -> 18201.08s]  says I get it's ocarina of time the best game ever made in all of history is on the Nintendo
[18201.08s -> 18210.14s]  switch so what oh turn turn around and look is this what you're saying look at how beautiful the
[18210.14s -> 18215.10s]  graphics are it's so wonderful this wouldn't run on a switch that's what you're saying so a game
[18215.10s -> 18219.98s]  can't be good if it has like not incredible beautiful I would say 10 out of 10 direct x12
[18219.98s -> 18225.34s]  I think graphics with the foliage the entire history of game development if you really think
[18225.34s -> 18232.73s]  about like what is the best thing if you just narrowed it down to what like what's your favorite
[18232.73s -> 18240.15s]  game of all time favorite game of all time yeah hide the sausage what the fuck is that
[18240.87s -> 18254.54s]  I mean you could play that on anything what's your favorite video game of all time I'm jumping
[18254.54s -> 18263.14s]  why are you jumping it got blocked we're gonna go down there to meet Sophie uh favorite video
[18263.14s -> 18270.84s]  game of all time you alive yes okay if ocarina of time is is acceptable to you breath of the
[18270.84s -> 18278.60s]  wild is not acceptable to you what is acceptable to you as number one like you what is your number
[18278.60s -> 18283.48s]  one like or at least something in the top well no this is about what is acceptable to me or what
[18283.48s -> 18288.60s]  I would choose what would you choose is not the best game of all time okay so what if I had to
[18288.60s -> 18294.68s]  wait a minute most acceptable one so you're saying that people have opinions yeah people
[18294.68s -> 18299.32s]  have opinions okay so what is your favorite McDonald's what's your favorite game of all time
[18299.32s -> 18308.07s]  um I feel like I'm gonna forget because I haven't ever like played one I could tell you but mine is
[18308.79s -> 18317.35s]  if it doesn't help you if it's Diablo 2 or like Bloodborne wait you close you had it it's I had
[18317.35s -> 18322.97s]  it it's probably Bloodborne that's probably my favorite game of all time but the reason why I'm
[18322.97s -> 18331.13s]  saying maybe not is because it only released on ps4 at 30 fps yeah it's just like it yeah so like
[18331.13s -> 18336.01s]  wouldn't it suck if the best game of all time was only on the Nintendo Switch yeah but still it
[18336.01s -> 18341.37s]  Bloodborne is like sorry for Bloodborne it's making you question it Diablo 2 the wild you're
[18341.37s -> 18347.62s]  like I don't know because I don't because I don't particularly because you don't want to
[18347.62s -> 18350.74s]  pick this fight because there's people in chat that are like me your breath of wild and you
[18350.74s -> 18356.50s]  don't want to like upset them and but you'll be like all Bloodborne sir I I talked a like a full
[18357.06s -> 18362.63s]  college essay about how I don't like the Zelda games so you're barking up the absolute wrong tree
[18368.94s -> 18377.42s]  Diablo 2 Team Fortress 2 and Bloodborne and um
[18377.42s -> 18383.06s]  that goes pretty damn good but that's not it was it was a fun list because of how lazy it looks
[18383.06s -> 18388.50s]  like around number 50 is all of the blizzard games it's just like oh I don't know Starcraft
[18388.50s -> 18394.98s]  Diablo World of Warcraft like whatever it's just one blizzard game that was made by Blizzard North
[18394.98s -> 18400.44s]  like 25 years ago I'm gonna hit you with this because you're a big fan okay World of Warcraft
[18400.44s -> 18406.60s]  was like top 50 in this top 100 list game of all times yeah I agree I think around top 10 or 20
[18406.60s -> 18412.66s]  was Final Fantasy 14 it's got the most guards are we talking about like cultural impact are we talking
[18412.66s -> 18418.31s]  just like what game was actually the best like video game I don't know I think I think it was
[18418.31s -> 18424.54s]  the best that still holds up if anything goes wrong we retreat to our base okay well you're
[18424.54s -> 18429.19s]  you're dashing you're dashing that you're you're dodging the question I'm dashing I'm dodging
[18429.19s -> 18433.99s]  what is your favorite game of all time I think it actually would be like the other two are
[18433.99s -> 18441.53s]  Bloodborne oh we're on the same page here so we completely agree okay yeah that's why we know
[18441.53s -> 18449.24s]  we're both right oh that's how we know our opinion is correct because we both have it oh yeah okay
[18449.24s -> 18453.16s]  like if anyone else were to come into the conversation and that's and that's not a
[18453.16s -> 18459.53s]  problem right that's not a problem well we have majority yeah you and I have the same opinion
[18459.53s -> 18467.35s]  therefore it's correct that's kind of how it works we're doing monkey bars right now kind of
[18467.35s -> 18476.36s]  I'm just I'm just vibing man all right so here you go so Diablo 2 obviously right uh blizzard
[18476.36s -> 18480.68s]  blizzard game yeah blizzard game why is it telling me how to do stealth right now we're getting a lot
[18480.68s -> 18491.93s]  of these we're getting a lot of these why does this game have four tutorials Jack and Jack and Joe's
[18491.93s -> 18508.44s]  camp is this Joe who is this that might be Joe behind you this is the same guy I think that
[18508.44s -> 18515.75s]  guy's on our side the warrior wait whose team are we on I don't know I think we're on blue
[18517.35s -> 18523.16s]  did you just hit me who's this person you're dying man

[18550.90s -> 18562.66s]  oh I don't usually going back up here no I don't want to eat that I have a question
[18564.98s -> 18570.70s]  no uh what what are these pointed spikes preventing from coming forward like what
[18570.70s -> 18577.32s]  is this preventing helicopters uh like an orc invasion they're like things that they they put
[18577.32s -> 18587.27s]  on the side to climb up the building all right so we gotta we gotta go kill the jack and joe uh
[18587.27s -> 18596.71s]  jumpers oh we got jumpers that's true they do jump that guy has a one of those tape measure son

[19328.84s -> 19336.38s]  I don't think so I remember that being a thing though if you had at least I've told the story
[19336.38s -> 19341.67s]  before but I'm telling it again if you had at least A or B average and you brought your report
[19341.67s -> 19346.86s]  card to Chuck E Cheese they would give you like 20 free tokens and it was a huge deal to every kid
[19346.86s -> 19352.66s]  and in the in the town and neighborhood whatever it was like oh I get free tokens Chuck E Cheese
[19352.66s -> 19358.76s]  so I would I had a brother and sister obviously right so we would go and I would have like Ds
[19358.76s -> 19364.26s]  and Cs I was a fucking dumb kid right and they would always just kind of lump me in with my
[19364.26s -> 19369.05s]  brother and sister that had A's and B's so I'd be like oh here's your report card you've got oh

[19390.90s -> 19399.06s]  not sorry dumb kids don't get tokens yeah sorry idiots don't get anything why don't you try a
[19399.06s -> 19405.58s]  little harder and I wonder if I thought my report card was good I was like yeah I did good in school

[19553.02s -> 19557.42s]  you just have a hole opening up to the outside of your house no it has a flap like a dog door
[19557.42s -> 19561.34s]  that's fine but anybody can just go through it so that's fine and you and you wake up one morning
[19561.34s -> 19568.78s]  and like your ps5 is gone and so is your tv okay your like just open side of your house
[19569.50s -> 19578.34s]  is cool until um until the ps5 is gone you can't like lock that you you you couldn't lock it
[19578.34s -> 19584.66s]  you're talking about putting a bike lock on a ps5 no on the door flap there's no conceivable
[19584.66s -> 19593.67s]  way that you could prevent someone from crawling in from the outside I mean yeah it's called a door
[19593.67s -> 19601.21s]  with a lock on it the door has a lock on it and also you can like slide down a covering for the
[19601.21s -> 19609.08s]  homie hole like I'm not expecting any homies today so you lock you close it so why don't you
[19609.08s -> 19615.38s]  just have a door to your house I would have it open as often as possible would you have the
[19615.38s -> 19622.44s]  front door to your house open all day all day all day uh yeah okay well then never mind do you like
[19622.44s -> 19627.16s]  just not trust people you just failed that by the way let a real lock pick over here please

[19644.86s -> 19651.21s]  ask what is every game has these doors that look like they're like sliding doors that come down
[19651.21s -> 19658.76s]  that are like this is the locked line door yeah why because it's to convey that you cannot go
[19658.76s -> 19664.76s]  through here because there's nothing to open but these kinds of doors don't exist yeah they do
[19664.76s -> 19670.65s]  only in hotel rooms and then you get embarrassed taking a shit in that room because it actually
[19670.65s -> 19675.91s]  doesn't even close it's like sliding like a closet door closed and you're like I don't want
[19675.91s -> 19680.63s]  to take a shit in here I have no idea what you're talking about the only time I've ever seen a

[20467.26s -> 20474.14s]  you're doing what I don't know what you didn't say you were working for eight
[20474.14s -> 20483.21s]  I don't work so no one can remain neutral in this for survival without water the whole bizarre
[20483.21s -> 20488.65s]  will die in under a month the peacekeepers they won't help us just like when my mom died
[20488.65s -> 20514.30s]  what are you laughing at you're just a funny guy what try me yeah try me tell me who killed
[20514.30s -> 20519.82s]  who are these people the more things we did it waste of time shoot this is your last chance
[20519.82s -> 20523.98s]  sophie tell me who killed lucas before I break down this door what are you donkey kong this
[20523.98s -> 20528.30s]  just made it a steal but this does remind me of my favorite scene ever from one of my favorite
[20528.30s -> 20536.65s]  shows of all time the crazy new adventures of I came first name I couldn't I tried to stall
[20537.37s -> 20544.63s]  what Sabrina the teenage witch he has the new show my favorite scene of all time in all television
[20544.63s -> 20553.85s]  ever is is what happened yes oh man she like she just acts like she's so incredible all the time
[20553.85s -> 20557.77s]  and she just walks into rooms and solves the problems instantly but there's one part of the
[20557.77s -> 20561.45s]  show where she walks into this room is like I'm here Sabrina's gonna stop and they just
[20562.17s -> 20566.17s]  instantly cut to her getting shot with the crossbow and like the people just don't listen to her
[20566.17s -> 20580.41s]  what that's kind of funny yeah it is it's very very comedic timing what the hell you are supposed
[20580.41s -> 20585.50s]  to launch off of it chat was right I thought they were bullshitting me yeah you have to jump off
[20585.50s -> 20597.00s]  of it is that in the Olympics pole vaulting oh if I okay if I type in like what do you say the show
[20597.00s -> 20604.54s]  is so then whatever the new Sabrina the teenage which is where she's like hip and edgy on Sabrina
[20604.54s -> 20612.36s]  the teenage witch crossbow maybe you'll find it I find it if you find it I it's one of those things
[20612.36s -> 20618.15s]  I like rewatched like 10 times in a row but it really helps when you have the buildup of like how
[20618.15s -> 20626.76s]  this has gone in her favor for like three seasons oh I can't I don't I can't find it I'll try and
[20626.76s -> 20631.00s]  find it one day if you can find it uh I'd love to see your favorite joke of all time
[20633.22s -> 20637.14s]  it's gonna yeah I build it up it's gonna be a huge letdown you know how the situation goes
[20640.17s -> 20646.65s]  I don't think so some I can't something about this game means that I can't click anything on
[20646.65s -> 20654.22s]  my other monitors even when they're active oh should I what's wrong with my body oh the chase
[20654.22s -> 20668.42s]  has died the fuck is this a zombie merchant what the fuck get off of me I'm hurry chat found it
[20668.42s -> 20672.26s]  yeah I'm sure they googled Sabrina crossbow and that's what I did I couldn't find it
[20673.06s -> 20678.98s]  I mean even you wouldn't know I'm really far away from you that's not one of those I'm dead
[20681.26s -> 20687.11s]  was seriously the same exact color scheme as all this shit it's blue and white and it was like look
[20687.11s -> 20693.27s]  blue and white on this plank of wood that was not my fault where are you that I'm dead over here
[20693.99s -> 20702.62s]  that really did look like it was one of those things oh you jumped and okay you're dead yeah
[20702.62s -> 20709.75s]  but it looked like it was one of those safe x thingies blue and white and we found it's the
[20709.75s -> 20721.61s]  first 30 seconds of this right here oh I think somebody's got it did I watch do we watch this on
[20721.61s -> 20729.62s]  stream yeah go for it so this is the funniest thing you've ever seen you said right not the
[20729.62s -> 20735.78s]  funniest thing is just my favorite thing from tv well okay that's not fair it's like my favorite
[20735.78s -> 20740.89s]  thing that I don't think was supposed to be funny I'm gonna add a whole bunch of qualifiers as I
[20740.89s -> 20746.44s]  remember that like always sunny exists and there's actually like funny tv shows hold on
[20752.39s -> 20756.23s]  we're about to watch it on my stream if you want to come over you can give some commentary if you
[20756.23s -> 20769.02s]  want I need the context man okay so I'm at like 15 seconds or so I don't know if this is like a
[20769.02s -> 20773.34s]  spoiler for a Sabrina the teenage witch and it probably is would you call this a spoiler
[20773.34s -> 20780.74s]  as long as you it's not a spoiler as long as you like stop watching after she gets shot
[20780.74s -> 20791.22s]  okay all right so this is it right here are you ready I can't click on anything on my computer
[20791.22s -> 20802.76s]  okay what it was before that
[20822.79s -> 20835.11s]  I mean that's not is that the funniest thing you've ever seen it's up there I didn't even
[20835.11s -> 20838.07s]  know that's what I didn't know what Sabrina even looked like I thought that was another character
[20838.63s -> 20850.92s]  and see look white blue white blue the thing that I jumped on was white blue all right are you
[20850.92s -> 20866.92s]  where are you I like ran all the way to a safe house it was I'm telling you you didn't see the
[20866.92s -> 20872.04s]  like two seasons before that where she shows up and every problem is solved because she's Sabrina
[20872.04s -> 20877.72s]  is it literally just fucking get shot and died is it a good show you I guess you've watched
[20877.72s -> 20882.76s]  through two full seasons of the show is it good I've seen it all she um I think we're gonna get
[20882.76s -> 20894.33s]  married like is it is the show a good show I like can't say yes but I love how fucking
[20894.33s -> 20904.06s]  dumb it can be like I like love it as a basically video candidate pretty much like really I love
[20904.06s -> 20911.18s]  love it yeah really okay there's one episode that I don't even like describing it is is going to be
[20911.18s -> 20918.95s]  it's going to be too much we potentially see another basically on this uh show I have a
[20918.95s -> 20925.38s]  basically half made still oh I ever show it to you I think you did I need to finish that it's
[20925.38s -> 20932.28s]  a good one if I need to actually finish it yeah yeah it's been like a year of it being half done
[20933.00s -> 20944.12s]  all right so we're safe here yeah we're safe I'll get the honey and stuff out here it's everywhere
[20947.16s -> 20952.98s]  somebody has disturbed like anything unironically Diablo 2 Diablo 2 Bloodborne I love a lot of
[20952.98s -> 20956.18s]  things I just think it's boring to describe things you like you burger
[20957.45s -> 20961.85s]  yeah that's all right I'm not too into burgers anymore are you do you not let me ask you
[20961.85s -> 20965.29s]  something do you not like to talk about things you like because you don't want to seem like
[20966.65s -> 20970.49s]  like oh you don't want to like tell people how cool something is and then they don't like it
[20971.13s -> 20976.57s]  no I just legitimately think it's kind of boring and it's much more interesting to like analyze
[20976.57s -> 20981.45s]  things and like analyzing something you like is like no I like that it that's just that's all it
[20981.45s -> 20984.97s]  is that's like the whole conversation everyone's like oh you don't like any games all I ever hear
[20984.97s -> 20990.09s]  is you don't like this like slay the spire for me is like a 10 out of 10 brilliant game but I'm not
[20990.09s -> 20995.05s]  I don't like hey put the spear down put the spear down I get it why do I gotta put the spear down
[20995.05s -> 21005.50s]  use this you coming at me somebody said he wants rage clicks I'm getting them definitely
[21005.50s -> 21014.09s]  it's working for me no I think I can understand that in a way like okay I like this is like like
[21014.09s -> 21018.81s]  you like it right but then what more is there to say back in the day we could talk about like all
[21018.81s -> 21023.69s]  the weird shit within smite or I could go on for a long time about like overwatch is fucking weird
[21023.69s -> 21031.03s]  but like slay this bar it's just it's just a perfect great game just play it okay I mean I
[21031.03s -> 21037.21s]  played slay this bar good game right into this thing we can do this thing I'll do it oh my spear
[21038.57s -> 21044.41s]  um it was good I I kind of doing the math in my head kind of was hard and I was like
[21044.73s -> 21055.94s]  this is fun but it's not for me yeah math is like that I thought it was a good game though
[21055.94s -> 21059.99s]  it's definitely really cool you coming we're getting them let's go I think we're gonna try
[21059.99s -> 21081.53s]  to get them all right so we got a lot of explosives here a lot of explosives he jumped he's the
[21081.53s -> 21091.98s]  jumper I'm gonna throw an explosive I got him watch out kill him I throw that at you essentially
[21091.98s -> 21097.18s]  be careful oh we got a whole bunch of heads I don't know where they came from
[21098.38s -> 21101.98s]  but they're here hey
[21107.66s -> 21113.10s]  when it became like IGN game reviews were like that it's great and then like the reviews
[21115.02s -> 21125.98s]  this is no review yeah game was really fun we really liked it did that distract you
[21128.23s -> 21141.03s]  distract me trying to distract him oh all right he
[21142.71s -> 21159.22s]  I'm running around so much oh I posted them oh I'm gonna I'm about to throw a boomerang
[21159.22s -> 21166.87s]  all right talking about I'm out I'm out oh he did a bit of a jumpy
[21167.83s -> 21186.02s]  dad dad the only good said the dead said or old world wine bro played uh you played dark
[21186.02s -> 21192.79s]  messiah right I did yeah good game end of conversation all right but you you can
[21192.79s -> 21197.75s]  describe why something was good without just saying it was good I don't know if it's really
[21197.75s -> 21203.88s]  worth it because what if somebody's like well why do you say that okay what if somebody disagrees
[21203.88s -> 21209.16s]  with you that I don't think that game is good no no one disagrees with me like when when we
[21209.16s -> 21212.84s]  brought up like best games of all time Diablo 2 bloodborne like it's just not like we both just
[21212.84s -> 21217.48s]  agree it's very very obvious that we're both correct in this instance and same for dark messiah
[21217.48s -> 21222.98s]  well what if somebody said dark messiah that game sucks what would you say kind of a weird
[21222.98s -> 21227.22s]  opinion to just be like totally and completely wrong okay so they're gonna go why am I wrong
[21227.22s -> 21231.46s]  yes that's it's a bad game it's like stupid you fight orcs who cares like Peter Jackson did that
[21231.46s -> 21237.88s]  fucking hundred years ago I don't even know who Peter Jackson is like NATO do you like explain
[21237.88s -> 21243.05s]  why you like something we'll see that this this whole scenario like that doesn't bother me that
[21243.05s -> 21249.02s]  they don't like it you're like oh like oh what if I told you like I disagreed and I like don't like
[21249.02s -> 21258.39s]  like okay I'm upgrading my health someone comes up blood boy all that game fucking saw the souls
[21258.39s -> 21268.63s]  games the same all right I mean I could not wrong hmm interesting very interesting I think I want
[21268.63s -> 21278.46s]  to test this theory okay so if somebody told you that I don't like dark messiah and you are stupid
[21278.46s -> 21283.75s]  for liking it stupid like like you're you're an idiot like you like that game because you're dumb
[21285.13s -> 21291.77s]  now it becomes a personal attack do you defend yourself then no you don't I mean like that's
[21291.77s -> 21297.13s]  just such a fucking weird person where like the person is basing intelligence level of other
[21297.13s -> 21305.16s]  people on video game references and it's just a weirdo so you don't deny that you still like
[21305.16s -> 21311.48s]  surely I'm not I'm I am I could have a potential conversation about like oh yeah like I could tell
[21311.48s -> 21316.60s]  you why I like it but it's like I don't know it's not that's not an engaging conversation I'd rather
[21316.60s -> 21322.42s]  talk about something like engaging and divisive like Hillary's email like what's up with them
[21323.45s -> 21330.25s]  I don't know we're all just agreeing dark messiah is an amazing game
[21333.08s -> 21344.07s]  but yeah it is all right what do we need to turn in here that health upgrade was ass by the way
[21346.09s -> 21350.73s]  I oh I don't even know that I did it it's like plus one percent health it looks like I've just
[21350.73s -> 21359.90s]  been taking the stamina and even the stamina is not I guess I don't know I took this weird upgrade
[21359.90s -> 21363.98s]  and now if I press my sprint button I lose half of my stamina and I don't go any faster
[21364.94s -> 21372.36s]  oh that's right I got that too I'm not pressing sprint though did you get the the ledge launch
[21372.36s -> 21377.00s]  one that one's kind of ridiculous like he's forgetting to do it yeah me too you turn into
[21377.00s -> 21383.96s]  like spider-man you ever play prototype no actually I wanted to that's a really really
[21383.96s -> 21391.08s]  good game I tried to stream that game really yeah what happened the game ran like shit and
[21391.08s -> 21395.75s]  it was like all messed up the frame rate was fucked up everything on are you down
[21396.97s -> 21402.25s]  what did you play it on I think was pc who the fuck is this guy I don't want to be being chased
[21402.25s -> 21411.99s]  we gotta move I think they had it for sale on like playstation like a bundle of the old game
[21412.87s -> 21416.63s]  I tried to screen record it I tried to capture it but it was all messed up yeah people are saying
[21417.35s -> 21421.99s]  it doesn't work well on pc but there's a whole bunch of games I played in the last year I'm like
[21422.71s -> 21425.91s]  I'm not having fun this really feels like I should be playing prototype
[21427.03s -> 21435.91s]  I can see that I don't think I can make this jump
[21438.71s -> 21449.82s]  did you try I didn't realize there was an edge there almost just did it go off me get up get up
[21453.05s -> 21460.86s]  stir just maybe buy slay this bar on my phone good it's good get influenced maybe I should
[21460.86s -> 21464.78s]  tell people things I like more and then they buy them and then it didn't really matter
[21465.58s -> 21475.27s]  I want to lose place are you playing hearthstone still I saw you play it recently I tried when
[21475.27s -> 21483.86s]  they added like a new game mode thing to it not good I like watch people play battlegrounds on
[21483.86s -> 21488.66s]  the twitch tv if you've heard this twitch platform yeah I like playing and I'm I kind of really
[21488.66s -> 21494.34s]  don't care anymore and definitely not like standard I know I watch I watch I watch crypt too
[21495.22s -> 21500.09s]  I didn't say that's who you're talking about it's not who I was talking about
[21500.09s -> 21512.94s]  are you kidding me okay crip the poe streamer I'm shocked I'm shocked that you're not watching
[21512.94s -> 21517.58s]  preparing instead like for hearthstone I legitimately don't I mean like sometimes
[21517.58s -> 21522.62s]  but I don't stay up that late at night okay all right all right all right good good answer
[21522.62s -> 21529.34s]  you're safe I can't get in this fucking window I'm so pissed oh my god get in the window
[21532.62s -> 21549.40s]  why won't go in the window what's happening pretending right no I'm not pretending I can't
[21549.40s -> 21553.82s]  go in you can't get in the homie hole okay there you go oh we got a nighttime bonus
[21561.59s -> 21571.38s]  so exhausting pretending this much all right cool you made it I need to craft some stuff give me a
[21571.38s -> 21583.40s]  sec can you make these regeneration boosters that seems kind of I wonder what a small amount of
[21583.40s -> 21598.42s]  health is already maybe it's not worth doing already two percent per second hmm I'm gonna
[21598.42s -> 21610.26s]  go with what I know because I did upgrade these I could do one I'll get a few all tough yep
[21610.98s -> 21627.50s]  120 percent total how is that a small amount of health wait wait two percent okay this is a 60
[21627.50s -> 21634.44s]  second duration and it regens two percent health per second so it regens 120 percent of your health
[21635.00s -> 21645.35s]  how is that a small amount of health I don't know I didn't make it I didn't I don't know who who
[21645.35s -> 21657.08s]  are you I got a combat skill so kind of cool about that gets smaller over two percent is small
[21658.62s -> 21667.51s]  you know how percentages work it regens two percent of your health every second and it
[21667.51s -> 21686.34s]  lasts for 60 seconds am I how am I reading this wrong two percent gets smaller every time
[21687.70s -> 21691.46s]  oh because it's two percent of the current health that you're missing
[21699.75s -> 21702.95s]  yeah and two percent is this small you dunce you don't have to go be dunce
[21703.59s -> 21707.35s]  you can just say not I'm not talking yeah I'm not talking to you I did not I did not
[21708.15s -> 21715.38s]  all right you ready ready for what I got I got a bunch of mollusks super all over who won
[21716.02s -> 21742.33s]  we're going this way we're going this way 200 oh my god why what the cost of stamina from things
[21742.33s -> 21749.78s]  is really weird like exiting that pole ate all my stamina but holding on to the pole
[21749.78s -> 21758.06s]  probably gets better over time yeah I bet
[21762.84s -> 21768.30s]  so where are we heading now just to the marker I think we go in here and we tell the guys that
[21768.30s -> 21771.66s]  we're like cool and people are saying like these are the questions you want to do for these guys
[21771.66s -> 21780.46s]  and like we're doing them oh my god favorite hearthstone card favorite hearthstone card
[21784.39s -> 21793.58s]  for real no okay just passing the time I like like test gray main
[21798.50s -> 21803.77s]  somebody said I keep spacing out good you were right drink some water is a trap
[21803.77s -> 21808.49s]  and it looks like you were getting close to the truth eat a banana either they killed lucas
[21809.21s -> 21816.09s]  or they know who did will force so you'll take all right I'm gonna laugh if he was just dead in
[21816.09s -> 21823.91s]  your arms that does seem to happen at the end of those I think we got an item take over that
[21823.99s -> 21830.38s]  yeah we got like a hammer thanks thanks for killing that like hundred people you've killed
[21830.38s -> 21835.13s]  here's a hammer to do it some more scrapper is that what we just got this thing is terrible
[21835.77s -> 21842.22s]  yeah it was like a level one because we're still in the tutorial even though I this game's pacing is
[21842.22s -> 21852.36s]  bizarre are we just slow we're definitely slow yeah but we also definitely had to play for like
[21852.36s -> 21860.97s]  40 minutes to even start the stream that's true and we were not pausing for McDonald's orders
[21860.97s -> 21866.89s]  during that 45 to 50 minute I just I speed ran my heart out and it was still kind of like well
[21866.89s -> 21872.65s]  it wasn't slow it was fine it was a good intro but now it's like introing again that you're in the
[21872.65s -> 21879.18s]  city it's like going over the same stuff that's a little bit like you know like you know it kind
[21879.18s -> 21888.18s]  of grinds my gears you know you're gonna get your 60 dollars worth hey then looks like the bandits
[21888.18s -> 21895.14s]  fled the water tower who wants to take control and force the bizarre folk to talk you just started
[21895.14s -> 21901.38s]  running yeah you were just gone I thought you were following me honestly but watch out I was
[21901.38s -> 21906.02s]  kind of in my inventory I'm picking up all the lavender I'm getting some honey from these bees
[21906.02s -> 21910.18s]  I'm making I'm not even worried about getting stung bees are no problem for me I'm gonna pick
[21910.18s -> 21914.52s]  up uh these shrooms doing a little bit of live commentary right now I'm picking up gonna search
[21914.52s -> 21923.27s]  this guy the true question is which came first ranch or cool ranch ranch because then that
[21923.27s -> 21945.35s]  everything spun off of that we got a whole bunch of blues over here that I'm finding some blues
[21946.07s -> 21952.20s]  cool ranch always sounds like so odd to me I whenever I hear cool ranch for some reason I
[21952.20s -> 21960.14s]  think that it's got like free on in it I don't know what I'm doing he's just bouncing around
[21962.70s -> 21967.66s]  well you get like the the chain kick combo where you parry someone then you stun the next guy
[21968.95s -> 21992.09s]  but it's very awkward oh no bandits can I craft something new
[21996.01s -> 22002.31s]  um oh we're going this way come on we ever play the car dlc from dying light one
[22002.95s -> 22007.51s]  I don't think so we I tried to play some of it on my own but we did not play it
[22014.49s -> 22024.70s]  secret over there uh any secrets over here I really just can't I can't get over how good
[22024.70s -> 22034.39s]  this game looks and how I can't get over it I always turn all this shit off when I play these
[22034.39s -> 22041.32s]  games I go to the check boxes and I turn off bloom refractoring lighting shadows like I turn it all
[22041.32s -> 22046.44s]  off I'll see you got like a monster rig man what are those what are those specs tell me about your
[22046.44s -> 22051.16s]  monster fucking rig man all right I think crack my fingers here all right you want to hear
[22051.88s -> 22060.82s]  yeah let's get all right so my rig what happened we just explode what did you do
[22062.90s -> 22077.29s]  should we respond to the last story point yeah what happened I uh you see this giant pile of
[22077.29s -> 22088.04s]  explosives yeah I swung I swung on it oh what does it do what does it do he asked I wanted
[22088.04s -> 22093.77s]  to see the funny thing too on my screen I never actually hit it like the swing never finished I
[22093.77s -> 22101.21s]  was like oh do I gotta do this dude you gotta do this they're gonna blow it up that's like kind
[22101.21s -> 22106.17s]  of realistic though isn't it like we wouldn't see the explosion we just gone oh yeah I didn't like
[22106.17s -> 22120.50s]  the Sopranos ending don't talk about spoilers who hasn't seen the Sopranos that cares because if you
[22120.50s -> 22127.14s]  exploded like that it would just be like gone it wouldn't be like boom oh my explosion oh final
[22127.14s -> 22132.18s]  scene of Sopranos when he walks up to the fucking the propane tank and he punches it and it just
[22132.18s -> 22149.16s]  ends this is really weird hold on that was really funny
[22154.55s -> 22158.55s]  I just see Tony Soprano like at the end of the movie at the end of the show just being like it's
[22158.55s -> 22166.62s]  fucking stupid fuck you fuck this you fucking boom it's over credits fucking propane oh you
[22166.62s -> 22171.96s]  don't think I fuck what you think you're funny fucking propane I honestly if I'm in control of
[22171.96s -> 22178.12s]  any production or anything ever like that's how it's gonna end oh like that dumb my fucking head
[22178.12s -> 22186.89s]  how could you resist ending it with the person like punching a propane tank yeah like just like
[22187.93s -> 22198.86s]  sometimes shit happens oh okay not everything in life is like planned in a script room you know
[22198.86s -> 22218.17s]  sometimes I got something to fucking tell you oh fuck you oh come on it didn't happen
[22218.17s -> 22224.62s]  immediately yeah that's like the like you can see me do it but when you do it yourself it kind of
[22224.62s -> 22234.23s]  stops early it does all right all right all right all right all right stop it it says quest failed
[22234.23s -> 22243.88s]  on the credits oh we got to do this again you can't let that happen look at the fucking slime
[22243.88s -> 22248.36s]  guy he's been in the fucking line he's fucking got a fuck I gotta shoot fucking snot out of his fucking
[22248.36s -> 22255.29s]  mouth where's the rest of it where's the rest oh I think it's more find and disarm the explosives
[22255.29s -> 22265.29s]  oh yeah there's a whole like there's a whole secret route up here any secrets over here oh yeah
[22265.29s -> 22273.45s]  there's secrets up here I just keep thinking of like Tony Soprano's got like a gun in his hand
[22274.41s -> 22279.45s]  it's like three or four other characters and they're all just arguing now that you think that
[22279.45s -> 22289.14s]  that's funny mm-hmm that's Sabrina clip is that for me that's all right I get it because there's
[22289.14s -> 22293.86s]  so much build up and there's so there's no reason for her to just suddenly get shot by a crossbow
[22293.86s -> 22301.00s]  in the show to end so like in that my head cannon shows over there where's this other bomb I think
[22301.00s -> 22304.92s]  we gotta there's some we gotta climb up here we're gonna go in here and bombs in here don't swing on
[22304.92s -> 22316.15s]  these don't swing on we're gonna have to climb again I'm not I'm not swinging get it yeah there's
[22316.15s -> 22327.83s]  more we need to go we need to do uppies I think from here yeah inside what is this place why does
[22327.83s -> 22333.99s]  anyone care if it explodes I don't know it's an important building of some kind the water tower
[22333.99s -> 22343.82s]  maybe where did you go how did you get up there inside the building they're in this room arguing
[22343.90s -> 22360.65s]  Tony Sopranos in here jack shut the fuck up you fucking idiot someone's gonna punch it all right
[22360.65s -> 22368.98s]  I got it oh yeah it was a water tower I don't know why everyone's like worried about water most
[22368.98s -> 22376.25s]  abundant resource and they're like oh I'm to the top of the water tower I'm doing yeah we're doing
[22376.25s -> 22401.67s]  some climbing I think I think you're right what the hell is that that just reminded me of do you
[22401.67s -> 22407.35s]  want to go in that cage do you remember mr. show mr. who mr. show is this it was a show on HBO it

[22417.74s -> 22422.14s]  Cross it's that kind of it was a sketch comedy show and you want to talk about one of the funniest
[22422.14s -> 22429.50s]  things that you've seen which is a Sabrina thing they did this bit where it was like the Sopranos
[22429.50s -> 22434.54s]  but all of the violence and swears were edited out of the show because it was for like network tv
[22434.54s -> 22441.66s]  it was like and for the first time we're airing like the the Soprano family on uh abc
[22442.54s -> 22447.66s]  and dude it was the funniest fucking goddamn thing like every two seconds it's just like shut

[22869.48s -> 22875.02s]  he was already dead man it really was so stupid though back when movies would air on tv on
[22875.02s -> 22880.78s]  network tv when you know netflix hb all this nobody that doesn't exist it was they would put
[22880.78s -> 22886.22s]  the stupidest shit in the play in place of swears they would really do this oh yeah I forgot they
[22886.22s -> 22891.18s]  actually would like change the words rather than believe it's control of the water and it would be
[22891.18s -> 22900.02s]  the actor would do it forgot yeah they were man how did I like miss the whole joke that's true
[22900.02s -> 22904.10s]  it'd be like you are out of your flooping mind the stuff that nobody would ever say
[22905.66s -> 22913.53s]  they would really do that it made no sense oh we get like a choice you seeing this yeah there's
[22913.53s -> 22921.11s]  either car traps or ziplines I want ziplines like who cares about a car trap yeah we ziplines for
[22921.11s -> 22940.57s]  sure I just want to go I'm voting zipline yeah I vote it we did it peacekeeper bow is the best
[22940.57s -> 22946.63s]  weapon in the whole game yeah so how did how did we go from like needing to find our girlfriend to
[22947.11s -> 22952.02s]  saving villages I don't know maybe that always happened maybe we should play the game and find
[22952.02s -> 22958.22s]  up okay you should uh not skip every single dialogue piece I mean I can't skip this for
[22958.22s -> 22962.86s]  some reason I've had it with these monkey fighting snakes on this monday to friday plane
[22963.58s -> 22979.32s]  yeah that's the class that's a classic one okay city alignment we're playing planet side yeah okay
[22979.32s -> 22993.46s]  city alignment tool yeah my city is aligning all right oh there's like a whole other area
[22993.46s -> 22997.78s]  you know there's like a whole other area in this game yeah we've been we've been hitting on darn
[22997.78s -> 23003.77s]  asses for the last six hours and six and a half hours dude there's like a whole downtown there's
[23003.77s -> 23014.55s]  the wharf very cool hey then where the fuck are you barney you trying to capture him jack and joe
[23014.55s -> 23021.61s]  warned him he could have avoided the trap but he went into it anyway that's when maybe we should
[23021.61s -> 23028.09s]  are you doing all right I'll make sure the place is safe are you are you worried about me
[23028.09s -> 23035.10s]  uh you want to but like half an hour 30 minutes uh yeah now that we unlocked the new area I think
[23035.10s -> 23039.22s]  that's about it for me I mean we've been playing for almost six and a half hours
[23039.94s -> 23043.94s]  you know I would be good honestly though you good I don't know if you want to play again or what but
[23043.94s -> 23049.94s]  okay it just seems like a funny spot to end but you're like yeah we've been playing like all day
[23049.94s -> 23059.72s]  yeah I wouldn't mind okay have you gone to a thousand points now uh I feel like I would have
[23059.72s -> 23065.48s]  to see the new area I'm at like 950 I feel like okay I don't I don't feel like the game has too
[23065.48s -> 23070.04s]  many surprises left will you start getting grappling hooks and your wing-a-dings and maybe
[23070.04s -> 23076.97s]  yep I think it's like it's like most games these days it's front-loaded with so much
[23076.97s -> 23080.65s]  bullshit even if the rest of it is fun and it's hard to recommend to anyone you're like oh yeah
[23081.37s -> 23086.09s]  if you watch like the first season like season two is pretty good skip three yeah and then like like
[23086.09s -> 23094.89s]  four is all right yeah that does tend to happen nowadays yeah I think it's good I felt that way
[23094.89s -> 23100.18s]  about dying light one though too that if if you just had all your stuff unlocked and it really
[23100.18s -> 23107.03s]  was like sandbox world the game probably would have been a lot more fun I could see that I will
[23107.03s -> 23118.65s]  say I give it a I give it like a 9.8 be like a 9.8 and a half that's very high does your scale
[23118.65s -> 23121.85s]  will go up to like 20 or I was just waiting for you to be like you're a fucking idiot so then I
[23121.85s -> 23126.49s]  could prove to you that I could prove to you the point you made earlier that like no because I
[23126.49s -> 23131.21s]  know that you're joking yeah I was waiting for you to call me dumb is this really okay like
[23131.21s -> 23138.49s]  bloodborne's a 10 this is a 9.8 no this is a solid this is a solid game I'm doing a jump joke are
[23138.49s -> 23156.12s]  you let me see other players are waiting for you where are you oh you're here all right yeah maybe
[23156.12s -> 23161.45s]  I mean if you want to play it again we could obviously play again if you wanted to how do you
[23161.45s -> 23170.20s]  feel how are you what's your schedule like stir oh my schedule is uh panic panic stress uh saturday
[23170.20s -> 23176.84s]  myriad wipe my wipe my brow uh which by the way right panic panic that's in the middle of it
[23176.84s -> 23182.68s]  episode four just happened right yeah yeah what is the what is the myriad by the way
[23182.68s -> 23189.48s]  curious oh I mean the myriad is uh basically like a dnd campaign that I run every week on my
[23189.48s -> 23193.56s]  channel on saturdays we've got a couple of fun uh gamer streamers and in the future germa is
[23193.56s -> 23197.08s]  going to be a part of it uh because it's a whole system I programmed and you don't you you can
[23197.08s -> 23202.20s]  have streamer brain rot and play it because it's all automated and I am I am the dungeon
[23202.68s -> 23211.18s]  production man of the show right and where can we find you on twitch.tv slash stir anywhere
[23211.18s -> 23219.30s]  any more that's s t e r I feel like I'm I'm killing this yes s t e r yeah it's dnd without
[23219.30s -> 23227.34s]  the dnd that it's dnd without like all the stuff that makes dnd slow yeah yeah pretty cool I think
[23227.34s -> 23231.66s]  it's a really cool thing all right you can just wait till germa plays it because one day he's
[23231.66s -> 23239.16s]  gonna play it one day yeah whenever we decide to do that uh but yeah indeed uh if you if you

[23372.18s -> 23381.03s]  game master see he proved it right there game master has disconnected you and you're gonna
[23381.03s -> 23391.93s]  return to your game uh a couple things I do want to talk about real quick today is the last day
[23393.43s -> 23401.06s]  for you to nominate people for the streamer awards it ends I believe tonight at midnight so
[23401.06s -> 23408.39s]  if you had I was gonna take it on stream but I looked at the list and I realized that I don't
[23408.39s -> 23414.23s]  think I would reliably be able to answer too many of these just because I don't really watch a ton
[23414.23s -> 23428.81s]  of like some of the content that's here yeah I'll link it hold on it is alone it is the streamer
[23428.81s -> 23439.74s]  awards.com here it is there are a shitload of categories you guys know uh cutie cinderella
[23439.74s -> 23447.64s]  and maya they are running this there's a ton of people involved um it seems like a pretty cool
[23447.64s -> 23456.55s]  idea it's sort of like a twitch awards show uh if I could give you the ones I've if you want
[23456.55s -> 23461.16s]  me to do some nominations here I could probably give you some if I'm scrolling down the list but
[23461.16s -> 23465.40s]  like stuff like league streamer roleplay streamer battle royale streamer I don't really watch too
[23465.40s -> 23477.26s]  much of that uh so I don't really know but let's see here I'll give you some some examples the
[23478.06s -> 23493.83s]  did it no it didn't did it it should be until midnight right it's ended it didn't it did it
[23493.83s -> 23504.90s]  did it oh shit did I miss it I don't know it doesn't I can I can see it still you don't have
[23504.90s -> 23514.52s]  to enter a name for each yeah you can you can skip categories it says February 13th they end yeah
[23514.52s -> 23523.27s]  tonight it yeah today tonight at midnight that's what I said but yeah let me go through some of
[23523.27s -> 23527.91s]  these real quick I'll give you some of my opinions I mean uh I'll start with I guess vtuber streamer
[23527.91s -> 23540.82s]  that's that's I'm gonna say neanderth I don't really know that many other vtuber streamers if
[23540.82s -> 23550.07s]  I would keep going uh uh best like smash brothers I don't really know sports game I don't really know
[23550.07s -> 23556.41s]  I don't really know who else best okay best variety streamer I would say lidwig
[23556.41s -> 23566.94s]  lidwig absolutely is best variety streamer of the year without a doubt best streamed event I would
[23566.94s -> 23576.31s]  say you know you know whatever whatever I don't know you know there's things that happened this
[23576.31s -> 23587.69s]  year or it's supposed to be 2021 so stream game of the year is what would be a stream game of the
[23587.69s -> 23602.98s]  year stream game of the year because this is all across all of shit you can't hold on this across
[23602.98s -> 23611.91s]  all the platforms right because it's not just like oh a game that I played on my channel it's
[23611.91s -> 23619.45s]  like just across all of twitch all of youtube everywhere I mean I among us I would probably
[23619.45s -> 23624.41s]  say I mean that's like one of the biggest things that happened last year right I mean I didn't play
[23624.41s -> 23634.58s]  it I don't know it's my vote yeah it is it is I don't know I would probably say among us even
[23634.58s -> 23641.96s]  though I don't even like play it best content organization esports or content organization
[23641.96s -> 23649.11s]  that has created the best content during the past year but I think I probably put the production
[23649.11s -> 23657.22s]  company that I've worked with every time community jakes company what I was gonna put
[23660.66s -> 23666.17s]  is that I don't know if that's like an esport like content organization that has created the
[23666.17s -> 23674.15s]  best content if that fits I mean I don't know if it does but that's jk productions I don't know if
[23674.15s -> 23688.15s]  that's accurate but uh if I keep going I don't know I can't some of these it's hard like rising
[23688.15s -> 23697.70s]  star award for instance I'd like who's like somebody that I didn't really notice before but
[23697.70s -> 23714.44s]  they're like really kind of blown up um it's hard to put somebody here because are we talking brand
[23714.44s -> 23718.68s]  up-and-coming streamer that's had tremendous growth over the past year and has the potential
[23718.68s -> 23727.11s]  to be a top streamer I mean I I would say I mean Connor's been pretty popular for a while though
[23729.18s -> 23735.42s]  maybe like atriarch but he's been popular too for a while how popular are they gonna be
[23738.70s -> 23756.94s]  is popular is popular like five to ten like I don't know I'm not sure because all the people
[23756.94s -> 23761.58s]  that I would put in this list are already pretty popular like they already have like a large
[23761.58s -> 23771.80s]  following I don't know I don't know who would put their legacy award a legend who's contributed
[23771.80s -> 23778.01s]  a great deal and has shaped the industry career achievement award I don't know I don't know who
[23778.01s -> 23789.43s]  would even say for them gamer of the year I gotta give that to xqc are you serious streamer that
[23789.43s -> 23797.18s]  has extraordinary gaming abilities and as excelled at games over the past year and then streamer of
[23797.18s -> 23809.42s]  the year streamer of the year I mean I think you gotta I think I have to nominate Ludwig for this
[23810.74s -> 23817.14s]  I think Ludwig did a ton of shit he did so many things he I think he's probably one of the
[23817.86s -> 23826.30s]  few people that is doing interesting content on every platform yeah but I'm not gonna vote
[23826.30s -> 23830.78s]  for myself I don't I'm not gonna go into the presidential booth and be like that's right
[23830.78s -> 23837.72s]  that's me oh I'm giving you my opinions right this is not just for twitch this is for everywhere
[23838.44s -> 23849.14s]  this is youtube this is twitch this is facebook I don't know residents do do that though yeah but
[23849.14s -> 23860.98s]  if I'm if I'm not talking about like being an ego Andy I would say probably Ludwig that's what
[23860.98s -> 23876.76s]  I would say he's done a lot of stuff yeah he's also done a lot of stuff for this channel I mean
[23877.88s -> 23885.13s]  a lot of things uh I got a lot of help from him over the last year or two for tons of different
[23885.13s -> 23897.24s]  things so he's a he he's a really really great dude and I really do genuinely think that like
[23897.32s -> 23903.80s]  he does interesting stuff either that or I'm gonna put xqc like I'm just gonna put xqc here
[23903.80s -> 23913.86s]  if it's not Ludwig that's what I'm gonna do also like league of their own the streamer is a pioneer
[23913.86s -> 23917.14s]  that creates one-of-a-kind content with their creativity out of the box thinking they're a
[23917.14s -> 23921.06s]  trailblazer in the streaming industry someone who relies on themselves for their content and
[23921.06s -> 23929.14s]  genuinely is in a league of their own I mean I would probably put xqc here too like xqc just
[23929.14s -> 23933.78s]  does his own shit he doesn't like rely on anything or anybody else he kind of just does his thing he's
[23933.78s -> 23940.17s]  in his own lane yeah but I'm not we're not talking about me right now we're not talking
[23940.17s -> 23948.76s]  about me you can vote for whoever you want and that's cool all right okay you can vote
[23948.76s -> 23955.42s]  wherever you want but I'm just okay I'm taking myself out of the equation I can't what am I
[23955.42s -> 23961.10s]  gonna be here be like oh let me tell you how I think about me I belong here I belong here I
[23961.10s -> 23976.01s]  belong here I belong here yeah best valorant streamer that's me baby yep uh yeah I think I
[23976.01s -> 23985.14s]  think that's accurate I'm gonna say Ludwig I think that's accurate all the others it's hard
[23985.14s -> 23995.72s]  for me to do because I don't watch too many streamers we're the oldest juicer couple oh god
[24007.61s -> 24023.40s]  oh no all right I'll see you guys on Wednesday take care of yourselves let me try to give 100
