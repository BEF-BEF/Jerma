[1.40s -> 14.07s]  All right. So, what? Uh, HillScent, thanks for the five community subs. Hill. Uh, what's- what do you- uh, what do you-
[14.07s -> 26.33s]  Eh, what do you guys want to do? I don't know if I want to do Jump King. I think I'm- might be too
[26.33s -> 47.22s]  wound up for that. Put in the two towers. Two towers! Let's go! Two towers! Let's go! Let's go! Two towers!
[47.86s -> 51.19s]  Oh shit!
[60.31s -> 78.33s]  Damn it. I like just fucked up my Xbox controller. Everything's full. What? Oh, it's all right.
[80.04s -> 88.71s]  It's good. It's okay. Okay. So, uh, did you hear that oh shit, by the way?
[91.26s -> 103.46s]  That was so weak. I was like, oh shit! Real voice. Two towers. You guys ready?
[104.97s -> 108.01s]  You said it and now we're going. I've- this is- this one is fucking awesome.
[112.33s -> 125.42s]  I guarantee you, he's gonna like the first part of this game. Are we finally gonna watch Lord of
[125.42s -> 151.38s]  the Rings naked? Uh, no. We're not gonna watch Lord of the Rings naked. All right, let's get this on.
[151.38s -> 166.14s]  How does it look? Here we go! I gotta change the, uh, I gotta change this. This game is actually very-
[166.22s -> 174.58s]  God damn it. This game's actually very, very good. It's actually fantastic. Do not let the last game
[174.58s -> 188.23s]  sour you on this one because this one is actually fucking incredible. All right. All right. I gotta
[188.23s -> 205.96s]  get it. I gotta get there. The world has changed. Feel it in the water. Feel it in the earth. No,
[205.96s -> 208.92s]  this game is actually fucking one of the best games to come out on PlayStation 2.
[209.88s -> 214.04s]  It just- it's- it's got like the red banner at the top. It says classic PlayStation 2 game.
[224.97s -> 236.12s]  Yeah, I don't know. It actually is true. It began with the forging of the great rings.
[237.24s -> 241.16s]  Okay, this is just the beginning. Am I allowed to watch this?
[245.22s -> 249.38s]  I'm gonna get in trouble. This is the beginning of the movie.
[254.42s -> 259.78s]  Get your popcorn, guys. We're watching the movie. Who above all else desire power.
[260.74s -> 266.14s]  For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.
[267.18s -> 276.66s]  But they were all of them deceived. For another ring was made. Yeah. In the land of Mordor,
[276.66s -> 284.82s]  in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring to control all
[284.82s -> 292.58s]  others. And into this ring, he poured his cruelty, his malice, and his will to dominate all life.
[295.75s -> 300.07s]  What is this nerd bullshit? What are you talking about? This is the greatest PlayStation 2 game.
[300.71s -> 307.37s]  Red banner. The free lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the ring. But there were some
[308.09s -> 315.00s]  who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor.
[315.00s -> 320.52s]  And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought. Nerd bullshit. All right. All right. We I really
[320.52s -> 339.00s]  probably shouldn't do something. Literally just the movie. There's gonna be an algorithm
[339.00s -> 350.33s]  is going to find this screen and I'm going to get fucking my screen. Let's go.
[356.97s -> 363.82s]  This fuck is Harry.
[376.33s -> 379.85s]  I hate that shit, by the way. Anytime a video game pulls you out,
[380.73s -> 399.54s]  there's a huge, it's epic battle. You square to block. Like, no, don't just. Oh, wait. What do I
[399.54s -> 411.58s]  do? I wasn't looking. I wasn't looking. Shield attack. Look at this epic battle.
[412.62s -> 431.22s]  This combos in this game and shit. You want to listen RPG. There's RPG elements in this game. I
[431.22s -> 452.58s]  can't wait. I'm excited. Is there a dodge roll in this game? If that completes the four buttons,
[452.58s -> 484.18s]  if there is. Let's go. R2 when they're on the ground. Yep. Oh, that was pretty sick. Good,
[484.18s -> 500.28s]  good, good, good, good. Did somebody just say your movie sucks? I didn't make this movie. Hey, dude,
[500.28s -> 525.51s]  I just like came to stream model. You know, your movie sucks. Oh, we go. This is the best part.
[528.97s -> 547.59s]  It was in this moment. We get the movie again when all hope had faded.
[548.31s -> 557.64s]  Wait, wait, that was just that was just the piece PS2 one. I wish it was the PS2 render.
[557.64s -> 584.36s]  That would have been so much better. The enemy of the free peoples of middle earth was defeated.
[585.40s -> 594.33s]  The ring passed to Isildur who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. He didn't do it.
[594.33s -> 597.45s]  But the hearts of men are easily corrupted.
[610.63s -> 614.39s]  Oh, this is great. This is when actors get into the room in the audio booth
[614.95s -> 617.75s]  and they have glasses down on their nose at eight o'clock in the morning
[620.68s -> 628.81s]  and read every line like this. I am Isildur's era to me. Let's go. Next page.
[628.81s -> 648.52s]  It is read. All right, let's go. Good. Mission experience 711. Save the game. Game one, game
[648.52s -> 657.18s]  10, game two, one, game one. This game is crusty. It's very good, though. It's very, very, very good.
[657.90s -> 666.65s]  Harry in order to block enemy attacks with black arrows. It's a classic game.
[666.65s -> 685.26s]  Visengard is empty. It is an army bred for one purpose, to destroy the world of men.
[686.22s -> 708.02s]  Ring. Oh, oh. Boss fight. They seek the ring bearer. Stay close.
[711.98s -> 735.91s]  Wait, where's Broto? Can I lock on? How do I put fire on here? All right, I got it. I got it. How
[735.91s -> 745.50s]  do I swing with the other hand? Light it up. Fire. How do I swing the other hand? All right,
[745.50s -> 759.94s]  it's on. It's on fire now. There is definitely a lock on. It has to be. I know there is. Is there
[759.94s -> 775.74s]  not all right i gotta stand next to the fire come on here we go oh god i'm gonna die fucking
[775.74s -> 811.50s]  please do something the ps2 fucking sucks laughing my ass off it does not with one hp
[812.94s -> 831.93s]  whatever keep away from them proto god damn it i tried to block my dad there's no i remember
[831.93s -> 843.66s]  they've been a lock on somebody came and said how are you still playing this it's a different
[843.66s -> 846.94s]  game this is not the same game i probably shouldn't have done this because everyone's
[846.94s -> 851.26s]  been there that left is gonna come back and be like fuck this game dude what are you nuts
[851.82s -> 901.83s]  what happened i think it crashed come on give me one second it's all right it's because i
[901.83s -> 928.15s]  tried to skip it really quickly i fucked it up somehow i have blue ass screen laundry machine
[933.16s -> 944.58s]  that was kind of a laundry machine you're right yeah yeah yeah 2002 this came out one year after
[944.58s -> 953.16s]  the last one yeah games uh-huh this game i this game really is so good i just have to be good at
[953.16s -> 979.50s]  it it's hard 20 years ago almost yeah watch the movie again no thankfully i did save it all right
[979.50s -> 992.74s]  let's not get killed by the cutscene that would be nice return of the king is even better and they
[992.74s -> 1006.94s]  did they did to get better as we went along all right here we go bison guard is empty
[1007.90s -> 1016.12s]  wait one army bred for one purpose to destroy the world of men hold on no no no i was gonna
[1016.12s -> 1028.22s]  say no it didn't go to the very beginning did it okay we're good all right let's do it
[1028.94s -> 1034.94s]  game's fucking hard i got a parry and then light they seek the ring bearer stay close

[1121.88s -> 1123.24s]  i wasn't looking at the fucking screen
[1126.04s -> 1136.02s]  oh i have a special move i don't think a special move doesn't matter
[1136.02s -> 1147.40s]  i can't even hurt them with this only fire oh yeah if you fill that meter you get the super moves
[1147.40s -> 1164.18s]  now i remember ow somebody said harry potter what do you mean harry potter this is the lord
[1164.18s -> 1184.57s]  of the ring all right we're good tutorial done somebody from twitch is gonna skip through this
[1184.97s -> 1188.73s]  and see this and they're gonna go what the fuck was he doing in the sanctuary is he stupid

[2757.22s -> 2763.62s]  the quest stands upon the edge of a knife straight but a little and it will fail but it
[2763.62s -> 2768.50s]  would become darker still for a fellowship was failing i would have gone with you to the end
[2768.50s -> 2784.06s]  and into the very fires for who carries the fate of us all we protect proto let me try to get some

[4153.72s -> 4160.12s]  that was but the trail ends here that was so cool split up to find them quickly 20 years ago it
[4160.12s -> 4176.97s]  really was let's split up what i get i got a new combo right that looked pretty good

[4233.94s -> 4244.23s]  around me sorry i didn't practice my playstation 2 action game skills before the stream started
[4256.18s -> 4270.79s]  wait what do you what do you drop this is another tree boss is this a tree boss i think it might be
[4271.67s -> 4297.13s]  oh great this shit troll he's dead i wouldn't have that actually that's pretty easy
[4297.85s -> 4319.19s]  what am i i'm not gandalf you don't in this game oh that's only in the turn of the game
[4320.79s -> 4363.82s]  behind behind behind behind they can't kick me in the hole can i give me that meter meter got it

[4478.42s -> 4504.57s]  it just got released open source i always imagine that's probably so what does that
[4504.57s -> 4509.13s]  so people can now just essentially have the entire game's code to be able to make their own
[4509.13s -> 4513.53s]  levels or what's the benefit of doing that what do you make you can only make like a sequel or
[4513.53s -> 4519.18s]  something make your own levels make your own game essentially in the game it's on github that's
[4519.18s -> 4538.14s]  crazy i wonder what the legality of that stuff really is i guess if you self-publish right what's
[4538.14s -> 4556.74s]  going on why can't i move i was i was just like stuck that's weird okay that's just that's my
[4556.74s -> 4579.30s]  that's my mirror i thought that was an enemy really starting to overuse this and i know you're

[12242.68s -> 12269.18s]  people who knows if it's the guy behind you the guy in front of you that died doesn't really help
[12281.50s -> 12330.26s]  you're gonna stop me in the middle lat how dare you i'm so over it i'm so over it i'm so over it
[12343.45s -> 12350.36s]  why am i reloading the game well because uh the last helms deep level heads is deemed to be

[13281.77s -> 13302.46s]  what's a level that i can reliably oh push the ladders baby ignore combat 100 completely don't
[13302.46s -> 13310.31s]  hit anyone do not hit anyone just only do ladders but i i'm gonna get overrun you're swinging at
[13310.31s -> 13315.43s]  air i but it's hard it's the game the game's controls are hard kick the ladders only in the
[13315.43s -> 13329.69s]  middle that's not gonna work i'll try it kick ladders only in the middle stay in the middle
[13330.49s -> 13341.34s]  okay are you okay i'm gonna i'm only gonna kick the ladders in the middle
[13342.70s -> 13351.22s]  that is the worst idea ever kick all ladders i don't want to hear this
[13354.26s -> 13356.50s]  i don't want to hear that anymore i'm sick of hearing it
[13378.02s -> 13388.02s]  okay i'm only gonna knock down the middle ladders and i have time though that's this
[13388.02s -> 13418.39s]  this is not a good idea stick to the plan stick to the plan stick to the plan what was the plan
[13418.95s -> 13427.38s]  what was the plan only ladders in the middle after what was the plan only throw axes no ladders
[13427.38s -> 13449.16s]  for x what do you mean where am i throwing the axes at am i doing it right the plan sick of the plan
[13449.16s -> 13454.44s]  take the plan axe move what no no the axe move takes like five seconds to charge up it's not
[13454.44s -> 13475.66s]  gonna work you take 10 seconds to kill a guy and mail it i think you severely underestimate how
[13475.66s -> 13480.62s]  hard it is to play this game i think you under like i said you can sit there and go wow he's
[13480.62s -> 13486.54s]  fucking stupid what a dumb motherfucker i hope he shits his pants swinging this axe is hard
[13516.15s -> 13528.92s]  i'm not ignoring the left i have time to do one okay now i'm gonna ignore it
[13555.51s -> 13573.72s]  finish the fucking job mate now we're going come on you're supposed to be the best player
[13595.05s -> 13599.77s]  get over there get over they made it in they made it in they made it in this guy who didn't

[13645.59s -> 13673.66s]  and over again what do you mean ignore entire left side it actually seems like it's working out
[13675.46s -> 13685.13s]  imagine ignoring the entire left side and that's what you had to do imagine there's there's so many
[13685.13s -> 13692.89s]  ladders why don't we uh here's an idea guys why don't you dump gasoline where they're putting
[13692.89s -> 13700.50s]  the ladders down and drop a match um why not you just start dropping the anvils over the edge
[13701.83s -> 13726.39s]  go wire up a few pianos and drop them over the edge okay here we go here we go
[13732.87s -> 13739.78s]  just sit there and drop anvil just have a guy being a huh huh guys
[13748.87s -> 13755.21s]  um

[13817.32s -> 13820.92s]  doing basically the same thing you're doing by focusing the ladders they don't get swarmed
[13820.92s -> 13826.36s]  nearly as much as you so i i have as you have so i hate to say that i think you're just getting
[13826.36s -> 13838.34s]  unlucky no i'm not getting unlucky all right only ladders okay every time i swing the axe i give
[13838.34s -> 13871.42s]  10 community subs he's faking his own hype train move out of the fucking way that was a good start
[13871.42s -> 13904.15s]  too but it was ruined by the standing people they were trying to get in my way it's like they're
[13904.15s -> 13941.06s]  trying to get in my way it's yeah we're playing football now get out of my way get out of my way

[14223.29s -> 14240.50s]  here we go it's gonna instantly turn red i'm trying to push the ladder you fucking dick
[14241.62s -> 14250.92s]  just push it down man i got stun locked i got stun locked i am about to oh my god i got
[14250.92s -> 14262.98s]  stun locked by this fucking motherfucker right next to me oh my god it's this is the worst
[14264.10s -> 14270.98s]  look at how many people are up here there's no way i'm gonna be doing this there's no way i can't
[14270.98s -> 14299.18s]  even do that is anybody gonna kill somebody up here so it came back and i got stun locked by the
[14299.18s -> 14308.86s]  way is is there in the most celebrated franchise in human history is there a reason why catapults
[14308.86s -> 14340.47s]  launch and then the bar fills to red in eight seconds how did actual gimli do this this is
[14340.47s -> 14346.87s]  based on history god i wonder how did how did they do this back thousand years ago
[14350.82s -> 14357.54s]  guys i don't know i'm supposed to stick to the plan but let's be completely honest i'm not sure
[14357.54s -> 14371.77s]  that plans i'm not sure it's a sound plan anymore that's the furthest we've made it we make it to
[14371.77s -> 14379.10s]  there every time and then everybody just there's a thousand people on the screen try the left instead
[14379.10s -> 14396.01s]  where is the horse should have just built up aerodrome i shouldn't have to do that
[14399.83s -> 14446.50s]  i'm just here for the free sub well what is it at 30 this area okay this area needed
[14446.50s -> 14453.46s]  this area needs is is over tweaked it needs to be under tweaked there is this is this is over tweaked
[14453.46s -> 14467.74s]  it needs to be under tweaked how is the right left side been doing that poorly i have enough
[14467.74s -> 14490.50s]  time to get left at least the first one that's in one why it's like every time there's a cut
[14490.50s -> 14497.99s]  scene the game continues to load the enemies that's what's happening whenever we whenever we see a
[14497.99s -> 14513.13s]  cut scene it's still loading ladders and people in here but the ladders don't matter it's the
[14513.13s -> 14519.61s]  amount of orcs on the wall yeah but if there's ladders up i can't kill them uh you get a
[14519.69s -> 14525.61s]  completely overrun what's supposed to happen is player a runs around and hits ladders and stays
[14525.61s -> 14531.05s]  on the left side and player b runs around on the right side and hits ladders and kills enemies on
[14531.05s -> 14546.20s]  the right side my player b is standing over here swinging at the same two orcs i don't even have
[14546.20s -> 14568.98s]  another controller to plug in i fucked it up i fucked it up no sorry salvageable that spawn
[14568.98s -> 14595.35s]  right next to me on the right salvaged everything right at the middle left side right side here it
[14595.35s -> 14606.78s]  comes ready one two one two one two one two come on oh my god it's just a game it's just a football
[14606.78s -> 14611.66s]  game it really is they just they just it's three or four of them on the screen at the same time
[14612.22s -> 14624.20s]  and they take up almost all of the real estate on screen the left side if you have time i'm not
[14624.20s -> 14634.38s]  sure i ever will first time i've fallen because that guy backed up look see he's doing a great
[14634.38s -> 14662.94s]  job walking around maybe collapsed on he's toxic to teammates well tell them to push a ladder down
[14665.38s -> 14673.48s]  even if they did it once if one of these ai pushed one ladder to the ground one
[14674.28s -> 14688.46s]  i'd probably be why is this this there's so many people up here right now but i'm not i don't
[14688.46s -> 14696.86s]  understand why only two ladders are up fuck that's that doesn't count that was a recovery
[14707.48s -> 14714.65s]  god damn it i just got so screwed the less the left side i can't as the left side of all
[14714.65s -> 14735.56s]  is left side done as the left the left side might be fucking toast push the ladder oh my god
[14736.84s -> 14742.36s]  block that's block that was a block you guys i think seriously seriously there's so many
[14742.36s -> 14749.10s]  people on the screen that you can't even walk to the ladder these are blocks these are blocks
[14749.90s -> 14774.09s]  i'm gonna watch is there a speedrun of this anyone played this fucking game
[14774.09s -> 14781.51s]  to a to a point where they want to speed run this painful shit two towers helms deep speed run
[14782.71s -> 14792.23s]  how the fuck does anyone reliably do this um let's see i want to see this skip to helms deep
[14792.79s -> 14815.66s]  what the hell do they even do it's okay if it's too hard jermal i just want to see i guarantee you
[14816.38s -> 14821.66s]  who wants to make some bets here i'll make a bet with you this is a speed run of this game
[14821.66s -> 14828.06s]  in 47 minutes i guarantee you i will gift another 10 subs if during this this guy doesn't go
[14828.78s -> 14869.26s]  stupid fucking part of the game you ready no i this is all wrong oh that's why it's doing that
[14869.26s -> 14872.12s]  okay all right makes sense okay
[14906.79s -> 14908.23s]  there are enough for us both ghibli
[14911.27s -> 14918.86s]  right look at it right now he's going the fuck out of the way he's there's no mic
[14920.14s -> 14946.26s]  he goes left too guys he goes left he doesn't he goes left he has not swung the sword once
[14946.90s -> 14972.23s]  so far he just i feel like i'm doing this faster than this doing it in order
[14973.75s -> 14985.05s]  wait in order of what do you mean in order is he fasting is is he faster running animation don't
[14985.05s -> 14996.71s]  even tell me that's what it is no it's not wait ghibli has a slower running it's ghibli is actually
[14996.71s -> 15023.16s]  a slower character no no way i don't believe that for a second 100 you ignore the left two
[15023.16s -> 15034.70s]  ladders i feel like i'm doing i'm doing it the same way i'm doing it the same way no he's not
[15034.70s -> 15047.21s]  ignoring the other ladder this is like the world record holder he's taking out the two left but
[15047.21s -> 15066.98s]  that's legolas no it's not legolas doesn't have a two-handed sword he's doing it in a pre-determined
[15066.98s -> 15074.84s]  order so should i just be doing it as they pop up all right so let's see the right just popped
[15074.84s -> 15084.54s]  up right there does he run all the way across to the right side he does he's doing them in the order
[15084.54s -> 15091.98s]  that they're popping up is it yeah he he's skipped that other one that all right no see what he did
[15091.98s -> 15098.66s]  see what just happened there he's doing it in the order they pop up not in the order that they're
[15098.66s -> 15113.74s]  in the way he's doing it no he's not he's just doing the closest one he's not the middle was
[15113.74s -> 15123.22s]  up for ages he's just knocking them down as they pop up i swear to god if it's because ghibli is
[15123.22s -> 15150.81s]  like seven percent slower i'm gonna be real angry he upgraded the character ghibli's upgraded too
[15151.77s -> 15161.51s]  about that there's no speed upgrade there are two ladders near each other he goes there instead
[15161.51s -> 15169.10s]  of wasting time going all the way down the middle so he's genuinely doing them as they pop up
[15171.18s -> 15177.35s]  all right i'm gonna i'm going aragon i'm gonna try it let's go i think i got it
[15183.22s -> 15219.99s]  i think i got it i'm going aragon boys and girls you ready let's go let's say check the
[15219.99s -> 15223.75s]  description on the video there's no fucking way this person's watching the stream where is the
[15223.75s -> 15235.88s]  horse and the rider where is the horn that is blowing i got two there are enough for us both
[15235.88s -> 15274.73s]  ghibli he's way faster he's way faster than ghibli it's not even a fucking contest you gotta be
[15274.73s -> 15280.89s]  kidding me did i seriously waste all that fucking time because i was playing as the character that
[15280.89s -> 15285.37s]  was a little bit slower than everybody else no way i is this just is this like a placebo effect
[15286.09s -> 15308.50s]  i feel like it's like five times as many people on the screen am i getting placebo
[15327.82s -> 15340.25s]  um this this just feels just different like this just feels different to me i don't know what drugs
[15340.25s -> 15368.97s]  i'm on but this is different you know what i'm saying let's ignore the left side i think he is
[15369.61s -> 15430.42s]  he is right i'm not going crazy right thanks for getting in my way everybody um come on i need some
[15430.42s -> 15467.30s]  spawns that was incredibly inefficient it's okay i'm at zero bar i swear to god get the fuck out
[15467.30s -> 15492.28s]  of my way you punk one guy spinning around in goddamn circles you might you're not really
[15492.28s -> 15505.13s]  gonna let this fucking happen are you get out of the way how did that not hit how did that not hit
[15505.13s -> 15512.76s]  and i'm blocking i'm not swinging i'm blocking i don't want to i'm level two is aragon guys i
[15512.76s -> 15538.52s]  can't take like two hits fucking god there's only three ladders up how the fuck did this many people
[15538.52s -> 15556.86s]  out right now oh god i'm gonna fucking puke i really am so many people over here i'm gonna
[15556.86s -> 15570.62s]  get hit and die blocking is not running when you parry it doesn't do anything it's you don't even
[15570.62s -> 15574.70s]  get a second of like hip recovery you just don't take damage it doesn't do anything else
[15575.34s -> 15595.93s]  i'm fucked i had to do it i'm getting a fucking run the same shit keeps fucking happening to me
[15602.81s -> 15605.37s]  right side right side right right right right right right right come on aragon go
[15606.09s -> 15640.10s]  here we go all right all right now don't fuck this up damn it there's so many people i'm telling you
[15640.10s -> 15650.68s]  during the fucking cutscenes it continues i'm stuck in the corner jesus christ give me the help
[15651.32s -> 15666.66s]  please don't you even fucking dare i'm being you're all body blocking right now and it's driving me
[15666.66s -> 15682.97s]  mad what just what the fuck just happened what just happened i insta died i instantly fucking
[15682.97s -> 15689.13s]  died what the fuck just happened i was trying to dodge and not get and and excuse that's the
[15689.13s -> 15695.21s]  first time that's ever happened that's the first time that's ever fucking happened i got instantly
[15695.21s -> 15699.53s]  killed by what was it what did i die it shot a fireball at you i should have five but wasn't
[15699.53s -> 15726.02s]  i standing behind them i got catapulted i it was because i was alongside the wall i did better
[15726.02s -> 15731.14s]  that time with aragon do i really have to go back and play all these fucking levels again with this
[15731.14s -> 15748.36s]  dude i don't why is this nine straight minutes i honestly don't believe you can try change this
[15748.52s -> 15775.21s]  i guarantee you won't beat helms deep part one he bought the game for this no i didn't
[15776.47s -> 15799.62s]  one of the best ps2 games yeah i why don't you attack because it's an inefficient use of time
[15800.34s -> 15810.87s]  for some reason and i don't know why attacking any any orc on this cliff is an inefficient use
[15810.87s -> 15819.94s]  of any of even one second of your time we just watched the world record speed run but the dude
[15819.94s -> 15827.13s]  just runs around in circles 10 more minutes till the next height the speed runner attacked and i
[15827.13s -> 15836.30s]  also i we're going left we're going right side i got i just got hit directly in the head with one
[15836.30s -> 15843.10s]  of those and it didn't kill me it was because i got hit with a giant catapult in the fucking head
[15855.27s -> 15864.86s]  i think i may have unlocked the ultimate strategy no i didn't never mind it's too sloppy to be able
[15864.86s -> 15877.61s]  to do that no that's not gonna work this tube there's too much body collision to even attempt
[15877.61s -> 15917.03s]  to attack a person up here i was gonna okay one of this one spawned over here so i was like you
[15917.03s -> 15939.80s]  know what fucking i'm going this way that's stuck stuck stuck awesome it didn't even it got the one
[15939.80s -> 15944.28s]  time that the motherfucker doesn't swing for three straight seconds that always just spinning in a
[15944.28s -> 15951.16s]  circle randomly flailing around trying to hit anything and that one time am i gonna get hit
[15951.16s -> 15976.30s]  by more of this shit am i gonna it's been eight hours how am i screaming i've been serving eight
[15976.30s -> 15995.70s]  hours holy shit i thought it was like four i'm gonna die i can't like i'm fucking dead i'm dead
[15995.70s -> 16001.54s]  wish i could see the right side of the screen right now you know what a fucking miracle god
[16001.54s -> 16021.64s]  saw me god did that for me god don't care there's only one way this is possible we have to get
[16021.64s -> 16026.81s]  fire has to rain down here right now you can't physically even fucking walk
[16028.66s -> 16070.30s]  no speed run done over miracle is there gonna be a miracle nope why is it this complicated
[16072.06s -> 16075.10s]  why does it why did it have to be this ridiculous
[16078.44s -> 16099.35s]  fuck man i don't even like i can't even comprehend it helms deep is hard game gotta be hard i don't
[16099.35s -> 16103.27s]  even so all right this last time i'm doing it i'm gonna go shovel pizza in my fucking nose
[16105.35s -> 16109.90s]  you have to grind i can't even play the other levels with another character
[16109.90s -> 16113.82s]  i was gonna go back and play care i was gonna go back and play the other levels with gimli i
[16113.82s -> 16153.86s]  can't even do him him is forever at level five is it all just spawn at the same time too did i try

[16533.32s -> 16541.22s]  uncompletable encounter are you kidding me look what happened it was everything was fine
[16541.94s -> 16562.66s]  what stage three happens and then
[16568.06s -> 16578.74s]  is this even beatable do i have a broken copy of the game hey what's up joel hey what's up everybody
[16578.74s -> 16584.10s]  hey welcome to the stream i'm currently uh beating i have a bootleg broken copy of uh

[16592.82s -> 16598.90s]  three on speedrun i don't want i don't want to do that again i don't i do i don't want to do what
[16598.90s -> 16605.35s]  we just did again i would rather rip all my eyebrow hairs out and eat them than do what we just did
[16605.35s -> 16617.19s]  one more time i'd rather eat i'd rather eat corn on the cob with the husk still on than do this
[16617.19s -> 16637.80s]  level again i can't what do you mean watch the phase three thing this is just so bogus i can't
[16637.80s -> 16646.50s]  even what the fuck i'm what okay let's watch the world record speedrun on how to how to complete
[16646.50s -> 16652.94s]  helms deep level one i feel bad for all the fucking 13 year olds that played this back in the day
[16653.82s -> 16659.61s]  that didn't have a youtube speedrun of the best player in the whole entire world but watch do this
[16662.20s -> 16689.26s]  so they could complete their game what does he do phase three phase three come on is the game
[16689.26s -> 16700.97s]  drops of meteors okay here's phase three what the fuck dude come on there he goes kicks him down
[16711.96s -> 16739.70s]  he's doing the same damn thing he hit that one guy why is he not taking damage all right he's
[16739.70s -> 16759.21s]  not taking damage he just got hit by a meteor and like eight swings even when i was on gimli i was
[16759.45s -> 16780.55s]  taking more damage here what's he doing can he hear me it's not that far after that either
[16781.35s -> 16788.38s]  but anyways thanks joel for the ray welcome everybody i'm currently in a in a little bit
[16788.38s -> 16799.37s]  of a pickle i'm trying so hard to do this i'm straight for eight hours trying to do the oh man
[16799.37s -> 16806.71s]  man man man man man man just don't get hit by the meteors just don't get hit oh what time is it
[16807.43s -> 16822.95s]  it's late it's gone the gray bar underneath his health bar is a second health bar he's looking at
[16822.95s -> 16830.07s]  another youtube video no i just like aragon i got but is it really is gimli slower is okay can we
[16830.07s -> 16841.08s]  please figure that out without us either no doubt at all is gimli actually slower he is god damn it
[16841.08s -> 16849.78s]  why did i pick him like yes he is according to the wiki and it feels slower i have to
[16853.86s -> 16895.13s]  oh this level is very quick and it's just a boss and it's like 10 15 000 experience oh by the way
[16895.13s -> 16904.31s]  joel if you're watching i'm not sure we're gonna be doing a screen tomorrow wrong screen i got it
[16904.31s -> 16910.25s]  because this is going on like eight nine ten hours uh i'm not sure i'll be streaming tomorrow
[16911.13s -> 16925.11s]  you can see you can see just give me my experience and do the health upgrades and then just run
[16926.07s -> 16937.94s]  fear the lies and god only germa stopped after the first game to defuse bombs
[16938.90s -> 16953.56s]  all right and there's also a certain threshold where i'm completely out of gas too
[16954.28s -> 16957.08s]  i may have already hit that yeah i think it may have i think i hit there already
[16957.88s -> 16969.27s]  he's level two i can't do this at level two insult to injury he comes and shoots the

[17726.66s -> 17733.98s]  all right i think metaphysically it could be better theoretically could be doing better but
[17733.98s -> 17744.44s]  hypothetically i'm doing just fine i mean my pants are just just wet i must have pissed my pants like

[23304.04s -> 23312.92s]  and hit some lady in the face and apparently started this massive altercation out here
[23314.42s -> 23324.22s]  they've started picking sides and actually i like if you can see there's there's two people down

[23964.22s -> 23970.38s]  has been streaming for and making videos for almost 10 years and still can't figure out
[23970.38s -> 23974.86s]  how to set up a fucking proper compressor on his microphone so every half second you hear
[23980.22s -> 23984.06s]  wow is it it's surprising roger you think that somebody that went to
[23984.06s -> 23991.59s]  literal film school and has almost 10 years of experience wouldn't get so upset about somebody
[23991.59s -> 24023.99s]  throwing a mcchicken at him out a window legolas come on fight through i hate this

[24182.92s -> 24231.10s]  shield and then you can't even swing a normal swing this seriously is fucking crazy there's

[24335.40s -> 24380.84s]  quantum computing this mission reminds me of when you go into gary's mod and you just spawned like
[24380.84s -> 24387.83s]  20 scientists versus like 40 fucking ant lines and you just look and just watch from
[24387.83s -> 24407.30s]  100 feet above all right here we go roger seems that they've made it into the store
[24407.30s -> 24438.70s]  i'm not sure i'm not sure what they're after all right it's it's block xr2 right are these guys
[24438.70s -> 24470.57s]  urakais they i don't have the urakai one though i'm just gonna snipe people why do any other move
[24470.57s -> 24488.92s]  i mean i don't have combos but it's it's kind of hard to even see what where what what direction
[24488.92s -> 24498.46s]  my weapon is even swinging i could block square you know our xr2 i got the battle of home depot
[24498.46s -> 24528.92s]  in front of me get rid of all the shields that didn't kill you all right here we go legolas
[24529.56s -> 24539.69s]  coming gates in good shape i thought he had zero health for a second i was about to say
[24539.69s -> 24570.65s]  did i get bugged out of all my ex and my bum and my ex and my bum and my bum
[24571.53s -> 24598.63s]  just standing in the way you fuck face he's still playing this

[24753.69s -> 24772.10s]  get in there and fucking hit somebody like this is
[24777.21s -> 24789.85s]  do it oh there's my technique quickly what
[24792.17s -> 24801.56s]  uh roger it seems that uh the guy playing gmod spawned two antlions
[24802.44s -> 24810.54s]  well we can't really see anywhere where i just i have no view of anything actually roger
[24811.50s -> 24819.70s]  yeah there's a whole lot of noise uh looks like they're gonna get through the game again
[24820.50s -> 24838.63s]  let him do it roger don't let him roger don't change the channel
[24865.27s -> 24868.60s]  oh no i think i have to uh i think i have to
[24870.12s -> 24896.36s]  whatever they got it we tried sauron wins how do we even know how do we even know sauron's gonna be
[24896.36s -> 24908.81s]  that bad right he what if he's what if he's he's a murderer didn't sauron say like let me tell you
[24908.81s -> 24922.23s]  something sauron what's the what's the crisply line that he says end up sauron and you sauron is
[24922.23s -> 24928.71s]  one of the most disgusting horrible men in the world join me and together we will destroy the
[24929.59s -> 24943.88s]  sauron this is s word sit together we will destroy the sith he's in another movie what a
[24943.88s -> 24978.98s]  fucking phenomenal actor by the way lock this shit don't work do or do not do there is no try
[24980.10s -> 24986.39s]  i have no idea what's going on i don't think 5500 people who know what's going on
[24987.27s -> 25023.29s]  hey you ready for the nearly impossible level i guess so but i guess so i'll be honest though
[25023.29s -> 25027.13s]  like imagine watching the lord of the rings and aragon drops on his ass this many times you'd be
[25027.13s -> 25053.58s]  like this movie sucks look how many times i'm just getting knocked on the ground this is what it looks
[25053.58s -> 25070.84s]  like when you fail every qte get it get it get it get it get it i have a perfect you should be dead
[25071.48s -> 25075.51s]  i'm coming i'm coming i'm coming i'm coming i'm coming i'm okay but to get back to the uh
[25078.52s -> 25088.63s]  thing i just got hit by a bomb archers behind i don't think that happens yet i think i have to
[25088.63s -> 25098.54s]  go back down here first can we skip this game please um you're uh you're 10 and a half hours
[25098.54s -> 25115.32s]  late so i'm sorry but you're 10 and a half hours late archers we're in two helms deep right now
[25115.32s -> 25143.34s]  you're right this shit's going down this used to be a fellowship stream and then it turned into a
[25143.34s -> 25178.71s]  beat the entire second game screen how can there be this many people where are the archers thank you
[25181.90s -> 25187.46s]  yes you fucking ruined everything
[25199.46s -> 25229.82s]  oh just somebody deal with this guy hot hot back to the gate smooth it out in

[26247.62s -> 26254.78s]  this entire last level is just whipped 400 dice in the air did you get a 92 do it again

[26382.60s -> 26388.10s]  rug burn on my arms from my chair well it's hard to not be in the middle when you start in the
[26388.10s -> 26472.04s]  middle i thought that was a death sound when it's perfect you just got sniped what is this cluster
[26472.04s -> 26479.40s]  fuck somebody said i should come to the stream right now what the fuck is they what are they
[26479.40s -> 26488.82s]  doing man i imagine just opening the game imagine opening this and the first thing you see is like
[26495.10s -> 26499.74s]  don't you think you immediately click the x or you'd be like holy shit it's like it's like
[26499.74s -> 26526.57s]  gdq wrapping up i'm on i'm in perfect is he out of his zone to be able to die
[26527.61s -> 26549.94s]  that's supposed to be one hit kill bro use the arrows imperfect yeah i know i know i should be

[26576.84s -> 26592.10s]  here i can't see anything give me that full help perfect let's just shoot arrows at me i think
[26592.10s -> 26593.78s]  they're showing like this in the face
[26608.46s -> 26656.89s]  oh look at us doing a great job keep it up thumbs up wink this game has an average playtime of six
[26656.89s -> 26664.73s]  hours for the main story fuck that yeah right liars bullshit you've seen you look at what's
[26664.73s -> 26668.97s]  happening on screen right now and you think somebody's gonna beat this in less than five
[26668.97s -> 26692.71s]  or six hours that's horseshit what happened was this what happened to that guy all right are
[26692.71s -> 26700.39s]  they dead i can't even fucking look five hours fuck off five hours fuck off with that not a
[26700.39s -> 26723.34s]  chance in hell he's a gimli main that's why it's like all super powered fucking orcs at the gate
[26723.34s -> 26736.65s]  right now do you understand like it's all these super powered motherfuckers five hours by the way
[26737.53s -> 26747.13s]  this is like playing dark souls against 60 people at the same fucking time no way you took five
[26747.13s -> 26765.24s]  hours to beat this i refuse to understand or believe you i have to get to level 10 or it's
[26766.04s -> 26786.65s]  actually impossible how a level 10 fix it i don't know it gets me away from having to see the same
[26786.65s -> 26795.26s]  smudged smeared across screen of 100 people swinging and falling down it lets me break it
[26795.26s -> 26838.10s]  up a little somebody said back when games were hard back when games were hard just do combos
[26838.10s -> 26849.90s]  i'm doing the two or three combos that i have here are my combos here's the other one you've
[26849.90s -> 26857.69s]  seen me do that move 500 times the walkthrough for this level starts with oh my sweet loving god
[26857.69s -> 26866.70s]  this mission is so hard it makes the previous two missions look easy why is he not let's go blow
[26866.70s -> 26882.79s]  you're wasting time gandalf how did you beat this as a kid guys i may have just gotten to like the
[26882.87s -> 26909.91s]  second level and gone well this is fun i like lord of rings sorry about your tables all right
[26909.91s -> 26916.31s]  will you fucking i've leveled up everything and i can't even kill a standard uruk-hai
[26917.19s -> 26956.34s]  with a couple of slashes you just don't have oh man get out of my move move move move move
[26956.98s -> 26988.38s]  oh sorry we have to get in the way slaughter this motherfucker i think i'm stuck in the wall
[26989.02s -> 27005.78s]  i'm stuck in the wall there we go i found a way out that's what i wanted so i can kill you in one
[27005.78s -> 27028.01s]  hit is this hit and run too it might as well be this might be harder than hitting run
[27030.28s -> 27042.30s]  where i'm almost of the whole trilogy almost why is there a family photo in the top right
[27042.30s -> 27055.19s]  corner because i have to save the people in the building we've peaked too early in the year what
[27055.19s -> 27058.47s]  do you mean we peaked too early all right i have to i don't know they're gonna die if i don't do
[27058.47s -> 27088.86s]  this right now oh damn it they swing they swing so much faster than i do and the family's dead
[27088.86s -> 27095.34s]  where are these family members where are you are you just standing around waiting to die
[27096.30s -> 27107.51s]  where even are you did you just let these guys kill you blocking doesn't do anything trust me
[27108.70s -> 27122.68s]  trust me when you block it you just it's easy you can block against one guy but when you're
[27122.68s -> 27148.33s]  surrounded by 12 people you're gonna get smoked i just dropped my mouse who cares not even level
[27148.33s -> 27166.22s]  10 by the way do i get my upgrade screen all right what the hell am i buying but look at how
[27166.22s -> 27175.61s]  long this move takes to kill one person one two three four it's almost five full seconds
[27180.01s -> 27192.78s]  it's an instant kill but it takes i'm doing i got it there you go i got it how am i going
[27192.78s -> 27201.72s]  to pull this off in the sea of fucking humans don't you guys remember the hobbit sneaking game
[27202.44s -> 27217.00s]  what happened to that so i can instant kill in uruk-hai and instant kill any orc in the whole
[27217.00s -> 27223.88s]  game i have to block press x and then r2 it should kill instantly kill every single work in the whole
[27223.88s -> 27246.73s]  game that's i'll try i probably should have picked another level to practice it we didn't
[27246.73s -> 27270.70s]  yell fake rumbo's name fake rumbo okay so block and then x r2 okay you just you see how long this
[27270.70s -> 27295.46s]  is gonna take to do this to every single one of these guys one by one glad i picked it
[27308.87s -> 27312.33s]  no it's a waste of time i'm gonna do what i was doing before
[27358.18s -> 27367.35s]  he's hitting with the backswing now that's just annoying i'm damaging the gate with my moves
[27369.13s -> 27429.91s]  what no i'm not no way just run why are you still alive move move dermal is going to defend
[27429.91s -> 27441.51s]  helmsley for five full days you know it would be nice uh the kingdom of men dwarves and elves
[27441.51s -> 27493.50s]  if you sent more than three people that'd be great oh we're being attacked we're being overrun by orcs
[27494.30s -> 27499.82s]  it's okay we have three people oh what how many how many how many were there
[27499.82s -> 27506.06s]  sorry sorry kandalf we were there 600 million fucking orcs oh yeah don't worry we'll just have
[27506.06s -> 27553.16s]  three people to do this hey they did it in 300 i'd like 300 somewhere and while i try to block
[27553.16s -> 27559.72s]  no one attacks did you see that did you see that one i'm sitting there like spamming the
[27559.72s -> 27567.08s]  block button and everybody stands still arches on the wall you got it gimli coming right up i'll
[27567.08s -> 27589.75s]  take care of that just let me follow this real quick over here jesus christ doing better than
[27589.75s -> 27595.86s]  last time though by the way i'm breaking the disc in half when i'm done
[27606.73s -> 27612.55s]  oh by the way the second i get to the the last minute of the cutscene i'm gonna break the disc
[27612.55s -> 27649.85s]  in half with my teeth every single motherfucker has a fucking shield oh slow down jeremy i can't
[27649.85s -> 27687.40s]  even do a combo in here this is did anyone beat this did anyone beat this and i mean literally
[27687.40s -> 27709.03s]  one person one person on earth you can't block that you can't do anything they try i do i have
[27709.03s -> 27728.31s]  to stand oh my god hey just watch the speed run to figure out how to play the game normally
[27728.31s -> 27739.66s]  we cannot hold sounds about right you thought jump king was hard
[27745.14s -> 27751.94s]  all these fucking like dragged out 12 minute sequences and same thing over and over again
[27752.90s -> 27756.18s]  i don't feel like aragon right now i feel like i'm in the dryer
[27762.68s -> 27796.57s]  crazy bill fuck that move again it's like a lantern in the way
[27820.92s -> 27827.40s]  instant kill pauses ai but it doesn't pause people hitting the shelf with their swords
[27828.20s -> 27853.26s]  i'll come and get you i'm coming with my little sword this cost is 300
[27853.26s -> 27860.15s]  dollars at galaxy's edge and you can't even play with it because it's made out of glass
[27861.11s -> 27902.07s]  stab stab stabbing head stabbing head okay go use the insta kill use the insta kill it'll save you
[27913.34s -> 27920.81s]  no i'm going here we go it's these urakais you gotta get over here before they get in
[27921.69s -> 27969.14s]  all right just figured out where i was i have no idea i'm truly gone at this point
[27969.94s -> 28011.72s]  i'm like getting perfect somehow let's go god are you fucker you motherfucker he's still chasing
[28011.72s -> 28020.92s]  me no that's just useless legolas he's still chasing me it's scratch that you know i'd like
[28020.92s -> 28033.27s]  if they send more three characters i'd like it if they send more than one me that's it is there
[28033.27s -> 28049.18s]  anymore i think that's it that's it that's it that's it let's go it's the same guy with
[28049.18s -> 28061.94s]  shields still following me no one will kill him same fucking thing happens super powered
[28061.94s -> 28070.47s]  fucking mutants look at the there's like 10 of these guys they're like unstoppable it's the
[28070.47s -> 28079.59s]  hardest enemy in the game and they're like just lining up they're super mutants if only i had an
[28079.59s -> 28093.35s]  instant kill it's so oh just do the instant kill i can't even tell what's happening on the screen
[28093.43s -> 28104.34s]  it's this one fucking guy the guys that you can't kill you can't swing at these guys
[28105.67s -> 28122.22s]  where am i what the fuck is happening this is out fucking for ages this is out this is worse than
[28122.22s -> 28130.63s]  gary's mod gary's mod what the shit can't even happen there's like ai ceilings there's literally
[28130.71s -> 28135.08s]  ai ceilings in gary's book too many processes going on the same time
[28137.74s -> 28159.35s]  imagine playing this on anything other than normal holy fuck holy here come the trolls to
[28159.35s -> 28163.75s]  break it down instantly stick to the plan there is no plan you can't have a plan when there's
[28163.75s -> 28170.39s]  a hundred people spamming moves spamming at you on the screen there's no plan there is no plan
[28170.39s -> 28203.66s]  where are the trolls where are the trolls where are the trolls did i can you imagine putting it
[28203.66s -> 28212.76s]  on this that there's there what on earth would you have it on there for you want to just do it
[28212.76s -> 28238.17s]  for once just try it let's try it let's see what happens when the game's on expert do they swing
[28238.17s -> 28244.92s]  twice as fast do they have twice as much health does the wall have 50 left health left left health
[28245.72s -> 28286.87s]  the only thing i notice is the frame rate is worse you can't the shield doesn't break in one hit
[28289.29s -> 28304.70s]  what kind of mistake is that you know i'm saying it's a shield what kind of mistake
[28328.31s -> 28355.22s]  why have i not taken a single point of damage and now i have aragon he's stuck as my favorite
[28355.22s -> 28361.06s]  scene in one of the rings where aragon fell down every half second and when he spammed square in
[28361.06s -> 28361.86s]  the middle of people like this
[28402.57s -> 28432.25s]  he's already are you gonna kill him of aragon get over there this movie i love this movie
[28433.69s -> 28463.18s]  i don't know what he said whisperoto i don't know probably dead no one's checked on him in a while
[28463.90s -> 28516.81s]  who knows where he is he's retired archers this movie this seems longer than i remember i don't
[28516.81s -> 28532.58s]  remember there being a 45 minute helms deep scene in the movie i can't even get over here this is
[28532.58s -> 28539.30s]  like pushing your fucking face into quicksand is what this feels like i am smushing my face into
[28539.30s -> 28561.00s]  quicksand actually quicksand would probably feel better than this it's simulating how helms deep
[28561.00s -> 28590.23s]  was why are these now all of a sudden take two hits okay it's not fucking expert is that it that's
[28590.23s -> 28611.02s]  it all right come on clean it up here comes the trolls oh here comes the super mute

[29007.26s -> 29019.45s]  battle we are just this is a tricky part of the game where it simulates smashing your head into
[29019.45s -> 29025.05s]  a wall as hard as you can spinning around a circle 10 times and then picking up a playstation 2
[29025.05s -> 29054.94s]  controller and trying to play that's in the dev diary okay that guy was already dead hit the guys

[29429.05s -> 29433.45s]  still one that one half is holding one side of the controller the other half's holding the other
[29433.45s -> 29441.96s]  side and they're working together there's somebody is somebody hacking in my game this is like a speed
[29441.96s -> 29482.23s]  hacker in here jesus man children their brains would have exploded if they had touched this
[29483.40s -> 29490.78s]  keep your kids away from this game don't let them play they'll end up they'll end up with

[29618.54s -> 29640.28s]  this far but there's supposed to be 10 people here square x r2 square x r2 i don't know who i'm
[29640.28s -> 29646.26s]  aiming at this is where the camera just decides that it just don't give a fuck no more here we go
[29646.26s -> 29651.30s]  like we're gonna shake the screen and who gives a shit people floating around who gives a fuck
[29651.30s -> 29684.86s]  right like oh god it's already like dead there's no help there's so many i have to spam square
[29684.86s -> 29706.89s]  or i die there's no way it stands there's no way it stands it's over focus on the gate it's real
[29706.89s -> 29713.45s]  hard to do that when the screen is shaking and the screen is filled with bodies like i can't even
[29716.07s -> 29730.14s]  it's just it's like 10 out of 10 out fucking rage just cheese it stand on the stairs okay
[29730.14s -> 29740.98s]  do i actually have to break the game's code to play the game normally i have to break the game
[29740.98s -> 29759.45s]  play the fucking video game normally holy shit in my pants fill my stay on the stairs
[29760.17s -> 29784.76s]  what happens on the stairs uh this ain't working shoot towards the gate i mean it's the gates

[29827.43s -> 29833.83s]  get rising attack i don't think that's gonna help me though all right let's try the stairs again
[29836.60s -> 29844.07s]  stay on the stairs i i have to get ammo for my bow what these are wrong stairs
[29844.07s -> 30212.81s]  guys try the orc insta kill more it's just so hard to do when you're being spammed by
[30212.81s -> 30218.57s]  people in a circle it's it's oh block somebody and then press x and r2 but what you don't even
[30218.57s -> 30250.22s]  know who you're doing it to you don't even know who the fuck you're doing it to i thought the
[30250.22s -> 30257.70s]  stream ended hours ago no i'm still at uh what did what did the guide say the nearly impossible
[30257.70s -> 30289.14s]  level still here stay on the second floor all right try to get him down here all right legolas
[30289.14s -> 30299.06s]  get down here come on did they just continue to spawn up here they might because he's not going
[30299.06s -> 30315.74s]  anywhere he's not coming down this he's thought he's literally not going to come down these stairs
[30316.94s -> 30362.84s]  they just spawn just stay up here until the archers is that fucking going to happen
[30362.84s -> 30399.91s]  oh what gimli you're going to scream my name or what great camera it's fantastic it's the
[30399.91s -> 30404.63s]  best i've ever seen in a video game like top two top one top one ever
[30440.39s -> 30445.83s]  welcome to watch watching and watch wojo.com and today we're going to show you the top
[30446.79s -> 30456.01s]  one cameras in fucking playstation 2 history here it is why don't you stay up here
[30459.43s -> 30462.71s]  the point of going down there just kill everything up here until the until that this shit spawns
[30465.98s -> 30514.01s]  there's no health up here though break this motherfucking shield i need health man no don't
[30514.01s -> 30529.90s]  swing don't swing only swing when i don't want you to i need health though i need health i need
[30529.90s -> 30557.10s]  health it's a meteor okay where's i need health where's the troll i need health i need health so
[30557.10s -> 30562.12s]  bad i have to go down for the health i just help down here somewhere come on like let's down here
[30562.92s -> 30927.75s]  is it health down here
[30936.94s -> 30953.35s]  who's left who the fuck is what is going on over here really getting in your hours this week huh
[30953.35s -> 30958.55s]  i never thought i would be do i'll be doing this right now but like just out of principle i want
[30958.55s -> 30977.34s]  to beat this game right out of principle stay up here stay up here and fucking let the screen
[30977.34s -> 30982.60s]  shake by the way can i just say that screen shake is the shittiest thing that anyone has ever put
[30982.60s -> 30986.92s]  in their games why do you don't put don't get why do you put it even why is it in any game
[30987.96s -> 30997.59s]  at what point do you say hey like this game's kind of fun maybe we should shake the person's
[30997.59s -> 31006.54s]  screen like nobody everyone turns it off if it's available to turn off has anyone figured that out
[31006.54s -> 31025.37s]  yet in the gaming industry i turned off uh katana zero screen shake is it zero percent same with
[31025.45s -> 31030.70s]  motion blur i just don't get it is it to like hide the fact that like your game sucks
[31031.66s -> 31034.44s]  is that like why people do like a shit load of motion blur and stuff
[31044.55s -> 31051.14s]  yes because you don't want to see the trees popping in when they turn around too quickly
[31070.81s -> 31081.77s]  the arch is here yet i need health oh my fucking god need health all right i got some
[31086.23s -> 31105.10s]  this music's making me go insane imagine being the guy driving the car imagine i'm gonna drive for
[31105.10s -> 31114.65s]  this road trip you guys have been able to eat like eat snacks i've got my hands on the wheel
[31114.65s -> 31135.88s]  and my eyes blurry you've at least guys been able to eat some snacks can we not kill this guy
[31137.98s -> 31156.82s]  i'm not going down archers are coming up and they don't swing
[31159.40s -> 31175.91s]  why is this game so hard because up until 2004 people were just putting random code into the
[31175.91s -> 31187.93s]  engine and going oh shit i guess that works oh my god don't die don't die don't die at legolas
[31187.93s -> 31197.91s]  you have to fucking kill everybody here baston legolas pill that's not even a fucking device
[31201.19s -> 31212.38s]  that's not even a box i can open the fucking jesus christ somebody help me okay go back up the
[31212.38s -> 31254.28s]  stairs i thought i could open that box let's go all the way to the left oh my fucking god get this
[31254.28s -> 31261.30s]  motherfucker out of my way npc just standing in front of me
[31283.69s -> 31287.21s]  i don't even know what where i am i'm just holding down square i'm just
[31315.03s -> 31322.07s]  all the fucking archers dead in my favorite segment i have to go down here and get health
[31324.81s -> 31333.74s]  there's no health oh oh no this is bad it's over there's no health down here it's fucking
[31333.74s -> 31360.78s]  over there holy shit why don't you look you can't look i can't move the camera it's a resident evil
[31360.78s -> 31369.05s]  camera it goes wherever the fuck it wants it's a resident evil 4 tank camera let's three two one
[31394.18s -> 31402.60s]  you gotta call it this shit is fucking unbearable i can't even nobody can play this
[31403.48s -> 31424.82s]  the people play this wasn't there a dev here earlier did he beat this i wonder i wonder
[31429.16s -> 31438.42s]  that's 80 percent odds that the dev was fake oh i gotta put on my own music i'm done with the lord
[31438.42s -> 31446.20s]  of the rings music i'm putting on my own music my own damn music so i don't have to hear the same
[31446.68s -> 31453.14s]  oh
[31473.21s -> 31478.71s]  you have to beat it already then put on my fucking music
[31490.01s -> 31510.87s]  believable oh shit that's 10 and a half hours ago what am i gonna put on for music i don't know
[31510.87s -> 31529.13s]  what do we put on no no it's gotta be something relaxing it's gotta be chill music like something
[31529.13s -> 31532.50s]  like the wii menu music or something anything
[31585.67s -> 31590.30s]  this doesn't really fit with the theme of what's happening
[31590.30s -> 31624.42s]  i can't i can't i'm out of steam i'm out of gas there's no more gas in the tank
[31625.14s -> 31629.78s]  there's no more gas in the tank it's empty i'm fucking pushing it in neutral
[31629.78s -> 31668.95s]  oh there's no hills left i can push this down gate's doing okay i guess
[31688.42s -> 31728.92s]  go back to the first game it's too late it's too late now i'm coming legolas i'll be there soon
[31731.24s -> 31737.08s]  ah that's all right it's all right
[31737.08s -> 31759.58s]  what's that it's all right
[31771.27s -> 31781.83s]  just hanging out after you help legolas go back down to the gate i don't i i don't know the gate
[31781.83s -> 31789.91s]  gets hammered if you go down there it gets you get it gets crushed i have to stay up here until
[31789.91s -> 31794.39s]  the arches and then well no no no no yes you don't you don't you talk about it yeah i know
[31794.39s -> 31797.67s]  what you mean no not like the archer that i'm playing with the arches that are on the walls
[31798.55s -> 31835.27s]  i i know what you mean like i like hands are getting stuck
[31842.42s -> 31844.10s]  like i was underneath my desk
[31852.82s -> 31876.44s]  worst part is if you miss that uh instant kill you just put your sword in the ground where are you
[31876.44s -> 31907.26s]  going archers not yet no we're no not yet i'm caught in here it's just garret you're just dead
[31907.26s -> 31914.57s]  if you're fighting more than three people you're just dead the the systems in place you know what
[31914.57s -> 31931.27s]  i'm saying i need health how many fucking people have to die here until this ship can i need a
[31931.27s -> 31934.39s]  health pack there's nothing down here
[31941.13s -> 31957.53s]  i need to get health it's gonna be a disaster is it health over here not over here okay got it
[31960.50s -> 31969.21s]  archers not yet archers hurry up and get here so i can fucking beat this shit
[31969.93s -> 32008.68s]  didn't even break the shield fuck the shield enemies like fuck these guys there's two
[32008.68s -> 32018.79s]  fierce swings it couldn't break the damn thing fuck you save these for the archers why are they
[32018.79s -> 32042.98s]  no archers it didn't take this long the last time up here they are okay let's go wait they're not
[32042.98s -> 32068.63s]  here just there yeah oh my god it's so painful i got okay i did it i did it i did it now
[32069.51s -> 32088.78s]  i need health too though this okay so there's two berserkers down there they have to die
[32088.78s -> 32094.34s]  the two there's two berserkers down here they have to die right now
[32100.26s -> 32104.42s]  of course they're both attacking me at the same fucking goddamn time
[32105.30s -> 32115.34s]  i don't even know what's hitting me what did he do what the fuck what did he grab me
[32117.29s -> 32136.25s]  what the fuck is happening all right where's the trolls where the trolls bring them in bring in
[32136.25s -> 32160.52s]  trolls now i got full health wait this is another berserker here I can't even stoo
[32164.04s -> 32181.46s]  come here They just killed the trolls easy easy let's go easy
[32202.26s -> 32207.03s]  I did it i did it i did it i did it i did it i did it i did it i did it i did it i did
[32207.03s -> 32209.03s]  I did it I did it I did it!
[32211.85s -> 32213.85s]  I did it I did it I did it
[32214.91s -> 32219.90s]  I did it I did it
[32220.02s -> 32227.84s]  Did I do it?
[32227.90s -> 32229.90s]  Is there another part to this?
[32243.26s -> 32244.62s]  I don't know
[32248.11s -> 32253.34s]  YES!
[32253.82s -> 32255.82s]  I don't have to do it anymore
[32256.26s -> 32259.04s]  Oh man its over
[32266.06s -> 32267.06s] arti
[32267.06s -> 32271.15s]  It's over. It's over. It's over.
[32271.15s -> 32274.58s]  Sauron and Saruman are titans.
[32274.58s -> 32277.58s]  Sauron and Saruman are dead.
[32277.58s -> 32285.08s]  But for all that we have won over, the ring remains hidden.
[32285.08s -> 32287.08s]  Let's take a look and see what I look like.
[32287.08s -> 32289.45s]  That we should seek to destroy it.
[32289.45s -> 32290.45s]  How do I look?
[32290.45s -> 32301.18s]  So the weapon of the hands of a hobbit each day brings it closer to the fires of Mandu.
[32301.18s -> 32304.89s]  Sauron fears you.
[32304.89s -> 32333.80s]  Is this the Shmeagol music?
[32333.80s -> 32334.80s]  You look hungry.
[32334.80s -> 32350.66s]  I am hungry.
[32350.66s -> 32353.66s]  The fucking Gollum music had to play the second I turned the camera on.
[32353.66s -> 32354.66s]  Give me a break.
[32354.66s -> 32373.54s]  I don't know what I even...
[32373.54s -> 32375.54s]  Nice mic noises. I know, I'm sorry.
[32375.54s -> 32381.30s]  Okay, so...
[32381.30s -> 32384.18s]  Wait, is that not the end of the game?
[32384.18s -> 32400.93s]  How is that not the end of the game?
[32400.93s -> 32407.76s]  I don't think I want anything else.
[32407.76s -> 32408.76s]  I guess I'll get this.
[32408.76s -> 32415.66s]  I told you I was going to do it.
[32415.66s -> 32418.66s]  I told you I was going to get past the first part of Fellowship of the Ring.
[32418.66s -> 32421.96s]  That's right. Fake Grumbo.
[32421.96s -> 32444.58s]  I told you I was going to do it.
[32444.58s -> 32447.82s]  I want my two dollars from you, fake Grumbo.
[32447.82s -> 32450.31s]  Although I made that part up.
[32450.31s -> 32452.31s]  You don't have to give me any money.
[32452.31s -> 32470.35s]  The process of the video game construction and the building of it...
[32470.35s -> 32473.35s]  is not made for fighting things.
[32473.35s -> 32476.35s]  Vigo, you didn't get to fucking Helm's Deep. Give me a break.
[32476.35s -> 32479.59s]  I'm surprised. I mean, it looks much more realistic.
[32479.59s -> 32484.48s]  It seems it goes to another level.
[32484.48s -> 32487.48s]  If you got to Helm's Deep, you'd probably be like, I refuse the interview.
[32487.48s -> 32498.38s]  I think Aragorn's aim video game is better than my outfit.
[32498.38s -> 32500.38s]  You sound so tired.
[32500.38s -> 32506.78s]  I'm glad I did it.
[32506.78s -> 32513.78s]  What I've seen of the video game seems to reflect the fact that the second movie, as opposed to the first one, is on a bigger scale.
[32513.78s -> 32517.78s]  And I'm looking forward to seeing them just as I am to seeing the rest of this game.
[32517.78s -> 32520.78s]  I've only seen a sample today.
[32520.78s -> 32527.56s]  I'm glad to see, for example, that sometimes Aragorn gets knocked over or falls down or rolls around.
[32527.56s -> 32533.57s]  And that his fighting style alters to fit the situation.
[32533.57s -> 32536.57s]  It's not always neat and tidy.
[32536.57s -> 32539.57s]  He falls down.
[32539.57s -> 32542.57s]  I love it when he falls down.
[32542.57s -> 32549.34s]  That's true. That's true. I like it when he falls down.
[32549.34s -> 32554.18s]  Somebody said he hates it.
[32554.18s -> 32557.18s]  Did you know Vigo Mortensen hates the game?
[32557.18s -> 32560.06s]  Wait, was that sarcastic?
[32560.06s -> 32565.06s]  Well, you know, I really love when he falls down and has to change and gets shit kicked out of him.
[32565.06s -> 32576.71s]  I didn't like being a lot slower.
[32576.71s -> 32579.71s]  I can't believe it was slower.
[32579.71s -> 32582.66s]  I can't believe he was slower.
[32582.66s -> 32584.66s]  I did that level like 20 times in a row.
[32584.66s -> 32587.66s]  And I didn't know that he was like 15% slower.
[32587.66s -> 32593.18s]  It took me actually like two or three solid tries.
[32593.18s -> 32599.18s]  You don't have to do so much darn hard work as you do when you're originally creating the character.
[32599.18s -> 32602.18s]  Shooting a film is necessarily very slow.
[32602.18s -> 32605.18s]  Wait, wait, wait. Go back. How do we go back? How do we go back? How do we pause?
[32605.18s -> 32607.18s]  How do we pause?
[32607.18s -> 32609.18s]  That was a grip.
[32609.18s -> 32611.18s]  Look at that grip.
[32611.18s -> 32614.18s]  He put his right hand over, I think, to grab the...
[32614.18s -> 32617.18s]  You fear to go into those mines.
[32617.18s -> 32619.18s]  That was a sick claw gamer grip.
[32619.18s -> 32628.48s]  You know what they're worth.
[32628.48s -> 32634.48s]  I enjoyed making the game because you don't have to do so much darn hard work as you do when you're originally creating the character.
[32634.48s -> 32639.00s]  Shooting a film is necessarily very slow.
[32639.00s -> 32643.00s]  The wonderful thing about the computer game is, of course, I don't have to get in the makeup.
[32643.00s -> 32647.01s]  When you do the game, you stand in the studio.
[32647.01s -> 32650.01s]  And you say, well, I think you ought to say this and this and this.
[32650.01s -> 32652.01s]  He's awesome, by the way.
[32652.01s -> 32653.01s]  All these wonderful lines.
[32653.01s -> 32655.31s]  Ambush! Ambush!
[32655.31s -> 32661.31s]  And then they take all that, and they incorporate it into the games, and you get some of the credit.
[32661.31s -> 32664.31s]  Those explosive devices must be destroyed.
[32665.31s -> 32666.31s]  This model of me is Gimli.
[32666.31s -> 32670.31s]  I'm such a vigorous, virile, attractive character.
[32670.31s -> 32672.31s]  He's really the only person you want to play.
[32672.31s -> 32673.31s]  I mean, the rest.
[32673.31s -> 32676.31s]  The Aragorns, the Legolas.
[32676.31s -> 32678.31s]  Handsome, good-looking guys and all that.
[32678.31s -> 32684.31s]  But for real quality warfare, you have to go for a Gimli.
[32684.31s -> 32691.74s]  We spent 14 months in the most beautiful locations in the world in New Zealand to get the right look for the film.
[32691.74s -> 32693.74s]  The game is a wartime combat situation.
[32693.74s -> 32695.74s]  Because you betrayed him.
[32695.74s -> 32697.74s]  And it's wonderfully and brilliantly-
[32697.74s -> 32698.74s]  I didn't betray him!
[32698.74s -> 32701.05s]  I can't leave him there!
[32701.05s -> 32705.05s]  They made it impossible to beat the ladder level with him.
[32705.05s -> 32706.05s]  That's not my fault.
[32706.05s -> 32709.05s]  It's a new addiction that I have discovered.
[32709.05s -> 32712.61s]  So, Gamesters, well done.
[32712.61s -> 32716.61s]  Congratulations on getting into this little niche that gives you the interview.
[32716.61s -> 32720.61s]  I wish I could tell you how to play the game better, but in fact, I could never get to this level.
[32720.61s -> 32721.61s]  Good luck with it.
[32721.61s -> 32722.61s]  Gamesters.
[32723.61s -> 32726.61s]  Oh, he's so wonderful.
[32726.61s -> 32732.11s]  I could just listen- I could listen to him talk all day.
[32732.11s -> 32736.57s]  He's just- he's phenomenal.
[32736.57s -> 32740.66s]  Do we have any more?
[32740.66s -> 32741.97s]  Oh, no.
[32741.97s -> 32748.86s]  Oh, I need level 10 with Aragorn and we get the super secret video?
[32748.86s -> 32751.74s]  What's down here?
[32751.74s -> 32759.42s]  What level- how close am I now?
[32759.42s -> 32760.85s]  I can't.
[32760.85s -> 32763.09s]  I can't replay anything.
[32763.09s -> 32766.67s]  I didn't get to level 10.
[32766.67s -> 32773.50s]  Wait, whoa, whoa, since when can I do that?
[32773.50s -> 32776.18s]  Since when can I do that?
[32776.18s -> 32777.18s]  Oh, because I beat the game.
[32777.18s -> 32778.18s]  Now I can do it.
[32778.18s -> 32779.18s]  I beat the game.
[32779.18s -> 32783.43s]  I see.
[32783.43s -> 32786.43s]  I don't want to- I don't want to see that ever again.
[32786.43s -> 32805.02s]  Alright, for all the shit that I was talking about the game, you do have to give some credit here.
[32805.02s -> 32807.02s]  This shit was 20 years ago.
[32807.02s -> 32812.28s]  This is pretty damn cool for 20 years to go, except for these three levels.
[32812.28s -> 32815.31s]  Delete them.
[32815.31s -> 32816.31s]  And this one.
[32816.31s -> 32819.60s]  And this one.
[32819.60s -> 32825.38s]  2001.
[32825.38s -> 32834.17s]  If I remember correctly, Return of the King is a much more polished, better video game.
[32834.17s -> 32840.72s]  I didn't like this one.
[32840.72s -> 32842.72s]  This one was- this one was good.
[32842.72s -> 32845.72s]  I didn't- okay, let's go- let me- let me reassess here.
[32845.72s -> 32847.09s]  Cool.
[32847.09s -> 32848.33s]  That was cool.
[32848.33s -> 32849.33s]  Fighting the ringwraiths, yeah.
[32849.33s -> 32853.34s]  We had to get- no, this is when they were breaking through the ice and stuff.
[32853.34s -> 32854.34s]  That was cool.
[32854.34s -> 32858.34s]  This is the big- the big troll with the- yeah, that was cool.
[32858.34s -> 32859.90s]  Um, eh.
[32859.90s -> 32862.26s]  I didn't like this one.
[32862.26s -> 32863.50s]  This one was good.
[32863.50s -> 32866.74s]  I like to walk around forests and you sneak around.
[32866.74s -> 32867.74s]  This one was cool.
[32867.74s -> 32869.74s]  No, don't like it.
[32869.74s -> 32875.30s]  This is not even a level.
[32875.30s -> 32877.30s]  This was just a door and then a boss.
[32877.30s -> 32879.30s]  So, I mean, it was okay.
[32879.30s -> 32880.30s]  Delete.
[32880.30s -> 32881.30s]  Good.
[32881.30s -> 32886.33s]  Alright, for how, like, horrendous this was.
[32886.33s -> 32889.53s]  It was still hysterical.
[32889.53s -> 32892.53s]  Like, do you remember our first four or five attempts in this level?
[32892.53s -> 32894.77s]  Just how much fun we were having.
[32894.77s -> 32902.59s]  We were having so much fun in the first five or six attempts.
[32902.59s -> 32904.59s]  Then an hour and a half went by.
[32904.59s -> 32913.00s]  Then I lost all the feeling in my tongue.
[32913.00s -> 32918.91s]  It's back now.
[32918.91s -> 32919.91s]  Twelve and a half hours.
[32919.91s -> 32927.74s]  Okay.
[32927.74s -> 32929.74s]  I want that ten- I want that level ten video.
[32929.74s -> 32941.71s]  Remember when he aspirated jerky?
[32941.71s -> 32943.71s]  Damn, it really has been a whole day.
[32943.71s -> 32953.57s]  How close was I to ten?
[32953.57s -> 32954.57s]  Okay.
[32954.57s -> 32958.19s]  Have I actually gone crazy?
[32958.19s -> 32959.19s]  YouTube.com.
[32959.19s -> 32972.10s]  Aragorn level ten video.
[32972.10s -> 32988.99s]  It doesn't exist on YouTube.
[32988.99s -> 32989.99s]  It doesn't exist on YouTube.
[32989.99s -> 32997.48s]  I want that- I want that fucking video.
[32997.48s -> 33000.48s]  I want to see Viggo Mortens talk about how much he loves the game again.
[33000.48s -> 33001.48s]  Look, this is going to be simple.
[33001.48s -> 33003.48s]  I'm, like, max level and shit.
[33003.48s -> 33007.45s]  Oh, look at how- I'm right there.
[33007.45s -> 33009.45s]  Oh, yeah, I'm right there.
[33009.45s -> 33010.82s]  Let's go.
[33010.82s -> 33020.82s]  What's the longest stream I've ever done?
[33020.82s -> 33025.47s]  What is actually the longest stream I've ever done?
[33025.47s -> 33026.90s]  Does anybody know?
[33026.90s -> 33029.72s]  It's now this one.
[33029.72s -> 33032.18s]  Is it actually this one now?
[33032.18s -> 33033.18s]  Level ten.
[33033.18s -> 33052.78s]  There it is.
[33052.78s -> 33055.15s]  We get the secret video.
[33055.15s -> 33064.54s]  Lifeline was pretty long.
[33064.54s -> 33066.54s]  I think it was, like, eleven and a half, though.
[33066.54s -> 33076.30s]  Come on.
[33076.30s -> 33092.91s]  Did I- wait, can I actually hit him?
[33092.91s -> 33095.60s]  Um, no.
[33095.60s -> 33107.59s]  Don't kill me.
[33107.59s -> 33110.54s]  Don't kill me.
[33110.54s -> 33116.64s]  He's going to be mad.
[33116.64s -> 33117.64s]  What do you mean mad?
[33117.64s -> 33123.57s]  Well, actually, I am a little bit mad.
[33123.57s -> 33125.87s]  Nothing to do with the video game, really.
[33125.87s -> 33133.54s]  It has to do with- I've been- I've been streaming on Twitch for, what, four- just five years?
[33133.54s -> 33134.54s]  Six years?
[33134.54s -> 33137.54s]  Like, just almost a full five years, right?
[33137.54s -> 33144.96s]  And the longest stream I've ever done is going to be for a long time.
[33144.96s -> 33147.96s]  Lord of the Rings The Two Towers on PlayStation 2.
[33147.96s -> 33157.90s]  I think that's more upsetting.
[33157.90s -> 33163.41s]  And the first Hobbit game.
[33163.41s -> 33165.41s]  Yeah, but that's not why this was so long.
[33165.41s -> 33176.86s]  Longest and worst stream.
[33176.86s -> 33179.04s]  I don't agree with that at all.
[33179.04s -> 33181.04s]  No, no, no, not even close.
[33181.04s -> 33183.04s]  I don't agree with that at all.
[33183.04s -> 33187.33s]  I had a fucking lot of fun on this stream.
[33187.33s -> 33190.33s]  I thought this was a lot of fun.
[33191.33s -> 33198.75s]  Yesterday's stream was the worst stream.
[33198.75s -> 33200.75s]  Oh, I see what you're doing.
[33200.75s -> 33202.75s]  Yeah, because this was streamed yesterday.
[33202.75s -> 33203.75s]  Oh.
[33203.75s -> 33208.91s]  This was- I had a lot of fun on this stream.
[33208.91s -> 33217.90s]  Alright.
[33217.90s -> 33218.90s]  Level 10.
[33218.90s -> 33219.90s]  Secret video.
[33219.90s -> 33220.90s]  Let's go.
[33220.90s -> 33239.39s]  The CCTV joke was worth ten hours of setup.
[33239.39s -> 33244.00s]  What's the final thing I'm going to buy, though?
[33244.00s -> 33245.00s]  Probably this thing.
[33245.00s -> 33259.87s]  And... this one.
[33259.87s -> 33262.26s]  Here we go.
[33262.26s -> 33263.44s]  Alright.
[33263.44s -> 33264.44s]  Vigo.
[33264.44s -> 33267.51s]  Tell me your secret-
[33267.51s -> 33269.51s]  Tell me your secrets, Vigo.
[33269.51s -> 33286.24s]  Aragorn.
[33286.24s -> 33287.24s]  Unplayed.
[33287.24s -> 33291.06s]  Let's play the video then.
[33291.06s -> 33293.81s]  It's about to be played.
[33293.81s -> 33319.54s]  What?
[33319.54s -> 33322.54s]  Floor 1 out of 20.
[33322.54s -> 33351.84s]  I'm not doing that.
[33351.84s -> 33352.84s]  We're not doing that.
[33352.84s -> 33353.84s]  I'm sorry.
[33353.84s -> 33354.84s]  I'm not doing- no.
[33354.84s -> 33355.84s]  No fucking way.
[33355.84s -> 33356.84s]  It's not- alright.
[33356.84s -> 33363.34s]  I want to watch this trending now on CNN.
[33363.34s -> 33376.08s]  This was probably somebody's first experience with Lord of the Rings.
[33376.08s -> 33378.08s]  Yeah, we talked about that earlier.
[33378.08s -> 33395.02s]  This was somebody's first stream.
[33395.02s -> 33397.02s]  Yeah, it was probably a lot of people's first streams.
[33397.02s -> 33398.26s]  Probably.
[33398.26s -> 33400.44s]  Where's the music?
[33400.44s -> 33402.74s]  I don't want any sounds right now.
[33402.74s -> 33404.74s]  I don't want any stimulation.
[33404.74s -> 33408.06s]  I just want to sit here.
[33408.06s -> 33412.86s]  No stimulation at all.
[33412.86s -> 33413.86s]  Except for this.
[33413.86s -> 33417.38s]  No stimulation.
[33417.38s -> 33418.38s]  Just quiet.
[33418.38s -> 33425.39s]  This is the only thing I want in my life right now.
[33428.36s -> 33434.92s]  The battle for- the battle for Home Depot.
[33434.92s -> 33441.18s]  Roger, people on social media are calling this the Battle of Home Depot.
[33441.18s -> 33450.18s]  This reporter cannot understand just how ridiculous this is, seeing this from above.
[33450.18s -> 33454.18s]  You don't see the other 300 people that are back behind the doors.
[33454.18s -> 33463.52s]  Holy shit, like, listen.
[33463.52s -> 33474.08s]  This is a mess.
[33481.98s -> 33483.66s]  Hello?
[33483.66s -> 33485.66s]  Wait, why is this not working?
[33485.66s -> 33486.66s]  There we go.
[33486.66s -> 33494.28s]  Is this- hello?
[33494.28s -> 33500.74s]  Hello?
[33500.74s -> 33501.74s]  Hello?
[33501.74s -> 33507.18s]  Yeah, guys.
[33507.18s -> 33512.90s]  So this is what happens.
[33512.90s -> 33521.22s]  This is what happens when you- yeah, it's been a long night.
[33521.22s -> 33526.58s]  So we're just gonna chill for a little bit.
[33526.58s -> 33529.58s]  You know, just hang out.
[33529.58s -> 33538.66s]  I might sound a little different, but that's because, you know, I've been yelling a lot tonight.
[33538.66s -> 33543.54s]  So I've been making a lot of noise.
[33543.54s -> 33552.26s]  I inhaled a piece of jerky, and that's kind of why I feel like I'm-
[33552.26s -> 33555.26s]  So for the bits of what- turn this off.
[33555.26s -> 33559.55s]  Someone was like, fuck, this is weird.
[33559.55s -> 33560.55s]  Todd Howard?
[33560.55s -> 33563.86s]  Todd Howard?
[33563.86s -> 33579.96s]  And next, coming up, we have our first mobile game experience.
[33579.96s -> 33580.96s]  I can't.
[33580.96s -> 33581.96s]  I have to go to bed.
[33581.96s -> 33596.13s]  If you thought for one second that we were not gonna go completely crazy here with Elder Scrolls Blades, that's the one.
[33596.13s -> 33610.29s]  Welcome to Fallout Con.
[33610.29s -> 33613.66s]  You can do some really weird shit with this thing, man.
[33613.66s -> 33614.66s]  I'll tell you.
[33614.66s -> 33615.66s]  Okay.
[33615.66s -> 33618.66s]  Like, for instance, what if I do this?
[33618.66s -> 33619.66s]  Ready?
[33619.66s -> 33622.22s]  Like, what if I go like this?
[33622.22s -> 33625.22s]  And then go like this, okay?
[33625.22s -> 33627.22s]  So right now- how does this sound now?
[33627.22s -> 33629.22s]  This probably sounds really weird.
[33629.22s -> 33631.22s]  Like, very strange.
[33631.22s -> 33632.84s]  Oh.
[33632.84s -> 33641.38s]  This is- this is, uh, this is one- this is one hour after two towers.
[33641.38s -> 33646.27s]  This is two hours after two towers.
[33646.27s -> 33650.37s]  Four hours after two towers.
[33650.37s -> 33652.37s]  This is six hours after two towers.
[33652.37s -> 33665.60s]  This is ten hours after two towers.
[33665.60s -> 33674.25s]  This is how I feel right now.
[33674.25s -> 33693.06s]  This is how I feel right now.
[33710.66s -> 33711.96s]  Hey.
[33711.96s -> 33712.96s]  Why- I sound weird now.
[33712.96s -> 33714.96s]  Why do I sound so strange to myself?
[33714.96s -> 33716.96s]  I sound weird to myself.
[33716.96s -> 33718.96s]  Anybody else sound weird to yourself?
[33718.96s -> 33719.96s]  Okay.
[33719.96s -> 33722.96s]  Um, I am gonna have to forego the bits tonight, guys.
[33722.96s -> 33723.96s]  I'm really sorry.
[33723.96s -> 33726.96s]  I feel like somebody just punched me in the face with a car.
[33726.96s -> 33729.96s]  Uh, we have like 12 hours- 13 hours of bits.
[33729.96s -> 33732.96s]  It's gonna take me like two or three hours to go through it.
[33732.96s -> 33737.96s]  Um, this is the second time we've moved bits to another day.
[33737.96s -> 33746.38s]  I'm really sorry about that, but, um, it's like I got- I got run over by a car.
[33746.38s -> 33749.38s]  It was a shitload of money and a shitload of people supported the channel.
[33749.38s -> 33751.38s]  You guys are fucking incredible.
[33751.38s -> 33753.38s]  I can at least run the credits.
[33753.38s -> 33754.94s]  Do them next time.
[33754.94s -> 33758.94s]  Yeah, by the way, this is not- I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[33758.94s -> 33760.94s]  This was- this was like a mega stream.
[33760.94s -> 33765.94s]  So what's gonna happen is you'll probably see- you'll see me again on Wednesday.
[33765.94s -> 33767.94s]  I'm gonna take a day or two here.
[33767.94s -> 33768.94s]  You'll see me on the 15th.
[33768.94s -> 33769.94s]  Wednesday the 15th.
[33769.94s -> 33772.75s]  This is an omega lol stream.
[33772.75s -> 33781.01s]  You ready for me to fix that once and for all?
[33781.01s -> 33785.21s]  Uh, it's because the- the- the heater turns on behind me.
[33785.21s -> 33788.28s]  I just figured it out.
[33788.28s -> 33792.85s]  Yep.
[33792.85s -> 33793.85s]  That's the heater.
[33793.85s -> 33796.85s]  And the gate is not high enough to mask the heater.
[33796.85s -> 33798.66s]  Figured it out.
[33798.66s -> 33808.76s]  Let me fix that right now.
[33808.76s -> 33814.93s]  There it is.
[33814.93s -> 33821.61s]  Got it.
[33821.61s -> 33824.06s]  That fixed it, right?
[33824.06s -> 33831.19s]  Okay.
[33831.19s -> 33832.19s]  Good.
[33832.19s -> 33833.19s]  Oh, wow.
[33833.19s -> 33835.19s]  I'm so sorry that that's been happening.
[33835.19s -> 33837.50s]  I'm so sorry about that.
[33837.50s -> 33839.50s]  I'm so s- I'm so sorry.
[33839.50s -> 33840.50s]  I'm so sorry.
[33840.50s -> 33841.50s]  Okay.
[33841.50s -> 33842.50s]  That sounds weird.
[33842.50s -> 33844.50s]  There's one more thing I want to do before I go.
[33844.50s -> 33847.93s]  Uh, let me look at this.
[33847.93s -> 33850.74s]  There's some weird shit here.
[33850.74s -> 33852.30s]  Hello?
[33852.30s -> 33853.30s]  Hold on.
[33853.30s -> 33854.30s]  Hello?
[33854.30s -> 33865.58s]  This is actually bad for Mike.
[33865.58s -> 33867.58s]  This is...
[33867.58s -> 33872.08s]  Okay.
[33872.08s -> 33875.08s]  There's a lot of random shit here.
[33875.08s -> 33880.10s]  It's me.
[33880.10s -> 33907.96s]  Hello?
[33907.96s -> 33912.58s]  This one's called- this one's called Big Ferb.
[33912.58s -> 33913.58s]  Big Ferb?
[33913.58s -> 33914.58s]  Uh...
[33914.58s -> 33917.49s]  Oh, Big Reverb!
[33917.49s -> 33918.49s]  Big Reverb!
[33918.49s -> 33919.49s]  Some of these are ridiculous.
[33919.49s -> 33920.49s]  I can be in a chapel.
[33920.49s -> 33922.69s]  I can be in a club.
[33922.69s -> 33923.69s]  This is in a music club.
[33923.69s -> 33925.25s]  This is a hockey arena.
[33925.25s -> 33926.25s]  Weird.
[33926.25s -> 33928.70s]  That's pretty ridiculous.
[33928.70s -> 33932.52s]  And you can do a lot of weird shit with this, too.
[33932.52s -> 33934.08s]  Okay.
[33934.08s -> 33940.31s]  I had my fun.
[33940.31s -> 33941.31s]  I will see you guys in a couple days.
[33941.31s -> 33942.31s]  Thank you again.
[33942.31s -> 33943.31s]  Here come the credits.
[33943.31s -> 33944.31s]  Go eat something?
[33944.31s -> 33946.45s]  Okay.
[33947.88s -> 33949.12s]  I had my fun.
[33949.12s -> 33954.06s]  I will see you guys in a couple days.
[33954.06s -> 33955.06s]  Thank you again.
[33955.06s -> 33956.06s]  Here come the credits.
[33956.06s -> 33957.06s]  Go eat something?
[33957.06s -> 33958.06s]  I...
[33958.06s -> 33959.06s]  I'm good.
[33959.06s -> 33962.48s]  I'll eat something.
[33962.48s -> 33966.48s]  Tell Joel, uh, sorry I did a 13-hour stream.
[33966.48s -> 33970.66s]  We'll- we'll schedule it for a few days or something.
[33970.66s -> 33976.03s]  Anybody even, like, streaming right now?
[33976.03s -> 33979.03s]  Do people stream on Twitch at, like, 4 o'clock in the morning?
[33979.03s -> 33980.03s]  I guess they do.
[33980.03s -> 33981.03s]  They ha- like, yeah, they do.
[33981.03s -> 33983.03s]  Who's streaming right now?
[33983.03s -> 33995.71s]  Uh...
[33995.71s -> 33996.71s]  You.
[33996.71s -> 33997.71s]  Oh, right.
[33997.71s -> 33999.71s]  Other countries exist, Jeremy.
[33999.71s -> 34001.95s]  Yeah, they do.
[34001.95s -> 34005.79s]  I'm still on the front page.
[34005.79s -> 34009.06s]  I'm still on the front page.
[34009.06s -> 34010.06s]  Okay.
[34010.06s -> 34015.64s]  Everybody on the front page has a...
[34015.64s -> 34017.64s]  Everybody on the front page has, like, a...
[34017.64s -> 34018.64s]  Hey, this is the person.
[34018.64s -> 34019.64s]  This is the streamer.
[34019.64s -> 34020.64s]  This is the person that you...
[34020.64s -> 34021.64s]  Hey, check them out.
[34021.64s -> 34022.64s]  This is what they do.
[34022.64s -> 34024.64s]  They do this, this, this, and this.
[34024.64s -> 34029.50s]  Mine just says, video and streamer guy.
[34029.50s -> 34032.81s]  Mine just says, video and streamer guy.
[34032.81s -> 34039.26s]  I don't know how to do anything.
[34039.26s -> 34041.26s]  I don't know how to run a business.
[34041.26s -> 34042.26s]  I need to run a business.
[34042.26s -> 34045.07s]  This is my business.
[34045.07s -> 34047.07s]  Who else has, like...
[34047.07s -> 34053.65s]  This is my business.
[34053.65s -> 34055.65s]  Germanite5 Incorporated.
[34055.65s -> 34057.72s]  No, I don't know.
[34057.72s -> 34058.72s]  Who gives a shit?
[34058.72s -> 34060.34s]  I don't care.
[34060.34s -> 34061.34s]  All right.
[34061.34s -> 34062.34s]  That has been fun.
[34062.34s -> 34063.34s]  I'll see you guys later.
[34063.34s -> 34064.71s]  Here come the credits.
[34064.71s -> 34067.71s]  Actually, we're gonna sit here and let them roll through.
[34067.71s -> 34073.34s]  Close to 13 hours?
[34073.34s -> 34076.18s]  Yeah.
[34076.18s -> 34077.18s]  Look at this.
[34077.18s -> 34079.18s]  You massacred my business.
[34079.18s -> 34081.83s]  What the fuck?
[34081.83s -> 34088.45s]  Grandma's stocks are dropping.
[34088.45s -> 34090.69s]  Um, that's okay.
[34090.69s -> 34092.69s]  It's not all about how high.
[34092.69s -> 34093.69s]  What the fuck is...
[34093.69s -> 34094.69s]  What's happening?
[34094.69s -> 34095.69s]  Somebody talking in my head.
[34095.69s -> 34097.18s]  Oh, no.
[34097.18s -> 34098.18s]  These are the front page streams.
[34098.18s -> 34099.18s]  Okay.
[34099.18s -> 34101.96s]  These are the front page streams.
[34101.96s -> 34105.25s]  Okay.
[34105.25s -> 34106.25s]  Gotta get off the front page.
[34106.25s -> 34110.22s]  What is the title of this stream?
[34110.22s -> 34116.18s]  Oh, I guarantee you will like the first part of Two Towers.
[34116.18s -> 34117.18s]  We did.
[34117.18s -> 34119.42s]  That last part, though.
[34119.42s -> 34120.42s]  We did.
[34120.42s -> 34124.18s]  That last part and maybe not so much.
[34124.18s -> 34126.18s]  But I still did.
[34126.18s -> 34129.12s]  I'm glad I streamed.
[34129.12s -> 34132.12s]  I'm glad I streamed Lord of the Rings Two Towers and beat it.
[34132.12s -> 34138.26s]  I hate that game.
[34138.26s -> 34139.26s]  Why?
[34139.26s -> 34142.49s]  Oh.
[34142.49s -> 34146.14s]  Well, this is a wild one.
[34146.14s -> 34147.14s]  Didn't plan on it.
[34147.14s -> 34148.14s]  This was gonna be just a...
[34148.14s -> 34152.27s]  I played Lord of the Rings Fellowship for two hours.
[34152.27s -> 34153.27s]  But what can I say?
[34153.27s -> 34154.27s]  Sometimes it happens.
[34154.27s -> 34155.27s]  Sometimes...
[34155.27s -> 34157.27s]  Sometimes this shit just happens.
[34157.27s -> 34163.74s]  I didn't plan hit and run either.
[34163.74s -> 34174.36s]  How does it feel to be a gamester?
[34174.36s -> 34175.36s]  Feels pretty good.
[34175.36s -> 34177.92s]  Feels pretty good.
[34177.92s -> 34181.99s]  I'm so glad I got rid of that background bullshit.
[34181.99s -> 34183.49s]  Hold on.
[34183.49s -> 34189.11s]  Let's put the compressor back on and see what it sounds like.
[34189.11s -> 34190.35s]  Hey.
[34190.35s -> 34191.35s]  Hey.
[34191.35s -> 34194.30s]  The compressor's back on.
[34194.30s -> 34199.30s]  Oh, now I know what you guys are talking about when you say this sounds fucking terrible.
[34199.30s -> 34202.92s]  I really thought everyone was just gaslighting me telling me that I was crazy.
[34202.92s -> 34204.92s]  This fucking sounds terrible.
[34204.92s -> 34206.92s]  This sounds awful.
[34206.92s -> 34208.92s]  See, now it sounds a lot better.
[34208.92s -> 34209.92s]  That sounds way better.
[34209.92s -> 34211.92s]  That sounds a thousand times better.
[34211.92s -> 34214.31s]  Holy shit.
[34214.31s -> 34215.31s]  I didn't believe you.
[34215.31s -> 34216.31s]  I really didn't.
[34216.31s -> 34219.31s]  I didn't believe a single word anybody was saying.
[34219.31s -> 34225.82s]  Because this is what it sounded like before.
[34225.82s -> 34228.95s]  Maybe I need to be closer to the mic.
[34228.95s -> 34231.38s]  It's just my room is so noisy.
[34231.38s -> 34232.38s]  That's the problem.
[34232.38s -> 34234.14s]  Oh, hey guys.
[34234.14s -> 34240.69s]  It's the podcast voice.
[34240.69s -> 34242.69s]  Good afternoon.
[34242.69s -> 34249.75s]  Hope everybody's having a great day today.
[34249.75s -> 34252.75s]  The following has encouragement.
[34252.75s -> 34253.75s]  That's what it is.
[34253.75s -> 34254.75s]  It's a bunch of compressed.
[34254.75s -> 34262.71s]  The following has encouragement and love.
[34262.71s -> 34265.71s]  We want to thank you for being here.
[34265.71s -> 34274.86s]  You're the one that gets things done around here.
[34274.86s -> 34276.86s]  Well, tell him.
[34276.86s -> 34280.94s]  A great job.
[34280.94s -> 34282.94s]  You're the one that gets things done around.
[34282.94s -> 34283.94s]  That's what he did.
[34283.94s -> 34284.94s]  Holy shit.
[34284.94s -> 34285.94s]  I love that guy.
[34285.94s -> 34286.94s]  Okay.
[34286.94s -> 34287.94s]  Let's go back to normal.
[34287.94s -> 34288.94s]  Hold on.
[34288.94s -> 34289.94s]  What if I do this?
[34289.94s -> 34290.94s]  Well, I think I fixed it.
[34290.94s -> 34291.94s]  Did I fix it even more?
[34291.94s -> 34292.94s]  I think I just fixed it even more.
[34292.94s -> 34295.50s]  I think I just fixed it even more.
[34295.50s -> 34296.50s]  Did I?
[34296.50s -> 34297.50s]  Hey.
[34297.50s -> 34298.50s]  How you guys doing?
[34298.50s -> 34299.50s]  Is it fixed?
[34299.50s -> 34300.50s]  Fixed even more?
[34300.50s -> 34301.50s]  Are we fixed even more?
[34301.50s -> 34302.50s]  How are we?
[34302.50s -> 34303.50s]  No, it's worse now.
[34303.50s -> 34304.50s]  How about now?
[34304.50s -> 34305.50s]  How about this?
[34305.50s -> 34308.80s]  Is it a little bit better from here?
[34308.80s -> 34314.42s]  Sounds exactly the same.
[34314.42s -> 34315.42s]  Now it sounds horrible.
[34315.42s -> 34323.40s]  What if I do this?
[34323.40s -> 34324.40s]  Okay.
[34324.40s -> 34325.40s]  I just did this.
[34325.40s -> 34327.02s]  All right.
[34327.02s -> 34328.02s]  Maybe now...
[34328.02s -> 34329.02s]  How's that?
[34329.02s -> 34331.02s]  Is that a little bit better?
[34331.02s -> 34336.36s]  Does this change anything?
[34336.36s -> 34338.36s]  Does it make it sound better?
[34338.36s -> 34340.50s]  Or no?
[34340.50s -> 34341.50s]  Still just as bad?
[34341.50s -> 34342.50s]  Go back?
[34342.50s -> 34344.06s]  Okay.
[34344.06s -> 34347.06s]  I'm still trying to get it to sound okay, you know?
[34347.06s -> 34350.54s]  Go back to podcast voice.
[34350.54s -> 34352.54s]  I really don't think you want me to go back to podcast voice.
[34352.54s -> 34356.85s]  Hold on.
[34356.85s -> 34357.85s]  What about this?
[34357.85s -> 34358.85s]  Okay.
[34358.85s -> 34361.85s]  Listen to how weird this sounds.
[34361.85s -> 34365.85s]  So this is 100 compressor and 100 de-esser.
[34365.85s -> 34368.60s]  This is like...
[34368.60s -> 34369.60s]  It just sounds so strange.
[34369.60s -> 34371.60s]  Don't I sound so weird?
[34371.60s -> 34376.70s]  I sound like a different person.
[34376.70s -> 34377.70s]  All right.
[34377.70s -> 34382.99s]  Anyways, guys, I'll see you in a couple days.
[34382.99s -> 34383.99s]  See you in...
[34383.99s -> 34386.70s]  On Wednesday.
[34386.70s -> 34387.70s]  See you soon.
[34387.70s -> 34393.14s]  I'm going to wait until it's 13 hours though.
[34393.14s -> 34394.14s]  Because...
[34394.14s -> 34395.14s]  Come on.
[34395.14s -> 34409.31s]  I got to take my victories where I can.
[34409.31s -> 34411.31s]  We want to thank you.
[34411.31s -> 34415.68s]  I just normally sound like that guy, I think.
[34415.68s -> 34420.71s]  I think I just actually sound like that, dude.
[34420.71s -> 34423.34s]  Somebody with a raid?
[34423.34s -> 34427.58s]  I mean, nobody I follow is even streaming right now.
[34427.58s -> 34435.70s]  It's so late.
[34435.70s -> 34436.70s]  Who cares?
[34436.70s -> 34437.70s]  It's got to be somebody that you follow.
[34437.70s -> 34443.38s]  It's got to be somebody that you follow.
[34443.38s -> 34444.38s]  Let's see.
[34444.38s -> 34445.38s]  Let's see.
[34445.38s -> 34446.38s]  Do you want to just pick somebody?
[34446.38s -> 34447.38s]  We could.
[34447.38s -> 34454.18s]  We should just see.
[34454.18s -> 34455.36s]  All right.
[34455.36s -> 34456.66s]  Who the fuck is streaming?
[34456.66s -> 34476.14s]  Um, um, um, um.
[34476.14s -> 34478.14s]  Raid somebody with zero viewers?
[34478.14s -> 34480.14s]  No, I don't.
[34480.14s -> 34482.14s]  That's a lot of pressure.
[34482.14s -> 34487.56s]  Some people really don't want that, I don't think.
[34487.56s -> 34490.99s]  I mean, you know what I mean?
[34490.99s -> 34497.70s]  We could, but that's a lot of people to dump on somebody.
[34497.70s -> 34499.70s]  I don't like putting that kind of pressure on somebody.
[34499.70s -> 34516.62s]  Um.
[34516.62s -> 34518.62s]  Raid my friend.
[34518.62s -> 34521.62s]  Raid my friend.
[34521.62s -> 34527.13s]  Dude, can you raid my friend?
[34527.13s -> 34529.13s]  He's live right now.
[34529.13s -> 34535.27s]  Go raid him.
[34535.27s -> 34541.78s]  I'm just scrolling down looking.
[34541.78s -> 34553.02s]  Find someone streaming a Lord of the Rings game?
[34553.02s -> 34556.50s]  Impossible.
[34556.50s -> 34564.30s]  I don't think that's possible.
[34564.30s -> 34573.29s]  Hold on.
[34573.29s -> 34575.49s]  Hold on.
[34575.49s -> 34576.49s]  Hold on.
[34576.49s -> 34577.49s]  All right.
[34577.49s -> 34578.49s]  Let's pick a game.
[34578.49s -> 34579.49s]  We'll pick a game first.
[34579.49s -> 34587.47s]  From there.
[34587.47s -> 34588.47s]  Raid the guy's friend.
