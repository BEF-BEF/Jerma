[3.26s -> 8.86s]  Hey, let's change the game to Hitman. It's worse than Quiet Man.
[11.35s -> 21.30s]  Hitman. Just for fun. Everything's just for fun. Go back to Quiet- I'm sorry, but you've-
[21.30s -> 24.26s]  We've made the lasagna. I made it for the whole company. You have to eat this.
[24.90s -> 30.06s]  Like that's like I did a poll in my company. Up in the chair.
[30.06s -> 35.77s]  What do you guys want for lunch tomorrow? And 60% of the people vote for lasagna.
[35.77s -> 42.04s]  And then all of a sudden the truck pulls up and a fucking kiddie pool lasagna comes over here.
[42.04s -> 45.32s]  And nobody eats it. Maybe two people take like- like as if you go to a birthday party
[45.32s -> 48.36s]  and somebody eats one slice of the gross cake that nobody wants.
[48.36s -> 50.44s]  No, no, no. That's not happening. That's not happening in my company.
[50.44s -> 57.24s]  You're eating this lasagna. Because you voted for it.
[57.24s -> 62.31s]  51%. Well, 51. They better be half lasagna.
[63.19s -> 65.19s]  What am I going to do with this lawless lasagna?
[65.19s -> 66.39s]  What am I supposed to do with lasagna?
[67.99s -> 70.95s]  Everybody likes lasagna. You'll eat it, right? Like you'll eat this.
[71.59s -> 79.21s]  I didn't even change- Hitman. Hitman...
[79.53s -> 82.57s]  I don't know. I think it'd be an hour to make a title.
[88.70s -> 90.76s]  Look at chat. I'm looking at chat.
[90.76s -> 92.76s]  What if you're allergic to lasagna?
[92.76s -> 96.36s]  Well, they'd be- they'd be a gluten-free fridge with a bunch of stuff in it.
[105.48s -> 106.52s]  Hitman lasagna.
[107.48s -> 112.04s]  Hitman lasagna. How do you spell lasagna?
[112.60s -> 114.82s]  I was going to spell it phonetically.
[117.32s -> 120.94s]  La-zon-ya. Lasagna.
[126.20s -> 128.12s]  That's going to be called Hitman Company lasagna.
[131.08s -> 139.98s]  There. By the way, I mean, we're not stopping right now.
[139.98s -> 141.18s]  I just want to make sure everyone's aware.
[141.74s -> 144.86s]  Tomorrow, there's no stream tomorrow because it is Thanksgiving.
[145.42s -> 146.94s]  Happy Thanksgiving if you celebrate it.
[147.74s -> 150.33s]  We're not stopping. Don't worry. We're not stopping.
[156.10s -> 157.78s]  All right. Let's eat some fucking lasagna.
[158.42s -> 162.39s]  Wait, why am I- why am I using the controller?
[162.95s -> 164.63s]  I was keyboard and mouse last time.
[166.25s -> 167.45s]  He's doing the end of the stream voice.
[167.93s -> 170.49s]  Okay. So, okay.
[171.45s -> 174.68s]  But I think, right? That's how it is.
[175.83s -> 186.95s]  Okay. So, I think I just got angry.
[186.95s -> 188.63s]  I just got fucking angry looking at this.
[189.19s -> 191.22s]  Like I have to get it off the screen.
[193.66s -> 195.58s]  All right. Let's see. What do we want to try?
[196.14s -> 203.77s]  Let's go back here and let's try a different scenario.
[206.36s -> 212.14s]  Planning. I'm not playing ghost mode.
[212.14s -> 213.42s]  Absolutely not.
[214.06s -> 215.53s]  Florida suit.
[216.25s -> 218.84s]  All right. Event. Let's try- we can go here.
[222.86s -> 225.50s]  We can take- obviously, I'm taking a fish.
[228.46s -> 230.14s]  Everyone would scream at me if I didn't.
[232.71s -> 234.47s]  All right. Stream was good. See y'all later.
[234.47s -> 236.47s]  DM me if Quiet Man comes back.
[241.88s -> 244.98s]  You just didn't take a piece of lasagna to go.
[244.98s -> 246.10s]  Don't just leave it.
[246.10s -> 254.25s]  I mean, I know I'm losing half of my viewer base here
[256.07s -> 258.23s]  because I made everybody eat lasagna.
[258.23s -> 259.43s]  Okay. Well, what if it was lasagna?
[259.43s -> 262.15s]  What if half of the lasagna was like veggie lasagna
[262.15s -> 265.91s]  and half was like a meat-based lasagna.
[265.91s -> 267.75s]  It was cut in half. It was like a giant pizza.
[267.75s -> 268.87s]  Would you eat it then?
[268.87s -> 280.23s]  Split the screen.
[280.79s -> 282.39s]  But I can't play it like that.
[294.34s -> 296.74s]  People are leaving because you keep making the lasagna.
[296.74s -> 299.30s]  Well, that's a very, very strong reference, I think.
[310.18s -> 311.46s]  All right. Well, stop learning it.
[313.85s -> 318.87s]  So we have- look, are you going to stay now?
[319.59s -> 322.20s]  I'm about to throw a briefcase at somebody.
[322.20s -> 324.68s]  Isn't that extraordinarily hilarious?
[329.80s -> 330.68s]  I'm leaving.
[331.64s -> 332.14s]  Sorry.
[333.48s -> 334.52s]  But why am I sorry?
[336.44s -> 336.76s]  All right.
[337.32s -> 340.79s]  So we got mission stories.
[341.35s -> 342.31s]  A perfect machine.
[343.19s -> 343.91s]  Intravenous.
[344.55s -> 345.27s]  We did this one.
[349.08s -> 349.96s]  The munchies.
[351.06s -> 352.02s]  The new army.
[353.00s -> 355.48s]  The triumph with turbocharged.
[356.12s -> 360.63s]  I mean, this one is so strange.
[360.63s -> 362.15s]  I need to- I kind of want to know what it is.
[363.64s -> 364.52s]  The new army.
[365.16s -> 368.22s]  So that's pretty far away.
[368.22s -> 368.78s]  Can I get in the boat?
[368.78s -> 369.66s]  Can I drive the boat?
[370.46s -> 373.66s]  I don't think I can.
[374.30s -> 376.38s]  That'd be amazing.
[376.38s -> 377.50s]  Turn off the sound.
[378.30s -> 381.78s]  What, you want the quiet man experience?
[382.58s -> 393.56s]  All right, here we go.
[395.19s -> 396.39s]  I'm not going to turn off the sound.
[396.39s -> 397.51s]  People are probably going to come here and be like,
[397.51s -> 398.55s]  oh, Hitman 2, okay.
[407.59s -> 408.39s]  Loud man.
[413.48s -> 416.52s]  No, and I'm not doing a cheese grater to my feet.
[417.96s -> 419.24s]  I'm not turning the sound off.
[419.24s -> 421.16s]  I'm not putting a cheese grater on my feet.
[421.16s -> 422.68s]  And I'm not going to turn the sound as loud as I-
[422.68s -> 424.12s]  I'm going to do the Hitman mission.
[431.61s -> 433.77s]  That is Ted Mendez.
[433.77s -> 436.97s]  One of the country's most influential military grade moneymen.
[437.53s -> 439.37s]  This must be connected to Kronstadt.
[440.17s -> 441.87s]  Okay.
[442.49s -> 444.81s]  Let's see if we can listen to what this guy said.
[444.81s -> 445.53s]  Look, dolphins.
[446.57s -> 457.40s]  Ted here.
[457.40s -> 460.20s]  Just returning your call before heading over to the expo building
[460.20s -> 461.72s]  to meet Knox with a new-
[461.72s -> 465.32s]  Combat Android presentation.
[465.32s -> 465.82s]  Okay.
[466.76s -> 468.52s]  Yeah, the stutter is kind of crazy.
[469.40s -> 469.80s]  Why?
[469.80s -> 470.84s]  It's because there's water.
[471.72s -> 481.11s]  I don't have a 780.
[481.11s -> 481.83s]  I have a 1080.
[482.55s -> 486.28s]  I mean, my drivers might be from like 2016,
[486.28s -> 488.04s]  but it's still a 1080, god damn it.
[488.92s -> 489.40s]  I'm kidding.
[489.40s -> 489.88s]  That's a joke.
[490.52s -> 491.40s]  I have the drivers.
[493.91s -> 494.95s]  Ted Mendez.
[494.95s -> 497.83s]  A defense funding consultant with the U.S. military
[497.83s -> 499.83s]  is scheduled for a private demonstration
[499.83s -> 501.83s]  of a new Kronstadt robotics project.
[501.83s -> 502.33s]  Okay.
[502.39s -> 505.19s]  Sounds like a way to get up close and personal with what-
[506.39s -> 507.43s]  Update drivers.
[508.47s -> 511.37s]  Disguise yourself as Ted Mendez.
[511.37s -> 511.87s]  You got it.
[514.84s -> 515.34s]  Hey.
[519.39s -> 521.39s]  My 10- my 970 runs again.
[521.39s -> 522.67s]  Do I need to get drivers?
[523.55s -> 527.55s]  Maybe I should update my drivers on stream.
[527.55s -> 533.98s]  Is this guy gonna see this?
[553.63s -> 554.59s]  I can't get him now.
[554.59s -> 555.55s]  There's a guy behind me.
[559.42s -> 560.54s]  Why is this running so-
[560.54s -> 561.90s]  This wasn't running like this before.
[562.78s -> 564.38s]  I have to get the fucking new drivers.
[585.00s -> 586.68s]  I have to make these guys run the other direction.
[587.40s -> 588.52s]  I did not turn the settings down?
[588.52s -> 589.24s]  Yeah, I don't know why.
[590.20s -> 592.04s]  I think it's definitely a driver problem.
[592.84s -> 609.05s]  Quick dump in the water.
[609.05s -> 610.17s]  Water, water, water, water, water.
[614.65s -> 615.29s]  Oh, fuck.
[615.85s -> 635.10s]  Turn the water off.
[640.54s -> 641.66s]  I dislike this stream.
[641.66s -> 642.86s]  It's not quiet, man.
[643.58s -> 648.54s]  Okay.
[649.84s -> 652.24s]  Save it and get indoors before my computer breaks.
[658.72s -> 659.22s]  Hitman.
[660.22s -> 660.78s]  It's time.
[663.24s -> 663.72s]  I have nothing.
[663.72s -> 664.52s]  I don't know what to say.
[669.76s -> 670.56s]  Approach to reception.
[670.56s -> 670.88s]  Here we go.
[670.88s -> 672.24s]  We're gonna do this fun mission.
[672.24s -> 673.28s]  Mr. Mendez.
[673.28s -> 674.72s]  Good to see you, sir.
[674.72s -> 677.92s]  The demonstration is scheduled to take place on the upper floors.
[678.00s -> 679.12s]  Look at the executive floor.
[679.12s -> 680.80s]  Please feel free to use the stairs right over there.
[680.80s -> 682.56s]  He finally ran out of jokes.
[683.98s -> 684.46s]  Excuse me.
[684.46s -> 685.42s]  Oh, I got so many.
[685.42s -> 686.86s]  Can you tell me where to go, please?
[686.86s -> 688.46s]  It's just up these stairs.
[688.46s -> 689.42s]  It's just some of the-
[689.42s -> 690.78s]  I run a joke library up there,
[690.78s -> 691.90s]  and a lot of the books are overdue,
[691.90s -> 693.42s]  so I'm just kind of waiting for them to be returned.
[697.08s -> 699.48s]  This is running like dog shit.
[699.48s -> 700.52s]  It wasn't doing this before.
[713.63s -> 714.03s]  Hold on.
[714.03s -> 715.79s]  Let me just go get the driver.
[715.79s -> 717.88s]  I'm gonna open Quiet Man up in the background
[717.88s -> 718.84s]  while we get the driver.
[718.84s -> 724.09s]  I don't know why it's doing this.
[724.33s -> 725.61s]  It's like unplayable, actually.
[725.61s -> 727.13s]  I don't know why it's doing it now.
[727.13s -> 732.08s]  Oh, I'll get it quick.
[732.08s -> 735.96s]  I have 10,000 down.
[735.96s -> 736.60s]  Oh, fuck.
[736.60s -> 738.12s]  Wait, will this turn off the stream?
[739.23s -> 739.95s]  It shouldn't, right?
[746.01s -> 747.29s]  No, is this gonna turn off the stream?
[754.12s -> 755.40s]  All right, I'll be right back if it does.
[757.39s -> 759.36s]  This one just came out.
[760.40s -> 762.00s]  Optimize for Hitman.
[762.00s -> 763.20s]  It actually is.
[763.20s -> 763.76s]  It actually is.
[763.76s -> 767.04s]  This one that came out like a week ago.
[767.04s -> 767.76s]  All right, let's get it.
[768.32s -> 769.44s]  Oh, hopefully it's the right one.
[770.81s -> 771.77s]  Turn the face cam on.
[771.77s -> 772.89s]  I don't have a webcam.
[774.16s -> 776.00s]  I don't have a webcam plugged in.
[776.00s -> 779.39s]  That's all right.
[779.39s -> 780.75s]  It's already done downloading.
[780.75s -> 781.71s]  I'm ready.
[781.71s -> 785.58s]  That's okay.
[785.58s -> 793.34s]  I have 10,000 to plug in a webcam.
[795.90s -> 796.30s]  Lies.
[797.10s -> 799.02s]  All right, I hope this doesn't turn off OBS.
[799.02s -> 800.78s]  If not, I'm gonna press the button and come right back.
[800.78s -> 802.54s]  But I cannot play like that.
[802.54s -> 803.66s]  It's just, it's not gonna happen.
[806.22s -> 806.70s]  Here we go.
[808.46s -> 809.90s]  Yes, I'd like to install the drivers.
[810.46s -> 818.68s]  Hey, let's put this up.
[818.68s -> 819.08s]  There we go.
[819.08s -> 819.96s]  Look, I'll be right back.
[822.14s -> 823.26s]  That was a virus noise?
[823.26s -> 823.82s]  No, it wasn't.
[823.82s -> 825.82s]  That was a weird installing noise.
[826.86s -> 828.46s]  Don't install the GeForce Experience.
[828.46s -> 828.78s]  I don't.
[828.78s -> 830.86s]  I just get the driver and I say, no, thank you.
[834.46s -> 835.50s]  All right, 55%.
[840.91s -> 841.47s]  75%.
[845.10s -> 847.74s]  Guys, I mean, this just proves that everyone says,
[847.74s -> 849.42s]  upgrade your PC, upgrade your PC.
[849.42s -> 855.98s]  I mean, I have a dual core Celeron processor from like 2008 or 2007.
[855.98s -> 858.06s]  So it's still good and it still works perfectly fine.
[867.05s -> 868.65s]  Checking system compatibility.
[868.65s -> 870.01s]  I said it's compatible.
[870.01s -> 872.17s]  Just get it so I don't have to deal with the Hitman issue.
[876.81s -> 877.37s]  Come on.
[877.37s -> 878.57s]  I got hungry people here.
[878.57s -> 881.74s]  I got hungry customers here.
[881.74s -> 885.63s]  I just went in the back and I'm out of pizza.
[885.63s -> 887.48s]  There's no more pizza dough ready.
[887.48s -> 889.48s]  And there's like a line of people waiting for the pizza.
[889.48s -> 892.68s]  And I'm the guy, I'm the manager, running in the fucking back going like,
[892.68s -> 893.88s]  where are the fucking pizzas?
[894.52s -> 900.81s]  Hurry.
[900.81s -> 903.45s]  I'm still testing my system compatibility.
[904.25s -> 908.01s]  Roll the dough out, get it in the oven, and fucking put toppings on it now.
[910.28s -> 913.66s]  Got it.
[913.66s -> 914.54s]  All right, here it comes.
[915.74s -> 916.46s]  I'll be right back.
[916.46s -> 918.70s]  If this stream turns off, I'll be back in two seconds.
[923.79s -> 925.95s]  49% of the restaurants want pasta.
[925.95s -> 926.67s]  Well, that's all right.
[929.02s -> 933.74s]  We'll just, we'll just, there'll be a station to the left of the pizzas
[933.74s -> 937.82s]  where you can put the fucking pizza into a blender and then it pisses out pasta.
[938.46s -> 939.48s]  I don't know, guys.
[939.48s -> 940.84s]  I'm trying to install a driver.
[940.84s -> 942.44s]  I'm trying to.
[942.44s -> 943.32s]  I don't know.
[943.32s -> 948.94s]  I don't know.
[948.94s -> 950.86s]  My stream's gonna like turn off.
[950.86s -> 952.14s]  Fucking quiet, man.
[952.14s -> 967.16s]  The pizza shop is currently on fire.
[967.16s -> 968.28s]  No, we're good.
[968.28s -> 969.32s]  Then we're gonna, we're gonna get back into it.
[969.32s -> 970.20s]  We're gonna be just fine.
[971.00s -> 976.84s]  But correct me if I'm wrong, but the last Hitman stream I did,
[976.84s -> 978.12s]  it was not like that, right?
[980.30s -> 983.02s]  It happened every so often, but it wasn't a constant issue.
[983.66s -> 991.24s]  All right, we're going.
[991.24s -> 991.72s]  We're going.
[991.72s -> 992.12s]  It's going.
[992.84s -> 995.68s]  How do I like, I need to like turn on a webcam.
[996.40s -> 999.08s]  Do I have any webcams up here that I just plug in?
[1000.20s -> 1005.80s]  How do I, I dare, I, hold on.
[1005.80s -> 1008.59s]  All right, here's a shitty webcam that I'm gonna plug in.
[1009.31s -> 1016.94s]  Is this gonna, am I live?
[1017.74s -> 1019.18s]  My whole computer is flashing.
[1019.82s -> 1021.10s]  I think we're live still, are we?
[1021.90s -> 1025.10s]  But my display just got darker.
[1025.10s -> 1031.96s]  Are we, we're not live anymore?
[1037.52s -> 1039.44s]  Why can I not, my other monitors are off.
[1051.71s -> 1062.36s]  Oh god, curse of the quiet, man.
[1063.08s -> 1065.05s]  All right, it's done.
[1065.05s -> 1066.97s]  It's pretty much, it's just finishing up.
[1071.93s -> 1073.85s]  Even your PC wants to play quiet, man.
[1074.49s -> 1078.20s]  All right, to complete installation, restart the computer.
[1078.20s -> 1079.72s]  No, restart later.
[1079.72s -> 1083.61s]  I don't have time for this shit.
[1083.61s -> 1086.27s]  I don't have time for this shit.
[1086.27s -> 1087.55s]  All right, display.
[1087.55s -> 1090.99s]  Where's, what the fuck?
[1093.84s -> 1096.32s]  Don't, I don't, it doesn't detect any other displays.
[1096.96s -> 1100.00s]  Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[1107.40s -> 1110.11s]  Well, encoding overload.
[1110.11s -> 1114.11s]  Consider turning down the video settings is what OBS just said.
[1118.27s -> 1120.51s]  I'm at a 90% CPU right now.
[1121.07s -> 1123.32s]  I gotta get out of here.
[1123.32s -> 1123.88s]  I'll be right back.
[1123.88s -> 1124.84s]  I gotta go.
[1124.84s -> 1125.85s]  I actually have to go.
[1125.85s -> 1126.97s]  I'm at 90% CPU.
[1126.97s -> 1129.84s]  I'll be right back.
[1129.84s -> 1131.12s]  All right, let's try it.
[1131.12s -> 1135.72s]  Let's see what happens.
[1136.28s -> 1145.68s]  This reminds me of my favorite game, The Quiet Man.
[1145.68s -> 1147.76s]  If I just stayed in The Quiet Man, none of this would have happened.
[1162.56s -> 1163.68s]  I'm back, I'm back.
[1163.68s -> 1164.40s]  I'm coming back.
[1167.44s -> 1168.48s]  Can't argue with that.
[1171.15s -> 1171.71s]  Here we go.
[1172.35s -> 1174.51s]  Count backwards.
[1175.23s -> 1178.88s]  All right, get that off the screen.
[1182.65s -> 1183.61s]  Let's see if it fixed it.
[1184.68s -> 1185.48s]  I can see chat.
[1185.48s -> 1186.52s]  I've restarted.
[1187.16s -> 1189.24s]  I got my, I got all my shit ready.
[1189.24s -> 1189.88s]  I'm ready to go.
[1190.60s -> 1196.30s]  Let's just load where we just were.
[1196.30s -> 1199.98s]  And hopefully I don't, I don't run it like nine frames per second.
[1200.62s -> 1210.40s]  Why, The Quiet Man's currently trying to get captured.
[1212.20s -> 1213.48s]  Hey, hi guy.
[1213.48s -> 1215.32s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[1216.04s -> 1221.16s]  Jesus Christ.
[1228.32s -> 1231.04s]  Oh, hey, hey, hey everybody.
[1231.04s -> 1231.60s]  How are you?
[1231.60s -> 1238.30s]  Hey, how do I get that load game?
[1238.30s -> 1249.87s]  Quit game, load game.
[1250.43s -> 1260.81s]  We've pushed him too hard.
[1262.68s -> 1265.56s]  No, I just want a better menu than Xbox One.
[1266.92s -> 1268.92s]  Like I just want to load my game.
[1268.92s -> 1296.32s]  I don't have to buy my, okay, whatever.
[1296.32s -> 1297.12s]  I'm just going to load this.
[1297.84s -> 1307.92s]  It's under featured.
[1310.70s -> 1313.50s]  The one tab, it should be on the fucking first page.
[1319.42s -> 1325.10s]  It's like in Windows 8.
[1325.10s -> 1326.06s]  It is the first page.
[1326.06s -> 1327.74s]  But it should be on the second page too.
[1327.74s -> 1329.68s]  Load.
[1329.68s -> 1330.88s]  Okay, God.
[1331.61s -> 1332.41s]  Go, start it.
[1332.41s -> 1334.17s]  Hey, welcome to the stream everybody.
[1334.17s -> 1340.57s]  I was playing The Quiet Man.
[1340.57s -> 1342.01s]  We were making lasagna references.
[1342.01s -> 1344.57s]  And now I'm angry playing Hitman 2.
[1344.57s -> 1347.85s]  What the fuck is going on?
[1347.85s -> 1350.33s]  The race is entering its final lap, 47.
[1351.48s -> 1353.16s]  47, the race is over.
[1353.72s -> 1356.52s]  Sierra will be coming off the track anytime now.
[1356.52s -> 1357.48s]  It fixed it.
[1357.48s -> 1358.36s]  It actually fixed it.
[1361.28s -> 1361.92s]  We're good.
[1361.92s -> 1363.04s]  Game is fixed.
[1369.56s -> 1370.20s]  All right.
[1370.20s -> 1371.00s]  Let's settle down.
[1371.56s -> 1373.64s]  Everyone just relax.
[1377.66s -> 1378.16s]  Okay.
[1385.34s -> 1386.78s]  By the way, the mission was on a timer.
[1390.24s -> 1391.04s]  It's not on a timer.
[1391.04s -> 1391.52s]  We're fine.
[1391.52s -> 1392.08s]  Everything's fine.
[1392.08s -> 1392.72s]  Everything's good to go.
[1392.72s -> 1393.76s]  Let's play Hitman 2.
[1395.12s -> 1401.24s]  Am I allowed up here?
[1401.24s -> 1402.60s]  Okay, go to the executive floor.
[1405.93s -> 1406.57s]  I'm lagging though.
[1406.57s -> 1407.05s]  I shouldn't be.
[1407.61s -> 1412.01s]  I shouldn't be lagging.
[1417.84s -> 1418.64s]  Not fixed.
[1423.63s -> 1424.11s]  Turn off this.
[1425.07s -> 1427.55s]  Are we witnessing like the death of my graphics card live?
[1428.43s -> 1431.15s]  Did playing The Quiet Man like break my computer actually?
[1443.39s -> 1450.01s]  Check OBS.
[1450.01s -> 1451.37s]  OBS looks okay right now.
[1457.16s -> 1458.12s]  Go back to quiet.
[1459.72s -> 1461.00s]  Live exercise in progress.
[1461.00s -> 1461.24s]  All right.
[1461.24s -> 1461.72s]  I'm gonna be careful.
[1461.72s -> 1462.12s]  Let's save it.
[1464.51s -> 1465.71s]  I am getting like OBS.
[1466.51s -> 1467.87s]  I streamed this in taught.
[1467.87s -> 1469.31s]  This is what annoys me the most.
[1470.19s -> 1472.51s]  I streamed this entire game.
[1473.15s -> 1474.19s]  The whole thing.
[1474.19s -> 1474.67s]  Every mission.
[1476.27s -> 1477.95s]  Without any like encoding issues.
[1477.95s -> 1479.15s]  And I didn't change any settings.
[1479.15s -> 1480.27s]  So what the fuck is going on?
[1486.27s -> 1487.39s]  Save scum.
[1487.39s -> 1496.40s]  You have to finish Quiet Man.
[1496.40s -> 1498.48s]  I'm gonna say something provocative now, Ted.
[1499.20s -> 1500.96s]  War is going out of fashion.
[1501.60s -> 1502.24s]  It's dirty.
[1502.24s -> 1504.32s]  It's just plain bad PR.
[1504.32s -> 1510.16s]  Nobody wants to exchange their children and loved ones for flags and medals anymore.
[1510.24s -> 1512.40s]  The glory is cursed, Ted.
[1512.40s -> 1517.28s]  But luckily, Kronstadt has a solution for that.
[1517.28s -> 1518.08s]  Imagine this.
[1518.80s -> 1521.84s]  Android infiltrators operating in the field.
[1521.84s -> 1526.16s]  Disguised, fully embedded, ready to strike at a moment's notice.
[1526.80s -> 1533.28s]  Indestructible robotic operators who can infiltrate the deepest sanctuary of any adversary.
[1534.40s -> 1537.12s]  Quiet Man's not still running in the background.
[1537.12s -> 1540.03s]  A surgical tool.
[1540.99s -> 1542.11s]  An army of them.
[1542.75s -> 1545.07s]  Fully equipped Android medics.
[1545.63s -> 1548.67s]  Seeking out wounded servicemen and injured civilians.
[1549.23s -> 1550.83s]  Bringing them to safety.
[1550.83s -> 1553.07s]  Or patching them up dead in there.
[1553.07s -> 1558.11s]  Android pilots delivering payloads deep inside enemy territory.
[1558.11s -> 1560.35s]  So picture of target dummy.
[1560.35s -> 1562.19s]  And minimal collateral damage.
[1562.83s -> 1563.71s]  All right, Mendez.
[1563.71s -> 1565.15s]  It's very straightforward.
[1565.15s -> 1566.19s]  Let me show you.
[1566.19s -> 1567.55s]  So I have to sabotage this thing.
[1567.55s -> 1568.83s]  Any of the pictures on the desk.
[1568.91s -> 1572.03s]  Then I use the scanner to upload the biometric data.
[1572.03s -> 1573.39s]  And Pallas will do the rest.
[1573.39s -> 1574.19s]  Target acquired.
[1574.19s -> 1575.42s]  WB.
[1575.42s -> 1576.70s]  So this thing is shooting.
[1576.70s -> 1577.20s]  Okay.
[1578.88s -> 1581.04s]  So how am I going to turn this thing around and have it shoot everybody?
[1581.04s -> 1582.80s]  Annually feeding it biometric data.
[1582.80s -> 1584.48s]  This is still a prototype.
[1584.48s -> 1585.84s]  This is a pivotal moment.
[1585.84s -> 1587.52s]  No, there's no way it's still running.
[1587.52s -> 1588.64s]  I restarted my computer.
[1588.64s -> 1589.44s]  I had to turn the stream on.
[1589.44s -> 1591.44s]  Pallas is entirely full crew.
[1591.44s -> 1592.48s]  There ain't anything else running.
[1592.48s -> 1593.60s]  Is the pic a photo?
[1593.60s -> 1594.72s]  What's the holdup, Mendez?
[1596.72s -> 1601.39s]  Picture of target dummy.
[1601.39s -> 1602.27s]  Picture of target.
[1602.27s -> 1602.99s]  I need a picture.
[1602.99s -> 1603.87s]  I need a picture of you.
[1604.83s -> 1607.58s]  So I need to get a picture of him first.
[1608.70s -> 1610.14s]  I may have missed my opportunity here.
[1610.86s -> 1611.55s]  All right.
[1611.55s -> 1612.43s]  Target dummy C.
[1613.31s -> 1616.08s]  Let's do them all at the same time.
[1635.63s -> 1636.99s]  There's no way it's running in the background.
[1636.99s -> 1637.79s]  I know.
[1637.79s -> 1641.56s]  I just think how much more we can accomplish together.
[1641.56s -> 1643.16s]  My brain's your money.
[1643.80s -> 1645.72s]  The sky's the limit here, my friend.
[1646.76s -> 1647.32s]  I don't know.
[1648.04s -> 1649.56s]  Maybe I'm old fashioned.
[1649.64s -> 1651.48s]  I still prefer the human touch.
[1651.48s -> 1653.48s]  You're part of an old institution.
[1655.40s -> 1658.92s]  If this is running in the background, there's no fucking way.
[1665.76s -> 1666.24s]  Hold on.
[1666.24s -> 1666.88s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[1669.52s -> 1669.92s]  Five?
[1673.05s -> 1674.96s]  No, no, no, no.
[1674.96s -> 1676.88s]  I've restarted the computer.
[1676.88s -> 1677.68s]  No, there's no way.
[1680.14s -> 1682.30s]  No.
[1682.30s -> 1684.38s]  And you prefer the traditional approach.
[1684.38s -> 1685.50s]  I respect that.
[1685.50s -> 1686.70s]  It is like running like shit.
[1686.70s -> 1687.66s]  What happened to my computer?
[1687.66s -> 1689.50s]  This is the future you're looking at.
[1689.50s -> 1693.42s]  Autonomous synthetic systems will entirely remove human agents.
[1693.42s -> 1694.54s]  What does five mean?
[1695.82s -> 1702.28s]  I guarantee this thing will absolutely murder anything you put it up against.
[1702.28s -> 1703.56s]  Sounds promising.
[1703.56s -> 1705.56s]  So, Mr. Mendez, impressive so far?
[1705.56s -> 1706.36s]  It is pretty impressive.
[1706.36s -> 1707.72s]  So let me find a picture of you and shoot you.
[1707.72s -> 1710.12s]  Let me show you our on-site robotics lab.
[1710.12s -> 1712.04s]  It's small, but state of the art.
[1712.04s -> 1712.76s]  And it's fully mobile.
[1712.76s -> 1714.60s]  Don't hit a new PC in the meeting room.
[1718.99s -> 1719.71s]  Check HW.
[1719.71s -> 1720.91s]  No, I can see my CPU.
[1721.71s -> 1723.42s]  I have no idea.
[1723.42s -> 1728.62s]  So as part of the deal, Cronstadt will throw in one deployment cell per five.
[1728.62s -> 1731.50s]  I haven't been able to lock in and pay attention.
[1731.50s -> 1733.02s]  I really should just go back and play quiet, man.
[1734.22s -> 1742.33s]  Are you, sir?
[1743.93s -> 1746.41s]  Yeah, my computer is fucked up.
[1747.05s -> 1750.67s]  My CPU is being overloaded right now.
[1755.07s -> 1756.75s]  I have no answer for this.
[1757.47s -> 1762.80s]  My CPU is being overloaded now.
[1772.11s -> 1773.47s]  I need a computer doctor.
[1774.11s -> 1785.02s]  Check OBS to see if it's using CPU or GPU encoding.
[1785.02s -> 1786.94s]  The driver update probably caused it to get switched.
[1791.20s -> 1792.96s]  I was just playing.
[1792.96s -> 1794.08s]  I was just playing.
[1796.03s -> 1797.07s]  The quiet fan.
[1803.48s -> 1804.68s]  No, no, everything's fine.
[1812.28s -> 1813.00s]  No, it looks fine.
[1813.56s -> 1819.66s]  Maybe something to be...
[1819.66s -> 1822.30s]  No, I played in this exact mission.
[1823.34s -> 1826.22s]  I was in the same exact spot not even a week ago.
[1826.22s -> 1827.58s]  And this wasn't happening.
[1827.58s -> 1832.01s]  It's unfortunate that this is kind of taking over the stream right now.
[1833.55s -> 1834.27s]  This is bad.
[1835.07s -> 1836.24s]  This is real bad.
[1846.33s -> 1846.83s]  Fuck.
[1847.93s -> 1855.69s]  Yeah, it's on H.264.
[1855.69s -> 1856.33s]  I just looked.
[1861.64s -> 1862.20s]  It is...
[1866.40s -> 1866.80s]  I can't...
[1867.52s -> 1871.50s]  Oh, no, I'm just sad.
[1872.22s -> 1883.55s]  The stream is a mess leaving.
[1883.55s -> 1884.03s]  I'm sorry.
[1884.59s -> 1888.75s]  I did not expect my CPU to overload and overheat and get all fucked up.
[1892.84s -> 1894.04s]  It was kind of funny at first.
[1894.04s -> 1895.72s]  No, I'm actually just kind of sad about it.
[1898.89s -> 1899.69s]  I'm going to reload here.
[1900.25s -> 1908.89s]  I'm going to change this.
[1909.69s -> 1915.68s]  Clean out the dust.
[1915.68s -> 1917.68s]  The inside is pristine.
[1917.68s -> 1919.04s]  There's no dust in there at all.
[1928.14s -> 1929.50s]  I'm not going to go back a little further.
[1930.30s -> 1931.82s]  Oh, I'm so defeated right now.
[1931.82s -> 1935.18s]  Because Italics just had major computer problems.
[1935.18s -> 1938.30s]  Italics's computer was smoking and almost lit on fire.
[1939.26s -> 1943.66s]  And now my CPU is fucking going crazy.
[1944.46s -> 1944.96s]  Huh?
[1945.50s -> 1946.00s]  Why?
[1947.10s -> 1948.06s]  Why are we cursed?
[1956.59s -> 1959.53s]  No, I'm going to go back here.
[1960.25s -> 1964.99s]  I'm going to go to...
[1964.99s -> 1970.27s]  Because I'm sorry I wasn't able to completely engross myself and pay attention to that.
[1970.35s -> 1973.15s]  My mind's been somewhere else, as you are very well aware.
[1973.15s -> 1973.65s]  So let's...
[1980.17s -> 1981.53s]  I'm going to do like this one.
[1984.08s -> 1988.88s]  I need to get like a picture of him, but I just didn't do it, unfortunately.
[1999.04s -> 1999.60s]  Hold on.
[1999.60s -> 2000.64s]  I'm going to find a photo.
[2004.67s -> 2006.19s]  Yeah, I'm sorry, everybody.
[2006.75s -> 2010.59s]  I'm sorry that technical problems have taken the stream over once again.
[2020.35s -> 2021.71s]  Picture of him in here?
[2021.71s -> 2022.91s]  Is there a photo of him in here?
[2027.07s -> 2027.63s]  Okay, I can do it.
[2033.71s -> 2034.99s]  Now I have to go back to quiet.
[2035.95s -> 2038.86s]  All right, where's that demonstration?
[2039.50s -> 2042.76s]  Right here.
[2042.76s -> 2047.68s]  All right, I'm back.
[2047.68s -> 2048.64s]  And I have something for you.
[2050.56s -> 2051.68s]  Go stand over there, buddy.
[2065.93s -> 2067.13s]  All right, here we go.
[2067.13s -> 2067.69s]  I'm going to get him.
[2074.33s -> 2076.09s]  This isn't less lagging than it was last time?
[2077.29s -> 2080.73s]  Yeah, but last time I was not getting encoding errors,
[2080.73s -> 2082.65s]  because I can look at my CPU right now.
[2083.85s -> 2086.17s]  It's going way harder than it was last time.
[2090.01s -> 2098.25s]  Yeah, this is all turned off and down and everything.
[2098.25s -> 2098.81s]  It's not this.
[2102.88s -> 2104.48s]  Yeah, task manager is there's nothing there.
[2106.88s -> 2107.76s]  Turn V-Sync off.
[2109.23s -> 2110.11s]  It was already.
[2110.11s -> 2110.91s]  Was it off before?
[2114.72s -> 2115.76s]  That like made it worse.
[2117.76s -> 2118.16s]  Bet three.
[2118.16s -> 2119.36s]  Thanks for the five community subs.
[2127.92s -> 2128.96s]  Switch to the other controller.
[2128.96s -> 2130.24s]  Well, I have to turn the stream off again.
[2133.60s -> 2136.08s]  I really don't want to like troubleshoot live here
[2136.08s -> 2138.80s]  and like, oh, I'm going to turn the stream off back on streams off back on.
[2138.80s -> 2140.00s]  I'll just deal with it for now.
[2140.00s -> 2141.44s]  It's very straightforward.
[2141.44s -> 2142.08s]  Let me show you.
[2142.64s -> 2144.64s]  I just pick any of the pictures on the desk.
[2145.44s -> 2148.32s]  I think we're going to scan it to upload the biometric data
[2148.32s -> 2149.68s]  and Palace will be the rest.
[2151.52s -> 2158.52s]  Obviously, the final system won't rely on you manually feeding it.
[2158.52s -> 2160.04s]  Unplug my webcam.
[2162.64s -> 2164.96s]  No, it's not that still a prototype.
[2164.96s -> 2167.60s]  This is a pivotal moment in modern.
[2168.48s -> 2171.04s]  Yeah, Palace is entirely.
[2172.00s -> 2174.00s]  All you need is to pick a photo.
[2174.00s -> 2175.04s]  But what's the hold up?
[2175.04s -> 2177.04s]  Mendez just scan one of the pictures.
[2177.92s -> 2178.96s]  All right, let's do it.
[2178.96s -> 2180.00s]  Hey, look, I have a picture here.
[2180.64s -> 2186.16s]  I wonder whose picture this is photo of Robert Knox.
[2192.30s -> 2197.29s]  Knox down now for the it's that easy.
[2202.09s -> 2205.47s]  I mean, I press the button.
[2205.47s -> 2206.83s]  Wouldn't they come over to me and be like, hey,
[2206.83s -> 2216.99s]  what the hell did you just do anything to do with this?
[2217.71s -> 2218.99s]  Yeah, you, Mr.
[2222.03s -> 2222.75s]  Oh, come on.
[2222.75s -> 2224.43s]  He's not hold on.
[2224.43s -> 2226.35s]  Wait, I stayed here for too long.
[2227.82s -> 2228.22s]  Really?
[2228.22s -> 2228.54s]  Okay.
[2231.47s -> 2234.40s]  Did I actually just get caught?
[2235.12s -> 2238.83s]  I was thinking that guy's going to get shot in the back of the head.
[2245.31s -> 2247.07s]  There's new settings in the game.
[2248.41s -> 2249.13s]  Really?
[2249.13s -> 2257.36s]  I mean, I don't see anything that's different from last time.
[2257.36s -> 2266.59s]  I don't see anything different.
[2266.59s -> 2268.41s]  It's running better now.
[2269.21s -> 2269.61s]  We'll see.
[2269.61s -> 2270.17s]  We'll deal with it.
[2271.05s -> 2271.55s]  We.
[2274.94s -> 2277.36s]  It was doing that before, but not as hard as that.
[2280.41s -> 2282.09s]  A new option that I can't change.
[2283.13s -> 2286.46s]  All right, let's do let's get rid of the do another mission.
[2290.52s -> 2293.96s]  So this is I can't do this one now, but maybe I can do this one intravenous.
[2297.69s -> 2299.05s]  Do the quiet man mission.
[2299.77s -> 2303.02s]  Failing hard drive.
[2303.58s -> 2305.26s]  I don't know.
[2308.94s -> 2309.42s]  I do.
[2309.42s -> 2310.06s]  I brought a fish.
[2310.06s -> 2311.42s]  I didn't even bring my actual tools.
[2312.06s -> 2322.88s]  I hope German doesn't get upset from streams like these.
[2322.88s -> 2323.28s]  I do.
[2324.40s -> 2324.88s]  I do.
[2324.88s -> 2326.80s]  But not at like anyone in particular, right?
[2329.44s -> 2334.65s]  It's not like I'm angry with you guys or anything.
[2334.65s -> 2335.69s]  Like I can't believe this.
[2335.69s -> 2337.66s]  How do I get that?
[2337.66s -> 2338.94s]  Just that kind of sucks.
[2338.94s -> 2342.24s]  You know, Hey, what's up?
[2342.24s -> 2343.20s]  It's having fun.
[2343.20s -> 2346.40s]  And now I have to like live troubleshoot computer problem.
[2346.40s -> 2347.84s]  Why is there like a dinosaur over here?
[2349.36s -> 2353.98s]  No, I'm good.
[2353.98s -> 2354.30s]  I'm good.
[2354.94s -> 2357.80s]  Where's the T Rex?
[2359.66s -> 2360.38s]  Is this lady?
[2361.10s -> 2363.24s]  Holy shit.
[2363.24s -> 2364.92s]  You weigh like 5000 pounds.
[2369.56s -> 2371.56s]  The record I voted for quiet, man.
[2373.42s -> 2375.26s]  Yeah, but I would have run into it eventually.
[2375.90s -> 2378.30s]  So better now than ever, you know what I mean?
[2378.30s -> 2379.26s]  Better now than never.
[2382.22s -> 2383.98s]  Hey, how'd you know I'm bald?
[2383.98s -> 2392.24s]  Can I go through here?
[2396.38s -> 2399.28s]  I'm allowed to go through this way, but let's see.
[2399.84s -> 2404.01s]  I probably should put his outfit on.
[2404.01s -> 2417.12s]  Can you be around better off than on?
[2417.76s -> 2420.17s]  No, you have a key.
[2420.97s -> 2422.36s]  Wait, you got a key on you.
[2424.24s -> 2425.28s]  You have a gun, but you don't.
[2425.28s -> 2426.00s]  I'm gonna give a key.
[2426.72s -> 2433.66s]  All right, come with me.
[2435.34s -> 2438.14s]  That should at least give me access to this next part.
[2443.68s -> 2445.04s]  Better quiet than hit, man.
[2445.60s -> 2449.15s]  Yay.
[2452.73s -> 2454.41s]  Ghost mode has more optimization.
[2455.50s -> 2456.62s]  You know, and I'm sure it does.
[2465.72s -> 2467.64s]  I should have a broken neck counter.
[2470.16s -> 2472.16s]  Ooh, I'm going to bring him over here.
[2472.88s -> 2473.36s]  I can't.
[2473.36s -> 2473.84s]  He's fine.
[2474.48s -> 2475.44s]  No one's going to give a shit.
[2478.06s -> 2478.62s]  Why can I not?
[2480.27s -> 2481.07s]  Why was I grayed out?
[2481.71s -> 2487.58s]  All right, open this from the inside so I can run out there if I need to.
[2492.64s -> 2493.44s]  Hornets are back.
[2498.64s -> 2499.28s]  I've been great.
[2500.00s -> 2516.60s]  Can I get in front of the camera?
[2517.48s -> 2529.92s]  That's a nice camera.
[2529.92s -> 2531.36s]  Sir, can you please get out of there?
[2539.40s -> 2540.12s]  Body found?
[2540.12s -> 2541.08s]  Who found that body?
[2542.06s -> 2542.86s]  I'm trespassing.
[2542.86s -> 2543.42s]  I'm trespassing.
[2543.42s -> 2544.30s]  I'm trespassing here.
[2545.10s -> 2546.14s]  I'm supposed to be security.
[2546.14s -> 2547.98s]  What, mall security is not allowed back here?
[2563.96s -> 2565.00s]  We might have a situation.
[2565.64s -> 2566.60s]  Someone just got an ad.
[2566.60s -> 2567.48s]  All right, let's fish this guy.
[2569.00s -> 2569.40s]  How are you?
[2571.29s -> 2571.79s]  What?
[2575.61s -> 2580.17s]  I just beat the shit out of this guy.
[2580.17s -> 2580.97s]  And he got right back up.
[2581.77s -> 2583.44s]  All right, I need a place to dump him.
[2584.00s -> 2588.22s]  This way.
[2588.94s -> 2589.50s]  Come with me.
[2599.02s -> 2600.94s]  Quiet Man versus Sneak Man.
[2611.84s -> 2613.12s]  Quiet Man doesn't kill.
[2613.12s -> 2615.12s]  What, you're assuming I didn't kill all those guys?
[2624.88s -> 2626.64s]  All right, so I need to go that way.
[2626.64s -> 2627.12s]  In there.
[2631.04s -> 2632.08s]  All right, bye.
[2632.08s -> 2634.17s]  All right, here we go.
[2634.17s -> 2635.53s]  Medical tent.
[2636.65s -> 2638.09s]  Story revealing itself.
[2638.81s -> 2643.95s]  Let's just say she's got a bad case of intermittent explosive disorder.
[2647.95s -> 2649.95s]  She's got intermittent explosive diarrhea.
[2651.31s -> 2655.23s]  Now he has to deal with this guy suffering from urinary retention.
[2656.35s -> 2657.55s]  Not his day.
[2657.55s -> 2662.67s]  Let's just hope he doesn't somehow screw up the revitalization procedure on Ms. Knox.
[2662.67s -> 2665.05s]  No, it's just a simple injection.
[2665.05s -> 2667.93s]  But given his track record these past few days.
[2667.93s -> 2670.97s]  Well, at least we know who's buying us beer tonight.
[2670.97s -> 2671.93s]  Think that's the truth.
[2673.36s -> 2674.88s]  Okay, so.
[2674.88s -> 2679.52s]  So, it seems Sierra Knox has jumped on the revitalization bandwagon
[2679.52s -> 2682.24s]  and is scheduled for an injection of some sort.
[2682.24s -> 2684.72s]  The doctor who is supposed to help her with the procedure.
[2685.52s -> 2686.48s]  Okay, so I gotta get in here.
[2686.48s -> 2687.60s]  There's a doctor.
[2687.60s -> 2689.44s]  I'm gonna turn into this doctor and I'm gonna poison.
[2694.01s -> 2695.21s]  Can I sprint through?
[2695.21s -> 2697.45s]  If I sprint as fast as I fucking can, can I get through?
[2697.45s -> 2700.65s]  I heard him arguing with that Kronstadt lawyer earlier.
[2700.65s -> 2702.33s]  No, didn't have any luck.
[2702.33s -> 2704.73s]  Once he's done with that other driver, he'll just have to use the-
[2704.73s -> 2705.45s]  Oh, I'm allowed back here.
[2705.45s -> 2705.95s]  Nevermind.
[2712.70s -> 2713.58s]  I thought they were gonna be like,
[2713.58s -> 2714.86s]  Sir, you can't go back there.
[2714.86s -> 2715.50s]  You're not allowed.
[2716.86s -> 2719.90s]  Mr. Durant, I'll ask you to get a move on.
[2719.90s -> 2723.58s]  Sierra Knox coming next for a post race.
[2723.58s -> 2726.36s]  I don't want to keep her waiting.
[2728.36s -> 2730.12s]  Surely you must be able to-
[2730.12s -> 2730.52s]  That's it.
[2730.52s -> 2731.24s]  I can throw him in there.
[2731.24s -> 2738.78s]  Mr. Durant, you've inhaled around a gallon of water by now.
[2738.78s -> 2739.98s]  All right, how do I imitate his voice?
[2756.24s -> 2761.48s]  Hey, don't go in the closet.
[2762.28s -> 2763.47s]  How are we doing?
[2763.47s -> 2764.91s]  Yeah, yeah, relax, Tuck.
[2764.91s -> 2767.23s]  I know you've got Sierra Knox coming in for that fancy-
[2767.23s -> 2767.95s]  That was yest in time.
[2769.07s -> 2770.03s]  I'm doing my best here.
[2770.03s -> 2770.99s]  Oh shit, I need poison.
[2771.95s -> 2774.19s]  I need poison.
[2774.83s -> 2775.95s]  I don't have any poison.
[2776.59s -> 2777.09s]  Uh-oh.
[2778.11s -> 2779.39s]  Where can I get some poison?
[2779.39s -> 2780.27s]  Poison?
[2780.27s -> 2781.15s]  No, that's a sink.
[2782.49s -> 2783.21s]  Poisonous sink?
[2794.19s -> 2795.71s]  Medical staff only, I'm allowed in here.
[2795.71s -> 2796.75s]  Here we go, we got poison.
[2797.63s -> 2798.83s]  Lethal poison jar.
[2799.47s -> 2801.68s]  Ugh.
[2801.68s -> 2806.60s]  Okay, find a key or a crowbar?
[2807.32s -> 2811.60s]  Why don't I find a key or a crowbar?
[2812.32s -> 2814.73s]  Call Sierra to emergency.
[2815.29s -> 2820.22s]  I'm so happy to see you.
[2820.22s -> 2822.54s]  I'm guessing you're here to replace Dr. Sorensen.
[2822.54s -> 2824.38s]  I forget your name, sorry.
[2824.38s -> 2825.26s]  Dr. Reaper.
[2825.26s -> 2827.18s]  Ah, yeah, of course.
[2827.18s -> 2829.26s]  All the medics look alike.
[2829.26s -> 2830.22s]  Find a key or a crowbar?
[2830.22s -> 2831.18s]  Why do I need to find a key?
[2831.82s -> 2833.42s]  I'll prepare for her arrival.
[2834.36s -> 2835.48s]  Dr. Reaper.
[2836.36s -> 2840.41s]  All right, well, there's a key over here.
[2841.21s -> 2843.55s]  Okay.
[2844.17s -> 2848.17s]  Fucking frames.
[2848.97s -> 2849.47s]  Okay.
[2850.33s -> 2850.83s]  So...
[2852.25s -> 2853.29s]  Where is this, uh...
[2853.29s -> 2854.81s]  There's a medical cabinet here, but...
[2855.45s -> 2856.17s]  Oh, there it is.
[2857.71s -> 2858.21s]  Open!
[2858.75s -> 2864.67s]  It's a wrench.
[2869.63s -> 2871.07s]  Get rid of the current patient.
[2871.87s -> 2880.57s]  Can I stab him in the neck?
[2883.32s -> 2884.76s]  How am I gonna get rid of this guy?
[2886.06s -> 2886.56s]  Illegal?
[2887.10s -> 2890.27s]  I don't have anything to throw at him.
[2890.83s -> 2894.59s]  It'll be all right.
[2895.15s -> 2907.48s]  Okay.
[2907.48s -> 2908.44s]  Call Sierra from...
[2908.44s -> 2909.00s]  No, wait, wait, wait.
[2909.00s -> 2909.40s]  Hold on.
[2909.40s -> 2910.52s]  Do I need to poison the drip?
[2911.08s -> 2911.96s]  Let me save it here.
[2916.72s -> 2917.44s]  There's already a...
[2917.44s -> 2918.80s]  Yeah, that's the doctor.
[2930.91s -> 2931.79s]  Blood is suspect.
[2931.79s -> 2934.75s]  Sierra Knox should be on her way to the emergency area.
[2936.17s -> 2936.73s]  Come on down.
[2938.12s -> 2939.08s]  So, poison the drip?
[2939.72s -> 2940.12s]  Right now?
[2940.92s -> 2945.95s]  I'm gonna do it right now.
[2946.51s -> 2954.65s]  Is there anything...
[2954.65s -> 2955.13s]  What's in here?
[2958.36s -> 2959.24s]  Okay, put it in the line.
[2959.24s -> 2960.04s]  So it's in the line now.
[2960.04s -> 2960.54s]  Come on in.
[2964.51s -> 2966.43s]  Dr. President Sleeper.
[2966.43s -> 2975.10s]  Oh, am I gonna give her a haircut too?
[2979.02s -> 2980.30s]  Stop killing people.
[2980.30s -> 2980.86s]  I didn't...
[2980.86s -> 2982.14s]  I just had to...
[2982.14s -> 2983.74s]  Well, yeah, I'm sorry.
[2985.50s -> 2986.62s]  I have nothing there.
[2986.62s -> 2988.06s]  I have nothing to combat that.
[2992.75s -> 2993.95s]  That's a pretty good excuse though.
[2994.67s -> 3007.44s]  Does nobody find it weird that the back of your head is branded?
[3008.16s -> 3010.80s]  Well, I mean, you could always just talk about how
[3011.68s -> 3013.69s]  the tattoo you got when you were younger
[3014.49s -> 3017.71s]  because you're such a fan of the Hitman games.
[3023.42s -> 3024.54s]  Dr. Lasagna.
[3027.92s -> 3030.56s]  Everybody makes that joke because it's a funny joke.
[3030.56s -> 3031.28s]  Can I tell her to come in?
[3031.28s -> 3031.76s]  Get in here.
[3033.84s -> 3034.32s]  I'm ready.
[3035.40s -> 3035.64s]  You.
[3036.60s -> 3037.08s]  Right there.
[3037.82s -> 3038.30s]  Let's go.
[3040.16s -> 3042.08s]  Ms. Knox, I'm ready for you.
[3042.08s -> 3046.08s]  God, I hope I don't break a leg or something.
[3046.08s -> 3046.32s]  Okay.
[3047.50s -> 3048.62s]  Thanks for the input, lady.
[3052.91s -> 3055.07s]  Really great GTA pedestrian thing to say.
[3062.12s -> 3064.12s]  Ms. Knox, come on in.
[3064.12s -> 3065.87s]  Have a seat and relax.
[3065.87s -> 3066.99s]  So, what's on the menu?
[3066.99s -> 3069.71s]  Oh, can you just get out of the way for me?
[3069.71s -> 3071.47s]  Have you ever heard of personal space?
[3071.47s -> 3071.95s]  I promise.
[3071.95s -> 3072.43s]  Shut up.
[3072.43s -> 3076.08s]  Once I'm done, you won't feel a thing.
[3076.08s -> 3076.40s]  All right.
[3076.40s -> 3077.36s]  Sit in that chair.
[3077.36s -> 3079.12s]  So, what's on the menu anyway, doc?
[3079.12s -> 3084.11s]  Mostly floral, extracts, hemlock, belladonna, aconite.
[3084.11s -> 3086.35s]  It's designed to be fast and efficient.
[3086.35s -> 3087.23s]  Fast and efficient.
[3087.23s -> 3088.91s]  Changed disguises.
[3088.91s -> 3090.51s]  Wait, belladonna?
[3091.07s -> 3092.35s]  Isn't that poisonous?
[3092.35s -> 3092.91s]  Yes.
[3092.91s -> 3094.27s]  Should I beat this round?
[3094.27s -> 3094.75s]  I'm not.
[3095.39s -> 3096.35s]  Just relax.
[3096.35s -> 3097.31s]  It'll be over soon.
[3104.99s -> 3105.55s]  Hey, doc.
[3105.55s -> 3106.91s]  Hope we don't need you today, huh?
[3107.79s -> 3110.17s]  How is she going to die?
[3111.21s -> 3111.77s]  Choke?
[3111.77s -> 3112.41s]  Puke?
[3112.41s -> 3113.53s]  Or just roll over in the chair?
[3113.53s -> 3114.49s]  What do you think?
[3114.49s -> 3115.37s]  Hey, you know what?
[3115.37s -> 3117.13s]  I do feel refreshed.
[3117.13s -> 3117.93s]  Thanks, doc.
[3117.93s -> 3119.85s]  My pleasure, Ms. Knox.
[3119.85s -> 3125.45s]  Is she going to puke?
[3126.33s -> 3126.89s]  Oh, god.
[3126.89s -> 3128.97s]  I got to call my dermatologist back.
[3128.97s -> 3130.17s]  Don't worry.
[3130.17s -> 3131.93s]  It'll be over soon, Ms. Knox.
[3136.92s -> 3138.52s]  Both targets down.
[3138.52s -> 3140.12s]  Well done, 47.
[3140.12s -> 3142.28s]  Head for an exit and we'll speak again soon.
[3144.49s -> 3144.81s]  Clean.
[3145.53s -> 3149.24s]  Clean.
[3149.24s -> 3150.68s]  Oh, there's an exit right here.
[3152.60s -> 3153.08s]  Excellent.
[3153.64s -> 3166.24s]  Spotless.
[3173.10s -> 3179.00s]  Okay, now it's time to just go on an absolute insanity run.
[3181.07s -> 3191.34s]  Okay, so let's replay the mission.
[3193.02s -> 3195.84s]  Actually, let's do next and see what we unlocked.
[3195.84s -> 3200.00s]  Stands, toilet, sniper rifle, stands.
[3200.64s -> 3202.14s]  Okay, cool.
[3202.78s -> 3211.87s]  All right, so now let's go back to the menu.
[3213.24s -> 3214.44s]  Challenges, a man in the sea,
[3215.48s -> 3217.92s]  assassin with a fish trophy.
[3222.70s -> 3223.50s]  Sands.
[3224.06s -> 3225.07s]  All right, let's go back.
[3229.50s -> 3230.70s]  I want to replay the mission.
[3230.70s -> 3231.98s]  Re-plan mission for a second.
[3232.70s -> 3238.38s]  I want to bring in to the toilets.
[3239.18s -> 3253.72s]  Okay, let's start at the...
[3255.87s -> 3257.47s]  I start with this costume on.
[3257.47s -> 3258.27s]  Dolphin fountain.
[3259.15s -> 3264.35s]  I guess I'll start in the stands.
[3268.06s -> 3269.50s]  Start at the public toilet.
[3272.25s -> 3276.41s]  I want to see how fast I can eliminate both targets and get up.
[3276.41s -> 3282.49s]  Don't forget, the secret of endurance racing is to keep that car going until the end.
[3282.49s -> 3284.17s]  He's getting into character here.
[3286.17s -> 3287.72s]  All right, hold on.
[3287.72s -> 3288.04s]  Wait a minute.
[3288.04s -> 3288.28s]  Can I...
[3288.92s -> 3291.58s]  Let me see if I can do this.
[3323.34s -> 3324.06s]  What?
[3324.06s -> 3325.02s]  Oh, I got him.
[3325.02s -> 3325.26s]  What?
[3328.94s -> 3331.69s]  Holy shit.
[3335.77s -> 3336.17s]  Nobody...
[3342.86s -> 3344.30s]  No, nobody...
[3344.30s -> 3345.82s]  What about the ones that are driving in now?
[3353.53s -> 3355.53s]  They're gonna smash into it?
[3356.97s -> 3360.52s]  No, I don't think they can hit it.
[3372.36s -> 3372.92s]  Wait a minute.
[3373.80s -> 3377.85s]  That was a pretty quiet grenade.
[3380.41s -> 3381.37s]  Do the Sean B mission?
[3381.37s -> 3382.41s]  Yeah, I'll go do that.
[3382.41s -> 3383.13s]  That sounds like fun.
[3384.60s -> 3386.60s]  That's the patient zero, right?
[3386.60s -> 3393.92s]  Don't forget, the secret of endurance racing is to keep that car going until the end.
[3393.92s -> 3397.36s]  This race is not over until the clock ticks again.
[3398.40s -> 3400.40s]  Wait, let's wait.
[3400.40s -> 3407.68s]  How much time remaining?
[3407.68s -> 3408.96s]  Don't worry, folks.
[3408.96s -> 3410.56s]  Anything can still happen.
[3422.17s -> 3422.41s]  Fuck.
[3434.84s -> 3435.72s]  That guy died?
[3451.92s -> 3452.96s]  I'm trying to punch this guy.
[3454.16s -> 3455.76s]  Why can't I punch this guy?
[3456.72s -> 3458.08s]  All right, let's do the other mission.
[3460.09s -> 3460.73s]  Wait, hold on.
[3460.73s -> 3461.77s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3461.77s -> 3462.17s]  Hold on.
[3471.95s -> 3472.35s]  Bird.
[3473.07s -> 3476.75s]  For newcomers to endurance races, let me remind you that this is difficult,
[3476.75s -> 3486.46s]  and it's all about which team should seize it reliably.
[3486.46s -> 3487.02s]  How did I...
[3491.95s -> 3493.15s]  Two hours later.
[3504.64s -> 3506.88s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[3507.84s -> 3513.53s]  I was trying to throw it over.
[3525.96s -> 3527.48s]  Okay, elusive target.
[3528.62s -> 3529.58s]  47.
[3529.58s -> 3530.14s]  Good morning.
[3530.14s -> 3534.62s]  Your target is Mark Faber, also known as the Undying.
[3534.78s -> 3539.42s]  A disgraced former MI5 operative currently working as a freelance assassin,
[3539.42s -> 3543.74s]  Faber has been confirmed killed by ICA agents more than a dozen times.
[3544.38s -> 3548.14s]  On every occasion, he has managed to come back from the dead.
[3549.64s -> 3553.80s]  We have confirmation that Faber has a meeting in the Miami Bayside Center
[3553.80s -> 3555.80s]  to review details on a new target.
[3555.80s -> 3556.36s]  Illusions.
[3556.36s -> 3560.92s]  An informant at the site has provided us with reliable intel on Faber's expected movement.
[3560.92s -> 3562.60s]  Hmm, he's already taken a helicopter?
[3562.60s -> 3565.48s]  This information has revealed several viable approaches.
[3565.56s -> 3569.00s]  As you know, our inside man is meeting with the target.
[3569.56s -> 3573.80s]  Acquire the right disguise, and he'll get you inside the heart of the building.
[3573.80s -> 3577.32s]  Up close and personal is risky, but favors the clean kill.
[3578.28s -> 3581.64s]  Alternatively, smuggle in a sniper rifle via briefcase.
[3581.64s -> 3582.20s]  I like that idea.
[3582.20s -> 3585.00s]  The race tower is a perfect vantage point.
[3585.00s -> 3585.56s]  That's what I'm doing.
[3585.56s -> 3587.08s]  Access is restricted.
[3587.08s -> 3588.44s]  Race security is high.
[3589.24s -> 3593.16s]  Get through the locked door, and time your shot perfectly.
[3593.16s -> 3593.64s]  I'll get it.
[3594.20s -> 3598.44s]  Or infiltrate through the staff entrance at the back of the building.
[3598.44s -> 3601.08s]  Access the second floor using the elevator shaft.
[3601.64s -> 3606.44s]  Move unseen inside the weapons demo room, and infiltrate as you see fit.
[3606.44s -> 3610.92s]  Act once an opportunity presents itself, or rig the room to your advantage.
[3610.92s -> 3612.36s]  Leave unseen.
[3612.36s -> 3614.12s]  Be mindful, however.
[3614.12s -> 3616.84s]  The repercussions of being exposed here would be severe.
[3616.84s -> 3617.88s]  I'm gonna be very careful.
[3617.88s -> 3621.80s]  I'm confident even more opportunities will reveal themselves once you arrive on site.
[3621.80s -> 3622.84s]  I'm going for the sniper nest.
[3623.80s -> 3627.48s]  To be entirely honest, this one's a bit of an embarrassment.
[3628.04s -> 3630.68s]  Please, make sure he doesn't come back again.
[3630.68s -> 3631.96s]  I should act it.
[3631.96s -> 3635.08s]  Good luck.
[3635.08s -> 3636.04s]  I'm so ready for this.
[3636.60s -> 3637.40s]  One chance.
[3637.40s -> 3638.76s]  You cannot replay a target.
[3638.76s -> 3639.80s]  You only get one chance.
[3639.80s -> 3641.40s]  If you die, it's a game over.
[3641.40s -> 3643.48s]  You only have one time, one window, one death.
[3643.48s -> 3643.88s]  That's it.
[3643.88s -> 3644.44s]  Okay.
[3644.44s -> 3645.40s]  I can't fuck this up.
[3650.11s -> 3650.51s]  All right.
[3650.51s -> 3650.91s]  Planning.
[3651.93s -> 3652.17s]  I...
[3653.05s -> 3653.37s]  Okay.
[3654.41s -> 3656.01s]  Oh, that makes me so nervous.
[3656.01s -> 3656.89s]  Okay, briefcase.
[3657.85s -> 3659.90s]  How do I...
[3659.90s -> 3661.10s]  I want to put in the briefcase...
[3661.98s -> 3662.70s]  The shot...
[3662.70s -> 3663.26s]  Shotgun.
[3663.82s -> 3664.94s]  No, no, don't be an idiot.
[3665.82s -> 3666.30s]  This thing.
[3667.12s -> 3667.60s]  A mace.
[3668.16s -> 3669.20s]  I'm gonna kill him with a mace.
[3670.08s -> 3670.72s]  No.
[3670.72s -> 3677.53s]  What do I have for...
[3677.53s -> 3679.13s]  I don't have any other costumes.
[3679.13s -> 3679.68s]  All right.
[3679.68s -> 3680.56s]  I got it in the briefcase.
[3680.56s -> 3680.96s]  I got...
[3680.96s -> 3682.00s]  I'm gonna take coin.
[3682.00s -> 3682.80s]  I'm gonna lockpick.
[3683.52s -> 3684.25s]  Okay.
[3684.25s -> 3685.13s]  That's in the briefcase.
[3687.05s -> 3687.93s]  Smuggle of fish.
[3688.49s -> 3690.24s]  Not a bad idea.
[3695.18s -> 3695.74s]  I can't.
[3695.74s -> 3696.86s]  Unless he's...
[3696.86s -> 3698.08s]  I'm gonna duck.
[3698.72s -> 3700.19s]  All right.
[3700.19s -> 3700.67s]  One chance.
[3700.67s -> 3700.99s]  That's it.
[3700.99s -> 3701.47s]  Oh, my God.
[3702.27s -> 3704.14s]  I'm ready.
[3704.38s -> 3708.76s]  This contract is an elusive target.
[3708.76s -> 3710.28s]  In playing an elusive target, the following rules apply.
[3710.28s -> 3712.28s]  You must begin the contract before the countdown expires.
[3712.28s -> 3713.80s]  If you die, you may not retry.
[3713.80s -> 3715.96s]  Once you've completed the contract and successfully exited,
[3715.96s -> 3717.48s]  you may not retry the contract.
[3718.12s -> 3720.60s]  You may no longer restart the contract.
[3720.60s -> 3721.72s]  You cannot save your game.
[3731.13s -> 3731.45s]  Shit.
[3738.04s -> 3739.08s]  He already failed?
[3739.08s -> 3740.28s]  I don't say that yet.
[3740.28s -> 3741.16s]  It hasn't happened yet.
[3744.91s -> 3746.27s]  Good afternoon, 47.
[3746.91s -> 3750.03s]  Your target is already inside the Miami Bayside Center.
[3750.83s -> 3753.15s]  Faber has a full day of meetings planned
[3753.15s -> 3755.79s]  and we do not want to risk losing him.
[3755.79s -> 3758.59s]  Take your time with this one.
[3758.59s -> 3760.59s]  Eliminate Mark Faber.
[3761.47s -> 3768.11s]  He's already inside.
[3771.13s -> 3772.17s]  And there's Jerma.
[3775.07s -> 3776.99s]  Dave Ready, our informant,
[3776.99s -> 3779.23s]  is waiting for you in the reception area.
[3779.23s -> 3781.39s]  If you like, he can lead you to a meeting
[3781.39s -> 3783.31s]  where Faber will be in attendance.
[3783.31s -> 3785.47s]  What you do from then on is up to you.
[3786.88s -> 3787.20s]  Be mindful.
[3787.20s -> 3788.24s]  Talk to Dave.
[3788.24s -> 3790.08s]  He will not wait around for long.
[3790.08s -> 3790.72s]  Oh, fuck.
[3791.44s -> 3791.76s]  All right.
[3791.76s -> 3792.56s]  Well, hold on.
[3792.56s -> 3792.80s]  Where?
[3797.77s -> 3798.49s]  Can I go in here?
[3800.27s -> 3800.83s]  Dave's ready.
[3800.83s -> 3801.31s]  Are you?
[3801.31s -> 3803.31s]  Not yet, but I'm going to have to try.
[3807.12s -> 3808.08s]  Hey, what's going on, Dave?
[3810.96s -> 3811.76s]  Dave is ready.
[3811.76s -> 3813.20s]  Ah, yes.
[3813.20s -> 3814.48s]  You're the one I've been expecting.
[3815.04s -> 3816.56s]  The special guest.
[3816.56s -> 3817.44s]  I am.
[3817.44s -> 3818.16s]  Okay.
[3818.16s -> 3820.00s]  So like I told your superiors,
[3820.00s -> 3822.80s]  I can get you inside the meeting, but that's it.
[3822.80s -> 3824.24s]  What you do from there is up to you.
[3825.68s -> 3826.96s]  Just how I like it.
[3826.96s -> 3829.64s]  All right.
[3829.64s -> 3830.52s]  You can't go in dressed like that.
[3830.52s -> 3831.56s]  I thought I was going to be a sniper.
[3832.20s -> 3836.68s]  I'll work something out.
[3836.68s -> 3836.92s]  Good.
[3837.56s -> 3838.92s]  I'll wait when you hear.
[3838.92s -> 3841.88s]  The ICA has struck a deal with Dave ready.
[3841.88s -> 3842.12s]  Okay.
[3843.72s -> 3844.20s]  Hold on.
[3844.20s -> 3845.00s]  Mission stories.
[3846.04s -> 3849.00s]  They're expecting us upstairs in the conference room.
[3849.00s -> 3849.40s]  Okay.
[3849.40s -> 3850.68s]  I need to be an engineer.
[3851.80s -> 3878.41s]  Okay.
[3878.41s -> 3878.65s]  Got it.
[3880.38s -> 3882.86s]  Briefcase and key card.
[3884.35s -> 3884.91s]  All right, Dave.
[3884.91s -> 3885.23s]  I'm ready.
[3885.79s -> 3891.44s]  How's this?
[3891.44s -> 3892.24s]  Where'd you find that?
[3893.52s -> 3894.00s]  Never mind.
[3894.00s -> 3895.08s]  I don't want to know.
[3895.08s -> 3895.88s]  Let's go.
[3895.88s -> 3897.64s]  Dave is already expecting us up there.
[3897.64s -> 3899.08s]  He's expecting us.
[3899.08s -> 3899.80s]  Oh, God.
[3899.80s -> 3900.44s]  But hold on.
[3900.44s -> 3901.08s]  Where are my exits?
[3906.33s -> 3908.25s]  I have a sniper rifle in this briefcase.
[3908.25s -> 3909.13s]  Are they going to search me?
[3911.58s -> 3912.86s]  This guy's with me.
[3912.86s -> 3915.87s]  What you do, I don't understand it.
[3915.87s -> 3917.95s]  This deal is closed when we enter the room.
[3917.95s -> 3918.67s]  All right.
[3918.67s -> 3919.55s]  I get you in.
[3919.55s -> 3920.03s]  That's all.
[3920.59s -> 3922.91s]  And then your people take care of my problem.
[3922.91s -> 3924.03s]  Don't worry.
[3924.03s -> 3925.71s]  We'll fulfill our end of the bargain.
[3925.71s -> 3927.39s]  Is there a place I can snipe from here?
[3928.11s -> 3934.56s]  All the people like them are stupid.
[3934.56s -> 3936.56s]  I thought I could make some quick cash, you know?
[3936.56s -> 3937.68s]  Buy that yacht, sail a couple of...
[3937.68s -> 3938.16s]  Hold on.
[3938.16s -> 3939.36s]  This guy can see right through me.
[3939.36s -> 3940.64s]  ...for the summer.
[3940.64s -> 3943.45s]  Oh, my God, computer.
[3943.45s -> 3944.41s]  Why are you doing this?
[3944.41s -> 3945.93s]  ...somethin' hemisphere.
[3945.93s -> 3948.09s]  You don't try to cheat those kind of people.
[3948.09s -> 3950.25s]  I wish I'd met you a little earlier, buddy.
[3950.25s -> 3952.25s]  Could've used that advice six months ago, you know?
[3953.13s -> 3954.41s]  Anyway, we're almost there.
[3954.41s -> 3956.65s]  So let's put on our game faces.
[3957.37s -> 3957.93s]  Oh, fuck.
[3957.93s -> 3958.09s]  Okay.
[3958.09s -> 3958.89s]  I got to get this right.
[3959.93s -> 3964.83s]  Hey, how you doing?
[3964.83s -> 3965.07s]  He's...
[3965.07s -> 3965.55s]  Is that him?
[3966.27s -> 3966.83s]  So...
[3966.83s -> 3967.55s]  Holy fuck, that's him.
[3967.55s -> 3968.11s]  ...you finally meet.
[3968.11s -> 3968.83s]  That's him, that's him.
[3969.55s -> 3970.19s]  You don't quite...
[3970.19s -> 3972.35s]  I expected.
[3972.35s -> 3973.39s]  Oh, God.
[3973.39s -> 3974.43s]  I'm Faber.
[3974.43s -> 3975.95s]  Mr. Faber!
[3975.95s -> 3978.35s]  What an absolute pleasure to meet you.
[3978.35s -> 3981.71s]  I'm Dave Reddy, special acquisition gatekeeper working with you on this job.
[3982.27s -> 3985.61s]  I'd show you my breakbook when I'm sure you've already heard about me.
[3986.33s -> 3988.11s]  Can't say that I haven't.
[3988.11s -> 3991.21s]  Oh, I see.
[3991.21s -> 4008.89s]  I've prepped an extensive briefing to help with...
[4009.93s -> 4018.86s]  Please help!
[4018.86s -> 4019.34s]  Help me!
[4040.01s -> 4077.64s]  I did it.
[4077.64s -> 4085.77s]  I did it.
[4086.41s -> 4087.13s]  I got to get out of here, though.
[4087.13s -> 4087.45s]  Get out.
[4088.17s -> 4092.57s]  Oh, my God.
[4092.57s -> 4094.17s]  I'm going to burn this computer.
[4094.17s -> 4136.62s]  Explosive penmanship.
[4136.62s -> 4139.82s]  They hit the aquarium and a clean headshot.
[4144.20s -> 4145.92s]  One.
[4145.92s -> 4153.44s]  Better than zero.
[4153.44s -> 4155.45s]  Boat rental hut.
[4155.45s -> 4158.16s]  HWK 21 MK2.
[4158.16s -> 4159.60s]  Explosive pen.
[4159.60s -> 4163.44s]  Florida fit with gloves.
[4163.44s -> 4167.20s]  You're supposed to kill him creatively?
[4168.64s -> 4169.68s]  I'm not good enough for that, man.
[4172.92s -> 4173.24s]  See?
[4173.24s -> 4173.72s]  I just need...
[4173.72s -> 4174.84s]  That's all I want is the checkbox.
[4174.84s -> 4175.88s]  I just want to get the diploma.
[4176.44s -> 4182.57s]  All right, let's go to...
[4183.53s -> 4185.68s]  Let's go to this neighborhood place.
[4191.18s -> 4192.38s]  So let's start.
[4192.38s -> 4194.86s]  I want to start in the construction area.
[4195.58s -> 4198.20s]  Okay.
[4198.92s -> 4202.33s]  I do have this now, but that's not silenced.
[4202.89s -> 4204.32s]  Not like it matters.
[4205.12s -> 4210.25s]  I can't believe you shot that guy and looked cool doing it.
[4210.89s -> 4213.04s]  All right, briefcase.
[4213.84s -> 4215.36s]  I can't take that with the current disguise?
[4216.08s -> 4216.88s]  No, I guess not.
[4218.49s -> 4219.53s]  A fish is okay.
[4220.33s -> 4221.98s]  That's not suspicious.
[4224.84s -> 4226.12s]  Apparently, there's a grenade.
[4226.68s -> 4229.04s]  All right, we'll take the pen.
[4229.60s -> 4233.10s]  All right.
[4233.18s -> 4235.74s]  So let's see what we got for mission stories here.
[4237.64s -> 4238.76s]  Pest control.
[4238.76s -> 4239.56s]  House for sale.
[4241.55s -> 4242.75s]  Whack-a-mole, we did that one.
[4242.75s -> 4243.95s]  No smoking area.
[4244.99s -> 4249.82s]  What about pest control?
[4249.82s -> 4250.78s]  Or house for sale?
[4251.66s -> 4252.78s]  Yeah, let's do house for sale.
[4253.34s -> 4264.49s]  Oh my god.
[4264.49s -> 4278.94s]  What?
[4278.94s -> 4279.50s]  All right, let's go.
[4286.27s -> 4287.39s]  You show him rooms and how...
[4287.39s -> 4287.95s]  We'll find out.
[4288.51s -> 4290.75s]  Did I put it on casual?
[4290.75s -> 4291.55s]  No, I didn't, did I?
[4298.52s -> 4299.72s]  So I'm pretending...
[4299.72s -> 4302.78s]  Don't I have to get like an application to work here?
[4304.72s -> 4306.72s]  Why is 47 just a construction worker?
[4307.28s -> 4318.35s]  All right, so we got radio.
[4322.78s -> 4327.02s]  No, no, no, I want to do the house for sale.
[4330.76s -> 4331.80s]  I think I can see through me.
[4331.80s -> 4332.68s]  Why would I even be here?
[4341.72s -> 4343.16s]  No, don't throw things at people.
[4343.16s -> 4344.84s]  Just do it.
[4344.84s -> 4347.96s]  Don't throw wrenches.
[4347.96s -> 4348.84s]  I always said bricks.
[4349.56s -> 4359.29s]  Jerma loves role play stuff.
[4360.43s -> 4361.15s]  It's kind of fun.
[4361.79s -> 4365.85s]  All right, here we go.
[4366.33s -> 4368.22s]  This is the open house.
[4392.57s -> 4394.25s]  I mean, I can just take as many as I want.
[4398.33s -> 4399.05s]  I want them all.
[4399.05s -> 4399.85s]  Give me all of them.
[4403.37s -> 4404.73s]  Proximity mine?
[4404.73s -> 4405.23s]  No.
[4406.81s -> 4408.01s]  I can say that I do.
[4408.01s -> 4410.01s]  Well, how do I make it explode?
[4410.89s -> 4414.49s]  You know, the one that police are down after the incident.
[4414.49s -> 4416.65s]  I'm not really from around here.
[4416.65s -> 4417.37s]  I don't know.
[4417.37s -> 4419.13s]  I just want to test it and see what it does.
[4419.13s -> 4420.65s]  Well, never mind.
[4420.65s -> 4421.45s]  You can wait a little.
[4421.45s -> 4424.01s]  Oh, I'm not sure I've seen you.
[4433.69s -> 4434.89s]  Anybody else feel that?
[4444.06s -> 4447.02s]  So it's a grenade, but it also can kill people on contact.
[4447.02s -> 4447.52s]  Okay.
[4449.02s -> 4450.22s]  Maybe you know him.
[4450.22s -> 4451.34s]  Mr. Nolan Cassidy.
[4451.34s -> 4451.82s]  All right.
[4451.82s -> 4452.62s]  So this is the guy.
[4452.62s -> 4453.42s]  This is the real estate guy.
[4453.42s -> 4456.14s]  Well, he's interested in the Schmidt house down the road.
[4456.14s -> 4459.74s]  You know, the one that police are down after the, well, incident.
[4459.74s -> 4461.02s]  I'm not really from around here.
[4461.02s -> 4461.58s]  47.
[4461.58s -> 4463.50s]  A real taste for the sweet things in life
[4463.50s -> 4466.46s]  is in Whittleton Creek to show a house to Nolan Cassidy.
[4467.02s -> 4469.74s]  It looks like he's stuck at a local muffin stand.
[4469.74s -> 4470.38s]  Don't be ashamed.
[4470.38s -> 4471.34s]  Keep Cassidy waiting.
[4473.80s -> 4475.08s]  This guy's a server.
[4475.08s -> 4475.80s]  Never mind.
[4475.80s -> 4477.48s]  You can wait a little longer.
[4477.56s -> 4479.88s]  I need to squeeze a couple more of these beauties down.
[4479.88s -> 4480.12s]  All right.
[4480.12s -> 4483.40s]  So there's a server somewhere else in one of these houses.
[4484.12s -> 4490.62s]  The question is, which house was he in?
[4492.62s -> 4493.42s]  Kill him with a muffin.
[4494.96s -> 4497.44s]  No, no, that's, that's too easy.
[4497.44s -> 4500.48s]  I want this guy going to break
[4501.20s -> 4503.21s]  because I know there's another muffin person somewhere.
[4511.92s -> 4513.12s]  Sir, get out of my way.
[4513.93s -> 4514.49s]  I'm leaving.
[4514.49s -> 4515.45s]  Just hold on.
[4515.45s -> 4517.36s]  What's my muffin of choice?
[4517.36s -> 4521.20s]  Chocolate, chocolate chip muffins or cornbread muffin.
[4521.84s -> 4523.92s]  I don't really, not a big muffin guy.
[4525.42s -> 4539.64s]  There's the party muffin in mailbox muffin delivery service.
[4539.64s -> 4541.64s]  Uh, I don't see the server here.
[4547.44s -> 4550.59s]  He's a server, but is he though?
[4550.59s -> 4552.27s]  He's kind of just a guy at the grill.
[4556.56s -> 4558.56s]  Maybe that guy goes on a break.
[4565.56s -> 4566.52s]  Do you go on a break?
[4567.48s -> 4583.48s]  What's the fucking door?
[4589.02s -> 4590.22s]  Oh, that was a stale.
[4591.10s -> 4595.02s]  Those are stale muffins.
[4598.73s -> 4600.78s]  Is there anybody else in the house?
[4601.34s -> 4609.56s]  Where can I put this guy?
[4609.56s -> 4614.72s]  Is there nowhere I can put you?
[4615.60s -> 4618.11s]  Did I bring a fish?
[4618.11s -> 4619.15s]  I did not bring a fish.
[4619.71s -> 4622.99s]  No, he'll be fine.
[4624.96s -> 4626.40s]  Just flush him down the toilet.
[4627.04s -> 4627.52s]  All right.
[4627.52s -> 4628.72s]  Obtain rat poison.
[4629.36s -> 4636.48s]  I wish there was a spit button.
[4636.48s -> 4648.83s]  All right, rat poison.
[4648.83s -> 4650.51s]  And then we're going to go become the realtor.
[4651.07s -> 4654.97s]  Put him in the dryer.
[4661.16s -> 4662.64s]  Knock, knock.
[4662.64s -> 4664.64s]  I'm looking for my secret ingredient.
[4664.64s -> 4668.86s]  Oh, what?
[4668.86s -> 4669.50s]  What?
[4674.56s -> 4676.00s]  Is this the guy that lost a pinwheel?
[4676.96s -> 4677.28s]  Yes.
[4679.00s -> 4679.64s]  Yes, it was.
[4679.64s -> 4681.16s]  It was incredibly embarrassing.
[4685.37s -> 4686.65s]  I couldn't believe it when it happened.
[4687.53s -> 4688.89s]  I cried on stream.
[4688.89s -> 4690.89s]  Tears were just streaming down my fucking face.
[4692.64s -> 4694.16s]  I kept on going like I can't do it.
[4694.16s -> 4694.72s]  I can't.
[4694.72s -> 4696.40s]  I can't fucking do it.
[4697.60s -> 4699.44s]  Everyone's just laughing.
[4699.44s -> 4701.12s]  Laughing, laughing, laughing, laughing.
[4709.00s -> 4710.20s]  Where's the poison?
[4710.20s -> 4716.84s]  I don't see any poison in here.
[4717.48s -> 4719.95s]  There we go.
[4719.95s -> 4720.43s]  All right.
[4720.43s -> 4722.35s]  Place the muffin on a serving plate.
[4731.08s -> 4732.04s]  I picked up a joint.
[4732.52s -> 4733.08s]  Apparently.
[4735.12s -> 4737.76s]  Well, that guy's not me.
[4738.56s -> 4739.88s]  How do I get rid of him?
[4740.44s -> 4745.84s]  If that guy can see right through me,
[4745.84s -> 4747.28s]  then how am I supposed to get around him?
[4755.21s -> 4757.29s]  Am I going to just pretend to be this guy behind him?
[4764.49s -> 4765.61s]  He's kind of distracted.
[4765.61s -> 4768.33s]  Disguise yourself as a real estate broker.
[4772.70s -> 4774.06s]  Just watch me do it.
[4774.78s -> 4777.32s]  You even have to watch it.
[4777.32s -> 4778.52s]  He's got a question mark.
[4779.16s -> 4779.56s]  Huh?
[4780.36s -> 4780.68s]  What?
[4782.12s -> 4782.92s]  I should try it.
[4791.42s -> 4793.66s]  And not just our height.
[4793.66s -> 4794.54s]  Eat the whole thing.
[4800.08s -> 4800.80s]  I feel sick.
[4801.44s -> 4803.97s]  Okay.
[4805.71s -> 4807.39s]  Say hello to your breakfast.
[4807.39s -> 4808.03s]  Okay.
[4808.03s -> 4808.83s]  What was that?
[4808.83s -> 4812.27s]  That was weirdly Microsoft Sam in my ear.
[4813.15s -> 4820.52s]  So where does he go?
[4821.16s -> 4822.97s]  Wait, I can go in the sewer?
[4824.40s -> 4841.12s]  Oh, what?
[4841.12s -> 4842.32s]  I thought I was going to shoot at him.
[4843.53s -> 4844.89s]  That was so anticlimactic.
[4844.89s -> 4846.41s]  I thought I was going to spray straight in the line
[4846.41s -> 4847.29s]  and hit him right in the back.
[4851.79s -> 4852.99s]  Throw him down the sewer.
[4852.99s -> 4853.87s]  Throw him down the sewer.
[4853.87s -> 4854.75s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[4858.59s -> 4859.23s]  Where are you going?
[4877.95s -> 4879.39s]  I'm trying to think of like smoke weed.
[4883.84s -> 4885.20s]  Had to be this trash can.
[4885.20s -> 4886.80s]  Yeah, why this trash can?
[4887.60s -> 4889.92s]  Although here's the problem.
[4890.48s -> 4891.90s]  Okay, I got the key.
[4892.94s -> 4896.08s]  Um, I can stuff him in there.
[4902.24s -> 4904.32s]  That was so loud.
[4904.32s -> 4905.44s]  That's so loud.
[4905.44s -> 4906.56s]  That was louder than anything.
[4907.36s -> 4913.87s]  Put him in the trash can.
[4913.87s -> 4914.67s]  I don't think I can put him.
[4925.42s -> 4925.90s]  Okay.
[4925.90s -> 4927.55s]  Locate and approach Cassidy.
[4928.51s -> 4945.68s]  So where's Cassidy?
[4945.68s -> 4964.97s]  I think it's just on the phone.
[4964.97s -> 4970.97s]  It's the green icon.
[4970.97s -> 4971.85s]  I know where it is.
[4971.85s -> 4973.53s]  I'm just looking to see if there's anything else over here.
[4974.09s -> 4983.31s]  I'm seeing if there's anything else to do.
[4986.68s -> 4987.56s]  Throw the shovel at him.
[4987.56s -> 4988.60s]  I'm not going to throw a shovel at him.
[4988.60s -> 4989.96s]  I'm going to wait until we get in the house.
[4990.60s -> 4992.33s]  Aren't you the realtor?
[4992.33s -> 4992.57s]  Yes.
[4992.57s -> 4995.13s]  Mr. Cassidy, I'm sorry for the delay.
[4995.93s -> 4997.93s]  I'm ready to take you to the house.
[4997.93s -> 4999.05s]  About time.
[4999.77s -> 5000.65s]  Let's go.
[5000.65s -> 5001.69s]  Poke him with the fish.
[5001.69s -> 5002.65s]  All right, unlock the door.
[5003.61s -> 5004.65s]  Last one on the right.
[5007.42s -> 5008.06s]  All right, let's go.
[5008.70s -> 5010.06s]  Do I have to just run ahead?
[5010.06s -> 5010.70s]  Come on, let's go.
[5014.64s -> 5020.20s]  I was planting trees behind the property.
[5022.64s -> 5023.60s]  Pick up, what is it?
[5023.60s -> 5025.76s]  Pick up note for real estate company.
[5026.32s -> 5027.80s]  Unlock the door.
[5035.31s -> 5035.95s]  See?
[5035.95s -> 5036.51s]  It works.
[5037.71s -> 5039.15s]  Who's investigating a distraction?
[5039.79s -> 5042.52s]  Somebody in this house?
[5047.60s -> 5048.32s]  What are you doing in here?
[5050.16s -> 5051.44s]  All right, let's convince him to buy the house.
[5058.27s -> 5058.83s]  Thank you.
[5058.83s -> 5059.31s]  Goodbye.
[5060.96s -> 5061.68s]  All right, the tour.
[5062.56s -> 5063.84s]  So we have a television over here.
[5063.84s -> 5064.56s]  There's a piano.
[5065.36s -> 5065.68s]  TV.
[5066.40s -> 5066.88s]  Take a look.
[5068.40s -> 5069.04s]  Nice TV.
[5070.00s -> 5072.40s]  This is the downstairs living room.
[5072.96s -> 5076.00s]  It is most commonly used for watching television
[5076.00s -> 5079.16s]  and other recreational purposes.
[5079.16s -> 5080.20s]  Yeah, would you like a fish start?
[5080.20s -> 5080.92s]  A large room.
[5081.64s -> 5083.96s]  It's too easy to get to exits.
[5084.92s -> 5087.88s]  Dark floors hide stains easily.
[5088.68s -> 5091.08s]  A room with lots of potential.
[5091.08s -> 5093.08s]  What about storage possibilities?
[5093.64s -> 5094.92s]  Anything of that nature.
[5094.92s -> 5096.84s]  Well, that's why the shovel exists.
[5096.84s -> 5097.72s]  This guy likes sushi.
[5097.72s -> 5102.54s]  All right, come up here.
[5103.34s -> 5104.12s]  Follow me.
[5104.84s -> 5114.75s]  Here's the bathroom.
[5114.75s -> 5116.27s]  There's a lot of storage in the bathroom.
[5117.23s -> 5141.60s]  Oh, hey, how are you?
[5141.60s -> 5143.36s]  Okay, let's take a look at the upstairs.
[5143.36s -> 5155.20s]  Look, there's a TV up here.
[5155.20s -> 5155.84s]  What?
[5155.84s -> 5158.52s]  I turned on the TV.
[5159.72s -> 5161.61s]  Come up here and take a look at the attic.
[5173.00s -> 5173.72s]  What?
[5173.72s -> 5180.33s]  What are you doing?
[5180.33s -> 5181.77s]  Hold on, I'm trying to show him the house.
[5186.84s -> 5190.44s]  A spare bedroom, in case you have a lot of house guests.
[5191.24s -> 5193.96s]  It could also be used as an upstairs office
[5194.84s -> 5198.84s]  or a storage space with easy access to the attic above.
[5199.48s -> 5200.28s]  Yeah, you want to see it?
[5200.28s -> 5200.68s]  I don't know.
[5200.68s -> 5202.04s]  Got anything more interesting to show me?
[5202.04s -> 5202.92s]  It's all very interesting.
[5202.92s -> 5203.96s]  Yeah, come on, come on.
[5203.96s -> 5204.68s]  This way, this way.
[5205.56s -> 5206.12s]  Well, I don't.
[5209.61s -> 5210.81s]  Well, I can't even open this door.
[5211.45s -> 5219.31s]  This room is small.
[5219.31s -> 5220.11s]  I need to wow him.
[5220.11s -> 5221.31s]  I really need to wow him with something.
[5236.88s -> 5242.22s]  Hey.
[5242.22s -> 5242.70s]  What's this?
[5243.34s -> 5246.59s]  You can't go around throwing stuff like that.
[5246.59s -> 5247.47s]  What's the matter with you?
[5248.27s -> 5249.42s]  Oh, no.
[5249.66s -> 5251.34s]  Norman Cassidy is down.
[5251.34s -> 5251.90s]  Good work.
[5252.78s -> 5254.06s]  Janus awaits your attention.
[5264.76s -> 5265.64s]  All right, let's do...
[5265.64s -> 5266.52s]  No, wait.
[5266.52s -> 5267.80s]  Yeah, I'm good right here.
[5267.80s -> 5268.84s]  1808.
[5268.84s -> 5285.53s]  In case you have a lot of house guests.
[5285.53s -> 5286.09s]  Let me see.
[5287.64s -> 5289.16s]  Uh, Intel.
[5289.16s -> 5290.52s]  I cleaned the place as requested.
[5290.52s -> 5293.16s]  I was told the real estate agent would pick up the keys,
[5293.16s -> 5296.28s]  so I put it in the flower pot next to the door.
[5298.73s -> 5300.97s]  It could also be used as an upstairs office.
[5300.97s -> 5302.41s]  Flower pot next to the door.
[5302.41s -> 5305.93s]  Or a storage space with easy access to the attic.
[5306.49s -> 5307.69s]  This is like the president guy.
[5324.78s -> 5325.98s]  Oh, I was like, where the fuck did he go?
[5326.94s -> 5330.62s]  Okay, so we can go down here.
[5332.11s -> 5332.75s]  Follow me.
[5332.75s -> 5333.79s]  We'll show you something interesting.
[5334.51s -> 5341.32s]  Ding dong ditch your own house.
[5341.96s -> 5342.60s]  Here you go.
[5343.40s -> 5348.44s]  So I see the basement has a ample room.
[5348.44s -> 5349.80s]  And here's the basement.
[5350.44s -> 5353.56s]  The usual boiler elements are to be found down here.
[5354.57s -> 5358.41s]  And it seems a room with a safe of some sort.
[5358.57s -> 5361.53s]  Now that's more like it.
[5361.53s -> 5362.65s]  It's like a vault.
[5362.65s -> 5369.40s]  Let's unlock the vault door.
[5369.40s -> 5370.52s]  It's like a vault door to open.
[5370.52s -> 5371.16s]  Okay.
[5371.16s -> 5372.20s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[5372.84s -> 5374.36s]  Nice work, 47.
[5374.36s -> 5376.84s]  Let's hope he doesn't set off the alarm somehow.
[5376.84s -> 5377.40s]  Wait, what?
[5377.40s -> 5379.58s]  Very nice.
[5379.58s -> 5380.22s]  I don't understand.
[5380.22s -> 5380.46s]  Wait, he's-
[5380.46s -> 5382.30s]  All right, let me have a look at this thing.
[5382.30s -> 5383.42s]  Is he able to get murdered?
[5383.42s -> 5385.98s]  The very strong-standing Matrix laser home security system.
[5385.98s -> 5388.54s]  We used to break these open for training at the academy.
[5389.18s -> 5394.16s]  The thing about these systems is most homeowners are lazy.
[5394.16s -> 5395.12s]  Seriously?
[5395.12s -> 5398.32s]  They don't reset the back resets and enter their own codes.
[5398.32s -> 5399.12s]  Push him in?
[5399.12s -> 5401.84s]  Let's just try the standard admin code.
[5401.84s -> 5403.07s]  Just for fun.
[5403.07s -> 5404.43s]  What if I go in?
[5404.99s -> 5412.80s]  Looks like Schmidt was a bigger amateur than I imagined.
[5415.82s -> 5416.46s]  Is he gonna go in?
[5417.10s -> 5424.33s]  Go outside and check the garden.
[5425.05s -> 5428.20s]  How visible this vault is from the outside.
[5428.20s -> 5431.72s]  Anything sticking out of the ground, weird, sloping things like that.
[5431.72s -> 5432.68s]  You got it, sir.
[5432.68s -> 5435.00s]  So you're looking to sell this for, uh, how-
[5435.00s -> 5435.50s]  What?
[5436.28s -> 5437.64s]  Just disable this.
[5438.52s -> 5441.00s]  I never did like these cron-stead systems.
[5441.00s -> 5442.12s]  Or that pompous-
[5442.12s -> 5443.64s]  So you're looking to sell this for-
[5443.64s -> 5444.20s]  What?
[5444.20s -> 5445.16s]  How much was it again?
[5445.16s -> 5445.88s]  1.1.
[5445.88s -> 5447.08s]  Sounds about right.
[5447.08s -> 5448.04s]  I suppose that's not-
[5448.92s -> 5450.76s]  No, don't turn it back on!
[5450.76s -> 5451.40s]  You know what?
[5451.40s -> 5452.60s]  Never mind.
[5452.60s -> 5452.92s]  What?
[5452.92s -> 5454.04s]  I don't think I want to buy this-
[5455.16s -> 5455.80s]  Turn it on.
[5456.76s -> 5463.10s]  Janus awaits your attention.
[5472.86s -> 5478.48s]  Wait, don't turn it back on.
[5483.34s -> 5483.98s]  You know what?
[5483.98s -> 5485.34s]  Ah, never mind.
[5485.34s -> 5485.98s]  I don't care.
[5485.98s -> 5486.86s]  I'm not gonna run.
[5486.86s -> 5488.22s]  I'm just gonna accept my fate.
[5500.03s -> 5501.23s]  No, computer!
[5501.23s -> 5501.79s]  Stop it!
[5506.11s -> 5506.91s]  Never mind.
[5506.91s -> 5508.51s]  I don't want to buy this place.
[5520.80s -> 5521.36s]  All right.
[5521.36s -> 5521.84s]  Let's go-
[5522.88s -> 5524.40s]  What else is there to do?
[5525.76s -> 5526.56s]  An apple a day.
[5527.20s -> 5528.80s]  The story mission did it.
[5528.80s -> 5529.76s]  No smoking.
[5531.07s -> 5531.71s]  We did-
[5531.71s -> 5533.23s]  We kind of started that one.
[5533.79s -> 5535.45s]  Let me try this one.
[5538.40s -> 5540.40s]  Do the dad living in the walls bit.
[5541.12s -> 5550.51s]  What happened with the elusive target?
[5550.51s -> 5552.91s]  Did it first try in less than two minutes.
[5556.14s -> 5556.70s]  Not a lie.
[5557.64s -> 5558.52s]  I didn't make that up.
[5566.75s -> 5568.19s]  Why does she hear that all the-
[5568.19s -> 5569.71s]  She would know you hear that all the way out here.
[5574.70s -> 5575.02s]  All right.
[5575.02s -> 5575.98s]  Cigarettes.
[5575.98s -> 5576.94s]  I'll take them.
[5576.94s -> 5577.66s]  They're back here.
[5580.22s -> 5580.54s]  I don't-
[5580.54s -> 5581.58s]  I can't get back there.
[5582.14s -> 5583.68s]  I have to climb over this.
[5585.37s -> 5586.25s]  Climb through here.
[5586.25s -> 5587.45s]  This is where the tree house is.
[5587.45s -> 5588.09s]  I'm gonna save it.
[5590.22s -> 5591.50s]  You can hear it through the whole house?
[5592.30s -> 5594.65s]  That's the point of a doorbell?
[5594.65s -> 5596.25s]  My doorbell is really silent.
[5596.97s -> 5609.44s]  Blend in as a gardener.
[5609.44s -> 5614.83s]  What is in here?
[5615.39s -> 5619.08s]  Hold on.
[5619.08s -> 5619.40s]  I'm just-
[5619.40s -> 5620.44s]  I'm just exploring a little.
[5620.44s -> 5621.16s]  I'm just curious.
[5621.72s -> 5623.48s]  All right.
[5623.48s -> 5624.52s]  We got a basement.
[5624.52s -> 5624.76s]  Wait.
[5632.46s -> 5632.78s]  Oh.
[5636.08s -> 5636.56s]  Right.
[5636.56s -> 5636.88s]  Okay.
[5638.32s -> 5656.48s]  Okay.
[5656.48s -> 5657.60s]  Nothing over here that I need.
[5659.12s -> 5660.96s]  I need to try to sneak through here.
[5663.05s -> 5666.01s]  I can't unlock this shit from this way.
[5666.01s -> 5667.29s]  I can't even go over there.
[5667.29s -> 5668.49s]  I gotta go all the way around?
[5672.43s -> 5672.83s]  Goodness.
[5673.55s -> 5687.52s]  I'm sorry.
[5687.52s -> 5687.84s]  They had-
[5687.84s -> 5688.96s]  The guy was doing the T-pose.
[5688.96s -> 5689.60s]  I had to get around.
[5689.60s -> 5690.00s]  I had to do-
[5690.00s -> 5691.20s]  That guy was broken.
[5691.20s -> 5729.88s]  All right.
[5729.88s -> 5731.08s]  I'm gonna have a golf club, so...
[5738.04s -> 5738.28s]  What?
[5738.84s -> 5740.20s]  I want to use the golf club.
[5740.92s -> 5744.48s]  I can't do that apparently?
[5746.91s -> 5747.23s]  Wait.
[5747.87s -> 5751.39s]  That's not an ordinary resident of Wittleton Creek 47.
[5751.39s -> 5751.55s]  What?
[5751.55s -> 5754.59s]  This must be one of Cassidy's men working undercover.
[5754.59s -> 5756.51s]  I suggest you keep an eye out for more of them.
[5757.23s -> 5759.05s]  Okay.
[5760.25s -> 5760.65s]  Shovel.
[5763.15s -> 5763.63s]  Anything else?
[5766.00s -> 5766.32s]  All right.
[5766.32s -> 5767.20s]  Smoking kills.
[5775.44s -> 5776.16s]  Use the rake.
[5778.94s -> 5780.14s]  I can't grab the rake.
[5780.14s -> 5780.86s]  Where's there a rake?
[5781.66s -> 5783.72s]  Golf club.
[5783.72s -> 5784.12s]  Shovel.
[5785.08s -> 5787.58s]  Where's there a rake?
[5788.22s -> 5800.33s]  You can just let people walk into the rake.
[5800.33s -> 5800.81s]  Oh, yeah.
[5800.81s -> 5801.45s]  I've seen that.
[5803.31s -> 5804.11s]  I have seen it.
[5805.71s -> 5808.91s]  Well, I'm just gonna move out of here.
[5811.24s -> 5811.88s]  The rake.
[5817.16s -> 5817.96s]  All right.
[5817.96s -> 5819.80s]  I need smoking kills.
[5819.80s -> 5820.84s]  So I have the cigarettes.
[5821.56s -> 5825.66s]  I could give them weed too, couldn't I?
[5825.66s -> 5826.70s]  Give them some marijuana.
[5830.38s -> 5832.54s]  Game's gonna trap you until you find the rake.
[5838.88s -> 5839.84s]  So do I?
[5839.84s -> 5841.60s]  I need to like poison these, don't I?
[5842.40s -> 5849.20s]  Did I lose this opportunity?
[5849.84s -> 5852.54s]  I think I may have lost this opportunity.
[5853.18s -> 5858.51s]  No, there we go.
[5858.51s -> 5860.59s]  One of Janice's guards has apparently
[5860.59s -> 5861.63s]  tossed his cigarettes over the fence
[5861.63s -> 5862.27s]  and into the backyard.
[5862.27s -> 5863.63s]  Janice is using an oxygen apparatus
[5863.63s -> 5864.43s]  to help him breathe better
[5864.43s -> 5865.95s]  and the guard is trying to keep Janice alive.
[5865.95s -> 5866.59s]  Okay.
[5866.59s -> 5868.75s]  So I just go up there and let him smoke the cigarette?
[5872.28s -> 5874.36s]  So just go in the house and have him smoke.
[5875.00s -> 5875.24s]  Okay.
[5879.15s -> 5880.83s]  So where is that old man?
[5880.83s -> 5881.23s]  There he is.
[5888.78s -> 5889.82s]  These guys are gonna let me in, right?
[5896.57s -> 5896.89s]  Really?
[5898.86s -> 5899.18s]  Okay.
[5901.18s -> 5903.24s]  Well, fine.
[5903.24s -> 5904.28s]  I'm going through a fucking window.
[5913.52s -> 5914.56s]  Don't load the game.
[5915.36s -> 5916.00s]  Save the game.
[5933.58s -> 5933.90s]  All right.
[5933.90s -> 5934.54s]  Let's see.
[5934.54s -> 5935.50s]  Who's the closest person?
[5936.06s -> 5938.49s]  Should I like lie down?
[5939.79s -> 5940.91s]  Perform health check.
[5941.95s -> 5948.88s]  All right.
[5948.88s -> 5949.52s]  Where's that guy going?
[5949.52s -> 5950.72s]  I need to take that guy's disguise.
[5951.52s -> 5953.48s]  There he goes.
[5953.48s -> 5954.20s]  You coming in here?
[5960.22s -> 5960.46s]  Shit.
[5962.67s -> 5963.95s]  I gotta go around him.
[5963.95s -> 5964.91s]  Or you need to come in here.
[5965.79s -> 5972.33s]  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.
[5973.93s -> 5974.65s]  Quickly, quickly.
[5974.65s -> 5975.37s]  Come on, come on, come on.
[5985.96s -> 5986.52s]  Excellent.
[5987.60s -> 5988.32s]  Pick up the Uzi.
[5988.96s -> 5989.36s]  Hide it.
[5990.33s -> 5990.57s]  Okay.
[5991.39s -> 5992.67s]  Time to give him his cigarettes.
[5995.08s -> 5996.68s]  You guys can all see through my disguise.
[5998.67s -> 6000.43s]  It's kind of annoying.
[6013.10s -> 6014.14s]  Say, Gunter.
[6014.14s -> 6016.57s]  Did you see my photograph?
[6016.57s -> 6018.97s]  The group photo from the first gathering?
[6020.01s -> 6022.25s]  Janice is looking for an old group photo.
[6022.81s -> 6025.21s]  It might be interesting to see who's always in his brief.
[6025.21s -> 6026.41s]  No, I need cigarettes.
[6027.69s -> 6030.91s]  Turn on the cigarettes.
[6032.03s -> 6035.15s]  How do I like put plant cigarettes over here so he smokes them?
[6035.15s -> 6035.63s]  Here we go.
[6038.16s -> 6039.28s]  Rig the oxygen tank.
[6040.00s -> 6044.06s]  All right.
[6044.06s -> 6045.10s]  And then hide in the closet.
[6045.10s -> 6046.22s]  Good work, 47.
[6046.78s -> 6053.39s]  All there is left to do now is wait.
[6053.39s -> 6053.79s]  I did it.
[6057.48s -> 6059.72s]  I just read the game FAQ?
[6059.72s -> 6059.96s]  No.
[6065.29s -> 6065.69s]  Yes.
[6066.57s -> 6071.56s]  I'm gonna be in here.
[6071.56s -> 6072.36s]  Look at how far away he is.
[6072.36s -> 6073.56s]  I'm gonna be here for a long time.
[6080.06s -> 6082.84s]  Uh, save?
[6082.84s -> 6083.88s]  I got an auto-save.
[6083.88s -> 6084.12s]  I'm good.
[6084.84s -> 6094.65s]  Can I hide under the bed or somewhere that I can see better?
[6095.45s -> 6106.20s]  All right, here he comes.
[6106.84s -> 6107.80s]  Let's get a save here.
[6108.36s -> 6115.32s]  I'm coming upstairs.
[6118.14s -> 6119.10s]  No, is he actually...
[6119.10s -> 6121.90s]  He's not gonna go out and look at the mole hills, right?
[6122.62s -> 6125.82s]  Do the grandpa voice.
[6125.82s -> 6126.30s]  Oh, okay.
[6126.30s -> 6127.74s]  This is fucking stupid.
[6128.91s -> 6132.49s]  I hate this place and I hate all of you idiots.
[6132.49s -> 6133.61s]  Taking away my cigarettes.
[6134.25s -> 6143.76s]  That's your last fucking straw.
[6143.76s -> 6144.40s]  He's doing it.
[6144.40s -> 6145.36s]  He's doing the voice.
[6145.36s -> 6145.92s]  He's doing it.
[6149.82s -> 6150.54s]  So funny story.
[6150.54s -> 6155.02s]  I was at the grocery store and they got so many pastas there.
[6155.02s -> 6156.94s]  How are you supposed to pick up your favorite pasta?
[6157.50s -> 6161.32s]  I just fell backwards in my chair and like hurt myself.
[6170.96s -> 6172.56s]  That would have been pretty fucking crazy.
[6173.44s -> 6175.20s]  I would have caused damage.
[6175.84s -> 6182.20s]  Where's this old fucking man?
[6182.20s -> 6183.88s]  Might as well just get out and just hang out in here.
[6195.29s -> 6196.17s]  Sit in his chair.
[6196.89s -> 6199.29s]  I was gonna breathe in his oxygen.
[6201.40s -> 6201.96s]  You coming?
[6214.65s -> 6215.93s]  You old fucking man.
[6216.89s -> 6217.85s]  Hurry up and get up here.
[6220.73s -> 6221.69s]  Turn on the radio.
[6222.65s -> 6229.05s]  Pee in his bed.
[6246.56s -> 6248.08s]  I'm being patient.
[6248.08s -> 6250.08s]  I am being very patient.
[6250.64s -> 6252.88s]  I'm playing this correct.
[6252.88s -> 6253.76s]  We're just hanging out.
[6253.76s -> 6255.12s]  We're playing it right.
[6255.92s -> 6259.00s]  Bro, you are so fucked.
[6260.94s -> 6261.42s]  Am I though?
[6262.92s -> 6263.64s]  I don't think so.
[6271.80s -> 6274.12s]  You haven't lived until you peed in another man's bed.
[6277.74s -> 6278.78s]  How would they know it was me?
[6281.79s -> 6282.51s]  If I peed in...
[6282.51s -> 6283.15s]  Okay, here we go.
[6283.71s -> 6289.18s]  He'd probably think it was a cat or a dog or something.
[6289.18s -> 6290.40s]  This is it.
[6290.40s -> 6291.20s]  This is the climax.
[6291.76s -> 6294.83s]  I'm ready for it.
[6299.56s -> 6300.44s]  Fresh cigarettes.
[6301.71s -> 6302.83s]  Rigged up oxygen tank.
[6303.39s -> 6308.35s]  How's he doing?
[6308.35s -> 6311.66s]  Just sit in that chair.
[6314.68s -> 6315.18s]  Uh-huh.
[6315.80s -> 6316.30s]  Almost.
[6317.42s -> 6317.92s]  Almost.
[6318.46s -> 6320.22s]  He's almost there.
[6320.94s -> 6321.90s]  That's a little closer.
[6323.07s -> 6323.87s]  Okay, he's there.
[6325.08s -> 6327.40s]  Ah, I think I have a pack of fresh cigarettes.
[6347.07s -> 6347.57s]  Whoa!
[6350.19s -> 6350.69s]  What?
[6351.87s -> 6352.67s]  That was quick.
[6353.87s -> 6354.99s]  That was really quick.
[6356.27s -> 6357.87s]  Hold on, wait.
[6357.87s -> 6358.37s]  Is that...
[6361.45s -> 6362.89s]  Is that camera up there going to be there?
[6363.53s -> 6367.15s]  I want to see something.
[6367.71s -> 6375.16s]  If that camera is up there, I want to try something.
[6375.80s -> 6389.02s]  Let's wait till it gets right here.
[6391.18s -> 6392.22s]  Joke incoming.
[6393.31s -> 6393.81s]  Um...
[6394.35s -> 6395.39s]  No, not really.
[6395.39s -> 6397.79s]  More like I want to see if the angle shows me do this.
[6398.35s -> 6399.53s]  Which would be funny.
[6406.38s -> 6407.02s]  Joke alert.
[6407.58s -> 6408.46s]  Joke alert.
[6408.46s -> 6409.26s]  Joke alert.
[6409.98s -> 6417.16s]  So we're going to see the picture in picture up there.
[6424.25s -> 6425.37s]  Come on, let's see it.
[6425.37s -> 6426.01s]  Picture in picture.
[6426.01s -> 6426.51s]  I want to see it.
[6428.41s -> 6430.56s]  Here we go.
[6443.55s -> 6449.34s]  I think you can see it.
[6454.46s -> 6455.26s]  The top left.
[6458.67s -> 6462.89s]  Peek through the window.
[6462.89s -> 6463.61s]  I... you can't.
[6464.41s -> 6465.98s]  That wasn't a...
[6465.98s -> 6466.78s]  I wasn't a joke.
[6466.78s -> 6468.06s]  I was just seeing what would happen.
[6468.70s -> 6471.77s]  I want to see if the picture in picture turned off.
[6475.16s -> 6480.48s]  I thought you could throw the baseball at him.
[6480.48s -> 6481.28s]  Oh, fuck.
[6481.28s -> 6481.84s]  You're right.
[6482.48s -> 6486.94s]  I'm going to get up and point blank throw it at his face.
[6505.90s -> 6507.98s]  Just point blank throw it as hard as you can.
[6513.21s -> 6513.93s]  Did that kill him?
[6521.74s -> 6522.46s]  No, I'm done.
[6533.68s -> 6535.52s]  First constant catch up with you.
[6537.07s -> 6539.95s]  That feels like an easy way out for a man like Janus.
[6539.95s -> 6540.59s]  I did that.
[6541.47s -> 6541.97s]  Still.
[6543.48s -> 6545.32s]  We are close now, gentlemen.
[6545.32s -> 6546.44s]  Both targets are dead.
[6560.38s -> 6561.82s]  All right, well, that was fun.
[6563.64s -> 6565.00s]  Anybody smiling in here?
[6565.00s -> 6566.20s]  What do you mean smiling?
[6607.07s -> 6614.96s]  Fuck the brownies.
[6614.96s -> 6626.46s]  Pop 100.
[6626.46s -> 6627.90s]  Oh, we're all the way back here.
[6627.90s -> 6629.26s]  Don't replay the whole mission.
[6632.91s -> 6633.95s]  He's checked out.
[6635.93s -> 6638.09s]  This guy is totally checked the fuck out right now.
[6657.63s -> 6658.43s]  Trying to throw them.
[6664.41s -> 6665.69s]  Throw it off screen.
[6666.73s -> 6667.21s]  Hold on.
[6667.21s -> 6668.33s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[6668.33s -> 6677.74s]  It's when he said as old, like right here.
[6688.62s -> 6689.90s]  Throw it at the camera.
[6691.92s -> 6693.20s]  I'm going to throw it at the camera.
[6693.76s -> 6701.24s]  That actually might be kind of funny because then it would bounce off the wall.
[6701.24s -> 6702.28s]  All right, let's go try that.
[6703.00s -> 6704.36s]  And then I'm going to load a different mission.
[6708.35s -> 6709.71s]  Don't give him any more ideas.
[6721.37s -> 6721.85s]  Shit.
[6721.85s -> 6723.37s]  Oh, I did it wrong.
[6723.37s -> 6724.01s]  I have to kill him.
[6725.05s -> 6734.28s]  Throw the joint.
[6734.28s -> 6736.84s]  Now, I got to kill both these guys while the camera is on.
[6737.72s -> 6739.08s]  I'm going to throw it into the camera.
[6740.04s -> 6740.60s]  Like right now.
[6740.60s -> 6741.00s]  Here we go.
[6743.24s -> 6743.72s]  Guard.
[6743.72s -> 6744.52s]  What's up?
[6744.52s -> 6745.88s]  What's this guy's problem?
[6745.88s -> 6746.76s]  Christ sakes.
[6747.90s -> 6748.38s]  That's enough.
[6751.98s -> 6754.32s]  Okay, here we go.
[6764.80s -> 6765.04s]  No.
[6775.88s -> 6776.68s]  It turned off.
[6776.68s -> 6777.56s]  Hold on.
[6777.56s -> 6781.00s]  This is the last time and I'm going to open up another mission
[6781.00s -> 6782.92s]  because we're just fucking around at this point.
[6782.92s -> 6786.67s]  The cameraman fucked it up.
[6786.67s -> 6791.18s]  I'm going to make this quick.
[6791.18s -> 6805.82s]  I didn't do it.
[6816.65s -> 6817.61s]  Last fucking time.
[6817.61s -> 6818.81s]  I promise this is the last time.
[6844.57s -> 6846.01s]  No, it wasn't even fucking worth it.
[6846.65s -> 6848.57s]  I almost just alt tab and deleted the game.
[6851.84s -> 6852.48s]  All right, go back.
[6852.48s -> 6852.80s]  Get back.
[6852.80s -> 6853.36s]  We're going out.
[6870.92s -> 6871.24s]  All right.
[6872.92s -> 6873.96s]  I think I broke everything.
[6877.66s -> 6878.70s]  Let's go here.
[6883.13s -> 6883.77s]  Alt tab.
[6885.48s -> 6887.56s]  Didn't even take the first step in doing that.
[6888.92s -> 6890.64s]  Let's go here.
[6892.46s -> 6893.34s]  Quiet mode.
[6898.84s -> 6905.74s]  It's taking syringe.
[6907.23s -> 6909.39s]  I thought quiet mode was only supposed to be three hours.
[6910.03s -> 6910.35s]  Yeah.
[6911.98s -> 6913.10s]  Yeah, it was.
[6918.08s -> 6919.04s]  Get in that dryer.
[6920.64s -> 6921.20s]  All right, what is it?
[6921.20s -> 6924.16s]  I want to start at the chapel.
[6924.16s -> 6932.16s]  It didn't last two hours.
[6932.80s -> 6937.36s]  You know, part of me thinks I'm going to go back.
[6937.36s -> 6940.00s]  I think I'm going to go back and play Quiet Man again after this.
[6940.72s -> 6945.58s]  I think I'm going to go back and beat it at the end.
[6954.28s -> 6954.52s]  What?
[6954.52s -> 6967.40s]  Oh, they didn't do anything.
[6972.46s -> 6973.66s]  They're all trying to get out.
[6974.54s -> 6976.54s]  They're all becoming one person.
[6976.54s -> 6982.49s]  That is the most single file.
[6982.49s -> 6988.99s]  Do these people just spawn in?
[6995.74s -> 6997.02s]  Did I put anything in the briefcase?
[6997.66s -> 7011.58s]  You need to try to put a mine there.
[7011.58s -> 7017.64s]  Oh, whoops.
[7017.64s -> 7024.48s]  Go put a trap at that exit.
[7024.48s -> 7025.60s]  Oh, god damn it.
[7038.65s -> 7040.49s]  Chat plays Hitman 2.
[7040.49s -> 7042.99s]  I wasn't allowed to be here, apparently.
[7044.80s -> 7045.28s]  Hey, you.
[7045.28s -> 7045.84s]  Hey, you.
[7045.84s -> 7046.64s]  Hey, you.
[7046.64s -> 7047.12s]  Hey, you.
[7048.00s -> 7048.80s]  Excuse me.
[7048.80s -> 7067.76s]  Oh, that's a briefcase.
[7068.56s -> 7071.48s]  I got caught.
[7072.36s -> 7079.44s]  That just backfired completely.
[7082.46s -> 7091.10s]  I can't really go down from here.
[7091.10s -> 7092.46s]  I have to like sneak over there.
[7092.46s -> 7093.42s]  Let me try this one more time.
[7094.14s -> 7103.37s]  I got one person.
[7104.33s -> 7104.97s]  Wait, what?
[7106.44s -> 7106.76s]  What?
[7109.50s -> 7128.28s]  That took so long to get there.
[7136.83s -> 7147.26s]  Oh, this game is fucking ridiculous.
[7147.26s -> 7149.58s]  I didn't know I could throw it from this far away.
[7149.58s -> 7151.82s]  Look, what happens if I just throw the suitcase from right here?
[7152.46s -> 7155.58s]  Can I like target somebody down there?
[7156.22s -> 7169.29s]  This is not going to reach, so it's not even.
[7170.01s -> 7171.68s]  Wait, hold on.
[7171.68s -> 7173.60s]  I can lock on to somebody over there.
[7174.16s -> 7176.78s]  Hold on a second.
[7176.78s -> 7177.58s]  Did you hear that?
[7177.58s -> 7178.46s]  That's weird.
[7178.46s -> 7186.01s]  Hold on a second.
[7186.65s -> 7193.88s]  Throw a coin.
[7194.60s -> 7198.65s]  I'm so happy he found this out.
[7199.95s -> 7201.87s]  Well, I mean, at this point, I'm just fucking dicking around.
[7201.87s -> 7206.20s]  So, so hold on.
[7206.84s -> 7211.31s]  I'm currently on locked on to somebody down there.
[7211.31s -> 7213.79s]  Can I go all the way across, like all the way that way?
[7224.17s -> 7224.89s]  Catching something.
[7224.89s -> 7225.45s]  Okay, hold on.
[7234.41s -> 7235.37s]  Holy shit.
[7242.73s -> 7243.53s]  That's insane.
[7246.65s -> 7247.93s]  I almost hold on a minute.
[7247.93s -> 7249.61s]  What if I scare everybody and then do it?
[7254.92s -> 7256.76s]  Is it possible that I could scare everybody, throw it?
[7257.32s -> 7269.15s]  Is it only the briefcase or can I do it with this?
[7269.79s -> 7270.91s]  Oh, man.
[7270.91s -> 7271.71s]  Okay, hold on.
[7279.77s -> 7280.41s]  Okay, here you go.
[7280.97s -> 7282.36s]  Are we going to run?
[7291.90s -> 7292.38s]  Not yet.
[7293.18s -> 7297.87s]  I need to scare everybody.
[7299.15s -> 7303.04s]  Come on.
[7303.04s -> 7304.86s]  Here we go.
[7304.86s -> 7310.92s]  Where did it go?
[7322.06s -> 7323.34s]  I got to get this group to run.
[7324.22s -> 7331.90s]  Now, it's just a random person ducking.
[7331.90s -> 7333.18s]  That guy was already on the ground.
[7340.36s -> 7340.84s]  Gone.
[7340.84s -> 7341.16s]  Got him.
[7376.84s -> 7378.60s]  No, one flyover.
[7378.60s -> 7380.88s]  Take them all you got.
[7381.44s -> 7384.57s]  I was hoping I could get like pushed off.
[7388.52s -> 7388.92s]  All right.
[7390.75s -> 7392.03s]  I think I'm going to go back here.
[7397.61s -> 7398.57s]  It's time.
[7398.57s -> 7399.45s]  I think it's time.
[7404.68s -> 7406.12s]  End of stream, voice.
[7406.12s -> 7411.85s]  Go back to Quiet Man.
[7414.78s -> 7417.26s]  Yeah, I'm sorry that the technical problems kind of
[7417.90s -> 7419.74s]  threw it under the bus when we moved to Hitman,
[7423.08s -> 7426.41s]  but Quiet Man didn't last long.
[7426.41s -> 7429.77s]  Well, it lasted long enough and then everybody voted for me to get off Quiet Man
[7429.77s -> 7433.29s]  and I went to Hitman and then my computer couldn't handle it for some reason.
[7437.47s -> 7438.75s]  Now, let me get out of here for a second.
[7439.31s -> 7440.72s]  No, I want to see the credits.
[7441.76s -> 7443.04s]  That was all we're going to do with Hitman.
[7443.84s -> 7449.72s]  Thanks for watching Hitman.
[7454.97s -> 7461.77s]  And one second.
[7461.77s -> 7481.52s]  You could have just finished a game people aren't playing much and it was.
