[4.34s -> 6.98s]  I'm going to lower the volume so it's not horrible.
[6.98s -> 20.78s]  Can one of the mods make the game, uh, sorcery?
[20.78s -> 25.37s]  It ends June 26th at 10 a.m. Oh.
[25.37s -> 30.30s]  All right. But the demos aren't going away, right?
[30.30s -> 32.62s]  If I get some more of them. Or maybe they are.
[32.62s -> 42.46s]  Hey, you haven't seen this in a very long time.
[42.46s -> 46.71s]  Most of them are. Some of them, but not all of them.
[46.71s -> 53.46s]  All right. So. Hello everybody. Welcome back to sorcery.
[53.46s -> 59.56s]  This is technically the third part. This is episode three of sorcery.
[59.56s -> 64.47s]  Let's go over this. Probably. I think there's a lot of new viewers here over the last year.
[65.78s -> 72.62s]  I would highly recommend you go watch the sorcery part one and part two.
[72.62s -> 74.78s]  We're technically on the third game.
[76.23s -> 79.59s]  If you want a quick recap, I can give it to you.
[83.46s -> 93.11s]  But I need a recap too. This is a choose your own adventure game.
[93.11s -> 97.14s]  It's based on a series of books by Steve Jackson.
[97.14s -> 101.38s]  Steve Jackson made a ton of choose your own adventure books.
[103.19s -> 108.47s]  This series is one of them. Wildly seen as the best in all of the.
[108.47s -> 110.23s]  Well, that's subjective.
[111.42s -> 114.44s]  But of all the books that Steve Jackson did.
[115.00s -> 119.59s]  This is considered to be a really the good ones. The really good ones.
[119.59s -> 123.96s]  You can buy these books. These books still exist.
[124.52s -> 134.84s]  But this company, Inkle, took all the books and made them into a full complete board game.
[134.84s -> 136.44s]  Where all the choices are the same.
[136.44s -> 139.16s]  It's pretty much a one to one reimagining of the whole thing.
[143.02s -> 144.30s]  There's a lot of choices.
[144.30s -> 146.62s]  The choices matter a lot in this game.
[146.62s -> 150.47s]  You can screw up big time.
[150.47s -> 152.23s]  We had a thing where the amount of Ruwa.
[152.23s -> 153.11s]  Who is he talking to?
[154.55s -> 155.83s]  My mother's on speaker right now.
[157.35s -> 158.07s]  She's muted.
[158.07s -> 159.43s]  But come on. I'm trying to tell.
[159.43s -> 161.24s]  My mother wants to catch up.
[161.24s -> 162.04s]  Still there, Ma?
[162.04s -> 164.09s]  All right. Yep.
[164.09s -> 171.24s]  So Ma, when you last saw, we were in the Baklans.
[171.24s -> 173.21s]  These are the Baklans.
[173.21s -> 174.41s]  The first two episodes.
[174.41s -> 176.81s]  I saw spoilers, by the way, if you don't want to miss any of it.
[176.81s -> 179.06s]  If you want to see the whole thing as it played out.
[179.06s -> 180.74s]  Very high quality entertainment.
[180.74s -> 182.74s]  Really, really engaging stuff.
[183.48s -> 184.52s]  I recommend you watch it.
[184.52s -> 185.88s]  But if you don't care and you're just like,
[185.88s -> 188.74s]  I just want to see the guy click on stuff.
[188.74s -> 192.14s]  The last thing that we did, we got.
[192.14s -> 194.20s]  We are the Annalander.
[194.20s -> 197.94s]  Our goal is to go get the Crown of Kings.
[197.94s -> 200.92s]  The Crown of Kings is the most powerful artifact in the world.
[200.92s -> 202.36s]  It has the power to do anything.
[203.32s -> 206.94s]  Essentially, you're turning on god powers if you have the crown.
[206.94s -> 211.42s]  The Archmage, who is the main antagonist of the game, has the crown.
[211.42s -> 214.49s]  Stole it.
[214.49s -> 216.58s]  We need to get it back.
[216.58s -> 219.37s]  We went through treacherous shit.
[219.37s -> 226.89s]  We are currently going through the Baklans.
[226.89s -> 234.36s]  Interestingly enough, there are assassins now trying to kill us.
[234.36s -> 241.14s]  In episode three, in the third game, your goal is to get through all of the Baklans
[241.14s -> 246.02s]  and killing and taking the essence of all of the serpents.
[246.02s -> 250.62s]  There are seven serpents and they are trying to kill me.
[250.62s -> 254.78s]  We have already killed one or two of them.
[254.78s -> 256.84s]  I forget who they were.
[256.84s -> 267.10s]  The Final Fantasy 16 panel is still up.
[267.10s -> 270.39s]  Sorry, Square Enix was really good to me, so they can stay.
[271.67s -> 278.68s]  Square Enix was wonderful to work with, so I mean...
[282.58s -> 290.38s]  Anyways, anyways, we're going to just see what the last few things were.
[292.49s -> 294.25s]  So we were talking to somebody.
[294.25s -> 296.23s]  There's time travel.
[296.23s -> 298.39s]  Keep up.
[298.39s -> 303.11s]  Each one of these devices, there are two full maps in this game.
[303.11s -> 304.55s]  One of them is in the past.
[304.55s -> 306.15s]  The other one is in the present.
[306.15s -> 310.46s]  We need to go back to the past, moving these units around.
[310.46s -> 315.10s]  Wherever these units shine in that cone is in the past.
[317.26s -> 317.82s]  Can you follow?
[317.82s -> 318.22s]  Keep up.
[318.22s -> 319.99s]  Come on, Gwen.
[319.99s -> 323.67s]  We need to go find some serpents in the past.
[323.67s -> 324.07s]  Keep up.
[324.07s -> 328.18s]  Come on, Gwen.
[328.18s -> 329.30s]  The last thing that just happened...
[331.70s -> 335.62s]  Actually, let me play one of the best songs ever recorded.
[335.86s -> 336.74s]  Let's do that first.
[336.74s -> 337.86s]  Let's take a look at some of the spells.
[337.86s -> 339.22s]  We're just doing a recap, I know.
[339.22s -> 340.66s]  Some of you are probably like, all right, fuck this guy.
[340.66s -> 341.38s]  I'm out of here.
[341.38s -> 341.86s]  That's all right.
[341.86s -> 342.18s]  That's fine.
[342.18s -> 342.82s]  We'll see you later.
[345.03s -> 352.04s]  If you're wondering where the sus command is from, it's not because I'm the fucking sus guy.
[352.90s -> 353.78s]  That's not what it is.
[354.68s -> 357.08s]  This is from seven or eight years ago.
[358.28s -> 359.48s]  Sus is a command.
[360.20s -> 362.60s]  It's a spell in sorcery.
[364.81s -> 369.29s]  There are dozens of spells that you can do in most scenarios.
[369.29s -> 370.41s]  They give you pretty good options.
[372.71s -> 374.39s]  Stuff like jig.
[375.03s -> 379.18s]  When cast, the recipient will get an uncontrollable urge to dance.
[379.18s -> 380.06s]  This works.
[380.06s -> 381.50s]  You can do these to pretty much anybody.
[382.06s -> 385.21s]  There it is.
[386.58s -> 389.46s]  It's sense danger is the name of the spell.
[389.46s -> 390.58s]  That's where it's originally from.
[391.14s -> 397.16s]  Could you please say Steve Jackson's sorcery in your sorcery voice?
[397.16s -> 397.64s]  Yeah.
[397.64s -> 409.96s]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the third episode of Steve Jackson's sorcery.
[409.96s -> 412.98s]  There you go.
[412.98s -> 413.94s]  You can use that wherever you want.
[418.09s -> 420.09s]  I want the song to replay though.
[420.09s -> 426.54s]  Oh, we have a god too.
[426.54s -> 427.34s]  We have spirits.
[427.34s -> 432.30s]  So right now you can pray to your spirit.
[432.30s -> 434.84s]  Our spirit right now is the ape.
[434.84s -> 439.70s]  If we're in a bad scenario, something bad is happening.
[439.70s -> 440.90s]  Oh my god.
[440.90s -> 441.94s]  I don't know what to do here.
[441.94s -> 445.54s]  They give you an option to pray to your spirit.
[445.54s -> 446.50s]  Sometimes they listen.
[447.06s -> 448.42s]  Sometimes they don't.
[448.42s -> 452.10s]  Sometimes they actually think it's funny when something bad is happening to you.
[452.10s -> 453.80s]  Depends on who you have.
[453.80s -> 456.20s]  There are dozens and dozens, if not thousands.
[456.20s -> 457.24s]  It's probably like 10.
[457.24s -> 460.15s]  We have the ape right now.
[460.15s -> 462.23s]  Strong beast, intelligent, and prudent.
[462.23s -> 466.81s]  Who takes great pride in acting faithfully to be depended on.
[466.81s -> 468.66s]  So we can depend on the ape.
[468.66s -> 475.54s]  Sometimes it's like the scorpion or the panther.
[476.02s -> 477.62s]  And they have different things that they do.
[477.62s -> 480.54s]  You can also pray to heal.
[480.54s -> 481.58s]  We have 29 gold.
[481.58s -> 483.58s]  I have three stamina.
[483.58s -> 484.46s]  Why don't we take a look at the...
[485.38s -> 487.14s]  This is the song.
[487.14s -> 490.44s]  Clues.
[492.39s -> 493.27s]  All right.
[493.27s -> 495.35s]  We need to read some of these because it's been a long time.
[495.35s -> 497.03s]  The seven serpents weaknesses.
[498.04s -> 499.00s]  They all have a weakness.
[499.56s -> 506.90s]  The seven serpents threaten your journey.
[506.90s -> 510.26s]  But they carry a message that will warn the archmage of your coming.
[510.26s -> 512.74s]  But each has a weakness that if discovered will allow you to destroy them.
[515.56s -> 516.06s]  Okay.
[516.76s -> 517.88s]  I think we just start moving.
[518.52s -> 519.02s]  We...
[520.28s -> 520.78s]  You know?
[522.07s -> 524.22s]  Thankfully we can see where we've been.
[524.22s -> 526.38s]  So the last thing that happened was...
[526.38s -> 531.19s]  What was the last thing?
[531.19s -> 531.99s]  Dentainter.
[531.99s -> 533.03s]  Dentainter of the steps.
[533.03s -> 533.51s]  They call me...
[533.51s -> 535.37s]  Wait, wasn't this a serpent?
[535.37s -> 538.01s]  I intend to kill the seven serpents who tell her and she laughs.
[538.33s -> 539.69s]  Many have had that intention.
[539.69s -> 542.26s]  Very few know their weaknesses.
[542.26s -> 543.22s]  But you know them.
[543.22s -> 547.27s]  The serpent's weaknesses are the most heavily guarded secrets in the whole of Mampang.
[547.27s -> 549.11s]  She replies dramatically before smiling.
[549.11s -> 549.91s]  Of course I know them.
[549.91s -> 551.35s]  Or at least I know of two.
[551.35s -> 553.50s]  Your mom's still on the phone?
[553.50s -> 554.06s]  Oh.
[554.06s -> 555.48s]  All right, ma, I gotta go.
[555.48s -> 558.39s]  You caught up?
[558.39s -> 560.71s]  She said yes with a smiley emoji.
[560.71s -> 561.59s]  All right, perfect.
[561.59s -> 565.75s]  All right, I'll talk to you soon.
[565.75s -> 566.55s]  Okay.
[566.55s -> 568.38s]  Bye, ma.
[568.38s -> 569.85s]  Say hi to dad.
[569.85s -> 571.22s]  Bye, ma.
[571.22s -> 571.72s]  Okay.
[573.98s -> 575.98s]  What else do you know?
[575.98s -> 578.38s]  I know that your lack of gratitude is unbecoming.
[578.46s -> 580.70s]  And I shall transform you into a toad.
[581.83s -> 583.51s]  Tell me of the Sleepless Ram.
[583.51s -> 587.66s]  The Sleepless Ram is in Mampang Fortress, a guardian of the Archmage.
[587.66s -> 589.56s]  All right.
[589.56s -> 590.60s]  It has a weakness.
[590.60s -> 592.52s]  Where can I find the seven serpents?
[592.52s -> 593.08s]  One goes...
[593.08s -> 596.62s]  Okay, one goes off to hide in the waters of Lake Iklala.
[596.62s -> 598.86s]  It means to pick you off as you cross.
[598.86s -> 601.34s]  But it will wait until you are alone.
[601.34s -> 605.02s]  If you travel with the ferrymen, you will most likely be safe.
[605.02s -> 606.30s]  She shakes her head.
[606.30s -> 608.86s]  If that's not any help, I don't suppose it is.
[608.86s -> 611.38s]  What kind of sorceress are you?
[611.38s -> 612.34s]  You ask.
[612.34s -> 613.06s]  A busy one.
[613.62s -> 615.86s]  Why do you waste my time with stupid questions?
[615.86s -> 620.31s]  She turns to leave, begins to weave her spell around herself once more.
[620.31s -> 623.69s]  You waive her away, keen to continue your journey.
[623.69s -> 625.93s]  Dentainte becomes an ugly creature once more.
[625.93s -> 630.73s]  And a moment later, she whisks herself away across the plains and is gone.
[630.73s -> 632.49s]  Climb is uneventful and the slopes are silent.
[632.49s -> 634.01s]  You have found three new clues.
[634.01s -> 635.48s]  All right.
[635.48s -> 643.45s]  So we've got further up, we've got across the plain, and then we have downhill.
[644.09s -> 647.53s]  I am going to say, let's go this way.
[647.53s -> 652.87s]  Forest of, we've, we have not, we've explored a lot of this.
[652.87s -> 655.43s]  Some of it in the past, some in the present.
[655.43s -> 660.57s]  But I think it's time to go through the Forest of Snata.
[660.57s -> 663.93s]  So they mean to jump me in Lake Iklala.
[663.93s -> 664.89s]  I need to remember that.
[664.89s -> 667.46s]  Let's go for it.
[667.46s -> 668.34s]  Here we go.
[668.34s -> 669.54s]  Time to begin.
[676.60s -> 680.22s]  You return up the winding path to the top of the mountain.
[680.22s -> 682.30s]  Night falls and you are worn out.
[682.30s -> 684.79s]  You should try to find somewhere safe to sleep.
[684.79s -> 689.43s]  From the top of the mountain, the view across the plains in both directions is gloomy and dark.
[689.43s -> 692.25s]  But you see no way down to the east.
[692.25s -> 695.61s]  There is nowhere on the exposed peak to sleep safely.
[695.61s -> 697.14s]  You must keep walking.
[697.14s -> 698.66s]  Time to head for lower ground.
[698.66s -> 701.21s]  All right.
[701.21s -> 709.43s]  Broken down bridge, down the steps.
[709.43s -> 712.47s]  We can go this way, but no, let's, let's go for it.
[712.47s -> 715.03s]  Okay.
[715.03s -> 717.83s]  You step onto the foot of the ruined bridge and then over.
[718.47s -> 722.23s]  You drop a few feet to the slope below in a controlled fashion.
[722.23s -> 725.83s]  And then you begin to skid, sliding and slipping down the loose stones.
[725.83s -> 730.33s]  You are gathering speed fast.
[730.33s -> 731.45s]  You are falling.
[731.45s -> 737.38s]  Your boots shoot out from underneath you and you skid down the slope on your cloak.
[737.38s -> 739.78s]  Arms out backwards, trying to keep you level.
[739.78s -> 742.50s]  You're about halfway to the thick trees below.
[742.50s -> 745.50s]  Concentrate on balance.
[745.50s -> 748.07s]  Pray to the ape or cast a spell.
[748.07s -> 749.75s]  Keep in mind, this is very important.
[750.47s -> 752.15s]  Mom, I know you're not there anymore, but it's all right.
[753.61s -> 759.30s]  Casting spells costs stamina between one and three.
[759.30s -> 761.54s]  If I cast a spell, I will die.
[762.38s -> 764.38s]  I think we do have to pray to the ape.
[764.38s -> 765.98s]  Let's see if the ape will help us.
[765.98s -> 767.35s]  Pray.
[767.35s -> 771.03s]  To pray, you need to close your eyes despite the rushing wind, the scattering stones,
[771.03s -> 775.99s]  the sudden precipices that come and go.
[775.99s -> 776.95s]  Close my eyes.
[776.95s -> 781.80s]  Despite the skidding rocks, you close your eyes and begin to raise a prayer to the ape.
[781.80s -> 785.64s]  You feel the stones either side slowing themselves, just a little.
[785.64s -> 791.21s]  From a blur to a mere streak, the canopy approaches at speed.
[791.21s -> 797.82s]  I think it worked.
[797.82s -> 807.70s]  You hit the ground slowly and cannot help but give thanks to the ape for your salvation.
[808.18s -> 810.10s]  I would pray for healing right now, but I want to keep.
[813.48s -> 816.76s]  If you pray for healing, they'll go away for an extended period.
[816.76s -> 820.30s]  It's kind of like a oh shit button.
[820.30s -> 821.18s]  Sometimes it doesn't work.
[821.18s -> 822.06s]  That's actually surprising.
[822.06s -> 824.97s]  That's good that it worked.
[824.97s -> 827.66s]  All right, let's look back.
[827.66s -> 830.46s]  You cast a look back at the mountain slope, but it is all but sheer.
[831.02s -> 832.78s]  There's no way to climb it again.
[832.78s -> 834.46s]  You'll have to move onwards.
[834.46s -> 837.18s]  You pick yourself to your feet.
[837.18s -> 840.22s]  You're on the edge of the thick trees with no discernible path forward.
[840.22s -> 842.70s]  You'll have to fight through the trees as best as you can.
[844.55s -> 845.75s]  All right, so here we are.
[845.75s -> 848.47s]  I guess we're going to keep heading this way.
[851.13s -> 853.05s]  You barge your way through thick trees.
[854.17s -> 858.33s]  Can you guys hear the background music?
[858.33s -> 859.53s]  Pretty sick desktop reveal.
[861.74s -> 862.86s]  Default windows, Andy.
[866.62s -> 869.69s]  Okay, nice wallpaper.
[870.79s -> 871.83s]  I hear, yeah, I hear it.
[873.05s -> 875.37s]  Just the music gets a little loud, so just keep that in mind.
[875.37s -> 877.45s]  I guess the mixing is a little off.
[880.07s -> 882.47s]  Nice wallpaper, default windows wallpaper.
[886.02s -> 887.94s]  Tell that wallpaper story again.
[887.94s -> 891.06s]  What, that I just don't, I just make it something and don't use it?
[891.06s -> 892.10s]  I don't change it ever again.
[893.56s -> 895.96s]  All right, you barge your way through the thick trees, pushing branches from your face.
[895.96s -> 898.04s]  Things chitter in the leaves all around.
[898.04s -> 900.28s]  All right, I'm going to keep moving.
[900.28s -> 902.79s]  You crash on through the thick foliage.
[902.79s -> 905.50s]  Only one way to go.
[909.43s -> 915.27s]  You erupt from the trees onto an old path that winds a narrow course through the forest.
[915.27s -> 917.91s]  The trees loom around you, twisted and old.
[917.91s -> 922.26s]  You explored the forest in the Xumantanti Hills when you met Aliana,
[922.26s -> 925.78s]  but that was a mere copse in comparison to this.
[925.78s -> 928.92s]  The forest is ancient.
[928.92s -> 932.12s]  The forest of Snata is ancient and it is a maze.
[932.98s -> 936.18s]  There are no roads through it, only twisted paths and dead ends.
[936.18s -> 938.94s]  But who knows what secrets it may hide.
[938.94s -> 943.74s]  The forest by night is a terrifying place full of strange noises and shifting shadows.
[943.74s -> 951.69s]  You are certain something is following you, but when you turn, there is nothing there.
[951.69s -> 952.81s]  I've played this game before.
[953.37s -> 954.81s]  I know what it is.
[954.81s -> 955.93s]  I know what it is.
[955.93s -> 958.25s]  I think.
[958.25s -> 961.21s]  Uh, I think I need to do this though, but do I have enough?
[961.21s -> 965.43s]  Do I have any healing potions?
[969.02s -> 971.10s]  We still, oh, we have a lot of goblin teeth, giant teeth.
[971.10s -> 972.94s]  We have a lot of the good magic items.
[973.50s -> 978.38s]  So most of the spells in the game you cannot cast unless you have a magical item.
[979.51s -> 982.87s]  These are kind of hard to come by and we did a really good job.
[983.51s -> 995.18s]  But I don't think I have any, how many heals do I?
[995.90s -> 1001.67s]  I need to cook.
[1007.14s -> 1008.50s]  Tell the orchestra to stop.
[1010.90s -> 1014.26s]  That's what I mean by the mixing and the audio mixing is a little off
[1014.26s -> 1015.78s]  because the music is fantastic.
[1016.50s -> 1020.95s]  But if I lower this, then everything else will be lower.
[1021.75s -> 1022.57s]  It's all right.
[1022.57s -> 1023.93s]  It's it's and it's beautiful.
[1023.93s -> 1025.21s]  We're going to keep going.
[1025.21s -> 1030.17s]  All right, we're going for it.
[1030.17s -> 1033.32s]  This is going to be loud.
[1034.84s -> 1036.20s]  That part always is.
[1036.20s -> 1037.08s]  Just keep that in mind.
[1040.04s -> 1044.63s]  All right, we can do Yaz, which is cause invisibility.
[1048.55s -> 1051.99s]  We can do all which is floating the air.
[1051.99s -> 1053.35s]  However, I think something's behind me.
[1058.42s -> 1062.31s]  There is obviously sus, which is sense danger.
[1063.35s -> 1064.95s]  The sun would just create light.
[1065.75s -> 1068.90s]  I think we have to do it just because, right?
[1069.54s -> 1075.45s]  You cast the enchantment and a calm voice begins to speak to you.
[1076.70s -> 1079.42s]  This part of the forest is thick with snattercats.
[1080.41s -> 1082.97s]  They're invisible unless they have their eyes open.
[1083.61s -> 1086.58s]  Their sense of smell is good enough to track you down.
[1087.38s -> 1094.98s]  I think we keep moving.
[1095.78s -> 1096.58s]  I have two health.
[1097.30s -> 1103.10s]  You pick up your pace if you walk for long enough after all the sun will rise.
[1103.66s -> 1107.53s]  It's decision time.
[1108.33s -> 1109.26s]  Where are we going?
[1110.34s -> 1110.74s]  VODs?
[1111.46s -> 1114.14s]  Put a two-minute poll up.
[1114.14s -> 1116.94s]  Are we going east or are we going south?
[1118.60s -> 1122.44s]  Very different directions considering this is going to have us go all over here.
[1123.00s -> 1125.00s]  This one's going to have us go all over here.
[1125.00s -> 1126.76s]  Keep in mind this is very important.
[1127.93s -> 1130.17s]  How many choices are in the game really?
[1130.17s -> 1131.93s]  A fuckload.
[1133.42s -> 1136.78s]  A shitload.
[1136.78s -> 1141.67s]  So it's not like, oh, okay, this probably all connects to the same thing.
[1142.74s -> 1143.22s]  A lot.
[1143.86s -> 1154.39s]  That doesn't mean you can swear.
[1155.54s -> 1158.18s]  Oh yeah, when we play sorcery I gotta go PG-13 mode.
[1158.18s -> 1158.68s]  You're right.
[1159.22s -> 1164.15s]  Pretty much 50-50.
[1166.02s -> 1168.50s]  Every time I click out of here you're going to see my background but it's all right.
[1169.14s -> 1171.82s]  It is 50-50.
[1172.54s -> 1174.62s]  That means it's streamer's choice by the way.
[1181.45s -> 1183.29s]  50-50 is streamer's choice.
[1183.29s -> 1195.77s]  The game is like Elden Ring but you're not allowed to leave the map screen.
[1195.77s -> 1197.69s]  Time that person out for six or seven months.
[1211.13s -> 1212.97s]  All right, where are we going?
[1212.97s -> 1216.18s]  Maybe we'll make all the polls 60 seconds.
[1216.18s -> 1219.83s]  We're not going to do a poll for every single choice.
[1219.83s -> 1222.55s]  I'm just, you know, showing that sometimes we do it.
[1225.82s -> 1228.06s]  You ever beat this one the tryhard way?
[1229.86s -> 1233.14s]  No, every time I've ever played sorcery again I kind of just casually play it.
[1233.14s -> 1235.62s]  I don't ever do any like the meta or like...
[1236.78s -> 1238.78s]  I know there's a way you can get them all pretty quickly.
[1239.72s -> 1240.84s]  Is it still 50-50?
[1242.36s -> 1243.88s]  Well, something has to win.
[1243.88s -> 1247.24s]  There's no such thing as a tie on this switch poll.
[1247.88s -> 1251.13s]  Which way?
[1251.13s -> 1252.26s]  Okay, south it is.
[1252.82s -> 1253.46s]  Thanks for playing.
[1257.16s -> 1258.36s]  You walk on between the trees.
[1258.36s -> 1260.04s]  The dead of night is still in cold.
[1260.76s -> 1262.44s]  Something prowls close at hand.
[1263.16s -> 1267.00s]  Suddenly you catch a pair of eyes in a low bush.
[1269.43s -> 1270.23s]  Look at the eyes.
[1270.23s -> 1270.79s]  Oh, all right.
[1270.79s -> 1272.31s]  This is a snatacat.
[1272.31s -> 1276.63s]  I think we need to just...
[1277.35s -> 1277.83s]  I don't know.
[1278.39s -> 1278.95s]  I'm going to look.
[1279.67s -> 1285.93s]  The artwork is amazing in this, by the way.
[1285.93s -> 1286.49s]  They pull it.
[1286.49s -> 1288.09s]  Essentially, they rip it right from the books.
[1292.36s -> 1296.68s]  The eyes are narrow with thin vertical pupils and orange irises.
[1297.24s -> 1300.92s]  A moment later, another pair of eyes appear followed slowly by a body.
[1301.64s -> 1304.44s]  These creatures are becoming visible as you watch.
[1305.24s -> 1307.24s]  These must be snatacats.
[1307.24s -> 1312.52s]  There they are.
[1313.83s -> 1314.63s]  Look at them.
[1314.63s -> 1315.19s]  Keep walking.
[1315.19s -> 1315.43s]  All right.
[1315.43s -> 1316.95s]  What if I just keep looking at them?
[1316.95s -> 1320.98s]  I'm going to look at them more.
[1321.78s -> 1327.62s]  They are both the size of a large dog with ugly snub noses.
[1328.26s -> 1331.78s]  Their black fur is trimmed with yellow flashes.
[1331.78s -> 1336.81s]  One of the creatures steps out of the bushes to stand in front of you, then vanishes.
[1336.81s -> 1338.50s]  Oh, shit.
[1340.02s -> 1340.74s]  Maybe just listen.
[1343.35s -> 1343.99s]  You listen.
[1344.55s -> 1348.74s]  Footsteps across the leaves and branches cannot be disguised.
[1348.74s -> 1357.45s]  The cats are pacing towards you.
[1357.45s -> 1357.95s]  Wow.
[1358.33s -> 1360.07s]  What can I do here?
[1362.57s -> 1363.07s]  Rock.
[1363.93s -> 1364.97s]  Turn to stone.
[1365.53s -> 1366.65s]  I don't have any stone dust.
[1371.46s -> 1371.96s]  Gob.
[1372.26s -> 1373.06s]  So I'm on a goblin.
[1374.10s -> 1375.86s]  This is free, by the way.
[1376.50s -> 1377.78s]  This does not cost stamina.
[1378.42s -> 1380.42s]  We might get a goblin friend to come help us.
[1382.63s -> 1384.23s]  Gack is cause fear.
[1384.23s -> 1385.35s]  I don't have the face mask.
[1389.08s -> 1390.20s]  Gum is glue.
[1390.20s -> 1391.48s]  I don't have glue.
[1391.48s -> 1392.92s]  I think we have to have a goblin come out.
[1393.24s -> 1394.28s]  It's free and I only have two.
[1395.08s -> 1396.68s]  Yeah, all these are going to cost at least one.
[1397.40s -> 1398.20s]  This one's three.
[1398.20s -> 1399.88s]  Yeah, let's see what a goblin is going to do here.
[1400.84s -> 1402.44s]  I have five goblin teeth, so we're good.
[1402.44s -> 1403.48s]  Let's let it roll.
[1407.13s -> 1411.45s]  You pull a goblin tooth from your pack and drop it on the ground, casting your spell across it.
[1411.45s -> 1416.09s]  The tooth erupts into a column of smoke and a moment later, a goblin warrior is standing in
[1416.09s -> 1417.78s]  front of you.
[1417.78s -> 1421.38s]  Order the goblin to attack or hide behind the goblin.
[1423.59s -> 1425.35s]  Attack!
[1425.35s -> 1428.55s]  You direct the goblin forward, ordering it to draw its sword.
[1428.55s -> 1432.63s]  But the goblin is stupid and does not realize the Snatacat is even there.
[1433.37s -> 1436.73s]  A moment later, your little champion is dead in the mud.
[1436.73s -> 1439.37s]  Its little throat slit.
[1439.37s -> 1442.33s]  The body disappears in a puff of smoke and you draw your sword.
[1443.53s -> 1444.01s]  I shouldn't.
[1444.57s -> 1445.45s]  Okay, this is bad.
[1448.89s -> 1450.33s]  So there is combat in this game.
[1450.33s -> 1453.85s]  For those of you that need to understand how this works, I will give a very brief overview.
[1455.13s -> 1461.45s]  It's just like bluffing the video game because I have a stamina bar that's nine points.
[1462.09s -> 1464.17s]  Snatacat has a stamina bar that's seven points.
[1464.97s -> 1469.82s]  No, it's also it's probably eight because look at how big it is.
[1471.00s -> 1476.20s]  So how this works is if I hit defend, I won't do anything.
[1477.10s -> 1482.82s]  If this character attacks, I will always take one damage.
[1482.82s -> 1483.22s]  I will.
[1483.22s -> 1484.66s]  Yeah, this is health.
[1484.66s -> 1486.02s]  Stamina is health in this game.
[1486.02s -> 1487.78s]  This is like a different bar.
[1487.78s -> 1490.10s]  So some people's bars are this tall.
[1490.10s -> 1491.46s]  Some people have this big.
[1491.46s -> 1494.15s]  Some people this is going to be hard.
[1494.15s -> 1499.51s]  So again, I have to make sure that if I am going to do this,
[1500.33s -> 1503.29s]  that it will be higher than what they do.
[1503.85s -> 1507.37s]  So if I go, okay, I'm going to go four point one for strength
[1507.37s -> 1512.01s]  and the Snatacat does four point two, I lose and I take damage and it'll kill me
[1512.01s -> 1515.45s]  because it's going to do like three or four damage.
[1515.45s -> 1520.50s]  If I defend, it'll always be one damage I take if they attack two.
[1520.50s -> 1525.40s]  Now, here's a very important thing to realize.
[1525.40s -> 1528.36s]  If I go full blast, it'll be fine.
[1528.92s -> 1537.37s]  But then my bar is zero when the bar, it takes a few turns to recharge this.
[1537.37s -> 1539.37s]  So you can really get yourself in a lot of trouble.
[1541.42s -> 1543.42s]  I'm going to say it's one V one.
[1544.87s -> 1546.31s]  It's going to be I'm going full blast.
[1546.95s -> 1552.47s]  And it was a stupid idea because I just burnt how I almost my whole stamina bar
[1552.47s -> 1555.94s]  and I did nothing because the cat's invisible.
[1561.22s -> 1562.26s]  You can't even see it.
[1564.17s -> 1567.13s]  The Snatacat stares hard at you, then close its eyes and vanishes.
[1567.13s -> 1568.97s]  You take a risk and charge head on.
[1572.14s -> 1574.73s]  Okay, I'm dead in one hit.
[1577.98s -> 1583.26s]  Your caution pays off as the slavering cat appears suddenly diving for your blood.
[1583.26s -> 1585.74s]  Eyes wide open now staring with murderous intent.
[1586.30s -> 1589.02s]  You react on instinct, dodging behind a tree for cover.
[1589.02s -> 1591.37s]  You're shaken, but mostly unharmed.
[1591.37s -> 1593.21s]  The Snatacat closes its eyes once more.
[1593.93s -> 1597.62s]  You see it is tensing, preparing to pounce.
[1597.62s -> 1598.82s]  I got to go full blast on this.
[1599.38s -> 1601.14s]  Yep, got him.
[1601.14s -> 1602.62s]  Good.
[1602.62s -> 1611.13s]  Okay, I am I need to pray to the ape.
[1611.13s -> 1611.69s]  We're good.
[1611.69s -> 1613.37s]  All right, I got five health from that.
[1614.25s -> 1617.13s]  He he's going to go away now, but I prayed to the ape.
[1617.13s -> 1617.77s]  Everything's good.
[1619.26s -> 1619.98s]  I have more health.
[1622.01s -> 1624.57s]  If something bad happens later, then that's just the way it is.
[1624.57s -> 1625.53s]  All right, what did he do last?
[1626.09s -> 1626.65s]  Like four.
[1627.21s -> 1629.40s]  How much bar does he have?
[1629.40s -> 1629.88s]  I'm going.
[1631.10s -> 1635.38s]  Okay, this is going to be a huge full bar attack.
[1636.02s -> 1639.61s]  Snatacat does not reappear and your blade finds only empty air.
[1639.61s -> 1640.41s]  All right, now I defend.
[1641.34s -> 1642.22s]  Oh, okay.
[1644.82s -> 1645.70s]  Nothing else happens.
[1645.70s -> 1648.10s]  You wait, eyes fixed on the empty air again.
[1648.74s -> 1648.98s]  Yep.
[1649.70s -> 1655.21s]  Okay, Snatacat runs for your throat.
[1655.21s -> 1659.78s]  Quick as a flash, you leap out of the way, but you cannot defend forever.
[1659.78s -> 1662.26s]  All right, Snatacat just use full stamina bar.
[1662.90s -> 1665.26s]  I'm going to defend.
[1665.82s -> 1670.73s]  You stay crouched.
[1671.37s -> 1673.05s]  You sense the Snatacat prowling.
[1673.05s -> 1674.41s]  It is somewhere very close.
[1674.41s -> 1676.65s]  You can almost feel its hot, wet breath.
[1677.21s -> 1678.95s]  You think it appears?
[1679.91s -> 1681.19s]  I'm going, I'm going all in.
[1683.67s -> 1688.90s]  Got it.
[1688.90s -> 1691.30s]  You bring all your strength to bear on the creature's hide.
[1691.30s -> 1694.26s]  The Snatacat turns on the spot, prowling the space between you.
[1694.26s -> 1698.07s]  Snatacat fades from view as it turns about on the spot.
[1698.07s -> 1698.79s]  I'm going in again.
[1699.91s -> 1700.47s]  See you later.
[1701.35s -> 1702.31s]  Only one damage?
[1702.31s -> 1702.55s]  What?
[1703.27s -> 1707.91s]  Its fur seems to bristle with electricity.
[1707.91s -> 1710.87s]  You turn your grip about for a wild attack and the blow lands deep.
[1711.74s -> 1717.90s]  Snatacat wails in agony with a keying, keening, almost human sound.
[1717.90s -> 1720.62s]  Do I dare?
[1722.12s -> 1723.16s]  Oh, I did it.
[1723.16s -> 1724.84s]  With .1 damage.
[1725.80s -> 1726.36s]  I got it.
[1726.36s -> 1728.76s]  Nice.
[1728.76s -> 1729.64s]  You risk a swipe.
[1729.64s -> 1731.96s]  Your sword plunges deep into the creature's throat.
[1731.96s -> 1736.12s]  It drops to the ground and those delicate, powerful eyelids close.
[1736.68s -> 1737.85s]  Continue.
[1738.41s -> 1743.42s]  The other Snatacats prowl closer, slowly circling around you.
[1743.42s -> 1748.15s]  Uh-oh, do I got to do this a few times?
[1748.15s -> 1751.03s]  Do I continue or do I fight or do I just try to get out?
[1751.03s -> 1752.81s]  Fight the next one.
[1752.81s -> 1753.21s]  Let's go.
[1755.42s -> 1757.98s]  You pick the next closest creature and ready your attack.
[1758.54s -> 1761.02s]  The remaining Snatacats look between each other.
[1761.02s -> 1763.19s]  Then close their eyes and vanish from view.
[1763.19s -> 1765.83s]  The leaves rustle as they disappear into the trees.
[1767.29s -> 1768.89s]  Oh, cowards.
[1768.89s -> 1772.34s]  Pry loose the dead cat's teeth.
[1773.14s -> 1775.14s]  Yeah, this is probably going to be magical items here.
[1775.14s -> 1780.06s]  Working with the tip of your blade, you pry free the creature's front two incisor teeth.
[1780.06s -> 1784.71s]  It's bloody work and once done, that grass underfoot is sodden.
[1784.71s -> 1786.31s]  Then there's nothing more to do.
[1786.31s -> 1789.51s]  You walk away, wiping invisible blood from your blade.
[1789.51s -> 1793.27s]  Something massive looms between the trees south of here.
[1793.27s -> 1796.60s]  You must continue your journey.
[1796.60s -> 1798.76s]  But you are weaker than you realize.
[1798.76s -> 1804.87s]  Perhaps you should simply rest here for a few hours and regain some strength.
[1804.87s -> 1805.51s]  Yeah.
[1805.51s -> 1813.18s]  Gratefully, you seat yourself and enter the meditative state taught to you by your masters.
[1813.18s -> 1817.18s]  A sensation of great peace enters your body.
[1817.18s -> 1817.90s]  Hours pass.
[1819.08s -> 1821.32s]  In the distance, the sun breaks over the horizon.
[1821.32s -> 1824.36s]  You've been awake all night and are weaker for it.
[1824.36s -> 1829.30s]  You stand once more.
[1829.30s -> 1830.58s]  Day eight in the forest.
[1830.58s -> 1832.42s]  During the past day, you reached the forest of Snata
[1832.42s -> 1835.46s]  and you defeated the moon serpent, the first of the seven serpents.
[1835.46s -> 1837.82s]  We did beat the moon serpent.
[1838.70s -> 1842.78s]  Did it take my stamina away?
[1843.50s -> 1845.10s]  All right, well, obviously we're going to keep going south.
[1845.10s -> 1846.46s]  We're not going to go back up that way.
[1846.46s -> 1851.72s]  You follow what might be a path and it might be an old river
[1851.72s -> 1853.08s]  through the trees of the forest.
[1853.08s -> 1855.96s]  As the morning moves on, the wind begins to rise.
[1855.96s -> 1860.07s]  You are standing in the shadow of some colossal stone structure
[1860.07s -> 1863.18s]  that rises up from the trees and disappears into the clouds.
[1863.18s -> 1864.54s]  You stride forward.
[1864.54s -> 1869.43s]  You must reach Iklala and the road to lower Zamen.
[1869.43s -> 1871.27s]  Every passing day brings danger.
[1871.27s -> 1880.66s]  That bird is fucking loud.
[1883.05s -> 1885.30s]  Things rustle in the branches all around.
[1885.30s -> 1889.38s]  As the sun climbs towards its zenith, the wind picks up.
[1889.38s -> 1893.80s]  You emerge into something of a clearing with a stone pillar at its heart.
[1893.80s -> 1896.36s]  Not a tower, but one leg of an enormous arch.
[1896.36s -> 1899.40s]  Who could have built such an incredible thing?
[1899.40s -> 1901.00s]  And how long ago was it done?
[1901.00s -> 1913.86s]  The trees are thinner, replaced by climbing weeds and shrubs
[1913.86s -> 1916.42s]  that grow in and around the broken stones of the bridge.
[1916.42s -> 1920.41s]  You make your way to a point where the path splits.
[1920.41s -> 1921.53s]  Look up at the arch.
[1921.53s -> 1925.00s]  You crane your neck back to look at the stone pillar.
[1925.00s -> 1929.64s]  Made of bricks, each one of a normal size, but thousands upon thousands in number.
[1929.64s -> 1933.21s]  They climb up into the air and a stack, no wider than a tree,
[1933.21s -> 1937.59s]  but three times taller than the tallest in the forest.
[1937.59s -> 1940.20s]  Look higher.
[1940.20s -> 1945.16s]  Then, almost beyond what you can see, the stone begins to form a curve,
[1945.16s -> 1946.84s]  branching into the beginning of an arch.
[1946.84s -> 1949.56s]  But the rest of the arch has crumbled into ruin,
[1949.56s -> 1952.23s]  and this single leg is all that remains.
[1952.23s -> 1958.87s]  The pillar might be climbable, otherwise several paths lead into the trees.
[1958.87s -> 1961.40s]  All right, this is where it's going to get funky.
[1964.20s -> 1967.37s]  We're not leaving.
[1967.37s -> 1968.41s]  Climb the pillar.
[1968.41s -> 1969.61s]  But what is that going to put us?
[1969.61s -> 1973.74s]  So we started here.
[1973.74s -> 1974.94s]  We couldn't go across.
[1974.94s -> 1976.87s]  This will get us on the top of the bridge.
[1976.87s -> 1981.02s]  Is there anything on the top of the bridge that's important?
[1981.02s -> 1983.66s]  Or do we just simply go down here?
[1983.66s -> 1989.26s]  Pray to the ape.
[1989.26s -> 1990.30s]  I can't, I already did.
[1992.49s -> 1996.98s]  Yeah, whatever, let's climb it.
[1996.98s -> 2001.14s]  Intrigued, you approach one of the brick pillars to see if it might be climbable.
[2001.14s -> 2005.38s]  Indeed, the stones are worn and filled with pock-marked holes and finger grips.
[2005.38s -> 2009.61s]  But you cannot seem to manage the climb up while holding your sword.
[2009.61s -> 2013.45s]  You will have to unbuckle your blade if you want to climb up.
[2013.45s -> 2016.42s]  What do I have for a weapon?
[2016.42s -> 2019.21s]  Because if I lose this, I'm going to be fucking really mad.
[2019.21s -> 2024.87s]  Okay, I have a hewing axe.
[2024.87s -> 2033.24s]  I don't want to lose any items.
[2033.24s -> 2043.10s]  Sorry, it's just a generic sword.
[2043.10s -> 2045.56s]  I think the axe is the more important one, though.
[2045.56s -> 2048.30s]  All right, let's go.
[2048.30s -> 2051.59s]  Fine.
[2051.59s -> 2056.15s]  You unbuckle your weapon and leave them in a tidy pile at the foot of the pillar,
[2056.15s -> 2058.39s]  covering them up with large leaves.
[2058.39s -> 2060.09s]  Then you begin to climb.
[2060.09s -> 2063.18s]  The going is tough, and once you start,
[2063.26s -> 2066.62s]  you begin to understand quite how tall the stone pillar is.
[2066.62s -> 2071.05s]  You've barely reached the forest canopy when you need to stop for breath.
[2071.05s -> 2074.73s]  And at the same time, you are not even a third of the way to the top of the arch.
[2074.73s -> 2077.38s]  I have an opportunity to stop doing this.
[2081.38s -> 2082.58s]  We don't have the ape anymore.
[2082.58s -> 2085.83s]  Keep that in mind.
[2085.83s -> 2086.55s]  You keep climbing.
[2086.55s -> 2090.76s]  After five more minutes, your arms are aching with the effort.
[2090.76s -> 2093.96s]  But you have an incredible view across the forest.
[2093.96s -> 2097.88s]  It fills this basin from the mountains in the east to those in the west.
[2097.88s -> 2101.80s]  Its canopy is so tightly self-entwined, it is almost like a sea.
[2101.80s -> 2104.90s]  The top of the bridge is still some distance above you.
[2104.90s -> 2113.40s]  Okay.
[2113.40s -> 2117.24s]  You climb even higher until your arms begin to scream with pain.
[2117.24s -> 2122.89s]  You are so high up now that to drop would not simply be fatal.
[2122.89s -> 2126.71s]  It would be enough to bury you six feet into the earth.
[2126.71s -> 2131.11s]  Before your arms give out, you swing yourself into one of the bridge's levels to rest.
[2131.11s -> 2135.51s]  Some wily coyote shit.
[2135.51s -> 2136.71s]  I'm losing stamina, too.
[2136.71s -> 2137.59s]  That's not good.
[2137.59s -> 2138.15s]  All right, rest.
[2140.50s -> 2144.18s]  This is a lower roadway, one layer down from the top of the bridge.
[2144.18s -> 2150.42s]  Perhaps this was used for servants or goods trucks when the road above was for nobles.
[2150.42s -> 2155.14s]  At any rate, there seems to be no stairs or ramps to the higher level,
[2155.14s -> 2163.85s]  but the view is incredible through the bridge.
[2163.85s -> 2167.29s]  You pause to admire the arches holding up the layer above.
[2167.29s -> 2171.66s]  Graceful giant stones stacked with unearing precision.
[2171.66s -> 2175.78s]  Whoever built this must have been three times the size of the largest hill giant,
[2175.78s -> 2179.08s]  and yet as dexterous as a weaver.
[2179.08s -> 2181.56s]  Scratched into the stone, you see a small insignia.
[2181.56s -> 2191.21s]  The wind blasts through the arches for a moment, making a fluting, moaning sound.
[2191.21s -> 2192.70s]  Whoa.
[2192.70s -> 2193.10s]  Looking...
[2194.22s -> 2201.35s]  Okay, what does it say?
[2204.14s -> 2207.34s]  The emblem forms the shape of a jagged peak.
[2207.34s -> 2209.66s]  You recognize it, of course, from your training.
[2209.66s -> 2217.24s]  It is the jagged rocks of High Xamen, on which stands the fortress of the archmage.
[2217.24s -> 2219.96s]  These stones were set by Xamen magic then.
[2219.96s -> 2225.24s]  It is said the archmage is old, but surely not so old as to have overseen this.
[2225.24s -> 2227.80s]  Something rustles in the weeds nearby.
[2228.76s -> 2231.82s]  Watch out the weeds!
[2231.82s -> 2233.74s]  You approach the bushes, then freeze.
[2233.74s -> 2235.58s]  A pair of eyes is staring back.
[2235.58s -> 2236.08s]  Uh-oh.
[2242.76s -> 2247.54s]  Jump off the bridge?
[2247.54s -> 2248.18s]  But what if it...
[2248.18s -> 2250.10s]  Okay, what if it's not a snatacat?
[2250.10s -> 2255.11s]  Jump off the bridge, I dare you.
[2255.11s -> 2256.23s]  You are trapped up here.
[2256.23s -> 2257.83s]  No way to escape and no way to fight.
[2257.83s -> 2259.90s]  There is little choice but to jump.
[2259.90s -> 2264.44s]  So without thinking too hard, you turn and fling yourself over the side.
[2264.44s -> 2266.04s]  It is a long way to fall.
[2273.61s -> 2276.89s]  You hit the ground with a neck-twisting thump.
[2276.89s -> 2278.49s]  You have fallen to your death.
[2278.49s -> 2279.21s]  Game over.
[2279.21s -> 2287.56s]  All right, that was for fun.
[2287.56s -> 2288.84s]  That was for a joke.
[2288.84s -> 2291.16s]  We go back.
[2291.16s -> 2298.47s]  We're going back.
[2298.47s -> 2303.58s]  There is a rewind feature.
[2303.58s -> 2304.46s]  No rewinds.
[2304.46s -> 2305.58s]  Yeah, we...
[2305.58s -> 2307.48s]  Okay.
[2307.48s -> 2309.74s]  What's the rule for this playthrough here?
[2309.74s -> 2310.22s]  I forgot.
[2310.22s -> 2314.26s]  I think it was three.
[2314.26s -> 2315.54s]  Three per stream, right?
[2315.54s -> 2320.25s]  It doesn't matter.
[2320.25s -> 2321.61s]  All right, so let's get back to where we were.
[2321.61s -> 2323.93s]  It was, uh, I searched the weeds.
[2323.93s -> 2326.50s]  There's a pair of eyes staring back.
[2326.50s -> 2327.54s]  But what kind of eyes?
[2327.54s -> 2328.50s]  Do I know?
[2328.50s -> 2331.06s]  A pair of eyes is staring back.
[2331.06s -> 2332.18s]  This could be a person.
[2332.18s -> 2333.70s]  This could be a different animal.
[2333.70s -> 2336.54s]  I'm gonna listen.
[2336.54s -> 2338.23s]  You've listened intently.
[2338.23s -> 2340.31s]  Something is crawling on its belly
[2340.31s -> 2342.46s]  towards trying to stay hidden.
[2342.46s -> 2343.50s]  Whatever is lurking there,
[2343.50s -> 2352.82s]  it is crawling closer.
[2352.82s -> 2356.73s]  Yeah, probably a snake.
[2356.73s -> 2363.59s]  Curious.
[2363.59s -> 2367.18s]  Mud.
[2367.18s -> 2370.41s]  I could throw a fireball in there.
[2370.41s -> 2372.41s]  I could just whip a fireball in there.
[2372.41s -> 2376.47s]  But I don't know what it is.
[2376.47s -> 2381.42s]  Uh, walk is shield.
[2381.42s -> 2383.02s]  Wall, I believe it's wall,
[2383.02s -> 2384.70s]  is create an invisible wall.
[2384.70s -> 2385.98s]  Too much stamina.
[2393.18s -> 2397.43s]  Float in the air.
[2397.43s -> 2398.39s]  Shield is probably good.
[2398.39s -> 2402.54s]  Yeah, walk is only one.
[2402.54s -> 2404.22s]  But it does require something, doesn't it?
[2405.10s -> 2406.94s]  Requires one stamina and one gold piece.
[2407.66s -> 2409.99s]  Yeah, let's do it.
[2409.99s -> 2413.42s]  You place a gold piece on your-
[2413.42s -> 2414.46s]  I have 28 gold.
[2414.46s -> 2414.94s]  Money, money.
[2414.94s -> 2417.24s]  You place a gold piece on your wrist and cast a spell.
[2417.24s -> 2419.00s]  And a moment later, the coin is gone.
[2419.00s -> 2422.28s]  You feel the weight of an invisible shield on your arm.
[2422.28s -> 2424.28s]  At least you will be somewhat defended.
[2424.28s -> 2431.45s]  The shape moves nearer still.
[2431.45s -> 2433.05s]  You go over to the bushes
[2433.05s -> 2435.40s]  and spread them apart with one arm.
[2435.40s -> 2437.88s]  Lying, a shadow inside shadow
[2438.44s -> 2441.42s]  is a human figure on its front.
[2441.42s -> 2443.34s]  It looks up at you with eyes just visible
[2443.34s -> 2447.43s]  through a cloth mask.
[2447.43s -> 2450.94s]  Now there is a face I have not forgotten.
[2460.06s -> 2460.54s]  I almost-
[2461.18s -> 2461.66s]  That's not-
[2462.70s -> 2465.99s]  It's Flanker!
[2465.99s -> 2468.15s]  You stare in surprise, it's Flanker.
[2468.15s -> 2469.02s]  The assas-
[2469.02s -> 2470.38s]  Okay, we almost killed Flanker.
[2470.38s -> 2471.74s]  I almost threw a fireball at him.
[2471.74s -> 2474.79s]  The assassin jumps ably to his feet
[2474.79s -> 2476.47s]  and then brushes himself down.
[2476.47s -> 2479.70s]  Well met.
[2479.70s -> 2480.90s]  Okay, we need some context.
[2480.90s -> 2481.46s]  All right.
[2481.46s -> 2484.47s]  Flanker is an assassin
[2484.47s -> 2486.23s]  who tried to kill us in the first game.
[2486.23s -> 2488.07s]  Spoilers, go watch or go play.
[2488.07s -> 2488.89s]  It's a-
[2488.89s -> 2489.53s]  Go play it.
[2489.53s -> 2490.81s]  Don't even watch it.
[2490.97s -> 2492.25s]  Go-
[2492.25s -> 2495.05s]  Go buy this whole series
[2495.05s -> 2498.81s]  and just get a cup of fucking cocoa,
[2498.81s -> 2501.90s]  dim the lights a little, and play it.
[2501.90s -> 2502.79s]  It's a-
[2502.79s -> 2506.62s]  It's such a wonderful experience.
[2506.62s -> 2508.47s]  It is so worth it.
[2508.47s -> 2509.03s]  This is-
[2509.03s -> 2511.50s]  People that ask what's your favorite game of all time,
[2511.50s -> 2512.62s]  this is like top five.
[2512.62s -> 2514.86s]  Sorcery, the whole series, is like top five.
[2514.86s -> 2516.46s]  This one and the fourth game
[2516.46s -> 2518.54s]  get kind of really hard and annoying in some places,
[2518.54s -> 2520.22s]  but still I wouldn't take it off that list.
[2523.16s -> 2525.21s]  Sorcery, without a doubt,
[2525.21s -> 2526.41s]  this is probably top five.
[2526.41s -> 2526.91s]  Ever.
[2533.82s -> 2536.06s]  Unreal bad taste.
[2536.06s -> 2540.01s]  Steve Jackson is like the inspiration
[2540.57s -> 2541.93s]  for a shitload of things
[2541.93s -> 2543.69s]  that you probably play right now.
[2543.69s -> 2545.58s]  I'm just telling you,
[2545.58s -> 2548.81s]  Steve Jackson's fantasy book series,
[2549.45s -> 2552.49s]  their road that has been paved,
[2552.49s -> 2553.85s]  he paved the road.
[2553.85s -> 2558.49s]  This shit was made in like the 70s.
[2558.49s -> 2559.05s]  Ban that guy?
[2559.05s -> 2559.77s]  No.
[2559.77s -> 2560.33s]  No.
[2560.33s -> 2561.69s]  We're not going to ban anybody.
[2561.69s -> 2564.42s]  I don't want to ban that person.
[2564.42s -> 2566.97s]  I want that person to say,
[2566.97s -> 2567.77s]  hey, wait a minute.
[2567.77s -> 2569.80s]  Let me give this a chance.
[2569.80s -> 2570.44s]  They're already gone.
[2574.14s -> 2580.18s]  I'm telling you, it's a wonderful franchise.
[2580.18s -> 2581.70s]  No, well, no, I'm not banning for that.
[2581.70s -> 2583.91s]  That's an opinion.
[2583.91s -> 2585.11s]  You think that I have bad taste.
[2585.11s -> 2585.83s]  That's your opinion.
[2585.83s -> 2588.15s]  And that you can have that.
[2588.15s -> 2592.65s]  And I'm going to do some unbearable voice acting.
[2592.65s -> 2596.02s]  So it's actually probably a good thing that you left.
[2596.02s -> 2596.34s]  All right.
[2596.34s -> 2597.30s]  What are you doing here?
[2597.30s -> 2602.76s]  Oh, I'm making my way to High Zamen,
[2602.76s -> 2603.80s]  where I'm needed.
[2603.80s -> 2606.01s]  You can see the wilds of the backlands
[2606.01s -> 2607.37s]  have been harsh on the assassin.
[2607.37s -> 2610.41s]  His eyes burn with a hollow fire.
[2610.41s -> 2617.05s]  How did you get here to this bridge?
[2618.82s -> 2621.51s]  I leapt across the Battleback Gorge.
[2621.51s -> 2623.35s]  I climbed the Battleback Ridge
[2623.35s -> 2626.81s]  and use my climbing hooks to descend into the trees.
[2626.81s -> 2630.17s]  I've killed seven Snattercats before I found this bridge
[2630.17s -> 2632.02s]  in which to shelter.
[2632.02s -> 2634.02s]  How have you made the journey?
[2634.02s -> 2636.44s]  I forget how Jorah Mormont talks.
[2636.44s -> 2639.48s]  It's supposed to be Jorah Mormont
[2639.48s -> 2642.44s]  and it was way better like seven years ago.
[2642.44s -> 2645.83s]  I haven't seen any Game of Thrones in a long time.
[2645.83s -> 2648.89s]  How have you made the journey?
[2650.92s -> 2652.20s]  I'll tell them about the beacons.
[2652.20s -> 2654.98s]  By means of the beacons.
[2654.98s -> 2656.78s]  The beacons?
[2657.29s -> 2659.37s]  You've used all the magic of the Archmage?
[2659.37s -> 2662.26s]  Then no doubt he's sending birdmen
[2662.26s -> 2664.70s]  as we speak to have your head.
[2664.70s -> 2665.98s]  As he speaks, he draws his sword
[2665.98s -> 2669.26s]  and runs two gloved fingertips along its length,
[2669.26s -> 2670.78s]  honing the edge.
[2670.78s -> 2677.75s]  I had no choice.
[2677.75s -> 2681.21s]  There is always a further choice.
[2681.21s -> 2684.73s]  You are reckless, Annalander, and foolish.
[2684.73s -> 2690.01s]  Will you travel with me?
[2690.01s -> 2691.86s]  I will not.
[2691.86s -> 2694.30s]  You are the target of the Archmage.
[2694.30s -> 2698.60s]  You're of the most powerful enemy in the land, Annalander.
[2698.60s -> 2700.57s]  I do not mean to kill you.
[2700.57s -> 2703.13s]  I would have done that in episode one.
[2703.13s -> 2704.73s]  I do not mean you ill,
[2704.73s -> 2709.98s]  but time spent with you is dangerous.
[2709.98s -> 2712.84s]  Help me before you go.
[2712.84s -> 2714.60s]  Remember, you are in my debt.
[2716.74s -> 2719.22s]  In truth, I know something that may be of use.
[2719.22s -> 2722.12s]  A black elf whom I killed for her supplies
[2722.12s -> 2723.88s]  told me that the goddess Throff
[2723.88s -> 2726.90s]  is the mortal enemy of the Earth Serpent
[2726.90s -> 2729.62s]  and can help you defeat him.
[2729.62s -> 2731.62s]  It may be true, it may not be.
[2731.62s -> 2733.00s]  I cannot be sure.
[2733.00s -> 2735.91s]  With a final salute,
[2735.91s -> 2737.75s]  two fingers drawn across the neck
[2737.75s -> 2739.59s]  in the manner of his guild.
[2739.59s -> 2741.83s]  Flanker straps his sword to his back
[2741.83s -> 2744.39s]  and swings himself onto a pillar.
[2744.39s -> 2746.39s]  With enviable speed,
[2746.39s -> 2748.87s]  he scrambles up to the top of the bridge.
[2748.87s -> 2751.48s]  The last you see of him is a figure in black
[2751.48s -> 2756.79s]  leaping away to the east.
[2756.79s -> 2758.23s]  Well, good to see you, Flanker.
[2758.23s -> 2761.88s]  Yeah, Flanker is,
[2761.88s -> 2768.95s]  this game allows you to have a handful of characters
[2768.95s -> 2770.95s]  you can party up with,
[2770.95s -> 2772.95s]  if you want to call it that.
[2772.95s -> 2773.91s]  They all have their own stories,
[2773.91s -> 2775.03s]  they all have their own stuff.
[2775.03s -> 2776.39s]  They all can die.
[2776.39s -> 2778.94s]  They all can die very early.
[2778.94s -> 2781.51s]  It's a wonderful franchise, just try it.
[2781.51s -> 2782.89s]  That's all I'm asking you to do.
[2782.89s -> 2783.45s]  Try it.
[2784.54s -> 2786.38s]  Some of you guys tell me
[2786.38s -> 2787.82s]  that you sit down in the living room
[2787.82s -> 2789.90s]  with your whole family and watch this stream.
[2790.70s -> 2791.18s]  Are you doing,
[2791.18s -> 2792.94s]  whoever's doing that right now,
[2792.94s -> 2794.50s]  turn me off now.
[2794.50s -> 2796.18s]  Go get sorcery.
[2796.18s -> 2796.90s]  And the whole,
[2796.90s -> 2800.55s]  the whole family can do this.
[2800.55s -> 2801.75s]  Sit down with your whole family.
[2802.47s -> 2803.51s]  You do that right now anyways.
[2803.51s -> 2804.87s]  Sit the whole family down.
[2804.87s -> 2808.22s]  Make some muffins.
[2808.22s -> 2809.66s]  All right, let's, let's climb.
[2809.66s -> 2817.00s]  How much is sorcery on Steam?
[2817.00s -> 2819.02s]  I think each episode is like $5.
[2820.78s -> 2826.97s]  Maybe.
[2826.97s -> 2830.25s]  It's like $4 for one of these.
[2830.25s -> 2837.24s]  15 bucks, like 15 for all of them.
[2837.24s -> 2844.76s]  This is like 100 hours worth of content, by the way.
[2844.76s -> 2845.88s]  13 for one and two,
[2845.88s -> 2847.00s]  10 for three,
[2847.00s -> 2848.04s]  and 10 for four.
[2848.04s -> 2853.42s]  27 for all of them is worth it.
[2853.42s -> 2854.78s]  All right, let's, let's, let's,
[2854.78s -> 2856.38s]  let's look down at the forest.
[2856.38s -> 2859.08s]  Let's, let's really take it in.
[2859.08s -> 2860.04s]  Looking down at the forest,
[2860.04s -> 2862.28s]  you can make out a tower through the treetops
[2862.28s -> 2864.14s]  to the southeast.
[2864.14s -> 2865.82s]  Brass shines from its top.
[2865.82s -> 2866.78s]  Looking southwest,
[2866.78s -> 2869.42s]  you see a flash of fire through the trees,
[2869.42s -> 2872.65s]  squirming and moving in a curious way.
[2872.65s -> 2874.17s]  And to the northeast,
[2874.17s -> 2875.93s]  you see curling smoke rising
[2875.93s -> 2877.45s]  as though from a chimney stack,
[2877.45s -> 2879.40s]  though you cannot see a house.
[2879.40s -> 2883.90s]  The giant stone pillars cast long shadows.
[2883.90s -> 2884.46s]  Interesting.
[2884.46s -> 2885.10s]  Let's go.
[2885.10s -> 2887.34s]  You look out at the side of the bridge
[2887.34s -> 2889.02s]  for handholds to the top,
[2889.02s -> 2893.11s]  but can find nothing that looks safe enough.
[2893.11s -> 2894.55s]  It seems this is as high
[2895.11s -> 2898.54s]  as you will be able to climb.
[2898.54s -> 2902.47s]  Oh, maybe I should have casted a spell.
[2902.47s -> 2910.84s]  Float.
[2910.84s -> 2912.44s]  Turning your eyes to the eastern mountains,
[2912.44s -> 2914.76s]  you spy the end of the bridge,
[2914.76s -> 2916.52s]  jutting a short way over the valley.
[2916.52s -> 2917.53s]  And beyond it,
[2917.53s -> 2919.67s]  you catch the flash of water.
[2919.67s -> 2922.23s]  Lake Eclala.
[2922.23s -> 2924.79s]  Somehow, then, you must climb those summits
[2924.79s -> 2927.82s]  if you mean to continue your journey.
[2927.82s -> 2930.06s]  Birds wheel and turn between the stones above.
[2930.06s -> 2932.36s]  You swing yourself back off the bridge,
[2932.36s -> 2933.64s]  onto the pillar.
[2933.64s -> 2934.84s]  Your arms are somewhat rested,
[2934.84s -> 2936.76s]  but quickly start to burn once more.
[2936.76s -> 2944.62s]  You'll have to return quickly to the ground.
[2944.62s -> 2951.45s]  I'm not jumping, right?
[2951.45s -> 2952.65s]  Slowly, painstakingly,
[2952.65s -> 2953.53s]  you make your way back down
[2953.53s -> 2954.49s]  and retrieve your weapon.
[2954.49s -> 2955.77s]  There are several directions
[2955.77s -> 2960.84s]  in which you could continue.
[2960.84s -> 2962.84s]  All right.
[2962.84s -> 2964.28s]  Go through the forest of Snatta.
[2964.28s -> 2968.66s]  We know what is possible there.
[2968.66s -> 2972.42s]  Or head over towards this little pond?
[2972.42s -> 2974.52s]  Lake.
[2974.52s -> 2977.08s]  This also is one of those time travel beams.
[2977.08s -> 2980.39s]  It's going to be able to be aimed
[2980.39s -> 2982.39s]  like this pretty much in any direction.
[2982.39s -> 2984.46s]  I think if it were me,
[2984.46s -> 2985.42s]  I would want to head over here
[2985.42s -> 2986.14s]  and activate this
[2986.14s -> 2987.42s]  because we can probably go back in time
[2987.42s -> 2988.30s]  and fix the bridge.
[2988.30s -> 2995.24s]  I think that's where I'm going.
[2995.24s -> 2996.70s]  Streamer's choice.
[2996.70s -> 3004.70s]  You head away from the bridge
[3004.70s -> 3007.61s]  and into the forest.
[3007.61s -> 3008.33s]  Very cool.
[3008.33s -> 3013.38s]  The path winds torturously through the forest.
[3013.38s -> 3015.46s]  Your shield shimmers out of existence.
[3015.46s -> 3016.66s]  Oh, I still had the shield.
[3018.28s -> 3018.92s]  Oh, all right.
[3018.92s -> 3020.01s]  Okay.
[3020.01s -> 3022.49s]  The sun has reached its highest point now.
[3022.49s -> 3025.66s]  The hot sun is shaded by the trees all around.
[3025.66s -> 3028.94s]  The smell of rotting leaf mulch fills your nostrils.
[3028.94s -> 3037.93s]  I think I want to turn this on.
[3037.93s -> 3041.21s]  Oh, we can see the movements.
[3041.21s -> 3042.89s]  We know where you are.
[3042.89s -> 3045.10s]  As Flanka told us,
[3045.10s -> 3047.80s]  we know where you are.
[3047.80s -> 3050.34s]  Yeah, I'm going easy.
[3050.34s -> 3057.72s]  You walk on between the trees.
[3057.72s -> 3059.56s]  The afternoon is starting to draw on.
[3059.56s -> 3061.99s]  The forest path curves past the shore
[3061.99s -> 3064.38s]  of a deep, flat pool.
[3064.38s -> 3066.57s]  Forage for food.
[3066.57s -> 3067.61s]  Look across the water.
[3067.61s -> 3068.89s]  Cast a spell.
[3068.89s -> 3069.69s]  Make a move.
[3069.69s -> 3071.22s]  Forage for food.
[3071.22s -> 3073.38s]  You take a moment to forage
[3073.38s -> 3075.86s]  through the nearby bushes for edible-looking plants.
[3075.86s -> 3079.61s]  You find a couple of mushrooms and a handful of nuts.
[3079.61s -> 3081.45s]  Take the nuts or try a mushroom.
[3081.45s -> 3082.81s]  This is going to be drugs.
[3082.81s -> 3095.93s]  And I'm going to like fucking pass out into the water.
[3095.93s -> 3098.49s]  You tear off one corner of the mushroom
[3098.49s -> 3099.77s]  and put it into your tongue.
[3099.77s -> 3101.69s]  It tastes well enough.
[3101.69s -> 3107.32s]  You stuff the rest of the mushroom into your mouth.
[3107.32s -> 3108.04s]  A moment later,
[3108.04s -> 3109.80s]  you find the corners of your vision
[3109.80s -> 3111.88s]  are popping and discoloring.
[3111.88s -> 3113.08s]  It must be tiredness.
[3114.39s -> 3117.75s]  Drink some water out of the pond.
[3117.75s -> 3119.75s]  You go to drink some water and collapse.
[3123.93s -> 3125.61s]  I just said it was going to happen.
[3126.41s -> 3128.17s]  Why did I do that?
[3128.17s -> 3131.61s]  You go to drink some water and collapse face down in the pool.
[3131.61s -> 3133.61s]  You feel unable to push yourself upright.
[3133.61s -> 3136.09s]  Strange things happen as you begin to drown.
[3137.34s -> 3138.30s]  Loud noises.
[3139.02s -> 3141.50s]  Explosions are going off close by your ears,
[3141.50s -> 3143.58s]  making you jump from side to side.
[3143.58s -> 3146.14s]  The explosions match the rhythm of your heartbeat almost,
[3146.14s -> 3147.82s]  but not quite precisely.
[3147.82s -> 3149.85s]  But that's not all.
[3149.85s -> 3152.25s]  A fat worm made of firecrackers.
[3152.81s -> 3155.13s]  Seems to be crawling out of one of your eyes
[3155.13s -> 3157.93s]  and crossing the bridge of your nose into your other eye.
[3157.93s -> 3161.66s]  It leaves a slime trail of pink fire in its wake.
[3161.66s -> 3163.83s]  You remember your mother,
[3163.83s -> 3166.25s]  but she appears to have been a goldfish.
[3166.25s -> 3171.48s]  Strange, shadowy creatures, bats perhaps,
[3171.48s -> 3173.66s]  have removed the top of your head.
[3173.66s -> 3175.74s]  One by one, they take out your memories,
[3175.74s -> 3178.94s]  polish them, and organize them into a better pattern within your skull.
[3178.94s -> 3181.08s]  Oh, thanks.
[3181.08s -> 3183.29s]  The dreams, paletsons.
[3183.29s -> 3186.34s]  You are overcome by a vision of your future.
[3186.34s -> 3188.06s]  You stand in a clearing,
[3188.31s -> 3190.26s]  halfway up a mountainside.
[3190.26s -> 3192.76s]  In the middle of the clearing is a tombstone.
[3192.76s -> 3195.96s]  You stand beside it with a vial of water in your hand.
[3195.96s -> 3199.11s]  What is happening?
[3199.11s -> 3200.15s]  Look at the vial.
[3200.15s -> 3201.03s]  Pour the water.
[3201.03s -> 3209.26s]  Stand back.
[3209.26s -> 3212.50s]  Look at the vial.
[3212.50s -> 3214.98s]  You look down at the vial to see that it shimmers
[3214.98s -> 3217.14s]  with a strange internal glow.
[3217.14s -> 3220.79s]  Pour it out.
[3220.79s -> 3223.37s]  You pour the water onto the earth,
[3223.37s -> 3225.59s]  and it seeps down through the soil.
[3225.59s -> 3227.75s]  There is magic in the air.
[3227.75s -> 3232.42s]  Suddenly, something punches the earth below where you stand.
[3232.42s -> 3234.01s]  Wait.
[3234.01s -> 3235.32s]  You wait.
[3235.32s -> 3236.44s]  And a moment later,
[3236.44s -> 3238.60s]  a skeletal hand erupts through the soil
[3238.60s -> 3240.44s]  and grabs you around the ankle.
[3240.44s -> 3242.70s]  Something is hauling itself up from the ground,
[3243.26s -> 3245.18s]  using your leg for purchase.
[3245.18s -> 3246.34s]  The vision fades.
[3246.34s -> 3247.14s]  The sun is sinking.
[3247.14s -> 3249.59s]  It will be dark soon.
[3249.59s -> 3253.43s]  My head hurts.
[3253.43s -> 3255.35s]  You stagger up to your feet,
[3255.35s -> 3258.07s]  head beating and stomach feeling wretched.
[3258.07s -> 3262.01s]  To find you have thrown up while you are unconscious.
[3262.01s -> 3265.29s]  Lucky that no animal has been attracted by the smell.
[3265.29s -> 3267.45s]  You quickly bathe your face and hands in the pool
[3267.45s -> 3270.97s]  and get ready to move on,
[3270.97s -> 3277.37s]  growing for content.
[3277.37s -> 3280.22s]  I think I'll take a bite of this weird mushroom.
[3280.22s -> 3281.66s]  My eyes just roll on the back of my head
[3281.66s -> 3283.91s]  and I fall face first into a pond.
[3283.91s -> 3285.46s]  I'm thirsty.
[3285.46s -> 3286.66s]  That was really stupid.
[3286.66s -> 3291.18s]  The water extends away to the southeast
[3291.18s -> 3293.82s]  towards the dark shadows of the next range of mountains.
[3293.82s -> 3295.82s]  It's not quite a lake,
[3295.82s -> 3297.26s]  but large for a pool,
[3297.26s -> 3299.32s]  and who knows how deep it is.
[3299.32s -> 3302.31s]  On the far side, you see another stone tower.
[3302.31s -> 3304.73s]  The ape here.
[3306.46s -> 3307.42s]  The ape is back.
[3307.42s -> 3311.46s]  Good old, good old ape.
[3311.46s -> 3314.47s]  Test the water.
[3314.47s -> 3322.26s]  What do I have access to?
[3322.26s -> 3323.22s]  I'm going to go in that water
[3323.22s -> 3325.06s]  and I'm going to drop a bunch of fucking items.
[3325.06s -> 3326.02s]  I'm going to lose everything.
[3326.02s -> 3331.46s]  This how, find safe passage.
[3331.46s -> 3337.21s]  Maybe it'll give me a good place to go.
[3337.21s -> 3338.09s]  Zen is hover.
[3338.09s -> 3339.29s]  I don't have the item.
[3341.05s -> 3342.65s]  Zip is teleport.
[3342.65s -> 3343.61s]  I don't have the ring.
[3344.25s -> 3345.53s]  By the way, these are all,
[3345.53s -> 3348.86s]  all the games are connected.
[3348.86s -> 3349.82s]  So if you're wondering,
[3349.82s -> 3351.18s]  what do you mean you need to have that item?
[3351.98s -> 3355.10s]  At some point over the first two parts of the campaign,
[3355.66s -> 3357.74s]  you can get this, you know, so lose it too.
[3358.46s -> 3362.74s]  I don't do how.
[3363.38s -> 3364.95s]  How is cheap, right?
[3365.75s -> 3366.39s]  Yeah.
[3366.39s -> 3372.57s]  Looking to the constellations above you craft the spell
[3372.57s -> 3374.73s]  and a quiet voice speaks into your thoughts.
[3375.37s -> 3376.73s]  The voice tells you calmly
[3377.37s -> 3379.53s]  that the water is too deep to walk through
[3380.09s -> 3381.53s]  but could be safely swum.
[3384.36s -> 3386.79s]  Okay, test the water.
[3387.43s -> 3391.21s]  The water must be freezing cold,
[3391.21s -> 3393.53s]  but if you had to swim, you could probably survive it.
[3395.03s -> 3396.31s]  I don't want to lose anything though.
[3396.87s -> 3405.37s]  If I go across this, it's possible I lose items.
[3405.37s -> 3414.18s]  You stride down to the edge of the water,
[3414.18s -> 3416.26s]  take a deep breath and dive in.
[3416.26s -> 3418.68s]  Of course, all your water
[3418.68s -> 3420.76s]  damageable possessions have been ruined.
[3421.69s -> 3424.57s]  Thankfully, the pages of your spell book are protected.
[3424.57s -> 3425.54s]  What does that mean?
[3426.10s -> 3428.54s]  What did I have?
[3429.10s -> 3435.64s]  Did I have anything important that got ruined?
[3436.28s -> 3439.94s]  I don't know.
[3439.94s -> 3451.48s]  I think I have everything still.
[3453.96s -> 3455.40s]  It was, dude, the iPhone.
[3457.32s -> 3467.30s]  I think I'm okay.
[3468.02s -> 3469.30s]  I don't think I lost anything important.
[3479.54s -> 3480.50s]  You swim across the water
[3480.50s -> 3482.42s]  and pull yourself up on the other shore.
[3482.42s -> 3483.86s]  The sun has all but gone.
[3484.42s -> 3485.22s]  Soon it will be dark.
[3486.34s -> 3489.46s]  Nestled in a curve of the eastern cliffs is a stone tower.
[3490.02s -> 3492.82s]  It is heavily overgrown with thorny branches
[3492.82s -> 3496.74s]  and its base is almost obscured by shrubs and tangled weeds.
[3497.22s -> 3502.79s]  Okay, let's take a look.
[3503.43s -> 3504.23s]  Looking up at the tower,
[3504.23s -> 3505.91s]  it looks similar to the others you've seen,
[3505.91s -> 3508.15s]  built from the same giant size blocks of stone.
[3508.71s -> 3511.35s]  The only differences are the tree branches
[3511.35s -> 3514.55s]  that spill out through cracks in the mortar
[3514.55s -> 3516.23s]  and the leaf canopy that erupts from the top.
[3516.79s -> 3519.05s]  Remember that your cigarettes are ruined.
[3519.05s -> 3519.55s]  That's all right.
[3520.75s -> 3522.75s]  Oh, I don't have the ape.
[3522.75s -> 3524.03s]  I don't have very much health,
[3524.03s -> 3525.23s]  so I'm just going to try to go through.
[3526.16s -> 3527.76s]  You heft your hewing axe
[3527.76s -> 3529.36s]  and cleave quickly through the branches
[3529.36s -> 3531.28s]  that surround the base of the tower.
[3531.28s -> 3534.72s]  The axe's keen edge makes short work of the thorns
[3534.72s -> 3537.60s]  and you have soon cut a path to the tower's door.
[3537.60s -> 3538.24s]  Cool.
[3538.24s -> 3542.00s]  Something seems to rustle and move
[3542.00s -> 3543.68s]  just inside the tower door.
[3543.68s -> 3553.79s]  He's finally playing Tears of the Kingdom.
[3554.35s -> 3557.23s]  You step up to the tower door
[3557.23s -> 3560.03s]  and step inside into the shadows
[3560.35s -> 3565.68s]  to be met by a soft, damp smell of the tower.
[3567.60s -> 3570.08s]  You step into the dark interior of the tower.
[3570.94s -> 3572.86s]  Shadows loom from all sides
[3572.86s -> 3574.22s]  and though you can see nothing,
[3574.86s -> 3577.74s]  there is the sense that something dominates the space.
[3585.08s -> 3587.48s]  Feel my way forward or wait for my eyes to adjust.
[3588.81s -> 3591.58s]  Wait.
[3591.58s -> 3592.22s]  You hold back,
[3592.78s -> 3594.06s]  waiting for your eyes to adjust.
[3594.99s -> 3597.07s]  Slowly, details filter in.
[3597.07s -> 3599.39s]  You're standing at the base of a gigantic tree.
[3599.95s -> 3602.35s]  By the girth, it must be at least 500 years old.
[3602.75s -> 3604.81s]  A wooden staircase winds around the trunk
[3604.81s -> 3606.09s]  and disappears into the canopy.
[3607.96s -> 3610.86s]  The tree is wider than your outstretched arms
[3610.86s -> 3613.50s]  and has thick branches and leaves despite the dark.
[3613.50s -> 3616.96s]  Somewhere up above, used by a metallic glint.
[3616.96s -> 3618.16s]  Time to explore.
[3618.16s -> 3619.55s]  Okay, we're good.
[3623.55s -> 3625.15s]  You climb the spiraling wooden stairs
[3625.15s -> 3626.75s]  picking your way through and over branches.
[3627.55s -> 3629.39s]  Someone has carved something
[3629.39s -> 3631.15s]  into the bark of the tree here.
[3632.40s -> 3632.96s]  What's it say?
[3634.73s -> 3635.23s]  Whoa!
[3637.52s -> 3640.08s]  You regard the carving with some interest.
[3640.88s -> 3643.76s]  It is triangle formed from three stars.
[3643.76s -> 3644.40s]  A spell.
[3645.36s -> 3646.64s]  Using your spell book as a reference,
[3646.64s -> 3648.00s]  you match the stars in the carving
[3648.00s -> 3651.20s]  to those you know until you have the spell memorized.
[3651.20s -> 3653.76s]  This is the SSS spell.
[3653.76s -> 3657.42s]  Though from what you can make out of its alignment,
[3657.42s -> 3659.26s]  it would need a focus to work.
[3659.26s -> 3660.54s]  A ring, most likely.
[3660.54s -> 3663.18s]  With a curious coiled fashion, snake-like.
[3663.74s -> 3666.72s]  The SSS spell has been recorded in your spell book.
[3668.28s -> 3669.08s]  Really?
[3669.08s -> 3677.79s]  Requires a serpent ring.
[3677.79s -> 3681.23s]  The spell enables the caster to force information from serpents.
[3682.11s -> 3684.26s]  Shit.
[3696.59s -> 3697.87s]  Six most useful spell.
[3698.83s -> 3700.65s]  Okay, so I need to get the ring.
[3701.37s -> 3702.01s]  Wherever that is.
[3710.67s -> 3712.03s]  His shrimps is bugs.
[3712.75s -> 3714.43s]  No, it's like a crustacean or some shit.
[3715.48s -> 3717.64s]  You emerge onto a stone walkway
[3717.64s -> 3719.56s]  built in a ring that allows the tree to grow through.
[3720.81s -> 3722.73s]  Resting in its branches is a brass contraption
[3722.73s -> 3724.96s]  much like the ones you've already seen.
[3724.96s -> 3726.72s]  Gears and bearing carefully
[3726.72s -> 3728.48s]  get meshed between the limbs of the tree.
[3729.74s -> 3731.34s]  As leaves gust back and forth,
[3731.34s -> 3734.06s]  something else brass glints from within.
[3734.06s -> 3738.68s]  What is it?
[3738.68s -> 3742.52s]  You reach out to bend in the branch
[3742.52s -> 3744.44s]  from which the gleam is coming.
[3744.44s -> 3747.64s]  It is a ring, slipped over the tip of the branch.
[3747.64s -> 3749.56s]  The wood has grown into the metal somewhat,
[3749.56s -> 3750.92s]  suggesting the ring was placed here
[3750.92s -> 3752.60s]  when the tree was somewhat younger.
[3752.60s -> 3754.28s]  Is it a snake ring?
[3754.92s -> 3759.28s]  You stand on tiptoes to peer at the ring.
[3759.84s -> 3761.04s]  It is some kind of marking,
[3761.04s -> 3762.40s]  but you cannot quite make it out.
[3765.69s -> 3766.19s]  Take it.
[3768.32s -> 3771.20s]  You try to work the ring back up the branch,
[3771.20s -> 3773.04s]  but it is too firmly ingrown.
[3773.04s -> 3774.56s]  You cannot get it to move at all.
[3775.12s -> 3776.58s]  Break the branch.
[3777.22s -> 3780.14s]  The wood is still alive,
[3780.14s -> 3781.82s]  so breaking it is hard work.
[3781.82s -> 3783.02s]  But in the end, the branch gives,
[3783.02s -> 3784.38s]  snapping violently in two.
[3785.02s -> 3786.70s]  The ring pings off the end
[3786.70s -> 3789.18s]  and disappears into the nearby trees.
[3789.18s -> 3789.82s]  Shit.
[3789.82s -> 3791.91s]  Climb down.
[3792.37s -> 3799.81s]  You make your way quickly into the wooden walkway.
[3799.81s -> 3800.69s]  Look for the dropped ring.
[3801.25s -> 3804.16s]  The undergrowth here is quite thick,
[3804.80s -> 3806.78s]  and despite thrashing at the bushes,
[3806.78s -> 3808.30s]  you cannot see any hint of the ring
[3808.30s -> 3809.26s]  that fell from the tower.
[3809.98s -> 3811.18s]  It may not even have fallen
[3811.18s -> 3812.94s]  this close to the tower's base.
[3812.94s -> 3816.29s]  So it's most likely at the bottom of the pool by now.
[3818.24s -> 3818.88s]  No, it's not.
[3819.44s -> 3821.38s]  I'll use magic.
[3828.05s -> 3828.93s]  See the future.
[3830.45s -> 3831.41s]  I didn't know where the-
[3831.41s -> 3834.21s]  I didn't know what fucking bet to put
[3834.21s -> 3835.17s]  on what football team.
[3836.05s -> 3836.37s]  All right.
[3836.37s -> 3837.33s]  See the future?
[3840.96s -> 3841.36s]  I still-
[3841.36s -> 3843.20s]  I do have a crystal orb.
[3848.11s -> 3848.83s]  Xanis hover.
[3849.63s -> 3851.14s]  I could probably float.
[3851.62s -> 3852.80s]  Force field.
[3854.32s -> 3859.06s]  I guess I can only do force-
[3859.06s -> 3866.27s]  I can only-
[3866.99s -> 3867.87s]  I can see the future.
[3868.75s -> 3869.31s]  Let's go for it.
[3871.18s -> 3872.91s]  I'm gonna see the future.
[3873.55s -> 3874.75s]  You settle into a sitting position
[3874.75s -> 3879.58s]  by the roots of a tree
[3879.58s -> 3881.10s]  and take out the orb of crystal.
[3881.82s -> 3882.94s]  You weave the starlight
[3882.94s -> 3884.22s]  into your design around you
[3884.22s -> 3885.02s]  and suddenly you find yourself
[3885.02s -> 3886.06s]  somewhere quite new.
[3886.62s -> 3889.28s]  The world seems to disappear,
[3889.92s -> 3890.96s]  replaced by a vision,
[3891.28s -> 3893.68s]  a ring of tall, shadowy stones,
[3894.24s -> 3895.28s]  and a desolate waste.
[3896.00s -> 3898.13s]  You stand at the edge of the world
[3898.45s -> 3899.17s]  at their center,
[3899.73s -> 3900.53s]  holding above your head
[3900.53s -> 3902.29s]  a long yellow feather
[3902.29s -> 3904.29s]  taken from some colossal bird.
[3905.09s -> 3906.69s]  You are casting a spell
[3906.69s -> 3908.53s]  of curious power.
[3908.53s -> 3913.26s]  See what happens.
[3913.26s -> 3917.30s]  The spell begins to take hold
[3917.30s -> 3918.66s]  and the feather erupts into flame
[3919.30s -> 3921.38s]  as though you held a fiery sword.
[3921.38s -> 3923.74s]  The fire reaches down your arm
[3923.74s -> 3924.86s]  and into your bones
[3924.86s -> 3925.74s]  and you feel yourself
[3925.74s -> 3927.82s]  swelling with great strength.
[3927.82s -> 3929.20s]  The vision fades.
[3930.51s -> 3931.39s]  Darkness closes in
[3931.39s -> 3932.35s]  and you are exhausted.
[3932.91s -> 3933.47s]  You need to rest,
[3933.47s -> 3934.35s]  especially after going all day
[3934.35s -> 3934.91s]  without eating.
[3936.82s -> 3937.06s]  Shit.
[3939.79s -> 3939.95s]  Shit.
[3951.30s -> 3951.70s]  Damn it.
[3952.26s -> 3954.54s]  Can I not get the ring?
[3955.18s -> 3961.92s]  I need to eat something.
[3961.92s -> 3962.72s]  I don't have any food.
[3970.50s -> 3971.06s]  Rewind?
[3971.54s -> 3977.57s]  How far back do I need to go?
[3978.37s -> 3985.39s]  Okay, look at the brass glint.
[3986.74s -> 3987.46s]  Look at the ring.
[3989.44s -> 3990.08s]  Take the ring.
[3995.01s -> 3995.81s]  Break the branch.
[3996.69s -> 3997.09s]  Leave it?
[4000.35s -> 4000.59s]  Shit.
[4001.15s -> 4008.99s]  Let's activate the shit.
[4008.99s -> 4015.66s]  I think I have to break it.
[4015.66s -> 4017.57s]  Maybe time rewind.
[4017.57s -> 4019.57s]  Time first tree won't be grown.
[4020.45s -> 4023.92s]  Wait, so leave it.
[4023.92s -> 4027.36s]  Oh, you're very smart.
[4029.79s -> 4031.81s]  Leave it there.
[4031.81s -> 4033.41s]  We're going to go back into the past.
[4034.13s -> 4035.09s]  Is that going to work?
[4035.09s -> 4036.61s]  That's actually pretty smart.
[4036.61s -> 4037.65s]  All right, let's just do it.
[4037.65s -> 4038.77s]  Let's activate it.
[4038.77s -> 4042.19s]  Scan the forest.
[4044.72s -> 4045.68s]  Look at the mountains.
[4047.20s -> 4047.92s]  Yeah, okay.
[4047.92s -> 4048.72s]  Activate the beacon.
[4049.28s -> 4051.82s]  Here we go.
[4051.82s -> 4059.15s]  I can aim it.
[4060.99s -> 4065.49s]  I could go right here.
[4065.49s -> 4069.63s]  I wonder if that helps.
[4069.63s -> 4072.54s]  Oh, no, this is going to work
[4072.54s -> 4074.14s]  because I will pull it off.
[4074.78s -> 4076.38s]  We're in the present right now.
[4076.38s -> 4079.02s]  It'll pop off and land over on the ground over there.
[4079.02s -> 4083.17s]  You adjust the contraption's position and focus carefully,
[4083.17s -> 4084.93s]  watching the land shift and change under its light
[4084.93s -> 4085.89s]  as you make your adjustment.
[4086.53s -> 4090.08s]  Finally, satisfied, you set the lantern
[4090.08s -> 4093.01s]  into one of the things and step back.
[4093.97s -> 4099.09s]  Okay, so now I have to...
[4099.97s -> 4101.41s]  Can I pull it off now?
[4102.05s -> 4108.58s]  Do I have to pull it off first?
[4109.22s -> 4113.47s]  I may have done it in the wrong order.
[4119.55s -> 4121.86s]  Pronounce the word.
[4121.86s -> 4122.74s]  Crenelations.
[4124.24s -> 4125.04s]  Crenelations.
[4128.34s -> 4129.54s]  Let's climb down and see.
[4130.18s -> 4133.78s]  Outside the tower.
[4134.34s -> 4137.98s]  Okay, make a move.
[4138.62s -> 4142.32s]  I don't think so.
[4142.32s -> 4143.60s]  I think I have to do it in the other order.
[4143.60s -> 4146.16s]  I think I have to pull it off first and then I go back.
[4146.88s -> 4152.13s]  Shine beam, then do the ring.
[4152.13s -> 4153.92s]  All right, what if I go back up the tower?
[4153.92s -> 4155.36s]  Will it give me the option to do it?
[4155.36s -> 4157.74s]  Okay, climb up.
[4163.49s -> 4165.41s]  Shit, I lost the opportunity to do it.
[4165.41s -> 4167.73s]  Let me see what happens if I pull it off and then do this.
[4167.73s -> 4168.85s]  Yeah, because I want to know
[4168.85s -> 4170.69s]  because I've never gotten this ring before.
[4171.25s -> 4172.53s]  Maybe I did in my other playthrough.
[4172.53s -> 4173.33s]  I don't know.
[4173.33s -> 4181.10s]  Okay, eyes adjust.
[4181.98s -> 4183.14s]  Make a move.
[4185.65s -> 4187.65s]  Very loose with the rewinds this run.
[4188.21s -> 4189.09s]  Yeah, I know.
[4189.09s -> 4191.31s]  Look at the carving.
[4191.31s -> 4194.19s]  Yep, now we know the snake spell.
[4195.58s -> 4196.06s]  Go up.
[4198.29s -> 4200.99s]  Okay, look at the brass glint.
[4202.29s -> 4202.93s]  Take the ring.
[4206.24s -> 4206.96s]  Look at the ring.
[4208.61s -> 4209.41s]  Break the branch.
[4210.05s -> 4215.20s]  All right, branch is broken.
[4215.20s -> 4216.00s]  Activate the beam.
[4217.86s -> 4219.14s]  Adjust the beam.
[4219.14s -> 4220.86s]  Get rid of the water.
[4220.86s -> 4224.62s]  So now the theory is that this will be probably right outside,
[4224.62s -> 4225.58s]  just sitting here.
[4225.58s -> 4227.42s]  Let's take a look.
[4227.42s -> 4231.55s]  Okay, climb down.
[4235.44s -> 4236.16s]  Does that do it?
[4238.62s -> 4239.90s]  Look for the dropped ring.
[4244.85s -> 4245.17s]  Shit!
[4245.81s -> 4251.84s]  It's, yeah, I can't activate it here.
[4252.40s -> 4263.02s]  Let's go see if it's out here.
[4263.66s -> 4271.28s]  All right, cross the pool.
[4273.84s -> 4276.14s]  You splash through the water,
[4276.14s -> 4278.30s]  but after a while it seems to dry up,
[4278.30s -> 4280.27s]  leaving only dry rock.
[4280.27s -> 4283.12s]  You make your way easily to the other side.
[4283.12s -> 4285.82s]  In all directions, the forest has been replaced by marsh.
[4286.38s -> 4287.58s]  Except for here.
[4287.66s -> 4290.90s]  A small, bald plain of rock.
[4290.90s -> 4291.94s]  A little way to the southeast,
[4291.94s -> 4294.58s]  a little, at least a stone tower still rises,
[4294.58s -> 4296.82s]  though it is dwarfed by the violent mountains behind.
[4299.28s -> 4299.60s]  Shit!
[4303.87s -> 4305.39s]  All right, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[4305.39s -> 4306.83s]  Rewind, rewind, Andy, I know.
[4306.83s -> 4308.11s]  I know, I know, I know, I know.
[4308.11s -> 4309.47s]  I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[4312.29s -> 4314.13s]  How do I get this?
[4314.13s -> 4315.17s]  Do I need that item?
[4316.38s -> 4318.22s]  All right, get it in your playthrough.
[4318.22s -> 4318.78s]  I don't need it.
[4325.15s -> 4325.95s]  Beacon first.
[4327.97s -> 4329.17s]  Okay, beacon first.
[4330.21s -> 4332.69s]  Which should be, like, where should I aim it?
[4333.33s -> 4334.21s]  Just to cover the water?
[4334.77s -> 4339.23s]  I think that makes sense.
[4339.23s -> 4353.07s]  Touch the crystal.
[4353.87s -> 4355.79s]  Touching the, so when we touch the crystal,
[4355.79s -> 4358.93s]  we can teleport to another beacon.
[4358.93s -> 4367.90s]  So let's actually, hold on, can I aim?
[4367.90s -> 4369.82s]  No, I don't have any other one unlocked.
[4369.82s -> 4371.84s]  Because sometimes if you have another one,
[4371.84s -> 4374.38s]  you can aim it at the tower.
[4374.38s -> 4375.26s]  Point another beacon at it?
[4375.26s -> 4378.24s]  Yeah, I don't have any.
[4378.24s -> 4380.32s]  I have to, there's probably one here,
[4380.32s -> 4381.68s]  like down here that I can aim up this way.
[4391.23s -> 4396.88s]  Okay, it's all right, it's all right.
[4396.88s -> 4401.18s]  This is not as funny as the Jerma compilations on YouTube.
[4403.86s -> 4409.71s]  I mean, I'm just streaming, man.
[4412.61s -> 4415.33s]  A whole stream can't be a funny moments compilation.
[4415.97s -> 4420.66s]  That compilation is probably like eight minutes.
[4421.22s -> 4423.14s]  I've been live for five hours.
[4423.14s -> 4426.61s]  There's probably like two times during this whole stream
[4426.61s -> 4428.21s]  where one of those clips would come from.
[4436.80s -> 4439.92s]  Maybe one of those happens a stream, maybe.
[4440.48s -> 4442.88s]  Sometimes, I'm not so sure.
[4442.88s -> 4445.87s]  Sometimes I'm not so sure.
[4445.87s -> 4455.62s]  Turn the wacky dial up?
[4455.62s -> 4458.98s]  No, no, we don't turn the wacky dial up during sorcery.
[4458.98s -> 4464.85s]  Well, let's make a funny moment for the clip compilations, right?
[4476.88s -> 4478.24s]  That was actually kind of funny.
[4479.44s -> 4480.32s]  That was kind of funny.
[4483.49s -> 4491.25s]  Okay, I want to fix the bridge
[4491.25s -> 4494.29s]  because I want to go over there.
[4494.29s -> 4497.95s]  I want to go back here and walk across it.
[4497.95s -> 4499.55s]  I need two of these though.
[4499.55s -> 4506.37s]  Can I get the whole thing in one go?
[4506.37s -> 4512.77s]  I don't think so.
[4512.77s -> 4519.34s]  I'll get the first part.
[4519.34s -> 4521.42s]  Now let's teleport here.
[4523.22s -> 4524.42s]  And I'm going to come over this way
[4524.42s -> 4525.78s]  because I want to see there's probably something here.
[4538.82s -> 4540.93s]  Adjust the beam.
[4540.93s -> 4550.51s]  I'm going to aim this one this way.
[4551.15s -> 4559.23s]  All right, so we are here.
[4559.23s -> 4560.83s]  You adjust the beam around its track,
[4560.83s -> 4562.35s]  sweeping the glow across the land,
[4562.35s -> 4564.67s]  tie rope ladder to battle mint.
[4564.67s -> 4565.15s]  What?
[4565.15s -> 4571.57s]  You turn about on the spot, talking in the view.
[4572.83s -> 4574.59s]  Oh, taking in the view in all directions.
[4574.59s -> 4579.25s]  The fissure in the land is now to the south and rushes with water.
[4579.25s -> 4581.17s]  And where the light from the cylinder falls,
[4581.17s -> 4582.85s]  all is bright and green.
[4582.85s -> 4585.25s]  The effect makes your eyes water.
[4585.25s -> 4588.27s]  Should I tie a rope?
[4588.27s -> 4589.63s]  I have a rope?
[4589.63s -> 4598.48s]  Maybe I should just do it.
[4598.48s -> 4600.35s]  Let's try it.
[4601.54s -> 4603.22s]  You fasten the end of the rope ladder
[4603.22s -> 4604.42s]  to the battle mint of the tower
[4604.42s -> 4606.10s]  and then toss the rungs over the side.
[4608.70s -> 4609.34s]  All right, let's go.
[4612.42s -> 4613.06s]  What did that do?
[4617.15s -> 4621.44s]  I don't know.
[4621.44s -> 4623.44s]  The inside of the tower is cavernous and empty,
[4623.44s -> 4624.96s]  but for a stone staircase.
[4624.96s -> 4625.92s]  Why did I do that?
[4625.92s -> 4628.91s]  I want my rope back.
[4628.91s -> 4637.65s]  Yeah, I want my rope back.
[4637.65s -> 4640.34s]  All right, actually tying the people out saying muted.
[4640.34s -> 4642.98s]  That's a joke from like fucking 2016.
[4643.70s -> 4644.50s]  Come on, guys.
[4645.63s -> 4646.91s]  That's not going in the compilation.
[4647.47s -> 4667.26s]  All right, so now I want to go back this way over here
[4667.26s -> 4669.74s]  because I want to see what happens here.
[4669.74s -> 4670.38s]  What happens?
[4670.38s -> 4671.74s]  Can I like jump off maybe?
[4672.30s -> 4673.02s]  I have no idea.
[4673.02s -> 4674.22s]  Let's go find out.
[4674.22s -> 4679.73s]  All right, follow an old road.
[4679.73s -> 4680.53s]  Darkness closes in.
[4680.53s -> 4683.01s]  You need to rest, especially if you're going all the way without eating.
[4683.01s -> 4684.77s]  I just need to go to a town or something.
[4685.41s -> 4688.91s]  This is where I was.
[4688.91s -> 4690.03s]  That's where I started.
[4690.03s -> 4693.58s]  The cold night lingers on.
[4695.54s -> 4696.98s]  All right, here we go.
[4696.98s -> 4700.06s]  The bridge is now here.
[4702.85s -> 4704.77s]  You lost a little gold.
[4704.77s -> 4707.65s]  Met Flanker once more and found one new clue.
[4707.65s -> 4713.94s]  You ever played 80 Days?
[4713.94s -> 4715.62s]  Same people who made Sorcery.
[4715.62s -> 4716.50s]  I have, actually.
[4716.50s -> 4717.14s]  Long time ago.
[4717.86s -> 4718.74s]  That one's really good, too.
[4719.54s -> 4722.34s]  I like Sorcery more because I feel like it's a little more involved.
[4723.79s -> 4725.31s]  But 80 Days is very good, too.
[4726.88s -> 4727.95s]  Okay.
[4727.95s -> 4730.75s]  You return up the winding path to the top of the mountain.
[4730.75s -> 4733.47s]  In the distance, the sun breaks over the horizon.
[4733.47s -> 4735.79s]  You've been awake all night and are weaker for it.
[4735.79s -> 4738.14s]  At the peak of the mountain is a sudden plateau
[4738.14s -> 4740.70s]  looking down across a fetid swampy valley to the east.
[4741.18s -> 4743.26s]  But you may not need to tramp through them
[4743.26s -> 4746.94s]  as a magnificent stone bridge spans outwards from its peak.
[4746.94s -> 4749.73s]  Watch for a second.
[4749.73s -> 4754.30s]  Altered by some sixth sense, you hesitate behind a rocky outcrop.
[4754.30s -> 4758.14s]  Just a figure shambles, just a figure shambles into view,
[4758.14s -> 4760.70s]  emerging from a small hut beside the bridge.
[4763.25s -> 4764.61s]  It's me, the Annalander.
[4765.55s -> 4766.27s]  Look at the figure.
[4768.54s -> 4770.70s]  You stare at the hunched figure.
[4770.70s -> 4774.22s]  He is aged, leaning heavily on a wizened stick
[4774.22s -> 4778.46s]  with one eye much larger than the other and a hunch on his back.
[4778.46s -> 4783.78s]  The figure shambles onto the first stone of the bridge.
[4784.50s -> 4790.91s]  Sighing at the effort, wait for him to cross.
[4791.47s -> 4794.13s]  I think I want to announce myself.
[4794.13s -> 4805.39s]  You get to your feet.
[4805.39s -> 4807.55s]  Oh there, greetings!
[4807.55s -> 4810.46s]  The figure turns to you, leaning heavily on its stick.
[4812.03s -> 4814.51s]  An ugly sword, what brings you here?
[4815.07s -> 4822.42s]  If the Vancas bridge you wish to cross, prepared be for dismay and fear.
[4822.42s -> 4824.61s]  You are Vancas.
[4824.61s -> 4825.97s]  You're Vancas.
[4825.97s -> 4828.59s]  Vancas is my name, it's true.
[4829.15s -> 4831.71s]  I give you that, what good it do.
[4831.71s -> 4836.26s]  What lies in the valley below?
[4837.58s -> 4839.34s]  Martian murder, tower death.
[4839.90s -> 4843.15s]  Above it all, a drop to catch the breath.
[4846.83s -> 4850.62s]  The bridgekeeper pauses to scratch his swollen right eye.
[4850.62s -> 4853.97s]  Approach the bridge.
[4853.97s -> 4856.58s]  You approach the bridge.
[4856.58s -> 4859.78s]  This is my bridge, it spans a rift.
[4860.34s -> 4862.74s]  To pass you must provide a gift.
[4863.44s -> 4867.20s]  The sudden image of the orb of crystal pops into your head.
[4867.20s -> 4873.58s]  You want my orb of crystal?
[4873.58s -> 4878.62s]  We can do better than that.
[4879.50s -> 4881.10s]  Your price is too much, rogue.
[4882.22s -> 4884.77s]  Vancas shakes his head without interest.
[4884.77s -> 4888.14s]  Then the hunchback looks up sharply.
[4888.14s -> 4892.00s]  Unless a simpler price you'd gladly pay.
[4892.00s -> 4896.86s]  An arm, a leg, finger, prey?
[4896.86s -> 4901.71s]  Take my leg, take a finger.
[4902.51s -> 4903.01s]  No.
[4907.33s -> 4907.97s]  No.
[4907.97s -> 4911.39s]  You shake your head, Vancas shrugs.
[4911.39s -> 4912.78s]  Just as you please.
[4913.60s -> 4916.16s]  Patience is some men's disease.
[4916.16s -> 4919.57s]  With a thought he gently reminds you of the original price.
[4920.13s -> 4921.01s]  The orb.
[4921.01s -> 4932.11s]  Walk away.
[4932.11s -> 4933.79s]  Your heart, you find, is pounding.
[4933.79s -> 4935.55s]  You turn and leave to the mountaintop.
[4940.46s -> 4941.02s]  God damn it.
[4955.12s -> 4965.07s]  Wait, what?
[4965.07s -> 4965.63s]  Okay, we're good.
[4968.51s -> 4972.85s]  Rewind Ronald?
[4975.01s -> 4976.69s]  Yeah, but I know.
[4976.69s -> 4978.13s]  We don't have any rules today.
[4978.13s -> 4984.70s]  I, look, there cannot be rewind rules.
[4985.09s -> 4986.99s]  When it's the first time I've played.
[4986.99s -> 4988.67s]  In the middle of an episode.
[4988.67s -> 4990.53s]  A year later.
[4990.53s -> 4992.51s]  We'll do that next time.
[4992.51s -> 4993.47s]  Okay, announce myself.
[4996.27s -> 4997.71s]  You are Vancas.
[4997.71s -> 4999.15s]  It's me, okay.
[4999.15s -> 5001.34s]  What lies in the valley below?
[5001.34s -> 5002.62s]  Martian mud.
[5002.62s -> 5003.42s]  Approach the bridge.
[5006.03s -> 5006.59s]  Cast a spell.
[5012.11s -> 5016.06s]  Okay, I could zap.
[5016.06s -> 5017.82s]  I could literally just fucking zap.
[5017.82s -> 5018.38s]  I could zap.
[5021.10s -> 5022.70s]  That's the meme one.
[5022.70s -> 5023.90s]  Pop is throw a grenade.
[5024.46s -> 5025.34s]  I don't have a pebble.
[5032.50s -> 5033.86s]  This is magic protection.
[5039.78s -> 5041.54s]  Dim is cause stupidity.
[5043.10s -> 5043.74s]  Let's try it.
[5047.14s -> 5049.62s]  You weave the starlight into your design around you.
[5049.62s -> 5051.38s]  But Vancas raises one arm.
[5051.38s -> 5054.50s]  On which is a huge bone bracelet.
[5054.50s -> 5056.08s]  He utters something under his breath.
[5056.08s -> 5059.79s]  And a moment later, your spell has evaporated.
[5059.79s -> 5062.91s]  Curses like chickens will round your head be flocked.
[5062.91s -> 5066.42s]  Lest you learn that every spell you cast is by another.
[5066.98s -> 5067.78s]  Blocked.
[5067.78s -> 5070.59s]  You recognize the spell he cast.
[5070.59s -> 5075.22s]  So then the spell of stupidity is negated by that of illusion.
[5075.30s -> 5076.74s]  You've learned a new counter spell.
[5078.80s -> 5089.84s]  Okay, well, I think I'm gonna give him a finger.
[5089.84s -> 5091.46s]  Should I give him a leg?
[5092.64s -> 5092.96s]  Zap?
[5094.24s -> 5094.56s]  Fine.
[5098.29s -> 5099.86s]  See what happens.
[5103.68s -> 5103.92s]  Zap.
[5104.64s -> 5111.28s]  Gathering a bolt of lightning in your palm.
[5111.28s -> 5114.32s]  But Vancas pulls out some kind of jeweled medallion in return.
[5114.32s -> 5116.32s]  And begins to hover up into the air.
[5116.32s -> 5118.24s]  A moment later, he is on the ground.
[5118.24s -> 5119.68s]  And the lightning in your palm is gone.
[5121.34s -> 5122.70s]  If you will not learn the rule,
[5122.70s -> 5125.50s]  you must expect to be taken for a cretin.
[5125.50s -> 5127.17s]  This spell is familiar to you.
[5127.17s -> 5130.93s]  It seems the magic of lightning counters the pattern of levitation.
[5130.93s -> 5138.46s]  He wants the orb.
[5139.36s -> 5140.80s]  I could give him a finger.
[5140.80s -> 5142.24s]  I would rather lose a finger.
[5144.53s -> 5145.17s]  Take a finger.
[5145.81s -> 5148.94s]  A finger, you reply boldly.
[5148.94s -> 5151.02s]  Very good, the price is made.
[5151.02s -> 5153.26s]  The littlest one now conveyed.
[5154.06s -> 5155.90s]  And he does not seem to do anything.
[5155.90s -> 5158.62s]  But the little finger on your sword hand bends backwards
[5158.62s -> 5160.38s]  until it snaps with a click.
[5160.38s -> 5162.46s]  And then detaches, falling to the dirt.
[5162.46s -> 5163.90s]  You howl in pain.
[5163.90s -> 5165.79s]  And that is that.
[5165.79s -> 5169.15s]  With a last clear nod, the hunchback steps from the bridge
[5169.15s -> 5170.51s]  and back into his hut.
[5170.51s -> 5172.35s]  Leaving the way clear for you to pass.
[5172.35s -> 5178.34s]  Okay.
[5178.72s -> 5186.48s]  You step onto the bridge, the air moves a little.
[5187.04s -> 5188.40s]  Still icy, but fresh.
[5188.96s -> 5191.60s]  The flagstones laid along the bridge top
[5191.60s -> 5195.01s]  form the straightest, smoothest road you've ever seen.
[5195.01s -> 5198.77s]  Finer even than the King's Road of Analand.
[5198.77s -> 5200.34s]  Look down.
[5200.34s -> 5202.26s]  You cast a look over the side of the walkway
[5202.26s -> 5204.42s]  and your head immediately begins to swim.
[5204.42s -> 5207.95s]  The drop is immense, the ground lost far below and missed.
[5207.95s -> 5209.71s]  How was this bridge built?
[5209.71s -> 5210.99s]  How could it ever be repaired?
[5213.68s -> 5214.18s]  Shit.
[5219.55s -> 5220.05s]  Oh.
[5220.59s -> 5224.32s]  The rising winds pull at your hair and cloak.
[5224.32s -> 5225.84s]  You reach the middle of the bridge
[5225.84s -> 5227.60s]  and the stones begin to shimmer and ripple.
[5228.24s -> 5230.96s]  The smooth white flagstones become cracked and old.
[5231.76s -> 5233.20s]  Palked with holes and puddles.
[5233.84s -> 5235.84s]  Some of which have burrowed right through the path.
[5236.56s -> 5238.88s]  The grand pillars left and right are now broken.
[5238.88s -> 5240.24s]  And up ahead you see something worse.
[5240.88s -> 5241.38s]  A gap.
[5246.29s -> 5246.93s]  The edge.
[5252.85s -> 5255.41s]  You pick your way to the broken edge through the thin clouds.
[5255.41s -> 5258.05s]  You can make out the canopy of a forest far below.
[5260.11s -> 5260.75s]  Ooh!
[5260.75s -> 5264.96s]  I can use the ladder here.
[5264.96s -> 5265.46s]  Look down.
[5266.00s -> 5267.92s]  You look over the edge but there's nothing to be seen.
[5267.92s -> 5269.68s]  Merely fallen rocks and empty air.
[5270.40s -> 5275.22s]  I don't want to lose a gold piece for no reason.
[5275.78s -> 5280.32s]  I'm going to use the...
[5280.88s -> 5282.24s]  Because this would be a good way to get back up.
[5283.90s -> 5285.90s]  You consider using the rope ladder to clamber down
[5285.90s -> 5287.58s]  but the drop is far too far.
[5287.58s -> 5288.08s]  Oh.
[5288.70s -> 5289.20s]  Uh.
[5291.73s -> 5294.38s]  Toss a gold piece over the edge.
[5295.02s -> 5297.42s]  It turns and turns in the air and eventually disappears.
[5297.50s -> 5298.78s]  The drop is dizzying.
[5298.78s -> 5300.46s]  Well I just wasted a fucking gold piece.
[5305.12s -> 5305.62s]  Damn it!
[5307.68s -> 5308.88s]  Well I can't rewind for that.
[5309.52s -> 5311.65s]  What about over here?
[5317.22s -> 5318.74s]  Oh this is so I can...
[5318.74s -> 5319.24s]  Okay.
[5321.71s -> 5324.51s]  This is I can climb down here again.
[5325.07s -> 5328.05s]  I need the bridge to be complete.
[5328.05s -> 5340.74s]  Alright I'm going to teleport back over here.
[5340.74s -> 5341.94s]  You lost a finger for this.
[5343.34s -> 5344.46s]  Yeah well when I come back...
[5344.46s -> 5347.10s]  When I can do this again I won't have to pay two fingers.
[5347.90s -> 5351.33s]  Feeling like Herm.
[5351.33s -> 5352.85s]  God of cloud cover.
[5352.85s -> 5355.46s]  Who walks the heavens as the day rolls by.
[5355.46s -> 5358.34s]  It's a great pity whoever built this did not think to build a bridge
[5358.34s -> 5359.94s]  all the way across Lake Iklala.
[5362.72s -> 5364.48s]  Alright I'm just going to get back here and we'll teleport.
[5365.04s -> 5366.88s]  Back to here.
[5367.92s -> 5368.40s]  And then...
[5369.04s -> 5370.00s]  I want to go down here.
[5370.56s -> 5372.32s]  There's a town here.
[5373.36s -> 5374.80s]  I need to buy food and stuff.
[5374.80s -> 5375.20s]  Yeah.
[5375.20s -> 5376.00s]  I'm going to...
[5376.00s -> 5377.12s]  Let's go this way.
[5377.12s -> 5382.98s]  Okay.
[5383.76s -> 5384.48s]  Look in the hut.
[5385.12s -> 5388.80s]  Overcome by curiosity you approach the hut.
[5388.80s -> 5391.52s]  It takes two circles to find there is no apparent door at all.
[5393.71s -> 5394.83s]  Call out for vankas.
[5395.63s -> 5397.47s]  You call out for vankas but there is no reply
[5397.47s -> 5401.68s]  and your voice is carried away by the endless wind.
[5401.68s -> 5402.40s]  Knock on the hut.
[5403.46s -> 5406.18s]  You tap once then quickly stop.
[5406.18s -> 5408.82s]  As you feel your skin sticking to the hut walls.
[5409.54s -> 5413.15s]  There are now grazed patches on your knuckles.
[5413.15s -> 5418.59s]  Looking more closely you see the hut itself seems to not be not canvas
[5418.59s -> 5420.35s]  but a thick layer of skin.
[5420.35s -> 5425.55s]  Okay.
[5425.55s -> 5427.82s]  That's a little gross.
[5428.54s -> 5431.55s]  Head back into the forest of Snato.
[5437.92s -> 5440.32s]  I could also go here.
[5440.32s -> 5441.60s]  No, we did a lot of this already.
[5442.24s -> 5446.05s]  Some of this up here was not explored but we can come back.
[5449.66s -> 5451.66s]  Play this with your family, Jerma said earlier.
[5452.22s -> 5456.75s]  You climb down the mountain and join the old road.
[5457.39s -> 5460.35s]  Clouds rumble as they roll across the inky sky.
[5460.35s -> 5461.87s]  It will be night soon.
[5461.87s -> 5464.99s]  Suddenly the ground beneath you rumbles and begins to slide into itself.
[5464.99s -> 5466.35s]  There's no time for a spell.
[5466.35s -> 5468.59s]  Your arms are wide trying to maintain your balance.
[5469.23s -> 5469.73s]  Jump.
[5470.13s -> 5475.65s]  You try to jump clear but gain no decent purchase on the shifting sand.
[5475.65s -> 5478.85s]  Meanwhile the ground is moving away faster and faster from under your feet.
[5478.85s -> 5482.13s]  You fall backwards spreading out your legs to reduce your pressure on the sand.
[5482.13s -> 5485.89s]  Then you scramble back as fast as possible trying to escape the growing pit.
[5485.89s -> 5487.84s]  God damn it.
[5492.04s -> 5498.00s]  So I'm gonna giant.
[5498.64s -> 5499.60s]  Giant could probably carry me.
[5502.92s -> 5503.88s]  Zip.
[5503.88s -> 5505.32s]  I don't have the ring to teleport.
[5507.54s -> 5508.42s]  I could float.
[5509.14s -> 5511.19s]  Float in air.
[5516.18s -> 5517.54s]  Wall is making invisible wall.
[5518.50s -> 5519.86s]  Or walk is make a shield.
[5520.90s -> 5527.88s]  I'm gonna say we get the giant.
[5528.52s -> 5538.45s]  Float is probably the simplest one.
[5538.45s -> 5540.29s]  I want to save the giant's teeth.
[5540.29s -> 5541.33s]  Let's float.
[5541.33s -> 5545.03s]  There's no time to waste.
[5545.03s -> 5548.79s]  You cast the spell lightening your body weight to a mere fraction of normal.
[5548.79s -> 5552.95s]  Should you fall you'll be safe but the spell won't last long.
[5552.95s -> 5557.83s]  But though you are now floating above the ground the ground is still moving downwards
[5557.83s -> 5559.03s]  and so are you.
[5559.59s -> 5564.20s]  As the ground slips further away forming a pit in the ground you slide helplessly
[5564.20s -> 5566.44s]  in to where something is waiting.
[5566.44s -> 5571.73s]  So I just slowly fell very very comfortably.
[5588.44s -> 5589.08s]  Let's get a giant.
[5589.64s -> 5596.72s]  Consulting the stars you bind the magic throwing a giant's tooth into the pit before you.
[5597.36s -> 5599.52s]  For a moment there's a strong colon of smoke
[5600.08s -> 5603.84s]  and a moment later a giant is floundering in the quicksand in front of you.
[5605.78s -> 5606.82s]  Climb onto the giant.
[5607.46s -> 5612.08s]  You scramble up onto the giant's shoulders and then onto its head
[5612.08s -> 5614.00s]  until you are clear of the quicksand below.
[5615.01s -> 5618.85s]  Whatever is underneath is clearly finding the giant difficult to swallow
[5618.85s -> 5624.88s]  because the land slip slows in speed.
[5624.88s -> 5625.44s]  Jump clear.
[5626.24s -> 5627.92s]  You jump clear of the land slip.
[5630.53s -> 5630.85s]  Watch.
[5633.27s -> 5636.79s]  At a safe distance you watch as the sand trap continues to swirl.
[5636.79s -> 5639.99s]  A moment later a creature has erupted from the surface.
[5639.99s -> 5641.91s]  It is a badu beetle.
[5641.91s -> 5654.77s]  Where's the giant?
[5661.11s -> 5662.95s]  Cause lively dancing.
[5662.95s -> 5664.07s]  I don't need to see any others.
[5667.46s -> 5669.30s]  You pull out your pipe and begin to play.
[5670.02s -> 5672.66s]  The beetle freezes at its advance from the pit
[5672.66s -> 5677.86s]  then rears up onto its back legs and begins to wave its front legs in the air
[5678.42s -> 5680.82s]  in a rhythmic cycling motion.
[5680.82s -> 5684.77s]  The sand underneath the beetle begins to slide back down into the pit.
[5684.77s -> 5688.00s]  Play slower?
[5688.00s -> 5689.09s]  I wonder.
[5689.09s -> 5690.37s]  I'm gonna play slower.
[5690.37s -> 5694.92s]  You begin to play more slowly and the badu beetle responds.
[5694.92s -> 5698.76s]  The speed of its flailing becomes a stately crawl.
[5698.76s -> 5703.72s]  As its legs slow down it can no longer hold itself up in the sand pit
[5703.72s -> 5707.54s]  and it begins to slide quietly out of sight.
[5707.54s -> 5708.74s]  Time to move on.
[5708.74s -> 5711.73s]  Well that was dangerous.
[5712.29s -> 5713.62s]  Okay.
[5714.42s -> 5721.43s]  Yeah we kind of sacrificed the giant to the quicksand.
[5721.43s -> 5722.39s]  That was kind of terrible.
[5727.89s -> 5728.37s]  All right.
[5728.37s -> 5730.23s]  Back up.
[5730.23s -> 5731.60s]  I'm gonna teleport.
[5732.90s -> 5736.18s]  I will probably move this to somewhere better as well.
[5736.82s -> 5741.12s]  This is actually a good place to sleep.
[5741.12s -> 5749.09s]  You settle down expecting a peaceful night.
[5749.09s -> 5752.37s]  You've eaten nothing today but there is nothing you can do to abate your hunger.
[5752.37s -> 5754.29s]  I have raw meat but I can't cook it.
[5754.29s -> 5757.00s]  Let's go to bed.
[5757.00s -> 5758.84s]  You lie back and try to forget your troubles.
[5758.84s -> 5762.92s]  You feel untouched by danger here and your slumber is unbroken by dreams.
[5766.69s -> 5768.69s]  You lost significant stamina.
[5768.69s -> 5769.89s]  Lost a bit of gold.
[5769.89s -> 5773.01s]  Walked on the ancient backlands bridge and found no new clues.
[5784.77s -> 5786.05s]  Adjust the beam to be...
[5790.40s -> 5794.08s]  Do I want to change it from the forest of snata to whatever it would be?
[5794.08s -> 5795.62s]  I'll leave it as it is.
[5795.62s -> 5797.72s]  Did I do that?
[5800.37s -> 5807.52s]  Have I done this town over here?
[5807.52s -> 5809.14s]  I don't think so.
[5809.14s -> 5810.02s]  Didn't remember.
[5810.02s -> 5814.40s]  Let's go check it out.
[5814.40s -> 5822.10s]  I don't remember going up that high.
[5822.66s -> 5827.97s]  I feel like there's just so many possibilities to go from this section.
[5827.97s -> 5828.77s]  Where do you even begin?
[5829.49s -> 5831.75s]  That's some of the most fun of this game.
[5832.31s -> 5835.08s]  Okay.
[5835.08s -> 5836.60s]  Rest here for a few hours to regain...
[5836.60s -> 5841.75s]  Yeah, let me actually do that.
[5841.75s -> 5842.47s]  Okay, yeah.
[5842.47s -> 5844.26s]  I got some stamina back, I'm all right.
[5845.83s -> 5846.79s]  Let's go up here.
[5847.35s -> 5849.57s]  It's a little hut here.
[5849.57s -> 5850.61s]  I think I've been to the hut.
[5851.25s -> 5857.94s]  It's also easier to be fair if you haven't taken a 297 day break.
[5860.92s -> 5861.96s]  That's true.
[5861.96s -> 5869.80s]  Now let's set up to that town.
[5869.80s -> 5873.67s]  Okay.
[5875.43s -> 5875.83s]  All right.
[5877.91s -> 5878.47s]  No, I don't think...
[5878.47s -> 5879.35s]  I have not been up here.
[5879.99s -> 5887.73s]  You pick your way carefully over the rocks to the edge of a road.
[5887.73s -> 5889.89s]  The wind picks up as the evening draws on.
[5889.89s -> 5891.17s]  Soon it will be dark.
[5891.17s -> 5894.31s]  Towards the village.
[5894.31s -> 5904.63s]  The path winds up through low foothills towards an open area in the mountains.
[5904.63s -> 5907.51s]  As you approach the foothills, you see a wooden palisade.
[5908.15s -> 5911.62s]  Spiked trunks planted to form a fence with a single gate.
[5911.62s -> 5916.12s]  From beyond comes the sound of chatting and banter and dogs.
[5916.12s -> 5919.44s]  This must be the village the shepherd boy mentioned.
[5919.44s -> 5925.97s]  Remember that 300 days ago?
[5925.97s -> 5931.25s]  The shepherd boy told us about this town up here, right?
[5931.25s -> 5933.35s]  It was only a few weeks ago.
[5933.35s -> 5937.57s]  It seems to be a bustling, busy place.
[5937.57s -> 5941.57s]  Presumably this village owns the fields and farmland through which you have been walking.
[5941.57s -> 5944.20s]  You could go in or skirt around it.
[5944.20s -> 5947.56s]  We're going in.
[5947.56s -> 5952.00s]  You pause on the other side of the gate.
[5952.00s -> 5956.32s]  One hand on your sword hilt should anyone be foolish enough to spring a trap.
[5956.32s -> 5957.73s]  But nothing un...
[5958.45s -> 5959.65s]  Nothing weird happens.
[5959.65s -> 5961.57s]  Nothing untoward happens.
[5961.57s -> 5966.40s]  The village is a small collection of wooden huts built into a basin
[5966.40s -> 5968.48s]  within the mountains at its back.
[5968.48s -> 5972.05s]  In the center is a fire pit surrounded by tables and benches.
[5972.05s -> 5982.85s]  Several groups are sitting and eating.
[5982.85s -> 5985.33s]  Pleasant smells drift over from the kitchen hut.
[5985.33s -> 5987.57s]  The sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky.
[5987.57s -> 5990.68s]  Oh boy.
[5990.68s -> 5991.78s]  All right.
[5991.78s -> 5997.11s]  The fire, the kitchens, wait for nightfall.
[5997.11s -> 6002.05s]  I'm gonna go to the kitchens because I need food.
[6002.05s -> 6004.96s]  Bad.
[6004.96s -> 6007.28s]  In one corner of the village is a cook's hut.
[6007.28s -> 6009.68s]  Inside a lady is stirring a deep cauldron.
[6009.68s -> 6012.39s]  She looks up and nods to you through the doorway.
[6012.39s -> 6014.79s]  Clouds begin to tumble across the dimming sky.
[6014.79s -> 6016.29s]  It will be dark soon.
[6016.29s -> 6018.95s]  Go inside.
[6018.95s -> 6021.62s]  You step inside.
[6021.62s -> 6022.26s]  Greet the cook.
[6022.26s -> 6023.06s]  Look into the cauldron.
[6023.06s -> 6025.12s]  Let's greet the cook.
[6025.12s -> 6027.67s]  Greetings, you declare.
[6027.67s -> 6029.40s]  You're welcome.
[6029.40s -> 6030.92s]  If there's something you want.
[6030.92s -> 6033.48s]  If you don't want anything, there's the door.
[6033.48s -> 6038.13s]  The chef goes over to a shelf to collect some herbs from a jar.
[6038.13s -> 6040.40s]  Look into the cauldron.
[6040.40s -> 6041.44s]  You look into the cauldron.
[6041.44s -> 6043.17s]  The cook is stirring.
[6043.17s -> 6044.76s]  Meat broth.
[6044.76s -> 6051.19s]  But if it looks like there isn't any meat, it's because it's snotty cat.
[6051.19s -> 6055.43s]  And they are invisible.
[6055.43s -> 6057.27s]  When they have their eyes closed, that's right.
[6058.04s -> 6064.10s]  And since some close their eyes, when they die, you can end up with invisible meat.
[6064.10s -> 6067.38s]  Everyone says it tastes nicer than the invisible kind.
[6068.37s -> 6069.96s]  I'm not so sure.
[6069.96s -> 6071.80s]  It's certainly harder to cook right.
[6071.80s -> 6076.21s]  The lady pours a little oil into the soup from a flask above the cauldron.
[6076.21s -> 6079.20s]  Ask about the village.
[6080.40s -> 6081.60s]  What caul?
[6081.60s -> 6083.04s]  What caul you?
[6083.04s -> 6084.88s]  What can you tell me of this village, you ask?
[6086.85s -> 6092.08s]  This is Kariyama, the main village in the fields of Ishtara.
[6092.08s -> 6094.72s]  Where are you from if you don't know that already?
[6096.72s -> 6098.24s]  I am stupid.
[6098.24s -> 6100.48s]  You tell her, lying unskillfully.
[6100.48s -> 6104.05s]  The chef raises an eyebrow but does not reply.
[6104.05s -> 6107.83s]  A thin smell of smoke wafts into the tent.
[6107.83s -> 6109.35s]  Oh, by thruff.
[6109.35s -> 6112.23s]  The cook curses and disappears through a flap at the back.
[6112.23s -> 6114.44s]  For a moment, you are alone.
[6114.44s -> 6119.35s]  I mean, I'm taking a fucking free bowl of soup.
[6119.35s -> 6122.60s]  While she is gone, you fill a bowl with soup and begin to eat.
[6122.60s -> 6125.49s]  But it's too hot to finish all of it before she returns.
[6129.40s -> 6129.96s]  Pour it back in.
[6131.64s -> 6133.80s]  Uh, eat it.
[6133.80s -> 6134.84s]  You keep eating.
[6134.84s -> 6137.00s]  She stares at you with surprise.
[6137.00s -> 6140.02s]  You did not pay for that, she remarks.
[6144.82s -> 6145.46s]  Say nothing?
[6146.18s -> 6153.17s]  No, I have, I gotta pay for it.
[6153.17s -> 6156.79s]  Here, throw her four gold pieces.
[6156.79s -> 6159.43s]  You throw down four gold pieces.
[6159.43s -> 6163.68s]  She takes them but looks clearly quite unhappy.
[6163.68s -> 6165.28s]  There is nothing more of interest here.
[6165.28s -> 6168.10s]  You nod to the chef, then turn and leave the hut.
[6168.10s -> 6170.29s]  The sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky.
[6170.29s -> 6172.16s]  It'll be dark.
[6172.16s -> 6172.96s]  All right, well, whatever.
[6172.96s -> 6176.18s]  I bought the food.
[6176.18s -> 6178.76s]  I'm fine.
[6178.76s -> 6185.28s]  Go to the fire.
[6185.28s -> 6187.44s]  The fire pit is in the center of the village.
[6187.44s -> 6189.12s]  You walk past low huts.
[6189.12s -> 6192.07s]  A few figures glance at you, but they show a little interest.
[6192.07s -> 6197.00s]  The fire is kept low and smoldering, ready to be reignited in the evening.
[6197.00s -> 6202.45s]  A few people surround it, watching and talking.
[6202.45s -> 6204.92s]  Look, cook my raw food.
[6204.92s -> 6209.32s]  You unwrap the portions of raw meat and fish you have been carrying and roast them in the fire.
[6209.32s -> 6211.56s]  Save it.
[6211.56s -> 6213.92s]  You save your provisions they should keep well.
[6213.92s -> 6217.36s]  Someone passes around a charred joint of meat, offering you a bite.
[6220.16s -> 6224.34s]  That's really good, actually.
[6225.46s -> 6227.36s]  I might just pass it on.
[6227.36s -> 6230.52s]  Because, is that...
[6230.52s -> 6234.84s]  Would they see that as, wow, that's really nice of you because food is kind of scarce?
[6234.84s -> 6238.28s]  Or, why did you refuse food, you piece of shit?
[6238.28s -> 6239.64s]  I'm going to eat it.
[6239.64s -> 6241.01s]  You take a bite.
[6241.01s -> 6244.93s]  The meat is black and sooty, but rich with flavors and spices.
[6246.96s -> 6247.76s]  Eat the rest.
[6249.27s -> 6250.23s]  I'm going to pass it.
[6250.23s -> 6255.25s]  Having taken your share, you pass the joint onto the next person.
[6255.25s -> 6259.65s]  See what you did there, Steve Jackson.
[6259.65s -> 6264.18s]  Um, let's introduce myself.
[6264.18s -> 6266.52s]  Greetings, you declare to the people nearby.
[6266.52s -> 6269.96s]  They look up at you with some curiosity.
[6269.96s -> 6272.20s]  What is this place?
[6272.20s -> 6273.64s]  The lounging woman answers.
[6273.64s -> 6278.53s]  This is Karima, the central village of all of Ishtara.
[6278.53s -> 6282.12s]  Then they seem to lose interest in you, and return to staring at the fire and talking to
[6282.12s -> 6283.56s]  each other in low voices.
[6283.56s -> 6286.85s]  Throw a stick on the fire.
[6286.85s -> 6291.97s]  I don't want to fuck with the fire, because this is their domain here.
[6291.97s -> 6295.25s]  In the base of the smoldering fire pit are a few pebbles and some sand.
[6298.15s -> 6299.43s]  Hold on a second here.
[6299.43s -> 6305.67s]  Pebbles are for grenades.
[6306.23s -> 6308.68s]  What is sand for?
[6308.68s -> 6318.12s]  Yeah, see, pebbles for pop.
[6318.92s -> 6319.91s]  What, sand?
[6323.00s -> 6329.60s]  Ah, I feel like both of these can be pretty effective.
[6334.56s -> 6336.16s]  But I think I'm taking the pebbles.
[6336.88s -> 6338.24s]  Take a pebble.
[6338.24s -> 6340.18s]  You move to reach into the pit and then pause.
[6340.18s -> 6342.26s]  There's still plenty of heat coming from the fire.
[6342.82s -> 6345.68s]  Take another one.
[6345.68s -> 6349.41s]  You reach in and close your fist around a pebble, but it is burning hot.
[6349.81s -> 6353.01s]  You snatch your hand back, a heavy red burn on your palm.
[6353.01s -> 6357.73s]  It's not only painful, but since this is your sword arm, it will lower your ability to fight.
[6357.73s -> 6358.69s]  And I don't have a finger.
[6360.07s -> 6360.95s]  Ranger!
[6360.95s -> 6362.24s]  One of the villagers declares.
[6363.11s -> 6364.31s]  We were having a discussion.
[6364.87s -> 6368.79s]  Who would be most likely to best the other in a fight?
[6368.79s -> 6370.79s]  A goblin or a wolf?
[6370.79s -> 6374.42s]  I have seen such a fight.
[6375.49s -> 6376.21s]  Surely the wolf.
[6376.77s -> 6381.00s]  The goblin.
[6381.00s -> 6383.27s]  Um, it's probably the wolf.
[6384.64s -> 6385.92s]  Surely the wolf.
[6385.92s -> 6387.28s]  You answer cheerfully.
[6387.28s -> 6389.36s]  It has wild strength and claws.
[6389.36s -> 6392.92s]  But a goblin has cunning and swordsmanship.
[6392.92s -> 6396.29s]  I have killed many of both.
[6396.29s -> 6398.21s]  Wolves are fearful creatures at heart.
[6398.21s -> 6399.80s]  You'll have to try it.
[6399.80s -> 6405.76s]  I have killed many of both.
[6405.76s -> 6408.88s]  We will ask the archmage to deliver one of each.
[6408.88s -> 6411.46s]  Decides a villager with a sigh.
[6411.46s -> 6414.87s]  In the name of learning and scholarship.
[6414.87s -> 6415.75s]  Uh oh.
[6415.75s -> 6419.96s]  These are archmage enthusiasts.
[6419.96s -> 6423.81s]  What is north of this village?
[6426.66s -> 6427.62s]  Tunnels.
[6427.62s -> 6428.64s]  One replies.
[6428.64s -> 6431.12s]  A few others look uncomfortable.
[6431.12s -> 6432.32s]  There are tunnels.
[6433.38s -> 6435.06s]  We don't go in there.
[6435.06s -> 6437.44s]  Why not?
[6440.28s -> 6441.40s]  Because there is no need.
[6442.20s -> 6443.96s]  And there are some dangers.
[6445.78s -> 6446.66s]  Wolves?
[6446.66s -> 6447.30s]  Goblins?
[6448.29s -> 6448.79s]  Wolves?
[6452.48s -> 6453.60s]  Something lives there.
[6454.24s -> 6456.80s]  There's no danger here in Karayama.
[6456.80s -> 6459.06s]  The archmage keeps us quite safe.
[6459.06s -> 6460.72s]  But under the mountain, well...
[6461.52s -> 6466.76s]  They say magic doesn't work under the mountain.
[6466.76s -> 6470.74s]  Where do the tunnels lead?
[6470.74s -> 6473.73s]  The villagers shake their heads.
[6473.73s -> 6475.09s]  One points sharply downwards.
[6475.09s -> 6476.77s]  But beyond that they do not answer.
[6478.72s -> 6480.34s]  Enough questions.
[6480.34s -> 6482.34s]  Please don't go to the tunnels.
[6482.34s -> 6484.66s]  We have no wish to send you to your doom.
[6484.66s -> 6488.96s]  Okay.
[6488.96s -> 6491.11s]  Talk to someone.
[6491.11s -> 6493.67s]  You sit down beside the woman who spoke earlier.
[6493.67s -> 6495.99s]  She nods in acknowledgement but says nothing.
[6495.99s -> 6499.67s]  This is a beautiful village.
[6501.83s -> 6505.72s]  The woman smiles and then pauses to tighten a bootlace.
[6505.72s -> 6510.12s]  A movement which casually flashes the marriage band on her wrist.
[6510.12s -> 6511.92s]  Thank you stranger.
[6511.92s -> 6513.38s]  We all welcome you.
[6513.38s -> 6519.00s]  This village is Karayama, the most beautiful village in Ishtara.
[6519.00s -> 6519.80s]  Enough talk.
[6520.20s -> 6522.55s]  Give me that thing to drink.
[6522.55s -> 6523.75s]  Wicked fast.
[6523.75s -> 6531.24s]  How might one cross the horns of Iklala?
[6531.24s -> 6537.35s]  You are so eager to leave already.
[6537.35s -> 6538.39s]  There's the bridge.
[6538.39s -> 6540.79s]  You'll have to pay the bridge keeper his toll of course.
[6540.79s -> 6542.71s]  But he rarely asks too much.
[6542.71s -> 6546.63s]  Is there another way?
[6546.63s -> 6548.31s]  I've heard it said that there are tunnels.
[6548.31s -> 6550.82s]  But they were all blocked up because of the pests.
[6551.81s -> 6553.41s]  What pests?
[6553.41s -> 6554.45s]  Invisible creatures.
[6554.45s -> 6557.73s]  They came in the night and stole our goats.
[6557.73s -> 6560.21s]  She kicks at the fire with one foot.
[6560.21s -> 6561.33s]  You talk a lot.
[6561.33s -> 6563.01s]  Is that normal where you're from?
[6563.01s -> 6567.20s]  I rarely see people.
[6567.28s -> 6569.52s]  I'm just trying to get my social meter up a little.
[6572.96s -> 6575.04s]  You're all strangely quiet.
[6575.04s -> 6578.05s]  Or so it seems to me.
[6578.05s -> 6579.91s]  We are a small village.
[6579.91s -> 6581.75s]  We see each other every day.
[6581.75s -> 6584.10s]  There's not that much to discuss.
[6584.10s -> 6585.60s]  You travel alone?
[6588.61s -> 6593.35s]  I do.
[6597.14s -> 6600.53s]  Well you are amongst us should you wish to stay.
[6600.53s -> 6603.65s]  Ishtara is the center of the world.
[6603.65s -> 6605.41s]  We will survive forever.
[6605.41s -> 6608.34s]  I do not think so.
[6609.06s -> 6611.94s]  You reply thinking of the empty waste you have already seen.
[6611.94s -> 6615.91s]  The woman looks at you curiously but does not reply.
[6615.91s -> 6617.35s]  Yeah, because this is back in the past.
[6617.35s -> 6619.97s]  So I know it's a wasteland now.
[6619.97s -> 6620.77s]  Survive.
[6620.77s -> 6621.25s]  Come on.
[6621.25s -> 6622.37s]  I'm talking a lot.
[6622.37s -> 6624.98s]  What can you tell me about the backlands?
[6624.98s -> 6627.38s]  The backlands?
[6627.38s -> 6632.85s]  That name seems unfamiliar to her.
[6632.85s -> 6633.65s]  Oh, okay.
[6634.21s -> 6635.41s]  It is of no importance.
[6635.41s -> 6639.81s]  It seems wherever you are this place is far removed from Kakabad.
[6639.81s -> 6643.19s]  At least for these people.
[6643.19s -> 6644.63s]  I'll throw a stick on the fire.
[6644.63s -> 6649.01s]  You toss a nearby stick into the fire and it begins to gently smoke and smolder.
[6649.01s -> 6650.77s]  There's a great sense of peace here.
[6650.77s -> 6654.82s]  You stand and nod to the woman as you head away from the fireside.
[6654.82s -> 6658.20s]  The sun is almost set and the sky has turned a deep purple.
[6658.20s -> 6661.54s]  Okay.
[6661.54s -> 6663.20s]  We've eaten.
[6663.20s -> 6664.48s]  Got a lot of rations.
[6664.48s -> 6665.51s]  Let's wait.
[6665.51s -> 6672.15s]  You pass a few hours in idling around the village until the sun dips behind the towering mountains
[6672.15s -> 6676.48s]  and the air grows cold.
[6676.48s -> 6677.76s]  Sleeping hut.
[6677.76s -> 6685.14s]  You head towards the large hut that is filled with mattresses and cots.
[6685.14s -> 6689.70s]  Seems to be not an inn but a communal sleeping place.
[6689.70s -> 6691.70s]  A few people are already asleep here.
[6691.70s -> 6695.57s]  I feel like this is potentially dangerous.
[6695.57s -> 6698.63s]  I feel like someone's going to steal something or attack me.
[6698.63s -> 6702.63s]  But I think I take my chances.
[6702.63s -> 6704.71s]  You choose a mattress and settle down.
[6704.71s -> 6706.95s]  You lie still for a while with your eyes closed,
[6706.95s -> 6710.66s]  listening to the murmured conversations of other people in the hut.
[6710.66s -> 6714.36s]  Amidst sundries about village life, one in particular stands out.
[6714.36s -> 6717.89s]  A young girl, murmuring to her friend,
[6717.89s -> 6720.37s]  At least one of the tunnels is still open.
[6720.37s -> 6724.85s]  Don't be a fool, Mia.
[6724.85s -> 6725.97s]  The other replies,
[6725.97s -> 6727.41s]  Why would there be tunnels?
[6727.41s -> 6731.01s]  So the goblins can come in?
[6731.01s -> 6732.53s]  I'm telling you, I saw one.
[6732.53s -> 6733.09s]  I went in.
[6733.57s -> 6736.68s]  Another voice nearby hisses at them to be quiet.
[6736.68s -> 6740.21s]  What do you know about...
[6740.77s -> 6741.89s]  Hey, what do you...
[6741.89s -> 6743.49s]  What do you kids know about tunnels?
[6744.76s -> 6749.28s]  You rise from your cot and find the one called Mia.
[6749.28s -> 6751.60s]  My apologies for overhearing your conversation.
[6752.16s -> 6754.64s]  These tunnels sound most interesting.
[6754.64s -> 6758.60s]  Do not be afraid, you assure her.
[6759.24s -> 6761.40s]  I'm merely an interested traveler.
[6761.40s -> 6764.05s]  The girl's friend has rolled over
[6764.05s -> 6766.29s]  and is pretending to have been asleep all this time.
[6768.13s -> 6769.89s]  I don't know anything about tunnels.
[6769.89s -> 6770.77s]  Please leave me alone.
[6772.58s -> 6775.84s]  I'm, um, I'm sorry.
[6776.96s -> 6777.76s]  I have money.
[6777.76s -> 6779.41s]  Important that you tell me.
[6779.41s -> 6793.62s]  I have money.
[6793.62s -> 6796.31s]  I can pay you for information you tell her.
[6796.31s -> 6798.37s]  Her eyes grow round with fear.
[6799.70s -> 6800.42s]  Who are you?
[6800.42s -> 6801.30s]  What are you doing here?
[6803.06s -> 6806.48s]  I am a sorcerer of great power.
[6807.04s -> 6810.64s]  Are you working for the goblins?
[6812.13s -> 6813.33s]  Are you a goblin?
[6813.89s -> 6815.17s]  Are you leading an invasion?
[6815.81s -> 6817.14s]  What? No.
[6817.14s -> 6820.82s]  Is an invasion expected?
[6821.38s -> 6824.40s]  My parents say the only reason we're still alive
[6824.72s -> 6826.88s]  is that the mountains are tall and goblins are short.
[6827.44s -> 6830.32s]  But goblins dig so they'll get us in the end.
[6832.32s -> 6833.76s]  Why are you asking about the tunnels?
[6836.12s -> 6838.55s]  I wish to protect the village.
[6838.55s -> 6841.43s]  The tunnels are a weakness that must be defended.
[6844.15s -> 6846.31s]  I'll take you tomorrow.
[6846.87s -> 6848.23s]  She kicks her friend.
[6848.23s -> 6849.11s]  I'll take both of you.
[6850.12s -> 6851.48s]  You nod and return to your cot.
[6852.28s -> 6854.12s]  There we go.
[6854.12s -> 6856.50s]  I'll eat something.
[6856.50s -> 6859.49s]  You eat a hunk of cooked meat and feel a little better.
[6859.49s -> 6860.93s]  All right, now we're doing better.
[6861.38s -> 6863.08s]  Then you stretch out and rest.
[6863.08s -> 6868.00s]  You are unharmed here and you do not dream.
[6868.00s -> 6874.12s]  All right, we're going to get some information to go through the tunnels.
[6874.12s -> 6876.20s]  You gain provisions, lost some gold,
[6876.20s -> 6879.16s]  enter the village of Kariyama, found no meat food.
[6879.16s -> 6884.13s]  The sun rises through the flaps of the hut.
[6884.13s -> 6888.00s]  The girl and her friend wake quickly and gesture at you to follow.
[6888.00s -> 6889.35s]  Follow them.
[6889.35s -> 6895.27s]  You follow them out of the hut and through the northern gate of the village.
[6895.27s -> 6896.15s]  Oh dear.
[6896.15s -> 6901.41s]  I hope I can protect these two.
[6902.68s -> 6907.32s]  The girl Mia leads you up to a tunnel mouth a short distance above the village.
[6907.32s -> 6909.40s]  Carefully hidden behind an outcrop of stone.
[6909.40s -> 6912.55s]  This used to be a mine.
[6912.55s -> 6915.35s]  Only they had to stop mining on account of the things.
[6915.35s -> 6918.00s]  I will kill the things.
[6918.56s -> 6919.44s]  You tell her.
[6919.44s -> 6920.96s]  The girl only shakes her head.
[6920.96s -> 6925.73s]  You think you're the first idiot with a sword to go in there?
[6925.73s -> 6929.09s]  But if you see my dog, give it a tickle for me.
[6930.77s -> 6931.57s]  Your dog?
[6933.92s -> 6937.68s]  Your dog lives in there?
[6937.68s -> 6940.24s]  My dog ran away in there, she says.
[6940.24s -> 6941.28s]  She never came back.
[6941.28s -> 6942.96s]  She sits down on a nearby rock.
[6942.96s -> 6944.56s]  Well, that's what I did.
[6944.56s -> 6946.60s]  I said it out loud.
[6946.68s -> 6957.76s]  Well, okay, into the tunnel.
[6957.76s -> 6963.64s]  You approach the tunnel mouth and lift away the covering of vines.
[6963.64s -> 6968.42s]  The passage descends dank and dark into the bowels of the mountains beyond.
[6968.42s -> 6973.94s]  I think I need to strike a light here.
[6973.94s -> 6977.22s]  I have Tinder, don't I?
[6977.22s -> 6977.78s]  Yep.
[6977.78s -> 6980.32s]  Your Tinder box can provide a spark.
[6980.32s -> 6982.16s]  You look through your pack for something to catch a light.
[6983.76s -> 6984.96s]  I'm not doing that.
[6985.68s -> 6987.20s]  Burn the spell book.
[6987.20s -> 6991.48s]  By the way, it's gone forever and you can't get it back.
[6991.48s -> 6992.76s]  Why would I burn my...
[6992.76s -> 6994.12s]  No, do something else.
[6994.12s -> 6995.64s]  That's so stupid that you can do that.
[6995.64s -> 6996.12s]  I love it.
[7002.15s -> 7003.19s]  Oh, I can't see.
[7003.19s -> 7007.11s]  Might as well burn the most important item in my backpack.
[7007.11s -> 7010.26s]  You cannot burn the spell book.
[7010.26s -> 7013.57s]  You'll have to find some other fuel or go without flame.
[7013.57s -> 7014.37s]  Just go.
[7014.37s -> 7016.61s]  I think I have a sun jewel.
[7016.61s -> 7021.25s]  The mountains overhead create an imposing sight.
[7021.25s -> 7024.53s]  You walk as though into an ancient tomb.
[7024.53s -> 7026.93s]  Even the air smells musty and old.
[7026.93s -> 7028.90s]  But there is a breeze on your hand.
[7028.90s -> 7038.84s]  Does that mean that there is a way through below ground?
[7038.84s -> 7040.60s]  Magic doesn't work under here.
[7040.60s -> 7041.56s]  Oh, that's right.
[7044.39s -> 7046.63s]  You make your way slowly through the narrow entrance.
[7046.63s -> 7048.93s]  And into the cool dark of the tunnel.
[7048.93s -> 7053.20s]  You hold out a hand to feel your way forward.
[7053.20s -> 7054.42s]  Cast a spell.
[7054.42s -> 7058.02s]  You raise your eyes up but it seems this deep below the mountain.
[7058.02s -> 7062.69s]  The presence of the starlight, kid, cannot reach you.
[7062.69s -> 7067.12s]  You're powerless, dude.
[7067.12s -> 7069.28s]  You try to make out something of the tunnel walls.
[7069.28s -> 7075.72s]  But the darkness is absolute.
[7075.72s -> 7077.46s]  Call out.
[7077.46s -> 7080.36s]  Is anyone there?
[7080.36s -> 7081.24s]  There is no response.
[7081.24s -> 7083.17s]  Not even an echo.
[7083.17s -> 7088.28s]  You follow the cold stone with your fingertips.
[7088.28s -> 7091.72s]  I'm gonna get out of here.
[7091.72s -> 7092.92s]  You stumble onwards.
[7092.92s -> 7095.00s]  Squinting in the gloom.
[7095.00s -> 7098.61s]  The tunnel winds on a steady course.
[7098.61s -> 7101.51s]  With occasional branches that lead to dead ends.
[7101.51s -> 7104.32s]  It becomes clear this is not a natural cavern.
[7104.32s -> 7107.44s]  Wooden pillars line the walls, creaking under the weight of stone.
[7107.44s -> 7109.89s]  Test the pillars.
[7109.89s -> 7113.81s]  You test one of the pillars for strength applying a little pressure.
[7113.81s -> 7116.53s]  It responds with a crunching, cracking sound.
[7117.09s -> 7119.57s]  And dust rains down in a spill.
[7119.57s -> 7122.69s]  So am I going to crush my head?
[7122.69s -> 7124.93s]  Push the pillar.
[7124.93s -> 7127.49s]  You put your weight against the pillar and heave.
[7127.49s -> 7132.36s]  The ancient wood cracks gratefully and rocks begin to tumble from the roof overhead.
[7132.36s -> 7134.37s]  You dash madly through the tunnel.
[7136.79s -> 7139.51s]  No, rewind, rewind, rewind, rewind.
[7139.51s -> 7140.96s]  That doesn't count.
[7140.96s -> 7145.54s]  Test the pillars.
[7145.54s -> 7150.40s]  Okay, press on.
[7150.40s -> 7151.04s]  Deeper.
[7151.04s -> 7158.96s]  Being careful not to lean on the pillar.
[7158.96s -> 7165.44s]  You keep one hand on the wall to your left and allow it to guide you.
[7165.44s -> 7168.32s]  Then your foot strikes something hard.
[7168.32s -> 7169.99s]  Not a rock.
[7169.99s -> 7171.91s]  A length of metal, perhaps.
[7171.91s -> 7173.84s]  Reach for it.
[7173.84s -> 7177.38s]  You reach down and feel for the object.
[7177.46s -> 7180.74s]  A long metal spike with a wooden pole at its center.
[7180.74s -> 7182.08s]  A pickaxe.
[7182.08s -> 7183.84s]  Someone has been mining down here.
[7183.84s -> 7187.65s]  A few steps further on you collide into a wooden wall
[7187.65s -> 7190.47s]  that reaches from knee height to neck height.
[7190.47s -> 7192.21s]  It appears to be on wheels.
[7192.21s -> 7193.33s]  A mine cart then.
[7193.33s -> 7197.12s]  Feel inside the cart.
[7197.12s -> 7200.64s]  You reach over and into the cart, hoping to find some treasure or valuable metal.
[7200.64s -> 7202.05s]  But it is empty.
[7202.05s -> 7207.43s]  There's not even any discarded rock.
[7207.43s -> 7209.76s]  Let's push it.
[7209.76s -> 7213.27s]  You push at the cart but it must have been here for an age.
[7213.27s -> 7216.52s]  It moves an inch and then the wheels stick fast.
[7216.52s -> 7220.04s]  The squeal of rusted iron echoes in the chamber like a scream.
[7220.04s -> 7222.92s]  Let's go.
[7222.92s -> 7225.89s]  You put your shoulder to the cart and push hard.
[7225.89s -> 7229.86s]  It overcomes whatever was catching on the wheel and begins to roll quickly forward.
[7229.86s -> 7233.36s]  A moment later it strikes something in the darkness.
[7233.36s -> 7235.36s]  One of the support pillars, perhaps?
[7235.36s -> 7237.44s]  Dust begins to trickle from the ceiling.
[7237.44s -> 7240.63s]  Wait to see what happens.
[7240.63s -> 7246.74s]  You stand frozen to the spot as the cavern echoes with ship-like yawns and creaks.
[7246.74s -> 7250.45s]  The stone shifts and fractures overhead and then falls silent.
[7250.45s -> 7252.87s]  The roof does not collapse this time.
[7252.87s -> 7256.21s]  You inch on through the darkness moving more cautiously now.
[7256.21s -> 7258.07s]  We're good.
[7258.07s -> 7264.21s]  You make your way slowly through the dark.
[7264.21s -> 7266.37s]  Soon your hand feels nothing but air.
[7266.37s -> 7267.73s]  A side passage.
[7267.73s -> 7272.64s]  The passage.
[7272.64s -> 7276.48s]  Empty darkness leads in three directions.
[7276.48s -> 7279.28s]  Is the ape here?
[7279.28s -> 7280.56s]  The ape is here.
[7280.56s -> 7284.66s]  Toss a stone into the passage.
[7284.66s -> 7286.50s]  Shout out or pray to the ape.
[7290.20s -> 7290.60s]  Okay.
[7290.60s -> 7292.04s]  This is very clearly.
[7292.04s -> 7294.95s]  This is a boss room, right?
[7294.95s -> 7297.09s]  There's a fog door here.
[7297.09s -> 7297.49s]  This is a...
[7300.15s -> 7300.79s]  I'm gonna go in there.
[7300.79s -> 7301.27s]  That's a...
[7301.27s -> 7308.50s]  Pray for protection.
[7308.50s -> 7313.25s]  You close your eyes and raise a prayer to the ape.
[7314.18s -> 7315.30s]  Nothing happens.
[7315.30s -> 7317.60s]  Have you been forgotten in the dark?
[7317.60s -> 7324.56s]  But as your eyes adjust, you notice something dimly glowing at the end of the side passage.
[7324.56s -> 7328.52s]  Is it the ape?
[7328.52s -> 7335.84s]  Move towards the glowing object.
[7335.84s -> 7339.59s]  You edge down the passage, your footsteps muffled by thick sand.
[7339.59s -> 7350.64s]  You trip over more abandoned and broken tools.
[7350.64s -> 7355.99s]  Then you're close enough to see a curved, golden object pointing from a pile of rubble.
[7355.99s -> 7359.81s]  This is the source of the light, which is pulsing softly.
[7359.81s -> 7363.97s]  Beside the pile of rubble are two large shapes that look like jars.
[7366.96s -> 7367.36s]  Scream!
[7368.08s -> 7375.32s]  Open up one of the jars and scream into it.
[7375.32s -> 7376.04s]  Uh...
[7376.04s -> 7384.80s]  Get a closer look at the artifact.
[7384.80s -> 7389.76s]  You edge around the jars as you get closer to the artifact.
[7389.76s -> 7390.80s]  It is a horn.
[7390.80s -> 7397.43s]  The dim glow makes the rest of the cavern dark and you trip and stumble as you approach.
[7397.43s -> 7403.20s]  Whatever it is, it is clear it is infused with magic and must be quite valuable.
[7403.20s -> 7407.38s]  But it seems to have been only halfway freed from the rock.
[7407.38s -> 7412.16s]  The wall feels smoother in places, like you're feeling a built wall instead of a tunnel.
[7412.85s -> 7414.77s]  The ground here also feels different.
[7414.77s -> 7420.29s]  I'm gonna grab the horn, it's gonna be attached to something.
[7420.29s -> 7429.20s]  Shift the rocks?
[7429.20s -> 7430.72s]  Move the jars aside?
[7430.72s -> 7433.62s]  Shift the rocks.
[7433.62s -> 7440.74s]  You squat down and move some rocks away from the artifact, all but dazzled by its light.
[7440.74s -> 7443.62s]  The glow is only gentle, but down here it is blinding.
[7446.13s -> 7446.61s]  Pull it free.
[7446.61s -> 7448.85s]  It's gonna be attached to something.
[7448.85s -> 7454.50s]  You grab the part of the horn that protrudes from the wall and pull, but it is firmly stuck.
[7454.50s -> 7455.92s]  Yank it!
[7455.92s -> 7458.88s]  You haul a little harder and it comes free suddenly,
[7458.88s -> 7462.29s]  sending you sprawling back across the sandy floor.
[7462.29s -> 7465.35s]  Blow the horn!
[7465.35s -> 7467.11s]  Let's not do that immediately.
[7467.11s -> 7468.15s]  Let's look at it.
[7468.15s -> 7472.63s]  You waste no time in examining the horn.
[7472.63s -> 7477.24s]  Hard to see any details as the glow blinds you in the darkness.
[7477.24s -> 7483.04s]  But you do make out some blocky script carved into it in a language you don't recognize.
[7483.04s -> 7487.78s]  The horn is also slightly warm to the touch.
[7487.78s -> 7488.74s]  Blow the horn.
[7488.74s -> 7494.29s]  You put the horn to your lips and blow.
[7494.29s -> 7495.41s]  Nothing happens.
[7495.41s -> 7498.82s]  It is as though the horn is blocked.
[7498.82s -> 7503.24s]  As you tip it up to empty it, you notice the nearest clay jar wobbling.
[7503.24s -> 7505.88s]  It rocks back and forth faster and faster.
[7505.88s -> 7508.18s]  Then the lid shoots off.
[7508.18s -> 7509.44s]  Cover my head.
[7509.44s -> 7514.96s]  You cover your head, but the lid strikes the low roof with such force it turns to powder.
[7514.96s -> 7517.44s]  But the real danger is just beginning.
[7517.44s -> 7520.72s]  Sand rushes out of the jar with tremendous force,
[7520.72s -> 7522.96s]  whipping around the cavern tripping you to the ground.
[7522.96s -> 7526.45s]  Scramble back.
[7526.45s -> 7529.73s]  You scramble backwards across the ground trying to get away
[7529.73s -> 7533.20s]  As the sand forms into a whirlpool-like shape,
[7533.20s -> 7538.32s]  two deep black vortices appear in its sides and roam queasily across the surface until
[7538.32s -> 7539.67s]  they reach the top.
[7539.67s -> 7547.84s]  There they swivel, widen, and seem to focus on you.
[7547.84s -> 7552.80s]  You deftly leap forward and swing your sword, but it passes clean through the monster.
[7552.80s -> 7555.09s]  It barely even notices.
[7555.09s -> 7556.61s]  Uh, look for something to use.
[7556.61s -> 7560.85s]  The pickaxe.
[7560.85s -> 7567.27s]  You cast about looking for some advantage and your eye lands on a discarded pickaxe.
[7567.27s -> 7568.95s]  I can't hurt- that's not gonna do anything.
[7568.95s -> 7570.77s]  I gotta run.
[7570.77s -> 7573.17s]  Surely a pickaxe cannot harm this thing.
[7573.17s -> 7575.97s]  You turn, intending to run, and the creature follows you.
[7575.97s -> 7580.18s]  The vortex passes the discarded pickaxe and gathers it up
[7580.18s -> 7584.66s]  until handle and head swirling around inside of its body at violent speed
[7584.66s -> 7588.66s]  before being smashed to pieces and spraying in all directions.
[7588.66s -> 7591.11s]  The sand vortex is very close now.
[7591.11s -> 7593.86s]  It is cornering you against a pillar.
[7593.86s -> 7597.46s]  Looking around wildly in the dark, you can't think of anything.
[7597.46s -> 7600.34s]  You take a few steps back and feel hard stone at your back.
[7600.34s -> 7601.78s]  The creature expands.
[7601.78s -> 7604.23s]  Is this how it ends?
[7604.23s -> 7606.42s]  Shield yourself.
[7606.42s -> 7608.74s]  You cover your head, expecting the fatal blow.
[7608.74s -> 7615.06s]  But before the creature can strike, the tunnel rumbles with holy vengeance.
[7615.06s -> 7617.70s]  Rocks crash down from the ceiling, burying it.
[7617.70s -> 7619.38s]  You've been saved by the ape!
[7619.38s -> 7621.46s]  But the tunnel rumble-
[7622.90s -> 7624.66s]  But the rumble is still there.
[7624.66s -> 7629.89s]  A few more boulders crash, narrowly, just barely missing your ass.
[7629.89s -> 7631.91s]  The tunnel is collapsing with you in it.
[7631.91s -> 7638.18s]  Good thing we prayed.
[7638.18s -> 7640.40s]  Run.
[7640.40s -> 7642.96s]  You dodge aside as rocks crash down around you.
[7642.96s -> 7644.64s]  The creature is close behind.
[7644.64s -> 7647.60s]  But then the ceiling caves in at your heels, burying it.
[7647.60s -> 7651.84s]  In your haste, you trip on a broken cart and the glowing horn goes flying.
[7651.84s -> 7654.72s]  It lands nearby, but the tunnel is still rumbling.
[7654.72s -> 7656.85s]  I have to get it.
[7656.85s -> 7659.25s]  You leap towards the horn, landing on your knees.
[7659.25s -> 7665.25s]  You reach out, but not before a massive rock slams on it, grinding the horn into fine powder.
[7665.25s -> 7666.20s]  What?
[7666.20s -> 7670.04s]  Whatever secrets the miners were looking for will have to stay buried now.
[7670.04s -> 7671.88s]  There's no time for disappointment.
[7672.13s -> 7674.60s]  Though as the ceiling is still caving in.
[7674.60s -> 7675.08s]  What?
[7675.08s -> 7676.48s]  Roll left.
[7676.48s -> 7678.88s]  You wince as the ceiling crashes down, missing you by inches.
[7678.88s -> 7680.64s]  Dust settles and you can't hear anything.
[7680.64s -> 7682.00s]  There's no turning back now.
[7682.00s -> 7683.28s]  You're trapped in the dark.
[7683.28s -> 7688.10s]  Snort the powder.
[7691.70s -> 7693.86s]  I have to have whatever secrets it is.
[7693.86s -> 7697.22s]  You slam your head, as hard as you can, into the ground.
[7697.22s -> 7699.94s]  And breathe in as deeply with your nostrils as possible.
[7703.24s -> 7708.08s]  A sense of wind fills inside of your stomach.
[7708.08s -> 7709.04s]  Uh, okay.
[7709.04s -> 7710.63s]  Can I still get-
[7710.63s -> 7711.27s]  No.
[7711.27s -> 7715.73s]  It's over.
[7715.73s -> 7717.70s]  You are in pitch darkness.
[7717.70s -> 7720.02s]  Whether it is night or day, it is impossible to tell.
[7720.02s -> 7721.78s]  The air is freezing cold.
[7721.78s -> 7726.47s]  Strike a light.
[7726.47s -> 7728.96s]  I'm not gonna burn my spell book.
[7728.96s -> 7734.15s]  You feel about until you find the tunnel wall.
[7734.15s -> 7735.03s]  Cast a spell?
[7735.03s -> 7740.00s]  I can't cast spells down here.
[7740.00s -> 7743.03s]  I need to just follow.
[7743.03s -> 7748.68s]  You follow the rough stone wall, stumbling and tripping until you come to a blockage.
[7748.68s -> 7750.44s]  Feel the stones.
[7750.44s -> 7756.34s]  You feel your way across the stones, hoping to find a chink or a hole, but there's nothing.
[7756.34s -> 7758.90s]  Sound of something groaning echoes down the tunnel length.
[7758.90s -> 7762.10s]  Strike a light.
[7762.10s -> 7764.64s]  I'm not burning the spell book.
[7764.64s -> 7769.09s]  You cannot burn the spell book, you'll have to find some other fuel.
[7769.09s -> 7770.10s]  All right.
[7770.10s -> 7770.66s]  The other way.
[7770.66s -> 7773.12s]  Am I stuck down here?
[7773.12s -> 7774.16s]  You trace the wall the other way.
[7774.16s -> 7776.16s]  The passageway curves immense.
[7776.16s -> 7778.64s]  The going is difficult with lots of dead ends.
[7778.64s -> 7780.80s]  Then finally, a chink of daylight appears.
[7780.80s -> 7783.12s]  It's like water after a long thirst.
[7783.12s -> 7787.91s]  You have found the tunnel mouth.
[7787.91s -> 7788.87s]  Leave the tunnel.
[7788.87s -> 7792.36s]  You hurry gratefully out of the tunnel into the soft damp air.
[7792.36s -> 7793.96s]  Where are you?
[7793.96s -> 7795.91s]  Outside.
[7795.91s -> 7796.41s]  Ah!
[7800.69s -> 7808.80s]  This is- you can get up through this way, okay.
[7808.80s -> 7810.56s]  I want that horn so bad.
[7810.56s -> 7816.45s]  Oh well.
[7816.45s -> 7821.49s]  You emerge blinking from the underground tunnel to find yourself on the edge of a vast, deep forest.
[7821.49s -> 7826.50s]  From the position of the sun, you can see that you're on the other side of the Badubak Ridge.
[7826.50s -> 7830.02s]  Only one way forward into the trees.
[7830.02s -> 7832.76s]  So, you could go this way.
[7832.76s -> 7835.09s]  You could also go all the way up here and do all this.
[7835.09s -> 7836.21s]  Didn't get the horn.
[7836.21s -> 7837.09s]  That's disappointing.
[7837.09s -> 7839.09s]  I wonder if there's anything else I missed up here.
[7839.09s -> 7841.78s]  It is what it is.
[7841.78s -> 7843.89s]  The ape saved us.
[7843.89s -> 7847.56s]  Probably would have died.
[7847.56s -> 7848.20s]  Very cool.
[7848.20s -> 7853.27s]  Can't go back to the village either.
[7853.27s -> 7856.96s]  We're going to move on this way.
[7856.96s -> 7860.96s]  Uh, I'm going to go check this out.
[7860.96s -> 7865.36s]  Very big town here.
[7865.36s -> 7870.65s]  This way.
[7872.28s -> 7876.24s]  No horn and no dog.
[7876.24s -> 7881.86s]  Yeah, I didn't find the dog and I didn't, um, I didn't get the horn either.
[7881.86s -> 7882.98s]  Forest turns to marsh.
[7882.98s -> 7888.10s]  The ground underfoot turns to slop until you are sinking a few fingers deep with every step.
[7888.10s -> 7890.63s]  The smell of rot and decay fills the air.
[7890.63s -> 7892.79s]  Let's keep going.
[7892.79s -> 7895.89s]  You keep up your pace, hoping the ground will grow firmer further on.
[7895.89s -> 7905.00s]  So, we're going back to the present.
[7905.00s -> 7906.04s]  And no ring either.
[7906.04s -> 7906.60s]  I know.
[7906.60s -> 7907.78s]  What a failure.
[7907.78s -> 7915.09s]  So, this was in the past and now we're back into the present.
[7916.85s -> 7917.81s]  What is this?
[7917.81s -> 7921.70s]  No horn, no dog, no ring, no finger.
[7931.24s -> 7932.79s]  Uh, no.
[7934.95s -> 7942.21s]  I just spilled all over myself.
[7942.21s -> 7949.57s]  You wade on through the marsh which changes to firmer earth beneath your feet.
[7949.57s -> 7953.49s]  Trees grow up around you and suddenly you find yourself in the forest once more.
[7953.49s -> 7957.12s]  The sun has reached its highest point now.
[7957.12s -> 7959.68s]  Out of the shade, the air is baking hot.
[7959.68s -> 7964.63s]  By day, the forest is still not a hospitable place, but it's beautiful in its own way.
[7964.63s -> 7967.70s]  Water drips down the leaves and along twisted vines.
[7967.70s -> 7971.14s]  Birds flutter through the bracken-like canopy.
[7971.14s -> 7973.19s]  Everything is moist and damp.
[7973.19s -> 7976.37s]  The path is winding and frequently disappears.
[7976.37s -> 7979.67s]  Perhaps it has been made by animals and not by people.
[7979.67s -> 7983.81s]  Let's climb a tree.
[7983.81s -> 7988.68s]  You find a suitable looking tree, close at hand, and swing yourself onto the lower branch.
[7988.68s -> 7993.04s]  From there, it is a reasonably straightforward climb up into the canopy.
[7993.04s -> 8001.11s]  You reach the top of the tree, but there is no view.
[8001.11s -> 8005.20s]  From here, you can see nothing but more trees stretching away into the distance.
[8005.20s -> 8006.72s]  The only exception is to the south,
[8006.72s -> 8010.64s]  where the stone arch of the bridge rises up in a dizzying height into the air.
[8010.64s -> 8012.56s]  There is little else to be done up here.
[8012.56s -> 8016.36s]  Look at the ground.
[8016.36s -> 8021.68s]  You glance down the tree towards the ground just as something moves past on the path below.
[8021.68s -> 8023.44s]  Leaves stir, the shape is gone.
[8023.44s -> 8026.37s]  You make your way carefully back down to the ground,
[8026.37s -> 8030.60s]  but halfway down, one of the branches cracks under your weight.
[8030.60s -> 8032.08s]  Cling on.
[8032.08s -> 8035.36s]  You cling onto the branch overhead as your foothold disappears.
[8035.36s -> 8039.56s]  For a moment, you are dangling free.
[8039.56s -> 8041.52s]  Swing to a branch.
[8041.52s -> 8043.04s]  Moving like a monkey.
[8044.13s -> 8045.44s]  Thank you, ape.
[8045.44s -> 8048.00s]  You swing backwards and forwards until you have enough arc
[8048.00s -> 8050.98s]  to try and catch another branch with your feet.
[8050.98s -> 8052.74s]  You hook yourself into position,
[8052.74s -> 8057.99s]  and then move one of your hands closer until you are steadily placed once more.
[8057.99s -> 8059.56s]  Okay.
[8059.56s -> 8061.57s]  You take a moment to gather your breath.
[8061.57s -> 8069.76s]  In the pause, the branch underneath you breaks and you fall, of course.
[8069.76s -> 8073.28s]  You hit the ground with a thump, but the earth is soft.
[8073.28s -> 8076.05s]  You are fortunately unhurt.
[8076.05s -> 8081.41s]  Near the foot of the tree is a broken branch and a slightly bruised bomba fruit.
[8081.41s -> 8083.22s]  Ooh.
[8083.30s -> 8085.30s]  You must have knocked it from the tree when you fell.
[8085.30s -> 8088.74s]  It's a little bruised, but still seems edible.
[8088.74s -> 8089.86s]  Uh, yeah.
[8089.86s -> 8091.65s]  Thank you.
[8091.65s -> 8093.89s]  Bomba fruit are particularly nutritious,
[8093.89s -> 8096.26s]  and this one is in good shape despite its fall.
[8096.26s -> 8097.54s]  Pick it up and put it in your pack.
[8097.54s -> 8099.99s]  You are beginning to feel hungry.
[8099.99s -> 8103.46s]  I'm just gonna eat it.
[8103.46s -> 8112.04s]  Let's eat it.
[8112.04s -> 8114.52s]  Actually, maybe I should eat the meat first.
[8114.52s -> 8115.64s]  Don't go bad.
[8115.64s -> 8119.80s]  There we go.
[8119.80s -> 8128.44s]  Fruit will go bad sooner than meat?
[8128.44s -> 8130.79s]  Uh, oh well.
[8130.79s -> 8133.43s]  You trace what might be a path and might be an old river,
[8133.43s -> 8135.83s]  though through the trees of the forest.
[8135.83s -> 8138.63s]  Slowly, the sun begins to lower in the sky.
[8138.63s -> 8140.79s]  The trees are alive with movement.
[8140.79s -> 8145.03s]  You catch a glimpse of a bright red snake through the trees.
[8145.03s -> 8147.14s]  It seems to be watching you.
[8147.14s -> 8151.43s]  Approach the snake.
[8151.43s -> 8156.60s]  You approach the snake, but it slips away between the trees.
[8156.60s -> 8162.05s]  A pile of boulders here is topped by a patch of curious bright yellow moss.
[8162.05s -> 8166.23s]  Gather the moss.
[8166.23s -> 8168.47s]  Intrigued, you grab a fistful of the moss.
[8168.47s -> 8173.28s]  It is juicy and extremely pungent.
[8173.28s -> 8180.60s]  Smell it, taste it, stash it, toss it, bop it, twist it, smell it, taste it,
[8180.60s -> 8182.92s]  toss it, stash it.
[8182.92s -> 8184.84s]  Uh, what do I do?
[8184.84s -> 8188.39s]  I think I have a memory of this.
[8188.39s -> 8195.72s]  I feel like there's an incorrect one to do here.
[8195.72s -> 8198.77s]  I'm gonna, I'll taste it.
[8198.77s -> 8201.97s]  You taste the moss with a tentative tongue.
[8201.97s -> 8206.60s]  The flavor is not pleasant, but it does not appear acrid.
[8206.60s -> 8209.01s]  Perhaps it is not poisonous.
[8209.01s -> 8212.28s]  Smell it.
[8212.28s -> 8215.43s]  You put your nose deep into the moss.
[8215.43s -> 8216.95s]  Why would you go that close?
[8216.95s -> 8223.99s]  The scent is like lemons and strong cheese and manure all rolled together.
[8223.99s -> 8228.07s]  It reminds you of the smell of drinking water in curry.
[8228.07s -> 8230.02s]  The effect is heady.
[8230.02s -> 8239.54s]  I'll stash it.
[8239.54s -> 8240.42s]  I'll stash it.
[8240.42s -> 8244.36s]  You store the moss in your pack, but it quickly dries and crumbles to dust.
[8244.36s -> 8244.92s]  What?
[8244.92s -> 8246.26s]  Rewind.
[8246.26s -> 8261.54s]  Okay.
[8261.54s -> 8263.57s]  Eat it.
[8263.57s -> 8267.48s]  Feeling bolder, you put the clump of moss into your mouth and chew.
[8267.48s -> 8270.42s]  Thick yellow juices run down your chin.
[8270.42s -> 8273.92s]  Swallowing the thick clump is hard, but almost as soon as you do,
[8273.92s -> 8276.80s]  you feel a great warmth spreading up from your stomach.
[8276.80s -> 8279.62s]  Whatever this moss is, it seems to be most beneficial.
[8279.62s -> 8284.42s]  Good thing I, um, save scummed.
[8284.42s -> 8293.11s]  Yeah, how I usually do it, I know it doesn't really matter,
[8293.11s -> 8297.59s]  but typically I'll give myself like three or four rewinds a stream.
[8297.59s -> 8300.82s]  Makes it more fun.
[8300.82s -> 8302.64s]  Also, it is a feature of the game.
[8302.64s -> 8303.20s]  That's right.
[8303.20s -> 8308.39s]  Depends how I'm feeling.
[8308.39s -> 8310.31s]  Things move in the canopy all around you.
[8310.31s -> 8312.23s]  The sun is dropping down to the west.
[8312.23s -> 8314.07s]  It will be night soon.
[8314.07s -> 8317.22s]  You emerge from the trees into a clearing by a low hill.
[8317.22s -> 8318.66s]  This is an exposed place.
[8319.22s -> 8321.06s]  You would be unwise to stay long.
[8327.97s -> 8328.93s]  Uh-huh.
[8328.93s -> 8334.79s]  You skirt around the north side of the hillock.
[8334.79s -> 8337.54s]  There's something quite artificial about its shape.
[8337.70s -> 8339.54s]  Its sides are almost perfectly smooth.
[8339.54s -> 8343.70s]  Look around.
[8343.70s -> 8346.18s]  There is definitely something strange about this hill.
[8346.18s -> 8349.92s]  You decide to make a full circuit to see what you can find.
[8349.92s -> 8352.10s]  As you pass the southeast side of the hillock,
[8352.10s -> 8356.36s]  you come across an incongruous wooden doorway
[8356.36s -> 8359.28s]  set into the curvature of the hill.
[8359.28s -> 8360.32s]  Look at the door.
[8360.32s -> 8363.75s]  You step over to the doorway to examine it more closely.
[8363.75s -> 8371.40s]  Wouldn't you like to know what's in there?
[8371.40s -> 8375.59s]  Wouldn't you be intrigued to know what could be inside of this?
[8375.59s -> 8377.43s]  What troubles do we see?
[8379.40s -> 8383.35s]  What difficulties do you imagine?
[8390.20s -> 8398.50s]  Mods, put a poll up, please, into the stream voice.
[8399.64s -> 8400.84s]  Don't cliffhanger it.
[8400.84s -> 8403.73s]  I'm going to cliffhanger it.
[8403.73s -> 8406.45s]  I'm going to cliffhanger it because if you're interested,
[8406.45s -> 8407.33s]  that means you'll come back.
[8413.78s -> 8414.98s]  The whole screen shifting?
[8414.98s -> 8415.78s]  Yeah, it's because I haven't.
[8415.78s -> 8416.34s]  There we go.
[8418.05s -> 8418.77s]  All right, here's a poll.
[8420.88s -> 8423.04s]  I really want to continue playing this.
[8423.04s -> 8426.16s]  I also really want to continue playing Final Fantasy 16.
[8431.41s -> 8440.13s]  On Monday, would you prefer Final Fantasy 16 or Sorcery?
[8440.69s -> 8447.54s]  Could also do both.
[8448.42s -> 8449.06s]  That's true.
[8453.20s -> 8455.20s]  That's actually accurate.
[8455.20s -> 8456.00s]  Could just do both.
[8458.55s -> 8460.39s]  Yeah, no, don't even do a poll.
[8460.39s -> 8461.11s]  Not even necessary.
[8462.93s -> 8468.24s]  We'll play Final Fantasy 16 for a little while.
[8468.24s -> 8470.08s]  Maybe like same thing, like two or three hours,
[8470.08s -> 8471.92s]  and then come over here for two or three hours.
[8473.38s -> 8477.54s]  Plus, I think Sorcery also is a more chilled out experience
[8477.54s -> 8478.66s]  where I just kind of read.
[8480.69s -> 8482.13s]  That can happen later on in the night time.
[8487.32s -> 8489.00s]  Yeah, we don't have to do a poll.
[8489.00s -> 8489.64s]  Both works.
[8490.44s -> 8492.12s]  Two or three hours each.
[8492.68s -> 8496.47s]  Everybody's playing Final Fantasy 16.
[8497.70s -> 8500.42s]  Yeah, but if I don't play it on stream,
[8500.42s -> 8501.86s]  I'm going to play it off stream.
[8501.86s -> 8510.79s]  Yeah, we'll do both.
[8515.99s -> 8517.35s]  Only 5% want...
[8517.35s -> 8518.95s]  Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8521.44s -> 8526.16s]  I feel like all the people that are here want Sorcery.
[8526.16s -> 8528.56s]  All the people that would want Final Fantasy 16
[8528.56s -> 8530.40s]  are probably not here right now.
[8530.40s -> 8539.48s]  But, you know, I love this game.
[8540.56s -> 8544.40s]  Sorry, it took me 295 days to come back to play it,
[8544.40s -> 8546.00s]  but we're going to continue it on Monday.
[8546.56s -> 8559.08s]  So what do you guys think?
[8559.08s -> 8561.54s]  I know you got kind of dropped right in the middle of that,
[8561.54s -> 8565.43s]  but what do you guys think?
[8568.00s -> 8569.28s]  That was your first experience seeing it?
[8569.84s -> 8573.86s]  I think it's cool.
[8576.23s -> 8578.23s]  I will tell you that I'm a little sad
[8578.23s -> 8582.69s]  that you're involved in the third game.
[8583.41s -> 8588.37s]  Because I think the second game is, like, in top...
[8589.81s -> 8592.37s]  It's the best one, without a doubt.
[8593.51s -> 8595.43s]  But if you like the characters,
[8595.43s -> 8596.63s]  which the characters are all really cool,
[8597.35s -> 8600.55s]  the third game just kind of keeps expanding on places to go.
[8601.51s -> 8603.35s]  I think there's more to see in the third game,
[8604.07s -> 8605.75s]  but the second game I think has a lot more...
[8605.75s -> 8606.95s]  I like the second game the most.
[8607.67s -> 8609.97s]  I still very much enjoy them.
[8609.97s -> 8612.85s]  Third is probably up there, close to number two.
[8613.49s -> 8618.26s]  Yeah, we'll see you Monday.
[8619.67s -> 8621.35s]  Have a great rest of your weekend.
[8621.35s -> 8624.04s]  There's not much left of it, but enjoy it.
[8625.70s -> 8627.38s]  I'll be here Monday around four,
[8628.10s -> 8631.73s]  and then somewhere around, like, six to seven.
[8631.73s -> 8632.93s]  Maybe, like, around six-ish.
[8633.73s -> 8635.49s]  We'll do some chill sorcery vibes.
[8636.21s -> 8641.94s]  You actually like the second game more,
[8641.94s -> 8643.30s]  or do you just get burnt out by...
[8643.30s -> 8645.06s]  No, I don't get burnt out from this game.
[8645.70s -> 8650.77s]  Part two is genuinely the best out of all of them, without a doubt.
[8650.77s -> 8651.49s]  Kari is just...
[8652.29s -> 8654.21s]  There's so much going on in Kari.
[8660.21s -> 8662.85s]  So we'll start for Final Fantasy XVI,
[8663.81s -> 8665.97s]  and then we'll move to sorcery around, like, six or seven.
[8666.61s -> 8668.36s]  For chill sorcery vibes.
[8668.92s -> 8670.90s]  Have a great night.
[8670.90s -> 8671.62s]  See you later.
[8671.62s -> 8672.34s]  See you in a couple days.
[8675.25s -> 8676.13s]  Have a great one.
[8677.78s -> 8678.34s]  Call your mother.
[8678.98s -> 8685.16s]  Eat a couple green vegetables today, you know.
[8686.87s -> 8689.35s]  Substitute out the bacon for, you know, some greens.
[8689.35s -> 8689.91s]  Just today.
[8689.91s -> 8691.35s]  You know, once or twice a week.
[8691.91s -> 8696.28s]  Have a glass of water if you haven't had one.
[8696.84s -> 8699.19s]  Get some sleep.
[8706.69s -> 8712.37s]  You know, I'm eating bacon right now.
[8713.01s -> 8716.74s]  Why would I eat vegetables right now?
[8716.74s -> 8717.70s]  It's like 1 a.m.
[8717.70s -> 8718.74s]  It's midnight here.
[8718.74s -> 8719.54s]  It's 1 a.m.
[8723.48s -> 8724.92s]  It's really windy where you are.
[8724.92s -> 8725.40s]  Yeah, it is.
[8726.04s -> 8727.86s]  All right, take care, guys.
[8727.86s -> 8728.90s]  See you soon.
[8728.90s -> 8731.08s]  Have a good rest of your night.
