[1.08s -> 13.69s]  Hey, good afternoon. Hi, everybody. How's your day gone so far? Mine's good, I'm a little heavy.
[14.25s -> 23.13s]  Just a little. That probably needs some explanation. In fact, it feels like I'm a softball,
[23.69s -> 32.81s]  like in my stomach right now. Just a little heavy, you know, a little bloated, but it's okay. I've got
[32.81s -> 47.24s]  some nice tea here. It's not tea, it's coffee. The laxatives haven't kicked in yet. Well, that's the
[47.24s -> 55.80s]  thing. They have, they have very much so. It's been, it's been very fun, but they're not even,
[55.80s -> 60.92s]  okay, I don't want to get into this. It's not like what you think when you think of that word.
[61.64s -> 68.26s]  Trust me, it's not what you think it is. There's like a, there's comedy, you know, comedy like
[68.26s -> 77.77s]  laxative. No, that's not, it's not what's happening. If you've seen any movie from like 1992 to like
[77.77s -> 92.66s]  1998, there was a, it's not like that. I mean, some of them could be,
[93.30s -> 109.08s]  but this one isn't. I literally just joined. Anyways, that's a good way to start this stream.
[109.96s -> 117.16s]  Why don't we bring in the two special guests? It's Star and Ashley. I think I said that before
[117.24s -> 122.15s]  muting, unmuting. I said Star and Ashley. Here they are.
[127.18s -> 139.94s]  Hey, Ashley. I muted at the wrong time. I unmuted at the wrong time. But yeah, we're going to do
[139.94s -> 160.55s]  Trine, Trine 4. Wait, what? I thought, I thought this is three people. What? How does that, doesn't
[160.55s -> 172.04s]  it break the game? And then once you get to six, once you get to Trine 6, it's 3 v 3.
[172.68s -> 178.84s]  No, there's not that many people in the world. Trine like six is just like a 3 v 3,
[178.84s -> 183.08s]  it's like Dota game. Yeah. And the developers are pissed off about it because they want to make it,
[183.08s -> 185.64s]  but they have to make Trine 5 first so that the joke works.
[188.49s -> 196.44s]  So I remember we did this, we did a video on this. Yeah. Finally, I got to be one of Steve's videos.
[196.44s -> 200.28s]  That is one of the most popular videos you and I have ever done together.
[200.84s -> 204.84s]  Yeah. I was just saying before this, how recently like today I walked into a McDonald's and they
[204.84s -> 209.32s]  were showing it on the screen. Yeah. I couldn't believe it. Yeah. It's ridiculous. I know.
[210.12s -> 215.08s]  That's weird because I was at, I was at a Burger King two days ago and they was showing this video
[215.08s -> 222.65s]  too. Really? Yeah. That's his joke. He just took that right from him. What the fuck? You can't do
[222.65s -> 229.37s]  that. Steve, you can't let him do that. Okay. Mine wasn't a joke. Is yours a joke? Or did yours
[229.37s -> 235.61s]  also really happen? Just like, just steal your joke in front of you. Yeah. Yeah. That's bad.
[235.61s -> 240.97s]  That's, that's just how we do it. Come on. Come on, Rowdy. Cut it out. Are we starting the game, Rowdy?
[242.49s -> 248.39s]  Yeah, I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay. Okay. And by the way, my name is KettleCorn. Call me KettleCorn.
[248.39s -> 253.99s]  What do you mean KettleCorn? My name is Frozen Buttwagon. Once upon a time, Amadeus the wizard
[254.15s -> 262.36s]  was waking up in a cottage. I got a sweet spot for like wizard voices. Attending a wizard.
[262.36s -> 269.82s]  My volume's too low. What if I hit escape button? And that morning, he decided a trip to the mail
[269.82s -> 276.46s]  box. He has flashes on his shelf. Even if this box was located at a very inconvenient distance,
[277.42s -> 288.09s]  time to find that mailbox. Wait, who does? Okay. No, I don't want W-A-S-D. Why are we all wizards?
[288.81s -> 298.54s]  I don't have a hat. Why do I get a hat? My control was plugged in. Why did they make me the pink one?
[298.54s -> 302.38s]  This is the tutorial. You remember? You got to play each hero one at a time.
[303.74s -> 307.02s]  Now we're all wizards. Remember when we were on the beach? And I, cause I know,
[307.02s -> 314.44s]  cause I just saw this from the McDonald's. Wait, what? Hold left and okay. I'm ready. Right.
[317.24s -> 322.52s]  So get on the cube. Do I have to do these on screen to get them off the screen without A and D?
[323.24s -> 326.60s]  Actually, we could just walk out the door, but we have to walk out the door.
[329.24s -> 334.12s]  What? Oh, which one? Oh, I'm purple. Dude, I got the Twitch. I got the Twitch skin.
[337.18s -> 342.87s]  I think it actually is zoom in. No, it's not. Is it zoom in? Oh, there is a zoom. I'm zooming.
[342.87s -> 351.38s]  Is there, how do you zoom? Look at my shoulder. Hey Rowdy. What's up? How are you? Oh, I got a thing.
[351.38s -> 354.74s]  Okay. That's how you do that. They, they nerfed the wizard. I was saying,
[354.74s -> 358.26s]  because normally you make, you draw a square and the square appears there,
[358.26s -> 362.26s]  but now it's always over your head. And also if you jump on your own square,
[362.26s -> 366.82s]  then you can't manipulate your own square for a duration after touching your square. You guys are,
[367.70s -> 373.06s]  you guys are training, aren't you? Yeah. All right. So A is jump. I've gotten that far.
[375.06s -> 381.06s]  No, it's space bar. What? I have a controller. I have a controller. I don't care.
[381.94s -> 391.58s]  Yeah. A-W-A-S-A jump. Break them. Oh, there's instructions. Cool. He has to do this every time
[391.58s -> 395.02s]  he leaves his home. That tree just keeps growing. What about the, what about the secret up there?
[396.23s -> 400.95s]  You got to smash it. Yeah. Nice. So you get what? Three of these in a level or something?
[401.67s -> 408.25s]  Do we all, I think we all have to use our power at the same time. No, one person should be able
[408.25s -> 412.65s]  to do this. Come on. If you weren't touching it, I think you could just lift it. Well, somebody put
[413.21s -> 424.92s]  up. Oh, why is there a snowball in here? Oh, we're losing them. We're losing them.
[426.28s -> 432.84s]  Run. Hurry. Oh, get up. Highlight levitation objects and then switch targets. Okay. So if you,
[432.84s -> 438.44s]  I get it. I'm trying to give you my box, but it doesn't fit through.
[438.44s -> 441.96s]  All right. Somebody left that and stick it in the way like the traffic game. Good work.
[442.68s -> 448.31s]  Oh, here. Here's the, here's the secret technique.
[451.98s -> 460.46s]  Get off. No, you guys are doing the centipede from Super Mario Brothers to me. Get this out of here.
[462.44s -> 467.24s]  Thank you. I'm so good at balancing snow. Wow. This doesn't look like it should be possible.
[468.28s -> 473.91s]  When is it going to come to life?
[473.91s -> 482.25s]  It's like start screaming. Yeah, I know. It's a very, it's a very nice looking game.
[485.43s -> 488.07s]  Well, I turned my graphics down all the way. So it looks like I'm a little weird.
[488.71s -> 494.89s]  You can do it, honey. So we're going to have to go through each chapter as the,
[495.93s -> 498.97s]  the first level is going to be each character. Yeah. It makes sense.
[499.69s -> 507.35s]  Okay. You can rotate. Oh, all right. That's cool. I'm the wizard. I've always been the wizard and
[507.35s -> 512.31s]  I'll continue. Yeah, I got it. We have a side role. If you put weight on something,
[513.83s -> 519.27s]  it falls. Yeah. They nerf the wizards. But if you go fast, it doesn't matter.
[523.90s -> 530.84s]  There you go. I mean, I think we need one of those. How did you get it? What though? I guess I think
[530.84s -> 538.70s]  we're supposed to use that here. Nah, but it's okay. Again, I stress this is his trip to his
[538.70s -> 544.22s]  mailbox every day. All right. This is a puzzle. Everyone worked together with our brains.
[549.91s -> 557.30s]  Stick that up. Wait, did you already leave? Yeah. Are we supposed to be doing puzzles together? You
[557.30s -> 564.10s]  just like jumping. There wasn't a puzzle. You just make a box and climb. You come up here, you make
[564.10s -> 587.05s]  a box puzzle. I thought this is. Yeah, I know. Okay. Oh, we can't. Oh, hold on. Did I just like
[587.05s -> 596.33s]  push you off the level? I'm Donkey Kong here. Hold the box still so I can jump on it. Thank you.
[596.33s -> 601.69s]  Did you lose your hat? I never had a hat. What? We're the same guy. We're the same guy.
[603.83s -> 615.38s]  Conjure a box. Um, I think we should probably just all make a box and all use it together.
[616.18s -> 625.72s]  Same. Secrets. Secrets. Get the box. They didn't think he would get those secrets.
[629.10s -> 635.66s]  Oh, I don't do it. No, no, please. Let me do it. Please. Please. Okay. So the box goes. Okay.
[636.38s -> 638.78s]  Just do it. Just do it. I know you can do this. Just put it in there.
[640.81s -> 647.10s]  I figured it out. Wow. You didn't. You didn't fucking figure it out. I figured it out.
[653.54s -> 663.78s]  Oh, is it a launcher? I think it's a launcher. I think it's a weir. Is it a weir?
[668.18s -> 677.80s]  Why is that snow glowing? Why is that snow glowing? Can you break it? I can't like scrape it off
[677.80s -> 682.84s]  like an ice scraper. Um, all right. We'll see. All right. Jump on this and then yeah.
[686.46s -> 691.11s]  Do we need weight over here? As low as I can put it. All right. Ready?
[693.72s -> 702.68s]  Nice. Now I have to do this. Wow. Look at us. We are very athletic. Secrets over here.
[706.68s -> 721.29s]  Kill it. Kill it. Hey. Wow. Wow. Go forward. What if an alien just like flew their spaceship next to
[721.29s -> 728.39s]  your window and just leaned over to their friend in the cockpit and just said, kill it. Wow. Oh,
[728.39s -> 735.53s]  my God. You guys. Come on, guys. I thought you were going to like lift me up over to the ledge,
[735.53s -> 744.09s]  but I was wrong. Oh, no. What? Why? I don't know. Oh, it's a snake. Attach. Attach. Yeah.
[746.41s -> 749.21s]  I have to. Come on, rowdy.
[749.53s -> 757.75s]  Located. So wait, so I'm going to grab this thing. Yeah. You got to hook it over the woods.
[757.75s -> 764.47s]  All right. So somebody that has to stick it there. How do I hook it? She's blocking you.
[764.47s -> 768.23s]  I can't hook it. You're just going to have to run. I can't move this thing back. Hold on.
[769.27s -> 772.47s]  I got to like hook it right here, right? It's not hooking.
[774.15s -> 779.18s]  Okay. Well, I'm just going to do this. Just stay there. Okay. It's hooking.
[781.16s -> 795.03s]  Just jump over it. Wait, I got you. I got you. This is a wire rowdy.
[800.31s -> 810.15s]  The glowy snow is sticky. Nice. Well, he does that every time I have to go to my mailbox.
[815.82s -> 820.38s]  Somebody said, oh, great. Another pretending to mess up puzzle stream. We're like speed running
[820.38s -> 825.34s]  this level. We haven't even attempted to do a puzzle. Look at how fast we're going.
[825.98s -> 833.53s]  There hasn't even been an attempt. You have three wizards. We're kind of too powerful.
[833.53s -> 846.23s]  Oops. Did I get it? Got it. I did the stir thing. Wow. Jump on the box. I already beat this level
[846.23s -> 853.66s]  in my mind. Now you did. You did. There's something down there. There's two of us down here.
[854.92s -> 857.88s]  Get up here. I'm getting boxed in. Here. Take it.
[859.98s -> 870.06s]  Ooh, nice. Thank you, Taylor Swift. I'm bringing it. I'm bringing it. You bring it. We got our mail.
[870.06s -> 874.46s]  Oh, I got my mail. What's it say? Fucking evicted.
[877.10s -> 877.90s]  How far it is.
[881.90s -> 885.88s]  Oh, Disneyland. Two years ago.
[891.42s -> 897.59s]  Academy. He has vanished under mysterious and troublesome circumstances.
[903.29s -> 929.51s]  And Lord, I am going to learn magic. Constant conflict. Yeah. Turn himself into a snail.
[932.42s -> 935.30s]  A snail. He's missing, but he's actually like under that table.
[936.26s -> 938.58s]  Oh, that's actually pretty good.
[940.74s -> 941.78s]  Caught a giant quest.
[956.42s -> 959.53s]  All right. I remember this guy.
[969.34s -> 974.62s]  You get to wear his hat in TF2. I don't even know what you just said.
[977.10s -> 984.38s]  What did you say? You get to wear his hat in TF2. Wait, you actually do? Yeah. You buy,
[984.38s -> 990.14s]  try and you get his hat. Wow. That's where every single steam release had a TF2 hat tie in.
[990.78s -> 994.38s]  Whatever happened to that? You can ride pumpkins. Why are you guys pushing me?
[995.10s -> 1001.24s]  A speedrun. Wee. What? Oh, it's bouncing. No, it's not a speedrun. We have to pretend to mess up
[1001.24s -> 1018.06s]  puzzles. No, we're not. We're perfect. You died in a pumpkin accident. Oh, shit. Wait, can we all
[1018.06s -> 1025.02s]  smash? What? All I've wanted is to smash. Wait, we didn't get the thing. You didn't get the thing.
[1025.02s -> 1028.94s]  What thing? Do you really want to get the things in the tutorial? Who cares? Yeah,
[1028.94s -> 1037.96s]  can we all smash? Whoa. Stomp on that. Wait. Oh, you jump and there's a Yoshi stomp.
[1041.03s -> 1054.79s]  Do you remember this now? Yes. What? I need a block. You can't make a block. You got to smash.
[1054.79s -> 1061.72s]  Well, where's the wizard? What? I need to be launched.
[1064.31s -> 1070.94s]  Knock that. There we go. Knock that wood over here. I'm making it up now.
[1074.50s -> 1077.78s]  I need this thing to launch me. Now you have to get launched. No, not me.
[1081.19s -> 1091.88s]  No double bouncing. There you go. Okay. The secret was to do nothing. How do we get those?
[1091.88s -> 1099.98s]  Oh, that's out. All right, go. I get them. What about over here? Hey, what about over there?
[1099.98s -> 1107.38s]  No. Is there a sprint? You have to unlock it. You have to beat the game once.
[1108.42s -> 1120.02s]  No, you don't. That'd be very strange if that were true. Okay. My controller unplugged.
[1120.02s -> 1126.12s]  He's trying to create stream content. He's like already bored of the game.
[1128.55s -> 1142.79s]  Break the ceiling. Break the ceiling. Yeah. What? This game is cute. It's good. He hates streaming.
[1143.51s -> 1151.06s]  That's like my, that's like my new favorite thing. People will just write,
[1151.06s -> 1160.22s]  he hates streaming and then like a sad face. Whoa. Star, can you give us,
[1160.22s -> 1164.06s]  can you give us regular people a second to even know what the fucking thing does?
[1164.86s -> 1171.26s]  Okay. Oh, you, okay, you bounce light. That's cool. Oh, let's play. We could,
[1171.26s -> 1175.02s]  we could all bounce it. I can bounce it to you and then you can bounce it back to me and then
[1175.02s -> 1183.16s]  then we can make the, the triune. Oh, no, let's do it right now. Come on. You can get it.
[1185.00s -> 1190.15s]  What if I jumped? We have to like burn it or something. How do we burn that?
[1194.62s -> 1198.94s]  What about the green stuff? Oh, no, let's see. We know. Yeah. The green stuff behind it.
[1198.94s -> 1204.22s]  Shoot the beam at me. We got it. We got a double beam. That's no excuse for your evil doing.
[1204.30s -> 1208.89s]  It's working. All right. I'm aiming at you. Oh, look at that.
[1209.77s -> 1225.88s]  There we go. One for each of us. Nice. What are these jellies even doing? Third wheel,
[1225.88s -> 1237.51s]  trine third wheel. What? Oh, you're talking about, you're talking about me. We're getting it.
[1238.07s -> 1250.42s]  We can make a tower. Oh, my fuck. How am I supposed to drop the thing for me? Hey,
[1250.42s -> 1259.91s]  drop the thing for me. Yes. So disrespectful. Hey, we're going to get this. Projectile is
[1259.91s -> 1273.82s]  going to be blocked as well. Nice. Stop. Stop. Hey, he's trying to do this stream content.
[1273.82s -> 1282.22s]  All right. I'll go. He's already bored in the game. No, it's funny when I do it.
[1282.30s -> 1293.16s]  Yeah. That's how it always works. And I remain. Okay. I'll do this way. How did I die up here?
[1293.16s -> 1297.00s]  Killed you accidentally. I don't know. I'll do it back. All right. I'll go forward.
[1301.98s -> 1309.86s]  Okay. Didn't know. We didn't know. Oh, no. No, you were in front.
[1310.74s -> 1320.33s]  She's not. All right. I'll go forward. Wait. You have to wait. Okay. Whoever is. Wait. No, stop.
[1321.29s -> 1331.42s]  Whoever is in front. I'm going to go forward. Go. All right. Somebody get across. You did it.
[1331.42s -> 1344.42s]  All right. I'll go up. No. I can't. If I put this down, I die.
[1344.82s -> 1357.03s]  All right. We have to. No, no. You have to bounce it. No, you got it. You have to bounce it this way.
[1357.03s -> 1364.58s]  Shoot one at me. All right. I don't think you can. I can't. No, it won't reach from there.
[1365.30s -> 1376.17s]  This one's tricky. Just I'll die. Who cares? I'm good. Oh, he took it for the team. Let's go.
[1376.65s -> 1391.72s]  Hey, I'm back. Oh, no. Skeleton King. Is it a boss? Do they have bosses? Yeah. Yeah. Remember
[1391.72s -> 1403.69s]  those dragons? Do you remember this guy that we're fighting right now? I don't. Oh, yeah.
[1403.69s -> 1406.97s]  Give him a light beam. Oh, wait. I didn't need to hit his. You have to hit his like swords.
[1407.45s -> 1412.07s]  You can't stand light, sir. Wow. It's the same way you could defeat me.
[1413.43s -> 1426.38s]  All right. How do we break that? Oh, okay. That's how. He's in so much pain.
[1431.78s -> 1440.20s]  All right. I'll keep him there. You hit his back. All right. We got to break the thing up here.
[1446.86s -> 1451.34s]  I think we have to. I have to bounce. All right. We have to do like a three or four person bounce
[1451.34s -> 1465.72s]  thing here. How am I the only one that jumped on that? All right. Here we go. Oh, it'd be easier
[1465.72s -> 1474.76s]  to do that from that side because then you just shoot it up. There we go. Got to do it again.
[1476.60s -> 1499.88s]  No, you don't. All right. Kill. I have a note too. Oh, okay. So I had to, as the wizard,
[1499.88s -> 1504.52s]  destroy three trees and like a friend of goat to get my mail and he just gets it brought to him.
[1505.96s -> 1510.60s]  How long? Okay. So this is trying four. How many years have gone by since trying one?
[1512.52s -> 1517.64s]  I don't know. Use Google. We have an unfortunate case of a missing. We have a trying story.
[1521.80s -> 1529.83s]  2009. That's when the game came out. Not how long has passed in the game universe.
[1529.83s -> 1534.31s]  Oh, in the game universe. Yes, that's what I'm saying. I thought you were talking about like
[1534.31s -> 1539.51s]  when did they make that? No. Are you trying to figure out if the characters are still like
[1539.51s -> 1544.71s]  bangable or what? Yeah, it'd be really funny if they switched to the archer and she was like in
[1544.71s -> 1552.52s]  a grave. Oh, and what happened to our noble archer? Oh, oh, they got to find another guy.
[1553.00s -> 1556.60s]  Oh, no, it's the archer section.
[1567.42s -> 1568.94s]  Why did you do that? Skip.
[1574.14s -> 1577.90s]  Oh, she's the assassin's creed. Yeah. I was going to say, is that, is that a tie-in or is it just
[1577.90s -> 1588.14s]  what? It's a tie-in. Is it actually? Yeah. Yeah, the makers of this game are friends with the
[1588.14s -> 1593.58s]  assassin's creed. Are they? The prince guy that we have to stop is a templar. It's the whole thing.
[1594.30s -> 1601.50s]  Wait, what do I do? This character is kind of fun. This is your character. So this is my character.
[1601.50s -> 1604.78s]  This is your character. That's why I liked it. Okay.
[1604.78s -> 1617.42s]  Uh-huh. Bath beads? No, they're definitely bath beads. Oh yeah, you have the grapple hook too.
[1618.22s -> 1624.25s]  That's why this makes this character the hardest. So why do I have to have the hardest character?
[1624.25s -> 1628.89s]  It's not the hardest. Because you're the best. I make a box and you grapple to the box and then
[1628.89s -> 1634.49s]  I throw you into a pit. Don't you remember? Oh, now it's coming back to me. Yes, I do.
[1637.58s -> 1645.91s]  Are we capturing the objective? I don't know. Yes, you have to capture it. Somebody has to
[1645.91s -> 1660.42s]  stand there long enough to open the door. Okay. Okay. Bye. You gotta let him learn.
[1660.42s -> 1666.66s]  This is his only chance. He's never gonna. Let Rowdy do it. Wait, are you guys talking about me?
[1667.38s -> 1673.54s]  Yeah. Let Rowdy do it. Your little brother's gotta learn. I'm like four years older than you.
[1673.54s -> 1687.37s]  Oh, you got them both at a double.
[1699.11s -> 1701.43s]  All right. But seriously though, like, you know, I'm going to get these.
[1703.27s -> 1706.63s]  I'm making you do it. You do all the grunt work. We'll keep doing the level.
[1715.70s -> 1721.43s]  Somebody has to pull this. I guess I'll do it. Yeah, you do it. Enjoy your date guys. I'll
[1721.43s -> 1727.93s]  just like do all this stuff. Bye. Let's go make out. Oh, hold on. We got us Rowdy. You have to
[1727.93s -> 1739.38s]  help me. Here we go. All right. We need to look at this highlight. You can highlight targets.
[1741.21s -> 1748.30s]  Okay. So pull that. You pull it and then you attach it to this. So it stays here.
[1749.34s -> 1753.58s]  Like, so you got to pull it forward and then, then put it on the other thing. Oh,
[1753.58s -> 1762.97s]  but the camera scrolls. There we go. Yes. Oh, come on Rowdy. Oh, you can walk on it.
[1762.97s -> 1771.06s]  Oh, come on Rowdy. Well, you guys all ran away. Uh, can I, can I just do in the dessert menu?
[1777.54s -> 1783.74s]  Why is my rope growing? Yeah.
[1784.14s -> 1792.54s]  I just realized what you're doing. Please don't bully.
[1795.46s -> 1800.82s]  You guys are so bad at this game. I'm missing dinner. We're doing it so fast though.
[1800.82s -> 1806.34s]  How can you call this bad? It wasn't me. It wasn't me. It wasn't me that said that.
[1807.62s -> 1813.62s]  Oh, your chat. I'm getting, it's been long enough to make references to Spider-Man movies.
[1814.34s -> 1820.50s]  Uh, yeah. There's another room over here with a mystery box guys.
[1821.22s -> 1829.59s]  Mystery box guys. There's a mystery box over here. Whoa. Nice shot. No Rowdy.
[1835.02s -> 1839.61s]  Oh, and the, and the, he went in the tank. Oh dude, that happened to me.
[1842.81s -> 1847.77s]  I can relate to that stuffed animal. All right. So now I'm going to do, uh,
[1848.25s -> 1854.17s]  ropes of bridges too. So go, go on. Yeah. I think we're doing one at a time and then I
[1854.17s -> 1861.53s]  got to capture the flag. Oh wait, hold on a second. I can like, that's kind of cool.
[1861.53s -> 1871.02s]  Well, no, now, now I detach it. Okay. He's learning. Yeah, that's cool. Let's go.
[1878.76s -> 1888.01s]  All right. Now attach that. Attach that to that. Okay. Now I can let go of this.
[1888.09s -> 1896.63s]  Wait, no, you can't. No, you can't. It's bridge. I, yep. Okay. Oh, now you can let go of it and
[1896.63s -> 1920.01s]  climb up. You gotta be quick. Balloons. Nope. Drop down B. That's a huge cat. Yeah.
[1923.19s -> 1931.88s]  Should we ring the bell? You have to, so that the hunchback comes out.
[1932.76s -> 1943.90s]  All right. We'll open the thing. All right. We did it. I don't know how we did this. Take it.
[1948.01s -> 1970.04s]  Oh, we were, we're a mercenary thing. Oh yeah. Jerma is the bad guy. That was weird. Get it.
[1972.60s -> 1979.64s]  I get to be the first. I thought it was the other guy. I'm the one that's disturbed about them.
[1979.64s -> 1987.78s]  It was just the one without a hat. Maybe the masquerade can show you extremely hapless. Like a
[1988.58s -> 1993.54s]  new TM two player. No. All right. So then attaching this. Yeah. I think you got to wrap
[1993.54s -> 2000.50s]  it all the way around. Do I? I can't go that far. How did you get up there? I just jumped up. No.
[2001.38s -> 2013.85s]  Okay. Then. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I was already attached to it. Oh, there's one on the floor.
[2013.93s -> 2024.71s]  Yeah. It's this one here, but why can't, don't unattach, unattach. Okay. Everybody
[2024.71s -> 2032.31s]  unattach everything. Please stop. Stop. I'm not moving. I was about to ask who's rowdy.
[2041.10s -> 2046.78s]  Don't do anything. Let's start to it. Let's go. Hey, are you Brad?
[2047.26s -> 2059.66s]  It's an old meme. All right. So if you go, I don't think that's what we do. I think
[2064.50s -> 2068.42s]  unless one person, I think one person just do it and then there's a lever on the other side.
[2069.22s -> 2074.17s]  There is a lever on the other side. So I think somebody just runs it. Just go. Oh, and then you
[2074.17s -> 2083.38s]  can. Yep. I'm trying. Oh, you make the bridge. Yeah. Somebody said to make bridge. That makes
[2083.38s -> 2093.50s]  sense. Yeah, we were overthinking that. We already have 72 drops of virgin blood.
[2095.61s -> 2100.97s]  I just was going to say it was like simple syrup and red food coloring, but you fucking psycho.
[2103.26s -> 2112.81s]  While she was on her way to the masquerade, Zoya happened upon a place that brought back the town's
[2112.81s -> 2121.35s]  orphanage. 72 drops of germ of blood. What's your blood doing all over the trine world?
[2122.87s -> 2134.38s]  That person's also fucking psycho. Oh, she's sold the paintings so that she could fund the orphanage.
[2148.42s -> 2155.54s]  Bees. There's bees everywhere. Bees. That's funny for like one second when he then he stopped doing
[2155.54s -> 2162.47s]  the thing that was bees everywhere. No shadows. Clearly got stung. It was just a nightmare.
[2178.95s -> 2184.55s]  Oh, he's dead. He killed Disney. What happened?
[2194.60s -> 2200.68s]  Many letters sent by the master wizardess directed our three heroes to a rocky and
[2201.64s -> 2202.28s]  wind-beaten heath.
[2202.28s -> 2211.93s]  Whoops. He's talking to MLC's stealth. What? Beginning of level. Go.
[2214.90s -> 2222.42s]  Many letters sent by the master wizardess directed our three heroes to a rocky and wind-beaten heath.
[2222.42s -> 2228.66s]  Oh, it's for. Yeah. I thought it was. That got confused. So do we get to pick our characters
[2228.66s -> 2234.02s]  or is this just who's logged in first? At last, the enchanted heroes of trine
[2234.66s -> 2243.58s]  together again. Zoya, if you've given up your Oh, we're officially our role. We are roles.
[2246.30s -> 2250.78s]  Now we have to role play. Can you stand on my box when I hold my box?
[2251.58s -> 2254.06s]  Oh, no, they nerfed the wizard. Sorry.
[2254.86s -> 2263.10s]  No, stop. I was practicing. Now I know where I head swirl or you. You see how many head flips
[2263.10s -> 2270.30s]  you can do when you drop it. Two is it's very hard. Yeah. See me when you get 100 super jumps, buddy.
[2271.18s -> 2275.26s]  That's not that impressive. That's the end game. I don't want to rush you guys there.
[2276.22s -> 2289.02s]  Oh, nice job, Rowdy. Yeah. Thanks. You coming, Rowdy? Oh, man. Nice slam. Wow. Nice. Oh, dead.
[2289.98s -> 2303.67s]  I can get that. Everyone's doing so well right now. I know. Really? I'm really good. Really
[2303.67s -> 2307.99s]  good. I can't tell if you're trying to kill me because I think he's trying to find muted so that
[2307.99s -> 2312.95s]  he could tell people. Am I muted? I was unmuted. How long have I been muted for? Probably like an
[2312.95s -> 2320.55s]  hour. Hey, we missed blood. Everyone's freaking out. Oh, we didn't miss. Yeah, we did right here.
[2322.07s -> 2328.55s]  Well, we haven't gone yet. Oh, hold on. We need my smash. You got to break it. Yeah. Wait, wait,
[2328.55s -> 2336.20s]  this with you. This upgrade points. Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can. What the heck? Oh, my God.
[2336.20s -> 2347.02s]  There's a skill tree. Oh, there's always been skill trees. Starting skill. Next upgrade. Hey,
[2347.02s -> 2353.88s]  Ashley, I have officially replaced you. Oh, yeah. My box is as good as you are.
[2354.84s -> 2364.46s]  Okay, greater damage to enemies or a quick roll. Oh, now I'm more annoying.
[2367.02s -> 2377.22s]  How do I do it? There it is. That's my new ability. It's Sonic the Hedgehog over here.
[2377.22s -> 2383.35s]  Actually, you go pretty far too. You guys need that? Do you guys need a bridge? Let me know when
[2383.35s -> 2389.19s]  you need a bridge. I'll be useful. Rowdy touched it. Despite not needing it, Rowdy really made
[2389.19s -> 2394.63s]  her to drop it on you. What? I didn't do anything. When someone touches it, it falls.
[2397.06s -> 2404.06s]  But what are you going to do? I'm going to do the same thing. Excellent work, everybody. We need a
[2404.06s -> 2417.08s]  box. But hold on a minute here. Secret, secret. Yeah. Can you lift that box up a little? You can't
[2417.08s -> 2423.56s]  if you're on it. Oh, wait. Yeah. Oh, the whole teamwork, dude. Wow, look at this. Look at this.
[2423.56s -> 2437.37s]  It's a super. Oh, my God. That's a super. Shoot it. Oh, super. Wow. This game's got fun.
[2443.48s -> 2448.84s]  Oh, I think you might have to get it to touch this. This thing down here. Do we have to swap
[2448.84s -> 2455.80s]  characters? No, there's no swapping allowed. We get no swapping allowed, no matter what. I thought
[2456.44s -> 2461.40s]  I mean, it is allowed, but both packed. OK. No swapping allowed. Well, what do you want to do
[2461.40s -> 2477.29s]  here then? I don't know. I don't know. You should be able to do everything with only one person.
[2477.29s -> 2484.90s]  OK. Oh, no. What about this big lever up here? Yeah. No, there has to be something with this
[2487.14s -> 2496.39s]  mechanism up here. Yeah. No, maybe that drops the mechanism. Maybe when you actually shine
[2496.39s -> 2507.14s]  the light in there. Oh, I might. Yeah. All right. What are you? What? Wait, wait. Hold on. What if
[2507.14s -> 2511.99s]  you stand on the box like put the box here? Can you like stand and bounce it?
[2518.18s -> 2537.06s]  There you go. Like, can you do it from there? No. Hmm. Hmm. That's not how light works.
[2537.14s -> 2538.34s]  We got like a physicist.
[2542.66s -> 2548.66s]  What if you jumped down and aimed like as you fell? No, that's still.
[2550.10s -> 2558.62s]  Whoa, wait a minute. What if you did this? Hmm. What? Hmm. Stand on my thing. It's not
[2559.26s -> 2568.14s]  that I can't. I can't reflect it backwards. What if I do it the other way? Can I attach
[2568.14s -> 2575.66s]  another way? Wait a minute. Hmm. Oh, hold on. Let me let me let me move you down a little.
[2579.45s -> 2586.47s]  Hmm. If you were standing right above it, wouldn't you get it? Maybe. Right there. Right
[2586.47s -> 2602.18s]  right around there somewhere. There's an angle. Oh, hold on. I don't think there is. Remove box.
[2602.98s -> 2616.82s]  Get rid of the box. Right. Now do it. No, still wants to go that that way. Damn it. Hold on. What
[2616.82s -> 2622.74s]  if I go here? Does it reflect off of the metal above you? Oh, it's so close. Hold on. Let me let
[2622.74s -> 2635.16s]  me. Can you like skate on it from here? What? Look at that. Come on. That should count, game.
[2635.16s -> 2646.82s]  Oh, it briefly is counting. I see it like lighting up. It's so close. Oh, and we can't stand up there.
[2647.70s -> 2655.11s]  Oh, damn it. That's some shit. We did it. How are you supposed to do that? Nice work.
[2658.09s -> 2667.90s]  Uh, I need to like. Oh, sorry. I guess I just ride this.
[2672.50s -> 2675.78s]  Come on, Rowdy. Um, I have to do it. I can only get there by riding this.
[2676.90s -> 2684.09s]  Come on, Rowdy. Oh, wait. It's okay. It's a bridge. Whoopsie. We both jumped over.
[2684.09s -> 2690.31s]  Right. It's a bridge. Okay. You're right. Sorry about that. Sorry. I thought I don't know why I
[2690.31s -> 2701.61s]  thought that was in the same plane. Wait, what's up here? Secret? Potentially? No. I already went
[2701.61s -> 2714.92s]  over there. Oh, we have another light thing to do. Maybe this one will be not as ridiculous as the
[2714.92s -> 2724.20s]  last one. Where? Where am I trying to? Up here. Up straight up. Oh, is this wall a thing here?
[2726.66s -> 2734.02s]  Thing? I don't know. I feel like we're missing something that can reflect the light in something
[2734.02s -> 2751.61s]  else. Well, I can't. I mean, I can do this. I guess I can attach to your box and I don't know
[2751.61s -> 2764.70s]  if that helps at all. This again? No. No, it's blocking away. My forehead can reflect. Oh,
[2764.70s -> 2775.90s]  get the fuck out of here. You motherfucker. I did. I did pick the mode where we can have multiples of
[2775.90s -> 2780.70s]  each character, but I don't think that should matter because this is this is so easy. Just
[2780.70s -> 2786.38s]  wait doesn't change. Yeah. As far as I was aware, and I don't know if I could change to this point
[2787.90s -> 2793.66s]  because I mean, yeah, I could just also do that instantly. But I don't want to do that.
[2793.66s -> 2802.07s]  There's a no switch mode. So there is a no switching characters mode. Yeah. Oh,
[2803.11s -> 2807.27s]  but I don't think the game changes depending on whether or not you've selected that mode
[2809.11s -> 2814.31s]  the game changes. I'm saying I don't think that it does. Well, that's somebody didn't just said
[2814.31s -> 2820.04s]  like I just watched somebody do this and the game does change. Really? Yeah. Apparently the game
[2820.04s -> 2825.00s]  changes. There's less objects. Okay. How about if we go to main menu and I re-invite everybody and
[2825.00s -> 2835.91s]  we see? Yeah, let's do that. Wait, they're lying. Are they lying? We're confirming. Are they lying?
[2836.71s -> 2842.60s]  It's okay. I made it. We could switch all solely because I forgot in the beginning. You all get
[2842.60s -> 2846.76s]  to be the guys and I all want it to slam. That's just like the old. That's all I want. That's like
[2846.76s -> 2852.12s]  like the old school. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's the one thing I wanted. Okay. So let me know when
[2852.12s -> 2868.89s]  you're ready. I invited you guys. Okay. Okay. There it is. You're gonna trust his chat way too
[2868.89s -> 2874.89s]  much. No, no, I'm telling somebody. People have like proof apparently. This better not start from
[2874.89s -> 2884.02s]  beginning. I'm gonna fucking scream. Apparently this video proof. Yeah. Oh my god. It's the whole
[2884.02s -> 2892.68s]  thing. What? No. No, it's not. Attending a wizarding conference with his fellow wizards.
[2894.44s -> 2903.26s]  Hold on. Hold on. I'm seeing if I can. It's not letting me change levels. It's like we never even
[2903.26s -> 2908.46s]  did the other ones because it's because it's a different game time to find that mailbox or
[2908.46s -> 2920.23s]  different mode. Yeah. I knew this was gonna fucking happen. Speedrun. Speedrun. Anyone who just joined.
[2920.23s -> 2935.99s]  You didn't miss anything. Fast. Go. Oh no. But but but we have to do them all. We have to do all of
[2935.99s -> 2945.05s]  them. We'll skip the cutscenes. It'll be really fast. Okay. Very fast. Very fast. You could just
[2945.05s -> 2949.29s]  talk to your chat about like life and stuff. You were driving down the road the other day and you
[2949.29s -> 2957.13s]  had the coffee. No, no, no. I've had too many coffees. There's no more. What? In the world?
[2957.13s -> 2963.11s]  There's no more. I drank them all so I can't do those stories anymore. Uppy. Uppy. I don't understand.
[2963.11s -> 2970.84s]  The world has made more coffee since then. You would think. Are you swearing off coffee or do you have like
[2970.84s -> 2975.96s]  a heart condition now? I didn't actually. I still can drink coffee. It's the one thing I still am
[2975.96s -> 2986.63s]  allowed to do. You just. Nothing else. Nothing else. Sticky snow. All four boxes are the same color now.
[2994.84s -> 2997.64s]  That was a very genuine. My god.
[2998.12s -> 3000.12s]  Oh my god. Oh my god.
[3022.06s -> 3024.06s]  I'm just trying to get up there like fast. You know what I mean?
[3025.02s -> 3029.34s]  I'm going to solo this level. Oh, we got to recollect all the things.
[3029.90s -> 3041.26s]  It's only right. Got it. Just die. Just die. Die. Die. Just die. How do I die? I don't know. You
[3041.26s -> 3047.13s]  just get over here, right? You can just like teleport to me. I don't know how. Wait, we need
[3047.13s -> 3053.93s]  these. My trustworthy box magic. All you have to do is reach the mailbox and then it'll end. Just
[3053.93s -> 3068.82s]  reach the mailbox star. I'm doing it. I gotta go get my mail. Oh, poor girl. I can't believe
[3068.82s -> 3075.53s]  we would do this again. Well, now we. Here, you guys collect the things. I'm going forward.
[3078.90s -> 3086.73s]  I need another box. I really should have sent this postcard earlier to market. Why isn't this
[3086.73s -> 3089.77s]  nearest mailbox located any closer to civilization?
[3096.65s -> 3101.69s]  Oh, this is the tryhard sounds of keyboard clicking and sounds.
[3104.09s -> 3112.20s]  I need wait. Waiting for other players to continue. I need you guys to activate the
[3112.20s -> 3123.05s]  goat cut scene. What? What? No. I'm like stuck in this one thing. Fuck. No. Hold on. I'll get you.
[3123.05s -> 3129.70s]  I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. We should like disconnect. Oh, no. I got it. I
[3129.70s -> 3134.26s]  glitched out and I got it. All right. Good. Because we need each other over here. All right.
[3134.26s -> 3146.18s]  Run. The speed run is taking longer than the actual run. Yes. I mean, it kind of sort of.
[3147.14s -> 3153.03s]  Okay. Now you stick that one on the sticky one over here. There's a sticky one here.
[3154.07s -> 3161.02s]  Yeah. $500 bounty on anyone who can figure out goat skip. Right there. The snow is sticky. Now
[3161.02s -> 3171.18s]  we need to weigh it down. So weigh this end down. Like this? Yeah. Like over here so we
[3171.18s -> 3180.04s]  could jump to it. Started. Did this one last time. How are you guys still back there?
[3180.04s -> 3187.59s]  Yeah. We need to know here. Go. Well, you're going to be stuck here. You're going to weigh
[3187.59s -> 3196.14s]  yourself down. Just jump off the map. There is no pit here. Jump off the map. Are you not even to
[3196.14s -> 3200.70s]  the fucking the bridge thing yet? There you go. All right. No, no, just stay. He's going to make
[3200.70s -> 3205.42s]  it from here. I'm not a wizard. I'm a warrior. You're time to open up the drama stream to see
[3205.42s -> 3211.10s]  where you're at so I can give my helpful tips and tricks for trying for. Wait, what happened?
[3211.90s -> 3217.74s]  Okay. There you go. Now. There you go. Yeah. You got it. Yeah. Shut up. Shut up. I don't want to
[3217.74s -> 3227.51s]  hear it. I can ban you all and I will. All right. Let's go. We're almost there. We've almost made
[3227.51s -> 3237.26s]  it. Yes. Oh yeah. Right. We just die. Yes. Death warp. That's how you do it. Okay. Now we need a
[3237.26s -> 3258.09s]  goat. How do you activate the goat? Dude, this is taking longer than the last one. Why don't you
[3258.09s -> 3263.13s]  guys just stay near a pit so that when I get forward, you can. Yeah. But some of the stuff
[3263.13s -> 3266.89s]  you have to have to more than one person do. No, you don't. No, you don't. No, you don't.
[3270.04s -> 3277.72s]  It's trying. You don't. Everything in trying can be done with one person. Oh yeah. If you can
[3277.72s -> 3288.95s]  character switch. What about the game mode we just played? Get those. Well, Jerma, we've already done
[3288.95s -> 3308.38s]  this level. We got the letter. Oh, wait. We need. All right. Here we go. Where are you? Come on.
[3308.94s -> 3315.48s]  It's spawning me back from the pit. Oh, it's spawning you back at the pit. Oh shit. Well,
[3315.48s -> 3328.36s]  I have a levitating device here. All right. Now I'm going to do this. Come on. Get it. Get it.
[3328.92s -> 3334.20s]  Oh, no, you got it right there. I figured I figured out how to do one person light reflect.
[3334.20s -> 3337.56s]  You picked the wrong skill. There's a dream shield where you can leave an
[3337.56s -> 3341.72s]  ethereal copy of your shield in place. And so you pick the wrong skill.
[3343.16s -> 3347.80s]  And I think it was a bonus. I think it was a bonus objective because we could continue without it.
[3347.80s -> 3352.68s]  Can we just confirm? I mean, you already got the joke across everybody in chat. Is this real?
[3352.68s -> 3357.13s]  Well, was this just like a like is this did they actually have less objects
[3357.77s -> 3362.17s]  in this motion? You already got us. So might as well just come clean here.
[3363.61s -> 3366.97s]  What? I'm just asking if this game both things actually real.
[3367.85s -> 3377.69s]  What? It's not. It's not. What's going on? I'm not doing this. You're doing it.
[3377.69s -> 3384.70s]  I'm not doing this right now. I don't know how to start a game that's not at level one.
[3385.50s -> 3392.68s]  A shame about the endless kill us back in the day with tended feels.
[3392.68s -> 3396.52s]  What the fuck is going on? Are you stuck?
[3396.52s -> 3399.00s]  I just my character just like lagged out. I'm dying.
[3399.56s -> 3403.24s]  Well, no, I'm actually somewhere where you can die and I'll be done.
[3403.24s -> 3410.82s]  I'll I'll be done to say, OK, I should teleport to you know, it's a haunted old man.
[3410.82s -> 3420.57s]  What? I don't know how you do this doesn't make any sense.
[3421.37s -> 3429.48s]  Switch it to the PS1 quick. Yeah, it could work.
[3430.12s -> 3436.79s]  Do you guys have this on PS4? We could switch. Of course, I bought a copy in every system.
[3437.82s -> 3443.00s]  Same. That's how much preparation I put in for the stream.
[3443.00s -> 3444.84s]  Now, can I get some people dances in the chat, please?
[3446.07s -> 3459.96s]  You put better.
[3466.57s -> 3469.37s]  Can we all agree actually that it was Ashley's fault?
[3469.37s -> 3471.77s]  Why? Because she picked the wrong skill.
[3472.57s -> 3474.65s]  Well, how did you pick those corrected?
[3474.65s -> 3477.53s]  How a good night to turn. I picked the first thing that
[3477.53s -> 3481.45s]  looks like it wasn't locked on my screen. How are you supposed to know that?
[3486.58s -> 3490.12s]  It's her fault. It's really her fault.
[3490.28s -> 3497.72s]  I feel like all right because we get to experience like the big like
[3497.72s -> 3501.72s]  hog moment of when we get the huge one again. You know what I mean? Remember that?
[3517.64s -> 3519.16s]  Oh, yeah, I remember this moment.
[3520.12s -> 3523.40s]  OK, I'm forward. One, two, three.
[3523.40s -> 3527.32s]  Why did you say go? Because it's a speed run.
[3528.28s -> 3533.14s]  Well, I'm backward. One, two, three.
[3536.30s -> 3537.82s]  Got it. No, I didn't. I went too high.
[3540.12s -> 3544.76s]  All right. I'm blocking the I'm just standing here. You just shoot it.
[3546.46s -> 3552.79s]  OK, let's go. Yeah, let's go.
[3555.11s -> 3555.59s]  Let's go.
[3563.02s -> 3566.14s]  Again, make sure he bounces it towards you.
[3566.14s -> 3572.54s]  You get it then go watch this.
[3572.54s -> 3576.34s]  Got it immediately. Oh, we're so good.
[3579.85s -> 3582.90s]  Oh, world's first. World's first.
[3582.90s -> 3586.42s]  Is that like six seconds? Skip, skip.
[3590.30s -> 3591.82s]  I almost just exited to the main menu.
[3595.70s -> 3598.02s]  It's going to be really funny when we do this for every stage,
[3598.02s -> 3601.22s]  even the ones we haven't seen yet, because we actually practice this on stream.
[3601.22s -> 3602.26s]  I'm talking to myself.
[3603.30s -> 3607.30s]  You know, actually, I was thinking you can tell me what the scale of comedy this would be.
[3608.50s -> 3613.22s]  I was thinking of like a long time ago, you know, like Dark Souls one speed runs.
[3614.18s -> 3619.51s]  Yeah, I was thinking, what if I just opened up Dark Souls was like, you know what, guys,
[3619.51s -> 3623.51s]  I'm going to like play Dark Souls. This is before I even played Dark Souls one like on stream, right?
[3624.23s -> 3631.99s]  What if I practiced the first like 12 minutes of like the Dark Souls one speed run
[3631.99s -> 3635.19s]  and got it perfect and just turned it on, just started fucking going.
[3637.21s -> 3640.65s]  I kind of did that with Dark Messiah where I didn't say I was going to speed run it,
[3640.65s -> 3642.33s]  and I just knew all the speed run tricks.
[3643.05s -> 3646.89s]  Yeah, but I'm talking like actual, like you learn the actual route.
[3647.13s -> 3648.01s]  Like you hate them.
[3649.93s -> 3654.60s]  Oh no, he hates us. Sad.
[3655.32s -> 3660.12s]  Wait, wait, so I gave an example of me doing it and your counterpoint was no, but actually.
[3660.12s -> 3664.84s]  No, no, there's a difference. No, there's a difference between I just play this game a
[3664.84s -> 3670.44s]  lot and know some of the routes to I'm doing the actual like any percent route on Dark Souls one.
[3672.71s -> 3675.11s]  There's a difference between I know this game pretty well.
[3675.67s -> 3679.11s]  No, no, I knew the speed run route. I did the speed run route.
[3681.24s -> 3682.60s]  Was it the first time you ever played it?
[3687.10s -> 3689.82s]  This is your joke and you're not giving me credit for it.
[3690.62s -> 3693.19s]  He didn't do that. Did he do that guys?
[3697.37s -> 3699.29s]  No lonely, sad man.
[3699.93s -> 3702.44s]  He didn't do it. All right, hold it back.
[3702.44s -> 3703.88s]  No, he didn't. I'm seeing a lot of nos.
[3704.68s -> 3711.13s]  Dark Messiah. Dark Messiah doesn't have routes is what people are saying.
[3712.57s -> 3713.69s]  They're calling you out.
[3719.83s -> 3721.43s]  You're not going to get the germ of blood.
[3722.84s -> 3724.04s]  Those balloons have things in them.
[3726.15s -> 3728.55s]  Now you agree it's germ of blood. Oh no, we fucked it up.
[3734.58s -> 3738.42s]  No, we had it. You had to get the blood.
[3738.42s -> 3741.22s]  But I was yelled at. Everyone was like, dude, blood.
[3741.94s -> 3744.74s]  I get yelled at all the time living with this guy.
[3746.20s -> 3749.56s]  Eventually, you just learn to live with it.
[3749.56s -> 3752.97s]  Now I'm going to pull this. Okay, now you pull it.
[3753.69s -> 3756.33s]  Now you make sure I can get across. Next I got it.
[3760.06s -> 3767.61s]  He's actually not getting these in the route. You get those because you need to have at least
[3767.61s -> 3773.72s]  15 to get the one skill. Yeah, he thinks he knows the routes.
[3774.44s -> 3782.42s]  This is actually like, I really like them. I need these.
[3782.42s -> 3783.46s]  All right, whatever. Who cares?
[3784.10s -> 3795.91s]  He's made the decision for us apparently. Hey, Steve, we hate you.
[3796.95s -> 3804.78s]  Yeah, I know. Why can't you be more likeable?
[3804.78s -> 3807.18s]  Hey, what have I happened to? I can do this all by myself.
[3807.18s -> 3808.54s]  Everything can be done. I got here.
[3808.54s -> 3812.70s]  I was doing everything by myself and I was trying to figure out how to do that one.
[3813.74s -> 3815.18s]  I'm sure there's a way. Actually,
[3815.18s -> 3817.74s]  probably if you connected the rope on both of them, you could probably do it.
[3821.43s -> 3824.79s]  If I told you to open Dark Messiah up right now and do the first 20 minutes in a route,
[3824.79s -> 3825.43s]  would you be able to do it?
[3834.42s -> 3836.98s]  Yeah, I think I could. I think I could do it.
[3841.62s -> 3843.14s]  Unfortunately, we don't have time for that.
[3843.78s -> 3848.34s]  And Jerma, you think it's like, oh, you just you didn't even the beginning of Dark Messiah.
[3848.34s -> 3853.78s]  One of the skips requires you to break cut scene, break, go out of like,
[3853.78s -> 3856.58s]  like the whole cut scenes happening and you're walking around outside of it.
[3856.58s -> 3859.62s]  Then edge clip on the edge of the map, but pause the screen.
[3859.62s -> 3862.42s]  And while the game is paused, you pause for an exact amount of time.
[3862.42s -> 3866.98s]  And then it launches you forward over a castle wall, specifically into one exact window.
[3866.98s -> 3869.86s]  And I did that without mentioning that I knew any of this.
[3869.86s -> 3872.66s]  And this is your joke. And I know this for it.
[3873.54s -> 3875.78s]  Why did why did you do that? Why did you why did you play it on stream?
[3875.78s -> 3879.14s]  Then just trying to prove how much better you are than everybody else.
[3879.14s -> 3881.38s]  I thought I loved that game and I thought it was funny.
[3882.50s -> 3883.94s]  It's your joke. You get it.
[3884.82s -> 3885.94s]  You get why I did it.
[3903.77s -> 3906.25s]  Oh, no, no, I'm the wizard. Why am I the wizard?
[3909.61s -> 3910.01s]  Players.
[3912.41s -> 3914.89s]  Rowdy wants to switch with Ashley. What?
[3914.89s -> 3916.89s]  What? No, no, you don't.
[3916.89s -> 3917.45s]  How did I do that?
[3917.45s -> 3918.89s]  You want to switch with me? How do we?
[3918.89s -> 3921.29s]  I just pressed like our I just pressed red.
[3921.29s -> 3924.01s]  Okay, I press red, red, red bumper.
[3924.01s -> 3924.97s]  Red Rover.
[3924.97s -> 3928.81s]  I was about to say red, red bumper.
[3928.81s -> 3930.49s]  What? Right bumper.
[3931.45s -> 3932.57s]  You got monkeys on the brain.
[3935.66s -> 3938.54s]  Okay, remember, remember to pick the right skill this time, Ashley.
[3940.07s -> 3940.79s]  Red rum.
[3942.47s -> 3944.39s]  Oh, murder on the brain. Oh, shit.
[3945.19s -> 3948.17s]  Hold on. All right.
[3948.17s -> 3949.37s]  We're actually playing the game now.
[3949.37s -> 3951.21s]  This is no longer the tutorial. We want to get the stuff.
[3953.51s -> 3957.13s]  I think you need to do the super launch, right?
[3957.77s -> 3959.29s]  The butt launch on here on the other side.
[3959.29s -> 3961.45s]  Do the butt launch. Do the butt launch.
[3961.45s -> 3962.41s]  Nice. There you go.
[3963.21s -> 3968.98s]  Oh, wait, I need those.
[3969.62s -> 3971.46s]  We got to go down. There's a lot of things down.
[3972.26s -> 3973.14s]  Oh, yeah, there is.
[3975.82s -> 3977.18s]  And you got a rope over here.
[3978.06s -> 3978.86s]  Uh huh.
[3978.86s -> 3980.94s]  Yeah, this is what I'm freaking talking about right now.
[3981.18s -> 3982.38s]  All right, now we have a level up.
[3983.18s -> 3984.06s]  We got a treasure.
[3986.70s -> 3987.74s]  Yeah, I got that before.
[3989.02s -> 3990.30s]  None of you were optimized.
[3990.30s -> 3994.30s]  I'm so far ahead of you doing the speed run, doing the joke, not getting credit.
[3994.30s -> 3998.46s]  I was thinking about this new series on YouTube telling me if this is interesting or not.
[3998.46s -> 4002.14s]  Where I watch a movie or a TV show that it's weird.
[4003.10s -> 4006.46s]  And I make a video that breaks it all down and shit.
[4006.46s -> 4007.02s]  But Pog!
[4007.98s -> 4008.86s]  Pog moment, hold on.
[4009.82s -> 4010.22s]  Shoot it.
[4013.26s -> 4014.22s]  Don't want to break it.
[4014.22s -> 4014.62s]  I got it.
[4015.64s -> 4017.08s]  I mean, you're going to call the series.
[4017.08s -> 4018.12s]  What are you doing?
[4018.12s -> 4021.08s]  No series is going to call like, dude, what is this box?
[4021.08s -> 4021.80s]  Where was this?
[4021.80s -> 4023.32s]  This is called. This is a different game mode.
[4023.32s -> 4025.00s]  We didn't know. We did not get you baited by Chad.
[4025.00s -> 4025.40s]  It was real.
[4027.91s -> 4028.71s]  Okay.
[4028.71s -> 4031.59s]  Okay. Well, go down, go down here, go to the bottom.
[4031.59s -> 4032.47s]  All right, we can do that.
[4032.47s -> 4032.95s]  That works.
[4035.03s -> 4036.31s]  I can't believe we cheesed it.
[4037.27s -> 4040.63s]  It was up here the whole time where I was poking around before.
[4040.63s -> 4041.03s]  Okay.
[4041.03s -> 4042.95s]  What's so urgent about getting this boy back?
[4042.95s -> 4045.35s]  Wait, maybe they want stuff.
[4045.35s -> 4045.51s]  Yeah.
[4050.20s -> 4050.68s]  I'm mad.
[4051.64s -> 4053.32s]  Hey, you picked the game mode.
[4053.32s -> 4053.80s]  I did.
[4053.80s -> 4056.52s]  And it's my fault because I really just wanted us to all pound the ground.
[4056.52s -> 4057.80s]  And we briefly did anyway.
[4058.68s -> 4059.80s]  It was really important.
[4059.80s -> 4061.16s]  Look how many of these they give us.
[4061.80s -> 4063.32s]  Yeah, this is a different game.
[4066.25s -> 4068.33s]  You can get off of it, Rowdy.
[4069.69s -> 4070.89s]  I don't even need both of those.
[4072.44s -> 4073.40s]  I don't even need them.
[4073.40s -> 4074.20s]  That's offensive.
[4074.92s -> 4075.64s]  I don't even need them.
[4076.44s -> 4078.58s]  Oh, yeah.
[4078.58s -> 4078.82s]  Yeah.
[4079.70s -> 4080.34s]  That's why.
[4080.34s -> 4080.74s]  Okay.
[4080.74s -> 4083.30s]  Level up, but maybe don't level up.
[4084.18s -> 4085.27s]  All right.
[4085.27s -> 4085.83s]  Hit tab.
[4086.95s -> 4088.39s]  I guess you don't get those till later.
[4088.95s -> 4089.11s]  Yeah.
[4089.11s -> 4090.71s]  You couldn't actually get dream shield.
[4091.99s -> 4092.63s]  Oh, yeah.
[4092.63s -> 4095.43s]  I took the other skill because it was the only one that I could take.
[4095.43s -> 4096.95s]  Thanks for blaming me for nothing.
[4096.95s -> 4099.03s]  I can't believe Ashley would fuck this whole thing up.
[4100.23s -> 4103.40s]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[4103.40s -> 4105.48s]  Buying the lightning sword again.
[4107.78s -> 4108.90s]  Found a new letter.
[4109.86s -> 4112.42s]  I hope you have found the missing prints by now.
[4112.42s -> 4113.06s]  You can read them.
[4113.06s -> 4113.54s]  I don't want them.
[4113.54s -> 4115.30s]  If not, please be warned.
[4115.30s -> 4123.45s]  Oh, reading the story in Trine.
[4124.25s -> 4126.25s]  I mean, like, really?
[4127.61s -> 4129.61s]  Reading the lore snippets in Trine.
[4137.93s -> 4139.13s]  What a big bird.
[4140.09s -> 4141.93s]  But wait, hold on.
[4143.21s -> 4144.73s]  Yeah, because then I need to go down here
[4144.73s -> 4146.41s]  and get these little gumdrops.
[4148.41s -> 4151.61s]  No, Star, you cannot recreate the video.
[4151.61s -> 4152.17s]  I'm sorry.
[4152.17s -> 4154.17s]  I know it was a funny video,
[4154.17s -> 4156.41s]  but we can't just try to recreate it.
[4157.54s -> 4158.82s]  That season already exists on TV.
[4158.82s -> 4160.26s]  I should have dropped the whole thing.
[4160.26s -> 4162.82s]  That was the real video inside us the whole time.
[4163.70s -> 4164.42s]  Inside of you?
[4164.98s -> 4165.22s]  Yeah.
[4167.22s -> 4171.06s]  Pepehands, old German, old Star.
[4172.79s -> 4174.79s]  The video was like 2014.
[4175.43s -> 4176.31s]  That's what everyone says.
[4176.31s -> 4177.35s]  I missed the old star.
[4179.19s -> 4180.71s]  Okay, I can attach to this.
[4180.71s -> 4183.88s]  So what does it want us to do?
[4183.88s -> 4184.60s]  Stick it up there.
[4185.64s -> 4186.14s]  Stop.
[4186.92s -> 4187.32s]  Stop.
[4187.32s -> 4188.20s]  Just for a second.
[4188.20s -> 4188.76s]  Stop.
[4188.76s -> 4189.80s]  Like we had it.
[4189.80s -> 4190.84s]  I missed the old star.
[4192.44s -> 4193.48s]  I'm trying to recreate it.
[4195.67s -> 4196.31s]  All right, I get it.
[4198.25s -> 4198.97s]  What about you?
[4198.97s -> 4199.53s]  What about me?
[4199.53s -> 4200.57s]  Are you confident with your hook?
[4204.94s -> 4206.78s]  So I got one attached and now bring me up.
[4208.70s -> 4210.46s]  When you are attached to it, I can't lift it.
[4214.44s -> 4215.64s]  What am I supposed to do?
[4215.64s -> 4218.28s]  Just stand on the left and jump across, but don't attach.
[4219.32s -> 4220.28s]  It was the explosions.
[4220.28s -> 4222.20s]  It was like it was the stomping that freaked me out.
[4222.20s -> 4223.40s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4223.40s -> 4224.68s]  I'm giving you motivation.
[4224.68s -> 4225.16s]  What is this?
[4225.88s -> 4226.36s]  Monsters.
[4227.64s -> 4230.60s]  You actually have to fight in this game.
[4231.40s -> 4234.63s]  These are the things that stole the prince.
[4234.63s -> 4261.64s]  This is like a little secret area, I guess.
[4262.92s -> 4265.78s]  I guess, man.
[4265.78s -> 4266.74s]  Oh, I see.
[4273.72s -> 4275.32s]  Wow, that's that's one tap.
[4275.88s -> 4277.40s]  Okay.
[4280.36s -> 4281.96s]  Why don't you just bring it over here?
[4286.14s -> 4287.18s]  Maybe you go to the bottom.
[4289.74s -> 4290.62s]  Then you can do it more.
[4291.58s -> 4293.50s]  Can you make a rope for me to stand on, Jeremy?
[4293.50s -> 4293.90s]  I can.
[4298.78s -> 4299.82s]  Maybe I can give you the box.
[4300.54s -> 4302.12s]  I mean, you can stand on that.
[4302.84s -> 4304.62s]  It's gonna work.
[4310.73s -> 4311.37s]  All right.
[4311.37s -> 4312.25s]  There we go.
[4312.25s -> 4313.45s]  See, all three of us.
[4314.33s -> 4315.85s]  That's a true Trier moment.
[4316.49s -> 4317.29s]  Another big one.
[4318.33s -> 4320.89s]  There's a word, there's a word I'm gonna say.
[4320.89s -> 4322.65s]  I can't, I don't know what it is.
[4325.69s -> 4326.41s]  The chat's already doing it.
[4326.41s -> 4326.81s]  It's fine.
[4326.81s -> 4327.45s]  That's what it was.
[4328.25s -> 4329.94s]  What was the word?
[4329.94s -> 4330.74s]  I'm not in that chat.
[4331.46s -> 4332.66s]  Say the word out loud.
[4332.66s -> 4333.30s]  Loud and proud.
[4333.30s -> 4335.54s]  I don't know if I can right now.
[4335.54s -> 4336.18s]  Nothing happened.
[4339.50s -> 4340.14s]  Oh, my God.
[4342.18s -> 4354.60s]  Here, more of these under here.
[4357.88s -> 4359.11s]  Cool.
[4359.11s -> 4359.99s]  You gotta get the blood.
[4361.43s -> 4361.99s]  Yeah, I did.
[4362.63s -> 4363.75s]  Get off, get off.
[4364.71s -> 4369.64s]  You really are the like little brother, aren't you?
[4369.64s -> 4370.28s]  Get off.
[4370.28s -> 4370.92s]  Get up here.
[4370.92s -> 4371.80s]  Ashley, up top.
[4371.80s -> 4372.44s]  I'm getting off.
[4372.44s -> 4372.92s]  Get off of it.
[4372.92s -> 4373.32s]  It's mine.
[4373.32s -> 4373.64s]  Get off.
[4373.64s -> 4374.28s]  Get off of it.
[4375.24s -> 4375.80s]  Get off of that.
[4377.13s -> 4377.45s]  Okay.
[4386.17s -> 4387.61s]  Yeah, I didn't like that one.
[4387.61s -> 4388.81s]  I don't like that one either.
[4388.81s -> 4390.49s]  Somebody said, wow, you all suck.
[4390.49s -> 4391.77s]  This place is a freak show.
[4392.33s -> 4394.01s]  You fucking guys are so bad at this game.
[4394.01s -> 4394.73s]  Like, I'm missing dinner now.
[4394.73s -> 4395.53s]  What are you referring to your chat?
[4396.49s -> 4396.97s]  I don't know.
[4397.53s -> 4398.09s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[4398.09s -> 4398.89s]  Who are you talking about?
[4399.69s -> 4400.65s]  The freak show.
[4400.65s -> 4402.57s]  Otherwise known as German's chat.
[4402.57s -> 4406.25s]  Yeah, the insight, the what an inhumane psychopath.
[4407.61s -> 4409.00s]  You guys need this ball.
[4414.06s -> 4414.46s]  True.
[4414.46s -> 4415.42s]  I'm going to be true.
[4417.14s -> 4417.70s]  What?
[4417.70s -> 4417.94s]  All right.
[4417.94s -> 4419.62s]  Now, if you do the super blast,
[4420.50s -> 4421.54s]  you can launch the ball up.
[4421.54s -> 4422.58s]  Here we go.
[4422.58s -> 4423.54s]  There it is.
[4423.54s -> 4424.18s]  Do it again.
[4427.83s -> 4427.99s]  No.
[4429.43s -> 4430.55s]  Oh, nice one.
[4431.19s -> 4432.31s]  Do we even need that thing for now?
[4433.98s -> 4434.46s]  Nope.
[4434.46s -> 4435.75s]  Now we don't.
[4435.75s -> 4436.23s]  All right.
[4436.23s -> 4437.67s]  I'm going to attach this to this.
[4438.63s -> 4440.47s]  I don't know.
[4440.47s -> 4440.87s]  Maybe not.
[4442.54s -> 4443.66s]  Oh, it's just I see.
[4446.89s -> 4448.09s]  Oh, I got to jam this.
[4450.20s -> 4451.72s]  Can you get off that block?
[4452.68s -> 4452.92s]  Okay.
[4452.92s -> 4453.24s]  You got.
[4453.24s -> 4453.48s]  Okay.
[4453.48s -> 4454.04s]  You know, you got.
[4454.04s -> 4454.76s]  I was holding still.
[4454.76s -> 4455.00s]  Okay.
[4455.00s -> 4455.64s]  I wasn't.
[4455.64s -> 4455.80s]  Yeah.
[4455.80s -> 4456.12s]  Okay.
[4456.84s -> 4457.16s]  Okay.
[4458.36s -> 4459.96s]  I fucking love this guy.
[4459.96s -> 4461.24s]  German985.
[4461.24s -> 4461.64s]  They call him.
[4463.64s -> 4464.76s]  Steve, please.
[4464.76s -> 4464.92s]  What?
[4466.92s -> 4468.28s]  If I was running away from school,
[4468.28s -> 4471.56s]  I'd go somewhere with more entertainment prospects.
[4471.56s -> 4472.20s]  Wait, what does that do?
[4473.32s -> 4474.28s]  Does that like activate a button?
[4474.92s -> 4475.56s]  Did you press that?
[4476.44s -> 4476.76s]  No, I didn't.
[4476.76s -> 4477.00s]  What?
[4478.42s -> 4479.78s]  I think we can pull the thing down.
[4480.58s -> 4484.02s]  Guys, remember when we went to the trampoline park?
[4484.58s -> 4485.22s]  Yeah, it was fun.
[4486.02s -> 4487.86s]  Steve clipped split his pants.
[4488.58s -> 4490.18s]  Oh, yeah, I did.
[4491.14s -> 4491.46s]  Whoa.
[4493.86s -> 4494.58s]  Help me.
[4495.30s -> 4496.26s]  I'm such a simple.
[4509.83s -> 4510.55s]  Does that help us?
[4512.50s -> 4515.70s]  Well, it lets you do this thing to get up on the thing.
[4516.98s -> 4518.42s]  But then you guys have to get up here, too.
[4523.37s -> 4524.25s]  So how do you get up here?
[4525.05s -> 4525.29s]  Uh.
[4527.16s -> 4527.96s]  Do I need you?
[4527.96s -> 4529.48s]  Wait, I might have to do it.
[4529.48s -> 4529.72s]  Okay.
[4530.84s -> 4531.72s]  He's just a gamer.
[4531.72s -> 4532.28s]  That's all it is.
[4533.08s -> 4534.36s]  That looked totally wrong.
[4544.92s -> 4546.04s]  Let go, German.
[4546.04s -> 4546.44s]  Do I?
[4548.54s -> 4548.78s]  Yeah.
[4550.09s -> 4551.29s]  Well, there's a little hook on it,
[4551.29s -> 4552.57s]  so it makes me want to participate.
[4552.57s -> 4553.53s]  You go there.
[4553.53s -> 4554.33s]  Where he's standing.
[4567.43s -> 4567.83s]  Smash.
[4568.63s -> 4568.87s]  Yeah.
[4570.71s -> 4573.13s]  It's very satisfying.
[4573.93s -> 4577.30s]  Dude, I just love smashing.
[4577.30s -> 4579.86s]  Remember when Star spit on German's pizza?
[4579.86s -> 4580.10s]  What?
[4581.82s -> 4582.30s]  Oh, yeah.
[4582.30s -> 4582.94s]  Yeah.
[4582.94s -> 4583.90s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[4583.90s -> 4584.70s]  What are you talking about?
[4584.70s -> 4585.10s]  What do you mean?
[4585.10s -> 4586.70s]  Remember when you spit on my pizza?
[4587.82s -> 4588.46s]  Yeah.
[4588.46s -> 4590.62s]  Did you tell like a story or like laugh out loud?
[4590.62s -> 4592.14s]  I spit on Jeremy's pizza.
[4592.86s -> 4596.22s]  I didn't want you to find out like this.
[4597.80s -> 4600.44s]  It's actually really funny that this is the first time you're hearing of it.
[4601.00s -> 4601.32s]  Yeah.
[4602.20s -> 4603.80s]  This is often you walk in a train.
[4606.74s -> 4607.78s]  Yeah, I can't get those.
[4607.78s -> 4609.06s]  I can't get the bonus.
[4609.06s -> 4610.42s]  Bonus bits in there.
[4610.42s -> 4611.62s]  What do you mean you can't get the bonus bits?
[4612.34s -> 4613.78s]  Ashley can get the bonus bits.
[4618.10s -> 4618.42s]  Wow.
[4618.42s -> 4622.26s]  Imagine that's the only person who isn't a streamer getting the bonus bits.
[4622.26s -> 4623.86s]  Hey, we were going to do a thing.
[4624.66s -> 4630.50s]  Do you remember the like you spit a huge disgusting loogie in my drink and I drank it?
[4630.50s -> 4631.14s]  Do you remember that?
[4631.14s -> 4633.38s]  Yeah, that was weird, though, because you wanted it.
[4634.50s -> 4635.46s]  This one you didn't know about.
[4635.46s -> 4636.18s]  It's your idea.
[4636.18s -> 4636.50s]  All right.
[4636.50s -> 4642.74s]  So you guys remember the like the Star comes in by breaks in my window stream, right?
[4642.74s -> 4643.78s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4643.78s -> 4646.58s]  We're going to do a thing where when he was sitting down, we were talking.
[4647.30s -> 4651.62s]  He was I was going to get up to do something and he was going to do a disgusting, real,
[4651.62s -> 4654.98s]  huge like Skittles loogie into the drink that was on the table.
[4655.86s -> 4660.42s]  And then I was going to come back and without changing a frame or a cut for it,
[4660.42s -> 4662.02s]  I was going to drink all of it.
[4662.02s -> 4663.06s]  Like whatever.
[4663.06s -> 4666.26s]  It was going to be like a like four or five gulps left in my soda.
[4666.26s -> 4669.30s]  And I was going to do the whole thing and it was going to be in frame the whole time.
[4669.30s -> 4671.30s]  Oh, that's tastes different than I remember.
[4671.30s -> 4675.22s]  And then I was going to say you missed that taste, don't you?
[4675.22s -> 4676.90s]  And then I was not allowed to say that.
[4676.90s -> 4677.22s]  Yeah.
[4677.22s -> 4678.18s]  No, you were not.
[4679.06s -> 4681.70s]  That's why we can't because I knew you could do that.
[4682.74s -> 4686.82s]  So that's why I was like, no, it was going to be we try and kill each other.
[4686.82s -> 4687.06s]  Yes.
[4687.06s -> 4690.66s]  We were like trying to poison each other, but it evolved.
[4690.66s -> 4695.54s]  We I was I was going to go get like a cup, like two cups, like, hey, here you go.
[4695.54s -> 4696.34s]  We're what are you?
[4696.34s -> 4697.06s]  Are you thirsty?
[4697.70s -> 4701.22s]  And you know, we're going to do the two cups, one of them's poison thing.
[4701.86s -> 4703.86s]  And each time that one of us for the cup.
[4704.58s -> 4705.38s]  No, don't do that.
[4707.05s -> 4710.01s]  And we were going to be switching the we were going to both know,
[4710.01s -> 4711.93s]  like I was going to try to poison star.
[4711.93s -> 4712.41s]  Right.
[4712.41s -> 4715.77s]  And he was going to be like, I, you know, chat, like, I know what's going on here.
[4717.05s -> 4717.55s]  What?
[4718.17s -> 4722.89s]  And he was going to switch the cups around and then he was going to poison one and switch it.
[4723.69s -> 4724.81s]  You guys ever seen Princess Bride?
[4726.54s -> 4726.78s]  Yes.
[4726.78s -> 4727.34s]  Great movie.
[4728.22s -> 4730.46s]  You know, that scene where he's like,
[4730.46s -> 4733.50s]  and then I switched the poison because you switched the poisons.
[4733.50s -> 4735.82s]  Therefore, I've got the poison in front of me.
[4736.62s -> 4737.82s]  That is a classic.
[4737.82s -> 4739.02s]  It's a classic piece of cinema.
[4739.82s -> 4740.62s]  We're going to do that.
[4741.34s -> 4742.54s]  Both of them are going to be poisoned.
[4743.26s -> 4744.38s]  And it was just the whole stream.
[4744.38s -> 4746.62s]  We're going to be switching back and forth poison cups.
[4750.81s -> 4752.01s]  And we've all can drink them.
[4756.28s -> 4757.88s]  Why didn't you do any of this?
[4757.88s -> 4761.08s]  Because we were just like, we probably can't like do this.
[4761.96s -> 4763.06s]  Why not?
[4763.06s -> 4763.94s]  I forget.
[4763.94s -> 4768.73s]  I forget why we didn't do it.
[4768.73s -> 4771.53s]  Because there's probably something in like the Twitch Terms of Service
[4771.53s -> 4774.17s]  where you can't pretend to poison each other on stream.
[4775.45s -> 4777.85s]  I'm sure there's something exists there.
[4779.26s -> 4780.06s]  Where was the harm?
[4784.55s -> 4786.07s]  Star wasn't going to pretend.
[4787.99s -> 4789.67s]  You actually bring poison.
[4790.63s -> 4792.07s]  Yeah, it's funny joke.
[4792.07s -> 4793.67s]  Who's going to drink the poison?
[4796.98s -> 4798.90s]  Guys, I haven't done anything for like two full minutes.
[4798.90s -> 4799.40s]  Are we good?
[4800.18s -> 4800.90s]  We're good.
[4800.90s -> 4801.62s]  We're good.
[4801.62s -> 4803.62s]  You know how hard it is to order poison on the internet?
[4804.50s -> 4805.70s]  I would hope impossible.
[4806.82s -> 4808.82s]  Well, it's not, but it's pretty hard.
[4810.98s -> 4813.54s]  Okay, I can attach.
[4814.26s -> 4815.62s]  There you go.
[4816.26s -> 4817.62s]  I watched like a murder trial.
[4817.62s -> 4820.26s]  This guy was like the most unsure murderer of all time.
[4820.98s -> 4824.10s]  Coming up with all these different very schemes to get rid of this guy.
[4825.30s -> 4826.90s]  He did a lot of research.
[4826.90s -> 4829.62s]  So I thought a lot about ordering poison on the internet.
[4832.82s -> 4833.62s]  Why does she know?
[4839.64s -> 4840.68s]  Oh, there's big ones up there.
[4840.68s -> 4843.72s]  Oh, we need more bounties.
[4843.72s -> 4844.92s]  We need more bounces.
[4844.92s -> 4845.42s]  Launch me.
[4845.96s -> 4846.76s]  All right, here we go.
[4848.95s -> 4850.15s]  You got to shoot it.
[4850.15s -> 4850.87s]  I got to shoot it.
[4850.87s -> 4853.59s]  Okay, let's do it.
[4855.35s -> 4856.55s]  Those weren't even big.
[4856.55s -> 4858.81s]  Come on, this was a lot.
[4861.69s -> 4862.81s]  Hog incoming.
[4862.81s -> 4863.37s]  Get down.
[4873.22s -> 4874.42s]  I'm main ball.
[4875.30s -> 4879.80s]  Oh, I'm this ball.
[4879.88s -> 4880.44s]  Can I shoot through?
[4880.44s -> 4881.96s]  I can't get off of it.
[4889.56s -> 4890.44s]  What does this do for us?
[4892.65s -> 4893.45s]  No, you need to pull that.
[4893.45s -> 4894.33s]  Ah, yeah.
[4895.13s -> 4896.65s]  Oh my God, the brain.
[4897.53s -> 4898.49s]  You didn't say to do that.
[4903.03s -> 4904.79s]  He was complimenting my brain.
[4904.79s -> 4906.07s]  I was complimenting Jeremiah.
[4906.07s -> 4908.31s]  I think he is much smarter than anyone gives him credit for.
[4910.47s -> 4913.91s]  Who else would tell other people to spit a drink so that they could drink it?
[4916.79s -> 4917.51s]  We need to get there.
[4918.47s -> 4923.56s]  Yeah, because I wanted to have it completely in frame the whole time.
[4923.56s -> 4925.56s]  Like that soda does not move.
[4926.44s -> 4929.78s]  I think if you don't do it now after you describe it, that makes you a coward.
[4929.78s -> 4930.74s]  Like there's no...
[4930.74s -> 4931.94s]  Guys, there's all kinds of shit up here.
[4932.66s -> 4933.98s]  Yeah, are you getting it?
[4934.62s -> 4935.82s]  You guys have to get up here.
[4935.82s -> 4939.10s]  There's like all this light and bouncing and spinning and...
[4940.06s -> 4946.89s]  I need Steve to stop that.
[4947.45s -> 4955.00s]  Every time I think you're going to grab something, you grab the opposite item.
[4955.00s -> 4956.60s]  That would be disgusting.
[4960.90s -> 4961.54s]  Hold on.
[4961.54s -> 4964.98s]  Jerma is on weapons-grade laxatives right now.
[4966.02s -> 4966.52s]  Jump up.
[4967.14s -> 4967.64s]  What?
[4970.86s -> 4972.30s]  Steve?
[4973.24s -> 4973.88s]  What's going on?
[4973.88s -> 4975.00s]  What are you guys doing?
[4975.00s -> 4975.48s]  I can't...
[4975.48s -> 4975.98s]  Oh.
[4976.68s -> 4977.96s]  Me jump.
[4977.96s -> 4978.76s]  God damn it.
[4979.48s -> 4980.44s]  We're such fucking...
[4980.44s -> 4980.76s]  Get on.
[4980.76s -> 4981.40s]  I can't move.
[4981.40s -> 4982.04s]  Me jump.
[4983.00s -> 4988.44s]  All right, now let me...
[4989.75s -> 4991.19s]  All right, I'm holding it.
[4991.83s -> 4992.95s]  Oh God, that helps.
[4994.34s -> 4994.84s]  Star?
[4996.30s -> 4996.94s]  We're good.
[4996.94s -> 4997.34s]  We're good.
[4997.34s -> 4998.54s]  We just had a moment.
[4998.54s -> 4999.66s]  Just look at all this stuff in here.
[4999.66s -> 5001.10s]  There's like a key in there and shit.
[5001.90s -> 5004.26s]  Whoa, what does that do?
[5006.60s -> 5008.92s]  Well, it causes the light to be black, so you have to grab this thing.
[5011.02s -> 5011.58s]  And then I think...
[5011.58s -> 5012.38s]  Nope.
[5012.38s -> 5012.88s]  Yeah.
[5014.10s -> 5014.74s]  Nope.
[5014.74s -> 5016.23s]  I'll hold it the other...
[5017.11s -> 5017.67s]  I'm holding it.
[5019.69s -> 5020.89s]  It's pulling me.
[5020.89s -> 5021.77s]  Wait, I have to attach it.
[5022.74s -> 5023.24s]  Got it.
[5025.74s -> 5028.12s]  No, that's not how it...
[5028.12s -> 5029.16s]  Why is that not working?
[5029.16s -> 5030.36s]  Why did it get longer?
[5030.92s -> 5031.42s]  There we go.
[5032.12s -> 5032.84s]  Whatever.
[5032.84s -> 5033.34s]  What's in there?
[5034.06s -> 5035.50s]  I found a part of my door.
[5036.38s -> 5040.76s]  The whole quest was for home improvement.
[5040.76s -> 5041.40s]  We got points.
[5043.00s -> 5043.64s]  I got a skill.
[5043.64s -> 5044.28s]  Did you get a skill?
[5044.28s -> 5045.96s]  The rest is Prince and then redo his house.
[5045.96s -> 5047.08s]  Oh yeah, we got skills!
[5047.08s -> 5047.80s]  That's what I...
[5047.80s -> 5049.32s]  And that was a smart thing.
[5052.17s -> 5053.37s]  I don't want this skill.
[5053.37s -> 5054.49s]  That skill's dumb.
[5054.49s -> 5056.17s]  I don't want to upgrade the other people.
[5056.17s -> 5056.97s]  I want to upgrade me.
[5059.29s -> 5060.49s]  Yeah, I want to upgrade me too.
[5061.13s -> 5062.33s]  I don't want to just upgrade somebody.
[5062.33s -> 5063.53s]  Fuck you guys.
[5063.53s -> 5064.65s]  I don't want that skill.
[5066.17s -> 5067.29s]  I think you just like...
[5068.33s -> 5070.57s]  There's like five skills in these trees.
[5070.57s -> 5071.93s]  I think you just take them.
[5071.93s -> 5072.33s]  All right.
[5072.33s -> 5073.29s]  No, I want to...
[5073.29s -> 5074.41s]  I don't want that skill.
[5075.45s -> 5078.86s]  I know, I'm just...
[5078.86s -> 5079.66s]  I was doing my parts.
[5088.99s -> 5089.49s]  It'll move it.
[5090.51s -> 5091.15s]  Just give it some...
[5091.15s -> 5091.87s]  Just give it some time.
[5094.27s -> 5095.13s]  Give it a minute.
[5095.85s -> 5097.02s]  There it goes.
[5097.82s -> 5105.58s]  Does anybody else feel like they've been on this first level for like three hours?
[5106.38s -> 5107.98s]  This is not the first level.
[5107.98s -> 5109.42s]  Well, I mean like the first real level.
[5110.46s -> 5111.74s]  That was last level.
[5111.74s -> 5113.34s]  Oh wait, let him stand on it.
[5113.98s -> 5119.60s]  The bird?
[5119.60s -> 5120.64s]  You're being kind of stupid.
[5121.53s -> 5122.17s]  No offense.
[5122.17s -> 5122.81s]  I think he just...
[5122.81s -> 5123.37s]  Yeah, just jump.
[5127.74s -> 5129.42s]  You didn't even held it with arrows?
[5130.40s -> 5132.48s]  I knocked one arrow over there.
[5133.12s -> 5133.84s]  Like...
[5133.84s -> 5134.72s]  Well, that's so funny.
[5138.46s -> 5141.31s]  I wanted the bird to do a reaction video.
[5144.44s -> 5146.12s]  Massive bird!
[5146.12s -> 5147.64s]  A reaction video.
[5148.84s -> 5151.16s]  Have you been watching reaction videos?
[5151.16s -> 5152.44s]  You keep bringing them up.
[5152.44s -> 5152.68s]  No.
[5153.32s -> 5156.68s]  That usually indicates that you're secretly watching them and are guilty about it.
[5156.68s -> 5158.76s]  I'm not this linear of a character, Ashley.
[5159.88s -> 5160.52s]  You are though.
[5162.12s -> 5163.00s]  Am I hurting my back?
[5163.88s -> 5165.08s]  Jeremy, you gotta go get this.
[5165.72s -> 5165.96s]  Yep.
[5167.61s -> 5169.13s]  I weigh like 300 pounds.
[5169.13s -> 5171.13s]  You can't expect me to do things like this.
[5176.83s -> 5178.99s]  Whoa, he lived for...
[5178.99s -> 5181.15s]  Well, I jumped too early.
[5181.15s -> 5181.79s]  Too late to me.
[5181.79s -> 5183.07s]  Oh, he got the credit for living.
[5183.71s -> 5186.35s]  Hey, by the way, speaking of like the react videos,
[5186.35s -> 5188.43s]  I saw your like Star React stream.
[5189.31s -> 5190.27s]  I know, you were there.
[5190.91s -> 5191.55s]  It was pretty good.
[5192.83s -> 5194.11s]  What would you rate it out of ten?
[5195.07s -> 5195.31s]  Four.
[5196.51s -> 5197.79s]  Four out of ten.
[5197.79s -> 5199.47s]  Wow, that's better than usual.
[5201.63s -> 5201.95s]  No.
[5203.71s -> 5204.83s]  Four out of ten.
[5204.83s -> 5206.83s]  No, it was like an eight and a half.
[5207.95s -> 5210.92s]  What would have made it a ten, in your opinion, if you took your shirt off?
[5213.00s -> 5213.82s]  Maybe like a...
[5220.76s -> 5221.40s]  Less music.
[5224.73s -> 5226.17s]  Jazz, you're not a fan of the jazz?
[5227.05s -> 5227.93s]  No music.
[5227.93s -> 5228.49s]  Durn it all.
[5232.38s -> 5232.86s]  I got him.
[5232.86s -> 5233.34s]  We can go.
[5240.68s -> 5241.16s]  Found him.
[5241.16s -> 5241.96s]  He's here.
[5241.96s -> 5242.28s]  Wow.
[5242.28s -> 5242.76s]  Get him over here.
[5242.76s -> 5244.99s]  You must be the prince we're looking for.
[5244.99s -> 5246.27s]  Good thing too.
[5246.27s -> 5247.31s]  I was afraid you'd been eaten by wolves.
[5247.31s -> 5248.35s]  We missed Bloods.
[5248.35s -> 5249.15s]  I'm being rushed.
[5249.95s -> 5251.15s]  What do you want with me?
[5252.25s -> 5254.65s]  We're taking you to the safety of the Astral Academy.
[5255.45s -> 5256.09s]  What?
[5256.09s -> 5257.61s]  I'm not going back there.
[5257.61s -> 5259.90s]  You think we'd leave you alone in the middle of...
[5259.90s -> 5260.54s]  We're here.
[5261.26s -> 5264.38s]  Look, I don't care if you're a prince or a pig keeper.
[5264.38s -> 5265.18s]  You're coming with us.
[5265.82s -> 5268.06s]  I'm not a child to be told what to do.
[5268.86s -> 5269.42s]  Red eyes.
[5270.46s -> 5272.12s]  Okay, so the next cutscene we have,
[5273.16s -> 5275.72s]  we have to mute the whole game.
[5275.72s -> 5277.00s]  And then each of our characters,
[5277.00s -> 5279.40s]  each one of us has to do the dialogue on the bottom of the screen.
[5282.43s -> 5283.07s]  Am I muted?
[5283.07s -> 5283.31s]  Okay.
[5284.03s -> 5284.75s]  Yeah, no, okay.
[5286.59s -> 5290.04s]  You have to turn subtitles on.
[5290.60s -> 5292.52s]  Yeah, turn subtitles on and then...
[5292.52s -> 5293.24s]  Oh, hold on.
[5295.61s -> 5296.41s]  It's like a giant.
[5297.69s -> 5299.21s]  Why can't I fucking move?
[5299.37s -> 5305.07s]  Oh, why does this happen?
[5305.07s -> 5309.10s]  There's a wolf eating you.
[5311.18s -> 5311.42s]  Okay.
[5313.63s -> 5315.55s]  I clicked in the window like five times.
[5316.67s -> 5317.47s]  You got a rhizome.
[5318.27s -> 5318.83s]  I do.
[5321.50s -> 5322.86s]  I don't know why this does this.
[5324.72s -> 5326.88s]  Exclusive window, except I clicked in it.
[5334.75s -> 5337.15s]  I'm dead.
[5338.35s -> 5338.91s]  No, you're not.
[5341.56s -> 5353.95s]  Oh, a giant nightmare wolf.
[5357.24s -> 5359.08s]  That really is literally its name.
[5359.88s -> 5361.32s]  Giant nightmare wolf.
[5361.32s -> 5361.80s]  That's our...
[5363.08s -> 5364.36s]  Not the one, a one.
[5365.24s -> 5368.83s]  Oh, I should have blocked that.
[5370.35s -> 5373.90s]  Harder than stiff.
[5373.90s -> 5374.14s]  Yeah.
[5375.18s -> 5375.74s]  Almost dead.
[5392.27s -> 5392.91s]  This doesn't count.
[5393.71s -> 5396.99s]  Uh, I say we knock him unconscious and carry him back to the Astral Academy.
[5398.73s -> 5402.41s]  Um, Ashley, how come you didn't run up to the prince and drive your sword through his chest?
[5403.21s -> 5405.29s]  I did, but the cutscene lagging in place.
[5406.73s -> 5407.13s]  Hello?
[5408.25s -> 5408.49s]  What?
[5411.79s -> 5412.51s]  In my mind, I did.
[5414.48s -> 5415.28s]  All right, everybody.
[5416.72s -> 5419.60s]  For a second, just quickly, can we hit start?
[5419.60s -> 5420.00s]  All of you.
[5420.80s -> 5421.52s]  Go to options.
[5422.08s -> 5422.56s]  Just hit start.
[5422.56s -> 5423.12s]  Go to options.
[5423.92s -> 5425.84s]  Go to dialogue.
[5425.84s -> 5427.04s]  Bring dialogue to zero.
[5428.08s -> 5429.20s]  And then, uh, confirm.
[5430.72s -> 5434.20s]  Because the next cutscene, we're going to do our characters.
[5434.76s -> 5435.16s]  Voices.
[5435.72s -> 5436.04s]  Okay.
[5436.92s -> 5437.24s]  Okay.
[5450.40s -> 5451.76s]  I can't wait for this to happen, though.
[5454.16s -> 5455.28s]  I meet one, by the way.
[5456.16s -> 5458.27s]  You just do meet one.
[5458.91s -> 5460.67s]  I mean, I'm a bad impression of meet one.
[5460.67s -> 5461.79s]  That's what it is.
[5461.79s -> 5462.99s]  What's with the snapping?
[5462.99s -> 5463.47s]  Look at this.
[5463.47s -> 5463.79s]  Come on.
[5465.95s -> 5470.64s]  Wait, hold on.
[5470.64s -> 5473.12s]  Everyone was just on board with this 15 seconds ago.
[5473.12s -> 5473.92s]  And all of a sudden, I hit...
[5473.92s -> 5475.52s]  I go in the options and actually turn it off.
[5475.52s -> 5477.12s]  And now we're not on board with it anymore?
[5477.68s -> 5478.16s]  We're on board.
[5478.16s -> 5478.88s]  What are you talking about?
[5478.88s -> 5481.12s]  No, I'm talking about the fucking crowd.
[5482.56s -> 5484.24s]  Oh, the crowd doesn't want this?
[5484.96s -> 5485.52s]  Cringe.
[5486.72s -> 5487.76s]  Cringe, dude.
[5488.88s -> 5492.56s]  You're going to pretend to be a cringe, dude.
[5492.56s -> 5493.44s]  That's so cringe.
[5494.40s -> 5495.20s]  What the fuck?
[5498.25s -> 5498.57s]  I don't...
[5502.03s -> 5504.91s]  Do I attach to this and then attach to that?
[5506.16s -> 5508.16s]  Uh, go up there and push the top one in.
[5509.12s -> 5510.73s]  To the top right.
[5511.37s -> 5511.93s]  Can I just...
[5511.93s -> 5513.05s]  I don't think I can do that.
[5513.05s -> 5514.33s]  Jump on top of this box.
[5518.08s -> 5519.58s]  I mean, I can't...
[5519.58s -> 5520.86s]  Oh, but you can just grab it.
[5521.98s -> 5525.74s]  All right, I'm picking one of them.
[5526.46s -> 5528.38s]  Can you shoot the top one?
[5528.38s -> 5530.68s]  Wow.
[5530.68s -> 5532.67s]  Oh, that worked.
[5532.67s -> 5534.80s]  Whoa.
[5534.80s -> 5535.52s]  Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[5536.24s -> 5543.05s]  Well, now I'm never noticing when the characters talk.
[5543.93s -> 5545.24s]  Because we turned it off.
[5546.60s -> 5546.92s]  Yeah.
[5548.06s -> 5550.62s]  Well, now it has talked because the subtitles are on.
[5551.42s -> 5553.34s]  Yeah, no, our characters have said things.
[5563.04s -> 5564.24s]  Stars are really watching his performance.
[5564.24s -> 5564.80s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[5564.80s -> 5565.28s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[5569.45s -> 5570.41s]  I have to put it on the wall,
[5570.41s -> 5571.69s]  otherwise we're going to jump forward and die
[5571.69s -> 5573.05s]  and I can't move it because Jerma's on it.
[5573.93s -> 5574.49s]  Well, go for it.
[5574.49s -> 5576.09s]  Now it's roped so I can't move it further.
[5577.37s -> 5579.18s]  But now you got to rope it.
[5579.82s -> 5580.60s]  There you go.
[5589.71s -> 5590.03s]  Uh-oh.
[5590.84s -> 5591.24s]  Bugs.
[5592.20s -> 5593.48s]  The nightmare spider.
[5599.45s -> 5601.05s]  As I feel, I do more damage than you.
[5602.01s -> 5602.41s]  Than me?
[5603.13s -> 5604.09s]  Than Ashley.
[5604.33s -> 5604.97s]  You're the wizard.
[5604.97s -> 5606.57s]  The wizard can get nerfed like 10 times.
[5608.49s -> 5609.69s]  Cringe spider.
[5610.33s -> 5611.61s]  See, your character's talking.
[5612.49s -> 5613.05s]  The wizards.
[5613.93s -> 5614.89s]  No, no, no, this doesn't count.
[5615.53s -> 5616.65s]  No, it doesn't count.
[5616.65s -> 5617.93s]  Okay, it doesn't count.
[5617.93s -> 5619.53s]  It has to be in a cut scene.
[5619.53s -> 5620.49s]  All right, we'll turn it back on.
[5622.17s -> 5622.81s]  You gave up?
[5623.69s -> 5624.41s]  Well, just into...
[5624.41s -> 5626.41s]  Wait, once we get to the end of the level, turn it off.
[5627.29s -> 5628.25s]  This is going to be like...
[5628.25s -> 5631.53s]  Always these gigantic $20,000 schemes.
[5631.53s -> 5632.41s]  Fire arrows?
[5632.41s -> 5633.53s]  What the fuck?
[5637.90s -> 5640.46s]  Holy shit, I'm way cooler than everybody in this game now.
[5641.10s -> 5643.05s]  How'd you get fired?
[5644.17s -> 5645.21s]  They just gave it to me.
[5645.21s -> 5646.41s]  No, I just gave it to them, dude.
[5646.41s -> 5647.53s]  They just gave it to them.
[5647.53s -> 5649.45s]  Ice arrows to freeze the rotating pla...
[5649.45s -> 5650.73s]  Oh my god, they're just giving it to them.
[5651.93s -> 5652.73s]  This is so cool.
[5653.61s -> 5655.13s]  Freeze the platform.
[5655.13s -> 5656.17s]  So I think you have to get off it.
[5656.89s -> 5659.85s]  Because I have to freeze it, right?
[5659.85s -> 5660.33s]  So it needs to...
[5661.50s -> 5661.98s]  Huh.
[5661.98s -> 5662.46s]  Yeah, get off.
[5662.46s -> 5662.86s]  Get off it.
[5662.86s -> 5664.70s]  Watch out with your noodly wizard arms.
[5664.70s -> 5665.74s]  Now I go like this.
[5665.74s -> 5666.62s]  And it's frozen.
[5666.62s -> 5667.82s]  And now we can get up there.
[5669.23s -> 5670.11s]  I don't know why it wasn't...
[5672.43s -> 5673.23s]  Is it...
[5673.23s -> 5674.83s]  I can't get my box through.
[5674.83s -> 5675.31s]  Hold on.
[5676.27s -> 5679.87s]  Oh, shit.
[5681.39s -> 5683.15s]  Ah, shit.
[5683.15s -> 5684.59s]  Well, it's frozen, so we can do that now.
[5685.15s -> 5686.83s]  Just need a box or something around.
[5689.50s -> 5692.70s]  I don't like that Jerma's character is going to be doing things.
[5693.74s -> 5694.78s]  No, I know.
[5694.78s -> 5695.74s]  What a disaster.
[5704.25s -> 5705.37s]  He has to freeze them.
[5706.57s -> 5707.37s]  Come on.
[5707.37s -> 5709.21s]  Oh, one at a time.
[5709.21s -> 5709.93s]  One at a time.
[5711.13s -> 5711.63s]  Yeah.
[5714.16s -> 5715.36s]  Just stay on the first one.
[5717.39s -> 5717.71s]  And then...
[5718.99s -> 5719.47s]  Yeah.
[5719.47s -> 5720.51s]  Like, I mean, I can...
[5720.51s -> 5720.99s]  Like...
[5720.99s -> 5722.25s]  Yeah, just...
[5722.25s -> 5723.53s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5723.53s -> 5724.57s]  Well, let me at least get on here.
[5725.92s -> 5726.80s]  Yeah, you can just make the jump.
[5727.74s -> 5728.46s]  You don't have to do that.
[5729.61s -> 5730.65s]  You can just make it.
[5730.65s -> 5731.93s]  Just stand on that one for a second.
[5731.93s -> 5732.73s]  And, yeah.
[5732.73s -> 5733.61s]  No, just stay...
[5733.61s -> 5735.77s]  Just let him do it his own way, Jerma.
[5737.69s -> 5738.41s]  Hold on.
[5738.41s -> 5739.69s]  I'm sorry.
[5739.69s -> 5741.13s]  You don't have to control your friends.
[5741.13s -> 5741.85s]  I'm sorry.
[5742.73s -> 5745.69s]  If I want to do something a different way, I get like...
[5745.69s -> 5746.25s]  Jerma!
[5746.25s -> 5746.73s]  Jerma!
[5746.73s -> 5747.29s]  Jerma!
[5747.29s -> 5747.69s]  Jerma!
[5747.69s -> 5748.33s]  What are you doing?
[5748.33s -> 5748.73s]  Jerma!
[5749.98s -> 5751.02s]  Jerma, get over here!
[5751.02s -> 5751.90s]  That's what we sound like.
[5753.08s -> 5754.44s]  We sound like bugs.
[5754.44s -> 5755.80s]  That's what he thinks we sound like.
[5756.44s -> 5756.94s]  Jerma!
[5758.76s -> 5759.08s]  Jerma!
[5759.08s -> 5759.32s]  Hey!
[5759.32s -> 5759.56s]  Whoa!
[5759.56s -> 5759.72s]  Hey!
[5759.72s -> 5760.20s]  What are you doing?
[5760.20s -> 5760.60s]  Hey!
[5760.60s -> 5761.00s]  That's right!
[5761.00s -> 5761.64s]  Wait!
[5761.64s -> 5762.20s]  Come on now!
[5762.20s -> 5762.52s]  Whoa!
[5762.52s -> 5762.76s]  Hey!
[5764.68s -> 5766.04s]  You guys are fucking Beetlejuice!
[5776.64s -> 5777.44s]  He said it once.
[5784.24s -> 5784.88s]  No!
[5784.88s -> 5786.91s]  I'm still alive!
[5786.91s -> 5787.39s]  I can't get it?
[5791.55s -> 5791.95s]  Yeah, I get it.
[5791.95s -> 5792.35s]  There you go.
[5795.82s -> 5796.62s]  We don't go this way.
[5798.65s -> 5799.45s]  We have to go this way.
[5799.61s -> 5800.01s]  Great.
[5803.80s -> 5805.24s]  Nice fucking bottle!
[5806.60s -> 5808.12s]  Why did I read that?
[5808.12s -> 5808.84s]  What?
[5808.84s -> 5809.80s]  Get in here!
[5809.80s -> 5810.28s]  I can't.
[5811.00s -> 5811.96s]  Yeah, you can.
[5811.96s -> 5813.40s]  What are you talking about?
[5813.40s -> 5815.64s]  I didn't realize what part of the movie that is.
[5818.41s -> 5819.13s]  Oh, shit!
[5820.17s -> 5820.97s]  Oh, shit!
[5822.73s -> 5824.57s]  Jerma, you're not doing the joke at all.
[5824.57s -> 5825.53s]  No, you don't.
[5825.53s -> 5826.33s]  Something else happened.
[5826.97s -> 5828.33s]  There's something else a little more...
[5830.17s -> 5832.09s]  I saw honk in the chat.
[5832.65s -> 5834.89s]  And I was gonna move on from that one.
[5840.52s -> 5841.48s]  There's things up there.
[5842.60s -> 5843.72s]  Every time you go like,
[5843.72s -> 5846.20s]  Oh, Jerma, I think you have like a bathroom problem.
[5847.08s -> 5848.28s]  Well, same.
[5848.28s -> 5848.76s]  We worry.
[5849.40s -> 5850.44s]  We worry about you.
[5850.44s -> 5851.40s]  Do you know that I...
[5851.40s -> 5854.68s]  You do realize that I'm on like an actual prescription grid laxative right now.
[5854.68s -> 5855.32s]  You know that, right?
[5855.32s -> 5856.20s]  That's not a joke.
[5856.20s -> 5857.72s]  Oh, no, it's not a joke.
[5859.08s -> 5860.28s]  Every time you show concern.
[5861.64s -> 5862.52s]  Where my thoughts go.
[5862.60s -> 5864.44s]  He's on a weapons grade laxative.
[5865.56s -> 5868.06s]  Oh, I froze it.
[5869.28s -> 5870.16s]  Skill point coming up.
[5870.16s -> 5871.20s]  Can I freeze your box?
[5871.92s -> 5872.80s]  I don't think so.
[5872.80s -> 5873.30s]  Oh.
[5875.68s -> 5876.56s]  How are we supposed to do that?
[5879.76s -> 5880.80s]  Get off my box.
[5880.80s -> 5883.84s]  You can rope my boxes so I can stick my box up here.
[5883.84s -> 5884.34s]  Oh, shit!
[5885.20s -> 5887.12s]  Oh, I didn't know that was gonna come down.
[5887.84s -> 5889.60s]  Wait, you can stick it there.
[5893.85s -> 5895.29s]  Okay, I can hold it up.
[5895.85s -> 5897.61s]  It might still drop when you wait.
[5897.61s -> 5898.65s]  You waste so much.
[5899.29s -> 5900.01s]  Okay, so then...
[5900.89s -> 5901.39s]  Now what?
[5902.01s -> 5903.42s]  Now nothing.
[5903.42s -> 5904.06s]  This isn't it.
[5904.06s -> 5904.70s]  You gotta get off.
[5911.16s -> 5913.48s]  No, it's not dark web laxative.
[5913.48s -> 5913.98s]  No.
[5914.60s -> 5915.80s]  Can that stay there?
[5915.80s -> 5916.44s]  Now, what if...
[5916.44s -> 5917.00s]  Yeah.
[5917.00s -> 5917.64s]  Is there anything I can...
[5918.44s -> 5919.24s]  What about freezing it?
[5919.24s -> 5919.88s]  Can I freeze it?
[5920.76s -> 5921.32s]  No.
[5921.32s -> 5922.12s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[5922.12s -> 5922.84s]  I'm talking about this thing.
[5922.84s -> 5923.24s]  The platform?
[5923.24s -> 5923.96s]  Yeah, the platform.
[5924.86s -> 5925.42s]  There you go.
[5925.42s -> 5926.94s]  Okay, now get off of it, Ashley.
[5926.94s -> 5928.06s]  You're ruining it, Ashley.
[5929.71s -> 5930.35s]  Now you got me.
[5930.35s -> 5931.23s]  Now you gotta grapple up.
[5933.32s -> 5933.96s]  Look at you.
[5933.96s -> 5934.92s]  Look at you, man.
[5934.92s -> 5935.96s]  Oh, a blue quill.
[5935.96s -> 5937.00s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[5939.95s -> 5940.59s]  Upgrade point.
[5942.19s -> 5946.76s]  You have two available upgrade points.
[5946.76s -> 5947.88s]  I can upgrade...
[5947.88s -> 5949.00s]  Ooh, what's this?
[5949.00s -> 5950.04s]  So many things.
[5950.84s -> 5954.28s]  20 more drops of germa blood before I can get something else.
[5955.90s -> 5959.50s]  So I think you actually have to put points into other characters.
[5960.78s -> 5961.58s]  Have to?
[5961.58s -> 5962.62s]  You don't have to.
[5962.62s -> 5963.90s]  I don't think you have to.
[5963.90s -> 5964.46s]  Well, because...
[5965.58s -> 5966.70s]  Don't let them talk.
[5966.70s -> 5967.74s]  Don't even let them talk.
[5967.74s -> 5969.90s]  The ones that are in squares, you get them as you play.
[5970.70s -> 5972.70s]  The Nightmare Prince is in the background.
[5972.70s -> 5973.58s]  Steve!
[5973.58s -> 5974.22s]  What?
[5974.22s -> 5974.94s]  I need your help.
[5974.94s -> 5975.98s]  No one's listening to me.
[5976.78s -> 5977.90s]  We don't want to hear you.
[5977.90s -> 5979.74s]  Germa, tell us about your day.
[5979.74s -> 5982.38s]  My day was pretty sick.
[5984.96s -> 5987.21s]  I need to... hold on.
[5988.17s -> 5993.05s]  Spiral arrow.
[5993.05s -> 5996.62s]  Spiral arrow.
[5996.62s -> 5997.66s]  Freeze that one real quick.
[5998.46s -> 6003.95s]  Can you guys all get up here?
[6005.24s -> 6006.04s]  Spiral arrow.
[6006.04s -> 6006.76s]  Oh.
[6006.76s -> 6008.28s]  Whoa, did you just get like an illusory wall?
[6009.24s -> 6010.28s]  No, I mean, you couldn't...
[6010.28s -> 6011.24s]  I mean, yeah, sure.
[6011.96s -> 6013.00s]  Whoa.
[6013.00s -> 6014.28s]  Let me just freeze that one real quick.
[6015.00s -> 6016.81s]  Oh my god, he froze it.
[6017.37s -> 6018.01s]  Oh my god.
[6018.81s -> 6019.69s]  Oh, shit.
[6019.69s -> 6020.19s]  No!
[6024.78s -> 6025.66s]  Can you break through this gate?
[6026.62s -> 6028.00s]  How do we open it?
[6028.00s -> 6028.32s]  How would...
[6028.32s -> 6028.88s]  Yeah, there you go.
[6029.68s -> 6031.92s]  And you get the spoils in the middle.
[6032.64s -> 6034.91s]  So spoiled now.
[6036.83s -> 6037.95s]  You never told us about your day.
[6037.95s -> 6039.39s]  I thought you wanted us to listen.
[6041.74s -> 6042.22s]  Wait, hold on.
[6042.22s -> 6044.06s]  Use ice arrows to make ice raft.
[6044.86s -> 6045.95s]  What?
[6045.95s -> 6046.51s]  Ice car.
[6048.72s -> 6050.08s]  Okay, so that's cool.
[6050.16s -> 6052.40s]  How come your character gets to do everything now?
[6052.40s -> 6054.24s]  Because you chose wrong.
[6055.28s -> 6057.63s]  So stick it on there so we can do it right,
[6057.63s -> 6058.67s]  or I'll just jump on it.
[6059.63s -> 6061.37s]  Yeah, you don't even need me anymore
[6061.37s -> 6063.69s]  because you get ice arrows and fire arrows and...
[6064.65s -> 6066.73s]  Yeah, just wait till we get to the wizard level where I can...
[6066.73s -> 6069.40s]  Oh, do the voices.
[6069.40s -> 6070.04s]  No, it's too late.
[6070.04s -> 6070.52s]  It's too late.
[6070.52s -> 6071.16s]  Do the voices.
[6072.12s -> 6073.72s]  Because we don't have an actor.
[6073.72s -> 6074.68s]  He doesn't have a voice.
[6076.59s -> 6079.07s]  The wizard gave you a magic talisman.
[6079.07s -> 6079.87s]  What does it do?
[6081.87s -> 6082.51s]  He doesn't have one.
[6084.19s -> 6086.35s]  You were just the demon inside of that guy's head
[6086.35s -> 6087.23s]  while he was talking.
[6087.23s -> 6088.83s]  You were feeding him blinds.
[6088.83s -> 6089.55s]  That was great.
[6089.55s -> 6092.03s]  That was great that we all collectively did that
[6092.03s -> 6093.07s]  during the next cut scene.
[6093.07s -> 6093.79s]  That was awesome.
[6093.79s -> 6094.91s]  I'm turning my dialogue back on.
[6102.17s -> 6104.09s]  I'm so glad I got to be the wizard to talk.
[6104.89s -> 6109.40s]  Like I said, I got a big one and nobody cared.
[6111.29s -> 6112.49s]  Wow, you got a big one.
[6118.59s -> 6119.63s]  I can actually freeze them.
[6121.66s -> 6122.22s]  Oh, wow.
[6122.22s -> 6122.78s]  Holy shit.
[6122.78s -> 6124.30s]  They made this character awesome.
[6124.94s -> 6128.59s]  You can do everything.
[6136.51s -> 6137.95s]  I call that perfect timing.
[6137.95s -> 6138.59s]  What would you call it?
[6140.41s -> 6142.25s]  If that was one of those like arcade machines
[6142.25s -> 6144.41s]  where you got to wait for the lights to come around the circle
[6144.41s -> 6145.93s]  and then when the light is on the right light,
[6145.93s -> 6147.77s]  then you just go to stop and then you get the prize.
[6147.77s -> 6148.81s]  If you stop it on the light,
[6148.81s -> 6150.81s]  you would have got the prize when you touch the light.
[6150.81s -> 6151.61s]  Yeah, probably.
[6152.73s -> 6161.47s]  I love the warrior's voice.
[6161.47s -> 6162.27s]  It sounds so stupid.
[6163.15s -> 6164.70s]  You can't do better.
[6166.01s -> 6166.89s]  Why would you freeze that?
[6166.89s -> 6168.01s]  Why would you freeze that?
[6168.01s -> 6168.89s]  Unfreeze it now.
[6169.61s -> 6170.25s]  Why would you?
[6172.25s -> 6173.53s]  Jerma's throwing.
[6173.53s -> 6174.73s]  I would like a please.
[6177.52s -> 6179.44s]  Jerma's throwing?
[6180.00s -> 6181.44s]  I shot an arrow at a thing.
[6181.44s -> 6182.48s]  Oh, man.
[6182.48s -> 6185.92s]  You may as well have walked into the tower six times.
[6185.92s -> 6202.33s]  Who even knows what that puzzle was?
[6202.33s -> 6203.05s]  Who even knows?
[6215.10s -> 6215.60s]  Uh-oh.
[6216.62s -> 6221.65s]  Geiso.
[6222.27s -> 6233.77s]  Cool.
[6233.77s -> 6235.29s]  So where does this need to be frozen?
[6236.92s -> 6237.96s]  Or is it just a...
[6237.96s -> 6238.46s]  Hold on.
[6239.24s -> 6240.44s]  I think it's a butt pounder.
[6240.44s -> 6241.32s]  Is it a butt pounder?
[6241.32s -> 6242.76s]  Oh, we got to touch a thing out here.
[6245.79s -> 6246.59s]  Oh, okay.
[6246.59s -> 6247.07s]  Throw me up.
[6247.87s -> 6252.88s]  Okay, active.
[6252.88s -> 6254.88s]  And then that's a butt pounder.
[6257.92s -> 6258.88s]  But then how do you get up?
[6259.52s -> 6260.90s]  I don't know.
[6265.82s -> 6267.34s]  I think that is how you get up.
[6267.34s -> 6267.98s]  Yeah, okay.
[6267.98s -> 6268.62s]  So you get...
[6268.62s -> 6269.66s]  Is that working?
[6269.66s -> 6270.22s]  It should.
[6270.22s -> 6270.72s]  Kind of.
[6271.58s -> 6272.08s]  Whoa.
[6273.02s -> 6273.98s]  Try to...
[6273.98s -> 6275.26s]  Can you do it further away?
[6275.26s -> 6275.76s]  Yeah.
[6277.92s -> 6278.88s]  Yeah, there we go.
[6280.43s -> 6281.15s]  Dude, look at us.
[6281.15s -> 6282.19s]  The three triners.
[6282.91s -> 6285.40s]  Oh, hey, I got this.
[6288.19s -> 6289.87s]  Wow, you're so useless, Steve.
[6289.87s -> 6291.23s]  Wow, my character.
[6291.23s -> 6292.35s]  Fuck you with your ice.
[6292.35s -> 6293.63s]  It's supposed to be my job.
[6294.59s -> 6295.15s]  Not anymore.
[6295.71s -> 6297.47s]  You're not even nice with your...
[6297.47s -> 6297.79s]  Hold on.
[6297.79s -> 6299.23s]  There's something over there on the left.
[6300.11s -> 6302.08s]  Over that way.
[6305.37s -> 6306.67s]  Yep, secret.
[6307.47s -> 6309.90s]  Wow, and only you can unlock it, Jerome.
[6313.20s -> 6314.32s]  Stop throwing that in here.
[6314.32s -> 6314.88s]  I need to...
[6315.92s -> 6317.28s]  I think that actually helped somehow.
[6317.92s -> 6319.18s]  I think so, too.
[6320.06s -> 6320.62s]  Get me out.
[6321.42s -> 6322.38s]  Go up around.
[6322.38s -> 6322.70s]  And then...
[6323.82s -> 6324.62s]  Now I'll pull you in.
[6327.82s -> 6328.32s]  Nope.
[6329.08s -> 6329.72s]  What?
[6329.72s -> 6331.31s]  You gotta walk all the way to the right.
[6331.31s -> 6332.19s]  Okay, yeah, you go.
[6332.19s -> 6332.69s]  Okay.
[6333.39s -> 6333.89s]  Okay.
[6334.67s -> 6335.17s]  Big brain.
[6337.02s -> 6338.30s]  Not even an ice wizard.
[6340.49s -> 6342.01s]  That's very humiliating for him.
[6343.05s -> 6345.37s]  My favorite wizard is ball lightning.
[6345.37s -> 6346.25s]  I'm a wizard.
[6346.25s -> 6347.13s]  You're not a lightning wizard either.
[6347.13s -> 6348.09s]  I am lightning.
[6348.09s -> 6349.93s]  I'm ice and fire wizard.
[6349.93s -> 6351.77s]  You're just guy that can pick stuff up...
[6352.49s -> 6353.05s]  Up ground.
[6354.01s -> 6355.05s]  I make box.
[6360.19s -> 6361.63s]  Yeah, make one of my box now.
[6362.35s -> 6363.07s]  Well, I just...
[6363.07s -> 6363.87s]  I did.
[6363.87s -> 6366.03s]  Because now we need your box to hold that down.
[6366.67s -> 6368.32s]  Do you see what's happening here?
[6369.04s -> 6370.60s]  You need your box in there.
[6371.64s -> 6372.76s]  So then she can get in.
[6374.27s -> 6374.99s]  Wow.
[6374.99s -> 6375.63s]  Box guy.
[6375.63s -> 6377.15s]  Hey, take it from an ice wizard.
[6377.87s -> 6379.77s]  Oh, wow.
[6379.77s -> 6380.33s]  Thanks, Jerome.
[6380.33s -> 6380.89s]  That was cool.
[6383.13s -> 6386.60s]  Remember that time you gave me your sandwich?
[6387.72s -> 6390.84s]  Princelius, why are your wolves and spiders attacking us?
[6390.84s -> 6392.12s]  Do you really want us dead?
[6392.12s -> 6392.60s]  No, I don't.
[6393.48s -> 6395.64s]  Nightmash just appear on their own.
[6395.64s -> 6396.97s]  I control them.
[6396.97s -> 6398.83s]  That's we lost it.
[6402.01s -> 6402.97s]  Satan.
[6402.97s -> 6404.09s]  Reading for the character.
[6406.52s -> 6407.72s]  Satan's audition tape.
[6408.44s -> 6409.40s]  We're trying for...
[6410.28s -> 6417.61s]  I am Asmodeus, wizard.
[6420.46s -> 6421.02s]  Sorry, Satan.
[6421.02s -> 6424.06s]  We think we're going in a more lighthearted direction with this one.
[6425.02s -> 6428.36s]  Okay, I'm a better wizard than you,
[6428.36s -> 6430.68s]  but you kill things faster than both of us.
[6430.68s -> 6432.20s]  Because you just drop box on head.
[6432.84s -> 6434.60s]  It is true.
[6434.60s -> 6436.84s]  You do a shit ton of damage for no reason.
[6436.84s -> 6438.60s]  I've one shot every enemy so far.
[6443.36s -> 6444.96s]  Put box on head or pre-recorded.
[6444.96s -> 6445.92s]  Well, you have to do that one.
[6446.72s -> 6448.40s]  I mean, that's just proves it at least.
[6448.40s -> 6449.92s]  If you were if you guys were here earlier,
[6449.92s -> 6452.72s]  you know that box on head is the end game.
[6453.68s -> 6455.00s]  Oh, that's right.
[6455.00s -> 6456.52s]  There might be a thing up here.
[6456.52s -> 6457.00s]  Is there?
[6457.00s -> 6457.80s]  One up.
[6457.80s -> 6458.12s]  Maybe.
[6462.75s -> 6464.73s]  I think you're gonna have to like it.
[6464.73s -> 6465.93s]  I'm gonna have to do the worms.
[6465.93s -> 6467.37s]  I'm gonna do the worms ninja rope.
[6468.35s -> 6471.76s]  Yeah, this guy knows there is something up here
[6472.40s -> 6475.20s]  and it is an elaborate thing that we need.
[6475.20s -> 6476.96s]  I think more than one person for.
[6476.96s -> 6478.24s]  Oh, okay.
[6478.24s -> 6478.64s]  Hold on.
[6478.64s -> 6480.88s]  Wait, can I drop it somehow?
[6483.71s -> 6485.07s]  Is there a thing I can shoot?
[6485.07s -> 6486.99s]  Actually, actually die already.
[6486.99s -> 6488.11s]  I don't want to die.
[6488.11s -> 6488.59s]  It hurts.
[6489.15s -> 6493.56s]  Oh, we're going to need your help to get over.
[6494.84s -> 6496.52s]  I think you got to make like a rope for us.
[6496.52s -> 6496.92s]  Do I?
[6499.05s -> 6499.93s]  Yeah, please.
[6499.93s -> 6500.97s]  With all your usefulness.
[6501.85s -> 6502.17s]  Okay.
[6502.17s -> 6510.00s]  Well, please, as the OP character,
[6510.00s -> 6512.40s]  come make come make a bridge for us to cross
[6512.40s -> 6513.76s]  like I would normally be doing.
[6514.32s -> 6514.56s]  Yeah.
[6514.56s -> 6514.80s]  Okay.
[6516.28s -> 6519.10s]  So that all right.
[6519.10s -> 6520.70s]  Now we all have to go over there
[6525.76s -> 6526.88s]  because then there's this stuff.
[6528.14s -> 6529.26s]  Sorry, I will unfreeze.
[6529.26s -> 6529.74s]  Get out the way.
[6529.74s -> 6531.58s]  I love how you're already frozen.
[6531.58s -> 6532.30s]  Get off my box.
[6532.30s -> 6532.78s]  Get out the way.
[6532.78s -> 6533.18s]  I got this.
[6533.18s -> 6533.98s]  I'm going to solo it.
[6534.70s -> 6534.86s]  All right.
[6534.86s -> 6535.58s]  Let him solo it.
[6535.58s -> 6535.90s]  All right.
[6536.94s -> 6538.78s]  Let him do his thing that he wants to do so bad.
[6541.07s -> 6541.47s]  All right.
[6541.47s -> 6542.11s]  Cool.
[6542.11s -> 6542.35s]  Nice.
[6543.47s -> 6546.86s]  That would sound like.
[6548.06s -> 6549.50s]  Yeah.
[6550.14s -> 6550.62s]  All right.
[6550.62s -> 6550.94s]  Call.
[6553.18s -> 6555.18s]  I don't I don't remember sounding, but all right.
[6557.56s -> 6558.76s]  Miss the collectible.
[6558.76s -> 6559.24s]  All right.
[6559.24s -> 6560.20s]  Did you miss the collection?
[6560.20s -> 6561.64s]  Did you really get up there?
[6561.64s -> 6563.24s]  You cared so much about your ego
[6563.24s -> 6564.44s]  and how good you are at video games
[6564.44s -> 6565.48s]  that you didn't get the collectible.
[6565.48s -> 6567.80s]  I just want to feel like my character can do something.
[6568.68s -> 6570.20s]  You know, not something.
[6570.20s -> 6571.96s]  I feel like when they designed to try
[6571.96s -> 6573.72s]  and they knew I was going to be the wizard
[6573.72s -> 6575.00s]  and they wanted me to feel bad.
[6579.61s -> 6582.36s]  Had a phobia for driving and getting through this garden.
[6582.36s -> 6584.28s]  German's more of a Patrick than a Squidward.
[6586.52s -> 6588.04s]  I would say star is a Squidward.
[6588.84s -> 6590.57s]  Let's stop talking about this.
[6590.57s -> 6593.37s]  Yeah, I'll agree with them.
[6593.37s -> 6595.61s]  Then we really shouldn't be adding any arrows into this.
[6595.61s -> 6596.41s]  I want to be Mr.
[6596.41s -> 6596.73s]  Fred's.
[6597.69s -> 6601.13s]  Maybe we'll be lucky and there'll be no other monsters to contend with.
[6601.13s -> 6602.57s]  Amadeus is hopeful.
[6602.57s -> 6603.69s]  Optimism was.
[6606.17s -> 6607.53s]  It's the one doing nothing.
[6607.53s -> 6609.05s]  Ban that guy instantly.
[6609.05s -> 6609.37s]  Come on.
[6610.65s -> 6611.37s]  Where are my muds?
[6614.49s -> 6616.09s]  He dropped like a rope or something.
[6618.04s -> 6619.16s]  What do you need help?
[6619.16s -> 6620.52s]  All of a sudden you need help?
[6620.52s -> 6621.40s]  No, I don't.
[6621.40s -> 6622.28s]  I don't need any help.
[6625.68s -> 6626.80s]  Jerm is the one who needs help.
[6627.76s -> 6629.04s]  I was up top the whole time.
[6629.04s -> 6629.68s]  No, I don't.
[6629.68s -> 6630.32s]  No, I don't.
[6630.32s -> 6631.36s]  He doesn't need help.
[6631.36s -> 6631.84s]  I don't.
[6631.84s -> 6632.08s]  No.
[6636.44s -> 6636.76s]  I don't.
[6636.76s -> 6637.72s]  I just stay there.
[6643.69s -> 6644.49s]  Spongebob do this.
[6647.26s -> 6647.98s]  All right, let's go.
[6649.74s -> 6651.10s]  Spongebob kind of does do that,
[6651.10s -> 6653.02s]  but except instead of pounding, it goes.
[6654.72s -> 6655.92s]  Hey guys, remember this?
[6658.36s -> 6659.72s]  Here, you stand on my box.
[6660.44s -> 6660.84s]  Run up.
[6661.56s -> 6666.36s]  Does that even work?
[6668.38s -> 6668.86s]  I jump.
[6671.04s -> 6671.36s]  Hold on.
[6671.36s -> 6671.92s]  Okay.
[6671.92s -> 6672.32s]  You have...
[6672.32s -> 6672.64s]  Okay.
[6672.64s -> 6673.52s]  You jump and...
[6674.08s -> 6675.36s]  Everyone hated that.
[6675.36s -> 6676.80s]  Jerma has to shoot Jerma.
[6676.80s -> 6677.30s]  Stop.
[6678.84s -> 6679.72s]  Ashley, go to the left.
[6680.36s -> 6681.52s]  All right.
[6681.52s -> 6682.56s]  I mean, that one worked.
[6683.44s -> 6684.40s]  I have to freeze it.
[6684.40s -> 6684.80s]  I know.
[6685.92s -> 6687.16s]  All right.
[6687.16s -> 6688.44s]  And then I shoot a normal one.
[6688.44s -> 6689.72s]  Jerma could just freeze all of them.
[6690.36s -> 6691.40s]  Just not hold it up there.
[6691.40s -> 6691.88s]  Watch this.
[6693.23s -> 6693.63s]  Okay.
[6693.63s -> 6694.27s]  Never mind.
[6694.27s -> 6695.55s]  Jerma does the whole puzzle.
[6696.88s -> 6699.12s]  Yeah, nice character trying for...
[6702.84s -> 6704.44s]  Oh no, there's a combat sequence.
[6704.44s -> 6706.92s]  I wonder if Starb will kill everything in less than 10 seconds.
[6708.44s -> 6710.64s]  Should I even fight?
[6711.36s -> 6714.99s]  You know, that goes both ways, right?
[6716.30s -> 6717.18s]  You can freeze them.
[6717.18s -> 6718.38s]  I don't want to hear shit from you.
[6720.06s -> 6720.94s]  We missed a secret.
[6725.05s -> 6725.69s]  Over this way.
[6726.25s -> 6727.77s]  Or something.
[6727.77s -> 6728.17s]  Where is it?
[6729.56s -> 6730.92s]  Are you listening to your chat right now?
[6730.92s -> 6731.56s]  And you're making out?
[6731.56s -> 6732.12s]  No, no, no.
[6732.12s -> 6732.44s]  Look, look.
[6732.44s -> 6733.16s]  It's right here.
[6733.16s -> 6733.88s]  Is it up?
[6733.88s -> 6734.68s]  It's up.
[6734.68s -> 6735.16s]  There is.
[6737.16s -> 6744.44s]  Coming, big boy.
[6744.68s -> 6748.60s]  Thank you to Squirds for the five community subs.
[6748.60s -> 6749.24s]  Thank you, Squirds.
[6750.20s -> 6750.68s]  Appreciate it.
[6751.64s -> 6754.17s]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[6755.63s -> 6756.83s]  Congratulations to those who got it.
[6758.01s -> 6758.41s]  I'm up.
[6761.04s -> 6762.24s]  There's so much blood in here.
[6762.88s -> 6763.85s]  But we need you guys...
[6765.60s -> 6766.72s]  Well, at least I need Jerma.
[6767.28s -> 6767.68s]  You need me?
[6767.68s -> 6768.80s]  I don't know about Steve.
[6768.80s -> 6769.04s]  Yeah.
[6770.56s -> 6772.67s]  Thanks for the boost.
[6773.31s -> 6773.55s]  Hey.
[6774.43s -> 6778.24s]  Okay, what's up here?
[6778.24s -> 6779.20s]  Ooh, one of these things.
[6780.54s -> 6781.74s]  I think I can give you a bridge.
[6782.54s -> 6784.24s]  That'd be cool, wouldn't it?
[6784.96s -> 6787.02s]  Can I do that?
[6787.02s -> 6787.50s]  Yeah, I can.
[6789.02s -> 6790.99s]  And there's a treasure in here.
[6795.31s -> 6796.91s]  That's cool how you guys needed me.
[6796.91s -> 6799.39s]  Well, you are turning into like the third wheel here instead.
[6799.39s -> 6800.27s]  Can I get some more water?
[6801.39s -> 6801.63s]  Yeah.
[6802.88s -> 6803.36s]  Happy.
[6804.24s -> 6807.08s]  Also, can I see a drink menu when you get a chance?
[6807.80s -> 6808.73s]  Oh, yeah.
[6814.97s -> 6817.95s]  Today our special is lemonade.
[6821.55s -> 6823.23s]  What a shitty restaurant.
[6824.75s -> 6825.79s]  Oh, okay.
[6825.79s -> 6827.07s]  You have lemonade today.
[6828.73s -> 6831.16s]  Now?
[6831.16s -> 6832.04s]  It's poisoned.
[6837.10s -> 6838.84s]  Oh, I got you, Ashley.
[6845.90s -> 6847.50s]  Today's special, bread.
[6849.58s -> 6852.06s]  Our special, bread and lemonade.
[6853.66s -> 6856.17s]  What is that?
[6857.13s -> 6860.25s]  Our dessert menu, we have a bag of Oreos.
[6860.25s -> 6861.13s]  Is this prison?
[6863.40s -> 6864.92s]  Is this a prison restaurant?
[6865.64s -> 6871.32s]  Would it be cool if the two of you went to prison together?
[6871.32s -> 6871.72s]  It would.
[6871.72s -> 6872.84s]  We should film that video.
[6872.84s -> 6875.56s]  No, they've made movies about that kind of shit before.
[6875.56s -> 6876.44s]  But not with us.
[6877.64s -> 6879.48s]  Yeah, but it would be the same movie.
[6881.47s -> 6881.95s]  But better.
[6882.59s -> 6885.92s]  Well, two guys, two guys are unprepared for prison.
[6885.92s -> 6886.80s]  Go to prison.
[6886.80s -> 6888.48s]  And whoa, I wasn't ready for this.
[6889.82s -> 6890.70s]  Nobody's gonna read that.
[6892.30s -> 6892.86s]  My mistake.
[6892.86s -> 6906.09s]  I think this is a boss coming up.
[6907.48s -> 6908.36s]  Oh, oh, mechanic.
[6922.57s -> 6923.13s]  Oh, cool.
[6924.17s -> 6924.81s]  I'll just wait.
[6927.21s -> 6927.85s]  You got to charge.
[6932.65s -> 6934.73s]  Oh, you have to charge at this thing.
[6934.73s -> 6935.05s]  Okay.
[6935.05s -> 6936.33s]  That was fucking cool.
[6937.13s -> 6937.45s]  Whoa.
[6938.33s -> 6939.53s]  I get a super arrow now.
[6940.17s -> 6940.81s]  You guys.
[6940.81s -> 6941.77s]  This looks so.
[6941.77s -> 6942.49s]  Oh, my God.
[6942.49s -> 6944.09s]  You guys are doing such cool things.
[6946.41s -> 6948.97s]  Wait, do you need a box?
[6948.97s -> 6950.09s]  I need someone to go in there.
[6957.10s -> 6959.90s]  Do we need a box right now?
[6960.78s -> 6961.02s]  Yeah.
[6962.30s -> 6963.98s]  My salmon was fucking cold.
[6966.80s -> 6967.20s]  Salmon.
[6967.20s -> 6968.16s]  We don't serve salmon.
[6969.52s -> 6970.80s]  You have to freeze the water there.
[6971.76s -> 6972.32s]  Freeze gun.
[6972.32s -> 6973.12s]  Did I bring this?
[6974.16s -> 6975.28s]  Is that why it's cold?
[6975.28s -> 6975.92s]  Was this in the car?
[6976.96s -> 6983.55s]  I just love it when you start role playing out of nowhere.
[6984.19s -> 6992.17s]  Imagine going to a fucking restaurant and like bringing like a whole plate of dinner,
[6992.17s -> 6995.93s]  like salmon, like a whole, you bring, you bring this in and it's like freezing cold
[6995.93s -> 6997.77s]  and you set it up there and like, excuse me.
[6997.77s -> 6998.65s]  Ashley, come back here.
[6999.53s -> 7002.57s]  I don't want to bother you anything, but like this is freezing fucking cold.
[7002.57s -> 7002.97s]  Touch it.
[7010.54s -> 7012.38s]  Sir, we don't have salmon on the menu.
[7012.38s -> 7017.26s]  What do you do?
[7019.10s -> 7021.10s]  That's when you say, yeah, it's, oh, it's cool.
[7021.10s -> 7021.34s]  Oh yeah.
[7021.34s -> 7022.38s]  Cause I, it was in my car.
[7023.74s -> 7024.46s]  I'm sorry.
[7024.46s -> 7025.26s]  Can I get the check?
[7027.02s -> 7027.34s]  Yeah.
[7027.34s -> 7028.38s]  You haven't ordered anything.
[7029.18s -> 7030.48s]  That's all right.
[7030.48s -> 7031.20s]  Can I still get one?
[7032.00s -> 7038.51s]  I kind of need to prove that I was here just in case I did an alibi.
[7040.91s -> 7041.55s]  She has a blink.
[7041.55s -> 7042.51s]  Hey, do you need a box?
[7042.51s -> 7042.91s]  Oh no.
[7047.08s -> 7048.70s]  All right.
[7049.18s -> 7053.58s]  Anything under here might need a box here.
[7055.00s -> 7055.96s]  Oh, one head twirl.
[7056.68s -> 7057.72s]  How come I can't grab that?
[7057.72s -> 7060.84s]  Oh, wait, did we go up there already?
[7061.96s -> 7062.44s]  Throw me up.
[7064.64s -> 7065.20s]  Sorry, sir.
[7065.20s -> 7066.96s]  We don't validate alibis here.
[7073.02s -> 7076.78s]  Well, there's a big, there's a big like 12% tip for you.
[7078.91s -> 7080.75s]  No, no, no, no, right here.
[7084.19s -> 7088.76s]  No, please respect that box guy.
[7088.76s -> 7090.36s]  I need to freeze that.
[7090.36s -> 7093.64s]  I respect it, but can you please put it where I can freeze it in a good spot?
[7094.20s -> 7095.16s]  Thank you.
[7095.16s -> 7096.52s]  Put it in a spot where I can freeze this.
[7096.52s -> 7098.92s]  She can, she can fucking air dash.
[7098.92s -> 7101.48s]  Yes, but let me like flex on you too.
[7102.84s -> 7104.36s]  I can't, I can't put it anywhere else.
[7104.36s -> 7105.40s]  I'm useless now.
[7105.40s -> 7106.76s]  What is you freezing this going to do?
[7107.72s -> 7108.60s]  I still made it.
[7108.60s -> 7109.56s]  I still made it.
[7111.64s -> 7112.04s]  Help.
[7112.04s -> 7113.16s]  What are you going to do for you though?
[7113.80s -> 7114.20s]  Help.
[7115.95s -> 7116.27s]  Here.
[7117.63s -> 7119.66s]  Oh, thanks, journal.
[7119.66s -> 7120.38s]  You did it again.
[7121.02s -> 7121.76s]  You got it.
[7122.46s -> 7123.58s]  I just pulled it.
[7123.58s -> 7124.22s]  Did you not get it?
[7124.22s -> 7125.02s]  Keep pulling.
[7125.02s -> 7125.98s]  Oh, there we go.
[7126.70s -> 7128.41s]  Oh, there's things up here.
[7128.41s -> 7131.45s]  You guys, you're going so fast because your characters are so powerful.
[7131.45s -> 7133.21s]  You missed the secrets.
[7133.21s -> 7136.17s]  So wait, is this, is this a case of they nerfed the wizard so much
[7136.17s -> 7137.69s]  because they were afraid of how powerful he was
[7137.69s -> 7139.61s]  to now the wizard's not really that great anymore?
[7140.51s -> 7143.87s]  I think the next level, I get my ability, but I'm just being,
[7143.87s -> 7145.39s]  I'm being dramatic until then.
[7145.39s -> 7148.35s]  Are you, is there anything else up there?
[7149.31s -> 7150.43s]  Yeah, there's a big one up there.
[7150.43s -> 7151.15s]  Oh, it's a big one.
[7152.43s -> 7153.31s]  Big fatty.
[7153.31s -> 7153.95s]  Yeah.
[7153.95s -> 7154.19s]  No.
[7154.83s -> 7155.39s]  Give me a boost.
[7160.57s -> 7162.41s]  I didn't need it for the record.
[7162.41s -> 7162.81s]  You get it?
[7162.81s -> 7163.45s]  Okay.
[7163.45s -> 7164.09s]  Yeah.
[7164.09s -> 7164.41s]  Nice.
[7167.98s -> 7169.98s]  I'll just, just wait until there's some combat.
[7172.52s -> 7173.64s]  Oh, and then we'll use that.
[7176.03s -> 7176.43s]  Oh, wait.
[7176.43s -> 7176.91s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7179.10s -> 7180.52s]  But you're blocking it.
[7180.52s -> 7181.16s]  There's a box in the way.
[7182.44s -> 7185.00s]  Oh, we need to think about this one.
[7189.02s -> 7189.34s]  I think.
[7189.98s -> 7191.02s]  We need your point.
[7191.02s -> 7191.26s]  No.
[7191.26s -> 7191.98s]  Somebody can stand on it.
[7191.98s -> 7193.34s]  I can stick my box under it.
[7193.34s -> 7194.30s]  No, somebody can just stand on it.
[7195.50s -> 7196.30s]  Yeah, and then put it under.
[7196.94s -> 7198.67s]  There we go.
[7198.67s -> 7198.99s]  See?
[7198.99s -> 7200.43s]  Box guy, box guy.
[7200.43s -> 7201.63s]  Here comes box guy.
[7212.64s -> 7213.36s]  Can I freeze that?
[7214.64s -> 7215.96s]  Let me see.
[7215.96s -> 7219.64s]  It's like the Mario level with all the invisible blocks that show up in the first spot.
[7219.64s -> 7220.84s]  I'm the kaizo block.
[7221.96s -> 7223.08s]  Oh, I can freeze that.
[7223.08s -> 7223.32s]  Okay.
[7224.60s -> 7225.64s]  Lift me up?
[7225.64s -> 7226.04s]  Hold on.
[7227.64s -> 7228.44s]  Push it up like high.
[7229.08s -> 7232.64s]  And then, yeah, now I'll freeze it.
[7232.64s -> 7234.08s]  Can you lift this or do, do I?
[7235.20s -> 7235.60s]  Is that enough?
[7235.60s -> 7240.86s]  I can if someone wasn't standing on it, but someone keeps standing on it.
[7240.86s -> 7243.10s]  I can get over there at the back of the line.
[7243.10s -> 7243.82s]  Give it a good lift.
[7244.62s -> 7244.94s]  Lift.
[7246.14s -> 7247.02s]  There you go.
[7247.02s -> 7247.34s]  See?
[7248.22s -> 7249.98s]  No doubt.
[7250.62s -> 7254.83s]  I mean, we were trying to freeze it and then we can get up and the whole teamwork thing.
[7255.95s -> 7259.79s]  You might, you might feel like you don't need the wizard anymore, but I need you.
[7261.47s -> 7264.27s]  The wizard.
[7266.09s -> 7268.84s]  Oh, oh, oh, okay.
[7268.84s -> 7269.96s]  There's a bunch of stuff up here.
[7270.68s -> 7272.44s]  There's a whole nother way to go.
[7272.44s -> 7273.24s]  What the hell is this?
[7274.28s -> 7275.88s]  But wait, get it.
[7276.76s -> 7277.08s]  Got him.
[7277.08s -> 7277.64s]  What's going on?
[7282.19s -> 7284.11s]  I'm not entirely sure what's going on over there.
[7284.11s -> 7285.23s]  Maybe you, I think we need to break this.
[7286.27s -> 7287.21s]  Come on, Steve.
[7287.21s -> 7287.45s]  You good?
[7288.65s -> 7289.29s]  Yeah.
[7289.29s -> 7292.84s]  So what do we do about this?
[7292.84s -> 7296.68s]  You got to get the rock from the top right and then Ashley has to smash it at the wall.
[7298.52s -> 7300.43s]  Watch out, I'm going to smash.
[7302.75s -> 7303.47s]  Smash.
[7303.47s -> 7304.83s]  You got to smash it upwards.
[7304.83s -> 7305.23s]  Get out.
[7307.21s -> 7308.89s]  Look, you need the, you don't need my ability.
[7308.89s -> 7310.81s]  But you need me to tell you that you're wrong.
[7310.81s -> 7311.93s]  Tell a joke or riot.
[7313.13s -> 7314.36s]  Oh, well, whatever.
[7322.28s -> 7323.40s]  Need a box.
[7323.40s -> 7324.04s]  I need a box.
[7329.82s -> 7330.70s]  No squad stream.
[7330.70s -> 7332.86s]  Yeah, that's because Jerma doesn't want it.
[7332.86s -> 7335.76s]  He's sick of, he's sick of sharing viewers.
[7335.76s -> 7337.28s]  He said it's not fair.
[7338.72s -> 7339.44s]  He's not fair.
[7339.44s -> 7341.44s]  You're just going to leech off me every time.
[7341.44s -> 7342.96s]  So he said he didn't want to do it anymore.
[7343.52s -> 7345.76s]  This is absolutely untrue.
[7346.88s -> 7348.96s]  This is total fabrication.
[7349.36s -> 7350.72s]  I got to defend myself here.
[7353.02s -> 7355.74s]  Jerma won't even talk to anyone unless you have a stream.
[7355.74s -> 7357.10s]  I can't, I can't smash the guy.
[7357.10s -> 7358.30s]  He's got box blockers.
[7360.16s -> 7360.48s]  Kill him.
[7360.48s -> 7361.04s]  I froze him.
[7361.76s -> 7364.52s]  Star, drop your box on his head.
[7364.52s -> 7366.52s]  I can't, those walls block the box.
[7373.90s -> 7381.18s]  By the way, a squad stream on this game would be you opening three tabs of the same stream.
[7381.82s -> 7383.50s]  Let's just be clear on that.
[7383.50s -> 7385.50s]  Yeah, you have to, I have to bring this rock up top.
[7389.39s -> 7390.96s]  Can you freeze it?
[7392.08s -> 7392.64s]  Oh, sorry.
[7393.60s -> 7394.24s]  I froze it.
[7395.96s -> 7396.46s]  Yeah.
[7399.24s -> 7400.60s]  You hear that in this song?
[7402.52s -> 7403.24s]  Is it doing that?
[7404.54s -> 7405.82s]  It's the ding fries are done.
[7408.48s -> 7409.52s]  Ding, what are you talking about?
[7410.56s -> 7412.32s]  Can I freeze the water coming out of there?
[7412.32s -> 7414.08s]  I actually don't know what that sound normally is.
[7415.20s -> 7416.32s]  All right, I've got that frozen.
[7417.20s -> 7420.32s]  And now bounce the water from here into the, into the wheel.
[7421.76s -> 7422.48s]  I did that already.
[7423.44s -> 7425.52s]  What about the up, the up wheel, the wheel up there?
[7427.34s -> 7429.02s]  Oh, what about the up wheel?
[7431.16s -> 7432.59s]  How do we get the wheel?
[7432.59s -> 7433.47s]  How do we get the up wheel?
[7434.11s -> 7442.16s]  What's up wheel?
[7444.80s -> 7445.92s]  Okay, then freeze that.
[7447.04s -> 7447.68s]  And now.
[7447.68s -> 7448.24s]  Oh, okay.
[7448.24s -> 7448.80s]  Hold on.
[7448.80s -> 7449.20s]  Sorry.
[7449.20s -> 7452.72s]  If someone's going to talk shit about me now, stir confirmed family guy reference.
[7452.72s -> 7454.72s]  That was like an e-bombs world.
[7455.84s -> 7456.72s]  Joke, meme.
[7456.72s -> 7457.52s]  Is this going to work?
[7458.64s -> 7459.28s]  How do we do this?
[7460.16s -> 7462.25s]  Oh, you know, okay.
[7462.25s -> 7463.37s]  It kind of did for a second.
[7464.17s -> 7465.05s]  Oh my God, that worked.
[7468.64s -> 7469.44s]  As intended.
[7469.44s -> 7474.48s]  Star, what's, what the fuck is Spider-Man's name?
[7474.48s -> 7476.40s]  A fucking, what the fuck?
[7476.40s -> 7477.44s]  Why can I not think of this name?
[7477.44s -> 7479.44s]  Oh, Parkle, Parkle Pepper.
[7479.44s -> 7480.32s]  No, no, no.
[7480.32s -> 7480.88s]  Peter Pickle.
[7481.44s -> 7481.76s]  What is it?
[7481.76s -> 7482.64s]  What's the first one?
[7482.64s -> 7484.00s]  Peter Parker picked the pepper.
[7484.00s -> 7485.60s]  Oh, fucking family guy over here.
[7485.60s -> 7486.40s]  Fucking Peter.
[7486.40s -> 7486.90s]  Nice.
[7487.52s -> 7488.96s]  Oh, people, people, Peter.
[7490.08s -> 7495.34s]  I got him to say it.
[7495.34s -> 7497.26s]  Now you can, you guys can take that.
[7497.98s -> 7500.62s]  You guys can clip that one second that he did it.
[7504.48s -> 7505.04s]  Well, there you go.
[7505.04s -> 7505.84s]  Now he said it for real.
[7506.64s -> 7510.01s]  Who's your favorite family guy character, Steve?
[7510.81s -> 7512.40s]  Who do you identify with?
[7513.20s -> 7517.20s]  If you're going to like clip me and put me in like the German green screen videos,
[7517.20s -> 7520.88s]  just have me show up real fast and say, anybody need a box?
[7520.88s -> 7522.00s]  I need to skip jump.
[7524.03s -> 7524.53s]  Nope.
[7529.23s -> 7529.71s]  No, stop it.
[7529.71s -> 7530.67s]  I can, I can do this.
[7532.97s -> 7535.05s]  Oh, stop participating.
[7535.05s -> 7535.55s]  Okay.
[7536.25s -> 7536.65s]  All right.
[7536.65s -> 7537.85s]  This game is on you now.
[7540.78s -> 7541.34s]  Can you get up?
[7541.34s -> 7542.30s]  I'll wait till I meet it.
[7542.30s -> 7542.80s]  Okay, good.
[7546.27s -> 7547.23s]  Ego maniac.
[7551.13s -> 7551.45s]  There you go.
[7551.45s -> 7552.33s]  It's safe.
[7552.33s -> 7553.85s]  What's your favorite family guy character?
[7557.77s -> 7558.41s]  Adam West.
[7559.61s -> 7561.13s]  Hey, there's a whole thing up here, guys.
[7561.13s -> 7562.49s]  Are we doing the thing still?
[7562.49s -> 7563.45s]  We're doing a top left.
[7563.45s -> 7564.73s]  Come up here and do the thing or?
[7564.97s -> 7571.18s]  Oh, it's kind of high up there.
[7571.18s -> 7572.30s]  How am I supposed to make it up?
[7573.34s -> 7574.54s]  You need help?
[7574.54s -> 7575.50s]  I think I can grab it.
[7576.46s -> 7576.96s]  Nope.
[7582.41s -> 7582.97s]  It's just Adam.
[7582.97s -> 7585.37s]  It's Adam West because Adam West was just cool.
[7585.37s -> 7587.21s]  Like, is it?
[7587.21s -> 7588.41s]  He was a Batman.
[7588.41s -> 7588.91s]  He was.
[7589.93s -> 7591.85s]  Some would argue he was the best Batman.
[7593.08s -> 7593.32s]  All right.
[7593.32s -> 7594.44s]  I can freeze that.
[7594.44s -> 7595.72s]  So, but that doesn't help.
[7597.55s -> 7598.27s]  Wait, maybe we should free.
[7598.27s -> 7599.71s]  I should freeze this one.
[7600.27s -> 7600.83s]  Check this out.
[7601.55s -> 7602.35s]  Freeze that one.
[7604.00s -> 7604.40s]  And then.
[7605.90s -> 7606.38s]  Never mind.
[7607.02s -> 7610.06s]  Freeze this one because I can only freeze one thing at a time.
[7610.06s -> 7611.98s]  Now unfreeze the other one because we're in.
[7611.98s -> 7612.70s]  You're in.
[7612.70s -> 7613.42s]  Unfreeze the wheel.
[7615.98s -> 7616.70s]  You're in.
[7616.70s -> 7617.42s]  Then freeze the wheel.
[7618.91s -> 7619.63s]  And then get up there.
[7621.37s -> 7622.09s]  And then do it again.
[7622.09s -> 7622.65s]  And then do it again.
[7623.37s -> 7623.93s]  And then do it.
[7623.93s -> 7624.49s]  Then do it again.
[7626.49s -> 7627.21s]  Then do it again.
[7628.09s -> 7629.95s]  And I'll do it again.
[7635.08s -> 7637.24s]  Oh, all right.
[7638.36s -> 7640.44s]  Wait, but now you're stuck in there.
[7641.40s -> 7642.14s]  Shit.
[7642.14s -> 7643.02s]  No, wait.
[7643.02s -> 7643.82s]  Do the bottom one.
[7643.82s -> 7644.62s]  Bottom one's easier.
[7645.18s -> 7645.42s]  All right.
[7645.42s -> 7646.54s]  I'm going to shift out of here.
[7647.34s -> 7647.66s]  Do it.
[7649.45s -> 7649.77s]  Do it.
[7650.41s -> 7650.73s]  Yeah.
[7654.72s -> 7655.68s]  I missed the chest.
[7655.68s -> 7656.64s]  I got the chest.
[7656.64s -> 7657.04s]  You did?
[7658.24s -> 7658.72s]  Yeah.
[7658.72s -> 7659.76s]  The whole thing showed up.
[7659.76s -> 7660.00s]  Chat.
[7660.00s -> 7660.56s]  Oh, you got it.
[7660.56s -> 7662.00s]  I'm banning like seven people right now.
[7662.00s -> 7662.32s]  Hold on.
[7662.32s -> 7663.92s]  They're all fucking gone for good.
[7666.33s -> 7667.69s]  And while you're not in my chat anymore,
[7667.69s -> 7669.05s]  do me a favor and look for those emails.
[7669.69s -> 7672.33s]  How many permanent bans have you given out on your channel, do you think?
[7674.17s -> 7674.41s]  Ow.
[7675.05s -> 7675.92s]  Uh-oh.
[7677.02s -> 7677.50s]  I don't know.
[7677.50s -> 7678.14s]  They're all gone now.
[7678.14s -> 7678.86s]  I removed them all.
[7679.82s -> 7680.06s]  All right.
[7680.06s -> 7682.62s]  So we got, what do we got here?
[7683.26s -> 7686.80s]  We have water, which, okay.
[7687.52s -> 7689.60s]  I tried to grab the thing, but it didn't work.
[7691.34s -> 7692.14s]  So if I do this.
[7692.94s -> 7694.22s]  No, I'm trying to stop it.
[7697.36s -> 7699.52s]  I need to attach this to that.
[7699.52s -> 7699.84s]  Okay.
[7699.84s -> 7701.04s]  I see what you're doing.
[7701.04s -> 7703.18s]  All right.
[7703.18s -> 7703.90s]  You need to, hmm.
[7711.53s -> 7712.65s]  Maybe, actually.
[7713.53s -> 7716.72s]  We need to bounce the water.
[7717.52s -> 7720.56s]  I have to free something here for Ashley to stand on.
[7721.90s -> 7724.06s]  I think, I think I know what needs to happen.
[7726.17s -> 7729.77s]  I think you might actually need to have to do a loop around with your rope
[7729.77s -> 7731.53s]  to make the water come down the rope.
[7733.13s -> 7737.98s]  No, I don't think so.
[7739.44s -> 7739.76s]  Oh, wait.
[7739.76s -> 7740.48s]  Or Ashley.
[7740.48s -> 7742.64s]  You can get into there.
[7742.64s -> 7742.88s]  Okay.
[7742.88s -> 7743.04s]  Yeah.
[7743.04s -> 7744.80s]  You just have to, you could probably, yeah.
[7744.80s -> 7745.76s]  Now you just bounce it up there.
[7746.48s -> 7751.15s]  It didn't open the gate or anything.
[7751.15s -> 7753.31s]  Well, no, I put the box back there and then turn this way.
[7753.31s -> 7754.43s]  Oh, the wheels above.
[7754.43s -> 7754.59s]  Yeah.
[7754.59s -> 7756.83s]  The wheels above you that have the water go shoot up.
[7757.47s -> 7759.05s]  Yeah.
[7759.05s -> 7762.92s]  Or if you have Ashley just bounce it up from there straight up.
[7763.64s -> 7764.76s]  Are you muted, Ashley?
[7765.56s -> 7766.60s]  Yeah, I was.
[7766.60s -> 7768.68s]  Not quite far enough, but hold on.
[7768.68s -> 7769.32s]  I can do this.
[7770.12s -> 7771.02s]  Is it going to work?
[7771.98s -> 7772.94s]  It worked last time.
[7773.66s -> 7777.68s]  Come on.
[7777.68s -> 7779.76s]  Can you bring this box in here so she can stand on it?
[7781.20s -> 7781.44s]  Yeah.
[7783.08s -> 7783.40s]  What?
[7783.40s -> 7783.88s]  Why?
[7783.88s -> 7784.60s]  No, I can't.
[7786.62s -> 7786.94s]  Look at this.
[7786.94s -> 7787.82s]  The box denied.
[7788.46s -> 7790.46s]  I'm trying to think of what, hmm.
[7790.46s -> 7794.72s]  It's like bouncing the same droplet over here.
[7799.76s -> 7800.16s]  Distract.
[7800.16s -> 7800.40s]  Yeah.
[7800.40s -> 7803.04s]  Can you stand on the box?
[7803.04s -> 7803.52s]  No.
[7803.52s -> 7804.80s]  Can, can she stand on the box?
[7805.98s -> 7806.86s]  Not while he's holding it.
[7806.86s -> 7807.66s]  Not while you're holding it.
[7816.70s -> 7817.98s]  Can you just do it?
[7818.70s -> 7819.26s]  Just hold on.
[7820.46s -> 7821.10s]  Just keep, keep it.
[7821.10s -> 7821.82s]  No, no, no.
[7821.82s -> 7825.37s]  Keep it like, um, tilted.
[7825.37s -> 7826.01s]  Yeah.
[7826.01s -> 7826.97s]  You just had it for a second.
[7831.76s -> 7832.72s]  You guys, it's physics.
[7835.71s -> 7836.91s]  Get wet, Will.
[7836.91s -> 7837.39s]  For what?
[7837.39s -> 7840.06s]  I don't, I don't get it.
[7840.86s -> 7844.38s]  And then your rope doesn't do it.
[7846.43s -> 7848.96s]  Now, I don't know.
[7848.96s -> 7850.88s]  Put the box down here and I'll stand on it.
[7855.76s -> 7856.24s]  There it is.
[7857.04s -> 7857.36s]  Kind of.
[7860.89s -> 7863.93s]  Oh, that's strong enough.
[7863.93s -> 7864.89s]  As intended.
[7866.36s -> 7866.84s]  Almost.
[7874.27s -> 7875.15s]  I don't think so.
[7875.95s -> 7876.91s]  Unless it's like this.
[7877.55s -> 7880.91s]  What if you freeze that where it's coming out of?
[7880.91s -> 7882.51s]  Will it come out of the other pipe or something?
[7882.51s -> 7882.99s]  I don't know.
[7882.99s -> 7883.55s]  There's some weird-
[7883.55s -> 7884.27s]  No, no!
[7885.63s -> 7886.03s]  Sorry.
[7887.76s -> 7888.00s]  No.
[7889.10s -> 7889.98s]  I just froze that.
[7890.86s -> 7892.96s]  Wait, shoot ice about again?
[7893.76s -> 7894.16s]  Wait a minute.
[7894.16s -> 7894.48s]  Hold on.
[7895.36s -> 7896.32s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7896.32s -> 7896.80s]  Wait a second.
[7897.52s -> 7898.60s]  Give me the, give me the box.
[7898.60s -> 7899.48s]  Give me the box, give me the box.
[7899.48s -> 7900.92s]  Give me the box, give me the box.
[7900.92s -> 7902.60s]  No, you didn't have to do that too.
[7902.60s -> 7903.08s]  Give me the box.
[7903.08s -> 7903.64s]  Give me over there.
[7904.28s -> 7905.00s]  Give me the other side.
[7906.76s -> 7907.00s]  Okay.
[7907.72s -> 7909.00s]  Get, oh, fuck.
[7909.00s -> 7909.48s]  Do it again.
[7912.44s -> 7913.24s]  All right.
[7913.24s -> 7916.52s]  Now, now get, give me the box.
[7917.40s -> 7918.80s]  Hold on.
[7918.80s -> 7920.56s]  Wait, wait, I don't, no wait on here.
[7921.28s -> 7923.36s]  I need to like get, I need to put this on top.
[7924.48s -> 7925.28s]  No, stop.
[7925.28s -> 7926.56s]  Why did you do that?
[7927.52s -> 7927.84s]  What?
[7927.84s -> 7928.96s]  You wanted the box, right?
[7928.96s -> 7929.44s]  I need to.
[7929.44s -> 7929.68s]  Okay.
[7931.24s -> 7932.76s]  I thought you were going to attach it to my box.
[7933.40s -> 7933.88s]  Get up there.
[7940.25s -> 7940.49s]  Wow.
[7941.13s -> 7941.61s]  This guy.
[7942.97s -> 7943.45s]  This guy.
[7946.17s -> 7946.73s]  This guy.
[7948.76s -> 7949.32s]  This guy.
[7949.32s -> 7951.00s]  Who deserves a trophy?
[7951.00s -> 7951.48s]  Do I?
[7951.48s -> 7951.88s]  Take one.
[7952.84s -> 7962.96s]  I can't do it.
[7963.44s -> 7964.40s]  The ceiling's too low.
[7969.82s -> 7971.10s]  I'm not even like trying.
[7971.10s -> 7972.30s]  We have fight sequences.
[7972.30s -> 7972.78s]  I'm sorry.
[7973.90s -> 7975.02s]  Oh, he said it.
[7975.02s -> 7975.98s]  He said the name.
[7975.98s -> 7977.10s]  I'm not even trying.
[7978.86s -> 7979.34s]  There it is.
[7980.22s -> 7984.54s]  People have been like minus twoing my like shitty dad jokes this whole time.
[7985.50s -> 7986.06s]  Plus two.
[7986.06s -> 7986.94s]  Can we get plus two?
[7986.94s -> 7990.70s]  That's unbelievable that I'm even seeing even five plus twos for that.
[7992.06s -> 7995.82s]  That's unbelievable.
[7995.82s -> 8001.87s]  I'm ready to go in.
[8001.87s -> 8002.19s]  Okay.
[8002.19s -> 8008.08s]  Now I'm going to freeze this and let this go.
[8010.43s -> 8013.50s]  I'm prepared to enter the room.
[8017.31s -> 8018.11s]  I need a box.
[8018.11s -> 8019.79s]  We all had the same exact idea.
[8019.79s -> 8020.43s]  That's funny.
[8020.43s -> 8020.99s]  Jump on me.
[8021.63s -> 8022.35s]  I want to be the box.
[8023.87s -> 8024.19s]  Yes.
[8031.37s -> 8032.25s]  Is that a different?
[8032.25s -> 8033.13s]  That one's like yellow.
[8034.17s -> 8034.97s]  Why is this one yellow?
[8037.31s -> 8037.79s]  It is.
[8037.79s -> 8038.59s]  No, it's not.
[8038.59s -> 8039.39s]  Is it?
[8039.39s -> 8040.11s]  I got them all.
[8040.91s -> 8041.31s]  Let's go.
[8041.31s -> 8052.92s]  Let me attach this to that.
[8053.56s -> 8056.00s]  Is that the wrong way?
[8056.80s -> 8057.92s]  It's not turning.
[8057.92s -> 8059.04s]  I think it has to go up.
[8059.04s -> 8059.92s]  But hold on.
[8059.92s -> 8060.72s]  Can I spin this?
[8066.09s -> 8066.33s]  No.
[8066.89s -> 8069.72s]  Can I pull this?
[8069.72s -> 8070.68s]  I can't like pull this.
[8074.88s -> 8075.28s]  Hold on.
[8076.16s -> 8077.00s]  I mean, I'm...
[8078.28s -> 8079.08s]  You got it.
[8079.08s -> 8080.28s]  But we have to open the door.
[8080.28s -> 8080.92s]  The door is open.
[8082.12s -> 8084.32s]  Wait, should I?
[8084.32s -> 8084.80s]  What?
[8084.80s -> 8085.52s]  Okay.
[8085.52s -> 8086.02s]  Cool.
[8103.93s -> 8104.65s]  Is that too far?
[8104.65s -> 8104.89s]  Sorry.
[8113.23s -> 8115.47s]  Hey, you know how like I lift the box up for you
[8115.47s -> 8116.27s]  and then you go ahead?
[8116.27s -> 8116.99s]  Can you like...
[8116.99s -> 8118.43s]  Can you get used to roping them
[8118.43s -> 8119.71s]  and maybe helping a wizard out?
[8121.26s -> 8121.66s]  Maybe.
[8124.57s -> 8125.21s]  I need...
[8125.21s -> 8127.21s]  We need to like pull this over here.
[8127.21s -> 8132.73s]  All right.
[8132.73s -> 8133.13s]  Do it.
[8133.13s -> 8134.33s]  Lift it up.
[8134.33s -> 8134.89s]  You're on it.
[8134.89s -> 8135.21s]  I can't.
[8140.40s -> 8140.96s]  Can you get this?
[8143.05s -> 8143.37s]  Yep.
[8143.37s -> 8143.85s]  Here we go.
[8144.49s -> 8144.89s]  Thank you.
[8145.53s -> 8146.17s]  Mm-hmm.
[8146.17s -> 8147.71s]  We have to...
[8148.59s -> 8148.91s]  Yeah.
[8149.63s -> 8156.35s]  How are you here?
[8157.23s -> 8157.79s]  What?
[8157.79s -> 8158.86s]  I've been here.
[8159.66s -> 8160.46s]  I've been here.
[8161.66s -> 8165.72s]  All right.
[8165.72s -> 8166.68s]  Can I get a little bit of a pop?
[8167.32s -> 8169.74s]  Oh, you want a little bit of a pop?
[8169.74s -> 8170.22s]  Oh, you got...
[8170.22s -> 8170.62s]  Oh, you got...
[8170.62s -> 8171.90s]  Oh, she's the box.
[8171.90s -> 8172.70s]  I'm the box.
[8172.70s -> 8172.94s]  All right.
[8172.94s -> 8173.98s]  But then how do you get up here?
[8173.98s -> 8174.54s]  We need to help.
[8175.18s -> 8175.90s]  Oh, there you go.
[8177.44s -> 8178.08s]  Uh-oh.
[8178.08s -> 8178.40s]  Fighting.
[8178.40s -> 8179.20s]  This is my realm.
[8182.22s -> 8183.50s]  He shot my box out of the air.
[8184.30s -> 8184.62s]  That did?
[8186.04s -> 8187.32s]  He's anti-airing my box.
[8187.96s -> 8189.47s]  Well, now he's frozen.
[8190.03s -> 8190.75s]  Freeze.
[8190.75s -> 8191.39s]  Head box.
[8192.03s -> 8196.04s]  Oh, it's off the screen.
[8197.08s -> 8198.49s]  Sick.
[8199.21s -> 8199.45s]  No!
[8200.49s -> 8202.62s]  The platform is gone.
[8203.34s -> 8205.44s]  Yep.
[8206.40s -> 8208.00s]  I feel like there's something else up here.
[8208.00s -> 8210.94s]  Screenshot that and read it later.
[8210.94s -> 8212.86s]  Nope.
[8212.86s -> 8216.17s]  I think we should be reading other people's mail.
[8216.17s -> 8217.37s]  It's kind of weird.
[8217.37s -> 8218.57s]  It was mail for you.
[8219.61s -> 8222.97s]  But we got like this really important looking letter in the mail for somebody else.
[8224.01s -> 8225.13s]  We still haven't given it.
[8226.43s -> 8226.91s]  Oh, yeah.
[8227.95s -> 8229.32s]  It's like open immediately.
[8229.40s -> 8230.28s]  Why did that just happen?
[8230.28s -> 8233.16s]  That's actually a lawsuit letter sent to us for someone else.
[8234.12s -> 8235.32s]  Oh, my God.
[8235.32s -> 8235.56s]  All right.
[8235.56s -> 8235.80s]  There.
[8236.76s -> 8240.80s]  It's not my fault the postman doesn't understand what numbers are.
[8248.43s -> 8250.27s]  Isn't that the first thing you learn as a mailman?
[8251.47s -> 8253.23s]  This is a long ass level.
[8255.52s -> 8255.84s]  Right?
[8256.88s -> 8257.68s]  I can freeze that.
[8257.68s -> 8258.24s]  Pull it back up.
[8258.96s -> 8262.48s]  Put it in like a good spot.
[8272.19s -> 8275.71s]  Now I think we're good.
[8278.46s -> 8278.70s]  Nice.
[8278.70s -> 8280.06s]  I want that ability.
[8280.14s -> 8282.78s]  No, it looks like fun.
[8282.78s -> 8286.44s]  No smash.
[8286.44s -> 8293.24s]  Oh, I found a player to continue waiting for just waiting for the drops of virgin blood there.
[8294.04s -> 8294.68s]  What did you get?
[8295.48s -> 8296.36s]  That's actually a lot.
[8299.90s -> 8303.10s]  It must be upsetting to see what happened while you were away.
[8303.10s -> 8307.45s]  My nightmares ruin this castle.
[8307.45s -> 8310.97s]  It's why I was sent away and locked up in the dungeons of the Astral Academy.
[8311.77s -> 8315.10s]  Let's do them all.
[8315.74s -> 8316.54s]  You have the changer.
[8317.34s -> 8321.53s]  Oh, it's best you let me go.
[8322.25s -> 8324.51s]  Will you leave me behind?
[8325.39s -> 8325.87s]  That's me.
[8326.83s -> 8327.71s]  He said do them all.
[8327.71s -> 8328.35s]  I'm trying.
[8330.51s -> 8333.16s]  No, there's one way.
[8333.16s -> 8335.39s]  I just I give up.
[8336.41s -> 8344.52s]  Hey, breaking the gym.
[8344.52s -> 8350.64s]  Old reference skip skip skip.
[8350.64s -> 8351.14s]  Hey.
[8352.16s -> 8353.44s]  Oh, no.
[8353.44s -> 8354.24s]  Are we here again?
[8355.12s -> 8357.52s]  Tell me this is the whole game is one just long level.
[8358.96s -> 8360.16s]  We're in the dream world.
[8367.40s -> 8370.48s]  I was the only one not doing voices today.
[8374.83s -> 8375.31s]  Are you sure?
[8383.82s -> 8386.22s]  I can't actually just spit all of my screen.
[8388.78s -> 8401.21s]  No, it's so so impatient teleportation.
[8403.21s -> 8404.57s]  Ooh, that's cool.
[8404.57s -> 8405.07s]  Wow.
[8406.57s -> 8407.29s]  Cool.
[8407.29s -> 8410.64s]  Wait, this is where it gets a little weird.
[8417.42s -> 8417.92s]  You good?
[8418.30s -> 8419.62s]  I'm good.
[8420.65s -> 8422.09s]  Wow, the castle brand new.
[8422.09s -> 8424.33s]  It has all the old cobwebs back.
[8428.94s -> 8431.82s]  I stopped listening to everything he was saying like 40 minutes ago.
[8431.82s -> 8432.78s]  I don't know what he said.
[8433.74s -> 8440.16s]  You get out of my dream.
[8444.17s -> 8446.81s]  And he's just a Charlie Brown adult right now.
[8446.81s -> 8448.17s]  I don't I no idea what he's saying.
[8449.21s -> 8453.26s]  And me and Ashley.
[8454.14s -> 8456.67s]  I mean, actually, just do this puzzle.
[8457.31s -> 8458.27s]  So I'm going to freeze it.
[8459.15s -> 8461.12s]  Does that freeze?
[8461.92s -> 8463.98s]  What about down below?
[8468.99s -> 8470.19s]  The door doesn't stay open.
[8473.64s -> 8476.12s]  Here, we're going to get off of it.
[8476.12s -> 8476.84s]  You're muted again.
[8477.40s -> 8479.32s]  Can I freeze it when it's open or closed?
[8480.84s -> 8481.40s]  Yeah, you are.
[8483.00s -> 8483.88s]  There's a double mirror.
[8492.28s -> 8494.36s]  No, it's my box puzzle.
[8495.32s -> 8495.64s]  Fine.
[8495.64s -> 8496.76s]  It's your box.
[8497.48s -> 8499.88s]  I didn't need you something in the water.
[8501.16s -> 8501.66s]  Whoa.
[8505.15s -> 8506.83s]  Oh, don't touch the floor's lava.
[8506.83s -> 8507.63s]  The floor's lava.
[8507.63s -> 8507.95s]  It is.
[8507.95s -> 8508.91s]  I just proved it.
[8512.48s -> 8513.84s]  Oh, you got to pull this table.
[8514.48s -> 8516.46s]  What about those?
[8518.19s -> 8519.47s]  Oh, you want them?
[8519.47s -> 8519.97s]  Yeah.
[8523.24s -> 8523.74s]  Too far.
[8524.92s -> 8525.42s]  No.
[8526.04s -> 8529.08s]  OK, now I need something to attach this to in front of us.
[8531.08s -> 8532.52s]  Because then you're going to move it.
[8532.52s -> 8533.08s]  Check this out.
[8533.08s -> 8534.12s]  Now you're going to move it forward.
[8535.16s -> 8537.56s]  Oh, I thought that was going to be it.
[8538.62s -> 8540.38s]  I mean, hold on.
[8540.38s -> 8541.74s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[8543.34s -> 8545.74s]  Just connect it to the box, not the hook.
[8546.54s -> 8547.34s]  Unconnect hook.
[8547.90s -> 8549.90s]  OK.
[8549.90s -> 8550.86s]  Now connect the box.
[8551.58s -> 8553.34s]  Well, you said connect to the box.
[8553.34s -> 8553.98s]  Yeah, now connect.
[8554.94s -> 8555.44s]  OK.
[8557.28s -> 8558.72s]  You're trying to make a bridge with this.
[8558.72s -> 8560.08s]  Yeah, I'm trying to make a bridge.
[8560.08s -> 8561.60s]  OK, well, you go then move it forward.
[8562.40s -> 8563.52s]  Ashley's on top of it.
[8563.52s -> 8564.08s]  I can't.
[8564.08s -> 8564.88s]  I'm on the box.
[8564.88s -> 8566.08s]  You can't do it.
[8566.08s -> 8566.64s]  Hold on.
[8566.64s -> 8567.84s]  If I attach it to this, you...
[8568.72s -> 8570.08s]  What the fuck just happened there?
[8570.88s -> 8572.22s]  That's another box.
[8572.22s -> 8572.86s]  Yeah, OK, now.
[8574.14s -> 8575.34s]  Damn, we don't need any of this shit.
[8576.06s -> 8581.96s]  I just had a plan and you know what to work.
[8584.84s -> 8586.12s]  You shouldn't even need my box.
[8586.84s -> 8590.11s]  I need another weight.
[8590.75s -> 8591.55s]  No, that's fine.
[8593.92s -> 8594.72s]  Oh, fuck.
[8594.72s -> 8595.52s]  It didn't go all the way.
[8596.32s -> 8597.28s]  I already have that one iced,
[8597.84s -> 8600.64s]  but I guess I'll do this one instead.
[8601.36s -> 8603.88s]  Oh, shit.
[8606.54s -> 8607.18s]  Oh.
[8607.34s -> 8608.54s]  What the fuck was that?
[8609.66s -> 8609.98s]  Ow.
[8609.98s -> 8610.46s]  That was me.
[8612.30s -> 8617.34s]  I helped.
[8617.34s -> 8619.74s]  Some of the portals can be levitated and rotated.
[8620.30s -> 8622.62s]  Hey, new mechanic for you.
[8629.29s -> 8630.65s]  All right, now just do the portal thing.
[8630.65s -> 8631.77s]  You have to do the portal thing at least once.
[8634.01s -> 8634.51s]  Let me go.
[8640.20s -> 8649.36s]  Flip it over.
[8649.36s -> 8650.88s]  You guys, you got to go into the other one.
[8651.44s -> 8652.32s]  Yeah, but how do we do that?
[8652.32s -> 8653.28s]  Hey, we need a box.
[8653.92s -> 8655.52s]  Look, this is a total wizard level.
[8655.52s -> 8656.40s]  Look at this.
[8656.40s -> 8657.12s]  All right, you ready?
[8657.84s -> 8661.68s]  How come my ability is only for one level?
[8662.24s -> 8663.28s]  It's probably introducing it,
[8663.28s -> 8664.80s]  so it's going to be here for the rest of the time.
[8665.92s -> 8668.81s]  I want to be cool.
[8669.69s -> 8671.29s]  Are we open the door?
[8673.29s -> 8674.17s]  You need to move that.
[8675.05s -> 8675.77s]  I can't.
[8675.77s -> 8677.61s]  Only some portals can be moved.
[8677.61s -> 8677.85s]  No, no.
[8677.85s -> 8678.89s]  What about the box through the wall?
[8678.89s -> 8679.93s]  Can you box through the wall?
[8681.48s -> 8681.88s]  Thank you.
[8683.32s -> 8684.44s]  And then Ashley needs to.
[8687.26s -> 8688.86s]  I don't know how you can get it up, though.
[8689.82s -> 8691.23s]  I can do it higher.
[8694.00s -> 8694.64s]  What?
[8694.64s -> 8695.12s]  Freeze it.
[8695.12s -> 8695.60s]  I hit shift.
[8696.24s -> 8698.00s]  No, you can't freeze airborne things.
[8698.56s -> 8698.88s]  Higher.
[8701.29s -> 8701.85s]  There we go.
[8704.24s -> 8705.36s]  We can just get in.
[8706.00s -> 8706.80s]  But why?
[8706.80s -> 8708.56s]  Well, we can go top left.
[8708.56s -> 8710.16s]  That was like the whole reason there was a wall.
[8710.88s -> 8712.40s]  Okay, no, actually charge through that.
[8714.73s -> 8715.77s]  Like charge through the portal.
[8716.73s -> 8717.53s]  Oh, okay.
[8718.49s -> 8720.89s]  For some reason, I thought that was too much to cross.
[8722.57s -> 8723.21s]  I have no idea.
[8726.94s -> 8728.78s]  Why do we move?
[8730.14s -> 8731.50s]  I think these things spawned in.
[8732.30s -> 8734.14s]  It took a long time to spawn.
[8734.14s -> 8734.62s]  Where am I?
[8737.20s -> 8737.68s]  Got him.
[8743.60s -> 8743.84s]  Yeah.
[8745.44s -> 8746.16s]  All right, freeze it.
[8748.41s -> 8750.09s]  But this can be rotated, though, right?
[8751.90s -> 8754.46s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8758.01s -> 8758.49s]  I'll get it.
[8761.84s -> 8762.64s]  I'll get it.
[8762.64s -> 8764.00s]  That wasn't that funny.
[8764.00s -> 8765.20s]  Wasn't that funny.
[8765.20s -> 8766.24s]  It can't be rotated.
[8766.80s -> 8768.48s]  So freeze it.
[8768.96s -> 8769.36s]  Unblock.
[8771.68s -> 8773.20s]  Sometimes it's just that simple, isn't it?
[8776.89s -> 8778.17s]  Sometimes it's that simple.
[8778.73s -> 8779.21s]  Sometimes.
[8779.93s -> 8781.13s]  Not every time, but sometimes.
[8781.77s -> 8782.89s]  And it was funny.
[8783.45s -> 8784.25s]  I don't want to hear it.
[8785.77s -> 8788.99s]  All right, this is your puzzle, Steve.
[8788.99s -> 8789.87s]  Here we go.
[8789.87s -> 8791.47s]  I'm going to stand over here and hide.
[8793.13s -> 8793.93s]  And then blink.
[8793.93s -> 8794.57s]  And not help.
[8794.57s -> 8795.85s]  Is he how spiteful she is?
[8796.57s -> 8798.09s]  You say like one thing one time,
[8798.09s -> 8800.09s]  and then she like holds it over you for the rest of your life.
[8800.73s -> 8803.37s]  That's what marriage is, it's my job.
[8803.37s -> 8804.49s]  But there's a cool thing over there.
[8804.49s -> 8804.89s]  Be accountable.
[8808.43s -> 8809.39s]  This is a cool level.
[8809.39s -> 8810.75s]  I just like the way it looks inside.
[8811.63s -> 8813.26s]  Can I get a box so I can...
[8813.98s -> 8815.50s]  Yeah, this is all you.
[8816.14s -> 8818.94s]  This actually is like just a wizard portion of the game.
[8820.24s -> 8820.72s]  Hold on.
[8821.90s -> 8822.70s]  I'm confused.
[8823.74s -> 8825.58s]  We'll see how long it takes for you to do it.
[8825.58s -> 8829.88s]  Well, wait, wait, wait.
[8829.88s -> 8830.52s]  Ashley, you're...
[8831.64s -> 8834.14s]  I cannot freeze these, can I?
[8834.94s -> 8838.49s]  If I can shoot through.
[8840.33s -> 8842.97s]  I don't think that does anything for us right now.
[8842.97s -> 8843.69s]  Where do I put it?
[8843.69s -> 8845.45s]  My brain is broken right now.
[8845.45s -> 8846.89s]  I can't think, where do I put it?
[8847.53s -> 8850.25s]  All right, so listen, let me help you out here.
[8850.25s -> 8851.05s]  So, okay, so...
[8851.05s -> 8851.69s]  Flip it around.
[8852.97s -> 8853.61s]  I can't do it.
[8853.61s -> 8855.05s]  It doesn't work that way, Ashley.
[8855.05s -> 8857.21s]  Hold on, someone's driving a car into my house.
[8857.21s -> 8857.93s]  Let me give me a second.
[8858.73s -> 8861.37s]  Okay, yeah, you just had it.
[8863.69s -> 8864.65s]  Ashley, if you angle it...
[8864.65s -> 8865.61s]  Yeah, angle it a little bit.
[8866.49s -> 8867.53s]  Oh, that doesn't matter.
[8867.53s -> 8869.29s]  Oh, it was working a second ago.
[8870.41s -> 8873.28s]  Yeah, I can't do that.
[8873.28s -> 8873.84s]  There you go.
[8873.84s -> 8874.64s]  I can do that.
[8874.64s -> 8876.88s]  I can do that.
[8876.88s -> 8877.76s]  Fuck, dude.
[8879.04s -> 8880.06s]  Oh, your box.
[8880.06s -> 8881.50s]  Fuck, you guys are so bad at this game.
[8881.50s -> 8882.54s]  Like, I'm missing dinner now.
[8882.54s -> 8884.40s]  What?
[8884.40s -> 8885.28s]  You don't deserve dinner.
[8885.28s -> 8886.32s]  What is that even from?
[8886.88s -> 8887.76s]  When did I say that?
[8887.76s -> 8889.92s]  I had to have said that recently for you to capture it.
[8890.72s -> 8892.32s]  That was a clip that's...
[8892.32s -> 8892.82s]  Yeah.
[8905.96s -> 8909.72s]  No, it was the BA toxic Overwatch player thing, right?
[8909.72s -> 8911.40s]  You, like, want it to do it.
[8911.40s -> 8915.08s]  And it was right before we had played Dwarf Game.
[8915.72s -> 8918.54s]  Oh, no, somebody Ashley dot, dot, dotted me.
[8920.89s -> 8922.89s]  Oh, well, like, okay, I guess this works.
[8923.69s -> 8926.78s]  Why does this game even bother with combat?
[8927.88s -> 8928.36s]  You know what?
[8928.36s -> 8930.44s]  That is actually a really good question.
[8930.44s -> 8932.52s]  What's the point of even fighting stuff in this game?
[8933.32s -> 8934.12s]  Filler.
[8934.12s -> 8935.08s]  Is it just...
[8935.08s -> 8936.60s]  It's extreme filler, right?
[8936.60s -> 8937.00s]  It has to...
[8937.00s -> 8937.24s]  That's...
[8937.24s -> 8938.52s]  I don't know.
[8938.52s -> 8940.04s]  It breaks up the action a bit.
[8940.04s -> 8940.52s]  I guess.
[8941.24s -> 8944.92s]  I mean, if it was any way challenging, it'd be all right.
[8945.48s -> 8947.08s]  But this game only has easy and normal.
[8947.72s -> 8950.56s]  All right, Steve, look.
[8950.56s -> 8951.06s]  Oracle.
[8951.60s -> 8953.08s]  It's your playground.
[8953.08s -> 8954.12s]  Where is it going to?
[8954.60s -> 8955.32s]  Oh, in there?
[8957.13s -> 8960.73s]  Well, I have access to put like a rope bridge.
[8960.73s -> 8962.88s]  So there's one.
[8963.76s -> 8965.79s]  All right, so it has to stay.
[8965.79s -> 8966.35s]  So hold on.
[8966.99s -> 8967.55s]  Do that again.
[8969.64s -> 8969.96s]  Shit.
[8969.96s -> 8970.12s]  Can I, like...
[8970.12s -> 8971.48s]  Just keep jumping on my box.
[8972.12s -> 8973.47s]  Sorry, it's so tempting.
[8974.03s -> 8974.59s]  Let me...
[8974.59s -> 8975.47s]  I can't freeze the door.
[8976.51s -> 8978.83s]  Just stack them up so it's high enough.
[8980.06s -> 8981.66s]  Get another of these.
[8982.22s -> 8984.06s]  All right, just put the boxes on top of the boxes.
[8986.38s -> 8989.82s]  Put boxes on top of the box?
[8990.94s -> 8993.74s]  And just stack them up and then just make the angle right.
[8994.38s -> 8996.38s]  But you got to have it be the right one on the right angle.
[8997.88s -> 8999.00s]  Oh, that didn't work.
[9001.74s -> 9003.98s]  The third box has to be the one doing it.
[9010.86s -> 9011.42s]  Oh, okay.
[9011.42s -> 9012.06s]  So then wait.
[9012.06s -> 9012.46s]  Hold on.
[9017.00s -> 9017.56s]  Just go up.
[9017.56s -> 9018.60s]  Just climb up.
[9018.60s -> 9019.00s]  Oh.
[9019.00s -> 9019.80s]  But what about you guys?
[9020.52s -> 9021.52s]  Figure it out.
[9022.16s -> 9024.75s]  I mean, I can put the rope up.
[9025.31s -> 9028.00s]  I guess it's still working.
[9029.36s -> 9030.32s]  I guess.
[9030.32s -> 9030.72s]  Whatever.
[9036.64s -> 9037.76s]  Dot, dot, dot.
[9038.72s -> 9041.47s]  Maybe it means we have a dungeon down there.
[9041.47s -> 9042.03s]  It's lore.
[9042.03s -> 9044.03s]  No, there were things up there.
[9044.03s -> 9044.67s]  Were there?
[9044.67s -> 9045.55s]  Well, I...
[9045.55s -> 9046.11s]  I'm sorry.
[9047.07s -> 9048.75s]  Oh, no.
[9048.75s -> 9049.87s]  Elevator fight sequence.
[9049.87s -> 9050.99s]  Oh, what are we going to do?
[9051.95s -> 9055.36s]  Quick a bunch.
[9055.36s -> 9056.48s]  I'm going to do fire on this one.
[9056.48s -> 9057.44s]  It's going to feel like it's cool.
[9058.08s -> 9058.72s]  Yep.
[9058.72s -> 9059.28s]  Never mind.
[9066.76s -> 9067.56s]  We just have to move.
[9069.24s -> 9070.28s]  What about this?
[9070.28s -> 9072.62s]  There was a terrible old scare over here.
[9072.62s -> 9074.35s]  There are a lot of secrets in this game, though.
[9076.22s -> 9077.66s]  What do I do?
[9077.66s -> 9079.02s]  You missed a door with a hookah.
[9079.66s -> 9080.30s]  Door with a hookah.
[9081.90s -> 9082.54s]  Door with a hookah?
[9083.10s -> 9083.90s]  It can be opened?
[9084.54s -> 9086.22s]  I'm pulling.
[9087.36s -> 9087.68s]  Oh.
[9087.68s -> 9088.48s]  It goes up.
[9089.20s -> 9089.44s]  Okay.
[9089.44s -> 9090.32s]  So, yeah.
[9090.32s -> 9091.92s]  Just give me a boost.
[9095.32s -> 9096.28s]  Get off the box.
[9096.28s -> 9097.88s]  Just let me pull the wire up.
[9100.00s -> 9100.40s]  What do you mean?
[9101.28s -> 9102.00s]  Oh, I see what you mean.
[9102.00s -> 9102.24s]  Okay.
[9104.60s -> 9105.08s]  Okay.
[9105.08s -> 9105.88s]  I don't think that works.
[9106.52s -> 9107.48s]  That has always worked.
[9110.76s -> 9112.04s]  It was for a second there, see?
[9114.46s -> 9115.74s]  Why are we on different planes?
[9117.28s -> 9118.08s]  Yeah, see, now it's...
[9118.64s -> 9120.99s]  Okay.
[9120.99s -> 9121.79s]  Never mind.
[9121.79s -> 9122.99s]  But we have to get in here, though.
[9123.55s -> 9124.03s]  We do.
[9124.03s -> 9125.15s]  You have to get in here.
[9125.15s -> 9125.71s]  It's taunting me.
[9127.71s -> 9129.26s]  Put your shield up.
[9129.82s -> 9139.07s]  No, I can't yank it up.
[9142.08s -> 9143.66s]  We were doing it before.
[9144.38s -> 9145.42s]  I could have made it in.
[9145.42s -> 9147.26s]  Try to do the thing where you push me up again.
[9150.33s -> 9151.61s]  It's kind of working a little.
[9152.49s -> 9153.05s]  It's staying.
[9153.77s -> 9154.96s]  All right.
[9154.96s -> 9155.20s]  Keep going.
[9155.20s -> 9156.00s]  Come on, game.
[9158.17s -> 9159.29s]  Come on, game.
[9159.29s -> 9160.57s]  Just brute force it.
[9160.57s -> 9160.81s]  All right.
[9160.81s -> 9161.29s]  Do it again.
[9163.20s -> 9163.52s]  All right.
[9163.52s -> 9163.92s]  Get in.
[9164.56s -> 9164.96s]  Get in.
[9166.72s -> 9167.12s]  Freeze it.
[9168.00s -> 9168.88s]  Was that it?
[9169.60s -> 9170.00s]  Freeze it.
[9170.00s -> 9171.20s]  I think that was it.
[9171.20s -> 9171.68s]  Freeze it.
[9172.24s -> 9173.07s]  I got it.
[9173.07s -> 9173.95s]  I think that was it.
[9173.95s -> 9174.27s]  No.
[9174.27s -> 9175.39s]  I can even go in now.
[9175.39s -> 9176.35s]  You can't even go in there.
[9176.35s -> 9177.47s]  I froze the door closed.
[9178.35s -> 9179.07s]  Good job.
[9179.07s -> 9179.47s]  No, but this...
[9179.47s -> 9180.59s]  You did that before, too.
[9182.78s -> 9183.34s]  Oh, whatever.
[9183.34s -> 9184.38s]  Someone else will get it one day.
[9184.94s -> 9188.36s]  The next set of adventures.
[9188.92s -> 9189.24s]  Yeah.
[9189.80s -> 9190.60s]  Someone else will do it.
[9191.64s -> 9192.04s]  Later.
[9194.67s -> 9195.07s]  Oh, God.
[9197.31s -> 9197.95s]  All right.
[9197.95s -> 9199.07s]  I'm just going to do it regular.
[9205.55s -> 9206.59s]  Wait, what?
[9206.59s -> 9208.35s]  Oh, you've lowered the poison.
[9208.99s -> 9216.01s]  But we didn't even go in here.
[9216.01s -> 9216.97s]  Look at the stuff in here.
[9217.85s -> 9218.09s]  Where?
[9218.97s -> 9219.45s]  There's three...
[9224.44s -> 9224.92s]  You got them?
[9240.03s -> 9240.35s]  Okay.
[9240.35s -> 9241.07s]  Well, we're over here.
[9242.11s -> 9244.03s]  And then I think now you have to spin this
[9244.75s -> 9246.99s]  so we can jump into it and launch ourselves up.
[9247.71s -> 9249.13s]  Mm hmm.
[9249.13s -> 9252.86s]  Can you do it?
[9252.86s -> 9254.14s]  Now you're thinking with PODL.
[9255.10s -> 9259.47s]  Now you have to go up this door and go to the right.
[9260.51s -> 9261.55s]  Now you have to fight a wolf.
[9263.71s -> 9265.39s]  Hey, Nightmare Wolf.
[9265.39s -> 9270.67s]  Hey, Wolf.
[9270.67s -> 9271.15s]  Whoa.
[9271.15s -> 9271.39s]  What?
[9272.99s -> 9274.51s]  Were you just doing that?
[9274.51s -> 9274.83s]  Yeah.
[9275.96s -> 9277.72s]  That's my cool ability that I unlock
[9277.72s -> 9280.28s]  is moving the pointless enemies around.
[9280.92s -> 9281.56s]  I froze it.
[9281.56s -> 9281.88s]  Sorry.
[9283.00s -> 9292.43s]  What are you trying to do here?
[9295.82s -> 9297.34s]  Yeah, I can't put a box there.
[9297.34s -> 9298.54s]  No box guy.
[9298.54s -> 9301.82s]  Well, you guys are now down there
[9302.78s -> 9303.58s]  and you get across
[9305.08s -> 9306.04s]  and then you can get across
[9306.68s -> 9308.52s]  and then I can get across because of this.
[9309.32s -> 9310.44s]  I can grab this thing.
[9311.24s -> 9312.36s]  Just give me a box for a second.
[9317.69s -> 9318.01s]  Fuck.
[9318.57s -> 9319.13s]  Fuck.
[9319.13s -> 9320.25s]  You need to be on the ledge.
[9322.70s -> 9325.74s]  I have to make a bridge like that.
[9325.74s -> 9326.86s]  Oopsie daisy.
[9326.86s -> 9327.26s]  Oopsie.
[9329.31s -> 9330.03s]  I can't really.
[9330.03s -> 9330.99s]  Oh, now I can.
[9330.99s -> 9331.55s]  Oopsie.
[9332.51s -> 9333.39s]  I don't know how to help you.
[9335.74s -> 9338.46s]  Jerma probably does not remember that he can roll.
[9338.46s -> 9339.42s]  I know how to help you.
[9339.42s -> 9340.46s]  I can put a box on that.
[9340.46s -> 9342.70s]  Wait, why is that coming out like halfway?
[9343.58s -> 9344.14s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[9344.14s -> 9345.10s]  You put the box down there.
[9345.10s -> 9345.26s]  All right.
[9345.26s -> 9345.74s]  Lift it up.
[9346.38s -> 9346.86s]  Press button.
[9347.93s -> 9348.17s]  Okay.
[9348.17s -> 9348.57s]  Now wait.
[9349.69s -> 9350.01s]  Hold on.
[9350.41s -> 9351.21s]  This is going to be hard.
[9352.09s -> 9353.77s]  Oh, you can just go down the second thing.
[9354.65s -> 9355.61s]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[9355.61s -> 9357.21s]  I forgot Jerma could roll too.
[9357.21s -> 9358.49s]  Why does he get to roll?
[9358.49s -> 9358.81s]  Okay.
[9358.81s -> 9359.37s]  Now do it again.
[9360.09s -> 9360.49s]  Thank you.
[9361.52s -> 9361.76s]  Now.
[9363.74s -> 9364.06s]  Thank you.
[9365.37s -> 9365.77s]  No, no, no.
[9365.77s -> 9366.81s]  Put it over here where I can do it.
[9366.81s -> 9368.57s]  You can just roll from box to hook.
[9369.29s -> 9371.36s]  What if it falls?
[9372.32s -> 9373.92s]  Well, you look cooler that way.
[9374.72s -> 9375.12s]  Yeah, I know.
[9375.12s -> 9379.52s]  I can roll, but I roll into a waterfall.
[9380.40s -> 9380.64s]  Water.
[9380.64s -> 9380.96s]  I don't know.
[9380.96s -> 9381.28s]  Whatever.
[9381.28s -> 9381.68s]  I don't know.
[9382.72s -> 9390.06s]  Yeah.
[9390.06s -> 9390.62s]  How funny.
[9390.62s -> 9391.42s]  How can you do that?
[9391.42s -> 9391.66s]  Huh?
[9392.38s -> 9395.58s]  I mean, I know I have to roll, but the roll doesn't give me like extra.
[9396.14s -> 9397.42s]  Like I can roll like this.
[9398.06s -> 9401.26s]  But if I was ready, like I just roll into the arm.
[9401.26s -> 9402.30s]  What are you guys saying?
[9402.30s -> 9402.86s]  I want to roll.
[9402.86s -> 9403.90s]  I've been rolling around the whole time.
[9404.70s -> 9410.27s]  It doesn't give me like extra momentum.
[9414.54s -> 9414.78s]  All right.
[9414.78s -> 9415.50s]  You do that again.
[9415.50s -> 9417.02s]  I'm going to do the SpongeBob laugh again.
[9417.02s -> 9420.06s]  And everyone's going to be pissed at you because you made that happen.
[9420.06s -> 9421.90s]  I haven't heard you do the SpongeBob laugh.
[9423.02s -> 9426.24s]  Oh my God.
[9426.24s -> 9427.68s]  We have to have this hit all of them.
[9430.52s -> 9430.92s]  Come on.
[9434.06s -> 9434.94s]  Oh, almost.
[9435.74s -> 9436.62s]  Just make it.
[9436.62s -> 9436.86s]  Yeah.
[9438.62s -> 9439.10s]  Okay.
[9440.22s -> 9440.78s]  Let's go.
[9441.66s -> 9442.54s]  Look, it made a ladder.
[9447.80s -> 9448.44s]  All right.
[9448.44s -> 9449.20s]  Cool.
[9449.20s -> 9451.68s]  Instead of moving boxes, I can move one other object.
[9452.40s -> 9454.80s]  Uh, I'm about, I'm going to, I'm going to light this up.
[9454.80s -> 9455.92s]  So it's going to move.
[9455.92s -> 9456.40s]  Oh, wait.
[9456.40s -> 9456.96s]  I'm very right.
[9456.96s -> 9457.92s]  That's how that works.
[9459.92s -> 9460.48s]  We did it.
[9464.83s -> 9468.49s]  I, uh, I can freeze it.
[9468.49s -> 9469.05s]  Oh, you got it.
[9469.69s -> 9471.77s]  Doesn't even need our help.
[9473.20s -> 9473.92s]  He's a big boy.
[9475.72s -> 9478.68s]  Guide the two light beams through the yellow crystals on the sides of the cube
[9478.68s -> 9481.00s]  to combine them into a single stronger beam.
[9481.88s -> 9483.93s]  Interesting.
[9483.93s -> 9484.17s]  Thanks.
[9484.17s -> 9484.89s]  Like it boys.
[9485.69s -> 9488.60s]  Oh, it does make a super beam.
[9489.24s -> 9492.00s]  Pardon me.
[9492.08s -> 9496.75s]  Oh, we all fell off.
[9496.75s -> 9497.31s]  It looks like.
[9501.52s -> 9514.91s]  No, perfect time for the demon voice.
[9514.91s -> 9516.43s]  And it didn't do it.
[9516.43s -> 9517.07s]  Yeah, it's true.
[9517.71s -> 9518.83s]  Uh, why are we?
[9518.83s -> 9519.33s]  What?
[9520.03s -> 9520.83s]  We're all wizards.
[9522.75s -> 9524.38s]  I don't even know how to use the wizard.
[9524.94s -> 9528.36s]  Well, you know, he only played through his tutorial twice.
[9530.54s -> 9533.44s]  Oh no.
[9535.85s -> 9538.09s]  A problem that I can't smash the head with.
[9540.17s -> 9540.41s]  All right.
[9540.41s -> 9540.89s]  Hold on.
[9540.89s -> 9543.61s]  There's this, the middle thing can be moved.
[9543.61s -> 9544.01s]  All right.
[9544.01s -> 9547.55s]  Put, put a spinner over here.
[9549.56s -> 9551.16s]  Somebody guide the light.
[9554.52s -> 9554.76s]  Yeah.
[9555.32s -> 9555.64s]  Okay.
[9556.36s -> 9560.72s]  Now, um, what do we do with that thing?
[9562.00s -> 9563.20s]  She's holding onto the edge.
[9563.20s -> 9564.40s]  I can't rotate this one.
[9572.84s -> 9579.76s]  Oh, I mean, it's going in, but what I think we have to do a super beam over there.
[9580.56s -> 9583.18s]  Yeah, I don't.
[9584.40s -> 9584.72s]  Okay.
[9588.88s -> 9592.76s]  Oh, actually just smashing the box.
[9592.76s -> 9593.48s]  You're not helping.
[9593.48s -> 9594.76s]  I'm not involved in this.
[9594.76s -> 9595.00s]  All right.
[9595.00s -> 9595.72s]  What do you get the get?
[9595.72s -> 9595.88s]  Yeah.
[9595.88s -> 9600.49s]  Grab that one and then we have to turn.
[9601.37s -> 9602.17s]  You can rotate that.
[9602.17s -> 9602.41s]  Right?
[9602.41s -> 9602.73s]  Okay.
[9606.76s -> 9607.40s]  Bring it forward.
[9608.20s -> 9609.72s]  Oh, we have to do it to the cold.
[9609.72s -> 9609.80s]  Yeah.
[9609.80s -> 9610.60s]  It's going to go on the college.
[9610.60s -> 9612.44s]  See, like it, it's got to end up shooting up.
[9613.48s -> 9618.73s]  Oh, so then I can just standing here watching us do this.
[9620.54s -> 9621.10s]  They'll get it.
[9621.10s -> 9621.74s]  Any minute now.
[9622.38s -> 9624.46s]  They didn't die on boredom.
[9626.08s -> 9627.76s]  I thought we were aiming at the wall.
[9627.76s -> 9629.44s]  No, don't worry.
[9629.44s -> 9631.04s]  We're going to do this like two or three more times.
[9632.00s -> 9633.80s]  I actually won't.
[9634.28s -> 9634.52s]  What?
[9635.08s -> 9636.28s]  I actually won't have to.
[9637.88s -> 9639.40s]  I feel like more than two people.
[9640.04s -> 9641.56s]  You're just like getting in the way.
[9641.56s -> 9644.04s]  Come stand on the left and go take a shit or something.
[9645.08s -> 9646.28s]  Oh, I do have to take a shit.
[9646.28s -> 9646.84s]  I'll be back.
[9647.96s -> 9648.64s]  Okay.
[9648.64s -> 9648.96s]  Hold on.
[9649.76s -> 9653.28s]  So you just move over to the right and I think I can do it.
[9656.78s -> 9658.54s]  Well, how are you seeing that?
[9659.50s -> 9660.38s]  It's got to go up.
[9661.34s -> 9662.22s]  You got to put yours.
[9662.22s -> 9663.26s]  It's got to be you.
[9663.26s -> 9664.14s]  You got to be shooting it up.
[9665.10s -> 9667.87s]  It's got to go up through the middle portal here.
[9669.10s -> 9670.38s]  That thing's got to go over here.
[9671.18s -> 9673.10s]  How do you rotate?
[9674.64s -> 9675.76s]  Z and X.
[9675.76s -> 9676.08s]  Z.
[9676.08s -> 9676.32s]  Okay.
[9676.32s -> 9677.44s]  Well, I'm using it.
[9677.44s -> 9678.08s]  I'm using it.
[9678.08s -> 9678.88s]  I don't know, dude.
[9678.88s -> 9680.40s]  I'm not using a controller.
[9681.92s -> 9687.40s]  So how would you maybe it has to be down here?
[9688.96s -> 9690.24s]  Well, two beams have to hit it.
[9691.23s -> 9692.75s]  Wait, how do we just have it?
[9693.39s -> 9694.03s]  Get rid of this.
[9694.03s -> 9696.59s]  If we just get rid of this box right here.
[9697.39s -> 9698.89s]  Put this box in the cauldron.
[9698.89s -> 9699.29s]  There you go.
[9699.29s -> 9699.69s]  Right there.
[9700.33s -> 9702.25s]  Nice job.
[9713.61s -> 9714.17s]  Good to work.
[9714.89s -> 9717.28s]  So this is aiming down.
[9718.54s -> 9720.86s]  I actually left a fucking box in here.
[9720.86s -> 9721.74s]  It's just in the way.
[9723.50s -> 9724.78s]  It's just a box here.
[9725.50s -> 9725.74s]  All right.
[9725.74s -> 9726.30s]  What about this?
[9726.30s -> 9727.18s]  Can you do anything with that?
[9729.32s -> 9730.59s]  Can you get like the double?
[9731.61s -> 9732.25s]  Oh, no.
[9733.13s -> 9734.12s]  All right.
[9734.12s -> 9735.40s]  What about if I grab this one?
[9735.96s -> 9737.31s]  Anything happen when I do this?
[9738.03s -> 9740.04s]  All right.
[9740.04s -> 9740.28s]  Hold on.
[9740.28s -> 9741.08s]  What about what about?
[9741.08s -> 9741.56s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[9742.36s -> 9743.24s]  Can you do anything with that?
[9744.54s -> 9746.94s]  Um, maybe check it out.
[9746.94s -> 9748.78s]  Can you angle it with that one?
[9748.78s -> 9749.58s]  I don't think so.
[9749.98s -> 9750.78s]  That's blocking them.
[9750.78s -> 9752.94s]  They know they're around this one.
[9752.94s -> 9753.90s]  You can't do it with this one here.
[9753.90s -> 9754.94s]  Like in the center here.
[9755.90s -> 9757.98s]  I'll hold this right there.
[9758.78s -> 9762.52s]  This fucking box.
[9763.56s -> 9764.86s]  Oh, I'm back.
[9764.86s -> 9765.66s]  What happened?
[9765.66s -> 9766.62s]  Delete your box.
[9767.34s -> 9768.22s]  Oh, shit.
[9769.50s -> 9769.82s]  How?
[9770.62s -> 9771.50s]  We almost got it.
[9771.50s -> 9771.90s]  Hold on.
[9773.92s -> 9774.40s]  Wait, hold on.
[9774.40s -> 9775.36s]  What if I do this?
[9775.36s -> 9776.32s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[9776.32s -> 9776.88s]  Put it back up.
[9776.88s -> 9777.36s]  No, back up.
[9777.36s -> 9778.56s]  Move it.
[9778.56s -> 9779.48s]  All right.
[9779.48s -> 9779.88s]  I'll turn.
[9781.56s -> 9781.80s]  Wait.
[9782.52s -> 9783.92s]  All right.
[9783.92s -> 9785.04s]  I can't get it to aim there.
[9786.16s -> 9786.56s]  Hold on.
[9786.56s -> 9789.24s]  I need if I go like this.
[9790.04s -> 9790.44s]  Hold on.
[9791.08s -> 9793.32s]  I'm either going to have to have the box be here.
[9795.74s -> 9796.86s]  What are we doing?
[9796.86s -> 9797.98s]  What's the point of the middle?
[9797.98s -> 9799.42s]  Oh, that has to be lit.
[9800.22s -> 9802.22s]  Or the cauldron to even open.
[9802.22s -> 9803.18s]  Oh, shit.
[9805.26s -> 9806.14s]  Okay, well, hold on.
[9806.14s -> 9807.66s]  Then this one has to go this way.
[9808.70s -> 9809.98s]  Then this one has to go this way.
[9814.67s -> 9816.16s]  No, shit.
[9823.42s -> 9824.14s]  This one has to go.
[9826.08s -> 9826.64s]  Shit.
[9826.64s -> 9827.20s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[9827.20s -> 9827.84s]  Let go of it.
[9827.84s -> 9828.48s]  Let go of that one.
[9828.48s -> 9829.04s]  Let go of this one.
[9829.60s -> 9830.16s]  Yeah, I think.
[9833.29s -> 9834.57s]  And now you've got to double here,
[9835.45s -> 9836.57s]  but it's got to be angled up.
[9838.33s -> 9839.69s]  Put your box under this, Ash.
[9840.65s -> 9840.89s]  What?
[9842.68s -> 9843.00s]  Hold on.
[9843.00s -> 9843.40s]  Let's see.
[9843.40s -> 9844.52s]  No, that's not going to do anything.
[9847.42s -> 9848.06s]  Wait.
[9848.06s -> 9851.55s]  All right.
[9851.55s -> 9852.99s]  Let me hold that here
[9853.71s -> 9855.24s]  because I don't know what the button is.
[9855.96s -> 9858.04s]  I actually do not know what the button is
[9858.04s -> 9859.40s]  to rotate on control.
[9859.40s -> 9860.84s]  Yeah, but if I put this here, it blocks.
[9862.59s -> 9863.47s]  Still lit up.
[9863.47s -> 9864.51s]  Oh, to the right.
[9864.51s -> 9865.95s]  I can do that, but then I can't aim it.
[9865.95s -> 9866.99s]  Yeah, you can.
[9866.99s -> 9867.71s]  Keep going to the right.
[9869.52s -> 9870.72s]  You can only do that or that.
[9870.72s -> 9872.32s]  Yeah, but how far can you go to the right?
[9872.96s -> 9875.82s]  Can you go up?
[9876.22s -> 9878.44s]  Oh, shit.
[9878.44s -> 9879.88s]  Like, how close can you?
[9880.44s -> 9881.48s]  This isn't going to get it.
[9882.44s -> 9882.68s]  Fuck.
[9885.13s -> 9888.14s]  Um, here, let me try that.
[9888.14s -> 9888.94s]  Let me grab that.
[9889.66s -> 9891.66s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[9891.66s -> 9893.02s]  What if I, what if you put a box under that?
[9893.66s -> 9895.36s]  The box is.
[9895.36s -> 9896.24s]  Well, I wanted to get this
[9896.24s -> 9897.52s]  at a sideways angle to shoot up,
[9897.52s -> 9898.32s]  but I guess you can't do it.
[9898.32s -> 9899.12s]  So no matter what,
[9899.12s -> 9901.04s]  this is going to have to be down here.
[9901.04s -> 9901.28s]  Yeah.
[9901.28s -> 9903.12s]  So then the only thing that works.
[9903.12s -> 9904.40s]  So a box has to be under there.
[9905.44s -> 9910.14s]  Ashley, drop your box.
[9910.70s -> 9915.82s]  Okay.
[9915.82s -> 9922.65s]  Now it's a question of moving this one.
[9923.37s -> 9924.64s]  Hold on.
[9924.64s -> 9925.12s]  Let me see this.
[9926.00s -> 9930.30s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[9930.30s -> 9931.64s]  Because this is just shooting down.
[9933.76s -> 9934.00s]  Yeah.
[9934.00s -> 9935.12s]  And you can't rotate it.
[9935.12s -> 9935.36s]  Yeah.
[9935.36s -> 9937.04s]  Well, it went to move that one back to where it was.
[9937.84s -> 9945.20s]  What if, um, bring it all the way down?
[9945.20s -> 9946.78s]  Does that do?
[9946.78s -> 9947.18s]  It just shoots.
[9947.18s -> 9948.38s]  Oh, that doesn't.
[9948.38s -> 9949.82s]  The poor chat isn't paid.
[9953.32s -> 9953.88s]  Uh, okay.
[9966.38s -> 9970.01s]  Um, yeah.
[9970.01s -> 9976.56s]  But if you do it like that, then I don't this,
[9976.56s -> 9978.32s]  this, which is more patient than you guys.
[9980.99s -> 9981.23s]  Yeah.
[9981.23s -> 9983.47s]  And this, this person's trying to kill us.
[9983.47s -> 9984.19s]  So come on.
[9984.83s -> 9988.57s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[9988.57s -> 9988.89s]  Hold on.
[9989.85s -> 9990.49s]  Shoot into this.
[9992.35s -> 9993.39s]  Can we do something with this?
[9993.39s -> 9995.47s]  Do we, why are we trying to shoot that into?
[9997.07s -> 9999.55s]  Because that one's going to shoot straight down.
[9999.55s -> 10000.51s]  Why don't we angle it?
[10000.51s -> 10003.39s]  And why don't we angle the shot into the fucking bottom one?
[10004.03s -> 10006.62s]  What do you mean?
[10006.62s -> 10009.21s]  I mean, do, why do we, why do we have to like aim it
[10009.21s -> 10010.33s]  and shoot it like at an angle?
[10012.59s -> 10013.87s]  Can you reflect the double beam?
[10014.99s -> 10017.15s]  It's always, these are always right angles.
[10017.79s -> 10019.95s]  Yeah, but you can, we can reflect the,
[10019.95s -> 10023.68s]  the super beam off of one of the mirrors, right?
[10025.77s -> 10026.09s]  Yeah.
[10026.81s -> 10028.94s]  But the mirrors are always right angles.
[10028.94s -> 10031.90s]  So this mirror always has to shoot up to get this thing.
[10031.90s -> 10033.18s]  We can't have like a weird,
[10034.38s -> 10036.30s]  I guess we could have like a half angle.
[10036.30s -> 10040.14s]  If we fucking slightly tilted it on another,
[10040.14s -> 10042.22s]  like there's no way that's the point.
[10044.32s -> 10046.00s]  Just put super beam in the middle.
[10046.00s -> 10046.72s]  Sure for it.
[10046.72s -> 10047.60s]  That's what I'm saying.
[10047.60s -> 10049.04s]  The super beam has to be in the middle.
[10055.36s -> 10055.60s]  Actually.
[10055.60s -> 10056.32s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10056.32s -> 10056.96s]  Drop everything.
[10056.96s -> 10058.64s]  Jerma drop it all, drop it all.
[10060.11s -> 10061.71s]  The top left one has to change, doesn't it?
[10063.68s -> 10064.32s]  I've got it.
[10066.17s -> 10066.81s]  I've got it.
[10072.76s -> 10075.40s]  See, I didn't think that the super beam could open the cauldron.
[10076.12s -> 10076.52s]  All right.
[10076.52s -> 10077.16s]  Level three.
[10078.52s -> 10079.80s]  That's what my hangup was.
[10081.80s -> 10083.32s]  I don't, I don't fucking know, dude.
[10084.20s -> 10084.92s]  It's tricky.
[10086.88s -> 10087.12s]  Okay.
[10087.12s -> 10101.18s]  So now we have the super beam.
[10104.92s -> 10106.28s]  It's a ball of market now.
[10106.28s -> 10107.16s]  Killer.
[10107.16s -> 10107.64s]  Burner.
[10110.91s -> 10112.27s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10112.27s -> 10113.23s]  You just got to do that the other way.
[10114.03s -> 10115.52s]  We're just going to flip this whole thing.
[10116.32s -> 10117.28s]  Well, you just mirror.
[10118.36s -> 10120.84s]  No, but we just mirror what we just did and then push this up.
[10121.64s -> 10125.63s]  Well, then that shoots this into the ground.
[10126.19s -> 10127.47s]  That's not mirror.
[10127.47s -> 10128.27s]  Sure for what do we do?
[10138.48s -> 10138.72s]  Okay.
[10138.72s -> 10140.40s]  Wait, wait, drop the thing you're moving around.
[10140.40s -> 10143.20s]  That has to shoot your, it has to go down down.
[10143.20s -> 10144.80s]  It has to go up ahead.
[10144.80s -> 10145.20s]  Okay.
[10145.20s -> 10146.80s]  So then move.
[10147.76s -> 10148.96s]  Now that's, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[10150.00s -> 10157.13s]  Now you should be able to angle it.
[10157.13s -> 10158.09s]  If it, if you go.
[10159.29s -> 10161.69s]  Oh, there's two things that I think will be lit up.
[10161.69s -> 10165.53s]  So if you, what do you move this one down a little?
[10167.58s -> 10173.74s]  Like, can we, that one's not doing much.
[10173.74s -> 10174.30s]  This one has to be.
[10175.10s -> 10177.60s]  All right.
[10177.60s -> 10178.32s]  Let me see.
[10178.32s -> 10179.76s]  You know, sure for is on it.
[10179.76s -> 10180.00s]  All right.
[10180.00s -> 10180.88s]  Sure for what do you think?
[10181.52s -> 10182.24s]  Left down.
[10183.12s -> 10186.88s]  That's what I was just thinking, but I don't, you have to flip it twice.
[10191.04s -> 10191.28s]  Why?
[10191.28s -> 10192.48s]  What happened to the German stock?
[10192.48s -> 10194.00s]  When did he get a bunch of minus twos?
[10195.28s -> 10198.40s]  Because, because us not being able to figure out a puzzle is,
[10198.40s -> 10199.84s]  is a bad joke, apparently.
[10201.29s -> 10201.69s]  I guess.
[10202.73s -> 10205.37s]  Imagine being so jaded at like everything you watch.
[10208.17s -> 10211.79s]  Trying to see if I can get this at a sideways angle.
[10212.67s -> 10215.72s]  Move right down.
[10217.88s -> 10219.32s]  We can do more than one box.
[10221.98s -> 10223.26s]  Left down and hit the yellow.
[10225.98s -> 10227.02s]  Then move right down.
[10227.74s -> 10232.06s]  Then what we do, what do we do with this?
[10234.36s -> 10236.68s]  Cause it has to go all the way up to the top left.
[10236.68s -> 10238.12s]  It's gotta like shoot into the top left.
[10238.84s -> 10243.02s]  Here, here, here, here.
[10243.02s -> 10243.74s]  I got it.
[10243.74s -> 10248.96s]  I got it.
[10248.96s -> 10249.20s]  Yeah.
[10249.20s -> 10252.32s]  But now that has to be this has to be mirrored the other way.
[10252.32s -> 10252.72s]  Hold on.
[10252.72s -> 10253.52s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10253.52s -> 10255.20s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, don't, don't wait, wait, wait.
[10255.20s -> 10255.68s]  Nobody move.
[10256.65s -> 10257.93s]  Do exactly what you just did.
[10257.93s -> 10258.89s]  There's one on the ground right here.
[10259.90s -> 10260.62s]  Hold on.
[10260.62s -> 10261.18s]  Get rid of this.
[10261.90s -> 10263.10s]  How do I get rid of this fucking thing?
[10263.82s -> 10274.44s]  Okay, do exactly what you just did got it
[10286.39s -> 10292.70s]  Finally you actually did it minus two you fucking guys are so bad at this game like I'm missing dinner. No
[10306.77s -> 10314.44s]  Even though which is talking shit. Well, she's a witch. Isn't that kind of what they do? That's her job
[10326.75s -> 10330.01s]  The cat
[10353.93s -> 10358.78s]  What was the whole thing with the likes wimmy's
[10359.66s -> 10365.38s]  Back then you see like on his shoulders like the big swimmies the big like inflated pads
[10369.34s -> 10372.14s]  Is that like a there's like a status symbol or something
[10373.66s -> 10379.86s]  Yeah, like in blizzard like the better you are at blizzard world of warcraft the bigger shoulders are oh
[10380.46s -> 10382.98s]  My god, he looks really weird without a helmet
[10392.23s -> 10396.85s]  I think I have to go. I'm just double-checking that
[10398.37s -> 10400.21s]  Where you going?
[10400.21s -> 10402.65s]  D&D, I think it's it's time. Oh
[10403.61s -> 10409.09s]  You're gonna go. Yeah, I'm right sure for he knows he's there. He's one of the boys right? Oh
[10410.44s -> 10413.72s]  No stars got to get out of here star and Ashley gotta go
[10415.48s -> 10420.52s]  All right, let me uh, this is important though before you leave do you want to play this again? I do
[10421.84s -> 10424.28s]  You want to finish this game? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right
[10427.16s -> 10429.16s]  Weekend trying
[10429.52s -> 10431.52s]  Tuesday trying trying whatever it is
[10432.04s -> 10439.10s]  One day I'll unlock my second ability conjured a ball and then I'll finally unlock two objects
[10441.22s -> 10448.16s]  Trying Tuesday's all right. Well, I just really sincerely hope it'll let us pick up from where we stopped
[10448.60s -> 10451.44s]  Well, I keep saying saving in the top right
[10451.44s -> 10453.80s]  I'm assuming that means it's saving the game
[10454.48s -> 10457.72s]  Right. It's all up to Steve. So it's all
[10458.08s -> 10464.00s]  I've got all I can select level from this screen. I'm gonna assume everything is great. It says saving
[10464.00s -> 10466.00s]  I'm going to continue quitting to desktop
[10466.72s -> 10468.72s]  Okay, and then I'm going to
[10470.40s -> 10475.48s]  You know, Merry Christmas on German, I'm gonna wish you a Merry Christmas have fun at your at your sesh
[10476.04s -> 10481.32s]  I'm gonna have a Dean Dungeons and Dragons sesh. Cool. I you know, I gotta go
[10481.32s -> 10486.76s]  But German is gonna play some old Atari game. You never heard of I think and you're gonna be like, wow
[10486.76s -> 10488.76s]  This is he's such a boomer
[10489.04s -> 10491.58s]  It'll be great
[10491.58s -> 10495.46s]  Now that actually sounds like a pretty good idea. They got an Atari like 2600 scream
[10496.02s -> 10501.14s]  Like play the one of the oldest existing football games that were like on the Nintendos
[10501.46s -> 10509.06s]  That's that was pretty cool a for all buttons for all actions, but it's hot hot a hike a a a pass a
[10509.70s -> 10511.70s]  run to goal a
[10512.62s -> 10517.70s]  I'll dig ET out of a landfill somewhere and play that too. I guess. Okay. Yeah, maybe
[10518.22s -> 10524.34s]  But hey, see ya see you next Sunday for trying Sundays. Yeah. See ya. All right. See ya. See you later guys
[10524.86s -> 10529.79s]  that was us that was star and Ashley both very fun cool people and
[10531.70s -> 10533.10s]  I
[10533.10s -> 10536.71s]  I'm gonna give you an unfortunate circumstance here
[10537.31s -> 10543.96s]  I'm gonna I have to leave I'm gonna go to I'm starting to feel a little
[10544.92s -> 10546.84s]  Strange downstairs
[10546.84s -> 10555.84s]  So I I have to go. I will be live tomorrow. This is actually into the stream. I do have to leave
[10556.76s -> 10565.20s]  So I'm sorry, but it's okay because like I said, we'll there's gonna be less time on stream
[10565.20s -> 10567.20s]  But there can be more days. So I'll be live tomorrow
[10567.92s -> 10572.22s]  I'll be live tomorrow at the same time. So we're on like one or two tomorrow
[10572.76s -> 10581.28s]  I'm going to start the thing. We took a nice little break from horror shit
[10581.36s -> 10595.51s]  So tomorrow we're gonna go to the thing should be interesting same time. He hates screaming
[10595.51s -> 10603.60s]  I still think that's funny. But yeah, well trying it's fun. It's fun. Just to just play a game sometimes
[10604.24s -> 10612.57s]  Brings me back, you know when the three of us played games, so you'll see trying to get next weekend
[10612.57s -> 10614.85s]  We'll just I'm sure we'll probably get somewhere close to the end
[10614.85s -> 10620.76s]  What is it like a today 10-hour game something like that? I think that sounds like plan to me
[10620.80s -> 10625.44s]  But I'm not gonna leave just yet. I am going to just be right back for a minute
[10625.48s -> 10632.36s]  I'm going to get some water and I'll come back and we'll do the bits and then I'll see you guys tomorrow
[10632.36s -> 10636.27s]  I'll see you guys really soon. Be right back
[10751.84s -> 10754.17s]  Sound
[10754.17s -> 10756.35s]  Yeah, I'm here
[10757.19s -> 10760.51s]  Thankfully, I've been on this medicine for like a week and
[10761.67s -> 10763.23s]  after like
[10763.23s -> 10766.75s]  Eight to ten days. I don't think I'm gonna have to be taking it anymore
[10767.47s -> 10769.69s]  so
[10769.69s -> 10775.55s]  We'll go back to normal and probably like another four or five days. I would assume
[10775.99s -> 10782.76s]  We'll see. I don't know. Maybe I'll talk to my doctor and he might be maybe he says no you stay on it
[10782.76s -> 10786.09s]  I don't know but
[10786.29s -> 10792.50s]  See you guys tomorrow. We'll play the thing. I still have to do Parappa the Rapper and Parappa the Rapper 2 and
[10794.40s -> 10801.16s]  Talking about PlayStation 1 stuff. I have
[10801.68s -> 10810.96s]  Bushido blade and Bushido blade 2 so that should be a lot of fun those
[10810.96s -> 10830.46s]  I remember those games being a lot of fun. Those games are awesome. Dermacycle still not there. Not yet
[10831.02s -> 10835.33s]  When's Rhythm Heaven when I get a DS
[10836.77s -> 10847.29s]  That I can mess with or I'll find another way but let's go back to earlier we had sticks Renegade 250
[10847.63s -> 10851.03s]  When is Dead Rising?
[10851.03s -> 10853.27s]  After that, we've got the thing
[10854.11s -> 10860.22s]  However, I might not even beat the thing. I don't know if it depends on how it plays out
[10860.86s -> 10868.20s]  But the thing I've got Siren for PS2. We've got both the Parappa games
[10869.42s -> 10871.42s]  and Bushido blade and Bushido blade 2
[10871.42s -> 10872.54s]  after that
[10872.54s -> 10884.16s]  Then you're looking at probably Dead Rising and then after that we'll see I mean the Halloween stream is gonna happen somewhere in there, too
[10884.56s -> 10894.08s]  But sticks Renegade. Thanks in 250 any chance you play crash team racing one day nitro fueled
[10894.08s -> 10899.81s]  I know you like driving and games. I saw Vinny played and it was hilarious seeing him rage at the game
[10899.97s -> 10907.18s]  It's way better than Mario Kart. I have never played any of the games besides Sonic racing
[10907.30s -> 10911.56s]  I've never played any other racing game. That was not Mario Kart
[10912.32s -> 10921.36s]  Let me a cartoon racing game and everyone's played cruise in USA. I mean everyone has well Garfield cart was a joke
[10921.36s -> 10926.81s]  I played that for like 32 seconds Simpsons hit and run. That's not a racing game
[10926.93s -> 10942.36s]  That's like a GTA game. Every mission is a racing. Yeah, but it's not like a 3 2 1
[10942.84s -> 10947.34s]  Race the 12 people with you. It's not like a cartoon
[10948.06s -> 10954.63s]  Racing game where you race on tracks. It's that's that's like a Grand Theft Auto clone
[10954.63s -> 10957.75s]  I mean you can race in Grand Theft Auto
[10958.11s -> 10967.32s]  But Grand Theft Auto is not a like a cartoon racing game and you can do them there was a count
[10967.32s -> 10973.46s]  All right, but you guys know what I'm talking about. You know what I'm saying
[10973.46s -> 10985.90s]  I do good at least one person does two people do cart game. There you go. Thank you
[10985.90s -> 10995.30s]  But I don't know maybe time GTA game
[10995.34s -> 11001.43s]  Maybe one day if there's something to do nothing else to do or whatever if I don't have any plans or anything
[11001.47s -> 11005.58s]  But thank you sticks renegade. Thank you Elizabeth for the 250
[11005.66s -> 11009.46s]  So after having I'm jammer Lammy soundtrack on my mind since yesterday
[11009.46s -> 11015.62s]  I stumbled across that in stage six of the worst song in the concert hall with the weird green alien
[11015.62s -> 11022.18s]  It was actually changed for the US version of the game where in the US version your belt gets stuck on the door and you go
[11022.18s -> 11028.13s]  Back in time. However in the Japanese version you get hit by a car you die and go to hell
[11028.21s -> 11031.61s]  Yeah, I remember we were talking about that yesterday
[11031.89s -> 11046.89s]  Why is that such a I don't know why that's such a big deal for the US sensors that why that's weird of all the things
[11046.89s -> 11051.17s]  Like there's somebody like fucked up violent crazy games over here
[11051.17s -> 11066.25s]  That's the one that you know, you have to censor they wanted the US version to appeal to more younger kids
[11066.25s -> 11077.28s]  I guess yeah, but I don't know if I don't they like go to hell in a Teen Titans episode
[11077.44s -> 11083.84s]  Yeah, that pregnancy level really appealed to the kids
[11085.70s -> 11092.20s]  Right like what? Why is that the that's fucked? That's true. Yeah, that's fucked up
[11092.48s -> 11102.28s]  There's a Disneyland ride that ends with you going to hell
[11102.92s -> 11109.75s]  Almost every cartoon from the last hundred years as an episode with the devil or something. Yeah
[11110.81s -> 11117.33s]  Whatever, but yeah, thank you Elizabeth. Thank you. Toast fart for the 500 bits
[11118.05s -> 11127.83s]  Thank you, sir. Canine for the 300 bits. Jerma. I saw this in a recommended
[11128.35s -> 11131.87s]  So this isn't recommended on YouTube on one of your vids and I thought you'd find it funny
[11132.35s -> 11146.12s]  Let's find out what do you mean you found this isn't recommended you got a tenth of a second
[11146.60s -> 11152.30s]  This is a different YouTube link than the one from last night. Don't start this shit
[11154.38s -> 11157.29s]  Thank you rec records
[11158.09s -> 11163.10s]  Recor SED for the 250. Hey German inspired by the carnival stream. I went out and got this done
[11163.86s -> 11168.97s]  Thanks, Jeremy. Wait, you got a tat. This is tattoo
[11169.61s -> 11174.63s]  Are you serious? Hold on a second
[11174.71s -> 11179.43s]  Hold on a second. Wow
[11180.19s -> 11185.93s]  Why that the um, it's a little confused though
[11186.77s -> 11195.78s]  Because why did you get a you got a tattoo of me? That's weird. I mean like that's that's a tattoo of me
[11195.78s -> 11207.37s]  I mean, it's cool. I'm yeah, I'm showing it right now. I don't know why you got a tattoo of my face
[11207.93s -> 11225.81s]  That's actually a really like cool tattoo
[11234.17s -> 11236.17s]  EU date
[11236.89s -> 11242.65s]  That's great that's
[11242.65s -> 11244.65s]  That's I love it
[11244.73s -> 11251.66s]  That you know what? I love I love tattoos that are really just simple and like basic
[11252.38s -> 11253.50s]  tattoos
[11253.50s -> 11261.22s]  Because that you know, it's like it's like a small little piece, right? You know, I mean, I like the small tattoos the little ones
[11261.70s -> 11267.45s]  That just like you know, hey, look at that. I got that. Oh, wow, that's cool. Look at that
[11267.81s -> 11274.98s]  So it is a tattoo of you. I kind of walked into that one didn't I but it's alright
[11275.62s -> 11277.62s]  That's an awesome tattoo rec
[11277.78s -> 11287.28s]  Thank you for sharing it with everybody here and thank you for the 250 appreciate it cool tattoo
[11287.68s -> 11292.32s]  Thank you generate blue for the 300 bits. Hey, Jeremy
[11292.56s -> 11297.96s]  Just wanted to give you some bits for the quality entertainment you provide. Thank you the streams and thanks specifically
[11298.52s -> 11303.28s]  Especially for pulling back the starting time as it's severely easier to catch your streams now
[11303.28s -> 11305.92s]  Even if I got to go to work early the next day
[11306.52s -> 11308.52s]  Thank you for the 300 bits
[11309.28s -> 11314.38s]  Appreciate the kind message and yes, the reason why I pulled it back is because even I
[11315.14s -> 11318.94s]  started to see that as the streams obviously not this one, but
[11319.82s -> 11324.74s]  The average stream time has increased over the last couple years and moving to Pacific time
[11325.50s -> 11330.34s]  When a stream is six seven plus hours on average, it's
[11331.18s -> 11336.58s]  It gets so late for everybody else that I just I don't want people to have to stay up to like three or four o'clock
[11336.58s -> 11338.26s]  in the morning every time
[11338.30s -> 11340.27s]  so
[11340.27s -> 11352.18s]  They're like 1 to 2 p.m. Start. I think is a perfect time. I don't think I'm going to change the time of the stream
[11352.70s -> 11357.49s]  again
[11357.49s -> 11364.37s]  EST is crying. What do you mean? Yes, two three five o'clock six o'clock Eastern start and
[11366.17s -> 11368.17s]  That's like prime time in it
[11368.25s -> 11381.92s]  That's like, you know six seven p.m. We really get going. I used to start my streams at seven Eastern
[11382.20s -> 11390.01s]  Which was about four o'clock Pacific and then when I came over here it's a Vegas
[11390.53s -> 11397.80s]  It was I obviously was not gonna start seven Pacific because I would just be too late. I think for everybody
[11401.18s -> 11409.05s]  But yeah, I like it too. I think it's doing well and it'll stay but thank you generate blue
[11409.61s -> 11411.83s]  Thanks for watching the stream
[11411.83s -> 11417.49s]  Vilemi, thanks for the thousand bits ten dollars ending the stream because he's stinky

[11475.83s -> 11481.25s]  It's it was a fun one. It was just it was it was a just hanging out with my friends
[11484.99s -> 11490.27s]  Sometimes I have some of the most fun when I'm just chilling playing a game just talking about random stuff
[11490.71s -> 11494.81s]  I've been having a lot of fun on stream
[11495.25s -> 11498.83s]  Not that I wasn't having it before but I've been having like a ton of fun
[11499.47s -> 11509.18s]  The last like six months and like I said, it's not not even like oh, I wasn't you know, seven months ago
[11509.18s -> 11511.18s]  Wow, I really was I hate streaming
[11511.66s -> 11515.84s]  No, I think there's just been a lot of fun things going on recently
[11516.60s -> 11521.55s]  You ever get burnt out
[11521.55s -> 11526.36s]  Nope, because I take a lot of time off. That's by design
[11526.36s -> 11536.67s]  I take at least two days off a week at least two three days off a week to make sure that that doesn't happen
[11536.83s -> 11548.12s]  I mean for the most part do you this stream is live four times a week three or four times a week sometimes I
[11548.64s -> 11564.45s]  think it's important to take all time off not just to take care of stuff in your life, but
[11564.97s -> 11567.61s]  It lets you
[11567.61s -> 11577.37s]  Unplug a little and I can continue to have fun on this stream and go back and forth with you guys and have a good time
[11578.49s -> 11579.73s]  because
[11579.73s -> 11583.52s]  It's I have time to be away from it, too
[11584.08s -> 11595.46s]  You did how does it feel to die to third wheel?
[11596.18s -> 11613.96s]  So I I appreciate streaming more because I do it less and that's the way it's gonna be and that's the way it always
[11613.96s -> 11622.52s]  Will be but yeah, it's kind of the way it is
[11623.52s -> 11627.62s]  does hate it
[11627.62s -> 11633.33s]  No, I don't but thank you

[11702.53s -> 11704.76s]  I'm looking for the right image
[11704.76s -> 11709.84s]  Yeah, I said it's gonna be here, but I didn't say it'll be here tomorrow
[11710.52s -> 11730.37s]  Figs nice. That's all that's actually awesome. I can't wait to eat a fig or a fig spread maybe
[11730.37s -> 11732.74s]  I have to be careful though
[11732.90s -> 11741.58s]  Well, I'm done that home. I'm fine fig Newton's are the best cookies
[11741.58s -> 11749.22s]  I you know what here's the crazy thing fig Newton's are the best cookies that you never buy. I don't know
[11749.22s -> 11755.42s]  I what what what's what's with that? Why don't you just get them? I love fig Newton's, but I don't think I've ever purchased them
[11755.64s -> 11764.01s]  Don't ask me why you always get like the shitty cookies that you know that you're not gonna eat very many of but I would eat
[11764.01s -> 11770.41s]  The whole box of fig newtons then all right the next time I go to the grocery store
[11770.73s -> 11772.73s]  I'm going to buy fig Newton's
[11773.17s -> 11775.54s]  Or I'll do a 24-hour stream
[11775.98s -> 11792.28s]  How about that one and I'll eat one on stream just so you can know you can prove it, but thank you for let me for the
[11793.28s -> 11801.30s]  Thousand bits. Thank you. Tay for the 250. Hey German love tonight stream. Thanks for being here. Thanks for hanging out
[11801.66s -> 11808.54s]  Thanks to the 250 as well. Keith King. Thanks for the 250. Are you still planning on playing more Katamari games?
[11808.98s -> 11813.78s]  We love Katamari for the ps2 is my favorite game and I'd love to see my favorite streamer play it
[11814.46s -> 11817.06s]  Yes, I
[11817.06s -> 11819.90s]  At some point I'm gonna try to do
[11820.50s -> 11824.86s]  At least a couple more of the Katamari games because those streams are a lot of fun
[11824.86s -> 11830.17s]  I did the first one all in one stream, right? I think that's the only one I played
[11830.83s -> 11835.34s]  but that's another game that's fun just to play and just
[11836.02s -> 11843.80s]  Chill and hang out and just talk about random shit. So you'll see it again. I'll do more of the series
[11844.28s -> 11846.96s]  Because those games are really fun
[11846.96s -> 11854.03s]  Just not right now probably not till somewhere in like November or something because all of October is I've got a
[11854.59s -> 11856.59s]  Bunch of stuff that's just lined up ready to go

[11876.42s -> 11878.54s]  It's it can be
[11878.54s -> 11883.14s]  It can be a kind of hard to dance around
[11883.78s -> 11891.27s]  But you know, whatever do what you gotta do, thank you so much for the thousand bits appreciate it and
[11894.92s -> 11899.72s]  You know what that means. We've reached the end to our short trying stream
