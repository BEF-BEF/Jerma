[1.53s -> 14.39s]  The music stopped because I'm opening another game, as you know, as you are aware.
[19.26s -> 53.11s]  I'm gonna mute this one more time. Give me one sec. Okay, I need to change this. I gotta change the
[53.11s -> 67.82s]  game as well. Move you over. That looks better. That's better, right?
[69.32s -> 93.27s]  That looks good. So from last time, I was about to lose. Very, very, very awfully. My partner was
[93.27s -> 111.35s]  doing terrible. But let's see if I can do anything here. Here's my magic three. The yellow bar.
[112.07s -> 120.01s]  I'll get rid of the yellow bar. Ready? Check this out. Gone. Not even there. All right.
[120.01s -> 131.86s]  Updated load game. It was a single scenario. Which one was it? I have no idea. Timeline two.
[132.58s -> 147.11s]  Battle. Do we have times on these? We do. Is it conquerors? 530? No. 529. 530 at 2039.
[147.11s -> 156.97s]  530 at 1808. Original team timeline. There we go. Yeah. 2358. That's just before midnight.
[157.53s -> 168.70s]  I think this is it. Am I not playing Sam and Max? I just did. I completed season two. Now I need to
[168.70s -> 180.26s]  complete this. That is what we're doing today. All right, let's go here. I think this is it.
[180.26s -> 190.26s]  Let's see. So it was purple was doing nothing. Purple has like a dwarf in here, right?
[190.90s -> 198.70s]  I need to finish my losing camp. We have to get closure, but it's not lost yet. Remember,
[198.70s -> 204.98s]  I was wiping out people. I was taking people out left and right. He doesn't have very much
[204.98s -> 214.49s]  left. He has this. And that's it. Change the game. I already did. You need to refresh your browser.
[215.74s -> 223.16s]  Refresh your Twitch browser, please. It's not over yet. See, he's starting to build up a little
[223.16s -> 233.11s]  bit. Red is almost dead. So let's see what I can do. Let me try to remember what the plan.
[233.11s -> 238.54s]  I still have like good army. I'm going to be making money. I have tons of money. Let's go
[238.54s -> 244.42s]  down here. All right. Lots of money. What do I want to build? Behemoth lair. Let's build it.
[244.42s -> 258.22s]  I got the money. Oh, let's just start. Look, get him. Okay, we got a behemoth. I still can
[258.22s -> 268.33s]  move around here. What is this? This is the big one here. And then, yeah, not that well
[268.33s -> 274.38s]  defended. He only has like one castle that has anything in it. Two maybe, but if I can...
[280.38s -> 286.38s]  I just... I just need purple to do anything. All right, here we go. I'm going for it.
[288.01s -> 296.34s]  Like right here. Let me just take this. Everything's good down here.
[298.23s -> 310.94s]  New day. Did you actually just take that from purple? How is red still alive? I don't understand.
[312.39s -> 317.30s]  Like red sucks. I have to send somebody over here to do something about this because this
[317.30s -> 325.83s]  is all red has. They don't have anything else. Okay, what do we got? Let's build some more
[325.83s -> 341.75s]  stuff. Chris's goblin production. Orc tower. Upgrade the behemoth lair. Maybe. Just to have
[341.75s -> 351.45s]  better behemoths. What's the difference? Target enemy's defenses reduced by 80%. That's pretty
[351.45s -> 362.20s]  awesome. Curse that volume just a little. All right. Things are not looking bad. I have tons
[362.20s -> 366.04s]  of troop availability. I just need some money. Let's just even them out a little.
[368.07s -> 377.90s]  All right. You got several. Few, few, few, and few. He has... I don't... That's not enough.
[378.54s -> 390.01s]  That's not enough to get this. It's enough to get... I really should just go up here.
[390.73s -> 413.66s]  Or all the way up here. Well, just get all the resources. You're fucked. Yeah, I know. I know.
[413.66s -> 419.75s]  But still. It's still possible. Well, these guys are gonna run away. Give me this.
[420.71s -> 429.88s]  Several... I think I can do this. What do we got down here? Tons of fucking people to buy.
[430.68s -> 437.45s]  And I just go for it. All right. There's red. There's red. There's red. They're both out here
[437.45s -> 465.26s]  now. Come on. Go for it. Take something. Help me out here. Build. I already got this stuff.
[465.26s -> 471.58s]  Yeah. Just claim all the resources. The map is shit. That's the problem. I played a tough
[471.58s -> 478.89s]  game, but was able to use the map to my advantage to pull off an upset. Yeah. But it's
[478.89s -> 485.85s]  still possible. I can't just give up right now. I mean, this was such a good comeback.
[486.49s -> 491.88s]  I had such an opportunity. I can't. I'm like sunk cost fallacy right now.
[492.44s -> 502.12s]  I just gotta get somebody up there. Where's my nearest castle? Right here. Either right
[502.12s -> 507.54s]  there or right here. This is probably faster because it's a straight line. All right. What
[507.54s -> 512.31s]  can I do in here? I got plenty of fucking people next time. What about you? Let's go
[512.31s -> 524.38s]  with you. Several horde lots. What do you think I can do it? Think I can take this castle over
[524.38s -> 534.47s]  right now? What button do I press to hire all available units? I'll show you. So in here,
[535.11s -> 540.06s]  right here, this is a little castle building. You click it and it'll show you all available
[540.06s -> 547.45s]  that you can buy and you can just buy them all. No, I can't. I have to take like a...
[547.45s -> 559.75s]  What about this one? No. What about up here? These are easier to take. You know, just like
[559.75s -> 567.56s]  get over there. How far away is he? He's really fucking far away, isn't he? Yeah, he's like too
[567.56s -> 583.42s]  far away to do this. What do you have? Fuck. Is this a dead game? This might be dead.
[588.74s -> 597.93s]  You horde pack. Fuck. No, I was doing so well too. I'm playing it out. Here comes red.
[605.99s -> 610.22s]  Here. Which, what do I have here? All right. Let's get some units in here.
[610.94s -> 624.30s]  You have horde, horde. He has a lot, but horde of fairies is nothing. This should be okay.
[628.90s -> 632.90s]  I'll give this another few rounds and then decide if it's time to throw the towel in.
[633.62s -> 650.42s]  How do I get up here? I am claiming a bunch of shit, but it doesn't matter. They've...
[651.38s -> 662.41s]  Damn it. Here we go. They're coming in. I might be okay here. What's the most,
[662.41s -> 673.46s]  this is the most dangerous thing. This. I wonder if I should just fly out the dragon,
[673.46s -> 685.18s]  but probably not. I can't, no spells, no hero in here. 50 elementals. Yeah, but they have to get
[685.18s -> 695.53s]  in. I have one unit in double digits and it's the frog. Well, I'm not going to get out there
[695.53s -> 710.46s]  yet. Like, they can fly? No, they can't, can they? I mean, they can. I have like minotaurs
[710.46s -> 719.14s]  too. I should be all right once we... I mean, this is just one harpy here. Fuck, they can
[719.14s -> 733.66s]  fly. Yeah, this is bad. I don't have a hero to cast any spells. Hey, look at me. I'm gonna go over
[733.66s -> 752.82s]  here. They still have to get in. These are all powerful units. I think it's time for me to get
[752.82s -> 770.90s]  out here. He's just gonna fly in. I can kill these guys. There you are. Kill. I could go
[770.90s -> 774.02s]  out there and meet them on an open field. I'm not, I'm not gonna do that though.
[774.90s -> 791.62s]  Here they are at the front door. Just cheese them. Good, be the bait for the range attacks here.
[793.90s -> 805.50s]  Fuck, it's open. Well, they can get in now. I think I should just fly out here.
[811.29s -> 842.97s]  Stand like right here. Get down here. Nobody do anything. Get in the moat. Right in the moat.
[842.97s -> 857.69s]  Nice. Perfect. Come on. All right, where's my dragon? From this angle. Get him. I could
[857.69s -> 877.93s]  probably kill these in one or two hits. Get the dragon in the way. Come on. I don't want to fly
[877.93s -> 889.69s]  him out there. They're gonna get in. Block the entrance. This is not terrible. I'm okay with
[889.69s -> 913.11s]  this. It's all right. It's not over. This is the only unit that's really scary. Get rid of
[913.11s -> 927.26s]  this. No, come on. Good. Head down here. It doesn't matter. You're not gonna do shit.
[928.22s -> 933.54s]  Ah, fuck. I just blocked the angle. Completely. Go up here.
[934.50s -> 956.01s]  Chimera's gonna die. All right, come on. What do I have? 50? 12 to 20? They don't do that
[956.01s -> 982.34s]  much damage. Get in there. God damn it. Die. Why can't I shoot anybody from here? This sucks.
[983.30s -> 991.45s]  Out of ammo. Oh yeah. Well, unfortunately, this is going to be really, really close,
[991.45s -> 1011.99s]  but it's not going to be enough. It's game over. 50 of these things. Didn't have a hero in here.
[1013.27s -> 1020.49s]  Let's just fly. Just run away. Eventually I'm going to get hit by that arrow.
[1023.03s -> 1040.22s]  Yeah, eventually this will kill me. Yeah, I'm dead. Oh, this is so sad. Now this might be
[1040.22s -> 1055.32s]  unwinnable. Can I look at like stats? Can I see if they've done any damage to any other
[1055.32s -> 1083.08s]  player? Fucking 2v2 in the tavern. I want to see. Number of towns. Gold. Plenty of wood and ore.
[1091.70s -> 1104.94s]  Look at this shit. Attack is zero. Zero two two two. How can you not be there? How is it
[1104.94s -> 1118.31s]  possible? Can I steal this? Can I take his ore? Warrior human explorer builder. It's not
[1118.31s -> 1123.75s]  completely. I still have the one. I have this one really good army. I'm going to go for it.
[1124.39s -> 1128.55s]  Like fuck it. Let's just go for it. I'm going to stack units and then we're going to go.
[1133.11s -> 1143.14s]  Bone dragons. What has like the best? Let's see. You got good shit. All these places have
[1143.14s -> 1155.53s]  good shit, but I don't have money. I might as well just buy all this and then bring you down
[1155.53s -> 1165.98s]  there. Eventually the vampires will do work. Yeah, I just, I think I'm just overwhelmed at
[1165.98s -> 1178.97s]  this point. I don't think it's like possible. It was worth a shot. What the hell are you doing?
[1178.97s -> 1192.87s]  Because I need to go to here with you. So you got to get up there next turn.
[1193.59s -> 1204.82s]  Literally nothing. Although you are right next to it. More heroes can do more stuff.
[1204.82s -> 1210.71s]  Yeah, that's true. But it's remember it's 2v1 right now because purple ain't doing shit.
[1211.51s -> 1225.99s]  Purple's walking around in the circle picking up the same three resources. Can I get anything
[1225.99s -> 1238.58s]  from here? I guess I could just, just to take them. Take the unicorns. Just to have better
[1239.30s -> 1247.58s]  RV for now. I guess I could take these too. Just in case I run into somebody.
[1251.27s -> 1254.15s]  All right, anything else? So before I go up here and get some more vampires.
[1258.81s -> 1264.47s]  Guys, Dwarf's going to take this one. I'm going to get this one. Restock,
[1264.47s -> 1274.17s]  take over this one and see what happens. The vampires. Do they not? They don't have
[1274.17s -> 1299.27s]  upgraded vampires. How do you not have this? There are bone dragons here. Okay, next day.
[1302.09s -> 1316.86s]  What? Did he just take me on? I don't think he wins this. I'm gonna have to, okay,
[1316.86s -> 1325.06s]  I'm gonna have to do some, I don't have like ice arrow. Who's more dangerous?
[1326.49s -> 1331.91s]  Wyverns. Fuck. He has eight Wyverns. That's very bad.
[1331.91s -> 1350.84s]  Just hang out here for a second. What the fuck just happened? He just did Armageddon.
[1352.97s -> 1368.92s]  Come on. What? Everybody's dead. I had a chance. Hold on. Can I, let me just try and
[1368.92s -> 1384.98s]  take this out. It's not gonna happen. Is it? Come on. Kill it. I'm so defeated right now.
[1384.98s -> 1411.54s]  That sucks. I probably would have done it too. Yeah, there goes my other hero. Let's see what
[1411.54s -> 1429.40s]  purple's up to. I wonder. What did you do? Let me see. Nice, nice. So you walked from like
[1429.40s -> 1441.88s]  here to here. Cool. You better stack this fucking castle up. Now. Plan doesn't change.
[1441.88s -> 1452.28s]  We're still going to this castle. Jerma's angry already. I'm just remembering how
[1453.16s -> 1457.96s]  annoyed I was with my teammate. I know I'm like the salty boy after, you know,
[1458.68s -> 1473.74s]  you can't blame the teammate, but yes you can. You can. I'm sorry. I'm gonna drown here. I'm
[1473.74s -> 1480.38s]  gonna drown. He has to take something. Please take something. This is, I put like nine hours
[1480.38s -> 1489.90s]  into this campaign. I can't give up on it. Get over here right now. Come here. Give me all
[1489.90s -> 1499.00s]  your stuff. Give it to me. I can't take it from you. I can only give. I can't take. No,
[1499.00s -> 1504.25s]  no, no. I don't want to give you my fucking dragons. What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1504.25s -> 1522.42s]  no. What just happened? What did I just get in return? Split creatures. No, I, I can't. Oh,
[1522.42s -> 1538.07s]  my fucking God. It's okay. I just said one guy just said it's because my army is full
[1538.07s -> 1547.30s]  and now I just gave him my fucking angels. Somebody said it's because your army's full.
[1547.86s -> 1552.79s]  I've got to watch that stress. I, you just got the best fucking.
[1554.38s -> 1558.70s]  Uh, I, uh, why can I give, but I can't take from my ally? What if he's not going to give
[1558.70s -> 1568.89s]  to me from my fucking computer? You really close windows, select left hero,
[1569.45s -> 1579.06s]  and he's not going to do anything. He's going to take those units and walk around the circle
[1579.06s -> 1600.97s]  down here. Just don't press the check mark. Can I just exit? No, no, no. These, I needed
[1600.97s -> 1610.01s]  these so bad. I think that's, I think this is the point where I quit. I haven't saved in
[1610.01s -> 1637.48s]  a long time. When was the last auto safe? Let's see. Is this it? It is. Okay. Thank God.
[1643.11s -> 1647.59s]  Don't ever listen to Chad. No one's ever played this game. No, I mean, if it's a good,
[1647.59s -> 1664.20s]  it was a decent theory. The losing campaign continues. Yes, it does. All right. If I'm
[1664.20s -> 1671.02s]  going to lose, I'm going to lose. I'm not going to just quit. You got me to
[1671.02s -> 1674.54s]  download this game. Good. It's fantastic. I hope you enjoy it. It's a really,
[1674.54s -> 1683.78s]  really good game. He already owned that windmill and he touched it again. I hate this guy.
[1684.97s -> 1696.36s]  All right. Let's stock up again. Got more vampires. I'm going to leave the angels
[1696.36s -> 1713.72s]  because, uh, what do you think? Angels or, um, dendroids looks kind of good.
[1715.74s -> 1723.10s]  And here is my only hope. Are you ready? It's called turtle forever and just try to get like
[1723.82s -> 1742.97s]  15 dragons and like 150 vampires. I need to upgrade the skeletons though. That's my only shot.
[1743.61s -> 1747.29s]  Somebody's got to come out with these. This is like not a bad army either.
[1747.29s -> 1760.34s]  I'm making a new hero. Jeremy, you already made this Australia joke.
[1760.34s -> 1767.13s]  Well, at this point, it's not a joke. It's real life. I'm living in reality right now.
[1767.13s -> 1777.74s]  They're coming for me and I'm not going to, I'm not going to go down. Winners don't turtle.
[1778.62s -> 1791.02s]  All right. So I want, uh, this one upgrade the skeleton. I have already upgraded. I need to do
[1791.02s -> 1799.16s]  this. What do I need for that? Dragon vault. I already have dread nights. All right. Dragon
[1799.16s -> 1808.26s]  vault, 15,000 gold. We're doing it. Let's just save the money while we have the second here.
[1808.26s -> 1814.09s]  Let's get a new hero because there are, uh, ancient behemoths that are here now.
[1814.73s -> 1828.49s]  Okay. We need resource silo, freelance goblin barracks, ogre fort, escape tunnel.
[1829.37s -> 1844.84s]  No, let's just get a hero. I mean, yeah, I really, it needs to be this person.
[1845.56s -> 1849.45s]  Okay. You hang out there for now. I'm going to get you an army too.
[1850.98s -> 1855.22s]  You take this because no one has even secured it. What the fuck are they thinking?
[1855.86s -> 1870.78s]  I got the new spell. I'm ready. They're all working together. This is,
[1870.78s -> 1875.56s]  he has so many heroes. He doesn't know what to do with it. This one just stood still.
[1876.20s -> 1881.61s]  He has like 12 heroes across two players and now they're coming for me.
[1884.62s -> 1891.64s]  No, what do you have? Uh, I don't think it's possible to defend this pack of,
[1892.62s -> 1897.88s]  uh, God damn it. That's when I think I'm, I get a minute to breathe.
[1899.10s -> 1905.62s]  Well, I'm going to try. I'm going to try to defend it with my level one hero.
[1907.14s -> 1916.22s]  Ah, two more days through until a new week. What do you got? Lots of this game.
[1920.57s -> 1929.42s]  I don't think I'm going to be able to do this one. I need like a final battle though,
[1929.42s -> 1935.18s]  just so I can say that I completed it. It was game over two hours ago. Yeah, I know,
[1935.18s -> 1937.82s]  but I just had to see it again because I left really abruptly.
[1939.96s -> 1965.30s]  You come with your firebirds. The behemoths didn't do anything.
[1966.10s -> 1969.70s]  No, this is just embarrassing. Really? Yeah. At least I'm trying, right?
[1970.58s -> 1981.69s]  Start a new map. Um, I don't think so. I think I'm going to hold onto that because starting
[1981.69s -> 1985.29s]  because then we'll, the same situation will happen. I'll get like a quarter of the way
[1985.29s -> 1989.86s]  through a map. I'd rather do like a full, like seven to 10 hours stream of the game
[1990.58s -> 1994.58s]  rather than play it for like another hour or two on a new map and then we save it
[1994.58s -> 2000.04s]  and it disappears for two weeks. Tomorrow is cooking simulators. We're not doing it tomorrow.
[2000.76s -> 2014.60s]  I may as well just die. Do a real cooking stream.
[2016.47s -> 2020.71s]  Worth mentioning that this is three nine, three dollars and 39 cents right now on good old games.
[2020.71s -> 2026.14s]  Just get it. This is less than a fucking medium coffee at Starbucks. Go get this game.
[2027.66s -> 2041.72s]  Seriously. Unfortunately, the first stream I did, the game I think was 10 bucks
[2047.62s -> 2051.67s]  and this is where we lose. I need one more big battle.
[2052.39s -> 2056.15s]  There's going to be one more big battle that I have to at least go out with.
[2056.71s -> 2063.03s]  You know, I can't just let, I can't just lose. I'm sticking my tongue out at them while they rush.
[2063.59s -> 2070.22s]  I got it because I saw you playing it. Yeah. It's very interesting.
[2072.10s -> 2078.92s]  It's a very, very fun chill game. Big one sided battle. I don't think so. Next,
[2078.92s -> 2082.44s]  this next week here, I'm going to, I'm taking off and we're going to see what we can do
[2082.44s -> 2095.82s]  with upgraded bone dragons. I'll take six of them. Jeremy needs to get spanked hard
[2095.82s -> 2101.74s]  before he goes to his room for good. No, you're talking about like in the getting
[2101.74s -> 2107.98s]  beat in the game. Oh my God. What the fuck. All right. It's almost time to go out here.
[2107.98s -> 2116.15s]  I still live in the castle. Podcast listener just gave 50 dollars.
[2119.91s -> 2127.45s]  Podcast listener. Thank you for the 50 bucks. 5,000 bits. Love your streams, dude. Thanks for
[2127.45s -> 2135.24s]  everything you do. German heart. Much love back to you. Thank you for 50 fucking dollars.
[2135.24s -> 2151.90s]  5,000 bits. Podcast listener. Thank you so much. A lot of money. 5,000 this lot.
[2151.90s -> 2154.86s]  There was, they've been like three or four of these tonight. Thank you guys.
[2155.58s -> 2169.38s]  Twitch added a reward system. They did. What do you mean reward system? You get like bits
[2169.38s -> 2173.80s]  or something. What does that mean? I don't know what it means. All right. Here comes the next
[2173.80s -> 2185.78s]  week. I'm ready to move. I'm going to, I'm going to fucking explode here. I had to go
[2185.78s -> 2193.10s]  out with a bang. I have to take somebody with me and like part of me is like actually
[2193.10s -> 2201.08s]  thinking about declaring war on purple and killing him. Can I do that? Is that possible?
[2201.72s -> 2215.64s]  Can I? Is there a way? Did purple go through the same portal loop three times? Probably.
[2221.21s -> 2235.10s]  System option scenario info. Is there declare war? No, I can't declare war. That's
[2235.10s -> 2247.59s]  unfortunate. All right, here we go. Two more dragons. Four more of these.
[2249.11s -> 2258.47s]  Eight more of these. I should have a substantial army at this point. Some more skeletons.
[2259.03s -> 2262.07s]  And then we're going to upgrade the dragons and then we're going to get the hell out of here
[2262.07s -> 2278.10s]  and I'm going to just steamroll somebody. Mow the lawn IRL. I'm not sure you're aware
[2278.10s -> 2283.72s]  of this, but there are really, there's not really much thing as a lawn in Las Vegas.
[2284.36s -> 2302.44s]  It'd be mold of rocks. Hey, let's do it again. Back to bed. Rake the sand. What do I need?
[2302.44s -> 2309.30s]  10,000? 15,000? I think he just took something from me.
[2323.86s -> 2337.72s]  Damn. Damn it. Okay, here we go. Dragon vault. There it is. Now I need to wait
[2337.72s -> 2349.48s]  one more day. I may as well just wait the whole week. What did he just do that for?
[2353.50s -> 2357.82s]  He's just playing with portals now. He just did the portal infinite loop thing for fun.
[2358.46s -> 2371.46s]  Five super dragons. Look, let's just wait the whole week. I'm just waiting the whole
[2371.46s -> 2387.93s]  week. Who cares? I already lost. It doesn't matter. I don't care about this. Nothing
[2387.93s -> 2394.95s]  matters. Don't even give him satisfaction. Run through the escape hole. What is this?
[2395.83s -> 2421.29s]  No. Turn on auto combat. I can't even surrender. There's no one to surrender. Hey,
[2421.29s -> 2433.08s]  at least I took out one of their sand wind people. This is sad. Sad. It's okay. At least
[2433.08s -> 2440.20s]  I've saw to its completion. That's all I care about. Here's what I will be really mad about
[2440.20s -> 2448.07s]  though. If I lose before purple does, that's what's gonna happen. That's so I'm gonna be,
[2448.07s -> 2460.82s]  I'm gonna go to sleep tonight angry. I'm not supposed to get angry. What does purple have?
[2460.82s -> 2474.94s]  Purple has like two castles and like two or three heroes. What does purple have? Does
[2474.94s -> 2479.74s]  purple even have a house? Yeah, look, he's, I mean, doesn't have shit, but still. Oh,
[2479.74s -> 2484.71s]  here we go. Yes, I could stop this right now, but I'm not going to want him to die.
[2485.59s -> 2492.28s]  Just so I can at least be the one that survived. Let's watch this one boys and girls and see how
[2492.28s -> 2517.77s]  this happens. No, you're not going to do it. Habitage. All right. This is the end. Eight
[2518.49s -> 2525.85s]  ghost dragons. 29. I gotta wait to get some more vampires. We're gonna wait.
[2526.57s -> 2532.68s]  Here's the thing though. This really might be really powerful and I might kill these two
[2532.68s -> 2552.49s]  or three of their heroes and then I'll die. It's okay. At least I'll die going down.
[2553.62s -> 2559.59s]  Wait, no, at least I'll fight. I'll take them on. Whatever you, what I'm trying to say is just,
[2559.59s -> 2585.11s]  give me another week. Yeah, I'm gonna sell them. Sell, sell everything. Sell all. Marketplace.
[2585.11s -> 2592.12s]  Where's the marketplace here? All right. This is, I don't want to do this, but I am.
[2592.12s -> 2596.06s]  Sell it all. Wait, what do I need for the dragons? I already have as many as I can get.
[2596.86s -> 2604.71s]  Sell. Who cares? We'll clean it out. The coffer is here.
[2617.78s -> 2631.42s]  78. All right. What? Anything else? I got $10,000. Should I get? All right. Chad, listen to me here.
[2631.42s -> 2648.76s]  Unicorns or 60 whites? I can up, what do you think? Super whites? Unicorns or 60 upgraded
[2648.76s -> 2665.86s]  whites? Let's see what they look like. 3 to 5, 18 health. 18 to 22, 90. There's only four
[2665.86s -> 2678.73s]  unicorns. Yeah. All right. Last week. One more day. Somebody said, what a disaster.
[2680.97s -> 2687.62s]  It's all right. We're just, we're just chilling. We're just having fun.
[2687.62s -> 2693.61s]  We're just hanging out. Thanks, purple. He noticed I had zero in everything.
[2694.33s -> 2702.90s]  You know, it'd be really great if you did anything else besides give me like
[2702.90s -> 2710.78s]  10 of each resource. All right. Drain's enemy mana. Undead. Regenerating.
[2712.38s -> 2723.16s]  Aura of magic resistance. Blinding attack. Hates devils. This is it. This is the team.
[2723.80s -> 2742.15s]  I'm ready to go. Where do I go first? All right. You decide. Where are we going?
[2743.19s -> 2746.23s]  Top left, top right, bottom right, or bottom left? Which one?
[2752.81s -> 2764.63s]  Stay put. Wait, you want me just to sit here? Stay put? Hold. I have to get out of here.
[2766.46s -> 2772.26s]  You want me to stay? I can't just stay here. It's never going to end.
[2772.82s -> 2776.26s]  They're never going to stop running around and collecting resources.
[2790.70s -> 2796.38s]  No, I got to go. I got to go. They won't even come over here. I have to go to them.
[2796.38s -> 2802.17s]  They're never going to come over here. I'm going. Getting 999 skeletons. That's going to
[2802.17s -> 2812.38s]  take fucking like seven more months. I'm going. First course of action is top right,
[2812.38s -> 2822.82s]  I think. Middle right. We're taking this. Let's go. I'm not fucking, I don't care
[2822.82s -> 2834.20s]  if I lose my capital. I'll get one. Top right? I mean, that's where we're going.
[2840.14s -> 2861.96s]  Right here. I'll take this. We're in Orange's world. Yeah. We are in an orange world. And
[2861.96s -> 2867.11s]  then I'm going in this thing. And wherever that ends up, whatever. Here comes a battle.
[2873.05s -> 2878.89s]  There he goes. Just waiting for me to leave. Purple's dead. That was very anti-climactic.
[2885.58s -> 2890.86s]  Purple, I think, officially is dead. They don't have anything. You have one hero,
[2890.86s -> 2901.03s]  I think, right? That's all you got. This dumb motherfucker still has default skeletons.
[2901.03s -> 2914.34s]  I hate this guy. Might as well go with a fighter. It doesn't matter. I'm going to get your
[2914.34s -> 2924.57s]  castle anyways. Did more than you. No, he didn't. No, he didn't. All right. Well,
[2924.57s -> 2929.74s]  you don't even. What's earthquake? This earthquake. Do I have earthquake?
[2930.38s -> 2938.50s]  I'm getting a meteor shower. Sacrifice. Armageddon. Clone. No, what are we going
[2938.50s -> 2946.60s]  to do? Fucking meteor shower. Right here. Right here. Right in the middle. I think so.
[2948.34s -> 2966.98s]  Get free people with it. Oh, boy. You get stronger every day. Come on out here. One hit.
[2969.74s -> 2982.58s]  Let's go right here. Is that open yet? This is open, right? We're opening. I can't go
[2982.58s -> 3001.82s]  into the moat. Thank you for coming out. Easy. Casual. He's expecting the AI to carry him. No,
[3001.82s -> 3006.94s]  I'm expecting the AI to get out of the backpack that's on my back.
[3008.23s -> 3016.57s]  Just weighing me down. He curled up into a ball and he's just in my suitcase.
[3017.13s -> 3031.62s]  Let's get in here. Done deal. Castle's mine. And then, okay, that's it. I'm going to get
[3031.62s -> 3041.03s]  his artifact. Oh, fuck. Ballistics. Two aim shots at max damage or rearrange troops. Two aim shots.
[3042.17s -> 3068.76s]  Mine. Okay, good. Now it begins. No. Top left. Here we go. Okay, I don't think I can take
[3068.76s -> 3075.34s]  this. Yes, I can. Oh, fuck yeah. I'm going to take them both. Pack, pack, few, pack.
[3075.98s -> 3089.56s]  Defend the capital. I don't even need to defend the capital. It doesn't matter. They're dead
[3089.56s -> 3106.71s]  anyways. Pack, pack, few, pack, pack, pack. Just fly. Just cause damage. I'm back. Is
[3106.71s -> 3121.13s]  Purple still alive? Yes, but not for long. You need multiple heroes? Yeah, I know. It's
[3121.13s -> 3132.23s]  just too late for that. I have really nothing. I thought I had multiple heroes when I had a
[3132.23s -> 3149.98s]  friend of mine playing. I didn't mean to gag myself. This guy doesn't do anything. You
[3149.98s -> 3163.77s]  may as well just do the chef. Kill the dragon. At least kill one of these dragons. You can do
[3163.77s -> 3180.90s]  it. You're so bad. Worst unit in the game. He's getting toxic. It's not even good. It's
[3180.90s -> 3188.26s]  a bad unit. It's not even a good unit. No, it's the starting... I was the wrong
[3188.26s -> 3193.45s]  character to start with. This player's not even good. This guy's not even good. I just
[3193.45s -> 3202.89s]  picked the wrong starting hero. This guy's not even good. It's really annoying. I should
[3202.89s -> 3205.29s]  have fucking won. I picked the wrong fucking hero in the beginning. This guy's not even
[3205.29s -> 3219.00s]  good at the game. You don't have a friend like that that you play games with or you
[3219.00s -> 3223.62s]  played games with and every time that they died, it was always like... No, this game's
[3223.62s -> 3238.84s]  bad. That guy's bad. I am that friend. All right, here we go. Let's go. I need music for
[3238.84s -> 3250.49s]  this. Good music. Hold on. I gotta get pumped up. No, not Doom. It's gotta be like epic
[3250.49s -> 3274.30s]  fantasy music. Not Benny Hill. Does this have a song? It does have a song, doesn't
[3274.30s -> 3278.39s]  it? All right, I'm gonna be quiet and you're gonna be able to watch the epic
[3278.39s -> 3358.07s]  battle, okay? Does Matt just pretend you're watching a movie? Where's that guy from?
[3358.07s -> 3411.38s]  Was that guy in the last movie? What's that guy's name? Fuck off! Hello? No, I'm
[3411.38s -> 3419.94s]  in a movie. Yeah, it's like this fantasy movie. It sucks. Put that phone down! Oh,
[3419.94s -> 3433.69s]  no, I'll call you back. Fucking dickhead! You threw fucking popcorn at me,
[3433.69s -> 3440.70s]  motherfucker? What did I do? Sit the fuck down. Fuck out of here, fucking idiot.
[3441.58s -> 3463.66s]  Somebody get security! Get away from him! Get him out of here. Get him out of my
[3463.66s -> 3468.57s]  fucking mouth. He hit me right in the fucking mouth. Piece of shit. He threw a whole bag of
[3468.57s -> 3473.94s]  popcorn at my fucking friend. No, I don't want you to take my name. I don't want you to take
[3473.94s -> 3483.22s]  my fucking name. No, you don't need my name. This is like the best part of the movie.
[3483.78s -> 3508.01s]  I won. I did it! All right, now get my stream not claimed, please. I didn't even
[3508.01s -> 3521.61s]  lose anybody, either. Let's go. Have you ever had a girlfriend? Yeah, I got one right
[3521.61s -> 3533.80s]  now. We're in Ips camp. Is there an after credit scene? Where am I? Oh, he's coming for the
[3533.80s -> 3551.74s]  house. We've rested up. Any replacements? I think we can go down. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.
[3551.74s -> 3561.69s]  Unbelievable. I have a girlfriend, but she goes to another school. I mean, that's a classic.
[3568.06s -> 3570.86s]  Just I want you to keep in mind something very important. Just look at this.
[3571.50s -> 3575.88s]  Where was that? Was it down here? You need to see this. This is fucking so important.
[3575.88s -> 3584.17s]  I'm about to throw a bag of popcorn. Where is he? This purple is just standing and they walk
[3584.17s -> 3604.52s]  to buy him. Where is he? There he is. Red walked by him. Isn't it like seven days and
[3604.52s -> 3631.02s]  you automatically die of starvation? Why is he still alive? I can't understand.
[3631.02s -> 3635.50s]  Your unintelligible Boston accent speak more clearly. Fuck are you talking about?
[3636.46s -> 3644.65s]  It's another castle. What's that? I'll take another one, please.
[3645.45s -> 3690.95s]  What is this music? Oh, it's the castle. Turn off teleport if you do another game. Yeah,
[3694.10s -> 3705.35s]  this was the random map. Everything random test. So it's cool. I actually probably
[3705.35s -> 3708.07s]  rather play one of the scenarios just because remember when we first started this?
[3708.87s -> 3713.27s]  There was random shit everywhere. Almost like as if it wasn't supposed to be where it was.
[3713.99s -> 3720.97s]  Well, here we go. I get punched in the face in this movie too.
[3731.22s -> 3737.99s]  There we go. I fixed it. Okay, I'm thinking we got eight versus nine. Same dragon,
[3739.96s -> 3750.50s]  but not anymore. Tell those vampires. I feel like I kind of need to just get in here,
[3750.50s -> 3758.87s]  but this is my strongest unit. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I have
[3758.87s -> 3766.81s]  no idea. I have absolutely no idea. No idea what to do. I get going to get the first hit.
[3769.24s -> 3791.26s]  Going in. Fuck it. Get in. Everybody get in. Get in. Is my microphone? No, it's not.
[3800.31s -> 3809.59s]  Save the dragons, please. God. No, the dragons can't be saved.
[3810.23s -> 3816.09s]  I'm trying to keep the vampires alive. Those are the ones that I think actually really
[3816.09s -> 3842.86s]  matter here. Ah, that hurts. Sorrow? Stone skin? Bloodlust? I think so. Save him. You're a
[3842.86s -> 3848.25s]  heartless owner. He's gonna be fine. I need him to take hits and be able to take out the
[3848.25s -> 3861.10s]  dragons. He's doing very, very good. Okay, angel. Angel's gonna die here. No, that means
[3861.10s -> 3868.18s]  like a super crit. Okay, I had to get rid of them first. Can I make it in here? I don't
[3868.18s -> 3879.21s]  think I can. I can't really get over that. Can I walk over this? I have to. She's dead.
[3879.85s -> 3902.25s]  Notice people have blood that I can steal. This is game over.
[3903.61s -> 3906.09s]  The vampires can't drain any light because there's no light to drain.
[3907.37s -> 3934.66s]  No, not yet. It's not a complete lost cause yet. Get in. Get inside. It's unbelievable. All
[3934.66s -> 3943.90s]  right. Um, clone, frost ring, anti-magic. I'm thinking what's death ripple? Sends a wave of
[3943.90s -> 3946.54s]  death across the battlefield, which damage is all non-undead. Everyone's undead here.
[3947.78s -> 3963.86s]  Ice bolt. Onto them. Decent. That's decent. I'm gonna beat it. I'm gonna do it, right?
[3963.86s -> 3977.50s]  Yeah, I am. But what did it cost? What did it cost? We already had one.
[3977.50s -> 3991.46s]  I just ripped my shirt way more than it was. This is ridiculous now. Now this has to go into
[3991.46s -> 4002.98s]  like the garbage. Did you guys hear that? This is now like a piece of spaghetti around my neck.
[4004.39s -> 4015.13s]  No! It really, I can't like save it either. I just grabbed it like fucking idiot.
[4023.34s -> 4027.18s]  No, I have to like, I have to stitch, but if I stitch it together, the fibers are going to
[4027.18s -> 4039.48s]  be all screwed up. Is this premium? No, this is not a premium. This is not a
[4040.52s -> 4044.36s]  $20 premium t-shirt that you can get from the German 95 Teespring store.
[4044.36s -> 4067.78s]  $20 for a premium shirt. This is just a Hanes. I killed the dragon.
[4071.54s -> 4076.26s]  It doesn't matter. I'm like, I'm not going to win this. I'm going to win like this
[4076.26s -> 4083.72s]  match, but am I going to look at the fucking units I have. It doesn't matter. It's fine.
[4084.36s -> 4097.56s]  I'm like, there we go. I got 12,000 experience. Basic learning, basic error. Hey, I did it.
[4098.78s -> 4106.50s]  This is my original home. I have five vampires. I took my home back. That's all I care about.
[4107.14s -> 4119.35s]  And I'm going to go take this one too. Did you make ads for the Teespring so that
[4119.35s -> 4126.86s]  you can play it when chat asks for ads? Yeah, that's true. Every time you guys ask
[4126.86s -> 4133.10s]  for an ad, I'm just going to tell you about my t-shirt. Holy shit. 37 of these. This is
[4133.10s -> 4151.38s]  the real end here. That's too many. Is this the same castle? You'll never take me alive.
[4152.68s -> 4184.30s]  I'll blow this place to kingdom come before I go with you. What is that? I got to do my last
[4185.18s -> 4191.13s]  I'm still standing and everyone's watching. They have the respect and they have the
[4191.13s -> 4196.73s]  dignity to let me at my own dignity and my own free will go out of the castle
[4197.37s -> 4223.05s]  and have my final stand. Purple lived. Purple lived without a house just walking around.
[4224.17s -> 4230.57s]  That's the third time I've lost my fucking head. I want to see stats from that game.
[4230.57s -> 4245.11s]  Show me stats. I want to see the after the game scores. Bad military leader. Yeah,
[4245.11s -> 4253.38s]  it's all right though. Go to the autosave and look at the tavern. What do you mean?
[4255.03s -> 4271.96s]  Uh, no. Back, back, back. Autosave and look at the tavern. The tavern where? Uh, what about it?
[4276.65s -> 4290.44s]  Oh, you're talking about here. Yeah, he didn't do anything. He got the most wood. I was number of
[4290.44s -> 4298.17s]  towns. Goal. I was up here. I would have been up here. He just collected resources and sent
[4298.17s -> 4305.48s]  them to me sometimes in the mail. Yeah, I don't have the best hero because my hero's dead.
[4305.48s -> 4317.34s]  He just died. See that the game doesn't even think that I have a 10, 3, 6, 9 hero. How about
[4317.34s -> 4332.09s]  doing triple time? Second place against the AI. Yeah, this is a hard game. It's a hard game.
[4332.73s -> 4342.28s]  Fake wood more than one hero. I had, I had like three or four heroes in the first like four
[4342.28s -> 4347.98s]  hours of this campaign. I did. Purple just was in a fucking luggage and I was storing
[4347.98s -> 4366.12s]  them overhead all day. I need to worry about my own luggage. Streamer eats four gyros? Oh god,
[4366.76s -> 4372.36s]  it's not a real Heroes of Might and Magic 3 stream. It's not eight hours. No, I can't
[4372.36s -> 4389.06s]  do that today. We're coming back slow during a colon. Here we go. He, he's gonna say it.
[4389.70s -> 4394.10s]  He's about to say, he's gonna say it. He's about to say it. No, no, no, don't say,
[4394.18s -> 4402.90s]  don't, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't do it. Guys, that's gonna be the...
[4406.26s -> 4419.77s]  I paused the stream. Did he say, did he say it? Did he? I paused it. I'm gonna unpause. I hope
[4419.77s -> 4445.51s]  he doesn't say it. End of the stream. No! He did it. Don't do that. Nah, yeah, I'm,
[4445.67s -> 4451.22s]  I need to ease back into this. I've already been supposed to take it easy today and I,
[4451.22s -> 4456.52s]  like, was screaming and yelling. I just can't have a fucking, I can't have, like, a calm stream.
[4458.30s -> 4462.95s]  I just can't. I don't know what it is. Every time I say, oh, I'm gonna play Shaman
[4462.95s -> 4472.54s]  Vax for an episode and then do it, I always end up screaming. Is there a way that I can
[4472.54s -> 4480.14s]  just, like, not get high energy? I'm just gonna eat, like, a bunch of pasta before
[4480.14s -> 4491.58s]  my next comfy stream so I don't, like, do make any noises. Get a lobotomy. Whoa.
[4493.56s -> 4500.26s]  Nah, I'm kidding around. But for real, colonoscopy went well. We cleaned up some stuff. I just kind
[4500.26s -> 4504.66s]  of want to have a chill day today and scream and make noises and be very loud and scream some
[4504.66s -> 4510.55s]  more. Tomorrow is Cooking Simulator. That's gonna be a fun one. I can't wait. I've been
[4510.55s -> 4527.30s]  really looking forward to it. Hope you enjoy it. Tomorrow, regular time, same place, same
[4527.30s -> 4536.23s]  network. Thank you, everybody, for watching. He hates it. No, no. Have you seen the trailer?
[4536.79s -> 4543.96s]  It looks very detailed and very fun. It's like House Flipper but only in the kitchen
[4544.95s -> 4552.76s]  and you only cook food. It's very detailed. I think you're gonna like it. But take care
[4552.76s -> 4557.85s]  of yourselves. We're gonna do the bits and everything. Not quite ready to leave. It's
[4557.85s -> 4561.77s]  not like House Flipper at all. Well, I'm just saying it's one of those, like, simulation
[4561.77s -> 4575.22s]  kind of... you'll see. You'll see. That's what we're gonna call it. Why is Sam and Max still up?
[4575.22s -> 4582.81s]  That was incorrect. But let's do the bits and the subs. If you've taken off, hopefully we see
[4582.81s -> 4587.40s]  you soon. Maybe tomorrow or the next day. Normal time tomorrow. We have between three and
[4587.40s -> 4596.94s]  four pacific. Hopefully see you there. So let us rewind five hours to the beginning of the
[4596.94s -> 4602.23s]  stream. Let's go over some of these bits. What do you say? Am I gonna play Layers of
[4602.23s -> 4613.94s]  Fear 2? I don't know. I really don't know. I've seen such wild mixed things about it.
[4615.02s -> 4621.02s]  I've heard it's really awful and not in, like, a fun, funny way. Just not fun and not good at all.
[4621.58s -> 4626.70s]  And then I've heard, no, it's actually pretty great. It's so mixed. I don't even know
[4627.42s -> 4635.72s]  what I want to do. But it seems like it doesn't really have great response so far.
[4636.52s -> 4651.83s]  What are we talking about? Layers of Fear 2. He hates it. Hey, thank you to Atrolux8trucks
[4651.83s -> 4658.84s]  for the 250. They say Pride 100. Pride 100. Pride 50. We fucking love you, Jerma. Those new meds.
[4659.80s -> 4668.58s]  Huh. You can do this. P.S. Happy Pride Month. Happy Pride Month. Those new meds.
[4669.46s -> 4674.73s]  We fucking love you, Jerma. Those new meds. I did get new medication for my,
[4675.53s -> 4680.94s]  I was gonna say my bum, but that's what it is. What am I gonna pretend that's not what it is?
[4685.00s -> 4687.24s]  Uh, it's, it is a little weird. I'm trying to get used to it.
[4688.12s -> 4699.06s]  But we'll see. Thank you so much for the 250. Really appreciate it. Marvosh Magali,
[4699.06s -> 4703.88s]  thanks for the 250. Hi, Jerma. I missed quite a lot of streams. The only VOD I watched was
[4703.88s -> 4708.84s]  the Talk to Transformer one, and that got me in tears. Glad the colonoscopy went good.
[4709.56s -> 4715.32s]  Did your mum enjoy the tour? Take care. Yes. My mother had a great time here.
[4716.20s -> 4727.80s]  When she was here last month. It was a great time. It was great to see my mother. She's
[4727.80s -> 4736.14s]  wonderful. Hopefully I see her again soon. And yeah, the colonoscopy did, it went well,
[4736.14s -> 4740.70s]  from my understanding. There's still tissue that's being examined. I have to wait a few
[4740.70s -> 4745.74s]  weeks. That's how long it takes the biopsies to come back. But I was told that there are
[4745.74s -> 4753.66s]  no major concerns, but in a few weeks I will know for sure. There's some tissue still
[4753.66s -> 4764.73s]  being examined. Colon tour. It's just a long tube. Am I gonna stream E3? Yes. I'm going to do
[4765.69s -> 4768.25s]  the same thing that I did last year and do the major conferences.
[4769.05s -> 4777.51s]  So you can expect that? Absolutely. But thank you Marvosh Magali. Thank you
[4777.51s -> 4783.90s]  Daft Skeletor for the $15. There's no message here, but 15 bucks is a large drop of money.
[4783.90s -> 4796.22s]  Thank you. Appreciate the $15. Thank you so much. What were the minor concerns?
[4797.02s -> 4802.70s]  Uh, I mean I have irritable bowel disease. I've had like colitis for 15 years almost,
[4802.70s -> 4809.10s]  12 years at this point. Since I was like 24, 23. It's been almost like, no it's been like
[4809.10s -> 4823.62s]  10 years. Something like that. So I still have those problems. It's just I've never had a full
[4823.62s -> 4830.38s]  colonoscopy before. I've had sigmoidoscopies, which is the same thing except they don't go
[4831.02s -> 4840.94s]  as far in. So yeah, there's IBS and there's IBD. IBS is irritable bowel syndrome.
[4840.94s -> 4845.82s]  IBD is irritable bowel disease. I will have it for the rest of my life. You cannot get rid of
[4845.82s -> 4856.86s]  it. So that's just the way it is. So I have to be a lot more conscious of my intestinal
[4856.86s -> 4861.14s]  and gastro health. So that's why a lot of people were asking. I know we talked about
[4861.14s -> 4866.17s]  this in the beginning of the stream, but some of you may not have been here. I have to be screened
[4867.99s -> 4878.54s]  earlier just because of all the gastro issues that I do have. So and I was having a couple
[4878.54s -> 4882.22s]  of symptoms that I didn't really have an explanation for. So we went down the path of
[4882.22s -> 4888.30s]  just getting it done now. There you go. But thank you for the $15. Daffskeletor. Thank you
[4888.30s -> 4894.28s]  C4G for the $5. Jerma, I'm begging you do a dollar on high stream. Maybe when chapter five
[4894.28s -> 4900.84s]  comes out on Thursday. No, I can't play those games in front of people because I make like
[4900.84s -> 4905.64s]  decisions that are so bad probably and aren't like completely correct and everyone would just
[4905.64s -> 4909.40s]  make fun of me. You try to tell me that if I like had lethal and I missed it,
[4910.36s -> 4917.08s]  the chat wouldn't be like making tons of fun of me and stuff. No, I know that I don't
[4917.08s -> 4926.25s]  know how to play well. I don't want to be told that. I already know it. I do everything
[4926.25s -> 4934.42s]  so incorrectly that you guys would send me to the guillotine if I streamed that game.
[4937.96s -> 4946.94s]  Talking about Hearthstone. Not only do I miss lethal, but sometimes I do wrong trades and then
[4946.94s -> 4953.03s]  I go oops, oh it's okay. I'll just do the spell to him next time. And it's completely
[4953.03s -> 4964.28s]  incorrect, but it still works. I'm the kind of person that does like the deal two damage
[4964.28s -> 4970.28s]  to an enemy to the hero's face. I do that sometimes. Just people are not going to be
[4970.28s -> 4978.30s]  happy about that if I do that on stream. I'm the guy that you go up against in chicken league
[4978.30s -> 4986.22s]  rank 25 that the first thing he does is do the two damage hunter spell that costs what one
[4986.22s -> 4993.42s]  mana to your face and you know immediately you're going to win. Yeah, arcane shot.
[4993.42s -> 4999.34s]  I'm the guy that does the arcane shot to you turn one to your face and you are guaranteed
[4999.34s -> 5007.77s]  to win that game. So that's why I can't stream. But thank you. I appreciate the enthusiasm on
[5007.77s -> 5018.17s]  the way. Thank you C4G. Hey trust no one. Thanks for the $2.50. December 2018 you announced
[5018.17s -> 5023.64s]  green screen encore. That was a long time ago. Right after that I got lots of inspiration to
[5023.64s -> 5032.44s]  produce 10 videos. It's summer already. Jerma lied again, but I still want to share my
[5032.44s -> 5038.58s]  works with you. Have you watched them before next stream? Want to bring fun to chat fellas?
[5038.66s -> 5046.55s]  Or no. It's always up to you daddy. All right you ready? You ready for this?
[5047.11s -> 5052.55s]  Are you ready? You have to hold me to this date. Are you ready? Are you ready for this?
[5052.55s -> 5055.75s]  Because I'm gonna make a date. I'm gonna give you a date here and like we have to do it.
[5061.26s -> 5093.37s]  It is June 4th 2019. We are going to do a watch the video stream on June 29th.
[5094.95s -> 5113.26s]  June 29th. I want to give people time to get them ready. June 29th of 2019. Can't be this week.
[5113.26s -> 5118.70s]  Can't be next week. I got like the E3 stuff is this weekend. I've got these like unlock
[5118.70s -> 5128.09s]  escape the room card things that I want to do on cam and then like the the week of the
[5129.29s -> 5135.38s]  like the 17th I've got something. You can clip it. Don't let me forget.
[5135.38s -> 5139.70s]  And I will give you some details about that. I want to give like a couple weeks so I can
[5140.42s -> 5147.72s]  get the some of the mods involved so we can actually set up something like last time.
[5152.09s -> 5155.93s]  This is not a re-watching of this would be new videos. Videos that were not
[5155.93s -> 5163.18s]  on the last stream and I may even if we I don't know maybe we just turn maybe we'll
[5163.18s -> 5170.18s]  just turn it into like uh I don't know let me think about this. Let me let me think
[5170.18s -> 5181.62s]  about this because I've got some ideas. Maybe they might not all have to be green screen
[5181.62s -> 5186.82s]  videos. You know what I'm saying? If we might maybe we could do something here
[5187.38s -> 5196.26s]  because people make lots of great videos that aren't necessarily only about green screen stuff.
[5196.98s -> 5203.18s]  I mean obviously they'd have to follow some criteria where it'd have to do with the channel.
[5203.74s -> 5209.78s]  Like you could don't just don't just like send me like a video of like Shrek playing
[5209.78s -> 5212.66s]  like the flute or something like what that means not what does that have to do with anything.
[5216.92s -> 5220.04s]  Well I'll figure that out. I'll start talking to some of the mods about it.
[5220.84s -> 5230.09s]  June 29th will be the day we do it. Arrest that guy. Now it has to happen. There you go.
[5232.12s -> 5236.02s]  And we could turn we could make it uh we can we might be able to make it interesting too.
[5236.58s -> 5240.02s]  Not that the last one wasn't interesting but maybe add a couple of things.
[5240.74s -> 5246.26s]  Maybe put some incentives. Maybe do like a charity thing. I don't know maybe. Let
[5246.26s -> 5264.22s]  let me just explore this. I'll explore this for a little bit. 29 guest stars. We'll see.
[5264.86s -> 5270.04s]  But I have not forgotten it's just kind of a lot of random shit has happened.
[5270.94s -> 5276.22s]  A bunch of people have visited here. I've had like friends and family and medical. Like
[5276.22s -> 5279.26s]  there's just been things that have been happening that I just can't really focus on
[5281.59s -> 5286.68s]  any of the projects that I want to focus on immediately. There's been a lot of just like
[5286.68s -> 5294.28s]  guests strangely enough. Some unexpected. But yeah it's that's just the way it is.
[5295.82s -> 5300.06s]  We're gonna push forward. But thank you trust no one. Look forward to seeing your videos.
[5302.66s -> 5307.62s]  Hey cornflex. Thanks for the 15 dollars cornflex. Hey German just quit my job and I
[5307.62s -> 5311.14s]  feel fly but I hope you're doing good. Here's a bit of snack money. Keep doing
[5311.14s -> 5315.54s]  you. I will buy snacks with those. I will buy 15 dollars worth of snacks I promise.
[5319.78s -> 5329.77s]  Uh quit your job. Hopefully you can figure out what to do next. Wish you the best of luck.
[5329.77s -> 5336.44s]  What do you mean I'm not gonna buy snacks with that. Guys like 45 percent of my whole income
[5336.44s -> 5345.19s]  goes to snacks. Like this is six pantries here. I can't stop. I eat like two bags of chips
[5345.19s -> 5355.82s]  every day. I can't stop. I eat a loaf of bread every fucking morning. I just soak the
[5355.82s -> 5367.93s]  bread in water and then like. I do not do that. But thank you for the 15 dollars cornflex.
[5369.21s -> 5376.15s]  I'm doing pretty good. Thank you for the snack money. After schmaff. After schmaff. Thanks for
[5376.15s -> 5380.15s]  the three bucks. I love everything you do. You're my favorite content creator by far.
[5380.15s -> 5383.67s]  Haven't caught a stream in a while because of emotional problems. So I'm glad to see
[5383.67s -> 5387.35s]  nothing's changed. Here's all the rest of my bits because you deserve it. I also wanted
[5387.43s -> 5396.28s]  ask you are you going to stream cyberpunk 2077? Okay well soon. Yes. I feel like you have to.
[5397.96s -> 5406.09s]  That game is just looks like it's so full of stuff to do. Whenever that comes out whatever
[5406.09s -> 5413.58s]  the criteria is for its release I feel like everyone. There's gonna be a day on twitch
[5414.54s -> 5420.22s]  where when you go to the browse by game category there's probably gonna be like
[5420.30s -> 5426.62s]  six games on that list and there'll be like fucking 40,000 people streaming 2077
[5427.50s -> 5438.31s]  and then like Hearthstone, League of Legends, and CSGO. Everyone's gonna play this game. So
[5438.31s -> 5464.95s]  I'll be one of them. 2077. Yeah 2077. 2077. Normie. Come on. Normie stream? What?
[5465.67s -> 5475.90s]  We just played like Heroes of Might and Magic 3. Why is cyberpunk 2077? What are you talking about?
[5479.06s -> 5482.74s]  Heroes of Might and Magic is so normie. What do you mean normie? What does that even mean?
[5483.54s -> 5501.06s]  What does that even mean? That's pretty normal. Heroes of Might and Magic is the most played
[5501.06s -> 5511.26s]  game of all time. Oh yeah? How many hours do you guys have in it? I bet I see a lot of
[5511.26s -> 5522.20s]  zeros. Two because it blue screens my computer. I'm sorry to hear that that's not cool.
[5523.16s -> 5533.21s]  Zero because I'm not a normie. I feel like if uh if you guys like watched me eat like frosted
[5533.21s -> 5542.87s]  flakes I'd be like a normie cereal. Right? What is not a normie cereal? What is not what is not
[5542.87s -> 5550.92s]  normie in like the cereal world? Brute Loops? No that's normie. Raisin Bran? That's normie.
[5552.30s -> 5560.22s]  Nothing. Everything is normie. Don't you understand? Honey Bunches of Oats? That's
[5560.22s -> 5568.82s]  not what are you talking about? That's very normal. Apple Jackson for Chad's?
[5572.87s -> 5585.67s]  Apple what? Honey Bunches of Oats? No. Bacon Flakes? Cookie Crisp? No that's bullshit.
[5585.67s -> 5590.38s]  Cookie Crisp before the recipe change. Maybe I would agree with you but they changed that
[5590.38s -> 5606.47s]  recipe. It doesn't taste the same. Fruity Pebbles? No I don't I disagree. Fruity Pebbles
[5606.47s -> 5614.06s]  you pour the milk in and before you put the spoon in to bite into the cereal it turns into wet
[5614.06s -> 5639.93s]  napkins. I disagree. Count Chocula. Now that I can get behind. I can get behind that. Anyways
[5639.93s -> 5655.30s]  what? I think Pops is a pretty... I think I could get behind that too. Or uh Smacks. When
[5655.30s -> 5665.32s]  was the last time you had Smacks? That's what it's called right? With the frog? Yeah Honey
[5665.32s -> 5674.60s]  Smacks. Honey Smacks. Those were awesome. I can get behind those. Those are the ones that looked
[5674.60s -> 5681.00s]  like coffee beans. They were little coffee beans puffed up. I might just go buy some.
[5682.74s -> 5686.26s]  I'm just gonna prove how much of a not of a normie I am. I'm gonna just eat Honey Smacks.
[5686.98s -> 5701.58s]  What are you linking me here? Kissed. I don't even know what that is. Cereal Unboxing. All
[5701.58s -> 5709.40s]  right let's keep going. Thank you Dr. Low Note for the five dollars. Pogchamp. Pogchamp. Pogchamp
[5709.40s -> 5716.60s]  Pogchamp had my LSAT yesterday. Glad you're back. I hope you're feeling good. Feeling pretty good.
[5717.24s -> 5730.46s]  Hopefully you did well on the LSAT. That's a Pogchamp yeah. Thank you for the five dollars
[5730.46s -> 5741.53s]  Dr. Low Note and hope you did good. Dorkcube7000 thanks for the 250. Now
[5742.41s -> 5746.33s]  when you went to get your colonoscopy you made sure to show the doc your fire watch photos
[5746.33s -> 5760.95s]  right? Doctor didn't need to see fire watch photos. He saw way more than that. Fire watch
[5760.95s -> 5769.61s]  photos don't even compare to the images. I have these images by the way. I was thinking about
[5771.13s -> 5778.84s]  they give them to you. It's a bunch of images but I don't think I can show them.
[5780.41s -> 5783.77s]  I'm fairly certain that that's like I don't know I think that might break TOS.
[5787.26s -> 5796.71s]  Autograph them. Post them on Twitter. I can't do that. Can't you get it? I can't do that.
[5798.58s -> 5805.06s]  Autograph? No it's like bad. There's like inflammation and stuff. You don't want to see
[5805.06s -> 5817.85s]  these but I already have new fire watch photos that the doctor took for me up my ass. That's
[5817.85s -> 5825.94s]  the fucking like comedy there. Put them on discord. No I'm not gonna like I'm not gonna
[5825.94s -> 5840.71s]  like fucking sign and show and sell my colonoscopy photos. That's like fucking
[5840.71s -> 5848.28s]  apocalyptic like dystopian world. Me selling photos of my colonoscopy. Me signing and
[5848.28s -> 5864.20s]  sending them to people. Welcome to 2020. What the fuck. But anyways yes thank you for
[5864.20s -> 5869.48s]  the 250 door cube. Thank you Devakitty for the four dollars and 25 cents. Happy pride month.
[5869.48s -> 5872.92s]  Take the rest of my bits in memory of the people like Marsha P who fought so hard for civil
[5872.92s -> 5880.62s]  liberty. Lesbian pride. Transgender pride. Happy pride month. Thank you so much for the four
[5880.62s -> 5890.81s]  dollars and 25 cents. Dr Oz did it and he's a doctor. Dr Oz also had a fucking tv show
[5890.81s -> 5901.85s]  where he was a doctor on tv. I'm not a fucking doctor on stream. I'm not Dr Oz. I don't go
[5901.85s -> 5908.78s]  on tv and talk about my stuff. Let me tell you something. I went to the store and I got
[5909.50s -> 5921.51s]  some lentils. I do a pretty good doctor, don't I? That's what he talks like. That's what he
[5921.51s -> 5935.46s]  talks like. Why are you comparing me to Dr Oz? That wasn't Bernie. That was that was Dr Oz.
[5936.10s -> 5941.69s]  Hello everybody and welcome to the Dr Oz show. I'm gonna fucking prove this right now.
[5943.93s -> 5948.97s]  Today I have a very important thing talked about on the show and that's colonoscopy.
[5949.05s -> 5966.87s]  At Dr Oz, I want to talk. Listen to me. You ready? I can't wait to prove everybody here wrong.
[5966.87s -> 5984.87s]  It feels so good. Hi Dr Oz here. Welcome to my official youtube channel. Hey Dr Oz here. Welcome

[6029.86s -> 6035.16s]  I'm gonna delete that Facebook. I'm gonna push the red button on that thing.
[6045.03s -> 6052.07s]  What's the next big thing that's gonna come along? Is it TikTok? I feel like that already
[6052.07s -> 6061.74s]  happened. Did TikTok take our children away from Facebook? Or is it Discord that took our
[6061.74s -> 6075.59s]  children away from Facebook? What's the second internet? I missed TikTok's birth and death.
[6076.31s -> 6083.74s]  I, yeah, I, I thought I, when I always thought of TikTok, I thought TikTok was
[6083.74s -> 6091.96s]  Vine. But then I was shown videos of what TikTok is. And it's people, people lip-syncing
[6092.52s -> 6103.43s]  for like eight seconds. And that's it. It's like Vine, but you lip-sync for like eight seconds.
[6110.57s -> 6123.46s]  It's just, it's a shittier Vine for Gen Z. It's Evil Vine. Evil, Evil Vine.
[6126.92s -> 6133.94s]  Why does that sound so funny? Vine was Gen Zoomer though. Well, why did they need another
[6133.94s -> 6141.72s]  one? Oh, it's because they deleted Vine. That's right. They deleted Vine and then Vine,
[6141.72s -> 6153.90s]  then TikTok took all the Vine kids, right? Oh, fuck. All I remember from TikTok is people
[6153.90s -> 6161.83s]  sending me videos of everybody having like vampire teeth. I swear, I think I have been shown
[6162.47s -> 6173.03s]  10 or 12 TikTok videos. And I think eight of them, they had vampire teeth. I'm just,
[6173.03s -> 6190.18s]  I'm just telling you just anecdotal things. Zoomers can't stay with something for more
[6190.18s -> 6201.75s]  than a couple of months. It's because they're fucking always moving. Vampires are normie.
[6201.75s -> 6208.31s]  Their brains are too small. What the fuck? Why? That's not, hey, wow.
[6210.68s -> 6214.76s]  We found the boomer. We found the boomer. I, you guys call me boomer.
[6215.56s -> 6221.93s]  Zoomers, yeah, sure. Their brains are all so small. All they do is drink fucking
[6222.01s -> 6227.93s]  Mountain Dew, game fuel, and floss and watch TikTok. That actually, is that what you do?
[6228.49s -> 6244.94s]  Is that what, that's what actually happens? Kind of. No, I'm talking about teeth. Like they
[6244.94s -> 6249.18s]  floss their teeth. Boomers don't floss their teeth. Neither do millennials. Zoomers are flossing
[6249.18s -> 6261.10s]  their teeth. That's one thing you got to remember. That's important. Mine is too beyond
[6261.10s -> 6269.62s]  that. That was funny. Anyways, thank you The Yellowist for the $5. Thank you, Yellowist.
[6270.26s -> 6275.22s]  Hey, Germo. There was a huge gap around 2016 where I couldn't find you in YouTube and didn't
[6275.22s -> 6280.18s]  know you made the jump to Twitch. So there was a ton of old content I missed, but I found them
[6280.18s -> 6284.90s]  recently. Just the streams in their entirety. So I'm going to get watching. PSU Sorcerer
[6284.90s -> 6291.30s]  streams were amazing. You got a lot, you got a lot of stuff to watch. Because unlike YouTube,
[6291.30s -> 6301.78s]  which was, you know, six to 12 minute videos, there are lots of five to 10 hour long streams.
[6302.50s -> 6307.70s]  You have hundreds of potential, hundreds of hours of stuff to go through. And you're going
[6307.70s -> 6312.58s]  to see some of the best fucking content you've seen in a decade. You thought Auto's Big Adventure
[6312.58s -> 6318.90s]  was good? Just wait till you see The Sims 4. You thought that GTA 4, One Day I'll Die
[6318.90s -> 6322.42s]  From Laughter, you think that was a good video? Just wait until you see the family dinner stream.
[6322.42s -> 6329.99s]  You thought, in your head, in your own mind, you thought that Breakfast with Doofus and Goofus
[6329.99s -> 6334.79s]  was a good video? Just wait until you get to the video content live demand of me playing
[6334.79s -> 6343.08s]  with the Nintendo Labo. I don't want to spoil anything for you, but you've got some good
[6343.08s -> 6358.34s]  things to catch up on. Maybe skip that one. No. No skip. But thank you, Yellowist. Welcome
[6358.34s -> 6366.34s]  back. Glad you could find me again. Don't watch the Skate 3 one, though. You'll come
[6366.34s -> 6375.06s]  across it and then like think I'm a bad person. Daft Skeletor. $30. No message,
[6375.06s -> 6378.58s]  but just a lot of money tonight and community subs. Thank you, Daft Skeletor
[6379.30s -> 6387.70s]  for your large, large amounts of money and your community subs. High, high contributions.
[6387.70s -> 6397.11s]  Thank you. It means a lot. And we had Atomic Fox for $15. Thank you, Atomic Fox for the
[6397.11s -> 6403.43s]  15 bucks. They say Pride. Jerma, happy Pride from a big gay. Been watching you a long time.
[6403.43s -> 6409.53s]  I don't have a lot of money, but I hope this is something. Gay Rides. Happy Pride Month.
[6410.17s -> 6416.41s]  Thank you so much for the $15. And you've been watching for a long time.
[6417.69s -> 6438.98s]  Thanks a lot. From a big gay. Thank you. $15. Big Gay Al. I forgot about Big Gay Al.
[6440.98s -> 6445.22s]  Jerma lied about the Clown Car. 5 community subs. Adventure MF Dan. 5 community subs.
[6449.19s -> 6456.10s]  Thank you. There were a lot of 5 drops tonight for community subs. You guys are awesome.
[6456.82s -> 6464.06s]  Thank you. Thank you Trampston for the $5. Local little man gets wallowed by his own
[6464.06s -> 6472.23s]  colon on stream in a fit of rage. Were you meant to say swallowed? Thank you for the $5.
[6473.19s -> 6483.29s]  Jerma lied about 5k subs. Thanks for the $2.60. Thanks a lot. Thanks for the $2.60.
[6485.05s -> 6493.72s]  I didn't lie. I just said I'm not doing it. That's not a lie. That's just me saying no.
[6493.72s -> 6498.44s]  I'm not going to do it. I mean is it a lie? No. Go back and watch it and get the whole
[6498.44s -> 6503.85s]  context there. Thank you Night Team for the $10 Night Team. I was excited to play Clone
[6503.85s -> 6509.13s]  Heroes today but the adapter that came today didn't work. So I have to wait 10 plus more days
[6509.13s -> 6522.79s]  for a new one. 10 days? In 2019? What's up with that? Glad you came back to stream.
[6523.35s -> 6528.47s]  Glad you came to stream to a now not so disappointing day. Hope you get better soon
[6528.47s -> 6538.22s]  Jerma Hart. Thank you. Thanks for the $10. And I'm doing pretty good. I'm still a little
[6538.94s -> 6549.40s]  crampy. I'll be fine. I'll be good. Thanks for the $10 Night Team. A wild Meryl thanks
[6549.40s -> 6556.04s]  for the $15. Just show love. Show love, show love, show love. Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[6556.68s -> 6567.18s]  No message. Thank you so much. A wild Meryl. Meryl. Thank you. Freudian Weapon thanks for
[6567.18s -> 6572.12s]  the $2.50 Freudian. Hey Jerma. Glad to hear everything went well. Good to have you back.
[6572.76s -> 6575.88s]  Try not to over exert yourself too much. It could be a real pain in the ass.
[6576.52s -> 6587.91s]  Sorry bad joke. Please don't ban me. Ban that guy. Thank you for the $2.50. Appreciate it.
[6587.91s -> 6595.03s]  Abomination Zero thanks for the $5. I was having a really really rough night but you
[6595.03s -> 6597.99s]  made it a lot better. Glad you could stream. Love you man. Thank you.
[6602.86s -> 6606.14s]  Sorry to hear you're not having a good night. Hopefully it gets better.
[6608.36s -> 6615.14s]  Thank you so much for the $5 and I really hope that you night really turns around. Thank you
[6615.14s -> 6628.41s]  Abomination Zero for the $5. Coconut Sales EO thanks for the $2.65. Hey Jerma. Worry not.
[6628.41s -> 6633.21s]  One more inch sir. I've bought one of your shirts. Thanks for the opportunity to buy one.
[6633.21s -> 6638.01s]  I just wanted to say after purchasing it I'm thoroughly impressed. Impressed sorry I meant
[6638.01s -> 6645.94s]  depressed. I used to be happy. Well you don't have the shirt yet so hopefully when
[6645.94s -> 6652.70s]  it gets there you'll be very happy about your purchase. Thank you for the $2.65. If
[6652.70s -> 6657.74s]  you bought a shirt I hope you love it because they are high quality. Very very competitively
[6657.74s -> 6667.21s]  priced but very good. You're gonna love it. But thank you. Hey Vilemi thanks for the $25.
[6667.93s -> 6674.28s]  $25 from Vilemi. Hey Jerma now that you're done with the colonoscopy you can finally
[6674.28s -> 6677.88s]  get back to chugging Mountain Dew like the gamer god that you are. Here's some bits so
[6677.88s -> 6687.27s]  you can stock up on that gamer brew I know you're craving. No I'm not gonna drink that
[6687.27s -> 6694.68s]  shit. Thank you for the $25 Vilemi. But I mean technically I probably could drink it but I'm
[6694.68s -> 6707.18s]  not going to. Hey FlyingPixels thanks for the $15.02. Much love to you and chat. Y'all are
[6707.18s -> 6717.56s]  awesome. I agree. Thanks for the $15 and yeah we got a pretty good chat here. We have some
[6717.56s -> 6729.78s]  pretty fun people here. Asana Genova thanks for the $3. I know it doesn't really fit with
[6729.78s -> 6733.94s]  the thematic of the channel but I made this hypothetical germ of room emote. Hope you like
[6733.94s -> 6751.69s]  it. It looks like a like a video game like go kart character. He's so cute. It's like the
[6752.33s -> 6760.02s]  Baron. I really appreciate it. Unfortunately there already is a germ of room emote that
[6760.02s -> 6766.63s]  is going to be coming very soon. Thank you so much for that though. It's very cute. It's
[6766.63s -> 6776.42s]  very nice. We actually have a lot of things coming. Bloor Dau is currently very hard at
[6776.42s -> 6782.82s]  work making a lot of new shit. There's going to be like five to ten new emotes. There's going
[6782.82s -> 6786.34s]  to be a bunch of new music. There's going to be a bunch of new stuff. Some new screens,
[6786.34s -> 6792.52s]  new animations. It's coming out. Bloor Dau is currently in the process of doing it now.
[6793.86s -> 6797.54s]  New music. Oh yeah there's going to be like 10 to 15 new tracks. I'm not making that up.
[6797.54s -> 6800.50s]  That's real. Jerma did not lie about Bloor Dau making 15 new music tracks.
[6801.30s -> 6812.17s]  I did just say 15 but it's like 10 maybe 12 maybe. It's going to be good stuff. But
[6812.17s -> 6821.46s]  thank you Sun of Genova. That's a very very cute emote. I love the scarf. Why don't we get a
[6821.46s -> 6836.94s]  Jerma popcorn? Like dog popcorn? Let's get the subs on the screen. Thank you everybody for
[6836.94s -> 6846.44s]  your subs. Here come the credits. We were actually, me and Bloor Dau were actually
[6846.44s -> 6853.38s]  talking about this. About how to change the credits a little bit maybe. Make them some
[6853.38s -> 6859.67s]  maybe more interesting. Change them up so it's not just a scrolling text. We might try to do
[6859.67s -> 6868.09s]  something with it. Should be fun. See if it's something we can do. But these are all subs
[6868.09s -> 6874.46s]  and wow there's a lot. There's a lot of reason. I guess I haven't been around for like four
[6874.46s -> 6885.99s]  days huh? Thanks everybody. Thank you. I know that you know some of you guys only have
[6885.99s -> 6890.23s]  like a few subscriptions. Some of you guys only have one sub that you do. Whether it's
[6890.23s -> 6897.29s]  like Prime or just a regular sub. And a lot of you guys have been subbed for a
[6898.25s -> 6906.57s]  just concurrently for a long long fucking time. So thank you for choosing me. If you do,
[6909.40s -> 6916.98s]  thank you. Because there are a lot of other people that stream on this platform so
[6917.96s -> 6928.02s]  I'm honored to have the people that sub to this channel sub. Thank you. We have a
[6928.02s -> 6938.18s]  couple more bits to do. We have five dollars from iCain, iCainling, iCain. I'm just gonna call you
[6938.18s -> 6947.19s]  iCain. My brain is having trouble. You can propose- I don't want to see spoilers. I don't
[6947.19s -> 6952.15s]  want to see season three spoilers for Sam and Max. I don't want to see spoilers for Sam and
[6952.15s -> 6963.43s]  Max season three. They say Max is extremely hot and if any of you disagree you're lying to
[6963.51s -> 6983.14s]  yourself. I'm just gonna fucking Homer Simpson into the bush. Because I don't- I can't- Thank
[6983.14s -> 6993.19s]  you for the five dollars. Dragon breath 75 thanks for the 250. Hey Jerma, I wanted to bring up
[6993.19s -> 6996.71s]  something about what it was like for me on the anesthetic. Reminder, I'm the guy that was
[6996.71s -> 7000.55s]  blabbering your name after my wisdom teeth removal. I do remember that video. It was very
[7000.55s -> 7005.67s]  funny. While I was out of it, I swear I had a dual personality experience. The voice in my
[7005.67s -> 7010.55s]  head sounded like me talking normal and I was yelling at myself to say normal things but
[7010.55s -> 7013.43s]  nothing came out right. Did you have any experience like that with your colonoscopy?
[7014.55s -> 7019.19s]  No I was completely- I was completely aware of all the things that I was saying and doing.
[7020.31s -> 7027.93s]  I have had that experience before on a different anesthesia where before getting
[7027.93s -> 7033.45s]  the IV, I remember saying to myself, oh I really hope I don't say anything stupid or
[7033.45s -> 7036.49s]  funny. Don't say anything dumb. Don't say anything funny. Don't say anything stupid.
[7037.45s -> 7043.37s]  And as I was getting the medicine and I started to kind of go out, I said to the person that was
[7044.01s -> 7049.05s]  administering it, hey do people say anything funny on this? And they told me to stop talking.
[7049.05s -> 7062.95s]  They were like stop talking, stop. Your brain's weird. It does just strange things. Yeah I was
[7062.95s -> 7068.01s]  told to stop. I was actually told to shut up by the person that was doing it because I was
[7068.01s -> 7073.29s]  just so- I was floating out of existence and the one thing that I thought to say was,
[7073.37s -> 7078.49s]  hey do people ever say anything funny on this? Because I was over and over again telling my brain
[7078.49s -> 7084.09s]  not to say anything funny. So I was trying to pretend to be completely with it for some reason.
[7084.73s -> 7087.69s]  Like hey do people ever say anything funny on this? Because I'm not going to say anything
[7087.69s -> 7095.99s]  funny because I just told myself not to say anything funny. It probably came out really
[7095.99s -> 7100.87s]  fucked up. Yeah it was probably really embarrassing and so was me telling the nurse
[7100.87s -> 7103.91s]  that this is not my first rodeo when I'm trying to put my shoes on and almost put
[7103.91s -> 7111.86s]  my head through the drywall. Brain altering, brain chemistry altering drugs, hard drugs like that,
[7111.86s -> 7119.93s]  just fucking turn you upside down. You didn't hear that part? I told the story at the beginning
[7119.93s -> 7127.06s]  of the stream. But I remember everything. I remember waking up. The last thing I remember,
[7127.06s -> 7131.46s]  I remember on my side, because you have to lie on your side when they do the colonoscopy,
[7132.18s -> 7137.14s]  and the guy said, hey you're gonna feel like a sting in your arm. It's pretty,
[7137.14s -> 7140.90s]  it's normal. That's what happens right before and I felt a little sting and then I woke up.
[7142.89s -> 7152.04s]  So but when I woke up I was completely aware. It's not like oh I have no idea about anything
[7152.04s -> 7156.92s]  I said. I was completely aware of where I was and what I was saying, but I was still saying
[7156.92s -> 7165.58s]  fucking dumb shit. And the nurse came in and was talking to me and I kept on talking about
[7165.58s -> 7171.02s]  how great of a practice it was. And you guys are all pros. You guys are all pros. You guys
[7171.02s -> 7178.15s]  are pros. Let me tell you. I may have, I don't, I have this weird half memory of saying this.
[7178.15s -> 7181.91s]  I might not have, but maybe I did. That I was going to give like a Yelp review.
[7184.65s -> 7196.30s]  Can you even give a Yelp review for a hospital? Is that even possible? I guess,
[7196.30s -> 7205.96s]  yeah, I guess it is. The cafeteria. I give review for like getting like surgery and it's
[7205.96s -> 7213.42s]  like the cafeteria in the hospital. Everyone there was a pro. The colonoscopy was fantastic.
[7214.06s -> 7217.66s]  The doctors were so nice. The nurse when they were doing the IV and it's like,
[7218.38s -> 7223.10s]  uh dude, how was like the, how was the fucking toast? What are you talking about?
[7226.20s -> 7228.92s]  But yeah, I almost fell down like three times putting my shoes on.
[7229.40s -> 7235.08s]  I was trying so hard to be normal. That's the worst part because you know you're so fucked up.
[7235.08s -> 7240.22s]  You know you're on hard drugs and you are so desperate to be normal. You're doing,
[7240.22s -> 7245.88s]  you're trying so hard that you try too hard and you do something stupid. And then in
[7245.88s -> 7250.28s]  your brain you go, a normal person wouldn't do what I just did. I have to correct this.
[7251.16s -> 7255.40s]  Hey, don't worry. This ain't my first rodeo. I have to correct that. And I,
[7255.40s -> 7267.02s]  normal people don't say that either. You completely go over what a normal person does.
[7271.13s -> 7277.40s]  But the thing is I was, that was not incorrect. This ain't my first rodeo. I've had two
[7278.36s -> 7283.46s]  sigmoidoscopies. So maybe my brain was saying like, no, no, it's fine. I've had this done
[7283.46s -> 7289.42s]  like before. Or the nurse probably thought I was talking about how I do drugs all the time.
[7293.38s -> 7298.46s]  Right? Like we talked about in the beginning of the stream. Sir, sir, sir, please sit down.
[7298.46s -> 7308.28s]  Please. No, no, this ain't my first rodeo. I do drugs every day. Oh, oh, okay. They have
[7308.84s -> 7322.62s]  both of those scenarios work. Yeah. But yes, Dragon Breath, that is, drugs are fucking
[7322.62s -> 7331.05s]  ridiculous. I don't do them. I don't like doing them. Rock Esper, thanks for the 250.
[7331.05s -> 7335.53s]  Random question, but I've just been curious. Many streams back, you mentioned listening to
[7335.53s -> 7340.25s]  the Lost Odyssey OST in your car. Do you like that game? Because it's one of my all-time
[7340.25s -> 7349.40s]  favorites. Also, you're cute. Yes. I told you, yeah, I did tell that story about how
[7350.28s -> 7355.56s]  I had some like people that I worked with. There were some acquaintances that were in
[7355.56s -> 7359.56s]  my car and I was driving people home and stuff. And I was playing that. And they
[7359.56s -> 7368.02s]  thought I was fucking crazy. Lost Odyssey OST. Remember, this is more than, this is like 15
[7368.02s -> 7378.81s]  years ago. Can you think of anyone in your entire life that would have the Lost Odyssey
[7378.81s -> 7391.58s]  OST in their car in the CD player? Besides me and besides you. That's why it was so
[7391.58s -> 7396.62s]  embarrassing because it's just like, I don't know, maybe like part of it was trying to
[7396.62s -> 7401.43s]  seem like interesting or something. Hey, what music is, what are you gonna put on? Oh,
[7401.43s -> 7406.14s]  put this on, I guess. Look at how interesting I am. Oh, you're listening to like
[7406.86s -> 7413.99s]  classical music. No, it's video game music. Oh, look at how interesting you are. Yeah,
[7413.99s -> 7424.10s]  I am. Maybe part of me like thought that was what I was doing. I listened to OST. Yeah,
[7424.10s -> 7430.20s]  well, not 2019. This is a different time. Back in like, back in like 2003,
[7432.01s -> 7435.37s]  there wasn't like Overwatch costumes at the spirit of Halloween stores.
[7435.93s -> 7441.91s]  You know what I'm saying? This is like before, this is before games were like cool.
[7442.55s -> 7454.01s]  This is back in the day where video games were still kind of like video games.
[7455.75s -> 7465.85s]  Well, what's a PC gaming? I've heard of that. So like listening to like a video game OST in
[7465.85s -> 7470.97s]  your car now is like, oh, whatever. But in 15 years ago, it was kind of like, why are
[7470.97s -> 7489.88s]  you doing this? Back in my day, we had put you know, 15, not 50, 15. But did you Oh,
[7489.88s -> 7495.24s]  yeah, let me answer the question. Did you like the game? Oh, yeah, I did. I liked the
[7495.24s -> 7501.54s]  combat system in that game. I thought it was engaging. It wasn't just put cursor on this
[7501.54s -> 7510.49s]  person and let them get hit. I liked the timed hits. I'm a huge fan of Super Mario RPG and in a
[7510.49s -> 7515.37s]  traditional turn based RPG that gives you some kind of control. I like better than just putting
[7515.37s -> 7521.82s]  a cursor on somebody. timed hits are more fun for me because it engages me in the game.
[7524.81s -> 7528.68s]  Yeah, I thought it was good. I was sad to see that they weren't going to do anything more
[7528.68s -> 7536.09s]  with that franchise or that series. Because it wasn't um, what's the designer's name,
[7536.09s -> 7540.81s]  he was commissioned to do two or three games for the Xbox. And then that was it.
[7540.81s -> 7544.09s]  And there was talk that he might do another one, but never came out never happened.
[7544.89s -> 7555.10s]  The same guy that did Blue Dragon, right? Blue was Blue Dragon, right? Am I thinking
[7555.10s -> 7565.83s]  of the right thing? Am I excited for cooking simulator tomorrow? Oh, hell yeah. So yeah,
[7565.83s -> 7570.95s]  I did want to see another installment in the series. I thought if they had a second go at
[7570.95s -> 7573.43s]  it, they could have improved on some of the things that I didn't like it made a better
[7573.43s -> 7577.83s]  game. And, you know, I think it was like a solid game to begin with. But yeah,
[7580.41s -> 7587.51s]  but thank you for the 250 Rock Esper creamy sensation. Thanks for the $5. Appreciate it.
[7588.66s -> 7594.02s]  No message. Thank you. Sergio, but thanks for the 250. I've been under a few times
[7594.02s -> 7600.97s]  and each time has been such a trip. I had a liver biopsy at like 17. And I was still
[7600.97s -> 7608.22s]  young enough to be in the pediatric hospital. So I came to just slurring. Oh,
[7608.22s -> 7614.94s]  fuck, that feels so weird. I can't even feel my eyes yet. God damn it. Next to a five-year-old
[7614.94s -> 7630.20s]  playing on his iPad. Oh, that's a good, that's a good story. That was a good story.
[7631.40s -> 7648.14s]  Oh, fuck, this feels so weird. Thank you for the 250 Sergio, but and then Space Dad rules.
[7648.14s -> 7653.75s]  Thanks for the $15 right at the very end. They say, I love you. Thank you. Space Dad rules
[7655.02s -> 7664.22s]  15 bucks. Not even a minute ago. Thank you so much. And that's going to be it for tonight.
[7666.20s -> 7674.42s]  I will see you guys. I will see you guys tomorrow. Tomorrow is going to be a new game
[7674.42s -> 7680.50s]  called on this show. That's not the name of the game. The game is going to be called
[7680.50s -> 7684.90s]  Cooking Simulator. I'm going to show you some healthy recipes that you can have in your home
[7686.10s -> 7701.77s]  with low spices. I promise on the next Actas. Maybe the whole stream is Dr. Roz. Okay. If I
[7701.77s -> 7708.04s]  didn't, if I didn't say anything, if I just, if I talked like that, just from the beginning
[7708.04s -> 7713.85s]  of the stream, people would be fucking so irritated by that. I think if I didn't like
[7713.85s -> 7719.83s]  make it a joke, if I was just doing that, I would give that like 15 to 20 minutes before people
[7719.83s -> 7726.66s]  were like, stop doing this. Stop fucking doing that. Why are you doing that? And I just didn't,
[7726.66s -> 7731.75s]  it would, I would get too self-conscious and have to stop it unless it was like a very
[7731.75s -> 7738.87s]  specific bit or routine that I was planning or doing. I couldn't talk like Dr. Oz during the
[7738.87s -> 7746.82s]  whole stream. You say you think that would be funny, but after five minutes, let's see.
[7754.58s -> 7760.74s]  Dr. Oz for Jerma Rumble. Okay. Yeah. Yup. Oh, you better fucking believe it. I swear to God.
[7762.12s -> 7770.71s]  I swear to God. Yes. I'm seeing a lot of nos. Yes. I don't care. Dr. Oz is going to be like
[7770.71s -> 7779.61s]  in the next ladder match. You heard it here first. It's going to happen. This is a one-off
[7779.61s -> 7785.77s]  joke. Yes. I know. So the 13, 1400 people here, you're the only people that are going to
[7785.77s -> 7789.91s]  think this is funny. No one else is going to know what this is. And that's, I don't care.
[7789.91s -> 7799.26s]  That's fine. And scan his face and like put it in. People are going to be like, why is Dr. Oz
[7799.26s -> 7804.94s]  here? Do you watch Dr. Oz? The only way that would be possible is if I watched Dr. Oz every
[7804.94s -> 7813.51s]  day. And I like was a fan. I'll just pretend to be a fan. Yeah. That sounds about right.
[7819.50s -> 7823.58s]  Now. Yeah. Now I got to watch Dr. Oz to get some info so I can make some
[7824.54s -> 7832.49s]  interesting references. I'm going to do some Dr. Oz research. Yeah. I got to find out
[7832.49s -> 7841.83s]  what kind of shirts he wears, the pants he wears. All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a good
[7841.83s -> 7848.42s]  rest of your night. But hold on. Moo means Moo just came with five dollars. Moo means Moo hospital
[7848.42s -> 7853.30s]  Yelp review. They got my order wrong. I went in for blood work and they took out a kidney
[7853.30s -> 7862.55s]  instead. Terrible service. One star. Thank you Moo. All right. See you guys tomorrow.
[7862.55s -> 7867.35s]  Cooking simulator. Should be fun. Take care. Have a great rest of your night.
