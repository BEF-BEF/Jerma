[1.34s -> 64.18s]  Hello. Tweet that there's a stream at 12 30. Hold on, I might be in the room. All right, I got it.
[64.18s -> 69.80s]  How are you? Jeremy, you never say hi when the person says hi, Jeremy Wormy.
[72.18s -> 84.20s]  Shit. Hey! But I, how do I respond to that? Yeah, I'm, should I say no? I was gonna say should I say
[86.07s -> 98.65s]  chatty waddy? That kind of hurts to say that. That's, no, that's like a, that's like a you're
[98.65s -> 106.60s]  dating somebody. That's, I don't know if I want that. Oh, hey, Jeremy Wormy. Oh, hey, chatty
[106.60s -> 115.53s]  waddy. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm gonna just continue to say hi. That's like creepy.
[115.53s -> 122.81s]  That's a creepy thing. I'm not sure I'm okay with that. Anyways, let me just tweet this. Yeah,
[122.81s -> 143.40s]  early stream. Uh, there's a couple of reasons for it, but hold on. Early Mega Man. Early Mega Man.
[144.04s -> 150.31s]  He has to leave in two hours. No, that is not accurate. Please do not spread misinformation
[150.31s -> 162.20s]  about me needing to leave in two hours. I have to leave in three. Okay, come on, get it right.
[164.31s -> 170.52s]  Uh, I have another doctor's appointment today and this, that's all, this is all just fucked up.
[170.52s -> 174.44s]  You know what I mean? Like just this whole, you know, I don't, you know how it is. You know,
[174.44s -> 177.64s]  we've talked about it a bunch of times. It's just fucked up and I'm fucking annoyed by it,
[177.64s -> 189.18s]  but let's just, hey, I'm good. We should make a clip of like, what, what, what, what,
[189.18s -> 194.54s]  what's Jerma talking about? It's just fucked up and I'm fucking annoyed by it. Yeah, that's it.
[194.54s -> 202.47s]  That's all we need. But yeah, I got a doctor's appointment today. So I got to get back into the
[202.47s -> 213.21s]  doctor and I could be like, Hey doc, play Mega No. Am I wearing my boomer brace? No, I'm actually
[213.21s -> 217.85s]  not wearing it today because I ordered a new one and the new one is supposed to be a little bit
[217.85s -> 225.45s]  better because the one I have now really kind of tears into my armpits and I've tried to adjust
[225.45s -> 231.05s]  it, its length and everything. It was pretty cheap. So I got, I got a new boomer base boomer
[231.05s -> 240.17s]  brace 2.0. Oh, that should be here soon. Plus I only plan on sitting here for about three hours
[240.17s -> 250.79s]  or so. So I think I'll be fine. And my physical therapist did say that I really shouldn't rely
[251.59s -> 256.82s]  on a brace because it can become, he said it can become kind of a crutch.
[258.39s -> 264.36s]  So I really don't want to do that. You know, he's like, you'll start wearing it every single day
[264.36s -> 268.94s]  and then you're like, you can't do anything with that unless it's on. And I got to be careful with
[268.94s -> 273.96s]  that too, but it's only for sitting for long periods. Wait a wink. Did I, did my, did I even
[273.96s -> 283.58s]  tweet anything? Did I just press the tweet button? Where is it? I don't see it. Did I like accidentally
[283.58s -> 287.42s]  tweet under, like, did I like click on somebody that I'm following and tweet underneath them?
[288.06s -> 297.69s]  I didn't know. Why is it not on my feet? All right. All right, let's go. You remember this game?
[297.69s -> 306.10s]  You remember Mega Man? Let's actually turn it on. It was a real wink. I know. And guess what? I've
[306.10s -> 315.69s]  got clothes on. Oh, I've, I've got, I've got clothes on. I have to wear fucking clothes every day.
[316.57s -> 328.14s]  This is so rare for me to wear clothes every day. It's rare. All right. So the last thing we did,
[329.10s -> 344.39s]  uh, it looks all right. Is it fucked up? Hold on. Uh, no, it looks fine. Okay. Doctor waiting room.
[344.39s -> 350.62s]  I mean, you could say this is just a giant doctor waiting room. That's right. All right. So I just
[350.62s -> 356.26s]  got like one of the crystals, right? What was I doing? I remember I was tired and I was like
[356.26s -> 359.46s]  freaking out and I couldn't decide. I couldn't figure out where a door was. I have to go back
[359.46s -> 378.36s]  down there. Don't I? There's going to be an era that people like, like, let's say three or four
[378.36s -> 383.00s]  years from now. If somebody just finds this channel, they're like, oh, this guy, German985,
[383.00s -> 389.98s]  maybe I'll check up on his VODs. Is it going to be a Reddit thread complaining about this era?
[389.98s -> 394.54s]  Like, Hey, man, I just like was curious. I'm like going back and watching old VODs and like, why
[394.54s -> 399.10s]  did he like every like four and a half minutes winking to the camera? Like it was kind of annoying
[399.10s -> 402.18s]  and I'm going to have to sit there and be like, fuck, well there were these things called channel
[402.18s -> 405.94s]  points. They don't exist anymore. They got deleted. Twitch doesn't even use them anymore.
[408.57s -> 411.45s]  I'm already saved. What am I? All right. What do I do now? Let's talk to the, let's talk to the
[411.45s -> 416.65s]  monkey. Tell me what should I do now? Oh, the flutter might not be fully operational yet,
[416.65s -> 424.86s]  but at least we can get to the sub gate in the closer woods. Did I not finish up what I was
[424.86s -> 431.98s]  doing in there? I was here before the link error. Did I, did I not, was this something I didn't do
[431.98s -> 444.66s]  here? I remember I fought the three, uh, dog wolf monsters, right? Come on, let me see.
[444.66s -> 450.02s]  Do the auto voice where I'm leaving. This way, that way, this way, that way, this way, that way.
[450.02s -> 454.28s]  That's my favorite like comment of the whole year. All right. So was it something I didn't do down
[454.28s -> 471.19s]  here? Cause I killed the boss. Wasn't the boss, the, um, oh, the ID cards, the ID cards. Okay.
[471.19s -> 482.14s]  Yeah. So I do have to be here. Remember it's past your bedtime. Go to bed. I woke up like two hours
[482.14s -> 494.26s]  ago. I, what are you, what are you talking about? I'm not, I'm not going to bed. All right. These
[494.26s -> 499.19s]  guys. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I time to pay attention. And remember
[499.19s -> 509.75s]  where the control room was? Cause I don't, it's, you know, it's something about this level in
[509.75s -> 518.17s]  particular. Like I cannot burn into memory this level. It's, uh, this level doesn't exist. I can,
[518.17s -> 522.17s]  okay. You know, like the, the, the first place we were like that factory level, I could, I could
[522.17s -> 526.71s]  go do that right now. It's not, I don't know what it is about this level in particular. I cannot put
[526.71s -> 543.56s]  this into long-term memory. It's like a block. All right. Drop some help please. I think it's
[543.56s -> 551.30s]  right in here. I have a shit load of money too. Did I remember about the holes? Don't forget about
[551.30s -> 565.77s]  the holes. Was it this way? This is right in the middle. I think is this correct? Is this right?
[565.77s -> 576.81s]  All right. It's in the first room. No. Yeah. Cause then you go up the elevator, right?
[578.23s -> 587.29s]  Oh, let me just kill this guy. Like if it's sub ended feels bad, man. It's all right. It's all
[587.29s -> 599.32s]  right. Wait, are we getting, are we getting, are we getting coxed? What? It's been a while since
[599.32s -> 605.14s]  that has happened. All right. Let's go back. You know, I think it's cause it's a big circle
[605.22s -> 610.20s]  and both the, yeah, both sides are identical. Minor cox. Oh, okay.
[615.78s -> 620.02s]  Well, did you get one near shoe? Just gave 10 community subs. Were you,
[620.02s -> 635.75s]  did you get another one back? Did you get one? I got it. Oh, sick. All right. And then we go up.
[637.35s -> 649.42s]  Wait, hold on. It's not over here. Is it? Okay. Now it's right over here. It's, it's like here,
[649.42s -> 659.82s]  right here somewhere. Isn't it? Well, this area hurts my brain so much. I was going to stand it.
[659.82s -> 662.70s]  I'm literally going to stand in the first room and you just tell me what room to go into.
[663.66s -> 695.82s]  I have no idea which way I have absolutely no idea where I'm going up that way, that way.
[696.78s -> 707.91s]  Oh, wait, what? I'm, I'm so confused. Why is this a memory block? Like it's this whole level is a
[707.91s -> 724.57s]  block. I can't even see in this level. It's like a full block. Wait, and here it's only this level.
[724.57s -> 734.52s]  It's only this one. Look, I'm like in this set. I'm like, I'm in the same room again in the,
[734.52s -> 752.38s]  right in the middle. It's, it's only this level. Well, I've played seven hours of this game and
[752.38s -> 759.59s]  this is the only time I've had a problem here. I don't know what it is about this place. Is it in
[759.59s -> 769.78s]  the center? It's cause there's like two circle rooms and no, it's definitely not the center.
[775.96s -> 780.07s]  I'm going to just draw a map on a fucking piece of paper. No, this is wrong.
[787.27s -> 797.34s]  It is this way. I can't do this place. Boomer struggles with a kid's game. No, it's just this
[797.34s -> 807.27s]  one area. It's the double circle rooms with like the three side rooms. I'm going this way.
[807.27s -> 830.10s]  I'm just going to keep, I'm just going to walk this way. See what happens. This is the generator
[830.10s -> 843.18s]  room. Go back up to the entrance. Why is it only this level that causes me so many problems?
[845.67s -> 856.84s]  Go back to the elev, go the first room. Okay. So I have to go over here and
[858.04s -> 867.13s]  it wasn't, I just in the first room. So many places look identical in this place. It's hard
[867.13s -> 896.44s]  to even remember. Okay. I should just die and walk in the fucking front door. They'll go in this hole.
[897.24s -> 906.17s]  Just kill me. I'd rather just die and restart the game and walk in and then, then try to figure out
[906.17s -> 926.47s]  the map in this game. What did I, what did I just in here? Hey, I found the computer.
[955.82s -> 967.24s]  Pick a man. I have trouble with it too. Don't worry. Game is quiet. I did. I don't know why
[967.24s -> 996.17s]  it's that quiet. I don't have that much like stream resources today. I just spent like
[996.17s -> 999.45s]  nine minutes walking around in circles, trying to find a computer room.
[1000.25s -> 1004.01s]  That's precious real estate today. Cause I can only be live for like three and a half hours.
[1011.37s -> 1031.35s]  Oh God, I have no health. Do I have a canteen? No. Fuck. Nope. Don't die. Don't die on the way out.
[1031.35s -> 1036.79s]  Please don't make me have to go through that again. I, I know, I know. Exit the map. I know.
[1037.43s -> 1055.03s]  But there's people here. Oh, no, there's not. Wait, you have to go up and then out, right?
[1055.83s -> 1060.30s]  I need, I want to be certain of this and I'm never going back here ever again, even if the
[1060.30s -> 1070.04s]  best weapon of the whole game is here. Up and leave. Yes. Up and out. Okay. You could tell me that
[1071.00s -> 1076.28s]  $500 would get deposited into my bank account. If I went back here and I'd be like, no, I don't want
[1076.28s -> 1102.70s]  to feel like somebody else will do it. And then I'll go, I'll get like my electric bill in the mail
[1102.70s -> 1112.01s]  and be like, how much is this for? $487. Hey guys, what's up? It's me, Jerma. I just want to say that
[1112.01s -> 1119.21s]  I had a change of heart and I would like to go back into that fun room. I was just kidding that
[1119.21s -> 1129.32s]  whole time. All right, let's see. I got a really bad feeling about this. Like we're getting into
[1129.32s -> 1154.65s]  something better left alone. Sonic. The tuber voice is Sonic the Hedgehog. I'm sure you could
[1154.65s -> 1162.28s]  probably take clips of all the time Sonic has talked and put it in the background over somebody's
[1162.28s -> 1181.93s]  Five Nights at Freddy's gameplay. And it would make sense. It would match. All right. Got the
[1181.93s -> 1199.40s]  game saved. So, uh, the thing opened. Let's talk to Grant. See, Grant. I'm slowing down in my old
[1199.40s -> 1205.32s]  age, Mega Man. Won't be able to help you like I used to. I guess I'll just stay here and watch TV.
[1205.32s -> 1214.97s]  Why don't you stay and watch TV with me? See, look there. It's Catalox Island. That's kind of sad.
[1214.97s -> 1226.06s]  I just want to sit here and watch TV. All right. So let's, um, correct me if I'm wrong, but that
[1226.06s -> 1234.70s]  thing that opened was the thing that was where I fought that boss. The tank boss, right? So I want
[1234.70s -> 1246.58s]  to go back there. No, that's incorrect. What just opened? You haven't even seen the thing that opened
[1246.58s -> 1266.41s]  yet. Oh, playing this fucking thing. He went back. No, no, no, no. I know. I don't have to be here.
[1267.58s -> 1274.06s]  I have to tell. No, my God. I thought I would. Why would I come out that way? What?
[1292.49s -> 1296.73s]  Game's not loading now because I can't believe that I just didn't. I just like fucked that up
[1296.73s -> 1305.06s]  somehow. It's like, wait, we didn't load the game because we like can't believe you turned around
[1305.06s -> 1346.09s]  and went back in the door and broke the fucking game. Is the CD broken? Like what's going? Did I
[1346.09s -> 1361.61s]  break the fucking CD because I turned around? I didn't do anything. Did I like, did I like record
[1361.61s -> 1386.09s]  scratch like, oh shit, we were loading the other area and you, oh fuck. Thank God I saved it right
[1386.09s -> 1409.80s]  there. It's dead. I don't know what's fucking wrong with me. I need some fucking Wheaties.
[1409.80s -> 1417.59s]  All right. Please take this back to the fucking forest. For the love of God, get me out of here.
[1417.59s -> 1457.86s]  I never want to see this part of the game again. You already saw it three times. You'll be back.
[1458.42s -> 1483.59s]  I hope not. Look at that side eye. Now that he's opened the main gate for us,
[1483.59s -> 1489.43s]  we don't need to keep him around any longer. Time to blow him and that ship of his to kingdom
[1489.51s -> 1493.27s]  come. All board cannons, prepare to fire.
[1494.87s -> 1498.82s]  Fire.
[1519.77s -> 1521.45s]  Cease fire.
[1526.15s -> 1536.06s]  They're trying to lose us in the clouds. After them. Why am I wrong? What even 50 degrees are
[1536.06s -> 1542.41s]  right now? A fly just like, that's the first fly I think I've seen in Vegas. It's trying to kill me.
[1549.29s -> 1553.05s]  Isn't that like a sign of something? What does a fly mean? What does a fly trying to kill you
[1553.05s -> 1579.94s]  mean in lore? Doesn't it mean something bad? It means you just stink.
[1589.59s -> 1594.79s]  Bees above the devil manifest as a fly in the real world. So if I killed this fly,
[1594.79s -> 1606.36s]  I'd kill the devil. That'd be weird. Well I got homing missiles though, so we should be good.
[1607.88s -> 1616.97s]  I mean it kind of is a problem. Final battle? What do you mean final battle with the with the
[1617.61s -> 1624.76s]  galestia shaft, galus shaft. Destroy the warcraft galus shaft while protecting the flutter from
[1624.76s -> 1634.33s]  attack. Mission start. Final battle? No it's not. Look at how small this area. All right let's just
[1634.33s -> 1639.77s]  do homing. Let's not save them. All right they're doing like synchronized swimming.
[1645.05s -> 1662.76s]  I'm just gonna stay in the squad and aim. Fire. God. It's getting closer. How close is it gonna get?
[1662.76s -> 1680.55s]  Did I just do it? That was a final battle? I can't believe I fucking almost broke this.
[1682.55s -> 1689.43s]  Oh god damn it. That's so bad. I'm so embarrassed. I can't get over it. I'm so sad.
[1690.07s -> 1698.57s]  They bought us enough time to catch up with blue boy there. There they go. They're gone.
[1701.34s -> 1708.04s]  Diesel they're underneath us. They're right below the ghastly shaft. Underneath? They couldn't have.
[1708.68s -> 1716.52s]  They must have discovered our weak spot. Battle stations. It looks like they're serious. They
[1716.52s -> 1722.76s]  want to go out fighting just like cornered rats. On your toes everyone. Radu.
[1722.76s -> 1732.47s]  It's not possible. They're flying the ship. It's our turn to talk. It's our scene.
[1734.26s -> 1743.80s]  Remember your lines Mega Man. It's our. The cameras are rolling. All right right the belly.
[1763.61s -> 1766.49s]  Engine. Aim for the underside of the engine on the wing. Shoot in the eye.
[1767.29s -> 1781.99s]  Are you sure you don't want me to shoot it in the eye? I got rid of that. That's it. Keep it up.
[1782.97s -> 1792.47s]  Don't give them any breathing room. Right there. That's what you want.
[1803.82s -> 1821.00s]  Come on get it. Get it. Whoa no no too much turn. Too much tilt.
[1823.11s -> 1832.46s]  Dude that was an epic fucking reference. That's what I'd like to do here on German 95 is make
[1832.46s -> 1838.30s]  references and talk about stuff and give wacky analytics to stuff too. That's what we do if
[1838.30s -> 1843.74s]  you're new to the channel. Hey how are you? Why is everybody that. Okay I got a question.
[1846.79s -> 1856.36s]  Why is everybody that has like a weird way of saying like hey or hello. Hey everybody. What's
[1856.36s -> 1869.13s]  up? Hey. They all do. They all say hey in like a weird way. I did it. I did it. Hey what's going
[1869.13s -> 1873.93s]  on everybody? Jerma here with a T-42 gameplay. Like why did I do that? What was the point of that?
[1873.93s -> 1883.32s]  Why do we all do that? Like 2012. It's like every every youtuber's first sentence they forget how to
[1883.32s -> 1890.89s]  talk. And then they're like oh wait hold on a second. I'm a human. I'm like a normal person.
[1890.89s -> 1896.39s]  I gotta talk normally. All right this one's dead. This one's dead. What are you doing?
[1896.39s -> 1926.54s]  Other side's not hurt. Game is loud. I'm sorry.
[1932.36s -> 1955.74s]  Yeah that's what I'm saying. Okay goodbye. Final battle. Yeah no the game was just way too loud.
[1955.74s -> 1962.52s]  I had it was like almost peaking. See you in fucking hell.
[1968.12s -> 1981.46s]  Imagine they took a really dark turn and Mega Man just goes like see you in hell. Wild. Right
[1981.46s -> 1987.29s]  before the ship explodes he goes that implies you're going to hell too. Boom. And then Mega Man goes
[1987.37s -> 1989.85s]  what? Oh right fuck.
[2006.39s -> 2013.43s]  Tuber joke. Yeah we do those sometimes. Well I already know the spoiler.
[2016.63s -> 2021.98s]  I mean this whole video game with the misadventures of Tron Bone.
[2024.01s -> 2029.53s]  Like I know this plug. How do you hold on? Wait wait wait. I'm like all right I'm in the middle
[2029.53s -> 2034.17s]  of taking. I'm in the middle of taking like a fucking multivitamin. Like you know I'm not
[2034.17s -> 2039.21s]  kidding. Like what am I doing? You know now's a good time to take a fucking multivitamin
[2039.21s -> 2059.40s]  right now. Can you drink coconut water? I need fucking potassium man. I'm low on potassium today.
[2060.12s -> 2070.60s]  I don't drink every day. All right where are you? Where are you?
[2071.32s -> 2080.18s]  Oh my god. This is not fair. Where? Oh my. There you are. How do I hit you?
[2081.22s -> 2102.18s]  Wait is this script? Is this a scripted scene? It sounds like I can hit. Lock on? I'm trying.
[2102.18s -> 2126.25s]  Lock on is not doing it. R2. Not locking on. R2. Nothing. R2. Nothing. It's scripted. Scripted.
[2128.30s -> 2145.90s]  Okay apparently not. Holy shit. Okay that went from the easiest fight to the hardest
[2145.90s -> 2155.99s]  fight. But I can't. Do I have to like get off them? So all right I'm not going to use my
[2155.99s -> 2169.38s]  homing missiles because they're very very much needed. Wait what? Where am I? Oh don't walk out.
[2169.38s -> 2174.02s]  Don't walk out and walk out the exit. Don't. No you have to do this. Don't do that again.
[2174.82s -> 2181.53s]  Back to the forest. Oh fuck we have to do this again. It's all right. I don't have a refill. No
[2181.53s -> 2189.51s]  I don't. I'm actually pretty fucked here to be honest. I don't have a refill and this is
[2189.51s -> 2204.26s]  just scripted fucking cutscene. All right here we go. I got this. I'm just going to save my
[2204.26s -> 2214.98s]  homing missiles till the next fight. Check this out. I'm not going to even use the homing. You
[2214.98s -> 2236.38s]  don't skip. Yes you do if you've seen it already. The buster fire is too short. Oh let's see. Should
[2236.38s -> 2246.54s]  I get rid of it? Let's see what I got. No I need range. I have range two. Range five. Yeah let's
[2246.54s -> 2253.94s]  do that one. Let's max out the range. Sniper scope. I'll keep the laser on and energy. What do I have?
[2253.94s -> 2271.80s]  Energy two. Attack one. Energy two. I lose the uh now this should be fine. Yeah this is fine. Now
[2271.80s -> 2280.90s]  this is these travel the whole. They go forever. Not as much rapid fire but I don't know rapid
[2280.90s -> 2287.22s]  fire is cool but I feel like you're moving and shooting. It's range is always better. All right
[2287.22s -> 2293.19s]  I'll get this now. If I don't do it this time then what I'm going to do is I'm going to upgrade
[2293.59s -> 2318.34s]  uh the homing missiles again. It's too slow. It's all right. It's okay. Let's go. I really
[2318.34s -> 2327.90s]  shouldn't get hit at all because this thing even fire. The cannon does but barely. Well it's not
[2327.90s -> 2354.47s]  the weak points aren't even activated yet. It's not active yet but this shit don't matter either.
[2357.94s -> 2361.86s]  I don't think this is not taking. It's not doing damage. It's just to prevent me from taking damage.
[2373.03s -> 2387.03s]  I don't want to use my special. All right that's fine. We'll get it all in the next go.
[2392.42s -> 2405.24s]  Oh my god look at that fucking range. Pretty good. That one. Gunners what do you think you're doing?
[2405.88s -> 2415.29s]  The sky. And there's that one. Another hit. Here we go. What kind of firepower. All right.
[2415.85s -> 2428.98s]  I just need to be careful. Dodge. Locking on doesn't work. Thank god I have homing missiles.
[2444.41s -> 2454.47s]  I'm already doing it. All right. Mission complete. Can I run in there and like talk to the monkey
[2454.47s -> 2483.56s]  real quick? Here we go. Three, two, one, go. Where are you? Where are you? Oh dude. Jesus
[2483.56s -> 2502.23s]  Christ. This is a mess. The camera. I can't even see what anything's shooting at me.
[2502.95s -> 2535.30s]  God. Dude what the fuck? Why can't I shoot these? I can't shoot the missiles. I'll get it. Just
[2535.30s -> 2552.12s]  watch out for the fucking fire. Oh my fucking god. I don't know where the fuck they are.
[2553.40s -> 2577.29s]  Jesus. Watch out. I don't have a heal. Oh my goodness. What a dirty wet sock this control is like.
[2585.42s -> 2593.90s]  I'm dead. There's not enough range.
[2594.70s -> 2614.52s]  Hi Mega Man. We can't see you. That camera needs to be like a hundred feet further out.
[2624.09s -> 2643.13s]  Skrifted. Dude. You gotta go back to that room to get the best weapon. Okay. So I'm gonna put it.
[2643.13s -> 2658.46s]  I'm gonna put every cent I own into that gun because this is annoying. What can I do?
[2660.66s -> 2677.62s]  Range. $60,000 range. Use the. I'm not gonna use the vacuum. Time to farm in the dungeon. No. I'm
[2677.62s -> 2726.55s]  not going back in there. Save it. All right. So I can't. I can't leave. Can I? I'm stuck here.
[2726.55s -> 2746.04s]  I can't go back to the market. I have to do this without a without a canteen. All right. Well,
[2746.36s -> 2757.72s]  I almost did it back there. I got upgraded damage on my gun. I'm ready. Let's go. Skip, skip, skip,
[2757.72s -> 2777.43s]  skip, skip, skip. The ship is called Gielishat. Society in German. That's pretty good tidbit.
[2782.98s -> 2786.10s]  You can't team. I physically cannot fill the canteen.
[2787.94s -> 2793.56s]  You can only fill the canteen in town. I cannot go back to town. This is me going back to town.
[2793.56s -> 2820.20s]  I cannot leave this location until I beat this guy. Also, softlock yourself. Kind of, actually.
[2821.16s -> 2827.43s]  But not really. Isn't I just I have look at the attack. I have this now. I just have to do this
[2827.43s -> 2844.70s]  again. This is the hardest boss in the game. I mean, I could see that considering it's a flying
[2844.70s -> 2873.77s]  boss that flies all over the whole screen. And this is what you have to do. Why can't you just
[2873.77s -> 2887.51s]  fly too? I know that's that's unfucking fair. Am I really Mega Man? Mega is more than super,
[2887.51s -> 2892.79s]  but yet Superman can fucking fly. Come on, Capcom. What the fuck are you thinking?
[2892.79s -> 2909.72s]  Man, it's working. Keep it up. Gunners, what do you think you're doing?
[2918.26s -> 2926.22s]  More like Mega Stupid. God, I could have one cycled that.
[2929.26s -> 2932.86s]  We don't criticize the streamer. We don't criticize the streamer. We don't criticize the streamer. We
[2932.86s -> 2957.06s]  don't criticize the streamer. Is it Mega Man's whole thing that he absorbs other people's power?
[2957.06s -> 2971.22s]  Yes, he's the engineering Kirby. He's Kirby, the engineering student. Who came first?
[2976.63s -> 2983.42s]  All right, no more fucking around. I'm getting this done. Go.
[2990.15s -> 3034.98s]  What? Oh, oh, what a good line. That's the face I was making. Was that so hard? No.
[3036.50s -> 3039.75s]  I had a really good line there.
[3053.05s -> 3085.64s]  Holy shit. Oh my god, that was fucking horrible. Oh. Jesus.
[3085.88s -> 3088.76s]  Maybe we should have taken it easier on them.
[3088.76s -> 3110.71s]  Kids game. We should have taken it easier, but they ejected, right? Nope. And now this song.
[3118.34s -> 3123.78s]  Looks like the main gate is opened at last. I'm certain the answers to all our questions can be
[3123.78s -> 3129.06s]  found inside. I bet you can't wait to get inside, eh? Are you going to check it out right away?
[3130.10s -> 3136.02s]  No. It's always a good idea to be cautious when getting into a situation you know nothing about.
[3136.02s -> 3139.14s]  Make sure you're fully prepared and equipped before you head out.
[3140.02s -> 3147.05s]  Yeah, because this is the last dungeon in the game. I'm not making that same mistake. All right,
[3147.05s -> 3159.03s]  let's go. What's a good grind spot? Hey, what do you think you're doing? What? Whoops. What?
[3159.03s -> 3168.57s]  Get out of here now. Haven't I been going in here to talk? Next time not before opening the door.
[3170.07s -> 3195.45s]  Sorry, roll. Okay. Where's the? Where's the monkey? I want to save. All right, I need a good grind.
[3195.45s -> 3201.90s]  I need a good grind spot. Do I have any items that you can use?
[3207.67s -> 3229.29s]  Sorry, I wasn't able to make anything out of what you have. Never mind. Why is this Bernie? Bernie?
[3231.58s -> 3247.59s]  Not. Why is it Bernie? All right, let's go back to town. I want to get some shit. I want to get some
[3247.59s -> 3262.82s]  money. I spent it. All right, let's go to. I want to go to downtown. He said sorry with an accent,
[3262.82s -> 3275.93s]  like sorry. Oh, chat is high as fuck. Why? So it's like 1 p.m. Pacific. What do you mean? What do you
[3275.93s -> 3298.73s]  guys? I'm going to go self. I will not confirm or deny this. You smoking weed? Are you smoking weed?
[3299.94s -> 3319.98s]  Tell me. I found this in your room. To me, this looks like a half-smoked joint. That's so expensive.
[3319.98s -> 3329.19s]  Oh, that's really good. Ah, but that's just a better version of what I have on right now.
[3329.19s -> 3343.66s]  I learned it from you, okay? Now you didn't. Sniper unit Omega. I don't have enough money.
[3346.42s -> 3350.10s]  I need the Kevlar jacket too. All right, I have to get. I have to make some money.
[3352.55s -> 3363.99s]  I have to make. I have to make some money. What do I have? Sell items. Ancient book. But I don't.
[3363.99s -> 3371.21s]  I can turn this shit into stuff. That's not enough money. I mean, I could sell the sniper scope,
[3371.21s -> 3388.09s]  but no. That's a ton of range. No, I'm just going to buy. I got to make some money.
[3388.73s -> 3400.71s]  Let's just go. You have a few dungeons to go still that will earn you money. Well, how come?
[3401.98s -> 3407.10s]  Why was grandpa like, this is it. Yeah, this is the end of the game. No turning back now. Like
[3407.10s -> 3412.01s]  they did all that they used to do. Usually when you get that piece of dialogue and you say yes,
[3412.01s -> 3418.65s]  it's like locked in. You can't go anywhere. I got like a, you're at the end of the game, say yes
[3418.65s -> 3437.34s]  from grandpa. Should I not be concerned about them? He's an old bastard. Oh, well, what does
[3437.34s -> 3456.73s]  that have to do with anything? You're thinking of new Vegas. What? Yeah, I got those walls to break
[3456.73s -> 3481.88s]  too. These cats. Wow. That was in the game. Cool. All right, grandpa, I'm ready. Are you sure you
[3481.88s -> 3498.81s]  have all the equipment you need? This will be it. Slowing down. What? Wait, so I just have to,
[3503.42s -> 3519.02s]  he's going to die. I just have to go to the main gate. Oh, okay. Well, okay. Spend time with him,
[3519.02s -> 3533.26s]  you ungrateful fuck. I, stop. All right, so I have to go to the main gate and the main gate was in
[3535.90s -> 3539.66s]  over here in like the closer woods, right? I need to put on the other piece of gear, don't I?
[3540.22s -> 3563.62s]  I also have to put on the grenade launcher because that will take out the walls. I need the grand
[3563.62s -> 3580.25s]  grenade launcher. Drill is better for walls. I don't have the drill. All right. Main gate.
[3580.33s -> 3608.71s]  See what this does. We're here. Cats. Why are the cats everywhere? Look at this. The main gates
[3608.71s -> 3619.22s]  opened up. There's a door here. Are you going to go inside? I am going to go inside after I bring
[3619.22s -> 3981.91s]  Otto upstairs because he wants to come up. I'll be right back. Hello. He also had to poop. He has
[3981.91s -> 4000.46s]  been pooped. Gross. It was you that pooped. No, it wasn't. All right. Are you ready? Let's go.
[4009.46s -> 4012.58s]  All right. New place to fucking forget where everything is. Check. Where do I go?
[4013.22s -> 4031.29s]  I was going to say what? Oh, I'm going to change my, uh, let's put on. I need the range right now.
[4031.29s -> 4060.60s]  Let's do rapid. Yeah, there we go. Are you inside of a birthday cake? Oh, I should have, no,
[4060.60s -> 4077.32s]  I should have put on the, uh, I should have put on the vacuum, right? This looks like a Kirby area.
[4078.12s -> 4080.92s]  Are you just saying that because we said Kirby and Mega Man are
[4081.80s -> 4092.01s]  distant relatives, why would you need to farm money in the final dungeon?
[4095.10s -> 4109.78s]  Is this the final dungeon? Well, there's 10,000 zenny. Well, we get Mario 64 here. We have to
[4109.78s -> 4130.54s]  get like a special item to go down. Take it off. Take the shield off. Yeah, I can go there or I
[4130.54s -> 4135.26s]  can keep going down. Let's just wrap around first and see what's over here. Another door.
[4135.98s -> 4152.52s]  Oh no, I'm going out of range. Shit. Pretty good. Pretty good wireless signal so far though.
[4152.92s -> 4182.42s]  Fuck you too. You're live? The birthday cake spiral. All right, let's, there's two doors up
[4182.42s -> 4200.97s]  there. Let's just go. No, there is no crazy into you foe show here. Every single song cannot be
[4200.97s -> 4211.78s]  crazy into you. Crazy into you foe show, foe show. All right, it works, but like still,
[4211.78s -> 4246.44s]  just because it's a beat doesn't mean you can do that. Wink? Was there? All right, this is the
[4246.44s -> 4258.58s]  bottom. I'm going to wrap up and check the other stuff. There's one huge door. I'm not going to go
[4258.58s -> 4270.44s]  in the huge door yet. We're going to go into one of, there's two doors up here. It's probably money
[4270.44s -> 4299.18s]  and shit. Oh yeah, I have skates. Whoops. What's in here? Monsters. There's a big room. I don't see
[4299.18s -> 4305.96s]  any holes or anything. Do you? This is like a doom level. Like a Wolfenstein level. All right,
[4305.96s -> 4313.53s]  what is this? Please enter commands. Operate central gate. Unlock subsidies. OS voice warning.
[4313.53s -> 4317.77s]  Unlocking the subsidy entrances may cause a breach of security protocols.
[4318.49s -> 4331.77s]  Do you still want to unlock the subsidies? Uh, sure. Command acknowledged. Unlocking subsidy
[4331.77s -> 4342.04s]  entrances. The switch I just pulled deviated the portals to the living quarters. They should have
[4342.12s -> 4346.44s]  appeared somewhere on the island. What? Guess it's time to start looking for them.
[4347.24s -> 4351.00s]  Get a look for portals? What was the other thing I could do? Please enter command.
[4351.00s -> 4358.76s]  Operate central gate. Warning. The central gate has been locked by Eden. Activation requires manual
[4358.76s -> 4379.24s]  override for use of the watcher, sleeper, and dreamer keys. Hey, I thought that was blood on
[4379.24s -> 4390.63s]  the ground. Who is it? Okay, one of these dogs. That hurt a lot. I'm just trying to like aim and fire.
[4403.21s -> 4429.16s]  Hey, if it works. If it works. That's a lot of money. All right, so this place is huge. There's
[4429.16s -> 4456.62s]  three ways to go here. How about let's go, let's go over here. Is it going out? Uh, where the hell
[4456.62s -> 4476.94s]  does this go? Okay, so this is, this goes up, but where does it put me out? Oh, this is that old
[4476.94s -> 4493.99s]  city with the dogs. This is how you get in there. Okay. Remember the dogs? How would I get in here?
[4495.18s -> 4503.61s]  I guess you can't. There is no getting in. I mean, I could, could I get, could I even get out from
[4503.61s -> 4521.16s]  here? Good to know. Is there a big door? What the hell is this? Hey, what? This is not a boss, right?
[4526.38s -> 4545.50s]  Uh oh. Don't turn on, don't turn on. Why did I think that was the machine talking?
[4545.50s -> 4559.13s]  Well, to be honest with you, Tron, I thought you did die.
[4584.30s -> 4585.74s]  I'm not ready for a boss fight right now.
[4585.74s -> 4597.69s]  No, it's not time. It's time for me to go talk to the monkey and save the game.
[4597.69s -> 4606.15s]  My masterpiece. You're welcome to try and stop us, but you won't stand a chance this time.
[4606.15s -> 4620.74s]  See you. Thanks for waiting, Teasel. Let's go. Shit. Okay. Everyone ready? We're monsters.
[4624.01s -> 4639.10s]  Ah, okay. Let's make, let's make this eat good. Just lock in and focus. Maybe it just leaves.
[4639.74s -> 4660.84s]  It's just, it's here and it's big and has lots of weapons, lots of cannons and I don't even have,
[4660.84s -> 4691.53s]  what do I have for a buster parts? All right. Okay. I need range. Bad. This is just not going
[4691.53s -> 4715.16s]  to happen. Fucking useless item to have on right now. Wow. Okay. I don't even have that upgrade
[4715.32s -> 4727.56s]  to my black jacket. Uh, shit. And I can't leave this either. I mean, I, I'm going to,
[4727.56s -> 4737.98s]  I'm going to try. I'm going to try. All about you. Stop. That's not even accurate. I'll get it.
[4741.10s -> 4797.67s]  Just take it slow. It's not a race. What is that lock on? Shield repair. Jesus. I'm barely
[4797.67s -> 4811.03s]  doing any damage really, to be honest. I might be able to still do it. This auto lock is really
[4811.03s -> 4824.82s]  not doing me any favors at all. All right. I have the worst possible fucking special weapon
[4824.82s -> 4873.51s]  onto this. I have to like jump up and shoot, I think. Head. I guess the torso. Look out. Look
[4873.51s -> 4915.38s]  out. Look out. Look out. Stake. God, what a pain in the ass it is to hit this guy. What the fuck are
[4915.38s -> 4925.45s]  you aiming at? Dude. Okay. This game has it up. I'm just going to turn it off. It's just like
[4926.17s -> 4948.73s]  left shoulder, right shoulder, mid ground. Come on. I have maximum range. Oh,
[4949.61s -> 4960.84s]  why is some of those not hurting them? Right in the center. All right. What? What? Oh fuck.
[4960.84s -> 4985.30s]  He walked into it. Okay. Shield repair. I don't have any more. Why are you not hitting it again?
[4985.30s -> 4989.70s]  Like it just locked onto his shoulder and then it's just like, oh, you know, I don't want to do that
[4989.70s -> 5011.74s]  anymore. I'm going to stand on another house. Standing on house is best strategy so far.
[5011.74s -> 5028.25s]  Make it on top of this one. Nope. I need the house to stand on. Right here? Okay. Right here.
[5028.25s -> 5043.67s]  Oh, come on. What? That's such absolute horse shit. Like dog shit. Great aiming. Great lock-on
[5043.67s -> 5070.68s]  mechanic. It's fantastic. What is it doing? I can't even control where these bullets are going. It
[5070.68s -> 5089.86s]  just picks where it wants to shoot. It's like Mega Man's just guessing. I can't aim up. The game
[5089.86s -> 5141.88s]  automatically shoots where it wants to. Ah, I turned it off. I turned the fucking thing off.
[5142.92s -> 5153.62s]  What the fuck? I just turned it off. Why is it doing it still? What are you doing? Stop.
[5154.34s -> 5208.57s]  Come for those fucking grenades. Game. Why are you doing this? Shoot the spine? It just picks
[5208.57s -> 5229.56s]  randomly where it wants to shoot. He's going to break this building. I gotta go. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.
[5237.80s -> 5272.23s]  Stop shooting. Come down. Shoot him in the foot. Good. Great job. Aim at his spine and shoot him
[5272.23s -> 5297.82s]  in the foot. No, aim at his spine and like four out of ten shots are going to aim at his foot.
[5299.10s -> 5321.29s]  Just because I feel like it. I feel like shooting straight. Look at how far back this shit is too.
[5321.85s -> 5332.15s]  The active buster makes that fight a joke. I sure would have loved to have put it on.
[5333.11s -> 5336.71s]  Ah, but I was putting, I put on like the put on the
[5339.38s -> 5364.49s]  grenade launcher because I got to go break walls. Whoops. Here's the fucking boss. Now I'm going to
[5364.49s -> 5385.88s]  go kill him in probably less than 10 seconds. Hopefully he has two phases. So do I. All right.
[5385.88s -> 5400.39s]  What do I got? I'm going to keep the range on. Thankfully this is just walking a circle.
[5414.07s -> 5420.18s]  Turn around. Do the turn.
[5424.47s -> 5426.46s]  All right. Turn.
[5449.66s -> 5475.06s]  Have to defeat all enemies. Well, I want to get the money. I need zenny otherwise I can't upgrade
[5475.06s -> 5512.62s]  anymore. Oh yeah. I'll do it. All right. It's time to win. I'm going to make this an absolute joke.
[5512.62s -> 5547.54s]  Wait. No, this is the first. Oh, double door. There's two doors. What's in this box? That's
[5547.54s -> 5556.36s]  not hitting you. This music sucks. All right. Yeah. This, this song sucks. I'll get that to you.
[5557.74s -> 5564.44s]  This is a, this is a sample of the same three seconds. Buster unit omega.
[5568.55s -> 5569.91s]  This, it's pretty bad.
[5575.85s -> 5585.70s]  That's it. This did the whole song. Buster unit omega. Attack in range plus three. Holy shit.
[5586.66s -> 5610.22s]  Take off the sniper unit then. We're gonna max attack in max range. No energy though. No,
[5610.22s -> 5621.75s]  we'll keep on the blizzard. Max range, max damage, but slow shooting. Is there an energy and range
[5621.75s -> 5635.29s]  one? Energy and rapid attack and energy. Energy and range sniper unit. It'll be fine. It'll be
[5635.29s -> 5649.56s]  fine. It's bad. That's who cares. Looks cool too. All right. We're good. All right. Let's get going.
[5650.36s -> 5663.83s]  I'm starting. All right. I'm going to kill this motherfucker now. I'm just going to get in a good
[5663.83s -> 5686.28s]  spot and spam hoeing missiles at his chest and win. The ultimate in auto lock on. Smoke meth.
[5687.16s -> 5692.44s]  Don't smoke meth. Don't like, do not do that. That's like the worst thing you could ever do.
[5693.48s -> 5705.37s]  Unlock the gate. All right. I have to get the three keys. The watcher, the sleeper and the dreamer.
[5708.66s -> 5712.98s]  Unlock all the subsidies. Someone's calling me but I can't answer it.
[5716.76s -> 5735.43s]  Open the gates. Yes. The music's driving me nuts. All right. Okay. How much money would it take for
[5735.43s -> 5743.83s]  you to have two headphones in and have this song play over and over and over again without stopping
[5743.83s -> 5748.07s]  in your ears? Not like super loud, but loud enough where it's the only thing you can really hear.
[5749.67s -> 5764.49s]  For like six straight hours. 100 bucks? 500 bucks? 1000 bucks? People saying 2k?
[5773.22s -> 5791.93s]  Seven dollars? Why would you accept it? That's not worth it. All right. Let's go. No more fucking
[5791.93s -> 5798.38s]  around. Wait. A little bit more fucking around. There's other stuff in here that might help me
[5798.38s -> 5825.99s]  on my journey. Maybe just a little bit more fucking around. Got me stuck. I take a lot of damage from
[5825.99s -> 5852.38s]  this. Mega Man, Mega Man, Mega Man, Mega Man, Mega Man, Mega Man, Mega Man. You're dancing with
[5852.38s -> 5873.45s]  us right now? Keep it up. Shiny red stone. Good thing you're an idiot. All right. Don't be greedy.
[5874.68s -> 5884.73s]  Eventually comes through. This is a good chunk of change. I'm not. Should I? I think I'm gonna
[5884.73s -> 5897.32s]  upgrade. Don't be an idiot. You know what I mean? Like, don't be stupid. That's what I would say.
[5897.32s -> 5909.24s]  Is go get the, go get the upgrade. Go get the actual damage reducer. Who's over here? You hear
[5909.24s -> 5926.46s]  that? Yeah. Okay. Who is it? Oh, it's just a little guy. Hole and chest. All right. Nice. So,
[5926.70s -> 5935.80s]  I've explored. Auto fire barrel. Yeah. I mean, we got stuff too. I can run right to the boss very
[5935.80s -> 5941.26s]  quickly. Blunted drill. Didn't somebody say get drill, get drill, drill best item in game?
[5942.22s -> 5952.63s]  Because that's it. Somebody came in here and was like, dude, does he have the drill? He doesn't
[5952.63s -> 5968.54s]  have the drill. What a, what an idiot. I said that. Oh, what do you think? Should I just like go kill
[5968.54s -> 5976.95s]  boss? I think I can do it. What do you think? Go kill boss. Go kill boss. Let's go. I'm just gonna
[5976.95s -> 6002.66s]  do it. I'm fucking, no, no, no excuses. I'm doing it. Generator part. Let me just check up here.
[6003.30s -> 6011.61s]  This is a secret. Of course it's too bad. I don't have the thing that I had on before,
[6011.61s -> 6019.21s]  so I can't do this shortcut. Get your omega lulz ready chat. No, no, no, no, no, no. You get your
[6019.21s -> 6026.42s]  like, wow, he killed that boss in like 30 seconds and didn't take one point of damage. And one of
[6026.42s -> 6033.74s]  his eyes was closed. This is a pretty good grind spot actually, because these guys respond.
[6034.54s -> 6054.10s]  People are gonna be like, wait, hold on. I've been a Mega Man Legends fan for two decades. I didn't
[6054.10s -> 6064.02s]  even know you could do that to this boss. Yeah, let's fucking go. Let's go. Fuck it. Let's go.
[6064.02s -> 6067.38s]  Let's go. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. No, no, save. No, no, no, no.
[6070.22s -> 6091.96s]  Check this out. You know what I'm saying? Like, fuck it. You know what I'm saying?
[6091.96s -> 6123.90s]  I'm doing it. Let's do it. One, two, three, begin. It turns out the homing missiles are absolute dog
[6123.90s -> 6132.68s]  shit. They're not even aiming at it. Like, they're homing missiles. Why are they just going straight?
[6133.56s -> 6165.03s]  What? I didn't feel the canteen. Why is the canteen not filled? What's going on? Why is
[6165.03s -> 6171.96s]  the canteen not filled? I say, what? No, I'm like being dead serious. Why is the canteen at zero?
[6172.68s -> 6193.16s]  Did I not? Um, range. Oh my god. Unbelievable. Oh no fucking way. I really thought it was
[6193.16s -> 6203.14s]  going to be fucking easy. Oh, no way. That's so bad. Oh, this sucks. Absolute asshole. Nice fucking
[6203.14s -> 6213.21s]  lock on. Oh my god. I'm so fucking sad right now. Like, oh my god. You can't be serious.
[6214.33s -> 6225.45s]  That's un-fucking-believeable. I thought because I had the homing thing on it was going to be real
[6225.45s -> 6230.97s]  and I just upgraded its damage. Did I even upgrade the damage or what? Oh my fucking god.
[6231.61s -> 6237.82s]  Oh, this sucks. I thought it was going to be so easy with the homing missile and the damage upgrade.
[6237.82s -> 6256.47s]  Oh my god. That's so sad. I'm so actually sad. Oh my god. No. I have to go through that again.
[6256.47s -> 6267.80s]  Oh man. Why? Why? It's because auto-aim's not on? What? It's a homing missile. It's on.
[6268.52s -> 6287.22s]  Am I even going to finish this game in the next like hour and a half because of this shit? I can't
[6287.22s -> 6292.50s]  believe this shit. And now I have to go back to fill the canteen. Why is the canteen not filled?
[6292.50s -> 6306.79s]  Didn't I save it? Didn't I save the game before? When I filled the canteen up, I didn't come back
[6306.79s -> 6336.63s]  and save the game. What? I bought other stuff too. It's easily like three plus hours after this boss.
[6336.63s -> 6353.38s]  What? I thought I had like an hour left in the game. Well, how is the canteen already full?
[6353.38s -> 6370.55s]  I didn't refill it. Oh, it's because I bought the upgrade. Yeah, I'm streaming again tonight.
[6371.93s -> 6375.93s]  I'm streaming again tonight. I'm coming back after all my doctor shit and I'm going to
[6375.93s -> 6384.38s]  finish this fucking game. I'll be back. Not yet, but you know, I don't want to play this tomorrow.
[6385.02s -> 6404.33s]  We're doing black and white tomorrow. We're uh, all right, back in there. He hates this game so
[6404.33s -> 6409.94s]  he's streaming it twice in one day. No, it just, it's going to screw up the whole schedule for the
[6409.94s -> 6423.14s]  week if I don't finish it today. Oh no, I have to redo all these fucking upgrades. This sucks.
[6425.82s -> 6432.02s]  Actually, I can't even do it, can I? No, I can't even do it again. No, I did already do it.
[6432.58s -> 6447.88s]  Okay, sir. Save my game. You don't have to finish it. I'm at like the last two to three hours of
[6447.88s -> 6480.66s]  the game. I've got to finish the game. He's thinking about giving up. No, I'm responding.
[6480.66s -> 6487.46s]  I'm just, what? I'm responding to somebody that says give up and I said no, I'm not giving up.
[6487.46s -> 6496.28s]  I said the complete opposite of what you just said. Okay, we're going to do this smart. We're
[6496.28s -> 6535.24s]  going to do this fucking smart. Smart but quick. Are you ready? Smart but quick. Smart and quick.
[6541.34s -> 6545.66s]  I've got to beat it in 30 seconds. Oh yeah, I don't need to save. What the fuck, man? Don't,
[6545.66s -> 6551.34s]  this is, this game is 20 years old. Don't ever underestimate like the amount of random dumb
[6551.34s -> 6558.42s]  shit that can happen in a 20 year old fucking game. Like this is not, this is not like fall
[6558.42s -> 6562.58s]  into order where if I jump off the cliff, I just reappear instantly right behind where I fell off.
[6562.58s -> 6576.02s]  You know what I mean? Like, what am I thinking? It's 20 years old. They didn't give a shit 20
[6576.02s -> 6603.96s]  years ago. Sometimes I forget. I have to get all the items though. Open, open, open, open, open,
[6603.96s -> 6611.21s]  open, open. Turn the music off. You want to hear it for very much longer, I promise.
[6618.22s -> 6627.78s]  5,000 bits. $50 just came in. I gave $50. Jaredon, thanks for the 5,000 bits, dude.
[6628.58s -> 6634.22s]  That's a $50 bit drop. I just picked it up. Oh, these really are bits. Holy shit.
[6634.54s -> 6640.47s]  Okay, that's weird. How have I not made that joke the whole time? They say the reason the weapons
[6640.47s -> 6645.51s]  keep auto locking through his speed is because he has bomb cannons on his feet. Destroy those first
[6645.51s -> 6649.99s]  with your mega buster before you use the homing missiles. You have to shoot them from the front
[6649.99s -> 6666.55s]  to hit them. Mega buster. Uh, good tip. Good tip. Thank you. And thanks for the huge amount of money.
[6667.27s -> 6681.67s]  All right, where is it? I want to take off. Uh, there it is. Oink. Max attack, max range.
[6683.93s -> 6698.28s]  You suck, omega low. Wait, did I get everything in that room? Was there a hole?
[6701.78s -> 6708.28s]  You stink. Can you guys start, instead of saying you suck, omega low, can you guys just start doing
[6708.28s -> 6715.05s]  you stink with auto? You stink. That's, I like that more. Can you do that, Noah? Can you do that
[6715.05s -> 6727.78s]  instead? Uh, I'm going back up. I just have to turn off the gates too. Let me do that first.
[6727.78s -> 6733.72s]  And I'm going to come back and save it. Don't worry. And now I don't, I don't have to worry
[6734.92s -> 6739.66s]  about, um, I don't have to worry about time constraints because I'm just going to come back
[6739.66s -> 6757.54s]  and fucking finish the damn game. Is this the first time I'm ever going to do a double stream
[6757.54s -> 6767.88s]  in the same day? There's like two streams, two separate streams. Have I done that before?
[6768.20s -> 6778.17s]  The switch I just pulled should have activated the portals to the living quarters. First one that's
[6778.17s -> 6781.29s]  not an internet issue, yeah. It should have appeared somewhere on the island.
[6781.93s -> 6815.69s]  Guess it's time to start looking for them. Let's fight this guy. Look, a lot of money too. I'm
[6815.69s -> 6826.14s]  preparing. There's like 20,000, $30,000 down here. I'm going to get it. And I'm going to, yeah, yeah,
[6826.14s -> 6840.18s]  be smart about this. I want the items. There's like two items down here. It's like a shiny stone.
[6846.78s -> 6852.66s]  Can a dog eat a lemon? I don't, I don't fucking know. Probably no. I'll probably not. Don't give
[6852.66s -> 6855.62s]  me a dog. Why are you giving a dog a lemon? Don't do that. What are you talking about?
[6855.62s -> 6857.80s]  I don't know. Why are you asking me?
[6872.73s -> 6912.17s]  Not a problem. I beat this game when I was six. No, you didn't.
[6916.20s -> 6919.24s]  If I was like sports betting on the fact if you beat this game and you were six,
[6919.24s -> 6924.66s]  I would put every cent I own on it. You rented this game from Blockbuster when you were six
[6924.66s -> 6928.66s]  and got past the first tutorial level and then went to bed. And then your mother returned it
[6929.22s -> 6933.46s]  two days later. That's what happened. That's what happened to all of us. So come on.
[6934.02s -> 6967.75s]  This is what happened. Don't go in that door. Did I miss anything else? All right. Well,
[6967.75s -> 6976.90s]  there was an item. Um, all right. Time to go back. Okay. Yes. That door, that door, left door,
[6976.90s -> 6982.98s]  left door. What, what, what? This door, left door, left door. VR Josh, I'm trusting you with my life
[6982.98s -> 6991.35s]  here. Why am I going in this door? Is this left door's items? All right. Liar? Liar. Did you lie
[6991.35s -> 7002.14s]  to me? No, you didn't. Thank God. What a trustworthy individual. VR Josh is a known liar.
[7008.18s -> 7012.98s]  No, no, he's not. I can't do that. All right. We're good. Save the fucking game.
[7012.98s -> 7030.17s]  Save the fucking game. VIP that guy. No, don't. Okay. Hold on. I have to get out of this.
[7031.22s -> 7038.90s]  Escape. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I think he's going to hit me with a flame
[7038.90s -> 7047.85s]  throw. She's crying. Jesus Christ. Somebody said it and it makes me laugh. All right. Saving games.
[7049.21s -> 7085.03s]  I don't care. Just get me out. Just give me the big ones. Fast and smart. Wait, isn't this going,
[7085.59s -> 7107.93s]  this is going down. I knew I was going to run into that guy.
[7108.89s -> 7149.72s]  Okay, here we go. Dumb and slow. Can I make any new items? Here you go Mega Man. The blunted drill
[7149.72s -> 7157.32s]  is used to make drill arm. You can't use it in combat unless you get right next to your opponent.
[7158.04s -> 7164.49s]  I don't know. Maybe you can think of another good use for it. Auto fire and generator part we use
[7164.49s -> 7170.25s]  to make the buster part auto battery. This part will increase the number of shots you can fire
[7170.25s -> 7176.12s]  once to the max. With this you can fire a constant stream of energy. Oh shit, really?
[7189.54s -> 7201.32s]  Wait, no, I don't want to do the Mega Man voice acting line thing. Let me check it out.
[7208.98s -> 7217.54s]  All right, so this is energy, attack and range, attack, attack and range. So could I, let's see,
[7217.54s -> 7230.10s]  where is it? Auto battery. I mean, that's, let's see. I can't even test it. I think I want to try
[7230.10s -> 7238.36s]  it. All right, the game has been saved. How much money do I have? 36. That's just enough. That is
[7238.36s -> 7259.98s]  just enough to get the flak jacket. $36,000, just enough. Save again after you buy the jacket. I will.
[7260.86s -> 7279.18s]  I won't forget. It reminds me of like a dentist drilling my teeth. I don't like that noise.
[7279.98s -> 7296.78s]  Here we go. Kevlar jacket. Done. There's another one. Kevlar jacket Omega.
[7297.50s -> 7328.90s]  Canteen is full. It's equipped, right? Toilet seat. Now he's broke. Yep. Take us back to the
[7328.90s -> 7334.09s]  runes, save the game. We'll take us back to the runes, then save again. And I'm going for it.
[7334.73s -> 7364.76s]  Take us to the main gate. Okay. It's time. It's time. Have I checked the museum? Some of that stuff
[7364.76s -> 7380.30s]  goes to the museum. I don't know where the museum is. Memory card. Let's go kill this boss. Let's
[7380.30s -> 7386.52s]  go kill this boss. I'm ready. I have the damage reducer. I'm just going to get over there. I opened
[7386.52s -> 7396.26s]  up these, those sub gates already, right? Real wink. Take wink. Whatever. All right, here we go.
[7397.45s -> 7448.41s]  Smart, quick, fast, and to the point. Quick, fast, and to the point. I'm ready. No more excuses.
[7448.41s -> 7463.64s]  It's time to like drink a Pacific Gatorade and do this. Remember, shoot the cannons on the boots
[7463.64s -> 7484.47s]  first. You got it. What's going on? Okay. This like, this fucking lip is, that's what's going on. The
[7484.47s -> 7526.36s]  lip there. I love how the camera does that too. Kill that boss in 30 seconds. This guy sucks. All
[7526.36s -> 7589.40s]  right. Am I even hitting the cannons on his feet? I'm still doing it. What am I doing? I'm listening
[7589.40s -> 7595.74s]  to the one person that said to destroy the cannons on his feet first. Did I not listen to the one
[7595.74s -> 7623.93s]  person who told me to do it? Here goes one. My God, why? Auto lock is turned off. Shoot the, what the
[7623.93s -> 7637.99s]  fuck, Mega Man? Shoot the thing on his foot. What are you fucking aiming at? Dude, shoot.
[7639.19s -> 7666.60s]  It's on his foot. Shoot his foot. What the fuck, Mega Man? It's just, what do you want me to tell
[7666.60s -> 7672.84s]  you? How do I, what do you want me to tell you? What do you want me to say? Sorry, but I'm going
[7672.92s -> 7703.88s]  to apologize for this. I told you it was going to take 30 seconds. No. Stupid. I told you it was
[7703.88s -> 7712.57s]  going to work. He was right. Nobody talked shit about the one guy. He was right. It was shooting
[7712.57s -> 7722.78s]  at the cannons on his feet and homing on them. Okay, Blue. You must know. What's your name?
[7723.50s -> 7730.84s]  Me? My name is Mega Man. Mega Man Volnut. Mega Man, is it? You know, I've been in this business
[7730.84s -> 7736.92s]  a long time, but this is the first time anyone's ever given me this much trouble. Yet it feels
[7736.92s -> 7750.14s]  good somehow being bliss, almost as though I've met my match. I can face the facts. I lost. You
[7750.14s -> 7759.62s]  won. I'm going to try to beat this guy before he stops saying this. To say that feels as clean as
[7759.62s -> 7784.01s]  the blue sky on a cloudless day. See you around. Which one's Tron and which one's Bon? Both?
[7784.97s -> 7792.02s]  I'll never see him again. Okay, that's Tron. Once he finds the treasure, we'll wait for our
[7792.02s -> 7803.26s]  chance and take it from him. What? I was going to just walk away, did you? It's a full name.
[7805.58s -> 7811.66s]  You bet it is. Old Teasel never gives up. So it's Teasel Bon, Tron Bon, and Bon Bon.
[7814.30s -> 7828.15s]  Did I get any money for that? I don't think I even got any money for that.
[7829.03s -> 7854.18s]  All right, so now, um, let's go. Let's go. What the fuck is this? No, no, no, no, no.
[7855.46s -> 7858.18s]  Security breach detected. Unauthorized exit not permitted.
[7869.53s -> 7883.37s]  What? I can't leave? Why? I just want to, I just opened the door. Oh no. What happened? Why?
[7884.33s -> 7896.02s]  What do you mean I can't leave? Oh, okay. Just play good. I'm going to be very careful.
[7896.98s -> 7925.80s]  It's not about the money right now. It's about surviving. It is about money. Who the fuck am I
[7925.80s -> 7959.42s]  kidding? Did I get it? Um, where am I? I would be taken though. In here, this building looks
[7959.42s -> 7964.78s]  different. So how do I get inside? I don't know. How do I get out and save the game?
[7964.78s -> 7986.58s]  I have to clear this dungeon to leave. No, I don't. Do I? No, I don't. I don't say that.
[7987.46s -> 8002.33s]  It would mean the whole thing. Or just here. All right, I'm going to, I'm going to be such
[8002.33s -> 8024.33s]  a coward this whole time. No risks, no mistakes. I'm going to be the ultimate coward. Do I still
[8024.33s -> 8031.78s]  have shield repair? I don't. I don't. But I do have, um, it's like four health bars to heal.
[8031.78s -> 8043.45s]  No. Yeah, that's fine. You can call me a mega coward if you want. I'm not relining like 45
[8043.45s -> 8058.95s]  minutes. Oh my God. All right, where do I want to go from here? I got to get in that building.
[8061.51s -> 8072.25s]  This one looks different than the other. It's probably the guy I jump in like the top or
[8072.25s -> 8084.44s]  something, right? Jump in the top. This building looks different. I can go in the top. Just say
[8084.44s -> 8093.08s]  it Mega Man. Help me. This one looks different than all the others.
[8114.01s -> 8119.56s]  Isn't there another enemy? There's one more guy. Where's this, where's this one guy?
[8123.50s -> 8132.36s]  Oh, I hit one guy. Spam it. Spam it. I can leave, right? Okay.
[8134.60s -> 8168.50s]  Shit, there's a dog blocking the door. All right, get me out of here. Get me out. I want to get out.
[8169.14s -> 8178.57s]  I need to go, uh, west. I missed weapons. Don't worry. I'll be back. I'm going back there anyways.
[8179.37s -> 8203.03s]  Can I go west from here? Go west from here. Mega Man has lilies on. Uh, sometimes.
[8204.31s -> 8225.69s]  Wait, is there a way to get out of here? All right, come pick me up and heal me and
[8225.69s -> 8251.99s]  fill up the canteen and go back there. Pick me up. Item dab. Got some new stuff. Nothing.
[8251.99s -> 8258.50s]  I hope you're ready to do that again because you, you didn't do the reward. That's fine. I mean, I,
[8259.14s -> 8263.46s]  the save point I have is before I fought the last boss. So that takes priority over anything.
[8264.18s -> 8286.62s]  Checking, saving. I'm all right. That, that didn't, that wasn't too bad. Do that again.
[8287.26s -> 8298.01s]  All right. What about, what do I, what do I have for money? 13,000. Not enough. We have to keep
[8298.01s -> 8318.95s]  going. So we're going to go east. Back where I was. Excuse me. Whoa, Mega Man in 3D. What the fuck?
[8318.95s -> 8323.72s]  Yep. I know. It's pretty spectacular. And then from here, we got to go,
[8324.84s -> 8327.56s]  where was it? North? Was it right here? No, it was over here, wasn't it?
[8328.44s -> 8362.04s]  Wasn't it, was it north or was it south? I think it was south. Oh, it was just right here. Oh,
[8362.04s -> 8366.60s]  it was just right here. Yeah. Some reason I thought there was another place to go.
[8367.72s -> 8397.19s]  All right, here we go. Stay up here. I have maximum range.
[8397.19s -> 8417.88s]  I don't care. It's fine. Everybody's my friend. Thank you. More money, more money, more money.
[8418.68s -> 8470.46s]  Hello. Real Wink? Liars. You idiots cried wolf too many times.
[8472.46s -> 8487.48s]  The boy, the boys who cried Wink. Guys, they made nursery rhymes about this shit. Like,
[8487.48s -> 8506.42s]  haven't you figured it out by now? Come on. There's one more tank. Where was that tank?
[8507.30s -> 8525.93s]  Is there somebody else on top of a building? No. I hear him. Where was he? I just heard him.
[8525.93s -> 8533.80s]  He's like hiding over here somewhere. Oh, there's one over there.
[8544.81s -> 8556.71s]  Controls this game look so funky. They are. It's, it's R1 and L1 to turn. And then obviously forward
[8556.71s -> 8564.70s]  and back, left and right. Now I can, I could have it left and right be turned, but I tried it and it
[8564.70s -> 8570.70s]  was, it just didn't feel right. Free analog controls. Yeah. All right. What's this last
[8570.70s -> 8595.26s]  thing? Yeah. It's really, it's, it's the, it's the turning that's the worst, but it's okay. It's not
[8595.26s -> 8599.98s]  like the worst thing in the world. The only, really the only time where it's bad is when that enemy
[8599.98s -> 8608.86s]  was flying around all over the place. It's like R1, L1, R1. Ooh. Your brain, like at this point
[8608.86s -> 8623.75s]  playing this many games without doing this, doesn't want to do it. Double wink. All right.
[8623.75s -> 8640.58s]  Where's his last person? All right. Anybody see anybody? You? Over here? Oh, there you are.
[8641.54s -> 8659.30s]  It's like hiding over here. Why are you not even moving around? A noise was just made. Something
[8659.30s -> 8679.94s]  happened. Ooh. You found the watcher key. Got it. To the surface. Oh, so that's what you mean when
[8679.94s -> 8683.94s]  you guys said you just have to go in and get it. But I thought it could have been another dungeon.
[8686.25s -> 8702.41s]  That's all it is. Okay. All right. I need two more of those. Tell the other side. This is,
[8702.49s -> 8709.03s]  there's another door here, right? Is this going this one? Did I go in here? This is where I was
[8709.03s -> 8722.95s]  before. Can I go down any further? I actually forget where the other subsidies are. Well,
[8722.95s -> 8730.06s]  it says that just around the world, like the town, right? Just join. This game sucks.
[8733.29s -> 8739.21s]  How would you know that if you just got here? Hey, just opened up the browser. Hey, this game sucks.
[8740.09s -> 8761.86s]  Really? You haven't even seen it. What did I just say? Load twitch.tv. The Samsung Galaxy Galaxy S1
[8761.86s -> 8770.15s]  2. Buy a 5 second, 15 second Twitch ad. This game sucks. No, you didn't even see it.
[8785.13s -> 8797.35s]  You never rebuilt the city? No, I don't have any money for that. Oh, look. Save it. You guys think
[8797.35s -> 8803.19s]  I have money to rebuild the city? I need to like take care of me so I can beat the monsters and
[8803.19s -> 8812.22s]  then I'll take care of the city. Put your oxygen mask on first before putting another oxygen mask
[8812.22s -> 8828.92s]  on to another passenger. If I'm going to, I take care of, there's people attacking the city still.
[8828.92s -> 8840.09s]  I have to do that. I'm going to come back and I'm going to rebuild. This monkey is punchable? Why?
[8840.09s -> 8865.02s]  What? It's the super monkey ball monkey. What are you talking about? All right. Let's go. Here we go.
[8866.90s -> 8877.11s]  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Okay, I'm done. I'm just trying to like make it over exaggerated.
[8879.30s -> 8892.14s]  I did that anyways. I don't have to like pretend. Push. Okay. Pay attention. He's having fun again.
[8892.14s -> 8899.66s]  Bog. I was having fun the whole time. Just fucking stupid and can't pay attention to anything.
[8909.21s -> 8918.89s]  You're a pain in the ass. You're a pain in the ass. How much of a pain in the ass do you have to
[8918.89s -> 8942.92s]  be? I'm going to the building. Oh my god. That's max attack. Pain in the ass. Should I like over
[8942.92s -> 8946.60s]  react the fuck out of everything going on right now and like if somebody trickles into the screen,
[8946.60s -> 8970.90s]  they're going to think I'm like a fucking herd. All right. All right. All right. Fuck. Whoa, whoa,
[8970.90s -> 8985.38s]  whoa. Guy behind. Whoa. Oh my god. What the fuck? Okay. Oh, I got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it.
[8985.38s -> 8995.40s]  Oh, he's coming out. Oh no. Come on. I got to get the items. This guy dropped. I didn't get any.
[8996.92s -> 9008.15s]  Oh, whoopsie. Fuck. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[9009.19s -> 9016.76s]  This is kind of normal though, isn't it? It's just like, isn't this like kind of normal?
[9017.56s -> 9024.52s]  It's like I do this. I like do this stuff. There's no difference. I do this shit. Not like that
[9024.52s -> 9030.60s]  ridiculous, but I've like done that before. Uh oh. No pretending anymore.
[9033.54s -> 9040.31s]  I thought it was normal. How do you like, how do I overreact more than me overreacting all the time?
[9041.78s -> 9046.10s]  Like, especially when it was like that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I think I did that like
[9046.10s -> 9067.02s]  three days ago. All right. This guy's actually going to kill me. Well, nobody even joined the
[9067.02s -> 9072.28s]  stream. So, hey, there you go guys. I hope you thought that was interesting. Not one person
[9072.28s -> 9086.65s]  trickled into the stream. I didn't even do that for any reason. Wait, hold on. I can fix this.
[9087.29s -> 9102.92s]  Give me a second. I can fix this. Trust me. You're going to want to wait for this one.
[9102.92s -> 9142.23s]  Go like this. Hold on a second. I'll fix it. It has to be a little bit pixelated though.
[9143.35s -> 9186.18s]  Now I got to get this mapped in my stream deck. Important. Just trust me. I'll fix it. Okay.
[9186.18s -> 9210.70s]  Okay. All right. So, that's good. Okay. Dude, this guy is fucking stupid. Did it work? Okay.
[9210.70s -> 9220.50s]  Oh. Oh, shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, guys. I've got to fight this guy.
[9220.50s -> 9223.94s]  No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Watch out. Watch out. He's behind me. Behind me. Behind me.
[9227.05s -> 9238.78s]  Yeah. Yeah. That's, now that's what I'm talking about. Get destroyed, idiot. Guys, guys. I don't
[9238.78s -> 9252.87s]  think that we have a chance at all here. Oh, I got him. Cool. Cool. Cool. Anymore? Are there any,
[9252.87s -> 9268.66s]  are there any more? Are there any more? I never understood that. Why? Why does every YouTube video
[9268.66s -> 9274.68s]  now with the face cam have to go like fucking this and zoom into their face? Like every five seconds.
[9278.07s -> 9286.39s]  Why? And it's not even like a zoom. It's actually like pulled and stretched webcam like this.
[9293.99s -> 9309.46s]  You just got plus 40 viewers. Like, why, why do we all do this? Wait, this is in my last video?
[9310.58s -> 9315.96s]  This is, wait, this is in my last video? Wait, hold on a second, guys. Whoa. This is in my last
[9315.96s -> 9330.02s]  video. Wait a minute. I got to, I got to have to speak to those editors. This is,
[9331.38s -> 9358.87s]  all right. Where's this last person? You need to react. No reactions. Anybody see anybody? Ah,
[9358.87s -> 9368.73s]  found you. Do something funny. Wait. No, no, I didn't. I know that that's real though. That's me.
[9369.61s -> 9373.93s]  Guys, I do that shit when I do the laundry. If like a sock drops, I go like, oh shit.
[9374.97s -> 9380.89s]  I have like ADHD, neurotic. Like that's just who I am. That's me. I'm not making that up.
[9385.98s -> 9403.43s]  He's an IRL tuber. Don't you have a doctor's appointment? Yeah, I'm all right. I got time.
[9405.14s -> 9416.68s]  One more. So where's this last hole? Are you prepared? Are you prepared? Oh, I love that.
[9417.24s -> 9434.94s]  Are you prepared? And sometimes it goes, are you like, they just cut off immediately. I love it.
[9434.94s -> 9441.93s]  Are you prepared? Are you prepared? We don't know what I'm talking about. I mean, I'm a little
[9441.93s -> 9456.58s]  neurotic. You know, that's what we do here. Fringe monkey, cringe monkey. What? Why is he's dancing?
[9457.46s -> 9469.67s]  Come on. Give me a break. What are you talking about? What's wrong with everybody? Let him dance.
[9469.67s -> 9475.69s]  He is dancing. He's fine. I'm fine. My appointment's not, I got plenty of time. Don't worry.
[9478.01s -> 9482.57s]  If I don't finish this in the next like 30 minutes, then whatever. I'll come back. I'll turn the
[9482.57s -> 9487.45s]  stream on in like a few hours. That's not a joke, by the way. That's actually going to happen.
[9488.25s -> 9507.35s]  All right. So is there one here? No, I'm not playing this tomorrow. So if I can't beat this
[9507.35s -> 9511.42s]  before my appointment, I'm just going to come back and finish it later. We're doing black and
[9511.42s -> 9534.39s]  white two tomorrow. The return of Murius. I don't see. Is it here? Somebody said the check report
[9535.11s -> 9573.00s]  out here. You know what shirt you have to wear tomorrow? No, I don't. Up here somewhere in
[9573.00s -> 9596.87s]  Uptown. But where? Let's skate around and find out. All right. If I get hit by a car while
[9596.87s -> 9608.02s]  searching, I will, I will give 500,000 community subs. All right. I'm like fucking scared.
[9609.38s -> 9619.26s]  I'm going to stop. All right. I just passed it. I just went fired. That's, that's like fucking
[9619.26s -> 9626.87s]  50 million dollars or something. No, I saw it. I knew where it was. Who's here is going to pop
[9626.87s -> 9635.16s]  in gamer. Did I save it? Yes. All right. Good. We have a boss battle. Oh, it's a giant centipede.
[9635.16s -> 9641.56s]  You're going to shoot it in the butt. Absolutely need to shoot it in the butt. I don't have this
[9641.56s -> 9646.52s]  singled out in my mind that you don't shoot it. They mean right there in the butt and it's back
[9646.52s -> 9660.79s]  or whatever it is. Yep. Easy. Oh, this little dinky guy over here got me.
[9666.34s -> 9686.82s]  This is grind city. I just take the vacuum. Just do this forever. Right? Right? It's free money.
[9687.38s -> 9701.10s]  There's not much money from these guys. Wait, not much money from these guys at all.
[9701.34s -> 9703.66s]  Game doesn't even hold up 20 years later. Unbelievable.
[9704.86s -> 9719.00s]  Easily getting overwhelmed here without being able to shoot at the thing.
[9719.80s -> 9727.77s]  I feel like I need a grenade launcher for this. That's not a terror. That's pretty good actually.
[9730.14s -> 9741.50s]  I didn't pick up any of it, but it was still pretty good. If I had the vacuum, I would just be like,
[9742.14s -> 9774.02s]  I'd just suck it all up right now. Oh, let's do something else. You're behind me. Oh, he is.
[9774.02s -> 9822.76s]  All right. Oh, come on. What's with those pixels? Don't kill it. Please. Whoa. All right.
[9822.76s -> 9843.10s]  They're still here. I really needed the vacuum for this. Those other people were okay. We've got
[9843.10s -> 9850.25s]  tuber DNA. I mean, I did YouTube videos for like six years.
[9856.58s -> 9862.42s]  And then I did Twitch for like five. I've been on that. That's 11 years. That's not real.
[9865.10s -> 9875.21s]  All right. I got all the keys. Now I go. Go back to that. I know where that is.
[9875.77s -> 9894.57s]  Am I going to finish this before I have to leave? Well, maybe if I play well.
[9896.84s -> 9902.04s]  This is the end game for your information. There's a lot to do if you want, but it's optional.
[9904.06s -> 9907.58s]  Well, I'll come back and we'll finish it all up and clean it up. That's fine.
[9908.70s -> 9933.45s]  I'm all right with that. This level is ugly. There's a mini game at the TV station. All right.
[9934.25s -> 9945.96s]  We've been waiting for you. You're one of the contestants for our hit show, Dangerous Games.
[9949.05s -> 9958.81s]  I'm not a contestant. Hey, you look like you're a pretty good runner. Do you want to try out for
[9958.81s -> 9964.33s]  my show? It's a race through the city streets. What do you say? Yeah, sure. Great. Come on then.
[9964.33s -> 9978.07s]  Let's go. Do you want to hear the rules? Yes. This game is a timed race through the city streets.
[9978.07s -> 9982.79s]  The object is to pass through the course marked by the red cones within the time limit.
[9983.67s -> 9987.99s]  Yellow cones are bonus cones. Knock them over as you're running and the clock will stop for a
[9987.99s -> 9993.11s]  short while. You win if you finish the course within the time limit. Okay. Three courses,
[9993.11s -> 10032.97s]  four ranks. I get it. I get it. I get it. Uh, straight course. I didn't even need to get the
[10032.97s -> 10041.91s]  other cone. A thousand zenny. Go to the left curve course. 15 seconds. Are you ready?
[10041.91s -> 10071.70s]  Okay. Yeah. Technical course. 25 seconds.
[10073.46s -> 10102.98s]  Fuck. Did I miss it? What? No, I didn't. Look at how tiny that is. I'm gonna lose. Oh, I did it.
[10102.98s -> 10125.14s]  No, I didn't. I'm gonna have to memorize this whole course. I didn't miss one, right?
[10133.66s -> 10148.23s]  Hey, what are you doing? Just walk. Okay. 3000. Now it's time to go back to the straight course.
[10149.34s -> 10154.34s]  10 seconds. I'm gonna do all. No, don't do them all in a row. I have to get them down.
[10161.42s -> 10173.51s]  Yes, it does. All right. This is a lot of money. Do it again. B, eight seconds. I have to get a
[10173.51s -> 10192.18s]  couple of the cones. Ooh, that was close. All right. Now I have to get all the cones. I gotta
[10192.18s -> 10200.15s]  get them all in one go. A, seven seconds. I gotta get both cones. Why don't I get them on the left
[10200.15s -> 10218.97s]  reliably? I think I'm live again. Oh, hi. Refresh. I'm sorry. I don't know what just happened. I think
[10218.97s -> 10226.02s]  we just dropped. Time for your appointment. No, no, no. We're fine. You'll know when it's
[10226.02s -> 10245.99s]  time for me to go. Whoa, that was close. Oh, I didn't get it. I didn't get it. This is the
[10245.99s -> 10269.62s]  second stream. Oh, yeah. He's live. He's live. He's live. This is not the second stream. Oh,
[10269.62s -> 10288.07s]  come on. I was trying to cut the corner. Got it perfect. Hold up. All right. I just did,
[10288.07s -> 10292.39s]  and I'm going left and right. I'm holding up as moving my character left and right.
[10293.11s -> 10300.52s]  That is a lie. Why did I even listen to that? For some reason I was like, maybe that's real.
[10316.60s -> 10324.94s]  Oh, how do I catch that? How am I supposed to catch this? I feel like I'm not even faster
[10324.94s -> 10344.01s]  to go through this straight. Damn, what? Holding should make you go faster. Yeah,
[10344.01s -> 10351.45s]  I have a D-pad. I was just doing. When I push up the character, he turns left and right.
[10352.17s -> 10378.14s]  Let me just, I need to take him. Let me see. Hold on a second. No, that doesn't do anything.
[10379.02s -> 10394.31s]  It actually doesn't do anything. Does holding down make me turn sharper? Let's find out.
[10395.29s -> 10412.68s]  Oh, not really. I mean, it should. If I do.
[10415.42s -> 10427.86s]  I just went slower. So why is up not working? I just cut the corner better.
[10429.74s -> 10463.70s]  We are Josh, the liar. What do I get? Music box. Please enter a name. Oh, okay. That's
[10463.70s -> 10487.24s]  I get it. I get it. Left curve. This is going to suck. Oh, come on. I got to get this done.
[10487.24s -> 10497.30s]  It's going to take me a little while. Nine seconds. So it's wrap around and then it's
[10497.30s -> 10507.00s]  bang bang. All right. Yeah. You got, you got to cut the corner a little higher
[10507.72s -> 10532.94s]  and then you have to go through here and then strafe. What's the A goal? Probably seven seconds.
[10533.58s -> 10560.79s]  Who cares? Duh. All right. I just did that. I did it in seven. I'm just eight. Let's do it again.
[10572.74s -> 10600.71s]  YouTuber. That was it. I do that shit when I do my laundry. I promise. What do I get? You win
[10600.71s -> 10618.79s]  Omni unit. Okay. Here we go. Technical course. This is going to be hard. It's going to be tighter
[10618.79s -> 10628.74s]  than that. Oh, it's going to be really tight. That one's going to be hard too. Oh, this one's
[10628.74s -> 10643.80s]  going to be fucking hard. I mean, we say this one is not what we do. I got, I got
[10654.04s -> 10669.11s]  really, really difficult and you got to get this one and now it's going to pull down to like 15
[10669.11s -> 10687.02s]  seconds to I'll give it a few more times and then I actually have to leave. That's so tight. I got
[10687.02s -> 10693.18s]  to hold. I don't even know what I have to hold down. I have to like actually cut that super hard.
[10701.08s -> 10728.52s]  All right. Last attempt. Yeah. I'm holding right and R1 when I turn so it's a tighter turn.
[10729.64s -> 10761.74s]  That's what I'm doing. All right. That's not bad. Oh, okay. So the end is really the problem now.
[10762.38s -> 10771.86s]  I might be a little, I might be all right. Try it again. It's that last
[10771.86s -> 10802.73s]  column that's going to be hard to hit. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Okay. What's A? 17 seconds. I can do this.
[10802.73s -> 10831.56s]  60. I can do this. Let's go. Oh, I fucked it up. It's okay. Sorry. I actually pushed in the left
[10831.56s -> 10882.87s]  stick. I screwed it up. Oh, fuck you. All right. Not you. This. Give it. I still get it. Oh, man.
[10882.87s -> 10887.43s]  Oh, if I had hit the cone, that would have been it. If I had hit that first cone, that would have
[10887.43s -> 10915.34s]  been it. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, you got to go like bang, bang. You got to like rip left,
[10915.34s -> 10939.46s]  rip right. That's the worst one. Nope. I kind of screwed it up. Sorry. I was late doc. I was
[10939.46s -> 10944.87s]  streaming Mega Man Legends. This is it. I'm going to complete this and I'm going to leave
[10945.43s -> 10958.60s]  and I'll come back later. Oh, that was almost perfect. I wish I could practice this
[10959.24s -> 10971.35s]  that part up here where you go like, no, as long as I leave here in about 15 minutes.
[10984.26s -> 11000.33s]  Damn it. Oh, fuck. It's so painful because if I hit it, I might hit the cone next to it too.
[11000.89s -> 11024.44s]  Really? This is your doctor. I believe you have an appointment with me in five minutes. All right.
[11024.44s -> 11031.37s]  Let's do it. Can we do it over the webcam? But I don't need to be there. Like, what's the
[11031.37s -> 11065.45s]  difference? It was a little sloppy near the end. At least I hit the cone. Nope. Already a failure.
[11065.45s -> 11092.54s]  If it is not pixel exact, you have to start over. All right. I'm actually doing spring more attempts
[11092.54s -> 11102.66s]  than I have to go to the doctor and I'll be back. I'll be back at like, probably like maybe six,
[11102.66s -> 11126.52s]  30 specific to finish. Oh, you mother fucker. Mother fucker. It was there. It was, that was the
[11126.52s -> 11154.58s]  one fucking frame. Perfect dog shit. All right. One more time. One more, one more, one more,
[11154.58s -> 11188.06s]  and I'll come back later. This one sucks. Oh, what? What was wrong with that? What was wrong
[11188.06s -> 11199.16s]  with that one? That was like perfect. What? Oh, is that not enough? It was right there.
[11199.56s -> 11237.94s]  No. Get out of here, John. Giant horn. What do these do? You're allowed to leave now. Yeah,
[11237.94s -> 11244.95s]  I'm allowed to leave. Tell the doctor. You should have seen it. I got 15.7 seconds
[11244.95s -> 11261.66s]  in the Mega Man Legends final tactical course. All right. Let me get out. Save the game. Okay.
[11261.66s -> 11270.92s]  So, uh, this is part one. I will see you guys. I'm not going to do the bits because technically
[11270.92s -> 11282.14s]  the stream's not over. It's just taking the pause. So, I will be back in a few hours and we'll
[11282.14s -> 11295.62s]  finish. But first, let me see what this is. Nothing. So, I will see you guys at around six, 30.
[11296.18s -> 11312.04s]  Let's say six, 30 Pacific. I'll be back. Don't be late to the doctor. I won't be. Don't worry.
[11312.04s -> 11327.14s]  Put up the BRB screen for three hours. No. No, that's so bad. No, I can't do that. No way.
[11330.38s -> 11338.71s]  No, that's weird. I don't like, I don't want a BRB screen up for three hours. That's so bad. No.
[11339.51s -> 11343.26s]  I don't think I even can do that. I think Twitch will turn the stream off.
[11343.98s -> 11348.54s]  I'm pretty sure like after like an hour or two, Twitch will turn, will turn me off.
[11349.50s -> 11364.28s]  I'm not sure I'm even allowed to do that. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's going to be too long.
[11364.28s -> 11368.20s]  It's going to be at least three hours from now. I'm not going to leave a BRB screen up.
[11369.91s -> 11380.36s]  No, I'm not doing that. You just need a timer that goes down. No, but what if I'm not back?
[11383.90s -> 11392.97s]  No, no. Goodbye. I'll see you guys in a couple hours. Goodbye. I'll be back. No, what if like,
[11392.97s -> 11398.09s]  what if I get stuck somewhere? What if I can't, what if there's a snowstorm and I can't leave
[11398.09s -> 11407.22s]  the doctor? All right. I'll see you guys in a couple hours. Part two incoming. How do I end
[11407.22s -> 11413.69s]  the stream? Just turn it off? Take it in a couple hours.
