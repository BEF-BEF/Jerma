[65.59s -> 77.56s]  Hello. I don't know what the emote is. What is it? Pepe face? Pepe laugh? Laughing face?
[78.20s -> 88.54s]  You know the one I'm talking about. Everybody knows about it. Do I have to explain what I mean
[88.54s -> 102.86s]  by Pepe face in the title? What is it called? I don't even have it activated. It's like Pepe
[102.86s -> 108.84s]  laugh or something. I don't know. The one where it's like Pepe the frog and his teeth are showing
[108.84s -> 121.35s]  like this and he's leaning back in his chair. Why is my mic quality so bad? Am I in the wrong mic?
[124.26s -> 132.04s]  No I'm not. Why is my mic quality so bad? I don't know.
[136.94s -> 144.57s]  I don't know. I think I have a nice mic. Who knows? It's not even been one minute
[146.74s -> 152.42s]  and Phylactery Lich just gave $50. 5000. But that didn't mean life at 30 seconds.
[155.06s -> 160.10s]  Watching your old videos reminds me of how old I am. Anyways, here's some casino money. Thank you.
[161.86s -> 170.55s]  Really appreciate that. Watching old videos of mine reminds me of how old I am too. Because
[170.55s -> 180.38s]  I get to watch myself degrade over time. I get a 10-year mirror. Don't you understand?
[183.64s -> 189.70s]  I can watch. Guys, I used to make a video like every other day. You know that thing? Oh,
[189.70s -> 197.37s]  take a picture of myself once every day for 10 years. I did that. I can go back and just see
[197.37s -> 210.74s]  me aging over a decade. You're aging like fine wine. Hey, thanks. I think I'm doing okay.
[212.36s -> 217.88s]  Oh, but anyways, let's talk about some stuff before we get started. I know, I always do.
[217.88s -> 223.64s]  All right, here we go. He's gonna talk about stuff. This one's important. Nobody say it.
[223.64s -> 229.96s]  Nobody say it because I didn't get a chance to tell anybody yet. Don't say it. Don't say it.
[232.55s -> 236.47s]  Ah, somebody said it. Ah, shit. What do I do now? Turn the stream off.
[238.42s -> 259.00s]  The carnival stream is set for September 21st, 2019. Of this year. Of this year. So I'm fucking
[259.00s -> 265.64s]  excited. A lot of work and a lot of time went into this. And I hadn't even gotten started.
[267.42s -> 274.57s]  I actually have to get on a plane next week and fly across the country to the facility
[274.57s -> 280.39s]  and go back and forth. We're gonna do a site visit. We're gonna walk around. We're gonna
[280.39s -> 295.42s]  talk about everything that's gonna happen. It is not Boston. No, somewhere else. It is somewhere
[295.42s -> 306.65s]  else in the United States of America. But the facility seems pretty great. The person that's
[306.65s -> 313.53s]  helping me and the team that's helping me work on that end of things. Area 51. No, it's not in
[313.53s -> 326.33s]  Nevada. It's in another state in the United States. No, it's not Florida. Wait, we don't have to guess
[326.33s -> 340.95s]  what state it is. You're gonna find out soon enough. He's going to Canada. No, but that's a
[340.95s -> 349.02s]  reality now. And a bunch of resources going into this. I can finally tell you that it's really
[349.02s -> 354.97s]  actually September 21st. There's like two teams involved with this. So it's not like, oh September
[354.97s -> 363.98s]  23rd, maybe maybe October. No, it's a contract. So I hope it's fun. You'll get more details as we go.
[371.00s -> 382.33s]  Let's hope it's I think it's gonna be fucking awesome. Get a lawyer. I am a lawyer. I just
[382.33s -> 388.57s]  looked. It's a big contract. It's like 25 pages long. And I just like skimmed it. And I was like,
[388.57s -> 400.36s]  yeah. And I flipped it over. I signed it. The best kind of lawyer there is one's one that skims
[400.36s -> 414.07s]  contracts. Click agree. Yeah. It's an it's the end user license agreement on anything you play
[414.07s -> 426.62s]  or do. I don't want to sound out of the loop here, but or sound mean. But why are you doing this?
[433.35s -> 445.46s]  I don't know. I because I because I want to. This is real. Do I have I don't really have a
[445.46s -> 452.68s]  reason for anything I do here. Mainly, I think it's because I think it'll be fun.
[454.07s -> 461.26s]  And I think the community over the years has been involved in so many things. And we've done so
[461.26s -> 470.73s]  many things that it's just it's fun to do shit. It's fun to make stuff. I don't really have a
[470.73s -> 489.88s]  reason. And they open it up at like win or lose. I don't care. I want to try. I want to try to do
[489.88s -> 503.18s]  something fun. I think that you guys know that over the years like that's something. Hey,
[503.18s -> 521.75s]  Super Mario Maker 2. Is it going to be a film crew? Yes. This is me playing by the way. Oops,
[521.75s -> 531.18s]  never mind. Now that was the computer. All right. So I'm going to play just random levels. What do
[531.18s -> 542.20s]  you guys know we can tell? All right. Give me fun levels. I don't want to do I and I know everybody
[542.44s -> 550.30s]  I know what people are writing over here. I don't want to do to start the stream. Central British
[550.30s -> 571.30s]  time. You understand? No. New notifications? No, I want to disable notifications. All right,
[571.30s -> 582.70s]  so let's go to courses and then new courses search. No, no, no. You go to ID, right?
[584.47s -> 592.30s]  That's not going to show if I like ID to everybody, right? No. Okay. What do we do? What
[592.30s -> 597.06s]  are we going to start with? Well, I like your lich. Thanks for the $50 and the five community
[597.06s -> 602.81s]  subs and core monster for the community subs too. All right. This person said I hate German,
[602.81s -> 630.34s]  so we're going to do that one. D6267 searching for course. Reach towards the end to get through the
[630.34s -> 643.34s]  portal. Find the hidden key for for what? How many people have tried this? 20%? That's not many.
[644.22s -> 657.62s]  All right. By the way, I'm doing strict vetoes this stream. If I don't if I'm not this is not
[657.62s -> 660.98s]  to say that anybody's levels are not good. I need to warm up first. I know I quit.
[661.86s -> 668.20s]  What was this one again? I don't know. I got a lot. I'm not ready. I haven't played in like two
[668.20s -> 673.88s]  weeks. Okay, no, I'm fine. I haven't played Mario in like two and a half weeks. Last time I played
[673.88s -> 684.14s]  was last time you saw me streaming. I'm not ready. I don't know the controls to Mario.
[685.10s -> 703.80s]  Do I have to find the hidden key? This is a trick. This is a trick. Well, it's too quiet. I don't
[703.80s -> 716.81s]  like how quiet this one is. It's silent. Oh no. No, you can't just run and jump. You have to like
[716.81s -> 736.12s]  walk turn 180. Jump. Twist. They added a twist. Oh, fuck. Wait, did the dog just? No, I can't. How
[736.12s -> 744.17s]  do I get over there? Why am I toad? I don't know. I didn't pick this. Did I pick this?
[745.88s -> 761.56s]  I did pick this, didn't I? I think it's gonna pick it up. Does that make the door up here?
[762.36s -> 781.14s]  Holy shit. What happened? It's a P door. Oh, okay. How do I get up there? Oh, I kind of like this one.
[784.62s -> 791.27s]  It's kind of scary, but it's fun. This is more of a walker than a runner.
[795.38s -> 809.42s]  Anything over here? What is that? I don't know. I don't know. I'm gone. Oh, that's a checkpoint.
[814.23s -> 823.19s]  Whoa. Whoa. By the way, this is going to be a not angry one. I know that if you're watching
[823.19s -> 827.59s]  these streams and you've watched me play Mario Maker like twice before, right now you're just
[827.59s -> 833.34s]  like, oh man, I can't wait to literally like start to say like mean things about video games. No,
[833.34s -> 836.54s]  I'm in too good of a mood. I got a locked in date of September 21st
[837.50s -> 841.66s]  for that carnival stream. Nothing can anger me today.
[845.59s -> 855.51s]  It's not going to make me. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm doing fine. I feel great.
[862.52s -> 869.50s]  Nothing's going to like bring me down. I should have seen that. I thought it was just spikes on
[869.50s -> 889.26s]  the wall. You're the best around. Thanks. Appreciate that. Now what? Ooh, I didn't even.
[900.04s -> 901.00s]  I have to read this.
[906.39s -> 913.51s]  Thank you door cube for the 250. We usually don't read bits like this early here, but they said,
[913.51s -> 919.59s]  how did you get the carnival stream off the ground this quick? But it's been years since you promised
[919.59s -> 929.08s]  a Noah's Ark toothbrush merch. Well, that's easy because it's impossible to find a company that's
[929.08s -> 935.58s]  going to manufacture custom toothbrushes for you. That doesn't exist. We're going to call Colgate.
[936.06s -> 947.37s]  Dear Colgate, can you make like 1200 toothbrushes for me? Or am I going to buy a bunch of blue
[947.37s -> 954.34s]  toothbrushes over a year from like CVS, the ones that have no brand on them, stockpile,
[954.34s -> 962.09s]  like 5,000 of them, and then just resell them. Isn't that as illegal? Isn't that against the law?
[963.27s -> 978.36s]  Oh shit. I'm dead. What? Oh, this is going to be hard. Hey, you're the lawyer here.
[978.68s -> 984.23s]  I skimmed it. I think that's like, no, no, no, you can. But isn't that like mean?
[987.62s -> 992.34s]  Let's say I buy a CVS blue toothbrush for a dollar and then I sell that CVS blue toothbrush
[992.34s -> 996.82s]  for $10. There's no like government agency that's going to get involved and go like,
[996.82s -> 1008.36s]  hey, these are a dollar. What happened? All right. I got to be ready for this.
[1009.40s -> 1013.77s]  Drop it. Oh shit. I'm dead. It's guaranteed to lose here. Guaranteed.
[1013.77s -> 1035.69s]  I got to stand up on the slow down. Don't go too fast. Oh my God. I went too fast.
[1036.73s -> 1044.73s]  All right. So I got to bait the first one and then jump over the second one or just jump from,
[1051.90s -> 1055.26s]  give these livid right now. Yeah. So I got to get this one to drop before it gets over here.
[1056.38s -> 1065.80s]  Same thing. Get it to drop, drop, drop, drop. Holy shit. Now what, now what do I do? Oh fuck.
[1065.80s -> 1076.71s]  Give me a checkpoint. Oh, I hate this. No checkpoint or anything. I don't, is it safe
[1076.71s -> 1091.50s]  to fall down here? I'm going to get trolled. This is going to be, oh, now go over here.
[1092.22s -> 1100.18s]  There's going to be something on the ceiling. I just know there is. This is going to be something
[1100.18s -> 1115.67s]  in that, in that thing's arm. Does not. Okay. I just needed to know. If I jumped into that,
[1115.67s -> 1123.56s]  it would have been horrible. Slow down. If I was a Mario maker level maker, I would put just
[1123.56s -> 1131.24s]  something to kill me right there. Just, just for me to walk into. I'm this far. I don't want to
[1131.24s -> 1153.42s]  blow it for a second. I thought I was making that music. All right. This is too deliberate to have
[1153.42s -> 1162.98s]  there not be something wrong here. Ah, I told you. I fucking told, what did I tell you? Look.
[1163.70s -> 1186.73s]  Oh shit. I probably shouldn't have done that. Where are they coming from? Where are they coming
[1186.73s -> 1206.18s]  from? Where are the football helmets coming from? Oops. Should I not have done that? Oh no. Okay.
[1206.26s -> 1216.01s]  Should I hit this one too? I feel like I should hit this one. I can get it. No, there's one right
[1216.01s -> 1223.69s]  here. Hit this one, I think. I don't know. I don't know. I don't like this one. This one's too,
[1224.41s -> 1228.09s]  it's, it's very deliberate and I like just running straight really fast.
[1229.90s -> 1247.59s]  Okay. Is that it? Don't blow it. That needs, oh, that needs a key. That needs a key to the key.
[1247.59s -> 1267.77s]  Where's the key? Oh, please respawn over here. Thank God. Wait, what? I did it. I did it. Okay.
[1273.03s -> 1283.13s]  Key to the true ending. I don't need, I don't get true endings. That was fun.
[1283.85s -> 1298.90s]  That was a little scary. Why? Wasn't it? All right, we'll grab this one. This level,
[1300.18s -> 1304.26s]  this level was made for fun and not to be mean to you. All right. Well, what is the over-under
[1304.26s -> 1312.62s]  that this is mean to me? I wonder. Hey, I promised this level was not made to be mean to you.
[1313.42s -> 1319.85s]  Why do I have to say that? Why can't you just, you know, hey, here's a level, man. Check it out.
[1327.59s -> 1335.82s]  Oh, maybe he doesn't know my face. All right. Four minutes. Fire Flower Skies one one.
[1339.19s -> 1346.95s]  Okay. Let's try it. It's going to be a German short spelled in blocks.
[1349.35s -> 1364.10s]  It's too hard. All right. Well, I got it. I got it. That's good. I got over the guy with the stereo.
[1368.79s -> 1382.92s]  Turn this way. Right. Got it. Bingo. Shit. Okay. Oh, I can get up there and get that 50.
[1383.56s -> 1399.27s]  I got to get two. Come on. They weren't lying. This is a fun one. You got, you're playing to my like
[1399.99s -> 1415.67s]  addicting shit that I do. Okay. No, it's not worth it. I might die if this goes down all the way.
[1415.67s -> 1419.11s]  I thought that was gonna just kill me. All right. Give me, I need to knock this guy out.
[1419.99s -> 1450.89s]  Ooh, how do I get the key? Uh-oh. Is it gonna be tough? Uh, what? Feels good when you get a nice
[1450.89s -> 1472.52s]  string. You can lay a nice volley back and forth. Well, can I bring one of you? It's all right.
[1472.52s -> 1484.68s]  Too much weight. That's not it, is it? Is there weight in Mario? That's definitely not weight.
[1488.66s -> 1496.18s]  Oh my god. You got me. You fucked me up with the whole weight comment. I'm trying to like jump
[1496.18s -> 1509.50s]  lighter because like maybe I weigh more. This, they don't have like weight classes in this. Toad
[1509.50s -> 1533.61s]  is like shorter and fatter. How did I get over there the first time? Toad has good acceleration
[1533.61s -> 1547.13s]  but bad turning? Is he a fucking car? What are you talking about? Wait, what? That's not real.
[1554.76s -> 1559.32s]  Yeah, Mario's got really good handling, but his brakes are always like kind of shitty.
[1559.32s -> 1574.89s]  All right, get me up there. He's automatic. I'm just gonna carry this. Get out. Okay. All right.
[1574.89s -> 1591.42s]  Excuse me. What happened there? Did he escape from my grasp? I have to go like this. No, I don't.
[1591.42s -> 1611.70s]  Okay. Um, uh-oh. Why did I do that? Do I have to go down? Okay, I gotta go down.
[1612.98s -> 1623.30s]  Holy shit. Okay, I got it. Give me that spring. I thought that was a hole.
[1626.28s -> 1635.80s]  I thought that was a hole. I thought that was a hole. I thought it was a hole. Like I'm explaining
[1635.80s -> 1652.06s]  the funny fucking, hold on. Oh, nothing has got that handling. Fuck. It's all right. I know how
[1652.06s -> 1672.22s]  to get down there. I almost missed it. You think everything is a hole. I have to think everything
[1672.22s -> 1678.28s]  is a hole. I'm playing Super Mario. Wait a minute. Is there a secret? Maybe I can jump up there?
[1679.40s -> 1686.07s]  Why am I, why am I storing them? This is bad. Why did I do that?
[1686.07s -> 1703.96s]  Uh-oh. My thumb got cold. Oh my god. Why is my thumb so cold? Okay, I might have to do like a few
[1703.96s -> 1720.86s]  push-ups. I'm not kidding. I guess I have blood in my hands. I'm telling you. I have to get blood
[1720.86s -> 1732.46s]  in my hand. I'm freezing. My hands are turning into ice. Oh, I'm gonna fall. Stop laughing.
[1736.54s -> 1745.66s]  Well, okay. I know that's there. Oh my god. No. My hands are freezing. They're turning like stone.
[1753.99s -> 1765.11s]  Every time I move my fingers like I hear like crack and my fans crack. This happens to me
[1765.11s -> 1772.20s]  sometimes. Does this happen to anybody else? I get like bad circulation in my hands. Oh my god. I'm
[1772.20s -> 1782.46s]  gonna fucking not get angry because today nothing's gonna make me angry today. Nothing's gonna make me
[1782.46s -> 1792.34s]  mad today. You know what today is? September 21st. Well today's not, that's not what today's
[1792.34s -> 1808.78s]  date is. Oh my goodness gracious. It's okay. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go put like my hands in the
[1808.78s -> 1829.78s]  microwave. Just for like two seconds. Oh, I gotta go get that stupid thing. All right, I'm good.
[1830.66s -> 1844.81s]  Let me just do this. All right, I just did a person microwave right here. That's a little
[1844.81s -> 1857.56s]  bit better. Turn down my AC. All right, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna even go that way. What's the
[1857.56s -> 1863.32s]  point? To get the secret true ending? We don't get true endings on this screen. A lot of you know
[1863.32s -> 1874.52s]  that by now. Hold on, this is interesting. I'm gonna, I guess I'm gonna go this way.
[1881.03s -> 1889.61s]  Ooh, all right, hold on. What's over here? You know, I only get bad endings? That's not true.
[1890.25s -> 1900.78s]  I'm gonna wait for another one. I even said it out loud. You heard me say it out loud. I said it out
[1900.78s -> 1907.02s]  fucking loud. I said it out loud. Slow down, Jeremy. I said it out loud. Why did I not do it?
[1907.98s -> 1931.91s]  I got impatient in three seconds. How is that possible? Oh god. Yeah, I know, right?
[1931.91s -> 1948.04s]  Don't worry, it's been salvaged. It's okay. I can dark souls them. Wait, that doesn't happen in
[1948.04s -> 1957.48s]  dark souls. That's all that was over here? What? That has to be more. Oh my god. I didn't know
[1957.48s -> 1971.70s]  that fire coming out of that shit. What do I do? Over to the right? I'm not stuck in here, am I?
[1987.48s -> 2002.71s]  No. What? There has to be a way. No, there has to be a way. There's got to be like a secret block or
[2002.71s -> 2021.37s]  there's got to be something hidden. Damn it. Oh, that was tricky too. Damn it. That was...
[2025.06s -> 2040.15s]  It's all right. I can... I know... This one's tricky. I'll tell you, this one... I wouldn't
[2040.15s -> 2049.98s]  put this one... This one's not hard. It's tricky. God damn it. Give me another one.
[2063.02s -> 2068.14s]  He's balding so hard. All right, you guys gotta tell me. Am I missing something on Twitch?
[2069.77s -> 2079.46s]  That's like a... Oh, he's like bald. He's like mad. You're not bald because you're mad. You're mad
[2079.46s -> 2084.34s]  because you're bald. Don't you understand? That's not... You guys got it in the reverse.
[2102.71s -> 2111.21s]  He's scalding. Easy. All right, the last... There's a hard jump over here. Once you get across,
[2112.01s -> 2138.34s]  you get to jump and then hit... Hold on. That would explain my internet rant? I don't do
[2138.34s -> 2144.17s]  internet rants. What? That's what I was talking about. That's the jump I was talking about.
[2144.81s -> 2162.10s]  I have to get it. What is it? Bang, bang, bang. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. I can't see from
[2162.10s -> 2173.90s]  here. Did I just almost get fucking hit by that thing? What do I do? Okay. Huh? I can't go
[2173.90s -> 2202.34s]  underneath this. I can't go this way. The way? I'm not gonna go down to the right. I don't...
[2204.44s -> 2207.32s]  He's faking it. What are you... Wait, wait, wait. What are you talking about?
[2208.89s -> 2220.86s]  How... The vine. What do you mean the vine? Oh shit. Okay. Watch out. Like I said, that guy's
[2220.86s -> 2229.05s]  good stuff. What does it throw at? Is it gonna hit me? No, it's not. Oh shit. This is gonna be
[2229.05s -> 2244.60s]  terrible. I gotta get up. Oh no. I have time. What's my time? No, this should be unlimited time in
[2244.60s -> 2270.73s]  Mario Maker. What happened? They hit the skybox? What happened? Oh, he... All right. I gotta go
[2270.73s -> 2276.49s]  quick. I can't just dick around. Let's go. I know where I need to go. Over to the right is just
[2276.57s -> 2302.44s]  getting baited. Go to acceleration. Bad balding. You're all gonna be fucking bald, all right?
[2302.44s -> 2308.84s]  I got news for all you young kids here. You're all gonna be bald. All of you. And it happens to
[2308.84s -> 2314.28s]  everybody. So you can just stare down that highway knowing that you're gonna drive down that road
[2314.28s -> 2322.12s]  eventually. You're all gonna be bald. All of you. Do you hear my voice? I've been talking a lot
[2322.12s -> 2331.05s]  recently. I've got a lot of... I can't, man. All right. Ravraw just gave 10 community subs. Thank you.
[2332.58s -> 2344.84s]  Thanks for the 10 subs. That really was an old man yell. I need to like work on that.
[2346.12s -> 2357.80s]  You're all gonna be bald. I can't wait like 30 years from now. How old am I gonna be? Like 75?
[2358.52s -> 2374.76s]  I'm gonna be like 96. Lying in my deathbed. And like Twitch 2 will be out by then. And fucking
[2378.26s -> 2386.25s]  super DX, Degeneration X 49222. You're gonna be streaming right there. You in the chat.
[2387.21s -> 2392.41s]  Gotta set bald like 10 times. I'm gonna be watching your channel while you're spreading
[2392.41s -> 2396.65s]  fingers through your hair. Going, I don't understand. Like I'm... This wasn't like this
[2396.65s -> 2403.13s]  like a few years ago. And people get in the chat gonna be like, haha bald! Bald! And I'm gonna be
[2403.13s -> 2426.73s]  lying on my bed just going like... You fucker. I told you. At least I'll get to see it. I'll at
[2426.73s -> 2439.80s]  least get to see it. Finally, I can die in peace. One of my Twitch chatters is bald now.
[2442.89s -> 2446.49s]  What about the... Grandpa, what about your will? You didn't sign that yet.
[2487.53s -> 2497.10s]  Make sure you skim the will first. I'm not gonna hold on to this thing for that one.
[2498.50s -> 2504.26s]  Why do I hold on to these guys? What did I just... I just like set that guy up to kill me later.
[2508.39s -> 2521.06s]  What was over here? Oh shit. I don't know. I'm going this way. Ooh, fire. Wait, can Toad do fire
[2521.06s -> 2529.34s]  in canon? He's not like worthy to eat the fire flower, right? Only like Mario and Luigi can eat
[2529.34s -> 2546.97s]  these. It's like the hammer. All right, I gotta get down here. I'm not sure what that did. Do I
[2546.97s -> 2552.95s]  actually have to carry that all the way over here? Uh oh, I think I do. Don't do that to me.
[2552.95s -> 2578.09s]  I gotta jump. Jump off the... Oh god. No, come on. No. No. Come here.
[2580.62s -> 2585.51s]  Do you remember the door? I'm okay. I'm fine. What do you mean the door? No, I don't have the key.
[2586.47s -> 2590.68s]  I don't have the key. I don't have the key. Pause it. I don't have the key. What are you talking
[2590.68s -> 2628.81s]  about? Low door. Go right. The bottom... What? Oh god. Key! Uh oh. I have 38 seconds to get down
[2628.81s -> 2656.87s]  this. It's a fucking maze. What is that? I freaked out. It's all right. I'm starting right here.
[2656.87s -> 2674.42s]  Oh, thank god. Got the checkpoint. That's all that matters. Oh, the top has spikes too.
[2686.02s -> 2696.02s]  Huh? Is Bowser here somewhere? What do I need to break? Blocks? I'm confused. Up? Around?
[2703.21s -> 2706.25s]  When I just see the Bowser face take over your screen, that means that he's here.
[2706.81s -> 2732.44s]  Isn't that what that means? Ah, what? Come on. I hit that. Don't blow up on me. No.
[2733.88s -> 2750.86s]  Welp, the ice. Does this work? Oh, it does. Okay. All right. I thought I... All right. I'm fine.
[2751.50s -> 2761.42s]  I should make a kai emote. Yeah, I just think I'm making a kai emote.
[2767.88s -> 2787.99s]  Just... All right. Spit it out. What does that do for me if I do that? What does this do?
[2789.51s -> 2813.42s]  Okay, easy. It's slippery. Just drop down? Where does this go? Oh, that was the top, right?
[2814.62s -> 2829.67s]  So I can walk around it. I get it. This is a good one. I like this one. This is a good one.
[2830.39s -> 2858.71s]  Who made this? I did. So now I can go underneath, right? Um, get out of here. Hold on. Wait.
[2859.51s -> 2866.71s]  How do I get out from under this? Oh, no. I'm just like those two. They must have done the same thing.
[2875.03s -> 2882.42s]  You know, I'm so focused on... Can I just jump over the top of this? All right. How do I die?
[2882.98s -> 2901.91s]  How do I die? Bombs can break the wooden blocks. Oh, God. Give me a break. Um,
[2902.79s -> 2906.47s]  what do you guys want to do for 200 seconds? Because I'm not starting over.
[2907.43s -> 2932.97s]  Wait, hold on. How do I die? Is this... Is this synced up? Let's do a test. Ready?
[2935.29s -> 2947.83s]  How about this? Ready? Like, you should be hearing like... Is that synced?
[2948.39s -> 2972.92s]  Is it? Okay, good. Let's see if I can do like a beat. It's too hard to do with these buttons.
[2973.56s -> 3005.80s]  Faster. I wonder how fast I can do it. This is what it's like to be in like jail here.
[3007.64s -> 3011.08s]  Just comb my hair for a little bit. I can't hit star button. I'm sorry.
[3012.04s -> 3025.51s]  Just die. I can't die. If I die, I start at the beginning. Erasable pen erasers to do fast on the
[3025.51s -> 3029.88s]  buttons. I've never heard of that technique. You can restart it without losing progress.
[3030.76s -> 3078.10s]  Are you serious? No, I can't. No, I definitely can't. Come on! Hurry up! Tell a joke. What do
[3078.10s -> 3084.89s]  you want me to say? What joke do I have right now? Besides, I can't leave the level and I can't die.
[3085.69s -> 3101.21s]  What am I supposed to say? All right. I'm an observational comedyist, so
[3102.01s -> 3114.26s]  let me... We got two turnip people, right? The ice underneath us. I'm stuck in between here.
[3115.06s -> 3124.44s]  What's an observation that I can say about this? There's nothing. There's nothing to say. I'm just
[3124.44s -> 3133.38s]  inside of the... I'm soft-locked in the game. I have nothing to say. I got it right at zero.
[3133.38s -> 3144.15s]  We're hemorrhaging viewers. That's all right. They'll be back right now. Ready?
[3144.15s -> 3154.78s]  Once I beat this first try. Three, two, one, go. I told you they'll... Look, they're back already.
[3155.34s -> 3194.14s]  They're already here. Come on, blow up. Oh, nice. Anything up here? How do I get up there?
[3194.14s -> 3199.46s]  Okay, I'm good. See, they're back. Look, we just went up by like eight viewers. Those eight people
[3199.46s -> 3234.06s]  came back. Checkpoint. Yes, we're good. That's what you got to do. Oops. Oops.
[3237.51s -> 3243.29s]  Watch out. Okay, we're good. This is a long one, but this one doesn't feel long. It feels
[3243.29s -> 3250.94s]  like it was very well thought of. And what am I supposed to do about this? Will they go up if I
[3250.94s -> 3269.08s]  jump? Uh, kind of. Oh, right. I forgot this is Super Mario. He doesn't know. He doesn't even know.
[3269.80s -> 3289.00s]  Oh my god, he doesn't know. Yes, I do. I know everything. Do the Peter Griffin laugh. Why on
[3289.00s -> 3317.40s]  earth would I do that right now? There it is. I'm not gonna do the Peter Griffin laugh. That was
[3317.40s -> 3332.39s]  good. Good level. One percent completion rate. Is that me doing all those attempts? No, it's not.
[3337.42s -> 3348.54s]  Need the Peter. I can't even do a Peter Griffin laugh. Pick this one. Pick this one. This one.
[3348.54s -> 3379.66s]  This one. This one. Try my level. You got it. Do this one. M0430R9TH. Did I do that wrong?
[3379.66s -> 3402.73s]  Was it an O instead of a zero? What just happened? That was a fucking prank level? Are you serious?
[3403.69s -> 3414.81s]  I don't even. Why? What? How would that be a prank level that says like
[3418.94s -> 3433.58s]  moth? I don't understand. Oh my god, please. Why? All right, I'm doing this one. All right,
[3433.58s -> 3445.59s]  set me real shit by the way. I don't want to like put in your fucking joke code. No joke codes. Is
[3445.59s -> 3457.61s]  this a joke code? No, it's not. Wide to pinwheel. A lot of swinging. Also watch your jumps. Good luck.
[3460.76s -> 3469.30s]  All right, let's do it. I mean, it's not a joke code, but it might be a joke level.
[3469.94s -> 3493.35s]  It's an auto scroller too. Oh, it's pinwheels. I get it. Oh, the top. I didn't even pay attention
[3493.35s -> 3503.91s]  to the top. Sorry. Oh, I didn't. How did I not? What's going on? What is going on with my fucking
[3503.91s -> 3510.63s]  hands? Why did I? I'm trying to jump off the damn thing. That's gonna make me angry today.
[3511.27s -> 3529.99s]  Boost through the whole thing. I'm just gonna damage boost through the whole thing next time too.
[3530.79s -> 3557.48s]  Don't go too high. Oh no. How am I gonna? All right, yeah, damage frames. Let's go. You get a
[3557.48s -> 3575.70s]  mushroom over there anyways. Not fast enough. Not fast enough apparently. Hey, by the way,
[3575.70s -> 3592.34s]  did I tell you? September 21st. Put the date on your calendar. Why? What? Is it like a sinking issue
[3592.34s -> 3613.82s]  here with the wireless controller here? I don't get it. All right, just go.
[3620.65s -> 3627.29s]  We talked about this last time on the last Mario Mega stream, but the easiest way to make any
[3627.29s -> 3635.13s]  streamer really, really upset and mad and annoyed is telling them that when they're losing,
[3636.09s -> 3642.41s]  like, stop pretending. It's like, even though I know you're fucking around, like, it's like,
[3642.41s -> 3647.53s]  I'm not pretending. It's like, oh, he has to be pretending. He can't be this stupid.
[3650.04s -> 3658.36s]  That's like, every, I don't care who they are. Every single streamer on Twitch, when they see
[3658.36s -> 3665.86s]  though that phrase, what is he pretending again, is like, hey, I'm not pretending. It doesn't matter
[3665.86s -> 3682.86s]  if it's fake. Let's go this way. No, that's just a coin over there, right? That was not worth it
[3682.86s -> 3694.17s]  because how am I going to get back? Just go up? I don't know if I can do that from here.
[3694.89s -> 3710.90s]  Going across? Oh, man. Okay, that's pretty cool. All right, I did, I don't know why I thought that
[3710.90s -> 3742.39s]  was going to stop. Points. Okay, so I know where to go from here. Now, can I even do this?
[3742.71s -> 3752.01s]  While being big? It's harder. Can I have somebody in the chat explain to me why that didn't catch
[3752.01s -> 3763.62s]  twice? I didn't do anything. Why didn't I, why did I not catch? Because I was invincible?
[3764.34s -> 3772.15s]  No, I clearly was in there. Can you not get grabbed when you're invincible?
[3783.96s -> 3789.91s]  All right, that's all right. I want to be small anyways. What was that? I had no momentum.
[3801.48s -> 3802.44s]  I do like this one, though.
[3808.30s -> 3819.99s]  We're good. All right, so it's gonna be tough to actually jump over this.
[3821.03s -> 3834.58s]  I got it. Okay. And then up and then over. And then from here. Oh, too tall. Watch it. Okay,
[3834.58s -> 3856.06s]  this is this part. Fire down there. I think I have to run across this. I need a running start.
[3856.86s -> 3873.48s]  I did it. Cool. Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, it is the auto scroll portion.
[3874.62s -> 3889.10s]  Uh, all right. I'm gonna go, uh, I'm gonna go right. Left side. I like how there's two different
[3889.10s -> 3913.72s]  ways to go. Oh, come on. I don't know where I am. I really probably needed that. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[3913.72s -> 3923.67s]  Thank god I got it correct. And then up. Let's see. It's up and then right. What about this one?
[3929.26s -> 3937.96s]  Ooh, easy. Which way? Which way do I need to be? I don't know. I have to take a guess. Uh,
[3937.96s -> 3953.74s]  I went right last time. We're gonna go left. Got it right. I don't care about the coins.
[3954.30s -> 3982.78s]  Okay, stop. Ah! Okay, I'm fine. Can I? Are those platforms? Are they? Hold on. Oh, no. Not
[3982.78s -> 3988.14s]  another one of these. Another one of these. Where is it going? Oh, fuck. Okay, hold on.
[3988.78s -> 3997.78s]  I just panicked. Ah! Um, up. Is there another one firing on anywhere? Where's the other one?
[3998.34s -> 4011.46s]  There's one right here! Which way? Um, is there anything up? Still? Nope. Go. Oh, please. Okay.
[4013.48s -> 4019.40s]  What? No. Oh, god. No. I have to jump this. Let me take a look at what it looks like.
[4020.20s -> 4023.80s]  It's just... I need to jump from where that coin is. That's definitely what it means.
[4024.36s -> 4040.14s]  Run? Jump at this platform across. Hold your breath. Oh! Okay. And then... Shit. I think I need
[4040.14s -> 4048.58s]  to momentum here. I need to do a jump-jump, don't I? I'm not gonna make that. I need to be going as
[4048.58s -> 4061.10s]  fast with that first jump. Shit. Okay. Ah! Up? I think I'm gonna go up. Watch out for the saw.
[4061.82s -> 4067.94s]  Oh, god. Come on. No, there's only, like, a coin up here. I don't want to go up here anymore.
[4067.94s -> 4075.37s]  I don't want to go up here anymore. No. I don't want to do this hard jump. I need to... I'm dead.
[4079.38s -> 4087.30s]  I think it's peak of that jump. Holy shit! I'm okay. And then, but how do I get over this one?
[4087.30s -> 4096.39s]  I'm gonna hit it, aren't I? Ah! Does this move? Does this move? Does anyone know if that moves?
[4098.84s -> 4108.86s]  Is this gonna come up? I'm terrified. Did they come up? I did it. Game over. That was fun.
[4109.50s -> 4128.94s]  Can I breathe now? Yes, you can. Let's give that one eye. Nice job. He stopped pretending.
[4129.66s -> 4154.38s]  Sometimes you gotta pretend. What an actor. Uh, you won't pick this one. Um, yes, I will. Uh-oh,
[4154.38s -> 4164.20s]  people are starting to understand how to game my brain. You have to just put a sad face.
[4168.58s -> 4172.50s]  I have the last two or three that I've done have been, you're not gonna play mine with a sad face,
[4172.50s -> 4178.68s]  and I'm like, yeah, I will. Of course I will. Here you go, man. Uh, this is called Monty Symbiosis.
[4179.24s -> 4182.44s]  Monty Balls have teamed up with Piranha Plants. Show evolution whose boss it is.
[4183.32s -> 4203.00s]  You can do this apparently in a minute. Okay. This is a hard one. This is World 1-1.
[4207.61s -> 4219.77s]  Oh, all right. Is there a mushroom? Is that gonna hurt me? Well, that's an easy 10 point.
[4220.97s -> 4225.69s]  What's in here? All right. Oh, just getting all the secrets in this one.
[4226.49s -> 4238.82s]  I'm not gonna admin me. No. Oh, shit. You just, I can't be on the ground. Oh, this is gonna be
[4238.82s -> 4265.50s]  terrible. Okay. Watch out for those hidden blocks. Don't touch the ground. That's the name of the
[4265.50s -> 4275.26s]  game. I can touch the ground for a second. Okay. I know this one right here now, so that's good.
[4276.14s -> 4286.92s]  I don't have to sit there and freak out about mushrooms. That hitbox was dog shit, I will tell
[4286.92s -> 4311.62s]  you. Up. I feel like I want to get in there. No. Fireballs? Oh, God. Okay. They come out.
[4311.62s -> 4318.06s]  Give me that, please. Uh, wait. Come back. Come back, come back, come back, come back, come back.
[4319.26s -> 4327.34s]  Come, and I'll be back eventually. Don't worry. I've, no, no, no. Connect that because I,
[4327.34s -> 4330.06s]  that needs to come back. I need, I want to, whatever this is I want it. It's not coming
[4330.06s -> 4353.46s]  back, is it? Yeah, I can die faster than it will come back. Should I go up? Why would that vine be
[4353.46s -> 4368.70s]  there? I thought it was going to go up somewhere. All right, now switch it. Watch out for the fire.
[4370.52s -> 4391.54s]  Do they all have fire? Is that going to, just don't move. Uh oh, uh oh. Don't move. What? I,
[4392.18s -> 4404.46s]  damage boost ruined the whole thing. I don't know why I wanted to do that so bad, but I had to.
[4405.02s -> 4423.43s]  That was a good one. I didn't see them. They blended the fuck in real good. I was not paying
[4423.43s -> 4429.43s]  attention to that. He's not, I, whatever. I'm telling you right now, that was legitimate.
[4431.46s -> 4452.54s]  I thought they were grass. I thought they were grass. I have to jump. No, it's going to hit me.
[4452.54s -> 4465.32s]  It's going to double tap me. Stop. Oh, all right, I'm fine. Jump over the grass. Wait, I could,
[4465.32s -> 4484.20s]  there probably was a block. No true endings. Only bad endings here, guys. That was a fun one. Nice.
[4485.16s -> 4493.91s]  Good level. You are going to play this one. Yes, I am. Yes, I will play this one. Make sure it's
[4493.91s -> 4519.83s]  not like a poopy to poo. Maneuvering Bob-ombs. This is new. No one's played this one in the world,
[4519.83s -> 4524.74s]  probably besides me. It's a puzzle level, so I'm going to have a lot of fun with this one.
[4525.30s -> 4530.78s]  For a second, I thought my intro was still playing in the background. I was like,
[4530.78s -> 4544.07s]  how the hell did nobody tell me this yet? All right, obviously the bomb to explode this guy.
[4544.87s -> 4552.20s]  Now we need the bomb to hit the switch. Yep, okay, and we have to have you come down. Take
[4552.20s -> 4562.78s]  the bomb with us over here. All right, there's more bombs. So we got to do, put the bomb up there,
[4563.58s -> 4571.32s]  and it's got to hit it. Hit the switch. That was a little too early. Might still do it. No. Oh,
[4571.40s -> 4578.12s]  yeah. Hold on. One, two, three, four, five. Okay, it's been five seconds. How long? One,
[4578.92s -> 4586.58s]  two. So in three seconds, I have to get it over there. So we go one, two, three, one.
[4587.30s -> 4618.84s]  Law. Come on. Stop, stop, stop. One, two, three, two, two, three, one, two. What?
[4622.01s -> 4654.97s]  Put it on. No. Did I use them all? He's baiting help donations. I don't have like text to speech
[4654.97s -> 4659.37s]  on. If anything, like a help donation would be worse because I have to look over here.
[4660.17s -> 4672.87s]  And now what? Wait, wait, wait. What do I have to? You motherfucker. I didn't think two more than
[4672.87s -> 4682.07s]  two could be out at one time. I thought like only two could be out at one time. I remember because
[4682.07s -> 4698.54s]  it was... That's going to hit me. It's going to hit me still. Get up there. Hurry. I like this one.
[4699.99s -> 4711.21s]  What are you thinking? Pretending to be like mad for donations. I don't get it. I don't understand.
[4711.21s -> 4724.17s]  What are you talking about? Somebody donate and like tell me. I don't get it. I'm so stupid.
[4728.31s -> 4735.02s]  Talking about donations is baiting donations. Don't you know, even if you say the word donation,
[4738.14s -> 4755.10s]  but I need to have like banned words as a streamer. Donation prime. Why did I do that?
[4755.10s -> 4771.46s]  No, no, it's going to kill it. It's a key. See what I'm talking about? I can't say those words.
[4771.46s -> 4778.62s]  I cannot say the word prime. I can't say it because Herbert just gave 25 subs. Holy shit.
[4778.62s -> 4787.99s]  You see what I'm saying? That's a lot of subs. Thank you, Herbert. That's fucking too many.
[4789.22s -> 4792.66s]  And then LaCrona just gave $65. Do you understand? I need to have like...
[4794.26s -> 4801.30s]  I can't say the word money on stream. LaCrona, thanks with 65 bucks and Herbert for the 25 subs.
[4801.30s -> 4809.29s]  Greedy streamer sucks money out of wallet of innocent streamer. Okay, I'm never going to say
[4809.29s -> 4815.93s]  the word money again on stream. Anytime I want, I'm going to talk about like capital or
[4819.37s -> 4826.81s]  paper trading goods. That's what I'm going to say. Monthly paper trading goods subscription.
[4826.81s -> 4835.05s]  All right, so I need to stop that from coming down, but it kills it.
[4835.05s -> 4844.84s]  It's got to be there long enough for it to explode. All right, so hold on. Ready?
[4844.84s -> 4859.61s]  Go. No, what? Why does it not stay on top of it? It can't. Ban the word pretending.
[4860.33s -> 4869.58s]  That's not reaching it. It looks like it's reaching it.
[4878.63s -> 4889.40s]  Fuck. I'm not acting. Yes, I am. I'm a fucking actor. This is a puzzle one. You're not supposed
[4889.40s -> 4907.05s]  to beat this one quick. How long does this travel over there? You have to go like...
[4908.09s -> 4925.98s]  No, no, way earlier than that. Jesus. Now what? Oh, that hurts. Oh, you got to crane this. Come
[4925.98s -> 4930.76s]  on over here. Drop it. Holy shit, this is going to be horrible. All right, stay over here.
[4937.98s -> 4945.40s]  Can I just throw it in? There's too many of them. This whole thing is going to get
[4945.40s -> 4951.16s]  messed up here. I can't go over here. I can no longer jump over here. What do I do? What do I
[4951.16s -> 4968.44s]  do about this? There's too many. Okay, shit. How many do you think I can have over here?
[4968.44s -> 4973.58s]  I'm not playing that game right now. I'm playing the try to win. I don't like it to come out so
[4973.58s -> 4986.02s]  fast. All right, this next one I'm going to try. Come here. Ready? I should get it now.
[4989.64s -> 4996.26s]  Get it. Drop it over here quick. Oh, come on. That was the one. You got to get it when it's on
[4996.26s -> 5017.32s]  its way this way. Get it. Oh, like how far is it? How far does it go? Easy. No.
[5019.48s -> 5041.43s]  Please. Okay. Grab one. No. YouTuber scream. That was a gasping for air. I didn't scream.
[5042.07s -> 5069.10s]  Oh my God, please. All right. Wait. Grab it. Drop it. Please mom.
[5070.06s -> 5085.32s]  I have to like put it pushed down. What am I supposed to do?
[5087.88s -> 5129.80s]  Put that helmet on. Can I pick it up? I can't pick it up. Do I have to bounce it with my head?
[5143.08s -> 5150.76s]  Okay. Well, I don't even know that. Okay. This is like the second time I've played Mario Maker
[5150.76s -> 5155.59s]  in like three weeks. I don't know you could do this shit. I thought I was just going to go
[5156.39s -> 5177.66s]  and explode. Oops. Fuck. It's actually kind of hard. Oh no. Give me another one.
[5182.70s -> 5196.58s]  You said you knew everything. Nobody can know everything. I'm facing the right side.
[5196.58s -> 5234.95s]  I'm facing to the right. Do we die already? More than three. Interesting. Four? More than five times?
[5234.95s -> 5258.66s]  It's not going to be eight. God. Fuck me. Why? No. Don't. Please. I don't want to do this again.
[5259.46s -> 5281.40s]  I really, I don't want to do this again. Oh fuck. Die. Guys. What's going on here?
[5282.36s -> 5311.37s]  Does this end? Give that to me. Oh my God. This thing's gonna explode. That was a scream.
[5311.37s -> 5315.53s]  That was a scream. Yes. You can say I screamed because I did. That was an actual scream.
[5316.01s -> 5331.35s]  Get me out of here. Excuse me. I really don't want to do that eight more times. So I hope I don't die.
[5332.15s -> 5346.70s]  Hey, I'm like five for five right now. That's pretty. I've beaten every level that it's come
[5346.70s -> 5362.54s]  across. I haven't vetoed any yet. Uh, 50 more dollars came in from another fan. Three, two, one.
[5362.54s -> 5370.18s]  Thank you for the 50 dollars. I'm a dirty YouTube archive watcher. I'm still catching up on your
[5370.18s -> 5374.42s]  stuff since you stream so often, but it's my dream for you to play one of my levels.
[5374.42s -> 5394.90s]  And they put their level here. Nobody in chat beat this. Bribery. Well, thank you for the 50
[5394.90s -> 5398.98s]  dollars. And I'm going to play your level. I am. I just, what, what do you want me to say?
[5400.07s -> 5410.46s]  Guys, give me a break. That was fun. You got bribed and sweet talk. It's really not that hard to
[5410.46s -> 5416.58s]  make me do something. Well, I mean, that's, that's a lot of money. That's, that is hard.
[5416.58s -> 5420.47s]  That's a ton of fucking money. You don't have to pay me money to play your level, but like,
[5421.03s -> 5453.90s]  I just saw it. Don't worry. We're going to be here for a while. Don't worry. Bound across
[5453.90s -> 5461.54s]  bumpers. Bounce across the desert. Jump right as soon as you land to get extra height. 28 seconds.
[5461.54s -> 5488.22s]  Short and sweet. All right. Less than 20 seconds. It's the bumpers. I have a reasonable explanation
[5488.22s -> 5493.18s]  as to how that happened. I started to burp. I like, I could feel a burp coming out of my stomach
[5493.18s -> 5497.42s]  and I stopped for a second and just, that's a very reasonable explanation.
[5497.98s -> 5509.91s]  Not enough. I'm not pretending. That looked very much like somebody was pretending, but they
[5509.91s -> 5515.67s]  weren't. I promise. That looked like it could have, it looked like I just walked into the hole. Like,
[5515.67s -> 5520.23s]  oh shit, I, I fell down, but I missed going through the hole. But let me just like nudge
[5520.23s -> 5525.05s]  to the left a little. I fell down. But I can assure you, that's not what happened.
[5525.93s -> 5532.44s]  How do I get in there? Well, that's how. I like this one. This one's nice and like,
[5532.68s -> 5557.54s]  cool. Mario three. The best Mario that nobody plays. And what I mean by that is most people
[5557.54s -> 5561.62s]  that play Mario three play the first two or three levels and then skip to the end of the game
[5562.58s -> 5592.54s]  every time. Oops. It's a great game though. Bounce. Oh my God. What the fuck am I doing?
[5592.54s -> 5600.33s]  It's different Mario. It's a different style. That's why I've been, I've been playing. What
[5600.33s -> 5605.30s]  was I on before? I was playing a different Mario before. It's a different style and there's
[5605.30s -> 5638.25s]  different weight. Oh shit. That's a far away. Oh no. Am I in trouble? Why am I commentating
[5638.25s -> 5647.10s]  over a 10 year old's gameplay of Mario? It would be an easy string, you know. It's gonna be easy.
[5660.17s -> 5664.33s]  Somebody can do that in 28 seconds. Well, that was, that was fun. That was a fun,
[5664.33s -> 5668.17s]  just little level. It was fun to play. Thank you for that level. That was another fan.
[5668.97s -> 5678.10s]  All right. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. This is says, this one says
[5678.10s -> 5685.93s]  easy fun hand warmer. I don't know what that means. Oh, right. It was my hands. And then
[5687.53s -> 5717.83s]  we'll do slime. We'll do your level right after zero. All right. Mechanism mine. Go through mine
[5717.83s -> 5726.23s]  with a fair amount of traps. Puzzle solving standard length. How much money do I have to
[5726.23s -> 5730.87s]  pay you to play my level? There is no amount of money that I will take to play level. I just do,
[5730.87s -> 5734.63s]  I just do it if it's, if I see it, there's no, you don't have to pay me to play level.
[5735.27s -> 5739.83s]  This is the worst Mario ever. This is the worst one. So I already don't like this one because it's
[5739.83s -> 5759.58s]  the one that has this. This is literally the best Mario. I'm just kidding guys. My God.
[5759.58s -> 5765.74s]  I don't need to make a Dark Souls, Souls born tier list of Mario games. Although might as well.
[5768.34s -> 5788.46s]  Oh, they're all pretty fun. All the Mario games are fun. They've fun games. They've lasted
[5788.46s -> 5796.97s]  like 60 years. I can't really think of another product that's been around for that long
[5797.77s -> 5831.18s]  that people still like. Cars. Yeah. Okay. So a car has lasted. That's fine. Yes. Oh God. What do
[5831.18s -> 5844.33s]  I do with this? The TV. The TV has, has the TV been around for 60 years so far? Kind, sort of. Not
[5844.33s -> 5869.37s]  really though. Hold on. Like what are the, let's go ahead and do this again. Oh, why have you done
[5869.37s -> 5893.75s]  that? Just damn thing. Um, what do I do now? What? Oh, I guess I'm just gonna go, go up.
[5895.19s -> 5904.89s]  The TV is so good. Why don't we have TV too? I mean, you're on TV too right now. Can I?
[5905.85s -> 5949.72s]  Oh shit. This one's pretty cool. Uh, but how does, what? Key block? That was, that won't,
[5951.00s -> 5967.50s]  what's going on here? There's no key block. Thought I had it. What the fuck is happening?
[5973.72s -> 5991.40s]  What? Did I mess it all up back here? Am I missing something? No, I,
[5991.40s -> 6013.30s]  that's up here. Is there a key block available? It has to grab that. Okay.
[6014.50s -> 6028.68s]  I don't, I think I screwed it all up though, didn't I? I think I blew it. I blew it.
[6043.88s -> 6047.72s]  I'm telling you, I swear to God, people think I'm making this shit up,
[6047.72s -> 6051.88s]  but sometimes when you press a button on the switch controller, it just like doesn't
[6051.88s -> 6075.50s]  happen. It's like a phantom button press. I promise. I'll get it this time.
[6077.02s -> 6094.07s]  I, you know, I'm already back down here. It's like it never happened. Oops. Can't do that.
[6097.13s -> 6107.98s]  That's, I don't get that. I don't get it. I'm going to not, I won't lie. I don't, I don't,
[6108.06s -> 6133.50s]  I don't get it. I don't get that one to clean. Okay. Now I need to, don't get that. Does that
[6133.50s -> 6140.22s]  despawn? All right. So we've got a scenario where I've got to press the button up there.
[6140.22s -> 6163.99s]  Go get this pullback. No, no, no. Oh my God. I still got it. No more screaming. I promise.
[6163.99s -> 6190.50s]  What the fuck do I get back up there? No, I have to go all the way up to get the helmet.
[6201.16s -> 6204.84s]  I, I'm freaking out. I don't, I don't get it. I'm fucked up. I don't understand. I'm
[6204.84s -> 6216.47s]  fucking freaking out. Well, I don't know. I just get up here. I, do I not even need the helmet?
[6228.28s -> 6233.99s]  I don't think I even need to use the P switch for here. I think I just have to follow it up.
[6234.79s -> 6253.06s]  So just take it and then like, can I just get up there? Okay. So this is why I was freaking
[6253.06s -> 6259.62s]  out because I don't, I guess I never even needed in the first place. Okay. Let's go.
[6261.62s -> 6272.07s]  I need to bring it all the way over there. No, stop picking. Oh my God. I'm going to freak the
[6272.07s -> 6281.69s]  fuck out. I need to bring it up all the way. I had to bring it up the whole way, not just right
[6281.69s -> 6288.68s]  there. I got to bring up the entire way. How am I going to do that now? How did you get down here?
[6300.94s -> 6305.26s]  I, I thought that when it came over here, I could press it. I didn't have to go all the way up.
[6305.26s -> 6320.50s]  Okay. So now, wait, what the fuck has happened? What, what does this matter?
[6320.50s -> 6337.42s]  Do I just do it now? I think do it now, right? Go all the way up. Isn't that going to fuck this up?
[6356.41s -> 6376.25s]  Huh? What the fuck? I didn't know something came out of there. I didn't know something came out of
[6376.25s -> 6382.30s]  that fucking thing. How was I supposed to know that? I didn't know that a thing came out. That's
[6382.30s -> 6386.70s]  why I spent this much time trying to figure out what the hell to do. I didn't know that someone's
[6386.70s -> 6393.24s]  going to jump out of there. You can't dock points on my intelligence because I didn't know.
[6395.64s -> 6426.02s]  I didn't know like a bomb walked out of that. That was fun though. All right, slime, where's he
[6426.02s -> 6459.61s]  going? All right, we're going to do it's time for slime's level. Let's do L6, B6. Let's go. This is
[6459.61s -> 6466.17s]  called MarioAntivirus.exe. This one's going to be great. Hackers have broken through Mario's
[6466.17s -> 6475.24s]  firewall and infected his PC with bugs. Is that supposed to, is that the Windows logo? That's
[6475.24s -> 6498.10s]  awesome. Defeat all 20. Oh, okay. First door? We'll do door one. Oh, it's just there. Is this
[6498.10s -> 6507.93s]  supposed to be the computer? Oh no, a P-switch. My worst enemy. Anything else? Let me take this in
[6507.93s -> 6529.64s]  for a second though. Anything else over here to look at? No, I just want to see. God. Oh no.
[6531.64s -> 6536.34s]  Do I have to fill this in? Any more blocks hidden?
[6542.33s -> 6573.88s]  What on earth? Oh, I got four 1-ups. Where do I go from here? Up and around. Oh shit. Okay.
[6575.48s -> 6591.21s]  To hit that I think. So let's hit this. Mushroom. Can't hit that. Wait, this is like the microchip.
[6591.21s -> 6604.44s]  Okay, I see. So I gotta get all 21? Can I not kill these? I don't think I can, right?
[6605.16s -> 6620.81s]  I have to hit the POW, don't I? All right, this is two. I gotta kill these ones. Let's see. There it
[6620.81s -> 6630.04s]  is. All right, three, five. How do I get out of here? Let's go all the way to the right.
[6630.60s -> 6636.92s]  This is big. Holy shit, this is huge. Is that the firewall?
[6642.90s -> 6649.90s]  Just leave. I can't just leave. Oh shit, that's gonna be horrible.
[6650.38s -> 6663.10s]  Oh, can I? I don't think I can. Should I try it? I don't think I'm ready for that.
[6663.10s -> 6680.87s]  Where do you go? Watch out for the icicles. Oh shit, they respawn. It's seven.
[6683.74s -> 6691.19s]  I need... Oh, I just like... It's called health, but it is technically health.
[6698.87s -> 6716.46s]  Oh, the timer, you're right. Okay, hold on. I'm not gonna do this in time. Oh god,
[6717.18s -> 6734.62s]  there's so much more. Get up there. Is there any more down here? To the left?
[6735.42s -> 6745.02s]  Did I miss any over here? I'm gonna have to do this again. Did I miss any? Nine out of 21 over
[6745.02s -> 6754.87s]  here? I think I missed one on the top left. Wasting time? Well, I'm not gonna beat it,
[6754.87s -> 6768.55s]  so I might as well just see if there's anything else. Holy shit. Okay. Oh my god.
[6769.11s -> 6779.29s]  This is so big. How do I get up here? Off of your head? Give me the... I got a key now.
[6780.09s -> 6799.59s]  Can you... I think he has to kill them, doesn't he? No, what? How am I killing them? What was it?
[6799.59s -> 6809.96s]  On his head? All right, I'm gonna try this again. This time, I'm not gonna like take in the scenes.
[6809.96s -> 6828.07s]  It's a very, very pretty level for the first batch. I still don't understand what the point
[6828.15s -> 6833.43s]  of that one is. Was that a dev kit? It's probably a dev kit, something like that.
[6834.23s -> 6841.96s]  My god. It's okay. Okay, I'm like panicking for no reason. I have like, I have like 12 minutes.
[6847.13s -> 6867.22s]  Oh, it's slippery. Shit. Is those two? It is that. Got that. Any more? Shouldn't have done that. That
[6867.22s -> 6873.18s]  was a dumb idea, but I did it anyways. Oh, there was, look, there was a secret one over here. See?
[6875.14s -> 6885.02s]  Shit, I didn't think that was gonna happen. All right, that's 10. I feel like you just spawned
[6885.02s -> 6894.04s]  that in for me. All right, I gotta go through the firewall now. Get through this, though. I'm getting
[6894.04s -> 6906.12s]  hit. Through the... I gotta just go. I have to, I gotta go for it. Go for it. Okay, I'm fine.
[6906.92s -> 6917.02s]  Don't go through this door. Mushroom in here. Now this, this... All right, hold on. What does this do?
[6917.74s -> 6927.56s]  I should have known that was gonna fucking happen. Why did I just not understand that?
[6928.12s -> 6933.82s]  That's in case you miss one. I get it. I'm gonna go all the way to the right.
[6935.42s -> 6947.29s]  Oh my god. Okay, there's all this. Um, did I just get spawned on? What the hell?
[6948.41s -> 6959.24s]  Tele-frag. All right, now I know what the door does. I don't even need to grab these. I don't know
[6959.24s -> 6986.54s]  what I'm doing. Let's do the skip. Wait till it goes over that way. Got it. There it is. There it is.
[6987.50s -> 6994.15s]  Don't get that. No reason to. Same thing I did this way. All the way around. Boink.
[6998.33s -> 7007.98s]  There it is. Okay, there it is. Ten. No, yes. You hope I'm having a good day? I'm having a good day.
[7007.98s -> 7025.06s]  Hope you're having a good day too. How is your day? It's good. Here we go. Man, my brain is too
[7025.06s -> 7035.75s]  small for that. All right, let's just do this. Oh my god. No! No! Why? I just wanted this...
[7037.27s -> 7040.39s]  All right, I have to get rid of the stupid magician. This magician's pissing me off.
[7041.19s -> 7053.72s]  That's the hacker. All right, I got a key. Oh, I got another key. I can do it again.
[7055.46s -> 7071.22s]  Two keys. How many? 20. I got 12. I got 21. I got them all. How do I get out of here? What do I have
[7071.22s -> 7092.81s]  to do? Is there like an exit door? Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Like,
[7092.81s -> 7100.65s]  where? What do you mean pipe? Pipe? Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. Pipe. I don't know what you
[7100.65s -> 7104.57s]  mean by pipe. Okay, I'm fucking losing my mind. I'm freaking out. The hacker's gonna kill me.
[7104.57s -> 7128.36s]  Pipe! I got it. That was cool. That was actually really fun. Really well thought out level. That
[7128.36s -> 7142.01s]  was it's time for slime. Good shit. You look lovely today. Oh, okay. Although wait, somebody
[7142.01s -> 7149.35s]  has a fish. No, I'm not gonna do that. You look lovely today. Usually the fish gets me,
[7149.99s -> 7165.45s]  but today it's all about the compliments that get me today. You have RNG in your name here.
[7166.84s -> 7187.26s]  I wonder if that means anything. Jerma's family dinner. You can beat this in seven seconds.
[7187.26s -> 7237.53s]  Okay. Should I get the coins? The clown car? All right. It was an easy one. I'm gonna get
[7237.53s -> 7269.62s]  the world record on this. Seven seconds. Seven point three. Here we go. Was that longer than
[7269.62s -> 7330.78s]  seven seconds? No! That has to be pretty close. What? I just had it. Somebody just got a better
[7330.78s -> 7353.77s]  one than I did. What? It was seven three. Now it's seven oh? One more. I don't care. This is it.
[7353.77s -> 7366.52s]  Even if it's, uh, I don't think that was the one. Six. No. That was mine was cleaner. But again,
[7366.52s -> 7379.16s]  seven one. Seven. No, you guys can fucking fight each other over it. Hey, that was a short and
[7379.16s -> 7401.54s]  sweet one. Thank you. Beautiful also. Fuck you. All right. Yeah. Let's do that one. After this,
[7401.54s -> 7414.81s]  I'm gonna go pee. Come back and do some more. Mid-airs made easy. These mid-airs require no
[7414.81s -> 7423.74s]  kaizo skill. Red pipes provide hints if needed. Oh, this is apparently impossible.
[7426.17s -> 7435.08s]  One percent completion rate. Oh, this is gonna be tough. These mid-airs require no kaizo skill.
[7435.08s -> 7448.92s]  What? I don't know. I don't know what that means. This is way over my head. Gotta go up here?
[7449.88s -> 7465.54s]  I need another. Is this low gravity? What? Okay. Well, that changes everything.
[7466.42s -> 7501.06s]  So I have to go up, jump, and grab it, and jump? Throw it over? I don't know. Oh no. Give me that
[7501.06s -> 7516.58s]  back. The low gravity just fucked with me. Hold on. All right. So you just throw it out. Jump up
[7516.58s -> 7524.12s]  there. No. Why? I don't want to grab the fucking thing. Oh my god. I don't want to grab it. I
[7524.12s -> 7548.38s]  wanted this to... Okay. Well, we'll have to start over again. Oh, I didn't have to even go up there.
[7548.38s -> 7565.54s]  Okay. Use red pipes for a hint. Well, we don't need one yet. What are these for? I guess. I don't
[7565.54s -> 7583.80s]  know. I have to definitely jump up on this. It resets the level. Oh, okay. Is this autoscrolling?
[7585.19s -> 7585.83s]  Wait, hold on.
[7591.82s -> 7602.86s]  Get up there. Okay. And then, oh yeah, yay. Okay. Now fall through this.
[7607.43s -> 7632.30s]  Ah, something telling me I wasn't supposed to do that. Red pipe. Red pipe. Well, not yet. Well,
[7632.30s -> 7641.13s]  yes, fine. What is this showing me? Well, it actually is a full-on, this is how you beat it.
[7641.85s -> 7666.62s]  That's really cool, actually. That's a nice touch. What? I gotta get to look like the video.
[7666.62s -> 7686.33s]  Ugh. I have this problem in Mario where I have to hold down the face button. Why? Every... for
[7686.33s -> 7702.31s]  everything. No matter what. I have to. Even if I'm not trying to run. Okay. So what does this want
[7702.31s -> 7714.38s]  me to do here? Do I need to bring that up with me? Or damage boost and then I just need you to wait
[7714.38s -> 7732.22s]  like an extra five seconds is what I had to do. Okay. Let's see. That's gonna be something,
[7732.22s -> 7755.78s]  isn't it? What? All right. Oh, okay. We're fine. No. There's no red pipe here, guys.
[7757.13s -> 7771.67s]  I don't see a red pipe. No red pipe. Uh, I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.
[7773.62s -> 7793.34s]  Come on. Give me another one. Oh, damn it. Okay. How far does that go?
[7793.34s -> 7808.63s]  Shit. Then go to the checkpoint. What do I do with this thing? No red pipe either. Do I have to fall
[7808.63s -> 7815.22s]  down with it or throw it over there? I didn't see what was on the other side of this. Throw it over
[7815.22s -> 7843.51s]  there and then there's a ground. I don't have to go fast. For some reason, I think I have to fall
[7843.51s -> 7862.14s]  down and then like jump on it later. No, no, no, no, no. Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[7862.14s -> 7880.49s]  All right. And now, um, jump. I think I have to throw this, jump on top of it with the spring,
[7880.49s -> 7890.58s]  throw the spring, jump on the spring. I think. I can't reset the level ever again.
[7892.34s -> 7925.93s]  No. Oh, come on. Really? Did I seriously just do that to myself? I'm stuck. The doors.
[7927.38s -> 7932.90s]  Do you understand I'm trying to get to the doors on the left and I have ruined it for myself?
[7933.62s -> 7955.11s]  I feel like if I fall at the right angle, I might be able to... There it is. All right. I just...
[7955.11s -> 7960.84s]  Don't worry, but I'm probably gonna die because that's... I have to grab this,
[7961.80s -> 7967.32s]  throw this, stand on that. Let me just see how fast it goes. Okay. Grab that. That goes pretty damn
[7967.32s -> 7990.10s]  fast. Oh, it's the other way around. Oh, give me that. Give me this. Give that to me. Give me this.
[7990.74s -> 7999.30s]  I need that. Am I overthinking it? I have to jump, throw, and then... I think I am overthinking it.
[8012.92s -> 8019.37s]  What? I... Holding? Why? I wish there was a way I could... Is there a button that you can hold the
[8019.37s -> 8041.96s]  run without the pick up button? I wish I could press it. Let's try this again. So, throw the pow
[8041.96s -> 8067.08s]  and throw... Okay, throw the pow, throw the... Blow up! I did it. I'm gonna say I did it. I have to do
[8067.08s -> 8087.83s]  like a little trail. How far up do I need to go? No, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[8088.47s -> 8098.47s]  Did I go too high? I went too high. Shit. I can't get that back. Where's my reset button?
[8098.47s -> 8125.53s]  There's no reset door here? Shit. I gotta get it up here. No, I don't... Where's my reset door?
[8144.70s -> 8156.84s]  Usually I can get that pretty well. Although I screwed this one up last time. Oops.
[8159.32s -> 8182.18s]  Fuck. No, I usually can get this. Damn it. Holding? Why in a Mario game? Don't ever do it.
[8182.74s -> 8209.10s]  Still don't get this part though. Don't throw the pow, just use it.
[8210.86s -> 8213.94s]  I don't think that killed anything. Did that kill anything down here?
[8217.14s -> 8219.46s]  No, it didn't. I needed to see. No, it doesn't kill anything over there.
[8230.98s -> 8238.30s]  No! Just throw it. Just... I got it over there. I don't give a fuck. It's over there now, isn't it?
[8243.00s -> 8262.28s]  I'm vetoing this one. Only a few more tries and I'm vetoing this one. I didn't want to even do
[8262.28s -> 8272.63s]  that again by holding Y. Oh my god. Why would they make the run button the same as the grab button?
[8272.63s -> 8279.46s]  Everybody runs in Mario. Everybody holds that button down. Make it like L fucking 2 or something.
[8279.46s -> 8304.81s]  Why does it have to be Y? No! Fucking Y. Nothing's gonna bring me down today.
[8327.14s -> 8337.03s]  Hold X. You can't hold X and Y at the same time. You have to like turn your hand inside out. I'm
[8337.03s -> 8357.82s]  getting like tilted down. Jesus. Get me over here. Throw the... Throw the spring first and then grab
[8357.82s -> 8387.85s]  the pow. I'm gonna just go. Oh my god. I hate it. All right. Three more attempts and I'm stamping
[8387.85s -> 8438.95s]  the veto on this one. No. No. No. No. I don't think so. I'm just gonna take the... I'm just gonna
[8438.95s -> 8458.26s]  damage boost over it. I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna be able to do that shit. Nope. No. God
[8458.26s -> 8473.11s]  damn it. This shit is fucking so difficult. He's like throw, jump, grab. This wasn't in Mario 2.
[8473.91s -> 8491.58s]  I don't have the momentum to go all the way... I'm just gonna damage boost it I think.
[8492.14s -> 8497.24s]  Because I don't have... I don't... I'm not getting the momentum to go forward to jump on the spring.
[8498.04s -> 8526.23s]  How far... What is... So that just flies forward and then jump across. How far does this go? Grab, jump.
[8526.95s -> 8534.47s]  Get on the roof. I don't think I need to... I don't... If I get on the roof I lose the spring.
[8537.03s -> 8545.62s]  Uh that was weird. Try it again. Don't jump. I'm not jump throwing. I'm just walking.
[8549.26s -> 8558.14s]  I don't care. All right. Now this is important. I need to get this spring on that spike.
[8559.10s -> 8565.42s]  How do I do that without screwing this up? This is gonna be so bad.
[8566.70s -> 8571.75s]  I got it. I got it. Okay. I did it. I did it. Just don't touch the spikes.
[8572.31s -> 8578.06s]  And then I jump off this one. I can do this. I can do it. I'm gonna do it.
[8578.70s -> 8600.79s]  And that's fucking scary. Oh yes. Yes. Yes. There's a checkpoint. Thank God. Yes. Excellent.
[8600.79s -> 8612.06s]  I'm so happy there's a checkpoint here. What a gracious dev. I know. Thank you gracious dev.
[8613.90s -> 8617.34s]  So you gotta go. It took me a long time to die.
[8624.76s -> 8628.20s]  Damn. All right. I gotta hit that and fall and then go back and hit again.
[8649.22s -> 8662.17s]  Springs. He's throwing. Spring. Easy. I can't pick this up. So wait. Do I just bounce off this to get
[8662.17s -> 8665.69s]  faster momentum and then jump over? Hold on. How far does it go?
[8666.33s -> 8697.78s]  Okay. And did I screw it up? I think I screwed it up. I'm trying to time it so I can.
[8699.64s -> 8711.26s]  I think it's over. So you gotta go right away. Oh boy. And you gotta hit the ones up here.
[8711.98s -> 8714.78s]  The two. Oh dear. All right. You gotta do it all in one go.
[8726.42s -> 8729.48s]  Did I have to keep going? I don't think I had to keep going.
[8730.57s -> 8740.38s]  Uh and then up. Oh I don't know. I don't know. I think I have to run really fast
[8740.38s -> 8756.04s]  and jump and throw this and hit this. I think. Oops-a-daisy. Yeah that's what I have to do.
[8756.04s -> 8775.29s]  I probably could have jumped on top of that but I don't understand. Oh guess what I did. I pressed Y.
[8775.29s -> 8792.34s]  The right trigger should be grabbed. Can I remap that?
[8794.26s -> 8799.06s]  You know you're starting to get annoyed in Mario when you want to remap the controls
[8799.06s -> 8802.26s]  in Mario. Like that's when you know that you're like actually getting angry.
[8802.26s -> 8808.15s]  How do I remap the fucking controls in Mario 2? Really? Shit.
[8840.18s -> 8845.53s]  Maybe I should just try to keep going left. That would just make me jump up this way.
[8845.77s -> 8852.63s]  That wouldn't do much for me would it? I'm kind of confused but wouldn't I just jump up?
[8855.56s -> 8864.78s]  I have to actually start the hold X and Y at the same time but then you have to let go of Y.
[8864.78s -> 8893.78s]  That's so awkward. Just throw the spring. Holy shit. Okay well I have one. Is that what I'm
[8893.78s -> 8920.86s]  supposed to do? Why did it not do that? What happened? I get the secret level. 17 minutes.
[8921.50s -> 8927.70s]  Who can beat that in a minute? He missed the true ending. I don't get true endings. Don't you know
[8927.70s -> 8933.03s]  that? 1.5% completion. I'm good. Get the true ending. I don't get true endings.
[8933.75s -> 8951.80s]  That was fucking hard. That was challenging. Very cool though. Yeah it's time for a pee break.
[8952.92s -> 8959.32s]  I'll be right back. Go do what you need to do. See you guys in like two minutes. Be right back.
[8959.32s -> 9119.94s]  I'm back. So where are we going now? You will consider mine. It even has a fish.
[9120.90s -> 9131.34s]  I absolutely will consider that. Fail fish. Oh okay I get it. Now I see what you mean.
[9137.90s -> 9151.29s]  I think did you type it in wrong? I think did you mean that? Why can I not? Let's see.
[9152.01s -> 9169.58s]  This is wrong. Why can I not type? I think the code is wrong. Why is Z? What's going on?
[9176.36s -> 9180.76s]  Why is Z, I, and O not available? Because they look like 2s, 1s, and 0s?
[9183.67s -> 9192.06s]  All right. Oh so that person just it was a made-up level. All right.
[9192.86s -> 9219.83s]  I see fun cool level please. I'll do this one. Not too hard for you. What do you mean for me?
[9220.55s -> 9234.98s]  It's called thwomp. Thank you for the level. Standard puzzle solving. For me or for you?
[9235.54s -> 9246.31s]  I thought I had to hit that with my head but nope. Let's go.
[9258.09s -> 9266.18s]  Oh it's in 3D world. This sucks automatically. That's not true. Um I gotta jump up,
[9266.18s -> 9289.35s]  dodge that, jump around, get the P, and then get the V. What's going on? Oh.
[9289.51s -> 9307.24s]  Oh. Can I get it back? Secret. Secret way. I always beat it secret way.
[9309.32s -> 9329.88s]  I actually kind of want to go that way. All right. Let's go.
[9340.62s -> 9346.18s]  I just made myself fucking like two times bigger when you play
[9346.18s -> 9354.76s]  Super Mario dog shit 3D gets stuck to the wall become like fly paper when you play Super Mario
[9354.76s -> 9382.68s]  3D world. What? What happened to my? Did you see the bottom of the screen? I don't think.
[9386.52s -> 9389.48s]  Super fucking 3D fly paper. That's what this should be called.
[9411.21s -> 9422.23s]  3D world man. Oh and there's an end. They make it so you can't get up here.
[9422.23s -> 9427.56s]  All right. I'm gonna be all right. I thought you said you liked 3D world.
[9428.76s -> 9434.76s]  Oh.
[9460.65s -> 9475.45s]  I don't know. Up. I get it. Blasphemy.
[9478.01s -> 9506.52s]  I feel like I have a backpack full of cement on when I played Mario 3D world.
[9526.92s -> 9537.26s]  I'm getting three. I don't like 3D world. I remember when I opened the Wii,
[9537.26s -> 9541.42s]  whatever it was, I got it. I played Mario 3D world like 30 minutes and I was like I don't like this
[9541.42s -> 9569.58s]  game. You understand? You understand what happened? You understand? What the fuck is going
[9569.58s -> 9583.19s]  on? New Super Mario Brothers 3D whatever is it's equal parts like floaty and heavy at the same time.
[9605.05s -> 9634.76s]  So you know when you eat a huge fucking meal right at the last bite you feel like shit and you're
[9634.76s -> 9643.24s]  wicked way down like I shouldn't have eaten that last bite. I feel like I have like a stomach full
[9643.24s -> 9653.16s]  of fucking a bunch of like meat and cheese and shit. I don't understand what's happening now.
[9653.88s -> 9700.50s]  Yeah, Super Mario New Wii 3D full pizza. Can you do it again? Please? Can I get this to happen again?
[9716.90s -> 9721.78s]  Extra large fucking steak and cheese. Somebody gave me subs. JermaSucks gave me five subs.
[9723.54s -> 9754.58s]  Now just go down and then what the fuck do I do here? Oh okay YouTube.
[9756.26s -> 9764.81s]  All right I'm doing this a few more times. Only a few more times.
[9767.08s -> 9780.54s]  And no more Mario 3D world levels before I fucking puke. All right, just kill me. Do you remember
[9780.54s -> 9786.62s]  the last time we played this? What was the game that made me like very upset? It wasn't Mario
[9786.62s -> 9811.34s]  World. It wasn't Mario 2. It wasn't like Mario 64. It was these ones. I don't even have it if it's
[9811.34s -> 9817.58s]  that. Oh my god. That fucking wall jump is like equal parts impossible to do and equal parts like
[9817.58s -> 9858.44s]  too easy to get stuck. How is it possible? What the fuck happened? All right this is it. Last
[9858.44s -> 9877.50s]  no this is the last try. Keep my mouth shut. I know this game is like a 9.8 on IGN. I'm talking
[9877.50s -> 9881.66s]  about Mario 3D World. I know. I know but every game that's a Mario game has to be a nine or
[9881.66s -> 9932.23s]  you go out of business. You understand? Oh this isn't 3D World. No I know but you know the new
[9932.23s -> 9964.42s]  Super Mario Wii Brothers. Whatever the hell it's called. Luigi plays Wii. Whatever the hell it is.
[9964.42s -> 9977.74s]  Can't beat this land. Well you know it's uh this is Joel's level. Oh great. 0.1% this 58,000 attempts
[9977.74s -> 9997.27s]  here. Do you think I'm gonna be able to do this? I'm not gonna be able to do this. Oh god. I don't
[9997.27s -> 10004.76s]  even want to know. You have to get all the key things. Oh I feel so I feel right at home though.
[10004.76s -> 10026.12s]  This is Mario 3. Okay. Watch out for the Goomba. Should I go underneath? How am I gonna get under
[10026.12s -> 10042.81s]  this? Oh this just gets worse by the second. What do I do? Underneath. Oh god. Wait. Hold on. Slow down.
[10043.45s -> 10056.65s]  Slow down. Ah. No. No. I needed that. What? How do I get that and then go?
[10059.32s -> 10065.24s]  God. You have to go around? How do you pick that up? Go up on top and okay.
[10066.20s -> 10085.02s]  Oh this is gonna be hell. Okay I'm going. For a second I thought I could do that. I don't know why.
[10085.82s -> 10089.83s]  That might be a little secret though. You might actually feel good today. You know what I'm saying?
[10089.83s -> 10109.21s]  Okay it took Joel 20 hours to beat this and he's the one that made it. It actually literally took
[10109.93s -> 10118.10s]  20. I think I can do that. I think it's possible to go right when. That's the little skip. That's
[10118.10s -> 10130.57s]  the dev skip. Okay let's try this again. Oh man. It was 20 hours across two different streams.
[10131.93s -> 10151.14s]  I'm gonna try this. Hold on. Where's the one that comes out?
[10151.22s -> 10167.88s]  What doesn't come out? Why would I go this way? I thought.
[10177.82s -> 10188.25s]  Oh man. I'm not gonna be able to do this. See? That's what I mean. Then go down with it.
[10196.60s -> 10206.55s]  I can't even get this first jump correct. All right. I need to. Is it the top of the coin on
[10206.55s -> 10232.82s]  the arrow? Somebody do it. Kill it. Kill it. Somebody kill it. Kill them. It's not the last
[10232.82s -> 10253.83s]  coin. I have to get this jump down and I don't know what point it is. What else I can do? I'm
[10253.83s -> 10263.80s]  just gonna go now. No no no no no no no. Then. Oh man. That sucks. I gotta get the star and then
[10263.80s -> 10291.78s]  come back and go all the way around. Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. What?
[10291.78s -> 10315.30s]  Can I? Can I do that? Can I do this? Can I actually do this? If it. Oh! Joel 19 hours
[10315.30s -> 10321.58s]  when knowing how to do it. Uh yeah. I mean I'm willing to just have a little bit of fun with it
[10321.58s -> 10338.26s]  but I'm never gonna beat this. I need to at least get this first jump correct. What if I just say
[10338.26s -> 10360.20s]  fuck it? No. I'm not gonna go that way. Man this is gonna be hell. I have an idea. Though the name
[10360.20s -> 10386.22s]  of this level is called. I get it. I can't get it. Does that not work? Oh shit! What? Okay. No no no
[10386.22s -> 10403.10s]  no no no. Wait wait wait. Get me out of here. Um what do I do? I don't know. I don't know. I don't
[10403.10s -> 10423.02s]  know. You have to run. Just run and jump? I at least have to get to the end of this. You gotta
[10423.02s -> 10450.54s]  kid me. Why? I'm dead. All right just run. I'm just gonna run and then jump. Do I keep holding this?
[10453.13s -> 10499.99s]  I don't know. Oh my. Nooooo. That's fucking insane. You gotta get that little pixel.
[10500.95s -> 10529.10s]  What? How do you even program that to work? How does that work? Yeah how did he do this
[10529.10s -> 10537.10s]  for like 20 straight hours? At hour number four? I don't think I would. I think I'd be like guys
[10537.10s -> 10559.02s]  I have to leave. I'll see you like tomorrow. And tomorrow I'm not doing this. How did I get it the
[10559.02s -> 10568.86s]  first few times easily? Don't go faster than the shell. That would be a mistake.
[10584.02s -> 10591.88s]  Yeah I don't know about this one. Yeah I don't know. I don't know about this one.
[10598.47s -> 10622.01s]  Why does my microphone sound like it's on fire? It's clearly not. Come on please. I don't go that
[10622.09s -> 10639.42s]  fast. All right now I'm gonna do this. Get this and then fall here. All right going.
[10643.90s -> 10649.13s]  It was a laugh. Somebody laughed. I don't know. I don't know why this is supposed to be funny.
[10649.13s -> 10669.21s]  Why is this funny? I obviously can't jump over there. Do I just lose? I think I might just lose.
[10673.42s -> 10694.71s]  All right so that door doesn't do anything. You know how I get with this kind of shit though.
[10694.71s -> 10701.51s]  Like I'm gonna be here. I'm not gonna be here for much longer. I can't. We got like all the
[10701.51s -> 10715.78s]  viewer levels to do. I'm not gonna do this the whole time. I'll be here for a year. All right
[10715.78s -> 10724.50s]  now. So how? I shouldn't. Should I not get this? If I get the. Okay so I have to damage boost.
[10728.33s -> 10768.42s]  What? No. So I have to wait till the mushroom gets down and then get hurt and then run. This
[10768.42s -> 10812.97s]  shit over there. Do I have to jump over there or something? I thought that was it. Go. Oh my god I
[10812.97s -> 10819.96s]  have to go. I just panicked. I didn't want to hit the thing. I was gonna hit it. All right so let me
[10819.96s -> 10835.50s]  hold on a minute. If I hit the mushroom and then the mushroom touches me while I'm small. Like
[10835.50s -> 10871.30s]  walk, get hurt, run, damage boost. You can't make that jump. You can't make those jumps.
[10872.26s -> 10893.21s]  But where do I stop? It didn't even. That was. It didn't kill the thing up there. I was gonna die.
[10893.77s -> 10919.75s]  Look at this again. The shell comes down. Does it come all the way over here? Does another one come
[10919.75s -> 10930.89s]  up? Where does that one go? Okay it bounces over here and then where does it go from here?
[10932.58s -> 10944.06s]  Nowhere. It hits a switch. Okay what is it hitting? I gotta just kind of run.
[10944.54s -> 10983.21s]  Okay hold on. I can go in there when it's red? I have no idea. And then just try to stop.
[10988.86s -> 11002.57s]  Fuck. Is there a safe zone? I don't know where the safe part is. But thankfully I can do this
[11002.57s -> 11017.43s]  pretty easily now. Oh that was bullshit. I brought the shell with me the first time and I don't have
[11017.43s -> 11034.17s]  to get on top of the shell. How would I do that? This level is named after Central British time.
[11034.17s -> 11042.76s]  Yeah I know. But there's got to be like a solution. All right I'm gonna a few more tries.
[11043.64s -> 11062.60s]  Do I actually need the shell? All right I'm skipping it. I'm gonna skip it after like two more.
[11062.60s -> 11068.07s]  If I can't get, if I can't figure this out, there's probably like another 75 hours to this.
[11073.86s -> 11088.04s]  Oh god. Do I have to get all those too? The solution is to punch yourself in the groin for
[11088.04s -> 11103.13s]  a couple dozen hours. That's true. Although no that's not the solution. I at least want to
[11103.13s -> 11136.04s]  get through here one more time. Really? Shit. Okay um I can't make that jump. Hold on let me test
[11137.88s -> 11161.54s]  No there's no way. That's gonna kill me. No fuck. No come on. No no. How did I make it worse?
[11162.42s -> 11197.45s]  What is that? How do I get over there? All right this is it. I can't, I can't, I it's crazy level
[11197.45s -> 11205.77s]  and it's fun. It's fucking crazy. But I gotta, I gotta move on. You're telling me that I need to jump
[11205.77s -> 11215.54s]  over these and that's the way to do it. That's what you're trying to tell me? You're telling
[11216.02s -> 11236.26s]  you're telling me that I have to jump over each one of these. Every single one. Oh my god. You
[11236.26s -> 11271.32s]  have to keep the momentum going to just keep going. If you stop you're dead. No. No way. No way. I'm
[11271.32s -> 11276.04s]  not doing it. I'm done. I'm done. No fucking way. We're out. That's it. That's it for this one. No
[11276.04s -> 11280.44s]  more of this one. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. No. No. No. You're gonna do the whole thing
[11280.44s -> 11292.36s]  all the way down? There's no way. It's not fucking happen. You gotta be kidding me. Because then
[11292.36s -> 11303.02s]  you're gonna turn and do it down the bottom. Holy shit. How did you ever beat this? Even if you
[11303.02s -> 11316.74s]  memorize this, there's like a tiny bit of human error. I want to just see the failure. Watch the
[11316.82s -> 11341.02s]  clip. Are you serious? How would you even do this? There's no way. You've got to be fucking
[11341.02s -> 11347.42s]  kidding me. You have to follow the mushroom all the way. The whole way.
[11356.02s -> 11402.78s]  Look at this shit. Are you ready for this? You have to fucking pick this up. Thanks for watching
[11402.78s -> 11423.90s]  everybody. I can't even get past the first three blocks. It looks like he's walking it too. Is he
[11423.90s -> 11452.46s]  walking it? He wasn't running. He's walking. Come on. Get walking. I can do this. Here we go.
[11453.10s -> 11467.10s]  Wait. What's in front of me? You gotta hit and jump around it. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I'm not
[11467.10s -> 11480.38s]  doing it. It's too hard. And that's not even like... There's no way. Only 84 people have completed
[11480.38s -> 11491.02s]  that. Out of 58,000 attempts. Now that's an incredibly difficult level. Thank you Joel for
[11491.02s -> 11511.56s]  making it fun. What's next? This one. Thank you to Germaput Sunchips in F tier. That's a pretty
[11511.56s -> 11561.56s]  great name. And then RSF. Let's give it a try. Stop acting. Minus two dying Jill. Okay. Okay.
[11561.56s -> 11596.76s]  All right. Let's try it again. Oh, I can do... I can do the... Can I even make that? I don't think
[11596.76s -> 11628.39s]  I can make that. I'm not sure I can. Whoa. Whoa. What the fuck? Okay. So that was interesting.
[11629.43s -> 11640.81s]  You gotta get on that lower level. Toad's fat ass just hit the hit. That was... Sorry. Toad's diaper
[11640.81s -> 11649.85s]  hitbox. Why am I Toad? I don't want to be Toad anymore. How do I change character? How do I
[11649.85s -> 11673.93s]  change character? Slide down. Right there. On off. And then. And then. And then. And then. And then.
[11673.93s -> 11678.41s]  And then. Ah! I gotta... Is there... Do I get another one? Do I get another turtle?
[11679.45s -> 11733.59s]  Shit. I'm holding it down. I swear to god. No! No! No! Give me that turtle. No. God damn it. Come on.
[11733.59s -> 11743.72s]  Really? I got stuck. Come here. Oh shit. No. No, no, no. Turn... Stop. Stop it. Please.
[11744.68s -> 11753.59s]  No. I gotta pick it up. Oh my god. I am gonna fuck it. My soul is leaving my body.
[11753.59s -> 11773.13s]  I'm alright. I'm not mad. I'm not mad. I'm not mad. I'm fine. Nothing's gonna make me mad today.
[11773.13s -> 11787.21s]  Tell you. You know why. September 21st. You gotta plan on September 21st to cancel it. Wait, do I...
[11787.21s -> 11853.69s]  I gotta leave that on. No! I wanted to jump on his head. Fuck. Now what? How fast is he? What?
[11857.94s -> 11874.81s]  What? I'm just gonna hold right. There's nothing else I can do there. Do I have to actually kill
[11874.81s -> 11923.21s]  that thing? No! Now he's too close. Fuck. I like this one. Come on. I wonder if there's more.
[11925.05s -> 11947.91s]  This is the one. He ain't even close. They're all cheering him on. Alright. From here I gotta jump
[11947.99s -> 11963.58s]  to... Anything else? I'm scared. Can I make this jump? What? No! I... It... The slide. I thought the
[11963.58s -> 11977.26s]  slide was gonna... It slides. Oh. Um. You know. The slide. I don't know why. You can slide up.
[11978.30s -> 11997.75s]  Can you? I don't know. I don't remember that. Can you? I don't know. God. Why did you do that?
[12019.74s -> 12030.54s]  He's dead. Wait. Is he... Is he gonna go the other way? Alright. I'm gonna kill him and then we don't
[12030.54s -> 12062.20s]  have to worry about it. I swear to God. I'm just trying. I'm trying. I'm really trying.
[12063.16s -> 12072.89s]  Damn it. This game, man. This game. It's just... It's too much sometimes. I'm trying. Now I'm just
[12072.89s -> 12105.24s]  singly jumping. Not even twist jumping. I'm just normal jumping. I think he's gonna catch me. I
[12105.24s -> 12127.82s]  don't think I did it fast enough. Alright. That was really close. And then... Is that it? There's a
[12127.82s -> 12131.26s]  troll coming up. I know it. There's gonna be some... A block or a brick or a hammer or a
[12132.54s -> 12136.14s]  block or something that's gonna stop me. I don't know what it is but it's gonna happen.
[12137.66s -> 12140.66s]  I don't know what it is. Something bad's gonna happen right here. I don't know what it is.
[12141.94s -> 12168.58s]  Uh. How do I... I need to have the shell hit that but I can't get it. Alright. So then
[12169.54s -> 12186.12s]  go in here? I think. What hap... What? Um. What do I do? Now what do I do? Which way? Which way do I go?
[12187.56s -> 12211.00s]  To the right? Oh no! There's a guy coming. There's a guy coming. Wait. No. No. It was coming. I knew
[12211.00s -> 12217.08s]  it was gonna happen. I knew it was gonna happen. I knew there was gonna be something there that
[12217.08s -> 12222.04s]  caused a huge problem. Why would there be music there if there wasn't something bad or scary or
[12222.04s -> 12241.40s]  watch out! Look out! Imagine being this high strung for a kids game. Uh. No. This is this is
[12241.40s -> 12254.68s]  not a kids game. Kids don't do this. Can't be. This is this is like a... No. Nuh-uh. This is like a
[12254.68s -> 12283.94s]  Newgrounds parody game. You know what I'm saying? This is not like Super Mario. Is it enough?
[12284.58s -> 12297.78s]  Mm-hmm. No! Oh! Just barely enough. It's just barely enough. Okay hold on. Don't screw it up.
[12299.38s -> 12307.50s]  Cross. Alright. Now it's just you land, you kill both the things, then you land and run
[12307.50s -> 12327.74s]  instantly. At least that's what I think I have to do. Let's do it. Get them both crushed. Okay.
[12328.95s -> 12356.44s]  Fall and then run. Two. Go! That was fun. That was a good one. No that was that was cool. Really
[12356.44s -> 12371.13s]  good. Nice job. Everyone's done a nice job. Just because you have a Super Mario 3D world level
[12371.13s -> 12385.34s]  doesn't mean your level is bad. It's just like you know. Here's a pallet cleanser. I'll do the
[12385.34s -> 12404.78s]  pallet cleanser for sure. Tea. I'm into the pallet cleanser level. Snow-capped mountain climbing.
[12405.34s -> 12409.74s]  Enjoy the scenic sights of snow-covered mountains and even ghost flunking. I can't
[12409.74s -> 12439.46s]  wait to play this one. Mountain climbing. This is a pallet cleanser. This is what I'm talking about.
[12439.46s -> 12473.03s]  This is great. Should I go down? I'm gonna go down. Save it. Alright. Baby level. No. Not every single
[12473.03s -> 12483.48s]  level in Mario Maker has to be like burn my eyes with hot stones. Everything doesn't have to be
[12483.48s -> 12516.23s]  like as hard as possible. I don't know why but for some reason apparently all levels
[12516.23s -> 12524.15s]  in Mario Maker have to be like blast death metal and slam monster energy drinks and scream
[12524.79s -> 12530.34s]  while you run forward and then jump like a thousand times. Sometimes you just want to do
[12530.34s -> 12541.40s]  some mountain climbing and that was fun. I did it. I don't have to go take the baseball bat.
[12541.40s -> 12545.32s]  Lean forward with the bat. Put my head on it. Spin around in a circle 20 times and then pick
[12545.32s -> 12560.87s]  up the controller. That was fun. What a nice pallet cleanser. We got a medium difficulty right here
[12560.87s -> 12593.86s]  and you got it. Nice job. Okay this is called trampolines in the sky. Challenging platforming
[12593.86s -> 12618.15s]  course. Crouch while releasing springs to drop. 13 minutes. Holy fuck. Only one person has cleared
[12618.15s -> 12699.51s]  this. Do I take this? Okay. I think I hit a switch somewhere. Don't throw it. No. Crouch
[12699.51s -> 12731.00s]  to drop. Try this again. There's the switch. That was close. So now that switch is done.
[12731.24s -> 12746.31s]  Then up here. Now the claw machine thing.
[12748.79s -> 12767.11s]  I want that 50. It's right there. It's giving me. It's not that even that greedy. It's just
[12767.11s -> 12773.27s]  clear. Okay I'm fine. All right so now we was I not supposed something happened over there
[12773.27s -> 12784.30s]  on the right? All right I don't want to die here. What happens now? Okay.
[12788.06s -> 12794.86s]  Uh spring comes out of here. I wonder. Should I just go up from here?
[12798.30s -> 12808.38s]  Can't. Um up through there? No don't kick it.
[12823.14s -> 12824.42s]  I'm gonna bring this back over here.
[12824.42s -> 12831.30s]  Um kind of. Should I go up?
[12834.10s -> 12845.74s]  Come on. I think I have to do this. Drop it. Why does my face hurt?
[12846.97s -> 12860.04s]  I don't know man. Oh shit. That's not what I wanted. There's a checkpoint right there too.
[12867.45s -> 12885.27s]  Oh my god. What have I done? How long is it going to take me to do this until I do the
[12885.27s -> 12902.52s]  mechanic that it says in the description? Yeah I gotta throw shit around. Give me.
[12905.48s -> 12911.50s]  Where's the other one? Where are my trampolines? Did I? Where's this one?
[12912.38s -> 12957.69s]  Give it to me. What? Oops. Give it here. I'm not gonna get it.
[12961.21s -> 12964.34s]  No no no no. Just fall. I'm trying to think if I could do something else there.
[12966.26s -> 12971.32s]  I gotta get up there so I have to jump from the spring over here.
[12972.28s -> 12976.63s]  Right. I'm just gonna try it. See what happens.
[12978.87s -> 12989.38s]  I didn't want to get grabbed but fine. All right now if I drop it right now.
[12991.54s -> 13016.04s]  Oh that's it. Okay I gotta get caught. Okay then get caught again and bring this around on here.
[13016.92s -> 13021.48s]  Do I wanna do this? I guess.
[13024.12s -> 13027.42s]  Up there.
[13031.35s -> 13046.84s]  No. I didn't have to go all the way back down. Why am I going so fast?
[13069.74s -> 13075.82s]  Okay that was. I gotta skip this one. It's cool but I like just my fucking finger just slipped.
[13087.32s -> 13090.76s]  I like I was in the air and then I let go but then I hit it again somehow.
[13090.76s -> 13124.76s]  I'll do this one. Frigid cavern run. Oh shit. It's another one of these.
[13125.80s -> 13128.84s]  My first level there are two 1-ups so you're under a time limit. Shit.
[13129.64s -> 13152.86s]  Oh let's give it a try. 29 seconds. Oh fuck. All right you gotta.
[13161.30s -> 13177.00s]  All right. I think you go too fast if you bounce off that one.
[13177.64s -> 13199.78s]  Oh I should have seen that coming from a mile away. Inferno. Thank you Inferno for the five community
[13199.78s -> 13215.05s]  subs. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. I gotta dump the whole thing. Thanks for the
[13215.05s -> 13243.70s]  five subs. Thank you. Do I need the key? Oh I need the coin. Uh oh. Ice is killing me.
[13247.91s -> 13249.75s]  You're taking a shot every time I die.
[13255.38s -> 13263.29s]  How on earth are you supposed to get that in an ice level that has 30 seconds on the clock?
[13291.21s -> 13321.10s]  Shit I didn't get it. Oh my god. Shit.
[13321.18s -> 13350.02s]  I'm going so. I'm going to slow down a little because I don't know what's even.
[13376.62s -> 13380.06s]  Damn man. How are you supposed to do that so fast?
[13387.78s -> 13402.31s]  Hope I don't need it. Let me just get up there and see. What the hell is even up here?
[13404.50s -> 13409.30s]  Do I have to jump over the whole thing with a small jump? I don't even know if I can do that.
[13410.26s -> 13432.76s]  I think I have to jump, hit the ceiling, and then land and then fall.
[13432.76s -> 13437.06s]  I think. I actually need to get up there and try again. I just don't understand what I want to do there.
[13451.53s -> 13472.62s]  Yes. No. I don't get it. All right. A handful more attention I gotta move on.
[13474.82s -> 13477.34s]  Did this bounce back and kill me?
[13477.74s -> 13495.54s]  It starts to blend together, man. It just mixes up into a bunch of colors in your brain.
[13495.54s -> 13503.38s]  Humans weren't supposed to be doing this. You know what I'm saying? People were farming 500 years ago.
[13503.38s -> 13524.62s]  Your brain's not supposed to do this. People were riding in horse and buggy and oh good evening,
[13524.62s -> 13531.18s]  madame. Yes, sir. I'll take two sheep. My eyes are wide open and we're hearing the same sounds and
[13531.18s -> 13535.26s]  my eyes are wide open and we're hearing the same sounds and the same images over and over again,
[13535.26s -> 13557.93s]  screaming at us. We weren't supposed to be doing this. The ice is killing me, too.
[13557.93s -> 13569.06s]  The ice. It's the ice. The fucking ice is killing me. I need to figure out this jump
[13569.06s -> 13574.86s]  because the ice keeps slowing me down. See what I'm saying? I get them. How the fuck?
[13575.98s -> 13582.98s]  I figured it out. I just did it. I did it. What do I do? I have 10 seconds. Go. Just get up there.
[13583.62s -> 13594.42s]  Did I just beat it? Oh my god, I beat it. I did it. I didn't mean to do that. I did it. Okay,
[13594.42s -> 13616.01s]  I can do this. And I'm gonna keep in track of how many levels I've completed by accident
[13616.01s -> 13621.26s]  that are one percent levels, two percent levels. It's been at least two or three.
[13621.98s -> 13630.34s]  Let me try this one for real. No, I can't do this again. These speed runners just get in my brain.
[13630.34s -> 13648.06s]  No!
[13665.42s -> 13675.50s]  All right, last try. That's it. I'm out. That was that one. That doesn't count.
[13676.54s -> 13683.13s]  One more try where I get to the top. My birthday candle just went out.
[13683.13s -> 13693.66s]  Don't make me laugh right now. Stop it. What? That doesn't count. That doesn't count. That doesn't
[13693.66s -> 13708.36s]  count. That doesn't count. Just wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me just get up there with the key.
[13718.54s -> 13722.06s]  Come on. Oh, I just need to get... I can't do four minutes. Come on.
[13723.02s -> 13745.82s]  This is it. I promise. Come on. Go! Go! I have the key. Please just get over here. All right,
[13745.82s -> 13758.09s]  I got the key. Got the key. Got the key. Which door? That's all this did? What? That's it.
[13763.88s -> 13771.78s]  Oh, god damn. Whatever. I don't care. That was a good one. That was fun. All right, give me
[13771.78s -> 13796.42s]  enough. Give me the next one. All right, this person said pretty please. Okay. I always go into
[13796.42s -> 13804.26s]  these streams with just like a really open mind and I like I don't want to like just start like
[13804.26s -> 13815.00s]  talking shit about games and I always goes back to like Mario 3D Wii. I always start it. I'm fine,
[13815.00s -> 13827.21s]  but like they oh it never fails. All right, this is called Sandwich? Let arrows, left arrows are
[13827.21s -> 13837.99s]  tap R, up or hold R, jump on thwomps. Left arrows are tap R, up or hold R. Left is R, up is hold R.
[13840.33s -> 13855.11s]  Left is right, up is right. This is gonna take a little bit of messing around. Left is right,
[13855.11s -> 13871.77s]  up is right. How did I get underneath? I don't even know how I got underneath them. Can you jump on
[13871.77s -> 13883.00s]  top of these in this one? No. It's the R button? That's not. Why didn't he move?
[13884.20s -> 13903.03s]  Yeah, you can spin jump. Okay. Hold R, up is... Is this like an activator? He went real fast.
[13904.95s -> 13930.31s]  I thought he was gonna move. He's going too fast. Okay. I still don't... I don't... What was the whole
[13930.31s -> 13977.93s]  point of that description? What the fuck? I know it's a reset door, but I'm trying to figure out
[13977.93s -> 13993.50s]  how to like hit this. I have no fucking idea what's happening. All I know is that I died.
[14000.82s -> 14012.28s]  Do I have to activate that one? I'm looking at the end. No, I can't make that whole thing.
[14014.28s -> 14044.38s]  Jesus. This is pretty awkward, but it's fun. Did something wrong there.
[14044.46s -> 14064.92s]  All right. What is the difference here? So maybe I should forget about the guy down here?
[14064.92s -> 14078.02s]  Just activate the one over to the right? Who gives a shit? You gotta be kidding me.
[14086.58s -> 14114.30s]  I'm doing it. I can get it. Okay, then I'm gonna fall now. Why? I thought I hit it in the head.
[14114.30s -> 14152.92s]  Come on. I'm upset about that. I'm actually upset about that. He's actually upset. No, that one was
[14152.92s -> 14174.68s]  fun. I did the secret. Classic Mario. Let's try that one. I don't think there's been... There's been
[14174.68s -> 14181.26s]  not very many classic regular Nintendo Mario levels, have there? I think there was one or two.
[14189.05s -> 14208.07s]  Bowser's Sky Gauntlet. A five-part gauntlet courtesy of the classic King Koopa. All right.
[14210.25s -> 14242.98s]  Gauntlet? A boss rush? All right, somebody said the last level and it's fucking with my head right
[14242.98s -> 14247.70s]  now. I don't know why. Somebody said that he's the only person to die to a green Koopa. Somebody
[14247.70s -> 14251.86s]  said that like five minutes ago and it's in my head right now because I saw a green Koopa.
[14257.61s -> 14280.58s]  That hitbox is weird. Holy shit. I just tried to jump on that like it was a platform. You idiot.
[14282.10s -> 14313.94s]  He's dead. I got him. I did it. Bad ending. A minute and three seconds. Not bad. All right,
[14313.94s -> 14318.90s]  this one says very important level. Let's find out. That was good. That was fun.
[14321.10s -> 14324.14s]  Mario 3D World. Your favorite. I'm not even gonna... I'm not gonna open that one.
[14337.61s -> 14354.41s]  A useful lesson. A simple level with a very important message. This one's kind of freaking
[14354.41s -> 14371.08s]  me out a little. I'm... I'm kind of afraid of this one. Okay. What's your important message that is
[14371.72s -> 14399.35s]  rank? And yeah, that's true. That's... don't... yeah. That's... no, that's a great... that's a good
[14399.35s -> 14419.69s]  message. That's a really good message actually. That's a really good one. Don't do that. That's
[14419.69s -> 14432.26s]  simple level with a very important message. 95%. So would you just like get there and like not...
[14432.90s -> 14438.12s]  you must have like saw... maybe you're just like, ah, I don't want to play this one. It's a word one.
[14438.20s -> 14472.71s]  All right, here's this one. 2WN95GG. Big boom booms castle. Collect Mario's mount
[14472.71s -> 14491.78s]  and armor to defeat the lord of castle boom. Get the mount and the armor. Sure. But I'm not...
[14491.78s -> 14500.76s]  okay, how do I... I change character by here, right? Settings. Where do you actually do this?
[14500.76s -> 14516.30s]  I don't want to be Toad anymore. Um, let's... let's be Super Mario. Okay. Sorry, Toad. You're out.
[14519.19s -> 14532.12s]  That's a normie thing to do. No, the normie thing would be I'm gonna be like somebody...
[14532.12s -> 14562.23s]  I'm gonna be like Toad! Why am I just running over this? And go! Fast. Wow, that's a big drop. Okay.
[14562.23s -> 14574.89s]  Mario is the gibbous of Mario games. That doesn't even make any sense at all.
[14576.31s -> 14580.79s]  That's too fast. It's too fast. I gotta wait till it's like almost all the way done.
[14581.75s -> 14597.43s]  It's not the gibbous. Mario is the the actual engine that the game runs on. Now let's go here.
[14598.15s -> 14613.48s]  Back up there right now. Oh, let's check this out first.
[14614.36s -> 14636.97s]  Let's go through this. Is this the armor? Does this count as like the shield of the armor?
[14637.85s -> 14652.34s]  How do I get that coin? I can't believe somebody just said spin.
[14655.67s -> 14661.03s]  And I listened to them. Why did I listen to you? There was no reason for you to listen to you.
[14661.91s -> 14666.55s]  Everybody gets so... why did you not listen to chat? Oh, now I'm all fucking tilted.
[14666.63s -> 14671.59s]  No, no, I'm all fucking tilted. How did... what, what... never mind.
[14673.67s -> 14679.83s]  There's too many coming out here. All right, this is ridiculous. I'm fucked. Holy shit, they're stuck.
[14686.30s -> 14704.81s]  No, blow it up. Hurry. I'm gonna wait till it explodes. I can't, I can't do this kind of shit.
[14705.45s -> 14718.31s]  Why? I'm telling you. I can't... where's the armor? In here? Armor... no, it's not. I think my controls
[14718.31s -> 14751.64s]  ran out of battery. I just pressed jump and it took three seconds to happen. Down blue. There's a key here.
[14752.84s -> 14766.44s]  Um, where's that fire? Should I get that? I think I'm gonna get that. Take a risk. No, don't take any risks.
[14768.44s -> 14789.46s]  Put this on. There's the armor. I got it. Oh, I can break these right with the helmet.
[14789.46s -> 14817.30s]  Oh, two keys. Um, uh, excuse me. Excuse me. That's not fair. That's not fair. Unfair. Spawn.
[14818.10s -> 14854.01s]  Why? Can I do this now? What if I don't have my mount or my helmet? Still... can I still beat it?
[14854.01s -> 14876.73s]  P? I think I just got stuck. No, I didn't. Okay. I can't move. I thought that was fire. I was about
[14876.73s -> 14899.61s]  to fucking scream. Anything over here? There's this guy. I have the P. Uh, get away from me.
[14899.61s -> 14909.34s]  Get away from me. Um, what am I? What should I do? What should I do with the P? I don't know
[14909.34s -> 14940.17s]  what to do with the P. Can I fly with the P? You piece of shit. Um, I got it. Fall. Please fall, right?
[14940.17s -> 14957.56s]  No. Okay, I got all three keys. I got the key and now I... what should I do with the block? Why is
[14957.56s -> 15005.83s]  I stuck to the ceiling? Um, wow. Oh my god. I just fucking panicked. Like the ultimate panic. Did I
[15005.83s -> 15047.32s]  get it? Okay, I need to stop. Stop, please. That was fun. That was a fun one. That was nice. That was
[15047.32s -> 15053.58s]  good. That was interesting. Except for like that, you know, spawning... bomb spawning. I mean,
[15053.58s -> 15056.14s]  I don't know. I kind of got killed. I didn't feel like I deserved that.
[15056.94s -> 15084.86s]  You are great at Mario and you are very tall. Hey, gonna have to give it to that one. I like it when
[15084.86s -> 15096.90s]  he gets mad. Escape the swamps while avoiding the hungry piranha plants. Too bad you're not
[15096.90s -> 15114.01s]  great at Mario. It's alright. That's fine. We already got over our leg meltdown. Oh no, we
[15114.01s -> 15137.54s]  didn't. Never mind. Avoid the piranha plants. It's like a pretty wholesome level, right?
[15166.52s -> 15172.73s]  Wait, what's down here? Secret? No, I screwed it up.
[15172.73s -> 15205.38s]  It's to make a Mario. Take a while. That was fun. That was a good one. Thank you for that
[15205.38s -> 15223.59s]  level. It was good. Play this one for the joke. For the jokes, okay. All right. After this,
[15223.59s -> 15227.03s]  can somebody link me one of those that you stand still and it plays a song?
[15233.43s -> 15238.79s]  Can somebody link me? It's got to be the Game of Thrones theme. I want to see that. It has to
[15238.79s -> 15266.73s]  exist. Morality based. What is this? Yoshi's Choice? Question mark. What am I doing here?
[15283.58s -> 15316.04s]  Well, that's interesting. Five seconds. Hold on. I can do that in five seconds.
[15316.04s -> 15358.09s]  I can do that shit in five seconds. How long was that? How on earth do you do that quicker?
[15358.09s -> 15388.04s]  No, I'm done. I'm just gonna do the level. So you gotta fall down and then I'll try it.
[15388.76s -> 15450.81s]  I need Yoshi again. That's longer than I thought. One more try. Oops-a-daisy. Oops-a-daisy. All right,
[15450.81s -> 15467.16s]  that was fun. Next, coming up. I'll try the tuna and pretzel connection that you've been preaching
[15467.16s -> 15501.37s]  to us if you play my level. Yeah. No, you're just spelling up pretending. I get it. Okay,
[15501.37s -> 15516.30s]  can we get a real one or what? Isn't this one real? Hey, regardless, you better try that
[15516.30s -> 15534.58s]  combination. I remember your name. I will remember. This is for me. Actually, for Jermo.
[15534.58s -> 15567.86s]  This should be challenging enough. I regret putting this one in. You can't get more than one
[15567.86s -> 15622.30s]  second. How? One bounce on the head? Right, that's gotta be it. Are you doing this right now at the
[15622.30s -> 15642.20s]  same time? One... I don't... That's... You can't go faster than that. It's not possible. Okay, okay,
[15646.52s -> 15661.24s]  okay. I'm done. I don't care. It was... No, it's 1.3370. Nobody can get faster than that. All right,
[15661.24s -> 15693.24s]  give me another one. This is a relaxing trip to Chill Peak. Don't mind if I do. Chill Peak
[15693.24s -> 15713.24s]  Mountain. Have a relaxing vacation at beautiful Chill Peak Mountain. Mario 3. I already like it.
[15720.18s -> 15751.19s]  This song is freaking me out because it doesn't belong here. Pretty chill. This is from... What
[15751.19s -> 15765.40s]  is this? Rainbow Road? No, no, no. The one where you're... The slide? That's the slide. Right, right,
[15765.40s -> 15779.35s]  right. Or what I think would be better use of this music is a non-stop gif of a hamster running in
[15779.35s -> 15806.73s]  a wheel. Video idea for some of you that have hamsters? No, I gotta fly. There's gotta be
[15806.73s -> 15831.66s]  something over there. Come on, you gotta have something over there. That was... That was a chill,
[15831.66s -> 15858.81s]  fun level. Thank you, that level. All right, just because you wrote, try it out. My very funny
[15858.81s -> 15887.16s]  level and you put ha ha ha ha ha ha in all caps. I had a great a different description but forgot.
[15887.16s -> 15903.37s]  Version 3. This is a 3% level. Reach the goal after activating all 999
[15903.93s -> 15927.51s]  POW blocks. Did this take like six years to make this? The world record is an hour.
[15928.15s -> 15965.77s]  How the fuck do I get out of here? What is happening? What am I doing wrong? Oh, all right, then...
[15966.49s -> 15969.69s]  But I can't get... I can't do anything about that.
[15996.34s -> 15999.14s]  But what? What the fuck? How do I get this thing?
[16001.22s -> 16021.67s]  Okay, low battery. Oh no, what do you mean low battery? I charge these all night.
[16023.67s -> 16033.26s]  Low battery, what? I'm gonna have to bring the dock. No, anyway, I can't. Hold on.
[16033.42s -> 16061.94s]  Hold on. This thing is a lot of the way. Go here. I don't know what that...
[16086.34s -> 16089.94s]  You're probably wondering why I did... I'm just trying to run... I got like a hundred keys.
[16092.34s -> 16094.82s]  I ran back and forth once and I got a bunch of keys, so I'm...
[16106.49s -> 16110.17s]  Oh my god. Okay, why is it giving... What's with all the keys?
[16111.13s -> 16127.05s]  Pretend it's not. It's called experimentation. I don't get it. I'm gonna come back. That just gives me...
[16128.65s -> 16142.09s]  I don't even... I can't even talk. Can you hear this? Huh? Uh, thanks for the five community subs.
[16142.73s -> 16151.05s]  That was for he to meet. Thank you, subs. Five. Appreciate it. Thanks for the five community subs.
[16151.77s -> 16158.65s]  So, I don't understand this.
[16161.21s -> 16168.17s]  What's the time frame on that? You just have to wait like eight, five seconds? Um, all right.
[16189.50s -> 16207.74s]  I don't know. No! Kill me quick! Skip this. I... Hold on. Just let me... Just give me a minute.
[16208.86s -> 16212.20s]  I'm not ready to give up yet. Let me skip to the end of that thing.
[16213.08s -> 16219.62s]  Okay. So, it's like...
[16224.10s -> 16243.10s]  What's happening here? Should I go...
[16251.67s -> 16258.81s]  Was there a spike? Did I just sit on a spike? What? Was there a spike in...
[16266.04s -> 16272.44s]  Yeah, I don't know about this one. I mean, it's funny, but I don't know if I'm gonna sit here all night.
[16273.32s -> 16293.53s]  Okay, deal. Just in here. And then, uh, should I try...
[16296.17s -> 16305.24s]  There goes a hamster! Somebody get a gif of a hamster running away.
[16305.80s -> 16322.63s]  Please. I need to see it. I gotta see if my viral video is gonna take off or not.
[16323.27s -> 16342.54s]  You guys tell me. Do you really care about this level? Hold on. It's paused. Don't worry.
[16352.18s -> 16366.52s]  That's funny. That's funny. Yeah, this is funny. The world record is actually an hour long. How do
[16366.52s -> 16391.45s]  you do this for an hour? No, it's gotta be faster than that. Faster! I need a faster run. I don't...
[16391.45s -> 16402.92s]  I just want to see what this looks like. I need to know. You know, the hamster has to be running,
[16402.92s -> 16415.16s]  like, really fast. No, there's none of these that are that fast. They're slow. Does anybody
[16415.16s -> 16453.45s]  have a fast one? Is this fast? Speed up the video on YouTube. Oh, here we go. No, this is...
[16453.45s -> 16466.25s]  Yeah, this is perfect. This is absolutely perfect. Good. All right, let's do it. This is a good break.
[16466.25s -> 16489.58s]  I'm taking a break. Let's go. And now, damn... 20 kids at the aquarium. Okay, here we go.
[16489.58s -> 16515.94s]  Here we go! That was really cute. That was a very cute video. I would share that on Facebook.
[16516.58s -> 16555.96s]  That's because I'm looking over here and people are, like, fucking furious with that.
[16557.96s -> 16563.56s]  People, like, talking so much shit about that hamster. Oh, I couldn't handle it. I'm sorry.
[16564.60s -> 16571.64s]  I think people are fucking losing their mind about how much they hate the hamster. I don't know.
[16573.40s -> 16585.98s]  My fucking grandmother was like this. It sucked. Oh my god. Every time I hear this, it sucks.
[16587.90s -> 16596.26s]  Oh, this is dumb. That's dumb. Okay, I'm gonna tell you that's dumb. I don't want to do this one
[16596.26s -> 16611.50s]  anymore. That's dumb. That's just dumb. I don't want to do that. I got it. I turned it down.
[16621.10s -> 16629.78s]  Oh, you guys are fucking hilarious. You're giving up on a minute-long level. This is not a minute-long
[16629.78s -> 16655.88s]  level. Okay, do it, pow, and then go right in the door. Go! What? Where's the trick? There's a trick
[16655.88s -> 16666.87s]  somewhere. Where's the trick? There was a trick that I was in. I got hit by the trick already.
[16668.14s -> 16681.51s]  This is the trick. Yes, it is. You're right. I got tricked. All right, this is the last attempt
[16681.51s -> 16705.72s]  and then I'm out. We'll do another one. I'm stuck right now. You know what I mean? I'm fucking stuck.
[16706.04s -> 16727.32s]  Okay, so I go up into here and then what? Does it not go in there? Did I do it? Okay, apparently
[16727.32s -> 16731.24s]  I just hold on. Okay, I held on to the wall. Now what? I'm gonna get crushed. There's somebody in
[16731.24s -> 16764.49s]  there. How do I? No, that's a joke. I can't get that. How am I supposed to get that? I'm going
[16764.49s -> 16777.54s]  to take the damage. Won't I take the damage from the... Do I have to grab that from the very bottom
[16777.54s -> 16785.56s]  pixel? All right, this is my actual final attempt. I promise. I swear this is the final attempt.
[16786.20s -> 16814.95s]  I want to see what happens there. Yeah, I'm curious. All right, let's do this again.
[16816.84s -> 16827.35s]  Hold on to the side. There we go. All right, so how do I get this? Just by jumping up and...
[16828.31s -> 16852.55s]  No, I can't go this way. Oh, come on. No, that's... Why? No, that's not fair. All right, I...
[16854.55s -> 16871.10s]  I know that's the last one, but that wasn't my fault. I know that was not my fault. That was not
[16871.10s -> 16877.98s]  even my last attempt. That was the game... You know what I'm saying? That was not a real attempt.
[16878.94s -> 16885.72s]  If I died by... Oh, I got hit by a spike! Okay, that's me. I didn't lose to that. The game lost
[16885.72s -> 16893.03s]  for me. Like, if I fell down right there, that's an attempt. If I get hit in the head by a wrench
[16893.03s -> 16915.59s]  or something, whatever, that's my fault. Okay, here we go. I know there's a little battery.
[16919.10s -> 16927.03s]  All right, break the blocks and then... Now what? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16927.91s -> 16947.37s]  What happens now? Huh? No, you saw... Break the... Why didn't I shrink? Break the one on the left,
[16947.37s -> 16953.74s]  somebody said, and then I freaked out. That one doesn't count. That was... Somebody in chat died
[16953.74s -> 16957.64s]  there. Not me. Somebody said, break the one on the left, break the one on the left. No, no, that
[16957.64s -> 16960.76s]  wasn't... That was somebody in chat that did that. I didn't do that. That was not something I was
[16960.76s -> 16976.22s]  gonna do. No, that was not me doing that. Hey, hit the one on the left! And I was like, okay,
[16976.22s -> 16993.54s]  this is your turn, so you do it. Nobody told you to follow his advice. No, but still...
[16995.45s -> 17003.75s]  Okay, this is it. This is op... This is on my own. Whatever I do here, this is my doing.
[17004.39s -> 17062.34s]  No one else is going to do this for me. This is my doing. All right, all right. All right, okay.
[17063.82s -> 17072.81s]  Joel just came in with a raid. What's up, Joel? I tried your level and I didn't do very well. It
[17072.81s -> 17080.57s]  was very, very hard. It was super ridiculously hard, but it was very fun, very well thought out.
[17080.57s -> 17088.28s]  I heard it took you 20 hours. I watched the part where you went all the way down and around and
[17088.28s -> 17095.50s]  died at the end, and I vicariously lived through like 12 hours of your life and decided I wasn't
[17095.50s -> 17106.02s]  gonna do it. But welcome, everybody. We're doing just random viewer levels. He said it was a pile
[17106.02s -> 17116.55s]  of shit. I did not... I did not say that. Don't listen to that. All right, how about this one?
[17116.55s -> 17121.82s]  But thank you so much for the raid. If you stick around, we're gonna do this for a little bit
[17121.82s -> 17126.97s]  while longer. Probably another couple hours or something. All right, prove that you're a gamer
[17126.97s -> 17135.67s]  and beat this level. I'll try. Is this one of those levels that laughs at you and makes you
[17135.67s -> 17162.86s]  stuck somewhere? 20 seconds? Megalovania. All right, let's go. Speedrun? It's a... oh, it's a song.
[17163.42s -> 17173.50s]  How has only one percent seen a song get done? Oh, by the way, if you've never seen... if you've
[17173.50s -> 17197.91s]  never seen Undertale, don't look. Spall the coins. Only 19 more seconds. That's right.
[17211.06s -> 17216.42s]  I was running. What? Stop, there are spoilers everywhere.
[17216.90s -> 17240.55s]  What? Now what? Oh god, I have to go up and around. Oh. Oh! What do you do here? You idiot.
[17240.55s -> 17264.46s]  You idiot. You idiot. I at least want to hear the first part of the song.
[17266.46s -> 17310.04s]  Whoa! Spin jump. Spin jump. That was close. Oh! It hit me in the fucking face! What was the point
[17310.04s -> 17334.20s]  of you... should I hold on to that? Ah! Ah! Ah! It actually came down and hit me.
[17334.20s -> 17339.14s]  And hit me. I don't... why am I bringing it? I don't even need to bring that stupid thing.
[17339.14s -> 17387.61s]  Oh my god, I'm an idiot. I did it again. Does... what happened?
[17396.23s -> 17427.85s]  What happened? I... maybe... I gotta see that end. Shoot it? I have to spin jump down there? I only
[17427.85s -> 17465.70s]  have one second remaining. Oh sh... um, I need to know what... I hit the POW when they were on the
[17465.78s -> 17470.58s]  screen. They were clearly on that screen. They were on that screen. You saw them. What happened
[17470.58s -> 17493.96s]  there? I can still do it. All right, so I hit the POW but it didn't kill them down there.
[17493.96s -> 17525.62s]  Doesn't it really blow up everything? Not fast enough. It's the time. Oh man. That was bullshit.
[17525.62s -> 17541.58s]  I got like stuck in the goddamn wall. I'll get it. How did I not touch those? I'm clearly touching
[17542.46s -> 17564.92s]  them. I don't... I'm upset about that. We're back in time again. Dead. I just hit myself in the face.
[17566.76s -> 17570.52s]  Don't jump. I have to like keep moving and I have to hold up and I have to...
[17590.39s -> 17595.27s]  It's right here. I crouched for a tenth of a second. It was like...
[17596.23s -> 17689.21s]  That's all right. Jesus! It's right there. I can smell it. Touch it! Oh, that sucked.
[17689.21s -> 17709.02s]  That sucked. That was that sucked. That's unfortunate. Come on. Move, move, move, move.
[17712.09s -> 17730.63s]  Touch it! I did it! That one was fun. I think I actually had to ground pound. That was pretty
[17730.63s -> 17747.67s]  good. There you go. Prove you're a true gamer. I'm... sometimes I'm a gamer. Not all the time,
[17747.67s -> 17785.90s]  though. All right. This one says, I swear to the Lord. Let's try this one. Plinko shell drop.
[17785.90s -> 17793.88s]  Drop the shell in a slot and see if you can get the jackpot. I feel like I'm going to really like
[17793.88s -> 17810.82s]  this one. I am. Get 60 coins. Reach the goal of grabbing 60 coins. Easy enough, I guess.
[17812.34s -> 17816.26s]  Does it matter which one of these I pick? I know I got low battery.
[17816.42s -> 17861.69s]  I know where it goes. Is this like the dev door? No. All right. I have to follow it.
[17862.65s -> 17876.02s]  I just have to see what I get. I guess I could float down with it, but then I have to come back
[17876.02s -> 17924.57s]  up. Give me 50 coins right now. Right at the bottom. 50. 50! 50! 50! No! What's the point
[17924.57s -> 17961.32s]  of having Yoshi? What does Yoshi do here? It's cute. Yeah, but... No! Oh, shit. I'm gonna do it
[17961.32s -> 17981.69s]  again. We're at the bottom. Wait, you want me to swim all the way down there? All right,
[17981.69s -> 18001.59s]  we're gonna go second here. Right, the door means elevator up. Yes. Yeah. Where did that just go?
[18002.55s -> 18007.69s]  That would make sense, wouldn't it? There would be a door here.
[18008.33s -> 18018.18s]  You're right. Come on, give me the big 50. Why do they all keep going over here?
[18039.99s -> 18044.87s]  Come on, I want to have him go down. No! I want to... Come on, go get him.
[18046.55s -> 18052.94s]  It was gonna work, too. It was gonna work! And now he has the thing in his mouth!
[18053.82s -> 18059.16s]  Despawn. I promised I wasn't gonna scream anymore, and I just did.
[18060.12s -> 18090.02s]  I was trying to drop him down, so maybe he would just float all the way down and grab the 50.
[18090.02s -> 18125.27s]  You're not actually doing this, are you? I thought I was gonna get stuck again. It is.
[18126.47s -> 18132.46s]  No, it's not. Thank God. Don't do it again. Don't do it again. It's gonna do it again.
[18135.22s -> 18142.22s]  Thank God. Come on. I'm almost done. Give me the 50. It's what Yoshi would have wanted.
[18149.62s -> 18188.20s]  50! 50! Yeah! Get the hell out of here. I win. That was a fun one. I liked it. It was fun.
[18202.78s -> 18223.19s]  We got a Life is Pain. I'll give it a try. LPM. What else we got? 1VG. Life is Pain.
[18225.29s -> 18230.33s]  Why did I pick the one that said Life is Pain? The level can only be beaten by sliding backwards.
[18230.97s -> 18290.94s]  Okay. The frozen backwards only cave. I thought I had to slide backward. Can you jump? No.
[18302.18s -> 18314.42s]  Ignore the level name and just go. All right. Fine. You can't walk. You have to go backwards.
[18314.42s -> 18337.64s]  That's what the thing says. I'm losing momentum! I know. I'm sorry. Every time I get really intense,
[18337.64s -> 18372.66s]  it sounds like somebody punching me in the stomach. I'm sorry. Walk to the left. Somebody
[18372.66s -> 18413.38s]  said keep jumping to do momentum. Right here. What if I turn a little... No. Come on. I'm not
[18413.38s -> 18431.06s]  good at it. I'm not. This is Super Mario Wii 3D. This is never gonna happen. What the fuck? Okay.
[18431.06s -> 18488.41s]  Hold on. No. Almost there. No. Do it again. I keep hitting down. It's just in my brain
[18488.41s -> 18492.84s]  because it's slide. You have to slide. Doesn't that mean you have to hold down?
[18492.84s -> 18525.40s]  Like slide backwards to win. Oops. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'll do it. I got it.
[18525.40s -> 18551.05s]  I lost it already, I think. I just had to do it earlier. It's all right. It's not that bad.
[18564.31s -> 18575.40s]  I fucked it up again. You gotta go longer with the slide. Stay in thing with this.
[18575.40s -> 18597.77s]  You gotta do longer. I still get it. You don't have to jump into sliding when I stop moving.
[18597.77s -> 18633.05s]  It's all right. No. It's not all right. See? I keep having problems with that first slide.
[18633.77s -> 18654.46s]  It's okay. The game didn't fuck up yet. Cheater. No. It actually was bad because it stopped me.
[18655.50s -> 18669.75s]  Okay. Here it is. Here it is. Here it is. Here it is. This is the part. All right. All right.
[18669.75s -> 18684.10s]  No. You motherfucker. It's right there. That was it too. Shit.
[18695.40s -> 18718.66s]  This is so addicting, but it's gonna kill me. Stupid fucking low battery.
[18719.62s -> 18723.78s]  I don't care if it's low battery. Stop telling me. You told me like 10 times.
[18723.78s -> 18728.36s]  I don't need you to distract me. I know the battery's low. I know. You don't have to tell
[18728.36s -> 18772.31s]  me every five minutes. I promise. I know. I'm telling you. Humanity is gonna get to a point
[18773.37s -> 18777.61s]  where like this is not gonna be enough. We're gonna start slapping each other in the faces with
[18777.61s -> 18792.09s]  fucking frying pans in like 20 years. This is not gonna be enough. This is gonna be frying pan
[18792.09s -> 18796.49s]  streams where like I hit you in the face with a frying pan and you hit me in the face with a
[18796.49s -> 18814.12s]  fucking frying pan. It's not enough anymore. What happened there? What? I just stopped like
[18814.12s -> 18835.42s]  dead in my tracks. That was weird. It's so fucking much for my body and brain to do this a million
[18835.42s -> 18843.91s]  times. And it's with my least favorite Pokemon too. It's with my least favorite Mario game.
[18843.91s -> 18876.09s]  What is it doing that? Why is it freezing me? That's the second time that's happened. Am I
[18876.09s -> 18897.96s]  doing something wrong here? I don't understand it. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I got it. I did it. Oh
[18897.96s -> 18906.92s]  my god. I did it. Yes. Wait. Hold on. What do I do now? Can I not touch that? I can touch that,
[18906.92s -> 18949.83s]  right? What does that mean? You fuck. That was unfortunate. I just heard the laugh. It means I
[18949.83s -> 19002.30s]  can't do it. I heard like the fucking cat noise. That was genuine. It eats away at my fucking soul.
[19010.09s -> 19018.20s]  Oh, I'm going too fast. No, I gotta slow down. So I'm so glad I did the beginning again though.
[19020.23s -> 19037.24s]  So I'm not sliding bad. Then I'm not sliding forwards. I mean backwards, I mean. That's not
[19037.24s -> 19058.94s]  gonna be like deduct points or something, right? How do I open this door? How do I open the door?
[19058.94s -> 19093.32s]  Just walk. Just walk. Just walk. Just walk. I did it. Wait. Does this matter? This doesn't fucking
[19093.32s -> 19121.66s]  matter. 39 seconds. That was crazy. He has a calming level. Oh, that's funny. Jubated. I like it.
[19121.66s -> 19130.38s]  I made this fun. Let's try it. What was the completion on this? 2%. That was fun.
[19139.48s -> 19154.78s]  PNM. 8. TG. I made this one. Four cast calls with lots of fish bones. Left, right, left. When does
[19154.78s -> 19198.42s]  it end? Short and sweet. Fish bone barrage. I know how to do this. I can't do this in like
[19199.54s -> 19211.86s]  hot dog mode. You can't play Mario Maker in hot dog mode. All right, hold on. No, I got it. I got
[19211.86s -> 19218.57s]  it. I got it. Don't worry. I'm fine. I'm gonna charge these up. Hold on a sec. Just wait.
[19218.57s -> 19441.42s]  All right. Take a pee break. I'll be right back. I got controllers here. I'm good. All right. I'm
[19441.42s -> 19453.56s]  good to go. It's starting to communicate. Yeah, I'm good. I'm ready. Okay. Was I on a level?
[19454.20s -> 19464.34s]  I think I was, right? Fish bone barrage. Well, there goes a CD. I don't know what the fuck it was.
[19470.86s -> 19497.02s]  All right. I think that's a joke. I can't get them. Maybe I can. Will those kill me if they touch me?
[19497.02s -> 19505.46s]  Probably, right? Where's like the indicator of where they land? It's like a telegraph.
[19508.25s -> 19517.14s]  Dear, what are they gonna fall? It just takes up the screen. Left, right, left, right, left, right.
[19517.14s -> 19530.63s]  Okay. Left, right. Oh, I get it. All right. That's a neat little, uh, that was right. So, they're
[19530.63s -> 19539.67s]  gonna go left side now. Two, three, left. They're gonna be on the right side. And that's the thing
[19539.67s -> 19560.46s]  that kills me. I'm looking up. So, when you're here, that's right. Because that's, now that's left.
[19562.18s -> 19579.69s]  The beeps are left and the errors are right. Hang on. Oh, shit. Not good. It's gonna be left,
[19579.69s -> 19594.31s]  isn't it? That was, that was a different beep than the other ones were, right? I thought that was
[19594.31s -> 19607.51s]  going right. Because that really looks like this one. This one goes boop. See? I, I'm not sure the
[19607.51s -> 19631.93s]  sounds matter. I think it just goes left, right, left, right. Hurry, hurry up. But, oh, shit. No,
[19631.93s -> 19656.06s]  please. I tried to aim it. I tried to block it. No, it's gonna be on the left. Shit. Oh, boy.
[19658.74s -> 19669.80s]  I thought, I don't know if we, at first, I had a little bit more time, I guess. I thought I had
[19669.80s -> 19686.10s]  way less time. What the fuck? Oh, fuck. I gotta go this way. Because that's not gonna be over.
[19687.58s -> 19704.46s]  No. Come on. I gotta stand underneath it. Which way is it gonna go? Oh, man. You have to jump
[19704.46s -> 19717.91s]  right underneath when I go. Damn it. All right. I thought, it spawned me, like, right in the thing.
[19719.99s -> 19726.81s]  I feel like it takes me two or three times to do that every single time.
[19728.33s -> 19758.15s]  I'm holding B. It just doesn't go up. Why? Shit. Okay. Block it. Block it. Please.
[19758.71s -> 19772.84s]  All right. I gotta make the jump up right before they land. Now what? All the way to the right?
[19774.12s -> 19812.04s]  Anything else to block? Oh, God. Just go in. Just go in. Get out of here. There it is. That's not
[19812.04s -> 19822.86s]  gonna, was that gonna kill me? I thought I was gonna die. That was a really good one. Cheers to
[19822.86s -> 19834.89s]  that. How do I, what do I, I can't like it. Oops. All right. We'll try this one. This one
[19834.89s -> 19860.02s]  requires no gamer skills. And I like the sound of that. MBG4C6TWG. What does that say? Wait,
[19860.02s -> 19889.85s]  did I get that wrong? B. Wait, what? I read MBG4C6TWG. MBG4C6TWG. That didn't work. MBG4C6TWG.
[19890.17s -> 19914.47s]  Yeah. Weird. All right. We'll do this one. 5TV. It's MGB not, it's MGB not MGB.
[19915.43s -> 19921.58s]  You're confusing the absolute fuck out of me right now. All right. Mario in the haunted treasure.
[19925.80s -> 19928.84s]  Mario discovers a cave full of gold, but he needs a P-switch to reach it.
[19929.72s -> 19956.34s]  Is it a storyline one? I probably shouldn't have done that. Okay. Hold on. Let me look.
[19957.06s -> 19966.92s]  Uh, what's down here? Oh, I just dropped the big one.
[19971.94s -> 19975.30s]  Oh, I should not have done that. I should not have done that.
[19977.50s -> 19990.86s]  Is this a new motorcycle ride fun? Did I ride it yet? I'm just gonna go through here.
[19991.50s -> 20017.53s]  Well, that was bad. It's good. All right. Um, I think I have to go down here. Really?
[20017.53s -> 20024.44s]  Yeah. The Hagrid out of the new universal ride. Yeah. I'm surprised more people didn't know what
[20024.44s -> 20060.46s]  I was talking about. I got a one-up on it. I got the P-block. I did it, right? That's it. What am
[20060.46s -> 20097.58s]  I standing still for? I feel like I'm doing like the secret. I feel like I'm doing the secret part.
[20097.58s -> 20159.94s]  Uh-oh. He shook me. Should I just bring this with me? All right. I did it. Oh shit. I did it.
[20159.94s -> 20178.18s]  All right. I feel like there was a few ways to go there. Short and sweet. That was pretty short.
[20182.09s -> 20198.25s]  All right. We got this one. Here's the correct spelling. M-G-B-4-C-6. M-G-B-4-C-6-T-W-G.
[20203.37s -> 20208.84s]  There we go. Okay. Bob-omb mansion. Short and sweet. This one is pretty explosive.
[20209.56s -> 20234.14s]  Let's take a look. First day of work and I dropped the vase on the ground.
[20234.14s -> 20249.19s]  Okay. I'm just gonna get over that. Do I need to do something with these?
[20249.83s -> 20252.23s]  I feel like you wouldn't have bombs if I wasn't gonna need to use them.
[20252.39s -> 20289.99s]  I can't fucking believe I missed that jump. That's one way to do it. Wait.
[20304.86s -> 20324.92s]  Ah. Oh yeah. I didn't see the other one. No. The chomp did it. I didn't see it. That's good.
[20325.56s -> 20330.65s]  This is a pretty good placement of the, uh, of the Bob-ombs, I will say.
[20331.29s -> 20347.53s]  They kind of just, they just barely get right in the way. Pretty good. Almost fucking blew that one.
[20348.41s -> 20378.95s]  All right. Hold on. Upside down P. Hit it. I knew I was gonna need this. Y'all thought I
[20378.95s -> 20384.65s]  wasn't gonna need that and I, I brought, I got it. Now I got Yoshi. What do I do with Yoshi now?
[20384.65s -> 20423.82s]  Uh, melt. All right. Hold on here. Checkpoint. Nice. I do have to say, I don't want to lose
[20423.82s -> 20435.13s]  Yoshi though because I'm not gonna get him at the checkpoint. Uh, I was off screen, so.
[20437.88s -> 20443.27s]  It's all right. I got an extra, I get to take an extra hit. Let me see what this looks like. Hold
[20443.27s -> 20470.22s]  on. Shit. Go. Damage boost. Oh my god. It's the end. I win. Clever. Clever. That's pretty good.
[20470.22s -> 20484.82s]  Bob-omb mansion. Very cool. Thank you. This one is, uh, the man on a mission, the level, the movie.
[20485.70s -> 20505.48s]  This is piquing my curiosity. Let's see what this does. The level, the movie. KMG. Mario goes to the
[20505.48s -> 20525.78s]  store for milk. All right. Uh, sorry. A zeppelin just flew by. All right. Uh, go to the store and
[20525.78s -> 20543.11s]  get the milk. Reached the goal after defeating all the booms. What the absolute fuck is that?
[20553.03s -> 20600.65s]  Oh, that's not good. How do I break the ice? Let's go. I'm going real fast. Can you actually
[20600.65s -> 20631.13s]  crash the car and die? It's too soft. I can't. What else you got? Let's go. This level made me cry
[20631.13s -> 20652.31s]  tears of joy. I'll check it out. Thank you for the level, by the way. Escape from Peerthorn
[20652.31s -> 20655.91s]  Perch. Can you escape the tricky jungle of spiky peerthorn trees? Water is rising.
[20656.87s -> 20673.86s]  Okay. Let's go. Try again. Remember we were talking about how, like, uh, did I say something
[20673.86s -> 20679.35s]  earlier about, like, a pizza? I said earlier that I was gonna eat, like, a large pizza or something,
[20679.35s -> 20723.85s]  didn't I? Um, did the guys have to get all the coins? I'm not, I'm not gonna make this. I didn't even try.
[20730.86s -> 20733.58s]  I'm not gonna eat a chicken on stream again. That's not gonna be the thing.
[20734.38s -> 20750.30s]  Is the audio a bit early? Yeah, I don't know why. Especially the switch for some reason
[20750.94s -> 20755.50s]  when I pull through this capture card. Is that a sink? I think it happens sometimes with other
[20755.50s -> 20761.82s]  ones too, but not. I feel like it's a switch thing. At least on my whatever I have for a setup here.
[20771.06s -> 20781.34s]  No. Any other compulsive jumpers in Mario? Like, I jump. I land on a surface. Jump. Okay.
[20782.22s -> 20793.54s]  I'm a compulsive jumper. I need to hit a blue switch somewhere.
[20794.10s -> 20816.04s]  Looks like it's over here. There it is. Let's kind of shoot out of there. Shell. But why
[20816.92s -> 20818.92s]  do I need a shell? I guess I could go like this.
[20823.19s -> 20826.63s]  Anybody else here an idiot too? No, just me. Get out of here. Give me a break.
[20827.35s -> 20835.72s]  Get out of here. Get out of here with that shit. Come on. Get out of here. Like, come on. Really?
[20865.59s -> 20884.62s]  I don't want to kill this because I don't know what's in that box. What was the point of that?
[20884.62s -> 20888.86s]  Get back up there quickly, I guess, to hit the switch. Really? Why did you turn so rapidly?
[20889.98s -> 20915.29s]  Did I pick? I got that one already. That's odd. Okay. I don't know if I'll get it. Three more?
[20916.17s -> 20952.04s]  There's one in there. Load that up. Oh, shit. Oh, no. Now they're gonna get down here. What have I
[20952.04s -> 20980.79s]  done? Well, they're in a nice place. Supposed to do that. Switch is over here. I think now I can
[20981.59s -> 21008.78s]  do this. No. I have to go. It's got to bounce off that. Did I screw the whole thing up? You
[21008.78s -> 21024.79s]  would think it would bounce across, right? I guess I'm just gonna stand down there and do it again.
[21024.79s -> 21061.75s]  What does that achieve for me? What do I just do? Can I jump up here?
[21063.83s -> 21067.05s]  Oh, I can go through this wood. Right, right. Then,
[21067.77s -> 21090.06s]  hold on. Anything change up here? There we go. All right. Two more. I'm thinking I'm thinking
[21090.06s -> 21101.21s]  jump and grab and fall and grab and hold and... Okay. Do I need to blow that up with a bomb?
[21101.93s -> 21117.24s]  Can you... Can I swim? Or am I gonna sink right to the bottom? I don't remember. Okay. I think
[21117.24s -> 21140.23s]  sometimes I forget. All right. On this side? Okay. There's this shit. So that wall is gone.
[21143.54s -> 21157.29s]  What are you gonna fire? Oh, it's a homing missile. Oh, fuck. I'm fine. All right. One more.
[21157.85s -> 21166.04s]  And where is this last one? What's down here? Can I see anything? All right. What is this?
[21167.48s -> 21175.21s]  It's not... All right. Just swim. Just swim. Just swim. Swim. Swim. Swim. Swim. Swim. There's
[21175.21s -> 21218.31s]  one more somewhere. Where's this last one? Uh-oh. Red platform writer. What is this? Go in? What's
[21218.31s -> 21227.46s]  it gonna drop? A bomb. But what do I do with the bomb? I don't have the key. Left. Left. Go left.
[21231.94s -> 21234.98s]  All right. Then I gotta... All right. I'm good. I'm gonna go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
[21234.98s -> 21240.46s]  I get it. Okay. I gotta go down. Take a bomb down. But right down? Straight down?
[21241.10s -> 21254.52s]  This is it. Holy shit. It's already open. I did it already. Nice. Now I got a power block
[21256.44s -> 21262.76s]  and I need to do something with this. What do I need to do with this? What do I do with this?
[21263.56s -> 21266.92s]  I don't know what this wants me to do. Um... Do I kill it? Go in the pipe?
[21267.64s -> 21296.22s]  I have... There's another... Holy shit. This is long. Oh, that's not good. I had to bounce and then grab.
[21297.91s -> 21316.04s]  Oh boy. Okay. So I got it. Now it became a speed run. Why did I not throw that earlier?
[21316.04s -> 21338.10s]  That's what I want to know. Okay. Now what? Oh. Spin. I can just throw it anywhere though, so that's
[21338.10s -> 21357.29s]  fine. Does it go in the water? This whole stream, I'll tell you. Take all the audio clips I've said.
[21359.03s -> 21369.67s]  I might as well be watching golf. Oh. Did it go in the water? Oh, it got trapped. I'm just
[21369.67s -> 21392.87s]  watching fucking golf. Really? Come on. That's bullshit. Bounced off one and hit the other.
[21406.58s -> 21425.99s]  I'm safe. Wait a minute. What's... Other keys. Just no other five keys?
[21425.99s -> 21437.99s]  That was good. Watching golf with the occasional jump scare reaction.
[21440.82s -> 21454.10s]  Yeah, that's when the guy accidentally hits it like way too far and it like soars. That's when
[21454.10s -> 21458.82s]  the guy uses like a three wood instead of a pitching wedge and he like hits it like fucking
[21458.82s -> 21490.94s]  over the building. Yeah, totally. No slack at all tonight, huh? Geez. All right. Let's do...
[21492.78s -> 21500.60s]  What about the times when I yell? Well, I'm trying to fuck the guy up that's hitting the ball.
[21501.48s -> 21512.54s]  Right? When he goes down, I go like... Now I get fucking thrown out. All right. Epic cool level.
[21512.54s -> 21550.09s]  Okay. Let's try this one. No, no, no. 50H. What the hell is this? Did I just type in somebody's
[21550.09s -> 21556.09s]  fucking like password? Did I just like get into somebody's account? Was that like your account
[21556.09s -> 21588.23s]  login? Okay. I made this for you. All right. We'll do this one. 13. Why does this one look
[21588.23s -> 21595.08s]  familiar? Did I do this one already? What is that? Of course it looks familiar and it's died to
[21595.08s -> 21633.48s]  pinwheel. Okay. All right. Your skills astound me. Here we go. This one looks normal. This one looks
[21633.48s -> 21663.08s]  normal and not like this. Okay. All right. Try this level. I feel like that one would be fun.
[21663.08s -> 21669.96s]  I feel like 30 or 40 of those, which is those. All right. Wait, wait, wait. Let's do this one.
[21669.96s -> 21695.26s]  This one looks normal. I think this is a normal one. Boing gear tower. All right. This one is real
[21695.26s -> 21715.91s]  and it's also apparently very hard. Solve and scale the highest tower. Sorry. I had to stop.
[21715.91s -> 21727.46s]  All right. Where are we going? Scale the tower. Obviously I have to do that. This looks complicated.
[21727.46s -> 21775.22s]  I might just veto this one. How do I? I think I had to try this one more time.
[21775.22s -> 21780.26s]  Damage run it maybe? Or does it matter which one of these I go into? Or
[21781.22s -> 21799.61s]  probably not. I'm assuming I probably have to damage run this. Let's go. I'm missing something.
[21800.41s -> 21860.46s]  This one is different. I'm way too fast. Fuck. Oh shit. Look out. I'm Zeppelin. I think I got it.
[21860.46s -> 21868.81s]  And then the thing shoots. Ah. It's just a P. It's just a P block. It's not a big deal. Now that'll
[21868.81s -> 21876.30s]  give me the... I have this now. Should I take them both? I can't take them both. All right. Now
[21877.82s -> 21916.15s]  this one... I don't think it's this one. Throw the spring over here. Oh. What happened? Did I do it?
[21917.29s -> 21920.65s]  Oh. Okay. I gotta get them all. All right. No, no, no. All right. So that's that one. Now we
[21920.65s -> 21967.03s]  get to do this one. So now... All right. Get... Bring it. Nothing gonna kill me? How do I get this
[21967.03s -> 22001.50s]  down? So that means should I kill the... No. That was what I just did. I need to throw the bomb.
[22002.46s -> 22019.66s]  I have to keep pushing the thwomp. Yeah. But I mean, how do I do that?
[22020.78s -> 22029.74s]  I was thinking throw a bomb down there. Let me look at this again.
[22033.64s -> 22060.57s]  Okay. Are you serious? That... Do it again. Only two more. If I die, it's over.
[22065.40s -> 22068.44s]  Now this is the one that I was doing... All right. I have no idea how to do this one.
[22070.41s -> 22090.68s]  Get up here. And then somehow I have to hit this. But how do I grab that? Because I can't jump
[22090.68s -> 22138.66s]  through. Will he hit this? I felt like that was pretty good. Okay. So now this is where I can die.
[22138.66s -> 22145.18s]  This is bad. Because I don't have any checkpoints. Is this... It's this or that's it? It's over.
[22146.14s -> 22152.84s]  Do I have to go down? Pull it up. Go down. And then... I don't know. I have no idea how the fuck to
[22152.84s -> 22171.82s]  get over there. I get one shot. Climb up. Climb down. Do I have to make that thing fall? One shot.
[22171.82s -> 22199.80s]  Here we go. What? Did that really just happen? I was... Hold on. I need to see that again.
[22201.21s -> 22206.65s]  That was dog shit. That... Come on. That was not cool. What? I'm actually... I'm pretty mad about
[22206.65s -> 22225.99s]  that. Apparently. I have to stand on that. Yeah. I have to get on... Stand on it. Well, I'm gonna...
[22225.99s -> 22243.21s]  This one's first. The other ones aren't that hard. I'm gonna do it. But then when it comes back,
[22243.21s -> 22255.91s]  what am I supposed to do? Like here. Yeah. You gotta... You gotta go up. You gotta go down. When
[22255.91s -> 22269.46s]  it goes up, you gotta go up. When it goes down, like yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You gotta fit yourself
[22269.46s -> 22283.08s]  in the slot. Whatever one it's currently on. I'm trying to go fast. No. I shouldn't be doing that.
[22294.82s -> 22312.81s]  Hasty. Hasty. Hasty. What the fuck? What? I don't... I don't want to stay on it.
[22317.58s -> 22327.51s]  It's killing me. I have to do this. It's... You got this little tiny margin. Damn it. Damn it.
[22328.31s -> 22359.85s]  Ah. Look how far away I am. What is with that? I'm not even close. All right. Let's go.
[22360.65s -> 22366.63s]  The other ones are not that hard. I should be able to do them without a problem.
[22373.96s -> 22381.85s]  What is this one? I haven't seen this one yet either. Might as well figure out how to do them
[22381.85s -> 22394.28s]  all. All right. So the theory here is to get this down, I have to throw it? Just throw it down there
[22394.28s -> 22406.81s]  and then... But do I jump down with this and then throw it over? How am I supposed to get to the
[22406.81s -> 22431.56s]  right? Then now I can just... No. But how? I gotta go backwards to the blocks. Just drop. Bingo.
[22432.70s -> 22451.34s]  Down deal. Two more. Don't accidentally hit this pipe. This one... I know how to do this one. Right.
[22451.34s -> 22456.86s]  I remember. Yeah. Oh. This one actually... I can die here. This one's kind of wonky. I can die here.
[22457.74s -> 22490.26s]  Give me another one. That was painful. It was. That was painful, but I don't want to do it again.
[22490.98s -> 22495.46s]  It was not that bad. It was good. That level was good. I had it, but I just... I don't want to do...
[22495.46s -> 22514.78s]  Oh. I don't want to do it again. Damn it. That one was fun. I knew that there was a big push there and...
[22516.30s -> 22526.65s]  Let's do this one. What time is it? All right. We'll do a few more in the night. We gotta call it.
[22526.65s -> 22540.66s]  It's getting late. Zero g d. I will be back tomorrow with... That's a good question.
[22545.14s -> 22567.51s]  Meowzer's four challenges. Complete each diverse challenge and race Meowzer to the finish. Guys,
[22567.51s -> 22584.63s]  isn't tomorrow Terraria Day? I'm gonna have to talk to Star. It was supposed to be either
[22585.51s -> 22588.55s]  tomorrow or Saturday or Saturday or depending on what he's doing.
[22589.51s -> 22593.90s]  Maybe it's tomorrow. If he's around tomorrow and wants to do it tomorrow, we'll do it tomorrow.
[22593.90s -> 22607.45s]  There's gotta be a reason for this. Of course there is.
[22611.05s -> 22637.70s]  This is cheating now. He must have watched Evo. Oh, fuck. Evo is this weekend. Oh, no.
[22638.26s -> 22650.33s]  I got too much stuff to do. Oh, no. I wanted to go. It's like right here. I gotta get on a plane
[22650.33s -> 22655.61s]  and like go to this robotics facility. Evo is this weekend. Why is there so much stuff going on?
[22656.57s -> 22683.38s]  Oh, did I get trolled? Was that like a joke? What? What? What happened? Oh, that was in one
[22683.38s -> 22725.35s]  of the trials. I was supposed to go back up. When does Evo... It was ice cubes. I'm dead.
[22726.39s -> 22733.45s]  Starts at 10 a.m. tomorrow. Well, no. I got... I'm not gonna go. I got too much going on.
[22734.97s -> 22763.48s]  It's all weekend? Yeah, but I can't because I'm streaming. I'm gonna be streaming today,
[22763.48s -> 22769.72s]  tomorrow, and the next day. I might be able to pop over there on Sunday, but then next week I'm
[22769.72s -> 22776.49s]  gonna go. I'm going to... I'm going across the country to work on the carnival stream at the
[22776.49s -> 22783.00s]  facility where it's happening. So I don't... Wait, give me the fly. Give me the fly. I'm not just
[22783.00s -> 22793.29s]  gonna not stream. Maybe I'll just go watch the finals. That's a whole separate event, right?
[22793.29s -> 22819.72s]  The finals. Should I stay in the car? I don't know why I'm still in the car. Depends on what
[22819.72s -> 22845.03s]  game. I do need the car. Am I too small to get in there now? Oh, thank God. All right, back out.
[22845.03s -> 22858.33s]  Evo sold out. Oh, well, there you go. Never mind. Scream the finals on your channel like you did
[22858.33s -> 22864.87s]  with E3. I don't... I'm not sure you were allowed to co-stream that. I don't have any idea what the
[22864.87s -> 22870.87s]  hell I'm talking about. I would not be able to commentate like Street Fighter gameplay.
[22870.87s -> 22892.49s]  Okay. No, I wouldn't want to do that. Just let him fall down there and just do it.
[22893.13s -> 22934.41s]  I need that. Two more. Easy. What? No! He was a different... He was a different... I didn't... I
[22934.41s -> 22946.42s]  thought... I thought he took a long time to shoot that. He took... He took his time to shoot that.
[22947.56s -> 22973.80s]  Fuck, that one was fun, too. Tina Belcher? All right, it's almost time to go.
[22976.97s -> 22980.92s]  I feel like I did that a lot today, too. All right, let's do...
[22982.66s -> 22996.65s]  This one's a relaxing level. Who knows if they're alive or not. W-P-T. Y-J-5.
[22999.56s -> 23011.32s]  L-K-G. Seven Heaven. Traverse Bowser Jr.'s fleet. Watch out for the cannonballs.
[23012.28s -> 23029.02s]  Is this Cake Mario? No. This is not Cake Mario. It's not my favorite Mario.
[23031.66s -> 23040.36s]  Got big. It got small. I don't need it. I don't need it for these auto-scrollers.
[23044.57s -> 23067.94s]  No. Fire. Watch out. Got it. This is it. What a nice level. Kind of relaxing and just fun.
[23068.74s -> 23081.58s]  Just jump around and jump on stuff. Watch out for the fire. Get the goombas. I thought that was a
[23081.66s -> 23107.14s]  ground. Where are you going? Guys. Guys. Okay. It might be time for me to pull the plug.
[23111.13s -> 23116.25s]  I don't know what it is. Mario is such like a fun family game. But when I play it,
[23116.97s -> 23165.14s]  I feel like I smoked a pack of cigarettes. That was a good one. Let me try to get a good jump.
[23165.14s -> 23184.07s]  That was a four out of ten. What time is it? We can do two more. Two more. Six and a half hours.
[23184.07s -> 23193.02s]  We're good. We can do like two more. Somebody said here's a baby level. Wait. Hold on. There's
[23193.02s -> 23199.16s]  cool level with wrenches. Let me do this one first. He's addicted. Well, it's kind of just fun to see
[23199.16s -> 23223.70s]  what people make. This one has wrenches. Escaping the P-Mole Fortress. Use their P-Block against
[23223.70s -> 23244.38s]  them. Use the P-Block against them. And it's also got this lava here. That deer right there has
[23244.38s -> 23248.86s]  wrenches in this level. Means it gets an automatic one point letter grade higher. I can't even make
[23248.86s -> 23289.24s]  this jump. I have to stop looking at fucking chat. Oh you guys. What the fuck. All right. Let's go.
[23296.17s -> 23303.98s]  Am I still here? Are you still alive, man? Are you still with me? Am I going to get that smell
[23303.98s -> 23320.26s]  thing that the people put in your nose and makes you go, I'm alive now. It's all about these blocks.
[23321.80s -> 23324.92s]  The car is leaving without me. They're going on vacation without me. I don't even have my fucking
[23324.92s -> 23349.05s]  backpack. That's unbelievable. What happens if they go all the way? Oh. Anybody figure this out?
[23349.77s -> 23380.42s]  Look at all those. Look at all those fucking ribbons. Whatever they are.
[23380.42s -> 23393.00s]  Holy shit. How am I supposed to do that? Oh man. No. Come back. Come back. Where's the switch?
[23393.56s -> 23409.35s]  Oh I have to hit the switch right. Holy shit. I have to just dodge until it gets all the way
[23409.35s -> 23423.14s]  over there. I have to tap it and wait. I have to wait for one pass of ribbons right here. Don't
[23423.14s -> 23432.66s]  go anywhere. Touch it. Now I have to wait. What the. That was impossible. That was an
[23432.66s -> 23438.06s]  uncompletable. That was an uncompletable bow tie pasta right there. I'm sorry.
[23438.06s -> 23455.29s]  Another night. Where was I supposed to go? All right. Come on. One more pass and that's it.
[23455.93s -> 23486.28s]  Oh shit. I need that. That's fire. Give me that. Just damage boost. Oh I fucking panicked.
[23487.00s -> 23505.77s]  I'm so pissed. That's all right. I'm right here. Oh I'm pissed. Pissed. Do you hear that? He's pissed.
[23515.51s -> 23538.63s]  Give me the mushroom. Come on. Get a mushroom out here right now. Please. Oh this. Fire.
[23539.67s -> 23575.85s]  Right. My goodness. I gotta like bait them up. All right. Get this mushroom and then relax.
[23576.57s -> 23584.84s]  Now wait. They throw two. There it is. Wait for the fire. You gotta be kidding me. Get the other
[23584.84s -> 23590.60s]  mushroom right now. Right now. Why did it not come out? Why did that not come out? I don't understand.
[23615.03s -> 23627.05s]  All right. The fire is what's killing me here. I got plenty of time so just hold on. I can't go.
[23627.69s -> 23643.72s]  I think I just tried to snipe me. I tried to jump off of them and for some reason holding B just
[23643.72s -> 23676.15s]  didn't do anything. I was holding the B button down. Come on.
[23689.02s -> 23695.58s]  I don't know. I don't. They're gonna be everywhere now. I'm in so much trouble. Look at this. They're
[23695.58s -> 23711.45s]  everywhere. Look at this. Did you see this? I have to just go fast. You gotta go as fast as you can
[23711.45s -> 23728.09s]  otherwise they just group up on you. Well not that fast. There's no power button or something
[23728.09s -> 23746.62s]  somewhere. I almost got hit by that. All right. Let me take a second before I just... Well you
[23746.62s -> 23755.62s]  have to go fast because the... Wait. Just get... I was gonna wait for the mushroom. You have to... I
[23755.62s -> 23761.14s]  have to stay... I'm gonna stand on the edge after the fire. There's one square you can stand on.
[23763.26s -> 23766.70s]  My stomach doesn't hit the... By the way if you're curious my stomach just fucking pushed
[23766.70s -> 23792.39s]  forward on the desk and hit R. I didn't think it was on there. It's such a bad spot. No. What the
[23792.47s -> 23819.59s]  fuck? Oh my god. Oh my... What the fuck? Throw him up. Yeah. Up here. Throw him. I know you...
[23820.63s -> 23841.99s]  This fire over here is... And now let me get up here. All right. Hold on right here for a second.
[23842.79s -> 23893.08s]  It's gonna hit me. Wow. Huh? You gotta kill... Okay. You kill him. I killed him. Now we just have...
[23893.80s -> 23905.45s]  I think I have to get down there now. Did it... That one was intense.
[23909.50s -> 23914.70s]  That last spot. That last screen with the vines and the wrenches and the explosions and the...
[23915.66s -> 23925.45s]  I don't know if I can do that one again. That was really cool though. All right.
[23927.13s -> 23950.23s]  We're gonna end it on one more. Yeah. Give me like a Game of Thrones theme song. You can search.
[23950.31s -> 23963.69s]  All right. Let me search then. It's not over. It's not over. It's not over. It's not over.
[23963.69s -> 23975.34s]  How am I searching? Difficulty all. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Get detailed search. Music
[23975.34s -> 23987.78s]  by popularity. Game... Okay. Here we go. Game style. All course theme. That doesn't really matter,
[23987.78s -> 24017.74s]  I guess. Is tags music? There we go. Music. Just music. Okay. Did that work? Oh, by popularity.
[24020.60s -> 24028.06s]  Rhythm challenge. This is a gourmet race. Country roads. Okay. I need to know what this one's like.
[24039.26s -> 24070.41s]  Cake Mario is the best one. Take me home country road.
[24086.95s -> 24123.51s]  That was nice. That was really nice. Fucking up the rhythm. Yeah, I know. At least make the tempo
[24123.51s -> 24133.75s]  consistent. I have one piece. This is that one piece theme song. I'm not sure I've ever even
[24133.75s -> 24141.69s]  heard this before. Wait, I have... It goes, give it up, give it up, give it up. Yeah, yo, yeah, yo.
[24141.69s -> 24171.85s]  Are they gonna do that? His name is Luffy. Right? That's not it. No, they've trapped me in here. I
[24171.85s -> 24221.26s]  can't like run out. I can't get out of here. Is that... Okay, so that's season two. Is this season
[24221.26s -> 24239.72s]  three? No. Oh, that's cool. Oh, that's the pirate ship. Wow, that's neat. Yeah. Star Fox.
[24240.97s -> 24274.17s]  Mortal Kombat. Walk, don't run. Don't tell me what to do. Here we go. Test your fight. What is it?
[24274.17s -> 24277.85s]  It's test your what? What is it? Choose to fight. What is it? What's the actual thing?
[24298.79s -> 24326.87s]  Choose to fight. That's really, really cool. Game of Thrones. The Game of Thrones theme song.
[24328.20s -> 24347.06s]  I'm not gonna click that one. I know everyone's supposed to freak the fuck out. Wait, is this
[24347.06s -> 24352.68s]  gonna... I might want to hear that one.
[24367.11s -> 24395.96s]  Maybe that one too. Train your things. Pizza delivery. All-star. Don't move. Don't move? Okay.
[24467.59s -> 24477.94s]  All right. What do you mean ruined it? That was at the very end. 24 seconds. Somebody... I gotta
[24477.94s -> 24503.59s]  get the speed run on this one. How to train your dragon. Tetris. Mario Maker. Wild. Passes. Sky.
[24503.59s -> 24517.11s]  Peaches. Castle. Quarry. Fountain. Wait, is this the like... I kind of have to know this.
[24537.85s -> 24576.82s]  I want to hear it again. I wanted to hear it again. I want to hear it again. That's really cool.
[24577.62s -> 24589.78s]  No, that's too fast. That's way too fast. Don't... I wouldn't run here.
[24591.38s -> 24634.18s]  It's gonna be slower. Maybe not. What song is it backwards? Sounds pretty much the same.
[24637.66s -> 24668.63s]  That goes forward and backwards the same. All right. One more and that's it. We're gonna do one more
[24668.63s -> 24727.30s]  song. Hotel Mario. Wait, is this the one that goes like... It is, isn't it? Yeah, it is. There's more?
[24727.30s -> 24732.90s]  Wait, I actually have to play this... I have to play this level. There's gameplay in this one,
[24732.90s -> 24747.53s]  guys. Pretty cool. And we're having a lot of spaghetti. That's a thing from like 2008.
[24751.90s -> 24778.07s]  That's it? What was that? I grew up on that meme. I think a lot of people did. That was back when
[24778.07s -> 24786.55s]  YouTube... People would just sentence splice together a bunch of dog shit. There were whole
[24786.55s -> 24794.86s]  communities around just like YouTube poops. That was old. All right, we'll do...
[24797.70s -> 24806.28s]  Donkey Kong. That's it. It was an interesting time. Yeah, you never knew what you were gonna get.
[24807.00s -> 24838.98s]  Kong? Donkey Kong. I almost just fell off. Now it's this Donkey Kong. Well, it's not that one,
[24838.98s -> 24879.78s]  is it? Nice. Where's the... That made me go a million miles per hour. That's right there.
[24880.74s -> 24906.87s]  Is it slippery or what? Whoa, these are... That's not in Mario. That's not in Donkey Kong.
[24906.87s -> 24928.74s]  They don't fire laser beams at you from the cannons. They added that in. This is an
[24928.74s -> 24937.58s]  interpretation of what that was. All right, well, hold on a second here. Now...
[24941.90s -> 24963.61s]  Ah, guys. All right, that was fun. This was a very, very fun stream for me. I enjoyed it.
[24963.69s -> 24970.39s]  This game is a lot of fun. I wish I was better at Mario. I wish I was like a better Mario
[24970.39s -> 24984.57s]  player. It's still fun though. So tomorrow... I'm not sure what's gonna happen tomorrow.
[24985.13s -> 25007.38s]  It's either gonna be Terraria with Star or Sam & Max Season 3 or something else. DOS? Yeah, depends.
[25010.70s -> 25020.50s]  One of those things will be tomorrow. I kind of... Hold on. I want to... Like, hold on a second.
[25024.06s -> 25027.90s]  I'm just curious as to what the big... The really, really popular courses are. All right.
[25028.78s -> 25035.37s]  I mean, let me... Okay, hold on. Planet... Planetary exploration. Let me just see what it is.
[25035.37s -> 25038.65s]  This is like the one of the... This is the most popular course in the world. Let me just see what
[25038.65s -> 25056.20s]  it is. This is the... This is the most popular course in the entire universe. Did we... A raid
[25056.20s -> 25066.06s]  came in? Oh, shit. That was Swordy Way. Thank you, Swordy Way, for the raid. Welcome, guys.
[25067.08s -> 25071.32s]  Is it giving me the middle finger? Oh, it's a rocket ship. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I died.
[25071.32s -> 25077.37s]  Let me... Hold on. We're about to stop the stream, unfortunately. Sorry.
[25078.25s -> 25084.15s]  But welcome. Hope you had a good stream. All right, let's see. So you get the fire flower
[25084.87s -> 25100.22s]  and then the take off and lift off. All right, there it is. All right, that's cool. I want to
[25100.22s -> 25143.59s]  get right on top. Why is this the most popular? That's cute and interesting. It has a good song.
[25144.55s -> 25159.24s]  That's cute. The rocket ship takes off and you fly. That's nice. That's nice. There's more, too.
[25159.24s -> 25166.02s]  Look at this. It's a jellyfish. Oh, we're on the moon. I get it. He's a moon jellyfish.
[25166.74s -> 25197.45s]  I knew it. This is the best song, too. I don't think they'll ever make a Mario game that has
[25197.45s -> 25229.46s]  a song that's better than this one. They really won't ever. Stop trying to act cool. What? Am I
[25229.54s -> 25262.78s]  out of oxygen? That's a UFO. Oh, Bowser's an alien. I get it. Nice. What's he gonna take me?
[25263.50s -> 25289.27s]  What's he gonna take me? Get on there. That was really cute. That's pretty nice. Wait, batter up,
[25289.27s -> 25299.19s]  swipe the incoming shells. I know the stream's over, but hold on. And it's Cake Mario, so that's
[25299.83s -> 25328.79s]  already a plus two letter grade. Is this for the... I did it. Home run. Oh, this is it.
[25329.43s -> 25354.47s]  You guys don't even think I fucking know what I'm doing. Shit! I need another one. Give me another
[25354.47s -> 25373.56s]  ball. Where are they? Down here? Oh, no. No, do that again. I want to do that again. I fucking love
[25373.56s -> 25404.58s]  Cake Mario. All right. Boink, boink. Now, this one's fast. Oh, the next one is. It's this one
[25404.58s -> 25438.65s]  that's just like boom. Got it. Oh, that was a curve ball. I think the tail is a cape. No,
[25438.65s -> 25455.51s]  I'm saying cake. C-A-K-E, like Cake Mario, not Cape Mario. Let's see. De-stress land. Cake Mario
[25455.51s -> 25478.09s]  again. Back to back. Why do I call it Cake Mario? Do I have to actually explain this?
[25480.87s -> 25486.38s]  Back in like 1997, when you went to the grocery store to buy a birthday cake,
[25487.51s -> 25494.82s]  this is exactly what was in the display. This outline thick... it looked like this.
[25495.70s -> 25520.47s]  This is a grocery store Mario cake from like 1996. I guess I had to explain that. All right. That
[25520.47s -> 25525.75s]  felt good. And plus, he looks like the cake version. He looks like a cake.
[25540.33s -> 25543.83s]  There's another one I can say. This is Cake Mario. That's all you need to know.
[25544.55s -> 25609.22s]  Choo. Oh, why did it stop? No. Stress free. Happy. It's called Hardcore Jumps. And that is it.
[25609.22s -> 25616.14s]  This will take us... this already is seven hours. Never mind. That's back to back to back.
[25616.14s -> 25622.54s]  That's my favorite Mario. I mean, he has... there are other names for this Mario.
[25623.26s -> 25629.50s]  There's Keychain Mario. This is also Keychain Mario. In fact, I would say that the small Mario
[25629.50s -> 25635.30s]  is Keychain Mario. And the big one is Cake Mario. It's for this style.
[25653.30s -> 25657.78s]  At least five people know what I'm talking about. That was fun.
[25657.78s -> 25682.94s]  So we run 10 seconds. I'll try it. Not Cake Mario. Okay. You have to open doors and shit.
[25684.06s -> 25707.98s]  I'm gonna die. I think I'm dead. Open doors. Hit the switch. I can do it. Just kill me.
[25723.16s -> 25741.27s]  All right. Jump. And then down, down, down, down, down, down, down. Oh, that was close.
[25742.15s -> 25760.17s]  I didn't do the spring. Yeah, I'm not done. I want to do a couple more speedy ones.
[25761.27s -> 25774.25s]  Spectacular Sky Sprint. 20 seconds. There he is. Keychain Magnet Mario.
[25777.93s -> 25789.90s]  I just had to run.
[25797.98s -> 25829.40s]  I'm not sure how you do that much faster. Let me try. It's very... it's not hard.
[25829.40s -> 25877.22s]  No. 20 seconds. Teehee 2. Grab all 69 coins. Well, I know where the Teehee comes from.
[25879.66s -> 25923.80s]  Pretty clean. Is it tied? I'm tied for world record. I'm sure everybody is. Okay. Speedrun.
[25923.80s -> 25937.74s]  Here we go. Showstopper. You held right at the start like the world record holder.
[25937.90s -> 26004.49s]  Oh, that was cheeky. All right. What do we got? Short and sweet. Puzzle solving. Solve thing.
[26005.37s -> 26014.87s]  20 second snow run. We're not going to go much longer. Don't worry. Get 120 coins.
[26039.66s -> 26064.06s]  What? Oh, I went over the... Oh, that sucks. Hold on. What are you talking about? Wait. I can't even
[26064.06s -> 26067.26s]  read. I'm not going to read that. But everyone in the chat that can read what you just wrote.
[26067.26s -> 26083.66s]  What are you talking about? It's fucking gross. I don't even know what you mean by that.
[26084.22s -> 26112.10s]  What's wrong with you guys? Why are you writing that? Oh, I like these. Okay. This is only 8%
[26112.10s -> 26140.62s]  completion though. Why? That seems pretty low. Have you done Bowser's big... I've not done that.
[26140.62s -> 26165.67s]  I've not done Bowser's big burrito. Bowser's big bean burrito?
[26189.22s -> 26221.90s]  All right. What is it? What is it? I'll do it after this. What's Bowser's burrito? Is it me?
[26221.90s -> 26231.16s]  That's me. No, it's not. It's another fucking guy with the frog hat on. All right. What is it?
[26242.28s -> 26270.39s]  8 vs 3. Okay. No one. 8 vs 3. W0. 7 vs. Bowser's big bean burrito. What the fuck is this?
[26271.11s -> 26305.50s]  I just wiped out the floor. I think there's going to be a P block for that. What? Oh. I don't
[26305.50s -> 26323.85s]  understand. What are you supposed to do about that ending? Let's be real here. What is that?
[26339.00s -> 26345.98s]  Wait, that goes... I thought maybe I could... What? I pressed the button twice.
[26373.26s -> 26408.79s]  Why did you want to play that? Oh, it's... Oh, did... Dunky made this? No, no. Okay. Okay. I played it.
[26408.79s -> 26431.53s]  Okay. All right. Do 1-1 with a twist. All right. I'll do that one too. And then we're going about
[26435.46s -> 26450.09s]  1-T-W. L-L-B. Uh, 1-S-F. All right. This is it. This is truly the last one.
[26450.09s -> 26458.76s]  This is called 1-W-1-1 slip and slide. Sliding is key for speed. Can you find all three bonus
[26458.76s -> 26520.44s]  super coins? This is not the right one. Well, I'll try this one anyway. This one's fun. Oh shit.
[26520.44s -> 26544.23s]  I wasn't supposed to even do this one. Do the real one? I will. But I'm already through 1-1-W.
[26545.51s -> 26561.27s]  I'm almost halfway there. Shit. Thought I had it. Oh, that's a shitty jump.
[26562.07s -> 26584.62s]  Is there a mushroom in any of these? The audio fucked up? Yeah, it sometimes happens that for a
[26584.62s -> 26601.59s]  while. I'm sorry. It's been off for a long time. So the audio is early. The game audio is early?
[26602.79s -> 26615.19s]  Hold on. What? That's weird. I already have it set to 100 milliseconds to offset it. I have to do
[26615.19s -> 26638.71s]  it again. That's weird. I don't know why it does that. Oh shit. That's bad. Okay. Well,
[26638.71s -> 26667.59s]  I found the dev thing. No, I didn't. All right. That's fine. Not enough momentum. How am I going
[26667.59s -> 26679.77s]  to fit in there? I need to- Oh, I have to try one more time. Damn it. I'm just gonna- I'm going to
[26679.77s -> 26684.60s]  lean back in my chair. That's not going to work. Crouch? I was trying to crouch. I couldn't do it.
[26685.40s -> 26726.54s]  I was trying. I promise I was trying. Hurry up. That's one way to do it. That's how you do it,
[26726.54s -> 26731.56s]  apparently. One way. I said the same thing twice, but different ways. I said another thing the same
[26731.56s -> 26749.59s]  way, but twice. All right. What is the actual one that you guys wanted to see? Do you stand or sit
[26749.59s -> 26757.27s]  when you wipe? Neither. I lurch down and push my ass down into the toilet and shake in the water.
[26757.27s -> 26761.51s]  And then fucking like after like a 10, 20 seconds just lift up and like wipe the rest of my like
[26761.51s -> 26781.53s]  cheeks and shit. Where is the one? I played a hundred courses. Cool. YXL? Is that the one?
[26781.53s -> 26794.42s]  I need to see it like at least a few times. All right. YXL. Hopefully this is the one.
[26795.22s -> 26813.08s]  I think it is. D4C. 1-1 but with a twist. Super Mario Brothers 1-1 with a tiny twist. Are you
[26813.08s -> 26818.28s]  ready for a brand new 1-1 experience? And like three people have beaten this level
[26818.28s -> 26833.99s]  in the fucking world. 0.02 percent. I get a better return on my bank savings account annually
[26833.99s -> 26858.73s]  than that. Just saying. No one's gonna be... What is it? Impossible? Yeah. It looks like it.
[26860.73s -> 26867.61s]  1-1 with a twist. Yeah, it's kind of a very obvious twist. You just threw up shit everywhere. You
[26867.61s -> 26882.50s]  just made it impossible. Well, it's obviously left, right. Okay. Hold on now. Just give me a
[26882.50s -> 26892.57s]  second. Okay. And then that's left. Run all the way to the right. I'm going to do this by timing
[26892.57s -> 26914.09s]  only. One. Yeah. You stay over here for another second. I think you have to... Maybe I think you
[26914.09s -> 26930.79s]  have to jump up onto that one. Onto that base. Yeah. You got to get up on that base and then
[26930.79s -> 26941.16s]  to the right. Hold on. Yeah. All right. Hold on. I'm making progress here very slowly.
[26947.51s -> 26958.76s]  I made progress. I went forward more than I did. Holy shit. I almost just fucking got real damn far.
[26958.76s -> 26983.08s]  All right. Now I'm doing it. I guess you have to jump. You got to get faster than that. And
[26983.08s -> 26986.68s]  you get a straight shot over there. I think you have to jump up on top of the... You know what
[26986.68s -> 26996.47s]  I mean? Yep. I got to go faster than that. I had it. I had progress. Come on. What's the time on
[26996.47s -> 27022.44s]  this one? Like 10 seconds? Progress. I got to go early. I had to get that fucking time. I was going
[27022.52s -> 27036.81s]  so fast. This is jump over it? I think you jump over it. Yeah. You have to jump all the way over
[27036.81s -> 27055.27s]  it. Otherwise you hit by that one. No. Caught on. There it was. There it was. No. That's it. I had
[27055.27s -> 27063.34s]  it right. You got to jump over it and then you got to keep running. I had it right. You got to go
[27063.34s -> 27089.88s]  clean over it and then run. That was it. But it's got to be a little bit hair later. Later than that
[27089.88s -> 27104.26s]  too. I was almost there. I just need to get... Look where everyone's dying. I have to get like
[27104.26s -> 27128.44s]  at least past this one part. I wonder if you jump up or if you have to just wait. I have a better
[27128.44s -> 27156.14s]  idea. Silent. Watch this. I have to make it all the way over there so we don't hear like this.
[27166.14s -> 27190.47s]  Ten more tries and then I'm done. Oh wait. They can hear me. Usually I can do that and you guys
[27190.47s -> 27207.78s]  do the game audio. We'll block it out. I can't get this first jump now. No. I can't. Maybe I should
[27207.78s -> 27228.58s]  go over? No. I have to have to do it like this. That was it. I almost went too fast.
[27241.21s -> 27252.94s]  No. Am I going too late? Maybe I'm going too late. I am going too late. I gotta jump over that.
[27252.94s -> 27263.14s]  All right. I gotta jump over that. I gotta go way earlier. Shit. I got caught on the stupid
[27263.14s -> 27293.88s]  fucking metal thing. Why would anybody sit here and beat this? Holy shit. Is that safe over here?
[27293.88s -> 27317.72s]  I got a coin. Nowhere is safe. I feel like that wasn't even there before.
[27317.72s -> 27324.50s]  It's safe! No it's not. Oh you have to. Okay so you have to wait, run, and then jump to the right.
[27324.50s -> 27331.77s]  No way. Is that actually what you're supposed to do? Because it's safe in the middle there for a
[27331.77s -> 27357.86s]  second. Yeah you gotta get right over there and jump up. All right. Yeah I don't care. Yeah I'm
[27357.86s -> 27371.42s]  done. I don't give a shit. Who cares? Damn it. I just want to get to the pipe. If I get to the pipe
[27371.42s -> 27374.86s]  I win. I just want to get to the pipe. That's all I care about. I don't care about anything else.
[27374.86s -> 27395.45s]  It's the pipe. Fuck. I thought I had time to write. Why don't we do this to ourselves? Should I jump
[27395.45s -> 27414.22s]  up? Hold on. Can I? If I go fast enough can I jump on top of that? I don't. Maybe I can. No I can't.
[27415.02s -> 27424.50s]  Maybe? No you can't. No. All right. Three more tries and then I'm going to press the off button
[27424.50s -> 27433.34s]  on the switch because I won't leave if I don't. One. Damn it. That was close. Oh man. You have
[27433.34s -> 27440.52s]  to go all the way to the right and you have to run back. That one didn't count. You have to
[27440.52s -> 27451.85s]  land over here. That's one. Counts. All right. That's two. So I've got to get over there and
[27451.85s -> 27459.64s]  stand there and then run left. How did you know I was pointing at the screen? Wait. How did you know
[27459.64s -> 27471.99s]  I was pointing? I was intensely pointing at the screen. All right. That's two. Here comes three.
[27471.99s -> 27483.43s]  Is it? No. Just let me get over to the right once. That's it. I'm done. I have to turn the
[27483.43s -> 27502.26s]  switch off. All right. That's as far as I'm going to go. Turn off the switch. Okay. I'm good. Let's
[27502.26s -> 27522.42s]  go. That's it. It's too addicting. They make it too addicting. You just have to sit there and
[27523.30s -> 27535.88s]  smash your head against a wall. That's it. Thanks everybody for watching. I will see you guys
[27535.88s -> 27541.40s]  tomorrow. I'm not sure what we're going to do yet. There are plenty of options. Figure it out before
[27541.40s -> 27551.98s]  we start. Same time. So let's go back. Let's do the bits and the subs and everything earlier.
[27551.98s -> 27560.78s]  And thanks for watching. Mario Maker is always a fun time. Mario Maker is a roller coaster of
[27560.78s -> 27568.74s]  emotions for me. I go up and down and up and down and up and down over the course of the whole night.
[27569.54s -> 27589.14s]  But it's always a blast. It is. So back earlier, we had... Let's see here. We had five dollars from
[27589.14s -> 27595.19s]  Kill Ganon. Thank you, Kill Ganon. I don't have much to give, but I made this level specifically
[27595.19s -> 27599.35s]  because I wanted you to play it. And nobody has beaten it yet. Please play it. I'm proud of it.
[27600.33s -> 27606.74s]  Did we do that one? I think we did this one. Does this code is remind... I think I've seen...
[27606.74s -> 27627.11s]  I thought this code earlier. I just like rage turned off my switch. Scamming Mario levels.
[27627.75s -> 27640.10s]  I don't think you played it. Well, here. Here, you guys take this one and let me know how it is.
[27640.74s -> 27646.95s]  I'm just gonna type it because I can't... I apparently can't copy and paste it.
[27647.67s -> 27665.03s]  I feel like I did this one. He beat Bowser's big bean burrito. Yeah, I did. But sorry,
[27665.03s -> 27671.67s]  I didn't get to your level if I didn't. I wasn't doing donations for levels except for the one
[27671.67s -> 27676.33s]  time because the person put a fish in their comments. So I was kind of just pulling them
[27676.33s -> 27685.35s]  out of chat. So thank you for the five dollars. Really appreciate it. Thank you to Dork Cube for
[27685.35s -> 27690.47s]  the 250. How did you get the carnival stream off the ground this quick? But years of the blue
[27690.47s -> 27703.40s]  toothbrush already went over it, but thank you again for the 250. Appreciate it. Thank you to
[27703.40s -> 27710.68s]  Uncle Joe for the 250. Not able to catch the whole stream, but I made a remix for all the zoomers in
[27710.68s -> 27724.20s]  chat. Let me disconnect this. Oh, I just like punched my monitor. I just saw the crystal goo
[27724.20s -> 27730.49s]  shit for like flash. All right, it's fine. No, it's not. It's broken. I actually just broke the
[27730.49s -> 27736.66s]  monitor. I pulled out my headphones and my index finger just bumped it and it like broke the edge
[27736.66s -> 27741.27s]  here. Not enough to be noticeable, but enough where I'm going to look at it and go I'm an idiot
[27741.27s -> 27749.64s]  and I hate that. It's just a tiny little bit in the corner. It's fine. It may actually have even
[27749.64s -> 27760.87s]  been there before and I just noticed it now. Shit. Oh, that was definitely there before. Oh no,
[27760.87s -> 27765.85s]  I mean, I'm even stupider. That's part of the desktop background. Yeah, that's a star in the
[27765.85s -> 27772.86s]  sky on the desktop background, I think. I'll have to check that out later. But here is a remix. It's
[27772.86s -> 27792.31s]  a SoundCloud link. I need to be able to hear this though. Copy that link. Turn this down a little
[27867.06s -> 27872.92s]  That's pretty good. Here's the link for all you that want it.
[27876.23s -> 27882.02s]  Thank you for that, Uncle Joe. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[27888.92s -> 27894.28s]  And then Zeke gave 250. Thank you, Zeke. This is probably the most wholesome video ever. Please
[27894.28s -> 27907.13s]  watch this with the stream. Oh, this is like that. Completely honest here. It's so bright out right
[27907.13s -> 27911.61s]  now because the sun is shining on the snow. There's laser beams shooting into my eyes.
[27919.37s -> 27932.18s]  You all right, Jeremy? Laser beams. Laser beams. I used to have to hang around with
[27932.82s -> 27939.16s]  chat for a long time and other people that weren't from the area. I lost a huge amount of my like
[27939.16s -> 27952.46s]  Boston accent. Laser beams. It used to be so much heavier. It still comes up from time to time. It
[27952.46s -> 27965.67s]  still does. I'm not going to watch this whole video. Say room. Room. I mean, yeah. If you have
[27965.67s -> 27970.50s]  like an English accent, you can't just like stop having it. Yeah. And okay. Yeah. Spider-Man is
[27970.50s -> 27974.98s]  really good at that. He can do that pretty well. But not all of us are like Academy Award winning
[27974.98s -> 27986.26s]  actors. Yes. There are two people that you know. They're Dr. Greghouse and Spider-Man are really,
[27986.26s -> 27995.64s]  really good at it. And the guy that played the big, the guy that played the dragon in Lord of the
[27995.64s -> 28011.30s]  Rings. Mr. Strange. Dr. Strange. Say popcorn. Popcorn. Popcorn. What's wrong with that?
[28011.86s -> 28023.80s]  I think you beat the 250. Thank you to Spamite for $3. Play my level or else I'll remove your
[28023.80s -> 28030.65s]  gamer privileges. I'm sorry I was not doing donations for levels. The one person gave $50
[28030.65s -> 28034.66s]  and put a fish in their comment and that's the only one I did. I kind of wanted this to be
[28035.46s -> 28041.93s]  throw them in here and we'll play them. But I do appreciate the level and hopefully I did get to
[28041.93s -> 28046.78s]  at least one of them because I did do a lot. I did probably at least like 20 or so. 20 or 30.
[28049.59s -> 28063.80s]  $50 for levels. Popcorn. Popcorn. Popcorn. Thank you for the $3 Spamite.
[28068.01s -> 28073.77s]  Editing your streams has given me 4% Boston accent. Max accent is probably now 20% Boston,
[28073.77s -> 28085.77s]  70% British, and 10% normal. What is normal? Hey Swyd. Thanks for the $5 Swyd Harry. Hey
[28085.77s -> 28091.02s]  Jerma. Are you going to be at Evo? I don't know. I don't know. It's going to be tough
[28092.41s -> 28099.93s]  because today is what Thursday? So Thursday, Friday, Saturday. I plan on streaming three
[28099.93s -> 28106.12s]  days in a row but I might I don't know because I'm not going to be here. I'm not going to be here
[28106.12s -> 28113.98s]  next week for at least a couple days. So it's going to be kind of it's going to be hard to go
[28113.98s -> 28126.01s]  to Evo. I might try to show up on Sunday just to kind of pop around. But if you weren't here earlier
[28126.01s -> 28132.33s]  the reason why I'm not going to be here early next week is I am going to the robot facility
[28133.13s -> 28136.15s]  to we're going to do a walkthrough. We're going to hammer down every single detail.
[28136.79s -> 28143.43s]  I've got to exchange some money and we're going to do some talking. We're going to go over everything.
[28143.43s -> 28151.42s]  I want to kind of just be like a name to a face rather than just because I want to know. I kind
[28151.42s -> 28154.22s]  of want to see what's going on. I see what they're doing. See the progress and stuff.
[28155.02s -> 28166.26s]  So I don't just want to be like hey let's do all that stuff and then hey I'll see you in September.
[28166.26s -> 28173.08s]  By the way September 21st is the day of that stream. Not likely to really be changed. I don't
[28173.08s -> 28177.24s]  think that's going to happen. It seems pretty unlikely because there's like three companies
[28177.24s -> 28184.10s]  involved. So it's not a case of like you know I feel like doing it on next Thursday.
[28184.82s -> 28189.30s]  So there was way too many people involved. So it's Saturday. It's going to be Saturday the 21st. I
[28189.30s -> 28199.46s]  believe it's Saturday. Is that a Saturday? I think it is. Yeah the 21st Saturday September.
[28206.07s -> 28209.75s]  What does the carnival stream mean? I'll give you a quick little rundown.
[28210.47s -> 28219.18s]  September 21st I am going to a robot warehouse facility to collaborate with a group of engineers.
[28219.18s -> 28222.38s]  Oh they already would have made them. That's what this next week is for.
[28222.94s -> 28230.10s]  To make a bunch of robots with another company. To then make them controllable by Twitch. To play
[28230.66s -> 28236.26s]  a bunch of carnival games. One of which the main attraction is to dunk me in a dunk tank with a
[28236.26s -> 28257.72s]  pitching machine. It's one of them. And yeah and they're all the robots are going to be controlled
[28257.72s -> 28263.91s]  by Twitch. Midway games, carnival games, there's going to be a bunch of them. There's going to be
[28263.91s -> 28268.47s]  at least a few different robots that you're going to be able to control as a collective group. Let's
[28268.47s -> 28277.10s]  hope you can do it. How did you find the people to do this for you? This has taken a year to figure
[28277.10s -> 28285.40s]  this out. I have wanted to do this stream since summertime before I moved to Vegas.
[28286.04s -> 28309.38s]  Is it going to be one game at a time? Yes. It's going to be a big carnival with a midway,
[28309.38s -> 28314.98s]  different all these booths. There might be other things there, other machines to mess around with.
[28316.10s -> 28320.18s]  Over the course of the day the stream is probably going to be, well it depends on how good you guys
[28320.18s -> 28330.82s]  can play. I mean we might have to, I don't know, if you guys can dunk me in like 10 seconds then
[28330.82s -> 28338.50s]  all right. We'll see how many times you guys can do it. In before it's a bit it is not. I can assure
[28338.50s -> 28344.39s]  you of that. These are real robots, really controlled by you guys, really happening on the
[28344.39s -> 28350.49s]  21st. It's not a bit. I can promise you that. I mean they might be jokes in that stream but that
[28350.49s -> 28361.24s]  is actually for real. That's not like a joke. You will be able to do that. Judging by chat's
[28361.24s -> 28364.28s]  pick cross ability, I don't think we're going to be very, you're not going to have to worry about
[28364.28s -> 28386.10s]  that. You're going to put any protective measures in there. We have a bunch of ways to,
[28389.77s -> 28394.57s]  the way that I was described to me, the way that we talked about it, is we can set it,
[28395.21s -> 28398.89s]  the different inputs, to have to have a certain amount of inputs for it to work.
[28398.89s -> 28404.89s]  So let's say for instance, let's say that it's going really crazy and there's like 20,000 inputs
[28404.89s -> 28413.05s]  and like 20,000 of them like to go left, right? We can make it so there has to be a certain amount
[28413.05s -> 28418.81s]  to make it even move an inch left. You know what I'm saying? We can kind of mitigate like huge,
[28418.81s -> 28426.49s]  huge just spam by making, let's say, oh turn left, needs like 3,000 inputs to go left an inch.
[28426.49s -> 28430.73s]  But right could be like two inputs. We might just have fun. We might fuck around with it.
[28431.69s -> 28441.46s]  The people that are working with me on this have done shit like this before, so they're very
[28441.46s -> 28448.49s]  knowledgeable on how all this will work. They seem to be very, very much in touch with what we want
[28448.49s -> 28467.10s]  to do. Do you get tickets? No, not yet. I've kind of fought with the idea of should I do a thing
[28467.10s -> 28471.90s]  where you like give bits and you can like play a game or something. I don't want to do that.
[28472.86s -> 28475.34s]  I feel like it's more fun when everyone's kind of fighting with each other.
[28478.20s -> 28484.36s]  It was also an idea of like have a separate segment that was, oh you have to, if you pay
[28484.36s -> 28489.48s]  money, you only are the one that gets to control the machine for like two or three throws or
[28489.48s -> 28499.38s]  something, right? But then it became, how much money is that? What's that gonna be? Is that a
[28499.38s -> 28504.34s]  dollar? Is that five dollars? Is that ten dollars? And what happens if like five fucking hundred
[28504.34s -> 28511.13s]  people do that? Are you gonna have five hundred people lined up? It's gonna take like 12 hours.
[28511.85s -> 28525.00s]  So I think it's more fun when everybody just kind of can try to control it. Because that
[28525.96s -> 28529.64s]  makes more sense as to the nature of this whole stream in the first place.
[28533.61s -> 28538.89s]  But besides that, there's another way maybe to like, oh if you, one of the things that I
[28538.89s -> 28544.33s]  thought was interesting, remember the, that like cash machine? Remember I told you guys I was like
[28544.33s -> 28551.13s]  really good at it. Maybe if like once every, once like a hundred bucks comes through, I would like
[28551.13s -> 28556.73s]  get in that thing and try to grab them. I don't know. There's a lot of different ideas that are
[28556.73s -> 28566.52s]  not connected to the robots. The robots are set in stone and we've got like two or three weeks
[28566.52s -> 28571.64s]  to figure out kind of the other stuff we want in there to supplement all the cool stuff to do with
[28571.64s -> 28579.82s]  the robots. It's not just going to be, here are a bunch of games you control with a robot. We're
[28579.82s -> 28586.28s]  gonna have little segments in between. There's gonna be maybe some actors that come through and
[28586.28s -> 28597.54s]  you know, clown around in massive gigantic fucking quotes. The whole stream will probably
[28597.54s -> 28602.02s]  be somewhere around like five to seven hours. It's gonna be a whole thing. It's gonna take that long
[28602.02s -> 28607.77s]  for you to even probably go through the games themselves. It's, this is not gonna be like a
[28607.77s -> 28613.54s]  30 minute stream. This is gonna be all day. It's gonna take probably four, five plus hours to go
[28613.54s -> 28629.29s]  through all this. What time is it gonna start? It's gonna be on eastern time, although I'm not
[28629.29s -> 28635.34s]  gonna be in Massachusetts like a lot of you might think. I will be on eastern time though.
[28642.79s -> 28647.94s]  September 21st, that's right. And besides the robot stuff, these are all just ideas that I'm
[28647.94s -> 28651.54s]  throwing out. Obviously none of this is set in stone besides the date and besides the robots
[28652.42s -> 28657.42s]  and the games that those robots are controlling. We got, remember I told you that
[28658.06s -> 28662.94s]  over the next, you know, I said this probably like two or three weeks ago, that I was going to dial
[28662.94s -> 28671.18s]  back streams to really make sure I get this rolling. I make sure I have the necessary time to
[28671.82s -> 28675.66s]  put into this and I can travel and go back and forth and make sure I can take care of this and
[28675.66s -> 28679.26s]  make it as good as I can. Like this is the reason why, because we still have to figure some of the
[28679.26s -> 28693.93s]  stuff out. But I will give more details when I have them, but I am going to hammer pretty much
[28693.93s -> 28710.28s]  every week here that the 21st is the date that you want to save if you want to be around. Should
[28710.28s -> 28723.88s]  be fun. And it's tough with stuff like this because even if I say this right now, tomorrow
[28723.88s -> 28727.56s]  a shitload of people are not even going to know that I said this. A week from now, a bunch of
[28727.56s -> 28732.60s]  people, it's not the same people every stream. So you're, there's always going to be somebody
[28732.60s -> 28736.84s]  that needs to kind of know. And I think I'm probably going to set up a command to have it
[28736.84s -> 28745.40s]  just be like, Carnival! Hey, September 21st! Because every day there's new people. So there'll
[28745.40s -> 28748.52s]  probably be a command. I'll probably play, I'll probably get like a little thing made,
[28749.16s -> 28752.52s]  like a 30 second promo video or something to play over the next like few weeks.
[28757.03s -> 28768.44s]  SusCarnival. Pin a tweet. Yeah, I'll pin a tweet too. That's a good idea. What is my pin tweet? Oh,
[28768.44s -> 28780.68s]  it's the t-shirts, right. But we'll move on. I just want to be clear about that because we did,
[28780.68s -> 28784.76s]  I talked about it a little bit at the beginning of the stream, but not to that level because we're
[28784.76s -> 28797.78s]  just kind of sitting here. But thank you to Appleshift for the 250. Hey man, I read somewhere
[28797.78s -> 28805.00s]  that your favorite band is the Gorillaz. It is. What's your favorite song of theirs? PS, my friend
[28805.00s -> 28809.72s]  Briar loves you, but since he lives in Australia, he can't usually watch your streams in full since
[28809.72s -> 28815.56s]  they're mostly while he is asleep. So I'm sending you good vibes on his behalf. Thank you for
[28815.56s -> 28823.40s]  everything. Yeah, time zones are really tricky. Some of us are just across the entire world
[28824.04s -> 28835.78s]  from each other. Australia, I think is like plus 16 hours from now from Pacific. It's like plus
[28835.78s -> 28844.39s]  14 or plus 16. It's something crazy. The whole day in the future. It's 5 PM right now, Australia.
[28846.23s -> 28855.19s]  Wow, it is almost midnight. It is 1159 PM Thursday. So you're telling me that it is 5 PM
[28855.91s -> 28865.93s]  Friday? Or is it 5 PM Saturday? No, 5 PM Friday. Damn, that's very, that's really insane.
[28867.38s -> 28878.31s]  3 PM. Jeez. And it's like 3 AM Eastern too. Time zones are fucking messed up. But my favorite song
[28878.31s -> 28887.80s]  from the Gorillaz is, I mean, I just like Stylo. Stylo just, I like the, I like the kick. Stylo.
[28889.90s -> 28903.78s]  If it wasn't Stylo, it would probably be, there's a lot. Probably, probably something from Plastic
[28903.78s -> 28912.33s]  Beach or Demon Days. Pick a random song out of either of those two albums. Everything else is
[28912.33s -> 28921.18s]  like number two. Melancholy Hill is good too. Yeah, it is. I liked a lot of the stuff in,
[28921.82s -> 28934.86s]  in Humans. That album was kind of hit or miss for me. But the ones that hit, I thought were really,
[28934.86s -> 28950.30s]  really good. Yeah, Stylo though, for sure. I don't know a lot of people that liked Humans.
[28950.30s -> 28953.26s]  Yeah, but that's what I mean though. Like half the tracks on Humans, I was kind of like,
[28953.26s -> 28958.92s]  oh, what the fuck is going on here? A lot of the tracks on Humans were just kind of like noise.
[28959.88s -> 28964.98s]  It was really experimental noise songs. And then the other half were like, oh, this is fucking,
[28964.98s -> 28980.31s]  this is awesome. This is exactly what I'm looking for. But thank you to Gnarly for the $2.50. They
[28980.31s -> 28992.39s]  just say donation. Thank you. Thank you for the donation. That was Gnarly. Daring Shepherd,
[28992.39s -> 29003.98s]  thanks for the $4. Have my paper trading goods. I will take them. Thank you. General Arse,
[29003.98s -> 29011.32s]  thanks for the $3. Play my level. I'm sorry I didn't do the levels from the donations.
[29011.80s -> 29017.99s]  Hopefully somebody played it, but I appreciate it. Thank you for the three bucks.
[29020.52s -> 29024.76s]  Vidis, thanks for the $10.80 is another level code. Beat it if you think you can.
[29025.48s -> 29038.57s]  I'm sorry I was not doing donation levels. I guess 10 bucks is a lot of money. Thank you for the
[29038.57s -> 29049.30s]  $10.80. People get scammed. Well, hold on though. I never said that I was taking donations for
[29049.30s -> 29070.34s]  levels. I never said that. I didn't say I was doing that. I said a precedent? No, I didn't.
[29073.56s -> 29079.38s]  I didn't take the second bribe level. There were two bribe levels and I didn't do the second one.
[29082.31s -> 29087.35s]  The Bala Koala gave $55 and said, hey, I heard you're taking bribes for levels and I didn't do it.
[29088.50s -> 29098.70s]  In fact, I didn't even say this donation on stream because I didn't see it. Sorry,
[29098.70s -> 29103.90s]  that's a lot of fucking money to miss during the stream. I must have been in the middle of
[29104.46s -> 29117.90s]  a meltdown, but that's $5500. I hate missing huge donations like this. I always feel like a dick,
[29119.24s -> 29122.20s]  but Bala Koala, if you're still here, that's a lot of money. Thank you so much.
[29124.89s -> 29129.37s]  If you make a robot that dabs when someone donates a $10 bill, that robot would never
[29129.37s -> 29136.74s]  stop the whole stream. I don't know. Money gets weird because I don't want to just...
[29138.42s -> 29142.10s]  Sure, okay. I could have a robot in the background that every time somebody donated $10,
[29143.14s -> 29150.31s]  the thing dabbed. I didn't even bring it up. It just was there, but I don't want to put
[29151.27s -> 29158.39s]  my financial obligations onto other people because I decided I was going to do this.
[29160.58s -> 29166.90s]  This stream is going to cost a lot of money, but you didn't tell me to do that. It wasn't like,
[29166.90s -> 29178.10s]  oh, jeez, Jerma. We voted. 20,000 of us voted and 19,990 of us want you to do a robot carnival
[29178.10s -> 29185.77s]  stream. Do it. Hey, I'm going to do this stream and it's going to cost this and this is what it's
[29185.77s -> 29191.43s]  going to be. Please pay for it now, everybody. You already did. I think that's something that
[29191.43s -> 29201.94s]  a lot of people might overlook is you already have. Where do you think I got the money to do
[29201.94s -> 29223.46s]  this stream? I didn't get it from my cryptocurrency investments. I'll tell you. He stole it.
[29231.91s -> 29245.43s]  He finally admits it. I'm just fucking kidding. Come on. He got it from gambling. Yeah, I put it
[29245.99s -> 29252.07s]  up. I put all my money on black and hit it once and freaked the fuck out and exhaled really hard
[29252.07s -> 29268.50s]  and said, holy shit, and I put it on my bank account. No, essentially to me, this stream was
[29268.50s -> 29271.94s]  made possible because there's a lot of people that donate and a lot of people that sub to this
[29271.94s -> 29283.69s]  channel, so the money that comes from that that goes into this is paid for. Now, am I a psycho
[29283.69s -> 29295.10s]  for doing this? Maybe. I don't know. It's very possible. Maybe one day we'll talk about
[29295.10s -> 29302.92s]  how much it was, but that's not a conversation for now. Enjoy it. Let's have fun and don't worry
[29302.92s -> 29322.92s]  about me. As part of your sub to shareholders, I demand the dabbing robot. And by the way,
[29322.92s -> 29326.60s]  that is like easy. If anyone wanted to like contribute or something, it could just be there,
[29326.60s -> 29333.16s]  but then I would want to make it something that it wasn't just me trying to delete money from like,
[29333.16s -> 29340.84s]  oh hey, watch the dabbing robot. It's 10 bucks. Better do it. We'll see. But let's keep going.
[29340.84s -> 29348.06s]  We're almost done. We had a Freudian weapon. Thanks for the 250. Thanks for playing my level
[29348.06s -> 29352.38s]  tonight. I knew you could do it, but I'm glad it wasn't too easy for you. Now to count down the
[29352.38s -> 29369.14s]  days till the carnival. Me too. I'm counting them down as well. Thank you. Acknowledge John for the
[29369.14s -> 29373.94s]  three bucks. Okay, I'm sorry for yelling at you when you were playing Mario, but mom said it was
[29373.94s -> 29377.78s]  my turn when you finished the level and I thought you were just playing bad on purpose.
[29383.54s -> 29388.10s]  Thank you Espadda Escalata for the 250. Jeremiah, I just want to say I enjoyed the bit where you
[29388.10s -> 29395.16s]  pretended to be a good gamer for once. Sometimes I turn it on. Sometimes. It's time for slime.
[29395.16s -> 29397.56s]  Thanks for the five dollars. Thanks for playing my level, Jeremiah Hart.
[29401.37s -> 29409.82s]  Do you know what I like? I'm just thinking about what I want, but it's not going to happen because
[29409.82s -> 29413.90s]  we've already solidified everything that was going to happen because we're getting too close.
[29414.86s -> 29419.66s]  I just thought one of those old Nickelodeon pie machines and just sitting like the...
[29420.38s -> 29425.66s]  If I say like a really bad joke and like it's not funny, then I got to go sit in like the pie pod.
[29426.62s -> 29434.14s]  You remember that fucking thing? Oh, the slime bucket. You know what? That might not be that
[29434.14s -> 29440.54s]  expensive. Having a slime bucket. Okay, I'm going to do like a secret slime action.
[29443.46s -> 29459.66s]  Hold on. Let me think about that. I'll get back to you. The ultimate minus two. Yeah, we'll see.
[29461.72s -> 29472.02s]  But thank you. Thank you to Devakitty for the 250. Jeremy, looking forward to the 21st. Me too.
[29473.21s -> 29476.89s]  In more recent news, however, I've been in the process of being approved for my HRT
[29477.45s -> 29481.61s]  for like 19 months now and hopefully the fifth is the very last of my appointments
[29481.61s -> 29487.53s]  and I'm stoked. Now if you'd excuse me, I'm going to go eat some of these 1.7 kilogram bag of
[29487.53s -> 29493.05s]  hot wings I bought for like seven dollars while enjoying my favorite bite... my favorite bite it
[29493.05s -> 29502.78s]  in Mario over and over again. And then did you call me Mario? Oh, in Mario. All right, I'm going
[29502.78s -> 29519.03s]  to do this math here. 1.7 kg is how much? What bag? How big is that bag? 1.7 kg is how many? Is it
[29519.03s -> 29528.09s]  how many in pounds? That's seven pounds. No, isn't one kilogram 2.2? So what, that's like three?
[29529.59s -> 29536.66s]  Three and a half? That's still a lot. That's a heavy bag. Seven dollars for two, three, four pounds
[29536.66s -> 29552.47s]  of wings? Enjoy them. I like want that now. I so badly want that right now. The time is it is too...
[29552.47s -> 29560.50s]  it's like late. It's like 12 o'clock. I shouldn't have jumped over the fucking stupid ass like fire
[29560.50s -> 29566.26s]  pole a thousand times. If I had just turned off the switch like 30 or 40 minutes before I did,
[29567.14s -> 29570.98s]  I would have been able to eat pizza. Great.
[29581.18s -> 29590.50s]  I'm now... I'm gonna... I'm gonna have to go like eat water. I'm gonna go microwave water and fucking
[29590.50s -> 29606.41s]  like flour. Stir it up. But thank you Devakitty. Appreciate the 250. Thank you to Manboy for the
[29606.41s -> 29610.25s]  250. Hey Jerm, I'm really excited for the carnival stream. I was going to attend my wife's and her
[29610.25s -> 29626.54s]  boyfriend's wedding on the 21st, but not anymore. Wait, wait what? It took me a second to figure that
[29626.54s -> 29643.69s]  out. Okay, sorry. Thank you Manboy for the 250. That's... well, I'm not sure you'd... thank you for
[29643.69s -> 29660.65s]  the 250. Thank you to Devakitty for the 250. Gee Willikers big stream coming up on the 21st. I was
[29660.65s -> 29665.85s]  going to attend the birthday of my firstborn on that day while also delivering my second child
[29665.85s -> 29670.25s]  and going to my grandma's 100th birthday, but there's a Jerma stream on so I won't go to any
[29670.25s -> 29673.21s]  of those really important events because I got to watch the silly streamer in the internet.
[29679.50s -> 29688.68s]  You guys can go to like your family get-togethers. Just pull up your phone and just... you pull up
[29688.68s -> 29696.15s]  your phone. No, don't do that. Don't do that. Don't pull up your phone. That's rude. Look, here's the
[29696.15s -> 29700.47s]  end-all be-all way to get out of any of this shit. No, no, not to get out of it, but you know what
[29700.47s -> 29706.47s]  I mean? Go, enjoy yourself, and then after like an hour or two, just say that like to hold your
[29706.47s -> 29713.03s]  stomach, walk up to somebody and be like, oh it's bad. I'm sorry, I've got to go now. And then like,
[29713.03s -> 29726.26s]  you know, bye, oh good to see you. And then leave and nobody cares. You're not the bad guy. In fact,
[29726.26s -> 29733.38s]  they start to think maybe they are, because why are you at my house consuming these things in my
[29733.38s -> 29739.43s]  house and now all of a sudden you have like a stomach diarrhea? Oh, I got to figure out how's
[29739.43s -> 29770.34s]  that happening. That's really bad advice. Yeah, because it was not real. Don't make it sudden,
[29770.34s -> 29775.22s]  though, or they might find out and get mad. No, yeah, I'm not saying do it immediately.
[29776.42s -> 29780.18s]  You're gonna drive up, pull into the driveway, be like, oh hey, how are you?
[29780.18s -> 29786.90s]  Oh, yeah, it's been what a great day it is. Oh, happy birthday. Oh, my stomach is really bothering
[29786.90s -> 29794.26s]  me. You know, we got to fucking get out of here. Can I use your bathroom? Or, you know, I'm just
[29794.26s -> 29799.46s]  gonna sit there in the middle. Okay, here we go. Oh, there's like 10 of us sitting around. Oh,
[29799.46s -> 29804.42s]  there's George and there's Aunt Edna. They're talking. Oh, Aunt Edna said, let me tell you
[29804.42s -> 29810.42s]  something about being Republican. And then George is like, oh, the Democrats, did you see? Oh,
[29810.42s -> 29814.50s]  my stomach and you stand up. Oh, my stomach's killing me. I'm gonna shit my... Actually,
[29814.50s -> 29823.26s]  it's a great way to get out of that. Take that advice. That's great advice. What perfect advice
[29823.26s -> 29839.64s]  that is. You can use that anywhere. You can even use that if you don't feel like getting like out
[29839.64s -> 29848.30s]  of bed. Hey, are you gonna like get out of bed? Oh, I wish I could, you know, get away from me,
[29848.30s -> 29857.14s]  my stomach, you know. Oh, you're gonna shit. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Bye, bye, bye. Hey, the weeds are
[29857.14s -> 29862.94s]  getting kind of long outside. Oh, but you know, I would hate to shit on them. Yeah, you know,
[29862.94s -> 29871.72s]  you're right. I guess I'll do it. It's just, it's a fifth grader discovering how to lie to get out
[29871.72s -> 29883.06s]  of school. But the problem is, if you do that too often, then yeah. It's like going, going to the,
[29883.06s -> 29888.50s]  everybody, come on, everybody used to do this. You take a thermometer, right? So like mom comes
[29888.50s -> 29893.54s]  in, here's a thermometer. Oh, boy. Oh, I think you're sick today. Oh, yeah, I don't feel good
[29893.54s -> 29897.38s]  today. Well, here's the thermometer. Let's see if you got a fever. You put it in, mom leaves the
[29897.38s -> 29903.94s]  room. You go to the sink, the bathroom sink. You put on hot fucking water and you hold it under.
[29903.94s -> 29907.54s]  And you know, you're a dumb kid. You don't understand. So you sit there with burning
[29907.54s -> 29912.90s]  fucking hot water on it. And you end up at like 108 degrees on the thermometer. You put it back
[29912.90s -> 29919.06s]  in and you're like, Oh mom, something's wrong. Like, Oh, let me see, honey. Oh, you're dead.
[29919.06s -> 29923.78s]  You're not alive. You're actually not alive right now. Interesting. Oh, you know, you must be,
[29923.78s -> 29940.14s]  you can't go to school today. 107 degrees, 106 degree fever. Wow. I remember one time I put
[29940.14s -> 29946.66s]  orange juice in my mouth and went, my grandmother was there at the time. And I was like, Oh, here
[29946.66s -> 29950.82s]  we go. I'm going to be able to fool my grandmother. She's not going to be able to know that I got,
[29950.82s -> 29954.58s]  I'm just going to like put orange juice in my mouth. And like I lied on the ground,
[29954.58s -> 29958.66s]  face down. I could, I could put the orange juice in my mouth and like switched it around. So it
[29958.66s -> 29962.98s]  was real salivary. My grandmother was walking down the hall and I was waiting. Here she comes,
[29963.70s -> 29970.74s]  prone on the ground. She walked in and I was, I was putting my fist down, up and down.
[29973.62s -> 29977.22s]  Up and down. Like pretend I'm a child, pretend having a tantrum.
[29978.42s -> 29985.13s]  And just went and let it out. The orange juice. And she just looked at me. She's like, go to,
[29985.13s -> 29991.34s]  you're going to school. What are you doing? Like it did not even work at all. It was like,
[29991.34s -> 29995.14s]  she thought I was doing a joke. She was like, clean, clean that up. What are you doing?
[29995.78s -> 29999.35s]  Get it. You don't even have your clothes on. Get in the fucking car.
[30000.07s -> 30022.86s]  Clean that shit up. What is this? Oh, just kidding grandma. Kids do dumb things. But I mean,
[30022.86s -> 30027.66s]  that was, I think I was probably like at least I was old enough to know better. Let's put it that
[30027.66s -> 30034.81s]  I was like 12. You know, I was like, I was like 11 or 12. Like, come on, you're going to do like
[30034.81s -> 30047.58s]  the fake puke scenario. Actually, that's probably the perfect age for it. I also used to be scared
[30047.58s -> 30051.50s]  of the toilet. The toilet flushing sound scared me and I didn't like to go to the bathroom.
[30051.50s -> 30061.42s]  That has nothing to do with pretending to be sick. I don't know where that transition came from.
[30061.42s -> 30067.37s]  So I guess we're just kind of, I'm just letting it out, I guess. I guess we're just talking about
[30075.45s -> 30088.97s]  it. Anyways, let's keep going. Thank you to Kikira for the 250. They say, hey,
[30088.97s -> 30092.81s]  German, my boyfriend Bryce is turning 22 this week. Would you wish him a happy birthday? He
[30092.81s -> 30106.09s]  loves your content. Absolutely. Turn this off. Hey Bryce, heard you turning 22 this week.
[30106.89s -> 30116.65s]  That's a big number. You're getting there. Keep it up. Stay on track. Okay, that was,
[30116.65s -> 30120.01s]  hold on a minute. That was just like a, that was like a, that website where you pay a celebrity
[30120.01s -> 30125.59s]  to say something for 10 seconds. That was, I just did that. I just did like the celebrity,
[30125.59s -> 30134.74s]  was it called like Cameo? Fiverr? They knock out like 40 of those. No, no, no, no, no. We
[30134.74s -> 30138.74s]  ain't doing it like that. Hey Bryce, happy fucking birthday. Hope you have a good one.
[30139.30s -> 30155.05s]  22 this week. All right. No, now I'm like on it. Hold on. Get it off. Turn it off. Hey, hey,
[30156.01s -> 30165.75s]  uh, hey, Bryce, seriously, happy birthday. I'm glad you're part of this community. Hope you
[30165.75s -> 30175.18s]  have a great one. 22. Knock it out of the park. Thank you. Everybody here says hi. We all fucking,
[30175.18s -> 30179.42s]  you know, we all fucking love you over here. You're, everybody thinks you're fucking awesome.
[30179.42s -> 30189.14s]  All of us in the chat. Look at them. Do you see it? 22. That's a big one here. No, for real,
[30189.14s -> 30197.22s]  thank you so much for the 250 Kikira and a special happy birthday to Bryce. Keep, uh,
[30202.12s -> 30220.78s]  I'm not very good at this. Keep, keep, keep on. Yeah. All right. Now cut that up and like make it
[30220.78s -> 30229.66s]  sound like I'm like smart. That's not how you say his name. B-R-Y-C-E Bryce. That's not Bryce.
[30229.66s -> 30245.16s]  It's B-R-Y-C-E. That's correct. Yeah. Why is everybody yelling at me? Why is everybody
[30245.16s -> 30249.32s]  yelling at me? Or did I die on a 1% completion Mario level for the first time?
[30252.38s -> 30269.56s]  Wipe the sweat off the brow. Hey, you know, for those 1% completion levels,
[30271.10s -> 30286.73s]  there was like 4,000 people here. What is 1% of 4,000? 4. 40. So 40 of you get to say,
[30287.61s -> 30298.17s]  I did it and I could do it. 3,600 of the rest of you didn't do it. Happy birthday, Bryce.
[30298.73s -> 30309.98s]  22? Hell yeah. Jerma put sun chips in F tier thanks to the $10 and I would do it again.
[30309.98s -> 30313.74s]  Thank you, Jerma, for playing my level. It meant everything to me that you're able to enjoy it with
[30313.74s -> 30319.38s]  chat. Spamming minus two the whole time. You are honestly one of my favorite people in the world,
[30319.38s -> 30331.77s]  even if you have such shitty tastes. That was a very long birthday clip. Yeah.
[30335.29s -> 30342.30s]  Fucking comedy. But thank you for the $10. Jerma put sun chips in F tier.
[30344.01s -> 30350.74s]  I did. Abomination zero thanks to the $5. Please play this level. It's my birthday.
[30351.54s -> 30357.54s]  Hold on. Somebody's driving by really fast. Sorry, I didn't play that level. But happy birthday.
[30358.26s -> 30372.18s]  Is your name? What's your name? Abomination zero. Happy birthday. What are sun chips?
[30376.07s -> 30382.14s]  There's this weird like wavy, really grainy wheat kind of tasting, dusted with,
[30382.94s -> 30390.10s]  they're like crispy, but they're not. They're like cardboard crispy. They don't, after like you eat
[30390.10s -> 30399.00s]  three of them, you don't taste it anymore. Okay, I mean, I don't, I would eat them maybe. Okay,
[30399.00s -> 30406.65s]  let's put it this way. If a stewardess or, okay, like a flight attendant, right? Walk down the
[30406.65s -> 30412.14s]  aisle with a bag of sun chips and that's all that was left? Oh, where are the Cheez-Its? We don't
[30412.14s -> 30418.62s]  have any. Where are the pretzels? I'm sorry, we're out of those too. Where are the, what else you got
[30418.62s -> 30426.78s]  in there? What are those? Peanuts? No, we don't have those. Oh, you got sun chips. Okay, I guess
[30426.78s -> 30441.50s]  I'll have a pineapple juice. Wouldn't even need it on a plane. Hey, InvaderZ, thanks for the three
[30441.50s -> 30451.45s]  dollars. Hey, dude, my sister and I got two XL rats today and I wanted to name mine Jeremy,
[30451.45s -> 30458.60s]  but she wouldn't let me. Probably for the best. Anyway, I'm excited to be a rat dad. Love watching
[30458.60s -> 30481.69s]  your streams. Hey, can I name him Jeremy? No. All right. Music's muted. Oh, fuck. Congratulations
[30481.69s -> 30488.39s]  on the rats. They are intelligent. They're fun. They're cuddly. They're passionate. They're
[30489.77s -> 30501.14s]  empathetic. They're, they're very fast. They're very agile. Take it from somebody that has never
[30501.22s -> 30514.12s]  owned one but sees cute videos of them all the time. I'm informed. But thank you. Good luck.
[30514.12s -> 30519.75s]  That sounds awesome. Hey, Weskerun, thanks for the five dollars. Cheers, Jeremy, long time fan. First
[30519.75s -> 30526.62s]  time on stream. What up? They also subbed right before that too, so that's, that's a double.
[30526.62s -> 30543.88s]  Thank you. Thank you, Weskerun, and welcome to the stream. First time on the stream. Thank you,
[30543.88s -> 30553.35s]  Elizabeth, for the three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight dollars. Thank you for the eight
[30553.35s -> 30557.03s]  dollars. Uh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that is not, that is incorrect.
[30559.46s -> 30567.34s]  Elizabeth gave three dollars and then Errolus gave five dollars. It was Elizabeth and then Errolus.
[30568.36s -> 30572.12s]  So Elizabeth, thanks with three bucks. Am I ever going to go back to play more Dreams or did you
[30572.12s -> 30581.24s]  forget about that game? Uh, I actually just got, uh, sad because I wanted to use the move controllers
[30582.04s -> 30588.04s]  and I realized that I gave my PSVR away, which included the PS camera. So I have the move
[30588.04s -> 30592.52s]  controllers here and I was getting it set up and I go, ah, the camera's not here. I gave it away.
[30593.64s -> 30602.46s]  And then that, for some reason, was the wall, me not getting a new PS camera because I really wanted
[30602.46s -> 30619.10s]  to learn how to sculpt with the move controllers. But when does that game actually release? It was
[30619.10s -> 30623.90s]  in like creator access, right? A creator early access, early access. Is it just there still?
[30624.62s -> 30632.92s]  There was a really interesting game, but it was kind of complicated. It was not complicated in
[30632.92s -> 30638.36s]  a sense of creating things, but it takes a lot of time to be able to get anything done,
[30639.16s -> 30647.90s]  which I really don't have. I wish I had the time to dedicate like two or three weeks straight to
[30647.90s -> 30655.64s]  learning how to do that game very well, but I just don't. I just can't. It's a really cool game,
[30655.64s -> 30672.22s]  though. But thank you Errolus for the five dollars. Are my file names like filename01.file?
[30673.02s -> 30678.84s]  How do you format your file names? Well, I can tell you right now. Let's see. Let's just look
[30678.84s -> 30683.40s]  and go into like a folder and like some files that I recently named. Let's see what they say.
[30684.36s -> 30693.32s]  Oh, I gotta go through here. I do one of two things. I either just write the first word that
[30693.32s -> 30707.02s]  the thing is. Okay, so I have in this folder, I got the old emote. So this is just the title.
[30707.02s -> 30721.42s]  This is just old face, old face final. Old is also let's go into this one. Okay, let's see.
[30723.96s -> 30745.72s]  Setup. All right. A2. I don't know what any of these are. 08? No, these are like I don't even
[30745.72s -> 30749.64s]  have any like files anymore. I used to have so many more. What is this? What the fuck is this?
[30750.36s -> 30757.90s]  Oh, this is the the highlights. Let's read this. Tell me if you think this is funny.
[30758.70s -> 30762.82s]  I wrote down. Okay, so I remember the highlight stream thing that I wanted to do with the
[30762.90s -> 30770.86s]  highlights magazine. We got five to six pages of dot to dots. Five pages of Whales Where's Waldo.
[30771.90s -> 30775.34s]  Two to three hidden object pages. Two to three coloring pages. A joke section.
[30777.77s -> 30786.65s]  User submitted stories. Ads. What is ads here for? Two to three pages of ads. Was I making
[30786.65s -> 30800.25s]  a joke to myself later on that I would read later? That's weird. Gotta have ads apparently.
[30800.89s -> 30804.97s]  I don't know. I usually just write the first word. If it's a picture, I just say like, oh, it's a
[30806.25s -> 30812.89s]  let's say it's a picture of a dog like dog one. Oh, no, no, it's a this. It's a water slide slide.
[30813.45s -> 30818.65s]  I just and then they kind of use something to do slide and you write slide again and then it's
[30818.65s -> 30839.27s]  slide in parentheses two or slide parentheses one. But let's get the credits on here. Thanks for
[30839.27s -> 30849.16s]  watching guys. See you tomorrow. We will figure something out as we typically do. Here come all
[30849.16s -> 30862.82s]  of the subs. Thank you everybody. And there were a shitload of them. Resubs, community subs, gifted
[30862.82s -> 30877.53s]  subs, new subs, all of you. It's going by real fast. Yeah, good night everybody. We'll see you
[30877.53s -> 30888.30s]  tomorrow. There's still a couple bits left to do. We got future gamer thanks to 250. Did you hear
[30888.30s -> 30893.42s]  about the grasshopper pizza in retaliation to the Vegas invasion? Also, have you had any run ins
[30893.42s -> 30900.92s]  with the grasshoppers? They're everywhere. And for some weird reason, if you don't know, Las Vegas has
[30900.92s -> 30909.35s]  seen because we had such a wet spring. We had a lot of water here this past spring. So they were
[30909.35s -> 30914.15s]  able, I guess, to stop here or breed here or whatever the hell. I have no idea. But there's
[30914.79s -> 30922.15s]  millions everywhere. They're everywhere in every corner in every fucking place. Grasshoppers.
[30922.15s -> 30927.51s]  And for some weird reason, I don't know why they're like this. They're not scary. They don't bite.
[30928.07s -> 30938.63s]  They don't sting. They don't do anything bad. But they try to just fly into your face. I don't know
[30938.63s -> 30943.43s]  why. You'll open a door to leave somewhere and there'll be a couple that just jump right into
[30943.99s -> 30952.23s]  trying to get in your mouth. I don't know why they do that. You want to see something crazy?
[30952.23s -> 30957.75s]  You want to see some biblical crazy like conspiracy theory end of the world shit?
[30959.11s -> 30966.01s]  Go look up the picture of all the grasshoppers swarming the light at the Luxor.
[30966.01s -> 30973.13s]  Las Vegas has this big casino pyramid called the Luxor. It's a huge pyramid with a gigantic light
[30973.13s -> 30985.11s]  on top that beams into the stratosphere. You can see it from space. So already, like, wait,
[30985.11s -> 30989.27s]  why is there a pyramid with a giant light shooting at the sky? And now you've got grasshoppers
[30989.91s -> 30997.10s]  flying around it and inside of it. So you've got the pyramid light to the sky and the biblical,
[30997.98s -> 31006.33s]  I don't know what's going to happen. Biblical fucking grasshoppers, locusts in that pyramid.
[31006.33s -> 31023.98s]  Somebody's got it right here. Yeah. Look at that shit. That's nightmare fuel. Yeah, it is.
[31024.86s -> 31030.74s]  But it's been a lot but it's been okay. The last couple of days you see them still jumping around
[31030.74s -> 31044.31s]  but not like it was last week. But you know, whatever. I'll take grasshoppers. Yeah, you know,
[31044.31s -> 31051.03s]  I used to live in Massachusetts. I'll take plague biblical grasshoppers over one afternoon
[31051.83s -> 31064.31s]  around mosquitoes. Ever again. Just saying. But we have a couple more. We got an error list for
[31064.31s -> 31068.15s]  250 in all seriousness. Looking forward to September 21st and appreciate how much work
[31068.15s -> 31080.23s]  you put into all this. Hopefully it's worth it. I think it will be. Time will tell. It should be fun.
[31083.58s -> 31087.42s]  Wyrand thanks for the 250. Hey Jerma, I'm pretty involved in the community of the game called
[31087.42s -> 31093.66s]  Osu! and a little while ago a player mapped your song into the game and now it's a classic
[31094.30s -> 31097.90s]  in that scene and introduced a lot of people to you. Just thought it would be cool to tell
[31097.90s -> 31104.25s]  you if you haven't seen it. Is this the the rat song? I think we have seen this. Is this the rats?
[31105.05s -> 31124.49s]  We've yeah we've seen this one before. Yep. Wow, this is so cool. Yeah, I remember watching this
[31125.21s -> 31139.34s]  really late. I kind of want to play Osu! again. I've never played it. I don't know. I feel like
[31139.34s -> 31143.74s]  I would be kind of good at that game because if there's one thing that I know how to do well,
[31143.74s -> 31153.42s]  I have really good reaction speed. I do. I might not have very much of anything else,
[31153.42s -> 31166.89s]  but I know that I have really good like reaction times for stuff like that. Yeah, isn't it like a
[31166.89s -> 31181.70s]  Lycan game? Isn't Osu! essentially a Lycan rhythm game with your mouse? But here, I'll show it.
[31181.70s -> 31195.69s]  We'll skim through it. The rats song. Bring your own phone. Well, your own real phone
[31195.69s -> 31205.88s]  when you switch to Google Fi. Don't buy that. Don't buy that. Yeah, see it's like you got like
[31205.88s -> 31215.19s]  the mouse. I feel like I would be all right at this if I memorized it. I mean maybe not this good.
[31215.83s -> 31239.94s]  He's using a tablet. Holy shit. That's next level. Have they missed one time? Oh my god.
[31240.66s -> 31260.34s]  That's mesmerizing. Don't you feel like some of these people should go into surgery?
[31260.98s -> 31276.14s]  You know what I mean? Like that's like surgeon level of precision. If I was getting like an
[31276.14s -> 31286.15s]  operation and I got to pick one person that wasn't a doctor and had no medical background
[31286.15s -> 31307.53s]  to perform my surgery, I'd be like, can you get that Osu! guy down here?
[31307.53s -> 31312.41s]  There have been studies that non-gamer surgeons are much better at Super Monkey Ball than
[31313.13s -> 31332.50s]  other non-gamers. What? Did I read that wrong? No, I didn't. Did I? They don't have precision.
[31332.50s -> 31339.61s]  They have memory. Yeah, okay. So just let's say I was getting like a gallstone removed.
[31340.79s -> 31348.97s]  Make a song that was just the gallstone surgery and just tell them to do it. Give them the song.
[31348.97s -> 31352.25s]  Have them memorize it and do it really well. And it's just called gallstones.
[31354.28s -> 31358.92s]  And then I'll lie down on my back and you could just put the fucking gas on my mouth and
[31358.92s -> 31363.64s]  I'll then just play the song and let him do it. Just put a scalpel in his hand this time.
[31364.36s -> 31380.86s]  I'm of the belief that you got to be a little insane to want to be a surgeon and like cut
[31380.86s -> 31396.10s]  inside people. Surgeons love Super Monkey Ball. Why Super Monkey Ball? I don't understand.
[31396.98s -> 31404.60s]  I kind of think it's about the money. Yeah, I mean a good surgeon can make...
[31404.60s -> 31411.16s]  Well, I mean a good surgeon definitely can't make as much as a Minecraft YouTuber. So
[31411.96s -> 31429.08s]  just wait till all these surgeons figure out they can just play Minecraft.
[31429.64s -> 31448.57s]  How is he not open the link? I don't click links. Links freak me out.
[31449.53s -> 31455.96s]  Doctors put scalpel down for video game controllers. This is... What is this video?
[31470.54s -> 31474.94s]  And so that brought me to do three years of research on video games and how they
[31474.94s -> 31482.52s]  impact laparoscopic surgery. And that's what brought us here today. That video games can
[31482.52s -> 31494.46s]  help you be more efficient and also suppress errors in surgery. I can't handle this right now.
[31498.17s -> 31502.09s]  I can't handle this. I can't. It's too late. It's been nine hours. I gotta go to bed.
[31502.89s -> 31507.85s]  I can't watch surgeons play Super Monkey Ball right now. To me that's like going over the edge.
[31508.65s -> 31518.86s]  Am I going to Evo? I am might... I might be there on Sunday. I might show up on Sunday and just
[31518.86s -> 31530.47s]  kind of walk around with locusts. But thank you. Final bit from Stuff from Thing. Thanks for five
[31530.47s -> 31535.43s]  dollars. They say, Jeremy, I made this a few days ago and I wanted you to see... I wanted you to see
[31535.43s -> 31545.45s]  it. Love what you do. Oh, I did see this. This the fireman gift. It's really cute with the stretchy
[31545.45s -> 31553.82s]  legs. If I see you there can I have an autograph? No, I'm gonna be there in disguise. I'm gonna
[31553.82s -> 31558.06s]  have like the glasses and the mustache and just like with like a... I'm just gonna sit like in the
[31558.06s -> 31576.41s]  back with like a fucking hat on and like a mustache and shit. Let's play a look. All right. You want
[31576.41s -> 31583.40s]  to see? Look for the guy with the mustache. That's what I just told you but now it's a beard. Where
[31583.40s -> 31591.74s]  is he? I know Jeremy's wearing like a fake mustache. And now I'm gonna be like in a Master Chief
[31591.74s -> 31602.10s]  costume. Good luck. He's gonna be in a Master Chief costume. Spread that around. And now I'm
[31602.18s -> 31614.58s]  gonna be like dressed as like a night elf from Warcraft. Good luck. Five foot Master Chief.
[31615.22s -> 31623.14s]  You don't know how tall Master... Yeah, I'm sorry. There's a biography for Master Chief and it tells
[31623.14s -> 31644.76s]  his height. He's six feet tall. Whatever. He's not that tall. Master Chief is six feet tall.
[31645.32s -> 31659.26s]  That's not that huge for your huge super Master Chief guy. But that's it. I'll see you tomorrow.
[31659.82s -> 31665.91s]  Kind of a long one tonight but you know I've been gone for a while. So I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[31665.91s -> 31671.78s]  Same time, same place. Take care guys. Have a good one.
