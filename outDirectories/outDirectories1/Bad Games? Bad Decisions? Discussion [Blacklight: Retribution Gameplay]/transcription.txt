[0.31s -> 13.56s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.
[13.56s -> 19.26s]  Don't know exactly what's going to be in the background. This is going to be another one of my podcast-y styled type of videos
[19.26s -> 23.76s]  where there's just something random in the background, something to sit there for you to look at while I talk about some things.
[23.76s -> 29.56s]  And we do have something to talk about today. It's going to cover bad games.
[29.56s -> 33.76s]  And not just bad games, we're also going to cover bad company decisions,
[33.76s -> 42.26s]  whether it be marketing or their infrastructure techniques or release schedules, just bad decisions in general in the gaming world.
[42.26s -> 48.26s]  So let's add a few ground rules here. When I'm talking about bad games, I do not mean your brother or your friend saying,
[48.26s -> 52.76s]  oh you know that game Ice Climbers in like the 80s, I hated that frigging game, that game sucked.
[52.76s -> 61.26s]  I'm talking, no, I'm talking mostly about large quantities of people, large quantities of publications destroying a game,
[61.26s -> 66.26s]  saying that it was a complete atrocity, completely awful game and it was not even worth playing.
[66.26s -> 70.26s]  These are games that get like less than five on the ten point scale rating.
[70.26s -> 75.69s]  So with that kind of set as a ground rule, let's bring up a couple of releases in the last year or two
[75.69s -> 81.69s]  that have been really, really high budget releases, high touted games that got this type of bad rating.
[81.69s -> 86.69s]  I guess the most recent one you can think of, it just actually came out like this month,
[86.69s -> 90.69s]  Aliens Colonial Marines made by Gearbox Software.
[90.69s -> 95.69s]  This game was panned across the board, which is very, very odd because Gearbox,
[95.69s -> 101.69s]  the other guys responsible for Borderlands and Borderlands 2, which are fantastic games, awesome, awesome releases.
[101.69s -> 104.69s]  But I don't know where it went wrong with Colonial Marines.
[104.69s -> 109.69s]  I'm not sure why it turned out to be kind of a bad game and sort of lackluster in all the different regards,
[109.69s -> 114.86s]  but it did happen and one has to really wonder the investors and the sales,
[114.86s -> 117.86s]  that's probably going to be going down from this bad release.
[117.86s -> 121.86s]  What's going to happen to Gearbox now that this has been a thing?
[121.86s -> 125.86s]  And this is where I want to take the discussion forward here and talk about bad games
[125.86s -> 127.86s]  and the future of bad games and the future of companies.
[127.86s -> 132.86s]  Gaming is changing, but you can't make a bad game anymore.
[132.86s -> 137.86s]  You used to be able to make a bad game and it would still sell,
[137.86s -> 142.86s]  but at least in recent years, in the last like five or six years or so, you can't do that anymore.
[142.86s -> 147.86s]  There's so many people like myself and like a lot of other people on YouTube making videos about content.
[147.86s -> 150.86s]  Are they going to tell you don't buy that game? Are they going to tell you buy that game?
[150.86s -> 154.86s]  There's so many reviewing websites that tell you stay away from this game.
[154.86s -> 159.86s]  There's so many places where you can get information now that you can't just sloppily put together a bad game
[159.86s -> 162.36s]  and expect it to do well.
[162.36s -> 167.36s]  On the surface, this is a very good thing because obviously if you spend $60 on a game,
[167.36s -> 172.36s]  which is a lot of money, it's almost $100 to buy a new game now, at least on consoles.
[172.36s -> 176.36s]  So if you're going to spend that kind of money, you would expect to get an experience that,
[176.36s -> 179.36s]  let's face it, is at least not like a piece of absolute crap.
[179.36s -> 184.66s]  Now, don't get me wrong here. I have played and recommended games that have been,
[184.66s -> 187.66s]  let's say, lackluster in the review department.
[187.66s -> 191.66s]  I know a couple games that I've played recently have been very, very low-scoring games,
[191.66s -> 193.66s]  but they're also very cheap too.
[193.66s -> 197.66s]  And I think that correlates, there's a difference there between spending $10 on a game
[197.66s -> 201.66s]  rather than $60 on a game and potentially being disappointed.
[201.66s -> 206.66s]  But regardless of that, these companies that are not going to be making money off of you
[206.66s -> 209.66s]  and they had a $50 million budget or something like that,
[209.66s -> 212.66s]  they're going to lose a lot of money and they may in fact go under.
[212.66s -> 218.66s]  We have seen so many companies recently start to do a complete nosedive
[218.66s -> 223.66s]  because of poor sales, bad marketing decisions, bad gaming decisions,
[223.66s -> 227.66s]  and they end up crashing and burning very, very violently,
[227.66s -> 231.66s]  most notably THQ. Those guys don't even exist anymore.
[231.66s -> 235.66s]  All their IPs are being bought up by other companies and they're gone.
[235.66s -> 240.66s]  THQ was, I used to love that company way back in the day when they made the wrestling games,
[240.66s -> 245.66s]  not the new wrestling games, the ones like WCW Revenge, No Mercy.
[245.66s -> 247.66s]  I was a huge fan of those games in that series.
[247.66s -> 251.84s]  THQ is gone. They are completely gone.
[251.84s -> 254.84s]  And how crazy is that to say, they were a major gaming company,
[254.84s -> 258.84s]  a major huge development studios. It's insane.
[258.84s -> 261.84s]  And to know that that's capable of happening these days,
[261.84s -> 265.46s]  who's going to be left when it's all said and done?
[265.46s -> 268.46s]  All these people making these kind of mediocre type games,
[268.46s -> 271.46s]  these not so good, not so bad, maybe they suck, maybe they don't,
[271.46s -> 274.46s]  but they don't sell well or the decisions were bad when they were released.
[274.46s -> 279.46s]  Is it just going to be like EA and Valve or EA and Blizzard or something that are left?
[279.46s -> 284.46s]  Are they going to gobble up all these studios, all these independent studios, all these major studios?
[284.46s -> 287.46s]  We're going to see like a conglomerate in the future maybe?
[287.46s -> 289.46s]  Take a look at Nintendo.
[289.46s -> 297.46s]  Nintendo is on the brink of a complete sales disaster with the Wii U in January.
[297.46s -> 301.46s]  This is a statistic that is actually very shocking and I could not believe it when I heard it.
[301.46s -> 306.46s]  The Wii U sales in January are worse than any other month
[306.46s -> 312.46s]  in the history of every single Xbox 360 and PS3 month, all of them.
[312.46s -> 316.46s]  And those systems have been out for, oh my God, years.
[316.46s -> 319.46s]  They've been out for like five or six years.
[319.46s -> 322.46s]  I think the 360 even was seven years ago now.
[322.46s -> 324.46s]  Yeah, like 2005 is when it released.
[324.46s -> 330.46s]  The Wii U hasn't even been out for six months and it's already doing that poorly in sales?
[330.46s -> 333.46s]  Nintendo is probably very, very much concerned right now.
[333.46s -> 337.46s]  They're probably trying to think of ways to change things and maybe they, who knows?
[337.46s -> 339.46s]  Maybe this will turn them off from the hardware market.
[339.46s -> 340.46s]  I don't even know.
[340.46s -> 344.46s]  I mean, saying that statement is completely and totally, I have no base to that
[344.46s -> 350.46s]  because obviously Nintendo has like 700 million, trillion, billion dollars in their bank account.
[350.46s -> 351.46s]  So they're not going anywhere.
[351.46s -> 357.64s]  But it's interesting to think about because Sega, think about Sega, the Dreamcast, the last Sega system.
[357.64s -> 360.94s]  That turned out to be a complete and total failure.
[360.94s -> 365.94s]  And Sega went on to just make their games because they had iconic characters.
[365.94s -> 367.94s]  They had iconic franchises.
[367.94s -> 368.94s]  Think about this.
[368.94s -> 374.94s]  Think about Mario being on the PS4 and the Xbox 720 if that's exactly what those names are going to be.
[374.94s -> 381.31s]  But it could happen and it's because of these poor decisions that companies make
[381.31s -> 383.31s]  and that's tying it all back to the bad games.
[383.31s -> 387.31s]  And now the Wii U might have some great games, but there's not very many of them.
[387.31s -> 393.31s]  And poor marketing decisions on Nintendo's part probably has led to this almost, almost flop.
[393.31s -> 396.31s]  I don't want to call it a flop yet because that could be completely untrue.
[396.31s -> 401.31s]  But three or four months into a product's release at the caliber that Nintendo is used to,
[401.31s -> 404.49s]  this is a pretty dire situation right now.
[404.49s -> 407.92s]  But as always, please let me know what you think in the comments section.
[407.92s -> 409.92s]  Let's keep the discussion going.
[409.92s -> 410.92s]  I'm sure a lot of people are going to want to hear.
[410.92s -> 413.92s]  A lot of people are going to have a lot of opinions on this and I'm glad to see them.
[413.92s -> 415.92s]  So thank you so much for watching everybody.
[415.92s -> 418.92s]  That's going to wrap up the video and I'll see you all next time.
[418.92s -> 421.92s]  And of course, take care everybody.
