[0.57s -> 8.04s]  but that would be that would be you lying. You understand? Dude, the two best things at
[8.04s -> 14.84s]  BlizzCon were World of Warcraft Classic, something they did more than a decade ago,
[15.56s -> 24.92s]  and Warcraft 3 remastered a 16 year old game. And the third best thing is that Mike Morheim
[24.92s -> 31.00s]  stepped down before the company turned into a dogshit show. Oh my god. Dude, the mic is hot,
[31.00s -> 39.91s]  man. The mic is hot. You got a hot mic. What the fuck? Oh, dude. Everybody's already
[39.91s -> 55.90s]  saying that. Oh my god. Somebody says hot bod. No, hot mic. Oh, hi guys. You know who this is.
[55.90s -> 64.58s]  Sometimes it really be like that. Yeah, well, we're not playing a Blizzard game right now.
[64.58s -> 71.62s]  We're playing another game. You know how when you're a sweaty tryhard and you get like
[71.62s -> 78.26s]  gamer gunk on your controller. Oh, I know that. Tell me about it, man. I have about three inches
[78.26s -> 83.70s]  of gunk on this controller from all the Soul Calibur I've played. It is disgusting. I mean,
[83.70s -> 86.98s]  at what point do you just put that underwater and like shake it around with like soap and
[86.98s -> 91.14s]  stuff? Well, I stopped using it because I got a different one. But now that I like,
[91.14s -> 93.94s]  because I have to use this one for Lethal League, I've gone back to it and it's like,
[93.94s -> 103.45s]  wow. I think I could spread a disease. I think this could be ground zero. Oh my god.
[105.29s -> 110.01s]  What even is gamer gunk? Like, it's disgusting. Is it like sweat that just cakes on over like
[110.01s -> 119.72s]  years of time? Years? This took a few days. Yeah, but it wasn't, you didn't have gamer like
[119.72s -> 127.34s]  that. That was like years. These are my excretions. I like shake your hand. I don't
[127.34s -> 133.43s]  like that. Well, you know what? If we shook hands for like a day, you'd get all my excretions.
[135.88s -> 144.41s]  But I think one shake isn't enough. Did you make a tweet yet? I don't tweet anything. You
[144.41s -> 147.69s]  don't have a tweet yet about your story? I should, honestly, because I've people have
[147.69s -> 151.29s]  been asking me like every time I look at my chat for the past week and I said,
[151.29s -> 159.14s]  do you know Lethal League? Well, apparently you are stet abs. Lethal League with stet abs
[159.14s -> 164.26s]  then maybe Fred dead too. I don't, I auto, I don't know what happened.
[165.77s -> 171.72s]  Lethal League with stet abs. I don't understand. Well, then you're going to be germ bad.
[175.13s -> 179.30s]  All right. Let's move this over here. Are you like, do you even do like an intro anymore?
[179.30s -> 185.59s]  Or do you just say like, who cares play? What is, what is, what is it like now? Like,
[185.59s -> 198.38s]  how are you? Um, I gave up a long time ago. Let's go this way. Okay. Hey everybody. Welcome
[198.38s -> 202.22s]  to the stream for another edition of wacky Wednesday, where we check out the latest
[202.22s -> 213.94s]  goofiest games today. Lethal League. And boy is this one wacky. Oh, I burnt my mouth. Oh,
[213.94s -> 220.58s]  okay. Are you ready? So I, how do you, I remember we just did like, we did a test.
[221.22s -> 227.06s]  We did a test to make sure it works, you know, we did, we did it. And then you left the game
[227.06s -> 231.06s]  and I have to do it again. No, you're like, yeah. Like, are you, are you ready? Are you in
[231.06s -> 235.70s]  the game? I'm ready. I'm ready to be joined. So you should, should I give like a rundown of
[235.70s -> 243.35s]  what Lethal League is? You know what? Go for it. Tommy Pickles. Okay. So Lethal League
[244.15s -> 249.27s]  is a series of back and forth. It's a never ending struggle between two forces.
[249.27s -> 255.91s]  You've got the red team versus the blue team. Well, nobody dies here. Everyone lives. It's
[255.91s -> 261.05s]  just a game of back and forth and never ending struggle ball. You got blue team versus red
[261.05s -> 266.57s]  team. I'm on the blue team. He's on the red team. And there's a ball that signifies
[267.53s -> 273.05s]  a spherical entity and it goes back and forth between the two never end. Just press
[273.05s -> 279.61s]  press. I was waiting for the story. Okay. So there was, there is no story. I like it's called.
[279.61s -> 287.61s]  I just woke up. You wake up at 3pm. No, wait, no, wait. It's 1 30. I didn't just wake up.
[287.61s -> 292.01s]  Okay. I don't know how time zones work. Also you drink hot coffee in the desert.
[293.35s -> 300.63s]  Yeah. What's wrong with that? You don't drink iced coffee. I look, it's you save money. I
[300.63s -> 303.67s]  play ping pong. You save money. If you drink, if you make your own coffee, like I used to
[303.67s -> 308.71s]  drink a Dunkin Donuts every day. Good. Keep doing that. By the way, if you guys didn't know
[308.71s -> 314.07s]  what this game was the back and forth between two struggling places and whoever gets hit
[314.07s -> 319.85s]  first is the one that gets their health taken away. Hey, you're not going to get that one.
[319.85s -> 326.42s]  I'm sorry. It's about, it's about two struggling forces. It's so confusing when it's that fast
[326.42s -> 331.62s]  and you can also make it go through walls. Yeah. So everyone's got it. You've got a
[331.62s -> 338.15s]  special ability. Uh, his special ability is being a fucking cheater. What's that?
[338.15s -> 343.72s]  Is that a smash ball? Smash ball. It's a smash ball. Oh yeah. They edit power-ups.
[343.72s -> 351.37s]  What the fuck? I don't know what that is. What does that do? Oh, oh, oh, oh my God.
[356.33s -> 360.33s]  I don't understand what it's doing. It's, it's your superpower where it's going through walls
[361.05s -> 369.88s]  and now you know how confusing it is. Jesus Christ. I hate that ability.
[371.40s -> 376.84s]  What even, what is your, wow. Mine like curbs it and it's, it's not, it's not anything.
[376.84s -> 382.84s]  What, what, what does yours do? Like just that maybe curbs it. Show it to me. Show
[382.84s -> 386.52s]  people what that was. That was best special in the game. What are you talking about?
[387.48s -> 404.50s]  Ow. Oh, he's reading the summary of the load of the rings. Fuck one to find them. One to
[404.50s -> 415.24s]  bind them and one to shine them. The speed of the ball affects like hit damage. Oh fuck. Oh
[415.24s -> 420.78s]  my God. Oh my God. Oh yeah. And you can hit the people's dead bodies. Very important.
[421.50s -> 425.58s]  Oh, that's right. Oh my God. But like, but just for real though, if you don't know
[425.58s -> 439.82s]  what this game is, it's a red versus blue scenario where I'm playing by myself. Oh,
[442.62s -> 447.98s]  red, red communist China. That's why my ping pong pad. Wait, did you win? Yeah. I killed
[447.98s -> 451.50s]  you. All right. Now that we can explain what the game is. So if you don't know what the
[451.50s -> 459.50s]  game is for the next hour, I just felt fucking caught. I just got this fucking room. I just
[459.50s -> 465.26s]  got this room and I spilled coffee all over it. God damn it. Well, did it get on like
[465.26s -> 472.07s]  the nice walnut desk? Oh no, I'm good. We're good. He only lost because he spilled his
[472.07s -> 481.80s]  coffee. Who are these other characters? Should I be, should I be crocodile Dundee?
[482.44s -> 486.52s]  You still like crocodile Dundee. Did I? What is this special? I don't remember,
[486.52s -> 492.34s]  but I know he can, he can hang on the walls. Oh shit. It did get on the desk. Hold
[492.34s -> 494.98s]  on. I have a, I have a coaster here specifically for this. Oh, I got to take
[494.98s -> 501.61s]  my shirt off. Oh my God. Is this a web cam shirt off Jerma Stream? No shirt. No,
[501.61s -> 506.97s]  it's called, it's, it's called really like I spilled on my walnut desk. How much did
[506.97s -> 514.42s]  you pay for your walnut desk? It was at least like $400. It's a beautiful walnut
[514.42s -> 521.26s]  desk. I don't, don't swing that at me. I'll know you're going to do it. Okay.
[521.26s -> 524.30s]  That's good. I can put it back on the coaster. I'm not going to wash this again
[524.30s -> 530.87s]  later. I'm going to wash it. Okay. Now I got coffee all over me. I'll give me
[530.87s -> 538.44s]  one more second. You know, it's enough to fighting nations. Oh yeah. He like eats
[538.44s -> 551.48s]  it. His is really good too. Oh, I just heard you. I just heard you being me.
[552.44s -> 573.80s]  You're going to die, dude. I had my catcher's mid out. Oh my God. What was
[573.80s -> 577.96s]  that? You got double hit by it. We, uh, if you attack at the same time,
[578.04s -> 583.88s]  sometimes you, uh, you're like double hit it. What did I say? Nice for,
[583.88s -> 585.72s]  Oh, there's an emo button. I don't remember what it is.
[592.66s -> 602.79s]  Ooh, nice throw. Oh, I thought I had it. Tommy Pickles burst five. Whoa. That was
[602.79s -> 614.23s]  weird. That was a weird one. That is so strange when you do that. Oh my God.
[620.76s -> 625.99s]  Wow. What's the button? It's, I don't know. I want that to be my thing on my
[625.99s -> 632.79s]  screen. I'm not going to tell you. You always were a freaking selfish lover.
[637.94s -> 641.26s]  Oh my God. You've been practicing.
[645.74s -> 651.83s]  Wouldn't it be cool if Blizzard like announced this game instead of Diablo
[651.83s -> 658.62s]  Immortal and then lethal league blaze had a player base. Well, another funny
[658.62s -> 661.74s]  joke you could make is if Val bought this company and then put it out again.
[662.98s -> 666.18s]  What happened to PC gaming? What happened to it? Dude, I was saying this the other
[666.18s -> 673.38s]  day, um, 2019 and beyond get ready for the weird times where Val is going to
[673.38s -> 677.48s]  start releasing better games than Blizzard. It's about to happen. You
[677.48s -> 681.56s]  heard it. This is a new character. I'll try this character. Uh, I messed
[681.56s -> 684.84s]  with her in training. She like, she puts the ball in a bubble and slows
[684.84s -> 688.84s]  it down and then it, when it wears off, it speeds up again. Oh, that's
[688.84s -> 695.05s]  cool. Oh, for those of you, for those of you, German might on the German side
[695.05s -> 697.45s]  here, uh, we're going to be, uh, I got, I got a couple of bounces for you
[697.45s -> 701.29s]  here after playing lethal league. I'm going to give you some updates on the
[701.29s -> 703.45s]  green screen. Those of you, German might sit here in the German channel.
[706.20s -> 710.36s]  What the hell? Yeah, it's okay. It does a weird slow thing. It has like
[710.36s -> 719.29s]  three phases to it. Wow. Okay. That's pretty cool. I got it. I got it. I
[720.09s -> 727.29s]  got it. I got it. Why did I just do, I, I got it. I, I got it. I got it.
[731.08s -> 741.24s]  That just was, Ooh, that throw was actually pretty nifty. Oh, how did you
[741.24s -> 750.94s]  catch that? I just went the wrong way. I swung the wrong way. Did I hit
[750.94s -> 764.76s]  by that? Yeah. Oh, smash ball. What the heck? Come on. Give it to me.
[765.64s -> 773.54s]  Ooh, just homing missile it in. I'm Satan. I'm Satan. I don't know. What
[773.54s -> 777.38s]  does it do? I don't know. I think I'm Satan. Is it? Oh, I think it
[777.38s -> 782.02s]  changes too. What the fuck? Yeah, that's actually pretty stupid. I
[782.02s -> 785.06s]  thought it was a really dumb power, but once you get that fast.
[789.50s -> 795.90s]  No, it's my ball. What am I doing? Like cast. I'm like throwing confetti
[795.90s -> 801.67s]  at you. What the fuck am I doing? You're dying. Oh God. Not for long.
[803.35s -> 810.78s]  All right. Let's bring this to the stratosphere. Oh my God. Oh my God.
[814.54s -> 817.42s]  Some of this I saw in the sewer stage. If you get the ball a certain
[817.42s -> 819.98s]  speed, like a monster comes out of the sewer in the background.
[819.98s -> 823.58s]  Oh really? That's pretty cool. Oh my fucking God. That was the
[823.58s -> 839.32s]  easiest thing ever. I just lost it. Whoa. I'm doing it. I'm doing
[839.32s -> 847.21s]  it the wrong way every time. Fucking God damn it. I'm a football
[847.21s -> 853.67s]  player. Oh, that's weird. Oh my God. That's real weird.
[859.11s -> 875.19s]  I don't like that. Watch out. Oh, I don't know where it is. These
[875.19s -> 885.90s]  old man eyes. I think, I think for the, the sake of how things
[885.90s -> 888.78s]  used to be back in the good old days, the old stir, the old
[888.78s -> 895.82s]  German, I think we have to make a bet. Oh no. If you win,
[895.82s -> 907.42s]  I'll stop DDoSing you. Oh my God. That's like.
[913.54s -> 919.88s]  That's like, that's too close to home here right now. I want to
[919.88s -> 925.29s]  be the yellow guy. What about if I win? You just, no. Okay.
[926.33s -> 931.70s]  All right. If you, let's go to the, the pad room. Give me,
[931.70s -> 933.30s]  give me like a round of think about that. Cause you just,
[933.38s -> 937.22s]  you just gave me like an impossible scenario. No, it's
[937.22s -> 941.70s]  not. We have to get like five warmup rounds. You gotta learn
[941.70s -> 947.11s]  the game. Actually like on second thought. Oh, I mean,
[947.11s -> 951.96s]  yeah. Like we shouldn't do it this time. Why would you
[951.96s -> 954.12s]  stand in front of it? I'm dying. You need to stand in
[954.12s -> 956.92s]  front of it. Hold on. I'm dying. You don't even on
[956.92s -> 958.52s]  second thought. If I win.
[958.52s -> 965.96s]  Okay. This game requires so much concentration. Like there
[965.96s -> 969.08s]  is no like funny commentary. No, there is. Well, what's a
[969.08s -> 975.94s]  funny commentary? Yeah. The funny commentary is I think it
[975.94s -> 977.86s]  has made so much noise that I just shook the balls.
[979.46s -> 982.26s]  Oh, here it comes. Here it comes. Oh, fuck me. Oh,
[982.26s -> 1006.47s]  fuck me. No, no, no. Cause it hit the wall. It goes up
[1006.47s -> 1008.95s]  and down when it hits the wall. This is the scariest game
[1008.95s -> 1021.91s]  ever. It really is. It was like that before too. Oh,
[1021.91s -> 1029.93s]  no. Are you trying to hit me? No, I was trying to hit
[1029.93s -> 1037.69s]  it right when it came out. All right. We got just a
[1037.69s -> 1041.61s]  stand over there. Ow. Ow. All right. Well, I didn't want
[1041.61s -> 1044.65s]  you to hit twice. Go all the way to the edge. Let's
[1044.65s -> 1046.81s]  try to get the monster to break through. Oh, no,
[1046.81s -> 1050.17s]  that was only on the sewer. What? I don't know if the
[1050.17s -> 1055.82s]  other stages have anything like that. I'm trying to
[1055.82s -> 1058.70s]  speed it up. Oh, my fucking God. All right. We just
[1058.70s -> 1060.38s]  replay. Forget it. Let's give you a free kill.
[1065.34s -> 1082.42s]  Hey. Shit. Shit. I can. I can tea bag you. Very
[1082.42s -> 1087.35s]  good game. So let's explain the game. So pretty
[1087.35s -> 1089.99s]  much how it works. So you got two sides, right? You've
[1089.99s -> 1093.03s]  got red team versus blue team. And it's a red team's
[1093.03s -> 1096.23s]  goal to hit the blue team's player with this
[1096.23s -> 1099.19s]  spherical entity. It's a it's a it's a it's a big
[1099.19s -> 1104.63s]  it's a it's a large circle that there's probably
[1104.63s -> 1108.87s]  an easier word to say, but it becomes away from
[1108.87s -> 1113.03s]  me right now. It goes back and forth at pixels
[1113.03s -> 1114.79s]  on the screen and you have to try to hit the
[1114.79s -> 1120.31s]  other person's team with that. The protractor
[1120.31s -> 1122.23s]  when you when you take a protractor and you go
[1122.23s -> 1125.27s]  around in the circle with the I just said circles
[1125.27s -> 1131.30s]  and remind the joke is over. I don't that was
[1131.30s -> 1134.26s]  a joke. No, I was trying to not say the
[1134.26s -> 1136.98s]  fucking word ball or sir. I don't even know
[1136.98s -> 1138.26s]  what I was trying to say. I can't you
[1138.26s -> 1140.18s]  understand. It's like being speech jammed trying
[1140.18s -> 1147.29s]  to play this. No, I don't. I don't. I was
[1147.29s -> 1148.97s]  going for something and it just it just wasn't
[1149.05s -> 1160.25s]  going to work out. I summoned the monster. I
[1160.25s -> 1163.21s]  didn't see it. How did you not see that? Oh
[1163.21s -> 1164.49s]  because I was focused. You didn't see the
[1164.49s -> 1173.35s]  monster. Really? I was going to grab that
[1173.35s -> 1184.01s]  shit. You wish you grabbed it. Take this.
[1184.01s -> 1193.51s]  Sure. Holy fucking hell. He didn't come out
[1193.51s -> 1195.75s]  that time. He's he's picking up a little
[1195.75s -> 1200.89s]  bit. Oh, that was a good play. Oh, that
[1200.97s -> 1205.58s]  was a bad play. And that ability is a rough
[1205.58s -> 1217.82s]  one. Oops. The germamites. Haha. Ban that
[1217.82s -> 1221.26s]  guy for life by the way. I don't want to
[1221.26s -> 1231.94s]  die. Alright, so if hey how about instead
[1231.94s -> 1235.06s]  of like jokey like stick the knife in
[1235.06s -> 1238.02s]  and twist it jokes. Yeah. What do you
[1238.02s -> 1244.49s]  actually want to do here? I don't know. I
[1244.49s -> 1245.93s]  think everything in your life has lost
[1245.93s -> 1248.76s]  value to you. There's nothing I could
[1248.84s -> 1252.39s]  offer you that you don't already have.
[1252.39s -> 1256.47s]  You're such a big germa now. High in the
[1256.47s -> 1258.55s]  clouds with his head and his ego. What
[1258.55s -> 1259.83s]  can I possibly offer?
[1264.44s -> 1267.34s]  How about that? You know, I got a new
[1267.34s -> 1269.34s]  place. You know what I could use right
[1269.34s -> 1271.75s]  now? I could use some new curtains
[1271.75s -> 1276.20s]  here. New place. Yeah, why don't you
[1276.20s -> 1277.64s]  have your real friend italics get
[1277.64s -> 1280.76s]  them. Hey, you got a new place too.
[1280.76s -> 1282.20s]  Don't you need some new curtains?
[1283.59s -> 1290.68s]  But perhaps. But is this the curtain
[1290.68s -> 1302.34s]  battle? Yes. Okay. Okay. Yep. See he I
[1302.34s -> 1303.94s]  the candy man said yep like four times.
[1303.94s -> 1307.46s]  I thought you heard it. Yep. You're
[1307.46s -> 1325.66s]  cheating. Nice throw. The thing that's
[1325.66s -> 1328.14s]  different this time is both terrible.
[1338.23s -> 1342.87s]  I tried to grab that shit. Oh, you
[1342.87s -> 1344.23s]  fucking lobbed it over at me. You
[1344.23s -> 1357.38s]  fucking lobbed it over at me. I keep
[1357.38s -> 1366.42s]  doing that. Not this bullshit. I
[1366.42s -> 1367.46s]  remember this shit from last time we
[1367.46s -> 1368.66s]  played. You like then you then you
[1368.66s -> 1369.94s]  get out of the way. I remember that.
[1370.98s -> 1382.25s]  Come get it. That slowed down so much.
[1384.44s -> 1395.11s]  Why? Oh my fucking lord. What am I
[1395.11s -> 1405.96s]  thinking? What am I thinking? Oh my
[1405.96s -> 1410.34s]  god. So is that is that one curtain?
[1410.34s -> 1412.26s]  Two curtains a set? You get you get
[1412.26s -> 1416.22s]  one side. Okay. One side. What does
[1416.22s -> 1418.06s]  that mean? Did get one side. Yeah, but
[1418.06s -> 1419.42s]  you get a double window. That's one
[1419.42s -> 1421.02s]  curtain for one side. One of the double
[1421.02s -> 1424.62s]  windows. You always wear a cheapskate.
[1424.62s -> 1435.67s]  I want to summon the guy. So let's go
[1435.67s -> 1438.68s]  to the wait this one here? Yeah. Is
[1438.68s -> 1441.64s]  it this one? Yeah. No, not this one.
[1442.62s -> 1443.90s]  Well, it's too late. So you get
[1443.90s -> 1453.50s]  one side of one curtain. Oh my
[1453.50s -> 1457.91s]  lord. Aye yi yi yi yi.
[1462.76s -> 1473.86s]  Can I get can I get? Oh, I just got
[1473.86s -> 1475.46s]  mortal combatted. I just swept your
[1475.54s -> 1478.25s]  leg over and over again. I really stood
[1478.25s -> 1479.85s]  up into it three times. I don't know how
[1479.85s -> 1493.64s]  you control standing up in this.
[1493.64s -> 1502.15s]  Catch it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
[1502.15s -> 1512.01s]  Nice. Stop it. What's happening here?
[1512.65s -> 1516.06s]  You're a bull hog. I was just waiting
[1516.06s -> 1517.26s]  on this side like it'll come here
[1517.26s -> 1517.82s]  eventually.
[1528.18s -> 1530.26s]  What the fuck am I doing? What's the
[1530.26s -> 1531.70s]  taunt button? I don't know, but you
[1531.70s -> 1532.50s]  better stop pressing it.
[1532.50s -> 1538.87s]  It's too fast. I can't get it.
[1556.98s -> 1564.15s]  I don't like this game. Get him.
[1574.31s -> 1579.26s]  He just ayah. That makes me so happy.
[1580.62s -> 1585.51s]  Is it ayah? Yeah. Why does that
[1585.51s -> 1587.27s]  make you happy? Because that's
[1587.27s -> 1588.87s]  that's what all the old Chinese men
[1588.87s -> 1590.55s]  play say during ping pong.
[1593.14s -> 1596.09s]  Is it? Yes. That's why we play
[1597.05s -> 1599.53s]  ping pong. I played like a week
[1599.53s -> 1600.65s]  after I moved here and it's been a
[1600.65s -> 1602.73s]  while though. I haven't gone back.
[1603.45s -> 1605.77s]  My chat knows that I showed up. I
[1605.77s -> 1607.93s]  paid five hundred dollars for a year
[1607.93s -> 1609.29s]  membership and never came back.
[1610.09s -> 1614.36s]  Well, you sure you sure sound like
[1614.36s -> 1615.08s]  you know what the fuck you're
[1615.08s -> 1615.64s]  talking about.
[1616.98s -> 1618.74s]  Like press mute here. Let's mute it.
[1619.38s -> 1625.32s]  No, we fucking don't. Wait,
[1625.32s -> 1626.92s]  there's a store? What?
[1627.96s -> 1631.30s]  There's a store in this? I think
[1631.78s -> 1638.10s]  you can buy characters. I caught
[1638.10s -> 1642.18s]  that one on the edge. Oh, I thought
[1642.18s -> 1644.42s]  I timed that right. What a bunt boy.
[1647.75s -> 1664.58s]  Damn it. Oh, did I catch it?
[1664.58s -> 1666.98s]  Yeah, I did. Oh, God, I hate that.
[1666.98s -> 1668.10s]  Oh, my God, I got caught it. I
[1668.10s -> 1670.50s]  thought I thought I got hit. I got
[1670.50s -> 1675.03s]  hit. Oh, you did. You did get hit.
[1679.46s -> 1681.80s]  No. Oh, I thought you did get
[1681.80s -> 1683.24s]  hit by it. Sometimes your
[1683.24s -> 1684.12s]  character does this thing where he
[1684.12s -> 1685.08s]  crunches forward and looks like
[1685.08s -> 1690.31s]  it's hit. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes
[1690.31s -> 1697.11s]  it'd be like that. You have fun
[1697.11s -> 1700.46s]  over there. What? How did that
[1700.46s -> 1711.75s]  hit me? Oh, oh, you don't know
[1711.75s -> 1712.87s]  nothing about curving the ball
[1712.87s -> 1718.14s]  and spin. Oh, you don't know
[1718.14s -> 1720.46s]  nothing about spin. That bounced
[1720.46s -> 1730.92s]  around. I thought I turned. I
[1730.92s -> 1749.48s]  turned. I turned around. That was
[1749.48s -> 1753.08s]  bullshit. What the hell was that?
[1755.00s -> 1757.54s]  I wish the other boys unlocked.
[1757.54s -> 1759.06s]  They have like the giant boombox
[1759.06s -> 1762.31s]  boss you could play as. I think
[1762.31s -> 1763.43s]  yeah, you get like currency
[1763.43s -> 1764.31s]  though, don't you? There's some
[1764.31s -> 1765.91s]  kind of currency thing. Dude, I
[1765.91s -> 1768.87s]  don't know. I'm going to go try
[1768.87s -> 1769.67s]  somebody else. I'm going to try
[1769.67s -> 1773.03s]  skateboard man. I've been playing
[1773.03s -> 1776.71s]  him a lot. Like we can unlock
[1776.71s -> 1778.63s]  different modes in the store
[1778.63s -> 1779.83s]  apparently. Oh, yeah. Remember
[1779.83s -> 1784.52s]  there was a big ball mode. Oh,
[1784.52s -> 1785.72s]  was there? Yeah, there was a
[1785.72s -> 1788.20s]  giant ball mode. My stream labs
[1788.20s -> 1789.24s]  has been turned off this whole
[1789.24s -> 1790.44s]  time. It's like I don't even know
[1790.44s -> 1792.84s]  how to fucking stream. Your what
[1792.84s -> 1794.20s]  was turned off? Sorry about my
[1794.20s -> 1796.84s]  stream labs. Oh, what is this
[1796.84s -> 1797.88s]  special movie? Skateboards
[1797.88s -> 1808.55s]  around. I don't remember. What are
[1808.55s -> 1811.70s]  these days? I'll get it. Oops.
[1811.70s -> 1825.62s]  Brain. Kick flip. Kick flip. Damn
[1825.62s -> 1834.04s]  that. Oh my God. When you all just
[1834.04s -> 1835.48s]  like jump around like idiots.
[1840.95s -> 1846.15s]  Wait, what is that? Hold on a
[1846.15s -> 1849.88s]  second. That's a different move.
[1849.88s -> 1852.28s]  One of them is throw probably. No,
[1852.28s -> 1853.48s]  okay. That's just different move
[1853.48s -> 1854.92s]  for a bunt for a second. I was
[1854.92s -> 1855.72s]  like, what the hell is it? Left
[1855.72s -> 1858.28s]  trigger. No, there's anything else
[1858.28s -> 1859.08s]  do anything. Are we missing
[1859.08s -> 1860.36s]  something like that? Like I'm
[1860.36s -> 1861.48s]  trying to figure out what game
[1861.48s -> 1862.44s]  and he just loves the ball.
[1862.44s -> 1863.96s]  Bunt hit throw in your special.
[1863.96s -> 1874.30s]  That's it. What? That hit me. Yeah,
[1874.30s -> 1879.19s]  nice internet man. My internet. Yeah,
[1879.19s -> 1881.03s]  I know it's not good. Well, no, no,
[1881.03s -> 1882.23s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1882.23s -> 1883.59s]  that's not true. The internet is fine
[1883.59s -> 1885.19s]  here. It's a great internet. Great
[1885.19s -> 1887.27s]  speeds, fast speeds. It's just the
[1887.27s -> 1889.27s]  company that makes it. Well, they
[1889.27s -> 1890.47s]  don't make the internet. Nobody makes
[1890.47s -> 1891.59s]  the internet. It's like just data
[1891.59s -> 1893.83s]  that travels through tubes. But the
[1893.83s -> 1895.19s]  company that's responsible for moving
[1895.19s -> 1897.75s]  the traffic, the internet traffic is
[1897.75s -> 1898.95s]  having a little bit of a problem
[1898.95s -> 1901.35s]  right now as you can plainly see.
[1901.35s -> 1903.51s]  It's not good. There we've been
[1903.51s -> 1904.47s]  informed that it is going to get
[1904.47s -> 1906.39s]  fixed and maybe soon enough here you
[1906.39s -> 1907.67s]  will. You'll see it and I just
[1907.67s -> 1909.75s]  fucking won the goddamn game. I did
[1909.75s -> 1914.49s]  great thing. I swung in the opposite
[1914.49s -> 1916.17s]  direction on every ball
[1916.17s -> 1917.37s]  because I won the last two in a row.
[1917.37s -> 1918.81s]  Do I delete your curtains that I
[1918.81s -> 1920.09s]  gave you and then I just never
[1920.09s -> 1921.53s]  agreed to another deal? No, you
[1921.53s -> 1924.70s]  never agreed because we're going to
[1924.70s -> 1925.50s]  agree that I'm going to go to my
[1925.50s -> 1929.59s]  main.
[1929.59s -> 1930.47s]  All right, let's do let's do one
[1930.47s -> 1931.43s]  more and see if we can like get
[1931.43s -> 1932.63s]  another game mode.
[1932.63s -> 1936.06s]  Okay, like how much is another
[1936.06s -> 1938.30s]  character?
[1938.30s -> 1939.26s]  I think you might have to go
[1939.26s -> 1940.62s]  through the story mode to unlock
[1940.62s -> 1942.22s]  characters.
[1942.22s -> 1949.11s]  Oh, really? I don't know. This one.
[1949.11s -> 1952.52s]  No, I want to ready up. X. I tried to
[1952.52s -> 1953.96s]  click the ready button.
[1953.96s -> 1958.92s]  It's X. It's not X.
[1958.92s -> 1963.50s]  Okay, well never mind. You're X. It's
[1963.50s -> 1964.38s]  one thousand.
[1964.38s -> 1965.98s]  You buy characters with the sparks
[1965.98s -> 1969.27s]  you earn while playing the game.
[1969.27s -> 1972.25s]  It's a thousand bucks. So we're
[1972.25s -> 1973.77s]  almost there. We've played like 30
[1973.77s -> 1975.21s]  minutes.
[1975.21s -> 1979.02s]  A thousand bucks DLC. Oh, you don't
[1979.02s -> 1987.35s]  know nothing about the spin.
[1987.35s -> 1991.03s]  Oh, look at those omnics in the
[1991.03s -> 1993.42s]  background.
[1993.42s -> 1995.50s]  Oh, speaking of overwatch. So what do
[1995.50s -> 1997.26s]  you think about the new character?
[1997.26s -> 1998.70s]  I think it's just McCree without his
[1998.70s -> 1999.98s]  flashbang, which is how he should have
[1999.98s -> 2001.42s]  been originally.
[2001.42s -> 2008.38s]  Oh, you don't know. Not this time.
[2008.38s -> 2009.42s]  You're not going to go backwards
[2009.42s -> 2011.02s]  on me this time.
[2011.02s -> 2013.58s]  Oh, I don't know if I like this
[2013.58s -> 2014.78s]  character. It's the character. It's the
[2014.78s -> 2017.34s]  fucking character.
[2017.42s -> 2023.61s]  Oh, that's the character. No, the
[2023.61s -> 2025.37s]  character. This mallet's too heavy.
[2025.37s -> 2026.97s]  Yeah, the heavy. The mallet's just
[2026.97s -> 2029.77s]  really heavy. It's just heavy. It's slow.
[2029.77s -> 2039.26s]  And uh. Oh, please.
[2039.26s -> 2040.54s]  That's just. That's the mallet's a
[2040.54s -> 2042.38s]  little too big for me.
[2042.38s -> 2044.74s]  No, I mean. What if I. People are
[2044.74s -> 2046.50s]  going to take that. I'm going to.
[2046.50s -> 2051.37s]  Maybe we're going to like take that.
[2051.37s -> 2052.73s]  Like that's not what I meant. Like
[2052.73s -> 2056.81s]  people are going to take that.
[2056.81s -> 2059.51s]  So how often do you itch your nose?
[2059.51s -> 2062.23s]  Oh, do I itch my nose? Yeah. I don't
[2062.23s -> 2063.75s]  know. Maybe once every.
[2063.75s -> 2066.47s]  All right. Or wipe your nose.
[2066.47s -> 2068.55s]  Whoops. I quit. The host has quit the
[2068.55s -> 2069.99s]  game. All right. Well, fine. That's fine.
[2069.99s -> 2072.07s]  All right. So let's go to.
[2072.07s -> 2075.82s]  What is showcase? Characters. Oh, we're
[2075.82s -> 2078.54s]  like. We're like one coin away from
[2078.54s -> 2079.82s]  being able to get one.
[2079.82s -> 2081.82s]  How come I don't have 985? That
[2081.82s -> 2084.76s]  would have been perfect.
[2084.76s -> 2086.44s]  Okay. Well. And the modes cost like
[2086.44s -> 2088.55s]  400.
[2088.55s -> 2090.79s]  Okay. Free for all teams. Lethal
[2090.79s -> 2091.99s]  volley.
[2091.99s -> 2095.77s]  Oh, okay. This is cool. This is uh.
[2095.77s -> 2097.93s]  It's like tennis or like ping-pong.
[2097.93s -> 2100.33s]  Oh, dude. Leave the volleys ping-pong.
[2100.33s -> 2102.25s]  You know that. You know that. I'll buy
[2102.25s -> 2103.05s]  that.
[2103.05s -> 2104.57s]  And then because I'm going to. Do I have
[2104.57s -> 2105.93s]  to own it too? I don't think you have
[2105.93s -> 2106.57s]  to own it.
[2106.57s -> 2108.73s]  Dude, you have to pay to earn how to
[2108.73s -> 2111.56s]  play too.
[2111.56s -> 2112.68s]  That's why. Secrets that give the
[2112.68s -> 2116.89s]  game the competitive edge.
[2116.89s -> 2119.45s]  Or like volleyball. Okay. I'm in the
[2119.45s -> 2120.65s]  game. Join on me
[2120.65s -> 2124.94s]  and we'll play volleyball. Or what?
[2124.94s -> 2125.82s]  Yeah, but
[2125.82s -> 2127.98s]  volleyball is just tennis. They
[2127.98s -> 2129.34s]  dragged the poles up a little bit
[2129.34s -> 2130.30s]  higher.
[2130.30s -> 2134.06s]  Guys, tennis has been around for
[2134.06s -> 2137.53s]  like 2000 years. Yeah, I believe it was
[2137.53s -> 2138.89s]  that tennis. Tennis was invented in the.
[2138.89s -> 2140.41s]  That invented. No, it wasn't.
[2140.41s -> 2141.61s]  No, it wasn't. It was the fucking Ming
[2141.61s -> 2143.45s]  dynasty. They fucking played tennis.
[2143.45s -> 2146.25s]  Yeah, and when Plato traveled there
[2146.25s -> 2147.93s]  he came up with it.
[2147.93s -> 2157.83s]  There's uh. There's new evidence to
[2157.83s -> 2160.07s]  suggest that Jesus was Japanese
[2160.07s -> 2162.63s]  as well and he had a son
[2162.63s -> 2165.91s]  and his name was something.
[2165.91s -> 2167.19s]  What are you doing right now? I don't
[2167.19s -> 2169.11s]  know. I don't know what this is.
[2169.11s -> 2171.08s]  Did I just lose?
[2171.16s -> 2174.28s]  I. Yes. I guess you have to hit it over.
[2174.28s -> 2175.88s]  You can only hit it three times and it
[2175.88s -> 2177.24s]  has to come over.
[2177.24s -> 2179.08s]  Okay, all right. So don't like jump
[2179.08s -> 2183.19s]  around.
[2183.19s -> 2185.67s]  If the ball slows down it's not
[2185.67s -> 2186.39s]  speed.
[2186.39s -> 2187.91s]  You're losing the speed aspect of the
[2187.91s -> 2191.62s]  game.
[2191.62s -> 2196.86s]  Nothing's going forward. I'm pressing.
[2196.86s -> 2198.30s]  Oh, I would laugh if it just landed
[2198.30s -> 2201.05s]  right there.
[2201.05s -> 2203.53s]  You suck ass.
[2203.53s -> 2204.65s]  This is the first time I've ever seen
[2204.65s -> 2207.72s]  it.
[2208.68s -> 2210.36s]  It's so hard not to just hit it
[2210.36s -> 2218.31s]  straight down.
[2218.31s -> 2219.51s]  All right, I think we're getting the
[2219.51s -> 2220.71s]  hang of this.
[2220.71s -> 2222.78s]  But how does that make any sense?
[2222.78s -> 2223.98s]  Wouldn't it have just been a point
[2223.98s -> 2225.50s]  for me? Oh my god.
[2225.50s -> 2227.96s]  What happened? You can only hit it
[2227.96s -> 2229.40s]  three times.
[2229.40s -> 2234.82s]  Good strategy. I'm thinking I'm
[2234.82s -> 2237.38s]  picking up on this.
[2239.78s -> 2242.02s]  Stop. I just gave you a perfect ball
[2242.02s -> 2243.38s]  to spike.
[2243.38s -> 2254.81s]  Oh fuck. Yeah, like when you jump and
[2254.81s -> 2255.21s]  press
[2255.21s -> 2256.81s]  up you just slam it down into the
[2256.81s -> 2258.89s]  ground. Yeah, you just can't. Oh my
[2258.89s -> 2259.77s]  god.
[2259.77s -> 2261.85s]  You have to be completely under the
[2261.85s -> 2264.31s]  ball for it to even be remotely
[2264.31s -> 2265.59s]  possible.
[2265.59s -> 2278.34s]  Oh no. Can I grab the ball and throw
[2278.34s -> 2279.30s]  it at you?
[2279.30s -> 2282.42s]  Does that still work?
[2282.42s -> 2284.98s]  I think you can still grab here.
[2284.98s -> 2288.63s]  Oh, well I just saved that one. That's
[2288.63s -> 2290.23s]  what I call a fucking
[2290.23s -> 2293.96s]  save.
[2293.96s -> 2300.09s]  How do I dive? How do I dive?
[2300.09s -> 2303.67s]  No. Why did I jump over it? What the fuck?
[2303.67s -> 2305.27s]  I actually really like this game mode.
[2305.27s -> 2307.19s]  It's very awkward, but...
[2307.19s -> 2312.18s]  No, I just almost died.
[2312.18s -> 2320.60s]  I just called you dead. I swear
[2320.60s -> 2332.87s]  to god.
[2332.87s -> 2335.32s]  I'm just playing simple D. Just hit it.
[2335.32s -> 2337.24s]  You just hit it back, you know?
[2337.24s -> 2342.01s]  It's because I'm like my fucking
[2342.01s -> 2343.85s]  analog like spins me around in
[2343.85s -> 2344.89s]  circles.
[2344.89s -> 2347.80s]  I'll tilt like one direction and then
[2347.80s -> 2349.40s]  I rip the other direction.
[2349.40s -> 2351.00s]  Ripping this thing out.
[2351.00s -> 2354.04s]  The controllers be like that.
[2354.04s -> 2357.34s]  I'm fucking tearing this thing out.
[2357.34s -> 2360.28s]  I'm gonna plug in my steam controller.
[2360.28s -> 2362.79s]  Do you actually use that?
[2362.79s -> 2375.16s]  No, god no. Oh my god no.
[2375.16s -> 2378.65s]  Mad Kuzbad blaming the controller.
[2378.65s -> 2380.73s]  Yeah, I can blame the controller
[2380.73s -> 2382.01s]  because I know that
[2382.01s -> 2383.69s]  in my brain I've got these inputs
[2383.69s -> 2384.97s]  and this knowledge and this data
[2384.97s -> 2387.45s]  that's just like
[2387.45s -> 2389.13s]  flying around everywhere and it's so
[2389.13s -> 2390.65s]  intense. And then like it has to
[2390.65s -> 2393.05s]  translate through my hands
[2393.05s -> 2395.53s]  into a controller. That's just like a
[2395.53s -> 2396.49s]  middle man.
[2396.49s -> 2398.17s]  About how you're too fast of a
[2398.17s -> 2399.77s]  thinker and you're too smart.
[2399.77s -> 2401.94s]  Yeah, like it has to transfer through
[2401.94s -> 2403.06s]  like it has to go through like the
[2403.06s -> 2405.06s]  pipeline to my hands and shit like
[2405.06s -> 2406.26s]  god damn it. Like just hook me into
[2406.26s -> 2407.30s]  the fucking machine. You know what I'm
[2407.30s -> 2408.82s]  saying?
[2408.82s -> 2422.28s]  Oh nice nice get.
[2422.28s -> 2424.28s]  See the pipeline of my brain just
[2424.28s -> 2426.52s]  wasn't ready.
[2426.52s -> 2429.53s]  See that's what I'm talking about.
[2429.53s -> 2433.72s]  My brain's pipeline is just like if
[2433.72s -> 2434.84s]  you could just connect a wire to the
[2434.84s -> 2435.64s]  back of your head and just like
[2435.64s -> 2436.92s]  stare at the screen and like hit out
[2436.92s -> 2438.76s]  go go go. Like you have to transfer
[2438.76s -> 2440.20s]  of data through your hands to the
[2440.20s -> 2441.08s]  controller.
[2441.08s -> 2444.62s]  There's too many middlemen there.
[2444.62s -> 2446.14s]  It's three hits.
[2446.14s -> 2450.44s]  Stop asking what happens. I will
[2450.44s -> 2451.56s]  divorce.
[2451.56s -> 2456.60s]  Oh boy you're really unraveling here.
[2456.60s -> 2459.88s]  Remember everyone's going to keep his
[2459.88s -> 2461.88s]  off.
[2465.77s -> 2469.06s]  Good one.
[2469.06s -> 2475.99s]  Whatever. Oh my god that is so
[2475.99s -> 2482.39s]  annoying.
[2486.78s -> 2489.88s]  I just tried to like I tried to
[2489.88s -> 2491.32s]  like meet the parents here right
[2491.32s -> 2492.52s]  there.
[2492.52s -> 2494.44s]  I was going to just like fall on spike
[2494.44s -> 2496.98s]  it down into your head.
[2496.98s -> 2498.50s]  Oh that would I wish you would have
[2498.50s -> 2499.94s]  just fucked it up right there.
[2499.94s -> 2504.63s]  I'm doing great. See I'm trying I'm
[2504.63s -> 2514.10s]  over complicating it.
[2514.10s -> 2517.94s]  Oh it always
[2517.94s -> 2520.50s]  I did go up. Be able to hit it up
[2520.50s -> 2521.46s]  from the air you
[2521.46s -> 2528.94s]  goon. Oh my god. I'm gonna win
[2528.94s -> 2530.70s]  this. This is the comeback.
[2530.70s -> 2533.10s]  No it's not. This is the comeback. I
[2533.10s -> 2535.10s]  literally I literally 100% guarantee
[2535.10s -> 2536.22s]  you don't. If not I will delete my
[2536.22s -> 2538.78s]  twitch channel.
[2538.78s -> 2544.84s]  Oh my god. See that's like that's
[2544.84s -> 2545.40s]  like
[2545.40s -> 2547.08s]  that's like the deal of winking at you
[2547.08s -> 2548.60s]  saying the next hand is blackjack
[2548.60s -> 2549.24s]  for you sir.
[2549.24s -> 2550.92s]  It's like I'm gonna go I'm gonna go all
[2550.92s -> 2552.52s]  in. Rematch me. Rematch me. Next game's
[2552.52s -> 2553.64s]  blackjack. Next hand.
[2553.64s -> 2555.00s]  Next I see I wasn't in the right
[2555.00s -> 2559.22s]  skin. This is the skin that I need
[2559.22s -> 2564.38s]  to win.
[2564.38s -> 2567.26s]  You made that bet a million times.
[2567.26s -> 2571.69s]  Yeah I know. So which one let's go
[2571.69s -> 2577.13s]  to this one. Construction joy.
[2577.13s -> 2579.61s]  Yeah I'm not gonna lose a single point
[2579.61s -> 2587.61s]  this game.
[2587.61s -> 2591.05s]  Yeah go get it noob.
[2591.05s -> 2594.15s]  This is the skin. This is the good one.
[2594.15s -> 2595.43s]  Boom.
[2595.43s -> 2609.11s]  What the fuck happened with that one?
[2609.11s -> 2610.71s]  See you can't press the direction
[2610.71s -> 2612.07s]  when you're in the air. Otherwise it
[2612.07s -> 2617.14s]  just goes straight to the ground.
[2617.14s -> 2622.07s]  Oh I'm not gonna lose a single point
[2622.07s -> 2626.89s]  because of you.
[2627.53s -> 2631.45s]  Getting a little tough there.
[2631.45s -> 2632.57s]  No it's because it yeah it's with
[2632.57s -> 2634.17s]  neutral air neutral air that's the
[2634.17s -> 2637.06s]  problem. Neutral air is the problem.
[2637.06s -> 2639.86s]  I see that's how I lost every point.
[2639.86s -> 2645.37s]  No that's not neutral air.
[2645.37s -> 2655.29s]  Fucking Jesus Christ almighty.
[2655.29s -> 2661.93s]  I'll wait.
[2675.06s -> 2677.22s]  No it didn't it didn't go to the
[2677.22s -> 2683.54s]  right like I thought it would.
[2683.54s -> 2684.90s]  I'm trying to be fancy you can hit
[2684.90s -> 2686.34s]  it straight up so if you press up it
[2686.34s -> 2687.72s]  will go up.
[2687.72s -> 2689.40s]  I'm too scared to do that that's too
[2689.40s -> 2691.82s]  much for me.
[2691.82s -> 2698.46s]  I did it again he did it again.
[2698.46s -> 2710.71s]  See when when you wrote the script
[2710.71s -> 2712.78s]  before we started this stream
[2712.78s -> 2714.06s]  yeah you didn't think this would be
[2714.06s -> 2715.26s]  funny.
[2715.26s -> 2717.88s]  What this?
[2717.88s -> 2719.00s]  Yeah remember when we wrote the
[2719.00s -> 2720.44s]  script and we're like yeah let's not
[2720.44s -> 2721.88s]  know how to not hit the ball into the
[2721.88s -> 2723.16s]  ground for like 30 minutes and you
[2723.16s -> 2724.60s]  were like nah that's not gonna be
[2724.60s -> 2726.60s]  that funny.
[2726.60s -> 2730.09s]  What are you playing? Yes.
[2730.17s -> 2733.27s]  This script.
[2738.26s -> 2740.26s]  I swear to god I fucking had it I had
[2740.26s -> 2741.70s]  him right there in my grasp and I just
[2741.70s -> 2743.14s]  let him go.
[2743.14s -> 2760.62s]  Again shit okay I'll try that again.
[2760.62s -> 2766.52s]  Now it's tied.
[2768.92s -> 2771.64s]  Oh this is too much for me I don't
[2771.64s -> 2776.26s]  unravel here come on.
[2776.26s -> 2779.72s]  Whoo as as painful as this is and
[2779.72s -> 2781.40s]  how stupid we look I actually really
[2781.40s -> 2784.18s]  like this game.
[2784.18s -> 2787.06s]  I came all the way back there too.
[2787.06s -> 2788.97s]  It was the skin.
[2788.97s -> 2791.21s]  People were like on the sub reddit just
[2791.21s -> 2793.37s]  like in real time going like come back
[2793.37s -> 2795.29s]  of the century dude he's coming back
[2795.29s -> 2797.05s]  right now and I got like a rush from
[2797.05s -> 2798.01s]  it
[2798.01s -> 2801.02s]  on the reddit. Yeah like you refresh
[2801.02s -> 2802.70s]  like new comments like zero minutes
[2802.70s -> 2803.74s]  zero minutes zero minutes you know
[2803.74s -> 2804.70s]  I mean
[2804.70s -> 2809.06s]  fucking let them all down.
[2809.06s -> 2812.18s]  Everyone got banned just vote random
[2812.18s -> 2813.22s]  every time because otherwise I think
[2813.22s -> 2815.38s]  it makes us wait 10 seconds
[2815.38s -> 2817.40s]  for each person to vote I don't know.
[2817.40s -> 2820.04s]  Does it?
[2820.04s -> 2822.20s]  All right I'm gonna let's let's try a new
[2822.20s -> 2823.24s]  game mode after this one.
[2823.24s -> 2829.70s]  Get the reddit post ready.
[2829.70s -> 2835.03s]  Whatever. You just just whatever.
[2835.03s -> 2844.70s]  He's not gonna do it he's gonna fuck
[2844.70s -> 2846.62s]  up here he's too far away.
[2846.62s -> 2847.98s]  In the name of god was hat what
[2847.98s -> 2849.26s]  happened that you did your special
[2849.26s -> 2850.78s]  move.
[2850.78s -> 2851.98s]  Oh of course he wants to play with
[2851.98s -> 2861.03s]  items on.
[2861.03s -> 2864.87s]  It's a dead ball it just died.
[2864.87s -> 2866.71s]  Deflate bait.
[2866.71s -> 2869.11s]  That was Daria from fucking the Daria
[2869.11s -> 2871.70s]  intro.
[2871.70s -> 2873.14s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me here.
[2873.14s -> 2874.74s]  Oh what a recovery the reddit's gonna
[2874.74s -> 2878.20s]  be talking about this one for a year.
[2878.20s -> 2897.77s]  Oh no oh no.
[2897.77s -> 2900.78s]  You're dead.
[2900.78s -> 2903.67s]  You're dead buddy. What a fun game.
[2903.67s -> 2907.35s]  Oh my god.
[2907.35s -> 2908.95s]  That one wasn't a mistake like it
[2908.95s -> 2910.31s]  wasn't the same dumb thing we've
[2910.31s -> 2911.75s]  been doing that was I thought I had
[2911.75s -> 2912.55s]  it.
[2915.43s -> 2918.71s]  Oh my god the reddit.
[2918.71s -> 2921.00s]  My life for reddit.
[2921.00s -> 2922.76s]  A good thing that didn't hit it.
[2922.76s -> 2924.28s]  I swear to fucking god dude I'm never
[2924.28s -> 2925.40s]  I'm never playing that ever again
[2925.40s -> 2936.62s]  enough doing that ever again.
[2936.62s -> 2937.66s]  I've come to know how you're gonna
[2937.66s -> 2938.86s]  do that shit you can throw it over
[2938.86s -> 2942.09s]  every time that's how you do it.
[2942.09s -> 2945.77s]  See that's what he does. It's a good
[2945.77s -> 2946.41s]  move.
[2946.41s -> 2955.58s]  I died. How about a taste of your
[2955.58s -> 2972.42s]  own fucking grandpa's applesauce.
[2972.42s -> 2974.76s]  No.
[2974.76s -> 2976.68s]  I thought I would bunt it over I
[2976.76s -> 2979.46s]  don't think I pressed it right.
[2979.46s -> 2987.74s]  Oh that was a good recovery.
[2987.74s -> 2993.83s]  Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
[2993.83s -> 3002.82s]  Every time in the fucking corner.
[3002.82s -> 3004.98s]  That was a that was a conflict in the
[3004.98s -> 3010.73s]  middle there.
[3010.73s -> 3019.14s]  One more point. You would have just
[3019.14s -> 3020.26s]  lost right there.
[3020.26s -> 3022.90s]  No mother. Thank goodness gracious.
[3022.90s -> 3030.54s]  It comes down to this burst 18.
[3030.54s -> 3032.78s]  Hot hot hot hot hot hot hot too hot.
[3032.78s -> 3036.25s]  Too hot hot.
[3036.25s -> 3040.18s]  Too hot.
[3040.18s -> 3042.18s]  Actually really again I'm a broken
[3042.18s -> 3050.17s]  record but that's really fun.
[3050.17s -> 3051.45s]  All right let's go let's let's give
[3051.45s -> 3054.04s]  you a character. Did you see how many
[3054.04s -> 3055.48s]  points we had?
[3055.48s -> 3060.81s]  No I got 1400. All right we got uh
[3060.81s -> 3063.94s]  we got all right we have Mega Man boss
[3063.94s -> 3066.50s]  Fat McCree and then like a
[3066.50s -> 3067.78s]  Dr Wily.
[3067.78s -> 3069.38s]  I want to play Doombox because
[3069.38s -> 3071.46s]  he's so big and that's how I am.
[3071.46s -> 3073.94s]  I just keep getting bigger and bigger.
[3073.94s -> 3075.86s]  So I'm getting Doombox. All right I'm
[3075.86s -> 3077.46s]  going to do the Mega Man boss.
[3077.46s -> 3081.38s]  This is like cut man. Told you.
[3081.38s -> 3085.24s]  Okay. I was seeing the game again.
[3085.24s -> 3087.88s]  All right so like I got this dude.
[3087.88s -> 3089.80s]  Okay cool. I could not afford a game
[3089.80s -> 3094.30s]  mode. We're just going to unlock it.
[3094.30s -> 3100.39s]  Now we can unlock how to play two by
[3100.39s -> 3101.99s]  the way. Yeah but I know how to play
[3101.99s -> 3103.43s]  two.
[3103.43s -> 3107.48s]  Oh are we red? Oh only three
[3107.48s -> 3110.23s]  costumes here.
[3110.23s -> 3114.62s]  Two three uh four. Let me be green guy.
[3114.62s -> 3121.70s]  What is what mode is this? I couldn't
[3121.70s -> 3123.62s]  afford another one since volleyball.
[3123.62s -> 3130.17s]  Oh well there it is started. Okay
[3130.17s -> 3132.09s]  that's a good start.
[3132.09s -> 3135.45s]  Oh I can't double jump but I get a
[3135.45s -> 3139.34s]  float.
[3139.34s -> 3142.62s]  What I'm too big. I'm too big.
[3142.62s -> 3158.09s]  Yeah your pit box is just weird.
[3158.09s -> 3160.81s]  Like don't even fucking. I swear on
[3160.81s -> 3162.33s]  everything that I've ever done
[3162.33s -> 3164.09s]  that that was like I was said I was
[3164.09s -> 3165.45s]  desperately trying to make that not
[3165.45s -> 3166.25s]  happen.
[3166.25s -> 3171.90s]  Oh god I thought it would bounce far
[3171.90s -> 3172.54s]  enough.
[3172.54s -> 3176.54s]  I got these big arms for nothing.
[3176.62s -> 3181.45s]  He's so he's too big for this shit. I
[3181.45s -> 3183.61s]  can't get it out of the corner.
[3183.61s -> 3203.13s]  I didn't even see where that went. Whoa.
[3203.13s -> 3204.17s]  I don't know what it does.
[3204.17s -> 3207.86s]  Oh oh can I test mine? Oh no I
[3207.86s -> 3209.30s]  can't. Yeah you have to build up
[3209.30s -> 3216.14s]  that many hits in a round.
[3216.65s -> 3220.81s]  It's gonna get over. Nope nope nope.
[3220.81s -> 3243.66s]  How many pickles man? I don't like this
[3243.66s -> 3244.62s]  character.
[3244.62s -> 3245.90s]  Maybe at least not for volleyball
[3245.90s -> 3252.49s]  because it's a piece of shit.
[3252.49s -> 3254.33s]  Did you break it? You stepped on it. I
[3254.33s -> 3255.85s]  just hit straight down.
[3255.85s -> 3259.22s]  Oh I was trying to play a little bit
[3259.22s -> 3261.70s]  fancy. My throw doesn't gain you
[3261.70s -> 3262.82s]  meter.
[3262.82s -> 3274.70s]  Holy fuck. I don't know what this
[3274.70s -> 3275.90s]  does but I'm gonna do it. No I'm
[3275.90s -> 3277.58s]  not. I spent too much time focusing
[3277.58s -> 3278.54s]  on the special and I should have just
[3278.54s -> 3281.80s]  won the game.
[3281.88s -> 3290.90s]  Nope. Shit. It all comes down to this.
[3290.90s -> 3296.63s]  No god it's so hard to not do.
[3296.63s -> 3298.63s]  I want to hit it forward now you
[3298.63s -> 3301.85s]  straight down.
[3301.85s -> 3303.61s]  He's kind of doing reddit. Okay let's
[3303.61s -> 3304.73s]  play a normal one so we can see what
[3304.73s -> 3306.81s]  our supers do.
[3306.81s -> 3309.54s]  That sounds a good idea. So do we
[3309.54s -> 3311.14s]  rematch or you just join again?
[3311.14s -> 3313.46s]  No just play. I can change the game
[3313.46s -> 3314.58s]  mode in here.
[3314.58s -> 3318.60s]  Oh okay. I can't press rematch.
[3318.60s -> 3321.46s]  What? I'm in the character slot. No I
[3321.46s -> 3322.50s]  think I have to just rejoin you.
[3322.50s -> 3327.78s]  Well no I can't even quit the game.
[3327.78s -> 3329.14s]  I believe I'm stuck here forever. It
[3329.14s -> 3330.50s]  works for everyone else.
[3330.50s -> 3335.40s]  What did you do? I don't know. There's
[3335.40s -> 3337.72s]  a countdown on my screen?
[3337.72s -> 3339.16s]  All right well what's the countdown
[3339.16s -> 3341.96s]  at? Oh it like
[3341.96s -> 3343.64s]  count it down you for not selecting
[3343.64s -> 3344.84s]  a character. Now we're starting a
[3344.84s -> 3346.68s]  game.
[3346.68s -> 3347.64s]  Are you sure about that? We're
[3347.64s -> 3351.13s]  starting a video game right now. Yeah.
[3351.93s -> 3354.49s]  Okay now I can only quit. So you're
[3354.49s -> 3355.69s]  going to want to alt f4. I took away my
[3355.69s -> 3358.52s]  rematch.
[3358.52s -> 3365.08s]  Come on. Son of a god damn. Oh yeah
[3365.08s -> 3366.44s]  striker is the other game mode is
[3366.44s -> 3371.13s]  supposed to be right here.
[3371.13s -> 3381.14s]  Fucking I I I forced quit OBS.
[3381.14s -> 3385.43s]  No that has nothing to do with cox.
[3385.43s -> 3388.15s]  Jesus god damn it man. Rage quit.
[3388.15s -> 3397.99s]  I like oh that's so that I'm so
[3397.99s -> 3400.95s]  I'm so angry that I just alt f4ed
[3400.95s -> 3402.15s]  OBS.
[3402.15s -> 3406.22s]  Like I alt I fucking force quit OBS. I
[3406.22s -> 3408.86s]  did like the task man.
[3408.86s -> 3413.45s]  I get it. It's not even on the same
[3413.45s -> 3414.33s]  window.
[3414.33s -> 3416.41s]  Oh can I can I just like lock a
[3416.41s -> 3418.01s]  window to never be like removed you
[3418.01s -> 3419.37s]  know what I mean? Windows 11
[3419.37s -> 3423.00s]  make it happen. I can't wait for
[3423.00s -> 3424.60s]  Windows 11. It's going to be so much
[3424.60s -> 3425.40s]  better.
[3425.40s -> 3427.88s]  Don't worry they're going to skip
[3427.88s -> 3429.00s]  two versions and they'll come up with
[3429.00s -> 3433.53s]  like Windows 15.
[3433.53s -> 3435.78s]  All right I'm back. I'm going to join
[3435.78s -> 3437.14s]  your game.
[3438.55s -> 3442.78s]  He what a noob. It's weird too for
[3442.78s -> 3444.14s]  having power ups on.
[3444.14s -> 3448.47s]  Like there aren't that many of them.
[3448.47s -> 3452.70s]  Oh yeah and there's a minimum ball
[3452.70s -> 3456.20s]  speed you can set.
[3456.20s -> 3457.80s]  All right so you you know what?
[3457.80s -> 3460.02s]  Yeah. All right coming in.
[3460.02s -> 3462.39s]  Oh good thing we're gonna have two
[3462.39s -> 3465.61s]  streams here now.
[3465.61s -> 3466.97s]  God damn it like such like a
[3466.97s -> 3469.21s]  bonehead accidental like just kill
[3469.21s -> 3470.73s]  OBS. Hey hey give yourself a break.
[3470.73s -> 3471.77s]  You've never streamed before you
[3471.77s -> 3476.38s]  know it's been a long time.
[3476.38s -> 3477.90s]  Yeah I raised the volume on music. I
[3477.90s -> 3478.94s]  saw people saying that they couldn't
[3478.94s -> 3480.70s]  hear it so I put it up a little bit.
[3480.70s -> 3487.98s]  I just listen I heard you say hit alt
[3487.98s -> 3489.34s]  f4.
[3489.34s -> 3493.42s]  What is that? Is that your special?
[3493.42s -> 3496.54s]  You turn into an electronic device?
[3496.54s -> 3501.40s]  I don't know what this does.
[3501.40s -> 3505.99s]  Oh I think I like I have no idea what
[3505.99s -> 3508.79s]  that does. It goes into my hand.
[3508.79s -> 3510.42s]  It looks like it comes back to me.
[3510.42s -> 3511.54s]  Yeah.
[3511.54s -> 3518.92s]  Well let's see what yours does.
[3518.92s -> 3521.72s]  Nothing.
[3523.72s -> 3525.00s]  No that must be like a proximity
[3525.00s -> 3526.20s]  thing. It must like knock me around
[3526.20s -> 3527.48s]  or something.
[3527.48s -> 3542.38s]  Maybe you can change directions. The ball
[3542.38s -> 3542.94s]  homes
[3542.94s -> 3545.85s]  into you apparently when you do that.
[3545.85s -> 3549.14s]  I don't I don't I guess I don't know.
[3549.14s -> 3551.27s]  Wow that killed me.
[3551.27s -> 3553.19s]  Yeah it fucking murdered me.
[3553.19s -> 3558.25s]  Do you have like extra speed on the
[3558.25s -> 3559.53s]  ball or extra power on the ball?
[3559.53s -> 3561.05s]  Are they like actual stats like that?
[3561.05s -> 3562.97s]  I don't think so.
[3562.97s -> 3567.64s]  Oh my lord. Oh my god.
[3567.64s -> 3569.48s]  Oh my goodness I didn't hit the ball
[3569.48s -> 3570.68s]  once.
[3570.68s -> 3588.78s]  Yeah I have no idea what that's doing.
[3588.78s -> 3591.66s]  Whoa whoa okay. Oh he's got like a hook
[3591.66s -> 3592.46s]  arm.
[3592.46s -> 3595.02s]  I hooked to it after I hit it.
[3595.02s -> 3607.53s]  Strangely enough.
[3607.53s -> 3614.58s]  Hey what the fuck was that?
[3614.58s -> 3617.64s]  I don't know. What did I get? What did I get?
[3617.64s -> 3623.91s]  What's my Mario Kart? Oh god.
[3623.91s -> 3628.52s]  No stay away from me. No. I'm afraid
[3628.52s -> 3629.88s]  to even go near it.
[3629.88s -> 3632.31s]  I okay I just get done. What happened
[3632.31s -> 3633.91s]  there? It. I'm confused.
[3633.91s -> 3635.67s]  It got bumped it somehow and then
[3635.67s -> 3637.43s]  when it hits the ground it resets
[3637.43s -> 3640.31s]  to me and I guess you didn't hit it.
[3640.31s -> 3650.70s]  Football's the worst power up. Is it?
[3650.70s -> 3655.80s]  Doombox uh. He seems very uh hard to
[3655.80s -> 3657.72s]  use. He seems like the worst character
[3657.72s -> 3660.60s]  you could possibly have. He's big
[3660.60s -> 3661.96s]  and everyone's saying his special is
[3661.96s -> 3663.40s]  homing so that just means you know
[3663.40s -> 3664.76s]  where the ball is gonna go
[3664.76s -> 3671.53s]  which is bad. Maybe. Come back to
[3671.53s -> 3673.29s]  volleyball.
[3673.29s -> 3675.37s]  Doombox special shoots the ball
[3675.37s -> 3677.05s]  straight at the enemy.
[3677.05s -> 3678.81s]  Yeah so that's what I'm saying it's like
[3678.81s -> 3681.05s]  you you know where the ball is going to
[3681.05s -> 3684.18s]  go so it's bad.
[3684.18s -> 3686.02s]  I think there's a there's a few people
[3686.02s -> 3687.78s]  that are telling you that you might
[3687.78s -> 3690.66s]  be uh wrong about this statement
[3690.66s -> 3692.74s]  because apparently he's very good.
[3692.74s -> 3694.36s]  Well you know what I'm telling you
[3694.36s -> 3697.46s]  is that um who are you going to
[3697.46s -> 3699.54s]  believe twitch chat or me?
[3699.54s -> 3701.38s]  I mean apparently the best player in
[3701.38s -> 3704.10s]  lethal league mains Doombox so
[3704.10s -> 3705.30s]  I I don't know I mean what does
[3705.30s -> 3706.74s]  that say? Because that guy is a
[3706.74s -> 3708.18s]  boombox and he just plays him
[3708.18s -> 3709.38s]  because he associates with the
[3709.38s -> 3711.70s]  character.
[3711.70s -> 3714.02s]  Oh we're doing this thing again? Yeah I
[3714.02s -> 3716.15s]  like this.
[3716.15s -> 3725.94s]  No I couldn't reach it. Oh my god.
[3725.94s -> 3727.38s]  He was a little sloppy he was a little
[3727.38s -> 3732.94s]  sloppy.
[3732.94s -> 3734.86s]  Oh he's getting a little sloppy. It's
[3734.86s -> 3736.46s]  because my ping pong paddle has horns
[3736.46s -> 3743.77s]  on it.
[3743.77s -> 3745.69s]  Well nice fight. He's getting a little
[3745.69s -> 3755.46s]  sloppy. I didn't hit it straight to
[3755.46s -> 3764.95s]  the ground.
[3764.95s -> 3769.83s]  That time I did.
[3769.99s -> 3775.72s]  Did I just re? No I didn't.
[3777.00s -> 3778.36s]  I was trying to knock it back. I wasn't
[3778.36s -> 3779.48s]  thrown to the wall where it just
[3779.48s -> 3781.16s]  doesn't even bounce.
[3781.16s -> 3789.40s]  Oh my god he's gonna fuck it up
[3789.40s -> 3790.76s]  again.
[3790.76s -> 3797.70s]  It's in slow motion. Stop with the
[3797.70s -> 3807.94s]  funky shit and just get it over there.
[3807.94s -> 3809.06s]  What?
[3809.06s -> 3812.90s]  Go straight down. Straight down.
[3812.90s -> 3815.62s]  Straight down. Not even at an angle.
[3815.62s -> 3818.55s]  Straight fucking down.
[3818.55s -> 3829.91s]  I don't even how is it impossible?
[3829.91s -> 3838.20s]  Oh shit. Oh there we go. You accidentally
[3838.20s -> 3840.60s]  pressed forward so you're gonna hit
[3840.60s -> 3847.69s]  straight down. Not even. Why did I set
[3847.69s -> 3848.25s]  you?
[3848.25s -> 3849.53s]  I was like he's not gonna expect this
[3849.53s -> 3853.61s]  button. Why would anyone do this?
[3853.61s -> 3858.07s]  Why would anyone do this? Okay.
[3858.07s -> 3869.22s]  Up. Up. No. Oh fuck.
[3869.22s -> 3876.15s]  Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.
[3876.15s -> 3880.28s]  Hey I'm ready. My brain is prepped.
[3885.74s -> 3891.43s]  Oh wowie man. Wowie. That was actually
[3891.43s -> 3892.47s]  really great.
[3892.47s -> 3894.07s]  That was a great volley. I mean it just
[3894.07s -> 3896.07s]  was. Nobody can say otherwise. They just
[3896.07s -> 3897.03s]  can't.
[3897.03s -> 3899.67s]  Oh that's not so much though. That one
[3899.67s -> 3915.06s]  not so much. That was not so much.
[3915.06s -> 3921.54s]  Nice. 600 experience points. I wish I
[3921.54s -> 3924.86s]  could have. I could unbind
[3924.94s -> 3930.14s]  forward. You might be able to.
[3930.14s -> 3931.98s]  No because I wouldn't be able to walk
[3931.98s -> 3933.42s]  forward. What's the uh what's the other
[3933.42s -> 3934.54s]  game mode?
[3934.54s -> 3936.94s]  Strikers which is you have to defend
[3936.94s -> 3938.70s]  against the thing but if you buy it
[3938.70s -> 3940.46s]  you have to be the host and I put it
[3940.46s -> 3942.14s]  into your game last time.
[3942.14s -> 3945.34s]  Should we learn to play again? There
[3945.34s -> 3946.22s]  has to be something either we don't
[3946.22s -> 3948.28s]  know. I'm buying it.
[3948.28s -> 3949.64s]  Okay but I'm saying how to play.
[3949.64s -> 3950.60s]  You're gonna have to be able to
[3950.60s -> 3951.96s]  host.
[3951.96s -> 3953.51s]  No well then just play another
[3953.51s -> 3955.27s]  couple because. Because I can't afford
[3955.27s -> 3958.09s]  it.
[3958.09s -> 3959.29s]  All right let's see what's what's this
[3959.29s -> 3961.21s]  uh learn to play two.
[3961.21s -> 3964.98s]  You do it too. I think it just
[3964.98s -> 3966.42s]  watch my stream.
[3966.42s -> 3968.34s]  Open up my stream. Watch my stream.
[3968.34s -> 3970.50s]  Teaches you the the ball parry.
[3970.50s -> 3972.17s]  All right so here we go. You can
[3972.17s -> 3974.01s]  bump by holding. You can you can aim
[3974.01s -> 3976.33s]  bunts by holding left or right.
[3976.33s -> 3978.41s]  Nice elaborate scheme to get one plus
[3978.41s -> 3979.77s]  one viewer.
[3979.77s -> 3981.13s]  You can also aim bunts down
[3981.13s -> 3982.73s]  advanced okay.
[3982.73s -> 3984.41s]  Bunt down by pressing B and holding
[3984.41s -> 3985.85s]  down. Okay nice all right you can
[3985.85s -> 3987.77s]  bunt down. You didn't know that.
[3987.77s -> 3990.25s]  I knew that. Hit the ball back and
[3990.25s -> 3991.61s]  forth at high speed.
[3991.61s -> 3994.10s]  Okay you probably didn't know you could
[3994.10s -> 3995.86s]  do that.
[3995.86s -> 3997.14s]  You can see when the ball would
[3997.14s -> 3999.70s]  release on the boombox.
[3999.70s -> 4002.90s]  Oh you probably didn't know that.
[4002.90s -> 4010.76s]  Yeah so you can see what the ball
[4010.76s -> 4013.75s]  would release. I knew that.
[4013.75s -> 4015.67s]  Did you? How come you didn't say
[4015.67s -> 4016.87s]  anything about it?
[4016.87s -> 4019.50s]  So I thought you knew. You can parry
[4019.50s -> 4021.02s]  if your opponent tries to hijack your
[4021.02s -> 4022.06s]  ball.
[4022.06s -> 4024.15s]  I'm doing this so you don't have to
[4024.15s -> 4026.92s]  pay for it. To activate your parry
[4026.92s -> 4029.08s]  hit the ball and press B.
[4029.08s -> 4032.94s]  You didn't know that. I told you that
[4032.94s -> 4034.62s]  before you started the stream.
[4034.62s -> 4036.54s]  You did you did not know hitting the
[4036.54s -> 4038.22s]  ball and then pressing B.
[4038.22s -> 4039.58s]  I've never seen you do that move one
[4039.58s -> 4040.54s]  time. Because you haven't tried to
[4040.54s -> 4042.70s]  steal the ball from me once.
[4042.70s -> 4043.82s]  This didn't happen. Look at this. This
[4043.82s -> 4045.66s]  like animation didn't happen.
[4045.66s -> 4052.14s]  You didn't even know that. When you
[4052.14s -> 4053.26s]  serve the ball it automatically
[4053.26s -> 4056.12s]  parries.
[4056.12s -> 4057.40s]  So remember it depletes your energy
[4057.40s -> 4059.00s]  bar in case you were curious.
[4059.00s -> 4063.06s]  So you can grab the ball by the way.
[4063.06s -> 4064.90s]  You're watching? Yeah I'm watching.
[4064.90s -> 4067.06s]  Okay so if somebody's parrying you can
[4067.06s -> 4070.02s]  pull the ball out of their hand.
[4070.02s -> 4072.71s]  I didn't know that. Well look something
[4072.71s -> 4074.15s]  else you didn't know.
[4074.15s -> 4076.39s]  Now you know. It's right stick to say
[4076.39s -> 4077.51s]  all the emotes. You were looking for
[4077.51s -> 4079.03s]  this.
[4079.03s -> 4086.17s]  Now you know. See okay that was
[4086.17s -> 4088.44s]  160 dollars.
[4088.44s -> 4089.96s]  I'm ready to play. And so are you. So
[4089.96s -> 4091.00s]  you don't have like we
[4091.00s -> 4093.00s]  you don't have to play for it now. I
[4093.00s -> 4096.84s]  totally don't have to play for it.
[4096.84s -> 4104.22s]  Okay join game. I kind of like the
[4104.22s -> 4107.03s]  cut man. Cut man? His special is weird to
[4107.03s -> 4107.67s]  me.
[4107.67s -> 4108.95s]  I don't see how you would use his
[4108.95s -> 4110.79s]  special in volleyball.
[4110.79s -> 4113.93s]  Oh you're really on this volleyball.
[4113.93s -> 4116.49s]  I'm on this volleyball thing.
[4116.49s -> 4119.53s]  Okay you really like this game mode.
[4119.53s -> 4124.60s]  Think of all the strategy. Think of
[4124.60s -> 4125.88s]  how hard you can hit the ball
[4125.88s -> 4134.50s]  straight down.
[4134.50s -> 4143.80s]  Ready. Oh home court advantage.
[4143.80s -> 4145.48s]  I'll try. I thought you had a
[4145.48s -> 4146.84s]  little bit of a different approach
[4146.84s -> 4160.01s]  there.
[4160.01s -> 4162.17s]  Oh that was a good one. Yeah reach over
[4162.17s -> 4166.58s]  the net. Good job.
[4166.58s -> 4168.42s]  Nice. Nice. See we're getting better at
[4168.42s -> 4170.33s]  this.
[4170.33s -> 4172.09s]  I'm gonna be best volleyball player in
[4172.09s -> 4173.45s]  North America.
[4173.45s -> 4176.39s]  Yeah I wish. I tell you know what and
[4176.39s -> 4178.07s]  that just you said you talked so I
[4178.07s -> 4179.43s]  couldn't play. Oh sorry. Sorry. I
[4179.43s -> 4184.26s]  won't talk anymore.
[4184.26s -> 4186.02s]  Okay okay Trolla didn't turn to the
[4186.02s -> 4188.26s]  other way. I was quiet.
[4188.26s -> 4192.73s]  Just just quiet. I was gonna hit it
[4192.73s -> 4194.09s]  straight down. See I talked and then
[4194.09s -> 4214.86s]  you fucked it up.
[4215.58s -> 4224.66s]  Damn. Let's roll. That was a that was a
[4224.66s -> 4228.68s]  move you did there.
[4228.68s -> 4231.08s]  Oh what? It sped up off the wall. So
[4231.08s -> 4232.52s]  weird.
[4232.52s -> 4239.06s]  That was weird. That was strange.
[4239.06s -> 4245.11s]  Back at your own net.
[4245.11s -> 4246.79s]  That you see if you that was a nice
[4246.79s -> 4248.15s]  move. You got you you
[4248.15s -> 4253.16s]  messed with my expectations there.
[4253.16s -> 4255.56s]  Trying to emulate what you did. Great
[4255.56s -> 4259.00s]  move. I'm gonna try it.
[4260.60s -> 4266.81s]  Oh don't you dare. I what it wasn't
[4266.81s -> 4267.93s]  close enough for that. I wasn't close
[4267.93s -> 4269.45s]  enough for that apparently.
[4269.45s -> 4272.09s]  Apparently. I don't use this character.
[4272.09s -> 4275.85s]  I gave up. I'm not using him again.
[4275.85s -> 4278.01s]  He's a good character. His body's too
[4278.01s -> 4279.21s]  weird for me.
[4279.21s -> 4283.24s]  This guy's body is just so strange.
[4283.24s -> 4284.36s]  His tail is all the way over there.
[4284.36s -> 4286.12s]  His face comes out.
[4286.12s -> 4287.48s]  He's like this Donald Duck looking
[4287.48s -> 4288.76s]  motherfucker like no I'm done with
[4288.76s -> 4296.34s]  him.
[4296.34s -> 4308.44s]  Really be like that. Wow. It made you
[4308.44s -> 4312.78s]  they make you even buy new songs.
[4312.78s -> 4314.86s]  No he's a good character if it's not
[4314.86s -> 4316.14s]  in that.
[4316.14s -> 4319.80s]  He's just too he's too long. Dink.
[4319.80s -> 4321.08s]  You parried me didn't you.
[4321.08s -> 4322.68s]  Yep. I thought you're being real cute.
[4322.68s -> 4324.20s]  Well the serve always parries.
[4324.20s -> 4327.94s]  You just read that. I mean I didn't
[4327.94s -> 4329.62s]  that was about two minutes ago.
[4329.62s -> 4330.74s]  Just reading it would be like right
[4330.74s -> 4332.42s]  now. Got it.
[4332.42s -> 4335.99s]  You ready for this play?
[4342.71s -> 4345.27s]  I heard that like a two seconds later.
[4345.27s -> 4348.15s]  I heard me myself screaming.
[4348.15s -> 4358.71s]  I swear to fucking god.
[4366.23s -> 4367.83s]  What is happening?
[4367.83s -> 4369.86s]  I just I can't I don't I can't do it
[4369.86s -> 4371.86s]  anymore. I like lost my mojo into the
[4371.86s -> 4372.98s]  game.
[4372.98s -> 4378.89s]  I think it's this character. I don't
[4378.89s -> 4380.09s]  think this character is very good for
[4380.09s -> 4381.21s]  this. No it's
[4381.21s -> 4382.81s]  it's this game mode it's like too
[4382.81s -> 4385.74s]  deliberate. Oh you have to like
[4385.74s -> 4407.99s]  you have to think. No.
[4407.99s -> 4409.75s]  What and and I hit I hit the ball
[4409.75s -> 4411.03s]  I hit the ball backwards to myself.
[4411.03s -> 4412.95s]  You hit the top of the net.
[4412.95s -> 4415.27s]  I you know what I like hit the ball
[4415.27s -> 4416.31s]  went backwards.
[4416.31s -> 4418.15s]  Went the other way there backwards.
[4418.15s -> 4419.59s]  I'm not sure what fucking happened on
[4419.59s -> 4423.19s]  that one.
[4423.19s -> 4426.26s]  I want I want to play the regular game.
[4426.26s -> 4428.66s]  Oh my god fine.
[4428.66s -> 4430.34s]  This is like this is like the star
[4430.34s -> 4431.54s]  game mode and you all know what I'm
[4431.54s -> 4433.32s]  talking about.
[4433.32s -> 4436.28s]  This is the star game mode where
[4436.28s -> 4437.48s]  after the stream
[4437.48s -> 4439.24s]  he's going to put like a hundred
[4439.24s -> 4442.31s]  hours into this game mode.
[4442.31s -> 4444.07s]  I left because I can afford the other
[4444.07s -> 4451.90s]  game mode.
[4451.90s -> 4453.90s]  Now I can't leave again. I don't want
[4453.90s -> 4454.70s]  to all tap
[4454.70s -> 4458.52s]  OBS and kill it. All right I'm going
[4458.52s -> 4460.12s]  to make this run into this real
[4460.12s -> 4462.20s]  slowly here. Well I'm hosting.
[4462.20s -> 4465.70s]  Hold on hold on. Okay I think I'm safe.
[4465.70s -> 4473.62s]  Oh it's it's the goddamn star mode.
[4473.62s -> 4480.65s]  Are there AIs in this? I think so.
[4480.65s -> 4482.79s]  All right coming in. Do we do you have
[4482.79s -> 4484.23s]  enough for the new game? Yeah yeah
[4484.23s -> 4485.51s]  I'm hosting already.
[4485.51s -> 4492.10s]  Oh yes I was gonna say that
[4492.10s -> 4493.54s]  striker's play needs four people
[4493.54s -> 4495.30s]  for it to be good
[4495.30s -> 4496.98s]  but I don't see where I can add AI.
[4496.98s -> 4498.42s]  He used to be able to I know that
[4498.42s -> 4500.18s]  because we did it.
[4500.18s -> 4501.70s]  Maybe I guess we could just do quick
[4501.70s -> 4502.90s]  jump.
[4502.90s -> 4505.96s]  Also the star wants to play with AI
[4505.96s -> 4507.48s]  instead.
[4507.48s -> 4508.92s]  I don't know if you're supposed to
[4508.92s -> 4512.94s]  beach ball if it's probably not.
[4512.94s -> 4514.54s]  So what is this? You're defending
[4514.54s -> 4516.14s]  your
[4516.14s -> 4519.18s]  your hole. Oh okay so
[4519.18s -> 4520.86s]  can you hit your own hole?
[4520.86s -> 4523.70s]  I'm sure we'll find out. Yeah um
[4523.70s -> 4524.66s]  because if you can put it in your
[4524.66s -> 4525.70s]  own like hole that would be bad. Yeah the
[4525.70s -> 4528.18s]  beach ball sucks for this.
[4528.18s -> 4530.49s]  Hold on let me see can I can you
[4530.49s -> 4532.01s]  can you put it in your own like
[4532.01s -> 4537.80s]  like I don't think you can. I mean
[4537.80s -> 4538.36s]  we're
[4538.36s -> 4540.12s]  kind of testing how these the game
[4540.12s -> 4541.24s]  works.
[4541.24s -> 4545.50s]  All right I get it. That's cool. No you
[4545.50s -> 4546.14s]  can't. Yeah
[4546.14s -> 4554.70s]  it's really good.
[4554.70s -> 4556.06s]  Yeah this is rough with only two
[4556.06s -> 4562.87s]  people as well.
[4562.87s -> 4582.94s]  What oh oh nice score.
[4582.94s -> 4590.92s]  What? Nice score buddy. What the
[4590.92s -> 4592.28s]  fuck happened there?
[4592.28s -> 4603.88s]  Oh no burst five. You kind of need
[4603.88s -> 4605.16s]  like a goalie huh?
[4605.16s -> 4607.80s]  Yeah. Where's where's your new best
[4607.80s -> 4609.72s]  friend italics?
[4609.72s -> 4611.32s]  Uh I think he's downstairs. I don't
[4611.32s -> 4613.24s]  think he has this game though.
[4613.24s -> 4616.84s]  But that would be three. Oh well then
[4616.84s -> 4617.96s]  I could get someone
[4617.96s -> 4622.58s]  else. I have friends I think.
[4622.58s -> 4626.50s]  I think I have friends. That would be
[4626.50s -> 4627.86s]  unfair.
[4627.86s -> 4631.82s]  How would that be unfair? Oh god.
[4631.82s -> 4633.02s]  With like a two.
[4633.02s -> 4635.10s]  How how does this not hit your goal?
[4635.10s -> 4636.46s]  I pulled it away right before he
[4636.46s -> 4641.06s]  hit it.
[4641.06s -> 4645.21s]  No. Okay that's freaked me out. The music
[4645.21s -> 4646.41s]  just stopped.
[4646.41s -> 4648.41s]  Yeah the music timed it perfectly for
[4648.41s -> 4652.02s]  like.
[4652.02s -> 4665.03s]  Don't you dare. The world. Why don't
[4665.03s -> 4665.99s]  you like you just block.
[4665.99s -> 4668.31s]  Oh that's what we call a super shot.
[4668.31s -> 4678.30s]  That's what they call a super shot.
[4678.30s -> 4680.70s]  I'm just like going don't you dare.
[4680.70s -> 4681.98s]  I'm just like posing in front of
[4681.98s -> 4686.31s]  you.
[4686.31s -> 4688.15s]  That super is really good at this.
[4688.15s -> 4690.47s]  Yeah it is good for this for sure.
[4690.47s -> 4694.87s]  Oh my god I was trying to farm super
[4694.87s -> 4697.11s]  to see if I could do some.
[4697.11s -> 4698.47s]  You're trying to do a super shot but
[4698.47s -> 4699.67s]  come on man.
[4699.67s -> 4727.40s]  Oh my god that is so good.
[4727.40s -> 4747.06s]  I fucked it up. It's all right.
[4747.06s -> 4755.98s]  What?
[4755.98s -> 4770.55s]  Holy shit. Holy shit. Oh you caught it.
[4770.55s -> 4785.18s]  Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.
[4785.18s -> 4797.64s]  Ah that was just too high for me.
[4797.64s -> 4808.78s]  Damn again too high.
[4808.78s -> 4811.99s]  It feels like we got better. Kind of.
[4811.99s -> 4830.09s]  No.
[4830.09s -> 4832.63s]  Tried to be fancy. All right trying to
[4832.63s -> 4834.39s]  see how it works with the baseball.
[4834.39s -> 4844.14s]  I can't believe those plays are legal.
[4844.14s -> 4850.06s]  I'll try.
[4850.06s -> 4851.82s]  He'd probably be really good here.
[4851.82s -> 4860.09s]  Yeah just keep picking op characters.
[4860.09s -> 4862.52s]  Uh see I keep just changing
[4862.52s -> 4863.88s]  characters but you're playing the
[4863.88s -> 4864.76s]  same character.
[4864.76s -> 4867.40s]  He plays ping pong. You're getting to
[4867.40s -> 4869.16s]  know every inch of that one character
[4869.16s -> 4870.28s]  where I'm spreading my knowledge
[4870.28s -> 4872.68s]  across multiple different people.
[4874.79s -> 4880.79s]  Oops that was. Wow that was a pretty
[4880.79s -> 4881.75s]  cool move.
[4881.75s -> 4888.46s]  I'll give you that. Okay I saw you.
[4888.46s -> 4890.06s]  All right I see what you're doing here.
[4890.06s -> 4891.18s]  That's an interesting little play.
[4891.18s -> 4892.30s]  Ain't gonna work again though. I
[4892.30s -> 4904.47s]  mean you know.
[4904.47s -> 4911.19s]  Offense defense. Oh my god that is
[4911.19s -> 4912.47s]  some bullshit.
[4912.47s -> 4913.91s]  I guess at that point I just need to
[4913.91s -> 4923.38s]  defend. Why is it still going?
[4923.38s -> 4928.04s]  It went over it. Oh my god.
[4928.04s -> 4944.57s]  Oh my god. I can't get it.
[4944.57s -> 4948.15s]  Oh my god. I can't touch it. I can't
[4948.15s -> 4954.97s]  touch it.
[4962.63s -> 4977.59s]  Holy shit. I tried to grab it too
[4977.59s -> 4978.55s]  but it said
[4978.55s -> 4985.02s]  it said no. You're lucky.
[4985.02s -> 4986.06s]  I was like holy shit what happened
[4986.06s -> 4993.48s]  there.
[4993.48s -> 5000.44s]  Oh good play. You gotta parry it.
[5000.44s -> 5020.71s]  Oh my god. There's the monster.
[5020.71s -> 5027.85s]  Goodness gracious.
[5027.85s -> 5032.17s]  No. Oh we got. I gotta cheat.
[5032.17s -> 5048.06s]  Oh fuck that was too high.
[5048.06s -> 5078.66s]  Burst. Nice save.

[5391.72s -> 5395.80s]  Okay. I'm with my my main skin and not
[5395.80s -> 5398.60s]  in your home character's stage.
[5398.60s -> 5401.24s]  Why not? That doesn't mean anything.
[5401.24s -> 5403.96s]  It does. Well then it's all random. I
[5403.96s -> 5405.24s]  didn't pick it. No you get plus 10
[5405.24s -> 5407.16s]  speed on your main stage.
[5407.16s -> 5408.94s]  You see you'd like that to be true
[5408.94s -> 5418.42s]  wouldn't you?
[5418.42s -> 5421.69s]  You would like that to be true all
[5421.69s -> 5422.97s]  those years.
[5422.97s -> 5425.29s]  All those years of star beating me
[5425.29s -> 5432.95s]  at everything but this not this time.
[5433.03s -> 5448.63s]  Hit it.
[5460.87s -> 5463.77s]  You gotta let them get one. Otherwise

[5583.99s -> 5585.35s]  through his legs in the world.
[5585.35s -> 5590.58s]  I planned the whole thing. The ball
[5590.58s -> 5591.46s]  went through his legs in the world
[5591.46s -> 5606.34s]  series.
[5606.34s -> 5611.78s]  No. Come on. Come on. Come on. Fundamentals.
[5611.78s -> 5620.65s]  And they blew into the world series.
[5620.65s -> 5622.09s]  Fundamentals.
[5622.09s -> 5626.55s]  God that got cocky at the end there.
[5626.55s -> 5631.72s]  Why beat you at your own game?
[5631.72s -> 5633.08s]  You gotta let him win one. I mean
[5633.08s -> 5634.84s]  he's won one in like four. I mean
[5634.84s -> 5635.96s]  come on. It was inevitable. He can't
[5635.96s -> 5642.94s]  be perfect every time.
[5642.94s -> 5644.86s]  You gotta let him get ten you know.
[5644.86s -> 5647.18s]  Just to build up his overconfidence.
[5647.18s -> 5648.62s]  That's how you hustle. Then you say
[5648.62s -> 5649.82s]  oh the rematch. We'll double

[5692.46s -> 5694.78s]  freaky eater. I'll tell you that.
[5694.78s -> 5697.58s]  You remember freaky eater? How could I
[5697.58s -> 5698.78s]  how could you forget? I don't even

[5731.96s -> 5733.72s]  I'm just like a such a huge fan of
[5733.72s -> 5735.40s]  cheesy potatoes.

[5739.94s -> 5742.74s]  cooking broccoli right now star?
[5742.74s -> 5747.94s]  I tried to block it.

[5776.30s -> 5783.18s]  shit I thought it was gonna hit.
[5784.46s -> 5786.38s]  Sometimes you gotta be aggressive.
[5786.46s -> 5800.65s]  Sometimes. Oh yeah.
[5800.65s -> 5806.20s]  Oh man oh man. I learned that from star.
[5806.20s -> 5809.50s]  Sometimes you gotta be aggressive.
[5811.62s -> 5815.82s]  Come back. Okay you gotta let them get
[5815.82s -> 5818.14s]  10 sometimes.
[5818.14s -> 5821.40s]  You let me get 10 I let you get 10.
[5821.40s -> 5822.44s]  That's how it works.
[5822.44s -> 5824.44s]  By the way level 10 that's a good
[5824.44s -> 5831.16s]  good comment you made there.
[5831.16s -> 5837.82s]  That's not how friendship works.
[5837.82s -> 5839.58s]  You know these guys are wind trading for
[5839.58s -> 5842.46s]  views.
[5842.46s -> 5844.22s]  That's what we're doing. Wind trading.
[5844.22s -> 5845.42s]  No that's that's what everyone's saying
[5845.42s -> 5846.70s]  over here.
[5846.70s -> 5852.25s]  Wind trading. I spell new characters new
[5852.25s -> 5853.29s]  character. What do you mean you spit it
[5853.29s -> 5854.57s]  up? I sped it up.

[5857.53s -> 5858.89s]  do you mean you spit? I don't know.
[5858.89s -> 5860.25s]  Okay excuse me here this is this is
[5860.25s -> 5861.69s]  not regulation. I mean even if I
[5861.69s -> 5864.50s]  lose this it's not regulation.
[5864.50s -> 5865.70s]  You can't just lower the hoop because
[5865.70s -> 5866.58s]  you're not good at shooting the
[5866.58s -> 5873.90s]  basketball.
[5873.90s -> 5880.10s]  Oh you cheat.
[5880.10s -> 5889.90s]  No please. How'd that not go in? I'm
[5889.90s -> 5890.94s]  going to start doing the Vincent
[5890.94s -> 5900.86s]  Price laugh here in a minute man.
[5914.07s -> 5922.76s]  Oh oops now okay now okay I gotta be
[5922.76s -> 5923.80s]  carefully because this
[5923.80s -> 5925.16s]  how this happens sometimes a star
[5925.16s -> 5927.32s]  gets to the point where he's
[5927.32s -> 5929.32s]  he needs to try as hard he's trying
[5929.32s -> 5930.28s]  to get this to happen.
[5930.28s -> 5931.64s]  He's gonna be totally silent he's
[5931.64s -> 5933.08s]  gonna focus he's gonna stop saying
[5933.08s -> 5934.04s]  anything funny.
[5934.04s -> 5935.72s]  I haven't seen anything funny in
[5935.72s -> 5947.99s]  years.
[5948.15s -> 5954.87s]  Feels bad man. You want to parry me? I
[5954.87s -> 5971.30s]  can go for a parry.
[5971.30s -> 5975.22s]  Oh it's so fast. It's like a bomb.
[5975.22s -> 5982.09s]  I don't know what to do.
[5982.09s -> 5999.61s]  Shit. I thought you were too high.
[5999.61s -> 6002.97s]  I was a little bit. Maybe not though.
[6002.97s -> 6016.52s]  All right all right.
[6016.52s -> 6030.92s]  Holy shit that moved around. Oh you
[6030.92s -> 6032.44s]  did a thing with that. You made it
[6032.44s -> 6033.88s]  oh okay all right I see. I did a
[6033.88s -> 6047.11s]  thing with that.
[6047.11s -> 6053.86s]  Oh fucking Jesus. God that's so good.
[6053.86s -> 6057.59s]  It starts off so fast.
[6057.59s -> 6067.51s]  No I have to double jump for that.
[6067.51s -> 6071.56s]  This is a very fun game. This is a
[6071.56s -> 6073.78s]  very fun game.
[6073.78s -> 6075.78s]  Okay I set it back to regulation.
[6075.78s -> 6077.78s]  Are you what? New characters. New characters.
[6077.78s -> 6079.06s]  Oh I don't know if I have enough
[6079.06s -> 6082.50s]  because I have to buy this game mode for you.
[6082.50s -> 6086.36s]  Oh it's shocker from spider-man.
[6086.36s -> 6089.56s]  Yeah I can't afford any walls. Okay this guy looks kind of cool.
[6089.56s -> 6090.60s]  I mean I think it's just because I've
[6090.60s -> 6092.28s]  been winning so much that it's just
[6092.28s -> 6093.96s]  giving me extra points.
[6093.96s -> 6103.58s]  Yeah.
[6103.58s -> 6107.43s]  Yeah. Yeah. Am I coming in?
[6107.43s -> 6115.75s]  Yep what game mode? Am I? The good game mode?
[6115.75s -> 6119.08s]  Uh I mean if you want to like take
[6119.08s -> 6120.52s]  the take this back and like start to
[6120.52s -> 6122.28s]  embarrass me again you could like
[6122.28s -> 6123.56s]  you could do the volleyball game mode
[6123.56s -> 6125.48s]  again. Yeah. Build up a little bit
[6125.48s -> 6127.08s]  more confidence maybe take us into
[6127.08s -> 6129.86s]  the next round you know what I'm saying?
[6129.86s -> 6133.67s]  Who the hell? What? Jack the Ripper? No
[6133.67s -> 6135.35s]  it's shocker from spider-man
[6135.35s -> 6138.58s]  with plugs on his hands. Hmm his name
[6138.58s -> 6143.54s]  is grid because he has a grid.
[6143.54s -> 6145.06s]  I didn't check the costumes. Oh that
[6145.06s -> 6149.42s]  was a mistake. Let's see.

[6152.54s -> 6153.82s]  were doing. Yep. Okay this is the
[6153.82s -> 6167.18s]  this is the volleyball one.
[6185.74s -> 6193.32s]  Whoa that's weird. That's just I just
[6193.32s -> 6194.44s]  can't do this one.

[6282.79s -> 6289.29s]  design? What you hate him why?

[6292.33s -> 6294.22s]  like shit.

[6364.31s -> 6369.93s]  corn field. You found a new outfit to
[6369.93s -> 6371.69s]  unlock for raptor.
[6371.69s -> 6376.02s]  All right let's see the outfits. Okay
[6376.02s -> 6378.04s]  so I can be corn.
[6378.04s -> 6383.54s]  Error texture on wall.
[6383.54s -> 6386.84s]  Funky. I think I'm gonna be texture wall
[6386.84s -> 6389.48s]  error. You kind of have to be corn.
[6389.48s -> 6397.03s]  Oh this one kind of hurts. Let's try
[6397.03s -> 6398.39s]  this one. I've been playing too much soul
[6398.39s -> 6399.75s]  caliber that they just look like bad
[6399.75s -> 6400.71s]  characters
[6400.71s -> 6403.35s]  people create it. Random grid thrown
[6403.35s -> 6405.34s]  on them.
[6405.34s -> 6411.30s]  Well it's not. I feel like this stage has
[6411.30s -> 6412.10s]  a higher ceiling.
[6412.10s -> 6413.86s]  And I tried to go I just like
[6413.86s -> 6415.62s]  cracked my neck so hard. I like almost
[6415.62s -> 6422.86s]  just this whole stage is just bigger.
[6422.86s -> 6425.02s]  Damn it. Damn it man. I just got no
[6425.02s -> 6427.26s]  patience. I got no patience.
[6427.26s -> 6439.05s]  And I try I got I got no patience man.
[6439.05s -> 6440.89s]  You got to do 100 000 miles per hour.
[6440.89s -> 6443.45s]  100 miles per hour or or bust.
[6443.45s -> 6445.53s]  Oh no patience. I had no patience on
[6445.53s -> 6446.57s]  that one. See if I just waited I
[6446.57s -> 6447.93s]  could have got it.
[6447.93s -> 6461.37s]  I went the wrong fucking way. I have no
[6461.37s -> 6462.89s]  patience. All right just let just let
[6462.89s -> 6463.93s]  him play himself.
[6463.93s -> 6479.29s]  Don't even move. What the hell. I tried
[6479.29s -> 6480.57s]  to press x.
[6480.65s -> 6482.33s]  It was too hard to press a different
[6482.33s -> 6484.81s]  button. I just my fucking fat fingers
[6484.81s -> 6489.88s]  went all over it.
[6489.88s -> 6491.64s]  Oh by the way um if you if you don't
[6491.64s -> 6492.84s]  know how the game mode works
[6492.84s -> 6494.20s]  and the game works. So there's two
[6494.20s -> 6495.48s]  sides. All right you got red versus
[6495.48s -> 6496.28s]  blue
[6496.28s -> 6499.40s]  and there's a ball that is just goes
[6499.40s -> 6500.60s]  back and forth between the two
[6500.60s -> 6502.20s]  entities.
[6502.20s -> 6504.55s]  Yeah that was a good one.
[6504.55s -> 6506.71s]  And I'm fucking just can't do this
[6506.71s -> 6508.07s]  like game mode.
[6508.07s -> 6512.68s]  I can't do it.
[6512.68s -> 6519.14s]  All right like all right let me
[6519.14s -> 6520.18s]  explain.
[6520.18s -> 6523.54s]  It's volleyball. No no but like the the
[6523.54s -> 6525.46s]  core video game itself.
[6525.46s -> 6527.30s]  It's like hey here's a porsche and
[6527.30s -> 6528.74s]  you're on the autobahn.
[6528.74s -> 6530.90s]  But please go 10 miles per hour sir.
[6530.90s -> 6531.86s]  It's like no you're gonna you're
[6531.86s -> 6535.38s]  gonna go a fucking hundred.
[6535.38s -> 6545.40s]  No. So what you're saying is you
[6545.40s -> 6547.16s]  you spent all the money on a porsche
[6547.16s -> 6549.56s]  and you finally you know you have a
[6549.56s -> 6550.44s]  porsche
[6550.44s -> 6551.88s]  and then you get there and it
[6551.88s -> 6554.15s]  doesn't even have internet.
[6554.15s -> 6555.91s]  No no you had you buy a porsche and
[6555.91s -> 6556.95s]  it's like oh by the way this thing
[6556.95s -> 6558.95s]  can go zero to a hundred and point two
[6558.95s -> 6560.47s]  seconds. It's like holy shit wow.
[6560.47s -> 6562.63s]  And then they put the porsche between
[6562.63s -> 6564.23s]  like one old lady in front of you and
[6564.23s -> 6565.75s]  one old lady behind you.
[6565.75s -> 6567.03s]  And so you can't go anywhere. You just
[6567.03s -> 6569.51s]  to go 15 miles per hour on the
[6569.51s -> 6569.99s]  autobahn.
[6569.99s -> 6571.11s]  What does that have to do with this
[6571.11s -> 6572.87s]  game? I don't get the comparison.
[6572.87s -> 6574.71s]  Because it's fast. It's a fast game
[6574.71s -> 6576.23s]  with like back and forth crazy
[6576.23s -> 6577.35s]  speeds and then it's like I gotta
[6577.35s -> 6579.70s]  drive behind an old lady.
[6579.70s -> 6580.82s]  What's the old lady in this
[6580.82s -> 6583.22s]  scenario? This this game mode
[6583.22s -> 6584.18s]  volleyball.
[6584.18s -> 6586.78s]  We're playing it again and then we
[6586.78s -> 6588.22s]  can play your stupid
[6588.22s -> 6591.58s]  casual game mode. Oh yeah.
[6591.58s -> 6600.04s]  Oh the casual mode. Game mode is an old
[6600.04s -> 6601.08s]  lady.
[6601.08s -> 6614.20s]  So yeah are you the old lady in this
[6614.20s -> 6615.40s]  scenario?
[6615.40s -> 6618.78s]  No you are. Because you want to go so
[6618.78s -> 6619.74s]  slow and I want to go
[6619.74s -> 6631.43s]  fast on the fucking highway. That ball
[6631.43s -> 6632.71s]  went pretty fast
[6632.71s -> 6637.66s]  right by you. I mean why even play
[6637.66s -> 6638.94s]  the other game mode if you can't
[6638.94s -> 6640.62s]  play the slow one? I think it'd be
[6640.62s -> 6642.14s]  too much for you.
[6646.55s -> 6651.82s]  Turn around. Psycho driver.
[6651.82s -> 6656.89s]  Psycho. Psycho driver.
[6656.89s -> 6659.13s]  What?
[6659.13s -> 6660.33s]  It's all about speed. That's gonna
[6660.33s -> 6669.32s]  keep moving around.
[6669.32s -> 6676.20s]  I man I saved you.
[6676.20s -> 6678.04s]  Just keep driving. I'm going too fast.
[6678.04s -> 6679.00s]  Out of the middle.
[6696.46s -> 6697.66s]  I don't like how the stage is
[6697.66s -> 6706.84s]  actually moving the camera.
[6706.92s -> 6708.92s]  Why did I hit it again?
[6708.92s -> 6710.50s]  Why did I?
[6710.50s -> 6711.94s]  Why did I do that again?
[6711.94s -> 6717.03s]  Why is it kind of good? I hit it. I hit it right there. It's done.
[6717.03s -> 6722.50s]  I did it. Okay I'm fine.
[6722.50s -> 6728.74s]  Wow. Turn around. You're jumping around
[6728.74s -> 6730.42s]  it's it's driving me crazy the way it's
[6730.42s -> 6732.02s]  moving the camera. Like this stage is
[6732.02s -> 6735.78s]  just like a pixel too big.
[6739.03s -> 6742.42s]  Oh look out. That's fucked up because I
[6742.42s -> 6744.10s]  have to jump then turn around in the
[6744.10s -> 6745.38s]  air to hit it but if you press
[6745.38s -> 6746.82s]  forward then it doesn't
[6746.82s -> 6748.26s]  it goes into the ground. Well I'm sorry
[6748.26s -> 6751.85s]  I have to move. You don't.
[6751.85s -> 6754.95s]  Yes I do. You don't have to move.
[6754.95s -> 6756.47s]  Don't you understand? Like I'm playing
[6756.47s -> 6757.43s]  better now because I'm moving
[6757.43s -> 6758.55s]  around.
[6758.55s -> 6770.68s]  We're not just going like this.
[6770.68s -> 6773.29s]  Wow really? Okay yeah that's really
[6773.29s -> 6774.42s]  dumb.
[6774.42s -> 6776.34s]  Nice game fucking shitty
[6776.34s -> 6778.26s]  developers. Got you.
[6778.26s -> 6779.86s]  We're playing on a stage. We're one
[6779.86s -> 6781.30s]  more of volleyball because I know
[6781.30s -> 6782.42s]  you're you're sad you're stuck
[6782.42s -> 6783.70s]  behind this old lady but we have to
[6783.70s -> 6785.94s]  play one more
[6785.94s -> 6787.22s]  and you're gonna you're gonna vote
[6787.22s -> 6790.14s]  for the
[6790.14s -> 6796.12s]  the white stage. Okay.
[6796.12s -> 6798.60s]  So screen doesn't it still is. Oh but
[6798.60s -> 6800.28s]  I have to admit you lost one game.
[6800.28s -> 6802.12s]  Like come on man.
[6802.12s -> 6832.65s]  Okay nice catch.
[6839.67s -> 6845.99s]  Did I just wait did I say oof? I did
[6845.99s -> 6847.35s]  not say oof.
[6847.35s -> 6879.88s]  Did I? No. Can I aim that down? I'm so
[6879.88s -> 6881.32s]  afraid to hit it down.
[6881.32s -> 6888.68s]  Got it. That was a great volley damn
[6888.76s -> 6891.42s]  bad.
[6891.42s -> 6904.98s]  I bunted and you just slammed it.
[6904.98s -> 6907.38s]  Ah I did it a little too far away. What was I
[6907.38s -> 6909.78s]  doing? What was I thinking?
[6909.78s -> 6915.02s]  See you did it too. Because you have to
[6915.02s -> 6916.46s]  turn around and you have to press
[6916.46s -> 6917.98s]  forward. I'm realizing where the suck
[6917.98s -> 6925.08s]  is.
[6925.08s -> 6926.12s]  Oh I don't know what happened there
[6926.12s -> 6953.78s]  but I'll take it.
[6953.78s -> 6956.34s]  I tried. I tried. Don't don't lose it
[6956.34s -> 6959.99s]  here. I lost it and I fucking just.
[6959.99s -> 6974.36s]  Silent tryhard.
[6974.36s -> 6977.56s]  What the fuck was that? What the hell?
[6977.56s -> 6979.72s]  That was just return that one.
[6979.72s -> 6982.12s]  And I'm ready for the ball. I wasn't
[6982.12s -> 6983.08s]  even ready for the ball.
[6983.08s -> 6984.52s]  I'm going to shake it off. Sometimes
[6984.52s -> 6985.80s]  somebody hits a home run pitcher. Come
[6985.80s -> 7006.38s]  on.
[7006.38s -> 7011.34s]  Curve. I went I tried to go up and it
[7011.34s -> 7011.98s]  didn't do it.
[7011.98s -> 7014.46s]  I can't even karamba. I can't even
[7014.46s -> 7031.21s]  karumba.
[7031.21s -> 7033.13s]  What? Did we both reach through the
[7033.13s -> 7034.65s]  you reached through the net. I blocked
[7034.65s -> 7035.13s]  you.
[7035.13s -> 7039.14s]  I blocked you.
[7039.61s -> 7043.21s]  I did it. I did it. I fucking was.
[7043.21s -> 7066.78s]  Spin around. You're good. Oh nice.
[7066.78s -> 7085.64s]  Good volley. Oh right on the.
[7085.64s -> 7087.96s]  I was too busy marveling over the
[7087.96s -> 7088.92s]  bounce.
[7088.92s -> 7090.92s]  I was marveling over the bounce on
[7090.92s -> 7092.76s]  the net and Eddie you did the curve
[7092.76s -> 7093.24s]  ball.
[7093.24s -> 7099.70s]  Okay what game mode do you want?
[7099.70s -> 7101.45s]  Regular.
[7101.45s -> 7107.08s]  Regular game mode. I can't rematch
[7107.08s -> 7107.88s]  again.
[7107.88s -> 7112.78s]  I have to force quit. Wow.
[7112.78s -> 7119.24s]  It's a shame. All right don't delete OBS.
[7119.24s -> 7124.01s]  Okay coming back. You have to rematch
[7124.01s -> 7127.11s]  before he changes the game mode.
[7127.11s -> 7137.02s]  Well coming back. Team reptile
[7137.02s -> 7148.04s]  joining your game.
[7148.04s -> 7149.80s]  I want to try this guy in regular
[7149.80s -> 7152.82s]  mode. Okay. I feel like he's
[7152.82s -> 7159.66s]  he has potential. Where are we going?
[7159.66s -> 7161.26s]  Have we even played here?
[7161.26s -> 7163.90s]  Played where? Here. I just unlocked
[7163.90s -> 7168.02s]  new stages. Oh okay. Is it still oh
[7168.02s -> 7177.82s]  it's still on like super fast mode.
[7177.82s -> 7180.66s]  Whoa. He teleports forward and then
[7180.66s -> 7199.08s]  shoots it.
[7199.08s -> 7201.46s]  I don't. It was because it was my serve
[7201.46s -> 7203.13s]  at auto parry.
[7203.13s -> 7212.89s]  Oh I was trying to queue up like a
[7212.89s -> 7218.65s]  huge one.
[7218.65s -> 7236.30s]  Oh I'm afraid you keep meter in between rounds on this one.
[7236.30s -> 7238.30s]  It's less climactic when it starts
[7238.30s -> 7239.42s]  fast.
[7239.42s -> 7242.46s]  Yeah it's a little too fast.
[7242.46s -> 7244.70s]  See this is the equivalent of being
[7244.70s -> 7246.38s]  on the highway and you. We're doing
[7246.38s -> 7248.62s]  tournament regulation.
[7248.62s -> 7254.14s]  Regulation tournament. Damn it's not.
[7254.14s -> 7262.98s]  Are you gonna main grid corn man?
[7262.98s -> 7264.82s]  Where's the other stage?
[7264.82s -> 7268.74s]  Um the street. The subway one.
[7268.74s -> 7270.50s]  Oh god that's a lot going on in the
[7270.50s -> 7272.90s]  background.
[7291.35s -> 7294.95s]  What the fuck? Ultra.
[7294.95s -> 7299.14s]  Oh god. It's what it bounced like
[7299.14s -> 7300.74s]  like three times behind me. Those
[7300.82s -> 7317.59s]  bounces didn't make sense.
[7317.59s -> 7320.54s]  I'm just gonna let it happen. You know
[7320.54s -> 7321.42s]  what I'm saying? Like sometimes you just
[7321.42s -> 7324.28s]  gotta let. Whoa.
[7324.28s -> 7334.10s]  What? I promise you I did that.
[7334.10s -> 7336.94s]  That is so confusing. Yeah that's
[7336.94s -> 7339.74s]  really good.
[7339.74s -> 7341.26s]  Oh shit I thought it hit you. Did it?
[7341.26s -> 7346.26s]  It did. Uh oh. Uh stink ball.
[7346.26s -> 7348.36s]  What? I don't know what happened.
[7348.36s -> 7349.88s]  You're cheating.
[7349.88s -> 7351.88s]  I didn't do anything. You hey you're
[7351.88s -> 7352.92s]  the one that you're the one playing
[7352.92s -> 7361.40s]  with items. Items are on by default.
[7361.40s -> 7365.35s]  Ah I was trying to invisible.
[7365.35s -> 7374.38s]  What am I doing? Oh is it invisible?
[7374.38s -> 7375.58s]  I guess.
[7375.58s -> 7389.24s]  That's weird.
[7389.24s -> 7392.54s]  Oh my god does he also say Cho?
[7392.54s -> 7394.62s]  Tournament standard regulation match.
[7394.62s -> 7399.29s]  Now who put items on?
[7399.29s -> 7401.56s]  Do I turn them off?
[7401.56s -> 7403.24s]  How is that standard tournament mode?
[7403.24s -> 7408.62s]  Because it's on by default.
[7408.62s -> 7414.74s]  Oh oh you're going for uh.
[7414.74s -> 7418.84s]  I'm going for big boy.
[7418.84s -> 7422.81s]  You know what you know what corn is
[7422.81s -> 7423.93s]  weak to?
[7423.93s -> 7428.76s]  Sound.
[7428.76s -> 7432.12s]  That would be crazy. Oh crazy if true.
[7432.12s -> 7455.78s]  Ow my head. Oh shit.
[7455.78s -> 7474.50s]  Oh where did it go? Damn.
[7474.50s -> 7477.14s]  Damn it. Oh my god it double tapped me.
[7477.14s -> 7478.26s]  It went bang bang.
[7478.26s -> 7482.22s]  Standing up is hard sometimes.
[7482.22s -> 7484.14s]  Oh you keep your health between rounds.
[7484.14s -> 7493.88s]  I didn't realize that.
[7493.88s -> 7509.11s]  Shit. What the hell was happening
[7509.11s -> 7510.87s]  there? I know I have a hover I just
[7510.87s -> 7524.09s]  okay I hold it that way.
[7524.17s -> 7550.78s]  Shit. All right this you have no health
[7550.78s -> 7552.14s]  man. I have one yeah I know I'm gonna
[7552.14s -> 7555.34s]  make it perfect.
[7555.34s -> 7557.26s]  I knew you're gonna do it. I knew you
[7557.26s -> 7558.54s]  were gonna do it. I just needed a little
[7558.54s -> 7563.13s]  tiny tap.
[7563.13s -> 7564.41s]  I knew it was gonna happen too and I
[7564.41s -> 7565.45s]  was trying to prepare for it and
[7565.45s -> 7566.73s]  preparing for it is what caused me a
[7566.73s -> 7567.69s]  problem.
[7567.69s -> 7581.02s]  Play this guy. Ready. Wow didn't you
[7581.02s -> 7583.11s]  dress up like that for Halloween?
[7583.11s -> 7587.94s]  Like this? Yeah with the claw and the
[7587.94s -> 7589.46s]  hook.
[7589.46s -> 7590.66s]  How would I dress up for a guy for
[7590.66s -> 7593.22s]  Halloween? I didn't know who he is.
[7593.22s -> 7595.22s]  You don't make any logical sense. I
[7595.22s -> 7596.82s]  thought you made this game.
[7596.82s -> 7622.89s]  It'd be so weird if I did. Oh what
[7622.89s -> 7624.81s]  happened? Did you seriously parry right
[7624.81s -> 7625.45s]  there at the end?
[7625.45s -> 7635.34s]  Yeah. Oops. Wait hold on wait wait
[7635.34s -> 7636.46s]  wait what?
[7636.46s -> 7637.50s]  I don't think you can hit it when
[7637.50s -> 7639.26s]  it's in the bubble. So what's in the
[7639.26s -> 7640.62s]  bubble it can't be hit. I don't think
[7640.62s -> 7641.66s]  okay.
[7641.66s -> 7644.22s]  That's interesting. That changes things
[7644.22s -> 7645.42s]  a little bit makes it that makes her
[7645.42s -> 7656.06s]  special better.
[7656.06s -> 7658.78s]  Shit. Oh man. Yeah it's pretty good.
[7658.78s -> 7663.13s]  That's tough.
[7663.13s -> 7665.69s]  That went so fast. I just threw it at
[7665.69s -> 7680.89s]  you.
[7680.89s -> 7696.18s]  Jumping into this one. Freaking noob.
[7696.18s -> 7699.62s]  Just using throws.
[7700.70s -> 7706.06s]  The bros. I can't parry it if it's in
[7706.06s -> 7714.26s]  there okay.
[7714.26s -> 7720.10s]  I like her. Game. Yeah I know what I'm
[7720.10s -> 7721.46s]  playing. You don't have to tell me
[7721.46s -> 7725.42s]  game.
[7725.42s -> 7726.86s]  I feel like uh I feel like star is
[7726.86s -> 7728.62s]  gonna play as this character
[7728.62s -> 7732.28s]  on his on ranked mode. I used to play
[7732.28s -> 7733.32s]  in the real world
[7733.32s -> 7736.97s]  with the the roller blades. Really? Yeah
[7736.97s -> 7739.67s]  back in the day.
[7739.67s -> 7741.69s]  That's pretty cool. Did you actually
[7741.69s -> 7742.89s]  roll it around? Do you know how to
[7742.89s -> 7743.45s]  roll it?
[7743.45s -> 7746.73s]  Yeah I was I went to the skate parks
[7746.73s -> 7748.33s]  and everything.
[7748.33s -> 7754.60s]  Fruit dooder. An itchy eye and it's
[7754.60s -> 7755.32s]  gonna fuck me up.
[7755.32s -> 7772.60s]  Itchy eye syndrome here it comes. Nice.
[7772.60s -> 7774.68s]  Um so now that this game's uh
[7774.68s -> 7776.84s]  like relevant again right
[7776.84s -> 7777.72s]  do you think something like this
[7777.72s -> 7779.24s]  would show up at EVO?
[7779.24s -> 7782.10s]  Um because that would be
[7782.10s -> 7783.54s]  how cool would that be? I would love to
[7783.54s -> 7784.90s]  see this at EVO but I don't think it
[7784.90s -> 7788.86s]  will.
[7788.86s -> 7789.98s]  I thought you were either gonna. That'd be
[7789.98s -> 7794.52s]  so fun. Just put it in like the
[7794.52s -> 7796.04s]  comedy slot right? Isn't there always
[7796.04s -> 7797.08s]  like a comedy slot
[7797.08s -> 7803.53s]  for EVO? Is there? I don't know. Is there like just a comedy slot?
[7803.53s -> 7804.97s]  I mean there's a lot of side tournaments
[7804.97s -> 7806.09s]  that are run that aren't on the
[7806.09s -> 7807.45s]  main stage.
[7807.45s -> 7808.65s]  So that they don't do like a four
[7808.65s -> 7810.17s]  fun like just little fun like
[7810.17s -> 7812.65s]  session it's all just all competitive?
[7812.65s -> 7816.39s]  Uh no. Like what if they think they
[7816.39s -> 7817.67s]  got like Burger King to sponsor it
[7817.67s -> 7819.03s]  and you got like
[7819.03s -> 7820.79s]  like three like meals for like a
[7820.79s -> 7822.15s]  week or something?
[7822.15s -> 7825.91s]  Free meals for a week. I don't know.
[7825.91s -> 7829.38s]  Stand-up comedy at EVO. Yeah. Who's the
[7829.38s -> 7830.82s]  best stand-up comedian? They already do
[7830.82s -> 7832.90s]  that shit. They do like comedy
[7832.90s -> 7846.66s]  of battles. No don't do it. Jesus.
[7846.66s -> 7850.76s]  Fuck. Yeah wowee wowee wowee wow.
[7850.76s -> 7853.16s]  It was my last life I've been on man.
[7853.16s -> 7860.41s]  Oh no.
[7860.41s -> 7862.86s]  Oh I don't know what to do.
[7862.86s -> 7869.42s]  Oh my god I jumped right into it. I
[7869.42s -> 7870.62s]  don't know. I like her but I also
[7870.62s -> 7871.74s]  have a much harder time.
[7871.74s -> 7876.07s]  I think it's the skin. Does Jerma think
[7876.07s -> 7878.73s]  EVO is run by Comedy Central?
[7878.73s -> 7881.29s]  Where's the comedy section? Look I I
[7881.29s -> 7881.93s]  know I
[7881.93s -> 7883.77s]  hold on. Wait let me like explain
[7883.77s -> 7886.66s]  myself here. I know that EVO is like
[7886.66s -> 7888.26s]  all the major tournaments is where and
[7888.26s -> 7889.62s]  all the big ones
[7889.62s -> 7892.98s]  and you got like uh Mortal Kombat um
[7892.98s -> 7894.66s]  Injustice.
[7894.66s -> 7897.86s]  That's the comedy section. Smash Brothers.
[7897.86s -> 7899.30s]  Yeah I did you know you don't think I
[7899.30s -> 7900.66s]  know this?
[7900.74s -> 7904.33s]  Yeah but like what are you talking about?
[7904.33s -> 7906.17s]  Like they don't have just like a like a
[7906.17s -> 7907.37s]  show match type
[7907.37s -> 7908.65s]  game or anything where people just play
[7908.65s -> 7910.97s]  for fun? Or is it only only only?
[7910.97s -> 7914.38s]  He said side tournaments. I'm saying not
[7914.38s -> 7916.22s]  every game is streamed
[7916.22s -> 7921.29s]  but there's still tournaments. I'm just
[7921.29s -> 7922.01s]  like
[7922.01s -> 7924.41s]  I'm just baiting right now. That's
[7924.41s -> 7925.37s]  what I'm doing guys. Like just
[7925.37s -> 7926.41s]  anytime you say something stupid just
[7926.41s -> 7927.29s]  like you're just fucking baiting you
[7927.29s -> 7929.21s]  know.
[7929.21s -> 7931.75s]  Doesn't matter you know what I'm
[7931.75s -> 7932.87s]  just baiting.
[7932.87s -> 7935.35s]  Just baiting. Me too. Every night just
[7935.35s -> 7938.65s]  baiting.
[7938.65s -> 7940.49s]  You really like you really okay it's so
[7940.49s -> 7941.61s]  it's been a while since you and I have
[7941.61s -> 7943.77s]  like really played a game together.
[7943.77s -> 7945.29s]  You've really like dialed up to sexual
[7945.29s -> 7946.41s]  humor a little bit haven't you?
[7946.41s -> 7947.69s]  You're like a second are you a sexual
[7947.69s -> 7950.33s]  humor comedy channel now? I uh
[7950.33s -> 7951.93s]  I go to EVO for the sexual humor
[7951.93s -> 7954.49s]  comedy
[7954.49s -> 7958.15s]  I win every year. Like I don't have a
[7958.15s -> 7959.83s]  star making like like like being at
[7959.83s -> 7972.78s]  like the sexual comedy show.
[7972.86s -> 7974.74s]  Nobody must
[7974.74s -> 7985.43s]  damn it. Nitro knockout.
[7985.43s -> 8002.65s]  Nice catch. Ah I thought it was gonna
[8002.65s -> 8004.33s]  bounce around the other side. Shit
[8004.33s -> 8012.71s]  I thought it was gonna go to the left.
[8012.71s -> 8015.27s]  Shit. Oh I'm in trouble here. I'm in
[8015.27s -> 8021.51s]  trouble.
[8021.51s -> 8037.88s]  Come on I'm on my last leg here. Oh
[8037.88s -> 8041.40s]  my god.
[8041.40s -> 8049.66s]  Ah quit quit hardcore
[8049.66s -> 8051.98s]  tryharding. That's what you have to do
[8051.98s -> 8053.67s]  in this game.
[8053.67s -> 8056.07s]  This is why would you try hard in the
[8056.07s -> 8058.07s]  comedy game.
[8058.07s -> 8066.58s]  That's what I don't get.
[8066.58s -> 8077.24s]  No that's not what I meant and you
[8077.24s -> 8078.04s]  know it.
[8078.04s -> 8081.00s]  I don't know what you meant still.
[8081.00s -> 8082.60s]  Quit taking my words out of fucking
[8082.60s -> 8084.60s]  comedy context okay?
[8084.60s -> 8090.54s]  Bam bam bam.
[8090.54s -> 8104.82s]  Ow. Shit it's always the worst when
[8104.82s -> 8105.86s]  you're right in the middle.
[8105.86s -> 8117.74s]  Or you can move. Oh you saw that
[8117.74s -> 8119.50s]  coming from a mile away didn't you?
[8119.50s -> 8132.98s]  Oh my god. What the hell what the
[8132.98s -> 8134.26s]  fuck?
[8134.26s -> 8136.18s]  That like did a full circle it came
[8136.18s -> 8137.38s]  backwards.
[8137.38s -> 8147.80s]  Who grabbed it? I did.
[8147.80s -> 8149.64s]  Oh I think I think gamer exhaustion is
[8149.64s -> 8160.06s]  starting to get in here.
[8160.06s -> 8161.66s]  I don't know what happened. I think you
[8161.66s -> 8163.18s]  grabbed it out of my hand. I caught it
[8163.18s -> 8164.70s]  like right after you hit it I
[8164.70s -> 8165.74s]  caught it.
[8165.74s -> 8177.22s]  Ow my joints. I need to drink a
[8177.22s -> 8178.98s]  stamina potion.
[8178.98s -> 8181.29s]  God if only those existed in real
[8181.29s -> 8198.87s]  life. Come get some.
[8198.87s -> 8201.99s]  Oh come on you bastard you timed it
[8201.99s -> 8204.07s]  you waited for it and you flicked it.
[8204.07s -> 8207.96s]  You flicked the button and it was in.
[8207.96s -> 8209.64s]  Yeah you got you got stamina potions
[8209.64s -> 8211.00s]  over there. I don't have any here.
[8211.00s -> 8212.36s]  Dude I took a stamina potion right
[8212.36s -> 8214.54s]  before this.
[8214.54s -> 8217.18s]  And you had the stamina copy. Did you
[8217.18s -> 8218.38s]  not? No but
[8218.38s -> 8220.38s]  but that but but caught the stamina
[8220.38s -> 8222.30s]  coffee puts you up to like a hundred
[8222.30s -> 8223.42s]  percent stamina.
[8223.42s -> 8225.34s]  But then you drain rate is like plus
[8225.34s -> 8226.54s]  a hundred percent. What are you?
[8226.54s -> 8228.86s]  So I I would have a hundred percent
[8228.86s -> 8231.38s]  stamina.
[8231.38s -> 8234.17s]  What? The German that lived in Boston
[8234.17s -> 8236.25s]  didn't do drugs.
[8236.25s -> 8240.42s]  Why are you bringing us back here? I
[8240.42s -> 8242.26s]  don't know. I have fun doing this.
[8242.26s -> 8251.80s]  Drugs are bad. I don't do I don't do
[8251.80s -> 8253.08s]  drugs.
[8253.08s -> 8256.73s]  Don't listen to this dweeb. Oh it's the
[8256.73s -> 8257.93s]  beach ball again. I didn't even
[8257.93s -> 8259.21s]  realize. I didn't mean to have a
[8259.21s -> 8260.65s]  beach ball.
[8260.65s -> 8266.94s]  You're not gonna like respond to the
[8266.94s -> 8268.46s]  fact that I spelled you dweeb. I
[8268.46s -> 8269.66s]  don't
[8269.66s -> 8274.25s]  have a problem with that.
[8274.25s -> 8281.46s]  Oh you dweeb.
[8281.46s -> 8294.02s]  Bunted it for you. Damn.
[8294.02s -> 8299.43s]  This beat is pumping. Can I score
[8299.43s -> 8300.63s]  a point
[8300.63s -> 8303.83s]  real fast? I can't. I tried. Should I
[8303.83s -> 8305.35s]  should you? I mean there. Yeah I let
[8305.35s -> 8306.87s]  you do it. I was like
[8306.87s -> 8308.15s]  I was like you know it's time for him
[8308.15s -> 8312.36s]  to get one.
[8312.36s -> 8314.20s]  Ah too bad it wasn't at the right
[8314.20s -> 8319.83s]  spot.
[8319.83s -> 8333.91s]  Ah. Oh fuck fuck fuck. Give me one
[8333.91s -> 8335.27s]  that's fucking to beat.
[8335.27s -> 8357.64s]  Oh going for a little move there.
[8357.64s -> 8372.44s]  Oh just out of reach. Fucking beach
[8372.44s -> 8375.08s]  ball.
[8375.08s -> 8380.01s]  No. I actually with beach ball I don't
[8380.01s -> 8381.13s]  like if you had two people I don't
[8381.13s -> 8382.89s]  know how you'd ever score.
[8383.72s -> 8386.52s]  That would be very hard. Nice. Unless you
[8386.52s -> 8387.16s]  have some
[8387.16s -> 8395.51s]  superb extreme donors spotted.
[8395.51s -> 8398.39s]  Nice okay he's finally getting into
[8398.39s -> 8415.37s]  it isn't he?
[8415.37s -> 8424.66s]  Oh that's unfortunate. Damn I was
[8424.66s -> 8425.86s]  waiting for the defense I couldn't
[8425.86s -> 8440.81s]  get it.
[8440.81s -> 8442.41s]  Shit I tried to blunt it up higher
[8442.41s -> 8447.51s]  so you couldn't get it.
[8447.51s -> 8458.76s]  Okay I jumped over just a little too
[8458.76s -> 8459.48s]  high. Oh
[8459.48s -> 8460.68s]  I can't believe you grabbed it a
[8460.68s -> 8463.64s]  second time. Oh that was it.
[8463.64s -> 8466.68s]  That was it.
[8469.83s -> 8471.59s]  What game mode? What's the situation? What are we
[8471.59s -> 8472.89s]  doing?
[8472.89s -> 8474.65s]  Um I don't know what do you think? I
[8474.65s -> 8476.30s]  like that.
[8476.30s -> 8479.69s]  You having fun? I like that. How long
[8479.69s -> 8480.17s]  have we been?
[8480.17s -> 8482.33s]  I mean my stream turned off. I turned
[8482.33s -> 8483.29s]  off my stream
[8483.29s -> 8485.05s]  accidentally so two and a half hours.
[8485.05s -> 8493.75s]  22 minutes.
[8493.75s -> 8500.74s]  222. You cheated super hard there
[8500.74s -> 8507.37s]  which is what because I bumped it.
[8508.25s -> 8512.87s]  I just passed it to you. This with four
[8512.87s -> 8513.83s]  people would be
[8513.83s -> 8516.07s]  I think actually really hard to score a
[8516.07s -> 8517.59s]  goal. It would be like just pretty
[8517.59s -> 8518.23s]  random.
[8518.23s -> 8521.90s]  Yeah it'd be a lot of like mashing
[8521.90s -> 8522.94s]  next to the goal post
[8522.94s -> 8525.98s]  and getting parries I assume.
[8525.98s -> 8531.27s]  It'd actually be kind of doable with
[8531.27s -> 8533.51s]  the baseball though.
[8533.51s -> 8545.27s]  I thought that was too low. Play lego
[8545.27s -> 8546.39s]  island.
[8546.39s -> 8560.42s]  What?
[8560.90s -> 8565.06s]  That's like just that's just too much.
[8565.06s -> 8571.11s]  I will somebody I will never give up
[8571.11s -> 8572.55s]  trying to get me to play
[8572.55s -> 8581.42s]  lego island. Can you guys play lethal
[8581.42s -> 8582.70s]  league blaze?
[8582.70s -> 8588.38s]  I don't know. Soon we'll play it
[8588.38s -> 8593.29s]  after this.
[8593.29s -> 8598.92s]  I'm facing the fucking wrong way. What
[8598.92s -> 8608.17s]  the hell am I doing?
[8608.17s -> 8613.06s]  I'd be down for lego island to be
[8613.06s -> 8614.66s]  honest.
[8614.66s -> 8620.52s]  Lego island. I don't think
[8620.52s -> 8621.80s]  I can even run that game on my
[8621.80s -> 8623.72s]  fucking computer.
[8623.72s -> 8632.58s]  Oh fuck whoops a daisy whoops a daisy.
[8632.58s -> 8645.51s]  Dinosaur.
[8645.51s -> 8658.47s]  Do it like you do drugs. Yeah like
[8658.47s -> 8659.03s]  when you get
[8659.03s -> 8660.39s]  next to the next sometimes it's hard
[8660.39s -> 8662.15s]  to even tell like what happened
[8662.15s -> 8663.03s]  there.
[8663.03s -> 8681.61s]  I thought you're gonna hit it up.
[8681.61s -> 8691.00s]  Oh okay all right nice.
[8691.00s -> 8696.92s]  Oh and he literally missed that.
[8696.92s -> 8699.24s]  Now that's he has a snort key mode oh
[8699.24s -> 8702.10s]  god.
[8702.10s -> 8706.63s]  I can't fucking break. So what's the
[8706.63s -> 8707.75s]  deal?
[8707.75s -> 8709.67s]  What's what deal? Another you want to
[8709.67s -> 8711.99s]  keep doing this one? I enjoy this.
[8711.99s -> 8713.83s]  Okay I'm gonna change character ah
[8713.83s -> 8715.66s]  never mind.
[8715.66s -> 8719.02s]  I'm not gonna change character. It's a
[8719.02s -> 8720.22s]  very it's a very uh
[8720.22s -> 8724.65s]  engaging you know tug of war. It's a very
[8724.65s -> 8725.53s]  engaging
[8725.53s -> 8740.87s]  game. Tug of war back and forth. I was
[8740.87s -> 8742.23s]  like trying to wait for you to do.
[8742.23s -> 8743.35s]  Yeah I was trying to wait for you
[8743.35s -> 8744.31s]  to do.
[8744.31s -> 8750.89s]  We're getting to that next level.
[8750.89s -> 8758.87s]  Ability sucks. You already had enough to
[8758.87s -> 8760.42s]  use that?
[8760.42s -> 8774.95s]  Yeah. Suck dude you suck. I'm gonna do
[8774.95s -> 8775.75s]  like the form
[8775.75s -> 8781.75s]  formation. Oh oh.
[8781.75s -> 8800.52s]  You suck. You suck.
[8803.98s -> 8807.90s]  Fucking move. I had to use mine more. That move is so good.
[8807.90s -> 8815.99s]  Okay okay see now that I'm now that I'm
[8815.99s -> 8817.35s]  close to losing everyone knows from
[8817.35s -> 8818.87s]  Soul Calibur then now now's when we
[8818.87s -> 8820.23s]  try. Now's when we come back we
[8820.23s -> 8821.99s]  kick your ass.
[8821.99s -> 8825.48s]  And maybe I'll go there and kick your
[8825.48s -> 8827.85s]  ass.
[8827.85s -> 8829.05s]  Here's what you know here's where it
[8829.05s -> 8831.45s]  really you know balls to the walls.
[8831.45s -> 8833.05s]  Maybe you'll see me on the
[8833.05s -> 8834.89s]  battlefield and smash to kick your
[8834.89s -> 8851.67s]  ass.
[8851.67s -> 8854.07s]  Yeah learning from the
[8854.07s -> 8862.38s]  learning from the master I see. Does
[8862.38s -> 8864.62s]  that thing just auto target?
[8864.62s -> 8868.34s]  No I have to I have to aim it. I
[8868.34s -> 8870.74s]  have to like actually aim the thing.
[8870.74s -> 8880.74s]  Press Q to make Candyman's mouth
[8880.74s -> 8881.94s]  move. Well I'm using a controller. Was
[8881.94s -> 8882.98s]  it on controller? Are you using
[8882.98s -> 8883.70s]  controller?
[8883.70s -> 8885.94s]  Yeah. Okay just making sure we're on the
[8885.94s -> 8887.54s]  same level here.
[8887.54s -> 8890.23s]  I mean you you could have used like
[8890.23s -> 8891.99s]  the I'm using keyboard and mouse like
[8891.99s -> 8892.87s]  to your advantage you know what I
[8892.87s -> 8893.91s]  mean?
[8893.91s -> 8895.98s]  Whatever. How would you play this game
[8895.98s -> 8897.34s]  reliably with keyboard and mouse?
[8897.34s -> 8900.98s]  I feel like it'd be very hard.
[8900.98s -> 8905.80s]  Just do it. Just do it. Nike just do
[8905.80s -> 8906.84s]  it.
[8906.84s -> 8930.42s]  Oh I gotta use that better. Really?
[8930.42s -> 8939.83s]  Oh oh shit. That's why we're playing the chief ass.
[8939.83s -> 8942.65s]  All right let's see. I gotta be
[8942.73s -> 8947.53s]  ready for that one.
[8947.53s -> 8948.97s]  And you're just going to teleport it
[8948.97s -> 8955.80s]  inside the goal.
[8955.80s -> 8958.36s]  No fuck oh no. Okay I gotta watch your
[8958.36s -> 8959.56s]  special leader.
[8959.56s -> 8983.53s]  Oh I let go of it too early. Damn.
[8983.53s -> 8986.12s]  Hold on. What? I'm trying to figure out
[8986.12s -> 8987.96s]  like what actually makes me
[8987.96s -> 8992.42s]  climb it. Can I do that? No it's his
[8992.42s -> 8994.10s]  thing. I think you think I can climb up
[8994.10s -> 8995.30s]  it but he like falls off and it's
[8995.30s -> 8996.82s]  really weird.
[8996.82s -> 8998.92s]  I don't know maybe I can't stand on
[8998.92s -> 9000.36s]  the scoreboard.
[9000.36s -> 9011.56s]  Okay. I don't know if I can even get it
[9011.56s -> 9012.52s]  from you
[9012.52s -> 9021.70s]  at that point. Maybe not. Oh fuck.
[9021.70s -> 9047.77s]  Fuck. Oh fuck.
[9047.77s -> 9050.57s]  No not this time. I was trying so hard
[9050.57s -> 9057.50s]  to pay attention to it.
[9057.50s -> 9081.61s]  Wow. No this is so stupid now.
[9081.61s -> 9082.89s]  It really is. We're just like doing
[9082.89s -> 9085.69s]  the thing to each other.
[9085.69s -> 9086.97s]  I'll gain meter faster than you'll
[9086.97s -> 9093.02s]  gain meter.
[9097.21s -> 9119.75s]  Oh it's too much. Oh no.
[9119.75s -> 9127.14s]  Almost tied it up. Come on now. Set it
[9127.14s -> 9130.38s]  up for me.
[9130.38s -> 9133.42s]  I did it the wrong way. I did it the wrong way. I did it the wrong way.
[9133.42s -> 9136.70s]  Oh shit I let go of it.
[9136.70s -> 9147.96s]  No. All right let's do it.
[9147.96s -> 9151.16s]  You son of a bitch. I should have
[9151.16s -> 9152.28s]  known you were just
[9152.28s -> 9164.62s]  gaming meter there. Oh you fucking threw me out of the bus.
[9164.62s -> 9173.51s]  Good game. This is all for the curtains? Yeah we gotta tally up every
[9173.51s -> 9174.79s]  single win and loss.
[9174.87s -> 9182.28s]  Well then I obviously win. Let's go with
[9182.28s -> 9184.44s]  who else would be fun in this mode? Are
[9184.44s -> 9186.44s]  we still playing this mode?
[9186.44s -> 9189.22s]  Um what's the other one that we didn't
[9189.22s -> 9193.88s]  do? Did we do all the game modes?
[9193.88s -> 9196.92s]  Maybe go back to original. It's dark in here. I gotta turn the fucking
[9196.92s -> 9203.53s]  lights on. I heard what Switch does but I
[9203.53s -> 9212.65s]  played him a lot before. There we go. Turn on the lights. There
[9212.65s -> 9219.82s]  they are. Hey there they are. All right is
[9219.82s -> 9222.06s]  this what we do? Is this regular mode?
[9222.46s -> 9232.49s]  We're doing regular mode? Oh yeah he can like hit it over
[9232.49s -> 9236.86s]  his head behind him. What was this thing?
[9236.86s -> 9240.62s]  Oh somebody said press Q? Well I'm not gonna do that. I'm in the middle of an
[9240.62s -> 9253.08s]  intense video game right now. I remember that.
[9253.08s -> 9263.46s]  Oh I just my brain just goes to it. I forget what Switch flip is even
[9263.46s -> 9268.14s]  doing. When you do a special what does
[9268.14s -> 9274.20s]  it do? Do you know? I don't know. Hey do you see in the back right at
[9274.20s -> 9276.92s]  the top of the screen in the background?
[9276.92s -> 9280.76s]  I know you can't look right now but TF2 play TF2.
[9280.76s -> 9284.12s]  Is that what it says? That's what it says. I've got the logo. Oh it's the
[9284.12s -> 9294.17s]  oh it's the Team Fortress logo. Is that what that is? Is that
[9294.17s -> 9297.69s]  like an is that an homage? What else would it be? I think you
[9297.69s -> 9300.73s]  may have found a fucking pretty cool homage dude.
[9300.73s -> 9308.79s]  Oh you see that blimp in the background? Please play TF2.
[9308.79s -> 9311.75s]  Tense but that's what the the aliens of the monsters the robots come out
[9311.75s -> 9326.15s]  of the man-averse machine. Oh my lord. Oh my lord I just watched
[9326.15s -> 9332.04s]  myself get hit by fucking four cars in a row.
[9332.04s -> 9339.82s]  Oh man do you see that baseball? Remember the Sandman?
[9339.82s -> 9342.62s]  No you have to make all the references to Fortnite now that's how
[9342.62s -> 9347.58s]  it works. Oh Fortnite? Did you just default Fortnite dance?
[9347.58s -> 9355.83s]  No that's been vetoed. That has been vetoed.
[9355.83s -> 9363.29s]  Good landing. Hey pick stage landing. Tilted towers.
[9363.29s -> 9366.73s]  That was a good initial. You did a good initial there man.
[9366.73s -> 9371.53s]  But was it enough? No I'm too big. I'm too big.
[9371.53s -> 9385.67s]  I would call it a perfect a perfect forward smash. If his super wasn't dumb.
[9385.67s -> 9389.54s]  Are you sure you're like doing it right? Maybe are you sure there's not
[9389.54s -> 9400.41s]  something else you need to do? Sure. Wow. Oh though he does get
[9400.41s -> 9406.89s]  okay I'm kind of understanding. Okay. Wait you can fly?
[9406.89s -> 9415.18s]  You can fly. I can fly. That's really weird. I can fly. I can fly.
[9415.18s -> 9420.46s]  Do you have to tap uh just tap A or anything? Just hold A and I'm flying.
[9420.46s -> 9439.94s]  Oh shit oh shit. Oh I got hit in the same head.
[9440.42s -> 9453.51s]  It's so weird though. Oh I didn't want to taunt.
[9453.51s -> 9480.87s]  Well here it is. Oh that was that was close. Can you parry without full
[9480.87s -> 9483.27s]  meter? Like I was worried about it. I was like wait he doesn't have full. I
[9483.27s -> 9486.47s]  don't know what the rules are here. I know it drains your meter but I
[9486.47s -> 9489.43s]  didn't know if you if you need to have the full one.
[9489.43s -> 9493.85s]  I don't know that's a good question. Um is someone's asking is there an
[9493.85s -> 9497.93s]  option for it to be one hit like the first game? Can you like
[9497.93s -> 9508.28s]  make it one hit and you're out? Or is it only HP? Wait what did you
[9508.28s -> 9511.40s]  ask? I said is there an option to make
[9511.40s -> 9513.80s]  it like the original game? Oh yeah there is.
[9513.88s -> 9518.07s]  Oh you can. Yeah. Would you like it that way?
[9518.07s -> 9542.17s]  Um we can do it after. Oh it's the rocket.
[9542.17s -> 9554.44s]  Ah my brain broke. It's the rocket. And he's gonna build it over there
[9554.44s -> 9570.01s]  aren't you? I don't think I like this man.
[9570.01s -> 9584.76s]  He's just not for me. He seems a little slow.
[9584.76s -> 9593.10s]  Holy fuck. Oh all right. So yeah it goes
[9593.10s -> 9596.14s]  just right to the other person. Yeah but people are telling me
[9596.14s -> 9599.26s]  that you can bump out of it so that you don't always know that it's going to
[9599.26s -> 9615.24s]  come get you and that that helps make them better.
[9615.24s -> 9631.86s]  Oh I was a little confused on exactly what happened there.
[9631.86s -> 9656.10s]  Oh oh good. We haven't seen this one yet. It's two balls.
[9656.10s -> 9659.62s]  It's two fucking balls at the same time.
[9659.62s -> 9670.98s]  Oh I'll see ball. Yeah I don't like he doesn't have a ping pong.
[9670.98s -> 9676.90s]  And I'll uh use HP turned it off. Somebody said there's a dev in the
[9676.90s -> 9681.16s]  chats. Really? Is that is that or are we just
[9681.16s -> 9687.00s]  getting named? Yeah no I made this. Don't you remember like the last couple
[9687.00s -> 9690.28s]  of months where I've been putting like dev updates to you?
[9690.28s -> 9693.82s]  I've been snail mailing them to you. Do you not read them?
[9693.82s -> 9696.94s]  Yeah. No I mean I just kind of put them on
[9696.94s -> 9703.88s]  like the counter. I think I opened one of them. I
[9703.88s -> 9706.36s]  thought it was just bills or something.
[9706.52s -> 9714.78s]  Oh he died. He turned it on. I told you. All right. Wow. Now we get to prove just how
[9714.78s -> 9731.90s]  bad we really are. Now we have to play like gods. Well I
[9731.90s -> 9757.21s]  bunted it and it immediately killed me. Bunt. Oh shit. Oh you bounced it.
[9757.21s -> 9777.38s]  Oh boy you bounced it. Yeah he bounced it man. Oh my lord.
[9777.38s -> 9791.51s]  What? I thought I had it. Oh is there like a delay after you throw?
[9791.51s -> 9806.74s]  Uh it's like a it's like if you do an actual throwing animation.
[9806.82s -> 9814.68s]  Ah damn. Okay I need the dev to confirm that my my character actually says
[9814.68s -> 9824.81s]  says Aiyah and Cho. Is he actually saying Cho or my hearing thing?
[9824.81s -> 9839.58s]  Damn and I tried to grab it out of midair and I was being a little funky.
[9839.58s -> 9843.10s]  What? You just made the eye got hit and died noise.
[9843.10s -> 9850.31s]  No I didn't. You didn't. I'm dead. Definitely saying Aiyah.
[9850.31s -> 9854.81s]  That's all I need to know. Never heard any elderly Chinese player say Cho.
[9854.81s -> 9858.97s]  Uh Cho is like good ball and Cho Lee is good ball again.
[9858.97s -> 9862.73s]  I hear it a lot in competitive like tournaments.
[9862.73s -> 9873.16s]  That's interesting. Like good point. Well game point match point here it
[9873.16s -> 9897.85s]  comes. Ah good game good game good game.
[9897.85s -> 9901.77s]  All right what do you say? What do I do? I like that a lot.
[9901.77s -> 9904.97s]  I just want to make it more points because it's quick.
[9905.29s -> 9910.44s]  Points to 12. Yeah I'm gonna talk about the green screen after
[9910.44s -> 9914.98s]  we play lethal league blaze. The new game.
[9914.98s -> 9919.78s]  New lethal league. It's very fun. I'm going to try
[9919.78s -> 9923.78s]  so hard. How much is this game? What's the price point on this one?
[9923.78s -> 9932.98s]  Uh I don't remember. I thought it was like 20.
[9932.98s -> 9942.18s]  Aye nice. 20 bucks. 20 bucks. We got a fucking endless amount of
[9942.18s -> 9945.30s]  activity here. Holy fuck that was much faster than
[9945.30s -> 9952.14s]  I thought it was. Oh my god I bunted it down just so you
[9952.14s -> 9955.45s]  could kill me.
[9956.79s -> 9969.94s]  Me too. Yeah just like that. Okay try it.
[9969.94s -> 9977.46s]  I'm trying to like legend of Zelda to you.
[9977.46s -> 9984.84s]  Oh my god. I'm trying to do the uh the link down smash.
[9984.84s -> 10010.55s]  What the fuck happened to me? Because I served it at parry.
[10010.55s -> 10014.41s]  I didn't even see you hit it a second time. I did my special.
[10014.49s -> 10019.75s]  Remember my special comes out and then comes back in. Oh
[10019.75s -> 10028.38s]  nice. Excellent work. What? Why? I don't know. I bunted the shit out of
[10028.38s -> 10038.15s]  that. That second was much faster than I
[10038.15s -> 10040.79s]  thought it would be.
[10044.63s -> 10052.81s]  Handcuff man. This guy's font man. Why is everybody saying spy party?
[10052.81s -> 10063.98s]  Spy party. Spy party. Oh my god. You jumped in. I was like he's gonna hit it
[10063.98s -> 10069.21s]  down. Uh like that and okay. Jesus
[10069.21s -> 10080.82s]  Christ. All right. Oh my god. She was like where the random
[10080.82s -> 10084.42s]  random xd. Oh I'm telling it's gamer fatigue. Gamer fatigue? No.
[10084.42s -> 10091.08s]  It's just. It's gamer fatigue man. The throw is weird.
[10091.08s -> 10102.34s]  You gonna let me pogo this? It's not mine. Oh my god. What am I doing over here? I'm
[10102.34s -> 10116.47s]  trying to like steal the ball from you. Oh my god. Are you telling me you really
[10116.47s -> 10119.75s]  aimed those? Because that's just like it feels like it tracks
[10119.75s -> 10127.56s]  exactly wherever I am. I just hook shot at you. It's called the sniper.
[10127.56s -> 10131.24s]  It's never like it's never slightly off. It's always just
[10131.24s -> 10145.19s]  right where it needs to be. Spy party. Spy party. Spy. I don't even
[10145.19s -> 10164.95s]  have a spy party on this computer. I had full meter. I think
[10165.03s -> 10175.94s]  if you parry somebody else you get full meter. I ya indeed.
[10175.94s -> 10198.20s]  This is why this character embodies me. Oh that was.
[10198.20s -> 10218.78s]  Ding. Boop. Oh it really is like a falcon punch. I get it.
[10218.78s -> 10224.04s]  Attention germ reviewers. No I'm not reading that.
[10228.47s -> 10247.18s]  Shit. I'm not reading that. Oh I didn't know you had it.
[10247.18s -> 10251.26s]  Yeah if you hit it like before you get the final one that counts as your
[10251.26s -> 10255.42s]  final hit. So if you run three bars the next hit will be enough to use it.
[10256.14s -> 10263.21s]  Damn I see. Damn he's getting on to me fellas. He's on to me fellas and lads.
[10263.85s -> 10265.93s]  Fellas and ladies. Fellas and lads.
[10278.63s -> 10281.93s]  Oh boy I'm just throwing. I'm throwing it here.
[10282.49s -> 10289.34s]  The bunting in front of people. Not a good idea.
[10291.85s -> 10295.37s]  Whatever that was not a good idea. I don't know it's gamer fatigue.
[10300.60s -> 10305.18s]  It's gamer fatigue man. It's fucking gamer fatigue.
[10306.22s -> 10315.59s]  Gamer fatigue. Gamer fatigue. Not just really fast.
[10315.59s -> 10317.59s]  Sometimes it throws surprise.
[10326.38s -> 10330.14s]  Oh what the hell was that? That was like a super ball.
[10330.14s -> 10338.89s]  Fucking I was trying to time it.
[10338.89s -> 10351.99s]  You just need one point.
[10363.11s -> 10365.19s]  I thought you were going to throw it. I thought you were going to do the thing
[10365.19s -> 10369.19s]  where you just try to blanket on me very quickly. I'm going to try to throw it back at you.
[10369.19s -> 10371.03s]  Is there actually the one character we hadn't seen?
[10372.84s -> 10373.88s]  Have we? I don't have.
[10375.16s -> 10376.28s]  There's one other guy right?
[10377.32s -> 10379.24s]  Is there? I mean there's this dude.
[10379.24s -> 10380.12s]  Oh oh yeah.
[10383.56s -> 10384.36s]  Let's try somebody else.
[10386.46s -> 10389.64s]  I'm gonna play baseball guy. What's his special? What is baseball man special?
[10391.00s -> 10394.44s]  I don't know. He spins and hits and then it does nothing.
[10396.49s -> 10397.05s]  Sounds fun.
[10397.69s -> 10401.59s]  I can't remember. I used to play him a lot.
[10401.59s -> 10403.75s]  So I remember being good but I didn't. I don't.
[10403.75s -> 10405.83s]  Yeah I think it just goes faster.
[10409.88s -> 10425.14s]  Jesus fuck man. I didn't know you were going to activate it.
[10436.42s -> 10441.30s]  My god that was the most embarrassing round.
[10442.66s -> 10444.18s]  Even worse than the volleyball earlier.
[10445.94s -> 10447.75s]  It's gamer fatigue.
[10451.82s -> 10452.78s]  I thought it was gonna.
[10454.70s -> 10455.98s]  I thought it was gonna get you.
[10457.18s -> 10459.82s]  That would have been ultra ultra gamer embarrassment.
[10466.63s -> 10467.11s]  Jesus.
[10473.85s -> 10475.05s]  Oh I jumped into it.
[10476.28s -> 10477.64s]  It was weird that you like hit it up.
[10482.94s -> 10484.06s]  What the fuck am I doing here?
[10493.59s -> 10495.75s]  Wow that was quick.
[10495.75s -> 10506.36s]  Yeah oh man.
[10507.16s -> 10507.96s]  I just threw you.
[10508.60s -> 10509.40s]  Yeah I didn't turn around.
[10509.40s -> 10510.44s]  I just threw you over there.
[10526.86s -> 10527.36s]  Nice.
[10534.18s -> 10538.25s]  Whoa I think you can just go any direction and it goes faster.
[10538.97s -> 10543.19s]  Yeah god damn it what the fuck am I thinking?
[10543.19s -> 10545.27s]  I just keep trying to go over that bonehead play.
[10545.99s -> 10566.62s]  Is Jermey even trying anymore?
[10566.62s -> 10567.12s]  Yeah.
[10571.32s -> 10572.68s]  Oh Jesus.
[10585.66s -> 10586.16s]  Damn.
[10597.88s -> 10599.24s]  You got that twice in a row didn't you?
[10606.07s -> 10607.11s]  I'm surprised I didn't get that.
[10607.75s -> 10609.03s]  Kind of right where I was swinging.
[10609.91s -> 10618.65s]  I was waiting for it.
[10619.13s -> 10622.74s]  Oh my god.
[10625.99s -> 10626.49s]  Didn't work.
[10639.24s -> 10640.60s]  Nice fucking play.
[10640.60s -> 10641.88s]  I was I knew it.
[10643.45s -> 10646.02s]  I should have just backed off.
[10646.02s -> 10654.02s]  Dinked him.
[10654.02s -> 10669.69s]  I'm trying to grab it in midair.
[10669.69s -> 10670.19s]  Nice.
[10670.73s -> 10676.42s]  Grabbing from a parry is more difficult than it seems.
[10677.78s -> 10678.42s]  Yeah?
[10678.42s -> 10678.92s]  Yeah.
[10680.30s -> 10682.14s]  Recuperate from gamer fatigue.
[10683.10s -> 10685.98s]  Recuperating from gamer fatigue is more difficult than it seems.
[10687.59s -> 10690.44s]  Come back to you.
[10691.08s -> 10693.05s]  Controller unplugged.
[10697.62s -> 10698.66s]  You can bait parries?
[10698.66s -> 10699.16s]  Yeah.
[10700.34s -> 10701.94s]  Yeah this is a lot trickery.
[10701.94s -> 10704.58s]  Do you remember what this girl's thing was?
[10704.58s -> 10705.46s]  You used her a second ago.
[10706.10s -> 10707.70s]  I don't even remember.
[10707.70s -> 10709.38s]  I don't think I even got a chance to use her special.
[10709.38s -> 10709.94s]  I was so bad.
[10710.90s -> 10715.70s]  Do you know that you can bunt out of your special?
[10716.81s -> 10718.49s]  Does it consume the special?
[10718.49s -> 10718.99s]  Yeah.
[10719.93s -> 10721.29s]  So while you're in the mid you can just bunt.
[10722.01s -> 10723.13s]  Interesting.
[10736.22s -> 10745.82s]  Damn it.
[10745.82s -> 10747.42s]  What the fuck is going on?
[10747.42s -> 10748.06s]  What happened here?
[10749.08s -> 10750.20s]  What? Are you still here?
[10750.20s -> 10750.70s]  Yeah.
[10750.70s -> 10751.24s]  What the fuck?
[10751.24s -> 10752.92s]  Is that your is that your move?
[10752.92s -> 10753.72s]  Her move changed.
[10753.72s -> 10756.28s]  I remember it changes the direction a couple times.
[10756.28s -> 10759.00s]  No no I mean like there's like a dummy here of you.
[10759.00s -> 10760.04s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[10761.19s -> 10761.69s]  Oh well.
[10762.65s -> 10765.21s]  I thought you put a dummy here.
[10765.21s -> 10765.71s]  No.
[10766.33s -> 10767.05s]  Oh well.
[10767.05s -> 10767.55s]  Oh well.
[10773.63s -> 10774.67s]  Oh that's what it is.
[10778.03s -> 10779.15s]  Okay now you're off the screen.
[10779.87s -> 10793.29s]  That was a that was just a bad program.
[10794.09s -> 10796.49s]  It really doesn't feel like it didn't.
[10803.52s -> 10806.56s]  One of you hundred devs needs to fit a hundred devs.
[10806.56s -> 10808.40s]  Yeah can you believe they have a hundred dev team?
[10816.25s -> 10816.81s]  Damn it.
[10816.81s -> 10818.33s]  I'm so panicking over that shit.
[10818.97s -> 10832.67s]  Shit I'm holding it down now.
[10841.72s -> 10843.96s]  Oh lord I'm slowing down.
[10844.04s -> 10845.08s]  Yeah I'm slowing down.
[10854.92s -> 10857.64s]  Oh my god I thought I was you because we're both beautiful women.
[10875.61s -> 10877.29s]  I programmed the cars in the background.
[10877.29s -> 10878.01s]  Nice job man.
[10896.24s -> 10898.80s]  Stages like this I don't know there's some of the stages that
[10898.80s -> 10900.16s]  the wiggling back and forth is.
[10901.28s -> 10903.28s]  I can't I can't I can't man.
[10904.48s -> 10905.68s]  I don't like the stage wiggling.
[10908.41s -> 10909.93s]  Damn well you still just saved my life.
[10912.25s -> 10913.37s]  Oh cheese bag cheese bag.
[10921.53s -> 10922.03s]  Jesus.
[10932.40s -> 10933.44s]  I just want to get a hand on it.
[10934.08s -> 10935.60s]  I just want to touch it.
[10946.06s -> 10949.02s]  Oh shit I thought it was gonna go the other way.
[10949.02s -> 10973.95s]  Down instead of up.
[10973.95s -> 10974.91s]  Oh my god.
[10974.91s -> 10977.44s]  Sometimes you gotta I gotta just stop moving.
[10978.52s -> 10979.16s]  Just slow down.
[10979.16s -> 10980.60s]  It's like you know what people are like I don't.
[10980.60s -> 10981.40s]  Never mind just.
[10984.92s -> 10986.20s]  You might want to move a little bit.
[11002.60s -> 11003.32s]  Sonic boom.
[11007.16s -> 11007.56s]  Shit.
[11007.56s -> 11008.36s]  You fooled me.
[11008.36s -> 11009.16s]  You fooled me.
[11009.16s -> 11009.66s]  Fooled him.
[11014.54s -> 11015.18s]  You fooled me.
[11016.56s -> 11017.28s]  Level 23.
[11027.07s -> 11027.71s]  You fooled me.
[11030.20s -> 11030.76s]  Knock out.
[11030.76s -> 11032.60s]  Piece of cake.
[11041.37s -> 11042.33s]  What is wrong with you?
[11043.21s -> 11045.53s]  That's the that's the punch out.
[11045.53s -> 11050.56s]  It's only one good character.
[11051.20s -> 11052.00s]  Ping pong guy.
[11059.71s -> 11062.19s]  That's that was that was the when you beat somebody in punch out.
[11063.23s -> 11063.71s]  Look it up.
[11065.23s -> 11066.51s]  You beat someone in punch out.
[11082.81s -> 11085.37s]  Oh come on really you how did you get rid of that one.
[11086.86s -> 11088.54s]  You were you were doing it.
[11089.42s -> 11090.78s]  That didn't sound anything like it.
[11090.78s -> 11091.66s]  I'll play it in a second.
[11092.30s -> 11094.38s]  What the hell why was it floating to me.
[11094.38s -> 11095.74s]  It floated to me.
[11095.74s -> 11097.18s]  Because after a second it floats to you.
[11098.06s -> 11100.80s]  Come on bro.
[11100.80s -> 11109.05s]  What's happening with my body.
[11109.05s -> 11109.61s]  I think it was.
[11109.61s -> 11110.65s]  Oh I was in the middle of a special.
[11110.65s -> 11112.73s]  Yeah you were in the special so you still had a lock on it.
[11113.88s -> 11114.20s]  All right.
[11115.08s -> 11119.28s]  You're just like binding of Isaac me.
[11119.28s -> 11122.48s]  With the fucking item that's like aerial of you know what I'm saying.
[11122.48s -> 11124.24s]  No I have no idea what you're saying actually.
[11125.36s -> 11127.68s]  You walked into me with like band-aid girl.
[11127.68s -> 11128.18s]  Oh.
[11129.20s -> 11132.41s]  See that's like what.
[11132.41s -> 11133.53s]  What the fuck man.
[11136.97s -> 11138.88s]  I'm gonna stop doing that to you.
[11139.68s -> 11142.92s]  Try it.
[11142.92s -> 11148.68s]  It's pretty rough.
[11150.96s -> 11151.76s]  No that sucks.
[11152.88s -> 11159.07s]  Oh here I come.
[11159.95s -> 11160.19s]  Yeah.
[11160.19s -> 11161.23s]  Orbitable damage.
[11161.23s -> 11162.11s]  Orbital damage.
[11162.11s -> 11162.59s]  Orbitable.
[11173.52s -> 11175.87s]  When does the binding of Isaac come.
[11176.51s -> 11178.35s]  Expansion coming up soon right.
[11179.23s -> 11181.15s]  When does Diablo immortal come out.
[11181.87s -> 11183.04s]  I can't wait.
[11184.08s -> 11184.92s]  Who knows.
[11185.80s -> 11189.82s]  When does 2B come out.
[11190.46s -> 11192.27s]  2B?
[11192.27s -> 11193.63s]  2B in Soul Calibur.
[11194.35s -> 11200.75s]  Wait we're playing this really really just boring aren't we.
[11205.44s -> 11206.72s]  I walk ball into you.
[11206.72s -> 11208.32s]  I would probably get you a ball.
[11209.28s -> 11212.09s]  Hey I'm playing a win.
[11213.28s -> 11214.96s]  Oh my god that fucking throw.
[11215.68s -> 11221.04s]  2B or not wait 2B from near Autonomica.
[11221.04s -> 11225.28s]  Yeah near Autonomica is gonna fight Geralt of Skyrim.
[11225.28s -> 11227.40s]  Wait Geralt is in Soul Calibur.
[11227.40s -> 11227.90s]  Yeah.
[11228.44s -> 11229.16s]  Is he really.
[11229.16s -> 11229.66s]  Yeah.
[11230.60s -> 11232.44s]  No be honest with me here.
[11232.44s -> 11233.00s]  He is yeah.
[11234.04s -> 11234.94s]  That's pretty cool.
[11235.74s -> 11253.82s]  Wrong direction.
[11253.82s -> 11254.22s]  You'll see.
[11267.16s -> 11268.04s]  No I can't add it.
[11272.06s -> 11273.90s]  Oh my that is so deceiving.
[11274.94s -> 11277.50s]  Why is the second throw like 10 times faster.
[11278.52s -> 11279.08s]  It just is.
[11280.94s -> 11282.86s]  That was the cheesiest shittiest game ever.
[11283.90s -> 11286.54s]  That's why you have to regulate it and play volleyball.
[11288.81s -> 11291.61s]  All right well how about let's do one more volleyball.
[11292.41s -> 11295.55s]  And then I need to talk to my stream about green screen stuff.

[12922.17s -> 12925.45s]  I could tell her I was like doing push-ups in here for like fucking three out four hours.
[12925.45s -> 12928.25s]  And she'd be like oh wow wow you really look like you've been working out.
[12928.81s -> 12930.48s]  Don't even need to go to the fucking gym.
[12931.36s -> 12933.60s]  But anyways let's get this back off.
[12935.32s -> 12937.16s]  And let me transition.
[12937.16s -> 12938.76s]  Well actually I don't think I can just keep this on.
[12939.56s -> 12941.13s]  So let's talk about the green screen.
[12941.77s -> 12946.84s]  Those of you that don't know just like I'm just going to be this cube in the middle.
[12947.72s -> 12948.36s]  Yeah that's fine.
[12948.92s -> 12950.96s]  I don't want to use too much internet.
[12951.93s -> 12956.09s]  So for those of you that don't know there is a thank you for sharing.
[12956.09s -> 12956.81s]  You're very welcome.
[12957.53s -> 12962.97s]  So next week I'm going to do a stream where I get in front of a green screen.
[12963.61s -> 12969.77s]  And I'm going to do potentially 150 to 200 separate actions.
[12970.41s -> 12975.85s]  So originally the plan was I was going to have a voting period.
[12975.85s -> 12978.89s]  And it was going to be secret where I didn't know what you guys were suggesting.
[12979.69s -> 12984.73s]  But I've changed the rules a little bit because it's just not going to happen.
[12984.73s -> 12989.85s]  There were like I think 1500 plus different suggestions in that channel in the discord.
[12989.85s -> 12994.49s]  So it was like there was no way I was reliably going to just be like oh hey mods.
[12994.49s -> 12997.77s]  Hey can you do like fucking if there's props involved I need to know what they are so I
[12997.77s -> 12998.49s]  can buy them.
[12998.49s -> 12998.89s]  You know what I mean?
[12998.89s -> 13002.89s]  I need to know what these things are so if I need to know what they are so I can buy them.
[13002.89s -> 13003.29s]  You know what I mean?
[13003.29s -> 13006.25s]  I need to know what these things are so I'm able to do them.
[13007.21s -> 13012.41s]  So what I did is I went through myself and I did a pre-screening.
[13012.41s -> 13016.17s]  Essentially I went through every single every single submission in that channel.
[13016.89s -> 13019.93s]  And it was oh we're going to make a poll.
[13019.93s -> 13021.29s]  We're going to make a voting.
[13021.29s -> 13023.53s]  There's not going to be any voting for all the actions.
[13023.53s -> 13024.81s]  I'm just going to take the ones that I like.
[13025.45s -> 13026.97s]  The audio is out of sync.
[13026.97s -> 13028.49s]  Oh it's because of PlayStation 4.
[13029.29s -> 13030.09s]  Here let me do this.
[13031.79s -> 13033.55s]  It is because of the PS4.
[13042.86s -> 13063.23s]  The mic has been out of sync the entire stream hasn't it?
[13063.23s -> 13063.95s]  It had to have been.
[13067.90s -> 13070.62s]  Yeah no there's no way that it wasn't out of sync the whole stream.
[13073.28s -> 13084.03s]  Was I like responding to things Star was saying like two full seconds before he said them?
[13084.03s -> 13085.31s]  So wait hold on a second.
[13085.31s -> 13087.31s]  I've been I've been like a full second behind.
[13090.06s -> 13090.70s]  It was fine.
[13092.59s -> 13095.69s]  All right it seemed fine.
[13095.69s -> 13100.17s]  All right well that my microphone was 650 milliseconds behind.
[13100.89s -> 13103.61s]  So he would say something and it would take me almost a full second to respond to it.
[13103.61s -> 13108.56s]  But as long as it uh as long as it wasn't that noticeable.
[13108.56s -> 13111.28s]  It was just stuck there from the PlayStation 4 when when it did Red Dead.
[13115.39s -> 13116.51s]  It still seems off.
[13117.07s -> 13117.87s]  It should not be.
[13120.32s -> 13122.56s]  Yeah I'm at zero here and the camera's at zero.
[13125.69s -> 13126.01s]  Is it?
[13126.65s -> 13129.72s]  Yeah it's fine.
[13129.72s -> 13136.57s]  But anyways uh the let's go well hopefully that wasn't fucking horrible to watch.
[13138.25s -> 13139.93s]  Uh sorry about that.
[13139.93s -> 13142.25s]  I you know it's been kind of crazy here with the internet.
[13142.81s -> 13146.25s]  So I saw green and stepped on the fucking gas.
[13146.25s -> 13147.13s]  Didn't even think about it.
[13147.13s -> 13148.49s]  It was just like green internet screen go.
[13149.37s -> 13151.12s]  So sorry about that.
[13151.12s -> 13155.24s]  Anyways uh talk about the green screen right.
[13155.24s -> 13161.61s]  So instead of having it be a period where everybody votes and I don't know in secret.
[13161.61s -> 13164.97s]  I just I went through and I picked out the ones that I think I want to do.
[13164.97s -> 13169.21s]  And I narrowed it down to about 120, 130 plus actions.
[13170.17s -> 13171.21s]  There's going to be one poll.
[13171.93s -> 13177.53s]  So the poll is going to be what meme shit you guys want me to do.
[13177.53s -> 13179.45s]  Because there was just a lot of meme shit.
[13179.45s -> 13182.25s]  And I don't even want I don't even want to talk about them.
[13182.25s -> 13186.78s]  So there's going to be a poll with all the memes on it.
[13186.78s -> 13188.22s]  I've already vetoed three of them.
[13188.22s -> 13190.78s]  So you'll you'll get to see it over the next day here.
[13192.32s -> 13195.28s]  So I'm going to put a poll in the discord.
[13195.28s -> 13196.40s]  I'll give it to one of the mods.
[13196.40s -> 13197.28s]  I'll put it in the general.
[13197.28s -> 13198.24s]  That's where it's going to be.
[13198.24s -> 13199.92s]  I haven't made it yet so that's why it's not here.
[13200.96s -> 13203.36s]  And there's no more suggestions as of tonight.
[13204.08s -> 13208.64s]  So pretty much by the time this stream is over five or six hours later.
[13208.64s -> 13209.76s]  I'll probably till like midnight.
[13210.88s -> 13214.40s]  Pacific which would be 3am eastern is when it's going to be just completely closed.
[13215.44s -> 13219.28s]  I'm going to then a couple days later figure out exactly how I want to do it.
[13219.28s -> 13220.32s]  What I want to do.
[13220.32s -> 13223.12s]  And then you guys are going to be a poll that's going to be up for like three or
[13223.12s -> 13224.64s]  four days before the stream happens.
[13225.20s -> 13229.84s]  From what mean is three meme shit that I get to do out of like 20 different options.
[13230.40s -> 13232.24s]  So we'll go we'll touch on that later.
[13233.28s -> 13237.37s]  Police temple you chose where there are a lot of great ones.
[13238.33s -> 13242.73s]  There are a lot of odd ones too but you'll see soon enough.
[13243.92s -> 13248.48s]  And because I got a little bit of time here to be able to actually explain all this.
[13249.80s -> 13252.20s]  After the poll is closed and after it's ready to go.
[13253.32s -> 13256.52s]  It's going to be the after the stream happens.
[13256.52s -> 13260.44s]  There's going to be like full two full weeks before we even do anything else.
[13260.44s -> 13265.08s]  So you'll have plenty of fucking time to be able to put together whatever you want.
[13265.08s -> 13267.08s]  And the rules for that.
[13267.08s -> 13269.08s]  I think I won't even talk about them till later.
[13270.04s -> 13271.80s]  What's my personal favorite one.
[13272.92s -> 13275.40s]  There's two of my I'll tell you that my two personal favorites.
[13275.40s -> 13278.04s]  Because I just can't even imagine how stupid that it's going to be.
[13279.00s -> 13280.36s]  Personal favorite number one is.
[13281.48s -> 13285.16s]  Go limp on the ground hear something and pretend to be a toy from Toy Story.
[13285.72s -> 13288.52s]  Like that's like what that's fucking ridiculous.
[13289.32s -> 13292.20s]  Go hear something and go limp.
[13293.00s -> 13295.08s]  Like I don't even know where you're going to put me there.
[13295.08s -> 13296.12s]  And the second one is.
[13297.72s -> 13301.88s]  Be in a bowl of cereal and avoid a toddler eating cereal from the bowl.
[13305.60s -> 13308.16s]  Like what how am I supposed to even do that.
[13311.18s -> 13314.30s]  There's hundreds of guys like you think that that's it.
[13314.86s -> 13316.38s]  And people were concerned though.
[13316.38s -> 13318.86s]  I mean let me let me squelch these concerns right away.
[13318.86s -> 13322.54s]  A ton of people are like oh man we're just going to get like a bunch of fucked up shit.
[13322.54s -> 13324.86s]  Not going to be able to use oh no no I'm.
[13325.42s -> 13327.42s]  We're doing a full spread here man.
[13327.42s -> 13329.02s]  I am doing like standing.
[13329.82s -> 13336.06s]  Blinking walking running dodging getting hit getting hit in the shoulder getting hit in the arm.
[13336.06s -> 13340.06s]  Getting hit in the shin getting hit in the face like this is going to be a full nine.
[13340.70s -> 13346.30s]  It's not going to be like oh I'm just going to like eat fucking bananas on stream.
[13346.30s -> 13347.98s]  And then that's it.
[13347.98s -> 13349.66s]  There you go meemers like no.
[13351.18s -> 13352.14s]  We're doing the whole thing.
[13353.53s -> 13358.97s]  Like oh react scared react scared plus react scared plus plus you know what I mean.
[13358.97s -> 13360.57s]  Like there's going to be plenty of options for you.
[13361.93s -> 13365.21s]  And there's a ton of random fucking things that people have suggested that are going to be funny too.
[13367.98s -> 13370.70s]  Sprites essentially I'm making human sprites that's right.
[13372.28s -> 13375.80s]  And then a couple weeks later we're going to do it might even take two streams in a row.
[13375.80s -> 13378.68s]  To do a night where we sit around and we just hang out and we just play them.
[13379.24s -> 13381.64s]  And they will be rules by the way based on that.
[13381.64s -> 13385.72s]  I'm going to assume it's going to be this is not set in stone so it's not quite ready yet.
[13385.72s -> 13390.20s]  But up to two minutes and at least 10 seconds.
[13391.56s -> 13395.08s]  That has to be there because like I said I was talking to the discord the other day.
[13395.64s -> 13400.60s]  I ain't going to have like 400 submissions that are just like up.
[13400.60s -> 13404.92s]  Like no that's not like it's got to be at least 10 seconds or up to two minutes.
[13404.92s -> 13405.40s]  You know what I mean.
[13406.20s -> 13410.48s]  Those actions are funny but do we have anything to really add the green screen.
[13410.48s -> 13413.76s]  Oh there's a lot of things that are going to be worthy of the green screen.
[13414.72s -> 13417.53s]  There's at least 60 of these actions.
[13417.53s -> 13419.45s]  They're very very going to they're going to be very fun.
[13422.60s -> 13423.80s]  When was the sideburn patch.
[13423.80s -> 13424.44s]  I fixed them.
[13424.44s -> 13426.84s]  Look see right there.
[13428.35s -> 13430.27s]  Right there even I fixed it.
[13431.36s -> 13435.10s]  See I fixed it.
[13435.10s -> 13436.22s]  I told you guys I was going to fix it.
[13436.94s -> 13442.33s]  Can you do 10 bups?
[13443.50s -> 13449.98s]  Sure it could be like but I mean is it going to pass the pre-screening.
[13449.98s -> 13451.34s]  Because all these members.
[13451.34s -> 13453.66s]  Here's something another thing that a lot of people might not understand.
[13454.30s -> 13459.66s]  There's going to be a rigorous pre-screening on every single one of these submissions.
[13459.66s -> 13463.42s]  And you only get to submit I would probably assume we're going to have a limit here.
[13463.42s -> 13467.34s]  You can only submit like two or three submissions because people will just
[13467.34s -> 13471.66s]  diarrhea in like a hundred fucking submissions of random shit.
[13471.66s -> 13475.66s]  So we're going to have very strict rules and if they don't follow the rules
[13475.74s -> 13480.76s]  Strictly strictly they're going to just get thrown out.
[13480.76s -> 13486.17s]  Because I cannot have a scenario where it's like do you know.
[13488.54s -> 13490.86s]  What oh guy stands in front of green screen.
[13490.86s -> 13493.90s]  You know how fucking easy it would be to do up all kinds of fucked up shit.
[13494.46s -> 13497.66s]  No they're all getting pre-watched pre-screened not by me.
[13497.66s -> 13499.18s]  I mean maybe I will do it.
[13499.18s -> 13500.62s]  It depends on how much there are.
[13502.17s -> 13505.66s]  So there's going to be laws here in this lawless country.
[13506.30s -> 13507.10s]  There's going to be laws.
[13510.48s -> 13512.32s]  Should we put a cap on the amount of videos total.
[13513.12s -> 13517.77s]  Um I don't I'm not sure because it really depends on how many submissions there are.
[13518.89s -> 13524.49s]  Because if there are like let's say 50 to 100 really great submissions
[13525.21s -> 13526.65s]  and they're up to two minutes long.
[13527.37s -> 13528.89s]  I mean that's not very long.
[13528.89s -> 13529.45s]  You know what I mean.
[13529.45s -> 13532.33s]  Like that wouldn't take a long time and plus if we do an entire stream
[13532.89s -> 13539.05s]  a full three four plus hour live stream maybe two streams maybe possibly.
[13539.77s -> 13542.33s]  Then they would have to be hundreds of submissions that get through.
[13542.97s -> 13544.57s]  If you take back to the emote contest.
[13545.53s -> 13550.17s]  I mean the emote contest had a ton of submissions and a ton of ones got pre-screened.
[13550.17s -> 13552.33s]  But it wasn't like an outrageous level.
[13552.89s -> 13554.89s]  I mean there's 3,000 people here now.
[13554.89s -> 13559.45s]  But I don't think this channel is quite at a spot where it's unmanageable.
[13559.45s -> 13560.01s]  You know what I mean.
[13561.13s -> 13564.01s]  Up to like three four five hundred submissions then going through them
[13564.01s -> 13565.53s]  and bringing them down to like a hundred or two hundred.
[13566.33s -> 13569.29s]  I mean if there were like two thousand submissions then this would be impossible.
[13569.29s -> 13569.53s]  Right.
[13570.97s -> 13571.77s]  What is this contest?
[13572.17s -> 13572.81s]  It's not a contest.
[13572.81s -> 13574.25s]  This is not a contest at all.
[13574.89s -> 13578.89s]  This is just a fun thing that we can do just to make some weird shit.
[13579.69s -> 13581.37s]  And see what you guys can come up with.
[13581.37s -> 13585.45s]  Because I also I was talking to Star about this earlier.
[13586.09s -> 13590.65s]  It's going to be kind of fun to essentially bring in some people to do them.
[13590.65s -> 13591.21s]  Right.
[13591.21s -> 13594.17s]  Like I'll have I'll see if Star wants to do an edit.
[13594.17s -> 13594.97s]  He's already talked about it.
[13594.97s -> 13596.65s]  Like italics might want to do an edit.
[13596.65s -> 13599.85s]  Bring in some more people to like do edits and like show theirs on screen.
[13599.85s -> 13600.33s]  You know what I mean.
[13600.89s -> 13602.49s]  Hit up some people see if they'd want to do it.
[13603.29s -> 13607.55s]  Am I going to be doing a fortnight?
[13607.55s -> 13608.51s]  No that was already vetoed.
[13611.02s -> 13613.58s]  So see like if I just see if anybody was interested in doing it.
[13616.00s -> 13620.28s]  But is that a dong on the door?
[13620.28s -> 13621.92s]  That's a fucking creeper man.
[13621.92s -> 13622.16s]  Come on.
[13622.16s -> 13623.12s]  You guys have played that game.
[13623.84s -> 13627.48s]  How am I going to veto the default dance?
[13627.48s -> 13629.64s]  Because I get three vetoes and I don't want to do it.
[13630.20s -> 13633.08s]  And it's it's actually kind of funny because I didn't do the veto thing.
[13633.08s -> 13634.36s]  It's just there kind of for fun.
[13635.00s -> 13638.28s]  Because I vetoed a lot of fucking things that came through there.
[13638.28s -> 13641.16s]  I vetoed almost 90% of every submission.
[13641.16s -> 13643.77s]  So that's a creeper.
[13650.67s -> 13652.32s]  But it should be fun.
[13652.32s -> 13653.44s]  There'll be way more.
[13653.44s -> 13654.88s]  What's with the shitty wallpaper?
[13658.91s -> 13661.71s]  It's it's just like regular wall man.
[13664.41s -> 13664.97s]  Shitty wall.
[13664.97s -> 13667.21s]  There's no there's no wallpaper on this wall.
[13669.28s -> 13669.92s]  Wallpaper.
[13672.48s -> 13674.00s]  Three vetoes is bullshit.
[13677.87s -> 13684.96s]  Three hold on three vetoes based on like 1500 submissions.
[13685.77s -> 13688.81s]  And I pre-screened them down to like 200.
[13688.81s -> 13690.65s]  Three vetoes out of 200.
[13691.29s -> 13693.21s]  You're lucky I don't veto 50 of them.
[13693.77s -> 13697.76s]  Let's see what's what do you mean the drink?
[13697.76s -> 13698.96s]  This drink right here.
[13698.96s -> 13703.37s]  Will I pretend to be a rat?
[13703.37s -> 13705.61s]  It depends on if I want to put it in there or not.
[13706.17s -> 13708.89s]  I got a whole list and it's pretty much ready to go.
[13708.89s -> 13711.45s]  After tonight I'm going to do one more pass through tonight.
[13711.45s -> 13714.73s]  And see if there's any new ones or any good ideas and we'll go from there.
[13715.45s -> 13716.49s]  But this is but what's today?
[13716.49s -> 13721.53s]  Today is today's Sunday.
[13722.43s -> 13725.87s]  So I would assume based around the fact that closing it tonight.
[13727.45s -> 13731.45s]  Maybe gonna give myself like three days or so to like.
[13731.45s -> 13733.29s]  Well remember I have to buy props on Amazon.
[13733.29s -> 13734.33s]  So at least two days.
[13734.97s -> 13737.44s]  I would I would probably say that by this weekend.
[13737.44s -> 13739.36s]  Like this next like weekend coming up here.
[13739.36s -> 13741.68s]  We'll do it on like probably Saturday or Sunday afternoon.
[13742.32s -> 13743.52s]  Is what I'm going to shoot for.
[13744.73s -> 13748.57s]  And after that two weeks later there'll be all the footage will be available.
[13748.57s -> 13750.41s]  Whether you want to pull it from Twitch directly or.
[13751.05s -> 13753.45s]  It's going to be difficult for me to put it all up raw.
[13754.49s -> 13756.41s]  I'll have to find out if I can do that.
[13757.13s -> 13757.61s]  We'll see.
[13758.17s -> 13759.77s]  But expect it at some point this weekend.
[13760.41s -> 13764.48s]  Is this still a one dance limit?
[13765.12s -> 13767.82s]  There weren't no not very many people did dances.
[13767.82s -> 13769.74s]  Not very many people were putting up dances.
[13769.74s -> 13772.46s]  They were doing the people would to give you guys a lot of credit here.
[13772.46s -> 13777.18s]  You guys were trying to at least put some interesting shit up there.
[13777.18s -> 13779.26s]  It wasn't just like total nonsense.
[13779.26s -> 13780.30s]  You guys did a pretty good job.
[13781.10s -> 13784.60s]  I'm not going to use more than three vetoes.
[13784.60s -> 13785.08s]  I already have.
[13785.08s -> 13785.56s]  I've already done it.
[13786.52s -> 13788.76s]  You want to tell you what the three vetoes are.
[13789.24s -> 13794.76s]  Fortnite dance dab and reenact the gnome video.
[13794.76s -> 13796.20s]  That's an automatic veto.
[13796.84s -> 13799.92s]  I ain't doing any of those three things.
[13800.40s -> 13807.85s]  Reenact the gnome video was suggested like six thousand times.
[13808.57s -> 13810.65s]  Then it was upvoted like a thousand times.
[13810.65s -> 13811.45s]  That's a veto.
[13814.59s -> 13818.32s]  Well let me just give you a little bit of a consolation here.
[13818.56s -> 13821.60s]  Oh no the gnome is not selectable in the meme poll.
[13821.60s -> 13825.68s]  But run as Sonic and say Sonic's the name speeds my game.
[13826.48s -> 13828.48s]  That's not fucking embarrassing as hell.
[13829.20s -> 13829.92s]  That's an option.
[13830.64s -> 13832.96s]  Are you kidding me?
[13835.82s -> 13837.18s]  You could be known as the gnome.
[13837.18s -> 13838.86s]  I don't want to be known as the gnome guy.
[13839.74s -> 13842.86s]  I don't want to be known as the guy that's like the annoying dude that
[13842.86s -> 13845.98s]  I'm the new gnome video that people start to put into the other gnome videos.
[13845.98s -> 13846.94s]  I don't want to be that guy.
[13847.74s -> 13849.90s]  I'll be the guy that people will hate me for that.
[13849.90s -> 13851.26s]  People will be very upset.
[13851.26s -> 13854.78s]  Streamers, YouTubers, friends of yours.
[13854.78s -> 13857.34s]  People like random people on like Overwatch lobbies.
[13857.34s -> 13859.18s]  People are going to be like that guy sucks.
[13859.18s -> 13860.22s]  Why did he make this?
[13860.22s -> 13861.66s]  He made that.
[13861.66s -> 13862.38s]  I didn't make it.
[13862.38s -> 13863.50s]  I don't want to make it veto.
[13866.96s -> 13868.00s]  Vetoed man.
[13868.00s -> 13868.48s]  No way.
[13869.20s -> 13876.16s]  But anyways it's going to be a lot of fun.
[13876.16s -> 13876.96s]  I'm looking forward to it.
[13877.68s -> 13878.72s]  All the props that are there.
[13879.68s -> 13883.76s]  I mean it's going to be hard but I'll try to do a full figure skating skit.
[13883.76s -> 13886.08s]  That's going to be fucking hard but it's going to be funny.
[13886.08s -> 13888.40s]  I'm going to put like fucking fake blades on my shoes.
[13889.58s -> 13891.18s]  There's so many fun things.
[13891.18s -> 13892.30s]  I don't think you guys understand.
[13897.28s -> 13899.68s]  There's a lot of interesting potential things here.
[13900.40s -> 13903.76s]  Could you say something for a senior quote of mine?
[13914.56s -> 13918.27s]  Falling down hard through the ground.
[13919.95s -> 13923.45s]  Eventually you end up standing up because you go through the earth
[13924.25s -> 13926.36s]  and you're on top of the world in China.
[13927.00s -> 13929.56s]  So move to China.
[13930.20s -> 13945.42s]  But you just moved to Vegas.
[13945.42s -> 13947.34s]  Yeah well I'm moving to China now.
[13947.34s -> 13948.70s]  I'm going to China now.
[13949.34s -> 13950.84s]  Take a new balloon.
[13953.26s -> 13954.46s]  Is the sip part of the quote?
[13954.46s -> 13954.70s]  No.
[13955.34s -> 13962.96s]  Help me come up with a wedding toast.
[13962.96s -> 13963.20s]  Okay.
[13964.00s -> 13965.96s]  Hey everybody.
[13966.60s -> 13967.24s]  Good to see you.
[13967.96s -> 13969.80s]  For those of you on this side that don't know me.
[13970.36s -> 13970.92s]  I'm Greg.
[13972.73s -> 13974.33s]  Little bro over here you know.
[13974.33s -> 13975.13s]  I'm the little bro.
[13976.57s -> 13977.37s]  I've seen some of you guys.
[13977.37s -> 13978.17s]  I've met some of you guys.
[13978.89s -> 13980.89s]  And first of all I gotta say,
[13982.72s -> 13986.56s]  Kristen you've been like a sister to me so far
[13986.56s -> 13989.52s]  over these last probably 15 years or so.
[13990.52s -> 13992.44s]  I really didn't think that it was ever going to happen
[13992.44s -> 13995.88s]  because obviously there was all the issues that we had
[13995.88s -> 13996.76s]  as a family.
[13996.76s -> 13999.69s]  But we love you.
[13999.69s -> 14000.73s]  You're a sister to us now.
[14000.73s -> 14003.93s]  I just want to say that really quickly before everyone is clapping.
[14003.93s -> 14004.49s]  Everyone is clapping.
[14008.51s -> 14010.27s]  Dude man I gotta say something.
[14010.27s -> 14011.47s]  Put my little bro over here
[14012.11s -> 14013.39s]  because that's the man of the hour.
[14013.39s -> 14015.88s]  There he is right there bro.
[14016.60s -> 14018.36s]  No no this is for the green screen.
[14019.80s -> 14021.16s]  No this is for the green screen.
[14021.16s -> 14024.14s]  I have to be standing up in a suit for this.
[14030.25s -> 14030.65s]  Save it.
[14031.90s -> 14033.26s]  You have nothing else to do?
[14033.26s -> 14033.76s]  What?
[14034.22s -> 14036.56s]  Can you help with the funeral speech?
[14039.52s -> 14040.88s]  Hey everybody.
[14041.76s -> 14043.76s]  So for those of you on this side of the family
[14043.76s -> 14045.44s]  that don't know I'm Greg.
[14046.96s -> 14048.08s]  Met some of you guys already here.
[14049.12s -> 14050.96s]  But before we get started I gotta say Kristen
[14052.59s -> 14055.07s]  it's been a pleasure having you as part of the family.
[14056.19s -> 14060.20s]  And it's just too bad you're down there.
[14060.92s -> 14061.64s]  Down there now.
[14062.70s -> 14065.66s]  But it was it was an absolute fucking honor.
[14071.48s -> 14072.68s]  No no.
[14082.89s -> 14084.97s]  It's been an honor going down.
[14087.45s -> 14088.65s]  Funeral wedding.
[14091.20s -> 14092.64s]  Wedding slash funeral.
[14094.41s -> 14099.61s]  Now you see the move to China as we've all seen.
[14101.48s -> 14104.20s]  You made it right to us when you get there.
[14106.33s -> 14107.21s]  Same event.
[14108.44s -> 14112.44s]  Oh anyways we talked about the green screen.
[14113.32s -> 14116.68s]  Now I'm going to move some stuff out of the way
[14116.68s -> 14122.08s]  and I'm going to open another game called Red Dead Redemption.
[14124.17s -> 14124.89s]  It's a fun game.
[14125.53s -> 14128.78s]  You can last out people.
[14129.42s -> 14133.15s]  You can shoot people.
[14136.91s -> 14139.07s]  It's probably the most fun I've ever had in a video game.
[14139.07s -> 14147.56s]  But I don't know man.
[14147.56s -> 14152.32s]  It seems like it's going to be pretty hard to do with the internet and all.
[14152.32s -> 14158.43s]  What's the matter?
[14158.43s -> 14165.29s]  I don't understand what you guys are talking about.
[14170.19s -> 14171.55s]  Okay let's go.
[14171.55s -> 14173.76s]  What a bad internet joke.
[14175.20s -> 14177.68s]  Uh I need to put I actually have to desync it again
[14178.48s -> 14181.85s]  because I'm opening up PS4.
[14183.63s -> 14184.99s]  Sorry guys here comes the desync.
[14185.71s -> 14194.54s]  The door behind me looks mildly shocked.
[14195.10s -> 14200.52s]  The door behind me looks mildly shocked.
[14202.32s -> 14204.28s]  Fuck.
[14204.28s -> 14204.60s]  Fuck.
[14205.32s -> 14205.56s]  Fuck.
[14206.28s -> 14206.68s]  Damn it.
[14207.32s -> 14208.41s]  Damn it.
[14211.53s -> 14212.25s]  Almost puked.
[14212.25s -> 14212.89s]  All right let's go.
[14213.61s -> 14214.57s]  Is it even turned on?
[14214.57s -> 14215.13s]  No it's not.
[14222.22s -> 14223.02s]  Whatever.
[14223.02s -> 14225.60s]  Uh I gotta update the...
[14225.60s -> 14226.96s]  Hold on let me get off the camera here
[14226.96s -> 14229.84s]  because I don't like how ugly I am.
[14231.50s -> 14235.08s]  But by the way Lethal League is very good.
[14235.08s -> 14235.56s]  Very fun.
[14236.28s -> 14238.49s]  It's a lot like the first one.
[14239.13s -> 14241.96s]  But the first one was also a ton of fun.
[14241.96s -> 14244.62s]  So doesn't surprise me at all.
[14244.62s -> 14247.24s]  I need to move through this.
[14247.24s -> 14247.96s]  That's all good.
[14247.96s -> 14248.46s]  Okay.
[14255.88s -> 14259.32s]  By the way during the gamer try hard moment
[14260.12s -> 14264.17s]  KingLam gave like 10 gifted subs.
[14264.17s -> 14265.69s]  So thank you so much KingLam.
[14266.41s -> 14271.10s]  I'm just microwaving some food.
[14271.10s -> 14281.61s]  Okay there we go.
