[0.57s -> 15.08s]  Hey. What's up? I'm sorry. Um, yeah. I told you guys I was gonna be live Thursday and Friday.
[15.88s -> 28.97s]  I did say that. But here we are on Wednesday at 8 20 at night. I couldn't wait. I wasn't gonna wait.
[28.97s -> 41.34s]  I'm sorry. I couldn't. I've had the Elton Ring OST playing since the stream stopped two days ago.
[42.30s -> 53.30s]  And it finished. It's like, yo, I want to play. Right when it got 16 hours,
[54.26s -> 67.85s]  42 minutes. I was like, I'm turning the stream on now. Playing Elton Ring. I don't know how long
[67.85s -> 74.54s]  this stream is gonna be. I don't. It's not gonna be long. I maybe a few three, four hours. I just
[74.54s -> 78.54s]  want to play. I want to. And then I'm just like, you know, I want to turn the stream on. Let's go.
[78.54s -> 90.79s]  I wasn't waiting until tomorrow. I couldn't. Is it gamer? You said Thursday. I did.
[92.09s -> 101.05s]  But look, let me be fair to me and this channel. I would like a show of hands. How many of you have
[101.05s -> 107.05s]  seen me tell you that a stream is going to be on Thursday and the stream happens on Saturday?
[108.39s -> 120.82s]  Show of hands, please. Hmm. Seeing a lot of raised hands. I would say that probably happens 70 to 80
[120.82s -> 127.50s]  percent of the time. I'll be like, oh, hey guys, it's Wednesday. Yeah, that's it. That's it for
[127.50s -> 133.74s]  this stream. I'll see you guys on Friday. And then like Monday morning, the suss changes being like
[133.74s -> 142.65s]  Tuesday. So come on. I'm go for the first time in a long time. We are we're doing early suss changes,
[142.65s -> 149.94s]  not late, not delays. We are releasing the streams early now. Last week or so. So this is a reverse
[149.94s -> 155.72s]  delay. This is something you're not used to. I know something I'm not used to. But here we are.
[156.52s -> 169.10s]  Midnight is very early. Well, that's true. I could be for a lot of the EU crowd. It's seven,
[169.10s -> 176.01s]  it's like six, what, five or six o'clock in the morning right now on Thursday. If I stream for
[176.01s -> 180.31s]  like another, if I stream for like four or five hours tonight, it's, it's, I was early to the
[180.31s -> 190.86s]  stream on Thursday. Just think of it that way. That's it. So we, we're just, I got to be very
[190.86s -> 199.02s]  clear though. We're getting close to some real, I probably wouldn't say real end game stuff.
[199.82s -> 210.25s]  This journey is getting closer to coming to an end. I know there's still a lot to do, but
[212.07s -> 220.28s]  I'm getting close. We've received some info last stream that was like, okay, I wonder what that
[220.28s -> 227.05s]  means. We're in one of the final zones of the game, unless they pull some weird shit here that I
[227.05s -> 240.12s]  don't know about. So, okay. Let me just give me one quick second while people trickle in.
[241.27s -> 286.92s]  Grab it. We're good. Where's Otto? I will show Otto at the end of the night. He's comfortable.
[286.92s -> 295.78s]  He's not here. He's very comfortable in another room. I will show Otto before the stream turns
[295.78s -> 305.08s]  off. Okay. If I do not show Otto before the stream turns off, and if the three stooges are not added
[305.08s -> 317.50s]  to Fortnite by April 23rd, I will eat a glove on stream. Nobody showed that to me that I, you know,
[317.50s -> 327.06s]  all of you forgot about it, but I made, okay. I made a thing, a bet like a year ago that said that
[327.06s -> 332.78s]  I was like certain that the three stooges were going to be in Fortnite. Certain of it. Just know
[332.78s -> 336.62s]  like there has to be, right? There's no way that's not going to happen eventually. Don't you can
[336.70s -> 346.46s]  already see the trailer for it. And they'd be like poking each other in the eyes and shit,
[346.46s -> 351.26s]  and they would be jumping over. It probably will happen, but I might just be too early for it.
[351.26s -> 357.18s]  The three stooges are going to be in Fortnite. I'm, I will die on this hill. The three stooges
[357.18s -> 363.34s]  will be in Fortnite before, before the game turns off. I'm telling you right now. I'm telling you.
[368.82s -> 376.34s]  Why? Why is everybody else added to the game? Look at the Fortnite roster and you tell me that
[376.34s -> 388.63s]  that's not, the three stooges wouldn't be there. The Fortnite skin roster right now is like the old
[388.63s -> 397.90s]  Smash Brothers pretend leaks. Like Mrs. Deltfire was on it and stuff. Remember back like in 2000,
[397.90s -> 410.81s]  like fucking 10, 2012, whatever it was. When are you going to get added? I'm not getting added
[410.81s -> 420.23s]  to Fortnite. Three, three stooges are too old news. This is recycled. It's not recycled. It's
[420.23s -> 425.83s]  a rehash. Okay. It's a rerun. There's a lot of new people here that did not hear that classic
[425.83s -> 437.77s]  material. Anyway, they've removed building from the game. You want, I got a theory for you.
[438.73s -> 445.75s]  So I got a theory. They removed building from Fortnite like a, like an event. I think they're
[445.75s -> 450.39s]  testing to see if people like the game more with it off. So then they just don't have to ever turn
[450.39s -> 455.91s]  it back on. They're mick ribbing you guys. Don't you understand? Like they're going to keep doing
[455.91s -> 463.69s]  this. Oh look, no building for like a month. And they're going to keep bringing it back like the
[463.69s -> 474.89s]  mick rib. It's going to happen like once every like six months or so. Game is actually massively
[474.89s -> 478.73s]  improved without it. But here's the problem. They've never added the mick rib permanently
[478.73s -> 491.54s]  to the menu, have they? That's what you have to look at. I'm, I'm not so sure. As, as popular as
[491.54s -> 497.94s]  the mick rib is, it's not on the menu permanently. They did it in German Fortnite.
[502.62s -> 508.22s]  The mick rib is back. Yeah. People will be saying, Oh, building, building is gone again. Look,
[508.78s -> 513.50s]  the non-building game mode is back and you're all going to download it. You're all going to play it.
[522.90s -> 526.50s]  The amount of people on my Twitter feed that are going back to Fortnite because the mick rib is back
[527.14s -> 532.17s]  is astounding. So be aware of that. All right. I'm going to play Elden Ring. Let's go.
[538.70s -> 547.78s]  Well, I look cool from it. Oh, this is where we were last. He looks young. It's going to shaved.
[547.78s -> 551.54s]  I shaved my face and I delete like, well, here's the thing. When I shaved my face,
[552.50s -> 560.81s]  I, I like lose and gain 10 years. Like I always look like 10 years younger,
[560.81s -> 565.93s]  but I always like somehow look like five years older as well. Because when I shave,
[565.93s -> 570.81s]  like this part up here gets really much more defined. Do you see like how old my eyes look
[570.81s -> 576.47s]  and shit? Like I actually kind of have like really old looking eyes. This carries the whole
[576.47s -> 583.78s]  face for me. This is, this will, this carries the entire face. I thought that was a, okay.
[584.34s -> 595.86s]  No game audio. Fuck. Now there is. Yeah. Like from here, damn would I look good in a Batman mask.
[595.86s -> 605.03s]  You understand? Like with the, like with this, like covered, like I would be a great Batman.
[605.59s -> 623.06s]  Your chin's too pointy. I'm that person up for an hour. Not kidding. 10 minutes. All right. So
[623.06s -> 634.46s]  last thing we did, uh, do a Batman voice. Not going to embarrass myself in the first five
[634.46s -> 639.03s]  minutes of this one. All right. So last thing I did, let's take a look at the map in the menu.
[641.99s -> 645.11s]  I can go do this, which is the, how am I, how can I still do that?
[645.67s -> 651.35s]  If I already completed that whole area, right? I can, can I actually do this?
[660.63s -> 665.75s]  I want to explore. Okay. Let me, I gotta make, these are marked. Let's just do it. One, two,
[666.79s -> 671.29s]  I'm going to check this out. I want to, I want to look at this because I want to see from the
[671.29s -> 675.91s]  mountain and I think I'm ready to go. We're on the mountain. This is where we are. Why is this
[675.91s -> 684.01s]  marked? Oh, it's cause it's a, a map thing. All right. So here we go. Uh, we're going to go to
[684.01s -> 691.46s]  this. We're going to go to the left of us right now, which is, uh, how late are you going to
[691.46s -> 697.37s]  stream? I don't know. We're just going to, I'm just going to play. I've been really, really active
[697.37s -> 703.69s]  in the evening hours lately as the last couple of weeks. And I blame that on my sleep schedule,
[703.69s -> 707.13s]  kind of getting detonated after the streamer awards. Cause I had like a
[708.01s -> 713.26s]  politis slash proctitis flare up that kind of fucked me up for a little while. Uh,
[713.26s -> 718.46s]  so I'm kind of on a weird schedule at the moment, but I'm awake. I'm alert now. Can I level up?
[720.18s -> 731.85s]  I can shit. All right. What am I going to do? He's a vampire. No, I'm not a vampire.
[731.85s -> 737.86s]  I couldn't cut it. I wouldn't, I wouldn't be cut out to be a vampire. Uh, health.
[740.34s -> 749.54s]  You, okay. Like drinking other people's blood. No, no, I, I don't even want to be, I don't even
[749.54s -> 764.02s]  want to be near anybody else's blood ever. No one tell them. That's what a vampire would say.
[767.67s -> 773.51s]  I don't, that's part, that's a huge part of being a vampire is drinking somebody else's blood.
[774.23s -> 779.14s]  But it's not something I'm going to do. That's fucking, I don't like it. I don't like, no,
[779.22s -> 789.99s]  I don't like blood. Nope. Werewolf. I would rather be a werewolf a hundred times. Do I have to
[789.99s -> 793.19s]  actually answer that question? Like vampire, you got me to get to live forever, but you have to
[793.19s -> 799.93s]  drink other people's blood all the time. Werewolf. You get to like change into a werewolf. That's
[799.93s -> 804.09s]  kind of cool. Right? Like I could just be like, I could just hang out as me. And then there's a
[804.09s -> 809.53s]  full moon. I just like, and I'm looking strong and shit. And like, I'm really powerful and I'm
[809.53s -> 816.25s]  really smart too. And I'm handsome and I have a cool tail. And I, um, I can read it at least
[816.25s -> 827.90s]  11th grade level after I change. All right, let's kill this guy. You got a lot of help.
[827.90s -> 847.74s]  Oh, it's a lot for you. I get off the horse. These guys, I can fight these guys off the horse.
[847.74s -> 864.46s]  I did not say that. Wait, I have a question. Is a werewolf a furry? Yes. I don't think so.
[865.34s -> 895.90s]  No, I don't think so. I think that's wrong. How much health does he have?
[901.37s -> 909.38s]  Okay. For me, a furry is somebody that is an anthropomorphic animal person. Right? That's kind
[909.38s -> 915.62s]  of what it is. A werewolf is somebody that is like a person that changes into a wolf, like a
[915.62s -> 922.52s]  wolf person at night. Are there furries that say I'm not a furry unless it's like 11 o'clock at night?
[924.07s -> 934.60s]  That's, that's no. Like, oh, okay. If you asked me if I was like a furry, like at like four o'clock
[934.60s -> 939.06s]  in the afternoon, I said no. Then like at 10 o'clock at night, you said, are you a furry?
[939.06s -> 954.09s]  And I was like, yeah, dude, that doesn't make any sense. Am I going to use an entire fight to kill
[954.09s -> 961.00s]  this guy? I'm just saying what is that? What are the rules? I don't know what the rules are.
[961.72s -> 989.16s]  A lot of lock on. Oh, I don't, huh? What are the cat ears? Cat is not a werewolf. Sorry. I like,
[989.16s -> 999.42s]  do I, I'm sorry. I like a cat is not a werewolf. And I don't want to be, okay, let me, let me
[999.42s -> 1005.10s]  clarify this too. When I say I turn into a werewolf, like if I was a werewolf, it's not like,
[1005.10s -> 1008.86s]  oh, I'm just, I kind of like get a little taller and I get some like scruff and I have ears now.
[1008.86s -> 1013.74s]  No, like I'm going to be like a gnarled like fucking monster. You know what I mean? Like we
[1013.74s -> 1029.22s]  get fucked up looking like terrifying, awful looking like we had hunched like spine like,
[1030.50s -> 1033.94s]  like I'm not, I don't, I'm not going to be handsome looking. Let me be really clear about that.
[1034.58s -> 1049.27s]  Is that, did he drop anything? No, like a bloodborne werewolf. Yes. That is exactly what
[1049.27s -> 1055.00s]  I'm talking about. They're terrifying. Like when you turn into a werewolf, it's not like, oh, I,
[1055.00s -> 1060.92s]  my like shoulders get a little more broad and my like chin gets more defined. And I get a little
[1060.92s -> 1064.92s]  snout and ears. And I like, oh, look at me though. I'm still, I'm looking at how handsome I am. No,
[1064.92s -> 1078.28s]  no, no. I want to be one of the werewolves from fucking bloodborne. Where am I going? I don't
[1078.28s -> 1090.38s]  want to be able to talk. Right. Cause to me, that's a werewolf. Like I don't want to change into this
[1090.38s -> 1097.72s]  werewolf at night. Like, no. Okay. Um, let me think. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, right? Like you,
[1097.72s -> 1102.20s]  Mr. Hyde, you didn't want Mr. Hyde. Like, but at like midnight, Mr. Hyde was going to come out if
[1102.20s -> 1109.34s]  he ate food after midnight. That's the gremlins. Um, who's the werewolf? What am I, what werewolf,
[1109.34s -> 1123.02s]  what werewolf am I talking about? I know it's the fucking gremlins. I'm not like other furries.
[1133.56s -> 1138.46s]  Okay. Well, I didn't want to look at this. So I'm here. I'm not like other, I'm not, I'm just
[1138.46s -> 1142.22s]  saying I would rather, this all stemmed because somebody said, would you rather be a werewolf
[1142.22s -> 1147.66s]  for a vampire? And I don't like the idea of drinking blood. So I would rather be a werewolf.
[1148.46s -> 1155.32s]  But wait, werewolves, do werewolves eat people? I would still have to consume blood because I
[1155.32s -> 1178.10s]  would be eating people. This whole thing got fucked up because I don't, I didn't think,
[1178.10s -> 1199.56s]  I didn't think this was really that bad. Greedy. Oh my God. These guys die in one hit. Oh fuck.
[1199.56s -> 1219.78s]  That guy needs to die right now. I don't know why I didn't think he was the same insane greedy.
[1222.49s -> 1233.50s]  Oh my goodness. Oh my God. Why can't I fucking dodge this guy? It's because this little dickhead
[1233.50s -> 1239.67s]  is right next to him and it's like fucking up my timings. You were dead already like an hour ago,
[1239.67s -> 1248.70s]  it seems. Why do I feel like this baby rattle lost 80% of its range overnight? What the fuck
[1248.70s -> 1270.74s]  is going on here? Yeah. I cannot step. You are the stupidest fucking enemy in the goddamn game.
[1271.70s -> 1285.24s]  Die already. I just used eight potions. His face is red. It's always red. Don't make the werewolf
[1285.24s -> 1293.00s]  come out. Yeah, don't feed me after midnight. When I get angry, I turn into a werewolf. It's
[1293.00s -> 1299.78s]  not about the moon. It's not about like howling at the moon. Can I just be like four fictional
[1299.78s -> 1311.58s]  characters combined? Yeah, that'd be a werewolf but like with like a green Sonic the Hedgehog stripe
[1311.58s -> 1333.80s]  of hair. A gamma radiated werewolf. Okay, fuck you. Hold on. Goku. Yeah, and I'm a Saiyan. Oh, die.
[1340.90s -> 1350.60s]  OC. God, all those cars. You know, like when I think of the Hulk, that would be so awful. Do
[1350.60s -> 1355.46s]  you know how many times I just get fucking angry? It would be so bad. I would never be able to
[1355.46s -> 1359.62s]  control it. You know how many times I've been in my car just like fucking furious?
[1360.58s -> 1368.12s]  Imagine like turning into the Hulk in like your car. That would be so fucked up.
[1368.92s -> 1376.65s]  When you cut somebody off and they're like, hey, and they go like, yeah, fuck you buddy. You give
[1376.65s -> 1381.93s]  him like the finger out the window and then this person speeds by you like 15 seconds later.
[1381.93s -> 1385.85s]  Their head is outside of the car and they're big and green and they're like coming after you.
[1387.05s -> 1410.14s]  What's that meltdown? Yeah, I would be, it would be bad. So many times that I just get so just I
[1410.14s -> 1414.62s]  turn on it like just Donald Duck. You know what I mean? Like I just get so just worked up.
[1416.01s -> 1431.38s]  I would never be a good Hulk. Who's shooting a bone arrow at me? That's an invisible ridge.
[1431.38s -> 1441.16s]  Just hold on. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Invisible Andy. Okay. Yeah. 100% that's an invisible ridge. Oh,
[1441.16s -> 1467.21s]  invisible Andy. Yeah. Game crashed. You guys crashed my fucking computer. What the fuck?
[1468.09s -> 1486.04s]  What the fuck? It just actually crashed my whole computer. I'm stuck here. Um,
[1486.68s -> 1497.29s]  okay. Hold on a second. Oh Jesus. This is bad. All right. I'll be right back if the stream turns
[1497.29s -> 1506.28s]  off. This is actually really bad. I can't even like get rid of this. I can't, I can't alt F4
[1506.28s -> 1515.69s]  the game either. Fuck. Come on. It's doing that thing with my task manager is on the same screen
[1515.69s -> 1528.44s]  as the fucking game. So I can't go to the task manager. I cannot go to my task manager. How do
[1528.44s -> 1536.09s]  I get a tab? Windows key and tab. Yeah. Let me, well, I got it. No, I didn't. It keeps going
[1536.09s -> 1540.74s]  behind the game. Yeah. I, I pull it up. Okay. I think my whole computer is going down. The whole
[1540.74s -> 1545.45s]  computer is going down. I'll see you guys in a minute. My whole computer is going down.
[1545.45s -> 1561.06s]  The whole thing's coming down. I'll be back in a minute. Fuck. What? Dude, I can't get it.
[1565.02s -> 1572.57s]  Windows tab. And then like, I can't get it. No, this, I'm going to have to, I have to restart
[1572.57s -> 1577.21s]  the computer. I got to like turn, I got to hold the power button on. Use the arrow keys. I can't.
[1579.85s -> 1585.69s]  Go look at the fucking invisible bridge. You invisible bridge Andes. I would have been fine.
[1587.21s -> 1595.24s]  Windows key plus right. Oh, it's not doing anything. I can, I can get it on my screen,
[1595.24s -> 1610.66s]  but it immediately goes away. Real tough. There's an option to have task manager always on top.
[1611.90s -> 1618.26s]  Yeah. I mean, I just selected it. Oh my God. That person, unfucking believable. You just
[1618.26s -> 1623.82s]  saved the whole stream. Yeah. You just literally saved the stream. Okay. I'm coming back. We're
[1623.82s -> 1636.78s]  good. You just actually saved the stream. Thank you. Well, I don't know how much progress we just,
[1636.78s -> 1645.26s]  we didn't really progress that much, but that was weird. What the fuck? Kind of afraid to see
[1645.26s -> 1657.18s]  where we end up now. Yeah. For those of you that want to know what I did, if you right click in
[1657.18s -> 1665.00s]  the task manager, like that little icon, you can say always on top and it worked. What an absolute
[1665.00s -> 1671.29s]  genius. Did you mod that guy? No. You should VIP him. I mean, that was pretty, that was pretty
[1671.29s -> 1679.85s]  POG, but see if they have any other POG related things in the near future. Oh, I want to show
[1679.85s -> 1687.11s]  this too. Hold on. Somebody, somebody actually made this. I need to see this on. Remember,
[1687.11s -> 1691.54s]  do you remember yesterday when I did like the comedy routine joke? Let's do that right now,
[1691.54s -> 1695.62s]  actually, before I, because my Elden Ring is like freaking out. It's like, I need to download the
[1695.62s -> 1710.81s]  cloud. So hold on. I want to do this. Not that. I love that's the last thing that was saved.
[1710.81s -> 1718.46s]  These are really romantic candles. So I made a reference. Like the stupid candle routine was
[1718.46s -> 1726.30s]  just essentially a comedy routine. So let's see how this plays out. These are really romantic
[1726.30s -> 1738.09s]  candles. Oh, it probably stinks up here. I, gosh, I filled the room with the red candles like you
[1738.09s -> 1749.00s]  wanted. Gary, you fucking idiot. Did you have to get the red cinnamon apple candle from Yankee
[1749.00s -> 1753.85s]  Candle and put it in every room? We have to, we're gonna have to fucking open the windows and not
[1753.85s -> 1760.74s]  come back here for like a week. That's one of the most powerful, that's one of the most powerful of
[1760.74s -> 1769.80s]  all the candles and I hate them. I swear to God, I can tell, I can tell when a neighbor likes one
[1769.80s -> 1779.02s]  of those candles. Drives me crazy. Is that like cinnamon, it's like the fall cinnamon cider apple
[1779.02s -> 1784.30s]  one? It's just like, no, I like it for like a second but I don't want to fill my whole neighborhood
[1784.30s -> 1800.95s]  with that. The cough at the end. That was, Marie made that. Thank you, Marie. That was really funny.
[1801.75s -> 1809.42s]  You know what's weird? Old television shows and even current television shows, they just like make
[1809.42s -> 1815.26s]  you think that something was that funny. When it just, you almost, the laugh track was sort of like
[1815.26s -> 1820.97s]  I don't want to be left out kind of thing, right? Where it's like, you don't want to be left out
[1820.97s -> 1825.37s]  because people are laughing at something. So if you don't laugh, it's like, fuck, I'm the only
[1825.37s -> 1839.99s]  person not doing that. I guess I have to. I love knowing when to laugh. I have a video that plays a
[1839.99s -> 1848.97s]  laugh track sometimes randomly during your streams. Somebody's called me a dumbass. Why?
[1848.97s -> 1857.50s]  What the hell, man? Why? Don't, dumbass. What the heck? Brew. What? I didn't do anything.
[1858.14s -> 1864.41s]  Why do you think I'm a dumbass? All right, I'm coming back. Hopefully this isn't fucking,
[1864.41s -> 1874.94s]  I don't care if that's an invisible bridge. I'm not going over there. Okay, I'm already getting
[1874.94s -> 1880.94s]  like shot by an arrow. Wait, that's it. I don't want to look at that. I am terrified to actually
[1880.94s -> 1889.24s]  go look at that. Well, you got a shirt change. Yeah. All right. Hey, let me get my bearings for
[1889.24s -> 1898.41s]  a second. What the fuck is happening? All right. I don't want, if it's going to crash the game,
[1898.41s -> 1903.35s]  what am I, I don't, I'm scared to go over there. A game crash there too. It should be fine. Now
[1924.38s -> 1940.66s]  there should be a lean down button on the horse. Just get off. All right. What's going on?
[1940.66s -> 1944.82s]  Something. Look at how weird this looks. Something's wrong here already. There's
[1944.82s -> 1948.66s]  something weird with the shadows. I don't know. This is fucking up. Look at something's wrong
[1948.66s -> 1956.89s]  with this. I don't want to be here. Look at how fucked up like the triangle shadows and shit.
[1956.89s -> 1968.94s]  Something's wrong over here. Run, run dude. Is there actually an invisible bridge here? This
[1968.94s -> 1985.48s]  whole area feels like broken. I thought the game crashed. I thought the game crashed. Okay. All
[1985.48s -> 1996.90s]  right. All right. All right. All right. So it wasn't bullshit. Wait, I need rainbow stones.
[1996.90s -> 2033.42s]  I have a shit load. Don't I have nine? I can make way more than that. Okay. Here we go. What if it
[2033.42s -> 2057.75s]  ends? It's just gonna fucking end. Where does this go? Can I throw them? I'm so afraid that it's
[2057.75s -> 2089.83s]  going to end. I think I'm already falling off. Holy shit. I can't go that way either. What? All
[2089.83s -> 2106.95s]  right. We can go this way. Oh, fuck. I'm going to run out of these things. I think I'm going to run
[2106.95s -> 2120.54s]  out. What? People are laughing at me. You lost on a straight line. What? What do you mean? I couldn't
[2120.54s -> 2137.06s]  go that way. What do you mean? It gets... What? Did I get... Are you sure? Why was I going to fall
[2137.06s -> 2166.49s]  off over there? Am I stupid? Just go. Just go. What happened there? It goes straight. Stop.
[2166.49s -> 2181.75s]  You're fucking lying. You're a liar. Oh, why does this... Okay. I think I got it. So it's only...
[2181.75s -> 2207.75s]  Okay. It's... I get it. Okay. I understand. All right. No, I'm afraid. Does this turn left?
[2208.76s -> 2220.04s]  It probably turns left here. There's no way it leads right here. It's going to go that way.
[2220.04s -> 2236.30s]  Okay. Yeah. Just run forward. Just run forward and die. I don't think those things... I hope
[2236.30s -> 2258.79s]  these things are not used for anything else. Yeah. It's a straight line, Jerma. It's a straight line.
[2258.79s -> 2286.76s]  You don't know how to run in a straight line? What the fuck? What? I see... I know I have to
[2286.76s -> 2306.73s]  go there, but I'm afraid of just going there. What keeps happening? All right. This is an
[2306.73s -> 2343.48s]  invisible wall then? It's not. Shit. This is not an invisible wall? What the fuck am I
[2343.48s -> 2353.18s]  supposed to do about this? I can't make that jump from here. Hit it multiple times.
[2355.22s -> 2360.94s]  There's nothing here, man. Why is there an invisible bridge that leads into a wall?
[2360.94s -> 2398.57s]  I don't know. This has to be a reason. Really? What's the point? What? Look for the mist.
[2408.50s -> 2447.02s]  Oh, shit. Whoa. Do these stay permanently? It looks like a Christmas decoration. All right.
[2447.02s -> 2450.78s]  I'm gonna put one here just so I remember that I can actually do this. I'm gonna put one back
[2450.78s -> 2454.70s]  there because I want to make sure I know that I can actually do this. All right. Well, that was
[2454.70s -> 2465.18s]  fucking cool. The reticle... the seal on the rise opened. I need like a bonfire or something.
[2478.30s -> 2484.04s]  I can't believe you actually did an invisible bridge. I thought you guys were fucking with me.
[2484.04s -> 2511.69s]  All right. Let's go up. Hold on. I gotta move this. Oh. Up. I need a place to heal or something.
[2511.69s -> 2523.48s]  This is probably like a memory stone or something. He almost growled at us. Memory stone? All these
[2523.48s -> 2534.95s]  rises have sorcery stuff, so why would we ever fuck with you? I don't know. You crashed my...
[2536.89s -> 2542.92s]  crashed my computer like 20 minutes ago. I'm holding you responsible for everything else going
[2542.92s -> 2551.10s]  forward. Oh, memory stone, right? It has to be. That's a legendary memory stone.
[2552.14s -> 2564.65s]  Founding Reign of Stars. Releases a downpour of star rain for a while.
[2568.04s -> 2573.54s]  Sorcery of legendary status. Summons a dark cloud of stars overhead. Shortly after the cloud will
[2573.54s -> 2580.78s]  release a violent deluge of star rain. This sorcery can be cast while in motion. It's about to be the
[2580.78s -> 2590.73s]  founding glintstone sorcery. All right. I'll try it. It's a golden legendary. Yeah. That's cool.
[2591.37s -> 2602.81s]  I'll check it out. All right. I gotta mock this. Sword means I did it and like did the thing in
[2602.81s -> 2610.18s]  there. I started to try to do that before, but I gotta start doing that because I will look at
[2610.18s -> 2616.46s]  the map and go, what's this? Heretical rise? What's that thing? That's cool. All right. So let me...
[2616.46s -> 2621.99s]  I can just leave from here. Is there... are there gonna be a bonfire somewhere in this building?
[2626.87s -> 2639.11s]  All right. Yeah. When I... people are asking like what's with the Boston accent? Anytime...
[2639.11s -> 2641.91s]  I mean, if Starlight's in the inventory, then like it's gonna come out.
[2643.26s -> 2647.66s]  Like if I have... if I got Starlight in my pocket, like I can... it'll come out.
[2648.46s -> 2657.10s]  There's what? When this comes off, if I replace Starlight, then it'll probably go away. I apologize
[2657.10s -> 2673.91s]  so I can advance. I'm sorry. I can hit it. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I forgot about that.
[2674.47s -> 2683.02s]  I want to do that too. I want to go get the remembrance so I can do cold sorceresses.
[2684.22s -> 2702.30s]  That was part of the plan too. Wait, is that a painting? It's not. You know, uh, okay. I've got
[2702.30s -> 2710.38s]  a disappointment. I've got one disappointment for you. Falling snow marks something unseen.
[2710.38s -> 2718.14s]  Oh, I did this whole... I did this backwards. I just went completely in reverse. Okay. Well,
[2718.14s -> 2724.06s]  they're weird. Uh, I've got a Elden Ring complaint for you and it's not a complaint as much as it's
[2724.06s -> 2729.42s]  I wish there were more. I thought there were going to be way more of those hidden kind of
[2729.42s -> 2735.32s]  area painting things. There's some of my favorite parts of the entire game. I wish there was a ton
[2735.32s -> 2742.74s]  of them. Going to find that one little spot is so cool. It's so fun. It's so much more like reason
[2742.74s -> 2749.43s]  to kind of go explore. There's like six in the game that I've found so far and there's probably
[2749.43s -> 2760.66s]  like 10 to 12 in the game total. I wish there was like 30. I love that. I love trying to find that
[2760.66s -> 2767.11s]  one little spot. Okay, this my computer is not happy. My computer is not happy right now here.
[2767.75s -> 2782.33s]  This area is really just like my computer hates it. I need a bonfire. So bad. I caught
[2782.33s -> 2798.70s]  him. It's actually pretty good. No horse Andy. I'm just exploring. Oh shit. This is gonna take me
[2798.70s -> 2805.67s]  down here. I don't want to do that yet. Maybe I'll get the map fragment. Yeah, let me get the map.
[2805.67s -> 2819.29s]  Just let me get the map fragment. I'll come back. That looks suspicious over there. There are seven
[2819.29s -> 2827.46s]  paintings. I did. I've done like four or five. How many we've done? Like what? Four? That's pretty
[2827.46s -> 2849.88s]  sus over there. It is. Stop making me say that. All right, seriously need a bonfire because I want
[2849.88s -> 2861.05s]  to go get the remembrance from Ronella. Are you wearing red because you're the imposter? Yes.
[2868.58s -> 2882.39s]  All right. Worst noise. So clip it and put it in your inbox or something for later this year.
[2883.19s -> 2896.15s]  I'm not going to tell you what you can and cannot nominate. Yeah, I'll get the map fragment. I'm
[2896.15s -> 2910.66s]  very curious. What was that? I don't know. Oh, Evergold. Everjail. Lord Contenders Everjail.
[2910.66s -> 2916.47s]  Should we just go here? Is there a statue here? Because I don't want to do this unless there is.
[2917.19s -> 2928.76s]  Is there a statue? There is right here. Okay. Let's just go lose. Look under your HP bar.
[2930.34s -> 2951.74s]  Oh right, yeah. Okay, let me try it. This is a boss. Let's go. Round Table Knight Mike? I don't
[2951.74s -> 2990.26s]  know what that does. What's he doing? Hey, what? An actual named boss can drink a potion
[2990.26s -> 3038.55s]  with a bar at the bottom? I don't think I've seen that. Oh, fuck. Oh, he's trying to drink
[3038.55s -> 3080.98s]  another potion. Oh, don't be greedy. Oh, fuck. A clean finish. Mike's Dragon Bolt. Fingerprint
[3080.98s -> 3092.57s]  helm. That was a clean fight. Somebody just said, where is that? I'll show you right now.
[3093.05s -> 3098.25s]  It is in the mountaintop of giants. Looks like along this road that comes down here. I don't
[3098.25s -> 3111.62s]  know the map fragments. Sorry. It's this Everjail. Lord Contenders Everjail. What does that say?
[3111.62s -> 3119.14s]  Bolsters right hand, armament, and body with red lightning. Incantation of Vike,
[3119.14s -> 3124.02s]  Knight of the Round Table Hold. Summons red lightning to bolster both the caster's body
[3124.02s -> 3130.76s]  and their armament held in the right hand. So it enchants your weapon with red lightning.
[3133.08s -> 3136.92s]  Enchants armament with lightning affinity attacks and increases maximum equipment load.
[3137.48s -> 3151.26s]  That's weird. This is the From Software armor? What do you mean? Fingerprint armor.
[3163.78s -> 3169.30s]  Iron armor signed and blistered by fingers. Born by Vike, Knight of the Round Table Hold.
[3169.30s -> 3172.34s]  No other Tarnished was closer to the throne of the Elden Lord than Vike.
[3172.98s -> 3177.62s]  But without announcement, Vike traveled far below the capital and was scorched by the flame of
[3177.62s -> 3183.06s]  frenzy. Did he make his choice for his maiden or did some other force lure him with suggestion?
[3186.50s -> 3203.14s]  Oh, it's Box Art Andy. Really? Is it? Box Art Andy. Okay. This helm is potentially better than
[3203.14s -> 3213.56s]  what I have on, but it doesn't boost sorceries. Is this the Box Art? I thought the Box Art had
[3213.56s -> 3226.73s]  like kind of hair coming back. Old goat gauntlets? What the fuck are these? Fingerprint greaves.
[3228.47s -> 3234.44s]  All right, I'd like my setup right now. The raging wolf armor is the Box Art armor. Yeah,
[3234.44s -> 3241.70s]  I thought the Box Art had hair out there. Using the trailer armor. That was cool. That's a cool
[3241.70s -> 3247.02s]  spell too. I wonder if it's any good. But it's a From Software game, so no, it's not going to be.
[3248.30s -> 3255.50s]  That'll go on the list of like, okay, From Software like spell tier list. Let's say we have S, A,
[3256.22s -> 3262.78s]  B, and whatever. Literally B, A, B, C, and D don't matter. There's like five moves that are at S
[3262.78s -> 3266.86s]  and then 70 that are at do not equip, like at the very bottom, like under F.
[3268.30s -> 3283.43s]  So probably looks cool. You should equip a branch. I got 100,000 souls. This is gonna get ugly real
[3283.43s -> 3293.96s]  quick. I need a I need a bonfire. Min-max Andy. I mean, I'm obviously just, you know, taking a piss,
[3293.96s -> 3303.67s]  but not these. Yeah, but whenever I get a new spell, it seems I'll be like, oh, dude,
[3303.67s -> 3309.19s]  star shards from outer space. And the sea of chat is just like, oh, no, dude, they're worthless.
[3309.19s -> 3313.59s]  It's like fucking awful. It takes like 80% of your mana bar, and it does like 12 damage. It's like,
[3313.59s -> 3325.53s]  oh, okay. Oh, Glimblade of the Distressed Soldier. No, dude, don't even put it on.
[3326.25s -> 3331.53s]  It's way too slow, and just swinging your regular weapon will hurt for more.
[3331.53s -> 3342.68s]  Okay, I guess. All right, I'm gonna die from one of these. Get on the road.
[3343.32s -> 3359.45s]  Ooh, what's this? Thank you. Although it's fun to have like the sorceries and then some of the
[3359.45s -> 3375.82s]  incantations. They're cool. Founding stars is OP though. You should talk to, wait, can I talk?
[3377.67s -> 3389.26s]  I can. All right, shh. We're almost there. The Flame of Ruin lies just ahead. Just ahead. I'm glad
[3389.26s -> 3396.62s]  it was you I traveled with. I must tender my thanks to Torrent too. Thank you, Torrent.
[3397.26s -> 3406.66s]  Please continue to lend your aid till the end. There is something I'd like to say. My purpose
[3406.66s -> 3416.63s]  was given to me by my mother, but now I act of my own volition. I have set my heart upon the world
[3416.63s -> 3425.34s]  that I would have, regardless of my mother's designs. This is America's daughter. It's America's daughter.
[3426.22s -> 3435.67s]  Not even you. Man, it is, right?
[3436.39s -> 3459.08s]  Can you talk to her again? I don't think so. Oh, right. I want to try that new move. Let's see.
[3459.08s -> 3466.36s]  Come on, From Software. Give me a move that's not swift boring glint blade, swift pebble stone.
[3467.00s -> 3493.19s]  That was works and is good. Can't take that off. Where is it? Oh, it takes two slots. All right,
[3493.19s -> 3520.97s]  a hundred and how much FP does it cost to do this? That lasts a long time. Okay.
[3522.25s -> 3528.31s]  Let's test it out on this unsuspecting loser right here. Hey, just stand right there for me,
[3528.31s -> 3549.50s]  if you will. It's okay. It's all right. I mean, it's actually that would be really good if the
[3549.50s -> 3558.74s]  group is chasing you around. I did. I charged it. Let's just aggro everybody. Let's like see what
[3558.74s -> 3576.17s]  happens. All right, let's go like fucking run around. Somebody come and get me. It kind of
[3576.17s -> 3586.65s]  hurts my eyes. Probably good for stationary large bosses. That's true. I'll leave it on.
[3586.65s -> 3598.39s]  It hits large enemies a lot. Okay. It doesn't actually take that much mana as much as I thought
[3598.39s -> 3606.18s]  it was going to. I thought it was going to be a lot more. Let's go. It's a cool spell. I like it.
[3609.21s -> 3625.27s]  Charge it. I am. I've charged it every time. Do you want me to prove it to you? I've been doing
[3625.27s -> 3634.60s]  that every time. It's kind of like a dot. Okay. Here's why I'm going to keep it on. Its surface
[3634.60s -> 3641.10s]  area is actually huge and it lasts a very, very long time. It doesn't take that long to cast it
[3641.10s -> 3648.55s]  either. So I think it could be supplemental. She just said that like this is the end of the
[3648.55s -> 3654.23s]  game coming up here. She's like, oh, here it is. This is right ahead. Right. I'm kind of afraid
[3654.23s -> 3659.61s]  to do this right now. I'm right. Like I don't want to do this. I don't want to end the game.
[3666.06s -> 3713.74s]  Oh, okay. All right. I don't, I don't hate it. I actually think it's kind of good. Oh, it hurt.
[3751.40s -> 3773.26s]  Oh, I thought I fell off the cliff. Why did I just have an accent?
[3774.38s -> 3799.27s]  Why did I just have like a Italian accent? Oh, damn. I don't know why. I just had like a,
[3799.27s -> 3801.67s]  I had like a European accent for a second there. What was that?
[3808.41s -> 3813.05s]  Don't just run around. What's going on with my voice? It's because I have two headphones in.
[3816.10s -> 3827.94s]  I have two. I can't hear myself talk. So like, it's weird. Holy shit. What is that thing?
[3830.71s -> 3853.99s]  Walk over here. Huh? Why did it turn off? I can't cast it multiple times.
[3855.27s -> 3877.59s]  I want it to rain down on these motherfuckers. It was patched. Was it actually? Can't cast two of
[3877.59s -> 3885.35s]  them. Yeah, that's kind of annoying. I need to swap out some stuff because I'm doing too much like
[3885.35s -> 3887.75s]  click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click,
[3887.75s -> 3915.74s]  the herd tree chest. Uh, I still, I want the map fragment. I'll all right. Mark this right here.
[3916.98s -> 3919.62s]  Remember to remind me to come back to two because I want to go inside of there,
[3919.62s -> 3931.88s]  but I want the map fragment and we're going to go get it. I gotta go get the other staff too.
[3932.84s -> 3952.50s]  It's so good. All right. Somebody said fuck toad.
[3953.62s -> 4003.08s]  All right. Let's see if we can get a triple here. It's truly amazing. What do you say? What
[4005.02s -> 4016.02s]  moonlight spell? How did you get the moon blade? Uh, it was, I forget. Oh no, it's from the dragon.
[4016.74s -> 4024.47s]  It's from the glint stone dragon that's in front of, um, that hangs around the Ronnie's, um,
[4024.47s -> 4034.38s]  and the rises, right? It's from the magic dragon. Keep going. I want the map fragment.
[4040.44s -> 4049.59s]  These are weird. Is it a little, um, statue like things? Oh God damn it. Where is the
[4049.59s -> 4059.24s]  map fragment? It's not all the way down there, right? Oh, it's right there. Isn't it?
[4059.80s -> 4079.21s]  This is a no. Okay. It's probably right here. That's right there. Jesus. These guys alive
[4079.21s -> 4085.93s]  and not. Oh, I thought that was one of those ghost people to talk to. This is a rock.
[4087.50s -> 4091.42s]  I didn't skip the castle. No, no, no, no, no. I'm coming here to get the map fragment first.
[4095.74s -> 4102.28s]  I'm, I just want the map fragment. There we go. All right. Now I can see what the hell is going
[4102.28s -> 4113.98s]  on here. All right. So this is where this looks. What is that? I don't know, but I'm not skipping
[4113.98s -> 4119.70s]  this. I just wanted the map. I can see where the hell I was. There's also something really
[4119.70s -> 4124.58s]  interesting here, which is what we're going to look at. I'm going to go do the fort here.
[4126.18s -> 4138.14s]  Is there a random mog like enemy incoming? I'm going to go in there. No,
[4141.00s -> 4153.99s]  no, it's not what we're doing. Where is the, where's the bell place? It's like here somewhere,
[4153.99s -> 4165.56s]  right? I want that remembrance because I want that stuff. Where is it? Hurry up and tell me.
[4165.56s -> 4174.07s]  Where is it? Northeast Lake. Fucking hurry up. When I asked something, I expect there to be
[4174.07s -> 4178.42s]  something in the fucking chat immediately. None of this like talking, talking, like hanging out,
[4178.42s -> 4187.91s]  having fun. No, when I asked something, fucking answer it. Fucking unbelievable. Where was it?
[4187.91s -> 4200.09s]  Where? I didn't even see it. Stop spamming the chat. I'm quitting tomorrow. I quit. I quit tomorrow.
[4201.26s -> 4212.10s]  Wait, where is it? The Eastern part of the lake. Worst face. Werewolf face. I'm sorry, the moon,
[4212.10s -> 4232.74s]  the moon's up. Northeast. I'm just going to go here. Northeast next to the castle. Like right
[4232.74s -> 4235.70s]  over here around. I'll just go look around for it. Yeah. It's like, isn't it right here?
[4237.19s -> 4255.27s]  It was walking around here. You've changed. I know. I know. Just like, I just hate being here.
[4256.23s -> 4261.00s]  All right. Would you guys, let me ask you a question. Those are the viewers.
[4261.56s -> 4268.17s]  Right. Would that be, okay. If I was like that, would that be funny? Would you be watching to
[4268.17s -> 4274.57s]  watch me have like a meltdown? Is that like funny? Or like, would you like not, would you be like,
[4274.57s -> 4278.81s]  nah, I don't want to watch this guy. This guy like is a fucking dick. He's like always hates like
[4283.11s -> 4297.77s]  Hey, who did that? Oh, depends on if it's a joke. Yeah. I'd be sad. No, it's never going to get there.
[4297.77s -> 4305.40s]  Don't worry. You guys already know the minute that I'm not having a good time anymore. It's
[4305.40s -> 4314.65s]  like, all right, that's it. Right? Like that's it. That's not, don't worry. I would subscribe for
[4314.65s -> 4325.08s]  like meltdowns. Would you? Well, I think I already do that. North like up here. Did I,
[4325.72s -> 4338.54s]  I feel like it's not over here. Is it even further up here? East literally. You literally
[4338.54s -> 4353.08s]  looked at it. North east of regular area here. It's to the east. You're staring at it. Oh,
[4353.08s -> 4367.91s]  but like my view distance is low. I actually haven't made this one sit down. Did I? Yeah.
[4367.91s -> 4387.74s]  I made the other ones. There's a lot of fucking people here. Your IRL view distance. Yeah. This
[4387.74s -> 4399.24s]  one's not moving for like my head and the bell. Uh, there's nothing to brush off either. I have
[4399.24s -> 4431.88s]  to do something else. Yeah. Ring the bell. That's what I'm gonna try. I don't think I can hit it.
[4441.75s -> 4453.48s]  Um, there's a dungeon over there that I didn't do. Ah, me strong will do it. All right. Except
[4453.48s -> 4456.28s]  what about the people that are around the bell? Maybe if I aggro the people that are around the
[4456.28s -> 4465.72s]  bell, right? That makes sense. All right. So it's just like, okay, here it goes. I'm like whacking
[4465.72s -> 4482.71s]  the spirits over here and you can hear the screams of the spirits to jump on it. How the fuck am I
[4482.71s -> 4511.62s]  supposed to jump on it from here? I'm up there. Teleport to this grace above, like up here. You
[4511.62s -> 4567.30s]  mean bugged? It's supposed to be moving. Give me the item. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[4567.94s -> 4585.45s]  So I have to jump from up here. We're going down together. How am I supposed to land on that?
[4585.45s -> 4597.99s]  I don't understand. How am I supposed to land on that? Okay. Is it like one of those is this soft?
[4598.63s -> 4619.13s]  Wait, I already have one of these right here. I get to use this one. Okay. Cool. Oh, oh,
[4637.78s -> 4645.22s]  I need the other one. How am I supposed to get onto that? I definitely, it's probably a jump from
[4645.22s -> 4649.46s]  here and you can, it's probably soft enough on top where it doesn't kill you. But if it does,
[4650.34s -> 4655.14s]  just know that this is an experiment. Somebody said it's bugged. It's supposed to be moving,
[4655.14s -> 4659.22s]  but I mean, would the game really be this bugged over and over again after loading like three
[4659.22s -> 4674.66s]  times? Kill that guy real quick. All right. It's a clear. It is moving. Fuck. It was bugged.
[4674.66s -> 4687.19s]  It was bugged. Come on. Is it only moving certain times of the day? I can't make it from here. So
[4687.19s -> 4700.06s]  we're going to have to go back to where I was. They sleep at night. Well, let me make sure it's
[4700.06s -> 4718.74s]  daytime, like right in the middle of noon or whatever. Well, you, your runes. I don't get out
[4718.74s -> 4749.16s]  of bed for less than 50 K. It was 45. Not what I said. I'll get them. Don't worry. Have you ever
[4749.16s -> 4755.99s]  played Ocarina of Time? Oh yeah. I played Ocarina of Time when it came out. I remember sitting there
[4755.99s -> 4764.04s]  playing in my bedroom. Game had just just released and it was like, holy shit, this is crazy.
[4771.37s -> 4783.82s]  Old. I mean, yeah, I was old. I mean, I mean, I am old. I don't know. How old was I? When did
[4783.82s -> 4800.52s]  it come out? Like 1996 or something. Okay. So how does this work? 1998. 24 years ago. 24, 25 years
[4800.52s -> 4819.29s]  ago. I was 14. 13. I don't know. All right. So how do I do this now? Does it have a gunk on it?
[4820.25s -> 4838.10s]  Oh, you piece of shit. It's going that way. I have to, I have to jump over here, right?
[4838.58s -> 4852.68s]  I, yes, I definitely have to jump from right here. It's going to keep walking just over there.
[4853.40s -> 4886.06s]  So it's like here. I, okay. All right. Get the runes too. Stop. What? What? I can't get it from
[4886.06s -> 4893.96s]  here? This kills me. I'm going to be pissed. All right. My runes are right here. Let's get those.
[4893.96s -> 4919.62s]  And then I have to jump from like over there. There. Right there.
[4940.09s -> 4946.78s]  Fuck you. So I just want to get there now. You know what I mean? Like I don't want to like,
[4949.34s -> 4953.74s]  I want to just fucking get there. I don't want to just do this. Get me there now. Right now.
[4955.99s -> 4968.18s]  God damn it. It's not from the cliff. What do you mean? It's not the cliff. What the fuck?
[4980.44s -> 4983.88s]  It is from the cliff. Minus 45k. I don't, at this point, I don't care.
[4985.46s -> 4992.25s]  I'll go get them in a minute. Should we have sprint spring on the lake? What is a sprint spring?
[4993.05s -> 5006.44s]  Is this Sonic the Hedgehog? What's a sprint spring? Sprint spring? Horse jump. That's,
[5006.44s -> 5011.24s]  you should just say horse jump. Sprint spring doesn't, no, it's a horse jump. Horse jump.
[5012.20s -> 5053.51s]  It's fucking midnight. I didn't think this was going to take this long to go get this stupid
[5053.51s -> 5061.67s]  remembrance. If I had known this was going to take this long, I would have just fucking
[5061.67s -> 5083.42s]  burnt the urn tree by now. What? Look, everybody's got all the, okay, there's like 17 endings in this
[5083.42s -> 5088.30s]  game, right? You're, you're bad. You're, they're all bad. You're all, there's no good. Oh, I'm a good
[5088.38s -> 5096.62s]  person. No, you burn the urn tree. You eat the fucking fire. You kill the fingers. You
[5097.50s -> 5101.82s]  kill the lady. Like, there's none, there's nothing good. There's no like, oh, you're a good guy.
[5101.82s -> 5108.46s]  No, there is no good person ending. There's like, kill this person or like eat this person, right?
[5111.43s -> 5116.71s]  We're going to end up eating someone or burning something. So I, look, I don't know what you want
[5116.71s -> 5131.67s]  to tell you. There, there is no like, oh, that's a good one. No. Okay. I'm ready to move on from
[5131.67s -> 5141.75s]  this or I freak out. Meat grinder ending. There's never been a good ending in a souls game. That,
[5141.75s -> 5156.65s]  yeah, that's, all right. So where's this, uh, spring pad? I don't see a spring pad. Don't
[5156.65s -> 5175.83s]  crush me. Spring pad. Oh, there it is. There's the sprint spring. All right. Now get over here.
[5176.47s -> 5180.98s]  What time is it? What time is it? What time is it? What time is it? What time is it? What time is it?
[5184.07s -> 5195.19s]  No, I thought it was stopping. Jump on him with the spring.
[5202.50s -> 5211.85s]  Wow. You are full of shit. You are full of shit.
[5216.02s -> 5282.41s]  Get over here. Just wait. Have you fought the fallen? Yeah, I killed it in one hit.
[5292.12s -> 5321.58s]  You can double jump. Can I? He's close. He's closer. He's closer. Okay. He's close.
[5329.35s -> 5333.51s]  Oh my God. I can't. Why are you not over here yet?
[5334.95s -> 5344.66s]  Why do you take so long to get over here? You're not going the other way, right?
[5345.38s -> 5356.57s]  All right. For everyone telling me to look at its feet. That's not how you do this one.
[5367.96s -> 5371.67s]  The fuck is right there. All right. This motherfucker is right there. You were lying
[5371.67s -> 5386.74s]  to me. It's not the jump. You were lying to me. It's over there. Okay. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[5388.14s -> 5412.73s]  literally lying to my face. Got it.
[5427.34s -> 5439.50s]  What happened? Why did that happen? I have to wait again. I have to go from a lower one. Hey,
[5440.14s -> 5443.42s]  okay. I'm going to give this five more minutes before we're going to eat this controller.
[5454.07s -> 5459.75s]  So we just, okay. I, so I was right. Who needs the thing? I, I could go from here.
[5460.31s -> 5464.79s]  I actually could go from here. You guys, I had it right from the very beginning.
[5467.67s -> 5474.07s]  No, no, you got to go down. Let me explain what you guys told me to do. You got to go
[5474.07s -> 5485.38s]  down to the lake to jump up from the spirit jump to where you were already standing. I was
[5485.38s -> 5498.42s]  already there. I, like, I would get to this edge and there were those gravestones. Remember I died
[5498.42s -> 5503.14s]  from them and you guys were like, no, dude, you're fucking stupid. You're a fucking idiot. This is
[5503.14s -> 5509.06s]  wrong. And I'm like, it's wrong. What do you mean? No, you got to go down to go up to where you are.
[5511.53s -> 5536.74s]  Uh-huh. What? Okay. So it's over here. Wait, where am I? Why is there to be so foggy down there?
[5541.46s -> 5549.59s]  See, look at all this shit. I have to go right there. Okay. See, that's where I was going.
[5550.47s -> 5556.55s]  And everybody told me you go, don't fucking rush it. Don't rush it. I rushed it. I rushed it. I
[5556.55s -> 5563.99s]  rushed it. I put a quick game. Okay. I'm just, okay, I just fucking get a trainer and just get
[5563.99s -> 5571.19s]  the resemblance. I don't want to do this again. I don't want to do this at the 15th time. This
[5571.19s -> 5575.99s]  requires patience. I just need patience, man. I just need patience. I'm going to do it wherever,
[5575.99s -> 5580.63s]  okay, I'm going to go from here. I'm going to go up the thing. This is so fucking easy.
[5580.63s -> 5586.55s]  I just don't want to spend the five minutes to wait for his slow ass to go over to the edge.
[5587.72s -> 5596.06s]  Why can't I just fucking punch him? Why can't I just? This resemblance better be worth it.
[5596.06s -> 5604.44s]  Otherwise I'm going to be pissed. This dude can't even jump on a building. I did jump on a building
[5604.44s -> 5610.76s]  and it killed me. Now I'm being told, well, Jerva, you actually went off. You have to go
[5610.76s -> 5629.53s]  from a little bit lower. I'm like, okay. Dude, this is a kid's game. Relax. This game is not for kids.
[5637.83s -> 5643.35s]  I'm not sure what would be like. Okay. Those like Elsa Spider-Man videos and like Elden Ring.
[5643.35s -> 5648.07s]  I don't know what could be worse for a child's brain. So I, you know what I mean? Like this is
[5648.07s -> 5663.75s]  not a kid's game. Don't let a kid play this. My little sister plays this game. Don't let it. Don't
[5663.75s -> 5697.91s]  let a child play this. Time is it. It's moving. Okay. Simple. It's so simple. It's easy right there
[5698.55s -> 5703.03s]  all down to a level where I can jump on it and just jump onto it. It's going to be worth it.
[5703.03s -> 5712.36s]  I'm going to become a cold sorcerer. Simple. It's so easy. Here we are. We're right here.
[5713.48s -> 5725.14s]  It's so easy. My sister's 24. Well then. All right. But yeah, don't don't do. Okay. Get off the
[5725.14s -> 5750.41s]  horse. The horses make overcomplicates this. How low do I need to be? This is where I jumped from
[5750.41s -> 5758.18s]  before. So all right. If I go from, oh my god. Okay. If I go from here, there's no, there's nothing
[5758.18s -> 5762.76s]  else I can jump from. This is the only one I can jump from. There's no other one to jump from.
[5772.34s -> 5798.82s]  Now we just have to wait an hour. Shit. It's not over there, right? It's not over there. It's
[5798.82s -> 5809.93s]  definitely here. You need to fight Mog. When I eventually get to Mog, I'm gonna snap his neck.
[5810.65s -> 5830.18s]  I'm gonna sneak up behind Mog and just grab him. Just, just turn. Turn. Uncle W. It's Mog. It's a
[5830.18s -> 5836.65s]  Mog. What do you mean? Oh no. But sneaking up on sneaking up behind Mog with a fucking
[5836.65s -> 5842.25s]  sword this long and shoving it through his back. Oh fuck. But I say I'm going to snap Mog's neck.
[5843.05s -> 5872.31s]  Oh my god. Relax. Oh my goodness. Now? Nope. Nobody said if you, I bet a three day ban,
[5872.31s -> 5892.28s]  you don't make it. If I make this ban that person for three days. Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.
[5893.24s -> 5900.07s]  I gotta get up there. You're about to be banned for three days. Turning around.
[5904.28s -> 5925.26s]  Ah! God damn it. I actually can't believe it. He's turning around. Was he not turning? I thought
[5925.26s -> 5932.63s]  he was turning around. What am I doing this for? Because there's an item in there that I really,
[5932.63s -> 5942.63s]  really need. Was he turning around though? It looked like he was turning and walking the other
[5942.63s -> 5954.15s]  way. Is it actually the jump from the horse? Go get a different one. I'm begging you. There's a
[5954.15s -> 5969.03s]  different one. Where's the other one? There are like eight. This island south of Limgrave.
[5969.59s -> 5980.87s]  One down here. But wouldn't, isn't this one, do you have to do the certain ones? I thought it like,
[5980.87s -> 5990.60s]  it didn't, it's not tied to the area? No. How come I couldn't get Ranales from the one I just went
[5990.60s -> 6005.18s]  to? It wasn't available. Behind the, next to the shack on the left side. Okay. Some are minor.
[6005.90s -> 6027.99s]  The ones with bells are the ones you need. Oh. Oh. Oh. So is this one weird or is this one just
[6027.99s -> 6032.23s]  clean as feet? This one's definitely just clean as feet. Okay. Sure. Let's go.
[6034.46s -> 6061.35s]  Why would this make walking harder? Wouldn't this make walking easier?
[6062.23s -> 6107.53s]  All right. Finally. So, fucking sick. Let's go. All right. We want Ranales.
[6111.40s -> 6119.64s]  Oh, that's so annoying. All right. I want Ranales remembrance. I want the staff from, you know,
[6120.44s -> 6127.91s]  because I want to do cold. Now, please confirm this. The full moon sorceries are cold sorceries.
[6127.91s -> 6133.67s]  Please. I'm asking you. This is, this is cold. Full moon sorcery is cold sorcery.
[6138.65s -> 6147.74s]  What's the point of me doing this? It's just the moon ones. But is, my sword counts.
[6148.54s -> 6175.51s]  But like, I think so. I hope so. It buffs all magic. It boosts moon sorcery. It doesn't boost
[6175.51s -> 6180.87s]  your sword. No, no, no. I'm talking about, I don't want to just waste this if this is wrong.
[6180.87s -> 6195.59s]  I need some lore masters to tell me. This moon blade is a moon sorcery. Right? It won't boost
[6195.59s -> 6206.46s]  the moon blade. Moon sorcery is different. No. Well, why am I doing this? It won't boost the
[6206.46s -> 6219.29s]  sword. Only moon spells. It does not boost the moon blade. Why am I doing this? Moon blade counts
[6219.29s -> 6230.94s]  as a carrion sword. Did one guy put up, put like an hour on this stream of us going and doing this?
[6231.58s -> 6243.32s]  Because the whole, the whole point was to get that new staff. It's a good staff regardless.
[6246.10s -> 6262.12s]  Carrion glintstone staff is the one that boosts this spell. Do I have that? I'm going to sorcerers
[6262.12s -> 6270.71s]  that might enact the role of knight enhances carrion sword sorceries. This is, that's a carrion,
[6270.71s -> 6287.69s]  but it's an OP staff. You're already here. Might as well just do it. I already told me to do this.
[6289.11s -> 6292.07s]  The best staff and upgrades the moon spell, which is the best spell in the game.
[6292.71s -> 6310.15s]  It's a snow witch sorcery. Well, then I'm going to have to get some more moon shit.
[6310.79s -> 6327.90s]  I mean, what do I need? I need 60 int to put this on. Moon does not matter. Only two moon spells.
[6329.58s -> 6336.90s]  It's the best. This is, is this the best? Whatever. I'm just, I'm buying it. I'm going to take it
[6337.62s -> 6347.08s]  because I'm going to use it eventually here, but a boost full moon sorceries.
[6348.92s -> 6361.77s]  It starts. This is also as scaling. That was a great, like 45 wasted minutes. Let's, let's,
[6361.77s -> 6367.83s]  let's continue the play through. Do you think so? Oh, duplicate it again to get the moon.
[6377.43s -> 6382.71s]  This was a filler episode. No, it's not. We're about to do real fucking content. You better get
[6382.71s -> 6406.01s]  ready. The moon is too slow. All right. Enough. Get, I'm going to get my fucking runes and we're
[6406.01s -> 6412.89s]  going to continue to play the game. And, uh, that was, you know, great content. It was, uh, about
[6412.89s -> 6435.58s]  30 to 40 minutes of just wasted time. Um, all right. Runes are long gone. What do I mean? Wait,
[6435.66s -> 6459.53s]  are they? Your runes are gone away. I didn't have 40,000 runes. It died, died like 10 times.
[6459.53s -> 6469.88s]  Oh yeah. Don't worry. You don't get out of bed for less than 50 K hypers.
[6471.00s -> 6479.94s]  So what's at this lake? Probably a monster. Let's explore the lake. Oh, I like the ice.
[6479.94s -> 6486.55s]  Something's going to come through the ice. I love this ice. Look at it's breaking. Yeah. I can see
[6486.55s -> 6490.87s]  the game. I can see the video game engine. I can see it. It's pieced together. Something's
[6490.87s -> 6498.07s]  breaking out of this ice. It's going to be an ice dragon. I'm going to come through the ground
[6498.07s -> 6506.81s]  and it's going to be insane. I was going to make sure I get a good view. Something here.
[6507.45s -> 6558.60s]  Where is it? Just heard it. What the fuck? That was quick. My fucking God. I'm awful.
[6559.48s -> 6598.86s]  Oh my God. I'm not good. Ash of war. Sepuku. Sepuku. Use one swords. Uh, Sepuku, a forbidden
[6598.86s -> 6604.62s]  technique used by swordsmen from the lands of reeds. Punch the blade into your stomach
[6604.62s -> 6609.10s]  to stain it with blood. Increases attack power and improves ability to inflict blood loss.
[6610.34s -> 6622.15s]  That's probably amazing. That sounds incredible. Get that on a fast weapon. It's OP. Yeah. It's
[6622.15s -> 6631.94s]  really OP. I imagine. All right. Where's the ice dragon? I want a good view. Right here. Here
[6631.94s -> 6654.76s]  it comes. Come on. Give me a good view. Yeah. Oh, here it comes. Here it comes. Where is it?
[6654.76s -> 6662.33s]  I didn't get a good view. It's an ice dragon, isn't it? It is an ice dragon. I told you.
[6663.13s -> 6683.61s]  I was certain we were getting an ice dragon right here. This motherfucker definitely drops
[6683.61s -> 6714.82s]  ice sorceress. You know it. Force force. I thought, okay, this is why I didn't move.
[6715.98s -> 6721.66s]  Why? I thought I didn't. I thought it was going up to do the thing where it hovers and then lands.
[6721.66s -> 6732.66s]  So I was going to dodge it and then get on the horse. Oh, you know what? That's not a bad idea.
[6732.66s -> 6745.05s]  I can cast this on the horse. Holy shit. What? Are you serious? I can actually do that? I'm in a
[6745.05s -> 6752.09s]  fucking weird mood. I'm sorry. Can you please do the me strong stream after you beat the game?
[6752.09s -> 6755.69s]  Everybody wants the me strong stream, but I don't know if I want. It's like, I don't want to like.
[6757.21s -> 6785.32s]  Oh, okay. Why did I do that back there? Holy shit. Actually kind of good. It's actually awful here.
[6786.20s -> 6835.30s]  Yeah, it's awful. He moves around. Stamina, please. Where are you going? What are you doing?
[6836.10s -> 6929.26s]  That was weird. Oh shit. What the fuck? Wait. Oh, my eye. It hit me in the eye. That felt
[6929.26s -> 6934.46s]  like it hit me in the eye in real life. I feel like my eye hurts. It hit me in the eye.
[6935.82s -> 6946.89s]  I can't see. It like scratched my eye. I like that scratched my eye. That was crazy.
[6947.77s -> 6963.58s]  What? There's no power. That was, I feel like it hit me in the face. Okay. Um, it was like,
[6964.30s -> 6969.58s]  was that 3D for anybody else here? That really felt like 3D. Like it came out of the screen and like.
[6971.77s -> 6977.43s]  Okay. Um, so there's no, that's unfortunate. I thought I was going to get like an ice power.
[6977.99s -> 6983.13s]  Well, that's cool though. There goes that dragon. That means we have completed that area.
[6983.77s -> 6997.86s]  Market. I didn't have any. Okay. Well, wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's not it.
[6998.42s -> 7005.40s]  Let's take a look out around the edges. Oh, it's a faith. Right, right, right, right.
[7005.96s -> 7015.86s]  You have a hundred thousand runes. I'm not going to lose a hundred thousand runes right now.
[7015.86s -> 7020.97s]  I already lost 50k. I'm just checking in the area. There's nothing else here.
[7021.69s -> 7028.57s]  Exactly. That's why I came here. I want to take a look. I like this area. This area makes my teeth
[7028.57s -> 7051.94s]  hurt. It's kind of cool. So that's just a big dragon. So, uh, this is a good place to wrap around.
[7051.94s -> 7055.70s]  Wait a minute. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. The edge of the, uh, lake is a thing over there.
[7055.70s -> 7070.52s]  I think probably like a church. This game is physically hurting you. Old era. Yeah. Like
[7080.52s -> 7101.11s]  it makes you turn purple too. Syn, synesthesia. What is that? It is a church. All right. I actually,
[7101.11s -> 7112.78s]  I'm pretty desperate for a better heal for this one in here. You need to replace your dentures.
[7118.84s -> 7127.51s]  Zomberstone miners bell bearing. Oh, thank God. Yes. Nice. Nice. Nice. Very nice.
[7132.33s -> 7145.91s]  250 vitality. I think I have like 42. There we are. A sacred tear. What do you have to say?
[7149.27s -> 7157.78s]  Spoken echoes linger here. Words of Queen Marika who vanished long ago. If you wish,
[7158.50s -> 7165.86s]  I will share them with you. I'm interested. It's you and this is America. America's own words.
[7166.74s -> 7175.94s]  Hark, brave warriors. Hark, my Lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds. Guidance hath delivered
[7175.94s -> 7183.78s]  you through each ordeal to the place you stand. Put the giants to the sword and confine the flame
[7183.78s -> 7193.38s]  atop the mountain. Let a new epoch begin an epoch glistening with life. Brandish the Elden Ring
[7194.18s -> 7205.94s]  for the age of the tree. Yeah. Um, and I'm using the bathroom right now. There are no baths. I,
[7205.94s -> 7213.21s]  I dig a hole and I go and this is kind of a weird time for you to be here. Appreciate the help though.
[7219.06s -> 7241.96s]  Classic fucking joke. Oh, oh, my mouth. What the fuck? Somebody this game's hurting me.
[7241.96s -> 7256.17s]  I just like bit a piece of skin off. This game hurts me. I like bit my skin on my lip
[7256.81s -> 7263.80s]  and it was like, ow. Oh, that's it. Wait, do you have any more to say?
[7264.68s -> 7281.77s]  Oh, that's cool. Pretty cool, dude. Uh, I definitely need to, how many, how much do I have?
[7282.97s -> 7290.55s]  I need 60 to put that staff on. So let's see what I have the talisman. 58. I need two more
[7290.55s -> 7295.19s]  int and I can put the staff on. I think I might be able to get close. Let's find out.
[7295.75s -> 7306.90s]  I think it's because you have a UTI. Thanks doc.
[7308.66s -> 7329.69s]  Secret tier. Oh, sorry. My ear was itchy. I could do that too. I had five. I thought I only had four.
[7330.57s -> 7346.90s]  Oh shit. All right. We'll do tenon, the tenants break. Very cool. So I did this. Let's market
[7346.90s -> 7352.10s]  just as completed. The sword means it has been complete. There is this bird tree. We're going
[7352.10s -> 7361.91s]  to do the urge tree. I'm gonna just head this way. What was over here? I'm not going to teleport
[7361.91s -> 7368.82s]  because it might be something on the way. There's also this volcano manor thing, which I thought I
[7368.82s -> 7382.74s]  couldn't do. Okay. That sounds like a plan to me. Keep going. What about the fort? Isn't that,
[7382.74s -> 7393.94s]  isn't that this here? Fort to the north. Do you not see a marker on it? There's a marker on it.
[7401.67s -> 7409.72s]  Fight Mog. I will fight Mog when I feel like it. And now I'm going to wait till the final stream.
[7410.76s -> 7415.16s]  I'm going to summon him. I'm going to, I'm going to use his item,
[7416.79s -> 7420.79s]  like on the edge of a cliff. I'm going to summon him in front of me and he's going to fall like
[7420.79s -> 7433.26s]  wily coyote style and die. Back over here. All right. That can go that way. What's this? Ooh,
[7433.98s -> 7439.37s]  there's a spring jump and there's a casket. This is uncovering.
[7439.37s -> 7476.34s]  Don't get me dogs. That's actually kind of good against dogs, even though I use like three potions.
[7481.21s -> 7484.09s]  Oh yeah. Yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. I can definitely level up now.
[7485.21s -> 7489.35s]  And then I'm going to have to commit to putting a bunch of stones into that thing.
[7490.07s -> 7494.42s]  I hope that's actually a good staff and it wasn't a huge mistake.
[7504.28s -> 7506.68s]  Best move in the game. I don't think it's the best move in the game.
[7507.56s -> 7513.83s]  You know what's really crazy about this? Like these caskets, they're kind of everywhere.
[7513.83s -> 7518.36s]  People are like coming out of these caskets and coming back to life.
[7519.99s -> 7526.63s]  Weird. Why are these like tarnished? It's interesting. These are because there's been
[7526.63s -> 7534.63s]  at least like two of these in every single zone and they always have the little runes on them.
[7534.63s -> 7542.15s]  Like that's the last little bits of their like souls or something. They all, yeah,
[7542.15s -> 7548.25s]  they like wake up and like get up and start walking around. Really weird, but let's do this.
[7551.80s -> 7556.68s]  Is that, is there anything else down there that I didn't, it might be a dungeon down here though.
[7567.54s -> 7576.38s]  It's probably a dungeon here. Just look. Is it gonna kill me? It's gonna, it's gonna kill me,
[7576.38s -> 7591.99s]  isn't it? Let me see if there's like dungeon right here. I feel like there would be. It's not. Stop
[7591.99s -> 7598.78s]  using the baby toy weapon. It's, it's really good. It's been great so far. Why, why would I stop
[7598.78s -> 7602.86s]  using it? It's been actually fantastic. It's been a great weapon. It's helped. It's been amazing.
[7602.86s -> 7607.56s]  It's been, it's actually been a really good weapon. It's a great weapon. Why would I check it up?
[7611.21s -> 7615.67s]  It's low to mid. Whatever. It's a great, it's a great weapon. It's a good weapon.
[7616.55s -> 7648.65s]  I like it. Guardian's Garrison. Oh my god, there's another fucking dog. Okay. Okay. Okay. We've got
[7648.65s -> 7694.07s]  him. Okay. What the fuck? I can't fucking do it. What's happening? Somebody get in there and die.
[7703.51s -> 7710.95s]  This is the most chaotic, sloppy piece of shit I've ever seen. This is, look at how sloppy this is.
[7711.03s -> 7719.86s]  What a sloppy piece of shit that was. That item, I feel like I'm like, oh wow, one, two, three,
[7719.86s -> 7724.90s]  four, five. There are five enemies there. Let me like, cast the cloud of raining crystals.
[7724.90s -> 7739.59s]  And I just aggro like eight people. I'm, I'm, okay. This is why I don't like using the sorceries that
[7739.59s -> 7746.34s]  often. Cause you just like stand still and like move one mile per hour to go like this. Cause you
[7746.34s -> 7750.90s]  really so badly want the move to look cool and to work. And then you just end up aggroing like
[7750.90s -> 7755.38s]  fucking 30 people. And then I, oh, I want to like, oh, it's going to kill like those four people.
[7755.38s -> 7760.73s]  I could have hit those guys three times and they would die. One, two, three, die. Like why do I need
[7760.73s -> 7769.53s]  to go like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh dude, it did like 150 damage. Just kill them.
[7769.53s -> 7796.17s]  Kill them. Like this. Ready? Watch this. I'm gonna fucking stab it up.
[7806.41s -> 7812.01s]  Sucks too. All right. See, it happened to you too. You could have just swung the fucking sword at me
[7812.01s -> 7815.93s]  twice and killed me. Instead you have to show your chat, like the cool move you have.
[7817.53s -> 7836.15s]  And then it got you killed. When are you going to play the real Dark Souls? Like Dark Souls one?
[7836.87s -> 7849.78s]  He doesn't know how to dodge. Bro, I beat nobody in the game first try so far. So nevermind.
[7850.34s -> 7872.98s]  Time that person up for five minutes though. All right. So what do we got here?
[7883.40s -> 7893.96s]  Didn't go through that. Come on. I said, do something funny. I feel like the last five
[7893.96s -> 7899.32s]  minutes straight have been funny of me trying to like, I feel like that was funny.
[7900.66s -> 7905.94s]  Was that not funny? I feel like it could have been funny. I feel like that was funny.
[7907.86s -> 7917.74s]  I feel like the last like an hour has been kind of funny because I went on a wild goose chase for an
[7917.74s -> 7922.87s]  hour through a thing I didn't even need to do. And like a few people in chat were telling me
[7922.87s -> 7927.67s]  that I could have gone another way and I didn't listen to them. And I just literally jumped off
[7927.67s -> 7935.77s]  a cliff 13 to 14 times in a row. It was kind of funny. It was kind of funny. Oh, you want,
[7935.77s -> 7940.89s]  you want me to do something funny? Like you want me to like tell a joke? Okay, I get it. Um, sure.
[7941.69s -> 7958.23s]  Why did the flame guard, why does this person have a name? What the fuck was that? Uh, why did
[7958.23s -> 7997.24s]  the chicken cross the road? To get modded and ban that guy for a day. All right, I need to go up.
[7997.24s -> 8003.42s]  He's power hungry. Yes, I am. These late night streams, I swear to god, I'm fucking wrong with
[8003.42s -> 8007.98s]  me. I promise if you're like a new viewer, I promise I'm not this weird all the time.
[8007.98s -> 8016.12s]  Sometimes, but not all the fucking time. Not the whole time. I don't think I think I have to go
[8016.84s -> 8024.01s]  on the edge. Maybe like up that way. Is there a ladder here? Shit, I didn't see the ladder.
[8024.81s -> 8040.58s]  People keep calling you a psycho. What's your response? Um, I don't know. How do I respond to
[8040.58s -> 8049.70s]  that? First, I say I just, you know, it's me just hanging out fucking around. And I think I would
[8049.70s -> 8061.74s]  say I would, I don't think that's accurate. I would say eccentric. All right, let's check.
[8067.66s -> 8081.34s]  Oh, nice. Anybody that calls themselves eccentric is usually, is there anywhere else I can do over
[8081.34s -> 8102.55s]  there? Cool. I can get up. All right, go that way. I'm not, no, I'm kidding. I'm not like calling.
[8103.19s -> 8121.11s]  I'm just fucking around. Well, a good thing I, I did not know you're in here and you're a way
[8121.11s -> 8148.92s]  scarier dog. Jesus, chief guardian. What's this? What the fuck? What was that? All right. That was
[8148.92s -> 8156.68s]  kind of annoying. That was like one, two, three, but that was quick.
[8179.74s -> 8188.42s]  Dogs can't climb ladders, right? That'd be actually kind of funny. It's like somebody
[8188.42s -> 8204.36s]  mastered the art of becoming a human. Is that me? I have no idea what you're talking about.
[8218.82s -> 8246.30s]  These guys give a lot of, uh, souls. Keep going. I'm usually the joker. Yeah. All right. Where does
[8246.30s -> 8250.70s]  this guy even come from? Oh, he's here. The whole, all right. I get to go, go, go, go, go,
[8250.70s -> 8264.54s]  priority priority. Shit. Bad. Very bad. Very bad. Get the souls and just die. I'm alive. I'm
[8264.54s -> 8280.06s]  alive. Get me out of this room before he kills me. This is a stupid fire thing. God the fuck out
[8280.06s -> 8300.30s]  of here. Oh my God. This guy's got a, it's going to be hard. That shield protects tons of magic
[8300.30s -> 8347.37s]  damage. Jesus. That's awesome. Can I have that? It's free. Just spam it. Oh, I'm alive. One-eyed
[8347.37s -> 8358.94s]  shield. That guy was worth a lot of souls. That was fun. Okay. So what is that? 36 strength.
[8360.65s -> 8366.44s]  Great shield. Brick some shield made from white stone depicting a malformed one-eyed god.
[8367.42s -> 8377.38s]  Barrel of a firearm pokes through the open mouth. Once worshiped by the giants, this evil deity is
[8377.38s -> 8389.98s]  believed to have been slammed by Queen Merica. Evil deity. So you get the cannon. This doesn't
[8389.98s -> 8396.36s]  require anything besides strength. So that's actually really cool. I wonder how much damage
[8396.36s -> 8401.90s]  it does when you upgrade it. This one's cool too. This doesn't require faith. This is the big fire
[8401.90s -> 8413.11s]  one. This one needs way more strength though. The gun shield. That's cool. Very cool. All right. So
[8413.91s -> 8423.38s]  continue. I think that was a pretty good sorcery fight. It does about 2100 damage to adds. Wow.
[8423.38s -> 8448.41s]  That's actually pretty good. 2000 damage. I hear a cookie bug. You hear it? I heard it. I swear to
[8448.41s -> 8470.54s]  God. I heard it. It's not the rattle. Maybe it's up. Okay. It's probably up. Yeah. I love these
[8470.54s -> 8485.38s]  Elden Ring streams. I had a great time. I feel like something's going to get up.
[8489.42s -> 8506.50s]  Giants prayer book. What does that teach you? Giants flame take thee. Flame fall upon them.
[8507.30s -> 8516.58s]  I have a feeling that's faith. But that's cool though. Are there any mimic chests in Elden Ring?
[8516.58s -> 8526.79s]  Surprisingly no. I guess they didn't. Wait. Can I jump from here? I guess there was uh maybe lore
[8526.79s -> 8534.87s]  wise. There's no reason to have them but there's like trap chests. Not really. Yeah. I don't know.
[8534.87s -> 8541.03s]  I haven't really found one. I think I would have seen one by now. All right. Well that's cool.
[8541.67s -> 8558.14s]  Unless there's something else I can do over here which probably is. Can I do anything else this
[8558.14s -> 8565.72s]  way? I don't think so. After you beat it do you think you'll still stream it once in a while? These
[8565.72s -> 8573.32s]  streams are really fun. Okay. There's a nightmare. Uh the plan is to so after I beat it whenever that
[8573.32s -> 8585.27s]  is I want to do a couple of like kind of co-op like pvp sort of community nights where maybe
[8585.27s -> 8590.60s]  I'll do the me strong stream. It's possible. But I want to do where I just have a password and we
[8590.60s -> 8596.52s]  just do pvp. I also want to do just like invasion streams where I just kind of invade or if they
[8596.52s -> 8602.01s]  turn on invasions just kind of fuck around. I think I pretty much cleared it. Maybe there's
[8602.01s -> 8609.86s]  something else I didn't see but it's all good. This is like a back entrance. All right the next
[8609.86s -> 8619.96s]  marking is up here. You have a group password. Um I don't have online turned on right now but I will.
[8621.40s -> 8640.10s]  All right let me get out of here. So that is that. Decide on a password right now. Um
[8642.18s -> 8647.11s]  I don't have a password. I'm not going to give you a password. I did that. That was cool.
[8647.11s -> 8652.23s]  I got the prayer book and a couple of little things. Now we're going this way. I want to do
[8652.23s -> 8663.29s]  there's a marker that I have over here. Is this the volcano manor thing? This here. The urd tree
[8663.29s -> 8674.82s]  which is here. Let me put a marker on this because it is done. This is also done. I'm going to put a
[8674.82s -> 8681.48s]  marker there just because I there was an item behind that. All right I also need to go down
[8681.48s -> 8690.87s]  here at some point. So we'll do that after. Um I'm still looking up here. Go to this point here.
[8697.80s -> 8702.79s]  Go to the northern fort. I will. I'm just kind of making my way around. All right we need to go to
[8702.79s -> 8712.14s]  one. One is the urd tree like that over here. Like and maybe I can't get up here from here.
[8717.69s -> 8724.42s]  You look great for somebody with lego hair. Thanks. I hope it stays for another few years at least.
[8725.22s -> 8733.38s]  I got no gray hair is really either which is really surprising. I'm happy with the hair right
[8733.38s -> 8740.90s]  now. If it takes me into like 40 that'd be great. I've already been this way. It's probably better
[8740.90s -> 8761.11s]  to go from here. Unless let's go to this. Who asked? Somebody did. Are you on any hair medication?
[8761.11s -> 8767.82s]  No. I don't have any. I don't take any like medication for it or anything.
[8767.82s -> 8775.77s]  Just there. I am going to assure you though that it's it's not gonna it's gonna go. When it goes
[8775.77s -> 8792.17s]  it's gonna go. Ah there it is. All right. But it's all right. Whatever. I okay. I did not think
[8793.34s -> 8800.09s]  remotely that I was going to have hair for this long. I really didn't. Shack of the law.
[8800.09s -> 8810.94s]  Traveling maidenhood? Like a maiden outfit? Wood worn by traveling maidens.
[8811.58s -> 8816.70s]  Maidens traverse the lands between for different reasons. Some just seek audience with the fingers.
[8816.70s -> 8821.10s]  Others to find the tarnished who they were destined to guide. Stop! What's happening over here?
[8829.74s -> 8851.16s]  Finger maiden. Traveling maiden. What's the difference? Traveling maiden? Okay. Is there a
[8852.04s -> 8866.84s]  I do not see. I'm kind of afraid of this. Is there not a grace over here? Okay well I I I
[8866.84s -> 8877.14s]  there's no grace here. I don't think. What is there one over here? Day one of German not reading my
[8877.14s -> 8886.70s]  messages. Start the counter over again. Nothing here. Wait what's that? Okay there might be
[8886.70s -> 8890.62s]  something right there. I don't want to do this until I have I have too many souls to lose.
[8891.26s -> 8912.38s]  Let me see if this one right here. What are you doing here? All right let's check and see if
[8912.38s -> 8943.93s]  this one here. Is there a grace? All the way up. Did I go in those? Oh shit. I'm going in here.
[8945.45s -> 8949.96s]  Star gazers ruins. All right well there's definitely a dungeon here.
[8950.68s -> 9001.56s]  Maybe not but you know. I did have this marked anyways. I had it marked. Is there you held shut
[9001.56s -> 9031.29s]  by a seal? It is this. It's this. It is this. Can I talk? Summon a jellyfish here. Does that do
[9031.29s -> 9057.03s]  anything? Does it work? These things are like. Did I lose that? A seal was broken. Did I lose
[9057.03s -> 9076.55s]  that summon? Still here. Let's just get this shit out of me. Where is it? Oh that's a grovel for
[9076.55s -> 9095.86s]  mercy. Curt C? No it's like spin. Where is it? Okay I see it. Okay so now what's down here?
[9098.68s -> 9123.13s]  Oh fucking starlight. I'm annoying I think. Primal glintstone blade. Spells consume less
[9123.13s -> 9137.72s]  FP but maximum HP is reduced by a lot. Oh my god. This is almost. It's 300. It's not. It's worth it.
[9138.44s -> 9166.49s]  That's a lot of HP to lose. That's too much HP to lose. That's a lot of HP. Try it. Okay so what does
[9166.49s -> 9191.90s]  it do with it all? Is it like 30% or so? I mean it seems significant. Keep in mind the staff that I
[9191.90s -> 9206.22s]  have on is makes me. Everything cost more. It's definitely doing a little bit. That's two, three,
[9207.34s -> 9227.26s]  four, five, six. Okay so what about with it off? Is it maybe one extra spell? One. It's two extra
[9227.26s -> 9235.50s]  spells. It's. I can cast two more times. That's actually kind of good. That health reduction
[9235.50s -> 9241.21s]  though is really really bad. Where's my health right now? It's like right at the edge of the compass.
[9246.44s -> 9251.00s]  Oh yikes. That's bad. I'll try it for a little while but I can't promise I'm going to keep this on.
[9251.64s -> 9260.66s]  Although. Especially when I start using the other staff. Once the other staff goes on it's reduced
[9260.66s -> 9268.47s]  by even more because this staff makes me cast faster but everything costs more. Very cool.
[9269.69s -> 9280.04s]  Well that's probably worth it. We'll see. I'm open to trying it. It did replace the
[9280.76s -> 9284.92s]  FP from killing enemies though which hasn't really been that much of a factor.
[9285.80s -> 9298.23s]  I will be honest over the last stream or two. I need to level up because I have enough to put
[9298.23s -> 9307.10s]  the new staff on and we're going to commit to it. That was kind of that was kind of ridiculous.
[9307.10s -> 9315.10s]  All right cool. So now we need to go here. Is there a grace here somewhere though? Come on man.
[9318.90s -> 9322.18s]  Can't wait for the Elden Ring vids. Are you going to replace the baby rattle?
[9322.82s -> 9329.77s]  At this point I don't know if I can. I have enough probably somber stones or smithing stones
[9329.77s -> 9336.12s]  to get something like plus seven but I still have not found the final smithing stone yet.
[9337.00s -> 9363.72s]  At least for the somber variety. I don't know. I need to be down. Hey what the fuck is it this?
[9364.68s -> 9403.13s]  Is that is this a boss? Oh my god don't hurt him. He's shooting fucking laser beams at me.
[9404.01s -> 9478.30s]  Can I not target him? Come on go. This runs out. Whack him. He's get out of this like fucking
[9478.30s -> 9504.84s]  tombstone shit. Get out of there. He's stuck in like the fucking mountain thing. I don't get any
[9504.84s -> 9514.68s]  soul. Like nothing. Zero. Not even runes. Nothing. Absolute zero. And no item.
[9514.68s -> 9541.37s]  Unless it's hidden back here. Okay. So uh don't beast eye quivers. This fucking has so many of
[9541.37s -> 9557.96s]  these things. What the fuck? Um what? There's a hundred of them. There was so many of those.
[9557.96s -> 9571.83s]  Give me a break. Well I gotta go back there. Okay so that the plan is okay so this is what
[9571.83s -> 9586.58s]  happened. I um I uh this is far away. I didn't keep going and trigger the rest of them. That
[9586.58s -> 9615.22s]  would have been very a lot more surprising I think. God damn it I have to go all the way around.
[9615.22s -> 9646.97s]  There's summons. All right go around. I think I missed that. All the way. I need a race though.
[9648.12s -> 9670.25s]  Fuck. Is there one seriously like right here? I feel like down here. I'm looking down here.
[9672.73s -> 9681.70s]  Yeah. No no no I need my souls. Why is there so much random shit here? Death right bird? Um
[9681.70s -> 9692.86s]  I don't want to lose those souls. I have to run. Was there a grace? Oh my god. Okay grace.
[9693.66s -> 9702.02s]  Grace over here somewhere. Not gonna happen. You're not gonna fucking kick me off the edge.
[9702.02s -> 9752.25s]  Is there a grace here? It's close. Oh you piece of shit. I was I'm already gotta win.
[9752.25s -> 9758.97s]  What is this doing down here? I'm just trying to get away from the stupid giant skeleton people and
[9758.97s -> 9778.36s]  this is a giant bird down here with magical power. At least I'm right here. Are you fucking kidding
[9778.36s -> 9793.75s]  me? Oh I thought that was a grace. I'm killing this thing right fucking now. I'm pissed. Get off
[9794.23s -> 9796.63s]  Get off. Yeah get me off. I don't want to I don't want to be on the horse right now.
[9797.19s -> 9862.09s]  Fucking move is stupid. It's just like lingers. That move is stupid. It's just like he just grazes
[9862.09s -> 9866.66s]  it down and it's just like you can't hit recover from it. It just permanently just
[9868.50s -> 9881.37s]  That move is fucking stupid. The souls don't matter anymore. It's already over.
[9917.83s -> 9970.55s]  Oh my god. They don't explode right? You with that bullshit. Okay maybe I have to be on the horse.
[9970.55s -> 9987.06s]  Can you dodge through that? I feel like that lingers. Bring out the snake. See what you got.
[9992.31s -> 10007.27s]  Not bad. Does it hurt? He just got fucking staggered. All right well he's cool. The fire
[10007.27s -> 10016.10s]  is cool though. Oh well. Maybe I do have to stay on the horse. Although I'd rather fight it off the
[10016.10s -> 10021.27s]  horse. Maybe get on the horse when he does that move. I don't like fighting stuff on the horse.
[10022.07s -> 10039.74s]  Hmm that's bad. I don't like fighting on the horse.
[10043.61s -> 10047.53s]  It's like too awkward like the running around on the camera. It's like too hard to keep. I was
[10047.53s -> 10063.29s]  doing better with it off the horse. Let's try the boys. They're probably just gonna get scared and
[10063.29s -> 10087.32s]  run away. All right let's go boys. All right I gotta jump over that. This cameraman is gonna
[10087.32s -> 10101.53s]  drive me fucking crazy. Whoa he just started. What the fuck? He wasn't even looking at me.
[10102.49s -> 10110.52s]  This motherfucker wasn't even looking at me. He's like oh I'll attack you guys. Now you.
[10111.24s -> 10124.26s]  All right this guy sucks. Uh this is gonna be a lot harder than I thought. Strategies. You gotta
[10124.26s -> 10128.10s]  hit him in the head. He does that explosion. I gotta see that explosion move again. Otherwise
[10128.10s -> 10134.15s]  I don't know about this. I could get right up in his ass. Like it takes too long to get over there.
[10134.79s -> 10181.27s]  It's better. Where's he? Good job boys. Excellent work boys. Oh my god he's gonna explode.
[10186.06s -> 10221.62s]  Me. Who did that? One of the boys literally just stunned him. Holy shit. I don't know which one he
[10221.62s -> 10230.17s]  did that. Somebody like somebody staggered him. Did somebody actually stagger? Holy shit that was
[10230.17s -> 10257.45s]  so important. Wow he sucked. That boss was awful. What is that thing? Where is it? Is it like a staff?
[10257.45s -> 10265.66s]  Oh here it is. Ritual spirit used by priests of old who were permitted to come among the death
[10265.66s -> 10270.47s]  birds. Priests became guardians of the birds through the rite of death which also serves
[10270.47s -> 10277.24s]  an oath sworn to their distant resurrection. First the spear high bearing prayers into the sky to
[10277.24s -> 10296.52s]  summon a downpour of spectral spears. We need to see what that looks like. Okay. Damn. This does
[10296.52s -> 10315.19s]  not use. Oh that's used mana. Okay. I wonder how good that is. So that scales. It's d int d dex but
[10315.19s -> 10319.80s]  you need a more. I need strength. It's a little too slow though. That's cool. That's cool.
[10321.34s -> 10328.65s]  Makes your hat glow. That's really cool. Okay well now I have enough intelligence now. Now I can
[10328.65s -> 10335.59s]  get my I got my 70 000 souls back. It's time to get to 60 intelligence and it's time to get this
[10335.59s -> 10345.96s]  level the fuck up. That was an intense fight. It's a little like shit that he put on the ground but
[10348.07s -> 10352.01s]  boys really pulled through there. If you by the way if anyone's curious
[10352.89s -> 10357.77s]  um people like wait those that's a those summons are terrible like that's literally the like the
[10357.77s -> 10372.78s]  worst summon in the game and not when they're plus nine and soon to be plus 10 okay it's still
[10372.78s -> 10380.02s]  that to do but let me find a grace that's important i don't know if i seriously i don't
[10380.02s -> 10383.14s]  know if i did enough damage to do that or if somebody one of them actually did that
[10384.02s -> 10389.21s]  maybe with the with the fire the torch it was like tap tap tap tap tap don't maybe i wonder
[10390.17s -> 10403.35s]  i actually really don't know to be honest the summons obviously it's like oh yeah the summons
[10403.35s -> 10409.64s]  are cool it's the volume right i know it's like oh dude use this one this this person's awesome
[10409.64s -> 10417.46s]  we put the serpent out there and i got annihilated not plus nine but still having just five things
[10417.46s -> 10423.62s]  just walk around aimlessly just bump into walls is there another fucking boss oh my god don't die
[10423.62s -> 10428.20s]  here i need to get out of here now i gotta get the fuck out of here right now it's grace right
[10428.20s -> 10437.18s]  there okay get out get out get out give me the fuck out of here right now safe for me to jump
[10437.18s -> 10450.15s]  off this okay i see it i'm not losing those again not a chance i haven't done this oh this is the
[10450.15s -> 10461.69s]  next thing i want to see there is something okay get off just please get me out of here
[10463.13s -> 10467.46s]  oh i have like i just got like a wave of just fear right there okay
[10471.38s -> 10486.62s]  i think i have a crunchie i need the souls anyways to level up the other staff so we're
[10486.62s -> 10499.86s]  gonna just do it i'm gonna need to actually do a lot more than this so i'm at 60 int
[10511.19s -> 10522.60s]  i want some more um might take a break in a minute after this i want to get some more water
[10522.60s -> 10534.89s]  maybe some more tea let's see do you get a healthy amount of sleep yes i do stop doing this
[10538.95s -> 10542.79s]  i keep just biting my lip and just you know what i'm saying why do i keep doing that
[10552.25s -> 10561.88s]  yes i do i get i get a good amount of sleep i do get some chapstick i have it right here
[10562.52s -> 10590.36s]  what did you vote for in 2004 what it's like well what if it was the 2004 election
[10590.92s -> 10623.62s]  how long goes that that was i old enough to vote 18 years ago how old am i now i have some ball
[10623.62s -> 10630.41s]  bearings to give smithing miner and somber miner so these i'm gonna be able to buy pretty much all
[10630.41s -> 10639.06s]  of them i can buy up to somber six now which actually that's a huge deal 12 000 souls
[10639.70s -> 10650.12s]  up to all right so if those of you are ever concerned about um out there anymore i have
[10650.12s -> 10658.65s]  enough materials you were like probably in 19 i don't i don't know what was that was that
[10659.29s -> 10667.34s]  like bush was george bush running for president i don't know that's a very long time ago i needed
[10667.34s -> 10688.25s]  to look at a chart okay let's go to the smith it was bush and carrie that's when i started playing
[10688.25s -> 10702.65s]  runescape that's when that's when i started playing runescape in 2004 i gotta equip it
[10702.65s -> 10711.72s]  because i'm not looking through all that there it is what do you mean i don't have enough
[10711.72s -> 10728.36s]  intelligence to put it on 59 i thought i had 60 we're doing it anyways okay where is it
[10728.92s -> 10746.71s]  who the fuck is it where are the staffs oh where is i don't have the somber smithing stone one
[10747.94s -> 10759.74s]  uh you know what fuck it we're coming back like i can't i can't even use it yet anyways
[10759.74s -> 10765.94s]  let's just keep going i thought i had 60 that's my that's my bad that's my fault i thought i had 60
[10766.66s -> 10773.70s]  let's go whatever stop swearing i promise i will not say a swear word for the next 15 straight
[10773.70s -> 10814.68s]  minutes castle soul i think that was hurt that one getting up is that one getting up across breath

[10914.52s -> 10931.40s]  that was a lot of squares well starting now i did not expect that uh let's go this is a pretty big
[10931.40s -> 10946.33s]  place i'm gonna say i want to start left here starting now yeah maybe get over that was intense
[10955.03s -> 10959.40s]  i think being i don't like how the thing's right there it's just anxiety inducing
[10959.48s -> 10972.12s]  um i i need to start doing this because okay this is where i was in here i need to my brain
[10972.12s -> 10976.86s]  needs this i know a lot of people are gonna be like why are you doing that like i did this
[10976.86s -> 11004.34s]  section here you know what i mean like so i'm like where is it for flying i don't want to go up yet
[11005.14s -> 11013.53s]  i want to do the whole ground level first essentially at least most of it okay again
[11014.49s -> 11021.05s]  mark it because i so my brain just has so much trouble i'm gonna mark that to be like i didn't
[11021.05s -> 11065.24s]  go over here yet nope no not yet you're a completionist i'm not i just want to make
[11065.24s -> 11074.25s]  sure i don't okay i thought that was something else all right so i know what's over here
[11075.45s -> 11081.10s]  i want to shut that thing up so bad i actually might just go out there and do it
[11081.50s -> 11090.74s]  so just come here is it is it clean i don't see anything to clean so wait there's
[11094.57s -> 11105.29s]  shut this thing up you're not going to go into the building i don't think this is supposed to
[11105.29s -> 11180.60s]  be doing this i just want to shut this thing up it's not sure it's too tight coming off
[11181.56s -> 11191.78s]  so
[11233.02s -> 11259.50s]  go down go down already what the fuck was that all right now can the thing's not doing that anymore

[11314.94s -> 11326.58s]  we're gonna go this way first should i get the full moon one i feel like that's a meme spell that
[11326.58s -> 11332.36s]  no one uses and you guys are just gonna ruin the rest of my playthrough i'm gonna get to like
[11333.08s -> 11339.16s]  one of the hardest bosses in the game and i could have used a different spell but i can't
[11339.88s -> 11346.34s]  because i did all the dumb bullshit that everybody told me to do or maybe i can one hit kill one of
[11346.34s -> 11358.84s]  the bosses with that we kind of cool all right so we're up here it also needs 70 intelligence
[11358.84s -> 11371.70s]  jeez freezing grease we'll just float over here what was that

[11579.58s -> 11585.02s]  goes to like 11 o'clock they say like swears and shit it's almost there we're there it's a
[11585.82s -> 11595.45s]  germa adult swim all right it's like my version of that imagine if somebody did that like from the
[11595.53s -> 11604.94s]  hours of i gotta pay attention here in the hours of like you know 12 o'clock noon to like 10 o'clock
[11604.94s -> 11611.02s]  at night they're incredibly family friendly they don't say swears they don't play any like mature
[11611.02s -> 11616.94s]  games but then like 10 o'clock rolls around and they just like saying oh fuck this shit piss
[11616.94s -> 11622.38s]  asshole that they talk a bunch of shit they play much immature games that'd be like a funny
[11623.34s -> 11645.46s]  it could be like a funny shtick i think that's literally you guys iced my streams of i've
[11646.10s -> 11673.34s]  what do you that it makes no sense to me keep going up the boss up there well i know where we're
[11673.34s -> 11692.79s]  going okay the legendary item over there it used to be family friendly maybe for like
[11693.43s -> 11721.10s]  seven months back in like 2011 he's open okay okay interesting oh great son frigid son of soul
[11721.82s -> 11725.90s]  surrender yourself to the eclipse grant life to the soul as bones
[11726.22s -> 11750.18s]  so that guy walks in here very okay cool so what what was the weapon that i just found
[11758.46s -> 11815.67s]  i lost it again there it is faith in decks storied sword and treasure of castle soul that depicts an
[11815.67s -> 11821.08s]  eclipsed sun drained of color one of the legendary armaments
[11821.72s -> 11834.95s]  so that guy walks in here very okay cool so that guy walks in here very okay cool so what what was
[11834.95s -> 11841.10s]  an eclipsed sun drained of color one of the legendary armaments and so the sight of an
[11841.10s -> 11847.32s]  eclipse inspires a dreadful awe preventing an onlooker from averting his gaze that the
[11847.32s -> 11860.12s]  lustrous sun ablaze with the prince of death's flames looking the death ailment on foes this is
[11860.12s -> 11880.42s]  a broken pvp weapon i can't use it but i'm curious interesting well i'm gonna set the bonfire though
[11880.42s -> 11889.02s]  because that unnecessary amount of damage to take legendary shuttle let's just sit at the bonfire
[11889.02s -> 11894.87s]  that spell this weapon used to instantly kill is this the thing people were talking about
[11895.43s -> 11901.88s]  this is the one that would instantly kill right it was like an unbearable um is he in the room
[11901.88s -> 11945.86s]  again it's show till wait nothing over here all right uh i'll go up a little bit it should be
[11946.66s -> 11959.06s]  definitely using sorcerers a lot more at the end of the end game here
[11959.86s -> 12001.08s]  oh wait a minute can i jump from here no shit around back okay end game he says i mean
[12002.60s -> 12012.02s]  and oh hold on quiet yeah sure whatever you say dude i would also like to swing
[12012.02s -> 12017.30s]  15 times in a row that would be i mean it'd be cool if i could do that if i would have the ability
[12017.30s -> 12050.94s]  to do that many swings in a row try that again did i go this way yet yeah this is where i went right
[12050.94s -> 12068.70s]  i am this annoying guy this is the worst enemy in the whole game well i need to be much more
[12068.70s -> 12088.25s]  prepared for that then maybe i should use a shield to prepare him oh you know what what am i talking
[12088.25s -> 12102.76s]  about i am a sorceress good luck the best part about being sorcery is you can just cheese the
[12102.76s -> 12115.02s]  fuck out of everybody i don't have to fight this guy somebody else can goodbye see you i don't have
[12115.02s -> 12125.35s]  to deal with that right this is why sorcery and faith is just so good they're just great
[12125.91s -> 12131.38s]  because i can just go run up the ladder and hide and i don't have to like be imagine being just
[12131.38s -> 12140.44s]  like a like a deck strength quality build you'd be up there throwing fire pots i think i already
[12140.44s -> 12149.56s]  i'm wearing this already except is this the work better version of it how is this one better i
[12149.56s -> 12174.47s]  found it like three zones ago okay that's all i can do up here hold on hold on a second just a
[12174.47s -> 12202.98s]  second on a second it's down here i mean that's a really suspicious place to put that if there's
[12202.98s -> 12211.80s]  nothing here all right oh it's just it's just the other side okay well i wanted to come down
[12211.80s -> 12216.12s]  anyways because actually let me now i'm not gonna set the bonfire why would i do that
[12217.00s -> 12227.74s]  i want to go this way and i'm gonna go up how come you're wearing mommy's beach hat
[12238.49s -> 12249.72s]  mommy's beach hat i wanted to go up from here so i don't get sunburned yeah so i don't get burnt
[12250.28s -> 12279.08s]  remember the dogs oh shit okay it's just one of these guys one behind me too of course there is
[12279.08s -> 12300.07s]  no why can i not lock on throwing those how can you throw that that far but i cannot
[12300.79s -> 12312.23s]  am i still too far away i killed the guy that was the distraction
[12313.75s -> 12342.01s]  holy shit oh my god oh my god i keep timing it so fucking wrong
[12351.19s -> 12359.38s]  what the fuck there's another one right there holy shit oh my god what the fuck why there's
[12359.38s -> 12379.67s]  so many of these fucking things okay what a pain in the ass whatever that's so annoying
[12379.67s -> 12389.82s]  uh should i maybe i should put a shield on just hold it out do a t-break all right if i
[12389.82s -> 12397.83s]  if i get past this area i'll do a t-break won't be long now i know no i know it's there
[12398.47s -> 12440.18s]  i could go that way too but i need the souls i could run by him what do i do there's nothing
[12440.18s -> 12444.71s]  down there where do i go i actually don't fucking know where i'm going what happened
[12445.27s -> 12450.87s]  what the fuck happened here what the fuck what did i go the wrong way is there a way
[12453.18s -> 12465.78s]  that guy's unfucking bearable that guy does did i go the wrong way i don't think that guy has i
[12465.78s -> 12470.57s]  don't think that guy has a stamina bar you just swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing
[12470.57s -> 12474.09s]  swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing it's like you don't
[12474.09s -> 12477.42s]  how do you fight that guy how are you supposed to fight that fucking thing how do you fight that
[12477.42s -> 12481.10s]  thing you don't even fight it you don't even play the game you just die how do you fight the
[12481.10s -> 12489.14s]  fucking guy how do you fight that guy you can't you can't fight him all right where where i don't
[12489.14s -> 12503.70s]  the souls are gone so fucking whatever who cares this ball this area is just like a middle finger
[12503.70s -> 12508.50s]  to the player it's just like yeah i just whatever you just every corner you turn there's gonna be
[12508.50s -> 12536.57s]  like fucking something that just spawns in front of your face i see the elevator which i believe
[12536.57s -> 12544.17s]  was down here i probably could go back to the front entrance if i step on that i'll go right
[12544.17s -> 12556.81s]  up there right i have to pull the lever you have to activate it all right well i'm just gonna run
[12556.81s -> 12563.99s]  over there well i don't i don't know i don't like this area fuck this area fuck the dual welding
[12563.99s -> 12573.03s]  fucking assholes that kill you in fucking three hits and don't stop swinging good look i don't
[12573.03s -> 12584.14s]  give a shit i don't think you can actually fight these guys i don't think you can physically fight
[12584.70s -> 12590.55s]  i think they're they're they're designed to be like obstacles there there are obstacles in the
[12590.55s -> 12599.54s]  arena it's like a spike trap you can't even pop you can't even hide okay well i got the
[12599.54s -> 12611.83s]  thing so i'm gonna go the other way you literally stagger them good luck getting a swing off and
[12611.83s -> 12630.26s]  if you miss you're dead try rolling no no quiet i'm not gonna hear this quiet okay so the elevator
[12630.26s -> 12647.05s]  was here right a little bit further down where's the elevator back here wasn't there an elevator
[12647.05s -> 12666.98s]  like right here is it further down oh it's this room with her yeah all right yeah fuck all that
[12666.98s -> 12682.33s]  i mean contraption does not move it just did it why is that not happening i have to stand on top

[12716.09s -> 12720.17s]  gonna have to do it can i summon here no you can't even summon here i was gonna say just get the
[12720.17s -> 12744.49s]  boys out here and i was fucking sacrificing and run okay here we go i have an idea there's like
[12744.49s -> 12753.06s]  the most physical defense this right this says okay here we go i was gonna hold the fucking shield
[12753.06s -> 12790.31s]  out and run but wait you are so annoying like holy shit get the fuck out of here like you just how
[12790.31s -> 12797.37s]  many of these do you get to have this endless goddamn supply of magical bombs all right get
[12797.37s -> 12815.58s]  over here oh wait wait where do we go where are we he's right behind me
[12821.05s -> 12848.02s]  i can see his shadow that's my shadow i hate these guys are the fucking worst okay
[12849.06s -> 12852.02s]  well it's activated now so i don't have to worry about this shit
[12864.95s -> 12900.30s]  i just want to see what the boss is what is the boss you didn't get in mandarin neal i have an
[12900.30s -> 12911.78s]  okay here's the play play is drink this going from here now the play is to drink that um
[12915.08s -> 12927.82s]  shit drink the thing to make infinite spells and then spam that moon blade and try to kill the guy
[12927.82s -> 12948.42s]  on the right first as fast as i can i do i also have access to the boys do i okay if i have access
[12948.42s -> 12953.98s]  to the boys then i'll do it i'm gonna drink this before going in the room right when i go in the
[12953.98s -> 12963.14s]  room some of the boys and then just spam the moon blade and hopefully i kill the guy on the
[12963.14s -> 12968.92s]  right before he even gets over to me well i think i'm safe right it's not do i have to run away
[12968.92s -> 12973.00s]  from anybody no thank god at least they have the decency to make it so you don't have to fight one
[12973.00s -> 12999.00s]  of those guys on the way here all right here we go all right boys get out of the way oh he's going
[12999.00s -> 13015.34s]  ahead all right it worked it worked to work good call good call we're good all right get him all
[13015.34s -> 13064.15s]  right holy shit what does that mean holy fuck oh no no no no no no no no way oh no okay it was a
[13064.15s -> 13078.10s]  good strategy that's how i'm gonna play that out that's a good strategy it is it was boys
[13079.16s -> 13088.86s]  flask i gotta wait to spam it though i was a little early i think i can drink the flask
[13088.86s -> 13102.44s]  after summoning the boys no no no no why would i do that because the boys will be free because i
[13102.44s -> 13107.24s]  i thought he summoned him instantly so he takes a minute he's like here i go i'm gonna summon so i
[13107.24s -> 13116.12s]  just get in there um drink the flask summon the boys and then by that point that should be good
[13116.76s -> 13126.90s]  it took a lot longer to summon those two than i thought that's why i did it instantly
[13127.70s -> 13161.98s]  okay here we go here we go oh okay did i get him only one got left all right we're fine good good
[13164.31s -> 13184.50s]  dude what the fuck man come on get him we're good all right he does a follow-up it's a follow-up
[13184.50s -> 13204.84s]  swing dude it's he does two follow-ups after that i might have to get rid of this spell now
[13205.48s -> 13224.82s]  shit hold on back it up all right you gotta get away you don't want to be near this guy for more
[13224.82s -> 13252.57s]  than a second okay all right all right all right you gotta jump no you don't i don't know oh my
[13252.57s -> 13273.78s]  goodness all right i gotta be quicker i gotta be much quicker timing's on that i got it wrong a
[13273.78s -> 13298.09s]  little bit no no not good not good i think you just need to get out oh okay all right all right
[13299.29s -> 13307.64s]  so here's what has to happen when he does that like dash in swing i don't think there's enough
[13307.64s -> 13316.09s]  time to do the carrying sword even if i get like a perfect dodge because it's like it takes a little
[13316.09s -> 13321.82s]  bit too long to be able to dodge that second like boom attack so i'm not going to use it i'm just
[13321.82s -> 13332.34s]  going to use my weapon use the mimic tier i mean the boys are doing great i got it i got it it's
[13332.34s -> 13341.02s]  just the timings i just i it's all about when he does that dash in i think it's just a single r2
[13341.74s -> 13349.50s]  or maybe just just just swing at him once and then get away i wonder if i can jump over it
[13350.14s -> 13356.52s]  can i jump over that attack when he goes like boom with the lightning can i jump i think i can
[13363.67s -> 13370.50s]  maybe even um winston i'll try it i definitely need to use this in the very beginning there's
[13370.50s -> 13381.13s]  no way i can do this about it just have to get away we'll try let's go i i felt like that was
[13381.13s -> 13384.89s]  pretty close although i feel like at least a few of these attempts are going to get really
[13384.89s -> 13388.82s]  fucked up by this part here just not killing these things fast enough
[13405.88s -> 13431.69s]  get the fuck away from me but hey what's he doing all right here we go does it two three times
[13432.49s -> 13442.86s]  hard to tell actually not that bad but once the boys are gone i'm gonna be in trouble here
[13443.66s -> 13475.91s]  fuck no again okay let's go that timing on that i gotta get it right it's a lot longer
[13476.79s -> 13502.90s]  no i don't think i could even do an r1 shit i'm in the fucking wall here maybe just one r1 and get
[13502.90s -> 13605.70s]  out okay that works damn once his friends are gone it's just about the timings damn that was
[13605.70s -> 13616.70s]  crazy that's fun but holy that beginning my god okay if you don't have if you don't have sorcery
[13616.70s -> 13621.99s]  do you just have to run around and just kite that around so you can kill those two i can't imagine
[13621.99s -> 13629.69s]  that as a strength user that must be unfucking that must be unbearable as like a melee only
[13629.69s -> 13635.45s]  character how are you supposed to do that that seems impossible strength is fine it seems so
[13635.45s -> 13658.20s]  hard that was cool all right we're good god damn oh someone's gonna carry that yeah he just sits
[13658.20s -> 13672.01s]  back and will buff until you attack him really all right now we can finally do the staff but
[13672.01s -> 13685.03s]  hold on this probably there's probably some lore shit in here that was a cool fight though i just
[13685.96s -> 13691.94s]  do not look forward to doing that as like a short sword character i feel like that would be really
[13691.94s -> 13704.58s]  difficult hold on wait don't just run around oh the weapon yeah let's see what it was what was it
[13704.58s -> 13723.27s]  what kind of weapon was it is it right here veterans prosthesis strength index
[13724.23s -> 13733.42s]  like a fist weapon yeah bladed prosthetic leg and wreath with the power of lightning
[13734.34s -> 13740.87s]  instead attached to the fist commander niel veteran of castle soul offered this prosthesis
[13740.87s -> 13745.99s]  in exchange for the lives of defeated knights held prisoner he went on to lead these men as an army
[13745.99s -> 13757.82s]  of no nation storm kick and use it like oh it's that thing he was doing oh that's actually kind
[13757.82s -> 13782.49s]  of cool that's pretty cool all right we can go pee in just a moment i promise i want to see what
[13782.49s -> 13795.59s]  else is here and then we might consider wrapping up soon not right this second but soon i would
[13795.59s -> 13805.98s]  say maybe like another hour we'll see after we get this lore dump whatever it is we'll uh we'll take
[13805.98s -> 13811.11s]  a break i'll come back maybe stream for like an hour or two maybe i don't want to go too too long
[13811.67s -> 13840.50s]  so what's up here halig tree secret medallion left lord nicola forgive me the sun has not been
[13840.50s -> 13846.95s]  swallowed our prayers were lacking the comrade remains soulless i will never set my eyes upon
[13846.95s -> 13862.73s]  it now your divine halig tree okay well i have half of the halig tree medallion
[13866.42s -> 13878.89s]  very interesting kind of curious what that is join medallions to operate grand lift of roles
[13879.53s -> 13885.42s]  branching the medallion with both halves can join will have activate the grand lift of
[13885.42s -> 13890.86s]  rolled granting access to a hidden path in other words the secret medallion will guide the bearer
[13890.86s -> 13915.98s]  to the land of michaela's halig tree what is a halig tree it's a special tree okay well very
[13915.98s -> 13931.77s]  interesting uh the game wants me to go down here so here's what we're gonna do i am going to take
[13931.77s -> 13943.82s]  a pee break we're gonna go here we're going to check out this area preferably maybe this right
[13943.82s -> 13952.73s]  here maybe take a little gander over here and then ultimately i want to end up in there so let's
[13952.73s -> 13984.78s]  mark that you have the other half i don't think so i have this one please have to pee right now
[13984.78s -> 13987.26s]  all right now i know we're doing it and when i come back i'm going to do the staff
[13988.54s -> 13992.54s]  yeah i'll be right back just go pee if it blows you that are going to bed we'll see you later

[16368.17s -> 16374.10s]  to go back to normal i've been really itching to continue to play this game so but i'm going to
[16374.10s -> 16382.95s]  put a lid on it because i want to start saturday at like four normal time not start at like 8 30
[16382.95s -> 16391.94s]  i'll go get auto i'll be right back we'll show auto for a minute for a second or two we'll have
[16391.94s -> 16396.68s]  yeah i'll be right back let's put this on at least until i come back thank you for watching everybody
[16396.68s -> 16402.02s]  really appreciate it we'll come back with auto and go grab him thanks for all the subs
[16402.02s -> 16411.30s]  there were a lot of community subs tonight thank you guys as always as you know though i
[16411.30s -> 16430.94s]  do not read subs really or bits anymore i do not on pretty rare occasions do i do that i used to
[16430.94s -> 16440.41s]  that's okay i missed the post stream hangouts yeah but they were they just they had to go they
[16440.41s -> 16447.67s]  really did i told you the two or three reasons why right it's you know you got i don't want
[16447.67s -> 16452.14s]  people to like pay me money for me to like read a message and talk to them
[16452.14s -> 16456.38s]  right it's like oh yeah it costs five dollars to get me to read your message guaranteed and
[16456.38s -> 16465.26s]  respond to it i don't i'm not into that i don't i don't want to do that anymore um as well as the
[16465.26s -> 16472.86s]  fact that we used to do the channel's gotten a lot larger too so it's just there might be so
[16472.86s -> 16477.27s]  many messages that might take hours and hours it already did a lot of times take an extra one to
[16477.27s -> 16482.14s]  two hours at the end of every stream so if i streamed for like four or five hours a lot of
[16482.14s -> 16487.19s]  times i would cut the streams shorter because i knew there was probably an hour or two left of
[16487.19s -> 16494.57s]  kind of reading uh messages and bits and stuff so now i i can just kind of go as long as i really
[16494.57s -> 16501.99s]  want to and there's not like a thing in the back of my mind that says dude you gotta be aware that
[16501.99s -> 16508.34s]  you gotta have enough energy to do like an hour or two at least of reading the bits that kind
[16508.34s -> 16512.49s]  of stuff combined together all the hell stuff like it was sitting down for more than seven to
[16512.49s -> 16518.74s]  eight hours was kind of too much for me at some point right i do appreciate it i do appreciate
[16518.74s -> 16527.48s]  anybody that gives this channel subs or gives any money to this you know as you know at this point
[16527.48s -> 16534.74s]  you the subs on this channel are there's a lot and i don't think i need to tell you guys to
[16534.74s -> 16539.21s]  continue to do that i don't think i need to tell you like oh yeah here's the incentive for giving
[16539.21s -> 16543.85s]  me money like i don't think i need to have that i don't think i don't really want that anymore
[16543.85s -> 16555.22s]  that's pretty much all there is to it if somebody wants to give me five dollars a month i'm not i'm
[16555.22s -> 16561.35s]  not going to stop them i'm not going to necessarily uh like encourage people to
